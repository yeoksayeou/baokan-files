The French colonialists, with the support of American imperialism, violating the peace-loving will of the French and Vietnamese people, have waged a war of aggression in Vietnam for a full four years. On September 23, 1945, the French colonialists occupied South Vietnam, and on December 19, 1946, the French army attacked Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, spreading the flames of war throughout the country. In these four years, under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people have won great victories in military, political, economic, and cultural fields.

(1) Military Victories

In the military field, the Vietnamese people have continuously smashed the main French invasion plans and established their own army.

The French's first conspiracy—a "blitzkrieg"—attempted to destroy the main force of the Vietnamese People's Army and, according to their estimates, the nerve center of the Vietnamese resistance in the northernmost region. In the autumn and winter of 1947, this large-scale French colonial military operation was completely defeated. In this campaign, France lost most of its elite troops. Thus, the Vietnamese war of resistance against French aggression entered a new stage—from the defensive stage to the stalemate stage.

After this defeat, the French invaders formulated a long-term plan. They attempted to first "stabilize" the occupied areas, and then gradually advance and occupy new strongholds. The second conspiracy of the French colonialists in 1948 and 1949 also went bankrupt. In these two years, especially in 1949, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance made great progress. The combat units of the Vietnamese People's Army and the local people's armed forces persisted in fighting behind enemy lines. They carried out armed propaganda, organized the masses, disintegrated the puppet regime, sabotaged the enemy's transportation and economy, caused serious losses to the enemy's lives and property in the cities, eliminated the enemy's isolated strongholds, and turned the slogan of "shrinking the enemy-occupied areas and turning the enemy's rear into our base" into practical action. From the end of 1948 to the beginning of 1949, the Vietnamese People's Army and local troops occupied dozens of enemy strongholds and liberated tens of thousands of square kilometers of land.

At the end of 1949, due to the achievements of the Vietnamese people and the great victory of the Chinese people, the French colonialists, following the advice of General Revers, adopted another plan: to ask the United States for more aid, concentrate their troops in North Vietnam, strictly blockade the Sino-Vietnamese border, and hold on to northern Vietnam. However, the recent victories of the Vietnamese People's Army on the Sino-Vietnamese border and in central North Vietnam have powerfully proved that the French colonialists' third invasion plan has failed again. In one month, the Vietnamese People's Army completely smashed the entire French defensive system along the Sino-Vietnamese border, annihilated nine elite French battalions, and liberated seven cities occupied by the French colonialists. Before this defeat, from the day it launched its invasion of southern Vietnam in September 1945 to the end of 1949, the French colonialists suffered irreparable losses, with more than 90,000 troops sacrificed. There is no doubt that the morale of the surviving French troops is declining.

On the other hand, the Vietnamese people's armed forces have become more united, stronger, and better equipped.

In the early days of the war of resistance, two-thirds of the Vietnamese regular troops were divided into small units, operating behind enemy lines and launching guerrilla warfare. Later, several small combat units formed a regiment to attack enemy convoys and isolated enemy strongholds. Later, two or three regiments were able to concentrate together to complete a battle. And now the People's Army can concentrate greater strength on a wide front. The recent operations on the French defense line in the Sino-Vietnamese border area are proof of this.

In addition to the regular troops, the local guerrilla forces of the entire Vietnamese people provide the People's Army with an inexhaustible reserve of manpower and materials. From the countryside to the cities, from the liberated areas to the French-controlled areas, guerrilla activities are widely carried out, harassing and destroying the enemy army. The following examples are sufficient to prove the important contributions of the guerrillas in the war of resistance against aggression. The guerrillas in the Third Inter-Zone of northern Vietnam fought a total of 3,361 times in ten months, killing 6,023 enemies and capturing 3,962 others. They destroyed and damaged one enemy field gun, two mortars, one aircraft, six warships, seventeen locomotives, five amphibious tanks, one hundred and thirty-nine trucks, seven jeeps, one hundred and seventeen kilometers of highway, and sixty-five thousand five hundred and eighty meters of electric wire. The Vietnamese people's local forces have grown stronger with the continuous support of the Vietnamese people. In the first four months of 1950, the people of Thanh Hoa Province in central Vietnam donated 20 million Vietnamese currency as a fund for local troops. At the end of 1949, the people of Ha Tinh Province donated 300 million Vietnamese currency in the war to support the people's local forces. In terms of military technology, the commanders and fighters of the Vietnamese People's Army have also made great progress. In the early days of the war of resistance, in some small-scale offensives, they used only broken rifles, even knives and bamboo spears, but now they have learned to use heavy weapons and can carry out relatively large-scale mobile warfare. The Vietnamese General Headquarters has also been able to command national military operations with ease and confidence. In addition to learning from the lessons learned on the battlefield, Vietnamese soldiers are constantly studying the combat experiences of other countries, especially the combat experiences of China, in the gaps between battles.

Vietnam's industrial production is backward, technical cadres are lacking, and France has implemented a strict blockade, but under these difficult conditions, Vietnam has been able to train medical cadres and manufacture military medicines, and has made great achievements. Among the many construction achievements of the Vietnamese people, the most noteworthy is the establishment of a military industry. They used old machines, primitive tools, and broken metal collected from destroyed cities, and were able to manufacture not only rifles, but also rocket launchers and mortars.

(2) Political Victories

In the political field, the Vietnamese people are closely united within the National United Front (Viet Minh), enthusiastically support the democratic government headed by Ho Chi Minh, and have smashed all the French colonialists' cunning schemes of "divide and rule." The Vietnamese workers, peasants, youth, and women are united in their respective organizations, and have done their best in the war of resistance. They have done everything possible to help the government and the army prepare for the general counter-offensive. The National United Front relies on the solid alliance of the working class and the peasantry, and includes people from all walks of life, all parties, and different religious beliefs. As President Ho Chi Minh pointed out, it has become the people's "steel wall."

The French attempt to establish "autonomous states" among the ethnic minorities to divide Vietnam has failed. At the end of 1948, the Vietnamese democratic government issued an order to eliminate the puppet regime. Since then, 95% of the puppet regime's organizations established in the countryside have collapsed. The puppet central government is often in a ridiculous situation. It constantly changes its appearance, but it is still a handful of notoriously treacherous Vietnamese elements.

On the other hand, the strength of the Vietnamese democratic government has grown with the victory of the war of resistance. The people's committees of villages and provinces held new elections in the war, allowing more workers and peasants to participate in the management of the people's power. The people actively participated in the elections, and the Vietnamese people living in the enemy-occupied areas also enthusiastically participated in the voting. In the French-occupied city of Toulon, 90% of the residents voted to elect the people's committee despite the enemy's brutal persecution. Due to the participation of representatives elected from among workers, peasants, and combat models, the people's power has been greatly strengthened in all aspects.

The government of the Republic of Vietnam provides brotherly and equal assistance to the just struggles of the people of Laos and Cambodia. The national liberation wars of Laos and Cambodia have thus made great progress. Laos has a war of resistance government, and Cambodia has a national liberation committee. Both countries have established national united fronts, people's liberation armies, and local armed forces, and have liberated vast territories.

In the international sense, the victory of the Chinese people has ended Vietnam's isolation and enabled Vietnam to closely connect with the democratic world. The recognition of Vietnam by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe can be said to be "the greatest victory in Vietnamese history." Vietnam has become an important member of the growing world democratic camp; Vietnam has received the support of progressive mankind and the French people all over the world; the French people are fighting against the colonial war in Vietnam and against the American policy of enslavement.

(3) Economic Victories

In the economic field, the Vietnamese people, on the one hand, sabotaged and blockaded the enemy's economy, and on the other hand, consolidated their own wartime economy, which is based on the people's democratic economy.

Rubber production in southern Vietnam is the main source of profit for the French colonialists in Indochina. It has now suffered serious losses due to strikes, slowdowns, and planned sabotage by Vietnamese workers. In three years, seven million rubber trees covering 17,000 hectares have been destroyed. Warehouses and other facilities in the coal mining area and several ports have suffered heavy losses due to strikes. For example, in two years, the French colonialists' losses in the port of Toulon have exceeded 13 million piastres (the paper currency issued by the French colonialists in Vietnam), and many trucks have been lost. In the Hong Gai coal mining area, as a result of strikes, slowdowns, and planned sabotage from January to March 1950, a total of 99,245,825 piastres were lost. At the same time, people's guerrillas destroyed 19 trams, 22 airplanes, and 7 transformers in Hanoi. Due to the blockade by the Vietnamese people, goods imported from the United States and France are piled up in the French-occupied cities and cannot be sold.

Due to political and military failures, the French colonialists have adopted various heinous atrocities, such as destroying dikes, destroying crops, burning shops, slaughtering livestock, occupying rice-producing areas, and blockading the bases of the Vietnamese people. The French colonialists tried their best to starve the Vietnamese people, but this conspiracy also failed. In order to protect the farmers' grain, the Vietnamese people's armed forces, after repelling the French plunderers, simultaneously launched a production increase campaign. In 1945, during the French rule, two million people died of hunger. Since the establishment of the democratic government, although the French colonialists have heinously destroyed dikes, crops, and livestock, famine has no longer existed.

During the past four years of the war, Vietnam's recovery and reconstruction work has remained a priority. Under the close cooperation of the government and private capital, a self-sufficient economy has been established in accordance with the people's democratic line. The government vigorously encourages and helps consumer and producer cooperatives and handicrafts. The equipment, medicines, and surgical instruments of hospitals, which used to rely entirely on imports, are now partially produced in the liberated areas. The increase in cotton production and the development of the textile handicraft industry have solved the clothing problem needed by the people in most areas.

(4) Financial Victories

The achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in finance are enormous. In 1945, the French colonialists left behind huge public debts, causing the most serious inflation. Vietnam had to pay huge national defense expenses for the war of resistance. Moreover, the "head tax" (whether Vietnamese or overseas Chinese, all those over the age of eighteen had to pay a large personal tax every year), alcohol, salt, and opium monopoly taxes, which the French colonialists relied on as the main source of tax revenue, were all abolished. Under such difficult circumstances, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam still achieved considerable financial achievements, which mainly relied on the active support of all the Vietnamese people. In the liberated areas, the general cost of living is lower than in the enemy-occupied areas. In July 1948, the salaries of government employees of the Republic of Vietnam were generally increased by 20% to 30%.

In terms of national finance, since the French currency was banned in the liberated areas, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued the national currency "Ho Chi Minh currency" in February 1946, and decided to issue Vietnamese gold standard coins containing 0.375 cm of pure gold in 1948. Now the currency of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam flows smoothly throughout the country, and even in some French colonialist-occupied areas, it cannot be denied.

In short, in the past four years, the Vietnamese people have victoriously established a solid national finance liberated from the shackles of imperialism.

(5) Agricultural Victories

In agriculture, all the Vietnamese people have comprehensively and enthusiastically realized the slogan of "not leaving an inch of land uncultivated, not leaving a hand idle." The Vietnamese people have reclaimed a lot of land, repaired many old dikes, and built many new dikes despite the cruel attacks and systematic destruction of the French. For example, the cultivated area increased by 371,000 hectares in northern Vietnam, and 280,000 hectares in the four provinces of north-central Vietnam. In the past four years, a total of 6.3 million cubic meters of soil, 9 million workdays, and 67 million Vietnamese currency have been spent on dike construction. Due to four years of efforts, the disasters of famine and floods that the Vietnamese people often suffered in the past have been avoided. In order to solve the shortage of rice in some areas, the Vietnamese people are planting a large amount of corn, sweet potatoes, and so on. In 1950, the output of these coarse grains increased several times compared with before the war.

(6) Victories in Social Undertakings

In terms of social undertakings, the Vietnamese People's Democratic Government has taken appropriate steps to improve the material lives of workers and peasants. Fallow land and land belonging to French colonialists and Vietnamese traitors were distributed to peasants, and these peasants further received loans from the democratic government, reaching 30,066,8167 Vietnamese currency in 1949 alone. The Vietnamese democratic government allowed a reduction of 25% or more in land rent, and a cooperative network was established. In 1949, 600 cooperatives of various kinds were established in the Tenth District alone.

In order to ensure the rights and interests of workers, a labor law was formulated in March 1948. The law stipulated the interests of workers and their participation in enterprise management. Allowances for family members were obtained, and the principle of "equal pay for equal work" was widely implemented. Basic wages are fixed according to the rationing of necessities. Trade unions guarantee that workers fully exercise their rights.

In the past four years, the democratic government has taken various steps to change the face of the lives of the Vietnamese people, such as: the "New Life" movement to develop health undertakings, strictly prohibiting the sale of opium, restricting the sale of alcohol, and prohibiting prostitution and gambling. In the vast majority of the liberated areas, begging, theft, and robbery can be said to have disappeared.

(7) Victories in Culture

The achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the cultural field can be said to be the greatest and most unexpected. In the past short four years, through the elimination of illiteracy competition, the average number of literate people is 85%. The remaining illiterate people include those living in French-occupied areas, the elderly, and ethnic minorities in border areas. By 1949, 11,580,000 illiterate people had reopened their eyes. All the population of ten provinces, including workers and youth, and 99% of the soldiers were able to read and write. In order to expand these great achievements, the government of the Republic of Vietnam has formulated concrete plans on how to further educate these literate people. Many primary, secondary, and higher education institutions have been opened, and tens of thousands of male and female students from the working class and peasants are studying in schools.

Other cultural departments such as music, literature, poetry, and painting are also developing along the three basic principles of popularization, scientification, and nationalization. Literary writers and artists go deep among the people to learn, to establish the people's culture, and to awaken the people's patriotic spirit of resisting the war.

These achievements are all achieved through the "Patriotic Competition" method. "Patriotic Competition" is the real driving force behind every Vietnamese's entire career and thoughts. For the motherland, for their beloved leader President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people compete with each other in increasing production, learning, and killing the enemy.

All the great achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the past four years have been achieved under extremely harsh conditions, and at the cost of the great sacrifices and losses of the entire Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people do not feel the slightest pride in these initial achievements they have achieved. They fully understand that there are still great difficulties waiting for them to overcome in the future. They must not only resist the French colonialists' aggression, but also deal with the direct intervention of the American imperialists. The Vietnamese people have firm confidence in their own strength and in the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh. They are doing their best to prepare for the general counter-offensive, to defeat the French colonialists and American aggressors in one fell swoop, and to win the final victory.

    越南人民抗法战争的成就
    越南  红河  作
    法国殖民者，在美帝国主义支持下，违反了法国和越南人民热爱和平的意志，在越南全境发动侵略战争以来已经整整四年了。一九四五年九月二十三日法国殖民者即已侵占南越，到一九四六年十二月十九日，法军进攻越南首都河内，将侵略战火烧到越南全境。在这四年里，越南人民在胡志明主席英明的领导下，在军事上政治上经济上以及文化上都赢得了伟大的胜利。
    （一）军事方面的胜利
    在军事方面，越南人民连续粉碎了法国的主要侵略计划，并建立了他们自己的军队。
    法国的第一个阴谋计划——一个“闪击战”——企图把越南人民军的主力以及按照他们的估计在最北地区的越南抗战神经中枢一举摧毁。在一九四七年秋季与冬季，法国殖民者这一大规模军事行动遭到了彻底的失败。在这一战役中，法国损失了它的精锐部队大部分。于是越南抵抗法国侵略的战争进入了新阶段——即从防御阶段进到相持阶段。
    法国侵略者在这次失败之后，制订了一个长远计划。他们企图首先“安定”已占区，然后逐渐推进，攻占新据点。一九四八年和一九四九年法国殖民者的第二个阴谋计划又破产了。在这两年中，特别是在一九四九年，越南人民的抗战有了很大的进展。越南人民军的战斗单位和人民地方武装坚持在敌后作战。他们进行武装宣传，组织群众，分化傀儡政权，破坏敌人的交通和经济，使城市中敌人的生命和财产遭受严重损失，消灭敌人的孤立据点，并将“缩小敌占区和把敌人后方变为我们的基地”的口号变为实际行动。在一九四八年年底至一九四九年年初，越南人民军和地方部队占领了数十个敌人的据点，解放了数万平方公里的国土。
    一九四九年底，由于越南人民的成就以及中国人民的伟大胜利，法国殖民者依照勒佛尔（ＲＥＶＥＲＳ）将军的建议，采用了另一个计划：即向美国要求更多的援助，把军队集中在北越，严密封锁中越边境，并固守越南北部。然而最近越南人民军在中越边境和越北中部的胜利却有力地证明法国殖民者的第三个侵略计划又失败了。在一个月中越南人民军彻底粉碎了法国沿着中越边境的整个防御体系，歼灭了九个法国精锐营，解放了七个被法国殖民者占领的城市。法国殖民者在这次挫败之前，从一九四五年九月它发动侵略越南南部那一天到一九四九年底为止，遭到无法补偿的损失，牺牲军队九万多人。那些残存法军的士气日益低下，这是毫无疑问的了。
    在另一方面，越南人民武装已经锻炼得更团结，更坚强，而且有更好的装备了。
    在抗战初期，三分之二的越南正规部队分成小的单位在敌后活动，展开游击战。后来数个小的战斗单位组成一个团，攻击敌人运输队和敌人的孤立据点。后来，再进一步，两三个团能够集中在一起，完成一个战斗。而现在人民军可以在广阔的战线上集中更大的实力作战了。最近中越边境地带法国防线上的作战情况就是证明。
    在正规部队之外，全越人民的地方游击部队又供给人民军以不竭的后备人力及物资，从乡村到城市，从解放区到法国控制区，广泛地展开着游击队的活动，困扰并摧毁敌军。下面一些例子足以证明游击队在抵抗侵略的战争中所作的重要贡献。越南北部第三联区的游击队在十个月里共作战三千三百六十一次，毙敌六千零二十三名，另俘敌三千九百六十二名，击毁与破坏敌人野炮一门、迫击炮两门、飞机一架、军舰六艘、机车十七辆、两栖战车五辆、卡车一百三十九辆、吉普车七辆、公路一百一十七公里、电线六万五千五百八十公尺。越南人民地方部队是在越南人民不断的支援下壮大起来的。一九五○年前四个月中，越南中部清化省人民就捐献了二千万越币充作地方部队基金。一九四九年年底，河静省人民在战争中为了支援人民地方部队捐献了三亿越币。在军事技术方面，越南人民军的指战员也已获得了很大的进步。在抗战初期一些小规模的进攻中，他们所使用的只是破旧的步枪以至于刀子和竹矛，而现在他们已学会了运用重武器，并可以进行规模比较大的运动战。越南总司令部则对全国性的军事行动也已能够指挥裕如，并操胜算了。越南的战士们除了学习在战场上所取得的教训，还在战斗的余隙中，不断地研究其他国家的战斗经验，特别是中国的战斗经验。
    越南工业生产落后，技术干部缺乏，而法国又厉行封锁，但在这种种困难的条件下，越南能够训练医药干部，制造军用药品并已有了巨大的成就。在越南人民许多建设成就中，最可注意的便是他们建立了军事工业。他们使用了旧的机器、原始的工具以及从已破坏的城市中收集起来的破碎金属，不但能够制造来福枪，而且也能制造火箭炮和迫击炮等武器。
    （二）政治方面的胜利
    在政治方面，越南人民密切地团结在民族统一阵线（越联）之内，热烈地支持以胡志明为首的民主政府，粉碎了法国殖民者一切“分而治之”的狡计。越南的工人、农民、青年、妇女分别团结在他们的组织里，在抗战中都尽了最大的努力。他们竭尽全力帮助政府，帮助军队准备总反攻。民族统一阵线依靠工人阶级和农民的坚固联盟，并包括各阶层、各党派和不同宗教信仰的人士在内，正如胡志明主席所指出的，它已成为人民的“钢墙”。
    法国人企图在少数民族中建立“自治邦”以分割越南的阴谋已经失败了。一九四八年年底，越南民主政府颁布了消灭傀儡政权的命令，此后，在乡村建立的傀儡政权机构百分之九十五已经瓦解了。傀儡中央政权经常处于令人可笑的情况。它不断地改头换面，可是换来换去，依然是一撮劣迹昭彰的越奸分子。
    在另一方面，越南民主政府的力量，随着抗战的胜利日益发展了。乡和省的人民委员会在战争中举行了新的选举，使更多的工人和农民参与人民政权的管理工作。人民踊跃地参加选举，即住在敌占区的越南人民也同样热烈地参加投票。在法国占领的土伦城中，百分之九十的居民不顾敌人的凶残迫害，投票选举人民委员会。由于从工人、农民和战斗模范中选出来的代表的参加，人民政权在各方面都大为加强了。
    越南共和国政府对老挝与柬埔寨人民的正义斗争，予以兄弟般平等的援助。老挝与柬埔寨的民族解放战争，因而有了很大的发展。老挝已有了抗战政府，柬埔寨已有了民族解放委员会，这两个国家都建立了民族统一战线，人民解放军和地方武装，并已解放了广大的国土。
    在国际意义上，中国人民的胜利已结束了越南的孤立情况，使越南能够和民主世界密切联系。苏联、中华人民共和国和东欧各人民民主国家对越南的承认，可说是“越南历史上最伟大的胜利”。越南已经成为壮大的世界民主阵营里重要的一员；越南得到了全世界进步人类和法国人民的支持；法国人民正在从事战斗，反对在越南的殖民战争，反对美国的奴役政策。
    （三）经济方面的胜利
    在经济方面，越南人民一方面破坏并封锁敌人的经济，一方面则巩固了他们自己的战时经济，这是建立在人民民主经济基础上的。
    越南南部的橡胶生产为法国殖民者在印度支那获取利润的主要来源，现在已因越南工人的罢工、怠工和有计划性的破坏而遭受了严重的损失。三年来，占地一万七千公顷的七百万株橡树已被毁坏。在煤矿区和几个港口的仓库以及其他设备均因罢工而蒙受很大的损失。例如两年来法国殖民者在土伦港的损失即已超过一千三百万庇阿斯（按为法殖民者在越发行的纸币）并损失许多卡车。在鸿基煤矿区，从一九五○年一月至三月由于罢工、怠工和有计划破坏的结果共损失九千九百二十四万五千八百二十五庇阿斯。与此同时，人民游击队在河内破坏了十九辆电车，二十二架飞机和七个变压器。由于越南人民的封锁，美国和法国输入的货物在法国占领的城市里堆积如山，无法销售。
    由于政治和军事上的失败，法国殖民者采取各种罪恶的暴行，如破坏堤坝、毁坏农作物、烧毁商店、屠杀性畜、占领产米区并封锁越南人民的基地等。法国殖民者尽力企图饿死越南人民，但是这种阴谋也是不得逞的。越南人民武装为了保护农民的谷物，在击退法国掠夺者以后，同时展开了增产竞赛运动。一九四五年法国统治时有二百万人民因饥饿而死亡，自从民主政府建立以来，法殖民者虽然罪恶地破坏堤坝、农作物和牲畜，然而饥馑却不再有了。
    过去四年的战争期间，越南的恢复与重建工作依然是首要工作。在政府和私人资本的密切合作下，按照人民民主路线建立了自给自足经济。政府大力地鼓励并帮助消费及生产合作社和手工业。医院的设备、药品和外科用具在以前完全依靠输入，目前在解放区已有一部分自行生产了。棉花的增产与纺织手工业的发展，解决了大部分地区人民所需要的衣服问题。
    （四）财政金融方面的胜利
    越南民主共和国在财政方面的成就是巨大的。一九四五年法国殖民者留下了巨额的公债，造成最严重的通货膨胀现象。越南为了抗战，不得不支付巨大的国防用费。而且过去法国殖民者依为主要税源的“人头税”（按无论是越南人或华侨，凡十八岁以上的，每年都要缴出一笔很大的人身税。）、酒精、食盐和鸦片专卖税等都取销了。在这样的困难情况下，越南民主共和国依然取得了不少财政上的成绩，这主要是依靠全部越南人民的积极支援。在解放区里一般生活费用比较敌占区要低。一九四八年七月间，越南共和国政府公务人员的薪金普遍提高了百分之二十至三十。
    在国家金融方面，自从解放区禁用法国货币之后，一九四六年二月越南民主政府发行了国家通货“胡志明币”，在一九四八年又决定发行含纯金○·三七五公分的越南金本位的硬币。现在越南民主共和国的货币畅流全国无阻，就是在某些法国殖民者占领地区也不能不承认它。
    总之，在过去四年中，越南人民业已胜利地建立起从帝国主义者的桎梏下解放出来的稳固的国家财政。
    （五）农业方面的胜利
    在农业方面，越南全体人民全面地和热烈地把“不荒一寸土，不闲一只手”的口号实现了。越南人民开垦了许多土地，修复了许多旧堤坝，并且不顾法国的残酷侵袭和有系统的破坏，建立起许多新的堤坝。例如耕地面积在越南北部增加了三十七万一千公顷，在中越北部的四个省增加了二十八万公顷。四年来，在筑堤工作上共用六百三十万立方公尺的泥土、九百万个工作日和六千七百万越币的开支。过去越南人民所经常遭受的饥荒和洪水的灾害，由于四年的努力，已经可以避免了。为了解决一些地区食米的缺乏，越南人民正在大量种植玉蜀黍、红薯等。在一九五○年，这些粗粮的产量较战前增加了数倍。
    （六）社会事业方面的胜利
    在社会事业方面，越南人民民主政府采取适当的步骤去改进工人和农民的物质生活。休耕地以及属于法国殖民者和越奸的土地都分给农民，同时这些农民们进一步的得到民主政府的贷款，仅一九四九年即达三千零六十六万八千一百六十七元越币。越南民主政府允许减少地租百分之二十五或再多一些，合作社网已建立起来，一九四九年仅在第十区即建立了六百个各种合作社。
    为了确保工人的权益，一九四八年三月制订了劳工法。法令规定了工人的利益和参加企业管理。家属可取得津贴，“同工同酬”的原则也广泛实行了。基本工资系依照生活必需品的定量而固定下来。工会保证工人充分运用他们的权利。
    四年来民主政府采取了各种步骤改变了越南人民生活的面貌，如：发展卫生事业的“新生活”运动、严禁销售鸦片、限制出售酒精、禁止卖淫和赌博等。在解放区的极大部分地区，行乞、偷盗和抢劫，可以说已经绝迹了。
    （七）文化方面的胜利
    越南民主共和国在文化方面的成就，可说是最伟大的最出人意料的。在过去短短的四年内，经过消除文盲的竞赛，识字的人平均为百分之八十五。剩下的不识字的人包括住在法占区的人们、老年人和在边区的少数民族。至一九四九年，一千一百五十八万个不识字的人重新打开了他们的眼睛。有十个省份的全部人口，包括工人和青年在内，以及百分之九十九的战士都能读书写字了。为了扩大这些伟大的成就，越南共和国政府制订了如何更进一步教育这些能读会写的人的具体计划。许多初级、中级和高等学校已经开办，数万来自工人阶级和农民中的男女学生在学校里学习着。
    其他如音乐、文学、诗歌和绘画等文化部门也都在大众化、科学化、民族化三大基本原则的路线上发展着。文学作家与艺术家们深入民间学习，以建立人民的文化，同时并唤起人民抗战的爱国主义。
    这一些成就都是通过“爱国主义竞赛”方式达成的。“爱国主义竞赛”是每个越南人的全部事业和思想后面的真正动力。为了祖国，为了他们所爱戴的领袖胡志明主席，越南人民在增产、学习、杀敌方面都互相竞赛。
    越南民主共和国四年来一切伟大成就都是在极恶劣的情况下、在全越人民的巨大的牺牲和损失下获致的。越南人民对于他们所获得的这些初步成就，没有感到丝毫的骄傲，他们充分理解到在将来还有大的困难等待他们去克服。他们不仅要抵抗法国殖民者侵略，而且还要对付美帝国主义者的直接干涉。越南人民对他们自己的力量和对胡志明主席的领导有着坚决的信心，他们正在尽力准备总反攻，准备一举击败法国殖民者和美国侵略者，赢得最后的胜利。
