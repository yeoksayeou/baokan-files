    [By Our Staff Reporter] This newspaper reports: The capital's literary and art circles held a rally and demonstration to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang, passing resolutions to send letters of respect to Chairman Mao and Premier Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The letter to Chairman Mao stated: "To safeguard world peace, we will use all forms of art and literature to promote internationalism and patriotism, to publicize the strength of the world's peace-loving people, to expose the crimes of imperialist aggressors, and to publicize the inevitable defeat of imperialism. We use today's demonstration to express our determination, we will not only use literature and art to strike at imperialist aggressors, but are also ready to use all practical actions to strike at the aggressors when necessary."
    The letter to General Kim Il-sung stated: "The liberation of Pyongyang is not only a victory for the Korean people, but also a victory for the peace-loving people of the world. This victory has increased the confidence of the people of the world in peace. Your heroic struggle against American imperialism is at the forefront of defending world peace. We, the literary and art workers of the Chinese capital, will, like the entire Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, support you with all our strength to defeat our common enemy—the American imperialist aggressors—and defend lasting world peace."
