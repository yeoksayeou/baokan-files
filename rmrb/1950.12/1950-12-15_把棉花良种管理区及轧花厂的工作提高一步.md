The National Cotton Production Work Conference in August this year determined that the breeding and ginning of improved varieties should be handled by specialized institutions, and that the on-site breeding and promotion method should be adopted for the promotion of improved varieties. Subsequently, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government issued a business plan for improved variety cotton ginning factories to focus on ginning improved varieties, as well as cotton seed appraisal methods, and a system for establishing seed adjustment that must first be approved by higher authorities. Recently, the system for selecting, breeding, propagating, and promoting cotton seeds was promulgated, stipulating that the management areas for improved varieties should be rectified and upgraded to breeding areas for improved varieties. All these measures will gradually put the breeding and promotion of improved varieties on the right track. As various places are carrying out the ginning of improved varieties and adjusting the management areas for improved varieties and formulating promotion plans, it will be helpful for various places to review the work of cotton ginning factories and improved variety management areas over the past year.

I. This year, thanks to the attention of leaders at all levels and the efforts of agricultural cadres in various places, the improved variety management areas have generally achieved centralized promotion of improved varieties and have been supported by the masses. This method of concentrated breeding by specially contracted farmers is successful in the current situation of China's small-scale, decentralized economy and the ease with which cotton can hybridize and mutate. However, due to the lack of specific and clear guidelines and tasks for the improved variety management areas over the past year, and the impatient mood in the work of popularizing improved varieties, the following problems have also occurred: (1) There is a lack of understanding of the quality of the original varieties of cotton grown by the masses in the promotion areas, and there is no real certainty in introducing improved varieties, so that the improved varieties promoted in some areas are of poor quality and are not welcomed by the masses. (2) Some improved variety management areas are too large, some are too small, and some are too scattered, making it inconvenient for management and seed collection. Moreover, due to the large amount of seed collected, it is more difficult to avoid mixing good and bad seeds. (3) The long-term role of the improved variety management area is not clear. It is considered that the improved variety management area is temporary and that there is no need for its existence after the improved variety is popularized.

II. The standards for evaluating excellent varieties (first, high yield and good ginning percentage, and second, good quality) are not clear. Not enough in-depth work has been done to strengthen cultivation and improve the yield of improved varieties. Therefore, in many areas, the quality of improved variety management areas is judged only by purity and length of lint, while ignoring yield and ginning percentage. In work, efforts are only made on how to maintain purity, such as centralized promotion, no mixing of seeds, separate harvesting and ginning, etc. (of course, it is not said that these should not be noted), and little attention is paid to strengthening cultivation and research on the changes in variety conditions over the years. The main reason why the promotion of "Si Zi No. 4" cotton in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi was so fast and was able to win the support of the masses was that "Si Zi" cotton had a yield of 30% to 60% higher than the original varieties, and the water conservancy projects were well done. Irrigation with canal water and the promotion of "Si Zi" cotton were carried out at the same time, resulting in a much higher yield of "Si Zi" cotton than native cotton. In the Yangtze River basin, American cotton is not mature enough early, has more diseases and insect pests, and its yield is not stable. The masses do not welcome planting American cotton very much, but want to retain Chinese cotton. These all illustrate the importance of paying attention to cultivation to improve the yield per unit area and promoting improved varieties. However, we have not paid much attention to this in the improved variety management area.

III. In terms of technical guidance, there is a simple reliance on higher levels or farms, and a lack of using the mass line to summarize the experience of the broad masses in achieving bumper harvests, and then using it to guide the masses, thus showing a lack of content in guidance. The Northeast is expected to promote high-ridge deep plowing cultivation techniques next year, which were learned from model cotton growers. These experiences can be absorbed by various places.

IV. The construction of improved variety cotton ginning factories has basically met the needs of the improved variety management areas. In the improved variety management areas where power-driven ginning factories have not been set up, public and private power-driven ginning factories have also been specially contracted or mass-powered ginning machines have been organized. Under the principle of purchasing seed cotton as the main focus in this year's purchase of improved varieties, most of the ginning factories in various districts have started work. However, in the construction of ginning factories over the past year, due to the excessive eagerness to popularize improved varieties, only the number of ginning factories to match the improved variety management areas has been sought, and the necessary equipment has not been paid attention to, especially the construction of warehouses has been very small, so that seed cotton and cotton seeds are piled up in the yards, resulting in mold. In addition, it is right to determine the enterprise management of ginning factories, but some places have given ginning factories too many management tasks, such as not giving cotton production institutions funds, but relying on the ginning factory's profits to solve the problem. This has led to a purely business-oriented viewpoint and the idea of making profits for ginning, thus neglecting the main task of ginning and preserving seeds. Some also want to engage in large-scale rice milling, oil pressing, and power generation, resulting in large staff and making ginning operations a huge burden in various places. Many cadres of the ginning factories in the improved variety management areas, except for the work of distributing cotton seeds in the spring, are all busy with building factories and collecting cotton, which greatly weakens technical guidance and research. Even more factories have not been built well and cannot start work, and many improved variety seed cottons have been collected but there is no place to store them, and other ginning factories are not allowed to gin them, resulting in mold and losses of seed cotton.

In order to effectively do a good job in cotton seed work, so as to achieve the goal of increasing yield and improving quality, the improved variety management areas should be rectified. The task of the improved variety breeding area should be relatively long-term, and the breeding area should also serve as a demonstration and promotion area, becoming the central base for popularizing improved varieties and constantly updating improved varieties in the main cotton-growing areas. Every year, concentrated breeding of improved varieties should pay attention to improving cultivation techniques, as a demonstration of bumper harvests of improved varieties. Strictly carry out seed selection, separate ginning, and maintain improved varieties, so as to supply the needs of district promotion and seed collection. In the process of promoting a certain improved variety in the breeding area, before a better variety is used for replacement, the masses should mainly select and retain their own seeds. The establishment of the breeding area is stipulated in the recently promulgated cotton seed selection, breeding, propagation and promotion system by the Central Government. It stipulates that the area should be based on the special area, and every 200,000 to 1 million mu of cotton fields should concentrate 10,000 to 50,000 mu of cotton fields in areas with better natural conditions to establish a breeding area. The local government and professional institutions will mobilize and organize the broad masses to maintain and improve the excellent yield of cotton seeds. The improved varieties bred in the breeding area will be promoted by the local government to general areas. According to this year's situation, the improved variety cotton ginning factory should focus on strengthening the equipment of the existing factory next year. Its task is clearly stipulated in the operating plan issued by the Central Government that it should focus on the ginning of improved varieties, and it should be set up to ensure that the enterprise breaks even and according to the needs of the breeding area. In the future, the main standard for checking the work of ginning factories and breeding areas should be the quality of the seeds produced, the amount of benefits obtained by the masses, and whether they have won the support of the masses. This will enable our breeding area and ginning factory to maintain and improve improved varieties. Here are some suggestions:

I. The breeding area and ginning factory should formulate a production plan at the beginning of each year based on the tasks stipulated in the promotion and breeding system and the local government's cotton production plan. The content includes the increase in yield per unit area, the improvement of certain cultivation, the improvement of cotton seeds and quality, the promotion area of the seeds produced, and the operation of the ginning factory, so that the cotton seed breeding and promotion can be put on the right track of planned production.

II. Every year, observe and record the changes in the growth of cotton in the breeding area's farmland, the improvement of cultivation, and the quality of fiber and seeds in cotton collection, and the masses' response to seeds, and conduct comparative research for years to find out the reasons for the improvement or degradation of cotton seeds, in order to improve seeds. More importantly, they should be familiar with the cotton seed conditions in the zoning and variety replacement areas under the jurisdiction of the breeding area, so as to facilitate the replacement of cotton seeds.

III. The breeding area should become a model area for high cotton yield and good quality. In addition to seed selection, variety replacement, and strengthening cultivation, it should summarize the typical households and villages with high yields among the masses this winter and next spring, as well as simple and easy-to-implement cultivation techniques that can win the support of the local masses, and promote them, and launch a mass technical improvement and high-yield competition movement next year.

IV. In the work of improving cotton seeds, in addition to general leadership, agricultural departments at all levels can help certain ginning factories and breeding areas establish models and typical examples of producing improved varieties to promote general cotton farmers. At the same time, each ginning factory and breeding area, and even every cotton production worker, should also grasp some typical villages and households and establish typical examples of high yields for demonstration.

In short, the basic task of cotton seed improvement is to increase yield and improve quality, and increasing yield is more important. In addition to the experimental fields and breeding farms selecting and breeding excellent varieties suitable for the cultivation conditions of various places, the seeds bred by the improved variety breeding area and the seeds ginned by the improved variety ginning factory are directly promoted to the broad masses of farmers. The quality of the seeds is directly related to the vital interests of the farmers, and this work must be attached importance to. Cotton seed breeding, acquisition, and promotion is a series of meticulous organizational work, not just technical work. The cultivation of cotton seeds should not only be concentrated on breeding, separate harvesting and ginning to avoid hybridization and confusion, but also pay attention to strengthening cultivation to achieve the superior yield of improved varieties, otherwise it will quickly deteriorate. At present, various places are carrying out cotton collection and seed preservation, and appraisal work should be done well, so that the seeds issued next year will be universally better than the original varieties and welcomed by the masses. At the same time, under the leadership of governments at all levels and the efforts of all staff, many models of producing improved varieties and popularizing improved varieties will surely emerge in the breeding area and ginning factory next year.

    把棉花良种管理区及轧花厂的工作提高一步
    臧成耀
    今年八月全国棉产工作会议，曾确定良种的繁殖与收轧应由专业机构办理，良种推广采用就地繁殖就地推广的方针。嗣后中央农业部又发布了良种轧花厂以收轧良种为主的经营方案，以及棉种鉴定办法，和建立调剂种子应先由上级批准的制度。最近又颁发了棉种选育繁殖推广制度，规定良种管理区要加以整顿，提高为良种繁殖区。所有这些措施，将使良种繁殖和推广工作，逐步走上正轨。当各地正进行良种的收轧，和调整良种管理区与制定推广计划之际，来检查一下轧花厂及良种管理区一年来的工作，对各地将有一定的帮助。
    一、今年的良种管理区，由于各级领导的重视及各地农业干部的努力，一般作到了良种的集中推广，并得到群众的拥护。这种特约农户集中繁殖的方式，在目前我国小农分散经济及棉花容易杂交变异的情况下是成功的。但一年来由于良管区的方针任务不够具体明确，普及良种工作中存在急躁情绪，因而也发生了下列问题：（１）对推广区群众的原有品种好坏不太了解，引入良种无确实把握，以致有些地区推广的良种不良，群众不欢迎。（２）有的良种管理区太大，有的太小，太分散，不便管理和收种。又由于收种太多，更难避免良莠混杂。（３）对良管区长期的作用不明确，认为良管区是暂时的，良种普及后即无存在的必要。
    二、对评定优良品种的标准（首先是产量高，衣分好，其次是品质好）不明确。对于加强耕作栽培，提高良种产量的工作做得不够深入，因而不少地区检查良管区的好坏，只知以纯杂及绒长来衡量，而忽略产量及衣分。在工作上，只做到如何保纯，如集中推广，种子不混杂，分收分轧等（当然不是说不应注意这些），而不大注意加强耕作栽培及历年品种情况变化的研究。陕西关中区推广斯字四号很快，并能得到群众拥护的主要原因，是因为斯字棉比原来品种产量高百分之三十至六十，再加以水利工程做得好，渠水灌溉与斯字棉同时推广，致使斯字棉的产量比土棉高得多。在长江流域，美棉成熟不够早，病虫害较多，产量也不稳定，群众并不太欢迎种美棉，而要保留着中棉，这些均说明了注意耕作栽培提高单位面积产量与推广良种的重要关系，但我们对此并未在良管区很好的注意研究。
    三、在技术指导上有单纯仰赖上级或农场，缺乏用群众路线去总结广大群众丰收的经验，再去指导群众，因而表现了指导内容贫乏。东北预计明年推广高垅深耕的栽培技术，就是从植棉劳模那里学来的。这些经验各地可以吸取。
    四、良种轧花厂的建设，基本上配合了良管区的需要。未设动力轧花厂的良管区，也特约了公私营动力轧花厂或组织了群众的人力轧花车。在今年收购良种以收购籽棉为主的方针下，各区轧花厂大部均已开工。但在一年来轧花厂的建设上，由于存在普及良种过于性急，只求数量上的配合良管区，而未注意到必要的设备，特别是仓库建设的很少，以致籽棉、棉籽堆集在院里，而有霉坏情况。另外确定轧花厂的企业经营是对的，但有的地方给予轧花厂经营的任务太大，如不给棉产机构以经费，而由轧花厂盈利解决。产生了单纯经营观点，为轧花而轧花的盈利思想，因而忽略了轧花保种的主要任务。还有的想大搞碾米榨油发电等副业，因而编制庞大，使轧花经营成了各地的极大负担。许多良管区轧花厂的干部，除春天作了发棉籽的工作外，全为了建厂及收花而忙碌，大大减弱了技术的指导与研究，更有的厂子没有建设好不能开工，收了许多良种籽棉又无处保藏，也不让别的轧花厂去轧，而使籽棉发霉，造成损失的现象。
    为了切实作好棉种工作，以达提高产量改进品质的目的，良种管理区应加以整顿。良种繁殖区的任务应是比较长期的，繁殖区并应兼作示范和推广，成为主要棉区普及良种和不断更新良种的中心基地。每年集中繁殖良种，应注意耕作栽培技术的提高，作为良种丰收的示范。严格进行选种分轧和保持良种，以供分区推广采种之需。繁殖区在推广一定的良种过程中，没有更优良品种换种前，以群众自选自留种为主，繁殖区的设置在中央最近颁布之棉种选育繁殖推广制度上，规定以专区为单位，每二十万至一百万亩棉田，以自然条件较好之地区，集中一万至五万亩棉田设立繁殖区，由专业机构及当地政府发动组织广大群众保持与提高棉种的优异丰产，繁殖区繁殖的良种由当地政府推广至一般普通区。良种轧花厂，根据今年的情况，明年应以加强现有厂的设备为主，其任务在中央发布之经营方案上，已明确规定以收轧良种为主，作到企业保本并根据繁殖区之需要而设立。今后检查轧花厂繁殖区工作的好坏，应以所产种籽的好坏，群众得到利益大小及是否获得群众拥护为主要标准。这样就将使我们的繁殖区轧花厂保持与改进良种。这里特提出如下建议：
    一、繁殖区轧花厂应该依据推广繁殖制度规定的任务及当地政府的棉产计划，在每年的开始订出生产计划，其内容包括单位面积产量的增加，一定耕作栽培的改进，棉种及品质的提高，所产种籽的推广地区及轧花厂的经营等，使棉种繁殖推广走上正规的有计划的生产。
    二、每年观察与记载繁殖区农田内棉花的生育变化，耕作栽培的改进，及收花中之纤维、种籽的品质，群众对种籽的反映等，连年进行比较研究，找出棉种提高或退化的原因，以改进种籽，更应熟习繁殖区所管辖之分区换种区的棉花种籽的情况，以便于更换棉种。
    三、繁殖区要成为棉花产量高、质量好的模范区。在工作上除选种、换种及加强耕作栽培外，应于今冬、明春总结群众中间产量高的村户典型，及简而易行能获得当地群众拥护的栽培技术，加以推广，明年开展一个群众性的技术改良与丰产竞赛运动。
    四、在棉种改进工作中，除一般的领导外，各级农业部门可帮助一定的轧花厂繁殖区树立生产良种的模范和典型，以推动一般棉户。同时，各轧花厂繁殖区以至每个棉产工作人员，亦要抓住一些典型村户，树立产量高的典型，以资示范。
    总之，棉种改良的基本任务，是提高产量与改进品质，而产量提高更为重要，除试验场、繁殖场选育繁殖适合各地耕作条件的优良品种外，良种繁殖区繁殖的种籽，良种轧花厂轧出的种籽是直接推广于广大农民的，种籽的好坏直接关系到农民的切身利益，必须重视这一个工作。棉种的繁殖收购与推广，是一系列的细密的组织工作，并非单纯的技术工作。棉种的培养，不仅应集中繁殖，分收分轧，避免杂交混乱，更应注意加强耕作栽培，以达到良种的优性丰产，否则仍会很快的变坏。目前各地正在进行收花保种，应作好鉴定工作，使明年发出的种籽，普遍比原有的品种好，而受到群众的欢迎。同时，繁殖区轧花厂在各级政府的领导及全体工作人员的努力下，明年定将出现许多生产良种与普及良种的模范。
