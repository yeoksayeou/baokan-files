    Cotton Textile Industry Moves from Recovery to Development
    National Cotton Textile Conference Decides on Next Year's Production Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 8th] After moving from struggling to maintain to full recovery in 1950, China's cotton textile industry has now begun to embark on a new stage of development. The Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government convened the National Cotton Textile Conference from November 22nd to December 3rd. Based on the bumper cotton harvest this year and the general increase in purchasing power of the people nationwide, and in order to correct the shortcomings of the past year's work, the conference decided that the guiding principle for the cotton textile industry in 1951 is: "Increase production, improve management, focus on key construction, and develop steadily." According to the preliminary production plan for the national cotton textile industry determined by the conference for 1951, the national production of cotton yarn and cloth next year will exceed the highest pre-war annual output by 28%. Based on the actual output from January to October 1950 and the planned output for November and December, the conference estimates that the national cotton textile industry's production of yarn and cloth this year will reach 97% of the highest pre-war year, exceeding 1936 by 14%. The conference has specifically allocated the production figures to be undertaken by state-owned and private cotton textile factories in major administrative regions and their respective provinces and cities for next year. It was determined that, nationwide, all state-owned and private cotton textile factories will operate six days and six nights; in cotton-producing areas and regions with suitable conditions, a three-shift system will be trialed and gradually promoted.

    The conference also revised and supplemented the yarn and cloth management standards formulated at the March conference this year, as a direction for the management of cotton textile factories nationwide.

    The conference discussed the production responsibility system and reward and punishment system. Everyone agreed that, whether in state-owned or private factories, a series of level-by-level responsibility systems must be established from the factory director to the workers, to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the past. At the same time, both state-owned and private factories should implement a reward and punishment system, based on the principles of emphasizing rewards, combining education and punishment, and attaching equal importance to spiritual encouragement and material rewards. The masses should be mobilized to implement rewards and punishments, so that the individual interests of employees are combined with social interests, overcoming the phenomenon of unclear rewards and punishments in the past. In addition, the conference extensively exchanged views on collective contracts, wage issues, and work payment issues.

    In order to encourage state-owned and private cotton textile factories nationwide to ensure quality, increase output, reduce costs, and reduce accidents, the Central Ministry of Textile Industry has specially made three banners of first, second, and third class awards, which will be awarded to the best-performing state-owned and private factories at the end of 1951.

    The conference was attended by a total of 278 representatives from various aspects of public, private, administrative, and trade union sectors from major administrative regions nationwide, as well as representatives from relevant agencies in Beijing. At the conference, all the representatives unanimously passed a letter to report the achievements of the conference to Chairman Mao, support the principle of unified purchase and sale of yarn and cloth, and guarantee the completion of next year's production plan. All the representatives also expressed that they will do their utmost to complete the production plan to participate in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country.

    棉纺织工业从恢复走向发展
    全国棉纺织会议决定明年生产计划
    【新华社八日讯】中国棉纺织工业经过了一九五零年内从勉力维持到全面恢复，现已开始走上新的发展阶段。中央人民政府纺织工业部在十一月二十二日至十二月三日之间召开的全国棉纺织会议，根据今年棉产丰收和全国人民购买力普遍提高的情况，并为了改正过去一年内工作的缺点，决定了一九五一年棉纺织工业的方针是：“提高生产，改进管理，重点建设，稳步发展”。按照会议初步确定的一九五一年全国棉纺织工业的生产计划，明年全国所生产的棉纱和布匹，将比战前最高年产量还超过百分之二十八。会议根据一九五零年一月至十月的实际产量和十一、十二两月的计划产量，估计今年全国棉纺织工业所生产的纱布，将达战前产量最高一年的百分之九十七，比一九三六年则将超过百分之十四。会议已具体分配了各大行政区及其所属各省市公私营棉纺织厂明年所要担负的生产数字。确定今后在全国范围内，公私营棉纺织工厂一律开工六天六夜；在产棉区及有条件的地区，试行三班制，并逐步加以推广。
    会议又修正与补充了今年三月会议所制订的纱布经营标准，作为全国棉纺织工厂经营管理的努力方向。
    会议讨论了生产责任制及奖惩制度。大家认为：无论公私营厂，必须建立从厂长到工人的一系列的按级负责制度，克服过去无人负责的现象。同时，不论公私营厂都要实行奖惩制度，以奖励为主、教育和处分相结合、精神鼓励和物质奖励并重的原则，发动群众来实行奖惩，使职工个人利益和社会利益结合起来，克服过去奖罚不明的现象。此外，会议对集体合同、工资问题、工缴问题都广泛地交换了意见。
    中央纺织工业部为鼓励全国公私营棉纺织工厂保证质量、提高产量、减低成本、减少事故，特制就了甲乙丙三等奖旗三面，准备于一九五一年年终，奖给成绩最好的公私营工厂。
    出席这次会议的包括全国各大行政区公、私、行政、工会等各方面代表及北京有关机关代表共二百七十八人。在大会上，全体代表一致通过写信向毛主席报告会议成就，拥护纱布统一购销原则和保证明年生产计划的完成。全体代表并表示将以全力完成生产计划，来参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
