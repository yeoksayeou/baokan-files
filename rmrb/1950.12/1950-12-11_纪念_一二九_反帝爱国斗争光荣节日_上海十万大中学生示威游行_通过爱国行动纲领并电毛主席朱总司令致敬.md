(Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 10th) Shanghai's universities and middle schools, numbering approximately 100,000 students, held a demonstration parade on the 9th to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the nation, commemorating the glorious "December 9th" anti-imperialist patriotic movement.

    On the vast meeting ground, a sea of red flags rippled. Students held high the national flags of China and Korea, as well as giant portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and General Kim Il-sung. They also raised models of airplanes, tanks, and warships, symbolizing the construction of a strong national defense, along with pledges expressing their determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the nation. Many white-haired old professors also joined the ranks of the youth. At the meeting, Xie Bangding, chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, who came to Shanghai to participate in the conference, expressed warm congratulations to the conference and expressed the hope that Shanghai students would further promote the traditional spirit of patriotism and strive to defend and build the motherland. Lu Guang, deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, called on students throughout the city to unite closely and transform their patriotic enthusiasm into practical action. Professor Wang Zhong of Fudan University, who participated in the "December 9th" movement, reported to the conference the heroic struggle of the students at that time under the suppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries' broadswords and water dragons. He then said: "Students, today our motherland is more lovely, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the students is even higher. Today, the students no longer rely solely on bare hands to fight as we did in those days. Today, the motherland has specially established schools for everyone to learn military skills. This is the glory and happiness of the young generation of New China!"

    The conference was followed by student representatives from Nanjing Ginling Women's College and St. John's University denouncing the crimes of American imperialism in spreading cultural aggression toxins in China and severely condemning Austin's shameless slander of the Chinese people. In great anger, the students present unanimously adopted the Shanghai Student Patriotic Action Program, and under the leadership of the presidium, all the students swore an oath: We are willing to do everything in our power to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and to fight for the security of the motherland, for world peace, and for the bright future of the young generation. Many students enthusiastically signed up to join military cadre schools on the spot. The conference unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The telegram stated: We report to you with boiling hearts that today the motherland calls on us to participate in various military cadre schools, and we are responding enthusiastically with great excitement. We vow to inherit the glorious tradition of the "December 9th" student patriotic movement and, under your wise leadership, continue to struggle unremittingly to defend the motherland, stop aggressive wars, strive for lasting world peace, and strive for a bright future. Then, the parade began. The students from various schools who had signed up to participate in military cadre schools marched at the forefront of the procession, each wearing a big red flower on their chest. Hundreds of thousands of citizens along the way welcomed the ranks of this young generation with firecrackers and laughter.
