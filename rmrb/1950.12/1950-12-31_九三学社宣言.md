    Nine-Three Society Declaration
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Nine-Three Society issued a declaration on the 30th protesting against the British imperialists' persecution of overseas Chinese in Malaya. The full text is as follows:
    In recent years, our compatriots in Malaya have been continuously subjected to unwarranted persecution by the British colonial authorities. The methods include massacre, arson, imprisonment, and expulsion. Our 2.8 million compatriots in Malaya are in a precarious state at all times, and their lives and property have suffered serious losses. We cannot sit idly by and ignore such insane and shameless atrocities by British imperialism. We must condemn these atrocities before the people of the world who love peace and respect humanity, and lodge a serious protest with British imperialism!
    The prosperity of Malaya today is inseparable from the hard work of the overseas Chinese in Malaya. The British colonial authorities cannot but publicly acknowledge the contributions of the overseas Chinese to Malayan production and construction, as well as their heroic struggle in the Anti-Japanese War. However, the reward of British imperialism to the overseas Chinese is inhuman massacre and persecution. This is because the British colonial authorities have encountered a shameful defeat in their bloody war to massacre the people of Malaya. British imperialism is carrying out large-scale persecution of our compatriots residing there, thinking that this can extinguish the national liberation movement of the Malayan people, and cooperate with American imperialism's aggression in Korea to intensify the enslavement and control of the Asian people. But the facts are bound to be contrary to the wishes of imperialism. This policy of hostility to the people will only accelerate the death of imperialism.
    We firmly support the solemn statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government regarding the persecution of overseas Chinese in Malaya by British imperialism. We, together with all the Chinese people, must take concrete actions to support the 2.8 million overseas Chinese in Malaya and oppose the bloody atrocities of British imperialism.

专栏：抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨

    九三学社宣言
    【本报讯】九三学社三十日发表抗议英帝国主义迫害马来亚华侨宣言，全文如下：
    近年以来，我们在马来亚的侨胞不断遭到英国殖民当局的无理迫害。其手段包括屠杀，焚烧，监禁，驱逐，我二百八十万在马来亚的侨胞随时随地都在岌岌可危的状态中，他们的生命财产已受到严重的损失。我们对于英帝国主义这种疯狂无耻的暴行决不能坐视不顾，我们要在全世界爱好和平尊重人道的人民面前，谴责这种暴行，并向英帝国主义提出严重的抗议！
    马来亚之有今日的繁荣，和华侨在马来亚的辛勤劳动是分不开的。华侨对马来亚生产建设以及在抗日战争中的英勇斗争，即英国殖民当局也不能不公开承认。但英帝国主义对华侨的报答却是惨无人道的虐杀和迫害。这是因为英国殖民当局在其进行屠杀马来亚人民的血腥战争中已遭遇到可耻的失败，英帝国主义对我居留当地的侨胞实行大规模的残害，以为这样可以灭绝马来亚人民的民族解放运动、并配合美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略，加紧对亚洲人民的奴役和统制。但事实必然与帝国主义的愿望相反，这种仇视人民的政策，只有加速帝国主义的死亡。
    我们坚决拥护我中央人民政府外交部对英帝国主义迫害马来亚华侨所发表的严正声明。我们和全中国人民一道，一定要以具体的行动支援马来亚二百八十万侨胞，反对英帝国主义的血腥暴行。
