What should be paid attention to in this year's winter water conservancy project?
Li Pu

    The flood control work of rivers across the country has now ended. The preliminary plans for water conservancy projects in various regions and river basins for the coming year have also been determined. The scale of national water conservancy projects next year will be even more ambitious than this year. In order to reduce the burden of spring repair projects next year and alleviate the conflict between spring repair and spring plowing in terms of time and manpower, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government has issued instructions requiring all regions to carry out some projects in advance during the slack farming season in winter. This is absolutely necessary. According to last year's experience, the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Huai River have all been able to complete one-quarter to one-third of all projects during the winter repairs. This proves that carrying out some projects in winter has a significant effect on ensuring the completion of various flood control projects before the flood season. All regions should accept this experience. Those who have the conditions to carry out winter repairs should actively prepare and carry out as much as possible. If the weather is too cold to carry out projects, they should also complete the preparation of materials and other preparatory work for the spring repairs next year during the winter.

    Regarding the implementation of this year's winter projects, the Ministry of Water Resources' instructions include several key points that should be especially noted:

    First, the projects must be planned. All projects must have specific project plans and be approved by a certain higher level before construction can begin; otherwise, it is not advisable to start construction. This has been proven by countless experiences. First of all, for each region itself, it must have detailed project plans in advance to overcome blindness in engineering and reduce errors or waste during construction. In terms of the construction of national water conservancy projects, the national construction funds must be used according to priorities in order to achieve the greatest effectiveness. Therefore, each region must first submit specific project plans so that the leading organs can compare the actual needs and economic benefits of each project and make correct decisions. Last winter, due to the severity of the disaster in many areas, some areas started construction without reporting plans in order to urgently provide work relief. This had objective difficulties at the time, but it must also be admitted that many shortcomings arose from this. For example, in individual provinces and regions, when convening meetings of responsible persons from various special districts and county governments, the water conservancy funds were distributed to each special district and county for their own disposal. This violated the principle of priority use and thus reduced the due effect of water conservancy projects. Some provinces and regions' levee restoration projects simply blindly repaired the old levees without accurately estimating the flood flow of each river and the benefits of the levee projects, so that during the flood season, they could not propose effective standards to guarantee flood control and often had to do supplementary projects. Some projects in individual areas did a lot of earthwork, but only protected a small amount of land, completely failing to calculate the economic benefits. Some projects were not surveyed in advance, or the design was rough, so the plan was repeatedly changed during construction, resulting in a waste of manpower and resources. These have caused varying degrees of losses to water conservancy construction in the past year. Such blind and hasty phenomena must be resolutely overcome.

    Second, it is necessary to be good at propaganda and mobilization and strengthen organizational leadership. Water management is originally for the benefit of the masses themselves, so the purpose and plan of water conservancy projects must be thoroughly publicized to make them understood by the broad masses. Before construction, the arrangements for the food and accommodation of migrant workers and the division of work sections must be carefully prepared and conscientiously and thoroughly checked. Regarding the standard requirements for the implementation of the project, typical demonstrations must be made. Only when the masses master this standard can the project be done well. Regarding the labor organization problem, there are many good experiences in various places during last winter's repairs and this spring's repairs that are worth promoting, and the Ministry of Water Resources' instructions have also pointed out this. After the administrative organs mobilize, it is a commendable method for the masses to voluntarily organize, give wages according to the amount of work, and implement contracting. For example, during this spring's repairs, the Wuhu Dike Repair Project in southern Anhui improved the average work efficiency by one to two cubic meters because the migrant workers voluntarily organized and paid wages according to the amount of work. There are similar examples in the Yellow River and Hebei Province. Because this voluntary labor organization has neat labor, strict organization, and reasonable division of labor; and payment according to work makes any worker not be affected by others, it is easier to mobilize the enthusiasm of migrant workers than the class platoon organization compiled by the higher authorities. However, when implementing this method, the inspection of project quality must be emphasized to prevent the tendency of simply pursuing quantity. The site management must have detailed plans and deployments to ensure the convenience of construction. The wage unit price is also an important issue. Standard unit prices should be set based on general labor and general work efficiency, so that migrant workers have a certain surplus in addition to eating every day, and then make appropriate increases or decreases according to the difficulty of the specific project. This ensures that migrant workers have food to eat and money to earn and can do more and earn more. The payment of wages must be settled after the work is completed. Last winter and this spring, some areas failed to settle wages after the project was completed, completely losing the role of the work-based wage system and greatly reducing the morale of migrant workers, which should be taken as a lesson.

    In short, the achievements of last winter's repairs and this spring's repairs are great, but due to incomplete plans, insufficient preparation, and unthorough and in-depth organizational leadership, there are also many shortcomings. For this year's winter repair projects, the water conservancy organs and relevant administrative leading organs in various regions must conduct in-depth reviews of the work of last winter and this spring, summarize the experiences and lessons, resolutely overcome shortcomings, correct mistakes, and improve water conservancy work another step!

    今年水利冬修工程应注意什么？
    李朴
    目前全国河流的防汛工作，都已结束。各地区各流域明年度的水利事业计划，也已初步确定。明年全国水利工程的规模，比今年更为宏大。为了减少明年春修工程的负担，减轻春修与春耕在时间上和人力上的矛盾。中央人民政府水利部已发出指示，要求各地利用冬季农闲季节，提前进行一部分工程。这是完全必要的。根据去年的经验，长江、黄河、淮河各大河流，皆能在冬修当中完成全部工程的四分之一至三分之一。可以证明冬季进行一部分工程，对于保证各项防洪工程在汛前完成有很大的作用。各地区应当接受这个经验。凡是有条件进行冬修的，都应积极准备，尽可能进行一部分。天气寒冷不能进行工程的，也要在冬季完成明年春修的备料与其他准备工作。
    关于今年冬工的进行，水利部的指示中有几个要点，都是应该特别注意的：
    第一是工程必须有计划。一切工程，在动工前必须有具体工程计划并须经一定上级审核批准，才可以施工，否则不宜开工。这是无数经验证明了的。首先，就各地区本身来说，必须事前有详密的工程计划，才能克服工程上的盲目性，并减少施工期间的错误或浪费。就全国水利事业的建设来说，国家建设经费必须按重点来使用，才能发生最大的效用，所以各地区必须先送具体工程计划，领导机关才能比较各项工程的实际需要与经济效益，做出正确的决定。去年冬修，由于许多地区灾情严重，为了急于以工代赈，有些地区未报计划，即行施工。这在当时固有客观的困难，但也必须承认，许多缺点即由此而生。比如有个别省区，在召集各专署县政府负责人开会时，即将水利事业费分配各专、县自己去支配，这就违反了重点使用的原则，因之减低了水利工程应有的效果。有些省区的复堤工程，只是盲目地对旧有堤防加以修整，没有精确估计各河的洪水流量和堤防工程的效益，以致到了防汛期间，提不出保证防汛的有效标准，往往补做工程。个别地区的工程，做了大量的土工，但仅保障了少数的土地，完全没有计算到经济效益。有些工程，事先未经测量，或设计粗略，因而到施工时一再改变计划，以致浪费人力物力。这些都曾对过去一年的水利建设造成了程度不同的损失。对于这样盲目草率的现象，必须坚决加以克服。
    第二是必须善于宣传动员与加强组织领导。治水本来是为了群众自己的利益，所以水利工程的目的与计划，必须进行深入的宣传，使之为广大群众所了解。施工以前，关于民工食宿的安排及工段的划分，都要仔细准备并切实地周到地加以检查。关于实施工程的标准要求，则须作典型示范，只有群众掌握了这个标准，工程才能做好。关于劳动组织问题，去年冬修和今年春修，各地有许多好的经验值得推广，水利部指示中也已指出。在行政机关动员之后，由群众自愿组合，按方给资，实行包工，是值得提倡的一种办法。比如今年春修中，皖南芜湖修圩工程，由于民工自愿组合，按方给资，平均工作效率提高一至二公方。黄河和河北省也有类似的例证。因为这种自愿的劳动组织，劳力整齐，组织严密，分工合理；而按劳计酬，使任何工人均不受别人的牵扯，比由上级编定的班排组织，更容易发动民工的积极性。不过实行这个办法，对于工程质量的检查必须重视，以防止单纯追求数量的偏向，工地管理，更要有细密的计划和布署，以保证施工的便利。工资单价也是一个重要的问题，应该根据一般劳动力、一般工作效率订出标准单价，使民工每日除吃以外有一定的剩余，然后根据具体工程的难易，做适当的增减。以保证民工有吃有赚并能多做多得。工资的发放，必须工完账结，去冬和今春，有的地区工程完了不能结算工资，完全失掉计工给资制度的作用，大大降低民工情绪，应该引为教训。
    总之，去年冬修和今年春修工程，成绩是很大的，但是由于计划不周密，准备不充分，组织领导不细致，不深入，也有不少的缺点。今年的冬修工程，各地区水利机关与有关的行政领导机关，一定要对去冬和今春的工作，深入检讨，总结出经验教训，坚决克服缺点，纠正错误，把水利工作再提高一步！
