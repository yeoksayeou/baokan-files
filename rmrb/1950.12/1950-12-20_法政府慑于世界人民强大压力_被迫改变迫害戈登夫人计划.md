Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 17th: According to TASS, under the increasingly strong pressure from people around the world and the French people opposing the persecution of Mrs. Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation and the French Women's Union, the French judicial authorities have been forced to change their plan to hand Mrs. Gordon over to a military tribunal for trial, and have announced that the case will be tried by an ordinary civil court. The French democratic newspapers are hailing this initial victory of the people and calling for strengthening the protest movement to force the reactionary French government to completely stop persecuting Mrs. Gordon.

Mrs. Gordon was prosecuted by the French judicial authorities in late May on the false charge of "undermining morale and attempting to obstruct national defense" for the French Women's Union distributing propaganda posters opposing the massacre of the Vietnamese people. The French reactionaries even wanted to invoke Article 76 of the criminal law, which was customarily used during the German fascist occupation, in the trial; according to this law, the defendant could even be sentenced to death. But as soon as the news of the persecution of Mrs. Gordon spread, people all over the world and the French people launched a massive protest movement, forcing the French reactionaries to abandon their original intention.

    法政府慑于世界人民强大压力
    被迫改变迫害戈登夫人计划
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十七日讯：在全世界人民和法国人民反对迫害国际民主妇联主席和法兰西妇女联盟主席戈登夫人的越来越强大的压力下，法国司法当局已被迫改变其将戈登夫人交军事法庭审讯的计划，而宣布该案由普通民事法庭审理。法国各民主报纸都为人民的这个初步胜利欢呼，并号召加强抗议运动，迫使法国反动政府完全停止迫害戈登夫人。
    戈登夫人是因法兰西妇女联盟散发反对屠杀越南人民的宣传画，而于五月下旬被法国司法当局诬告为犯“败坏士气及企图妨碍国防”罪起诉的。法国反动派甚至还想在审判中援用在德国法西斯占领时期惯用的刑法第七十六条；根据这条法律，被告甚至可以被判处死刑。但迫害戈登夫人的消息一经传出，全世界人民和法国人民就发动了声势浩大的抗议运动，迫使法国反动派不得不打消原意。
