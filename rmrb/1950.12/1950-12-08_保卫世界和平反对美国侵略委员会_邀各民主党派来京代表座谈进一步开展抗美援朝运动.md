    Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression Invites Representatives of Various Democratic Parties in Beijing to Discuss Further Development of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    [This newspaper’s report] The Chinese People’s Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression invited all representatives of various democratic parties attending meetings in Beijing to a tea party on the 5th and 6th to discuss issues related to the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. More than 160 representatives from various democratic parties attended. The座谈会 was presided over by Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong, vice-chairmen of the Committee to Defend Peace and Oppose Aggression. Standing committee members Situ Meitang, Shen Junru, Xing Xiping, Shao Lizi, Ma Xulun, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Xu Baoju, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zemin, Cai Chang, and Luo Longji also attended. Zhang Bojun, our country's representative to the World Peace Congress, also reported on the proceedings of the Second World Peace Congress at the meeting.
    Vice Chairman Peng Zhen spoke first, saying that resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country is a major event for the Chinese people today, and it is the central task of the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression. He expressed hope that everyone would fully exchange opinions in order to further develop the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement across the country.
    Subsequently, representatives of various democratic parties attending the meeting, including Chen Yisheng (Shanghai, China National Democratic Construction Association), Li Zhuchen (Tianjin, China National Democratic Construction Association), Zhang Dongmu (Jinan, China National Democratic Construction Association), Chen Mingshu (Central South, Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), Li Minxin (South China, Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), Xie Renbing (Shanghai, China Association for Promoting Democracy), Yang Ziheng (Northwest, China Democratic League), Wu Zaoxi (Shanghai, Jiusan Society), Chu Tunan (Southwest, China Democratic League), Hu Ziang (Chongqing, China National Democratic Construction Association), Guan Mengjue (Northeast, China Democratic League), Gong Tianmin (Shenyang, China National Democratic Construction Association), Chen Renbing (Shanghai, China Democratic League), Chen Liangzuo (Guangxi, Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), Wang Wenguang (Taiyuan, China Democratic League), Yan Daogang (Hubei, Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), Liang Ruochen (Guangdong, China Democratic League), Chen Junleng (Guangzhou, China National Democratic Construction Association), Xu Shunying (Guangzhou, Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang), and Wu Han (Beijing, China Democratic League), spoke successively, reporting on the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland Movement taking place across the country, and shared the rich experiences of Resist America, Aid Korea work in various regions.
    Many speakers emphasized the increasingly widespread actions of workers, farmers, students, industrialists and businessmen, and people from all walks of life in resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending their homes and country.
    Guan Mengjue and Gong Tianmin from the Northeast stated in their speeches that, due to the painful experience of the Japanese invasion of China and their current lives, the people of the Northeast deeply felt the "lips and teeth" relationship between China and Korea, and recognized that resisting America and aiding Korea was not inviting trouble but extinguishing a fire that was burning close to home; it was not affecting construction, but rather protecting it. The aggressive actions of American imperialism in strafing and bombing the Northeast aroused unparalleled resentment among the people. Workers in the Northeast were the most active in the movement, and factories widely launched patriotic production competitions to strengthen national defense construction and enthusiastically signed up to join the army. Farmers' production enthusiasm was high, recognizing that the struggle to resist America and aid Korea was the same as the struggle against landlords, a struggle to defend their fruits of victory. Young students were highly enthusiastic, actively participating in work and the volunteer army.机关职员 technical personnel and teachers all insisted on doing their jobs well. Wang Wenguang from Shanxi mentioned that workers, who account for two-thirds of Taiyuan's population, launched a production competition in the movement, selecting 600 model workers to express their determination to resist America and aid Korea. People from cultural circles in Taiyuan enthusiastically participated in this movement, and a large number of young students participated in propaganda work and signed up to join the army.
    Everyone's speeches reflected the situation of the industrial and commercial circles in various regions. Li Zhuchen reported that the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin held a demonstration and parade on November 30 to resist America and aid Korea. The number of participants increased sharply from the original estimate of 25,000 to more than 42,000, which shows that the hatred of the industrial and commercial circles for American imperialism has been transformed into practical strength, and at the same time demonstrates the firm patriotic stance of the industrial and commercial circles. At the meeting, everyone also unanimously agreed that the patriotic demonstration and parade of the industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin was an action of great significance, an important sign of a new patriotic upsurge, and should be continued. Li Minxin, Chen Yisheng, Hu Ziang, Liang Ruochen, Chen Liangzuo and others mentioned in their speeches that the general awareness of the industrial and commercial circles in various regions has generally increased after liberation, especially after the implementation of unified financial and economic work across the country. With the stabilization of prices and currency values, they are extremely supportive of the government. In the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, after studying, they have shown great enthusiasm. Shanghai and other places have formulated patriotic pacts to ensure no speculation or profiteering and to improve production. The industrial and commercial circles in Shenyang quickly completed the donation of 100,000 sets of winter clothing in a very short period of time; the industrial and commercial income tax was also paid off in a very short period of time. Recently, the purchase of more than 4 trillion Northeast yuan of discounted public bonds was completed in less than 20 days. However, they also pointed out that in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing and other places, when the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea began, due to the attempt of some industrialists and businessmen to speculate and take advantage of the situation, the prices of hardware, western medicine and other items fluctuated for a time. After study and criticism within the industry and the government's effective control, it finally stabilized. This shows that it is still necessary to vigorously carry out current affairs propaganda and ideological education on resisting America and aiding Korea in the industrial and commercial circles.
    Xu Shunying said in her speech that women in Guangdong have actively launched work in the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, mobilizing everyone to go to the countryside, factories, waterfronts, and districts. Going to the countryside is to carry out propaganda and education work in coordination with land reform through farmers' associations and other organizations, to dispel the fear of America and various rumors among the masses; going to factories is to help female workers improve their vigilance and step up production; going to the waterfront is to target women who live on the water, help them organize, and defend against the sabotage of bandit secret agents on the water; going to the districts is to carry out propaganda and education among housewives, and strive to gradually overcome the pro-American and worship-America ideas of those overseas Chinese dependents who rely on overseas remittances for their livelihood.
    Chen Junleng, a representative of the China National Democratic Construction Association in Guangzhou, reported on the situation in Hong Kong. He said that under imperialist rule in Hong Kong, patriots are often expelled or subjected to whippings and imprisonment, and meetings are in danger of being arrested and expelled, so the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement of the people of Hong Kong faces great difficulties. But everyone is still fighting bravely in the face of difficulties. In addition, based on concrete facts, he pointed out the war-weariness of the imperialist people and the contradictions between American and British imperialism. At the docks in Hong Kong, sacks containing the corpses of American soldiers shipped back from Korea are constantly being discovered. Therefore, British soldiers stationed in Hong Kong curse and cry because they are unwilling to be transferred to Korea as cannon fodder, and some smash glass windows, fully demonstrating the war-weariness and low morale of the British imperialist soldiers. From conversations with the British, he saw that the British in general were extremely dissatisfied with American imperialism, because although Britain had won in previous wars, the losses it suffered were greater each time, and everything was controlled and occupied by American imperialism.
    In the discussion, representatives from the Southwest, South China, Shanghai and other places pointed out that because these regions were liberated later or the remaining influence of imperialism was deeper, there were still remnants of fear, worship, and even pro-American sentiments among some of the masses, so it is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education work among them. In addition, everyone also put forward many specific suggestions for the current work of resisting America and aiding Korea. Chen Mingshu, Li Minxin, Wu Zaoxi and others proposed that in carrying out the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, it is necessary to strengthen anti-spy and anti-special agent work at the same time to prevent enemy disruption and sabotage. Chen Renbing proposed that the work of resisting America and aiding Korea should be linked to the united front work, and the various democratic parties must unite as one in order to achieve better results in the movement. Xu Shunying suggested that people from various democratic parties should start by doing it themselves, helping more people around them, and carrying out propaganda and education work. Yan Daogang and Xie Renbing proposed that in carrying out anti-American ideological education, we should link it to the past Japanese imperialist aggression against China and our War of Resistance Against Japan, because the general public has a deep understanding and impression of the Japanese imperialist aggression.
    After everyone spoke, Wu Han, vice president of the Beijing branch, reported on the situation of the Resist America and Aid Korea Movement in Beijing. He pointed out that students in Beijing have used and created many literary and artistic forms that are popular with the masses in the propaganda work of this movement, which has achieved great results. Subsequently, Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda, and Xu Baoju, Minister of Organization of the Chinese People's Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression, respectively reported on the propaganda work and organizational work of the committee.

    保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    邀各民主党派来京代表座谈进一步开展抗美援朝运动
    【本报讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，于五、六两日邀请各民主党派来京开会的全体代表举行茶会，座谈有关抗美援朝运动问题。到会各民主党派代表一百六十余人。座谈会由保卫和平反对侵略委员会副主席彭真、陈叔通主持，该会常委司徒美堂、沈钧儒、邢西萍、邵力子、马叙伦、张奚若、许德珩、许宝驹、黄炎培、彭泽民、蔡畅、罗隆基等均到会参加。我国出席世界和大代表章伯钧并曾在会上报告了二届世界和大会议的经过。
    彭真副主席首先讲话，他说抗美援朝保家卫国是今天中国人民的一件大事，它是中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的中心工作。希望大家充分交换意见，以便进一步开展全国各地抗美援朝运动。
    接着，到会各民主党派代表陈巳生（上海、民建）、李烛尘（天津、民建）、张东木（济南、民建）、陈铭枢（中南、民革）、李民欣（华南、民革）、谢仁冰（上海、民进）、杨子恒（西北、民盟）、吴藻溪（上海、九三学社）、楚图南（西南、民盟）、胡子昂（重庆、民建）、关梦觉（东北、民盟）、巩天民（沈阳、民建）、陈仁炳（上海、民盟）、陈良佐（广西、民革）、王文光（太原、民盟）、晏道刚（湖北、民革）、梁若尘（广东、民盟）、陈君冷（广州、民建）、徐舜英（广州、民革）、吴晗（北京、民盟）等相继发言，分别报告了全国各地正在轰轰烈烈地开展着的抗美援朝保家卫国运动情况，并交流了各地抗美援朝工作丰富经验。
    与会者的许多讲话中都着重地提到各地工人、农民、学生、工商界和其他各界人民日益扩展的抗美援朝保家卫国行动。
    东北的关梦觉、巩天民在发言中讲到，东北人民由于日寇侵华的惨痛经验，和当前的实际生活，深切体验到中朝两国“唇亡齿寒”的关系，认识抗美援朝不是惹祸上身而是扑灭烧身之火；不是影响建设，正是保卫建设。美帝在东北扫射轰炸的侵略行为，更引起人民无比的愤恨。东北工人在运动中最积极，各厂广泛展开了爱国主义的生产竞赛，加强国防建设，踊跃报名参军。农民生产情绪高涨，认识抗美援朝的斗争就和跟地主的斗争一样，是保卫自己的胜利果实的斗争。青年学生热情很高，积极地参加工作和志愿军。机关职员技术人员和教师都坚持做好岗位工作。山西的王文光提到占太原人口三分之二的工人，在运动中发动了生产竞赛，选出劳模六百人，表示抗美援朝的决心。太原文化界人士都热烈参加这一运动。并有大量青年学生参加宣传工作和报名参军。
    大家发言中都反映了各地工商业界的情况。李烛尘报告天津工商业界于十一月三十日曾举行抗美援朝示威游行大会，参加的人数由原来估计的二万五千人骤增为四万二千余人，这说明工商业界对美帝的仇恨已化为实际的力量，同时表现了工商界坚决的爱国立场。会上，大家也一致认为天津工商业界的爱国示威大游行，是具有伟大意义的行动，是新的爱国高潮的一个重要的标帜，应该贯彻下去。李民欣、陈巳生、胡子昂、梁若尘、陈良佐等在发言中，均提到各地的工商业界在解放后一般觉悟均已提高，尤其在全国进行统一财经工作后，物价币值稳定，对政府极为拥护。在抗美援朝运动中，他们经过学习，表现得很积极，上海等地都订立了爱国公约，保证不投机倒把，搞好生产。沈阳工商界在极短期内迅速完成捐献寒衣十万套；工商业所得税也在很短期内缴清，最近认购四千多亿元东北券的折实公债，不到二十天即行完成。但他们也指出，像上海、广州、重庆等地，在美帝侵朝战争开始时，由于部分工商业者的企图投机取巧，五金、西药等价格曾一度波动，经过行业内部的学习和批评及政府的有效掌握，终于平稳下来。这说明在工商业界还需大力开展关于抗美援朝的时事宣传和思想教育工作。
    徐舜英讲话中说广东妇女在抗美援朝运动中，已积极展开工作，发动大家下乡、下厂、下水、下区。下乡是通过农民协会等组织，配合土改进行宣教工作，祛除群众当中的恐美心理和各种谣言；下厂是帮助女工，提高警惕，加紧生产；下水是以过水上生活的妇女为对象，帮助她们组织起来，防御匪帮特务在水上的破坏；下区是在家庭妇女中进行宣传教育，努力逐步克服那些仰赖侨汇生活的侨眷的亲美、崇美思想。
    广州民建代表陈君冷报告了香港情况。他说香港在帝国主义统治下，爱国人士常被逐出境或受鞭笞监禁，开会则有被捕被逐危险，所以香港人民的抗美援朝运动有很大的困难。但大家还是在困难中英勇斗争着。此外，他根据具体事实指出了帝国主义人民的厌战心理和美英帝国主义之间的矛盾。在香港码头上不断发现从朝鲜运回的装着美军死尸的麻袋，因此，驻港英军士兵因不愿调往朝鲜当炮灰，咒骂哭喊，有的则击破玻璃窗，充分表现了英帝士兵的厌战心情及士气的低落。他从与英国人的谈话中，看出英国人一般对美帝极为不满，因为在历次战争中英国虽然获胜，但所受的损失却一次比一次大，一切都为美帝所控制霸占。
    在座谈中，来自西南、华南及上海等地的代表，指出这些地区因为解放较晚或是帝国主义的影响残余较深，在部分群众中还残存着恐美、崇美以至亲美的思想，所以必须在他们中间展开广泛深入的宣传教育工作。此外大家还对目前抗美援朝的工作提出许多具体意见。陈铭枢、李民欣、吴藻溪等提出开展抗美援朝运动，必须同时加强防奸防特工作，以防敌人的扰乱破坏。陈仁炳提出：抗美援朝与统战工作要联系起来，各民主党派必须团结一致，才能使运动获致更好效果。徐舜英则建议各民主党派人士先后自己做起，多帮助自己周边的人，开展宣传教育工作。晏道刚、谢仁冰则提出开展抗美思想教育，应该联系日本帝国主义过去对华侵略及我们的抗日斗争，因为一般人民对日帝的侵略有深刻的认识和印象。
    大家发言后由北京分会副会长吴晗报告了北京市抗美援朝运动情况。他指出北京学生在这次运动的宣传工作运用和创造了许多为群众所喜见乐闻的文艺形式，收到了很大的效果。继由中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会宣传部长罗隆基、组织部长许宝驹分别报告委员会的宣传工作和组织工作的情况。
