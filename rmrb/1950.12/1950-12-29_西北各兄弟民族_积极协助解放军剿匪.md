Xinhua News Agency: The Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Alike ethnic minorities in the Northwest region are actively assisting the People's Liberation Army (PLA) bandit suppression forces in clearing out bandits. Over the past year, a total of more than 60,000 bandits have been eliminated in the Northwest region, of which more than 25,000 were eliminated with the assistance of various ethnic minorities in areas where multiple ethnic groups live together or where ethnic minorities are concentrated.

Under the call of the People's Government for "unity and mutual assistance" and "bandit prevention and self-defense," ethnic minorities in various regions have organized themselves through self-defense forces, village and neighborhood security groups, farmers' associations, and unity associations. They actively cooperated with the bandit suppression troops in bandit suppression operations and automatically searched for and captured scattered bandits. The Alike herdsmen's armed forces in the Qilian Mountains area of ​​Qinghai Province annihilated more than 200 bandits in the battle of Ersi Tan, including 134 captured alive, including the bandit leader Ma Zhenzhong. In May of this year, the Tibetan self-defense force of Xiahe County, Gansu Province, cooperated with the bandit suppression troops to wipe out more than 600 habitual bandits led by Li Yanhu, who occupied the area between Xiahe County and Linxia County. When the Gansu Trading Company was robbed by bandits near Xiahe, the local Tibetan militiamen at the checkpoints immediately went out to pursue and retrieve the tea and cloth that had been snatched by the bandits. In August of this year, Tibetan militiamen in the Dongxiang Autonomous Region of Linxia annihilated 65 scattered bandits, including Tuo Laowu. The Hui militia in Maijiaji, Ningding County, have repeatedly defeated bandits coming to support them and killed the bandit leader "Brigade Commander" Ali Matu. The Hui people of Kangle County led the troops to capture the habitual bandit Zhao Kaichen. Self-defense forces of various ethnic minorities in Qitai, Muleihe and other counties in Xinjiang Province have also been commended by the local people's government for their outstanding achievements in bandit suppression.

Under the influence of the active bandit suppression by the working people of all ethnic groups, the upper-class figures of all ethnic minorities also participated in the bandit suppression work. For example, the Ahong of Ningding County, Gansu Province, participated in the bandit suppression battle, and the Ahong Ma Xizu of Guyuan County assisted the people's government in recruiting more than 100 bandits. Xiang Qian, the Qianhu (official title) of the Angla ethnic group in Guide County, Qinghai Province, assisted the local people's government in searching for bandits and secret agents hiding in the area. The Ahong of a mosque in Ledu County once persuaded 82 bandits to surrender to the people's government.

    西北各兄弟民族
    积极协助解放军剿匪
    【新华社讯】西北区回、藏、蒙、阿力克等兄弟民族积极协助解放军剿匪部队清剿土匪。西北区一年来共剿灭土匪六万余名，其中有两万五千多名是在民族杂居或少数民族聚居地区各兄弟民族协助下剿灭的。
    各地兄弟民族在人民政府“团结互助”和“防匪自卫”的号召下，通过自卫队、村坊治安小组、农会及团结会等方式组织起来以后，即积极配合剿匪部队进行剿匪作战并自动搜捕散匪。青海省祁连山地区的阿力克族牧民武装曾在二寺滩的战斗中歼匪二百余人，其中生俘匪首马振中以下一百三十四人。甘肃省夏河县藏族自卫队曾于今年五月间配合剿匪部队一举歼灭盘居夏河县与临夏县间的惯匪李彦虎股六百余人。甘肃贸易公司在夏河附近遭到匪劫，当地藏族民兵盘查哨闻讯后，即四出追击，夺回被匪抢去之茶叶布匹。临夏东乡自治区的藏族民兵曾在今年八月歼灭散匪托老五等六十五人。宁定县买家集回族民兵曾数次击溃来援土匪，并击毙匪首“旅长”阿里马兔。康乐县回族人民给驻军领路俘获惯匪赵凯臣。新疆省奇台、木垒河等县的各兄弟民族自卫队，也因在剿匪中战绩卓著而受到当地人民政府的表扬。
    在各民族劳动人民积极剿匪的影响下，各兄弟民族的上层人士也参加了剿匪工作。如甘肃省宁定县阿訇曾参加剿匪战斗，固原县马袭祖阿訇曾协助人民政府招抚土匪百余人。青海省贵德县昂拉族千户（官制名）项迁曾协助当地人民政府搜获潜藏该地的土匪特务。乐都县清真寺阿訇曾一次争取八十二名土匪向人民政府投诚。
