Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The American ruling group, due to the irretrievable failure of the war of aggression against Korea, has fallen into a state of panic, dismay, and confusion, unable to find a way out of the tragic situation it has brought upon itself through its adventurous actions.

Despite the heads of the American government stubbornly declaring their continuation of the war of aggression in Korea, and frantically announcing a national "state of emergency," members of Congress, representatives of influential groups, and newspapers who have consistently supported the aggression against Korea are issuing calls to escape the disaster. North Carolina Democratic Senator Hoey, in a statement to the press, demanded an immediate withdrawal of troops from Korea. He said in alarm, "The most urgent consideration at present is to withdraw our soldiers from Korea." Hoey complained, "We have tried to bluff, but it doesn't work."

In Europe, the American bourgeoisie also finds little to be optimistic about. Former US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy, in a speech at the University of Virginia on the 12th, after pointing out the powerful military strength of the Soviet Union and China, said, "To fight these vast armies on the European or Asian continent is foolhardy, yet this is the direction in which our country's policy has been heading. This policy is suicidal." He believes that American foreign policy should be based on two things: "withdrawal from Asia and withdrawal from Europe." He said: "The first step is to withdraw from Korea, in fact, to withdraw from Asia... to choose our own battlefield in the Pacific." "The second step is to apply this principle to Europe. Today, it is useless to talk about holding the Elbe River line and the Rhine River line... It is meaningless to throw troops and personnel into Quixotic military adventures." He called for "retreating from unwise burdens and fully arming ourselves." A December 17th United Press report revealed that retired Marine Corps officer Republican Congressman David Luchs had similar views. He believes that even "when American military aid to Europe is fully effective, the Atlantic Treaty Organization's army may still be forced to retreat." Therefore, he strongly urged the formulation of plans to establish a so-called "rallying point and counter-offensive base" for "democratic forces" in Spain. At the same time, the United Press also quoted the warning of a "widely respected American columnist": In Europe, the US should now "be careful not to 'hoard' American military supplies that might be received by the victorious Soviet army."

A small group of adventurers in the United States are also conducting a frantic clamor to immediately expand the war. But Americans themselves also believe that this is just an empty shout with little practical significance. Even Dewey, who frantically called for so-called "more decisive action," also helplessly admitted in his speech on the 14th: "There is only one division on the entire American continent that is ready to fight at any time—this is not even enough to defend an American city."

### 侵朝战争遭受失败后  美统治集团一片混乱

    侵朝战争遭受失败后
    美统治集团一片混乱
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国统治集团已因侵朝战争的无可挽救的失败，而陷于惊惶失措、悲观失望的混乱状态并且找不到出路来逃脱它因自己的冒险行动而招致的悲惨境遇。
    尽管美国政府首脑顽固地宣布继续侵略朝鲜战争，并慌张地宣布全国处于“紧急状态”，但是一向支持侵略朝鲜的国会议员、有势力集团的代表人物和报纸，却发出要求摆脱灾难的呼号。北卡罗来纳州民主党参议员何埃在他向报界发表的声明中，要求赶紧自朝鲜撤军。他惶恐地说：“目前最紧要的考虑，是把我们的士兵撤出朝鲜。”何埃埋怨说：“我们曾企图虚张声势，但是这并不顶事。”
    在欧洲方面，美国资产阶级也发觉没有什么可以乐观。美国前驻英大使肯尼第十二日在佛吉尼亚大学发表演说，在指出苏联和中国的强大军事力量之后说：“在欧洲或亚洲大陆上，和这些庞大的军队交战是有勇无谋的事，然而这正是我国政策一直趋向的方向。这种政策是自杀的政策。”他认为美国的外交政策应基于两件事，即“退出亚洲和退出欧洲”。他说：“第一步是退出朝鲜，其实是退出亚洲，……在太平洋选择我们自己的战场。”“第二步是把这个原则应用到欧洲去，今天侈谈守住易北河一线和莱因河一线是无益的。……把军队和人员大量投入唐吉诃德式的军事冒险中，无论如何是没有一点意义的。”他要求“从不智的负担中撤退出来，全力武装自己”。合众社十七日电透露退休的海军陆战队军官共和党国会议员戴维鲁克斯也有类似的意见。他认为即使“当美国对欧洲的军事援助充分有效时，大西洋公约国陆军仍可能被迫退却”。为此，他力促制订计划，在西班牙建立所谓“民主部队”的“集合点和反攻基地”。合众社同时又引证了一个“广受重视的美国专栏作家”的警告：在欧洲，现在“美国应小心不要‘囤积’可能被胜利的苏军接收的美国军事物资”。
    美国也有一小撮冒险分子进行着立刻扩大战争的疯狂叫嚣。但是美国人自己也认为这不过是一种并无多大实际意义的空喊。就连狂叫所谓“采取更有决定性的行动”的杜威，在他十四日发表的演说中，也无可奈何地承认：“在整个美国大陆上只有一个师能够随时作战——这连保卫一个美国城市也不够。”
