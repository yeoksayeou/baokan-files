    Recently, students and faculty of universities and middle schools in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and other places launched a heated anti-American patriotic movement. On the "December 9th" anniversary, 100,000 students in Shanghai held a large-scale parade to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, demonstrating against the mortal enemy of the Chinese nation, American imperialism. Teachers, students, and staff of church schools, church groups, and church hospitals in the capital, as well as students studying in the United States, also held a demonstration parade yesterday (the 13th) to protest Austin's shameless slander and defamation of the Chinese people, and to expose the crimes of American imperialist cultural aggression. Teachers and students from Tsinghua, Yenching, Fu Jen, St. John's, Shanghai University, Jinling, Qilu, Xiangya and other schools held meetings of various sizes, issued anti-American patriotic declarations, and sent telegrams. Students from 64 universities and middle schools in Nanjing, led by Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, launched an in-depth anti-insult and anti-slander movement, accusing American imperialist elements of their crimes, criticizing pro-American, worshipping-American, and fearing-American erroneous ideas, and raising their own political and ideological levels. The magnitude, uniformity, and especially the rich and profound ideological content of this just patriotic movement of Chinese students is unprecedented in history. Although previous student anti-imperialist patriotic movements had clear political directions and were very vigorous, they were suppressed and restrained not long after they started, due to being under the rule of imperialist running-dog warlords and compradors. They could not freely develop and deepen; therefore, it was difficult to fundamentally liquidate imperialism ideologically and eliminate the toxins spread by imperialism. Now, with the people's own government, the student movement can fully develop in depth and completely solve the ideological problems that previous movements failed to solve. This movement is closely integrated with practical actions, and young students can fully exert their patriotic will and enthusiasm. Five thousand young students in Shanghai have already signed up to join military cadre schools to enhance the strength of national defense construction and carry out the sacred mission of protecting their homes and defending the country. This movement is a manifestation of a new and higher level of awakening of Chinese youth. Together with the People's Volunteers' aid to Korea and the anti-American patriotic activities of the broad masses of people from all walks of life, it demonstrates a new upsurge in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of the Chinese people.

    This patriotic movement of the Chinese people broke out because of the American imperialists' aggression against China and Korea, and Austin's deceptive and slanderous speech against the Chinese people, especially the insult and defamation of church school students and Chinese religious undertakings, added fuel to the fire, stimulating the rapid and widespread development of the movement. There is a reason why teachers and students of church schools have shown greater enthusiasm in this movement. Everyone knows that the United States uses weapons and money to infringe upon China's sovereignty and run schools in China, which is a blatant act of aggression. As pointed out in the declaration of teachers, students and staff of St. John's University, this is: "American schools, American cultural concessions, and American-owned educational factories established on Chinese territory." The purpose of the United States in setting up these schools with a small portion of the blood and sweat it extracts from the Chinese people and the people of other countries is to spread the toxins of imperialist enslavement ideas, destroy Chinese national culture, harm the minds of Chinese youth, and cultivate a group of pro-American, worshiping-American, and fearing-American slaves, who faithfully serve the interests of Wall Street capitalists and become the obedient tools of the United States' "using Chinese to control Chinese." This, like America's military and economic aggression, is an indispensable part of America's entire plan of aggression; and it is precisely to serve other aggressions. More than 40 years ago, an American businessman and missionary, the imperialist element Smith, revealed this evil purpose of the United States in running education in China. He said: "Spending some money to expand spiritual influence, even if only in a material sense, can yield more than other methods. Commerce follows spiritual domination more reliably than it follows the military flag." However, this apologist for American aggression policy, Austin, when the United Nations Security Council discussed the case of the Chinese government and the Soviet government, who upheld justice for the Chinese people, accusing the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, did not dare to answer directly the charges of his crimes of invading Chinese territory. Instead, he listed the names of the schools run and "funded" by the American churches in China, and the number of graduates, shamelessly calling them "America's traditional friendship with China" and "cultural ties." And he maliciously provoked us, saying: "Can this golden thread that connects the Chinese people and the American people in terms of culture be cut off with one stroke?" Isn't this a great insult and defamation to the Chinese people - especially the Chinese youth who have been educated in schools affiliated with American churches? Isn't this a great insult and defamation to the true friendship between the Chinese and American people? How can this not make the Chinese people - especially the insulted and slandered Chinese youth in church schools - burn with anger, hate to the bone, and rise up to launch a vigorous anti-American patriotic movement to liquidate the American imperialists' crimes of aggression? This patriotic movement of Chinese students gave Austin's shameless and malicious slander the loudest answer: Your nonsense and all your so-called "spirit" can no longer "dominate" us, and our own Chinese culture, as a whole, and not merely in terms of technology, is far superior to yours. The "golden thread" you speak of is nothing more than iron chains, and now we are not only going to cut off this "cultural" iron chain that binds the souls of the Chinese people, but also completely eliminate all the ideological toxins you have spread, so that you can no longer breed aggressive germs on Chinese soil.

    The reason why the likes of Austin are unlucky is that they not only hate the Chinese people, but also openly despise and scorn the Chinese people. He does not know that the youth of modern China are not so easily deceived. America's aggressive cultural investment in China, just like its aggressive economic or political investment, can no longer collect interest as it did in the past. The United States has set up churches and schools in China, and has indeed fostered a small group of lackeys such as T.V. Soong, Wellington Koo, Tsiang Tingfu, and K.C. Wu, who serve as pawns for the United States to invade China and help enslave and exploit the Chinese people. But these national scum are after all a minority within a minority in China. Among the approximately 300,000 people who have received American education, as Austin said, they probably do not amount to one-thousandth, and they have long been spurned by the Chinese people. The broad masses of Chinese educated youth, including those who have received American education, although some of them were temporarily blinded by American deceptive propaganda, have been widely awakened after witnessing the blood-stained crimes of American imperialism and its running dogs, and have been baptized by new progressive ideas. They are fighting resolutely with the workers and peasants for the overthrow of imperialism and for the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation. Chinese educated youth have gained a profound understanding of the ferocious faces of imperialism through the May Fourth Movement, the May 30th Movement, the December 9th Movement, and the anti-aggression, anti-civil war, anti-hunger movement, and the anti-American support-Japan movement. Their political consciousness has been greatly enhanced. Especially after the liberation of the motherland, under the leadership of the People's Government, young students have the opportunity to study and seek knowledge freely, and their knowledge has advanced by leaps and bounds. At this time, Austin dared to flaunt his cultural investment, to buy people's hearts, and to provoke, which is so foolish, ignorant, bold, presumptuous. The anti-American patriotic movement of Chinese young students powerfully taught the imperialists, telling them that the Chinese people who have won independence and freedom cannot tolerate anyone's hatred, contempt, or scorn. Whoever hates, despises, or scorns the Chinese people will inevitably suffer a heavy blow.

    The anti-imperialist patriotic movement of young students in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and other places is an important component of the Chinese people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. It plays a role in supporting the heroic fighting of our People's Volunteers and the Korean people, and encourages the will of the people of China and the world to fight against American aggression and defend world peace. This movement is continuing to develop vigorously. At the same time as the students' accusations and protests, China's religious circles are also expanding their reform movement to break away from American imperialism. In particular, the Catholics in Guangyuan County, Sichuan, recently launched a self-governance reform movement, which is equally worthy of warm welcome. We hope that young students and patriotic Catholics and Christians in other cities and other places will enthusiastically respond to the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, step up the study of current affairs and politics, accuse American imperialists of their aggression and deception, fundamentally understand the American imperialists, this evil enemy, eliminate the remaining poison of American slave thinking, and further understand their own great people's motherland, understand the history and environment of the motherland, understand the superiority of the motherland, understand the strength of the motherland, and understand their own responsibility and obligation to the motherland. Let us use the angry tide of the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle to submerge the domineering American aggressors!

### 进一步开展反帝爱国运动

    进一步开展反帝爱国运动
    最近北京、上海、南京等地的大中学校学生，和教师员工一起，展开了热烈的反美爱国运动。上海十万学生，在“一二九”纪念日，举行了抗美援朝保家卫国大游行，向中华民族的死敌美帝国主义示威。首都各教会学校、教会团体、教会医院的师生员工和留美学生，也在昨（十三）日举行示威游行，抗议奥斯汀侮辱和诬蔑中国人民的无耻谰言，揭露美国帝国主义文化侵略的罪行。清华、燕京、辅仁、圣约翰、沪江、金陵、齐鲁、湘雅等校师生，并曾分别举行大小集会，发表反美爱国的宣言，通电。南京六十四个大中学校的学生，以金陵女子文理学院为前导，开展了深入的反侮辱、反诽谤运动，控诉美国帝国主义分子的罪恶，批判亲美、崇美、恐美的错误思想，提高自己的政治水平和思想水平。这次中国学生的正义的爱国运动，规模的宏大，步伐的整齐，尤其是思想内容的丰富和深刻，是历史上空前未有的。以往历次的学生反帝爱国运动，虽然都有明确的政治方向，都很轰轰烈烈，但因处在帝国主义走狗军阀买办的统治之下，运动起来不久就受到镇压和抑制，不能自由地发展和深入；因此，也就难以从思想上根本清算帝国主义，肃清帝国主义所散布的毒素。而现在有了人民自己的政府，学生运动就能充分地向着深处发展，彻底解决历次运动在思想上所未能解决的问题。这次运动并与实际行动密切结合，青年学生能够充分地发挥自己的爱国意志和热情。上海已有五千个青年学生报名参加军事干部学校，以增强国防建设的力量，执行保家卫国的神圣使命。这次运动是中国青年新的更高度的觉醒的表现。它与我人民志愿军的驰援朝鲜，各阶层广大人民的抗美援朝保家卫国活动一起，表现了中国人民反帝爱国运动的新高涨。
    这次中国人民的爱国运动是因为美帝国主义侵略中国和朝鲜而爆发的，而奥斯汀的欺骗和诬蔑中国人民特别是侮辱和诽谤教会学校学生和中国宗教事业的演说，更如火上加油，刺激了运动的迅速和广泛发展。教会学校的师生之所以在这次运动中表现出更高的积极性，不是没有理由的。谁都知道，美国利用武器和金元，侵犯中国的主权，在中国开办学校，是一种彰明昭著的侵略行为。正如圣约翰大学师生员工的宣言中所指出的：这是：“设在中国领土上的美国学校，美国文化租界，美商教育工厂。”美国从其所榨取的中国人民和其他国家人民的血汗中，拿出一小部分来设立这些学校的目的，是在传播帝国主义的奴化思想的毒素，摧残中国的民族文化，戕害中国青年的心灵，培植一批亲美、崇美、恐美的奴才，忠实地为华尔街大资本家的利益服务，成为美国“以华制华”的驯顺工具。这与美国的军事侵略、经济侵略一样，是美国整个侵略计划的不可缺少的一部分；而且又正是为其他的侵略服务的。四十多年以前，一个美国商人兼教士的帝国主义分子斯密士就曾透露美国在中国办教育的这种邪恶目的。他说：“为了扩张精神上的影响而花一些钱，即使只从物质意义上说，也能够比用别的方法收获得更多。商业追随精神上的支配，是比追随军旗更为可靠的。”但是，这个美国侵略政策的辩护人奥斯汀，在联合国安全理事会讨论中国政府和为中国人民仗义的苏联政府所提出的控诉美国武装侵略台湾案时，对于其侵略中国领土的罪行既不敢正面置答，而竟列举美国教会在中国所举办的和所“资助”的学校的名称，毕业学生的数目，厚颜无耻地称之为“美国对中国的传统友谊”，以及“文化方面的连系”。并且恶毒地向我们挑衅说：“这种在文化方面连系着中国人民和美国人民的金线，究竟能不能一刀两断呢？”这不是对于中国人民——尤其受过美国教会所附设的学校教育的中国青年的极大侮辱和诽谤吗？这不是对于中美人民的真正的友谊的极大侮辱和诽谤吗？这怎么能不使中国人民——尤其是被侮辱被中伤的教会学校中的中国青年怒火中焚，恨入骨髓，并奋起开展轰轰烈烈的反美爱国运动，来清算美帝国主义的侵略罪行呢？中国青年学生的这个爱国运动，给了奥斯汀的无耻的恶毒的诽谤一个最响亮的回答：你的胡言邪说和你们的一切所谓“精神”一样，已经再也“支配”不住我们了，我们中国人民自己的文化，就整个来说，而不是就单纯的技术来说，要比你们的优越得多。你所说的“金线”不过是铁链，我们现在岂止要斩断你们这种束缚中国人民灵魂的“文化”铁链而已，而且要彻底肃清你们所散布的一切思想毒素，使你们再也无法在中国的土壤上繁殖侵略细菌。
    奥斯汀之流的所以倒霉，在于他们不仅仇视中国人民，而且公然鄙视和蔑视中国人民。他不知道现代中国的青年，已经不是那样容易欺骗。美国在中国的侵略性的文化投资，正和侵略性的经济投资或政治投资一样，已经再也不能像从前那样地收取息金了。美国在中国设教堂、办学校，固然豢养出了宋子文、顾维钧、蒋廷黻、吴国桢等一小撮奴才，充当美国侵略中国的走卒，帮助奴役和压榨中国人民。但这种民族败类在中国人中毕竟是少数中的少数，在奥斯汀所说约三十万受过美国教育的人中，大概不会到千分之一，而且他们早已为中国人民所唾弃。而广大的中国知识青年，包括曾经受过美国教育的知识青年在内，虽然也有一部分人曾经暂时被美国的欺骗宣传所蒙蔽，但因目击美国帝国主义及其走狗血迹斑斑的罪行，受了新的进步思想的洗礼，都已广泛地觉醒起来，和工农大众一起，坚决地为打倒帝国主义，谋求中华民族的独立自由而斗争。中国知识青年经过五四运动、五卅运动、一二九运动，以及反侵略、反内战、反饥饿运动和反美扶日运动，对于帝国主义的狰狞面目已经有了深刻的认识。他们的政治觉悟已经大为提高。特别是在祖国解放以后，在人民政府的领导下，青年学生有了自由读书、自由求知的机会，他们的知识突飞猛进。这时，奥斯汀竟敢卖弄他的文化投资，来贿买人心，来进行挑衅，这是何等愚蠢无知，何等大胆放肆，何等不自量力。中国青年学生的反美爱国运动，有力地教训了帝国主义者，告诉他们：争得了独立自由的中国人民，是不能忍受任何人的仇视、鄙视、蔑视的，谁要是仇视、鄙视、蔑视中国人民，谁就非遭受沉重的打击不可。
    北京、上海、南京等地青年学生的反帝爱国运动，是中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动的一个重要的组成部分。它起着支援我人民志愿军和朝鲜人民的英勇战斗的作用，并鼓舞了全中国和全世界人民反对美国侵略、保卫世界和平的斗争意志。这个运动正在汹涌澎湃地继续发展。和学生的控诉抗议运动同时，中国的宗教界也正在扩大它的脱离美帝国主义的革新运动，特别是最近四川广元县的天主教徒也发起了自治革新运动，这是同样值得热烈欢迎的。我们希望其他城市和其他地方的青年学生和爱国的天主教徒、基督教徒，热烈地响应反帝爱国运动，加紧时事政治学习，控诉美帝国主义的侵略和欺骗，从根本上认识美帝国主义这个万恶敌人，肃清美国奴化思想的遗毒，并进一步认识自己伟大的人民祖国，认识祖国的历史和环境，认识祖国的优越性，认识祖国的力量，认识自己对于祖国的责任和义务。让我们以反帝爱国斗争的怒潮，来淹没横行霸道的美国侵略者吧！
