    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) Parliamentary Group issued a statement in late November, denouncing the traitorous Yoshida government for, under the instigation of MacArthur, forcibly implementing the so-called "Electricity Reorganization Act," which undermines Japan's industrial base and paves the way for U.S. economic aggression against Japan. This act was originally scheduled as one of the main bills of the 9th Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet. However, the Yoshida government suddenly decided on November 23rd not to submit it to the Diet, but instead, under the pretext of MacArthur's "letter," arbitrarily issued a "government ordinance" on November 24th, forcibly implementing this "act" that had not been reviewed and approved by the Diet. The JCP Parliamentary Group issued a statement in response, stating that the purpose of the electricity reorganization is to destroy Japan's industrial base and supply international monopoly capital. Although the ruling Liberal Party has an absolute majority in the Diet, it is using such barbaric means. This shows that they do not have the strength to deal with this issue through the Diet. They illegally rely on the power of the occupying forces, disregarding the Diet's right to review and trampling on the will of the people, and dictating the handling of this issue. If the Japanese people allow this barbaric dictatorship, the Japanese people's right to exercise politics according to their own will will be deprived without residue. For the peace and independence of Japan, the JCP is determined to overthrow the Yoshida group's traitorous regime.
    This despotic and treacherous act by the Yoshida government has also aroused dissatisfaction among other opposition parties in Japan.

    斥吉田政府卖国行为     
    擅发政令执行“电力整编法案”为美国对日经济侵略铺平道路
    【新华社讯】东京消息：日本共产党国会议员团在十一月下旬发表声明，斥责卖国的吉田政府在麦克阿瑟指使下，强制执行破坏日本工业基础、为美国对日经济侵略铺平道路的所谓“电力整编法案”。这一法案原订为日本第九届临时国会的主要议案之一，但吉田政府突于十一月二十三日决定不向国会提出，却假借麦克阿瑟的“公函”，于十一月二十四日擅自发表“政令”，强制执行这个未经国会审议通过的“法案”。日本共产党国会议员团特为此发表声明称：电力整编的目的，是要破坏日本工业基础，供养国际垄断资本。执政的自由党虽在国会中拥有绝对多数的议席，但却使用这样横蛮的手段。这说明他们没有力量通过国会来处理这个问题。他们非法地仰仗占领军的权势，以漠视国会的审议权、蹂躏全国人民意志的手段，独裁地处理这个问题。日本人民如果容许这种横蛮独裁，日本人民以自己的意志执行政治的权利就会被剥夺无余。日本共产党为了日本的和平与独立，坚决要打倒吉田集团的卖国政权。
    吉田政府这一专制卖国行为，在日本其他各在野党中也引起了不满。
