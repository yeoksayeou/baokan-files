Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: U.S. imperialism is further expanding its war preparations. According to the U.S. Information Service, Truman submitted a message to Congress on the 1st, requesting an additional $18 billion in "supplemental military spending" to support its war of aggression against Korea and to increase its armed forces "to meet the needs of actions that may occur anywhere in the world." Truman's requested increase in military spending includes an additional budget of $16.8 billion for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year 1950-51, as well as $1.05 billion for expanding the production of atomic weapons.

This is the second time in four and a half months that Truman has requested additional military spending, bringing the total direct military expenditure of the Department of Defense for this year to a staggering $41.8 billion. Adding to this the appropriation of more than $5 billion for so-called "military aid" and no less than $2 billion for atomic weapons, the total will be close to $50 billion, more than double the U.S. military expenditure for 1941-42 (the first year the United States participated in World War II). Truman also revealed that he would "embark on" "further appropriation plans."

Truman's supplemental appropriation request will further inflate the already substantial U.S. fiscal deficit and create more severe inflation. Even before this request for increased military spending, domestic prices and the cost of living in the United States had already been rising rapidly due to the inflation caused by huge war expenditures. According to United Press, wholesale prices for the week ending October 14 were 8.7 percent higher than at the start of the Korean War. The Labor Department's cost-of-living index rose from 170.2 in mid-June to 174.8 in mid-October.

    美国进一步扩大战争准备
    杜鲁门要求再增军费
    【新华社三日讯】美帝国主义正进一步扩大战争准备。据美国新闻处消息，杜鲁门于一日向国会提出咨文，要求再增拨一百八十亿美元的“补充军费”，以支持其侵略朝鲜的战争和增加武装部队，“以应付一旦在世界任何地方发生的行动的必要”。杜鲁门要求扩充的军费，包括国防部一九五○——五一年度追加预算一百六十八亿，以及用于扩大原子武器生产的十亿另五千万美元。
    杜鲁门这一四个半月内第二次要求增拨的军费，使本年度国防部直接军事费达到四百一十八亿元的庞大数目，加上为数五十余亿美元的所谓“军援”拨款和不下二十亿美元的原子武器拨款，总数将近五百亿美元，为美国一九四一——四二年度（美国参加第二次世界大战的第一年度）军费的二倍以上，杜鲁门并且透露将“着手进行”“进一步的拨充计划”。
    杜鲁门这一补充拨款要求，将使美国已经为数甚大的财政赤字更加膨胀，并造成更严重的通货膨胀。早在这笔增加军费的要求以前，美国国内的物价和生活费，就已经因巨大战争开支所造成的通货膨胀加速上升。据合众社报道，到十月十四日为止的一周的批发价格，较朝鲜战争开始时高百分之八点七。劳工部的生活费指数则从六月中的一七零点二升至十月中的一七四点八。
