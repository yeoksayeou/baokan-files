    Capital

    [Our Newspaper] People from all walks of life in the capital warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the UN General Assembly's illegal passage of the resolution to establish a "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee."

    Workers and staff of factories in Beijing unanimously believe that Foreign Minister Zhou's statement represents the will of the people of the whole country, and they are determined to strive to achieve the principles put forward in the statement. Workers at the Beijing Machine Factory held heated discussions on Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The riveting section group unanimously stated their firm opposition to a "ceasefire" without sincerity, believing that if the U.S. imperialists really wanted a ceasefire, they would have to withdraw their invading troops from Korea and Taiwan; wanting a ceasefire without withdrawing troops is clearly to continue the aggression. Hu Quangui, director of the Beijing Tram Repair Factory's trade union, said: "We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and we will take practical actions to improve our trade union work." Worker Wang Zhiheng from the Electrical Factory said: "I know the U.S. imperialists' sinister schemes, and I will step up production and continue to support the Korean people's just war." Qing Gong Guo Yixiang, who has signed up to participate in the military cadre school, questioned, "When the U.S. imperialists landed at Inchon and crossed the 38th parallel, why didn't they propose a ceasefire? We saw through this conspiracy long ago. I will resolutely join the People's Navy to strengthen our national defense and not allow imperialism to invade our motherland."

    Teachers and students of universities and middle schools in Beijing have denounced the shameless conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists to use "ceasefire" to gain a respite and resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University, said: "We Chinese people see very clearly the deceptions and conspiracies of imperialism. Unless the troops of U.S. imperialism and its satellite countries are completely withdrawn from Korea, we will not believe that they are sincere in peacefully resolving the Korean issue!" Professor Yan Jingyao of Yenching University said: "The imperialists still want to use the methods they used to deal with the Chinese people during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek to deal with the Chinese people who have already stood up today, which is really ridiculous. However, judging from this resolution of the UN General Assembly, the imperialists are still not reconciled to their failure, and we should unite to give imperialism a more significant lesson." Normal University, Fu Jen Catholic University, National First Midwifery School, and other institutions have issued statements supporting the several principles for peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou. Cheng Xiance, chairman of the Peking University Student Union, said indignantly: "Foreign Minister Zhou said it well. The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea can truly solve the Korean issue. As long as the American troops do not withdraw from Korea, our volunteers and the Korean People's Army will continue to give the American aggressors a heavy blow." The preparatory committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a written opinion stating: "People with a little common sense today unanimously recognize that this 'ceasefire' proposal is illegal and purely a trick, and we must not fall into its trap." Pu Jiexu, manager of Beijing Zhenbei Tannery, Sun Fuling, manager of Fuxing Flour Mill, and others, expressed that from the standpoint of the business community, they firmly demanded that the American aggressor troops and all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and China's Taiwan.

    East China

    [Our Newspaper] Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement on the 22nd regarding the UN General Assembly's illegal passage of the "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee" resolution has received enthusiastic support from people throughout East China.

    Shao Hengqiu of the preparatory committee of the Nanjing branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang gave a speech, recalling the past tricks of Chiang Kai-shek colluding with U.S. imperialist Marshall to perform the "ceasefire" trick in China, and the deceptive promises made by the U.S. invading army when it crossed the 38th parallel and approached the Yalu River, fully confirming that the current illegal resolution of the UN General Assembly is a conspiracy to win a respite for U.S. imperialism. Therefore, all comrades of the Nanjing Branch of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement and oppose the U.S. imperialist aggression conspiracy. The Nanjing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic League and the Nanjing Municipal Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party also unanimously pointed out in their statements: "The three-person group - on-the-spot ceasefire - peace negotiations - large-scale offensive" this Marshall deception formula can no longer deceive the Chinese people who have stood up. The Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee stated that they would improve production, eradicate the social foundation of imperialist aggression against China - feudal forces, and support our People's Volunteers; young workers should actively participate in military cadre schools to strengthen national defense forces. The Nanjing Municipal Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Democratic Youth and the Student Federation jointly issued a written statement, pointing out: Bloody experience has made the Chinese people fully aware of Marshall-style war preparation conspiracies. U.S. imperialism must quickly withdraw its invading troops from Korea. The Nanjing youth are ready to contribute all their strength at any time. The fact that more than 7,400 young students have signed up to participate in the military cadre school is the best proof.

    The Anhui South District Federation of Trade Unions and other eight people's organizations unanimously pointed out in their statements that the principles for peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou in his statement are in line with the wishes and requirements of the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of the world. Any proposal that deviates from these principles is hypocritical.

    The statements of the people from all walks of life in Jiangsu North, Jiangsu South, Zhejiang and other provinces and cities all pointed out that the U.S. imperialists, manipulating a majority of countries in the United Nations to pass this hypocritical ceasefire proposal, is completely a re-enactment of Marshall's deceptive tactics of "mediating" the Chinese civil war four years ago. Li Daigeng, the person in charge of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, said: "This already bankrupt false peace trap of U.S. imperialism cannot deceive the experienced and powerful Chinese people." Regarding the false peace conspiracy of the ceasefire proposal passed by the UN General Assembly under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the people of East China unanimously expressed their determination to shatter this conspiracy with practical actions. 162 students from Zhejiang University who have signed up to take the military cadre school entrance exam jointly issued a statement saying: We must strive to take up the most glorious position in the motherland, consolidate national defense forces, and resolutely smash all the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism.

    In Jinan, He Zhiping, deputy director of the Shandong Provincial Land Reform Committee, said: "Shandong farmers, who are ending land reform, are determined to contribute everything to protect the fruits of their land and defend their homes and country against the U.S. and aid Korea to strive for true peace." Meng Xianrong, Dong Xiqian and others from the Jinan military cadre school students, who have already been concentrated, said: The Chinese people are already familiar with the US's tricks of false peace, and cannot let this defeated paper tiger gain a breather to hurt people again. They also firmly stated that they must accelerate the learning and mastering of modern military skills to guard the motherland's airspace and territorial waters, and defend peace with strength.

    The Jinan Municipal Third People's Congress Consultative Committee, the Municipal Committee of the Youth League, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Women's Federation, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and other groups have issued written statements, pointing out that the cunning tricks of the United States, which vainly attempts to deceive the people of the world, can only further expose its shameful and rogue nature. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and we are determined to carry out the movement to resist the United States, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country in a more in-depth manner to strive for peace in the Far East and the world.

    Central and South

    [Our Newspaper] People's organizations and people from all walks of life in Central and South China, Wuhan, Henan, Hunan and other places unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement on the UN General Assembly's illegal passage of the "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee" resolution.

    The Preparatory Committee of the Central and South China Federation of Trade Unions called on the three million workers in the region to launch a patriotic production competition to enrich national defense forces to support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The Central and South China Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League and the Preparatory Committee of the Central and South China Student Federation issued written opinions saying: We youth in the region firmly respond to the call to strengthen the motherland's national defense construction, actively apply to military cadre schools, and fight to completely smash the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism.

    The Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the city's 260,000 workers, issued a statement saying: We Chinese people love peace, and we Chinese people have always advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, but we do not need the so-called "peace" of the United States now, because the "ceasefire" that the United States is now demanding is to gain a respite and prepare for another war. The joint statement issued by the Wuhan Municipal Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Democratic Youth, and the Wuhan Municipal Student Federation pointed out: In order to smash U.S. imperialist aggression and strive for true peace, the youth and students of Wuhan are vigorously responding to the call of the motherland, participating in military cadre schools, and strengthening national defense construction.

    The Preparatory Committee of the Henan Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, the Preparatory Committee of the Henan Branch of the Democratic League, and the Henan Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee all issued statements unanimously stating that the Korean issue can only be resolved peacefully under the principles revealed in Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

    The statement issued by the Preparatory Committee of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions believes that the thirteen-nation proposal is to preserve the remnants of the U.S. imperialist troops in Korea so that they can invade Korea and China again. The democratic parties of Hunan Province jointly issued a statement expressing their support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

    North China

    [Our Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: People in Baoding, Inner Mongolia, Gui Sui, Zhangjiakou and other places warmly support the statement of Zhou Enlai, Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, on the illegal passage of the United Nations General Assembly on the establishment of the "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee."

    Zhang Qingchun, director of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out: The so-called Korean armistice proposal, which was illegally passed, is a conspiracy and a habitual trick of U.S. imperialism to take the opportunity to gain a respite and prepare to make a comeback. The highly conscious Chinese people will never be fooled again. We are determined to mobilize 500,000 workers in Hebei to further carry out the patriotic production competition and support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement with practical actions. The employees of the Baoding New China Flour Mill and the students of Baoding No. 1 Middle School unanimously believe that only by realizing Foreign Minister Zhou's proposal that the US troops withdraw from Korea and Taiwan, the Korean issue be resolved by the Korean people themselves, and our country be allowed to join the United Nations can true peace be achieved.

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression, the Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Federation of Trade Unions, the Youth League Committee, the Democratic Women's Federation and other seven people's organizations jointly issued a declaration stating that the US imperialists used the United Nations they manipulated to illegally pass the thirteen countries' proposal on the so-called "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee" in order to gain a respite, maintain existing positions, and prepare for a more ferocious and crazy offensive. The 2.4 million Mongolian and Han people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region fully understand this Marshall-style conspiracy, so we firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and vow to support this statement.

    The Suiyuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and other nine people's organizations issued a written statement pointing out that "the people of Suiyuan have experienced the crimes of U.S. imperialism representative Marshall colluding with war criminal Chiang Kai-shek under the guise of so-called 'mediation' to more frantically massacre the Chinese people four years ago. We will never forget this bloody lesson. We believe that Foreign Minister Zhou's statement represents the common will of the entire Chinese people, and we vow to support and firmly support it with all our strength!"

    The People's organizations in Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou City jointly sent a telegram to support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The telegram pointed out: This statement sharply exposes the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to continue their aggression and clearly states our country's correct and effective proposal for seeking true peace; therefore, this statement is the common voice of all 475 million Chinese people.

    Northeast

    [Our Newspaper] People in Northeast China unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement denouncing the resolution illegally passed by the UN General Assembly to establish the so-called "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee."

    The written opinions of the People's organizations such as the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Provincial Committee of the Youth League, and the Women's Federation all pointed out that the UN General Assembly's illegal passage of the so-called "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee" resolution is essentially to buy time for U.S. imperialism after suffering a crushing defeat on the Korean battlefield, so that it can maintain its position of aggression and prepare to advance again. The written opinions of the People's organizations unanimously expressed their support for the only path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue pointed out in Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, that is, "to insist that the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the settlement of Korean internal affairs by the Korean people themselves should be the basis for negotiations for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the U.S. aggressor troops must withdraw from Taiwan, and the representatives of the People's Republic of China must obtain legal status in the United Nations."

    The written statements of People's organizations in Jehol Province pointed out: This resolution passed by the UN General Assembly under the manipulation of the United States is purely a replica of the trick used by U.S. imperialism four years ago to help Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang expand the anti-people war. The statement said: We, the people of Jehol Province, have already experienced this set of aggressive tricks of U.S. imperialism, so we will never be deceived.

    People and advanced producers in Northeast China, Nie Bingju, female train driver Wang Baohong and other model workers also expressed their opinions, criticizing the U.S. imperialists' despicable behavior of playing deceptive old tricks. Xing Zhaokai, a worker from the Qiqihar Water Plant who attended the National Conference of Labor Models for Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, asked, "If U.S. imperialism really wants to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, why doesn't it withdraw its invading troops from Korea?" Jia Changrong, an advanced production worker at the Nenjiang Leather Factory, said, "U.S. imperialism is like a wounded wolf, trying to heal its wounds before eating people again." Tang Yueqing, a farmer from the suburbs of Andong City, said, "What 'ceasefire'! Are the American devils trying to deceive people again? To this day, American planes are still flying over our heads, and my bombed vegetable field has not been repaired, and the revenge has not been taken yet!"

    Northwest

    [Our Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: People's organizations and people from all walks of life in Xi'an, Lanzhou and other places in the Northwest region have issued statements and talks, expressing their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement on the UN General Assembly's illegal passage of the establishment of the Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee.

    People from all walks of life in Xi'an pointed out that the so-called Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee is a conspiracy by the U.S. imperialists to take the opportunity to gain a respite and prepare to make a comeback. Zhao Zhankui, a nationally famous labor hero, said: "The Chinese working class and the Chinese people have gained full experience in the deceptive tactics of the 'Three-Person Committee' played by the US emperor from the so-called military mediation conducted by Marshall in China four years ago, and will never be fooled by the US imperialists again." Yang Zilian, Secretary-General of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, said: "The only prerequisite for solving the Korean issue is that U.S. imperialism quickly withdraw its troops invading Korea. The so-called 'Three-Person Committee' manipulated by the United Nations by the United States is a delaying tactic after it was beaten to a pulp in Korea. This is the same as Truman's declaration that the country is in a 'state of emergency', both are conspiracies to expand the war of aggression."

    Shi Mujin, a labor model representative from the Lanzhou Northwest Automobile Repair Second Factory who once attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, said after seeing Foreign Minister Zhou's statement: "The US's trick of first ceasefire, then negotiate, and then fight hard has already been used by Marshall in China, and today even children cannot be deceived." Shi Mujin has taken the lead in forming a volunteer automobile repair team to North Korea consisting of twenty-two technicians, ready to go to the front line in Korea to strive for true peace with practical actions. Ma Wenyuan, a Hui agricultural labor model representative living in Lanzhou, firmly stated that he would assist the district farmers' association in mobilizing farmers to participate in winter literacy schools and night schools, study current affairs, and personally expose the conspiracies and tricks of U.S. imperialism to the farmers.

    Chengdu

    苏北、苏南、浙江等省市各界人民的声明中，都指出：美帝国主义操纵联合国多数国家通过的这一虚伪的停战提案，完全是四年前马歇尔“调停”中国内战的欺骗手法的重演。浙江省总工会筹委会负责人李代耕说：美帝国主义这一早已破产了的假和平圈套，是骗不了经验丰富而力量雄厚的中国人民的。对于联合国大会在美帝国主义操纵下通过的这一停战建议的假和平阴谋，华东各地人民一致表示决以实际行动来粉碎这个阴谋。浙江大学一百六十二位已报名投考军事干部学校的学生联名发表声明说：我们要争取走上祖国最光荣的岗位，巩固国防力量，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。

    东北
    【本报讯】东北各地人民一致拥护周恩来外长指斥联合国大会非法通过成立所谓“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的决议的严正声明。
    黑龙江省总工会、青年团省委会、妇女联合会等人民团体的书面意见中都指出：联合国大会非法通过所谓“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的决议，实质上是为美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上遭受惨败后争取喘息机会，以便它保持侵略阵地，准备再进。各人民团体的书面意见一致表示拥护周外长声明中所指出的和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路，这就是“坚持以一切外国军队撤出朝鲜及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决为和平调处朝鲜问题的谈判基础，美国侵略军必须退出台湾，中华人民共和国的代表必须取得联合国的合法地位”。

    曾经出席全国劳模代表大会的兰州西北汽车修理第二厂劳模代表史木金在看到周外长的声明后说：“美帝的先停战、后谈判、然后再大打的诡计，已经由马歇尔在中国使用过了，今天连小孩子也骗不了的。”史木金已带头组成包括二十二个技术工人的志愿赴朝汽车抢修队，准备到朝鲜前线去，以实际的行动来争取真正的和平。住在兰州的回族农业劳模代表马文元坚决表示：要协助该区农会，发动农民参加冬学夜校，学习时事，并要亲自向农民们揭露美帝国主义的阴谋诡计。
