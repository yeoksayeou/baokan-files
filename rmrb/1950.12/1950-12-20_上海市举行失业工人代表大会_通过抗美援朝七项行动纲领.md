    Shanghai Holds Representatives' Conference of Unemployed Workers
    Passes Seven-Point Action Program for Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    [This newspaper Shanghai news] In order to bring into play the power of all unemployed workers in Shanghai to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country, the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee convened a city-wide representatives' conference of unemployed workers on December 13, attended by more than 1,300 people. At the conference, Zhu Junxin, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and director of the Unemployed Workers Relief Office, conveyed the content of the Shanghai People's Representatives Conference from all walks of life for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting their homes, and defending the country. He explained that the unemployment of worker brothers was caused by the destruction of China's industry and commerce by American imperialism in the past. American imperialism is the deadly enemy of unemployed workers, and everyone must take action to support the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteers, and stop American imperialism from expanding its aggression. The conference unanimously passed the Seven Major Action Programs for Unemployed Workers to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Their Homes, and Defend the Country. Subsequently, Xu Shouzeng, an unemployed printing worker whose arm was blown off by American imperialist planes, denounced the crimes of American imperialism; Yu Huian, a cigarette factory worker who volunteered to join a military cadre school, and Huang Jingyu, a driver who volunteered to go to the front lines in Korea to participate in transportation work, also spoke. On the spot, 21 people signed up to join the military cadre school, 12 people signed up to join the volunteer army, 15 people signed up to join the transportation team, and 409 people signed up to join the People's Police. The seven action programs passed at the conference are as follows: (1) Universally carry out current affairs study and propaganda work on resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting homes, and defending the country among unemployed workers, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people with all effective actions. (2) Young workers actively participate in military cadre schools to strengthen national defense forces. (3) Mobilize automobile drivers and transportation workers to serve our Chinese People's Volunteers. (4) Actively participate in the People's Public Security Forces, do a good job in various winter defense tasks such as preventing special agents, bandits, fire, and air raids, and strengthen Shanghai's public security. (5) Actively participate in national defense construction and municipal construction projects. (6) Enthusiastically participate in cultural, political, and current affairs studies, as well as technical training classes such as driver training, nursing, and machinery, in order to improve oneself and prepare to better serve the motherland. (7) Cooperate in supporting the front lines, supply military needs, and vigorously carry out production and self-salvation work such as making military shoes and raincoats.
