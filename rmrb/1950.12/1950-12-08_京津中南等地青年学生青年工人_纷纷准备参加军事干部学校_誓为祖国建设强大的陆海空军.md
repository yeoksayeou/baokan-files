Beijing
[This newspaper's dispatch] Students from universities and middle schools in Beijing are responding to the call to participate in national defense construction and are actively preparing to join military cadre schools.

The China People's University continues to deepen the upsurge of registration to participate in military cadre schools. As of the 4th, the first batch of registered students has reached more than 1,200. The students have expressed that experts in the new China must first be the best patriots and revolutionaries. Now that the motherland needs us to build national defense, we must enthusiastically respond to the call. Now the students are full of fighting will and confidence, ready to participate in actual armed struggle and make contributions to the people.

Middle school students in Beijing are actively requesting to participate in military cadre schools. Students from Hebei Provincial Normal School, Beijing Normal School, and Municipal No. 2 Middle School, in order to better arm their minds before embarking on this glorious post, are now deeply studying and discussing the joint decision of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council, as well as the calls from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Student Federation, the editorial of this newspaper on the 2nd, and Xiao Hua's article welcoming the fifteenth anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement. In the course of studying and discussion, the students have more clearly understood the great significance of participating in military cadre schools to strengthen national defense construction, and have expressed their determination to respond to the call. Zhang Guozhi, a senior student at Municipal No. 2 Middle School, who usually did not like activities, said after several collective discussions: I often feel that the family is so warm, but in order to protect my warm family, to protect the warm families of all Chinese people, I must participate in military cadre schools. Many students with trachoma in the school requested to add eye drops once a day, fearing that this would affect their willingness to participate in national defense construction.

Tianjin
[This newspaper's dispatch] Students and workers in Tianjin are enthusiastically responding to the call of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council to recruit young students and workers to participate in military cadre schools.

Students at Nankai University were overjoyed upon hearing the news. Li Weizhen, a senior in the Department of Economics, was the first to register. He said: Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members should play a leading role in patriotic actions. He Weiqi, a sophomore in the Department of Economics, said: Joining the army is a practical act of patriotism, and the growth of national defense strength is closely related to the safety of the country, so I am determined to participate in military cadre schools. Liu Zongyan said: "Originally, I had some concerns about joining the army in my mind, but my father's letter encouraged me. He said: 'When the motherland needs you, you should dedicate everything you have without hesitation. Do it when you say it, and do it to the end.' So I decided to sign up." In one day on the 4th, 48 students, including Liu Chuji, from the East Campus of the school wrote letters to the student union and the League branch, expressing their determination to respond to the call of the motherland.

Yang Haiyuan, a junior in the Department of Civil Engineering at Peiyang University, was the first to respond to the call to participate in national defense construction. He said: Now is the time when the motherland needs us, and it is also the time for us to show our love for the motherland and the people. We should resolutely respond to the call. Family problems may be a concern for us, but compared with the long-term happiness in the future, this concern will naturally disappear. The League branch of the school has generally launched discussions centered on the call of the Central Committee of the League in various group meetings.

Many students at Hebei Institute of Technology are anxiously waiting for the call and arrangements of the school's League branch and student union. Some have submitted written suggestions to the student union, requesting the rapid establishment of a registration organization. Wei Bo, Wang Shaozu, and others have expressed their willingness to register. Students at Nankai Middle School unanimously believe that dedicating themselves to the modernization of the motherland's national defense is the most glorious thing. Yang Jianbai, the school's director of academic affairs, said that participating in the modernization of national defense construction is a patriotic act, and the principal will give it strong support and help students solve the existing problems. After seeing the decision, League members and students from Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School were deeply afraid that female students could not participate. After seeing the call from the Central Committee of the League and knowing that both male and female students could participate, they were very happy and made requests to prepare to participate.

Young League members and young workers from the Tianjin Leather Factory directly under the factory have asked the factory's League branch about registration procedures. The factory's League branch held a symposium for this purpose. More than 80 League members and young workers participated. The speeches at the meeting were solemn and enthusiastic. Tang Baoquan, Zhang Benchu, and 19 others requested to participate in military cadre schools on the spot. Zhang Benchu said: The people of the whole country place their hopes on us young people. Our good life today was exchanged for the sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs. American imperialism is frantically invading us, threatening our peaceful life, and wants to take us back to the disasters of the past, which we can never allow! Female League member Ren Lanyu, Zhang Xiuqin, and female worker Liu Fulan denounced the humiliation of Chinese women by American imperialism at the meeting, and requested approval to enter the school, learn modern national defense technology, and strike at the enemy. After the meeting, many people who did not have time to speak at the meeting also went to the League branch to make requests.

Zhu Jinglong, Dong Huanchen, and six other young League members from the Tianjin Factory of Central Electrical Appliances Company enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Committee of the League and decided to participate in military cadre schools. They said: Now is the time when the motherland needs us, and we ask the organization to allow us to study in various military cadre schools! Because this is the attitude that our young workers, especially young League members, should have towards the motherland.

Central South
[Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 5th] The vast number of young students in the Central South region are enthusiastically responding to the joint decision of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government and the Government Administration Council on recruiting young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools. The Preparatory Committee of the Central South Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League and the Central South Student Federation specially issued a statement to resolutely respond to this call.

In Wuhan, students from National Wuhan University have expressed their determination to the school student union, school administration, and League branch, requesting that they be recommended to military cadre schools for study. More than 100 students from Wuhan No. 1 Middle School are determined to register. Sixty-seven students from Wuhan Municipal No. 2 Middle School have automatically formed the "Paul Kochakin Combat Team" to prepare to participate in various military cadre schools for study. When the private Shangzhi Middle School held a student representative meeting, all the representatives unanimously expressed that they would resolutely inherit the glorious patriotic tradition of the "December 9th" Movement, mobilize all students to respond to the call of the motherland and participate in the battle to defend the motherland. Students Xu Cifu, Pan Mingliang, Cui Zhihua, Chen Daowen, Zheng Lisheng, and others from the school decided to register to participate in the People's Air Force School for study. In their application forms, they severely denounced the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism against our country; and swore: "To avenge our compatriots killed by American invading Korean military aircraft, and to fight for defending the motherland's airspace and lasting world peace."

The Hubei Provincial Military Cadre School Enrollment Committee has been formally established. The enrollment committee is composed of Song Kanfu, director of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Yeqing, deputy director of the Hubei Provincial People's Government's Department of Culture and Education, Li Renlin, deputy director of the political department of the Hubei Military Region, and responsible persons from the Hubei Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Youth League and other relevant departments, and is starting to handle enrollment matters.

In Jiangxi, students from Nanchang University, Nanchang Normal School, Nanchang Municipal Middle School, and other schools held discussions immediately after reading the decision of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government and the Government Administration Council in the newspapers. Ye Yuanchun and Gao Anzhi, students from Nanchang No. 1 Middle School, said that they would learn the spirit of defending the country of Matrosov in the film "Ordinary Soldier." The Jiangxi Provincial Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League and the Jiangxi Provincial Student Federation issued a call on the 3rd to all League members and students in the province to enthusiastically respond to the great call of the motherland and embark on the glorious post of patriotism.

Chengde
[Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 4th] After the joint decision of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government and the Government Administration Council on recruiting young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools, as well as the calls issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Student Federation were published in the newspapers here, the male and female students of various middle schools and the young workers of various factories unanimously cheered and said: "The time for us to be loyal to the motherland has come." They have applied to the organization to participate. Zhao Linxiang, a young fitter in a factory, immediately found the administrative负责人of the factory and asked to sign up when he heard the news while eating in the canteen. Students from Chengde Normal School are arguing about whether to join the Navy or the Air Force. The school's Youth League General Branch received more than 100 application forms in half a day. Yuan Xiucui, a female student, wrote in her application form: "The motherland has nurtured us. Now is the time to dedicate ourselves to the motherland. I firmly respond to the call. I want to go where the motherland needs me."

Students from various schools and young workers from various factories are eager for the enrollment committee to be established as soon as possible so that they can register.
