    Some Understanding of the Draft Labor Insurance Regulations
    The "Draft Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China" (hereinafter referred to as the "Draft Regulations"), which the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government recently announced for public comment, is one of the important pieces of legislation in the area of labor policy for the new China. Article 32 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "To gradually implement a labor insurance system." Because restoring and developing the people's economic undertakings is the fundamental interest of the people nationwide at this stage, to obtain this benefit, it is first necessary to guarantee the working class a minimum standard of living, alleviate the difficulties in their lives and their worries about birth, old age, illness, and death, and other sufferings. Only then can they work with peace of mind, actively produce, and continuously improve labor efficiency, creating more wealth for the country.
    Since liberation, major cities in Northeast China, as well as Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and other places, and enterprise systems such as railways and posts and telecommunications, have successively implemented labor insurance, but the various regulations are not consistent. Therefore, the formulation of a unified labor insurance regulation is also urgently needed by all parties.
    The Draft Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China was formulated under such requirements after a year of preparation by the Central Ministry of Labor, based on the actual situation in China. It is in line with national conditions and is practical and feasible. We can explain this from the following aspects:
    First, the nature of the periodic labor insurance system to be implemented
    The national labor insurance system that we are about to implement periodically is a government facility to protect labor, the purpose of which is "to protect the health of employed laborers and alleviate the special difficulties and concerns of their lives." It is fundamentally different from the labor insurance systems in capitalist countries, which are paid for by the laborers themselves, compensate according to value, and are purely of a buying and selling trade nature. The capitalist method essentially increases the burden on the working class in order to strengthen the exploitation of the working class. During the Kuomintang rule, there were also capitalist-style labor insurance facilities in a small number of enterprises, but they were even more unreasonable. For example, in terms of the scope and treatment implemented, intellectual departments outnumbered physical departments, staff outnumbered workers, and male workers outnumbered female workers.
    However, our labor insurance differs in degree from that of the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries. In these countries, labor insurance has become a large-scale and universal social undertaking to improve and raise people's living standards.
    Although our country's financial and economic situation has begun to improve and state-owned economic undertakings have begun to recover in key areas, and private industry and commerce have gradually improved and can maintain profits, they are generally still only in the key recovery stage. Therefore, in terms of the current national financial situation as a whole, it is possible and necessary to take out a part of the money to alleviate the special difficulties in the lives of the working class. However, it is still difficult to take out a large amount of money to universally solve all their life difficulties today.
    Second, the scope of application of the Labor Insurance Regulations
    The scope of implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations adopts a key pilot approach. It is tentatively applicable to: "State-owned, joint state-private, and private factories, mines, and their affiliated units and business management agencies employing one hundred or more workers and staff. Various enterprise units and affiliated units belonging to railways, shipping, posts and telecommunications, and banks." After these units have successful pilot programs and gained experience, they will be steadily advanced and promoted. However, enterprises with fewer than one hundred workers and staff, if they are willing to implement labor insurance, may also conclude collective contracts to do so. On the other hand, enterprises within the scope of the regulations that encounter special difficulties that comply with the regulations may also apply for temporary suspension of implementation in accordance with legal procedures.
    Why is labor insurance not implemented for all employed laborers at the same time? In addition to the reason mentioned above that the current national finances are not yet abundant, there are other reasons. For example, we now have complex wage and treatment systems such as the supply system and the low-wage system, and it is difficult to implement labor insurance all at once. Secondly, in capitalist countries, labor insurance work is completely handled by another set of institutions, and a significant portion of the labor insurance fund is used to support a group of bureaucrats in these institutions; while our labor insurance undertaking is executed by the workers' own organization—the trade union—under the supervision of the labor administrative agency. However, at present, trade union members account for only 31 percent of the total number of employees nationwide; although employee associations in major industrial sectors and major cities have been basically organized at 55 to 88 percent, they have not been fully established. In some regions and sectors, trade union organizations are not yet sound enough, and the existing institutions cannot handle labor insurance work comprehensively for the time being. Furthermore, labor insurance is a new and very complex task. In the past, there was a lack of experience and the quality of cadres was very poor. It is necessary to train a group of cadres, and training cadres also requires a considerable period of time.
    Third, the source and payment of labor insurance funds
    In capitalist countries, a very small portion of the labor insurance fund is borne by the state, and sometimes even entirely by the workers. For example, in the United States from 1938 to 1942, workers paid $4.3 billion in pension insurance, but the expenditures did not exceed $800 million. Therefore, in fact, the labor insurance fund became a disguised surtax.
    In the Soviet Union, the labor insurance fund is entirely borne by the state, and it has gradually become an important item in the national financial budget. Labor insurance has actually become a social insurance system and a major factor in improving the material and cultural life of the working class. The Soviet labor insurance fee is 3.8 to 10.7 percent of the total wage. The medical relief and housing construction fees borne by the state are not included.
    All expenses for handling labor insurance in our country are also borne by the administrative side or the capitalists. However, because the national financial and economic situation has not fundamentally improved; the Draft Regulations stipulate that only 3 percent of the total wages of all workers and staff will be taken out as the labor insurance fund. Although this amount is much less than the labor insurance funds in the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries, plus the medical expenses, medical equipment expenses, various subsidies, and other cultural, educational, and welfare undertakings directly paid by the factory, the total labor insurance expenditure is about 9 percent of the total wage, which is not a small amount. As long as you think about the fact that millions of cadres today are still living on the supply system and low wages, you can be satisfied.
    The payment method of the labor insurance fund is: part of it is directly paid by the administrative side or the capitalists of each enterprise, including wages, medical treatment expenses, and funeral expenses for work-related and non-work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths; another part is paid by the administrative side or the capitalists of the enterprise to the labor insurance fund and is controlled by the trade union, including subsidies or relief funds for work-related and non-work-related disabilities, survivor benefits or relief funds, pension subsidies, and maternity subsidies. Why not calculate them together in the labor insurance fund and divide them into two parts for payment? This is because the labor insurance fund allocated to the trade union for safekeeping is only 3 percent of the total wage, and the amount is not very large, while hospitals and other treatment institutions are large in scale, and it is difficult for the trade union to run them alone for the time being. On the other hand: the part of the labor insurance fee directly paid by the enterprise administration or the capitalists has the nature of passive ex-post compensation (such as treatment subsidies for injuries and disabilities, etc.). In order to reduce the expenditure of this part of the labor insurance fee, they will pay attention to doing a good job in labor protection and running welfare undertakings well, and actively prevent accidents that damage workers' health and regularly care about the health of workers.
    Fourth, the treatment of various labor insurance items
    The Draft Regulations make appropriate provisions for the treatment of workers and staff in terms of birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability, etc., and take care of the illness and funeral arrangements of the dependents of workers and staff; detailed measures are also stipulated separately for the establishment of collective labor insurance undertakings such as sanatoriums, disability homes, nursing homes, and convalescent homes, implementing the basic spirit of alleviating the special difficulties and concerns in the lives of workers and staff. Now, let us analyze and state the main points of our understanding of the legislative intention of various treatments as follows:
    (1) The treatment of work-related and non-work-related injuries, disabilities, deaths, etc., is different, which can be seen in the provisions of Articles 12, 13, and 14. The reasons are very obvious: the former suffered damage in the work, that is, they sacrificed their health for production, and this part of the people should be given special care; as for non-work-related injuries, disabilities, and deaths, although they are not for work, such disasters are sometimes inevitable, and in order to make workers work with peace of mind and eliminate concerns in this regard, it is also right to protect and take care of them; non-work-related disabilities can receive monthly disability relief funds equal to 20 to 30 percent of wages until death. Although the amount is not large, it can maintain the minimum living standard of the injured, which is fundamentally different from the complete disregard of capitalist countries.
    (2) There are reasonable provisions for funeral expenses, funeral subsidies, survivor pensions, and survivor relief funds, which are completely different from the period of reactionary rule in the past. At that time, "when a worker died, at most 200 catties of millet would be spent to buy a coffin, and even the worker's wife and children would have to kneel down and kowtow to the boss to beg for it." But our situation today is completely different. In the Draft Regulations, in addition to stipulating the issuance of funeral expenses, more emphasis is placed on the care of the deceased's relatives. For example, when a worker or staff member dies due to work, it is stipulated that survivor pensions shall be paid monthly according to the number of dependents, the amount of which is 25 to 50 percent of the deceased's wage, until the dependents lose the conditions for support; in the event of death due to non-work-related injuries, survivor relief funds equal to three or twelve months of the deceased's wage are also issued. To dispel the workers' concerns about death, we should mainly start by taking care of the lives of their survivors. This also shows that the formulation of the Draft Regulations is by no means merely a formality, but is sufficient to solve the problem.
    (3) The provisions for pension subsidies are also very important. We Chinese have an old saying, "Raise children to provide for old age," which is a reflection of the lack of social security for people's lives after they get old. Therefore, there is a bad habit of keeping technical secrets among the working masses. Article 15 of the Draft Regulations specifically stipulates the method of pension subsidies. This method is a major event for the working masses, which can reduce and eliminate their biggest concerns and greatly increase their enthusiasm for production. This is something that the reactionary rule in the past never thought of and could not do.
    (4) The reactionary rule never paid attention to the protection of underground miners and workers and staff engaged in heavy labor and harmful health work such as chemical and military industries. Everyone knows that in the past, the wages of workers engaged in this part of the work were lower than those of workers in general light industrial sectors, and other treatments were also very bad. After liberation, the People's Government attached great importance to this issue. However, to fundamentally change this unreasonable phenomenon, today's conditions are still not possible, and we can only make some appropriate adjustments; therefore, in terms of enjoying pension subsidies, the age and seniority of workers and staff engaged in this type of work are stipulated to be lower than those of ordinary workers, indicating special protection and preferential treatment for them.
    (5) The length of service in the enterprise also makes a difference in enjoying various treatments. This provision is of great significance to our future industrial development. Because workers' mobility is high, it is not easy to improve their proficiency in production technology, which is a loss for the entire production undertaking; in order to reduce workers' mobility, it is necessary to stabilize workers' work, and this provision will be one of the effective ways to achieve this goal.
    (6) It can be seen in the Draft Regulations that the state gives special protection to female workers. In addition to the general labor insurance treatments for female workers being stipulated in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work, in order to take care of their special physiological conditions and protect the next generation, they are also given certain special treatments; the Draft Regulations stipulate that production and miscarriage have certain holidays, wages are paid as usual during the holidays, and maternity subsidies are issued. The age for enjoying pension benefits is also lower than that of ordinary male workers.
    (7) Certain labor insurance treatments are also given to the families of workers and staff. The Draft Regulations stipulate that dependents of workers and staff can enjoy free medical treatment; in the event of the death of the provider, survivor pensions can be obtained. In addition, the family members of workers and staff also receive funeral subsidies when they die, and maternity subsidies of five feet of red market cloth at local retail prices can be obtained when they give birth to children. This expenditure is quite large. In particular, maternity subsidies. According to statistics from the Northeast, maternity subsidy expenses account for 18.2 percent of the total insurance fund, ranking second among various expenses. Some people will ask: What is the difference between this and social insurance? Will such a large burden affect the capital accumulation and expanded reproduction of enterprises? We believe that, from the perspective of the burden, this expense is still paid from the stipulated labor insurance fund and medical welfare expenses, and there is no additional burden on the enterprise; and from its significance, in any city, employed laborers plus their families account for more than half of the city's population. For example, in Beijing, with a population of 2 million, there are about 400,000 employed laborers. Calculated by three family members per person, the number of employed laborers plus family members is more than 1.2 million; in Shanghai, with a population of 6 million, there are more than 1.1 million employed laborers. Adding their families, there are about 3.3 million people. If the trade union can organize all employed laborers and unite their families around the trade union, it can become the most important pillar of the People's Government in the city. Therefore, our labor insurance has not only economic significance, but also very important social and political significance.
    (8) The difference in treatment between trade union members and non-members is a very important article. The Draft Regulations stipulate that workers and staff who have not joined the trade union can only enjoy half of the labor insurance treatment in some provisions. Of course, some people will definitely ask: Workers and staff who are also participating in economic construction, and the labor insurance fund is paid by the state or the capitalists of private enterprises, why is the treatment different? We believe that this is a principled issue, because the trade union is a mass organization of workers voluntarily combined. New democratic China encourages the working class to organize better and play its due role in construction. The trade union is an important pillar of state power. Therefore, it is right to give preferential treatment to trade union members. On the other hand, in order to win over and educate those workers and staff who are influenced by backward ideas and unwilling to join the trade union to join the trade union; and to urge those individual members who have repeatedly made mistakes and failed to obtain trade union membership to work hard to produce and strive for progress, such provisions are also very necessary.
    (9) The Draft Regulations stipulate that labor models and combat heroes who have made special contributions to the enterprise and transferred to the enterprise can enjoy more excellent labor insurance treatment (Chapter 4). This is different from the labor insurance system of any capitalist country. The special feature of capitalist countries is to oppress and exploit laborers. We are a people's democratic country led by the working class, and we respect and protect laborers; therefore, labor models and combat heroes should be respected politically, socially, and legally. Our labor insurance system is not absolute egalitarianism. It should stipulate different treatments according to the role of laborers in the national economy and the size of their contribution to the country and the people.
    The above is our understanding of the Draft Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China. The implementation of this regulation is an initiative in our country and will also be a major event for the working class. We hope that everyone will carefully study and discuss it together.

### 关于劳动保险条例草案的几点认识

    关于劳动保险条例草案的几点认识
    最近中央人民政府政务院通告征求意见的中华人民共和国劳动保险条例草案（以下简称条例草案），是新中国劳动政策方面的重要法案之一。共同纲领第三十二条就明白规定：“逐步实行劳动保险制度”。因为恢复和发展人民的经济事业是现阶段全国人民的根本利益，要获得这种利益，首先必须保障工人阶级起码的生活，减轻他们生活的困难与对于生、老、病、死等痛苦的顾虑，然后才能使他们安心积极生产，不断地提高劳动效率，为国家创造更多的财富。
    解放以来，东北各大城市及天津、太原、石家庄等地和铁道、邮电等企业系统均已先后实行了劳动保险，但各种规定还不一致，因此制订一个统一的劳动保险条例也是各方面所迫切需要的。
    中华人民共和国劳动保险条例草案就是在这样的要求下经过中央劳动部一年的准备，实事求是地根据目前中国的实际情况来制订的。它是符合国情和切实可行的，我们可以从以下几方面说明：
    第一、定期实施的劳动保险制度的性质
    我们将要定期实施的全国性的劳动保险制度，是政府保护劳动的一种设施，其目的在于“保护雇佣劳动者的健康和减轻他们生活的特殊困难与顾虑”。它与资本主义国家由劳动者自己掏钱，按值赔偿，纯属买卖贸易性质的劳动保险制度根本不同。资本主义的办法实质上是加重了工人阶级的负担，是为了加强对工人阶级的剥削。国民党统治时代在很少数的企业中也有过资本主义式的劳动保险设施，可是更不合理。例如实行的范围和待遇方面，都是智力部门多于体力部门，职员多于工人，男工多于女工。
    但是，我们与苏联及其他新民主主义国家的劳动保险，也有程度上的差别。在这些国家中，劳动保险已成为改善和提高人民生活的一种大规模的和普遍性的社会事业。
    目前我们国家的财政经济状况虽已开始好转，国营经济事业虽已在重点恢复，私营工商业虽已逐渐好转并能保本获利；但一般都还只是在重点的恢复阶段，因此就目前国家整个财经情况来说，拿出一部分钱来，减轻工人阶级生活上的特殊困难是可能的与应该的，但是，要拿出大量的钱来普遍解决他们一切生活困难，在今天却还是很难办到的。
    第二、劳动保险条例的适用范围
    劳动保险条例实行的范围是采取重点试行办法。暂定适用于：“雇佣工人与职员人数在一百人以上的国营、公私合营、私营的工厂、矿场及其附属单位与业务管理机关。铁道、航运、邮电、银行所属的各企业单位及附属单位。”俟这些单位试行有了成绩，取得经验，再行稳步前进，予以推广。但工人职员在一百人以下的企业，如果愿意实行劳动保险，也可订立集体合同来办理。另一方面，在条例适用范围内的企业，如遇有合乎条例规定的特殊困难情形，也可依照法定程序，呈准暂缓办理。
    为什么不对所有雇佣劳动者同时施行劳动保险呢？关于这一点，除了上面所说的目前国家财政还不充裕的原因外，还有其他原因。例如：现在我们有着供给制、低薪制等复杂的工资待遇制度，要求一下子全部实行劳动保险是很难办到的。其次，在资本主义国家里，劳动保险的工作完全由另一套机构来办理，劳动保险金中分了不小的一部分来供养这些机构中的一批官僚；而我们的劳动保险事业是在劳动行政机构监督之下由工人自己的组织——工会来执行的。然而目前全国工会会员还只占全国职工总数的百分之三十一；各主要的产业部门和各主要城市的职工会虽已有百分之五十五至八十八基本上组织起来，但还没有全部建立，在某些地区和部门中，工会组织也还不够健全，就已有机构来说，一时也还不能全面办理劳动保险工作。再说，劳动保险是一种新的和非常复杂的工作，过去缺乏经验，干部条件很差，必须训练一批干部，而训练干部也需要一个相当的时期。
    第三、劳动保险金的来源与支付
    资本主义国家的劳动保险金，极少的部分由国家负担，有时甚至全部由工人负担。例如，美国一九三八年到一九四二年工人缴纳了四十三亿美元的养老保险金，而支出的却没有超过八亿美元，所以事实上劳动保险金成了一种变相的附加税。
    在苏联，劳动保险金是完全由国家负担，而且在国家财政预算上已逐渐成为一个重要的项目，劳动保险实际上已经是一种社会保险制度，成为改善工人阶级物质文化生活的主要因素之一。苏联劳动保险费为工资总数的百分之三·八至一○·七。国家负担的医药救济，住宅建筑等费还未计算在内。
    我们办理劳动保险开支的各项费用也全部由行政方面或资方负担。但是由于国家财政经济状况还没有根本好转；条例草案规定只拿出等于全部工人与职员工资总额的百分之三作为劳动保险金。这个数目比起苏联和其他新民主主义国家的劳动保险金，虽然差得多，但加上厂方直接支付的医药费，医疗设备费，各项补助金，及其他文教福利事业等项，劳保开支总数约达工资总额的百分之九，也不算少。只要想一想，今天数百万干部仍然过着供给制和低薪制的生活，也就可以满足了。
    劳动保险金的支付办法是：一部分由各企业行政方面或资方直接支付，因工和非因工负伤，疾病、丧葬的工资、医药治疗费及丧葬费等属之；另一部分由企业行政方面或资方缴纳劳动保险基金交由工会支配，因工和非因工残废，遗族抚恤的补助金或救济金、养老补助金和生育补助金等属之。为什么不一起算在劳动保险基金内而分成两部分支付呢？这是因为拨交工会保管的劳保基金只有工资总数的百分之三，数目既不很大，而医院等治疗机构规模宏巨，由工会单独来举办一时也有困难。另一方面：由企业行政或资方直接开支的一部分劳保费是含有消极的事后弥补的性质（比如负伤、残废的治疗补助等），他们为了减少这一部分劳动保险费的开支，就会注意搞好劳动保护工作，办好福利事业，从积极方面来防止有损工人健康的事故和经常关心工人体格的健康。
    第四、各项劳动保险的待遇
    条例草案对工人和职员的生、老、病、死、伤残等待遇都作了适当的规定，工人职员供养的亲属的疾病和丧葬等并予照顾；关于集体劳动保险事业如疗养所、残废院、养老院、休养所等也规定另订详细办法，予以举办，贯彻了减轻工人职员生活中的特殊困难与顾虑的基本精神。现在再把我们对于各项待遇立法原意的认识举其要点析述如次：
    （一）因工和非因工负伤、残废、死亡等的待遇是不同的，这在第十二、十三、十四条的规定中可以看出，其理由很为明显：前者是在工作中受到了损害，也就是为了生产牺牲了自己的健康，这一部分人是应该特别照顾的；至于非因工伤残和死亡，虽然并不是为了工作，但这种灾难有时是不可能避免的，为了使工人安心工作，消除这方面的顾虑，予以保护和照顾，也是应该的；非因工残废每月可得等于工资百分之二十到三十的残废救济金，直到死亡为止，数目虽不大，也能维持受伤者最低的生活，这与资本主义国家的完全置之不理，是根本不同的。
    （二）关于丧葬费、丧葬补助金与遗族恤金、遗族救济金等都有合乎情理的规定，与过去反动派统治时期是完全不同的。那个时期，“一个工人死了，顶多花上二百斤小米买口棺材，甚至还要工人的老婆孩子向老板下跪磕头求情，才能得到。”而在我们今天的情形却完全不同了，在条例草案中，除了规定发给丧葬费外，更着重对死者亲属的抚恤。例如：工人职员因工死亡时，规定依其供养亲属人数每月付给遗族恤金，数目为死者工资的百分之二十五到五十，直至受供养人失去供养的条件为止；非因工负伤死亡时也发给等于死者工资的三个月或十二个月的遗族救济金。要解除工人群众对死亡的顾虑，主要应该从照顾他们遗族的生活来着手，这一点也就说明了条例草案的制定，决不是徒具形式，而是足以解决问题的。
    （三）养老补助金的规定也是很重要的。我们中国有句老话，所谓“养儿防老”，这是人们老了以后的生活没有社会保障的反映。因此在工人群众中就有保守技术秘密的不良习惯。条例草案第十五条具体规定了养老补助金的办法，这个办法对工人群众来说，是一件大事，可以减轻和消除了他们最大的顾虑，大大的提高生产热情，这是过去反动派统治时期根本没有想到和不能做到的。
    （四）对于井下矿工及从事化工兵工等繁重劳动和有害健康工作的工人和职员的保护，反动派统治时期从未加以注意。大家都知道，过去从事这部分工作的工人的工资比一般轻工业部门工人还要低，其他的待遇也是很恶劣的。解放后，人民政府就很重视这个问题。但是要根本改变这个不合理的现象，今天的条件还不可能，只能做到一些适当的调整；因此关于享受养老补助金方面，从事这类工作的工人和职员在年龄和工龄上规定得要比一般的工人低些，表示对他们特别的保护和优待。
    （五）在本企业工龄的长短，对于享受各种待遇也是有所不同的。这一点规定，对我们今后工业的发展有很重大的意义。因为工人流动性大，对生产技术熟练程度就不容易提高，从整个生产事业来说是一种损失；为了减少工人的流动性，必须使工人的工作稳定下来，这种规定将是达到这个目的的有效方法之一。
    （六）在条例草案中可看得出国家对女工是特别予以保护的。女工的一般劳保待遇除了依照同工同酬的原则规定外，为了照顾她们特殊的生理状态和保护下一代，还给她们享受了某些特殊待遇；条例草案规定生产和小产有一定的假期，假期工资照发，并发给生育补助金。在享受养老金的年龄方面也比一般男工订得低些。
    （七）关于工人职员的家属也给予某些劳动保险的待遇，条例草案规定：工人和职员供养的亲属可以享受免费诊疗；供养者死亡时可以得到遗族抚恤金。此外，工人和职员的亲属死亡时也得到丧葬补助金，生育子女时可以获得按当地零售价格的五尺红市布的生育补助金，这笔开支是相当大的，特别是生育补助金，据东北的统计，生育补助金开支占保险基金总数的百分之十八·二，居各种开支的第二位。有人会问：这与社会保险有什么区别呢？这么大的一个负担是不是要影响企业的资金积累和扩大再生产呢？我们认为，从负担上看，这笔费用仍在规定的劳动保险金和医药福利费用中开支，并没有额外增加企业的负担；再从它的意义来讲，在任何一个城市中，雇佣劳动者加上他们的家属，都占城市人口的半数以上，例如北京在二百万人口当中，有四十万左右的雇佣劳动者，每人按三口家属计算，那么雇佣劳动者加上家属就有一百二十万人以上；上海六百万人口中有一百一十多万是雇佣劳动者，加上他们的家属，便约有三百三十万人以上。如果工会能把所有的雇佣劳动者都组织起来，并把他们的家属团结到工会的周围，便可成为人民政府在城市中最主要的支柱。因此，我们的劳动保险除了具有经济的意义外，还有很重要的社会意义和政治意义。
    （八）关于工会会员和非会员待遇的差别，是很重要的一条。条例草案中规定凡是没有参加工会的工人和职员，在一部分规定中只能享受劳动保险待遇的一半。当然一定有人要问：同样是参加经济建设的工人和职员，劳动保险金又是国家或私营企业的资方拿出来的，为什么待遇不一样呢？我们认为这是一个带有原则性的问题，因为工会是工人阶级自愿结合的群众性组织，新民主主义的中国是鼓励工人阶级更好的组织起来，发挥其在建设中应有的作用，工会是国家政权的重要支柱，因此对工会会员予以优待是应该的。另一方面，为争取和教育那些受落后思想影响不愿参加工会的工人与职员参加工会；并督促那些屡犯错误未能取得工会会员资格的个别分子努力生产，力求进步，这样的规定也是很必要的。
    （九）条例草案规定，凡是对本企业有特殊供献的劳动模范及转入本企业的战斗英雄，可以享受较优异的劳保待遇（第四章），这与任何资本主义国家的劳动保险制度不同，资本主义国家的特质是压迫和剥削劳动者，我们是工人阶级领导的人民民主国家，是尊重和保护劳动者的；因此，劳动模范和战斗英雄，无论在政治上、社会上或法律上都应该受到尊重。我们的劳动保险制度不是绝对的平均主义，它应根据劳动者在国民经济中所起的作用和对国家人民贡献的大小来规定不同的待遇。
    以上是我们对中华人民共和国劳动保险条例草案的几点认识。这个条例的实施，在我国是一个创举，也将是工人阶级的一件大事，希望大家共同仔细研讨。
