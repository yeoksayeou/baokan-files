Reaction to People's Daily Criticism

    Rectification of the Careless Handling of Counter-Revolutionary Cases
    Zhengding County Government's Self-Criticism
    The case of the local tyrant and landlord Fang Luoyu's counter-offensive and settling of scores, resulting in the murder of our Village Chief Comrade Kang Yuhuan, has been dealt with. Here is a self-criticism regarding the first and second points inquired about by Comrade Jiang Long (see People's Daily, October 14th):
    After this incident occurred, the County Government's Judicial Section should have conducted an in-depth investigation among the masses. The county leadership should have sent capable cadres to understand and comfort Comrade Kang Yuhuan's family and promptly and severely dealt with the counter-revolutionary elements. However, the County Government did not send anyone to comfort Comrade Kang Yuhuan's family, nor did it go to the village to investigate. Instead, it carelessly judged the case of the local tyrant and landlord's counter-offensive and murder of the village chief as an accident where Comrade Kang Yuhuan was run over by a cart. The sentences for the criminals were reversed in severity. The accomplice, Fang Heigou, was sentenced to four years in prison, while the main culprit, Fang Luoyu, was sentenced to only six months in prison. Later, due to bribery from village cadres, the criminals were released.
    After an in-depth examination of the handling of this case, we discovered that we had serious bureaucratic work styles, political numbness, and a lack of a people-serving mindset. After the judgment was issued, Comrade Kang Yuhuan's family was dissatisfied and appealed to the county. The county leadership and the court did not properly consider the reasons for their dissatisfaction and simply gave Kang Yuhuan's family 400 jin of rice as burial expenses to resolve the matter. Such failure to listen to the voices of the masses, failure to consider the opinions of the people, making careless judgments without investigation, and arbitrarily modifying judgments are all our mistakes. The existence of such errors has boosted the arrogance of counter-revolutionary elements and dampened the productive enthusiasm of the emancipated peasants.
    Due to Comrade Jiang Long's accusation, the higher judicial organs sentenced Fang Luoyu to death and Fang Heigou to seven years in prison. Fang Luoyu was executed by firing squad on November 27th.

### 对轻率处理反革命案件  正定县府的检讨

    对轻率处理反革命案件
    正定县府的检讨
    我县恶霸地主房洛雨反攻倒算，杀害我村长康玉环同志事件，已经处理。兹对江龙同志所询一、二两点（见十月十四日人民日报）检讨如下：
    这一事件发生后，原应由县府司法科深入群众调查，县领导机关并应派得力干部去了解与安慰康玉环同志家属，并对反革命分子及时严正处理。县府并没派人去安慰康玉环同志家属，且更没有到该村去调查，即轻率将恶霸地主反攻倒算杀害村长案件，判决成大车压死了康玉环同志。对于凶犯判刑则轻重倒置，次犯房黑狗判处四年徒刑，主犯房洛雨则仅判处半年徒刑；后因村干部受贿来保，即又将凶犯释放。
    对这一案件的处理经过，经我们深入检查，发现我们存在着严重的官僚主义作风，政治上麻痹大意缺乏为人民服务的思想。待判决发出后，康玉环同志家属不服，到县申述时，县领导机关及法院却没有很好地考虑他不服的理由，就又给康玉环四百斤米作埋葬费完事。似这样不听群众的呼声，不考虑人民的意见，不经调查，马虎判决又随意修改判决，都是我们的错误。由于这种错误的存在，就助长了反革命分子的气焰，打击翻身农民的生产情绪。
    该案因江龙同志的控诉，经上级司法机关判处房洛雨死刑，房黑狗徒刑七年。房洛雨已于十一月二十七日执行枪决。
          正定县人民政府  十二月二十日
