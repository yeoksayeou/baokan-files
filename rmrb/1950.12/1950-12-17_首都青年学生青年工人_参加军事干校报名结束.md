    Capital Youth Students and Youth Workers
    Finish Enrolling for Military Cadre Schools
    [This newspaper's report] The work of universities, middle schools, and factories in Beijing to enroll people to participate in military cadre schools ended on the 16th. A total of 1,879 students from twelve universities including Peking University and Tsinghua University enrolled; a total of 5,076 students from seventy middle schools including National Advanced Industrial School and Municipal No. 1 Middle School enrolled (excluding middle schools in the suburbs and North China Middle School, etc.); according to preliminary statistics, 263 young workers have been initially examined and approved by the factory recommendation committees (the Shijingshan Power Plant, etc. are not included in the statistics).
    The enrollment situation was extremely enthusiastic. At the Central Academy of Fine Arts, as soon as the enrollment began, many people were waiting at the entrance of the registration office. Geng Zhiya, a female worker at the People's Printing Factory, got up at three o'clock in the morning on the first day of registration, washed her clothes, and waited to go to register early.
    Young students and young workers enrolled with the determination to fight a decisive battle against American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. Xia Dingguan, a student at Yenching University, swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait after enrolling: "I will join the People's Navy and resolve to drive the Chiang bandits out of Taiwan!" Peng Shouqing, a student at Fu Jen Catholic University, said excitedly after enrolling: "I hope to be in this great ranks to wage a tenacious struggle against American imperialism and strive to join the New Democratic Youth League." However, the enrolled students and workers have also made full ideological preparations: If they are not approved, they will, like the students and workers who were unable to enroll, stay and study hard, step up production, and actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.
    Now the major universities, middle schools, and factories are actively preparing to send them off.

    首都青年学生青年工人            
    参加军事干校报名结束
    【本报讯】京市大中学校和工厂报名参加军事干部学校工作，已于十六日结束。北京、清华等十二个大学报名学生共一千八百七十九人；国立高工、市立一中等七十个中学报名学生共五千零七十六人（郊区各中学及华北中学等校不在内）；青年工人，初步统计经各厂保送委员会初步审查批准的，有二百六十三人（石景山发电厂等尚未统计在内）。
    报名情况极为热烈。中央美术学院在公布开始报名后，马上就有不少人等在报名处门口。人民印刷厂女工耿芝亚在开始报名的那一天，夜里三点钟就起来了，洗着衣服等赶早去报名。
    青年学生、青年工人，都是抱着与美帝国主义和国民党匪帮作殊死斗争的决心报了名的。燕京大学学生夏定官报名以后，就在毛主席像前宣誓：“我参加人民海军，决心将蒋匪帮赶出台湾去！”辅仁大学学生彭守庆报名后激动地说：“我希望在这个伟大的行列里，与美帝国主义作顽强的斗争，以争取加入新民主主义青年团。”但是报了名的学生、工人，也都作了充分的思想准备：如果不能被批准，便将和没有能报上名的学生、工人一样，留下来努力学习，加紧生产，积极参加抗美援朝运动。
    现在各大、中学校和工厂，正积极准备欢送。
