Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th. The New York Worker's Daily published on December 3rd a letter from Dennis, General Secretary of the American Communist Party, written to his wife from prison, discussing "Why the Chinese People Aid Korea." These letters were sent from November 10th to 16th.

    In the letter, Dennis stated: "The Chinese People's Volunteers are helping a friendly and heroic neighbor and a sovereign and freedom-loving people to repel the brutal aggression of imperialism. They are defending the integrity and security of their own border territory because the same armed forces that are slaughtering the Korean people have barbarously violated the integrity and security of their territory with their aggressive actions. Therefore, the actions of the Chinese People's Volunteers embody the finest traditional spirit of international solidarity of all freedom-loving people, and their actions are for self-defense and for peace."

    Dennis wrote: "The real question is not what the Chinese People's Volunteers are doing in Korea, but what the United States and its allies are doing there, on the Manchurian border, in Taiwan, and elsewhere?"

    The letter pointed out: "All the speculation about the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, the provocative 'analyses' in the newspapers, and the State Department's propaganda tactics may deceive a few people, but a simple yet profound fact is that as long as imperialism exists, there will be people who oppose imperialism; wherever there is imperialist aggression, there will be resistance to aggression, there will be people fighting for freedom, and those who have already gained freedom will fight to defend their freedom.

    "Korea is not Greece, and most importantly, liberated China is not the old Qing Dynasty China, nor is it Chiang Kai-shek's China. The victory of New China is a historic victory and an irreversible victory. As a New Democratic country and a powerful force in the growing world camp of peace, democracy, and socialism led by the Soviet Union, liberated China not only hopes to defend its borders, protect its sovereignty, and handle its own affairs in its own way, but free China is fully capable of doing all this."

    但尼斯论中国人民援朝
    “只要有帝国主义的侵略行动，就会有抵抗侵略的行动。”
    【新华社布拉格七日电】十二月三日纽约工人日报刊载美国共产党总书记但尼斯从监狱中写给他妻子的信，其中论及“中国人民为何援助朝鲜”。这些信是十一月十日到十六日发的。
    但尼斯在信中称：“中国人民志愿军正在帮助一个友好而英勇的邻国及享有主权和爱好自由的人民击退帝国主义的残暴侵略。他们正在保卫他们本国边境领土的完整和安全，因为屠杀朝鲜人民的同一武装部队，已经以其侵略行动横蛮无理地侵犯了他们的领土的完整和安全。因此，中国人民志愿军的行动，具有所有爱好自由人民的国际休戚与共的最优秀的传统精神，他们的行动是为了自卫，是为了和平。”
    但尼斯写道：“真正的问题不是中国人民志愿军正在朝鲜作什么，而是美国及其盟国的军队正在那里满洲边境、在台湾和在其他地方作什么？”
    信中指出：“关于在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军的一切揣测，各报挑衅性的‘分析’以及国务院的宣传方针，可能蒙蔽少数人民，但是一个很简单却很深刻的事实是：只要帝国主义存在一天，就会有反对帝国主义的人民；只要有帝国主义的侵略行动，就会有抵抗侵略的行动，就会有为争取自由而斗争的人民，而已经获得自由的人民就会斗争以保卫他们的自由。
    “朝鲜不是希腊，最为重要的是，解放了的中国不是过去的满清中国，也不是蒋介石的中国。新中国的胜利，是一个历史性的胜利，也是一个不可更改的胜利。作为一个新民主主义国家、在以苏联为首的日益壮大的世界和平、民主与社会主义阵营中的一支强大的力量，解放了的中国不仅希望保卫它的边境，保卫它的主权并以自己的方式解决本国的事务，而且自由中国完全能够作到这一切。”
