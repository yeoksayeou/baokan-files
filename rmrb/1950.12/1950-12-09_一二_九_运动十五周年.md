Fifteenth Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement
    Xu Deheng

Fifteen years ago, the "December 9th" Movement launched by Chinese youth was the greatest movement in Chinese revolutionary history after the May Fourth Movement, and also one of the greatest movements in the history of the Chinese people's liberation movement in the past century.

In the autumn of 1935, after the Japanese imperialists achieved rapid success in annexing the Northeast, occupying Jehol, and invading eastern Hebei, they attempted to further invade the entire territory of North China. Their method was to support those who feared Japan, spread the fallacies of the theory of weapons and the theory of China's destruction in three days, buy off pro-Japanese traitors, collude with the Wang Jingwei Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government, and oppress the Chinese people to establish a puppet regime. The "Hebei-Chahar Political Council" at that time was an organization of a puppet regime following "Manchukuo" and "Eastern Hebei." The emergence of this "Hebei-Chahar Political Council" was facilitated by He Yingqin, the traitor who signed the "He-Umezu Agreement." He, following Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, further concluded three conditions for "adjusting Sino-Japanese relations" with the Japanese invaders outside the "Hebei-Chahar Political Council": First, ban anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese activities; Second, China and Japan jointly fight against communism and suppress the Red Army together; Third, establish Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo economic relations and jointly develop the North China economy. At that time, China was in imminent danger; the people's hearts were extremely indignant, and the situation was extremely dark and terrifying!

It was at this moment that patriotic youth students in Peiping and Tianjin raised the great banner of the Chinese people's anti-Japanese movement – the "December 9th" Movement.

As soon as this movement started, it received enthusiastic responses from youth all over the country and a broad range of patriots. Cultural and educational workers in Peiping and Tianjin organized the "Cultural Circles National Salvation Association" and the "Peiping Cultural Workers Association." In Shanghai, led by veteran Ma Xiangbo and Mr. Lu Xun, they issued the "National Salvation Movement Declaration." They all unanimously and resolutely demanded the integrity of territorial sovereignty and called on the people of the whole country to organize and take effective actions to save the country and resist foreign aggression.

At the same time, as soon as this movement started, it was subjected to bloody suppression by the reactionary government at the time. Progressive teachers, students, and patriots were constantly disappearing and being arrested; the masses of young people marching and petitioning were beaten with water cannons, broadswords, and rifle butts, their heads bleeding. The traitorous Nanjing government wanted to use this method to curry favor with their masters, offer their diligence, and maintain their reactionary regime. The Japanese invaders also wanted to use the method of supporting the reactionary regime and buying off traitors and special agents to destroy China. Under the call of the Chinese Communist Party's "August 1st Declaration," under the sacred banner of "uniting to resist foreign aggression and jointly fight against Japan," the Chinese people finally united closely and launched an unprecedented national war of resistance. As a result of this action, it was confirmed that it was not others who were going to be destroyed, but the imperialist Japanese invaders themselves! It was precisely the national traitors, traitors, reactionaries, and pro-Japanese cliques who were waiting to be destroyed!

Today, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have basically overthrown the feudal rule of more than two thousand years, the imperialist rule of more than a hundred years, and the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for more than twenty years, and established their own country. The Chinese people have truly stood up, which cannot but be traced back to the achievements of the "December 9th" Movement. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang regime, aided and sheltered by the US imperialists, was defeated on the mainland, they were unwilling to give up and wanted to imitate the Japanese imperialists, taking direct action to launch the war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time, armed intervention in our country's liberation of Taiwan, constantly invading our country's airspace and territorial waters, bombing various places in Northeast China and Shandong, massacring our people, and burning the flames of war to our borders. Chairman Mao pointed out as early as June 1949 in the preparatory meeting of the CPPCC that "the imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat on Chinese soil. They will still collude with each other and use all possible methods to oppose the Chinese people; ... if they still want to take risks, it is not impossible to send a part of their forces to harass China's borders." He also reminded us: "They will attempt to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and there is no doubt about it. We must not relax our vigilance."

Today, when the US imperialists are carrying out armed aggression against us, as we commemorate this great and glorious "December 9th" Movement, a historical anti-imperialist struggle, first, we must recognize that "Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea" is a sacred task for every Chinese person today, and the importance of this task is the same as resisting Japan during the "December 9th" period. We once united under the call of "uniting to resist foreign aggression and jointly fight against Japan" and drove the Japanese imperialists out of China. Now, we must further strengthen our unity, redouble our efforts, implement the resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, and defeat this last imperialist aggressor. We know that resisting US aggression and aiding Korea today means protecting our homes and defending our country. This meaning has already been made very clear in the joint declaration of the democratic parties on November 4th. If the US imperialist aggression is not stopped, not only will the construction of the new China not be able to proceed smoothly, but also the brilliant achievements we have gained in the anti-imperialist war since the "December 9th" will be reduced to "failure for lack of a final effort."

Second, we must understand that in order to complete the sacred task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and defending our homes and protecting our country, it is essential to further develop and strengthen our national defense forces. We remember that during the "December 9th" Movement, in order to strengthen the people's anti-Japanese combat power, Chinese youth organized the National Liberation Vanguard and went deep into the countryside to arm themselves. Due to the formation of this National Liberation Vanguard, the strength of the rear guerrilla forces during the War of Resistance Against Japan was strengthened. Now, to deal with the aggression of the US imperialists, it is not only necessary to rely solely on a brave and skilled army, but also to have a strong people's air force and people's navy. In order to build a naval and air defense and cultivate new military talents, the Central People's Government has opened various military cadre schools to recruit young students and young workers; patriotic young friends across the country, on the occasion of commemorating the "December 9th" Movement, should further promote the spirit of the "National Liberation Vanguard" of that year, enthusiastically respond to this great call, actively participate in the study of military cadre schools, lay a solid foundation for naval and air defense construction, and defeat the aggression of US imperialism.

Third, in today's torrent of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, defending our homes and protecting our country, there are undoubtedly still a few people who do not have a sufficient understanding of the US imperialists, those who "fear the US" and those who hold to the "theory of weapons." As mentioned earlier, during the "December 9th" Movement, there were also a small number of national scum who were pro-Japanese, and those who had unclear understanding, those who "feared Japan" and those who were "theory of weapons." History has very clearly told us, what kind of ending did those "pro-Japanese" national dregs eventually get? This is a very good lesson for today, fifteen years later, in the voice of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Of course, for those who have unclear understanding, those who "fear the US," and those who hold to the "theory of weapons," we must carry out patient and in-depth persuasion and education based on the ironclad facts.

The "December 9th" Movement is now fifteen years old! On this day, fifteen years later, the Chinese people will absolutely not allow any imperialists to invade the country they have fought for and established with their own blood. The Chinese people, united under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong, can defeat any imperialists who invade us. We can solemnly tell all the warmongers, if you dare to try it, the fate of Hitler and Tojo Hideki is waiting for you!

    “一二·九”运动十五周年
    许德珩
    十五年前，中国青年所发动的“一二·九”运动，是五四运动以后中国革命史上一个最伟大的运动，也是近百年来中国人民解放运动史上一个最伟大的运动。
    一九三五年秋，日本帝国主义者于吞并东北、占领热河、侵略冀东获得了很快的成功以后，就企图进一步的来侵略整个的华北领土。他所用的方法是扶植恐日分子，散布唯武器论及三天灭亡中国的谬论，收买亲日派汉奸，勾结汪精卫蒋介石卖国政府，压迫中国人民来进行汉奸政权之建立。当时的“冀察政务委员会”就是继“伪满”“冀东”之后的一个汉奸政权的组织，促成这个“冀察政务委员会”之出现的，是“何梅协定”的签订者卖国贼何应钦，他秉承蒋贼的意旨，于“冀察政务委员会”之外，更与日寇订立了所谓“调整中日关系”的三个条件：一、取缔抗日排日，二、中日共同防共，共同剿赤；三、树立中、日、满三国经济关系，共同开发华北经济。当时中国是岌岌可危；人心是极端愤慨，局面是异常黑暗与恐怖的！
    就在这个时候，平津的爱国青年学生，举起了中国人民抗日运动的大旗——“一二·九”运动。
    这个运动一开始，就得到了全国各地青年及广大的爱国人士热烈的响应。平津文教工作者就组织了“文化界救国会”和“北平文化工作者协会”。上海以九六老人马相伯和鲁迅先生等为首，发表了“救国运动宣言”。他们都一致的、坚决地要求领土主权完整，号召全国人民组织起来，采取有效的行动，救国御侮。
    同时，这个运动一开始，也就受到了当时反动政府血腥的压迫。进步的教员、学生、爱国人士，不断的失踪被捕；游行请愿的青年群众，被水龙、大刀、枪托，打得头破血流，卖国的南京政府想用这样的方法来向他们的主子邀功、献殷勤、维持他们的反动政权，日寇也想用扶植反动政权，收买汉奸特务的方法来灭亡中国。中国人民在中国共产党“八一”宣言的号召之下，在“团结御侮，共同抗日”这个神圣的旗帜之下，终于紧密地团结起来，发动了空前未有的民族抗战。由于这一行动的结果，证实了要灭亡的不是别人，而是帝国主义者日寇自身！待毁灭的也正不是别人，而是国贼、汉奸、反动派、亲日派那班家伙自己！
    今天，中国人民在自己的英明领袖毛主席及中国共产党正确的领导之下，基本上把二千多年的封建统治，百多年的帝国主义统治，二十多年蒋匪帮的反动统治推翻了，建立了人民自己的国家，中国人民真正的站立起来了，这不能不溯源到“一二·九”运动的成就。美帝国主义者于他所帮助所卵翼的蒋匪帮政权在大陆上被打垮以后，还不甘心，又想效法日本帝国主义，亲自动起手来，发动侵朝战争，同时武装干涉我国解放台湾，不断的侵入我国的领空领海，轰炸我东北山东各地，屠杀我国人民，把战火烧到了我们的国境。毛主席早在一九四九年六月政协筹备会中，就指出“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派，对于他们在中国土地上的失败是不会甘心的，他们还会互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法反对中国人民；……假如他们还想冒险的话，派出一部分兵力侵扰中国的边境，也不是不可能的。”他并且还提醒我们说：“他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟，这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈了自己的警惕性。”
    今天，在美帝武装侵略我们的今天，我们来纪念历史上反帝斗争这一伟大的、光荣的“一二·九”运动，第一、我们就要认清“抗美援朝”是我们每一个中国人民当前的一个神圣任务，这一任务的重要，也同于“一二·九”时期的抗日；我们当年曾经在“团结御侮，共同抗日”的号召之下，团结起来，驱逐了日本帝国主义出中国，现在，我们更要加紧的团结，加倍的努力，实行抗美援朝，打垮这最后一个帝国主义者的侵略。我们晓得，今日的抗美援朝就是保家卫国，这个意义，十一月四日各民主党派的联合宣言中，已经是讲得很明白的，美帝的侵略不制止，新中国的建设事业不惟不能顺利的进行，就是我们“一二·九”以来反帝战争所获得的光辉成就，也就要成为“功亏一篑”。
    第二、我们要晓得，为着完成抗美援朝、保家卫国这一神圣任务，进一步的发展并加强我们的国防力量是切要的。我们记得在“一二·九”运动当时，中国青年为着加强人民抗日的战斗力量，曾经组织了民族解放先锋队，深入农村，武装自己。由于这一民族解放先锋队之组成，就加强了抗日战争时期后方游击部队的力量。现在对付美帝的侵略，不仅是专靠英勇善战的陆军，还要有一支强大的人民空军和人民海军。为着海空的国防建设，培养新的军事人材起见，中央人民政府开办了各种军事干部学校招收青年学生及青年工人入学；全国爱国的青年朋友们，在纪念“一二·九”运动的今天，更应当发挥当年“民族解放先锋队”的精神，热烈的响应这一伟大的号召，踊跃的参加军事干部学校的学习，为海空国防建设奠定一个结实的基础，打垮美帝的侵略。
    第三、在今天这一抗美援朝、保家卫国的洪流中，无疑的，还存在着少数对美帝认识不够的“恐美”和“唯武器论”的分子；这在“一二·九”运动当时，如前面所讲过的，也曾经有过一小撮民族败类的亲日分子、和认识不清的“恐日分子”“唯武器论者”。历史很清楚的告诉了我们，那些“亲日”的民族渣滓，到后来得到了怎样的收场？这是十五年后的今天，抗美援朝声中一个很好的前鉴。当然，对于认识不清的“恐美”分子，“唯武器论者”，我们是要从铁的事实中，进行耐心的、深入的说服与教育。
    “一二·九”运动到现在已经十五年了！在这十五年后的今日，中国人民用自己的鲜血争取并建立起来了的国家，是绝不容许再有任何帝国主义者之侵略的。团结在中国共产党和毛泽东旗帜之下的中国人民，是可以打败任何一个侵略我们的帝国主义者的。我们可以正告一切的战争贩子们，若果你们敢于尝试一下的话，希特勒、东条英机的下场，是在等待着你们的！
