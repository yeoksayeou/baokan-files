The Reconstructed Nan Jingse Village Cooperative in Lin County

Nan Jingse is the general name for five natural villages in Lin County, Pingyuan Province: Donggang, Hegou, Nangang, Jingquan, and Shuinanyu. It has a total of 362 households, 1,766 people, and 3,563 mu of land. The local produce mainly consists of millet, wheat, sesame, and hemp seeds. Due to the scarcity of land and dense population, there is a general shortage of food; in particular, there is a greater lack of daily necessities and means of production such as salt, kerosene, and agricultural tools.

Establishment, Transformation and Growth of the Village Cooperative

In 1945, Nan Jingse established a cooperative with households as shareholders. Initially, the village cooperative only sold some oil, salt, and sundry goods, but later gradually opened an oil mill, a pharmacy, and a dyeing workshop. It had a total of fifteen employees. Over the years, it has played a certain role in adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, supplying the people with means of production and daily life, and leading production and disaster relief. However, due to profit sharing based on shares and the sole pursuit of profits without a clear service target, it has consistently failed to fulfill the task of reducing intermediary exploitation.

After the county's cooperative conference last year, the branch began to develop supply and marketing cooperative members in the village (the old cooperative was retained without transformation). At that time, more than 600 members were developed, and the members' shares were all submitted to the branch. The branch supplied some daily necessities such as salt and kerosene every month. After more than half a year, thanks to the support of the branch, the members benefited and had a preliminary understanding of the supply and marketing cooperative. This spring, the village held a Party branch village cadre meeting to study the transformation of the village cooperative. After the masses understood the nature and purpose of the supply and marketing cooperative, they decided to transform the original old cooperative. At that time, the following difficulties were estimated in the transformation work: (1) The supply and marketing cooperative is a new thing. If the masses are mobilized but not clearly explained, the old cooperative may not only fail to improve but may even collapse; (2) The fifteen employees have a large expenditure. If the doors are opened for rectification, the employees' meals alone will consume thousands of catties of millet; (3) The old cooperative shares are extremely uneven, and profit calculation is troublesome; at the same time, long-term surplus shares may be dispersed due to the transformation. Based on the above estimates, a village people's representative conference was held for detailed study; and it was decided to conduct discussions in separate groups and areas at meal times; vigorously publicize the nature of the supply and marketing cooperative, and compare the two cooperatives with facts. It was found that the masses had many concerns during the deliberation: some said, "The supply and marketing cooperative will become state-owned in the future." Others said, "It will take at least half a month to close the doors and settle accounts, and the meals of the fifteen people will eat up our shares." In response to these concerns, cadres and representatives held another meeting to study and finally made the following resolutions: (1) Business as usual during the transformation; (2) Conduct in-depth publicity to explain that the source of dividends is the exploitation of the masses; (3) Party members and cadres take the lead in joining the cooperative; (4) Combine with business to make the masses recognize the benefits of the supply and marketing cooperative in terms of realistic interests; (5) The surplus shares of the old cooperative can be deposited into the new cooperative at a monthly interest rate of two percent for credit savings. This resolution was implemented and quickly won the support of the broad masses. During the publicity, the new members were also distributed 1,500 catties of salt (two catties per person), two boxes of matches, and some coal at prices lower than the market price. The masses saw the benefits of the supply and marketing cooperative with their own eyes, so they asked to join the cooperative. At that time, it was stipulated that each share was worth ten catties of millet, and a total of 1,030 members were developed, absorbing 10,300 catties of shares; and 23 members' representatives and 9 cooperative affairs committee members were democratically elected, and a democratic meeting system was established; the members' meeting was held once every three months, the representative meeting was held once every twenty days, and the cooperative affairs committee was held once every ten days. At the same time, the workshops attached to the old cooperative were also merged into the new cooperative according to the needs of the members.

Promoting Democracy, Handling Credit, and Carrying out Supply and Marketing

After the transformation of the village cooperative, most of the 10,300 catties of share capital were occupied by furniture, mills, and livestock, leaving almost no working capital; therefore, the village cooperative carried out credit, widely absorbing idle funds to solve its own capital difficulties. From the time of the transformation in April to mid-August, a total of 17,800 catties of millet were absorbed, including 8,000 catties of long-term shares from the old cooperative, 5,300 catties of grain deposited by workers in the village, and 500 catties of grain deposited by the masses without interest. It was stipulated that no interest would be paid for deposits within five days, a monthly interest rate of one percent for those over five days, a monthly interest rate of one and a half percent for two to three months, and a monthly interest rate of two percent for those over three months. Of the stored grain, 5,000 catties were lent to the masses at an interest rate of five percent higher, and in addition to purchasing livestock and agricultural tools, the rest were used as working capital.

In terms of business operations, the village cooperative completely changed its past operating methods of not serving members and simply pursuing profits, and achieved democratic management. The methods are:

(1) Daily necessities are wholesaled by the branch every month, and a fixed quantity is distributed to members at a time. The distribution price is based on cost, freight, and damage, without controlling profits (a certain profit should be controlled).

(2) Other supplies of daily life and means of production, such as cloth and agricultural tools. According to the principle of priority and preferential treatment for members; controlling small profits. When there is surplus capacity, transactions are also carried out with non-members at market prices, such as a family of five, two of whom are members, buying five catties of oil, then two catties are at preferential prices and three catties are at market prices.

(3) When purchasing agricultural and sideline products, there is no price difference between members and non-members (priority for members should be emphasized).

(4) Some special items. The members' representatives often deliberate and count at meal times, and then the cooperative affairs committee studies; according to the origin price, specifications, quality, transportation conditions, and its own strength, those that can be done are implemented, otherwise, it is explained to the members to avoid capital occupation and affecting the relationship between the cooperative and the members.

From the transformation of the village cooperative in early April to mid-August, according to statistics, the total supply and marketing value was equivalent to 289,120 catties of millet. The reduction of intermediary exploitation was about 7,000 catties of millet or more, and the members benefited from transportation by 9,300 catties. The vast majority of the operating items are those of the members, which basically meet the diverse needs of the members. At the same time, the village cooperative accumulated more than 6,000 catties of millet, increasing public property.

Strengthening Accounting, Developing Chain Contract Management

Since the establishment of the village supply and marketing cooperative, it has achieved remarkable results in contract management, especially chain contracts, which is a new creation. Below are several important examples of chain contracts:

1. The village cooperative signed a contract with the Dazhong Coal Mine to exchange 4,000 catties of leather oil for 10,000 catties of millet from the mine. The mine uses coal to offset millet payments, with a preferential rate of 15 baskets for every 100 baskets. The oil delivery period is three months, guaranteed by the branch. The coal can be taken out in advance. At the same time, the village cooperative agreed with the stone burning group and all the members of the village cooperative, explaining the preferential coal use method and organizing the members to fetch coal from the coal mine. The members can directly hand over the grain to the village cooperative. As a result of this chain contract management, the members obtained cheap coal, the village cooperative reduced the labor of transporting rice, and the mine obtained the convenience of zero-use oil and reduced the trouble and damage of storage.

2. The village cooperative signed a contract with the Linqi Branch to purchase hemp seeds and sesame, and the village cooperative directly purchased from the surrounding villages of the Linqi Branch. At that time, the masses were not given cash or grain, but only a note. The masses held the note to the Jingse Village Cooperative and could pick up sea salt from the Linqi Branch at any time (at that time, one catty and four taels of hemp seeds were exchanged for one catty of salt, while the market price was one catty and five taels). After a certain period, the Nan Jingse Village Cooperative and the Linqi Branch settled accounts according to the note. As a result of this operation, the village cooperative purchased a large amount of oil at a low price, the masses sold their local products, and the Linqi Branch sold a large amount of sea salt.

3. The village cooperative used 6,650 catties of oil cake and signed a contract with the Yao Village Branch to exchange 3,000 catties of millet. The cake was sent to Lin County; the Yao Village Branch allocated 3,000 catties of rice, which was to be sent to the Dazhong Coal Mine for frame wood, to the Nan Jingse Village Cooperative. The village cooperative agreed with the mine and turned the rice into coal; and introduced members to fetch coal. The members can directly hand over the grain to the village cooperative.

4. Fifteen consecutive contracts were signed with Datong, Hengfeng, and Ruixing oil firms in Anyang City. All are advance payments, and oil is delivered on a regular basis (ten days or eight days). After the currency is withdrawn, it is immediately organized for turnover; or salt is bought back from the salt company, or daily necessities are bought from other places. The oil delivery time does not arrive until after the sale. Sometimes the first contract has not yet ended, and the second and third contracts have already been signed. This continuous chain of operations greatly accelerated the turnover of funds and overcame the difficulties of funds.

The above are several major contract operations. In addition, the village cooperative also opened a transfer business. For example, 240 straw hats, 180 hoe blades, and 20 hoe hooks were purchased from Changzhi at one time, worth about 6,000 catties of millet. It was entirely bought with the wages of the workers from this county working in Shanxi. After selling them, they will be returned to the workers' families. From the above contracts and transfer operations, it can be seen that the business of the Nan Jingse Village Cooperative is carried out under the principle of careful calculation and saving funds.

Several Experiences and Suggestions for Improvement

1. Correctly grasping policies, the Party branch's active leadership, and giving full play to the role of the representative meeting are important keys to the transformation, consolidation, and development of the cooperative. In-depth publicity, understanding the needs of the masses, combining with business, cashing on the spot, and implementing democracy are the fundamental methods of transforming the cooperative. When Nan Jingse transformed, it paid attention to introducing the old cooperative's funds into the new cooperative, and united several villages to build a cooperative, which can concentrate funds, expand operations, and improve various democratic systems, which is very good. This experience should be promoted in the future rectification of grassroots cooperatives.

2. Taking the mass line in operation, doing everything possible to meet the specifications, quality, and numbers required by the members, not only strengthens the relationship between the cooperative and the members, but also does not cause capital occupation and meets the diverse needs of the members, which is a major advancement in business. However, a certain profit must still be controlled for the distribution of necessities to members.

3. Handling credit, creating and developing various contract operations, and vigorously organizing material exchanges have overcome the difficulties of funds and ensured the development of supply and marketing business. This is an important method for the operation of grassroots cooperatives and is worth learning. In particular, chain contracts should be vigorously promoted in rural areas in the future.

4. The village cooperative has a large organization with as many as fifteen employees, which will undoubtedly increase expenses. Under the current circumstances, whether this is in line with the spirit of fixed personnel and quotas, and whether it is needed by the members, still needs to be specifically studied and improved by the local county cooperative and branch.

    改造后的林县南景色村合作社
    南景色是平原省林县东岗、河沟、南岗、井泉、水南峪五个自然村的总称，共三百六十二户，一千七百六十六人，土地三千五百六十三亩。当地出产以小米、麦子、芝麻、大麻籽为主。因地少人稠，食粮一般缺乏；特别是食盐、煤油、农具等生活、生产资料更感缺乏。
    村社的建立，改造与成长
    一九四五年，南景色以户为单位集股成立了合作社。最初村合作社只卖些油盐杂货，后来逐渐又开设了一个油坊，一个药铺，一个染房。共有职工十五人。数年来，调剂有无，对于群众生产生活资料的供给，以及领导生产救灾，都曾起过一定的作用。但是由于按股分红，单纯追逐利润，没有明确的服务对象，所以始终未能执行减除中间剥削的任务。
    去年全县合作会议后，分社便着手在该村发展供销社员（旧社仍然保留，未加改造），当时共发展社员六百多人，社员股金，全部交往分社，每月由分社供给些食盐、煤油等生活用品。这样经过半年多的时间，由于分社的支持，社员得到了实惠，对供销社有了初步的认识。今春村上召开了支部村干会，研究村社的改造问题。群众认识了供销社的性质与目的以后，便决心对原有旧社进行改造。当时对改造工作曾估计有如下困难：（一）供销社是个新东西，把群众发动起来，如果向群众讲不清楚，旧社不但不能搞好可能还会搞垮；（二）十五个职工，开支很大，如开门整顿，仅职工吃饭就需耗费小米数千斤；（三）旧社股金极不平均，利润计算麻烦；同时长余股金，可能会因改造而分散。根据以上估计，又召开了村人代会详细研究；并决定分头、分片，在饭市上酝酿讨论；大力宣传供销社的性质，将两种社用事实来作对比说明。发现群众在酝酿当中，有很多顾虑：有的说：“供销社将来都成了公家的了。”有的说：“关门算账，至少得半月时间，光十五个人吃饭就把咱的股吃光了。”根据这些顾虑，干部、代表又开会研究，最后作出如下决议：（一）在改造中照常营业；（二）深入宣传，说明红利的来源是剥削群众；（三）党员干部带头入社；（四）结合业务，使群众在现实利益上认识供销社的好处；（五）旧社多余股金可按信用储蓄月息二分存入新社。这一决议贯彻下去，迅速取得了广大群众的拥护。在宣传当中，同时又低于市价配售新社员食盐一五○○斤（每人二斤），火柴两箱，煤炭一部，群众亲眼看到供销社的好处，于是纷纷要求入社。当时规定每股分股金米十斤，共发展社员一千零三十人，吸收股金一万零三百斤；并民主选举了社员代表二十三人，社务委员九人，民主订出了会议制度；社员大会三个月召开一次，代表会二十天开会一次，社务委员会十天一次。同时旧社附设的作坊，根据社员需要也并入到新社里来。
    发扬民主办理信贷开展供销
    村社改造后，股金米一万零三百斤大部为家俱、碾榨、牲口等占用，几无周转资金；因此村社便开展了信贷，广泛的吸收游资，来解决本身资金的困难。从四月改造时起到八月中旬，计吸收旧社长期股金小米八千斤，本村工人存米五千三百斤，群众无利存粮五百斤，共一万七千八百斤。并规定存五天以内不计息，五天以上者月息一分，两月至三月月息一分五厘，三月以上者月息二分。所收存粮以高五厘的利息贷给群众五千斤，购买牲口农具外，其他均当成周转资金。
    在业务经营上，村社完全改变了过去不服务社员，单纯追逐利润的经营方式，做到了民主经营。其办法：
    （１）生活日用必需品，每月由分社批发，一次定量配售给社员。配售价格，按成本、运费、伤耗，不掌握利润（应掌握一定利润）。
    （２）其他生活生产资料的供应，如布匹、农具等。根据社员优先优待办法；掌握薄利。有富余力量时，按市场价格也与非社员交易，如一家五口人，二人入社，购油五斤，则二斤按优待价格，三斤按市场价格。
    （３）在收购农副业产品时，社员与非社员价格不分（应强调社员优先）。
    （４）一些特殊物品。由社员代表经常在饭市上酝酿统计，再经社委会研究；根据产地价格、规格、质量、运输条件、本身力量，能办者便执行，否则即向社员解释，以免资金占压和影响社与社员的关系。
    自四月初村社改造到八月中旬，据统计，供销总值折小米二十八万九千一百二十斤。减除中间剥削约在七千斤小米以上，社员运输得利九千三百斤。经营物品绝大部分是社员的，基本上满足了社员多种多样的要求。同时村社积累小米六千多斤，增大了公共财产。
    加强计算开展连锁合同经营
    村供销社成立以来，在合同经营上获得了显著的成绩，特别是连锁合同是一个新创造。下面是几个重要连锁合同例子：
    一、村社与大众煤矿订立合同，用皮油四、○○○斤，交换矿方小米一○、○○○斤。矿方用煤作成小米抵交，每百筐优待十五筐。交油期限三月，由分社作保。煤可以提前取出。村社、同时又与社员烧石小组，以及全村社员协议，说明用煤优待办法，组织社员向煤矿取煤，社员将粮食可直接交往村社。这一连锁合同经营的结果，社员得到了廉价用煤，村社减省了运米脚力，矿方得到了零用油的方便，并减少了保管的麻烦和伤耗。
    二、村社与临淇分社订立收购大麻籽、芝麻合同，由村社到临淇分社周围村社直接收购，当时并不时群众现款或粮食，只是给群众开一条据，群众持给景色村社条子，随时可到临淇分社取回海盐（当南是一斤四两麻籽换盐一斤，而市价须一斤五两）。到一定时期，南景色村社和临淇分社按条算账。这样经营的结果，村社廉价收购了大批的油料，群众推销了自己的土产，临淇分社推销了大批海盐。
    三、村社用油饼六千六百五十斤，与姚村分社订交换小米三千斤的合同。饼送到林县城；姚村分社将送交大众煤矿的架木，作米三千斤，拨给南景色村社。村社与矿方协议，又将米作成煤；并介绍社员前往取煤。社员将粮食可直接交往村社。
    四、与安阳市大同、恒丰、瑞兴各油行连续订立十五次合同。均是预支货币，定期交油（十天或八天）。在货币取出后立即组织周转；或从盐业公司买回食盐，或从其他地方买成日用品。待销售后才到交油时间。有时第一次合同还未结束，第二次第三次合同又已订妥。这样连环不断的经营，大大加速了资金周转，克服了资金的困难。
    以上是几宗主要的合同经营。另外村社还开办了兑拨业务。如一次从长治买草帽二百四十个，锄板一百八十个，锄钩二十个，约值小米六千斤。完全是集合本县在山西做工的工资买来的。回来推销后，再归还工人家属。从以上合同、兑拨经营中，可以看出南景色村社的业务都是在精打细算，节省资金的原则下开展的。
    几点经验与改进意见
    一、正确的掌握政策，支部的积极领导，与充分发挥代表会的作用，是改造、巩固、发展合作社的重要关键。深入宣传，了解群众要求，结合业务，当场兑现，实行民主，是改造社的根本方法。南景色在改造时，注意把旧社资金引入新社，作到数村联合建社，并能集中资金，扩大经营，健全各种民主制度，这是很好的。这一经验，应当在今后整顿基层社工作中加以推广。
    二、经营上走群众路线，一切都根据社员要求的规格，质量数字，尽力办好，既密切了社与社员的关系，又不致使资金占压，满足了社员多种多样的要求，这是业务上的一大进步。不过对于社员必需品的配售，还须掌握一定利润。
    三、办理信贷，创造与开展了各种合同经营，大力组织物资交流，克服了资金困难，保证了供销业务的发展，这是基层社经营的重要方法，是值得学习的。特别是连锁合同，今后在农村中更应大力推广。
    四、村社机构庞大，职工达十五人，无疑会增大开支，在目前情况下，这样是否合乎定员定额精神，是否为社员所需要，还是需要当地县社、分社具体研究帮助改进的。
