    A New Era for Ethnic Minorities in Southwestern China
    — On the First All-Circles People's Representative Conference of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province
    By Our Correspondent Accompanying the Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group, Shen Shi
    The First All-Circles People's Representative Conference of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province was held on November 17th and concluded victoriously on the 24th.

    This conference marks the great unity of the Tibetan, Han, Yi, and Hui nationalities in the Kangding area of Xikang Province, and also the great unity within the Tibetan nationality. The entire conference was filled with an atmosphere of unity, friendship, and cooperation. This is a new phenomenon that has emerged for the first time in the Tibetan-inhabited areas of Xikang Province for thousands of years. Representatives of all strata of the Tibetan people in the entire Kangding area gathered together with representatives of the Han, Yi, and Hui nationalities to discuss major issues concerning all ethnic groups in the region in accordance with the ethnic policies of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), to establish an autonomous regional people's government, and to formulate future work tasks. This is the first time in the history of Tibetan development.

    "We must make this conference a success," the representatives participating in and presiding over the conference put forward this solemn slogan. They followed the slogan step by step, and they ensured the realization of this slogan. How to make the conference a complete success, how to make the representatives feel satisfied with the conference, how to make the representatives feel comfortable in their lives under the existing economic conditions in the region, and how to make the representatives realize the importance of unity between various ethnic groups and within the Tibetan nationality were all issues that all comrades involved in the preparation of the conference, especially Miao Fengshu, Director of the Kangding Military Control Commission, Fan Zhizhong, Commander of the Military Sub-district, Sangji Yexi (Tianbao), Member, and Angwang Gesang, Secretary-General of the conference, had painstakingly considered. The universal response of the representatives that they "felt satisfied" shows that this conference was very successful.

    Who are the representatives attending the conference?

    This conference was convened by the Kangding Military Control Commission in accordance with the Common Program of the CPPCC and with the instructions and approval of the Southwest Military and Political Committee and the Xikang Provincial People's Government.

    There were 271 representatives attending the conference, including 180 Tibetans, 74 Hans, 12 Yis, and 5 Huis. The representatives included the Kangding Local Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Liberation Army, Kangding's various organizations and groups, workers, farmers, herdsmen, industrialists and businessmen, freelancers, Tusi, Tuqianhu, Tubaihu, headmen, and religious representatives. There were 15 Tusi, Tuqianhu, and Tubaihu, 89 headmen, and religious representatives including Living Buddhas, Khenpos, Gexis, and Lamas, including 20 from the Yellow Sect, 9 from the Red Sect, 5 from the Flower Sect, 2 from the White Sect, and 1 from the Black Sect.

    They are already united

    The high-pressure and divisive policies of the Kuomintang reactionaries caused estrangement between the Tibetan, Han, and Yi nationalities in this region and the unfortunate result of disunity within the Tibetan and Yi nationalities. Robbery, vendettas, armed fights, and feuds often occurred between various ethnic groups. For example, the Kongsa Tusi of Ganzi County and the Mashu Tusi had been at odds since the late Qing Dynasty. In 1938, the Kuomintang reactionaries single-handedly created the so-called Ganzi Incident, causing Dekin Wangmu, the Kongsa Tusi, to flee to Xining, Qinghai. The Kuomintang reactionaries took the opportunity to confiscate her family's land and entrusted it to the Mashu family for management, which further deepened the estrangement between the two families.

    Although the People's Government adhered to the policy of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups, some long-standing contradictions within the Tibetan and Yi nationalities had not been eliminated immediately due to the short time since liberation, and old grievances and feuds between some Tusi and headmen still existed. For example, after the liberation of Kangding, the Kongsa and Mashu families each sent representatives to Kangding to contact the Military Control Commission. Yixi Duoji, the representative of the Kongsa family, and Gongga Jiangze, the representative of the Mashu family, did not dare to travel together, always keeping a day's distance, fearing danger if they traveled together.

    At this conference, their relationship with each other was different from when they came to Kangding before. Yixi Duoji and Gongga Jiangze were both representatives, they could eat at the same table, they could sit together at the meeting, and Kongsa Yiduo was willing to translate for Gongga Jiangze when he spoke. They could also consult each other on matters. This was impossible during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, but it can be done today, which is undoubtedly a new phenomenon.

    Similarly, Ding Zeng, the representative of Ema Xiangzi, the chief steward of the Dege female Tusi Jiangyang Bomu, did not dare to come to Kangding alone to attend the meeting, fearing that she would encounter enemies on the road. After she came to Kangding in a military vehicle of our unit, at first, she did not dare to walk alone on the street, fearing retaliation from enemies. However, after a few days, Ding Zeng could walk alone on the street and attend the meeting confidently. This cannot but be said to be a new phenomenon.

    How did this new phenomenon appear? It should be affirmed that it is the harvest of patient and painstaking enlightenment and education by Director Miao Fengshu, Member Sangji Yexi, Commander Fan Zhizhong, and other comrades. After tireless explanations, persuasion, and seminars and group meetings on unity issues, the representatives initially understood the importance of unity between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups. They knew that under the leadership of the People's Government, there should not and could not be any more armed fights, vendettas, and feuds. They themselves also demanded unity and asked to formulate a unity and mutual assistance pact. They expressed their willingness to play an exemplary and leading role in unity. Riku Living Buddha, the representative of Kangding County, called on the representatives attending the meeting to jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of uniting all ethnic groups and guaranteed that there would be no problems in the temples under his jurisdiction. Kongsa Yiduo expressed his determination at the meeting to do a good job in unity and eliminate internal contradictions in the region.

    It should be pointed out that the estrangement between ethnic groups and within ethnic groups caused by the Kuomintang reactionaries cannot be eliminated overnight. These gains are just the torch that has just been lit in a marathon race. If we want to send the torch of unity to the final relay station, there is still a long process, a considerable amount of time, and a high degree of patience and perseverance as well as arduous and meticulous work required. However, Miao Fengshu, Sangji Yexi, Fan Zhizhong, Angwang Gesang, and other comrades who are determined to serve the Tibetan, Han, Yi, and Hui people are confident in making the Tibetan and Yi people as united as one family.

    To satisfy the representatives

    The representatives came from every corner of the Kangding area. Some of them had never been to the city, and some had never participated in such a meeting. How to make them gradually get used to sitting in the meeting hall for two or three hours, how to make them understand the set of procedures for holding meetings, how to make them feel that living in the guest house is more comfortable than living at home, all of these had to be carefully studied and planned in advance.

    All the personnel involved in the conference work served the representatives with great enthusiasm and a humble attitude. When the representatives did not know how to preside over various types of meetings, they assisted from the side. For those who had never spoken at a meeting, they tried every means to induce and encourage them to speak. For those who did not understand the rules of the meeting, they patiently told them. In a word, they tried to make the representatives learn a set of skills to preside over meetings so that they could take them back to their hometowns and teach them to the local residents.

    The most prominent feature of the conference was the expression of the Tibetan national form. Various documents and forms were printed in both Tibetan and Chinese. When Tibetan representatives spoke, they were translated into Chinese, and when Han representatives spoke, they were translated into Tibetan. The representative cards worn by the representatives, the rooms they lived in, and the kitchens and toilets were all marked in Tibetan. Although the oral translation comrades were exhausted, although the text translation comrades worked day and night, and although it took more time and effort in this regard, in short, it was to make the representatives understand.

    The Tibetan representatives attending the meeting had different lifestyles. The Living Buddhas and Lamas had to chant sutras in the morning, so the daily meetings were postponed to after 10:00 am. Female comrades were forbidden to enter the rooms of the Living Buddhas and Lamas, so male comrades were responsible for taking care of them. The furnishings in the rooms of the Tusi and headmen had to be different. The teapots and bowls were all made of fine porcelain. They were not used to eating rice, so they tried their best to provide butter, zanba, or pasta. They were not used to sitting on stools, so the seats in the meeting hall were thickly padded with wool. They had never seen a movie, so they held evening parties or showed movies every two or three days. They tried their best to take care of them, even if a representative's horse died, they had to care about it. Weng Jing Ding Zeng, the representative of Qungba Temple in Litang, was very sad when his beloved horse was killed by a yak on a cattle farm near Kangding. When the comrades in the guest house heard about it, they asked the Military Control Commission to negotiate with the owner of the cattle farm, and the owner of the cattle farm paid compensation. The working comrades of the guest house washed clothes for the representatives and served them food. Why? To satisfy the representatives and to make the representatives comfortable in their lives.

    "The great charter – the Common Program of the CPPCC – shines on us"

    Although the representatives attending the meeting came from cattle farms and remote mountainous areas, and although they said they had never seen a big "world," the simple Tibetan and Yi representatives had already shown their abilities during the meeting. Although they were unfamiliar with presiding over the meeting for the first time, they learned it after trying again and again.

    They knew that such a meeting was the first in the history of their nation. Riku Living Buddha said: "We can hold such a meeting today because the Common Program of the CPPCC – the great charter of the Chinese people – shines on us and gives our ethnic minorities a brilliant and splendid future."

    They knew that this meeting was related to their vital interests. They seriously discussed various proposals of the meeting and earnestly consulted on the selection of committee members and future work tasks. They put forward reasonable requests and suggestions based on the specific conditions of various places. Representatives from Danba requested the government to help supply tea seeds and rapeseed so that they could grow tea in the future in areas where they could not grow tea in the past. Tibetan representatives from Baiyu County requested the government to allow the local people to freely collect and transport salt in Waxiong, on the border of Qinghai and Xikang. In the past, the warlord Ma Bufang used slaughter to suppress the people of northern Kang from going to Waxiong to purchase salt, so that the common people had no salt to eat. Today, this tragic situation must be ended. Yi representatives from Luding requested the government to establish supply and marketing cooperatives in the county because there was no market in the county, and the Yi people had to purchase daily necessities from traveling merchants, which was a great loss.

    They demanded unity within the Tibetan and Yi nationalities. At the meeting, a resolution on the unity pact was adopted by the entire body, strictly prohibiting vendettas, robberies, armed fights, and feuds.

    They deeply knew that the People's Government cared for them and helped them. The Yi representatives said: "The Kuomintang reactionaries called us 'savages' and 'uncivilized people.' The People's Government truly treats us as 'people'."

    They thanked the working comrades for their hospitality. At the meeting, all the representatives expressed their gratitude with warm applause. Whether on the street or in public places, when they saw the comrades participating in the conference work, they raised their thumbs and said repeatedly: "Yamu! Yamu!" (Good! Good!) From their sincere emotions, we can know the gains of this conference.

    西南少数民族的新时代
    ——记西康省藏族自治区域第一届各界人民代表会议
    本报随中央西南各民族访问团记者  沈石
    西康省藏族自治区域第一届各界人民代表会议，于十一月十七日召开，二十四日胜利结束。
    这一会议标志着西康省康定地区藏、汉、彝、回四个民族的大团结，也标志着藏族内部的大团结，整个会议充满了团结、友爱、合作的气氛，这是千百年来西康省藏族聚居地区首次出现的新气象。全康定地区包括各阶层的藏族人民代表，聚集一堂，并和汉、彝、回族代表，按照政协共同纲领的民族政策，协商本地区有关各民族的大事，成立自治区域人民政府，制订今后的工作任务，这在藏族发展史上还是第一次。
    “必须使会议开好”，参加及主持会议的全体代表提出了这一庄严的口号，他们照着口号按步就班地去做，他们保证了这一口号的实现。怎样使会议开得圆满成功，怎样使代表们对会议感到满意，在本地区现有经济条件下，怎样使代表们生活上感到舒适，怎样使代表们认识到各个民族及藏族内部间团结的重要性，这些都是参与会议筹备工作全体同志、特别是康定军管会主任苗逢澍、军分区司令员樊执中、桑吉悦希（天宝）委员、大会秘书长昂旺格桑等所煞费苦心深思熟虑过的问题。从代表们“感到满意”的普遍反应中，说明了这次会议是十分成功的。
    那些代表出席会议？
    这一会议是按照政协共同纲领、经西南军政委员会和西康省人民政府指示和批准，由康定军管会召开的。
    出席会议的代表二百七十一人，计藏族一百八十人，汉族七十四人，彝族十二人，回族五人。代表中包括中国共产党康定地方委员会、人民解放军、康定各机关团体、工人、农民、牧民、工商界、自由职业者、土司、土千户、土百户、头人和宗教代表。土司、土千户和土百户共十五人，头人八十九人，宗教代表包括活佛、堪布、格西和喇嘛，其中黄教二十人，红教九人，花教五人，白教二人，黑教一人。
    已经团结起来了
    国民党反动派的高压、分化政策，造成了这一地区藏、汉、彝各族间的隔阂和藏、彝两族内部不团结的恶果。各族间经常发生抢劫、仇杀、械斗和打冤家的现象。像甘孜县孔萨土司和麻书土司从清末以来就不和睦。一九三八年间，国民党反动派一手制造了所谓甘孜事件，使孔萨土司德钦汪姆逃避青海西宁，国民党反动派趁势没收了她家的土地，叫麻书家代管，以致两家隔阂更深。
    人民政府虽然坚持各民族团结、友爱、互助的政策，但是，藏、彝两族内部某些由来已久的矛盾，因为解放时间不久还没有一下消除，某些土司、头人间的旧怨夙仇依然存在。像康定解放后，孔萨、麻书两家各派代表前来康定向军管会接洽，孔萨家的代表益喜多吉和麻书家的贡呷降泽，不敢同行，始终保持一天的路程，唯恐同行时发生危险。
    这次会议，他们相互间的关系和前次来康定时便不同了。益喜多吉和贡呷降泽都是代表，他们可以同在一桌吃饭了，出席会议时可以同坐一道了，贡呷降泽讲话时，孔萨益多也愿意替他翻译了，有事情也可以互相磋商了，这在国民党反动统治时期，是万不可能做到的事情，今天能够作到了，无疑的，是一种新气象。
    又像德格女土司降央伯姆的大管家俄马相子的代表丁增，她不敢单独前来康定出席会议，害怕在路上碰到冤家，当她乘坐我某部军用汽车来康定后，最初，她不敢单独在街上走，耽心仇人报复，但是，过了几天，丁增可以单独在街头漫步了，可以大瞻的出席会议了，这不能不说是一种新的气象。
    这种新气象是怎样出现的呢？应该肯定地说是苗逢澍主任、桑吉悦希委员、樊执中司令员和其他工作同志苦口婆心启发教育的收获。经过不厌烦的解释、劝说以及有关团结问题的座谈会、小组会等，代表们初步明了了各民族间和民族内部团结的重要性。他们知道在人民政府领导下，是不能且不应该再有械斗、仇杀和打冤家的事了，他们本身也要求团结、要求订出团结互助公约，他们表示要在团结方面起模范和带头作用。康定县代表日库活佛在会上号召出席会议的代表一致负起团结各族的重任，并保证他所管辖的寺院不出问题。孔萨益多在会上表示决心搞好团结，消除本地区内部的矛盾。
    应该指出：由国民党反动派挑拨成的各个民族间和民族内部的隔阂，并不是一朝一夕能消除的，上述这些收获，不过是马拉松长途赛跑刚刚燃起的火炬，要想将团结的火炬，送到最终的接力站，还有一段漫长的过程，还须要相当长的时间，还须要高度的耐心和毅力以及艰辛和细致的工作。然而决心为藏、汉、彝、回各族人民服务的苗逢澍、桑吉悦希、樊执中和昂旺格桑等同志是有信心使藏、彝各族人民团结得像一家人一样的。
    为了使代表们满意
    代表们来自康定地区的各个角落，他们有的没有进过城市，有的从来没有参加过这样的会议，怎样使他们慢慢地习惯于在会场里坐上两三个钟头，怎样使他们懂得举行会议的一套，怎样使他们感到住在招待所比住在家里还舒适。这些都得事先好好地研究筹划。
    参与会议工作的全体人员，以高度的热情和谦虚的态度来为代表们服务。代表们不懂得主持各种类型的会议时，便从旁协助。从来没有在会上讲过话的，想尽办法诱导和鼓励他们发言。不懂得会场规则的，耐心地告诉他们。总括一句话，使代表们学会一套主持会议的本领。好让他们带回家乡去，教给当地的居民。
    会议最显著的特征是表现了藏族的民族形式。各种文件表册，都用藏、汉两种文字印就。藏族代表发言，翻成汉话，汉族代表发言，翻成藏话。代表们所佩的代表证，所住的房间，以及厨房、厕所，都用藏文标明，尽管口头翻译的同志弄得舌敝唇焦，尽管文字翻译的同志夜以继日的工作，尽管在这方面花费的时间和精力较多，总之要使代表们看得懂，听得懂。
    出席会议的藏族代表，生活方式各有不同，活佛喇嘛早上要念经，每天的会议便推迟到上午十时以后。活佛喇嘛的房间是忌讳女同志进去的，便由男同志负责照顾。土司头人的房间，陈设又得不同点，茶壶杀碗全是细瓷的。他们吃不惯大米，尽量想办法供给酥油、糌粑或面食。他们坐不惯凳子，会场的座位用羊毛垫得厚厚的他们没有看过电影，隔不了三两天，开开晚会或者放上一次电影。尽量地照顾他们，就是代表死了一匹马，也得关心。理塘穹巴寺代表翁静丁增的爱马，被康定附近牛场上的牦牛撞死了，心中很难过，招待所的同志听到了，便请军管会向牛场交涉，牛场主人赔了钱。招待所的工作同志替代表们洗衣服，给他们盛饭，这为了什么？为了使代表们满意，要使代表们生活上舒适。
    “大宪章——政协共同纲领——照耀着我们”
    尽管出席会议的代表，来自牛场，来自偏远的山地，尽管他们说没有见过大的“世面”，然而朴实的藏、彝族代表，在会议当中已经显出了他们的能力。他们初次主持会议虽然生疏，经过一试再试，也就学会了。
    他们知道这样的会议，是他们本民族有史以来的第一次，日库活佛说：“我们今天能够开这样的会议，是政协共同纲领——中国人民的大宪章——照耀着我们，给我们少数民族辉煌灿烂的前途。”
    他们知道这次会议是有关他们切身利益的会议，他们认真地讨论大会的各种提案，认真地磋商协商委员会的人选和今后的工作任务。他们根据各地具体情况，提出了合理的要求和建议。丹巴的代表要求政府帮助供给茶籽菜籽，使当地过去不能种茶的今后能种茶。白玉县的藏族代表要求政府允许当地人民赴青康交界处的瓦雄，自由采运食盐，过去马匪步芳用屠杀手段镇压康北人民前往瓦雄采购食盐，以致老百姓没有盐吃，今天要结束这样的凄惨事情。炉定的彝族代表要求政府在该县设立供销合作社，因为该县没有市场，彝族的日用品，要向流动的商人购取，吃亏很大。
    他们要求藏、彝族内部团结，在会议上全体通过团结公约的决议，严格禁止仇杀、抢劫、械斗和打冤家。
    他们深深知道人民政府体贴他们、帮助他们。彝族代表说：“国民党反动派叫我们做‘蛮子’、‘化外之人’，人民政府真正把我们当做‘人’来看待了。”
    他们感谢工作同志对他们的殷勤招待，在大会上，全体代表用热烈的鼓掌来致谢意。他们不管在街头、在公共场所，见到参加会议工作的同志，便翘起大姆指，连连地说：“牙母！牙母！”（好！好！）从他们流露出的真挚情感，我们可以知道这次会议的收获。
