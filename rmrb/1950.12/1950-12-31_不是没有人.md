    It's not that there's nobody,
    Who sings better than you.
    It's not that there's nobody,
    Who is more considerate than you.
    It's not that there's nobody,
    Who is better-looking than you.
    It's not that there's nobody,
    Who is more intelligent than you.
    Guess,
    What is it that ties up my heart?
    Flowers grow on branches,
    Boats float on the water;
    My love for you,
    Is rooted in your progress.
    Flowers grow taller with the branches,
    Boats rise higher as the water rises.
    As long as your progress,
    Is faster day by day;
    My love for you,
    Will also deepen day by day.

    不是没有人……
    张明权
    不是没有人，
    比你唱的更好听。
    不是没有人，
    比你更会体贴人。
    不是没有人，
    比你生得更好看。
    不是没有人，
    比你心里更聪明。
    你猜猜，
    你凭什么拴住了我的心？
    花儿长在枝头上，
    船儿飘在水面上；
    我对你的情爱呀，
    结在你的进步上。
    花儿随着枝儿往上长，
    船儿随着水涨往上升。
    只要你的进步呀，
    一天会比一天快；
    我对你的情爱呀，
    也一天会比一天深。
