The Iron Cavalry's Swift Assault on En-da City

[Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 12th] Delayed: Our correspondent on the Kangzang front reports on the People's Liberation Army cavalry unit crossing the Nu Mountain range and swiftly assaulting En-da City, west of Qamdo, to cut off the retreat route of the enemy in Qamdo.

On the night of October 12th, the cavalry unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain area upstream of the Zhaqu River accepted the mission of occupying En-da City, west of Qamdo, day and night to cut off the enemy's retreat route from Qamdo.

From the starting point to En-da, they had to cross more than a dozen large mountains of the Nu Mountain range and two rivers. That night, braving the heavy snowfall, they marched rapidly along the Zhaqu River, through the towering mountains. The mountain climate was severely cold, and the heavy snow quickly covered the hoof prints. As the night passed and the sun broke through the mountains, they had completed more than thirty *li* of mountain road blocked by heavy snow. The soldiers looked back at the perilous mountains they had passed, raised their whips, and galloped away, one mountain peak after another falling behind them.

The cavalrymen marching in the wind and snow cherished their horses as they cherished their own eyes. Whenever they rested, they would run several *li* to cut grass or buy grass for their horses. They took care of their horses even more diligently than they took care of their own meals. Every soldier knew that the horse was their close comrade-in-arms. Five days later, on the 17th, they finally crossed En-da and successfully completed the mission of intercepting and encircling the enemy.

    铁骑奔袭恩达城经过
    【新华社重庆十二日电】迟到：本社康藏前线记者报道人民解放军骑兵部队翻越怒山山脉，奔袭昌都以西恩达城，截断昌都逃敌退路的经过称：
    十月十二日夜间，驻在杂曲河上游某地人民解放军的骑兵部队接受了昼夜兼程占领昌都以西恩达城，以截断昌都敌人的退路的任务。
    从出发地到恩达要翻过怒山山脉的十几座大山和两条河流。当夜，他们冒着纷飞的大雪，沿着杂曲河，急行在丛山峻岭之间。山间气候严寒，大雪很快就盖住了马蹄印。黑夜过去，太阳破山而出时，他们走完了三十多里的大雪封锁着的山路。战士们回头看了看他们走过了的丛山险道，就扬起鞭子，打马飞跑，一座座山峰落在他们的后边。
    在风雪中行军的骑兵们爱护自己的马，就像爱护自己的眼珠一样。一休息下来，他们就跑到几里外去给马儿割草、买草，他们饲养马匹比自己吃饭还重要。每个战士都知道，马是他们亲密的战友。五天后，他们终于在十七日越过了恩达，胜利地完成了截击包围敌人的任务。
