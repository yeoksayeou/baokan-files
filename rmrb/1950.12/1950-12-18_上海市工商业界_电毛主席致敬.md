We are willing to unite closely with people from all walks of life across the country and fight to the end for the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country! We believe that with your wise leadership, we will surely achieve victory, we will surely defeat imperialist aggression, and we will build our country into a prosperous and strong one!
