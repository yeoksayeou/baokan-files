    East China's Opera Circle Promotes the Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Composing New Tunes, Performing New Plays, Praising the People's Victory, Exposing U.S. Imperialist Aggression
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Under the call of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and inspired by the just actions of our volunteer army aiding Korea, the opera circles of East China have all stood up, plunged into the upsurge of current affairs study, and taken up propaganda weapons to resolutely struggle for resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, defending the homeland, combating rumors, and suppressing counter-revolutionary elements; tens of thousands of artists have formed a torrent of artistic iron and steel.
    The Wuhu City Opera Performers Training Class in Southern Anhui, through the study of current affairs, has basically resolved the confused thoughts of worshiping and fearing the U.S., and recognized that the American imperialists have always been our enemies. The artist brothers in the training class have all expressed their determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. They jointly organized a series of propaganda performances. During the performance of the "Hero of Dongting" and the "Resist America, Protect the Home" large-scale Yangko dance, the flames of anger against the U.S. burned in the hearts of every audience member.
    Opera circles in Yangzhou, Huaiyin, Yancheng and other places in Northern Jiangsu have also launched current affairs study, creation, and singing, and in a short period of time have compiled more than ten works such as "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea" and "U.S. Imperialism is Our Common Enemy".
    The Qingdao City opera circle in Shandong held a conference, planned the tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and in a few days adapted the "Korean Situation" script and many new programs such as crosstalk and double act. The Jinan City opera circle began to act on November 5th, organized an anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea directing committee, and compiled a large-scale anti-aggression mythological play - Hundred Flowers Garden. There have also been many achievements in the creation of drum songs, ditties, etc. They are printing and distributing various new works and have decided to hold a large-scale joint performance of resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, and defending the homeland in the New Year.
    The Quyi circles in Nanjing have formed four propaganda teams and carried out propaganda work in cooperation with literary and art groups; local opera and Peking opera circles have performed plays such as "Defending the Homeland."
    The Min opera circles in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, performed anti-U.S. aggression programs such as "Great Victory" during this year's National Day. Recently, six theater troupes and Pinghua and drum artists have organized nine anti-U.S. aggression propaganda stations and simultaneously performed their new drama programs in one week, including "Scaring Away Truman," "Li Seung-man Sits in the Palace and Sighs," and "The Neighbor is on Fire." The Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles is collecting creation materials from various places for publication.
    The opera circles in Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Songjiang in Southern Jiangsu have all held symposiums, reflecting and criticizing the ideological situation in the opera circles, exposing the conspiracies and rumors of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and unanimously proposed opposing listening to the Voice of America and Taiwan broadcasts, and refusing to listen to and perform reactionary American films, determined to study current affairs and strengthen anti-American aggression propaganda. Wuxi City has compiled and printed more than ten kinds of songs and scripts, and many theaters have self-compiled new plays, which are performed in daily business. There have also been some new creations in the Pingtan circles. Suzhou held a storytelling session, which was very effective. Three members of the Jinan Mass Peking Opera Troupe wrote to request to join the volunteer army to go to Korea to resist the U.S. aggression. The Xian Sheng Xiju Troupe and the Red Flag Huju Troupe went to the countryside to participate in land reform performances. They said: "Do a good job in the land reform to cut off the connection between the feudal class and imperialism." Twenty-odd folk art theaters in Changzhou are also enthusiastically unfolding new book storytelling of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
    The artists' research class in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, launched a study of current affairs, examined the incorrect understanding of "America is rich", and talked freely about the American army being young masters, with high weapons but low morale, not comparable to us. Everyone has basically established confidence in victory and is now creating new works of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
    Hefei City in Northern Anhui and its surrounding areas designated November 20th to 30th as the propaganda week for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and the opera circle was the mainstream of participants. Hefei City organized regular weekend evening parties, with the opera circles drawing people from various performing units in a planned way to perform fresh programs such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Workers, citizens, government offices, troops in the urban area and farmers in the suburbs all rushed to listen to the singing and watch the plays, with two to three thousand audiences every night. Because the literary and art troupe went to the countryside to participate in land reform, all the programs were borne by the opera circle; precisely because it is a regular evening party, new programs are emerging in batches, and the most popular among the masses is the "We Cannot Ignore It" Pinghua, the content is very moving, now the Northern Anhui Federation of Literary and Art Circles is collecting a large number of materials, compiling and printing works and distributing them to various places.
    Since liberation, the opera circles in East China have always been at the forefront of every political movement, especially in the great act of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. This propaganda force of tens of thousands of people resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has converged into an artistic iron torrent of defending the homeland. (Wu Shijian)

    华东戏曲界宣传抗美援朝
    编新曲，演新戏，歌颂人民胜利，暴露美帝侵略
    【本报讯】华东戏曲界在全国文联号召下，及在我援朝志愿军正义行动的鼓舞下，都挺起身来，投入时事学习热潮，拿起宣传武器为抗美援朝、保家卫国、反谣言、镇压反革命分子而坚决斗争；数万艺人已形成一股艺术的铁流。
    皖南芜湖市戏曲艺人讲习班，在时事学习中，基本解决了崇美恐美的糊涂思想，并认清了美国帝国主义者一向就是我国的敌人，学习班的艺人兄弟，都表示抗美援朝的决心。联合组织了一连串的宣传演出，在“洞庭英雄”及“抗美保家”的大秧歌的演出时，抗美的愤怒的火焰，燃烧了每个观众的心。
    苏北扬州、淮阴、盐城等地戏曲界亦展开时事学习、创作、演唱，在短短期间即已编了“抗美援朝”、“美帝是我们的公敌”等十多个作品。
    山东青岛市戏曲界开了一个大会，计划了抗美援朝工作任务，不几天即改编了“朝鲜风云”剧本及许多相声、双簧等新节目。济南市戏曲界在十一月五日即开始行动起来，组织了一个抗美援朝编导委员会，编了一个大型的反侵略神话戏——百花园，大鼓、小调等创作也有很多成绩。他们正在印发各种新的作品，并决定新年举行一次大规模抗美援朝、保家卫国的联合公演。
    南京市的曲艺界组成四个宣传队，配合文工团体展开了宣传工作；地方戏与京剧界已演出保家卫国等戏。
    福建省福州市的闽剧界，在今年国庆节即演出“大胜利”等反美侵略节目。最近六个剧团及评话、大鼓艺人，组织了九个反美侵略宣传站，在一个星期同时演唱他们新剧的节目有“惊走杜鲁门”、“李承晚坐宫自叹”、“东邻起火”等剧，现省文联正收集各地创作材料，进行出版。
    苏南的无锡、镇江、常州、苏州、松江的戏曲界都开了座谈会，反映与批判戏曲界的思想情况，揭破了蒋匪特的阴谋造谣，大家一致提出反对收听美国之音和台湾广播，提出拒听拒演反动的美国影片，决心学习时事，加强反美侵略宣传。无锡市编印了十几种歌曲、剧本，并有好多剧场自编了新戏，在日常营业中上演。评弹界亦有了些新创作。苏州举行了会书，收效颇大。济南市大众京剧团有三个团员上书要求参加志愿军赴朝抗美，先声锡剧团与红旗沪剧团下乡参加土地改革演出，他们说：“搞好土地改革工作，斩断封建阶级与帝国主义的联系。”常州二十几个人民书场也在火热地展开抗美援朝新书说唱。
    浙江省杭州市的艺人研究班开展时事学习，检查了对“美国有钱”的不正确的认识，畅谈美军是少爷兵，虽有武器士气不高，不能与我们相比，大家已基本上确立了胜利信心，现在正在创作抗美援朝新作品。
    皖北合肥市，及其附近地区，将十一月二十日至三十日定为抗美援朝宣传周，戏曲界是参加者的主流。合肥市组织了经常性的周末晚会，由戏曲界各演唱单位有计划地抽人担任演唱抗美援朝等新鲜节目，市区工人市民机关部队及郊区农民都赶来听唱看戏，每晚有二千至三千观众。这个周末晚会，因文工团下乡参加土地改革，所有节目都是戏曲界负担；正因为是经常性的晚会，所以新的节目是一批一批地涌现出来，最得群众欢迎的是“我们不能置之不理”评话，内容十分动人，现皖北文联正大量搜集材料，编印作品发给各地。
    华东戏曲界在解放后，对于每次政治运动都是不落人后的，尤其是对抗美援朝的伟大义举更不后人。这一支数万人的抗美援朝的宣传队伍，已汇成保家卫国的艺术铁流。                                    （吴石坚）
