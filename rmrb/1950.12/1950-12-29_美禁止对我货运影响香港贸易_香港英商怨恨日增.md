Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The United States government's barbaric measure of banning the export of goods to China has caused losses to British merchants in Hong Kong, resulting in a growing wave of resentment against the United States. Before the US government announced on the 16th of this month that US ships were prohibited from coming to Chinese ports, it had already issued several orders restricting cargo to China. According to a report by the Electric News Agency, this move has affected Hong Kong's trade because "at least 20 percent of Hong Kong's trade is conducted with China." The US imperialist Associated Press also revealed that because the US government's move has effectively cut off Hong Kong's trade lifeline, Hong Kong's indignation is growing rapidly, to the extent that Hong Kong Governor Alexander Grantham had to cable the Secretary of State in London, requesting "tough negotiations with Washington on the economic blockade."

    美禁止对我货运影响香港贸易
    香港英商怨恨日增
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国政府禁止向我国输出货物的蛮横措施，使香港英商遭受损失，因此发生了一股怨恨美国的浪潮。美国政府在本月十六日宣布禁止美国船只开来我国港口以前，已一连发布了几个命令，限制对我国的货运。据电通社报道，此举使香港的贸易受到影响，因为“香港的贸易至少有百分之二十是和中国进行的。”美帝国主义的美联社也透露，由于美国政府此举实际上割断了香港的贸易命脉，香港的愤慨日益迅速增长，以致香港总督葛量洪不得不致电伦敦的国务大臣，要求“就经济封锁事与华盛顿进行强硬交涉。”
