Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Under the victorious offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the American and Syngman Rhee gangs entrenched in Seoul are in utter chaos, vying to escape. According to a Reuters dispatch from Seoul on the 10th, the puppet National Assembly "has been unable to hold a formal meeting for four consecutive days." This is because "terrified members of parliament are fleeing south in droves, leaving the National Assembly without a word." From the 8th to the 10th, the number of puppet assembly members attending meetings decreased from 87 to 72, and finally to only 65, out of 206 puppet assembly members. Because the puppet government is "urgently requesting the passage of several important war legislations," supervisors from various "parties" have had to go to the provinces to "search for missing members of parliament." The Seoul-based puppet "Korean News" vehemently denounced the escape of these "assembly members" as "shameful." But those who are fleeing continue to flee, so officials from the puppet assembly said helplessly: Unless the absent members of parliament return, the assembly will "seriously consider" moving the assembly to the south within a few days.

But these reactionaries also have no confidence in the safety of the south. Therefore, according to a Reuters dispatch from Seoul on the 9th, those officials and family members of the Syngman Rhee government who have already fled to the southern end of Korea are scrambling to escape to Japan through "smuggling." They are taking "small and dilapidated motorboats or sailboats," paying a "price of $200 per person" to make "risky illegal voyages." And because "the wealthy family members of frightened government officials and military officers are gathering in a steady stream at small ports on the coast of South Korea," "boat tickets are rising in price every hour."

Before fleeing Seoul in a panic, the American and Syngman Rhee gangs have been withdrawing the people's hard-earned money they have plundered from the banks. According to the Foreign Exchange Department of the puppet National Bank, almost all of the $17,000 in savings deposits in the bank have been withdrawn by American depositors. Seoul's banks are now experiencing a "cash shortage." A senior official from the puppet "Bank of Korea" revealed that the reason for the cash shortage is that a large amount of cash has been distributed to the American aggressor troops.

    汉城美李匪帮争相南逃
    但对南方是否安全毫无信心
    【新华社十二日讯】在朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿部队胜利的进攻下，盘踞汉城的美、李匪帮已乱作一团，争相逃命。据路透社汉城十日电透露：伪国民议会“接连四天，无法举行正式会议。”因为，“吓慌了的议员，纷纷南逃，一句话也没有留下，就离开了国民议会。”八日到十日，在二百零六名伪议员中，出席会议的伪议员从八十七名减到七十二名，最后只有六十五名。由于伪政府“急迫地要求通过几项重要的战争立法”，各“党派”的督导人员，只好到各省去“搜寻失踪的议员”。汉城的伪“朝鲜新闻”大骂这些“议员”的逃跑为“可耻”。但逃跑者仍继续逃跑，因而伪议会方面人士无可奈何地说：除非缺席的议员归来，议会将“认真考虑”把议会在几天之内迁到南方去。
    但这些反动分子对于南方是否安全，也毫无信心了。因此，据路透社汉城九日电透露，那些已经逃到朝鲜南端的李承晚政府的官员及眷属，正以“走私”的方法，争向日本逃命。他们乘坐“又小又破的摩托船或帆船”，每人化了“二百美金的代价”，“作冒险的非法的航行”。而且由于“吓坏了的政府官员和军官们的富有的眷属，正川流不息地聚集在南朝鲜海岸上的小港口边”，因而“船票每小时都在涨价”。
    仓惶逃命的美、李匪帮在离开汉城前，纷纷从银行中提取搜括来的民脂民膏。据伪国家银行外汇部透露：该行储蓄存款中的一万七千美元，几已全部为美国存户所提走。汉城的银行现已发生“钞荒”，伪“朝鲜银行”的一个高级官员透露：钞荒的原因，是由于大批现钞已分配给美国侵略军。
