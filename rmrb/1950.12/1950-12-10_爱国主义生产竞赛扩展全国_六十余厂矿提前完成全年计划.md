    Patriotic Production Campaign Expands Nationwide
    Over Sixty Factories and Mines Complete Annual Plans Ahead of Schedule
    [Our Newspaper] The patriotic production campaign to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes and defend our country is now rapidly and widely unfolding in twenty-four provinces and thirteen cities across the country. The broad masses of workers are struggling to further increase production and strengthen national defense. In late October, Zhao Guoyou, a well-known labor model, led the lathe department of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant where he worked in issuing a challenge to all workers in Northeast China for a patriotic production campaign. Subsequently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to workers across the country to launch a patriotic production campaign. This call immediately received an enthusiastic response from workers in various regions. In areas where it has been carried out well, this patriotic production campaign has achieved significant results. To date, according to incomplete statistics, over sixty major factories and mines, including the Northeast No. 3 Cement Plant, a certain steel plant, the Shenyang Smelter, the Benxi Iron and Steel Plant, the Jilin Chemical Plant, the Shenyang Rubber Factories No. 5, 6, and 7, the Jilin Paper Mill, the Lushun-Dalian Yuandian Soda Factory No. 2, the Fushun Rolling Stock Plant, the North China Liulihe Cement Plant, the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Factories No. 1 and 2, the Shanghai Electric Motor Plant, the Qingdao Sifang Railway Factory, the Beijing Yanjing Paper Mill, the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Chemical Company, and the Fushun Open-Pit Mine, have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. According to statistics from the Northeast Industrial Department, as of the end of November, twelve of the thirty-four major products produced by industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China had exceeded their annual plans, including electric furnace steel ingots, electrolytic copper, ball bearings, boilers, concentrated sulfuric acid, electric wire, conveyor belts, automobile tires, inner tubes, transmission belts, plate glass, and V-belts. In November's production, nineteen of the twenty-six major products (since eight products had already completed their annual plans and were no longer in production) exceeded the monthly plan, including various steel ingots, coal, coke, inner and outer tires, cotton textiles, and concentrated and dilute sulfuric acid.
    The production of a certain cement plant in Northeast China has exceeded the annual plan by 17%, the quality is 10.75% higher than the national standard, and the cost has been reduced by 34.99%. In the competition, the workers have demonstrated great labor enthusiasm and creativity, and labor productivity has been dramatically improved. For example, Qian Zhongwen, a worker at the Lushun-Dalian Signal Factory, continuously improved his technology in the competition, increasing the number of groove nails he washed from 332 to 2,540 per day in just over a month. At the state-owned Jilin Kaishantun Paper Mill, after research by the employees during the competition, several mechanical devices and operations were improved, reducing the steaming time in wooden kettles from the quota of thirteen hours to eleven and a half hours; in papermaking, the average daily output increased from 66 tons to 68 tons, breaking the national record for similar pulping machines. As a result of these innovations, the factory completed its annual plan ahead of schedule on November 23. Yang Youde, a worker at the Shenyang No. 4 Machine Tool Plant, learned the high-speed cutting method of Soviet experts, increasing work efficiency by 21.5 times using the same machine tool. Wang Xiuming, a technician at the Lushun-Dalian Guanghe Machinery Factory, completed a flame quenching method, shortening the quenching time of workpieces from ten hours to two minutes. The Harbin Woolen Mill implemented a workshop voucher system in the competition, enabling every employee to actively control costs, changing the past habit of "not knowing the price of rice and salt without managing the household," and effectively conserving resources. The consumption of hemp rope was reduced by about half, and the amount of "Maobi Lu" oil used per month was reduced from more than 80 catties to more than 60 catties.
    However, the development of the patriotic production campaign is currently very uneven across regions. In terms of the number of employees participating in the competition, in the Northeast region, as of mid-November, more than half of the employees had not yet participated in the campaign. In Shenyang, which has developed better, 20% of employees and 40% of technicians and staff have not participated. In Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, less than 20% of employees are participating in the competition.
    Moreover, in some areas, due to the failure to earnestly conduct current affairs and ideological education for employees, they simply increased labor intensity and worked overtime without paying attention to safety, resulting in accidents and increased sick leave. This must be corrected in further carrying out the patriotic production campaign.

### 爱国主义生产竞赛扩展全国  六十余厂矿提前完成全年计划

    爱国主义生产竞赛扩展全国
    六十余厂矿提前完成全年计划
    【本报讯】抗美援朝、保家卫国的爱国主义生产竞赛运动，目前已在全国的二十四个省及十三个城市中迅速广泛展开。广大工人群众正在为进一步提高生产、增强国防力量而斗争。十月下旬，著名劳动模范赵国有带领他所在的沈阳机器三厂车工部向全东北工人提出了爱国主义生产竞赛的挑战。接着，全国总工会向全国工人发出开展爱国主义生产竞赛的号召。这一号召，立即得到各地工人群众的热烈响应。这一爱国主义生产竞赛，在开展较好的地区，已获得显著的成绩。至目前为止，根据不完全统计，已有东北第三水泥厂、某地钢铁厂、沈阳冶炼厂、本溪炼铁厂、吉林化工厂、沈阳橡胶五、六、七厂、吉林造纸厂、旅大远电曹达二厂、抚顺车辆厂、华北琉璃河水泥厂、上海钢铁公司一、二厂、上海电机厂、青岛四方铁路工厂、北京燕京造纸厂、山西省工业化学公司、抚顺露天矿等六十余主要厂矿已提前完成全年生产计划。另据东北工业部统计，截至十一月底止，东北工矿企业所生产的三十四种主要产品，已有十二种产品超过全年计划，其中包括电炉钢锭、电铜、滚珠轴承、锅炉、浓硫酸、电线、运输带、汽车外带、内胎、传动带、平板玻璃、三角带等。在十一月份的生产中，二十六种主要产品（因有八种产品已完成全年计划未再进行生产）中，有十九种产品超过全月计划，其中包括各种钢锭、煤、焦炭、内外车胎、棉织品及浓稀硫酸等。
    东北某水泥厂生产已超过全年计划的百分之十七，质量较国家规定标准提高百分之十点七五，成本降低了百分之三十四点九九。工人在竞赛中，发挥了伟大的劳动热情与创造性，劳动生产率获得了惊人的提高。如旅大信号工厂工人千钟文在竞赛中不断改进技术，在一个多月中，他洗沟钉由每天三百三十二个提高到二千五百四十个。国营吉林开山屯造纸厂在竞赛中经职工的研究，实行了若干机械装置及作业的改进，木釜的蒸煮时间由十三小时的定额缩短至十一小时半；抄造方面，由每天平均六十六吨提高到六十八吨，打破了全国同类抄浆机的最高纪录。由于这些创造，该厂得于十一月二十三日提前完成了全年计划。沈阳机器四厂工人杨有德，学习苏联专家高速切削操作法，使用同一机床，工作效率提高了二十一倍半。旅大广和机械工厂技师王修铭完成了火焰淬火法，使工作物的淬火时间由十小时缩短到两分钟。哈尔滨毛织厂在竞赛中实行了车间本票制，使每一职工都能主动掌握成本，改变了工友过去“不管家不知道油盐贵”的习惯，有效地进行了节约，麻绳消耗量约减少一半，过去每月用毛必鲁油八十余斤，现在减至六十余斤。
    但目前爱国主义生产竞赛运动在各地的发展还很不平衡。就参加竞赛的职工数目来看：在东北区，至十一月中旬止，尚有半数以上的职工未参加到运动中。开展较好的沈阳，尚有百分之二十的职工未参加，技术人员与职员则有百分之四十未参加。在天津、上海等地，参加竞赛运动的职工尚不足百分之二十。
    而且某些地区由于未能认真地向职工进行时事思想教育。只是单纯提高劳动强度，加班加点，且不注意安全工作，以致产生了发生事故、病号增加等现象。这在进一步开展爱国主义生产竞赛运动中必须注意改正。
