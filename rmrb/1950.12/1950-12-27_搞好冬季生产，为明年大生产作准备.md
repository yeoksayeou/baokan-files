The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on Launching Winter Agricultural Production Work: "…Last year, we called for doing a good job in winter production to prepare for the completion of spring plowing, which laid a good foundation for this year's production. This fully proves that winter production is not only a continued expansion of this year's production results but also a crucial step in determining next year's production."

    Changzhi Special District's Winter Production Forms a Movement
    [Our Newspaper] The winter production in Changzhi Special District has formed a movement. All counties formulated winter production plans in early December and deployed them at party congresses, people's representative conferences, and model worker conferences. In Licheng, sixteen credit cooperatives were established with a focus, and Party and League members took the lead in buying shares, resolving the masses' production capital difficulties. According to statistics from forty villages in the county, over 894,000 loads of fertilizer have been accumulated, with an average of 23 loads of fertilizer applied per mu of autumn land (with a target of 40 loads per mu). The sixth district of the county lacks only 25,000 loads of fertilizer, averaging 50 loads per mu. In Tinghepu, Xia Guihua, and 19 other villages, 659 people have found ways to participate in handicraft and sideline production. In Xiangyuan County, 94 villages have accumulated over 3.25 million dan of fertilizer. The masses in the county reflected, "We've never seen such energy before!" In Huguan County, over 16.09 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated. In Huanghuashui and five other villages, 52 carts, 82 donkeys, and 255 laborers are organized to run transportation, earning 812 shi of rice in half a month. In the fifth district of Pingshun, 10 villages with 120 laborers earned 38 shi of rice and 160,000 yuan. Their slogan is: Don't eat grain from the fields this year, eat from outside, save at home! In Yangcheng Wenmin Village, out of 420 laborers, 379 have found production opportunities. (Zhao Zuowei)

    Model Worker Yang Xianting Formulates Winter Production Plan
    [Our Newspaper] After seeing Han En's challenge, national agricultural model worker Yang Xianting (Minli Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province) also proposed his village's winter production plan to respond to the challenge. He listed delivering good public grain as the first item. He said that the entire village has prepared high-quality public grain and has organized 70 large carts into a grain transportation team, ensuring that it will be delivered in two trips. The second item is to prepare for next year's great production. In the past, the land in Beida Huang was not fertilized, but it has been fertilized in the past two years; next year, we guarantee that 55% of the land will be fertilized. Use good seeds. Third, engage in sideline occupations, including hunting, firewood gathering, mat weaving, and straw mat weaving. It has already begun. Fourth, run winter schools well. (Wu Diankun)

    Accumulate Fertilizer, Engage in Sideline Occupations, Prepare for Next Year's Production
    [Our Newspaper] Cui De (agricultural model worker of Songjiang Province) Model Mutual Aid Group in Acheng County, Songjiang Province, responded to Han En's challenge and challenged all agricultural model workers in Songjiang Province. Their conditions are four: First, make early preparations for next year's great production. The entire group guarantees to accumulate more fertilizer, apply fertilizer next year, and ensure that it is twice as much as this year. They also plan to add a weeding machine and a shovel tiller. Second, sideline production is mainly running transportation, and it is planned to earn 102 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below); women will weave mats, etc., and it is estimated to earn 60 million yuan. Third, actively respond to the government's call. The families of volunteers who go to Korea to fight in the war must be taken care of, and the entire village will be driven to engage in agricultural and sideline production. Fourth, select high-quality grain to hand over to the state. A newspaper reading group will also be established to hold current affairs seminars on a regular basis to strengthen hatred of American imperialism and transform this hatred into strength and invest it in production.

    Xinzhuangzi Village Farmers Do Not Forget Lean Years in Bumper Harvest
    [Our Newspaper] Xinzhuangzi Village, Leting County, Hebei Province, suffered a severe disaster last year and had little harvest. Under the call of the People's Government for production and self-rescue, coupled with the government's relief of a large amount of grain, they were able to overcome the severe famine.

    This year's bumper harvest, according to the old habits of farmers, should be to "enjoy, enjoy," and take a winter break. However, the farmers in the village, in view of last year's disaster and the care and consideration of the People's Government, are actively engaged in sideline production this winter. As village head Bai Fengnian said: "Don't think we've had a bumper harvest this year, we can't forget the suffering of the famine. We can't be idle this winter, we must do a good job in sideline production." The village's sideline occupation is mainly fish farming. Ninety young adults are organized to catch 450 jin per day, earning 450,000 yuan. Since the freeze, they have earned a total of 9 million yuan. Entering December, the farmers' enthusiasm for fishing has increased even more, working early and late. Village head Bai Fengnian said: "There are still two months left before the ice melts. If we catch 1,000 jin of fish per day, we can earn 60,000 jin of grain, which will be of great help to next year's production." Nearby villages such as Sugezhuang and Shuangmiao have also become active under their influence. (Chen Yutian)

    今年丰收了，按照农民旧有习惯，就该“享受享受”，歇歇冬。但该村农民，鉴于去年的灾害，及人民政府的关怀和体贴，今冬都积极进行了副业生产。正如村长白凤年所说：“别看今年丰收了，我们不能忘掉灾荒之苦，今冬不能闲着，必须搞好副业。”该村副业主要是治鱼，九十名青壮年组织起来每天能捕四百五十斤，可收入四十五万元。结冻以来，已共收入九百万元。进入十二月，农民捕鱼的劲头更大了，起早贪黑的干。村长白凤年说：“现在离开冻还有两个月的功夫，每天按捕鱼一千斤计，就能收入六万斤粮，对明年生产有很大帮助。”附近各村如苏各庄、双庙等村农民，在他们的影响下，也活跃起来。
