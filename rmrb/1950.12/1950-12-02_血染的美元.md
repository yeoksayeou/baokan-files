Blood-Stained Dollars
Soviet Union Yi·Lieming

    At the recent United Nations General Assembly, the American imperialists and their lackeys tore up the Soviet Union's proposals to ban war propaganda, ban atomic weapons, conclude a peace pact among the five major powers, and reduce armaments by one-third among major countries from 1950 to 1951. They are inciting military hysteria, organizing a frenzied arms race, and attempting to expand the scope of their ongoing aggression. After meeting with MacArthur, U.S. President Truman delivered a bellicose speech, calling for further expansion of armaments and putting the entire national economy onto a military footing. To achieve these goals, American imperialism is brutally oppressing its European partners.
    The capitalist economy's drift towards preparations for a new war is inseparable from the monopoly capitalists' insane attack on the people's living standards. Truman and Acheson, Attlee and Bevin, Pleven and Schuman announce arms expansion plans, calling on the working people to prepare for new sacrifices and thrift, no longer demanding cream, bread, and housing, in order to manufacture more cannons, tanks, and airplanes.
    New poverty and sacrifices - this is what the working people must endure. As for the capitalists, the military economy, the arms race, aggression, and war, merely signify mythical dividends and military super-profits.
    War - a huge disaster for the masses of the people, but for the capitalists, as Lenin said, it is "a very profitable business." In the eyes of the capitalists, the capitalist military-economic system guarantees military serf-like exploitation of workers and maximum profits for the monopolistic capitalists. Lenin wrote: "Whether in America or in Germany, the adjustment of economic life is always to create military serfdom for the workers (and a section of the peasants) and to create paradise for the bankers and capitalists."
    The "Cold War," aggression in Korea, the arms race, and preparations for a new war, which bring disaster to the masses of the people, are all sources of profit for the capitalists.
    During World War II, American monopoly capital exchanged the blood and disaster of humanity for huge profits. Even according to understated official materials, between 1941 and 1945, the net profits (excluding taxes) of the largest groups were close to fifty billion dollars, more than three times the profits obtained during the five years before World War II. However, after the war ended, profits continued to grow. The largest trusts preparing for new aggression and manufacturing military equipment were not damaged by the crisis and reduced production. Comrade Stalin, when describing the economic situation of capitalist countries and the nature of the intensification of capitalist contradictions in the midst of the 1930 crisis at the Sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), pointed out: "But there is one sector of production that has not been affected by panic. This sector is the military industry. Despite the panic, this sector is constantly developing. The bourgeois states are frantically arming, excessively arming. What for? Of course, not for negotiation but for war. The imperialists need war because war is the only way to re-divide the world, re-divide commodity markets, divide sources of raw materials, and divide investment spheres of influence."
    Such a statement is perfectly suited to describing the post-war economy of American imperialism. The income of the largest monopoly capital in the post-war years not only far exceeded the record-breaking levels of the war period, but also grew year after year. The net profit of the largest metallurgical trust, "United States Steel Corporation," was 130 million dollars in 1948, 63 million dollars in 1943, and reached 166 million dollars last year. "General Electric Company" obtained a net profit of 126 million dollars last year - more than five times that of 1938. The masters of the largest "General Motors Corporation" put 656 million dollars of profit into their own pockets in 1949, which is one and a half times more than the previous year and four times more than in 1943.
    The transition from the "Cold War" to open military aggression in the Far East has brought American working people rising prices, increased taxes, reduced consumption of food and daily necessities, declining living standards, and intensified exploitation by a handful of monopoly capitalists. Prices of various goods have risen by almost one-third since 1946. Military expenditure (if one examines hidden and indirect military expenditure) is close to 50 billion dollars in the 1950-51 fiscal year.
    This heavy burden is completely transferred to the shoulders of the working people in the United States and Marshallized countries. As for the heads of Wall Street, new boundaries of plunder and profit have only been opened up in front of them.
    The unprecedented military "boom" accompanies the predatory war waged by American aggressors in Korea, and the factory owners of arsenals, dark entrepreneurs and speculators, and giants of the American financial world feast and celebrate during this time of plague. Ford happily cheered after the American invasion of Korea: "The war will not harm our business." Monopoly capitalists are vainly seeking ways to avoid economic crises in war and the military economy. However, the military economy ultimately prepares the preconditions for a more serious and destructive economic crisis.
    The New York Times wrote: "Washington has once again become a place of pilgrimage for entrepreneurs." Just as during the war, thousands of entrepreneurs and speculators, representatives of the largest monopoly capital, gathered in the American capital, eagerly discussing in various departments and bureaus, greedily distributing military orders among themselves. American economic magazines and newspapers regularly tell "entrepreneurs" where to receive more profitable military orders.
    As is well known, during World War II, the one hundred largest groups received more than two-thirds of all national military orders, and one-third of them fell into the hands of ten monopoly giants. In the post-war period, the process of capital concentration and the combination of financial oligarchs and state organs have been strengthened and accelerated. The departments and bureaus are filled with representatives from Wall Street, representatives and agents from Morgan, DuPont, Rockefeller, Ford, and Harriman. A few dozen families have seized many major military orders and all military profits.
    For the British monopoly capitalists, for the owners and heads of the "Confederation of British Manufacturers," the "Imperial Chemical Trust," the "Vickers" arms concern, the "Imperial Shell" oil monopoly, the tin, rubber, and other raw material monopolies, and for colonial companies like "Unilever," which haunt many colonial countries and vassal states like a monster, the military boom is beneficial.
    The British financial magnates are united with Wall Street monopoly capitalists in implementing foreign aggression policies and military adventures. The imperialists' intervention in Korea has opened up a new stage for the militarization of Britain. The Labor government has formulated a new three-year arms plan requiring 3.6 billion pounds.
    The militarization of social life, the madness of the reactionaries, and the heavy burden of military expenditure are combined with attacks on the living standards of the working people.
    The British military budget for 1950-51 exceeded the pre-war level by more than four times. It has sharply increased the tax burden. The direct taxes now borne by workers are more than six times higher than before the war, and indirect taxes are three and a quarter times higher. It is reflected in a very poor condition for workers and their families. Per capita, sugar consumption has decreased by 20% compared to pre-war levels, meat has decreased by 30%, and oil and cured meat have decreased by 50%. The real wages of workers have decreased by 20% to 22% in the last three years alone (since June 1947). The government, with the support of reactionary trade union scabs, is pursuing a policy of "freezing wages," that is, further reducing real wages in the face of rising prices and inflation. The new arms plan is inseparable from the further deterioration of the living conditions of the broad masses. Attlee explained this plan by declaring: This plan "inevitably portends the ill omen of Britain's living standards."
    On the contrary, monopoly capital has thus obtained new possibilities for plunder and enrichment. The profits of monopoly capital have continued to grow in the post-war period. In the first seven months of this year, corporate profits increased by another 7% compared to last year. The profits of metallurgical plants, aircraft factories, machine factories, and electrical companies have especially expanded. According to a commentary in the Daily Worker, the implementation of the new three-year arms plan has at least tacitly promised the wealthy of the City of London another billion pounds in net profit!
    The heads of Wall Street and the Pentagon (U.S. Department of Defense) are forcing all Marshallized countries to accept new arms plans that are over-expanded beyond their economic capacity. Under pressure from the United States, France has adopted a three-year plan that is expected to almost double military spending. In Italy, in order to please Washington, the number of armed forces has increased two and a half to three times. Belgium's military budget has almost doubled compared to last year, and Denmark has increased by 40%. Even small Switzerland has passed a five-year plan for very military expenditure. But the American warmongers are still not satisfied with these. Angry shouts are often sent from across the ocean to the Marshallized countries: "European countries have not done their best."
    As Marshallized countries implement huge military plans, the living standards of the masses are declining more ruthlessly than in the United States. The arms race deepens those countries' dependence on American financial and military "aid," prompting the "complete" subordination of the economies and politics of the Marshallized countries to the United States.
    The militarization of the Marshallized countries has primarily enriched American monopoly capitalists. But the financial oligarchs of these countries have also obtained their share of profits from repeatedly selling out the interests of their own people.
    In France, while the profits of monopoly capitalists continue to grow, the real wages of workers have almost reached half of what they were before the war. The implementation of the new three-year arms plan, costing two trillion francs, has brought new poverty to the French people, but new profits to French and American monopoly capital.
    In 1918, Lenin, in a letter to American workers, pointed out that the financial magnates of the United States had made a fortune in the war, plundering hundreds of billions of dollars: "On every dollar, there is a stain. The stain is caused by the 'profitable' military plans that enrich the rich and bankrupt the poor in every country. On every dollar, there are some bloodstains. These bloodstains are stained in the blood sea of ten million murdered and twenty million disabled..."
    Today's dollars, manufacturers, bankers, and the mythical profits of all other Wall Street financial magnates are stained with filth and blood. They are madly making fortunes on the disasters and poverty of millions of people, on the insane bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea, on the manufacture of atomic bombs and other tools for the mass slaughter of humanity, and on preparing for new massacres.
    All policies of the American financial dictatorship and the policy of provoking a third world war are marked by filth and blood. Those who are planning and implementing these policies are those who are preparing for aggression and are becoming increasingly rich in war.
    Wall Street monopoly capitalists are by no means satisfied with the profits they have obtained in preparing for aggression. For them, this is only a small amount among the profits they hope to obtain by aggression, plunder, and enslavement of other countries and other nations. Therefore, the American financial oligarchs, who are provoking war for American world hegemony, are forgetting the lessons of history and are repeating the mistakes of the German fascist dictatorship.
    But the people have not forgotten anything and have learned a lot. The increasingly consolidated and powerful front for peace, which is tearing apart the mad plans of the new warmongers, is proof of this.

    血染的美元
    苏联  伊·列明
    在最近举行的联合国大会上，美国帝国主义者及其从仆们撕碎了苏联关于禁止战争宣传、禁止原子武器、五大国缔结和平公约和一九五○年至一九五一年间各大国裁减军备三分之一的建议。他们煽动着军事的歇斯底里，组织着疯狂的军备竞争，力图扩大他们正在进行的侵略的范围。美国总统杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟会谈后，发表了好战的演说，呼吁进一步扩充军备并把全国经济转上军事轨道。为了达到这些目的，美国帝国主义残酷地压迫着自己的欧洲伙计。
    资本主义经济走向新战争的准备是与垄断资本家疯狂进攻人民的生活水平分不开的。杜鲁门和艾奇逊，艾德礼和贝文，普利文和舒曼宣布扩充军备计划，号召劳动人民准备新的牺牲和节约，不再要求奶油、面包和住屋，为的是多制造些大炮、坦克和飞机。
    新的穷困和牺牲——这是劳动人民所承受的。至于对资本家来说，军事经济、军备竞争、侵略和战争，只不过意味着神话般的红利和军事上的超额利润。
    战争——对于人民群众是巨大的灾难，但对于资本家，却正如列宁所说，是“非常有利的事”。在资本家看来，资本主义的军事经济制度保证着对工人的军事苦役式的剥削和独占资本家最高限度的利润。列宁写道：“不论在美国或在德国，经济生活的整顿，总是为了给工人（及一部分农民）创造军事苦役，而给银行家和资本家创造天堂。”
    给人民群众带来灾难的“冷战”、侵略朝鲜、军备竞争和准备新战争都是资本家求得利润的泉源。
    在第二次世界大战期间，美国垄断资本用人类的血和灾难换得了巨大的利润。甚至按照被缩小了的官方材料，在一九四一至一九四五年间，最大的集团的纯利（税收除外）几近五百亿美元，比第二次世界大战前的五年期间所获得的利润超过了三倍。但是，战争结束后，利润继续增长着。准备新侵略的工业和制造军事器材的最大托拉斯并没有受到危机和缩减生产的损害。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上叙述资本主义国家的经济状况和一九三○年危机高潮中间资本主义矛盾尖锐化的性质时，指示说：“但是有一个生产部门是没有受到恐慌影响的。这个部门就是军事工业。虽有恐慌，但这部门却是经常发展着。资产阶级国家都拚命的武装，过度的武装。为的是什么呢？当然，不是为了要谈判而是为了战争。帝国主义者所以需要战争，因为战争是重新瓜分世界的唯一方法，重新瓜分商品市场，瓜分原料来源地，瓜分投资势力范围的唯一方法”。
    这样的说法是完全适于说明战后美帝国主义的经济的。最大的垄断资本在战后几年中的收入，不仅远远超过了战争时期突破纪录的水平，而且年复一年地增长着。最大的冶金托拉斯“美国钢铁公司”的纯利，在一九四八年是一亿三千万美元，在一九四三年是六千三百万美元，而在去年已达到一亿六千六百万美元了。“通用电气公司”在去年获得了一亿二千六百万美元的纯利——大于一九三八年五倍。最大的“通用汽车公司”的主人们，在一九四九年把六亿五千六百万美元的利润都放到自己的腰包里，这就是说，比前一年大一倍半，比一九四三年大四倍。
    美国帝国主义从“冷战”到在远东公开进行军事侵略行动的过渡期间，给美国劳动人民带来了物价的高涨、捐税的加重、粮食和日用品消费量的减少、生活水平的下降、一小撮垄断资本家剥削的加强。各种物价比一九四六年几乎上涨了三分之一。军事开支（如果检查一下掩藏的和间接的军事开支）在一九五○年——五一年度约近五百亿美元。
    这个沉重的负担完全转嫁在美国和马歇尔化国家的劳动人民的肩上。至于华尔街的头子们呢，在他们的前面只开拓了掠夺和利润的新界限。
    空前的军事“景气”伴随着美国侵略者们在朝鲜所进行的掠夺战争，兵工厂的厂主、黑暗的事业家和投机家、美国金融界巨子们就在这种黑死病流行的时候欢宴庆贺。福特在美国侵入朝鲜后高兴地欢呼：“战争不会损害我们的事业”。垄断资本家们在战争和军事经济中白费心力地寻求避免经济危机的方法。但是，军事经济最后却准备着更严重的、有破坏性的经济危机的前提。
    《纽约时报》写道：“华盛顿又成为事业家们的巡礼地了”。正像在战争期间一样，数千事业家和投机家，最大的垄断资本代表们聚集于美国首都，在各部、局中热烈地讨论着，彼此贪婪地分配着军事定单。美国的经济杂志和报纸经常的告诉“事业家们”：什么地方可以接到利润更丰厚的军事定单。
    如所周知，在第二次世界大战期间，一百个最大的团体曾接到了国家全部军事订货的三分之二以上，而且其中三分之一落到十个垄断巨子的手里。在战后期间，资本的集中过程，财政寡头和国家机关的结合愈加强和加速了。在各部、局里坐满了华尔街的代表们，摩根、杜邦、洛克菲勒、福特和哈里曼的代表们和委托人们。少数的几十个家族攫得了许多主要的军事定单和军事利润的全部。
    对于英国垄断资本家来说，对于“不列颠制造商联合会”、“帝国化学托拉斯”、“维寇斯”军火康采恩、“帝国壳牌”石油垄断公司、锡、橡胶及其他各种原料的垄断公司的主人和头子们来说，以及对于像妖怪一样缠绕着许多殖民地国和附庸国的“尤尼勒佛尔”之类殖民地公司来说，军事景气都是有利益的。
    英国的财阀，是与华尔街垄断资本家们联合在一起，实行国外侵略政策和军事冒险的。帝国主义者们对朝鲜的干涉，为英国的军国主义化开辟了新阶段。工党政府制定了需款三十六亿英镑的新的三年军备计划。
    社会生活的军国主义化、反动派的疯狂、军事开支的重荷，与对劳动人民生活水平的进攻是结合在一起的。
    一九五○年——五一年度英国军事预算超过了战前水平四倍以上。它使捐税负担急剧地加重了。现在职工所负担的直接税比战前增加了六倍多，间接税增加了三又四分之一倍。它反映于工人及其家庭方面是一种非常恶劣的状况。按每人来说，糖的消费较战前减少了百分之二十，肉减少了百分之三十，油和腌肉减少了百分之五十。职工的实际工资仅在最近三年中（从一九四七年六月起）就减少了百分之二十至二十二。政府在反动职工会工贼的支持下，进行着“冻结工资”的政策，即在物价高涨和通货膨胀状态中进一步降低实际工资。新的军备计划与广大群众生活条件的进一步恶化是分不开的。艾德礼解释这个计划时这样宣称：这个计划“势难避免英国的生活水平的恶兆”。
    却正相反，垄断资本因此得到了掠夺和致富的新可能性。垄断资本的利润在战后期间不断增长着。在今年前七个月中，公司的利润比去年又增加了百分之七。冶金工厂、飞机工厂、机器工厂和电气公司的利润尤其扩大了。据《工人日报》的评论说，新的三年军备计划的实施对伦敦城区的富豪们至少又暗许了十亿英镑的纯利！
    华尔街和五角大楼（美国国防部）的头目们，强迫一切马歇尔化国家接受他们的经济能力所不及的过度膨胀的新军备计划。在美国的压力下，法国采取了预计把军事开支几乎增加两倍的三年计划。在意大利，为了讨得华盛顿的欢心，军备力量的数量增加了两倍半至三倍。比利时的军事预算与去年相较几乎膨胀了一半，丹麦增加了百分之四十。甚至小国瑞士也通过了一个非常军事开支的五年计划。但是美国战争贩子对于这些，还是感着不满足。从海洋彼岸时常对马歇尔化各国发出了愤怒的叫喊：“欧洲国家没有尽其所能”。
    当马歇尔化国家实现了庞大的军事计划之际，群众的生活水平比美国更无情地下降着。军备竞赛加深了那些国家对美国财政和军事“援助”的依赖性，促使马歇尔化国家的经济和政治“完全”隶属于美国。
    马歇尔化国家的军事化使美国垄断资本家首先发了财。但是这些国家的财政寡头从屡次出卖本国人民利益这一方面，也获得了自己的一份利润。
    在法国，当垄断资本家的利润不断增长之际，职工的实际工资几乎达到了战前的一半。需费二万亿法郎的新的三年军备计划的实现，给法国人民带来了新的穷困，但给法国和美国的垄断资本，却带来了新的利润。
    一九一八年，列宁在给美国工人的信中指示说，美国的财阀们在战争中发了大财，掠夺了数千亿美元：“在每一块美元上，都有一个污点。造成这个污点的是使每个国家的富人发财而穷人破产的‘生利的’军事计划。在每一块美元上都有一些血迹。这些血迹是在一千万被屠杀者和两千万残废者所流的血海中染上的……”。
    今日的美元、制造商、银行家和所有其他华尔街财阀们的神话般的利润，都沾着污秽和鲜血。在数百万人的灾难和贫困上，在对朝鲜的和平城市和乡村的疯狂轰炸上，在制造原子弹与其他大规模屠杀人类的工具和准备新屠杀上，他们疯狂地发着财。
    美国金融独裁政治的一切政策、挑拨第三次世界大战的政策都标志着污秽和鲜血。策划着而且实现着这些政策的就是那些准备侵略并在战争中愈益发财的人们和集团。
    华尔街的垄断资本家们决不满足于他们在准备侵略中所获得的那些利润。对于他们，这只是他们希望靠侵略、掠夺并奴役其他国家、其他民族而获得的利润中间很少的数目。因此，为美国的世界霸权而挑拨着战争的美国财政寡头，忘记了历史的教训，正在重蹈着德国法西斯独裁政治的覆辙。
    但是人民却对什么也没有忘记，而且学会了很多。撕碎了新战争贩子的疯狂计划的日益巩固强大的和平阵线，就是明证。
