    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korean Frontline Report: First Victory at Wenjing
    Li Ban, Lu Yiding
    At 9:00 PM on October 25th, the entire Third Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Sixth Division of the Li Seung-man bandit army, equipped with vehicles, advanced frantically on the highway leading to Manpo and Chosan, when suddenly gunfire erupted within the vehicle column. Several vehicles packed with enemies were immediately destroyed by dense gunfire, and the column of over thirty vehicles and a long line of infantry were cut into three sections.
    The brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army lay in ambush at Liangshuiding, under the jurisdiction of Beizhen in North Pyongan Province. Company Commander Geng Wenting, not allowing the enemies in the first two vehicles time to scatter, immediately ordered the Third Platoon to cut in from the side of the vehicles, disrupting the enemy first. Platoon Deputy Zhu Dianrong killed four enemies with bursts from his pistol. Ninth Squad soldier Wei Chuncai shot and killed an enemy with his rifle, then quickly approached the highway, forcing four enemies to surrender with his bayonet. A certain unit's Third Battalion, cutting off the enemy from the north mountain of Fuxingdong, bombarded the enemies under the vehicles on the highway with hand grenades. The enemies rolled and crawled in the black smoke of the explosions. Those still alive trembled in fear in the rice paddies and under the vehicles. When the soldiers pointed their bayonets at their backs, they knelt down and surrendered. Two howitzers being towed by tractors were captured by our army before they could be unloaded.
    The enemy infantry cut off after reaching Fuxingdong also suffered sudden casualties from our dense firepower. First Squad soldier Sun Wensheng charged forward, firing at the chaotic enemy, killing six. Soldier Tian Guixiang used three hand grenades to thwart a squad of enemies' three attempts to escape. Machine gun squad leader Liao Hanyuan's machine gun followed each infantry charge. The enemies fell one after another under his accurate fire, thrown into disarray.
    On the mountains on both sides of the highway, the warriors charging to kill the enemy, inspired by the slogans "Avenge the Korean people!" "Eliminate the American invaders and the Li Seung-man bandit army!" and "Defend the motherland from invasion!" forgot the extreme fatigue of continuous forced marches and charged fiercely at the enemy. A certain unit's young soldier Wang Xinke, ignoring his legs which had become swollen from the arduous march, charged in the forefront, persisting on the front lines despite a waist injury. Machine gun squad leader Ma Qinglian, forgetting the blisters raised on his palms by the hot gun casing, aimed his machine gun and accurately fired at the enemy.
    To save the rapidly advancing forces and infantry that had been surrounded, the enemy launched a fierce attack on the north mountain of Fengdadong with more than a battalion of troops. The steel warriors of a certain unit of our People's Volunteer Army, defending the position, repeatedly repulsed more than ten enemy attacks. The soldiers were determined to live and die with the position, using hand grenades and counter-attacks, driving the enemy back again and again. Enemy officers shouted and threatened the soldiers below the mountain, coercing them to charge upwards. But the cowardly enemies became weaker and weaker with each charge, and in the last few attempts, only two people crawled halfway up the mountain before rolling back down. The Third Platoon soldiers defending the position remained calm as usual, aiming and firing, regardless of the enemy's dense artillery fire. A machine gun of the Third Squad leader of the machine gun company, Huang Benxing, killed more than twenty enemies. Ninth Squad Deputy Fan Chunlu led thirteen soldiers, fighting three times against enemies three times their number, using hand grenades to thwart four enemy attacks. Squad leader Fan Darong, wounded but refusing to leave the front lines, led his entire squad in breaking out of the forward position, repelling multiple enemy attacks with continuous counter-attacks. In the end, the enemy suffered more than a hundred casualties, left behind more than forty corpses and retreated, watching helplessly as their rapidly advancing forces were completely annihilated.

    李班  路以丁
    十月二十五日下午九时，装备着汽车的李承晚匪军第六师第二联队的第三大队全部，在通往满浦和楚山的公路上疯狂地冒进时，枪声突然在汽车行列里响起来。数辆满载敌人的汽车，立即为密集的枪炮所击毁，三十多辆汽车的行列和很长的步兵被切成三段。
    中国人民志愿部队的勇士们预伏在平安北道北镇所属的两水洞。连长耿文廷不让前面两辆汽车上的敌人有时间散开，立刻命令三排从汽车侧面拦腰插上去，首先将敌人打乱。排副祝殿荣用匣枪连发打死四个敌人。九班战士魏春财用步枪打死一个敌人后，迅速迫近公路，用刺刀逼迫四个敌人缴了枪。从富兴洞北山拦腰切断敌人的某部三营，战士们用手榴弹向公路上汽车底下的敌人排击。敌人在爆炸的黑烟中连滚带爬。活着的，吓得爬在稻田里和汽车底下发抖。当战士们用刺刀指着他们的背脊时，便跪下缴枪。用牵引车拖着的两门榴弹炮，未及卸下即被我军缴获。
    进到富兴洞被切断的敌人步兵，也遭到我密集火力的突然杀伤。一连战士孙文盛冲上去，向混乱的敌人射击，击毙六名敌人。战士田贵祥用三颗手榴弹，打垮敌人三次企图夺路逃跑的一个班。机枪班长廖汉元的机枪随各步兵冲锋，敌人在他的准确射击下纷纷地倒下，乱成一团。
    公路两侧大山，冲杀敌人的勇士们，在“为朝鲜人民报仇！”“消灭美国侵略者和李承晚匪军！”“保卫祖国不受侵略！”的口号鼓舞下，忘却了连续强行军的极度疲劳，纷纷向敌人猛插。某部青年战士王心珂，不顾因艰苦行军走肿了的腿肚子，冲在最前面，腰部负伤仍坚持不下火线。机枪班长马清连，忘却了被热烫的枪壳烙起泡的双掌，端起机枪向敌人准确地射击。
    敌人为挽救被陷入包围的快速部队和步兵，以一个多营的兵力猛攻丰大洞北山。我人民志愿部队某部扼守阵地的钢铁战士们，连续打垮敌人十多次进攻。战士们都抱着与阵地共存亡的决心，用手榴弹、用反冲锋，一次又一次地将敌人打下去。敌人军官在山下吵嚷着。威逼士兵们往上冲。但畏缩的敌人，却越冲越没有劲，最后几次只有两个人爬到山半腰就滚回去了。而坚守阵地的三排战士们，不顾敌人密集的炮火，仍镇静如常，瞄准射击。机枪连三班长黄本兴的一挺机枪，就打死了二十多个敌人。九班副范春禄率十三个战士，与三倍于已的敌人冲杀三次，用手榴弹打垮敌人的四次进攻。班长范达荣负伤不下火线，率领全班突出阵地前沿，用连续的反冲锋，打退敌人的多次进攻。最后敌人伤亡百多名，掉下四十多具尸体撤退，眼巴巴地看着其快速部队被全部歼灭了。
