The massive Huai River control project partially commenced in the upper, middle, and lower reaches in late November. In the upper reaches, the Nanwangpo depression reservoir project in Yancheng County, Henan Province, started on November 20th. A large number of laborers from Yancheng, Wuyang, and other counties in the vicinity are participating in the construction. Before the start of construction, the People's Representative Conferences of all circles in the aforementioned counties were convened to discuss the mobilization and organization of laborers. To ensure the early commencement of various projects in the upper reaches, the Henan Provincial Huai River Control Headquarters has dispatched inspection teams to Xuchang, Xinyang, Huangchuan, and other special districts to inspect and supervise the province's preparatory work for Huai River control. In the middle reaches, Huai River control leadership organizations at all levels in the Northern Anhui Administrative Region are successively moving to the embankment to work. The levee restoration and dredging projects for this winter and next spring in the middle reaches were surveyed in mid-November. The enclosure dikes protecting the Huainan coal mining area and Bengbu City started construction successively in late November, with more than 10,000 laborers already on the embankment. The entire levee protection project requires a total of more than 280,000 laborers. To ensure the supply of grain and coal to the laborers, supply and transportation organizations in various parts of Northern Anhui are currently transporting 50 million jin of grain and 60 million jin of coal to the construction sites. The Northern Anhui Production Relief and Huai River Control Temporary Headquarters has dispatched more than 3,000 cadres to organize disaster victims to participate in Huai River control work as a form of work relief. In the lower reaches, in addition to continuing to discuss the route of the Huai River estuary channel, the Northern Jiangsu Huai River Control Headquarters has begun the work of dewatering and dredging the dam site of the Sanhe movable dam, to further study the stratum and soil quality of the dam site. In addition, the Northern Jiangsu area has decided to carry out the repair and management projects of the Grand Canal, the Yi River, and several major drainage rivers within the Huaiyin Special District this winter, to ensure the safety of the entire Grand Canal levee before the completion of the Huai River estuary channel. The winter repair projects of various rivers within the Huaiyin Special District all started around November 20th, with the participation of 370,000 laborers.

Prior to this, the Huai River Control Committee successively held its first plenary session and a political work conference. The plenary session was held in Bengbu City from November 7th to 12th. In addition to the attendance of all members, representatives from relevant departments, water conservancy experts, and responsible cadres from the Huai River areas in northern Anhui Province also attended. Li Baohua, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, attended the meeting to provide guidance. After listening to the preliminary plans of the relevant departments for the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Huai River, and the survey reports on the hydrology of the Huai River, the estuary channel, and the tributaries and storage areas of the Huai River, the meeting, in accordance with the Huai River control decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and based on these reports and the specific conditions of various places, after repeated discussions, uniformly formulated the engineering and financial plans for the first year of radically controlling the Huai River from this winter to next spring. The plan specifically outlined the scale and steps of the flood storage, levee restoration, dredging, ditching, and culvert projects in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River, and provided preliminary opinions on the estuary channel, unifying the earthwork unit prices and financial estimates of the three provinces of Henan, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu. In addition, in order to strengthen the unified leadership of the Huai River control work, the meeting also determined the establishment and responsibilities of Huai River control organizations at all levels. The political work conference was held from November 14th to 19th. The meeting discussed how to strengthen the political leadership of Huai River control to ensure the smooth implementation of the Huai River control plan. At the meeting, Lu Xuebin, Minister of the Political Department of the Huai River Control Committee, pointed out that the tasks of the political work of Huai River control are: 1. To cooperate with local Party and government organs to mobilize and organize the people's strength to form a Huai River control labor army. 2. To educate and unite cadres and laborers, carry out a merit-making campaign and recreational activities to give play to the initiative and creativity of cadres and laborers; and to cultivate activists and cadres in the movement. 3. To strengthen security work, ensure the order and material safety of Huai River control, and prevent and crush sabotage activities by bandits and special agents. 4. To assist local governments in resolving specific issues such as the relocation of households and land adjustment that occur in Huai River control. The meeting earnestly discussed the above-mentioned tasks, and conducted specific studies in groups on the propaganda and education work of Huai River control, as well as how to carry out the merit-making campaign and recreational activities.
