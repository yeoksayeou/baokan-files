    Linjiang Township's Reservoir Waterproofing
    ——An Example of Following the Mass Line
    Xiao Rong, Lin Wei
    Many construction projects require the state to spend money, and many construction projects do not necessarily require the state to spend money. In some cases, the state can mess things up even when it spends money; in other cases, the state can do things well even without spending money. This depends on how the working comrades lead the masses to do things.
    At the northern bend of the Yong River's estuary, there is a township called Linjiang Township, which belongs to Zhenhai County, Zhejiang. Across the county seat is the sea. The township has eleven small villages with over a thousand people. The five villages along the river are often plagued by tidal floods. The soil is salty. Most of the farmers grow cotton and are commonly known as "salt land people." The six villages inland are higher in elevation and separated by river ditches, so tidal water does not easily flood them. The soil is fresh. Most of the farmers grow rice and are commonly known as "fresh land people."
    Reservoir waterproofing is a major annual event in Linjiang Township. In years with small tides, the river embankment is rarely damaged, and the cotton farmers along the river can simply repair it. But when there are large tides, the river embankment is heavily damaged, and the difficulties begin. Cotton farmers are eager to repair it, but they don't have enough manpower. If rice farmers are asked to help, they are unwilling. There are two reasons for their unwillingness: one is that the tide doesn't easily flood their land; the other is that when they usually go to the embankment to cut grass for their cattle, the cotton farmers interfere. Some rice farmers have even had their grass baskets and sickles taken away, and they harbor resentment. Therefore, they would rather dig more river ditches to store water for irrigating rice.
    Last year's two large tides in July and August were more severe than any in the past decade. Over 1,400 zhang of river embankment were destroyed, a total of 470 zhang. The cotton fields were flooded, and the cotton farmers suffered heavy losses. The rice fields also suffered reduced yields compared to previous years because the river ditches were filled with saltwater. It took a lot of manpower to cart the saltwater out bucket by bucket. However, compared to the heavy losses of the cotton farmers, the rice farmers felt that they had not suffered much damage.
    After the large tide in August, the district cadres went to Linjiang to hold meetings and mobilize people to repair the reservoir. The cotton farmers were all willing, but the rice farmers refused to participate no matter what was said. A few who harbored resentment started arguing, and they almost got into a fight. The meeting broke up without any results, and the district cadres never went there again. They said, "The masses in this village are too backward to be helped." As a result, the problem of repairing the reservoir remained unresolved until this spring. Later, Deputy Commander Wang of the county water conservancy command made a mistake by independently saying that the government could provide grain for repairs. In reality, the government was facing great difficulties and could only allocate grain for repairing the sea embankment, but did not have the capacity to care for the river embankment. Therefore, Deputy Commander Wang's words became an "empty promise." Moreover, the county-level leading organs adopted a negative attitude of indifference towards the repair of the river embankment because there was no solution!
    The matter was delayed until June 14th, when Comrade Li of the Ningbo Prefectural Committee inspected the work of the Zhenhai County Committee and discovered the report from Linjiang Township, saying that this matter could not be ignored. The county committee said there was no solution, so Comrade Li went to Linjiang himself and discussed the matter with several rural cadres. Everyone became discouraged when they heard that there was still no grain. They presented a long list of difficulties, such as no food to eat, no tools, being busy with pumping water, and it being too late in the year. However, when asked if it was okay not to repair the reservoir this year, they all said it was not. What could be done? Comrade Li explained the government's difficulties, pointing out that it was indeed impossible for the government to provide grain for both the sea embankment and the river embankment. At the same time, he showed everyone the example of the masses in Shandong repairing the Yellow River themselves. At this point, everyone understood the government's difficulties and began to think about repairing it themselves. However, they also felt that the local masses were too selfish, disunited, unorganized, afraid of difficulties, and not as good as the masses in Shandong. They requested that the government issue an order, saying that no one should be allowed to refuse. Comrade Li used many facts to explain that relying on orders would not work. It was necessary to rely on the masses' consciousness. Finally, he agreed to send cadres to help mobilize the masses. Everyone accepted Comrade Li's suggestion and decided to go back and discuss it with the masses to give it a try.
    Two days later, the county formally sent three cadres, all members of the Communist Youth League, to lead the reservoir repair. They did not have much work experience, but they firmly remembered to follow the mass line, not to use coercion and commands, and not to replace the masses with favors. They told the township cadres that the county had not come to lead them before, which was bureaucratic, and had already made a self-criticism. This time, they were determined to lead the masses to overcome the difficulties and repair the river embankment well. When the township cadres heard that the county had made a determination and someone was coming to lead them, their confidence increased. However, they still could not believe in the method of "persuasion and mobilization." The three Youth League members helped everyone think about it and remembered that the principal of the central primary school had a lot of prestige in the township. Later, they also thought of the teachers from various villages, Ah Yu, an old and experienced soil engineer for reservoir repairs, and three rice village cadres who were easy to persuade. It was decided to visit them all.
    With the plan decided, they set out to visit them separately, explaining the government's difficulties, saying that it could take care of the sea embankment but not the river embankment, and now it was determined to lead the masses to repair it themselves. They asked everyone to help persuade and mobilize the masses. The results of the visits were very good. The principal of the central primary school was particularly enthusiastic, saying that he would mobilize the teachers and students of the school to promote it, and he would persuade the masses who lived in the village where the school was located. The teachers from the various schools were also willing to mobilize some of the masses they knew. Ah Yu was willing to take on all engineering plans, allocation, and supervision work.
    The three rice village cadres were quickly persuaded. They understood that repairing the river embankment would prevent tidal water from flowing into the river ditches. First, it would save the rice farmers from draining saltwater, and second, they could harvest more rice. They used this relationship of benefits and harms to persuade other rice farmers and cadres. When the cotton farmers and cadres saw that they were enthusiastically helping to repair the reservoir, they assured them that they would help the rice farmers dig river ditches in the winter. This made the rice farmers and cadres even more satisfied, and it was easier to mobilize others.
    By the third day, more than a dozen village cadres had become activists. Four of the young people with high awareness were introduced to join the Communist Youth League, which made them even more enthusiastic and determined to play a leading role. Among them were cotton farmers and rice farmers. This was the beginning of breaking down barriers and uniting for mutual assistance.
    On that day, a meeting of more than sixty village cadres from all eleven villages in the township was held. These activists played a very good role at the meeting. They explained the relationship between repairing the reservoir and the interests of the rice farmers, and mutually assured that they would repair the reservoir well now and dig the river ditches well in the winter. A young rice farmer member of the Communist Youth League said passionately: "During the Kuomintang era, we were divided into salt land people and fresh land people. Now the Communist Party has educated us and taught us that farmers are all one family. Today, if the cotton farmers are suffering and starving, we rice farmers cannot sit idly by and do nothing!" Most of the rice farmers said that what he said was right. An old man kept complaining because the cotton farmers had taken away his sickle and grass basket. The rice farmers criticized him, saying, "Repairing the reservoir is beneficial to everyone. You can't just talk about your own small matters!" When the old man saw that no one agreed with him, he stopped talking.
    Before the meeting, Ah Yu and the teachers had calculated the land area, population, and allocated the workload and work sections for each village and household. They announced it on the spot at the meeting, asking for everyone's opinions. Everyone said it was fair and reasonable, and there was no bias. They automatically expressed that they would guarantee completion. The principal of the central primary school also said that he would lead all the teachers and students of the school to participate in the reservoir repair labor and compete with everyone. The mood was very high. The township head asked if there were any other difficulties. Everyone said, "Today, the whole township has become a single force, and everyone is coming to repair it, so there are no major difficulties." The grain problem used to be a major difficulty, but now, when the whole township calculates it, each person only has less than three days of work, so the difficulty is very small. For a few households with extreme difficulties, the activists said, "It doesn't matter if we put together a few catties of grain for them!" The rice farmers used to say that they were busy with watering and weeding, but now they are thinking of ways to adjust and say that it is "not a problem." The cotton farmers were in even higher spirits: they automatically offered to lend tools to the rice farmers, and the cotton farmers themselves put together grain to take care of Ah Yu's family life and purchase culvert materials (requiring a total of four hundred catties of rice). They declared on the spot: "We will not let the rice farmers contribute money after contributing labor."
    After this meeting, the village cadres' thoughts were unified. Everyone went back to their respective villages to mobilize the masses and hold large meetings. Once the reasoning was explained, the general masses all agreed that it was good for everyone. Coupled with the promotion by teachers, students, and activists in the past few days, the masses were somewhat mentally prepared, and very few people expressed opposition. Some businessmen were unwilling to participate, and the farmers said to them, "If the farmers suffer a disaster, your business will not be good either." They thought about it and realized that it made sense, so they no longer made excuses. In some rice villages, a small number of people were picky about the slight discrepancies in the allocation of workload and work sections. The village cadres said, "We are all red-footed stalks (farmers), how can we calculate it perfectly!" "You take shifts, and we go every day; you contribute one unit of work, and we contribute ten units of work. Don't worry about it, watch us!" When the masses saw that the cadres were working so hard and were so dedicated to the public, and that there were no major errors in the allocation, they no longer argued.
    In the cotton villages, the cadres generally mobilized the masses to unite with the rice farmers: "Our homes are close to the reservoir, so we can ask our families to boil some tea for everyone to drink from time to time"; "If some rice farmers say angry words and don't work hard, we have to be patient and not get angry"; "Some rice farmers don't know how to repair the reservoir, and they repair it slowly and badly. We have to help them voluntarily and not embarrass them."
    After the official start of construction on June 26th, teachers and students came to participate, beating gongs and drums. The river embankment was very lively. The masses in each work section worked and chatted and joked at the same time. There were few lazy people or unhappy people. Ah Yu worked especially hard because everyone voluntarily took care of his seventy catties of rice. He ran back and forth non-stop, and he carefully directed and corrected even small problems. The women from the cotton farmers' families delivered buckets of fresh tea, and there was tea to drink whenever they wanted it. At noon, the food that everyone brought was cold, and the women took it home to steam it hot and bring it back. If some rice farmers didn't repair it well, the cotton farmers voluntarily worked overtime at night to repair it. The whole township was filled with an atmosphere of love and mutual assistance, and there were no complaints, dissatisfaction, or mutual blaming. The Zhenhai County Committee came to comfort the masses, and the masses said, "We don't feel tired. Last year, the Kuomintang forced us to dig up our ancestors' graves with bayonets, that was really tiring!"
    In order to support the reservoir repair and future production, the principal of the central primary school helped the cadres to persuade households with grain to lend out over 1,500 catties of grain. Township and village cadres and activists also voluntarily lent some grain individually to households in difficulty to eat. Therefore, the grain problem did not affect the reservoir repair project.
    The responsible cadres of each village led the masses on duty to the reservoir every day and worked together. From beginning to end, no one was lazy or didn't go. The seventh village head (a rice farmer) did not eat well at home, but he was unwilling to fall behind at all and stuck to it until the end. They called on each other to observe and compete, encouraging labor enthusiasm, which made work efficiency higher than in any previous year. Ah Yu, who had thirty years of reservoir repair experience, miscalculated this time: he originally calculated that a total of 1,900 labor units would be needed, but in the end, it took less than 1,000 labor units. He did not count on the enthusiasm of the masses. On July 2nd, all 450 zhang of the river embankment were repaired. After the completion, the township selected models, and those elected included cotton farmers and rice farmers, cotton villages and rice villages. The unity of cotton farmers and rice farmers was further consolidated.
    There was still labor remaining, so everyone voluntarily repaired and reinforced what was not in the plan. And along the river south of Zhenhai City, they built a new embankment that was 180 zhang long, shorter and thinner.
    Linjiang Township has since become a township with better work in Zhenhai County.

    临江乡修塘防水
    ——走群众路线的一个例子
    萧容  林韦
    有许多建设必须国家花钱，也有许多建设不一定要国家花钱。有的场合，国家花了钱也能把事情办糟；有的场合，国家不花钱也能把事情办好。这是决定于工作同志怎样领导着群众去办。
    在甬江入海处的北拐角上，有一个乡叫临江乡，属浙江镇海县。隔着县城就是大海。全乡十一个小村，一千多人口。江边五个村，常受潮汛之灾，土是咸的，农民大多数种棉，俗名咸地人。里面六个村，地势高些，又隔着河沟，潮水不容易冲进来，土是淡的，农民大多数种稻，俗名淡地人。
    修塘防水，是临江乡一年一度的大事。小潮汛年头，江塘破损很少，江边棉农随便修补修补也就行了。一到大潮汛年头，江塘破损很大时，困难就来了。棉农急着要修，人手不够；要稻农一块来修，稻农不愿意。不愿意的原因有两个：一个是潮水不容易冲着自己；一个是平常到塘上割牛草时，棉农要来干涉。有几个稻农并且被夺过草篮和镰刀，心里有仇气。所以他们宁愿多去挖挖河沟，蓄水灌稻。
    去年七、八月两次大潮汛，比十多年来那一年都厉害。一千四百多丈江塘，冲毁四百七十多丈。棉田淹完了，棉农遭了重灾。稻田也因为河沟灌满咸水，收成不如往年。为把咸水一斗一斗车出去，还费了好多人工。不过比起棉农的重灾来，稻农就觉得自己没遭什么灾。
    八月大潮汛一过，区干部就跑到临江去召开会议，动员修塘。棉农都愿意，就是稻农怎说也不参加。几个有仇气的一吵叫，差点打起来。会议无结果而散，区干部也从此再不去了。他们说：“这村群众太落后，没法办。”因此，一直延迟到今年春天还没有解决修塘的问题。其后，又经过县水利指挥部的王副指挥出了岔，自作主张地说政府能出粮修，实际是政府困难很大，只能拨粮修海塘，没有力量能顾到江塘。所以，王副指挥的话变成了“空头支票”。而且县级领导机关也因没有办法而对修江塘采取了恶劣的不管态度！
    一直拖到六月十四日，宁波地委李同志到镇海检查县委工作时，发现临江乡的报告，说这事不能不管。县委说没办法，李同志便自己跑到临江，找了几个乡村干部研究。大家一听说还是没粮，都败了兴。没饭吃啦，没工具啦，车水忙啦，时间晚啦，摆出一大堆困难。可是问他们今年不修行不行，又都说不行。怎么办呢？李同志一面给大家计算政府的困难，说明海塘江塘都要政府出粮确实做不到；一面拿山东群众自己修黄河的榜样给大家看。这时候，大家看清了政府的难处，开始有点回心转意，想着自己来修。可是又觉得本地群众私心大，不团结，没组织，怕困难，比不上山东群众。便要求政府下个命令，谁不干也不行。李同志又拿许多事实说明靠命令办不好，一定要靠群众自觉。最后答应派干部来帮助发动群众。大家接受李同志的建议，决定回去先和群众商量一下试试看。
    过了两天，县里正式派了三个干部来领导修塘，都是青年团员。他们工作经验不多，可是牢记着要走群众路线，不能强迫命令，不能恩赐代替。他们告诉乡干部：以前县里没来领导，犯了官僚主义，已经做了检讨。这回下了决心，一定要领导群众克服困难，把江塘修好。乡干部一听县里下了决心，又有人来领导，信心都高了些。就是还不能相信“说服动员”这个办法。三个团员帮大家想了一顿，想起中心小学校长在乡里很有威信。以后又想起各村教员，老有经验的修塘土工程师阿雨，还有三个容易说通的稻农村干部。决定都去访访看。
    计议已定，就分头出去访问，说明政府困难，顾了海塘顾不了江塘，现在决心领导群众自己来修，请大家帮助说服动员群众。访问的结果，成绩很好。中心小学校长特别热心，表示一要动员各校师生去宣传，二要自己去说服学校住村的群众。各校教员，也都愿意去动员一部分熟识的群众。阿雨愿意担负一切工程计划，分配和督导工作。
    三个稻农村干部，也很快就说通了。他们很明白：修好江塘，潮水灌不进河沟，一来省得稻农排咸水，二来稻也能多收些。他们拿这个利害关系，又去说服别的稻农干部。棉农干部见他们热心帮助修塘，就向他们保证冬天帮助稻农挖河。这一来，稻农干部更加满意，动员别人也更有道理了。
    到第三天，有十来个村干部变成了积极分子。其中四个觉悟高的青年，被介绍加入青年团，热情更高，决心起带头作用。里面有棉农也有稻农。这是打破隔阂、团结互助的开端。
    当天召开全乡十一村六十多人的村干部大会，这些积极分子在会上起了很好的作用。他们解说修塘对稻农的利害关系，相互保证现在好好修塘，冬天好好挖河。一个稻农青年团员激昂地说：“国民党时期，我们分成咸地人和淡地人。现在共产党教育我们，懂得了农民都是一家人。今天种棉的遭灾挨饿，我们种稻的也不能坐着不管！”稻农听着，多数都说讲得对。有一个老头因为自己被棉农夺过镰刀草篮，一直叨叨不休。稻农批评他说：“修塘是大家有利，你不能光说自己的小事！”老头一看没人附和，再也不说了。
    阿雨和教员们在开会以前，就计算了各村各户地亩人口，分配好工口、工段。会上当场宣布，征求大家意见。大家都说公平合理，没有偏向。自动表示要保证完成。中心小学校长也表示要率领全校师生参加修塘劳动，和大家比赛。情绪很高。乡长问还有什么困难，大家说：“今天全乡成了一股劲，都来修，没什么大困难。”口粮问题以前是个大困难，现在全乡一算，一个人还轮不到三天工，困难就很小了。有少数十分困难的户，积极分子们说：“凑几斤粮食给他，不要紧！”以前稻农说车水、耘田忙，现在自己想办法调剂，也都说“不成问题”。棉农情绪更高：他们自动提出借工具给稻农使用，由棉农自己凑粮照顾阿雨家里生活，购买涵洞工料（共需四百来斤大米）。当场声明：“不让稻农出了人工再出钱。”
    经过这次会议，村干部的思想一致起来，大家分头回各村动员群众，开大会。道理一讲通，一般群众都承认这事对大家都好。加上几天来教员、学生和积极分子们的宣传，群众中已经有些思想准备，很少人表示反对。有些做生意的不愿意参加，农民对他们说：“种田人遭了灾，你们的生意也做不好。”他们想想道理也对，就不再推托了。有的稻农村少数群众斤斤计较工口、工段分配上一星一点的出入，村干部说：“咱们都是些红脚梗（种田人），那儿能算得一丝不错！”“你们轮班去，我们天天去；你们出一工，我们出十工。不用计较啦，看我们的！”群众见干部这样卖力，这样为公，分配上又没有大不了的差错，也都不再计较了。
    棉农村里，干部对群众普遍进行团结稻农的动员：“咱们家离塘近，可以叫家里时常烧点茶给大家吃”；“如果有些稻农说气话，不卖力，咱们要忍着点，不要动气”；“有些稻农不会修塘，修得慢，修得不好，咱们要自动帮助，别叫他们为难。”
    六月二十六日正式动工以后，教师和学生们敲着锣鼓赶来参加，江塘上非常热闹。各工段群众一面干活，一面说笑打趣，很少有偷懒的和不高兴的。阿雨因为大家自动照顾他七十斤大米，干得特别起劲。来来回回不停地跑，一点点小毛病也认真指拨纠正。棉农家的妇女们满桶满桶送着新茶，什么时候要喝都有。午间，大家带来的饭食凉了，妇女们拿回家去给蒸热送来。有的稻农修不好，夜里棉农自动加班给补修好。全乡充满友爱互助空气，没有了牢骚不满、互相埋怨之声。镇海县委来慰问群众，群众说：“我们不觉得辛苦。去年国民党拿着刺刀逼我们挖祖先坟，才真辛苦哩！”
    为着支援修塘和以后的生产，中心校长帮助干部劝说有粮户，借出一千五百来斤粮食。乡、村干部积极分子也有些自动个别借粮给困难户吃。因而口粮问题并没有影响到修塘工程。
    各村负责干部每天带领轮班的群众上塘，一块作工。从头到尾，没一个偷懒不去的。第七村村长（稻农）家里吃的很不好，也一点不肯落后，一直顶到底。他们号召互相观摩比赛，鼓舞劳动热情，使作工效率比以往那一年都高。阿雨这样有三十年修塘经验的人，这回也算错了账：他原来计算总共需要一千九百工，最后只用了不到一千工。他没有算上群众的积极性。七月二日，四百五十丈江塘就全部修好了。完工后全乡评选模范，当选的有棉农也有稻农，有棉农村也有稻农村。棉农稻农的团结，更加巩固了。
    余工还多，大家又自动把不在计划以内的也补修加固一下。并且沿着镇海城南的江边，修筑了一百八十丈较矮较薄的新塘。
    临江乡从此成了镇海县工作较好的乡了。
