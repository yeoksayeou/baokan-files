Regarding Whether to Publish Farmer Newspapers

I. Comrade Zeng Yanxiu's Letter

Editor:

Since the National Journalism Work Conference in April 1950, some comrades have believed that since it has been affirmed that all newspapers should connect with the masses and place the issue of popularization in an extremely important position, then discussing the creation of popular farmer newspapers is an old viewpoint, which is to say that the major newspapers of the major administrative regions and provinces can remain non-popular. Therefore, this violates the guidelines of the National Journalism Work Conference.

Regarding this issue, I believe it cannot be said this way. I believe that farmer newspapers should still be established in some regions. The reasons are as follows: First, today's major daily newspapers are one or one and a half broadsheets. It is fundamentally impossible for farmers to select what they want to read from such a large amount of space. More than one page of advertisements every day is even more useless, and the waste of paper is also terrible. Moreover, the form of farmer reading material is extremely important. One or one and a half broadsheets, reports of 10,000 to 20,000 words, editorials of 2,000 to 3,000 words… are completely not the style that farmers like; they would be scared off. Who has the ability to "popularize" these things that appear every day? The content is also difficult to handle. For example, many trivial agricultural production knowledge, city people do not read. After a lot of effort to get a lot, how many copies of newspapers reached the countryside and the farmers? Second, in fact, after the Journalism Work Conference, the progress of newspapers is mainly reflected in the content and direction. It must be admitted that the popularization of writing has a certain limit. To make farmers with basic literacy able to understand the major newspapers, the content must be relevant to them, the characters large, the language colloquial, and the matters simple and clear. Even after many years, it will not be possible to achieve this. Can Xinhua News Agency telegrams be rewritten into something farmers can understand in every major newspaper? Can "International Week" be changed to a popular speech of two or three hundred words called "Talking about the General Trend of the World"? Can the struggles in the Security Council be changed to popular news of one or two hundred words in major newspapers? In reality, it is impossible. There are many more things that cannot be changed in major newspapers into something that farmers with basic literacy can understand. Third, the pricing issue is also very serious. Major newspapers cost 15,000 or 21,000 yuan per month. This is already a considerable amount in the city. How can rural governments, primary school teachers, and farmers afford it? How can they be willing to spend so much money to buy seven or eight tenths of something that is unnecessary for them? Due to inconvenient transportation, the price scissors between rural and urban prices in various provinces is very severe. In some places in the Beijiang area of Guangdong, every 100 catties of grain costs more than 20,000 yuan, which can pay for a month's subscription to a newspaper. No matter how wonderful the newspaper is, not only will the farmers not subscribe, but the township government and primary school will also not be able to afford it. How can newspapers go to the countryside? You can shout yourself hoarse, but it won't work. In the last quarter of this year, we originally planned to "strive for the distribution of newspapers to the townships," but due to the needs of various parties, the newspaper must increase by one and a half broadsheets from October 1, and the price must be changed to 700 yuan. In this way, the number of rural subscribers will definitely decrease, which contradicts our political requirements. The post office also said that if the price is increased, the number of copies in rural areas will definitely decrease. In this way, material resources are wasted, but the burden on rural areas is increased, violating the purpose of newspapers going to the countryside.

The situation in the rural areas of Guangdong makes me feel that the establishment of farmer newspapers is even more important. Farmers have a higher level of education, many of whom have basic literacy, and also have the desire to broaden their horizons and understand current affairs. However, it is far from being able to understand newspapers such as People's Daily, Liberation Daily, Yangtze Daily, and Southern Daily. If a farmer newspaper is established, it will exactly meet their needs. It is not like in northern Shaanxi, where even though the border area mass newspaper was established, the farmers still could not understand it. If the farmer newspaper is published every two days, four-open size, one broadsheet, and priced at 200 yuan or 150 yuan, then the monthly cost will be 3,000 yuan or 2,250 yuan. In this way, some farmers can afford it, and farmers in the Jiangzhe area of Guangdong can afford it even more.

I cannot find anything wrong with doing this. Not establishing farmer newspapers is, in fact, abandoning the rural front and farmer readers. The inevitable connection between establishing farmer newspapers and hindering the popularization of major newspapers, I believe, cannot be established. After the reminder of the Journalism Work Conference, it can only encourage major newspapers to learn from popular newspapers. How can it be justified to say that if there is "People's Literature," then "Shuoshuo Changchang" is not needed?

In the new areas south of the Yangtze River, where liberation has been more than a year, the failure to establish farmer newspapers is, I believe, a loss. Last year, when I was in Qingdao, I learned that the Jiaodong farmer newspaper "Qunli Daily" once sold 40,000 copies. It was very popular in counties with a higher level of culture. Approximately, a certain village in Haiyang County once had more than 400 subscribers. I repeatedly asked its负责人, and he said it was absolutely reliable. The newspaper was eight-open size, which made it easier to go to the countryside. Is it possible to promote the current "Dazhong Daily" in that village more than 400 copies if "Qunli Daily" is not established? Obviously, it is impossible.

I hope you will consider and answer this question.

II. Editor's Reply

Comrade Zeng Yanxiu's opinion is correct and conforms to the facts. The opinion of some comrades that since provincial-level and above newspapers target the masses, including farmers, there is no need to establish farmer newspapers is incorrect and does not conform to the facts.

The National Journalism Work Conference affirmed a simple fact that had previously been viewed differently: that all newspapers are for the masses to read. This basic fact must be acknowledged in order to correctly determine the direction and method of newspaper work. There must be a direction and method determined based on this basic fact in order to enable our newspaper workers to maintain a clear understanding in their work, to prevent themselves from being detached from the actual life of the masses, to constantly pay attention to expanding the scope of activities to the masses, and to use the main space to reflect the various figures, wisdom, experiences, and problems produced in the masses.

The basic fact that all newspapers are for the masses to read illustrates that newspapers must be mass-oriented. However, this does not mean that all newspapers must be made understandable to everyone. Some newspapers do require a certain level of education to understand. In some places, there is even a situation where only cadres can understand the newspapers. However, even so, we still cannot say that the newspapers in this region are merely cadre reading materials. Because these newspapers should still mainly reflect the life of the masses rather than the activities of cadres, and should be filled with the voices of the masses rather than mainly publishing the instructions of the authorities, etc. Affirming that all newspapers are for the masses to read does not mean that there is no need for the division of labor of certain professional newspapers. Therefore, if this principle is regarded as we should only have a certain type of generally "for the masses to read" newspaper, and from this, it is inferred that if a province has the province's main newspaper, it is sufficient to connect with all aspects of the masses and meet the needs of all aspects of the masses, and therefore, there is no need for the existence of newspapers that connect with a certain aspect of the masses, such as farmer masses; or that advocating the creation of popular farmer newspapers suitable for the cultural level of farmers is denying the principle that the province's main newspapers should serve the masses, such inferences are incorrect.

The inference that there is no need to establish farmer newspapers departs from three important facts: First, the political content of provincial-level and above main newspapers and the writing used to express this political content are often not understood or read by every ordinary person. Second, the business-oriented operating direction of these newspapers makes it impossible for them to lower prices to a level suitable for farmers' purchasing power. Third, farmers are the most numerous, and they also have their own special needs politically and culturally.

It is very difficult to require provincial-level and above main newspapers to be as understandable to everyone as popular newspapers. Their existing political content first limits their progress in this regard. And since they are published once a day, it is truly not easy to conduct popularization rewriting work on the large amount of diverse news and materials received every day. Therefore, we believe that under possible conditions, it is better for each province to separately publish popular and low-priced non-daily newspapers aimed at farmers or increase the number of newspapers below the provincial level, as weapons to educate farmers and improve their political and cultural level, than for provincial-level and above major newspapers to take on two roles at once. In provinces where the general cultural level of the people is relatively low, it is obviously much better to change the provincial newspaper into a farmer newspaper or a newspaper mainly aimed at farmers than to retain a newspaper with few readers and difficult to continue to penetrate the masses. In some regions, after having a major newspaper, they no longer publish newspapers of the same nature but publish farmer newspapers, which is also a reasonable way to take care of farmer readers.

Farmer newspapers are of great importance. The articles by Stalin and Kalinin on farmer newspapers published in this issue of "News Work" can give us a very profound impression on this point.

The current situation of farmer newspapers in various parts of our country also illustrates the huge need of the farmer masses for newspapers. Taking Shandong Rural Dazhong Daily as an example, the actual sales volume in September 1950 was 97,481 copies (not including newspapers used for exchange, posting, and gifting). This is a sales volume that no other provincial newspaper has yet reached. Shandong Rural Dazhong Daily was published in May 1950. In May, Shandong "Dazhong Daily" distributed more than 39,000 copies, and after June, it decreased somewhat, distributing more than 37,000 copies. From June to September, it generally maintained this number and did not continue to decrease. This proves that the distribution of the province's farmer newspaper has basically not greatly reduced the distribution of the local major newspaper. There is no contradiction between its coexistence with the local major newspaper. Regarding the reader composition of farmer newspapers, the report of Shandong Rural Dazhong Daily states: "According to the distribution statistics of the post office, 46,285 copies were subscribed by village governments, 10,145 copies were subscribed by village mass organizations, 2,008 copies were subscribed by rural cooperatives and other production organizations, 21,471 copies were subscribed by rural primary schools, and 2,630 copies were subscribed by individual farmers. The above totals 82,539 copies, all of which are sent to the villages, that is, mainly farmer readers subscribe to the newspaper (including village cadres), with 51,068 copies, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total distribution. If rural primary schools are excluded, then 51,068 copies are distributed to the villages, accounting for more than 55 percent of the total distribution." We also do not have any newspaper that has so many copies distributed to the villages, and the proportion of farmer readers in the total number of readers is so large.

Shandong is an old area, and farmer newspapers naturally have many farmer readers. Even in the new area, the distribution quantity of farmer newspapers is also quite large, and the readers are mainly farmers. For example, Zhejiang's Farmer Dazhong Daily distributes 14,870 copies. In August, there were 3,000 villages in the province with Zhejiang Daily, while Farmer Dazhong Daily had 4,000 villages, that is, at least 1,000 villages where Zhejiang Daily could not be distributed but Farmer Dazhong Daily could be distributed.

This kind of farmer newspaper has a good impact on rural production and the learning of farmer readers. The Heilongjiang Farmer Newspaper, which once distributed more than 40,000 copies, reported in October: "Because the newspaper strives to be popular and easy to understand, 'only publishes farming matters' (in the words of the farmers), it has been welcomed by the readers. From the more than 300 letters we have recently received, most of the readers have expressed their welcome to this small newspaper. Now, the vast majority of reading groups in rural areas are reading farmer newspapers. The readers' submissions and letters say that farmer newspapers often introduce production experiences, conduct commendations and criticisms, and have played a certain role in promoting production. … A large part of rural readers, including a part of district cadres with low cultural levels, also regard farmer newspapers as reading materials for cultural learning." The work report of Shanxi Farmer Newspaper over the past year described the newspaper's impact on readers, saying: "Judging from the readers' opinions, the influence of agricultural technical guidance is the deepest. The second is the publicity of the Marriage Law. Because of seizing the divorce incident of Lü Duihua and conducting concentrated and continuous reports and discussions, it still left an impression among the masses. The third is the publicity of the direction of mutual assistance production and getting rich. The fourth is the explanation of rural production policies. The fifth is current affairs publicity." The readers' reflection on the Shanxi Farmer Newspaper is: "The newspaper drilled into the mountains, and the farmers opened their eyes." "With farmer newspapers, the work is easy to lead."

The experience of Shandong Rural Dazhong Daily has this point: "In running a mass newspaper at the provincial level, the editorial department has very few opportunities to directly contact district and village work and the masses." This experience illustrates the importance of gradually establishing newspapers below the provincial level in the future (in terms of the order of development, the first is the special district level newspaper). Newspapers below the provincial level will expand the reader base of the provincial-level farmer newspaper. And the development of farmer newspapers throughout the province (including provincial-level and below) – that is, the improvement of the political and cultural level of farmers – will result in nothing else but the expansion of the reader base of the provincial newspaper. The expansion of the reader base of the provincial newspaper will undoubtedly require the continued strengthening of the mass character of the work of the provincial newspaper.

专栏：

    关于应否出版农民报纸
    一、曾彦修同志的来信编辑同志：
    一九五○年四月全国新闻工作会议以后，有些同志以为既然肯定了任何报纸均要联系群众并把通俗化问题放在极重要地位，则再谈办通俗的农民报，即是旧观点，也即是说各大行政区与省的主要报纸仍可不通俗，因而这便是违反全国新闻工作会议的方针的。
    关于这个问题，我以为不能这样说。我认为在某些地区仍应办农民报。理由如下：第一、今天的各大日报一大张或一张半，要农民从这样大的篇幅中，选择他要看的，根本不可能，每天一版以上的广告更无用，纸张的浪费也可怕。而且农民读物，形式问题十分重要，一大张或一张半，一二万字的报告、二三千字的社论……完全不是农民喜欢的派头，吓都把他们吓住了，谁有本事把这些天天都有的东西“通俗化”呢？内容也很难搞，例如很多琐屑的农业生产知识，城市人不看，费了很大劲弄了许多，有几张到了农村和农民手里呢？其次，事实上，新闻工作会议后，报纸的进步，主要表现在内容上、方针上，不能不承认文字的通俗化有一定限度，要粗通文字的农民看得懂大报，内容都与他有关，字大，口语化，事情简单明了等，再过若干年也办不到。新华社电讯能否在大报上每条都改成农民看的懂的呢？“国际一周”能否都改为“话说天下大势”二三百字的通俗讲话呢？安理会的斗争能否在大报上都改为一二百字的通俗消息呢？实际是不可能的，其他不可能在大报上改为粗通文字的农民看的懂的还多的很。第三，定价问题也很严重，大报每月一万五或二万一千元，在城市已经数目不小了，乡村政权、小学教师和农民如何买的起呢？如何愿意拿这么多钱去买十分之七八对他都是没有必要的东西呢？交通不便，各省，农村城市物价剪刀差十分厉害，广东北江区有些地方每百斤谷二万余元，可订报一月，任你报纸天花乱坠，不但农民不会订报，乡政府也订不起、小学校也订不起。报纸如何下乡？叫破喉咙也不行。今年最后一季，我们本拟“为报纸发行到乡而奋斗”，但由于各方面的需要，报纸须于十月一号起增出一张半，定价即得改为七百元。这样，农村订户一定减少，与我们的政治要求矛盾。邮局也说，如果加价，农村份数一定减少。这样，浪费了物力，却又增加了农村的负担，违反报纸下乡的目的。
    广东农村情况，使我觉得创办农民报纸更为重要。农民文化程度较高，很多人粗通文字，也有开眼界通晓时务的要求。但要能看得懂人民、解放、长江、南方等报则差得远，如办一农民报则恰合他们的需要，不似在陕北时，虽办边区群众报，农民仍看不懂。农民报如每两日出版四开一张，定价二百元或百五十元，则月需三千元或二千二百五十元，如此有些农民尚可负担，广东江浙一带农民更可负担。
    这样做，我不能发现有什么不好。不办农民报，事实上是放弃农村阵地和农民读者。办农民报即妨碍大报的通俗化的必然关联，我以为是不能成立的，经过新闻工作会议的提醒，只能鼓励大报向通俗报学习。如说有了“人民文学”就可不要“说说唱唱”，如何能说的通呢？
    长江以南新区，解放已一年余，未办农民报，我以为是一损失。去年我在青岛，得知胶东农民报“群力报”曾销四万余份，文化较高各县很流行，大约是海阳县某村曾有四百余订户，我再三询问其负责人，说是绝对可靠的，该报八开，更易下乡，是否不办“群力报”就可把目前的“大众日报”在该村也能推行四百多份呢，显然是不能的。
    这个问题，我希望你们考虑并答复。
  二、编者的答复
    曾彦修同志的意见是对的，合乎事实的。而有些同志认为省级以上报纸既然都以包括农民在内的群众为对象就无需再办农民报纸的意见是不对的，不合事实的。
    全国新闻工作会议肯定了一个简单的但是从前曾经有不同看法的事实，这就是：一切报纸都是给群众看的。必须承认这个基本事实，才能正确地决定报纸工作的方针和方式。必须有根据这个基本事实定出来的方针和方式，才能使我们的报纸工作者在工作中保持明确的思想，使自己不脱离群众生活的实际，经常注意把活动范围扩大到群众中去，并以主要的篇幅来反映群众中所产生的种种人物、智慧、经验和问题。
    一切报纸都是给群众看的这个基本事实说明了报纸必须是群众性的。但这并不等于说一切报纸必须做到使每个人都能看懂，有一些报纸确要有一定的文化水平才能看懂，有的地方甚至有这样的情形，即只有干部才能看懂报纸。然而即令如此，我们仍不能说这个地区的报纸只是干部读物。因为这种报纸仍应该主要是反映群众的生活而不是干部的活动，应该充满群众的声音而不是主要刊载机关的指令等。肯定一切报纸都是给群众看的，也不等于不需要某些专业报纸的分工。因此，如果把这个原则看成我们只应该有某一种一般地“给群众看的”报纸，由此加以推论说，一个省里有了省的主要报纸便足以联系各方面的群众，满足各方面群众的要求，因而联系某一方面群众如农民群众的报纸即无存在之必要；或者说主张办通俗的适合农民文化水平的农民报纸便是否认省的主要报纸应该为群众服务的原则，这样的推论都是不正确的。
    认为不要办农民报纸的推论离开了三个重要的事实：第一是省级以上主要报纸的政治内容和他们用以表达这种政治内容的文字常不是每一个老百姓所能听懂和读懂的。第二是这些报纸的企业化经营方针使他们不可能降低定价到适合农民的购买力。第三是农民人数最多，而他们在政治上和文化上也有他们自己的特殊的需要。
    要求省级以上主要报纸像通俗报纸一样作到人人能懂是十分困难的事。他们现有的政治内容首先就限制了他们在这一方面的进展。而他们又是每天出版一次的，要对每天所收到的大量的、内容多样的新闻和材料进行通俗化的改写工作，着实不易。因此，我们以为在可能的条件下，各省另出以农民为对象的通俗的和定价低廉的非日刊或增加省级以下报纸，作为教育农民群众提高其政治文化水平的武器，比较由省级以上大报一身而二任的办法要好一些。在人民文化水平一般地比较低的省份，把省报改变为农民报纸或主要是以农民为对象的报纸，显然要比保留一种读者很少且难于继续深入群众的报纸好得多。有的地区有了一种大报就不再出同样性质的报纸而出版农民报纸，也是一个照顾农民读者的合理的办法。
    农民报纸有很大的重要性。本期“新闻工作”所发表的斯大林和加里宁关于农民报纸的论文，在这一点上，可以给予我们以很深刻的印象。
    目前我国各地农民报纸的状况也说明农民群众对于报纸的巨大的需要。以山东农村大众报为例。该报一九五○年九月份实销九万七千四百八十一份（交换、张贴、赠送用的报纸不在内）。这是目前任何一种省报都还没有达到的销数。山东农村大众报是在一九五○年五月间出版的。五月份山东“大众日报”发行三万九千多份，六月以后减少了一些，发行三万七千多份。六月至九月大体上保持着这个数目，没有继续减少。这就证明，省的农民报纸的发行基本上没有大量减少当地大报的发行，它和当地大报的并存没有矛盾。关于农民报纸的读者成份，山东农村大众报的报告中说：“根据邮局发行统计，计村政订阅四万六千二百八十五份，村群众团体订阅一万零一百四十五份，农村合作社等生产组织订阅二千零八份，农村小学订阅二万一千四百七十一份，农民个人订阅二千六百三十份，以上共计八万二千五百三十九份，均系发到村的，即主要是农民读者订报（包括村干部）五万一千零六十八份，占发行总数百分之七十强。如除去农村小学，则发行到村的五万一千零六十八份，占发行总数百分之五十五强。”我们也还没有一种报纸有这样多份数发行到村，农民读者在全体读者中所占比例这样大。
    山东是老区，农民报纸的农民读者固然很多，就是在新区，农民报纸的发行数量也相当大，并且读者主要是农民。例如浙江的农民大众报，发行一万四千八百七十份，八月份全省有三千个村有浙江日报，而农民大众报则有四千个村，即至少有一千个村是浙江日报发行不到而农民大众报可以发行得到的。
    这种农民报纸对农村生产和农民读者的学习有着很好的影响。曾经发行到四万份以上的黑龙江农民报在十月份报告中说：“因为报纸力求做到通俗浅白，‘净登庄稼事’（农民的话），受到了读者的欢迎。从我们最近收到的三百多封来信看，大部分读者都表示欢迎这种小报。现在农村里的读报组绝大多数是读的农民报。读者的来稿和来信说，农民报经常介绍生产经验、进行表扬和批评，对生产起了一定的推动作用。……很大一部分农村读者包括一部分文化低的区干部在内，还把农民报当作文化学习的读物。”山西农民报一年来工作报告中叙述该报在读者中的影响说：“从读者意见来看，以农事技术指导的影响为最深。第二是婚姻法的宣传，由于抓住了吕堆花离婚事件，进行了集中的和连续的报道和讨论，现在仍在群众中留下了印象。第三是互助生产发家致富的方向的宣传。第四是农村生产政策的解释。第五是时事宣传。”读者对山西农民报的反映是：“报纸钻了山，农民开了眼。”“有了农民报，工作好领导。”
    山东农村大众报的经验中有这样一点：“在省办群众性报纸，编辑部直接接触区村工作和群众的机会很少。”这个经验说明了今后逐步建立省级以下报纸（就发展的次序而言，首先是专区级报纸）的重要性。省级以下报纸将为省级的农民报纸扩大其读者群众。而全省农民报纸（包括省级和省级以下）的发展——亦即农民政治文化水平的提高，其结果将不是别的，而是省报读者群众的扩大。省报读者群众的扩大，无疑地将要求省报工作的群众性的继续加强。
