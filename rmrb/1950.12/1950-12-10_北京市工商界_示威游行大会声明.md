    Statement of the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Demonstration Rally

    The temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pyongyang, which was occupied by the American imperialist bandits for forty-seven days, has returned to the embrace of the Korean people. More than 400,000 people in Pyongyang have regained their free, democratic, and happy lives. We, the industrialists and merchants of Beijing, extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Korean people, especially the Korean People's Army, with immense joy.

    The liberation of Pyongyang, the "Democratic Capital" of Korea, is of great significance. Militarily, it has clearly reversed the difficult situation the enemy faced after the Inchon landing, delivering a strong head-on blow to the imperialist war-mongers. Will the enemies of Korea surrender or die? Or will they get out of Korea? Let the enemies choose for themselves! But the war-mongers will hardly wake up immediately. Our people's iron fists must continue to strike them constantly until their flames of aggression are completely extinguished.

    The entire industrial and commercial circles of the capital are rejoicing and encouraged by this great victory. We feel infinite admiration and congratulations for the brilliant achievements of the brave Chinese and Korean warriors. To celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang and oppose American imperialist aggression, we have gathered here today to hold an unprecedented large-scale parade in the history of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles to demonstrate to the imperialists. We have sent telegrams to Chairman Mao, Representative Wu Xiuquan, General Kim Il-sung, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers to express our feelings and will. Because of this great victory, we are even more determined to expand and strengthen the manpower and material resources we contribute, on the one hand, to support the people's soldiers at the front in Korea, and on the other hand, to strengthen our country's national defense. In terms of supporting policies, completing tasks, stepping up production, and stabilizing prices, we must achieve more significant and concrete results. In terms of comfort, we must show greater love and richer material expressions. In the future, we will work even harder, regardless of the front or the rear, making all our work revolve around the goal of resisting America and aiding Korea, completely eliminating the aggressors, and achieving our lofty and glorious mission of defending our homes and our country.

    北京市工商界
    示威游行大会声明
    被美帝强盗们盘踞了四十七天的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都平壤，重新回到朝鲜人民的怀抱了，四十多万平壤人民重新恢复了自由民主幸福的生活，我们北京市工商业者敬以万分愉快的心情，向朝鲜人民、特别是朝鲜人民军致以热烈的祝贺。
    朝鲜“民主之京”——平壤的光复，是有着很大意义的。在军事上显然地把敌人在仁川登陆后的困难战局扭转过来了，给了帝国主义战争贩子们一个强烈的迎头棒喝。今后朝鲜的敌人是投降或死亡呢？还是滚出朝鲜呢？让敌人自己去选择罢！但是战争贩子将很难立刻觉悟，我们人民的铁拳，还要继续不断地打击它们，直到他们的侵略火焰完全被扑灭为止。
    首都全体工商业者，为这伟大的胜利而欢腾鼓舞。我们对于英勇的中朝勇士们的光辉灿烂的功绩，更感到无限的崇敬和祝贺。为了庆祝平壤解放和反对美帝侵略，我们今天集合在一起，举行了一个在北京工商界历史上空前未有的大规模游行，向帝国主义者示威。我们向毛主席、伍修权代表、金日成将军、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队发出代电表明我们的心情和意志。由于这次大捷，我们更决心扩大和加强我们贡献的人力和物力，一面支援朝鲜前方的人民战士们，一面增强我们国家的国防力量。在拥护政策、完成任务、加紧生产、稳定物价各方面，我们要取得更显著更具体的效果。在慰劳方面，我们要拿出更大的热爱精神和更丰富的物质表现来。今后我们更将不分前方后方，使一切工作环绕着抗美援朝的目标而努力，彻底消灭侵略者，达成我们保家卫国的崇高的光荣的使命。
