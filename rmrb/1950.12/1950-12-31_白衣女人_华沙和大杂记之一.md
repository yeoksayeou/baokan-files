    White-Clothed Woman
    —Notes from Warsaw and Miscellany, Part 1
    Xiao San
        
    Storm-like applause
    Rang out in wave after wave…
    Eighty-odd kinds of people's languages,
    Three thousand-odd voices of jubilation
    Directed towards a white-clothed woman.
    She stood on the podium (seeming taller),
    Continually nodding to the assembly.
    Now and then, clasping her own hands,
    She raised them high above her head,
    Extended them forward—
    Expressing her gratitude to the assembly,
    And hoping the audience would settle down.
    But the shouting in the hall grew more vigorous:
    "Long live the heroic Korean people!"
    "Kim Il-sung!" "Kim Il-sung!" "Kim Il-sung!"
    At this moment, several thousand small red silk handkerchiefs painted with white doves
    (Gifts from the Chinese to the delegates)
    Waved in the air above the hall,
    Like thousands of red flowers blooming, fluttering.
    Finally, quiet. Quiet. Quiet—
    Everyone listened quietly to Park Jung-ae's voice as she spoke.
    Her voice was loud and full of pathos.
    Her voice was indignant and sorrowful.
    She began by speaking of the Soviet army liberating her country,
    People felt gratitude to Stalin from the bottom of their hearts!
    Gratitude to the Soviet Union—the strong fortress of democracy and peace!
    Gratitude to Stalin—the great savior of mankind!
    She spoke of the Korean people's five years of peaceful construction,
    People felt glad from the bottom of their hearts.
    She denounced the American brigands' aggressive ambitions
    And the heinous crimes of the American-Li clique,
    People listened and gnashed their teeth in hatred!
    She recounted the Korean people's heroism and spirit of sacrifice,
    People listened with joy, encouragement, and heartfelt respect.
    She mentioned that the Chinese people had extended a giant hand of support,
    And the hall erupted again in a storm of applause.
    More than three thousand people stood up as one,
    Shouting repeatedly: "Mao Zedong!" "Mao Zedong!" "Mao Zedong!"
    When Park Jung-ae finished shouting the last slogan,
    The hall was like a roaring ocean again.
    Dozens, hundreds of delegates left their seats,
    Rushing to the podium to cheer her.
    Black, white, and yellow female delegates embraced and kissed her.
    Layer upon layer of people surrounded her.
    A flower headscarf was taken from a Hungarian woman's head and placed on hers.
    A woolen shawl was taken from a Brazilian woman's shoulder and draped over hers.
    Countless commemorative gifts were stuffed into her hands.
    Everyone lifted her high.
    Many people were moved to tears…
    Finally, the white-clothed woman was back on the ground—
    The Chinese delegates came forward to shake her hand again,
    And carried her to the front of the Chinese delegation's seats.
    The entire hall saw a realistic symbol:
    The Chinese and Korean people are the closest of sisters and brothers.
    By the time people carried her back to her original place on the presidium,
    The hall's enthusiasm had reached its peak!
    You ask: Why do people all over the world love the Chinese and Korean people so much?
    It is because they stand on the front line against aggression today.
    Don't you see? The sympathy of all honest and kind people in the world
    Stands on the side of the Korean and Chinese people.
    MacArthur and Truman, Attlee and Acheson, listen:
    You petty rogues and pitiful worms,
    Can you not tremble with fear when you see this scene?
    Let me tell you: your days of rampaging are numbered,
    Soon you will be brought before the people's court.
    The power of hundreds of millions of organized people is infinite.
    Delegates from eighty countries have formulated a fighting program.
    Let the Chinese and Korean people chop off the American imperialists' dog legs in Asia!
    Let the Asian people decide the fate of their own history.
    The people have the means to extinguish the great fire of aggressive war.
    The people have the power to defend lasting world peace!

    白衣女人
    ——华沙和大杂记之一
    萧三        
    暴风雨似的掌声
    拍了一阵，又是一阵……
    八十多种人民的语言，
    三千多个欢呼的声音
    向着一个白衣女人。
    她站在讲坛上（似乎长高了些），
    不断地向会众点头。
    一会又自己握住双手，
    向头上高举，
    向前面伸出——
    表示她对会场的答谢，
    并希望会众坐定。
    但会场里喊得更加起劲：
    “万岁，英雄的朝鲜人民！”
    “金日成！”“金日成！”“金日成！”
    这时候几千块画着白鸽的红绸小手巾
    （这是中国人给代表们的赠品）
    在会场的上空挥舞，
    就象几千朵红花怒放，飘动。
    好容易肃静下来了。肃静。肃静——
    大家静听朴正爱发言的声音。
    她的声音响亮，悲壮。
    她的声音悲愤，沉痛。
    她从苏军解放了她的祖国讲起，
    人们从心底深处感激斯大林！
    感激苏联——民主和平的坚强堡垒！
    感激斯大林——世界人类的伟大救星！
    她讲到朝鲜人民五年的和平建设，
    人们从心底深处觉得高兴。
    她控诉美国强盗的侵略野心
    和美李匪帮的滔天罪行，
    人们听了个个切齿痛恨！
    她述说朝鲜人民的英勇和牺牲精神，
    人们听了欢欣，鼓舞，衷心尊敬。
    她说到中国人民伸出了支援的巨手，
    会场里又掀起了暴风雨的掌声。
    三千多人象一个人似的站了起来，
    不断地喊：“毛泽东！”“毛泽东！”“毛泽东！”  
    朴正爱喊完了最后一句口号，
    会场里又象卷起了万顷波涛。
    几十个，几百个代表离开了座位，
    奔向讲坛，向她欢呼。
    黑种白种黄种的女代表们抱她亲她。
    一层又一层的人们把她围住。
    花的头巾从匈牙利女人的头上戴到她的头上了。
    毛织的披肩从巴西女人的肩上披到她的肩上了。  
    无数的纪念礼物塞到她的手里了。
    大家把她高高地抬了起来。
    许多的人感动得流下泪来………
    好容易白衣女人终于着地了——
    中国代表们又走来向她伸手，
    又把她抬到中国人的席位前面。
    整个会场看出一个现实的象征：
    中朝两国人民就是最亲切的姊妹兄弟。
    等到人们把她抬回主席团的原位，
    会场的热血已经沸腾到了极点！  
    你问：为什么全世界的人民这样热爱中朝人民？
    就因他们今天站在反侵略的最前线。
    你不见么？世上一切正直善良人民的同情
    都站在朝鲜和中国人民这方面。
    麦克阿瑟和杜鲁门，艾德礼和艾奇逊听着：
    你们这些渺小的流氓和可怜虫，
    看看这个场面能不胆战心惊？
    告诉你们：你们猖狂的日子不多了，
    很快就要你们上这人民的法庭。
    十万万有组织的人民的力量无穷无尽。
    八十个国家的代表制出了战斗的纲领。
    让中朝人民斩断美帝在亚洲的狗腿！
    让亚洲人民决定自己历史的命运。
    人民有办法熄灭侵略战争的大火。
    人民有力量坚守世界持久的和平！
