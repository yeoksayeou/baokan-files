    Publications on Land Reform
    Chang Feng
    To welcome the land reform movement, Shanghai has published many books on land reform. It is commendable that the publishing industry can cooperate with this great revolutionary historical task to carry out publishing work. However, precisely because the issue is significant and the impact is far-reaching, we must be very cautious in carrying out this work. As early as July, the "Reading and Publishing" supplement of Shanghai Ta Kung Pao criticized the unhealthy tendencies in the publication of such books. This journal has also received submissions from several readers and has also seen several of these books. Taken together, very few of these publications are satisfactory, but there are many with partial errors and serious errors. In order to stop the influence of some very harmful erroneous opinions and to correct some publishers' unsound practices in this type of publishing work, we feel that it should be reviewed. Policy readings should be approached cautiously. The land reform movement is of utmost importance, and the compilation and publication must be extremely prudent. However, many of the publications we have seen show an extremely careless and irresponsible phenomenon.
    "Questions and Answers for Studying the Land Reform Law," compiled by Ye Minghua and published by Shanghai Practical Publishing House, is a typical example of such a hastily published book. This book was published in July, so it naturally could not be compiled based on the "Decision on the Division of Rural Class Components" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government on August 4th. However, it was compiled based on the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China" passed by the Central People's Government Committee on June 28th. This Land Reform Law clearly stipulates that "the legal definition of rural social class components will be determined separately." The compiler also stated on page 58 of this book that the method of analyzing classes in the "Decision of the CCP Central Committee on Two Documents of 1933" "is not very suitable." Therefore, readers have reason to demand that today's land reform readings should not be compiled according to old documents that are known to be no longer very suitable. However, in reality, this book is still compiled according to the old class division documents, and therefore, many errors that could have been avoided occurred. Even sentences that were clearly stipulated in the Land Reform Law itself have been arbitrarily deleted in this book. For example, the Land Reform Law Article 6 defines semi-landlord-type rich peasants as "those who rent out a large amount of land exceeding the amount of land they cultivate themselves and employ others to cultivate." This book omits the words "a large amount."
    Due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of the laws and regulations, some errors have also occurred. For example, in the question and answer "Which lands should be confiscated and requisitioned," the article stipulated in Article 6, which also discusses the confiscation and requisition of land, namely, the provision that a small amount of land owned by rich peasants may be requisitioned in part or in whole with the approval of the provincial-level people's government, is missing. This naturally cannot give readers a complete understanding of this issue. This provision was incorporated into the question "Whether to retain a large amount of land rented out by semi-landlord-style rich peasants." This is inappropriate, because rich peasants who rent out a small amount of land are not semi-landlord-style rich peasants.
    In fact, the errors in this book, large and small, are too numerous to count. For example, it uses Vice Chairman Liu's report to explain the relationship of rural land ownership. The original report stated that the poor peasants, hired peasants, middle peasants, and other people, who account for 90% of the rural population, only own 20% to 30% of the land. Here, it is mistakenly stated as "Generally speaking, the poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants, who account for 80% of the population..." This may be a proofreading error, but in another place, it says, "In North China and Northeast China, landlords and rich peasants account for 16% of the households," and "Poor peasant households account for more than 80%." This figure is very unreliable. Individual survey figures should not be taken as general figures for "North China and Northeast China," and it obviously contradicts the previous figures. Which figure should the reader believe? If landlords and rich peasants account for 16% of the peasant households, and poor peasants account for more than 80%, where have the middle peasants and hired peasants gone? Quoting many conflicting figures without even the most basic checks is one of the reasons for the many errors in this book. For example, it says, "The rice yield per hectare is 22.7 kilograms in the United States, 35.9 kilograms in Japan, and only 18.9 kilograms in China." One hectare is approximately equal to 15 mu, so the rice yield per mu in China is only 1.5 kilograms, which defies common sense. Even more erroneous is the statement that after land reform, farmers' grain "after a portion is paid to the state in the form of taxes, farmers can retain at least 30% to 60%." Thus, the taxes taken by the state from farmers reach 40% to 70% of farmers' income, which is completely untrue. For example, the Chinese Communist Party convened a national land conference in October 1947, but this book mistakenly states that it was in 1948.
    A writer for Ta Kung Pao's "Reading and Publishing" has correctly pointed out: "Land reform is a complex and arduous issue. From a vertical perspective, the land law outline published in the past land revolution era and even in 1947 is not applicable today. From a horizontal perspective, the methods in area A are not suitable for area B, and the methods in area C are not suitable for area D." However, many books rashly treat individual experiences as universal laws, and do not even indicate the source of the quotations. This kind of subjectivism is extremely harmful to practical work. "Questions and Answers for Studying the Land Reform Law" has also made many such mistakes. For example, in the question and answer "What steps should be taken to distribute the fruits of struggle," it says: "Let landlords and rich peasants submit a list to self-report their land property, then investigate and register it, and temporarily hand it over to the landlord himself for safekeeping." Needless to say, these specific steps can be completely different in different places. The compiler already knows that today's policy is to preserve rich peasants, but still ambiguously refers to landlords and rich peasants together. This proves that the editing work is very sloppy and has not undergone basic thinking. Moreover, the experience itself is extremely doubtful. It does not mention at all what correct attitude the peasants in struggle should take towards this landlord self-reporting. Can we unilaterally believe in the landlord's self-reporting? And can we actually entrust the fruits of struggle to the custodianship of the targets of struggle?
    In the section "Why Unite with Middle Peasants" in "Basic Reader on the Land Reform Law" compiled by Li Luomo and published by Zhengfeng Publishing House, Chairman Mao's words are distortedly quoted: "All middle peasants can become reliable allies of the proletariat and are one of the good revolutionary forces in the current stage of the Chinese revolution." These words come from "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party." However, in reality, Chairman Mao said this: "All middle peasants can become reliable allies of the proletariat. The middle peasants are one of the good revolutionary forces." There is obviously a considerable difference between the original text and the quotation. There must be a basic sense of responsibility in quoting classical texts, and unauthorized additions and deletions are not allowed. This should be brought to the attention of publishers and authors once again.
    "Basic Reader on the Land Reform Law" is a very crude book. The main text is only a little over 10,000 words, but more than 6,000 words are used to repeatedly narrate the nature of the Chinese revolution, and less than 5,000 words actually discuss the Land Reform Law. It even pieced together some statistics on foreign trade. A few pages of "Brief Explanation of Terms" are added at the end of the book, most of which are irrelevant to the land reform issue. How can a book that rarely actually discusses the Land Reform Law be called "Basic Reader on the Land Reform Law"? This is obviously an unhealthy style of making impure motivations. In many places in the book, it appears that the author lacks sufficient economic knowledge. For example, it says, "Now that China has 50 million spindles, it needs 43 million catties of cotton from agriculture every day." In reality, China currently has less than 10 million spindles. It also says, "If the amount of cotton in rural areas exceeds the needs of industry by several times, won't industrial production be greatly improved and developed?" Even without looking at it from the perspective of Marxist-Leninist economics, this kind of argument is unreasonable, because the use of cotton outside of industry generally has its limits. If raw cotton production exceeds industrial needs by "several times," it will undoubtedly lead to overproduction, which is not conducive to agriculture or industry. An author should do some basic research on the issues being addressed in order to be of some benefit to the readers. This is not an overly high demand, and it is also necessary to overcome some of the chaotic state of the current publishing industry.
    Mr. Jiao Shixiong sent a letter from Baoji, Shaanxi, criticizing the errors in the definition of rich peasants and hired peasants in "Questions and Answers for Studying the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China" compiled by Feng Sen and published by Shanghai Wengong Bookstore. The letter said that this book is widely sold in the Northwest. In Baoji alone, there are about several hundred copies. It calls rich peasants "farmers who own more land and manage and cultivate it themselves. They are not exploited by landlords, or rent a small amount, but are less exploited by landlords, so their lives are better than those of middle peasants." This is indeed an error of principle. Rich peasants here seem to have become independent laboring farmers or even exploited. Of course, we should implement a policy of preserving rich peasants, which is conducive to the development of the social economy. However, rich peasants are still a type of capitalist exploiter, and therefore cannot simply be called farmers who manage and cultivate on their own. Rich peasants in China often have a semi-feudal nature and have some feudal exploitative relations, which cannot be ignored. Ambiguous class definitions of rich peasants will not enable readers to understand the spirit of the entire land reform policy. This is actually clearly stipulated in all class division documents. The definition of hired peasants in the book is: "Employed laborers who do not have their own land and labor tools but help landlords or rich peasants cultivate the land." This also does not clearly state the class essence of hired peasants being exploited. According to the criticism in Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's "Reading and Publishing," this book also has other errors, such as saying that "middle peasants account for 80% of the total number of peasant classes." These errors are actually easy to find, and there are written records to check. We feel that if one is a responsible compiler, it is entirely possible to avoid them.
    Mr. Liu Zhicheng wrote an article introducing the book "How to Carry Out Land Reform" compiled by Zhou Nong and published by Shanghai Popular Culture Publishing House. After reading the original book, we feel that it is indeed different from other pamphlets. The language is very popular, and the compilation attitude is responsible. It is basically compiled according to the order of the Land Law, avoiding the problem of fragmentation, and thus maintaining a general integrity. However, because the land reform policy is an extremely difficult subject to handle, there are still some individual important errors. For example, the author explains the difference between "requisition" and "confiscation," believing that "confiscation" has a compulsory nature, while "requisition" is "adopting the method of persuasion and mobilization to seek the consent of those being requisitioned to voluntarily take out the land." This statement is wrong and without basis. The Land Reform Law is a decree promulgated by the state. Whether it is requisition or confiscation, it must have a compulsory nature. The state requisitions land according to law (either with compensation or without compensation, here it is without compensation), and it is absolutely not necessary to obtain the consent of the requisitioned party. Of course, the requisitioned party has absolutely no reason to refuse requisition. The difference between confiscation and requisition lies in the fact that confiscation is a revolutionary means taken against the enemies of the revolution, while requisition is a legal obligation borne by the people for the interests of the entire country and the people. This is originally a common practice of national legal rights. Many new democratic countries in Southeast Europe have such provisions in their constitutions. For example, the Albanian constitution has such a provision: "If required for social interests, private property may be restricted and expropriated, but it must be carried out in accordance with special laws."
    If we demand even higher standards, then, in all publications, when talking about the various restrictions of policies and laws, insufficient attention is paid or even completely ignored to Vice Chairman Liu's report, which stated that "Land reform is a systematic and fierce struggle" and "Many landlords may still resolutely oppose and sabotage land reform, and may still resolutely oppose and sabotage the People's Government. Those resolutely reactionary elements should be resolutely punished, and should not be tolerated or indulged." Secondly, in order to carry out this serious struggle, the first thing that must be talked about is how to mobilize the masses, how to let the masses grasp the law, how to let the masses rise up to struggle, and suppress the sabotage of landlords. Comrade Ren Bishi pointed out in "Several Issues in Land Reform": "To implement land reform, it requires very meticulous and very artistic leadership. Only by truly mobilizing the masses can the feudal class be eliminated." Without this step, any legal provisions cannot be implemented. However, these publications also pay insufficient attention or even no attention to this point. Although the book "How to Carry Out Land Reform" is more complete than other books, it has not focused on these issues. Experience has proven that thinking that as long as policies and laws are announced, landlords will abide by the law and land reform can be carried out smoothly is a harmful and one-sided way of grasping policies.
    Among these publications, some are compiled from articles on the experiences of intellectuals participating in land reform, such as "Experiences and Insights on Land Reform" published by Practical Publishing House, which mainly compiles articles by people in Beijing's cultural and educational circles summarizing their ideological gains from participating in land reform in the suburbs of Beijing. If these are not regarded as experiences in land reform work, but as experiences of ideological transformation of intellectuals in land reform, it is certainly not useless. In this case, it is not appropriate to exaggerate the title of the book as "Experiences on Land Reform." It is also necessary to make the title of the book appropriately reflect the effects that the content can achieve. At the same time, the editor must be responsible for explaining certain necessary places. For example, land reform in the suburbs of Beijing is based on the old policy towards rich peasants. These should be explained to the reader. The editorial style of cutting and pasting into a book without thinking should be opposed.
    In all publications on land reform, there has not yet appeared a book that makes a specialized academic study of land issues. Such books are very necessary. In the past, we have had some achievements in this area, but they are far from meeting the needs of reality. This should be one of the goals that the entire publishing industry and writing circles should strive for today. For example, it is extremely necessary to systematically study, compile, and publish about the history of agricultural economics, about the rent reduction and interest reduction policies implemented in the liberated areas during the Anti-Japanese War, and about the socio-economic changes that have occurred in the areas that have already implemented land reform during the People's Revolutionary War. As for books that correctly explain the historical process of land reform and summarize experience, they are certainly also extremely necessary. This work is very vast. We still hope to see complete and profound works, but if there can be one or two valuable gains in a certain aspect, or a popular and complete narrative of the theory of land issues, even if many unavoidable questionable points may occur, they can be forgiven.
    Works on the actual situation of rural economic investigation and research are also very necessary. There have been some scattered achievements in this in the past. Due to the various political and economic oppressions in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the busy practical battles in the liberated areas, these achievements have lagged far behind the needs of reality. Today, we should be fully capable of promoting this work in all aspects. Among this batch of books we have seen, there are four books published by Northeast Xinhua Bookstore: "Research on Landlords and Rich Peasants in the Northeast," published by Central South Xinhua Bookstore: "Investigation of Rural Conditions in Central South Provinces," and published by East China Xinhua Bookstore: "New Scenery in Rural Areas After Land Reform" and "The Road to Production and Prosperity." There are also some other pamphlets that have been compiled into some rural investigation materials published in newspapers. These things are very much needed.
    In general, we hope that when compiling popular policy readings, they should be strictly based on the spirit and system of the policy and comprehensively narrate it, and in particular, should avoid rashly participating in personal opinions. We do need the publishing industry to contribute their strength, and to carry out prudent compilation and publication work related to land reform and rural economic issues within their ability, in order to meet the needs of the country and the people. We believe that as long as we work hard, we will make achievements. For example, the book published by Shanghai Popular Culture Publishing House mentioned above has certain advantages and can satisfy readers to a considerable extent. As for the publishing style that is entirely focused on making profits, it must be opposed and has no future.

    关于土地改革的出版物
    长风
    为了迎接土地改革运动，上海出版了不少关于土地改革的书籍；出版界能够配合这个伟大的革命历史任务来进行出版工作，当然是可以称许的。但正由于问题重大，影响深远，我们就必须十分慎重地进行这一工作。早在七月间，上海大公报的“读书与出版”副刊，就批评了这类书籍出版中的不健康倾向，本刊也收到几位读者的来稿，同时也看到几本这类书籍；综合这些看来，在这类出版物中令人满意的还是很少，有部分错误和严重错误的却很多。为了停止一些十分有害的错误意见的影响，并纠正某些出版者在这类出版工作上表现的不健全作风，我们觉得应该予以检讨。政策读物本来应该慎重从事的，土地改革运动的关系极为重大，编著出版更不能不万分审慎，但我们看到的许多出版物却表现了一种极端轻率、不负责任的现象。
    上海实用出版社出版、叶明华编著的“土地改革法学习问答”，就是这样一本典型的草率出版物。这本书是在七月出版的，它自然不能根据中央人民政府政务院八月四日颁布的“关于划分农村阶级成份的决定”这个文件来进行编写，但它是根据了六月二十八日中央人民政府委员会通过的“中华人民共和国土地改革法”这个文件编写的。这个土地改革法已明确规定“农村社会阶级成份的合法定义，另定之”，编著者在本书第五十八页也提出过：“中共中央关于一九三三年两个文件的决定”中划分析阶级的方法“是不甚适用了”，那么，读者就有理由要求不应该根据自知已经不甚适用的旧文件来编写今天的土地改革的读物。但实际上，本书仍然是根据旧的划阶级文件来编写的，因此，就发生了许多本来可以避免的错误。甚至在土地改革法这个文件中业已明确规定的字句，本书也有擅加删削的，例如对于半地主式富农的定义，土地改革法第六条规定的是：“出租大量土地超过其自耕和雇人耕耘的土地数量者”，本书则无“大量”二字。
    由于缺少对法令的全面的掌握，也发生了些错误，例如在“那些土地应被没收和征收”一个问答中，漏了也是说土地的没收和征收的第六条中所规定的一项，即富农所有之出租的小量土地，经省以上人民政府批准得征收其一部或全部的条文。这样自然不能给读者以对这个问题的完整的了解。这一条文是被编进“半地主式的富农出租的大量土地是否保留”这一问题中去了，这是不妥当的，因为出租小量土地的富农并非半地主式的富农。
    事实上，在这本书里，大大小小的错误是多至不可胜数的。例如它根据刘副主席的报告说明农村土地占有关系，按原报告是说占农村人口百分之九十的贫农、雇农、中农及其他人民只占有百分之二十到三十的土地，在这里却错成“一般的说来，占人口百分之八十的贫农、雇农、中农……”。这可能是校勘错误，但在另一处地方，又说“地主富农在华北东北各地，户数占百分之十六”，“而贫农户数占八成多”，这个数字是很不可靠的，不可以把个别调查的数字说成“华北东北各地”的一般数字，而且它显然和前面的数字相矛盾，这样，究竟叫读者相信哪个数字好呢？说地主、富农占农户的百分之十六，贫农占八成多，中农和雇农又到那里去了呢？引述许多互相冲突的数字而不加以起码的检查，是造成这本书许多错误的原因之一。又如说“每公顷土地的产米量，美国为二二·七公斤，日本为三五·九公斤，而中国仅有十八·九公斤”，按每公顷约等于十五市亩，这样，中国每一市亩的产米量就只有一公斤半不到了，这是不合常识的。更错误的是说在土改以后，农民的粮食“除去一部分以赋税的形式，缴予国家之外，农民手中至少还可保留百分之三十至六十”，这样，国家从农民手中取去的赋税竟达到农民收入的百分之四十到七十了，这完全是不合事实的。又如中国共产党于一九四七年十月曾召开全国土地会议，这本书则错成了一九四八年。
    大公报“读书与出版”的一位作者，已经正确指出过：“土地改革是一个复杂艰巨的问题，从纵的方面说，过去土地革命时代以至于一九四七年所公布的土地法大纲都不能适用于今日；从横的方面说，甲地的办法不适宜于乙地，丙地的办法也不适宜于丁地。”而许多书籍轻率地将个别经验说成普遍规律，更不注明引用出处，这种主观主义对实际工作是有极大害处的。“土地改革学习问答”也就犯了许多这样的错误。例如在“分配果实要采取什么步骤”这个问答中说：“让地富列单自报土地财产，然后清查登记，暂交地主自己本人保管”。不用说，这种具体步骤在不同地方是可以完全不相同的，编著者是已经知道今天的政策是保存富农，但仍然含糊地把地富并称，这证明编辑工作十分草率，未经过基本思考。而且这个经验本身也是极可怀疑的，它丝毫没有讲到在斗争中的农民应该对这种地主自报采取什么正确的态度，难道能够片面地相信地主自报的忠实性吗？又居然能够把斗争果实交托给斗争对象保管吗？
    正风出版社出版、李洛漠编著“土地改革法基本读本”中“为什么要团结中农”一节，歪曲地引述毛主席的话：“全部中农都可以成为无产阶级可靠的同盟者，是现阶段中国革命很好的革命动力之一。”这话出自“中国革命与中国共产党”，然而实际上毛主席是这样讲的：“全部中农都可以成为无产阶级可靠的同盟者，中农是很好的革命动力之一。”原文和引文显然是有相当大的区别的。引用经典性的文字必须有基本的责任心，不容许擅自增删，这是应该再一次向出版者和著作者提起注意的。
    “土地改革法基本读本”是一本很粗糙的书，正文不过一万多点字，却用了六千多字在中国革命性质问题上重复叙述，真正谈到土地改革法的不上五千字。它甚至把对外贸易的一些统计也零零碎碎地凑了进去。书后另加几页“名词浅释”，大多与土地改革问题无关。这样一本很少真正谈到土地改革法的书，如何能叫它是“土地改革法基本读本”呢？这显然是一种作动机不够纯正的不良作风。书中有很多地方显得著者缺少足够的经济知识，例如说“现在中国有五千万纱锭，那末每天都需要农业供给它四千三百万斤棉花”，实际上，中国现有纱锭还不到一千万锭。又说：“如果农村棉花的数量超过工业需要的几倍，不是工业生产可以大量地提高和发展了吗？”这种议论即使不用马列主义经济学的观点看，也是不合理的，因为工业以外的用棉一般有其限度，原棉生产超过工业需要“好几倍”，这无疑会发生生产过剩，不利于农业也不利于工业的。一个著作者对于所处理的问题，应该下一番起码的钻研工夫，才能够对读者有点好处，这要求是不过高的，而也是克服目前出版界某些混乱状态所必要。
    焦世雄先生从陕西宝鸡来信批评上海文工书店出版、冯森编著的“中华人民共和国土地改革法学习问答”，对富农和雇农定义的错误。来信说，这本书在西北销行很广，单就宝鸡一地，约有数百本之多。它称富农是“自有较多土地，自行经营耕种的农民。他们不受地主剥削，或租佃少数，但受地主剥削较少，因此生活较中农为优裕”，这确是原则性的错误，富农在这里似乎变成独立劳动的农民或甚至被剥削者了。固然，我们应该实行保存富农的政策，这是有利于社会经济的发展的。但富农仍然是一种资本主义的剥削者，因而不能单单称为自行经营耕种的农民，中国的富农又常带有半封建性，具有某些封建的剥削关系，这也是不能忽视的。含糊了富农的阶级定义，就不能使读者了解整个土地改革政策的精神。这其实在所有划阶级的文件中都有明白的规定的。书中对雇农的定义是：“自己没有土地和劳动工具而帮地主或富农耕种的雇佣劳动者”，这也确没有明白说出雇农被剥削的阶级本质。又据上海大公报“读书与出版”的批评，这本书还有其他错误，例如说“中农占农民阶级总数百分之八十”。这些错误其实都是容易发现的，而且有成文可查，我们觉得如果是一个负责的编著者，是完全可以避免的。
    刘志城先生写了一篇文章介绍上海通俗文化出版社出版、周农编写的“怎样进行土地改革”一书，我们看过原书之后，觉得的确是和其他的小册子有所不同，文字很通俗，编写态度是负责的。它基本上是按照土地法顺序编写，避免了割裂毛病，因而保持了大体的完整。但因为土地改革政策是一个极难处理的题材，因此仍然有个别重要的错误。例如作者解释“征收”和“没收”的不同，认为“没收”带强迫性质，而“征收”是“采取说服动员的方法，征求被征收者的同意，自觉自愿的把土地拿出来。”这种说法是错误的和毫无根据的。土地改革法乃是国家颁布的法令，不论征收和没收，都必然带有强制性质；国家依法征收土地（或者是有偿征收，或者是无偿征收，这里是无偿征收），绝不必要去取得被征收者的同意，被征收者当然也绝无理由可以拒绝征收。没收和征收的不同是在于：没收是对革命的敌人所采取的革命的手段，而征收则是人民为了整个国家和人民的利益而负担的一种法律义务。这本来是一种国家法权的惯例，在东南欧许多新民主主义国家宪法中都有这种规定，例如阿尔巴尼亚宪法，就有这样的规定：“如为社会利益所需要，私有财产得被限制与征用，但须根据特别法律规定行之。”
    如果我们要求更高一点，那么，在所有出版物中，讲到政策和法令的种种限制时，对于刘副主席的报告中所讲的“土地改革是一场系统的激烈的斗争。”和“地主中的许多人还是可能要坚决反对与破坏土地改革的，还是可能要坚决反对与破坏人民政府的。对于这些坚决的反动的分子，就应该坚决地加以惩办，而不应该宽容和放纵”，都显得注意不足或甚至完全不注意。其次，为了进行这种严重的斗争，首先必须讲的是应该如何发动群众，如何让群众掌握法律，如何让群众起来斗争，镇压地主的破坏。任弼时同志在“土地改革中的几个问题”一文中就指出过：“要贯彻土地改革，是需要很细致的很艺术的领导，要真正把群众发动起来才能把封建阶级消灭。”不经过这一步，任何法律条文都是贯彻不下去的。但对于这一点，这些出版物也是注意不足或甚至不注意的。“怎样进行土地改革”这本书虽然比别的书完整些，也还没有着重地谈到这些问题。经验证明：以为只要宣布政策和法令，就能使地主守法，就能顺利进行土地改革，乃是一种有害的片面的掌握政策的方法。
    在这些出版物中，有的是编辑一些知识分子参加土改的经验的文章而成的，如实用出版社出版的“土改的经验与心得”，就主要是编辑一些北京文教界人士总结参加北京郊区土改的思想收获的文章而成。如果这些并不是当作土改工作的经验，而是当作知识分子在土地改革中的思想改造的经验，当然也不是没有用处的；如此，就不宜把书名夸大地称为“土改的经验”。使书名恰当地表现内容所能达到的效果，也是必要的。同时，编辑者必须负责对某些必需解释的地方作解释，例如北京郊区土改是依据旧的对富农政策的，这些，自应负责向读者说明。剪贴成书，不加思考的编辑作风是应该反对的。
    在所有关于土地改革的出版物中，还没有出现一本对土地问题作专门学理研究的书籍，这样的书籍正是十分必要的。过去我们在这方面曾经有过一些成绩，但还远不能满足现实的需要。这应该是今天整个出版界、著作界应努力的目标之一。例如，关于农业经济史，关于解放区在抗日战争中所实行的减租减息政策和在人民革命战争中已经实行了土地改革的地区所发生的社会经济的变化，是极需要加以系统的研究、编写和出版的；至于正确地说明土改的历史进程和总结经验的书，当然也极为需要。这一工作是十分浩大的，我们仍然希望看到完整深刻的著作，但如果能对某一方面有一二珍贵收获，或能通俗完整的叙述一下土地问题的理论，即使会发生许多不易避免的值得商榷的地方，也是可以原谅的。
    关于农村经济实际情况调查研究的著作，也是十分必要的。这在过去也有过一些零碎的成绩。由于在国民党反动派统治区的工作受着种种政治的和经济的压迫，在解放区又忙于实际的战斗，因而这些成绩远落后于现实的需要。在今天应该完全有条件来从各方面推进这一工作了。在我们看到的这批书籍中，有东北新华书店出版的“东北地主富农研究”，中南新华书店出版的“中南各省农村情况调查”，华东新华书店出版的“土改后农村新景象”、“生产致富的道路”四本书。也有其他一些小册子，编入了一些报上登过的农村调查材料。这些东西是很合需要的。
    总的说来，我们希望在编写通俗的政策读物时，应该严格按照政策的精神和系统来全面地叙述，尤应避免轻率地参加个人意见。我们的确需要出版界贡献出他们的力量，在他们能力所及的范围内进行慎重的、有关土地改革和农村经济问题的编著出版工作，以适应国家和人民的需要。我们相信，只要认真工作，是会做出成绩来的，例如上面指出的上海通俗文化出版社的书，便有其一定的优点，能在相当程度上满足读者。至于完全以牟利为能事的出版作风，那是必须反对的，也是没有前途的。
