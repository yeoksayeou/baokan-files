Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th: Helen Ferris, an American professor at the private Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Nanjing (note: this college is a Christian school), has openly distorted facts to slander the Chinese people and Chinese students, and has ignored the protests raised by the student union. The college held a denunciation meeting on December 2nd and put forward four demands. The matter unfolded as follows:

On November 13th, when American professor Helen Ferris was correcting student Li Yunben's English sentence construction, she unreasonably changed "American troops advancing into Korea" to "United Nations troops advancing into Korea." Li Yunben wrote a letter to the school's student union on the 14th to report Ferris's action. On the 17th, student Li Zhenkun also wrote to the student union, accusing Ferris of openly promoting reactionary ideas while teaching the "Social Systems" course. The letter pointed out: Ferris publicly praised fascist leaders Hitler and Chiang Kai-shek, who slaughtered hundreds of millions of people; and wantonly slandered Stalin, the leader of the world's working people, and Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people. When Ferris talked about the American education system, she even referred to the American imperialism's oppression of black people, the dismissal of democratic professors, the suppression of workers, and the control of schools by American soldiers and financial tycoons' agents, implementing militaristic education, as "democracy" and "freedom," and maliciously slandered the New Democratic education of China. Ferris, in her lectures, actually defended imperialist aggression and war policies, saying: "Although war destroys some property and injures or kills some people, war can promote scientific invention and cultural exchange."

After the student union executive committee of the college published the above-mentioned letters of accusation, the students expressed their anger at Ferris's counter-revolutionary and imperialist remarks. Discussions were held at all levels and in all departments, and it was unanimously demanded that Ferris admit that this was an act of distorting facts and slandering the Chinese people. Ferris openly resisted and said: "I changed the American army to the United Nations army because 'my' position is different from the position of the Chinese people." Ferris's response fully demonstrated that she firmly stood on the side of American imperialism.

The college's student union repeatedly sent representatives to Ferris's residence on the 30th to request her to answer the questions raised by the students. Ferris refused to read the letter, refused to answer, and her attitude was extremely rude.

The students and professors of the college held a denunciation meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd. In addition to the entire faculty, staff, and students of the college, representatives from private Huiwen, Hongguang, Mingde, Zhonghua Girls' High School, Ginling University, Public Pharmaceutical College, No. 2 Girls' High School, and teachers and students from National Nanjing University, totaling more than 1,500 people, participated in this denunciation meeting. The female teachers and students of the college vied to speak. Student Li Jinhua said: Under the influence of Ferris's war-mongering propaganda, her thinking had been poisoned. After the outbreak of the Korean War, she still believed Ferris's fallacy that war could promote the advancement of science and culture. It was not until she participated in current affairs studies that she clarified the nature of imperialist aggression. Professor Pan Dingyu of the history department of the college said: Peace-loving people oppose the making of war, but Ferris praises war. What else does this illustrate except that she is an enemy of mankind? I object to such a person being a professor. Professor Chen Heqin of the Nanjing University Teachers College and Professor Zhao Ruixia of the Foreign Languages Department both agreed with this view. Christian professors Zhang Yanlan and student Xu Bingqing said that a pure Christian should love mankind. But Ferris openly encourages war, which proves that she has lost the religious conscience that a believer should have. Professor Liu Kairong of the Literature Department said: We must have a high degree of national self-esteem to safeguard the dignity of our motherland and not allow imperialist elements to occupy our schools and carry out reactionary and defamatory propaganda.

Finally, all the faculty, staff, and students unanimously passed the following four demands: 1. Demand that Ferris frankly state her reactionary behavior in China over the past 20 years and admit that she is an imperialist element. 2. Demand that Ferris publish an apology in the newspaper to the entire faculty, staff, and students of Ginling Women's College and the entire Chinese people. 3. Publish a letter to the students, requesting the Student Federation to convene a city-wide student representative meeting to reveal the truth of the matter. 4. Demand that the government deport Ferris from the country.

    金陵女子文理学院美籍教授费睿思
    恶意诽谤中国人民
    该校师生员工举行控诉，要求政府将其驱逐出境。
    【新华社南京四日电】南京私立金陵女子文理学院（按该校系一基督教会学校）美籍教授费睿思（Helen Ferris）公然歪曲事实诽谤中国人民与中国学生，并对学生会所提出的抗议置之不理。该校为此于十二月二日召开控诉大会，并提出四项要求。此事经过如下：
    十一月十三日该校美籍教授费睿思在修改学生李芸本的英文造句时，无理地把“美国进兵朝鲜”改成了“联合国进兵朝鲜”。李芸本把费的这种举动于十四日写信报告该校学生会。十七日该校学生李振坤亦致书学生会控诉费睿思在教授“社会制度”课时公然宣传反动的思想。该信指出：费曾公然歌颂屠杀亿万人民的法西斯头子希特勒与蒋介石；并肆意诽谤世界劳动人民领袖斯大林与中国人民领袖毛泽东。当费讲到美国教育制度时，竟将美帝国主义压迫黑人、解聘民主教授、镇压工人群众、美国军人及财阀代理人控制学校，实行军国主义教育等称为“民主”与“自由”，并恶意诽谤新民主主义的中国教育。费睿思在讲课时竟然为帝国主义的侵略和战争政策辩护，她说：“战争虽然是摧毁一些财产，死伤一些人，不过战争却能推进科学的发明及文化的交流。”
    该校学生会执行委员会将上述控诉信公布后，学生们对费睿思的反革命的帝国主义的言论均表愤怒。各级各科都进行了讨论，一致提出要费承认这是一种歪曲事实与诽谤中国人民的行为。费竟公然抗拒，并称：“我把美国军队改为联合国军队，乃是因为‘我’的立场与中国人民立场不同。”费的这种答复完全证明了她是坚决地站在美国帝国主义的立场上的。
    该校学生会曾于三十日一再派代表去费宅要求她答复同学们提出的质问。费拒绝看信，拒绝答复，态度极为横蛮。
    该校学生和教授乃于二日下午举行控诉大会。参加这一控诉大会的，除去该校全体师生员工外尚有私立汇文、弘光、明德、中华女中、金陵大学、公立药专、二女中等校代表及国立南京大学师生，共计一千五百余人。女大师生纷纷争着发言。学生李锦华说：在费鼓动战争的宣传影响下，她的思想曾蒙受过毒害。在朝鲜战争爆发后，她还相信费的所谓战争是可以促进科学文化前进的谬论。直到进行时事学习时才弄清帝国主义发动侵略战争的本质。该校历史系教授潘定宇说：爱好和平的人类是反对制造战争的，但是费却歌颂战争。这除了说明她是人类的公敌外，还说明什么？我反对这样的人作教授。南大师范学院陈鹤琴教授、外文系赵瑞霟教授都表示同意这个意见。基督教徒教授张雁兰和学生许冰清都说，一个纯正的基督教徒应该是热爱人类的。但费却公开鼓动战争，这证明她已失去一个教徒应有的宗教良心。文学系的教授刘开荣说：我们必须要有高度的民族自尊来维护祖国的尊严，不让帝国主义分子盘踞在我们的学校里进行反动的诽谤性的宣传。
    最后全体师生员工一致通过提出以下四点要求：一、要求费坦白地说出她在华二十年来的反动行为，承认她是帝国主义分子。二、要求费登报向金陵女子大学全体师生员工及全中国人民道歉。三、发表告同学书，要求学联召开全市学生代表会议，揭露事情真相。四、要求政府驱逐费睿思出境。
