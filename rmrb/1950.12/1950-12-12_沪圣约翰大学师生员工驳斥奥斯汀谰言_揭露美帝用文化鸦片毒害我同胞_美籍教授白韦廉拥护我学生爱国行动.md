Shanghai St. John's University Faculty, Staff, and Students Refute Austin's Absurd Remarks, Exposing American Imperialism's Use of Cultural Opium to Poison Our Compatriots; American Professor William C. Berges Supports Students' Patriotic Actions

[This newspaper reports] According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily, the preparatory committee of the St. John's University Resist-America, Aid-Korea, Defend-the-Homeland Committee issued a "Patriotic Declaration by Faculty, Staff, and Students of St. John's University" on December 5th, denouncing Austin's shameless lies. The declaration stated:

Austin portrays St. John's University as one of American imperialism's "favors" to China, boasting that a large number of Chinese youth have been "educated" and received "university degrees" here for many years; but Austin deliberately fails to mention that St. John's University has never been a Chinese university in the past, but rather an American school, an American cultural concession, and an American business-run education factory located on Chinese territory. Its teaching work was only responsible to American factory owners, and only served to manufacture their tools of aggression. Its relationship with China only勉强 (mianqiang) established a bit of legal footing after completing the registration procedures in 1947. In this special cultural concession, the system and curriculum were very peculiar; the words and will of Americans were the law, the official common language was foreign, and the main course of the history department was Western history. Chinese history, however, used foreign-written English textbooks, and reading English textbooks of world geography might enable one to say how many states there are in the United States, but not how many provinces there are in China. The negation of Chinese language, history, culture, art, and way of life, and the destruction of the national consciousness of Chinese youth, was the highest principle of this cultural concession. Therefore, it once produced salesmen for American goods, worshipers of the American moon, and "educated" Song Ziwen, one of the pillars of the four major families, and Gu Weijun, a diligent running dog of Wall Street, etc., and used these tools to carry out cultural, political, and economic aggression against China, to serve American interests. This is the purpose of American imperialism in running schools in China! We would like to ask Austin, whose "friendship" is this exactly?

However, history is completely contrary to the will of the invaders. The United States opened up cultural concessions in China and promoted cultural opium, but it did not paralyze the national consciousness of Chinese sons and daughters. On the contrary, it awakened the "non-American" young men and women of St. John's University to resolutely engage in the anti-American imperialist struggle. The existence and significance of St. John's University do not follow the will of the invaders. In 1919, under the pressure of the rulers of the American cultural concession, the youth of St. John's University resolutely held a conference and used action to protest against the Japanese imperialists and their accomplices for the serious destruction of Chinese sovereignty by the "Twenty-One Demands." In 1925, under greater pressure, enduring the loss of schooling and persecution, they used more resolute actions to protest against a group of imperialists' bloody massacre of the Chinese people in the "May 30th" massacre. In 1948, they actively participated in the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement of Shanghai youth, causing the then American consul in Shanghai and the head of the American Information Office to personally come to St. John's University to conduct "investigations" of "un-American activities" in a flustered manner, saying again and again that "anti-American activities in schools supported by American economy will never be tolerated." However, whether they tolerate it or not, we want to tell Austin that St. John's University has deeply experienced a truth from its past history, that is, for St. John's University to survive and develop more meaningfully in the future, it must resolutely stand on the position of patriotism and resolutely struggle against the aggressive behavior of American imperialism, and stand on the side of the people and the side of the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th -- William C. Berges, an American professor at St. John's University in Shanghai, spoke at an anti-American patriotic rally held at the school on the 7th, denouncing Austin's shameless lies and supporting the patriotic actions of Chinese students.

He said: "Standing on the position of the American people, I fully support your protest against Austin, and I also support the accusations of the students of Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences. We want to protest against Austin's lie that running missionary schools in China is an expression of America's 'friendship' to China."

Bai Weilian said: "Austin is a running dog of American monopoly capitalists, and these capitalists are the ruling group that launched the Korean war of aggression. Before liberation, it was this group that used missionary schools in China as one of the important tools for their attempt to rule the Chinese people. The educational purpose of missionary schools is to educate Chinese students to become anti-motherland, anti-people, and yearn for the so-called 'American culture.' The most representative of this so-called 'American culture' is low-level, erotic, and poisonous Hollywood movies."

Bai Weilian emphatically stated: "Now many Chinese youths have realized that they have received poisonous ideas and have established new viewpoints."

    沪圣约翰大学师生员工驳斥奥斯汀谰言
    揭露美帝用文化鸦片毒害我同胞
    美籍教授白韦廉拥护我学生爱国行动
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报消息：圣约翰大学抗美援朝保家卫国委员会筹备会于十二月五日发表“圣约翰大学师生员工爱国宣言”，痛斥奥斯汀无耻谰言。宣言略称：
    奥斯汀把圣约翰大学，作为美帝对华的“恩典”之一，吹嘘有大批中国青年许多年来曾在这儿受过“教育”，领受过“大学学位”；但奥斯汀故意不提，约大在过去一向不是中国的大学，而是设在中国领土上的美国学校，美国文化租界，美商教育工厂。它的教学工作，只对美国厂主负责，只是为着制造它的侵略工具而已。它和中国的关系，那是等到一九四七年办理了立案手续后才勉强成立一点法律的关系。在这个特殊的文化租界中，制度和课程都是很奇特的，美国人的言辞和意志就是法律，官方的通用语文是洋文，教授西洋史是历史学系的主要课程。中国史却采用外国人写的英文本，读英文本的世界地理也许能够说出美国有多少州，而说不出中国有多少省。对于中国语文、历史、文化、艺术和生活方式的否定，与摧毁中国青年的民族意识，就是这个文化租界的最高原则。因此，它曾经制造出美国商品的推销员，美国月亮的崇拜者，又“教育”出四大家族台柱之一的宋子文，和华尔街殷勤走卒顾维钧等，并经过这些工具来实行对中国的文化政治经济侵略，来为美国利益服务。这就是美帝在中国办学校的目的！我们倒要问奥斯汀这到底是对谁的“友谊”？
    然而历史却和侵略者的意志完全相反的。美国在华开辟了文化租界，推销文化鸦片，也不曾麻痹了中华儿女的民族意识，反而唤醒了约大“非美”的青年男女坚决从事反美帝斗争。约大的存在和意义，却不是按照着侵略者的意志的。一九一九年在美国文化租界统治者的压力之下，约大青年坚决地举行了大会，用行动向日本帝国主义者及其帮凶抗议“廿一条”对于中国主权严重的破坏。一九二五年在更大的压力之下，忍受着失学和迫害，用更坚决的行动，抗议一群帝国主义者在“五卅”惨案中对于中国人民血腥的屠杀。一九四八年积极参加了上海青年的反美扶日运动，弄得当时的上海美国领事和美国新闻处处长手忙脚乱地亲自到约大来作“非美活动”的“调查”，口口声声说“决不容忍美国经济支持的学校出现了反美活动”。然而容忍也罢，不容忍也罢，我们要告诉奥斯汀的，就是圣约翰大学，从它过去历史中已经深切地体验出一条真理，就是约大今后为了更有意义的生存和发展，必须坚决的站在爱国主义的立场，对于美帝的侵略行为进行坚决的斗争，而站在人民的一边，革命的一边。
    【新华社上海十日电】上海圣约翰大学美籍教授白韦廉（William C.Berges）七日在该校举行的反美爱国大会上发言痛斥奥斯汀的无耻谎言，拥护中国学生的爱国行动。
    他说：“我站在美国人民的立场，全力支持你们对奥斯汀的抗议，也支持金陵女子文理学院同学的控诉。我们要抗议奥斯汀所谓在中国办教会学校是表示美国对中国的‘友谊’的谎言。”
    白韦廉说：“奥斯汀是美国独占资本家的走狗，这些资本家们就是发动朝鲜侵略战争的统治集团。在解放前，也正是这个集团利用在中国的教会学校，作为他们企图统治中国人民的重要工具之一。教会学校的教育目的是想把中国学生教育成为反祖国、反人民，而向往所谓‘美国文化’。这所谓‘美国文化’中最富代表性的就是低级趣味的、色情的、有毒素的好莱坞电影。”
    白韦廉力称：“现在许多中国青年已觉悟到他们所受到的是有毒的思想，并且已建立了新的观点。”
