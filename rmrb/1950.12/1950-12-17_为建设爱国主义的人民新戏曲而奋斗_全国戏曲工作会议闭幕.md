    Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: The National Opera Work Conference, which opened on November 27th, concluded on December 11th. After group discussions on the report "Strive for Patriotic People's Opera" by Tian Han, Director of the Opera Reform Bureau, and the reports on script review and artist unity education by Deputy Directors Yang Shaoxuan and Ma Yanxiang, all the representatives at the conference reached a consensus on the direction of opera reform.

    The discussions at the conference indicated that the opera reform work in various parts of the country has made great achievements in the past year or so. These achievements are: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, the vast number of artists have permanently broken away from the status of being despised and humiliated in the old society, and have been valued by the people and the country. 30,000 artists participated in learning. More than 200 newly compiled and rewritten operas were staged in various places and were welcomed by the broad masses. The vast number of artists in various places, as masters of their own affairs, actively participated in various social and political activities.

    The representatives at the conference unanimously agreed in their speeches that opera is a powerful tool for educating the people with revolutionary spirit and patriotism, and artists bear a major responsibility in the cause of educating the people. The representatives believed that opera must promote a new patriotic spirit and encourage heroism in revolutionary wars and productive labor. Therefore, all operas that are helpful to resisting aggression, resisting oppression, fighting for freedom, and defending justice should be rewarded and promoted, while operas that promote feudal slave morality, promote barbarism and terror, and insult the working people should be opposed. The conference decided that local cultural and educational organs should be responsible for reviewing the opera programs staged and adopt a positive reform policy for the existing operas, but should not ban performances without authorization. If a small number of old operas that are seriously harmful to the people need to be banned, it must be reported to the Central Ministry of Culture for handling. The conference decided that the current opera reform work should focus on making necessary and appropriate modifications to certain undesirable content of the existing operas. According to the decision of the conference, the modifications will focus on reactionary political content that has a real impact. In terms of artistic form, the conference decided to first remove those barbaric, backward, servile, and terrifying images from the stage, such as bound feet, snot, and torture, because this kind of performance is insulting to one's own nation and violates patriotism. The conference believed that historical dramas should focus on expressing historical truth and praising the creation and struggle of the true masters of history—the working people. The distorted parts of history in the old operas should be corrected, but historical figures should be evaluated according to the historical conditions at the time. It is neither appropriate to force the ancients to have the thoughts of modern people and do the things of modern people, nor should historical events be inappropriately compared with today's revolutionary struggles. The representatives pointed out in the discussion that historical and legendary heroes loved by the people should be affirmed, focusing on praising the Chinese people's tradition of bravery and hard work, in order to educate and encourage the modern people and enhance their national self-esteem and self-confidence. The representatives also pointed out that folk opera contains a part of excellent mythological dramas, such as Journey to the West, Legend of the White Snake, etc. These mythological dramas use rich imagination and beautiful images to express the struggles of the world and should be cherished. The conference decided that when dealing with the existing operas, a careful distinction should be made between mythology and superstition, love and licentiousness.

    The conference believed that in addition to extensively modifying and adapting historical dramas with educational significance and scripts with legendary themes, scripts that express the struggle life of modern people should be created in appropriate opera forms. At the same time, more short and concise scripts should be written so that they can be spread and performed in local opera troupes.

    Regarding the issue of opera genres, the conference believed that Chinese opera has extremely rich and diverse types, and a universal, systematic, in-depth excavation, re-election, and development should be carried out to promote the "blooming of a hundred flowers" of various opera arts. The conference especially emphasized the importance of reforming local operas, because local operas, especially folk minor operas, are closer to folk life, and the forms are more free, which is convenient for expressing the life and struggle of modern people. The representatives pointed out in the discussion that in recent years, the rapid development of local operas and folk minor operas, such as Yue Opera, Ping Opera, and Chu Opera, has become a common trend throughout the country. Therefore, the conference determined that the opera reform work in various places should focus on the opera genres that have the greatest impact on the local masses as the main reform objects, and should widely collect, record, and publish the new and old scripts of local operas and folk operas for research and improvement. The conference decided to hold a national opera competition and performance once a year to exhibit the achievements of various opera genres, reward their excellent works and performances, and guide their development. The conference also pointed out that Chinese Quyi forms are simple and rich in changes, which is very convenient for reflecting reality. In the future, in addition to creating a large number of new lyrics, many historical stories and beautiful folk legends familiar to the people should also be transformed and adopted.

    The conference discussed the reform of the old system, believing that it is one of the important prerequisites for improving Chinese opera. The conference believed that the old apprenticeship system, adopted daughter system, and Jinglike system, which infringe upon human rights and the welfare of artists, should be reformed step by step and in a planned manner, but it should be done through the artists' conscious and voluntary participation, and should not be rushed.

    The conference decided that in the future, the competent cultural and educational authorities in various places should unify and strengthen the leadership of the opera reform work, earnestly conduct artist education to improve their political, cultural, and professional level, so that the old opera becomes "new opera," the old artists become "new artists," so that the names of "old opera" and "old artists" become the past, and the entire opera circle becomes a huge force in the new literary and art undertakings.

    The representatives who spoke at the conference all pledged to implement the spirit of the conference in all parts of the country under the leadership of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, and strive to build a new patriotic people's opera.

    During the conference, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, Vice Chairmen Shen Yanbing and Chen Boda of the Cultural and Educational Committee, and Vice Minister Zhou Yang of the Ministry of Culture all gave speeches to the conference, giving the representatives great encouragement. The conference held an exhibition of opera cultural relics and literature and an opera performance evening. Famous artist representatives held three days of charity performances, using all the ticket revenue to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting against the United States and aiding Korea.

    After the conclusion of the conference, all the representatives participated in the grand demonstration parade initiated by themselves in the capital's literary and art circles for ten days to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang, and the mood was extremely enthusiastic.

    为建设爱国主义的人民新戏曲而奋斗            
    全国戏曲工作会议闭幕
    【新华社十五日讯】十一月二十七日召开的全国戏曲工作会议，已在十二月十一日闭幕。会议的全体代表们在就戏曲改进局田汉局长“为爱国主义的人民戏曲而奋斗”的报告及杨绍萱马彦祥副局长关于剧本编审及艺人团结教育的报告进行分组讨论后，对于戏曲改革的方针已得到一致的意见。
    会议的讨论表示出全国各地的戏曲改革工作在一年多以来已有很大的成绩。这些成绩是：在中国共产党和人民政府的领导之下，广大的艺人永远脱离了过去在旧社会中所处的被贱视、被侮辱的地位，而受到人民与国家的重视。三万艺人参加了学习。各地上演了二百种以上新编和改写的戏曲，获得了广大群众的欢迎。各地广大的艺人，以主人翁的身份，积极参加了各种社会的政治活动。
    会议的代表们在发言中一致认为：戏曲是以革命精神和爱国主义教育人民的强有力的工具，艺人在教育人民的事业上负有重大的责任。代表们认为：戏曲必须发扬新的爱国主义精神，鼓舞革命战争和生产劳动中的英雄主义，因此，应当对一切有助于反抗侵略，反抗压迫，争取自由，保卫正义的戏曲予以奖励、推广，而反对宣传封建奴隶道德，宣传野蛮、恐怖行为，侮辱劳动人民的戏曲。会议决定：各地文教机关应负责对上演戏曲节目加以审查，并对旧有戏曲采取积极改革的方针，但不得擅自禁演，如有少数对人民有重要毒害的旧戏曲须予禁演者，必须请示中央文化部处理。会议决定目前戏曲改革工作应以主要力量对旧有戏曲的某些不良内容进行必要的和适当的修改。按照会议的决定，修改将以有现实影响的反动政治内容为主。在艺术形式方面，会议决定首先删除舞台上那些野蛮落后的、奴性的、恐怖的形象、如小脚、鼻涕、酷刑等，因为这种表演是侮辱自己民族的、违反爱国主义的行为。会议认为历史剧应当着重表现历史真实和表扬历史的真正主人——劳动人民的创造和斗争，把旧戏曲中颠倒了、歪曲了历史的部分纠正过来，但是写历史人物应当根据当时历史条件予以估价，既不应强使古人有今人的思想，做今人的事，更不应将历史事迹与今天的革命斗争作不适当的比拟。代表们在讨论中指出，对历史上与传说中为人民所爱戴的英雄人物应予以肯定，着重表扬中国人民英勇、勤劳的传统，借以教育鼓舞现代人民，并增强其民族自尊心和自信心。代表们又指出：民间的戏曲包含一部分优秀的神话剧，如西游记，白蛇传等，这些神话剧以丰富的想像和美丽的形象来表现人间的斗争，应当加以宝贵。会议决定，在对待旧有戏曲时，应当谨慎地区别神话与迷信，恋爱与淫荡。
    会议认为除大量修改与改作有教育意义的历史剧以及传说题材的剧本外，应采取适宜的戏曲形式创作表现现代人民斗争生活的剧本，同时应多写短小精悍的剧本，以便在各地剧团班社流传演出。
    关于剧种的问题，会议认为中国戏曲种类极为丰富多样，应当进行普遍的系统的深入的发掘、改选与发展，以促成多种戏曲艺术的“百花齐放”。会议特别强调了改革地方戏的重要，因为地方戏特别是民间小戏，较接近民间生活，形式亦较自由，便于表现现代人民的生活和斗争。代表们在讨论中指出：最近几年来，地方戏、民间小戏，如越剧、评剧、楚剧等的飞速发展已成为全国普遍的趋势。因此会议确定各地戏曲改革工作应以对于当地群众影响最大的剧种为主要改革对象，并应为此而广泛搜集、记录并刊行地方戏、民间戏的新旧剧本，以供研究改进。会议决定每年举行全国戏曲竞赛公演一次，展览各剧种改进成绩，奖励其优秀作品与演出，指导其发展。会议又指出：中国曲艺形式简单而又富于变化，极便于反映现实，今后除大量创作新词外，对于许多被人民熟悉的历史故事及优美的民间传说唱本亦应加以改造采用。
    会议讨论了旧制度的改革，认为是改进中国戏曲重要前提条件之一。会议认为：对于侵害人权和艺人福利的旧徒弟制度、养女制度、经励科制度等，应有步骤地有计划地加以改革，但要通过艺人的自觉自愿，不可操切从事。
    会议决定今后各地文教主管机关应统一与加强对戏改工作的领导，认真地举办艺人教育，以提高其政治、文化、业务水平，使旧戏曲成为“新戏曲”，旧艺人成为“新艺人”，使“旧戏”“旧艺人”等名称成为过去，使整个戏曲界变成为新文艺事业中的一支巨大力量。
    在会议中发言的代表都提出保证，要在中央人民政府文化部的领导下，把大会精神贯彻到全国各地去，为建设爱国主义的人民新戏曲而奋斗。
    会议期间，政务院周恩来总理、文教委员会沈雁冰、陈伯达两副主任、文化部周扬副部长都曾到会讲演，给代表们以极大的鼓励。会议举行了戏曲文物文献的展览和戏曲观摩演出晚会。著名的艺人代表举行了三天义演，以全部票价收入慰劳我国抗美援朝的人民志愿部队。
    会议闭幕后，全体代表参加了自己所发起的十日首都文艺界庆祝平壤解放的盛大的示威游行，情绪至为热烈。
