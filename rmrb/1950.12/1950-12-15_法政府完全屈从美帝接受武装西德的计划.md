Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: Two and a half months ago, at the North Atlantic aggressive bloc's New York meeting, the French Pleven government, fearing resistance from its own people, did not dare to fully accept the so-called "realistic" American plan to arm West Germany. Recently, under American pressure, it has succumbed and, under the guise of a so-called "compromise," accepted the American plan to immediately establish thirty brigades of West German troops. A French government spokesperson publicly announced on the 6th that, after cabinet meetings on the 5th and 6th, the Pleven government had decided to abandon its previous position that the establishment of West German troops must be conditional on the establishment of a supranational unified Western European body, the appointment of a unified Western European "defense" minister, and the implementation of the Schuman Plan. Instead, it agreed to the so-called Dutch compromise proposal passed by the assistant foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 5th, the so-called Dutch compromise proposal stipulates that German combat troops equivalent to brigades, each unit consisting of five to six thousand men, should be formed immediately. The total number of German troops planned to be established in the first batch will reach one-fifth of the current total number of troops in Western European countries, approximately 150,000 men. After being formed, they will be equally incorporated into the North Atlantic collective aggressive army under the unified command of the Americans, together with the troops of Western European countries, and deployed on the entire front line from the Arctic Sea to the Aegean Sea, that is, re-enter the Western European countries that they still occupied six years ago. Therefore, this plan is virtually the same as the American demands at the New York meeting; the so-called "compromise" is only to temporarily not establish the organizational structure of German divisions, nor to establish a German military headquarters and chief of staff.

The French government's acceptance of the American plan is the result of the United States' constantly increasing pressure during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's assistant foreign ministers' meeting held in London since November 13th. When former Marshall Plan executor Hoffman negotiated with French Prime Minister Pleven in November, he threatened France to its face that if it did not change its position on establishing an "independent German army," the "aid" given to it by the Marshall Plan and the American military loans to France might be reduced. He also warned that American "military assistance" to the offensive against the Vietnamese people would be given directly to Bảo Đại. Former U.S. President Hoover even suggested that "economic and military aid to Europe should be suspended until a unified and adequate European army appears."

Due to France's capitulation, the North Atlantic assistant foreign ministers' meeting adjourned on December 7th. Now the United States is preparing, on this basis, to immediately begin concretely establishing the North Atlantic collective aggressive army with the West German army as its backbone, in preparation for a larger-scale war of aggression. To this end, the North Atlantic aggressive bloc has scheduled a series of meetings in London starting on the 12th of this month to discuss solutions to this problem.

    法政府完全屈从美帝接受武装西德的计划
    【新华社十四日讯】两个半月前在北大西洋侵略集团纽约会议上，由于害怕国内人民的反抗而不敢全盘接受美国关于武装西德的所谓“现实”计划的法国普利文政府，最近已在美国压力下屈服，而在所谓“折衷办法”的掩饰下，接受了美国关于立即建立三十个旅西德军的计划。法国政府受权发言人士已于六日公开宣布，普利文政府在经五六两日内阁会议后，已决议放弃法国政府过去所持建立西德军必须以成立超国家的西欧统一机构，任命西欧统一的“防务”部长，与实行舒曼计划为前提的意见，而同意北大西洋公约外长助理会议通过的所谓荷兰折衷方案，据美联社伦敦五日电透露：所谓荷兰折衷方案规定：立即编建每单位五六千人相当于旅的德国战斗部队。首批计划建立的德国军队，总数将达目前西欧各国军队总数五分之一，约十五万人，而在编成以后将与西欧各国军队平等地编入归美国人统一指挥的北大西洋集体侵略军，在自北极海以迄爱琴海的全线布防，亦即重新开入他们六年前还在他们占领下的西欧国家。因此这个方案实际上与美国在纽约会上的要求几无二致，所谓“折衷”只是暂时不成立德国师的建制，不成立德军参谋总部与参谋总长而已。
    法国政府之接受美国计划，乃是美国在自十一月十三日起在伦敦举行的北大西洋公约外长助理会议上与会外不断增加压力的结果，前马歇尔计划执行人霍夫曼在十一月与法国总理普利文谈判时，曾当面恫吓法国如不改变它对建立“独立的德国军队”的立场，则马歇尔计划给它的“援助”和美国给法国的军事贷款可能削减。并警告说：美国对进攻越南人民的“军事援助”将直接给予保大。美国前总统胡佛甚至建议“在一支统一而足够的欧洲军队出现之前，应暂停对欧洲的经济和军事援助。”
    由于法国的屈膝，北大西洋外长助理会已于十二月七日宣告休会，现在美国正准备在这个基础上立即进一步着手具体建立以西德军为骨干的北大西洋集体侵略军，以准备更大规模的侵略战争。为此，北大西洋侵略集团已定于本月十二日起连续在伦敦举行一系列会议，以谋解决这一问题。
