	Yang Youde Earnestly Learns from Soviet Experience
	Productivity Increases 21.5 Times
	[This newspaper reported] Yang Youde, a lathe worker at the Shenyang Fourth Machine Factory, used a Soviet lathe. Because the lathe's turning speed was too fast and his operating skills couldn't keep up, he felt his heart pounding when he worked on it. He didn't dare speak, didn't dare use a large cutting tool, and didn't dare continue working once the machine got hot. Recently, in the enthusiastic patriotic production competition, the workers were all trying to improve their skills and increase production. Yang Youde, a member of the Communist Youth League, certainly didn't want to lag behind. He pondered day and night about how to improve his skills. At this time, Rong Yuting, the director of their workshop, returned from the Third Machine Factory after watching a demonstration of high-speed cutting operation methods by Soviet experts and summoned all the workers to promote it. Yang Youde listened while experimenting at the lathe. He said, "Why can't our lathe do that?" Rong Yuting said, "We really underestimated the efficiency of this lathe before." From then on, Yang Youde was inspired by the operating methods of Soviet experts. While working, he pondered and further researched the operating methods of Soviet experts. As a result, what originally took ninety minutes to turn a cold steel wheel can now be shortened to four minutes. Labor productivity has increased 21.5 times, and the quality has also improved from second-grade products to 100% first-grade products. As a result, everyone felt that to increase production, it was necessary to learn from the Soviet experience.

    杨有德认真学习苏联经验
    生产率提高廿一倍半
    【本报讯】沈阳第四机器厂车床工人杨有德，使用的是苏联车床，因为车床转运速度太快，自己的操作技术跟不上，他车起活来心都嘣嘣跳，话都不敢说，也不敢车大刀，床子一热就不敢再车了。最近，工友们在热烈的爱国主义生产竞赛中，都在想法改进技术，提高生产。杨有德是个青年团员，当然更不落后。他日夜寻思着要改进技术。这时，他们的车间主任荣雨亭从第三机器厂看了苏联专家的高速度切削操作方法表演回来，就召集全体工友宣传。杨有德这时一面听，一面在车床边比试。他说：“我们这车床怎不行呢？”荣雨亭说：“咱们以前真是辜负这床子的效能了。”杨有德从此受了苏联专家操作方法的启示，一边干活，一边琢磨，进一步研究苏联专家的操作方法，结果，原来九十分钟车一个冷钢轮，现在已能缩短到四分钟，劳动生产率提高了二十一倍半，质量也由二级品提高到百分之百的一级品。这样一来，大家就都感到，要提高生产，必须学习苏联的经验。

    九日本报第二版《燕大千余人签名宣言》消息第二十二行中之“清华大学”应为“燕京大学”。最后签名中“侯仁元”“孙德哀”“刘诚钊”“钱家驹”应为“侯仁之”“孙德斤”“刘承钊”“千家驹”。
    八日一版《京津沈阳等地热烈庆贺平壤解放》消息第三栏第十行“河北高工”，应为“国立高工”。
