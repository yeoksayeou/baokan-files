    Xinhua News Agency, November 20th: Further developing credit cooperative undertakings has become one of the urgent problems to be solved in the rural areas of North China.
    After land reform, the development of production in the vast rural areas of North China has led to two new situations: first, many well-to-do farmers have begun to have surplus grain and are demanding savings facilities. For example, in Wu Xiang County in the grain producing area of Shanxi, 43% of farmers have year-round grain reserves of one to ten *shi* (石 - a unit of dry measure). Individual households have grain reserves of up to one hundred *shi*. In Dacheng Village, Cheng'an County in the cotton producing area of Hebei, households with more than 500 *jin* (斤 - a unit of weight) of surplus grain account for 12% of the total number of households in the village. The second situation is that some farmers urgently need loans due to a lack of means of production or unexpected disasters, illnesses, or deaths; however, they often have to sell their land because they cannot borrow money. According to a survey of six villages in Wu Xiang County, more than 4% of the total number of households have been forced to lose their land as a result.
    In order to help farmers facing unexpected difficulties to continue production and not fall into poverty again, in addition to national banks absorbing farmers' surplus grain and issuing agricultural loans, some areas of various provinces in North China have established credit cooperative undertakings. Seventeen credit cooperatives and seventy-six supply and marketing cooperatives with credit departments have been established in Shanxi Province. According to statistics from forty-five of these cooperatives and departments, they have absorbed 450,000 *jin* of grain and loaned out 650,000 *jin* in the past six months, enabling thousands of farmers to purchase more than 500 head of livestock, more than 2,000 pieces of farm equipment, and more than 7,000 *jin* of fertilizer in a timely manner. Since October of last year, Daming County in Hebei Province has also established eighty-five credit cooperatives and credit sections attached to supply and marketing cooperatives, absorbing a total of 1.2 million *jin* of surplus grain and lending it to farmers in need. Similar credit activities have also been carried out in individual areas of Pingyuan and Chahar Provinces, and have been warmly welcomed by farmers.
    However, under the current circumstances, the existing credit and loan organizations and activities are still far from meeting the needs of the vast number of farmers. Compared with the hundreds of thousands of villages in North China, the existing two hundred and three credit cooperatives and credit sections attached to supply and marketing cooperatives in North China account for only about one in a thousand. Moreover, national banks can only issue agricultural loans on a key point basis at present. This situation makes farmers in need of loans feel deeply difficult, and high-interest loans have begun to grow in some areas as a result. In Fenyang and Zhaocheng counties in Shanxi, there have been abnormal phenomena such as borrowing seventy in the spring and repaying one hundred and fifty in the autumn, or borrowing one and repaying two. Therefore, widely carrying out rural credit activities has become an urgent task in the current countryside.

    Developing Credit Work Should First Remove Farmers' Concerns
    Interest Should Be Agreed Upon According to General Standards
    According to the existing experience in various places, the establishment of credit cooperatives must first remove farmers' concerns. For example, when the Qingyuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei began to carry out credit work in Xibaicheng Village and mobilized farmers to deposit grain in the cooperative, it was found that farmers were worried about "showing off their wealth," being "untrustworthy," "returning bad grain for good grain," and "inconvenience of withdrawing after depositing," and even worried about "the government abolishing debts again and struggling against exploitation in the future." Therefore, it is very necessary to correctly explain the policy of free lending and the significance of establishing credit cooperatives to farmers. Less than a month after the publicity work was carried out in the village, six households deposited more than 900 *jin* of surplus grain into the credit section of the supply and marketing cooperative. When the credit section proactively notified the depositors to collect the principal and interest upon maturity, the farmers were completely relieved. Therefore, in the past six months, 32% of the farmers in the village have deposited more than 15,000 *jin* of wheat in the cooperative. However, mobilizing farmers to deposit grain must be based on conscious voluntariness. Individual counties in Chahar Province have experienced deviations of forced lending and infringing on the interests of middle peasants, which has deepened farmers' concerns and seriously affected the development of lending activities. Secondly, in terms of interest rates, according to the experience in various places, it is appropriate to negotiate interest rates independently based on the interest rates of national banks and the general interest rates of private lending. Too high or too low interest rates will lead to the tendency of saving less and lending more, or saving more and lending less, which will affect the normal development of credit business.

### 华北农民要求储蓄和借贷  急待开展信贷合作事业

    华北农民要求储蓄和借贷
    急待开展信贷合作事业
    【新华社十一月二十日讯】进一步开展信贷合作事业已成为华北农村中急待解放的问题之一。
    经过土地改革后发展了生产的华北广大农村，已出现了两种新情况：一是不少富裕农民开始有了余粮，要求储蓄。如山西谷产区的武乡县，百分之四十三的农户通年存粮已达一石到十石之多。个别户存粮到一百石。河北棉产区成安县大姚堡村，余粮五百斤以上的农户已占全村总户数的百分之十二。另一种是有些农民因缺乏生产资料或遇到意外的灾害、疾病、死亡等，急需借贷；但往往因为借不到钱，不得不出卖土地。据武乡县六个村的调查，因此而被迫失去土地的农户已达总户数的百分之四以上。
    为了帮助遇到意外困难的农民能继续生产，不致再陷入贫困，除国家银行吸收农民余粮与发放农业贷款外，华北各省部分地区曾创办了信用合作事业。山西全省已建立了十七个信用合作社和七十六个供销合作社附设的信用部。据其中四十五个社、部的统计：半年来已吸收存粮四十五万斤，贷出六十五万斤，使上千户农民及时购买了五百多头牲口、二千多件农具、七千多斤肥料。河北省大名县自去年十月以来，也建立了八十五个信用合作社与供销社附设的信贷股，共吸收了一百二十万斤余粮，贷给了有困难的农民。平原、察哈尔两省个别地区也展开了同样的信贷活动，受到农民热烈的欢迎。
    但在目前情况下，现有的信用借贷组织与活动，距离广大农民的要求还很远。以华北各地现有的二百零三个信用合作社和供销合作社附设的信贷股与华北十多万村庄相比，则仅占千分之一左右。而国家银行的农业贷款，目前也只能是重点发放。这种情况使需要借贷的农民深感困难；亦使少数地区高利贷开始乘机滋长。山西汾阳、赵城等县，已有春借七十、秋还一百五或借一还二的不正常现象。因此，广泛地开展农村信贷活动，已成为目前农村中的一项迫切的工作。
    开展信贷工作应先解除农民顾虑
    根据一般标准自行议订利息为宜
    根据各地已有的经验，信用合作社的建立，首先必需解除农民的顾虑。如河北清苑县供销合作社开始在西白城村开展信贷工作、动员农民向合作社存粮时，发现农民有怕“露富”、怕“不讲信用”、怕“存好粮还坏粮”以及怕“存入后取用不便”等顾虑，甚或有怕“公家再废债，将来借贷按剥削斗争”的。因此，向农民正确地解释自由借贷政策和建立信用合作社的意义，就十分必要。该村在经过宣传工作后不到一月，就有六户将余粮九百余斤存入该供销合作社的信贷股，并在到期后，信贷股又主动地通知存户来领取本利，农民才完全放心。所以半年来该村已有百分之三十二的农户向合作社存入小麦一万五千斤之多。但动员农民存粮，必须建立在自觉自愿的基础上，察哈尔省个别县份曾发生强迫借贷、侵犯中农利益的偏向，使农民顾虑加深，严重地影响了借贷活动的展开。其次，在利息方面，根据各地经验，以国家银行利息和私人借贷的一般利息标准，自行议订为宜，过高或过低，都会发生存少贷多或存多贷少的偏向，影响信贷业务的正常开展。
