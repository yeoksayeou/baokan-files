    Oppose the US's Illegal Use of Japan as a Base for Aggression Against Korea
    Zhuang Tao
    On October 26th of this year, US State Department advisor Dulles submitted to the Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik, a memorandum from the US government regarding the peace treaty with Japan. Article 4 of this memorandum stated: "Japanese facilities have the responsibility of continuing to cooperate with the US or other armies to maintain international peace and security in the Japanese region." This notorious war criminal seems to want all the good people in the world to believe that all its military installations in Japan are merely for maintaining peace and security in the Japanese region. However, America's crimes in Japan cannot be concealed by lies. Because everyone knows that Japan, which has not yet ended its war relationship with the Allied countries and is expressly prohibited from possessing arms by the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission, today not only has some of its military personnel openly and directly participating in the war of aggression against Korea, but all its military facilities have not only not been dismantled, but have been continuously strengthened and expanded, and are being illegally used by MacArthur to slaughter the Korean people who were only recently liberated from the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders. This is an obvious fact that no one can hide.

    Japan is the Sea and Air Base for the US Troops Invading Korea
    War criminal MacArthur, in order to launch aggression in the East, had painstakingly carried out long-term preparations. In the past five years, in addition to restoring and strengthening Japan's existing air force bases, he has also added a large number of new airports. Today, Japan, from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south, has formed an air force base network. The largest of these, Misawa Airport, located in northern Honshu, is the headquarters of the US Pacific Jet Force, with an 8,500-foot runway capable of handling large heavy bombers. Many other airports also have equipment for heavy bombers to take off and land. Currently, the US imperialist air force invading Korea is carrying out inhumane bombing of peaceful cities in Korea and our northeastern border from these airports. According to materials published by the US government on October 3rd, since June 26th, the invading air force has dispatched 40,600 sorties, dropping a total of 29,700 tons of bombs and 63,000 rockets. Recently, in order to strengthen the air force base in the Kyushu area of Japan, which is closer to Korea, the US military is mobilizing telecommunications technicians from all over Japan to greatly expand the telecommunications facilities connecting the airports in Kyushu.
    The old Japanese naval base, Yokosuka, is openly boasted by the US imperialists as its only powerful naval base west of Pearl Harbor. The port can accommodate a special fleet composed of two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and eight destroyers, as well as barracks sufficient for four US Army divisions. The port also has a highly efficient naval arsenal, equipped with giant overhead cranes and modern repair machinery. In addition, the old Japanese naval bases in Sasebo on the west coast of Kyushu and Kure in the Seto Inland Sea have also been greatly expanded. Recently, in order to strengthen the naval base for the invasion of Korea, the US imperialists have decided to open a new military port in Matsuyama City along the Seto Inland Sea. These old Japanese naval bases are now becoming nests for the US imperialist navy to launch piratical acts against the Korean coast.
    We must not forget that today Tokyo, Japan, is the command center for the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea. In order to strengthen direct communication between the Tokyo headquarters and its subordinate departments and southern Korea, MacArthur is actively expanding the communication network in Kyushu, Japan. At present, there are as many as 200 telephone and telecommunications lines connecting Tokyo and southern Korea through Fukuoka Prefecture in northern Kyushu. Therefore, most of the materials stored in the Material Department of the Electrical Communication Ministry of the Japanese government have been transported to Kyushu.

    Japan is a Military Supply Base for the US Troops Invading Korea
    In the past five years, MacArthur's deliberate plot to support Japan's military industry has become clear to everyone today. According to the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shinpo on October 28th, in the three months from the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea on June 25th to the end of September, the total amount of so-called special needs (referred to as special needs) spent by the US imperialists in Japan to search for military supplies, issue military orders, and hire a large number of Japanese personnel for military needs, has reached 37 billion yen, equivalent to 110 million US dollars. The monthly average is more than 35 million US dollars. As of November 5th, it reached 140 million US dollars. It is estimated that it may exceed 200 million US dollars within this year (Japanese Diamond Magazine, October 11th).
    Of the above-mentioned 37 billion yen in total special needs for the US imperialist invasion of Korea, expenditures on materials accounted for 23 billion yen; expenditures on labor accounted for 14 billion yen. According to a survey by the Economic Stabilization Board of the Japanese government, the military supplies searched for by the US imperialists are of various kinds, including all kinds of military supplies from steel plates to canned goods, among which vehicles, machinery, and steel products are the largest, accounting for more than half of the total special needs materials. At present, Japan's three major automobile companies, "Nissan", "Toyota", and "Isuzu", have received orders from the US Eighth Army Supply Department for 7,059 military trucks, which will be delivered in two batches in November this year and February next year, with a monthly production of about 1,000 military trucks for the US imperialists. Steel products include steel plates for positions and bases, rails for railways, shaped steel for bridges, oil tanks for oil storage, and barbed wire. Fiber products, which rank third in the total amount of special needs materials, are 80% burlap bags for making sandbags. In three months, the US imperialists purchased 4 million US dollars worth of new and old burlap bags in Japan. In order to strengthen and expand Japan's sea and air bases, the US imperialists are also searching for a large amount of cement and gravel, of which gravel alone has been transported more than 2 million tons from all over Japan. In addition, in three months, Japan also supplied the US imperialists with a large amount of timber, 2,000 mobile barracks, a large number of mobile bridges, mobile warehouses, various land and submarine cables, wires for electromechanical explosions, and medical supplies. Timber alone amounted to 10 million cubic Japanese feet (one Japanese foot is approximately equal to one Chinese foot), and 63% of the timber was used to manufacture wooden boxes for packaging various munitions, machinery, and military supplies (the above are all from the Japanese Economist Magazine on October 21st and the Japanese Diamond Magazine in mid-October).
    Of course, we cannot see materials about Japan directly supplying the US imperialists with weapons of murder in Japanese public newspapers. According to a Dentsu dispatch from Manila on November 17th, three old Japanese state-owned arsenals have started work under the guidance of the US occupation authorities; the production of the Sagamihara tank factory is approaching the pre-war level; and Mitsubishi Trust and Koyo Precision Industries are supplying the US imperialist invading troops with long-range artillery.
    Of the 14 billion yen (approximately 39 million US dollars) in labor costs, which account for nearly 40% of the total special needs for the US imperialist invasion of Korea, according to the Japanese Economist Magazine on October 21st, repair and assembly costs of various equipment ranked first, amounting to 19 million US dollars. At present, Japan is not only supplying the US imperialists with materials for the invasion of Korea, but also serving as the US imperialists' repair base. As early as before the war of aggression against Korea, the US imperialists equipped the Shimo-Maruko factory of East Japan Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (formerly Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.), the Akabane factory of Japan Steel Works, etc., to make them repair and assembly factories for weapons and vehicles. These factories manufactured tanks for the Japanese military during World War II, and now they are repairing various weapons and machinery damaged in the US war of aggression against Korea, such as tanks, anti-aircraft guns, artillery, generators, and vehicles. Shipyards in Japanese ports are repairing ships and warships for the US military. Various weapons used by the US imperialists to invade Korea, such as airplanes and tanks, are also transported from the United States to Japan for assembly. These repairs and assemblies are carried out under the direct supervision of the US Eighth Army. Therefore, the US Eighth Army directly employs as many as 145,000 Japanese personnel, according to the same magazine mentioned above.

    Transportation costs ranked second in the labor costs for the invasion of Korea, accounting for approximately 7.8 million US dollars. Of which, railway freight accounted for 6 million US dollars; the rest was shipping costs. At present, there are more than 60 Japanese ships, totaling 300,000 tons, transporting materials for the US imperialists to invade Korea, accounting for one-sixth of the total amount of ships in Japan. In addition, there are telephone and telegraph fees, handling fees, warehouse fees, etc.
    From this, it can be seen that not only are Japan's seaports, airports, and military factories being used by the US imperialists, but also Japan's peaceful industry, railways, ships, warehouses, and manpower are being used by the US imperialists for aggression against Korea. Today, Japan is, in fact, the closest military supply base for the US imperialists' aggression against Korea and our country.

    We Cannot Tolerate the US Imperialists' Arbitrary Violation of International Agreements
    The above facts of MacArthur's illegal use of Japan as a base for aggression against Korea are only a part of the materials reflected in Japanese public newspapers. However, no matter how incomplete these materials are, they are sufficient to prove the shameful crimes of the US imperialists in arbitrarily tearing up international agreements.
    Everyone knows that Japan is a defeated country in World War II, and because the US imperialists have attempted to occupy Japan for a long time and have been unilaterally delaying the peace treaty with Japan, a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, thereby hindering Japan from establishing normal relations with various countries in the world. Regarding this point, our consistent attitude is, as Foreign Minister Zhou reiterated in his statement on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan on the 4th of this month: "We strive to conclude a common peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible in order to end the state of war with Japan as soon as possible and enable the Japanese people to obtain democracy and peace as soon as possible." However, the US imperialists have not only adopted a completely opposite attitude, but also MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, has completely disregarded the principles of the Allied countries towards Japan as determined by international agreements such as the Potsdam Proclamation signed by the United States, and the policies of the Allied countries towards Japan as determined by the Far Eastern Commission resolution of June 19, 1947, proposed by the United States and discussed and approved by various countries.
    The Potsdam Proclamation clearly pointed out: "The authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated permanently. ... Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war." The Far Eastern Commission resolution of June 19, 1947, more specifically stipulated: "Disarmament and demilitarization are the tasks of the initial period of military occupation...Regardless of any army and navy equipment, army and navy ships, army and navy facilities, and air force and civil aviation belonging to the army and navy, they must be dealt with in accordance with the decisions of the Allied countries...The existing economic foundation of Japan's military power must be destroyed and its revival prohibited. To this end, any production of materials for the purpose of equipping and maintaining military power or military facilities must be immediately stopped and prohibited in the future, and the production or repair of all naval vessels, aircraft, and other war tools must be prohibited."
    Today, MacArthur is using the military power of defeated Japan, blatantly disregarding everything, invading Korea and our country, and attempting to retrace the old path taken by Japanese imperialism. MacArthur's illegal actions not only endanger the people of Korea and our country, but also endanger the interests of the Japanese people. Before and after launching the war of aggression against Korea, in order to consolidate his rear for the war of aggression, MacArthur launched a cruel attack on the Japanese people, "purging" all members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, closing more than 1,000 progressive newspapers and periodicals in Japan, disbanding the National Federation of Labor Unions, a nationwide progressive workers' organization, and expelling tens of thousands of progressive elements from factories, schools, and organizations. We cannot tolerate the crimes of the US imperialists in arbitrarily tearing up international agreements. The people of our country, who played a great role in defeating Japanese imperialism, have the right to resolutely oppose MacArthur's illegal and shameful actions.

    反对美国非法利用日本作为侵朝基地
    庄涛
    美国国务院顾问杜勒斯，在今年十月二十六日，以美国政府关于对日和约的备忘录一件，递交苏联驻安理会代表马立克，其中第四条提到：“日本的设备，与美国的或其他军队之间，有继续合作以维持日本地区的国际和平与安全的责任。”这个恶迹昭彰的战贩，似乎要世界上善良的人们都来相信，它在日本的一切军事设备，仅仅为了维持日本地区的和平与安全。然而美国在日本的罪行是谎话所掩饰不了的。因为大家都知道，一个尚未与盟国结束战争关系，并为远东委员会决议所明文规定不得拥有武装的日本，今天不仅它的一部分军事人员已经明目张胆地直接参加侵朝战争，而且它的一切军事设备，非但没有拆除，反而不断加强与扩大，正被麦克阿瑟非法地用于屠杀才从日寇铁蹄下解放不久的朝鲜人民。这是有目共睹的事实，谁也无法掩盖的。
    日本是侵朝美军的海空基地
    战犯麦克阿瑟，为了在东方发动侵略，曾苦心积虑地进行了长期准备。五年来，除恢复与加强日本旧有空军基地以外，还增修了大批新的飞机场。现在日本北起北海道，南迄九州，已构成了一个空军基地网。其中最大的三泽机场，位于本州北部，是美太平洋喷气机大队的大本营，设有长八千五百英尺的跑道，可容大型重轰炸机起落。其他很多机场，也都设有可供重轰炸机升降的设备。目前美帝侵朝空军，正从这些飞机场，实行对朝鲜和平城市与我国东北边境的惨无人道的轰炸。根据美国官方十月三日发表的材料，从六月二十六日以来，侵朝空军已延续出动四万另六百架，共投下炸弹二万九千七百余吨，火箭弹六万三千余发。最近美军为了加强离朝鲜较近的日本九州一带空军基地，正从日本各地动员电信技术人员，大事扩充连结九州各飞机场的电信设施。
    日本的旧海军基地横须贺，美帝公开夸耀是它在珍珠港以西的唯一强大海军基地。该港可容由两艘航空母舰、四艘巡洋舰和八艘驱逐舰组成的特种舰队，以及足供四个美国陆军师团用的营房。该港并设有具备高度效能的海军兵工厂，拥用巨型高架起重机及近代修理机械的设备。此外，位于九州西海岸的佐世保、位于濑户内海的吴港等旧日本海军基地，也大为扩充。最近美帝为了加强侵朝的海军基地，已决定在沿濑户内海的松山市，新辟一军港。这些旧日本海军基地，今天正成为美帝侵朝海军向朝鲜沿岸发动海盗行为的巢穴。
    我们更不能忘记，今天日本的东京，正是美帝侵朝战争的指挥中心。麦克阿瑟为了加强东京指挥部及其所属各部与南部朝鲜间的直接联系，积极扩大日本九州的通信网。目前经过北九州福冈县，连结东京与南部朝鲜间的电话、电信线路，已达二百条之多。因此，日本政府电气通信省资材部所存器材，大半已被运往九州。
    日本是侵朝美军的军需供应基地
    五年来，麦克阿瑟蓄意扶植日本军事工业的阴谋，到今天也已昭然若揭。据十月二十八日日本东洋经济新报所载，从六月二十五日侵朝战争爆发至九月末的三个月内，美帝为在日本搜购军用物资、发出军事订单、以及为军事需要雇佣大批日本人员等而支出的所谓特殊需要（简称特需）总额，已达三百七十亿日元，约合一亿一千万美元。每月平均在三千五百万美元以上。截至十一月五日，则达一亿四千万美元。估计今年年内可能超过二亿美元（十月十一日日本金钢钻杂志）。
    以上美帝三百七十亿日元侵朝特需总额中，物资方面的支出占二百三十亿日元；劳务方面的支出占一百四十亿日元。根据日本政府经济安定本部的调查，美帝搜购的军用物资，种类繁多，包括从钢板以至罐头的各种军用品，其中以车辆、机械与钢铁类为大宗，合占特需物资总额的一半以上。目前日本“日产”、“丰田”、“五十铃”三大汽车公司，已接获美第八军供应部七千零五十九辆军用卡车的订单，分今年十一月与明年二月两期交齐，每月约为美帝生产军用卡车一千辆。钢铁类中包括阵地及基地用钢板、铁路用轨条、桥梁用型钢、储油用油罐、及有刺铁丝网等。占特需物资总额第三位的纤维类，则百分之八十为做沙包用麻袋，三个月间，美帝在日本搜购的新旧麻袋，达四百万美元。美帝为加强与扩大日本的海空基地，同时大量搜购洋灰与砂石，其中仅砂石一项，已从日本全国各地征运二百万吨以上。此外，三个月间，日本还供给美帝大量木材，二千幢活动兵营，大批活动桥梁、活动仓库，各种陆上、海底电线，机电爆炸用导线，以及医药用品等。其中仅木材一项，达一千万立方日尺（一日尺约合我国一市尺弱），而百分之六十三的木材，又用于制造包装各种军火、机械与军需品用的木箱（以上均见十月二十一日日本经济学者杂志与十月中旬号日本金钢钻杂志）。
    当然，关于日本直接供给美帝杀人武器的材料，我们不可能从日本公开报刊中看到。据电通社马尼剌十一月十七日电，三家旧日本国营兵工厂，已在美国占领当局指导下开工；相模原坦克制造厂的生产，已接近战前水平；而三菱托辣斯与光洋精密工业公司，正以长射程大炮供给美帝侵朝军队。
    占美帝侵朝特需总额将近百分之四十的一百四十亿日元（约合三千九百万美元）劳务费支出中，据十月二十一日日本经济学者杂志所载，以各种器材的修理与装配费占第一位，即一千九百万美元。目前日本除供应美帝侵朝物资以外，同时也是美帝的修理基地。早在侵朝战争以前，美帝即装备东日本重工业会社（前三菱重工业会社）的下丸子工厂、日本制钢会社的赤羽工厂等，使之成为武器、车辆的修理、装配工厂。这些工厂，在第二次世界大战时，就为日本军部装造坦克，现在则为美军修理在侵朝战争中受创的各种兵器与机械，如坦克、高射炮、大炮、发电机与车辆等。日本各港口的造船厂，则为美军修理船舶、军舰。美帝侵朝的各种武器如飞机、坦克，也由美国运来后在日本进行装配。这些修理与装配，都在美第八军直接监督下执行。因此目前美第八军直接雇佣的日本人员，据上述同一杂志所载，已达十四万五千人。
    占侵朝劳务费第二位的是运输费，约七百八十万美元。其中铁路运费占六百万美元；其他为船费。目前为美帝输送侵朝物资的日本船只，约六十余艘，共三十万吨，占日本现有船舶总量的六分之一。此外则为电话电报费、搬运费、仓库费等。
    由此可见，不仅日本的海港、飞机场、军事工厂被美帝所利用，就是日本的和平工业、铁路、船舶、仓库、人力也为美帝用于侵略朝鲜。今天日本，事实上是美帝侵略朝鲜及我国的最近的军需供应基地。
    我们不能容忍美帝任意撕毁国际协定
    以上麦克阿瑟非法利用日本作为侵朝基地的事实，仅仅是日本公开报刊所反映的一部分资料。但是，尽管这些资料是怎样的不完整，已足以证实美帝任意撕毁国际协定的可耻罪行。
    大家都知道，日本是第二次大战中的战败国，并且由于美帝企图长期占领日本而一味拖延对日和约的结果，使全面的对日和约始终未能缔结，因而阻碍了日本和世界各国建立正常关系。对于这点，我们一贯的态度，正如周外长在其本月四日关于对日和约问题声明中所再度阐明的：“力求于尽可能的短期内，缔结共同对日和约，以便早日结束对日战争状态，使日本人民早日获得民主与和平。”但美帝不仅采取了与此完全相反的态度，而且其身为盟军统帅的麦克阿瑟，在五年来的长期占领中，根本无视有美国签字的波茨坦公告等国际协定所决定的盟国对日原则，与由美国提议经各国讨论通过的一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会决议所决定的盟国对日政策。
    波茨坦公告明确地指出：“欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威权及势力，必须永久剔除。……日本将被允许维持其经济所必需及可以偿付货物赔偿的工业，但可以使其重新武装作战的工业不在其内。”一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会决议更具体地规定：“解除武装与非军事化是军事占领初期的任务………不问任何陆海军器材、陆海军船舶、陆海军设施及陆海军所属空军与民用航空，必须根据盟国决定进行处理………日本军事力量的现有经济基础，必须破坏并禁止其复活，为此立刻停止并在将来禁止、任何以装备与维持军事力量或军事设施为目的的物资生产，并禁止给予一切海军船只、飞机、及其他战争工具的生产或修理的方便。”
    到了今天，麦克阿瑟竟利用战败国日本的军事力量，悍然不顾一切，侵略朝鲜和我国，企图重走日本帝国主义走过的旧路。麦克阿瑟这种非法行为，不仅危害着朝鲜和我国人民，而且也危害着日本人民的利益。在发动侵朝战争前后，麦克阿瑟为了巩固它的侵略战争后方，即向日本人民举行了残酷的进攻，“整肃”日共全部中委，封闭日本一千余种进步报刊，解散全国性的进步工人组织全劳联，以及从工厂、学校、团体中开除成万的进步分子。我们不能容忍美帝任意撕毁国际协定的罪行。在击溃日本帝国主义中曾起伟大作用的我国人民，更有权利坚决反对麦克阿瑟这种非法的、可耻的行为。
