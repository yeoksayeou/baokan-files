Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram to Maurice Thorez, acting Secretary-General of the French Communist Party, to congratulate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the French Communist Party, which falls on December 27th. The telegram reads:

Dear Comrade Duclos and all Comrades of the French Communist Party:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China celebrates the 30th anniversary of the French Communist Party with great joy.

In its thirty years of struggle, the French Communist Party has proven itself to be the most loyal defender of the interests of the French working class and the interests of all the French people.

The French Communist Party and the French working class are uniting all the French people to resolutely oppose the war plans of the U.S. government, which demand that the French people become slaves and sacrifices to U.S. monopoly capital.

The Communist Party of China firmly believes that the struggle of the French Communist Party is just and will inevitably achieve final victory.

Long live the unity of the Chinese and French people in the common struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression!

Long live the French Communist Party and its leader Comrade Maurice Thorez, who are loyal to the interests of the French working class and the international working class!

Long live Comrade Stalin, the leader of the working class and progressive humanity all over the world!

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

Chairman Mao Zedong
