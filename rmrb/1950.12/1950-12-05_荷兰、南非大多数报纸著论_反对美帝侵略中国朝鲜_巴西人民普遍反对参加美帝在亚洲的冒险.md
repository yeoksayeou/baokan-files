    Xinhua News Agency, December 4th dispatch: According to a TASS report from The Hague on the 1st, influential newspapers in the Netherlands oppose American intervention in Korea and China. The Dutch Communist Party's "Truth" newspaper demanded on the 1st that the Dutch government immediately cease assisting the American aggressors and do everything possible to restore peace in Korea and establish friendly relations with China. The paper stated: "The Netherlands should no longer stand with Washington's adventurers. Our answer should be: Down with the Atlantic Pact, no intervention in Korea, peaceful coexistence with China, MacArthur get out!" The non-partisan newspaper "World Business Daily" pointed out: The American war in Korea is fraught with political danger. Even the Catholic newspaper "De Maasbode" sharply condemned the American adventure in Korea and the act of aggression against China, and vehemently denounced the American bombing of Korean towns and villages.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, Prague, 28th: A Reuter's correspondent reported from Cape Town that most newspapers in the Union of South Africa are increasingly uneasy about the American aggression in Korea.
    Natal's "Witness" newspaper demanded the dismissal of MacArthur from his command of the American forces in Korea, stating that "MacArthur's continued command is inappropriate in the interests of world peace." The paper wrote, "The United Nations organization exists to prevent aggression and maintain peace; it does not exist to promote the policies of MacArthur and his partners against China."
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, New York, 30th: Reliable news from Brazil indicates that there is widespread opposition there to Brazil participating in US imperialist adventures in Asia. A Rio de Janeiro radio broadcast: "World News" vehemently attacked the government's negotiations to purchase two warships and other army equipment from the United States. The paper's editor, Rocha, said: The Brazilian people are very worried, because the warships to be purchased "can only mean training soldiers to fight."
    Another radio message reported: An article recently published in the organ of the influential military club attacked American aggression in Korea. It is generally pointed out that this article has aroused heated discussions among the members of that club, which plays a significant role in Brazilian politics.

    荷兰、南非大多数报纸著论
    反对美帝侵略中国朝鲜
    巴西人民普遍反对参加美帝在亚洲的冒险
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社海牙一日讯，荷兰有影响的报纸都反对美国干涉朝鲜和中国。荷兰共产党的真理报在一日要求荷兰政府立即停止援助美国侵略者，并尽一切可能恢复朝鲜的和平以及与中国建立友好关系。该报称：“荷兰不应再与华盛顿的冒险家站在一起。我们的回答应该是：打倒大西洋公约，不准干涉朝鲜，与中国和平共处，麦克阿瑟滚蛋！”无党派报纸世界商报指出：美国在朝鲜的战争充满政治上的危险。甚至天主教报纸《德·玛斯波得》也尖锐地谴责美国在朝鲜的冒险和侵略中国的行动，并痛斥美国滥炸朝鲜的城镇和乡村。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布拉格二十八日电：电通社记者自开普敦来讯称，南非联邦大多数报纸对于美国侵略朝鲜一事日益感到不安。
    纳塔尔的“证人报”要求撤消麦克阿瑟对朝鲜美军的指挥权，并称：麦克阿瑟继续指挥“就世界和平的利益来说是不相宜的”。该报写道，“联合国组织是为了防止侵略和维持和平而存在的；它不是为了助长麦克阿瑟及其伙伴们对中国的政策而存在的。”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约三十日电：巴西传来可靠消息表明，那儿普遍反对巴西参加美帝在亚洲的冒险。里约热内卢广播电台讯：“世界报”剧烈攻击政府谈判向美国购买两艘军舰和其他陆军装备事宜。该报编者罗查说：巴西人民非常担忧，因为要购进的军舰“仅能意味着训练兵员去打仗”。
    另一则广播消息报道说：有势力的军人俱乐部的机关刊物上最近登出一篇文章，攻击美国侵略朝鲜。一般人士指出：这篇文章已引起了在巴西政治中起着重大作用的那俱乐部的会员们的热烈讨论。
