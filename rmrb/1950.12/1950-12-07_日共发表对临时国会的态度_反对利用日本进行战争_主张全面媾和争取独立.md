    Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a report by the United Press, the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) met with a group of reporters on November 21st and announced the JCP's attitude toward the 9th Provisional Diet, which began on the same day, as follows:
    The convocation of this Provisional Diet coincides with the Korean War. The world imperialist bloc is actively preparing to expand the war and transform itself into fascism. Under these circumstances, the colonization and military basing of Japan, and the use of Japan for war, are being carried out on a large scale. In order to strive for independence and oppose war, we must fight with resolute confidence.
    During the Korean War, the intensified crisis of the Japanese nation is the center of the Japanese struggle. In particular, the following points are especially important: (1) Opposition to war. First, investigate the facts of assisting in the intervention of the Korean War, and expose the Yoshida Cabinet's policy of destroying Japan for foreign war purposes and antagonizing the peoples of the Far East. (2) The issue of "Assisting the United Nations." Japan should support the United Nations that abide by the Charter. The United Nations is now being misappropriated as a tool to "legitimize" imperialist wars. (3) The peace treaty issue. Expose the conspiracy of a separate peace treaty (or so-called "majority peace treaty"). Actively promote the JCP's program for a comprehensive peace treaty. (4) The issue of fascism. On the one hand, the reactionaries are "purging" progressive elements, abusing the "Ordinance on the Regulation of Organizations, etc.," violating the Constitution, suppressing and persecuting democratic forces, and on the other hand, they are lifting the purges of reactionary elements, restoring armaments, especially establishing a "Police Reserve Force." These fascist reactionary measures must be combatted.

    日共发表对临时国会的态度
    反对利用日本进行战争 
    主张全面媾和争取独立
    【新华社六日讯】据联合通讯社讯：日本共产党在十一月二十一日接见记者团，发表日共对自该日开始的第九届临时国会所采取的态度如下：
    这次临时国会的召开，正当朝鲜战争时期。世界帝国主义集团正在积极准备扩大战争，并向法西斯化转变。在这种情况之下，日本殖民地化及军事基地化，利用日本进行战争，正在大规模地进行着。为了争取独立与反对战争，我们必须要以坚决的信心进行斗争。
    在朝鲜战争时期中，深刻化了的日本民族危机问题，是日本斗争的中心。特别下列各项尤为重要：（一）反对战争。首先追究协助干涉朝鲜战争的事实，揭露吉田内阁的政策是为了外国的战争目的毁灭日本并与远东各民族为敌的政策。（二）“协助联合国”问题。日本应当支持的是遵守宪章的联合国。现在联合国正被盗用作为使帝国主义战争“合法化”的工具。（三）和约问题。揭露单独和约（或所谓“多数和约”）的阴谋。积极宣传日共的全面媾和纲领。（四）法西斯主义问题。反动派一方面“整肃”进步人士、滥用“团体等规正令”、违反宪法、镇压并迫害民主势力，另一方面则解除反动分子的整肃、恢复军备、特别是建立“警察后备队”，对于这些法西斯反动措施，必须予以打击。
