The Tianjin Daily Publishes Editorial Pointing Out:
    Suppressing the Sabotage Activities of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek Special Agents is a Serious Task in the Current Struggle Against the Enemy

    The Tianjin Daily published an editorial on December 2nd entitled "Suppressing the Sabotage Activities of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek Special Agents is a Serious Task in the Current Struggle Against the Enemy," emphasizing the great significance of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau's cracking of a major Chiang Kai-shek secret agent organization. The editorial stated: "Our loyal, brave, and vigilant People's Public Security organs recently cracked the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's important special agent organization dispatched from Taiwan, the 'Bureau of Investigation and Statistics Directly Subordinate Tianjin Special Group.' The cracking of this huge case timely struck at the conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits attempting to strengthen special agent activities under the current international situation. This is another glorious and great victory for our People's Public Security organs on the 'invisible front'!" After describing the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracies and sabotage activities against our country, the editorial said: "The new situation presents us with a serious task, which is to increase vigilance a hundredfold and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities." The editorial said: "If there is insufficient understanding of the new tasks under this new situation, political errors will be committed."

    The editorial pointed out: "The phenomenon of turning a blind eye to the sabotage activities or rumors and slanders of counter-revolutionaries, failing to investigate and failing to wage struggle, is an irresponsible and decadent manifestation of liberalism towards the country and the people, and must be opposed." The editorial also pointed out: "Some cadres are still very negligent in preserving state secrets; confidential documents are printed and distributed carelessly, and the phenomenon of loss is quite serious. Some comrades arbitrarily engage in 'small broadcasts,' casually talking and asking questions. This is a violation of discipline, and this phenomenon must also be opposed."

    The editorial also stated: "In the broad masses, in conjunction with current affairs, systematic education on preventing spies, maintaining confidentiality, and eliminating special agent saboteurs should be carried out. Mass-based security organizations should be established or improved in general factories, railways, warehouses, and important organs to carry out mass-based anti-traitor struggles."

    天津日报发表社论指出：
    镇压美蒋特务破坏活动是当前对敌斗争的严重任务
    天津日报于十二月二日为此发表题为“镇压美蒋特务破坏活动是当前对敌斗争的严重任务”的社论，评论强调指出天津公安局破获蒋匪重要特务组织的重大意义。社论称：“我们忠勇机警的人民公安机关，最近破获了蒋匪由台湾派遣的重要特务组织‘保密局直属天津特别组’。这一巨大案件的破获，适时地打击了在目前国际形势下蒋匪妄图加强特务活动的阴谋，这是我们人民公安机关在‘无形的战线’上又一次光辉大胜利！”社论在叙述美蒋对我国进行的阴谋破坏活动后，说：“新的形势，向我们提出了一个严重任务，就是必须百倍地提高警惕，坚决镇压反革命活动”，社论说：“倘若对这种新形势下的新任务认识不足，便会犯政治上的错误。”
    社论指出：“那种对于反革命的破坏活动或谣言诽谤，熟视无睹，不加追究，不进行斗争的现象，是对国家对人民不负责任的腐朽的自由主义的表现，必须加以反对。”社论并指出：“有些干部对保守国家的机密，仍然十分疏忽，机密文件乱印乱发，丢失现象相当严重，有些同志肆意‘小广播’，乱谈乱问，这是违反纪律的事情，这种现象也必须加以反对。”
    社论并称：“应在广大群众中结合目前时事，有系统地进行防奸保密、铲除特务破坏分子的教育。应在一般工厂、铁路、仓库和重要机关中建立或健全群众性的安全组织，开展群众性的锄奸斗争。”
