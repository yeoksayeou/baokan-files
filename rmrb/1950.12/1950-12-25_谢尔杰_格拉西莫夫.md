Sergei Gerasimov—I had heard his name for a long time and had seen many of his creations—films. But my acquaintance and friendship with him began during the month I spent accompanying the Soviet cultural workers' delegation in China last year. Gerasimov was one of the official representatives at that time. In the list of the delegation given to us by the Soviet side, he was listed among the top. Professor, film director, People's Artist of the Soviet Union, Stalin Prize winner, Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Standing Committee Member of the All-Soviet Union Congress for the Defense of World Peace—these titles indicated his status.

Handsome, with a slightly bald head, a pair of bright eyes, and a small, beautiful beard, Gerasimov gave us the impression of being a very talented and highly cultivated person. In general Soviet commentary, his directorial style is considered to be characterized by conciseness and concreteness, simplicity and clarity. I think these are also characteristics of his personality. His main films, such as *The Seven Brave Men*, *Komsomolsk*, *The Teacher*, *Masquerade*, *The Countryside*, *The Invincible*, *The Young Guard*, etc., are all full of the truth of life and profound ideological content. It should be pointed out that he wrote the screenplays for all the films he directed. His literary talent can also be seen in his many travelogues about China (published in Soviet literary magazines and serialized in *Izvestia*).

Gerasimov worked diligently for a year to produce the color film *Liberated China*. Like everyone in the Soviet cultural delegation, he read many books and periodicals about China before setting foot on Chinese soil and studied the historical issues of the Chinese revolution. His respect and love for China, the Chinese nation, and the Chinese people became stronger as he came to China three times, traveled to some cities and villages in North China, East China, Central South China, and Northeast China, and came into contact with the broad masses of Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and people's leaders. Once, he said that what he saw in China, no matter what kind of profession a person had, even if they were only doing a small job, even if they were wearing very simple or even ragged clothes... made him feel that this was a completely accomplished nation. There is a profound and bottomless culture here. After a pause, he added that as for the Americans, there is no complete nation there, no culture that can be called culture, there is only buying and selling. When he said this, he showed an expression of indignation and contempt. We completely agree with him and hate, despise, and scorn the American bandits even more, because we have suffered too deeply from the bullying and insults of the American devils! We have learned too much about American "civilization" and "culture"! Today, American imperialists are invading Korea and our Taiwan, directly threatening the security of our country, and we Chinese people cannot tolerate this in particular!

In contrast to the American and British aggressive groups, who are determined to enslave and slaughter the Chinese people, the Soviet people, the people of socialist society, the new people nurtured by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, who have never existed in the world, have infinite enthusiasm and brotherly friendship for China and the working people of the world. The close unity and mutual assistance between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union can be seen in the two color films successfully co-produced by Chinese and Soviet filmmakers, headed by Gerasimov and Varlamov.

*Liberated China*, directed by Gerasimov, can be said to be a masterpiece that shines in succession to *The Victory of the Chinese People*, directed by Varlamov, and has its own characteristics. *Liberated China* describes the great historical achievements of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in leading our people in the liberation struggle over the past 30 years and in achieving great victories throughout the country, and in actively carrying out construction. This is a profound and educational epic. At the beginning of the film, the vastness and abundance of China and its long history are shown, and the poetic, majestic, and magnificent atmosphere and tone immediately amaze the audience and give rise to patriotism. Then, the film traces back the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle for a hundred years since the Opium War... until the overthrow of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique supported and directed by American imperialism, and at the same time driving American imperialism out of mainland China, the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people's great liberation, actively restoring production, building their own happiness and civilization, Sino-Soviet friendship, defending world peace... Countless shots, beautiful and breathtaking. It should be known that putting the history of the Chinese people's struggle for more than a hundred years into a film that can only be screened for about one hour and thirty minutes is an exceptionally arduous task. But thanks to the observation and selection of the leaders, and thanks to the assistance of Chinese comrades in all aspects, Gerasimov succeeded, the filmmakers of China and the Soviet Union succeeded, how can we not sincerely congratulate them?

Today, the American imperialists and their servants are frantically attacking the Korean people and are determined to expand the war of aggression, directly threatening the security of our country, and obstructing and hindering our peaceful labor and peaceful construction. After watching this film, our people will surely be more aroused with love for the motherland, cherish the history of the heroic struggle of the people themselves, hate the brutality and shamelessness of the American aggressor bandits even more, and be determined to unite more closely under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong, and vow to fight back the attack of the American imperialist bandits to defend our new China, to protect our 475 million great, excellent, hardworking, brave, peace-loving, and free people. The merit of this film, the merit of the filmmakers of China and the Soviet Union, and the merit of Gerasimov, goes far beyond the scope of specialized film art.

    谢尔杰·格拉西莫夫
    谢尔杰·格拉西莫夫，我闻其名已很久了，也看过他的许多创作——影片。但是和他相识以至于要好，却是从去年陪同苏联文化工作者代表团在中国一个多月的时期开始的。格拉西莫夫那时是正式代表之一。苏联方面给我们的代表团名单里，他列在前几名里。教授、电影导演、苏联人民艺术家、斯大林奖金获得者、苏联最高苏维埃代表、全苏拥护世界和平大会常委——这些头衔，表示他的身份。
    清秀的，头顶有点秃的，闪着一对聪明的眼睛和蓄着一小撮美丽的胡子的格拉西莫夫，他给我们的印象，是一个很有才能和有很高修养的人。在苏联一般的评论，认为他的导演手法的特点是简洁而具体，朴素而明晰，我觉得，这些也是他为人的特点。他的影片，主要的如：《七勇士》、《共产主义青年城》、《教员》、《假面舞会》、《大地》、《不可被战胜的》、《青年近卫军》……都充满着生活的真理和深刻的思想性。应该指出，他所导演的一切影片的剧本，都是他自己写作的。他的文学才能，也可从他所写的关于中国的许多篇游记里（发表在苏联的文学杂志上和连载在《消息报》上）看得出来。
    为了制作《解放了的中国》这部彩色片子，格拉西莫夫认真地工作了一年。和苏联文化代表团的每个人一样，他在没有踏入中国土地之前，读了许多关于中国的书刊，研究了关于中国革命的历史诸问题。他对中国、中国民族与中国人民的尊敬与爱好，由于他三次来华，走遍华北、华东、华中南、东北某些城市和乡村以及与广大的中国工人、农民、兵士、学生和人民的领导者接触而更加强烈。有一次，他说：他在中国所见的，无论是那种职业的人，那怕是仅仅作点小小工作的，那怕是穿着很简陋甚至破破烂烂……但都使人感觉到，这是一个完全成就了的民族。这里有一种深邃无底的文化。停一会，他又说，至于美国人，那里没有完整的民族，没有可以称之为文化的文化，那里有的只是买卖。他说到这里时，露出一种愤恨和鄙视的神气。我们完全同意他，而且比他更要仇视，鄙视，藐视美国强盗，因为我们受美国鬼子的欺凌侮辱实在太深了！我们对美国的“文明”、“文化”，领教的太多了！今天美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜和我国的台湾，直接威胁我们国家的安全，我们中国人民是尤其不能容忍的呵！
    和美英侵略集团之专门要奴役和杀戮我中国人民者相反，苏联人民，社会主义社会的、列宁斯大林党教养的、世界上从来没有过的崭新的人，对中国以及全世界的劳动人民是抱着无限热诚和兄弟般的友谊的。中苏两大民族亲密的团结互助，从以格拉西莫夫和瓦尔拉莫夫为首的中苏两国电影工作者合作成功的两部彩色影片，便可见其一斑。
    格拉西莫夫主制的《解放了的中国》可说是和瓦尔拉莫夫主制的《中国人民的胜利》先后辉映的杰作，而自有其特点。《解放了的中国》是途述中国共产党和中国人民伟大领袖毛主席在最近这三十年以来领导我国人民进行解放斗争，及在全国范围内取得伟大胜利，积极进行建设的伟大史迹。这是一篇深刻的富有教育意义的史诗。银幕上一开始就显示出中国的地大物博和历史悠久，那种充满了诗意的、雄浑壮丽的气氛和色调，立即使观者叫绝并油然而生爱国心。然后片中回溯自从鸦片战争以来中国人民一百年的革命斗争历史……直至推倒那个由美帝国主义支持与指使的蒋介石反动集团，同时就是把美帝国主义驱出中国大陆，中华人民共和国成立，人民大翻身，积极恢复生产，建设自己的幸福与文明，中苏友好，保卫世界和平……无数镜头，美不胜收。要知道，把一百多年中国人民的奋斗史装在放映时间只能在一小时三十分钟左右的影片里，实在是一个异常艰巨的课题。但由于主导者的观察与选择，由于中国同志们在各方面的协助，格拉西莫夫成功了，中苏两国的电影工作者成功了，我们怎能不衷心庆贺呢？
    在今天，美帝国主义者及其仆从们正在疯狂地向朝鲜人民进攻，而且一心扩大侵略战争，直接威胁着我国的安全，阻挠、妨碍我们的和平劳动与和平建设。我国人民看了这部影片，必能更加烧起对于祖国的热爱，对于人民自己英勇斗争历史的珍重，更加仇视美国侵略强盗的残暴凶恶与无耻，而决心更加紧密地团结起来，团结在中国共产党和毛泽东旗帜之下，誓死打退美帝强盗的进攻，以保卫我新中国这一大片干净土，保卫我四万七千五百万伟大、优秀、勤劳、勇敢、爱好和平、自由的人民。这部影片的功劳，中苏两国电影工作者的功劳，格拉西莫夫的功劳，是超出了电影专门艺术范围以外很远和很大了。
