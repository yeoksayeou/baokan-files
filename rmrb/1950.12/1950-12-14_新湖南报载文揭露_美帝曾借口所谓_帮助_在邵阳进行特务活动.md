    *Xin Hunan Bao* Carries Article Exposing
    U.S. Imperialism's Espionage Activities in Shaoyang Under the Guise of "Aid"

    [Xinhua News Agency] Changsha *Xin Hunan Bao* published an article entitled "Shaoyang Rural Industrial 'Demonstration' and U.S. Imperialist Aggression," exposing the crimes of U.S. imperialism in carrying out espionage activities under the guise of the appealing term "helping" China's rural industrialization. The article stated: In 1946, after the Kuomintang pseudo-government's Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) declared its end, U.S. imperialism sent a large number of veterans, secret agents, and hooligans, posing as "experts," carrying dilapidated and leftover military supplies, to Shaoyang, Hunan, to establish so-called rural industrial demonstration groups (later changed to "demonstration offices"), successively establishing eleven so-called "demonstration" factories for sulfuric acid, cement, fertilizer, coking, rice milling, oil pressing, and others. However, some of those "demonstration" factories did not engage in production at all. For example, the sulfuric acid plant did not even light its furnace. Those so-called American experts even bought a batch of ready-made sulfuric acid, poured it from the tower, and let it flow out at the bottom, taking photos and sending them to Shanghai and the United States, trumpeting that "America has helped China build a sulfuric acid plant."
    The article, when discussing the purpose of U.S. imperialism in establishing the "Demonstration Office" there, stated: In 1947, the "Demonstration Office" dispatched three convoys from Shaoyang, heading to Shandan (Gansu), Yunnan, and Qujiang (Guangdong) respectively, surveying resources and residents along the way. In the winter of 1948, it sent three "work teams" to rural areas in Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Gansu, Sichuan, and Xikang, conducting investigations for three months. From the records in their leftover investigation reports regarding detailed county maps of Jiangxi Province, population and transportation statistics, mineral analysis, and construction outlines, it can be seen that U.S. imperialism, under the guise of "helping China's industrialization," was actually carrying out espionage conspiracies to spy on China's mineral resources and strategic materials.
    The circumstances of U.S. imperialism using this organization for espionage activities can also be proven by the secretive activities of the "Demonstration Office" Deputy Director, an American named Stepet. According to Luo Binglin, who worked as a typist at the office, Stepet and others directly contacted Washington. Every time a secret report was sent to Washington, it was typed by Stepet and his wife themselves, often typing until late at night without sleeping. Gong Hanxia, who worked at the office's radio station, said that they could communicate with American press offices in Hankou, Guangzhou, and elsewhere. When Stepet and others left Shaoyang, they packed all the photos and documents into several large boxes and transported them all away by plane.
    The article pointed out: This U.S. imperialist spy agency helped certain bandit leaders of the Kuomintang's 14th and 100th armies escape Shaoyang on their planes before and after the People's Liberation Army liberated the area, and took aerial photos of the Shaoyang area from the planes.

### 新湖南报载文揭露  美帝曾借口所谓“帮助”在邵阳进行特务活动

    新湖南报载文揭露
    美帝曾借口所谓“帮助”在邵阳进行特务活动
    【新华社讯】长沙新湖南报刊载题为《邵阳乡村工业“示范”与美帝侵略》一文，揭露美帝国主义在所谓“帮助”中国乡村工业化的好听名词下进行特务活动的罪行。该文称：一九四六年，国民党伪政府行政院善后救济总署宣布结束以后，美帝国主义又派来大批退伍军人、特务、流氓，冒称“专家”，携带了破烂不堪的残余军用物资，来到湖南邵阳建立所谓乡村工业示范组（后改为“示范处”），先后成立了硫酸、水泥、肥料、炼焦、碾米、榨油等十一个所谓“示范”工厂。但那些“示范”工厂，有些根本就没有进行生产。如硫酸厂连炉子都不燃烧，那些所谓美国专家，曾买一批现成的硫酸，从塔上倒下去，塔底流出来，拍成照片，寄到上海和美国，大肆宣传说：“美国帮助中国建设了硫酸厂。”
    该文在论到美帝国主义在那里设立“示范处”的目的时说：一九四七年，该“示范处”从邵阳派三个车队出发，分别到山丹（甘肃）、云南、曲江（广东）三处，沿途调查物产和居民情况。一九四八年冬季，又派了三个“工作队”到湖北、江西、广东、甘肃、四川、西康等地的农村中去，前后调查了三个月。从他们残留下来的关于江西省分县详图和人口交通等统计以及矿产的分析和建设纲要等调查报告中的记载，可以看出美帝国主义借“帮助中国工业化”为掩护，实际上是为了进行窥探我国矿藏和战略物资等特务阴谋活动。
    美帝国主义利用这一机构，进行特务活动的情形，从该“示范处”副主任美国人史德佩的鬼祟活动中也可以得到证明。据曾在该处任打字员的骆炳麟说：史德佩等直接与华盛顿联系，每次发到华盛顿的密报，都是史德佩夫妇自己打，常常打到半夜三更不睡觉。曾在该处电台上工作过的龚汉侠说：他们和汉口、广州等地的美国新闻处，到处都可通报。史德佩等在离开邵阳时，把所有的照片、文卷装满了若干大箱子全部搬上了飞机运走。
    该文指出：美帝国主义这一特务机构，在人民解放军解放该地前后帮助国民党第十四军、一百军的某些匪首坐他们的飞机逃离了邵阳，并在飞机上照走了邵阳地区的俯视照片。
