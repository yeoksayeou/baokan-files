Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 13th (TASS): Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly Political Committee on December 9th regarding the United States' slanderous case of so-called "Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China interfering in Korea." The full text is as follows:

Some representatives, primarily those from the proposing countries of this proposal, have concentrated their efforts during the discussion to portray the current war in Korea as a war between the armies of the People's Republic of China and the "United Nations" forces. These representatives have strived to make it seem as if the so-called "United Nations" forces—to use the words of the American representative here—are protecting the "rights to freedom of small countries," upholding the principles and interests of the United Nations, and that they are repelling an attack on a government established under the protection of the United Nations.

The US and Britain shamelessly claim the war of aggression against Korea is a UN operation
Their courage to brazenly distort the truth is truly astonishing

The British representative said they are acting for the purposes outlined in the United Nations resolutions, which are limited to defeating the aggressor and establishing a free, independent, and unified Korea. Hearing these statements, one cannot help but be amazed at the courage of these representatives to lie, as they crudely distort the truth and undeniable facts. These representatives attempt to revive the already bankrupt claim of "North Korean aggression." However, many delegations, including the Soviet delegation, have presented numerous documents that have definitively refuted this claim long ago. And now, the only change in this claim is: besides the preposterous lies about North Korean troops attacking the South Korean puppet "government," the instigators and organizers of the Korean military adventure have fabricated new lies, claiming that "Chinese Communist troops" are attacking the United Nations forces, attacking the United Nations!

The US and British representatives both stated here that their troops were sent to Korea for the purposes of the United Nations, to support the principle of collective resistance to aggression. They also cited resolutions passed by the US-British bloc and a majority of representatives from governments supporting this bloc. However, we all know that the actual purpose of the United States, Britain, and several other countries sending troops to Korea not only has nothing in common with the principles and purposes of the United Nations but directly contradicts them. The most credible and reliable witnesses—documents and facts that expose lies and confirm the truth—prove this. These documents and facts were submitted to the Political Committee for consideration at that time. These documents and facts were also presented to the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly. These documents and facts were, are, and continue to be convincing and powerful proof. Those people, such as the US and British representatives and their followers, have been rendered speechless in the face of these facts. However, now they are using their talent for oratory to cite things that have already been refuted, as if they have not been refuted.

Of course, it would have been appropriate if they had refuted the facts we cited at that time. It would have also been appropriate if they had presented evidence of the so-called "North Korean aggression" while we were discussing the Korean issue. But they did not do so at that time, which is completely understandable because they have no facts at all, nor could they have any facts, because the claim of "North Korean aggression" is entirely fabricated, and in reality, the aggression was launched by South Korea. This aggression was launched and carried out by the South Korean puppet army under the direct leadership of General MacArthur and the United States government.

Someone tells us that the United States, Britain, and other countries' troops are indeed protecting the "rights to freedom of small countries" in Korea. But I ask: what freedom is there in South Korea under the rule of the reactionary Syngman Rhee regime, which has been enthusiastically fostered by the American military authorities—the de facto authority there—for many years? Have we all forgotten the outrageous facts that characterize the fascist Syngman Rhee regime, such as lawless actions, deprivation of all civil rights, and the implementation of terror? These facts cannot even be concealed by the notorious so-called United Nations Commission on Korea, which has tried its best to defend the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique. Moreover, even this commission has had to acknowledge such facts. This commission admitted that in 1949 alone, South Korea arrested more than 100,000 Korean citizens, who were then subjected to severe torture, for the sole reason that these citizens, according to the rights stipulated in the constitution, criticized the government.

We all know these facts, which prove that the Syngman Rhee reactionary group, with the support of the American authorities and the American ruling group, implemented terror and persecution against progressive democratic organizations and democrats, attempting to suppress the Korean people's yearning for freedom and democracy, as well as their desire for Korean unification and national independence.

The extent to which the South Korean people hate the Syngman Rhee regime can be seen from such well-known facts: such as in November of this year, for almost an entire month, many members of the Seoul National Assembly demanded the resignation of the Syngman Rhee cabinet. They made this request because the Syngman Rhee cabinet was to bear full responsibility for launching the war and for the loss of life and property in Korea.

Please see the Associated Press dispatch of November 3rd: "The National Assembly of the Republic of Korea today refused to approve the appointment of Syngman Rhee's Minister of Education, Paik Nak-chun, as Prime Minister. The vote was: 21 in favor, 100 against, and 2 abstentions...

"The opposition of several members of the National Assembly to the Syngman Rhee government was expressed not long ago in the form of a petition calling for the resignation of the entire cabinet. The petition strongly blamed the Syngman Rhee cabinet for the war and the loss of life and property."

We have already listed and cited many documents in the Political Committee proving that the Syngman Rhee group, while preparing for an armed attack on North Korea, brutally suppressed Korean patriots, and barbarously suppressed them in the face of the American military authorities. But the American authorities condoned these atrocities and did not do anything for the so-called "protection of the rights to freedom of small countries," which Mr. Austin and others in the US-British bloc are now clamoring about. At that time, we presented many facts proving that the Syngman Rhee group, with the assistance of the American military authorities, prepared for the attack on North Korea. I hope to remind and should also remind attention to these facts, even if it is only a brief reminder.

Please see Syngman Rhee's letter to American Professor Dr. Oliver on September 30, 1949. You all remember this fact. This letter fully exposed the plan of attacking North Korea that the Syngman Rhee government was busy with at that time. What happened to this letter later? Professor Oliver himself published a letter in the newspaper. From this letter of Professor Oliver himself, we can see that the content of the letter of September 30, 1949, which I have recounted, is, in Professor Oliver's words, "basically correct." He was only surprised how this letter fell into our hands. However, if we recall the circumstances I explained about how this letter fell into the hands of the North Korean government, we should not be surprised. It was seized by the North Korean army from the archives of the Syngman Rhee government and the Syngman Rhee General Staff in Seoul, along with other documents.

I have also cited other letters proving the preparations for the attack on North Korea. I am referring to the letters of South Korean envoy Cho Byung-ok in October 1949 and another letter in November 1949, and also the letter of South Korean Ambassador Chang Myon in June 1950, which were sent on the eve of the South Korean attack on North Korea. And there are many very definite documents that do not allow any doubt, these documents prove the fact of planned preparations for the attack and the subsequent South Korean attack on North Korea.

When these documents were announced, Mr. Austin and the entire American delegation maintained dead silence, and did not attempt to refute these facts in the slightest. It is extremely significant that in these letters, the Syngman Rhee elements did not conceal their criminal plan to, in the words of Syngman Rhee, drive the North Koreans into the mountains, where they would starve to death, and to establish a defense line along the Tumen and Yalu Rivers. This is exactly where MacArthur's troops appeared not long ago.

Five more facts prove the US and Rhee provoked the war
Refuting Austin's cries of distorting and fabricating facts

Our delegation and other delegations presented numerous facts to the Political Committee and the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly on this issue two months ago, and now I cannot and do not need to recount them one by one. What I am talking about now is only related to Mr. Austin's statement yesterday; at least, in addition to what I have already said, I hope to remind attention to the following five facts.

The first fact. On June 19, 1950, Dulles delivered a speech to the South Korean National Assembly. He agreed with the plan of armed attack on North Korea and stated that the United States was determined to give South Korea all necessary spiritual and material support. Dulles heard this here in the Political Committee, Dulles was silent, just like his colleagues, like all those who participated in the US-British conspiracy against peace and the security of the people of all countries.

The second fact. On June 20, 1950, five days before the attack on North Korea, it was this same Dulles who wrote a letter to Syngman Rhee saying, "I deeply feel the decisive role that your country may play in the great drama that is about to unfold." What kind of great drama was about to unfold? -- We all understand very well now. Dulles wrote this five days before the June 25th incident. Dulles heard this here, and all his friends, the members of the American delegation and the members of other countries' delegations who always support this delegation in everything, also heard this. They all remained silent. Why? Because they cannot refute these documents, cannot refute these facts.

The third fact. Former South Korean Minister of the Army, Kim Hyo-seok, stated that in January 1950, when General Roberts gave instructions to the ministers of the Syngman Rhee government, he said to him, "The plan for the Northern Expedition has already been decided. The time to start implementing it is not far away." In fact, there were still a few months at that time. Roberts also said: "Although we will start the attack, we must create a pretext so that there is a legitimate reason..." Everyone heard this here, including the American gentlemen who are most closely related to this matter, and their friends, the British gentlemen, who also seem to care about the truth of this matter. They all remained silent without refuting, they limited themselves to saying some general words, saying that all this is propaganda.

But can they answer such questions: Is this a fact, or is it not a fact? Is there such a letter, or is there no such letter? Did General Roberts make such a statement? Why is General Roberts silent? Why are the responsible officials of the American State Department silent? I believe that today, apart from relying on general words saying that this is propaganda, this is fabrication, etc., they will still be silent. But I say: These are letters that have been published. Please also state publicly that these letters are not in accordance with the actual situation. This was almost the eve of June 25th, the day the South Korean gang attacked North Korea.

The fourth fact. In January 1950, MacArthur's adviser, Sebald, assured Syngman Rhee that when the Northern Expedition began, the American fleet and aircraft based in Japan would fight on the side of the South Korean government. Why is Sebald silent, why does he not refute this fact? Why has this matter been over for two months, and no one has said a word to refute this significant fact, but now, on other occasions, they are again not talking about the facts but using general words to say that the attack was completely launched by North Korea, etc.?

The fifth fact. This is the strategic map, which was also found in the confidential archives of the Syngman Rhee government after the occupation of Seoul. I have described this map in detail. Naturally, this map can also be submitted to a certain review committee. This map printed the entire plan for the attack on North Korea, and the map showed the direction of the attack and the army numbers that were to carry out and had carried out this attack.

Please see, there are at least the above five facts, which I think are very important, that are worth noting, proving the groundlessness and falsity of those who have embarked on the path of falsifying facts, they have distorted the real causes of the Korean War and the real purpose of this war.

American troops have seriously violated the United Nations Charter
American troops rushed to the Chinese border threatening China's security

In the face of these facts, Mr. Austin, Mr. Younger, and their accomplices are stubbornly saying here that the American troops went to resist aggression. They also call the American troops the United Nations troops, although British Prime Minister Attlee has also publicly declared that it is the American troops who are fighting there, not the United Nations troops. Their colleagues sitting on the right here call these troops the United Nations troops. Some others who are accustomed to acting as their echo in all aspects repeat this title. These gentlemen arbitrarily say that these troops are resisting aggression. However, in reality, the facts prove exactly the opposite. The facts prove that it is the American troops themselves who violated the requirements of the basic principles of the United Nations Charter and helped the aggressors, and carried out this aggression under the cover of the name and flag of the United Nations. These gentlemen even dare to declare that they "take measures to alleviate the suffering of the Korean people."

But, if it was not the American ruling clique that organized armed intervention in Korea and plunged this small country into dire straits, then who are the real criminals who caused these sufferings? Is it not enough to prove the hypocrisy of this so-called alleviation of the suffering of the Korean people by the barbaric bombing of American troops, which destroyed cities and villages?

The proponents of the "Six-Nation Proposal" are now enthusiastically talking here about the nonsense of "Communist troops," as if they attacked the American troops, as if they hindered the "restoration of the Korean people's sovereignty and control over their own territory, free from foreign control and rule." It is really surprising to hear such a statement from the American representative. He suddenly ignited the passion of sovereignty. And everyone knows that this delegation, supported by several other delegations, should be said fairly, still is and has been very emotionally shattering this sovereignty in all convenient and inconvenient occasions, shattering the very idea of national sovereignty. Now, they suddenly remember sovereignty, now they use the idea of sovereignty as a shield to say: Do you see, we have used our troops to defend this idea.

The American representative, the British representative, and several other representatives describe the Korean incident in such a way as if it is not the American troops who are urgently rushing to the Chinese border, but the so-called "Communist troops" of China who are pointing towards the American border. Here, the facts must be restored to their original state.

It must be reminded that the American government, long before the outbreak of the Korean War, had been and is still continuing to supply the Kuomintang clique with American aircraft and American bombs to bomb the cities and villages of the People's Republic of China. Later, American military aircraft began to directly bomb the cities and villages of the People's Republic of China on their own initiative. However, Austin did not mention this at all, as if it had nothing to do with the United States. But, you probably still remember that what Austin did not mention, Dulles had to admit when he was forced to the end on November 27th, Dulles confessed to the large number of facts of American military aircraft bombing the northeastern territory of China, and even marked all these bombings on a map. He had taken this map out here, and later it seemed that copies were distributed to the representatives. At least I have received such a copy, and I have carefully preserved it. However, Dulles also tried to justify these attacks by American aircraft, saying that they were reconnaissance in nature, and the bombing targets seemed to be only bridges spanning the Yalu River. I will reserve the right to question this statement, because we will study these issues later when discussing the next agenda item (i.e., the case of accusing the United States of aggression against China).

The Chinese people's aid to Korea is a legitimate and just action
The American ruling clique attempts to conduct unreasonable slander

But, is it necessary to specifically explain how the Chinese people, who have justly given proper evaluation to these actions, feel about all these "favors" from the United States? Austin did not mention at all such hostile actions of the American ruling clique against the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, such as the invasion of the Taiwan Strait by the US Seventh Fleet, the blockade of the Chinese coast, the seizure of Taiwan by the US fleet, and the use of the island as a military base and a bridgehead for preparing to attack China, etc. We will have the opportunity to explain these matters again when discussing the case of American aggression against China.

Austin also did not mention the fact that the American troops, after crossing the 38th parallel, moved north and threatened the northeastern border of China. Austin did not mention any of this. Romulo, who spoke here, and other representatives who supported the actions of the American interventionists did not mention this. However, it is precisely these facts that fully explain why the Chinese people, whose security is threatened by the American interventionists, are filled with righteous indignation.

All these gentlemen demand respect for and adherence to the United Nations Charter and its principles. At the same time, they even dare to threaten the Chinese people, as Younger said: Tell the Chinese people that if they do not fulfill these demands or "advise," the future will be ominous. But, if it is not they, not these gentlemen who pretend to be the maintainers of the principles of the United Nations Charter, then who are the violent destroyers of these principles, who are those who trample on these principles at every step on every important issue facing the United Nations? Those who destroy the Charter and its principles actually clamor that someone is destroying the Charter, unwilling to implement the illegal resolutions that the US-British bloc has forced the United Nations to accept, and even put forward such a proposal about the People's Republic of China.

However, the American ruling group's hostile policy towards the Chinese people should be enough to fully explain the movement against foreign intervention threats in China, which is participated in by the broadest masses of the Chinese people, who have risen to defend the borders of their motherland. This movement of the Chinese people is perfectly understandable and completely natural, especially when the troops of foreign interventionists occupy the territory of North Korea and move towards northeastern China, threatening many important areas within China.

Obviously, when the American ruling group declares that the entire Pacific Ocean is their own "vast moat," their own "shield," and insists that it must be used to ensure the security of the United States; when they extend their security line from the Aleutian Islands through the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the Philippines, all the way to the Mariana Islands -- as MacArthur said in his infamous letter to the Overseas Veterans Association -- the American ruling group is obviously taking this for granted.

At the same time, when the threat of aggression has approached the real rather than imaginary borders of China, they deny the Chinese people the right to take security measures against this imminent threat. Obviously, the position taken by the American delegation only proves an attempt: that is, to slander the completely legitimate and just actions of the Chinese people in any way; and the Chinese people have learned from the painful experience of their own history to recognize the plans to invade them, and to take self-defensive measures to defend their rights and interests.

If the American representatives could objectively consider the facts, then they would be able to understand why the Chinese People's Volunteers, who rose to defend the cause of justice, were able to carry out -- in the words of Austin here -- such large-scale, such complex, such serious battles. The American representative expressed surprise at the fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers are a well-organized, well-equipped army sufficient to engage in modern warfare. But there is nothing surprising here. In any war, volunteers are always organized, and they are equipped with the same modern weapons as the military formations they participate in. This is a completely understandable and regular phenomenon.

It is also not surprising that the volunteers can adopt military formations. There have been many such examples in history. It is inconceivable that the volunteers are just some kind of disorganized rabble. Of course, these will be military formations, disciplined formations, they obey the combat command and act in accordance with the common plan of the command, and they also act under the leadership of the command. We know that there are not few such examples in history.

General Dąbrowski, who led the Polish troops, participated in the street fighting of the Paris Commune, Kościuszko and Lafayette assisted the Americans in the war for independence, and the American detachment named after Lincoln and many other detachments of nations and countries fought for the Spanish Republic against the Franco fascist rule...

Austin and MacArthur fabricate materials full of contradictions
Even the American reactionary newspapers said "unbelievable"

One of the main pieces of evidence cited by the American delegation for slander is: "Only a nationwide effort can engage in such large-scale actions." But the mistake of the American delegation lies precisely here. They underestimated the truly nationwide effort made by the Chinese people in the struggle to win their independence and the unity of their motherland, and in defending this independence won from years of bloody struggle against the reactionary warlords and the American monopolists and colonialists who supported them. As excellently illustrated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of February 14, 1950, this nationwide effort, after 1945, caused a fundamental change in the situation in the Far East. It is precisely this situation that the proponents of the "Six-Nation Proposal" are obviously unwilling to pay attention to and obviously unwilling to take account of: the reactionary Kuomintang government has been overthrown, China has become a People’s Democratic republic, a new people's government has been established in China, this government unites the entire Chinese people, and in fact proves its ability to defend China's national independence and territorial integrity, and defend the national glory and dignity of the Chinese people.

Whoever does not understand the significance of these fundamental changes in Chinese actual life, whoever does not understand anything, whoever cannot understand the situation that is currently occurring in China due to the American interventionist army running rampant in Korea.

In order to support its slander against the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the American representative fabricated the numbers of the Chinese divisions fighting in Korea. Later, in order to specifically make this report suitable for the time when the Political Committee deliberated on the "Six-Nation" delegation's proposal, there was the so-called telegram from the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. Austin supplemented his statement by saying that he provided the Political Committee with "the most recent authoritative factual information on the Chinese Communists' interference."

However, what exactly is this so-called "information"? This is not "information" at all, but simply a list of troop numbers dictated by General MacArthur's headquarters, even without any review. It is possible to report five times more such simple lists of numbers, and with any facts that can be imagined, it is possible to most successfully and equally arbitrarily prove that fabricated fact.

This "information" was prepared for a special purpose. This can be seen from the original text of the telegram, the telegram says: -- I quote part of this telegram -- "The interrogated prisoners of war... are not volunteers in any sense of the word volunteers." Obviously, this sentence pointed out here -- these prisoners of war "are not volunteers in any sense of the word volunteers" is for a special purpose. It is to answer the request of the US-British group to their own Korean Committee, that is, to prove the American claim that there are no Chinese volunteers in Korea. Otherwise, why did this committee specifically write about volunteers, and write in such a way -- "are not volunteers in any sense of the word volunteers"? Obviously, this sentence was specially stipulated in advance to support the position of Mr. Austin, Mr. Younger, and other proponents of the US-British proposal.

The figures listed in the telegram are full of contradictions and are eye-catching everywhere. For example, the third and fourth points of the telegram are very strange. If we read this telegram carefully, then what do we see? The third point says that the total number of Chinese troops in Korea is 231,000 people; this is the total number! On the other hand, in the fourth point, that is, in the next line, it says: "There may be a larger number of troops in Korea" -- it does not say what kind of larger number of troops, and further says: "According to reliable sources, the total number of Chinese troops in Korea has reached 400,000 people." So let's study the situation! The total number on the line above is 231,000, and the total number on the line below becomes 400,000, the number has doubled. In addition, this is "possible," and at the same time it is based on "reliable sources," if the reported information is only "possible" and not actually so, then what kind of "reliable sources" are these? This is obviously a mess! Obviously, such information is not only not worthy of belief, but also not worthy of serious attention.

No wonder America's largest newspaper, *The New York Herald Tribune*, declared to the world on December 6th regarding the figures published by General MacArthur's headquarters (you have heard this here, and maybe you have also read): These figures are unbelievable. I will quote this report from *The New York Herald Tribune* line by line, word by word: "It is impossible to believe such figures, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to believe the military capabilities of the headquarters that often confuse facts with intelligence materials." In this case, someone suggests that we believe all the nonsense that the Korean Committee and the American delegation got from this headquarters. And this nonsense has already been exposed, according to newspapers like *The New York Herald Tribune* (there can be no doubt that it lacks American patriotism, chauvinism, and there can be no doubt that it has any sympathy for the Soviet delegation, but on the contrary, it is directly hostile to it), which has already been exposed. I only need to add one more point to the above situation, only one point. I only need to urge you to pay attention to the fact that in these days -- and precisely on December 2nd. The American command published a series of questions raised by reporters to General MacArthur and the answers to these questions. I will only give two questions from this large number of questions as examples -- the fifteenth question and the sixteenth question, and General MacArthur's answers to these questions. Please see, the fifteenth question: "How many prisoners do you have?" Answer: "About 145,000 people." The sixteenth question: "How many Chinese are among these prisoners?" Answer: "Less than 300 Chinese." Ratio: 145,000 prisoners versus 300 Chinese. How can this be consistent with the telegram of the Korean Committee and other general reports of MacArthur? How can this be reconciled? It is impossible to reconcile. This fact itself is very clear. It is precisely because of this that the Soviet delegation, and anyone who is objective and rational, cannot accept the information raised here by the representatives of the US-British group, these representatives try to cover up General MacArthur's confusion; I have criticized this confusion situation, and someone seems to want me to be legally responsible for this matter -- at least, American newspapers had such reports about me not long ago.

The US and Britain shout about abiding by the Charter but destroy it every day
Illegal resolutions have no binding force on China and the Soviet Union

In my first speech, I cited the Fifth and Thirteenth Regulations of The Hague. I talked about these regulations very precisely stipulating the rights and obligations of countries and individuals in land warfare or sea warfare. Neither the American representative nor the British representative have made any sound on this issue.

Someone reminded us to pay attention to what is required in Article 2, paragraph 2 of the Charter: All members shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the Charter. There is also what is required in paragraph 5 of that article: All members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes. Those who teach us the Charter tell us this. However, what I read in the Charter is, all actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.

However, I ask you, should we or others support the actions of a group of United Nations members that form a majority and call themselves the United Nations and pass illegal resolutions? Should we support them in these actions that do not conform to the provisions of the Charter?

Article 2, paragraph 5 stipulates exactly the opposite. Paragraph 5 says that we should give assistance to all actions taken in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. And when the Charter is violated, when the Charter is ridiculed, when the basic principles of the Charter are trampled on (please forgive me for being so straightforward), you have shown, you, the majority here, have shown that it is you who are thoroughly trampling on the basic principles of the Charter every day, in this case, the Charter does not stipulate what measures and actions to assist in.

Just look at the fact that the legitimate request to hear the speech of the North Korean representative was overthrown and rejected, are not the Security Council resolutions of June 25th and 27th and July 7th illegal resolutions? What kind of law do you think this is? Do you think this is in accordance with the Charter? Do you think this can be said to be in accordance with the provisions of Article 32 of the Charter? No, this is destroying the Charter! And you people who are systematically destroying the Charter are instead issuing hypocritical appeals here, calling out the Charter, calling out for adhering to the Charter, calling out for respecting the principles of the Charter. But it is you people who are destroying the Charter every day!

You have deprived the Security Council of the possibility of taking action in your own "United Action for Safeguarding Peace" case. Because you bypassed the Security Council, evaded the Security Council, and opened up new illegal paths. You formally abandoned the principle of unanimity of the great powers, because you thought it was convenient to achieve your goals in this way. You evaded the principle of unanimity of the great powers, created your own resolutions, and called them "United Action for Safeguarding Peace." In fact, this kind of resolution is precisely an attack on our bastion of cooperation, that is, destroying the principles of the United Nations! Then, you still say to us here: We must abide by the Charter. You are trying to use the Charter to cover up the illegal aggression against the people of Korea and China.

We should not demand respect for those resolutions of the United Nations that are obviously passed in violation of the Charter. But we must not destroy the Charter, we must respect this Charter, we must pass resolutions in accordance with the legal conditions and procedures stipulated by the Charter. But, until now, we do not have the representative of the great Chinese people of 475 million among us. Can it be considered that this is adhering to the Charter, rather than destroying it? It goes without saying that this is not possible.

The British representative, Younger, said: "You should take the Charter into consideration." But when demanding that others abide by the Charter, you must abide by the Charter yourself. And, we should not demand adherence to the illegal resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council at all. The Charter does not stipulate any obligation to support these illegal resolutions. What the Charter stipulates is: "All members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action taken by it in accordance with the provisions of the Charter." Therefore, illegal resolutions cannot and will never have any binding force on those who respect the Charter. The actions stipulated in the illegal resolutions of the Security Council are illegal. We have not recognized those actions in the past, we do not recognize them now and we will never recognize them as legal. Therefore, let those neurotics keep the various hints of threats about "ominous future" for themselves and their friends to enjoy! We are not such people.

The American representative, Austin, read out the original text of Truman's statement on supporting the Syngman Rhee army's attack on North Korea at the Security Council meeting on June 27th, and then the Security Council passed the resolution of the meeting on June 27th. Is this legal? Does this not mean that the United Nations -- in this case, the Security Council -- has lost its qualification as an international organization and is acting as a tool of American foreign policy, the policy of force?

Some representatives, because they could not find any logical arguments to oppose the volunteer forces movement that has been launched among the Chinese people to aid Korea, are desperately fabricating slanderous lies such as "Soviet imperialism." They are trying to divert attention from American imperialism in this way, and the clutches of American imperialism are well known to the Chinese people and have been repeatedly felt.

Romulo also attempts to defend American aggression
He forgot that his "country" is America's "cold dish"

The Philippine representative delivered a hypocritical speech here, saying that the United States had not -- in his words -- participated in plundering China, and has always protected the interests of the Chinese people. Romulo praised American imperialism. In his revelry, he even prostrated himself before American imperialism and kissed the hands and feet of American imperialism. However, Romulo, as an obedient role, had to admit that the United States -- in his gentle words -- "could not get rid of the temptation in the era of imperialist expansion!" How tactfully said! However, everyone knows what this temptation of imperialist expansion is.

The history of China, the history of South America, the history of the Pacific, the history of the Middle East and the Near East, and finally the history of the Philippines itself, have many examples of this terrible expansion; maybe someone will guess that I am out of some kind of partisan ideological considerations, then, in order to limit this statement to the minimum, in order to give this statement a basis, I cite the opinion of the famous British economist Professor Hobson, who wrote a book entitled *On Imperialism* in 1902. In that book, Hobson talked about American imperialism in a lot of space. I will now read some parts of this book written by Hobson.

We read in Hobson's book: "American big industrialists and big financiers, in order to pursue the possibility of maximum profits, will have to turn their eyes to China, the Pacific and South America, Cuba, the Philippines and Hawaii -- these are just "cold dishes" to stimulate the appetite, making them covet more abundant dishes."

This is what the late bourgeois economist Professor Hobson, who cannot be suspected of sympathizing with communism or sympathizing with socialism, wrote. Hobson also wrote: "When implementing imperialist measures, the state's expenditure is still a source of profit for those people, they are the people who raise loans for shipbuilders and shipowners as financiers and get subsidies from suppliers and manufacturers (they supply imperialism with arms and other equipment)."

Mr. Romulo, this is the purpose of American imperialism, which, as Your Excellency said, is tempted by imperialist expansion.

As for the United States' policy towards the Philippines in particular, the attempt to occupy the Philippines' production of coffee and cane sugar is the reason for annexing the country, is this not clear? This is what Romulo should also know and understand. Romulo mentioned what he called the United States' adventure in the Philippine Islands. However, he mentioned this in order to distort the facts and praise the American monopoly capitalists. He said that the United States' attitude towards the Philippines has not shown its imperialist intentions. Regarding this statement, I want to make a sentence that the French say in similar occasions: "Those in high positions should not be careless."

However, in fact, what else can the Philippine general serving the United States say in his current situation? He does not even dare to say that the Philippines obtained so-called independence from the United States under the agreement concluded in 1947 in exchange for war bases and other profits (Romulo said that the United States seems to have never received any profits from the Philippines) such generous benefits. He also talked about the beneficial impact of American imperialism on the Philippines. This "beneficial impact" of the United States is manifested in the notorious report of Bell, the former Undersecretary of the American Treasury, the chairman of the special committee responsible for investigating this "independent" country. What a price that was! -- A foreign committee to investigate this country, and the president of this country agreed to it! Look, that's what an independent country is!

Here is what Bell's report said: "The Filipino people hoped that with the arrival of peace and

    联合国大会政治委员会十二月九日会上
    维辛斯基痛斥美帝诽谤我国的“六国提案”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十三日电：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基十二月九日在联合国大会政治委员会上就美国的所谓“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”的诽谤案发表演说，全文如下：
    有些代表，首先是这个提案的提案国代表，在讨论时集中全力要把目前正在朝鲜进行的战事，说成是中华人民共和国军队与联合国军队之间的战事。这些代表竭力把事情说成似乎是所谓联合国军队——用美国代表在这里的话来说——保护“小国自由权利”、维护联合国的原则及其利益，并且说似乎是有人进攻了所谓在联合国保护下建立的政府，而他们则是予进攻以反击。
  美英竟认侵朝战争系为联合国作战
  他们颠倒黑白说谎勇气确令人惊异
    英国代表说，他们是为联合国的决议所阐明的目的而行动的，这些目的只限于击败侵略者，并建立自由、独立、统一的朝鲜。听到这些发言，不禁令人对这些代表说谎的勇气感到惊异，他们竟粗暴地颠倒黑白，颠倒显然无可争辩的事实。这些代表企图重提早已破产的所谓“北朝鲜侵略”的说法。可是有许多代表团，包括苏联代表团在内，曾提出大批文件，早就确定地把这种说法驳倒了。而现在，这种说法的唯一改变是：除去什么北朝鲜军队进攻南朝鲜傀儡“政府”这种谰言之外，朝鲜军事冒险的鼓励者和组织者又制造了新的谰言，说什么“中国共产军”进攻联合国军队，进攻联合国！
    美英代表都在这里说，他们的军队派到朝鲜去是为了联合国的宗旨，是为了支持集体抵抗侵略的原则。他们并引证由美英集团以及支持这个集团的若干政府代表组成的多数所通过的决议。可是，我们都知道，实际上美国、英国以及其他若干国家的派遣军队到朝鲜去，其目的不仅与联合国的原则及宗旨毫无共同之处，而且与联合国的宗旨直接相抵触。最可凭信而确实的证人——戳穿谎言而证实真相的文件和事实——就证明了这一点。这些文件和事实当时都曾在这里提交政治委员会审议过。这些文件和事实也曾向联合国大会全体会议提出过。这些文件和事实，过去是而且继续是令人信服而且有力的证明。那些人们，例如美英代表及其追随者们，在这些事实面前都已经哑口无言。可是，现在他们却又利用演说的天才，去引证早已被驳倒了的东西，竟好像这些东西还未被驳倒一样。
    当然，如果他们当时对我们所引证的那些事实提出反驳，那自然是合宜的。如果正当我们讨论朝鲜问题的时候，他们提出了说明所谓“北朝鲜侵略”的证据的话，那也是合宜的。但是当时他们却并没有这样做，这是完全可以了解的，因为他们根本没有事实，而且也不可能有事实，因为“北朝鲜侵略”这种说法根本是捏造出来的，而实际上侵略为南朝鲜所发动。这次侵略是南朝鲜傀儡军队在麦克阿瑟将军和美国政府的直接领导之下所发动和进行的。
    有人向我们说，美国、英国以及其他若干国家的军队的确是在朝鲜保护“小国的自由权利”。但是，我请问：在美国军事当局——这是那里事实上的当局——多年热心扶植的李承晚反动政权统治下，南朝鲜有什么自由可言呢？诸如无法无天的行动、剥夺一切公民权、厉行恐怖手段这些表现法西斯李承晚政权特色的令人愤慨的事实，难道我们都已遗忘了吗？这些事实甚至连想尽办法为李承晚反动派辩解的臭名远扬的所谓联合国朝鲜委员会也不能加以掩饰。而且，甚至这个委员会也不得不承认这种事实。这个委员会承认，在一九四九年一年之中南朝鲜就逮捕了十万人以上的朝鲜公民，逮捕后还要严刑拷打，其唯一的原因便是由于这些公民根据宪法所规定的权利批评了政府。
    我们大家都知道这些事实，它们证明了：李承晚反动集团在美国当局与美国统治集团支持下，对进步的民主组织和民主分子实施恐怖和迫害，企图以此压制朝鲜人民对于自由民主的渴望，以及他们要求朝鲜统一和祖国独立的渴望。
    南朝鲜人民对李承晚政权憎恨到了怎样的程度，可从这样一些人所共知的事实中看出来：如本年十一月，几乎整整一个月中，汉城国民议会许多议员都要求李承晚内阁总辞职。他们所以提出这种要求是因为李承晚内阁要对发动战争，要对朝鲜生命财产的损失负全部责任。
    请看美联社十一月三日的电讯：“大韩民国国民议会今天拒绝批准李承晚派教育部长白乐天为总理的任命。投票的结果是：赞成者二十一票，反对者一百票，弃权者两票……
    “国民议会中若干议员对于李承晚政府的反对，不久以前就以呼吁内阁总辞职的请愿书的形式表现出来了。请愿书中竭力要把战争和生命财产的损失归罪于李承晚内阁”。
    我们在政委会中已经列举和引证过许多文件，证明李承晚集团在准备武装进攻北朝鲜时，残酷地镇压朝鲜爱国志士，在美国军事当局面前对他们横暴地施行野蛮的镇压。但是美国当局却纵容这些暴行，而并不为奥斯汀先生以及美英集团其他人士现在所叫嚣的所谓“保护小国的自由权利”作一点事情。那时我们曾提出不少事实，证明李承晚集团在美国军事当局扶助下准备了对北朝鲜的进攻。我希望提醒也应该提醒注意这些事实，即使是最简短地提醒一下也是应该的。
    请看李承晚在一九四九年九月三十日给美国教授奥利伏博士的信吧。你们都记得这个事实的，这封信充分暴露了李承晚政府那时所忙于从事的进攻北朝鲜的计划。关于这封信后来发生了什么事情呢？奥利伏教授自己在报纸上发表一封信，从这位奥利伏自己的信中我们可以看出，我所复述的一九四九年九月三十日的信的内容，用奥利伏教授的话来说，“基本上是正确的”。他只是惊异这封信如何会落到我们手里，可是，如果回想一下我所说明过的这封信如何落到北朝鲜政府手里的情形，就不应该惊异了。它是和其他文件一起被北朝鲜军队从汉城李承晚政府和李承晚参谋本部的档案中缴获的。
    我还引证过其他的信件，证明了进攻北朝鲜的准备情形。我所指的是南朝鲜特使赵炳玉在一九四九年十月里的信和另外一封一九四九年十一月的信，而且还有南朝鲜大使张勉一九五○年六月的信，这些都是在南朝鲜进攻北朝鲜的前夕所寄出的信件。而且还有许多非常确实而不容任何怀疑的文件，这些文件证明了有计划地准备进攻的事实以及后来南朝鲜向北朝鲜进攻的情形。
    在公布这些文件时，奥斯汀先生以及整个美国代表团都保持死寂的缄默，而丝毫没有企图对这些事实进行反驳，这是极有意义的。在这些信件中李承晚分子并不隐讳自己的罪恶计划，用李承晚所写的话来说，要把北朝鲜人驱逐到山里去，使他们在那里活活饿死，要沿图们江和鸭绿江建立防线。这恰恰是在麦克阿瑟军团不久以前出现过的地方。
  再举五个事实证明美李挑起战争
  驳斥奥斯汀歪曲与伪造事实的叫嚣
    我们的代表团以及其他代表团两个月以前便已就这个问题向政治委员会和联合国大会全体会议提出了许许多多的事实，现在我不能而且也不必一一加以追述了。我现在所讲的，只是与昨天奥斯汀先生的声明有关的方面；至少，除我已说过了的而外，我希望再提醒注意下列五个事实。
    第一个事实。一九五○年六月十九日杜勒斯向南朝鲜国民议会发表演说。他赞同武装进攻北朝鲜的计划，并声称，美国决意予南朝鲜以一切必要的精神上和物质上的支持。杜勒斯是在这里政委会听到了这一点的，杜勒斯默然无言，正像他的同僚们一样，像所有参与美英反对和平与各国人民安全的阴谋的人们一样。
    第二个事实。一九五○年六月二十日，即进攻北朝鲜的前五天，也就是这位杜勒斯，他曾写信给李承晚说：“我深深感觉到你们的国家在即将演出的伟大戏剧中可能扮演的决定性的角色。”到底是什么样的伟大戏剧即将演出呢？——我们现在都已很明白了。杜勒斯在六月二十五日事件发生的前五天就写过了。杜勒斯是在这里听到了这一点的，所有他的朋友，美国代表团的团员和在一切方面都永远支持这个代表团的其他国家代表团团员也都听到了这一点的。他们都默不作声。为什么呢？因为他们无法反驳这些文件，无法反驳这些事实。
    第三个事实。前李承晚政府陆军部长金孝锡称，在一九五○年一月，罗伯茨将军在给李承晚政府的各部长以指示的时候曾对他说：“北征计划已是决定了的事。离开始实现它的时候，已没有多久了。”其实，那时还有几个月。罗伯茨又说：“虽然我们将开始进攻，但还须制造一个口实，以便有正当的理由……。”大家都在这里听到了这一点的，其中包括与这件事最有关系的美国老爷们以及也好像关心这件事的真假的他们的朋友英国老爷们。他们都默然无言地不加反驳，他们只限于说一些笼统的话，说什么这一切都是宣传。
    可是他们能不能回答这样的问题：这是事实，还是不是事实呢？有这样的信还是没有这样的信呢？罗伯茨将军有没有这样的声明呢？为什么罗伯茨将军默默无言呢？为什么美国国务院负责的官员默默无言呢？我相信，今天他们除了凭借笼统的词句说什么这是宣传，这是杜撰等等以外，仍将是默默无言的。而我却说：这是已经公布了的信件。请你们也当众声明这些信件是不符合实际的吧。这差不多是六月二十五日、即南朝鲜伙帮进攻北朝鲜之日的前夜的事情。
    第四个事实。在一九五○年一月，麦克阿瑟的顾问赛鲍尔曾向李承晚保证，在开始北征时，以日本为基地的美国舰队和飞机将站在南朝鲜政府方面作战。为什么赛鲍尔默不作声，为什么他不对这个事实有所反驳呢？为什么这事已过了两个月，而谁也不提只字来反驳这一具有重要意义的事实，而现在却在其他的场合再度不谈事实而以笼统的言辞说什么进攻完全是由北朝鲜发动云云呢？
    第五个事实。这是战略地图，也是在占领汉城后在李承晚政府的机密档案里发现的。我曾对这个地图加以详细的描述。自然，这个地图是也可以提交某种审查委员会的。这个地图印出了进攻北朝鲜的全盘计划，图上显示着进攻的方向和要实行并且已经实行了这种进攻的军队番号。
    请看，至少有我认为是十分重要的上列五个事实值得提起注意，证明那些已走上伪造事实的道路的人们的毫无根据与虚妄，他们歪曲了朝鲜战争发生的真正原因和这个战争的真正目的。
  美国军队严重地破坏了联合国宪章  
  美军向中国边境冲杀威胁中国安全
    在这些事实的面前，奥斯汀先生、杨格先生及其同伙们却在这里硬说美国军队是去抵抗侵略的。他们还把美国军队称为联合国军队，虽然英国首相艾德礼也曾公开宣称过，是美国军队在那里作战，而不是联合国军队。在这里坐在右边的他们那些同僚们，却把这些军队称为联合国军队。其他一些惯于在各方面充当他们的应声虫的人则重复着这种称呼。这些先生们武断地说，这些军队是抵抗侵略的。可是，实际上，事实证明恰恰是另一回事。事实证明正是美国军队本身破坏联合国宪章基本原则的要求而帮助了侵略者，并且在联合国名义和旗帜的掩护下进行这种侵略。这些先生们还竟敢宣称他们“采取措施以减轻朝鲜人民的苦难”呢。
    可是，如果组织武装干涉朝鲜和把这个小国陷于水深火热的不是美国统治集团，试问还有谁是造成这些苦难的真正罪犯呢？由于美国军队野蛮的轰炸，城乡遭到毁灭，难道这还不足以证明所谓减轻朝鲜人民苦难的这种说法之伪善吗？
    “六国”提案的提案人现在在这里热烈地谈论着什么关于“共产党军队”的无稽之谈，好像是它进攻了美国军队，好像是它阻碍了“恢复朝鲜人民的主权，以及对他们自己的领土的控制，不受外来的控制和统治”。听到出自美国代表的这样的声明，实在令人惊异。他忽然燃烧起主权的激情来了。而大家都知道，受到其他若干代表团支持的这个代表团，应该公正地说，仍然是而且一直是以非常激动的情绪在一切便利与不便利的场合粉碎着这种主权，粉碎着国家主权思想的本身。现在，他们忽然想起主权来了，现在他们以主权思想作盾牌来说：你们是否看见，我们已用自己的军队来保卫这种思想了。
    美国代表、英国代表、以及其他若干代表把朝鲜事件描写成这种样子，好像不是美国军队紧迫地向中国边境冲杀，而是中国的所谓“共产党军队”指向美国国境。在这里，事实必须恢复其本来面目。
    必须提醒大家注意这样的事实，例如，美国政府远在朝鲜战争爆发以前，就曾经而且现在还在继续以美国飞机和美国炸弹供给国民党集团，来轰炸中华人民共和国的城市和乡村。后来美国军用飞机又开始自行直接轰炸中华人民共和国的城市和乡村。然而奥斯汀却对此绝口不提，好像这与美国毫不相干似的。可是，你们大概还记得吧，奥斯汀所绝口不提的东西，杜勒斯在十一月二十七日被逼得走头无路时已不得不承认了，杜勒斯供认了美国军用飞机轰炸中国东北领土的大批事实，甚至还在一幅地图上标出了这一切的轰炸。这幅地图他曾在这里拿出来过，后来似乎并有副本分送各位代表。至少我已收到了这样的副本，我并且把它细心地保存了起来。可是，杜勒斯还企图为这些美国飞机的袭击辩解，他说这是侦察性质，而轰炸的目标好像只是横跨在鸭绿江上的桥梁。我且保留对这种说法质疑的权利，因为以后在讨论下一项议程（即控诉美国侵略中国案）时我们还要研究这些问题。
  中国人民援朝是合法而正义的行动  
  美国统治集团却妄图进行无理诽谤
    可是，已公正地对这些行动予以适当评价的中国人民，是怎样感受美国这一切“恩惠”，这难道还需要特别说明吗？奥斯汀绝口不提美国统治集团对中国人民和中国国家的这样一些敌对行动，诸如美国第七舰队入侵台湾海面，封锁中国海岸，美国舰队攫占台湾，并利用该岛作为军事基地和准备进攻中国的桥头堡等等。关于这些，我们在讨论关于美国侵略中国案时还有机会再加说明。
    奥斯汀也绝口不提美国军队在越过三八线后向北逼进而威胁中国东北国境的事实。对于这一切，奥斯汀都绝口不提。在这里发言的罗慕洛和在这里发言支持美国干涉者行动的其他代表都对此绝口不提。可是，正是这些事实完全说明了为什么其安全受到美国干涉者威胁的中国人民会义愤填膺。
    所有这些先生们都要求尊重和遵守联合国宪章及宪章的原则。同时他们都甚至敢于恐吓中国人民，例如杨格所说：告诉中国人民，如果他们不履行这些要求或“忠告”的话，前途就将凶多吉少。可是，如果不是他们，不是这些冒充联合国宪章原则之维护者的先生们，那末，到底谁是这些原则的横暴的破坏者，谁是对联合国面临的每一重要问题在每一步骤上都蹂躏这些原则的人们呢？这些破坏宪章及其原则的人们居然叫嚣说有人破坏宪章，不愿实行美英集团强使联合国接受的非法决议，并且竟提出了关于中华人民共和国的这样的提案。
    但是，美国统治集团敌视中国人民的政策，应该足以完全说明了中国国内人民反对外国干涉威胁的运动，这一运动有中国最广泛的人民群众参加，他们已经奋起保卫自己祖国的边疆。中国人民的这一运动，是十分可以理解而且是十分自然的，特别是当外国干涉者的军队占据了北朝鲜领土并向中国东北移动，威胁着中国境内许多重要的地区时，尤其是如此。
    显然地，当美国统治集团宣称整个太平洋是他们自己的“广阔壕堑”，是他们自己的“护身盾牌”，并硬说必须用它来保障美国的安全时；当他们把他们的安全线从阿留申群岛经琉球、台湾、菲律宾一直伸展到马里亚纳群岛——如麦克阿瑟在他那臭名远扬的致海外退伍军人协会的信中所说的那样——时，美国统治集团显然是把这当作是理所当然的事。
    而同时，当侵略的威胁已经迫近中国的真正的而不是假想的边界的时候，他们却又否认中国人民对已经临头的这种威胁有采取安全措施的权利。显然，美国代表团所采取的这种立场，只是证明了这样的一个企图：即无论如何都要诽谤中国人民的完全合法而正义的行动；而中国人民从自己历史的痛苦经验中却已学会了认识侵略他们的计划，并采取自卫的防御措施，来保卫自己的权利和利益。
    如果美国的代表们能够客观地考虑事实的话，那么他们就能够了解，为什么奋起捍卫正义事业的中国人民志愿军能够进行——用奥斯汀在这里所说的话来说——那样大规模的、那样复杂的、那样严重的战斗了。美国代表曾对中国人民志愿军是组织良好、装备齐全、足以从事现代战争的军队这一事实表示惊异。可是这里丝毫也没有值得惊异的地方。在任何战争中，志愿军总是有组织的，都是配有与他们所参加的军事编制同样的现代武器的军队。这是完全可以理解而且合乎规律的现象。
    志愿军可以采用军事编制，这也丝毫不足为奇。历史上有过不少这样的例子。如果说志愿军只是某种无组织的乌合之众，那是不可思议的。当然，这将是军事编队，有纪律的编队，他们服从作战指挥部并依照指挥部的共同计划行动，他们也在指挥部的领导下行动。我们知道历史上这样的例子是并不少的。
    率领波兰人部队的顿布罗夫斯基将军便曾参加过巴黎公社的巷战，哥斯邱科与拉斐德曾协助美国人进行过争取独立的战争，以林肯为名的美国支队以及其他许多民族与国家的支队也曾为西班牙共和国作过反佛朗哥法西斯统治的战斗……
  奥斯汀麦克阿瑟捏造材料矛盾百出  
  连美国的反动报纸都说“不能置信”
    美国代表团为了诽谤而引证的主要证据之一，就是：“只有全国性的巨大努力才可能从事这样大规模的行动”。可是美国代表团的错误也正就在这里。他们低估了中国人民在争取自己的独立和祖国的统一的斗争中，以及在保卫从多年反对反动军阀们及支持他们的美国垄断资本家和殖民者们的流血斗争中所赢得的这种独立时所作的那种真正全国性努力的宠大规模。如一九五○年二月十四日的中苏条约中所卓越地说明了的那样，这种全国性努力在一九四五年以后，引起了远东形势的根本变化，“六国”提案的提案人显然不愿注意的以及显然不愿顾及的正是这种情况：反动的国民党政府已被推翻，中国已变为人民民主共和国，在中国已成立了新的人民的政府，这个政府团结了全中国人民，并在事实上证明了自己有能力保卫中国的国家独立和领土完整，保卫中国人民的民族光荣和尊严。
    谁不了解中国实际生活中这些根本变化的意义，谁就什么都不了解，谁就也不能了解由于美国干涉军在朝鲜横行，而目前在中国所发生的那种情况。
    美国代表为了支持其对于中华人民共和国中央人民政府的诽谤，捏造了在朝鲜作战的中国师的番号。后来，为了特地要使这个报告适合于政治委员会审议“六国”代表团提案的时间，乃有了所谓联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的电报。奥斯汀给自己的声明加以补充说，他给政治委员会提供“关于中国共产党人干涉行为的最近的权威的事实资料”。
    然而，试问这个所谓“资料”究竟是些什么呢？这丝毫也不是“资料”，而简直是麦克阿瑟将军总部所口授的，甚至未经任何审查的单纯的部队番号表。可以再报出五倍多的这样单纯的番号表，而且用只要想像得出的任何事实，都可以最成功地并同样最武断地证明那虚构的事。
    这些“资料”是按照特别目的而准备好的。这从电报的原文就可以看出来了，电报说：——我引用这封电报的一部分——“被讯问的战俘……无论就志愿军这一语的任何意义来讲，都不是志愿军”。显然，这里所指出的这个句子——这些战俘“无论就志愿军这一语的任何意义来讲都不是志愿军”，是有特殊的目的的。它是要答复美英集团向他们自己的朝鲜委员会提出的要求，即证明美国的所谓在朝鲜没有任何中国志愿军的说法。不然，为什么这个委员会却特地写到志愿军，而且是以这样的方式——“就志愿军这一语的任何意义来讲都不是志愿军”来写呢？显然，这个句子是为了支持奥斯汀先生、杨格先生、以及其他美英提案提案人的立场，而特别预先规定了的。
    电报里所列举的数字矛盾百出，触目皆是。例如，电报第三点和第四点，就很奇怪。如果仔细阅读这个电文，那么我们就看到了什么呢？第三点说，中国在朝鲜的军队总数达二十三万一千人；这是总数！另一方面，在第四点里，即在下一行却说道：“可能在朝鲜有更大量的军队”——没有说出怎样的更大量的军队，而进一步又说：“据可靠方面情报，在朝鲜的中国军队总数已达四十万人”。那么我们来研究一下事情的状况吧！一行上面的总数是二十三万一千，恰恰下一行的总数却成了四十万，数字增大了一倍。此外，这是“可能”，而且恰在同时又是根据“可靠方面”，如果所报告的情报仅仅是“可能”，而不是在实际上如此，那么这究竟是怎样的“可靠方面”呢？这显然是混乱一团！显然，这样的资料不仅不值得置信，而且也不值得认真的予以任何注意。
    无怪乎美国最大的报纸《纽约先驱论坛报》十二月六日就麦克阿瑟将军总部所发表的数字向全世界声明说（你们在这里也听到过，也许你们也阅读过）：这些数字是不能置信的。我姑且逐行逐字地引用《纽约先驱论坛报》上的这一报道：“要相信这样的数字是不可能的，而且越来越难以相信经常是混淆事实与情报材料的总部的军事能力了。”在这种情况下，有人却建议我们相信朝鲜委员会及美国代表团从这个总部得来的一切胡言乱语。而这种胡言乱语就是按照《纽约先驱论坛报》（绝不能怀疑它会缺少美国爱国心、沙文主义，并且也绝不能怀疑它会对苏联代表团有任何同情，而相反地是与其直接相敌对的）之类的报纸所承认的，也已经暴露出来了。我只要对上述情形再补充一点，唯一的一点。我只要促请你们注意，就是在这些日子——而且正就是十二月二日。美国司令部发表了各记者向麦克阿瑟将军提出的一系列问题以及对这些问题的答复。我只举出这一大批问题中的两个问题作例子——第十五个问题和第十六个问题，以及麦克阿瑟将军对这些问题的答复。请看，第十五个问题：“贵处有多少俘虏？”答：“十四万五千人左右”。第十六个问题：“这些俘虏中中国人占多少？”答：“中国人不到三百人”。比率：十四万五千俘虏比三百个中国人。这与朝鲜委员会的电报以及其他麦克阿瑟的一般报告中所说的情形怎么能够相符合呢？这怎么合得拢来呢？不可能合得拢的。这个事实本身就是很清楚的。正因为如此，所以苏联代表团、以及无论那一个只要是客观而有理性的人都不能接受美英集团代表们在这里所提起的那些资料，这些代表们力图掩盖麦克阿瑟将军的混乱；我已经批评了这个混乱情形，而且有人好像要我对这件事负法律上的责任——至少，美国报纸曾在不久以前有过关于我的这样的报道。
  美英口喊遵守宪章却每天都破坏它  
  非法决议对中苏两国决无约束力
    我在第一次演说中曾引证过海牙第五项和第十三项规约。我曾谈到这些规约十分确切地规定了陆战或海战中国家与个人的权利与义务。无论是美国代表也好，英国代表也好，都没有对这个问题发出任何的声音。
    有人提醒我们注意宪章第二条第二款所要求的：各会员国应一秉善意，履行其依本宪章所担负之义务。还有该条第五款所要求的：各会员国对于联合国的一切行动，应尽力予以协助。那些教导我们以宪章的人就是这样告诉我们的。可是，我在宪章上读到的却是，依照本宪章规定而采取之一切行动。
    然而，我请问你们，不论我们或其他的人难道应该支持结成多数并自称为联合国和通过非法决议的一群联合国会员国的行动吗？我们是否应该在这些不符合宪章规定的行动上支持他们呢？
    第二条第五款所规定的恰与此相反。第五款说，我们应该对依照宪章规定而采取的一切行动予以协助。而当宪章遭到破坏，当宪章被人嘲弄，当宪章的基本原则遭受蹂躏的时候（请原谅我这样直率），你们显示了，你们多数方面在这里显示了，正是你们每天在彻头彻尾地蹂躏着宪章的基本原则，在这种时候，宪章就没有规定以怎样的措施和行动来进行协助了。
    只要看一看听取北朝鲜代表发言的合法要求竟被推翻、被否决的事实，难道六月二十五日和二十七日以及七月七日的安理会决议不是非法的决议么？你们认为这是什么法律呢？你们认为这是符合于宪章的么？你们认为这可以说是符合于宪章第三十二条的规定的么？不，这是破坏宪章！而有系统地破坏着宪章的你们这些人反而在这里发出了虚伪的呼吁，叫喊宪章，叫喊遵守宪章，叫喊尊重宪章原则。但是，正是你们这些人每天都在破坏着宪章！
    你们在你们自己的“保障和平的联合行动”案中剥夺了安理会采取行动的可能。因为你们撇开安理会，规避安理会，而开辟了新的非法道路。你们正式放弃了大国一致原则，因为你们认为这样便利于达到你们的目的。你们规避大国一致原则，制造自己的决议，并称之为“保障和平的联合行动”。实际上，这种决议正是对我们合作的堡垒的进攻，也就是在毁灭联合国的原则！然后，你们还在这里对我们说：必须遵守宪章。你们是企图用宪章来掩饰对朝鲜和中国人民非法的侵略行动。
    不应该要求尊重联合国那些显系破坏宪章而通过的决议。而必须不破坏宪章，必须尊重这个宪章，必须遵守宪章所规定的那些合法条件和程序来通过决议。但是，直到现在为止，我们之中还没有伟大的中国四亿七千五百万人民的代表。难道可以认为这是遵守、而不是破坏宪章么？不言而喻，这是不行的。
    英国代表杨格曾说：“你们应该顾及宪章。”可是在要求别人遵守宪章时，必须自己遵守宪章。而且，根本不应该要求遵守联合国大会和安理会的非法决议。宪章没有规定任何义务来支持这些非法决议。宪章上规定的是：“各会员国对于联合国依本宪章的规定而采取之行动，应尽力予以协助。”所以，非法决议对于尊重宪章的那些人，不能有并且永远也不会有任何约束力。在安理会的非法决议中所规定的行动，是非法的。我们过去不曾承认那些行动，我们现在不承认而且永远也不会承认那些行动是合法的。因此，让那些神经衰弱者保留着关于“凶恶的前途”的威胁的各种暗示，给他们自己和他们的朋友去享用吧！我们却不是这种人。
    美国代表奥斯汀六月二十七日在安理会会议上宣读了杜鲁门关于支持李承晚军队进攻北朝鲜的声明原文，然后安理会就通过了该会六月二十七日的决议。难道这是合法的么？难道这不是说，联合国——在这个场合中就是安理会——已经丧失了它自己那国际组织的资格，而充当美国外交政策、武力政策的工具了么？
    某些代表由于未能寻出任何合于逻辑的论据，来反对像中国人民中间所开展的援助朝鲜的志愿部队运动，因此就拼命捏造“苏维埃帝国主义”之类的诽谤谰言。他们企图这样来转移对美国帝国主义的注意力，而美国帝国主义的魔掌却是中国人民所深知，而且曾经屡次感受到的。
  罗慕洛还妄图为美国侵略行动辩护
  他忘了他的“国家”是美国的“冷盘”
    菲律宾代表在这里发表了虚伪的演说，把美国说成好像不曾——用他的话来说——参与掠夺中国的事情，而且一向保护着中国人民的利益。罗慕洛盛赞美国帝国主义。他在狂欢之中竟拜倒在美国帝国主义面前，吻着美帝国主义的手脚了。可是，作为百依百顺的角色的罗慕洛却不得不承认：美国——用他那温和的说法——“在帝国主义的扩张的时代，是不能摆脱诱惑的！”说得多么圆滑呀！然而，大家知道，这种帝国主义扩张的诱惑是什么。
    中国的历史、南美的历史、太平洋的历史、中东与近东的历史、最后菲律宾本国的历史上，有很多这种令人可怖的扩张实例；也许有人要猜想，我是出于某种党派思想的考虑，那末，为了把这种说法限制到最低限度、为了给这种说法以基础，我引证有名的英国经济学家霍柏森教授的意见，他在一九○二年写过一本以《论帝国主义》为题的书。在那本书中，霍柏森以不少篇幅谈到美国帝国主义。我现在来读一读霍柏森所著的这本书中的若干部分。
    我们在霍柏森书中读到：“美国的大工业家与大金融家，为了追求最大的利润的可能性，将不得不把他们的眼光转向中国、太平洋与南美、古巴、菲律宾与夏威夷——这些仅仅是促进食欲的“冷盘”，使其垂涎更丰盛的菜肴而已。”
    这就是怎么样也不能怀疑他同情共产主义或者同情社会主义的已故资产阶级经济学家霍柏森教授所写的。霍柏森又写道：“在实行帝国主义的措施时，国家的支出还是那些人们获取利润的一个源泉，他们就是以金融家身份出现的为造船商与船主筹集贷款的并且从供给者与制造商（他们以军火及其他装备供给帝国主义）那里取得津贴的人。”
    罗慕洛先生，这就是如阁下所说的受到帝国主义扩张的诱惑的美国帝国主义的目的。
    至于特别是美国对菲律宾的政策，企图占有菲律宾出产的咖啡与蔗糖乃是吞并该国的原因，这难道还不明白吗？这一点就是罗慕洛也应该知道而且了解的。罗慕洛曾提到如他所说的美国对菲律宾群岛的冒险。但是，他提到这一点乃是为了歪曲事实与颂扬美国垄断资本家。他说，美国对菲律宾的态度并没有表现过它的帝国主义企图。对于这种说法，我要提出法国人类似的场合下所说的一句话：“居高位者不可轻率”。
    然而，实际上，为美国服务的菲律宾将军在他目前所处的情况中能说些别的什么吗？他甚至都不敢说，根据一九四七年以战争基地及其他利润（罗慕洛说，美国似乎从来没有得到菲律宾的什么利润）这样优厚利益为交换而缔结的协定，菲律宾从美国的手中取得了所谓独立。他同时又谈到美国帝国主义对菲律宾的有利影响。美国的这种“有利的影响”在前任美国财政部副部长、负责调查这个“独立”国家的特别委员会主席贝尔的臭名昭著的报告中表现出来了。那一件事要有怎样的代价呀！——一个外国的委员会来调查这个国家，而且这个国家的总统还同意了呢！看吧，竟是这样的独立国家！
    这里是贝尔的报告中所说的话：“菲律宾人民希望，随着和平与独立的到来，他们可以达到经济的发展与生活水平的提高，可是，这种希望未能实现。”贝尔说：“鉴于经济状况的恶化，菲律宾人民现在普遍感到绝望。”“有一大部分农业与工业工人不相信他们的经济状况现在或者将来会有所改善。实业家担心比索（按为菲币）的破产。”该报告继续称：“政府人员大都庸碌无能，甚至贪污腐化。农业方面与商业界的领导人员没有充分履行其职责，来改善许多收入微少的居民的经济情况。”这就是在贝尔关于调查所谓美国帝国主义赐予的菲律宾状况的结果的报告中可以读到的东西。别的不说了，美国就是这样的恩人！
  “六国提案”目的在掩饰美国侵略
  苏联提案才真正有助于巩固和平
    我要结束我的话了。苏联代表团已经陈述了许多理由，证明“六国”提案是完全没有根据的，而且是不能成立的。该提案所追求的唯一的目的是：用一切冠冕堂皇的词句与引证——什么联合国宪章呀，它的崇高的原则呀，反侵略的斗争呀，集体制止侵略呀，总而言之，用各种各样的方法，来掩饰美国统治集团所强加于朝鲜人民的战争的真正的计划与目的，并盗用联合国名义掩盖美国对朝鲜人民的武装进攻。苏联代表团将投票反对这样的提案。
    苏联代表团认为必须接受苏联的提案。我们提议接受下列苏联提案：“大会鉴于美国的军队及参与干涉朝鲜的其他国家的军队在朝鲜继续进行的干涉对于和平与各民族的安全所造成的严重威胁，并为求得朝鲜问题的和平解决与远东和平及安全的建立，兹建议：（一）一切外国军队立即撤出朝鲜；（二）让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题。”
    我们认为，这是真正有助于巩固和平，并结束由美国及参与干涉的若干其他国家的军队盗用联合国名义而进行的那种令人愤慨的干涉行动的唯一正确办法。
