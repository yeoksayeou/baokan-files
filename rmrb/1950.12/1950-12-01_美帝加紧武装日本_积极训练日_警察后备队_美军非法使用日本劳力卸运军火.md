Xinhua News Agency, 27th. US occupiers are actively training the so-called "Police Reserve Force," the core of Japan's new army. According to a United Press report: a member of the "Police Reserve Force" in Tsutsujigaoka, Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture, said that the "Reserve Force" stationed in Miyagi Prefecture has a total of 13,000 members. Among them, former soldiers were sent to the former Japanese Naval Academy in Etajima, near Hiroshima, to receive special foreign-style typical training. These people are organized into mechanized units, flight squadrons, infantry units, and military police units, and receive training separately.

In Maizuru City, 4,000 members of the "Police Reserve Force" held a parade. They shamelessly shouted English commands in public, which aroused the anger of the workers on the roadside.

Xinhua News Agency report: In the war of aggression against Korea, in addition to illegally using Japanese troops to participate in the war, US imperialism also illegally uses Japanese labor to serve its aggressive war. According to an Associated Press report from Hungnam on the 24th: 1,100 Japanese people are at the Hungnam port on the northeast coast of Korea "unloading US military supplies." These Japanese were brought to the area by the so-called "United Nations forces" with "twice the wages in Japan" and "bonuses," "adopting a twelve-hour shift system" to unload ammunition and other military supplies for the US military. Due to the Korean people's resentment against the US aggressors for using Japanese accomplices, the report also said that the US military has "tried to isolate these Japanese from the Koreans who have historically been anti-Japanese." These Japanese now have to "live on a ship."

    美军非法使用日本劳力卸运军火
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国占领者积极训练日本新陆军核心的所谓“警察后备队”。据联合通讯社讯：宫城县仙台市榴冈地方的“警察后备队”队员谈称：驻扎在宫城县的“后备队”共有队员一万三千名，其中旧军人都被送到广岛附近江田岛的前日本海军学校，受特别的外国式典型训练。这些人编为机械化部队、飞行队、步兵队、宪兵队，分别受训。
    在舞鹤市，曾有四千名“警察后备队”举行游行。他们恬不知耻地公然喊叫英语号令，曾引起路旁工人的愤怒。
    【新华社讯】美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的战争中，除了非法使用日军参加作战外，并非法使用日本劳力，替其侵路战争服务。据美联社兴南二十四日讯：一千一百名日本人在朝鲜东北海岸的兴南港口“卸运美国的军事物资”。这些日本人是以“比在日本多一倍的工资”和“赏金”被所谓“联合国军”带到该地，“采取十二小时的轮班制”，为美军卸运弹药和其他军事物资。由于朝鲜人民对美国侵略者利用日本帮凶分子的愤恨，该电又说：美军已“设法使这些日本人和历来反日的朝鲜人隔离开来”。这些日本人现在只得“住在一条船上”。
