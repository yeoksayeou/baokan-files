Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: On December 14, 1950, the United Nations General Assembly illegally passed the thirteen-nation proposal regarding a so-called armistice in Korea. The proposal stipulates the establishment of a tripartite committee consisting of the President of the current UN General Assembly, Entezam, and the representatives he designated from India, Rau, and Canada, Pearson, to discuss and determine whether it is possible to prepare appropriate and satisfactory conditions for an armistice in Korea, and then submit recommendations to the General Assembly. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has issued the following statement regarding this matter:

I. The representative of the People's Republic of China neither participated in the discussion nor expressed agreement with the resolution of the so-called "Korean Armistice Tripartite Committee" passed by the United Nations General Assembly. Prior to this, our government has repeatedly stated that all major resolutions of the United Nations passed without the participation and consent of the legitimate representative of the People's Republic of China, especially major resolutions related to Asia, are considered illegal and invalid by the Central People's Government. Therefore, the Government of the People's Republic of China and its representatives are not prepared to have any contact with the aforementioned illegal "Tripartite Committee."

II. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently advocated, and still advocates, that the Korean War should be brought to a swift end. To end the Korean War, Korea must be able to restore genuine peace and the Korean people must be able to achieve genuine freedom to solve their own problems. The reason why the Korean War has not ended is due to the US government's dispatch of troops to invade Korea and its continued and expanded policy of aggression and war. As early as the beginning of the Korean War, we advocated the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue and the localization of the Korean issue. Therefore, the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet government repeatedly proposed that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and allow the Korean people to solve the Korean issue themselves. However, the US government not only rejected this proposal but also rejected negotiations on the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue. When the US invading forces arrogantly crossed the 38th parallel in early October, they blatantly disregarded any warnings and, following Syngman Rhee's cross-border provocation in June, completely destroyed and permanently erased this political and geographical boundary. In late November, when our representative was invited by the United Nations to participate in the Security Council's discussion on the case of accusing the United States of aggression against Taiwan, we also proposed that the United States and other foreign troops should withdraw from Korea and that the internal affairs of Korea should be resolved by the North and South Korean people themselves. However, the United Nations Security Council, under the manipulation of the United States, rejected this reasonable and peaceful proposal from our government. From this, it can be seen that the US government has refused to withdraw its troops from the beginning until now, so it has no sincerity in ending the Korean War and will certainly not allow the Korean people to achieve genuine peace and freedom.

III. Given this, why did US Representative Austin support an immediate ceasefire in Korea, and President Truman also express a willingness to hold negotiations to resolve the Korean War? It is not difficult to understand that when the US invading forces landed at Inchon Port, crossed the 38th parallel, or approached the Yalu River, they would not have supported an immediate ceasefire, nor would they have been willing to hold negotiations. Only today, when the US invading forces have failed, will they support an immediate ceasefire and hold negotiations after the ceasefire. Obviously, yesterday's opposition to peace was for the sake of the United States continuing to expand its aggression; today's support for a ceasefire is also for the sake of the United States gaining breathing space to prepare for another war, or at least maintaining its current aggressive position to prepare for a further advance. What they care about is not the interests of the Korean people, the Asian people, or the American people, but how US imperialism can retain its invading troops and aggressive actions in Korea, how it can continue to occupy China's Taiwan, and how it can step up war preparations in the capitalist world. Therefore, the representatives of MacArthur's headquarters simply stated that a ceasefire could only be accepted on a military basis and without any political conditions. This means that after the ceasefire, all aggressive conditions would remain the same, preparing to fight again, and using this opportunity to declare a state of emergency, preparing to implement mobilization in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, attempting to drive the American people, the Western European people, and the Japanese people into the abyss of war. Isn't that what Mr. Truman, Mr. Acheson, Mr. Marshall, and Mr. MacArthur are doing? The so-called ceasefire first, then negotiations, regardless of whether the twelve-nation proposal regarding the negotiation conference has been passed by the Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly, and regardless of which countries should participate in the negotiation conference, even if everything is agreed upon, the agenda and content of the negotiations can be discussed endlessly after the ceasefire. If the conference is not or does not belong to the legitimate Security Council or the legitimate Big Five conference, the US government still has its voting machine available for manipulation. Therefore, without the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the resolution of Korea's internal affairs by the Korean people themselves as the basis for discussing a ceasefire and negotiations, everything will be hypocritical, will suit the intentions of the US government, and will not be able to achieve the good wishes of the peace-loving people of the world. The tripartite group – on-the-spot ceasefire – peace talks – large-scale offensive. This Marshall formula is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people, because in 1946, General Marshall helped Chiang Kai-shek carry it out repeatedly for a year, and finally declared failure and left. The Chinese people were taught a lesson and achieved victory in 1946. Would they fall into this trap again today? No, General Marshall's old trick cannot be repeated in the United Nations.

IV. Moreover, the current problem is by no means limited to the Korean issue. While creating the Korean War, the US government sent the Seventh Fleet to invade China's Taiwan, then bombed Northeast China, shelled Chinese merchant ships, and expanded its aggression in East Asia. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has constantly lodged accusations with the United Nations for this reason. However, the majority of the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, not only supported the US aggression against Korea but also supported the US occupation of Taiwan, the bombing of the Northeast, and finally, rejected our representative's three proposals regarding the accusation of US armed aggression against Taiwan, and shelved the Soviet representative's proposal regarding the accusation of US aggression against China, leaving our representative waiting for a long time until the First Committee of the General Assembly adjourned indefinitely without having a chance to speak. This attitude of the majority of the United Nations under the manipulation of the US-British bloc is clearly contrary to the UN Charter and its purposes. They are not stopping but aiding US aggression, not defending but undermining world peace. What is particularly infuriating is that, despite countless discussions in the United Nations over the months on China or major issues related to China, the representative of the People's Republic of China, who alone can represent the 475 million Chinese people, is still being rejected at the door of the United Nations, while allowing the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek's small group of reactionary cliques to sit high on the Chinese representative seat in the United Nations, to what extent does this disregard and insult the Chinese people?! Therefore, driven by all kinds of righteous indignation, it is a matter of course and completely reasonable for the Chinese people to rise up and engage in voluntary actions to resist US aggression, aid Korea, defend their homes, and defend their country. The Chinese People's Volunteers are forced to take up arms and, together with the Korean People's Army, resist the US aggressors under the unified command of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, fighting for their own survival, fighting to aid Korea, and also fighting for peace in East Asia and for world peace.

V. It must be pointed out that the representatives of most of the thirteen Asian and Arab countries made proposals for the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue, originally out of a desire for peace, which is understandable. However, they failed to see through the full trickery of the US government in supporting ceasefire first and then negotiations, and therefore did not seriously consider the Chinese government's basic proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The thirteen-nation original proposal was not entirely pleasing to the US government and was split into two proposals. They were forced to prioritize the discussion of the first proposal that the US was satisfied with, namely the so-called "Korean Armistice Tripartite Committee" proposal, and thus it was passed in the United Nations General Assembly. The second proposal, namely the so-called "negotiation conference" or "negotiation committee" proposal, was not so satisfactory to the US, and was therefore temporarily shelved. The Philippine representative's performance highlighted the distinction between these two proposals. As the Philippine representative followed the US step by step, he could only agree to the first proposal and withdraw from the second proposal, thus exposing the farce of the Philippines demanding a ceasefire and the US supporting a ceasefire. A lesson can be learned from this event itself that if Asian and Arab countries want to achieve genuine peace, they must get rid of US pressure and abandon the idea of the "Korean Armistice Tripartite Committee" and ceasefire first and then negotiations.

VI. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China solemnly declares that the Chinese people urgently hope that the Korean War can be resolved peacefully. We insist that the negotiation basis for the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the resolution of Korea's internal affairs by the Korean people themselves. The US invading forces must withdraw from Taiwan, and the representative of the People's Republic of China must obtain a legitimate position in the United Nations. These points are not only the reasonable demands of the Chinese and Korean people but also the urgent desire of all progressive public opinion in the world. A peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and major issues in Asia is impossible without these points.

    关于联大非法通过成立“朝鲜停战三人委员会”决议
    我外交部周恩来部长发表声明
    我们坚持以一切外国军队撤出朝鲜及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决为和平调处朝鲜问题的谈判基础，美国侵略军必须退出台湾，我国代表必须取得联合国的合法地位。
    【新华社二十二日讯】一九五零年十二月十四日联合国大会非法通过了十三国关于在朝鲜所谓停战的提案，该案规定成立一个由联合国本届大会主席安迪让及经他指定的印度代表劳氏和加拿大代表皮尔逊所组成的三人委员会，进行商讨，以决定是否可能准备在朝鲜停战的适当的和满意的条件，然后向联大提出建议。我中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长特就此事发表声明如下：
    一、联合国大会通过的所谓“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的决议，中华人民共和国的代表既未参加讨论，亦未表示同意。在此以前，我国政府曾经多次声明，凡是没有中华人民共和国的合法代表参加和同意而被通过的联合国的一切重大决议，首先是有关亚洲的重大决议，中华人民共和国中央人民政府都认为是非法的，无效的。因此，中华人民共和国政府及其代表不准备与上述这个非法的“三人委员会”进行任何接触。
    二、中华人民共和国中央人民政府历来主张、现在仍然主张朝鲜战事应该迅速结束。结束朝鲜战事，必须使朝鲜能够恢复真正和平，使朝鲜人民能够得到真正自由来解决自己的问题，而朝鲜战事之所以不得结束，就是由于美国政府派兵侵略朝鲜，并继续和扩大其侵略政策和战争政策的结果。远在朝鲜战事初起，我们即主张和平调处朝鲜问题，并使朝鲜问题局部化，故中华人民共和国政府与苏联政府曾再三提议，一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题，但美国政府不但拒绝了这种提议，并且拒绝了关于和平调处朝鲜问题的谈判。等到十月初，美国侵略军趾高气扬地越过三八线的时候，更悍然不顾任何方面的警告，继着李承晚六月越境挑衅之后，彻底破坏了因而也就永远抹去了这一政治地理的界线。十一月下旬，我国代表被联合国邀请参加安全理事会关于控诉美国侵略台湾一案的讨论时，又曾提出美国及其他外国军队一律撤出朝鲜，朝鲜内政由南北朝鲜人民自己解决的主张，但联合国安全理事会在美国操纵之下拒绝了我国政府这个合理的和平的建议。由此可见，美国政府从开始到现在都拒绝撤兵，故它决无结束朝鲜战事的诚意，更不会让朝鲜人民得到真正的和平与自由。
    三、既然如此，为什么美国代表奥斯汀先生又赞成在朝鲜立即停战，而杜鲁门总统也表示愿意举行谈判以解决朝鲜战事呢？不难了解，当着美国侵略军登陆仁川港、越过三八线或直逼鸭绿江的时候，他们不会赞成立即停战，也不会愿意举行谈判；只有在美国侵略军失败的今天，他们才会赞成立即停战，并在停战后举行谈判。很显然地，昨天反对和平，是为着美国可以继续扩张侵略；今天赞成停战，也是为着美国可以取得喘息时间，准备再战，至少可以保持现有侵略阵地，准备再进。他们所关心的不是朝鲜人民、亚洲人民、也不是美国人民的利益，而是美帝国主义如何能在朝鲜保留侵略军队和侵略行动，如何能继续侵占中国的台湾，如何能在资本主义世界加紧战争准备。所以麦克阿瑟司令部的代表便干脆地说，唯有在军事基础上而无任何政治条件时，才可接受停战。这就是说，停战后一切侵略状态照旧，准备好了再打，并且还借此先宣布紧急状态存在，在美国、在西欧、在日本准备实行动员，企图将美国人民、西欧人民、日本人民驱入战争深渊。杜鲁门、艾奇逊、马歇尔、麦克阿瑟等先生们不就是在这样做么？所谓先停战后谈判，不管关于谈判会议的十二国提案尚未为安全理事会或联合国大会通过，也不管参加谈判会议的应包括那些国家，即使都商定了，而谈判的议程和内容也可在停战后无休止地讨论下去；如果会议不是或不属于合法的安全理事会或合法的五强会议，最后，美国政府还有它的表决机器可供操纵。因此，在没有一切外国军队撤出朝鲜及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决作基础，来讨论停战和谈判，都将是虚伪的，都将适合美国政府的意图，而不可能达到世界爱好和平人民的善良愿望。三人小组——就地停战——和平谈判——大举进攻。这一马歇尔公式对中国人民极不生疏，因为在一九四六年马歇尔将军曾经帮助蒋介石如此反复地进行了一年之久，最后始宣布失败而去。中国人民在一九四六年既受过教训，又得到胜利，难道在今天还会钻上这个圈套么？不会的，马歇尔将军的故技在联合国是不能重演的了。
    四、况且，目前问题又决不仅限于朝鲜问题。美国政府在制造朝鲜战事的同时，便派遣了第七舰队侵略中国的台湾，接着轰炸中国东北，炮击中国商船，并扩大在东亚的侵略。中华人民共和国中央人民政府为此曾不断地向联合国提出控诉，而联合国的多数在美国操纵之下不但支持了美国侵略朝鲜，并且也支持了美国侵占台湾，轰炸东北，最后，并拒绝了我国代表关于控诉美国武装侵略台湾的三项建议，搁置了苏联代表关于控诉美国侵略中国的提案，使我国代表等待许久直至联大第一委员会无限期休会时止仍没有得到发言机会。联合国的多数在美英集团操纵之下的这种态度，显然是违背联合国宪章和宗旨，他们不是制止而是助长美国侵略，不是保卫而是破坏世界和平。尤其使人愤慨的，尽管数月来，联合国无数次地在讨论中国或与中国有关的重大问题，但唯一能代表四亿七千五百万中国人民的中华人民共和国代表直到现在仍被拒绝在联合国大门之外，而听任蒋介石的一小撮反动集团的代表高踞在联合国的中国代表席上，其无视和污辱中国人民到何种程度？！因此，中国人民激于种种义愤，奋起从事于抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿行动，乃是天经地义、完全合理之举。中国人民志愿部队被迫拿起武器与朝鲜人民军一道在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府统一指挥之下抵抗美国侵略者，是为自己生存而战，为援助朝鲜而战，也是为东亚和平而战，为世界和平而战。
    五、必须指出：十三个亚洲及阿拉伯国家中的大多数国家代表提出和平调处朝鲜问题的建议，原本出于和平愿望，这是可以理解的，然而他们没有能够识破美国政府支持先停战后谈判的全部诡计，因而也就没有郑重考虑中国政府关于和平解决朝鲜问题的基本建议。十三国原先提案不完全为美国政府所喜，遂被分裂为两个提案，并被迫优先讨论美国所满意的第一个提案，亦即所谓“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的提案，因而也就在联合国大会得以通过；而第二个提案亦即所谓“谈判会议”或“谈判委员会”的提案，是美国不能或没有那样满意的，因而就被暂时搁置起来。在这两个提案的区别上，菲律宾代表表现得最为突出。以追随美国亦步亦趋的菲律宾代表，他只能同意第一个提案，而退出第二个提案，于是菲律宾要求停战、美国赞成停战的双簧为之戳穿。从这一事件本身就可得到一个教训，亚洲及阿拉伯国家要想谋取真正和平，必要摆脱美国的压力，必须抛弃“朝鲜停战三人委员会”及先停战后谈判的想法。
    六、中华人民共和国中央人民政府郑重声明：中国人民亟望朝鲜战事能得到和平解决。我们坚持以一切外国军队撤出朝鲜及朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决为和平调处朝鲜问题的谈判基础，美国侵略军必须退出台湾，中华人民共和国的代表必须取得联合国的合法地位；这几点不但是中国人民和朝鲜人民的合理要求，也是全世界一切进步舆论的迫切愿望。朝鲜问题和亚洲重要问题的和平解决，离开这几点是不可能的。
