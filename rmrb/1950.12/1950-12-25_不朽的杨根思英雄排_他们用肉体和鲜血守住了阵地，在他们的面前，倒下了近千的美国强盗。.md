    The Immortal Yang Gensi Hero Platoon
    They defended the position with their flesh and blood,
    And nearly a thousand American bandits fell before them.
    On the evening of November 27th, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army launched a campaign to divide and annihilate the entire US Marine Corps 1st Division and the bulk of the US Infantry 7th Division in the Changjin Lake area. The next day, a unit of the People's Volunteer Army captured Hill 1071, a commanding height outside Hagaru-ri south of Changjin Lake. The soldiers, from their high vantage point, could hit the scurrying enemy in Hagaru-ri with their rifles. The enemy, attempting to remove this dagger stuck in their throat, counterattacked desperately, and a fierce battle ensued here.
    Yang Gensi, the company commander of the 3rd Company, received the task of controlling the small Gaoling, the southeastern barrier of Hill 1071. The battalion commander's order was: "Do not allow the enemy to climb even an inch onto Hill 1071, and resolutely wipe out the enemy before the small Gaoling position!" Yang Gensi did not hesitate in the slightest; he personally led the 3rd Platoon to guard the small Gaoling. After deploying his forces and firepower, he said to all the comrades in the platoon: "Comrades, let's perform meritorious service in the just war against the American aggressors!"
    In order to eliminate the serious threat to Hagaru-ri, the American invading army launched successive counterattacks against the small Gaoling position. Initially, they used heavy artillery and aircraft to cover dispersed formations, climbing up one or two at a time. Yang Gensi resolutely said: "Let the enemy come up. When they reach forty or fifty meters, aim and fire with rifles, use machine guns for bursts, and resolutely wipe out the enemy completely!" Under the calm strikes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, not a single American bandit climbed up; instead, the first batch of corpses fell.
    The enemy's counterattacks continued, one after another, and the number of fallen corpses rapidly increased. Yang Gensi's platoon also gradually decreased in number due to heroic casualties. After repeated unsuccessful attacks, the enemy concentrated heavy artillery and B-29 heavy bombers, pouring explosive bombs, incendiary bombs, and even gasoline onto the top of this small hill. Steel, rocks, and flames flew everywhere. At this moment, the enemy launched a group charge from three sides. But the brave men of the heroic Yang Gensi platoon stood firm. The heroes calmly waited for the enemy to rush within thirty meters, then hurled a volley of grenades, followed by a burst of Tommy gun fire, and the dense enemy rolled down the mountain one after another. Dozens of enemy planes continued to take turns bombing in batches, and the artillery fire did not stop for a moment. They used tons of steel to deal with this platoon of men, but the heroes still encouraged each other: "Resolutely hold the position, and if an enemy comes up, we will wipe him out!"
    The battle became increasingly fierce, and only a few people were left in Yang Gensi's platoon, and the ammunition was running out. At this time, the enemy launched the ninth, and also the final, counterattack. In the billowing smoke, groups of enemies charged from the front. The heroes led by Yang Gensi threw all their grenades and fired the last batch of bullets at the enemy, and another batch of enemies fell. Nearly a thousand American bandits had fallen in front of the position.
    The heroic platoon of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army still held their position, and they would never surrender to the enemy, even if only one person was left to fight. The hero Yang Gensi accurately shot at the approaching enemy with his pistol. When he fired the last bullet, more than forty enemies had climbed close to the top of the hill. At this critical moment, Yang Gensi, a hero full of courage, for the sake of the motherland and to save the Korean people, grabbed a package of ten kilograms of explosives, lit the fuse, and rushed towards the enemy crowd. In a loud explosion, the hero Yang Gensi gloriously perished together with the evil enemy. The immortal heroes defended the Gaoling, the southeastern barrier of Hill 1071, with their own flesh and blood. The comrades on other positions launched a sweeping attack in the sound of the charge. Their chests burned with the anger of avenging the Chinese and Korean people and their close comrades-in-arms, and they marched victoriously forward, following in the footsteps of the immortal heroes.

    不朽的杨根思英雄排
    他们用肉体和鲜血守住了阵地，
    在他们的面前，倒下了近千的美国强盗。
    十一月二十七日晚，中国人民志愿军发起了对长津湖地区美海军陆战队第一师全部和美步兵第七师大部的分割围歼战。次日，人民志愿军某部攻占了长津湖以南下碣隅里外围的制高点一零七一高地。战士们居高临下，用步枪就可以打到下碣隅里蠢动的敌人。敌人妄图拔除这把刺入他们的咽喉的刺刀，拼死反扑，于是猛烈的争夺战就在这里展开了。
    三连连长杨根思领受了控制一零七一高地东南屏障小高岭的任务。营指挥员的命令是：“不许敌人爬上一零七一高地寸步，坚决把敌人消灭在小高岭阵地之前！”杨根思没有丝毫犹豫，他亲率第三排把守小高岭。他把兵力和火力布置好以后，对全排战友说：“同志们，在反抗美国侵略者的正义战争中立功吧！”
    美国侵略军为了排除对下碣隅里的严重威胁，对小高岭阵地，进行了轮番的反扑。开始是重炮、飞机掩护着疏散的队形，一个两个往上爬。杨根思坚毅地说：“让敌人上来，到四、五十米达时，步枪瞄准打，机枪点射，坚决把敌人歼灭干净！”美国强盗在中国人民志愿军这种沉着的打击下，没爬上来一个人，却倒下了第一批尸体。
    敌人的反扑持续着，一次接着一次，倒下的尸体迅速增加。杨根思的一排人也因英勇伤亡而逐渐减员。敌人多次反击无效，集中了重炮和Ｂ二十九型重轰炸机，将爆炸弹、烧夷弹，甚至汽油，都倒向这座小山顶。钢铁、石块、烟火满山飞扬。就在这时，敌人从三面发动了集团冲锋。但英雄杨根思排的勇士们坚强地站立着。英雄们沉着地等待敌人冲到三十米达时，就掷出一阵排子手榴弹，接着一阵汤姆枪扫射，密集的敌人就接连地滚下山去。数十架敌机依旧分批在轮番轰炸，炮击也未稍停，他们用成吨的钢铁来对付这一排人，但是英雄们仍然互相鼓励着：“坚决守住阵地，敌人上来一个，就消灭他一个！”
    战斗愈来愈激烈，杨根思的一个排已经只剩下几个人了，弹药也快打完。这时敌人发动了第九次，也是最后一次的反扑。在冲天浓烟中，成群的敌人从正面冲上来，杨根思率领的英雄们掷出所有的手榴弹，用最后的一批子弹射向敌人，敌人又倒下了一批。在阵地前，已倒下了近千个美国强盗。
    中国人民志愿军的英雄排依然坚守着自己的阵地，他们战斗到留下一个人，也决不向敌人屈服。英雄杨根思用驳壳枪准确地射击着逼近的敌人。当他打出最后一颗子弹时，四十多个敌人已经爬近山顶。在这危急的时刻，杨根思这个满身是胆的英雄，为了祖国，为了救助朝鲜人民，握起了一包十斤重的炸药，拉响了导火索，向敌群冲去。一声轰响中，英雄杨根思就壮烈地与万恶的敌人同归于尽。不朽的英雄们用自己的肉体和鲜血守住了一零七一高地东南屏障的高岭。其他阵地上的战友们在冲锋号中发起了排山倒海的攻击。他们的胸中燃烧着为中朝人民为自己的亲密战友复仇的怒火，他们踏着不朽英雄们的血迹胜利前进。
