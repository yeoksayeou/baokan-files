Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st: The "Pravda" and "Izvestia" newspapers published special articles on the 29th, celebrating the sixth anniversary of Albania's liberation. "Pravda" published a special article by Bratov, stating: Albania, liberated from the shackles of imperialism with the help of the Soviet Union, has greatly developed its national economy in the past six years. Mines, which were completely destroyed in the war, have been restored. Compared with 1945, oil production has increased fourfold, coal production has increased fivefold, textile production has increased sevenfold, and the output of the leather and shoemaking industries has increased seventeenfold. The Two-Year Plan is being successfully implemented. In agriculture, more than 70,000 poor peasant households have been allocated more than 170,000 hectares of land. Large-scale water conservancy and reclamation work is underway, and the scale of the agricultural cooperative movement is also expanding. Bratov pointed out that the construction achievements of the Albanian people have resolutely struck at the aggressive conspiracies of the American and British imperialists and their running dogs. The Albanian people have suffered all the horrors of war, so they are united in the struggle to defend peace, and 685,000 adults throughout Albania have signed the peace declaration.

Shafrov wrote an article in Izvestia stating that the Albanian people are demonstrating unprecedented strength and unity as they celebrate the sixth anniversary of the country's liberation. The elections for the People's Assembly held this spring show that the Albanian people unanimously support the Workers' Party's policy of consolidating and safeguarding national sovereignty and independence. The frantic provocations of the American and British imperialists and their running dogs—the Belgrade and Athens fascists—have failed, and the Albanian people are vigilantly guarding their territory.
