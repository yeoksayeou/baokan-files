Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Mutual recrimination and increasingly serious differences have become the hallmark of the relationship between the US and British imperialist powers after suffering repeated defeats on the Korean battlefield.

Although many US and British newspapers boasted that the Truman-Attlee talks were a "symbol of Western unity," with British newspapers claiming it as Attlee's victory and American newspapers saying Washington had persuaded London, just one day after the Truman-Attlee talks ended, a Reuters reporter reported from Washington: "American leaders, faced with major differences with the British government, have begun to formulate the direction of American foreign policy toward the Far East. The Truman-Attlee talks have ended, and the differences between the US and British governments remain unresolved. The US government cannot yield to the British view," and "the British government cannot yield to the American view."

During the Truman-Attlee talks, the New York Herald Tribune listed the contradictions between Britain and the United States. The newspaper described American accusations against Britain as follows: "(1) Britain has not done its utmost to rearm; (2) Some members of the British Labour Party oppose making financial sacrifices for high mobilization; (3) Britain is slow to move forward on the unification of Western Europe; (4) Britain has not sent sufficient troops to participate in the Korean War; (5) Most Britons are trying to seek peace by 'appeasing' the Soviet Union and China." The newspaper also described British dissatisfaction with the United States as follows: "(1) The United States is becoming increasingly deeply involved in military affairs in the remote corner of Korea, which may leave Western Europe 'undefended'; (2) The United States is dragging its allies into a devastating war; (3) Judging from the sensational remarks made by Truman at a press conference last week, the United States may start dropping atomic bombs without considering the terrible consequences that may arise; (4) The United States is not making sufficient active contact with the Soviet Union to seek ways to establish peace; (5) Crossing the 38th parallel in Korea was a serious mistake by General MacArthur, which forced China to 'intervene' in Korea; (6) The American public is fickle, so Britain doubts whether American foreign policy has any consistency."

British dissatisfaction with the United States has been boiling over since the end of November, after the Chinese People's Volunteers inflicted heavy blows on the US and British invading forces on the Korean battlefield. This dissatisfaction has spread from ordinary newspapers to certain officials. They vented their dissatisfaction on MacArthur. British Defense Minister Shinwell said on the 3rd: "At one point, MacArthur seemed to exceed the goals we understood at the beginning of the event, and as a result, we approached the Manchurian border with a large Chinese army stationed there. We knew that there were about 70,000 troops ready to fight there, and General MacArthur may have thought he could deal with them. However, there may have been more troops there, and his intelligence was wrong. Our situation is really terrible, and it is useless to deceive ourselves." According to United Press International, "Shinwell's remarks caused an uproar in British public opinion," and "it is generally believed that MacArthur's attempt to advance from the Manchurian border was a mistake."

On the same day that Shinwell made his remarks, Labour MPs Evans and Brockway also strongly criticized MacArthur in their speeches. Evans said that MacArthur was "a blunderer in real life," and "a bull in a china shop, as the saying goes." Evans said: "MacArthur has assigned himself the role of a new political savior who wants to eliminate communism in the world by force. But this will not work. ... Communism cannot be destroyed." "The people of Asia will not fight to maintain corrupt regimes like those of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek." A Conservative MP, Brigadier John Smyth, fully revealed the fear of British public opinion that the United States would drag it into a world war. He said: "For God's sake, let's not get involved in a war, because I believe we are in such danger. If another world war cannot be avoided, then for the United States, it will mean life will become extremely uncomfortable; for Britain, it will mean a path to a miserable death."

Washington responded to these British accusations and ideas of avoiding war. According to a Central News Agency report on the 11th, "American newspapers and magazines are still criticizing Attlee's reluctant joint statement with Truman on 'no appeasement.' Columnist Lawrence today lashed out at Britain for being shortsighted and daring not to face the reality of the Far East." Lawrence claimed: "The 'morality' and 'ideals' that American children are shedding blood for in Korea seem to no longer exist in British diplomacy." "When firmness and unity are extremely important, the joint statement immediately gives people a feeling of fear." Lawrence fiercely attacked Britain's "shortsighted policy," saying: "If a major ally stammers and cravenly begs for a negotiated peace in times of crisis, then the spiritual connection will have no real spiritual strength." The US Information Service, on the 17th, summarized a week of comments from American newspapers and magazines, revealing that these comments criticized "the horrified attitude of America's European allies and their cowardice and procrastination."

The London Times, which usually reflects official opinion, has repeatedly explained Britain's position. The newspaper pointed out that the differences between the United States and Britain "are about methods, not about goals." "Britain has never wanted to curry favor with Communist China, let alone 'appease Communist China.'" The newspaper admitted that Britain's attitude towards China "is purely based on the needs of the facts."

However, in any case, the complaints, dissatisfaction, and divisions that permeate the imperialist camp have shrouded Washington in pessimism. The Wall Street Journal, in its December 12th issue, revealed: "A survey conducted by the State Department at Lake Success and abroad revealed shocking news: if a war with China officially breaks out, with two exceptions, Latin American, Arab, and Western European countries will not support the United States." Newsweek admitted: "It will not be easy to get the British, French, and other governments to stop opposing America's Far East policy." "Our 'big stick policy' has tended to deepen the divisions between our country and its allies."

### 美英之间争吵日多  英报责备麦魔闯祸，美报骂英国短视

    美英之间争吵日多
    英报责备麦魔闯祸，美报骂英国短视
    【新华社二十一日讯】互相埋怨攻讦、以及日趋严重的歧见，已成为在朝鲜战场上迭遭惨败后美英两大帝国主义之间的关系的特色。
    尽管不少美英报纸吹嘘杜鲁门、艾德礼会谈是“西方团结的象征”，英国的报纸说这是艾德礼的胜利，美国的报纸则说华盛顿说服了伦敦，但是，就在杜艾会谈结束后一日，路透社记者即自华盛顿报道：“美国领袖在与英国政府之间的重大分歧面前，开始制订美国对远东外交政策的方针。杜艾会谈已结束，美英两国政府间的分歧仍悬而未决。美国政府不能向英国的观点让步”，同时“英国政府也不能对美国的观点让步”。
    在杜艾会谈期间，纽约先驱论坛报曾列举英美之间存在的矛盾。该报描写美国对英国的指责如下：“（一）英国没有竭尽所能地从事重整军备；（二）英国工党中的某些分子反对为高度动员而作财政上的牺牲；（三）在西欧统一的事情上英国迟迟不前；（四）英国对朝鲜战事没有充分派遣军队参加；（五）大部分英国人试图以‘绥靖’苏联和中国的办法求得和平。”该报又描写英国对美国的不满如下：“（一）美国越来越深地投身于遥远的朝鲜这个角落里的军事中，可能使西欧变成‘无防御’；（二）美国把它的盟国拖入毁灭性的战争中去；（三）就杜鲁门上周在记者招待会上所发表的耸人听闻的谈话看来，美国或会开始投原子弹，而不考虑到可能引起的可怕后果；（四）美国不向苏联作充分积极的接触，以寻求建立和平的途径；（五）越过朝鲜的三八线是麦克阿瑟将军的严重错误，这样便迫使中国‘干涉’朝鲜；（六）美国大众变化无常，因此英国怀疑美国外交政策是否有一贯性。”
    英国对美国的不满，早在十一月底在中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上予美英侵略军以沉重打击后即沸腾起来。这种不满情绪从一般报纸蔓延至某些官方人士。他们把不满发泄在麦克阿瑟身上。英国防大臣辛威尔于三日称：“有一个时候，麦克阿瑟似乎是超出了我们在事件开始时所了解的目标，结果我们走近了驻有庞大中国军队的满洲边境。我们知道那里大约有七万军队准备作战，麦克阿瑟将军可能认为他满可以对付他们。但是，那里可能有更多的军队，他的情报弄错了。我们的处境实在可怕，欺骗自己是没有用的。”据合众社透露：“辛威尔的谈话使英国舆论大哗”，“都认为麦克阿瑟试图由满洲边境前进乃是犯了错误”。
    和辛威尔发表谈话的同一天，英工党议员伊文斯和布罗克威在演说中也对麦克阿瑟大加抨击。伊文斯说：麦克阿瑟是“现实生活中的一个卤莽闯祸的人”，是“俗语所谓闯进了瓷器店里的牛”。伊文斯说：“麦克阿瑟已给自己派定了一个要以武力铲除世界上共产主义的新的政治救世主的角色。但是，这是行不通的。……共产主义是毁灭不掉的。”“亚洲人民不会为维护像李承晚与蒋介石那样腐败的政权而战斗。”保守党的一位议员，约翰·史密斯准将充分透露了英国社会舆论对美国把它拖入世界大战的恐惧。他说：“为了上帝的缘故，别让我们卷入战争吧，因为我相信，我们有这样的危险。假如不能避免另一次世界大战的话，那么，对美国来说，将意味着生活会变得极端不舒服；对英国来说，则将意味着一条走向悲惨的死亡的道路。”
    对于英国人这些责难和避开战争的想法，华盛顿方面反唇相向。据国民党中央社十一日电透露：“美国各报章杂志的主笔、专栏作家，现在仍继续对艾德礼勉强和杜鲁门联合发表‘不姑息’声明一点予以抨击。专栏作家劳伦斯本日痛斥英国短视而不敢正视远东的现实。”劳氏称：“美国子弟在朝鲜流血所争取的‘道义’和‘理想’，似乎已不复存在于英国的外交之中。”“当坚定与团结极关重要之际，联合声明立即予人以恐惧的印象。”劳氏猛烈攻击英国的“短视政策”称：“如果一个主要的盟国在危急之秋言语支吾并卑怯地乞求一个谈判的和平，则精神上的联系将无真正的精神力量可言。”美国新闻处于十七日综合美国报纸杂志一周评论时，透露这些评论斥责“美国的欧洲盟国的骇怕的态度以及懦怯与拖沓”。
    通常反映官方意见的伦敦泰晤士报曾一再为英国的立场作解释。该报指出：美英之间的分歧“是关于方法的而不是关于目的”。“英国从来也不想向共产党中国献殷勤讨好，更不想‘绥靖共产党中国’。”该报承认英国对中国的态度“纯粹是根据事实的需要”。
    但是，无论如何，充斥帝国主义阵营内部的抱怨、不满以及分歧，已使华盛顿笼罩着悲观情绪。代表华尔街意见的《新闻周刊》十二日出版的一期透露：“国务院在成功湖以及在国外所进行的调查，透露了骇人听闻的消息，即：如果对华的战争正式爆发的话，除了两个例外，拉丁美洲、阿拉伯及西欧国家都不会支持美国。”《新闻周刊》承认：“要使英法及其他政府不再反对美国的远东政策将不是一件容易的事。”“我国的‘大棒政策’已有加深我国与其盟国之间的分歧的倾向。”
