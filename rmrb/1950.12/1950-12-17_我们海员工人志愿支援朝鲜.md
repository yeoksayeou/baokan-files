    To the esteemed editors of the People's Daily:
    For nearly a century, imperialism has run rampant in our country, especially in water transportation, where the bloody flags of imperialism flew everywhere on our rivers, seas, and ports. We maritime worker brothers suffered the deepest oppression at their hands. To make a living, we were their beasts of burden, often subjected to their beatings, scolding, and humiliation. We were like orphans who had lost their parents. Today, with the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have gained true liberation and are living good lives. We never thought imperialism would invade us again. American imperialism wants to swallow Korea and use Korea as a springboard to further invade China. We workers can see through these conspiracies. To consolidate the fruits of our laboring people's victory and to defend lasting world peace, we must resolutely repel the invaders.
    This April, I and many other maritime workers joined the war effort and went south to fight the enemy on Hainan Island. It's a pity they escaped too quickly; Hainan Island was liberated before we even arrived. This time, we maritime workers are demanding to support Korea, and we are also constantly preparing to participate in the liberation of Taiwan. Our hearts are firm, and we have experience in fighting reactionaries. We went through more than seventy days of battle in the Wanshan Archipelago, defeating two enemy fleets equipped with so-called American modern weaponry, and even severely wounded Qi Zhihong, the commander of the Kuomintang Third Fleet. Therefore, reactionaries are all paper tigers, and we will definitely defeat these paper tigers.

    我们海员工人志愿支援朝鲜编辑同志：
    近百年来帝国主义在我国横行霸道，特别是在水路运输上，江河海港到处都飘扬着帝国主义血腥的旗帜，我们海员弟兄受他们的压迫最深。我们为了生活，做他们牛马，时常遭受他们打骂与侮辱，我们像失掉父母的孤儿。今天有了毛主席的领导，得到了真正的解放，有好日子过，不想帝国主义又来侵犯我们。美国帝国主义想吞掉朝鲜，利用朝鲜做跳板，进一步再来侵略中国，他这些阴谋手段我们工人都看得到。为了巩固我们劳动者的胜利果实，为了保卫人类持久和平，我们要坚决击退侵略者。
    今年四月，我和很多海员工人参战南下，去打海南岛的敌人，只恨他逃得太快了，我们还没有到，海南岛就解放了。这次，我们海员工人要求支援朝鲜，并且我们还时时在准备着参加解放台湾。我们的心是坚决的，打反动派我们是有经验的，我们在万山群岛经过了七十余天的战斗，打垮了敌人两个所谓美械现代化配备的舰队，甚至把国民党第三舰队司令齐志洪也打得重伤了，所以反动派都是个纸老虎，我们一定能打败这些纸老虎的。  武汉海员工会工业劳模李德心
