    Truth Daily Commentary
    Disagreements Among Atlantic Pact Nations
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 27th (TASS dispatch): The Truth Daily published a commentary entitled "American Newspapers on Disagreements Among Atlantic Pact Nations." The author commented that American imperialists launch wars for many purposes, one of which is to use the already tense international situation to consolidate the Atlantic Alliance and overcome disagreements on fundamental issues—especially the re-militarization of West Germany. In the first few months of the Korean War, American newspapers published many dispatches and articles attempting to prove that the war had a "favorable impact" on the development of relations within the Atlantic Alliance. However, recently, American newspapers have begun to assess the impact of the war on the vitality of the Atlantic Alliance in a very opposite spirit. Now, newspapers are raising the question: Will the Korean War lead to the complete disintegration of the Atlantic Alliance and the international isolation of the United States?

    The latest issue of *Newsweek* wrote: "In the past week, the Korean War has begun to pay the Soviet Union generous interest. The coordination between the United States and its major Western allies on the Korean issue is in danger of disappearing over the policy towards Communist China. The Chinese Communists are expected to arrive at the United Nations this week, and their arrival may bring the problem to the surface... However, at Lake Success, it is not just the resolution of the Korean War that is at a decisive juncture. Western unity in its struggle against Communist forces and Communist machinations is facing its greatest test since the end of World War II."

    *Newsweek* cited reports from its correspondents in London and Washington as proof. The magazine's correspondent in London reported: "Although rumors that Britain would refuse American military aid have been denied, there is indeed a growing sentiment within the British government that favors not rushing to spend money on rearmament. It is quite certain that representatives from both the left and right wings (of the Labour Party) within the British government are willing to base the entire rearmament plan on the principle of 'partnership' (at least nominally), rather than on the principle of dependence on the United States. They believe that this will give Britain greater influence in Western affairs and allow it to prevent the United States from launching a massive arms race against the Soviet Union... At present, the left wing of the government at least advocates a principle according to which the Atlantic Alliance should only arm itself within the possible scope of each member state, without any direct subsidies from the United States. Furthermore, those who support this principle also hope that, in this way, American military spending will also be kept at a less stimulating level."

    The correspondent pointed out that one of the reasons forcing Labour Party members to adhere to this principle is out of consideration for the results of future parliamentary elections. He continued: "In addition, this expression of non-reliance on the United States would be exceptionally popular in Britain. The British know that once a war breaks out—even a war with China—their only choice will be to fight alongside the Americans. They are prepared to do so. However, they are fully determined to avoid war to the best of their ability. The British believe that war is closer now than at any time since the defeat of Japan. Obviously, this situation is mainly caused by the alarm caused by the American reaction to China's intervention in Korea and the blatant distrust of General MacArthur. A cabinet minister (British) recently referred to General MacArthur as 'Russia's secret weapon' in private conversations... Now the British are pinning their desperate hopes on negotiations with the Chinese delegation on its way to New York. London believes that these negotiations should include all Far Eastern issues, from establishing a buffer zone in North Korea to establishing a neutral Asian commission to govern Taiwan... To be perfectly honest, it must be said that the British fear that American emotions will break all limits and make war inevitable, more than they fear that the Soviet Union might launch a war."

    The dispatch from the magazine's Washington correspondent said: "State Department officials admit that there is fear (in Britain) of what the British call the 'irresponsibility' of American foreign policy, which could drag them into dangerous situations. They also admit that in recent weeks, Britain has advocated changing the nature of American participation in European rearmament, so that American 'aid' is merely the American 'contribution' to the public fund, and all participating countries should have an equal say in the allocation of common expenses. They (State Department officials) dismiss the opinion that Britain could now refuse American military aid for political considerations, considering it extremely unlikely; this would confirm the Soviet argument that Britain is an unwilling tool in the hands of American warmongers."

    The Washington correspondent continued: "In any case, in recent days, the United States has become the target of an emergency diplomatic offensive launched by the countries of the British Commonwealth. These countries retorted that the United States is rushing headlong into a major war, and if the United States is not stopped in time, it will drag its allies into the abyss. Some of Britain's fears are deliberately aroused by the State Department." The correspondent also pointed out that regarding various plans for future actions in Korea, the United States specifically issued a "proposition" that if the Chinese continue to encourage and allow their territory to be used as a haven for North Koreans and "volunteers," then the enemy should be pursued even on Chinese territory. The mention of this proposition made Britain and other allies shudder... and Australia... has actually issued an ultimatum to the United States, stating that they must be informed in advance of any decision to extend military operations beyond the Korean border.

    The reporter continued: "The Canadian government submitted a comprehensive memorandum to the U.S. government last week in which the Canadian government advocated that the United States abandon its formally declared intention to resolve the Taiwan issue through the United Nations. The Canadians pointed out that the American proposal angered the Chinese and made them more suspicious of American intentions of aggression; the State Department, feeling the pressure from its allies on the one hand and the pressure from its critics of its China policy, who were encouraged by the victory in the congressional elections, has not yet formulated its own policy."

    The *Christian Science Monitor* published a dispatch from its reporter Edale from Lake Success, which asserted that the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg warned the U.S. government that if it wanted to maintain the unity of the Atlantic Alliance, it had to end the Korean War more quickly.

    American newspapers, in talking about the "crisis" of the Atlantic Alliance, pointed out that in the recent development of policies in Western European countries, there are some tendencies that are enough to make the United States "worry". Among these "unfavorable" tendencies and factors, American commentators have cited the following: (1) Serious disagreements between the United States and other members of the Atlantic Alliance on Far East policy; (2) Britain's wavering on the scale of the expansion plan and its intention to be less dependent on the United States; (3) France's resistance to German re-militarization; (4) The lack of real consensus between the United States, Britain, and France on the recent Soviet proposals regarding the German question; (5) American newspapers believe that the strengthening of the position of the Schumacher faction in West Germany will complicate the entire issue of rearming Germany.

    A dispatch from the London correspondent of the *Christian Science Monitor* suggested that Washington consider the following facts: "Even right-wing representatives in the British government like Bevin or Gaitskell are willing to have American military aid take such a form that would make Britain look less like a poor relative and more like a partner with equal rights." The correspondent wrote, "It should not be denied that the spirit of independence has revived in Britain, and this spirit will probably be slightly reflected in foreign policy in the future." The correspondent continued, "When Marshall Plan aid stops, those forces that originally influenced British foreign policy to value Washington's wishes will be weakened."

    A United Press reporter reported from London that a British official representative was said to have said: "There is no question that our economic situation has improved considerably in the past six months, and our need for Marshall Plan aid is now really not very great. It is possible that Britain will not only be able to survive without this aid, but also be able to bear most of the expenses required for the three-year expansion plan." Think about what a spiritual encouragement this is for the British! The British will raise their glasses in all British clubs and say: "Finally, we don't have to rely on the Americans anymore."

    A report from Paris by a reporter for *The Chicago Tribune* pointed out that one of the reasons why the Atlantic Alliance military organization is on the verge of bankruptcy is that the Pentagon (the location of the US Department of Defense—editor's note) disregards the opinions of its allies. The reporter wrote: The fierce dispute over the issue of German re-militarization has put all military plans in a dangerous stalemate, "This dispute is the result of the Pentagon's unilateral decision that West Germany must provide ten divisions. Someone simply advised Britain and France not to join this plan... The Pentagon raised the issue of German rearmament without any warning, which shows that they lack clear political judgment."

    American newspapers unanimously believe that the results of the last elections in Hesse and Württemberg-Baden (both in West Germany—editor's note) are new troubles that arise with West German militarization.

    A reporter for *The New York Herald Tribune* sent a message from Frankfurt, saying that the mood of the "Americans" there is very pessimistic. The results of the elections have overturned the optimistic hopes for an accelerated solution to the issue of German re-militarization, and foreshadowed: "In this period, the infighting and diplomatic bargaining between the Western allies and West Germany, and between the Western allies themselves, will intensify." And "The West German government is likely to demand more concessions from the allies in economic and political aspects before it agrees to provide military forces for Western defense."

    The reporter, pointing out that the U.S. government has decided to extend the increase of its troops stationed in West Germany, said: "Similarly, the United States has not yet ventured to appoint Eisenhower as the supreme commander of Europe, because the question of whom he will command and how to command has not yet been decided."

    *The New York Times* commentator McCormick wrote: "The dispute between France and the United States over the conditions under which Germans can be allowed to rearm is based on an illusion, namely: that Germans as citizens of a militaristic country are eager to put on uniforms and go to the battlefield. They were like this in the past, and they may still be like this in the future; however, just when the West is desperately trying to show its military strength, these defeated people simply don't want to fight... It is really strange that this enemy, who was forced to disarm only five years ago, now refuses to obey the rearmament order of his 'conquerors'."

    *The New York Times*' November 20th editorial clearly described the predicament of the Atlantic Alliance. The newspaper wrote: "The terrible mistake was made precisely because we hoped that we would quickly and forcefully begin to strengthen the material strength of the Western world."

    The newspaper emphasized: This is very obvious today, almost five months after the Korean incident.

    It is enough to recall the extreme excitement in the first few weeks (of the Korean War) and the determination expressed everywhere at that time—the West must rearm, and the Atlantic Alliance in particular must be quickly strengthened to cope with the threat from the East. What is the situation now? In the United States and Britain, there have been some real improvements in rearmament, although perhaps not enough; but in Western Europe, one can see a state of paralysis and miserable chaos, which is most clearly manifested in the fact that the Atlantic Alliance organization cannot achieve any practical results. We are in all kinds of fears. Britain and France are afraid that Asia will divert the attention of the United States, and thus Europe will be weakened. There is a fear of appearing too tough on the Soviet Union and China; but at the same time, Europe's behavior is different and accuses the United States of not having a consistent policy. If we don't have this policy, it is because Europe, in a situation that requires strong and bold decisions, shows confusion, cowardice, and hesitation. In other words, we are going around in a vicious circle. This problem is most acute in France. The French believe that our policy is too tough, but we think our policy is too weak; as for Britain, so far no one has been able to complain that it does not want to rearm, or that it does not want to pursue a bold anti-communist policy... But there is a reasonable criticism of British policy, and this is about the whole complex issue of European unification. As Reynaud said, it cannot be denied that Britain is limping behind. One of its main arguments drags us into a new vicious circle. The British don't trust the French, and the French say that Europe cannot be strong if Britain doesn't take on greater responsibility. ...

    "The more we analyze this situation, the clearer we see that France holds the key to European policy. But it is equally clear that France neither wants to open the door with this key, nor does it want to close it. Its tragedy is hesitation... The result is inaction, or, at best, only a tendency to find a third way. ... Therefore, the main task of American foreign policy is to assure France and convince it that our path is the only path worth following."

    Representatives of extreme factions of American imperialists, after encountering these new difficulties in Europe, suggested breaking through all obstacles and estimating every diplomatic strategy as a manifestation of "appeasement." Therefore, *The New York World-Telegram and Sun* said in an editorial: "Germany used to support the balance of power in Europe... In any case, the United States can no longer waste time trying in vain to convince France of the need to follow a realistic policy. If possible, we must act together with France, but if necessary, we will act alone without it. West Germany is an indispensable element in a strong European military plan, and we cannot agree to any conditions less than this." However, since the road to achieving this goal is now not only blocked by the French, but also by the Germans, some extremists have suggested forcing the Germans to serve as soldiers. According to a report from *The New York Times*' Frankfurt correspondent, some of McCloy's (the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany—editor's note) staff members and some other American military representatives are quite in favor of returning to the "policy of 1945." That policy, expressed in an idiom, is: "Give them this dish, and if they don't like it, shove it down their throats."

    Lawrence, in *The New York Herald Tribune*, aimed his main fire at Britain. In a Washington dispatch, he wrote: "U.S.-British relations may need to be 'revised'. What surprised this place was that London's diplomatic circles apparently misjudged the current mood of American public opinion, they thought that the United States would be willing to deal with the Far East Communists at any cost for peace. The 'comprehensive' solution planned by Britain is of this meaning... In the past few days, Britain has begun to work in a typical elegant manner to advocate appeasing Asian communism... Is Britain trying to use this to convince the United States that the Socialist or 'left-wing' government genuinely expresses goodwill to the Moscow government regarding the intentions of the Far East? Or is this tactic merely to cover up its attempt to force the United States to abandon the Far East and give more financial and military assistance to Europe? No matter what motives are hidden behind the strange steps of British diplomacy, the current situation does not show any good signs for future Anglo-American relations. Once Washington definitively believes that Britain is unwilling to stand up against the communist danger anywhere in the world, the concern for assisting Europe will decrease, and the call for using all existing American resources to organize its own army, navy, and air force to defend the United States will increase. This road will be a tragic mistake. Britain may try its best to appease communism and barely promote peace in the Far East. This is absolutely unacceptable to American public opinion."

    A large part of the American newspapers believe that using the methods suggested by the extremists to solve delicate political problems has very dangerous consequences for the United States. French reporter Schreiber warned against using this method in *The New York Herald Tribune*, he wrote: "In the past ten days, the struggle for Europe has entered a new stage due to two factors. The first factor is the powerful diplomatic propaganda carried out by the Soviet Union under the slogan of German unity. The second factor is the psychological impact of the U.S. congressional elections on many European leaders... Europe is the battlefield of the Cold War. Europeans are divided into two camps, and between these two camps, a permanent internal struggle is taking place... One camp favors the Atlantic Alliance, and the other camp favors maintaining neutrality in the Cold War."

    Schreiber pointed out that the results of the American elections have forced some European leaders to conclude that the concept of Taft-Byrd foreign policy will now have a more powerful impact. This will mean two things: "First, deep suspicion of Europe's ability to independently use American economic assistance, and Europe's desire to use American military assistance. This will reduce assistance and make Europe a supporting role in the Atlantic Alliance. Second, the United States is more willing to risk a full-scale war rather than bear the heavy burden of taxes and controls in many years or decades of Cold War. ... Europe of course believes that full-scale war is equal to complete destruction. Finally, if these two tendencies, which have become very obvious today, are intensified, the political struggle in Europe may have another shift. Those who support neutrality will certainly be strengthened by the new attitude of the Soviet Union. Supporters of the North Atlantic Alliance will likewise be weakened because of leaving the Truman-Acheson policy and compromising with the Taft-Byrd policy. In other words, we are probably entering a state of crisis, and this crisis threatens the leadership of a group of Atlantic Alliance supporters in Europe."

    *Newsweek* magazine commentator Lindley believes that the greatest danger facing the United States is the danger of suffering international isolation. In the latest issue of the magazine, Lindley, after pointing out some of the dangers that have already occurred in the United States, wrote: "Another danger has now emerged: the free world may split, and we will find that we are actually isolated. The United Nations joint front, which was re-established due to the Korean invasion, is unstable. Especially important is that even the Atlantic Alliance is unstable. Before armed forces capable of defending Western Europe can be formed, the Atlantic Alliance is merely a promise by the United States, Britain, and Canada to fight if they encounter aggression within the Atlantic Alliance area." Lindley, after pointing out the results of France's "stubborn attitude" on the issue of German re-militarization, went on to say: "At present, some other common symptoms have begun to appear. The political leaders of some European countries have shown hesitation when the issue of sacrifice is raised, and sacrifice is inevitably associated with the necessary scale of rearmament. Among these political leaders are prominent cabinet members of the British government. The voices of appeasers are sounding loudly again. But in the United States, the recent elections have strengthened the anti-European faction of the Republican Party. This faction will gain many supporters once it becomes impossible to defend Europe, not because we are unwilling to fulfill our responsibilities, but because Europeans do not want to fulfill their responsibilities. Every indication that well-known American political leaders occasionally reveal that we may not fulfill our responsibilities is immediately used by appeasers overseas. The most pressing danger of the Atlantic Alliance is the disagreement on the policy towards Communist China. ... Our diplomacy must be resourceful and combine firmness and flexibility to prevent the free world from suffering a terrible split in the coming weeks. Irresponsible opinions must not be allowed to make diplomatic work more difficult. President Truman can convene leaders from both parties to assist and, after proving to them the existence of serious dangers, seek their opinions and obtain mutual understanding."

    *The Washington Post* suggested making every effort to resolve the disagreements among the countries of the Atlantic Alliance on the basis of some compromise. The newspaper's editorial pointed out that the United States has missed the "good opportunity" to establish a unified command of the Atlantic Alliance, the editorial said: "There are some signs that France intends to compromise on the number of German military forces in the Atlantic army. However, the Soviet Union took advantage of France's fears and proposed that the four countries renegotiate the German issue, obviously using this to cancel France's intention."

    Later, new obstacles—obstacles from West Germany and Britain—appeared again. *The Washington Post* wrote that in order to break the deadlock, "There is only one way. The President should invite the heads of government of France, Germany, Britain, and Canada to Washington. Because the degree of spiritual depression is so deep that foreign ministers can no longer improve the current situation... It is extremely necessary to resolve disagreements through compromise with new efforts, but it must not be too late so that this compromise loses any military value. If this effort fails, the entire situation must be reviewed, and some alternative plans must be formulated."

    真理报评论
    大西洋公约缔约国之间的分歧
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：真理报以“美国报纸论大西洋公约缔约国之间的分歧”为题发表评论。作者评称，美帝国主义者发动战争有许多目的，其中有一个就是希望利用已经紧张的国际形势来巩固大西洋联盟和克服在基本问题上——特别是西德重新军事化问题上——的分歧。在朝鲜战争的头几个月中，美国报纸发表了许多电讯和专文，企图证明这次战争对大西洋联盟内部关系发展有“有利的影响”。然而，最近美国报纸却开始以十分相反的精神来估计这次战争对大西洋联盟的生命力的影响了。现在，报纸提出了这样一个问题：朝鲜战争会不会导致大西洋联盟的完全瓦解和美国在国际上的孤立。
    最近一期的《新闻周刊》写道：“在上星期中，朝鲜战争已开始偿付苏联以优厚的利息。美国和其主要西方盟国在朝鲜问题上的协调已有在对共产党中国的政策问题上消失的危险。预料中国共产党人将于本星期抵达联合国，他们的抵达可能促使问题表面化……然而在成功湖，还不仅是朝鲜战争的解决是处在决定性的关头。西方在其反对共产主义力量以及共产党人的诡计之斗争中，它的团结碰到了自从第二次世界大战结束以来最大的考验。”
    新闻周刊引证其驻伦敦及华盛顿的记者的报道作为证明。该杂志的记者自伦敦报道说：“尽管英国将拒绝美国军事援助的谣传已被否认，可是英国政府内部确实有一种情绪在增长着，这种情绪赞成不忙为重整军备而支出金钱。十分肯定，英国政府中左右两翼（工党）的代表们愿意使整个重整军备计划根据‘合伙’原则（至少在名义上），而不是根据依赖美国的原则。他们认为，这将使英国在西方事物上能有更大的影响并使它得以使美国不对苏联展开巨大的军备竞赛。……在目前，政府左翼至少在拥护一个原则，按照这个原则，大西洋联盟只应在各盟国的可能范围之内自行武装，而不要美国任何直接补助。此外，拥护这个原则的人也希望，这样，美国的军费也将可以保持在不那么刺激人的水平上。”
    该记者指出：迫使工党分子坚持这个原则的理由之一是出于对将来议会选举结果的考虑。他继续说：“此外，不依赖美国的这种表示，在英国会异常受欢迎。英国人知道，一旦战争发生——即使是与中国发生战争——，他们唯一的选择将是站在美国人一边作战。他们是准备这样做的。但是，他们具有充分的决心，要尽他们的可能力量来避免战争。英国人相信：战争在现在比战胜日本以来任何时候都更为逼近了。显然这种情况主要是因为美国对中国干涉朝鲜的反应而产生的惊恐以及对于麦克阿瑟将军公然的不信任引起的。（英国）政府的一位阁员近来在私下的谈话中称麦克阿瑟将军为“俄国的秘密武器”……现在英国人把绝望的希望寄托在与正在赴纽约途中的中国代表团的谈判上。伦敦相信：这些谈判应包括一切远东问题，从在北朝鲜建立缓冲区到建立中立的亚洲委员会以管制台湾的问题。贝文并希望讨论有关共产党中国在草拟对日和约中可能起的作用的问题……。要做到十分诚恳，就必须要说英国害怕美国的情绪会打破一切的限制而使战争成为不可避免，胜于害怕苏联可能发动战争。”
    该杂志驻华盛顿记者的电讯说：“国务院官员们承认，（在英国）对英国人所谓美国外交政策的‘不负责任’存在着恐惧，这种政策能够把他们拖进危险的局势中。他们同时也承认：最近几周来，英国主张改变美国参加欧洲重整军备的性质，以使美国‘援助’仅仅是公共基金中美国‘捐献’的那一分，并且一切参加的国家在分配共同经费方面应有同等的发言权。他们（国务院的官员们）摈斥下一种意见，即英国由于政治上的考虑能在现在拒绝美国军事援助，他们认为这是极其不可能的；这样就证实了苏联的论调，即英国是美国战争贩子手中并非心甘情愿的工具。”
    这位驻华盛顿记者继续写道：“无论如何在最近几天中，美国已成为不列颠联邦各国所发动的紧急外交攻势的目标。这些国家反驳说：美国正在急急忙忙地投身大战，而如果不及时阻止美国的话，它会把它的同盟国家也拖入深渊中去。英国的恐惧有些是国务院故意引起的。”该记者又指出：关于为了在朝鲜未来的行动而作的各种计划，美国特别发表了一个“主张”，即如果中国人继续鼓励并允许把他们的领土作为北朝鲜人和“志愿兵”的避难所的话，那么就要甚至在中国领土上追击敌人。一提到这个主张，就使得英国和其他同盟国家战栗……而澳大利亚……实际上已向美国提出最后通牒，声明他们必须事先获悉把军事行动进至朝鲜边境以外的任何决定。
    记者继称：“加拿大政府曾在上周向美国政府递交了一个综合性的备忘录，在这个备忘录中，加拿大政府主张美国放弃其正式宣布过的要经由联合国解决台湾问题的意图。加拿大人指出：美国的提案激怒了中国人，使他们更加怀疑美国有侵略意图；国务院一方面感到它的盟国的压力，另一方面又感到它的中国政策批评者他们受到了国会选举胜利的鼓舞的压力，以致它迄今还没有制定出它自己的政策来。”
    《指南针日报》刊出了它的记者艾戴尔自成功湖拍发的电讯，其中断言：比利时，荷兰与卢森堡政府警告美国政府说：如果它希望保持大西洋联盟的统一，就必须更快地结束朝鲜战争。
    美国报纸在谈到大西洋联盟的“危机”时指出：最近在西欧各国政策的发展中，有一些足以令美国“忧虑”的倾向。在这些“不利的”倾向与因素中，美国的评论家们举出了下面的几项：（一）美国与大西洋联盟其他成员国间在远东政策问题上的严重分歧；（二）英国对扩军计划的规模游移不定以及它想比较不倚赖美国的意向；（三）法国对德国重新军国主义化的反抗；（四）美国、英国与法国间在最近苏联关于德国问题的建议方面没有取得真正的一致；（五）美国报纸认为：舒马赫分子在西德的地位之加强，会使整个重新武装德国的问题趋于复杂。
    基督教科学箴言报驻伦敦记者的电讯，建议华盛顿考虑下列事实：“甚至英国政府中像贝文或贾兹克尔这样的右翼代表们，也愿意美国军事援助采取这样的方式，这种方式将使英国看起来不像是个穷亲戚，而像一个有同等权利的伙伴。”该记者写道，“不应该否认，在英国，独立精神又复活起来，这种精神今后大概要略微反映在外交政策上了。”该记者继续说：“当马歇尔计划援助停止时，原来影响英国外交政策去重视华盛顿愿望的那些推动力将被削弱了。”
    合众社记者从伦敦报道说：据说英国的一位官方代表曾说过：“毫无问题，在过去六个月中，我们的经济情况有相当大的改进，我们现在对马歇尔计划援助的需要实在是不很大的。有可能，英国将不仅能够不要这个援助而活下去，并且能够担负三年扩军计划所需经费的大部分。”想想罢，这对英国人是怎样的一个精神鼓励啊！英国人将在一切英国俱乐部中举杯说道：“到底我们不要再靠美国佬了。”
    《芝加哥的报》记者发自巴黎的报道中指出：大西洋联盟军事组织濒于破产的原因之一是五角大厦（美国国防部所在地——编者注）不顾其盟国的意见。该记者写道：在德国重新军事化问题上的激烈争吵使得所有的军事计划都陷于危险的僵局，“这种争吵是五角大厦片面决定西德必须提供十个师的结果。有人干脆地劝告英国和法国不要加入这个计划……五角大厦未经任何的预告就提出了德国重整军备问题，这表明他们缺乏清醒的政治判断。”
    美国报纸一致认为，黑森和瓦登堡——巴登（均在西德——编者注）上次的选举结果是随着西德军事化而产生的新的麻烦。
    《纽约先驱论坛报》记者发自法兰克福的消息说，该地“美国人士”的心境非常悲观。选举的结果推翻了加速解决德国重新军事化问题的乐观希望，并且预示了：“在今后这一时期中，西方盟国与西德之间，以及西方盟国本身之间的勾心斗角和外交上的讨价还价将日益加紧。”而且“西德政府很可能要求盟国在经济与政治方面作更多的让步，然后才会同意提供军事部队充西方防御之用”。
    该记者在指出美国政府决定展期增加其在西德的驻军以后说道：“同样的，美国也还没有冒昧任命艾森豪威尔担任欧洲最高统帅，因为关于他将指挥什么人以及怎样来指挥的问题还没有决定。”
    《纽约时报》评论员麦克考米克写道：“法国和美国在关于在什么条件下才可以允许德国人重新武装的问题上的争执乃是根据一个幻想，即：作为一个军国主义国家之国民的德国人是急于要穿上制服走上战场的。过去他们既是这样，他们将来也可能还是这样；可是，正当西方拚命地想显示其军事力量的时候，这些被打垮了的人民却简直不想打仗……，这个仅在五年以前被迫解除武装的敌人现在竟拒绝顺从他的‘征服者’的重新武装的命令，这真是十分奇怪的事。”
    《纽约时报》十一月二十日的社会清楚地描述了大西洋联盟所处的窘境。该报写道：“就是由于我们希望我们会迅速而有力地开始加强西方世界的物质力量，因此才铸成了可怕的错误。”
    报纸强调：在朝鲜事件发生后差不多五个月的今天，这一点是十分明显的了。
    只要回想一下（朝鲜战争的）头几个星期中的极度兴奋以及那时各处所表示的决心——西方必须重整军备、大西洋联盟特别必须迅速加强以应付来自东方的威胁——就够了。现在的事情如何呢？在美国和英国，重整军备方面有了一些真正的改进，尽管也许是不够的；但是在西欧，却可以看到瘫痪的状态与悲惨的混乱，这在大西洋同盟组织不能达成任何实际的结果一点上最清楚地表现出来。我们处在各种各样的恐惧中。英、法恐怕亚洲将转移美国的注意力，因而欧洲遭到削弱。有一种恐惧心理，害怕对苏联和中国表现得太强硬；但是就在同时，欧洲的行为却又不同并且责备美国没有一贯的政策。如果我们没有这种政策，原因是欧洲在要求作有力的与大胆的决定的情势中，表现出混乱、怯懦、和犹豫不决。换句话说，我们是在恶性循环中兜圈子。这个问题在法国表现最尖锐。法国人相信我们的政策是太强硬了，我们却认为我们的政策是太软弱了；至于英国，迄今还没有一个人能够抱怨说它不要重整军备，或不要奉行大胆的反共政策……但是对于英国政策却有一种有道理的批评，这是关于整个复杂的欧洲统一问题。如雷诺所说，英国跟在尾巴后面跛行是不能否认的。它的主要论据之一把我们拖进新的恶性循环中。英国人不信任法国人，法国人说，如果英国不负起更重大的责任，欧洲是不能强盛的。……
    “我们越分析这个局势就越看得清楚，即法国握有欧洲政策的钥匙。但同样清楚的是：法国既不想用这把钥匙开门，也不想用它关门。它的悲剧就是犹豫不决……其结果就是无所作为，或者，充其量也只是有寻找第三条道路的倾向。……因此，美国外交政策的主要任务是向法国保证并使它相信：我们的道路是唯一值得遵循的道路。”
    美帝国主义者极端派的代表们在欧洲遭遇到这些新的困难后，就建议冲破一切障碍，把每一种外交策略估计为“姑息政策”的表现。因此，《纽约世界电讯太阳报》在社会中说：“德国从前是支持欧洲的均势的……无论如何，美国再也不能耗费时间来徒劳地使法国相信遵循现实主义政策的必要性了。如果可能的话，我们固然必须与法国一起行动，但如果必要的话，我们也就不要它而单独行动。西德是强有力的欧洲军事计划中不可缺少的要素，少于这一点的任何条件我们都不能够同意。”但是，由于达到这个目标的道路现在不但为法国人所阻碍，并且也被德国人所阻碍，所以某些极端主义分子便建议强迫德国人当兵。据《纽约时报》法兰克福记者的报道，麦克洛埃（美国驻西德高级专员——编者）的某些参谋人员和其他的一些美国军事代表颇有赞成重回到“一九四五年的政策”的意思。那个政策用成语表达出来就是：“给他们这盘菜，如果他们不喜欢它，就塞进他们的喉咙里去”。
    劳伦士在《纽约先驱论坛报》将主要的火力针对着英国。他在华盛顿通讯中写道：“美英关系也许需要‘加以修改’。使此间大感惊奇的是：伦敦的外交界显然错估了美国舆论目前的情绪，他们以为美国会为和平而愿意不惜任何代价去与远东共产党打交道的。英国所筹划的‘全面’解决就是这个意义。……在过去几天中，英国开始以典型风雅的态度为赞成姑息亚洲的共产主义而努力……英国是不是要借此使美国相信：社会党人的或‘左翼’的政府真心对莫斯科政府关于远东的意图表示好感呢？还是这种手腕仅仅是要掩盖它想迫使美国放弃远东而予欧洲以更多的财政和军事援助的企图呢？不论英国外交的奇怪的步骤后面藏着什么动机，目前情势并没有为未来英美关系显示任何佳兆。一俟华盛顿方面肯定地认为英国不愿意挺身出来反对世界任何地方的共产党危险，对于援助欧洲的关心便会减少，而要求以美国一切现有资财来组织自己的陆海空军保卫美国的呼声便会增加。这种道路将是悲剧的错误。英国也许会竭尽他们的智力来绥靖共产主义，并在远东勉强促成和平。这是美国的舆论所绝对不能接受的。”
    一大部分美国报纸认为，用极端主义者所建议使用的方法解决微妙的政治问题，对美国是有着非常危险的后果的。法国记者史列伯在《纽约先驱论坛报》上警告不要使用这种方法，他写道：“在过去十天之中，争夺欧洲的斗争由于两个因素已进入新阶段。第一个因素是苏联在德国统一的口号下所进行的有力外交宣传。第二个因素是美国国会选举对许多欧洲领袖的心理上的影响。……欧洲是冷战的战场。欧洲人分为两个阵营，在这两个阵营之间，永久性的内部斗争正在进行……一个阵营赞成大西洋联盟，另一个阵营赞成在冷战中保持中立。”
    史列伯指出：美国选举的结果迫使若干欧洲领袖得出这样结论：塔夫脱——柏尔德外交政策的概念现在将发生更有力的影响。这将意味着两件事：“第一，深切怀疑欧洲独立地使用美国经济援助的能力，和欧洲使用美国军事援助的愿望。这将使援助减少，并使欧洲在大西洋联盟中成为配角。第二，美国更愿意宁可冒全面战争的危险，而不愿在许多年或几十年的冷战中担负沉重的赋税和管制的重担。……欧洲当然认为全面战争就等于完全毁灭。最后，如果今天已经变得很明显的这两个倾向变本加厉，欧洲的政治斗争可能有另一个转变。支持中立的人们一定会因苏联的新态度而得到加强。北大西洋联盟的支持者同样地一定会因为离开杜鲁门——艾奇逊政策并趋向与塔夫脱——柏尔德政策妥协而被削弱。换句话说，我们大概正进入危机的状态，这种危机威胁着欧洲一批大西洋联盟支持者的领导作用。”
    《新闻周刊》杂志评论员林德莱认为，美国最大的危险是遭受国际孤立的危险。在该杂志最近一期中，林德莱在指出美国目前已经发生的若干危险后写道：“目前又出现了另外一个危险：自由世界可能分裂，我们会发现我们实际上是孤立的。由于朝鲜侵略而重新建立起来的联合国联合阵线是不稳固的。尤其重要的是：连大西洋联盟也是不稳固的。在组成能够保卫西欧的武装部队以前，大西洋联盟不过是美、英、加答应一旦在大西洋联盟区域内遭遇到侵略时，它们即出而作战的诺言而已”。林德莱在指出法国在德国重新军事化问题上“态度顽固”的结果后，接着说：“目前，某些其他的共同症候开始显露出来了。某些欧洲国家的政治领袖当要牺牲的问题提出来时，就表现得犹豫不决，而牺牲是不可避免地和必要规模的重整军备相关联的。在这些政治领袖中有英国政府的著名阁员。绥靖主义者的呼声重又响亮起来了。但在美国，最近的选举已加强了共和党反欧派的力量。这一派在一旦防卫欧洲成为不可能时，将获得许多的拥护者，这并不是因为我们不愿尽我们的职责，而是因为欧洲人不想尽他们的职责。知名的美国政治领袖们偶然透露的我们可能不尽我们职责的每一次表示都立即会为海外的绥靖主义分子所利用。大西洋联盟的最迫切的危险是在对共产党中国政策问题上的分歧。……我们的外交必须足智多谋，刚柔兼施，俾能防止自由世界在今后几星期中发生可怕的分裂。绝不容许不负责任的意见使外交工作更趋困难。杜鲁门总统可以召集两党领袖，来加以协助，并且在向他们证明严重危险的存在后，征求他们的意见和取得相互的谅解。”
    《华盛顿邮报》建议，尽一切努力在某些折衷的基础上来解决大西洋联盟各国间的分歧。该报社论指出：美国已经错过了建立大西洋联盟统一司令部的“良好时机”，社论说：“有若干迹象表示，法国有意在大西洋军队中的德国军事部队的数目上让步。但是，苏联利用了法国的恐惧，提出四国重新谈判德国问题的建议，显然借此打销了法国的这种意向。”
    后来新的障碍——来自西德和英国的障碍——又出现了。华盛顿邮报写道，为了要打破僵局，“只有一条道路。总统应该邀请法、德、英、加四国政府元首到华盛顿来。因为精神上颓丧的程度太深，以致外长们已经不能改善现在的局势了……以新的努力通过折衷办法来解决分歧是极端必要的，然而不能太晚致使这种折衷办法丧失任何军事价值。如果这个努力失败了，则必须检讨整个局势，并且拟定若干代替的计划。”
