    [Our Newspaper] All employees of the Beijing Railway Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration, in the patriotic production emulation campaign to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country, responded to Minister Teng Daiyuan's call and completed the annual transportation task 22 days ahead of schedule on December 9th. On December 9th, the branch completed 100.9% of the annual loading task. The annual new line construction of the engineering department was completed earlier on November 30th, and the road maintenance overhaul and medium repair were completed on October 30th, while maintenance was also completed in November. The technical speed of freight locomotives has rapidly increased: from 25.7 kilometers in January to 30.4 kilometers at present. According to statistics from May to October, 7,774,457.73 kilograms of locomotive coal were saved in six months, saving 14.5% according to the bureau's standards.

    The reason for these achievements is mainly the efforts of all employees and the correct leadership of the higher authorities, which launched the movement to create new records. In the past year, four exemplary sections and stations with the most outstanding achievements have emerged in the branch: Fengtai Locomotive Depot, Xizhimen Station, Dingxing and Xibozidao maintenance teams, and a number of labor models have emerged, driving the work of various units. Under the direct assistance of the National Railway Trade Union, Fengtai Locomotive Depot and Engineering Depot established collective contracts, and ten sections and five stations followed suit. Xizhimen Station adopted the method of contact contracts to establish close joint labor among various production departments. Fengtai Train Depot completed a record of one million kilometers without accidents on September 10th. With the help of Soviet experts, Fengtai Locomotive Depot established the A and B inspection assembly line operation method and promoted it to various sections, greatly saving man-hours and tools. Dingxing Road Maintenance District implemented the road maintenance assembly line operation method and promoted it to more than 20 work districts. National labor model Li Yonglu and his contracted crew safely drove locomotive No. 1939, extending three A-level inspections. Liu Dehe united the road maintenance workers in the entire work district and created the exemplary Xibozidao work district. Because the branch implemented the "thorough inventory reward" at the end of April, and held celebration meetings extensively and in-depth, the employees felt that "their merits had not been buried." Some said, "The Communist Party really doesn't bury talent. Those who produced well last year are still rewarded this year." From January to November, the entire branch issued a total of 654,256 salary points in bonuses, equivalent to 1,308,512 jin of millet. Since the branch established vocational schools in March, 8,527 employees have enrolled, and the cultural and professional level of the employees has gradually improved. The employees recall the suffering of the past, see the happiness of today, and thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    The crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading Taiwan, Korea, and bombing Northeast China have aroused the anger of all employees. Workers at the Dingxing Road Maintenance Team said, "We will never be second-class slaves." Loading and unloading workers in Gucheng said, "We've just had a taste of peace, and the U.S. imperialists are throwing sand in our rice bowl. We must fight them!" Two thousand and sixty-five employees have voluntarily signed up to join the Volunteer Army. The employees have also poured into the production upsurge with the enthusiasm of turning hatred into strength, putting forward powerful slogans such as "The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the weapon," "The operation is the battle," "Eliminating an accident is equivalent to eliminating an American soldier," and "Increasing production by one point is increasing the strength to Resist America and Aid Korea by one point." Therefore, a vigorous patriotic production emulation campaign to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country has been launched in various places. Li Yong, the heroic driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, put forward the slogan of "More hauling, faster running" and launched an over-axle movement. Locomotives in various places have responded enthusiastically, and 14 locomotives have now successfully exceeded the axle load. The "Mao Zedong" locomotive also completed the glorious achievement of safe driving of 200,000 kilometers on December 7th.

    After the branch completed the annual task 22 days ahead of schedule, it immediately wrote a letter to Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways, stating that it would continue to improve production efficiency, reduce costs, eliminate accidents, resolutely complete winter transportation, and strive for more over-fulfillment of tasks.

    [Beijing News Agency] All employees of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration wrote a letter to Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, to celebrate the early completion of the annual transportation task. The original text is as follows:

    We, the employees of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration, are pleased to report good news to you. We are now experiencing double happiness. At a time when Resist America, Aid Korea is gaining great victories, all our employees have turned their anger at U.S. imperialism into strength, launched a patriotic production emulation campaign, and responded to Minister Teng's call to complete the annual transportation task seven days ahead of schedule. We have victoriously completed the annual task 22 days ahead of schedule on December 9th and are determined to continue to improve production efficiency, reduce costs, eliminate accidents, resolutely complete winter transportation, and strive for more over-fulfillment of tasks.

    With respectful greetings,
    All employees of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration
    December 9, 1950

    北京铁路局全体职工开展爱国主义竞赛            
    提前二十二天完成全年任务            
    写信给滕部长、彭真同志保证超额完成冬运任务
    【本报讯】天津铁路管理局北京铁路分局全体职工，在抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，响应滕代远部长的号召，于十二月九日提前二十二天完成了全年运输任务。十二月九日该分局完成了全年装车任务的百分之一百点九。全年工务新建线路早于十一月三十日完成，养路大修中修更于十月三十日完成，维修亦于十一月完成。货物机车技术速度迅速提高：一月份为二五点七公里，现为三○点四公里。根据五至十月的统计，六个月中节约机煤七、七七四、四五七·七三公斤，按局定标准节约百分之一四点五。
    获得这些成绩的原因，主要是全体职工的努力和上级正确的领导，展开了创造新纪录运动。一年来该分局出现了四个最有成绩的典型的段、站：丰台机务段，西直门车站，定兴、西拨子道班，涌现了一批劳动模范，带动了各个单位的工作。丰台机务段和工务段在铁路总工会直接帮助下，建立了集体合同，并使十个段、五个站跟着建立了集体合同。西直门车站采取联系合同的方法，使各种不同的生产部门，建立起密切的联合劳动。丰台车务段九月十日完成百万公里无事故的纪录。丰台机务段在苏联专家帮助下，建立乙、丙检流水作业法，并推广到各段，大大的节约了工时、工具。定兴养路工区实行了养路流水作业法，推广到二十多个工区。全国劳动模范李永禄及他的包乘组安全驾驶一九三九号机车，延长了三个甲检。刘德合团结了全工区的养路工人，创造了模范的西拨子工区。由于该分局四月底实行了“清底奖励”，普遍而深入的召开庆功会，职工觉得“功劳没有被埋没”，有的说：“共产党真不埋没人材，去年生产好的今年还奖”。从一月到十一月止，全分局已共发奖金六五四、二五六薪分，折合小米一、三○八、五一二斤。该分局从三月开始设立业余学校以来，现已有八、五二七名职工入学，职工文化水平及业务水平逐步提高，职工们回忆过去的苦痛，看到今天的幸福，都感谢共产党和毛主席。
    美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜和美机轰炸东北的罪行，激起了全体职工的愤怒。定兴道班工人说：“决不当二次亡国奴”。固城装卸工人说：“咱们刚好吃碗太平饭，美帝给撒砂子，咱们要和他拚！”两千零六十五名职工曾自动报名参加志愿军。职工们并在化仇恨为力量的热情下，投入了生产的热潮，提出“工厂即战场，机器即武器”，“作业即是战斗”，“消灭一件事故就等于消灭一个美国兵”，“增加一分生产即是增加一分抗美援朝力量”等有力的口号。因之各地展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义生产竞赛运动。“毛泽东号”机车司机长李永老英雄，提出“多拉快跑”的号召，展开超轴运动。各地机车纷纷响应，现已有十四台机车胜利超轴。“毛泽东号”机车又于十二月七日完成了安全走行二十万公里的光荣业绩。
    在该分局提前二十二天完成全年任务以后，随即写信给铁道部滕代远部长，表示将继续提高生产效能，减低成本，消灭事故，坚决完成冬季运输，争取更多的超过任务。
    【京市新闻处讯】天津铁路管理局北京分局全体职工为提前完成全年运输任务，特写信给中共北京市委书记彭真同志，原文如下：
    我们天津铁路管理局北京分局全体职工谨向您来报喜。我们现在是双喜临门，正在抗美援朝获得大胜利的时候，我们全体职工把对美帝国主义的愤怒变为力量，开展爱国主义生产竞赛，及响应滕部长提前七天完成全年运输任务的号召下，已于十二月九日提前二十二天胜利的完成全年任务了，并决心继续提高生产效能，减低成本，消灭事故，坚决完成冬运，争取更多的超过任务。
    谨致敬礼
    天津铁路管理局北京分局全体职工
    一九五○年十二月九日
