    After full deliberation and in-depth study
    College and Middle School Students in the Capital Love the Motherland
    Universally Recognize the Necessity of Strengthening National Defense and Opposing Aggression
    [Report from this newspaper] Before enrolling in military cadre schools, college and middle school students in the capital underwent more than ten days of full deliberation and in-depth study, and their understanding of participating in national defense construction has been further enhanced. Therefore, student enrollment is extremely enthusiastic.
    Over the past ten days, around the issue of joining military cadre schools, major universities and middle schools have universally launched activities such as studying documents, listening to reports, holding seminars, watching movies, reading literary works, and participating in joint celebrations with the military, on the basis of the past movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.
    Schools universally studied the calls of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Student Federation, General Xiao Hua's special article commemorating the 15th anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement, and this newspaper's editorial on the 1st entitled "The Glorious Post of Patriotic Youth"; they conveyed and discussed the report by Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, on the issue of joining military cadre schools at the Beijing student rally commemorating "December 9th" and "December 1st."
    Universities such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and Normal University, as well as Fu Jen High School, Municipal No. 1 Middle School, Municipal No. 7 Middle School, Girls' No. 4 Middle School, and Yu Ying Middle School, invited responsible persons from military organs to schools to report on the significance of strengthening national defense construction and introduce military life. General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, was successively invited to give lectures at Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and Peking University for several days. Students from Yenching University, Xinsheng Middle School, and other schools held joint celebrations with the People's Liberation Army or invited combat heroes to tell heroic stories from the front lines. On the 14th and 15th, 42 schools, including Normal University, Fu Jen University, Municipal No. 2 Middle School, No. 7 Middle School, Yu Ying School, Beiman School, Finance and Economics School, Beijing Normal School, Datong School, and Industry and Commerce School, invited more than 160 people from the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force to hold seminars at the schools. On the evening of the 16th, more than 300 people from the army, navy, air force, special forces, and young students and workers held a joint evening party at the Youth Palace Friendship Hall. Through these activities, the students increased their understanding and feelings towards military life and further recognized the importance of building a strong national defense army. On the evening of the 9th, more than 300 people from the navy and students held a joint party at the Youth Palace Friendship Hall. After the meeting, the students said one after another: "At the meeting, I really felt the activity and friendliness of the navy comrades." "I must strive to join the navy and not be an expert under the enemy's bayonet!"
    Movies and literary works related to national defense construction or with the theme of navy and air force life were warmly welcomed by students. Schools successively screened famous Soviet films such as "The Azure Road," "Steel Will," and "The Fall of Berlin." Soviet youth heroes such as Kozhedub, Oleg, Matrosov, and Zoya became the goals and role models for students to strive for.
    Various schools also held many small-scale seminars.
    During this period of deliberation, students in various schools further recognized the importance of strengthening national defense construction. Gu Weichang, a student from Municipal No. 8 Middle School, once suspected that strengthening national defense construction contradicted the proposal of universal disarmament. After studying, he figured out this problem. He said: "Arms reduction must be carried out simultaneously by all countries. Now the United States is desperately stepping up its military buildup. If we don't raise our vigilance and strengthen national defense, we will not only fail to defend peace, but we will inevitably suffer losses." Hu Jixian, a student from Tsinghua University, said after watching the film "The Fall of Berlin": The German invaders used a thousand planes to bomb Moscow; but the powerful Soviet Air Force gave a powerful blow, so that not a single German plane could fly in. It can be seen the importance of building an air force. Some students in the school saw the repeated victories of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteer Army, and more or less produced a paralyzing emotion of ignoring the acceleration of national defense construction. After this study, they deeply realized that the crazy American imperialism is making a dying struggle, and we must continue to strengthen our national defense forces so that it dare not take risks easily.
    During this period, students in various schools also focused on resolving the relationship between personal interests and collective interests, and increased their love for the motherland. They deeply realized that strengthening national defense is to protect themselves; if the country has no future, individuals have no future. Therefore, some students who were initially indifferent to the government's call have now begun to ask to enroll in military schools. Zhang Guanghua, a student from Tsinghua University, and Zhang Zhiguo, a student from Municipal Boys' No. 2 Middle School, were initially reluctant to leave their families. After studying, they all said: It is precisely to protect their own warm family and the families of all Chinese people that they must resolutely sign up to join military schools. Bai Wanqing, a student in the Chinese Literature Department of Peking University, said after listening to General Xiao Hua's report: How small and pitiful it is to consider personal interests before considering the needs of the motherland. Tang Yuqiang of Normal University originally wanted to be a people's teacher. Now he says: In order to protect the millions of people who have the same ideals as me and study and work with peace of mind, I am determined to join a military school and strive to build the national defense strength of the motherland.
    Whether they have signed up or not, after this period of deliberation, the students have gained a deeper understanding of participating in national defense construction and increased their love for the motherland and the people.

    经过充分酝酿和深入学习            
    首都大中学生热爱祖国   
    普遍认清必须加强国防反对侵略
    【本报讯】首都大、中学生在报名参加军事干部学校前，经过了十余日的充分酝酿和深入学习，对参加国防建设，有了进一步的认识，所以报名学生极为踊跃。
    十余日来，围绕着参加军事干部学校问题，各大、中学校在过去抗美援朝运动的基础上，普遍展开了学习文件、听报告、座谈、看电影、阅读文艺作品、与部队联欢等活动。
    各学校普遍地学习了青年团中央和全国学联的号召、萧华将军迎接“一二九”运动十五周年专文和本报一日题为“爱国青年的光荣岗位”的社论；传达并讨论了青年团中央副书记蒋南翔在北京市学生纪念“一二·九”、“一二·一”大会上关于参加军事干部学校问题的报告。
    北京、清华、燕京、师范等大学、辅仁附中、市立一中、市立七中、女四中、育英等中学，纷纷请军事机关负责人到学校报告加强国防建设的意义，并介绍部队生活。人民革命军事委员会总政治部副主任萧华将军连日相继被邀请到清华、燕京、北大讲演。燕京大学、新生中学等校学生分别和解放军联欢，或邀请战斗英雄讲述前线上的英勇故事。十四日、十五日两天，师大、辅大及市立二中、七中、育英、贝满、财经、北师、大同、工商等四十二个学校，分别请解放军陆、海、空军一百六十余人到校举行座谈。十六日晚，陆、海、空、军特种部队和青年学生、工人三百余人，在青年宫交谊厅举行联欢晚会。通过这些活动，使学生们增加了对部队生活的了解和感情，进一步认识了建设强大国防军的重要性。九日晚，海军、学生三百余人，在青年宫交谊厅举行了一个联欢会。会后学生们纷纷说：“会上我真感到了海军同志的活跃和可亲。”“我一定要争取参加海军，不做敌人刀尖下的专家！”
    有关国防建设或以海军、空军生活为主题的电影与文艺作品，受到学生们热烈欢迎。各校纷纷放映“蔚蓝色的道路”、“钢铁意志”、“攻克柏林”等苏联著名影片。阔日杜布、奥列格、马特勒索夫、丹娘等苏联青年英雄，成为学生们意想中努力的目标和学习的榜样。
    各学校并举行了多次小型座谈会。
    在这个酝酿期间，各校学生进一步认识了加强国防建设的重要性。市立第八中学学生顾伟昌曾怀疑加强国防建设是否与普遍裁军的主张相矛盾。经过学习以后，他想通了这个问题。他说：“裁减军备必须各国同时进行。现在美国拚命加紧整军，我们若是不提高警惕，加强国防，不但不能保卫和平，反而非吃亏不可。”清华大学学生胡继先看了“攻克柏林”影片以后说：德寇用一千架飞机去轰炸莫斯科；但强大的苏联空军给予了有力的打击，使一架德机也没能飞进去。可见建设空军的重要了。该校有一部分学生看到朝鲜人民军和中国志愿部队屡战屡捷，曾或多或少产生了漠视加速国防建设的麻痹情绪。经过这次学习后，他们深刻地了解到：疯狂的美帝国主义正在作垂死的挣扎，我们必须继续增强国防力量，使它不敢轻易来冒险。
    各校学生在这期间还着重解决了个人利益与集体利益的关系问题，增加了对祖国的热爱。他们深刻地认识了加强国防就是保卫自己；国家没有前途，个人就没有前途。因此，某些最初对于政府号召不关心的学生，现在也开始要求报名参加军事学校。清华大学学生张广华、市立男二中学生张治国等最初都舍不得离开家庭。经过学习后，他们都表示：正是为了保护自己的温暖的家庭和全中国人民的家庭，就要坚决报名参加军事学校。北京大学中国文学系学生白婉清在听过萧华将军的报告后表示：我们不先考虑祖国的需要，而先考虑个人的兴趣，这是多么渺小而可怜的想法。师范大学汤毓强原来一心想做一个人民的教师，现在他说：为了保卫千千万万个与我有同样理想的人安心学习和工作，我决心参加军事学校，为建设祖国的国防力量而奋斗。
    无论报了名或没有报名的学生，经过这个期间的酝酿，都对参加国防建设有了进一步的认识，对祖国和人民增加了热爱。
