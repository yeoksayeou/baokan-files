    U.S. Reactionary Ringleader Hoover's Speech in Full

    Former U.S. President, Republican reactionary ringleader, and long-time enemy of peace and democracy, Hoover, delivered a radio address in New York on December 20th. The full text is as follows:

    I have received hundreds and thousands of requests asking me to give an estimate of the current situation and to express my conclusions on our country's policies. I speak with a deep sense of responsibility. And as I speak tonight, like every American, I am concerned for the American men fighting and dying on the battlefields for the cause of peace and the glory of our country. In a turbulent world, no final assessment of the world situation can be made. However, in order to find our way, we must constantly examine where we have arrived and continuously revise our direction. I do not advocate that we proceed along the current disastrous path, which has led us to where we are now. We can first survey the world's military situation. Today, there is only one center of aggression on Earth. This is the vast landmass of Asia and Europe controlled by the Communists, with a population of 800 million. They probably possess over 300 well-trained and equipped combat divisions, over 30,000 tanks, 10,000 tactical aircraft, and a large number of reserves that can be deployed within 90 days. But they are not powerful maritime nations. Their long-range air force is also limited. These large groups of over 30 different ethnic groups will one day disintegrate. But in the meantime, they are cannon fodder. Facing this threat in the East are about 100 million non-Communist island peoples of Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Korea. Except for Korea (which I will discuss later), they probably have 12 elite combat divisions, with almost no tanks, air force, or navy. Opposite this vast landmass to the south are the East Indies and the Middle East, with about 600 million non-Communist people. In North Africa and Latin America, there are about 150 million non-Communist people. Except for Turkey and Taiwan, these 850 million people have little military strength they are willing or able to contribute, but they can provide important economic and moral strength. Facing this threat, on the European continent, are about 160 million non-Communist people, with fewer than 20 currently available combat divisions, few tanks, few air force or navy, excluding Spain. However, their will to defend themselves is weak, and their disunity is obvious. At this moment, of significant military importance is the British Commonwealth, with a population of 150 million, possessing approximately 30 armed combat divisions, a superior navy, a considerable number of air force, and some tanks. And in the United States, there are 150 million people, prepared to establish a huge air and naval force with 3.5 million personnel, and about 30 well-equipped combat divisions. If we measure these actual military forces today, we must draw certain basic conclusions. (A) We must face the fact that a land war with the Communist continent, using the scarce ground forces of non-Communist countries, will be a war without hope of victory, a war without a victorious political outcome. Any attempt to invade the Communist continent through the quagmire of China, India, or Western Europe is sheer folly. That will be the tomb of millions of American men and will eventually exhaust this Gibraltar of Western civilization. Even if Western Europe is armed far beyond any proposed plan, we will never reach Moscow. Germany, with an army of 240 combat divisions and a powerful air force and tank force, still failed. (B) Similarly, we Americans alone can control the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans with our navy and air force, making it impossible for Communist forces to invade the Western Hemisphere. They cannot reach Washington in large numbers just as we cannot reach Moscow. (C) In this military aspect, we must recognize that the atomic bomb is far from the absolute weapon it was once imagined to be. (D) Obviously, the United States in Korea has been inevitably defeated by the aggression of Communist China. There are not enough troops in the world to repel them. Even if we sacrifice more American men to defend the bridgehead, we know that we will not currently accomplish the mission entrusted to us by the 50 member states of the United Nations. We might as well further explore the situation in the United States. The 150 million American people have already been economically exhausted by government spending. It must be remembered that we are bearing the heavy burden of previous wars, including responsibilities to veterans, and $260 billion in public debt and currency issued during those wars. In the 1952 fiscal year, federal and local spending may exceed $90 million (as in original text - translator). This exceeds all our savings. We must rely on the government to issue more banknotes to make up for the huge deficit. Inflation has already begun, but we may avoid economic disintegration on this scale in these few years by using severe measures. If we continue on this path for a long time, the world's only center of resistance will collapse in economic disaster. We can assess the diplomatic front. Our great hope lies in the United Nations. We witness the primary purpose of the United Nations, to defend peace, being undermined. Until last week, the United Nations had been a platform for constant defamation of our honor, our ideals, and our purposes. It did rally to confront the barbaric aggression in Korea in July. But when it called for military action, the United States had to send more than 90 percent of the foreign troops in Korea, and more than 90 percent of the casualties were Americans. This effort has now been militarily defeated, at least, by the aggression of the Communist bandit army. Whether the United Nations is to be morally defeated, whether its entire moral structure is to suffer collapse, now depends on whether it has the courage to take the following actions: (1) Declare Communist China as an aggressor; (2) Deny this aggressor participation in the United Nations; (3) Demand that all member states of the United Nations cease supplying or transporting to Communist China any materials sufficient to help Communist China fight. This policy, faithfully implemented by non-Communist countries, is not economic sanctions, nor does it require military action. But it will become a great pressure demanding justice. (4) And at the same time, pass a resolution condemning the shameless slanders defaming the United States. Without these, any policy is appeasement. What should our policy be? Now I want to talk about where we should go in the future. Two months ago, I suggested another policy that America could choose to try. This has been supported by a large majority of our press. Since then, the world crisis has become more acute. Obviously, the United Nations has failed in Korea. It is also clear that other non-Communist countries have not or cannot truthfully respond to the United Nations' call to send armed forces to Korea. It is clear that the United Nations cannot mobilize a large number of troops. It is clear that the European continent, in the three years since receiving our assistance, has not formed the consistency and will to gain strength necessary for its own defense. It is clear that our British friends are playing games with appeasing Communist China. It is clear that the United Nations is caught in debate and indecision about appeasement. Expanding on my suggestion from two months ago, I now present certain principles and actions. First, the foundation of our country's policy must be to maintain this Western Hemisphere for the world—the Gibraltar of Western civilization. Second, without a doubt, we can defend the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans with our own air and naval forces, one border in Britain—if it is willing to cooperate—and another border in Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. We can keep our sea supply lines unobstructed. I fervently hope that maximum cooperation can be established between the British Commonwealth and us. Third, for this, we should equip our air force and navy to the fullest extent. We rarely need a large army unless we want to go to Europe or China. We should grant Japan independence and help it defend itself with arms. We should strengthen the defenses of our Pacific borders in Taiwan and the Philippines. We can protect this island of China with our sea and air power. Fourth, after we pay the initial expenses for expanding our air and naval equipment, we can reduce our expenses, balance our budget, and save ourselves from the dangers of inflation and economic deterioration. If we work and sacrifice as the president requires, we can continue to help the world's hungry. With our productivity, we can assist other countries as long as they have demonstrated the spirit and strength to resist Communism. We have a solemn duty to work and sacrifice to do this work. We should abandon appeasement. Morally speaking, Communism cannot be appeased. Appeasement contains more danger than Dunkirk. We don't need another Tehran and Yalta. We can remedy war, but we cannot remedy appeasement. We are grateful that Truman condemned this policy. We cannot ignore the necessity of maintaining Western civilization on the European continent or maintaining our cultural and religious ties with it. But the primary obligation to defend Western Europe on the Western continent rests with the European countries. Whether they have the spiritual strength, the will, and accept their own unification according to their own volition is a test. The United States cannot build spiritual strength for them. We cannot buy this strength with money. You can search through human history and not find a single historical fact to compare with the efforts and sacrifices we have made to uplift their spirit and promote their unity. This effort has failed so far. Their minds have been confused by fear and disunity. Although Spain has the will and ability to fight, they reject it. Although Germany is their border, they haggle over it. They hesitate to believe that the danger they face is still small, hoping to be spared from becoming a battlefield again. Marx has further aggravated their confusion. They are still suffering from war terror. They have highly organized Communists in their country, a threat we must never ignore. In the First and Second World Wars, they—including West Germany—had deployed more than 250 trained and equipped combat divisions on the battlefield within 60 days, and had a powerful air force and navy. They have more manpower and productivity today than in either of the previous two wars. In order for us to give further assistance, they should demonstrate that they have the spiritual strength and unity to utilize their own resources. But this must not only be expressed in conventions, conferences, paper promises, and declarations. Today, this must be expressed in organized and equipped combat divisions, the number of which must be large enough to build a reliable dam to prevent the Communist flood—then we will send a soldier, or send a dollar to their coast. Otherwise, we will be inviting another Korean incident. This will be a disaster for both Europe and America. Our policy in this part of the world should be limited to observation. In difficult times, all Americans have a legitimate demand to strive for unity. Unless unity is based on just principles and actions, it is futile and dangerous. Sincere differences of opinion and sincere debate are not disunity. These are important methods for free people to formulate policies. Clear, straightforward, and open foreign policies must be formulated, so that we have confidence in our own security before we can obtain security. Americans must now pay attention to these bandits in Asia. The policies I have proposed do not constitute isolationism. Indeed, they are the opposite of isolationism. They can avoid recklessly involving our military forces in hopeless wars. They will not allow us to avoid exerting our greatest efforts to work. They will preserve the bulwark of Christian culture in the world against any adventure. According to the policies I have proposed, even without Europe, Americans have no reason to suffer from hysteria or lose confidence in our country's security or future. The future security of mankind depends on the security of America. This may be an unstable peace, but as long as we adopt these policies, even if the Communists attack our maritime defenses, we can continue to maintain such peace indefinitely. We can expect that, at a certain time, the other non-Communist millions of people in the world will rise up against their danger. We can expect that the evil of Communism and the disintegration of its racial control will one day cause it to fall apart on its own. This is scant consolation, but, in world history, Asian nomads have twice swept through most of the world, and their racial conflicts eventually caused their empires to collapse. In the three centuries since we came to this continent, our people have bravely resisted difficulties and misfortunes. We have fearlessly faced our difficulties and have never failed. Even if we have to go it alone, we will not fail this time. But, we need to recognize the entire reality and sharpen our tools to prepare for troubled times. The reality is ugly. We face it with prayer and courage.

    美国反动头子胡佛演说全文
    美国前总统、共和党反动头子、和平民主的老牌敌人胡佛十二月二十日于纽约发表广播演说。全文如下：
    我接到成千成百的要求，要求我对目前局势作一估计，并且对我国政策发表我的结论。我怀着深重的责任感来说话。并且我今晚演说时也和每一个美国人一样，替为了和平的使命和我国的光荣而在作战并且战死沙场的美国男儿忧虑。在动荡的世界中，对世界局势是不能作任何最后估计的。然而，为了要寻找我国的道路，我们必须经常检查我们已经到达了什么地方，并且时时修正我们的方向。我不主张我们沿目前的灾难道路行进，这一道路，已把我们引到了现在的地步。我们可以先综览世界的军事形势。今天在地球上只有一个侵略中心。这就是共产党控制的拥有八亿人民的亚欧大片陆地。他们大概拥有三百多个训练和装备好了的战斗师、三万多辆坦克、一万架战术飞机以及可以在九十天内，投入战斗的大量后备。但他们不是强大的海洋国家。他们的远程空军力量也是有限的。这些三十多个不同类族的大集团有一天将土崩瓦解。但在这期间他们是炮灰。在东边面临这个威胁的，有日本、台湾、菲律宾及朝鲜的约一亿的非共产主义海岛人民。除朝鲜外（我以后将谈到它），他们大概有十二个精锐的战斗师，几乎没有坦克、空军或海军。与这一大片陆地相对峙的，在南面是约有六亿非共产主义人民的东印度群岛和中东。在北非和拉丁美洲，约有一亿五千万非共产主义人民。除了土耳其和台湾之外，这八亿五千万人民很少有他们愿意或者能够拿出来的军事力量，但是他们却能够提供重要的经济与道义力量。在这个威胁面前，在欧洲大陆的战线上，约有一亿六千万非共产主义人民，除了西班牙之外，他们目前可用的作战师不到二十个，很少的坦克，很少的空军或海军。但是，他们保卫自己的意志是薄弱的，他们的不团结是很明显的。此刻在军事上有重要意义的，是有着一亿五千万人民的大英联邦，他们大概有三十个备有武装的作战师，优势的海军，相当数量的空军和一些坦克。而在美国则有一亿五千万人，准备以三百五十万人建立巨大的空海军，约三十装备好了的战斗师。如果我们衡量一下今天的这些实际军事力量，我们就必定得出某些基本结论。（甲）我们必须正视一个事实：以非共产主义国家的稀少的地面军队与这一共产主义大陆进行陆地战争将是一个没有胜利希望的战争，没有胜利的政治结局的战争。经由中国、印度或西欧的泥淖而侵入，从而对共产主义大陆进行战争的任何企图都是纯然的蠢事。那将是数百万美国男儿的坟墓，并且最后会使这一西方文明的直布罗陀精疲力竭。即使把西欧远超过任何拟议中的计划而武装起来，我们也永远到达不了莫斯科。德国拥有一支二百四十战斗师的大军和强大的空军和坦克部队，仍归失败了。（乙）同样地，单单我们美国人，也可以用海军和空军控制大西洋和太平洋，使共产党军队不可能入侵西半球。他们不能大批地到达华盛顿正如我们到不了莫斯科一样。（丙）在这军事方面，我们必须认识到：原子弹远不像一度想像的那样是绝对优越的武器。（丁）很明显，美国在朝鲜是必定已被共产党中国的侵略所击败的了。世界上没有足够的部队来击退他们。即使我们牺牲更多的美国男儿去防守桥头堡，我们知道我们目前不会完成联合国五十个会员国所赋予我们的使命，我们不妨再进一步来探讨美国的情况。一亿五千万美国人民已经在经济上被政府的支出弄得精疲力竭了。必须记住，我们正担负着前几次战争的沉重负担，包括对退伍军人的责任，以及在这些战争中所发的二千六百亿元的公债和通货。在一九五二会计年度中，联邦和地方的支出可能超过九千万元（原文如此——译）。这超过我们全部的储蓄。我们必须靠政府发行更多的钞票来弥补庞大的赤字。通货膨胀已经开始，但我们可能用严厉措施在这很少几年避免发生这种规模的经济解体。如果我们继续长期在这条路上走，世界的唯一抵抗中心便将在经济灾难中崩溃。我们可以估量一下外交阵线。我们很大的希望是在联合国。我们目击联合国的保卫和平的首要目的遭到破坏。直到上一星期为止联合国一直成为不断污蔑我们的荣誉、我们的理想和我们的宗旨的讲坛。它曾振作起来对付七月间在朝鲜的野蛮侵略。但是在它号召采取军事行动的时候，美国却不得不派出百分之九十以上的在朝鲜的外国军队，并且在死伤人数中百分之九十以上是美国人。这种努力现在至少在军事上已被共产党匪军的侵略所击败了。联合国是否要在道义上也被击败，它的整个道义结构是否要遭受崩溃，现在就取决于它是否有勇气采取下述行动：（一）宣布共产党中国为侵略者；（二）拒绝这个侵略者参加联合国；（三）要求联合国一切会员国停止把任何足以帮助共产党中国作战的物资供应共产党中国或向共产党中国运输这种物资。由非共产党国家所忠实执行的这种方针，并不是经济制裁，也不需要采取军事行动。但这将成为要求正义的巨大压力。（四）同时并通过决议，谴责诽谤美国的无耻谰言。如果没有这些，任何方针都是姑息。我们的政策应该怎样呢？现在我要讲一讲我们今后究竟应该往何处去。两个月以前我曾建议过一个可供美国采择试用的另一种政策。这曾得到我们报界中很大多数的赞成。自那以后，世界的危机更趋尖锐。很明显，联合国在朝鲜是失败了。其他的非共产主义国家不曾或不能够真实地响应联合国要求以武装派往朝鲜的号召，这也是很明显的。很明白，联合国动员不了大量的军队。很明白，欧洲大陆在得到我们援助的三年当中并未形成为它自身的防御所必需的那种目的的一致性和取得力量的意志。很明白，我们的英国朋友们正在把姑息共产党中国当作儿戏。很明白，对于姑息与否，联合国陷于辩论和不决之中。把我两月前的建议加以扩充，我现在提出某些原则与行动。第一，我国政策的基础，必须是给世界保持这个西半球——西方文明的直布罗陀。第二，毫无疑问，我们能够以我们自己的空军海军力量守住大西洋和太平洋，一条边界在不列颠——假使它情愿合作的话——另一条边界在日本、台湾、菲律宾。我们能够保持我们的海上供应线畅通无阻。我热烈地希望在大英联邦和我们之间能够建立起最大限度的合作。第三，为此我们就应该把我们的空军与海军极齐全地武装起来。我们很少需要庞大的陆军，除非我们要到欧洲或中国去。我们应该给日本以独立，并且以武装帮助它自卫。我们应该加强我们在台湾与菲律宾的太平洋边界的防务。我们能够以我们的海上和空中的力量来保护中国的这个岛屿。第四，我们为扩充空军与海军装备支付了初步的开支以后，就可以减缩我们的开支，平衡我们的预算并使我们自己免于通货膨胀与经济恶化的危险。如果我们像总统所要求的那样劳作与牺牲，我们就可以继续援助世界的饥民。以我们的生产力，我们可以援助其他的国家，只要它们已经表现出有抵御共产主义的精神与力量。我们有着为做这个工作而努力与牺牲的严正的职责。我们应该抛弃姑息。在道义上说，是不能姑息共产主义的。姑息包含着比敦刻尔克更多的危险。我们不需要再有德黑兰和雅尔达。我们可以补救战争，但我们却无法补救姑息。我们感谢杜鲁门谴责了这种方针。我们不能对保持欧洲大陆的西方文明或者对保持我们在文化与宗教上与它联系的必要性熟视无睹。但是，保卫西方的西欧大陆，主要义务是在欧洲国家的身上。它们是否有精神的力量、意志并按照它们自己的志愿来接受它们自己的统一，便是一种考验了。美国无法为他们建立精神的力量。我们不能用金钱买得这种力量。你翻遍人类历史，也找不到一件史实足以和我们为了振奋他们的精神并促成他们的团结而作的努力和牺牲相比拟。这种努力到如今是失败了。他们的思想已因恐惧和不团结而混乱了。虽然西班牙有战斗的意志和能力，他们却排斥它。虽然德国是他们的边界，他们却和德国斤斤计较。他们踌躇不定地相信他们所受的危险仍然很小，希望得免于再次成为战场。马克思更加重了他们的混乱。他们仍在患着战争恐怖。他们国内有着高度组织起来的共产党，这是我们决不可忽视的威胁。在第一次和在第二次大战中，他们——包括西德在内——曾在六十天以内就将二百五十以上的训练及装配好了的作战师布置在战场上，并且有强大的空军和海军。他们今天拥有的人力和生产力较上两次大战的那一次都多。为了要使我们进一步给予援助，他们应该表现他们有精神上的力量和团结一致来利用他们自己的资源。但是这必须不仅仅表现在公约、会议、纸上诺言和宣言上。今日，这必须表现在有组织有装备的战斗师上，其数目的庞大要足能建立一道防止共产主义洪流的可靠堤防——然后我们才派一个兵，或送一块美元到他们的海岸。否则，我们便将召致另一个朝鲜事件。这对欧洲对美国都将是一个灾难。我们在世界这一部分的政策应该限于观望的阶段。在困难的时候，所有的美国人都有着正当的力求团结的要求。除非团结是根据于正当的原则和行动，否则就是徒劳和危险的事情。真诚的意见分歧和真诚的辩论并不是不团结。这些是自由的人们制订政策的重要方法。必须制定正确明白和公开的外交政策，在我们能够得到安全之前，先使得对我们自己的安全具有信心。美国人目前必须注视到亚洲的这些匪帮。我所提出的这些政策不会构成孤立主义。的确，它们与孤立主义是相反的。它们可避免鲁莽地把我们的军事力量卷入无望的战争中。它们不会使我们得以无须尽最大努力去工作。它们会保存反对任何冒险的世界上基督教文化的堡垒。按照我所提出的政策，即使没有欧洲，美国人也没有理由患歇斯底里症或对于我国的安全或前途丧失信心。人类将来的安全系于美国的安全。这可能是一种不稳定的和平，但是只要我们采取这些政策，即使共产主义者进攻我们在海上的防线，我们仍能无限期地继续保持这样的和平。我们可以指望：在一定的时候，世界上其他非共产主义的千千万万的人民将起而对付他们的危险。我们可以指望：共产主义的罪恶和它的种族控制的解体总有一天会使它自身分崩离析。这是渺茫的慰藉，但是，在世界历史上，亚洲游牧民族曾两次横扫世界大部分地区，而他们的种族倾轧终于使他们的帝国瓦解了。在自从我们到这个大陆上以来的三世纪中，我们的人民曾奋勇抵抗过困难与不幸的境遇。我们曾无畏地面对我们的困难，而从未失败过。即使我们必须匹马单枪地去做，这次我们也不会失败。但是，我们需要认识整个现实，并磨厉以需，对付多难的时代。现实是丑恶的。我们以祈祷与勇气来面对它。
