In our accusation at the United Nations Security Council against the US imperialist aggression against Taiwan, there is ample historical fact and legal document as evidence. The US representative Austin was unable to refute it, therefore he avoided the well-known historical fact that Taiwan belongs to China and the legal basis of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement, and instead talked at length about his so-called US "friendship" towards China. He emphasized that "the friendship of the United States towards China is also manifested in the large amount of economic aid the United States gave to China." He said, "From 1937 until the Japanese surrender, the United States gave China economic aid worth $670 million. After the Japanese surrender, the United States gave another $1 billion in economic aid." In this way, Austin, with the tone of a usurer, attempted to deceive the Chinese and the world's people! As long as we study the process of each loan and its specific content, we can clearly see that the US loans to China were all of a very insidious aggressive nature. It is only because US imperialism is accustomed to using a set of deceptive methods in its Far East policy that every aggressive fact is disguised with the pretense of "friendship."

Analyzing its nature and content, the loans from the United States to the Kuomintang reactionary government during the Anti-Japanese War can be divided into three categories. The first category is the so-called strategic material loans, a total of four:

    I. Tung Oil Loan (designated to be repaid with tung oil) February 8, 1939 $25 million
    II. Tin Loan (designated to be repaid with tin) March 7, 1940 $20 million
    III. Tungsten Ore Loan (designated to be repaid with tungsten) September 25, 1940 $25 million
    IV. Metal Loan (designated to be repaid with tungsten and antimony) December 1, 1940 $50 million

The second category is the Exchange Stabilization Fund Loan December 1, 1940 $50 million

The third category is a credit loan for the purpose of supporting the Kuomintang government's finances February 7, 1942 $500 million

The total of the above six loans is the $670 million that Austin referred to as being loaned to China by the United States "from 1937 until the Japanese surrender." In addition, there was the so-called Sino-American Aviation Company loan of $15 million, with an interest rate of 5%, which was loaned in the name of a private airline, but was actually the US imperialists taking the opportunity to seize China's aviation rights. Austin did not mention it, so we will not go into it further. Let's first talk about the first item, the four strategic material loans, totaling $120 million. These four loans were all given to the Kuomintang government by the US government's Export-Import Bank. The apparent purpose of these loans was to help China in the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, the War of Resistance Against Japan began on July 7, 1937, while the loans were delayed until the end of 1938, after China's wartime capital had already moved to Chongqing. In the first and most difficult year of the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was not the United States but the Soviet Union that provided loans to help China resist Japan. In that short year, the Soviet Union lent China a total of three large loans, worth a total of US$250 million. At that time, many of the planes, tanks, and other military equipment used in the war of resistance came from the Soviet Union. At that time, the United States was still selling large quantities of strategic materials such as steel, oil, and machinery to the Japanese warlords to make huge profits! Everyone knows that from 1937 to 1941, the United States continued to supply Japan with large quantities of munitions under the "cash and carry" act. According to statistics, in 1938 alone, US imports of war materials to Japan accounted for 92% of Japan's total consumption! Mr. Austin, is this a manifestation of friendship towards China?

Historical facts tell us that before the Japanese warlords opened fire on the United States at Pearl Harbor, the focus of US imperialist Far East diplomacy was still on appeasing and appeasing Japan. Dulles admitted in his book "China and America" (published by Princeton University in 1946) that "US-Japan trade was originally more than US-China trade. Later, it increased even more due to the high-profit scrap iron and oil exports to Japan. Therefore, many people realize that this cannot be interpreted as any anti-Japanese action. Some even argue that Japanese control of East Asia would make it lawful and stable there. Therefore, it can increase US trade with China; this is beneficial to the United States." (Original book, pages 208-209). It can be seen here that the United States was unwilling and did not really help China before being hit at Pearl Harbor. Therefore, in the first year and a half of China's War of Resistance, the United States, on the one hand, actually did profitable strategic material business with Japan, and on the other hand, stood by and did not express any willingness to help China. It was not until after the fall of Wuhan in October 1938 that the United States became anxious, fearing that Japan's monopoly of China would be detrimental to the future of US expansion in the Far East, so it wanted to stabilize the Kuomintang regime to contain Japan. At the same time, the US imperialists also wanted to take this opportunity to obtain China's strategic materials. Under such circumstances, the US imperialists agreed on December 13, 1938 to lend China a mere $25 million, which is only one-tenth of the Soviet loan. This was the first loan to the United States during the War of Resistance. The actual situation is that the US government displayed its usurious style, taking advantage of China's financial difficulties under the duress of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang officials' fear of foreigners and flattery; seizing this weakness, it gave very harsh loan conditions. At the beginning of the negotiations, it step by step forced the Chinese representatives who were negotiating the loan to urge the Kuomintang government to provide materials on China's strategic material reserves, production, trade, and transportation; its attempt to take this opportunity to control China's strategic materials was obvious. The first loan was designated to be repaid with tung oil. Then, in the form of the second, third, and fourth loans, most of China's famous strategic materials, such as tungsten, tin, and antimony, were placed under the control of the US imperialists. In particular, tungsten and antimony are essential alloy raw materials for making hard steel for guns and cannons. China is the most important source of reserves and production of these two minerals. China's antimony production accounts for 60% of the world's total production, and tungsten production accounts for 30% of the world's total production. The US imperialists attempted to gain control over these materials. These loans were the first step in implementing this policy. Seeing that in the "Sino-US Bilateral Economic Aid Agreement" signed on July 3, 1948, it further obtained the priority right to purchase China's strategic materials in the articles, one can know that the US imperialist economic aggression policy was deliberate and had a long-term plan.

If we further study the relationship between the materials purchased with these loans and the US monopoly capitalists and their running dog politicians, we can also see another aspect of the aggression of the loans. We will only give one example here. A large part of the tung oil loan was intended to be used to buy trucks for transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road. Therefore, the monopoly capitalists who controlled truck production were the most enthusiastic in promoting this loan. Their purpose was to use the loan to do more business in China and expand the US automobile market in China. However, when the loan bill was sent to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, there were many opponents, and many senators were afraid of offending Japan, so they hesitated about the attitude towards the loan to China, which was resisting Japan. At that time, the person in charge of the Automobile Industry Association in Detroit, the center of the automobile industry, immediately notified Senator Vandenberg, a famous senator stationed in Washington, by long-distance telephone to find a way. Vandenberg was the senator of Michigan, where Detroit is located, and was actually the spokesman for the automobile industry monopoly capitalists in the parliament. Since his big boss had given the order, he naturally worked hard to lobby, and thus the tung oil loan bill was successfully passed in the US Congress!

Because the main purpose of these loans from the US imperialists to the Kuomintang reactionary government was to control China's strategic materials and occupy China's market, when negotiating, they not only insisted on using the shipment of strategic materials to the United States as a repayment method, but also strictly stipulated the quantity, time, and specific transportation routes and methods for transporting the designated strategic materials to the United States, and also detailed the conditions and procedures for purchasing materials in the United States. In order to ensure the smooth completion of this task, the tung oil loan agreement stipulated that the Kuomintang government establish an import and export trade company in New York, called the World Trading Corporation (or translated as the Global Trading Corporation). The funds were paid by the Fuxing Company, which was then the state-owned trading organization of the Kuomintang government but was actually controlled by Kong Xiangxi. However, the World Trading Corporation was legally an American company registered in New York State. The general manager was Mr. Lahead, who had just resigned from the US Treasury Department. The loan agreement stipulated that the payment of the loan, the business of purchasing materials with the loan, and the business of purchasing and transporting strategic materials from China to the United States for sale and using the proceeds to repay the loan principal and interest must be handled by this company. Because of this relationship, during the War of Resistance, most of China's tung oil export business was monopolized by this company. Later, the World Trading Corporation developed into one of the main procurement agencies of the Kuomintang government in the United States, and also acted as an import and export trade manager for other private clients. In its actual sense, the World Company was part of the US imperialist loan conspiracy; they attempted to establish an international trade organization controlled by them, on the one hand to ensure that strategic materials were shipped to the United States on schedule and continuously, and on the other hand attempted to control at least a certain part of China's foreign trade through this company, especially the state-owned foreign trade business of the Kuomintang government. Only by explaining these specific circumstances can we fully understand the insidious plans of imperialist economic aggression!

The above-mentioned four loans, in the name of "economic aid," actually had very high interest rates. The interest rate of the tung oil loan was 4.5% per annum. The tin loan was 4%, and the interest rate of other loans was never lower than 4%. According to the records of the Kuomintang Central Bank at the end of 1948, the principal of these loans, except for very small odd amounts, had been paid off. In other words, the strategic materials designated in the loan agreement for repayment have all been delivered to the US imperialists. As of December 31, 1948, China had paid a total of more than US$15.7 million in interest to the US imperialists! Austin and his ilk refer to this kind of "economic aid" as "friendship" towards China, which is a typical attempt by usurers to seize both "fame and profit"!

Following the four strategic material loans, the next loan from the US imperialists to the Kuomintang reactionary government during the War of Resistance Against Japan was the second item, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Loan. The nature and application of this loan were different from those of the strategic material loans, but its aggressive content was the same. This method of aggression had been tried in several countries in South and Central America, such as Mexico and Cuba, before it was applied to China. The source of the loan was the US$2 billion that the US imperialists "earned" when the US dollar depreciated in 1933. The method was to allocate US$50 million of it to the account of the "China Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee" at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The United Kingdom contributed £5 million (worth about US$20 million at the exchange rate at that time), and the Kuomintang's "National Banks" (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China) also contributed US$20 million; the total was US$90 million in the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The Exchange Stabilization Fund is the main tool for controlling the external price of a country's currency and is a very powerful weapon for implementing financial policy. In principle, it should be controlled by the Ministry of Finance or the National Bank. However, although the Kuomintang reactionary government respected the US imperialists as the supreme emperor, the US imperialists still did not believe that those running dogs could effectively implement their policies. Therefore, they thought of a way to directly control China's financial policy. That was to organize an Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee directly participated in by representatives of the US and British Treasuries. The committee consisted of five members. The loan agreement stipulated that one of the members must be an American, recommended by the US Secretary of the Treasury, and could not be removed from office without the consent of the US Secretary of the Treasury (Article 1 of the Sino-US Exchange Stabilization Fund Agreement). Another member must be a British, recommended by the British Treasury, and could not be removed from office without the consent of the British Treasury (Article 5 of the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Agreement). These two members were nominally appointed by the Kuomintang government, but were actually representatives of the US and British Treasuries. The other three Chinese members were one from the Kong faction, one from the Song faction, and one representative figure from the Chinese commercial banking community. According to the agreement (Article 1 of the Sino-US Agreement), the Kuomintang reactionary government not only authorized this committee with full power to manage and use this US$90 million Exchange Stabilization Fund to maintain the exchange rate between the legal tender and the US dollar, but also stipulated that all other Exchange Stabilization Funds could also be handed over to the committee for management and use.

According to the publicly disclosed agreement on the surface, the US and British governments have already used this loan to establish an agency in China that is directly participated in by representatives of their finance ministries to manage foreign exchange and implement foreign exchange policies. The loss of sovereignty and humiliation of the country is already serious enough. But the reality is more than that. When signing the Exchange Stabilization Fund Agreement, Song Ziwen, the representative of the Kuomintang reactionary government, also signed a secret exchange of notes. According to the contents of the exchange of notes: The Kuomintang government promised to establish an agency and give it full power to manage and control all the foreign exchange funds of the Chinese government and the Central Bank other than the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The powers granted to this agency will include inspection, management, and prohibition of any foreign exchange transactions, as well as the import and export of gold, silver, and other precious metals, and will include forcing the government to purchase all foreign exchange and gold and silver and forcing the people in China to provide information and materials related to the implementation of the above-mentioned powers, and so on. What is most noteworthy is that the agency with such great power, although nominally composed of the "Chinese government," is actually directly controlled by the US Treasury Department. Because the exchange of notes stipulates that the three Chinese members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee jointly formed by China, Britain, and the United States serve as ex officio members of this new agency. At the same time, it is stipulated that the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee with US and British members can learn about the policies of the new agency through the contact of Chinese members and make suggestions to the new agency. The exchange of notes also stated that the "Chinese government" will do everything possible to assist the US members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee in obtaining information about the work of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and the new agency. In the autumn of 1941, the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance established a Foreign Exchange Management Committee, which obtained great powers as described in the exchange of notes. At that time, many people in Chongqing did not understand and felt that it was redundant. Because the Kuomintang Ministry of Finance had a Currency Department and already had a Foreign Exchange Examination Committee, and the "Central Bank" had a Business Bureau, all of which were agencies responsible for managing financial policies, why add a Foreign Exchange Management Committee? Little did they know that this was an agency for US imperialists to steal China's foreign financial power. Its establishment was entirely to fulfill the secret exchange of notes. This is a big wolf introduced into China by the Exchange Stabilization Fund loan.

In the actual historical development, neither the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee nor the Foreign Exchange Management Committee played the expected role, because shortly after the establishment of these two agencies, the Pacific War began, and China's coast was completely blockaded by Japan. At that time, China's foreign trade routes were only the extremely difficult Yunnan-Burma Road and airplanes. International trade was limited to a very few speculators and adventurers. Since international trade had shrunk so much, foreign exchange business also decreased accordingly. At that time, the US imperialists' focus was on militarily and politically supporting Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime. After the Southern Anhui Incident, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime was gradually completely controlled by the US imperialists. Since it could control the entire Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime, it could use other methods to control China's financial finances, and these two agencies were no longer needed. Therefore, in April 1944, one year before the expiration of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, the agreement was terminated. Although the US Exchange Stabilization Fund loan was 50 million, only one-fifth of it was used; when it was terminated, the principal and interest were paid off, and the unused amount was cancelled. The two agencies, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and the Foreign Exchange Management Committee, which were produced by the agreement, also died one after another. The Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee started its business on August 13, 1941. Its business greatly decreased after the Pearl Harbor incident on December 8 of the same year. In these mere three months, the focus of its business was to supply foreign exchange to importers in Shanghai and other treaty ports (mainly Shanghai) at official prices lower than market prices. At that time, foreign merchants still controlled nine out of ten of China's import and export trade, so in fact, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee's cheap foreign exchange mostly subsidized foreign merchants, especially merchants from US and British imperialist countries. During this period, the US and British members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee actually played a big role. The US loan component in the Exchange Stabilization Fund was the largest, so the US member had the most say. If the Pacific War had not cut off his opportunity to operate, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and its sister agency, the Foreign Exchange Management Committee, would have played a large controlling role in China's foreign exchange and trade policies.

Finally, let's talk about the third item, the US$500 million credit loan in 1942. As mentioned above, after the Pearl Harbor incident, China's seaports were blockaded by Japan, international trade was almost zero, materials could not be shipped in large quantities, and foreign exchange could not play any role. So why was there a US$500 million credit loan on February 7, 1942? Think about the international and domestic situation at that time! After the Southern Anhui Incident, the Kuomintang government actually stopped using troops against Japan and instead actively attacked the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which were truly resisting Japan. However, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime believed that the signboard of resisting Japan was still useful to him, so he refused to give it up. After the Pearl Harbor incident, Chiang knew that the United States was in a dilemma, so he took advantage of the signboard of resisting Japan to extort "US aid" as much as possible to strengthen his struggle against communism. The Kuomintang government's finances at that time were already at the end of their rope, and the legal tender had inflated to the point of collapse, so it urgently sought US dollars from the United States in order to save its increasingly difficult finances.

The United States' international policy at that time was also developing in contradiction. On the one hand, Japan was attacking it, and it had to resist Japan. At the same time, it was reluctant to open up a second battlefield in Europe, watching the Soviet Union resist the fascist German attack alone. In the Far East, the United States, on the one hand, was unwilling to support the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which were truly resisting Japan, but at the same time, it needed to show its support for China's War of Resistance at the most critical time. However, due to the blockade, even with loans, it was impossible to ship in large quantities of materials. Therefore, this loan could not be used reasonably. The result was that it filled the bottomless pit of Kuomintang officials' corruption and wealth. Among them, US$200 million was used as collateral for US public bonds and US dollar savings bonds. US$220 million was used to buy gold in the United States and ship it back to China for sale. It was said to be to withdraw legal tender, but in reality, it created a great opportunity for the four major families and their running dogs to make a fortune! They bought US public bonds at very cheap official exchange rates; even most of the US public bonds were "distributed" internally before they were issued. When going abroad, they were taken out in boxes, seeking to cash them in foreign banks and deposit them in foreign banks! As for buying gold at low prices, it repeatedly led to stinking gold corruption cases, which were well known to the people of the whole country. In addition, US$55 million of the US$500 million loan was spent on printing banknotes in the United States, which can be said to be the cost of inflation; there were also many banknote printing kickbacks, which were swallowed by the four major families! Of the US$500 million, only a pitiful US$25 million was used to purchase textiles, and the four major families also made a lot of money from this batch of cotton cloth!

It can be seen from this that the US$500 million loan from the United States was actually equivalent to spending a large sum of money and handing it over to the four major families. The agreement for this loan did not specifically stipulate the method of repaying the principal and interest, but only said that the method of repayment would be agreed upon by both parties after the war depending on the situation at that time! This statement seems to be very generous on the surface, but in reality, the conditions are very harsh! Because the method of repaying the principal and interest was not specifically stipulated; it later became an unlimited condition. It's like a knife hanging over the debtor's head, making the debtor constantly threatened!

What has been discussed above is the loan during the War of Resistance, which is the US$670 million mentioned by Austin. Each of them clearly contains aggressive content. However, because China and the United States were allies in the War of Resistance Against Japan, their intention to invade China was not very clear. In the later period of the War of Resistance, especially because of the blockade, the United States' policy of economic aggression against China did not have much opportunity for great development. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the situation was very different! On the one hand, China's democratic revolutionary forces have been greatly enhanced, and the Chinese people's liberation movement has made rapid progress. On the other hand, the speed of the collapse of the rule of the four major families has greatly increased. At the same time, without the Japanese invaders' blockade, the sea ban was lifted, and sea transportation was greatly opened, allowing American merchants to directly enter and occupy the Chinese market! This objective situation has made US imperialists politically and militarily more actively support Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime against the Chinese people, and economically further blatantly seize China's economic lifeline and carry out aggression in big steps. At the same time, because the Chinese people have gradually seen through the conspiracy of the US imperialists, anti-American sentiment has increased, so the US imperialists have also done some so-called "relief" work after the war in an attempt to play a deceptive role. All the loans and grants after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, including the "additional US$1 billion" mentioned by Austin, were attempts to achieve these goals.

    抗战时期美国对华“经济援助”的侵略内容
    超定
    我国在联合国安理会对于美帝侵略台湾的控诉，是有充分的历史事实与法律文件的根据。美国代表奥斯汀无法辩驳，因此避开人所周知的台湾属于中国的历史事实与开罗宣言及波茨坦协定的法律根据，而大谈特谈他所谓美国对华的“友谊”。他强调的指出“美国对中国的友谊也表现在美国给中国的大量经济援助”。他说“自一九三七年到日本投降时止，美国给与中国的经济援助价值六亿七千万美元。日本投降后，美国又给了另外十亿美元的经济援助”。这样，奥斯汀以高利贷者惯用的口吻，企图欺骗中国及世界人民！我们只要研究一下逐笔借款的经过和他的具体内容，便可以很明显地看出美国对华的贷款都是带有很阴险的侵略性的。只是因为美帝国主义在远东政策上用惯了一套欺骗的手法，所以，每件侵略的事实都穿上了“友谊”的伪装。
    就其性质与内容分析，抗日时期美国对国民党反动政府的借款可以分为三项。第一项即所谓战略物资借款，共四笔如下：
    一、桐油借款（指定以桐油归还）一九三九年二月八日  二千五百万美元
    二、锡借款（指定以锡归还）一九四○年三月七日  二千万美元
    三、钨砂借款（指定以钨归还）一九四○年九月二十五日  二千五百万美元
    四、金属借款（指定以钨锑归还）一九四○年十二月一日  五千万美元
    第二项为平准基金借款  一九四○年十二月一日五千万美元
    第三项为以支持国民党政府财政为目的之信用借款  一九四二年二月七日五亿美元
    以上六笔借款总数就是奥斯汀所说的“自一九三七年到日本投降止”美国借与中国的六亿七千万美元。此外还有所谓中美航空公司借款一千五百万美元，利息五厘，乃是以私人航空公司名义借给的，实际上也是美帝借机攫取中国航空权的。奥斯汀没有提及，我们也就不再去说它了。我们先谈第一项四笔战略物资借款，总共一亿二千万美元。这四笔都是由美国政府的进出口银行借给国民党政府的。这些借款表面上的目的是帮助中国抗日战争。但是抗日战争开始在一九三七年七月七日而借款却迟至一九三八年年底，当中国战时首都已迁到重庆以后。在抗日战争开始的第一年，最困难的时候，借款帮助中国抗日的，不是美国而是苏联。在这短短的一年内苏联一共借给中国三笔大借款，共值美金二亿五千万元。当时抗日所用的飞机坦克以及其他军器很多是从苏联来的。那时美国还正以大量钢铁石油机械等战略物资卖给日本军阀以谋厚利呢！世人皆知自一九三七年到一九四一年期间，美国在“现购”“自运”法案下还是继续供给日本大批军火。据统计，即就一九三八年一年说，美国输日作战物资即占日本全部消耗额的百分之九十二！奥斯汀先生，难道这是对中国友谊的表现么？
    历史的事实告诉我们，日本军阀在珍珠港向美国开火以前，美帝远东外交政策的重点还是在姑息及拉拢日本。杜洛史在他的《中国与美国》（一九四六年普林斯顿大学出版）一书中招认说：“日美贸易本较中美贸易为多。后来又因有厚利的废铁及石油输日，更为增多。因此很多人认识这不能解释为反日的任何行动。甚至于有人主张日本控制东亚会使那里守法及安定。因此可以增加美国对华贸易；这样对美国是有利的。”（原书二○八至二○九页）。这里可以看出美国在珍珠港挨打以前是不愿意而且没有真正援助中国的。所以我国抗战开始的一年半中，美国一方面实际上和日本做有厚利的战略物资生意，一方面袖手旁观，对中国未作任何帮助的表示。待一九三八年十月武汉失守以后，美国才着急了，怕日本独霸中国后不利于美国在远东扩张的前途，因此想稳定国民党政权来牵制日本。同时美帝也要借着这个机会来取得中国的战略物资。在这样的情况之下，美帝于一九三八年十二月十三日应允借给中国区区二千五百万美元，只等于苏联借款的十分之一。这是抗战期间第一笔向美国的借款。实际情形是美国政府拿出他十足的高利贷者的作风，利用中国那时在日寇大军强逼下的财政困难情况以及国民党官僚们惧外媚外的心理；抓住了这种弱点，给了很苛刻的借款条件。交涉一开始，便一步进一步的逼着中国商谈借款的代表向国民党政府催索中国战略物资蕴藏，生产，贸易以及运输情况的材料；其想借此机会控制中国战略物资的企图，已昭然若揭。第一次借款是指定以桐油来还本的。接着便以第二，第三，第四笔借款的方式把中国著名的战略物资钨、锡、锑等大部都放在美帝控制之下了。尤其是钨和锑，是制造枪炮用的硬钢所必需的合金原料。中国是这两种矿物蕴藏及生产最重要的源泉，中国锑的生产占世界总生产的百分之六十，钨的生产占世界总生产的百分之三十。美帝企图取得对这种物资的控制权。这些借款是执行这个政策的第一步。看他后来在一九四八年七月三日所签定的“中美双边经济援助协定”中更进一步的在条文中取得购买中国战略物资的优先权，便可知美帝这种经济侵略政策是处心积虑，有长期计划的了。
    我们再研究一下运用这些借款所购买的物资与美国独占资本家以及其走狗政客们的关系，也可以看出借款的侵略性的另一方面。我们这里只举一个例子。桐油借款的一大部分是准备用来买大卡车以供滇缅公路上运输之用的。所以推动这笔借款最热心的就是控制卡车生产的独占资本家。他们的目的是利用借款在中国多做生意，扩大对中国的美国汽车的市场。但是当借款法案送到美国参议院外交委员会的时候，反对的人颇多，很多参议员怕得罪日本，所以对于对抗日的中国的借款的态度，迟疑不决。当时汽车工业中心城市底特律的汽车同业公会的负责人，即刻以长途电话通知驻在华盛顿的著名参议员范登堡设法。范氏是底特律所在地的密执安州的参议员，实际上即是汽车业独占资本家在议会里的代言人。他的大老板既然下了命令，他当然努力活动，这样，桐油借款法案便在美国议会里顺利的通过了！
    因为美帝借给国民党反动政府这几笔款的主要目的是控制中国的战略物资与占领中国的市场，所以在交涉的时候，不止坚持要拿运送战略物资去美国作为还本方法，而且极严格地规定了将所指定的战略物资运往美国的数量、时间以及具体的运输路线及办法，同时也详细地规定了在美购买物资的条件与手续。为了保证顺利地完成这种任务，在桐油借款协定中规定由国民党政府在纽约建立一个进出口贸易公司，叫做世界贸易公司（或译为环球贸易公司）。资金由当时国民党政府的国营贸易机构而实为孔祥熙所控制的复兴公司的名义支付的。但是世界贸易公司在法律上是纽约州注册的美国公司。总经理为甫由美国财政部辞职的拉海德氏。借款协定中规定借款的支付，用借款采购物资的业务以及由中国购运战略物资赴美出售并以出售所得之款归还借款本息的业务，皆须由这个公司经办。因为这种关系，在抗日时期，中国桐油出口的业务大半为这个公司所独占。后来世界贸易公司发展成了国民党政府主要的驻美采购机构之一，同时也代理其他私营客户经理进出口贸易。就其实际意义上说，世界公司就是美帝国主义借款阴谋的一部分；他们企图建立一个由他们控制的国际贸易机构，一方面保证战略物资的按期源源不绝地运往美国，一方面企图经过这个公司至少可以控制中国一定部分的对外贸易，尤其是国民党政府的国营对外贸易业务，只有说明这些具体情况才更能充分了解帝国主义经济侵略的阴谋毒计的！
    以上所述的四笔借款，美其名曰“经济援助”，实际上利息很高。桐油借款的利息是年利四厘半（即百分之四点五）。锡借款为四厘，其他借款亦从未低过四厘。根据一九四八年年底国民党中央银行的纪录，这些借款的本金，除很微小的尾数外，都已还清了。换句话说，就是借款协定中所指定还本的战略物资都已运交美帝了。到一九四八年十二月三十一日为止，中国总共付交美帝一千五百七十余万美元的利息！奥斯汀之流拿这种“经济援助”指为对华“友谊”，真是典型的企图攫取“名利两收”的高利贷者！
    抗日时期美帝对国民党反动政府借款中，接着四笔战略物资借款而来的就是第二项的平准基金借款。这笔借款的性质与运用方法与战略物资借款不同，然其侵略的内容则是一样的。这种侵略的方式在没有应用到中国以前，在南中美洲几个国家如墨西哥及古巴都试用过。借款的来源是美帝于一九三三年美金贬值时所“赚”得的二十亿美元。方法是将其中的五千万美元拨到纽约联邦准备银行“中国平准基金委员会”的账上。英国凑了五百万镑（按当时汇率约值二千万美元），国民党的“国家银行”（中、中、交、农）也凑了二千万美元；总共是九千万美元的平准基金。平准基金是掌握一国货币对外价格的主要工具，是执行金融政策很有力的武器，按理是应当由财政部或国家银行掌握的。但是国民党反动政府虽尊美帝如太上皇，美帝仍是不相信那些走狗能有效地执行他们的政策。因此想了一个直接控制中国金融政策的方式。那便是组织了一个由美英财政部代表直接参加的平准基金委员会。该委员会由五个委员组成。借款协定中规定其中一个委员须是美国人，由美国财政部部长推荐，而且非经美国财政部部长同意不能去职（中美平准基金协定第一条）。其中另一个委员须是英国人，由英国财政部推荐，也非经英国财政部同意不能去职（中英平准基金协定第五条）。这两个委员名义上是国民党政府指派的，实际上是美英财政部的代表。其他三个中国人的委员，一个是孔系的人，一个是宋系的人，一个是中国商业银行界的代表人物。根据协定（中美协定第一条）国民党反动政府不止将管理运用这九千万美元平准基金以维持法币及美元的汇价的全权授给了这个委员会，并且还规定可以将其他一切的平准基金也交给该委员会管理及运用。
    就表面上公开的协定看，美英政府已经利用了这笔借款在中国建立起由他们财政部代表直接参加的管理外汇及执行外汇政策的机构。丧权辱国，已经够厉害了。实际上还不止此。签订平准基金协定的时候，国民党反动政府的代表宋子文还签订了一个秘密的换文。据换文内容：国民党政府，承允建立一个机构并予以全权管理与控制中国政府及中央银行的一切除平准基金以外的外汇基金。这样授予这个机构的权力将包括检查、管理，及禁止任何外汇交易，以及金银等贵金属的进口与出口，并包括强制由政府征购一切外汇与金银及强制中国境内人民供给有关施行上列权力的情报与资料等等。最值得注意的是拥有这样大的权力的机构，名义上虽由“中国政府”组成，实际上却是等于直接的受美国财政部的控制。因为换文中规定由中英美合组的平准基金委员会中的三个中籍委员担任这个新的机构的当然成员。同时并规定有美英委员参加的平准基金委员会得经由中籍委员之联系而知晓新机构之政策并得向新机构提出建议。换文中并申明“中国政府”将尽一切可能协助平准基金委员会的美籍委员取得有关平准会及新机构工作之情报。一九四一年秋国民党财政部成立了一个外汇管理委员会，该会获得如换文中所述的很大的权力。当时重庆很多人不了解，觉得是多此一举。因为国民党财政部有钱币司并已经有了一个外汇审核委员会“中央银行”有业务局都是以管理金融政策为专责的机构，为何又加上一个外汇管理委员会？殊不知这是美国帝国主义者独力窃取中国对外金融大权的机构。他的成立完全是为了履行秘密换文。这是平准基金借款引进中国来的一只大狼。
    在实际历史的发展上，平准基金委员会及外汇管理委员会都没有起预期的作用，因为这两个机构成立后不久，太平洋战事便开始了，中国的海岸也完全被日本封锁了。那时中国对外贸易的道路只有十分难走的滇缅公路及飞机。国际贸易只限于极少数的投机冒险分子。国际贸易既然如此地缩小了，外汇业务也随之减少了。当时美帝的视线集中在军事上及政治上扶植蒋介石的反动政权。在皖南事变以后蒋介石反动政权逐渐地完全为美帝所控制，他既然能够左右整个的蒋介石反动政权，就可以用别的方法去控制中国的金融财政，这两个机构亦就用不着了。所以在一九四四年四月，在平准基金期满的前一年就将该协定结束了。美国平准基金贷款虽是五千万，实只动用了五分之一；结束时本息还清，未动用的也就取消了。由该协定所产生的两个机构平准基金委员会及外汇管理委员会，也就先后寿终正寝了。平准基金委员会是在一九四一年八月十三日开始业务的。到同年十二月八日珍珠港事变后业务便大减少了。在这区区三个余月当中，他的业务的重心是以低于市价的官价供给外汇给上海及其他通商口岸的（主要是上海）进口商。那时中国的进出口贸易十之九仍操诸洋商手中，所以实际上平准基金委员会的便宜外汇大半是资助了洋商，特别是美英帝国主义国家的商人。在这期间，平准基金委员会的美英籍委员实际上起了很大的作用。平准基金中美国的借款成份最大，所以美籍委员的发言权也最大。如果不是太平洋战事切断他的活动机会的话，平准基金委员会以及他的姊妹机构外汇管理委员会是会在中国外汇及贸易政策上起很大的控制作用的。
    最后谈谈第三项的一九四二年的五亿美元信用借款。如上边所说过的，珍珠港事变以后，中国的海港都被日本封锁，国际贸易几等于零，物资既不能大量运进来，外汇也就起不了什么作用了。那么为什么还有一九四二年二月七日的五亿美元信用大借款呢？回想一下那时的国际国内形势！皖南事变后国民党政府实际上已经停止对日用兵而是积极的打击真正抗日的八路军及新四军。但是蒋介石反动政权认为抗日的招牌还是对他有用的，所以不肯放弃他。珍珠港事变后，蒋知道美国是骑虎难下，所以借抗日的招牌多多地骗取“美援”，用以加强他反共的斗争。国民党政府那时的财政实已日暮途穷，法币已是膨胀到要崩溃的程度了，所以很急迫的向美国求取美元，以谋挽救其日趋困难的财政。
    美国那时的国际政策亦是在矛盾中发展。一方面日本打他，他不得不抗日，同时他又迟迟不肯在欧洲开辟第二战场，坐视苏联独力抵抗法西斯德国的进攻。在远东，美国一方面不肯支助真正抗日的八路军及新四军，但同时则需要在中国抗日战争最危急的时候，对支持中国抗战有所表示。但是因为封锁关系，虽有借款，也无法运大量物资进来。所以这笔借款是无法合理地使用的。结果是填了国民党官僚们贪污发财的无底洞。其中二亿美元做了美金公债及美金储蓄券的抵押。二亿二千万美元则在美国买成黄金运回中国出售。美其名曰使法币回笼；实际上造成了四大家族及其走狗们发横财的大好机会！他们按很便宜的官价汇率，购买了美金公债；甚至大部分的美金公债在没有发行以前便由内部“分配”了。出国时成箱的带出，谋在国外兑现后存在外国银行！至于低价套买黄金，一再酿成臭气熏天的黄金贪污案，那更是全国人民所周知的了。此外，五亿美元借款中还有五千五百万为在美印钞票用去了，可谓是通货膨胀的费用；其中也有不少印钞票的回扣，为四大家族所吞了！五亿美元中，只有剩下的可怜的二千五百万元是用做购买纺织品的，而这批棉布，四大家族也赚了不少的钱！
    由此可知，美国五亿元的大借款实际上等于花了一大笔钱交给了四大家族。这笔借款的协定中没有具体规定还本付息的办法，只是说战后视当时情况双方协议归还的方法！这种说法表面上好像是很宽大，实际上条件是很苛刻！因为既未具体规定还本付息办法；便在后来成了无限度的条件。好像一口刀悬在债务者的头上，使债务者时时受着威胁！
    以上谈的是抗日时期的借款即奥斯汀所说的六亿七千万美元。其中每笔，都明显地含有侵略的内容。但因为中美在抗日战争中是盟国关系，其侵略中国的意图还没有十分明朗化。在抗战后期，尤其因为封锁的关系，美国对中国经济侵略的政策亦没有很大发展的机会。抗日战争胜利后，情况就大不相同了！一方面中国民主革命力量大为增强，中国人民解放运动突飞猛进。一方面四大家族的统治的崩溃的速度大为增加。同时没有日寇封锁了，海禁大开了，海运大通了，美国商人可以长趋直入占领中国市场！这种客观的情况使美帝国主义者政治上军事上更加积极地支持蒋介石反动政权反对中国人民，经济上更进一步明目张胆地攫取中国的经济命脉，大踏步的进行侵略。同时因为中国人民逐渐的看穿了美帝的阴谋，反美情绪日增，所以美帝又于战后做了些企图起欺骗作用的所谓“救济”工作。所有抗日胜利后的借款和赠款，包括奥斯汀所说的“另外十亿美元”，都是企图达到这些目的的。
