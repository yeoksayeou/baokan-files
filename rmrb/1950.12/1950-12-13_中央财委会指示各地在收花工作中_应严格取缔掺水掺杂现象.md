Xinhua News Agency, December 11th – The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in order to improve the quality of raw cotton and eliminate illegal acts such as adulteration and watering, has recently instructed the industrial and commercial administration and state-owned trade departments of local governments to pay close attention to the following points in cotton purchasing:

    (1) Whether state-owned trade or public and private manufacturers, all should strictly implement the cotton impurity and moisture content standards set by the National Cotton Inspection Conference in August of this year during cotton purchasing (moisture content is 11% for areas along the Yangtze River due to climate, and 10% for all other regions; impurity content is uniformly 1%). Those exceeding the standard for impurity and moisture content will have their prices reduced proportionally, and those below the standard will have their prices increased proportionally.

    (2) Local people's governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas should cooperate with cotton purchasing and use various methods to conduct propaganda among the vast number of cotton farmers and cotton merchants, using the power of the masses to jointly eliminate the man-made act of adulterating and watering raw cotton.

    (3) For individual unscrupulous merchants who only seek personal gain and disregard production, adulterating and watering cotton, appropriate punishment may be given after repeated persuasion proves ineffective. Public and private manufacturers who fail to purchase cotton according to standards and intentionally raise or lower the quality of raw cotton should also be educated.

Note: In the past, many cotton merchants had the bad habit of adulterating and watering cotton when dealing with domestic cotton. This not only had a significant impact on the production of the textile industry, but also wasted a lot of manpower and resources in processing, packaging, and transportation. Since liberation, due to the attention and implementation of impurity and moisture content standards in cotton purchasing throughout the country, and the implementation of proportional price increases or decreases according to standards, the quality of raw cotton in various places has been greatly improved. At present, man-made watering and adulteration have been basically eliminated in the Northeast and North China regions; however, in some areas, such as the newly liberated areas along the Yangtze River, the phenomenon of adulterating and watering cotton is still quite serious.

    中央财委会指示各地在收花工作中
    应严格取缔掺水掺杂现象
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会为了提高原棉质量，取缔掺杂掺水等不法行为，近特指示各地政府的工商行政和国营贸易部门在收花中应严密注意下列各点：
    （一）无论国营贸易及公私厂商，在收花中均应按照本年八月全国棉花检验会议所订棉花含杂含水标准（含水除长江沿岸因气候关系为百分之十一外，其他各地均为百分之十，含杂一律为百分之一）严格执行，含杂含水超过标准者，照分量减价，少于标准者，照分量加价。
    （二）棉产区各级地方人民政府应配合收花，采用各种方式向广大棉农及棉商进行宣传。以群众的力量共同杜绝人为的在原棉中掺杂掺水的行为。
    （三）对于个别只图私利，不顾生产，在棉花中掺杂掺水的不法商人，在屡劝无效后，可予以适当处分；对于公私厂商不按标准进行收花，有意提高或降低原棉质量者，亦应予以教育。
    按：过去各地有不少棉商在经营国产棉花时，有在棉花中掺杂掺水的恶习。这不仅使纺织工业的生产遭受重大影响，且在加工、打包、运输等方面浪费不少人力物力。解放以后，全国各地在收购棉花中由于注意与执行了含杂含水的标准，并按标准实行照分量加价或减价的办法，使各地原棉品质大为提高。目前在东北、华北地区已基本上消灭了人为的掺水掺杂行为；但也有部分地区，如长江沿岸的新解放区，棉花中掺杂掺水的现象仍相当严重。
