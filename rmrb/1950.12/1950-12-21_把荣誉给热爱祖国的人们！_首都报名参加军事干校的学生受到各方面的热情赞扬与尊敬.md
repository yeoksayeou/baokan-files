    [This Newspaper News] Students in Beijing who have signed up to join military cadre schools have been met with praise and respect from all sides.
    (Large and medium-sized schools in Beijing are preparing to bid farewell to students joining military cadre schools. Schools are widely creating and preparing farewell literary and artistic programs, planning to hold small or even school-wide farewell gatherings. The Horticulture Department of the Agricultural University plans to hold a relaxed and joyful farewell gathering, focusing on heart-to-heart talks, supplemented by entertainment, to encourage each other to do well in work and study in different positions. Professor Chen Xixin, the head of the department, will use horticultural techniques to promote blossoming flowers, decorate the venue with fresh flowers, and send the flowers to students who are embarking on glorious posts. Faculty, staff, and workers of Municipal No. 3 Middle School are preparing to give commemorative gifts to students joining military schools. Students of the entire class of Sanquan at Hebei Provincial Normal School are all helping students who have signed up by taking apart and washing quilts, mending clothes and socks, and knitting woolen trousers.
    Northern Jiaotong University's Beijing Railway Institute has enthusiastically launched a campaign to comfort the enrolled students. Many letters expressing condolences and respect to the enrolled students are delivered to the school's radio station for broadcast every day. When students visited President Liu of the institute, he stated that he not only expressed his highest respect to the 125 enrolled students in the school, but also represented all faculty, staff, and students in paying tribute to the enrolled students. He said, "The enrolled students have decided to dedicate their young lives to the greatest and most glorious cause. This is something we admire and respect very much!" He said that he was very happy and honored that his own two sons had also signed up to join military cadre schools. Students from the Chemical Engineering and Chemistry departments of Yenching University went to visit the enrolled students with gongs and drums and posted red couplets at their doors. The Trade Union of Pingmin Middle School held a warm tea party on the afternoon of the 16th to congratulate the students who gloriously signed up for military school.
    Parents of the students feel very honored that their children have signed up to participate in national defense construction, and have encouraged them to study hard and work diligently. Wang Longhua, a second-year student in the Horticulture Department of the Agricultural University, received letters of encouragement from his father and brother after signing up. In his father's letter, he said: "You came back and told me that you had signed up to join a military cadre school, and I feel infinitely honored in my heart. American imperialism is conspiring to expand its aggression, making it impossible for our country to build peacefully. Modern youth should all stand up and respond to the call of the motherland with practical actions and fight for the cause of national liberation. Your participation fully demonstrates a strong will to love the motherland and love the people. It is entirely correct to gloriously dedicate yourself to this great cause, and I very much agree with it. You don't need to worry about anything, and bravely advance under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao!"
    In order to provide physical examinations for students signing up for military cadre schools, the Third Hospital of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau held a meeting of all staff on the evening of the 14th. After the director reported on this task, a doctor immediately stood up and said: It is very glorious for the students to leave their schools and families for the sake of the motherland. We also feel honored to serve them. Everyone scrambled to volunteer for work. The Nursing Department is rushing to complete its year-end summary and budget, and many nurses have been automatically working overtime for this. Posters with slogans such as "Heroic Spirit, Admired by All!" and "Defend National Defense, Overthrow American Imperialism!" are posted everywhere in the hospital to show their welcome and respect for the students participating in military cadre schools. The staff of other hospitals that are giving physical examinations to enrolled students are also particularly excited. Staff at the First Health Clinic also worked overtime on Sunday.
