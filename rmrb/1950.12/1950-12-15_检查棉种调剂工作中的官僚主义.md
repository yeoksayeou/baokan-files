    Examining Bureaucracy in Cotton Seed Allocation
    Central Ministry of Agriculture, Industrial Raw Materials Department

    The 1950 cotton planting task was originally set at 50.65 million mu. Due to the correct grasp and implementation of the policy of rewarding increased production of industrial raw materials by the central and all levels of leadership, as well as the efforts of staff at all levels, the enthusiastic response of the masses, and the overcoming of various difficulties, the original plan was exceeded. Recent statistics show that the actual planting area reached over 55 million mu. Before sowing, it was discovered that some disaster areas and some areas with larger cotton field expansion lacked seeds. Many areas needed to breed and replace improved varieties. Therefore, widespread attention was paid to seed allocation. The total amount of organized cotton seed allocation nationwide reached over 78 million jin. In addition to local control and purchase and nearby allocation, various regions and provinces also carried out allocation with neighboring regions and provinces, and imported a batch of improved varieties from abroad, solving the seed problem for 6.7 million mu of cotton fields. This is one of the main factors in completing and exceeding the cotton planting task this year. However, serious bureaucratic and commandist errors also occurred in the large amount of seed allocation work. In the Northwest region, over 2.6 million jin of cotton seeds were loaned out in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi. The inspection during last year's purchase was not thorough enough, and new, old, good, and bad seeds were mixed in. Storage was also not carefully managed, resulting in large piles that became damp and moldy. At the time of sowing, they did not conduct research with experienced farmers to provide farmers with technical guidance tailored to the specific circumstances, such as the degree of mold in the cotton seeds and the fact that it was rainy and cool this spring. As a result, the seedlings in most areas emerged very poorly. In the worst cases, only 10% of the seedlings emerged, requiring replanting or resowing. It is estimated that the state investment loss was over 3 billion yuan, and the losses to the masses were even greater. In the North China region, 370,000 jin of Si Zi cotton seeds were transported from Shaanxi to Shanxi. Due to the heavy rain last autumn, the maturity of the cotton seeds was very poor. When distributed in cotton-producing counties such as Xinjiang and Quwo for promotion, most of the cotton seeds rotted, and the germination rate was very low. In Xinjiang's third district, out of 8,489 mu planted in twelve villages, only 1,470 mu did not require replanting. The area destroyed due to missing seedlings and withering reached 83%. In Quwo, in the pure Si Zi cotton planting area of thirty-five villages, only 30% to 40% of the cotton seeds germinated and emerged, and all the seedlings were diseased, gradually rotting upwards from the roots. The 100,000 jin of cotton seeds purchased by Shanxi Province in Wenshui County were not only of poor quality, but also mixed with soil during transportation, rendering them unusable as seeds. In the Central South region, Hubei Province overemphasized the shortage of seeds and transferred 700,000 jin of cotton seeds from East China. There was no inspection during the purchase, and there were many mixed and bad seeds. The transportation work was also not well organized, resulting in rain, heat, and mold during the journey. The germination rate of the seeds was generally around 30%, and three jin of seeds could only be used as one jin of usable cotton seeds. The purchase price and transportation cost of each jin of cotton seeds amounted to six or seven jin of rice. An inspection of six cotton fields in Southeast Lake Village in Jiangling revealed that one household had a seedling emergence rate of 50%, three households had 30%, one household had 10%, and one household had less than 10%. In Lijiabu, one mu of cotton field was sown with six jin of seeds, but after half a month, only thirty seedlings emerged. The germinating buds were attacked by anthracnose before脱籽壳 and died. In the East China region, the quantity of seed allocation this year was the largest, and the distribution and transportation were generally well managed in terms of time, but the maturity of the cotton seeds purchased locally was too poor, and the germination rate was not good. In the worst cases, it was less than 10%. Some places did not pay attention to storage, and there was a lot of damage. Secondly, the estimated shortage of seeds was inaccurate, resulting in too many seeds being prepared and not being able to be loaned out. 2.74 million jin were left over in Southern Jiangsu, about 2 million jin in Northern Jiangsu, about 360,000 jin in Shandong, and 1.92 million jin in Zhejiang. The 2.74 million jin of cotton seeds left over in Southern Jiangsu alone wasted over 550 million yuan due to storage, transportation, and price depreciation losses.

    This year's cotton seed allocation suffered from poor quality and high prices, and the new seeds had not been demonstrated and had not gained the trust of the masses, resulting in resistance from cadres and opposition from the masses. In Hubei, batches of loaned seeds (transported from Zhejiang) were found to be sold to oil mills. Some cadres in Southern Jiangsu believed that lending seeds was "troublesome" and "usury," so serious commandism occurred in the promotion work. For example, in Shandong, there was a phenomenon of assigning improved varieties. In Southern Jiangsu, some were even embezzled and eaten by village cadres. Secondly, because the degree of cotton seed shortage was overestimated, measures were taken to prohibit cotton seed oil extraction before cotton sowing. Staff in some areas inspected oil mills, interfered with the operation of oil mills, and froze the raw materials of oil mills, causing some people to doubt and be dissatisfied with the industrial and commercial policies. In short, this year's cotton seed allocation work has achieved results, but there are also serious bureaucratic and commandist bad work styles, which not only resulted in the waste of state wealth and harm to the interests of the people, but also caused great damage to the political credibility of the people's government in promotion work.

    Why did these errors occur? First, there was no in-depth investigation and precise calculation, and the degree of cotton seed shortage was excessively exaggerated. What is the actual situation? According to our calculation in January, the national cotton seed production in 1949 was estimated to be 17.01 million dan, and the planned cotton planting area in 1950 was 50.65 million mu. Based on a sowing amount of 10 jin per mu, a total of 50.65 million dan of cotton seeds were required, less than 30% of the total cotton seed production in 1949.

    The estimated national cotton seed production in 1949 and cotton seed requirements in 1950 are as follows:

    Due to the general increase in cotton field area in various places in 1950, some areas had a shortage of cotton seeds. In particular, the areas affected by water and drought disasters destroyed many cotton fields last year. Those that were not destroyed also experienced delayed maturity due to excessive autumn rain, which increased the amount of frost flower production, thereby affecting the percentage of cotton seeds that could be used for seeds. This situation was more serious in Jiangsu (especially Northern Jiangsu) and Anhui. In addition, the new liberated areas had a poor working foundation and many difficulties, which also increased the severity of the problem.

    However, the staff in various places overestimated the difficult side and ignored the fact that there was basically no shortage of cotton seeds within the scope of provinces and regions. They blindly carried out the purchase of cotton seeds and did not strictly adhere to the principle of "rather be short than substandard," only paying attention to quantity and lowering the quality requirements. For example, although the amount of cotton seeds transported from Shaanxi to Shanxi was reduced from the originally planned purchase of 2 million jin to 400,000 jin after the discovery of poor germination, many staff members were not satisfied with the cessation of the purchase. Hubei Province only needed 31% of the cotton seed production of 1949 for sowing in 1950, but still emphasized that the province was insufficient and insisted on the request to transfer tens of thousands of dan of cotton seeds from other regions.

    Second, some staff members suffered from an acute illness regarding the promotion of improved cotton varieties. They wanted to completely eliminate native cotton and replace it with improved varieties all at once, thinking that the current shortage of seeds among farmers was a good opportunity to replace all native varieties. Therefore, they consciously exaggerated the degree of seed shortage and the excellence of improved varieties, and the leaders did not conduct careful research and lightly believed it. As a result, the subjective wishes were used, and a large-scale long-distance transportation plan was widely adopted from the central government to the local level. Such an acute seed transfer and promotion plan may accidentally avoid making mistakes and succeed by chance, but fundamentally, if the estimation is inaccurate, if a difficulty occurs in one link, it will develop into a complete error. Domestic cotton seed transfers, such as the transfer from East China to Central South, from Shaanxi to Shanxi, and internal transfers within Shaanxi, resulted in huge losses due to poor purchase or careless transportation, resulting in low cotton seed germination rates. The personnel involved shirked responsibility to each other or blamed objective conditions. Although everyone admitted their mistakes after the review, the losses could not be remedied. Although the cotton seeds transferred from abroad were very good, the cost was very high. The promotion of Si Zi 5A in Changle, Shandong, was forced to be apportioned because it had not been tested and the masses were unwilling to accept it, committing a serious commandist error. 95,000 jin of improved varieties were dispersed to 163 villages without cotton planting habits, losing the significance of improved variety promotion. The promotion of Dai Zi cotton in Pinghu and Haiyan, Zhejiang, did not prepare well for promotion in advance. The foreign cotton seeds arrived a little late, and the masses had already planted cotton, so a large amount of expensive cotton seeds were put aside and could not be promoted.

    Third, there was a lack of specific organization, leadership, and inspection in the transportation work. First of all, our Central Ministry of Agriculture only focused on helping various places purchase seeds, such as raising funds and communicating relationships, but did not conduct in-depth inspections on the quality of seeds and transportation organization, so we failed to discover errors in time, point out and correct errors. Some districts and provinces not only lacked timely and in-depth inspections, but also lacked specific organization and leadership for this work. They assigned such a complex and arduous task to very few cadres, or to some untested personnel who lacked experience and ability, and gave them very little specific help and instructions. Even during transportation, no one escorted them at all, resulting in the reported germination rates being based on concepts or deliberately falsely reported, as well as adverse phenomena such as rain and mold, and mixing with soil and sand.

    Fourth, in addition to the above main reasons, there were many objective difficulties. Last year's excessive autumn rain delayed the cotton boll opening, and the maturity of cotton seeds was generally insufficient in various places. Some places had to bake the seed cotton after it was wet before ginning, which further reduced the germination ability of the cotton seeds. There were too few warehouses, and they were generally stored in the open air. The transportation lacked good packaging with hemp bags, making it difficult to avoid rain and moisture. In addition, there was a lot of rain and cold this spring, and the ground temperature was not suitable for cotton seed germination in some places. The spread of diseases such as Rhizoctonia solani and anthracnose also caused poor cotton seed germination or seedling damage and death. Some of these objective difficulties can be overcome by strengthening organizational work, and some cannot be overcome under the current conditions.

    What principles should be adopted for cotton seed transportation in the future? Our opinion is that cotton seed allocation is still necessary for the small amount of seed shortage in some disaster areas and newly expanded cotton planting areas, as well as for the popularization of improved varieties. In addition to strengthening cadre education and establishing a pragmatic work style, the following principles must be strictly adhered to in specific organizational work: (1) The allocation of general cotton seeds must be based on the selection of seeds before purchasing cotton seeds to ensure the quality and germination rate of the cotton seeds. Allocation and transportation should be carried out in small quantities and within a small range in principle, so as to avoid defects such as poor growth and deterioration of quality due to the unsuitability of climate and soil. Short-distance transportation is easier to organize, can reduce rain, rot, and mold, and is also more economical in terms of cost. As for areas with severe disasters and excessive shortage of cotton seeds, farmers mainly require planting edible crops after the disaster, and farmers should be actively allowed to appropriately reduce the cotton field area and reduce the heavy burden of cotton seed allocation. (2) The promotion of improved varieties must be steadily organized on the basis of breeding improved varieties, from point to surface, from small to large. It must go through breeding farms, improved variety management areas, and then replace the farmers' large cotton fields in phases and regions. A large amount of long-distance allocation of improved varieties should not be adopted. (3) The distribution of general cotton seeds must ensure a high germination rate, and the promotion of improved varieties must be subject to quality identification. Improved variety seed cotton must be processed by professional ginning mills, and strict separation, ginning, screening, and grain selection must be done, and the available warehouses must be stored. The transportation packaging must be good. This year, the quality and germination rate of improved varieties mastered by professional ginning mills in Hebei Province are generally very good, and their experience is worth learning. In the allocation work, special agencies and personnel must be designated to be responsible from purchase to promotion, and a handover system must be established. It must be carried out in an organized and led manner, not just casually purchased and vaguely distributed.

    检查棉种调剂工作中的官僚主义
    中央农业部  工业原料司
    一九五○年的植棉任务原布置五○六五万亩，由于中央以及各级领导机关正确的掌握与贯彻奖励工业原料作物的增产政策，以及各级工作人员的努力，群众的热烈响应号召，克服了种种困难，超过原订计划，最近统计实际播种面积达五五○○万亩以上。播种前即发现了某些灾区及某些棉田扩展较大地区种籽不足，许多地区需繁殖与换种良种，因之普遍注意了种籽的调剂，总计全国有组织的调剂棉种数量达七八○○余万斤，各区省除当地掌握选购与近地调剂外，并进行了邻区、邻省的调剂，和自国外引入一批良种，共解决了六七百万亩棉田的种籽，是今年完成并超过植棉任务的主要因素之一。但是在大量的调剂种籽工作中也发生了严重的官僚主义与命令主义的错误：西北区，在陕西关中地区贷放棉种二百六十余万斤，去年收购中检验不够认真，将新、陈、好、坏掺杂的种籽收了进来，储存又不注意，大堆积放以致受潮发霉，播种时又不去和有经验的农民群众研究针对棉籽霉坏程度和今春雨多地凉等实况给农民以切合具体情况的技术指导，结果大部分地区的苗出的很不好。最坏的仅有一成苗，必须补种或翻种，据估计国家投资损失三十多亿，群众的损失更大。华北区，由陕运晋斯字棉种三十七万斤，因去秋雨多，棉籽成熟度很坏，分发在新绛、曲沃等产棉县进行推广时，棉籽大部腐烂，发芽率很低。新绛三区十二个村共种八四八九亩，其中未经补播者仅一四七○亩，由于缺苗枯死毁种者达百分之八十三。曲沃三十五个村斯字棉纯种区，棉籽发芽出土的仅百分之三十到四十，且全部幼苗罹病，由根部逐渐向上腐烂。晋省在文水县采购的十万斤棉种，不但质量低劣，还发生了运输掺土不能再作种用。中南区、湖北省过分的强调缺种，自华东调运的七十万斤棉种，收购时没有检查，杂籽、坏籽等很多，又没有组织好运输工作，以致在途中雨淋发热发霉，种籽发芽率一般在百分之三十左右，三斤方可抵到一斤可用的棉籽，每斤棉籽的买价和运费，合到六七斤大米。在江陵东南湖村检查六家棉田，出苗百分之五十的一户，百分之三十的三户，百分之十的一户，百分之十以下的一户，李家埠有一亩棉田播种六斤，半月后只出苗三十棵，种芽未脱籽壳即受炭疽病侵害而死。华东区，今年调剂种籽数量最多，分发调运在时间上一般还掌握的好，但在当地收购的棉种成熟度太差，发芽率不好，最坏的尚不及百分之十，部分地方保管贮存不注意，有不少损坏情形。其次事前估计缺种数量不当，结果准备的棉种太多，贷不下去，苏南剩下了二七四万斤，苏北约二○○万斤，山东约三六万斤，浙江有一九二万斤。仅苏南剩余的二七四万斤棉籽，由于保管、调运及贬价的损失就浪费了五亿五千余万元。
    今年的棉种调剂由于质量不好，价格又大，和新种未经示范，没有取得群众的信任，以致干部抵抗群众反对。湖北发现成批的贷种（由浙江运去的）卖到油坊，苏南有些干部认为贷种是“找麻烦”、“高利贷”，因而推广工作中也发生了严重的强迫命令，如山东有派种良种现象，苏南更有被村干部贪污吃掉了的。其次因为过分估计了棉籽缺乏的程度，在棉花播种前曾采取了禁止棉籽榨油的措施，某些地区的工作人员检查油坊，干涉油坊的营业，冻结油坊的原料，以致引起一些人对工业商业政策的怀疑和不满。总之今年的棉种调剂工作有成绩，同时也存在着严重的官僚主义与命令主义的恶劣作风，不但形成了对国家财富的浪费，对人民利益的危害，也造成了人民政府在推广工作上政治信誉的极大损失。
    为什么会形成这些错误呢？首先，是没有深入调查和精密的计算，过分的夸大了棉种缺乏的程度。实际情况是什么呢？据我们在一月份的计算，一九四九年全国棉籽产额估计可产一七○一万市担，一九五○年计划植棉五○六五万亩，每亩播种量按十斤计算，共需棉种五○六·五万担，不及一九四九年棉籽产量总额的十分之三。
    兹将全国一九四九年棉籽产量及一九五○年棉种需要量，估计如下表：

     江西       二二     六·六        二七       二·七      四○·九    由于一九五○年各地棉田面积普遍的增加，某些地区有棉种不够的现象，尤其是水旱灾区去年毁废了很多棉田，未毁废的也因为秋雨过多成熟迟延增加了霜花产量，因而影响到可做种用的棉籽的成数降低，这种情况以江苏（尤以苏北）安徽比较严重。加之新解放区工作基础较差，困难较多，也增加了问题的严重性。
    但是各地工作人员过分看重了困难的一面。而忽略以省、区为范围，基本上棉籽不缺少的情况，盲目的进行收购棉种，没有严格掌握住宁缺勿滥的方针，只注意数量，降低了质的要求。例如由陕运晋的棉籽，虽因发现了发芽不良由预定购买二百万斤减到了四十万斤，但许多工作人员对停止收购并不满意。湖北省五○年播种量只需四九年棉籽产量的百分之三十一，还强调全省不足，坚持从外区调入数万担棉种的要求。
    第二、部分工作人员对于推广棉花良种，犯了急性病，想一下子把土棉淘汰净尽，换成良种，以为这次农民缺种，正是换尽土种的好机会。因此，就有意识地夸大了种籽缺乏与良种优良的程度，而领导上也未加审慎的研究，予以轻信。遂以主观的愿望，从中央到地方广泛的采用了远程大量调运的方针。这种犯急性病的调种推广计划偶然的可能不犯错误侥幸成功，但基本上如估计不确实，遇有一个环节发生困难，即会演成全盘错误，国内调运棉种，如华东运中南、陕西运山西，和陕西内部的调运或因收购马虎，或因运输不慎，致使棉籽发芽率低招致巨大损失。经手人员，又互相推诿责任，或归罪于客观条件，检讨结果虽经大家认错，还补救不了损失。国外调运棉种，棉籽虽然很好，花费却是很大。在山东昌乐推广的斯字五Ａ，因未经过试验群众不愿接受，因而强迫摊派犯了严重的命令主义错误，把九五○○○斤良种分散到一六三个没有植棉习惯的村庄种植，失掉了良种推广意义。在浙江平湖海盐推广的岱字棉，事前没有做好推广准备，国外棉种运来稍迟，群众已种了棉花，因而把成本很贵的大量棉种搁置起来推不出去。
    第三、是在调运工作中缺乏具体的组织领导和检查。首先我们中央农业部仅着重了帮助各地购买种籽中的筹措经费沟通关系等工作，但是对种籽好坏及运输组织等没有作深入检查，以致未能及时发现错误，指出和纠正错误。某些区、省不仅缺乏及时深入的检查，且对这一工作没有具体的组织领导，把这样复杂而繁重的任务，派很少的几个干部去担负，或者是交给一些未经过考验的缺乏经验和能力的人员去做，对他们又很少具体的帮助和指示，甚至在运输中根本无人押运，以致所报的发芽率有的是从概念出发或者是故意虚报，以及着雨发霉，掺土掺沙等恶劣现象发生。
    第四、除上述主要原因外，客观上也存在着许多困难。去年秋雨过多，影响棉花开絮迟延，各地一般棉籽成熟度不够，有些地方因籽棉潮湿多经过烘烤后再轧花，更减低了棉籽的发芽能力。仓库太少一般都是露天贮存，运输中缺乏麻袋包装不良，很难避免着雨受潮。加之今春雨多地寒，有些地方地温不够棉籽发芽的适宜温度。立枯炭疽等病的蔓延，也使棉种发芽不良或幼苗受病害侵袭而死。这些客观困难有些是加强组织工作便可以克服的，有些是在目前条件下尚不可能克服的。
    今后棉种调运应该采取什么方针呢？我们意见认为对部分灾区和新扩展植棉区域的少量缺种情况下，及良种普及工作上，棉种调剂仍然是必需的，除加强干部教育树立实事求是的工作作风外，在具体组织工作上须严格掌握下列的原则：（一）一般棉种的调剂，须在选种工作的基础上收购棉种，才能保证了棉种的品质和发芽率。调剂调运应该以较小数量的小范围内进行为原则，以免由于气候风土的不适而发生生长不良品质变劣等缺陷。且短途运输既容易组织，又可减少着雨腐烂发霉，在用费上亦经济很多。至于在灾情严重棉种过于缺乏的地区，农民在灾荒后主要是要求种植食用作物，应该主动的让农民酌量缩减棉田面积并可减少棉种调剂的重负。（二）良种的推广必须是在繁殖良种基础上稳步的组织推广，由点到面，由小到大，要经过繁种场，良种管理区，然后再分期分区的更换农民的大地棉田，不应采取大量的自国外引入和国内远程调剂良种大批推广的方针。（三）发放一般棉种必须要保证高度的发芽率，推广良种必须经过品质鉴定。良种籽棉一定要经由专业轧花厂加工，严格的做好分收、分轧、筛选、粒选等工作与可用的仓库贮藏，运输的包装必须良好，今年河北省各专业轧花厂所掌握的良种品质和发芽率一般都很好，他们的经验是值得吸取的。在调剂工作中，必须从收购到推广指定专门机构与专人负责，建立交接制度，有组织有领导的进行，不是随随便便收购进来和模模糊糊的发放出去。
