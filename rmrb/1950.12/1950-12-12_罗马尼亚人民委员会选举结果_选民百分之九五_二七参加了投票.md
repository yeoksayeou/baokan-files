    [This report is transmitted by the Romanian Embassy in China] The election of the People's Council of the Romanian People's Republic has been successfully completed. The results are as follows: Out of 9,944,067 registered voters, 9,473,882 people voted, accounting for 95.27% of the total number of voters. Among them, 9,124,766 people (96.31%) voted for the People's Democratic Front, 128,340 people (1.36%) voted against it, and 220,776 votes (2.33%) were invalidated.
    A total of 109,311 representatives were elected to the People's Councils of various states, cities, districts and villages, of which women accounted for 25.5% and non-Party members accounted for 51.6%.
    In Bucharest, out of a total of 780,728 registered voters, 766,483 people actually voted (accounting for 98.17%), of which 750,989 people (accounting for 97.97%) voted for the People's Democratic Front, 4,650 people (accounting for 0.61%) voted against, and 10,844 votes were invalid (accounting for 1.42%). In Bucharest's 72nd electoral district, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, was nominated as a candidate. 98% of registered voters participated in the vote, of which 99.5% voted for him, with one vote against and three invalid votes.
    The number of people participating in this election is unprecedented. During the rule of the bourgeoisie and landlords, only 3,661,352 people registered to vote in the 1928 election, and only 77% of them actually voted. In 1937, the number of people who actually voted accounted for only 67% of the registered voters. Even compared with the 1948 election, only 7,661,031 people participated in the election at that time. The results of the People's Council election on December 3, 1950, greatly exceeded the past.

    罗马尼亚人民委员会选举结果
    选民百分之九五·二七参加了投票
    【本报讯】据罗马尼亚驻华大使馆讯：罗马尼亚人民共和国人民委员会选举已胜利完成，其结果如下：在九、九四四、○六七已登记选民中，有九、四七三、八八二人投了票，占选民总数的百分之九五·二七，其中九、一二四、七六六人（占百分之九六·三一）投人民民主阵线的票，一二八、三四○人（占百分之一·三六）投反对票，二二○、七七六（占百分之二三三）张票作废。
    在各州、市、区和乡村的人民委员会中，一共选出了一○九、三一一名代表，其中妇女占百分之二五·五，无党派人士占百分之五一·六。
    在布加勒斯特全体七八○、七二八个已登记的选民中，实际投票人数有七六六、四八三人（占百分之九八·一七），其中七五○、九八九人（占百分之九七·九七）投人民民主阵线的票，四、六五○人（占百分之○·六一）投反对票，废票一○、八四四张（占百分之一·四二），在布加勒斯特第七十二号选区中，罗马尼亚工人党总书记乔治乌·德治被提名为候选人，参加投票的占已登记选民的百分之九十八，其中百分之九九·五投了他的票，反对票一张，废票三张。
    参加这次选举的人数是空前的。在资产阶级与地主的统治时代，一九二八年的选举，仅有三、六六一、三五二人登记投票，而实际投票的只占其中的百分之七十七；在一九三七年，实际投票的人数只占已登记选民的百分之六十七。甚至与一九四八年的选举相比，那时也只有七、六六一、○三一人参加选举。而一九五○年十二月三日人民委员会的选举成绩却大大超过了往昔。
