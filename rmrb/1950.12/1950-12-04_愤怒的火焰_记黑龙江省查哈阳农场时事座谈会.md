    Flames of Anger
    A Record of the Current Affairs Forum at Chahayang Farm, Heilongjiang Province
    Chen Xi
    After supper, people wiped the grease from their hands, extinguished the fires in their stoves, and put down their pens, walking one after another into the office of the sub-trade union to attend the current affairs forum. The newspapers had just arrived, and the headline news was "American Imperialists Expand Atrocities, Invade Shandong Coast." Angry voices could be heard from the crowd from time to time. The atmosphere was tense and agitated.
    The chairman announced the meeting was open. Before the brief opening remarks were finished, tractor driver Zhang Jichuan eagerly rushed to express his opinion. Then came female tractor driver Lin Zhixiu, then... People's speeches were like a surging torrent, continuing without interruption. Flames of anger burst forth from every pair of eyes; some flushed red, some clenched their teeth.
    People thoughtfully recalled their lives of five, four, and three years ago. And they could not help but make a comparison with today. Listen: Wang Kuhuai, the head of the sand-turning team, talked about working in Anshan under Japanese rule five years ago, receiving rations every five days; the acorn flour was both bloating and caused diarrhea. Wang Shilin, the driver who set a new record for harrowing, recounted how he ran away for five or six years to avoid being conscripted as a laborer, and how his mother cried herself blind. Two drivers from peasant backgrounds—Gao Tingyi and Wang Shaoqi—recalled how they were driven to desperation by the landlords in the past. People who have suffered through painful days understand what freedom and slavery are. They asked: Would we allow such days to come upon us again? The answer was definite: No! Absolutely not!
    People have already begun a happy life. But these days were earned by their own labor under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. It wasn't easy! Yu Changqing, the head of the old lathe team, came when the farm was first established. At that time, the machinery repair shop was a dilapidated frame, with few workers and a lot of work. He said: "Sometimes, when working the night shift, there was no shelter, and the mosquitoes buzzed around, biting my hands until they were covered in blisters." And now? "Hey! Brick houses, iron frames, glass windows, three meals of rice a day, what more could you ask for!?" Everyone present thought of the hardships of the farm's early days and the relatively ideal situation today. Many people raised the issue of benefits beyond wages, such as the implementation of labor protection regulations. Zhang Desheng contracted appendicitis, and if he hadn't been promptly sent to the hospital in Qiqihar by car, he would have died. And the farm? Gao Tingyi put it well: "Our farm is growing exponentially." The fact is: in 1948, there were only twenty-four tractors; now there are sixty-seven of various sizes; in 1948, there were a few thatched houses; now there are tractor depots, processing and agricultural implement depots, tractor team staff dormitories, and employee family dormitories, all made of brick; in 1948, the farm planted two thousand hectares of land; this year it's more than six thousand hectares; in 1948, more than 1.3 million jin of rice were harvested; last year, more than 13 million jin were harvested; this year, it is estimated that 20 million jin can be harvested. And all this is just the beginning. People see the past, present, and future clearly from concrete examples.
    Now, in Wang Kuhuai's words, it is "we are holding a bowl of fragrant rice, about to eat, but the American imperialist mad dog wants to overturn it." What to do? Those present issued the unanimous roar of the people of the whole country: Absolutely cannot tolerate it, resolutely strike the aggressors! Yes, the victorious people will defend their great motherland and the fruits of victory with unparalleled heroism. Tractor driver Wang Shicheng, who had just returned from Beijing after attending the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, called on everyone to say: "In the struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, we must carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese people's heroism and justice. Young people: Stand up, be prepared to join the army and fight at any time! When the motherland needs us, we will jump from the tractor to the tank to defend the motherland and defend lasting peace." His speech was unanimously echoed by the masses, becoming their loyal oath to the motherland.
    The speech of Jiang Yingxing, a female worker from the machinery repair shop, brought everyone's emotions to an excited peak. She said: "I am a Korean woman. The American imperialists' invasion of our country has ignited a fire in my heart. We no longer want to be slaves of the American imperialists..." She thought of the brutality of the American imperialists in Korea and the plight of Korean mothers and children, and, overcome with emotion, she burst into tears and could not continue. But in the end, she transformed her grief and indignation into strength, resolutely vowing: "For the liberation of the motherland, I will intensify my training in practical work and do everything I can to support the Korean War." Her speech made people even more excited, and they expressed their determination to support the Korean War with internationalist spirit.
    The flames of anger burned. Everywhere, one could hear curses against the American imperialists and confidence in one's own strength. People know that, now, the first things to do on the production front are: to carry out production better, to strictly guard against enemy sabotage... All this will become a direct striking force against the American imperialists.

    愤怒的火焰
    记黑龙江省查哈阳农场时事座谈会
    陈犀
    晚饭后，人们擦净了手上的油，熄灭了炉里的火，放下笔，络绎地走进分总工会的办公室，来参加时事座谈会。报纸才送到，头条消息就是“美帝扩大暴行侵袭山东沿海”。在人群中不时听到愤愤的声音。空气紧张而激动。
    主席宣布开会了，简短的开会词还没有说完，拖拉机手张季川就抢着发表了意见。接着是女拖拉机手林志修，接着……人们的发言像汹涌的洪流，不断头地讲下去。愤怒的火焰从每双眼睛里迸发出来；有的涨红了脸，有的咬紧了牙。
    人们都意味深长地回忆着五年、四年、三年以前的生活。并且不由自禁地要和今日作一个对比。听吧：翻沙组长王库槐讲他五年前在日本统治的鞍山作工，五天领一回配给粮，橡子面吃了又胀又泻。创造耙地新纪录的驾驶员王士林叙述自己为了躲避抓劳工，跑在外面五六年，母亲是怎样哭瞎了眼。农民出身的两个驾驶员——高廷义和王少起，追述了过去怎样被地主逼得无路可走。从痛苦的日子里熬煎出来的人们，是懂得什么是自由和奴隶的。他们问：难道我们会允许那样的日子再临到我们的头上吗？答案是肯定的：不能！坚决不许可！
    人们已经开始了幸福的生活。但这日子是在中国共产党领导下，用自己的劳动换来的。不容易呀！老旋盘组长于长清，是建场时来的。那时候，机械修理厂是个破房框子，工友少，活计多。他说：“有时候打夜班，没遮挡，蚊子嗡嗡的，手咬的净是大疱。”现在呢？“嘿！砖房，铁架玻璃窗子，一天三顿大米饭，还有比！？”在座的人都想起了建场当时的艰苦和今天的比较理想的情况。很多人提出了工资以外的待遇，如劳保条例的执行。张德胜得了盲肠炎，若不是及时用汽车送到齐齐哈尔的医院，就只有待死了。农场呢？高廷义说的好：“我们农场是成倍地往大长。”事实是：一九四八年只有二十四台拖拉机，现在有大小六十七台了；一九四八年有草房几间，现在有拖拉机库、加工业农具库、拖拉机队人员宿舍，和职工家属宿舍，这些都是砖的；一九四八年农场种了两千垧地，今年是六千多垧；一九四八年收了一百三十多万斤稻子，去年收了一千三百多万斤，今年估计可收两千万斤。而且这一切，只是一个开端。人们从具体事例中，看清了过去，现在，和未来。
    现在，用王库槐的话来说，就是“我们端着一碗喷香的饭，正要吃，美帝这只疯狗却要来弄翻”。怎么办？到会的人发出了举国人民一致的怒吼：绝对不能容忍，坚决给侵略者以打击！是的，胜利了的人民定会以无比的英雄气概来保卫自己的伟大祖国和胜利果实。参加全国工农兵劳模代表大会，刚从北京归来的拖拉机手王士成号召大家说：“在抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争中，我们要发扬中国人民英勇正义的光荣传统。青年们：挺起身来，准备随时参军参战！祖国需要我们的时候，我们就从拖拉机跳到坦克上去，保卫祖国，保卫持久和平。”他的发言为群众一致响应，成了人们对祖国的忠诚宣誓。
    机械修理厂的女工姜英星的发言，将大家的情绪引到激动的顶点。她说：“我是一个朝鲜女人，美帝侵略我们的祖国，使我心里引起了火，我们再不愿作美帝的亡国奴。……”她想到了美帝在朝鲜的残暴兽行，和朝鲜的母亲和孩子们的遭遇，过度激动，流下了泪，竟不能继续下去。但最后她终于把悲愤化为力量，坚毅地宣誓：“为了祖国的解放，我要在实际工作中加紧锻炼自己，尽一切努力，支援朝鲜战争。”她的发言使人们更加激动，纷纷表示要以国际主义精神支援朝鲜战争。
    愤怒的火焰燃烧起来了。到处可以听见对美帝的诅咒和对自己力量的信心。人们知道，在现在，在生产战线上先应作好那些事：更好地进行生产，严防敌特破坏……这一切将成为对美帝的直接打击力量。
