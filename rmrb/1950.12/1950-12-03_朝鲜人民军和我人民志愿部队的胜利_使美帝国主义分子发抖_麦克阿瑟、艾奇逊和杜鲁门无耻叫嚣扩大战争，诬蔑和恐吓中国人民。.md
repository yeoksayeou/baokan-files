Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: As the U.S. invading forces' dream of a "general offensive" to occupy all of Korea before Christmas has been utterly defeated under the powerful counterattack of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, the U.S. imperialists, watching their aggressive plans collapse, have fallen into unprecedented panic, rage, and frenzy. MacArthur, Acheson, and Truman have successively issued a series of shameless slanderous and intimidating statements against the Chinese people, which they have long been accustomed to.

On November 28th, MacArthur, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. invading forces in the Far East, first, after the disgraceful failure of his adventurous offensive, issued the so-called "United Nations Command" Communiqué No. 14. Under the pretext of "armed forces from mainland China are now confronting United Nations forces in North Korea," he frantically shouted that "we are facing a completely new war" and that "this situation presents the problem of finding solutions within the various councils of the United Nations and the governments of the world," openly attempting to coerce the United Nations into covering up his expansion of the flames of aggression to China.

Subsequently, on November 29th, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson delivered a lengthy speech in Washington called "The Strategy of Freedom." Acheson first used the trick of "a thief crying 'stop thief!'" preposterously slandering the righteous action of the Chinese People's Volunteers aiding Korea and protecting their homes and defending their country as an "act of aggression." Acheson, after spouting all the fabricated "charges" he could muster, creating further "excuses" for the United States, its puppet states, and the so-called "United Nations" under its control to expand aggression, and frantically demanding that the United States and its puppet states further expand their arms and prepare for war, blatantly threatened to push the entire world into war. He openly clamored, "No one can guarantee that war will not come. We must be prepared for the worst possible outcome."

The shameless slander and intimidation of MacArthur and Acheson was even more shamelessly manifested in the statement of U.S. President Truman at a press conference on November 30th. After lamenting that "a large part of the battle line under MacArthur's command has been forced to retreat... We may again, as before, be defeated," Truman absurdly insisted that the victory of China and the Korean people's war of resistance against the U.S. to defend their homes and country would threaten the "security and survival" of the United States, which is 16,000 miles away, and therefore demanded "three methods to deal with the new situation": First, he slandered the solemn accusation of the United States' aggression against our territory of Taiwan by the Chinese special representative Wu Hsiu-chuan at the United Nations as "violent and completely absurd" and attempted to coerce the United Nations to take so-called "unified action" as a fig leaf for the United States to expand its aggressive actions to China; second, to strengthen the aggressive military forces around the world at a "very rapid rate," first of all, the so-called "European Allied Forces under the unified command of a supreme commander are needed more urgently than ever before"; third, to greatly increase the speed and scale of the U.S. arms expansion. Truman specifically stated, "I will submit a supplementary request for funds needed for the immediate expansion of our armed forces and to improve their effectiveness. I hope to meet with congressional leaders tomorrow to ask them to consider these appropriations immediately." And when Truman answered questions at the press conference, he brazenly stated that "the matter before the United Nations is to take action against the Chinese Communists." Truman even threatened, "From a military point of view, all weapons must be considered."

No matter how pretentious Truman, Acheson, and MacArthur are, the mouthpiece of the American bourgeoisie, the Associated Press, more directly exposed the great ambitions and meager talents of these arrogant aggressors. The Associated Press, on the 28th, in calculating the serious difficulties the U.S. would encounter once it launched a major war, admitted that "Asia, with its billions of people, will be a quagmire that absorbs Western combat manpower," and that Western Europe "has only a small number of disorganized and untrained troops, many of which are poorly equipped." If a war were to occur, "these troops would be ducks waiting to be slaughtered by the Soviet army." The Associated Press pointed out, "Mentioning only a portion of these difficulties is enough to make the most stubborn Western officials tremble." And Truman and Acheson's clamoring in their speeches to further strengthen the military strength of the United States and Western Europe is precisely a manifestation of this "trembling."

    朝鲜人民军和我人民志愿部队的胜利
    使美帝国主义分子发抖
    麦克阿瑟、艾奇逊和杜鲁门无耻叫嚣扩大战争，诬蔑和恐吓中国人
    民。
    【新华社一日讯】由于美国侵略军梦想在圣诞节以前占领全部朝鲜的“总攻势”已在中国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军的强大反击下一败涂地，眼看着自己的侵略计划归于泡影的美帝国主义分子已陷入了空前的惊慌暴怒与狂乱。麦克阿瑟、艾奇逊、杜鲁门相继发表一通对中国人民早已司空见惯的无耻的诬蔑和恐吓的声明。
    十一月二十八日，美国在远东的侵略军总司令麦克阿瑟首先在其冒险攻势可耻地破产以后，发表了所谓“联合国司令部”第十四号公报，在所谓“中国大陆上的武装部队，现已在北朝鲜与联合国部队对垒”这种借口下，狂呼“我们正面临着一个完全新的战争”，“这种局势提出了必须在联合国各理事会和世界各国政府以内寻找解决办法的问题”，公然企图胁迫联合国掩护他把侵略火焰延烧到中国。
    接着，在十一月二十九日，美国国务卿艾奇逊在华盛顿发表了一篇长篇广扩演说，叫做什么“自由的战略”。艾奇逊首先以“贼喊捉贼”的伎俩，将中国人民志愿援助朝鲜和保家卫国的正义行动荒谬地诬蔑为“侵略行为”。艾奇逊在信口雌黄地用尽了他所能搜罗得到的全部捏造“罪状”，为美国，为美国的仆从国，以及为美国所控制下的所谓“联合国”编造了进一步扩大侵略的“借口”，并疯狂地要求美国与其仆从国家进一步扩军备战以后，露骨地威胁着要把整个世界推向战争。他公开叫嚣：“谁也不能保证战争不会到来。我们要准备应付最坏的可能。”
    麦克阿瑟、艾奇逊的厚颜无耻的诬蔑与恐吓，在十一月三十日美国总统杜鲁门于记者招待会上的声明中得到了更无耻的表现。杜鲁门在哀鸣麦克阿瑟“指挥下的战线很大一部分被迫撤退……。我们可能又像以前一样，遭到失败”以后，竟荒唐地硬说中国与朝鲜人民保家卫国的抗美战争的胜利，会威胁到远在一万六千里以外的美国之“安全与生存”，因而要求“以三种方法对付新的局势”，就是：第一，把中国特派代表伍修权在联合国对美国侵略我国领土台湾的严正的控诉，诬称为“猛烈而完全荒谬”，并企图胁迫联合国采取所谓“一致行动”来作为美国把侵略行动扩大至中国的遮羞物；第二，以“非常迅速的速率”在全世界加强侵略军事力量，首先是所谓“比以前更需要马上建立一支最高司令部统一指挥下的欧洲联军”；第三，大大增加美国扩军的速度与规模，杜鲁门为此特别声明：“我将提出一个补充要求，要求拨出为立即扩大我国武装部队并提高其效能所需的款项。我希望明天即与国会各领袖会商，要求他们立即考虑这些拨款。”而当杜鲁门在记者招待会上回答问题时，竟明目张胆地表示“联合国面前的事乃是要对中共采取行动”。杜鲁门甚至威胁地说：“从军事观点着眼，一切武器都必须加以考虑”。
    不论杜鲁门、艾奇逊、麦克阿瑟之流如何装腔作势，但是美国资产阶级的喉舌合众社，却比较直率地道破了这些狂妄的侵略分子的志大才疏，合众社二十八日在计算美帝一旦发动大战所将遭遇到的严重困难时承认：“拥有亿万人口的亚洲将是吸收西方战斗人力的泥沼”，而西欧又“仅有很少数毫无组织与训练的军队，其中很多装备很差”。如果一旦发生战争“这些军队对于苏军将是束手待毙的鸭子”。合众社指出：“这种困难只要说出一部分来就足以使最顽硬的西方官员发抖”。而杜鲁门与艾奇逊在其演说中所不得不再要求加强美国与西欧军事力量的叫嚣，却正是表示着这种“发抖”。
