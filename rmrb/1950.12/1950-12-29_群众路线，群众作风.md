    Tibetan Area Correspondence
    
    The Mass Line, The Mass Style
    By Our Reporter with the Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group, Shen Shi
    
    A certain A-le from a unit of the People's Liberation Army told the reporter: The commanders and fighters of my unit stationed in Batang helped a local Tibetan resident harvest highland barley. They cut and bundled the barley and delivered it to the old man's home. The old folks were extremely moved. Because they didn't understand each other, the old folks didn't know how to express their gratitude, so they just cried.
    
    When I was in Garzê, Xu Dawen, the military representative of Garzê County, told the reporter many stories about how the Tibetan people loved the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. When our garrison was short of food, eating wild vegetables and field mice, the local residents voluntarily brought butter and tsampa to comfort our army. They said, "We have never seen such a good government." "We have never seen such a good army." They called the working comrades of the People's Government and the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army "New Han people."
    
    Why, in just half a year, has the long-standing estrangement between the Han and Tibetan peoples begun to improve? This is certainly the result of the hard work of all the commanders, fighters, and working comrades in the Tibetan areas, and it is certainly the inevitable harvest of correctly implementing the national policy. But it is inseparable from the fact that Miao Fengshu, director of the Kangding Military Control Commission, and Sangji Yexi (Tianbao), the current chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government of Xikang Province, and Fan Zhizhong, commander of the military sub-district, often contacted the masses and always considered them. During my contact with them, I deeply felt this.
    
    One afternoon, comrades from the Central Visiting Group went to Chairman Tianbao to ask him about the situation in Garzê. While they were talking vigorously, Chairman Tianbao suddenly took out a silver "Ga Wu" from his arms. He said: "This was brought to me by a living Buddha from Zhanhua. The living Buddha also told me to wear it, so I followed his words and have been wearing it for some time. I heard that the living Buddha was very happy when he heard about it."
    
    The day Tianbao left Garzê to return to Kangding, the reporter went to see him. His small building was crowded with people seeing him off. There were lamas, old living Buddhas from Zhanhua, and many Tibetan women. They surrounded Tianbao, talking endlessly, which kept the translator Dianzun Jiacuo busy. As they were talking enthusiastically, a woman in her forties, holding her eleven-year-old child, also came to see him off. The child was named Lang Sui, and her mother was Yang Zhuoma. As soon as Yang Zhuoma saw Chairman Tianbao, she took out a Hada from her body, warmly presented it to Chairman Tianbao, and said slowly, "Tianbao! You are so good, even closer than our relatives! Next time you come to Garzê, you must come to my house again!" More and more people came, and even the door was crowded. The car was about to leave, and the people seeing him off followed him all the way to the car. The engine started, and the people in the car waved and kept shouting, "Goodbye! Goodbye!" The people seeing him off on the roadside also waved and shouted back, "Ga lie pei! Ga lie pei!" (Go slowly! Go slowly!) Eleven-year-old Lang Sui also mingled in the crowd and greeted Tianbao kindly: "Tianbao, ga lie pei!"
    
    Dianzun Jiacuo told the reporter: Whether Chairman Tianbao is in Garzê or Kangding, Tibetan compatriots go to him every day. Some accuse him of the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, and some discuss various issues with him. Chairman Tianbao patiently comforts them and solves their related problems. At the same time, he always takes some time every day to visit Tusi and headmen's homes and visit lama temples to listen to the opinions of all levels.
    
    Wearing a set of clothing that is stained with oil and almost black, whenever he passes by on the street, people who know him say that this is Committee Member Tianbao, and people who don't know him think of him as an ordinary soldier. This is such a soldier whose mind is often occupied by the broad masses of Tibetan people.
    
    One evening, the reporter went to visit Director Miao Fengshu. After talking for a while, the door opened, and a man wearing old sheepskin Tibetan clothing walked in. Director Miao greeted him very warmly, asking him his name, where he lived, and what he wanted. The guest spoke. He was called Jiangyang, a herdsman from the Daofu cattle farm. His cattle had been stolen, and he asked Director Miao to find a solution. Before he finished speaking, he knelt down on both knees. Director Miao hurriedly helped him up, comforted him gently, saying that he had known about his matter two days ago, but because he was busy with the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, he did not deal with it immediately, and expressed to him that he must deal with it quickly and well. The herdsman was so moved that he cried. Before leaving, he kowtowed to Director Miao again. Director Miao said: In the future, don't kowtow to us public servants anymore. We are here to do things for you Tibetan people, and sent him to the door.
    
    Less than five minutes later, Yixi Duoji, the representative from Luhuo, arrived. What he discussed was the issue of candidates from Luhuo County to participate in the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government. Director Miao solicited his opinions and asked him to submit a list of personnel to participate in government work.
    
    Just after sending away Yixi Duoji, Tusi Chongxi from Yajiang County came to see him again. In less than an hour, he received four groups of Tibetan compatriots.
    
    Angwang Gesang, Secretary-General of the Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government, told reporters: It has become a custom for Chairman Tianbao and Director Miao to receive compatriots from all circles, including Tibetan, Han, Hui, and Yi, at any time. Everyone who comes out of Director Miao's and Chairman Tianbao's living room has a smile on their face.
    
    In Kangding in late autumn and early winter, the weather is cold enough, and the working comrades are still wearing the clothes that were worn out in northwest Shanxi. This style of hard work and simplicity, this constant and close contact with the masses, unites the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups around the People's Government and unanimously recognizes that the People's Government is a government that truly does things for the people.
    
    From the various preparatory work before the convocation of the First People's Representative Conference of All Circles of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, the reporter deeply felt how the working comrades of the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army are deeply considering the future welfare of the people of all ethnic groups and circles in this region, and how they are carefully calculating the various budget of the People's Government's future work, fearing that they will waste even a penny of the Tibetan people and fearing that they will increase the burden on the people.
    
    Chairman Tianbao once humbly said to the reporter: "In the initial period of our work in the Kangding area, we were busy taking over the city, raising grain, firewood, and grass, and supporting the advance into Tibet. Then we prepared for the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government. Now the new government has been established, but neither the Kangding Military Control Commission nor the Kangding Local Committee of the Communist Party of China has established a series of working systems. There are still more or less guerrilla styles from the wartime countryside in our work. In the future, we must absorb advanced experience from all over the world to gradually make our work standardized and institutionalized."

    群众路线，群众作风
    本报随中央西南各民族访问团记者  沈石
    人民解放军某部阿乐告诉记者：我进驻巴塘的某部指战员，给当地一家藏族居民收获青稞，他们将青稞割好、捆好，送到老乡家中，老乡们感动极了，因为两方面说话都不懂，老乡们不知道要怎样才能表达他们的感激，便痛哭了一场。
    记者在甘孜时，甘孜县军事代表徐达文告诉记者许多关于藏族人民热爱人民政府和人民解放军的事迹。我驻军一时缺乏粮食，吃野菜，吃山鼠，当地居民便自动地拿出酥油、糌粑来慰问我军。他们说：“从来没有见过这样好的政府。”“从来没有见过这样好的部队。”他们叫人民政府工作同志和人民解放军指战员做“新汉人”。
    为什么仅仅半年的时间就使汉、藏两民族相沿已久的隔阂开始改善了呢？这固然是藏族地区全体指战员和工作同志艰苦奋斗的成绩，固然是正确执行民族政策的必然收获，但与康定军管会苗逢澍主任及现任西康省藏族自治区域人民政府桑吉悦希（天宝）主席和军分区司令员樊执中等经常联系群众和处处为群众着想分不开的，记者和他们接触中，深深地体会了这一层。
    一个下午，中央访问团的同志到天宝主席那里，请他谈谈甘孜的情况，谈得正起劲时，天宝主席忽的从他的怀里掏出一个银质的“呷乌”来，他说：“这是瞻化一个活佛托人捎给我的。活佛还嘱咐我，叫我挂在身上，我就照着他的话，已经挂了一些时日，听说活佛听了还很高兴。”
    天宝主席从甘孜动身回康定的那一天，记者去看他。他那狭小的楼房里，挤满了送行的人。有喇嘛，有从瞻化来的老活佛，还有许多藏族妇女，他们围着天宝，滔滔地说个不休，这却忙煞了译话的滇尊嘉楚。正在谈得起劲的时候，一位四十来岁的妇女，挽着她十一岁的孩子也来送行了。这个孩子名叫朗绥，她母亲叫阳卓马。阳卓马一看见天宝主席，从她身上掏出一条哈达，亲热地送给天宝主席，并慢吞吞地说：“天宝！你太好了，比我们的亲人还亲热哩！下次到甘孜，要再来我家里坐坐呵！”人越来越多，连门外也挤满了人。汽车快开了，送行的人都跟着他，一直送他到车上。马达响了，车上的人都在招手，不断地喊着：“再见！再见！”路旁送行的也在招手，回喊着：“嘎列配！嘎列配！”（慢慢走！慢慢走！）十一岁的朗绥也杂在人丛中亲切地向天宝招呼：“天宝，嘎列配！”
    滇尊嘉楚告诉记者：不管天宝主席在甘孜，或者在康定，每天都有藏族同胞去找他，有的向他控诉国民党反动统治者的罪恶，有的和他商量各种问题，天宝主席耐心地劝慰他们，给他们解决有关的问题。同时他每天总得挤出一些时间来，到土司、头人家走走，到喇嘛寺走走，听取各阶层的意见。
    穿着一身油渍得快要发黑的服装，每当他打从街头经过时，知道他的人，说这就是天宝委员，不知道他的人，把他当作一般战士。就是这样一位战士，他的脑子，经常被广大藏族人民占据着。
    一个晚上，记者去访问苗逢澍主任，谈了一阵，门开了，一位身着老羊皮藏服的人走进来，苗主任很亲热地招待他。问他叫什么名字，家在那里，找他有什么事情。这位客人讲话了，他叫降央，是道孚牛场上的牧民。他的牛被人偷去了，请求苗主任设法解决。话还没有说完，就双膝跪在地上。苗主任急急忙忙把他搀起来，委婉地安慰他，说他的事情两天前就知道了，因为忙着各界人民代表会议，没有立刻来处理，并向他表示说，一定要很快地处理，一定要处理得很好。这位牧民感动得哭起来，临走时，又向苗主任磕了一个头。苗主任说：以后再不要向我们公家人磕头了，我们到这里是为你们藏族人民办事情的。并且送他到门口。
    坐了不到五分钟，炉霍的代表益喜多吉来了。他所商谈的，是炉霍县参加藏族自治区域人民政府的人选问题，苗主任征求了他的意见，并且请他提出了一批参加政府工作的人员名单。
    刚刚送走了益喜多吉，雅江县的崇喜土司又来见他了。不到一个钟头，就接见了四批藏族同胞。
    藏族自治区域人民政府秘书长昂旺格桑告诉记者：天宝主席和苗主任随时接见藏、汉、回、彝各界同胞，已成为惯例，凡从苗主任和天宝主席客厅里走出来的，没有一个不面露笑容的。
    秋末冬初的康定，天气是够冷的，工作同志们还是穿着在晋西北穿破了的那套衣服，这种艰苦朴素的作风，这种经常和群众保持密切联系，使各族各界广大人民，团结在人民政府周围。并一致认识到人民政府是真正替人民办事的政府。
    从西康省藏族自治区域第一届各界人民代表会议召开前的各种筹备工作当中，记者深刻地体会到人民政府和人民解放军的工作同志是怎样为这一地区各族各界人民今后的福利在深谋远虑，对于人民政府今后工作的各项预算，是怎样在精打细算，惟恐多浪费藏族人民的一文钱，惟恐加重人民的负担。
    天宝主席曾谦虚地向记者说：“我们最初一个时期在康定地区的工作，是忙于接管城市，忙于筹措粮食柴草和支援进军西藏。接着就筹备成立自治区域人民政府。现在新的政府已经成立了，但是，不管在康定军管会或中共康定地方委员会，还没有建立起一系列的工作制度，我们工作中还存在着或多或少战时农村中的游击作风。今后，我们要吸收各地的先进经验，使我们各项工作逐步走向正规化、制度化。”
