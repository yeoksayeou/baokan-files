Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 19th: Forty thousand people from 134 industries and businesses in Nanjing held a patriotic demonstration and parade on the 18th to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The parade was led by the entire committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. Among the ranks were elders in their seventies. Businesspeople from Ma'anshan, Longtan, and other places traveled from over 60 *li* away to Nanjing to participate in the demonstration. In the parade, the Xinhua Firefighting Equipment Factory carried a large fire extinguisher with the words "Extinguish the Flames of US Imperialist War" and "Eliminate the Fierce Flames of Aggression" written on it. The department store contingent had over a dozen people carrying a large cartoon, eighteen *chi* high and twelve *chi* wide, depicting how US imperialism dumped various American goods, from women's socks to rouge and lipstick, in China, thereby forcing Chinese national industries and businesses to close down. The marching crowds shouted slogans such as "Fulfill Patriotic Pledges," "Guarantee Completion of Tax Revenue Tasks," "Stabilize Prices," and "Demand Blood Debt Repayment from US Imperialism." Citizens along the way set off firecrackers and presented flowers to the marching crowds to pay their respects. Before the parade, a conference was held and a telegram of respect was sent to Chairman Mao.

    南京工商业界四万人举行反帝爱国大游行
    【新华社南京十九日电】南京市工商界一百三十四个行业四万人，于十八日举行抗美援朝反对美帝国主义侵略的爱国示威大游行。游行队伍以市工商联合会全体委员为前导。行列中有七十多岁的老者。马鞍山、龙潭等地的工商业者从六十里地以外赶来南京参加示威游行。在游行队伍中，新华消防器材厂抬着一个大型的消防器，上面写着：“扑灭美帝战火”、“消除侵略凶焰”。百货业的行列，十几个人抬着一幅高十八尺宽十二尺的大漫画，描绘着美帝国主义如何将从女袜到胭脂、口红的各种美货在中国倾销，因而迫使中国民族工商业倒闭的罪行。游行队伍沿途高呼“履行爱国公约”、“保证完成税收任务”、“稳定物价”、“向美帝国主义索还血债”等口号。沿途市民纷纷燃放爆竹和向游行队伍献花致敬。在游行前，曾举行大会，通过向毛主席致敬的电文。
