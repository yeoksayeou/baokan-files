    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 9th: The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions has passed a declaration to all trade union organizations and working people of the world. The declaration is as follows:
    Workers, both men and women! Working people of all countries! The threat of war is intensifying. American imperialists are spreading death and destruction in Korea, threatening the whole world with a brutal war. Only the people themselves can close the road to war.
    You, the millions of working men and women, possess the great power of humanity. Destiny is in your hands.
    You must take immediate and effective action against war, because you will be the first to bear the burden of war.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on you to take action to defend peace, to defend the lives of your children, and to protect the fruits of your creative labor.
    The Second World Peace Congress has shown the will of hundreds of millions of ordinary people around the world, who have taken the cause of defending peace into their own hands and resolutely oppose the evil actions of the imperialists. With this goal in mind, the Warsaw Congress has formulated a program for rapid and effective action. If this program is implemented, peace can be guaranteed.
    Unite with peace supporters in all countries to achieve an unconditional ban on atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, poison gas, radiation, and other tools of mass slaughter.
    Let us warn the warmongers: the first to use such weapons will be listed as war criminals by mankind and will be severely punished for their brutal atrocities.
    Take immediate action to smash Truman's criminal plan against the freedom- and independence-loving people of Korea and the people of China. Fight for the reduction of all armed forces, including ground forces, air forces, and navies, and for the establishment of strict international control over universal disarmament.
    Working people!
    Refuse to produce armaments. Remember that war means death, destruction, and immeasurable sacrifice and suffering for the people.
    Demand condemnation of armed aggression and interference in the internal affairs of all countries. The people of every country have the right to freedom and independence.
    Firmly demand an immediate end to the Korean War, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and the peaceful resolution of the internal conflict between the two sides in Korea with the participation of representatives of the Korean people.
    All peoples who have experienced the horrors of the Second World War, those who wish to prevent their families from suffering the horrors of war, cannot and should not remain indifferent to the fate of the Korean people who reasonably hope to freely determine their own destiny.
    Working people of the world!
    The imperialists have once again assigned the task of aggressive nations to West Germany and Japan. In order to launch a war of slaughter, they are restoring the industries and armed forces of these two countries. You must be vigilant! You must openly oppose the imperialists' evil plans to establish their hegemony and expand their wealth at the cost of the bloodshed of the working people.
    Remember the horrors caused by the Nazi barbarians and the Japanese militarists, and all the misfortunes that the working class in many countries still suffers.
    Expose the lies and propaganda of the enemies of peace, demand a ban on such propaganda, and hold those who commit the crime of promoting a new war accountable to the strictest penalty.
    The people of all countries, regardless of their government systems, can and need to cooperate peacefully and maintain close relations. Demand the restoration and development of normal trade relations between countries, and strengthen cultural relations between the people of all countries in order to achieve mutual understanding and trust in the common struggle for peace.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all trade union organizations and all working people to endorse the appeal to the United Nations made by the Second World Peace Congress. Only through joint efforts can a policy of peace be realized and friendly cooperation between the people of all countries be achieved.
    Trade unions of all countries!
    Strengthen the activities of peace committees in all enterprises and institutions, and establish peace committees where they do not yet exist. Enlist the broad masses of working people in the peace movement!
    Working men and women!
    The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on you to strengthen the unity of your ranks in the struggle for peace, for the realization of your vital demands, and for the improvement of your social and economic conditions.
    The struggle for peace and the struggle to improve living conditions are inseparable, just as the victory of this struggle is inseparable from strengthening the unity of the working people of all countries and internationally.
    Help build a strong movement for the unity of working people, and strengthen the joint action of the working class and farmers.
    Cooperate closely with the broad masses of peace supporters and all peace-loving progressive forces.
    Resolutely expose the warmongers and their running dogs in the trade union movement who seek to divide the working class in order to weaken its strength and help launch a new war.
    To fight for peace and against war is the duty of every working person.
    Everything for the defense of peace!
    Long live peace and friendship among the people of all countries!

    世界工联执行局通过宣言
    号召各国劳动人民展开行动保卫和平粉碎杜鲁门侵略中国朝鲜的罪恶计划
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布加勒斯特九日电：世界工联执行局顷通过告全世界工会组织和劳动人民的宣言。宣言如下：
    男女工人们！各国的劳动人民！战争的威胁加紧了。美国帝国主义者正在朝鲜散布死亡和毁灭，用残酷的战争威胁着全世界。只有人民自己才可以封闭走向战争的道路。
    你们，千百万劳动男女们，拥有人类伟大的力量。命运是掌握在你们手里。
    你们必须立即有效地去反对战争，因为最先负起战争重担的便是你们。
    世界工联要求你们，为了保卫和平，为了保卫你们孩子们的生命必须采取行动，以保护你们的创造性劳动的果实。
    二届世界保卫和平大会已经表明了全世界亿万普通人民的意志，他们把保卫和平的事业掌握在自己的手里，坚决地反对帝国主义者的罪恶行动。华沙大会怀着这个目标，已经制订了迅速有效行动的纲领。尚若贯彻这个纲领，和平就可以得到保障。
    与各国和平拥护者们团结一致，以达成无条件地禁止原子武器，细菌武器，化学武器，毒气，放射能，以及其它大规模屠杀的工具。
    让我们向战争贩子们提出警告：最先使用这种武器的人，将被人类列为战犯，并将因他的残酷暴行受到严厉的惩罚。
    立即展开行动，以便粉碎杜鲁门对保卫自由与独立的朝鲜人民和中国人民的罪恶计划。要为裁减地面部队，空军和海军等一切武装力量而斗争，为对普遍裁军建立严格的国际管制而斗争。
    劳动人民们！
    拒绝生产军备。记取战争便是死亡，毁灭，使人民遭受到不可估计的牺牲和苦难。
    要求谴责武装侵略和谴责干涉各国人民的内政。每一国家的人民都有着自由和独立的权利。
    坚决要求立即停止朝鲜战争，从朝鲜撤出外国军队，在朝鲜人民代表的参加下，用和平方法解决朝鲜双方的内部冲突。
    曾经经历第二次世界大战的恐怖的一切人民，希望防止他们的家庭免受战争恐怖的人们，对于合理地希望自由决定他们自己命运的朝鲜人民的命运，不能也不应该保持漠不相关的态度。
    全世界劳动人民们！
    帝国主义者们已再度为西德和日本派定了侵略国家的任务，为了发动屠杀的战争，他们正恢复这两个国家的工业和武装力量。你们须要警惕！须要公开表示反对帝国主义者为了设法建立他们的霸权和扩充他们的财富而以劳动人民的流血作为代价的罪恶计划。
    记取纳粹野蛮匪徒和日本军阀所造成的恐怖，以及许多国家的工人阶级至今还身受着的一切不幸的后果。
    揭穿和平的敌人的造谣宣传，要求禁止这种宣传，并使犯有宣传新战争的罪行的人们担负最严厉的责任。
    各国人民，不论政府制度如何，都能够而且需要和平合作及保持亲密的关系。要求恢复和发展各国间正常的贸易关系，加强各国人民之间的文化关系，以达到在争取和平的共同斗争中建立相互的了解和信任的目的。
    世界工联号召一切工会组织和一切劳动人民拥护二届世界保卫和平大会致联合国组织的呼吁书。只有用共同的努力，才能实现和平政策，才能达成各国人民间的友好合作。
    各国的工会！
    在各企业和各机关中加强和平委员会的活动，在还没有建立和平委员会的地方把和平委员会建立起来。吸收广泛的劳动人民群众加入和平运动！
    劳动男女们！
    世界工联号召你们，在为争取和平，争取实现你们切身的要求，争取改善你们的社会条件和经济条件而进行的斗争中，加强你们的队伍的团结。
    为和平而斗争和为改善生活条件而斗争是分不开的，正如这一个斗争的胜利和加强各国和国际劳动人民的团结是分不开的一样。
    帮助建立劳动人民团结的强大运动，加强工人阶级和农民的共同行动。
    与和平拥护者们的广大群众，与一切爱好和平的进步势力密切合作。
    坚决揭露战争贩子们及其在工会运动中的走狗，他们设法分裂工人阶级，以便削弱它的力量，来有助于发动新战争。
    为和平与反对战争而斗争，是每一个劳动人民的义务。
    一切为了保卫和平！
    各国人民的和平与友好万岁！
