Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: The All-China Federation of Cooperatives (hereinafter referred to as the National Cooperative Federation) held its first meeting of the Provisional Council in Beijing from November 27th to 30th. The council members present were Bo Yibo, Cheng Zihua, Xue Muqiao, Teng Daiyuan, Yao Yilin, Wu Juenong, Zhang Qinqiu, Liu Ziju, Deng Jie, Li Zheren, Meng Yongqian, Liang Yao, Yang Gangyi, Zhang Lisen, Yan Guhang, Chen Yifan, Xu Yongzhi, Guo Shurui, Wang Chun, Zhu Zemin, He Zhiping, Chen Naijun, a total of twenty-two people. Seven supervisors attended as non-voting delegates: Ye Jizhuang, Yu Shude, Liu Jingfan, Sha Qianli, Sun Xiaocun, Li Jiebo, and Zeng Xianzhi.

The meeting listened to Council Member Meng Yongqian's work report on the four months since the First National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference (the full text of the report can be found on page two), discussed and approved the 1951 Cooperative Development Plan, the North China and East China Cooperative's exchange of goods plan, and the key distribution plan for the first quarter of 1951. It was also decided to convene a business meeting of the main provincial and municipal cooperatives across the country on December 15th to specifically arrange the procurement, distribution, and other business work for the first quarter of next year. This meeting approved the direct participation of the cooperative federations of five provinces and two cities in North China as members of the National Cooperative Federation, while the cooperative federations of the major administrative regions and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region participated in the National Cooperative Federation as members by region. The meeting elected Bo Yibo as the chairman of the National Cooperative Federation Council, Cheng Zihua, Meng Yongqian, and Liang Yao as vice chairmen, and elected Liu Lantao as a council member. Bo Yibo, Cheng Zihua, Liu Lantao, Yao Yilin, Meng Yongqian, Liang Yao, and Li Zheren were elected as standing council members to organize the standing council to preside over the day-to-day work of the National Cooperative Federation. Finally, the meeting also approved in principle the organizational regulations and staffing plan of the National Cooperative Federation.

    The direction and route have been clarified, today's problem is to do a good job in business.

The meeting decided that the 1951 cooperative development plan would only be approved in principle in order to send this plan to the major regions first, to broadly collect opinions from the bottom up, so that it could be more suitable for actual needs, and then to formulate a formal plan. The meeting pointed out that the National Cooperative Conference in July had made a preliminary summary of the past work and revised the draft Cooperative Law, and the issue of the direction and route of cooperative development had been clarified. The central issue today is how to learn to do business and do a good job in the cooperative's business.

    Under the unified leadership of the National Cooperative Federation, exchange goods between regions in a planned way.

Regarding the plan for the exchange of goods between Northeast, North China, and East China, it was stipulated that from the latter half of November 1950 to the end of June 1951, under the unified leadership of the National Cooperative Federation, the Northeast Federation would organize the transportation and sale of 100,000 tons of bean cake, 100,000 tons of soybeans, and 100,000 tons of sorghum and corn to meet the needs of the members of the North China and East China cooperatives. At the same time, the East China Federation and the cooperatives of various provinces (cities) in North China would organize 2 million catties of ginned cotton and 600,000 bolts of various fabrics to meet the needs of the members of the Northeast cooperatives. This exchange of goods strictly implemented the spirit of the higher-level cooperatives serving the lower-level cooperatives and the grassroots cooperatives serving the members, as well as the cost accounting system, turning disorganized and unplanned exchanges into organized and planned exchanges, so that the members' lack of goods was supplied and the slow-selling goods were sold. This is of great significance to bringing the cooperative business of Northeast, North China, and East China onto the right track.

    Several daily necessities should be sold at low prices with fixed quotas.

The meeting also pointed out that cooperatives should implement a system of selling several daily necessities at low prices with fixed quotas, first ensuring the fixed quota supply for members of consumer cooperatives in factories, government agencies, and schools, and a portion of the members of rural supply and marketing cooperatives. It was decided to first conduct pilot projects with key points in cities and villages in the first quarter of next year, and then promote it after gaining experience. Distribution must be quota-based and priced, and only members can enjoy this preferential treatment. The distribution system can promote the cooperatives to get on the right track in terms of organization and business. Because distribution requires accurate statistics, the implementation of distribution is also a central link in making cooperative trade move from disorganized and unplanned to organized and planned. At the same time, low-priced distribution will inevitably promote the widespread development of cooperatives.

    Should adopt the method of buying on credit to revitalize trade between urban and rural areas.

The meeting discussed the method of cooperatives adopting the method of buying on credit to revitalize trade between urban and rural areas and between regions. This year, the whole country has had a bumper harvest, and the peasants have a large number of products in their hands that they are eager to sell. Cities also need a large amount of grain, raw materials, and native products to meet industrial needs and to promote sales abroad. The current difficulty is the lack of funds in cities. Therefore, cooperatives should adopt the method of buying on credit, purchasing some grain, cotton, and native products from peasants on credit, transporting and selling them to cities, and then repaying the peasants with various industrial products to solve the various necessities needed by the peasants. In this way, the problem of slow sales of agricultural products can be solved by the peasants' own strength, and urban and rural trade can be revitalized.

    Should purchase and sell according to the needs of the members, and oppose the pursuit of high profits.

The meeting emphasized that cooperatives at all levels in various regions should continue to implement the policy of "concentrating all efforts to meet the needs of members" of the National Cooperative Conference in July, and resolutely overcome the capitalist thinking of not purchasing and selling goods according to the needs of members and being busy with market activities. The meeting emphasized that cooperatives must strengthen economic accounting, reduce unnecessary circulation links of commodities, specifically stipulate the profit margins of cooperatives at all levels, and resolutely oppose the tendency to pursue high profits in order to correctly grasp the wholesale and retail prices of cooperatives and enable cooperative members to obtain practical material benefits. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to firmly grasp these links in order to realize the policy of "higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives, and grassroots cooperatives serving members" put forward by the National Cooperative Conference in July, to bring cooperatives in various regions onto the right track, and to truly improve a step forward in work.

    中华全国合作社联合总社            
    召开临时理事会第一次会议            
    讨论通过一九五一年合作社发展计划
    【本报讯】据新华社十五日讯：中华全国合作社联合总社（简称全国合作总社）于十一月二十七日至三十日在京召开临时理事会第一次会议。出席理事薄一波、程子华、薛暮桥、滕代远、姚依林、吴觉农、张琴秋、刘子久、邓洁、李哲人、孟用潜、梁耀、杨刚毅、张立森、阎顾行、陈一帆、徐咏之、郭?瑞、王纯、朱则民、贺致平、陈乃君等二十二人。列席监事叶季壮、于树德、刘景范、沙千里、孙晓村、李颉伯、曾宪植等七人。
    会议听取了孟用潜理事关于第一次全国合作社工作者代表会议以来四个月的工作报告（报告全文见第二版），讨论并通过一九五一年合作社发展计划，华北、华北、华东合作社的交换物资计划，一九五一年第一季度重点配售计划；并决定于十二月十五日召开全国主要省市合作社的业务会议，具体布置明年第一季度的采购配售及其他业务工作。此次会议通过华北五省二市合作总社直接参加全国合作总社为社员，各大行政区及内蒙自治区合作总社则以区为单位参加全国总社为社员。会议推选薄一波为全国合作总社理事会主任，程子华、孟用潜、梁耀为副主任，补选刘澜涛为理事，并选举薄一波、程子华、刘澜涛、姚依林、孟用潜、梁耀、李哲人为常务理事，组织常务理事会，主持全国合作总社的经常工作。会议最后并原则上通过了全国合作总社的组织规程及编制草案。
    方针路线已经明确了今天问题在搞好业务
    会议决定一九五一年合作社发展计划只作原则通过，是为了把这计划先发各大区，自下而上的广泛的搜集意见，使之能更适合于实际要求，然后再订出正式计划。会议指出，七月全国合作会议对过去工作已经做过初步总结，并修正了合作社法草案，合作社发展方针路线问题已经明确起来。今天的中心问题是如何学会做生意，将合作社的业务搞好。
    在全国总社统一领导下有计划地交换各地物资
    关于东北、华北、华东交换物资计划，规定自一九五○年十一月下旬开始，至一九五一年六月底止，在全国总社统一领导下，由东北总社组织运销豆饼十万吨，大豆十万吨，红粮、玉米十万吨，供给华北、华东社员需要，同时由华东总社及华北各省（市）社组织皮棉二百万斤，各种布六十万匹，供给东北社员的需要。这次物资交换，严格贯彻了上级社为下级社和基层社为社员服务的精神及成本核算制，把无组织无计划的交换变成了有组织有计划的交换，使社员缺乏的东西得到供给而滞销的东西得到出售，对东北、华北、华东合作业务的纳入正轨，是有重大意义的。
    几种生活必需品应廉价定量配售
    会议同时指出，合作社应实行几种生活必需品廉价的定量配售制，首先保证工厂机关学校消费社社员和一部分农村供销社社员的定量供给。决定明年第一季度在城市和乡村有重点地先行试办，取得经验后再行推广。配售必须定量定价，只有社员才能享受这种优待。配售制可以促使合作社在组织上和业务上走上正轨，并且由于配售需要正确的统计，所以实行配售也是使合作社贸易由无组织无计划走向有组织有计划的一个中心环节。同时廉价的配售必然会促成合作社的广泛发展。
    应采用赊购办法活跃城乡间贸易
    会议讨论了合作社采用赊购方式，活跃城乡和地区之间贸易的办法。今年全国丰收，农民手中掌握着大批产品急于出售，城市也需要大批粮食原料和土产以供工业需要和向外推销。目前的困难是城市资金缺乏，故合作社应采用赊购办法，向农民赊购一部分粮食、棉花和土产，运销到城市，然后用各种工业品偿付农民，以解决农民所需的各种必需品，这样用农民自己的力量来解决农产品的滞销问题，使城乡贸易活跃起来。
    应依社员需要进销反对追逐高额利润
    会议强调各地各级合作社应继续贯彻七月全国合作会议“集中全力满足社员需要”的方针，坚决克服不根据社员需要进销货物，忙于市场活动的资本主义思想。会议强调合作社必须加强经济核算，减少商品不必要的流动环节，具体规定各级合作社的利润率，坚决反对追逐高额利润的偏向，才能正确掌握合作社的批发和零售价格，使合作社社员得到实际的物质的实惠。会议指出必须紧紧掌握这几个环节，才能实现七月全国合作会议所提出的“上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务”的方针，才能将各地合作社纳入正轨，并在工作上真正提高一步。
