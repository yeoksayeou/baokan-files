Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th (TASS): The "Pravda" today published an editorial entitled "Prohibition of New War Propaganda!" which stated: The struggle to realize the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress is expanding in all countries, and these decisions are warmly supported by good people everywhere. Millions of people unanimously insist on the demands of the Second World Peace Congress to end the Korean War, condemn and prohibit aggression, unconditionally prohibit atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and reduce all armed forces. The decision to demand the prohibition of new war propaganda occupies an important place in the demands of the Second World Peace Congress.

Pravda pointed out that the United States is the center and hotbed of criminal war propaganda. The ruling clique of American imperialism spares no effort to poison the minds of the masses with toxic war propaganda, turning them into docile tools for implementing the imperialists' crazy adventure plan to establish world hegemony. The US government has spent a lot of money on war propaganda. Special institutions have been established for "psychological warfare" against the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism, and millions of copies of books praising war, oppression, and plunder have been printed. Thousands of newspapers controlled by monopoly capital carry out malicious slander propaganda against the Soviet Union and other democratic countries, and against the movement to defend peace, every day. Movies and radio stations are also in the hands of warmongers, becoming important tools for instilling fascist ideas.

The tycoons of monopoly capital in the United States and other imperialist countries are using all tools that can influence thought to achieve a single purpose: to train a generation of murderers to prepare to commit any crime to realize the plundering desires of Wall Street financiers.

The customary outbreak of war hysteria in the United States once again proves the great importance of the Second World Peace Congress's call to ban new war propaganda and pass laws to punish war propaganda. The Soviet Union, faithful to its policy of peace and friendship with all peoples, has repeatedly insisted in the United Nations that all forms of war propaganda must be condemned and prohibited, with criminal penalties as a warning, and all progressive mankind supports these peace-loving proposals of the Soviet Union. The powerful wave of anger of the people of all countries against Truman's war-mongering statement on November 30th proves the determination of millions of good people to defend peace. The people of all countries, all honest people in the world, resolutely protest against the war threats of arrogant American adventurers. Peace-loving people of all countries respond to the new war hysteria of the American ruling clique by further intensifying the struggle for peace. "Do not wait for peace, but fight for peace" - this fighting slogan of the Second World Peace Congress has inspired the hearts of millions of ordinary people. The struggle against the threat of new war is now being carried out by organized forces of peace, democracy, and socialism. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the wise leader of all progressive mankind and the great banner of peace, the heroic Soviet people are now and will continue to be at the forefront of the warriors of peace, and will unswervingly fight against the threat of new war.

Pravda continued, Truman, MacArthur, Harriman, and other officials in the US government on Wall Street used the Syngman Rhee clique's attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which they provoked, as an excuse to organize the US military to conduct plundering military operations in Korea and to invade China in Taiwan. The failures suffered by the US military in Korea are now being used by Truman and his accomplices as new excuses to further expand aggression and launch even more crazy military adventures. Pravda said that Truman needs war and not peace. This is the reason why he is going mad with new war. In his statement on November 30, the US President once again frantically demanded the most rapid increase in the military power of the United States and Marshallized countries, and Truman guaranteed to continue his imperialist conspiracies in Korea and against China. Following Truman, Acheson, Dulles, Austin, and other American warmongers violently demanded the expansion of aggression, even using the United Nations platform to carry out their criminal propaganda.

    禁止新战争宣传
    ·真理报社论·
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日电：真理报今日在题为“禁止新战争宣传！”的社论中说道：争取实现第二届世界保卫和平大会决议的斗争正在一切国家扩大中，这些决定到处都受到善良人民的热烈拥护。千百万人民都一致坚持第二届世界保卫和平大会关于结束朝鲜战争，谴责和禁止侵略，无条件禁止原子、细菌和化学武器及其他大规模毁灭的武器，裁减一切武装部队等要求。要求禁止新战争宣传的决定在第二届世界保卫和平大会的要求中占有重要的地位。
    真理报指出，美国是罪恶战争宣传的中心和温床。美帝国主义统治集团不遗余力以有毒的战争宣传来毒害群众的思想，把他们变为实施帝国主义者建立世界霸权的疯狂冒险计划的驯良工具。美国政府在战争宣传上花费了大量的金钱。为了对和平、民主和社会主义的力量进行“心理战”，特别的机构建立起来了，赞美战争、压迫和掠夺的书籍印发了数百万册。为独占资本所控制的数千家报纸，天天进行反对苏联及其他民主国家，及反对保卫和平运动的恶意的诽谤宣传。电影和电台也在战争贩子手中，成为灌输法西斯思想的重要工具。
    美国及其他帝国主义国家的独占资本大亨们，正利用一切能影响思想的工具来达到一个单一的目的：训练一代屠杀者来准备犯任何的罪行以实现华尔街财阀们的掠夺欲望。
    美国战争歇斯底里的照例突发再一次证明第二届世界保卫和平大会要求禁止新战争宣传及通过使战争宣传受惩罚的法律的号召所具有的巨大重要性。苏联忠实于其和平与各国人民友好的政策，已再三在联合国中坚持必须以刑事惩罚为戒，谴责和禁止一切形式的战争宣传，全体进步人类支持苏联的这些爱好和平的建议。各国人民对杜鲁门十一月三十日煽动战争声明的强大愤怒浪潮，证明了千百万善良人民保卫和平的决心。一切国家人民，全世界的所有正直人民都坚决地抗议傲慢的美国冒险家的战争恫吓。爱好和平的各国人民以更进一步加紧争取和平的斗争来答复美国统治集团的新战争歇斯底里。“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平”——第二届世界保卫和平大会的这个战斗号召已经鼓舞了千百万普通人民的心。反对新战争威胁的斗争现在正由有组织的和平、民主和社会主义力量进行中。英雄的苏维埃人民在全体进步人类的英明领袖、伟大的和平旗手斯大林的领导下，现在和将来都走在和平战士的前列，坚持不渝地为反对新战争威胁而斗争。
    真理报继称，杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、哈里曼及华尔街在美国政府中的其他官吏们利用他们所挑起的李承晚集团对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，作为组织美军在朝鲜进行掠夺军事作战及在台湾侵略中国的借口。美军现在在朝鲜所遭受的失败被杜鲁门及其同伙利用作为新的借口，来进一步扩大侵略及发动甚至更疯狂的军事冒险。真理报说，杜鲁门需要战争而不需要和平。这就是他大发新战争狂的原因。美国总统在他十一月三十日的声明中，再度疯狂地要求最迅速地增加美国和马歇尔化国家的军事力量，杜鲁门并保证继续他在朝鲜以及对于中国的帝国主义阴谋。紧接杜鲁门之后，艾奇逊、杜勒斯、奥斯汀及其他美国战争贩子狂暴地要求扩大侵略，甚至利用联合国的讲台来进行他们的罪恶宣传。
