Editor's Note: The following is a letter received by the "People's China" from an American reader, George Ouchinich (one of the American journalists who welcomed our representative Wu Hsiu-chuan at the New York airport), reporting on the arrival of our delegation at the New York airport and expressing the expectations of the American people for the Chinese delegation. The original letter will be published in Volume 3, Issue 1 of "People's China." The original letter is published below:

It was a great honor for me, as a journalist, to wait peacefully at the airport for the arrival of a British plane carrying the first genuine representatives of the Chinese people to our country. In the darkest hour before dawn, the station seemed desolate. The morning wind was cold, and planes were flying low overhead, preparing to land. At the entrance, under the watchful eyes of a row of police officers, over a hundred photographers, journalists, and government personnel stood in small groups, causing a silent stir. Movie cameras were already set up, and the atmosphere was tense and urgent.

The United Nations cars were ready, with their engines running. However, time had to be made for the Chinese delegation to talk to the press. Attendants laid a red carpet straight to where the plane would land. Photographic lights and the intense lights of the cars illuminated the plane's door, making the night as bright as day.

Seven men and two women emerged from the plane. In the dazzling light, we watched them slowly walk to the customs office. Not a word, not a question, broke the silence. These travelers left a deep mark of historical significance around them.

I thought of a plane that took me away from Yan'an, the capital of the Chinese People's Liberation Area, five years ago. And now, we have in our midst the representatives of the truly 475 million people, that is, representatives of one-quarter of humanity! I thought of my three children sleeping in their small beds; this plane from the East brought long-awaited messengers of peace, for my children and for all other children, sleeping and awake.

Historically, this is the first time China has spoken in America from the standpoint of the people. China will prove that her people are the strongest and most loyal friends of peace-loving and peace-creating people all over the world.

Representative Wu Hsiu-chuan, with the title of ambassador, said to the reporters and photographers crowding around the microphone:

"There has always been a deep friendship between the Chinese and American people. I would like to take this opportunity to pay my respects to the peace-loving American people."

Standing next to Representative Wu Hsiu-chuan was Soviet Representative Malik. The photographers said again and again, "Mr. Malik, please wait a moment, just one more photo." At that moment, he and Representative Wu Hsiu-chuan shook hands with smiles. In their handshake was laid the foundation for the close unity of one-third of humanity under the common goal—the banner of peace.

The Polish representative arrived, as did the representatives of Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia, and Ukraine. I was deeply sorry that not a single Western representative, especially not a representative of our country, was present. In my brief handshake with the two Chinese representatives, though no words were spoken, I wholeheartedly conveyed the deep meaning of welcome that I wanted to express, and that I believe you, the readers, also wanted to express. Sometimes, history gives us an opportunity to make amends for shortcomings; as an American who had signed the peace declaration, I and three other Americans filled this gap. One of them was Modroso, Executive Committee Member of the Far Eastern Democratic Politics Committee.

Our welcome was insufficient in number, but it was an outpouring of the American people's hope for peace. It brought blessings and success to the seven men and two women who brought a message of peace from afar, relating to the fate of our entire nation.

We welcome them with all our hearts and support their entire purpose.

The press interview was very short. The representatives were led to the cars, and the photographers were in a frenzy, constantly trying to get a good shot. At this moment, I said to myself:

"This is a photo of the faces of 475 million people."

From the faces I saw, I knew that these peace-loving, humane, friendly, warm, and hopeful people were extending their hands to shake hands with the peace-loving American people.

We wish you success in your mission, guests and representatives!

At 6:13 AM on Friday, November 24, 1950, you brought world history to America. We welcome it, and we will sincerely share it, and sincerely say that we know your mission will certainly be victorious because it is the true peace of humanity! (Translated by Yang Youluan)

### 在纽约机场上  迎接伍修权代表  一个美国记者的报道

    在纽约机场上
    迎接伍修权代表
    一个美国记者的报道
    编者按：这是“人民中国”社接到的美国读者乔治·乌奇尼奇（在纽约机场迎接我国伍修权代表等的美国记者之一）的来函，其中报道了我代表团到达纽约机场的情形，并表露了美国人民对中国代表团的期望。原信将载于三卷一期“人民中国”。现将原信发表如下：
    对我说是非常的荣幸，作一个记者，安心地在飞机场等待着一架英国飞机的到临，它将第一批真正中国人民的代表载到了我们的国度。在黎明前最黑暗的时候，站上显得很荒凉。晨风是冷飕飕的，头顶上飞机已在低飞降落。进口处，在一排警察的监视下，三五成群，站在那儿的一百多个摄影师，记者，和政府的人员们起了无声的骚动。拍电影的摄影机早安置好了，整个的气氛是紧张而又急迫的。
    联合国的汽车已预备好了，发动机都在动了。可是，还要腾出功夫，让中国代表团和新闻界交谈。服务员将红地毯直铺到飞机降落的地方。照像用的灯光和汽车的强度的灯光直射着飞机的门，使黑夜有如白昼。
    由飞机中走出来的是七位男的和两位女的，在耀眼的光亮中，我们目送他们慢慢的走到海关所。没有一个字，一句问询，打破了这沉寂。这些旅行者使他们周围的历史气氛留下了深刻的痕迹。
    我想起了五年前的一架飞机带我离开了中国人民解放区的首都延安，而现在在我们中间有了真正四万七千五百万人民的代表，也就是四分之一人类的代表啊！我想起了我的三个睡在小床上的孩子，这飞机从东方带来了久久盼望着的和平使者们，他们是为了我的孩子，也是为了所有别的睡着了和醒着的孩子们。
    在历史上，这是中国第一次站在人民的立场上，在美国发言。中国将会证明她的人民是全世界爱好和平、创造和平人们的最坚强、最忠实的好朋友。
    大使衔的代表伍修权，向挤在扩音器前的记者、摄影师们说：
    “中美两国人民从来就存在着深厚的友谊，我愿趁这个机会，向爱好和平的美国人民致敬”。
    站在伍修权代表旁边的是苏联代表马立克，摄影师们一次再次的说：“马立克先生，请等一等，再照一张照片”——就在这时候，他和伍修权代表含笑地握手了。在他们的握手中，奠定了三分之一人类在共同的目标——和平的旗帜下紧密的团结。
    波兰代表到场了，捷克，白俄罗斯，和乌克兰的代表都到了，深使我抱歉的是并没有一个西方的代表，特别是并没有我国的代表，在我和两位中国代表短短的握手中，虽然没有说话，我全心地将我所要表达的，我相信读者你们也同样要表达的欢迎的深意都放了进去。有时候，历史给予我们一个弥补缺陷的机会；作为一个曾在和平宣言上签了名的美国人，我和另外三个美国人填补了这缺陷。其中有一个是莫德罗素，远东民主政治委员会执行委员。
    我们的欢迎在数量上说是不足的，但它是美国人民盼望和平的流露。它将祝福和成功带给七个男的和两个女的，他们由远方带来了关系着我们整个国家命运的和平信息。
    我们用整个的好心去欢迎他们，同时支持他们的全部的目的。
    报纸的访问是很短的，代表们被领到汽车上，摄影师一团忙乱，在不断的想抢好镜头。这时，我对自己说：
    “这是照下了四万七千五百万人民的面目。”
    从我看见的这个面目，我知道了这些爱好和平的、人性的、友爱的、温暖的和充满了期望的人们是伸出了他们的手，他们要与爱好和平的美国人民握手。
    祝你们完成使命，客人们和代表们！
    一九五○年十一月二十四日星期五的早上六点十三分，你们将世界历史带到了美国。我们欢迎它，我们将诚心诚意地去分享它，同时诚心诚意地说，我们知道你们的使命是一定胜利的，因为它是人类真正的和平！  （杨友鸾译）
