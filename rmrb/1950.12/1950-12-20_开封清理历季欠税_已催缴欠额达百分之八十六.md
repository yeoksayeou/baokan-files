Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, December 18th: Kaifeng City, Henan Province, in its work to clear outstanding taxes, had cleared 86.48 percent of the total amount of fixed industrial and commercial tax arrears from the winter of 1948 to the summer of this year by December 3rd. The remaining amount is still being collected.

Kaifeng City had outstanding taxes for each season. By the beginning of October, the tax arrears had accumulated to more than 520,000 jin of wheat. Since the Central and South Military and Political Committee issued instructions in October regarding rectifying tax collection and clearing outstanding taxes, a "Fixed Industrial and Commercial Tax Arrears Clearing Committee" was formed under the personal leadership of the Deputy Mayor, composed of units such as the Tax Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Federation of Industry and Commerce. Arrears collection teams were established in each town to conduct thorough clearing: for individual cases where taxpayers were genuinely unable to pay due to excessive burden, reasonable consideration was given after investigation; for those who were able to pay but were waiting and delaying, education was conducted in conjunction with accounting investigations, and deadlines were set for payment; for vendors without fixed addresses, clearing was carried out household by household in conjunction with the Industry and Commerce Bureau's work of reissuing business licenses; for individual stubborn resisters who still refused to pay after education, they were dealt with according to the law. Due to the correct implementation of the policy of combining education and punishment, and with the assistance of relevant authorities and mass organizations, the work of clearing outstanding taxes has achieved great results.

    开封清理历季欠税
    已催缴欠额达百分之八十六
    【新华社开封十八日电】河南省开封市清理欠税工作，截至十二月三日止，已清理了自一九四八年冬季至今年夏季固定工商业税尾欠总额的百分之八十六点四八。余数正继续催缴中。
    开封市历季税收都有尾欠，至十月上旬，欠税曾积到小麦五十二万余斤。自十月间中南军政委员会颁布关于整顿税收清理欠税的指示后，在副市长亲自领导下，由税务局、公安局、工商联合会等单位组成“固定工商业税尾欠清理委员会”，并在各镇成立欠税催缴小组，进行彻底清理：对个别确因负担过重无力缴纳者，经调查后酌情予以合理照顾；对于有力缴纳而观望拖延者，结合算账调查，加以教育，并限期清缴；对于无固定地址的摊贩，结合工商局换发营业证工作，进行逐户清理；对个别刁顽延抗，经教育后仍不缴纳者，则依法处理。由于正确执行教育与惩罚相结合的政策，并取得各有关机关与群众团体的协助，此次清理欠税的工作已收到很大效果。
