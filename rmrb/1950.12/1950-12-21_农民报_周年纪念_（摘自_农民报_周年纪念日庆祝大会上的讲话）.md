    Anniversary of "Farmer's Daily"
    (Excerpt from a Speech at the Anniversary Celebration of "Farmer's Daily")
    --Comrades! The Party Central Committee has entrusted me to extend congratulations to all comrades of "Farmer's Daily" on the anniversary of the newspaper. "Farmer's Daily" was published in a relatively favorable period. Precisely at this time, in recent years, our newspaper circulation has increased rapidly. The material conditions of cities and villages have also improved, thus cultural demands have also increased. Of course, this demand is mainly reflected in subscribing to newspapers. Therefore, "Farmer's Daily" had a circulation of 50,000 copies when it began publication, and in one year the circulation has exceeded 500,000 copies. This alone demonstrates its farmer characteristics.
    Probably no one can estimate the significance of general newspapers, especially the significance of people's newspapers, as much as our Party Central Committee, which leads the Communist Party. It knows very well how to organize and prepare all forces to fight for the communist system in the future through newspapers.
    Recent facts still illustrate this point. Previously, our party could only be organized on the basis of propaganda and agitation, mainly through newspapers. However, at that time, we could only use newspapers intermittently. Only in individual periods did we utilize legal newspapers such as "Pravda" for several years, as well as the use of legal newspapers in individual periods – the spring of the 1905 Revolution. If the Central Committee had a good estimate of the significance of newspapers in the past, then how much greater is its significance now when newspapers truly possess the broad masses, when they not only play the role of elucidators but also become a great organizational means?
    In its first year, "Farmer's Daily" did a lot of work as a central aspect of rural organization. "Farmer's Daily" has done preparatory work this year, it has a foundation, and it is hoped that this newspaper can be completely independent, that it has found a fairly correct way to treat the peasant masses, and that it has found a way to connect the peasant masses with the newspaper.
    All of these give us confidence that this year the editorial department of "Farmer's Daily" will be able to achieve results no less than last year's in accordance with the established direction.

    “农民报”周年纪念
    （摘自“农民报”周年纪念日庆祝大会上的讲话）
    ——同志们！党中央委员会委托我向“农民报”全体同人祝贺本报的周年纪念日。“农民报”是在比较顺利的时期出版的。正在这时，在最近几年中，我们的报纸发行增加得很快。城市和乡村的物质条件也改善了，因此对文化的要求也提高了。当然，这一要求主要表现在订阅报纸上，因此“农民报”在开始出版时发行额即达五万份，一年来发行额已超过五十万份。这一点已说明它的农民的特点了。
    大概任何人对一般报纸的意义的估计，特别是对人民机关报的意义的估计，也不能像领导共产党的我们党中央委员会那样，它很知道怎样通过报纸组织和准备在以后为共产主义制度而斗争的一切力量。
    不久以前的事实还说明着这一点。以前我党只有在宣传鼓动的基础上才能组织起来，其中主要的是通过报纸，然而那时我们也只能间断地利用报纸，只有在个别的时期，我们有几年都利用着合法的报纸如“真理报”的出版，以及在个别时期里——一九○五年革命的春季里的合法报纸的利用。如果中央委员会在以前很好估计了报纸的意义，那么现在当报纸真正拥有广大群众的时候，当它不只起着阐明者的作用，而且也成为伟大组织手段的时候，它的意义该有多么大了呀？
    “农民报”在第一年中作为农村的组织的中心方面作了许多工作。“农民报”在这一年来已作了准备工作，已有基础，希望这个报纸能完全独立，希望它已找到了相当正确的对待农民群众的道路，希望它已找到了把农民群众和报纸联系起来的方法。
    所有这些都给我们以信心，相信在今年“农民报”编辑部按照既定方向将能获得不弱于去年的成绩。
