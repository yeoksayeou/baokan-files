To Catholic friends in all regions:

    Since Catholicism was introduced into China, imperialists have used the Church in every possible way as a vanguard for aggression. For example, France used the killing of priests as a pretext to launch wars of aggression, and after the war, it explicitly stipulated "the privilege of preaching in China" in unequal treaties, consciously carrying out conspiracies of sabotage. U.S. imperialism was particularly egregious, using money and various petty favors to lure people in the Church, with the intention of controlling the Chinese Church as an institution for long-term aggression and sabotage against our country.

    Now our independent, democratic, and free New China has been established. However, the imperialists hate to see the people turn over, deliberately expand the war of aggression, and disregard the repeated warnings of all peace-loving people in China, extending the flames of war to our northeastern border, bombing peaceful cities, and killing innocent compatriots. Therefore, based on our position of loving the motherland and the people, we resolutely sever all relations with the imperialists and eliminate pro-American, fearful of America, and flattering to America thoughts. We will rely on our own efforts to establish a self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating new Church. We will not allow the sanctity of the Church to be stained by imperialism again.

    Catholic friends, in order to get rid of the imperialists' conspiracy of aggression, we should actively support the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country with practical actions, consolidate the world's democratic peace camp, and work together to build a new China.

    We held a conference on November 30th and invited local leaders to provide guidance. All the Catholic friends who attended the meeting enthusiastically supported this movement. We hope you will actively respond to ensure the success of this movement and give us your good experiences at any time.

    Initiators: Wang Liangzuo (Chinese Priest), Shang Xizhu, Wang Fuchu, Sun Keqiang

### 四川广元天主教徒自立革新运动宣言

专栏：

    四川广元天主教徒
    自立革新运动宣言各地天主教教友们：
    天主教传入中国以后，帝国主义者即百般利用教会，作为侵略的先锋。如法国借口教士被杀而发动侵略战争，战后更在不平等条约上明文载定“在华传教特权”，有意识地进行阴谋破坏。尤以美帝国主义为甚，在教会中用金钱和各种不同的小恩小惠诱惑，其用意是要把持中国教会，作为长期对我国进行侵略破坏的机构。
    现在我们独立民主自由的新中国建立起来了。可是帝国主义者仇视人民翻身，蓄意扩大侵略战争，不顾全中国爱好和平人民屡次的警告，把战火烧到我国东北边境，轰炸和平城市，杀害无辜同胞，因此我们基于爱祖国爱人民的立场上，坚决与帝国主义者割断各方面的关系，并肃清亲美、恐美、媚美的思想。自力更生，建立自治、自养、自传的新教会。不让教会的圣洁，再受帝国主义的沾污。
    教友们，我们为要摆脱帝国主义者的阴谋侵略，更应当积极地以实际行动支持抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，巩固世界民主和平阵营，共同为建设新中国而奋斗。
    我们已于十一月三十日召开大会，并请当地首长莅临指导，到会教友，全体热烈支持此一运动，愿你们积极响应，确保此一运动的成功，并将你们的良好经验，随时赐教。
