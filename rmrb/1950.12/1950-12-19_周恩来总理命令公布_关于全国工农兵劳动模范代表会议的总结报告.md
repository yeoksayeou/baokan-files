This order.

Premier Zhou Enlai
December 14, 1950

The full text of Director Li Lisan's summary report is as follows:

All work of the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers has concluded. A summary of the proceedings is reported as follows:

(1) A total of 464 labor model representatives attended the conference, including 208 industrial model representatives, 198 agricultural model representatives, and 58 military labor model representatives. Among them, there were 49 female labor model representatives, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total. In terms of ethnicity, they included Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Korean, Kazakh, Uyghur, and Mosuo. In terms of region, representatives came from all provinces except Xikang and Hainan Island, and there were also representatives of labor models from Hong Kong. Among the industrial representatives, various industrial sectors had a considerable number of representatives. State-owned enterprises accounted for 87 percent, and private enterprises accounted for 13 percent. By composition, workers accounted for 54 percent, management personnel accounted for 16 percent, engineering and technical personnel accounted for 26 percent, and trade union workers accounted for 4 percent. Among the agricultural representatives, agriculture (including animal husbandry) accounted for 53 percent, forestry accounted for 28 percent, and water conservancy accounted for 19 percent. Farmers accounted for 80 percent, technical personnel accounted for 19 percent, and others accounted for 1 percent.

The conference opened on September 25 and closed on October 2, with activities lasting five days after the meeting. The representatives left Beijing on the 7th and returned to their respective areas, taking two weeks. During the conference, they attended the National Day ceremony, met Chairman Mao, listened to speeches by central leaders, and attended receptions and symposiums hosted by Chairman Mao, Soviet Ambassador Roschin, and other organizations. They visited factories and farms, toured the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace, and attended seven evening parties.

At the conference, 54 representatives spoke, introducing the deeds and experiences of labor models, and representatives from the Northeast and Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions reported on their experiences in organizing production competitions and new record movements. Finally, a summary of the conference was made, and a letter of tribute to Chairman Mao was adopted, which is the most important document reflecting the spirit of the conference. At the closing meeting, a joint letter was issued with the representatives of combat heroes' conference, entitled "Letter to the National Army and Laboring People," along with telegrams of "Supporting Korea Against American Aggression" and "Condolences to the Families of Martyrs and Disabled Soldiers." During the conference, 119 typical labor model materials and 395 summaries of deeds were distributed, and 35 booklets of typical figures were compiled, including 104 representatives of industrial and agricultural models. A commemorative publication of the conference is currently being edited. The exhibition of achievements of workers, peasants, and soldiers labor models, which was held simultaneously with the conference, had an average of over 10,000 visitors per day as of the end of October.

(2) Facts have proven that the convening of this conference was timely. After the State Council's decision was promulgated, there was a warm response throughout the country. Workers in many factories responded to this call with practical actions in production competitions. During the conference, factories, government offices, and schools in Beijing requested labor model representatives to speak, and a total of 20 lecture meetings were organized, with an audience of approximately 70,000 people. A total of 195 reporters and writers from news agencies, magazines, and various literary and artistic groups participated in the coverage of the conference. According to incomplete statistics, 528 news reports, features, communications, and interviews were released through news agencies, newspapers, and radio stations. Such a large-scale news activity with such a wide coverage was the first in the capital. It demonstrated the importance attached to the conference by all parties and reflected the enthusiastic sentiment of the masses. The broadcast of the conference's proceedings was warmly welcomed by the masses in various regions. Many local work cadres took time to listen. After hearing Chairman Mao's speech at the opening ceremony, workers and masses in some factories were very excited and automatically proposed to guarantee the completion and exceeding of production tasks.

(3) The mood of all the representatives, from beginning to end, was very full. Many representatives said that being able to come to Beijing, hold a meeting and speak in the Imperial Palace, and see Chairman Mao was something they had never dreamed of in the past. The representatives deeply felt that labor is glorious, the laboring people are respected, and they have truly turned over from a life worse than that of beasts. Therefore, they realized that the People's Government is truly their own government, and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are truly the saviors of the people. Many representatives were so excited that they couldn't sleep, especially the peasant representatives, many of whom sat up again in the middle of the night after going to bed. People who were usually quiet also spoke eloquently. Some representatives shook hands with Chairman Mao and were moved to tears. All of this expressed the masses' sincere love for their leader. Through this conference, the representatives' thinking was raised a step. Chairman Mao's instructions to build a strong national defense and a strong economic force became the unanimous thought of the representatives who attended the meeting. The representatives expressed their determination to increase production a step further when they returned, so as to make the country rich and the army strong. Many representatives repeatedly recited the leading, backbone, and bridge role of labor models and studied how to play these roles when they returned. Generally, they realized that no achievement can be created without the masses, and they all expressed the need to integrate with the masses. Although there were also a few representatives who developed a sense of pride, were nostalgic for the glamorous world of big cities, and were reluctant to return to the mountains, the conference basically achieved the purpose of commending meritorious officials, encouraging models, pointing out the direction, setting examples, and educating the masses.

(4) The preparation time for the conference was very rushed, but most regions implemented the instructions of the Government Administration Council and carried out this work seriously and conscientiously. However, individual regions showed a simple task viewpoint in the selection work and neglected the publicity and education work among the masses. As a result, the selected representatives did not meet the requirements, some representatives were not truly elected by the masses but were designated by higher authorities, and some individuals with poor political performance also became representatives. This showed that some places lacked the necessary seriousness and responsibility in the selection work, and it also showed that the work was not thorough, lacked inspection and timely summary, and the activists in the mass movement were not sufficiently understood.

There were many shortcomings in the organization and leadership of the conference. Several important documents were not prepared in advance, the organization work showed many chaotic phenomena, the publicity work was not well planned and organized, and the conditions for collective models were not clearly defined, making it difficult for various places to recommend. At the same time, the ideological leadership and assistance to the team leaders from various places were not timely enough, which led some comrades to regard themselves as representatives, compete for treatment, complain, fail to play their due role among the representatives, and increase some difficulties in the work.

(5) The following are some suggestions for the work to be carried out after the conference and the organization of labor model movements in the future for the central government and local governments to study:

(A) After the representatives returned, various places generally carried out a lot of publicity work, such as organizing mass welcome meetings and inviting representatives to give reports. However, we feel that it is not extensive and in-depth enough. Therefore, it is proposed that trade union organizations in various places should convene mass meetings or representative meetings in each factory and enterprise to convey the spirit of this conference, read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the conference and the conference's letter of tribute to Chairman Mao, and post it in every workshop and dormitory in the factory. Each trade union group should conduct a detailed discussion, select some typical model materials, and read one or two during the time when the masses go to and from work or eat, or when the club holds evening parties. When necessary and possible, organize group discussions to expand the impact of the conference and improve the understanding, awareness, and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses.

(B) Various places can use the influence of the conference to organize production competitions in various factories and enterprises and plan to gradually make it a regular movement, rather than allowing it to become a sporadic and sudden rush movement. In cities where production has normalized and trade union organizations have been generally established, the experience of Northeast China and Tianjin can be used to organize city-wide production competitions. However, such a competition is a very serious organizational work. To do a good job in such a competition, it must be led by the municipal federation of trade unions and initiated from the bottom up through trade union organizations. Sufficient preparation work must be carried out, and each factory, workshop, production team, and even each worker and staff member must formulate production plans or competition agreements. Attention must be paid to carrying out technical improvements and rationalization proposals in the competition movement, while avoiding simply and excessively increasing labor intensity. Attention must be paid to discovering various shortcomings in the production process and improving production and labor organization. Attention must be paid to improving product quality, rather than simply increasing quantity. Attention must be paid to establishing various systems, especially the responsibility system. Attention must be paid to gradually stipulating production quotas, promoting the piece-rate wage system, and formulating correct reward systems from the competition. Only in this way can the continuity of production competition and the continuous improvement of labor productivity be achieved, and the phenomenon of increasing quantity, decreasing quality, damaging machines, increasing sick numbers, and greatly reducing production after the competition can be avoided.

(C) The selection of labor models should be made into a fixed system. Labor models must be selected every time the production work is summarized, and this selection must rely on reliable records of daily production performance. Model figures who are representative should be selected from teams, workshops, and factories with production achievements, and then municipal, provincial, large administrative region, entire industry, and national labor models should be generated on this basis. Attention should be paid to the training and education of labor models, so that they can continuously improve their political, cultural, and technical level, continue to play their exemplary and leading role, avoid pride and complacency, strengthen contact with the masses, and maintain the glorious title of labor model forever.

(D) City-wide industrial labor models are best selected twice a year (once before May Day and once before National Day), and national industrial labor model conferences can be held once a year or every two years. The role of the national labor model conference is mainly to commend and encourage, because it includes people from all aspects, and it is impossible to deeply exchange experiences. The real exchange of experiences and promotion of advanced production methods should be held in accordance with the industrial system, so various industrial departments can also convene labor model conferences of their own industries when necessary.

(E) Farmers' labor model conferences should be held during slack farming seasons. In areas where land reform has been completed, it is best to hold them once a year at the district or county level. Provincial and national farmers' labor model conferences should only be convened when necessary, and there is no need to hold them every year. The selection of labor models should mainly focus on those who are good at playing a leading role, organizing the masses to implement unity and mutual assistance, improving the production of the entire village, or those who play a model role in improving farm tools and seeds, organizing sideline production, and planting trees and forests. Those who have made significant achievements in increasing production through personal diligent farming can also be recommended. In water management and river dredging, competitions can be organized in accordance with the methods in factories, and labor models can be selected. Labor model conferences can be held every time a project is completed to give material and honorary rewards. When necessary, joint labor model conferences in one or several regions can also be held to exchange experiences and encourage labor enthusiasm.

In addition, it is proposed that in the future, those who have contributed to production in various places should only be given the title of labor model, and not the title of labor hero. When conditions are ripe, the central government will issue measures for awarding the title of labor hero as the highest title for national labor model figures.

    关于全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的总结报告
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议筹备委员会主任李立三于十一月十七日在政务院第五十九次政务会议上所作《关于全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的总结报告》，由同次会议批准。十二月十四日周恩来总理发布命令，公布这个总结报告，作为今后全国进行劳模运动的指针。周恩来总理命令全文如下：
    关于全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的总结报告，业经政务院第五十九次政务会议批准，兹公布之，作为今后全国进行劳模运动的指针。
    此令
    总理  周恩来
    一九五○年十二月十四日
    李立三主任的总结报告全文如下：
    全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的一切工作均已结束，兹将经过情况扼要报告如下：
    （一）参加这次会议的劳动模范代表共四六四人，工业模范代表二零八人，农业模范代表一九八人，部队劳动模范代表五八人，其中共有女劳动模范代表四九人，占总数十分之一强。以民族来说，包括汉、满、蒙、回、藏、朝鲜、哈萨克、维吾尔、摩些等族，以地区来说，除西康、海南岛外，各省都有代表，还有香港护产模范代表参加。在工业代表中，各个产业部门均有相当数量的代表，国营企业占百分之八七，私营企业占百分之一三；按成份说，工人占百分之五四，管理人员占百分之一六，工程技术人员占百分之二六，工会工作者占百分之四。在农业代表中，农业（包括畜牧）占百分之五三，林业占百分之二八，水利占百分之一九；农民占百分之八十，技术人员占百分之一九，其他占百分之一。
    会议在九月二十五日开幕，十月二日闭幕，会后活动五天。代表七日离京，回返各地，先后历时两周。会议期间，参加了国庆典礼观礼，见了毛主席，听了中央负责同志的讲话，出席了毛主席、苏联罗申大使及其他机关的招待宴会、座谈会。分头参观了工厂、农场，游览了故宫、颐和园，参加了七次晚会。
    会议上有五十四个代表讲了话，介绍劳模事迹和工作经验，并有东北和天津市总工会代表报告了组织生产竞赛与新纪录运动的经验。最后作了会议总结，并通过了向毛主席致敬信，为表现会议精神的最重要的文件。在闭幕会议上又与战斗英雄代表会议联名发表了《告全国军队与劳动人民书》、《声援朝鲜反美侵略》及《慰问死难烈士家属与荣誉军人》的电报。在会议中印发了劳动模范典型材料一一九份，事迹摘要三九五份，编写典型人物小册子三十五种，包括工农业模范代表一○四人。现正编辑大会纪念刊。与会议同时举办的工农兵劳模成绩展览会，截至十月底止，平均每日有观众万余人。
    （二）事实证明这次会议的召开是适合时宜的。政务院决定颁布之后，全国各地即热烈响应。许多工厂的工人，以生产竞赛的实际行动回答了这一号召。会议期间，北京各工厂机关学校纷纷要求劳动模范代表讲话，共组织讲演会二○次，听众约有七万余人。参加大会采访的新闻机关、杂志社及各文艺团体的记者、作家共一百九十五人，先后经由通讯社、报社、电台发布的新闻、特写、通讯、访问记等，据不完全统计有五百二十八篇。像人数这样多，包括面这样广的新闻活动，在首都还是第一次。表现了各方面对于会议的重视，也反映了群众的热烈情绪。大会情况的广播，受到各地群众的热烈欢迎。许多地区的工作干部都抽出时间来收听。有些工厂工人群众听了毛主席在开幕时的讲话后，非常兴奋，自动提出保证完成并超过生产任务。
    （三）全体代表的情绪，自始至终，都是十分饱满，许多代表表示能到北京，在皇宫里开会、讲话、见毛主席，过去作梦都没想过。代表们切身地感到劳动光荣，劳动人民受到无比的尊敬，真正从牛马不如的生活中翻了身。因而认识到人民政府真正是自己的政府，共产党和毛主席真正是人民的救星。有许多代表兴奋得睡不着觉，尤其农民代表，很多人睡下后半夜又坐起来。平素不讲话的人，也滔滔不绝地说话了。有些代表和毛主席握了手，感动得流眼泪。这都表露了群众对领袖的真诚的爱戴。经过这次会议，代表们在思想上是提高了一步。毛主席指示的，要建设强大的国防力量与强大的经济力量，成了到会代表的一致的思想。代表们纷纷表示决心，回去一定要把生产提高一步，好使国富兵强。许多代表把劳动模范的带头、骨干、桥梁作用，反复背诵，并且研究回去如何起这几个作用。一般地都认识了：一切成绩的创造，离开群众是不成功的，都表示必须与群众结合。虽然也有少数代表，发生了骄傲情绪，留恋大城市花花世界，不愿回山沟，但是，会议基本上是达到表扬功臣，鼓励模范，指出方向，树立榜样，教育群众的目的。
    （四）会议的准备时间很仓促，但大多数地区都贯彻了政务院的指示，严肃认真地进行了这一工作；也有个别地区在评选工作上，表现了单纯任务观点，忽视在群众中的宣传教育工作。结果选出的代表，不够条件，有个别代表不是真正群众选出的而是上级指派的，有个别政治表现不好的分子也当了代表，这表现某些地方在评选工作中缺乏应有的严肃负责的精神，也说明工作不深入，缺少检查与及时总结，对群众运动中的积极分子还不够了解。
    会议的组织领导上有不少缺点，几个重要文件没有预先准备好，组织工作上表现了许多混乱现象，宣传工作没有很好地计划和组织，集体模范条件没有明确规定，使各地难于推选。同时对各地带队干部在思想上的领导与帮助不够及时，致使有的同志以代表自居，争待遇，发牢骚，没有发挥他们在代表中应有的作用，并增加了工作中的一些困难。
    （五）对会后应进行的工作及今后组织劳模运动的工作，提出几点意见供中央及各地方研究：
    （甲）各地在代表回去后，一般都进行了不少宣传工作，如组织群众欢迎会，请代表作报告等。但我们觉得还不够广泛深入。因此提议各地工会组织要在每个工厂企业都召集群众会议或代表会议，传达这次会议的精神，宣读共产党中央致会议的祝词和会议向毛主席致敬信，并把它张贴在厂内各个车间、宿舍，要每个工会小组都作一次详细的讨论，要挑选一些典型模范材料，利用群众上工下工、吃饭的时间，或俱乐部举行晚会的时候宣读一两个，有必要和可能时并组织小组讨论，这样来扩大会议的影响，提高广大群众的认识、觉悟和劳动热情。
    （乙）各地可以利用会议的影响，在各工厂企业中组织生产竞赛，并有计划地使它逐渐成为经常的运动，而不让它成为时冷时热的突击运动。在生产已经正常化，工会组织已普遍建立的城市，可根据东北和天津的经验，组织全市的生产竞赛。但这样的竞赛是一个非常严重的组织工作。要作好这样的竞赛，必须由市总工会为领导，通过工会组织，自下而上的发动。必须进行充分的准备工作，必须使每个工厂、车间，生产小组直到每个工人、职员都订立生产计划或竞赛条约。必须注意在竞赛运动中开展技术改进和合理化建议工作，而避免单纯的过分的加强劳动强度。必须注意发现生产过程中的各种缺点，改善生产组织和劳动组织。必须注意产品质量的提高，而不单纯是数量的增多。必须注意建立各种制度，特别是专责制。必须注意从竞赛中逐渐规定生产定额，推行计件工资制，制定正确的奖励制度。只有这样，才能达到生产竞赛的经常性和劳动生产率的不断提高，而不致发生在竞赛中数量增多、质量降低、机器损坏、病号增加和竞赛一过、生产大减等得不偿失的现象。
    （丙）要把评选劳模形成固定的制度。每次总结生产工作时，都必须评选劳动模范，而这种评选要依靠平日的生产成绩的可靠纪录，在生产有成绩的小组、车间、工厂，都应该选出有代表性的模范人物，然后在这个基础上产生市、省、大行政区，整个产业以及全国性的劳动模范。要注意对劳动模范的培养与教育工作，使他们不断地提高政治、文化、技术水平，继续发挥他们的模范带头作用，避免骄傲自满，加强与群众的联系，以永远保持劳动模范的光荣称号。
    （丁）全市性的工业劳模，最好每年评选两次（在五一和国庆节前各评选一次），而全国性的产业性的劳模大会每年或每两年可举行一次。全国性的劳模大会的作用，主要是表扬与鼓励，因为包括各方面的人物，不可能深入地交流经验，而真正的交流经验，推广先进生产方法，应按产业系统召开会议，所以各产业部门有必要时也可以召集本产业部门的劳模会议。
    （戊）农民的劳模会议应在农闲时间举行。在土改完成了的地区，最好以区、县为单位，每年举行一次。全省与全国性的农民劳模大会，有必要时才召集，而不必每年举行。劳模的推选主要应注意善于起带头作用，组织群众实行团结互助，提高全村生产，或在改良农具种籽、组织副业生产植树造林等方面起模范作用的积极分子；由于个人勤劳耕作，提高产量有显著成绩的分子，亦可推选。在治水浚河方面可依照工厂中的办法组织竞赛，推选劳模，每次工程完结时均可举行劳模大会，给以物质和荣誉的奖励。有必要时，亦可召开某一地区或几个地区联合的劳模会议，以便交流经验，鼓励劳动热情。
    此外，提议以后各地在生产中有功的人物只给以劳动模范的称号，而不称为劳动英雄。到了条件成熟时，由中央发布授与劳动英雄称号的办法，作为全国劳动模范人物的最高称号。
