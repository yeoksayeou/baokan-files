Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, December 3rd: Business communities in Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hengyang and other cities have successively held meetings to discuss the tasks and responsibilities of the business community in the movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country.

    The Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce held an enlarged meeting from November 25th to 28th, attended by more than 400 representatives from various industries and guests. During the discussions at the meeting, representatives from various industries presented accusations about the suffering they had experienced from U.S. imperialist economic aggression in the past. For example, of the city's original 300+ manual hosiery factories, many closed down before liberation due to the dumping of American nylon stockings, leaving only 70. Now, the number has recovered to over 200. Zhang Sijun, a representative of the Wuchang garment industry, accused U.S. imperialism of the brutal methods it used to destroy China's machine industry and small handicrafts. He said: During the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States took advantage of the crisis and used low-price dumping to squeeze out Chinese factories manufacturing sewing machines, then sold them at high prices. After liberation, Chinese manufacturers were no longer suppressed by them. Now, domestically produced sewing machines are cheaper and more durable than American goods. Representatives of various industries at the meeting accused the United States of massively dumping daily necessities such as cigarettes, matches, milk, oranges, peanuts, chewing gum, glass belts, combs, and even toilet paper after Japan's surrender. This all-encompassing commodity dumping squeezed out countless large and small industrial and commercial enterprises in China. After the accusations made at the meeting, the representatives clearly recognized that U.S. imperialism was the executioner that destroyed China's national industry and commerce and plunged the Chinese people into poverty and death, and that resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country was the most effective action to protect the interests of our national industry and commerce. All the representatives unanimously stated that they would stand at their respective work posts and exert their fighting strength. The meeting finally adopted a resolution on the current situation and the tasks of the business community. It decided: (1) To strengthen unity, improve production, and support the nationwide voluntary action of resisting U.S. aggression, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country. (2) To strengthen learning, enhance understanding, strengthen our position, distinguish between enemies and friends, and intensify propaganda among the masses. (3) To not listen to American deceptive propaganda and thoroughly expose bandits and special agents, eradicate rumors, so as to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. (4) To resolutely support land reform. (5) To ensure price stability and consolidate economic order. (6) Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, to divide labor and cooperate to improve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad. (7) To rely on the working class, step up production, and promote economic prosperity. (8) To support tax policies and fulfill tax obligations. (9) To improve business methods and strengthen enterprise management. (10) To strengthen the organization and unity of industry and commerce, and strive for the construction of a new democratic economy.

    More than 600 representatives from the Guangzhou industrial and commercial community held a mobilization meeting to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country on November 20th. The meeting adopted the "Five Major Pacts and Guarantees of the Industrial and Commercial Community to Resist U.S. Aggression, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Country." The representatives attending the meeting signed the guarantee, expressing their determination to fulfill it.

    The Hengyang business community held a movement meeting to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country on November 21st. The representatives attending the meeting spoke one after another, expressing their determination to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. The meeting finally adopted the Hengyang Business Community's Declaration to Resist U.S. Aggression, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Country, and formulated eight patriotic covenants.
