    My Impressions of the "American Way of Life"
    Fang Lingru
    I lived in the United States for six years. From the American West to the American East, I lived in four cities: Seattle, Ithaca, Chicago, and Madison. I traveled to New York, Boston, and other cities and villages. I also entered two or three of their universities and came into contact with intellectuals and workers, both male and female. The time cannot be considered short, and the life cannot be considered not in-depth. However, when I left the United States, standing on the edge of the ship, watching the ship slowly leave the American coast, and the lush forests gradually disappearing into the misty air, I said to myself, I never want to come to America again.
    Why do I have so little affection for the United States? There are reasons for it. The American life I have seen in the past six years is vulgarity, prejudice, coldness, numbness, soap bubbles—fragile and broken with a slightly stronger wind—an emptiness, colorful, and false. A student who wants to pursue true democracy and freedom and see a better life is bound to be greatly disappointed and disgusted when they arrive in a country where everything is hypocritical, everything is for money, and everything is for profit.
    Let me recount a few things to confirm my feelings.
    Five or six of us students landed in Seattle. Upon arrival, old classmates came to pick us up. The first thing that surprised me was hearing them say that there was a great deal of racial discrimination in that place. English-speaking people are the most superior, Latin and Slavic people are second-class, Jews and Asians are considered third-class or lower, and at the bottom are black people.
    The first difficulty for Chinese students arriving in the United States is finding a place to live. We were like a group of wanderers, looking for rooms to rent everywhere, but what we encountered was either the door slammed in our faces with a "bang," or a cold, polite "no rooms available." We clearly saw "vacancy" signs in the windows, but those signs seemed to be sneering at us.
    We settled down in some homes because their poverty showed their racial tolerance. Chinese students were considered to have found a "home."
    Then came the philanthropists from the church, tracking us down. They wanted to wash away our sins, save our souls, surround us, treat us like lost lambs, and convert us to God.
    For three years in Seattle, we were constantly interfered with by the church. When people met us, the first question they asked was whether we were Christians and which church we attended. When we said, "We are not Christians and do not go to church," they would avoid us as if they had encountered demons. They talked about us in church. Once, they asked a professor's wife to pray for us, weeping bitterly and repenting for us. What sins did we commit? We did not bring opium, nor did we rampage and dominate their territory, occupy scenic spots in every city or village, ride on their heads, and proclaim ourselves the most superior people. We didn't peel their tree bark like American merchants in Sichuan who colluded with hooligans to tear off the bark of entire paulownia orchards in the middle of the night, causing large areas of paulownia forests to die; we did not do such vicious things. We didn't hit people and we respected their women very much. We did not have those intentions to help their enemies kill them, like they helped Japan, giving Japan gasoline and iron to bomb us, kill us, and ruin us. We would certainly not invade our Taiwan, kill the Korean people, and invade our Northeast as they do now, hindering human progress and preventing people from living a peaceful and happy life. What sins have we committed to make them worry about us so much?
    The church is the most insidious weapon of American imperialism. It wants to destroy people's confidence in themselves, shatter your hopes for a good life, cultivate your sense of inferiority, and subdue your spirit, in order to achieve its ambition of enslaving mankind and dominating the world.
    We saw them call Filipino students "sons," saying that they were immature people, without the ability to be independent, so the U.S. government had to interfere in their internal affairs, and that only after so many years would the Filipino people grow from immature to strong before they could be truly independent. But this foolish deception cannot deceive the strong Filipino people. Look, the power of the Philippine people's revolution is growing stronger day by day.
    What makes me most resentful is seeing American imperialism poisoning children. Children are the hope of the future, the morning stars before dawn. They should not be stained with the sins of their fathers' generation. However, their greedy rulers fear that they will not be able to sit high on the golden stage forever, and want to use the flesh and blood of the next generation to elevate their thrones. Therefore, American children are subjected to poisonous education from an early age. On the surface, they are lively and free, but they are heavily bound and shackled in their pure souls. In church, they are taught to submit to the authority of a vague god. In school, they are taught racial pride and hatred of other races. Most of their reading material consists of detective and gangster stories. The son of one of my landlords, twelve years old, read these books and after reading them, covered his head with a black cloth, took a wooden stick, made a gangster pose, and scared people. The originally pure and innocent little mouth sang filthy songs insulting people of color. They are so pale and thin, not getting enough to eat, their father is unemployed, and running around everywhere looking for work. During Christmas, their most important holiday, they cannot even go home to reunite. The American bourgeoisie not only makes them live such a poor life, but also uses despicable methods of temptation and deception to prevent them from pursuing the causes of hunger, but instead fantasizing that they themselves, or their sons, will one day become millionaires. But this hope is only a dream! Dreams do not last long, and the American people will gradually awaken and ignite the fire of their anger.
    Once a year there is a strange holiday. On this day, children are allowed to run wild, break other people's glass, damage other people's vehicles, and climb utility poles to cut wires. As a result, every year children lose their lives on this day because of playing with fire. I call this holiday "Villain's Day," as if they are afraid that their people will forget the villainous behavior and review it once a year.
    Everyone thinks that Americans respect women, which is the highest expression of civilization. In fact, women are just decorations in society. Eight or nine out of ten female college students are trying to gain qualifications to marry rich men. Vanity is like a foam rising from sewage. Their task is to carefully groom themselves and use cunning methods to win over men. Although the buildings of the university are engraved with goddesses of wisdom, goddesses of justice, and all noble qualities are symbolized by women, these sculptures seem very lonely, no one pays attention to them, and they merely serve as decorations in the world of money.
    The purpose of male college students in pursuing education is for their future careers. When a music student is asked about his aspirations, he only hopes that he can perform everywhere in the future, sell tickets, and make a lot of money. This is all bourgeois civilization, money has clouded their minds, and degraded people to base desires. The nobility of personality, the dignity of life, and the joy of creation cannot arise from their thoughts at all.
    "To see how advanced a country is, one should look at the lives of women and workers, whether women participate in various positions to do important work, and whether workers can participate in concerts," said Ke Lan after seeing the Romanian exhibition. That's well said. Soviet women work side by side with men; the People's Republic of China has female drivers who operate huge trains; there are female combat heroes, and countless labor models have emerged in various production positions. The common jobs for American women are typists, clerks in stores, and elementary school teachers. Although there are also jobs in factories that are the same as men, they do not receive equal pay. The so-called highest institutions of learning, such as Harvard University, did not admit female students when I went there. Once a woman gets married, her status as a slave is established from then on. Economically, she relies on men, and household chores are piled on the wife. The husband gives her pocket money every month, a disguised form of wages. Women follow men obediently, never leaving them and obeying their every command.
    When I was in the United States, I wandered around looking for free air. I heard that the University of Wisconsin was a famous place for freedom and democracy in the United States, so I went there with my niece to enroll. When I went to register, the registrar, with a cold face, refused to allow me to register. The reason was that I was a married young woman, why didn't I follow my husband and be protected and monitored by men, but came to a school alone? This was a great oddity in their eyes.
    I argued with the registrar, saying: precisely because the University of Wisconsin is the most enlightened university in the United States, and I can learn many good examples, but why not allow a female student to choose for herself the goal of her studies? He said that this is the custom in the United States, a married woman cannot be her own master. At that time, I thought of another custom in the United States, an unmarried girl, her life and actions must be constantly monitored by an older woman (in fact, it is just a formality), so I said: I have a niece who came with me, I want to protect her and take care of her. The registrar had nothing to say. I registered. You say, isn't it strange that a woman in the United States must monitor others if she is not monitored by others, and she should be exploited if she does not become a person who exploits human rights?
    We had a group of friends who organized a reading group that met once a week for discussions and reports. I remember that the location of each meeting was always a bit of a hassle. I remember one time we were holding it in the gaps between many cars in a parking lot.
    We had a classmate who was Jewish, a young poet, who graduated but couldn't find a job. One morning I saw him on a street, he was huddled on the street corner as a newspaper delivery boy.
    There is a famous American poet who is a professor at the University of Wisconsin. He invited us to his home and talked very kindly about Du Fu and Li Bai. But in public, he would not speak to Chinese people. If he showed friendship with Chinese people, he would be looked down upon by his own people.
    One summer vacation, I went to New York. The ship sailed into the Hudson River, and I saw New York City, countless towering buildings surrounded by a pervasive fog. It seemed like I was seeing a mirage, like seeing a toy. Its "greatness" did not shock me. I only felt dizzy, as if I had entered a dream. New York City was full of the sound of iron and iron hammering, the elevated railway in the sky, the underground railway, the railway climbing over mountains and valleys rumbling, numbing people's nerves. Dozens of stories of skyscrapers densely packed together, competing with each other, arrogantly overlooking the crowds, swallowing the crowds. "Noble" women, with bare shoulders and arms, draped in dark fox furs, and leisurely white-collared gentlemen chatting and laughing in palace-like living rooms. Looking down, countless crowds of people, at the foot of the high-rise buildings, on the sidewalks, in the center of the street, like ants, scurrying back and forth, what are they busy with? For life, for a little bit of residual profit leaking from the hands of the capitalists.
    Capitalists control the air and sunlight of New York. Rich people can live in sunny and ventilated houses, while poor people live in damp and dark basements. Poor people come out of the dark basement early in the morning and enter the sunless subway, and enter the deafening, blood-sucking machine rooms. These machines manufacture weapons of murder for the capitalists, manufacture consumer goods that poison the colonies, and manufacture the profits of the capitalists. New York City is such a dry city that poor people cannot breathe the fragrance of grass and trees, except for specially running to the far-off Central Park to play. The rich have their own paradise, their own ballrooms, their own swimming pools, living an unlimited life of extravagance and luxury. In contrast to this life are the slums, filthy and chaotic like a large garbage dump. The children's eyes have lost their bright and lively light, and their dull spirits face all kinds of evils. Here, people are separated by cold stone walls, parents cannot take care of their children, and children cannot take care of their parents.
    One day a child told me that an old worker died in his own house, and no one knew when he died, because when someone found him and took off his boots, even his feet were pulled off. This lonely and desolate old worker who died is one of countless American workers who have worked hard and lived in poverty all their lives! They are busy from morning to night, and they don't even know what they are busy with, they don't know that they have become slaves to life, the fish and meat of the capitalists. Today, they have suffered enough. Some of them have awakened, and have a desire to pursue a better life for mankind, an expectation for a better life for mankind, and a vision for creating a better life for mankind.

    我所见的“美国生活方式”
    方令孺
    我在美国住过六年。从西美到东美，我住过四个城市：西雅图、绮色佳、芝加哥和麦迪生。游历过纽约、波士顿和其他的城市和乡村。也进过他们的两三个大学，接触过男女知识分子和工人，时间不能算短，生活不能不算深入，然而当我离开美国的时候，站在船沿，看着轮船慢慢离开美国的海岸，苍翠的森林渐渐隐没在蒙蒙的雾气里的时候，我心里说，我再也不愿来美国了。
    为什么我对美国这样没有一点感情呢？不是没有理由的。六年来我所看见的美国生活，是庸俗，是偏见，是冷酷，是麻痹，是肥皂泡，脆弱，风稍微大一点就破碎，是一场空，五光十色，是虚假。一个为了追求真正的民主自由，想见见美好人生的学生，到那样一个一切都虚伪，一切都为了金元，一切都为了利润的国家，真要大大的失望和厌恶。
    让我追述几件事，证实我的感想。
    我们有五六个同学在西雅图上岸。一到就有老同学来接。第一个给我惊奇的，是听他们说那地方对种族是非常歧视的。说英语的民族最优秀，拉丁民族和斯拉夫民族是次等，犹太人和黄种人是看作三等以下的民族，垫底的是黑人。
    中国学生到了美国，头一个困难是住处。我们像一群流浪人，在各处找出租的房间，但遇到的，不是对着我们把大门“蓬”的关上，就是冰冷的、礼貌的说没有房子出租。明明看见窗台上放着招租的牌子，但那牌子都好像是在对我们冷笑。
    我们住下来了，是有些人家，因为他们的贫困，表示了他们对种族的宽大，中国学生算得到了“家”。
    跟着就有礼拜堂的善士们，追踪而来。要洗刷我们的罪恶，拯救我们的灵魂，围绕着我们，把我们当作迷途的羔羊，皈依到上帝的面前去。
    在西雅图三年，不断受教会的干涉。人们见了我们，第一个问话，就是问我们是否教徒，进那个礼拜堂做礼拜。我们说：我们不是教徒，也不进礼拜堂，他们就像遇到了魔鬼，匆匆的避开。他们在教堂里谈论我们。有一次，请一位教授夫人来替我们祷告，痛哭流涕的替我们忏悔。我们有什么罪？我们没有带鸦片去，我们没有在他们的国土上横行霸道，占住每个城市或乡村的名胜地点，跨在他们的头上，自称最优秀的人；我们不是去剥他们的树皮，像美国商人在四川买通流氓，在半夜里，把整片桐树园里的桐树皮撕掉，使大片的桐林死掉，那种恶毒的行为，我们不做；我们没有打人，并且非常尊敬他们的妇女；我们没有那些意图，想帮助他们的敌人去杀害他们，像他们那样帮助日本，给日本汽油和铁来轰炸我们，残杀我们，糟塌我们，更不会像他们现在一样侵略我们的台湾，杀害朝鲜人民，并侵犯到我们的东北，阻碍人类的进步，不许人们过和平美好的生活。我们有什么罪，要他们那样为我们耽心？
    教会是美帝国主义最阴毒的武器，它要毁灭人民对自己的信心，破灭你对美好人生的希望，培养你自卑之感，压伏你的精神，想达到它奴役人类，独霸世界的野心。
    我们看见他们对菲律宾的学生，唤他们作儿子，说他们是幼稚的民族，没有独立的能力，非要美国政府来干涉他的内政，说等待若干，若干年后，菲律宾人民从幼稚到壮大，才能让他们真正独立。但是这愚蠢的欺骗，欺骗不了菲律宾坚强的人民，看，菲律宾人民革命的威力，一天天壮大起来了。
    最使我愤恨的是看见美帝毒害儿童。儿童是将来的希望，是天亮以前的启明星，他不应沾染他父亲一代的罪恶，然而，他们贪婪的统治者，就怕不能永远高高的坐在黄金台上，还要把下一代的血肉垫高自己的宝座。所以美国儿童从小就受毒化的教育，表面上是活泼自由，但重重束缚，桎梏着他们纯洁的灵魂。教堂里教他们驯服于渺茫的神的权威之下，在学校里教他们种族的自傲和仇视异族，大部分读物是侦探和强盗的故事。我有一个房东的儿子，十二岁，就看这些书，看过后把黑布包起头，拿着木棒，做出强盗的姿式，乱吓人。本来是纯洁天真的小嘴，唱出污秽的侮辱有色人种的歌声。他们是那样苍白消瘦，吃不饱，父亲失业，为了寻找职业，到处跑。圣诞节，他们最重视的节日，都不能回家团聚。美国的资产阶级，不但使他们过着这样贫穷的生活，而且还用卑鄙的诱惑和欺骗的方法，使他们不追求饥饿的原因，反幻想着他们自己，或他们的儿子会一朝变成百万富翁。但是这个希望只是梦！梦是不会做长久的，美国人民会渐渐觉醒起来，燃起他们愤怒的火。
    一年一度有一个奇怪的节日，这天让孩子们尽量肆狂，打破人家的玻璃，毁坏人家的玻璃，毁坏人家的车辆，爬到电线杆上去剪电线，因此每年都有孩子在这一天为了玩火而丧失生命。这个节日，我叫它“逞凶节”，好像惟恐他们的人忘记了凶恶的行为，一年一度，温习一番。
    人人都以为美国人尊敬妇女，是最高文明的表现。事实呢，妇女只是社会上的点缀。大学女生十之八九是为了争取资格好嫁有钱的人。虚荣心像污水高涨的泡沫，对自己的任务是精心修饰，用狡猾的手腕笼络男人。虽然在大学的建筑物上，雕刻着智慧的女神，公平的女神，一切崇高的品质都以女性为象征，但是这些雕刻，显得非常寂寞，没有人理它，徒然做了金元世界的装饰品。
    大学的男生，求学的目的是为将来的职业。学音乐的学生，问他的志愿，只希望将来可以到各处表演，卖座，赚很多的钱。这都是资产阶级的文明，金元冲昏了头脑，把人堕落到卑下的欲望。人格的崇高，庄严的生活，创造的快乐，根本不能从他们思想里产生。
    “看一个国家进步的程度有多高，就看妇女和工人的生活怎么样，妇女是否参加各种岗位上做重要的工作，工人能否参加音乐会。”柯蓝在看完罗马尼亚展览会之后这样说。说得真好。苏联的妇女和男子并肩工作；中华人民共和国有女司机，开动庞大的火车；有女战斗英雄，在各种生产岗位上，出现了无数劳动模范。美国妇女普遍的工作是打字员，是店铺里的店员，是小学教师，在工厂里虽也有和男子一样的工作，但得不到同等报酬。号称最高学府如哈佛大学，在我去的那时候，不收女生。女人结了婚，奴隶的身份就从此奠定了。经济是倚靠男人，家庭劳作是堆在妻子的身上，每月由丈夫给她零用钱，变相的工资，妇女服服贴贴的跟着男人，寸步不离，惟命是从。
    我在美国的时候，曾彷徨的寻找自由空气。听说威士康辛大学是美国著名的自由民主之地，我就和我的外甥女到那里去入学。当我去注册的时候，教务长，一张冰冷的脸，不许我注册。原因，我是一个结了婚的年青的女人，为什么不跟着丈夫，受男人的保护和监视，而自己单独的来进一个学校？这在他们看是个大奇事。
    我和这位教务长争辩，我说：正因为威大是全美最开明的学府，可以学得许多好榜样，但为什么不许一个女生为自己求学的目标而选择？他说这是美国的风俗，已婚的女人，就不能做自己的主人。当时我想起美国另一种风俗，一个未婚的少女，她的生活与行动，要受一个年长的女人经常去监视（其实只是形式的），我就说：我有一个外甥女和我一道来的，我要保护她，照料她。教务长没有话说。我注了册。你说，一个女人在美国不受人监视，就要监视别人，不做一个剥削人权的人，就该被剥削，这不是奇怪的事吗？
    我们有一班朋友，组织了一个读书会，一星期聚会一次，讨论和报告。记得每次聚会的地点，总有些麻烦。记得有一次我们是在停车场许多汽车夹缝中开的。
    我们有一个同学，是犹太人，是个年青的诗人，毕业了，但找不到工作。有一天早上在一条街上看见他，他瑟缩在街头做卖报童子。
    美国有个著名的诗人，在威大做教授，他曾请我们到他家里去，很亲切的谈杜甫、李白。但是他在众人中间，就不同中国人讲话，如果他和中国人表示友谊，就要被他自己人轻视。
    有一个暑假，我到纽约去，轮船开进哈德生河，看见纽约城，无数矗立的高楼，包围在弥漫的烟雾里，我好像看见海市蜃楼，好像是看见玩具，它的“伟大”，没有惊倒我。我只觉得昏昏沉沉像走入了梦境。纽约城充满了铁与铁轰砸的声音，天上铁道，地下铁道，爬山过谷的铁道轰轰隆隆的，麻痹人的神经。几十层高的摩天楼密密排排挤着，互相争雄的傲视着人群吞食着人群。“高贵”的妇女们，露着肩臂，披着玄狐，悠闲的白硬领的绅士们在宫殿似的客厅里谈笑着。低头一看，无数的人群，在高楼的脚下，人行道上，街心，像蚂蚁一样，熙来攘往，匆匆忙忙，忙些什么？为了生活，为了从资本家手缝里漏出来的一点残余的利润。
    资本家控制着纽约的空气和阳光。有钱的人可以住向阳通风的房屋，穷人住潮湿阴暗的地下室。穷人一清早从阴暗的地下室走出来，又走进不见阳光的地下铁道，走进震耳欲聋的吸血的机器间，这些机器替资本家制造杀人的武器，制造毒害殖民地的消费品，制造资本家的利润。纽约城是这样一个干枯的城市，穷苦的人们除了特为的跑到远远的中央公园去游玩以外，呼吸不到草木的清香。富人们有自己的乐园，有自己的球场，自己的游泳池，无限制的过着穷奢极侈的生活。和这生活对照的是贫民窟，污秽，混乱像一个大垃圾堆，孩子们眼睛里丧失了明亮活跃的光芒，呆滞的精神，面临着一切的罪恶。在这里，人与人之间隔着冰冷的石墙，父母顾不到儿女，儿女顾不到父母。
    有一天一个孩子告诉我，说有一个老工人死在自己的屋里，不知道是什么时候死的，因为有人发现了，脱下他的靴子的时候，连脚都拉下来了。这个孤独凄凉死去的老工人，是无数辛苦、穷困一生的美国工人中的一个！他们一天忙到晚，自己都不知道忙的是什么，不知道自己是做了生活的奴隶，做了资本家的鱼肉。今天，他们已受尽了罪，他们有些已经觉悟起来了，有追求人类美好的生活欲望，对人类美好生活的期待，有创造人类美好生活的远景了。
