Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 27th: The Romanian News Agency reports that the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party has sent a telegram to the 15th National Convention of the Communist Party of the United States, which reads as follows: The Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party extends brotherly greetings to the 15th National Convention of the Communist Party of the United States. The discussions at your convention have received the attention of the working people of our country and the world, because these discussions involve the central issue of concern to the people of the world today—the issue of defending peace. The working people of our country are watching with warm sympathy the Communist Party of the United States' spirited struggle to win the vital interests of the American people, to fight for democracy and progress, to oppose the aggression of the U.S. and British imperialists in Korea and China, and to oppose a new world war. The Romanian people, who have suffered from imperialist oppression and the horrors of war, but have been liberated by the great Soviet Union, are now enthusiastically advancing along the road of building socialism. They believe that in doing so, they are making the most valuable contribution to the victory of the powerful peace front headed by the Soviet Union and its brilliant leader, the standard-bearer of peace, Stalin. We wish the 15th National Convention of the Communist Party of the United States complete success in its work.

    【新华社讯】罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十七日电：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会顷电美国共产党第十五次全国会议致贺，电文如下：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会谨向美国共产党第十五次全国会议致兄弟的敬礼。你们会议上的讨论受到了我国以及全世界劳动人民的注意，因为这些讨论涉及今天全世界人民所忧心的中心问题——保卫和平的问题。我国劳动人民都怀着热烈的同情注视美国共产党为争取美国人民的切身利益、争取民主和进步、反对美英帝国主义者侵略朝鲜和中国、反对新的世界大战而进行的充满反抗精神的斗争。罗马尼亚人民曾饱受帝国主义压迫和战争恐怖，但伟大的苏联解放了他们，他们已经满怀热情地沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。他们相信：他们这样作，便对以苏联及其光辉领袖，和平的旗手斯大林为首的强大的和平阵线的胜利作了最宝贵的贡献。我们谨祝美国共产党第十五次全国会议工作完满成功。
