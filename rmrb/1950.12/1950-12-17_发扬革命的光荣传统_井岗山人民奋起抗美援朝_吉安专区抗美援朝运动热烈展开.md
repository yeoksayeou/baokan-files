    Carrying Forward the Glorious Revolutionary Tradition
    Jinggangshan People Rise Up to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
    The Anti-US Aggression and Aid Korea Movement Unfolds Enthusiastically in the Ji'an Special District
    [By Our Newspaper] The movement to resist US aggression, aid Korea, protect homes, and defend the country has unfolded in the Ji'an Special District of Jiangxi Province (including eleven counties: Ji'an, Yongxin, Lianhua, Jishui, Anfu, Taihe, Wan'an, Ninggang, Yongfeng, Xiajiang, and Suichuan); it is especially heated in the Jinggangshan area (Xiagang, Ciping, and Dajing three townships, now designated as Jinggangshan District), the cradle of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army. Since the Red Army went north, the local people have suffered ruthless trampling and cruel slaughter under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries for twenty years. According to preliminary investigations, the names of 196 local people who were massacred by the reactionaries can be verified; 267 houses were burned down; and 994 mu of farmland were left barren. They hated the cruelty and violence of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Recently, the news that US imperialism openly invaded Taiwan and Korea reached the ears of the people in the mountainous areas, arousing the anger and hatred of all the people, and they enthusiastically launched the movement to resist US aggression, aid Korea, protect homes, and defend the country. Although the area is mountainous with a small population and inconvenient transportation, they completed the task of 70,000 jin of public grain in only seven days. In addition, on November 26, a mass meeting was held in Ciping Village (where Chairman Mao lived during the Jinggangshan period), with more than 2,000 people attending. At the meeting, they unanimously voiced the righteous call to resist US aggression and aid Korea and passed a declaration. Liu Xinlin, the township head of Dajing Township, who is over sixty years old and participated in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, said: "Jinggangshan has never been so peaceful in the past fifty years, allowing us to produce with peace of mind; now US imperialism wants to invade us again and prevent us from living a peaceful life, we should contribute all our strength to resist US aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country."
    On November 19, the day of Chairman Mao's birthday, more than 3,000 people in the Shangcheng District of Anfu gathered to celebrate and reviewed the people's armed forces in the district. All the militiamen firmly stated at the meeting that they would assist the public security forces in eliminating the remaining bandits and special agents, ensure the smooth progress of land reform, defend their liberation, defend their hometowns, and defend the motherland. At the people's representative conference in Yongxin County, all the representatives expressed their firm determination to resist US aggression, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country. Kuang Fanli, a female labor model from the county who attended the National Labor Model Conference, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting on her work situation and determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea after returning from the conference. In her letter, she wrote: "I guarantee to actively lead the masses to do a good job in land reform, step up production, protect local security, and resist US aggression and aid Korea with practical actions." The people of Ninggang County unanimously responded to the call to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and young people throughout the county volunteered to join the army. When Xie Wende, a peasant representative, sent his only son to join the army, he said: "In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, we suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation; now Chairman Mao has led us to stand up and establish our own country, and the United States wants to invade again, we must contribute all our strength to defend our motherland." Zhang Jiping, a special-class model worker, said: "My son is in the local armed county brigade. If the brigade headquarters allows it, I will tell him to go to Korea to fight the American devils!"

    发扬革命的光荣传统  
    井岗山人民奋起抗美援朝            
    吉安专区抗美援朝运动热烈展开
    【本报讯】江西吉安专区（包括吉安、永新、莲花、吉水、安福、泰和、万安、宁冈、永丰、峡江、遂川等十一县）抗美援朝保家卫国运动已经展开；特别是人民解放军前身工农红军策源地井岗山区（下庄、茨坪、大井三个乡，现已划为井岗山区）更为热烈。该地人民自从红军北上后，二十年来在国民党反动派长期统治下，当地人民遭到无情的蹂躏和残酷的屠杀。据初步调查，当地人民被反动派屠杀有名姓可考的达一百九十六名；被烧毁房屋二百六十七栋；荒芜田地九百九十四亩。他们痛恨着国民党反动派的残忍凶暴。最近美帝公然侵略台湾与朝鲜的消息，传到山区人们的耳中，激起了全体人民的愤怒和痛恨，他们热烈地掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国运动。该地虽然山多人少，交通不便，但他们仅七天时间，就全部完成了七万斤的公粮任务。另外又于十一月二十六日在茨坪村（毛主席在井岗山时期住过的地方）召开了群众大会，到会人数达二千余人，在会上都异口同声地发出抗美援朝的正义呼声，并通过了宣言。大井乡乡长柳辛林，今年六十多岁了，曾参加过工农红军，他说：“井岗山五十年来从来没有现在这样太平，使我们都安心生产；现在美帝又想侵略我们，不让过太平日子，我们应当拿出自己的一切力量来抗美援朝保家卫国。”
    安福上城区人民，在十一月十九日毛主席诞辰那天，全区三千多人集会庆祝，并检阅全区人民武装力量。全体民兵在大会上坚决表示：协助公安部队肃清残余土匪特务，保证土地改革工作顺利进行，保卫翻身，保卫家乡，保卫祖国。永新县在各界人民代表会上，全体代表都表示坚决抗美援朝保家卫国。该县出席全国劳模大会的女劳动模范旷凡里，曾写信给毛主席报告开会回来之后的工作情况及抗美援朝的决心。她在信中写道：“我保证积极领导群众做好土改工作，加紧生产，保卫地方治安，以实际行动抗美援朝。”宁冈县人民一致响应抗美援朝的号召，全县青年纷纷自愿报名参军。农民代表谢文德送他的独生子参军时说：“过去在国民党反动派统治时期，我们受尽了一切压迫与剥削；现在毛主席领导我们翻了身，成立了自己的国家，美国又想来侵略，我们要拿出一切力量保卫祖国。”特等工作模范张积平说：“我的儿子在地方武装县大队，若是大队部允许的话，我叫他到朝鲜去打美国鬼子！”
