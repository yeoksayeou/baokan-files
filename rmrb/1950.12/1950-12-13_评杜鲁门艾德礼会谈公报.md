Editorial

    The Chinese People's Volunteers' aid to Korea and the victory of the Chinese and Korean people's armies fighting side by side against the American aggressor troops have not only fundamentally changed the situation in Korea but are also causing significant changes in the world situation. The imperialist camp's all-out, largest, and most insane act of aggression in the five years since the end of World War II has suffered a decisive defeat. The truth that the strength of the peace and democracy camp is greater than that of the imperialist camp has been concretely proven. This fact cannot but encourage the world's people to fight for peace and repel aggression, and it cannot but expand the various contradictions within the imperialist camp.

    The Truman-Attlee talks were held precisely in this dark atmosphere that shrouds the imperialist world. The two chieftains of world imperialism held six talks in a row but did not give their followers any bright hope. American, Western European, and Eastern pro-imperialist public opinion expressed widespread indifference, disappointment, and unease regarding the Truman-Attlee talks communiqué. Many newspapers in imperialist countries have noted that the United States and Britain have for the first time formally announced that they have an unavoidable state and division of opinion on major issues in the East, which is certainly not something the imperialist bloc will applaud. The seemingly strong but essentially weak paper tiger nature of imperialism is now more clearly exposed before all of humanity than ever before!

    However, it must be pointed out that the imperialists have not learned the lessons they should have from the Korean debacle. The Truman-Attlee talks communiqué shows that although their original plan of aggression has failed and they are facing insurmountable difficulties, they still want to accelerate preparations for a new war, continue to invade Korea and occupy our country's Taiwan Province, continue to prevent our country from participating in the meetings and work of the United Nations, and continue to strengthen the encirclement of our country. This tells the people of China and the world that the struggle to defeat imperialist aggression must not be relaxed in the slightest because of the victories already won. We must redouble our efforts and continue to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialists in order to completely shatter any of their plans for aggression.

    To continue to expand their aggression, what are the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices trying to do?

    First, they have decided to actively strengthen their aggressive military forces. The communiqué states: "The necessity of strengthening the forces of collective security (should be read as aggressive forces) has been recognized, and actions are now underway to achieve this goal. In considering the various necessities of the Far Eastern situation, we have always kept in mind the urgency of building the strength of the entire free world. We fully agree that all North Atlantic Treaty countries must take immediate action to step up their efforts to build their own defenses (should be read as aggressive forces) and strengthen the Atlantic community. We recognize that an adequate defense force (should be read as aggressive force) is necessary if war is to be prevented (should be read as continued expansion)." To this end, they decided: "1. The military strength of the United States and the United Kingdom should be increased as quickly as possible. 2. The two countries should expand the production of military supplies that can be used by the armed forces of all free countries participating in joint defense. The United States and the United Kingdom should, together with other free countries, continue to formulate mutual agreements under which all countries will make appropriate contributions to the common defense." In addition, they "jointly agreed that a supreme commander" of the "unified forces" "should be appointed as soon as possible."

    This means that the U.S. imperialists and their accomplice, British imperialists, are determined to accelerate the organization of aggressive military forces. Not only that, but the U.S. imperialists also want to force other countries in the "free world," especially the "Atlantic community," to accelerate the expansion of aggressive military forces. And such aggressive forces are under the unified command of the U.S. imperialists, that is, unified under the command of America's Eisenhower. This shows that the U.S. imperialists, with the help of their accomplices, are determined to force other countries onto the chariot of aggression. These countries will not only provide cannon fodder but also military supplies.

    Under the policy of actively preparing for war, the British Labour government had already announced on August 4 that it would increase military spending to 3.4 billion pounds over the next three years, and Attlee further declared on September 12 that it would increase military spending even further to 3.6 billion pounds, which is an average of 1.2 billion pounds per year, 420 million pounds more than the original budget of 780 million pounds for this year, accounting for about one-third of national expenditure – compared to 22.6 percent before the Korean War. In a statement on August 5, the French government stated that this year's military expenditure was 500 billion francs, and in 1951 it would increase to 580 billion, and in the three years thereafter, supplementary military expenditure would be as high as 2,000 billion francs, that is, 1,250 billion francs per year, about one-fifth of the total national income. Other Marshallized countries have also announced increases in military spending, such as Sweden (1951-52) to 1.0885 billion kronor, the Danish Parliament has passed an increase in military spending of 350 million kronor, and the Norwegian government has obtained parliamentary approval for a military plan costing 250 million kronor. As for the U.S. government itself, it has twice requested additional military appropriations since the Korean War, increasing direct military expenditure for this year to $41.8 billion, almost 20 percent of national income, whereas in 1939, U.S. military expenditure accounted for only 1.6 percent of national income. It is foreseeable that the governments of these countries will further expand military spending, extend the term of military service, and accelerate conscription in order to step up war preparations.

    Secondly, Truman and Attlee stated that their aggressor troops would disregard the just calls of the people of the world to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and would continue to remain in Korea. The communiqué stated: "'United Nations forces' were sent to Korea under the authority of the United Nations and at the suggestion of the United Nations. The 'United Nations' has not changed its mandate to them, and the troops of our two countries will continue to fulfill their responsibilities." Therefore, the Chinese and Korean people's armies must continue to work tirelessly to give the enemy heavy blows in order to make the enemy withdraw their bloody hands of aggression and put away their aggressive spears.

    The Truman-Attlee talks communiqué nakedly announced, in a completely piratical tone, that the imperialists insisted on seizing our country's Taiwan Province by force. They blatantly and shamelessly abandoned the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, seized our country's territory of Taiwan as their own, and then presented it as a "problem," implying that they would detach Taiwan from our country. They said: "We agree that this issue (the so-called 'Formosa issue') should be resolved peacefully and in a way that safeguards the interests of the people of Formosa and maintains the peace and security of the Pacific. And believe that a discussion of this issue by the United Nations will help achieve these goals." When the British imperialists voted against the three proposals of our special envoy Wu Xiuquan at this Security Council meeting, they had actually endorsed the U.S. imperialist's armed aggression against Taiwan; this communiqué further proves that in the Taiwan issue, the British imperialists are following the U.S. imperialists. We must once again solemnly warn the U.S. and British imperialists: Your attempt to evade the crime of the United States seizing our country's territory of Taiwan by fabricating a so-called "Formosa issue" and saying how it should be "resolved" will absolutely not change the sacred determination of our people to recover Taiwan in the slightest, nor will it change the anger of the people of the world towards your daylight robbery of piracy in the slightest, but only proves that you are indeed a bunch of bandits and indeed the mortal enemies who should be universally hated by the Chinese people. Only the U.S. imperialists' most rude and shameless act of aggression, which disregards international law, is undermining the interests of the Taiwan compatriots and the interests of peace and security in the Pacific. The U.S. government must be responsible for all the consequences of its aggression against our country's Taiwan, and the British government must also be responsible for the consequences of its following the U.S. aggression and therefore agreeing to discuss the so-called "Formosa issue" in the United Nations.

    The Truman-Attlee talks communiqué also announced that the U.S. government continues to oppose our country's attendance at the United Nations. The communiqué stated: "The United States has opposed in the past and continues to oppose the granting of a seat in the United Nations to the representatives of China." Here, the U.S. government has once again proven its hostility towards the Chinese people. It can be seen that the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China have been consistently barred from the United Nations for more than a year precisely because of the obstruction and sabotage of the U.S. government, and precisely because the U.S. government is attempting to permanently transform the United Nations into a tool of aggression. Facts show that the United States is using the United Nations to launch political slanders against our country and will use the United Nations to carry out an economic blockade against our country after the U.S. aggressor troops suffer further defeats. The eyes of the people of the world are discerning, and they will never believe the deceptive propaganda of the imperialists, and the new China, with the people in power, has the confidence and ability to break any economic blockade. It is the countries coerced by U.S. imperialism into carrying out the blockade that will suffer the damage.

    The U.S. imperialists and their accomplices not only want to continue to occupy our country's Taiwan and continue to prevent our country's representatives from attending the United Nations, but also continue to strengthen the encirclement against our country. The communiqué stated: "Communist aggression in Korea has increased the threat to the security and independence of Asian countries. We reaffirm our intention to continue to help them." As is well known, the U.S. imperialists have strengthened their aggressive activities around our country, trying to turn the countries bordering us into bases for aggression against China. Following Truman's announcement on June 27 to strengthen aggression against Vietnam and the Philippines, the United States has separately concluded military and economic agreements with Thailand and Burma, on the one hand strengthening economic plunder of these countries and on the other hand strengthening its activities to turn these countries into military aggression bases. The U.S. military mission, headed by Blinken, has long arrived in Saigon, and the U.S. government has also dispatched additional naval vessels and bombers to assist the French aggressor troops and the Bao Dai government in attacking the Vietnamese people. The military aircraft of the French aggressors in Vietnam have repeatedly invaded our Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, bombing and strafing our peaceful residents, and carrying out armed provocations against our country. U.S. military assistance to Thailand is also actively underway. At the same time, British military cooperation with the United States in Southeast Asia is intensifying day by day, and the British government's oppression of overseas Chinese in Malaya and Chinese residents in Hong Kong is becoming increasingly fierce. Obviously, the fundamental purpose of these activities of the U.S. and British imperialists is to threaten our country's security. This is part of the overall imperialist plan of aggression, and our people must heighten their vigilance and resolutely oppose it.

    With the U.S. aggressor troops suffering serious defeats in Korea, the Chinese and Korean people's armies are pursuing the enemy, and with the people of the world unanimously demanding that the United States stop its aggression against Korea and withdraw its troops from Korea, Truman and Attlee had to hypocritically declare in the communiqué: "For our part, we are willing to seek an end to hostilities through negotiations." However, judging from the entire content of the communiqué and the actual actions of the U.S. and British imperialists, the imperialists have absolutely no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue. The Chinese people have always advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the imperialists have repeatedly rejected the peaceful settlement proposals put forward by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Representative Wu Xiuquan at the Security Council. Today, we still support a peaceful resolution and support a truly democratic peaceful resolution. That is to withdraw the U.S. and other countries' aggressor troops from Korean territory; withdraw the U.S. aggressor troops occupying our country's Taiwan; abolish the encirclement of our country and stop all activities of expanding armaments and preparing for war. Only in this way can it be a solution that conforms to the will and demands of the people of China, Asia, and the world; only in this way can the peace and security of the Pacific and the world be guaranteed. However, the imperialists oppose such a peaceful resolution, which is the only reason why the Korean War has not yet ended.

    In any case, the Truman-Attlee talks communiqué is full of irreconcilable contradictions. On the one hand, it has suffered a decisive and irreparable defeat, while on the other hand, it continues to adhere to the plan of aggression. This is the fundamental contradiction and fundamental weakness of U.S. and British imperialist policy. The imperialists have announced their plan of aggression, which will certainly arouse the vigilance of the people of the world, but this can only strengthen the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world. The people of the world are full of confidence in the future of this struggle. Since the imperialists cannot draw the necessary lessons from their existing failures, then as long as they do not abandon their plans for aggression, no matter how fierce they appear in their dreams, they will only suffer greater failures.

    评杜鲁门艾德礼会谈公报
    中国人民志愿军的援助朝鲜，以及中朝人民军队比肩反抗美国侵略军的胜利，不但使朝鲜战局发生了根本的变化，而且也正在使世界的形势发生重大的变化。帝国主义阵营竭尽全力所进行的在第二次世界大战结束以来五年中最大规模的和最疯狂的一次侵略行动，已经遭到了决定性的失败。和平民主阵营的力量大于帝国主义阵营的真理，已经得到了具体的证明。这个事实，不能不鼓舞全世界人民争取和平击退侵略的斗争，不能不扩大帝国主义阵营内部的各种矛盾。
    杜鲁门艾德礼的会谈正是在笼罩着帝国主义世界的这个阴暗空气中举行的。世界帝国主义的这两个魁首一连会谈了六次，却并没有向他们的追随者给予什么光明的希望。美国的、西欧的和东方的亲帝国主义舆论对于杜鲁门艾德礼会谈的公报表示广泛的冷淡、失望和不安。帝国主义各国的很多报纸都注意到美国和英国第一次正式宣布他们在东方的主要问题上存在着无可奈何的状态和分裂的状态，而这当然是不会叫帝国主义集团喝彩的。帝国主义的外强中干的纸老虎原形，现在是空前明显地暴露在全世界人类的眼前了！
    但是应当指出，帝国主义者还没有从朝鲜的惨败中得到应有的教训。杜鲁门艾德礼会谈的公报表明，虽然他们的原定的侵略计划已经破产，他们已经面对着不可克服的困难，他们仍然要加速进行新战争的准备，仍然要继续侵略朝鲜和侵占我国的台湾省，继续阻止我国参加联合国的会议和工作，并要继续加强对我国的包围圈。这就是告诉全中国和全世界人民，对于击破帝国主义侵略的斗争，决不能够因为已得的胜利而有丝毫放松，必须再接再厉，继续向帝国主义者作坚决的斗争，以便彻底粉碎他们的任何侵略计划。
    为了继续扩大侵略，美帝国主义者及其同谋犯企图做些什么呢？
    首先，他们决定积极加强其侵略的军事力量。公报说：“大家已经认识到加强集体安全力量（应读作侵略力量）的必要，现在为了达到这样目的的行动正在进行中。我们在考虑远东局势的各种必要性时，始终记着建立整个自由世界的力量的紧迫性。我们完全同意，一切北大西洋公约的国家必须立刻行动，加紧它们的努力，建设自己的防务（应读作侵略力量）与加强大西洋社会。我们认识到，假如要防止（应读作继续扩大）战争，充足的防御力量（应读作侵略力量）是必要的。”为此目的，他们决定：“一、美国和联合王国的军力应尽速予以增加。二、两国应扩大为所有参加共同防御的一切自由国家的军队都可以使用的军火生产。美国与联合王国应偕同其他自由国家继续制订互相的协议，根据这些协议，一切国家均将对共同防御作适当的贡献。”此外，他们还“共同认为应该从速任命”“统一军队”的最高司令官。
    这就是说，美帝国主义者及其同谋犯英帝国主义者决心加速组织侵略军事力量，不但如此，美帝国主义者还要强迫其他“自由世界”，特别是“大西洋社会”各国加速扩充侵略军事力量。而这样的侵略军，又是在美帝国主义者统一指挥下的，即统一于美国的艾森豪威尔麾下。这就说明，美帝国主义者将在其同谋犯协助之下，硬把其他各国套在侵略的兵车上。这些国家不但要供给炮灰，而且要供给军火生产品。
    在积极准备战争的方针下，英国工党政府八月四日即已宣布在今后三年把军费增至三十四亿镑，而艾德礼在九月十二日更宣称，将把军费更加提高到三十六亿镑，也就是每年平均十二亿镑，比本年度原来预算的七亿八千万镑多四亿二千万镑，即约占全国支出的三分之一——在朝鲜战争前则占百分之二十二点六。法国政府在八月五日的声明中，本年度军费为五千亿法郎，一九五一年将增至五千八百亿外，在此后三年中，补充军费将高达二万亿法郎，即每年达一万二千五百亿法郎，约为全部国民收入的五分之一。其他马歇尔化各国，也已宣布增加军费，如瑞典将增加（一九五一——五二年）至十亿零八千八百五十亿克隆纳，丹麦国会已通过增加军费三亿五千万克隆纳，挪威政府已得国会同意一个花费二亿五千万克隆纳的军事计划。至于美国政府本身，它在朝鲜战争后已两度要求增加军事补充拨款，使本年度直接军费增至四百十八亿美元，几达全国国民收入的百分之二十，而在一九三九年，美国军费占国民收入的百分比，不过一点六。可以预见，这些国家的政府，更将扩大军事开支，延长兵役期限，并加速征兵，以便加紧战争的准备。
    其次，杜鲁门和艾德礼表示他们的侵略军将不顾全世界人民的把一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的正义呼声，而继续留在朝鲜。公报称：“‘联合国军’是根据联合国的授权，并应联合国的建议而被派入朝鲜的。‘联合国’并没有变更其授予他们的使命，我们两国的军队仍将继续履行他们的责任。”因此，中朝人民军队，必须继续努力不懈地给敌人以沉重打击，才能使敌人缩回侵略的血手，收起侵略的长矛。
    杜鲁门和艾德礼会谈的公报，赤裸裸地用完全海盗式的口吻宣布帝国主义者坚持要武装夺取我国台湾省。他们公然无耻地抛弃了开罗宣言和波茨坦宣言，把我国领土台湾掠为己有，然后把它当作一个“问题”提出，暗示将使台湾脱离我国。他们说：“我们一致认为：这个问题（所谓‘福摩萨问题’）应该用和平办法并且循着保障福摩萨人民的利益及维持太平洋和平与安全的保障，来加以解决。并认为联合国对这个问题的讨论，将有助于这些目的的实现。”英帝国主义者在这次安理会上投票反对我特派代表伍修权的三项建议的时候，已实际赞成美帝武装侵略台湾的行动；这个公报，更证明了在台湾问题上英帝是追随美帝的。我们必须再一次正告美英帝国主义者：你们企图逃避美国夺取我国领土台湾的罪责，而捏造出一个什么“福摩萨问题”，说它应该如何如何“解决”，这绝对不会丝毫改变我国人民收复台湾的神圣决心，也绝对不会丝毫改变全世界人民对于你们的白昼行劫的海盗行为的愤怒，而只是证明你们确确实实是一伙盗匪，确确实实是应该受中国人民普遍仇恨的死敌。只有美帝国主义的这个目无国际法纪的最无礼和最无耻的侵略行为，才是破坏了台湾同胞的利益和太平洋和平安全的利益。美国政府必须对它的侵略我国台湾的行为的一切后果负责，而英国政府也必须对它追随美国侵略因而同意在联合国讨论所谓“福摩萨问题”的行为的后果负责。
    杜鲁门艾德礼会谈的公报又宣布美国政府继续反对我国出席联合国。该公报称：“美国过去反对，现仍继续反对中国的代表获得联合国中的席位。”在这里，美国政府又一次证明了它对于中国人民的敌视。由此可见，中华人民共和国的合法代表一年多来，始终被拒于联合国门外，正是由于美国政府操纵阻挠的结果，正是美国政府企图永远变联合国为侵略工具的结果。事实表明，美国正在利用联合国对我国发动政治诬蔑，并将在美国侵略军进一步遭受失败后，利用联合国来对我国进行经济封锁。全世界的人民眼睛是雪亮的，他们决不会相信帝国主义者的欺骗宣传，而人民掌握了政权的新中国，是有信心和能力打破任何经济封锁的。遭受损害的，将是被美帝国主义胁迫进行封锁的国家自己。
    美国帝国主义者及其同谋犯不仅要继续强占我国台湾及继续阻止我国代表出席联合国，而且，还要继续加强反对我国的包围圈。公报称：“共产党对朝鲜的侵略增加了对亚洲国家的安全与独立的威胁。我们重申我们打算继续帮助它们。”如所周知，美帝国主义者已在我国周围加强其侵略活动，力图把与我接壤各国，变为其侵略中国的基地。继杜鲁门六月二十七日宣布加强对越南及菲律宾的侵略后，美国已分别与泰国及缅甸缔结军事及经济协定，一方面加强对各该国的经济掠夺，一方面又加强其变这些国家为军事侵略基地的活动。以白林克为首的美国军事使团早已到达西贡，美国政府并已增派海军舰艇及轰炸机，协助法国侵略军及保大政府，进攻越南人民。法国侵略越南的军用飞机一再侵越我滇桂二省，轰炸扫射我国和平居民，实行向我国武装挑衅。美国对泰国的军事援助也在积极进行中。与此同时，英国在东南亚与美国的军事合作一天比一天加紧，英国政府对于马来亚华侨和香港中国居民的压迫也一天比一天凶恶。显然，美英帝国主义这些活动的根本目的，都在威胁我国的安全。这是帝国主义整个侵略计划的一部分，我国人民必须提高警惕和坚决反对。
    在美国侵略军在朝鲜遭受严重失败，中朝人民军队正在追击敌人，在全世界人民一致要求美国停止侵略朝鲜，撤退侵朝军队的情况下，杜鲁门和艾德礼不得不假惺惺地在公报中宣称：“在我们这一方面，我们是愿意以谈判的办法来寻求敌对行动的结束的。”然而，从公报的整个内容和美英帝国主义者的实际行动看来，帝国主义者是完全没有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意的。中国人民从来主张和平解决朝鲜问题。但是，帝国主义者却一再拒绝了我周恩来外长及伍修权代表在安理会提出的和平解决建议。今天，我们仍然赞成和平解决，赞成真正民主的和平解决。那就是撤退朝鲜境内的美国及其他国家的侵略军队；撤退侵占我国台湾的美国侵略军队；撤销对我国的包围圈及停止扩军备战的一切活动。只有这样，才是符合中国、亚洲及全世界人民的意志与要求的解决办法；只有这样，才能使太平洋及全世界的和平与安全获得保障。然而帝国主义者反对这样的和平解决，这就是朝鲜战争至今还不能结束的唯一原因。
    无论如何，杜鲁门艾德礼会谈的公报是充满着不可调和的矛盾。一方面已经遭受了决定性的和不可挽救的失败，而另一方面又继续坚持侵略的计划。这就是美英帝国主义政策的根本矛盾和根本弱点。帝国主义者宣布了他们的侵略计划，这当然会引起全世界人民的警惕，但是这只能加强全世界人民的反帝国主义斗争罢了，对于这一斗争的前途，全世界人民是充满了信心的。帝国主义者既然不能从已有的失败中获得必要的教训，那么，只要他们不放弃他们的侵略计划，无论他们在他们的梦想中表现得怎样凶恶，就只有遭受更大的失败。
