Since the National Cotton Production Conference in August determined that maintaining superior varieties should focus on the procurement of seed cotton, the Central Agricultural and Trade Ministries jointly issued instructions on superior variety procurement, stipulating that superior variety seed cotton in superior variety areas should, in principle, be self-collected and ginned by agricultural departments, and purchased at a 4% premium. The necessary funds were to be fully provided by the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation, and the People's Bank was to issue cotton seed loans for 1951 in advance. Governments at all levels convened procurement meetings, and most levels established seed selection committees and cotton collection and preservation committees, organizing the masses to retain seeds themselves and select and separate good seeds, selling good seed cotton to superior cotton procurement agencies. In many areas, to identify superior cotton, they carefully graded and inspected it, issuing superior cotton certificates or cotton sale certificates. In terms of procurement methods, most areas (North China and Henan, etc.) self-collected and ginned cotton through cotton production agencies, while in some areas where cotton production departments lacked capacity, the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation and cooperatives acted as agents for collection, and the agricultural departments' superior cotton ginneries acted as agents for ginning; a few areas collected cotton seeds. Due to the above series of measures, superior variety procurement has generally been smooth, and a large number of good seed cotton have been collected. Areas that did not have the habit of selling seed cotton in the past have also begun to transition to selling seed cotton. As of the beginning of November, Hebei Province had collected over 19 million jin of seed cotton (completing two-thirds of the task); statistics from the five superior variety management areas in Pingyuan showed nearly two million jin had been procured; Liaodong Province in Northeast China had already procured about six million jin by mid-October. Currently, various regions are conducting cotton seed identification in addition to collecting cotton, and nationwide, this year's cotton seed work is better than last year. However, there are still some problems in the superior variety procurement work that should be addressed in a timely manner.

    1.  The price of procuring superior variety seed cotton: This year's superior cotton varieties, in areas where germination is uniform, generally have yields 10% higher than local original varieties, and the fiber length is one grade higher or more, and in some cases, the lint percentage is also higher. Many merchants want to procure superior cotton by deception, so the quality of the price of lint and seed cotton and whether the conversion is correct all affect the procurement of superior varieties. For example, in early October, the standard lint price in Tangshan was 7,900 yuan, and the reasonable converted seed cotton price was 2,780 yuan, while the China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabrics Corporation's listed price was only 2,450 yuan, and the market price was 2,600 yuan. Another example is the Gaomi superior variety management area in Shandong, where at the end of September, the price within the area was lower than the surrounding areas, and private merchants' procurement of ordinary cotton in the surrounding areas was higher than in the superior variety management area, resulting in public dissatisfaction and a large loss of superior varieties (1 jin of standard lint in the superior management area was 7,600 yuan, while it reached 9,500 yuan in the surrounding area). Due to this situation, the 4% premium also had no effect. There are also areas that have not cooperated well with cooperatives, resulting in mutual competition for procurement. Furthermore, some ginneries directly purchase large quantities of cotton at the market, which affects the confusion of superior varieties. Although this phenomenon has now been corrected, in order to fulfill the task of mastering superior varieties for promotion next year, the correct conversion of lint and seed cotton prices, and the certain difference between superior and non-superior varieties, should still be promptly paid attention to and controlled.

    2.  The 4% premium for superior varieties: This spring, many regions developed superior cotton varieties, but failed to raise prices in advance to procure good seed cotton for ginning, but instead purchased large quantities of general cotton seeds, resulting in significant losses. To learn from this lesson, it was stipulated that a 4% premium be given for the procurement of superior cotton varieties to encourage farmers to separate good and bad cotton when harvesting, and to enthusiastically send superior variety seed cotton to superior variety procurement agencies to prevent the loss of superior varieties. The scope of the premium is limited to the superior variety management areas that procure seed cotton; however, due to the lack of deep understanding of this spirit in many areas, there have also been significant deviations: (1) Some places believe that all superior varieties, regardless of whether they are in the superior management area or the general promotion area, should be given a premium; (2) Some believe that it is unfair to only give a premium to the superior variety management area and not to the ordinary area, so either all areas should be given a premium, or none should be given a premium; (3) Some believe that the premium is simply a reward for growing superior varieties, so both seed cotton and lint should be given a premium; (4) Some areas have not properly implemented the superior cotton certificate system, and their grading technology is poor, allowing cotton merchants to exploit loopholes and transport cotton from non-superior variety areas to sell, resulting in chaotic procedures. Farmers reported that "the 4% premium for superior cotton is all going to the cotton merchants." This not only wastes the government's 4% premium fee, but also provides farmers with inferior seeds, affecting promotion next year. The above shortcomings should be well corrected by the relevant departments.

    3.  In some areas, superior variety ginneries have not been well integrated with the superior variety management areas. The work of cotton seed identification and sorting is handled by personnel sent by the superior variety management areas stationed in the factory, and the factory only manages ginning, which seriously affects the purity of the superior variety quality and loses the significance of the agricultural department building factories for ginning.

    4.  In terms of storage, due to a shortage of warehouses and negligence in storage, there are frequent occurrences of moldy seed cotton and cotton seeds. According to reports from various places: In Shaojiatun Cotton Improvement Cooperative, Yexian County, Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, about 300,000 jin of superior variety and ordinary seed cotton were piled up in open sheds or on mats in the courtyard. After the continuous rain on October 13th, almost all of it was exposed to rain and moisture. After a post-rain investigation, about 200,000 jin of seed cotton (including superior varieties) were heating up and becoming moldy, and the seed cotton deteriorated. About 8,000 jin germinated; 160,000 jin of cotton seeds in the Fenglezhen Ginnery were also rained on and heated up, making them unsuitable for seed; 200,000 jin of seed cotton in Nangong, Hebei Province, also heated up and deteriorated. Some ginneries store large quantities of seed cotton but cannot gin it in time, and are unwilling to organize private vehicles to gin it, resulting in losses.

    5.  How should various regions pay attention to solving the preparation of cotton seeds for next year? In order to complete the seeds needed for expanding cotton fields and promoting superior cotton next year, and to solve the shortage of cotton seeds in some disaster areas, the procurement and transfer of cotton seeds must be done well this winter and spring. In the procurement of superior varieties, all relevant departments should earnestly implement the instructions issued by the Central Trade and Agriculture Ministries on October 14th to ensure reasonable cotton prices, in order to control superior varieties and give play to the role of the 4% premium. Ordinary cotton seeds should also be adjusted according to the needs of various regions by governments and cooperatives at all levels, using local solutions. However, whether it is the promotion of superior varieties or the adjustment of ordinary seeds, seed identification, storage, transportation, and promotion work must be done well, and a necessary system of responsibility transfer must be established to avoid repeating the mistakes of poor cotton seeds last year.

    优良棉种收购工作中存在的几个问题
    金熙彬
    自八月全国棉产工作会议确定保持良种以收购籽棉为主后，中央农业、贸易二部，联合发布了良种收购指示，确定良种区之良种籽棉原则上由农业部门自收自轧，并加价百分之四收购。所需资金，由花纱布公司充分供给，人民银行提前贷发一九五一年棉种贷款。各级政府召开了收购会议，各级政府大都设立了选种委员会及收花保种委员会，组织群众自留种及选良分收，将好籽棉卖给良棉收购机构。不少地区为鉴别良棉，认真分级检验，颁发了良棉证或售花证。在收购方式上，大部（华北及河南等地）地区，由棉产机构自收自轧，部分地区棉产部门力量不够，由花纱布公司、合作社代收，农业部门的良棉轧花厂代理轧花；个别地区收棉籽。由于上述一系列的措施，良种收购一般的都很顺利，收到了大批好籽花。过去没有卖籽棉习惯的地区，也开始转变为卖籽棉。截至十一月初止，河北省已收籽棉一千九百余万斤（完成任务三分之二）；平原五个良种管理区统计，收购将近二百万斤；东北辽东省至十月中，即已收购约六百万斤。现各地区除收花外，正进行棉种鉴定，在全国范围内来说，今年棉种工作比去年为好。但在良种收购工作中，还存在着下列一些问题，应该注意及时解决。
    一、收购良种籽棉的价格问题：今年的优良棉种，凡是发芽整齐的地区，一般均较当地原有品种产量高百分之十，绒长高一级以上，有的衣分也较大。许多商贩想套购良棉，因此皮棉、籽棉价格的好坏与换算的是否正确，都影响到良种收购。如十月初，唐山标准皮棉价七、九○○元，换算合理的籽棉价为二、七八○元，而花纱布公司牌价仅二、四五○元，市价则是二、六○○元。再如山东高密良种管理区，在九月底发生区内价格低于外围，私商收购外围之普通棉反高于良种管理区，因而群众不满，大量良种流失（良管区一斤标准皮棉七、六○○元、外围则达九、五○○元）。由于这一情况，加价百分之四亦不起作用。还有的地区未很好的和合作社配合，发生互相争购现象。更有的地区轧花厂直接到集上大量收购棉花，都影响到良种的混乱。这种现象目前虽已得到纠正，但在掌握良种以备明年推广的任务下，要使良种籽棉控制在良种收购机构内，皮棉籽棉价格的正确换算，及良种与非良种的一定差额，仍应及时注意掌握。
    二、良种加价百分之四的问题：今春许多地区发展良棉，事先未能提高价格收好籽棉轧棉种，却大量收购一般棉种，结果受到重大损失。为接受这一教训，乃规定对良种棉花加价百分之四予以收购，以鼓励农民好坏花分收，踊跃将良种籽棉送往良种收购机构，不使良种散失。加价范围，仅限于收购籽棉之良种管理区；但由于不少地区对这一精神的领会不深刻，也发生了很大偏差：（一）有些地方认为凡是良种，不论良管区及一般推广区都加价；（二）有的认为只良种管理区加价，普通区不加价是不公平的，所以要加都加，要不加则都不加；（三）认为加价是单纯奖励种良种，所以不论籽棉、皮棉都应加价；（四）有的地区未很好的执行良棉证，分级技术又较差，被棉贩钻了空子，把非良种区的棉花也运去卖，手续紊乱。棉农反映说：“良棉加价均让棉贩得去了。”这样不仅浪费了政府百分之四的加价费，农民还得到不良的种籽，影响明年推广。上述缺点，各有关部门应很好的加以纠正。
    三、部分地区良种轧花厂尚没有和良种管理区很好的结合，对棉种鉴定与整理的工作，由良种管理区派员驻厂办理，厂内只管轧花，因此严重地影响到良种质量的纯正，失去农业部门建厂轧花的意义。
    四、在保管工作上，由于仓库不足，再加疏于保管，籽棉、棉籽发霉者时有发生。据各地报告：平原省安阳专区邺县邵甲屯棉业改进社良种及普通籽棉共约三十万斤，堆存在敞棚或院中席地上，经过十月十三日的阴雨连绵，几乎全部遭受雨湿，雨后调查，其中约二十万斤籽棉（包括良种）发热生霉，籽棉变质，发芽的约八千斤；丰乐镇轧花厂亦有十六万斤棉籽着雨发热，不能作种；河北省南宫亦有二十万斤籽棉发热变质。有些轧花厂存放大量籽棉，轧不过来，也不肯去组织私营车子轧花，结果受到损失。
    五、各地对明年棉种的准备应如何注意解决呢？为完成明年扩大棉田与推广良棉所需的种籽，及解决一部灾区棉种的缺乏，在今冬明春就须做好棉种的收购与调运。在良种收购上，各有关部门应依据十月十四日中央贸易、农业二部发出确实保证合理棉价的指示，加以认真贯彻，以期控制良种以发挥加价百分之四的作用。普通棉籽亦应根据各地需要，由各级政府、合作社采用就地解决的办法加以调剂。但无论良种推广与普通种的调剂，均应作好种籽鉴定及保管、运输、推广工作，并建立必要的责任交接制度，以免重蹈去年棉种不好的复辙。
