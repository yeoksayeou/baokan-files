Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 8th. The people of Czechoslovakia and Poland warmly celebrate the great victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in defeating the American aggressor troops in Korea, and denounce Truman's war statement of November 30th. The Czechoslovak Communist Party's newspaper "Red Right" published a commentary on the 6th, stating: "MacArthur's so-called 'offensive' has suffered a tragic failure. The troops of the Anglo-American aggressors are either surrounded or fleeing south. In particular, the United States aggressors' proud Marine Corps has been completely surrounded in northeastern Korea. This victory has greatly alarmed the imperialist camp." The New Freedom newspaper of the Ostrava Regional Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party wrote on the 3rd under the title "Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Shatter MacArthur's 'General Offensive'": The working people of the world are excitedly watching the advance of the heroic troops defending Korea and wish them greater victories.

    The Polish "Warsaw Life" published an editorial on the 4th, stating: "MacArthur's playing with fire has resulted in the American aggressor troops fleeing in panic in the face of the powerful counteroffensive launched by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The vicious plan of the warmongers to expand the war in the Far East has helped to raise the people's vigilance and strengthen the counteroffensive forces of the peace camp."

    捷波人民欢庆朝鲜大捷
    并痛斥杜鲁门的战争叫嚣
    【新华社布拉格八日电】捷、波两国人民热烈庆祝朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜击溃美国侵略军的伟大胜利，并痛斥杜鲁门十一月三十日的战争声明。捷克共产党机关报《红色权利》报六日发表评论称：“麦克阿瑟的所谓《攻势》，业已遭到了悲惨的失败。美英侵略者的部队不是被包围就是向南逃窜，特别是美国侵略者所引为自豪的海军陆战队，已完全被包围在朝鲜的东北部了。这一胜利使帝国主义阵营大感恐慌。”捷共俄斯特拉发区党委报纸新自由报三日以朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队粉碎了麦克阿瑟的“总攻势”为题撰文称：全世界劳动人民都兴奋地注视着保卫朝鲜的英勇部队的挺进，并且预祝他们取得更大的胜利。
    波兰《华沙生活》报四日发表社论称：“麦克阿瑟玩火的结果就是：美国侵略军正在中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军所进行的强大反攻面前狼狈溃逃。战争贩子企图在远东扩大战争的恶毒计划，已帮助提高了人民的警惕和加强了和平阵营的反攻力量。”
