    More Than One Hundred Members of This Newspaper's Reading Group Send a Letter to This Newspaper
    Report Completion of Agricultural Tax and Resistance to America, Aid Korea
    Are Now Cooperating with Village Cadres in Carrying Out Propaganda Activities
    [This Newspaper's News] More than one hundred and eighty members of the reading group of Jia Village, Hunyuan, Chahar sent a letter to this newspaper on November 18, reporting that they had completed the agricultural tax task ahead of schedule to resist America and aid Korea, and were cooperating with village cadres to carry out propaganda activities. The original letter is as follows: Comrade Editor:
    We, the 186 members of the reading group, have taken practical actions to resist America and aid Korea. We are extremely indignant at the American imperialists' aggression against Korea, their bombing of our country's territory, and their intrusion into our country's borders. All 186 members unanimously completed the task of more than 62,000 jin of public grain five days ahead of schedule, and worked hard to mobilize more than 20 backward households to complete the task of public grain. We are now actively planning winter production to strengthen the forces resisting America and aiding Korea, and are raising vigilance to prevent sabotage by special agents. We are now cooperating with village cadres and the masses to organize a Yangko team, which is carrying out anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda activities along the streets and alleys. If the American imperialists frantically expand their aggression, we will unanimously join the Volunteer Army, fearing no sacrifice, and fight the American imperialists to the end. We have undergone eight years of anti-Japanese war training, built today's free, happy, and independent New China, and will never allow barbaric beasts to destroy it. We will resist America and aid Korea with an iron will. Sacrificing for the sake of defending our motherland and the peace-loving people of the world is also our glory! Elderly group member Li Chunjing encouraged the young and middle-aged group members Yuan Nairang, Pei Ziwen, and more than 20 others, saying: "You young people go to the front line to fight American imperialism, and we old people will produce in the rear to support the front line." Women also expressed: "We are determined to strengthen production, defend our homes and country, and will never be slaves to foreigners, or be bullied by foreign imperialism until death."
              The entire group of reading members of Jia Village, Hunyuan, Chahar

    我们读报组一百八十六个组员已用实际行动来抗美援朝。对美帝侵略朝鲜及轰炸我国领土侵扰我国边境，万分震怒。一百八十六个组员，一致把六万二千多斤公粮任务提前五天全部完成，并努力动员二十余户落后的人家也完成公粮任务。现在正积极计划冬季生产，加强抗美援朝的力量，并提高警惕，防止特务破坏。我们现正与村干部配合群众，组织起秧歌队，沿街转巷的展开了抗美援朝宣传的活动。如果美帝疯狂扩大侵略，我们即一致参加志愿军，不怕一切牺牲，与美帝拚命到底。我们已经过八年抗日的锻炼，建设起今天自由幸福独立的新中国，决不让蛮横的野兽来破坏。我们以钢铁的意志抗美援朝，为了保卫祖国和全世界爱好和平的人民，牺牲了也是我们的光荣！老年组员李春景勉励青壮年的组员袁乃让、裴子文等二十多人说：“你们青年上前线打美帝国主义，我们老年在后方生产，支援前线。”妇女们也表示：“决心加强生产，保家卫国，至死不当奴洋，不受外国帝国主义的欺侮。”
