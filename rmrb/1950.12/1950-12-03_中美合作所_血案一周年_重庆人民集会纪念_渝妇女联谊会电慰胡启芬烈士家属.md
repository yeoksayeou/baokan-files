(Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th) People from all walks of life in Chongqing held a memorial meeting on the 27th to commemorate the first anniversary of the martyrs who died in the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization." On November 27th of last year, on the eve of the liberation of Chongqing by our People's Liberation Army, the American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents and bandits collectively massacred more than 300 revolutionary patriots in the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," a murder machine in the suburbs of the city.

The memorial meeting was held in a solemn atmosphere. Among the dozens of family members of the martyrs present at the memorial meeting were gray-haired old parents, widows holding orphans, and brothers, sisters, nephews, or nieces of the martyrs. At the meeting, the family members of the martyrs recounted the tragic deaths of the martyrs, one word and one tear at a time. They solemnly swore: We will never forget the enemies who killed our loved ones—American imperialism and its running dogs, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. We will personally participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, to avenge our loved ones. Representatives from all walks of life and children then presented flags, flowers, and condolences to the families of the martyrs.

On the same day, the Chongqing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation also invited the women among the families of the martyrs to hold a memorial meeting. After the meeting, the families of the martyrs went to the Southwest People's Broadcasting Station to make a broadcast accusation. They accused the American and Chiang Kai-shek clique of their bloody crimes to the people of China and the world, and expressed their determination to take revenge.

[This Newspaper's Report] The Chongqing Women's Federation sent a telegram of condolence to the family of martyr Hu Qifen on the first anniversary of her death. Martyr Hu Qifen was a member of the Chinese Communist Party, originally named Yongxuan, from Xiangtan, Hunan. She was arrested by the Kuomintang bandits in the Heng Public House in Hebei on April 11, 1948, and imprisoned in the "Zhazidong" of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization." She was murdered on the evening of November 27, 1949. The condolence telegram from the Chongqing Women's Federation stated:

People's Daily, to the family of martyr Hu Qifen: Today is the anniversary of martyr Qifen's martyrdom. Looking at her portrait increases our grief. Fortunately, in the past year, the mainland has been completely liberated, and women have been thoroughly emancipated. However, the flames of war are spreading in neighboring countries, and American imperialism is becoming increasingly rampant. We vow to inherit martyr Qifen's legacy, eradicate feudal remnants, and eliminate the American aggressors. We hereby send our condolences.
