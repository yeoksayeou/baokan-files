    Resolutely Implement Pest and Disease Prevention Work

    This year, thanks to the correct leadership of governments at all levels and the active participation of the broad masses, a large-scale campaign to prevent and control pests and diseases has been launched in many parts of the country. This is an arduous struggle against natural disasters. The victory of this struggle has directly guaranteed farmers' production. In the practical actions of treating rice borers, locusts, and preventing and controlling various diseases and insects, the superstitious view that "pests are a natural disaster" has been gradually overcome, and confidence in the ability to defeat insect pests has begun to be established. There are also many new practical experiences in pest control technology. After the evaluation of models in various places, a large number of pest control pioneers and pest control models have emerged. All these gains and achievements have laid a favorable foundation for pest and disease prevention next year.

    However, pest and disease prevention work is a long-term struggle. In order to consolidate the existing achievements and defeat future pests and diseases, we must not only not slacken or be careless, but also seize the favorable opportunity to continue to fight against pests and diseases.

    The key to completing pest and disease prevention work lies in how to organize the masses, rely on the strength of the masses, and carry out all necessary preventive work to realize the basic principle of "prevention is more important than cure."

    A series of effective measures, such as improving cultivation methods, removing weeds from the fields, disinfecting seeds, digging up insect egg masses, removing diseased crop plants, and organizing field seed selection, should be carried out according to actual conditions, different regions, different periods, different crops, and different types of diseases and insects, and necessary organizational work and technical guidance should be provided. For example, in major rice-producing areas this year (such as Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu), an unprecedented four-season rice borer control campaign was launched, and preventive measures against rice borers were widely implemented, such as egg collection, moth trapping, plowing, destruction of rice roots, and water immersion, which were extremely effective. Currently, we should affirm the achievements, summarize the experience, and continue to carry out inspection and supervision to implement the rice borer control campaign.

    Seed disinfection work (such as seed mixing and seed soaking) has been initiated in some areas and widely promoted in others in North China, East China, Northeast China, and other parts of the country. Many farmers have benefited from increased production due to seed disinfection. Especially in Chahar Province, due to the severity of pests and diseases over the years, unprecedented crop losses have occurred, and the masses have formed a widespread cry for pesticides, seed disinfection, and technical guidance. However, according to this year's experience, in order to do this work well, it is necessary to hold short-term training courses to educate cadres and the masses, strengthen technical guidance with scientific practice and demonstration methods, and prevent unnecessary waste and losses.

    Collecting and excavating insect egg masses is a thorough way to prevent insect pests and has been repeatedly proven effective for many years. This year, in Shen County, Hebei Province, 109 villages mobilized more than 8,000 people every day to thoroughly carry out egg collection work, thus minimizing the occurrence of armyworms (cutworms) this year.

    Organizing the masses to remove weeds from the fields should be considered an important task to prevent and reduce the occurrence of diseases. Taking some areas of Shijiazhuang Prefecture in Hebei as an example, women and children were mobilized to remove weeds from 210,000 mu of fields this year. In some areas of southern Shanxi Province, an aphid prevention and weed removal campaign was organized, which reduced the damage caused by aphids. Local leaders should promote and repeatedly explain these simple and effective measures to cadres and the masses, and actively carry out weed removal campaigns.

    In cotton-growing areas, cotton yields have been greatly reduced due to the harm of cotton aphids and red spiders. At present, preparations for aphid control agents must be made as soon as possible. This year, Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province prepared 400,000 jin of tobacco leaves to control aphids, ensuring increased cotton production. However, tobacco leaves are now in short supply, and it will be difficult to supply them in large quantities. Therefore, in areas where conditions permit, we can actively prepare to manufacture cotton oil soap and distribute it to various places at any time to prevent and control cotton aphids.

    In order to ensure increased grain and cotton production next year, we should take active action to overcome pests and diseases.

### 认真贯彻防治病虫害工作

    认真贯彻防治病虫害工作
    今年由于各级政府的正确领导、与广大群众的积极行动，在全国不少地区，已掀起了大规模的防除病虫害运动，这是面对自然灾害的一个艰苦斗争。由于这一斗争的胜利，直接保障了农民的生产。在治螟、治蝗以及防治各种病虫的实际行动中，逐步克服了“害虫是天灾”的迷信观点，开始建立了虫害可以战胜的信心。在防除病虫技术上也有许多新的实际经验，各地经过评模结果，涌现出大批治虫先锋、治虫模范。所有这些收获与成效，给明年防治病虫害打下了有利条件。
    但是，防治病虫害工作，是一个长期的斗争，为了巩固已有的成果，战胜未来的病虫害，不仅不能松懈大意，更应抓紧有利时机，继续与病虫害作斗争。
    完成防治病虫工作的关键，在于如何把群众组织起来，依靠群众力量，进行一切必要的预防工作，实现“防重于治”的基本方针。
    改良耕作方法、清除田间杂草、进行种子消毒、挖掘害虫卵块、拔除作物病株、组织田间选种等一系列的有效措施，应该根据实际情况，分别地区、分别时期、分别作物、分别病虫种类，进行必要的组织工作与技术指导。如今年在主要产稻地区（如浙江、苏南），曾经展开了史无前例的四季治螟运动，普遍推行了预防螟害措施，如采卵、捕蛾、耕地、毁灭稻根、浸水等方法，收效极为显著，目前应该肯定成绩，总结经验，继续进行检查与督促，以贯彻治螟运动。
    种子消毒工作（如拌种、浸种），在华北、华东、东北以及其他部分地区，有的已开始提倡，有的已普遍推广。不少农民由于种子经过消毒，已获增产利益。特别是在察哈尔省，历年来由于病虫害的严重，造成作物的空前减产，群众要求农药，要求种子消毒，要求技术指导，已形成普遍的呼声。惟根据今年经验证明：这一工作要能做好，必须举办短期训练班，教育干部，教育群众，以科学实习及表演方法，加强技术指导，以防止不应有的浪费与损失。
    采掘害虫卵块，是预防虫害的彻底办法，多年以来，一再行之有效。今年在河北省深县地区，有一百零九个村，每天动员到八千人以上，彻底进行了采卵工作，因而使今年行军虫（黏虫）发生很少。
    为防止与减少病害发生，组织群众清除田间杂草，应认为是重要工作。以河北石家庄专区部分地区为例，今年曾发动妇女儿童拔除田间杂草二十一万亩。山西省晋南部分地区，组织了防蚜除草运动，致减轻了蚜虫的为害。这种简单易行的有效措施，各地领导上，应在干部中、群众中，进行督促与反复的说明，积极开展除草运动。
    在植棉地区，由于棉蚜、红蜘蛛为害，棉花产量损失甚大，目前必须及早准备治蚜药剂。今年河北邯郸专区，曾准备了四十万斤烟叶治蚜，保证了棉花的增产。但烟叶现已缺乏，大量供给将感困难，因此，在有条件地区，可积极准备制造棉油皂，随时分发各地，防治棉蚜。
    为了保证明年粮棉增产，应该积极行动起来，战胜病虫灾害。
