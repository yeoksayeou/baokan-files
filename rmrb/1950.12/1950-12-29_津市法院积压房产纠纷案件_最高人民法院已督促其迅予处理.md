    Tianjin Municipal Court's Backlogged Property Dispute Cases
    The Supreme People's Court Urges Prompt Handling
To the Editorial Staff:
    Regarding the property rights dispute case between reader Zhou Kaicheng and Liu Shenzhi, which you forwarded to us on December 16th, concerning its backlog in the Tianjin Municipal People's Court for over a year without a verdict, since this court is unaware of the specific facts of the case and does not know the handling process by the Tianjin Court, we have already handed the original document to Wang Xiaoyi, the President of the Tianjin Municipal Court, to investigate and resolve it promptly; and we have informed him that if it cannot be resolved quickly, he must explain the reasons to the parties involved.
    General Office of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, December 26th

    津市法院积压房产纠纷案件
    最高人民法院已督促其迅予处理编辑同志：
    本年十二月十六日你们寄来关于读者周凯诚与刘慎之产权纠纷案所谈在天津市人民法院积压一年多始终未判，因为本院不了解该案具体事实，又不知津院之处理经过，故已将原件交天津市院王笑一院长查明即予解决；并且告诉他如不能迅速解决，亦须向当事人说明原因。
    中央人民政府最高人民法院办公厅十二月二十六日
