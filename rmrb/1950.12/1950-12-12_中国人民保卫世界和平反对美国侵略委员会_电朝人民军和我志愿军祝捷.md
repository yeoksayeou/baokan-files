Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: The China Peace Committee today sent a telegram to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers congratulating them on their victory. The telegram reads:

To the heroic soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers:

You are standing on the front line of resisting American imperialist aggression, rapidly and thoroughly defeating MacArthur's general offensive, and re-planting the victory flag, symbolizing happiness and hope, on Pyongyang. This brilliant victory demonstrates the inviolable great strength of the Chinese and Korean peoples, inspires the liberation struggles of oppressed nations throughout Asia, and strengthens the strong belief of people all over the world in defending peace. We extend our highest respect to you and cheer for you!

Dear heroes! Your great achievements on the snowy mountains and fields of North Korea, regardless of hardship, have greatly reduced the arrogance of imperialist aggression. However, the imperialists have not abandoned their plans for aggression. The Chinese and Korean peoples must make persistent efforts and continue to struggle to liberate the whole of Korea and ensure peace in the Far East. The entire Chinese people are launching a broader and more in-depth movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and are working harder to support your operations. We wish you more victories and that you drive the aggressors into the sea as soon as possible!

China Peace Committee
