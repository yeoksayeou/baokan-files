When this reporter entered the office of Military Representative Xu Dawen in Ganzi County, it was already crowded with people. There was the disciplinarian Lama Gegu from Ganzi Monastery, Gongga Jiangze from the Masu Tusi family, Yixi Duoji from the Kongsa Tusi family, and Zaxi, the owner of the Niuchang pasture from Kongsa Township.

They were holding a meeting to discuss the exchange ratio of livestock for qing稞 (barley) by the masses in the pasture and to regulate prices in Ganzi. The purpose of the meeting was to set appropriate prices for various goods to prevent the pasture herders from suffering losses in the exchange of goods.

Through a translator, everyone present spoke, and some even offered specific suggestions.

Baozheng Zaxi believed that the People's Government should set uniform prices in Daozi, Luhuo, Ganzi, and Zhanhua to avoid the impact of different prices in one area on other areas. At the same time, the People's Government should restrict unscrupulous merchants from purchasing in large quantities to avoid stimulating price increases.

Lama Gegu explained that a yak was currently worth 100 Tibetan silver dollars, which was too low, and pasture herders often suffered losses when exchanging goods. Therefore, the price of large yaks should be increased to 120 Tibetan silver dollars per head.

The meeting, based on the market situation in Ganzi, reasonably set prices for yak, qing稞 (barley), butter, salt, milk residue, etc.

They discussed the issues with such meticulousness, taking the price of beef as an example, specifying the prices for leg meat, shank meat, and neck meat.

Issues were raised one by one, and after consultation and general agreement, they were submitted to the government for unified implementation. The military representative presiding over the meeting fully respected the opinions of those present. When the topic involved the pasture, the people from the pasture were allowed to express their opinions as much as possible. When the representatives raised questions, they were explained and answered as much as possible.

Comrade Xu Dawen told the reporter that such meetings were held every few days, or even every day. In government work, important matters were discussed with all strata of the Tibetan people, especially the Tusi and Lamas, and implemented only after their consent was obtained. This strengthened the connection between the People's Government and the Tibetan people from all walks of life, and things were handled more quickly and problems could be solved through them.

He also told the reporter that in the five months since the liberation of Ganzi, the office of the military representative had been visited every day by Tibetan men and women from the four townships of Ganzi to request solutions to various problems. They put forward many opinions and suggestions to the government, and they also came up with many methods. Indeed, during the reporter's contact with the Ganzi military representative, he personally saw many Tibetan people coming to the military representative. A pasture owner from Mashu Township brought a bag of Tibetan green fruit and asked the military representative: Could this gift be given to Chairman Mao by Liu, the head of the central government delegation? Would Chairman Mao like to eat Tibetan green fruit?

The above situation never existed during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. "The eight-character yamen faces south, don't come in if you have reason but no money." Before liberation, the common people did not dare to enter the "yamen" of the "official". However, in just five months since the liberation of Ganzi, the Tibetan people have established close ties with the People's Government and developed deep feelings. Although the Ganzi military representative's office today is located in the former site of the reactionary Kuomintang county government, today the Tibetan people are coming to their own government in an endless stream. They have recognized this point, and they have realized that the People's Government is truly doing things for them.

At the first Kangding County People's Representative Conference, this reporter personally witnessed how the Tibetan and Yi representatives concentrated their minds to jointly consult and solve major issues closely related to their lives, such as disaster relief and supporting the army. Over the past year, during the reporter's contact with the fraternal nationalities in Qinghai, Gansu, and Xikang, I have deeply realized that consultation with people from all nationalities and all walks of life through various types of meetings is one of the most effective and best ways to implement the various policies and decrees of the People's Government. At the same time, it is also the best bridge to improve ethnic relations and harmonize ethnic feelings.

    和藏族各阶层协商办事
    当记者走进甘孜县军事代表徐达文同志的办公室时，里面已经挤满了人。这里有甘孜喇嘛寺执法师格规喇嘛，有麻书土司家的贡呷降泽，孔萨土司家的益喜多吉，还有孔萨乡保正牛场主人扎喜等。
    他们在开会，商议牛场群众用牲口换取青稞的比值和规定甘孜物价问题。会议的目的，在订出各种物品适当的价格，不使牛场牧人在交换货物当中吃亏。
    通过翻译，每一位到会的人都讲话了，有的还提出了具体的建议。
    扎喜保正认为人民政府应该在道子、炉霍、甘孜、瞻化一带规定出统一的物价，以免一地物价的不同影响到其他各地的物价。同时，人民政府应该限制不法商人大量收购，以免刺激物价上升。
    格规喇嘛说明目前一头牦牛值一百元藏洋，价格过低，牛场牧人交换物品时往往吃亏，因此应该将大型牦牛的价格提高到每头一百二十元藏洋。
    会议根据甘孜市场情况，合理的订出牦牛、青稞、酥油、食盐、奶渣等的价格。
    他们讨论问题是那样的细致，拿牛肉的价钱来说，规定出大腿肉、小腿肉是什么价钱，颈圈肉又是什么价钱。
    问题一项一项的提出，经过磋商和大家同意后，交由政府统一执行。主持会议的军事代表是充分地尊重到会者的意见的。当议题涉及牛场时，让牛场的人尽量发表他们的意见。当代表们提出问题时，尽量的予以解释和答复。
    徐达文同志告诉记者：这样的会议是隔不了几天，甚至每天都有的。政府工作中，重要的事项，通过藏族各阶层，特别是土司喇嘛，得到他们同意，然后才执行。这样密切了人民政府和藏族各界人民的联系，通过他们事情也办得比较迅速，也能解决问题。
    他还告诉记者：甘孜解放以来五个多月中，军事代表的办公处，每天都有甘孜四乡的藏族男女前来要求解决各种问题，他们对政府提出了许多意见和建议，他们还想出了许多办法。的确，在记者和甘孜军事代表接触当中，就亲眼看到许多藏族人民来找军事代表。一个来自麻书乡的牛场主人带来了一包藏青果，他问问军事代表：是不是可以将这包礼物请中央访问团刘团长带给毛主席呢？毛主席喜不喜欢吃藏青果呢？
    上述情形在国民党反动统治时期是从来没有的。“八字衙门朝南开，有理无钱莫进来。”解放前，老百姓是不敢进“官大人”的“衙门”的。然而甘孜解放仅五个月中，藏族人民就和人民政府建立了密切的联系，发生了深厚的感情，尽管今天甘孜军事代表办公处就是从前国民党反动县政权所在地，但是，今天藏族人民络绎不绝来找的是他们自己的政府，他们已经认清了这一层，他们已经体会到人民政府是在真正的为他们办事情。
    康定县第一届各族各界代表会议，记者亲自看到藏、彝各族代表是怎样聚精会神地共同协商，共同解决和他们生活密切有关的救灾、拥军等重大问题。一年多来，记者和青海、甘肃、西康各兄弟民族接触过程中，深深地体会到通过各种类型的会议和各族各界人民协商，是贯彻人民政府各项政策和法令最有效果和最好的方式之一。同时也是搞好民族关系和融洽民族情感最好的桥梁。
