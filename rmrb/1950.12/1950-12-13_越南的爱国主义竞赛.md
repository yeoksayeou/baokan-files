    Vietnam's Patriotic Emulation Campaign
    By Ding, Secretary of the Viet Lien (National United Front) Zone

    Before becoming a democratic republic, Vietnam was subjected to eighty years of oppression by French colonialists and five years of enslavement by France and Japan. The republic inherited a terrible legacy of poverty, ignorance, and hunger. For example, in the spring of 1945, two million people died of starvation in Beidu (Tokyo).

    Less than a month after the young republic was founded, it was attacked in the south by French colonial troops and in the north by 200,000 Kuomintang troops.

    At that time, Vietnam had only a newly organized and small army, lacking officers, weapons, and experience, and also lacking necessary funding. In government agencies, government cadres lacked experience, while the technical cadres left over from the old regime lacked sincerity.

    Internationally, Vietnam was surrounded by hostile forces: its neighbors were Siam, the Philippines, and China, all ruled by reactionaries.

    However, the leaders of Vietnam did not lose heart. They fought with the conviction that they would win, relying on three basic factors: the determination to achieve victory, the enthusiasm of the people, and the power of the world's democratic forces.

    In domestic politics, the undeniable achievements of the five-year heroic struggle against the French colonialists supported by American imperialism, as well as the complete victory of democratic China and the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, all proved that the leaders of the new Vietnam were correct.

    I

    To deal with the young and small Vietnamese army (whose troops in the south were called "Bamboo Stick" teams because all their weapons were bamboo sticks), the French colonialists投入了 more than 120,000 land, sea, and air forces. Their best strategist, General Leclerc, commander of the expeditionary force, predicted that he could reconquer all of Vietnam in less than three months. Leclerc adopted Hitler's popular "blitzkrieg" tactics.

    In order to thwart the aggressors' plans, in order to destroy numerically superior and well-equipped troops, the leaders of the young republic called on the people to engage in a long-term resistance.

    A year later, Leclerc abandoned command of the expeditionary force, claiming that it would take at least 500,000 French troops to defeat the Viet Minh (Vietnam Independence League).

    In this way, Vietnam achieved its initial victory, namely, thwarting the enemy's war plan.

    However, in order to carry the long-term resistance to the end, it was necessary to increase the manpower of the Vietnamese armed forces, improve the administrative organs, and ensure that the people were fed and clothed. But how to put all this into practice in a country that was devastated and besieged?

    In order to solve this complex and arduous task, the Vietnamese government launched a patriotic emulation movement in October 1947, following the socialist competition experiences of the Soviet Union and the liberated areas of China.

    President Ho Chi Minh stipulated the tasks, goals, and methods of this movement as follows:

    Task:—— Intensify production, improve the quality and quantity of products;

    Goal:—— Eliminate hunger and ignorance, and drive out the enemy—the French invaders;

    Method:—— To achieve this goal, one must be "Diligent," "Frugal," "Honest," and "Sincere."

    This slogan was enthusiastically responded to by the army, administrative organs, factories, and all the people.

    To launch this movement, such an inspiring moment was chosen: when the small Vietnamese army had just completely crushed the enemy's offensive against Viet Bac (north of Tokyo). Thus, the competition quickly spread to the whole country, and even to the enemy-occupied areas.

    II

    After two months of preparation, the army began the competition movement in January 1948 under the slogan of "Mastering military technology, creating military exploits!"

    The enthusiasm was great, but the difficulties were many. Because there was no fixed front in the patriotic war, some troops could conduct systematic training better, while other troops had to repel the enemy's attacks at all times.

    Despite these difficulties, satisfactory achievements were obtained by the end of the year: on average, 90 percent of the soldiers received adequate military training; 80 percent became first-class shooters during live ammunition exercises; 70 percent were able to throw grenades 35 meters away; some troops were able to walk nine kilometers fully armed in 41 minutes; the stockades around French strongholds could be completely removed in two minutes. In short, officers and soldiers learned military technology.

    In May 1949, the competition entered its second phase under two new slogans: "Improve the technical skills of officers and cadres!" and "Reorganize the army!"

    At the end of the first phase of the competition, it became clear that although the soldiers had made considerable achievements, the officers and cadres had not yet reached the expected level. The reason was very simple: most of the officers were workers and peasants. They were excellent guerrillas, but they were a little "not so good" at modern warfare technology.

    Schools were opened to reform old cadres and train new cadres. The regular army was strengthened. Local armed forces were organized in every county, district, and capital. The guerrillas were also strengthened. Committees were established in the army to ensure the democratic nature of the army and the brotherly unity between officers and soldiers. These committees also made extensive use of criticism and self-criticism.

    III

    At the same time as the competition was launched in the army, the patriotic emulation movement quickly unfolded in the armaments factories. It should be pointed out that the word "factory" is a bit of an exaggeration here; it would be more accurate to call them armaments workshops. Moreover, they lacked machines, tools, and raw materials. Furthermore, these workshops had to move around to avoid enemy attacks.

    Workers showed infinite creativity and boundless heroism in this situation. The slogan of their patriotic emulation campaign was: "Equip the workshops, create new records!"

    The workers repaired old machines captured from the enemy. They collected many different parts from various places and then made them into new machines. They searched for and found many substitutes for urgently needed raw materials. The boiler of a locomotive was brought to the workshop for use. The workers' ingenuity helped to find labor methods to compensate for the lack of technical knowledge.

    During work, they often had to dismantle factories and machines and move them to safer places dozens of kilometers away from the original site. The workers carried the machines on their backs, climbed over steep, wooded slopes, and waded across rivers.

    Despite countless difficulties, the workers learned to manufacture modern weapons, such as anti-tank "rocket" guns, mortars, and small cannons. Thanks to the great efforts of the workers, the Vietnamese army is gradually improving its equipment. At the same time, the friendship between the soldiers on the front line and the workers is being strengthened.

    In addition to the production competition, male and female workers also participated in other forms of competition. They were learning to read and write. Those who had acquired some knowledge taught others. In this way, illiteracy among male and female workers has been almost completely eliminated. The workers cultivated fallow land and turned it into vegetable gardens; they raised livestock to improve their diet, because food was sometimes difficult to obtain. They sent troops to guard their crops, and these troops fought bravely against the enemy on many occasions.

    The first Stakhanovite worker in Vietnam, Wu Wenfu, was a young armaments worker in the Fourth Military Region. He overfulfilled his production quota by 36 percent. But this record was quickly broken by many other workers. For example, Huang Wenwan completed 377 percent of his production quota; Hu Badong completed 402 percent, and Chen Heqing completed 439 percent. As a result of this patriotic emulation, almost all factory workers exceeded their production quotas by 15 to 20 percent.

    It must also be mentioned that the workers in the enemy-occupied areas have begun to compete in sabotaging the enemy's economy. Here are some figures for the first six months of this year: In Hongji, the enemy's estimated losses totaled 144,245,828 Vietnamese dong; in Haiphong, 17 kilometers of the Guajin power station's water line were destroyed; in Hanoi, 19 trams, 22 airplanes, and 7 transformer stations were destroyed; in the Chinese suburbs of Saigon and Dike, the enemy's estimated losses totaled 5.3 million Vietnamese dong; in Bianhe, 2,300 hectares of rubber plantations and 2,000 tons of rubber sap were destroyed; in Jiading, four locomotives were destroyed.

    IV

    The greatest and most remarkable achievement was the competition to eliminate illiteracy. Thousands of young men and women volunteered to be teachers. They carried their schoolbags to the countryside to teach, without pay or any other compensation. They were provided with meals by the villagers, but often they provided them from their own homes.

    New schools sprang up like mushrooms after a rain. They were often huts built by the teachers and students themselves. Private residences were sometimes used as schools. Due to a state of war and isolation from the outside world, Vietnam lacked many things in this respect, as in many other respects: paper, pencils, ink, and pens. Without paper, they wrote on banana leaves or sand. They used coal, bricks, and bamboo branches instead of pens and pencils. Everyone, young and old, male and female, was learning. Families helped each other, and villages helped each other. Even in remote and almost inaccessible hamlets, many people were learning the alphabet.

    When work stopped at noon and in the evening, female workers and peasants sat on benches in the school, often holding babies and with children tugging at their clothes. Old men and women over eighty also participated in the competition. A ninety-year-old veteran wrote to President Ho Chi Minh, "I have just received my school diploma. I am now writing my first letter to you in my own handwriting! I thank you for opening my eyes and ears. I am very happy now. When I leave this world, I will be a free and literate citizen." A five-year-old child wrote a five-word letter to President Ho Chi Minh on his birthday: "Long live Uncle Ho!"

    I will now give a few examples to illustrate the heroism shown by the people in this competition. Many teachers and students worked as porters, felled timber, or fished in rice paddies to buy lamps and oil for night school.

    A teacher from Nanding, who was a cripple, disregarded many difficulties and walked to a school three kilometers away to teach his compatriots to read and write.

    By the end of 1949, the achievements in the competition were as follows: in minority areas, 65 percent of the residents learned to read and write; in other areas, the average literacy rate is now 85 percent. Many provinces (Guangnan, Guangyi, Hejing, Taiping, etc.) have completely eliminated illiteracy. If one thinks that 95 percent of the Vietnamese people were illiterate under the rule of the French and Japanese colonialists, then these achievements are not bad.

    In terms of primary and secondary education, the achievements were few due to the lack of teachers, schools, and textbooks. Even so, the number of students has doubled.

    V

    In the countryside, the patriotic emulation campaign takes various forms, and it can be seen in almost all kinds of work. But the main attention is focused on increasing agricultural production.

    It is precisely because of this that during the five years of the patriotic war, despite the systematic looting and destruction of crops, livestock, and agricultural implements by the French army, the people have not starved. In areas far from the front lines, living standards have improved greatly.

    It must be added that under the French colonial regime, floods regularly inundated the rural areas, followed by famine. But under the rule of the democratic republic, the rural residents are engaged in a competition to repair dikes and prevent catastrophic floods.

    The villages are competing to pay public grain. The village that pays its taxes first wins glory. Families and villages are participating in a competition to comply with hygiene regulations.

    Here is a very interesting fact: In 1949, during the celebration of Independence Day (September 2), President Ho Chi Minh called on the people to sell rice to the army. The announced price was five Vietnamese dong per kilogram of rice, while the market price was twenty Vietnamese dong per kilogram. In response to President Ho Chi Minh's call, a competition was launched to sell more. Poor peasants, even children—the Pioneers—asked for work in order to be able to sell rice to the army. Despite the lean season and despite the fact that it lasted only two weeks, the amount of rice collected exceeded 100,000 tons.

    The competition is also reflected in helping the local forces. For example, the residents of the Suihe area (Phu Yen province) donated 42 million Vietnamese dong in one day to maintain the local forces, part of which was donated in rice and livestock. The residents of Shouchun District (Qinghua Province) donated 14 million Vietnamese dong. Other areas and provinces also raised large sums of money. Considering the conditions of the people, one can fully realize the meaning of these great efforts and the great patriotism that supports them.

    The patriotic emulation campaign is also reflected in volunteering to join the army. Provinces and mass organizations (workers, peasants, women, youth) are participating in this competition. The number of volunteers is so large that the quotas of the recruitment committees are quickly filled. The number of volunteers is double or even two and a half times the original number. For example, in the first six months of this year, although only 2,230 people were needed, 7,250 of the 9,215 students in secondary schools in Qinghua, Yian, and Hejing provinces volunteered to join the army.

    It should be pointed out that many overseas Chinese living in Vietnam are also actively participating in this patriotic emulation campaign. Overseas Chinese worker Chen Wentai was praised by the armaments workshop union as the most outstanding foreman. The overseas Chinese in Fuan City donated 25 mu of land (each mu is one-sixteenth of a hectare) and 50,000 Vietnamese dong to the local forces.

    The patriotic movement could achieve more remarkable achievements if it could remove the various difficulties in the way of this movement. These difficulties can be divided into two categories: external difficulties—lack of materials and transportation due to the war, etc., and internal difficulties—lack of skilled leading cadres, lack of an overall plan. As a result, many mistakes and shortcomings have arisen, such as unnecessary waste of effort, tendencies toward formalism, pursuit of records, failure to learn from the experience of others, etc.

    However, despite these shortcomings, the patriotic emulation campaign marks a historical turning point in the patriotic war. It shows all the people, especially the working class, that their creative genius and construction capacity are endless. It strengthens and consolidates the people's confidence in victory and in the future.

    越南的爱国主义竞赛
    越联（民族统一战线）区书记  丁
    越南在它成为一个民主共和国以前，曾受到法国殖民者八十年的压迫，以及法国和日本的五年奴役。共和国承继了一笔可怕的遗产，即贫困、无知和饥饿。譬如，一九四五年春在北都（东京）就有两百万人死于饥饿。
    年青的共和国成立还不到一个月，就在南方受到法国殖民军，在北方受到二十万国民党军队的进攻。
    当时，越南只有一支刚组织起来的实力不大的军队，一支缺乏军官、武器和经验，并且还缺乏必要经费的军队，在政府机关里，政府干部缺乏经验，而旧政权遗留下来的技术干部却又缺乏诚意。
    在国际方面，越南是处在敌性的包围之中：它的邻国是由反动派统治的暹逻、菲律宾及中国。
    但是，越南的领袖们并不灰心。他们带着必胜的信念进行斗争，而所依赖的三个基本因素就是：争取胜利的决心，人民的热情和世界民主力量的威力。
    在国内政治方面，对美帝国主义支持下的法国殖民者进行五年英勇斗争的确凿无疑的成绩，以及国际方面民主中国的完全胜利、苏联和人民民主国家的辉煌成就，都证明新越南的领袖们是正确的。
    一
    为了对付年青而实力不大的越南军队（其在南方的部队称为“竹杖”队，因为全部武器都是竹杖），法国殖民者投入了十二万以上的陆、海、空军。他们最好的战略家，远征军司令故勒克莱将军曾预测说：不要三个月就可以重新征服全越南。勒克莱袭用了风靡一时的希特勒的“闪击”战术。
    为了挫败侵略者的计划，为了摧毁在数量上占优势且装备精良的部队，年青共和国的领袖们便号召人民进行长期抵抗。
    一年之后，勒克莱放弃了远征军的指挥权，声称：要打败越盟（越南独立同盟），至少需要五十万法军。
    这样一来，越南取得了它的初步胜利，即挫败了敌人的战争计划。
    但是，为了把长期抗战进行到底，必须增加越南武装部队的兵员，改进行政机构，并使人民温饱。但是在一个遭到破坏和围困的国家里如何把这一切付诸实现呢？
    为了解决这个复杂而艰巨的任务、越南政府依照苏联和中国解放区的社会主义竞赛的经验，于一九四七年十月发动了一个爱国主义竞赛运动。
    胡志明主席规定了这一运动的任务，目标和方法如下：
    任务：——加紧生产，提高产品的品质和数量；
    目标：——消灭饥饿与愚昧，把敌人——法国侵略者驱逐出去；
    方法：——为达到此一目的必须“勤”，“俭”，“廉”，“诚”。
    这个口号获得了军队、行政机构、工厂及全体人民的热烈响应。
    为了发动这个运动，选择了这样的一个振奋人心的时机：实力不大的越南军队刚刚完全粉碎了敌人对于越北（东京北部）的攻势的时候。于是竞赛便迅速发展到全国，甚至发展到敌占区。
    二
    经两个月的准备后，军队就在“掌握军事技术，创造军事功勋！”的口号下于一九四八年一月开始了竞赛运动。
    热情是很大的，但困难也很多。因为在爱国战争中没有固定的战线，有些部队可以较好的进行有系统的训练，而其他的部队却必须时时要打退敌人的进犯。
    尽管有这些困难，但到了年底就获得了满意的成就：平均来说，有百分之九十的兵员得到了充分的军事训练；百分之八十在实弹演习期间成为第一流的射击手；百分之七十能够投手榴弹达三十五米远；某些部队能够全副武装在四十一分钟内走九公里路；法军据点周围的鹿砦能够在两分钟之内被全部拔除。总而言之，官兵们学会了军事技术。
    一九四九年五月，竞赛在下列两个新的口号下进入了第二个阶段：“改进军官干部的技术！”“整编军队！”
    在竞赛的第一阶段结束时，事实表明：虽然士兵们已取得相当的成就，但是军官干部们却还没有达到预期的地步。原因非常简单：军官大多数是工人和农民。他们都是刮刮叫的游击队，但在现代化的战争技术上却有点“不大在行”。
    开办了改造老干部和训练新干部的学校。正规军增强了。每一个县、区和首都组织了地方武装部队。游击队也增强了。军队中成立了委员会，以确保军队中的民主特质和官兵间的兄弟般的团结。这些委员会里并广泛地运用了批评与自我批评。
    三
    与在军队中展开竞赛同时，爱国主义竞赛运动也迅速地在军火工厂里展开了。应该指出这里用“工厂”的字眼是有点太夸大了；宁可说是军火作坊。而且，它们缺乏机器、工具和原料，然而不仅如此，这些作坊还不得不到处转移以免遭受敌人的袭击。
    工人们在这种情况下表现了无穷的创造性和无限的英雄主义。他们的爱国主义竞赛的口号是：“把作坊装备起来，创造新纪录！”
    工人们修复了从敌人那里缴获过来的旧机器。他们由各个地方收集许多不同的零件，然后将它们做成新的机器。他们搜索并发现了许多急需原料的代用品。把机车上的汽锅拿到作坊来用。工人们的机智有助于找寻出劳动方法以弥补技术知识的不足。
    在工作期间，他们经常要拆卸工厂和机器，把它们转移到距原来厂址数十公里的较安全的地方去。工人们把机器掮在背上，爬过险峻的林木茂密的山坡和涉水渡河。
    尽管有无数的困难，但工人们学会了制造现代化的武器，例如反坦克用的“火箭”炮、迫击炮以及小型炮等等。由于工人们的伟大的努力，越南军队正在逐步地改进它们的装备。同时，前线士兵与工人们之间的友谊也正在加强着。
    男女工人们除了生产竞赛外，还参加了他种形式的竞赛。他们在学习读书和写字。那些已经学得了某些知识的人就教给别人。这样，男女工人中的文盲差不多已经完全被消除了。工人们耕种休耕地，把它们变为菜园；他们培肓牲畜以改善伙食，因为粮食有时是困难的。他们派部队来守护他们的庄稼，这些部队曾多次英勇地对敌人进行了斗争。
    越南的第一个斯达哈诺夫工人吴文富，是第四军区的一个年青的军火工人。他超额完成生产定额的百分之三十六。但是这个纪录很快就被其他许多工人打破了。譬如黄文万完成了生产定额的百分之三百七十七；胡巴东完成百分之四百零二，而陈河庆则完成了百分之四百三十九。由于这一爱国主义竞赛，几乎所有的工厂工人都超过了他们生产定额的百分之十五到二十。
    还必须说一说的就是：敌占区的工人们已开始进行破坏敌人经济的竞赛。兹举今年头六个月的一些数字如下：在鸿基，估计敌人损失共达一亿四千四百二十四万五千八百二十八越币；在海防，破坏了瓜金电力站的十七公里水线；在河内，破坏了十九辆电车，二十二架飞机和七个变压站；在西贡的华人郊区和堤岸，估计敌人损失达五百三十万越币；在边和，摧毁了二千三百公顷的橡胶园和二千吨橡胶汁；在嘉定，破坏了四个火车头。
    四
    获得最大和最显著的成绩的是消除文盲的竞赛。数以千计的青年男女都自愿当教师。他们背着书包到乡村里去教书，不要报酬也不要任何其他报偿。他们由村民们供给膳食，但常常都由他们自己的家里供给。
    新的学校正像雨后春笋一样地创设起来。它们常常是由教师和学生自己建造起来的茅屋。私人住宅有时也被用作学校。由于处在一种战争和与外界隔绝的状态当中，越南在这方面正如在其他许多方面一样，缺少许多东西：纸张，铅笔，墨水和钢笔。没有纸，他们就写在香蕉叶或沙上面。并以煤炭、砖块和竹枝代替钢笔和铅笔。不论男女老少，大家都在学习。家庭与家庭相互帮助，村与村相互帮助。甚至在遥远的和几乎不能到达的小村落里，许多人都在学习字母。
    当中午和傍晚歇工时，女工和农妇们就坐在学校里的凳子上，常常抱着婴儿和带着扯住衣衫的儿童。年逾八十的老头儿和老婆婆们也都参加了竞赛。一位九十岁的老兵写信给胡志明主席说：“我刚刚得到我的学校的文凭。我现在写第一封自己写的信给你！我感激你打开了我的眼睛和耳朵。我现在非常高兴。在我离开尘世时，我已是一个自由而且识字的公民。”有一个五岁的儿童在胡志明主席寿辰的时候写了一封五个字的信给他：“胡伯伯万岁！”
    我现在要举几个例子，来说明人民在这个竞赛中所表现的英雄主义。许多教师和学生当挑夫，砍伐木材或在稻田捕鱼，以便购买夜校用的灯和油。
    来自南定的一位教师，是一个跛子，但他不顾许多困难，还是走到三公里以外的学校去教他的同胞们读书和写字。
    到一九四九年底，竞赛方面所获得的成绩如下：在少数民族地区，百分之六十五的居民学会了读书和写字；在其他地区，现在识字的人平均为百分之八十五。有许多省（广南，广义，河靖，太平等），已完全消灭了文盲。如果想一想在法国和日本殖民者的统治时期，百分之九十五的越南人民都是文盲的话，那么这些成绩就不算坏的了。
    在初级和中级教育方面，由于缺少教师、学校和教科书，所获得的成绩很少。即使如此，学生的人数已增加了一倍。
    五
    在乡村，爱国主义竞赛具有各种不同的形式，而且几乎在各种工作中都可以看到。但主要的注意力集中在增加农业产量上。
    正是由于这一点，所以在五年的爱国战争期间，尽管法国军队有系统地掠夺和横加毁坏庄稼、牲畜及农具，但人民并没有受饿。在远离前线的地区，生活水平已大为提高了。
    必须补充一点，在法国殖民政权统治下，洪水定期泛滥于乡村地区，随着来的就是饥馑。但在民主共和国的统治下，乡村居民们却从事于竞赛，修好堤坝并防止了灾难性的洪水。
    各村都在竞相缴纳公粮。第一个交了税的村庄就赢得了光荣。各个家庭与各个村庄都在参加遵守卫生规则的竞赛。
    这里有一个非常有趣的事实：一九四九年，在庆祝独立节（九月二日）时，胡志明主席号召人民出卖大米给军队。宣布的价钱是五越币一公斤大米，而市场上则是二十越币一公斤。为了响应胡志明主席的号召，于是便展开了争取多卖的竞赛。贫农、甚至孩子们——先锋队员们——都要求工作以便能够卖大米给军队。尽管是在青黄不接的时期，尽管为时仅两星期，但所征集的大米却超出了十万吨。
    竞赛也表现在帮助地方部队上面。例如，在绥和地区（富安省）的居民是一天之内捐助了四千二百万越币来维持地方部队，其中一部分捐的是大米和家畜。寿春区（清化省）的居民捐献出一千四百万越币。其他地区和省也募集了大笔款项。如果考虑到人民的条件的话，人们就完全可以认识得到这些巨大的努力和支持这种努力的伟大爱国主义究竟有何等的意义了。
    爱国主义竞赛也表现在志愿参军上。各个省与各省的群众团体（工、农、妇、青）都参加了这个竞赛。志愿参军的人数是这样的多，以致征募委员会的名额很快就满了。志愿人数比原订人数多出一倍，甚至两倍半。譬如，在今年头六个月里，虽然只需要二千二百三十人，而在清化——义安——河靖等省中等学校的九千二百十五名学生中，志愿参军的就有七千二百五十人。
    应当指出，住在越南的许多华侨也在积极地参加这个爱国主义竞赛。华侨工人陈文泰，就被军火作坊工会誉为最优秀的领班。富安城的华侨捐献了二十五亩土地（每亩合一公顷的十六分之一）和五万越币给地方部队。
    要是能够去掉这一运动道路上的种种困难的话，爱国主义运动是可以获得更显著的成就的。这些困难可以分为两类：外在的困难——因战争而产生的物资与交通工具的缺乏等，内在的困难——缺乏熟练的领导干部，缺少一个统筹兼顾的计划。因此，就产生了许多错误和缺点，譬如，不必要的浪费力量，形式主义的倾向，追求纪录，没有利用别人的经验等。
    但是，尽管有这些缺点，爱国主义竞赛却标志着爱国战争中的一个历史转折点。它向全体人民，特别是工人阶级表明：他们的创造天才和建设能力是无穷无尽的。它加强并巩固了人民对于胜利和对于将来的信心。
