    I.
    The Liulihe Cement Plant in Beijing completed a total output equivalent to four years and three months during the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang rule in less than eleven months. However, the production situation in these eleven months was not smooth. In the first, second, and third months, the opposition between Party members and non-Party employees (including the factory director) seriously hindered the completion of the production plan. From April onwards, this situation changed, guaranteeing the early realization of the annual plan.

    In the first three months of this year, the production efficiency of the Liulihe Cement Plant was shockingly low. January was the most serious. Cement only completed 8.28 percent of the original plan, and clinker only completed 56.8 percent. At that time, the main production machines in the factory - the large kiln and the cement mill - experienced failures. Seventeen roots of the large kiln's idler shaft were found to have wire drawing, and thirty-four pairs of bearing shells were worn and heated. The hollow shaft of No. 1 cement mill cracked, and the small gear shaft of No. 2 cement mill broke. Other electric motors and machines also had frequent failures and often stopped. However, the factory leaders did not actively find ways to solve these serious accidents, but adopted a passive attitude of "machine aging, this is inevitable."

    On the other hand, Tian Guangbi, the deputy factory director and secretary of the Party branch of the factory, was arrogant and did not consult with the factory director Peng Wangyue on matters, but handled various problems in the factory arbitrarily. Therefore, the relationship between the two was very bad. In addition, Tian Guangbi did not lead the branch to frequently study methods to guarantee production, but only focused on personnel issues, so that production did not receive strong guarantee and supervision from the Party. The same phenomenon occurred in the workshop, so workers even held meetings to discuss how to deal with communists, which seriously hindered production. Moreover, both the factory leaders and the Party leaders ignored the rationalization proposals of advanced elements. For example, when the hollow shaft of No. 1 cement mill cracked, it required more than 240 kilograms of car oil every day. The worker Zhang Chiping suggested disassembling the shaft and thoroughly repairing it, but the engineer disagreed and insisted on using methods such as patching or electric welding. As a result, repairs started on February 7 and were not completed by the end of March. However, the Party organization did not offer its own opinions on such a major matter, and thought that it was a technical issue and that the branch did not need to intervene. When Zhang Chiping's second suggestion was rejected, the branch still did not pay attention to the matter. The workers were very angry about this, and their production enthusiasm declined. Many workers sat next to the machines, staring blankly at the motionless machines in distress.

    II.
    These serious problems were later reflected to the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government. The Ministry of Heavy Industry sent an inspection team to the factory to check. And instructed the North China Kiln Industry Company to organize a work team to help the work in the factory. After in-depth investigation and research by the inspection team and the work team, they believed that to change the current situation of the factory, it was first necessary to correct the serious tendency of the Party members in the factory to be divorced from the masses, and to enable them to assume the task of uniting all the employees to complete the guarantee and supervision of production. Therefore, the branch was first mobilized to examine its own work and listen to the opinions of the workers on the Party organization. Then, a cadre symposium was held to listen to the opinions of non-Party cadres. Finally, Party members conducted self-criticism and reported at a branch meeting with mass participation. In the inspection, the bureaucratic work style of the branch leadership was strictly criticized, especially the disregard for the workers' rationalization proposals, taking an attitude of ignoring them. Then, the Party members in each workshop also conducted self-criticism at the group meetings, and invited non-Party workers to participate in giving opinions. The four Communist Party members of the mill room sincerely reviewed their mistakes: "In the past few months, the machines had frequent accidents and could not burn out the ash. When we saw that the production task was so urgent, but everyone was not nervous at all. When we went to work, we would first have a cup of tea, then smoke a cigarette, and eat a cornbread before going to the workshop. We were very angry about this, so we scolded the masses. In this way, the four of us were sometimes so busy that we didn't even have time to eat, but we still didn't do a good job." The workers were very moved after listening to these self-criticisms, and also sincerely reviewed their faults. For example, some workers said: "In the past, at meetings, only the Communist Party members spoke, and said that we were backward, so we always had one idea: let you Communist Party members say and do what you want, anyway, we are backward. Thinking about it now, this is completely wrong." In this way, the relationship between the Communist Party members and the masses began to become close. The production enthusiasm of the workers also began to increase. And at the request of all employees, several saboteurs were expelled. The leading cadres also listened to the opinions of the worker Zhang Chiping, disassembled the large shaft of No. 1 cement mill, and thoroughly repaired it.

    At the same time, various meeting systems were established, and labor discipline was formulated. The branch strengthened Party life.

    III.
    From April, production immediately exceeded the plan. At this time, the trade union also clearly put forward the orientation towards production and the development of the red flag competition movement. Communist Party members and employees unanimously responded to the call of the trade union to win the glorious red flag.

    At this time, the branch, in view of the machine situation of the factory, called on Communist Party members to unite all the workers, eliminate liability accidents, strengthen regular inspections, and create various methods to restore machine fatigue, so as to ensure the rapid development of the red flag competition movement. Each workshop established a system of regular machine inspection. After regular inspection, the operation rate of the large mill increased from 80 percent to 90 percent, and later maintained an operation rate of 85 percent. The inspection team of the motor class of the power section also inspected the operating methods, work attitude, and machine cleanliness and hygiene.

    The coal mill room has always been considered the dirtiest place, with coal dust and oil sludge everywhere. After the red flag competition movement, it became a model workshop for cleanliness and hygiene, and machine maintenance, and won the red flag twice. In the past, the large kiln switch car belts of the kiln room often had problems, and the machine had to be stopped for about 20 hours a month. In the red flag competition movement, such accidents gradually decreased, and accidents were completely eliminated by August. They not only won the red flag, but also eliminated the conservative thinking of some workers. In May and June, the factory created a new record of continuous production for 54 days, and also created a new record of frequent operation of all kilns and mills. In two months, the country saved 231,600 kilograms of millet.

    IV.
    In the past, many labor models and model Communist Party members emerged in production, but none of them were rewarded. For example, Jiang Zhongqi invented the overload signal light, which protected the turbine that the factory had for more than 30 years. The old worker Yang Xiyin transformed the large kiln switch car baffle, which protected the running belt and saved 2,850 kilograms of millet per month. The Communist Party member Zhang Yiyuan repaired No. 1 cement mill, Li Ximin repaired No. 2 cement mill, and the League member Hou Zhanlong invented the mixer, which made the kiln feeding even and reduced the downtime. The administration did not give any rewards for these creations and inventions. The branch also did not suggest to the administration. As a result, this creation and invention was not published as a mass movement. In the red flag production competition, the branch suggested that the administration should give commendation and rewards to the labor models in the movement. In this way, the production enthusiasm of the workers was even higher. In the rainy season in July, Jin De's class in the mill room created a new record of producing 10.3 tons of cement per hour, and continued for eight hours. Liu Yongjun's class created a record of producing 12.3 tons of cement per hour.

    V.
    A major overhaul was carried out in September. It was originally estimated that this overhaul would take 20 days, but the most important cement mill was repaired in seven days and production was immediately restored.

    This is because before the overhaul, the general branch had discussed and studied the overhaul plan in detail, and mobilized Party members to discuss and effectively guarantee it. During the overhaul, the general branch committee members and Communist Party members helped the administration to check the machines, find problems, and revise the overhaul plan. In addition, the branch also cooperated with the trade union to convene a forum for workers who had returned from studying at Tianjin and Beijing Staff and Workers School to encourage everyone to play an exemplary role in the overhaul. At the same time, a forum for old technical workers was convened to solicit their opinions on the overhaul work. The branches of each workshop called on Communist Party members: "As long as you can repair it yourself, you should repair it yourself." The disassembly of the large shaft in the north and south caves of the adjustment room and the replacement of the bearing shells were all repaired by the kiln branch secretary Deng Zhensheng leading all the workers.

    After the overhaul, the efficiency of the machine was improved. The power section used to have a lot of accidents, but after the major overhaul, there were no accidents for 38 days. This had never happened before. Everyone said: "The old machine has become younger, and the bad machine has become better."

    In November, during the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend the country, a patriotic production competition movement was launched. In this month alone, clinker overfulfilled by 25.06 percent, and cement overfulfilled by 18.17 percent.

    (Note) The Party organization of the factory gradually developed. In July, it was changed to a general branch, and the small groups in each workshop were changed to branches.

    琉璃河水泥厂党组织怎样保证生产的？
    培蓝    
    一
    北京琉璃河水泥厂以不到十一个月的时间，完成了相当于日伪及国民党统治时期四年零三个月的总产量。但十一个月的生产情形并不是很顺利的。在一、二、三三个月中，曾因党员与非党职工（包括厂长在内）的对立，严重地妨碍了生产计划的完成。四月份起，才改变了这种情况，保证了全年计划提前实现。
    琉璃河水泥厂在今年头三个月中，生产效率之低是惊人的。其中以一月份最为严重。水泥只完成原定计划的百分之八·二八；熟料只完成了百分之五十六·八。当时厂内主要生产机器——大窑和水泥磨都发生故障。大窑托轮轴竟有十七根拉丝，三十四对轴瓦磨损发热。一号水泥磨空心轴开裂，二号水泥磨小牙轮轴折断。其他电动等机器，也是故障百出，常常停车。可是该厂领导上对这些严重事故不是积极地想办法解决，而是采取了“机器衰老，此情难免”的消极态度。
    另一方面，副厂长兼该厂中共支部书记田光璧，自高自大，有事不和正厂长彭望钺商量，擅自处理厂内各种问题，因此双方关系很不好；另外田光璧又不领导支部经常研究保证生产的方法，而只注意于人事问题。以致生产得不到党的有力的保证与监督。在车间，同样发生此种现象，因而工人甚至开会讨论对付共产党员的办法。这样就严重地阻碍了生产。而且工厂领导干部与党的领导干部都忽视先进分子的合理化建议。例如：一号水泥磨空心轴开裂，每天就需用台车油二百四十多公斤，工人张持平建议把轴拆卸下来彻底修理一下，可是工程师不同意，偏要采用补或电焊等方法。结果从二月七日开始修理，到三月底还没有修好。但是党组织对于这样重大的事情，却不提出自己的意见，并以为这是技术问题，支部不必过问。在张持平第二次建议被驳回时，支部仍旧没有注意这件事情。工人为此非常气愤，生产情绪随之低落。许多工人坐在机器旁边，呆呆地望着不能转动的机器愁闷。
    二
    这些严重问题，后来反映到中央人民政府重工业部。重工业部即派检查组到该厂检查。并指示华北窑业公司组织了一个工作组到厂帮助工作，经过检查组、工作组深入调查研究后，认为要改变该厂现有的状况，首先要纠正厂内党员脱离群众的严重倾向，并使之担负起团结全厂职工完成保证与监督生产的任务。因此首先发动支部检查自己的工作，并听取工人群众对党组织的意见。接着又召开干部座谈会，听取非党干部意见。最后党员进行自我检讨，并在有群众参加的支部大会上作报告。在检查中严格地批评了支部领导上的官僚主义作风，特别是对工人的合理化建议熟视无睹，采取不理的态度。接着各车间的党员也在小组会上进行检讨，并邀请非党工人参加提意见。磨房股四个共产党员非常诚恳地检讨了自己的错误：“前几个月机器尽出事故，烧不出灰来。当我们看到生产任务这样紧迫，可是大家一点也不紧张。大家一上班，先喝口茶，再吸支烟，吃口窝窝头才上车间。这样我们非常生气，就骂起群众来了。这样我们四个人有时忙得连饭都来不及吃，可是工作还是没搞好。”工人们听了这些检讨后很受感动，也诚恳地检讨了自己的过失。例如有的工人说：“过去开会，因为尽是共产党员说话，并说我们落后，所以我们总拿着一个主意：任凭你们共产党员去说去作吧，反正我们是落后。现在想起来，这是完全错了。”这样，共产党员和群众的关系开始密切。工人们的生产情绪也开始提高。并在全体职工的要求下，开除了几个破坏分子。领导干部又听取了工人张持平的意见，把一号水泥磨大轴拆卸下来，彻底修理好了。
    同时，建立了各种会议制度，制定了劳动纪律。支部加强了党内生活。
    三
    从四月份起，生产马上超过了计划。工会在这时也明确提出了面向生产和开展红旗竞赛运动。共产党员和职工一致响应工会的号召，要夺取光荣的红旗。
    支部这时针对该厂机器的情况，号召共产党员要团结全体工人。消灭责任事故，加强定期检查，创造恢复机器疲劳的各种方法。以保证红旗竞赛运动迅速展开。各车间建立了定期检查机器的制度。经过定期检查后，大磨的运转率由百分之八十提高到百分之九十，以后经常保持了百分之八十五的运转率。动力股马达班支部的检查小组，还检查操作方法、劳动态度及机器清洁卫生等。
    煤磨室一向被认为是最肮脏的地方，到处是煤粉、油泥。经过红旗竞赛运动后，就成为清洁卫生、保养机器的模范车间，两次夺得红旗。窑房股的大窑开关车皮带过去常常发生毛病，每月要停车二十小时左右，在红旗竞赛运动中，这样的事故就逐渐减少，到八月份完全消灭了事故。他们不仅夺得了红旗，而且消除了某些工人的保守思想。全厂五、六月份创造了连续生产五十四天的新纪录，也创造了全部窑磨经常运转的新纪录。两个月给国家节省了二十三万一千六百斤小米。
    四
    过去在生产中涌现了许多劳动模范和模范共产党员，但都没有奖励。例如姜忠起发明了过负荷信号灯，保护了该厂已有三十多年历史的透平机。老工人杨锡银改造大窑开关车挡板，保护了运转的皮带，每月可节省小米二千八百五十斤。共产党员张义远修复了一号水泥磨，李锡民修复了二号水泥磨，团员侯占龙发明了绞拌机，使大窑下料调匀，又减少了停车时间。这些创造与发明，行政上都没有给予奖励。支部也没有向行政建议。以致这种创造发明并未发表成为群众性的运动。在红旗生产竞赛中，支部便建议行政上对运动中的劳动模范应给予表扬与奖励。这样工人的生产情绪更高。在七月雨季中，磨房靳德班，就创造了每小时生产一○·三吨水泥的新纪录，并连续八小时。刘永俊班创造出每小时生产一二·三吨水泥的纪录。
    五
    九月进行大检修。本来预计这次检修要二十天；但是其中最主要的水泥磨七天就修好了，立即恢复了生产。
    这因为检修前，总支曾详细地讨论研究了检修计划，并发动党员进行讨论，切实保证。在检修中，总支委员和共产党员都帮助行政检查机器，发现毛病，修改检修计划。另外支部又协同工会召开了从天津和北京职工学校学习回来的工人座谈会，鼓动大家在检修当中起模范作用。同时召开了老技术工人座谈会，征求他们对检修工作的意见。各车间的支部又号召共产党员：“只要自己能够修理，就应自己来修理”。调整室南北洞子里的大轴拆卸，换轴瓦，都是窑房支书邓振声带领全体工友自己修理的。
    经过检修以后，机器的效率提高了。动力股过去事故特别多，经过大检修后，三十八天没有出事故。这是从未有过的事情。大家说：“老机器变年青了，坏机器变好了。”
    十一月，在抗美援朝保家卫国运动当中，又展开了爱国主义生产竞赛运动。只这一个月，熟料超额完成了百分之二五·○六，水泥超额完成了百分之一八·一七。
    （注）该厂党组织逐渐发展，由七月份改为总支，各车间小组改为支部。
