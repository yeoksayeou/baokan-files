Xinhua News Agency, North Korea, 9th: Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, General Kim Il-sung, issued a letter to the people on the 8th regarding the liberation of Pyongyang. The full text is as follows:

    Dear citizens of Pyongyang! Dear fellow compatriots, brothers and sisters! Respected members of the People's Army and guerrilla fighters! Esteemed Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

    Under the command of the Supreme Headquarters of the People's Army, due to the fierce attacks of the heroic People's Army, the guerrillas bravely operating behind enemy lines, and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Pyongyang, the ancient capital of our country with five thousand years of history and the strong democratic base of the new People's Korea, was liberated on December 6 from the temporary occupation of the American imperialist aggressors and the traitorous Li Seung-man bandit gang.

    On the occasion of the liberation of Pyongyang, I, representing the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army, extend my boundless gratitude to the Korean People's Army, the guerrillas, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; and offer my warm congratulations to the liberated citizens of Pyongyang and all the fellow compatriots, brothers and sisters in Korea.

    Our glorious People's Army and guerrillas, hand in hand with the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, have now liberated almost all areas north of the 38th parallel, including the city of Pyongyang, and part of the southern half, pursuing the fleeing enemy and continuing to wage a major war of annihilation. Our heroic People's Guerrilla large joint forces, in every corner south of the 38th parallel, are going deep behind enemy lines, starting to strike the enemy from the rear. The United States robbers, under the so-called vicious plan of a swift victory, attempted to swallow our country's territory and conquer our country and people in one gulp, but their arrogant ambition has been shattered.

    In the recent two months of the sacred Fatherland Liberation War, our country and the sons of the people—the glorious People's Army—were forced to make a temporary strategic retreat due to the offensive of the superior forces of the imperialist aggressor armies headed by the American imperialist plunderers. However, the purpose of the temporary retreat was to launch a fierce counter-offensive against the enemy, to annihilate, sweep away, and drive out the enemy on our country's territory, and to lead the great Fatherland Liberation War to victory. The entire Korean people, who rose up to participate in the just struggle for the independence, freedom, and honor of their country, did not yield to the enemy during the extremely difficult period of retreat, but closely united around the government of the Republic, and expressed their firm determination to strive for final victory with practical actions for the sake of the country and the people. The firm determination of the entire Korean people is manifested in the solemn all-people guerrilla movement unfolded in every corner of North and South Korea temporarily occupied by the enemy, and in the extensive activities of underground people's government organs and the Workers' Party, as well as in the patriotic and devoted support of all the people for the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    The power of the people is infinite. This infinite power is ever-victorious. The entire Korean people, who have risen up to participate in the just struggle to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of their country, with the support of the great Soviet people and the Chinese people, the people of various democratic countries, and the freedom-loving people of the world, have obtained a firm belief in victory and a source of infinite strength.

    Dear officers and soldiers of the People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the guerrillas! Dear fellow compatriots, brothers and sisters! Although the enemy is retreating in disarray, they have not been completely annihilated. The enemy is still plotting a comeback in order to achieve their sinister goals. Although final victory belongs to us, we must know that there are still many difficulties on our road ahead. Only by overcoming difficulties, through cruel struggles and sacrifices, can we achieve final victory. In order to defeat the enemies of our country and strive for final victory, we must not give the retreating enemy any time to breathe, any opportunity to build new defense lines, or any time to reorganize their forces.

    To this end, our heroic People's Army should increase the speed of its offensive even more, the guerrilla units should intensify guerrilla activities in the enemy's rear south of the 38th parallel, continuously carry out surprise attacks on the enemy, and cut off their retreat routes and bridges, so that not one enemy can escape. While the enemy is retreating, they are destroying our remaining cities, villages, factories, enterprises, railway transportation, and other buildings. Our people in the liberated areas must maintain order, quickly restore the damaged areas, build houses and residences, and continuously carry out the work of stabilizing life. In order to actively support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and our People's Army, we must supply food and widely carry out the work of repairing railways, communication organs, roads, and bridges. The people in the areas yet to be liberated should annihilate any enemies found by all means, protect their cities, factories, workshops, and hometowns; and give food and all other possible assistance to the guerrilla units bravely operating in the enemy's rear, without sparing anything.

    The entire Korean people must unite more closely around the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and march towards the victorious general offensive of the Fatherland Liberation War, sending the American armed invaders and the traitorous Li Seung-man bandit gang, who have brought misfortune to our country and our people, to their graves, as they are our irreconcilable enemies.

    Glory to the glorious People's Army and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are attacking to pursue and annihilate the enemy!

    Glory to the male and female guerrilla fighters who are bravely active behind enemy lines!

    Long live the unified Korean people!

    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

    金日成将军发表告人民书
    向人民军、游击队和中国志愿部队致谢号召突破困难加速进攻争取最后的胜利
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地九日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首相、朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军，八日就平壤的解放发表告人民书，全文如下：亲爱的平壤市民们！亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！可敬的人民军队和游击队员们！敬爱的中国人民志愿部队！
    在人民军最高司令部的指挥下，由于英勇的人民军和在敌后勇敢活动的游击队以及英勇的中国人民志愿部队的猛烈攻击，我们祖国五千年历史上的古都、新的人民朝鲜的坚强的民主基地——平壤市已于十二月六日从美帝国主义侵略者与李承晚卖国匪帮的暂时侵占下获得解放了。
    当此平壤市解放之际，我代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民军最高司令部，向朝鲜人民军、游击队和中国人民志愿部队，致以无限的感谢；向解放了的平壤市民和全朝鲜的同胞兄弟姊妹，致以热烈的祝贺。
    我们光荣的人民军队和游击队与英勇的中国人民志愿部队紧紧地携着手，现在已解放了平壤市为首的三八线以北几乎全部的地区和南半部的一部分地区，向南追击仓皇逃窜的敌人，继续展开着大歼灭战。我们英勇的人民游击队的大联合部队，在三八线以南的每个角落，深入敌后，开始从后面打击敌人。美国强盗在所谓速战速决的凶恶计划下妄图一口吞并我们祖国疆土并征服我们祖国与人民，但其狂妄的野心已被粉碎。
    在神圣的祖国解放战争的最近两个月中，我们祖国与人民的儿子——光荣的人民军队，由于以美帝国主义掠夺者为首的各帝国主义侵略军优势力量的进攻，不得不暂时作战略上的退却。但是，暂时的退却的目的是予敌人以猛烈的反攻，在我们祖国的疆土上歼灭、扫荡和驱逐敌人，把伟大的祖国解放战争引向胜利。为了祖国的独立、自由荣誉而奋起参加正义斗争的全朝鲜人民，在退却的极端困难的时期中，也未向敌人屈服，而紧密地团结在共和国政府的周围，为了祖国与人民，以实际行动表示了一定要争取最后胜利的坚强决心。全朝鲜人民的坚强决心，表现在敌人暂时侵占下的南北朝鲜每一个角落所展开的庄严的全人民的游击运动，和地下人民政权机关、劳动党的广泛活动，以及全体人民对人民军队和中国人民志愿部队的那种爱国的献身的支援工作中。
    人民的力量是无穷的。这一无穷的力量是百战百胜的。为了保卫自己祖国的独立、自由、荣誉而奋起参加正义斗争的全朝鲜人民，在伟大的苏联人民和中国人民及各民主国家人民以及全世界爱好自由人民的声援下，获得了对胜利的坚强信念和无穷力量的泉源。
    亲爱的人民军官兵和中国人民志愿部队以及游击队！亲爱的同胞兄弟姊妹们！敌人虽然正在混乱地后退，但还没有被彻底歼灭。敌人仍在阴谋卷土重来，以便达成其险恶目的。最后的胜利虽然属于我们，但要知道在我们前进的道路上还有重重困难。我们只有突破困难，通过残酷的斗争和牺牲，才能取得最后的胜利。为了打败我们祖国的仇敌，争取最后的胜利，就要对后退的敌人不给与喘息的时间，不给予构筑新防御线的机会，不给与重整兵力的时间。
    为此，我们英勇的人民军队应更增加进攻的速度，游击部队在三八线以南的敌人后方要使游击活动更加积极化，接连不断地奇袭敌人，截断其退路和桥梁，以使敌人一个也逃不了。敌人一方面后退，而另一方面却在破坏着我们尚存的城市、农村、工厂、企业、铁道运输及其他建筑物。我们人民在解放地区必须维持秩序，将被破坏的地方迅速予以恢复，建筑房子和住宅，不断地进行安定生活的工作。为了积极支援中国人民志愿部队和我们人民军，必须供给食粮，广泛地展开修复铁道、通讯机关、道路、桥梁的工作。尚待解放地区的人民，应以一切方法歼灭所发现的任何敌人，保护自己的城市、工厂制作所、乡土；对于在敌后方英勇活动的游击部队，要不惜一切地给予食粮及其他一切可能的援助。
    全朝鲜人民要更紧密地团结在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的周围，要向祖国解放战争的胜利总进军，把为我们祖国和我们人民带来不幸的不共戴天之仇敌美国武装侵犯者和李承晚卖国匪帮送进坟墓去。
    光荣归于为追歼敌人而进攻的光荣的人民军和英勇的中国人民志愿部队！
    光荣归于在敌后勇敢活动的男女游击队员！
    统一的朝鲜人民万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
