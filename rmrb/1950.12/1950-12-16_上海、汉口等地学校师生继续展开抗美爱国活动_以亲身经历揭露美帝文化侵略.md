    Shanghai, Hankou and other places, school teachers and students continue to launch anti-American patriotic activities
    Exposing the U.S. imperialist cultural aggression with personal experiences

    [Xinhua News Agency News] Schools in Shanghai, Wuhan, Suzhou, Fuzhou and other places continue to launch patriotic activities to resist the United States and aid Korea.
    In Wuhan, over 4,300 faculty members and students from National Wuhan University and Central China University (founded by the American Christian Church) held rallies on the 6th of this month to denounce the crimes of U.S. imperialism. More than 30 professors from both universities who had studied in the United States used their personal experiences or witnessed facts to expose Austin's shameless lies in the Security Council, claiming that U.S. imperialism's cultural aggression against the Chinese people was "friendship."
    Lu Yu-dao and 54 other professors from Shanghai Fudan University who had studied in the United States jointly issued a declaration, exposing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism based on their personal experiences, and stated that they would continue to expose the true face of U.S. imperialism to the people of the country through oral and written propaganda.
    More than 4,000 faculty members and students from Soochow University, Tao Wu, Cui Ying and more than a dozen other missionary middle schools in Suzhou held anti-American patriotic rallies in three locations on the 8th.
    Faculty members and students from private Fujian Union University, Hwa Nan Women's College, Anglo-Chinese College, Foochow College, Tao Shu, and Yu Ying missionary schools in Fuzhou also issued declarations or gave speeches, refuting Austin's slander against the Chinese people in the Security Council. Anglo-Chinese College, Foochow College and other schools also held symposiums to denounce the crimes of U.S. imperialism.
    After recognizing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, students in various places expressed their determination to carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect their homes and defend the country with practical actions. Many students requested to join military cadre schools to master modern military knowledge and skills in order to consolidate national defense forces. Students from various schools in Fuzhou launched a campaign to write a letter of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteers who are resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and students from Fujian Provincial Medical College launched a comfort campaign of one toothbrush and one towel per person.

    各地学生在认清了美帝国主义的侵略本质后，纷纷表示要用实际行动开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动。许多学生要求参加军事干部学校，掌握现代军事知识和技能，以巩固国防力量。福州市各学校学生并发起一人写一封慰问信慰问我国人民抗美援朝志愿军的运动，福建省立医学院同学发起每人一个牙刷、一条毛巾的慰劳运动。
