    Mobilize the Masses to Stop Unlawful Landlords from Sabotaging the Land Reform
    To the Editors:
    In the land reform process in various parts of Southern Jiangsu, the unlawful and destructive activities of unscrupulous landlords have been widely discovered. I am now reporting these situations as follows, hoping that the leading organs in areas carrying out land reform will pay attention, boldly mobilize the masses, and stop the destructive activities of these unlawful landlords.
    During land registration in various parts of Southern Jiangsu, unlawful landlords concealed and dispersed their land. For example, in Gaochun County, the unlawful landlord Xu Yunjing owned a total of 109 mu of land but only reported 52 mu. Some landlords held secret meetings during the land reform to plot sabotage. For example, four landlord households in Yingxi Township, Wujin County, discussed ways to resist land reform, with some concealing land and others attempting to bribe cadres. In addition, after a meeting of six landlord households in Xin'an Township of the same county, three households falsely divided their property, one household cut down trees, and one household transferred land. Even more, some unlawful landlords created fake "land reforms." For example, the unlawful landlord Fang Qinong in Qin Huai Township, Jiangning, who owned more than 70 mu of land, kept the best 20 mu for himself and distributed the rest to the villagers. He wanted them to say, "There are no landlords in this village, so there is no need for land reform."
    During class designation, unlawful landlords cunningly denied their status, and some used distorted documents to intimidate. Xi Junliang, a landlord in Zhou Dong Township, Jiangyin, said, "The document says that a landlord must have 100 mu of self-cultivated land or 200 mu of rented land. There is only one landlord in our township." He also scared the peasants by saying, "If you designate the wrong class, you will be sued."
    During the confiscation and requisition of land for distribution, unlawful landlords resisted handing over land and other property that should be confiscated. Zhou Xiaojin in Yanfu Township, Jurong, moved away all the furniture, etc., that should have been confiscated. Zhang Jingqing, a landlord in Linqiao Township, Wuxian County, secretly transported away 35 dan of grain after being classified as a landlord. Sun Shaoliang, an unlawful landlord in Fangqian Township, Wuxi, even pulled out the field markers used to divide the land for the peasants.
    In some areas where land reform has already been carried out, unlawful landlords are constantly discovered engaging in sabotage, and their rumors have become even more rampant, especially after the American imperialists invaded Korea.
    In individual areas, reactionary landlords have been found colluding with secret societies, special agents, and bandits, attempting to organize riots and obstruct the progress of land reform. For example, Ling Baojing, a landlord in Xuxiang Village, Yuantong Township, Jurong, deliberately created disturbances at a mass meeting in the village on October 19, instigating a riot that failed. During class designation in Liwei Village, Dongtan Township, Dantu County, the reactionary landlord Wei Xinghe colluded with six bandits and killed three of our cadres and peasants.
    By mid-October, the people's courts in various counties had been successively established and were suppressing the destructive crimes of unlawful landlords by methods such as touring the countryside for trials, actively supporting the peasant movement. However, some local cadres have a very poor sense of vigilance against unlawful landlords, especially in areas where land has already been distributed. Some cadres tend to think that "everything is fine," which urgently needs to be corrected.

### 发动群众制止不法地主破坏土地改革

    发动群众制止不法地主破坏土地改革编辑同志：
    苏南各地进行土地改革中，普遍发现不法地主违法破坏行为。现将这些情况报告如后，望进行土地改革地区的领导机关加以注意，并大胆发动群众，制止不法地主的破坏行为。
    苏南各地在进行土地登记中，不法地主隐瞒、分散土地。如高淳县不法地主徐云经共有土地一百零九亩，只报出五十二亩。有些地主在土改中秘密集会，阴谋破坏。如武进瀛西乡四户地主商讨对抗土改办法，有的隐瞒土地，有的企图收买干部。另该县新安乡六户地主开会后，三户假分家，一户砍树，一户转移田亩。更有不法地主制造假“土改”的。如江宁秦淮乡不法地主方钦松，有地七十多亩，将好的二十亩留给自己，其余分给本村农民。要他们说：“本村没有地主，不要土改了。”
    划分阶级时，不法地主狡赖成份，有的则以歪曲文件来进行威吓。江阴周东乡地主袭俊良说：“文件上有，地主成份要一百亩自耕田，二百亩出租田，我们乡内只有一户地主”。并吓唬农民说：“划错了要吃官司。”
    没收、征收分配土地中，不法地主抗拒交出应予没收的土地及其他财产。句容延福乡周孝进，把应没收的家具等全部运走，吴县琳桥乡地主张净清评为地主后，偷运走三十五担谷子。无锡坊前乡不法地主孙绍良竟把农民分田标志拔去。
    某些已土改区亦不断发现不法地主破坏，特别是美帝侵朝后，不法地主散播谣言更形嚣张。
    个别地区发现反动地主勾结会门、特务、土匪、企图组织暴动，阻碍土改的进行。如句容元通乡许巷村地主凌宝经，在十月十九日该村开群众大会时，借故捣乱，煽动暴动未逞。丹徒县东贪乡李韦村划阶级时，反动地主韦兴和勾结土匪六人，杀死我干部、农民三人。
    迄十月中旬，各县人民法庭相继建立，并以下乡巡回审判等方法镇压不法地主的破坏罪行，积极支持农民运动。但某些地方干部对不法地主警惕很差，特别是已进行分配了土地的地区，部分干部思想上有“万事大吉”的倾向，亟须纠正。
