    Over Sixty University Students from Beijing and Tianjin Join the People's Navy
    Naval Political Department Holds Rally to Extend a Warm Welcome

    [Report from this newspaper] Amidst the upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea, twenty-two students (and one assistant teacher, Zhang Shigan) from Tsinghua University in Beijing, including Hu Keqiang; seventeen students from Peking University, including Li Zuoting; eleven students from Yenching University, including Tang Liben; four students from Beijing Normal University, including Qi Jiying; seven students from Beiyang University in Tianjin, including Lu Yusheng; and Zhang Wenxue from Nankai University have all voluntarily dedicated themselves to the construction of the People's Navy, shouldering the glorious task of defending the motherland's sea frontiers.

    Before the students joined the army, each university held enthusiastic farewell meetings.

    At noon on December 2nd, the Naval Political Department held a symposium to welcome the students joining the army. At the meeting, Deputy Political Commissar Liu and Minister Lei of the Organization Department, among others, expressed a warm welcome in their speeches, and elucidated the navy's military construction line, calling on the students joining the army to work hard, study diligently, and build a strong People's Navy without fear of hardship. The students joining the army thus became even clearer about the arduousness of their responsibilities, and enhanced their confidence in the inevitable victory of the People's Navy's construction. Everyone embarked on their work posts with excitement and joy.

    Of the sixty-three people joining the People's Navy this time, sixty are glorious members of the Communist Youth League.
