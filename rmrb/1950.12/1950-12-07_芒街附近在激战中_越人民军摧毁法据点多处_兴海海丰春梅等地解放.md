In November, they liberated 18 cities and towns, including Lao Cai provincial capital, Xinghai in Phu Tho province, and Haifeng northwest of Mong Cai.

After the People's Army captured Haifeng, an important French forward stronghold 16 kilometers northwest of Mong Cai, on November 10th, they attacked Mong Cai on the 11th and 12th, destroying many French peripheral strongholds. Fierce fighting is still ongoing near Mong Cai.

During the fighting in the Lao Cai area in November, the People's Army annihilated two enemy battalions, seized three tons of military supplies and five trucks. The People's Army also liberated Coc Leu and Sa Pa, a mountain resort near Lao Cai.

In Phu Tho province, under the pressure of the People's Army, the French army withdrew from Xinghai and eight other strongholds on November 2nd. In Bac Ninh and Bac Giang provinces, the People's Army destroyed five French strongholds in early November. In the Red River Delta, the People's Army drove the enemy forces out of Dong Ha, north of Son Tay provincial capital, on November 4th. In Thai Binh province, the People's Army captured the French stronghold of Dong Phu on November 15th, killing and wounding 25 enemy soldiers, and occupied another stronghold, Cao Phat (transliteration), on the 18th. In mid-November, the People's Army continuously attacked French strongholds between Ba Sa (transliteration) and Phu Ly in Ha Dong province. Under the strong pressure of the People's Army, the French army withdrew from the important stronghold of Chunmei.

In South Vietnam, the People's Army has recently launched powerful attacks against the French invading forces to coordinate with the large-scale offensive in the northern border region.
