    Li Yong Initiates "Super-Axle" Movement
    ——"Mao Zedong Locomotive" Leads Patriotic Production Campaign
    In the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend our country, Li Yong, the driver of the glorious "Mao Zedong Locomotive," was constantly pondering one thing: how to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with practical actions? After work, he would talk to his fellow workers: "The joint declaration of the various democratic parties represents our will. We must resolutely resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend our country!" At a symposium, he and the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" crew wrote a letter of determination, requesting the higher authorities: "Volunteer to go to Korea to do transportation work." He handed the letter of volunteer service to the higher authorities, requesting their approval to participate in the war in Korea. Later, he thought: "What should we do before going to Korea?" Seeing the heavy winter transportation, insufficient vehicles, and lack of manpower, and hearing Minister Teng Daiyuan's request that all railway employees across the country complete the 1950 task ahead of schedule, he put forward a rationalization proposal: "Find ways to make locomotives 'haul more and run faster' to enhance the country's transportation capacity, which is also resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and protecting our homes and defending our country." On October 21st, the Tianjin Railway Administration held a telephone conference, and Li Yong put forward the slogan of "super-axle," which was enthusiastically approved by the administration at the time.
    "Super-axle" means letting the locomotive haul more and run faster, improving transportation efficiency. This is not an easy task. In the cold winter, axles are prone to freezing, making it difficult to increase traction. If the quality of the locomotive is not good, and the crew is irresponsible and lacks skills, then not only can it not "super-axle," but it cannot even meet the axle requirement. In the past, some locomotives often fell short of the axle requirement, wasting a lot of traction. In April of this year, the national railway axle shortage reached 25 percent, and the phenomenon of damaging the country's material resources was very serious. If the "super-axle" work is done well, it can not only complete the transportation task ahead of schedule in the current busy winter transportation, but also save locomotives, shorten vehicle turnover, and greatly save national assets. Li Yong took these facts and repeatedly explained them to his fellow workers in Fengtai, using calculations to illustrate the benefits of this method: "If a locomotive hauls only 300 tons more, the Tianjin Bureau has hundreds of locomotives, and the country has thousands of locomotives, then how many tons should be hauled more! Hauling more tons can save locomotives, coal, and oil, and also save manpower, which would greatly benefit the country!"
    Li Yong explained the principle of "super-axle" clearly to the employees, but he felt that it was not enough. To do a good job in a new movement, it could not be solved by a few words, nor could it be done only by the crew. "Super-axle" had to rely on the joint efforts of all departments, including rolling stock, machinery, engineering, electricity, and inspection. So, he went to consult with other workers. He talked with Zhang Zuyao, the driver of locomotive "No. 1939" of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, and Xu Mingjiu, the driver of the "China-Soviet Friendship Locomotive," for a long time, repeatedly asking them: "What are your opinions on this suggestion? How should we do it?" They replied: "Great! We support your suggestion!" Li Yong also asked them to solicit opinions from the crew members of the entire depot. They inquired of the workers of twenty or thirty locomotives, and everyone said: "The old hero's proposal is right." Li Yong felt confident after listening to everyone's opinions, but he also thought: "The crew's opinions are consistent, but this is not enough. We have to ask for the opinions of other departments." Li Yong spared time from his busy schedule and ran to the factory several times, sincerely soliciting everyone's opinions, saying: "We are the ones who operate the locomotives. Without you repairing the locomotives well, not to mention 'super-axle,' even 'starting' would break down. We want to do 'super-axle,' and we have to work together!" The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" crew carefully checked the locomotive parts at all times, paid good attention to oiling, and maintained the locomotive in good condition to avoid repair by the repair team; and whenever they encountered any difficulties, they humbly consulted the repair team, never being arrogant. During the train run, if they discovered any problems, they would tell the repair team in detail to help them check these problems. Once, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" had difficulty generating steam, and the crew was very anxious. The repair team workers heard about it and immediately came to the locomotive and followed the crew on the run, and found the reason for the difficulty in generating steam and repaired it in time. Because of their mutual help and learning, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" repaired by the repair team never had any rework or unexpected failures.
    Old hero Li Yong visited every railway department in the Fengtai area, soliciting opinions on the one hand and calling on everyone to launch a super-axle movement on the other. The railway workers of the entire Fengtai area were all surrounding Li Yong, and they unanimously expressed to Li Yong: "Do a good job in super-axle!" The workers of the inspection section guaranteed: inspect, repair, quickly test the wind, and quickly dispatch the train with inspection and repair along the way, so that the train departs on time; no omissions in inspection, no omissions in repair, and thoroughly implement the ten-part inspection system. The workers of the traffic section said: load quickly, unload quickly, do not affect loading along the line, and do not delay the accumulation of goods. The workers of the engineering section tamped the line once and completely eliminated slow running; currently, bridges No. 30, 34, and 40, which had been running slowly for more than ten years, have all returned to normal operation. They wrote to Li Yong: "We guarantee that you will not have any accidents on our line." The telecommunications section also responded to the super-axle movement with "clear communication." Every railway worker in Fengtai was involved in the upsurge of the super-axle movement with such practical actions.
    Old hero Li Yong saw that everyone was moving, and he was even more determined to work hard and take the lead in deepening the movement. Li Yong thought: The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" has safely traveled more than 190,000 kilometers. If a crew member is slightly careless and has a small accident, the entire record of safe kilometers will be destroyed; it will lose a lot of national assets. Therefore, Li Yong emphasized to the crew members: "Safety first, and implement super-axle on the basis of safety." Crew member Yue Shangwu immediately added: "Safety first, but don't forget to run fast, this is called the principle of 'fast and steady'." In the past glorious record of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive," saving coal and oil has always been a very important achievement. In October, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" saved coal by about 20 percent. They knew that the amount of coal used by locomotives in the railway system was the largest, with locomotive coal accounting for more than 90 percent of the total railway coal consumption in the entire Northeast Railway. Therefore, Li Yong proposed: "One piece of coal, one point of strength; one drop of oil, one drop of blood; save more coal and oil, and strike more at the American devils!" Recently, the Fengtai Locomotive Depot used fine coal, which is not easy to burn and is easily blown away when put into the boiler, resulting in large waste. The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" crew came up with a method of water seepage, seeping water into the fine coal to make it congeal into lumps; but not too much water can be seeped in, because too much water is easy to freeze and even harder to burn. The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" led by Li Yong launched a super-axle movement under the principles of safety, punctuality, and economy. On November 17th, the sun shone brightly on the "Mao Zedong Locomotive." Li Yong skillfully turned on the steam valve, blew the whistle, and pulled a train of 55 cars more than a mile long from Tianjin to Fengtai. Thousands of people standing at the Fengtai Station saw a long plume of white smoke rolling in from afar. The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" appeared in front of the welcoming crowd amid the sound of gongs and drums. Students from Tsinghua University lifted Li Yong high and presented him with a red flag: "Winning victories on the production front, truly a hero in defending the country." In this run, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" exceeded the axle requirement by 377 tons, saved more than 500 kilograms of coal, and achieved "safety" and "punctuality." From that day on, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" has maintained this record and galloped between Tianjin and Fengtai, having exceeded the axle requirement by more than 3,000 tons and is about to reach 200,000 safe kilometers.
    "We must learn from Li Yong and learn from the 'Mao Zedong Locomotive'." Liu Yingcai, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Railway Administration, called on all railway employees to follow Li Yong and strive for super-axle. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions called on railway workers across the country: "Arise! Respond to the call of labor model Comrade Li Yong, launch a super-axle movement, and ensure the completion of transportation tasks." This resounding call was wholeheartedly responded to by railway workers across the country. From Changbai Mountain to the Pearl River Basin, from the Northwest Plateau to the Southeast Coast, the voices of railway workers demanding super-axle could be heard everywhere. One-third of the locomotives at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot have exceeded the axle requirement. Locomotive "No. 1939" has exceeded the axle requirement by 549 tons. The total safe running kilometers of the entire depot has exceeded 800,000. The total super-axle of the entire depot has reached 6,000 tons, fundamentally changing the phenomenon of insufficient locomotive manpower. The number of locomotives exceeding the axle requirement in Baoding, Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Xi'an, Shanghai, and Northeast China is increasing day by day. Their common slogan is: "Haul more and run faster, drive away the American imperialist aggressors!"

    李永发起的超轴运动
    ——“毛泽东号”带头掀起爱国生产运动
    在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，光荣的“毛泽东号”机车司机长李永天天在琢磨着一件事：怎样以实际行动支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队？他下班后，就找工友们谈：“各民主党派的联合宣言代表了咱们的意志，咱们要坚决抗美援朝保家卫国！”在一个座谈会上，他和“毛泽东号”乘务员写下了决心书，向上级要求：“志愿到朝鲜去，做运输工作。”他把志愿书交给了上级，请求上级批准他们到朝鲜去参战。后来他又想：“没到朝鲜去以前，怎么办呢？”他看到冬季运输繁忙，车辆不足，人手不够，又听到滕代远部长要求全国铁路员工提前完成一九五○年任务，于是他提出一个合理化建议：“设法使机车‘多拉快跑’，增强国家的运输力量，也就是抗美援朝保家卫国。”十月二十一日，天津铁路管理局举行电话会议，李永提出了“超轴”的口号，当时得到了行政上热烈的赞成。
    “超轴”就是要让机车多拉快跑，提高运输效能。这不是一件容易的工作。冬季天寒地冻，轴容易凝，不易增加牵引力量。如果机车质量不好，乘务员不负责、技能差，那就不仅不能“超轴”，而且还满不了轴。过去有些机车经常欠轴，大量地浪费牵引力。今年四月份全国铁路欠轴竟达百分之二十五，损害国家物力的现象是很严重的。“超轴”工作如果作得好，不仅能在目前冬运繁忙的情况下，能够提前完成运输任务，而且可以节省机车，缩短车辆周转率，大大节省国家资财。李永拿这些事实，在丰台反复向工友们解释，用算账的方式说明这个办法的好处：“一台机车如果只多拉三百吨，天津局有几百台机车，全国有几千台机车，那么该多拉多少吨！多拉了吨数，既能节省机车和煤、油，而且也能省人力，这对国家该有多大的好处！”
    李永把“超轴”的道理，给员工们讲清楚了，他觉得还不行，要搞好一个新运动，决不是几句话能解决问题的，也不光有乘务员干就成，“超轴”得依靠车、机、工、电、检各部门同心协力一起干才成。于是他就去找其他工友商量，他和丰台机务段“一九三九号”机车司机长张祖耀、“中苏友好号”机车司机长许鸣九谈了好久，再三地问他们：“对这个建议有啥意见？怎个办？”他们回答：“好极了！咱们拥护你这个建议！”李永又请他们向全段的包乘组的工友们征求意见，他们询问了二三十台机车的工友，大伙都表示：“老英雄提得对。”李永听了大家的意见，心里有了底，但是他又想：“乘务员的意见一致了，这还不成，得问问别的部门的意见怎么样。”李永在百忙中，抽出时间，几次跑到工厂去，诚恳地征询大家的意见说：“咱们搞机车的，没有你们修好机车，那不用说‘超轴’，就连‘开动’也垮啦。咱们想搞‘超轴’，非得大家共同作不可！”“毛泽东号”的乘务员时时刻刻细心检查机车零件，很好地注意上油，保持机车良好状态，以免包修组虽以修理；并且碰到什么困难，他们就虚心的请教包修组，从不骄傲。在出乘当中，发现怎样的毛病，就详细地告诉包修组，帮助包修组检查这些毛病。有一次，“毛泽东号”机车不好烧汽，乘务员很着急，包修组工友听了，马上就来到机车上，跟着乘务员跑车，遂发现不好烧汽的原因，及时修好。由于他们这样互相帮助和学习，经过包修组修理的“毛泽东号”，从未反工，从未发生意外的故障。
    老英雄李永拜访了丰台地区的每个铁路部门，一面征求意见。一面号召大家展开超轴运动，整个丰台的铁路工人们都围绕在李永的周围，他们一致向李永表示：“搞好超轴！”检车段的工友保证：随编、随检、随修、快试风、快发车，使列车正点开出；不漏检、不漏修、彻底实行十部检查制。车务段的工友说：快装、快卸、不影响沿线装车，不延积货物。工务段的工友将线路捣固一次，完全消灭徐行；目前，徐行了十几年的三○、三四、四○号桥都已恢复正常行驶。他们写信给李永：“保障你在我们线上不出事故。”电务段也以“通话清晰”，响应超轴运动。全丰台的每个铁路工人，就以这样的实际行动卷入了超轴运动的热潮里。
    老英雄李永看见大伙儿都动起来，更下决心要埋头苦干，带头把运动深入展开。李永心里想：“毛泽东号”已经安全走行了十九万多公里，如果有一个乘务员稍不小心，出一个小事故，全部安全公里的纪录就要毁掉；就会损失国家大量资财。因此，李永对乘务员们强调指出：“安全第一，在安全基础上实行超轴。”乘务员岳尚武马上补充说：“安全第一，还不要忘了快跑，这叫做‘快而稳’的方针。”在“毛泽东号”以往的光荣纪录里，节约煤、油，始终是一项极重要的成绩。十月份，“毛泽东号”省煤经常在百分之二十左右。他们知道在铁路系统中机车用煤的数量最大，全东北铁路机务用煤占整个铁路用煤百分之九十以上。因此，李永提出：“一块煤，一分力；一滴油，一滴血；多省煤和油，多打击美国鬼子！”最近丰台机务段用的是末煤，末煤不好烧，放进锅炉容易飞掉，浪费大。“毛泽东号”乘务员想出渗水的办法，把水渗进末煤里，使它凝成块型；但是水又不能渗多，渗多了，容易冻，更不好烧。李永领导的“毛泽东号”机车，就在安全、正点和节约的原则下，展开了超轴运动。十一月十七日，太阳光辉地直射在“毛泽东号”机车身上，李永熟练地攀开汽门，吹动汽笛，拖着一里多长的五十五辆列车，从天津驶向丰台。伫立在丰台车站的上千群众，遥远地看见一条漫长的白烟滚来。“毛泽东号”在锣鼓声中出现在欢迎的人群前面。从清华大学赶来的学生们，把李永高抬起来，送给他一面红旗：“生产战线打胜仗，保家卫国真英雄。”“毛泽东号”在这一次运行里超轴三百七十七吨，省煤五百多公斤，而且做到了“安全”和“正点”。从这一天起，“毛泽东号”一直保持这个纪录骋驰在天津丰台间，已共计超轴三千多吨，即将达到二十万安全公里。
    “咱们要学习李永，学习‘毛泽东号’。”天津铁路管理局刘英才副局长号召全路员工跟着李永走，争取超轴。中华全国总工会向全国铁路工人们号召：“起来！响应劳动模范李永同志的号召，展开超轴运动，保证运输任务的完成。”这一响亮的号召得到全国铁路工人的衷心响应，从长白山到珠江流域，由西北高原至东南沿海，到处可以听到铁路工人们要求超轴的声音。丰台机务段已有三分之一的机车超轴了，“一九三九号”机车曾超轴五百四十九吨，全段安全走行公里已超过八十万，全段超轴已达六千吨，根本改变了机车人力不足的现象。保定、北京、天津、济南、西安、上海和东北等地的机车超轴数目逐日增多，他们的共同口号就是：“多拉快跑，赶走美帝侵略军！”
