Xinhua News Agency dispatch: People from all walks of life in various regions resolutely oppose the US government's conspiracy, as expressed in its memorandum to the Soviet Union, to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan, and unanimously support the Soviet Union's solemn position in its memorandum to the United States on this issue.

The Trade Union Council of Jilin Province, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and six other people's organizations jointly issued a statement saying: The US government's memorandum to the Soviet Union and its unauthorized release of Japanese Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru fully demonstrate that the US government is fostering Japanese fascist forces in order to use them to re-invade our country. The statement expressed full support for Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement and firmly advocated the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. The Trade Union Council of Liaoxi Province, the Women's Federation, and three other people's organizations unanimously stated in a statement: We will resolutely take practical action to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country to shatter the US imperialist aggressive schemes. Yang Taiji, a farmer in the suburbs of Jinzhou who had his uncle buried alive and his father injured by Japanese bandits, said: I will not forget the hatred of the past. Today, US imperialism is determined to prop up the Japanese devils to slaughter us again, and I will resolutely not allow it! The people of Rehe Province, who suffered thirteen years of trampling by Japanese bandits, have written to the Rehe Daily, expressing that they cannot tolerate the US imperialists' evil actions of fostering the resurgence of Japanese aggression forces.

The Preparatory Committee of the Central South China Trade Union Council and the Wuhan City Trade Union Council unanimously pointed out in written opinions: The US government's intention in proposing this memorandum is to attempt to exclude the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union and conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan; it is a conspiracy to arm Japan and turn Japan into a base for US imperialism to invade China and the Soviet Union. The written opinion firmly stated: All workers in Central South China and Wuhan City vow to oppose this arrogant conspiracy of the US government with practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. Local organizations of democratic parties in Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, as well as people's organizations such as workers, farmers, students, and women, and the industrial and commercial circles in the two provinces, all unanimously condemned the US government's despicable attempt to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and firmly advocated the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan.

The workers and families of martyrs of the Xiaguan Power Plant, who suffered cruel massacres by Japanese bandits, resolutely opposed MacArthur's unauthorized release of Japanese war criminals and the illegal act of fostering the revival of Japanese aggression forces. Sun Youfa, who escaped from the Japanese bandits' knives, Quan Defa, a worker whose father was killed, and young worker Jin Fushun, as well as old workers Cui Shengfu, Tang Ruzhang, and Gu A'jin, who narrowly escaped death under the Japanese devils' knives, recounted the crimes of the Japanese bandits' massacre of the people of Nanjing and their own relatives in 1937 with extreme anger and determination for revenge. The workers pointed to the scars on their bodies and angrily said: US imperialism has released Japanese war criminals, and this blood debt must be repaid by US imperialism. The people's organizations in the Southern Anhui region of East China issued a joint statement pointing out: The heroic Soviet Union and the Chinese people are the main forces in defeating Japanese fascism. The US government's attempt to abandon China and the Soviet Union and conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan is an illegal act, which we Chinese people can never tolerate. People's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City have also issued statements protesting the US imperialist conspiracy.

People of all ethnic groups in Ningxia and Gansu provinces and Lanzhou City in the Northwest region have successively made speeches protesting against the US government's illegal acts of attempting to conclude a separate peace treaty with Japan and releasing Japanese Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru. The Gansu Provincial Hui Nationality Education Promotion Association issued a written statement saying: We have already recognized that the American robbers are the deadly enemies of the people of all ethnic groups in China. We Hui people must fight this demon with all our strength.

The Chongqing Xinhua Daily published a commentary warning US imperialism, saying: The Chinese people have the right to speak on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Whoever violates the will of the Chinese people will receive the punishment they deserve.
