    Park Heon-young Issues Statement
    Accusing the US-Lee Clique of Atrocities
    15,000 Residents Massacred in Gangwon Province Alone
    [Xinhua News Agency, North Korea, 15th] According to TASS, Park Heon-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement on the 12th to the heads of foreign embassies and legations regarding the brutal extermination of the Korean people and the barbaric destruction of Korean cities and villages by the US-Lee clique.
    The statement pointed out: When the US-British invading forces and the Syngman Rhee group, bought with money, retreated southward under the blows of the Korean People's Army, they deliberately massacred large numbers of Labor Party members, families of People's Army soldiers, and all peaceful residents who sympathized with the People's Democratic Government. According to extremely incomplete data, more than 15,000 peaceful residents have been shot and killed in Gangwon Province alone. In a small village in Oktang-ri (transliterated) in Pyonggang County in the province, thirty-two families of People's Army soldiers were shot and killed, including pregnant women and children. At the same time, the defeated soldiers of the American invaders set fire to towns and villages during their retreat, and blew up and destroyed all larger houses and public buildings.
    The statement concluded by urging the heads of foreign embassies and legations to report these heinous atrocities and the barbaric extermination of peaceful Korean residents to their respective governments and world public opinion, and hoped that the governments would submit a proposal to the United Nations to immediately end these crimes that have long been denounced by all progressive mankind, and to bring the criminals to justice.

    朴宪永发表声明            
    控诉美李匪帮暴行            
    仅江原道就有万五千居民被屠杀
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社朝鲜北部讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，于十二日向各外国大使馆及公使馆首长发表关于美、李匪帮残暴地灭绝朝鲜人民和野蛮地破坏朝鲜城市与乡村的声明。
    该声明指出：美英侵略军及其用金钱收买的李承晚集团在朝鲜人民军打击下向南撤退时，蓄意大批地灭绝劳动党党员、人民军军人家属以及一切同情人民民主政府的和平居民。据极不完全的材料，仅在江原道就有一万五千余名和平居民已被枪毙。在该道平康县玉塘里（译音）的一个小村庄内，就有三十二家人民军的家属被枪毙，其中包括孕妇和小孩。同时，美国侵略者的败兵在退却时并纵火焚烧城镇和乡村，炸毁和破坏一切较大的房屋和公共建筑物。
    声明最后敦请各外国大使馆及公使馆首长把这种罪恶滔天的暴行和野蛮灭绝朝鲜和平居民的事实，转告各国政府和世界舆论，并希望各国政府向联合国提出立即终止这种在很久以来就为全体进步人类所痛斥的罪行，并追究罪犯。
