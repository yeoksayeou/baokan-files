    Beijing Middle and Primary School Teachers, After Anti-American Propaganda, Universally Establish Hatred of American Imperialist Thought
    500+ Educators in the Second District Hold Victory Parade
    [Reported by this newspaper] In the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country" propaganda movement, Beijing's middle and primary school teachers, through universal current affairs study and active participation in various activities alongside students under the leadership of the trade union, have mostly established a hatred of American imperialist thought, improved themselves, and helped the students.
    After the students launched the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the teachers and staff of various schools actively participated in current affairs study under the call of the trade union. Through forums, discussion meetings, and accusation meetings, they furthered their understanding of American imperialism. Accusation meetings of primary school teachers were held in various districts within the city. They recounted with deep sorrow the atrocities they had witnessed and personally suffered under American imperialism, as well as the pain they endured under Japanese imperialism and Kuomintang rule. At the accusation meeting at the Eighth Middle School, the teachers and staff, after hearing the accusations of students and colleagues about the crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism, wept bitterly and unanimously vowed to resolutely oppose American aggression, forever follow Chairman Mao, and be prepared to dedicate themselves to the motherland at any time. A female mathematics teacher said indignantly that, if necessary, she could abandon her only beloved child to dedicate herself to the motherland, because she realized that a child without a country is more miserable than a child without a mother. Teachers and staff who had previously been unconcerned about current affairs now felt a pressing need to study them. They opened "Teacher Study Rooms," and many people subscribed to the People's Daily and carried newspapers and current affairs manuals with them at all times, discussing current affairs during chats. The teachers of the Third Girls' Middle School even organized collective newspaper reading. More than half of the middle school teachers also participated in propaganda work. Many teachers developed their enthusiasm and creativity in propaganda work, and many model workers emerged. Many teachers began to experience the meaning of collective life. Class teachers of various classes in the Fourth Middle School actively participated in and helped the students to carry out study and propaganda work, and won the love of the students. For example, when the students went to the countryside for propaganda, Mr. Su, the class teacher of the senior third grade, also went. He said, "My accent is not good, I can't give speeches, and I can't act, but I can be a cook and make food for everyone!" So he went out every day to collect firewood, carry water, and cook for the students, letting them eat their fill before eating himself, which moved the students to call him "Combat Mama." In his spare time, he also helped the villagers with their work. An old woman said with great emotion, "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can there be such a teacher!" In many schools, language teachers took the initiative to help students collect and organize materials and create anti-American and aid-Korea poems, clappertraps, skits, and speeches; history and geography teachers promptly lectured on the history of American imperialist aggression against China, analyzed the geography of the United States, Korea, the Soviet Union, and Northeast China, and the situation of the Korean War; music teachers wrote and sang anti-American and aid-Korea songs; and art teachers created cartoons and propaganda posters. At Yu Ying Middle School, dozens of teachers and seven or eight hundred students collected materials together, and the students made creations in a very short time that surprised the teachers.
    In addition, all 500+ educators in the Second District held a victory parade on December 12th after hearing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang. During the parade, even the white-haired Principal Sun of the Second Affiliated Elementary School insisted on participating in the parade.

    京市中小学教员经过抗美宣传
    普遍树立仇视美帝思想
    二区小学教育工作者五百余人举行祝捷游行
    【本报讯】京市中小学教职员在“抗美援朝保家卫国”的宣传运动中，经过普遍的时事学习和在工会领导下积极配合同学参加了各项活动，大都树立了仇视美帝的思想，提高了自己，也帮助了同学。
    在同学们掀起了抗美援朝的运动后，各校的教职员即在工会号召下积极参加时事学习，通过座谈会、讨论会和控诉会等方式，进一步的认识美帝。城内各区都举行了小学教师的控诉会。他们沉痛地陈诉出过去自己见到和亲身受到美帝的暴行，与在日本帝国主义和国民党统治时代身受的痛苦。在八中的控诉会上，教职员们听了同学们和同仁们对国民党反动派和美帝国主义罪行的控诉，都痛哭流涕，一致宣誓，表示坚决反对美国侵略，永远跟着毛主席走，并准备随时献身祖国。一位教数学的女教员愤慨地说，必要时她可以丢下她唯一心爱的孩子献身祖国，因为她认识到没有祖国的孩子比没有妈妈更痛苦。过去一向不关心时事的教职员，现在也对时事学习感到迫切的需要，他们开辟了“教员学习室”，许多人自己订了人民日报，手里随时拿着报纸和时事手册，聊天时就谈时事。女三中的教员并组织集体读报。还有一半以上的中学教员都参加了宣传工作，许多教员并在宣传中，发挥了工作的积极性与创造性，涌现出许多模范工作者。不少教师开始体验到集体生活的意义。四中各班班主任积极参加并帮助了同学展开学习和宣传工作，获得了同学的爱戴。如同学下乡宣传时，高三的班主任苏先生也去了，他说：“我的口音不好不会讲演，也不会演戏，但是我可以当伙夫，让我替大伙儿作饭罢！”于是他每天出去打柴，挑水，给同学作饭，让同学们吃饱了自己再吃，感动得同学们称他为“战斗妈妈”。闲时还帮老乡干活，一位老太太异常感动地说：“只有在共产党领导下才会有这样的先生！”很多学校中，语文教员主动地帮助同学搜集整理材料，创作抗美援朝的诗歌、快板、活报剧、讲演辞等；史地教员及时地讲美帝侵华史，分析美国、朝鲜、苏联及我国东北的地理，及朝鲜战争形势；音乐教员写作和演唱抗美援朝的歌曲；图画教员创作了漫画和宣传画。在育英中学，几十位教师和七、八百个同学一起搜集材料，而同学们在很短时间就作出使教师们惊讶的创造。
    又，二区小学教育工作者全体五百余人，在听到平壤解放的消息后，曾于十二月十二日举行了祝捷游行，在游行中，连白发苍苍的二附小孙校长也坚持参加了游行队伍。
