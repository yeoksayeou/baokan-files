　　First of all, I want to say what I am thinking now. I thought of that very cold winter of 1946 for the Chinese people. At that time, I went to the Northeast battlefield for the first time. When I rushed into an enemy-occupied village that had just been captured, the village was still smoking. I saw a pile of green shells with U.S.A. written on them. Frankly, what my eyes saw at that time was not American shells, but the blood and lives of the Chinese people, the blood and lives of my comrades. Today, what reminds me of this is a photo in my hand. This is the first photo sent to me from the sacred border of our motherland recently. The photo tells me: a blaze soars into the sky over the Yalu River. In the Liberation War, I was almost killed three times by the planes and bombs of American imperialism. I deeply know—the madness of the plane diving, the hateful sound of the bomb whistling, and I will always remember the anger, hatred, and infinite contempt in my heart.

　　This is not a simple association. In fact, yesterday and today, American imperialism is still continuing the massacre with massacre, continuing the bloodiness with bloodiness, and continuing the fire with fire. The bullets that hit the chests of Korean brothers today are the bullets that hit the chests of the Chinese people yesterday; the bombs that killed Korean babies today are the bombs that killed Chinese babies yesterday.

　　In short, we know who is committing crimes and who is killing our people in this world.

　　The relationship between the Chinese and Korean people is inseparable. This is not an abstract theory, but a bloody reality. I can use the facts in my own life to illustrate this relationship. It was in a war that I went to the front along the Songhua River from Jilin, and I met a Korean old man named Xu Xijin. The following is my record left in the autumn of 1948:

　　"…The Korean landlord is pestling rice to make Mid-Autumn Festival rations. The wall is covered with red peppers. There is a twelve- or thirteen-year-old Korean girl named Ba Wu, wearing a yellow shirt and a white skirt, who often comes to this house to dance and sing with several children on the kang.

　　"Suddenly, an old Korean man in his fifties came in. He was very thin and had a black beard. He was particularly cordial when he saw us. After greeting us, he told me that his name was Xu Xijin. We sat by the window and talked slowly.

　　"He has six sons, and the two eldest have joined the army. He only told me about his second son, Xu Yunqi. I could see from his words how much he loved Yunqi. He said that Yunqi was just twenty years old, tall and strong. He repeatedly and quietly told me: 'He is really a good person, everyone says he is good.' Xu Yunqi was a correspondent for Wang, the political commissar of the district committee. Every time he came home, he carried a big gun on his back and a Mauser pistol, just like a soldier. Xu Xijin's eyes narrowed into a slit when he said this. But Yunqi died in the cruel struggle in Jiangxi along the Ershijiazi.

　　"He said that he died very heroically. He was tied to a tree by the Kuomintang reactionaries and stabbed to death with bayonets. He kept scolding them. Political Commissar Wang resisted and retreated to the reeds by the river. Even after he died, he sat on the snow, staring, holding a Mauser pistol in one hand.

　　"When I asked about the cause of this tragedy, it turned out that they were doing mass work in the newly liberated area and were suddenly attacked by the enemy. I understood the situation of the struggle in the upper reaches of the Songhua River at that time. It was not others who attacked the people in the liberated areas, but the reactionary landlord armed forces in this area, which were organized by Liang Huasheng of Jilin into the special agent organizations of the "Loyal and Brave Team" and "Huasheng Team". Xu Xijin said that after the tragedy happened, the people along the river were furious. Xu Yunqi's body was moved back and placed in the yard. Xu Yunqi would rather die than submit, and was stabbed six or seven times all over his body. He was as stiff as an iron bar and could not fit into the coffin. Since then, Xu Yunqi's mother—a kind old woman with white hair—misses her son every day and often wakes up crying from her dreams, saying that she dreamed of Yunqi and that Yunqi said that he was frozen to death. I looked at the vast floating river outside the window, and infinite hatred rose in my heart.

　　"Xu Xijin left for something and did not return until dusk. He sat next to me again. I comforted him, but he said:

　　"'Comrade! Can revolution be afraid of this?'

　　"I saw the fire of anger in the old man's eyes. He continued:

　　"'In the future, those who can hold guns will join the army and avenge his brother.' He touched the clothes on his body and said: 'These are still Yunqi's clothes!' I saw that it was a short jacket made of semi-old plaid blankets."

　　From one of these millions of facts, we can see the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. This friendship is combined in a clear goal, that is, the liberation, peace, and freedom of the Chinese and Korean peoples, and more specifically, so that our children can laugh freely and grow freely. Since those difficult days of war—the Chinese and Korean people have won this victory and liberation, and we are also building our today's peace and future happiness. People who have experienced years of war know best how lovely peace is.

　　We have never harmed others for our own freedom. We are only fighting for the rights of our people, so that our children can laugh freely and grow freely. The road of history is not smooth. We know how much our price has been paid, and we also know how much blood debt American imperialism owes us.

　　Our people's history is full of heroic breath. We can list countless heroic sons and daughters, such as Dong Cunrui and Liu Hulan. Such heroic sons and daughters also exist among the Korean people. At a rally of Beijing literary workers to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, I heard a passage from the Korean writer Han Xueye, which deeply moved me. He said that on the Korean battlefield, once, a North Korean soldier was seriously injured while charging the enemy's position and fell in front of the two armies. He discovered that this was a minefield. But at this time, his tank unit was driving towards this dangerous area—he waved, he shouted, but they couldn't hear him. He was anxious. In order to protect the tanks and comrades of the motherland, he used his last strength to pounce on the landmine. He sacrificed himself as the landmine exploded. This warned the tank unit of the motherland, and they changed direction and then rushed towards the enemy. I was very moved when I heard this, because I knew that this unknown Korean hero was protecting not just one or more tanks with his whole life, but the land and people of Korea. But I want to say that he is also protecting the peace and security of the Chinese people at the same time. Why can I say this?——Because the villages burned down by American shells have not yet been restored, the people handcuffed by American handcuffs can still speak, the children of the people killed by American bullets have not yet grown up, the scars broken by American bullets have not yet healed…Everyone remembers that not long ago, American imperialism invaded China and left countless filthy crimes in China. Now they are just coming to us from another path——We, the victorious Chinese people, clearly know that they are coming to us. Just as Hitler could only take Napoleon's old road, American imperialism is now taking the old road of Japanese imperialism, invading our Yalu River from Korea. At the same time, we should also know that this unknown hero in the minefield on the Korean battlefield is also protecting the peace of the world. Because, if there is no such resolute blow against the aggressors in Korea, MacArthur will be even more crazy, and he will repeat Hitler's demonic behavior even more.

　　The heroic behavior of our Chinese people volunteering to support the Korean people is our answer to American imperialism, our oath to the motherland, and our oath to world peace.

　　Recently, MacArthur has been complaining about the "uninhabited barren mountains, the snow all over the sky, and the temperature of more than 20 degrees below zero." But no one from New York asked them to come to these barren mountains except for their imperialist crazy aggression. In fact, what is in North Korea is by no means just a barren mountain and snow, but a fiery enthusiasm—this is the fighting flame of the Chinese people volunteering to aid Korea and the Korean people. The one who really feels cold is MacArthur, because what has befallen him in North Korea is not just the winter of nature. The winter of his fate has also begun. History has long proved that there is only one direction for the aggressors—that is, failure and destruction.

　　Our Chinese people's voluntary act of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is 100% correct. Because, no one will forget October 1st just a year ago, no one will forget when the first five-star red flag was raised in the free sky of the motherland by Chairman Mao himself, everyone will sincerely shed tears of excitement, and no one will forget that at that moment, we can sincerely and freely comfort our ancestors, our companions, and our children…In short, we love our victory, so we must defend our victory, and we love our peace, so we must defend our peace. When the American imperialists once again burn the flames of war towards us, volunteering to support Korea is equivalent to supporting our own motherland, which is equivalent to supporting ourselves, which is equivalent to supporting our own children's right to laugh freely and grow freely. Not only today, but our Chinese people must also swear that we will always support justice and truth, always oppose American imperialists, oppose their aggression against the people, and oppose their destruction of culture.

　　Determined people are always looking at tomorrow. I should also say a few words about tomorrow. I want to say that the Chinese and Korean people in battle are not the last time to cooperate, and our close cooperation will also appear in the court for trying American imperialist war criminals. The people who have fought for peace have already arranged a glorious trial in history—that was in Nuremberg. Where is the second one? Future history will answer this solemn question. Truman, MacArthur, Acheson, and the like are stepping up the creation of their own criminal evidence. There is already a lot of criminal evidence of American imperialism, and it is time to sort out the trial materials. We must especially remember MacArthur's invasion route, and we must bring this route map to the court of justice, because it is stained with the blood of the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the persecuted people all over the world. One day, the blood of the people will use unparalleled eloquence to accuse their crimes.

### 对祖国宣誓，对世界和平宣誓

专栏：

    对祖国宣誓，对世界和平宣誓
    刘白羽
    我首先要讲出我现在想的是什么。我想到一九四六年中国人民很寒冷的那个冬季。那个时候我第一次走上东北战场，当我奔进一个刚刚攻克的敌占村庄，村庄还在冒烟，我看见一堆绿色的炮弹，上面写着Ｕ·Ｓ·Ａ，老实讲，当时我眼睛看到的不是美国炮弹，而是中国人民的鲜血与生命，是我的同志的鲜血与生命。今天，使我想起这个来，是我手上的一张照片。这是最近从我们祖国神圣的边境上寄到我手里来的第一张照片。照片告诉我：鸭绿江上一片火焰冲天。在解放战争中，我是三次几乎给美帝国主义的飞机炸弹致于死命的人，我深知——那飞机俯冲的疯狂，炸弹啸声的可憎，我也永远记得我心胸中的愤怒、仇恨与无限的卑视。
    这不是一种简单的联想。事实上，昨天和今天，美帝国主义同样用屠杀继续着屠杀，用血腥继续着血腥，用火继续着火。今天打在朝鲜兄弟胸膛上的子弹，就是昨天打在中国人民胸膛上的子弹；今天炸死朝鲜婴儿的炸弹，就是昨天炸死中国婴儿的炸弹。
    总之，我们知道在这个世界里，是谁在犯罪，是谁在杀害我们的人民。
    我们中国人民和朝鲜人民的关系是分不开的，这不是抽象的理论，这是血肉的现实。我就可以用我自己生活中的事实来说明这种关系。那是在一次战争中，我从吉林顺着松花江上前方，我遇见一个朝鲜老人许希晋的事情。这下面就是我一九四八年秋天留下的记载：
    “……房主人朝鲜人在杵稻米，制中秋节的干粮，墙上挂着满满一墙红辣椒，有一个十二三岁的朝鲜女孩，叫芭乌，穿着黄衫白裙，常常到这屋来跟几个孩子在炕上跳着，唱着。
    “突然进来一位五十几岁的朝鲜老人，清瘦得很，留有一部黑胡须，他瞧见我们特别亲热，寒暄之后，他告诉我他姓许名希晋。我们就坐在窗前缓缓谈起来。
    “他有六个儿子，两个大的都参军去了。他单单跟我讲他二儿子许云起的事情，我从言谈之间看得出他是多么爱云起。他说云起刚满二十岁，高大结实。他反复的悄悄的告诉我：‘人真好，那里都说他好。’许云起跟区委的王政委当通讯员，他每次回家，身上背一支大枪，还带一把匣橹子，真像个军人，许希晋说到这里两眼笑得眯起一条缝。可是云起在江西沿二十家子那次残酷斗争中牺牲了。
    “他说他牺牲得非常英勇，被国民党反动派捆在树上，用刺刀戳死，他还破口大骂。王政委一面抵抗一面退到江边草塘里，死了还坐在雪地上，瞪着眼，一手端着一支匣枪。
    “我问起这惨案发生的原因，原来是到新解放区做群众工作，突然遭受了敌人的袭击。我了解当时松花江上游边沿区斗争情形，袭击解放区人民的不是别人，就是这一带反动地主武装，被吉林的梁华盛编为“忠勇队”“华盛队”的特务组织。许希晋说惨案发生以后，沿江的人都震怒了。许云起的遗体搬回来，就放在院里。许云起宁死不屈，浑身被戳了六七刀，冻得铁棒子一样直挺挺的，棺材都放不进去。从此许云起的母亲——一个和善的一头白发的老太太，天天想念儿子，常常从梦中哭醒，说梦见云起，云起说自己是冻死的。我望着窗外白茫茫的漂河，心中浮起无限仇恨。
    “许希晋有事走了，黄昏才回来，又坐在我身边。我安慰他，他却说：
    “‘同志！革命还能怕这个。’
    “我看见这个老人眼中的怒火。他继续说：
    “‘往后，能拿枪的就去当兵，给他哥哥报仇。’他摸着自己身上的衣服说：‘这还是云起的衣服呢！’我看那是用半旧花格毛毯缝制的短褂子。”
    从这千百万件当中一件事实可以看出中、朝两国人民兄弟的友谊，这种友谊结合在一个鲜明的目标里面，那就是中、朝两国人民的解放、和平与自由，更具体说，就是为了我们的儿女能自由的笑，自由的生长。自从那些艰难战争的日月以来——中国人民与朝鲜人民获得了这种胜利与解放，我们也在建设我们今日的和平与未来的幸福。经历过长年战争的人是最懂得和平的可爱。
    我们并不曾为了自己的自由而去侵害过别人，我们只是为了我们的人民的权利，为了我们的儿女能自由的笑，自由的生长。历史的道路是不平坦的，我们知道我们的代价已经付出多少，我们也知道美帝国主义已经欠了我们多少血债。
    在我们人民的历史中间充满着英雄的呼吸，我们可以列举出我们无数的英雄儿女，像董存瑞和刘胡兰。这样的英雄儿女同样存在在朝鲜人民中间。在北京文学工作者抗美援朝的一次集会上，我听见朝鲜作家韩雪野先生讲的一段话，这段话使我深深的感动。他说在朝鲜战场上，一次，有一个北朝鲜战士在向敌人阵地冲击时负了重伤，倒在两军阵前。他发现这是一个布雷区。可是这个时候自己的坦克部队正向这一段危险地带开来，——他招手，他喊，他们却听不见。他急了，为了保护祖国的坦克和同志，他用了最后力量扑到地雷上，他跟随地雷爆炸而牺牲了自己。这警告了祖国的坦克队，他们转了方向然后再冲向敌人。这段话使我听了非常感动，因为我知道，这一个朝鲜的无名英雄，他用他的全生命保卫的不只是一辆以至更多辆坦克，而是朝鲜的土地和人民。但我要说他同时保卫的也是中国人民的和平与安全。为什么可以这样说呢？——因为我们有美国炮弹烧毁的村庄还未恢复，给美国手铐铐过的人还能说话，给美国子弹打死的人的儿女还未长大，给美国子弹打破的创疤还未平复，……谁都记得，在不久以前，美帝国主义侵入过中国，而且在中国留下无数污秽的犯罪行为。现在他们不过又从另外一条路向我们走来，——我们，胜利了的中国人民清醒的知道，他们是向我们走来。正如同希特勒只能走拿破伦的老路，美帝国主义现在走的是日本帝国主义的老路，从朝鲜侵向我们的鸭绿江。同时，我们还应该知道，在朝鲜战场布雷区的这一个无名英雄，他保卫的也就是全世界的和平。因为，如果在朝鲜对侵略者没有这种坚决的打击，麦克阿瑟就会更疯狂，他就会更多的重复希特勒的恶魔的行为。
    我们中国人民志愿支援朝鲜人民的英勇行为，就是我们对美帝国主义的回答，也就是对祖国的宣誓，也就是对世界和平的宣誓。
    最近，麦克阿瑟已经在抱怨那“人迹不到的荒山，漫天漫野的大雪，和零下二十多度的天气”。可是除了他们那帝国主义疯狂的侵略性之外，并没有谁从纽约请他们到这荒山里来呀。事实上在北朝鲜的绝非只是一片荒山和雪地，而是火热的热情，——这就是中国志愿援朝人民和朝鲜人民的战斗的火焰。真正感到寒冷的是麦克阿瑟，因为在北朝鲜对他降临的不只是自然界的冬季。他的命运中的冬季也已经开始了。历史早已证明，侵略者的方向只有一个，——那就是失败与灭亡。
    我们中国人民志愿的抗美援朝行为是百分之百正确的。因为，谁都不会忘记刚刚一年以前的十月一日，谁都不会忘记当那第一面五星红旗由毛主席亲手升上祖国自由的天空，谁都会出自衷心的激动得流泪，谁都不会忘记在那一刻，我们第一次可以真诚的，自由的告慰于我们的先人，我们的同伴和我们的儿女。………总之，我们爱我们的胜利，就要保卫我们的胜利，我们爱我们的和平，就要保卫我们的和平。当美帝国主义者又一次把战争火焰向我们烧来的时候，我们志愿的支援朝鲜，就等于支援自己祖国，就等于支援自己，就等于支援自己的儿女能自由的笑、自由的成长的权利。不只在今天，我们中国人民还要宣誓我们永远要支援正义与真理，永远要反对美帝国主义者，反对他对人民的侵略，反对他对文化的毁灭。
    坚定的人民是永远看着明天的，我还应该讲几句关于明天的话。我要说战斗中的中、朝人民不是最后一次合作，我们的亲密的合作还要在审判美帝国主义战犯的法庭上出现。为和平而斗争过的人民，在历史上已经安排过一次光荣的审判，——那次是在纽伦堡，第二次在那里呢？未来的历史将会回答这个庄严的问题。杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、艾奇逊之流正在加紧制造他们自己的罪证。美帝国主义的罪证已经不少，审判的材料，已经到了整理的时间了。我们特别要记下麦克阿瑟的侵略路线，我们要把这张路线图带到正义的审判法庭上去，因为这上面粘结着中国人民和朝鲜人民、以及全世界被迫害的人民的鲜血，有一天，人民的鲜血是要以无比的雄辩来控诉他们的罪行的。
