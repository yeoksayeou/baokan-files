Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram on the 18th of this month to the Fukushima Court in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, protesting the illegal sentences against workers arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident" and demanding their immediate release. The telegram reads as follows:
To the Chief Judge of the Fukushima Court, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan:

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, representing the entire Chinese working class, strongly protests your illegal sentences against the twenty innocent individuals arrested in the "Matsukawa Incident" and demands their immediate release.

All-China Federation of Trade Unions, December 18th

Note: The "Matsukawa Incident" refers to the persecution of progressive workers by the Japanese reactionaries under the pretext of a train derailment at Matsukawa Station in Fukushima Prefecture on August 17th of last year. The twenty railway workers arrested in this "incident" were unreasonably sentenced to heavy penalties by the Fukushima District Court on the 5th of this month, including five death sentences and five life sentences. The "Matsukawa Incident" has aroused extreme anger among the Japanese people, who have launched a movement against persecution and demanding the release of the arrested workers, and have issued appeals to peace-loving and democratic people around the world for support.

    我全总致电日本福岛裁判所要求释放“松川事件”被捕工人
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：中华全国总工会于本月十八日致电日本福岛县福岛裁判所，抗议对“松川事件”被捕工人的非法判决，并要求立即释放他们。电文如下：日本福岛县福岛裁判所裁判长：
    中华全国总工会代表全中国工人阶级严重抗议你对“松川事件”被捕的二十名无辜者的非法判决；并要求你立即释放他们。
                                          中华全国总工会十二月十八日
    按：“松川事件”是日本反动当局借口去年八月十七日福岛县松川站的火车出轨，迫害进步工人的事件。在该“事件”中被捕的二十名铁道工人，已于本月五日被福岛地方法院无理判处重刑，其中包括死刑五人，无期徒刑五人。“松川事件”引起了日本人民的极端愤怒，发起了反对迫害，要求释放“松川事件”被捕工人的运动，并向全世界爱好和平民主人士发出要求声援的呼吁。
