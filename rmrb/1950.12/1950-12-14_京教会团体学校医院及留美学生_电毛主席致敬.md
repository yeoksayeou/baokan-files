To our beloved Chairman Mao, the people's mentor!

You lead us, teach us to stand up, teach us to move forward, teach us to fight for freedom, fight for peace, and fight for glorious victory.

On November 28th, the rogue representative of the US imperialism in the United Nations Security Council, Austin, uttered a series of lies to slander the Chinese people. He specifically mentioned the religious followers in China, those who teach and study in church schools, those who serve in church hospitals, and anyone who has ever taken a sip of cool water from the hands of Americans. Graduates of American schools, whether the schools are in the United States or established by Americans on Chinese soil based on unequal treaties, have also been insulted by him. Of course, this is not the first time that US imperialism has slandered us. However, this time, after the complete and utter failure of military aggression, and during the enthusiastic development of the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, they still dare to bare their fangs. People like Austin are truly shameless beyond words.

Beloved Chairman, today, December 13th, church groups, schools, hospitals, students studying in the US, and other people who have been insulted in Beijing have united to hold a demonstration parade to teach a lesson to Austin, the running dog and rogue of Wall Street, and slap his lying mouth. The Chinese Christian Church has already decided to achieve self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation in the short term, and more than 20,000 believers have solemnly signed their names on the declaration. Church schools and church hospitals will never allow US imperialism to drag us down. With the People's Government as our backing, we are not afraid of not having the opportunity to serve the people. Among us, some have graduated from American universities, and are now working in the people's posts. Due to personal experience, we have a clearer understanding of the mask and true face of US imperialism. We will dedicate ourselves to the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country, and fight to the end with imperialism. Chairman, rest assured. We will all follow you and, under your leadership, redouble our efforts to do our job well. We wish you good health!

    京教会团体学校医院及留美学生
    电毛主席致敬敬爱的毛主席，人民的导师！
    你领导我们，教我们站起来，教我们向前走，教我们争取自由，争取和平，争取光荣的胜利。
    十一月二十八日，美帝驻联合国安理会的流氓代表奥斯汀说了一大套的谎话来诬蔑中国人民。其中特别提到中国的教徒，在教会学校教书念书的人，在教会医院服务的人，凡是从美国人手里喝过一杯凉水的人。美国学校的毕业生，不论那学校是在美国的，或是美国人根据不平等条约在中国的土地上设立的，那些人也受到他的污辱，美帝诬蔑我们，这当然不是头一回了，可是这一次，在军事侵略全盘彻底失败的时候，在中国人民抗美援朝运动热烈开展的时候，还敢那样张牙咧嘴，奥斯汀之类的人真是无耻到不能更无耻的了。
    敬爱的主席，今天，十二月十三日，全北京市的教会团体、学校、医院、留美学生以及其他受了污辱的人，联合起来，举行了示威大游行，来教训华尔街的走狗流氓奥斯汀，捽他撒谎的嘴巴。中国基督教会早已决定在短时期之内自立自养自传，已经有两万多的教徒在宣言上严肃的把名字签上。教会学校、教会医院，也决不许美帝把我们扯上。有人民政府做我们的后盾，我们绝不怕没有为人民服务的机会。我们中间，曾经在美国大学毕过业的，现在都在人民的岗位上工作，由于切身的经验，更清楚认识美帝的假面具、真嘴脸。我们要献身于抗美援朝，保家卫国的工作，跟帝国主义决斗到底。主席你放心。我们都跟着你走，在你的领导下，加倍努力，做好我们的工作。祝你康健！
