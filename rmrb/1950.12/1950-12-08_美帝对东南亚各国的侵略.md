    US Imperialism's Aggression Against Southeast Asian Countries

    I. US Imperialism is the Deadly Enemy of the Southeast Asian People

    Just as recently, US imperialist elements, warmonger Dulles and Austin, distorted the history of US imperialism's aggression against China over the past century, talking glibly about the "long-term, close friendship between the Chinese and American people," so too have Truman and Acheson and their ilk pretended to be "friends" of the Southeast Asian people and "sponsors" of colonial liberation movements, in order to reverse right and wrong, confuse black and white, and deceive the people. However, the relentless historical facts eloquently prove that American imperialism is not only not our friend and the friend of the Southeast Asian people, but that it has replaced the Japanese fascist beasts that have been defeated and has become the most insidious and most vicious enemy of our country and the people of Southeast Asian countries.

    American imperialism's aggression against the Asian people has intensified after the Second World War. As a result of the war, Japan, a strong enemy in the Pacific, was defeated, and colonial empires such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands in the Pacific were greatly weakened. However, the war strengthened the position of the United States as never before. Thus, American imperialism believed that the time had come to establish hegemony in Asia. On the one hand, it actively supported the Japanese fascist forces, turning Japan into a general military base for aggression against Asia, and vigorously helped Chiang Kai-shek to carry out the anti-people civil war, attempting to destroy the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people and turn China into a major military base for attacking the Soviet Union and invading Southeast Asia; on the other hand, it actively seized the positions of the British, French, and Dutch colonial empires in Southeast Asia, aided reactionaries in various countries, and suppressed national liberation movements in various countries.

    However, the result of US imperialism's six billion US dollar aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was not only failure to destroy the Chinese people's revolution; on the contrary, the Chinese people defeated the joint offensive of the US and Chiang and won a nationwide victory. US imperialism did not and will not learn the lessons it should have from this bitter defeat. It continues to aid the remaining bandits in their death throes, and also establishes an anti-communist blockade line around our country, from the Aleutian Islands in the north, through Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, to the Philippines, attempting to attack our country from Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, and to intensify the suppression of the increasingly high national liberation movements in these countries under the encouragement of our country's revolutionary victory.

    After the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Chiang bandits fled to Taiwan, US imperialism, in order to strengthen its encirclement of the new China, intensified its aggression against Southeast Asian countries. US personnel executing the aggression "visited" Southeast Asia one after another, and held a series of meetings to discuss and deploy aggression matters. American Ambassador-at-Large Jessup began his Far East "inspection" at the end of last year. Following Jessup, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, Chief of Naval Operations Sherman, Chief of Staff of the Army Collins, and Chief of Staff of the Air Force Vandenberg also "inspected" the Far East at the end of January. After Jessup's activities in various places, he personally presided over the "US Far East Diplomatic Personnel Conference" in Bangkok on February 13 to discuss and deploy specific plans and measures for aggression against the Asian people. Then, from April 17 to 22, US embassy personnel stationed in the Far East held a "Far East Economic Conference" in Tokyo, specifically to discuss how to implement US imperialism's economic aggression plan in Asia in the new situation in which the People's China had emerged. Subsequently, an "economic survey team" headed by Griffin went to Southeast Asian countries to "investigate" the situation in various countries in order to strengthen economic control.

    As the People's Republic of China becomes increasingly consolidated, the Southeast Asian national liberation movement continues to rise, and the American economic crisis deepens, US imperialism is even more妄图 to stop the wheels of history from moving forward and directly carry out armed aggression against the Asian people. The war of aggression against Korea is a beginning.

    II. A New Stage of US Imperialism's Aggression Against Southeast Asia

    US imperialism's armed aggression against Korea marks a new stage in US imperialism's aggression against the Far East and Southeast Asian people, that is, from the past economic and military assistance to the reactionary factions in Southeast Asian countries, it has embarked on a stage of openly and directly interfering in the liberation movements of the Asian people.

    Truman issued a statement that sabotaged Far Eastern peace and was provocative on the third day after the outbreak of the Korean War (June 27). In addition to ordering the dispatch of US land, sea, and air forces to invade Korea and ordering the US Seventh Fleet to invade and occupy our country's Taiwan by force, the statement also "instructed to strengthen the US military in the Philippines, strengthen assistance to the Philippine government, and accelerate military assistance to the French and member countries' troops in Indochina, and send military missions to establish close working relationships with these troops." An August 2 Associated Press dispatch stated that MacArthur, the chief culprit of US imperialism's aggression against Korea, also openly clamored: "The Korean War is only a part of the Far East anti-communist war. He also believes that in the Far East, the United Nations and the United States must support every 'threatened' region, as in the case of Korea. Such regions that should be supported include Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, Malaya, and Indonesia." This means that US imperialism wants to openly carry out armed aggression against Southeast Asian countries like it is invading Korea.

    The US military mission led by Melby went to Southeast Asia in early July for more than two months of aggressive activities, with footprints all over Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, and Indonesia. The mission particularly emphasized Vietnam, which is one of the three main directions for US imperialism's attack on our country. It stayed in Vietnam for as long as three weeks, during which it held a series of meetings with the commander-in-chief of the French colonial army and the heads of the Bao Dai puppet regime to discuss and deploy the suppression of the Vietnamese people's liberation movement, and inspected important strategic strongholds of the French army on the Sino-Vietnamese border. At the same time, in order to strengthen its aggression in Vietnam, US imperialism expanded its institutions and personnel stationed in Vietnam. US imperialism established "the largest mission in Southeast Asia in Saigon, with a total of 150 to 200 people" (Associated Press reporter Topping). These personnel are stationed in the US diplomatic, Economic Cooperation Administration, military, and propaganda institutions in Saigon, engaging in aggression activities in Vietnam's political, military, economic, and cultural fields. Moreover, in order to strengthen direct control over the ‘military aid’ to the French colonial army and the Bao Dai puppet army and direct the war of aggression against the Republic of Vietnam, US imperialism also sent a large military advisory group headed by Brink to be permanently stationed in Saigon. Since June, the United States has begun to accelerate the shipment of 30 million US dollars worth of military supplies to Vietnam; small arms, artillery, aircraft, and ships have been continuously arriving in Saigon. The Philippines, this is the military base for US imperialism's aggression against Asia, and the guard dog guarding the gates of Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and China. On the eve of the Korean War, US imperialism had already strengthened the strength of its garrison on the Philippine Islands. According to a June 2 dispatch from the Kuomintang Central News Agency, "The number of American jet aircraft based on land north of Manila has increased to about 200. The US armed forces stationed in the Philippines have also increased significantly in recent weeks." After the outbreak of the Korean War, US imperialism more extensively implemented the US-Philippine military agreement to greatly build and expand the 23 old military bases in the Philippines and build new bases. Similarly, large quantities of military supplies and military equipment were shipped to Manila. In Thailand, US imperialism's aggression activities have greatly intensified. US imperialism and the Luang Phibunsongkhram government signed the "Thai-US Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement" on September 19, and then signed the "US-Thai Military Assistance Agreement" on October 17. US imperialism used 10 million US dollars worth of military supplies to arm the Thai army as bait, inducing Thailand to become a source of cannon fodder, a source of military food, and an important military base for US imperialism's aggression. According to the New York Times, US imperialism has begun to arm the Thai reactionary army in accordance with the agreement. The equipment needed by the Thai Marine Corps and Air Force has been shipped, and about 20 American military advisory groups have also arrived. More than a dozen Thai army battalions have received American equipment, and another 20 battalions will receive the equipment next year. US imperialism also signed a "US-Burma Economic Cooperation Bilateral Agreement" with Burma on September 13, deciding to turn Rangoon into a military port. As the Kyodo News Agency pointed out at the time, "This is a new action by US imperialism to turn Burma into a link in a series of US bases in Asia." On October 16, US imperialism also signed the "US-Indonesia Economic Assistance Agreement" with Indonesia. US imperialism gave Indonesia a portion of the 40 million US dollars previously allocated to Chiang Kai-shek, stepping up its seizure of the rights and interests of the British and Dutch colonial empires in Indonesia, and further plundering Indonesia's rich resources.

    The above are some major facts about US imperialism's intensified and open direct aggression against Southeast Asian countries since the Korean War. From these facts, it is not difficult to see that US imperialism has used various agreements and assistance to step up the establishment of an encirclement around our country in order to encircle and attack us. This is worthy of our serious attention and vigilance.

    III. Methods of US Imperialism's Aggression Against Southeast Asia

    Although US imperialism's aggression against Southeast Asian countries has adopted various different methods and approaches due to the different situations in various countries, the general principle is to politically support the reactionary factions in various countries as tools to suppress the people of various countries; economically, it manipulates the economic lifelines of various countries and plunders the rich resources of various countries through investment loans, "cooperation," and "assistance"; militarily, it arms, trains, and raises puppet armies in various countries and seizes military bases in order to suppress the increasingly rising and growing national liberation movements in these countries, and turn these countries into its colonies, vassal states, and military bases for engaging in aggressive wars.

    For example, the "nightclub emperor" - the Bao Dai puppet regime, which is spurned by the Vietnamese people, was fostered by US imperialism. US imperialism sent the notorious warmonger, former US ambassador to France Bullitt, to Saigon in September 1947 and February 1948 to discuss with the French side the manufacture of a puppet regime to counter the Republic of Vietnam, and to Hong Kong to induce Bao Dai to return to the country to restore the throne. On March 8, 1949, US imperialism again forced France and Vietnam to sign the so-called "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" and personally delivered this illegitimate puppet regime. US imperialism immediately rushed to formally recognize this regime, and forced its servant countries to recognize this regime, attempting to create some political capital for Bao Dai. Luang Phibunsongkhram of Thailand, who is known as the "Franco of the East," was also rescued from prison by US imperialism and helped him seize power. It can be said that the Luang Phibunsongkhram government is completely controlled by US imperialism. The Nanyang Siang Pau reported on December 9, 1949, that American consultants have filled the Thai government, including financial consultant Gu Er, commercial consultant Scott, and behind-the-scenes consultant Biton, who controls Thai diplomacy. Burma, under the coercion and inducement of US imperialism, is increasingly leaning towards US imperialism. The Quirino regime in the Philippines is an absolutely loyal running dog raised by US imperialism. In this way, US imperialism actively supports the dregs and traitors of the people of Southeast Asian countries to serve as its tools for engaging in aggression.

    Economically, US imperialism gradually seized the economic positions of the British, French, and Dutch colonial empires in Southeast Asia, and then expanded and strengthened its own positions, and vigorously plundered the rich resources of these countries. In Vietnam, US capital has penetrated Vietnam's tin, manganese, rubber, and other enterprises. Now American monopoly capital groups are striving to invade on a large scale. The Wall Street mouthpiece, the New York Times, openly proclaimed: "Indochina is an object worthy of a big gamble. The north has tin, tungsten, manganese, coal, timber, and rice that can be exported; the south has rice, rubber, tea, pepper, livestock, and hides." In Thailand, US capital has actually controlled the Thai economy. The Thai-US Forestry Co., Ltd., which is "cooperating between the United States and Thailand," monopolizes the entire Thai forestry industry, and the United States further monopolizes Thailand's transportation, water conservancy, rice industry, and other enterprises through this company. Not only that, American personnel are also engaged in surveying Thailand's rich mineral deposits under the name of "cooperation" in order to plunder Thailand's mineral resources in large quantities. American monopoly capital almost completely controls the entire export of Thailand's main strategic materials, tin and rubber. Citibank in the United States also has a branch in Bangkok, with strong capital, manipulating Thailand's finances. After the signing of the "Thai-US Economic Assistance Agreement," American personnel executing economic aggression arrived in Thailand one after another. The rampant invasion of Thailand by US imperialism even caused the Thai right-wing newspaper *Sareepatra* to exclaim in panic: "Americans are pouring into Thailand, similar to the situation when Europeans invaded the wilderness of the American West in the old days. Every plane arriving in Thailand is full of American businessmen and adventurers." In Indonesia, US capital has actually monopolized Indonesia's economic life. Before the war, US imperialism's investment in Indonesia only accounted for 5% of the total foreign investment, while now, out of the 2.5 billion US dollars of foreign investment, US capital accounts for more than 1 billion US dollars, that is, 40%. Fox, the agent of the American monopoly capital group, signed the "Fox Agreement" with the Yogyakarta government as early as January 1948, allowing the Indonesian government to use Fox's funds and obtaining the privilege of monopolizing Indonesia's entire import and export trade for 15 years. In 1949, US representative Cochran and Hatta signed an agreement to exclusively control Indonesian resources before going to The Hague to participate in the Round Table Conference. According to this agreement, the right to develop Indonesian oil and rubber belongs to American trusts, and it is stipulated that US imperialism will invest 1 billion US dollars in Indonesian rubber and oil in the next five years. Subsequently, agents of American monopoly capital poured into Indonesia like locusts. Now the American Rubber Company owns one million acres of rubber plantations in Indonesia. US capital controls the famous Bangka Island and Belitung tin mines that previously belonged to the Dutch tin company. In April of this year, US imperialism also negotiated with the Indonesian government on transporting tin to the United States for strategic material storage. As a result, Indonesia agreed to give the United States tin worth 80 million US dollars. Now Indonesia has become the main supplier of tin sand to the United States, accounting for 80% of the high-quality tin sand imported by the United States. US Steel Corporation monopolizes the nickel in Sulawesi. Ford Motor Company enjoys the exclusive sales rights of automobiles in Indonesia. The "American Overseas Petroleum Company" has obtained the privilege of exploring and developing oil sources in Java. The "American Refining Company" has obtained the privilege of mining and refining Indonesian non-ferrous metals. The US Import-Export Bank loaned another 100 million US dollars to Indonesia in February of this year, and the bank's investment also manipulates the "Dutch-Indian Renaissance Bank." Moreover, American monopoly capitalists also bought rich lead mines and sugar, quinine, coconut, tea, and coffee plantations from the Dutch. Today, US imperialism is intensifying its exclusion of Dutch and British forces in Indonesia, greedily and robber-like plundering Indonesia's wealth in large quantities. Fox, the agent of US imperialism, has become the actual economic dictator of Indonesia. The economic position of US imperialism in Malaya is also gradually strengthening. In August, the *Young Bolshevik* magazine stated that American companies have obtained the right to exploit the tin mines in Perak and Selangor. In July 1948, US imperialism forced the British Empire to abolish the tariff that had existed for half a century to restrict the export of tin ore from Malaya, breaking Britain's monopoly on tin. As for Malayan rubber, which accounts for the first place in the world in terms of output, as early as 1947, 590,000 tons of rubber worth 66 million US dollars were shipped to the United States. Now the American rubber concern "American Rubber Company" has penetrated deep into the heart of Malaya, deep into the ports of Port Klang, Singapore, and Penang. US monopoly capital has also occupied large rubber plantations in Pahang and Negeri Sembilan that previously belonged to the British. The amount of American goods imported into Malaya has increased eight times compared with before the war. Burma's door has been opened to US capital due to the signing of the enslaving "US-Burma Economic Assistance Agreement." As for the Philippines, it is an absolutely colonial economy. US imperialism, through the Roxas and Quirino puppet regimes, formulated two enslaving bills, the so-called "Bell Trade Act" and the "Equal Rights Act." Through these two bills, US imperialism continued to maintain its privilege of developing the natural resources of the Philippine Islands, and controlled Philippine banks, industries, foreign trade, mine production, marine fisheries, and transportation. American goods flood the Philippine market, of which 90% are consumer goods. All production in the Philippines must adapt to the needs of US imperialism. Although the Philippines' rice production is still insufficient, the Philippines is still unable to increase rice production and is forced to produce raw materials for US imperialism's use. At the same time, the Philippines is the world-famous producer of Luzon tobacco, but in order to dump American cigarettes, it still has to be forced to pay 24 million US dollars every year. As a result of US imperialism's continued use of the Philippines as its raw material supply base and commodity market, it has brought profound suffering and disaster to the Philippine people, making the vast majority of people live in poverty and hunger. According to statistics in March of this year, out of the 18 million people in the Philippines, 3 million are unemployed, reaching an alarming proportion of one out of every six people. Even those who are lucky enough to find a job live in semi-starvation. The minimum living expenses for a family of three are 7 pesos per day, but the Philippine government stipulates that the daily wage is only 1.25 pesos. The lives of farmers are the same. The New York Times also admitted that in Nueva Ecija, one of the basic granaries of the Philippines, farmers can only eat one meal a day, and the main food is vegetable roots and grass. The plight of the people in other places that do not produce food can be imagined. However, US imperialism is not satisfied with this. Recently, it sent the Bell Economic Mission to the Philippines to investigate. As a result, it submitted a report on the "Strengthening the Economic Plan of the Republic of the Philippines," attempting to use this to shirk its responsibility for the Philippine economic crisis caused by its colonial exploitation, and to create a basis for further control of the Philippine economy. Just these can expose the essence of the so-called "freedom and independence" of the Philippines that Acheson and his ilk have repeatedly boasted about. The "freedom and independence" in the mouth of US imperialism is just a synonym for enslavement and colonies.

    Militarily, the "independence" of the Philippines has completely gone bankrupt. According to the "US-Philippines Military Base Agreement" signed in March 1947, the United States has obtained the "lease" of 23 military bases for a period of 99 years. US imperialism has stationed troops at these bases. The American military advisory group is the supreme ruler of the Philippines. They are responsible for arming, training, and directing the suppression of the Philippine people's national liberation movement. The airplanes and artillery transported by the United States are used to massacre the Philippine people. United Press International openly reported on April 14: "Philippine Air Force fighter jets today attacked 400 MinKang Army guerrillas crossing a river 40 miles north of Manila, and these planes were "50 P-51 fighter jets given to the Philippines by the United States last week under the military assistance program. These planes were immediately dispatched to participate in operations against 'rebellious' troops." Not only that, US imperialism also personally trains a large number of puppet army cadres. United Press International reported on February 9, citing the US Embassy in the Philippines, "The United States continues to help the Philippines train the main personnel of the defense agency. Within three years, 283 students have been sent to US military schools for training." According to Kyodo News Agency on September 20, citing the London Times, in order to suppress the Philippine people's liberation movement, "the United States has spent 2 billion US dollars to aid the corrupt Quirino regime." Quirino is simply the Chiang Kai-shek of the Philippines. *US News & World Report* also pointed out in panic: the Philippines has become "another new bottomless pit of US aid." In Vietnam, in addition to arming the French army and the puppet army, and sending military advisory groups to armed intervene in the Vietnamese people's liberation movement, US imperialism also conspired to use former Japanese officers and soldiers as mercenaries for its aggression against Vietnam. A Xinhua News Agency dispatch on July 21 stated that since last winter, MacArthur has been using pro-Japanese Vietnamese traitors who have been living in Japan for 45 years, Bao Dai's uncle Prince Qiang Diqin, to search for remnants of Japanese fascist war criminals in Japan, to organize a "Volunteer Army to Aid Vietnam," and to set up a headquarters for assembling troops in Tokyo. Prince Qiang Diqin and his Japanese assistant, Major Takehiko Yamazaki, are now preparing to return to Vietnam. At the same time, MacArthur secretly instructed former Japanese Lieutenant General Iwato to organize a Japanese volunteer army, and stipulated that the Nikken and Fuji Sangyo munitions enterprises should be responsible for supplying Bao Dai with weapons and equipment. MacArthur has also telegraphed former Japanese Commander-in-Chief in Vietnam, Lieutenant General Tsuchihashi, who is now in Saigon, ordering him to contact Bao Dai to discuss the organization of a Japanese volunteer army. Following MacArthur's orders, the Japanese troops recruited to Vietnam were all given short-term training by US military officers. This fully exposes the conspiracy of US imperialists to massively armed intervene in the Vietnamese people's liberation movement. In Indonesia, US imperialism armed the Dutch colonial army to massacre the Indonesian people who were fighting for freedom and independence. Last year's *New Era*, Issue 2, carried an article stating that a reporter for the American *Baltimore Sun* reported in detail: "Washington not only supplied the Dutch colonial army with weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment, but even supplied the rations issued to the Dutch army. The Netherlands received war materials worth 140 million US dollars from the United States." US imperialism is also stepping up its seizure of military bases in Indonesia. In March of this year, Major General Wickett, a member of MacArthur's Air Force Staff, went to Jakarta to negotiate with the Hatta government, "requesting permission for the United States to conduct military surveys and map-making in the strategic Indonesian archipelago" (Associated Press, March 3). Subsequently, American strategic experts went to Indonesia to draw up military maps. Now, American military bases are being built in Borneo, Java, Sulawesi, and New Guinea. This activity of US imperialism to seize military bases is intensifying with the intensification of military expansion.

    IV. The Upsurge of the Southeast Asian People's Liberation Movement

    All these facts show that US imperialism has now replaced Japan as the main and most vicious enemy of the people of Southeast Asia who are fighting for freedom and independence. Acheson pretended to have a false face, saying "we treat the Asian people as friends and care for them, we do not want to take anything from them for ourselves, we do not want to deprive them of any opportunity, any freedom, and any rights, we do not want to use them to achieve any of our own goals." But isn't the large amount of wealth such as oil, rubber, and tin plundered by US imperialism from Southeast Asia? Isn't it US imperialism that is currently trying its best to suppress and destroy the national liberation movements of the Southeast Asian people and enslave the Southeast Asian people? What US imperialism is doing in Southeast Asian countries and what Acheson said are slapping his own face.

    Today, under the encouragement of the great victory of the Chinese revolution, the people of Southeast Asia are carrying out heroic struggles against the national and social oppression of the colonial empire headed by US imperialism, against colonial enslavement, and for freedom and national independence. From Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya to the Philippines, the flames of the people's liberation movement are burning everywhere.

    Under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people have carried out heroic and resolute struggles against the French colonialists and their American masters for five years, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. In order to carry out this bloody "dirty war," the French Empire spends 115 billion francs every year, causing a huge deficit in the French budget. The casualties of the French Expeditionary Force have reached 150,000. The area occupied by the French army does not exceed 10% of the entire territory of Vietnam, while the People's Liberation Army has liberated more than 90% of the territory. Since the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army launched the autumn offensive, it has liberated many important strategic strongholds of the French army in North Vietnam, and won unprecedented brilliant victories in the battles of Cao Bang and Lang Son, making American and French imperialism feel great panic. The People's Army is now threatening the French colonialists' old lair, Hanoi.

    The flames of the People's Liberation Movement have also spread throughout the Philippine Islands. The Philippine People's Armed Forces had only 30,000 regular troops and 50,000 militiamen when Japan surrendered, but have now grown to 200,000. The People's Liberation Army is carrying out activities on various islands, and has even expanded to Cebu, Panay, and Negros. The guerrillas are attacking everywhere, inflicting heavy casualties on the Philippine puppet army, making US imperialism feel great panic and unease. Even United Press International said: "Americans and other foreigners in the Philippines today feel like they are sitting on a powder keg." Under the feet of US imperialism and its lackeys, the earth is burning.

    The Malayan people are bravely resisting the British Empire's bandit-like war. Although the British Empire has dispatched more than 120,000 troops equipped with aircraft and tanks, and dispatched a large number of local "punitive expeditions," it still cannot stop the Malayan National Liberation Army and guerrillas from growing stronger day by day. In the course of the struggle, they have established scattered liberated areas in central and northeastern Malaya. The British Empire妄图 to destroy the National Liberation Army, and announced a "bandit suppression month" in February of this year, but this month turned into a "counter-attack month" for the people. The activities of the People's Armed Forces have recently become more strengthened, causing increasingly serious losses to the British army. The British Army Commander-in-Chief in Malaya has had to call the situation of the British army in Malaya a "disaster," and he admitted that the Malayan National Liberation Army is now stronger than last year. The British Empire's quagmire in Malaya is getting deeper and deeper.

    The Indonesian people's struggle for national independence is continuing. In many areas, guerrillas are still fighting fiercely. The flames of freedom and independence are rising on the Indonesian archipelago.

    The national liberation movement is also expanding in Burma. The liberated areas of Burma and the Burmese People's Armed Forces are growing stronger day by day. Half of Burma is controlled by the People's Armed Forces.

    As Malenkov pointed out long ago: "The national liberation struggle of the people of Asia, the Pacific, and the entire colonial world has risen to a new and far higher level than in the past." Under the encouragement of the great strengthening of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, especially under the encouragement of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the people of Southeast Asia who are fighting for freedom and independence will confidently move towards victory.

    美帝对东南亚各国的侵略
    一、美帝是东南亚人民的死敌
    正如最近美帝国主义分子，战贩杜勒斯与奥斯汀歪曲美帝百年来侵略中国的史实，大谈其“中美人民长期的，密切的友谊”一样，杜鲁门与艾奇逊之流也曾伪装东南亚人民的“友人”，殖民地解放运动的“赞助者”，借以颠倒是非，混淆黑白，欺骗人民。然而，无情的历史事实雄辩地证明了：美国帝国主义不仅不是我们与东南亚人民的友人，而且它已代替了已被打垮的日本法西斯猛兽，成为我国与东南亚各国人民最阴险与最凶恶的敌人了。
    美帝国主义对亚洲人民的侵略，在第二次世界大战后便变本加厉了。战争的结果，太平洋上的劲敌日本已被打败，而英、法、荷等太平洋上的殖民帝国也大为削弱。但是，战争却把美国的地位空前加强。这样，美帝国主义便认为建立亚洲霸权的时机已经到来。它一方面积极扶植日本法西斯势力，将日本变为侵略亚洲的总军事基地，极力帮助蒋介石进行反人民的内战，企图摧毁中国人民的革命势力，变中国为进攻苏联与侵略东南亚的主要军事基地；另一方面，它积极夺取英、法、荷等殖民帝国在东南亚的阵地，援助各国反动派，镇压各国民族解放运动。
    然而，美帝以六十亿美元援助蒋介石匪帮的结果，不仅未能摧毁中国人民的革命，相反地，中国人民击败了美蒋的联合进攻，并取得全国的胜利。美帝并未也不会从这一惨败中记取应有的教训。它继续援助残匪进行垂死挣扎，而且还在我国周围建立从北起阿留申群岛，经日本、朝鲜、台湾、越南、泰国、马来亚至菲律宾的反共封锁线，企图从朝鲜、台湾与越南进攻我国，并加紧镇压这些国家在我国革命胜利鼓舞下日趋高涨的民族解放运动。
    在中华人民共和国成立，蒋匪逃窜台湾后，美帝为了加强对新中国的包围，便加紧对东南亚各国的侵略。美帝执行侵略的人员纷纷“访问”东南亚，并召开了一系列会议，商讨与部署侵略事宜。美国无任所大使耶塞普去年年底首先开始了远东“视察”。继耶塞普之后，美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷、海军参谋长薛尔曼、陆军参谋长柯林斯、空军参谋长范登堡又于一月底“巡视”远东。耶塞普在各地活动后，并于二月十三日在曼谷亲自主持召开“美国远东外交人员会议”，商讨与部署侵略亚洲人民的具体计划与措施。接着于四月十七日至二十二日驻远东各地的美使馆人员又在东京举行了“远东经济会议”，专门讨论在出现了人民中国的新形势下，如何实施美帝对亚洲的经济侵略计划。随后，以葛利芬为首的“经济考察团”，又赴东南亚各国活动，“调查”各国情况，以便加强经济控制。
    当中华人民共和国日趋巩固，东南亚民族解放运动继续增高，美国经济危机日益加深的时候，美帝更妄图阻止历史的车轮前进，直接武装侵略亚洲人民，侵朝战争就是一个开始。
    二、美帝侵略东南亚的新阶段
    美帝武装侵略朝鲜，标志着美帝对远东及东南亚人民的侵略，已进入一新阶段，即由过去经济与军事援助东南亚各国反动派，走上了公开直接武装干涉亚洲各国人民解放运动的阶段。
    杜鲁门在朝鲜战争爆发后第三天（六月二十七日）便发表了破坏远东和平与挑衅的声明。该声明除下令派遣美国陆、海、空军侵略朝鲜与下令美国第七舰队武装侵占我国台湾外，并“指示加强美国在菲律宾的军队，加强对菲政府的援助，及加速以军事援助供给在印度支那的法国及成员国的军队，并派遣军事使团以便与这些部队建立密切的工作关系”。美联社八月二日电称，美帝侵朝元凶麦克阿瑟也公开叫嚣：“朝鲜战争不过是远东反共战争的一部分。他并相信：在远东，联合国及美国必须支援每一个‘受威胁’的地区，如对朝鲜的情形一样。这类应受支援的地区包括台湾、香港、越南、泰国、缅甸、马来亚及印尼”，这就是说，美帝要像侵略朝鲜一样，公开武装侵略东南亚各国。
    梅尔拜率领的美国军事使团七月初赴东南亚各地从事两个多月的侵略活动，足迹遍越南、菲律宾、泰国、缅甸、印尼等地。该使团特别着重越南，这是美帝进攻我国的三个主要方向之一，在越南就逗留三周之久，其间，曾与法殖民军总司令及保大傀儡政权首脑举行一连串会议，会商与部署了镇压越南人民的解放运动，并视察过中越边境法军重要战略据点。同时美帝为了加强在越南的侵略，扩大了它的驻越机构与人员。美帝在西贡建立了“东南亚最大的使团，人员总数达一百五十人至二百人”（美联社记者托平）。这些人员分驻在美国驻西贡的外交、经合分署、军事及宣传机构中，从事对越南的政治、军事、经济及文化等各方面的侵略活动。而且为了加强直接控制对法殖民军与保大傀儡军的‘军援’，指挥对越南共和国的侵略战争，美帝又派了以白林克为首的庞大军事顾问团常驻西贡。自六月份起，美国已开始将价值三千万美元的军火加速运赴越南；小型武器、大炮、飞机、舰船等已源源不绝运抵西贡。菲律宾，这是美帝侵略亚洲的军事基地，是守卫在朝鲜、越南、马来亚与中国大门的警犬。朝鲜战争爆发前夕，美帝即已加强菲岛驻军实力。据国民党中央社六月二日电称，“以马尼拉以北陆地为基地的美国喷气式飞机已增至二百架左右。美驻菲武装部队最近数周亦有显著增加”。朝鲜战争爆发后，美帝更广泛实施美菲军事协定大事修建与扩充在菲的二十三个旧军事基地和另建新基地。同样将大批军火及军事装备运至马尼拉。在泰国，美帝的侵略活动大为加紧。美帝与銮披汶政府于九月十九日签订了“泰美经济技术援助协定”，接着于十月十七日又签订了“美泰军事援助协定”。美帝以价值一千万美元的军火武装泰军为钓饵，诱使泰国成为美帝侵略炮灰的来源地、军粮供应地及重要军事基地。据纽约时报报道，美帝已根据该协定开始武装泰国反动军队。泰国陆战队、空军所需的装备已经运到，约二十名美国军事顾问团同时到达，已有泰陆军十多个营领到美国装备，另有二十个营将于明年获得该项装备。美帝九月十三日还与缅甸签订了“美缅经济合作双边协定”，决定将仰光变为军港，这正如当日电通社指出的，“这是美帝将缅甸变为美国在亚洲的一连串作战基地中的一环的新行动”。十月十六日，美帝又与印尼签订了“美印经济援助协定”。美帝给予印尼以前指拨给蒋匪的四千万美元的一部分，加紧夺取英、荷殖民帝国在印尼的权益，进一步掠取印尼的丰富资源。
    以上是朝鲜战争以来，美帝变本加厉公开的直接侵略东南亚各国的一些重大事实。从这些事实不难看出，美帝已经利用各种协定与援助，加紧在我国周围建立包围圈，以便包围和进攻我们。这是值得我们严重注意与警惕的。
    三、美帝侵略东南亚的方法
    美帝对东南亚各国的侵略，虽然由于各国情况的不同，曾采取了各种不同的方法方式，但一般的总是在政治上扶植各国反动派作为镇压各国人民的工具；在经济上以投资贷款、“合作”与“援助”方式，操纵各国的经济命脉，掠夺各国丰富的资源；在军事上武装、训练与豢养各国傀儡军，攫取军事基地，以达到镇压这些国家日益高涨与壮大中的民族解放运动，变这些国为其殖民地附庸国及其从事侵略战争中的军事基地。
    例如为越南人民所唾弃的“夜总会皇帝”——保大傀儡政权，就是美帝一手扶育起来的。美帝曾派臭名昭著的战贩、美前驻法大使布立特于一九四七年九月与一九四八年二月，先后赴西贡与法方商量制造傀儡政权，以对抗越南共和国，及赴香港诱使保大返国复辟。一九四九年三月八日，美帝又压迫法越签订所谓“法越协定”，并亲手为保大这个私生子傀儡政权接生。美帝随即抢着正式承认这一政权，而且压迫其仆从国家也承认这一政权，企图替保大制造点政治资本。素有“东方佛朗哥”之称的泰国銮披汶，也是美帝从监狱里搭救出来，帮助他夺取政权的。銮披汶政府可以说完全掌握在美帝手中。南侨日报一九四九年十二月九日载文称，美国顾问已充斥泰国政府，其中重要者有财政部顾问顾尔，商业部顾问斯各脱及左右泰国外交的幕后顾问碧顿。缅甸也在美帝的威迫利诱下，日益投靠美帝。菲律宾的季里诺政权，更是美帝豢养下的一条忠实的走狗。美帝就是这样积极扶植东南亚各国人民的败类、叛徒，来充当它从事侵略的工具。
    在经济上，美帝逐渐夺取了英、法、荷等殖民帝国在东南亚的经济阵地，进而扩大与加强自己的阵地，大事掠夺这些国家的丰富资源。在越南，美资已渗透越南的锡、锰、橡胶等企业。现美国垄断资本集团正力图大举侵入。华尔街的喉舌纽约时报公开宣扬：“印度支那是值得大赌一下的对象。北部有可以输出的锡、钨、锰、煤、木材和大米；南部有米、橡胶、茶叶、胡椒、牲畜、牛羊皮等”。在泰国，美资实际上已控制了泰国经济。美泰“合作的泰美森林有限公司”，垄断了全泰国的森林业，美国并通过该公司进而垄断了泰国的交通运输、水利、食米业及其他企业。不仅如此，美国人员还在“合作”的名义下，从事勘察泰国的丰富矿藏，以便大量掠夺泰国的矿产资源。美国垄断资本几乎完全控制了泰国主要战略物资锡与橡胶的全部出口。美国花旗银行并在曼谷设有分行，资金雄厚，操纵了泰国的金融。“美泰经济援助协定”签订后，美帝执行经济侵略的人员次第抵泰。美帝这样疯狂的侵入泰国，连泰国的右翼报纸《色里拍罗报》也不得不惊惶说：“美国人正在涌入泰国，和旧时欧洲人侵入美国西部旷野的情况相似。每架到达泰国的飞机，都载满了美国商人和冒险家”。在印尼，美资实际上已垄断了印尼的经济生活。战前美帝在印尼的投资，仅占外国总投资的百分之五，而现在二十五亿美元外国投资中，美资已占十亿美元以上即占百分之四十。美垄断资本集团在印尼的代理人福克斯早于一九四八年一月与日惹政府签订了“福克斯协定”，以允许印尼政府使用福克斯公司的资金，而掠得垄断印尼全部进出口贸易达十五年的特权。一九四九年美代表柯契伦与哈达于赴海牙参加圆桌会议以前，又签订独霸印尼资源的协定。根据该协定，开发印尼石油及橡胶之权，属于美国托辣斯，并规定美帝于今后五年内对印尼橡胶与石油投资十亿美元。接着，美国垄断资本的代理人便像蝗虫一样涌入印尼。现在美国橡胶公司在印尼拥有百万英亩的橡胶园。美资控制了从前属于荷兰锡公司的著名的邦加岛和勿里洞的锡矿。今年四月，美帝又与印尼政府进行将锡运给美国作为战略原料储存的谈判，结果印尼同意交给美国价值八千万美元的锡。现印尼已成为美国锡砂的主要供给者了，印尼锡砂占美国输入的优等锡砂的百分之八十。美国钢公司垄断了西里伯斯（苏拉威西）的镍。福特汽车公司在印尼享有汽车专卖权。“美国海外石油公司”已获得勘察及开发爪哇油源的特权。“美国提炼公司”获得开采及提炼印尼非铁金属的特权。美进出口银行今年二月又贷款一亿美元给印尼，该行的投资并操纵了“荷印复兴银行”。而且美垄断资本家还从荷兰人手中买入丰富的铅矿和糖、奎宁、椰子、茶叶及咖啡种植园。今天，美帝正在印尼加紧排斥荷、英的势力，贪得无餍地、强盗式地大量掠夺印尼的财富。美帝代理人福克斯已俨然成为印尼实际上的经济独裁者了。美帝在马来亚的经济地位也逐渐加强。八月份“青年布尔什维克”杂志称，美国公司已获得榨取普腊克和雪兰峨两地锡矿的权利。美帝并于一九四八年七月，强迫英帝把那存在已半世纪的限制马来亚锡矿输出的关税撤销了，打破了英国对锡的独占。至于占世界产量第一位的马来亚橡胶，早在一九四七年便有价值达六千六百万美元的五十九万吨橡胶输至美国。现在美国的橡皮康采恩“美国橡皮公司”已深入马来亚的心脏里面，深入巴生港、新加坡、槟榔屿等港口。美独占资本也占据了彭亨和森美兰从前属于英人的大树胶园。美国商品输入马来亚的数额较战前增加八倍。缅甸由于签订了奴役性的“美缅经济援助协定”，它的大门已为美资而洞开。至于说到菲律宾，那更是十足的殖民地经济。美帝通过罗哈斯、季里诺傀儡政权，制订了两个奴役性的法案，就是所谓“贝尔贸易法案”与“平等权利法案”。美帝通过这两个法案继续保持了开发菲岛自然资源的特权，并控制了菲银行、工业、对外贸易、矿场生产、海上渔业和交通运输等。美货泛滥菲市场，其中百分之九十都是消费品。菲律宾的一切生产都要适应美帝的需要。虽然菲国米产尚不敷用，但菲国仍不能增产米粮，而被迫生产供美帝使用的原料。同时，菲律宾是世界驰名的吕宋烟的产地，然而为了美国香烟的倾销，每年还须被迫付出二千四百万美元。美帝这样继续将菲律宾作为它的原料供应地及商品市场的结果，给菲国人民带来了深重的苦痛与灾难，使广大人民生活在贫困与饥饿中。根据今年三月的统计，全菲一千八百万人口中，便有三百万人失业，达到平均每六人中便有一人失业的可惊比例。纵使幸运找到职业的人，也是生活在半饥饿中。三口之家的最低生活费每日需七比索，但菲政府规定的工资每日只有一点二五比索。农民的生活也是一样。纽约时报也承认：在菲律宾的基本谷仓之一的奴查西哈省，农民每日只能吃一餐，而主要的食物是菜根与青草。其他不产粮食的地方的人民的苦况，更可想而知了。然而，美帝还不以此为满足。最近又派了贝尔经济使团赴菲调查，结果提出“加强菲律宾共和国经济计划”的报告，企图以此推卸由于其殖民地剥削而造成的菲律宾经济危机的罪责，为进一步控制菲国经济创造根据。单就这些就可揭穿艾奇逊之流一再所吹嘘的菲律宾的真正“自由独立”的实质了。美帝口中的“自由独立”，不过是奴役与殖民地的代名词而已。
    在军事上，菲律宾的“独立”更是彻底破产了。美国根据一九四七年三月签订的“美菲军事基地协定”，取得“租借”为期九十九年的二十三个军事基地。美帝在这些基地上驻有军队。美国军事顾问团是菲律宾的最高统治者。他们负责武装、训练并指挥镇压菲人民的民族解放运动。美国运去的飞机与大炮被使用来屠杀菲人民，合众社四月十四日就公开报道：“菲律宾空军战斗机今天攻击正在马尼拉以北四十英里的河上渡河的四百名民抗军游击队，而且这些飞机是“美国上周根据军援计划给予菲律宾的五十架Ｐ—５１型战斗机。这些飞机立即被派赴参加反对‘叛乱’军队的行动”。不仅如此，美帝还亲自训练大批傀儡军干部。合众社二月九日据美驻菲大使馆称，“美国不断帮助菲律宾训练国防机构的主要人员。在三年内，已有二百八十三名学生被派送美国军事学校训练。”据电通社九月二十日引伦敦泰晤士报称：为了镇压菲人民解放运动，“美国援助腐败的季里诺政权已花掉二十亿美元”。季里诺简直就是菲律宾的蒋介石。“美国新闻与世界报道”也惶恐地指出：菲律宾已成为“另一个美援的新的无底洞了”。在越南，美帝除了武装法军与傀儡军，派遣军事顾问团武装干涉越南人民解放运动而外，还阴谋利用前日本官兵作为他侵略越南的雇佣军。新华社七月二十一日电称，自去冬以来，麦克阿瑟利用留居日本四十五年的亲日派越奸，保大叔父强诋亲王，由他在日本搜罗日本法西斯战犯余孽，筹组“援越志愿军”，并在东京设立了组军总部。强诋亲王和他的日本助手山崎武彦少佐，现正准备返回越南。同时，麦克阿瑟又秘密指使前日军岩畔中将筹组日本志愿军，并规定由日建、富士产业等军火企业负责给保大供给武器与装备。麦克阿瑟并已致电现在西贡的前日本在越占领军总司令土桥中将，命令他与保大联络，商谈组织日本志愿军问题。遵麦克阿瑟的命令，被征募赴越的日军，都由美国军官进行短期训练。这充分的暴露了美帝国主义者企图大规模武装干涉越南人民解放运动的阴谋。在印尼，美帝曾武装荷兰殖民军屠杀争自由与独立的印尼人民。去年新时代第二期载文称，美国巴尔的摩尔太阳报记者对这曾详细报道说：“华盛顿不仅以武器、弹药及其他军事装备供给荷兰殖民军，甚至供给发给荷军的口粮。荷兰从美国手里收到价值一亿四千万美元的战争物资。”美帝并加紧在印尼攫取军事基地。今年三月麦克阿瑟空军参谋团团员威克特少将特赴雅加达与哈达政府进行谈判，“要求允许美国在战略的印尼群岛进行军事调查和绘制地图”（美联社三月三日电）。随后，美战略专家们便赴印尼绘制军略地图。现婆罗洲、爪哇、西里伯斯和新几内亚正在建筑美国军事基地。美帝这种攫取军事基地的活动，随着军事扩张的加紧而加紧起来了。
    四、东南亚人民解放运动的高涨
    以上这一切事实，说明了美帝国主义今天已代替日本成为东南亚争取自由与独立的人民的最主要与最凶恶的敌人了。艾奇逊曾装着一副假面孔，说什么“我们把亚洲人民当作朋友来关怀，我们不要为了我们自己本身从他们那里取得任何东西，我们不要使他们得不到任何机会，任何自由和任何权利，我们不要利用他们来达到我们自己的任何目的”。但是，美帝国主义掠夺的石油、橡胶、锡等大量财富不正是来自东南亚吗？目前正在极力镇压与摧毁东南亚人民的民族解放运动，奴役东南亚人民的不正是美帝国主义吗？美帝在东南亚各国所做的事，与艾奇逊所说的话，正自己打了自己的耳光。
    今天，东南亚的人民正在中国革命的伟大胜利的鼓舞下，进行着英勇的斗争，反对以美帝为首的殖民帝国的民族与社会的压迫，反对殖民地的奴役，争取自由与民族独立，从越南、印尼、马来亚到菲律宾，到处都燃烧着人民解放运动的烽火。
    越南人民在胡志明的领导下，五年来对法国殖民者及其美国主子进行了英勇而坚毅的斗争，予敌人重大损失。法帝为了进行这血腥的“肮脏战争”，每年耗费一千一百五十亿法郎，使法国的预算造成巨大赤字。法远征军的伤亡已达十五万人之巨。法军占领的地区不超过全越领土的百分之十，而人民解放军却解放了百分之九十以上的领土。越南人民解放军自展开秋季攻势以来，又解放了北越法军重要战略据点多处，并在高平、谅山线战役中赢得空前的辉煌胜利，使美法帝国主义感到莫大惊惶。人民军现正威迫法殖民者的老巢穴——河内。
    人民解放运动的烽火，也燃遍了菲岛。菲律宾人民武装力量在日本投降时只有正规军三万与民兵五万，现已发展到二十万人。人民解放军正在各岛展开活动，甚至扩展到宿雾、班乃和内革罗等岛。游击队更是到处出击，予菲傀儡军重大伤亡，使美帝感到极大恐慌与不安。连合众社都说：“美国人和在菲律宾的其他外国人，今天都觉得像坐在火药库上一样”。在美帝国主义及其走狗的脚下，大地是在燃烧着。
    马来亚人民正在英勇抗击英帝强盗式的战争，尽管英帝出动了十二万余装备有飞机与坦克的军队，并出动当地大量“讨伐队”，但仍不能阻止马来亚民族解放军与游击队的日益壮大。他们在斗争过程中，已在马来亚中部和东北部建立了分散的解放区。英帝妄图摧毁民族解放军，今年二月曾宣布“剿匪月”，可是，这个月却变为人民的“反击月”。人民武装的活动近更加强，正使英军遭到日益严重的损失，马来亚英军总司令将军不得不将马来亚的英军情势称为“灾难”，他并承认：马来亚民族解放军已比去年更加强大了。英帝在马来亚的泥足，是愈陷愈深了。
    印尼人民争取民族独立的斗争，正在坚持中。在很多地区，游击队仍然在进行着激战。印尼群岛上争自由与独立的火焰正高涨着。
    民族解放运动也在缅甸扩大着。缅甸的解放区和缅甸人民武装正日益成长与壮大。半个缅甸被人民武装控制着。
    正如马林科夫早就指出的：“亚洲、太平洋和整个殖民地世界的人民的民族解放斗争，已经上升到了一个新的远较过去为高的水平”。在和平、民主与社会主义阵营大大加强的鼓舞下，特别是在中国人民革命胜利的鼓舞下，争自由与独立的东南亚人民将满怀信心地走向胜利。
