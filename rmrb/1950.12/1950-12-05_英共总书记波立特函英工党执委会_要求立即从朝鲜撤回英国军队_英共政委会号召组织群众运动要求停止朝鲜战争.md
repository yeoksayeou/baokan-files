Xinhua News Agency, London, December 3rd (TASS dispatch): British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt, on behalf of the British Communist Party Executive Committee, sent a letter on the 1st to British Labour Party Executive Committee Secretary Philip. The original letter is as follows:

"The American reactionaries are determined not only to continue the Korean War, but also to expand the war to China. The current international situation is extremely serious, and world peace is in a precarious state. Under these circumstances, we urge the Labour Party Executive Committee to take all possible steps to ensure that Britain takes action to save world peace.

"War with China means disaster for the British people, meaning the sacrifice of thousands upon thousands of Britons and Chinese. However, without British support, the United States cannot wage war. The Labour Party Executive Committee can immediately bring peace to Korea and can stop the war against China. This is within your power. If the Labour movement takes action, it can change British policy. Let us, through the government, notify Truman that Britain intends to immediately withdraw its troops from Korea. Let the British representative at the United Nations demand that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea and demand the establishment of a unified and democratic Korea. Let Britain demand that the government of the People's Republic of China occupy its rightful place on the Security Council and declare that Britain will never participate in any military action against China under any circumstances.

"Such a declaration of a policy of peace will be quickly echoed by the best elements of mankind throughout the world. It will change the entire international situation and open up prospects for lasting world peace. I remind you that in 1920, when the reactionaries of every capitalist country were attacking the Soviet Union, when Churchill was using all his power to drag Britain into an anti-Soviet war, it was the decisive action taken by the British Labour movement that prevented such a war from happening. Undoubtedly, this brilliant demonstration of international working-class solidarity at that time changed the entire international situation. Let us use the same strength today!"

Copies of Pollitt's letter to the Labour Party Executive Committee have also been sent to the General Council of the British Trades Union Congress, the Cooperative Party, the Executive Committees of various industrial unions, Labour MPs, and local Labour Party organizations.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 4th: The British Communist Party Political Committee has called on the entire party to mobilize and organize a mass movement demanding an immediate end to the Korean War. British Communist Party Organization Secretary Kerrigan told a reporter from the London Daily Worker on the 1st: "We will do our best to explain the urgency of the war crisis to the British people and organize a powerful mass movement to stop the war."

    英共总书记波立特函英工党执委会
    要求立即从朝鲜撤回英国军队
    英共政委会号召组织群众运动要求停止朝鲜战争
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社伦敦三日讯：英国共产党总书记波立特于一日代表英国共产党执行委员会致函工党执行委员会书记菲利浦。原函如下：
    “美国反动派已经决心不仅要继续进行朝鲜战争，而且要把战争扩大到中国。目前国际局势非常严重，世界和平的处境已是千钧一发，在这种情况下，我们吁请工党执行委员会采取一切可能的步骤，以保证英国用行动来挽救世界和平。
    “与中国作战就意味着英国人民的灾难，意味着成千成万英国人和中国人的牺牲。但是，如果没有英国的支持，美国是不能进行战争的。工党执行委员会能够立刻给朝鲜带来和平，也能够阻止对中国的战争，这是你们力所能及的。劳工运动行动起来，就能使得英国的政策改变。让我们经由政府通知杜鲁门说：英国打算立即从朝鲜撤回它的军队。让英国在联合国的代表要求一切外国军队自朝鲜撤退，并要求建立统一和民主的朝鲜。让英国要求允许中华人民共和国政府在安全理事会中占有其应得的地位，并且宣布英国无论在何种情况之下都决不参与任何对中国的军事行动。
    “这样一种关于和平政策的宣言，将得到世界人类中优秀分子的迅速响应。它将改变整个国际形势，并展开持久的世界和平的前景。我提醒你们：在一九二○年，当每一个资本主义国家的反动派都在攻击苏联的时候，当邱吉尔正在使用他所有的权力把英国拉进反苏战争中的时候，正是英国劳工运动所采取的决定性的行动阻止了这类战争的发生。无疑地，那时候国际工人阶级团结一致的这一光辉的表现，改变了整个的国际形势。让我们今天使用同样的力量吧！”
    波立特致工党执行委员会函的复本，并已分致英国职工大会最高委员会，合作党，各业工会的执行委员会，工党议员和工党各地方组织。
    【新华社布拉格四日电】英国共产党政治委员会已号召全党总动员，进行组织群众运动要求立即停止朝鲜战争。英共组织部长克里根一日告伦敦工人日报记者称：“我们将全力向英国人民解释战争危机的紧迫，并组织一个强大的群众运动来阻止战争。”
