Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st—Shanghai Christian figures held the Shanghai Christian Patriotic Anti-American and Aid-Korea Action Conference on the 20th. Attendees included representatives from the National Association of the YMCA of China, the National Association of the YWCA of China, the National Christian Council of China, the Shanghai Methodist Church, the Shanghai Holy Catholic Church of China, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai YWCA, the Preachers' Association, and the Shanghai Baptist Church, including Wu Yaozong, Wu Gaozi, Tu Yuqing, Deng Yuzhi, Miao Qiusheng, Xie Songsan, You Shuxun, Yang Huaisheng, Chen Shanxiang, Tao Yong, Zhu Guangda, and others, totaling over four hundred people.

The conference began with a speech by Chairman Wu Yaozong. He emphasized that American imperialism is the greatest enemy of the Chinese people, and that after recognizing the vicious and hypocritical true face of American imperialism, Christians should rise up and wholeheartedly participate in the great movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, was also invited to speak. He used his own experiences and many true stories from churches to prove that American imperialism uses religion internally as a tool to suppress the people and externally as a tool for aggression, deception, anesthetization, and fooling. He encouraged Christian figures to complete the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, and to take practical actions to protest the insults of Austin and his ilk against the Chinese people.

Following this, Tu Yuqing and Yu Rixuan relayed the resolutions and spirit of the Shanghai People from All Circles' Anti-American and Aid-Korea, Protect the Home and Defend the Country Representative Conference. Yu Rixuan said: The movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country is a test for us, testing whether we are glorious Chinese people and whether we are faithful Christians. We firmly oppose Austin's shameless slander and those American imperialist missionaries who hang a sheep's head but sell dog meat. When American imperialism invades us, we Christians must stand with all the Chinese people and do our utmost to protect our homes and defend our country.

Next, Xie Songsan reported on the establishment of patriotic covenants and donations by various Christian organizations. Various organizations have already donated a large amount of condolence money, and the 10,000 first-aid kits to be donated will soon be completed. To strengthen national defense construction, Wu Yaozong has encouraged his son Wu Zonglan, who is studying at St. John's University, to join the military cadre school. Other Christian figures such as Chen Weiliang, Hu Zhiqing, and Zhu Yifeng have also encouraged their sons to apply for military schools. All the representatives at the conference enthusiastically approved the proposal of Pastor Wu Gaozi to establish the "Shanghai Christian Organizations' Anti-American and Aid-Korea Committee," and nominated Wu Yaozong, Wu Gaozi, Tu Yuqing, and 71 others as members.

Finally, the conference adopted the "Shanghai Christian Anti-American and Aid-Korea Patriotic Action Conference Declaration" and a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the Korean People's Army.

    上海基督教人士
    举行抗美援朝爱国行动大会
    【新华社上海二十一日电】上海基督教人士于二十日举行上海基督教抗美援朝爱国行动大会。到会的有：中华基督教青年会全国协会、中华基督教女青年会全国协会、中华基督教全国协进会、上海市基督教卫理公会、上海中华圣公会、上海基督教青年会、上海基督教女青年会、传道人联谊会、上海基督教浸礼会等团体的代表吴耀宗、吴高梓、涂羽卿、邓裕志、缪秋笙、谢颂三、尤树勋、杨怀生、陈善祥、陶庸、朱光达等四百余人。
    大会开始，首由主席吴耀宗致词。他着重说明美帝国主义是中国人民最大的敌人，基督教徒在认清了美帝狠毒伪善的真面目后，就应该起来全心全力参加抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动。
    中央人民政府内务部副部长陈其瑗也应邀讲话。他以亲身经历及许多教会里的真人真事，证明美帝利用宗教对内作为镇压人民的工具，对外作为侵略、欺骗、麻醉、愚弄的工具。他勉励基督教人士完成自治、自养、自传的三自运动，以实际行动抗议奥斯汀之流对中国人民的侮辱。
    接着由涂羽卿、余日宣传达上海各界抗美援朝保家卫国代表大会的决议和精神。余日宣说：抗美援朝保家卫国运动是给我们一次考验，考验我们是不是光荣的中国人民，考验我们是不是一个忠实的基督教徒。我们坚决反对奥斯汀的无耻谰言，反对那些挂羊头卖狗肉的美帝传教士。当美帝侵略到我们面前时，我们基督教徒要和全中国人民站在一起，为保家卫国尽最大的力量。
    继由谢颂三报告基督教各团体订立爱国公约及捐献情况。各团体已捐献大宗慰劳款，准备捐献的一万个救护袋也即将完成。为增强国防建设，吴耀宗已鼓励他在圣约翰大学读书的儿子吴宗兰参加军事干校，其他基督教人士陈卫亮，胡知清，朱逸峰等也都鼓励了自己的儿子投考军事学校。大会全体代表热烈赞同吴高梓牧师的提议，成立了“上海基督教团体抗美援朝委员会”，并推定吴耀宗、吴高梓、涂羽卿等七十一人为委员。
    大会最后通过了“上海基督教抗美援朝爱国行动大会宣言”及向毛主席、中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军致敬电。
