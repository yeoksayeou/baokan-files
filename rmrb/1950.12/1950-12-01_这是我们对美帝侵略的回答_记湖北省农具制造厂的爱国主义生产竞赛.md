    “This is Our Answer to American Imperialist Aggression”
    – On the Patriotic Production Competition at the Hubei Province Farm Implement Factory
      Li Wen
    In mid-November, I visited the Hubei Province Mechanical Farm Reclamation Department's Farm Implement Factory, where a fervent patriotic production competition was underway.

    Walking into each workshop, every production action – the lathe spinning rapidly, the hammer flying up and down, the fitter intently focused on every tiny part – filled you with a sense of intense production. The workers cherished time so much that even when the quitting bell rang, many were reluctant to stop working. Before the starting bell rang, many workers were already in the workshops, organizing their tools and preparing to start work. On Saturday evenings, many young workers enthusiastically learned skills from the technicians. This demonstrated not only the young workers' eagerness to learn but also the older technicians' deep concern for the country. The factory was busily drawing up apprenticeship contracts. On one wall newspaper, I saw the full text of the apprenticeship contract signed by technician Gao Guangwen and young worker Chen Yuanyu, beginning with: "In order to enable young workers to improve their skills faster, to provide our new China with more technical personnel, and to strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, this apprenticeship contract is hereby established." Below were the contract's duration, the content of the teaching, the specific steps and methods of teaching, and the young worker's determination and conditions for learning. The production record sheets of each workshop best demonstrated the progress of the patriotic production competition. I casually looked at the individual production record sheets of sand molders Zhang Xiaosong and Li Huaqing in the sand molding workshop. Both were manufacturing water gates for roads, working nine hours a day. On the 15th, Zhang Xiaosong's production achievement was nineteen, while Li Huaqing's was twenty. On the 16th, both increased to twenty-four. On the 17th, Zhang Xiaosong further increased to thirty-five, and Li Huaqing reached thirty-six. Zhu Chengchun, the labor model and group leader of the sand molding workshop, told me: "There are four people in the sand molding workshop making water gates. Initially, the first day, they made sixteen to eighteen. By the fourth day (the 17th), the highest was thirty-six, two people made thirty-five, and another made thirty-three. Compared to the first day, production efficiency increased by 80 percent. Out of the two hundred and twenty water gates made, only two were damaged, a scrap rate of 0.9 percent. Technician Gao Junfeng made water gate covers, originally planning seven minutes per piece. On the 17th, he made sixty in four working hours, averaging only four minutes per piece. Xia Mingwang, who manufactures powered rice hullers, consistently took sixty working hours to make one unit in September and October. After the patriotic production competition began, he improved the production method, requiring only thirty-four working hours and saving sixty jin of charcoal. The sand molding workshop has eleven technicians and four apprentices, all mobilized. Since the competition began on November 4th, they have saved over four hundred working hours in half a month. This is our practical action to resist America and aid Korea; this is the answer of our working class to American imperialist aggression." Similar new production records also appeared in various workshops. Workers in the fitter workshop improved the drilling of transverse pinholes for water gate boxes through diligent study of technology and improvement of production tools, doubling efficiency from fifteen minutes to eight minutes. Long Letian in the turner workshop increased the production of sprayer nozzles from fifteen minutes to eight minutes per piece. Hu Kerong in the baking workshop, making rice milling machine buckets, originally took twelve hours per piece. By improving the production method, he made seven in four days (thirty-six working hours). Before the competition, Liu Pinqing made one sprayer cylinder per hour; now he only needs forty-five minutes.

    When the workers heard that the United States was expanding its aggression in Korea, seriously threatening China's security, workers in various workshops used their daily study time to discuss the development of the situation. At a current affairs discussion in the sand molding workshop, young worker Wen Xuebin declared his determination passionately: "When I heard that the American imperialists were occupying Taiwan and frantically bombing the Northeast, I was furious. I am determined not to be oppressed by the Chiang bandits again. The American imperialists are ruthless wolves. They don't listen to good words. If you don't beat the wolf, the wolf will bite you! I used to be in the army; I want to join the Volunteer Army to aid Korea." Wen Xuebin is a 25-year-old youth from Hanchuan County, Hubei Province. His father died early, and he, his mother, and his younger brother farmed two or three acres of poor land. When he was fourteen, the crops failed, and they couldn't pay the grain tax. The puppet village chief imprisoned his mother, and he was beaten. Unable to bear the torture of the landlords and village chiefs, he joined the New Fourth Army in 1942. Later, he returned home from the army due to severe illness. At that time, the New Fourth Army had been forced to withdraw north, and Wen Xuebin's family was even more miserable. The Chiang bandits conscripted him three times, but he cleverly escaped each time. He dared not return home and wandered in the countryside all year round. It was not until Hubei was liberated that he found his former leader in the New Fourth Army, who introduced him to the farm implement factory to learn a trade. From then on, he had a job and a future. Wen Xuebin's accusations evoked painful memories from every worker. The contrast between the old and new societies made everyone's heart clearer. Everyone had a common will: "We cannot let the American imperialists follow the old path of Japanese aggression against China; we must resolutely protect our good life." The master workers encouraged Wen Xuebin: "You young people shed blood on the front lines; we will intensify production in the rear to increase the strength of the country."

    At the meeting, veteran technician Xia Mingwang did not speak, but he was struggling fiercely internally. In the old society, he had worked for nineteen years, traveling to more than a dozen sand molding factories. He had repeatedly suffered the pain of unemployment. When he was working as a technician in a sand molding factory in Hankou in 1946, his daily wage could only buy two packs of cigarettes. The workers were so hungry that they couldn't bear it any longer. More than 300 sand molding workers in the city elected representatives to petition the factory for a wage increase. The factory bribed the reactionary government and detained him and several other representatives. After he was released, a dozen workers pooled their resources to start a small sand molding factory, but they couldn't withstand the price fluctuations at the time. They sold goods but couldn't buy them back; they had little capital and couldn't manage. Before long, it collapsed, and he lost his job again. After liberation, he came to work at the farm implement factory. He keenly felt that workers were respected for the first time. In the past, the factory director used a car to enter and exit, and the workers were not allowed to meet him. Now, the factory director often discussed production plans with the workers. What made him even happier was that he no longer had to worry about unemployment. But some time ago, he had been moody because he was dissatisfied with his wages and even thought: "The money is in your pocket, but the skills are in my hands. You can't get a good deal on me." At this time, Xia Mingwang was extremely remorseful, thinking of the life of a beast of burden in the old society, which must not be repeated. Now production is for one's own factory and country, so why not work harder? Although he did not speak at the meeting, he resolved to muster his strength to increase production. His task was to manufacture powered rice hullers. Because of his skill, he had already reduced the time it took to make one unit from nine days in August and September to seven days (sixty-three working hours). He was still not satisfied and carefully studied every detail of the sand molding process, finally coming up with an improved method. He made wooden crosshairs and "rib edges" and other production tools to replace manual production, greatly increasing production efficiency and requiring only thirty-four working hours to manufacture a rice huller.

    Zhang Guangmei, a technician in the turner workshop, who usually did not like to talk, also took active action.

    Zhang Guangmei had been working in factories since he was sixteen. For thirty years, he had moved from this factory to that factory, his two black hands working non-stop, but he had always been half-hungry. He was extremely resentful of the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialism. When he thought that the superiors might not allow him, an old worker in his forties, to go to the Korean front, he felt somewhat depressed. The union's call reminded him: "Every worker is a combatant; doing one more job is equivalent to eliminating one enemy." So, Zhang Guangmei put all his energy into the lathe. A few days ago, he had a cold and his whole body ached, but he supported himself and worked as usual without taking sick leave. He actively improved his skills. In September, it took sixteen hours to turn a hydraulic press head; now it only takes ten hours. In the past, it took twenty-seven working hours to turn a rice huller; now it only takes seventeen working hours, increasing production efficiency by 40 percent.

    On Saturday evening, Zhang Guangmei went home. His seventeen-year-old daughter (who works in the People's Bank) told him that her colleagues at the bank had volunteered one day of unpaid labor to express their determination to resist America and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend their country and to strengthen national defense. Zhang Guangmei said, "That's right! The People's Volunteer Army is shedding blood on the Korean front, and we in the rear are afraid of sacrificing some of our rest time." When he returned to the factory, he excitedly proposed to the workers in the turner workshop that they not rest on Sunday and contribute one day of unpaid labor. He immediately received the enthusiastic support of all the workers in the workshop. The news spread to other workshops, and soon more than eighty people in the factory signed up for voluntary labor.

    As I left the Hubei Province Farm Implement Factory, I silently recalled what I had seen and heard in the past few days, which made me deeply feel that the workers' patriotic enthusiasm was reflected in every occasion in the farm implement factory. This proves a truth: The awakened Chinese people are not to be trifled with!

    “这是我们对美帝侵略的回答”
    ——记湖北省农具制造厂的爱国主义生产竞赛
      力文
    十一月中旬，我访问了湖北省机械农垦处农具制造厂，全厂正热烈开展着爱国主义生产竞赛。
    走进每一个车间，从每一个生产动作中——车床急速地旋转，铁锤上下翻飞，钳工工人聚精会神地注意着每一个细小的机件，都使你体会到一种紧张生产的气息。工人们是这样的珍惜时间：下班钟响了，还看见不少人恋恋不舍地工作着；当上班钟还未响的时候，不少工人已走进车间，开始整理工具，准备上班了。星期六晚上，还有许多青年工人在热心地跟技工们学习业务。这一方面是青工们学习情绪高，另方面也是老技工们热切关怀祖国的表现。厂子里正纷纷订立师徒合同，在一块墙报上，我看到技工高光稳与青工陈怨宇所订师徒合同的全文，开头写着：“为了使青工更快地提高技术，使我们的新中国多出一个技术人员，增强抗美援朝保家卫国的力量，特订立师徒合同”。下面是合同的期限、教学的内容、教学的具体步骤与方法，以及青工学习的决心和条件。最具体表现出爱国主义生产竞赛进展情形的，是各车间的生产纪录表。我曾在翻砂间顺便翻看翻砂工张小松和李华清的个人生产纪录表。他们两人都在制造着马路上用的水门，每天是九小时的工作。十五日张小松的生产成绩是十九个，李华清为二十个；十六日，两个人都增至二十四个，十七日张小松又增至三十五个，李华清已增至三十六个了。翻砂间组长劳动模范朱成春告诉我：“翻砂间共有四个人制造水门，开始第一天是十六个到十八个，到第四天（十七日）最高的为三十六个，两个人是三十五个，另一人是三十三个了，与第一天比较，生产效率便提高了百分之八十；已做好的二百二十个水门中，共损坏了两个，报废率为千分之九。技工高俊峰做水门盖子，原计划七分钟一个，十七日四个工时做出六十个，只合四分钟一个。制造动力砻谷机的夏明望，九、十月份一直是六十个工时做一部，爱国主义生产竞赛后，他改良了制作法，只需用三十四个工时，还可节省六十斤木炭。翻砂间有十一个技工，四个学徒，全部动员起来了，自十一月四日竞赛开始，半个月时间，节省工时四百多个。这就是我们抗美援朝的实际行动，这是我们工人阶级对美帝侵略的回答。”类似的生产新纪录，也在各个车间出现。钳工间工人钻制水门盒子的横梢眼，因认真钻研技术，改善了制作工具，效率提高一倍，由十五分钟减至八分钟，车工间龙乐天制喷雾器嘴子，由十五分钟提高到八分钟一个。烤工间胡克荣，做碾米机斗子，原定工时是十二小时一个，由于改进制作法，四天（三十六个工时）造了七个。刘品卿竞赛前，一小时做一个喷雾器筒，现在只用四十五分钟了。
    当工人们听到美国扩大侵略朝鲜，严重威胁我国安全的时候，各车间的工人，利用每天的学习时间，座谈时局的发展。在翻砂间一次时事座谈会上，青工文学彬激昂地宣布了自己的决心：“听说美帝侵占台湾，疯狂轰炸东北，我便气炸了，我是决心不再受蒋匪的欺压了；美帝是狠心狼，说好话他不听，你不打狼，狼便咬你！我过去参加过军队，我要参加援朝志愿军。”文学彬是一个二十五岁的青年，老家是湖北汉川县人，父亲死的早，他和母亲、弟弟种着二、三亩薄田，十四岁那年，庄稼没收成，交不上粮，伪保长把他母亲关在监牢里，他挨了打。受不住地主、保长的折磨，一九四二年他便参加了新四军，后来又因病重从队伍上回家。当时，新四军已被迫北撤，文学彬一家更悲惨了。蒋匪抓他三次壮丁，都被他机警地跑掉了，他有家不敢归，终年流浪在四乡。直到湖北解放，他找到原来在新四军时的首长，由部队介绍到农具厂学技术，从此，他有了职业和前途。文学彬的控诉，引起每个工友苦痛的回忆，新旧社会的对比，使每个人心里更亮堂了。大家有着一个共同的意志：“不能让美帝走日寇侵略中国的老路，要坚决保住自己的好日子”。老师傅们鼓励着文学彬：“你们年青人，到前方拚命流血，我们在后方，一定加紧生产，增加国家的力量。”
    在会上，老技工夏明望没有发言，他内心在激烈地斗争着。在旧社会他做了十九年工，走遍了十几个翻砂工厂，他一次又一次地遭到失业的苦痛。当一九四六年他在汉口一家翻砂工厂当技工的时候，一天工资只能买到两包香烟，工人们饿得没办法，全市三百多翻砂工人，推选代表向厂方请愿，要求增加工资，厂方贿通了反动政府，把他和另外几个代表扣押起来，出来后，十几个工友集资办一个小型翻砂厂，但经不起当时的物价波动，卖出去买不进来，资金少周转不开，没好久，便倒闭了，他也从此失了业。解放后，他来到农具制造厂做工，他敏锐地感到工人第一次被尊重，过去的厂长是包车进包车出，工人们不得和他见面，现在的厂长却常常和工人们在一起商量着订生产计划。更使他高兴的，是再也不耽心失业了。可是前些时，他却因工资的不如意，在闹情绪，甚至还想到：“钱在你腰包里，本领在我身上，你买不了我的便宜。”此时，夏明望懊悔极了，想到旧社会的牛马生活，万不能再重复了；现在生产是为了自己的工厂和国家，为什么还不加劲生产呢？他虽然没有在会上发言，却决心鼓足劲增加生产。他的任务是制造动力砻谷机，因为他技术的熟练，已由八、九月份的九天做一部减至七天（六十三个工时）做一个了，他仍不满足，细心的钻研着翻砂过程中的每个细节，终于想出了改进办法，制成木制十字线和“筋边”等制作工具，来代替手工制作，大大增加了生产效率，只需三十四个工时，便制造出一部砻谷机了。
    车工间技工张光美，平素不爱讲说，现在也积极行动起来了。
    张光美从十六岁进工厂，三十年来从这厂转到那厂，两只黑手不停地做工，却一直是半饥半饱，对国民党反动派和帝国主义极端愤恨。他转念到上级可能不允许他这四十多岁的老工人去朝鲜前线的时候，他有些苦闷了。工会的号召提醒了他：“我们每个工人都是战斗员，多做一件活，便等于消灭一个敌人”于是张光美一股劲用到车床上了。前几天，他患伤风，浑身酸疼，他撑着腰照常工作，不请病假，他积极地改进技术，九月份车一个轧油机机头需十六个小时，现在只需十个小时了，过去车好一个砻谷机需要二十七个工时，现在只用十七个工时，提高生产效率百分之四十。
    星期六的晚上，张光美回家了。十七岁的女儿（在人民银行工作）告诉他，她们银行的同志，为表示抗美援朝保家卫国的决心，每个人自愿献出义务劳动一天，来增强国防力量。张光美说：“对呀！人民志愿部队在朝鲜前线流血，咱们在后方，还能怕牺牲些自己的休息时间”，他回到工厂的时候，兴奋地向车工间工友提出星期日不休息，贡献一天义务劳动的建议，立刻获得全车间工友的热烈赞成。消息传到其他车间，很快地全厂有八十多人报名做义务工。
    当我离开湖北省农具制造厂的时候，我默默地回忆着几天来的见闻，使我深切感到：在农具制造厂的任何场合里，都体现出工人们爱国主义的热情。这证明着一个真理：觉悟了的中国人民，是不可轻侮的！
