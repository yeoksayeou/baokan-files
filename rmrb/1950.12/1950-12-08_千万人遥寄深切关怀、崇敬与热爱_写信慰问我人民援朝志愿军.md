Millions Remotely Send Deep Care, Respect and Love
Writing Letters to Comfort Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

[Report from our newspaper] After the news came last month that our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting alongside the Korean People's Army, had achieved victory, the people of the whole country were overjoyed, and a wave of comfort activities sprang up in various places. Sending comfort bags and writing letters of support has become a magnificent mass movement among people from all walks of life. Hundreds of letters of support are sent to our editorial department every day, entrusted to be forwarded to the Korean front lines, with the signatures of thousands of people. After our newspaper published the news on December 2nd that our volunteer forces and the Korean People's Army launched a counter-offensive on the east and west lines in North Korea, smashing MacArthur's "general offensive," the people in Beijing and across the country became even more excited, and the number of letters of support sent to our newspaper to be forwarded to the front increased daily. More than 300 faculty, staff, and students of the Russian Language School in Beijing, in addition to holding a grand celebration at 1:30 pm on the 2nd, signed their names on a large piece of red silk and wrote a letter to the heroes on the front lines saying, "You smashed the so-called 'general offensive' launched by the American imperialists, recovered vast territories of Korea, and are pursuing and annihilating the enemy. We are extremely happy. In addition to vowing to be your rear support, we extend our heartfelt and respectful greetings to you!"

The letters of support came from major and minor cities and vast rural areas across the country, from Harbin in the northeast to Guangzhou in South China, and even Hong Kong; from Yantai on the east coast to Lanzhou in the northwest and Ulanhot in Inner Mongolia. The people writing letters included commanders and soldiers of the army, workers, farmers, government cadres, professors, faculty, staff, and students of universities and secondary and primary schools, scientific workers, literary and art workers, medical workers, and people from other walks of life. There were also housewives, children, and elderly people in their seventies. They all expressed their deep condolences to the heroes on the Korean front lines and expressed their high respect for the heroic and righteous actions of volunteering to aid Korea. Many combat heroes of the army, navy, and air force said, "We are determined to intensify our studies, improve our military skills, and support you by rapidly strengthening our national defense forces." Heroes such as explosion heroes Li Ming and Zhao Shoufu also expressed their desire to go to Korea and blow the American aggressors to smithereens. The commanders and soldiers of the troops, such as all the commanders and soldiers of an engineering company, said in their letter of support: "You are bravely fighting the enemy on the Korean front, and we are determined to eliminate bandits and clear out special agents in the rear of the motherland to consolidate social order."

Labor models from all over the country expressed in their letters of support that they are determined to do a good job in preventing spies and special agents, stepping up production, and strengthening economic power to support the warriors on the Korean front in eliminating the American aggressors. Li Yong, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, said in his letter of support: "In order to support you, we have launched patriotic production competitions in the rear. Our railway workers have launched an over-axle movement to haul more and run faster without accidents. Our Mao Zedong locomotive exceeded its axle load by more than 3,000 tons in November. We will use these practical actions to support you." Special-class labor hero Li Yonglu, 132 labor models from Hunyuan County, Chahar Province, and Wang Zemin, a livestock model from Taiping Village, Yongji County, Jilin Province, who attended the National Labor Model Conference, also expressed the same sentiments in their letters and wished the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea an early triumphant return.

Representative conferences from various circles in counties and districts in many regions of Central South China, Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan also wrote letters to comfort our People's Volunteer Army, expressing their intention to support the Korean people and our Volunteer Army by working hard to produce, actively handing in public grain, and completing land reform. The letter of support from the Second Session of the People's Representatives Conference of Fanshi County, Shanxi, stated: "In the name of the conference, we call on the people of the whole county to work hard to produce, actively hand in public grain, strengthen national defense forces, and, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely serve as your rear support."

The letters of support from teachers and students of universities, secondary and primary schools, and other cadre training classes were the most numerous. For example, Beijing Municipal Third Middle School, Ninth Middle School, and the Central Film Bureau's projection class sent 200-300 letters at a time. Every letter was filled with encouragement for victory and concern for the warriors of the Chinese and Korean peoples, as well as extreme hatred for American imperialism. Many students also firmly stated in their letters of support that in addition to actively participating in the propaganda work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, they are ready to respond to any call from the motherland at any time. Feng Chenglin, a 53-year-old professor at Normal University, recounted in his letter that he had cultivated talents in various fields for the motherland in his position as an educator for many years. In the future, he will adhere to his position even more closely and devote greater efforts to the people's education cause. He also said, "Now that I am older, I am afraid that fighting directly is not helpful; but as long as there is a need for my work, I will definitely go to your side to do the work I can do." Up to now, in addition to the major universities and middle schools in Beijing that have successively written letters of support to the Volunteer Army, other institutions such as Tianjin Hebei Institute of Technology, Tianjin Municipal Midwifery School, Henan University, Nanjing University, Hebei Provincial Dingxian Normal School, Hebei Provincial Huangcun Agricultural Vocational School, Handan Special District Women's Normal School, Handan Middle School, Shanxi University School of Medicine, Shanxi Provincial Pingyao Middle School, Shandong Provincial Yidu Middle School, Shanghai Municipal Twenty-first Workers' Night School, and dozens of other schools have successively delivered letters of support to our newspaper's editorial department, requesting them to be forwarded to the Chinese and Korean people's soldiers on the Korean front. The letters were filled with love and concern for the great motherland and the people's heroes, as well as hatred for American imperialism. The letter from the Student Union of Shand Da Medical College stated: "Our four hundred and eighty young and boiling hearts at Shand Da Medical College are blessing you with health and celebrating your victory!" The letter from all the students of Henan University said: "Under the banner of opposing aggression, defending peace, and striving for independence and freedom, we wish you the liberation of every inch of land belonging to the Korean people!" The children of the cadre's children's school of the 15th Corps and the children's team of Shilou Primary School in Dexian County, Shandong, in addition to writing letters of support, also saved their fruit money as comfort money, saying innocently: "Send it to you to buy bullets to shoot American devils."

There were also many letters of support from mass organizations such as literary federations, women's federations, music associations, and federations of industry and commerce from all over the country. Literary and art workers stated that they would strive to create literary and art works in various forms, using them to expose the aggressive atrocities and ugliness of American imperialism. Many women and female workers, because they hate war and love peace, actively support our People's Volunteer Army who are going to Korea to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Many mothers wrote letters to encourage their sons who had already gone to Korea to work hard to kill the enemy. For example, Jiang Suhui of the Beijing Construction Bureau received a letter and photo from her son Shao Xun before his departure. The photo was inscribed with "Leave a permanent memento for mother." She wrote back, "After reading your letter, I know that your will to kill the enemy is even more firm, and I feel infinitely happy, but why didn't you clearly express it in your words? Are you afraid that I wouldn't agree? Child! You are wrong! I will never be selfish, I will love my motherland with the same feeling as I love my son. Today, you can go to the forefront of the anti-aggression battle to defend the motherland, how comforted and glorious I should be!" Also, Wu Guoqing, a student at Shenyang Sixth Middle School who had signed up to join the military academy, received a letter from her mother saying: "Child! Drive the American devils out and inherit your father's legacy and carry out the revolution to the end. Don't worry about me, someone has planted our land for us, and the government is taking good care of me. Child! Go quickly! It is glorious to bravely go to the front line for the people and the country." Wang Jiangxue of the Beijing Workers and Peasants Rapid Training Middle School's teacher training class wrote a letter saying: "We must bury the imperialists in the grave, let the children grow up peacefully, and let mothers no longer worry about the lives of their husbands or sons because of the war." Many female workers and female teachers in Jinan, Xi'an, Yangzhou, and northern Jiangsu also wrote letters of support to our People's Volunteer Army. In addition to the federations of industry and commerce in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan that have sent letters of support, federations of industry and commerce in many small cities such as Anxiang in Hunan and Zhumadian in Henan have also written letters of support.

As news of victories from the Korean front continues to pour in, the number of letters of support our newspaper receives is increasing daily. The people of the whole country are encouraged by the successive victories, and even elderly people in their seventies and eighties are writing letters to comfort our People's Volunteer Army. Xu Ziyan, a resident of No. 17 Yueyahu Alley, Dongsi North, wrote in his letter: "I am already seventy-four years old, and I regret that I cannot go to the battlefield to kill a few American devils to relieve the hatred in my heart. Now I can only lead my family to make some cold-proof items for you, which can also be regarded as contributing a part of my strength in fighting the American devils." This is how enthusiastically and actively the people of the whole country are supporting the Chinese and Korean people's heroes on the Korean front.

Thousands of comfort bags,
Thousands of letters of support,
Thousands of Chinese people's hearts of admiration and love,
Dedicated to the brave warriors on the Korean front!
Bravely advance south,
Continue to advance south,
To Seoul, to the seaside,
Our hearts will always follow you! (With picture)

    千万人遥寄深切关怀、崇敬与热爱
    写信慰问我人民援朝志愿军
    【本报讯】上月中，我国人民抗美援朝志愿部队与朝人民军并肩作战获得胜利的消息传来后，全国人民欢欣鼓舞，各地先后掀起了慰问热潮；送慰劳袋、写慰问信已在各界人民中形成了一个波澜壮阔的群众性运动。仅寄到本报编辑部来，托代转朝鲜前线的慰问信每日即达数百件，签名人数达数千人。在本报于本月二日发表了我志愿部队与朝鲜人民军在朝北东西两线发动反攻击溃麦克阿瑟“总攻势”的消息后，京市以及全国各地人民益加振奋，投寄本报托转前方的慰问信更日有增加。京市俄文专修学校的全体干学人员三百余人，除了在二日下午一时半举行了盛大的庆祝会外，并以大红绸子一幅签名写信给前线的英雄们说：“你们击溃了美帝发动的所谓‘总攻势’，收复了朝鲜广大国土，并正在追歼和聚歼敌军，我们高兴极了。我们除发誓做你们的后盾外，并对你们致以感激的亲切的敬礼！”
    慰问信来自全国的各大中小城市和广大农村，从东北的哈尔滨市到华南的广州、乃至香港；从东海岸的烟台市到西北的兰州再到内蒙古的乌兰浩特市，写信的人包括了部队指战员、工人、农民、机关干部、大中小学的教授、教职员、学生、科学工作者、文艺工作者、医务工作者，以及其他各阶层人民。还有家庭妇女、有儿童、有七十多岁的老年人。他们一致对朝鲜前线的英雄们致以深切的慰问，并对英雄们志愿援朝的正义行动表示崇高的敬意。许多陆、海、空军的战斗英雄们说：“我们决心加紧学习，提高军事技术，为迅速增强国防力量来支援你们。”如爆炸英雄李明、赵守福等并表示要到朝鲜去，把美国侵略者炸个血肉横飞。部队的指战员们，如某部工兵连的全体指战员则在慰问信中说：“你们在朝鲜前方奋勇杀敌，我们在祖国后方坚决消灭土匪、肃清特务以巩固社会治安。”
    各地的劳动模范们在慰问信中都表示，决心以搞好防奸防特，加紧生产，增强经济力量来支援朝鲜前线的勇士们消灭美国侵略者。毛泽东号机车司机长李永在慰问信中说：“我们为支援你们，在后方都展开了爱国生产竞赛。我们铁路工人展开了超轴运动，要多拉快跑，不出事故。我们毛泽东号机车十一月份共超轴三千多吨。我们就拿这些实际行动来支援你们。”特等劳动英雄李永禄、察省浑源县的一百三十二名劳模、吉林永吉县太平村出席全国劳模大会的畜牧模范王泽民等亦在信中作同样的表示，并祝中国人民抗美援朝志愿军的同志们早日凯旋归来。
    中南各地及河北、山西、绥远等地不少地区的县、区各界代表会，也都纷纷写信慰问我国人民志愿部队，表示将以努力生产，积极交纳公粮，完成土改来支援朝鲜人民和我志愿部队。山西繁峙县二届各界人民代表大会的慰问信中即说：“我们以大会的名义号召全县人民，努力生产，积极交纳公粮，加强国防力量，和全国人民一道，坚决作你们的后盾。”
    各大中小学及其他干训班师生的慰问信，数量最多。如北京市立三中、九中及中央电影局放映班等校一次即送来二、三百件。每一封信里都充满着对胜利的鼓舞和对中朝两国人民勇士们的关怀，以及对美帝国主义的极端仇恨。许多同学并在慰问信中坚决表示，除了积极参加抗美援朝的宣传工作外，并随时准备响应祖国的任何号召。师大五十三岁的老教授冯成麟在信中叙述了他多年来在教育工作者的岗位上为祖国培植了一些各方面的建设人才。今后更要紧守岗位，为人民的教育事业尽更大的力量。他又说：“现在我的年龄大些了，直接打仗怕是不济事了；但是只要需要我工作，我一定到你们那边去做能做的工作。”到目前为止，除了京市各大、中学先后给志愿部队写了慰问信外，其他如天津河北工学院、天津市立助产学校、河南大学、南京大学、河北省立定县师范、河北省立黄村农职、邯郸专区女子师范、邯郸中学、山西大学医学院、山西省立平遥中学、山东省立益都中学、上海市立第二十一工人夜校等数十个学校的全体师生，都先后把慰问信交到本报编辑部来，要求代转朝鲜前方中朝两国人民将士，信中洋溢着对于伟大祖国与人民英雄们的热爱和关切，也充满着对美帝国主义的切齿痛恨，如山大医学院学生会的信中说：“我们山大医学院四百八十颗年青沸腾的心，在祝福你们健康，庆祝你们的胜利！”河南大学全体同学的来信中说：“在反对侵略、保卫和平、争取独立自由的旗帜下，预祝你们解放朝鲜人民自己的每一寸土地！”十五兵团干部子弟学校及山东德县石芦小学的少年儿童队的小朋友们，除了写了慰问信外，并将水果钱省下来作为慰劳金，天真地说：“送给你们买子弹打美国鬼子。”
    来自各地文联、妇联、音协、工商联等群众团体的慰问信也很多，文艺工作者们表示将努力从事创作各种形式的文艺作品，通过它们来揭露美帝的侵略暴行和丑恶。许多妇女们、女工们，由于她们憎恨战争、热爱和平，积极支援赴朝抗美的我人民志愿部队。许多母亲写信鼓励她已经赴朝的儿子努力杀敌。如京市建设局的蒋素辉接到她儿子绍循出发前寄给她的信和照片，照片上写着“给母亲留永远的纪念”，她回信时写着：“看了你的信，知道你杀敌的意志更坚定了，我感到无限的欢欣，但是，你为什么不明白表现在字里行间呢？怕我不同意吗？孩子！错误了啊！我决不自私，我会以爱儿子的心情爱我的祖国。今日你为了保卫祖国，你能走上反侵略战斗的最前线，我该是如何的安慰，如何的光荣啊！”又沈阳第六中学已报名参加军校的武国卿同学接到她母亲的信说：“孩子！把美国鬼子打出去，承继你父亲的遗志，革命到底。不要顾虑我，咱们的地有人给种了，政府对我照顾的很周到。孩子！快去吧！为人民、为国家而英勇地走上前线是很光荣的。”京工农速成中学师资训练班王绛雪写信说：“我们一定要把帝国主义者打进坟墓里去，让孩子们平安地长大，让母亲们不再因战争而为她的丈夫或儿子的生命担忧。”济南、西安、扬州及苏北等地也有不少女工、女教师给我人民志愿军写了慰问信。工商界除京、津、沪、汉等大城市工商联曾经致函慰问外，许多小城市如湖南安乡、河南驻马店等地的工商联亦写信慰问和支援。
    随着朝鲜前线的胜利频传，本报每日收到的慰问函日有增加，全国人民都为接二连三的胜利消息所鼓舞，年已七八十岁的老年人也毫无例外地写信慰问我人民志愿军。京东四北月牙胡同十七号的住户徐梓岩即在信中说：“我已七十四岁了，恨我不能到战场上杀死几个美国鬼子，以解我胸中之恨。现在我只有领导家中为你们做些防寒物品，也算在打美国鬼子中尽一分力量。”全国的人民就是这样热情、积极地支援着朝鲜前线的中朝人民英雄们。
    千万个慰问袋，
    千万封慰问信，
    千万颗中国人民钦敬热爱的心，
    献给朝鲜前线英勇的战士们！
    英勇向南挺进，
    继续向南挺进，
    到汉城，到海滨，
    我们的心永远跟随着你们！（附图片）
