    The first women's representative conferences of Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces were held last month. Both provincial conferences decided to strengthen the political education of women, mobilize women to participate in winter schools, and organize all women to participate in patriotic production and construction. The Suiyuan Women's Conference also emphasized the need to mobilize women to participate in work such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, suppression of bandits and special agents, and rural political construction. Both conferences elected and established provincial democratic women's federations.
    Shanghai held its third student representative conference on the 9th and 10th of this month, with 1,256 representatives from 357 schools attending. The conference proposed that the central task of students in the city is to actively respond to the call of the motherland, join military cadre schools, and strengthen national defense. Many parents of students who attended the conference encouraged their children to dedicate themselves to national defense.
    The Central Cultural Service Troupe of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League arrived in Jiangxi on the 30th of last month and launched literary and artistic propaganda activities. They successively performed short plays and movies about land reform and resisting America and aiding Korea in rural areas such as Hengfeng and Yiyang counties in Shangrao District, where land reform is underway. The troupe arrived in Nanchang on the 11th and is expected to perform for ten days before going to the old revolutionary base areas in southwestern Jiangxi during the land revolution era to carry out activities.
