Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, December 20th: Following the Brussels meeting of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the Danish Communist Party issued a declaration calling on the Danish people to support the demand for the entire Germany to become a demilitarized and democratic nation, in order to safeguard Danish interests. The declaration pointed out: The Danish government declared in 1947 that "Denmark is particularly concerned about the complete disarmament and elimination of militarism in Germany," but now "the Danish government and the governments of other Atlantic Treaty nations have agreed to the American war policy," enabling German militarism to be revived under the command of Nazi officers. The declaration emphasized: "The major powers should begin negotiations based on the Soviet Union's proposals and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. This is beneficial to Denmark."

    丹共号召人民维护丹麦利益
    【新华社二十四日讯】据电通社哥本哈根二十日讯，丹麦共产党在北大西洋侵略集团布鲁塞尔会议发表公报后发出宣言，号召丹麦人民支持使整个德国成为非军事化的民主国家的要求，以维护丹麦的利益。宣言指出：丹麦政府在一九四七年曾宣布“丹麦对德国全部解除武装及肃清军国主义一事特别关切”，但现在“丹麦政府和其他大西洋公约国的政府却同意美国的战争政策”，使德国军国主义在纳粹军官指挥下复活。宣言强调：“各大国应以苏联的建议为基础，开始谈判，缔结对德和约。这是对丹麦有利的。”
