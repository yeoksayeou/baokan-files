(Xinhua News Agency, December 15th) A comprehensive TASS dispatch from New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met on December 12th and 13th to continue discussing the slanderous case of accusing the People's Republic of China of interfering in Korea.

    At the beginning of the meeting on the 12th, Indian representative Rau presented two new proposals on behalf of several national delegations.

    The first proposal was submitted on behalf of the thirteen-nation delegation – Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen. This proposal suggested that it should be noted that "steps must be taken immediately to prevent the Korean War from spreading to other regions, to end the war in Korea; and then further actions should be taken to peacefully resolve all existing problems in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations." The proposal also stipulated that the United Nations General Assembly request the President of the Assembly, Andie, to form a group of three, including himself, to determine the basis on which a ceasefire in Korea could be satisfactorily achieved, and to submit recommendations to the General Assembly as quickly as possible.

    The other proposal was submitted on behalf of the twelve countries mentioned above, excluding the Philippines. This proposal requested that the United Nations General Assembly recommend that representatives of the governments of the following countries (a blank space was left here in the proposal to be filled in after a decision is made) hold a meeting as soon as possible to formulate recommendations for the peaceful settlement of existing problems in the Far East in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

    Rau informed the Political Committee of the results of his meeting with Wu Xiuquan, the representative of the Central People's Government of China, who is currently in New York. Rau said that the Chinese representative assured me that the Central People's Government of China does not need war and hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War. However, the government is anxiously watching the military operations of the American troops approaching the Chinese border. According to Rau, the representative of the People's Republic of China also raised the issue of Taiwan, which is currently occupied by American troops. The Indian representative informed the representative of the Central People's Government of China that the Indian government believes that the Taiwan issue should be resolved in accordance with the Cairo and Potsdam agreements, which stipulate that Taiwan must be returned to China.

    Rau proposed that the following countries should be mentioned in the second proposal: the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, India, and Egypt. Representatives of these countries should immediately meet to formulate recommendations for the peaceful settlement of existing disputes in the Far East. Rau also proposed that the Political Committee should immediately begin discussing the above proposals. The Indian proposal was supported by Yugoslavia, Australia, and Syria.

    Soviet representative Malik opposed changing the order of deliberation on these issues because the Soviet delegation did not consider the thirteen-nation proposal to have any priority. Malik suggested that all proposals be discussed at the same time.

    The question was then put to a vote, and the Indian delegation's proposal was passed with the usual majority. Forty-eight delegations voted in favor, five delegations (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia) voted against, and four delegations (Turkey, Ecuador, Thailand, and the Kuomintang representative) abstained.

    The Political Committee then began discussing the thirteen-nation proposal.

    British representative Younger asserted that the thirteen-nation delegation's proposal was the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    American representative Austin also supported the thirteen-nation delegation's proposal and spoke of the need to stop aggression and "localize the conflict." He also said that his delegation insisted on first stopping hostilities in Korea, and then resolving all other political issues.

    Near the end of the morning meeting on the 12th, the Syrian representative proposed that the thirteen-nation proposal be put to a vote immediately, but after strenuous opposition from Soviet representative Malik, the chairman ruled in accordance with Malik's proposal to postpone the thirteen-nation proposal for continued discussion on the morning of the 13th.

    At the morning meeting on the 13th, Soviet representative Malik spoke. He said that the Soviet delegation had carefully studied this proposal and had taken into consideration three points when it was drafted and discussed. The first point is the situation faced by the American interventionist forces in Korea due to the heroic and self-sacrificing struggle of the Korean people and their friend, the Chinese patriots. The second point is the environment in which this proposal was drafted. Under the pressure of the American bloc, under the pressure of the American delegation (this pressure being exerted directly through the Philippine representative), the proposers of this proposal had to submit two proposals, one that was more satisfactory to the United States and the other that was not or not so satisfactory to the United States. The fact that the first proposal included the Philippine representative, who serves the United States, while the second proposal did not, is proof of this. The third point is the meaningful statement made by British representative Younger on December 12th and later reiterated by American representative Austin. What are they primarily concerned about in the statement? They are not concerned about the situation of the Korean people, they are not paying attention to the threat to peace and security in the Far East, nor are they considering the various problems in the Far East caused by the American aggression against Korea, China, and the people of other countries in Asia. They are only seeking one thing, which is an immediate ceasefire in Korea, so that the American and British troops fighting there can be reorganized, so that they can recover from the blows given to them by the North Korean army and its aid, the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    Malik said: American representative Austin has requested a ceasefire first and then try to resolve other political issues. Judging from these considerations, from this attitude of the American and British delegations towards the Korean issue, is it not very obvious that the proposal on a ceasefire is hypocritical, is an intention to obtain a respite, to disguise the intention of defeated troops to reorganize and re-organize themselves to continue their armed intervention?

    Malik continued: But I do not think that the proposers – the representatives of the Arab and Asian countries – have such intentions. Their intentions are undoubtedly good, but given the circumstances in which this proposal was made, given that the proposers of this proposal had submitted two proposals and were forced to insist on giving priority to discussing the first proposal, which is of particular concern to the United States and Britain, one can only conclude that this proposal is only satisfying and only taking into account the interests of the United States and Britain, which are carrying out armed intervention in Korea.

    Malik continued: American representative Austin raised the question of "war or peace in the Far East" in his speech. But Austin only raised this question now, only mentioned this question for the first time in the Security Council a few days ago. Prior to this, he never mentioned this question. Although the Soviet delegation proposed a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in the Security Council as early as August, the American aggressors rejected this proposal. Malik emphasized: If the American delegation and the American government are truly thinking about peace in Korea and the Far East, the primary condition is to stop American aggression against Korea, stop American aggression against China, and stop American policy of aggression against the Far East. These are the necessary prerequisites for guaranteeing the peace and security of the people of the Far East. But the statement of the American representative clearly shows that the American ruling clique does not harbor this intention.

    Malik pointed out that the suggestion in the thirteen-nation proposal to establish a three-person group including the President of the General Assembly is unacceptable. Malik asked the committee to pay attention to the fact that the President of the General Assembly will be responsible for organizing this group, he recounted the painful experience of organizing such groups in the past, and pointed out that such groups are usually nothing more than subservient tools of the American delegation. Malik said that the General Assembly is already ending its work, therefore, it would be too naive for us to think that the group to be established can make a decision on the entire Korean issue overnight, and then submit its recommendations to this session of the General Assembly.

    Malik reminded the Political Committee to pay attention to the intention concealed in the proposal of excluding the People's Republic of China from participating in the resolution of the Korean issue. Malik continued: If it is thought that the problems of the Far East can be decided without the participation of the People's Republic of China, without the participation of the Central People's Government representing the interests of 475 million Chinese people, it is not only too naive, but also unreasonable and harmful. Without China's participation, without considering China's fundamental and vital interests in this region, no problem in the Far East can be resolved.

    Malik emphasized that only the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union, which stipulates that foreign troops should immediately withdraw from Korea and that the Korean people should have the opportunity to solve their own destiny, can guarantee peace and security in the Far East. The withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea is a necessary condition for stopping the war and stopping the fire. If, on the contrary, foreign troops do not withdraw from Korea, then there will be no way to stop the war or to resolve it peacefully.

    Malik declared that the Soviet delegation had opposed from the beginning the American-British group's insistence on including the so-called "Chinese troops' intervention in Korea" on the agenda of the General Assembly. The Soviet delegation will oppose the adoption of any proposal that allows foreign troops to remain in Korea and leads to further continuation of aggression. This is why the Soviet delegation opposes the thirteen-nation proposal and will vote against it.

    French representative Chauvel also spoke at the meeting on the 13th. He frankly admitted that what the United States and the countries participating in the American-British group are most concerned about is to give the American-British aggressor troops in Korea a chance to breathe, rather than to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and eliminate the threat to peace in the Far East. He said: The task assigned to the group to be established by the "thirteen" nation proposal must be strictly limited to the "military aspects" of the Korean issue.

    At the afternoon meeting on the 13th, Polish representative Wilblowski and Czechoslovak representative Hachdu spoke against the thirteen-nation proposal and supported the Soviet proposal. Representatives of Norway, Egypt, India, Brazil, Yemen, the Netherlands, Iran, the Philippines and Canada also spoke and requested the passage of the thirteen-nation proposal.

    Philippine representative Romulo attempted to slander the Soviet Union by saying that if the "peace" efforts of the American-British group failed, the Soviet Union would be responsible for all possible consequences. Canadian representative Pearson said that if Chinese "troops" resumed their military operations after the thirteen-nation proposal was passed, "we would have to make a decision on how to fight the new aggressors."

    Soviet representative Malik spoke last, refuting the remarks of the supporters of the thirteen-nation proposal.

    In answering Wilblowski's rant, Malik solemnly pointed out that the US government should bear full responsibility for the continued intervention in Korea and in the Far East. Malik also strongly countered the "great war" threat raised by Pearson in his speech.

    Malik exposed the Canadian representative's slander that the Soviet proposal foreshadowed that the Volunteer Army would remain in Korea as purely slanderous. Malik said: The Soviet representative's proposal clearly stated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. It goes without saying that the withdrawal of foreign troops would completely solve the problem of the Volunteer Army that appeared in Korea due to foreign armed intervention. After Malik's speech, the thirteen-nation proposal was put to a vote. The proposal was passed by fifty-one votes to five (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia), with the Kuomintang elements abstaining.

    The Political Committee then discussed the issue of future work. Representatives of Britain and other countries strongly urged that the thirteen-nation proposal be submitted to the General Assembly for consideration as soon as possible, and that the Political Committee would meet again when it received the recommendations of the three-person group established under the proposal on the basis of a ceasefire in Korea. The Soviet and Polish representatives resolutely opposed this unprecedented violation of procedure, and pointed out that the US slander against China should be discussed further, and then the US aggression against China case should be discussed. The Political Committee adjourned without making a decision on this issue.

    为侵朝美国军队骗取喘息机会联大政委会竟通过十三国提案     
    马立克发言揭穿美英集团的罪恶意图指出没有中国参加不能解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会于十二月十二、十三日开会，继续讨论诬告中华人民共和国干涉朝鲜的诽谤案。
    十二日会议开始时，印度代表劳氏代表若干国家的代表团提出了两个新的提案。
    第一个提案是代表十三国代表团——阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、印度、印度尼西亚、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和也门——提出的。这个提案提议说：应当指出“必须立即采取步骤，以防止朝鲜战事扩大到其他地区，终止朝鲜境内的战争；然后并应采取更进一步的行动，以便按照联合国的宗旨和原则，和平解决一切现存的问题”。该案并规定由联合国大会请求大会主席安迪让组成包括他本人在内的三人小组，以决定能够满意地在朝鲜停战的基础，并尽可能迅速地向大会提出建议案。
    另一个提案是代表上述除了菲律宾之外的十二个国家提出的，这个提案要求由联合国大会建议下述各国政府（提案此处留着空白，等决定后再填进去）的代表尽早举行会议，拟定建议案以便根据联合国的宗旨和原则和平解决远东现存的问题。
    劳氏把他与现在纽约的中国中央人民政府代表伍修权会谈的结果通知政治委员会。劳氏说，中国代表向我保证，中国中央人民政府不需要战争，并希望和平解决朝鲜战争。但是，该政府正不安地注视着美国军队的军事行动逼近中国的边境。据劳氏说，中华人民共和国的代表同时并提出了目前被美国军队所强占的台湾的问题。印度代表曾告知中国中央人民政府的代表说，印度政府认为，台湾问题应当根据确定台湾必须归还中国的开罗与波茨坦两个协定加以解决。
    劳氏提议第二个提案中应提到下列国家：苏联、美国、法国、英国、中华人民共和国、印度与埃及，各该国代表并即应开会制定关于和平解决远东现存各种分歧的建议。劳氏又提议，政治委员会应立即开始讨论上述提案。印度的提议得到南斯拉夫、澳大利亚与叙利亚的支持。
    苏联代表马立克反对改变审议这些问题的次序，因为苏联代表团并不认为十三国提案有任何优先权。马立克建议所有的提案都同时讨论。
    问题于是提付表决，印度代表团的提议以照例的多数票通过。四十八个代表团投赞成票，五个代表团（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克）投反对票，四个代表团（土耳其、厄瓜多尔、泰国和国民党代表）弃权。
    政委会随即开始讨论十三国提案。
    英国代表杨格断言：十三国代表团的提案是走向和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。
    美国代表奥斯汀也支持十三国代表团的提案，并且谈到制止侵略和“使冲突局部化”的必要性。他又说：他的代表团坚持首先在朝鲜停止敌对行动，然后解决其他的一切政治问题。
    十二日上午会议快结束时，叙利亚代表提议立即将十三国提案付表决，但经苏联代表马立克竭力反对后，主席裁决按照马立克的提议将十三国提案延至十三日上午继续讨论。
    在十三日上午会议上，苏联代表马立克发言。他说：苏联代表团曾仔细研究过这个提案，并且曾考虑到这个提案起草和讨论时的三点。第一点是，由于朝鲜人民及其友人中国爱国者所进行的英雄的和自我牺牲的斗争，在朝鲜的美国干涉军所面临的处境。第二点是，起草这个提案时的环境。在美国集团的压力下，在美国代表团的压力下，（这种压力是直接经由菲律宾代表而行使的），这个提案的提案人曾不得不提出两个提案，一个是美国所比较满意的，另一个是美国所不能或没有那样满意的。第一个提案的提案人中即包括为美国效劳的菲律宾代表，而第二个提案却没有，这就是证明。第三点是，十二月十二日首先由英国代表扬格所发表、后来又经美国代表奥斯汀所重述的意味深长的声明。声明表示他们首先担心的是什么呢？他们是不关心朝鲜人民的情况的，他们是不注意危及远东和平与安全的威胁的，他们也不顾到因为美国对朝鲜、对中国与对亚洲其他各国人民的侵略所引起的远东各种问题的。他们所寻求的只有一件事情，就是在朝鲜立即停战，以便使在那里作战的美国与英国的军队得以重新整顿，使他们得以从北朝鲜军队及其援助者中国人民志愿军所给予他们的打击中恢复过来。
    马立克说：美国代表奥斯汀曾要求先行停战然后再试图解决其他政治问题。从这些考虑看来，从美国与英国代表团对朝鲜问题的这种态度看来，关于停战的提案乃是虚伪的，乃是想获得一个喘息的时间，使败北的军队得以重加整顿、重新组织起来继续其武装干涉的伪装的意图，这还不很明显吗？
    马立克继续说：但我并不认为提案人——阿拉伯与亚洲国家的代表——有这样的意图。他们的用意无疑地是好的，但鉴于提出这个提案的环境与情况，鉴于这个提案的提案人曾提出两个提案，并被迫着坚持主张优先讨论为美英两国所特别关切的第一个提案，因而就只能得出这样一个结论，即：这项提案仅仅是满足并仅仅考虑到正在朝鲜进行武装干涉的美英两国的利益。
    马立克继称：美国代表奥斯汀在其演说中曾提出“远东的战争或和平”问题。但奥斯汀只是到现在才提出这个问题，只是在几天前才首次在安全理事会中提到这个问题。在此以前，他绝口不谈这一问题。虽然苏联代表团早在八月初即在安理会中提出和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，但是美国侵略者却拒绝了这一提案。马立克着重称：如果美国代表团和美国政府真正在为朝鲜和远东的和平设想，首要的条件就是停止美国对朝鲜的侵略，停止美国对中国的侵略，并停止美国对远东的侵略政策。这些乃是保证远东各国人民的和平和安全的必要先决条件。但是美国代表的声明清楚地表明：美国统治集团并没有怀抱这种意向。
    马立克指出：十三国提案中主张成立包括大会主席在内的三人小组的建议是不能接受的。马立克请委员会注意大会主席将负责组织这个小组的事实，他追述过去组织这种小组的惨痛经验，并指出：这种小组照例总不过是美国代表团的顺从的工具而已。马立克说：大会已经在结束其工作了，因此，如果我们以为这个拟予成立的小组能够在一夜之间对整个朝鲜问题作出决定，然后就把它的建议提交本届大会，就未免太天真了。
    马立克提醒政治委员会注意提案中所掩藏着的排斥中华人民共和国而不让它参加解决朝鲜问题的意图。马立克继称：如果以为没有中华人民共和国参加，没有代表四亿七千五百万中国人民的利益的中央人民政府参加讨论便能决定远东的问题，那不仅是太天真，而且是不合理和有害的。如果没有中国参加，如果不顾及中国在这个地区的根本的重大利益，远东的任何问题都是解决不了的。
    马立克强调称：只有通过苏联提出的规定外国军队立即撤出朝鲜并让朝鲜人民有可能自己解决他们命运问题的提案，才能保证远东的和平和安全。外国军队自朝鲜撤退乃是停止战事、停止开火的必要条件。如果相反地，外国军队不撤出朝鲜的话，那末，就既无法停战，也无法和平解决。
    马立克宣称：苏联代表团从一开始便反对美英集团硬把所谓“中国军队干涉朝鲜”的问题列入大会议程。苏联代表团将反对通过任何让外国军队留在朝鲜境内并导致侵略之进一步继续的提案。这就是苏联代表团为什么反对十三国提案并将投票反对这个提案的理由。
    在十三日会议上发言的尚有法国代表萧维尔。他坦白承认：美国和参加美英集团的国家所最关心的，是给在朝鲜的美英侵略军有一个喘息的机会，而不是关心和平解决朝鲜问题以及消除对远东和平的威胁。他说：“十三”国提案规定要建立的小组所负的任务，必须严格地限制在朝鲜问题的“军事方面”。
    在十三日下午会议上，波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基与捷克斯洛伐克代表哈奇杜发言反对十三国提案，并支持苏联提案。其他发言的挪威、埃及、印度、巴西、也门、荷兰、伊朗、菲律宾与加拿大代表都要求通过十三国提案。
    菲律宾代表罗慕洛企图诬赖苏联说：如果美英集团的“和平”努力失败了的话，苏联要对一切可能的后果负责。加拿大代表皮尔逊说：如果中国“军队”在十三国提案通过后，恢复其军事行动，“我们就不得不就如何对新的侵略者作战的问题采取决定。”
    苏联代表马立克最后发言，驳斥十三国提案支持者的言论。
    马立克在答复维慕洛的谰言时郑重指出：在朝鲜和在远东的干涉继续进行，美国政府应负全部责任。马立克也对皮尔逊在演说中所提出的“大战”的恫吓予以坚决的反击。
    马立克揭露了加拿大代表所说苏联提案预示志愿军将留在朝鲜的谰言纯属诽谤的性质。马立克说：苏联代表的提案明明白白地说到一切外国军队自朝鲜撤退。撤退外国军队就可以完全解决由于外国武装干涉而在朝鲜出现的志愿军的问题，是不言而喻的。马立克发言后，十三国提案即提付表决。该提案以五十一票对五票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克）通过，国民党分子弃权。
    政委会然后讨论今后工作问题。英国等代表力促十三国提案尽早提交大会审议，政委会在接到提案中所规定成立的三人小组关于在朝鲜停战的基础的建议时再行开会。苏联和波兰代表坚决反对这个空前地违反程序的建议，并指出应继续讨论美国对中国的诽谤，然后讨论美国对中国的侵略案。政委会对于这一问题未作出决定即行休会。
