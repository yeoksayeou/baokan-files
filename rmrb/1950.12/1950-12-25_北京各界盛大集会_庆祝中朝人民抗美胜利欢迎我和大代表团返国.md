Among those attending the meeting were: Zhu De, Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Situ Meitang, Li Lisan, Shao Lizi, Ma Xulun, Xu Deheng, Xu Baoju, Liang Xi, Peng Zemin, Cai Chang, Luo Longji, Zhang Xiruo, and representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, troops, factories, government agencies, and schools, totaling more than 5,000 people. Li Zhouyuan, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, was also invited to participate.

　　The venue was surrounded by the national flags of China, the Soviet Union, Korea, and various people's democratic countries, as well as huge banners reading "Defend World Peace," "Oppose American Aggression," and "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend Our Homes and Defend Our Country." In the center of the rostrum hung portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, Marshal Stalin, and General Kim Il-sung.

　　The conference opened with the orchestra playing "The Song of Defending Peace" and the national anthem. First, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, delivered the opening speech. Zhu De, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the Second World Peace Congress, Li Zhouyuan, Korean Ambassador to China, Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Ma Yinchu, member of the delegation's committee, Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, Huang Yanpei, Executive Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, Liu Yingyuan, a labor hero representing Beijing workers, and Cao Shuyuan, a student representative, delivered speeches one after another. They unanimously pointed out the great significance of the victory of the Chinese and Korean people against American aggression and the achievements of the Second World Peace Congress.

　　Chen Shutong said: The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people's war against American aggression and the success of the Warsaw Peace Congress are both great victories for peace-loving and democratic people against aggression and in defense of peace. The Chinese and Korean people's war against American aggression is fully in line with the purpose of the Warsaw Conference and is a concrete and active action to implement the resolutions of the Warsaw Conference. Finally, Chen Shutong paid high tribute to the Chinese People's Volunteers and wished them greater victories.

　　After Zhu De delivered his speech (full text to be published separately), Li Jishen, in his speech, cited the experience of the success of the Chinese revolution and pointed out: To achieve true peace, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the national defense forces of the people's democratic countries and the armed struggles of the colonial and dependent countries, and strengthen the world peace and democracy united front.

　　Guo Moruo then reported on the process of the Second World Peace Congress (full text of the report to be published separately).

　　Ambassador Li Zhouyuan delivered a speech amidst warm applause. He paid tribute to the Chinese delegation attending the Warsaw Conference and said: After the American imperialist aggressor troops were defeated in Korea, they manipulated the majority of the United Nations to pass a resolution on organizing a so-called "Korean Armistice Three-Person Committee," trying to gain some breathing space in Korea to prepare for another attack. However, we, the Korean people and the Chinese people, must not give the enemy a chance to breathe. Ambassador Li, on behalf of the Korean people, expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers who fought side by side with the Korean People's Army. He emphasized: "The immediate withdrawal of all foreign aggressor troops from Korea and the resolution of Korea's internal affairs by the Korean people themselves is the fundamental and only way to solve the Korean problem. American imperialism must withdraw all armed forces from Taiwan and recognize the due international status of the 475 million Chinese people. Only in this way can peace in the East be defended."

　　Li Lisan said: The Chinese People's Volunteers defeated the American imperialists in Korea. This concrete action to defend world peace proved what Chairman Mao said at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: The Chinese people have stood up. Li Lisan continued: Now the Korean people have also stood up, and all the people of Asia have stood up. Chairman Mao also said: American imperialism is a paper tiger. Now our Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have pierced it with bayonets, proving that it is indeed a paper tiger. The unity of the Chinese and Korean people has defeated the American imperialists, and the strong unity of the people of the world will surely defeat any warmongers.

　　In his speech, Ma Yinchu talked about his impressions of attending the Warsaw Conference.

　　Shen Junru pointed out in his speech: The victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army has shattered the American imperialists' aggressive plans in Asia and even the world. This has not only reversed the situation in Korea but also reversed the situation in the entire world. The people of China and Korea must thoroughly smash the American imperialists' aggressive conspiracy. We support Premier Zhou's statement on December 22. The American aggressive forces should get out of Korea and get out of Asia!

　　Huang Yanpei said: The great victory of the Chinese and Korean people has inspired many people in Southeast Asia who are struggling against the imperialists, and has enhanced their fighting will and confidence. After Huang Yanpei finished his speech, he suggested that the participants of the conference stand up and mourn for the martyrs of the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Korean victims. The whole audience stood up and observed a minute of silence.

　　In his speech, Zhang Xiruo pointed out that the victory of the Chinese and Korean people against American aggression has dealt a blow to the imperialists' conspiracy to prepare for war.

　　Liu Yingyuan, director of the Shijingshan Power Plant, said: The workers in the capital must actively produce, strengthen our national defense and economic strength, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and strive for the final victory.

　　Cao Shuyuan, a representative of Beijing students, stated in her speech that she firmly supports the statement issued by Premier Zhou on the 22nd of this month. After describing the active participation of Beijing students in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes, and defend our country, she emphasized: We are always ready to respond to all calls from the motherland and contribute our greatest strength to the great cause of defending peace and building the motherland.

　　The conference finally unanimously passed the "Message of Respect to the World Peace Council" and the "Message of Respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army." The conference concluded with shouts of "Long live the victory of the Korean People's Army!", "Long live the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers!", "Long live peace!" and other slogans.

    北京各界盛大集会
    庆祝中朝人民抗美胜利欢迎我和大代表团返国
    【新华社二十四日讯】北京各界庆祝中朝人民抗美胜利欢迎和大代表团返国大会，于二十四日上午十时在中山公园举行。出席大会的有：朱德、宋庆龄、李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、司徒美堂、李立三、邵力子、马叙伦、许德珩、许宝驹、梁希、彭泽民、蔡畅、罗隆基、张奚若，和各民主党派、人民团体、部队、工厂、机关、学校代表共五千余人。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使李周渊亦应邀参加。
    会场四周高悬着中国、苏联、朝鲜及各人民民主国家的国旗，和“保卫世界和平”、“反对美国侵略”、“抗美援朝保家卫国”等巨幅标语。主席台正中挂有毛泽东主席、斯大林大元帅及金日成将军的画像。
    大会在乐队演奏《保卫和平歌》和国歌声中开幕，首由中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会副主席陈叔通致开幕词。中国共产党中央政治局委员朱德、中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深、中国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会代表团团长郭沫若、朝鲜驻中国大使李周渊、中华全国总工会副主席李立三、代表团团委会委员马寅初、中国民主同盟副主席沈钧儒、民主建国会常务理事黄炎培、中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会北京分会主席张奚若、北京工人代表劳动英雄刘英源、学生代表曹淑媛等相继发表了演说。他们一致指出了中朝人民抗美胜利及世界第二届保卫和平大会的成就的伟大意义。
    陈叔通说：中朝人民的抗美战争的伟大胜利与华沙和平大会的成功，都是爱好和平民主的人民反对侵略保卫和平的大胜利。中朝人民进行反对美国侵略的战争，完全符合华沙大会的宗旨，而且是以具体积极的行动来实现华沙大会的决议。陈叔通最后对中国人民志愿军致崇高的敬意，并预祝他们取得更大的胜利。
    继朱德发表演说（全文另发）后，李济深在致辞中引述了中国革命成功的经验，并指出：要实现真正的和平，必须加强以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的领导，加强人民民主国家的国防力量和殖民地附属国的武装斗争，并加强世界和平民主统一战线。
    郭沫若接着报告了第二届世界保卫和平大会的经过（报告全文另发）。
    李周渊大使在热烈掌声中发表演说。他向出席华沙大会的中国代表团致敬，并说：美帝国主义侵略军在朝鲜吃了大败仗后，就操纵联合国的多数通过了关于组织所谓“朝鲜停战三人委员会”的决议，想在朝鲜骗取一些喘息的时间，准备再次进攻。可是，我们朝鲜人民和中国人民决不能给敌人以喘息的机会。李大使代表朝鲜人民向与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民志愿军表示深切的谢意。他强调说：“所有的外国侵略军队立即撤出朝鲜、朝鲜的内政由朝鲜人民自己来解决，这是解决朝鲜问题的根本、唯一的方法。美帝国主义一定要从台湾撤走一切武装力量，要承认四万七千五百万中国人民在国际上的应有的地位。只有这样才能保卫东方的和平。”
    李立三说：中国人民志愿军在朝鲜打败了美帝国主义者，这一保卫世界和平的具体行动证明了毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上说的话：中国人民站起来了。李立三继称：现在朝鲜人民也站起来了，全亚洲人民都站起来了。毛主席又说过：美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。现在我们中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军用刺刀把它戳穿了，证明它实在是一只纸老虎。中朝人民的团结已战胜了美帝国主义者，全世界人民的坚强团结，就一定能战胜任何战争贩子。
    马寅初在发言中，谈述了他出席华沙大会的印象。
    沈钧儒在讲话中指出：中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的胜利，粉碎了美帝国主义在亚洲甚至全世界的侵略计划，这不但扭转了朝鲜的局势，而且也扭转了整个世界的局势。中朝两国人民必须彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。我们拥护周总理十二月二十二日的声明，美国侵略势力应该滚出朝鲜去，滚出亚洲去！
    黄炎培说：中朝两国人民的伟大胜利，鼓舞了许多正在和帝国主义者苦斗的东南亚人民，提高了他们的战斗意志和信心。黄炎培演说完毕后，建议大会参加者起立，为朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军的烈士及朝鲜被难人民致哀。全场即起立致哀一分钟。
    张奚若在发言中指出了中朝人民的抗美胜利打击了帝国主义备战的阴谋。
    石景山发电厂厂长刘英源称：首都的工人一定要积极生产，加强我们的国防力量和经济力量，来支援中国人民志愿军，争取最后的胜利。
    北京学生代表曹淑媛在讲话中表示坚决拥护周总理在本月二十二日所发表的声明。她在叙述了北京学生积极参加抗美援朝保家卫国的运动情况后强调说：我们随时准备响应祖国的一切号召，把我们最大的力量，贡献给保卫和平与建设祖国的伟大事业。
    大会最后一致通过“致世界保卫和平委员会致敬电”及“向中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军致敬电”。大会在高呼“朝鲜人民军胜利万岁！”、“中国人民志愿军胜利万岁！”、“和平胜利万岁！”等口号声中结束。
