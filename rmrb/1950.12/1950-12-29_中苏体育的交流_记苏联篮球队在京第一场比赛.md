    Sino-Soviet Sports Exchange
    ——A Record of the First Match of the Soviet Basketball Team in Beijing
    Zhang Qihua
    The Soviet sports delegation's basketball team had its first friendly match yesterday afternoon with the capital's "Beijing United" team. A total of more than 3,000 guests from various government agencies, organizations, and diplomatic envoys to China attended the event. Before the match, Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, delivered a welcoming speech, and Romanov, the head of the Soviet sports delegation, delivered a reply.
    In this match, the people of China and the Soviet Union exchanged sports experiences. The Chinese people demonstrated their enthusiastic love for Soviet sports, and Chinese sports workers and athletes expressed their spirit of learning from the advanced experience of Soviet sports.
    The Soviet team's players who took the field were Lysov, Korneev, Butautas, Korgea, and Petkevicius. These six are the earlier basic players of the Soviet team and honored athletes who have won various championships.
    The Beijing United team's players who took the field were Wang Shengzhi, Zhou Baoen, Deng Huayao, Chen Wenbin, and Zhao Zhenmian. Among the five, Zhou and Chen had played against the Soviet team in Prague.
    The Soviet players are characterized by their height, weight, abundant strength, rapid offense, strong defense, skillful passing, and accurate shooting. In offense, they mainly adopt the "triangle fast pass," often breaking through the center, wedging into the formation, and directly "laying up." In defense, they completely use "man-to-man" marking, expanding the depth of the formation, and not allowing approach under the basket. Their superior technology at the world's highest level is deeply worth learning from.
    The Beijing United players, based on the strategy determined by their own physical conditions, used several practiced tactical methods in offense, using positional changes, inducing people to block people, creating opportunities, and shooting from afar. In defense, they tried to shorten the battle line as much as possible, consolidate the core position, and prevent strong breakthroughs with greater density. They can also improvise in the game, using ingenious short passes and shooting under the basket.
    The match was conducted in a warm and friendly atmosphere throughout. In the second half, the two sides had a relatively long period of stalemate, with you scoring and me scoring, creating a climax in the match.
    The result of the match was 56 to 43, with the Soviet team winning. Soviet team captain Lysov said: The Chinese basketball players' skills have improved compared to the level of the competition in Prague. Wang Shengzhi, the captain of the Beijing United team, also emphasized that this competition gave us the opportunity to learn from advanced Soviet sports, and it will further consolidate the friendship between the sports circles of China and the Soviet Union.

    中苏体育的交流
    ——记苏联篮球队在京第一场比赛
    张其华
    苏联体育代表团篮球队昨日下午与首都“京联”队作初次友谊比赛。各机关、团体来宾与各国驻华外交使节等共三千余人到场参观。比赛前，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会副书记廖承志致欢迎词，并由苏联体育代表团团长罗曼诺夫致答词。
    这次比赛中，中苏两国人民交流了体育经验，中国人民表现了他们对苏联体育的热烈爱好，而中国的体育工作者和运动员们则更表示出他们向苏联体育先进经验学习的精神。
    苏联队登场的队员是雷索夫、阔聂夫、布达乌塔斯、阔尔吉亚、别特加维秋斯。这六人是苏联队的参加较早的基本队员，获得各种锦标的荣誉选手。
    京联队上场的王胜治、周宝恩、邓华耀、陈文彬和赵振绵。五人中，周、陈二人是曾在布拉格和苏联队做过比赛的。
    苏联队员们的特点是身高体重，气力充沛，进攻迅速，防守强固，传递熟练，射篮准确。他们在进攻中主要采取“三角快传”，经常中心突破，楔入阵地，直接“上篮”。防御时则完全采用“人跟人”，扩大阵地的纵深，篮下不容接近。他们的世界最高水平的优越技术，是深深值得我们学习的。
    京联队员们根据自己身体条件所决定的战略，是进攻时使用几个练就的策略方法，利用位置变化，诱人挡人，造成机会，远射投篮。防御时则尽量缩短战线，巩固核心阵地，以较大的密度防止强有力的突入。他们在比赛中还能随机应变，运用精巧短传，篮下投进。
    比赛始终在热烈而友好的气氛中进行。后半时双方曾有一个较长的时间形成相持，你投我进，造成比赛过程中的高潮。
    比赛的结果是五十六比四十三，苏联队获胜。苏联队队长雷索夫说：中国篮球队员的技术比起在布拉格比赛时的水平已经有了很大的进步。京联队队长王胜治也强调指出，这次比赛使我们获得向先进的苏联体育学习的机会，它更将进一步巩固中苏两国体育界的友谊。（附图片）
