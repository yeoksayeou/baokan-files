　　Invisible Frontline
　　"Invisible Frontline" tells the story of how, after the complete liberation of Northeast China, the heinous Chiang-American reactionary secret agents still carried out rumors and sabotage in secret, and how they were finally completely uncovered by our people's police organs.
　　This film can remind us that during peaceful construction, we should be more vigilant against enemies infiltrating our interior to carry out sabotage. We must oppose Secretary Ma's bureaucratic style of complete paralysis towards the enemy in the film. We must learn from the good example of the old man in the engraving shop who helped the public security personnel discover the secret agents. We must also learn from the spirit of those public security personnel in the film who are active, responsible, and loyal to the people in fighting the enemy. Let those die-hard American-Chiang bandits and secret agents be exposed in their true colors and surrender to the people.

    无形的战线
    《无形的战线》是叙述在东北全面解放后，万恶的蒋美反动特务，仍然暗地里进行造谣破坏，以及最后被我们人民警察机关全部破获的经过情形。
    这部影片可以提醒我们，在和平建设的时候，更应警惕敌人钻入我们内部来进行破坏。我们要反对影片里马秘书那种对敌完全麻痹的官僚主义作风，我们要学习刻字铺老头协助公安人员发现特务的好榜样，还要学习片子里那些积极负责忠诚为人民服务的公安人员对敌斗争的精神。让那些美蒋死硬匪特在人民面前原形毕露低首伏罪吧。
