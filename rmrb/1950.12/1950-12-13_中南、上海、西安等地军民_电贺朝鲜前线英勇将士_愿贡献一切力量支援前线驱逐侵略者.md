Telegrams of Congratulation from Military and Civilians in Central South, Shanghai, Xi'an and Other Places to the Heroic Soldiers on the Korean Front
Willing to Contribute All Their Strength to Support the Front and Drive Out the Aggressors

Telegram from all commanders and fighters of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

    We are thrilled to hear that you have crushed the general offensive of the American invading army and liberated Pyongyang. We extend our highest respect to you. Under the unified command of the headquarters of the Korean People's Army, you have repeatedly achieved great victories in defeating the United States and other invading armies together with the Korean People's Army. This fully proves that the people's armed forces standing on the side of justice in resisting aggression are powerful and invincible; while the American invading army, though well-equipped, is demoralized and unpopular, is a paper tiger that can be completely defeated. Comrades! Thanks to your arduous, heroic, tenacious and flexible operations, you have reversed the serious military situation on the Korean battlefield, forcing the invaders to tremble in the face of the powerful people's forces, and greatly demonstrated the strength of the world's peaceful and democratic forces. Your contribution to defending the motherland, aiding friendly countries, and safeguarding world peace is very great and praised by the world. We hope that you will continue to make persistent efforts, advance bravely, and strive to completely eliminate the interventionist forces of imperialism in Korea, and fight for the assistance of the Korean people in establishing an independent, unified and democratic Korea.
