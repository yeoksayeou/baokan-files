    Learn from Labor Models, Salute Labor Models!
    Railway Employees Put Forward a Large Number of Rationalization Proposals
    [Xinhua News Agency] Over the past year, rationalization proposals and significant innovations from railway employees have resolved many difficulties for various departments of railway enterprises, becoming an important force in promoting the advancement of the entire railway construction. Rationalization proposals this year are characterized by greater mass participation and universality. According to incomplete statistics: The Jilin Railway Bureau of the Northeast Railway Administration approved a total of 1,155 rationalization proposals this year, and the Tianjin Bureau adopted 498 rationalization proposals from March to the end of November, saving the country the equivalent of more than 4 million catties of millet. The Shanghai railway system has also had more than 1,000 rationalization proposals in the past year or so, with nearly 600 being adopted. As a result of the development of rationalization proposals this year at the Zhangjiakou Railway Factory, the working hours saved alone amounted to 8,464.
    The content of the rationalization proposals is diverse. Some have improved tools, and some have improved work systems or methods. The effects produced have either solved a certain current difficulty, improved work efficiency, or saved a large amount of manpower and materials.
    Tian Zhonglin, a track maintenance worker at the Yingcheng track maintenance section of the Jilin Railway Administration, created a segmented responsible reverse screening ballast method, which is a major reform in track maintenance work. In the past, clearing the ballast was done with a large peeling method, which wasted working hours and affected driving safety. With the new method, not only is the number of turning times reduced, but also there is ballast in the sleeper intervals, which can ensure driving safety. At the same time, due to the simplicity of the division of labor, work efficiency has increased by more than 50%. In the work of correcting rail creeping in track maintenance, there have been two important innovations in improving tools in the past year. Jiang Zhenyuan of the Cangzhou Works Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau invented a rail creeping corrector, which reduced the number of people required to correct rail creeping from fifteen to three, and can avoid damage to equipment such as screws, fishplates, and sleepers. Xu Zeyu of the Zhenjiang Works Section of the Shanghai Railway Bureau and Wang Jimin of the Nanjing Works Section also created bolt anti-creepers suitable for various rail types, which solved the difficulty of anti-creeping in works. Many improvements in rationalization proposals have greatly reduced the physical exertion of manual labor and improved efficiency. Li Gaotian of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot in Northeast China created a cutting machine in the patriotic production competition, which is eighty times more efficient than manual chopping. Gu Shaoxun, a foreman at the wheel branch of the Harbin Railway Factory, created a rust removal tooth knife, which can scrape a shaft rust in only five minutes, which is ten times more efficient than the past when workers took the wrong force to scrape the shaft rust. Sun Lianwang of Tangshan Railway Factory transformed the diesel copper melting furnace, which not only improved the quality but also reduced the cost, saving about 224 million yuan a year.
    Shanxi Province Holds Conference of Labor Models for Industry and Agriculture
    [Xinhua News Agency] Shanxi Province held its first provincial conference of labor models for industry and agriculture from November 20th to the 2nd of this month. 533 labor models from factories, mines, rural areas, and troops attended the meeting. At the meeting, labor models from various places summarized the achievements in industrial and agricultural production over the past year and widely exchanged production experience, which made the labor models attending the meeting more clearly aware of the direction of future production development.
    When summarizing the achievements in industrial production this year, the meeting pointed out that due to the leadership of labor models and the active efforts of the masses of workers, industrial production in the province has exceeded the level of the Japanese invaders and the rule of the Yan (Xishan) bandits. This autumn, 17 state-owned and provincial-owned factories and mines in the province carried out autumn production competitions and launched movements to improve technology and rationalization proposals. The masses of workers demonstrated a high degree of production enthusiasm, and the creations, improvements, and various new production records of the factory and mine employees totaled more than 400 items. As a result, many public factories and mines completed their annual production tasks one month ahead of schedule, giving the industrial construction of the province a new look.
    The meeting believes that agricultural production has also achieved great results in the past year. This year, the province's grain production increased by 870 million catties compared with last year, and cotton production increased by 16 million catties compared with last year. The old agricultural production areas have returned to the pre-war level, and the new areas have also reached 85% of the pre-war level. The achievement of these achievements is inseparable from the fact that labor models in various places took the lead in leading farmers to engage in improved agricultural technology and consolidate and develop labor mutual aid organizations.
    At the end of the meeting, the labor models attending the meeting unanimously stated that in future industrial and agricultural production, they will further play a leading role, lead workers and farmers throughout the province to carry out large-scale patriotic production competition movements, and strive to build a new Shanxi and consolidate national defense.
    At the end of the meeting, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government issued awards to reward labor models with excellent production achievements. The meeting also passed "A Telegram to Chairman Mao" and "Vigorously Carry Out the Movement to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea" and other circular telegrams.
    Hebei Province Holds Agricultural Labor Model Conference
    [Xinhua News Agency] The People's Government of Hebei Province, where grain and cotton production has exceeded the pre-war level, convened the first provincial agricultural labor model conference from November 25th to December 3rd. The 519 labor models who participated in the conference exchanged and summarized some of the basic experiences in agricultural production in the province over the past year.
    This year, Hebei Province achieved an average of 80% of a good harvest, producing 14.7 billion catties of grain, which is 102% of the pre-war output: 3.58 million dan of ginned cotton was produced, which is 181% of the average output in the seven years before the war (1931-1937).
    In this year's agricultural production campaign, a mass "comparison of production and evaluation of model workers" campaign was widely carried out throughout the province, and tens of thousands of labor models and technical experts emerged, and tens of thousands of technical research groups were organized, becoming the core force for promoting agricultural production throughout the province.
    At the conference, the labor models further clarified their understanding of "organizing" as the only way to go from poverty to prosperity by summarizing successful production experiences and methods. Therefore, the meeting focused on studying the issue of organizing and drew some basic experiences: In the newly liberated areas, after the land reform, when initially organizing labor mutual aid, it is necessary to strengthen the publicity and education of the peasant masses, and it is best to make a sample for the peasants to see, resolutely implement the policy of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange, so that the peasants are aware of the benefits of organizing. In the mutual aid groups in the old liberated areas, in addition to correctly implementing the principles of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange and strengthening the leadership of the mutual aid groups, the main task is to propose or add new content on the basis of the existing conditions according to the specific conditions of the local area, and closely integrate them with the improvement of agricultural technology, appropriately develop sideline businesses within the mutual aid groups, and focus on solving the problem of the way out for the surplus labor force. In addition, the assistance of supply and marketing cooperatives to mutual aid groups is also a necessary condition for improving mutual aid organizations.
    Through this meeting, the labor models increased a lot of knowledge and learned a lot of production experience and methods. They all said that in the future, they will further lead the peasant masses to continue to consolidate and develop mutual aid organizations, improve agricultural technology, and carry out the agricultural production movement better, so as to enhance the strength of the country.

    向劳动模范看齐，向劳动模范致敬！
    铁路员工提出大量合理化建议
    【新华社讯】铁路员工的合理化建议和重要创造，一年来为铁道企业各部门解决了不少困难，成为推动整个铁道建设前进的重要力量。合理化建议今年更具有群众性和普遍性的特点。据不完全的材料：东北铁路吉林管理局今年共批准采用的合理化建议就有一千一百五十五件，天津局从今年三月到十一月底采用的合理化建议有四百九十八件，为国家节约的价值达四百余万斤小米。上海铁路系统的合理化建议一年多来也有一千多件，被采用的近六百件。张家口铁路工厂今年开展合理化建议的结果，仅工时一项即节省了八千四百六十四个。
    合理化建议的内容是多种多样的。有的改进了工具，有的改进了工作制度或工作方法；所产生的效果有的是解决了当前某一困难，有的是提高了工作效率，或者节约大量人力物力。
    吉林铁路管理局营城养路工区养路工田忠林创造的分段负责倒筛石碴法，是养路工作中的一大改革。过去清筛石碴，用大扒皮办法，既浪费工时，且影响行车安全，采用新法后，不但减少了翻动次数，且枕木间隔内都有石碴，可以保证行车安全。同时由于分工简易，工作效率提高了百分之五十以上。在养路方面矫正钢轨爬行的工作中，一年来属于改进工具方面的重要创造即有两种。天津铁路局沧州工务段姜振元发明钢轨爬行矫正器，使矫正钢轨爬行的工作由需十五人减至三人，并可避免螺丝、鱼尾夹板、枕木等器材的损坏。上海铁路局镇江工务段徐则玉和南京工务段王继岷也创造了适用于各种轨型的螺栓防爬器，解决了工务上防爬的困难。合理化建议中的许多改进，大大减轻了人工的体力消耗，且提高了效率。东北苏家屯机务段李高田在爱国主义生产竞赛中创造的切断机，比较人工剁制的效率提高了八十倍。哈尔滨铁路工厂车轮分厂领工员顾绍勋创造了除锈牙刀，只需五分钟即能刮一根轴锈，与过去工人拿错力刮轴锈比较提高效率十倍。唐山铁路工厂孙连旺改造了柴油化铜炉，不但提高了品质，并且减低了成本，一年约可节省二亿二千四百余万元。
    山西省召开工农业劳动模范会议
    【新华社讯】山西省于十一月二十日到本月二日举行全省第一次工农业劳动模范大会。出席会议的有工厂、矿山、农村、部队等工农业劳动模范五百三十三名。会上，各地劳动模范总结了一年来的工农业生产成绩，广泛地交流了生产经验，使与会的劳动模范更加明确地认识到今后发展生产的方向。
    会议在总结今年工业生产成绩时指出，一年来由于依靠劳动模范的带头和工人群众的积极努力，全省工业生产已超过了日寇和阎（锡山）匪统治时期的水平。今年秋季，全省十七个国营和省营的厂矿开展了秋季生产竞赛，进行了改进技术和合理化建议运动，工人群众发挥了高度的生产积极性，各厂矿职工的创造、改进和各种生产新纪录计达四百余件，因而，使许多公营厂矿都提前一月完成全年的生产任务，使全省工业建设呈现了新的面貌。
    会议认为：一年来的农业生产也同样获得很大成绩。今年全省粮食生产比去年增产八亿七千万斤，棉花比去年增产一千六百万斤。农业生产老区已恢复到战前水平，新区也达到战前水平的百分之八十五。这些成绩的获得，是与各地劳动模范带头领导农民从事改良农业技术，巩固和发展劳动互助组织是分不开的。
    会议结束时，与会劳动模范一致表示：在今后的工业和农业生产中，将进一步地起带头作用，带动全省工人和农民开展大规模的爱国主义的生产竞赛运动，为建设新山西和巩固国防而努力。
    会议最后由山西省人民政府颁发奖品，奖励生产成绩优良的劳动模范。会议并通过“向毛主席致敬电”和“大力开展抗美援朝运动”等通电。
    河北省举行农业劳动模范大会
    【新华社讯】粮棉生产超过了战前水平的河北省，人民政府在十一月二十五日到十二月三日召开了全省第一届农业劳动模范大会。参加大会的五百一十九名劳动模范们，在会上交流和总结了一年来全省农业生产中的一些基本经验。
    今年河北全省平均获得八成年景，共产粮食一百四十七亿斤，为战前产量的百分之一百零二：产皮棉三百五十八万担，为战前七年（一九三一——三七）平均产量的百分之一百八十一。
    在今年的农业生产运动中，全省各地普遍开展了群众性的“比生产评模范”运动，涌现出十几万劳动模范和技术能手，组织起几万个技术研究小组，成为推动全省农业生产的核心力量。
    大会上，劳动模范们从总结成功的生产经验和方法中，进一步明确地认识到“组织起来”是从穷苦走向富裕的必由之路。因此会上着重地研究了组织起来的问题，并得出一些基本经验：在新解放区，经过了土地改革之后，初步组织劳动互助时，必须加强对农民群众的宣传教育，最好能先作出样子来给农民们看，坚决贯彻自愿两利、等价交换的政策，使农民们觉悟到组织起来的好处。在老解放区的互助组，除正确执行自愿两利等价交换的原则和加强互助组的领导外，主要是要根据当地具体条件，在现有的基础上提出或增加新的内容，并与提高农业技术密切结合，在互助组内适当地开展副业，着重解决剩余劳动力的出路问题。此外，供销合作社对互助组的扶助，也是提高互助组织的必要条件。
    通过了这次会议，劳动模范们增进了很多知识，学得了不少生产经验和办法。他们都表示：今后要更进一步地带领农民群众，继续巩固和发展互助组织，提高农业技术，把农业生产运动开展得更好，以增强国家的力量。
