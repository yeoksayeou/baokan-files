    I watched the second episode of "The Fall of Berlin" twice within three days with uncontrollable joy. The moving power of this film lies not only in the greatness of its war scenes, allowing us to see the actual situation of the invincible Soviet army capturing Berlin as if we were on the scene, but also in its profound ideological and political educational role.
    The fact that this film is being released at a time when peace-loving and democratic people all over the world are focusing their attention on the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army jointly resisting the American aggressors particularly enhances its political significance.
    The second episode of "The Fall of Berlin" is particularly enlightening to us in at least the following two aspects.
    First, this film clearly shows that the socialist society and state system are superior, more vital, and more solid than the capitalist society and state system. This is what Stalin told us at the beginning of the film, and it is also proven by the historical facts of "The Fall of Berlin." When the Hitler bandits launched a treacherous blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union, many well-intentioned people lacking experience in revolutionary war and malicious people believed that the Soviet Union was bound to fail. They did not understand the great power of the socialist system. The Soviet socialist system, based on the common ownership of the means of production, with the principle of "he who does not work, neither shall he eat," eliminated all forms of exploitation of man by man. It was built by the conscious and creative labor of the Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet state (the dictatorship of the proletariat). Socialism united the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, guaranteed the growth of Soviet national strength, and continuously improved the material and cultural life of the people. There was no class opposition and conflict between the exploited and the exploiting classes in the Soviet Union, so it was truly united and the whole people were politically and spiritually unified. It was precisely this situation that enabled the Soviet Union to shift its national economy from peacetime production to wartime production in the first few months of the war (while it took the United States almost two years to do this), and to use the winter months (November, December 1941, and January 1942) to evacuate the main equipment, raw materials, and materials of factories in industrial centers near the front lines in Ukraine and Belarus to the remote rear areas of the Urals and Siberia, and to quickly restore production there; and in the second half of 1942, many new large industrial centers were built in the Urals, Siberia, and Central Asia. This could only be done by a socialist country: under such severe war conditions, production not only did not decline, but also, due to the evacuation of machines and the new industrial construction during the war, enabled the Soviet Union to produce more than 30,000 tanks, self-propelled guns, and armored vehicles, about 40,000 aircraft, about 120,000 artillery pieces, about 450,000 portable machine guns and heavy machine guns, and more than 3 million rifles every year in the last three years of the war... The advantages of the socialist system guaranteed that the Soviet Union not only had sufficient military power to deal with the invaders, but also guaranteed the country's endless human reserves. We know that although the German invaders occupied almost the whole of Europe, its war economy was constantly declining, and its manpower was becoming increasingly insufficient, so that it needed to use the most shameless and brutal means to plunder labor from the occupied countries.
    "The socialist system is the best system" (as Stalin said in the film): this is the source of Soviet power. Therefore, the Soviet Union could not only drive the German invaders out of the Soviet Union with its own strength, but also launch the great campaign to attack Berlin on April 16, 1945 with its own strength, "without American aid," and finally eliminate the Hitler gang.
    Second, the second episode of "The Fall of Berlin" once again explained Stalin's famous saying to us with profound artistic techniques: "Victory will not come by itself." The superiority of the socialist system is manifested through the Soviet people's hard struggle to create and build, and the unanimous and resolute struggle against the enemy. The capture of Berlin was bought with the blood and lives of many Soviet soldiers. When the banner of Soviet victory was planted on the top of the Reichstag in Berlin, many Soviet soldiers gave their heroic lives. The bloodstains on Alyosha's forehead and the blood-stained scarf of his close comrade-in-arms, Guo Shijia, illustrate this point to us. The immortal heroes, the Guo Shijias, eliminated the Hitler gang with their own lives, saving Germany, saving Europe, and saving the world. Their blood was not shed in vain. They tell us that whether it is the Hitler invaders or any other invaders, they can be defeated, and the people, the peace-loving and democratic people, the people who strive for the victory of socialism throughout the world, can never be defeated.
    Our Chinese people are now facing a glorious and great historical task: to defeat the last grandson of Hitler in the East—the aggressive forces of American imperialism. Our people are enthusiastically joining the just struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country through voluntary actions. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea has also achieved initial victories, and the American aggressors have been resolutely and heavily hit. At this time, the release of "The Fall of Berlin" will undoubtedly increase our people's confidence in the struggle. Although we are not yet a socialist country, we are a Chinese people's democratic society and state system under the leadership of Chairman Mao that belongs to the socialist system, and it has already proved in the long liberation war that it has more superior characteristics than the capitalist system and the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary system. The great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance closely unites the people of China and the Soviet Union, and we have all the conditions to destroy the enemy that invades our motherland—American imperialism. The joint struggle of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of all countries in the world peace camp led by the Soviet Union will undoubtedly completely shatter the American aggressors' war plan—just as the Soviet army's "Fall of Berlin" eliminated the Hitler gang. Therefore, "The Fall of Berlin" is a demonstration of the brilliance and superiority of the socialist system, a warning to the American aggressors, and an encouragement to the anti-American struggle of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world.

    《攻克柏林》下集观后
    蒋齐生
    我以难以遏制的喜悦，三天之内看了两次《攻克柏林》下集。这个影片感人的力量，不仅在于它战争场面的伟大，使我们如身临其境地看到无敌苏军攻克柏林的实况；而且在于它的深刻的思想性和政治教育作用。
    这个影片，恰好在全世界爱好和平民主的人民集中注意于朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队共同抗击美国侵略者的时候放映，就特别增加了它的政治意义。
    《攻克柏林》下集至少在下述两点上对我们有特别的启发。
    第一，这个影片很鲜明地显示，社会主义社会与国家制度，是比资本主义社会与国家制度更优越、更有生命力、更为牢固的制度。这是影片开始时，斯大林向我们讲的，也是《攻克柏林》的史实所证明的。当希特勒匪徒们向苏联作背信弃义的闪电进攻时，许多好心而缺乏革命战争经验的人和心怀恶意的人都认为，苏联是一定要失败的。他们不了解社会主义制度的伟大力量。苏联的社会主义制度，以生产工具与生产资料的共同占有为基础，“不劳动者不得食”，它消灭了一切形式的人剥削人的制度，它是在共产党和苏维埃国家（工人阶级专政）的领导下，由苏联的工人、农民与知识分子自觉的创造性的劳动建设起来的。社会主义团结了苏联的各族人民，保证了苏联国力的增长及人民的物质与文化生活的不断提高。苏联没有剥削与被剥削的阶级的对立与冲突，因此它是真正万众一心的，全国人民在政治与精神上一致的。正是这种情况，使得苏联可以在战争的头几个月内，把全国的经济由平时生产转入战时生产（而美国在这件事情上则曾需要差不多两年），并用冬季的几个月份（一九四一年十一月、十二月和一九四二年的一月），把乌克兰和白俄罗斯接近前线地区的各工业中心的工厂主要装备、原料与资材撤退到远后方乌拉尔、西伯利亚，并在那里迅速地恢复生产；而在一九四二年下半年，又开始在乌拉尔、西伯利亚及中亚细亚建设了许多新的巨大工业中心。这是只有社会主义国家才可能作到的：在那样严重的战争条件之下，生产不仅不跌落，反而由于机器的撤退和战时新的工业建设，使苏联在战争的最后三年中，每年可生产三万辆以上的坦克、自动炮及装甲车，约四万架飞机，约十二万尊大炮，约四十五万架手提机枪及重机枪，三百万支以上的步枪……社会主义制度的优点保证苏联不仅有充足的军火对付侵略者，而且保证了国家无穷无尽的人力后备。我们知道，德国侵略者虽然占领了几乎整个欧洲，但是它的作战经济力量却是不断下降的，人力也日感不足，以致需要用最无耻的残暴手段向被占领国掠夺劳动力。
    “社会主义制度，是最好不过的制度”（斯大林在影片中所讲的）：这就是苏联力量的泉源。因此，苏联可以不仅以自己的力量从苏联国境内赶走了德国侵略者，而且可以以自己的力量，“不需要美国援助”，于一九四五年四月十六日发动进攻柏林的伟大战役，最后消灭了希特勒匪帮。
    第二，《攻克柏林》下集以深刻的艺术手法再次向我们解释了斯大林的名言：“胜利是不会自己到来的”。社会主义制度的优越性，是通过苏联人民的坚苦奋斗创造建设和全民一致坚决对敌斗争而表现出来的。柏林的攻克是许多苏军战士以自己的鲜血和生命换来的。苏军的胜利的旗帜插向柏林国会大厦的顶端时，不少苏军战士付出了自己的英雄生命。阿略莎额头的血迹及他的亲密战友郭士甲血染的巾帕，就是向我们说明这一点。永垂不朽的英雄郭士甲们，以自己的生命消灭了希特勒匪帮，拯救了德国，拯救了欧洲，拯救了世界。他们的血是没有白流的。他们告诉我们，不论是希特勒侵略者，或是任何其他侵略者，都是可以被战胜的，而人民，爱好和平、民主的人民，争取社会主义在全世界胜利的人民，是永远不可被战胜的。
    我们中国人民现在正面临着一项光荣而伟大的历史任务：在东方击败希特勒的末代王孙——美国帝国主义的侵略势力。我国人民正纷纷以志愿行动投入抗美援朝保家卫国的正义斗争，在朝作战的中国人民志愿部队，并且已取得了初步的胜利，美国侵略者已受到了坚决而沉重的打击。在这个时候，放映《攻克柏林》，毫无疑义会增加我们人民斗争的信心。我们现在虽然还不是社会主义国家，但是我们是毛主席所领导的属于社会主义体系中国人民民主的社会与国家制度，已经在长期的解放战争中证明了它有着比资本主义制度及国民党反革命制度更优越的特点。伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约又紧密地团结着中苏两国人民，我们有一切条件来摧毁侵犯自己祖国的敌人——美国帝国主义。中朝人民与以苏联为首的世界和平阵营各国人民的联合斗争，无疑将彻底粉碎美国侵略者的战争计划——正像苏军《攻克柏林》消灭了希特勒匪帮一样。所以，“攻克柏林”，这是社会主义制度的光辉与优越性的示威，这是对美国侵略者的警告，也是对中朝两国及世界人民抗美斗争的鼓舞。
