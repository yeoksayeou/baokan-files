    North China Air Force Headquarters
    Prepares to Welcome New Cadets from North China Region

    [By Our Newspaper] The North China Air Force Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army is actively preparing to welcome young students from the North China region who have gloriously joined the People's Air Force in response to the call of the motherland.

    The health and logistics departments of the headquarters have sent special personnel to various registration locations to conduct physical examinations and provide care and reception. The Political Department is formulating an educational plan for the new cadets and preparing to strengthen their cultural and recreational life.

    Comrades working at the registration points have set up four clubs, arranging exhibitions of the history of the People's Air Force, photos of learning and life at aviation schools, and various airplane charts and model exhibitions. In addition, they have prepared four to five hundred books related to the People's Liberation Army, as well as ping-pong, military chess, checkers, etc., for new cadets to browse and enjoy.

    The entire members of the art troupe responsible for taking care of the registration area have formed four groups, assigned to live with the new cadets, taking care of them in all aspects, and introducing them to the life and learning situation of the air force, so that they do not feel unfamiliar.

    The Air Force Headquarters and a certain flying squadron are preparing with boundless enthusiasm to welcome their new partners. In a letter to the new cadets, they said: "We guarantee to contribute all our strength and all the techniques we have mastered to you in the shortest possible time, and work hand in hand to build a strong People's Air Force!"
