Xinhua News Agency, 30th. U.S. imperialism is intensifying its aggression against Taiwan Province, our territory. The joint U.S.-Chiang operations staff has been established. According to a report from Tokyo American sources cited by the Telecommunications Agency on November 8th, this is the first practical result of the meeting between Truman and MacArthur on Wake Island on October 15th. With the establishment of the U.S.-Chiang joint operations staff, the United States has effectively placed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops under its direct control. According to a report in the evening edition of the Italian newspaper *La Nazione* on the 19th, the aforementioned U.S.-Chiang joint staff has submitted a detailed report to MacArthur Headquarters in Tokyo regarding the ability of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops to launch a so-called "military offensive," which insists on the necessity of intensifying the equipment and training of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops.

Two important U.S. aggressors also visited Taiwan in mid-month. One was U.S. Marshall Plan executor and head of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Foster, who flew to Taipei on the 15th. During his three days in Taiwan, he further expanded U.S. economic aggression. According to a broadcast by Taiwan Radio on the 24th, Foster "expressed interest in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's 'copper production increase plan'." The broadcast also stated: "Once this plan is implemented, the United States will have the priority to purchase surplus copper from Taiwan Province." The other was the notorious Senator Knowland, who flew to Taipei on the 17th and stayed in Taiwan for a week, holding several meetings with Chiang Kai-shek and key members of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. He also inspected the bandit gang's army, navy, air force bases, training camps, and the Kinmen Island front line. Before leaving Taiwan, Knowland delivered a speech, rehashing the old tune of MacArthur and other aggressors regarding the invasion of Taiwan. He said extremely absurdly that the Chinese people liberating their own territory of Taiwan Province would cause "immense damage to the entire Pacific region, and the security of the United States and Europe would also be lost." Knowland also advocated for aiding the mainland bandits being annihilated by the Chinese people, saying: "Adopting a defensive approach to deal with the Communists will never succeed."

    美帝加紧侵略我台湾
    美蒋“联合作战参谋部”已经成立
    蒋匪军已被置于美帝直接控制之下
    【新华社三十日讯】美帝国主义加紧侵略我国领土台湾省，美国与国民党匪帮的联合作战参谋部已经成立，据电通社十一月八日电引东京美国人士传出的消息说，这是杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟十月十五日威克岛会谈的第一个实际结果。由于美蒋联合作战参谋部的成立，美国实际上已将国民党匪帮军队置于其直接的控制之下。又据意大利《国家报》晚刊十九日所载消息称，上述美蒋联合参谋部已向东京麦克阿瑟总部提出了一项使国民党匪军能够发动所谓“军事攻势”的详尽报告书，其中坚持加紧装备和训练国民党匪军的必要。
    美国两个重要的侵略分子也曾于本月中旬先后至台湾活动。其一为美国马歇尔计划执行人、美国经济合作总署署长浮斯特，他于十五日飞抵台北。在台湾的三天中，他进一步扩张美国的经济侵略。据台湾电台二十四日广播称，浮斯特对国民党匪帮“增加铜产计划曾表兴趣”。广播又称：“此项计划一旦实行，美对台省消费多余的铜有承购的优先权。”另一为臭名远扬的参议员诺兰，他在十七日飞抵台北，曾在台湾逗留了一个星期，与蒋贼介石及国民党匪帮要员数度会商，并视察了匪帮陆、海、空军基地、训练营和金门岛前线。诺兰在离开台湾前发表了一篇谈话，重弹了麦克阿瑟等侵略分子侵略台湾的老调，他极端荒谬地说，中国人民解放自己的国土台湾省会使“整个太平洋区域蒙受莫大损害，美国与欧洲之安全亦将失去保障”。诺兰还主张援助正在被中国人民歼灭的大陆土匪武装，他说：“对付共产党采用防御方式将永无成就”。
