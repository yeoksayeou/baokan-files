Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 6th (TASS): Today, the "People's Daily" published a special article by Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg, describing his views on the achievements of the Second World Peace Congress. Ehrenburg said: Compared with the United Nations, which is holding a meeting near New York, and which is imagined to be glorious but is quite miserable in its daily life, the Warsaw Congress is a more representative people's organization. It is enough to remember one thing, namely, that the true representatives of one of the largest countries in the world—China—attended the Warsaw Congress. Their participation in the work of the committees, their speeches and suggestions, have made the resolutions passed by the World Peace Congress even more powerful.

The Paris Congress was called the Congress of Peace Defenders. A new and powerful organization was founded at that conference. At that conference, good people gathered together for the first time and condemned the conspiracies of those who were dreaming of a new war. The Warsaw Congress was named more succinctly—the Peace Congress. At this conference, there were fewer heated speeches and more concrete proposals. When establishing this international organization, people of all countries saw that the diplomats had reached a dead end, unscrupulous war propaganda was being carried out, and the lives of all nations and every individual were in danger. People of all countries also saw that the United Nations, born of the bravery of Soviet soldiers, the fortitude of guerrillas in European countries, and the efforts of ordinary people in Britain and the United States, was being turned into an advisory body for Mr. Truman and sometimes for General MacArthur. The people of all countries decided to take the cause of defending peace into their own hands. The Warsaw Congress established the World Peace Council. The congress drafted a program of peace proposals, and adopting these proposals would guarantee the safety of all countries, large and small.

Ehrenburg recounted the various proposals made by the Soviet delegation at the Second World Peace Congress, and he pointed out that all the representatives correctly supported these proposals, considering them to be a major contribution to the cause of establishing peace.

Ehrenburg continued: A reporter from the *Times* sent a report from Warsaw with regret, saying: More and more speakers unexpectedly began to repeatedly state that the socialist system and the capitalist system can coexist peacefully. Why "unexpectedly"? Thirty years ago, when Churchill organized his first anti-communist crusade, the Soviet people said this. The *Times* reporter was very indignant when he heard about peaceful coexistence. He said: "The Russians need this." Then, I would like to ask this employee of the *Times*: What do the British people need? Do they need unpeaceful coexistence, that is, a new war? No, the British people need peace, and it is precisely for this reason that the Labor Party members in power are afraid to let the peace representatives of various countries go to Sheffield. They are afraid of peaceful coexistence.

Ehrenburg said: "We left Warsaw with pleasure. Much has been achieved to ensure peace. But much work remains to be done. It is necessary to make all the people everywhere understand the various resolutions of the Peace Congress. It is necessary to force governments to pay attention to the will of the people of all countries and begin to negotiate peace. I am convinced that war can still be avoided. Finally, I want to recall that on a rainy night, an American representative looked at the new buildings of Warsaw, which had been revived from terrible ruins, and he shook my hand tightly and said: 'If we cannot prevent war, we will truly be sorry for these days in Warsaw.'"

Ehrenburg wrote in his conclusion: "The World Peace Congress has brought about many changes in the world situation, but neither Truman nor his generals, who are notorious for their 'victories' over women and children in Korea, understand this. Sooner or later, these generals will be punished for the crimes they have committed in front of the representatives of the people of all countries, especially the representatives of the American people. As for Truman, he made another most reckless speech after the World Peace Congress. He clearly did not estimate that a new force has been born, a new force sufficient to stop his conspiracies. Truman can certainly still clamor for war, but he had better not develop from rash remarks to taking action. It was not in vain that the representatives of eighty countries met and discussed, and they have reached an agreement."

    爱伦堡论二届和大
    各国人民决意自己保卫和平已使世界大势发生许多变化
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日电：今天《真理报》登载苏联作家爱伦堡的专文，叙述他对第二届世界保卫和平大会的成就。爱伦堡说：跟那正在纽约附近开会的、被人设想得很光辉然而在它的日常生活中却十分可悲的联合国组织比较起来，华沙大会乃是一个具有更大的代表性的人民团体。只要想起一件事就够明白了，即：世界上一个最大的国家——中国——的真正的代表们是出席华沙大会的。他们参与各委员会的工作，他们的演说和建议，使世界和大所通过的决议更有力量了。
    巴黎大会被称为和平保卫者的大会。一个新的强大组织就在那次大会上奠下了基础。在那次大会上，第一次聚首一堂的善良的人们，谴责了做着新战争之梦的那些人的阴谋计划。华沙大会被人命名得更为简洁——和平大会。在这次大会上，激烈的发言比较少，而具体的建议比较多了。各国人民在创立这个国际组织时，看到了外交家们已到了穷途末路，肆无忌惮的战争宣传正在进行，所有各民族的和每一个人的生命都处于危险之中。各国人民也看到了由于苏军士兵的英勇，由于欧洲各国游击战士们的刚毅，以及由于英美两国普通人民的努力而诞生的联合国，正被人变成了杜鲁门先生的、有时也变成了麦克阿瑟将军的咨询机关了。各国人民决意把保卫和平的事业掌握在他们自己的手里。华沙大会成立了世界保卫和平委员会。大会起草了关于和平提案的纲领，采纳这些提案就能够保障一切大小国家的安全。
    爱伦堡讲述了苏联代表团在第二届世界保卫和平大会上所提出的各项建议，他指出：所有的代表都正确地拥护这些建议，认为它们是对确立和平的事业的一个重大贡献。
    爱伦堡继称：《泰晤士报》的记者带着遗憾的心情从华沙发出报道说：有越来越多的发表演说的人出人意料地开始反复说明社会主义制度和资本主义制度能够和平共存。为什么“出人意料”呀？在三十年前，当邱吉尔组织他的第一次反共十字军的时候，苏维埃人民就说过这句话了。《泰晤士报》的记者听到关于和平共存的话很愤慨，他说：“俄国人需要这样。”那么，我要问问《泰晤士报》的这个雇员：英国老百姓需要的是什么呢？难道他们需要不和平的共存吗，那就是说，需要新战争吗？不，英国老百姓需要和平，而正因为这个缘故，当权的工党人士害怕让各国的和平代表们到设菲尔德去。他们害怕和平共存。
    爱伦堡说：“我们怀着愉快的心情离别了华沙。为了保障和平，已有许多成就。但是许多工作还在前面。必须使无论一切地方的一切人民都了解和平大会的各项决议。必须迫使各国政府注意到各国人民的意志，而开始商谈和平。我确信战争还是能够避免的。最后，我要回忆在一个阴雨的夜晚，一位美国代表眺望着在可怕的废墟中复兴起来的华沙的新建筑物，他紧紧地握住我的手说：“如果我们不能防止战争，我们真对不起在华沙的这些日子。”
    爱伦堡在结语中写道：“世界保卫和平大会已使世界大势发生了许多变化，但是，不论是杜鲁门、不论是他的那些因为对朝鲜的妇女和儿童取得‘胜利’而恶名昭彰的将军们，都是不明了这一点的。这些将军们由于他们所犯的这些罪行，迟早总要在各国人民的代表，首先在美国人民的代表的面前受到惩赝的。至于杜鲁门，他竟在世界和平大会之后，又发表了一次最轻率的演说。他分明不曾估计到已经诞生了新的力量，足以阻止他的阴谋的新力量。杜鲁门固然还能够叫嚣战争，但是他最好还是不要从暴躁的言论发展到采取行动罢。八十个国家的代表们开会讨论并不是徒然的，他们已取得协议了。”
