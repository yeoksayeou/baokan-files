Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 7th:

    The Literary Gazette published a special article on the 5th entitled "Washington's Hysteria," pointing out that the Atlantic Pact nations are already splitting before they have been consolidated. The article said that these countries have differences of opinion on the Far East issue. On the issue of rearmament, Britain is wavering and attempting to break free from American control. The French oppose the re-militarization of West Germany. Regarding the Soviet Union's proposals on the German question, no genuine agreement has been reached between the United States, Britain, and France. The critical aspects of their cooperation were sharply revealed when Truman made a threatening statement at a press conference on November 30th, declaring an intention to expand aggression.

    The article further said: American warmongers hope to quickly achieve victory in the Korean War in order to consolidate the unity of the North Atlantic Treaty nations, but this subjective wishful thinking has been shattered. The United States has made a lamentable miscalculation in diplomacy. The war provoked by the United States in Korea has only promoted further disintegration of the Atlantic Pact nations, which will lead to the danger of political isolation for the United States.

    苏联文学报发表专文评论
    大西洋公约国家已在分裂
    【新华社莫斯科七日电】文学报五日以《华盛顿的歇斯底里》为题发表专论，指出大西洋公约国家还没有巩固而就已在分裂。专论说：这些国家在远东问题上存在着意见的分歧。在重整军备的问题上，英国正在摇摆不定，并且企图摆脱美国的统制。法国人反对西德重新军事化。关于苏联就德国问题所提出的建议，美英法三国之间不曾达成真正的协议。当杜鲁门在十一月三十日的记者招待会上发表了威胁要扩大侵略的声明后，它们合作的危急方面就尖锐地表现了出来。
    专论又说：美国战争挑拨者希望迅速取得朝鲜战争的胜利，以便巩固北大西洋公约国家的团结，但是主观愿望的计划被粉碎了。美国在外交上犯了可悲的估计错误。美国在朝鲜挑起的战争，只促成了大西洋公约国家的进一步分崩离析，而这将导致美国在政治上处于孤立的危险。
