    China-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters
    Will Send Film Teams to Screen Movies in Various Locations
    [This newspaper reported] The China-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, in order to strengthen film propaganda, will organize film screening teams to screen movies in various locations. In the past year, the association has carried out film screenings nationwide and in some rural areas, which have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses. Practice has proved that screening Soviet films can easily and vividly introduce various aspects of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people.
    In order to continue expanding the educational impact of films and to enable the broad masses of rural China to have the opportunity to see Soviet films, the association plans to establish 54 film teams this year to work in various local China-Soviet Friendship Associations. The screening personnel for each team have now completed their training; the screening teams in Chahar, Pingyuan, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, Guilin, Jinan, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Xi'an and other places have received their projectors and can begin work immediately. The association is currently making overall arrangements to purchase projectors for other regions.

    中苏友好协会总会            
    将派电影队赴各地放映
    【本报讯】中苏友好协会总会，为加强电影宣传，将组织放映队分赴各地放映。在过去一年中，该会曾在全国范围内，及某些地区的乡村中进行了电影放映工作，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。在放映中证明：通过放映苏联电影能把苏联各方面的情况很容易而最生动地介绍给中国人民。
    该会为继续扩大电影教育影响，使中国广大农村都能有机会看到苏联电影，计划今年成立五十四个电影工作队，分驻各地中苏友好协会工作。现各队放映人员已经训练完毕；察哈尔、平原、绥远、山西、内蒙、江西、湖北、河南、桂林、济南、福州、兰州、西安等地放映队并已领得放映机，即可开始工作。其他地区放映机，该会正在统筹购买。
