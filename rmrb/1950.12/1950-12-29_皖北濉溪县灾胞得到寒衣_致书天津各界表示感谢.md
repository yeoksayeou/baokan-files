    Disaster-stricken People in Suixi County, Northern Anhui, Receive Winter Clothing; Send Letter to All Circles in Tianjin Expressing Gratitude
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The disaster-stricken compatriots in Suixi County, Northern Anhui Province, after receiving winter clothing, wrote a letter on December 10th to the Tianjin Municipal Winter Clothing Collection Committee to express their gratitude to the people from all walks of life who donated winter clothing. The original letter stated: "Due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breaching the Huayuankou and the Yellow River diverting into the Huai River, the rivers within the Huai River system were silted up. In addition, this year's heavy floods caused us to suffer an unprecedented disaster. Thousands of acres of fertile land were turned into swamps, and good crops were submerged at the bottom of the water. After the flood receded, fortunately, we received care from the People's Government, which distributed a large amount of seed grain and led us to replant late autumn crops, allowing us to survive under severe disaster. Since the beginning of winter, with wind and snow, we have received your enthusiastic donation of winter clothing, allowing us to be warm and engage in production. We hereby extend our infinite gratitude.
    We clearly know that the disasters inflicted upon us are the result of the long-term corrupt rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, aided by American imperialism, which led to the disrepair of the river channels. We also clearly know that it is our great people's leader Chairman Mao and the compatriots in neighboring regions who are saving us. In the future, we will certainly carry forward the spirit of production and support for the front lines during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War to actively engage in production, overcome the disaster, and support the front lines, in order to repay the government's concern and the care of the compatriots in neighboring regions. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the People's Government and with the support of neighboring regions, as long as we can actively engage in production and practice diligence and thrift, we will definitely be able to overcome the disaster."

    皖北濉溪县灾胞得到寒衣
    致书天津各界表示感谢
    【本报讯】皖北区濉溪县的受灾同胞，在领受寒衣以后，于十二月十日写信给天津市劝募寒衣委员会向捐献寒衣的各界人士致谢。原信称：“由于蒋匪扒开了花园口、黄水夺淮以后，淮河系统之内河淤塞，加之今年大水，使我们遭受到空前未有的灾荒，千顷良田变成泽国，大好庄稼覆没于水底。水退以后，幸蒙人民政府关怀，发放大批种粮，领导补种晚秋，使我们在灾荒严重下又能生存。入冬以来，风雪交加，承蒙你们热情捐助寒衣，使我们得以温暖，进行生产，特敬致无限的谢意。
    我们清楚地知道：加在我们身上的灾难，是美帝帮助之下的蒋介石匪帮长期的腐败统治，致使河道失修的结果。我们也清楚地知道：拯救我们的是伟大的人民领袖毛主席和友邻地区的同胞。我们今后一定本着过去在抗日战争中、解放战争中生产支前的精神来积极生产，战胜灾荒，支援前线，以报答政府的关怀和友邻地区同胞的照顾。我们坚信在人民政府的领导和邻区的支援下，只要能积极生产，勤俭节约，我们是一定能战胜灾荒的。”
