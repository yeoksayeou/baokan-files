Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: The Capital Returned Overseas Chinese Protest British Imperialist Persecution of Malayan Overseas Chinese Conference issued a Declaration Protesting British Imperialist Persecution of Malayan Overseas Chinese. The full text is as follows:

    We, over seven hundred returned overseas Chinese from various Southeast Asian countries now in Beijing, held a conference in the capital on December 4th to protest the British imperialist persecution of Malayan overseas Chinese. All of us returned overseas Chinese attending the conference unanimously believe that the British imperialists' planned, large-scale fascist persecution of Malayan overseas Chinese is unprecedented.

    In Malaya, British imperialists have arrested tens of thousands of innocent overseas Chinese, detaining them in concentration camps, prisons, and detention centers, subjecting them to cruel beatings, and then openly and secretly murdering them, or unreasonably deporting them.

    Due to the British Malayan colonial authorities' increasingly intensified persecution of local people and overseas Chinese, Malaya has long become a fascist prison of terror. British military police and secret service agencies have never been satisfied with issuing "detention warrants" for individual and minority arrests, but widely carry out mass arrests in towns and villages throughout Malaya, the mass arrest of entire schools and factories, and the mass search and arrest of entire streets. For example, in January 1949, British military police in Hainan Village, Johor, arrested the entire village of overseas Chinese, men, women, old and young, totaling more than 2,000 people, and all property and houses were set on fire and destroyed.

    Since June 24, 1948, when British imperialism began implementing the so-called "Emergency Regulations" in Malaya, it is impossible to count the number of overseas Chinese, regardless of gender, women, children, or the elderly, who have been illegally killed by the British colonial authorities. British-controlled newspapers in various parts of Malaya often publish records of killings in prominent positions. According to the British Colonial Under-Secretary's confession at the University of Leicester: within one year after the promulgation of this reactionary "Emergency Regulations" in Malaya, as many as five or six hundred overseas Chinese were publicly killed by the reactionary Malayan authorities. Incidents of insult, extortion, and rape of women by British troops against overseas Chinese in the Malayan interior are even more frequent, all exposing the fascist and brutal face of British imperialist colonialists.

    Since 1948, based on the number of overseas Chinese expelled by the British colonial authorities as sporadically announced, there have been more than 10,000 people. The British colonial authorities verbally ordered overseas Chinese to leave the country on a regular basis, which is the so-called "voluntary departure," and is not included in the scope of "expulsion" and "repatriation." During this period, the actual number of overseas Chinese unreasonably expelled by the British colonial authorities has been more than 35,000.

    As for the British imperialists' suppression of overseas Chinese public opinion, illegal closure of the Nanqiao Daily and Modern Daily; destruction of overseas Chinese education, armed encirclement and search of Singapore Chinese High School and Nanyang Girls' High School, as well as He Feng Xingzhong Middle School, and other crimes, are truly too numerous to mention.

    The barren mountains and wilderness of Malaya were opened up by overseas Chinese and local people with blood and sweat. When the Malayan British colonial army shamelessly surrendered en masse under the Japanese invaders' attack, it was the overseas Chinese and local people who first took up the weapons left behind by the British colonial army, rose up to resist the Japanese fascist invaders and persisted until the final victory. Overseas Chinese, like the local people, have inviolable and legitimate rights to survive in Malaya.

    The British imperialists' barbarous and unreasonable persecution of Malayan overseas Chinese is not only resolutely opposed by our 475 million people, but will inevitably arouse the opposition of all the people of Malaya and the British people. This conference unanimously resolves: to severely warn the British colonial authorities that they must immediately stop all crimes of persecuting Malayan overseas Chinese, and must immediately release the overseas Chinese who have been arrested. If the British colonial authorities continue their brutal, despicable, and shameless crimes of persecution against Malayan overseas Chinese, the British government shall bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    首都归国华侨抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨大会
    抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨宣言
    【新华社六日讯】首都归国华侨抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨大会发表抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨宣言，全文如下：
    我们从东南亚各国回到北京的华侨七百余人，于十二月四日在首都举行抗议英国帝国主义迫害马来亚华侨大会。我们到会的全体归侨，一致认为英国帝国主义对马来亚华侨有计划的大规模的法西斯迫害罪行，是史无前例的。
    英国帝国主义者在马来亚，成千累万地逮捕无辜华侨，把他们拘禁在集中营、监狱和拘留所里，加以惨酷的毒打，然后公开及秘密地加以杀害，或无理驱逐出境。
    由于英国马来亚殖民当局对当地人民和华侨日益加紧的迫害，马来亚早已变成法西斯的恐怖监狱。英国军警和特务机关，从来就不满足于发“拘留状”的个别的和少数的拘捕，而广泛地在马来亚各地城乡进行一个村镇、几个村镇的全体拘捕，整个学校和工厂的全体拘捕和成条街道的全体搜查与拘捕。如一九四九年一月间，英军警在柔佛海南村，一次即将全村华侨男女老幼共二千余人全部拘捕，财产房屋全部被纵火焚毁，即是一例。
    从一九四八年六月二十四日，英国帝国主义在马来亚开始实施所谓“紧急法令”时起，被英国殖民当局不分男女、妇孺老幼非法杀害的华侨，实无法统计。马来亚各地英国御用报纸，即经常以显著地位刊载杀人的纪录。仅据英殖民部次长在雷士德大学的自供：马来亚这一反动《紧急法令》颁布后的一年内，华侨被马来亚反动当局公开杀害的，就有五、六百名之多。马来亚内地英国军队，对于华侨的侮辱，勒索，强奸妇女事件，更层出不穷，在在都暴露了英帝国主义殖民者法西斯的凶残面目。
    在一九四八年以来，根据英国殖民当局零星公布的驱逐华侨的人数加以计算，就有一万余人。而英国殖民当局口头命令华侨定期出境，就是所谓“自愿出境”，不列入“驱逐”及“遣送”的范围之内的，尚未计算在内。在这期间，实际被英国殖民当局无理驱逐的华侨，已在三万五千人以上。
    至于英帝国主义压迫华侨舆论，非法封闭南侨日报和现代日报；摧残华侨教育，武装包围及搜查新加坡华侨中学和南洋女子中学，以及和丰兴中中学等，种种罪行，真是罄竹难书。
    马来亚的荒山旷野，是华侨与当地人民用血和汗开辟出来的。当马来亚英殖民军在日寇进攻下无耻地大举投降的时候，首先拿起英殖民军所放下的武器，起来反抗日本法西斯侵略者并坚持到最后胜利的，是华侨与当地的人民。华侨与当地人民一样，在马来亚有不可侵犯的正当生存权利。
    英帝国主义蛮横无理的迫害马来亚华侨，不但为我四万七千五百万人民所誓死反对，也必然会引起马来亚全体人民和英国人民的反对。本大会一致决议：严重警告英国殖民当局，必须立即停止迫害马来亚华侨的一切罪行，必须立即释放横遭拘捕的华侨，英国殖民当局，对马来亚华侨，倘仍继续其残暴、卑鄙、无耻的迫害罪行，英国政府对此所引起的一切后果，应负完全责任。

                                          一九五○年十二月四日
