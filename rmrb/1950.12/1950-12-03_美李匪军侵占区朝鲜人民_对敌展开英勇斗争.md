Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: The Korean people, unwilling to remain slaves, are bravely fighting the US-Li gangster troops occupying their hometowns. According to a report in the *Labor News* cited by the Korean Central News Agency: Kim Bong-seong, an employee living in the Sariwon area, crossed through enemy-occupied cities and villages and came to free Korea. He requested to join the People's Army to liberate his suffering compatriots. Kim Bong-seong spoke with grief and indignation about the situation in his hometown after it was occupied by the enemy:

    "After the American bandits occupied Sariwon on November 20th, they immediately began slaughtering, looting, and setting fires. They were green with envy when they saw the people of the North, and many innocent people in the villages were shot by them. Various democratic constructions built with the people's blood and sweat were destroyed by fire. At the same time, the American bandits brought out the reactionary landlords and restored the reign of terror.

    "However, patriotic Korean people organized themselves. Merchants went on strike, factories and enterprises stopped work, and young people took up weapons, sickles, and axes and went to the mountains to launch a heroic struggle against the enemy. Our group climbed to the rear of the enemy at night to destroy bridges and communication networks, and burn enemy military supplies. During the day, we hid in the deep mountains to discuss sabotage plans."

Korean farmers in the US-Li gangster occupied areas also launched a heroic struggle to attack enemy supply lines, deny the enemy a single grain of rice, and eliminate reactionary traitors. Lee Yong-chil and two other rural youths living in the Seokwang Temple District and Seogok District of Anbyeon County, Gangwon Province, escaped the enemy's encirclement in the Wonsan area at the end of October. They spoke of the Korean farmers' struggle to demand blood debts from the enemy:

    "After the Li Seung-man gangster troops arrived in our village, they looted our grain and livestock. Dozens of young people in our village seized the enemy's guns and killed all the enemies. We told the young people who remained in the village to bury the grain, and we left our hometown around October 26th.

    "We spent the night in a small village in Yongheung County. In the early morning, gunshots rang out in the neighboring village. The owner of the house said, "The people in the neighboring village repulsed the enemies who were looting grain and seized weapons. After attacking the enemy's vehicles and seizing a lot of military supplies, they all fled into the mountains. Now the enemy is attacking that village." We passed through Maengsan, Deokcheon, and other places. During the dozen or so days of our journey, we heard many similar struggles of Korean farmers."

    美李匪军侵占区朝鲜人民
    对敌展开英勇斗争
    【新华社一日讯】不愿再做奴隶的朝鲜人民，正对侵占他们家乡的美李匪军进行着勇敢的斗争。据朝鲜中央通讯社引《劳动新闻》的报道：住在沙里院地区的职员金奉成，穿过敌人侵占的城市和乡村，来到了自由的朝鲜。他要求加入人民军，去解放在苦难中的同胞。金奉成悲愤地谈起为敌人侵占后的家乡的情况说：
    “美国强盗在十一月二十日侵占了沙里院后，立刻开始屠杀、掠夺、放火。他们看见北半部人民就眼红，村庄中很多无辜人民被他们枪毙，用人民血汗所建造的各种民主建设被他们放火破坏。同时，美国强盗把反动地主抬出来，恢复恐怖统治。
    但是，爱国的朝鲜人民组织起来了。商人罢市，工厂、企业停工，青年们拿着武器、镰刀和斧头都上了山，和敌人展开了英勇的斗争。我们的小组夜晚爬到敌人的后方，去破坏桥梁、通讯网，烧毁敌人的军需物资，白天就隐蔽在深山里，讨论破坏计划。”
    在美李匪军侵占地区的朝鲜农民，也展开了袭击敌人供应线、不给敌人一粒米、肃清反动卖国贼的英勇斗争。住在江原道安边县释王寺区和瑞谷区的农村青年李容七等三人，十月底在元山地区逃出了敌人的包围。他们谈述朝鲜农民向敌人索还血债的斗争说：
    “李承晚匪军到了我们村庄以后，就掠夺我们的粮食和牲畜。我们同村的数十个青年就夺了敌人的枪，打死全部敌人。我们叫留在村中的青年把粮食埋好，就在十月二十六日前后离开了我们的故乡。
    我们在永兴县的一个小村中过了一夜。清晨，邻村响起了枪声。住处的主人说：“邻村的人打退了掠夺粮食的敌人，并且夺得了武器。他们在袭击了敌人的汽车，缴获很多军需物资后，都逃到山里去了。现在敌人在攻打那个村庄。”我们经过孟山、德川等地。在十几天的路途中，我们听到很多朝鲜农民的类似的斗争。”
