    Opening of the National Institute of Technology Technical Worker Class
    [This Newspaper's News] The National Institute of Technology held an opening ceremony on the 23rd for its pilot program of a regular technical worker class. The first class recruited 160 industrial workers from major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, and Tianjin; most have now arrived at the school and have been assigned to four departments: casting, metalworking, tooling, and heat treatment.
    All the students in the class wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing their gratitude for the opportunity to study. They pledged to study diligently, combine theory with practice, and strive to build a strong national defense and a free and happy New China. (Li Siyuan)
