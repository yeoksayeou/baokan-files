    Supervisory Committee Accepts Accusations from Yangtze River Navigation Bureau Staff
    Handling the Embezzlement Incident in Purchasing Sand Dredgers 
    Fugitive Shen Guocai is Wanted; Bureau Chiefs Lei Minzhi and Zhang Wenqi Ordered to Conduct Self-Criticism
    [Reported by this Newspaper] According to a circular from the People's Supervisory Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding the handling of embezzlement and waste cases in the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau's purchase of sand dredgers, on March 27th of this year, the Supervisory Committee received a letter signed "Several Staff Members of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau" reporting that a serious embezzlement and waste incident had occurred in the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau's purchase of sand dredgers, and that Section Chiefs Fu Qimin and Fan Zepu were perfunctory in their work and engaged in embezzlement and corruption. The Committee immediately sent a letter to the Central and Southern China People's Supervisory Committee requesting an investigation. Subsequently, the Ministry of Transport of the Central Government also sent personnel to investigate. Based on the inspection reports from the Central and Southern China People's Supervisory Committee and the Ministry of Transport, the People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government made appropriate dispositions. The facts concerning the purchase of sand dredgers and the embezzlement and corruption of Section Chief Fu Qimin and others are as follows:
    (1) The process of purchasing sand dredgers and the losses incurred. In October of last year, in order to "salvage sunken ships, increase shipping capacity, clear waterways, and ensure navigational safety," the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau hired experienced individuals from six shipping industry units, including the Shipping Industry Association and Sanbei Company, to establish the Central China Salvage Committee under the leadership of the Navigation Bureau. Shen Guocai, the factory director of the Sanbei Company's machinery plant, was also hired as a committee member. At the committee meeting, everyone agreed that salvage work could not be carried out without purchasing sand dredgers; and because Shen Guocai was the factory director of a machinery plant and had previously served as the manager of the Yangtze River Salvage Company, possessing experience in identifying machinery and salvage work, Shen Guocai was unanimously recommended to go to Shanghai to purchase them. When going to Shanghai for the purchase, the Bureau sent two people to manage the money and accounts, with Shen Guocai responsible for the technical aspects. Unexpectedly, Shen Guocai intentionally engaged in embezzlement, colluding with old friends to cheat, and actually purchased a used machine with old parts; moreover, it lacked essential components. Later, when the parts were assembled, the air compressor still produced more exhaust than intake, only maintaining 30 pounds of pressure, failing to meet the equipment's specified 250 pounds of air pressure, rendering it completely unusable for salvage operations. Shen Guocai's embezzlement can also be proven by the following facts: First, the machine lacked packaging and usage instructions. Second, the machine was an assemblage of parts from several companies. Third, during the assembly of parts in Shanghai, Shen asked his younger brother, Shen Guoliang, to deduct 20% of the storage fee from the Navigation Bureau (his brother ran a ship parts repair factory in Shanghai). Fourth, repairs at the Sanbei Company were one-third higher than market prices, and in some cases, as much as double. This incident resulted in a total waste of state funds amounting to 109.95 million RMB, equivalent to over 2,033 shi of rice.
    (2) The embezzlement, bribery, and irresponsible work of the two section chiefs, Fu Qimin and Fan Zepu: Fu Qimin, the Chief of the Administrative Section, had worked in the Yangtze River Navigation Administration for twelve years and had bad habits such as visiting prostitutes and accepting bribes. At the time of Liberation, Fu Qimin acted as the agent for the former Navigation Administration Director in handling the handover to us; after the takeover, he was retained as the Chief of the Administrative Section and concurrently served as the Director of the Secretariat of the Central China Salvage Committee. However, Fu Qimin's old habits have changed very little in the past year, and there are serious problems in his work. For example, last August, the private Fuxing Company's "Shoufeng" vessel drowned a passenger in Dongting Lake, and after the Yangtze River Daily forwarded the passenger's complaint, Fu Qimin failed to deal with it, only to be discovered during inspection work this April. In salvage work, Fu Qimin exposed the project budget and favored contractors. In addition, many people have reported that Fu Qimin also acted as a consultant for individual companies and received a "dry salary," with the Fuxing Company giving him a subsidy of 400,000 RMB per month, etc.; although this has not yet been verified, Fu Qimin has accepted hospitality and gifts from shipping merchants more than once. Fan Zepu, the Chief of the Vessel Section, was originally the Chief of the Technical Section and was transferred to his current position after Liberation. He is guilty of embezzlement and bribery, acting in outward compliance but inwardly defiant in his work, and failing to fulfill his responsibilities. For example, from June to November of last year, Fan Zepu led eleven members of the Vessel Section to collectively misappropriate public funds from inspection, measurement, and certificates, embezzling a total of 2.5 million RMB, of which Fan Zepu himself received a massive 1.93 million RMB. Fan Zepu also used his position to extort shipping merchants, etc.
    Based on the above facts, the People's Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government made the following analysis and dispositions: (1) Shen Guocai engaged in planned embezzlement and fraud, purchasing a useless old machine, resulting in a loss of 109.95 million RMB in state property. The Navigation Bureau should hand him over to the judicial authorities for processing and recover the losses. However, this individual has fled to escape punishment and should be placed on the wanted list according to the law and brought to justice. (2) Administrative Section Chief Fu Qimin and Vessel Section Chief Fan Zepu have failed to make progress in the year since Liberation, being perfunctory and irresponsible in their work, outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, embezzling and taking bribes, and favoring contractors, losing the position of a working staff member. They should be dismissed from their posts. (3) Bureau Chief Lei Minzhi and Deputy Bureau Chief Zhang Wenqi have achieved significant results in leading the work of the Navigation Bureau over the past year, such as supporting the front lines, organizing the resumption of navigation, and facilitating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas; and they have salvaged 49 sunken ships, greatly helping to clear waterways. However, Lei Minzhi spends most of his time in the office writing reports and making plans, without connecting with the masses. Zhang Wenqi is busy dealing with daily trivial matters. Both of these individuals have not done enough in-depth investigation and research work among the masses, their views on relying on the working class are not clear, they are not good at using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, and they have not firmly grasped the transformation and education of old personnel, allowing individual bad elements to exploit loopholes, causing losses to the people's property. Lei and Zhang have failed to fulfill their responsibilities and should be ordered to conduct profound self-criticism.

    监察委员会接受长江航务局职员控告
    处理购买冲沙机贪污事件 
    案犯沈国才已被通缉，局长雷敏之、张文奇着令检讨
    【本报讯】据中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会通报处理长江区航务局购买冲沙机等贪污浪费案件称：本年三月二十七日，监察委员会接到署名“长江区航务局数职员”来函报称：长江区航务局购买冲沙机发生严重的贪污浪费事件，科长傅起民、范泽溥工作敷衍，贪污腐化。该委员会当即函请中南区人民监察委员会进行检查。其后中央交通部亦派员前往检查。根据中南区人民监察委员会及交通部的检查报告，中央人民政府监察委员会作了适当处理。购买冲沙机及科长傅起民等的贪污腐化事实经过如下：
    （一）购买冲沙机的经过及损失情形。去年十月，长江区航务局为了“打捞沉没船舶，增加航运力量，清除航道，保证航运安全”，曾聘请轮船业公会，三北公司等六个航运业单位的有经验人士，在航务局领导下，成立了华中打捞委员会。三北公司机器厂厂长沈国才亦被聘为委员。该委员会开会时，大家认为非购买冲沙机不能进行打捞工作；并认为沈国才是机器厂厂长，又曾任扬子江打捞公司经理，对辨认机器及打捞工作都有经验，一致公推沈国才去上海购买。去沪购买时，该局派两个人管钱管账，技术方面由沈国才负责。不料沈国才蓄意贪污，勾结旧友共同作弊，竟购回一部配件旧机器；且缺主要零件。后来把零件配齐，而压气机仍是出气多，进气少，只能保持三十磅压力，达不到装备上规定的二五○磅气压，根本不能供打捞工程的使用。沈国才的贪污，由下列事实还可证明：一、机器没有包装包用单。二、机器是几家公司的凑合货。三、在上海装配零件当中，沈要他弟弟沈国良扣航务局百分之二十的存放费（其弟在沪开设一修配船舶零件厂）。四、机器在三北公司修理比市价高三分之一，有的高至一倍。这次事件，共浪费国家资财人民币一亿零九百九十五万元之巨。约合机米二千零三十三石余。
    （二）傅起明、范泽溥两科长贪污受贿及工作不负责任的情况：行政科长傅起明，原在长江区航政局工作十二年之久，有狎妓受贿等恶劣习惯。解放时，傅起明曾代理原航政局长向我办理移交事宜；接收后留任行政科长兼华中打捞委员会秘书主任。但傅起明一年来旧作风改变很少，工作上存在着严重问题。例如去年八月私营复兴公司“寿丰轮”航至洞庭湖淹毙一旅客，长江日报曾转去乘客控告后，傅起明不予处理，直到今年四月检查工作时，才被检查出来。在打捞工作中，傅起明暴露工程预算，偏袒包商。此外，许多人反映傅起明还给个别公司当顾问拿干薪，复兴公司每月津贴其四十万元等；虽尚未查明，但傅起明接受航商请客送礼等事，已不止一次。船舶科长范泽溥，原为技术科长，解放后调任现职。贪污受贿，工作上阳奉阴违，不尽责任。例如去年六月至十一月间，范泽溥带领船舶科十一名科员，集体挪用检查、丈量、证书等公款，共贪污二百五十万元，范泽溥本人得一百九十三万元之巨。以及范泽溥利用职权向航商勒索等等。
    中央人民政府人民监察委员会根据以上事实，作了如下的分析与处理：（一）沈国才有计划的贪污舞弊，购买不能用的旧机器，损失国家财产一亿零九百九十五万元，应由航务局移送司法机关处理，并追赔损失。惟该员已畏罪潜逃，应依法通缉归案。（二）行政科长傅起明，船舶科长范泽溥，解放一年来不求进步，对工作敷衍塞责，阳奉阴违，贪污受贿，偏袒包商，失掉工作人员立场，应予撤职。（三）局长雷敏之、副局长张文奇，领导航务局工作，一年来如支援前线、组织复航、沟通城乡物资交流，都有显著成绩；并打捞了沉船四九只，对疏通航运帮助很大。但雷敏之，多在办公室作报告，订计划，不联系群众。张文奇忙于处理日常细小事务。该二员对深入群众的调查研究工作均做的不够，对依靠工人阶级的观点不明确，不善于运用批评与自我批评的武器，没有抓紧对旧人员进行改造教育，使个别坏分子钻了空子，造成人民财产损失。雷张二员未克尽职责，应责令深刻检讨。
