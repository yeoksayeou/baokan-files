Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 12th: As of December 7th, the number of Christians across the country who have signed the Chinese Christian Reform Manifesto has reached 26,727. This includes the majority of leaders of church groups and a large number of believers in various regions. Christians who have signed the manifesto in various regions have unanimously expressed their determination to sever ties with imperialism and implement the principles of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation.

Since the launch of the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, many regional Christian churches have combined the signing campaign with it. The National Association of the Shanghai Chinese Christian Endeavor Society wrote a letter of condolence to Korean Christians, expressing solidarity with the Korean people in their just struggle against American aggression. Churches in Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, Haikou, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Hangzhou, Changsha, Wuhu, Suiyuan, and other places successively issued patriotic declarations and organized current affairs studies. The declarations in various regions unanimously emphasized supporting the just action of the people across the country to resist America and aid Korea, calling on believers to be doubly vigilant against the imperialist conspiracy to use religion for aggression. Christians in Hangzhou initiated the formulation of four patriotic covenants, calling on believers to eliminate pro-American thinking. The labor union and culture and education departments of various Christian organizations in Shanghai sponsored studies on understanding the nature of American imperialism and its history of aggression against China. In addition, pamphlets such as "What Christians Should Know About America" were published. At the Shanghai People's Representative Conference to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend Our Country held on the 5th of this month, Christian representative Wu Yaozong stated: "The frantic aggression of American imperialism has aroused widespread anger in religious circles. America claims to be a Christian country, but everything it does violates the doctrines of Christianity." He assured the conference: Religious circles must actively participate in the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, so that American imperialism has no foothold in China.

[This Newspaper Reports] One hundred and twelve Christian figures in Beijing signed and issued a declaration to resist America and aid Korea. On November 11th, more than 30 patriotic Christian figures in Beijing held a forum. At the meeting, everyone unanimously pointed out that Christians are a part of the people of the whole country. Today, when American imperialism is invading our Taiwan and Korea, and conspiring to expand the war of aggression, Christians must join the people of the whole country in participating in the great patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. First of all, we must implement the Christian Reform Manifesto into action to promote the early realization of the goals of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation of the church. After discussion, the meeting decided to solicit signatures from church members to issue a declaration to resist America and aid Korea. Signatories to the declaration included: Wang Zizhong (General Secretary of the North China Christian United Council), Wei Zhenyu (General Secretary of the Board of Directors of the North China Congregational Church of Christ in China), Shao Fengyuan (Chairman of the Hebei Association of the Church of Christ in China), Ling Xianyang (Bishop of the North China Diocese of the Anglican Church of China), Cai Yongchun (Professor of the School of Religion of Yenching University), Fang Kuangyu (same as above), Lu Ganchen (Director of the City Council Group of the National Association of the Young Men's Christian Association of China), Zhang Zirong (President of Daoji Hospital), Liu Weicheng (Director of General Affairs of Daoji Hospital), Qiu Lanxin (Chief Nurse and Principal of Daoji Advanced Nursing School of Daoji Hospital), and others, totaling one hundred and twelve people.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 12th: Christian figures in Guangzhou are launching various activities to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country in conjunction with the "Christian Reform Movement." The Guangdong Christian Council of Churches and the Guangzhou Christian Organizations United Association jointly held a meeting and passed the "Guangzhou Christian Covenant to Support World Peace and Oppose American Aggression," which includes: (1) Resolutely implement the National Christian Council of Churches' "Resolution on the Church Reform Movement" and actively solve the problems of the church's self-government, self-support, and self-propagation, and sever ties with American imperialism. (2) Be vigilant against the sabotage activities of American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents and report them at any time and any place. (3) Strengthen the study of New Democracy and current affairs, expose the rumors fabricated by American imperialism and secret agents, and eliminate pro-American and fear-of-America thinking. (4) Take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, and resolutely support the army, support the government, and support the land reform policy.

This covenant has been warmly supported by Christians in Guangzhou. More than 600 people from Christian organizations in the city held a conference on the 3rd of this month. At the meeting, everyone unanimously responded to the church reform movement and the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and called on Christians throughout the city to sign the "Covenant to Support World Peace and Oppose American Imperialist Aggression." In order to strengthen learning, Christian organizations throughout the city have formed the "Guangzhou Christian Staff New Knowledge Learning Group," and many missionaries and pastors have enthusiastically participated. Hu Yiyun, General Secretary of the Guangdong Christian Council of Churches, Zhao Guanhai, Vice President of the Guangzhou Christian Organizations United Association, Tan Woxin, President of the Xiehe Theological Seminary of Lingnan University, Wang Yidun, General Secretary of the Guangzhou Young Men's Christian Association, and other 27 Christian representatives jointly issued a statement exposing the historical activities of imperialism using religion for aggression; and called on Christians throughout the province to unite closely, be doubly vigilant, and prevent American-Chiang Kai-shek bandits and secret agents from infiltrating church activities.
