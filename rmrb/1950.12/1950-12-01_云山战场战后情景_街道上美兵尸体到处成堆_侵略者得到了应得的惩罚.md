Xinhua News Agency, A Certain Place in Northern Korea, 29th: Our correspondent reported on the scene after inspecting the Yunshan area after the battle, saying: After the battle of Yunshan, the reporter rushed there despite the heavy rain. The forests on the mountains near Yunshan were still burning in the heavy rain, as the American invading army had set fire to the mountains in a frenzy before their retreat. The houses along the road were also burning. All along the way were weapons, ammunition, helmets, letters... abandoned by the American invading army. Destroyed American military vehicles were overturned by the roadside.

Yunshan was originally a county town with more than 300 households, but now it is impossible to find a single complete house. Ninety-five percent of the buildings in the whole city have become piles of rubble.

The American invaders are destroying the cities, land, and mountains of Korea, but they cannot save themselves from defeat, and they will receive the punishment they deserve here.

A soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who participated in the battle of Yunshan told the reporter that when they fought into Yunshan, the whole city was almost a sea of fire, and the burning corpses emitted a pungent odor, and thick smoke filled the air everywhere. Next to the destroyed American tanks and on the streets, there were piles and piles of American soldiers' corpses. The soldier continued, saying that the American soldiers were terrified when they made their dying struggles. To boost their courage, these American soldiers gathered together, so they were in piles of two, or piles of twenty or thirty, and were killed here. The soldier said: In the instant before the fate of death befell these victims of the invaders, some desperately crawled under the cars, some climbed onto the cars, some ran away with their feet, and some shrank into a ball. Many of the American soldiers who were killed were barefoot.

However, the American soldiers who resolutely laid down their weapons were the lucky ones.

On the road to Yunshan, we were met by large trucks and jeeps full of spoils of war, and these vehicles were also spoils of war. Behind the vehicles were groups of American prisoners of war. Most of them were bareheaded, because their hats were lost in the tense battle. Many of them were still wearing summer clothes, some draped in military blankets, and the aftermath of the battle and the cold made them shiver. But because they laid down their weapons, they saved their lives and received proper care from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and were sent to the rear collection stations.

    云山战场战后情景
    街道上美兵尸体到处成堆  侵略者得到了应得的惩罚
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十九日电】迟到：本社记者报道巡视战后云山地区的情景称：云山的战斗结束后，记者冒着大雨赶到了那里。云山附近的山上的树林，还在大雨中燃烧，美国侵略军在溃退前大肆放火烧山。道旁的房屋也正在燃烧着。一路上尽是美国侵略军遗弃下的武器、弹药、钢盔、信件……被击毁了的美国军车翻倒在道旁。
    云山原是一个有三百多户的县城，现在已找不到一所完整的房屋。全城百分之九十五的建筑已成为瓦砾堆。
    美国侵略者毁灭着朝鲜的城市，土地，山林，可是挽救不了他自己的失败，他们也就要在这里得到应得的惩罚。
    曾经参加云山战斗的中国人民志愿部队的一位战士告诉记者说：他们打进云山的时候，全城几乎是成为一片火海，火烧着尸体发出刺鼻的臭味，到处都弥漫着浓烟。在打坏了的美国坦克旁边和街道上，有着一堆一堆的美国兵的尸体。这位战士接着说，美国兵在作垂死的挣扎时恐惧万状，为了壮胆，这些美国兵都聚集在一起，他们就是这样两个人一堆，二、三十个人一堆，被打死在这里了。这位战士说：在死亡的命运降临到这些侵略者牺牲品头上的前一霎那，他们有的拚命往汽车底下钻，有的往车上爬，有的拔脚飞跑，有的缩成一团，被打死的美国兵中还有很多是赤着脚的。
    但是，果敢地放下武器的美国兵，他们就是幸运的人们了。
    在记者走往云山的路上迎面而来的是满载着战利品的大卡车和吉普，这些车辆也是战利品。在车辆后面是一群一群的美国俘虏。他们大部分光着头，因为帽子在紧张的战斗中丢掉了。他们很多人还穿着夏季的服装，有的披着军毯，战斗的余悸和寒冷使得他们发抖。可是由于他们放下了武器，他们就保全了自己的性命，并且得到了中国人民志愿部队妥善的照顾，被送到后方的收容所去。
