To the editor:

　　After returning from the meeting in Beijing, I gave reports in various fields of our mine, mobilizing everyone to increase production. In the recent wave of patriotic production competitions, many of our workers have demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, and their practical actions to increase production have powerfully struck at the American aggressors. Our entire field completed 105% of the annual task ahead of schedule on November 18. In the patriotic production competition, 14 model groups emerged in our field, and their production exceeded the plan by more than 50%. In the future, we will create more model groups. In our work, we will not only pay attention to quantity but also to quality and safety.

　　Zhang Wenhan, Labor Model Representative of the Northeast Gongchangling Dashigou Mining Field

    全场提前完成了全年生产任务编辑同志：
    我自北京开会回来，即在我矿各场作报告，动员大家把生产提高一步。在最近开展的爱国主义生产竞赛的浪潮中，我们很多工友发挥了高度的爱国热忱，以提高生产的实际行动，有力地打击美国侵略者。我们全场于十一月十八日提前完成了全年任务的百分之一百零五。在爱国主义生产竞赛中，我场又出现了十四个模范小组，他们生产都超过计划百分之五十以上。今后，我们将会创造更多的模范小组。我们在工作中不单注意数量而且要注意质量，注意安全。
