    Industrial and Commercial Circles in East China
    Sign Patriotic Pacts One After Another
    Haikou Industrial and Commercial Circles Hold Forum on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    [This newspaper reports] The movement to sign patriotic pacts continues to unfold among industrial and commercial circles in various parts of East China. On the 23rd of last month, leading figures from the industrial and commercial sectors of Songjiang City, Southern Jiangsu, held a "Symposium on Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Defending the Homeland" under the auspices of the city's Federation of Industry and Commerce. At the meeting, seven patriotic pacts were formulated, with the main content being to contribute all efforts to ensure no speculative activities; to prevent tax evasion, tax loopholes, and tax arrears, and to call on all 1,700 industrial and commercial households in the city to implement them as one. The five patriotic pacts of the Wuxi industrial and commercial circles also stipulate the resolute implementation of government policies and regulations, ensuring stable prices, opposing hoarding and speculation and all illegal acts that disrupt the market, as well as actively paying taxes to ensure national fiscal revenue. Representatives from the Danyang industrial and commercial circles also formulated patriotic pacts of a similar nature, guaranteeing to promote them to all industrial and commercial households. The patriotic pacts of the industrial and commercial circles in Yangshe Town, Jiangyin, in addition to guaranteeing no speculation and no tax evasion, also guarantee active operation, facing the countryside, and striving for the development of production. The grain and flour industry in Xuzhou City, Shandong Province, stipulated in their drafted nine patriotic pacts "Comply with the scope of business and do not operate outside the industry" and "Comply with transaction rules; transactions of grain exceeding 200 jin and flour exceeding five bags must be completed within the exchange," etc. The Fuzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce held an enlarged meeting on November 27, attended by more than 220 representatives from various industries. In addition to passing a declaration to resist America, aid Korea, and defend the homeland, they also formulated five patriotic pacts, calling on more than 12,000 industrial and commercial households in the city to thoroughly implement them. In addition to fully supporting the movement to resist America and aid Korea and not listening to rumors from American and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, the content of the pacts also resolutely supports the Ministry of Trade's several instructions on banning speculative commerce; labor-capital unity, doing a good job in production, and strengthening their own organizations, etc. The actions of industrial and commercial circles in various places in signing agreements one after another show the improvement of the industrial and commercial circles' understanding of current affairs, stimulate patriotism, and support the people's government's financial measures with practical actions. However, there are also a few industrialists and businessmen who are not sufficiently aware and do things that violate the agreement. For example, the Nanjing Coal Industry Association voluntarily formulated four patriotic pacts on the 10th of last month, guaranteeing "no hoarding, no transfer of quota purchases, and no private price increases." However, recently, under normal coal supply conditions, 30 to 40 percent of coal dealers still failed to post prices for sale at the prescribed prices, and it was discovered that four or five coal dealers had privately increased prices and hoarded coal for refusal to sell. This phenomenon must be corrected quickly.
    Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 11th - Haikou City, the commercial center of Hainan Island, held a city-wide forum for industrial and commercial circles on resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the homeland on the 9th. More than 600 people from the industrial and commercial sectors attended the meeting, representing a total of 1,594 households in 22 industries. In addition to enthusiastically discussing current affairs, the delegates passed a resolution endorsing the joint declaration of the democratic parties and Foreign Minister Zhou's repeated protests to the United Nations against the United States' aggression against Korea and China, and unanimously passed a patriotic pact to resist America and aid Korea, as a guideline for future action.
    In order to strengthen the study of current affairs, the industrial and commercial circles in the city automatically organized a study committee in the middle of last month, and are currently展开ing a widespread movement to study current affairs.

    华东各地工商业界
    纷纷签订爱国公约
    海口市工商界座谈抗美援朝
    【本报讯】签订爱国公约的运动，继续在华东各地工商界中开展。苏南松江市工商界负责人于上月二十三日，在该市工商联主持下举行“抗美援朝保家卫国座谈会”，会上，订出七项爱国公约，主要内容为贡献一切力量，保证不做投机活动；制止逃税、漏税、欠税，号召全市一千七百户工商业者，一体实行。无锡市工商界的五项爱国公约亦规定要坚决执行政府政策法令，保证稳定物价，反对囤积居奇及扰乱市场的一切不法行为，以及踊跃纳税，确切保证国家财政收入。丹阳工商界代表也订立了同样性质的爱国公约，保证推动到全体工商户中去。江阴杨舍镇工商界的爱国公约，除了保证不投机、不逃漏税外，还保证积极经营，面向农村，为发展生产而努力。山东省徐州市的粮面业，他们所拟订的九条爱国公约中规定“遵守营业范围，不经营业外商品”、“遵守交易规则，粮食超过二百市斤面粉五袋者，一定在交易所内成交”等。福州市工商联曾于十一月二十七日召开扩大会议，出席各行业代表二百二十余人，会上除通过抗美援朝保家卫国宣言外，亦订出了五条爱国公约，号召全市一万二千余户工商业者彻底执行。公约内容除要全力支援抗美援朝运动，不听信美蒋特务谣言外，并坚决拥护中央贸易部所发布的关于取缔投机商业的几项指示；劳资团结，搞好生产及加强自己的组织等。各地工商界相继签约的行动，表现了工商界对时事认识的提高，激发了爱国心，以实际行动拥护人民政府的财政措施。但也有少数工商业者觉悟不够，做出违反公约的事情。如南京煤业公会，在上月十日曾自动订立四项爱国公约，保证“不囤积居奇、不转让套购、不私抬价格”，但最近，在燃煤供应正常的情况下，仍有十分之三、四的煤号未按规定价格挂牌出售，并且发现四、五家煤号有私抬价格、囤积拒售行为。这种现象必须迅速改正。
    【新华社海口十一日电】海南岛商业中心海口市，于九日举行全市工商界抗美援朝保家卫国座谈会。出席该会的工商业界共六百余人，代表了二十二个行业共一千五百九十四户。与会代表除热烈讨论时事问题外，通过了决议拥护各民主党派的联合宣言和周外长历次向联合国控诉美国侵略朝鲜和中国的抗议书，并一致通过抗美援朝爱国公约，作为今后行动纲领。
    为了加强时事学习，该市工商业界已于上月中自动组织了学习委员会，目前正在展开广泛的学习时事运动。
