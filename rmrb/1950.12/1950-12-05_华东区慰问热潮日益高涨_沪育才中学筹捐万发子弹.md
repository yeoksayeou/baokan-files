    [This newspaper] News - The wave of support from the people of Eastern China is rising daily. The tens of millions of letters of support from all walks of life in Shanghai are filled with love and care for the heroic soldiers. The letter of support from all workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company stated: We are determined to support you by eliminating accidents, improving production, strengthening winter protection, and ensuring safe power generation. The letter of support from all educational workers in Shanghai wrote: We are using countless facts and materials of American aggression against China to educate the vast number of young students, so as to arouse contempt and hatred for the American bandits from the bottom of their hearts. We will kill the enemy on the ideological front, leaving not a single piece of armor, just as you will surely win a complete victory on the Korean battlefield. While writing letters of support, schools, institutions, and citizens donated a large number of慰劳品 (comfort items). Yucai Middle School launched the "10,000 Rounds of Ammunition Donation Movement." They put forward the slogan "Donate a bullet, eliminate an invading soldier." The Minzhi Journalism School has initiated a "One Person, One Bag" comfort campaign.

They also guaranteed to make the cotton-padded coats well and quickly, so that every soldier can wear them, without seams opening or buttons falling off, and warmly protect the national defense.
    Within ten days, the Wannan Daily in Wuhu City, Southern Anhui Province, has received more than 500 letters of support entrusted by all walks of life. Every word of the letters of support is filled with the supreme respect of our people for the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the infinite anger towards the American invading bandits.
    All the female workers of the Xianshi Cigarette Factory in Yangzhou City, Northern Jiangsu Province, wrote a letter to comfort the Korean women, saying: "Dear sisters: The insults and harms that American imperialism has inflicted on you are equivalent to the insults and harms inflicted on us, and your pain is our pain. Let us unite like steel to kill this mad dog of American imperialism." All the staff of the Municipal Local Industry Committee said in a letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: "We, all the workers, vow to be your backing. We are carrying out competitions on production posts, strengthening national defense and economic strength, and defending the motherland."
