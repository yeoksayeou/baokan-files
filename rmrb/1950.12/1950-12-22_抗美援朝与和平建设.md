Resisting America and Aiding Korea and Peaceful Construction
Di Chaobai

I
Due to the victory of the Chinese people's anti-American and anti-Chiang war, a total of 836 million people worldwide have broken away from the sphere of influence of imperialism and formed a powerful camp of peace and democracy led by the Soviet Union. This is a huge change in human history. This change has greatly altered the power relationship between the two major camps of the imperialist system and the socialist (including people's democracy) system. The sphere of influence of imperialism is feeling increasingly constrained, and its internal contradictions are expanding day by day. The aggressive group headed by US imperialism is trying to find a way out through wars of aggression. They are unscrupulously supporting and arming reactionaries in various countries in Europe and Asia. They plan to launch wars in the East and West while the people's democratic countries are engaged in peaceful construction.

In a world where imperialism still exists, it is impossible for us to achieve peace without paying a price, and it is impossible to carry out peaceful construction without going through a struggle with imperialism. After the revolution, the Soviet Union went through a brutal war with imperialist aggressors before consolidating the Soviet regime and being able to carry out peaceful construction. The world economic crisis of 1929 prompted the three imperialist countries of Japan, Italy and Germany to launch wars of aggression, and finally to attack the Soviet Union, causing serious damage to the socialist construction of the Soviet Union.

The lessons history teaches us are very clear: imperialism will not abandon its attempts at armed aggression unless it suffers a heavy blow. And the economic crisis of capitalism is the internal driving force that prompts imperialism to take risks.

II
The People's Republic of China has only been established for a little over a year. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the people of the whole country have made great achievements in all aspects by making use of this short period of peace and working hard. In terms of finance and economy, unified financial revenue and expenditure and cash management were implemented nationwide, enabling the country to achieve near-balance in state revenue and expenditure in the first year after the military was just finished on the mainland; the inflation that had lasted for more than ten years was basically stopped, the value of the Renminbi was stabilized, and prices suddenly stabilized; this stability has been tested twice by the US imperialist invasion of Korea and our people's volunteer assistance to Korea against US aggression, and has proven its solidity. Since the adjustment of industry and commerce and public-private relations after May, the relationship between the public and private sectors has become closer, the production and sales of major industrial products have approached equilibrium, labor-management relations have become more normal under the principle of benefiting both parties, the situation of private industrial and commercial enterprises has rapidly improved, and the vitality of the rural economy after the autumn harvest is unprecedented since 1936. In terms of investment in industry, mining, transportation, farmland and water conservancy, nearly 700 million US dollars will be invested this year, which has played a significant role in the restoration and increased production of the national economy. The production of various important industries and mines can mostly be completed ahead of schedule, and the total value of industrial and mining production in the Northeast region is close to the level of 1943. The national grain production completed and exceeded the task of increasing production by 10 billion catties, and cotton production increased by 56% compared with last year. Therefore, our grain and major industrial raw materials for next year have reached the point of being sufficient for food and use. The above are only some of the main gains in the financial and economic sector. Although these gains cannot be considered satisfactory, they have paved the way for the restoration and development of the national economy in the future; we need peace, we need a peaceful environment to continue to engage in our construction work, so that our people who have suffered from the pain of war for a long time can gradually enjoy a prosperous and happy life from now on.

However, facts have proved that US imperialism will never allow us to enjoy peace and engage in construction. Our achievements in such a short period of time are in stark contrast to the development of the economic crisis that US imperialism began in October 1948. In order to escape its crisis, US imperialism needs to undermine the peace of other countries and needs to risk launching wars of aggression. Therefore, its expansionist policy in the Pacific has gradually approached our national border. At the same time as the attack on North Korea, the Seventh Fleet invaded our Taiwan territorial waters, stepped up the arming of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and organized a large number of secret agents and bandits to enter our mainland to carry out sabotage activities. In Vietnam, it sent a military delegation and weapons to support the French reactionaries. MacArthur mobilized all its Far East forces and, regardless of all calls for peace and our protests, resolutely wanted to enslave the entire Korea and push the war to the Yalu River.

The US imperialist attempt to encircle us militarily from Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, to coerce and undermine our peaceful construction, and to restore Chiang Kai-shek is very obvious. We cannot sleep soundly snoring next to the enemy's war drums. US imperialism is gradually deploying its naval, land and air force bases, attempting to use the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to re-attack the Chinese mainland, and arming the Korean reactionaries and Japanese fascist remnants to attack our Northeast. Therefore, today, if we tolerate the US imperialist occupation of Korea and Taiwan as strategic bases, tomorrow they will be bases for attacking the Chinese mainland.

We can no longer allow another imperialist to stand at our door, or even step in with one foot, flaunting his power and training troops and opening naval bases; when they are all ready, we will have to bite the bullet and take a beating. In the past, the Japanese imperialists were able to arm a million Kwantung Army because they had been firmly entrenched in the Northeast for six years. This army not only turned our entire country into a battlefield for bloody battles for eight years, but also only relied on the Soviet Union's participation in the war to completely eliminate the Kwantung Army. The painful lessons of history are very profound for us. Today's US imperialists are materially stronger than the Japanese imperialists, and their actions in preparing for war and expanding their army are even more insane than those of the old Japanese imperialists. Once they are ready, they can use the UN voting machine to launch aggression against any region in the world at any time. Therefore, the peace we need, the revolutionary achievements we need to maintain, must be obtained from the struggle against the US imperialists' crazy aggression. We must make the imperialists withdraw their aggressive troops and make their aggression plans bankrupt before they have completed their preparations for larger-scale aggression. We must make our neighbors no longer be used by the imperialists as bases for aggression, but instead become a barrier to peace. Only then can we be considered to have won peace and be able to engage in long-term peaceful construction.

III
The environment of the Chinese revolution determined that after our domestic war ended on the mainland and before we reached the stage of long-term peaceful construction, the people of the whole country must be prepared for such a period: during this period, we must use our main strength to remove the imperialists' aggression and threats against us, establish a solid national defense to protect our peaceful construction, and at the same time mobilize all public and private forces to restore our national economy and prepare conditions for long-term peaceful construction.

What the era has given us is a dual struggle task: on the one hand, we are forced to engage in a sharp struggle with imperialism, and on the other hand, we continue to restore the national economy. These two are not contradictory, but unified; and we have sufficient conditions and full confidence to successfully complete this dual task.

Although we are forced to engage in a sharp struggle with imperialism, which requires us to spend some of our manpower and material resources, this is the price we must pay to consolidate our victory and eliminate future troubles. It is much less costly to pay this price now than to pay it in the future. If we gradually tolerate the aggression of imperialism, sit idly by while imperialism carves up our neighbors, occupies our Taiwan, and supports the reactionary forces in these places as tools for its aggression against China, and then wait for imperialism to choose an opportunity to engage in a large-scale fight with us, this is what we do not want and is unwise. The result of this is not the victory of peace but the victory of war, which will cause greater sacrifices to the Chinese people and the working people of the world. If the forces of peace are to defeat war, they must continue to eliminate the seeds of war in all aspects, break the spears of the aggressors, and continuously weaken the forces of the war group and continuously increase the forces of the peace group. This is the road for peace to defeat war, and it is also the road for us to prevent the Third World War and enter the stage of peaceful construction as soon as possible.

It is precisely in order to carry out peaceful construction as soon as possible that we must give a ruthless blow to the US imperialists' arrogant aggression at this moment. Do we have the strength to carry out this struggle and have the confidence to win? Yes! We have 475 million united people, we have a powerful People's Liberation Army, we have an economic foundation that is not strong but very solid, and finally we have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been tempered and tested, and the unity of the people of the whole country. These conditions give us full confidence to combine the forces of peace and democracy in the world to achieve victory in the struggle against US imperialism. Although US imperialism has some material advantages, this cannot guarantee the victory of the war of aggression. Victory is ultimately determined by the broad masses of the people. World War II proved this, the Chinese revolution's elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's and the US' eight million reactionary troops proved this, and the recent development of the Korean war also proved this. Therefore, the Chinese people's resistance to US aggression and assistance to Korea will inevitably help the liberation of the Korean people and defeat the US imperialist aggressors, and make great contributions to the cause of peace.

The struggle against US imperialist aggression is the struggle of our people to forever get rid of imperialist oppression and achieve lasting peace. This struggle is a necessary process in our revolutionary process, and this struggle is closely related to our cause of peaceful construction. The victory of this struggle is the beginning of all long-term construction undertakings and guarantees that they will no longer be destroyed.

IV
At present, we cannot be sure how long the struggle against US imperialist aggression will continue and to what extent it will develop. Because the power to expand the war and persist in aggression is in the hands of the imperialists. However, we can be sure that no matter to what extent this struggle evolves, our national economy will continue to recover and develop appropriately on the existing basis. The reasons are:

First, agriculture and handicraft industry account for 90% of the total national output value. The development of agriculture and handicraft industry is mainly due to the increased enthusiasm of farmers for production, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the expansion of farmers' investment in production after the land reform. With the completion of land reform in the new areas with a population of more than 130 million this winter and next spring, it can be guaranteed that the agricultural production situation in 1951 will be better than this year. The government's investment in necessary farmland and water conservancy will continue to be made regardless of the current situation. The quantity of various agricultural specialties for export will increase year by year because we have concluded extensive trade agreements with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, even if imperialism imposes a blockade on us, it will not be seriously affected.

Second, private industrial and commercial enterprises have been recovering and prospering this year with the help of the government and under the favorable conditions of stable prices and convenient transportation, along with the rise in agricultural production. These favorable conditions will not only continue to exist in 1951, but will also develop further. The processing orders for private industries may be further expanded than this year. Due to the gradual increase in rural purchasing power, inland trade will become more prosperous. The path for private capital to invest in the inland is unimpeded. The imperialists' blockade of certain materials against us is enough to strengthen our determination and accelerate the development of all sectors of our national economy on the basis of independence and self-sufficiency.

Third, the state-owned industrial and mining enterprises that lead our country's industrialization have made significant achievements in the past year. Generally, they have been able to carry out expanded reproduction with the existing funds and human resources. The threat of imperialist wars of aggression will cause us to stop the expansion of industry and mining in certain areas, but we will accelerate the expansion in other areas and in certain important industrial and mining sectors. The result will be to promote the regional distribution of industry, mining and transportation to become more balanced, and to accelerate the rational supplementation and adjustment of the industrial structure.

Fourth, the state's trade and financial institutions have a better foundation for regulating and controlling the market. Under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, it is entirely possible and necessary to control important materials, consolidate prices, and further organize the market, organize urban and rural cooperatives, and organize the various links of production, transportation, sales and consumption step by step, so that state trade can play a greater regulatory role in the process of national economic recovery. The rational organization of the market will guarantee that our public and private trade can cope with any situation, and put the development of private industrial and commercial enterprises on a more solid foundation.

Fifth, the enthusiasm of the working people of the whole country for production is the basic driving force for the development of our national economy. The enthusiastic production movement carried out by the working class in various sectors such as industry, agriculture, and transportation has greatly increased the speed of economic development. This harvest is not due to the progressive scientific production management system, but mainly due to the change in the workers' attitude towards labor and their love for the new regime. After the start of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, industrial and agricultural workers in Northeast and North China launched a new production upsurge. This is our unshakable force. This force makes us firmly believe that we can cope with any imperialist provocations in terms of production and guarantee that our national economy can cope with ease and continue to develop under any difficult circumstances.

The above is to explain the basic situation that although we cannot immediately carry out long-term peaceful construction, our national economy can still continue to recover and develop. Comparing our situation with the deepening of the crisis in imperialist countries and the chaos caused by war preparations clearly shows the superiority of our new democratic economic system. The high concentration of industry in imperialist countries and the development of acute class contradictions and the contradictions between the suzerain state and the colonies may cause them to collapse rapidly in a large-scale war, which is precisely the anxiety of the imperialists in the war of aggression. However, as long as they expand the war step by step, this fate is bound to await them.

    抗美援朝与和平建设
    狄超白
    一
    由于中国人民反美蒋战争的胜利，全世界先后已有八亿三千六百万人口脱离了帝国主义的势力范围，并结成以苏联为首的和平民主的强大阵营，这是人类历史上巨大的变革。这一变革使得帝国主义体系及社会主义（包括人民民主主义）体系的两大阵营之间的力量对关系大大改变了，帝国主义的势力范围日感穷蹙，其内部的矛盾则逐日扩大，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团正企图从侵略战争中找寻出路，他们在欧亚两洲肆无忌惮地扶植并武装各国反动派，他们打算在东西两方，当人民民主国家和平建设正在进行的过程中即行发动战争。
    在还有帝国主义存在的世界里，我们就不可能无代价的取得和平，并不可能不经过与帝国主义的斗争就能够进行和平建设。苏联在革命后曾与帝国主义侵略军进行了残酷战争才巩固了苏维埃政权，得以进行和平建设。一九二九年的世界经济恐慌促使日意德三个帝国主义发动侵略战争，最后则进攻苏联，使苏联的社会主义建设遭受了严重的破坏。
    历史提示给我们的教训是很鲜明的：帝国主义不遭受沉重的打击，他是不会放弃其武装侵略的企图的。而资本主义的经济危机，是促使帝国主义挺而走险的内在动力。
    二
    中华人民共和国刚建立只有一年多的时间，全国人民在中央人民政府的领导之下，利用了这暂短的和平时间，努力工作，各方面都有了伟大的成就。在财政经济方面，在全国范围内统一了财政收支和现金管理，使在军事刚自大陆上结束的第一年就做到国家收支的接近平衡；基本上停止了十几年来的通货膨胀，稳定了人民币的币值，使物价骤然平稳下来；这种稳定经过美帝侵朝及我人民的志愿抗美援朝的两次考验而证明其巩固。自五月以后调整工商业及公私关系以后，公私关系更其密切了，主要工业品的产销已接近平衡，劳资关系在两利的原则下相处更趋正常，私营工商业的情况迅速好转起来，秋收后农村经济的活跃是一九三六年以来所未有的。在工矿交通农田水利的投资方面，本年度投下将及七亿美元，对于国民经济的恢复与增产起了显著的作用，各种重要工矿生产大部可以超计划完成，东北区的工矿生产总值接近于一九四三年的水平了。全国粮食生产完成并超过了增产一百亿斤的任务，棉花较去年增产百分之五十六，因此我们明年度的粮食及主要工业原料已达到足食足用的地步。以上这些仅是财政经济部分的一些主要收获，这些收获虽决不能认为满足，但已为今后国民经济的恢复和发展填平了道路；我们需要和平，我们需要和平的环境来继续从事我们的建设工作，使我们长期遭受战争痛苦的人民能从此逐步享受富裕与幸福的生活。
    然而事实证明：美帝国主义是决不让我们享受和平从事建设的。我们在短短的时期之内有这样的成就，正与美帝国主义自一九四八年十月即行开始的经济危机的发展适成对照，美帝国主义为了脱逃其危机，就需要破坏他国的和平，就需要冒险发动侵略战争，因此，它在太平洋里的扩张政策就逐步迫近我国国境，与进攻北朝鲜同时，第七舰队侵入我台湾领海，加紧武装蒋介石匪帮，组织了大批的特务土匪进入我内地进行破坏活动，在越南则派遣了军事使节团及武器支援法国反动派，麦克阿瑟动员了其全部远东的兵力，不顾一切和平的呼吁和我们的抗议，坚决要奴役整个朝鲜，并把战争推向鸭绿江边。
    美帝国主义从朝鲜，从台湾，从越南对我进行军事的大包围，胁迫破坏我和平建设，并要使蒋介石复辟的企图是很显然的，我们不能安睡在敌人的战鼓的旁边打鼾。美帝国主义逐步部署其海陆空军基地，企图利用蒋介石匪帮重新攻入中国大陆，并武装朝鲜反动派及日本法西斯余孽来进攻我东北。所以今天如容忍美帝侵占朝鲜台湾来作为战略基地，明天就是进攻中国大陆的根据地。
    我们决不能再容许另一个帝国主义者站在我们的门口，甚至一脚已跨入门内，在那里耀武扬威地训练部队和开辟海军基地；等他们一切都准备好了的时候，我们就硬着头皮挨打。过去日本帝国主义者因在东北稳据六年之久，所以能武装了百万关东军，这支军队不仅使我们全国沦为战场血战达八年之久，最后且只有依靠苏联的参战，才能把关东军彻底消灭。历史的惨痛教训对我们是很深刻的，现在的美帝国主义者在物质方面既较日本帝国主义者为强，其备战和扩军的行动较之旧日的日本帝国主义者更为疯狂，且一旦准备就绪，随时可以利用联合国的表决机器向世界任何地区进行侵略。因此，我们所需要的和平，我们所需要保持的革命成果，必须从反对美帝国主义疯狂侵略的斗争中来求得，必须使帝国主义者撤走他们的侵略军队，使他们在更大规模的侵略准备还未完成的时候即行使他们的侵略计划遭受破产，使我们的邻邦不再被帝国主义利用作为侵略基地，相反的成为和平的屏障，然后我们才能算是赢得和平，才能从事长期的和平建设。
    三
    中国革命的环境决定了，在我们国内战争在本土结束以后，到达进行长期的和平建设阶段之间，全国人民还必须准备有这样一个时期：这个时期我们要拿出主要的力量来解除帝国主义者对我们的侵略与威胁，建立巩固的国防以保障我们的和平建设，同时又要动员一切公私力量来恢复我们的国民经济，为长期的和平建设准备条件。
    时代所给予我们的是双重的斗争任务，一方面是被迫与帝国主义进行尖锐的斗争，另一方面是继续进行国民经济的恢复。这两者之间，不是矛盾的，而是统一的；并且我们有足够的条件和充分的信心，胜利地完成这双重任务。
    虽然我们被迫与帝国主义进行尖锐的斗争，需要耗费我们一部分人力和物力，然而这是巩固胜利消灭后患所必须支付的代价，这一代价在此刻支付，要比将来支付少得多。假如我们对帝国主义的侵略逐步忍让，坐视帝国主义宰割我们的邻邦，侵占我们的台湾，扶植这些地方的反动势力来作为其侵略中国的工具，然后静待帝国主义选择时机给我们大规模厮杀一场，这是我们不希望的，而且是不智的。这样的结果不是和平的胜利而是战争的胜利，会使中国人民及全世界劳动人民遭受更大的牺牲。和平的力量要战胜战争，只有在各方面继续不断的消灭战争的酵母，折断侵略者的矛头，使战争集团的力量不断削弱，和平集团的力量不断增长，这就是和平战胜战争的道路，也就是我们阻止第三次世界大战及早日进入和平建设阶段的道路。
    正是为了要及早进行和平建设，所以此刻对美帝国主义的狂妄的侵略行动要给以无情的打击，我们有没有力量来进行这一斗争和取得胜利的把握呢？有的！我们有四亿七千五百万团结一致的人民，我们有强大的人民解放军，我们有虽不强大但甚巩固的经济基础，最后我们还有千锤百炼的中国共产党的领导和全国人民的团结。这些条件使我们有充分的信心来结合全世界和平民主的力量取得对美帝国主义斗争的胜利，美帝国主义虽然挟有部分物质的优势，然而这决不能保证侵略战争的胜利，胜利最后决定于广大的人民。二次大战说明了这一点，中国革命消灭蒋美八百万的反动部队说明了这一点，最近朝鲜战局的发展也说明了这一点。因此，中国人民的抗美援朝，必然会有助于朝鲜人民的解放和击败美帝国主义侵略者，对和平事业建立伟大的功勋。
    反美帝国主义侵略的斗争，是我全国人民永远摆脱帝国主义压迫取得永久和平的斗争。这一斗争是我们革命进程中必经的过程，这一斗争与我们和平建设事业息息相关的。这一斗争的胜利，正是一切长期建设事业的开始并保证其不再遭受破坏的前提。
    四
    现在我们还不能肯定反美帝侵略的斗争要继续多久和发展至何种范围。因为，扩大战争坚持侵略的权是操之于帝国主义之手的。然而我们可以肯定的是：不论这一斗争演变至何种程度，我们的国民经济仍会在现有的基础之上继续恢复和适当的发展，其原因是：
    第一，占全国生产总值百分之九十的是农业和手工业生产。农业和手工业的发展主要是由于土改以后，农民生产积极性的提高，农民生活的改善和农民生产投资的扩大。随着今冬明春新区一亿三千万以上人口土改的完成，可以保证一九五一年的农业生产情况要较今年更为良好。政府对于必需的农田水利投资将不受时局的影响而继续投放下去，外销的各种农业特产因我们已与苏联及东欧各国缔结了广泛的贸易协定，输出的数量会逐年增加，即使帝国主义对我封锁亦不致受严重影响。
    第二，私人的工商业，本年是在政府的帮助之下，在物价稳定和交通便利的各种有利条件之下，随着农业生产的高涨而恢复繁荣起来的。以上这些有利条件在一九五一年不仅继续存在，而且会更向前发展。对私人工业的加工定货可能较本年更为扩大，由于农村购买力的逐年提高，内地贸易会更趋繁荣。私人资本向内地投放的道路是畅通的，帝国主义者对我作某些物资的封锁，正足以坚定我们的决心，使我国民经济的各部门在独立自给的基础之上加速发展起来。
    第三，领导我们国家工业化的国营工矿企业，一年来已有显著的成就。一般的已能在现有的资金和人力配备之下进行扩大再生产。帝国主义侵略战争的威胁会使我们对某些地域的工矿业停止扩展，但我们会在另一些地区和某些重要的工矿业部门加速扩张。结果会促使工矿交通事业的地域分布上趋向平衡，并使工业的结构加速予以合理的补充和调整。
    第四，国家贸易机构及金融机构对市场的调节与掌握，已具有较好的基础。在公私兼顾的原则之下，掌握重要物资，巩固物价，并进一步的组织市场，组织城乡合作社，使生产、贩运、销售与消费的各个环节一步一步组织起来，使国家贸易在国民经济的恢复过程中发挥更大的调节作用，是完全可能和必要的。市场的合理组织，会保证我们公私贸易能够应付任何情况，并使私人工商业的发展置于更巩固的基础之上。
    第五，全国劳动人民对于生产的积极性，是我国民经济发展的基本动力。一年来劳动阶级在工业、农业、交通等各部门所进行的狂热的生产运动，大大提高了经济的发展速度。这种收获还不是由于进步的科学的生产管理制度，主要的是由于劳动者对劳动态度的转变和对新的政权的热爱。抗美援朝的运动开始以后，东北华北各地的工农劳动者掀起了新的生产高潮，这就是我们不可动摇的力量，这种力量使我们深信在生产方面可以应付任何帝国主义的挑衅，保证我们的国民经济在任何困难情况下都能应付裕如并继续发展下去。
    以上是说明我们虽还不能立即进行长期的和平建设，但我们的国民经济仍能继续恢复和发展的基本情况。把我们这种情况与帝国主义国家危机的深刻化及因备战而造成的混乱状态相较，清楚地说明了我们新民主主义经济制度的优越性。帝国主义高度的工业集中及尖锐的阶级矛盾和宗主国与殖民地之间矛盾的发展，可能使他们在一次大规模的战争中迅速崩塌下去，这也正是帝国主义者在侵略战争中的忐忑。然而只要他们一步一步扩大战争，这一命运是必然地等待着他们的。
