During my stay in Berlin, from government offices to factories, everyone was discussing the completion of the two-year plan before the Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party, and the commencement of the new five-year plan. To understand the content and achievements of the two-year plan, I visited Comrade Heinrich Rau, the Economic Planning Minister of the German Democratic Republic. The following is our conversation:

Q: How was the two-year plan formulated?

A: The 1949-1950 two-year plan was drafted by Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht and decided upon by the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Unity Party.

The Socialist Unity Party submitted this plan as a proposal to the German Economic Commission, the highest legislative body of the German Democratic Republic at the time. After discussion, the plan was adopted.

The two-year plan is a plan for carrying out economic recovery work based on our own strength. The foundation of the two-year plan lies in the trust placed in the activities of the working people in our cities and countryside. It is a precise battle plan to strive for national independence and autonomy, to oppose the Marshall Plan, and to prevent the German people from becoming colonial slaves of American monopoly capitalists.

The two-year plan is based on construction work that relies on the strength of our own people. Only on the basis of an anti-fascist, democratic system, on a strong state-owned enterprise sector (referred to as "People's Enterprises" in the German Democratic Republic and Soviet-operated factories with equal status, as well as nationalized finance and transportation), and in close cooperation with socialist Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, could the two-year plan be implemented. Reactionary forces oppose these principles of the two-year plan; they attempt to push our people onto the path of the Marshall Plan and preparations for war against the Soviet Union. These are the very people who are waging a "cold war" against our German Democratic Republic.

Based on the 1947 production volume, the two-year plan stipulated that by the end of 1950, industrial production should be increased by 35 percent, reaching 81 percent of the 1936 level. To achieve this goal, labor productivity should be increased by 30 percent compared to 1947, the total wage bill should be increased by 15 percent, and production costs should be reduced by 7 percent. However, spurred by the production competition movement initiated by Adolf Hennecke (a Stakhanovite worker in the German Democratic Republic), the level of industrial production achieved in the last quarter of 1948 forced the German Economic Commission to revise its prepared 1949 national economic plan, setting a higher target. The Economic Commission took the 1948 production level as the starting point for the two-year plan, therefore, the two-year plan aimed to reach not 81 percent, but 95 percent of the 1936 level.

Even the thus-defined production targets proved to be too conservative. It was originally planned that industrial production in 1949 should increase by 16 percent compared to 1948, but in reality, due to the increase in labor productivity, industrial production in 1949 was 21 percent higher than in 1948. Therefore, we increased the targets of the 1950 national economic plan, on average, to 103.1 percent of the 1936 industrial production.

The production achievements of the first quarter of 1950 exceeded this plan by 3 percent.

Q: In the two-year plan striving to restore and develop the peaceful economy of the German Democratic Republic, what is the central link?

A: In order to establish an independent German peaceful economy and create a foundation for the accelerated development of all industrial, transportation, and agricultural production, we must first take care to develop the key raw material industries and machine industries. Therefore, the important links in completing the two-year plan are the mining of coal and coal mines, the mining of potash and non-ferrous minerals, electricity, the basic chemical industry, steelmaking and machine industries, electrical engineering, and the instrument and optical industry. The first priority is the production of pig iron and steel, because in the German Democratic Republic region, almost all pig iron and steel supplies have always relied on the Ruhr region, which is currently controlled by Western imperialists. The fact that Western imperialists and their German agents are implementing a blockade against us, attempting to undermine our economy, gives the task of the two-year plan special importance. Thanks to the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, the transitional period of short supply needed to develop our steelmaking industry has been compensated for. The steel and pig iron we need have been supplied by the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries.

The two-year plan stipulated the rapid restoration and transformation of heavy industry. The vast majority of these industries have already been taken into the hands of the people (i.e., nationalized), which has facilitated the restoration and transformation work. In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, these industries were confiscated from the Nazis and other war criminals, including: fourteen metallurgical plants of the Flick concern, eleven enterprises of the Siemens concern, seventeen enterprises of the GÃ¶ring concern, and nine enterprises of the Mannesmann concern.

These industries, which used to belong to the gang of monopoly capitalists who helped Hitler come to power, have now become tools for peaceful construction. In stark contrast to West Germany, there are no longer any monopoly capitalist enterprises in the German Democratic Republic. The problems of unemployment and economic crisis no longer exist for us. The nationalization of the basic means of production, and the economic plans formulated based on this, guarantee the continuous upward development of our public economy, laying a solid foundation for our peaceful policy and friendly cooperation with all peace-loving countries.

Q: What is the relationship between the state-owned economy and the private economy?

A: In the first year of the two-year plan, that is, during the implementation of the 1949 economic plan, the development of the state-owned sector of our people's economy was much faster than that of private enterprises. The rapid development of the state-owned sector should undoubtedly be attributed to its own planned nature and the improvement of technical level.

In order to develop our economy, the existing forces of private enterprises need to be brought into play. In 1950, the production of private enterprises will continue to increase. Compared with the already greatly increased production volume in 1949, it will increase by another 11 percent in 1950. Even if we do not take the war years into account, this speed of development is unimaginable in the capitalist world. Private enterprises have benefited immensely from our planned economy, because their production can develop substantially, free from any obstacles caused by economic crises in capitalist countries.

The government's public contract bureau provides great help to private enterprises. In contracts signed between private enterprises and state-owned factories and state-owned trading companies, they are not bound by predetermined productivity, but are implemented in accordance with the customs of the free market and competition. Such contracts are valid only after obtaining the approval of the contract bureau with which they are registered.

Q: How is agricultural production planned? In the two-year plan, what is the central link to increasing agricultural production?

A: In terms of agricultural production, we can see the same gratifying upward trend. According to the two-year plan, the cultivated area should be increased to 4,955,700 hectares by 1950, but the current cultivated area has actually reached 5,078,000 hectares. In this way, we have restored the cultivated area of 1938, compensating for the arable land lost in factory construction and road construction since 1938.

The two-year plan also stipulated reaching the pre-war average yield per hectare of cultivated land by 1950. Therefore, we have taken the necessary steps.

By the completion of the two-year plan, the number of our livestock, compared to 1947, should have the following increase:

Horses - increase by 11 percent; Cattle - increase by 25 percent; Pigs - increase by 66 percent; Sheep - increase by 60 percent.

However, according to the figures for achievements at the end of 1949, and the reliable increase in production for 1950 resulting from this, the actual situation of livestock is as follows:

|              | 1947 Headcount | Two-Year Plan Target | 1949 Actual Number | 1950 Target | Increase Rate (Compared to 1947) |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Horses (thousands) | 649.6           | 721                  | 694.1                | 721          | 11%                               |
| Cattle (thousands) | 2,782.6         | 3,478                | 3,310.6              | 3,650        | 21%                               |
| Pigs (thousands)   | 2,073.7         | 3,442                | 4,315.8              | 5,700        | 175%                              |
| Sheep (thousands)  | 685.1           | 1,096                | 898.9                | 1,240        | 81%                               |

Thus, by the end of 1950, the number of cattle and pigs will reach pre-war standards, while sheep and horses will still be somewhat lacking.

The two-year plan is also an encouragement to working farmers. It reflects the strengthening of the economic position and the improvement of living conditions of our working farmers. In order to give fair and reasonable treatment to farmers with different economic capabilities, the amount of payment for all agricultural products (note: refers to farmers selling grain to state-owned grain companies at prices prescribed by the state) is stipulated according to the amount per hectare.

In the rapid development of agricultural production, working farmers need the help of the working class. Here, state-owned farms, which own about one-tenth of the total cultivated area, play a significant role. The task of state-owned farms is to improve higher-quality seeds for the entire agricultural sector and to breed excellent livestock for farmers. In addition, state-owned tractor stations are also increasingly helping working farmers.

State-owned farms and tractor stations have production plans directly given by the state. With their help and the assistance of agricultural associations, the state's agricultural production plan can be implemented into the economy of every farmer.

Q: What are the main experiences in completing the two-year plan?

A: The two-year plan is the economic foundation of the German Democratic Republic's policy. The two-year plan is for upholding peace and restoring the unity of Germany, which is now being divided by the British and American imperialists and their puppet Adenauer. The main aim of the two-year plan is to establish an independent and strong German peaceful economy to ensure the continuous improvement of people's living standards. The formulation and completion of the goals of the two-year plan demonstrate the progressive and democratic forces in the German Democratic Republic region, who are committed to implementing the Potsdam decisions.

The publication of the two-year plan gave our people work goals. From the date of publication, the labor enthusiasm and production efficiency of the people in various economic fields have unexpectedly surged.

A widespread movement of labor heroes began. In this movement, our youth are particularly active. To date, hundreds of thousands of young people have become labor heroes or model workers. The enthusiasm of our youth is also manifested in the peaceful demonstration of 700,000 young people held in Berlin this summer (1950). For us, this is indeed a very important matter.

The completion of the two-year plan is inseparable from the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. Many of our tasks can be completed thanks to their help. In particular, the Soviet Union, after defeating Hitler's Germany, has been helping us rebuild our economy and implement the Potsdam decisions with a supreme and selfless spirit.

Our payment of reparations to the Soviet Union does not affect our construction principles.

The task of the Western imperialist occupiers in West Germany is to eliminate competitors. Therefore, many factories that are able to compete with them have been dismantled. They divided Germany and took possession of the most important industrial area of Germany - the Ruhr; they suppressed all democratic movements and turned West Germany into a base for aggression against democratic countries. The Schuman Plan formulated by the American imperialists intends to completely integrate West Germany's heavy industry and the imperialist war profiteers' arms production. In a word, the Western imperialists have turned West Germany into a colony, requiring it to serve the aggressive policies. Therefore, the Schuman Plan has been supported by the Social Democrats headed by Schumacher.

In the Democratic Republic region, the situation is exactly the opposite. The policy of the Soviet Union and the Soviet occupation authorities is to make Germany an independent, democratic, and peaceful country, a united country. This is fully demonstrated by the great help the Soviet Union has given to our economic construction since 1945. The Soviet Union's reduction of Germany's unpaid reparations by 50 percent and allowing Germany to pay off the debt in fifteen years is entirely to help us rebuild our economy, and our foreign trade will therefore develop greatly.

Q: What comments does the Minister have regarding the current dispatch of a business delegation from the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China?

A: All our internal and external measures are aimed at peaceful coexistence and friendship with all nations. We are excited and encouraged by the victory of the great Chinese people's liberation struggle. The victory of the Chinese people has dealt a decisive blow to those colonial-plundering gentlemen of Britain and the United States. We admire the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong. Today and in the future, we must wholeheartedly establish friendly commercial and political relations with the Chinese people.

I have already said how important the friendly relations and close commercial relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are to us. This friendly cooperative relationship and the establishment of the great People's Republic of China have opened up unlimited prospects for the economic and industrial development of the German Democratic Republic.

A representative of the "Bonn government" recently said: He believes that no one can solve the unemployment problem in West Germany, no one can write a prescription for curing the unemployment problem. Obviously, the policy of helping American imperialism and kowtowing to the masters of the Bonn gentlemen can never get West Germany out of the economic crisis and disaster. The economic crisis in West Germany is becoming increasingly serious. One of the tasks of the Marshall Plan is to export American unemployment to Europe, especially West Germany.

Close friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries is the only way out for the entire German people. With such friendly relations, there will be no one in Germany who is willing to work being unemployed, and the entire German people will have work to do. German-made products that are not needed in this country can find markets in progressive countries. The entire German people undoubtedly hope for this. Therefore, that reactionary policy of supporting American imperialism must be thoroughly eliminated, and the path that Germany should follow is to make Germany an independent, peaceful, and democratic country, and to stand on the side of the world's peaceful and democratic countries.

The great importance of our dispatching a business delegation to the People's Republic of China lies here. This delegation will not only lay the foundation for commercial cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China in the coming years, but also study the possibility of West German industrial products seeking markets in China, and specifically tell the German people: Cooperation with progressive countries will have such broad commercial prospects.

Our business delegation has already taken a portion of the commodity supply lists from West German industrial and commercial circles to China. This once again proves that the economic and political development direction expressed in the two-year plan represents a policy that takes the interests of the entire Germany into consideration.
