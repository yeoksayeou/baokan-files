During my stay in Berlin, from government offices to factories, everyone was discussing the completion of the two-year plan before the Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party, and the commencement of the new five-year plan. To understand the content and achievements of the two-year plan, I visited Comrade Heinrich Rau, the Economic Planning Minister of the German Democratic Republic. The following is our conversation:

Q: How was the two-year plan formulated?

A: The 1949-1950 two-year plan was drafted by Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht and decided upon by the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Unity Party.

The Socialist Unity Party submitted this plan as a proposal to the German Economic Commission, the highest legislative body of the German Democratic Republic at the time. After discussion, the plan was adopted.

The two-year plan is a plan for carrying out economic recovery work based on our own strength. The foundation of the two-year plan lies in the trust placed in the activities of the working people in our cities and countryside. It is a precise battle plan to strive for national independence and autonomy, to oppose the Marshall Plan, and to prevent the German people from becoming colonial slaves of American monopoly capitalists.

The two-year plan is based on construction work that relies on the strength of our own people. Only on the basis of an anti-fascist, democratic system, on a strong state-owned enterprise sector (referred to as "People's Enterprises" in the German Democratic Republic and Soviet-operated factories with equal status, as well as nationalized finance and transportation), and in close cooperation with socialist Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, could the two-year plan be implemented. Reactionary forces oppose these principles of the two-year plan; they attempt to push our people onto the path of the Marshall Plan and preparations for war against the Soviet Union. These are the very people who are waging a "cold war" against our German Democratic Republic.

Based on the 1947 production volume, the two-year plan stipulated that by the end of 1950, industrial production should be increased by 35 percent, reaching 81 percent of the 1936 level. To achieve this goal, labor productivity should be increased by 30 percent compared to 1947, the total wage bill should be increased by 15 percent, and production costs should be reduced by 7 percent. However, spurred by the production competition movement initiated by Adolf Hennecke (a Stakhanovite worker in the German Democratic Republic), the level of industrial production achieved in the last quarter of 1948 forced the German Economic Commission to revise its prepared 1949 national economic plan, setting a higher target. The Economic Commission took the 1948 production level as the starting point for the two-year plan, therefore, the two-year plan aimed to reach not 81 percent, but 95 percent of the 1936 level.

Even the thus-defined production targets proved to be too conservative. It was originally planned that industrial production in 1949 should increase by 16 percent compared to 1948, but in reality, due to the increase in labor productivity, industrial production in 1949 was 21 percent higher than in 1948. Therefore, we increased the targets of the 1950 national economic plan, on average, to 103.1 percent of the 1936 industrial production.

The production achievements of the first quarter of 1950 exceeded this plan by 3 percent.

Q: In the two-year plan striving to restore and develop the peaceful economy of the German Democratic Republic, what is the central link?

A: In order to establish an independent German peaceful economy and create a foundation for the accelerated development of all industrial, transportation, and agricultural production, we must first take care to develop the key raw material industries and machine industries. Therefore, the important links in completing the two-year plan are the mining of coal and coal mines, the mining of potash and non-ferrous minerals, electricity, the basic chemical industry, steelmaking and machine industries, electrical engineering, and the instrument and optical industry. The first priority is the production of pig iron and steel, because in the German Democratic Republic region, almost all pig iron and steel supplies have always relied on the Ruhr region, which is currently controlled by Western imperialists. The fact that Western imperialists and their German agents are implementing a blockade against us, attempting to undermine our economy, gives the task of the two-year plan special importance. Thanks to the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, the transitional period of short supply needed to develop our steelmaking industry has been compensated for. The steel and pig iron we need have been supplied by the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries.

The two-year plan stipulated the rapid restoration and transformation of heavy industry. The vast majority of these industries have already been taken into the hands of the people (i.e., nationalized), which has facilitated the restoration and transformation work. In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, these industries were confiscated from the Nazis and other war criminals, including: fourteen metallurgical plants of the Flick concern, eleven enterprises of the Siemens concern, seventeen enterprises of the Göring concern, and nine enterprises of the Mannesmann concern.

These industries, which used to belong to the gang of monopoly capitalists who helped Hitler come to power, have now become tools for peaceful construction. In stark contrast to West Germany, there are no longer any monopoly capitalist enterprises in the German Democratic Republic. The problems of unemployment and economic crisis no longer exist for us. The nationalization of the basic means of production, and the economic plans formulated based on this, guarantee the continuous upward development of our public economy, laying a solid foundation for our peaceful policy and friendly cooperation with all peace-loving countries.

Q: What is the relationship between the state-owned economy and the private economy?

A: In the first year of the two-year plan, that is, during the implementation of the 1949 economic plan, the development of the state-owned sector of our people's economy was much faster than that of private enterprises. The rapid development of the state-owned sector should undoubtedly be attributed to its own planned nature and the improvement of technical level.

In order to develop our economy, the existing forces of private enterprises need to be brought into play. In 1950, the production of private enterprises will continue to increase. Compared with the already greatly increased production volume in 1949, it will increase by another 11 percent in 1950. Even if we do not take the war years into account, this speed of development is unimaginable in the capitalist world. Private enterprises have benefited immensely from our planned economy, because their production can develop substantially, free from any obstacles caused by economic crises in capitalist countries.

The government's public contract bureau provides great help to private enterprises. In contracts signed between private enterprises and state-owned factories and state-owned trading companies, they are not bound by predetermined productivity, but are implemented in accordance with the customs of the free market and competition. Such contracts are valid only after obtaining the approval of the contract bureau with which they are registered.

Q: How is agricultural production planned? In the two-year plan, what is the central link to increasing agricultural production?

A: In terms of agricultural production, we can see the same gratifying upward trend. According to the two-year plan, the cultivated area should be increased to 4,955,700 hectares by 1950, but the current cultivated area has actually reached 5,078,000 hectares. In this way, we have restored the cultivated area of 1938, compensating for the arable land lost in factory construction and road construction since 1938.

The two-year plan also stipulated reaching the pre-war average yield per hectare of cultivated land by 1950. Therefore, we have taken the necessary steps.

By the completion of the two-year plan, the number of our livestock, compared to 1947, should have the following increase:

Horses - increase by 11 percent; Cattle - increase by 25 percent; Pigs - increase by 66 percent; Sheep - increase by 60 percent.

However, according to the figures for achievements at the end of 1949, and the reliable increase in production for 1950 resulting from this, the actual situation of livestock is as follows:

|              | 1947 Headcount | Two-Year Plan Target | 1949 Actual Number | 1950 Target | Increase Rate (Compared to 1947) |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Horses (thousands) | 649.6           | 721                  | 694.1                | 721          | 11%                               |
| Cattle (thousands) | 2,782.6         | 3,478                | 3,310.6              | 3,650        | 21%                               |
| Pigs (thousands)   | 2,073.7         | 3,442                | 4,315.8              | 5,700        | 175%                              |
| Sheep (thousands)  | 685.1           | 1,096                | 898.9                | 1,240        | 81%                               |

Thus, by the end of 1950, the number of cattle and pigs will reach pre-war standards, while sheep and horses will still be somewhat lacking.

The two-year plan is also an encouragement to working farmers. It reflects the strengthening of the economic position and the improvement of living conditions of our working farmers. In order to give fair and reasonable treatment to farmers with different economic capabilities, the amount of payment for all agricultural products (note: refers to farmers selling grain to state-owned grain companies at prices prescribed by the state) is stipulated according to the amount per hectare.

In the rapid development of agricultural production, working farmers need the help of the working class. Here, state-owned farms, which own about one-tenth of the total cultivated area, play a significant role. The task of state-owned farms is to improve higher-quality seeds for the entire agricultural sector and to breed excellent livestock for farmers. In addition, state-owned tractor stations are also increasingly helping working farmers.

State-owned farms and tractor stations have production plans directly given by the state. With their help and the assistance of agricultural associations, the state's agricultural production plan can be implemented into the economy of every farmer.

Q: What are the main experiences in completing the two-year plan?

A: The two-year plan is the economic foundation of the German Democratic Republic's policy. The two-year plan is for upholding peace and restoring the unity of Germany, which is now being divided by the British and American imperialists and their puppet Adenauer. The main aim of the two-year plan is to establish an independent and strong German peaceful economy to ensure the continuous improvement of people's living standards. The formulation and completion of the goals of the two-year plan demonstrate the progressive and democratic forces in the German Democratic Republic region, who are committed to implementing the Potsdam decisions.

The publication of the two-year plan gave our people work goals. From the date of publication, the labor enthusiasm and production efficiency of the people in various economic fields have unexpectedly surged.

A widespread movement of labor heroes began. In this movement, our youth are particularly active. To date, hundreds of thousands of young people have become labor heroes or model workers. The enthusiasm of our youth is also manifested in the peaceful demonstration of 700,000 young people held in Berlin this summer (1950). For us, this is indeed a very important matter.

The completion of the two-year plan is inseparable from the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. Many of our tasks can be completed thanks to their help. In particular, the Soviet Union, after defeating Hitler's Germany, has been helping us rebuild our economy and implement the Potsdam decisions with a supreme and selfless spirit.

Our payment of reparations to the Soviet Union does not affect our construction principles.

The task of the Western imperialist occupiers in West Germany is to eliminate competitors. Therefore, many factories that are able to compete with them have been dismantled. They divided Germany and took possession of the most important industrial area of Germany - the Ruhr; they suppressed all democratic movements and turned West Germany into a base for aggression against democratic countries. The Schuman Plan formulated by the American imperialists intends to completely integrate West Germany's heavy industry and the imperialist war profiteers' arms production. In a word, the Western imperialists have turned West Germany into a colony, requiring it to serve the aggressive policies. Therefore, the Schuman Plan has been supported by the Social Democrats headed by Schumacher.

In the Democratic Republic region, the situation is exactly the opposite. The policy of the Soviet Union and the Soviet occupation authorities is to make Germany an independent, democratic, and peaceful country, a united country. This is fully demonstrated by the great help the Soviet Union has given to our economic construction since 1945. The Soviet Union's reduction of Germany's unpaid reparations by 50 percent and allowing Germany to pay off the debt in fifteen years is entirely to help us rebuild our economy, and our foreign trade will therefore develop greatly.

Q: What comments does the Minister have regarding the current dispatch of a business delegation from the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China?

A: All our internal and external measures are aimed at peaceful coexistence and friendship with all nations. We are excited and encouraged by the victory of the great Chinese people's liberation struggle. The victory of the Chinese people has dealt a decisive blow to those colonial-plundering gentlemen of Britain and the United States. We admire the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong. Today and in the future, we must wholeheartedly establish friendly commercial and political relations with the Chinese people.

I have already said how important the friendly relations and close commercial relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are to us. This friendly cooperative relationship and the establishment of the great People's Republic of China have opened up unlimited prospects for the economic and industrial development of the German Democratic Republic.

A representative of the "Bonn government" recently said: He believes that no one can solve the unemployment problem in West Germany, no one can write a prescription for curing the unemployment problem. Obviously, the policy of helping American imperialism and kowtowing to the masters of the Bonn gentlemen can never get West Germany out of the economic crisis and disaster. The economic crisis in West Germany is becoming increasingly serious. One of the tasks of the Marshall Plan is to export American unemployment to Europe, especially West Germany.

Close friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries is the only way out for the entire German people. With such friendly relations, there will be no one in Germany who is willing to work being unemployed, and the entire German people will have work to do. German-made products that are not needed in this country can find markets in progressive countries. The entire German people undoubtedly hope for this. Therefore, that reactionary policy of supporting American imperialism must be thoroughly eliminated, and the path that Germany should follow is to make Germany an independent, peaceful, and democratic country, and to stand on the side of the world's peaceful and democratic countries.

The great importance of our dispatching a business delegation to the People's Republic of China lies here. This delegation will not only lay the foundation for commercial cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China in the coming years, but also study the possibility of West German industrial products seeking markets in China, and specifically tell the German people: Cooperation with progressive countries will have such broad commercial prospects.

Our business delegation has already taken a portion of the commodity supply lists from West German industrial and commercial circles to China. This once again proves that the economic and political development direction expressed in the two-year plan represents a policy that takes the interests of the entire Germany into consideration.

    民主德国经济计划部长亨利·劳访问记
    德意志民主共和国访问记之七
    吴文焘
    当我在柏林逗留的期间，从政府机关到工厂，都正在谈论着要在统一社会党第二届代表大会以前完成两年计划，同时开始新的五年计划。为了要了解两年计划的内容和成就，我访问了德意志民主共和国的经济计划部长亨利·劳同志。下面是我们的谈话：
    问：两年计划是怎样制定的？
    答：一九四九——一九五○两年计划是经乌布利希副总理所拟订，而由统一社会党的中央执行委员会所决定的。
    统一社会党把这个计划作为议案提交当时民主德国的最高立法机关——德国经济委员会。经过讨论之后，这个计划被通过了。
    两年计划是靠自己的力量来进行经济恢复工作的一个计划。在对我国城乡劳动人民的活动的信任上奠定了两年计划的基础。它是争取民族的独立、自主，反对马歇尔计划、反对使德国人民沦为美国垄断资本家的殖民地奴隶的精确的战斗计划。
    两年计划以依赖着我国人民自身力量的建设工作为出发点。只有在一个反法西斯的、民主制度的基础上，在一个强固的国有企业部分（在德意志民主共和国被称作“人民的企业”和具有同等地位的苏联经营的工厂，以及国有化的财政与运输事业）的基础上，与社会主义苏联及人民民主国家亲密地合作着，两年计划才有实行的可能。反动势力反对两年计划的这些原则；他们企图把我国人民推到马歇尔计划和准备对苏作战的道路上去。就是这些人正在进行着反对我们德意志民主共和国的“冷战”。
    按照一九四七年的生产量，两年计划规定在一九五○年年底使工业生产提高百分之三十五，即达到一九三六年的百分之八十一。为了达到这个目标，劳动生产率应较一九四七年提高百分之三十，工资总额应增加百分之十五，生产费应降低百分之七。但在阿道夫·韩尼克（民主德国的斯达哈诺夫式工作者）所发动的生产竞赛运动的刺激下，一九四八年最后一季所达到的工业生产水平，却迫使德意志经济委员会修改了它所准备好的一九四九年国家经济计划，订出一个较高的目标。经济委员会把一九四八年生产水平作为两年计划的出发点，因此，两年计划所要达到的不是一九三六年水平的百分之八十一，而是百分之九十五。
    甚至这样规定的生产目标也证明是过于保守的。原定一九四九年的工业生产应较一九四八年提高百分之十六，但实际上，由于劳动生产率的提高，一九四九年工业生产却较一九四八年高出了百分之二十一。因此，我们把一九五○年国家经济计划的目标，平均提高到一九三六年工业生产的百分之一○三点一。
    一九五○年第一季的生产成绩较这个计划还高出了百分之三。
    问：在力求恢复与发展德意志民主共和国和平经济的两年计划中间，中心的环节是什么呢？
    答：为了建立独立的德国和平经济，并为全部工业、运输和农业生产创造加速发展的基础，我们首先必须照顾到发展关键的原料工业和机器工业。因此，完成两年计划的重要环节是煤和煤矿的开采，加里和非铁矿物的开采，电力，基本化学工业，炼钢和机器工业，电气工程，仪器和光学工业。第一个要务就是生产生铁和钢，因为在德意志民主共和国区域内，差不多全部生铁和钢的供给，一向是仰赖于目前西方帝国主义者所掌握的鲁尔区的。西方帝国主义者及其德国的代理人们对我们实行封锁，企图破坏我们的经济，这一事实使两年计划的任务有了特殊的重要性。由于苏联和新民主主义国家的友谊援助，发展我们的炼钢工业所需要的，青黄不接的过渡时间，是得到弥补了。我们所需要的钢和生铁，都从苏联和新民主主义国家得到了供给。
    两年计划中规订了重工业的迅速恢复与改造。这些工业的绝大部分已经掌握在人民的手里（即国有），恢复与改造的工作因而得到了便利。按照波茨坦协定，这些工业从纳粹和其他战犯手中收归公有，其中有：弗利科康采恩的十四个炼冶厂、西门子康采恩的十一个企业、格林康采恩的十七个企业、曼尼斯曼康采恩的九个企业。
    这些工业过去都属于曾经扶助希特勒上台的那帮垄断资本家，现在，已经成为和平建设的工具。和西德恰恰相反，德意志民主共和国里已经没有垄断资本家的企业了。对于我们，失业和经济危机的问题不再存在。基本生产手段的收归公有，以及据此而制订的经济计划，保证了我们公共经济不断的向上发展，给我们的和平政策及与一切爱好和平国家的友好合作打下了巩固的基础。
    问：国有经济与私人经济的关系如何？
    答：在两年计划的头一年里，就是说，在执行一九四九年的经济计划当中，我们人民经济中公营部分的发展，远较私有企业为快。公营部分的迅速发展，不消说，应当归因于本身的计划性和技术水平的提高。
    为了我们经济的发展，私营企业的现存力量是需要发挥的。在一九五○年，私营企业的生产将不断增加。较之早已大大增加的一九四九年生产量，一九五○年还要增加百分之十一。即使我们不把战争年月估计在内，这种发展的速度，也是资本主义世界所不可想像的。私营企业从我们的计划经济中得到了无限的利益，因为它们的生产能够大量发展，已不受资本主义国家中经济危机所造成的那样的任何阻障。
    政府的公共合同局给予私营企业以极大的帮助。私营企业在与国营工厂和国营贸易公司所订立的合同中，不受既定生产率的束缚，而是按照自由市场和竞争的习惯实行的。此种合同，只须获得其所登记的合同局的批准，即为有效。
    问：农业生产计划是怎样进行的？在两年计划中，增加农业生产的中心环节是什么？
    答：在农业生产方面，我们可以看到同样可喜的向上发展的趋势。按照两年计划，耕种面积到一九五○年应增加到四、九五五、七○○公顷，但目前的耕种面积实际已达到五、○七八、○○○公顷。这样，我们已经恢复了一九三八年的耕种面积，弥补了一九三八年以来在建厂筑路方面所损失的耕地。
    两年计划同时规订着在一九五○年达到战前每公顷耕地的平均收获量。因此，我们采取了必要的步骤。
    到两年计划完成时，我们的牲畜的头数，与一九四七年相较，应有如下的增加：
    马——增加百分之十一；牛——增加百分之二十五；猪——增加百分之六十六；羊——增加百分之六十。
    但是，根据一九四九年年底成就的数字，以及由此而产生的一九五○年有把握的增产额，牲畜的实际情况如下：
   一九四七年头数   两年计划     一九四九       一九五○    增加率
   （单位为一千头） 目标         年实数         年目标  （与一九四七年较）马 六四九·六       七二一       六九四·一     七二一       十一％牛 二、七八二·六   三、四七八   三、三一○·六 三、六五○   二一％猪 二、○七三·七   三、四四二   四、三一五·八 五、七○○   一七五％羊 六八五·一       一、○九六   八九八·九     一、二四○   八一％
    这样，到一九五○年底，牛和猪的头数将达到战前的标准，羊和马还是要差一些。
    两年计划对于劳动农民也是一种鼓舞。它反映了我国劳动农民的经济地位的加强和生活条件的改进。为了使不同经济能力的农民得到公平合理的待遇，一切农业生产品的缴纳数额（按：指农民按国家规定价格将粮食出卖给国营粮食公司）均按每公顷多少而有所规定。
    在农业生产的迅速发展当中，劳动农民需要工人阶级的帮助。在这里，拥有总耕种面积约十分之一的国营农场首先起着很大的作用。国营农场的任务，在于为整个农业改良高等的种籽并为农户繁殖优良的牲畜。此外，国营拖拉机站对于劳动农民的帮助，也与日俱增。
    国营农场和拖拉机站，都有国家所直接给予的生产计划。在它们的帮助和农会的协助下，国家的农业生产计划可以贯彻到每一个农户的经济中去。
    问：在完成两年计划中，主要的经验是什么呢？
    答：两年计划是德意志民主共和国政策的经济基础。两年计划为的是坚持和平并恢复德国的统一，现在英美帝国主义者及其傀儡阿登纳正在分裂德国。两年计划的主旨在于建立独立、强盛的德国和平经济，以保证人民生活水平的不断提高。两年计划的目标的制订和完成，显示了德意志民主共和国区域内，以实现波茨坦决议为己任的进步、民主势力。
    两年计划的公布使我国人民有了工作的目标。从公布之日起，在各个经济领域内，人民大众的劳动热情和生产效率，都有着意想不到的高涨。
    一个广泛的劳动英雄运动开始了。在这个运动里，我国青年特别活跃。到现在，已经有几十万青年成了劳动英雄或模范工作者。我国青年的积极性，还表现于今年（一九五○年）夏季在柏林举行的七十万青年的和平示威。对于我们来说，这的确是一件很重要的事。
    两年计划的完成，是与苏联和新民主主义国家的友谊帮助分不开的。我们的许多任务能够完成，都要归因于它们的帮助。特别是苏联，在击败了希特勒德国之后，就以一种至高无上、大公无私的精神帮助我们经济的重建并实现波茨坦决定。
    我们偿付给苏联的赔款，是并不影响我们的建设原则的。
    西方帝国主义占领者在西德的任务，就是消灭竞争者。因此足以和他们竞争的很多工厂，都被拆毁了。他们分裂了德国，把德国最重要的工业区——鲁尔——据为己有；他们镇压一切民主运动，把西德变成侵略民主国家的基地。美帝国主义者所制订的舒曼计划，打算把西德的重工业和帝国主义战争贩子的军火生产完全结合起来。一句话，西方帝国主义者把西德变成了殖民地，要它为侵略政策服务。因此舒曼计划得到了以舒马赫为首的社会民主党的拥护。
    在民主共和国的区域内，情况恰恰相反。苏联和苏占领当局的政策，是在使德国成为一个独立、民主与和平的国家，成为一个统一的国家。这充分地表现于一九四五年以来苏联对我国经济建设上的伟大帮助。苏联将德国应付未付的赔偿费减低百分之五十、并让德国分十五年还清的义举，完全是为了帮助我们经济的重建，我们的对外贸易，也将因此而大大发展。
    问：关于目前德意志民主共和国政府派遣商务代表团去中华人民共和国一事，部长有何评论？
    答：我们对内对外的一切措施，在于和所有民族友好与和平共处。我们因伟大中国人民解放斗争的胜利而感到兴奋鼓舞。中国人民的胜利使英、美那些掠夺殖民地的先生们遭受了决定性的打击。我们景仰中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东。今天和将来，我们一定要全心全意和中国人民建立友谊的商务和政治关系。
    我已经说过和苏联及人民民主国家的友好关系与密切的商务关系对于我们是如何的重要。此种友好合作关系与伟大的中华人民共和国的建立，为德意志民主共和国的经济和工业生产的发展开辟了无限的远景。
    “波恩政府”的一个代表最近说：他认为没人能够解决西德的失业问题，没人能够开一张医治失业问题的药方。很明显的，波恩的先生们那种帮助美帝国主义、向主子们叩头的政策，绝不能使西德摆脱经济危机与灾难。西德的经济危机日益严重地表现出来。马歇尔计划的任务之一，就是把美国的失业输出到欧洲，特别是西德。
    与苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的密切的友好关系，是全德国人民唯一的出路。有了这样的友好关系，在德国就不会有一个愿意工作的人失业，全德国的人民都会有工可做。凡不为本国所需要的德国制造品，都可以在进步的国家里找到市场。全德国人民无疑地是希望这样的。因此，那一种反动的支持美帝国主义的政策，必须彻底加以清除，德国所应遵循的道路，就是使德国成为独立、和平与民主的国家，并站在世界和平民主国家的一方面。
    我们派遣商务代表团到中华人民共和国去的巨大重要性，就在这里。这个代表团不仅要奠立今后数年内德意志民主共和国与中华人民共和国之间的商业合作，同时，还要研究西德工业品在中国寻求市场的可能性，并具体地告诉德国人民：与进步国家的合作，将有怎样广阔的商业前途。
    我们的商务代表团已把西德工商业界的一部分商品供应单带到中国去。这再一次证明：两年计划所表现的经济和政治的发展方向，代表着为整个德国利益着想的政策。
