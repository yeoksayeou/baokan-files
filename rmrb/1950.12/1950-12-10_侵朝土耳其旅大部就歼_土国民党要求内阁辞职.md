Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: After the Turkish brigade, acting as an accomplice in the American aggression against Korea, was almost entirely annihilated, Turkish public opinion was in an uproar. According to a Teletype Agency report citing Istanbul newspapers, the leader of the Turkish National Party, Bayar, attacked the Turkish reactionary government's policy of being an accomplice in the American war of aggression against Korea in parliament. He said, "The Cabinet's dispatch of troops to Korea is unconstitutional and a wrong path." Bayar, in the name of the National Party, the government's opposition party, demanded the Cabinet's resignation.

Angora radio commentator Sheriff has had to admit: "About 40 percent of the brigade's total personnel have died in battle in Korea."

The Turkish brigade, acting as an accomplice of the American aggressors, suffered such heavy losses this time because the US military command in Korea used Turkish soldiers as cannon fodder, ordering them to cover the retreat of the main US forces.

    侵朝土耳其旅大部就歼
    土国民党要求内阁辞职
    【新华社九日讯】为美国侵略朝鲜作帮凶的土耳其旅几全部被歼后，土耳其舆论哗然。据电通社引伊斯坦布尔报纸消息：土耳其国民党领袖贝奥尔在议会中攻击土耳其反动政府参加美国侵朝战争的帮凶政策。他说：“内阁派遣军队到朝鲜是违反宪法的，而且是走错了路。”贝奥尔以政府反对党国民党的名义要求内阁辞职。
    安哥拉广播评论员舍里夫已不得不承认：“该旅全部兵员中，约有百分之四十已在朝鲜阵亡。”
    为美国侵略者帮凶的土耳其旅此次损失所以如此惨重，是由于侵朝美军统帅部利用土耳其士兵当炮灰，命令他们掩护美军主力退却。
