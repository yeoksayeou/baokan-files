Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 29th. According to TASS, Berlin, 27th: The Presidium of the Berlin Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany recently sent a letter to the commanders of the three Western sectors of Berlin, the representative of the Soviet Control Commission in Berlin, Mayor Albert of Greater Berlin, and Berlin West Sector Administrative Head Reuter, opposing the unilateral decision by the Berlin West Sector authorities to hold separate elections on December 3, which further divides Berlin. The letter put forward suggestions for unifying Berlin. The letter pointed out: The division of Berlin into different sectors and the fragmentation of the municipal administrative organs have already had extremely adverse effects on Berlin's economy and culture, causing many enterprises in the Western sector to shut down, and hundreds of thousands of people in the Western sector to become unemployed and live in misery. For the benefit of the people of Berlin, the Berlin Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany hereby suggests: (1) To hold free and democratic elections throughout Berlin in March 1951. (2) To establish a joint committee of the Berlin East and West Sector municipal governments to prepare for the elections. (3) All occupying forces should withdraw from Berlin, and the borders between the sectors should be abolished in accordance with the will of the majority of the people of Berlin.

The letter also stated: After the establishment of a single Berlin administrative organ, the organ should implement the following tasks: Eliminate unemployment in the Western sector of Berlin within three months. Shift all light and heavy industrial enterprises to peaceful production. Reduce prices, oppose re-militarization in every way, and assist the large-scale development of the peace movement in the Western sector of Berlin.

    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：民主德国全国阵线柏林委员会主席团，顷为柏林西区当局片面决定于十二月三日举行单独选举一事致函柏林西部三管区司令、苏联管制委员会驻柏林代表、大柏林市长艾柏特及柏林西区行政首长鲁特尔，反对这种进一步分裂柏林的行动，并提出统一柏林的建议。该函指出：由于柏林的分成各管区以及市行政机关的分裂，已经使柏林的经济与文化受到极端不利的影响，并且造成了西区许多企业停工，西区几十万人失业和生活困苦不堪的情形。民主德国全国阵线柏林委员会为了柏林人民的利益，兹特建议：（一）定于一九五一年三月在柏林全市举行自由的民主选举。（二）成立柏林东区和西区市政府联合委员会来筹备选举。（三）一切占领军撤出柏林，并应依照大多数柏林人民的意志，废除各管区之间的疆界。
    该函并称：在成立单一的柏林行政机关以后，该机关应贯彻下列任务：在三个月内消除柏林西区的失业现象。一切轻重工业企业，转向和平生产。削减物价，以一切方式反对重新军国主义化，并协助柏林西区和平运动的大规模发展。
