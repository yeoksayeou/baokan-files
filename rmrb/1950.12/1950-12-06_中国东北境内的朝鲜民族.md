    The Korean Nationality within Northeast China
    The Beginning of Korean Immigration to the Northeast
    In these days when American imperialists are igniting the flames of war in Korea, our people have been intently watching and closely caring for this neighboring country, separated from our motherland by only a river, and as close as lips and teeth. Our concern is like brotherly affection; or rather, it is also a concern for ourselves. Geographically, China and Korea share a border of over a thousand li. Every Chinese person remembers deeply that at the beginning of the Japanese bandits' invasion of China after annihilating Korea, they stepped onto our land from this springboard. Historically, China and Korea have had relations for over a thousand years. After the Japanese aggressors destroyed Korea, the Chinese and Korean peoples forged an even closer friendship in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and for freedom and liberation.
    As early as the 1870s, counties along the Tumen River such as Hunchun, Wangqing, Yanji, and Helong saw Korean farmers migrating into Chinese territory due to frequent famines and disasters. After Japan annexed Korea in 1910, it established a Governor-General's office in Korea. Through this institution, in addition to carrying out cruel suppression and plunder of the Korean people, they systematically drove the Korean people across the Tumen and Yalu Rivers into Chinese territory batch by batch. This conspiracy of the Japanese imperialists to "colonize Korea with Japanese people, and colonize Manchuria with Korean people" in order to "conquer the continent," coupled with the Korean people's unbearable pain of national subjugation and their demand to seek a way out, and the suitability of the vast fertile land of our Northeast for farming, constituted the conditions for more than a million Korean people to immigrate to the Northeast over the course of thirty-odd years.
            The Number of Korean People in Northeast China
    The question of exactly how many Koreans there are in the Northeast has not had a more accurate answer during the period of Nationalist Party rule, nor was it clearly understood during the days of the Japanese imperialists' occupation of the Northeast. Whether it was the official statistics of the Japanese puppet regime, or the figures published in various yearbooks and publications, they were often inconsistent from year to year, and there were even large discrepancies or contradictions. Now, the existing materials have been compared and studied, and the more reliable "approximate" figures are selected and listed below for reference:

    Appendix Notes:
    1.  The statistical numbers generally do not include the Kwantung Leased Territory (Dalian and Lushun).
    2.  About 110,000 Korean workers in gold mines, iron mines, fisheries, etc., in the far eastern part of northern Manchuria near the Soviet border are not included ("Manchuria Yearbook").
    3.  In addition, about 403,000 Koreans scattered in "Austria" (i.e., remote areas) are not included. ("Manchuria Yearbook").

    According to the incomplete statistics in the table above, it can be roughly seen the approximate number of Korean people in the Northeast over the years, and the development of Korean immigration to the Northeast in the 1930s and 1940s. The table shows that since the beginning of the 20th century, the Korean population in the Northeast has been increasing rapidly. If these statistics are not significantly in error, then the increase from 1908 to 1928 was more than 166,000 people. The increase from 1928 to 1938 also reached a figure quite similar to the increase in the previous 20 years. And in the five years from 1938 to 1943, the increase was more than 358,000 people. That is to say, under the highly expanded Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese bandits increasingly intensified their drive of the Korean people into China in order to facilitate their exploitation and produce more grain for "war support."
    According to the 1943 figures in the table, plus the figures not included in the Dalian and Lushun area, the miners and fishermen in northern Manchuria, and the omissions of those scattered in "Austria" (i.e., remote areas), it is estimated that before Japan's surrender, the total Korean population in the Northeast was around two million. However, after Japan's surrender, hundreds of thousands of people returned to their homeland one after another, leaving behind about 1.2 million people, 90 percent of whom became farmers fixed to the land of the Northeast.
            The Distribution of Korean Immigrants in the Northeast
    Since the vast majority of Korean immigrants in the Northeast were "pioneering farmers," and most of them were systematically transplanted by the Japanese imperialists, their distribution area is very wide, including the six provinces of Jilin, Songjiang, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Heilongjiang, and Rehe; more than 20 cities such as Shenyang and Changchun; the Dalian and Lushun area; and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region all have more or less Korean immigrants. Their distribution density varies greatly depending on the distance of each region from the Korean homeland, the timing of the "pioneering period," and the natural conditions and land situation. The distribution figures for each province and region are listed as follows:

    Appendix Notes:
    1.  The 1938 figures are missing 30,606 people from the old South Manchuria Railway area.
    2.  The original statistical area divisions of the Japanese puppet regime are not uniform. Now, they are calculated separately according to our current provincial areas for easy comparison.
    3.  General materials are missing local statistical figures, so only the figures for the above three years are listed.
    4.  There are hundreds of thousands of figures not statistically accounted for in the areas.

    If we draw some radial lines westward and northward from the Yalu River and the Tumen River on the entire map of the Northeast, we will form a rough map of the distribution of the Korean population in the Northeast. That is, the eastern parts of Jilin and Liaodong provinces, and the southern part of Songjiang province are the most densely populated areas. The area west and north of the Shenyang-Changchun-Harbin line is very sparsely populated. The eastern part of Jilin province, the five counties along the Tumen River of Yanji, Helong, Wangqing, Hunchun, and Antu (established as Jiandao Province during the Manchukuo period), is the area where Koreans first immigrated, and it is also the area where Koreans are most densely distributed. According to 1943 statistics, this area had more than 617,000 Koreans, accounting for more than three-quarters of the total population of the region, and nearly one-third of the total Korean population in the Northeast. Secondly, Shenyang and its vicinity have more than 127,000 people, Mudanjiang and Yanshou areas in Songjiang province have more than 119,000 people, Tonghua and Ji'an areas have more than 93,000 people, and Andong and Kuandian areas have more than 66,000 people. The areas other than the above are more dispersed. Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia have only about 10,000 people each, and Rehe has only more than 1,000 people. Among all the Koreans in the Northeast, except for the 6,000 to 40,000 workers, technicians, and some Koreans engaged in other professions concentrated in cities with developed light and heavy industries such as Shenyang, Changchun, Mudanjiang, Andong, Anshan, and Fushun, more than 95% are farmers.
    After the liberation of the Northeast, although the people's government does not yet have more accurate statistics and distribution of the Korean population, according to the summarized figures reported by Zhu Dehai, a representative of the Korean People's Political Consultative Conference: there are about 647,000 in the Yanbian area of Jilin province, about 196,000 in Songjiang province, about 155,000 in Liaodong province, about 12,000 in Liaoxi province, about 23,000 in Heilongjiang province, and about 1.2 million in total including other places.
            Have Been Fighting Heroically and Unyieldingly All Along
    In order to shatter the shackles of slavery around their necks, and to resist a new shackle of slavery being put around their necks again, the Korean people have been fighting heroically and unyieldingly from the days when they were destroyed by the Japanese bandits to today when they are resisting American imperialist aggression. In the 35 years that Japanese imperialists ruled Korea, regardless of how bloody and cruel the suppression was, the revolutionary actions of the Korean people followed one another and never stopped. After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, the guerrilla armed forces of the Chinese and Korean people grew like spring grass in various parts of the Northeast. The anti-Japanese teams formed by the old army or heroes of the green forest for a period of time are not mentioned here. Only in the anti-Japanese guerrillas developed by the Communist Party of China from Panshi, Bayan, Raohe, Zhuhe, Ning'an, Tangyuan, Hailun, Mishan, and southeastern Manchuria, there were tens of thousands of Korean workers, farmers, and intellectuals. The Panshi Guerrilla was established on the basis of Chinese and Korean workers and peasants under the leadership of Yang Jingyu and Li Hongguang (Korean), the leaders of the anti-Japanese struggle of the Chinese and Korean people and glorious members of the Communist Party of China. In the area on the right bank of the Ussuri River in the lower reaches of the Songhua River, there was the Raohe Guerrilla led by Cui Shiquan (Korean) and Li Xuefu. To the east of Harbin, there was the Zhuhe Guerrilla led by Zhao Shangzhi and Li Qidong (Korean), which were all armed forces jointly formed by the Chinese and Korean people. In addition, there were more than 5,000 Korean Independence Revolutionary Army composed entirely of Korean people, active along the Yalu River; and 3,000 Korean People's Revolutionary Army fighting the enemy in the "Jiandao" area.
    In January 1936, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was officially formed. Its main leaders were Yang Jingyu, Zhao Shangzhi, Li Hongguang, Kim Il-sung and other anti-Japanese heroes of the Chinese and Korean people. As the backbone force of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, the First, Second, and Third Armies were all jointly composed of Chinese and Korean people, and developed and grew in the areas where the Korean nationality lived. For example, the predecessor of the First Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army was the Panshi Guerrilla, the predecessor of the Second Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army was the joint anti-Japanese guerrilla force of the Chinese and Korean people who galloped in southeastern Manchuria, and the predecessor of the Third Army of the Anti-Japanese United Army was the Zhuhe Guerrilla which grew and developed in the Yanshou and Zhuhe (now Shangzhi County) areas. Almost half of the soldiers in the above three armies were Korean comrades. In addition, the Fifth Army developed from the Ning'an Guerrilla, the Sixth Army developed from the Tangyuan Guerrilla, and the Seventh Army developed from the Raohe Guerrilla also had a considerable number of Korean comrades. In total, during the entire Anti-Japanese War, tens of thousands of Korean people participated in this arduous and heroic cause. Tens of thousands of Korean martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese and Korean national liberation war. This sacrifice has a price. They gave countless powerful blows to the Japanese imperialists, and left behind many moving stories to educate the people, and wrote a brilliant page in the history of the great people's liberation struggle. "War educated the people, and the people will win the war." In the years of fighting side by side, the Chinese and Korean people increased their infinite confidence in victory, tempered the strength to meet victory, and prepared the necessary conditions for victory. The day of victory finally came. In August 1945, the anti-Japanese armed forces of the Chinese and Korean people in the Northeast cooperated with the Soviet Red Army to liberate the Northeast and Korea from the Japanese bandits, traitors, and feudal landlords. The Chinese and Korean people won the great, but preliminary, revolutionary fruits.
            Enthusiastically Participated in the Liberation War
    After Japan's surrender, hundreds of thousands of Korean people in the Northeast returned to their homeland. There are still more than one million people left, and they have become accustomed to living in the environment in which they now live, where there is land that they have personally cultivated, houses that they have built with their own hands, and neighbors who are as close as brothers. Under the land policy of the people's government, with the land reform in the Northeast, they received land in the same way as the Chinese people and began the happy life that their grandparents had dreamed of. At this time, the American imperialist ships and planes transported the American-equipped American imperialist running dogs—the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army—to the Northeast, and desperately tried to seize the fruits of victory that the Chinese and Korean people had exchanged with their blood and sweat. This forced the Chinese and Korean people to take up their weapons again to defend themselves.
    In the three-year liberation war, more than 50,000 Korean people voluntarily joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which liberated all the way from the Northeast to Hainan Island, tens of thousands of new and old Korean comrades bravely and responsibly stood on various positions. From commanders to soldiers, from gunners to tank soldiers, from driving trucks to digging mines, from doctors to nurses, countless heroes and models emerged from many important and arduous positions, and from many heroic and decisive battles. What we should especially remember deeply is that countless Korean brothers shed their last drop of blood to defeat our common enemy. In the rear, millions of Korean people enthusiastically produced to support the front, guaranteeing the victory of the Chinese revolution.
            Became a Member of the Big Family of All Nationalities in Our Country
    They have the full right to enjoy the fruits they have exchanged with their own blood and sweat. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the correct implementation of the people's government's national policy, the 1.2 million Korean people living in the Northeast have transformed from the "pioneering farmers" and guest status of overseas Chinese to a member of the masters of their land. They participate equally with the people of other nationalities in this big family in various political, economic, cultural and other construction work after liberation. With the progress of the liberation war, local governments of their own were established in various areas where the Korean people lived. In areas where the Korean and Han people lived together, the Korean people also participated in local government work according to the proportion of the population. In September 1949, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference opened, and the Korean people in Northeast China sent representatives to participate in the conference with the qualifications of ethnic minorities within China. For the first time in history, they met with their brother nationalities as a member of the Chinese nation. Since then, this new component among the people of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China has been separated from the Korean people residing in China in the minds of the people of all brother nationalities.
    Many people's representative conferences in various places in the Northeast have representatives of the Korean nationality participating. For example, the people's representative conferences of Shenyang, Jilin, Changchun, Gongzhuling and other cities have one or two Korean national representatives participating. Among the 220 representatives of Yongji County, five Korean national representatives attended as ethnic minorities. The Korean national representatives in the quotas of other representatives (such as farmers) are not included.
    There are Korean national committee members in the National Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government and the Northeast People's Government. In the areas where the Korean nationality lives in the five counties of Yanbian in Jilin Province, the working cadres are all Koreans. There are three Korean people's gathering areas in Songjiang Province, and 214 Korean-Han mixed areas, including a total of 141 administrative villages and 265 natural villages. The cadres of the district and village governments are entirely Korean. In the mixed areas of Korean and Han people, representatives elected according to the proportion of the ethnic population also participate in the work of the local government. As of the first half of 1950, there were more than 900 Korean ethnic groups and cadres in the entire Northeast, 27 county-level cadres, and 1 commissioner. More than 6,200 various working cadres were trained and cultivated from various training classes and schools, and they have all taken up various working positions one after another.
            The Economic Life of the Korean Nationality
    The Korean nationality is a resolute and brave nationality, and it is also a simple and hard-working nationality. The Korean people in the Northeast reclaimed vast lands and turned many dry lands into paddy fields. During the rule of the Japanese puppet regime, except for a very few farmers who cultivated their own land, more than 90% were farmers without land. Therefore, at that time, there was a saying: "Han landlords, Korean tenants." They rented land directly or indirectly from landlords from economic encroachment institutions such as the South Manchuria Railway Colonization Company and the Manchuria-Korea Colonization Company, and were doubly exploited by Japanese imperialism and feudal landlords. After August 15th, the land reform was fully implemented in the Northeast, and the Korean people, like the Mongolian and Han people, were given land, draught animals, agricultural implements, houses and other means of livelihood. Taking Yanshou County in Songjiang Province as an example: before liberation, there were 2,275 Korean households in the county, cultivating 59,120 mu of land, of which only 4,500 mu of land was their own (accounting for 7.6% of the total cultivated land). After the land reform, there were 1,956 Korean households in the county, divided into 71,570 mu of land, which was more than 15 times more than the original land owned by the Korean people in the county, and the ownership of cultivated land belonged 100% to the farmers themselves.
    There are approximately 936,040 mu of paddy fields in Songjiang Province, of which 58% of the 539,280 mu have been owned by "Korean tenants" after the land reform. They were allocated 13.3 mu of land per household, and each person received an average of more than 2.9 mu of land. In addition to land, the Koreans in the province own a total of 20,000 large and small livestock, more than 9,000 ox and horse carts, and more than 20,000 various agricultural machines, with an average of one draught animal per two households and one cart per four households. In Zhangjiajie Village, Xujia Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, 51 Korean farmers had a surge in production enthusiasm after the land reform, improved agricultural technology, doubled the harvest in three years, turned 170 mu of dry land into paddy fields, built 19 new houses, and dug 17 foreign wells. In the past, the entire village had only 17 cattle and 11 carts. Now, there are 47 cattle and 28 carts.
            Cultural Construction in the Past Three Years
    There is an old Korean proverb that says: "Chinese people leave property to their children, Korean people leave words to their children." However, under the reactionary rule of the Japanese puppet regime, which implemented enslavement education, the Korean people were not allowed to freely learn and use their own national language and writing. Koreans were required to use Japanese as the national language, and Japanese textbooks were used in schools. They did not have, and were not allowed to have, their own schools. After liberation, under the leadership and assistance of the people's government, there has been rapid development in cultural education, and a large number of teachers have been trained and transformed, and schools have been added. In the Yanbian Korean nationality gathering area, 357 schools have been established, including 1 university, 25 middle schools, and 331 primary schools. There is an average of one primary school in each village and five middle schools in each county, with a total of more than 114,000 students. There are 10 Korean middle schools and 371 primary schools in Songjiang Province. There is now one Korean nationality university in the entire Northeast. There are 4 normal schools, more than 70 middle schools, and more than 1,500 primary schools. In total, there are more than 200,000 university, middle and primary school students. They have restored the use of the Korean language and writing, and Korean textbooks are used in schools. Because the places where Chinese characters were originally borrowed in Korean have been eliminated, and generally Pinyin Korean is used, a large number of illiterates have been eliminated. Their own Korean newspapers—the Northeast Korean People's Daily and the Worker-Peasant Daily—have a total circulation of 45,000 copies, and they also have their own cultural publishing house. In the past three years, they have published more than 10,000 kinds of textbooks, reference books, worker-peasant readings, and magazines, with more than 440,000 copies.
            They Have the Right to Defend Their Motherland
    History tells us that the day when Japanese imperialism completely enslaved the Korean people was the day when they completely invaded China. History also tells us that the unity of the Chinese and Korean people has enough power to defeat the invaders. The Korean nationality in the Northeast, as one of the constituent nationalities of the People's Republic of China, was naturally formed during the arduous and arduous 30-40 years of revolutionary historical struggle against aggression, shedding much blood, sacrificing many lives, working hard to produce, and working hard to support the front, winning the Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War. They have the right to live on the land they have cultivated, the right to participate in the people's government and the people's army, and the right to participate in and enjoy political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings. We people of other nationalities welcome this new brother nationality with infinite enthusiasm to build our country with us. Today, when the American imperialists' lackeys are stepping on the bridge on the opposite side of the Yalu River, which was once used by Japanese imperialism as a "bridge to conquer the Asian continent," it is their sacred right for the Korean people residing in the Northeast to be willing to return to defend their motherland. We people of other brother nationalities not only enthusiastically support their just actions, but we also have the responsibility and obligation to stand with our comrades-in-arms who have shared weal and woe with us for the past two or three decades and severely punish the American robbers who are igniting the flames of war at our gate.

    中国东北境内的朝鲜民族
    朝鲜移民到东北的开始
    在美帝国主义者燃起侵朝战火的日子里，我国人民对于这个和自己的祖国只有一江之隔、唇齿相依的邻邦，一直都在全神注视、密切地关怀着。我们的关怀，如兄弟般的感情；或者说也就是关怀着我们自己。地理上中国和朝鲜有着毗连千余里的疆界，每一个中国人都深深地记得：在日寇灭鲜侵华之初，就是从这块跳板走上我们国土的。在历史上中国和朝鲜曾有过千余年的关系。在日本侵略者灭亡朝鲜以后，中朝民族人民在反帝、反封建、争取自由解放的斗争中，结成了更亲密的友谊。
    最早在十九世纪七十年代，沿着图们江的珲春、汪清、延吉、和龙等县，就有了由于频年的饥馑灾荒而移居到中国境内来的朝鲜农民。一九一○年日本并吞了朝鲜以后，在朝鲜设了总督府，通过了这个机构，除了对于朝鲜人民进行残酷的镇压掠夺外，更有计划地把朝鲜人民一批一批地驱赶过图们江和鸭绿江的中国境内来。日本帝国主义者的这种“日人殖鲜，鲜人殖满”以便“征服大陆”的阴谋；加上朝鲜人民不堪亡国惨痛，寻求生路的要求；和我国的东北广大沃土的宜于农垦，就构成三十几年间百余万朝鲜人民移入东北的条件。
            东北朝鲜人口的数字
    朝鲜人在东北到底有多少的问题，不但在国民党统治的时期没有过较正确的答案，即是日本帝国主义者侵占东北的日子里，也没有弄得很清楚。无论日伪官方统计数字，或各种年鉴书刊发表的数字，经常是同年的统计不一样，甚至有很大的距离或矛盾。现在把既有的材料加以对照研究，择其比较有根据的“近似”数字列表于后，以作参考：

    附注：１、各统计数一般未将关东州（旅大）计入。
      ２、北满极东部靠近苏联边境有金矿、铁矿、渔业等朝鲜工人约十
          一万未计在内（“满洲年鉴”）
      ３、另有散居“奥地”（即僻偏地区）之朝鲜人约四○三，○○○
          余人未计入。（“满洲年鉴”）
    根据上表不完全的统计，可以大致看出历年来东北朝鲜人口概数，以及三四十年来东北朝鲜移民的发展概况。表上说明进入二十世纪以来，东北的朝鲜人口一直在飞跃地增加着。如果这些统计数字没有什么大的差错时，那么，从一九○八到一九二八的二十年间，增加了十六万六千余人。从一九二八到一九三八的十年间，也同样达到了和以前二十年中所增加的颇为相近的数字。而一九三八到一九四三的五年间，则增加了三十五万八千余人。也就是说日寇在侵华战争高度扩张下，日益加紧地把朝鲜人民赶到中国境内来，以便于它的榨取和更多地给它生产借以“养战”的粮食。
    照表上的一九四三年数字，加上旅大地区未计入的数字，北满的矿工渔民和散居“奥地”（即偏僻地区）的遗漏部分，估计到日本投降前，全东北的朝鲜人口当在二百万左右。但是，日寇投降后有几十万人陆续回了祖国，留下来的约有一百二十万人，其中百分之九十都成为被固着在东北土地上的农民了。
            朝鲜移民在东北的分布
    由于东北的朝鲜移民绝大多数是“开拓农”，并且大部分是经日本帝国主义者有计划地移殖过来的，所以它分布的地区很广泛，包括吉林、松江、辽东、辽西、黑龙江和热河等六个省；沈阳、长春等二十几个市；旅大地区以及内蒙自治区都或多或少地有着朝鲜移民。他们分布的密度则因各地区距离朝鲜本土的远近，“开拓期”的先后和自然条件、土地情况而有着很大的悬殊。现将各省区分布数字列表如后：

      ４、统计不到的区还有几十万的数字。
    如果我们在东北全图上从鸭绿江、图们江向西向北画出一些放射线去，就会形成一幅东北朝鲜人口分布形势草图。那就是吉林、辽东二省东部，松江省南部地区分布最密，沈阳、长春、哈尔滨一线迤西、迤北就很稀少了。吉林省东部，沿图们江的延吉、和龙、汪清、珲春、安图五县（伪满时建为间岛省），是朝鲜人最早移入的地区，也就是朝鲜人分布得最密的地区。据一九四三年的统计：这块地区以内共有朝鲜人六十一万七千余人，占全区人口四分之三强，几近全东北朝鲜人口的三分之一。其次，沈阳及其附近有十二万七千余人，松江省的牧丹江及延寿一带有十一万九千余人，通化、辑安一带有九万三千余人，安东、宽甸一带有六万六千余人。上述地区以外则比较分散。黑龙江及内蒙总计不过各有万人左右，热河不过一千多人。全部东北朝鲜人中，除了在沈阳、长春、牡丹江、安东、鞍山、抚顺等轻重工业发达的城市中各集中了六、七千至四、五万的工人、技术人员和一些从事其它职业的朝鲜人外，百分之九十五以上都是农民。
    东北解放后，人民政府对于朝鲜民族人口虽还没有比较精确的统计数字和分布情况，但据朝鲜民族人民政协代表朱德海报告的概括数字说：吉林省延边地区约有六十四万七千，松江省约有十九万六千，辽东省约有十五万五千，辽西省约有一万二千，黑龙江省约有二万三千，连其它地方合计起来，约共有一百二十万人。
            一直都在英勇不屈地斗争着
    为了打碎套在自己脖子上的奴隶枷锁，和为了反抗一个新的奴隶枷锁再套在自己的脖子上，朝鲜人民从被日寇灭亡的日子到抵抗美帝侵略的今天，一直都在英勇不屈地斗争着。在日本帝国主义者统治朝鲜的三十五年里，不顾镇压怎样血腥残酷，朝鲜人民的革命行动前仆后继始终未断。一九三一年“九一八”事变发生后，中朝人民的游击武装，在东北各地如春草般地滋长起来。以旧军队或绿林好汉形成的一个时期的抗日队伍，在此不提。仅中共领导下，从盘石、巴彦、饶河、珠河、宁安、汤原、海伦、密山及东南满等地区发展起来的抗日游击队里，就有朝鲜的工人、农民和知识分子几万人。盘石游击队就是在中朝人民抗日领袖、光荣的中共党员杨靖宇、李红光（朝鲜人）领导下，以中朝工农为基础建立起来的。在松花江下游乌苏里江右岸地区，有以崔石泉（朝鲜人）、李学福为首的饶河游击队，哈尔滨以东，有由赵尚志、李启东（朝鲜人）领导的珠河游击队，都是中朝人民联合结成的武装。此外更有完全由朝鲜人民组成的朝鲜独立革命军五千余人，活跃在鸭绿江沿岸；朝鲜人民革命军三千余人在“间岛”一带打击敌人。
    一九三六年一月，在中国共产党领导下，正式结成了东北抗日民主联军，它的主要领导者就是杨靖宇、赵尚志、李红光、金日成等中朝人民的抗日英雄。作为东北抗日联军基干队伍的一、二、三军都是中朝人民联合组成的，并且是在朝鲜民族聚居的地带发展壮大起来的。如抗联第一军的前身就是盘石游击队，抗联第二军的前身就是驰骋于东南满的中朝人民联合抗日游击队，抗联第三军的前身就是在延寿、珠河（今尚志县）地区成长壮大起来的珠河游击队。以上三路大军中几乎有半数是朝鲜同志。此外由宁安游击队发展起来的第五军、由汤原游击队发展成的第六军，和由饶河游击队发展起来的第七军里，也都有着相当多的朝鲜同志。总计在全部抗日战争中，先后有十数万朝鲜人民参加了这一艰苦的英雄事业。数以万计的朝鲜烈士为中朝民族解放战争的革命事业流血牺牲了。这牺牲是有代价的，它们给予日本帝国主义者无数有力的打击，留下了多少可歌可泣的故事教育人民，在伟大的人民解放斗争史中，写上了灿烂的一页。“战争教育了人民，人民将赢得战争”。中朝人民在并肩作战的年月里，增加了自己无限的胜利信心，锻炼了迎接胜利的力量，并为胜利准备了必要的条件。胜利的一天终于来到了，一九四五年八月，东北的中朝人民抗日武装配合了苏联红军，从日寇、汉奸、封建地主手里解放了东北、解放了朝鲜，中朝人民获得了伟大的，但是初步的革命果实。
            踊跃地参加了解放战争
    东北的朝鲜人民，在日本投降后有几十万人回到祖国去了。留下来的还有一百多万，他们已经习惯于住在他现在生活的环境里，那里有他们亲手垦植的土地，有自己亲手建筑的房屋，有亲如兄弟的邻侣。在人民政府的土地政策下，随着东北的土地改革，和中国人民同样地分到了土地，开始了他们祖孙三代梦寐追求的幸福生活。就在这个时候，美帝国主义的船舰飞机把美式装备的美帝走狗——蒋匪军运到东北去，穷凶极恶地妄想攫夺中朝人民用血汗换来的胜利果实。迫使中朝人民不得不重新拿起自己的武器来进行自卫。
    在三年的解放战争中，五万以上的朝鲜人民志愿地参加了中国人民解放军，在从东北一路解放到海南岛的中国人民解放军第四野战军中，多少万新的老的朝鲜同志英勇负责地站在各种岗位上。他们从司令员到战士，从炮手到坦克手，从开卡车到挖地雷，从医生到护士，从多少重要的艰苦的岗位上，从多少壮烈的决定性的战役里，涌现了无数的英雄模范。尤其值得我们深记不忘的是：数不清的朝鲜兄弟，为打倒我们共同的敌人流尽了他们最后的一滴血。在后方，上百万朝鲜人民热烈地生产支前，保证了中国革命的胜利。
            成了我国各民族大家庭中的一员
    用自己血汗换到的果实，自己有充分的权利来享受。一百二十万居住东北的朝鲜人民，在中国共产党的领导下，和人民政府的民族政策正确执行下，从“开拓农”、侨民的客籍地位转变为主人的一分子。他们和这个大家庭中的其他民族人民，平等地参加了解放后的各种政治、经济、文化等各方面的建设工作。随着解放战争的进展，在各个朝鲜人民聚居的地区，建立了自己的地方政权，在朝汉人民混居的地区，朝鲜人民也按人口比例参加了地方政权工作。一九四九年九月，中国人民政治协商会议开幕，东北境内的朝鲜人民，以中国境内少数民族的资格推派了代表，参加大会。历史上第一次以中华民族一分子的资格，和各兄弟民族见了面。从此，中华人民共和国各族人民间这个新的组成部分，才在各兄弟民族人民的观念里，从侨居中国的朝鲜人民中区划出来。
    东北的各地各界人民代表会议，很多都有朝鲜民族的代表参加，如沈阳、吉林、长春、公主岭等市的各界人民代表会议，都有一二位朝鲜民族代表参加，永吉县二百二十名代表中，有朝鲜民族代表五人以少数民族资格出席，其他代表（如农民）名额中的朝鲜民族代表还不在内。
    在中央人民政府及东北人民政府民族事务委员会里，都有朝鲜民族委员，在吉林省延边五县朝鲜民族聚居的地区，工作干部都是朝鲜人，松江省有三个朝鲜人民聚居的地区，和二百十四个朝汉混合区，共包括一百四十一个行政村，二百六十五个自然村，区村政府干部完全是朝鲜人。朝汉人民混居区里，也都有按民族人口比例选出的代表参加地方政权工作。截至一九五○年上半年，全东北共有朝鲜民族区及干部九百多人，县级干部二十七人，专员一人。并从各种训练班和学校里训练培养了各种工作干部六千二百多人，都已先后走上各种工作岗位。
            朝鲜民族的经济生活
    朝鲜民族是一个刚毅勇敢的民族，也是一个朴素勤劳的民族。东北的朝鲜民族人民，开垦了广大土地，把许多旱田变做水田。当日伪统治时期，除掉极少数农民种的是自己的地外，百分之九十几都是没有土地的农民，所以当时有：“汉人地主，朝鲜地户”的说法，他们向满铁拓植会社、满鲜拓植会社等经济侵掠机构，直接或间接租种地主的土地，受着日本帝国主义和封建地主的双重剥削。八一五以后，东北全面实行了土地改革，朝鲜人民和蒙汉人民同样地分得土地、耕畜、农具、房屋和其它生活资料。以松江省延寿县为例：解放前全县朝鲜人口二千二百七十五户，种地五万九千一百二十亩，其中只有四千五百亩地是自己的（占全耕地百分之七·六）。土改后全县朝鲜人口一千九百五十六户，分地七万一千五百七十亩，比全县朝鲜人民原有土地增加了十五倍还多，而耕地所有权百分之百地属于农民自己了。
    松江全省约共有水田九十三万六千零四十亩，其中百分之五十八的五十三万九千二百八十亩，在土改后已为“朝鲜地户”所有了。他们每户分地十三亩三分，每人平均得地二亩九分多。除土地外，全省朝鲜人共拥有大小牲畜二万头、牛马车九千多辆，各种农业机器二万余架，平均每两户有耕畜一头，每四户有车一辆。吉林省舒兰县徐家村张家街屯，五十一户朝鲜农民，土改后生产情绪高涨，改善了农业技术，三年中收获量增加了一倍，并将一百七十亩旱地变为水田，盖了十九间新房，打了十七眼洋井，过去全屯只有十七头牛，十一辆车，现在已有四十七头牛，二十八辆车了。
            三年中的文化建设
    朝鲜民族有一句老的谚语说：“中国人留给儿女财产，朝鲜人留给儿女文字”。但是在日伪反动统治下，实行奴化教育，朝鲜人民连自己民族语言、文字也不得自由学习和使用。朝鲜人被规定以日文为国语，学校里用的日文课本。没有，也不被允许有自己的学校。解放后在人民政府的领导帮助下，文化教育方面有着极迅速的发展，大量培养和改造了师资，增设学校。在延边朝鲜民族聚居地区，已建立起三百五十七所学校，包括大学一所，中学校二十五所，小学校三百三十一所。平均每个村就有小学校一所，每个县有中学校五所，共有学生十一万四千余人。松江省有朝鲜中学校十所，小学校三百七十一所。全东北现共有朝鲜民族的大学一所。师范学校四所，中学校七十余所，小学校一千五百余所。总计大、中、小学生二十余万人。他们恢复了通用朝鲜语言、文字，学校中通用朝鲜文课本。由于消除了朝鲜文中原来借用汉字的地方，一般都使用拼音的朝鲜文，因而大量地消灭了文盲。他们自己的朝鲜文报纸——东北朝鲜人民日报及工农报共发刊四万五千份，又办有自己的文化出版社一所，三年中出版教科书，参考书，工农读物及杂志等万余种，四十四万余部。
            他们有权利保卫祖国
    历史告诉了我们：日本帝国主义全部奴役朝鲜人民的日子，就是全部侵略中国的日子，历史也告诉了我们：中朝人民的团结，有足够的力量战胜侵略者。作为中华人民共和国组成民族之一的东北朝鲜民族，就是在艰苦卓绝的三四十年反侵略的革命历史斗争过程中，流了多少鲜血，牺牲了多少生命，勤劳生产，刻苦支前，赢得了抗日战争和人民解放战争而自然形成的。他们有权利住在他们所垦植的土地上，有权利参加人民的政权和人民的军队，有权利参加和享受政治、经济、文化的建设事业。我们其他民族人民以无限热情欢迎这个新的兄弟民族和我们一起建设我们的国家。今天，当鸭绿江对岸曾被日本帝国主义当作“征服亚洲大陆的桥梁”上迈着美帝国主义的狗腿时，居留在东北境内的朝鲜民族人民愿意回去保卫祖国，更是他们神圣的权利。我们其他兄弟民族人民，不但热烈地支援他们正义的行为，我们也有责任，有义务站在和我们二、三十年来患难相共的战友一起，痛惩那个正把战火燃向我们大门的美国强盗。
