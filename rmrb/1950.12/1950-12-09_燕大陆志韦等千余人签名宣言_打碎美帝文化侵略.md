    Yan Da Lu Zhiwei and over a thousand others sign a declaration
    Smash American imperialist cultural aggression
    At the Yan University faculty and staff current affairs discussion meetings on the 5th and 6th of this month, a general discussion was launched on the speech of the American representative to the Security Council, Austin. Professor Gao Chi'en and Professor Ai Weichao both pointed out that the purpose of American imperialism in establishing schools in China was precisely for cultural aggression, and certainly not to train talents for China. Students also expressed indignation when talking about this issue. Qiu Zhiying, a student in the Department of Education, said, "We should protest against Austin's insulting remarks against the Chinese people." Tian Zongtang and four other students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering jointly wrote a letter rebuking Austin, saying: "We are studying at Yenching University, which was founded by American imperialism, but we solemnly tell American imperialism that in Yenching—a place where imperialism prides itself—more than 90 percent of the students have participated in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. We have personally experienced the cultural aggression of imperialism, and we point our fingers at your noses, opposing your aggression and opposing your hypocrisy. In the Yenching campus, when a tree is blown down, imperialism can take out more than a thousand catties of millet to repair it. You are unwilling to cultivate China's own industrial talents, therefore, you do not issue funds for engineering. The Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University is funded by the Chinese people. We deeply know the purpose of your running schools in China, you want to control China's cultural sovereignty to act arbitrarily!" Finally, they said: "Your stinking money cannot buy the souls of Chinese youth."
    The University Labor Union's Culture and Education Committee, based on the demands of its members, wrote a declaration rebuking Austin. The declaration stated in brief: In his speech at the Security Council on November 28, Austin specifically mentioned Yenching University, absurdly listing Yenching University as an example of American imperialism's so-called "friendship" towards the Chinese people. As those who directly receive this "friendship"—the faculty, staff, and students of Yenching University—we must point out that this "friendship" is precisely a serious aggressive conspiracy by American imperialism to enslave China ideologically and culturally. The Chinese people can never forget under what motives and with what faces American imperialism offered these "friendships." The declaration said: "John Leighton Stuart, who founded Yenching University, served as the American ambassador to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government during the high tide of the Chinese people's revolution, under the guise of an 'educator.' He not only personally signed the 'Sino-American Commercial Treaty,' which virtually reduced China to a colony, and helped Chiang Kai-shek carry out an unprecedented civil war and massacre, causing millions of Chinese people to lose their happy families and lives, but also when Chinese students (including Yenching University students) rose up to oppose the revival of Japanese fascist forces fostered by American imperialism for the sake of the safety of their motherland, this John Leighton Stuart, who claimed to have always 'helped to enhance the happiness of Chinese students and their mature responsibility to their own country,' finally tore off his hypocritical mask and issued a threatening statement containing extremely serious implications to the Chinese people, falsely accusing the Chinese patriotic student movement of having other 'conspiracies' and other 'malicious intentions,' and even accused Chinese students of being 'ungrateful.'" The declaration concluded: "Austin's 'friendship' speech is not a new tune to the Chinese people. The faculty, staff, and students of Yenching University have to remind Austin, who is still daydreaming at the Security Council, and the imperialist elements he represents, to be sober. What we are doing now is completely contrary to what you hope for. We have long recognized your despicable conspiracy, and like all peace-loving people in China and the world, we not only hate, despise, and scorn you ideologically, but also have united with all peace-loving people in China and the world in action to resolutely smash the pig faces of all aggressors."
    On the morning of the 7th, at the University-wide teachers and students meeting held at Yenching University, the Labor Union representative read the full text of this declaration to all faculty, staff, and students, and called on everyone to sign the declaration. As of last night, 463 faculty and staff members had signed, including professors and associate professors Lu Zhiwei, Yan Jianbi, Gao Mingkai, Liang Qixiong, Yu Min, Sun Kaidi, Lin Geng, Zhang Boju, Zhao Luorui, Yu Dakun, Hou Renyuan, Deng Zhicheng, Qi Sihe, Nie Chongqi, Wang Zhonghan, Weng Dujian, Zhang Dongsun, Shen Naizhang, Chen Jingpan, Liao Taichu, Lin Handa, Jiang Yin'en, Sun Ruian, Xu Yongsan, Xu Xianyu, Dai Wensai, Chu Shenglin, Sun Degun, Gao Chi'en, Zhang Pang, Yu Shizhou, Cai Liusheng, Sun Lingxian, Liu Chengzhao, Chen Yi, Bai Heyi, Li Dezi, Geng Yaoxi, Ai Weichao, Chen Fangzhi, Zhang Xitong, Zhang Yanshen, Rao Yusu, Zheng Linzhuang, Zhang Weitao, Xiang Chong, Sun Xiaocun, Qian Jiaju, Zhao Chengxin, Lin Yaohua, Lei Jieqiong, Yan Jingyao, Jian Bozan, Zhao Zichen, Cai Yongchun, Fang Kuangyu, Zhao Zhanyuan, Zhou Xu Shuwen, and Lin Qiwu 59 people, and the students signed Feng Qixi, Liang Zhongren, Hua Yousan, Liu Dalin and other 1,035 people.

    燕大陆志韦等千余人签名宣言
    打碎美帝文化侵略
    本月五日及六日的燕大教职员时事讨论小组会上，对美国驻安理会代表奥斯汀的演说展开了普遍的讨论。高墀恩教授和艾维超教授都指出：美帝在中国开办学校的目的正是为了文化侵略，决不是为中国训练人才。同学之间谈到这问题也无不愤慨。教育系丘质英同学说：“奥斯汀这种侮辱中国人民的言论，我们应当提出抗议。”机械系田宗汤等五位同学联合写了一封斥奥斯汀的信说：“我们是在美帝办的燕京大学里读书，但是我们郑重的告诉美帝，在燕京——帝国主义自鸣得意的地方，有百分之九十以上的同学参加了抗美援朝的工作。我们亲身体会到了帝国主义的文化侵略，我们就指着你的鼻子，反对你的侵略，反对你的假仁假义。在燕京校园里有棵树刮倒了，帝国主义可拿出千余斤小米来整理，你们不愿培养中国自己的工业人才，因此，你们不发工科经费。清华大学的机械系是中国人民出钱办的。我们深知你们在中国办学校的目的，你们想控制中国的文化主权来任意胡为！”最后说：“你们的臭钱买不了中国青年的灵魂。”
    该校工会文教委员会，根据会员要求，写出斥奥斯汀的宣言。宣言略称：奥斯汀在十一月二十八日安理会上的演说里，特别提到了燕京大学，荒谬地把燕大列为美帝国主义对中国人民所谓“友谊”的例证之一。作为直接接受这种“友谊”的我们——燕大的教职工同学们必须指出，这种“友谊”正是美帝国主义企图在思想上文化上奴役中国的严重的侵略阴谋之一，中国人民从不能忘记美帝国主义这些“友谊”是根据怎样的动机和在怎样的嘴脸下拿出来的。宣言中说：“办燕京大学的司徒雷登，在中国人民革命的高潮中，打着‘教育家’的招牌做了美国驻蒋介石匪帮政府的大使，不但亲手签订了实际上沦中国为殖民地的‘中美商约’，帮助蒋介石进行空前的大内战大屠杀，使千万的中国人民丧失了幸福家庭和生命，而且当中国学生（包括燕京大学学生）为了祖国的安全，起来反对美帝扶植日本法西斯势力复活的时候，这位自称一向‘协助增进中国学生之幸福及其对自身国家之成熟责任’的司徒雷登，终于撕破他的伪善面孔，向中国人民发表了含有极严重威胁意味的恫吓声明，诬蔑中国爱国学生运动为别有‘阴谋’别有‘恶意企图’，居然责备中国学生为‘忘恩负义’。”宣言最后说：“奥斯汀这‘友谊’的演说，对中国人民已不是新调了。燕京大学的教职工同学们不得不在这里提醒一下，现在还在安理会白日说梦的奥斯汀以及他所代表的帝国主义分子，请他们清醒一点，我们现在所做的正和你们所希望的完全相反。我们早就认识了你们卑鄙的阴谋，我们和全中国以及全世界的爱好和平的人民一样，不仅在思想上仇视、鄙视、蔑视你们，而且在行动上已经和全中国以及全世界爱好和平的人们团结在一起，坚决打烂一切侵略者的猪嘴。”
    七日上午，在燕大举行的全校师生大会上，工会代表向全体教职员同学宣读了这宣言全文，并号召大家在这宣言上签名。截至昨晚，签名的教职员工已有四百六十三人，其中包括教授和副教授陆志韦、阎简弼、高名凯、梁启雄、俞敏、孙揩第、林庚、张伯驹、赵萝蕤、俞大捆、侯仁元、邓之诚、齐思和、聂崇岐、王钟翰、翁独健、张东荪、沈乃璋、陈景磐、廖泰初、林汉达、蒋荫恩、孙瑞岸、许勇三、徐献瑜、戴文赛、褚圣麟、孙德衮、高墀恩、张滂、于世胄、蔡镏生、孙令衔、刘诚钊、陈意、白和懿、李德滋、耿耀西、艾维超、陈芳芝、张锡彤、张雁深、饶毓苏、郑林庄、张伟韬、项冲、孙晓村、钱家驹、赵承信、林耀华、雷洁琼、严景耀、翦伯赞、赵紫宸、蔡咏春、方贶予、赵占元、周许淑文、林启武等五十九名，同学签名的有冯启禧、梁仲仁、华友三、刘达临等一千零三十五人。
