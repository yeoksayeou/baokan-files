    A Dirty Old Mouse
    On November 19th, the fourth day of the Second World Peace Congress, the American "representative" Roach delivered his long, stinking, and shameless speech at the congress. All the delegates to the congress, including the American representatives, booed him unanimously. Ms. Hardinov, the executive chairman of the day, had to ask the delegates to maintain order several times before everyone calmed down. The next day, American representative, black lawyer Howard, spoke. He solemnly and forcefully, word by word, refuted Roach's nonsense. When he revealed that Roach was a consultant to the Yugoslavian embassy in Washington, with an annual salary of $60,000, the whole audience erupted in a chorus of "woo-woo" jeers and disgusted boos. Roach used to be with the Progressive Party and had wormed his way into the standing committee of the first World Peace Congress. He has long since left the Progressive Party and openly exposed his face as a running dog for the imperialist war-mongers.
    Black singer and great American peace fighter Paul Robeson was unable to attend the congress this time due to obstruction by the reactionary American government, but recordings of his songs and speeches were played twice at the congress, winning unanimous and enthusiastic cheers and support from the delegates.
                --The author sees! A dirty old mouse scurries into the hall, and thousands of eyes radiate sword-like flashes. At first, it still wanted to peek, but soon it dared not look around again. Disgusted hisses rained down from all directions of the hall. Slandering peace, slandering China, slandering the Soviet Union, piecing together its master's platitudes, trying to cover up bloody crimes. Praising Tito, praising traitors, singing it over and over again. A viper wearing human skin, its forked tongue twirling in its mouth. But the snakeskin was stripped off at once, and its shameless true form was completely exposed. The brave black lawyer pointed his finger and accused him word by word: He is a running dog of the Yugoslavian traitors, his master is the Tito government. Sixty thousand US dollars bought everything he had, lock, stock, and barrel. He cannot represent the American delegation, nor can he represent the American people. The representatives of the American people are Howard Fast, are Paul Robeson. He used to be with the Progressive Party, but now he regrets his past words, he even regrets the American Civil War, regrets the American Revolution! Three thousand people in the hall burst into thunderous applause, and thousands of lights illuminated raised arms like a forest. From the other half of the earth came Robeson's majestic singing, as if the hall had arrived to the millions of peace-loving American people. They smashed the fascist chains, broke through Truman's prison doors, they shed tears of joy and embraced us tightly! Only he - Roach - sat with his thick lips closed, silent, like the corpse of a mouse floating on the sea.
               Warsaw, November 22, 1950.

    一只肮脏的老鼠
    十一月十九日，第二届世界保卫和平大会第四日，美国“代表”罗奇在大会上发表他的又臭又长的无耻演说。大会全体代表，连美国代表在内，一致加以嘘斥。当天的执行主席哈地诺瓦女士不得不几次请代表们维持秩序，大家才静下来。次日，美国代表黑人律师哈华特发言。他庄严而有力地，一个字一个字郑重地驳斥罗奇的谰言。当他揭发罗奇是南斯拉夫驻华盛顿使馆的顾问，年俸六万美金时，全场爆发了一阵“呜——呜”的讥刺与厌恶的嘘声。罗奇过去是进步党，混进了第一届和大的常设委员会。现在早已脱离进步党，公开暴露了替帝国主义战争贩子做走狗的面目。
    黑人歌唱家，美国的伟大和平斗士罗伯逊此次因美国反动政府阻挠不能出席大会，但他的歌唱和演说的录音在大会上曾放送了两次，获得代表们一致的狂热的欢呼和拥护。
                ——作者看！一只肮脏的老鼠窜进了会场，几千对眼睛放射出利剑似的闪光。最初它还想偷看，马上它再也不敢张望，厌恶的嘘声像暴雨般来自会场四方。诬蔑和平，诬蔑中国，诬蔑苏联，拼凑着它主子的滥调想把血腥的罪行遮掩。赞扬铁托，赞扬叛徒，唱了一遍又是一遍。毒蛇披着人衣，嘴里转动着叉形的舌尖。可是蛇皮一下就给剥光，无耻的原形完全暴露。那勇敢的黑人律师用手指着，一字一字地控诉：他是南斯拉夫叛徒的走狗，他的主子是铁托政府。六万元美金收买了他的一切，连皮带骨。他既不能代表美国代表团，也不能代表美国人民。美国人民的代表是哈华·法斯特，是保罗·罗伯逊。他过去是进步党，可是现在他懊悔过去自己的说话，甚至他也懊悔南北美战争，懊悔美国的独立革命！三千人的会场响起了春雷似的掌声，千万道灯光照亮了高举的手臂好像森林。从地球的那一半传来了罗伯逊的雄壮的歌声，仿佛会场上来到了千千万万爱好和平的美国人民。他们打碎了法西斯的锁链，冲破了杜鲁门的牢门，他们流着欢欣的眼泪和我们拥抱得紧紧！只有他——罗奇——闭着厚嘴唇坐着，默不作声，好像是大海上飘着一只老鼠的尸身。
               一九五○、十一、二十二，华沙。
