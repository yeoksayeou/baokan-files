    Decides to Expand the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    Launches Effort to Write Four Thousand Letters to Comfort Chinese and Korean People's Soldiers
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy held a symposium at the Cultural Club of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at 2:00 PM on the 17th to convey the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and expand the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. More than 40 members attended. Ma Xulun, Chairman of the Association, Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman, and Xu Guangping, Secretary-General, were all present. First, Lin Handa, Director of the Branch Council, conveyed the political report of the Second Plenary Session, and Feng Binfu, Deputy Director of the Council, conveyed the report on Association affairs. Chairman Ma and Vice Chairman Wang, in addition to giving instructions on Association affairs, made important analyses of the current situation of Resist America, Aid Korea, and called on all members to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Association and launch Resist America, Aid Korea work. Then, the members spoke enthusiastically, expressing their determination to support the Korean people's war against aggression to the end with positive actions. In addition to those who had already signed up to join the volunteer army and donate money, a proposal was immediately launched to write four thousand letters of comfort to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Members responded enthusiastically, and those responsible for mobilizing reached more than two thousand eight hundred letters. In order to eliminate pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American sentiments, members successively suggested planning and preparing to convene various mass symposiums and accusation meetings to expose the various crimes of American imperialism in military, political, economic, and cultural fields, and to protest against Austin's shameless slander against the Chinese people. Female comrades also called on all male members to mobilize their spouses to organize family women's Resist America, Aid Korea groups and actively promote Resist America, Aid Korea activities.
