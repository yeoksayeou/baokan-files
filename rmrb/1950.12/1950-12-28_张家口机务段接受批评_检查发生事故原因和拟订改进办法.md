    Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot Accepts Criticism
    Examines Causes of Accidents and Formulates Improvement Measures
To the Editors:

    The People's Daily's December 9th criticism, "Why Have Accidents Been Occurring Continuously at the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot Recently?" and its suggestions are correct. We sincerely accept them and have conducted an investigation. We are submitting the results of our investigation now, and hope that you will provide us with more opinions in the future to help us improve our work.

    In addition to the reasons Comrade Lan Ying put forward, our investigation reveals the following causes for the continuous accidents at our depot:

    (1) After establishing the collective contract and the model locomotive team in September, we maintained over eighty days without accidents, accumulating more than 280,000 safe kilometers. As a result, the leadership believed that with the collective contract, accidents could be eliminated, and they relaxed the education of employees regarding accident prevention, leading to complacency among the staff.

    (2) Untimely handling of problems. For example, the coal-saving bonus was higher than other safety rewards, causing the crew to neglect safety. The leadership was aware of this issue beforehand but did not correct it in time. In addition, the longer running time between Zhangjiakou and Datong makes the crew mentally fatigued, making accidents more likely. The leadership knew about this problem for some time, but still has not found a solution.

    (3) Incomplete implementation of regulations. For example, the recent damage to the main bearing shell of Locomotive T61584 was due to the incomplete execution of the supervision and acceptance system.

    (4) Technical education focused only on imparting knowledge and lacked integration with practice and discussion. There was also a lack of special attention to the education of individual crew members with weaker technical skills. For example, driver Li Shiyuan had previously run a signal at Zhangjiakou Station, but the leadership did not focus on guiding and educating him, which led to another accident of damaging the driving wheel (due to lack of experience and confidence in speed observation and control).

    After this investigation, we have formulated the following measures to prevent accidents in the future: First, combine theory with practice to strengthen the operational skills training for the contracted locomotive teams; and summarize the operational methods of Song Ruzhang, driver of Red Flag Locomotive MK11928, for all crew members to study, and promote typical experiences after they are found. Second, strengthen the responsibility system, strictly implement the reporting and inspection system that is integrated with reality, and handle problems promptly after they are discovered.

    In addition, Comrade Lan Ying’s estimate of the loss of 18.1 billion due to the damage of MK11712 locomotive was based on the wear thickness of the wheel, the kilometers it could run, and the net income calculated by pulling a full train. In our opinion, it is more appropriate to calculate the cost of wheel wear material, the labor costs of repairs, and the lost value of increasing the overhaul rate.

### 张家口机务段接受批评  检查发生事故原因和拟订改进办法

    张家口机务段接受批评
    检查发生事故原因和拟订改进办法编辑同志：
    人民日报十二月九日“张家口机务段近来为什么接连发生事故？”的批评及建议都是正确的，我们诚恳接受，并进行了检查。今将检查结果寄上，希望今后多向我们提出意见，帮助我们改进工作。
    我段接连发生事故的原因，除了蓝英同志所提出的以外，经我们检查，还有以下几点：
    （一）自九月份订立集体合同、成立模范机车队后，保持了八十余日无事故，累计公里成绩达二十八万多安全公里。由此，领导上便认为有了集体合同，便可以把事故消灭，松懈了对职工的警惕事故教育，因而造成了工作人员的麻痹大意思想。
    （二）处理问题不及时。如节煤奖高于其他安全奖励，使乘务员忽视安全这一问题，领导同志事先已有感觉，但没有及时纠正。此外，张家口大同间乘务时间较长，乘务员精神疲劳，亦易发生事故。领导同志早知道了这个问题，但至今仍没有解决的办法。
    （三）执行制度不彻底。如最近攵Ｔ六一五八四号机车之大元瓦烧损，就是因为监修与验收制度没有彻底执行。
    （四）对技术教育上只着重贯输，缺乏结合实际，讨论研究；尤其对个别技术较差的乘务员也没有特别注意教育。如司机李士元曾在张家口站发生过冒进信号事故，但领导干部对他没有抓紧指导教育，以致又发生了揸伤动轮事故（原因是对速度观测与操纵上没有经验与信心）。
    经过这次检查，我们拟定今后防止事故的办法：首先，结合实际，加强包车组的操纵技术教育；并总结冖ㄎ一一九二八号红旗机车司机长宋汝璋的操纵法，供全体乘务员研究，找得典型经验后推广施行。其次，加强负责制，严格执行汇报与结合实际的检查制度，发现问题后及时处理。
    此外，蓝英同志对冖ㄎ一一七一二机车损失一八一亿的估价，是根据外轮的磨耗厚度、能行驶的公里，以牵引满轴计算所得的纯收益计算的。我们的意见，应该以外轮磨耗材料费，修理的人工费和提高检修率损失价值三项计算，较为恰当。          张家口机务段长  张尔炎
