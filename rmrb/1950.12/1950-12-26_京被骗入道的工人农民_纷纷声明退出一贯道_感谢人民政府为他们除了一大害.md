(Report from our newspaper) Since the Beijing Municipal People's Government announced the decree banning Yiguandao, workers in various factories and farmers in the suburbs have been complaining about the crimes of Yiguandao. Many workers and farmers who were deceived into joining the sect have announced their withdrawal. The railway trade union in the Fengtai area began publicizing the decree to ban Yiguandao on the 19th, while strengthening the security work of the picket team to prevent retaliation and sabotage by reactionary elements. In just two days, 249 Yiguandao followers among the railway workers in the area reported to the trade union and declared their withdrawal. Three altar masters registered with the Public Security Section and handed over a large number of superstitious paraphernalia. Simultaneously with the banning of Yiguandao, followers of other reactionary and backward secret societies and sects, such as Xiantian Dao, Hunyuan Dao, Baiyang Dao, Zhengzi Hui, and Anqing Bang, also declared their withdrawal. Many workers who had joined the sect made self-criticisms when declaring their withdrawal. For example, worker Yao Rongting from the rolling stock inspection section said, "I am a glorious member of the working class, yet I believed in Yiguandao, which serves the American-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and feudal forces. This is truly shameful. I must quickly wash away this stain and stop embarrassing the working class." The Changxindian Railway Trade Union also went deep into the workshops to carry out propaganda and mobilize deceived workers to withdraw from the sect. Two Yiguandao followers from the Beijing Travel Service of the Tianjin Railway Administration exposed the deceptive dark secrets of Yiguandao. The Qinghe Mud Factory held a workers' meeting and a forum. The workers who had joined Yiguandao all publicly declared their withdrawal at the meeting. More than twenty employees of the tram company have already withdrawn from the sect. Li Shuqin, an 18-year-old female worker, recounted how her father and brother were treated to death by Yiguandao, leading to the ruin of her family. She said, "Now that the People's Government has banned Yiguandao, I feel indescribably happy." That evening, she persuaded her mother to withdraw from the sect. Yiguandao followers among the workers of the Telecommunications Bureau, Tram Repair Factory, Mentougou Heishan Mine, and Beijing Clothing Factory have also declared their withdrawal. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant reported a hidden Yiguandao ringleader. After education by the trade union, five more people withdrew from Yiguandao.

After the farmers' representatives in the 11th district of Beijing suburbs conveyed the decree banning Yiguandao to the villages, the farmers happily believed that the government should have removed this great evil long ago! Deceived followers reported their withdrawal at mass meetings and village offices. In Jiugong Village alone, more than 100 followers announced their withdrawal on the 20th. By the 21st, nine or more Yiguandao followers above the level of family altar master in the entire district had registered with the Public Security Sub-bureau. A mass anti-Yiguandao movement is now being launched in the villages. In addition, Beijing Agricultural University is carrying out propaganda to ban Yiguandao in villages such as Balizhuang and Mashenmiao.

Many workers and farmers who declared their withdrawal, while denouncing Yiguandao, thanked the People's Government for its measures to rescue them and demanded that the ringleaders of Yiguandao be severely punished.

    【本报讯】自从北京市人民政府公布取缔一贯道的法令后，各厂工人及郊区农民纷纷控诉一贯道罪行，不少被骗入道的工人、农民宣布退道。丰台地区的铁路工会在十九日开始宣传取缔一贯道的法令，同时加强纠察队的保卫工作，防止反动分子报复破坏。仅两天时间，该区铁路职工中的一贯道徒已有二百四十九名到工会报告声明退道，三个坛主到公安段登记，并交出大批迷信法具。与取缔一贯道同时，其他反动落后会道门的道徒，如先天道、混元道、白阳道、政字会、安清帮等道徒也纷纷声明退道。许多入道的工人在声明退道时，作了自我批评，如检车段的工友么荣庭说：“我是一个光荣的工人阶级，竟信这给美蒋特务和封建势力服务的一贯道，这真是耻辱，我要赶紧把这污点洗净，别再给工人阶级丢人。”长辛店铁路工会也深入车间宣传，动员受骗工人退道。天津铁路管理局北京旅行服务社的两个一贯道徒揭露了一贯道的骗人黑幕。清河制泥厂举行了工人大会及座谈会，参加一贯道的工人在会上均公开声明退道。电车公司的职工已有二十几人退道，十八岁的女工李书琴诉说她的父亲和哥哥被一贯道治病致死，弄得家破人亡，她说：“现在人民政府取缔一贯道，我真有说不出的痛快。”当晚她就劝自己的母亲退了道。电信局、电车修造厂、门头沟黑山矿、北京被服厂工人中的一贯道徒，也纷纷声明退道。石景山钢铁厂工人检举了一个隐蔽的一贯道首恶分子，经工会进行教育后，又有五人退出了一贯道。
    京郊十一区的农民代表把取缔一贯道的法令传达到各村后，农民们高兴地认为：政府早该除这一大害了！被骗道徒纷纷在群众会上和村公所报告退道。只旧宫村在二十日一天就有一百多名道徒宣布退道，全区到二十一日有九个家坛主以上的一贯道徒到公安分局登记。现各村正展开群众性的反一贯道运动。此外，北京农业大学在八里庄、马神庙等村正进行取缔一贯道的宣传。
    很多声明退道的工人、农民，在控诉一贯道同时，感谢人民政府的措施搭救了他们，要求对一贯道首恶分子严厉惩处。
