Xinhua News Agency, 18th. New York News: At a press conference held on the 16th, Wu Xiuquan, representative of the People's Republic of China, distributed a document that was the speech prepared by Representative Wu for the Political and Security Committee of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The document is entitled "Speech by Wu Xiuquan, Representative of the People's Republic of China, in Support of the Soviet Representative Vyshinsky's Accusation of US Aggression Against China at the United Nations Political and Security Committee," the full text of which is as follows:

    I have listened to the speech by Soviet Representative Mr. Vyshinsky at the November 27th meeting of the Political and Security Committee accusing the United States of aggression against China. I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, fully support and uphold the entire speech made by Soviet Representative Mr. Vyshinsky accusing the United States of aggression against China. The Soviet Union has always been a great friend of the Chinese people in history. Long before the success of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union, it announced the abolition of the unequal treaties concluded between Tsarist Russia and China, and adopted a truly equal policy towards China. After the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union concluded with us the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between China and the Soviet Union, which fixed the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples in the form of a treaty. Mr. Vyshinsky's speech once again proves that the Soviet Union is the most reliable friend and ally of the Chinese people in the process of opposing imperialist aggression and building a people's China. All imperialist aggressors, first and foremost the US imperialist aggressors, fear the unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and fear the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which opposes imperialist aggression and safeguards the common interests of China and the Soviet Union. With Sino-Soviet unity, the imperialists' acts of aggression will be difficult to carry out. The solid united strength of the seven hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union is the greatest obstacle to imperialist aggression. Therefore, in desperation, the imperialist aggressors have come up with various ways to sow discord between the two great allied nations of China and the Soviet Union. However, I want to tell these imperialists that the great unity of China and the Soviet Union is unshakable, and your plots to sow discord are futile, doomed to failure, and have already failed.

    I also listened to the reply by US Representative Mr. Dulles to Mr. Vyshinsky's speech. Mr. Dulles' reply to Mr. Vyshinsky, as well as Mr. Austin's speech in the Security Council on this issue and his reply to my speech in the Security Council, and the defense of the US representative by British Representative Mr. Jebb—all these speeches, replies, and defenses are distortions of facts, reversals of right and wrong, and cannot withstand refutation. They said a lot, but no matter whether they are talking about history, philosophy, politics, or economics, they cannot justify themselves. The root cause is that they insist on aggression and insist on defending aggression; they want to portray aggression as defense, anti-aggression as aggression, war as peace, right as wrong, and black as white. No matter how capable they are, they simply cannot do it. Take the issue we are currently discussing, can they say that the huge thing in the Taiwan Strait—the US Seventh Fleet, which is invading Chinese territory Taiwan—does not exist? Can they say that the fact that thousands of US planes have violated Chinese airspace hundreds of times, bombing, strafing, and conducting reconnaissance, has not happened? They cannot.

    They cannot do this, but they have to do it—this is the mission of Mr. Dulles, Mr. Austin, and other representatives of the US-British bloc here.

    Mr. Dulles pretends to be a compassionate gentleman, starting with the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. Okay, let's talk about the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. Does a deep friendship exist between the Chinese and American peoples? Yes. I already said when I arrived in New York: "A deep friendship has always existed between the Chinese and American peoples"; I want to emphasize now that not only has there been a deep friendship between the Chinese and American peoples in the past, but there is a deep friendship now, and this friendship will continue to exist in the future. However, the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples and the so-called "friendship" between the US imperialist aggressors and the invaded Chinese people, as mentioned by Mr. Dulles, Mr. Austin, Mr. Acheson, and Mr. Truman, is in no way the same. Mr. Dulles and Mr. Austin spent considerable effort in their speeches to prove the existence of the so-called friendship of the US imperialist aggressors towards the Chinese people. According to Mr. Dulles, this friendship stems not primarily from US commercial interests in China, but from cultural and humanitarian motives. It is said that US imperialists' relations with China have been like this for 150 years. What exactly was the so-called friendship of US imperialism towards the Chinese people in history, what was the actual content of their cultural and humanitarian efforts in China, and who exactly were their friends in China?

    Like Britain, US imperialists were also among the first opium dealers to bring opium to China. A large part of the opium confiscated in Guangzhou in 1839 came from the hands of US opium dealers. During the Opium War, US Navy Commander Kearny personally led a fleet to the Chinese seas to support the British army. In July 1844, it forced the Qing government to sign the Treaty of Wangxia with the United States. It was the first to create the clauses of "extraterritoriality" and "equal opportunities." The Treaty of Wangxia was one of the earliest unequal treaties signed between the Chinese Qing government and foreign governments. From 1853 to 1860, when the Anglo-French Allied Forces invaded China and advanced on Tianjin and Beijing, US warships also participated in the operations and took the opportunity to coerce the Qing government into signing the Sino-American Tianjin Treaty (1858), obtaining special privileges such as restricting Chinese tariffs and navigating Chinese inland waterways.

    In 1862, the US Consul General in Shanghai instructed Americans Ward and others to jointly organize an army with the British to help the Qing government suppress the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement of the Chinese people.

    In 1872, US troops attacked Korea. In 1873, in addition to attacking Korea, they joined Japan in attacking Taiwan, and in 1874, they joined Japan again in attacking Korea.

    In 1900, the United States participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance to invade China and, in the Boxer Protocol, jointly obtained with other imperialists the privilege of stationing troops in Beijing and other places.

    In September 1917, US Secretary of State Lansing and Japanese Foreign Minister Ishii signed an agreement recognizing Japan's special privileges in China. In 1919, the US government again recognized Japan's succession to Germany's privileges in Shandong at the Paris Peace Conference.

    From 1922 to 1924, the US government aided the Zhili warlords Cao Kun and Wu Peifu with military supplies and loans to carry out civil war.

    In the "May 30th" Massacre in 1925, US imperialists participated in the massacre of the Chinese people.

    In April 1927, in order to suppress the Chinese Great Revolution, especially to induce Chiang Kai-shek to surrender to imperialism, the US government joined Britain in shelling Nanjing, creating the "Xiaguan Massacre."

    From 1931 to 1933, the US government aided the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek with loans (including one for 50 million US dollars), aircraft, and military advisors to attack the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army led by the Chinese Communist Party.

    During the Japanese invasion of China, the US government supplied Japan with a large amount of military materials. According to Japanese official materials, in 1935, US military supplies imported into Japan accounted for 33.5% of Japan's total imported military supplies, and in March 1940, it increased to 38.5%. The waste iron exported by the US to Japan still accounted for 50% of Japan's total imported waste iron by the end of 1941.

    After Japan surrendered, the US government actively invaded China, attempting to replace Japan in ruling China and turning China into a US colony. On November 4, 1946, the US government signed the notorious aggressive treaty, the "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation," seizing China's economic sovereignty, tariff sovereignty, and coastal and inland river navigation rights. Even a British Member of Parliament called it "the most barbaric economic aggression against China ever seen."

    After Japan surrendered, the US government helped Chiang Kai-shek launch a large-scale anti-people civil war with money, military supplies, weapons, and military advisors. From around the time of Japan's surrender until June 1948, according to known materials, the US government provided Chiang Kai-shek with more than 6 billion US dollars in various assistance. This is the huge investment made by the US government in Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war.

    This 150-year history proves that US imperialists have consistently invaded China. Their so-called friendship towards the Chinese people is nothing but another name for aggression; their cultural and humanitarian efforts in China were actually just means to achieve this aggression; their friends in China, from the Qing emperors, Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, Yuan Shikai, Wu Peifu, Cao Kun, to Chiang Kai-shek, who is spurned by all the Chinese people, were all assistants who helped them carry out aggression.

    It is known to all that the US government's best friend in China is currently Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek is the best friend of US imperialism, but Chiang Kai-shek is the irreconcilable enemy of the Chinese people. Does this not perfectly prove that US imperialists have always been friends of the enemies of the Chinese people and enemies of the Chinese people?

    Mr. Dulles and Mr. Austin here promoted the US's "open door" policy towards China in history and believed that this was the highest expression of the US ruling group's friendship towards the Chinese people. But what exactly is the content of the so-called "open door" policy? The so-called "open door" means that China's door must be open to US imperialists and other imperialists alike, that US imperialists oppose other imperialist countries monopolizing China, and that their purpose is for US imperialists to "share the spoils" of aggression against China and to "equally share" the "benefits" of exploiting China. Is this not clear?

    The US ruling group has established many cultural, religious, and humanitarian undertakings in China, and indeed many kind-hearted American people have listened to their deceptive propaganda and participated in these undertakings. However, the actual purpose and objective effect of establishing these undertakings, on the whole, is to paralyze the Chinese people and prevent them from resisting US aggression.

    The best explanation of the US imperialists' so-called "friendship" towards the Chinese people is the so-called assistance from the US government to China, as promoted here by Mr. Dulles and Mr. Austin. Has the US government "assisted" China? Yes. However, the US government has "assisted" the enemies of the Chinese people, assisting them in suppressing the Chinese people and massacring the Chinese people. Mr. Austin said that in the past thirteen years, the US government has even provided an average of 100 million US dollars per year in so-called "assistance" to China. Mr. Austin also said that the actual figure is more than this. After the war, the US government used a large amount of guns, cannons, bombs, military supplies, aircraft, and warships to assist the Chiang Kai-shek government in carrying out civil war. But what is the consequence of this so-called "assistance" from the US government? Chiang Kai-shek used US weapons to massacre millions of Chinese people. Here I have a collection of photographs of some of the US weapons captured by the Chinese People's Liberation Army from the Kuomintang reactionary army, please pass them around. This is the ironclad evidence of US imperialism massacring the Chinese people through the hands of Chiang Kai-shek.

    A deep friendship has always existed between the Chinese and American peoples, but the US imperialists have only aggression towards China and the Chinese people. The Chinese people have never had any friendship with the US imperialists and the US ruling group, only hatred. This hatred is the inevitable result of the US imperialist policy of aggression against China. Due to this US imperialist policy of aggression against China, which has already reached the stage of armed aggression against China, the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples is undergoing a crisis of being destroyed. But Mr. Dulles, who pretends to be compassionate, who is destroying the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples? It is not a third party that is destroying this friendship between the peoples, but the US government, the US ruling group, the US imperialists, the US government's policy and actions of armed aggression against China, and the US imperialists sending American youth to the Taiwan Strait and Chinese airspace to be enemies of the Chinese people. Has there ever been a Chinese fleet sailing to the US Strait preparing to fight the American people? Have Chinese planes ever flown into US airspace to bomb American women and infants? Was it not US President Truman who proposed considering using the sinful weapon of the atomic bomb to destroy the Chinese and Korean peoples?

    The US imperialism's aggression against China has now changed from a historically covert and roundabout form to a blatant and undisguised form of armed aggression.

    Taiwan is an unshakeable and indivisible part of Chinese territory. The liberation of Taiwan by the Central People's Government of the People’s Republic of China constitutes the exercise of sovereignty over its own territory and is a strictly internal affair of China that does not allow any foreign government to interfere. However, President Truman openly dispatched US armed forces to Taiwan, determined to prevent our Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan. This is clearly a blatant and undisguised armed aggression by US imperialism against Chinese territory. However, the US representatives and their henchmen say that Taiwan's status "is one of the territories that formerly belonged to Japan, and its handling, like other territories that formerly belonged to Japan, remains a matter of international concern." These British and American bloc representatives have forgotten that Taiwan has always been an indivisible part of Chinese territory in history, the residents of Taiwan are Chinese, and are governed by the Chinese government. It was only taken by Japan in 1895, its handling was not only already decided in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, but it has also been realized for five years after the war. US Representative Austin said that the US invaded Taiwan to "neutralize it militarily." However, according to the UN Charter and international regulations, there is no reason that can be used as a reason for the US government to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and invade the territory of other countries. The so-called US armed forces invading Taiwan to neutralize Taiwan militarily inadvertently proves the US's aggression against Taiwan. Mr. Dulles said that the US did not invade Taiwan because, according to him, there were only forty-four US military personnel stationed in Taiwan. Mr. Dulles thinks that this proves that the US has not invaded Taiwan; but Mr. Dulles did not tell us how many military personnel are on the US Seventh Fleet, and where exactly is this fleet now. Mr. Dulles adopted the method of turning "yes" into "no" to defend the US invasion of Taiwan, but Mr. Dulles' sophistry cannot make the Seventh Fleet invading Taiwan disappear. Mr. Austin adopted another tactic, that is, not denying the fact that the US Seventh Fleet invaded the Taiwan Strait, but attempting to intentionally deny the treaties and facts that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and even daring to ask me what the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China intends to do with Taiwan? The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan from the shameless US aggressors. We are determined to do this, and we have the power to do this. The US government will be responsible for all the consequences arising from this. Mr. Austin attempted to use the name of the United Nations to legitimize the illegal actions of the US in invading Taiwan, and to find a few more accomplices to invade Taiwan. However, I want to tell Mr. Austin that any illegal resolution of the United Nations under the manipulation of the US government has not the slightest binding force on the Chinese people. The Chinese people are not only determined to defeat the main aggressor they are facing, but also determined to defeat all aggressors who dare to invade Chinese territory.

    Mr. Dulles dared not deny the aggressive facts that the US Air Force invading Korea violated Chinese airspace to carry out bombing, strafing, and reconnaissance activities, but Mr. Dulles said that of the 83 violations of Chinese airspace by US aircraft raised by the Soviet delegation on November 15, 61 were for reconnaissance purposes. We now ask Mr. Dulles, assuming that even if it is an invasion of Chinese airspace for reconnaissance purposes, does that not count as an act of aggression? Assuming that Chinese planes flew over New York for reconnaissance, what would Mr. Dulles' reaction be? The US representative also said that if the facts prove that US military aircraft did invade Chinese airspace, bombed Chinese towns, and killed and injured Chinese people, the US government is willing to compensate with a certain amount of money. You see, how easily the US representatives speak! But I want to solemnly tell the US representatives that the national sovereignty of the People's Republic of China cannot be bought with your money. I also want to tell the US representatives that you are currently encountering a lot of trouble in this world, and one of the sources of this trouble is because you always think that your money can buy the sovereignty of any country, but you have forgotten that China is now a country where the people are in power, and the sovereignty of this country cannot be bought with your few stinky coins; what you can buy is only the sovereignty of the old China under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek. But, unfortunately for you, this ruling group of the old China, despite receiving your hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes, was finally driven off the Chinese mainland by the Chinese people. Mr. Dulles, this is the root cause of your hostility towards the Chinese people.

    Mr. Austin said: "Since the establishment of the Beijing government, the US government has never been aggressive towards China, towards Korea, or in its actions in Korea." However, it is not easy for a robber with stolen goods hidden all over his body to pretend to be a saint entering heaven.

    Now, I present the following facts, based on which I accuse the US government of interference, aggression, and hostile actions against China.

    (1) The US government is actively assisting the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group in Taiwan to struggle, directing it to blockade the Chinese coast and bomb Chinese coastal cities. The US is constantly shipping military supplies, weapons, and other materials to Taiwan. According to incomplete statistics, from January to October this year, the US and Canadian governments gave the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group hundreds of aircraft and more than seven hundred tanks. US officers are training Kuomintang troops in Taiwan to fight the Chinese people. The US war peddler, former commander of the US Air Force 14th Air Force, Chennault, openly declared: "To strangle the communists with hunger, a blockade is necessary." The fact that the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group used US planes to bomb Chinese coastal cities is a fact known to the world; on February 6, Chiang Kai-shek used US planes to carry out barbarous bombing of Shanghai, killing and injuring more than a thousand people and destroying a large number of houses and property, which the Chinese people will never forget. In addition to openly and actively assisting the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group in their struggle, the US government is also attempting to undermine the People's Republic of China from within. The US government's spy agencies are colluding with the Kuomintang spy agencies, directing special agents and bandits to carry out various sabotage activities. According to statistics from the Southwest Military and Political Committee of our country, 60% of the important bandit leaders in the southwest provinces have received training from US-Chiang special agents. The same Chennault also openly declared in the recent November 18 issue of Life magazine: "A plan for military assistance to Chinese anti-communist guerrillas is practical, it does not cost much American money; it can save many American lives."

    (2) The US government is using various methods to obstruct the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China from participating in the UN and the Allied Council for Japan, while forcibly allowing the anti-Chinese public enemy, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionary group in Taiwan, to illegally occupy our country's seat. Our Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai has been constantly requesting the UN to expel the representatives of the illegal Kuomintang reactionary group since as early as November 15 last year. Representatives from the Soviet Union, India, and other countries have also repeatedly made the same suggestions in the UN General Assembly and the Security Council, but these reasonable demands and suggestions have been rejected by the US and the countries under its command. Thus, up to now, the US government has not only allowed the delegation of the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionary group to remain in the UN, but has also directed a group of its lackeys to attack the reasonable accusations of the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China.

    (3) The US government is actively arming the Japanese fascist forces. The Japanese fascist forces are being revived. Disregarding repeated protests and warnings from our government, General MacArthur illegally released a large number of Japanese war criminals who invaded China. The Japanese army is being re-established under the name of "Police Reserve Force" by the US authorities in Japan. The Japanese police force already has 125,000 people; the Japanese navy is also being restored. The Japanese so-called "Maritime Safety Agency" now has 300 ships. The US government is planning to make a separate peace with Japan in order to monopolize Japan. Recently, the US State Department, in a memorandum to the Far Eastern Commission regarding a peace treaty with Japan, actually openly proposed that the status of Chinese territory Taiwan should be decided by consultation between the US, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. One can imagine what the US government considers a peace treaty with Japan to be. The purpose of the US government's adoption of such a policy towards Japan is undoubtedly to turn Japan into a military base for US imperialism to carry out aggressive war in the East. Moreover, the US government has already used this military base—Japan and Japanese fascist warlords—to launch armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan and China's neighboring country Korea.

    (4) The US government has established a huge network of military bases in the Pacific, starting with the US military base in Alaska, passing through the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Ryukyu, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and extending to Thailand. Anyone can see that this network of bases is taking an encirclement formation against the new China. MacArthur has publicly admitted that this network of bases targets China and the Soviet Union for encirclement and attack.

    The US government's simultaneous armed aggression against our territory Taiwan and our neighboring country Korea is not only the inevitable result of US imperialism's consistent aggression against China, but also a pre-planned step for further comprehensive attack on the People's Republic of China. The US government's aggression against Taiwan is of course to make Taiwan a springboard for US imperialism to attack the Chinese mainland, and armed aggression against Korea is also making Korea a springboard for US imperialism to attack the Chinese mainland.

    The US government's aggression against Korea threatened our country's security from the beginning; later, the US government, disregarding repeated warnings from our government, ordered the US troops invading Korea to stubbornly extend the flames of aggressive war to our northeast border. The purpose of the US government in doing so can only be to further invade China after completely occupying Korea. Countless historical facts prove that the end point reached by the aggressor in the first step of aggression is the starting point of the second step of new aggression. In fact, before the task of occupying Korea was completed, the US imperialist aggressors and their puppets had already made plans for the next step. In 1949, Li Seung-man's draft "Korean-American Alliance" submitted to the US government stated in Article 7: "Both parties recognize and establish an understanding: If the liberation war (referring to the US aggressive war) must continue on the territory of Manchuria in response to the Chinese Communist aggression against Korea, the President of the United States of America will help the President of the Republic of Korea to carry out the liberation war to a victorious end. As a reward for this help, the President of the Republic of Korea guarantees to transfer the development of the natural resources of Manchuria and other parts of eastern China, where the main interests of the Republic of Korea lie, to the joint management of the United States and Korea." US war peddlers are constantly clamoring for US troops to cross northern Korea into our northeast. The popular US magazine—US News & World Report—published a bombing map of the invading Korean US troops in its October 13 issue, clearly marking our northeast cities as targets for the invading Korean US Air Force. On the third day of my arrival in New York, November 26, the New York Times published a letter from Yang Hengli, former representative of South Korea at MacArthur's headquarters, proposing the establishment of a buffer zone north of the Yalu River within Chinese territory. It is not accidental that the New York Times published such a letter. All of this indicates that the invading Korean US troops are plotting to invade our northeast in a planned manner.

    The US government's intention to expand the Korean War is more firmly manifested in the actions of the US troops invading Korea. The US armed forces invading Korea, its aircraft and warships began to constantly provoke our country as early as August 27. The US Air Force invading Korea, from August 27 to November 24, dispatched more than a thousand aircraft in total, invading our airspace, penetrating deep into our territory to carry out bombing, strafing, and reconnaissance more than 200 times, causing a large number of casualties among our people and serious damage to our property. In addition to this, US warships invading Taiwan and Korea illegally searched our peaceful merchant ships on the high seas. This series of aggressive actions by the US proves that the US government has decided to expand its aggression to China, and the US imperialists' acts of war of aggression against the People's Republic of China have already begun. Here I have a chart for the Chairman and everyone to view. This chart records the situation of US military aircraft invading Chinese airspace to carry out bombing, strafing, and reconnaissance, destroying Chinese property, and killing and injuring Chinese people from August 27 to 9:20 on November 10.

    Under the intolerable situation of US imperialism's long-term aggression against China, being enemies with the Chinese people everywhere, launching aggression against Taiwan and Korea at the same time, resolving to expand the Korean War, and constantly provoking China, it is completely natural, completely reasonable, and completely aboveboard for the Chinese people to rise up and volunteer to aid Korea and resist the US in order to defend their homes and country, and there is not the slightest thing for the war peddlers to make a fuss about.

    The US ruling group, according to a pre-determined plan, directed its puppet Li Seung-man to launch an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, provoking the Korean civil war, and using the excuse of interfering in the Korean civil war, simultaneously launched aggression against Taiwan and Korea; its aggression against our territory Taiwan is of course a blatant act of aggression, and there is no reason to explain it; its aggression against Korea is also an inexcusable act of aggression, and the reasons put forward by the US government to defend its aggression against Korea cannot withstand refutation. The US government is attempting to steal the cloak of the United Nations to cover up the truth of its armed intervention in Korea, but this effort is futile.

    Assuming that the Li Seung-man reactionary group had not only provoked the Korean civil war, but also gained the upper hand in the civil war, and had pushed the war into the heartland of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the beginning, we can believe that the US government would never have considered this to be an aggression by South Korea against North Korea, and would have demanded that the UN take so-called "anti-aggression" steps. However, what was unfavorable to the US ruling group was that after the Democratic People's Republic of Korea repelled the provocative attack of the Li Seung-man reactionary group, it immediately launched a counterattack and quickly pushed the war into the area ruled by the Li Seung-man reactionary group, so the US government shouted the completely absurd slogan of so-called North Korea invading South Korea, and immediately dispatched armed forces according to a pre-determined plan to carry out armed intervention in Korean internal affairs, armed aggression against the Korean people.

    To say that the armed forces of North Korea attacking the reactionary group of South Korea in the civil war is an aggression is the biggest lie in history; but the US government's armed aggression against Korea relies on this huge lie to cover it up. We want to ask the US representatives: In the 1860s, the US had a civil war, when President Lincoln led the armed forces of the northern states to attack the southern states; do the US representatives think that this was an aggression by the North against the South, and President Lincoln was the biggest aggressor who led this aggression? We also want to ask the US representatives: Not long ago, the Chinese people had the same experience. In 1946, the reactionary group of Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese Kuomintang destroyed domestic peace and launched a civil war against the Chinese liberated areas led by the Chinese Communist Party. In 1948, the Chinese people's armed forces launched a counterattack after repelling Chiang Kai-shek's attack and pushed the war into the areas ruled by the Kuomintang; do the US representatives think that this was an aggression by the Chinese People's Liberation Army against the reactionary group of the Chinese Kuomintang?

    The US ruling group can deny their own history, but freedom-loving people all over the world see the facts clearly. The counterattack by the armed forces of North Korea against the reactionary group of Li Seung-man in South Korea in the civil war is not an aggression in any sense. The real aggressor is the US government, the US ruling group, the US imperialists, who, under the pretext of opposing the so-called aggression of North Korea against South Korea, sent its armed forces to Korea to attack the Korean people. People all over the world are asking the US ruling group such a question: How can Koreans invade Koreans? Why did the US armed forces send troops to Korea, five thousand miles away, to attack Koreans who have never invaded the US? These questions are asked correctly; the Korean people cannot invade the Korean people, just as Americans cannot invade Americans, and the Koreans have never invaded the US or Americans. It is the US imperialist ruling group that interfered in the internal affairs of Korea and carried out armed aggression against Korea.

    The US ruling group is attempting to steal the name of the United Nations to cover up its interference in Korean internal affairs, but this practice is equally deceiving. The US representatives are accustomed to citing the UN Security Council resolutions of June 25, June 27, and July 7, which require UN member states to provide armed support to Li Seung-man's so-called Republic of Korea against the so-called aggression of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is said that this is the legal basis for the so-called UN forces to oppose North Korean aggression, but all these legal bases are fundamentally illegal, and violate the UN Charter both in form and in substance. The UN Charter clearly stipulates that the UN shall not interfere in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state. However, all the above-mentioned UN Security Council resolutions on the Korean issue seriously violated this principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and are therefore illegal. In terms of procedure, the passage of these Security Council resolutions was also illegal. The UN Charter clearly stipulates that any major resolution of the Security Council must be passed with the consent of seven votes, including the five permanent members, but these resolutions were passed without the participation and consent of the two major permanent members, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and are therefore in violation of the UN Charter and illegal. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has also long expressed its attitude, resolutely opposing these reactionary resolutions illegally passed by the UN Security Council under the manipulation of the US government. In fact, studying and analyzing the illegality of these resolutions is superfluous, because the fact is that on June 27, the US government first decided to carry out armed intervention in Korean internal affairs and made a solemn announcement to the world, and then ordered Mr. Austin to take this decision to the Security Council to have the Security Council pass it.

    Mr. Austin keeps saying that the UN forces are carrying out an anti-aggression war in Korea, but who can this deceive? What is currently waging war against the Korean people in Korea is not a UN force, but mainly the US army and some small number of foreign troops helping the US. The commander of this war is not a UN commander-in-chief, but General MacArthur, the commander-in-chief of the US Far East Command, who is hated by the people of Asia. The purpose of this army, which is fighting against the Korean people, is not anti-aggression at all, because the Korean people cannot invade the Korean people at all, nor is it to complete the independence and unification of Korea, because there has never been such a joke in the world that the independence and unification of a country must be forcibly completed by the armed forces of another or several countries. No, this US army, which is fighting against the Korean people, aims to conquer the whole of Korea and use Korea as a springboard to attack the Chinese mainland, and as I said above, it has already begun to attack the Chinese mainland.

    This US-Li army, which is fighting against the Korean people, violates all international laws and conventions, and massacres innocent peaceful residents, women, and children in Korea on a large scale, and barbarously destroys peaceful cities and villages in Korea. Its barbarity and cruelty are only surpassed, not equaled, by what the Hitler army did in Europe. The anger caused by the barbarous, cruel, and inhumane behavior of the US-Li army in Korea among the Korean people, the Chinese people, and peace-loving people all over the world is immeasurable. Here, I must point out that since as early as August 5 and until recently, November 27, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Park Heon-young, has been constantly lodging solemn protests with the UN about this, demanding that the UN stop the inhumane and brutal behavior of the US-Li army; but the UN has deliberately ignored this accusation and deliberately covered up these bloody records. But on the other hand, although the Korean People's Army is lenient towards prisoners of war who lay down their weapons, and the American people already know that the Korean People's Army has released hundreds of prisoners of war, the US ruling group's news reports are deliberately exaggerating the news of the deaths of US troops on the Korean battlefield in order to fool the American people and stimulate their retaliatory emotions, so as to create an excuse for the US-Li army to carry out greater massacres and destruction in Korea. This is shameful behavior. We cannot but lodge an angry protest against this. The reactionary view that only the lives of Anglo-Saxons are precious, and the lives of Asians are worthless, no longer works. The Chinese people will resolutely use the struggle of not fearing sacrifice to oppose this unprecedentedly barbarous, cruel, and inhumane behavior of the US-Li army.

    Distinguished representatives, this is the true content of the Korean issue. The US government carried out armed intervention in Korea, massacred the Korean people, attempted to conquer the whole of Korea, and attacked the Chinese mainland. I, on behalf of the Central People's

    中华人民共和国的声音是应该被全世界听到            
    伍修权在记者招待会分发庄严文件支持苏联代表控美侵略我国的发言
    【新华社十八日讯】纽约消息：中华人民共和国代表伍修权在十六日举行的记者招待会上曾分发一项文件，这一文件是伍代表准备在联合国第五届大会政治安全委员会的发言。这一文件题为《中华人民共和国代表伍修权支持苏联代表维辛斯基在联合国政治安全委员会控诉美国侵略中国的发言》，全文如下：
    我听了苏联代表维辛斯基先生在十一月二十七日政治安全委员会会议上控诉美国侵略中国的发言。我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全支持和维护苏联代表维辛斯基先生提出的控诉美国侵略中国的全部发言。苏联在历史上从来就是中国人民伟大的朋友，远在苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命成功之后不久，它就宣布废除沙皇俄国和中国所缔结的不平等条约，采取了真正的平等待我的政策。中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立之后，苏联又同我们缔结了真正友好的中苏友好同盟互助条约，用条约的形式把中苏两国人民的深厚友谊固定下来。维辛斯基先生的发言再一次证明了苏联是中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略、建设人民中国过程中的最可靠的朋友与盟邦。一切帝国主义侵略者，首先是美国帝国主义侵略者害怕中苏两国人民的团结，害怕反对帝国主义侵略与保卫中苏两国共同利益的中苏友好互助同盟。中苏团结了，帝国主义的侵略勾当就不好干了。中苏七万万人民坚固团结的力量，是帝国主义进行侵略最大的障碍。因此，在绝望当中，帝国主义侵略者们就想出各种办法来挑拨离间中苏两大盟邦之间的关系。但是，我要告诉这些帝国主义者，中苏两国的伟大团结是不可动摇的，你们这些挑拨离间的阴谋是徒劳的，注定要失败的，而且已经失败了。
    我也听了美国代表杜勒斯先生对于维辛斯基先生发言的答辩。杜勒斯先生对于维辛斯基先生的答辩，以及奥斯汀先生在安全理事会关于这一问题的发言和他对于我在安理会发言的答辩，还有英国代表杰伯先生对于美国代表的辩护——所有这些发言，答辩和辩护都是歪曲事实，颠倒是非，经不住驳斥的。他们说了一大堆话，但是不管他们说的是历史也好，是哲学也好，是政治或经济也好，他们总不能自圆其说，其根源就是因为他们坚持侵略，坚持为侵略辩护；他们要把侵略说成是防御，把反侵略说成侵略，把战争说成和平，把是说成非，把黑说成白，不管他们有多大本领，究竟是办不到的。就拿我们目前讨论的问题来说吧，他们能把一个摆在台湾海峡的庞然大物——侵略中国领土台湾的美国第七舰队说成是并不存在吗？他们能把美国成千架的飞机几百次地侵犯中国领空、轰炸、扫射、侦察的事实说成是并未发生过的事吗？不能的。
    不能这样做，也得这样做——这就是杜勒斯先生、奥斯汀先生和其他美英集团的代表们在这里的使命。
    杜勒斯先生装成悲天悯人的君子，一开头从中美两国人民的友谊说起。好，我们就来谈谈中美两国人民的友谊吧。中美两国人民之间是不是存在深厚的友谊呢？是的。我在到纽约时就已经说过：“中美两国人民之间从来就存在着深厚的友谊”；我现在还要强调说，中美两国人民之间不仅过去有过深厚的友谊，现在有着深厚的友谊，而且这个友谊将来也是要存在下去的。但是中美两国人民之间的友谊和杜勒斯、奥斯汀、艾奇逊、杜鲁门先生们所说的美国帝国主义侵略者对被侵略的中国人之间的所谓“友谊”是毫无相同之处的。杜勒斯先生和奥斯汀先生在他们的发言中花费了不小气力来证明美国帝国主义侵略者对于中国人民的所谓友谊的存在。据杜勒斯先生说，这种友谊主要的不是从美国对华的商业利益出发，而是从文化和人道的动机出发。据说一百五十年来，美国帝国主义者的对华关系都是如此。在历史上美国帝国主义对中国人民的所谓友谊究竟是怎样的，他们在中国所做的文化和人道的努力是些什么实际内容，他们在中国的朋友究竟是些什么人呢？
    美国帝国主义者和英国一样，也是最早运鸦片到中国来的鸦片贩子。一八三九年在广州查禁的鸦片，很多一部分是出于美国鸦片贩子手中。鸦片战争中美国海军统领基尔尼亲率舰队到中国海面声援英军。一八四四年七月又强迫满清政府与美国签订了望厦条约。最先创立了《治外法权》与《利益均沾》条款。望厦条约是中国满清政府与外国政府最早签订的不平等条约之一。在一八五三年到一八六零年英法联军侵略我国，进兵天津和北京时，美国军舰也参加行动，并乘机胁迫满清政府订立中美天津条约（一八五八年）取得限制中国关税及中国内河航行等项特权。
    一八六二年美国驻上海总领事指示美人华尔等与英人共同组织军队，帮助满清政府镇压中国人民的太平天国革命运动。
    一八七二年美国军队进攻朝鲜。一八七三年除进攻朝鲜外，则更与日本联合进攻台湾，一八七四年又与日本联合进攻朝鲜。
    一九零零年美国参加八国联军进攻中国，并在辛丑和约中和其他帝国主义共同取得在北京等地驻兵的特权。
    一九一七年九月美国务卿蓝辛与日本外相石井订立协定承认日本在华特权，一九一九年美国政府又在巴黎和会中承认日本继承德国在山东的特权。
    一九二二年至一九二四年美国政府以军火及贷款援助中国直系军阀曹锟、吴佩孚等进行内战。
    一九二五年“五卅”惨案中美国帝国主义者参加屠杀中国人民。
    一九二七年四月，美国政府为了压迫中国大革命，特别是为了促成蒋介石投降帝国主义，与英国联合炮击南京，造成“下关惨案”。
    一九三一年至一九三三年美国政府以贷款（其中一次为五千万美元），飞机和军事顾问援助蒋介石反动政府进攻中国共产党所领导的工农红军。
    在日本侵华期间美国政府以大量军事物资供给日本。据日本官方材料，一九三五年美国输入日本的军需物资占日本全部进口军需物资的百分之三十三点五，一九四零年三月更增为百分之三十八点五。美国输日的废铁至一九四一年底还占日本废铁输入总数百分之五十。
    在日本投降后美国政府积极侵略中国，企图代替日本统治中国，将中国变作美国的殖民地。一九四六年十一月四日美国政府与蒋介石订立了有名的侵略条约《中美友好通商航海条约》，攫取中国的经济主权、关税主权及沿海和内河航行权等。甚至某一位英国议员都称之为是对中国“从未见过的最野蛮的经济侵略”。
    在日本投降以后，美国政府以金钱军火武器物资及军事顾问帮助蒋介石发动大规模反人民的内战。从日本投降前后起至一九四八年六月止，据已知材料，美国政府给蒋介石的各项援助达六十万万美金以上。这就是美国政府对蒋介石的反人民内战所作的巨大投资。
    这一百五十年的历史证明美国帝国主义者是一贯侵略中国的，他们对于中国人民的所谓友谊，不过是侵略的别称；他们在中国所作的文化和人道的努力，实际上只是为了实现这种侵略的手段，他们在中国的朋友，从满清皇帝、曾国藩、李鸿章、袁世凯、吴佩孚、曹锟、直到为全中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石，都是帮他们进行侵略的助手。
    举世皆知，美国政府目前在中国最好的朋友是蒋介石。蒋介石是美国帝国主义最好的朋友，但蒋介石却是中国人民不共戴天的敌人。这不是正好证明美国帝国主义者从来就是中国人民的敌人的朋友，中国人民的敌人吗？
    杜勒斯先生和奥斯汀先生在这里宣扬历史上美国对华“门户开放”政策，并且认为这是美国统治集团对中国人民的友谊的最高表现，但究竟什么是所谓“门户开放”政策的内容呢？所谓“门户开放”就是中国的门户必需对美国帝国主义者和其他帝国主义者同样开放，就是美国帝国主义者反对其他帝国主义国家独占中国，其目的就是美国帝国主义者要和其他帝国主义者“分赃”侵略中国的利益，就是美国帝国主义者要和其他帝国主义者“均沾”剥削中国的“利益”，这难道不清楚吗？
    美国统治集团在中国办了许多文化、宗教和人道事业，也的确有过不少善良的美国人民听信过他们的欺骗宣传，参加了这些事业，但创办这些事业的实际目的和客观效果从总的方面说却是麻痹中国人民，使他们不要反抗美国的侵略。
    美国帝国主义者对中国人民的所谓“友谊”最好的说明是杜勒斯和奥斯汀先生在这里所宣扬的美国政府对中国的所谓援助。美国政府有没有“援助”中国呢？有的。但是美国政府所“援助”的却是中国人民的敌人，援助他们镇压中国人民，屠杀中国人民。奥斯汀先生说，在过去十三年中，美国政府甚至于所谓“援助”中国的款项每年平均达一万万美元。奥斯汀先生也说了，其实不止此数。战后，美国政府就用了大量的枪炮、炸弹、军火、飞机和舰艇援助了蒋介石政府进行内战。但是美国政府这种所谓“援助”的后果是什么呢？蒋介石用美国武器屠杀了几百万中国人民。我在这里有一本中国人民解放军从国民党反动军队手中所缴获的一部分美国武器照片集，请大家传阅，这就是美国帝国主义假手蒋介石屠杀中国人民的铁证。
    中美两国人民之间从来就存在深厚的友谊，但是美国帝国主义者对于中国和中国人民有的却只是侵略。中国人民对于美国帝国主义者和美国统治集团从来就没有什么友谊，有的却只是仇恨。这种仇恨是美国帝国主义侵略中国的政策的必然结果。由于美国帝国主义这种侵略中国的政策，已经走上了武装侵略中国的阶段，中美两国人民的友谊正遭受着被破坏的危机，但是悲天悯人的杜勒斯先生，是谁在破坏中美两国人民的友谊呢？不是什么第三者在破坏这种人民之间的友谊，破坏这种友谊的是美国政府，是美国统治集团，是美国帝国主义者，是美国政府武装侵略中国的政策和行为，是美国帝国主义者把美国的青年送到台湾海峡和中国领空与中国人民为敌的。难道曾经有过中国的舰队开到美国海峡准备同美国人民作战的吗？难道曾经有过中国飞机飞到美国领空轰炸美国的妇女和婴儿吗？难道提议考虑使用那罪恶的武器原子弹去毁灭中国人民朝鲜人民的不是美国总统杜鲁门吗？
    美国帝国主义对于中国的侵略现在已由历史上荫蔽迂回的形式转变为干脆露骨的武装侵略的形式。
    台湾确定不移地是中国领土不可分的一部分，中华人民共和国中央人民政府解放台湾乃是对于自己的领土行使主权，是严格的中国内政问题不容许任何外国政府干涉。但杜鲁门总统却公开地派遣了美国武装力量到台湾决心阻止我中国人民解放军解放台湾，这分明是美国帝国主义对中国领土干脆露骨的武装侵略，但是美国代表们和他们喽啰们却说台湾的地位“是过去属于日本的领土之一，其处理，如其他过去属于日本的领土一样，依然是一个国际关心的问题”。这些英美集团的代表们忘记了台湾在历史上一直是中国的领土不可分的一部分，台湾的居民是中国人，受着中国政府的管辖。只是到了一八九五年才被日本抢去的，它的处理不仅在开罗宣言和波茨坦公告中早已决定，而且在战后实现已经五年了。美国代表奥斯汀先生说美国侵略台湾是为了使该岛“在军事上中立化”。但根据联合国宪章与国际法规，没有任何理由可以用来作为美国政府干涉他国内政和侵略他国领土的理由。所谓美国武装力量侵入台湾是为了使台湾在军事上中立化的说法，正不知不觉地证明了美国对于台湾的侵略。杜勒斯先生说美国并未侵略台湾，因为据他说美国政府驻台湾的军事人员只有四十四人。杜勒斯先生以为这样就可证明美国并未侵略台湾；可是杜勒斯先生没有告诉我们美国第七舰队上一共有多少军事人员，这一个舰队现在究竟在什么地方。杜勒斯先生采取把“有”说成“无”的办法，来为美国侵略台湾辩护，但是杜勒斯先生的诡辩不能把侵略台湾的第七舰队说成没有。奥斯汀先生又采取另外一套手法，即并不否认美国第七舰队入侵台湾海峡的事实，但却企图有意否认台湾是中国的领土的条约与事实，并且公然敢于问我中华人民共和国中央人民政府究竟打算对台湾怎么办？中国人民决心从毫不知耻的美国侵略者手中解放台湾。我们决定这样做，我们有力量这样做。由此而产生的一切后果概由美国政府负责。奥斯汀先生企图利用联合国名义来使美国侵略台湾的非法行动合法化，多找几个帮凶来侵略台湾，但是我要告诉奥斯汀先生，美国政府操纵下的联合国的任何非法决议对中国人民没有一丝一毫的约束力量。中国人民不仅决心打垮它所面对着的主要侵略者，而且有决心打垮一切敢于侵略中国领土的侵略者。
    杜勒斯先生不敢否认侵略朝鲜的美国空军侵犯中国领空进行轰炸扫射和侦察活动的侵略事实，但是杜勒斯先生说，苏联代表团于十一月十五日提出的美机八十三次侵犯中国领空的行为，有六十一次是属于侦察性质。我们现在问一问杜勒斯先生，假定即便是侦察性质的侵略中国领空，就不算是侵略行为吗？假定中国飞机飞到纽约上空进行侦察，杜勒斯先生的反响如何？美国代表又说假如事实证明确有美国军用飞机侵略中国领空，轰炸中国城镇，杀伤中国人民的事实，美国政府愿意用一定数目的款项赔偿。你们看，美国代表们说得多么轻松呀！但是我要郑重地告诉美国代表们，中华人民共和国的国家主权不是你们的钱可以收买的。我还要告诉美国代表们，你们目前在这一个世界上碰到了很多麻烦，这一些麻烦的来源之一就是因为你们总是以为你们的钱可以收买任何国家的主权，但是你们忘记了中国现在是人民当权的国家，这个国家的主权不是你们的几文臭钱所能收买的；你们能够收买的只可能是像蒋介石当权的旧中国的主权。但是，对于你们不幸的是，这一个旧中国的统治集团，尽管得到了你们几十万万的收买费，终于被中国人民从中国大陆上赶走了。杜勒斯先生，这就是你们敌视中国人民的根源。
    奥斯汀先生说：“自从北京政府成立之后美国政府对于中国、对于朝鲜或在朝鲜的行动从来就不是侵略的。”但是满身藏着赃物的强盗，要装着进天堂的圣徒，究竟是不容易做到的。
    现在，我在这里提出如下的事实，根据这些事实，我控诉美国政府对于中国的干涉、侵略和敌对的行动。
    （一）美国政府积极援助台湾蒋介石反动残余集团进行挣扎，指使它对中国海岸进行封锁，对中国沿海城市进行轰炸。美国以军火武器及其他物资不断运往台湾，据不完全的统计，自今年一月至十月美国和加拿大政府给蒋介石反动残余集团的飞机数百架，坦克七百余辆，美国的军官则在台湾训练国民党的军队，以与中国人民作战。美国战争贩子前美国空军第十四航空司令陈纳德公开宣称：“为了用饥饿来绞杀共产党，封锁是必要的。”蒋介石反动残余集团用美国飞机轰炸中国沿海的城市则是举世皆知的事实；二月六日蒋介石用美国飞机对上海施行野蛮的轰炸，死伤千余人民，毁坏了大批房屋财产，这是中国人民所永远不能忘记的。美国政府除公开积极援助蒋介石反动残余集团进行挣扎外，还企图从内部来破坏中华人民共和国。美国政府的特务机关正在和国民党的特务机关勾结在一起，指挥特务匪徒进行各种破坏活动。据我国西南军政委员会的统计，西南各省重要土匪头子百分之六十是受过美蒋特务训练的。同一个陈纳德在最近，十一月十八日一期的月里尔杂志上还公开宣称：“一个军事援助中国反共游击队的计划是实际的，它花不了多少美国钱；它可以节省很多美国生命。”
    （二）美国政府用各种方法阻扰我中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表参加联合国及盟国对日委员会，而硬让中国人民公敌台湾国民党反动残余集团非法占据了我国席位。我国外交部周恩来部长，远自去年十一月十五日以来就不断要求联合国开除非法的国民党反动残余集团的代表。苏联与印度和其他一些国家的代表在联合国大会和安理会也不断提出同样的建议，但这些合理的要求和建议都被美国及其指挥下的仆从国家所否决了。这样，一直到现在，美国政府不仅容留了国民党反动残余集团的代表团在联合国，而且指使它的一群走狗攻击中华人民共和国的合法代表的合理控诉。
    （三）美国政府正在积极地武装日本法西斯势力。日本法西斯势力正在复活，不顾我国政府的多次抗议与警告，麦克阿瑟将军非法的释放了大批日本侵华的战犯。日本的陆军正在“警察后备队”的名义下被美国在日本的当局所重新建立，日本警察部队已有十二万五千名；日本海军也在被恢复中，日本的所谓“海上保安厅”现在已经拥有舰艇三百艘。美国政府正在打算与日单独媾和，以便于它独占日本。最近美国国务院在它给远东委员会关于对日和约的一个备忘录中，居然公开提出中国领土台湾的地位应由美英中苏会商决定；美国政府心目中的所谓对日本和约是个什么东西就可想而知了。美国政府对日本采取这样的政策，其目的毫无疑义地是在于把日本变成为美国帝国主义在东方进行侵略战争的军事基地。而且，美国政府已经利用这个军事基地——日本和日本法西斯军阀对中国领土台湾和中国邻邦朝鲜发动了武装侵略。
    （四）美国政府在太平洋上建立起一个庞大的军事基地网，这个基地网自阿拉斯加的美军基地开始，经过阿留申群岛、日本、琉球、朝鲜、台湾、菲律宾、越南，一直伸展到泰国。谁都可以看出，这一个基地网是对新中国采取包围的形势。麦克阿瑟曾经公开承认这一个基地网是以中国和苏联为其包围进攻的目标。
    美国政府同时对我国领土台湾和我国毗邻朝鲜的武装侵略，不仅是美国帝国主义一贯侵略中国的必然结果，而且是进一步全面进攻中华人民共和国的一个预定步骤。美国政府对台湾的侵略固然是要使台湾成为美国帝国主义进攻中国大陆的跳板，武装侵略朝鲜同样在使朝鲜成为美国帝国主义进攻中国大陆的跳板。
    美国政府的侵略朝鲜一开始就威胁着我国的安全；其后美国政府更不顾我国政府多次的警告，命令美国侵略朝鲜的军队把侵略战争的火焰执拗地延烧到我国东北边境。美国政府这样做的目的，不可能是别的，只可能是在完全侵占朝鲜以后，进一步侵略中国。无数历史的事实证明：侵略者第一步侵略所达到的终点就是第二步新侵略的起点。事实上不等到占领朝鲜的任务完成之前，美国帝国主义侵略者及其傀儡已经把下一步的计划做好了。一九四九年李承晚向美国政府提出的《韩美同盟》草案第七条就说：“双方承认并成立谅解：如果解放战争（按指美国的侵略战争）一定要在满洲领土上继续进行，以答复中国共产党对朝鲜的侵略，美利坚合众国总统阁下将帮助大韩民国总统阁下把解放战争进行到胜利的结束。作为这种帮助的酬答，大韩民国总统除了复兴大韩民国主要利益所在的北朝鲜以外，保证将满洲与中国东部其他部分之天然资源的开发移交美国和韩国共同管理。”美国战争贩子们不断叫嚣着主张美国军队越过朝鲜北部进入我国东北。美国流行的杂志——美国新闻与世界报导在它的十月十三日的一期上就刊载了一张侵朝美军的轰炸地图，分明地把我国东北城市标志出作为侵朝美国空军的对象。在我到纽约的第三天，十一月二十六日，纽约时报就刊载了前南朝鲜驻麦克阿瑟总部代表杨亨利君的一封读者来信，提议在鸭绿江以北中国领土内成立一个缓冲地带，纽约时报刊出这样的来信不可能是偶然的。所有这一切指明了，侵朝美军是在有计划地图谋侵略我国东北。
    美国政府扩大侵朝战争的意图更确定地表现在侵略朝鲜的美军的行动上。侵略朝鲜的美国武装力量，它的飞机和军舰远在八月二十七日起就开始不断地向我国挑衅。侵略朝鲜的美国空军，从八月二十七日起至十一月二十四日止，共出动飞机千架以上，侵略我国领空，深入我国境内进行轰炸、扫射与侦察达二百余次，造成我国人民大量的伤亡与我国财产的严重损害。除此而外，侵略台湾和朝鲜的美国军舰又在公海上非法盘查我国和平商船。美国这一连串的侵略行动证明了美国政府已经决心扩大侵略到中国，美国帝国主义者对于中华人民共和国侵略的战争的行为已经开始了。在这里我有一本图表请主席、各位传观，这一本图表记载了从八月二十七日起至十一月十日九时二十分止美国军用飞机侵略中国领空进行轰炸扫射和侦察，毁坏中国财产杀伤中国人民的情况。
    在美国帝国主义长期侵略中国，到处与中国人民为敌，同时发动了侵略台湾与朝鲜，决心扩大侵朝战争，不断向中国进行挑衅的一种忍无可忍的状况下，中国人民为了保家卫国，纷纷起而志愿援朝抗美，这是完全自然，完全合理，完全光明正大的事情，没有一丝一毫值得战争贩子们大惊小怪的。
    美国统治集团按照预定计划指使它的傀儡李承晚发动对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，挑起朝鲜的内战，又以干涉朝鲜内战为借口，同时发动了对台湾和朝鲜的侵略；它的侵略我国领土台湾固然是干脆露骨的侵略行为，没有任何道理可说；它的侵略朝鲜同样是不可饶恕的侵略行为，美国政府提出来为它侵略朝鲜辩护的理由是经不起一驳的。美国政府企图盗用联合国的外衣来掩盖它的武装干涉朝鲜的真相，但是这一种努力是徒劳的。
    假使李承晚反动集团不仅挑起了朝鲜内战，而且在内战中占了上风，一开始就把战争推进到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的腹地去，我们可以相信美国政府断不会认为这是南朝鲜对北朝鲜的侵略，从而要求联合国采取所谓“反侵略”的步骤。但是对于美国统治集团不利的是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在打退了李承晚反动集团的挑衅进攻后，立即转入反攻迅速地把战争推进到李承晚反动集团所统治的区域里去，于是美国政府就喊出了根本荒谬的所谓北朝鲜侵略南朝鲜的口号，并立即按照预定计划派遣武装力量进行对朝鲜内政的武装干涉，对朝鲜人民的武装侵略。
    说北朝鲜人民武装力量在内战中对南朝鲜反动集团的反攻是一种侵略，是历史上最大一次的撒谎；但美国政府对于朝鲜的武装侵略就是依靠这一个天大的撒谎来掩盖的，我们要问一问美国的代表们：在十九世纪六十年代美国曾经有一次内战，那时林肯总统曾经领导过北方诸州的武装力量进攻到南方诸州去；美国代表们是不是认为这就是北方向南方的侵略，林肯总统是领导这一个侵略的最大侵略者？我们还要问一问美国的代表：前不久中国人民有过同样的经验，一九四六年中国国民党蒋介石反动集团破坏了国内和平，向中国共产党所领导的中国解放区发动了内战，一九四八年中国人民武装在打退了蒋介石的进攻以后转入反攻，把战争推进到国民党统治的区域里去；美国的代表们是不是认为这就是中国人民解放军对中国国民党反动集团的侵略？
    美国统治集团可以不承认他们自己的历史，但全世界爱好自由的人民却是看得清楚事实的。北朝鲜人民武装力量在内战中对南朝鲜李承晚反动集团的反攻，在任何意义上都不是什么侵略。真正的侵略者是借口反对北朝鲜对南朝鲜的所谓侵略，把他的武装力量开到朝鲜去进攻朝鲜人民的美国政府，美国统治集团，美国帝国主义者。全世界的人民都在向美国统治集团提出这样的一个问题，朝鲜人怎样会侵略朝鲜人呢？美国的武装部队为什么派到五千英里以外的朝鲜，去进攻从来没有侵略过美国的朝鲜人呢？这些问题是提得对的；朝鲜人民不可能侵略朝鲜人，正如同美国人不可能侵略美国人一样，朝鲜人也从来没有侵略过美国和美国人，是美国帝国主义统治集团干涉了朝鲜的内政，武装侵略了朝鲜。
    美国统治集团企图盗用联合国的名义来掩盖它对于朝鲜内政的干涉，但是这个做法同样是骗不了人的。美国代表们惯于引用联合国安全理事会六月二十五日、六月二十七日和七月七日关于要求联合国会员国武装支持李承晚的所谓大韩民国反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的所谓侵略的决议，据说这是什么联合国军队反对北朝鲜侵略的法律根据，但是所有这些法律根据根本就是非法的，不管是在形式和实质上都是违反联合国宪章的。联合国宪章明确规定不得授权联合国干涉本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件。但是所有上述联合国安理会关于朝鲜问题的决议，都严重地破坏了这决不干涉他国内政的原则，从而是非法的。在程序上，这些安全理事会的决议的通过也是非法的，联合国宪章明确规定安全理事会任何重大决议，必须有包含五大常任理事国在内的七票同意才能通过，但这些决议都是在没有苏联和中华人民共和国两大常任理事国参加和同意的情况之下通过的，因此它是违反联合国宪章的，非法的。我中华人民共和国中央人民政府也早就表示了它的态度，坚决反对联合国安全理事会在美国政府操纵之下所非法通过的这些反动决议。其实研究分析这些决议的非法怕是多余的，因为事实是六月二十七日是美国政府先决定武装干涉朝鲜内政，并向全世界做了郑重的宣告，然后才命令奥斯汀先生把这个决定拿到安全理事会要安全理事会通过的。
    奥斯汀先生开口闭口说什么联合国军队在朝鲜进行什么反侵略战争，但这能骗到谁呢？目前在朝鲜对朝鲜人民进行战争的不是什么联合国军队而主要的是美国军队和其他一些少量帮助美国的外国军队。指挥这一个战争的也不是什么联合国总司令，而是亚洲人民所痛恨的美国远东军总司令，麦克阿瑟将军。这一个正在向朝鲜人民作战的军队，其目的根本不是什么反侵略，因为朝鲜人根本不可能侵略朝鲜人，也根本不是为了完成朝鲜的独立与统一，因为世界上从来就不可能有这样的笑话，一个国家的独立与统一要由另外一个或几个国家的武装力量去强制地完成。不是的，这一个正在向朝鲜人民作战的美国军队，其目的是征服全朝鲜，并以朝鲜为跳板进攻中国大陆，而且像我上边所说的它已经在开始进攻中国大陆。
    这个正在向朝鲜人民作战的美李军队，破坏一切国际法规和惯例，在朝鲜大量地屠杀朝鲜无辜的和平居民与妇女儿童，野蛮地破坏朝鲜的和平城市与乡村。其野蛮与残忍比起希特勒军队在欧洲所做过的，只有超过，没有不及。美李军队在朝鲜野蛮残忍与不人道的行为在朝鲜人民、中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民中间所引起的愤怒是不能衡量的。在这里，我得指出，远自八月五日起直至最近，十一月二十七日止，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交部部长朴宪永就不断向联合国对此提出严正的抗议，要求联合国制止美李军队的这种不人道的残暴行为；但联合国一直有意地对于这种控诉置之不理，有意地把这些血淋淋的记录掩盖起来。但另一方面，尽管朝鲜人民军对于放下武器的战俘是宽大的，美国人民都已知道，朝鲜人民军已经释放了好几百战俘，美国统治集团的新闻报道，却在有意地夸大煊染美军在朝鲜战场被打死的消息，来愚弄美国人民，刺激他们的报复情绪，好替美李军在朝鲜进行更大屠杀与破坏制造借口，这是可耻的行为。对此我们不能不提出愤怒的抗议。那种认为只有盎格鲁撒克逊人的生命宝贵，亚洲人的生命一钱不值的反动观点，已经行不通了，中国人民将坚决地用不惜牺牲的斗争来反对美李军这种空前野蛮残忍与不人道的行为。
    各位代表先生，这就是朝鲜问题的真实内容。美国政府武装干涉朝鲜，屠杀朝鲜人民，企图征服全部朝鲜，进攻中国大陆。我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府向联合国大会控诉美国政府武装侵略朝鲜，屠杀朝鲜人民，扩大朝鲜战争，威胁中国大陆的不法的罪恶的侵略行为。
    美国政府武装侵略台湾是一种没有任何道理的干脆露骨的侵略，美国政府武装侵略朝鲜在实质上同样是没有任何道理的一种不可饶恕的侵略。美国政府同时武装侵略了台湾和朝鲜，就更加证明了美国政府对于台湾和朝鲜的武装侵略实在是在实现一种早就安排好了的规模浩大的侵略计划。因此，只有这种同时威胁中朝两国人民的侵略才是属于一种不知羞耻的性质的侵略。
    美国总统杜鲁门，美国国务卿艾奇逊，美国代表奥斯汀一贯地采取这样的一条路线，就是用美国政府对于朝鲜的武装干涉，来证明美国政府武装侵略台湾的必要，甚而至于十一月份安理会主席贝勃勒先生也采取了这条路线，说什么美国政府侵略台湾的问题是次要的；从而支持了那种根本不讨论我国政府对于美国武装侵略台湾的控诉，或者是那种说待朝鲜问题解决了才能解决我国控诉美国武装侵略台湾的问题的意见。我要郑重指出，所有这些意见是荒谬的，维护美国侵略者的。联合国宪章明确地规定了任何理由都不能作为进行侵略的借口，美国政府对朝鲜进行武装干涉，根据什么可以作为美国武装侵略台湾的借口呢？美国代表企图以武装干涉朝鲜来为美国武装侵略台湾辩护的办法，是可笑的，骗不了人的，经不起一驳的。（⑴⑷）
    美国政府的侵略台湾和它的侵略朝鲜的确是有密切的关系，但是这两者之间的关系，不是美国政府的武装干涉朝鲜可以作为美国政府侵略台湾的理由，而是美国政府的侵略台湾和侵略朝鲜都是美国政府进攻中国大陆全套计划中的一部分。对于中国人民说起来，侵略了朝鲜，在朝鲜向朝鲜人民进行战争的那一批人，正是侵略台湾的同一伙侵略者。美国既然同时发动了对中国领土台湾和中国邻邦朝鲜的侵略，中国人民为什么不能在反对美国武装侵略台湾同时，在志愿的基础上援助朝鲜人民反对美国武装侵略朝鲜，我在安全理事会的会议上听到无数这样的空话，说什么目前在朝鲜打仗的部队，没有任何意图侵略中国的东北国境，而且据说联合国的安理会多数会员国家准备把这种保证写在决议案里，你们中国人民为什么还不放心呢？这简直是把中国人民当作白痴。值得注意的是这些愿意保证美国军队在朝鲜绝不侵略中国边境的国家，正是那些主张美国第七舰队留在台湾海峡继续侵略中国的国家。假使说有一个和美国敌对的外国，它的一支军队武装占领了夏威夷，它的另一支军队正在进攻美国的邻邦墨西哥，但这个侵略了美国夏威夷的外国侵略者却来向美国人民保证说：你们不要惊慌，我们在墨西哥的军队，绝不会侵略美国的领土。大家想一想，美国人民能相信这一个侵略者和它的助手们的保证吗？美国政府武装侵略中国领土台湾，他的武装力量正在另一个地方带着威胁接近着中国的边境，但美国政府和它的助手们却要中国人民相信它的保证，说这一支接近你们边境的武装力量，绝不会侵略你们那里的领土。中国人民斗争经验是太丰富了。对于这一文不值的废话，他们是连注意都不屑注意的。侵略台湾海峡的美国第七舰队和已经侵犯了中国领空达二百次以上的侵略朝鲜的美国空军驳倒了奥斯汀先生杰伯先生等所能提出的任何保证。美国第七舰队讲的话要比奥斯汀先生讲的话宏亮得多，雄辩得多。中国人民完全正确地了解了美国政府同时武装侵略台湾和侵略朝鲜，美国武装力量不断向中国挑衅的全部含义：侵略朝鲜的侵略者正是侵略台湾的侵略者，侵略朝鲜的侵略者一旦完成了对朝鲜的侵略，其下一步必然就是进一步侵略中国的大陆。只有中国和朝鲜有着五百公里的共同疆界。在历史上中朝两国人民的关系从来就是唇齿相依；今天侵略朝鲜的侵略者明天必然侵略中国。五十五年以前日本帝国主义曾经是这样做的，目前美国帝国主义者正在加速这样做。因此，反抗美国政府武装侵略台湾的中国人民，他们在志愿的基础上援助朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略的行动不仅是无可指摘的，而且是完全正义的；不仅是为了帮助自己的邻人，而且是为了保卫自己的国家。是美国帝国主义侵略者及其帮凶们侵略了台湾和朝鲜，志愿援助朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略的中国人民的行动是反干涉反侵略的义举。不管美国侵略者及其帮凶们怎样颠倒是非、欺瞒谎骗，干涉和侵略的暴行不停止，中朝两国人民反干涉、反侵略的正义斗争是不会停止的。我们可以设想这样荒谬的言论吗？美国帝国主义者可以跑到五千英里外去侵略朝鲜和台湾，中国人民不能志愿援助朝鲜人民反对那侵略了中朝两国的美国帝国主义的侵略和干涉吗？不可能设想的。美国侵略者的矛头伸得太长了，它竟伸过五千英里的太平洋，插进到中国与朝鲜的领土上。中朝两国人民坚决要求美国侵略者及其帮凶们收起它那侵略的长矛，同时从台湾朝鲜撤退它的一切武装力量。最近，由于美国麦克阿瑟将军所谓结束侵略朝鲜战争的最后一次攻势的破产，美国总统杜鲁门和美国国务卿艾奇逊先生和美国代表奥斯汀先生，就大叫什么中国对于朝鲜的所谓“新的侵略”或“干涉”，并且恫吓要再一次非法利用联合国的名义，把战争进一步扩大到中国大陆，不惜挑起第三次世界战争。各位代表先生，这是野蛮的恫吓；决心反抗美国侵略的中朝两国人民是不会在任何恐吓面前低头的。美国统治集团企图再一次盗用联合国名义把它的侵略朝鲜的战争，扩大到中国大陆。我们坚决反对联合国再一次被美国利用，因为这是彻底破坏联合国宪章；但是同时我要提醒所有支持美国这一策动的国家代表们，假如你们这样做，就是更进一步支持美国的侵略，与全中国四万七千五百万人民为敌，与全世界所有爱好和平反对战争的亿兆人民为敌，全中国和全世界人民不会宽恕你们，你们必须负起你们的行动所必然产生的后果。
    美国总统杜鲁门先生和美国国务卿艾奇逊先生不断提到目前国际形势中的“危机”。不错，目前国际形势中的确存在着“危机”；但是我们要问，这一危机的根源是在那里呢？这个危机的根源是美国帝国主义的侵略政策。美国少数帝国主义侵略者坚持扩大侵略，要求世界战争，因而产生了目前国际形势中的这个“危机”。怎样才能挽救目前的所谓“危机”，使国际形势好转呢？全世界人民反对战争。但是，和平不是可以用向侵略者让步的办法换取的，只有全世界一切爱好和平的国家与人民加强反对美国帝国主义的侵略，才是制止战争危机使目前国际形势好转唯一的办法。奥斯汀先生颠倒是非，说什么世界和平与战争问题取决于中国人民，好像是中国人民要到美国来轰炸，中国人民要向美国来投原子弹似的。不，奥斯汀先生，全世界的公是公非是不容颠倒的。摆在全世界人民面前的事实是美国少数帝国主义侵略者，违反美国人民和世界人民的愿望，坚持扩大侵略，决心要求战争，甚而至于恐吓着要使用原子弹。全世界人民所面对的问题是如何有效地反对这个扩大战争的阴谋制止这个帝国主义侵略者制造出来的战争危机。中国人民从他自身长期斗争的苦痛经验中深深知道只有寸步不让地制止美国帝国主义的侵略，世界战争才可以避免，世界和平才可以保持。中国人民决心这样做，任何威胁与欺骗都是无用的。
    中国人民完全有信心和决心从美国侵略者手中解放台湾，制止美国侵略者对于中华人民共和国一切直接与间接的侵略行为，但是为了维护世界和平与国际安全，为了维护联合国宪章的庄严，联合国对于美国政府武装侵略中国领土台湾和武装干涉中国邻邦朝鲜的侵略行为有义不容辞的制裁的责任。因此，我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府提请联合国大会通过如下决议：
    大会鉴于美国政府武装力量侵占台湾构成对中国领土公开直接侵略，复鉴于美国政府对中国领土的武装侵略及其对于朝鲜的武装干涉，破坏亚洲和平与安全违反联合国宪章与国际协定，要求安全理事会：
    （一）谴责并采取具体步骤严厉制裁美国政府武装侵略中国领土台湾和武装干涉朝鲜的罪行；
    （二）立即采取有效措施，使美国政府自台湾完全撤出它的武装侵略力量，以保证太平洋的与亚洲的和平与安全；
    （三）立即采取有效措施，使美国及其他外国军队一律撤出朝鲜，朝鲜内政由南北朝鲜人民自己解决，以和平处理朝鲜问题。
