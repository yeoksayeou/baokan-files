    "Voice of America" and the Voice of the American People
        Preface
    This is not poetry, but something expressing emotions from the bottom of the heart of a scientific worker. But I firmly believe that if it were in the hands of a poet, it would be handled very well. At the same time, I also firmly believe that music, dance, and vaudeville are more suitable tools for expressing this emotion. But unfortunately, I am only a scientific worker who knows nothing about them. What I regret even more is that time limits me and I cannot calmly ponder it.

           I. "Voice of America"
    From that distant shore of the Pacific,
    Through layers of smoke and haze,
    Emanates a thunderous cacophony,
    Like the throat of Goebbels. (Note 1)
    ★                            ★                            ★
    ——In my world's number one country,
    Great figures have emerged——
    James Morgan, (Note 2)
    Who crowned himself the master of all the stars in the universe.
    Launching wars of aggression,
    Slaughtering peaceful people,
    Breaking the world's record for cruelty.
    Whoever does not respect me, I will give him death!
    Whoever is close to me, I will give him gold!
    ★                            ★                            ★
    Gold, gold,
    Boundless magic.
    Ride in cars, live in mansions,
    Play with girls;
    Gold is yours,
    As long as you surrender.
    ★                            ★                            ★
    Our culture is also the world's number one,
    Thigh dance, unparalleled.
    Life is for enjoyment, what's wrong with being anesthetized?
    For the sake of human happiness, surrender quickly!
    I guarantee:
    You can always ride on the backs of the people!
    I guarantee:
    What you exploit can be deposited in my bank!
    I guarantee:
    We will definitely be your reliable godfathers and godmothers!
    ★                            ★                            ★
    What I want you to do:
    Small and trivial, easy and simple!
    The first thing,
    Throw your ancestral tablets into the toilet;
    The second thing,
    Just a piece of paper, writing three or five things:
    Sell out the soil, water, and air of your motherland;
    The third thing is even easier,
    Use your fleshy trumpet,
    Broadcast my "Voice of America" to every corner!
           II. The Voice of the American People
    The night is deep, the loudspeaker fails!
    From that same direction, the same country,
    Suddenly another kind of voice rises.
    Millions of voices mingling,
    Far less simple and sharp than "Voice of America."
    They have no megaphone,
    They have no broadcasting network,
    Relying solely on the throats their parents gave them,
    Telling of misfortune, expressing their innermost feelings.
    ★                            ★                            ★
    Life flows like a muddy river,
    Machines are eating our flesh and blood.
    Capitalists dance under mercury lamps,
    We worry about tomorrow.
    Our labor has created tall buildings,
    But we live in dilapidated houses;
    Our labor has created countless fats;
    The capitalists are already fat and plump,
    But we are on the verge of starvation all day long;
    Our labor has created fur clothing materials,
    The capitalists' families are adorned beautifully and charmingly,
    But on cold winter nights,
    We are still in rags.
    We are already tired of seeing the foreman's face,
    But tomorrow we still have to endure the torment,
    Who can spread the voice of us American people,
    To working compatriots all over the world.
    ★                            ★                            ★
    Lincoln freed us,
    But we still have nowhere to settle;
    Trains are segregated by black and white,
    Restaurants do not allow us to enter.
    Our occupations are limited to chores and sweeping,
    Our future is full of darkness and hardship.
    Klansmen (Note 3) are very fierce,
    In broad daylight,
    Lynch (Note 4) and torture us.
    We want to make this voice of the American people resonate throughout the world,
    Tell kind people:
    In the United States of America,
    White people bully black people.
    ★                            ★                            ★
    In those myriad different accusations,
    There is also the mournful sobbing of sorrow,
    They cannot loudly accuse,
    But they also have hatred that goes deep into their hearts.
    In their moments of triumph,
    They were also scolded by the laboring masses,
    As demons wearing animal skins.
    Regretting that for the sake of life's enjoyment,
    They sold their souls,
    Suffered the frivolity of the capitalists,
    In the end, they still belong to the oppressed group.
    ★                            ★                            ★
    Loving mothers,
    Kind wives,
    Have also issued resolute voices of resistance,
    Unwilling for their children, whom they raised with great effort,
    Unwilling for their loved ones, who are in their hearts,
    To waste their lives for the war profiteers.
    The mere Korean War,
    Has already swallowed up so many American lives!
    If the plans of the war profiteers come true,
    It will create millions of widows,
    It will pierce millions of loving mothers' hearts.
    The women of America,
    Shout from the bottom of their hearts,
    Is the voice of striving for peace.
    ★                            ★                            ★
    Listen carefully, recognize carefully;
    There are also sounds we are familiar with,
    "Easterners" in America,
    Have the same tragic fate as black people.
    Native Americans,
    Jews,
    Italians,
    Are also discriminated against and cannot turn over.
    Most pitiful are those on the capitalist front,
    Those who have been defeated,
    Yesterday they were still so radiant,
    Today they are already destitute.
    Big fish eats small fish, thin fish nurtures fat fish,
    Those who reside high above, are only sixty families (Note 5),
    They control the newspapers, magazines, and radios,
    Broadcasting the so-called "Voice of America."
    ★                            ★                            ★
    Any long night,
    Will always have a dawn;
    Any suffering people,
    Will always have a day to turn over.
    Millions of weak American voices,
    Will combine into a great voice,
    This voice will resonate across the earth,
    Overwhelming that "Voice of America" representing the sixty families.
    At that time,
    Please listen carefully,
    Another voice of America——the voice of the people.
    (Note 1) Nazi Germany's Minister of Propaganda.
    (Note 2) An American. He claimed that all the stars in the sky were his, and he requested the American court to file that "Everyone—except Americans, must obtain my consent to go to other planets." This request was actually approved. He also wrote to the League of Nations on this basis, requesting to join the League of Nations as the owner of the planets.
    (Note 3) The Ku Klux Klan is an American fascist terrorist organization.
    (Note 4) Lynching—White people often lynch black people to death without any legal procedures in disputes between white and black people. From 1882 to 1944, the officially announced number of victims was over 4,800.
    (Note 5) Sixty families—See F. Lundberg: America's Sixty Families.

    “美国之音”与美国人民的呼声
        代序
    这不是诗，而是一个科学工作者心底里的某种情感流露出来的东西。但我深信，如果在诗人手里，一定会处理得很好。同时我也深信，音乐、舞蹈、活报剧是更适合表现这种情感的工具。但可惜我仅是一个他无所知的科学工作者。更抱憾的是时间限制了我，不能从容地琢磨一番。

           一、“美国之音”
    从那遥远的太平洋的彼岸，
    透过了重重的烟幛，
    发出轰雷般的嘈音，
    好像是戈培尔（注一）的喉腔。
    ★                            ★                            ★
    ——在我这世界第一的国度里，
    产生过伟大的人物——
    詹姆士摩根，（注二）
    他自封为宇宙间一切星星的主人。
    发动侵略战争，
    屠杀和平人民，
    打破了世界上残酷的纪录。
    谁不尊崇我，我就给他死亡！
    谁亲近我，我就给他金洋！
    ★                            ★                            ★
    金洋金洋，
    魔力无疆。
    坐汽车，住洋房，
    玩弄姑娘；
    金洋包你有，
    只要你投降。
    ★                            ★                            ★
    我们的文化，也是世界第一，
    大腿戏，世无双。
    人生行乐耳，麻醉又何妨，
    为求人间乐，你们快投降！
    我保证：
    你能永远骑在人民的身上！
    我保证：
    你剥削所得的，能够存入我的银行！
    我保证：
    我们一定做你的可靠的干爹干娘！
    ★                            ★                            ★
    我所要你们做的：
    小而又小，易之又易！
    第一件，
    把你的祖宗牌位甩进厕所里；
    第二件，
    区区一张纸，上写三五事：
    出卖你祖国的土、水和空气；
    第三件更容易，
    用你的肉喇叭，
    把我这“美国之音”转播到每一个角落里！
           二、美国人民的呼声
    夜深沉，喇叭失灵！
    从那同一的方向，同一的国度里，
    忽然兴起了另外一种声音。
    千百万个混淆着，
    远不如“美国之音”单纯而尖锐。
    他们没有传声筒，
    他们没有广播网，
    全凭着爹娘生的歌喉，
    诉说不幸，吐露衷肠。
    ★                            ★                            ★
    生活像泥河一样流，
    机器在吃我们的血肉。
    资本家在水银灯下歌舞，
    我们在为着明天而发愁。
    我们的劳动，创造了高楼大厦，
    但我们所住的是破屋陋巷；
    我们的劳动，创造出无数脂肪；
    资本家们已吃得肥肥胖胖，
    但我们整日价在饥饿线上；
    我们的劳动，创造出皮毛衣料，
    资本家的眷属们，装饰得漂亮妖娇，
    但在寒冷的冬夜里，
    我们还是破衣烂帽。
    我们已经厌看那工头的面貌，
    但明天我们还得去忍受煎熬，
    谁能把我们这美国人民的呼声，
    传播给全世界劳动同胞。
    ★                            ★                            ★
    林肯解放了我们，
    但我们还是无处安身；
    火车黑白分座，
    餐馆不许我们上门。
    我们的职业限定了是打杂扫地，
    我们的前途，充满了黑暗艰辛。
    三Ｋ党徒（注三），十分凶狠，
    光天化日之下，
    私刑（注四）残害我们。
    我们要使这美国人民的呼声响彻世界，
    告诉善良的人们：
    在美洲合众国里，
    白人把黑人欺凌。
    ★                            ★                            ★
    在那万种不同的控诉里，
    还有那幽怨的啜泣的悲音，
    她们不能高声地控告，
    但她们也有那深入心底的仇恨。
    在她们得意的时候，
    也曾被劳苦大众，
    指骂为披了兽皮的妖精。
    悔不该为了生活享受，
    出卖了自己的灵魂，
    受尽了资本家的轻薄，
    到头来，还是属于被压迫的一群。
    ★                            ★                            ★
    慈爱的母亲们，
    善良的妻子们，
    也都发出了坚决反抗的呼声，
    不愿意她们辛苦抚养大的儿女，
    不愿意她们心坎上的爱人，
    替战贩们枉送性命。
    区区的朝鲜战争，
    已经吞没了多少条美国人的性命！
    如果战贩们的计划成真，
    将造成千百万个寡妇，
    将洞穿千百万颗慈母的心。
    美国的妇女们，
    从心底里发出吼声，
    就是争取和平的呼声。
    ★                            ★                            ★
    细细听，细细认；
    还有我们所熟悉的声音，
    “东方人”在美国，
    和黑人有相同的悲惨的命运。
    印第安人，
    犹太人，
    意大利人，
    也都遭歧视，不得翻身。
    最可怜在资本主义阵线上，
    斗败了的人们，
    昨天还是那么焕赫，
    今朝已是赤贫。
    大吃小，瘦养肥，
    高高居上，仅有六十家门（注五），
    他们掌握了报章杂志无线电，
    播送出所谓“美国之音”。
    ★                            ★                            ★
    任何漫长的夜晚，
    总会有个黎明；
    任何苦难的人民，
    总会有朝翻身。
    千千万万个微弱的美国之音，
    将结合成伟大的呼声，
    这呼声将响彻大地，
    压倒那代表六十家的“美国之音”。
    那时节，
    请倾耳细听，
    另一种美国之音——人民之音。
    （注一）纳粹德国宣传部长。
    （注二）一个美国人。他声称天上所有的星球都是他的，他向美国法庭请求备案说：“所有的人——美国人除外，要到别的星球去，必须得到我的同意。”这个请求，竟被批准。他并曾因此致书国际联盟，以各星球主人的身分要求加入国际联盟。
    （注三）三Ｋ党是美国的一个法西斯恐怖组织。
    （注四）私刑——白人对黑白人之间的纠纷，常常不经过任何法律手续，私行聚众将黑人吊打处死。由一八八二到一九四四官方公布的受害者的数字就有四千八百人以上。
    （注五）六十家——见Ｆ·龙伯客：美国六十家属。
