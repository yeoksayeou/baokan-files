Xinhua News Agency, 1st. This agency’s reporter with the Chinese People’s Anti-American and Aid-Korea Volunteer Army reports from the Korean front: The American aggressor troops, who suffered defeat in northern Korea from October 24th to November 8th, unwilling to accept the lessons of this defeat and disregarding the strength of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, once again gathered all the forces they could deploy on the Korean battlefield and launched a so-called general offensive on November 24th, attempting to realize their delusional plan to forever destroy all of Korea and further attack China. According to prisoner confessions: Participating in this offensive, on the Western Front, were the U.S. aggressor army's 1st Cavalry Division, 2nd Infantry Division, 24th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, British and Australian 27th Brigade, Turkish Brigade, the remnants of the First, Seventh, Eighth and Sixth Divisions of the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army, totaling 180,000 men. On the Eastern Front were the U.S. aggressor army's 1st Marine Division, 3rd Infantry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and the 3rd Division of the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army, totaling 80 to 90,000 men. The entire comrades of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, witnessing this frenzied act of aggression by the enemy, were filled with righteous indignation and vowed to annihilate the enemy with the greatest determination. They launched a counteroffensive on November 25th. After several days of fierce fighting, the enemy's offensive has been crushed. Now, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Western Front, with the force of an avalanche, are crossing high mountains and great rivers, advancing rapidly, and pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy. They have already recovered the cities of Bochuan, Ningbian, Qiuchang, Dechuan, Ningyuan, and Mengshan, and the offensive is developing. On the Eastern Front, the entire 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Army, parts of the 3rd and 7th Infantry Divisions, and part of the 3rd Division of Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee)'s army, which had advanced from Hamhung towards the Changjin area, have been surrounded by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army between Hamhung and Changjin, and are currently being annihilated.
