How the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Society Embarked on the Path of Correct Development?
Wang Chun

I. Checking Work by Combining Rectification and Studying Documents

Since the National Conference of Representatives of Cooperative Workers, all units of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Society have studied the policies and business of cooperatives in conjunction with the rectification movement and checked their work.

In the past year or so, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Society has developed a total of 386 various cooperatives with 452,811 members (statistics as of the end of September). They have played a considerable role in guaranteeing the lives of workers and staff, cooperating with state-owned trading companies to stabilize commodity prices, supplying rural cooperatives with means of livelihood and production, and purchasing and supporting agricultural and sideline products. However, due to insufficient understanding of the nature, tasks, and policies of the cooperatives, capitalist management ideas once existed. As a result, some businesses did not proceed entirely from the needs of the members, but rather from how much money they could make. Things that were originally very beneficial to the masses were not actively operated because they did not generate much profit. When making the 1950 supply and marketing plan, it was not based on the needs of the members, but on the amount of the general office staff's expenses. Due to the simple calculation of expenses, there were break-even and profit-making viewpoints in the business, believing that earning money was also for the service of the members, and that with the expansion of funds, the cooperative could better serve the members. Therefore, in business, they did not try their best to meet the needs of the members, but found reasons to do business with non-members, dispersing the cooperative's operating power and confusing the service targets. There was also a wrong view of the economic accounting system, that is, believing that the accounting system is just about making more money. They did not realize that the economic accounting system is to expand sales, save all kinds of expenses, reduce damage to goods, and reduce costs as much as possible to enable members to obtain relatively cheap goods from the perspective of actively meeting the needs of the members. The reason for these deviations is that there is a capitalist accumulation of funds viewpoint in the leadership work. They do not know how to avoid intermediate exploitation and carry out reasonable accumulation of funds in enterprise-oriented management.

II. Rectifying Business, Overcoming the Profit-Making Mentality, Facing the Grassroots Societies, Facing the Members

Based on the above inspection, the main shortcoming in our work is the deviation of the capitalist line. Therefore, in the rectification work, we first started with business rectification. In the rectification of business, we must focus on serving the members, meeting the needs of the members, and overcoming the profit-making mentality in operation. Our specific approach is as follows:

First, implement the policy of upper-level societies serving lower-level societies, and grassroots societies serving members. The Cooperative Law stipulates that "Cooperatives should concentrate all their efforts to meet the needs of their members." The general office first canceled retail sales and market wholesale work, and concentrated all its efforts to serve the grassroots societies. From August to October, non-member trade accounted for only 4.3% of the total sales, of which the non-member portion was mainly the supply of oil and salt to government agencies and troops, and the handling of some old grain and unpopular goods. After canceling trade with non-members and facing the grassroots societies, the sales volume not only did not decrease, but increased month by month. The analysis of sales volume and sales targets from July to October is as follows:

Sales Targets	Grassroots Societies	Non-Grassroots Societies	Total Amount	Monthly Sales Volume	Increase/Decrease Index
July	89.34 million	75.28%	28.9 billion	24.5%	118.3 million	100.0
August	101.6 million	90.0%	11.7 billion	10.0%	113.3 million	95.7
September	115.8 million	94.2%	7.1 billion	5.8%	122.9 million	103.9
October	146.5 million	95.7%	6.6 billion	4.3%	153.1 million	128.4

In addition, the number of commodities was reduced from 1,031 to 700, and recently another 200 kinds of unnecessary commodities and commodities with too many brands will be reduced. In this way, the financial resources are concentrated on the main commodities needed by the members, which can save 65 staff members and strengthen the work of the purchasing, transportation, and accounting departments. At the same time, the relationship between the grassroots societies and the general office is also closer. A cadre of a grassroots society said: "This time, the general office's transformation in policy is very good. If the general office does not change, not only will the general office collapse, but we will have to follow suit."

Second, according to the needs of the members, take the initiative to implement the allocation of daily necessities with fixed time, quantity, quality, and price (relatively low), and purchase agricultural products from members in rural supply and marketing cooperatives.

In the past, our business operations were relatively blind and unplanned. We did not know what the members needed; the members did not know what we had, and we mostly purchased based on subjective wishes and market conditions. We could not purchase according to the needs of the members, let alone meet the needs of the members. In order to understand the needs of the members, we conducted a typical survey of the economic situation of workers, farmers, and students.

According to the survey of the living needs of 59 worker members in the city, the average monthly expenditure per person is 75,898 yuan (calculated at the price of August 15), of which grain is 30.61 jin, totaling 34,263.5 yuan; non-staple food is 27,035.5 yuan (including peanut oil and sesame oil totaling 0.94 jin, salt 0.5 jin, alkali 0.5 jin, soy sauce 1 jin); daily necessities are 7,062.9 yuan (including cigarettes, matches, soap, toothbrushes, socks, towels, etc.); coal balls are 76.33 jin, firewood is 5.24 jin, totaling 7,536.1 yuan. Because workers have different incomes, the consumption is also different.

For farmers, daily necessities are mainly salt, cloth, cotton, kerosene, matches, needles and thread, coal, etc. In spring, they need grain, seeds, fertilizer, and insecticides and other means of production. Each farmer purchases an average of about 8.5 chi of foreign cloth and 0.5 jin of cotton (mainly for replenishment) per year. An average lamp needs 0.5 jin of lamp oil per month. One person needs 20 jin of salt a year, because farmers in the suburbs generally make their own sauce, with the more making 3 dou (20 jin of beans per dou) and the less making 1 dou. Each dou needs 10 jin to 15 jin of salt. Each household pickles 100 jin of vegetables, needing 20 jin of salt, and uses 1.5 packs of matches a month. This is the general need for daily necessities. According to the stationery consumption of primary school students in the rural suburbs, each primary school student needs 2 pencils, 3 large copybooks, 0.5 composition books, and 2 sheets of newsprint per month, totaling 2,000 yuan.

Based on these basic needs, we are trying to allocate several major daily necessities with fixed quantity, time, and price, starting from the suburbs (it has also been carried out in the city, such as the allocation of rice, apples, cabbage, potatoes, and sugar). For example, in the first week, the suburban cooperatives allocated 125,653 jin of rice, 178,425 jin of salt, 9,990 chi of cloth scraps, and 13,149 jin of cotton, with a total value of 45.678 million yuan, which was 7.321 million yuan cheaper than the market price, and 45,989 members enjoyed quantitative and cheap materials.

Since September to November 15, a total of 5.3 billion yuan of various materials have been allocated in two and a half months. At the same time, combined with the supply of necessities to members, we have carried out the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, and the cooperatives have organized saltpeter boiling in disaster areas, and 400,000 jin have been purchased.

Third, implement on-site procurement, mine and factory ordering, self-processing, careful calculation, and cost reduction.

In order to ensure the supply of relatively cheap materials, in addition to the state's preferential treatment, it is necessary to improve the operation of the society. Actively finding ways to reduce the cost of goods is a very important link.

1. On-site procurement. For example, after buying rice from Changsha for the first time, the market wholesale price was 1,250 yuan, while we sold it to the members for only 1,170 yuan per jin.
2. Mine and factory ordering. The cost of buying salt directly from the salt flats is 88.157 yuan, and selling it to the members is 950 yuan per jin, which is 15.6% cheaper than the market. We also directly signed contracts with the Municipal Enterprise Corporation for the supply of matches and paper. In this way, the source of goods is guaranteed, and the factory also has relatively fixed customers, so that producers are quickly, directly, and systematically united with consumers, promoting the improvement of quality. For example, the Xiangfeng Matches of the Municipal Enterprise Corporation had poor quality because it was privately operated for a period of time, and it was easy to set off and could not be lit. We guaranteed to the members that if there were the above shortcomings, we would replace them; the Enterprise Corporation also made the same guarantee to us. In this way, the goods are easy to gain faith in the masses.
3. Self-processing can not only ensure quality but also reduce costs. For example, each bag of flour is 780 yuan cheaper than the preferential price of the Trading Company, and the difference of 7.8 million yuan can be made by processing 100,000 bags per month. Each pair of winter thick socks made by ourselves costs 2,270 yuan, while the market price is 2,940 yuan. Each piece of alkali block costs 320 yuan when processed by ourselves, while private traders wholesale it for 360 yuan or 380 yuan. Running our own processing or processing plants is a very important link in reducing costs.
4. Careful calculation and cost reduction. In the past, we were not careful enough in calculation, so the cost of goods could not be seriously reduced. For example, before the installation of the drying machine for flour processing, only 73 jin of flour were handed over for every 100 jin of wheat. After the installation of the drying machine, 74 jin of flour were handed over for every 100 jin; 6.8 million jin of wheat were processed throughout the month, and 68,000 jin of flour could be handed over more. Another example is that if the transportation link is planned well, the goods can be directly transported to the grassroots society without unloading and warehousing, saving 11 liang of corn per bag of grain. One truck (30 tons) of salt transported by Shijingshan District directly to the grassroots society from the station saves 10 jin of millet in transportation costs per ton, and 2,000 yuan in warehousing fees, totaling 300 jin of millet, equivalent to 120,000 yuan. Each jin of salt reduces the cost by 7.2 yuan. The general office transported 10 trucks of wheat back from Henan and directly transported them to the processing plant, saving 3.98 million yuan in transportation costs in the middle.

Therefore, to correct the capitalist management thinking, we must strengthen the economic accounting thinking. With correct calculation, we can have reasonable management.

Fourth, correctly grasp the price policy and stipulate a reasonable profit rate.

The grasp of price policy is very important. The correct grasp of price policy is the watershed between capitalist and semi-socialist management, and it is also the concentrated expression of reasonable management. According to what principles should the cooperative stipulate prices? We adopt the original price plus freight, interest, damage, packaging depreciation fee, stamp tax, plus 2% profit (this is the maximum) as the wholesale price. For orders from local factories, direct pickup of goods does not add profit or only adds interest. The gross profit of grassroots societies shall not exceed 7%. The general office's wholesale of allocated goods to grassroots societies shall be at a uniform price, neither high nor low, which not only prevents the profit-making mentality of individual cooperatives from raising prices, but also guarantees the reasonable profit of the cooperative. At present, some cooperatives have a situation where they are buying and selling at cost, and some are even selling at a loss; this is a deviation from the insufficient understanding of long-term interests and reasonable capital accumulation. But the main deviation is still the profit-making mentality.

We believe that the stipulation of prices is not only a matter of market conditions and purchasing personnel, but also a concrete manifestation of implementing national policies and serving members, so the person in charge must personally review and grasp it.

III. Main Gains and Experiences

I. Beginning to overcome blindness, initially developing towards planning, and accelerating the turnover of funds.

Canceling non-member transactions and implementing quantitative supply is the fundamental key to moving towards planning. As the cadres of the grassroots society said in their review, "If non-member transactions are carried out, the customers are not fixed. They will not come when prices are stable, but they will come when there is a slight profit to be made, so it is difficult to grasp." It is not enough to just cancel non-member transactions. It is necessary to implement quantitative supply of several major items to the members. If the members are allowed to buy things that exceed their needs, the cooperative's plan will also be destroyed.

In this way, a business plan can be formulated according to the quantitative supply of members. According to this business plan, a transportation plan can be determined. Before the goods arrive, each grassroots society should be notified of the quantity and price to be distributed. Some cooperatives make needs statistics in advance and prepare furniture (such as small buckets for storing kerosene). When the goods arrive at the station, they are directly taken away to avoid the trouble of warehousing and save on freight. For example, Shijingshan District directly takes salt from the station, saving 436,500 yuan in miscellaneous transportation fees. After transportation, it is directly distributed. In this way, kerosene transported from Tianjin can be distributed in seven days, turning the funds back. The members prepare the funds in advance according to the price and the quantity they should buy, which further accelerates the turnover of funds and overcomes the contradiction between buying too much and selling too little or selling too much and having no goods. Making the business begin to develop systematically from top to bottom and from bottom to top.

II. Clearly defining the service targets, members get direct benefits.

Members do not welcome doing business with non-members. Many members said: "Those who do not join the society can also buy things, who else will join the cooperative? If the cooperative does business with non-members, they will buy them first if there is a slight discount. The members can't touch them; the cadres only want to make money, and they don't have the time and energy to take care of the needs and interests of the members." The members of Yaobian Village in the northern suburbs criticized the cadres of the village society, saying: "The cooperative buys grain from non-members. When we go to the cooperative to sell grain, the cooperative has no money. This is unreasonable and should take care of the members first!"

Quantitative and cheap distribution enables the vast number of members to obtain direct benefits. For example, in the suburbs, within seven days, materials worth 45,678,740 yuan were directly distributed to 45,989 members, avoiding 73,210,260 yuan of intermediate exploitation. In this way, the members care about their due interests, and non-members also actively ask to join the cooperative.

III. Consolidating and expanding the organization of the cooperative.

After quantitative distribution, the members get direct benefits, and those who want to withdraw their shares no longer do so, and those who have withdrawn their shares ask to rejoin. For example, in the cooperative of Gucheng Yamenkou in Shijingshan District, some members withdrew their shares and carried corn to the cooperative to ask to join. The villagers of Jinding Mountain Village originally participated in the Beixin'an Village Society. This spring, the village chief planned to establish a cooperative in the village and asked the villagers to withdraw their shares; the cooperative was not established, and the villagers went to Beixin'an to sell peanuts. Because non-members were not accepted, they complained about the village chief and asked to rejoin. Those with few shares actively increased their shares, and those who did not subscribe actively asked to join the society. Landlords and rich peasants also asked to join the society (because non-member transactions were canceled and they could not buy things). The "honorary members" who subscribed but did not pay the shares also actively paid the shares. In the distribution of Gou Nihe Village Society, 271 people paid the shares, and 30 new shares were added. From late October to early November, the rural supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs added 4,598 new members, accounting for 6.1% of the original members in the suburbs, and increased the shares of 22,990 jin of rice, accounting for 5.4% of the original shares.

IV. Developing the democracy of the cooperative and strengthening the relationship between the members and the cooperative.

In this distribution, the general cooperatives convened board meetings, representative meetings, or member meetings to publicize and discuss the cooperative's policies. Many members criticized that doing non-member transactions was wrong, and the cadres' service attitude towards the members was not good. For example, the member representative of Xihongmen said: "In the past, when agricultural loans were issued, the cadres did not hold meetings and did not do it fairly. We will come to the meetings if they are not held in the future." A member of Jiugong Village said: "This time the cooperative is better than before. It is both benefiting the members and letting everyone discuss. How good!" Chen, an old woman in Suoluo Ying, Eastern Suburbs, found the cooperative and said: "We are all members. Why didn't I get my share of cloth scraps?" The members began to feel interested in the cooperative and made new demands in the distribution, saying that there should be thimbles when there are needles. They also asked for shoe upper cloth, face cream, short socks, printed cloth, etc. Some members suggested that if kerosene exceeds 8,000 yuan per jin, the cooperative should prepare peanut oil for lighting.

The cooperative should care about the needs of female and child members and the things that the members need most urgently. The needles distributed this time were very popular among the female members, and it played a great role in mobilizing female members. An old lady in Guanzhuang, northern suburbs, carried corn to subscribe for shares and first asked if there were any needles for his distribution. An old lady in Heita Village, western suburbs, carried corn to the cooperative to subscribe for shares and first asked if the cotton was coming. If it came, she would subscribe for shares, otherwise she would not. In addition, the cooperative should also pay attention to the needs of children. Twenty-one students in Guanzhuang Elementary School ordered 118 notebooks, 12 pencils, and 2 brushes. Some elementary school students' parents did not join the society. In order to buy notebooks, the elementary school students pulled their grandmothers to join the cooperative. Therefore, paying attention to the needs of women and children often plays a great role in guiding the broad masses to participate in the cooperative.

IV. Several Problems to be Solved

I. Most of the cadres still do not have enough understanding of serving the members and overcoming the capitalist management deviation. They do not actively meet the requirements of the existing members, but are obsessed with non-member transactions, trying to simply make up for the non-member trade volume by expanding the number of members.

Some cadres regard quantitative and cheap distribution as a general business method, and do not realize that this is the distribution and management policy of semi-socialist cooperatives, and it is an effective method to prevent and overcome the capitalist line and blind management to achieve planned management and ensure the interests of the members.

Some cadres do not have enough understanding of the quota, and do not know that the so-called quantitative and cheap distribution is to actively and systematically ensure the needs of the members for major items.

Some cooperatives have not combined well with the guidance work, and have not carried out the method of cheap and quantitative timing, but the method of long-term selling, so the education effect on the members is not great. In general, the guidance of the group cannot keep up with the business, and the business cannot keep up with the needs of the masses. Under the active satisfaction of the needs of the members, the propaganda and education work and the member organization work should be strengthened, especially the propaganda of the Cooperative Law is more important. We should always be vigilant about the development of the capitalist line in the cooperative, because the cooperative itself still contains elements that produce capitalism. The correct embodiment of the cooperative line is the struggle and unity of the two lines.

II. The problem of poor members joining the society. There are many poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas and relatively difficult workers and staff in cities. There are many people in the family and few people participating in the cooperative. In this way, after distribution according to the members, the non-members cannot enjoy the rights, and the whole family cannot afford to pay the shares all at once, which is very embarrassing. In this case, the board of directors should discuss and decide to allow poor people to join the society, and the shares can be paid in installments, otherwise the vast number of working people will be shut out of the cooperative.

III. Should the distribution be based on households or members? The basic principle should be distribution based on members, but seasonal goods and goods planned by household should take care of the needs of the household. For example, in the season of pickling vegetables, the distribution by person is not good, some households pickle more vegetables and some households pickle less. Fertilizers are determined according to land and needs, so the seasonal needs should be appropriately taken care of, and the distribution volume should be appropriately increased, or two prices should be adopted. In addition to those who should be distributed, those who want to use more can go to the cooperative to buy, but the price can be higher. This is how it is currently implemented.

IV. The problem of material sources. Several major materials should be guaranteed frequently in order for the cooperative to develop and consolidate. Therefore, we must rely on state-owned enterprises and upper-level societies, and the state should formulate reasonable preferential treatment through the sales of cooperatives. Without the support of the state, the cooperative cannot develop and consolidate. New preferential measures should be announced as soon as possible. At the same time, we must combine the purchase and sale of agricultural products or sideline products to increase the purchasing power of the masses, unblock the materials between urban and rural areas, and prevent the cooperative's business from stagnating.

    北京市供销合作总社怎样走上了正确发展的道路？
    王纯
    一、结合整风学习文件检查工作
    全国合作社工作者代表会议以后，北京市供销合作总社各单位结合整风运动进行了关于合作社的政策和业务的学习，并检查了工作。
    一年多来，北京市供销合作总社共发展了各类合作社三八六个，社员四五二、八一一人（九月末统计数），对于保证职工生活，配合国营贸易公司稳定货价，供应农村合作社的生活、生产资料，收购和扶植农副产品，都起了相当作用。但由于对合作社的性质、任务、方针认识不够明确，曾存在着资本主义经营思想，因之有些业务没有完全从社员需要出发，而是先从赚钱多少出发。本来对群众很有利的事，因为赚钱不多，就不积极去经营。在作一九五○年度供销计划时，不是从社员需要出发，而是以总社人员开支多少为业务计划的基础。由于单纯从开支打算，业务上存在保本和赢利观点，认为赚了钱也是为社员服务，资金扩大了，合作社才可以更好的给社员办事。因此在业务上不是想尽办法满足社员的需要，而是找理由经营非社员的生意，分散了合作社的经营力量，混淆了服务对象。对于经济核算制，也存在着一种错误看法，即认为核算制就是多赚钱。没有认识到经济核算制，就是要从积极满足社员方面去扩大销货额，节约各种开支，减少物品伤耗，尽一切力量减低成本，使社员得到比较便宜的物品。产生这些偏向的原因，是由于领导工作中存在资本主义积累资金的观点，不知从避免中间剥削和在企业化的经营中进行合理的积累资金。
    二、整顿业务、克服赢利思想、面向基层社、面向社员
    根据以上检查，我们工作中主要的缺点是资本主义路线的偏向。因此，我们在整社工作中，首先从业务整顿起。在整顿业务中，要从服务社员、满足社员需要，克服经营中的赢利思想为中心。我们的具体作法是这样的：
    第一、实行上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务的方针。合作法规定：“合作社应集中全力去满足社员的需要”。总社首先取消了门市零售和市场批发工作，集中全力为基层社服务。从八月到十月份，非社员贸易只占总销货额的百分之四·三，其中非社员部分主要是机关部队的油盐供应和一部分旧粮食和冷背货的处理。取消对非社员的贸易和面向基层社后，销货额不但没有减少，而且逐月上升。兹将七至十月份销货额与销货对象分析如下：销货对象 基层社  非基层社          总金额   销货额月别      金额      ％    金额      ％                增减指数七月份   八九·   七五    二八     二四     一一八    一○○
           四亿   ·五％  ·九亿   ·五％   ·三亿    ·○八月份 一○一·   九○·  一一·   一○·   一一三    九五·
           六亿   ○％    七亿     ○％     ·三亿    七九月份 一一五·   九四·  七·     五·     一二二·  一○三·
           八亿   二％    一亿     八％     九亿      九十月份 一四六·   九五·  六·     四·     一五三·  一二八·
           五亿   七％    六亿     三％     一亿      四
    此外，商品由一千零三十一种减少到七百种，最近还要减少不必需的种类和牌号太杂的商品二百种。这样，资金力量集中到社员必需的主要的货品上去，可以节省六十五个工作人员，并加强了采购、运输、和核算部门的工作。同时，基层社对总社的关系也比较密切了。有一个基层社的干部说：“这次总社从方针上转变很好。如总社不转变，不但总社要垮，我们也得跟着垮。”
    第二、根据社员需要，主动地有计划地实行定时、定量、定质、定价（比较低廉的）配售生活必需品，并在农村供销社进行收购社员的农产品。
    从前我们在业务经营上是比较盲目的，没有计划的。社员需要什么，我们不知道；我们有什么，社员也不知道，多半是根据主观愿望和市场情况进行采购。既不能根据社员需要来进货，更谈不到满足社员需要。为了了解社员需要，我们进行了对工人、农民和学生经济情况的典型调查。
    根据城内职工五十九户社员生活需要的调查，每人每月平均需要开支七五、八九八元（按八月十五日价格计算），其中粮食为三○·六一斤，合计三四、二六三·五元；副食品计二七、○三五·五元（计花生油、香油合计○·九四斤，食盐半斤，碱半斤，酱油一斤）；日用品计七、○六二·九元（包括纸烟、火柴、肥皂、牙刷、袜子、毛巾等）；煤球七六·三三斤，劈柴五·二四斤，计七、五三六·一元。因为职工收入不等，故消耗也不同。
    按农民来说，日用品主要是食盐、布、棉、煤油、火柴、针线、煤炭等，春天需要粮食、籽种、肥料和杀虫药等生产资料。每个农民平均一年购买约八·五尺洋布，棉花半斤（主要是补充）。一盏灯平均一月需用灯油半斤。一人一年需盐二十斤，因为郊区一般农户皆自己作酱，多者三斗（每斗二十斤豆）少者一斗，每斗需盐十斤至十五斤。每户腌菜一百斤，需盐二十斤，火柴一月半包。这是一般日用品的需要情况。按郊区农村小学生的文具消费来说，每个小学生一月需铅笔二支，大仿本三本，作文簿半本，白报纸二本，合计二千元。
    我们根据这些基本需要的情况，试行几种主要生活必需品定量、定时、定价的配售，首先从郊区作起（城内也进行了，如大米、苹果、白菜、土豆、白糖的配售）。例如郊区合作社第一次在一周中即配售出大米一二五、六五三斤，食盐一七八、四二五斤，布头九、九九○尺，棉花一三、一四九斤，配售总值四五、六七八万元，比市价便宜七、三二一万元，有四五、九八九个社员享受到定量、廉价的物资。
    自从九月份开始至十一月十五日，二个半月来共配售各类物资总额五十三亿元。同时，结合供给社员必需品，我们进行了农副产品的收购工作，并在灾区由合作社组织熬硝，目前已收购四十万斤。
    第三、实行产地采购、矿厂订货、自己加工、精打细算、降低成本。
    为了保证供应比较廉价的物资，除了国家的优待外，必须改善社的经营工作。主动设法降低商品成本，是很重要的一环。
    １、产地采购。例如第一次在长沙买大米回来后，市场批发价一、二五○元，而我们卖到社员手中每斤才一、一七○元。
    ２、矿厂订货。直接到盐滩买盐的成本八八·一五七元，卖到社员每斤九五○元，比市场便宜百分之一五·六。又直接和市企业公司订立火柴和纸张供应合同。这样货物来源有了保证，厂方也有了比较固定的主顾，使生产者迅速的、直接的、有计划的与消费者联合起来了，促进了质量的提高。如市企业公司翔凤火柴因为私人经营了一个时期，好放炮，划不着，在市场上原来威信不高，企业公司经营后质量已有改进，但在群众中还留下不好的影响，我们便向社员保证，如有上面缺点管换；企业公司同样向我们保证。这样，商品在群众中就容易取得信仰。
    ３、自己加工，既能保证质量亦能降低成本。例如面粉每袋比贸易公司优待价格尚便宜七八○元，全月加工十万袋即差七、八○○万元。短腰冬季厚线袜自己加工每只二、二七○元，如到市场则每只二、九四○元。碱块自己加工每块三二○元，私商批发每块三六○元或三八○元。自己办加工或加工厂是降低成本很重要的一环。  ４、精打细算，降低成本。过去我们对计算工作是不够精密的，因此物品成本不能认真的降低。例如加工面粉没有烤干机以前，每百斤麦子只交七十三斤面粉，添设烤干机以后，每百斤交七十四斤面粉；全月加工六百八十万斤麦子，可多交六万八千斤面粉。又如运输环节计划得好，货物卸车后，即可不用倒仓，直接运到基层社，每袋粮食可节省十一两伏地玉米。石景山区运盐一车（三十吨），从车站上直接分配到基层社，每吨节省运费小米十斤，出入仓费二千元，合计共节省小米三百斤，合十二万元。每斤盐即降低成本七·二元。总社从河南运回麦十车，直接运往加工工厂，中间节省车费三九八万元。
    因此，纠正了资本主义的经营思想，就必须加强经济核算思想，有了正确的计算，才有合理的经营。
    第四、正确地掌握价格政策，规定合理的利润率。
    价格政策的掌握是很重要的。价格政策的正确掌握，是资本主义与半社会主义经营的分水岭，也是合理经营的集中表现。合作社究竟应根据什么原则规定价格呢？我们采取的是原价加运费、利息、伤耗、包装折旧费，印花税再加百分之二的利润（这是最高额）为批发价。关于本市工厂订货，直接取货，不加利润或仅加利息，基层社的毛利最高不得超过百分之七。总社批发基层社的配售物品，一律统一价格，不许高，也不许低，这样既防止了个别合作社的提高售价的赢利思想，也保证了合作社的合理利润。目前有个别合作社发生原本来原本去，有的甚至赔钱卖；这是对长期利益及合理的资金积累认识不够的偏向。但主要偏向仍是赢利思想。
    我们认为价格的规定不单是行情及批货人员的事，而是执行国家政策，服务社员的具体表现，因此负责人必须亲自审查和掌握才行。
    三、主要收获和经验
    一、开始克服盲目性，初步向计划性发展，加速了资金的周转。
    取消非社员交易，实行定量供给，这是走向计划性的根本关键。正如基层社干部检讨时说，“进行非社员交易，主顾是不固定的。物价平稳时他不来，稍有利益可图他就来了，这样很难掌握。”只取消非社员交易还不行，必须实行对社员的几种主要物品的定量供给。如果让社员可以买到超出自己需要量的东西，合作社的计划也要被破坏的。
    这样按社员定量的供应，就可以制订业务计划。根据这个业务计划，就可定出运输计划。货来到以前，即先通知各基层社应分配数量及价格，有的合作社事先做好需要统计，并准备好家具（如装煤油的小桶），货到车站即直接取走，免得出入仓库的麻烦，又节省运费。如石景山区的食盐由车站直接取货，即节省运杂费四三六、五○○元，运回后即分配，这样从天津运煤油，七天可以分配完毕，将资金转回来。社员根据价格和应该购买的数量，事先将款准备好了，更加速了资金的周转，也克服了购多销少或销多无货的矛盾。使业务自上而下，自下而上地开始有计划的发展。
    二、明确规定了服务对象，社员得到直接利益。
    社员是不欢迎作非社员生意的。许多社员说：“不入社股的也一样买东西，谁还参加合作社呢？合作社经营非社员交易，稍有便宜就被他们抢先买走了，社员反倒摸不着；干部专门想挣钱，对社员的需要和利益就没有时间和精力照顾了。”北郊窑边村社员批评村社干部说：“合作社收购非社员的粮食，等我们到合作社卖粮食时，合作社没有款了，这是不合理的，应当首先照顾社员才好！”
    定量廉价的分配，使广大社员得到直接利益。例如郊区在七天之内，将价值四五六、七八七、七四○元的物资，直接分配到四五、九八九个社员手中，可避免七三、二一○、二六○元的中间剥削。这样一来，社员关心着自己应得的利益，非社员也积极要求参加合作社了。
    三、巩固扩大了合作社的组织。
    定量分配以后，社员得到直接利益，想退股的不退了，已经退了股的要求重新入社。如石景山区固城衙门口的合作社，有的社员退了股，又背着玉米到合作社要求入社。金鼎山村群众原来参加北辛安村社，今春村长打算在本村成立合作社，把股金叫群众退出去了；合作社没有成立起来，群众又到北辛安卖花生，因不收非社员的，他们埋怨村长，并要求重新入社。股少的积极增股，没有入股的积极请求入社，地主富农也要求入社（因为取消非社员交易，买不到东西了）。入了股没有交股金的“名誉社员”，也积极主动交股金了。沟泥河村社在配售中，补交股金的就有二百七十一人，并新增加了三十股。郊区农村供销社自十月下旬到十一月上旬，新增加社员四、五九八人，占郊区原有社员的百分之六·一，增加股金米二二、九九○斤，占原有股金的百分之五·四。
    四、开展了合作社的民主，密切了社员与合作社的关系。
    在这次配售中，一般合作社都召开了理监事会、代表会或社员大会，对合作社方针进行了宣传和讨论。许多社员批评了做非社员交易不对，干部对社员服务态度不好。如西红门社员代表说：“过去发放农贷，干部不开会，办的不公平，以后不召开会，我们也要来。”旧宫村一个社员说：“这次合作社比过去好了，既给社员谋利益，又让大家讨论，多好！”东郊索罗营陈老太太找到合作社说：“通是社员，为什么配售布头没有我的呢？”社员对合作社开始感到兴趣，在配售中并提出新的要求，说是有了针还应预备顶针。她们还要求有鞋面布、擦脸油、短腰袜、花布等。有的社员提出，如煤油每斤超过八千元，合作社就应准备花生油点灯用。
    合作社应关心妇女和儿童社员的需要，与社员当前最迫切需要的东西。这次配售的针，妇女社员很欢迎，对发动妇女社员作用很大。北郊关庄一老太太背着玉米去入股，首先问配售的针是否还有他的。西郊黑塔村一个老太太背着玉米去合作社入股，首先问棉花是否还来，如果来就入股，不来就不入了。此外，合作社还应当注意儿童的需要。关庄小学二十一个学生即订购各种本子一百一十八本，铅笔十二支，毛笔两支。有的小学生的家长未入社，小学生为了买本子，就拉着祖母去入合作社。所以经常注意妇女儿童的需要，对引导广大群众参加合作社作用是很大的。
    四、需要解决的几个问题
    一、大部分干部对服务社员、克服资本主义经营偏向的认识还是不够，不积极去满足现有社员要求，而迷恋于非社员交易，企图单纯地用扩大社员的方法来弥补非社员贸易额部分。
    有的干部把定量廉价配售，当成一般经营方法，没有认识到这就是半社会主义性质的合作社的分配经营方针，是防止与克服资本主义路线和盲目经营达到计划经营，保证社员利益的有效方法。
    有的干部对限量认识不够，不知道所谓定量廉价配售，就是主动地有计划地保证社员主要物品的需要。
    有的合作社没有与组导工作很好结合，没有按照廉价定量定时办法进行，而是长流水的卖法，因此对社员教育作用不大。总的情况，目前是组导赶不上业务，业务赶不上群众需要。在积极满足社员需要下，应当加强宣传教育工作和社员组织工作，特别是合作社法的宣传更重要。应当时时刻刻警惕着资本主义路线在合作社中的发展，因为合作社本身还包含有产生资本主义的因素，合作社路线正确的体现就是两条路线的斗争与统一。
    二、贫苦社员入社问题。有许多农村中的贫雇农和城市中比较困难的工人职员，家里人多，参加合作社的人少。这样按社员分配以后，不入社的人口就享受不到权利，全家入社一下子又交不起股金，很是为难。对于这种情形，应该经过理事会讨论决定贫苦人入社，股金分期交纳的办法，否则将会使广大劳动人民被关在合作社门外。
    三、按户配售还是按社员配售呢？基本原则应按社员配售，但有的带季节性的并且以户为计划单位的货物，应照顾到户的需要。如食盐在腌菜季节，按人配售不行，有的户腌菜多，有的户少。肥料是按土地和需要来决定，因此又应适当照顾季节性需要，将配售量适当提高，或者采取两种价格，除应得配售者外，想多用时可以到合作社里去买，但价格可以高些。现在就是这样执行的。
    四、物资来源问题。几种主要物资应当经常地给予保证，合作社才能发展与巩固。因此，必须依靠国营企业和上级社，国家应当制定通过合作社的销售给以合理的优待。没有国家的扶植，合作社是不能发展和巩固的。新的优待办法应当早日公布。同时，必须结合收购推销农产品或副业产品，才能提高群众购买力，畅通城乡物资，使合作社的业务不致停顿。
