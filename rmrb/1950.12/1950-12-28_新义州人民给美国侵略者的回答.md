Sinuiju is a light industrial city with a population of about 130,000. Facing the Yalu River, it is surrounded by vast and fertile paddy fields producing large quantities of rice. To the northeast, it has the imposing White Horse Mountain, a majestic sight.

The city's wide and level streets were clean and beautiful, and commerce was usually bustling. After the "August 15th" liberation in 1945, the Korean people themselves established primary and secondary schools, nurseries, homes for the elderly, hospitals, newspapers, and bookstores in many magnificent buildings, and also opened beautiful parks.

The city also had a long-standing famous paper mill, a machinery factory, and some other small factories, whose products were sold everywhere, and the workers lived a life of plenty.

But this beautiful city was almost entirely destroyed by the American air force bandits. This is a blood debt that can never be forgiven, and the Chinese and Korean people (a considerable number of Chinese nationals live in Sinuiju) will never forget this blood debt!

Twenty days after the bombing, I visited this afflicted city. With a very painful heart and heavy steps, I walked through those ruined streets. In the originally prosperous Baiyun area, apart from the precarious remains of a few large buildings and dozens of short chimneys made of red bricks, all that could be seen was rubble. Broken utility poles hung in the air, transformers lay on the ground, torn white shirts fluttered on the overhead wires, and broken lathes, drilling machines... these machines were scattered haphazardly among the tiles and bricks.

In the bitter cold wind, refugees dressed in thin clothes shivered and wandered over the rubble, using short sticks to dig up any furniture that might have been left underground.

I walked further to the outside of the dam, where most of the houses were originally thatched cottages, but now nothing was left except rubble, a desolate scene!

We walked near a small air-raid shelter and found that this air-raid shelter had become the "home" for the bombing victims. Near this "home," the large urns that the Korean people liked to use and the unique cooking pots were placed on one side, and the black frozen cabbage was placed on broken bricks. An old woman, dressed in thin clothes, crawled out of the door, and there was a noise of children inside. I asked:

"Is life difficult?"

The old woman did not look sad at all. According to the translator, only three of her ten family members were left. She said very frankly:

"Difficult? Of course, it's difficult."

"What are your plans for the future?"

She spread out her rough hands and said:

"I still have hands, I still have strength, I will live on!"

"Do you know that the front is winning?"

"I know, my two sons and one daughter are all on the front lines, with your volunteer troops, of course, they are winning!"

"Aren't you afraid?"

"Afraid? What else can the American devils do to me?"

This is a very ordinary old woman. People like her, who have suffered enormous disasters but still maintain a high degree of confidence in victory and optimism, are common.

In the evening, in one place, I met farmers from various places. A farmer from Taechon said that during this counter-attack by the People's Army and the Chinese Volunteer Army, they captured 25,000 prisoners in their area. A person from Chongju said that they captured 5,000 in Chongju, all of them Turks, and another person rushed to say that they were Americans.

A female village cadre from Changsong said:

"What else can the American devils do besides bombing? Even if they bomb Korea flat, they will still fail!

The Chinese Volunteer Army lived in our area, and their discipline was extremely good. Which ordinary people didn't like them? I knew long ago that if the People's Army fought alongside the Volunteer Army, the American aggressors would have to fail!"

I met a comrade from the Korean Workers' Party, and he said calmly:

"The atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea cannot be described in one sentence. This heinous bombing of Sinuiju is not special. Today, there is no city, large or small, in the whole of Korea that has not been bombed. Later, they bombed large villages, then small villages, and now, as long as there is a yellow cow on the road, or a farmer walking, they routinely strafe at low altitude.

"Such insane atrocities have never been seen in history. But after the bombing of Sinuiju, the young and middle-aged people who remained here submitted blood letters one after another, vowing to take revenge and requesting to join the army and participate in the recovery team. Now many people have gone to the front lines, and this is the first answer to the inhuman bombing!

"Then the farmers in the suburbs donated 8,000 bags of rice to support the front lines and relieve the refugees. This is the second answer!

"The third answer is the great victory of the counter-offensive by the People's Army and the Chinese Volunteer Army!

"The remaining answers are waiting for the American aggressors, and they will gradually taste the flavor!"

Later, I met another comrade from the Workers' Party, and he told me some specific details. On November 28th, according to incomplete statistics, more than 5,000 farmers in the four suburbs provided the following items to comfort the Chinese Volunteer Army: (Korean farmers raise very few poultry and livestock, but they still enthusiastically donated) one old cow, 28 fat pigs, 492 chickens, 15 ducks, 1,500 catties of rice, one grass bag of chestnuts (100 catties), 24 towels, 2,060 catties of pears, 450 braids of garlic, and 126,400 won in cash, equivalent to more than 50 million Northeast currency.

This is only the love and support for the Chinese Volunteer Army expressed by the farmers in the suburbs of Sinuiju. They all smile when they talk about the Chinese Volunteer Army.

In the evening, we visited a rural village ten li outside the city. The harvested rice was piled all around the village. Twelve women and children lived in a small house. They talked and told their stories, with no pessimism at all. The village chief and the branch secretary had gone out to a meeting that day. The women's federation chairman came in a hurry, and she wrote her name, Kim Ui-bo, crookedly in my notebook. She probably had no opportunity to study before "August 15th." She is 24 years old this year, her husband is a poor farmer, and he joined the army on July 5th this year. During the land reform, she was allocated 1,500 bows of paddy fields (more than eight mu), and she lived with her three-year-old child and her family of three, and her life was originally very good. But her husband resolutely joined the army, and she not only took on the full responsibility of agricultural production and taking care of the child, but also did a good job in the work of the Women's League. Now they—the Women's League—guarantee to do a good job in production and ensure that the People's Army and the bombed cities have enough grain to eat!

The rural women were very happy to hear that the Chinese Volunteer Army had joined the war. This young woman did not hide her feelings and said:

"The American aggressors are murderous devils! We are now fighting a life-and-death struggle, either they die or we die. But we must achieve final victory!"

Bombing, massacre, burning, humiliation... The unparalleled cruelty of the atrocities has educated the Korean people and ignited their flames of angry revenge to the highest degree.

A heavier blow than the last is waiting for the American imperialist aggressors, and the invaders will receive their due punishment!

    新义州人民给美国侵略者的回答
    谢挺守
    新义州是个轻工业城市，人口约十三万。面临着鸭绿江，周围是广阔丰美的水田，出产着大量的稻子，东北面有高峻的白马山，形势十分雄伟。
    市内宽平的街道整洁而美观，平时商业也很繁盛。许多雄伟的大楼，在一九四五年“八一五”解放后，由朝鲜人民自己开办了小学和高等学校、托儿所、养老院、医院、报社、书店，并且还开辟了美丽的公园。
    市内还有历史悠久的有名的造纸工厂、机械工厂，和一些其他小工厂，产品销行各处，工人们过着丰衣足食的生活。
    但是这座美丽的城市是被美国空军强盗几乎整个地炸毁了。这是一笔绝对不能宽宥的血海深仇，中朝人民（有相当数量的中国侨民住在新义州）永不会忘记这笔血债！
    在被炸的二十天后，我去访问了这个受难的城市。我以非常痛楚的心情，踏着沉重的步伐，走过那些残破的街道。在原来繁华的白云闾一带，除了几所大楼的岌岌可危的残墙断壁和几十根用红砖砌成的短烟囱外，满目都是瓦砾。烧断的电线杆在半空挂着，变压器在地上倒着，撕碎了的白衬衫在半空的电线上飘着，残破的旋床、钻床……这些机器，杂乱地倾倒在瓦片残砖中。
    在凛冽的寒风中，穿着单衣抖缩着的难民，徘徊在瓦砾上用，短棍去发掘地下可能留下的一些家具。
    我再走到坝外去，这里原来大部是草房，现在是除了瓦砾外，什么都不剩了，是一片凄惨的景象！
    我们走到一座小防空壕附近，发现这座防空壕已变为炸后灾民的“家”了。在这“家”的近旁，朝鲜人民欢喜用的大瓮和特有的烧饭的锅，放在一边，漆黑的冻白菜放在破砖上。一个老太太，穿着单薄的衣服钻出门来，里面有小孩的喧闹声。我问：
    “生活困难吧？”
    老太太丝毫也没有悲哀的样子，据翻译的人说她一家十口，只留下三个人，她很坦白地说：
    “困难？当然困难的。”
    “今后准备怎样呢？”
      她摊开两只粗糙的手说：
    “我还有双手，还有力气，今后就是活下去！”
    “前方打胜仗知道么？”
    “知道，我的两个儿子，一个女儿都在前线，跟你们的志愿部队在一起，当然打胜仗的！”
    “不害怕么？”
    “害怕？美国鬼子还能把我怎样？”
    这是一个很普通的老太太。像她这样遭受了巨大的灾难，仍然保持着高度的胜利信心与乐观的人普遍地存在着。
    晚上，在一个地方，见到从各地来的农民。从泰川来的农民说，这次人民军与中国志愿部队一反攻，在他们那里就抓了两万五千俘虏。从定州来的人就说，在定州一下就抓了五千，尽是土耳其人，另一个就抢着说，是美国人。
    从昌城来的一个女村干部说：
    “美国鬼子除了轰炸，还有什么本事？就是把朝鲜炸平了，他们还是要失败的！
    中国志愿部队在我们那边住过，纪律好极了，那个老百姓不喜欢。我早知道，人民军跟志愿军一起打仗，美国侵略军非失败不行！”
    我见到朝鲜劳动党一位同志，他平静地说：
    “美国侵略军在朝鲜的暴行，不是一下说的完的。对新义州的这种罪恶的轰炸，不是特殊的，今天来讲，全朝鲜的大小城市没有不被轰炸的。后来轰炸大的屯子，接着是小屯子，现在呢，只要路上有头黄牛，或者有个农民走路，照例是要低飞扫射。
    “这样丧心病狂的罪行，是历史上没有见过的。但轰炸新义州后，我们这里留下的青壮年，纷纷的递上了血书，发誓要报仇，要求参军和参加恢复队。现在有许多人已上前线了，这就是给无人道的轰炸的第一个回答！
    “接着四郊的农民又献出了八千包大米，用作支援前线和救济难民，这是第二个回答！
    “第三个回答就是人民军与中国志愿部队的反攻大捷！
    “其余的回答等着美国侵略军，他们会逐渐尝到滋味的！”
    后来我又见到劳动党一位同志，他告诉了我一项具体的材料。在十一月二十八日这一天，四郊五千多户农民慰劳中国志愿部队的东西，据不完全的统计：（朝鲜农民养家禽家畜的很少，但仍热烈地献出）老牛一头，肥猪二十八只，鸡四九二只，鸭子十五只，大米一千五百斤，栗子一草包（一百斤），手巾二十四条，梨二○六○斤，蒜四五○辫，现款十二万六千四百元鲜币，合东北币五千多万元。
    这仅是新义州市郊农民所表现的对中国志愿部队的热爱与拥护。他们一谈起中国志愿部队都是笑逐颜开的。
    晚上，我们去访问了离市十里外的一个农村，丰收的稻子堆满了村子周围。在一个小房子里住着十二个妇人与小孩。她们谈着诉说着，丝毫没有悲观的情绪。这天村长与支书都出去开会去了。匆匆忙忙来了妇女会长，她歪歪斜斜地在我的笔记本上写了她的名字金义宝，“八一五”前大概是没有机会学习的。今年二十四岁，丈夫是贫农，今年七月五日参军了。土改时，分到了一五○○弓水田（八亩多），带着一个三岁孩子，一家三口人，生活原来很不错。但丈夫毅然的参军了，她不仅负起农业生产与带好孩子的全部责任，还要做好妇女同盟的工作。现在她们——妇女同盟保证搞好生产，保证人民军与被轰炸的城市有足够的粮食吃！
    这次听到中国志愿部队参战，农村的妇女高兴的了不得，这位年青的少妇，毫不掩饰她的感情地说：
    “美国侵略军是杀人魔王啊！我们现在是做生死斗争，不是他死，就是我死。但是，我们一定要取得最后胜利！”
    在被轰炸，被屠杀，被烧毁，被侮辱……的残酷无比的暴行中，教育了朝鲜人民，把他（她）们愤怒的复仇火焰引烧到最高度了。
    一个比一个沉重的打击，在等着美帝侵略军，侵略者会得到应有的惩罚的！
          一九五○年十二月五日
