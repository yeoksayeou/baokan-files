    Newly Returned Students from the U.S. Publish Patriotic Anti-American Declaration

    [This newspaper's dispatch] More than eighty students, including Du Du and Liu Xin Xian, who recently returned from studying in the United States, issued a declaration on December 13, denouncing Austin's insults to the Chinese people and expressing their determination to resist America and love their country. The text of the declaration is as follows:

    We are students who have recently returned from the United States, and we solemnly refute and protest against Austin's shameless lies in the United Nations Security Council, which reversed black and white and confused right and wrong.

    The U.S. imperialist policy towards China has always been aggressive and reactionary. Its cultural aggression is even more a bloodless poisoned arrow. The U.S. imperialists opened schools in China and induced Chinese students to study in the U.S. in order to dominate China spiritually, create helpers for Wall Street capitalists to carry out aggression in China, and sell the "American way of life." Except for a handful of shameless scum like Hu Shi and Jiang Tingfu, every student who has studied in the U.S. can understand the ugly face of U.S. imperialist cultural aggression.

    The U.S. imperialists have always used various deceptive and enticing methods to try to make us so-called "democratic individualists." However, when we express the independent will and patriotic sentiments of the Chinese people, what follows is surveillance, questioning, illegal searches, unreasonable insults, and even unwarranted arrests, and all kinds of obstacles to returning to our country. In the so-called "free" and "democratic" United States, we almost felt that we had no freedom to breathe. Is this what Mr. Austin calls "friendship"? !

    Recently, the U.S. imperialists' series of armed aggression in Korea, Taiwan, and the northeastern border has made us realize even more clearly that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. No amount of rhetoric can hide its fox tail.

    There is friendship between the Chinese and American people; but we have no friendship whatsoever with the likes of Truman, Acheson, MacArthur, and Austin.

    We have just returned from the United States and have the deepest feelings about U.S. imperialist bloody aggression. We know that there is no third way between justice and fraud, revolution and counter-revolution, peace and war. We will forever stand on the side of the Chinese people and do our utmost in the great movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. Wherever we go, we will raise the banner of resistance against U.S. imperialism high.

    Newly Returned Students from the U.S.: Du Du, Liu Xin Xian, Zhang Yuan Yi, Wang Jue, Zhang Xiang Jun, and more than eighty others.

### 新近回国留美学生发表爱国抗美宣言

    新近回国留美学生发表爱国抗美宣言
    【本报讯】新近返国的留美学生杜度、刘心显等八十余人，于十二月十三日发表宣言，斥责奥斯汀侮辱中国人民，表示要坚决抗美爱国。宣言原文如下：
    我们是新近从美国回来的学生，在这里严正地驳斥并抗议奥斯汀在联合国安全理事会颠倒黑白、混淆是非的无耻谰言。
    美帝国主义的对华政策，一向是具有侵略性和反动性的。它的文化侵略更是一枝杀人不见血的毒箭。美帝在中国开办学校，和诱致中国学生赴美留学，为的是要在精神上支配中国，制造华尔街资本家在中国实施侵略的帮手，并倾销“美国生活方式”。除去胡适之蒋廷黻那一批无耻的败类外，每一个留美学生都能了解美帝文化侵略的狰狞面目。
    美帝始终用种种欺骗利诱的方式，企图使我们成为所谓“民主个人主义者”。但是，当我们表现中国人民的独立意志和爱国情绪时，跟着来的就是监视、盘问、非法的搜查、无理的侮辱，甚至无辜的拘捕，和千方百计的阻挠回国。在所谓“自由”“民主”的美国，竟使我们几乎感到没有呼吸的自由。这就是奥斯汀先生所说的“友谊”？！
    最近美帝在朝鲜、台湾和东北边境一连串的武装侵略行动，更使我们认清美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。任何花言巧语都遮不住它的狐狸尾巴。
    中美人民之间是存在着友谊的；但是我们和杜鲁门、艾奇逊、麦克阿瑟、奥斯汀之流是决无友谊可言的。
    我们刚从美国回来，对美帝的血腥侵略感受最深，知道在正义与欺诈，革命与反革命，和平与战争之间没有第三条路。我们永远站在中国人民的立场，在抗美援朝、保家卫国的伟大运动中尽我们最大的责任。我们到那里，就一定要把反抗美帝的旗帜高举到那里。
    新近返国留美学生杜度、刘心显、张元一、王珏、张祥军等八十余人。
