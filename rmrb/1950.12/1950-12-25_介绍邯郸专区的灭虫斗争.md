In early March of this year, when the weather was still cold, flea beetles appeared on rapeseed in Wei County, Daming, Guangping, Quzhou, Linzhang, Yongnian, Feixiang, Handan, Cheng'an and other counties; locusts bred in some wasteland and cemeteries in Quzhou, Daming, Qiu County, Ci County, etc., followed by red spiders and cutworms in many places of spring seedlings. Later, after the cotton seedlings emerged, aphids and boll weevils began to occur. By early June, cotton aphids were prevalent throughout the district; locusts plagued eleven counties. Early emergence and a wide variety became the characteristics of this year's pest outbreak, which did not stop until late autumn.

The government vigorously led a comprehensive pest control campaign. Whether for the masses or many of our cadres, this was still a relatively unfamiliar task. At the beginning, some people did not pay attention to this work, and even had the wrong idea of ​​not believing in science, such as: "Pests are there every year," "Natural disasters cannot be cured," "It is not the year for harvest..." Regarding cotton aphids, many people said: "Cotton is covered in honey, there will be a great show in autumn," "Cotton heads are covered in honey, buy an ox in the autumn harvest," "Cotton is tightly packed, one year is worth two years..." They were unwilling to take action when there were few pests, and only reported temporarily and tried to catch them or became pessimistic and disappointed when pests became a disaster. In Wei County, Daming, Feixiang, Guangping, Cheng'an and other counties, the flea beetles on rapeseed were eaten up before they hurriedly reported to the higher authorities.

In order to realize the production increase plan, the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office seized the pest control work and put forward the slogan "Where the pest disaster occurs, eliminate it there," eliminating them as they appear to prevent their existence and reproduction. Significant results have been achieved in implementing pest control this year, ensuring that various pests have not become disasters. Therefore, the experience and methods of pest control are worth introducing.

First, strengthening organizational leadership and improving and enriching the pest control organizations in counties, districts, and villages are a strong guarantee for promoting pest control. The pest control organization is composed of four parts: propaganda, organization, inspection, and technology, with specific division of labor, establishing a system of responsibility at each level and a strict reporting system. Once pests occur, action must be taken immediately according to the situation. Some places have also paid special attention to horizontal connections. The joint pest control headquarters was established in Lizhuang area, the junction of Linzhang and Cheng'an. Many villages established pest control covenants through democratic discussions to implement the government's call.

Second, implement unified plans and implement unified leadership. First, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office formulated a pest control plan through meetings of various professional departments, and organized a technical research committee led by the Prefectural Commissioner's Office's Agricultural Section to implement unified organization and leadership, so that administration and technology closely cooperated.

Third, leaders attach importance and prepare in a timely manner. This year, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office first prepared more than 8,700 sprayers, more than 20,000 jin of rotenone powder, 25,000 jin of sodium fluosilicate, 8,000 jin of DDT, and 400,000 jin of tobacco, and distributed them to various counties according to plan, and then distributed them from the counties to various districts and villages. Therefore, the enthusiasm of various places for pest control was brought into play. In addition, the masses were mobilized to purchase medicine and machinery by themselves or in groups. In the work of preventing pests, digging and collecting eggs and implementing inspections were organized. This spring, Daming mobilized more than 1,700 people and more than 1,000 livestock to remove eggs and eliminate wasteland for more than 28,000 mu. After locusts occurred in the wasteland in Qiu County, they organized catching and beating on the one hand, and organized reclamation on the other hand, leveling roads and hoeing graves. More than 140 mu of grain seedlings in Tianshuizhuang and Beiyou Village in Quzhou were found to have armyworm eggs. After timely removal of eggs and catching moths, the occurrence of armyworms was stopped.

Fourth, hold short-term training to cultivate backbones. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office has been seizing the time, combining with the actual pest control movement, to instill various pest control technologies. This year, it has held four short-term training courses. In the spring, the focus was on seed mixing, egg digging, and aphid prevention. After wheat harvest, the focus was on eliminating red spiders, rice leaf rollers, aphids, and locusts. In the autumn, the elimination of armyworms was proposed, and the prevention and control of underground pests was implemented during wheat sowing. A total of 5,040 people participated in the study, with at least 150 people in each county, and up to 500 or 600 people in many. In addition, more than 60,000 copies of various pest control teaching materials were printed and distributed. Trainees included village cadres, model workers, active farmers, and production committee members. Cadres and farmers who have learned the technology and have a new understanding of diseases and insects have formed the backbone and leading core of the pest control movement. For example, Li Ying from Dongxi Village, Wei County, immediately prepared tobacco after returning to the village from study and led the masses to control pests; Lu Fuchun, a party member from Huangguanying Village, Ci County, actively took the lead in conducting experiments in his own land, promoting the whole village. In addition, many places have implemented the policy of prevention is better than cure, publicizing and organizing deep plowing and careful cultivation, weeding, and egg collection. Hantun, Wei County, proposed a weeding competition. Based on the needs of the cause, many farmers requested to learn pest control methods during the winter slack season.

Fifth, focus on demonstrations, and use examples and specific accounting to get through the masses' thinking. Linzhang, Feixiang and other counties selected areas with convenient transportation and many pedestrians as demonstration villages, conducted demonstrations first, absorbed the majority of farmers to visit, and at the same time publicized pest control methods and specific accounting. Farmers saw that pest control was effective and understood that pest control was indeed beneficial, and they were all happy to accept it.

Sixth, combine with production to solve specific problems. The occurrence of aphids and locusts coincided with the wheat harvest and weeding, so it is necessary to appropriately allocate and use labor. The Handan Special District has done a very good job in combining pest control with production this year. In Daming, more than 40,000 women and children participated in pest control, accounting for three-quarters of the total number of people. In Hebei Village, Ci County, more than 20 mu of locust nymphs occurred, and more than 80 women eliminated them in one day. The pests were controlled, but production was not delayed.

    介绍邯郸专区的灭虫斗争
    今年三月上旬，天气还很冷，魏县、大名、广平、曲周、临漳、永年、肥乡、邯郸、成安等县的油菜上就发生了金花虫；曲周、大名、邱县、磁县等部分荒地、坟场生了蝗虫，继之很多地方的春苗闹红蜘蛛和地蚕。以后棉苗出土，蚜虫和象鼻虫就开始发生。到六月上旬，棉蚜已普遍全区；蝗虫闹遍了十一个县。生的早，种类多，成为今年虫害发生的特点，直到秋末，还没有停止。
    政府大力领导开展全面性的治虫运动，无论对群众，或我们的很多干部来说，还是个比较生疏的工作，开始时有些人不注意这一工作，甚至有不相信科学的错误思想，如：“虫子年年有”，“天灾治不了”，“天年不该收”……对棉花闹蚜虫，很多人这样说：“棉花遭了蜜，秋后唱大戏”“棉花蜜了头，秋收买个牛”“棉花攒攒拳，一年顶两年”……虫少时不愿动手，虫多时成灾了才临时报告，设法捕打或者悲观失望。魏县、大名、肥乡、广平、成安等县的油菜金花虫，有的被吃光了才赶忙报告上级。
    邯郸专署为了实现增产计划，抓紧了治虫工作，提出“虫灾发生在那里，消灭在那里”的口号，随生随灭，不使存在繁殖，在一年来贯彻治虫有了显著成绩，保证了各种虫害未能成灾，因此灭虫的经验和方法是值得介绍的。
    第一、加强组织领导，健全和充实县、区、村的灭虫组织，是推动灭虫的有力保证。灭虫组织以宣传、组织、检查和技术四股组成，具体分工，建立逐级负责制与严格的报告制度，害虫发生后要根据情况，立即行动。有些地方并特别注意了横的联系，临漳、成安接合部分之李庄一带建立了联合捕虫指挥部，不少村庄经过民主讨论建立灭虫公约，贯彻政府号召。
    第二、实行统一计划，贯彻统一领导。首先是专署通过各专业部门的会议，研究拟订了治虫计划，并以专署农业科为主组织了技术研究委员会，贯彻统一组织和领导，使行政与技术密切配合起来。
    第三、领导重视，准备及时。今年专署首先准备了八千七百余架喷雾器，二万多斤鱼藤粉，二万五千斤氟矽酸钠，八千斤ＤＤＴ和四十万斤烟草，有计划的分发各县，再由县分到各区、村。因此发挥了各地治虫的积极性。另外并发动群众自购或伙购药械。在预防害虫的工作上，组织了挖卵采卵与贯彻检查。大名今春曾发动一千七百余人和一千余头牲口进行除卵灭荒二万八千余亩，邱县荒地发生蝗虫后一面组织捕打，一面组织开荒，平路沟和锄坟头，曲周田水庄和北油村一百四十余亩谷苗发现黏虫卵，经过及时除卵捕蛾，制止了黏虫的发生。
    第四、举办短期训练，培养骨干。专署一直是抓紧时间，结合着实际的灭虫运动，灌输各种治虫技术，今年开办了四次短期训练班，春天以拌种、挖卵、预防蚜虫等为主。麦后一次，以消灭红蜘蛛、稻苞虫、蚜虫和蝗虫等为主。秋季又提出消灭黏虫，小麦播种时又贯彻了防治地下害虫。参加学习的共达五千零四十人，每县最少有一五○人，多者到五、六百人。此外还印发了各种灭虫教材六万多份。训练班学员包括村干、劳模、积极农民和生产委员等。学习过的干部和农民，学会了技术，对于病虫有了新的认识之后形成了灭虫运动中的骨干和领导核心。如魏县东薜村李英学习回村后立即准备烟草，领导群众治虫；磁县黄官营党员路伏春回村积极带头在自己地里作试验，推动全村。此外很多地方都贯彻了防重于治的方针，宣传组织深耕细作，除草、采卵，魏县韩屯提出除草竞赛。基于事业需要，很多农民要求冬闲时学习治虫方法。
    第五、重点示范，用实例和具体算账打通群众思想，临漳、肥乡等县选定交通方便，行人众多的地区为示范村，先行示范，吸收多数农民参观，同时宣传治虫办法，具体算账，农民看到治虫有效，又了解了治虫确实有利，无不乐于接受。
    第六、结合生产，解决具体问题。蚜虫、蝗虫的发生正值麦收和锄苗，因此必须适当的分配和运用劳力。邯郸专区今年在治虫结合生产上做得很有成效，大名在灭虫中参加打虫的妇女儿童四万多人，占总人数的四分之三，磁县河北村发生了二十多亩蝗蝻，八十多名妇女一天就把它消灭。虫也治了，但并没有误了生产。
