Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: A dispatch from Seoul on the 10th by an Associated Press reporter, a U.S. reactionary news agency, summarizing the war situation, reflects that the American aggressors have fallen into a pessimistic and desperate quagmire due to the disastrous defeat of the Korean War. The Associated Press said sadly: The American aggression against Korea "war has failed!" The attempt by the United States and its accomplice countries to destroy Korea "by force" has now become "an incurable cause." The so-called "first world army to participate in combat," which the imperialist group used for aggression, "has been decisively defeated by the army of only one major power (note: should be the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting alongside the Korean People's Army)." The Associated Press reporter sadly admitted that the Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting alongside the Korean People's Army, are "fully capable" of driving "all" the remnants of the U.S. Eighth Army and Tenth Corps "out of Korea." The so-called United Nations forces' superior firepower in terms of air force, tanks, and artillery did not outweigh the superiority of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in terms of infantry. "This war is mainly determined by small arms fire, machine guns, and mortars." The Associated Press reporter then reflected the U.S. imperialist group's distress at being unable to reinforce due to insufficient troops, saying: "The United Nations member states have not indicated that they will conscript or send hundreds of thousands of infantrymen here." Therefore, the Associated Press reporter lamented: "The victory or defeat of the war has been decided militarily. The Allies (note: meaning the United States and its accomplice countries) have lost. The CCP (note: should be the Chinese People's Volunteers) have won."

The Associated Press reporter also despairingly believes that the U.S. invading forces in Korea currently have "no other way" but to "escape by sea." "There is no place on this peninsula that the Chinese army (note: referring to the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting alongside the Korean People's Army) cannot attack. ... Looking at the map, it can be seen that the only thing that needs to be completed is: the United Nations forces hope to escape intact. ... Its current major military problem is: to save as many soldiers and equipment as possible."

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: According to TASS, New York, December 11th: John Steed, a "New York Times" correspondent in Tokyo, admitted that the morale of the American troops fighting in Korea is low. John Steed wrote: "U.S. officers and soldiers have found that their advantages in weapons, transportation, medical treatment, rations, and countless modern warfare inventions cannot guarantee victory. This discovery is a big blow to the morale of the U.S. military fighting in Korea." John Steed wrote: "Exhausted soldiers were forced to abandon trucks and set fire to jeeps. ... American soldiers' belief in their weapons has been drastically reduced. Soldiers on the Korean front have realized that although they have the best weapons in terms of equipment, they cannot stop enemies who are determined to move forward. This has caused a question with no answer in the minds of American soldiers." John Steed also wrote: U.S. field commanders complained that the enemy "forced us to conduct their kind of war according to their format."

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: "We have only learned to lose." This is the complaint of American soldiers on the Korean battlefield. An Associated Press war correspondent revealed this frustrated mood in the U.S. invading forces on the 8th, saying: "What have the American troops learned from their tragic and painful 'guarding' Korean campaign? In the past six months, they seem to have been sitting on a large military merry-go-round, turning from failure to victory, and from victory back to failure; the situation is so heartbreaking and discouraging that many soldiers answer with a mocking tone: We have not learned anything here, only learned to lose." The reporter admitted that "the losses of the U.S. military are heavy" and that the U.S. military's "future now looks terrible." The reporter seemed to want to "find a flame of hope in this desolate wilderness," but then sadly said: "However, this is just a bittersweet hope."

    美国反动记者发出哀鸣
    美侵朝战争败局已定       
    侵略军只希望完整地脱身
    【新华社十一日讯】美国反动通讯社美联社记者十日自汉城发出的一则综论战局的电讯，反映出美国侵略者因侵朝战争的惨败已陷入悲观绝望的泥沼中。美联社伤心地说：美国侵略朝鲜的“战争是失败了！”美国及其帮凶国家“使用武力”灭亡朝鲜的图谋，现在已成为“一件不可救药的事业了”。帝国主义集团用来进行侵略的所谓“第一支参加战斗的世界军队”，“已被仅仅一个大国的军队（按应为与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民志愿军）决定性地击败了”。美联社记者悲哀地承认：与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民志愿军，“完全能够”把美国第八军与第十兵团的残余部队“全部赶出朝鲜”。所谓的联合国部队在空军、坦克和大炮支援方面的优势火力，并没有胜过中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军在步兵方面的优势。“这次战争主要是由小型武器火力，机关枪和迫击炮决定的。”美联社记者接着反映了美帝国主义集团因兵力不足而无法增援的苦恼说：“联合国会员国并没有表示它们将征召或派遣数十万步兵到这里来”。因此，美联社记者悲鸣说：“战争在军事上胜负已定。盟国（按为美国及其帮凶国）已经打输了。中共（按应是中国人民志愿军）打赢了。”
    美联社记者又绝望地认为美国侵朝军队目前除了“从海路逃走”之外，“别无他法”。“在这个半岛上，没有一处地方是中国大军（按指与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的中国人民志愿军）袭击不到的。……看一下地图就可以知道：需要完成的唯一的事情是：联合国部队希望完整无缺地脱身。……它目前的巨大军事问题是：尽可能多地挽救最多的兵员与装备。”
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约十一日讯：《纽约时报》驻东京记者蒋斯登承认，在朝鲜作战的美军士气低沉。蒋斯登写道：“美军官兵发现：他们在武器、运输、医药治疗、口粮和无数近代战争的发明方面的优势，都不能保证胜利。这个发现对于在朝鲜作战的美军士气，是一个很大的打击。”蒋斯登写道：“打得精疲力尽的士兵被迫遗弃货车、放火焚毁吉普。……美国大兵对他们武器的信仰剧烈地降低了。兵士们在朝鲜前线体会到，他们在装备方面虽有最优良的武器，但却挡不住意志坚决地向前推进的敌人。这在美国大兵们的脑海中引起了还没有答案的一个问题。”蒋斯登并且写道：美国战地司令官埋怨说，敌军“迫使我们依照他们的格式，进行他们的那种战争”。
    【新华社十二日讯】“我们只学会了吃败仗。”这是朝鲜战场上美国士兵的怨言。美联社的一位随军记者在八日透露美国侵略军中这种沮丧的情绪时说：“美国军队从他们悲惨而痛苦的‘警卫’朝鲜的战役中学到了什么？他们在这半年中好像坐在一个大的军事走马灯上，由失败转向胜利，又由胜利转回失败；情况是这样使人伤心、使人丧气，以致许多士兵带着嘲讽的口气回答道：我们在这里没有学会什么东西，只学会了吃败仗。”该记者承认：“美军的损失是惨重的”，美军“前途现在看来是可怕的”。该记者惶惑地似乎想“在这绝望的荒野上找到希望之火”，但他接着又伤心地说：“但是，这也不过是一种内苦外甜的希望而已。”
