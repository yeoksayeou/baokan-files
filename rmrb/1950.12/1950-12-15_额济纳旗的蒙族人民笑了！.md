    The Mongolian People of Ejina Banner are Smiling!
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch
    The four hundred households, comprising over two thousand Mongolian compatriots, of Ejina Banner in Ningxia Province, reside on the grasslands between the parallel-flowing Narin and Mulin Rivers. These two rivers are the lifeline of the people of Ejina Banner. However, this fertile land once bore witness to a painful history of blood and tears.
    In 1939, the bandit Ma Hongkui dispatched bandit troops, outnumbering the population of Ejina Banner, to station themselves beside Juyan Lake in the lower reaches of the Mulin River. They forcibly seized the homes and pastures of the Mongolian people in the Mulin River area, demanding grain, grass, horses, and soldiers. They also instigated internal and inter-ethnic divisions and killings. The bandit troops, in order to construct the "Nation-Building Camp," wanted to transport timber from the Mulin River and recklessly blocked the Narin River, regardless of the people's lives, causing the Narin River to flood back into the Mulin River.
    Subsequently, the Narin River dried up year after year, the pastures withered, the beautiful paulownia trees turned yellow, the water birds flew away, the ducks disappeared, and more than one-third of the livestock died from epidemics. This forced the Mongolian compatriots, with tears in their eyes, to leave the grasslands where their ancestors had raced horses and grazed sheep, and move to the Mulin River area occupied by the bandit troops. There, they endured hunger and cold, suffering the oppression and devastation of the reactionaries. The bandits' barracks and the long "警戒线 (Jǐngjiè xiàn) - guard lines," became forbidden zones that could not be crossed. Many innocent herdsmen and livestock died under bayonets and bullets.
    After the liberation of Ningxia, the people of Ejina Banner celebrated their liberation with high enthusiasm for labor. In April, a workforce was organized there, and with grain and financial assistance from the Provincial People's Government, they dug through the Narin River, which had been blocked by the Ma bandits. The river, dry for ten years, now had water again, and the Mongolian compatriots smiled happily. They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Now, countless verdant paulownia trees are growing again on both banks, and the lush pastures are as high as a person's waist. Scattered white Mongolian yurts are hidden among the green willows and red paulownia trees. Strong Mongolian men and women ride swift horses, herding thousands of cattle and sheep across the vast pastures. Joyful songs echo everywhere along the Narin River:
    Water flows in the Narin River,
    The sun shines on the Ejina grassland,
    The people have freedom and happiness,
    We will always thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.
    Since the reopening of the Narin River, Ejina Banner has seen lush pastures and strong livestock, with a reproduction rate exceeding any previous year. Every family has ewes giving birth to twins. This year, camel wool production is expected to reach over ten thousand catties, and sheep wool production is expected to reach twenty thousand catties. Thanks to the People's Government's implementation of measures such as free trade and equal exchange, the Mongolian compatriots have exchanged their wool for grain, cloth, tea, sugar, and other daily necessities, living a prosperous and peaceful life with both people and livestock thriving. Excellent Mongolian youths have formed a people's cavalry to suppress bandits, eliminate spies, and stabilize security in the pastoral areas. The liberated Mongolian people vow to dedicate all their strength to the motherland.

    额济纳旗的蒙族人民笑了！
    新华社西安通讯
    宁夏省额济纳旗的四百户两千多蒙族同胞，聚居在纳林河与穆林河平行流贯的草原上，这两条河是额旗人民的生命线。就在这块水草丰茂的地方，曾有一段令人痛愤的血泪史。
    一九三九年马匪鸿逵派遣了比额旗人口还多的匪军驻在穆林河的下游居延海旁，强占了蒙胞在穆林河一带的住地和牧场，要粮、要草、要马、要兵，并制造了民族内部与民族间的对立和仇杀。匪军为修建“建国营”，要从穆林河放运木料，竟不顾人民死活，横蛮地堵塞了纳林河，使纳林河的水倒灌穆林河中。
    此后，纳林河一年一年地干涸了，牧草衰萎了，美丽的梧桐枯黄了，水鸟飞走了，游鸭绝迹了，因疫病而死亡的牲畜达三分之一以上。这迫使蒙族同胞含着眼泪，离开了祖辈跑马放羊的草原，搬到被匪军霸占的穆林河居住。在那里，他们忍饥耐寒，受尽了反动派的压榨和摧残。匪徒们的营房及漫长的“警戒线”，成为不可窥越的禁地。许多无辜的牧民和牲口死在刺刀和枪弹之下。
    宁夏解放后，额旗的人民以高度劳动热情来庆幸自己的解放。四月间，那儿组织了民工队，在省人民政府拨粮资助下挖通了被马匪堵塞的纳林河，干了十年的河有水了，蒙古同胞快乐地笑了。他们高呼：“毛主席万岁！”现在，两岸又生长出无数苍翠的梧桐，茂盛的牧草高到人腰，点点的白色蒙古包隐现在绿柳红桐丛中，健壮的蒙族男女骑着骏马，吆着千百成群的牛羊，骋驰在广阔的牧场上。纳林河畔到处洋溢着愉快的歌声：
    纳林河里流来了水，
    额济纳草原见到了太阳，
    人民有了自由和幸福，
    我们永远感谢毛主席和共产党。
    额旗自纳林河开水以来，水草茂盛，牲畜肥壮，其繁殖率超过过去任何一年，家家都有下双羔的母羊。今年驼毛可产万余斤，羊毛产两万斤。由于人民政府实行贸易自由、等价交换等措施，蒙胞纷纷换回了粮食、布匹、茶、糖及其他日用必需品，过着人畜两旺、安居乐业的生活。优秀的蒙族青年，为剿灭土匪肃清特务，安定牧区治安，已经组成一支人民骑兵。解放了的蒙族人民，誓愿为了祖国将献出自己的一切力量。
