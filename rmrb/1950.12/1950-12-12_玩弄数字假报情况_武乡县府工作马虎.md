    Playing with Numbers and Falsely Reporting Situations
    Careless Work by the Wu乡 County Government

    Editor:
    I work in the Wu乡 County Committee in Shanxi. I have discovered that the county government and the county committee often report different numbers to higher authorities. Especially in this year's autumn plowing summary, the numbers reported by the county government differ greatly from the actual situation. Before the autumn plowing summary, the county committee organized an autumn plowing inspection team in early October. According to the inspection results in 17 villages in the fifth district, all were in varying degrees of laissez-faire. These 17 villages have a total of 43,520 mu of cultivated land, but only 4,320 mu were plowed. This was the worst performing district in autumn plowing. The inspection results of the first and second districts showed that the second district had plowed over 10,000 mu, and the first district nearly 20,000 mu. On October 23rd and 24th, each district convened village cadre meetings by sub-district to redeploy autumn plowing work. Based on the materials, the county committee summarized at the end of the month that a total of 174,450 mu were plowed in the county, accounting for 33% of the county's land. This figure is generally correct. At this time, there were only eight days left until the Beginning of Winter, and autumn plowing had not yet reached half. This was the autumn plowing situation in Wu乡 at the end of October. However, the county government wrote in its comprehensive report for October: "...Autumn plowing has not made great progress. According to incomplete statistics, only over 23,000 mu have been plowed." This differs from the county committee's autumn plowing report to the prefectural committee in October by more than 150,000 mu! This is in no way consistent with the actual situation of autumn plowing in Wu乡 County. Even if the autumn plowing work was completely laissez-faire, it would be more than this number.

    Why did the above situation occur?

    First, the county government often has to prepare monthly and ten-day reports, etc. Because the leading cadres are busy with meetings, they hand them over to the secretary. The secretary does not know enough about the actual situation and is limited by time. In order to complete the task, they take the existing materials at hand to write the report. If there are ten villages, they take the materials from those ten villages; if there is one district, they take the materials from that district. They add up these materials to synthesize the situation of the whole county, and add a sentence in front: "According to incomplete statistics" or "According to incomplete materials." Of course, this kind of material cannot explain the situation of the whole county.

    Secondly, a very serious situation is that whether it is a ten-day report or a monthly report, it is written in advance. Often, the reported numbers for this month are from the previous month, or the first half of the month. For example, the county government wrote in its mid-October report: "According to the districts, the 33 villages in the second district have plowed 2,640 mu." In fact, this was the report before October 10th. However, it was not explained in the report on the 20th. In particular, when writing the summary for the end of the month and the ten-day report, the movement has not yet been completed, and they are summarized as early as ten days ago. This kind of working method is actually a child's play, and it adopts a perfunctory attitude towards the summary and reporting system.

    Finally, the problem of inconsistent reporting numbers should also be examined from both the county committee and the county government. In the past, the county committee office paid attention to exchanging information with various departments, but after the first batch of rectification cadres returned, due to being busy with deploying work, there was less contact with various departments, forming a situation of mutual misunderstanding. Each played with numbers when reporting, which is also an important reason for the inconsistent autumn plowing numbers.

### 玩弄数字假报情况  武乡县府工作马虎

    玩弄数字假报情况
    武乡县府工作马虎编辑同志：
    我在山西武乡县委会工作。我发现我县县府与县委向上级汇报却经常是数字不同。尤其今年秋耕总结中，县府所汇报的数字与实际情况相差极大。县委在秋耕总结之前，十月上旬曾组织了秋耕检查团。据在五区十七个村的检查结果，都处于不同程度的自流状态。十七个村共有耕地四万三千五百二十亩，只耕四千三百二十亩。这是秋耕最差的一个区。检查一、二两区的结果，二区已耕一万余亩，一区近二万亩。各区同于十月二十三、四日，以小区为单位召开了村干部会议，重新布置了秋耕工作。县委根据材料到月底总结时，全县共耕十七万四千四百五十亩，占全县土地的百分之三十三。这个数字大体正确。这时距立冬节气只有八天，秋耕尚未达到一半。这就是十月底武乡的秋耕情况。但是县府在十月份的综合报告中写的是：“……秋耕成绩不大，据不完全统计，已耕二万三千余亩。”这和县委向地委十月份的秋耕汇报，相差十五万余亩！这无论如何是不合乎武乡县秋耕的实际情况的。就是秋耕工作全部自流，也要多于此数。
    为什么产生上述情况呢？
    首先，县府经常要做的月报、旬报等，因为领导干部忙于开会，就交给秘书办理。秘书对实际情况不够了解，又受时间限制，为了完成任务，就把手头现有材料拿来写报告，有十个村就拿十个村的，有一个区就拿一个区的，把这些材料加起来，综合成全县情况，在前面加上一句：“据不完全的统计”或“据不完全的材料”。当然这种材料是不能说明全县情况。
    其次，一个很严重的情况是：不论旬报或月报都是提前写。经常是这月的汇报数字，是上月的，或前半月的。如县府在十月中旬汇报中写道：“秋耕根据各区看来，二区三十三村耕了二千六百四十亩”，实际上这是十月十日前的汇报。但在二十日汇报中并不加以说明。特别是写月终与旬报总结时，运动还没有完成，都早在十天以前总结了。这种工作方法，实际上是一种儿戏，对总结、汇报制度是采取了应付的态度。
    最后，对汇报数字不统一的问题，还应从县委、县府两方面做检查。过去县委办公室与各机关部门交流情况这一点上还是注意了的，但在第一批整风干部回来之后，由于忙于布置工作，对各部门的联系就少了，形成互不了解情况，在汇报时各自玩弄数字，这也是造成汇报秋耕数字不统一的重要原因。
