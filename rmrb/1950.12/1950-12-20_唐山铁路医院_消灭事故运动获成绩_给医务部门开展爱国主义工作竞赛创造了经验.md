    Tangshan Railway Hospital
    Achieves Success in Eliminating Accidents
    Creates Experience for Medical Departments to Carry Out Patriotic Work Competitions
    [Reported by this newspaper] The entire medical staff of Tangshan Railway Hospital, with the remarkable achievement of "eliminating medical accidents and establishing a service-to-workers perspective," welcomes the patriotic production competition. In the two-month campaign to eliminate medical accidents, the hospital cultivated the medical staff's ideology of serving the workers, eliminated accidents, improved the medical system, better protected the health of workers, and improved the relationship between the hospital and the workers. Their actions have created experience for improving medical work and carrying out patriotic work competitions in medical departments.
    After liberation, railway hospitals and clinics in various places still frequently experienced medical liability accidents such as taking the wrong medicine, giving the wrong injections, writing the wrong prescriptions, and delaying diagnosis. Treating workers in this way only made them worse. This irresponsible attitude towards patients has generally aroused dissatisfaction among workers. Based on this situation, the Tianjin Railway Bureau's Health Department called on the railway central hospitals in the Tianjin area in August to eliminate medical liability accidents.
    Under the leadership of President Wang Boshu, Tangshan Railway Hospital, with the hospital as the center, jointly discussed with the four clinics of Qinhuangdao, Guye, Tanggu, and Tangshan Machine Factory, and stipulated specific contents for eliminating accidents: such as doctors should patiently explain to patients; difficult and complicated diseases should be frequently consulted, and diseases that cannot be treated in this hospital should be transferred to other hospitals (Tianjin or Kailuan) in a timely manner, and personnel should be sent to escort them to avoid dangers on the way; "If the pharmacy has medicine, it must have a bottle, and if it has a bottle, it must have a label," the prescription should be read at least twice when dispensing medicine; emergency calls should be dispatched within ten minutes; fire prevention and theft prevention, etc. At the same time, they issued challenges to Tianjin, Fengtai, and Zhangjiakou Railway Hospitals. Tianjin and Fengtai districts responded to the challenge, and the hospital's campaign to eliminate medical accidents began.
    The first stage of the campaign ended on October 25, and the service attitude of the staff in the hospital has undergone significant changes. In the past, Dr. Xu of the Department of Internal Medicine never explained to patients when seeing a doctor, and patients were unwilling to ask him to see them. After the start of the campaign, he patiently explained the symptoms and precautions to patients, and patients were also happy to ask him to see them. The father of a worker suffered from tetanus, and his home was eighteen miles away from Tangshan. Doctors Zheng and Liu went to the emergency call. Because taking the train would delay the time, they often rode bicycles to go. Midwife Mao Jixian of Guye Clinic escorted a patient to Tangshan Hospital and took good care of the patient along the way. She encountered a female passenger who was about to give birth on the train, and she volunteered to deliver the baby, and both the mother and baby were safe. Lao Gao in the pharmacy has been doing dispensing work for twenty-seven years and has always had a blunt attitude towards patients. When patients asked him how to take the medicine, he replied: There are words on the list. When patients asked what the medicine was for, he replied: It treats whatever disease you see. After the start of the campaign, he was afraid that the patients would not understand, and repeatedly told them how to take the medicine.
    Opinion books are hung in front of the departments of the hospital, and a "opinion entrustment" method has been established and handed over to the labor protection committees of factories and sections, which are collected on the 25th of each month and discussed at the meeting of all staff members to find ways to overcome them. In August, they received nine opinions, eight of which expressed dissatisfaction with the doctor's medical treatment. In September, there were no more dissatisfied opinions, and some were constructive and commendatory.
    Since the launch of the campaign to eliminate accidents in the hospital, there has not been a single accident. Since the end of the first stage of the campaign, the second phase of the campaign, which focuses on the rectification of business and the cleaning campaign, has been launched.

    唐山铁路医院
    消灭事故运动获成绩
    给医务部门开展爱国主义工作竞赛创造了经验
    【本报讯】唐山铁路医院的全体医务人员以“消灭医疗事故、树立为职工服务观点”的显著成绩，来迎接爱国主义生产竞赛。该院在两个月的消灭医疗事故运动中，培养了医务人员为职工服务的思想，消灭了事故，改进了医疗制度，更好地保卫了职工的健康，改善了医院与职工的关系。他们的行动对改进医务工作，及在医务部门开展爱国主义工作竞赛创造了经验。
    在解放以后，各地铁路医院或诊疗所仍经常发生拿错药、打错针、开错处方、延误诊断等医疗责任事故。这样给职工治病，就愈治愈坏。这种对病人不负责任的态度，普遍引起职工的不满。根据这种情况，天津铁路局卫生处在八月份号召天津区各铁路中心医院消灭医疗责任事故。
    唐山铁路医院在院长王博书的领导下，以医院为中心，联合秦皇岛、古冶、唐沽、唐山机厂等四诊疗所共同讨论，规定出消灭事故的具体内容：如大夫对病人要耐心解释；疑难病症要经常会诊，本院不能医治的病要及时转院（天津或开滦），并派人护送以免路途发生危险；“药房有药就有瓶，有瓶就有签”，配药时药方至少要看两遍；出诊要在十分钟内出动；防火防盗等等。同时他们向天津、丰台、张家口铁路医院提出挑战书，天津、丰台区应战，医院消灭医疗事故运动就此展开。
    十月二十五日运动第一阶段结束，医院中工作人员的服务态度都有显著的转变。内科徐大夫过去看病，从来不向病人做解释，病人都不愿意叫他看。运动开始后，他对病人耐心解释病状及应注意的问题，病人也很高兴找他看病了。一位工友的父亲患破伤风，他家离唐山十八里路。郑大夫和刘大夫去出诊，因乘火车要拖延时间，多次都是骑自行车去。古冶诊疗所助产士毛继贤去护送病人入唐山医院，一路对病人照顾很好。她在火车上遇到一位女客要临产，就自告奋勇，义务接生，母亲婴儿都得平安。药房老高做配剂工作二十七年，一向对病人态度生硬。病人问他药怎样吃？他回答：单上有字。病人问药治什么病？他回答：你看什么病就治什么病。运动开始后，他唯恐病人不懂，三番四复地告诉他们吃药的方法。
    医院各科门前都挂有意见簿，并建立了“意见委托书”的办法交给厂、段各劳保委员，每月二十五日收回，把职工的意见提在全体工作人员会议上讨论，设法克服。八月份他们收到九条意见，有八条是对大夫医疗上表示不满。九月份不满的意见没有了，有的是建设性的和表扬的意见。
    全院自开展消灭事故运动以来，没有发生过一次事故。自运动第一阶段结束后，已进而开展以整顿业务及整洁运动为中心工作的第二期运动。
