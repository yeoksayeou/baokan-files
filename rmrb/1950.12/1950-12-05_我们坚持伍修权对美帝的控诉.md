    We Insist on Wu Xiuquan's Accusation Against American Imperialism
    Ma Xulun
    Comrade Wu Xiuquan, the special representative attending the United Nations Security Council, expressed the firm will of the 475 million Chinese people against aggression and in defense of peace with righteous and stern words in his accusation against American aggression in China. He ruthlessly exposed and struck at all the conspiracies of the warmongers. The three proposals put forward by Representative Wu Xiuquan in his accusation, and the draft resolution put forward by the Soviet Union regarding American imperialist aggression against Taiwan, are the just demands of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. Anyone with a conscience has no reason to reject them. However, the arrogant American imperialists once again shamelessly used their majority voting machine to openly reject our country's proposal and also the Soviet Union's proposal. This more nakedly exposed to the world the American imperialists' plan to persist in aggression against Chinese territory. They want war, not peace. We express our anger and contempt for this illegal veto by the imperialist aggressor group. We want to solemnly tell the warmongers headed by American imperialism: You are incorrigible, and you must be responsible for all the serious consequences you bring upon yourselves.
    "The Chinese people are fully confident of repelling all imperialists who dare to invade China," "The Chinese people are bound to win final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression." We insist on the accusation made by our representative Wu Xiuquan against American imperialism. We must redouble our efforts and mobilize all our strength to strive for the victory of the anti-aggression struggle.

    我们坚持伍修权对美帝的控诉
    马叙伦
    我出席联合国安全理事会特派代表伍修权对于美国侵略中国的控诉，义正词严地表达了四万七千五百万中国人民反对侵略、保卫和平的坚强意志，无情地揭发并打击了战争贩子们的一切阴谋诡计。伍修权代表在控诉中所提出的三点建议，和苏联提出的关于美帝侵略台湾的决议草案，是中国人民，也是全世界爱好和平人民的正义的要求，凡是稍具心肝的人是没有任何理由可以拒绝的。但是狂妄的美帝竟又一次无耻地运用了它的多数表决器，公然否决了我国的提案，也否决了苏联的提案。这更赤裸裸地向全世界暴露了美帝国主义者坚持侵略中国领土的计划，它要战争，不要和平。我们对帝国主义侵略集团这一非法否决，表示愤怒和蔑视。我们要正告以美帝为首的战争贩子们：你们这样的怙恶不悛，你们得负责你们自己所招致的一切严重后果。
    “中国人民完全有信心打退敢于侵略中国的一切帝国主义者”，“中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争中一定要得到最后胜利”。我们坚持我伍修权代表对美帝的控诉，我们要加倍努力，动员一切力量为争取反侵略斗争的胜利而奋斗。
