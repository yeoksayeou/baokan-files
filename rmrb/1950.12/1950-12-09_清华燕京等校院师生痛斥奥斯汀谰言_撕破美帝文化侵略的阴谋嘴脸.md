    [Report from this newspaper] Teachers and students from Tsinghua University, Yanjing University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Peking Union Medical College, Shanghai St. John's University, Jinan Cheeloo University, and Changsha Xiangya Medical College, among others, have angrily condemned the shameless lies of the United States Permanent Representative to the Security Council, Austin, who on November 28 in the Security Council described the American cultural aggression against China as "friendship between the Chinese and American people," and cited numerous facts to tear apart the ugly face of the American aggressors.

    Professor Ye Qisun, Chairman of the Tsinghua University Council, said: "Austin's speech is all nonsense. What he said is only the fact of American imperialism's aggression against China. The position of us Chinese people is consistent. We have a very clear understanding of American imperialism's aggression and will not be confused by such speeches." Qian Weichang, Dean of Studies, said: "Austin's absurd speech in the Security Council involved Tsinghua University. The history of our school is inseparable from the history of American imperialist cultural aggression in China. Decades ago, American imperialism participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion and plundered the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, forcing the corrupt Qing government to pay reparations. The United States used a tiny fraction of this huge indemnity to set up schools. This is the so-called 'friendship' of American imperialism. The purpose of the U.S. in running Tsinghua was to make us serve their aggressive intentions, but the patriotic actions of Tsinghua students in the 'December 9th' and 'December 1st' movements completely shattered this intention of American imperialism. Today, our teachers and students are bravely participating in the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, which is a powerful answer to American imperialism." Professor Feng Youlan said: "The Boxer Indemnity was loot stolen by the United States from China. Returning the loot to the Chinese people and letting the Chinese run Tsinghua themselves is simply returning the property to its rightful owner. What does it have to do with the United States? Austin's shameless and absurd remarks are a great insult to Tsinghua." Professors Liang Sicheng, Lin Huiyin, and Jin Yuelin jointly denounced: "Today, Austin dares to scold us in the tone of a slave owner towards slaves for forgetting their 'benevolence.' In fact, this is the panicked roar of them seeing the failure of their own cultural aggression! We tens of thousands of intellectuals who have studied different cultures from various countries have a clearer understanding of the狰狞面目 of imperialism, and in order to oppose imperialist aggression, we are uniting to powerfully strike and eliminate it."

    清华燕京等校院师生痛斥奥斯汀谰言
    撕破美帝文化侵略的阴谋嘴脸
    【本报讯】北京清华大学、燕京大学、辅仁大学、协和医学院和上海圣约翰大学、济南齐鲁大学及长沙湘雅医学院等校师生，愤怒斥责美国驻安理会常任代表奥斯汀于十一月二十八日在安理会上将美国对华文化侵略说成“中美人民友谊”的无耻谰言，举出种种事实，撕破美国侵略者的丑恶嘴脸。
    北京清华大学校委会主任委员叶企荪教授说：“奥斯汀的演说是全部胡说。他所讲的只是美帝侵略中国的事实。我们中国人民的立场是一致的，对美帝的侵略认识得很清楚，是不会被这样的演说所迷惑的。”教务长钱伟长说：“奥斯汀在安理会上的荒谬演说中，牵涉到清华大学。我们的学校的历史是和美帝在华的文化侵略的历史分不开的。数十年以前美帝因参加镇压义和团，而掠夺了中国人民的血汗，强迫腐败的满清政府赔了款，美国就把这大宗赔款中的九牛一毛办学校，这就是美帝所谓的‘友谊’。美帝办清华的目的是要我们服务于他们的侵略意图，但是‘一二九’、‘一二一’清华学生的爱国行动彻底粉碎了美帝这种意图，今天我们师生英勇地参加抗美援朝的爱国主义运动，正是对美帝有力的回答。”冯友兰教授说：“庚子赔款是美国从中国抢去的盗赃，把盗赃吐出来交还中国人，中国人自己办清华，不过是物归原主，与美国有什么相干？奥斯汀这种无耻荒谬的言论，是对清华的一个大侮辱。”梁思成、林徽因、金岳霖三教授联名斥责道：“今天奥斯汀竟以奴隶主对待奴隶的口气责备我们忘记他们的“恩惠”，其实，这就是他眼看到他们自己文化侵略失败后的惊惶失措的咆哮！我们数万个学习过各国不同文化的知识分子，更清楚地认识了帝国主义的狰狞面目，并且为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们正在团结起来有力地打击和消灭它。
