The letter stated: You are standing on the front lines of resistance against the American imperialist aggressor troops, unafraid of difficulties and hardships, fighting stubbornly against the American invading army in the freezing cold, quickly defeating the American imperialists' "general offensive," and liberating the city of Pyongyang. We were very happy to hear this news of victory! This victory has further encouraged our training enthusiasm and confidence in defeating American imperialist aggression. Your spirit of bravery in combat and hard struggle is worth learning from. We must strengthen our military studies and improve our skills to be your backup. We wish you more annihilation of the enemy on the basis of victory!
