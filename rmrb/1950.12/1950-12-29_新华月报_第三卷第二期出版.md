One of the central domestic political issues is the liberation of Tibet, with a total of twelve articles on this topic.

The financial and economic section includes "The Ministry of Trade Issues Instructions to Strictly Ban Speculative Commerce," "Decision on the National Bank Supporting Cooperatives," "Preliminary Experience in Autumn Grain Collection in the Central and Southern Regions," "Enthusiastic Payment of Public Grain Throughout the Country," as well as summaries and resolutions from several specialized conferences related to light industry, and "Instructions on Winter Agricultural Production Issued by the Ministry of Agriculture."

There are also four articles on the atomic bomb issue. The Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Philosophy's "Newly Compiled History of Philosophy" continues to be published.

In the literary field, Mao Dun's "Peeling Off the Mask of the 'Masked Bandit'" is a sharp knife that peels off all the beautiful disguises of the United States, leaving only a naked American bandit! "Neighbors" is a very realistic and moving essay. After reading the novel "Monotony," we can clearly see what the American so-called "way of life" is all about. Lenin's "'Pretentious' Heroes" and "In Memory of George Bernard Shaw" are commemorative articles with evaluations of the two great writers Tolstoy and Shaw.

The cover is a color painting by Gu Yuan, and before the main text are inscriptions by government leaders Li Jishen, Zhang Lan, Lin Boqu, and Dong Biwu.
