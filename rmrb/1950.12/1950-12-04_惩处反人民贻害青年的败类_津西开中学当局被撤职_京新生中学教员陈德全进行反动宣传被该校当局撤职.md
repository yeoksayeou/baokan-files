　　Authorities of Tianjin Xikai Middle School Dismissed

　　Chen Dequan, Teacher at Beijing Xinsheng Middle School, Dismissed by School Authorities for Conducting Reactionary Propaganda

[Reported by this newspaper] The authorities of Tianjin Xikai Middle School have consistently harbored hatred towards the people and engaged in reactionary activities, and have been dismissed by the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau. Since liberation, the school authorities have consistently violated the government's educational policies and decrees, continuously engaging in anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-people activities. Furthermore, they have been irresponsible in running the school, misleading young people and children. Recently, during the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, they blatantly carried out deceptive propaganda for the American imperialists, attempting to obscure students' thinking and undermine the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes Movement. Based on this, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau issued an order on November 28th to dismiss the reactionary principal Wang Jiwu, Dean Li Xixiu, teacher Jin Zhaoheng, and clerk Man Jishi. Wei Yuliang, the school's political commissar, was severely criticized and suspended from teaching political science, but was temporarily allowed to continue as a mathematics teacher. Before the school's board of directors is registered, the new principal will be temporarily appointed by the Education Bureau, with Shi Yi succeeding, and Tang Chongshan appointed as Dean. After announcing the above order at a general meeting of teachers and students at the school, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau sent personnel to the school, and the teachers' and students' emotions were extremely high.

The newly appointed principal of the school, Shi Yi, and Dean Tang Chongshan, arrived at the school on November 29th, and were warmly welcomed by all teachers and students. The school's student union also held an executive committee meeting, deciding to establish a branch of the Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression, to lead the entire school in launching the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes Movement.

[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Dequan, a teacher at Beijing Xinsheng Middle School, has been dismissed for conducting reactionary propaganda. Chen Dequan was an English teacher at the school who consistently engaged in reactionary propaganda among the students. This not only affected the students' learning mood, but also directly obscured many students' understanding of the current situation. During the Resist America, Aid Korea period, his reactionary propaganda became even more intensified, and he also threatened students and slandered the leaders of the Central People's Government.

Many students could no longer tolerate Chen Dequan's reactionary propaganda, so they held small accusation meetings, accusing Chen Dequan of his reactionary propaganda. Students from each class recalled the reactionary words Chen Dequan had said in their classes. The students summarized Chen Dequan's malicious propaganda into eight items and twenty-seven points, and held a school-wide teachers and students meeting to ask Chen Dequan to examine the root of his erroneous thinking. However, Chen Dequan not only failed to openly criticize his own absurd behavior at the meeting, but also adopted a tough attitude, which aroused the students' intense emotions. Everyone unanimously believed that Chen Dequan not only could not correctly guide the students, but instead carried out various reactionary propaganda in the school, wantonly creating rumors, and harming young students. The school authorities also believed that Chen Dequan's anti-people stance did not qualify him to be a teacher, and accepted the request of all teachers and students, giving Chen Dequan the punishment of dismissal.

    惩处反人民贻害青年的败类
    津西开中学当局被撤职 
    京新生中学教员陈德全进行反动宣传被该校当局撤职
    【本报讯】天津西开中学校当局一贯仇视人民，进行反动活动，已被天津市教育局撤职。该校当局自解放后，一贯违反政府的教育政策法令，不断的进行反苏反共反人民的活动，并且办学不负责任，贻误青年、儿童，近在抗美援朝运动中，竟公然替美帝进行欺骗宣传，企图模糊同学思想，破坏抗美援朝保家卫国运动。津市教育局据此已于十一月二十八日训令，将反动校长王际五、教导主任李熙修、教员金兆珩、事务员满济世等四人撤职处分。该校政治委员魏玉良除予严厉批评停止政治讲授外，暂准继任数学教员。在该校董事会尚未立案之前，新校长暂由教育局委派史易继任，委唐崇山任教导主任。津市教育局派人在该校全体师生大会上宣布以上训令后，师生情绪极为高涨。
    该校新任校长史易和教导主任唐崇山已于十一月二十九日到校就任，受到全体师生热烈欢迎。该校学生会并召开执委会会议，决定成立保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会支会，领导全校展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    【本报讯】北京市新生中学教员陈德全，因进行反动宣传已被撤职。陈德全是该校英文教员，一贯在学生中进行反动宣传。不但影响同学们的学习情绪，也直接模糊了不少同学对目前形势的认识。在抗美援朝期间，他的反动宣传更变本加厉，并且威胁学生，以及污蔑中央人民政府领袖。
    很多同学对于陈德全的反动宣传忍无可忍，就召开小型控诉会，控诉陈德全的反动宣传，各班同学都想起陈德全在自己班上说过反动的话，学生们把陈德全的恶意宣传综合成八项二十七条，召开全校师生大会，请陈德全检讨他的错误思想根源。但陈德全在大会上非但不开诚批判他自己的荒谬行径，而且态度强硬，因此激起了学生们的激昂情绪。大家一致认为陈德全非但不能正确的指导同学，相反的在校内进行种种反动宣传，恣意制造谣言，贻害青年学生。学校当局亦认为陈德全的反人民立场，不配为人师表，已接受全体师生要求，予陈德全以撤职处分。
