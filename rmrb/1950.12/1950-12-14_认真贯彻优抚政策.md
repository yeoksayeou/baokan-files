    Earnestly Implement Preferential Treatment Policies
    The State Council of the Central People's Government has approved and promulgated five sets of regulations on preferential treatment. These were formulated in accordance with Article 25 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and with reference to the practical experience of preferential treatment work during the land revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation. In the past, these methods were implemented in the old liberated areas and achieved good results in honoring revolutionary martyrs, comforting the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, resettling disabled revolutionary soldiers, and providing compensation for injured and killed militiamen and civilian laborers. They played a significant role in inspiring people, encouraging morale, and consolidating and strengthening the revolutionary forces. Now, under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, the implementation of these methods throughout the country will inevitably make the honoring, preferential treatment, and resettlement of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and injured and killed militiamen and civilian laborers more widespread and thorough. It will also inevitably have a more significant meaning for strengthening national defense construction and enriching and consolidating national defense forces.
    In order to earnestly implement the various preferential treatment regulations, it is first necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth preferential treatment education so that cadres at all levels and the broad masses of people clearly recognize that the reason why the Chinese people were able to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and achieve the great victory of the people's democratic revolution is inseparable from the sacrifices in blood and heroic struggles of countless revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary fighters. They have contributed to the people, and the people should respect and cherish them. The saying often repeated by people in various places, "When drinking water, never forget the well digger," fully expresses the people's deep longing for their liberators. Therefore, the heroic deeds of revolutionary martyrs should be commended, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers should be comforted, disabled revolutionary soldiers should be resettled, and injured and killed militiamen and civilian laborers should be compensated. This is extremely natural.
    To do a good job in preferential treatment work, it should be combined with various tasks (such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, land reform, and production for disaster relief), and through various forms (such as people's representative conferences at all levels, peasant representative conferences, representative conferences of combat heroes and model laborers, representative conferences of disabled revolutionary soldiers, and army-civilian get-togethers), the spirit of army-civilian unity, friendship, and mutual assistance should be highly promoted to create a conscious and voluntary mass movement of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers. "Many hands make light work," and with the joint help of the masses, difficulties can be easily resolved. The government's relief efforts can only play a greater role when combined with mass friendship and mutual assistance. The improvement of the social and political status of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers, as well as the implementation of various preferential treatment measures, should also rely on the mutual assistance of the masses, rather than relying on simple administrative orders. Therefore, any viewpoint or practice that neglects political mobilization and simplifies preferential treatment work into simply distributing preferential treatment grain is obviously wrong.
    The solution to the livelihood and work problems of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers should be viewed from a long-term perspective, mainly by organizing production or introducing employment to help them settle down and establish a career. In rural areas, their main difficulties are the lack of labor and draught animals to cultivate on time, so assistance to them should focus on helping with plowing or plowing on their behalf. Facts have proven that in places where the work of plowing on behalf of or helping with plowing is done well, their difficulties can be appropriately resolved, and fewer problems arise; otherwise, there will be more problems. In cities, efforts should be made to organize them to participate in industrial or sideline production and introduce employment based on local conditions. For example, in the 11th district of Tianjin, 90% of the families of martyrs and soldiers who received in-kind subsidies last year still could not solve their livelihood problems well. This year, by organizing processing factories and introducing employment, the scope of subsidies has been reduced to 19%, and fewer families of martyrs and soldiers are applying for solutions to their difficulties. In addition to organizing convalescent homes for disabled revolutionary soldiers or providing them with sufficient compensation grain to maintain their lives for the small number who have completely lost their ability to work, the rest should be helped as much as possible to make a living or be absorbed into appropriate work, and they should be continuously educated in their work to improve their work ability. Because they have received a certain period of rigorous training in the army, they can play a great role as long as they are used properly and taught according to their aptitude. According to reports from various places, there are already many disabled revolutionary soldiers participating in local militia work or other work, and they generally can complete their tasks well. All agencies, organizations, and enterprises should pay attention to absorbing a certain number of disabled revolutionary soldiers to participate in work, and leading organs at all levels should take the lead in implementing this. Any attitude of prevarication or refusal to hire is a concrete manifestation of irresponsibility to revolutionary soldiers and should be resolutely corrected. If the wounds of disabled revolutionary soldiers recur, all public hospitals should provide free medical treatment. When impoverished families of martyrs and soldiers seek medical treatment from public health agencies, medical expenses should be reduced or waived as appropriate. The enrollment of children of families of martyrs and soldiers should be given appropriate consideration from the quota of publicly funded students.
    Preferential treatment work is a complex and meticulous organizational work. Although the various preferential treatment regulations have made unified provisions on general principles, when implementing them, it is necessary to create more practical methods based on local conditions to prevent the tendency of mechanically applying the provisions. Taking plowing on behalf of as an example, some areas implement large-scale contract plowing, some areas implement small-scale contract plowing, and some areas have implemented unified labor planning at the district and township level due to the large disparity in the number of families of martyrs and soldiers. This spirit of handling affairs based on specific circumstances should be promoted. However, some areas, regardless of whether the families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers have labor and draught animals, and without conducting necessary production education for them, simply stipulate that all will be plowed on behalf of, fostering egalitarianism and wasting civilian labor. This practice of not handling affairs based on specific circumstances should be avoided as much as possible.
    Preferential treatment work is an important task of people's governments at all levels, and it is also a regular task. People's governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership over this work, conduct in-depth guidance and inspection frequently, and truly understand the production and employment of families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers. At present, the competent authorities in various places, especially the old revolutionary base areas with a large number of families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers, should conduct a comprehensive investigation and study, and then formulate appropriate handling methods based on different situations. It is necessary to resolutely overcome the bureaucratic work style of letting things take their own course, and also to prevent the tendency of coercion, commandism, and rushing things. Only in this way can preferential treatment work be done well, so that the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and disabled revolutionary soldiers can all be properly settled.

### 认真贯彻优抚政策

    认真贯彻优抚政策
    中央人民政府政务院批准公布了五项关于优抚的条例。这是根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第二十五条的规定，并参照土地革命战争、抗日战争及解放战争时期优抚工作的实际经验而制定的。过去在革命战争中，在老解放区实行了这些办法，在褒恤革命烈士、安抚革命烈军属、安置革命残废军人、抚恤伤亡民兵民工等方面曾收到了很好的效果，对于鼓舞人心，鼓励士气，巩固与壮大革命部队起了很大的作用。现在在中央人民政府统一领导下，在全国范围实行这些办法，对于革命烈士、革命烈军属、革命残废军人、伤亡民兵民工的褒恤、优抚、安置等方面必然会做得更加普遍而周密，对于国防建设的加强，国防力量的充实与巩固，也必然会有更加重大的意义。
    为了认真执行各项优抚条例，首先必须进行广泛深入的优抚教育，使各级干部及广大人民明确认识中国人民所以能够打倒帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，取得人民民主革命的伟大胜利，是与无数革命先烈革命战士的流血牺牲，英勇战斗分不开的。他们有功于人民，人民应当尊敬他们，爱护他们。各地人民常说的“吃水忘不了淘井的人”这句话，充分表现了人民对自己的解放者的深挚怀念。因此，革命烈士的英勇事迹应该得到褒扬，革命烈军属应该得到安抚，革命残废军人应该得到安置，伤亡民兵民工应该得到抚恤。这是极当然的。
    要做好优抚工作，应结合各种工作（如剿匪、反霸、减租、土改、生产救灾等），通过各种形式（如各界人民代表会、农民代表会、战斗英雄劳动模范代表会、革命残废军人代表会、军民联欢会等），高度发扬军民一家、友爱互助的精神，造成自觉自愿的群众性的优军优属运动。“大家拾柴火焰高”，群众合力帮助，困难便好解决。政府的救济力量，只有结合群众性的友爱互助，才能发挥更大作用。而烈军属及革命残废军人社会政治地位的提高及各种优抚办法的实现，也只有依靠群众的互助，而不应依靠单纯的行政命令。因此，任何忽视政治动员而把优抚工作简化为单纯发优抚粮的观点与作法，显然是错误的。
    对于革命烈军属、革命残废军人的生活、工作等问题的解决，应从长期着眼，主要的是组织生产或介绍职业，帮助其安家立业。在农村，他们的主要困难是缺乏劳力畜力不能按时耕作，因此对他们的帮助应以帮耕或代耕为主。事实证明，凡是代耕或帮耕工作做的好的地方，他们的困难便可适当解决，发生的问题就少，否则，问题就多。在城市中，应依据当地情况从组织他们参加工业或副业生产和介绍职业着手。如天津十一区去年享受实物补助的烈军工属达百分之九十，生活问题依然不能很好解决，今年用组织加工工厂和介绍职业的方法，使补助面缩小到百分之十九，烈军工属申请解决困难的反而少了。对革命残废军人除少数完全丧失劳作能力的应组织革命残废军人教养院或给以足够的抚恤粮以维持其生活外，其余应尽可能帮助其谋生立业或吸收其参加适当的工作，并应在工作中不断给以教育，以提高其工作能力。由于他们曾经在部队中受过一定时期的严格训练，只要用得其当，并因材施教，是可以发挥很大作用的。根据各地报告，革命残废军人参加地方民兵工作或其他工作的，已经不少，一般都能很好地完成任务。各机关团体及企业部门应注意吸收一定数量的革命残废军人参加工作，各级领导机关尤应首先执行。任何借词推托或拒绝录用的态度，是对革命军人不负责任的具体表现，应坚决加以纠正。如有革命残废军人伤口复发，各公立医院应予以免费医疗。贫苦烈军属到公共卫生机关治病时应酌情减免医药费。烈军属子弟的入学问题应就公费生名额中予以适当照顾。
    优抚工作是一个复杂细致的组织工作，各项优抚条例虽然已把一般原则作了统一规定，但执行时必须依据当地具体情况，创造更多的切合实际的办法，防止机械搬用条文的偏向。以代耕为例，有的地区实行大包耕，有的地区实行小包耕，有的地区则因烈军属数目悬殊很大而实行了以区乡为单位的劳力统筹。这种依据具体情况办事的精神是应该提倡的。但有的地区不问烈军属及革命残废军人有无劳力畜力，也不向他们进行必要的生产教育，只简单地规定一律代耕，助长了平均主义，浪费了民力。这种不依据具体情况办事的作法是应该极力避免的。
    优抚工作是各级人民政府的一项重要工作，同时也是一项经常性的工作。各级人民政府应加强对这一工作的领导，要经常进行深入的指导与检查，要确实了解烈军属革命残废军人的生产就业等情况。目前各地主管机关，尤其是烈军属及革命残废军人较多的老区，即应作一通盘的调查研究，然后依据不同的情况，定出妥善的处理办法。要坚决克服放任自流的官僚主义作风，也要防止强迫命令、突击包办的偏向。只有这样，才能把优抚工作做好，使革命烈军属和革命残废军人各得其所。
