    The Fascistization of American Culture
    Zhu Li
    We know that the United States is ruled by a tiny minority of monopoly capitalists, such as Morgan and DuPont. They not only control the economic and political means of land, factories, government, military, police, and laws to exploit and oppress the people, but also manipulate almost all radio stations, the film industry, newspapers, publishing houses, schools... to deceive and numb the people. Let us take a look at the true face of American culture and the American cultural circles.

    I. Persecution of Progressive Cultural and Educational Workers

    The American reactionaries unscrupulously persecute progressive cultural and educational workers at home, stifling all progressive cultural ideas and preventing the people from seeing a ray of light. Let's take a few of the most familiar examples. As early as 1947, ten Hollywood writers were persecuted by the fascist organization "Un-American Activities Committee." Recently, two of them, Lauttson and Trumbo, were sent to prison. The fascists hated them because they wrote film scripts about the struggle of Republican Spain against the fascist Franco, and because they brought life and vitality into the rotten American film industry. Fast, a famous novelist and one of the leaders of the anti-fascist committee, was also imprisoned. His books vividly depicted the historical facts of the class struggle in the United States since its founding, piercing the hypocrisy of the reactionaries like a sharp blade. In addition, the fascists also took action to sabotage the concert held by the great black singer Robeson in Peektown, New York State, last fall, injuring hundreds of audience members.

    Educators are also being persecuted, and many university professors have been unreasonably dismissed for "ideological problems." In May of last year, eight leaders of the New York City Teachers Union were forcibly dismissed by the Board of Education. New York State also passed the reactionary Feinberg Law, stating that no communist is allowed to teach. With this law, any teacher can lose the freedom to teach after being labeled a communist.

    The fascists also have a despicable practice of large-scale "purging" of the cultural circles, especially the radio broadcasting industry. In 1947, three people who had served as "Federal Bureau of Investigation" agents organized a "American Business Consultants" company specializing in selling blacklists, and published a bulletin called "Counterattack." The publication specifically stated that a certain radio playwright was a "red element," and that a certain singer was a "fellow traveler," etc., and instigated employers to dismiss them. Sometimes they also blackmailed radio company managers, saying that there were "communist elements" in the company and they must be funded to review all personnel. As long as "Counterattack" publishes any blacklist, Hearst's newspapers, the Catholic Church, and the American Legion will respond by barking madly at these "red elements." The number of people attacked is countless, including progressive and non-progressive individuals. What the fascists want is to create a black darkness of fascist terror throughout the country.

    II. War Propaganda and Anti-Soviet, Anti-Communist Clamor

    Propagating war and anti-Soviet, anti-communist fascist ideology has become the central content of American culture. All other extremely corrupt and degenerate ideologies, such as materialism, pornography, mysticism, and other "special products" of decadent capitalist society, are combined with this fascist ideology. The expression of spreading this vicious ideology is: Rumors, slander, vilification, and intimidation!

    This kind of propaganda and clamor is the "ideological mobilization" made by the reactionaries to the people, attempting to make the American people not oppose the war of aggression, not oppose the huge military expenditure and all other measures of replacing butter with guns, and even willing to be cannon fodder. The war-mongers want to use rumors to cover up their robber face precisely because of the growth of the world's peace forces and the American people's love of peace. The most direct result of the war-mongers creating war hysteria was the suicide of former Secretary of Defense Forrestal, a war-monger himself, by jumping off a building! And America's peace forces continue to grow there.

    Bookstores are filled with poisonous "works," including the "creations" of politicians, hooligans, and soldiers who are anti-Soviet and anti-communist, as well as a large number of "refugees" who have sold their souls, gathered by the reactionaries, exiles from various countries' counter-revolutions, Trotskyites, and "works" by communist traitors, etc. They praise the "works" such as "repentant" autobiographies written by Trotskyite agents, and award the Pulitzer Prize to one of these vulgar people, Woolte, as a commendation. They also touted Budenz, the communist traitor who testified falsely for the "Un-American Activities Committee" during the trial of the twelve American communist leaders, as a model for American youth! They also plan to insert this group of accomplices and lackeys into various positions in the cultural publishing industry, as editors, literary critics, publishers, writers... to carry out activities such as buying off, enticing, coercing, sabotaging, and spreading rumors!

    III. Worship of Beasts, Praise of Violence

    American culture has degenerated to the point of worshiping beasts, praising violence, bestiality, and fascist anti-humanism.

    This ideological consciousness of worshiping beasts has widely penetrated the reading materials of the general public. The central figure in children's comic strips, the well-known "Superman," is actually a super beast. It has a special mysterious power and does whatever it wants, and this "Superman" is the hero in the minds of many American children.

    Detective novels, movies, and radio programs are filled with terrifying and mysterious plots and stories of rape, murder, robbery, and murder for money. Just listening to the names of these films, such as: "Born to Kill"; "Murder My Sweet, Dear Dillinger," one can imagine what their content is like.

    This ideology of worshiping violence is also combined with shameless anti-Soviet and anti-communist propaganda. For example: In 1946, the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine's award was given to Head for writing a story called "American President, Great Detective." This is a cruel story about the mystery of the atomic bomb, roughly saying that in 1977, "the head of the Mongol Empire (the Soviet Union has become a part of the empire)" and the American president competed in intelligence. The American president was a great detective with both talent and wisdom, so he detected the conspiracy of the "Di people" and preemptively dropped the atomic bomb, destroying the "Mongol Empire"; at the same time, another new land appeared on the changed face of the earth, and the President pompously sealed this land as "part of the United States." What a despicable and vile "mystery story"!

    Children are deeply poisoned by this cruel and barbaric ideology. They imitate all kinds of animal behavior and commit all kinds of crimes. Newspapers have reported such incidents: A child killed all his family members, including his father, mother, younger brother, and younger sister. When the police questioned him why he did this, he said: "I just felt like killing someone." No wonder university educational psychologists boast about absurd theories, saying that there are two "drives" in human nature, one of which is the "drive" to harm people. The American reactionaries are intentionally cultivating the ideological consciousness of worshiping beasts, because they are trying to transfer the people's dissatisfaction with society (which is the result of their crimes) to the vent of cruel and barbaric fascist behavior.

    美帝文化的法西斯化
    朱理
    我们知道，统治美国的是摩根、杜邦等极少数独占资本家。他们不但控制着土地、工厂、政府、军队、警察、法律等经济政治手段，用以剥削与压迫人民，同时还操纵了几乎是全部的无线电台，电影业，报纸，出版业，学校……，用以欺骗和麻醉人民。让我们来看看美国文化和美国文化界的真面目吧。
    一、迫害进步的文化教育工作者
    美国反动派对国内进步的文化教育工作者进行无耻的迫害，窒息一切进步的文化思想，让人民见不到一丝光明。顺手举几个最熟习的例子吧。早在一九四七年，好莱坞的十位作家，就遭到法西斯组织“非美活动委员会”的迫害。最近其中的两位，劳特逊与特伦波被送入监狱。法西斯分子忌恨他们，因为他们写了共和西班牙反法西斯佛朗哥斗争的一些电影剧本，因为他们将生命与活力带进腐臭了的美国电影业。反法西斯委员会负责人之一、著名的小说家法斯脱也被关进了监狱。他的一本本著作都生动有力地描画了美国建国以来阶级斗争的史实，像利刃一样刺破反动派的虚伪面目。此外，法西斯分子还大打出手，破坏伟大黑人歌唱家罗伯逊于去年秋天在纽约州皮镇举行的音乐会，数百观众受了伤。
    教育工作者同样受着迫害，许多大学教授因“思想问题”被无理解聘。去年五月间，纽约市教师工会八位负责人硬被教育局开除。纽约州又曾经通过反动的佛安柏格法案，书明不许共产党员执教。有了这法案，任何教师都可以在被指为共产党员后，失去教书的自由。
    法西斯分子还有一种大规模“肃清”文化界特别是无线电广播业的卑贱做法，有三个当过“联邦调查局”特务的人，在一九四七年组织了一个专门贩卖黑名单的“美国商业顾问”公司，出版名叫“反攻”的通报，该刊物专门登载某无线电剧作家是“赤色分子”，某歌星又是“同路人”等，并唆使雇主将他们解雇。有时他们还敲诈广播公司经理，说公司内有“共产党分子”，必须出资让他们将所有人员审查一番。只要“反攻”一登出什么黑名单，赫斯脱系的报纸，天主教会，美国军团都会响应着向这些“赤色分子”狂吠，被攻击的人多到数不清，包括进步与不进步的。法西斯分子所要的就是在全国造成法西斯恐怖的一片漆黑。
    二、战争宣传与反苏反共叫嚣
    宣传战争与反苏反共的法西斯思想，已成为美帝文化的中心内容。其他一切极腐化堕落的思想意识，如拜金主义、色情狂、神秘主义等没落资本主义社会的“特产”，都与这法西斯思想结合起来。散布这种恶毒思想的表现手法就是：造谣，毁谤，诬蔑和恫吓！
    这种宣传与叫嚣都是反动派对人民所作的“思想动员”，企图使美国人民不反对侵略战争，不反对压在身上的庞大军费及其他一切用大炮代替牛油的措施，甚至肯去当炮灰。战争贩子们所以要用造谣来掩盖它的强盗面目，正是因为世界和平力量的壮大与美国人民对和平爱好的缘故。战争贩子制造战争歇斯底里最直接的结果，就是战争贩子前国防部长福莱斯特自己的跳楼自杀！而美国的和平力量还是继续在那里生长。
    书店里充塞着有毒的“作品”，有政客、流氓、军人反苏反共的“创作”，还有反动派搜罗来的大批出卖了灵魂的“难民”，各国反革命的流亡分子，托派分子，以及共产党叛徒等等的“作品”。他们歌颂托派特务所著“悔过”的自传等“作品”，将蒲力兹文艺奖金赏给这批下流东西中的一个吴而脱门，以资表扬。他们并且把那个在审判美共十二领袖时，为“非美活动委员会”作伪证的共产党叛徒布登兹，捧为美国青年的模范！还有计划地将这批帮凶与走狗插入文化出版界的各个岗位上，做编辑、文艺批评家、出版家、作家……以进行收买、利诱、威迫、破坏、造谣等勾当！
    三、崇拜禽兽，歌颂暴力
    美国文化已经堕落到如此地步，以致崇拜禽兽，歌颂暴力、兽行，以及法西斯的反人道主义。
    这种对禽兽崇拜的思想意识广泛地渗入一般人民的读物中，儿童连环图画的中心人物，老少皆知的“超人”，实在就是一头超级的禽兽。它有着一种特殊的神秘力量，随心所欲地干着各种他所想干的事，而这“超人”是许多美国儿童心目中的英雄。
    侦探小说、电影以及无线电节目中布满了强奸、谋杀、抢劫、谋财害命等恐怖神秘的情节与故事。只要听听这种电影片子的名字如：《生来为杀人》；《谋杀我心爱的狄琳格》，就可以想像其内容为何如了。
    这种崇拜暴行的思想形态又与无耻的反苏反共的宣传结合起来。举一个例子：一九四六年埃勒莱皇后神秘杂志公司的奖金是给予写一篇名叫《美国总统，大侦察》的赫德的。这是一篇残忍的讲原子弹的神秘故事，大意说，在一九七七年“蒙古帝国（苏联已成该帝国的一部分）的元首”与美国总统斗智，美国总统是一位大侦探，才智双全，于是探得了“狄人”的阴谋而先发制人地投下了原子弹，消灭了“蒙古帝国”；同时，在改变了的地球面上出现了另一新土地，大总统就冠冕堂皇地封这块土地为“美国的一部分”。这是多么卑贱恶劣的“神秘故事”！
    儿童受到这种残忍的野蛮思想的毒素是非常深的。他们模仿着一切禽兽的行为，犯着各种各样的罪。报上曾经发表过这样的事：有一个小孩将父亲、母亲、弟妹等，全家人都杀光。当警察盘问他为什么如此做，他说：“我就觉得要杀人。”无怪乎大学教育心理学家吹嘘着不通的理论，说人本性中有两种“动力”（drive），其中之一就是想害人的“动力”。美国反动派是有意地在培养对禽兽崇拜的思想意识，因为他们企图把人民对社会的不满（这是他们罪行的结果）转移到残忍野蛮的法西斯行为的发泄上去。
