Beijing First Prize-Linked Savings Lottery Drawing
	First Prize—089151045549
The first prize-linked fixed deposit savings lottery held by the Beijing Municipal People's Bank was drawn publicly yesterday (the 17th) at 1:00 PM at the Democratic Theater. The first prize numbers were 089151 (first group) and 045549 (second group). Representatives from the Central People's Government Financial and Economic Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Municipal People's Court, and other organizations were present to supervise the drawing. More than 1,300 people, including representatives from mass organizations and depositors, attended to observe. Before the drawing, Yin Yukun, Deputy Director of the Municipal People's Bank, delivered a speech. He explained that the People's Bank's organization of prize-linked savings was in accordance with Article 37 of the Common Program, which states that "the People's Government should take necessary measures to encourage people's savings," using appropriate incentives to further increase the savings interest of the broad masses of people and cultivate good habits of thrift. After the state concentrates the people's scattered funds, it invests them in undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, which can accelerate the country's economic construction and strengthen national power. Subsequently, the bank's staff reported the lottery procedures in detail, and then invited two students from the Normal University to draw the numbers. Six depositor representatives, including Jin Huizhen, were invited to the stage to supervise the drawing. The drawing was conducted in two groups, first and second. Winners can redeem their prizes with their deposit slips starting from the 22nd of this month. First, second, third, and consolation prizes must be claimed at the Savings Department of the bank at Guanyinsi in the Front Gate area. Fourth and last prizes can be claimed at the bank's various branch offices. The winning numbers can be found in the advertisement column of this newspaper (in case of errors, the official number announcement posted in front of the bank shall prevail).
