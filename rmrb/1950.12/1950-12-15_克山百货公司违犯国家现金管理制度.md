    Keshan Department Store Violates National Cash Management System
    To the Editor:
    On November 16th, the Keshan Office of the Northeast Bank, in accordance with the provisions of the national cash management system, inspected the accounts of the Keshan County Department Store and found that the company had paid 14 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below) in cash when buying coal from the Coal Construction Company, and 9,786,000 yuan in cash for telephone bills and stamps from the Post and Telecommunications Bureau. Both the Coal Construction Company and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau are units implementing cash management and should have used transfer payments. Furthermore, on November 15th, the company's internal cash on hand was 11,254,200 yuan, exceeding the prescribed limit (according to regulations, only 10 million yuan in cash can be held internally each day). In addition, the company's cash income from automobile transportation in September was 43 million yuan, more than four times the prescribed limit, which was neither recorded in the accounts nor deposited in the bank.
    The accounts of the Keshan Department Store are also chaotic and frequently interrupted. Department stores are important national enterprise departments, and cash accounts should be settled and recorded daily. However, the company's cash account was once interrupted for half a month at the longest period.
    Based on the above situation, the Keshan Office of the Northeast Bank has repeatedly put forward specific improvement suggestions, but the responsible comrades of the company have not paid sufficient attention. This serious phenomenon of non-compliance with the national cash management system and unclear accounts is very detrimental to the country and the people and should be given serious attention.

### 克山百货公司违犯国家现金管理制度

    克山百货公司违犯国家现金管理制度编辑同志：
    东北银行克山办事处在十一月十六日，按照国家现金管理制度的规定，检查了克山县百货公司的账目，发现该公司买煤建公司的煤炭时，付给现金一千四百万元（东北币，下同），付给邮电局电话费及邮票现金九百七十八万六千元，而煤建公司及邮电局均为实行现金管理的单位，均未按照转账方式办理。又该公司十一月十五日内部库存现金为一一、二五四、二○○元，超过了规定限度（按规定每日内部只能结存现金一千万元）。另外该公司九月份的汽车运输收入现金四三、○○○、○○○元，超过规定限度的四倍多，既未上账，也未送存银行。
    克山百货公司账目也很混乱，且经常有间断的情形。百货公司是国家的重要企业部门，现金账应该每天结记。但该公司的现金账在最长的时期内曾经间断过半月。
    根据上述情况，东北银行克山办事处曾多次提出具体改进意见，但该公司负责同志，总未引起很好重视。这种不遵守国家现金管理制度，账目不清的严重现象，对国家对人民都是很不利的，应引起严重注意。
