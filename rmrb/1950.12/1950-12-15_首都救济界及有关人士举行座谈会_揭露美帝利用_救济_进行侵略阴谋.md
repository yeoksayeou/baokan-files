[Report from this newspaper] On November 28th, Austin's absurd speech in the Security Council, involving the US's "relief materials" and "relief" for the Chinese people, was solely intended to cover up the fact that US imperialism used "relief" for aggressive conspiracies. Relief circles and relevant personnel in the capital held a symposium on this issue on December 6th at the China People's Relief General Association. Attendees included Peng Zemin, Xie Juezai, Wu Yunfu, Situ Meitang, Zhao Puchu, Shu Sheyu (Lao She), Lei Jieqiong, Wu Jingchao, Fang Yu Yan, Xiong Jinding, Guan Ruiwu, Liu Qingyang, Gu Jinxin, Liu Jiangwen, Hu Lansheng, Liao Mengxing, Guan Datong, Zhang Yuanshan, Shen Yuanhui, Chou Zigang, Xie Bangding (Du Baisou substituting), Chen Shunyi, Qu Yuan, Yu Ruqi, Du Bo, and more than 30 others, and the discussion was extremely enthusiastic.

    Xiong Jinding:
    The Chinese people have always been self-reliant and do not rely on foreign aid. US imperialism, under the guise of "relief" with "surplus materials," infiltrated China to carry out destructive work.
    The Chinese people have always been self-reliant and do not rely on foreign aid. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" that it is naive to think that we need the assistance of the British and American governments. Vice Premier Dong Biwu also pointed out in his report "The Relief and Welfare Undertakings of New China" that US imperialism's clamoring for "relief" has ulterior motives. The imperialists want to use the name of "relief" to infiltrate China and carry out destructive work. US imperialism's "relief materials" are their "surplus materials," especially "military surplus materials." For example, among the 824 boxes of "relief materials" shipped to the Liberated Areas by the United Nations Children's Fund, which was manipulated by US imperialism, there were actually 304 boxes of toilet paper and dozens of boxes of DDT sprayers. The fact that the US conducted "relief" in China also shows that those who truly received "relief" from the US were not the people, but the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, bureaucratic capitalists like T.V. Soong, bandits, secret agents, etc. The reactionary government used "relief materials" as capital for fighting the civil war. Even now, canned milk can be seen flooding the markets in Beijing and Tianjin, which are the American "relief materials" dumped on the market by Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalists.
    Peng Zemin:
    US imperialism manipulated the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to monopolize rice prices, causing the common people to starve, which is even worse than killing people with knives.
    The southern provinces of our country were originally rice-producing areas, but reactionary rule caused insufficient rural production, so they relied on the import of rice from Vietnam, Siam, and other countries. US imperialism then manipulated UNRRA to monopolize rice prices in Vietnam, Siam, and other countries. The import rice prices were all controlled by UNRRA, thereby exploiting the Chinese people. At that time, the price of rice in Hong Kong was several times higher than usual, causing workers in Hong Kong to strike because they could not make a living, and the same was true in other parts of the South. If the common people didn't buy it, they would have to go hungry, which is even worse than killing people with knives.
    Wu Yunfu:
    US imperialism violated the principle of non-discrimination, manipulated UNRRA, and allocated slightly less than 2% of the materials to the Liberated Areas, which accounted for three-fifths of the disaster-stricken population. This is the actual situation of the so-called "relief to the Chinese people."
    UNRRA touted the principle of non-discrimination, but it did not do so when implementing the principle. The disaster-stricken people in the Liberated Areas, who suffered the most from the enemy's "three-all policy" during the War of Resistance Against Japan, numbered 26 million, accounting for three-fifths of the 42 million disaster-stricken people in the country at that time. They should have received three-fifths of the "relief materials," but US imperialism, which manipulated UNRRA, only allocated slightly less than 2% of the materials. From this, we can know the actual situation of what Austin called "relief to the Chinese people." US imperialism obtained countless privileges from Chiang Kai-shek in exchange for so-called "relief." This kind of "relief" is a conspiracy to use small shrimp to catch carp.
    Liu Qingyang:
    In addition to aiding Chiang Kai-shek, US imperialism distributed a little bit of residue to the people to buy their souls, which deceived some people.
    US imperialism used "relief" to carry out a lot of propaganda to numb and deceive the people. In addition to aiding Chiang Kai-shek, it distributed a little bit of residue to the people to buy their souls. At that time, the mayor of Beijing personally carried 200 jin of American flour to the train station and transported it to a car, and then publicized extensively how the United States was helping and how the mayor loved the people. But who bombed our people and then came to "relieve" us? This kind of deception is really outrageous. In China, such as Beijing, professors at various universities received two bags of flour, and students also drank milk, but after the Shen Chong incident, many professors and students angrily threw away these things that insulted the Chinese people. However, there are indeed some backward elements who still believe in their deception. Today, we should recognize that only the Chinese people can save themselves. In the past two years of floods, the people's government has carried out a continuous stream of relief efforts. This year's flood did not inundate Tianjin, which is due to the efforts of the people themselves.
    Shen Yuanhui:
    US imperialism wore a mask of "cooperation" with us and used the "experts" it sent to China to carry out reactionary propaganda.
    I co-organized a health personnel training class with US imperialism. First of all, it put forward very high conditions, requiring American-style houses and equipment, and a lot of extravagance, which cost us a lot of money. The so-called American "experts" took this opportunity to try to create their own set of health organizations, not subject to the leadership of the people's government, and even used this plan to promote that all health personnel in the Chinese Liberated Areas were trained by the United States. At the same time, they used petty favors to win over students and create disunity, distributing biscuits issued by the school to residents to publicize the "charity" of US imperialism. They taught students with impractical teaching materials, and when we were studying "The History of Social Development," they distributed pamphlets to students on "God Creating Man." The "relief materials" they provided were also not applicable. A delivery package required two people to carry, and it contained saline and soapy water, and outdated medicines that we dared not use. This proves that they were all "surplus materials." They "cooperated" with us in this way while wearing a mask, and we should expose them.
    Xie Juezai:
    The United States has so many unemployed workers who are not provided with relief, but they burn wheat and pour milk into the sea. Why would they suddenly care about the Chinese people thousands of miles away?
    Imperialism is calculating two methods of aggression in its own calculations: one method is the "relief materials," running schools, the Marshall Plan, and the Fourth Point Plan that Austin mentioned; the other method is to use bombs, super-fortresses, and atomic bombs to "maintain world security" and "protect democratic systems." Two methods, one purpose: that is, how to rule the people, seeing which one is more profitable and less troublesome, and then doing it. US imperialism uses "relief materials" to "help people," causing others' production to collapse, making people think that American goods are good and Americans are good, but the United States has so many unemployed workers domestically, but they burn wheat and pour milk into the sea. Why would they suddenly care about the Chinese people thousands of miles away? Today, the people are not anesthetized and not deceived, so it will not do it, and it will use atomic bombs. This can be regarded as "the dagger is revealed when the map is exhausted." When exploiters and oppressors reach this point, there is no talk of "charity" and "conscience." What "charity" is there in the US bombing peaceful residents in Korea? True "relief" only exists in a society without exploitation and oppression.
    Lei Jieqiong:
    US imperialism wanted to use "relief" to prevent our revolution from succeeding, to "win back the hearts of the Chinese people," and to use relief agencies to win over intellectuals, causing them to lose the national self-esteem of the Chinese people.
    US imperialism's "relief" is intended to prevent the success of our revolution. The "United China Relief" used the slogan "Donate one more dollar, and you will prevent the development of communism by one more point" as a slogan for soliciting "relief funds," and also wanted to use relief agencies for intelligence work. Just because I ran a children's welfare undertaking, those who inquired about intelligence came one after another. US imperialism's "relief" has a great impact on Chinese intellectuals. Many intellectuals do not engage in undertakings to serve the people, but are attracted to the huge UNRRA. Some people run charitable undertakings also to strive to go to the United States and win over Americans. American-style "relief" has thus caused the Chinese people to lose their national self-esteem. US imperialism also wanted to use "relief" to win the hearts of the Chinese people. An American named Zhou Yide came to Yenching University, and I was very "honored" to have dinner with him. He asked how the United States should "help" China. He admitted that Chiang Kai-shek was helpless, and he asked "whether relief can be used to win back the hearts of the Chinese people." From this, I have realized what US imperialism's "relief" is.
    Wu Jingchao:
    US imperialism created a great disaster in China and then gave a small "relief." Without US imperialism's "relief," so many people in China would not have starved to death.
    In 1946, I saw in Hubei that the United States transported flour to Hankou and then transported it to Laohekou, which was very uneconomical. If the price of selling one ton of flour in Hankou could buy two and a half tons in Laohekou, more people could be relieved, but UNRRA refused to do so and insisted on directly transporting American flour to Laohekou so that the common people would know that this was American "relief materials" in order to carry out propaganda to buy people's hearts. Some so-called UNRRA experts had complicated procedures when distributing flour. Before distribution, they even had to investigate and register how much grain, beef, pork, and eggs each disaster-stricken family had stored. Isn't this a joke! As a result, the "relief grain" was not distributed, and I don't know how many people had already starved to death. US imperialism created a great disaster in China in this way and then gave a small "relief." Without US imperialism's "relief," so many people in China would not have starved to death.
    Zhao Puchu:
    US imperialism's "relief" policy is to realize its bloody aggression. We must further awaken the people to recognize US imperialism and eliminate muddled thinking.
    Last spring, I received a batch of materials from the US Economic Cooperation Administration in Shanghai. The director of the administration's Shanghai office, Saint Louis, stated that the materials could be handed over, but they must be handed over through a trusteeship committee composed of three foreign church relief organizations, abide by their rules, and be subject to their control, requiring our highest authorities and the Shanghai Military Control Commission to provide written guarantees that they would not interfere with these materials. We refused and reported it to the Military Control Commission, which ordered it to be taken over. This proves that US imperialism has no real "relief" and no real "charity." US imperialism's "relief" policy is to steal sovereignty in China and realize its bloody aggression. Over the past hundred years, the poison of imperialism has been deeply rooted in the minds of the average person in China. We must expose its conspiracy, awaken the people to recognize US imperialism, and eliminate muddled thinking.
    Zhang Yuanshan:
    The "relief materials" that the United States gave us in the past are equivalent to atomic bombs and artillery.
    Austin still thinks today that the Chinese people can be deceived. Some people used to think that their "relief" was the spirit of Christianity, but now they know that even religion has been used by them as a tool of aggression. The "relief materials" that the United States gave us in the past are equivalent to atomic bombs and artillery. Austin's speech is a confession without being forced.
    Shu Sheyu:
    The Chinese people have never "begged for pity" from US imperialism.
    Austin thinks that although his speech will not be accepted by the Chinese people, he believes that it will be accepted by Americans and the countries controlled by the United States in the United Nations, making them think that the Chinese people are "ungrateful." US imperialism wants to create a psychology of pride in Americans and contempt for the Chinese people, constantly saying that China is only poor and broken and must "beg for pity" from the United States. In fact, US imperialism's "help" only helped Chiang Kai-shek and obtained Chiang Kai-shek's "obedience" and special "friendship." Now the Chinese government is the people's revolutionary government. The Chinese people have never "begged for pity" from US imperialism, and now they will not "beg for pity" from US imperialism even more. Austin's entire speech only illustrates the relationship between the US government and Chiang Kai-shek, not the relationship between the American people and the Chinese people.
    Guan Ruiwu:
    I used to think that a certain "relief" official in the United States was a friend of China, but now I have recognized it clearly.
    I had the opportunity to work in a United Nations agency for children's welfare work. At that time, I thought that Elles, the North China representative of the UN Children's Fund, seemed to be very loyal to China. Later, I saw many consultants writing letters back to the United States, only saying how good the enjoyment was, how they enjoyed the treatment of double salary, and how good the results of the talks were. In fact, these people were doing some useless work in China, but the United Nations was controlled by US imperialism. Now that it has been exposed, I have recognized it clearly. We should not let the United Nations become a tool controlled by US imperialism.
    Yu Ruqi:
    US imperialism distributed "relief materials" and then immediately had merchants buy them back, thereby disrupting the market.
    When Elles was in Beijing, I also thought he was progressive, but when I came into contact with reality, it was not the case. He not only controlled the sovereignty of the materials, but even our things were controlled by him. US imperialism used "relief materials" to smuggle, transporting "relief materials" by air to Taiyuan, along with commercial goods. When the Executive Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) ended, they organized working teams to go to various places. Each team had to bring foreigners and a large number of merchants (and these foreigners brought a large number of merchants), and buy back the "relief materials" that had been distributed, thereby disrupting the market. This is their work.
    Liu Jiangwen:
    US imperialism used "relief" as an excuse to take photos everywhere and use them as propaganda materials.
    US imperialism's "relief materials" were useless. I remember that the people of Hankou refused "relief" and paraded in the streets in December, holding up the single clothes that had been distributed with bamboo poles. The "relief materials" included electric fans, pipes, and playing cards, which we did not need. US imperialism used "relief" as an excuse, such as holding one or two porridge distributions and distributing milk, and taking photos everywhere to use them as propaganda materials. There was also one thing: the Ji-Re-Ping-Jin Working Team went to Yongnian, which was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, to provide disaster relief. The working team had originally agreed with the Liberated Area authorities that they would not attack the city when distributing relief materials, but after the working team entered the city, it instigated the Kuomintang bandit army to fire cannons into the city from outside the city in order to undermine the Communist Party's credibility.
    Qu Yuan:
    Exposing US imperialism's "relief" conspiracy is an important task in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country.
    We must eliminate the pro-American and fear-American diseases. US imperialism's "relief" is related to it. Exposing US imperialism's "relief" conspiracy and letting the Chinese people understand the aggressive essence of US imperialism more clearly and thoroughly is one of the important tasks in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our homes and country.

    首都救济界及有关人士举行座谈会
    揭露美帝利用“救济”进行侵略阴谋
    【本报讯】十一月二十八日奥斯汀在安理会的荒谬演说，涉及美国的“救济物资”“救济”了中国人民，其目的完全是想给美帝利用“救济”进行侵略阴谋的事实作掩护，首都救济界及有关人士特就此项问题于十二月六日在中国人民救济总会举行了一次座谈会。到会者有彭泽民、谢觉哉、伍云甫、司徒美堂、赵朴初、舒舍予（老舍）、雷洁琼、吴景超、方与严、熊瑾玎、关瑞梧、刘清扬、顾锦心、刘绛文、胡兰生、廖梦醒、管大同、章元善、沈元晖、丑子冈、谢邦定（杜百受代）、陈舜裔、屈元、于汝麒、杜波等三十余人，发言极为热烈。
    熊瑾玎：
    中国人民一向是自力更生不依靠外援的，美帝以“剩余物资”假借“救济”美名，打入中国作破坏工作。
    中国人民一向是自力更生不依靠外援的。毛主席的“论人民民主专政”中，早就指出过我们需要英美政府的援助是幼稚的想法。董必武副总理在“新中国的救济福利事业”的报告中，也指出过美帝叫嚣“救济”，是另有企图的。帝国主义者就是要以“救济”的美名，打入中国做破坏工作。美帝的“救济物资”是他们的“剩余物资”，尤其是“军用剩余物资”。如美帝操纵的联合国儿童基金会运至解放区的八百二十四箱“救济物资”中，竟有三百零四箱手纸和几十箱ＤＤＴ喷雾器。美帝在中国进行“救济”的事实也说明真正得到美帝“救济”的不是人民，是蒋介石反动政府、宋子文之类的官僚资本家、匪徒特务等等。反动政府拿“救济物资”作打内战资本，京津各地现在还能看到罐头牛奶充斥市场，这就是国民党官僚资本家倾销到市场上的美国“救济物资”。
    彭泽民：
    美帝操纵联总垄断米价，使老百姓饿肚子，这比拿刀子屠杀人民更加厉害。
    我国南方各省原是产米区，反动统治造成农村生产不足，乃依靠越南、暹罗等国大米的输入。美帝便操纵联总垄断越南、暹罗等国米价，输入米价全由联总支配，借此剥削中国人民。当时香港米价比平时高出数倍，引起香港工人们因不能生活而罢工，南方各地也是如此。老百姓不买罢，就要饿肚子，这比拿刀子屠杀人民还要厉害。
    伍云甫：
    美帝违反不歧视原则，操纵联总，分配给占灾民人口五分之三的解放区以百分之二弱的物资。这就是所谓“救济中国人民”的实际情况。
    联总标榜不歧视原则，但执行原则时并不如此。抗战中遭敌人“三光政策”受灾最重的解放区灾民有二千六百万，占当时全国灾民四千二百万的五分之三，应得“救济物资”的五分之三，而美帝操纵联总仅分配给百分之二弱的物资。从这一点我们就可以知道奥斯汀所说的“救济了中国人民”的实际情况如何。美帝以所谓“救济”换得了蒋介石的无数特权，这种“救济”，是有用小虾钓鲤鱼的阴谋的。
    刘清扬：
    美帝除了援助蒋介石外，以少许渣滓分给人民，收买灵魂，使一部分人受了欺骗。
    美帝借“救济”作了不少麻痹和欺骗人民的宣传，他在援助蒋介石外，以少许渣滓分给人民，收买灵魂。那时的北京市长曾亲自到火车站背二百斤美国面粉运上汽车，然后大事宣传，美国如何援助，市长如何爱人民。然而是谁炸了我们人民，再来“救济”呢？这种欺骗，真是混账。在中国如北京各大学教授是有得过两袋面粉的，学生也有喝过牛奶的，但在沈崇事件发生后，曾有许多教授和同学愤怒的抛掉了这些侮辱中国人民的东西。可是目前的确有一部分落后分子还相信其欺骗，今天我们应当认清，只有中国人自己才能救自己，两年来的水灾，人民政府曾进行了源源不绝的救济，今年水灾，天津没有被淹，就是人民自己的功劳。
    沈元晖：
    美帝戴着和我们“合作”的假面具用派来的“专家”在中国作反动宣传。
    我和美帝合办过卫生人员训练班。首先，他提出很高的条件，要用美式房子和设备，大事铺张，使我们花了不少钱。而所谓美国“专家”则借此想自己搞一套卫生组织，不受人民政府领导，更以此计划宣扬中国解放区卫生人员全是美国训练出来的。同时，以小恩小惠拉拢学生，造成不团结，拿学校发的饼干散给居民，作美帝“慈善”的宣传；以不切实际的教材教学生，当我们学习“社会发展史”的时候，散给学生“上帝造人”的小册子。他们供给的“救济物资”也都是不适用的，一个接生包得两个人抬，里面装的却是盐水、肥皂水，和我们不敢用的过时药品。这证明全是“剩余物资”，他们就这样戴着假面具和我们“合作”，我们应当予以揭破。
    谢觉哉：
    美国那么多失业工人不加救济，而将麦子烧掉，牛奶倒入海里，为什么会忽然关心到万里以外的中国人民？
    帝国主义在自己的算盘上计算着两个侵略办法：一个办法就是奥斯汀所讲的“救济物资”、办学校、马歇尔计划、第四点计划等；另一办法就是用炸弹、超级空中堡垒、原子弹来“维持世界安全”“保护民主制度”。两个办法，一个目的：即如何统治人民，看那个赚钱又省事，然后才做。美帝拿“救济物资”“帮助人”，使别人生产垮台，使人认为美国货好，美国人好，可是美国国内那么多失业工人，而将麦子烧掉，牛奶倒到海里去，为什么会忽然关心到万里以外的中国人民呢？今天人民不受麻醉，不受欺骗，他就不干了，他就要使用原子弹了。这可算是“图穷匕首见”，剥削者压迫者到了这种地步，是谈不上什么“慈善”和“良心”的。美帝在朝鲜滥炸和平居民，有什么“慈善”？真正的“救济”只有在没有剥削没有压迫的社会才有。
    雷洁琼：
    美帝想以“救济”阻止我们革命成功，“挽回中国人心”，以救济机构笼络知识分子，使其丧失中国人民的民族自尊心。
    美帝的“救济”是想用以阻止我们革命的成功。美国“援华联合会”就曾以“多捐一元钱，即多阻止共产主义发展的一分力量”的口号作捐募“救济款”的标语，并且还想利用救济机构作情报工作。只因我办了点儿童福利事业，探听情报者即源源而来。美帝的“救济”对中国知识分子影响很大，很多知识分子不做为人民服务的事业，而被吸引到庞大的联总中去。有一些人办慈善事业，也是为争取上美国去，拉拢美国人。美国式的“救济”就这样使中国人民丧失了民族自尊心。美帝更想以“救济”获得中国的人心，美国人周以德到燕京大学，我很“荣幸”地陪他吃过饭，他问到美国应如何“帮助”中国，他承认蒋介石没办法了，他问“是否可以拿救济来挽回中国人心”，从这一点，我已认识美帝的“救济”是什么东西了。
    吴景超：
    美帝在中国造成大灾后，再施以小“救济”，不是美帝的“救济”，中国不会饿死那么些人。
    一九四六年我在湖北看到美国将面粉运到汉口，再运到老河口，很不经济。如在汉口卖出一吨面粉的价钱，能在老河口买到二吨半，可以多救济一些人，可是联总不肯这么办，一定要将美国面直接运老河口，使老百姓知道这是美国“救济物资”，好作收买人心的宣传。有些所谓联总的专家在发放面粉时，手续繁多，发放之先，甚至连灾民每家藏有多少粮食、牛肉、猪肉、鸡蛋都要调查登记，这不是笑话！结果“救济粮”未发下，而饿死的人已不知多少。美帝就这样在中国造成大灾后再施以小“救济”，不是美帝的“救济”，中国不会饿死那么些人。
    赵朴初：
    美帝的“救济”政策是为了实现他血腥的侵略，我们更唤起人民，认清美帝、肃清糊涂思想。
    去年春天我在上海接收一批美帝经合总署的物资，该署上海办事处主任圣·路易表示物资可以交出，但必须通过由三个外国教会救济团体组成的托管委员会，遵守他们的规则，受其控制，要求我们最高当局与上海军管会予以书面保证，对这批物资不加干涉。我们拒绝了，并报告军管会把它下令接收了。这证明美帝决没有真正的“救济”，真正的“慈善”。美帝的“救济”政策是为了在中国窃取主权，实现他血腥的侵略，百年来帝国主义的毒在中国一般人头脑里中得很深；我们要揭露其阴谋，唤起人民认清美帝，肃清糊涂思想。
    章元善：
    美帝过去给我们的“救济物资”，等于原子弹和大炮。
    奥斯汀到今天还认为中国人民是可欺骗的，以前有人认为他们的“救济”是基督教精神，现在知道连宗教都被他利用为侵略工具了。美帝过去给我们的“救济物资”就等于原子弹和大炮，奥斯汀的演说就是不打自招的口供。
    舒舍予：
    中国人民从来不向美帝“求怜”。
    奥斯汀以为他的演说虽不被中国人民接受，他相信会被美国人以及联合国中被美帝控制着的国家接受，使他们认为中国人民是“忘恩负义”的。美帝要造成美国人骄傲，卑视中国人的心理，经常地说中国只有贫穷破烂，要“求怜”于美国，其实，美帝的“帮助”，只帮助了蒋介石，获得了蒋介石的“服从”和特别“友爱”。现在中国政府是人民的革命的政府，中国人民从来不向美帝国主义“求怜”，现在更不向美帝“求怜”了。奥斯汀整个演说，只说明美国政府与蒋介石的关系，而不是美国人民与中国人民的关系。
    关瑞梧：
    我曾经以为美国的某“救济”官员，是中国的朋友，现在我已认识清楚了。
    我曾有机会在联合国机构里作儿童福利工作，当时我认为联总儿童基金会华北代表艾乐思好像是很忠实于中国的朋友。后来我看到不少顾问写信回美国去，只说享受如何好，如何享受双份薪水的待遇，谈话的结果如何好，其实这些人都在中国作些无用的工作，但联合国受着美帝的控制，现在揭穿了，我认识清楚了，我们不应让联合国变成美帝控制的工具。
    于汝麒：
    美帝发放了“救济物资”，随手又使商人收买回去，借此扰乱市场。
    艾乐思在北京时，我也认为他是进步的，但接触到实际就不然了，他不但控制了物资的主权，连我们的东西也被他控制。美帝将“救济物资”拿来走私，把“救济物资”空运太原，附带装运商货。行总结束时，他们组织工作队到各地去，每队都要带外国人和大批商人（而这些外国人又带着大批商人），将发出去的“救济物资”，随手收买回来，借此扰乱市场，这就是他们的工作。
    刘绛文：
    美帝假借“救济”到处拍照，拿出去作宣传材料。
    美帝的“救济物资”都没用处，我记得汉口人民曾拒绝“救济”，于十二月以竹杆举着发下的单衣服在街上游行。“救济物资”中有电扇、烟斗、扑克牌，都是我们不需要的，而美帝假借“救济”，如搞一两次施粥，发牛奶，到处拍照，拿出去作宣传材料。还有一件事，冀热平津工作队曾到被解放军包围的永年放赈，工作队原与解放区当局商妥发放救济物资时不攻城，但当工作队入城后，即怂恿国民党匪军出城向城内放炮，以此破坏共产党信用。
    屈元：
    揭露美帝“救济”阴谋，是抗美援朝保家卫国运动中的重要工作。
    我们要肃清崇美与恐美病，美帝的“救济”是与它有关的。将美帝“救济”阴谋揭露，让中国人民更清楚地彻底了解美帝的侵略实质，是抗美援朝保家卫国运动中重要的工作之一。
