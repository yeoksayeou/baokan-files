Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: According to TASS, New York: At the United Nations General Assembly plenary meeting on the morning of December 14th, the US-UK majority, disregarding the opposition of the delegations from the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, decided to urgently review the proposal that the Political Committee had forcibly passed the day before. This proposal requested the establishment of a three-person group, including the President of the General Assembly, to seek a ceasefire in Korea. It was also decided that the proposal would not be subject to general debate, but would be put to a vote immediately.

This proposal was put forward by thirteen countries, including India, Pakistan, and Egypt, during the Political Committee's discussion of the slanderous case accusing the "Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China of interfering in Korea." Under the illegal control of the US-UK bloc, the Political Committee interrupted the consideration of the "Soviet accusation against the United States for aggression against China" and accepted the aforementioned slanderous case. Subsequently, the Political Committee interrupted the consideration of the slanderous case and accepted the thirteen-nation proposal, thereby shelving the discussion of the Soviet proposal on the slanderous case. The Soviet proposal advocated the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, allowing the Korean people to resolve the Korean issue themselves.

Before the vote on the thirteen-nation proposal, Soviet representative Malik spoke first to state the reasons for voting, denouncing the illegal behavior of the US-UK bloc in violating procedures, and exposing the essence of the thirteen-nation proposal as an attempt to cover up US aggression. Malik reviewed the handling of the US slander case against the People's Republic of China in the Political Committee and the passage of the thirteen-nation proposal by the Political Committee, and pointed out that the review and vote on this proposal was a blatant violation of procedure. He declared that the Soviet delegation considered such a discussion of the issue to be incorrect and firmly opposed this strange and illegal procedure in the United Nations' consideration of issues.

Malik said that the Soviet Union opposed the General Assembly plenary meeting's review of the thirteen-nation proposal before the Political Committee discussed and passed a resolution on the Soviet delegation's proposal to demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and other proposals that the Political Committee should consider.

In stating the Soviet delegation's attitude towards the thirteen-nation proposal, Malik pointed out that the measures recommended in this proposal were merely to conceal an intention, which was to ensure that the US armed forces in Korea could continue to carry out armed intervention in the future. Malik urged the Assembly to pay attention to the speeches of the US and British representatives in the Political Committee, which fully exposed the intentions of the ruling groups of these countries. They opposed the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and tried to continue the armed intervention in Korea and US aggression in the Far East.

Malik emphasized that the only way to correctly resolve the Korean issue was for foreign troops to withdraw from Korea and for the Korean issue to be handed over to the Korean people to solve themselves. These suggestions are precisely included in the proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation, which is now being considered by the Political Committee.

Malik finally declared that the Soviet delegation, while insisting that the Political Committee should accept the proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation, would also vote against the draft resolution that had been submitted to the General Assembly.

Representatives from Ukraine and Byelorussia declared their opposition to the thirteen-nation proposal.

The head of the Polish delegation, Wierblowski, declared that the Polish delegation would vote against the thirteen-nation proposal because this proposal could not promote a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, but could only help the aggressors and encourage them to carry out new acts of aggression. Wierblowski pointed out that when the US troops were advancing in Korea, the United States ignored the suggestions for a ceasefire in Korea. It was only when the Korean People's Army reorganized its forces and received the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, launched an offensive, inflicted successive defeats on the enemy, and forced the enemy to retreat, that the United States began to talk about a ceasefire. He emphasized that only when foreign troops withdrew from Korea could peace be restored to this country, and the Korean people could freely decide their own destiny. The Polish delegation fully supported the Soviet proposal.

Czechoslovak representative Hajdu also spoke out strongly against the thirteen-nation proposal. He declared that the purpose of this proposal was only to save the US interventionist forces in Korea from complete defeat and to give these troops a breathing space so that they could continue their intervention in the future.

After the representative from Egypt spoke, the thirteen-nation proposal was passed with fifty-two votes for, five votes against (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia), and one abstention (Kuomintang elements).

At the afternoon meeting on the 14th, the President of the General Assembly, Entezam, announced that Indian representative Rau and Canadian representative Pearson had accepted appointments to work in the three-person group.

    马立克在联大全体会议上发言            
    揭露十三国提案掩护侵略本质            
    美英集团竟操纵多数悍然通过该项提案
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：在十二月十四日上午联合国大会全体会议上，美英多数不顾苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克五国代表团的反对，决定紧急审议政治委员会先一日所强行通过的要求成立包括大会主席在内的三人小组寻求在朝鲜停战的基础的提案，并且决定对该案不再举行一般辩论，而迳行表决通过。
    这个提案是印度、巴基斯坦、埃及等十三国在政治委员会讨论诬告“中华人民共和国中央人民政府干涉朝鲜”的诽谤案时提出的。在美英集团非法把持之下，政委会曾中断审议“苏联控诉美国侵略中国案”，而受理上述诽谤案。接着，政委会又中断对上述诽谤案的审议，而受理十三国提案，并从而搁置了对苏联就上述诽谤案提出的提案的讨论。苏联提案主张一切外国军队立即撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题。
    在表决十三国提案以前，苏联代表马立克首先发言申述投票理由，痛斥美英集团这种破坏程序的非法行为，并揭露十三国提案企图掩护美国侵略的本质。马立克回顾了美国对中华人民共和国的诽谤案在政治委员会中处理的经过以及政委会通过十三国提案的经过，并指出：审议与表决这项提案，乃是对程序的蛮横破坏。他宣称：苏联代表团认为对这个问题作如此的讨论是不正确的，并坚决反对在联合国内审议问题时的这种奇怪与非法的程序。
    马立克说：在政治委员会就苏联代表团要求一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的提案以及政治委员会应加审议的其他提案进行讨论和通过决议之前，苏联反对大会全体会议审议十三国提案。
    马立克在申明苏联代表团对十三国提案的态度时指出：这个提案建议采取的措施，仅仅是为了掩饰一种意图，这就是要保证在朝鲜的美国武装部队有可能在将来继续进行武装干涉。马立克促请大会注意美国和英国代表在政治委员会上的发言，那些发言充分暴露了这些国家统治集团的意图，他们反对外国军队立即从朝鲜撤退，而力图使在朝鲜的武装干涉和美国在远东的侵略得以继续进行。
    马立克强调指出：要想正确解决朝鲜问题，只有外国军队撤出朝鲜，并把朝鲜问题交给朝鲜人民自己解决。而这些建议就正包括在苏联代表团所提出的、现在正由政治委员会加以考虑的提案中。
    马立克最后宣称：苏联代表团一面坚持政治委员会应接受苏联代表团所提出的提案，同时并将投票反对已经提交大会全体会议的该决议草案。
    乌克兰、白俄罗斯代表声明反对十三国提案。
    波兰代表团团长威尔勃洛夫斯基宣称：波兰代表团将投票反对十三国提案，因为这一提案不能促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，只能帮助侵略者并鼓励他们进行新的侵略行为。威尔勃洛夫斯基指出：当美国军队在朝鲜前进的时候，美国对于在朝鲜停战的建议是置之不理的。只是当朝鲜人民军将队伍加以整顿并且得到中国人民志愿军的援助，发动攻势，使敌军迭遭失败并迫使敌军退却的时候，美国才开始谈论什么停战。他强调指出：只有外国军队撤出朝鲜，这个国家的和平才能恢复，朝鲜人民才能自由地决定他们自己的命运。波兰代表团充分支持苏联的提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表哈奇杜也发言强烈反对十三国提案。他宣称：这一提案的目的只是要拯救在朝鲜的美国干涉军使之免于完全失败，并给这些军队以喘息的时间，使他们将来可以继续进行干涉。
    在埃及代表发言后，十三国提案即以五十二票对五票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克）获得通过。一票（国民党分子）弃权。
    在十四日下午会议上，大会主席安迪让宣布：印度代表劳氏与加拿大代表皮尔逊已接受在三人小组中工作的任命。
