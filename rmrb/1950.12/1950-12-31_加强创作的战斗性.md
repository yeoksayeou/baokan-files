Strengthen the Combat Effectiveness of Creative Work
Ren Zhi

Editor's Note: The enthusiastic literary work unfolded in the great movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country has greatly strengthened and advanced the patriotic literary front of the people. This is primarily reflected in the clearer and deeper understanding of the literary thought of loving the motherland and loving the people. At the same time, it should also be admitted that some remaining paralysis on the literary front has not yet been eradicated. But in general, the literary army, inheriting the excellent traditions of the past, has not only enthusiastically demonstrated a valuable political sensitivity, but has also gradually gathered under a clearer and more specific battle call. Secondly, it is reflected in the fact that although the literary mobilization for combat has not been sufficient so far, the breadth of authors and the diversity of works have shown the strength of the forces. It is particularly noteworthy that this movement has awakened countless workers and students who love literature or are beginners in writing; they are the reserve and new forces of the literary troops. This increasing development of mass literature is an important sign of the expansion and strengthening of the people's patriotic literary front.

Regarding the many works produced in this great movement, we published an article entitled "Under the Great Theme" some time ago, and now we are publishing this article for readers' reference. However, we feel it is necessary to point out an important issue that has not been addressed by these two articles or some other commentaries, namely: In order to promote the patriotic, anti-U.S. aggression and aid-Korea creative work of the people, we must adhere to the correct struggle on two fronts. On the one hand, we must oppose those who evade frontal struggle under the pretext of the broad scope of creative activities, refuse to deeply study current events and complete political tasks in a timely manner; on the other hand, we must also oppose the vanguard tendency of being too far removed from the general level of awareness of the masses, such as thinking that those who do not volunteer to join the army are not patriotic, and that only themes of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea are acceptable. Undoubtedly, both of these deviations will only weaken the combat power of literature and art. It must be recognized that the anti-U.S. aggression and aid-Korea literary movement is none other than the people's patriotic literary movement. It has a long historical tradition, a broad front, and a bright future.

The great patriotic movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea has set off a vigorous wave of creative enthusiasm. Under the call of the joint declaration of various democratic parties, the literary and art troops have been rapidly and widely mobilized. In a very short period of time, various forms of literary and artistic works have emerged, especially short and popular ones, and authors of various identities have been involved in the movement, including veteran writers who have picked up their pens again, and workers and students who are beginners in writing. We see that the literary and artistic ranks are participating in the solemn and sacred struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country with such vitality.

In the blooming of various creative works, excellent works continue to emerge. However, since the central purpose of literary and artistic creation is to fight against the enemy and educate the people, we very much need to constantly examine the achievements we have made, gain experience, and overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes. Do not forget to use our winning products, and do not take the wrong damp grenades, or mortars filled with sand; nor should we let tanks lack a part or load bullets that have misfired into the gun barrel.

It is particularly noteworthy that small forms created by many workers or students themselves often receive great results in performances. This is partly because the theme of resisting U.S. aggression is clear and meets the requirements of the broad masses, and partly because the form is popular. However, such works have rarely been compiled and published to this day, which is a defect.

Among the various types of works published, poetry is the most numerous. This is by no means something to be criticized; on the contrary, we should say to all people who are willing to serve the people in the form of poetry in this great era: Write! Write more! But in order to carry out effective struggle, they should also be required to write poetry better. Many poems (the poems mentioned here include clapper talk, drum lyrics, ditties, Suzhou ballads, Yue opera introductions, etc.) are merely simple revisions of political slogans and thesis points, rhyming and dividing them into lines. Empty, dry, and abstract words replace fresh, lively, and vivid descriptions. Some poems are really not as clean and neat as slogans, and not as appealing; and they are often stuttering, vague in meaning, and even incomprehensible without notes. (If it is a libretto, can you sing a "note" after the main text is finished?) For example:

What is "guaranteeing the stability of the Korean situation"?
This is guaranteeing the rape and plunder of the U.S. military!
What is "holding elections under the supervision of the United Nations"?
This is forging public opinion under the guns of the United States!

Although the author's exposure is completely correct, it lacks the heart-stirring appeal that poetry should have. With less effort spent on creation, the weapons produced are inevitably somewhat blunt. There are even cases where the author does not think deeply when writing, which may cause readers to misunderstand. For example, a Yue opera introduction "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Protecting the Home and Defending the Country" describes the enemy saying: "(Increased) a large number of cannon fodder to the front line; (can't help but) parting from life and death, tears streaming down; the flames of war burn to the Sino-Korean border, not allowing the people to use water and electricity..." It is, of course, premature to think that the U.S. imperialist aggressors are "tears streaming down" leaving the United States, and "not allowing the people to use water and electricity" makes the crimes of U.S. imperialist aggression too light.

The "Fisherman's Hate" drum lyrics are loved by the masses because of its vivid description and rich emotions, so it is performed everywhere, and there are also adaptations into operettas. Audiences are often moved to tears. But many imitations are inferior in comparison. The problem here is that many authors are not good at writing about actual life experiences, not good at reflecting the great events of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea from the specific details of life, not good at observing the new people and new things that have emerged in this great movement, but simply go to fantasize about scenes on the Korean battlefield. On the contrary, many who write about their own work posts or actual life experiences often succeed. For example, a poem written by a worker is simple and moving: "Heavy hammer in hand, hitting twenty-eight more splints, production is like going to the front line, forging is like hitting the U.S. empire." ("We are not afraid of anything")

So first, do not immediately start writing emptyly grasping some concepts or some fragments of facts, you must express those correct concepts and effectively use those realistic materials through your own inner feelings and then through concrete images. For example, to explain to the audience or readers that the American paper tiger is not terrible, it is useless to say this sentence back and forth, even if it is repeated a thousand times. But a novel like "Despise It" is much more effective. The story is: A liberation fighter admired American equipment, American training, and even missed American military regulations; he looked down on the People's Liberation Army. But when he participated in the People's Liberation Army's operations and saw how the enemy was defeated miserably, he realized: "No matter how good the weapons are, they are useless without brave people to master them."

It is extremely important to grasp the existing problems and solve them. For example, the worker-created novel "The Murderous Knife with the American Brand" is indeed crude, but it is very valuable. It writes about a worker who only wants to use American-made pliers. When he discovers that a pair of pliers that he has been using smoothly and always thought was American-made is actually Chinese-made, his psychology of worshiping the American brand changes. Then, when he discovers that the bomb that killed his relatives and friends is engraved with the American brand, he develops hatred for "U.S.A." This is exposing a social psychology of losing national self-confidence, which has been formed under the long-term U.S. imperialist aggression, from a pair of pliers. Today's China is no longer the colonial China ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Many people often cannot fully recognize this point in specific matters. Therefore, it is very necessary to expose the pro-American psychology of "the American moon is also good" and the slavish thinking of lacking national self-confidence. This way of writing that raises problems and solves problems from the subtle observations of life is much more eloquent than abstract and empty words.

Some authors also try to solve many problems in one work, and therefore lose themselves in being all-encompassing, chaotic and disorganized; or they put out the problems without solving them; or they try to solve the problems in a very simple and crude way, but in reality they cannot solve them; even worse, they make the readers and listeners take an attitude of distrust, saying that you are bragging. "The power of the atomic bomb is not terrible, tell you, victory must have confidence!" ("Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid-Korea Ditty") This kind of lyrics is extremely unpersuasive. If the reader goes to read Joliot-Curie's scientific explanation of why the atomic bomb is not terrible or other well-reasoned comments, it is much easier to understand. It is true that some people can only listen and cannot read, then the author has a greater need to consider the possible impact of his work on the audience. This anemia of the work, on the one hand, is still lost in emptiness, and being all-encompassing in one work, wanting to be comprehensive in everything, the result is nothing is accomplished. Many crosstalks have obviously committed this problem. However, an article like "So American" not only provides sufficient reasons for exposing the atomic bomb bluff, but also does it thoroughly, allowing the audience to easily understand the baseness of U.S. imperialism.

The most important thing is still the ideological content of the work. And the efforts of the current creative circle to explore this core issue are still insufficient.

For example, in the novel "Innocent Child," the author's motive is of course to expose the crimes of the U.S. military—raping a Chinese girl, Shuzhen, and leaving after she became pregnant, returning to the United States. However, the author focuses on describing how Shuzhen's child is ridiculed by the neighborhood children as a "hybrid" at any time and place, and how Shuzhen is helpless and lonely after her robber husband leaves and never returns. This is absolutely wrong description. The Chinese people can't wait to push the American robbers into the sea, and even Shuzhen should not hope that her robber husband will come back. But in the author's pen, the American robber seems to be just a prodigal son who does not return. This is not only not educational for the reader, but also has very bad side effects.

There is also a phenomenon that weakens the combat effectiveness of works due to the lack of ideological content, and that is to vulgarize the just struggle. The article "Fighting with the Nose" mocks the U.S. empire from the "high nose," which cannot harm the enemy in any way, but will breed narrow racial concepts. Also, such lines as, "Do you know what 'American civilization' is? It's your wife's menstrual cloth!" What can this kind of poetry educate people? To describe our just and solemn struggle with this kind of expression that can only give people the impression of "making trouble without reason" is a blasphemy! Curses can never solve any problems. No, curses will only increase the difficulty of solving problems.

Literary and artistic works, in order to become weapons for solving ideological problems and educating the people in any movement, should always be vigilant against this tendency of vulgarization. And it should be recognized that the emergence of this tendency is a principled ideological problem - not treating the sacred and solemn tasks before us with sufficient seriousness.

    加强创作的战斗性
    任之
    编者按：在抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动中展开的热烈的文艺工作，已经使人民爱国主义的文艺战线大大地加强与推进了一步。这首先表现在爱祖国爱人民的文艺思想更加明确和深入了。同时也应该承认，文艺战线上的某些残存的麻痹现象还没有肃清。但就总的方面说，继承了历来优良传统的文艺大军，不仅热烈地表现了可贵的政治敏感性，并且逐渐结集在一个更明确更具体的战斗号召之下了。其次，它表现在文艺的战斗动员到现在为止虽然还很不充分，但是作者的广泛和作品的多样，已经显示出实力的雄厚。尤其值得注意的是这运动唤起了无数爱好文艺或初学写作的工人和学生，他们是文艺部队的后备的新生的力量。这种群众性文艺的日益发展，正是人民爱国主义文艺战线扩大和加强的重要标志。
    关于这伟大运动中所产生的许多作品，我们前些时已经发表过“在伟大的主题下”一篇评论，现在再发表这篇文章供读者参考。但是我们觉得必需指出一个重要的但却不曾被这两篇以及其他一些评论所涉及的问题，这就是：为了推进人民爱国主义的抗美援朝创作，我们必需坚持正确的两条战线斗争，一方面反对借口创作活动范围太广而逃避正面斗争，拒绝深入研究时事和及时完成政治任务；另一方面，也要反对离开一般群众觉悟程度太远的先锋主义倾向，如认为非志愿参军不爱国，非抗美援朝的题材不取。无疑的，这两种偏向都只会削弱文艺的战斗力量。必须认清：抗美援朝文艺运动，这不是别的，这就是人民爱国主义的文艺运动。它具有悠长的历史传统，广阔的战线，和远大的前途。                                                          
    伟大的抗美援朝的爱国主义运动，掀起了目前蓬蓬勃勃的创作热潮。在各民主党派联合宣言的号召下，文艺部队迅速地、广泛地动员起来了。很短的时间内，出现了各种形式的文艺作品；尤以短小通俗者为多，各种身份的作者都卷到运动中来，包括重新提起笔来的老作家，和初学写作的工人和学生。我们看见，文艺队伍是如此生龙活虎地参加了抗美援朝保家卫国的庄严的神圣斗争。
    在百花齐放的创作中，优秀作品不断涌现出来。但是，文艺创作的中心目的既然是对敌人作战和教育人民，我们就非常需要随时检查我们所达到的成绩，取得经验；并且克服缺点，改正错误。不要遗忘了我们的胜利品不用，也不要拿错了受潮的手榴弹，灌过沙子的迫击炮；也不要让坦克缺少一个零件或者把塌了火的子弹装在枪筒里。
    特别值得注意的是许多工人或学生自己创作的小形式，往往在演出中收到很大的效果，这一方面是因为抗美的主题鲜明，适合广大群众的要求，一方面也因为形式通俗。但是这类作品到现在还很少整理出加以发表的，这是一个缺陷。
    在发表的各类作品中，诗是最多的。这绝不是应该指责的事情；相反的，应该对在这大时代中愿意以诗的形式服务于人民的一切人们说：你们写吧！写得再多些！但是为了进行有效的斗争，还应该要求他们把诗写得更好。有不少的诗（这里所说的诗，包括快板、鼓词、小唱、弹词、越剧开篇，等等）仅仅是简单地把政治口号、论文要点，改头换面加以押韵和分行。空洞、枯燥的抽象词句，代替了新鲜活泼的生动描写。有的诗实在不如标语口号更干净俐落，更有号召力；而往往是结结巴巴，意思模糊，甚至没有注都不能懂。（如果是唱词，难道在正文唱完以后还可以唱上一条“注”吗？）例如：
    什么是“保证朝鲜情势稳定”？
    这就是保证美军奸淫掳掠！
    什么叫“在联合国监督下举行选举”？
    这就是在美国的枪炮下伪造民意！
    作者的揭发虽然完全是对的，但却没有诗所应有的打动人心坎的感染力。在创作上花费的劳力少，造出的武器就难免有些钝。甚至有因为写作的时候不深思，而可能引起读者误解的，象有一首越剧开篇“抗美援朝，保家卫国”描写敌人说：“（增加了）大批炮灰到前线；（忍不住）生离死别泪涟涟；战火烧到中朝边，不许人民用水电……”以为美帝侵略军是“泪涟涟”地离开美国，固然言之过早，“不许人民用水电”更是把美帝侵略的罪行说得太轻松了。
    “渔夫恨”鼓词由于描写生动，感情充沛，为群众所喜爱，所以到处上演，还有改编为小歌剧的。观众往往被感动得流泪。但是许多模仿的作品却相形逊色。这里的问题是：有很多作者，不善于写出实际的生活感受，不善于从生活的具体情节上反映抗美援朝的伟大事件，不善于观察周围在这伟大运动中涌现的新人新事，却一味去幻想朝鲜战场上的场面。反之，有许多把本身工作岗位上或实际生活上的体验写出来的，却往往能够成功。例如一首工人作的诗就单纯动人：“粗重铁锤拿在手，多打夹板二十八，生产好比上火线，打铁象把美帝打。”（“我们什么都不怕”）
    所以第一，不要空空洞洞地抓住一些概念或一些片断的事实就马上照写出来，必须通过自己的内心感受，然后再通过具体的形象来表现那些正确的概念，来有效地利用那些现实的材料。例如要向观众或读者说明美国纸老虎的不可怕，假如只是把这句话说来说去，那即使重复一千遍也没有用。但是象“蔑视它”那样一篇小说，就有效得多。故事是：一个解放战士，崇拜美式装备、美式训练，甚至留恋美式操典；他看不起人民解放军。但是当他参加了解放军的作战，看到怎样把敌人打得惨败的事实之后，他这才明白了：“再好的武器没有勇敢的人来掌握也是白搭。”
    抓住存在着的问题而给以解决，是极为紧要的。例如工人创作的小说“美国招牌的杀人刀”，写得确是粗糙的，然而很有价值。它写一个只愿意用美国造老虎钳的工人，当他发现他使得很顺手的一直以为是美国货的一把老虎钳原来是中国货时，崇拜美国招牌的心理就改变了。再等到他发现炸死他的亲友的炸弹上面刻着美国招牌的时候，他对于“Ｕ．Ｓ．Ａ”就发生仇恨了。这就是从一把老虎钳上揭发了长期在美帝侵略下形成的一种丧失民族自信心的社会心理。今天的中国已经不是蒋介石匪徒统治的殖民地中国了，这一点有很多人往往在具体事情上还不能充分认识。因此，揭发“美国的月亮也是好的”的崇美心理和缺乏民族自信心的奴才思想，十分必要。这种从生活的细微观察中提出问题、解决问题的写法，远比抽象空洞的词句更富于雄辩性。
    还有些作者企图在一篇作品中解决很多问题，因而失之于包罗万象，杂乱无章；或者是把问题摆出来而没有解决；或者是企图十分简单粗卤地解决问题，实际却不能解决；更坏的是使得读者听者采取不信任的态度，说你吹牛。“原子弹的威力不可怕，告诉你，胜利一定有信心！”（“抗美援朝小唱”）这种唱词是极少说服力的。如果读者去读约里奥·居里关于原子弹不可怕的科学说明或其他立论健全的评论，要容易明白得多。不错，有些人是只能听不能读的，那么作者就更有必要考虑一下自己的作品在听众中可能产生的影响了。这种作品的贫血症，一方面固然仍是失之空洞，而包罗万象在一篇作品中，一心想要面面俱到，结果就一事无成。有许多相声更显然地犯了这个毛病。但是，象“如此美国”一篇，对原子弹牛皮的揭露，不但理由充足，而且淋漓尽致，使听众轻松地了解了美帝的卑劣。
    最主要的还是作品的思想性。而目前创作界对这核心问题的探求的努力，仍然是不够的。
    例如小说“无辜的孩子”，作者的动机当然是暴露美军的罪行——奸占了一个中国少女淑贞，在她怀孕之后扬长而去，回了美国。但是作者却着力描写淑贞所生的孩子如何随时随地被街坊的小孩们嘲笑为“杂夹种”，淑贞在强盗丈夫一去不复返以后如何无依无靠，孤苦伶仃。这是绝对错误的描写。中国人民恨不得把美国强盗推到海里去，连淑贞也不应希望她的强盗丈夫再来。可是在作者笔下美国强盗却好象不过是一个不回头的浪子。这就不仅对于读者没有教育意义，而且是有很坏的副作用的。
    还有一种现象也是由于思想性的贫乏，而削弱了作品的战斗性，这就是把正义的斗争庸俗化。“用鼻子作战”一文从“高鼻子”上嘲笑美帝，这并不能伤害敌人的什么，而会滋生狭隘的种族观念。又如，“你知道‘美国文明’是什么东西？是你老婆的月经布！”这样的诗句，能够教育人们什么呢？用这一类只能给人以“无理取闹”的印象的表现手法来描写我们的正义的庄严斗争，这是一种亵渎！漫骂是永远不能解决任何问题的。——不，漫骂只会增加解决问题的困难。
    文艺作品要在任何一个运动中成为解决思想问题教育人民的武器，就应该随时警惕这种庸俗化的偏向。并且应该认识这种偏向的产生是一个原则性的思想问题——没有用足够的严肃性来对待摆在我们面前的神圣庄严的任务。
