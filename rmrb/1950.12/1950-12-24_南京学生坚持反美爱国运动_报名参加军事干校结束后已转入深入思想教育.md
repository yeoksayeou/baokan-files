(From our newspaper in Nanjing) Xinhua Daily News: The anti-American patriotic movement of students in Nanjing, after one-third of the city's university and middle school students signed up to take the military cadre school entrance exams, has now moved into a stage of in-depth patriotic ideological study.

This anti-American patriotic movement of students in Nanjing can be roughly divided into three stages.

At the beginning of this month, students of Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, during their current affairs studies, first exposed the reactionary words and deeds of American professor Ferris, who insulted the Chinese people and promoted war. This immediately received enthusiastic support from more than sixty schools in the city. Especially in church schools, students successively exposed hidden imperialist elements disguised as teachers in various schools. At the same time, a widespread movement to accuse the US imperialists of their crimes of aggression against China was launched. Students began to seriously and deeply connect with themselves, criticizing pro-American and worship-American ideas that arose from the deception of US imperialist cultural aggression. On December 8, student representatives from more than sixty universities and middle schools held an accusation meeting. Many students, from their own painful accusations of being persecuted by US imperialism, began to awaken to patriotism and established ideas of hating and despising the United States. The week-long accusation movement deepened the patriotic thought of general students, and made a portion of students with worship-American and pro-American ideas begin to unreservedly love the motherland and hate the US imperialism, just as they said after awakening: "The deeper the love for the country, the more intense the hatred for the US."

During the "December 9th" demonstration parade of 30,000 university and middle school students in the city, students shouted the slogan: "Turn hatred into action!" Then, based on the ideological foundation of hating the US and making accusations, the movement was pushed to a new stage. The students wiped away their tears and set off an patriotic torrent of enrollment in military cadre schools. Students competed with each other and encouraged each other. Hao Zhenyi said: "In the past, my ideal was to be a prospector, mining mineral resources for the motherland, but when the US imperialists continue to invade us, I have a new ideal: to drive a sixty-ton tank and guard the border of the motherland, protecting more students to mine with peace of mind." Zhao Jiabi said at the enrollment meeting: "Without today's national defense construction, there will be no high tide of tomorrow's economic construction." When considering their future, the students linked their personal happiness with the fate of the country, fully demonstrating the noble qualities of new patriotism.

Similarly, teachers and mothers also stood side by side with students in the ranks of patriotism. Professors Fang Guangtao, Lei Zhenqing, and Wang Dechong of Nanjing University and Jinling University all personally sent their children to enroll. Professors Gao Juefu, Chen Naxun, and Zheng Wanjun even encouraged their two children to take the exams together. These patriotic teachers usually educated their students with the moral values of new patriotism. Today, seeing their children step onto the glorious post of the motherland, they all regard it as the greatest glory and joy in their lives. There are many touching stories of mothers encouraging their children to enroll. Ge Konggang's mother from Nanjing University Affiliated High School wrote a letter encouraging him, saying: "Which mother doesn't love her son? Who wants war to take away their children? But how can we, as mothers, let other people's sons protect our own sons? Do a good job! I hope you will give me greater happiness and comfort in the position of national defense construction!" Many mothers said: "Chairman Mao loves young people more than we do, he is a good mother to all the children of the nation." Therefore, they can confidently encourage their children to embark on the glorious post of the motherland.

Based on the unanimous patriotic ideology of students, teachers, and parents, the patriotic action of enrolling in military cadre schools has achieved significant results in Nanjing. In the past week, a total of 7,463 students have enrolled, accounting for 30% of the total number of university and middle school students in the city. Among them, 1,196 students enrolled at Nanjing University, accounting for 51% of the total number of students in the school.

    南京学生坚持反美爱国运动
    报名参加军事干校结束后已转入深入思想教育
    【本报南京电】新华日报消息：南京学生反对美国侵略的爱国运动，在全市三分之一的大、中学生报名投考军事干部学校之后，现已转入深入的新爱国主义的思想学习阶段。
    此次南京学生反对美国侵略的爱国运动，大致可分为三个阶段。
    本月初，金陵女子文理学院学生，在时事学习中，首先揭露了该校美籍教授费睿思侮辱中国人民，宣传战争的反动言行之后，立即获得全市六十余校热烈的声援。特别是教会学校，纷纷继起揭露各校穿着教师外衣的暗藏的帝国主义分子；同时展开了广泛的控诉美帝侵略中国罪行的运动。学生们开始认真、深入地联系自己，批判由于美帝文化侵略的蒙蔽而产生的亲美、崇美思想。十二月八日，六十余大、中学校学生代表举行了一个控诉大会。许多学生从亲身遭受美帝迫害的沉痛控诉中，开始了爱国主义的觉醒，并树立了仇美、鄙美的思想。一周来的控诉运动，加深了一般学生的爱国思想，使一部分有崇美、亲美思想的学生，开始无保留地热爱祖国，仇恨美帝，正如他们觉醒后所说的：“爱国愈深，仇美愈切”。
    “一二·九”全市三万大、中学生的示威游行中，学生们喊出了：“化仇恨为行动！”的口号。接着就在仇美控诉的思想基础上，运动推向了一个新的阶段。学生们擦干了眼泪，像波涛汹涌般地掀起了报名参加军事干部学校的爱国主义洪流。学生们彼此竞赛，互相鼓励。郝振益说：“过去我的理想是做一个探矿学家，为祖国开采矿藏，可是在美帝不断侵略我们的时候，我又有了新的理想：驾驶六十吨的坦克，守卫在祖国的边防。保护更多的同学安心采矿。”赵家壁在报名大会上说：“没有今天的国防建设，就没有明天的经济建设的高潮。”学生们在考虑前途的时候，都把个人幸福和国家命运联系在一起，充分显示了新爱国主义的崇高品质。
    同样的，教师和母亲们也和学生们并肩站在爱国的行列。南京大学、金陵大学的方光焘、雷振清、王德崇等教授，都亲送自己的子女前往报名。高觉敷、陈纳逊、郑万钧等教授，并且鼓励自己的两个孩子一起去投考。这些爱国的教师们，平素以新爱国主义的道德观教育学生，今天看到自己的子女走上祖国光荣的岗位，无不引为平生最大的光荣和欣喜。母亲们鼓励孩子报名的动人事迹非常多。南大附中葛孔钢的妈妈写信鼓励他说：“有那个母亲不爱儿子？谁愿意让战争夺去自己的孩子？可是，我们做母亲的，又怎能让别人的儿子来保护自己的儿子？好好干吧！希望你在国防建设的岗位上给我更大的快乐和安慰！”许多母亲都说：“毛主席比我们更爱青年，他是全民族孩子的好妈妈。”因此，她们放心地鼓舞儿女走上祖国光荣的岗位。
    在学生、教师、家长们一致的爱国主义的思想基础上所展开的报名参加军事干校的爱国行动，在南京已有了重大的成绩。一周来报名学生共计七千四百六十三人，占全市大中学生总数的百分之三十。其中南京大学报名的就有一千一百九十六人，占该校学生总数的百分之五十一。
