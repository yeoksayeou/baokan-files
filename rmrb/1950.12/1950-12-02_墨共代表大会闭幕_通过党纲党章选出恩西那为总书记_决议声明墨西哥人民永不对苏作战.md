Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, November 29th (via Telegraph) -- The 11th National Congress of the Mexican Communist Party victoriously concluded on the 25th. The congress unanimously adopted various resolutions, the Party Program, and the Party Constitution, and unanimously elected the new Central Committee. Encinas, who has led the Mexican Communist Party for over a decade, was re-elected as General Secretary amidst cheers. The congress, in thunderous applause, passed a resolution to pay tribute to Stalin, and to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of China, and the Korean Workers' Party.

The congress's resolutions mainly emphasized the struggle against the current war plans of American imperialism and denounced the Tito clique as agents of American imperialism.

The resolution declared that the Mexican people "will never fight against the Soviet Union, which has never threatened Mexico's sovereignty." On the other hand, the resolution pointed out: "American imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of Mexico's national independence and sovereign integrity." After exposing that American imperialism is attempting to place Mexico under their military and political domination, the resolution called on "all forces willing to fight for peace against imperialist oppression, for national liberation, and for the democratic development of Mexico" to establish a broad national democratic united front as soon as possible. The resolution vehemently criticized the Aleman government's reactionary foreign policy of following the United States' lead, and demanded the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries.

In addition, the resolution also called for defending the rights of workers and peasants, confiscating large estates, distributing land, nationalizing imperialist enterprises, nationalizing banks, assisting the indigenous people, regulating prices, freezing rents, increasing wages by 30 percent, equal pay for equal work, and equal voting rights for men and women. The resolution concluded by pointing out shortcomings in the Party's work and calling for consolidating the Party's foundation in factories to lead the people in struggle.
