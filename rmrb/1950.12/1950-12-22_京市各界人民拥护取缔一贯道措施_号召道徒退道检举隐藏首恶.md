    [This Newspaper’s Report] People from all circles in Beijing are voicing support for the wise measures taken by the People's Government to resolutely suppress the Yiguandao sect and are exposing the crimes of Yiguandao. Leading figures from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Farmers' Associations, and the industrial and commercial sectors have expressed their firm support and called on Yiguandao followers to consciously renounce the sect and report any hidden ringleaders.
    Following the Beijing Municipal People's Government's proclamation to suppress Yiguandao, a leading figure from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions made a statement, saying: "The 400,000 workers of Beijing fully support this decision by the government. The workers of Beijing clearly recognize that Yiguandao is not only a feudal and superstitious organization but also a counter-revolutionary, anti-people secret agent organization. The reactionary heads of Yiguandao, after liberation, continued to act as agents for the American and Chiang Kai-shek cliques, spreading rumors and intimidating the masses everywhere, sabotaging production. For example, during the current movement to resist America and aid Korea, some Yiguandao leaders hidden in factories said, 'They are going to conscript soldiers!' affecting the morale of workers. After liberation, we, the working class, have become masters of our own destiny, and we are working hard for our future happy lives. Yet Yiguandao comes to sabotage production. We want to liberate Taiwan, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, and strive for peace. Yet Yiguandao acts as a running dog for Chiang Kai-shek, hoping for Chiang Kai-shek to return and for a third world war. Therefore, Yiguandao is entirely a counter-revolutionary, feudal, superstitious organization that poisons the people. We fully support the government's measures to strictly suppress the Yiguandao organization. Trade unions at all levels should effectively cooperate with the People's Government in carrying out the work of suppressing Yiguandao. Furthermore, in accordance with the spirit of the Beijing Municipal People's Government's proclamation, they should use various means to vigorously conduct political education work among the workers, so that the workers can further recognize the crimes of this reactionary organization. All workers in the city who have been deceived into joining Yiguandao should register or renounce the sect based on their status within the sect, break away from this organization that harms oneself and others, and accuse Yiguandao of its crimes to the people. At the same time, all workers in the city should report Yiguandao's activities to the People's Government and assist the People's Government in suppressing Yiguandao, so that our workers can produce well and build our happy lives."
    A leading figure from the Beijing Municipal Farmers' Association stated: "The Beijing Municipal People's Government's method of strictly suppressing Yiguandao and all secret societies is entirely in line with the demands of our 400,000 farmers in the suburbs, and we firmly support it. We understand very clearly that Yiguandao is a counter-revolutionary, anti-people, feudal, superstitious organization. Many of our farmers have suffered from its harms and deceptions, and many farm women have been insulted and raped. Yiguandao has colluded with the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to oppress us, causing many of our farmers to lose their land, become impoverished, and their families broken. After liberation, the Communist Party led us to turn over, and implemented land reform. This source of evil—Yiguandao, which was colluding with the landlord class—was resolutely obstructing and sabotaging our land reform, threatening farmers, saying: 'Whoever joins the Farmers' Association cannot be saved, and will surely lose their head when the doomsday comes.' It also secretly spread rumors of a change of regime to intimidate farmers, making them afraid to accept land. But in the end, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we shattered their conspiracy and victoriously completed land reform. We were given land, houses, farm tools, and livestock. Now that we are going to engage in production, Yiguandao is still not reconciled and is openly and secretly sabotaging production, creating rumors, and causing some of our farmers to be panicked and uneasy. The 'cutting of ovaries,' 'cutting of breasts,' 'white-haired ghosts,' and 'snatching children' rumors that were widely spread in the suburbs of Beijing were fabricated by Yiguandao. They vainly attempted to echo the conspiracies of the American and Chiang Kai-shek cliques, to take back our victorious fruits—land, houses, etc.—and make us return to the same lives as cattle and horses. These counter-revolutionary and anti-people actions and criminal facts are too numerous to recount.
    "In order to ensure that we can engage in production with peace of mind in the future, support our People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and support our volunteer army in resisting American imperialist aggression, in addition to supporting this measure by the government and actively assisting the government in completing this task, we also call on all farmers who have been deceived and coerced into joining Yiguandao to repent and renounce the sect immediately. At the same time, we demand that the government severely punish the ringleaders among them."
    The industrial and commercial sectors of Beijing support the Municipal People's Government's measures to strictly suppress Yiguandao and all secret societies. They have expressed their commitment to consolidating revolutionary order, practicing the principles of firm stance, recognizing enemies and friends, and preventing espionage as stipulated in the patriotic pact, assisting the government in reporting ringleaders of Yiguandao hidden in industry and commerce, helping coerced followers to register, and persuading deceived followers to renounce the sect.
    More than 200 leaders of various industry associations gathered on the 20th. Fu Huating, chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, spoke first, saying: "Yiguandao is not a religion at all, and its existence is detrimental to the development of industry and commerce." He called on the leaders of various industries to help their colleagues recognize that the government's measures to suppress Yiguandao are aimed at protecting the interests of the people and maintaining social order, and that they must assist the government in suppressing the ringleaders and saving the deceived followers. Subsequently, Sun Fuling, secretary-general of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, reported on the various crimes of Yiguandao since the period of Japanese imperialist rule, including deceiving backward masses, cheating, extorting, raping, sabotaging land reform, and disrupting revolutionary order. Shi Yaoxian, deputy secretary-general of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out: "In the past, imperialism weighed down on our national industrialists and merchants, and we were devastated and unable to develop. Now, imperialism has been driven away, but it is not reconciled and is expanding its war of aggression against Korea. At the same time, it is directing secret agents and bandits such as Yiguandao to spread rumors and sabotage production in our rear. We must not allow Yiguandao to continue to exist." Jiang Xiaoqiu, chairman of the soap-making industry association, accused Yiguandao agents of their crimes, saying: "Some time ago, our factory (Beijing Soap United Factory) sent salesmen to Pingdiquan to sell goods, and they heard a series of unfounded rumors there, scaring them so much that they returned with the goods." He angrily said, "When thousands upon thousands of our good Chinese sons and daughters are fighting resolutely and bravely against imperialism on the Korean front, how can we sit idly by and ignore the enemy's spies disrupting the order in our rear?" Jiang Xiaoqiu went on to analyze why some industrialists and merchants had also joined Yiguandao, saying: "The main reason is that in the old society, they could not see that the biggest enemy of national industry and commerce was imperialism and its running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries. Due to the dismal business operations, they felt distressed and were deceived into joining Yiguandao, hoping to use the 'protection' of the gods to improve their business, but the result was bankruptcy." Yao Wenhui and Wu Jincui, leaders of the grain industry and machinery industry associations, continued to speak, saying that they had personally seen many industrialists and merchants who joined Yiguandao eventually have all their property defrauded. They unanimously stated: "We must not underestimate this enemy that has penetrated the backward masses. We guarantee to convene industry conferences and group meetings to convey and explain the government's measures to suppress Yiguandao; we will also mobilize door-to-door to thoroughly eliminate hidden enemies, and at the same time persuade deceived followers to renounce the sect."

    京市各界人民拥护取缔一贯道措施
    号召道徒退道检举隐藏首恶
    【本报讯】京市各界人民纷纷拥护人民政府坚决取缔一贯道的贤明措施，揭发一贯道的罪恶。市总工会和农会负责人，以及工商界人士都表示坚决拥护，并号召一贯道徒自觉退道和检举隐藏的首恶。
    北京市人民政府发布取缔一贯道的布告后，本市总工会负责人发表谈话说：北京市的四十万工人完全拥护政府这一个决定。北京市的工友，清楚地认识了一贯道不但是一个封建迷信组织，而且是一个反革命反人民的特务组织。一贯道的反动头子，在解放后继续充当美蒋特务，到处散播谣言，恐吓群众，破坏生产。譬如在这次抗美援朝运动中，有的隐蔽在工厂的一贯道头子就说：“要抓兵了！”影响工人生产情绪。解放后，我们工人阶级当家作了主，正要为自己将来幸福的生活而努力生产，一贯道却来破坏生产，咱们要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石，争取和平，一贯道却给蒋介石当走狗，盼蒋介石回来，盼第三次世界大战。所以一贯道完全是毒害人民的反革命的封建迷信组织，我们完全拥护政府严厉取缔一贯道组织的措施。各级工会应切实配合人民政府，进行取缔一贯道的工作。并且要按照北京市人民政府布告的精神用多种多样的方式，大力向工友进行政治教育工作，使工友们进一步认识一贯道这个反动组织的罪行。全市曾被骗加入一贯道的工友，应依据自己在道内的身份进行登记或退道，脱离这个害人害己的组织，并向人民控诉一贯道的罪行。同时，全市工友们都应向人民政府检举一贯道的活动，协助人民政府取缔一贯道，咱们工人才能好好生产，建设咱们幸福的生活。
    京市农会负责人发表谈话称：北京市人民政府严厉取缔一贯道及所有会道门的办法，是完全符合我们郊区四十万农民的要求的，我们坚决拥护。我们了解得很清楚：一贯道是反革命反人民的封建迷信组织。我们不少农民曾身受它的危害与欺骗，不少农妇被侮辱与奸污。一贯道曾勾结了日寇和蒋介石匪帮来压榨我们，使我们不少农民失去了土地，倾家荡产，家破人亡。解放后，共产党领着我们翻身，实行土地改革，这一罪恶的渊薮——与地主阶级勾结在一起的一贯道，却在坚决地阻挠与破坏我们的土地改革，威胁农民说：“谁入农会谁不能得救，到劫数时非掉头不可”。并暗地散布变天谣言恐吓农民，使农民不敢要地，但最后我们还是在共产党领导下击破了他们的阴谋，胜利地完成了土地改革。我们分到了土地、房屋、农具、牲畜，我们要搞生产了，可是一贯道仍不死心，竟公开地和隐蔽地破坏生产，制造谣言，使我们部分农民恐慌不安。京郊“盛传”一时的“割卵子”“割乳房”“白毛鬼”“拍花”等谣言就是一贯道制造的。他们妄想呼应美蒋的阴谋，夺回我们胜利的果实——土地、房屋等，使我们仍回到那和牛马生活一样的日子里去；这些反革命、反人民的行动与罪恶事实是难以尽述的。
    我们为了今后可以安心地进行生产，支援我们的解放军解放台湾，支援我们的志愿军反抗美帝国主义的侵略，除拥护政府这一措施并积极协助政府完成这一工作外，并号召一切被欺骗诱迫加入一贯道的农民们应即悔悟退道，同时要求政府对其中之首恶分子给以严厉制裁。
    京市工商业界拥护市人民政府严厉取缔一贯道及所有会道门的措施。纷纷表示为巩固革命秩序，实践爱国公约中的坚定立场、认清敌友、防奸防谍的规定，协助政府检举一贯道隐蔽在工商业中的首恶分子，帮助胁从分子进行登记和说服被骗道徒退道。
    各行业公会负责人二百余人于二十日集会，工商联主席傅华亭首先讲话，他说：一贯道根本不是什么宗教，它的存在对发展工商业是不利的。他号召各行业负责人帮助同业认清政府取缔一贯道的措施，是为了保障人民利益、维护社会秩序，一定要很好地协助政府镇压首恶分子挽救受骗道徒。接着工商联秘书长孙孚凌报告了从日本帝国主义统治时期以来一贯道愚弄落后群众，欺骗、诈索、强奸、破坏土改和破坏革命秩序的种种罪恶。工商联副秘书长史耀先指出：过去帝国主义压在我们民族工商业者的头上，我们被摧残得不能发展，现在帝国主义被赶跑了但还不死心，在扩大侵朝战争的同时，指挥一贯道等特务匪徒在我们的后方造谣破坏生产，我们决不能允许一贯道继续存在。造胰业公会主委姜笑秋控诉一贯道特务的罪行，他说：我们工厂（北京肥皂联营工厂）前些日派推销员到平地泉销货，在当地听到一阵无稽的谣言，把他吓得带着货就回来了。他愤怒的说：“当我们成千上万中华好儿女在朝鲜前线和帝国主义坚决勇敢作战的时候，我们怎能还坐视敌人的奸细扰乱我们后方秩序而不管？”姜笑秋还进而分析一些工商业者为什么也曾经参加一贯道，他说：“那主要是在旧社会里看不透民族工商业的最大敌人是帝国主义和它的走狗国民党反动派，由于业务经营惨淡，感到苦闷，于是便被骗加入了一贯道，想借‘神’的保佑使营业好转，但结果是倾家败产。”粮食业、机器业公会负责人姚文辉和吴金萃接着讲话，他们说曾亲身看见许多参加一贯道的工商业者，最后全部财产被骗得一干二净，他们一致表示：我们不可轻视这个深入落后群众中的敌人，保证召开同业大会、小组会，传达、解释市政府取缔一贯道的措施；我们还要挨家动员，彻底肃清隐藏的敌人，同时说服受骗道徒退道。
