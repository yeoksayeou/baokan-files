    ACFTU Concludes Donations for Relief of Unemployed Workers
    Statement of Revenue and Expenditure Simultaneously Published, Surplus Funds Decided to be Transferred to International Workers' Mutual Aid Fund.
    [Our Dispatch] To conclude the donations for the relief of unemployed workers, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) hereby publishes a statement of revenue and expenditure and has decided to transfer the surplus of 2.2 billion yuan to the International Workers' Mutual Aid Fund. On April 20th, the ACFTU issued a letter to male and female workers and staff across the country, calling on all employed workers and staff to donate one day's wages to relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai and other parts of the country. Because the time for submitting donations varied from place to place, this work could not be announced in a timely manner. According to a report from the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, a total of 31,285,400,4320.97 yuan was received from donations nationwide (including 1,441,223,267.6 yuan retained and used locally by various local federations of trade unions). Before July 5th of this year, 28,792,233,617.1 yuan was allocated to the general trade unions (ACFTU offices) in major administrative regions. This was announced in the "People's Daily" and "Workers' Daily" on the 10th and 11th of the same month. After July 5th, according to reports from local federations of trade unions, an additional 201,542,046 yuan was retained and used locally without being submitted. Therefore, the total amount allocated to various regions was 28,993,775,663.1 yuan. With the above income and expenditure offset, there is a surplus of 2,291,628,657.87 yuan. The 59th meeting of the Standing Committee of the ACFTU resolved to transfer all the surplus of this donation for the relief of unemployed workers to the International Workers' Mutual Aid Fund. In order to ensure that workers and staff throughout the country understand the entire income and expenditure situation of the above-mentioned donation, the ACFTU is publishing a list in this newspaper (the table can be found on page 6 of today's newspaper).

    全总结束救济失业工人捐款
    收支概况同时列表公布，余款已决定移作国际工人互助基金。
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会为结束救济失业工人捐款，特将收支概况列表公布；并决定将余款二十二亿余元移作国际工人互助基金。该会于四月廿日发出告全国男女工人、职员书，号召全体在业工人和职员捐助一天工资，救济上海及全国各地失业工人。这一工作因各地捐款上缴时间不一，以致未能及时公布。现根据中国人民银行总行报告，前后收到全国各地捐款总共为三百一十二亿八千五百四十万零四千三百二十元九角七分（内各地总工会未上缴自行留用数计一十四亿四千一百二十二万三千二百六十七元六角）。除本年七月五日前分别拨交各大行政区总工会（全总办事处）二百八十七亿九千二百二十三万三千六百一十七元一角。并于同月十日、十一日在《人民日报》与《工人日报》公布外，七月五日以后又据各地总工会报告，未上缴自行留用数有二亿零一百五十四万二千零四十六元。因此，总共拨付各地数目为二百八十九亿九千三百七十七万五千六百六十三元一角。以上收支两抵，尚余二十二亿九千一百六十二万八千六百五十七元八角七分。经该会第五十九次常务委员会议议决将此项救济失业工人捐款余数全部移作国际工人互助基金之用。该会为使全国各地工人、职员明了上项捐款整个收支情况起见，特在本报列表公布（表见今日本报第六版）。
