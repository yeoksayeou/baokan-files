    Mayakovsky on America

    Mayakovsky left his homeland nine times to travel abroad. His longest and most extensive journey was in the summer of 1925, when he visited Spain, Mexico, and the United States. The result of this tour was a large number of poems and travelogues, which were later published under the titles "Spain," "Ocean," "Cuban Cigars," "Mexico," "America," and were included in the collection "I Discover America."

    While traveling abroad, Mayakovsky was always keenly aware of his responsibility as a poet of the world's first socialist country.

    "I am the ambassador of poetry," he wrote proudly.

    Love for the motherland permeates all of Mayakovsky's works. His most passionate and powerful verses are dedicated to this great emotion.

    The theme of love for the socialist country stands out even more clearly in his poems and essays about foreign countries. Outside the Soviet Union, he saw himself as an emissary of the new world, proud of his country's superiority, which had surpassed capitalist countries and realized the highest ideals of mankind.

    Mayakovsky's attitude towards bourgeois culture is an inheritance and development of the great Russian literary tradition.

    The outstanding Russian writer and revolutionary Radishchev, in his short poem "Freedom," hailed the American people's struggle for independence and denounced the tyranny and plunder of the rulers of the "New World." He saw poverty and enslavement coexisting with American bourgeois democracy. He sarcastically called America: "A happy place where a hundred arrogant people indulge in luxury, while millions of people lack the most basic means of survival and shelter from the cold and heat."

    Pushkin, with profound insight, saw that in the America of his time, mankind's noblest motives and aspirations were brutally suppressed. In his "John Tannor," written in 1826, he rebuked American democracy and culture for "intolerable despotism," "ruthless self-interest," and "odious cynicism."

    The best representatives of the revolutionary democrats of the 1840s to 1860s—Belinsky, Herzen, and Chernyshevsky—similarly exposed the hypocrisy and corrupt nature of American bourgeois "freedom." Chernyshevsky pointed out the slavery and hypocritical deception of American bourgeois democracy. He considered slavery to be the fundamental evil of the United States, and believed that the much-vaunted American democracy was limited and false, dependent on the money bag. He called the newspapers of bourgeois America "pure speculation based on stock trading calculations."

    The famous democratic writer Korolenko, in his novel "Without Language" (1865) and his collection of essays called "American Travel Notes," contrasted the flamboyant picture of the "New World" painted by American lying self-promoters with the actual situation in the country—the hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy, the corruption of courts and newspapers, the bestiality and rudeness, hypocrisy and cruelty of American colonists, and the police terror prevalent in the United States.

    Gorky, who visited the United States in 1906, called New York "the city of the yellow devil." Gorky mocked the hypocritical posture of those hired American writers who claimed to be "above politics" and "not subject to the control of money," precisely exposing the American newspapers' worship of money, the degradation of culture and art and the hypocrisy and vulgarity of American bourgeois society.

    Mayakovsky "discovered" the United States nineteen years after Gorky. Beneath the surface of the "prosperity era," he saw a country torn by sharp social contradictions, a poor and oppressed people ruled by stock exchange tycoons.

    Faced with the United States, with its skyscrapers and huge projects, watching New York's bridges, subways, and elevated railways, Mayakovsky never forgot that all of this was created by the "great army of labor," but was occupied by the bourgeoisie to serve their selfish purposes. Against this background, the image of the Soviet motherland, where "the abyss has been bridged by a bridge leading directly to communism," emerged even more solemnly in the poet's heart.

    Mayakovsky's keen observation, his passionate nature as a warrior and patriot combined with a fervent interest in things, produced poetic images of great ideological depth and infectiousness.

    The poet pointed out that in America, the parasitic minority carries out terrible exploitation of the toiling majority. The poet denounced Fordism as a sophisticated system of exploitation, and he revealed that the inhuman conditions of Ford's factories precisely show that American technology has not reduced human labor, but rather has exhausted their strength.

    The poet denounced national and racial discrimination in capitalist America. He angrily described those imperialist bigwigs who deprived oppressed people of their basic rights to survival:

    High above are the officials,
    Illuminated by the brilliance of diamonds.
    Below are the people.
    Bare-assed, without pants to cover themselves;
    Firstly they have none at all,
    Secondly—they are Indians:
    Forbidden to wear pants.

    Mayakovsky considered America to be the last bastion of imperialist reactionary forces. "It is possible," he wrote, "that America may become the last armed defender of the bourgeoisie's desperate cause—then history could write a tense little novel like Wells' 'The War of the Worlds.'"

    In exposing the anti-popular nature of bourgeois democracy, Mayakovsky pointed out the hypocrisy of "bourgeois freedom," the materialism and deception of bourgeois culture and morality. "Those newspapers," Mayakovsky said, "are founded by trusts, trusts, and the bosses of the trusts sell them to advertisers, department store owners. The entire newspaper is sold so thoroughly and at such a high price that it makes one feel that American newspapers are incorruptible."

    The poet saw that under capitalism, a person is evaluated not by his talent and ability, but by how many gold dollars he has. Mayakovsky spoke with biting irony about this gold dollar yardstick, which dominates "many aspects of American life, even some of the most subtle things."

    Through the magnificent facade of skyscrapers, the poet saw a miserable and gloomy America, an America withering in poverty and distress. He saw in the center of New York City "beggars searching for leftover food in garbage cans," here "only a fifteen-minute walk or a five-minute drive from the glorious Fifth Avenue and Broadway. The rain that fell yesterday and the day before accumulated in dirty puddles. Waste paper and garbage are ankle-deep, this is not an exaggeration, but really ankle-deep."

    He simultaneously saw America's technological achievements and the incredible backwardness of its social system.

    I thought I had gone forward fifteen thousand miles,
    But when I landed—I was seven years behind.

    The seven years referred to the great socialist October Revolution that had occurred in the poet's motherland seven years before.

    Every poem of Mayakovsky about America is based on some individual event and some personal observation, but at the same time all these poems depict a complete picture of the capitalist world. These poems are overflowing with mockery and sarcasm. The poem entitled "Brooklyn Bridge" is sarcastic throughout, its entire image and structure is based on this contrast—the technical achievements of bourgeois culture and its impossibility of being applied for the benefit of the working people. So the poet said, "In the future, only this bridge will look down on the wasteland of ruins." He knew that this "technical miracle" was also a place where men and women driven to despair by the capitalist system committed suicide. In this era of electricity and radio, "people without work jump into the Hudson River from here."

    Therefore, Mayakovsky's ironic conclusion drawn from his "discovery of America" is completely natural:

    As for me, regarding America,
    I'd rather cover it up and not look at it
    And wash it up a little,
    Then, for the second time,
    Go and discover it.

    America's technological "progress" has caused millions of workers to become unemployed and impoverished. While the Soviet Union's technological progress has raised the living standards of the people. The poet declared with a feeling of infinite pride:

    We are immensely large
    And powerfully majestic Edisons.
    But for us the most important thing,
    And this must absolutely not be buried,
    For us the most important thing is
    Our glorious Soviet country,
    Soviet freedom,
    Soviet sun,
    Soviet flag.

    In the poem "Scared the Americans," Mayakovsky said that the Soviet people—

    ...Cannot be measured
    By the standards of America.
    They can never be tempted with gold dollars or rubles.

    Observing the daily life of the world's largest bourgeois country, seeing how human dignity is trampled everywhere, the poet was filled with indignation. This feeling of indignation runs through all of his poems and essays about America. His powerful lyric poems describing the humble status of women in bourgeois society ("Miss and Woolworths," "Syphilis," etc.) express this feeling especially to its peak. He saw how cruelly Americans were exploited, and said:

    If your eyes are blind to the enemy,
    If your strength of hatred
    Has weakened—then come,
    To here,
    To New York.

    This is a summary of Mayakovsky's impressions of America.

    The final paragraphs of his essays about America are indeed prophetic:

    "The Rochambeau is berthed in the Harvard dock... The shore is crowded with crippled beggars and urchins.

    "The passengers throw small change onto the shore (which is considered 'lucky'), and the urchins pounce on these coins, pushing and shoving, tearing each other's ragged clothes with their teeth and hands.

    "The Americans on board secretly laugh and snap pictures.

    "These beggars before me are equal to a symbol of what is prepared for the future of Europe, unless she stops wagging her tail before Americans and any money."

    This is perhaps speaking of those big bosses in New York and Washington today who are trying to enslave and strangle the people of Europe with the "aid" of the Marshall Plan; perhaps speaking of those servants of imperialism who obsequiously allow the frenzied capitalists to tighten the noose around the necks of European nations.

    In the struggle between two worlds and two social systems, Mayakovsky emerged as a conscious socialist warrior. Therefore, he believed that his crossing the border was by no means merely a change in geographical location. It is no accident that the "Poem about the Soviet Passport," one of the most brilliant collections of poems in all of his works about foreign travel, takes this as its theme.

    Infinite love for the motherland and infinite hatred for the imperialist beast, pride in knowing that he belongs to a country that has achieved epoch-making progress of world significance by establishing a new socialist system, belongs to a country with infinite potential in material and spiritual development—these are the emotions that give soul to "Poem about the Soviet Passport."

    Mayakovsky always believed that serious work in the field of ​​poetry must be based on a careful study of life, studying it in all its complex and diverse forms of development. The poet's entire writing shows a passionate and active attitude towards life, and a deep knowledge of reality. His ability to see the general from the particular gives his poems a powerful persuasiveness.

    In satirical sketches about American life such as "Foreign Snares," "Midnight Chimes," and "Cross Section of a Skyscraper," one can hear the powerful voice of the warrior, advocating "turning racial anger into class anger," and an affirmation of Soviet national pride. This is particularly evident in "Poem about the Soviet Passport." In this collection of poems, the poet proudly declares:

    Read and envy me,
    I am—a Soviet citizen.

    Mayakovsky's experience has helped Soviet poets create works filled with enthusiasm for the struggle against the enemies of the Soviet Union and all progressive mankind, filled with enthusiasm for the struggle against the reactionary fascist-minded bourgeoisie of modern America, Britain and France.

    In Simonov's collection of poems "Friends and Enemies," it is not difficult to find traces of Mayakovsky's tradition. In M. Bazhan's collection of poems "British Impressions" there is sharp political satire, in which he rebukes the Labour government for subordinating the national interests of the British people to the US dollar. Mirzo Tursun-Zade, in his "Indian Ballads" and his latest collection of poems about India, denounces the British colonists, who have abandoned all "democratic" decorations and unscrupulously plunder and strangle the people of the East.

    The poems of Simonov, Bazhan, Tursun-Zade and many other poets inherit the tradition of Mayakovsky, they are overflowing with a sincere, passionate, and partisan attitude towards events, people and facts, which is the basic characteristic of Mayakovsky's poems.

    American propaganda has painstakingly created public opinion, saying that the United States is the freest and most democratic country in the world. Today, when the countries under the Marshall Plan are flooded with this boasting propaganda, we will especially think of Mayakovsky, and how he ruthlessly exposed the deception of American democracy, how he exposed the hypocrisy and vulgarity of American bourgeois society, the corrupt essence of American newspapers and the stagnation of American bourgeois art.

专栏：

    马雅柯夫斯基论美国
    马雅柯夫斯基有九次离开祖国到国外旅行。他的最长和最大的一次游历是在一九二五年夏天，访问了西班牙、墨西哥和美国。这次周游的结果是一大批诗章和游记，这些后来陆续在“西班牙”、“海洋”、“古巴雪茄烟”、“墨西哥”、“美国”等标题之下发表，并且收进了《我发现美洲》这个集子。
    在外国旅行的当儿，马雅柯夫斯基总是锐利地警觉到他那作为世界上第一个社会主义国家的诗人的责任。
    “我是诗的大使，”他骄傲地写过。
    对祖国的爱渗透在马雅柯夫斯基所有的作品里。他的最热情和最有力的诗句就是呈献给这种伟大情绪的。
    对社会主义国家的爱，这一主题，在他的关于外国的诗和散文里突现得甚至更加明朗。在苏联国土之外时，他把自己看成新世界的一个使者，而骄傲于他的国家的优越，这个国家，已经驾乎资本主义诸国之上，而实现了人类的最崇高的理想。
    马雅柯夫斯基对资产阶级文化的态度，是伟大的俄罗斯文学传统的一个继承和发展。
    卓越的俄罗斯作家和革命家拉吉希切夫，在短诗《自由》里，欢呼美国人民争取独立的斗争，痛斥“新世界”统治者们的暴虐和掠夺。他看到了与美国资产阶级民主并生的贫穷和奴役。他讽刺地把美国称作：“一个幸福的地方，那儿百来个洋洋得意的人们沉溺在奢侈之中，而千千万万的人民却没有最起码的生存手段和遮避寒暑的房屋。”
    普希金用深刻的洞察力，看出在他那时代的美国，人类的最高尚的动机和抱负被粗暴地压制着。他在那篇写于一八二六年的《约翰·坦诺尔》里叱责了美国民主和文化的“不能忍受的专制”，“无情的自私自利主义”，和“可憎厌的犬儒主义”。
    一八四○到一八六○这一时期的革命民主派的最优秀的代表们——柏林斯基、赫尔岑和车尔尼舍夫斯基也同样暴露了美国资产阶级“自由”的虚伪和腐败的性质。车尔尼舍夫斯基指出了美国资产阶级民主的奴隶制度和虚伪的骗局。他认为奴隶制度是美国的基本罪恶，认为那大吹大擂的美国民主是有限制的和假的，是依附钱袋的。他把资产阶级美国的报纸叫作“以股票交易的算盘作基础的纯粹投机”。
    著名的民主作家柯洛连柯，在他的小说《没有语言》（一八六五年）和他的叫做《美国游记》的散文集里，把美国扯谎的自我宣传家们所描画的神气活现的“新世界”的图画同这个国家的实际情形——资产阶级民主的虚伪性，法庭和报纸的腐化，美国殖民家的兽性和粗野、虚伪和残酷，以及盛行于美国的警察恐怖——作了一番对照。
    一九○六年去过美国的高尔基，称纽约为“黄色魔鬼的城市”。高尔基嘲笑那些自称“超于政治”和“不受金钱支配”的受雇佣的美国作家们的虚伪姿态恰恰暴露了美国报纸的拜金主义、文化艺术的退化、以及美国资产阶级社会的虚伪和粗俗。
    马雅柯夫斯基后于高尔基十九年“发现”了美国。他在“繁荣时代”的表面下看到一个被尖锐的社会矛盾所撕裂的国家，一批被股票交易所大王们所统治的贫困不堪的受压迫的人民。
    面临着有摩天大楼和巨大工程的美国，看着纽约的桥梁、地下铁道和空中铁道的马雅柯夫斯基，从来没有忘记这一切都是“伟大的劳动军”所创造，但却被资产阶级所占有，用以服务于他们的自私目的。对照着这种背景，那个“深渊已经被一座直通共产主义的桥梁所跨越”的苏维埃祖国的形象，就在这位诗人的心灵中愈加庄严地涌现出来了。
    马雅柯夫斯基的尖锐的观察力，他的结合着对事物的热烈兴趣的，战士和爱国者的热情天性，产生了有巨大思想深度和感染力的诗的意象。
    诗人指出，在美国，寄生的少数人对劳苦的多数人进行可怕的剥削。诗人指斥福特主义是一种精妙的剥削制度，他揭露了：福特工厂的非人情况正足以表示美国的技术并没有减轻人的劳动，反而是耗尽了他们的力量。
    诗人指斥了资本主义美国的民族歧视和种族歧视。他忿怒地描写那些剥夺了被压迫人民的基本生存权利的帝国主义大好佬们：
    高高在上的是官儿们，
    被钻石的光芒所照耀。
    下面是人民。
    光着屁股，没有裤子遮掩；
    第一是根本没有，
    其次呢——他们是印地安人：
    禁止穿裤子。
    马雅柯夫斯基认为美国是帝国主义反动势力的最后堡垒。“可能发生这样的事，”他写，“美国也许会变成资产阶级的绝望事业的最后的武装保卫者——那末历史就能够写出像威尔斯的《世界大战》那样一部紧张的小说了。”
    在暴露资产阶级民主的反人民的性质时，马雅柯夫斯基指出了“资产阶级自由”的虚伪，资产阶级文化和道德的拜金主义和欺骗。“那些报纸，”马雅柯夫斯基说，“是托辣斯所创办的，托辣斯、托辣斯的老板们把它们卖给了广告家们、百货商店的店主们。整个报纸都被卖得那么彻底，而且卖价那么昂贵，以致使人觉得美国报纸是不受贿赂的了。”
    诗人看到在资本主义之下，对于一个人的评价不是看他的天才和能力，而是看他有多少金元。马雅柯夫斯基带着辛辣的讽刺说到这个金元尺码，它统治着“美国生活中的许多方面，甚至某些最微妙的东西。”
    诗人透过摩天大楼的堂皇门面，看到一个悲惨的和愁眉苦脸的美国，一个在贫困和愁苦之中憔悴下去的美国。他在纽约市中心看到“乞丐们在垃圾桶里搜索残剩食物”，这儿“离开辉煌的第五街和百老汇只有十五分钟步行或五分钟乘车的距离。昨天和前天下的雨积在肮脏的水潭里。废纸和废物深没足踝，这不是过甚其辞，而是实实在在的深没足踝。”
    他同时看到了美国的技术上的成就和它的社会制度的难以置信的落后。
    我原以为我向前走了一万五千里，
    可是我登了岸——落后了七年。
    所谓七年，是指七年前在诗人的祖国发生了伟大的社会主义十月革命。
    马雅柯夫斯基关于美国的每一首诗，都是以某种个别事件和某种个人观察为根据的，但是同时整个的这些诗作却描绘了一幅完整无遗的资本主义世界的图画。这些诗洋溢着嘲讽和讥刺。那篇以《勃洛克林桥》为题的诗，从头到尾都是讽刺的调子，它的整个的形象和结构是建立在这一对照上——资产阶级文化的技术成就及其应用于为劳动人民利益的不可能。所以诗人说，“将来只有这座桥孤另另地俯视着废墟的荒尘吧。”他知道这个“技术的奇迹”同时也就是那些被资本主义制度驱于绝望的男女们实行自杀的场所。在这个电气和无线电的时代，“没有工做的人们就从这里跳进赫得森河”。
    因此，马雅柯夫斯基从他的“发现美国”所得出的讽刺的结论，是完全自然的：
    我呢，对于美国，
    我倒宁愿把它遮起来不看
    并且稍为把它洗刷一番，
    然后，等第二次，
    去把它发现。
    美国的技术“进步”造成了几百万工人的失业和穷困。而苏联的技术进步却提高了人民的生活水平。诗人带着无限骄傲的感觉宣布说：
    我们是规模大得无比的
    力量雄伟的爱迪生们。
    但是对于我们最最重要的，
    而这是绝对不能埋没的，
    对于我们最最重要的是
    我们的光荣的苏维埃国家，
    苏维埃自由，
    苏维埃太阳，
    苏维埃旗帜。
    在《吓坏了美国人》这首诗里，马雅柯夫斯基说苏维埃人民——
    ……是美国的尺码
    所不能衡量的。
    他们决不能够被诱以金元或卢布。
    观察着世界最大资产阶级国家的日常生活，看到人类的尊严如何到处受着践踏，诗人是忿怒如焚了。这种愤慨的感觉贯穿在他的所有的关于美国的诗和散文里。他的描写资产阶级社会里妇女的卑微地位的有力抒情诗（“小姐和吴尔华士”，“梅毒”，等），表现这种感觉尤其是达到了顶点。他看到在美国人被人剥削得如何残酷，说：
    假如你的眼睛对敌人盲目，
    假如你的仇恨的力量，
    已经减弱——那末来吧，
    到这儿，
    到纽约。
    这就是马雅柯夫斯基对美国的印象的概括。
    他的关于美国的散文的结尾几段的确是预言性的：
    “罗尚波号泊在哈佛船坞了……岸上挤满了做乞丐的跛子们和顽童们。
    “旅客们把零钱丢到岸上（这是被认为‘幸运’的），顽童们便扑向这些零钱，你推我挤，互相用牙和手扯着别人的破衣服。
    “乘船的美国人暗暗发笑，嚓嚓地拍照片。
    “这些乞丐在我面前就等于那为欧洲的将来所准备下的东西的一个象征，除非她停止在美国人和任何金钱面前摇尾乞怜。”
    这也许是说着了今天这些企图用马歇尔计划的“援助”来奴役和扼死欧洲人民的纽约和华盛顿的大老板们；也许是说着了那些帝国主义的奴仆，他们诏媚地允许热狂的资本家们抽紧那套在欧洲民族脖子上的圈套。
    在两个世界两个社会制度的斗争里，马雅柯夫斯基作为一个自觉的社会主义战士而出现。所以他认为他的越过国境决不仅仅是地理位置的改变。他的全部关于国外旅行的作品里最精彩的一个诗集“关于苏维埃护照的诗”把这作为主题，并不是偶然的。
    对祖国的无限的爱和对帝国主义猛兽的无限的恨，骄傲于知道自己属于一个由于建立了新的社会主义制度而达到了有世界意义的划时代进步的国家，属于一个在物质发展和精神发展方面有无穷潜力的国家——这些就是赋予“关于苏维埃护照的诗”以灵魂的情绪。
    马雅柯夫斯基始终相信诗歌领域的严肃工作必须基于对生活的慎重研究，从它的发展中的一切复杂和多样的形态研究它。诗人的全部写作都显出一种对生活的热情而积极的态度，和对现实的深刻知识。他的从特殊中看到一般的能力，使他的诗篇具有了强大的说服力。
    在《外国圈套》、《午夜钟声》、《一座摩天楼的横切面》这类关于美国生活的讽刺速写里，可以听到这位战士的强有力的声音，鼓吹“把种族忿怒化为阶级忿怒”，以及一种对于苏维埃民族骄傲心的肯定。这在“关于苏维埃护照的诗”里表现得尤其充分。诗人在这诗集里骄傲地宣布：
    读吧并且妒忌我吧，
    我是——一个苏联公民。
    马雅柯夫斯基的经验帮助了苏维埃诗人们创作充满了对苏维埃国家的敌人和一切进步人类的敌人作斗争的热情的作品，充满了对现代美国、英国和法国的反动的法西斯头脑的资产阶级作斗争的热情的作品。
    在西蒙诺夫的诗集《朋友和敌人》里，不难寻出马雅柯夫斯基传统的痕迹。在Ｍ·巴尚的诗集《英国印象》里有着尖锐的政治讽刺，他在这些诗里叱责工党政府使英国人民的民族利益从属于美元。米尔左·杜尔森——泽德，在他的《印度歌谣》和关于印度的最新诗集里，痛斥了不列颠殖民家们，他们放弃了一切“民主”的装饰品，肆无忌惮地掠夺和扼杀东方的人民。
    西蒙诺夫、巴尚、杜尔森—泽德和其他许多诗人们的诗篇承继了马雅柯夫斯基的传统，它们洋溢着对于事件、人民和事实的真挚的、热烈的、党性的态度，而这正是马雅柯夫斯基的诗作的基本特色。
    美国的宣传费尽心机地制造舆论，说美国是世界上最自由和最民主的国家。今天，当马歇尔计划下的诸国正泛滥着这种吹牛宣传的时候，我们就格外会想到马雅柯夫斯基，以及他如何无情地暴露了美国民主的骗局，如何揭发了美国资产阶级社会的伪善和庸俗，美国报纸的腐败本质和美国资产阶级艺术的停滞。
