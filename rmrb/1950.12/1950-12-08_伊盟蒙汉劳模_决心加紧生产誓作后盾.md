    League Labor Models of Mongolian and Han Nationalities
    Determined to Intensify Production as a Strong Backing
    [This Newspaper's News] All the Mongolian and Han labor models from the Ikh Chao League Autonomous Region of Suiyuan Province, who attended the first Labor Model Congress and Production Exhibition Conference, sent letters of respect and condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army aiding Korea and to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean People's Army. In their letter to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean People's Army, they said: You have raised the banner of justice to strike at these shameless aggressors—the American-Li bandit troops—in order to guarantee world peace and save the vast number of suffering working people. We believe that under the leadership of the great General Kim Il-sung, the heroic People's Army will surely push these dregs of humanity to the bottom of the sea and wipe them out completely. We pledge to be your strong backing and wish you a victorious and speedy completion of this great task.
    In the letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they said: Comrades: For the sake of human justice and world peace, you spare no sacrifice and hold the determination to win every battle and conquer every fortress, striking at the shameless aggressors—the American-Li bandit troops. You are the standard-bearers for guaranteeing world peace and the vanguard for digging graves for the enemy. We are determined to intensify production and pledge to be your strong backing. And we wish you an early completion of your mission.
