    Beijing Church Groups, Hospitals, and Schools
    Support Government Administration Council Decision
    Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Other Schools' Teachers and Students Support Schools Receiving U.S. Imperialist Subsidies
    [Report from this newspaper] Various church groups, hospitals, and schools in Beijing have successively published written opinions, fully endorsing the Government Administration Council's "Decision on the Policy Regarding the Handling of Cultural, Educational, and Relief Organizations and Religious Bodies Accepting American Subsidies." Teachers and students from Peking University, Beijing Normal University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Peking University Medical School have also written to this newspaper, expressing their willingness to actively assist groups, hospitals, and schools receiving American subsidies in implementing this decision.
    Pang Zikun, Chairman of the Beijing Christian Association, stated in his written opinion: "All Christian churches and groups in Beijing wholeheartedly support this policy of the government." He said, "Through this decision, our Christian churches in Beijing and throughout the country will be able to break the shackles imposed on us by American imperialism, enabling us to truly become independent!" Gao Shangren, General Secretary of the Beijing YMCA, said: "An independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous country cannot allow imperialists to use money to run schools, hospitals, churches, or any other undertakings, because using imperialist subsidies to run these things is inherently a form of humiliation, and it is certainly not our glory or honor. We wholeheartedly support this wise decision of the government." Zhang Zirong, Director of Beijing Daoji Hospital, stated in his written opinion: "In addition to strictly abiding by government laws and regulations for registration, our hospital has also decided to follow the policy of handling matters, highly promote the spirit of patriotism, closely integrate political thought with medical practice, and strive to the end for the medical cause of the Chinese people!" The opinion letter from Tongren Hospital also stated that they are willing to implement the policy set by the government and run the hospital even better. After seeing the Government Administration Council's decision, the teachers, students, and staff of Bridgman Girls' School immediately issued a declaration stating: "We firmly support this decision and will work hard to implement this measure as soon as possible!" They also said: "We are willing to overcome all possible difficulties and not allow these difficulties to become a burden on our government!" The teachers and students of Yu Ying Middle School also warmly welcomed this measure by the government. Just one day earlier, Huiwen Middle School had received 10,000 catties of millet subsidized by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education. Gao Fengsan, the principal of the school, said happily at a joint meeting of all faculty and staff: "The government not only thinks of solutions for us but also provides practical assistance. We have the confidence to completely break free from the shackles of American imperialism!"
    Feng Zhi and Wen Jiasi, professors of the Western Language Department of National Peking University, and the chairman of the university's student union, all stated that they are willing to stand at their cultural and educational posts and actively assist the government in implementing this decision, so as to thoroughly eliminate the imperialist influence of the United States on the cultural front. The Education Union and Student Union of National Beijing Normal University also issued a declaration on behalf of all teachers, students, and staff, supporting this decision. The Fu Jen Catholic University Labor Union and Student Union jointly sent a letter to this newspaper saying: "We, the entire faculty, students, and staff of Fu Jen Catholic University, who have been victorious in the struggle against imperialism and have been reborn, feel extremely excited about this measure taken by the government." Chen Yuan, the president of the university, expressed his hope that cultural, educational, and religious groups would work together to implement this measure. All teachers and students of Peking University Medical School believe that this decision has further promoted the close unity of the Chinese medical community. Dr. Lin Zhengang, Director of the Pathology Department, said: "In the past, our medical community was still somewhat controlled and restricted by imperialism. Now that this layer of restraint has also been removed, our Peking University Medical School can now better unite with hospitals and schools that have always been under the economic control of the American imperialists, and our medical education will definitely be run better." Many students from the school also wrote letters to students at Peking Union Medical College, expressing their congratulations and support.

    京市教会团体医院和学校
    拥护政务院决定
    北大师大等校师生支持受美帝津贴的学校等
    【本报讯】京市各教会团体、医院和学校，纷纷发表书面意见，完全拥护政务院所发布的“关于处理接受美国津贴的文化教育救济机关及宗教团体的方针的决定”；北大、师大、辅大和北大医学院师生并纷纷致函本报，愿努力协助受美国津贴的团体、医院和学校，实现这一决定。
    北京基督教联合会主席庞之焜的书面意见中说：“对于政府这一方针，北京各基督教教会和团体，无不竭诚拥护。”他说：“通过这一决定，我们北京以及全国的基督教会，都将借以挣断美帝加给我们的缰绳，使我们真正能够自主！”北京基督教青年会总干事高尚仁说：“一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的国家决不能容许帝国主义者拿钱来办学校、医院、教会以及其他任何事业，因为用帝国主义者的津贴来办这些事的本体就是一种污辱，那决不是我们的光荣和体面。我们竭诚拥护政府这种英明的决定。”北京道济医院院长张子荣的书面意见中表示：“我院除了恪守政府法令进行登记而外，并决定遵照处理方针，高度发扬爱国主义的精神，把政治思想与医疗业务密切结合起来，而为中国人民的医疗事业奋斗到底！”同仁医院的意见书中也表示，愿实现政府所定方针，将医院办得更好。贝满女中师生员工看到政务院这一决定后，即发表宣言表示：“我们坚决拥护这一决定，并且为尽早的实现这一措施而努力！”并说：“我们愿意克服一切可能遇到的困难，而不使这些困难成为我们政府的负担！”育英中学的师生也热烈欢迎政府这一措施。汇文中学早一天刚收到京市文教局补助的一万斤小米。该校校长高凤三在全校教职员联席会上欣喜地说：“政府不但替我们想法，还实际帮助我们。我们有信心完全摆脱美帝的羁绊！”
    国立北京大学西语系教授冯至、闻家驷及该校学生会主席都表示，愿站在文化教育岗位上，积极协助政府实现这一决定，以使在文化战线上彻底肃清美帝的侵略影响。国立北京师范大学教育工会及学生会，也代表全校师生员工发表了拥护这一决定的宣言。辅仁大学工会和学生会联名致函本报说：“我们曾和帝国主义斗争胜利而新生了的辅仁大学全体师生员工，对政府的这次措施更感到莫大的兴奋。”该校校长陈垣发表意见，希望文化教育宗教团体一致为实现这一措施而努力。北大医学院全体师生认为这一决定更促成了中国医学界的紧密团结。病理科主任林振纲大夫说：“过去我们医学界还多少受帝国主义的控制和限制，现在这一层束缚也去掉了，我们北医现在可以和以前一直受美帝经济控制的医院和学校更好地团结起来了，我们的医学教育一定会办得更好。”该校并有许多同学向协和医学院同学写信表示庆贺与支持。
