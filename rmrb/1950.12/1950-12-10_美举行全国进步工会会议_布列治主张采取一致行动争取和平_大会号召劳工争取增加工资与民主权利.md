Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: According to a Washington dispatch from Electrone Telegraph Agency on December 4th: The U.S. National Labor Conference, initiated by leaders of progressive labor unions not affiliated with the AFL or CIO, was held in Washington last week. It was attended by more than 800 union representatives from across the country. The purpose of the conference was to formulate a strong labor plan to defeat the American reactionaries' war bloc and their congressional lackeys' attacks on labor. The conference heard a report from Harry Bridges, leader of the West Coast longshoremen and Honorary President of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union. Bridges emphasized the necessity of taking united action to demand peace. The conference called on all workers to join the struggle for the following goals: to raise wages, defeat the impending wage freeze, reduce prices, control prices and rents, increase profit taxes, reduce income taxes for low-wage earners, abolish the McCarran Act, the Taft-Hartley Act, and other laws that infringe on democratic and labor rights, and defend the victims of anti-labor and anti-democratic persecution measures. The conference also formulated a plan for unified action among the leading bodies of major national unions.
