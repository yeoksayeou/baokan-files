    Anti-American, Aid-Korea Movement Enthusiastically Unfolding
    Through Current Affairs Study, the Political Awareness of People in Various Regions Has Increased; They Are Intensifying Production and Working Actively.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The movement to resist US aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country is gradually unfolding in Northeast China, Northwest China, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other regions. Large-scale current affairs propaganda has been carried out in the rural areas of Northeast China. In Liaoxi Province, 40,000 propagandists were organized with district and village cadres and primary school teachers as the backbone; most villages and hamlets held current affairs forums; and more than 3,000 rural amateur theater troupes throughout the province are touring and performing everywhere. In Heilongjiang Province, more than 28,000 propagandists are distributed in villages and hamlets of all sizes to carry out propaganda activities; more than 4,400 villages across the province have held mass meetings to report current affairs to farmers, and have organized youth, women, the elderly, and military families to hold current affairs forums. More than 800 propagandists trained by the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party are deployed in various counties to carry out propaganda activities, becoming the core force of rural propaganda work in the province. In Yushu County of the province, more than 1,700 blackboards regularly publish current affairs news. In the Korean ethnic areas of Yanbian counties, a surge in studying current affairs has been universally launched since 900 propagandists went to the countryside. Farmer propagandists in the Changbai Mountains area of Liaodong Province are conducting various propaganda activities using the real materials of US aircraft attacking local residents. First-level institutions in the Northwest Region, first-level institutions in Shaanxi Province, and first-level institutions in Xi'an have all been drawn into the upsurge of current affairs learning. The Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Democratic League General Association, and the Preparatory Committee of the Xi'an Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association have also held current affairs seminars one after another. The industrial and commercial circles in Xi'an actively responded to the patriotic call of Beijing merchants and opposed unscrupulous elements who engage in speculation and profiteering. When Muslim Ma Musheng prayed in the mosque, he enthusiastically promoted the truth of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to the Muslims. Northwest University, Northwest Party School and other schools plan to use current affairs learning as a long-term educational content. Xinjiang Nationalities Institute in Dihua City, Xinjiang Province, Xinjiang Provincial No. 1 Middle School, Lanzhou University in Gansu, Lanzhou Middle School and other schools generally carry out current affairs learning. Xinjiang Provincial No. 1 Normal School will list current affairs learning as a regular course. The Gansu Provincial Women's Middle School requires learning basic nursing knowledge. People from all walks of life in Wuhan generally held lectures, seminars and discussions on the issue of US imperialist aggression against Korea. Reading groups have been generally established in schools and rural areas in the suburbs. The Communist Youth League organizations in various factories have established propagandists to go deep into the workshops to explain current affairs, which has been warmly welcomed by the workers. The Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has selected more than 40 political teachers from public and private middle schools to take charge of political learning courses in their respective schools; and has also convened history teachers from various middle schools to study how to combine current affairs with teaching. People from all walks of life in Guangzhou have also conducted extensive current affairs study and propaganda.
    Before studying current affairs, many people in the above-mentioned areas did not have enough understanding of the essence of US imperialism and were unclear about the US imperialist aggression conspiracy.
    After studying and promoting current affairs, people in various regions generally have a preliminary correct understanding of the current situation and the essence of US imperialism, changed their paralysis and fear of the United States, saw the hideous face of US imperialism, aroused their hatred for US imperialism and their enthusiastic concern for the Korean People's Liberation War, and expressed their will with practical actions. In Northeast China, farmers volunteering to go to Korea to fight or serve as combat support have formed an unprecedented scale. Farmers who stayed in the rear are all engaged in production with peace of mind to strengthen the country's economic strength. In Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, the number of farmers engaged in sideline production in Sifu Village has increased from 25 in the past to more than 100. Farmers in Fushun County, Liaodong Province, delivered 6 million catties of public grain in five days. Most of the workers in the Sanqiao Railway Factory in Xi'an have joined the factory's Safety Committee to take on patrol, sentry, anti-espionage, and anti-special agent duties. More than 300 workers and Youth League members of the Northwest Textile Factory No. 1 in Xianyang wrote to the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, reporting on their production competition results. The Xining Leather Factory in Qinghai Province has been working overtime for one hour every day since November 13. Many cadres, students, workers, peasants, and citizens in Wuhan have signed up to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In the city, 214 male and female workers and middle school students have participated in public security work to strengthen social security. Larger factories in Guangzhou have launched patriotic production competitions. The Su Huiquan group of the No. 8 boiler of a certain power plant created a new record by operating at a load of 5,400 kilowatts without the need for oil residue to assist combustion. In the past, a load exceeding 4,500 kilowatts required oil residue to assist combustion. Under the leadership of Xu Jianming, a representative attending the National Model Workers Conference, the private Xinghua Battery Factory improved the battery polishing machine, increasing production by more than double. Workers in various factories actively organized pickets and fire brigades to strengthen factory security. Literary and art workers in the city launched a competition to create anti-US aggression and aid Korea propaganda works, supplying literary and artistic propaganda materials. The staff of government agencies are conducting work competitions, and work efficiency has been significantly improved.
