    Join the People's Air Force
    To the Editor:
    When I saw the joint decision of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council on recruiting young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools, I jumped up with joy. I felt that the day I had long awaited had arrived, and I couldn't help but shout, "I want to join the Air Force School!" At the same time, I kept thinking about everything in the past.
    I was born in a rural village in the mountains of western Hebei. At the age of six, I encountered the brutal war of aggression by Japanese imperialism. I remember that during the first "mopping-up" operation by the Japanese invaders, my family's house was completely burned down. We fled to the ravines, but the Japanese invaders continued to search the mountains; Japanese planes often circled overhead, firing machine guns and dropping bombs. A bomb fell beside me, killing my dear fellow villagers, and covering my face with yellow earth. From then on, I sowed the seeds of hatred for the Japanese invaders. I hoped that we could have airplanes to shoot down those frantically invading enemy planes.
    At the age of fifteen, I attended a normal school in a small county town. I was again subjected to strafing by American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes. Bullets hit beside me again, piercing the chest of an elderly citizen. People identified the bullets as American imperialist cannon bullets from the shell casings they picked up. From then on, I sowed the seeds of hatred for American imperialism. I realized that all imperialists are bad; I realized that without a strong air force, there would be no solid national defense.
    In order to strike at these imperialist bandits, I waited all day long for our people to build a strong air force of our own, and hoped that I would grow up quickly.
    The time has come! I am already nineteen years old; in order to consolidate national defense and for the safety of the people, the government has decided to recruit young students and young workers to participate in military cadre schools. This is completely proper and reasonable! Our young students should support this decision and actively respond to this call. I will be the first to sign up to join the Air Force School, devote myself to the Chinese People's Air Force, and fight to defend our airspace, defend our motherland, and defend our Chairman Mao!

### 参加人民空军打击侵略匪徒

    参加人民空军
    打击侵略匪徒编辑同志：
    当我看到中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院关于招收青年学生青年工人参加各种军事干部学校联合决定的时候，便高兴得跳了起来。我感到自己久已盼望的日子到来了，口里不由的喊出了：“我要加入空军学校！”同时脑子里在不住地想着过去的一切。
    我生在冀西山地的农村里。六岁上就遇着日本帝国主义残酷的侵略战争。我记得，在日寇第一次“扫荡”中，我家的房子就全部被烧光了。我们逃到山沟里，日寇还不断地进行搜山；日本飞机经常在上空盘旋，打机枪，扔炸弹。炸弹落在我的身边，炸死了我亲爱的乡亲，炸得我满脸黄土。从此我就种下了对日寇的仇恨。我盼望着咱们能够有飞机，去击落那些疯狂侵略的敌机。
    十五岁在一个小县城里上师范学校。又遭受到美制蒋机的扫射。子弹又打在我的身边，射穿了一个老年市民的胸膛。人们从拾得的子弹壳上辨明那是美帝的机关炮子弹。从此，我便又种下了对美帝的仇恨。我认清了所有的帝国主义都是坏的；我认清了没有强大的空军就没有巩固的国防。
    为了打击这些帝国主义匪徒，我整天地盼望着我们人民自己也建立起强大的空军，盼望着我赶快长大。
    时间到了！我已经十九岁了；为了巩固国防，为了人民的安全，政府决定招收青年学生和青年工人参加军事干部学校了。这是完全正当和合理的！我们青年学生们应该拥护这个决定，积极响应这个号召。我首先要报名加入空军学校，投身到中国人民的空军中去，为保卫我们的领空，保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的毛主席而奋斗！
