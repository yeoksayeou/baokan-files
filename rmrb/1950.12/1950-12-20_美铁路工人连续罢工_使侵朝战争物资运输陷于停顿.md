    US Railway Workers' Continuous Strikes
    Paralyze the Transport of War Materials for the Invasion of Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch] US railway workers held a series of strikes last week, paralyzing thousands of trains carrying materials for the Korean War and immediately affecting steel production. The strike began on the 11th in North Birmingham, Alabama; workers, disregarding the Truman government's seizure of the railways in August, which deemed strikes illegal, and without union approval, refused to report to work, demanding shorter working hours for 85,000 rail yard workers.
    On the 13th, the strike expanded to most of Chicago's railways, the largest railway hub in the United States, with 10,000 workers on strike. According to a spokesman for the Chicago Belt Railway, the strike paralyzed 5,000 trains passing through the area, 75 percent of which were carrying military supplies to the West Coast for shipment to Korea to support the US invading forces. The Associated Press admitted that the strike also affected the steel industry throughout the Chicago industrial area, forcing many blast furnaces to shut down and many factories to halt or reduce production.
    On the 14th, the strike spread to major cities such as St. Louis, Washington, and Baltimore, bringing the total number of affected railway hubs to seventeen. On the 15th, the strike continued to expand to New York and several other cities, and spread to drivers and stokers. In Chicago, none of the fifty-four car service crews on duty during the day reported to work. The strike continued to show signs of expanding.
    Under these circumstances, Truman once again resorted to high-handed measures on the 15th, ordering railway workers to resume work immediately or face prosecution for violating the "national interest," forcing the strike to end. The demands for improved wages and working conditions made by the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, to which the striking workers belonged, had been submitted nearly two years ago, but the railway owners had steadfastly refused to meet them. In August, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, together with the Brotherhood of Railway Car Clerks, organized a nationwide strike to support the workers' reasonable demands. However, Truman abused his so-called presidential prerogative, ordered the army to take over, and declared the strike illegal, undermining that strike.

### 美铁路工人连续罢工  使侵朝战争物资运输陷于停顿

    美铁路工人连续罢工
    使侵朝战争物资运输陷于停顿
    【新华社十九日讯】美国铁路工人曾于上星期举行了一连串罢工，使数千辆载运朝鲜战争物资的火车陷于停顿，并立即影响了钢铁的生产。罢工是十一日从亚拉巴马州的北明翰开始的；工人们不顾自杜鲁门政府八月间接管铁路以来罢工被认为非法，不经工会批准即不报到上工，要求为八万五千车场工人缩短工作时间。
    罢工于十三日扩大到美国最大铁路中心芝加哥的大部分铁路，该地罢工工人达一万人。据芝加哥环城铁路一发言人说，罢工使经过该地的五千辆火车陷于停顿，其中百分之七十五是载运军事物资去西海岸以便运往朝鲜支持美国侵略军的。美联社承认：罢工并使整个芝加哥工业区的钢工业受到影响，许多鼓风炉被迫封火，许多工厂停止或减少了生产。
    十四日，罢工又扩展到圣路易、华盛顿、巴尔的摩等重要城市，使波及的铁路中心站总数因此增至十七个。十五日罢工继续扩大到纽约及其他几个城市。并且扩及司机司炉。在芝加哥，白天值班的五十四个车务组的工人都未报到。罢工并有继续扩大之势。
    在这种情况下，杜鲁门于十五日又一次采取高压手段，下令强迫铁路工人立即复工，否则就将以违反“国家利益”论罪。使罢工被迫结束。按这次罢工工人所属的铁路员工兄弟会的改善工资与工作条件的要求，提出已近两年，铁路资方始终坚决拒绝。八月间，铁路员工兄弟会曾协同铁路车务员兄弟会组织全国大罢工，以支持工人的合理要求。但为杜鲁门滥用所谓总统特权，下令军队接收，并宣布罢工非法，破坏了那次罢工。
