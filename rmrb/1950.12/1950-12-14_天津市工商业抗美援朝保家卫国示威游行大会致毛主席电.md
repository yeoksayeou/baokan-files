To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

    We, all industrialists and businessmen of Tianjin, in order to crush the crazy and shameless aggression of U.S. imperialism, have previously put forward four specific tasks as our action framework for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. We guarantee that we will resolutely and thoroughly implement them.

    Today, we held a demonstration parade of more than 40,000 people to tell U.S. imperialism that we have recognized its aggressive nature. All sectors of the country have united as one to jointly strive to the end to complete the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country. We hereby send this telegram to express our highest respect!

    Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Circles' Demonstration Rally for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country
    November 30th

Chairman Mao's Reply

    To Mr. Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Bi Mingqi, Vice Chairman, Mr. Zhu Jisheng, and the 42,989 patriotic compatriots of the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles' Demonstration Rally for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country:

    I have seen your telegram of November 30th. You have recognized the reactionary nature of the U.S. imperialists' launching of aggression against China and Korea, you are not deceived by them, you are not afraid of their intimidation, you resolutely stand on the patriotic position of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and you held a righteous demonstration parade on November 30th, which is welcome. U.S. imperialism has carried out a lot of deceptive propaganda against the Chinese people, and all patriots should not believe these deceptive remarks. U.S. imperialism is invading Korea, invading China's Taiwan, bombing China's Northeast, and using various rogue methods to intimidate the Chinese people. All patriots should have the determination to resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism and not be intimidated by them. The heroic actions of the Chinese people's volunteers in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country are worthy of praise. It is completely correct for workers, peasants, intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen across the country, all patriots, to unite as one and oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism. I hope that all patriotic industrialists and businessmen in China, together with the masses of the people, will form a united front against imperialist aggression that is more consolidated than in the past. This foretells that the Chinese people will surely achieve the final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression.
                                  
                                  Mao Zedong, December 2, 1950

    天津市工商业抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行大会致毛主席电中央人民政府毛主席钧鉴：
    我们天津市全体工商业者，为了粉碎美帝疯狂无耻的侵略，前已提出了四项具体任务，作为我们抗美援朝的行动主范，我们保证，一定要坚决彻底地执行下去。
    今天我们又举行四万余人的示威大游行，告诉美帝，我们已经认清了它们的侵略本质。全国各阶层都已团结一致，共同为完成抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗到底，谨电。致以崇高的敬礼！
    天津市工商业抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行大会  十一月三十日
    毛主席复电
    天津市工商业联合会主任委员李烛尘先生，副主任委员毕鸣歧先生，朱继圣先生，天津市工商业界抗美援朝保家卫国示威游行大会的四万二千九百八十九位爱国同胞们：
    你们在十一月三十日给我的电报看到了。你们认清了美帝国主义者发动侵略中国和朝鲜的反动性质，你们不受他们的欺骗，不怕他们的恐吓，坚决地站在抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国立场上，并在十一月三十日举行了正义的示威游行，这是值得欢迎的。美国帝国主义者对于中国人民做了很多的欺骗宣传，一切爱国者都不应相信这些欺骗言论。美国帝国主义者侵略朝鲜，侵略中国的台湾，轰炸中国的东北，并使用各种流氓手段恐吓中国人民，一切爱国者都应有决心反抗美帝国主义的侵略，并不受他们的恐吓。中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿军的英勇行为，是值得赞扬的。全国工人、农民、知识分子及工商业家，凡属爱国者，一致团结起来，反对美帝国主义的侵略，是完全正确的。我希望全中国一切爱国的工商业家，和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，这就预示着中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争中一定要得到最后胜利。
                                  毛泽东  一九五○年十二月二日
