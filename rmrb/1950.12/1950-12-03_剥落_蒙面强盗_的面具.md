Unmasking the "Masked Bandit"
	Mao Dun

    I heard that Mark Twain's works in American school libraries have recently "disappeared." From this small incident, it can be seen that Truman and Acheson are, after all, a little smarter than their teacher Hitler; Hitler simply burned the works of Schiller and Heine in public. However, it also shows that Truman and Acheson, as loyal tools of the Wall Street tycoons, are no less neurotic than Hitler; because they finally regard even Mark Twain as a venomous snake!

    The reason why Mark Twain's works make Wall Street tycoons so "grief-stricken," I guess, is probably because they ruthlessly expose the faces of the American ruling group: a group of greedy wolves, biting each other to grab money, "Gold is their God, and how to seize gold is their religion." The American bourgeoisie has never been shy about money worship; "Two dollars is better than one dollar" is their motto. Why do they suddenly feel that Mark Twain's works have stung them? Since the start of the Korean War, the American bourgeois newspapers and magazines have continued to report in a smug tone how the bosses of all the military industries have made a fortune under the surge of military orders. But why can't they stand the old truths that Mark Twain said five or sixty years ago? There is only one reason to explain their contradictory behavior, that is, these greedy wolves, despite their fangs and claws, have reached a very serious level of neurasthenia! For example, on the one hand, they boast of possessing many super air fortresses, but on the other hand, they are afraid of a small dove of peace!

    There are many other manifestations of neurasthenia! According to the "National Guardian" published by the American Progressive Party: Harvard University's "John Reed Club" has been banned, and some radio programs have even inserted such intimidation: "If someone comes to your house to talk about peace, twist him and send him to the police!" Oh, isn't this almost equivalent to "those who whisper together should be executed in the marketplace"? Of course, the "John Reed Club," established to commemorate the author of "Ten Days That Shook the World," should be banned even more! It seems that this writer's works will not have better treatment, right? By analogy, the works of Dreiser and Jack London must also "disappear." H. Fast has been persecuted, J.H. Lawson, Trumbo and several other progressive filmmakers have been imprisoned, and their only crime is: opposing the American sixty families driving the American people down the road to destruction! As loyal Americans, Fast and others have the right and responsibility to prevent the sixty families who rule the United States from driving tens of thousands of American people to their deaths for the benefit of their small group. But the crime they got was betraying American interests! Isn't it clear enough: In the eyes of Truman and others, the interests of the sixty families are the interests of the United States, and whoever violates the interests of the sixty families is a traitor! What Truman, Acheson and others say about American democracy is actually like this.

    Truman, Acheson and others portray the United States as a "paradise" on earth, and American imperialism as a savior, and the people of the world are blessed by it. Now let's see what American imperialism has given us? In summary, there are two major categories: things that destroy people's bodies, and things that destroy people's minds. Regarding the former, it is the atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, super weapons, etc. by which the American war-mongers extort and embolden themselves. This situation is unbearable even for some of the more sober people within the American bourgeoisie. Heisler, who was once a Democratic congressional candidate and former naval officer, is naturally on the side of the government, but in his book, "After the War," he criticized the atomic strategy advocated and obsessed over by the American war-mongers:

    "Only the United States is building a strategic air force that plans to devastate cities in this way. In other words, the United States' concept of a strategic air force is to lead future wars to blind destruction.

    "We Americans are the inheritors of a degenerate concept of war, a concept that is our own, created by talented people who use science for destructive purposes. We must return to the correct concept of war. Today, Americans are driven by fictional hysteria and anti-communist war drums, and intimidated by the terrible weapons they have invented. They have become the only nation in the world that regards the manufacture of weapons for the systematic destruction of cities as the only magic weapon...The threat of war, coupled with the despicable boast of mass slaughter, has become the basic tool of today's foreign policy.

    "American leaders, if they unfortunately use this tool of blind destruction, will become the Genghis Khan of the atomic age, and their stench will last so long."

    What this "Jiao Da" of American monopoly capitalists said is indeed true: Americans today are, in the eyes of the whole world, murderous demons, cannibals. However, there is another thing that this "Jiao Da" is unwilling to say: these murderous demons are only the sixty families of the United States, and they are also the murderers of the American people, and the public enemies of the American people. If the American people want to wash away this bad name, and to save themselves and their nation, they should liquidate the sixty families of their own country. This "Jiao Da" also said that "American leaders... will become the Genghis Khan of the atomic age." Not "Genghis Khan" but "Hitler." American imperialism is now taking the same path that Hitler took, and the result will certainly not be as good as Hitler; after Hitler died, there was still that group of Wall Street people acting as his filial sons and virtuous grandsons, but after this group of filial sons and virtuous grandsons is eliminated, they will definitely be extinct!

    These filial sons and virtuous grandsons of Hitler also have more ingenious wishful thinking. They are also smart enough, and they can also see that their interests are absolutely incompatible with the interests of the vast majority of the American people; of course, they know in their hearts that military orders give them astronomical profits (in the second quarter of this year alone, it exceeded 46 percent of the same period last year), while giving the vast majority of people rising prices (the purchasing power of the dollar is now halved); of course, they know even more clearly that once the American youth, who have been anesthetized by their hysterical war cries and the deceptive propaganda of American-style "novel advertising," experience the harsh reality of the battlefield, they will learn their lesson and wake up: Therefore, this group of greedy and cowardly modern Caesars and modern Napoleons, who dream of conquering the world, wholeheartedly hope that the Western European countries will supply all the cannon fodder, fighting for American imperialism in the trenches, while the Americans, who regard themselves as world hegemons, are merely dropping atomic bombs from super air fortresses at an altitude of 40,000 feet on the homelands of the cannon fodder—the territories of the Western European countries that serve as battlefields!

    Such wishful thinking is really too clever, and too clever things do not necessarily have great possibilities. The Korean War provided an opportunity to test this too clever wishful thinking. The result was not very good. On this peninsula of 30 million people, after five months of fierce fighting, although American imperialism stole the banner of the United Nations, the satellite countries were not eager to send troops, and the main burden of the war had to be borne by American imperialism itself. Here, the Wall Street tycoons have once again "invented" novel mobilization slogans, namely: "Traveling to the East," "Korean girls," "High salaries," —portraying the war of aggression against Korea as the same as those adventurous and erotic "savage hunting" American movies. It is a pity that those American youth who are accustomed to pursuing excitement and do not use their brains did not realize that they had been fooled by the sixty families until they encountered the strong blows of the Korean People's Army. However, it was already too late, and they were either made into cannon fodder or became prisoners. In the war of aggression against Korea, the casualties of the US military, according to the numbers announced by the US government, are close to 30,000 so far; while in the Second World War, the total number of US military casualties was only about 300,000. By comparison, it can be seen how heavy and powerful the Korean People's Army's blows to American imperialism are! The only specialty of American imperialism in the Korean War was the indiscriminate bombing of cities, burning of villages, and slaughter of people. This vividly depicts the only nation, as Heisler said, that specializes in destroying cities and slaughtering innocent people! But such cruel means cannot make the Korean people submit, and the blood shed by such mass slaughter will eventually drown the invaders.

    Now let's take a look at another category of special products that American imperialism "dumps" to the world. This is the "things that destroy people's minds" mentioned above. Specifically, this category includes American-made movies, detective novels, yellow books, and comic strips that worship money, praise "busty jade legs," eulogize murderers and "masked bandits," encourage "adventurers," and promote American "Coca-Cola," "nylon stockings," and "glass bras." The Wall Street tycoons control huge publishing institutions, film factories, and broadcasting networks, and produce a large number of this whole set of things. This represents the so-called "American civilization." They use this whole set of things to anesthetize American youth, lure American youth to pursue sensual stimulation, degenerate from "human" to "beast," and become ignorant and blind instruments of American imperialist aggression. This whole set of things is also "dumped" to all parts of the world, with the purpose of corrupting the will of the youth of the invaded nations and making them obedient slaves. American movies, yellow books, detective novels, etc., are the precursors of American-made killing weapons!

    Truman and others shamelessly brag about their "American way of life." Praising women's thighs, eulogizing "masked bandits," etc., is one side of the "American way of life." The "American way of life" has many other sides. Discrimination against people of color, especially the abuse and murder of black people, is one side. In order to prevent the large quantities of grain stockpiled in the hands of Wall Street tycoons from falling in price, the American government restricts the acreage of certain crops, but at the same time, tens of thousands of American people are starving: this is another side of the "American way of life." It is known as the richest country in the world, but the completely unemployed and partially unemployed exceed 15 million; people have no purchasing power, and countless goods are piled up in warehouses and cannot be sold, but the stock exchange broker's newspaper openly says: "If peace is truly guaranteed, everything will collapse. At present, business is supported by military spending and military assistance to other countries." This is the biggest side of the "American way of life." Frenzy, exaggeration, lack of life purpose, demand for stimulation, stronger stimulation, and one in thirteen suffering from mental illness: this is also one side of the "American way of life." This way of life is not worth envying, we despise this way of life, we hate this way of life! However, American imperialism is determined to force others to adopt this way of life with airplanes and cannons!

    "Masked bandits" are probably an invention of American imperialism? American imperialism is the "masked bandit." On its mask, there is a pattern of "democracy" and a lace of "peace." It has also deceived some people. But when this bandit is about to go crazy, the mask can no longer work. Now everyone is becoming more and more clear: from openly protecting to openly employing the remnants of German and Japanese fascism, abusing and murdering black people, persecuting progressive writers, banning progressive organizations... All of this is American democracy! Aggression against Korea, aggression against Taiwan, indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities, slaughter of Korean people, invasion of our country's territorial airspace and waters, daily clamoring to bomb the Soviet Union with atomic bombs (recently even saying that they will bomb our country with atomic bombs), mass production of killing weapons, with the purpose of slaughtering cities... All of this is American peace!

    Mad and rogue, this is how a person is when they are at the end of their rope; this is also how a ruling group is when it is nearing its demise!

     剥落“蒙面强盗”的面具
       茅盾
    听说美国学校图书馆里的马克·吐温（MarkTwain）的著作，最近都忽然“失踪”了。从这件小事，也可以看出杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流，似乎毕竟比他们的老师希特勒稍稍聪明一点；希特勒是干干脆脆把席勒、海涅的作品当众焚烧了的。然而同时也可以看出来，作为华尔街大亨们忠实工具的杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流，其神经衰弱的程度并不比希特勒好一些；因为他们终于连马克·吐温也视同蛇蝎了！
    马克·吐温的作品之所以使得华尔街的大亨们如此地“痛心疾首”，据我猜想起来，大概是因为它无情地暴露了美国统治集团的面目：一群贪婪的狼，为了争夺金钱而互相咬噬，“黄金，是他们的上帝，如何攫得黄金，就是他们的宗教。”拜金主义，美国的资产阶级本来并不讳言，“两块钱比一块钱好”是他们的座右铭，为什么现在他们忽然觉得马克·吐温的作品刺痛了他们呢？侵略朝鲜战争开始以来，美国资产阶级的报章杂志继续不断地用了洋洋自得的口吻报道着一切军火工业的老板们在军火定单涌到之下如何大发其财，可是他们对于马克·吐温的远在五六十年前所说的老实话怎么倒又受不住了？只有一个理由可以解释他们的矛盾行为，就是这些贪婪的狼尽管那样张牙舞爪，然而神经衰弱确已到了极严重的程度！比方说，他们一方面自吹拥有多少超级空中堡垒，然而一方面又害怕一只小小的和平鸽！
    神经衰弱的表现还多得很呢！据美国进步党发刊的《民族卫报》所登载的消息：哈佛大学的“约翰·李特俱乐部”被取缔了，而有些地方的无线电广播节目中间竟插进了这样的恫吓：“如果有人到你家里谈和平，就扭他送交警察！”哦，这不是差不多等于“偶语者弃市”么？那自然，为了纪念“震撼世界的十日”的作者而成立的“约翰·李特俱乐部”更该查禁了！想来这位作家的作品也不会有较好的待遇吧？依此类推，德莱赛和杰克·伦敦的作品一定也要“失踪”的。法斯脱（H.Fast）受了迫害，劳逊（J.H.Lawson），托伦波（Trumbo）以及其他几位进步的电影工作者被囚禁了，他们的唯一的罪状不过是：反对美国的六十家族把美国人民往毁灭的路上赶！作为忠实的美国人，法斯脱他们有权利有责任阻止那统治美国的六十家族为了他们这小集团的利益而驱迫万万千千的美国人民走上死亡的道路。可是他们所得的罪名却是背叛美国利益！难道不够明白么：在杜鲁门之流看来，六十家族的利益就是美国的利益，谁违反了六十家族的利益，就是叛国！杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流嘴巴里的什么美国的民主，实际上就是这样的。
    杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流，把美国说成是世界上的“乐园”，把美帝国主义说成是救苦救难的观世音，全世界人民都蒙受它的福佑。现在就来看看美帝国主义给了我们什么东西？归纳起来，这是两大类：毁灭人们肉体的东西，和毁灭人们精神的东西。关于前者，就是美国战争贩子们借以敲诈并自壮其胆的原子弹、氢弹、超级武器等等。这种情形，甚至于连美国资产阶级内部稍为清醒些的人们也看不入眼。曾经是民主党的国会议员候选人，前海军军官，海斯勒，他自然是政府方面的人了，可是他在他的一本名为《战后余生》的书中，对于美国战争贩子们所鼓吹而且醉心的原子战略，作了这样的批评：
    “只有美国是在建立一支计划着如此蹂躏城市的战略空军，换言之，美国对战略空军的概念，就是把未来的战争导向了盲目的毁灭。
    “我们美国人是一种堕落的战争概念的继承者，这种概念，是我们自己的，把科学用于破坏之途的天才人物们所搞出来的。我们必须回到正确的战争概念上来。今天，美国人被虚构的歇斯底里和反共的战鼓所驱策着，被自己所发明的可怖武器所恫吓着。他们已经成为世界上唯一的民族，把制造有系统地毁灭城市的武器，当作唯一的法宝……战争威胁，加上大量屠杀的卑鄙的牛皮，已经成为今天外交政策的基本工具。
    “美国的领袖，如果倒霉地使用了这盲目破坏的工具，将成为原子世纪的成吉思汗，并且遗臭也会如此长久的。”
    这一位美国独占资本家们的“焦大”的说话，倒也是确实的：美国人今天在全世界的眼中，就是杀人魔王，是吃人的生番。然而还有一句话这位“焦大”却不肯说：这些杀人魔王只是美国的六十家族，而且他们也是美国人民的屠杀者，也是美国人民的公敌。美国人民如果要洗刷这个恶名，要挽救自己和自己的民族，便该对本国的六十家族进行清算。这位“焦大”又说“美国的领袖……将成为原子世纪的成吉思汗”。不是“成吉思汗”而是“希特勒”。美帝现在走的正是希特勒所走过的路，而其结果一定不如希特勒；希特勒死了以后还有华尔街那一群做他的孝子贤孙，但这一群孝子贤孙消灭了以后是一定从此绝种的！
    这些希特勒的孝子贤孙也还有更巧妙的如意算盘。他们也还够聪明，也还看得到他们的利益是和美国极大多数人民的利益是绝对不相容的；他们当然心中有数，军事定单给他们自己的，是天文数字的利润（单是今年第二季就比去年同期，超过了百分之四十六），而给极大多数人民的却是物价的步步高升（今天美元的购买力降低了一半）；他们自然更清楚地知道，被他们的歇斯底里的战争叫嚣和美国式的“新奇广告术”的欺骗宣传所麻醉了的美国青年一旦体验了战地的严酷现实，是会接受教训而清醒起来的：因此，这一群贪婪而又卑怯的梦想着征服世界的现代凯撒和现代拿破仑，一心期望西欧各国供给全部炮灰，在战壕里为美帝卖命，而以世界霸主自命的美国人只不过驾着超级空中堡垒在四万英尺的高空把原子弹扔在炮灰们的家乡——作为战场的西欧各国的国土！
    这样的如意算盘，真是太巧妙了，太巧妙的东西，可能性不一定大。朝鲜战争给这个太巧妙的如意算盘提供了一个考验的机会。结果可是不太好。在这三千万人的半岛上，恶战了五个月，美帝虽然盗用了联合国的旗帜，仆从国家出兵却不踊跃，主要的战争担子不得不由美帝自家来挑。在这里，华尔街的大亨们又“发明”了新奇的动员的口号，这就是：“游历东方”，“朝鲜姑娘”，“高厚薪饷”，——把侵略朝鲜的战争描写得就像那些冒险又兼色情的“蛮荒猎艳”式的美国电影一样。可怜那些惯于追求刺激而不会动脑筋的美国青年，直到碰上了朝鲜人民军的坚强打击，这才觉得上了六十家族的当，然而已经晚了，不是做了炮灰，就是当了俘虏了。在侵略朝鲜的战争中，美军的死伤到现在为止，据美政府公布的数目就将近三万；而在第二次世界大战中，美军死伤的总数也不过三十万光景，两相比较，就可以知道朝鲜人民军对于美帝的打击是多么的沉重有力了！朝鲜战争中美帝唯一的拿手戏就是滥炸城市，焚掠乡村，屠杀人民。这就活生生画出了海斯勒所说的专以毁灭城市、屠杀无辜人民为能事的唯一的民族！但是这样残酷的手段并不能使得朝鲜人民屈服，这样大量屠杀所流的血，最后一定会将侵略者淹死。
    现在再看看美帝国主义“倾销”到全世界的又一类的特产品。这就是上面提到过的“毁灭人们精神的东西”。具体说来，这一类就是崇拜金元、赞美“酥胸玉腿”，歌颂杀人犯与“蒙面强盗”，鼓励“冒险家”，宣传美国的“可口可乐”、“尼龙袜子”、“玻璃奶罩”等等的美国制造的电影，侦探小说，黄色读物，和连环图画。华尔街的大亨们掌握着庞大无比的出版机构，影片厂和广播网，大量生产这一整套的东西。这就代表了所谓“美国文明”。他们用这一整套的东西麻醉着美国青年，引诱美国青年追求着官能的刺激，从“人”堕落到“兽”，无知而盲目地成为美帝侵略的横暴的工具。这一整套的东西又“倾销”到世界各处，目的在于腐蚀被侵略民族的青年们的意志，使他们成为驯顺的奴隶。美制电影，黄色读物，侦探小说等等，就是美制的杀人武器的先驱！
    杜鲁门之流大言不惭地狂吹他们的“美国生活方式”。赞美女人大腿，歌颂“蒙面强盗”等等，就是“美国生活方式”的一面。“美国生活方式”还有其他许多面。歧视有色人种，特别是虐杀黑人，这是一面。为了华尔街大亨们手里囤积的大批粮食不至于跌价，美国政府限制若干农作物的播种面积，然而同时万万千千美国人民却在挨饿：这又是“美国生活方式”的一面。号称全世界最富有的国家，然而完全失业和部分失业者超过一千五百万；人民没有购买力，无数货物堆在仓库里销售不出，然而交易所经纪人的机关报却公开说：“假如和平真正获得保障，一切都要垮台。目前，生意是靠军事开支和对他国的军事援助来支持的。”这是“美国生活方式”的最大的一面。狂躁、夸诞、没有生活目的，要求刺激、更强烈的刺激，十三人中总有一个是患神经病的：这也是“美国生活方式”的一面。这种生活方式并不值得羡慕，我们鄙弃这种生活方式，我们憎恨这种生活方式！然而美帝国主义决心要用飞机大炮强迫别人奉行这种生活方式！
    “蒙面强盗”这种东西，大概是美帝国主义发明的罢？美帝国主义正就是“蒙面强盗”。它这面具上，画着“民主”的图案，又加上“和平”的花边，它也曾欺骗过一些人。可是这个强盗快到发疯的时候，假面具也不能再起作用，现在大家都一天一天更加明白起来了：由公开庇护而至公开起用德日法西斯余孽，虐杀黑人，迫害进步作家，取缔进步团体……凡此等等，就是美帝的民主！侵略朝鲜，侵略台湾，滥炸和平城市，屠杀朝鲜人民，侵犯我国领空领海，天天叫嚣着要用原子弹轰炸苏联（最近还说要用原子弹轰炸我国），大量制造杀人武器，以屠城为目的，……凡此等等，就是美帝的和平！
    疯狂而又无赖，一个人到了日暮途穷的时候就是这样的；一个统治集团到了临近灭亡的时候也是这样的！
                            十一、十五。
