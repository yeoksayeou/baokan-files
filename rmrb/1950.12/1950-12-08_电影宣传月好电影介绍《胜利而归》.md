    Good Movies Recommended for Movie Promotion Month: "Return to Victory"
    The theme of "Return to Victory" clearly indicates to the people that first, they must firmly establish their revolutionary stance and recognize the enemy; second, they must not succumb to any difficulties or be swayed by threats and inducements. For the sake of the motherland, and for themselves, they must persevere in the struggle to the end, "enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens," to defeat the enemy with a more resolute determination and achieve the liberation of the motherland. This film embodies this theme, and it is written through the story of a Latvian patriotic youth fighting against German fascist Germany.
    Fascist Germany frantically attacked Latvia, and after suffering fatal blows from the people's anti-aggression armed forces, Germany used the trick of sowing discord, spreading rumors, and slander to undermine the fighting strength of the people's army. But the fascist conspiracy could not overcome Latvia's firm will to love its motherland, and its deceitful tricks of threats and inducements were crushed by the people. We see that the people of Latvia are like this, and the people of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union are even more so. All peace-loving and democratic people around the world are like this.
    No matter how crazy American imperialism is, it will eventually be unable to escape the people's justice. In the end, it will not only suffer the same defeat as fascist Germany, but it will also be defeated more shamefully than the German invaders. The great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in aiding Korea has already proven this.
    But on the other hand, we must also be more vigilant and prevent the conspiracy activities of American imperialism. We must unite in our own camp with an iron will to complete the historical task, like Algusts. If we ever encounter something like what Algusts encountered, we should keep in mind the correct instruction: "A person who dedicates himself to the revolution should know that his life belongs to the revolution, and his thoughts must also belong to the revolution..." Like Algusts, adhere to one's own revolutionary stance and ideals, without wavering, compromising, or surrendering, and overcome all difficulties until "Return to Victory."

    电影宣传月好电影介绍《胜利而归》
    《胜利而归》的主题思想很明确的指示给人民，第一要坚定自己的革命立场，认清敌人；第二不为任何困难所屈服，不为威胁利诱所动摇。为祖国，也是为自己坚持斗争到底，要“忍辱负重”，以更坚决的决心去打垮敌人，以获取祖国的解放。本片所体现的就是这一个主题思想，它是通过一个拉脱维亚的爱国青年与德国法西斯德国作斗争的故事而写出的。
    法西斯德国疯狂地向拉脱维亚进攻，不断受到人民反侵略武装的致命打击后，于是德国就用挑拨离间造谣中伤的诡计，阴谋瓦解人民军队的战斗力量。但法西斯的阴谋战不过拉脱维亚爱祖国的坚定意志，它的威胁利诱的鬼蜮伎俩被人民所粉碎了。我们看到拉脱维亚的人民如此，朝鲜、中国、苏联的人民更是如此。全世界爱好和平民主的人民，都是如此。
    不管美帝是如何的疯狂，终将难逃人民的法网，最后非但要像法西斯德国一样的惨败，且较之德寇惨败得更可耻。我国援朝志愿军与朝鲜人民军的伟大胜利已经证明了这一点。
    但另一方面，我们也更要提高警惕，防止美帝的阴谋活动，在自己的阵营里要团结，以钢铁般的意志，完成历史任务，像阿尔固斯特一样。假如万一要遇到像阿尔固斯特所遇到的事情，我们就应该牢记着：“一个人要献身于革命，就该知道他的生命是属于革命了，他的思想也要属于革命了………”的正确指示。像阿尔固斯特一样，坚持自己的革命立场、理想，不动摇、不妥协、不投降，克服一切困难，直到《胜利而归》。
