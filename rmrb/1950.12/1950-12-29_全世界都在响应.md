    The Whole World Responds
    Guo Moruo
    Since the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea at the end of June, our movement to defend world peace and our movement to oppose American aggression have merged into one.

    Our movement is not only propaganda using words and writing, but also action using blood and lives. This is our sacred struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

    Our resistance against America and aid to Korea is not only to protect our homes and defend our country, but also to defend peace in Asia, defend world peace, defend the culture of all mankind, and defend the lives of all mankind.

    Our lofty patriotic action is also a lofty internationalist action, which has been responded to by the whole world at the Second Warsaw Peace Congress.

    The Second Warsaw Peace Congress and its General Assembly fully adopted the five proposals put forward by the Chinese people. The spirit of the various resolutions of the Second Congress and its General Assembly can be summarized in one sentence: "Peace cannot be waited for; it must be fought for."

    To defend world peace today, we must oppose American aggression. This is also clearly expressed in the various resolutions of the Second Congress and its General Assembly.

    Therefore, we can say that, on a global scale, the movement to defend world peace and the movement to oppose American aggression have also merged into one.

    It is our sacred movement of resisting America and aiding Korea that has inspired the Second Congress and its General Assembly, inspired the peace-loving people of the whole world, and raised the world peace movement to a new level.

    Therefore, our resistance against America and aid to Korea can be said to be implementing the resolutions of the Second Congress and its General Assembly today.

    Our just struggle, with one victory after another, has severely hit the U.S. imperialists who vainly attempt to dominate the world, not only defending peace in Asia but also defending world peace.

    Let us further expand and deepen our movement, and further expand and consolidate our victory!

    If the aggressive troops of U.S. imperialism do not withdraw, drive them out of Korea, drive them out of Taiwan! Otherwise, bury them in the Korean Strait, bury them in the Taiwan Strait!

    The whole world is responding to us, and we have also been encouraged by the peace camp of the whole world. Listen, this just roar resounding throughout the world:

    Eliminate the imperialist war of aggression!

    Eliminate imperialism itself!

    Long live the victory of the world peace camp!

    全世界都在响应
    郭沫若
    自从六月底，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争发动以来，我们保卫世界和平运动与反对美国侵略运动合而为一了。
    我们的运动不仅是用口舌笔墨作宣传，而且是用鲜血生命来行动。这就是我们的抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣斗争。
    我们的抗美援朝不仅是在保家卫国，而且是在保卫亚洲和平，保卫世界和平，保卫全人类的文化，保卫全人类的生命。
    我们的这一高度的爱国主义行动，同时也就是高度的国际主义行动，在华沙二届和平大会上是得到了全世界的响应了。
    华沙二届和大全部采纳了我们中国人民所提出的五项建议。二届和大各项决议的精神，一句话归总，便是“和平不能坐待，必须争取”。
    在今天要保卫世界和平就必须反对美国侵略。这在二届和大的各项决议里面也是表示得很明白的。
    因此我们可以这样说：在全世界范围内，保卫世界和平运动与反对美国侵略运动也合而为一了。
    是我们的抗美援朝的神圣运动鼓舞了二届和大，鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民，把世界和平运动提高了一步。
    因此，我们的抗美援朝，在今天，更可以说是在执行二届和大的决议了。
    我们的一个胜利接着一个胜利的正义斗争，严重地打击了妄想独霸全世界的美帝国主义，不仅保卫了亚洲的和平，同时也保卫了世界的和平。
    更加扩大和深入我们的运动吧，更加扩大和巩固我们的胜利吧！
    美帝国主义的侵略军队不撤退，就把它赶出朝鲜，赶出台湾！再不然就把它埋葬在朝鲜海峡里，埋葬在台湾海峡里！
    全世界都在响应我们，我们也得到了全世界和平阵营的鼓舞。请听，这轰遍全世界的正义的吼声：
    把帝国主义的侵略战争消灭！
    把帝国主义本身消灭！
    全世界和平阵营胜利万岁！
