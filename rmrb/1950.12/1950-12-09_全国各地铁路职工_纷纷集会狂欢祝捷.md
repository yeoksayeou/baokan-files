Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Railway workers across the country were overjoyed upon hearing the good news of the liberation of Pyongyang, the temporary capital of Korea, and held rallies to celebrate the victory.

    The Beijing West Railway Station was covered with celebratory slogans, and workers used their spare time to hold celebration meetings. Mi Dexing, a worker in the Transportation Office, said excitedly: "The liberation of Pyongyang is to let the American imperialists know the power of our people. From now on, we must work as two people in one, eliminate the American imperialists, and avenge the brothers Wang Endi who were innocently shot and killed by American soldiers at our station!" The loading and unloading workers of the entire station specifically proposed to strive to complete the annual task 20 days ahead of schedule. Beijing East Station warmly celebrated the liberation of Pyongyang. The Hao Shouhe group and the Ren Kangfu group, who happened to reach 10,000 hook-ups (referring to hooking up cars 10,000 times) without accidents today, loudly proposed a guarantee of a second 10,000 hook-ups without accidents. When the Beijing Railway Station Telegraph Office heard the good news, they immediately beat gongs and drums to spread the news everywhere and shortened the time for each telegram by 30%.
    The indomitable workers of the Andong Railway, under constant bombardment by American aircraft, were even more jubilant and excited upon hearing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang. Li Shuyou, a labor hero of the Andong Engineering Section, said: "Now that Pyongyang is liberated, we must ensure that train operations are not affected due to poor lines!" Fang Zhizhong, a labor hero of the Andong Station, said: "The liberation of Pyongyang shows the unparalleled strength of our people. We must implement this victory in our work and eliminate all accidents." Sui Zhendong, a special-class labor hero of Sankeshut, said: "Our average vehicle dwell time on December 1st was ten hours. After hearing about the Korean victory, we were so happy that we shortened the vehicle dwell time to an average of 6.4 hours." After hearing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang, the workers of the Changxindian Railway Factory could not help but hug each other and dance the Yangko. The passenger car factory challenged everyone and guaranteed that this month's task would be completed three days ahead of schedule, the quality would meet the standards, and the repair rate would be reduced by 5%.
    Upon hearing the news of the liberation of Pyongyang, the railway bureau workers in Tianjin and Fengtai immediately dispatched cultural troupes and propaganda teams to promote it in the streets.
    The Shanghai Railway Bureau workers held a rally that evening to celebrate the liberation of Pyongyang.
    The railway workers in Hengyang put letters celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang into condolence bags, braved the rain, and rushed to the trade union to entrust them to the brave Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were annihilating the enemy.

    天津、丰台两地铁路局职工听到平壤解放消息立刻出动文工团、宣传队上街宣传。
    上海路局职工于当晚召开平壤解放祝捷大会。
    衡阳铁路职工把庆贺平壤解放的信件，装进慰问袋，冒着雨，赶到工会，嘱托送给英勇歼敌的朝鲜人民军和我人民志愿部队。
