　　Xinhua News Agency, December 8th -- Comprehensive TASS news: The Romanian working people have enthusiastically voted to elect the People's Committees of various states, cities, districts, and villages. Voting began at 6:00 AM on the 3rd and was largely completed by 9:00 PM on the 4th. According to the Central Election Commission, 96.94 percent of the voters in the Bucharest state constituency voted, and 97.56 percent of the voters who voted elected the candidates of the People's Democratic Front; in Stalin City, the candidates of the People's Democratic Front received 98.01 percent of the votes. In cities such as Cluj and Iasi, and in ten other states, as of 11:00 PM on the 4th, 89 to 95 percent of the voters had voted. The candidates of the People's Democratic Front have received the vast majority of votes.

　　The Romanian Workers' Party organ, Scînteia, commented on the election results, stating that the Romanian people have voted to support peace, support socialist construction, and are determined to defend national sovereignty and independence from the aggression of American and British imperialists. They voted to support the consolidation of the friendly alliance with the Soviet Union to ensure Romania's happy future.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 8th -- Romania has victoriously completed the elections for local government organs at all levels—the People's Committees. This election was conducted on the basis of the increasing consolidation of the people's democratic system and the increasing development of the national economy. After liberation in 1944, the Romanian people, under the leadership of the Workers' Party (Communist Party), waged a resolute struggle, established a democratic government in March 1945, abolished the monarchy in December 1947, and established the People's Republic. During the same period, they successively completed major measures such as land reform, purging of fascists and traitors, and the democratization of the army. The new constitution adopted in April 1948 determined Romania's path towards socialism.

　　The Romanian working people have also achieved a series of victories in national economic construction. In 1948, Romania nationalized 90 percent of large industries. Two one-year economic plans were successively implemented last year and this year. This year's industrial production will exceed the pre-war level by 40 percent. 1,006 collective farms have been established nationwide, and their grain harvest is 33 percent higher than that of individual farmers. The number of employed people in Romania has increased year by year, and the real wages of workers have exceeded the pre-war level by 40 percent last year.

　　The Romanian people demonstrated their ardent support for the people's democratic system in the election. The newly elected People's Committees will further strengthen the ties between the people's regime and the broad masses of working people, and unite the people to victoriously realize the first five-year plan and the ten-year electrification plan, which will begin next year.

    【新华社八日讯】罗马尼亚已胜利完成了各级地方政权机关——人民委员会的选举。此次选举是在人民民主制度日益巩固与国民经济日益发展的基础上进行的。一九四四年解放后，罗马尼亚人民在工人党（共产党）的领导下，进行了坚决的斗争，在一九四五年三月建立了民主政府，在一九四七年十二月废除帝制，建立了人民共和国，并在同一期间相继完成了土地改革、肃清法西斯分子与叛贼和实行军队民主化等重大措施。一九四八年四月通过的新宪法，确定了罗马尼亚向社会主义前进的道路。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民在国民经济建设中也取得了一连串的胜利。一九四八年罗马尼亚把百分之九十的大工业收归国有，去年到今年相继执行了两个一年经济计划，今年的工业生产将超过战前水平百分之四十。全国已建立了一千零六个集体农场，其谷物收获量较个体农民多百分之三十三。罗马尼亚的就业人数连年均在增加，工人的实际工资在去年已超过战前水平百分之四十。
    罗马尼亚人民在选举中表现了热烈拥护人民民主制度的意志。新选出的人民委员会将进一步加强人民政权与广大劳动群众的联系，团结人民胜利实现明年开始执行的第一个五年计划和十年电气化计划。
