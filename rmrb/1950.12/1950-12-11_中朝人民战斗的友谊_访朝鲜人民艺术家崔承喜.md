    The Friendship of the Chinese and Korean People in Battle
    ——An Interview with Korean People's Artist Choi Seung-hee
    Bai Sheng

    When the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers liberated Pyongyang, the reporter met the famous Korean people's dancer Choi Seung-hee in Beijing.

    In a spacious and bright building, Choi Seung-hee was concentrating on teaching a group of young Chinese girls to dance. She stopped, shook hands with me, and said warmly, "Comrade, thank you, thank the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers for their assistance, which has enabled our country to achieve such great victories in the arduous anti-aggression struggle." Later, she repeatedly said with emotion, "When the Korean people were suffering from the enemy's cruel aggression, the Chinese people's great and warm support gave the Korean people the greatest encouragement. Every patriotic Korean will never forget this great friendship of the Chinese people in battle."

    Talking about her homeland being frantically destroyed by the American imperialists, Choi Seung-hee said with resentment, "Five years ago, the Soviet Red Army liberated North Korea and enthusiastically helped the Korean people build a peaceful homeland, leading the Korean people onto the road of happiness and enabling them to enjoy a good life. However, South Korea, ruled by the bloody American imperialists and the Lee Seung-man gang, has become a prison on earth, and the people of South Korea are living the darkest life. On the beautiful land of South Korea, it is filled with the blood, tears, and anger of the Korean people. Although the American imperialists are now frantically destroying the construction of North Korea over the past five years, in the hands of the patriotic Korean people, they have the confidence to build an even more magnificent Korea. The Korean people, liberated from decades of oppression by imperialism, know how to love their country. Today, the heroic Korean people, under the leadership of their People's Government and their wise leader Kim Il-sung, are carrying out a resolute struggle for the freedom and independence of their country."

    "Victory ultimately belongs to the peace-loving Korean people," Choi Seung-hee said firmly. "The Korean people's anti-aggression war has won the great support of the people of peace-loving and democratic countries all over the world, especially the great and just assistance of China and the Soviet Union. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, giving the enemy a series of major blows, defeating the enemy's general offensive, and victoriously liberating Pyongyang. We will achieve even greater victories on the road to victory."

    She said with full confidence, "The American imperialist aggressors have embarked on the path of Hitler and are bound to enter the grave."

    Speaking of this, Choi Seung-hee said excitedly, "Without a country, there would be no art. The people's government of the motherland warmly cherishes us and helps us to develop our artistic talents, enabling us to have the opportunity to establish artistic exchanges with the people of various democratic countries, and enabling us to serve the people of the motherland on the artistic front. We must use art to reflect the fighting life of the people of the motherland." In the war against the American imperialists' aggression against Korea, the more than one hundred staff members of the "Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Institute" led by this Korean people's artist immediately joined the entire Korean people in the struggle to defend the motherland. They were divided into seven teams and participated in performances on the front and rear battlefields with the People's Army. Choi Seung-hee's nineteen-year-old daughter, the talented young dancer Ahn Sung-hee, also led a team to the South Korean battlefield to work. For several months, the mother and daughter completely lost contact with each other until today when Pyongyang was victoriously liberated, Choi Seung-hee finally received the news that her daughter was safe. When talking about Ahn Sung-hee, Choi Seung-hee excitedly expressed her gratitude to the People's Army, because the People's Army, even in the midst of arduous battles, still took great care of the young artist. She said that Ahn Sung-hee has tempered herself in this combat life, which will be of great help to her future artistic achievements. She believes that in the near future, she will create new anti-American combat dances. But she also told me an unfortunate piece of news. On the Nakdong River front, when the battle was at its fiercest, her two young female students, Wu Chun-hee and Quan Shun-yuan, sixteen years old, who were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people for their performance of "Childlike Innocence," had gloriously sacrificed in the Andong campaign. They shed their last drop of blood for the motherland.

    She expressed deep gratitude for the great friendship of the Chinese people. Her visit to China this time is to complete an important combat mission in the form of art. In her own words: "It is to create some dances that reflect the great unity of the people of China and Korea; reflect the enthusiastic emotions of the Chinese people in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. To bring this art to the front and contribute it to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers." In the exchange of combat culture between the Chinese and Korean people, she is also willing to enthusiastically contribute her own strength to assist the Chinese people in developing the art of dance. Finally, this Korean People's Artist also firmly stated that she would strive to eliminate the aggression of the imperialists and strive for world peace. (Attached picture)

    中朝人民战斗的友谊
    ——访朝鲜人民艺术家崔承喜
    柏生
    当英雄的朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军解放平壤捷报传来的时候，记者在北京会见了著名的朝鲜人民舞蹈家崔承喜。
    在一间宽敞明朗的楼房里，崔承喜聚精会神地教导着一群中国年青的女孩子们学习舞蹈。她停下来和我握手，热情地说：“同志，感激你们，感激英勇的中国人民志愿军的援助，使我们祖国在艰苦的反侵略战斗中取得了如此巨大的胜利。”后来她又一再感动地说：“当朝鲜人民遭受着敌人残酷的侵略的时候，中国人民的这样伟大热烈的支援，给了朝鲜人民最大的鼓舞。每一个爱国的朝鲜人民将永不忘记中国人民这种伟大的战斗的友谊。”
    谈到被美帝疯狂破坏的祖国，崔承喜愤恨地说：“五年前苏联红军解放了北朝鲜，热诚帮助朝鲜人民建设和平的祖国，使朝鲜人民走上了幸福的道路，享受到美好的生活。但血腥的美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮所统治的南朝鲜，却变成了人间的牢狱，南朝鲜的人民过着最黑暗的生活。在美丽的南朝鲜的土地上，充满了朝鲜人民的血泪和愤怒。今天美帝虽然疯狂地破坏了北朝鲜五年来的建设，但在爱国的朝鲜人民手里，他们有信心再建设一个更雄壮的朝鲜。从帝国主义数十年压迫下解放出来的朝鲜人民，懂得怎样热爱他们的祖国。今天英勇的朝鲜人民正在自己的人民政府和英明的领袖金日成的领导下，为着祖国自由与独立而进行着坚决的斗争。”
    “胜利终究是属于爱好和平的朝鲜人民的。”崔承喜坚定地说。“朝鲜人民反侵略战争赢得了全世界爱好和平民主国家人民的伟大支援，特别是中国和苏联的伟大正义的援助。英勇的中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，给了敌人一连串的重大打击，击溃了敌人的总攻势，胜利的解放了平壤。我们将会在胜利的道路上取得更大的战果。”
    她充满着胜利的信心说：“美帝国主义侵略者已走上了希特勒的道路，是必然要进入坟墓的。”
    谈到这里，崔承喜激动地说：“没有祖国，就不会有艺术。祖国的人民政府热诚地爱护我们，帮助我们发挥艺术的天才，使我们能有机会与各民主国家人民建立艺术的交流，使我们能在艺术的战线上为祖国人民服务。我们要用艺术来反映祖国人民的战斗生活。”在反对美帝国主义者的侵略朝鲜的战争中，这位朝鲜人民艺术家所领导的“崔承喜舞踊研究所”的百余工作人员，立即和全朝鲜人民在一起，投入了保卫祖国的斗争。她们分成七队随着人民军参加了前线和后方战地的演出工作。崔承喜的十九岁的女儿，天才的小舞蹈家安圣姬，也领着一队出发到南朝鲜战地去工作。几个月中，她们母女完全失去了音讯联络，直到平壤胜利解放的今天，崔承喜才得到了她女儿平安的消息。谈到安圣姬时，崔承喜兴奋地表示了对人民军的感激，因为人民军虽在艰苦的战斗中，还是十分照顾那小艺术家的。她说，安圣姬这次在战斗的生活中锻炼了自己，这对她未来的艺术成就上，会有很大的帮助。相信在不久的日子中，她将会创作出抗美的战斗新舞蹈来。但是她却又告诉我一个不幸的消息。在洛东江前线，当战斗最激烈的时候，她的两个年青的女学生，以表演“童心”曾受到中国人民热烈欢迎的十六岁的吴春姬和全顺源已在安东战役中光荣地牺牲了。她们为祖国流了最后的一滴血。
    她对中国人民的伟大友谊表示着深深的感激。她这次访问中国，是要用艺术的形式完成一个重要的战斗任务。用她自己的话说：“就是要创作一些舞踊，反映中朝两国人民的伟大团结；反映中国人民在抗美援朝运动中的热烈情绪。把这种艺术带到前线去，贡献给英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军。”在中朝人民战斗文化的交流中，她并愿意热诚地贡献出自己的力量，协助中国人民发展舞蹈的艺术。最后，这位朝鲜人民艺术家还坚决地表示，要为消灭帝国主义者的侵略和争取全世界的和平而努力。（附图片）
