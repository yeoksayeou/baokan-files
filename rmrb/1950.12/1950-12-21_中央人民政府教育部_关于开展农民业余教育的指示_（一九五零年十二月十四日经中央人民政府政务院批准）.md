The planned and systematic development of spare-time education for peasants and the raising of their cultural level is one of the major tasks in our country's cultural construction at present.

For more than 20 years, various forms of spare-time education for peasants have been carried out in the old liberated areas, which have played a great role in raising the political consciousness of peasants and completing various tasks in the struggle against the enemy. However, due to the long-term war environment, the achievements in improving the cultural level of peasants are not very great. Now that the country has been unified, spare-time education for peasants should be strengthened to meet the needs of political, economic, and cultural development. Therefore, the following instructions are hereby made:

I. Spare-time education for peasants should generally focus on literacy and cultural learning, combined with current affairs, policy education, and production and health education. However, the conditions in various regions are different, and the level of awareness of peasants also varies; therefore, it is necessary to determine the educational content of various regions in stages, in accordance with the following principles, based on specific conditions and requirements:

	A. In the old areas where land reform has been carried out and the lives of peasants have been initially improved, a literacy campaign should be launched first to gradually reduce illiteracy, combined with current affairs, policy education, and production and health education. However, when there are major political tasks, the proportion of current affairs and policy education should be increased. In terms of target, we should first focus on village cadres, activists, and young men and women, and gradually extend to ordinary peasants. Strive to enable village cadres and young activists to learn more than 1,000 commonly used characters within three to five years, and have the ability to read, write, and calculate.
	B. In the semi-old and new areas where land reform has not been completed, due to the unfolding of the anti-feudal struggle in rural areas, it is generally necessary to focus on combining the central work and mass movements at the local time and place, and use various forms to carry out policy and current affairs education, in order to stimulate the class consciousness of peasants and improve their political understanding. If the peasants demand and conditions permit, literacy education can also be carried out appropriately to lay the foundation for carrying out the peasant literacy movement after the land reform is completed.
	C. In ethnic minority areas, in addition to adopting different policies according to the old and new areas, special attention should be paid to the education of ethnic policies, and other necessary education should be carried out in light of the characteristics and conditions of the local ethnic minorities. The cultural education of ethnic minorities should be based on the principle of using their own ethnic language, except for those who do not have their own ethnic script, but under the principle of voluntariness, other languages commonly used in local social life can also be used.

II. In the past, spare-time education for peasants mainly took the form of winter schools, which has been effective for many years and should continue to be developed in the future as a way to widely mobilize peasants to learn. However, in order to further make peasants' spare-time learning more regular, it is also necessary to strive to create conditions to gradually transform this seasonal spare-time learning into year-round spare-time learning. In places where conditions permit (such as some old areas), peasant spare-time schools should be established and adhered to as much as possible, supplemented by various decentralized forms of literacy classes or groups with dedicated leadership (such as field groups combined with production, and pit-head groups corresponding to life). The learning forms must be diverse and should not be forced to be uniform. Whether it is centralized or decentralized form, year-round learning or seasonal learning, it must be used flexibly and should be combined with the peasants' production mutual aid organizations and cultural and entertainment organizations as much as possible.

The year-round learning of peasants must not hinder production. Holidays should be given during busy farming seasons, and learning should be intensified during slack farming seasons. The learning of peasants must be based on the needs of peasants and the principle of conscious voluntariness, and oppose coercion and formalism, while preventing the phenomenon of laissez-faire.

III. Peasant spare-time cultural education, whether in centralized or decentralized form, can be divided into elementary classes (groups) and advanced classes (groups) according to the situation. Elementary classes (groups) enroll illiterate and semi-illiterate people, enabling them to recognize more than 1,000 commonly used characters within three years, and have the ability to read, write, and calculate. Advanced classes (groups) enroll those who have completed the elementary class courses or have equivalent academic ability, enabling them to basically reach the equivalent of senior elementary school graduation within two years. However, the number of classes and the time limit can be appropriately increased or decreased according to the specific conditions of each region.

The courses for elementary classes (groups) are tentatively set as literacy and arithmetic, with the principle of focusing on literacy in the first year and adding arithmetic in the second year. The courses for advanced classes (groups) are tentatively set as Chinese, arithmetic, and common sense. The curriculum standards for each subject will be formulated separately by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. The total study time for the year is tentatively set at 150 to 200 classes, each lasting one to two hours. Holidays may be given as appropriate during the busy farming season. The above regulations can be flexibly arranged or appropriately changed by various regions according to actual conditions.

Students who participate in elementary classes (groups) or advanced classes (groups), and who have completed the prescribed courses and passed the examination, may be issued graduation certificates for the elementary classes (groups) or advanced classes (groups) of peasant spare-time schools by the county and city people's governments. This certificate has the same effect as the graduation certificate of elementary or senior elementary schools in proving cultural level and applying for worker-peasant cadre cultural supplementary schools and worker-peasant quick-completion middle schools.

IV. Peasant spare-time education work should be led by the education departments of people's governments at all levels, and other relevant agencies and people's organizations should assist. When necessary, the county people's governments may, together with local peasant associations, New Democratic Youth League, democratic women's federations, and other relevant organizations, organize county peasant spare-time education committees to uniformly lead the peasant spare-time education work in the county.

V. To carry out spare-time education for peasants, except for peasant spare-time schools that have advanced classes and reach a certain number of people and can adhere to regular study, full-time teachers may be appointed as appropriate. Generally, the principle of "people teaching people" should be implemented, and all literate people should be called upon to be mass teachers, and to regard teaching people to read as their glorious task. Among the mass teachers, those with higher levels of education, education experience, and outstanding achievements should be selected as the backbone. When necessary, short-term training courses can be held to absorb unemployed and out-of-school intellectuals, provide them with political and ideological education, and supplement them with necessary vocational education. After graduation, they will be able to participate in peasant spare-time education work. Rural elementary school teachers should also be responsible for providing mass teachers with vocational guidance. The county people's governments should often take various measures to improve the political level and teaching ability of mass teachers, such as regular collective training, itinerant teaching, guidance on collective lesson preparation, holding teaching research conferences, teaching exhibitions, and organizing observation teaching and typical reports. In order to enable mass teachers to work with peace of mind and adhere to their work, the education departments of the major administrative regions, provinces, and cities should formulate measures for preferential treatment, living subsidies, or rewards for mass teachers based on the specific conditions in each region. Other agencies, organizations, and schools have the obligation to assist in carrying out local peasant spare-time education, and to help peasant spare-time schools solve housing and equipment problems under possible conditions.

VI. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Publications should be responsible for planning and guiding the publication of textbooks and reading materials for peasant spare-time education. The people's governments of major administrative regions may also compile and print textbooks on their own. Provinces, cities, and counties may compile supplementary textbooks based on local specific conditions, and should try to publish popular peasant reading materials and newspapers and periodicals as much as possible when possible.

VII. The funds for peasant spare-time education should mainly rely on local people to solve on their own. When necessary, a certain amount may be allocated from the county education funds to subsidize it. The people's governments of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities should allocate a certain amount of funds specifically for key subsidies and rewards for peasant spare-time education.

VIII. The education halls and bureaus of the people's governments of provinces and cities shall formulate implementation measures based on this instruction, and submit them to the higher-level people's government and the Ministry of Education for approval and promulgation.

    关于开展农民业余教育的指示
    （一九五零年十二月十四日经中央人民政府政务院批准）
    有计划有步骤地开展农民业余教育，提高农民的文化水平；是当前我国文化建设上的重大任务之一。
    二十余年来，在老解放区曾进行了多种形式的农民业余教育，对提高农民政治觉悟，完成各种对敌斗争任务，起过伟大的作用。但由于长期处于战争环境，在提高农民的文化水平方面，成绩还不很大。现在国家已经统一，农民业余教育亟应加强，以适应政治经济文化各方面发展的需要。为此特作下列的指示：
    一、农民业余教育一般地应以识字学文化为主，配合时事、政策教育和生产、卫生教育。但各地区的情况不同，农民觉悟程度亦有差异；因此又必须根据具体条件与要求，分别步骤，因时因地制宜，依照下列原则，规定各种不同地区的教育内容：
    甲、凡经过土地改革，农民生活已初步改善的老区，首先推行识字运动，逐渐减少文盲，并配合进行时事、政策教育与生产、卫生教育。但在遇有重大政治任务时，则应加重时事政策教育的比重。在对象方面，则应首先着重村干部、积极分子及青年男女，逐渐推广到一般农民。争取在三五年内使村干部及青年积极分子学会常用字一千字以上，具有初步读写算的能力。乙、凡未完成土地改革的半老区和新区，由于农村中反封建的斗争正在展开，一般地应以结合当地当时中心工作与群众运动，运用各种形式，进行政策、时事教育为主，以激发农民的阶级觉悟，提高其政治认识。如农民要求与条件许可，亦可适当地进行识字教育，为土地改革完成后开展农民识字运动打下基础。丙、少数民族地区，除按老区新区各采不同方针外，并应特别注意民族政策的教育，及针对当地少数民族特点与情况，进行其他必要的教育。少数民族的文化教育除尚无民族文字者外以用本民族文字为原则，但在自愿的原则下，亦可采用当地社会生活中普遍应用的别种文字。
    二、过去农民业余教育主要是采取冬学形式，多年以来已经行之有效，今后仍应继续发展，作为广泛动员农民学习的一种方式。但为了更进一步使农民业余学习趋向经常化，同时又必须争取条件，使这种季节性的业余学习，逐步转变为常年业余学习。在有条件的地方（如某些老区）应尽量举办和坚持农民业余学校，并辅以各种分散形式的和有专人领导的识字班或小组（如与生产相结合的地头小组，与生活相应的坑头小组等形式）。学习形式必须多种多样，不应强求一律。不论集中与分散的形式，常年学习与季节性学习，均须灵活运用，并应尽量与农民的生产互助组织与文娱组织互相结合。
    农民的常年学习必须不妨碍生产，农忙时应放假，农闲时应加紧学习。农民的学习必须根据农民需要与自觉自愿的原则，反对强迫命令与形式主义，同时防止放任自流的现象。
    三、农民业余文化教育，不论采取集中或分散的形式，均可按照情况分设初级班（组）与高级班（组）。初级班（组）吸收文盲与半文盲入学，使其在三年内认识常用字一千字以上，并具有初步读、写、算能力。高级班（组）吸收已经完成初级班课程或有同等学力者入学，使其在二年内基本上达到相当于高级小学毕业的程度。但此项班次和期限，各地可根据具体情况加以适当增减。
    初级班（组）的课程暂定为识字与算术两科，以第一年专学识字第二年增学算术为原则。高级班（组）的课程，暂定为国语、算术、常识三科。各科课程标准，由中央人民政府教育部另行订定之。全年学习时间暂定为上课一百五十次至二百次，每次一至二小时，在农作较忙时期，可酌情放假。以上规定可由各地根据实际情况与条件，灵活支配或作适当变动。
    参加初级班（组）或高级班（组）的学生，在学完规定课程并考试及格者，得由县市人民政府发给农民业余学校初级班（组）或高级班（组）之毕业证书。此种证书，在证明文化程度及投考工农干部文化补习学校和工农速成中学时，与初级小学或高级小学的毕业证书有同等效力。
    四、农民业余教育工作，应由各级人民政府教育部门领导，其他有关机关及人民团体予以协助。各县人民政府有必要时得会同当地之农民协会、新民主主义青年团、民主妇女联合会等有关团体组织县农民业余教育委员会，统一领导本县农民业余教育工作。
    五、开展农民业余教育，除设有高级班，并达到一定人数，能坚持正规学习的农民业余学校，可酌设专职教师外，一般地应实行以民教民的方针，号召动员一切识字的人作群众教师，以教人识字作为自己的光荣任务。群众教师中，应选择程度较高、教育有经验有成绩者为骨干。必要时并可举办短期训练班，吸收失业失学知识分子，施以政治思想教育，并辅以必要的业务教育，毕业后，使之参加农民业余教育工作。乡村小学校教职员，并应负责给群众教师以业务上的指导。各县人民政府，应经常采取各种办法，提高群众教师的政治水平与教学能力，如定期集训、巡回传授、辅导集体备课、举行教学研究会、教学展览会及组织观摩教学与典型报告等。为使群众教师能安心教学，坚持工作，各大行政区、省、市人民政府教育部门根据各地具体情况，制定对群众教师的优待、生活补助或奖励的办法。其他机关、团体、学校均有协助开展当地农民业余教育，以及在可能条件下帮助农民业余学校解决房屋设备的义务。
    六、中央人民政府教育部及出版总署，应负责计划及指导农民业余教育的教材与读物的出版。各大行政区人民政府亦得自行编印教材。各省、市、县，可根据地方具体情况，编辑补充教材，有可能时并应尽量出版通俗的农民读物与报刊。
    七、农民业余教育的经费，应以依靠当地群众自行解决为主。必要时得由县教育经费项下拨出一定数目，予以补助。各大行政区、省、市人民政府，应拨出一定数额的经费，专作农民业余教育重点补助与奖励之用。
    八、各省、市人民政府教育厅、局得依据本指示制定实施办法，呈请上级人民政府教育部批准后公布施行。
