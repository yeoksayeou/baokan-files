Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, 9th: People from all walks of life in Northern Korea are jubilantly celebrating the liberation of the temporary Korean capital, Pyongyang, and its vast surrounding areas. Mass rallies have been held in many towns and villages for days on end to celebrate the victory. The Korean people express their infinite gratitude to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army for assisting the Korean People's Army in achieving this glorious victory. Victory celebration rallies in various places have passed letters of thanks to Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people and the close friend of the Korean people. The following is a letter passed by a youth celebration rally in a certain area of Northern Korea:

Chairman Mao Zedong: We shout your name and cheer "Long Live!" to express our infinite gratitude and respect to you and the entire Chinese people under your leadership. The righteous assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has turned the tide of our liberation war, helped us to save our country from its national crisis, encouraged our fighting will, and further strengthened our belief in certain victory. This righteous act of the Chinese people not only sets a living example of internationalism for the Korean people and youth, but also is a brilliant example in the common struggle of oppressed peoples and youth around the world against imperialist aggression.

Chairman Mao Zedong, the great father of Chinese youth and the admired mentor of Korean youth: We thank the Chinese people for their brotherly support. We must unite closely with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and learn from them. For the independence and honor of our country, for the security of China and all of Asia, and for lasting world peace, we must fight bravely and resolutely. We will transform our lofty gratitude into the power to strive for final victory to repay the deep concern that the Chinese people have given us. We extend our highest gratitude and honor to you and wish you boundless longevity.
