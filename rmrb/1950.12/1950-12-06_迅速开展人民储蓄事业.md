To develop the people's savings undertaking is of utmost importance for guaranteeing the people's economic life and accelerating national economic construction. For twelve years, due to the exploitation and deception by the Japanese, Wang, American, and Chiang cliques, the Chinese people's savings capacity and savings habits have been devastated. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government has not only vigorously supported the victorious Liberation War but also stabilized the currency and stabilized the people's economic life, and the people's savings capacity has gradually begun to recover and grow. However, the people's economic life has not yet been further improved. It is really necessary to promote people's savings, save some less essential consumption, and save a little money every month. For the country, construction funds are currently extremely scarce. If the people of the whole country can each save 10,000 yuan, it can provide nearly 5 trillion yuan of funds, enough to establish several large-scale factories and tens of thousands of kilometers of railways, which will accelerate the progress of national construction and stabilize finance even more. Therefore, the savings undertaking is a powerful tool for guaranteeing people's lives, accelerating national economic construction, and further improving people's lives. In the savings undertaking, the people's current interests and long-term interests, the people's interests and the country's interests, are completely consistent. This is the basic reason why the savings undertaking in new democratic countries and socialist countries can be rapidly developed. The savings undertaking in capitalist countries is that workers save a little money and deposit it in banks for fear of unemployment, disaster, hunger, and starvation, so that a few capitalists can open factories and banks to further plunder the workers' blood and sweat. Therefore, the savings undertaking in capitalist countries is built on the basis of the suffering of the workers. The savings of new democratic countries are carried out by the people full of hope for improving their current and future lives.

Since entering Beijing and Tianjin, the People's Bank of China has realized the importance of the people's savings undertaking and started the people's savings undertaking under the difficult conditions of unstable currency. Due to long-term inflation, people were unwilling to conduct monetary savings. The People's Bank of China created the real value savings unit and held it first in large cities without considering profits or losses, in order to ensure the stability of workers' lives. At the same time, it also cooperated in combating silver dollar speculation, consolidating financial prices, and gradually restoring people's savings habits. In April of this year, prices fell, and the bank immediately launched principal-protected and value-guaranteed savings and monetary savings, dispelling people's ideological concerns about savings caused by falling prices.

Because the People's Bank wholeheartedly serves the people, as of July this year, the number of depositors has exceeded one million, concentrating a large amount of savings deposits. This proves that the people's savings undertaking can also be held during price fluctuations, and can be further developed during price stability (taking North China as an example, it has increased two-fold since February). However, the current development of savings cannot meet the needs of the people and construction. One million savings accounts are still too few, one thousand savings institutions are not widespread enough, the bank's savings procedures are not convenient enough, the working hours cannot fully facilitate workers, and the savings methods and systems still need to be improved.

The conditions for further development of people's savings are available. This year's bumper harvest in rural areas, active urban-rural exchanges, increased purchasing power of farmers, prosperity of industry and commerce, and more employment for workers have further improved people's lives, so the people's savings capacity has begun to grow. In Pingwang Town in southern Jiangsu and Huzhou in Zhejiang, many farmers deposited money in banks after selling silkworm cocoons, and many households have deposits of more than one million yuan. After selling cotton, farmers in central Hebei have high purchasing power. In addition to buying a lot of yarn, bicycles and other supplies, they also require principal-protected and value-guaranteed or real value savings. In the past, Chinese farmers did not have money to save because they were too poor, but now they are beginning to have the ability to save. Therefore, the savings coverage has also begun to gradually expand from large cities to small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas. Areas with marketable grain, cotton, tobacco, and ramie, and areas with special products such as tea, silk, and tung oil, especially have the possibility of carrying out a large amount of savings work. Another reason for the development of savings work is the stability of the RMB value and the expansion of the currency circulation area. When the currency value is unstable, it is difficult to expand the RMB circulation area. In areas without RMB, it is not easy to carry out savings work. At present, due to the stability of the currency value, the scope of RMB circulation has expanded, and many savings institutions have been established, and the necessary conditions for carrying out savings work have been met.

The People's Bank of China previously convened a national savings conference and made a decision to expand the savings undertaking, which was very timely. Regarding savings units, it was decided that principal-protected and value-guaranteed savings and monetary savings should be handled at the same time, and depositors can choose. For depositors, monetary savings are more convenient, but in order to dispel concerns about slight price adjustments, principal-protected and value-guaranteed savings are still very suitable for the times. Regarding savings methods, in addition to passbooks and registered deposit certificates, non-registered fixed-amount savings certificates are added, which simplifies procedures and is extremely convenient for workers. Salary slips can be issued when paying salaries, and then withdrawn from the bank when necessary. This kind of deposit certificate is especially beneficial for promotion in vast rural areas. This method solves the difficulty of insufficient bank institutions. Banks can entrust post offices, cooperatives, and other places to generally handle deposit certificates.

After careful research, the bank decided to start handling prize-winning savings certificates in large cities. Prize-winning savings and prize-winning government bonds have been effective in the Soviet Union and have become a popular method among the people. The significance lies in giving rewards in addition to principal and interest. Those who do not win the prize still have their principal and interest. The aviation lottery held by the Kuomintang reactionary government sacrificed principal and interest in exchange for bonuses, becoming speculative gambling, no different from horse tickets and flower associations; it is completely different from our prize-winning savings. The Northeast trial of prize-winning savings for three periods has achieved remarkable results. Recently, after being held in Tianjin, Shanghai and other places, the people warmly welcomed it, which is enough to show that it has a mass foundation and should be expanded.

The savings undertaking is a work of gathering small streams into rivers, and the bank should be very patient in carrying it out. Some cadres believe that savings are not easy, there are many troubles, and the results are not great; this concept must be corrected. Soviet experience proves that savings can become an important source of construction funds. Savings also have a significant effect on the balance of national cash revenue and expenditure; because savings are cash income, it is enough to absorb cash withdrawal, reduce social idle funds, and consolidate the stability of financial prices. Although the Soviet Union has entered the stage of socialist economic construction and the people's economic life is very prosperous, it still vigorously promotes savings, and the establishment of savings institutions is more common than that of state banks, which is enough to show the great significance of savings to the national economy. Bank cadres must attach great importance to savings work. Wherever there are national bank institutions, savings institutions must be established, and work efficiency must be effectively improved.

The savings undertaking is a mass undertaking, and it is not enough to rely solely on banks to carry out the work. Leaders of our party, government, and finance at all levels, leaders of factories, institutions, groups, and schools must pay close attention to assisting in promoting the work. Many institutions and groups have reduced the phenomenon of borrowing salaries, etc. by developing savings. Therefore, they should actively contact banks, assist in developing savings, and if necessary, they can discuss the establishment of savings offices and entrust banks to pay wages in order to facilitate the development of the savings undertaking.

The potential financial resources of our country are huge. We believe that after the savings movement is launched, it will continuously provide huge financial resources and become our monetary capital for accelerating economic construction, and facilitate us to further improve people's lives.

    迅速开展人民储蓄事业		胡景澐
    发展人民储蓄事业，对于保障人民经济生活，加速国家经济建设，有极其重大的意义。十二年来，由于日汪美蒋的剥削与欺骗，中国人民的储蓄能力和储蓄习惯已被摧残殆尽。中华人民共和国成立以来，中央人民政府不仅大力支持了胜利的解放战争，同时稳定了币值，安定了人民经济生活，人民的储蓄能力就逐步开始了恢复与成长。但人民经济生活还没有进一步的改善，提倡人民储蓄，节省一些不十分必要的消费，逐月储蓄一点钱，实在是必要的。对于国家来说，目前建设资金极其缺乏，如全国人民能各储蓄一万圆，就能提供近五万亿人民币的资金，足供创办若干规模宏大的工厂和上万公里的铁道，使国家建设的进度为之加速，金融更加稳定。因之储蓄事业是保障人民生活，加速国家经济建设，进一步改善人民生活的有力工具。在储蓄事业上，人民的目前利益与长远利益，人民的利益与国家的利益，是完全一致的。这是新民主主义国家和社会主义国家储蓄事业得以迅速开展的基本原因。资本主义国家的储蓄事业，是劳动者怕失业怕灾祸忍饥挨饿省下一点钱存入银行，供少数资本家开办工厂、银行，进一步掠夺劳动者的血汗；因此，资本主义国家的储蓄事业，是建立在劳动者痛苦的基础上的。新民主主义国家的储蓄，是人民满怀着改善自己目前和将来生活的希望而进行储蓄的。
    中国人民银行自从进入京津以后，就认识到了人民储蓄事业的重要性，并在通货不稳定的困难条件下，开办了人民储蓄事业。由于长期的通货膨胀，人民不愿进行货币储蓄，中国人民银行乃创造了折实储蓄单位，并不计盈亏在大城市首先举办，用以保障职工生活的安定，同时又配合打击了银元投机，巩固了金融物价，逐渐恢复了人民的储蓄习惯。今年四月，物价下降，银行又立即举办了保本保值储蓄和货币储蓄，解除了人民因物价下落而产生的对储蓄的思想顾虑。
    由于人民银行为人民忠诚服务，截至今年七月为止，储户已逾一百万，集中了大量的储蓄存款。这证明了人民储蓄事业在物价波动期间也能够举办，在物价稳定期间，当更能发展（以华北为例，二月以来增加两倍）。但是目前储蓄的发展，尚不能适应人民与建设的需要。一百万储蓄户还太少，一千个储蓄机构还不够普遍，银行办理储存手续还不便捷，工作时间尚不能完全便利职工，储蓄的办法和制度尚待改进。
    人民储蓄进一步开展的条件是具备了的。今年农村丰收，城乡交流活跃，农民购买力提高，工商业繁荣，职工就业者更多，人民生活已有进一步改善，因此，人民的储蓄能力已开始增长。苏南平望镇和浙江湖州，许多农民出售蚕茧后，便向银行储蓄，已有不少户存款一百万元以上。冀中农民出售棉花后，购买力很高，他们除了买回很多的纱布、自行车等用品外，同时要求办理保本保值或折实储蓄。中国农民过去因过于穷困没有钱储蓄，现在，则开始有了储蓄能力。因此储蓄面也开始从大城市逐渐推广至中小城市和广大农村。有商品粮、棉、烟叶、青麻出售的地区，有特产茶、丝、桐油出售的地区，尤其有大量开展储蓄工作的可能。储蓄工作得以开展的另一原因，是人民币值稳定，和货币流通区域的扩大。币值不稳的时候，人民币流通区域很难扩大，在没有人民币地区，就不易进行储蓄工作。目前由于币值稳定，人民币流通范围扩大，已建立了许多储蓄机构，储蓄工作开展的必要条件就已经具备。
    中国人民银行于前此召开全国储蓄会议，并作出了扩大办理储蓄事业的决定，是非常及时的。关于储蓄单位，决定保本保值与货币储蓄同时办理，可由储蓄户选择。对于储户来说，货币储蓄是更为方便的，但为解除物价稍有调整时的顾虑，保本保值还很适合时宜。关于储蓄方式，除存折和记名存单以外，增办不记名的定额储蓄存单，这便简化了手续，对职工极其方便，发薪的时候可以搭发存单，必要时再往银行取用。这种存单，尤其利于在广大农村推行。这一办法解决了银行机构不够普遍的困难，银行可以委托邮政局、合作社等普遍代办存单。
    银行经过审慎研究后，并决定自大城市开始办理有奖储蓄存单。有奖储蓄和有奖公债在苏联已行之有效，成为人民欢迎的方式。其意义在于保本付息之外，再予奖励，不中奖者，仍然本存息在。国民党反动政府所举办的航空奖券，舍本舍息以求奖金，成为投机赌博，无异于马票花会；与我们的有奖储蓄截然不同。有奖储蓄东北试办三期，成绩斐然。最近津沪等地举办后，人民热烈欢迎，均足以说明其有群众基础，应予扩大办理。
    储蓄事业是一个汇细流为江河的工作，银行方面应十分耐心进行。有些干部认为储蓄费力不小，麻烦不少，收效不大；这种观念必须纠正。苏联的经验证明，储蓄可成为建设资金的重要来源。储蓄对于国家现金收支平衡，亦有重大作用；因储蓄为现金收入，足以吸收现金回笼，减少社会游资，巩固金融物价的稳定。苏联虽已进入社会主义经济建设阶段，人民经济生活已很富裕，仍然大力推广储蓄，储蓄机构的设置较之国家银行更为普遍，即足以说明储蓄对于国民经济的重大意义。银行干部必须十分重视储蓄工作，凡有国家银行机构的地方，必须成立储蓄机构，并切实提高工作效率。
    储蓄事业是群众性的事业，如果单靠银行来进行工作是不够的。我各级党、政、财经负责人，工厂机关团体学校领导人，必须十分注意协助推进工作。许多机关团体因为展开储蓄，便减少了借薪等等的现象。因此应积极地与银行联系，协助开展储蓄，必要时可以洽商成立储蓄所，并委托银行代发工薪，以便利储蓄事业的开展。
    我们国家潜伏的财力是巨大的，我们相信储蓄运动开展以后，将源源不断地提供巨大财源，成为我们加速进行经济建设的货币资财，并便利我们进一步地改善人民生活。
