    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Tibetan Front, 1st: Tibetan compatriots in the Qamdo area and hundreds of miles around the Lancang River warmly welcome the People's Liberation Army. Local officials sent by the Lhasa authorities to this area are also returning to the embrace of the motherland's big family one after another.

    Many Tibetan herders sent representatives from mountain villages and pastures in various places to the PLA's stationed areas to express their warm welcome. More than 20 households of herdsmen from the Bala Cattle Farm in Gong County sent a representative, Silang Dengzhu, who travelled a long distance to the stationed area of a certain unit of the PLA, gesticulating and saying, "I heard that the PLA is here, and our herdsmen asked me to come and welcome them, and also to bring something back to prove that I really met the PLA." When he received the slogan of the PLA's Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention translated into Tibetan, he treasured it, wrapped it carefully in his arms, and happily returned. Some Tibetan compatriots even carried radishes and fruits from places two or three days away to comfort the PLA. Tibetan compatriots at a ferry crossing on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Jinsha River drove oxhide boats to help the PLA cross the river. Due to the PLA's strict discipline and the payment of sufficient wages, the number of oxhide boats for ferrying rapidly increased, enabling the rapid restoration and expansion of trade between Kangding, Ganzi, Dege and other places, and Qamdo.

    Silang Wangjie, the Zongben (county magistrate) of Ningjing County, who had once fled to the countryside due to being deceived by imperialist rumors, has voluntarily returned on November 2nd to continue his duties. All the private property and livestock owned by the Zongben have been returned in full by the PLA who had been temporarily managing it. Silang Wangjie said gratefully, "The PLA's generous policy makes me sincerely grateful. I will definitely work with peace of mind from now on." Living Buddhas from the two major lama temples in Chaya County and Xinzui Dajin, the Zongben of the county, as well as representatives of lama temples and Tusi from Gong County, Wucheng County and other places, totaling more than 20 people, rushed to a certain place to meet with the PLA leaders, expressing their welcome. They all praised the correctness of the Central People's Government's policies and the strict discipline of the PLA.

    昌都地区和澜沧江沿岸方圆地区
    藏胞热烈欢迎解放军
    拉萨派驻该区官员相率归向祖国
    【新华社康藏前线一日电】昌都地区和澜沧江沿岸方圆数百里地区的藏族同胞热烈欢迎解放军，拉萨当局派驻这一地区的地方官员也相率归向祖国的大家庭中来。
    很多藏胞牧民推派代表从各地山村牧场来到解放军的驻地表示热烈欢迎之意。贡县巴拉牛厂二十多户牧民派了代表肆朗邓珠远道赶到解放军某部的驻地，手舞足蹈地说：“听说解放军来了，我们牧民要我来欢迎，还要我带点东西回去证明我真正见了解放军。”当他接到了译成藏文的解放军三大纪律八项注意的标语后，就珍贵地包好放在怀里，欢欢喜喜地回去了。有的藏胞还从两三天的路程以外，驮来萝卜、水果慰问解放军。在金沙江上流西岸一个渡口上的藏胞驾着牛皮船帮助解放军摆渡，由于解放军的纪律严明和付给足够工资，使摆渡的牛皮船只迅速地增加着，使康定、甘孜、德格等地和昌都间的贸易来往迅速恢复和展开。
    因受帝国主义者的谣言所欺骗而一度躲避乡间的宁静县宗本（县长）思朗旺杰，已于十一月二日自动返回，继续供职。该宗本所有的私人财产牲畜已由代管的解放军全部发还。思朗旺杰感激地说：“解放军宽大为怀的政策使我衷心感谢，我今后一定安心工作。”察雅县两大喇嘛寺的活佛和该县宗本信最达靳以及贡县、武成县等地喇嘛寺和土司的代表二十多人先后赶往某地会见解放军首长，表示欢迎之意，他们一致盛赞中央人民政府的政策正确和解放军纪律的严明。
