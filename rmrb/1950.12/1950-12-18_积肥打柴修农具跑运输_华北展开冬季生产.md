    North China Launches Winter Production
    [Xinhua News Agency] A large-scale winter production movement in rural areas of North China is gradually unfolding. Farmers in various places are actively engaged in chopping firewood, accumulating fertilizer, and other sideline production.
    Before the start of the winter production movement, the people's governments of Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces successively issued instructions, calling on farmers to vigorously develop winter production. The Hebei Provincial People's Government also convened a winter production conference in late October, stipulating specific plans and implementation measures for this winter's fertilizer accumulation, winter water conservancy construction, sideline production, and other tasks.
    Subsequently, farmers in various places began to carry out tasks such as accumulating fertilizer, storing fuel, and repairing farm tools. For example, farmers in ten counties, including Huguan and Tunliu in Shanxi, swept up large quantities of fallen leaves and collected a large amount of rotten firewood to compress into fertilizer. Wuxiang, Pingshun, Xiangtan, and other counties have already accumulated more than 2 million dan of fertilizer. Farmers in Pingyuan Province are adding farm tools in large quantities. The Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office in the province has issued 1.6 billion yuan in farm tool loans to support iron and woodworking factories in mass production of farm tools. It has also organized 6,000 to 7,000 iron and woodworkers to travel to villages to repair and manufacture farm tools for farmers. Farmers in the mountainous areas of Chahar Province are going up the mountains to chop firewood and store fuel. Farmers in Shajiazhuang, Wanquan County alone, chopped more than 90,000 jin of firewood.
    At the same time, various types of sideline production have been launched in rural areas. Farmers in Chicheng and other counties in Chahar Province are engaged in more than ten types of sideline production, including transportation, weaving, and oil pressing. A total of more than 670 carts in Chicheng County are participating in transportation, and nearly 2,000 farmers have gone to the Chabei area to sell their labor, earning more than 890 shi of grain and accumulating funds for agricultural production. In Baoji County, Hebei Province, more than 8,000 farmers in 100 flood-stricken villages are engaged in sideline production such as weaving and fishing, with a total daily income of more than 50,000 jin of grain.
    In order to promote the sale of farmers' agricultural and sideline products and supply farmers with various means of production and living materials needed this winter, the people's governments and cooperatives in North China are vigorously promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The Linfen and Xinxian prefectural commissioner's offices in Shanxi Province have convened supply and marketing conferences. The Linfen Prefectural Commissioner's Office is currently leading farmers in repairing fifteen major roads, totaling more than 2,000 li in length, to facilitate the transportation of materials. The Lanxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative has transported local farmers' grain, wool, medicinal materials, and homespun cloth to Taiyuan and other areas for sale, and exchanged them for large quantities of table salt, cloth, and other necessities needed by farmers.

    积肥打柴修农具跑运输            
    华北展开冬季生产
    【新华社讯】华北区农村大规模的冬季生产运动正逐渐展开。各地农民正积极进行打柴、积肥及其他副业生产。
    在冬季生产运动开始前，山西、平原等省人民政府曾先后发布指示，号召农民大力开展冬季生产。河北省人民政府并于十月下旬召开冬季生产会议，规定了今年冬天积肥、冬修水利、副业生产等工作的具体计划和实施办法。
    接着，各地农民便纷纷进行积肥、储备燃料、修补农具等工作，如山西壶关、屯留等十县农民扫得大批落叶和拾得大批烂柴压制肥料，武乡、平顺、襄坦等县已积肥二百余万担。平原省农民正在大量添置农具。该省新乡专署曾发放十六亿元农具贷款，扶助铁、木工厂大量生产农具。并组织了六、七千个铁木工人到各村巡回替农民修制农具。察哈尔省山区农民纷纷上山砍柴，储备燃料。仅万全县沙家庄农民即打柴九万余斤。
    同时，各地农村并开展了多种多样的副业生产。察哈尔省赤城等县农民进行的副业生产共有运输、编织、榨油等十多种。赤城县共六百七十余辆大车参加运输，又有近二千农民到察北一带去卖工，现已赚得八百九十余石粮食，积累了农业生产的资金。河北省宝坻县一百个水灾村内有八千多农民进行编织、捕鱼等副业生产，每日共可收入粮食五万余斤。
    为了推销农民的农副业产品和供给农民今冬所需的各种生产资料和生活资料，华北各地人民政府和合作社现正大力推进城乡物资交流工作。山西省临汾、忻县等专署曾召开供销会议。临汾专署现正领导农民整修十五条长达二千余里的大路，以便利物资的运输。岚县供销合作社已将当地农民出产的粮食和羊毛、药材、土布等运往太原一带销售，并换回大批食盐、布匹等农民需用品。
