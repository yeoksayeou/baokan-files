Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th. According to TASS Moscow, "Pravda" published on the 28th a dispatch from Kornilov and Vasilyev from northern Korea stating: The officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, the working people in the rear, and the guerrillas who are striking the enemy with increasing force every day, warmly welcome the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean people's war of liberation. Korean newspapers publish almost daily dozens of letters from the Korean people expressing their deep gratitude to the Chinese people. The Korean people's will to fight for victory is now stronger than ever. All young people in Shuo County, Tieshan, Xuancheon, Aoyama, Biktong, and many other counties in Korea are volunteering to go to the front without exception. Workers, farmers, and intellectuals are actively assisting the front lines. Residents of many cities and villages in Korea are enthusiastically donating rice, money, winter clothing, and victory funds.
The news of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the Korean people's war of liberation has been broadcast by radio to the most remote corners of Korea. There, the heroic Korean guerrillas are fighting against the evil enemy. In the far-flung enemy rear, in Jeolla Province and Gyeongsang Province, new guerrilla units have been formed and named after Mao Zedong and Zhu De—the brilliant leaders of the Chinese people who have extended fraternal assistance to Korea. Korean guerrillas are now active in all occupied areas of the country, inflicting significant blows on the enemy. Hundreds, even thousands, of guerrillas are derailing trains loaded with American weapons, cutting off transportation, and giving the aggressors not a day of respite.
The reporters concluded: Because of their love for their motherland, the Korean people are preparing to give the enemy a decisive blow; they will reverse the situation in the sacred war of liberation, ensure the final defeat of the aggressors, and drive the aggressors out of Korean soil.

    我人民志愿部队赴朝  全朝鲜人民为之鼓舞
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”于二十八日登载科尔尼洛夫和瓦西里耶夫从朝鲜北部拍来的电讯称：朝鲜人民军的官兵、后方的劳动人民和一天天更沉重地打击敌人的游击队，都热烈欢迎中国人民志愿部队参加朝鲜人民的解放战争。朝鲜报纸上差不多每天都登有几十封朝鲜人民对中国人民表示深切感激的信。朝鲜人民争取胜利的意志，现在比以前任何时候都更加强烈了。朔州、铁山、宣川、青山、碧潼以及朝鲜许多其他县的所有青年，都无例外地自动走上前线。工人、农民和知识分子都给前线以积极的援助。朝鲜的许多城市和村落的居民都踊跃捐献米、钱、寒衣和胜利基金。
    中国人民志愿部队参加朝鲜人民解放战争的消息，被无线电带到了朝鲜的最遥远的角落。在那里，英勇的朝鲜游击队正在对万恶的敌人作战。在遥远的敌后，在全罗南道和庆尚北道，新的游击队已经组成，并以毛泽东和朱德——已向朝鲜伸出兄弟般的援手的中国人民的光辉的领袖——的名字来命名。朝鲜游击队现在正在国内所有被占领区活动，给敌人以重大的打击。成百的、甚至成千的游击队，把装载美国武器的火车弄出了轨，截断了交通，不给侵略者一天喘息的机会。
    记者在结语中写道：由于对自己的祖国的热爱，朝鲜人民正在准备给敌人决定性的打击；他们将扭转神圣的解放战争中的局势，保证最后击败侵略者，把侵略者赶出朝鲜的土地。
