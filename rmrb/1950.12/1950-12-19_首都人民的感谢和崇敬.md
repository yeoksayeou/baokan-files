    The courtyard and corridors of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression are piled high with wooden boxes and packages of various sizes, with the names and quantities of the items marked on them. In a large room facing north, a dozen comrades in green military uniforms from the Public Security Forces are busily packing the items one by one into boxes or wrapping them into packages. The whole room is filled with various items. Of particular note are the two large piles of letters of appreciation and comfort bags. These have been collected from every corner of Beijing, from all walks of life, and they express the gratitude and respect of two million citizens for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and the Korean People's Army.

    I. Let the Voice of Justice Resound Throughout the World

    With excitement and emotion, I finished looking at the mountain of goods and letters, and also reviewed the lists sent by various units, and deeply felt that the turned-over Chinese people's love for the motherland and for our Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea is truly meticulous; for the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, they have shown a close, brotherly friendship. The variety of comfort goods is so great that even the most complete department store could not match it. Here are the daily necessities that a person needs: soap, towels, toothbrushes, tooth powder, toothpaste, gloves, cotton clothing, flannel clothing, woolen sweaters, masks, shirts, raincoats, handkerchiefs, leather hats, scarves, cigarettes, matches, skin cream, bath soap, diaries, pencils, pens, books, wallets, goggles, flashlights... There are also many valuable items, such as automatic watches, diving watches, binoculars, cameras, Parker pens, diamond rings, various leather goods, wool coats, blankets, and even several very old and valuable decks of cards.

    This comfort campaign in Beijing, like those in other places, was entirely spontaneous. The branch only issued one notice in the newspaper, mainly to inform the various units of the methods for collecting comfort goods and letters of appreciation. However, the patriotic enthusiasm of the people from all walks of life was very high, and many moving deeds emerged. Many people, in order to express their determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, even donated their most beloved possessions. A man named Wang Zuomin donated a Parker pen and a mechanical pencil. Bai Qizhang of the Electrical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University donated a six-tube battery-powered receiver that he had personally repaired, with the inscription: "Dedicated to the communications team of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army." Fearing that the comrades of the army might damage the receiver and find it difficult to obtain parts at the front, he also specially attached six electronic tubes and four vacuum tubes.

    These comfort goods, whether ordinary or valuable, whether worth a lot of money or little money, all contain deep, sincere feelings, and express a common belief: that is, the Chinese people's firm determination to resist American aggression. On each comfort bag, the donors inscribed words such as "Heroically Kill the Enemy," "Advance Bravely," "Fight for Freedom," and "People's Heroes" to encourage the soldiers of the Chinese and Korean people. Some even used various colors of thread to personally embroider exquisite flowers and cartoons. Diao Yechun of the State Council's Foreign Affairs Bureau embroidered a person squatting on the ground with silk thread on the comfort bag, holding a bone in his mouth, with the inscription: "Austin's nature is hard to change." It is particularly meaningful that some people personally specified the use of the items they donated. Zhang Yan wrote on the camera he donated: "Please capture the atrocities of the American imperialists into the lens and make them public to the world." Xin Fanglin, a student at the Beijing Advanced Industrial Vocational School, put a harmonica he donated to the Korean People's Army in a cloth bag, on which was written: "Let the voice of justice resound throughout the world." There are many such examples. Every Chinese person who has suffered from the bullying and humiliation of imperialism has expressed his enthusiasm and wishes through various different items.

    II. Drive the American Aggressors Out of Korea

    The 110,000 letters of appreciation filled six large wooden boxes. As the comrades of the Public Security Forces were nailing the wooden boxes, I looked through dozens of letters. Each letter was filled with enthusiastic, kind, and caring words. Whether workers, peasants, students, industrialists, businessmen, or staff members of various organizations, they all unanimously greeted and encouraged the soldiers of the Chinese and Korean people who were heroically fighting the enemy in the frozen land. In the letters of young workers, students, and children, I found many terms of address as close as family members. Older people called the soldiers of the Chinese and Korean people "dear brothers," and younger children called them "dear uncles." This is a concrete manifestation of the lofty emotions of mankind and the great spirit of internationalism.

    A student in the second grade of junior high school at Municipal No. 4 Middle School, after congratulating and comforting the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in affectionate words, wrote the following sentence at the end of the letter: "I wish you to make more corpses of the American aggressors." Obviously, this young student of New China, after watching the movie "The Fall of Berlin," was deeply moved by the great spirit of the Soviet people in defending their motherland, so he dedicated this bloody and tearful line of poetry to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Another student, Xing Shiyuan, from Municipal No. 3 Middle School, wrote in his letter of appreciation to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: "Your bravery is deeply imprinted in everyone's heart, and your spirit has moved the hearts of thousands of people who love peace... For nearly a hundred years, the Chinese people have suffered the cruel rule and plunder of imperialism and feudalism, and only through the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong have they been freed from suffering and oppression. But American imperialism is not reconciled and is trying to invade us by force, attempting to obstruct our peaceful construction. Historical facts have long told them: whoever starts a war will surely perish, and victory belongs to the people who love peace." Deng Shihua, a worker at the Water Company, wrote in a letter of appreciation: "American imperialism is nothing to be afraid of, it's just a paper tiger. Look! Since you crossed the river, you have driven back the American imperialists by hundreds of miles; just add a little more effort and you will drive them all out of Korea. I work in the assault team of the Water Company, and in order to support you in fighting well, I will definitely put in 120 percent of my strength to do a good job in production."

    Yang Shiyu, a student in the second grade of junior high school at Municipal No. 4 Middle School, vividly expressed the Chinese people's determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea in a letter to the Korean People's Army. He said: "Today you are rising up to resist American aggression, this is a just action. We Chinese people completely agree with your action and will do our best to support you. Now there are thousands of young people in our country who have joined the Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Forward! Soldiers of the Korean People's Army, we are waiting for even greater news of victory."

    Du Zhonghou, a Chinese friend and comrade who signed himself as loyal to the Korean people's cause of liberation, also used a few short and powerful sentences to explain the reason why the American aggressors are bound to fail. He wrote: "Although the American imperialists have occupied many of your cities and villages, the people there do not belong to them. The hearts of the Korean people will forever return to the motherland, to the People's Army, and to General Kim Il-sung!"

    III. Dedicated to the First Soldier to Enter Daegu

    The Chinese people, who have stood up from the enslavement of imperialism and feudalism, have a strong belief in the victory of the just cause of the Korean people's liberation. A person named Yu Song had already written a manuscript in August, with a Parker "May 1st" type pen attached. In the manuscript, he analyzed in detail the reasons why the American aggressors are bound to fail and the Korean people are bound to win, and called on all Chinese people who love peace to take practical actions to support the just cause of the Korean people. He said: "The first thing we should do is to do our best to donate goods and contribute them to the officers and soldiers of the heroic Korean People's Army, Navy, and Air Force. In order to express my respect for the Korean people's soldiers, I am willing to dedicate a pen of mine that has been with me for a year, never leaving my side for a moment, to the first people's soldier to enter Daegu." This incident shows that even when the American aggressors were frantically rampant, the Chinese people had already seen the inevitable victory of the Korean people's war of liberation. Today, the victorious development of the Korean war situation has completely realized the wishes of millions of Chinese people who love peace like Yu Song. (Attached picture)

    首都人民的感谢和崇敬
    本报记者  林洪   
    在中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会北京分会的院子里和走廊上，堆积着计多大大小小的木箱和包裹，上面注明了物品的名称和数量。靠北面的一间宽大的屋子里，十几个穿着绿色军服的公安总队的同志，正忙碌地把一件一件的物品装进箱里，或者打成包裹。满屋子都散放着各种各样的物品。特别引人注目的，是两大堆慰问信和慰劳袋。这是从北京市各个角落，从各阶层人民中汇集起来的，它表现了二百万市民对中国人民志愿援朝部队和朝鲜人民军的感谢和崇敬。
    一  让正义的歌声响遍全世界
    我带着激动和兴奋的心情，看完了这堆积如山的物品和信件，又翻看了各单位送来的清单，深深地感觉到，翻了身的中国人民对于祖国，对于我志愿援朝部队的热爱，真是无微不至；对于朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，则表现了亲切的兄弟般的友情。慰劳品种类之多，恐怕连一个最完备的百货商店也赶不上。这里有一个人日常生活所必需的肥皂、毛巾、牙刷、牙粉、牙膏、手套、棉衣裤、绒衣裤、毛线衣、口罩、衬衣裤、雨衣、手绢、皮帽、围巾、香烟、火柴、润面油、香皂、日记本、铅笔、钢笔、书籍、皮夹、风镜、手电筒……还有许多贵重的东西，如自动手表、游泳表、望远镜、照像机、派克钢笔、钻石戒指、各种皮货、毛呢大衣、毯子，以及几副非常古老、名贵的扑克牌等。
    这次北京人民的慰劳运动和其他地方一样，完全是自发的，分会只在报上发过一次通知，主要是告诉各单位慰劳品和慰问信的收集办法。但是各阶层人民爱国的热情十分高涨，出现了不少令人感动的事迹。许多人为了表示抗美援朝保家卫国的决心，甚至献出了自己最心爱的东西。有一个叫王作民的捐献了一支派克钢笔和一支自动铅笔。清华大学电机系的白其章，献出了自己亲手修复的六管电池式收讯机一部，上面写着：献给英勇的中国人民志愿部队通讯队。他恐怕部队的同志们用坏了收讯机，在前方不易配到零件，还特别附上六个电子管式和四个真空管式的灯泡。
    这一些慰劳品，不论是一般的，或是贵重的；值钱多的，或是值钱少的。但是它里面都含着深厚的真挚的感情，表现了一个共同的信念，那就是中国人民反抗美国侵略的坚强的决心。在每一个慰劳袋上，捐献的人都题上了“英勇杀敌”、“奋勇前进”、“为自由而战”和“人民功臣”等鼓励中朝人民战士的词句。有的还用各种颜色的线，亲自绣上了精致的花朵和漫画。政务院交际处的刁业纯，用花丝线在慰劳袋上绣着一个人蹲在地下，嘴里含着一根骨头，旁边写着：奥斯汀本性难移。特别令人感到含意深长的是，有人在自己捐献的物品上，亲自注明它的用途。张演在自己捐献的照像机上写着：请把美帝的暴行摄入镜头，公诸全世界。北京高级工业职业学校学生信芳麟，把献给朝鲜人民军的一个口琴，用布袋装起来，上面写着：让正义的歌声响遍全世界。像这样的例子是很多的。每一个饱受帝国主义欺凌和侮辱的中国人，就这样通过各种不同的物品；表达了自己的热情和愿望。
    二  把美国侵略者赶出朝鲜去
    十一万封慰问信，装满了六个大木箱。当公安总队的同志们正在装钉木箱的时候，我翻看了几十封信。每一封信里都充满了热情、亲切和关怀的词句，不论工人、农民、学生、工商业者和各机关的工作人员，都一致问候和鼓励正在冰天雪地中英勇杀敌的中朝人民的战士们。我在青年工人、学生和小朋友的信里，发现了许多亲如家人的称呼，年纪稍大的叫中朝人民的战士“亲爱的哥哥”，年纪还幼小的叫“亲爱的叔叔”。这是人类崇高的感情和伟大国际主义精神的具体表现。
    市立第四中学初二的一个学生，用亲切的语句祝贺和慰问中国人民志愿部队的同志们以后，在信的末尾写着这样一句话：祝你们多制造美国侵略者的尸首。很显然的，这一位新中国的青年学生看过“攻克柏林”电影后，深为苏联人民保卫祖国的伟大精神所感动，因此他才把这一句有血有泪的诗句，献给了英勇的中国人民志愿部队。另一个市立第三中学学生邢士元，在给中国人民志愿部队的慰问信里这样写着：你们的勇敢深刻地印在每一个人的心中，你们的精神感动了成千成万爱好和平人民的心……近百年来，中国人民受着帝国主义和封建主义的残酷统治和掠夺，靠着毛泽东主席的英明领导，才摆脱了苦难和压迫。但是美帝国主义并不甘心，又企图以武力侵略我们，妄图阻挠我们的和平建设。历史的事实早已告诉他们：谁发动战争，谁必灭亡，胜利是属于爱好和平的人民的。自来水公司工人邓世华在慰问信上写着：美帝没有什么可怕，只不过是一只纸老虎而已。看！自从你们一过江去，就把美帝打退了好几百里；只要再加一把劲，就会把它全部赶出朝鲜去。我在自来水公司的突击组工作，为了支援你们打好仗，我一定拿出一百二十分的力量来搞好生产。
    市立第四中学初二学生杨世煜，在给朝鲜人民军的信中，非常生动地表达了中国人民抗美援朝的决心。他说：今天你们奋起抵抗美国的侵略，这是正义的行动。我们中国人民完全同意你们的这一行动，决尽全力支援你们。现在我国已有千万个青年参加了志愿援朝部队。前进吧！朝鲜人民军的战士们，我们正在等待着更大的胜利的消息。
    一个署名忠于朝鲜人民解放事业的中国朋友和同志的杜忠厚，也用几句简短有力的语句，说明了美国侵略者必然失败的道理。他这样写着：美帝虽然强占了你们许多的城市和乡村，然而那里的人民并不属于他们。朝鲜人民的心永远归向祖国，归向人民军，归向金日成将军！
    三  献给第一个进入大丘的战士
    从帝国主义和封建主义的奴役下站立起来的中国人民，对于正义的朝鲜人民解放事业抱着坚强的胜利信心。有一个署名叫喻松的，早在八月间就写好了一篇文稿，上面夹着一支派克“五一”型的钢笔。他在文稿里详尽地分析了美国侵略者必败和朝鲜人民必胜的原因后，号召全中国爱好和平的人民，拿出实际行动支援朝鲜人民的正义事业。他说：我们首先应做的是尽力捐助物品，贡献给英勇的朝鲜人民军的陆海空军将士们。我为了表示对朝鲜人民战士的崇敬，愿将伴身一年片刻未离的钢笔一支，献给第一个进入大丘的人民战士。这一件事说明，就在美国侵略者疯狂猖獗的时候，中国人民已经看到了朝鲜人民解放战争必然胜利的前景，今天朝鲜战局的胜利发展，已完全实现了像喻松这样千千万万爱好和平的中国人民的愿望。（附图片）
