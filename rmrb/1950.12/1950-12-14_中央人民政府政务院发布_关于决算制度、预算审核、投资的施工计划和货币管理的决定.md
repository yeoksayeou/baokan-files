Xinhua News Agency, December 13th—The Central People's Government Administration Council's Decisions Regarding the Final Account System, Budget Review, Investment Construction Plans, and Currency Management.

(Passed at the 61st Administrative Meeting of the Government Administration Council on December 1, 1950)

I. Implement the final account system. Since the later stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the expenses of military and government organs, schools, and organizations in the liberated areas were partly self-sufficient through the labor and production of military and government personnel. Therefore, the system of submitting quarterly and annual final account reports to the financial departments has long been suspended in some cases, and not consistently implemented in others. The current situation has changed, and the expenses of military and government organs, public schools, and organizations are now fully or largely provided by the state. Therefore, in accordance with Article 40 of the Common Program, it is specifically decided that all military units, governments, public schools, and organizations receiving state funding must submit final account reports to the central or local people's government financial departments on a quarterly basis, and submit an annual final account report for the previous year by March 31st each year. The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government will then submit the previous year's general final account to the Central People's Government for review and approval. State-owned enterprises must also submit final account reports regularly. To achieve this requirement, it is necessary to strengthen the financial work and financial personnel of each unit. After the final account, all remaining funds in the budget must be returned to the national treasury. Implementing the final account system is a state law and must not be disobeyed; it must not be delayed unless approved by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government. To avoid the phenomenon of waste of surplus funds in the budget after the implementation of the final account system, the responsible personnel of military and government organs, schools, and organizations at all levels are responsible for preventing it.

II. Implement budget review. When troops, organs, schools, and organizations submit their budget for expenses or state-owned enterprises submit their investment budget to the financial departments within the scope of the total budget approved by the Central People's Government, the budget must first be carefully reviewed by the head of the fund-receiving organ before it can be submitted. The corresponding people's government financial departments have the responsibility to further review and recalculate this budget. Personnel in the financial departments at all levels who review the budget must be loyal to the state system and strictly abide by financial discipline; the budget-submitting organs must not refuse the review. If there is a dispute between the financial department and the budget-submitting organ during the review that cannot be resolved, it shall be reported to the higher-level financial department together with the superior organ of the fund-receiving department for review and final decision.

III. Strengthen the planning of investment. In the past, there has been some waste in the economic construction investment in the liberated areas due to a lack of experience. Relying solely on enthusiasm and wishes, lacking practical design and necessary construction plans before starting construction, individual projects either changed midway or were rebuilt, causing considerable losses to the state's financial resources. This phenomenon must be avoided as much as possible. Therefore, it is decided that all enterprise investments or cultural undertakings investments approved by the Central People's Government or local people's governments must be carefully designed, a construction plan, construction drawings and financial disbursement plan must be created before applying for funds, and must be approved by the corresponding level of people's government or its economic and financial, cultural and educational organs. The financial department shall refuse to allocate funds if there is no design, no construction plan, construction drawings and financial disbursement plan, or if they have been prepared but not approved. This regulation is necessary not only to strive for rationality in the timing of the state's cash use, but more importantly to reduce waste in the state's economic and cultural construction.

IV. Implement further currency management. Since the implementation of currency management in March this year, good results have been achieved due to the consistent compliance of troops, organs, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives. Based on existing experience and work foundation, in order to further rationally use cash, the People's Bank of China is responsible for formulating further currency management methods. To facilitate the currency management of the troops, the People's Bank of China should gradually establish military banks accompanying the troops. The use of cash by troops, organs, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives must be planned for revenue and expenditure and approved by the appropriate authorities. All transactions between troops, organs, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives within the local area, between different ports, and internationally shall be settled through the People's Bank of China. No arrears or loans shall occur between the above-mentioned units, and credit shall be concentrated in state banks. The allocation of funds for capital construction investment of each enterprise shall be gradually supervised by the bank and allocated according to plan, so that the state bank becomes the general accounting agency for the accounts of troops, organs, state-owned enterprises, organizations, and cooperatives.

The above provisions are to avoid waste and strive for the rational use of state financial resources. This is the state's financial discipline and must be enforced. All relevant financial and economic departments are responsible for formulating various implementation measures based on the above principles.

### 中央人民政府政务院发布  关于决算制度、预算审核、投资的施工计划和货币管理的决定

    中央人民政府政务院发布
    关于决算制度、预算审核、投资的施工计划和货币管理的决定
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府政务院关于决算制度、预算审核、投资的施工计划和货币管理的决定
    （一九五零年十二月一日政务院第六十一次政务会议通过）
    一、实行决算制度。自抗战后期以来，由于解放区的军政机关、学校、团体的经费，其中一部分是依靠军政人员的劳动生产自给的，故按季、按年向财政部门作决算报告的制度，有的久已停顿，有的执行得不经常。目前情况已经改变，军政机关、公立学校、团体的经费，全部或绝大部分已由国家发给，因此，依照共同纲领第四十条的规定，特决定所有军队、政府、公立学校及受国家经费补助的团体，均须每年分四季向中央或各级人民政府的财政部门作决算报告，每年三月三十一日作上年度的全年决算报告，再由中央人民政府财政部将上年度总决算案报请中央人民政府核批。国营企业亦须定期作出决算报告。为着实现这一要求，加强各单位的财务工作和财务人员是必要的。决算之后，凡在预算中所余的款项，均须缴回国库。实行决算制度是国家的法令，不得违抗；除中央人民政府财政部批准者外，不得延迟。为了避免实行决算制度后，可能发生浪费预算中的余款的现象，责成各级军政机关、学校、团体的负责人员，切实负责防止。
    二、实行预算审核。各部队、机关、学校、团体在中央人民政府批准的总预算范围以内，向财政部门提出经费的预算或国营企业的投资预算时，该项预算案，必须首先经过各该领款机关的首长切实亲自审核后，才能提出。各相当的人民政府财政部门对此预算有再加审查与核算的责任。各级财政部门审核预算的人员，必须忠实于国家制度和严守财政纪律；各该提出预算机关不得拒绝审核。审核时，财政部门与提出预算机关如有争执而不得解决者，报由上级财政部门会同领款部门的上级机关复核审定之。
    三、加强投资的计划性。过去解放区在经济建设的投资方面，由于缺乏经验，有过一些浪费。只凭热情和愿望，在动工以前，缺乏切实的设计和必要的施工计划，因此个别兴工了的工程，或则中途改变，或则重建，使国家财力蒙受了不少损失。这种现象，必须尽力避免。因此决定：中央人民政府或地方人民政府批准的一切企业投资或文化事业的投资，在请领款项以前，必须审慎设计，作出施工计划施工图案和财务支拨计划，并须经过各该级人民政府或其财经、文教机关的批准。未经设计，未作施工计划施工图案和财务支拨计划或已作而未经批准者，财政部门应拒绝拨款。此项规定之所以必要，不仅为了使国家在现金运用的迟早上，力求合理，更主要的是为了减少国家在经济文化建设中的浪费。
    四、实行进一步的货币管理。自今年三月实行货币管理以来，由于各部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社的一致遵行，取得了良好的效果。根据已有的经验及工作基础，为了进一步合理使用现金，责成中国人民银行规定进一步的货币管理办法。为了便利部队的货币管理，中国人民银行应逐步举办部队的随军银行。部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社的现金使用，必须编造收支计划，并经适当机关的批准。各部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社间在本埠、埠际及国际间的一切交易往来，全部通过中国人民银行划拨清算。上述各单位间，不得发生赊欠和借贷，信贷集中于国家银行。各企业基本建设投资之拨款，逐步交由银行实行监督，按计划拨款。使国家银行成为部队、机关、国营企业、团体、合作社的总的账务会计机关。
    上述各项规定，是为了避免浪费，力求国家财力的合理使用。这是国家的财政纪律，必须执行。兹责成各有关财经部门，根据上述原则，制定各项实施办法。
