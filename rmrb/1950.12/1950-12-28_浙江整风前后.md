Party Life

    Before and After the Rectification in Zhejiang
    By Our Correspondent Lin Wei
    What problems did the rectification solve, and what practical effects did it have? From the perspective of Zhejiang, the more important aspect is that the scientific leadership method of "combining leadership with the masses, and combining the general with the specific" has begun to be widely applied.
    This improvement started from the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committees. After the rectification, in the land reform experiments, the consolidation of rural organizations, and the autumn grain requisitioning and production quota setting, the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committees (some with work teams) went separately to several counties to create base points and summarize typical experiences. They helped the rural cadres in the base points to understand and publicize the various policies, and to implement the policies in light of the specific circumstances and the demands of the masses. Taking care of and uniting the small landlords (there are many such people in rural Zhejiang), the middle peasants, and the widowed, orphaned, and childless; specifically distinguishing various figures and treating them separately; correcting the erroneous thoughts and practices of cadres and activists... Various specific experiences were quickly disseminated to the wider areas through base point work conferences and the issuance of documents. According to inspections in the land reform areas of Hangzhou County and Jiaxing County, the general cadres can now handle affairs according to policies, the situation of coercion and commandism has begun to change, the united front in rural areas is very broad, and only a very small number of illegal landlords have been punished. The results of the punishment were supported by the broad masses. The general landlords also expressed their willingness to abide by the laws and transform themselves through labor. In the consolidation of land, although there was no emphasis on the struggle against hidden land as in the previous year, tens of thousands of mu of hidden land were exposed due to the mobilization of the enthusiasm of the masses, which was far more than what was "opposed" last year. This increased the government's fiscal revenue, and the people's burden was fairer and more reasonable than last year. According to calculations, this year, by following the agricultural tax rate, it is fully confident to complete or even exceed the task. In the autumn grain requisitioning and production quota setting work, the county committees generally felt that the leadership from above this year was specific, and the work was more effective than before. Therefore, the process was relatively smooth, and there were few instances of conflicts between the masses and the cadres. Grain delivery was also very fast, and many villages completed it in a day or two.
    According to the Liuxia District Committee of Hangzhou County, since the rectification, the county committee has been closely monitoring the inspection and supervision after the work deployment. The county committee often pays attention to asking about any difficulties and helps to solve them in a timely manner. The phenomenon of poor communication between the upper and lower levels has been basically overcome. The county committee itself also frequently visits key townships, and any good practices or detours can be quickly communicated to the district. The district committee is now also beginning to learn the methods of the county committee in leading the townships. When setting production quotas, the county committee discovered that the Pingyao District had not been fully prepared and asked the masses to approve the standards set by the county, which resulted in failure. The county committee, through summarizing production achievements (including actual harvest volume), commending model workers, and mobilizing model workers and rural cadres and activists to insist on fair opinions in the quota setting in key townships, persuaded the general masses, and as a result, correct standard output was successfully passed. The above two practices were promptly notified, and good practices were promoted.
    From the history of Zhejiang's work, the significance of this progress is significant. In the early days of Zhejiang's liberation last summer, a rent reduction and anti-despotism campaign was launched, which mobilized the masses to a considerable extent. However, there were also many deviations: indiscriminately refunding deposits, refunding pre-rentals, liquidating old accounts of more than ten years, and infringing on some small landlords and middle peasants. The reason was mainly that the leading organs lacked a concrete understanding of the situation in Zhejiang and did not provide specific guidance through typical experiences. Cadres blindly copied the experience of refunding deposits and combating corruption in the old areas. Due to similar reasons, lower-level cadres more commonly used coercion and commandism in last year's autumn grain requisitioning, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Since this spring, through the initial criticism of bureaucracy and commandism, and through water management, pest control, rice transplanting, land reclamation, disaster relief, and various agricultural loans, the prestige of the Party and the government has been enhanced among the people. But on the other hand, many cadres still use old methods, causing many bad consequences. In water management, some did not distinguish between priorities, lacked inspection and assistance, and spent a lot of grain but gained little. Some forcibly stipulated time limits without asking whether the time was very tight, not allowing the masses any flexibility, causing some farmers to miss the waterwheel and dry out the rice. Pest control is a matter of life and death for the broad masses, but many cadres also used coercive methods to carry it out, arousing resentment.
    Obviously, the lack of good examples for cadres to learn from and the inability to find good practices have become a serious obstacle to the implementation of all policies and tasks. If this problem is not solved, even if the decisions and instructions from above are completely correct, they still cannot achieve complete results. In this year's autumn grain requisitioning and land reform, problems similar to last year's autumn grain requisitioning and rent reduction may still occur.
    During the rectification, Party organizations at all levels led Party members and cadres to study Comrade Shaoqi's report on the Party's mass line, the Party Central Committee's decision on leadership methods, and Stalin's On Leadership and Inspection. Using these documents as weapons, they examined and criticized bureaucracy and commandism, and specifically studied the scientific leadership methods and work styles of "combining leadership with the masses" and "combining the general with the specific." At the same time, Party organizations at all levels examined the problems in policy thinking. New leadership methods have now been initially established. However, this cannot be regarded as a complete solution. Many grass-roots cadres are still reciting policies verbally and cannot turn policies into the action slogans of the masses. When they cannot convince the masses, they pull out articles and read them to the masses (such as the issue of not touching the rich peasants). After reading, the masses still do not agree, and they are at a loss; or they simply say: "This is the law, it's no use not agreeing." When doing typical experiments, many people do not do well, do not create much experience, or have experience but do not see it and cannot sum it up.
    Another issue is the combination of departmental work and central work. Many cadres in departmental work often like to emphasize the work of their own departments; the Party committees often have the tendency to only engage in the center and relax departmental work. When several cadres from the Communist Youth League and the Trade Union in Zhenhai County went to Linjiang Township to lead the masses in repairing the pond for flood prevention, they developed members of the Communist Youth League and organized the Educational Workers' Union. These League members and union members played a great role in mobilizing the masses to repair the pond. The experience of combining departmental work with central work like this should be seriously studied and promoted in the future.

    浙江整风前后
    本报记者  林韦
    整风究竟解决了那些问题，起了那些实际的作用呢？从浙江的情形看，比较重要的，是“领导与群众结合，一般与个别结合”这一科学的领导方法，开始被普遍应用。
    这种改进，是从省委、地委开始的。在整风以后的土改实验、整理乡村组织与秋征订产中，省委和地委们（有的带着工作队）都分头到若干县份去创造基点，总结典型经验。他们帮助基点上的乡村干部了解与宣传各项政策，结合具体情况特点和群众要求来贯彻执行政策。对小土地出租者（浙江农村中这种人很多），中农和鳏寡孤独的照顾与团结，具体区别各种人物，分别对待，纠正干部积极分子中错误的思想与做法，………各种具体经验，经过基点工作会议和印发文件，迅速传播到广大地区。根据杭县与嘉兴县土改地区检查，土改中一般干部现在都能按政策办事，强迫命令情形已开始改变，农村中统一战线很广泛，受到处分的只是极少数的不法地主。处分的结果，得到广大群众拥护。一般地主也表示愿意遵守法令，在劳动中改造自己。整理土地中，虽然没有像去年一样强调反黑地斗争，但由于发动了群众的积极性，揭发的黑地有好几十万亩，比去年“反”出来的多得多。增加了政府的财政收入，人民的负担也比去年公平合理多了。据计算，今年照农业税率办事，完全有把握完成甚至超过任务。秋征订产工作中，县委一般都觉得上级今年领导具体，工作中较前有办法。所以进行比较顺利，很少发生群众和干部对立的现象，交粮也很快，许多乡村一两天就交齐了。
    据杭县留下区区委谈，整风以来，县委在工作布置之后，检查督促抓得很紧。什么困难，县委都经常注意询问，及时帮助解决。上下不通气的现象基本克服了。县委自己也经常跑重点乡，创造了什么好的做法，走了什么弯路，都能很快通报到区。区委对乡的领导，现在也在开始学习县委的办法。订产量时，县委发现瓶窑区未经充分准备，便拿县里所订标准到群众中要求通过，结果失败。县委在重点乡经过总结生产成绩（包括实际收获量）、评选劳动模范、动员劳动模范和乡村干部积极分子在订产中坚持公正意见，说服一般群众，结果顺利通过正确的标准产量。以上两种做法及时通报，好的做法便推广了。
    从浙江工作的历史看，这个进展的意义是重大的。去夏浙江解放之初，曾经发动过减租反霸运动，相当地发动了群众。但是也发生了不少偏向：无分别地退押金，退预租，清算十几年老账，侵犯了一些小土地出租者与中农。其原因，主要是领导机关对浙江情况缺乏具体了解，没有通过典型经验进行具体指导。干部盲目地搬用老区退押金、反贪污的经验。由于类似原因，下层干部在去年秋征中更普遍发生强迫命令现象，引起群众很大不满。今春以来，经过对官僚主义与强迫命令作风的初步批判，经过治水、除虫、插秧、开荒，救灾与各种农贷，提高了党与政府在人民群众中的威信。但另一方面，也仍有许多干部使用旧的方法，造成许多恶果。治水中，有的是不分轻重缓急，缺乏检查帮助，费了许多粮食而收获很小。有的是不问时间是否十分紧迫，强制规定时间，一天也不让群众机动，使有些农民误了车水，旱干了稻子。除虫是广大群众生死攸关的事情，但也有不少干部用强迫办法去进行，激起反感。
    显然，干部在工作中缺少好的例子作榜样，找不到好的做法，成了贯彻一切政策与任务的严重障碍。这一问题如不解决，即使上面的决定指示都完全正确，仍然不能得到完满的效果。在今年秋征与土改中，仍然有可能发生与去年秋征、减租中类似的问题。
    整风中，各级党都领导党员干部学习了少奇同志关于党的群众路线问题的报告，党中央关于领导方法的决定，斯大林论领导与检查。以这些文件作武器，检查批判官僚主义与命令主义的作风，具体研究了“领导与群众结合”、“一般与个别结合”的科学领导方法与工作作风。各级党同时检查了政策思想上的问题。新的领导方法，现在是初步树立起来了。但是，这还不能看做彻底的解决。有许多基层干部还是在口头上背诵政策，不能把政策变成群众的行动口号。说不服群众时，便搬出条文给群众念（如不动富农问题）。念了群众还是不赞成，自己便束手无策；或者简单地说：“这是法令，不赞成也没办法。”做典型试验时，也有许多人做得不好，创造不出多少经验，或是有经验而看不见，总结不起来。
    另外一个问题，是部门工作与中心工作的结合问题。许多部门工作的干部，常常喜欢强调自己部门的工作；党委则多存在有光搞中心，放松部门工作的偏向。镇海县几个青年团与工会的干部到临江乡去领导群众修塘防水时，发展了青年团员，组织了教育工作者工会，这些团员会员都在动员群众修塘中起了很大作用。像这样部门工作与中心工作结合的经验，今后应认真研究推广。
