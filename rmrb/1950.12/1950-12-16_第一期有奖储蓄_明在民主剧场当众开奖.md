    京市人民银行举办的保本保值有奖定期储蓄，第一期共发行两组计二十万张，已于本月十三日全部收储满额，定于明（十七）日下午一时在民主剧场提前开奖。该行为了慎重做好开奖工作，特请中央人民政府财政部、市人民政府、市财委会、市人民法院、和市人民监察委员会等机关派员到场监督，并邀市总工会、工商联合会、学联、妇联、银钱业公会和代理收储的邮局及私营行庄到场参观，一般市民也可入场参观。开奖结果当天晚间由市人民广播电台广播，并于次日在报纸发表。
    第二期的有奖储蓄，定本月二十一日开始收储，现已有各机关团体职工二千多人向该行预约登记。该行为适应市民储蓄能力，并决定自第二期起缩短存储期限，由六个月改为三个月。
