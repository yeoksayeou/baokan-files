At the send-off rallies, students participating in military cadre schools received warm encouragement from teachers, parents, and classmates. Students from Renmin University and Yanjing University also participated in the Tsinghua University send-off rally. When Tsinghua teacher Li Jixiang spoke, he said: "Our entire faculty and staff of the Department of Mechanical Engineering resolutely respond to the call of the National 'Science Association' and 'Popular Science' to use practical actions in our positions to cooperate with the needs of national defense construction and the production front. We are prepared to accept and actively strive for all possible work that the motherland entrusts to us to support the students participating in the military cadre schools." At the North China Middle School send-off rally, Yuan Donglin's parent, Pu Xixiu, said: "It is the correct path for young people to participate in military cadre schools. Today, my daughter can fulfill the wishes I could not, and I feel boundless excitement and glory." Zhang Binru's parent, Zhang Kun, encouraged Zhang Binru to be brave and strong after participating in the military cadre school and not to be emotional.

The students from various schools participating in the military cadre schools unanimously expressed their determination to defend their homes and the country at the send-off rallies. The fifty students from Tsinghua University participating in the military cadre school swore an oath at the send-off rally: "We guarantee to resolutely obey the organization, learn military science and technology well, overcome any difficulties, stick to our posts, not be afraid of sacrifice, carry forward the glorious tradition of Chinese youth, inherit the Chinese People's Liberation Army's fine style of hard work, bravery, and loyalty to the people, and under the leadership of the Party, grow and develop in struggle, and forever move from victory to victory!"
