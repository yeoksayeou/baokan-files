    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government Issues Instructions
    Carry Out Winter Agricultural Production
    Prepare for Next Year's Spring Plowing, and Engage in Sideline Production to Create Favorable Conditions for Next Year's Production Movement.
    [Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued instructions on carrying out winter agricultural production work. The instructions first pointed out that winter production is not only a continued expansion of this year's production results, but also an important step in determining next year's production. Leaders at all levels must prevent complacency caused by the bumper harvest, and should ideologically and organizationally mobilize the masses to enthusiastically engage in winter production. The instructions continued: To carry out winter production, this year's production should first be summarized from the bottom up through appraisal campaigns, exhibitions, symposiums, labor model conferences, people's representative conferences, and farmer representative conferences, to affirm achievements and gain experience and lessons. Such a summary is the best mobilization for carrying out winter production, and also the best preparation for determining next year's production plans and carrying out the production movement. The summary materials will serve as one of the teaching materials for winter training of county, district, and village cadres and for winter literacy classes for the masses. The instructions emphasized that in preparing for next year's production, "things that can be done well in winter must not be postponed until next year," so that spring plowing can be carried out proactively and victoriously next spring. Regarding sideline production, the instructions said that various localities should organize the masses to carry out sideline production in accordance with local conditions, and must rely on cooperatives and state-owned trade agencies, especially in conjunction with cooperatives, and carry it out in a planned manner according to market needs, to prevent blind production. The instructions finally required all major administrative regions to make specific plans, deploy them in a timely manner, and strengthen organizational inspection work to ensure that winter production achieves good results.

    中央人民政府农业部发出指示
    开展冬季农业生产
    做好明年春耕准备，进行副业生产，为明年生产运动创造有利条件。
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部发出关于开展冬季农业生产工作的指示。指示首先指出：冬季生产不仅是本年生产成果的继续扩大，且是决定明年生产的重要步骤。各级领导方面必须防止因丰收引起的自满情绪，应从思想上组织上动员群众热烈投入冬季生产。指示继称：开展冬季生产，首先应将今年的生产通过评比运动，展览会，座谈会，劳动模范会，人民代表会，农民代表会等形式，自下而上地加以总结，肯定成绩，取得经验教训；这样的总结就是开展冬季生产的最好动员，也是确定明年生产计划和开展生产运动的最好准备。总结的材料，即作为冬季训练县、区、村干部及群众冬学中的教材之一。指示着重指出，准备明年生产的工作，凡能“在冬季做好的事，一定不让推到明年”，以便明春能主动地胜利地进行春耕。关于副业生产，指示说，各地应因地制宜地组织群众开展副业生产，必须依靠合作社和国营贸易机关，特别要与合作社结合，并根据市场需要，有计划地进行，防止盲目生产。指示最后要求各大行政区应做出具体计划，及时布置，加强组织检查工作，使冬季生产获得良好成绩。
