    Promoting a High Degree of Patriotism
    People Across the Country Enthusiastically Deliver Public Grain to Warehouses
    People of All Ethnic Minorities
    Actively Hand Over Public Grain
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] The autumn grain collection in the Northwest, Southwest provinces, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and other ethnic minority areas is nearing completion in some areas, while in others, farmers are enthusiastically delivering grain.
    Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have fully demonstrated their love for the motherland and the People's Government in the grain delivery process. In various counties of the Dihua Special District, farmers enthusiastically delivered grain as soon as the collection began, sending grain in groups. Now, Dihua, Gande, and other counties have almost completed their tasks. The three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan in northern Xinjiang, as well as various districts in southern Xinjiang, also began collection successively in October and November. With the enthusiastic participation of farmers, all counties are very confident in completing the autumn grain collection task. An old farmer named Miretihan from the first village of the first district of Kuerle County in southern Xinjiang did not listen to the deception of the landlords and truthfully reported his land to the government. He said: "This year, the People's Government has built water conservancy projects, adjusted seeds and draught cattle, and done many things for the people. The burden is also reasonable. It would be too ungrateful to the People's Government if I didn't report truthfully."
    Hui and Tibetan farmers in Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and other provinces are very active in paying agricultural taxes. Farmers in Linxia, where the Hui people of Gansu province live, are now delivering grain to warehouses. Su Wankui, an Ahong from Danjiaji, Jingning County, Gansu Province, was very indignant after hearing the news of American imperialism's aggression against our country, and immediately paid 140 catties of public grain to express his determination to defend the country. Hui and Han farmers in Jinji, Zhongning, and other counties in Ningxia also launched a challenge competition for delivering grain to warehouses.
    The autumn grain collection in the Southwest provinces, where the Fan, Tibetan, Miao, Yi, and other ethnic groups live, is also progressing smoothly, and many areas are nearing completion. Many Fan people and Tu officials in Songpan County, western Sichuan, have paid their due public grain on schedule. The 60 shih of public grain paid by the Fan people of Dashe Village in the county was transported to the district government after traveling for ten days across mountainous roads. They sent good grain. They said: Now that we are paying grain to our own People's Government, we should pay good grain.
    Various leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia began collection successively in November. Farmers and herdsmen in various counties and banners of the Jerim League, Zhaowuda League, and Chahar League had long prepared for grain delivery. Therefore, a wave of delivering grain to warehouses was set off soon after the collection began. Tongliao County in the Jerim League completed half of its public grain task in ten days in the middle of last month. Now, the autumn grain collection in many counties and banners has been completed. In order to express their determination to defend the country, farmers mostly requested early collection. Duolun County in the Chahar League started five days earlier.
    Most of the Public Grain in Central South has been Stored
    Hunan and Jiangxi have Completed all their Tasks
    [Our Newspaper] Under the wave of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country, the broad masses of farmers in the Central South region have promoted the spirit of patriotism and enthusiastically handed over public grain. As of late November, the region had completed about 70 percent of its autumn grain collection. Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have completed all their tasks. The amount of public grain stored in Hubei Province has reached more than 87 percent of the total task. Thirty-two counties in the three special districts of Yichang, Xiangyang, and Huanggang have all completed their tasks. The remaining unfinished parts can be handed over in the first ten days of this month. Since the start of grain delivery in the suburbs of Wuhan, according to incomplete statistics from the Wutai and Hongshan districts, the amount of public grain stored has reached 250,000 catties. Henan Province has completed more than 30 percent of the total task. The public grain in Xuchang Special District, Luoyang County, Luoyang City, and Xinzheng County has all been stored. The province's public grain task is expected to be fully completed by the middle of this month. Guangxi Province has reached about 20 percent of the total task. Guilin Special District has completed 90.4 percent of the total task. The autumn grain collection work in Guangdong Province and the suburbs of Guangzhou started relatively late and is now being stepped up. Some areas have fully completed the storage task. The enthusiasm of farmers for grain delivery is unprecedentedly high. Farmers in the first district of Mengjin County, Henan Province, encouraged by the patriotic enthusiasm of resisting America and aiding Korea, launched a mass upsurge of milling rice and delivering grain. For example, the mother of farmer Wang Jingchen in Matun Township, who is over fifty years old, milled rice for two consecutive nights to strive to hand in the grain first. She said: "The grain we are handing in is to defend our homes and country, so we must mill the rice finely and winnow it clean." In Huaqiao Village, Xing'an County, Guangxi Province, under the slogan "Hand in public grain to strengthen national construction, prepare to meet and eliminate American aggressors," the village's task of 100,030 catties of public grain was all stored in less than a day. In areas where the task has been completed, the broad masses of farmers are throwing themselves into the land reform movement under the slogan "After handing in the grain for liberation, quickly make a thorough liberation and divide the land well."
    In the current work, there are still shortcomings that need to be improved urgently. The main ones are that some areas have not grasped the leadership of the autumn grain collection work tightly enough, relaxed further mobilizing the masses, and deeply urged and inspected, resulting in the public grain task not being completed in time. For example, the leading organs of some counties and districts in Henan believe that the autumn grain collection task is not too big and there is no need to worry. The Zhujiang Special District of Guangdong Province proposed "Better to be slow than chaotic, collect grain after rent reduction." Another bias is that the leading organs and finance and grain departments in some areas do not pay enough attention to the storage of public grain, nor do they resolutely implement the principle of achieving appropriate concentration of grain from a high degree of dispersion. In addition, the internal system of the warehouse is not strict, the management is not strict, and since the autumn grain collection, some areas have experienced arson by bandits and secret agents, theft of public grain, grain mildew, and corruption by staff. The above phenomena should be corrected immediately in various places. (Central South Ministry of Finance Communications Group)

    发扬高度爱国主义精神  
    各地人民热烈缴纳公粮入库
    各少数民族人民  
    踊跃缴纳公粮
    【新华社十三日讯】西北、西南各省和内蒙古自治区等各少数民族地区的秋征，有的已近完成，有的地区农民正在热烈地缴纳。
    新疆各族农民在缴粮中充分表现了对祖国、对人民政府的热爱。迪化专区各县一开始征粮农民就踊跃缴纳，结队送粮。现在迪化、干德等县都差不多完成了。北疆伊犁、塔城、阿山三区和南疆各区，也已在十月、十一月先后开征。在农民热烈缴纳下，各县对于完成秋征任务都很有信心。南疆库尔勒县第一区第一乡农民米热提汗老汉不听地主的欺骗，向政府如实地报了自己的土地。他说：“人民政府今年兴修水利，调剂种籽、耕牛，给人民办了很多事，负担又合理，不实报就太对不起人民政府了。”
    甘肃、青海、宁夏等省回族、藏族农民缴纳农业税都很积极。甘肃回族聚居的临夏农民现在正在送粮入仓。该省静宁县单家集阿訇苏万魁，听到美帝国主义侵略我国的消息后非常愤慨，立即就缴纳了一百四十斤公粮来表示保家卫国的决心。宁夏金积、中宁等县回汉农民，并掀起了送粮入仓的挑战竞赛。
    西南各省番、藏、苗、彝等族聚居区的秋征也很顺利，许多地区已接近完成。川西区松潘县的许多番民、土官都已如期交清了应缴的公粮。该县大设寨番民所缴的六十石公粮，是翻山越岭跋涉了十天山路送到区政府的。他们送的都是好粮食。他们说：现在给我们人民自己的政府缴粮，应该缴好粮。
    内蒙各盟旗在十一月都已先后开征，哲里木盟、昭乌达盟、察哈尔盟的各县、旗，农民和牧民早有送粮准备，因此在开征不久就掀起了送粮入仓的热潮。哲里木盟通辽县在上月中旬十天中就完成了公粮的一半，现在许多县、旗的秋征都已完成了。农民为表示保家卫国的决心，多要求提早开征。察盟多伦县就提早了五天。
    中南公粮大部入库  
    湖南江西已全部完成任务
    【本报讯】在抗美援朝保家卫国的浪潮下，中南区广大农民发扬爱国主义精神，踊跃缴纳公粮。截至十一月下旬止，全区秋征公粮已完成百分之七十左右。湖南、江西两省已全部完成。湖北省入库公粮，已达总任务的百分之八十七强。宜昌、襄阳、黄岗三专区共三十二县，已全部完成任务。其他尚未完成部分，可于本月上旬交清。武汉市郊区，自开始缴粮以来，根据武泰、洪山两区不完全的统计，入库公粮已达二十五万斤。河南省已完成总任务的百分之三十以上。许昌专区及洛阳县、洛阳市、新郑县，公粮已全部入库。该省公粮任务预计本月中旬可全部完成。广西省已达总任务的百分之二十左右。桂林专区已完成总任务的百分之九十点四。广东省及广州市市郊区，秋征工作开始较晚，现正加紧征收中。部分地区并已全部完成入库任务。农民的缴粮热情更是空前高涨。河南省孟津县一区农民，在抗美援朝的爱国热情鼓舞下，开展了群众性的碾米缴粮高潮。如马屯乡农民王敬臣五十多岁的母亲，连着碾了两夜米，争取先缴。她说：“咱们缴的是保家卫国粮，一定要把米碾细簸干净。”广西省兴安县花桥村，在“缴纳公粮加强国家建设，准备迎击和消灭美国侵略者”的口号下，全村十万零三千余斤公粮任务，不到一天即全部入库。湖南省南县五区三保农民，都用风车把谷子扇过三遍。现已完成任务的地区，广大农民正在“缴完翻身粮，赶快闹翻身，好好把田分”的口号下，投入土改运动。
    当前工作中，仍存在亟待改进的缺点。主要的是，有些地区对秋征工作的领导抓得还不够紧，放松了更进一步地发动群众，深入督促检查，致使公粮任务不能及时全部完成。如河南有的县、区领导机关，认为秋征任务不太大，用不着着急。广东省珠江专区提出“宁慢勿乱，减完租后再征粮”。另一种偏向是某些地区领导机关及财政和粮食部门，对公粮保管工作重视不够，也没有坚决执行将粮食由高度的分散，达到适当的集中。加之仓库内部制度不严密，管理不严格，秋征以来，有些地区发生匪特纵火，盗劫公粮，和粮食霉烂与工作人员贪污事件。上述现象，各地应立即纠正。（中南财政部通讯组）
