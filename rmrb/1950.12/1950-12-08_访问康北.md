Visiting Northern Kham

The Jueri Temple beside Karsang Tsochi

The car heading to Garzê, passing through the grasslands near Luhuo, through high mountains, canyons, and large pine forests, arrives at Zhuwo, more than sixty kilometers from Garzê.

Zhuwo, at an altitude of over three thousand meters, is covered with freshly fallen snow on the mountain peaks, and the reflection of the Jueri Lama Temple is quietly reflected in the Karsang Tso Lake (pool).

In 1935, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army marched north to resist Japan, they passed through Zhuwo. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and General Liu Bocheng stayed in Jueri Temple for a few days.

The Tibetan people of Zhuwo and the late Living Buddha Zhangshijiao Qiong of Jueri Temple gave a lot of help to the Red Army who had traveled a long distance. When the Red Army was approaching Zhuwo, the Tibetan people of Zhuwo, misled by the rumors of the Kuomintang reactionaries, fled one after another; however, the Red Army's practical actions in respecting the customs and habits of the Tibetan people and protecting the Lama Temple in Zhuwo deeply moved the Living Buddha and Lamas in the temple. They called back the nearby people and lent a large amount of grain and cooking utensils to the Red Army in distress. When the Red Army transferred from Zhuwo to Garzê and Yushu, Jueri Temple also sent many tents and Tibetan boots, and local Tibetan people such as Renqing and Yake also led the way for the Red Army.

When the special vehicle of the Central Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group arrived in Zhuwo, the Lamas of Jueri Temple gathered on both sides of the road to welcome the representatives sent by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Head of the delegation Liu Geping expressed his special thanks for the help given by the Tibetan people of Zhuwo and Jueri Temple to the Red Army. Gesang Zhiling, the steward of Jueri Temple, recounted the scene when the Red Army passed through the area, and enumerated the persecution suffered by the people of Zhuwo by the Kuomintang reactionaries. After the Red Army left, the Kuomintang reactionary troops arrived in Zhuwo, snatched the pennants and gifts given by the Red Army to Jueri Temple, and abducted the Red Army soldiers who were hiding in Zhuwo due to injuries and illnesses and could not transfer with the main force of the Red Army. After years of suffering, the people of Zhuwo became even poorer, and the number of able-bodied men and women was greatly reduced.

The Tibetan people of Zhuwo never forget Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and General Liu Bocheng. When all the Lamas in the temple saw Head of the Central Visiting Group Liu presenting Chairman Mao's Commemorative Badges to the Living Buddha and the steward of the temple, they were extremely moved.

The Lamas led the comrades of the visiting group to view the places where Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and General Liu Bocheng had stayed. Fifteen years after the Red Army left Zhuwo, and after the people of Zhuwo had endured long-term suffering, they once again saw the banners of the people's army, and also saw the representatives sent by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. The People's Liberation Army they see today is completely different from the Red Army they saw fifteen years ago. The situation of the Chinese revolution has undergone earth-shaking changes, the Kuomintang reactionary regime has been declared dead, the Chinese people's armed forces have become a powerful pillar guarding world peace, and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De have received the eternal praise of all ethnic groups in the country and progressive people all over the world.

Female Chieftain Kongsa Deqin Wangmu

In northern Xikang, everyone knows Kongsa Chieftain Deqin Wangmu. This thirty-six-year-old female chieftain had her land and property confiscated by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the so-called "Garzê Incident" from 1938 to 1939. She and her husband, Kongsa Yiduo, were driven to Qinghai and lived a life of exile for many years. Her life vividly illustrates the Kuomintang reactionaries' use of high-pressure policies against ethnic minorities, provoking and expanding internal disputes among ethnic minorities, in order to achieve the purpose of bloody rule. When people see the ruins that still remain today around the Kongsa chieftain's stockade, which was burned down by the Kuomintang bandit army, it is not difficult to imagine the scene back then.

One afternoon, she received the comrades of the visiting group and reporters on her sickbed. First of all, she expressed her gratitude to the military doctor of our unit for diagnosing her illness. Although she rarely comes into contact with the outside world due to illness, from her praise of the People's Liberation Army and the deeds of fighting against difficulties, we can know that she is clear about the situation in Garzê since its liberation half a year ago. She mentioned a period of exile in Xining, and could not help but shed tears. She said: "Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, our ethnic minorities were like sparrows locked in a cage. The People's Liberation Army opened the cage door for us, and we can fly freely." Deqin Wangmu is a representative invited to this Kang District Nationalities Consultative Conference. She is ill and cannot go to Kangding to attend in person. She lamented: "This is a good learning opportunity for me, but unfortunately I easily let it go. In the past, our ethnic minorities were not united, giving the Kuomintang reactionaries a chance to provoke us. In the future, we must unite well. Although we are backward in all aspects, we hope to eliminate backwardness." Yes, this Tibetan woman, who dared to fight against evil forces in the past in a complex environment, is willing to do things for the Tibetan people. Under the leadership of the People's Government, she will definitely be able to serve the Tibetan people.

Galu Comes to See Head Liu

On the second day of the visiting group's arrival in Garzê, representatives from all walks of life in Garzê came to see Head Liu Geping one after another. Gongga Jiangze, the head of Mashu Township, Kongsa Yiduo, the head of Kongsa Township, Wengdui, the chieftain of Bairi, the Zhongsah Living Buddha of Garzê Lama Temple, Deng Deji from Zhanhua County, and representatives from Dajin Temple, all sent their regards to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. All praised the good mass discipline of the People's Liberation Army.

As the sun was setting, comrades from the Garzê County People's Government accompanied Galu from Daoga Village.

Galu, a simple Tibetan farmer, tall and with a red face. His attitude is so humble and his speech is so sincere that it makes one think that despite the years of destruction by feudal emperors and Kuomintang bandits, the fraternal ethnic groups in the distant border areas have retained their inherent and good qualities.

One day, Galu was passing by the bank of the Yalong River when he suddenly caught sight of a carbine in the rocks. Galu picked it up, looked at it, and touched it. He thought to himself: "Whose gun is this? Could it have been dropped by a comrade from the People's Liberation Army? Should I take it home? Should I return it to the People's Liberation Army?" The Tibetan people love guns. For self-defense, almost every family has a gun. Galu thought over and over: Should I take it home? If it was really dropped by a comrade from the People's Liberation Army, how could I be worthy of the People's Liberation Army? They came here without asking for "Ula," helping the people chop firewood and carry water, buying and selling fairly, and not taking a needle or a thread from the people. They are so good to us, how can we take the gun home? After some consideration, he finally handed the gun over to the local garrison.

The comrades of the visiting group warmly received Galu. Galu said: "I herd cattle in the mountains. I heard that Chairman Mao sent a representative, so I specially came to see Chairman Mao's representative. We have not seen Chairman Mao. Seeing his representative is like seeing Chairman Mao." Head Liu Geping greatly praised Galu's spirit and actions of cherishing the people's army. Galu said: "This is what should be done. Regardless of whether this carbine was dropped by a comrade from the People's Liberation Army, it is better for me to hand it over to the People's Liberation Army than to take it home, because the People's Liberation Army treats us too well." Only with the exemplary actions of the People's Liberation Army can they win the enthusiastic love of the broad masses of Tibetan people. The story of Galu handing over the carbine is just one example of many deeds in the advance into Kangzang.

Geda Living Buddha's Hometown—Senka

The visiting group stayed in Garzê for a few days and headed to Yulong Township in Dêgê County. The car followed the Yalong River straight westward for about thirty kilometers, arriving at Senka, the hometown of Geda Living Buddha, the former vice chairman of the Xikang Provincial People's Government.

The place where Geda Living Buddha ascended the throne – Bairi Lama Temple – is built at the foot of a high mountain in Senka. The Yalong River runs horizontally in front of the temple, and the islets in the river are full of lush pines and cypresses. The snow on the distant mountain peaks reflects the light of the sun, making this area appear serene and beautiful.

Geda Living Buddha is the Living Buddha most revered by the Tibetan people. In 1935, during the Red Army's stay in the Garzê area, he and Xia Ke Dao Deng, Bangda Duoji and others did their best to help the Red Army. When the Red Army transferred to Qinghai, he and Xia Ke Dao Deng and others used local armed forces to contain Ma Bufang's bandit army. After the Red Army transferred, he tried every means to shelter and help the sick and wounded who could not transfer with the main force of the Red Army. Before and after the liberation of the Garzê area, Vice Chairman Geda vigorously supported the People's Liberation Army, planning for grain and firewood. He also did much publicity and explanation to the Lamas, chieftains, and headmen who did not understand the People's Liberation Army. He has made great contributions in these revolutionary works.

According to Bai Zhi, who broke through the enemy's blockade line before the liberation of Garzê, detoured to Qinghai, and went to Beijing to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Geda Living Buddha never forgets Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Because he often had contact with Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and others during the Red Army's stay in Garzê, he had a deep understanding of the Communist Party and the Chinese People's Armed Struggle. He often cared about the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. He once sent someone to Qinghai to secretly buy back the "Battle Map of the Eighth Route Army in Shanxi" and often told people from all walks of life in Tibet about the inevitable victory of the People's Liberation War.

When the visiting group visited Vice Chairman Geda, Vice Chairman Geda had already left Senka, but the picture of him in his youth hanging in his room, the "Battle Map of the Eighth Route Army in Shanxi" that had been posted for many years, his spirit and deeds of wholeheartedly serving the Tibetan people, and the warm welcome and reception of all the Lamas in the temple gave us great encouragement and education.

Visiting Group in Yulong

The Central Visiting Group's visit to Yulong Township in Dêgê County, and the cordial meeting between Head Liu Geping and Vice Chairman Xia Ke Dao Deng, was a major event for the Tibetan people of Yulong.

Vice Chairman Xia Ke Dao Deng vigorously helped the Red Army when the Red Army marched north to resist Japan. The visiting group visited Yulong to convey Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's thanks to him.

After the liberation of the Garzê area, Vice Chairman Xia Ke Dao Deng supported the People's Liberation Army with vigorous actions, raising grain and grass, and assisting in transportation. The amount of transportation provided under the leadership of Vice Chairman Xia Ke Dao Deng is estimated to be equivalent to 700 cars, 16 airplanes, and 30,000 people transporting goods from Xinjin, Sichuan to Garzê, thereby accelerating the liberation of Qamdo. Only the national policy of the CPPCC Common Program can win the support and praise of the broad masses of Tibetan people and enable them to contribute such huge manpower and material resources to support the advance into Tibet. The visiting group specially conveyed the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao and the Southwest Military and Political Committee's cordial greetings to the Tibetan people in this area.

The visiting group stayed in Yulong for two days. Tibetan representatives from Dêgê, Baiyu, and Shiqu, representatives from Lama temples, and cattle farm owners presented hadas and gifts to Chairman Mao's representatives. Head Liu Geping conveyed Chairman Mao's concern for the Tibetan people to them. Herdsmen from cattle farms came from afar to watch the various programs performed by the visiting group's art troupe. Although the visiting group's visit to Yulong only lasted for two days, the Tibetan people of Yulong's enthusiasm and sincerity in welcoming us are deeply imprinted in the minds of the comrades of the visiting group.

### 访问康北

    访问康北
    卡桑错池旁的觉日寺
    驶向甘孜的汽车，通过炉霍附近的草原，通过高山、峡谷和大松林，到达离甘孜六十余公里的朱倭。
    朱倭，海拔三千多公尺，新下的雪压住山峰，觉日喇嘛寺的倒影静静地映入卡桑错海子（池）。
    一九三五年，中国工农红军北上抗日时，路过朱倭，朱总司令和刘伯承将军曾在觉日寺住了几天。
    朱倭的藏族人民和觉日寺已故活佛帐士角穹，曾给远道跋涉的红军以很多的帮助。当红军快到朱倭时，朱倭的藏族人民，误信了国民党反动派的谣言，纷纷逃避；但是，红军在朱倭尊重藏族人民风俗习惯和保护喇嘛寺的实际行动，深深感动了寺内活佛和喇嘛，他们叫回了附近的老百姓，借出大批粮食和炊事家具给处境困难的红军。红军由朱倭向甘孜、玉树转移时，觉日寺还送了许多帐篷和藏靴，当地藏民仁青、牙可等还给红军带路。
    中央西南各民族访问团的专车到了朱倭，觉日寺的喇嘛群集公路两旁，欢迎毛主席、朱总司令派来的代表，刘格平团长对于朱倭藏族人民和觉日寺给红军的帮助特致谢意。觉日寺管家格桑秩龄滔滔地叙述当年红军过境时的情景，并历数朱倭人民所受国民党反动派的迫害。红军走后，国民党反动派队伍到了朱倭，抢走了红军送给觉日寺的锦旗和礼物，掳去了因伤因病不能随红军主力转移而隐蔽在朱倭的红军战士，经过多年来的苦难，朱倭人民更加贫穷，能劳动的男女也大大减少了。
    朱倭藏族人民念念不忘毛主席、朱总司令和刘伯承将军。当全寺喇嘛们看到中央访问团刘团长给该寺活佛和管家戴上毛主席纪念章时，都感动极了。
    喇嘛们引着访问团的同志们去瞻望朱总司令和刘伯承将军当年歇宿过的地方。在红军离开朱倭十五年后，在朱倭人民饱经长期苦难后，他们再一次见到了人民队伍的旌旗，又见到了毛主席、朱总司令派来的代表。他们今天所见到的人民解放军和十五年前所见到的红军、情况却完全不同了。中国革命形势已有了天翻地覆的转变，国民党反动政权宣告死亡，中国人民武装已成为拱卫世界和平的有力支柱，毛主席、朱总司令受到了全国各族人民和全世界进步人类永恒的歌颂。
    孔萨女土司德钦汪母
    在西康北部，人人都知道孔萨土司德钦汪母的。这位三十六岁的女土司，在一九三八年到一九三九年所谓“甘孜事件”中，土地财产曾遭国民党反动派没收，她和她丈夫孔萨益多被赶到青海，过了多年的流亡生活。她的生平，活生生地说明国民党反动派对少数民族使用高压政策，挑拨和扩大少数民族内部的纠纷，以达到血腥统治的目的。当人们看到孔萨土司寨子周围曾遭国民党匪军烧毁的今天尚残留着的败瓦颓垣时，就不难想像当年的情景了。
    一天下午，她在病榻上接见了访问团的同志和记者。首先，她对我某部军医给她诊病表示感激。尽管她因病极少和外间接触，从她颂扬人民解放军和困难作斗争的事迹中，可以知道她是清楚甘孜解放半年来的情形的。她提起在西宁时的一段流亡生活，情不自禁地掉下泪来。她说：“在国民党反动派统治下，我们少数民族就像关在笼里的雀子，解放军给我们打开笼门，我们可以自由地飞翔了。”德钦汪母是这次康区民族协商会议被邀请的代表。她在病中，不能亲往康定出席，她慨叹地说：“这对于我，是一次好的学习机会，可惜轻易地放过去了。过去，我们少数民族内部不团结，给国民党反动派以挑拨的机会。今后，我们要好好团结起来，我们各方面虽然落后，但是，我们是希望消灭落后的。”是的，这位在过去错综复杂的环境中，敢于向恶势力作斗争的藏族妇女，她愿意给藏族人民做事情，在人民政府领导下，她一定能够为藏族人民服务的。
    噶鲁来见刘团长
    访问团到达甘孜的第二天，甘孜藏族各界代表纷纷来见刘格平团长。麻书乡乡长贡呷降泽、孔萨乡乡长孔萨益多、白利土司翁堆、甘孜喇嘛寺仲萨活佛、来自瞻化县的邓德吉和大金寺的代表等，一致向毛主席、朱总司令问好。一致颂扬人民解放军良好的群众纪律。
    太阳偏西时，甘孜县人民政府的工作同志陪着道噶村的噶鲁来了。
    噶鲁，朴实的藏族农民，高高的个子，红红的面孔。态度是那么谦和，说话是那么诚恳，使人连想到尽管经过封建帝王和国民党匪帮多少年的摧残，远处边陲的兄弟民族却保留了他们民族固有的、良好的品质。
    一天，噶鲁打从雅砻江边经过，忽的瞥见乱石丛中有一枝卡宾枪，噶鲁把它拾了起来，看了又看，摸了又摸。心里想：“这是谁的枪呢？是不是解放军同志掉下的呢？拿回家去吗？送还解放军吗？”藏族人民是喜爱枪的，为了自卫，几乎每家都有枪。噶鲁左想右想：拿回家去吗？假若真的是解放军同志掉的，又怎对得起解放军呢？他们来到这里，不支“乌拉”，帮助老百姓砍柴、挑水，公买公卖，不拿人民一针一线。他们对咱老百姓这样好，咱又怎好把枪带回家呢？经过一番考虑，终于把枪送交当地的驻军了。
    访问团的同志热烈地招待噶鲁，噶鲁说：“咱在山地放牛，听说毛主席派代表来了，特地赶来见一见毛主席的代表，咱们没有见过毛主席，见了他的代表，就像见了毛主席一样。”刘格平团长对于噶鲁这种爱护人民军队的精神和行动大大地赞扬。噶鲁说：“这是应该的，不管这枝卡宾枪是不是解放军同志掉的，我交给解放军总比拿回家去好得好，因为解放军对待我们太好了。”有了解放军模范的行动，才能博得广大藏族人民热烈的爱戴，噶鲁送出卡宾枪的故事，不过进军康藏许多事迹中的一个例子吧了。
    格达活佛的家乡—森卡
    访问团在甘孜停留了几天，向德格县的玉隆乡进发。汽车循着雅砻江直向西行，约三十公里，到达前西康省人民政府副主席格达活佛的家乡——森卡。
    格达活佛的坐床处——白利喇嘛寺——建筑在森卡的高山脚下，寺前横着雅砻江，江中小洲上长满了青翠的松柏，远处山头的积雪，反射出太阳的光芒，显得这一地带的幽美。
    格达活佛，是藏族人民所最崇爱的活佛，一九三五年，红军在甘孜地区驻留期间，他和夏克刀登、邦达多吉等曾竭尽力量帮助红军。红军向青海转移，他和夏克刀登等，用地方武装牵制了马步芳匪军。红军转移后，他曾想尽办法，掩护并接济不能和红军主力转移的伤病员。甘孜地区解放前后，格达副主席大力支援人民解放军，筹划粮食柴草，喇嘛、土司、头人等有对解放军不了解的，又多方的宣传解释，他在这些革命工作中，是有着很大功绩的。
    据曾于甘孜解放前，冲破敌人的封锁线，绕道青海，前往北京向毛主席、朱总司令致敬的白志告诉记者：格达活佛是念念不忘毛主席、朱总司令的。由于红军在甘孜期间，他和朱总司令等经常接触，对于共产党和中国人民武装斗争是有深刻了解的。他经常关怀中国人民的革命斗争，曾经派人前往青海暗地里买回“八路军山西奋战图”，又经常向藏族各界人士讲述人民解放战争的必然胜利。
    访问团访问格达副主席时，格达副主席已离开了森卡，但他室内挂着的他年轻时的照片，贴着多年的“八路军山西奋战图”，他诚心诚意为藏族人民服务的精神和事迹，以及全寺喇嘛热诚的欢迎和招待，使我们得到了很大的鼓舞和教育。
    访问团在玉隆
    中央访问团访问德格县玉隆乡，以及刘格平团长和夏克刀登副主席亲切的会见，这对玉隆的藏族人民来说，是一件大事情。
    夏克刀登副主席在红军北上抗日时大力帮助红军，访问团访问玉隆，特传达毛主席和朱总司令向他致谢的意思。
    甘孜地区解放后，夏克刀登副主席以有力的行动，支援了人民解放军，筹借粮草、协助运输，以夏克刀登副主席为首的所出的运输量，据初步估计，等于七百辆汽车、十六架飞机、三万人从四川新津运到甘孜的运输量，从而加速了昌都的解放。只有政协共同纲领的民族政策，才能获得广大藏族人民的拥戴和颂扬，才能使他们献出如此庞大的人力和物力来支援西藏的进军。访问团特传达中央人民政府和毛主席及西南军政委员会向这一地区的藏族人民致亲切的慰问。
    访问团在玉隆停留了两天，来自德格、白玉、石渠的藏民代表、喇嘛寺的代表和牛场主人纷纷向毛主席的代表献哈达和礼物。刘格平团长向他们传达了毛主席对藏族人民的关怀。牛场的牧民远道前来争看访问团文艺组演出的各种节目。访问团在玉隆访问的时间虽仅两天，但是，玉隆藏族人民欢迎的热情和诚意，访问团的同志们是深深印在脑海的。
