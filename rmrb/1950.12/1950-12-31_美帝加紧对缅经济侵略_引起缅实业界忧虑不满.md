Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 27th: The intensification of U.S. imperialist economic aggression against Burma since the implementation of the U.S.-Burma Economic Agreement has aroused increasing concern and dissatisfaction among Burmese business circles. An American economic and technical delegation, led by Moffat, former Deputy Director of the ECA London branch, and including a large number of American experts, has entered Burma in succession, according to the bilateral agreement on U.S.-Burma economic cooperation signed in September. They have infiltrated all departments of industry and economy, using the privileges granted by the Thakin Nu government to try to make them conform to American interests. Recently, in order to implement the U.S. government's instructions to block strategic materials, the delegation has openly interfered in Burma's foreign trade. It is reported that the U.S. delegation formally requested the Thakin Nu government to reduce the sale of petroleum and petroleum products to China to a minimum, and instructed the Burmese government to implement strict controls in border cities such as Bhamo and Lashio in order to cut off all possibilities of trade along the Yunnan-Burma Road. As a result of American interference, Burma's oil trade has almost come to a standstill.

Many Burmese political figures are already worried that the Burmese economy will accelerate its colonization, and have expressed dissatisfaction with American aggression. For example, U Tun Min, a member of parliament from the Shan State border region, said: "The U.S.-Burma agreement is a man-eating tiger. We should be vigilant at all times. A slight carelessness will plunge the country into an abyss. We should learn from the actual results of Western European countries accepting Marshall Plan aid." U Chan Tun, a legal advisor to the Union, pointed out at a press conference: American aid to Burma is by no means out of goodwill. The funds for American aid to Burma are drawn from the funds for aid to Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the Burmese government must be vigilant and not repeat Chiang Kai-shek's mistakes. Writer U Tun Pe wrote in the New Light of Burma newspaper that the U.S.-Burma agreement will turn Burma into a U.S. military supply base. Any country that accepts U.S. aid will eventually fall into the clutches of the dollar kingdom and be at its mercy.

    美帝加紧对缅经济侵略
    引起缅实业界忧虑不满
    【新华社二十七日讯】仰光消息：美帝国主义在美缅经济协定实施后对缅甸经济侵略的加紧，业已引起缅甸实业界日益增长的忧虑和不满。以前经合总署伦敦分署副署长摩法特为首的美国经济技术代表团，包括大批美国专家，根据今年九月间签订的美缅经济合作双边协定，已陆续进入缅甸。他们渗入了工业与经济的各部门，运用达钦努政府所给予的特权，力图使之符合于美国的利益。最近该代表团为实施美国政府封锁战略物资的训令，更公开干涉缅甸对外贸易。据悉：美国代表团曾正式要求达钦努政府将卖给中国的石油和石油制造品减至最低限度，并指使缅甸政府在八莫和腊戌等边境城市实行严密的管制，以断绝沿滇缅路进行通商的一切可能。由于美国干涉的结果，缅甸公司的石油买卖几全陷于停顿。
    许多缅甸政界人士即已忧虑缅甸经济将加速殖民化，并对美国的侵略表示不满。如掸部边区议员宇吞敏说：“美缅协定是一个吃人的老虎，我们应时刻提防，稍一不慎，将使国家陷入深渊。西欧各国接受马歇尔计划援助的实际结果应引为我们的殷鉴。”联邦法律顾问宇千吞在记者招待会中曾指出：美国援助缅甸决非出于善意，美国援缅的款项是从援助蒋介石的款项中抽出的一部。因此，缅甸政府必须提高警惕，不要重蹈蒋介石的覆辙。作家宇邓拍在新光报撰文说：美缅协定将使缅甸变为美国的军事供应地。凡接受美援的国家，终将陷入金元王国的网罗而任其宰割。
