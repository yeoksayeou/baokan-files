    Anshan Electric Power Bureau Party Members Take the Lead in Repairing Lines
    Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Liaodong Provincial Party Committee Organization Department Commend Them in a Circular
    The Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a circular:
    In the face of frantic bombing and strafing by American aircraft, the Party organization of the Anshan Electric Power Bureau firmly led the workers in completing the arduous task of repairing lines. This demonstrated the revolutionary heroism of the Communist Party members and the working class. They supported the great movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country through their courageous actions in repairing lines and ensuring power supply. We call on all cadres, Party members, and the entire working class in Northeast China to learn from their selfless and model patriotic behavior, stand firmly at their posts, ensure that they persevere in work and production under any circumstances, and comprehensively launch a patriotic production competition. They should protect our country and our free and happy lives through practical actions of completing and exceeding production plans.
    Circular from the Organization Department of the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee
    Since November 8, American imperialism has been frantically bombing Anshan. High-voltage lines have been bombed and cut off four times, causing power outages. The key responsible cadres, all Party members, and workers of the Anshan Electric Power Bureau, under the battle cry of "As long as there is electricity, the Anshan Electric Power Bureau guarantees power supply," demonstrated the revolutionary heroism of Communist Party members and the working class, unafraid of danger and sacrifice. They persisted in and completed the arduous task of repairing lines under continuous bombing and strafing by American aircraft.
    On the morning of the 8th, the transmission line was damaged for the first time. At that time, thick smoke filled the sky, and flames soared. Comrade Lü Qizhang (Party member), chairman of the trade union; Comrade Jin Jingyou (probationary Party member, Korean worker); Comrade He Gengxin (Party member), chief of the power distribution section; and Comrade Xiao Yuheng (Party member), chief of the internal line section, led by Comrade Wang Qi, technical director of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau, risked advancing and inspecting the lines along the way or carrying out repairs under the tense circumstances of continuous low-altitude strafing by American aircraft. Comrade Jin Jingyou traveled back and forth several times and did not sleep for three days. The leaders of the Electric Power Bureau advised him to rest. He said, "I cannot rest. I was nurtured and raised by China since I was a child. Today, the Chinese people are actively resisting America and aiding Korea, so I should work even harder."
    Transmission workers Su Facheng (Party member) and Yin Qinhua (Party member) worked on the iron towers, regardless of the American aircraft strafing, and completed the repair task. Comrade Su Facheng worked all afternoon on the 8th and all night. On the morning of the 9th, the line was bombed again. Regardless of his fatigue and nausea, he immediately participated in the repair again.
    Comrade He Gengxin, chief of the power distribution section, did not rest for three days and nights, being brave, calm, and actively working hard. When some comrades in the repair team were afraid, he constantly carried out political mobilization and led the entire team to complete the repair task.
    Comrade Xiao Yuheng had been criticized in the past for not being diligent enough in his work. This time, he performed very well in the repair, working continuously for three days and nights without complaining. Comrades Kang Qingbao and Meng Chuanren also showed great enthusiasm. When the American aircraft came, they insisted on repairing and refused to come down to hide. They said, "We will go down after completing the task."
    During the four repairs, Li Guanglin (Party member), director of the Electric Power Bureau, Li Deyun, secretary of the CPC branch, and Lü Qizhang, chairman of the trade union, personally led the repairs at the site. The workers were afraid that they would be injured and advised them, "We can complete the task, you don't have to come and avoid danger." However, they always insisted on being at the site. This exemplary action of the cadres further encouraged the heroic repair of lines by all the repair workers.
    This fearless and selfless spirit is the noble quality of Communist Party members and the heroic behavior of the working class who love their country. We call on all cadres, Party members, and workers in Liaodong Province to learn from the model actions of Comrades Li Guanglin, Li Deyun, Lü Qizhang, Su Facheng, Yin Qinhua, Jin Jingyou, Xiao Yuheng, He Gengxin, Kang Qingbao, and Meng Chuanren, and other workers. We hope that Comrade Li Guanglin and other ten comrades and all their fellow workers will continue to work hard to complete the glorious task of repairing lines.

    安东电业局党员带头抢修线路
    中共中央东北局组织部与辽东省委组织部通报表扬中共中央东北局组织部通报：
    安东电业局党的组织在美机的疯狂轰炸与扫射的严重情况下，坚定地带领着工人群众，完成了艰巨的抢修任务，高度表现了共产党员和工人阶级的革命英雄气概，以英勇的抢修线路，保证供电的实际行动，支援着伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国运动。我们号召全东北的干部党员及全体工人阶级学习他们奋不顾身忘我的模范爱国行为，坚定地站在自己的岗位上，保证在任何情况下坚持工作，坚持生产，全面开展爱国主义的生产竞赛，以完成和超过生产计划的实际行动，来保卫我们的祖国和我们自由幸福的生活。
    中共辽东省委组织部通报
    自十一月八日起，美帝疯狂轰炸安东。高压线路曾四次被炸断而停电。安东电业局的主要负责干部、全体党员及工人，在“只要有电，安东电业局保证送电”的战斗口号下，表现了共产党员和工人阶级不怕危险不怕牺牲的革命英雄气概。在美机不断的轰炸扫射下，坚持和完成了艰巨的抢修任务。
    八日上午，送电线路第一次被破坏，当时浓烟蔽日，火光满天。工会主任吕其章（党员），工人金景佑（候补党员，朝鲜籍工人），配电科长贺更新（党员），内线股长萧玉恒（党员）等同志，由东北电业局技术处长王琦同志率领着，在美机不断地低空扫射的紧张情况下，冒险前进，检查沿途线路或进行抢修。金景佑同志，数度来往奔波，三天没有睡觉。电业局领导同志曾劝他休息。他说：“我不能休息，我从小是中国培养大的，今天中国人民积极抗美援朝，我更应加倍努力。”
    送电工人苏发成（党员）、尹勤华（党员）爬在铁塔上工作，不顾美机扫射，完成抢修任务。苏发成同志在八日干了一下午，晚上干了一夜。九日晨线路又被炸断。他不顾疲劳，不顾呕吐，立即又参加了抢修。
    配电科长贺更新同志，三夜一天没休息，勇敢沉着，积极苦干。当抢修小队中有个别同志骇怕时，他就不断地进行政治鼓动，领导全队完成抢修任务。
    萧玉恒同志过去曾因工作不够紧张，而受过批评，这次抢修中表现很好，连续干了三夜一天，从不叫苦。工友康庆保、孟传仁也表现非常积极。美机来时，坚持抢修工作，不肯下来隐蔽，他们说：“完成任务再下去。”
    在四次抢修中，电业局长李广林（党员）、中共支部书记李德云、工会主任吕其章亲自到现场领导抢修，工友们害怕他们负伤，劝告他们说：“我们可以完成任务，你们可以不来，免遭危险。”但是他们始终坚持在现场。干部的这种模范行动，更加鼓舞了全体抢修工人的英勇的抢修线路。
    这种大无畏的忘我精神，是共产党员高尚的品质，是工人阶级热爱祖国的英勇行为。我们号召辽东省全体干部、党员和工人，向李广林、李德云、吕其章、苏发成、尹勤华、金景佑、萧玉恒、贺更新、康庆保、孟传仁等十同志及其他工人同志的模范行动学习。并望李广林等十同志及其全体工友同志继续努力完成抢修线路的光荣任务。
