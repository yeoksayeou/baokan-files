(II) Measures for Compiling Currency Revenue and Expenditure Plans

Chapter I General Principles

Article 1: These measures are formulated in accordance with Chapter II of the Implementation Measures for Currency Management.

Article 2: The currency revenue and expenditure plan is a detailed numerical plan for the business operation or budget of each unit, that is, the deposit, loan, allocation, and cash use plan submitted by each unit to the bank. The bank supervises revenue and expenditure, carries out settlement, and considers loans according to this plan to help each unit accelerate capital turnover, strictly implement the budget, and promote the completion of the national financial and economic plan.

Article 3: Currency revenue and expenditure plans are divided into two types: unit currency revenue and expenditure plans and comprehensive currency revenue and expenditure plans. The unit currency revenue and expenditure plan is compiled by each independent accounting unit, and the comprehensive currency revenue and expenditure plan is compiled by banks at all levels.

Article 4: The currency revenue and expenditure plan of each unit should be compiled on the principle of maximizing the use of its own funds, reducing borrowing, promoting allocation, and saving cash.

Article 5: Currency revenue and expenditure plans are divided into quarterly and monthly types: the quarterly plan should be specific to the month, and should clearly distinguish revenue and expenditure items and cash transfers, and should be compiled in detail. If there are indeed difficulties in compiling quarterly plans for each unit, monthly plans may be started first, but units that can compile quarterly plans or are suitable for quarterly plans should still compile quarterly plans.

Article 6: The total revenue and expenditure of the currency revenue and expenditure plan must be balanced. If revenue exceeds expenditure, it should be included in bank deposits; if expenditure exceeds revenue or there are reasons such as early expenditure and late revenue that require borrowing from the bank, it should be handled in accordance with Chapter IV of the Implementation Measures for Currency Management.

Article 7: The amount of the currency revenue and expenditure plan, the unit currency revenue and expenditure plan is in units of 1,000 yuan RMB, the comprehensive currency revenue and expenditure plan, the branch bank is in units of million yuan, the branch above is in units of 100 million yuan, if there are foreign currency or in-kind payments, it should be converted into RMB (except for the public grain part, it should all be transferred through the bank).

Article 8: No matter how many accounts are opened in the designated bank in the same place, each unit must compile a currency revenue and expenditure plan as an independent accounting unit, and compile a supplementary table of the currency revenue and expenditure plan according to the opened account, but the same independent accounting unit with institutions scattered in various places should compile currency revenue and expenditure plans separately and send them to the local bank.

Article 9: When compiling the currency revenue and expenditure plan, all mutual exchanges between units, except for daily miscellaneous small amounts of revenue and expenditure that can be used as cash, shall be calculated as transfers. All exchanges with private enterprises or individuals and payment of wages and travel expenses shall be calculated as cash.

Chapter II Compilation Method of Unit Currency Revenue and Expenditure Plan

Article 10: The unit currency revenue and expenditure plan should be compiled according to the different situations of each unit, based on its business operation plan (such as production plan, sales plan, purchase plan, financial plan, etc.), all budgets (such as regular expense budget, temporary expense budget, special expense budget, etc.) or the tasks assigned by the higher level. It must also refer to the actual revenue and expenditure situation of the previous period, estimate the market seasonal changes of this period, and accurately calculate each item separately. Units with no or undetermined business operation plans, budgets, or tasks may compile according to past actual situations and future development estimates. For government agencies and troops with production income, when compiling the unit currency revenue and expenditure plan, in addition to their full budget, all revenue and expenditure that are not within the scope of the budget should be included.

Article 11: Military government agencies, troops, and public security departments may not list the items in detail when compiling the unit currency revenue and expenditure plan, only the total amount of cash and transfer revenue and expenditure. The unit currency revenue and expenditure plans of other relevant national defense departments may not list the items in detail with the approval of the competent department and the FEC at the same level, and this shall be handled in the same way (the items compiled into the comprehensive currency revenue and expenditure plan shall be separately ordered by the head office).

Article 12: All temporary purchasing and sales units established externally, their revenues and expenditures, shall be treated as transfers and included in the unit currency revenue and expenditure plan of their units. At the same time, a temporary unit fund use plan (same as supplementary tables 1 and 2) shall be compiled separately and sent to the bank in the purchasing and sales area in advance for handling revenue and expenditure. As for the long-term purchasing and sales units established externally, the unit currency revenue and expenditure plan that should be compiled shall still be handled according to Article 8.

Article 13: All units engaged in enterprise operations, whether government agencies or troops, shall compile unit currency revenue and expenditure plans separately.

Article 14: Local Bank of China, Bank of Communications, other specialized banks, and People's Insurance Company, etc., should compile unit currency revenue and expenditure plans according to their own business revenue and expenditure and expense expenditures, and send them to the local People's Bank.

Article 15: All processing fees incurred due to processing, whether their revenue and expenditure is in currency or in kind, should be included in their unit currency revenue and expenditure plan; the currency revenue and expenditure incurred due to consignment sales or purchases should be treated as transfers in the entrusting unit and included in their unit currency revenue and expenditure plan; in the agency unit, they should be included in their unit currency revenue and expenditure plan separately in cash and transfer.
