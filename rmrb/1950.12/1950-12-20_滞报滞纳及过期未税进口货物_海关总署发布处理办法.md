    Overdue Declarations, Late Payments, and Unclaimed Import Goods
    The General Administration of Customs Issues Handling Measures
    [From Our Newspaper] In order to strengthen cargo supervision, ensure customs revenue, reduce manifest backlog, and promote material exchange, the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government has, in accordance with the principles decided at the National Customs Affairs Conference held in June of this year, drafted the "Provisional Measures for Handling Overdue Declarations, Late Payments, and Unclaimed Import Goods by Customs," which has been submitted to and approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation by local customs offices, and the original methods for collecting manifest extension fees and late payment fees by various customs offices will be abolished. The General Administration of Customs has also instructed local customs offices that, after these measures take effect, they should immediately, based on the specific circumstances of each customs office, separately propose the time required for customs offices to handle inspection, valuation, and tax collection procedures, submit them for approval, and publicize them to the public in order to abide by them and demonstrate the spirit of the People's Customs in simplifying procedures. The full text of the measures is as follows:

    Provisional Measures for Handling Overdue Declarations, Late Payments, and Unclaimed Import Goods by Customs
    (Approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on October 26, 1950)

    Chapter I  Overdue Declaration

    Article 1 The consignee of imported goods or their agent shall, within fourteen days from the date of declaration of import of the means of transport carrying the goods (Sundays and customs holidays are included), submit an import declaration to the customs in accordance with the format prescribed by the customs. If the deadline is exceeded, the customs shall collect a late declaration fee. However, if a valid reason is provided and approved by the customs, the deadline may be appropriately extended.

    Article 2 The late declaration fee shall be calculated based on the duty-paid price of the goods. From the first day after the expiration date, a daily fee of two per mille shall be charged until the day before the declaration form is submitted to the customs.

    Article 3 If the consignee of imported goods or their agent fails to arrive at the site to handle inspection procedures within the inspection period prescribed by the customs after submitting the declaration form and receiving the inspection notice, it shall be regarded as undeclared. The inspection date shall be taken as the date of submission of the declaration form, and if the declaration period for imported goods stipulated in Article 1 of these measures has been exceeded, a late declaration fee shall be charged accordingly.

    Article 4 For foreign goods declared for transit abroad or to other domestic ports in accordance with customs regulations, if twenty-eight days have passed since the date of declaration of import of the original means of transport and the transit declaration has not been submitted, and no valid reason can be provided, a late declaration fee shall be charged from the twenty-ninth day until the day before the transit declaration form is submitted to the customs.

    Article 5 If foreign goods declared for transit are changed to an import declaration, they shall be treated as imported goods and handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 1.

    Chapter II  Late Payment

    Article 6 Customs duties, late declaration fees, and cargo taxes, harbor construction fees, wharf fees, etc., collected by the customs on behalf of others shall be paid within five days from the day following the date of issuance of the payment certificate by the customs (excluding Sundays and customs holidays). If the deadline is exceeded, the customs shall collect a late payment fee.

    Article 7 The late payment fee shall be calculated based on the total amount of taxes and duties listed on the payment certificate issued by the customs. From the first day after the expiration date, a daily fee of five per mille shall be charged until the day before the tax is paid.

    Chapter III  Unclaimed Import Goods

    Article 8 If three months have passed since the date of declaration of import of goods by the means of transport, and the goods have not been declared or have been declared but the tax has not been paid, the customs shall publicly sell the goods and use the proceeds to offset the following items in the following order:

    1. Expenses for selling the goods
    2. Customs duties
    3. Other taxes and levies collected by the customs
    4. Late declaration fees and late payment fees
    5. Fines
    6. Storage and miscellaneous fees

    Article 9 If the proceeds from the sale under the preceding article, after deducting various taxes and fees, have a surplus, the original consignee or their agent may, within six months from the date of sale by the customs, apply to the customs for a refund by presenting documents proving ownership of the goods. However, if there is a violation of trade control regulations, it shall still be handled in accordance with the trade control regulations. If no one applies within the time limit, the funds shall be transferred to the state treasury.

    Article 10 If imported goods are declared within three months from the date of declaration of import by the means of transport, but the customs fails to issue a tax payment certificate five days before the expiration of the time limit, the tax may be paid within five days from the day following the date of issuance of the tax payment certificate, and the goods shall be exempt from sale. If the tax is still not paid within this time limit, the goods shall be sold.

    Article 11 If imported goods are subject to mortgage or other disputes, the interested parties shall handle them themselves, and this shall not affect the customs' right to dispose of the goods.

    Article 12 When the customs takes delivery of the goods, it shall issue a receipt to the warehouse manager, who shall notify the manager of the original means of transport to inform the consignee.

    Article 13 For foreign goods declared for transit in accordance with customs regulations, if three months have passed since the date of declaration of import of the original means of transport and the goods have not been transited and no valid reason can be provided, they shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of each article of this chapter.

    Chapter IV  Supplementary Provisions

    Article 14 For imported passenger baggage, if six months have passed since the date of declaration of import by the means of transport and the goods have not been declared and the tax has not been paid, they shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III of these measures.

    Imported passenger baggage is not subject to late declaration fees or late payment fees.

    Article 15 These measures do not apply to imported postal items.

    Article 16 Late declaration fees and late payment fees shall be turned over to the treasury as customs fine revenue.

    Article 17 These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation upon approval by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, and the same shall apply to amendments.
