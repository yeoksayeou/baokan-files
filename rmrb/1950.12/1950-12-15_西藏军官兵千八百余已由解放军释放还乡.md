Xinhua News Agency, Kangzang Front: More than 1,891 Tibetan officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons during the Qamdo Campaign have been released in batches by the People's Liberation Army and given travel expenses to return home after a short period of study.

These Tibetan officers and soldiers all believe that the period of study was the happiest time of their lives. In class, they took notes in Tibetan; at group meetings, they spoke earnestly and held discussions. Whether day or night, one could hear them happily singing and chanting scriptures. At the end of the study, many officers and soldiers said: In the past, it was as if they were blind, but now their eyes are opened. They understand that if the Tibetan people want to be liberated, they must drive out imperialism and return to the big family of the motherland.

Before they took their travel expenses and passes and led their horses back home, they respectfully saluted the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. They hoped that Chairman Mao's light would shine on Lhasa soon, shining throughout Tibet. Some people even joyfully sang the ode "Chairman Mao's kindness is higher than the sky" in Tibetan.

    西藏军官兵千八百余
    已由解放军释放还乡
    【新华社康藏前线讯】在昌都战役中放下武器的西藏军官兵，经过短期学习后，已有一千八百九十一人分批由人民解放军发给路费，释放还乡。
    这些藏军官兵们都认为学习期间的生活是他们一生中最感愉快的一段日子。上课时，他们用藏文作笔记；开小组会时，他们认真发言，进行讨论。无论白天或晚上，都可以听到他们快活地唱歌和念经的声音。学习结束时，许多官兵都表示：过去好像瞎了眼的人，现在两眼才睁开了，明白了西藏人民要得到解放，只有赶走帝国主义，回到祖国的大家庭里来。
    当他们拿着路费和路证，牵着马匹返乡之前，都恭敬地向毛主席、朱总司令像行礼，他们盼望毛主席的光芒早日照到拉萨，普照全西藏。有的人还用藏语愉快地唱出了“毛主席的恩德比天还高”的颂歌。
