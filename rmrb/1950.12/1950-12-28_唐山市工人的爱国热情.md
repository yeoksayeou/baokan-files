    The Patriotic Enthusiasm of Workers in Tangshan
    By our reporter Lin Li

    Tangshan is a city with 80,000 industrial workers. Encouraged by the patriotic fervor to resist America and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, the workers have launched a wave of joining military cadre schools and competing in production.

    Yan Quanxin, a young worker at Qixin Cement Plant, firmly stated: In order to build a strong national defense force, resist American aggression, and defend peace in the Far East, he is determined to study at a military cadre school. Zhai Ruizhi, a lathe worker, is a lively and cheerful young man who, along with more than 30 fellow workers, had already requested to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to resist America and aid Korea. However, his turn had not yet come. Upon hearing the news about the enrollment of military cadre schools, he happily told everyone he met, "Now is the time to repay the motherland!" He and more than 30 fellow workers immediately signed up together. They said confidently: "We must strive to be learning models in military school; we must strive to be combat heroes in battle." This demonstrated the heroic spirit of the working class in loving the motherland. At the meeting to send them off to military school, there was Zhai Ruizhi's father, Yan Quanxin's sister, Chen Baotai's fiancée, and many other family members. Zhai Ruizhi's father said at the farewell meeting: "Military school is the most glorious post for young people. I have four more children, and if the people's motherland needs them, I will not hesitate to have them participate in the struggle and construction to defend our great motherland." His words moved all the elderly and encouraged the young people to forge ahead bravely. A storm-like applause erupted in the venue. Chen Baotai's fiancée spoke: "After he leaves, I will be responsible for everything at home!" There was another chorus of admiration from the crowd. Xu Ziliang, the chairman of the trade union, excitedly ran forward and said: "In the old society, when people mentioned workers, they always added the word 'stinky,' calling us 'stinky' workers; now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have become masters of the country. The navy and air force schools are also absorbing our workers. Young men, remember, the air force and navy schools of the old society did not want us workers. Now we have stood up. In order to defend our great motherland, we must study hard when we get to school and not let Chairman Mao down!" The workers sitting in the car, ready to leave immediately for military school, replied loudly, "Don't worry, Director!" They also hoped that the workers remaining in the factory would do a better job in production.

    The female workers in various factories in Tangshan demonstrated the same heroism as the male workers. Dozens of female workers from Huaxin Textile Factory had originally signed up to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to resist America and aid Korea. Among the 11 workers approved to apply for military school this time, 9 were female workers. When Kang Shuxian, Luo Ruizhang, Wu Aiqin, and others discovered that their height did not meet the application standards, they were so anxious that they cried bitterly, while those who were tall enough were extremely happy. They discussed with each other how to operate airplanes, warships, and tanks. The female workers Guan Fengzhu and another were applying at the same time as their lovers in Kailuan Mine.

    Some workers whose health was relatively poor or whose age was inappropriate repeatedly requested: "We can't fly planes or warships, but we can even be tank drivers in the army!" When they realized that these wishes were impossible to fulfill, and that the motherland also needed them to work hard in production, they consciously launched a production competition. Sun Lianwang, a worker from Tangshan Railway Factory who attended the National Congress of Labor Hero Representatives, took out the commemorative册 (albums) presented to the labor model representatives by the Central People's Government and other units and transferred them to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, writing at the beginning: "These precious souvenirs, I am reluctant to use myself; now I transfer them to you - the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army brothers. I hope that you will become a hero in killing the enemy in the victorious battle, and that we can meet and shake hands at the next conference of heroes!" Many workers wrote letters of condolence and donated a large number of comfort goods. In addition to the usual soap, toothpaste, towels, and other items, each item specified that it was their favorite thing. Choosing their most cherished things as comfort goods showed the working class's infinite concern for the People's Volunteer Army, and also showed the workers' infinite love for the motherland and the Korean people.

    Under the influence of the workers' patriotic actions, the families of the staff and workers of various mines and factories also enthusiastically participated in this patriotic movement. In the large number of comfort bags from the Shude Elementary School affiliated to Kailuan Mine, a child named Meng Fanliang wrote in his own verse on the comfort bag: "Volunteer Army, hurry up and work hard; Help Korea fight American imperialism! This bag is for you, consider it my little heart."

    The Tangshan workers know that the country needs them to produce more coal, steel, cement, trains, cloth, and various things sufficient to strengthen national defense. Sun Lianwang renamed his copper melting furnace "Resist America and Aid Korea" and, together with the Wu Kaiyun model group in the factory, issued a call to the 80,000 workers in Tangshan to launch a patriotic production competition. Zhao Naibin, the steel plant representative, and Li Xiujun, the power plant representative, who attended the National Congress of Labor Hero Representatives, took the lead in responding; then the staff and workers of the textile factory and cement factory also responded to this call. Their common slogan is: The factory is the battlefield, the machine is the weapon, and producing one more product adds one more point of power to resist America and aid Korea. Inspired by a high degree of patriotism, last month, the steel plant's steel ingot production completed 105.3% of the original plan, steel casting completed 107.8%, steel bar completed 105.3%, and the silica bricks of the refractory materials department completed 103%. All 280 production groups of the railway factory were involved in the production competition. Sun Lianwang's "Resist America and Aid Korea" copper melting furnace exceeded the factory's plan by 5%. When the Wu Kaiyun model group overhauled the No. 4 public service car, the standard working hours were reduced from 1,952 hours to 925 hours; when overhauling another soft-sleeper car, they saved another 282 hours. They used the saved working hours to help other workshops, which promoted the early completion of tasks in other workshops. Tangshan Power Plant, which created a new national record for coal consumption, had participated in the production competition of 28 peer factories in North China and East China. Under the conditions of "safe power generation and safe power supply," it further reduced coal consumption to 0.561 kg, so that the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of electricity was only 0.001 kg different from the advanced Soviet furnace-type generator coal consumption of 0.560 kg. In order to meet the needs of national defense, the workers of Qixin Cement Company automatically launched an increase in production competition, creating the highest production record of the factory in 44 years. In the Huaxin Textile Factory's competition to produce 20-count yarn, the original plan stipulated that each new car should produce 8.88 hanks of fine yarn per shift, and the old car should produce 7.35 hanks. As a result of the competition, the new car reached 9.03 hanks and the old car reached 7.47 hanks. During the competition period, the output of Desheng Porcelain Factory generally increased by 20%, and the damage rate dropped from 30% in the past to 5%.

    唐山市工人的爱国热情
    本报记者  林里
    唐山是一个拥有八万产业工人的城市，工人们在抗美援朝保家卫国的热情鼓舞下，掀起了参加军事干部学校，竞赛生产的热潮。
    启新水泥厂青年工人阎泉新，坚决表示：为建设强大的国防军，抵抗美国侵略，保卫远东和平，决心要到军事干部学校学习。旋盘工人翟瑞芝是个活泼愉快的青年，本来他和三十多位工友早就请求参加抗美援朝志愿军。但一直没有轮到他。他听到军事干部学校招生的消息，高兴的逢人便说：“这可是报效祖国的时候了！”他和三十多位工友，立即一起报了名。他们充满信心的说：“在军校要争取当学习模范；在战斗中要争取当战斗英雄。”表现了工人阶级热爱祖国的英勇气慨。在欢送他们起程赴军校的会上，有翟瑞芝的父亲，有阎泉新的妹妹，有陈宝泰的未婚妻和其他人的许多家属。翟瑞芝的父亲在欢送会上说：“军校是青年人最光荣的岗位。我还有四个孩子，如果人民的祖国需要他们，我将毫不犹豫地要他们参加保卫伟大祖国的斗争和建设工作。”他的话感动了所有的老人，也鼓舞着青年们奋勇前进。会场上响起了一阵暴风雨似的掌声。陈宝泰的未婚妻讲话了：“他走了，家中一切由我负责！”人丛中又是一片啧啧称羡的声音。工会主任许子良激动的跑上前去，他说：“在旧社会人们提到工人，都要加个‘臭’字，说我们是‘臭’工人；现在毛主席领导着我们成了国家的主人，海军、空军学校也吸收我们工人参加。小伙子们记着呀，旧社会的空军和海军学校是不要我们工人的。现在我们站起来了，为了保卫我们伟大的祖国，我们到学校里后，一定要好好学习，不要辜负了毛主席的期望！”坐在汽车上准备立即出发到军校去的工人们高声的答应着：“放心吧，主任！”他们并希望留厂的工友们把生产搞得更好。
    唐山市各厂的女工，表现了和男工一样的英勇。华新纺织厂原来有几十名女工报名参加抗美援朝志愿军，这次批准投考军校的十一名工人中，有九名是女工。当康淑贤、罗瑞章、吴爱琴等三人发觉自己身长不够投考标准时，急得抱头痛哭，身长够标准的人，都高兴异常。便互相议论着如何开动飞机、军舰和坦克。女工关凤珠等二人，是和她们在开滦矿的爱人同时报名的。
    有些身体健康程度较差，或年龄不适当的工人，再三要求：“我们不能开飞机、军舰，那怕到陆军去当个坦克车手也行！”当他们发现这些愿望都不可能实现，而祖国同样需要他们努力生产的时候，便自觉地展开了生产竞赛。出席全国工农兵劳模代表大会的唐山铁路工厂工人孙连旺，把中央人民政府等单位赠送劳模代表的纪念册拿出来，转送给抗美援朝志愿军，并于卷首写道：“这些珍贵的纪念品，我自己也舍不得用；现在转送给你——伟大的抗美援朝志愿军兄弟。希望你在胜利的战斗里，成为杀敌英雄，我们能在下一次的英模大会上见面握手！”许多工人都写了慰问信，赠送了大批慰劳品。慰劳品中，除了通常用的肥皂、牙膏、毛巾等物之外，每件物品上都写明这是他（她）们最心爱的东西。选择自己最珍爱的东西去作慰劳品，是表明工人阶级对人民志愿军的无限关怀，也表明工人们对祖国与朝鲜人民的无限热爱。
    在工人们爱国行动影响下，各矿厂职工家属也热烈地参加了这一爱国运动，在开滦矿附属淑德小学生的大批慰问袋中，有一个署名孟繁良的孩子，在慰问袋上写着他自己作的诗句：“志愿军，快努力；援助朝鲜打美帝！这个袋儿送给你，算是我的小心意。”
    唐山工人们知道，国家需要他们生产出更多的煤炭、钢铁、水泥、火车、布匹，以及各种足以加强国防建设的东西。孙连旺早把他的化铜炉改名为“抗美援朝号”，并和厂里的吴开云模范小组一起，向唐山八万职工发出爱国主义生产竞赛的号召。出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的钢厂代表赵乃斌、电厂代表李秀俊首起响应；接着纺织厂、水泥厂的职工也响应了这个号召。他们共同的口号是：工场就是战场，机器就是武器，多出产一件产品，就多一分抗美援朝的威力。在高度地爱国热情激动下，上月内，钢铁厂钢锭完成了原计划的百分之一零五点三，铸钢完成百分之一零七点八，钢条完成百分之一零五点三，耐火材料部的矽砖完成百分之一零三。铁路工厂的二百八十个生产小组，全都卷入生产竞赛，孙连旺的“抗美援朝”化铜炉，超过厂订计划的百分之五，吴开云模范小组在死修四号公务车时，由标准工时一九五二小时减为九二五小时；死修另一软席车时，又节省了二百八十二小时。他们用节省的工时去帮助其他车间，推动了其他车间提前完成任务。创全国煤耗新纪录的唐山发电厂，曾经参加了华北、华东等二十八个同业厂的生产竞赛，他们在“安全发电，安全供电”的条件下，再度减低煤耗至○点五六一公斤，使每度电的耗煤量，较先进的苏联炉炼式发电机煤耗○点五六○公斤，仅差○点○○一公斤。启新洋灰公司工人为适应国防需要，自动展开了增产竞赛，创造了四十四年来该厂生产的最高纪录。华新纺织厂竞赛生产二十支纱，原计划规定新车每工应产细纱八点八八亨司，老车要产七点三五亨司。竞赛结果，新车达到九点○三亨司，老车达七点四七亨司。德盛磁厂在竞赛期间，产量普遍提高百分之二十，破损率则由过去的百分之三十降为百分之五。
