Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 25th: Progressive newspapers across Europe, including the British Communist Party's Daily Worker, the French Communist Party's L'Humanité, the Czechoslovak Communist Party's Rudé Právo (Red Right), and the Romanian Communist Party's Scînteia (Spark), all published Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the United Nations General Assembly's illegal adoption of the so-called "Korean Armistice Three-Man Committee" in prominent positions on the 23rd or 24th. The headline in Rudé Právo was "Korea Must Restore True Peace, the Korean People Must Obtain True Freedom."

Scînteia also published an editorial on the matter, praising the heroic struggle of the Chinese and Korean people in defeating American imperialism as "a significant contribution to the cause of peace." The editorial stated: The stance of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has won the support of peace-loving people around the world. They know that only in this way can Korea achieve peace. The editorial concluded: Romanian peace fighters support the glorious struggle of the Chinese and Korean people, both in spirit and materially. This struggle will surely be victorious because it has the support of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union.
