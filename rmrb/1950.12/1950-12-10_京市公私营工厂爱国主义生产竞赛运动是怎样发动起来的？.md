    How Was the Patriotic Production Emulation Campaign in Beijing's Public and Private Factories Launched?
        (I)
    The Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland and Defend the Nation movement in Beijing's factories is driving an enthusiastic patriotic production emulation campaign. At the start of this campaign, the CCP branches, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations in Beijing's factories, combined with propaganda teams from various universities, conducted in-depth ideological education for the workers, thereby rapidly raising the workers' awareness, universally establishing the idea of hating, despising, and scorning American imperialism, and launching a fervent patriotic production emulation campaign.
    Accusation meetings are the most effective way to raise the ideological awareness of the workers. All factories in Beijing have held accusation meetings; some factories have even held them several times. When all the employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant held an accusation meeting in the repair workshop, veteran worker Chen Yuchun accused, "During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 when the Eight-Nation Alliance occupied Beijing, American devils drowned my two aunts and also killed my uncle and my great-uncle." At this point, he was too grief-stricken to continue, but there was something even more tragic. He continued to accuse, "I had a younger brother who was in junior high school. I don't know why, but he was arrested and killed by the Japanese devils. The Japanese devils nailed my brother's head to the city gate. At night, I went to steal the body. I secretly carried the headless corpse home on my back." Chen Yuchun fainted upon saying this, and all the workers in the audience were in tears. Workers in other factories also recounted the brutal acts of oppression and cruelty they or their family members personally experienced or witnessed at the hands of imperialists, and some also fainted. After these accusation meetings in various factories, the level of awareness of the workers generally increased. Workers wrote production emulation pledges to each other in the workshops and wrote resolutions of determination to their superiors, setting off a patriotic production emulation campaign.
    In addition, forms such as cartoons, short plays, comic dialogues, and shadow plays were used to carry out current affairs and ideological education. Propaganda workers Wang Songling, Tie Xiuqin, and others from the People's Printing Factory drew more than sixty cartoons depicting the history of American imperialist aggression against China and explained the content of the pictures to the workers. This gave the workers a deeper impression, and their level of awareness further increased. After seeing the cartoons, an old worker in the intaglio printing section said, "Some people still say that America is civilized. Look how ugly it is. It's worse than the Japanese devils." After seeing the cartoons of American economic aggression, the workers thought of their own past suffering of unemployment. They said, "So this is all the result of American imperialist economic aggression against China." Some of the cartoons used the personal experiences of the workers in the factory as material. For example, the father of worker Peng Cuirong was an anti-Japanese village cadre who was arrested by the Japanese invaders. The Japanese devils wanted to get information about the Eighth Route Army from him, but he firmly refused to say a word. The Japanese devils then cut off his ears in front of all the villagers and forced him to eat his bloody ears. When the workers saw this cartoon and heard Peng Cuirong's accusation, they jointly swore, "Peng Cuirong's father died for us, and we will avenge him." Railway workers in Beijing turned the fact that Wang Endi was murdered by American soldiers into a drama and performed it in various places, which had an even greater effect. Many workers were so moved that they immediately vowed, "Respond to the call of the Railway Bureau's patriotic production emulation campaign, respond to the call of the model worker Li Yong to exceed the axle load. Use production emulation to defeat American imperialist aggression."
    However, there are still some technicians in the factories who, on the one hand, have a low level of awareness, and on the other hand, are unwilling to conduct current affairs studies and believe that they know a lot. Some technicians said, "You say that America is imperialist, and I admit that. But I think American machines are pretty good." Therefore, it is necessary to patiently persuade and educate these people. The main method of education is to use forums and informal talks to educate them with their own personal experiences and raise their awareness. Students from Peking University held forums with some technicians at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, acknowledging that some American machines are indeed not bad, but who made these machines? Not the big American bosses, but the American workers. But what happens to American workers after they make so many good machines? They suffer from unemployment and hunger. Many technicians became interested in this discussion because they had seen these things with their own eyes. They held three consecutive forums and then participated in the workers' accusation meeting, recalling the oppression they had suffered from imperialism in the past, and their awareness gradually increased. Engineer Li Hanru recalled the discrimination he suffered when he interned in agricultural machinery in the United States and said indignantly, "In the past, I thought that the United States wanted Chinese students to study in the United States to train talents for China. This can't be considered bad. Now I know that they did this only to train salesmen for their goods. Fortunately, I am now a technician for improved farm implements in New China and have not been fooled by American imperialism." Zhang Dejun, Li Kezuo, Chen Li, and other six agricultural machinery engineers who had studied in the United States, based on their own experiences in the United States, presented many ugly facts about American imperialism, explaining that American imperialism is the enemy of peace-loving people all over the world and the enemy of the Chinese people. Finally, the vast majority of technicians stated on the spot, "We resolutely support the joint declaration of all parties, stick to our jobs, and can unconditionally obey the transfer of work."
    After this period of concentrated and in-depth current affairs and ideological education, the awareness of workers and technicians generally increased. Therefore, they expressed their determination to stick to their posts and work actively, and take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea, and the patriotic production emulation campaign has also been enthusiastically launched. The workers of the Fifth Institute of the 70th Arsenal guaranteed to the administration that in the patriotic production emulation campaign, the quality of products should reach 100%, and the output should be increased by 25%. The standard output of the Beijing Clothing Factory is seven suits of clothes per person per day, and generally only five or six suits can be made. After the launch of the production emulation, the average output of several units of the factory has reached nine suits. In particular, since the Liulihe Cement Plant launched the patriotic production emulation, production efficiency has rapidly increased. The turnover rate of the grinding workshop has increased from 90% to 100%, the bulk density of the kiln workshop has increased from 47% to 53%, and the loading and unloading workshop has also created a record high. The annual production task was completed on November 29.

            (II)
    In the East Factory of Beijing's private Yuhua Xing Weaving and Dyeing Factory, the production emulation in many workshops could not be started originally, but only the Huang Jinchi team not only started the emulation but also achieved very outstanding results. In October, the team's output ranked first in the factory, and the quality also created a record never seen before. All products met the specifications, and there was not a single piece of substandard cloth. The machines did not have a single accident, and the team gloriously won the factory's "Red Flag" banner. The trade union led the workers of the whole factory to analyze this reason, and the conclusion was that the Huang Jinchi team did a good job in current affairs study and earnestly absorbed the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang team in Northeast China.
    Based on the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, the factory's trade union, on the basis of the original piece-rate progressive wage and over-quota bonus system, consulted with the capitalists on the conditions and contents of the emulation and further promoted the experience of the Huang Jinchi team to the whole factory. The production emulation in the whole factory was immediately launched enthusiastically, and as a result, a brilliant victory of increasing production was fought in November.
    Closely integrating the team's production activities with the national patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea is the main link in Huang Jinchi's leadership team. He seized every spare moment to read newspapers to team members and chat with them, discussing current affairs. Even at workshop meetings, after discussing the production problems of the day, he often talked about the Korean War, and then turned around to link the newspaper's news of the day with production. As a result, he deeply understood why he should do a good job in production, and production became more and more energetic. From then on, the Huang Jinchi team had no difficulties that it could not overcome.
    At the beginning of the Korean War, their team closely followed the development of the war situation, reading newspapers and discussing it every day without interruption. The good news of the liberation of Seoul made them as happy as they were last year when they heard of the liberation of Shanghai and Nanjing. When Seoul and Pyongyang fell, they became anxious and wanted to write to Chairman Mao to advocate giving the Korean people strong support immediately. When they heard about the various bloody atrocities of the American imperialist beasts collectively shooting 700 women and children a day in Seoul, they felt infinitely angry, just like their own people were being massacred. After discussion, the team unanimously believed that "American imperialism is still trying to expand this act of aggression to China and drag us back to the kind of miserable days we used to live in. In order to defend our peaceful construction, we must crush American imperialist aggression." But how could the team take practical actions to strike at the enemy? Huang Jinchi introduced the situation of the patriotic production emulation campaign being carried out by workers in Northeast China in his newspaper reading. In response to the problems existing in the team's emulation, he absorbed the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang team, and they vowed to unite closely and help each other to do a good job in production to defeat American imperialism. The team exchanged experiences, checked machines, and checked quality with each other. Anyone who had good skills did not keep them to themselves, but made them public for mutual learning. If someone had something to do and left the workshop, others would help to operate the machine. If a machine broke down, others would help to repair it. The team also stipulated that the machines should be inspected every fifteen days, and there should be small inspections every day before driving to eliminate machine failures and strive not to delay a minute of production time. In the workshop, dining hall, or dormitory, they studied production anytime and anywhere, and did not relax any small link. The leather on the pressure lever of the loom was replaced as soon as it was found to be wearing out, while other teams waited until it could not be used before replacing it, which easily delayed two or thirty minutes. It is stipulated that the screws for tightening the striking rod should be tightened two times at any time. They do not despise this small matter, because if something goes wrong, it is necessary to add a shuttle, which will waste one or two hours, or even a whole day, affecting the production rate. They also made many improvements to the operation of the machine, such as improving the leather sleeve, which can extend the service life by one time; improving the spike, which can save yarn and reduce waste; and improving the heddle, which can prevent the edges of the woven cloth from breaking. Huang Jinchi also led the team members to look at the production record charts every day. Whoever's output fell behind, he would catch up in time.
    The voice of "Learn from the Huang Jinchi Team" resounded through every workshop from the end of October, and the whole factory enthusiastically and seriously engaged in reading newspapers and discussing current affairs. From the newspapers, the workers saw people in various places accusing American imperialism of its crimes, and then linked it to their own personal experiences, recalling the tragic situation of eating mixed noodles under the rule of the Japanese invaders in the past, recalling the various oppressions they suffered under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang manipulated by American imperialism, the workers worked day and night, and the wages they received sometimes could not maintain the food and clothing of one person, and they walked into the workshop with weak limbs, completely becoming oppressed slaves. Now the workers have become the masters of the country, and production has also returned to normal. Everyone firmly stated that they would defend their good days, support the front line with increased production, and smash the imperialist conspiracy of aggression. At the same time, they ideologically clarified that intensifying production and carrying out emulation in private factories cannot be seen as simply benefiting the capitalists, but also creating wealth for the country and consolidating the economic front.
    The workers learned the spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the Huang Jinchi team, and put forward specific goals, guaranteeing: "Machines will not have accidents," "People will rest, but machines will not," "One machine will produce one piece of cloth a day." The weaving teams were enthusiastically competing for the red flag. Before November, the difference between the teams was as much as seven or eight pieces of cloth. Now the difference is only a few tenths of a piece of cloth. Liu Congyi's work attitude was the most slack before. The original monthly output was only thirty-odd pieces, but now he can weave to sixty-two pieces, and the production rate has increased by nearly one time. Female workers who live outside the factory arrive at the factory on time to work before dawn, and the attendance rate of the whole factory has greatly increased, and the phenomenon of being late and leaving early has been basically eliminated. The movement to resist America and aid Korea is closely integrated with the production, learning, and life of the workers in the whole factory. The workers of the whole factory are divided into four groups: newspaper reading, written propaganda, entertainment, and family visits, to deeply promote the movement to resist America and aid Korea. They immediately helped others to realize the gains they had learned. The family visit team also improved the understanding of the families of the workers in the factory to resist America and aid Korea. "Who are the Korean sticks?" "Why did the American imperialists give us white flour to eat before?" How can family members resist America and aid Korea with practical actions to assist the government in eliminating special agents? These questions have generally been answered among the families of the workers in the factory. At the same time, after the ideological understanding of the family members has been improved, it has also greatly encouraged the production mood of the workers. Su Liming's grandmother is more than seventy years old. She often takes a picture of herself who was skinny and hungry from eating sweet potato in the era of Japanese invaders, and tells Su Liming, "If you don't produce well, if the imperialists come in again, you will have to live that kind of life again."
    In just one month of enthusiastic emulation in the whole factory, the production of Yuhua Xing Factory has greatly increased. At 6:00 pm on November 30, the red arrow of the production chart clearly showed the firm will of the workers to resist America and aid Korea. The arrow pointed out that the total output of the whole factory for the whole month was 913.12 pieces of cloth, an increase of 47% compared with October, and 7% higher than the highest output in April in the past. According to the personal labor productivity, the highest monthly output of cloth was 58.7 pieces, and now the highest is 65 pieces, and the average output is also 57.08 pieces. The quality is that the substandard cloth rate has dropped to 3.3%, which is a decrease of 19.7% compared with the highest substandard cloth rate of 23% in the past.
    In order to consolidate and develop the production results of November, the workers of the factory have formulated a plan for December to persist in the emulation, become a regular labor method, and vow to produce more cloth to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.

### 京市公私营工厂爱国主义生产竞赛运动是怎样发动起来的？

    京市公私营工厂爱国主义生产竞赛运动是怎样发动起来的？
        （一）
    北京市各工厂的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，是开展热烈的爱国主义生产竞赛运动。在这个竞赛运动开始时，北京市各工厂中的中共支部、工会、青年团，曾结合各大学的宣传队对工人群众，进行了深入的时事思想教育，因而能够迅速地提高了工人群众的觉悟，普遍树立起仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝的思想，展开了热烈的爱国主义生产竞赛运动。
    控诉大会是提高工人群众思想觉悟最有效的方法。北京各工厂都开过了控诉会；有些工厂甚至连开几次。石景山发电厂全体职工在修理车间召开控诉会时，老工友陈玉春控诉说：“庚子年间，八国联军占了北京时，美国鬼子淹死我两个姑姑，还杀死了我的大爷和叔叔。”这时他已悲痛得说不下去，但还有更悲痛的事情，他诉说：“我有一个弟弟，正念高小，不知道为什么，被日本鬼子抓去杀了。日本鬼子把我弟弟的头钉在城门上。晚上，我去偷尸。一个人背着没有头的死尸偷偷地回家。”陈玉春说到这里昏过去了，全场工友都流泪了。其他工厂的工人，也都历诉着他们亲身经受或是亲眼看到的帝国主义者欺压残忍的暴行，有的也昏过去了。各工厂经过这些控诉会后，工人群众的觉悟程度普遍提高了一步。工人们在车间就互相写生产竞赛书，并向上级写竞赛决心书，掀起了爱国主义的生产竞赛。
    此外还利用漫画、短剧、说相声、拉洋片等形式进行时事思想教育。人民印刷厂宣传员王松龄、铁秀勤等同志把美帝侵华史画成六十余幅漫画，按着画上的内容给工人讲解。这样，给工人们的印象更加深刻，觉悟程度又提高一步。凹印股一个老工人看了漫画以后就说：“有些人还说美国文明，你看它有多丑恶，它比日本鬼子还糟糕。”工人们看到美国经济侵略的漫画后，就联想到自己过去失业的痛苦，他们说：“原来这都是美帝国主义经济侵略中国的结果。”有的漫画是用本厂工人亲身的经历作为题材的。例如：工人彭翠荣的父亲是个抗日村干部，被日寇逮捕了。日本鬼子想从他嘴里得到八路军的消息，但他坚决未吐只字，日本鬼子于是在全村群众面前，割下他的耳朵，还逼着他把血淋淋的耳朵吃到肚里。工人们看见这幅漫画，又听了彭翠荣的控诉，共同宣誓：“彭翠荣的父亲是为我们死的，我们要为他报仇。”北京铁路职工，把王恩弟被美国兵残杀的事实编成话剧，在各地演出，它的效果更大。很多工人激动得当场宣誓：“响应铁路局爱国主义生产竞赛的号召，响应李永老英雄超轴运动的号召。用生产竞赛来击溃美帝的侵略。”
    但是工厂中尚有一部分技术人员，一方面是他们觉悟程度较低，但是另一方面又不愿进行时事学习，并认为自己知道的事情很多。就有些技术人员说：“你说美国是帝国主义，我承认。但是我认为美国的机器就不错。”因此必须对这些人进行耐心的说服教育。教育的方式主要是采用座谈会，漫谈会，以他们自己亲身经历的事实教育他们，提高他们的觉悟。北京大学同学在华北农业机械总厂，和一些技术人员进行座谈，承认有些美国机器就是不坏，但是，这些机器是谁制造的呢？不是美国的大老板而是美国的工人。可是美国工人制造了这么多精良的机器后怎样呢？他们却遭受着失业、饥饿的痛苦，这样许多技术人员对这种讨论发生了兴趣。因为这些事情，他们都是亲眼见过的。他们一连座谈了三次，最后又参加了工人的控诉大会，联想到自己过去所受帝国主义的压迫，觉悟逐渐提高了。李翰如工程师回忆自己在美国实习农业机械时所受的歧视，愤慨地说：“过去，我以为美国要中国学生到美国念书是为中国培养人材。这总不能算坏。现在，我才知道他们这样干，不过是培养他们货物的推销员罢了。幸亏我现在是新中国改良农具的技术人员，没有上美帝国主义的当。”张德骏、李克佐、陈立等六位留美农业机械工程师，根据自己在美国的切身经历，提出许多美帝的丑恶事实，说明美帝是全世界和平人民的敌人，是中国人民的敌人。最后绝大多数技术人员当场表示：“我们坚决拥护各党派的联合宣言，坚守在自己的工作岗位上；并可以无条件地服从工作的调动。”
    经过这一段集中与深入的时事思想教育后，工人和技术人员的觉悟普遍提高了。因此他们表示决心坚守在自己的岗位上积极工作，以实际行动抗美援朝，爱国主义的生产竞赛运动也就热烈展开了。七十兵工厂第五所工人向行政上保证：在爱国主义生产竞赛运动中，生产品的质量要达到百分之百的好，产量要提高百分之二十五。北京被服厂的标准产量是每天每人作七套衣服，一般的只能做到五、六套。发动生产竞赛后，工厂几个单位平均产量已达到九套。尤其琉璃河水泥厂自展开爱国主义生产竞赛后，生产效率迅速提高。磨房股的周转率从百分之九十增至百分之百，窑房股的立升重从百分之四十七增至百分之五十三，装运股也创造了最高纪录。于十一月二十九日完成了全年生产任务。
                                           （培蓝·蒋弘彬）
            （二）
    北京私营裕华兴织染工厂东厂的许多车间生产竞赛原来赛不起来，唯独黄进墀小组不单赛起来而且成绩非常出色。十月份该组产量占全厂第一位，质量上也创造了从来没有的纪录，全部产品都合乎规格，没有一匹次布，机器也没有出一件事故，光荣获得该厂“红旗”锦标。工会领导全厂工人分析这个原因，结论是：黄进墀小组的时事学习搞得好，并且切实吸取了东北马恒昌小组的先进生产经验。
    该厂工会本着劳资两利原则，在原来工资实行计件累进和超额奖励的基础上，同资方协商好竞赛条件和内容后，进一步把黄进墀小组的经验推广到全厂，全厂生产竞赛就立即热火朝天地展开，结果十一月里，打了一个辉煌的提高生产的大胜仗。
    把小组的生产活动和全国人民抗美援朝的爱国运动紧紧结合在一起，是黄进墀领导小组的主要环节。他抓紧每一空隙时间，给组员读报和组员漫谈，讨论时事。甚至在车间碰头会上，商量完当天生产问题之后，也往往谈起朝鲜战争，回过头来又把报纸当天新闻和生产联系起来谈。于是深刻地懂得了为什么要搞好生产后，生产就越来越有劲。从此，黄进墀小组就没有克服不了的困难。
    朝鲜战争一开始，他们小组就密切关心战局发展，每天读报、讨论，从不间断。汉城解放的捷报传来，他们跟去年听到解放上海南京一样地高兴；汉城平壤失守时，他们就急了，想上书毛主席主张立即给予朝鲜人民有力支援。当他们听到美帝野兽在汉城一天集体枪杀七百名妇女与儿童的种种血腥暴行，完全跟自己国家的人民被屠杀一样，爆发了无比的愤怒。小组里经过讨论一致认为：“美帝还妄想把这种侵略行为扩大到中国来，把咱们再拖到从前那种苦日子，咱们为保卫自己的和平建设，非粉碎美帝侵略不可。”但是小组里怎样以实际行动打击敌人呢？黄进墀在读报中介绍了正在开展的东北工人爱国主义生产竞赛的情况，针对着本小组竞赛中存在的问题，吸取马恒昌小组先进经验，他们誓以紧密地团结互助搞好生产来打垮美帝。小组里互相交流经验、检查机器、检查质量。谁有好的技术都不保留，公开出来互相学习。一个人有事离开车间，别的人帮助开机器。一台机器坏了，别人也帮助修理。小组还规定每隔十五天大检查机器一次，每天在开车之前有小检查，消灭机器故障，争取不耽误一分钟的生产时间。在车间、饭厅或宿舍里，他们随时随地都研究生产，对任何一个小环节也不放松。织布机压杆上的皮子，一发现快磨毁了就马上换修，别的组开起车临到不能用才换，就容易耽误二、三十分钟。对装紧打杆螺丝，规定随时要拧两搬子，他们不轻视这件小事，因为出了毛病，必须加梭，会浪费一两个钟头，甚至是一整天，影响生产率。他们对操作机器还有许多改进，如改进皮套，能延长一倍的使用时间；改进穗挺，能节约纱料减少浪费；改进综，使织出的布边不断线。黄进墀还领导组员每天看生产纪录图表。谁的产量落在后边，就及时追赶。
    “向黄进墀小组看齐”的声音，从十月底响遍每一个车间，全厂都热烈认真地搞起读报和讨论时事。工人们从报纸上看到各地人民控诉美帝罪行，再联系自己亲身经历，回忆起过去在日寇统治下吃混合面的悲惨情形，回忆在美帝操纵下国民党反动统治时，受尽种种压迫，工人干活不分白天黑夜的“连轴转”，所得工资有时不能维持一个人的温饱，走进车间里四肢无力，完全成了被压迫的奴隶。现在工人成了国家主人，生产也正常了，大家坚决表示要保卫自己的好日子，用提高生产支援前线，来粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋。同时，思想上更明确了：在私营工厂加紧生产开展竞赛，不能看成是单纯对资方有利，而是同时给国家创造了财富，巩固经济战线。
    工人们学习黄进墀小组团结互助的精神，提出具体奋斗目标，保证：“机器不出事故”，“歇人不歇马”，“一天一台机子出一匹布”。各织布小组热烈争红旗，十一月份以前组与组之间相差七、八匹布之多，现在只差零点零几匹布。刘从懿的劳动态度以前最懈松，原来月产量只到三十几匹，现在能织到六十二匹，生产率提高将近一倍。在厂外住的女工，天色不明就准时赶到工厂上班，全厂出勤率大大提高，迟到早退现象基本消灭。抗美援朝运动密切的和全厂工人的生产、学习、生活结合起来了。全厂工人分成读报、文字宣传、文娱、家庭访问四个小组，把抗美援朝运动深入推进。他们把自己学习来的收获立即帮助别人也能认识到。家庭访问小组使工人家属对抗美援朝的认识也提高了，“高丽棒子到底是什么人”？“美帝为什么以前给咱们白面吃？”家属怎样以协助政府肃清特务的实际行动抗美援朝？这些问题在该厂工人家属间一般都已能解答了。同时，家属的思想认识提高之后，对工人生产情绪也有很大鼓舞。苏丽明的老奶奶七十多岁了，常常拿着从前在日寇统治时代因吃白薯干身体枯瘦、饥饿的像片，告诉苏丽明说：“不好好生产，若是帝国主义再进来，就得还过那样生活。”
    仅仅一个月的全厂热烈竞赛，裕华兴工厂的生产大大提高了，十一月三十日下午六点钟生产图表的红线箭头，清楚地显示了工人们抗美援朝的坚强意志，箭头指出：全月全厂产量九一三·一二匹布，比十月份增加百分之四十七，比过去产量最高的四月份还高百分之七；按个人劳动生产率计算，以前最高月产布五十八·七匹，现在最高六十五匹，平均产量也达五十七·○八匹；质量是次布率降低到百分之三·三，比过去最高达到百分之二十三的次布率，减少了百分之十九·七。
    为了巩固与发展十一月份生产成绩，该厂工人订出十二月份计划，把竞赛坚持下去，成为经常的劳动方式，并誓为支援中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军，生产更多的布。
