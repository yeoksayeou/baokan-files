    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 21st: Wu Xiuquan, representative of our country to the United Nations Security Council, advisor Qiao Guanhua, and his party of nine, left the United States on the 19th. Before his departure, Wu Xiuquan issued the following statement to the press:

    "We wish the American people a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. We came here for peace, for the restoration of peace in the Far East. We have submitted a proposal to the United Nations Security Council to prevent the continuation and expansion of the war in the Far East. That is a proposal to stop the war. We believe that only by striving to stop the war can we truly extinguish the flames of war. Any scheme that deviates from this process is merely a trick and a conspiracy.

    Although our peaceful proposal to stop the war was rejected by the British and American ruling groups without due consideration, we are not disappointed. We will continue to fight for peace. The Chinese and American people have always had a deep friendship. We believe that no peace-loving American approves of the invasion of Taiwan and interference in Korea. We also believe that no peace-loving American is willing to cause a world war because of the invasion of Taiwan and interference in Korea. The people of the world, including the American people, are fervently demanding peace and opposing war. We believe that if the peace-loving people of the world unite closely, calmly distinguish right from wrong, and discern truth from falsehood, and are not deceived by a few war adventurers and war peddlers who insist on aggression, nor are they intimidated by them, but resolutely fight to uphold the truth, they will certainly be able to stop and prevent war. The Chinese people will fight together with all peace-loving people in America."

    Those who went to the airport to see off our delegation included Soviet representative Malik, Polish representative Katz-Suchy, Czechoslovak representative Noshek, as well as personnel from the United Nations Secretariat.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 21st: Wu Xiuquan, special representative of our country to the United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the accusation of US aggression against Taiwan, advisor Qiao Guanhua, and his party of nine, arrived in London by plane on the afternoon of the 20th. Wu Xiuquan made a statement to reporters at the airport, the full text of which is as follows:

    "Gentlemen of the press:

    In order to stop American aggression and restore peace in the Far East, we have proposed to the United Nations Security Council a plan in which the US government withdraws its armed forces from Taiwan, ceases interference in Korea, withdraws American and all other foreign troops, and the Korean issue is resolved by the Korean people themselves, as the basis for a peaceful solution to the Far East problem. This is a genuine plan to stop the war. However, the United Nations Security Council, under the manipulation of the American ruling clique, rejected our peace plan without consideration. American military adventurers are supporting the proposal of a "ceasefire first" in Korea with ulterior motives, attempting to deceive the people of the world, but everyone knows that only by striving to stop the war can the flames of war truly be extinguished. The true purpose of the so-called "ceasefire first" supported by American military adventurers is merely to tie the hands and feet of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, so that the American army can continue to invade and expand the war. Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of General Marshall, once used the same trick on the Chinese people. The Chinese people are not without experience in this regard, and we are willing to expose this deception to the peace-loving people of the world.

    It is not unexpected that the American minority ruling clique is doing this. They stubbornly refuse to recognize the existence of the People's Republic of China, obliterating its right to speak and represent on all Far Eastern issues related to China. They are wantonly interfering in China's internal affairs, stubbornly supporting the reactionary remnant clique of Chiang Kai-shek, and openly invading China. They are determined to be enemies with all 475 million people of China. The people of the world have seen that this reactionary policy of aggression by the United States is bankrupt. But in order to continue this bankrupt policy, the American ruling clique is fiercely preparing to push the whole world, East Asia and Western Europe, into the abyss of war. President Truman has publicly declared that he is considering using atomic bombs in the East, the US government has declared a state of emergency throughout the country, imposed a naval blockade and economic sanctions against the People's Republic of China, and in Europe it is recklessly restoring the Nazi military forces of West Germany. As a result of this policy of aggression and war by the American ruling clique, the whole world is facing a huge threat of war. However, the people of the world are against war. We believe that as long as the peace-loving people of the world unite, distinguish right from wrong, uphold the truth, and work hard, the war policy frantically pursued by the American ruling clique can be defeated.

    The Chinese people love peace and fervently hope to build their country peacefully without aggression or the threat of aggression. The Chinese government has always advocated using peaceful methods to solve the current major problems of the world, first of all, to peacefully solve the Far East problem caused by the armed aggression of Taiwan and Korea by the American ruling clique. Although the United Nations Security Council, under the manipulation of the American ruling clique, rejected our basic plan for a peaceful solution to the Far East problem this time, we will still make every effort to strive for a peaceful solution to the Far East problem, and we are willing to find ways to persuade the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to end their military operations of resisting American armed aggression, which they are forced to carry out together with the Korean People's Army.

    Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to pay my respects to the peace-loving people of Britain."

### 伍修权向美英报界分别发表声明  揭露美帝主张在朝鲜“首先停火”别有用心  强调只有停止侵略战争才能真正停止战火

    伍修权向美英报界分别发表声明
    揭露美帝主张在朝鲜“首先停火”别有用心
    强调只有停止侵略战争才能真正停止战火
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】我国出席联合国安全理事会代表伍修权、顾问乔冠华等一行九人已于十九日离美。行前伍修权曾向报界发表下列声明：
    “我们祝贺美国人民圣诞节快乐，新年愉快。我们是为了和平、为了恢复远东的和平而来到这里的。我们向联合国安全理事会提出了阻止远东战争继续进行与扩大的提案。那是一个制止战争的提案。我们认为：只有努力求得制止战争，才能真正停止战火。任何违背这个程序的计策都不过是诡计和阴谋而已。
    虽然我们制止战争的和平提案被英美统治集团未予应有的考虑即加以拒绝，可是我们并不失望。我们将为和平而继续奋斗。中国人民与美国人民一向有深厚的友谊。我们相信：没有一个爱好和平的美国人是赞同侵略台湾和干涉朝鲜的。我们也相信，没有一个爱好和平的美国人是愿意因侵略台湾和干涉朝鲜而造成世界大战的。全世界的人民，连同美国人民在内，都在热烈地要求和平，反对战争。我们相信：如果全世界爱好和平的人民紧密地团结起来，冷静地分清是非，辨明真伪，不为少数战争冒险家、坚持侵略的战争贩子所欺骗，也不为他们所吓倒，而是坚决地为维护真理而奋斗，就一定能够制止和防止战争。中国人民将与美国一切爱好和平的人民共同奋斗。”
    到机场欢送我国代表团者有苏联代表马立克、波兰代表卡茨·苏琪、捷克斯洛伐克代表诺雪葛，还有联合国秘书处的人员。
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】我国出席联合国安全理事会讨论控诉美国侵略台湾案会议的特派代表伍修权、顾问乔冠华等一行九人于二十日下午飞抵伦敦。伍修权曾在机场上对记者发表谈话，全文如下：各位记者先生：
    为了制止美国侵略和恢复远东和平，我们向联合国安全理事会提议美国政府从台湾撤出它的武装力量、停止干涉朝鲜，撤出美国和其他一切外国军队、朝鲜问题由朝鲜人民自己解决的方案，作为和平解决远东问题的基础。这是一个真正停止战争的方案。但联合国安全理事会在美国统治集团操纵之下，不加考虑地拒绝了我们的和平方案。美国军事冒险家别有用心地支持在朝鲜“首先停火”的主张，企图借以欺骗全世界人民，但是谁都知道，只有努力停止战争才可以真正停止战火。美国军事冒险家们所支持的所谓“首先停火”的真正目的，只是为了束缚朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的手足，让美国军队继续侵略和扩大战争。蒋介石在马歇尔将军帮助之下曾经对中国人民摆布过同样的圈套，中国人民对此不是没有经验的，我们愿意向全世界爱好和平的人民揭穿这个欺骗。
    美国少数统治集团这样做，并不是出乎我们的意料。他们执拗地拒绝承认中华人民共和国的存在，抹煞它对所有和中国有关系的远东问题的发言权和代表权。他们横蛮地干涉中国内政，死硬地支持蒋介石反动残余集团，公开地侵略中国，他们决心与全中国四万七千五百万人民为敌。全世界人民都已看到美国这个反动的侵略政策正在破产。但是为了继续这个破产的政策，美国统治集团正在猛烈地准备把全世界、东亚和西欧一起推向战争的深渊。杜鲁门总统公开声明考虑在东方使用原子弹，美国政府在全国宣布紧急状态，对中华人民共和国施行海上封锁和经济制裁，在欧洲则肆无忌惮地恢复西德的纳粹军事力量。由于美国统治集团这种侵略政策与战争政策的结果，全世界正面对着一个巨大的战争的威胁。但是，全世界人民是反对战争的。我们相信只要全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，辨别是非，坚持真理，努力奋斗，美国统治集团所疯狂推行的战争政策是可以打败的。
    中国人民热爱和平，热烈希望能在不受侵略和侵略的威胁的状况下和平建设自己的国家。中国政府一向主张用和平方法解决当前世界的各种重大问题，首先是和平解决由于美国统治集团武装侵略台湾和朝鲜所引起的远东问题。这一次联合国安全理事会虽然在美国统治集团的操纵之下拒绝我们和平解决远东问题的基本方案，我们仍将尽一切努力争取远东问题的和平解决，并愿意设法劝告中国人民志愿部队早日结束他们被迫和朝鲜人民军一道进行的反抗美国武装侵略的军事行动。
    最后我愿意乘此向爱好和平的英国人民致敬。
