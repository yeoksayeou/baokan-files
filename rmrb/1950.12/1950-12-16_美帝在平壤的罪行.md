    U.S. Imperialist Crimes in Pyongyang
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th] TASS Moscow, December 13th: *Pravda* published a dispatch from its reporter, Kornilov, from the liberated Pyongyang, stating: Today's Pyongyang is evidence of the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. and British interventionists and their lackey, Syngman Rhee, in Korea under the banner of the United Nations. Anyone who has been to Pyongyang cannot help but admire the beautiful opera house, the People's Assembly building nestled in greenery, and the exhibition rooms of the Palace of Culture. But now, none of these buildings exist. Hours before the American bandits retreated from the city, these buildings were burned to the ground. To completely paralyze life in the city, the Americans and Syngman Rhee, those demons, destroyed power lines, transformer stations, and blew up reservoirs and sluices, and destroyed water pipes. Even today, Pyongyang can still be said to be a city with smoldering embers.
    Kornilov continued: During the six weeks of rule by the American interventionists, the terror suffered by the residents of Pyongyang was utterly unimaginable. On the streets, one could encounter people with their hands tied at any time. These people had recently been released from prison. They had been subjected to terrible torture. During interrogations, the American executioners placed red-hot iron bracelets on the arms or shins of every detainee, and would not remove them until the bracelets had cooled down. The burns were not treated, and hundreds and thousands of people died of blood poisoning. The American demons carried out large-scale, insane massacres in Pyongyang. The roads around Pyongyang were littered with the bodies of women and children. The reporter quoted a postal clerk named Park about the massacre of Pyongyang residents when the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were about to enter the city. Park said: On the morning of December 5th, the American authorities ordered all residents to leave the city, and those who did not would be shot. So women carrying children, old people with belongings, and young people with luggage walked towards a concrete bridge. After a few hours, the bridge was crowded, making it impossible to move. When the last batch of people being escorted arrived, the bridge was blown up, burying tens of thousands of Pyongyang residents under the broken bridge. Those who were lucky enough to escape death were shot on the spot by American soldiers.
    However, despite the terror and brutal persecution suffered by the people of Pyongyang, their struggle never stopped for a minute. Munitions depots were blown up, American officers were killed by accurate bullets from vengeful people, and cars were set on fire. In early November, the bandits had planned to hold a banquet to welcome Syngman Rhee's arrival in Pyongyang. But the celebration did not take place. Half an hour before the banquet began, a mine planted by the guerrillas exploded in the hall. This traitor to the Korean people quickly left Pyongyang.
    The People's Army, with the participation of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, is continuing its victorious offensive. Pyongyang has become the rear. Pyongyang, which has suffered, is scarred, but has never been conquered, has been revived and is recovering. Retreating agencies and organizations have begun to return. Construction teams are working day and night, repairing water pipes, power lines, and sewers. Shops have begun to open, and newspapers have begun to be published.

### 美帝在平壤的罪行

    美帝在平壤的罪行
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：真理报发表该报记者科尔尼洛夫从解放了的平壤发来的通讯称：今天的平壤，正是美英干涉者及其走狗李承晚在联合国的旗帜之下在朝鲜所犯的滔天罪行的证据。凡是到过平壤的人，都不能不赞美那美丽的歌剧院，那掩映在一片青绿中的人民议会的建筑物，都不能不去看看文化宫的展览室。但是现在，这些建筑物没有一处存在了。在美国匪帮自该城撤退的数小时以前，这些建筑物都被一烧而光。为了要使全城的生活完全麻痹，美国人和李承晚这些恶魔们破坏了电线、变压所，炸毁了水池、水闸，破坏了自来水管。一直到今天，平壤还可以说是一座余火未熄的城。   科尔尼洛夫继称：在美国干涉者统治之下的六周中，平壤居民所受的恐怖是完全难以想象的。在街上，人们随时可以遇到两手被绑的人。这些人最近已从狱中出来。他们受过可怕的酷刑。在审讯时，美国刽子手们把烧得灼热的铁镯套在每一个被捕者的手臂或腿胫上，不到铁镯已经凉了的时候是不拿下来的。烧伤的地方也不治疗，于是成百成千的人民都死于血液中毒。美国的恶魔们在平壤实行了大规模的疯狂屠杀。平壤周围的道路上，妇女和儿童的尸体横陈。记者引了一个姓朴的邮局事务员所说的在人民军和中国志愿军快要进城时平壤居民被杀害的情形。朴说：十二月五日早晨，美国当局下令所有居民离城，不离城的就要被枪毙。于是女人背着小孩，老年人带着杂物，青年人带着行李，向一个水泥做的桥走去。几小时以后桥上挤满了人，弄得寸步难移。等到最后一批被押送来的人到达时，桥被炸毁了，于是成千上万的平壤居民就被埋到碎桥下面，幸而免死的也被美国士兵就地枪毙。
    但是，尽管平壤人民遭受恐怖和残酷的迫害，他们的斗争一分钟也没有停过。军火仓库被炸毁，美国军官被复仇的人民准确的枪弹打死，汽车着了火。十一月初，匪徒们本来准备举行宴会欢迎李承晚到达平壤。但是庆祝会没有举行。在宴会开始以前半小时，游击队在大厅里布的地雷爆炸了。这个朝鲜人民的卖国贼很快就离开了平壤。
    有着英勇作战的中国人民志愿军参加的人民军，正在继续进行胜利的攻势。平壤已经成为后方了。遭受苦难、满身伤痕、但是始终未被征服的平壤，已经苏生，并且正在恢复元气。撤退的机关和团体已开始回来。修建队不分昼夜地工作着，修理自来水管、电线和下水道。商店已开始营业，报纸已开始出版。
