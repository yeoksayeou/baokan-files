    Launch Patriotic Production Emulation Drive
    Shanxi Peasants Respond to Li Shunda and Zhang Zhiquan's Challenge
    [Our Newspaper] Peasants in various parts of Shanxi Province are actively responding to the patriotic production emulation challenge issued by agricultural model workers Li Shunda and Zhang Zhiquan. The challenge letter proposed by Li Shunda and Zhang Zhiquan in mid-November was first responded to in Ping順 County (Li Shunda's hometown). On November 24th, the Ping順 County "Winter Production" tabloid published the full text of Li Shunda's challenge to all farmers in the province, along with news of the enthusiastic response to the challenge from all the farmers in Liujia Village in the first district, nine mutual aid groups including Guo Yu'en's group in Chuandi Village, and farmers in Yangfengshan mutual aid group in Panjiao Village in the sixth district. After discussing the terms of the challenge from Li Shunda's group, the farmers of three groups including Wang Jitang's group in Baitan Village unanimously proposed: "Humbly learn from Li Shunda and bravely accept the challenge from Li Shunda." They focused on doing a good job in winter production and making all preparations for next year's major production as the main content of the challenge; the specific conditions are: 1. This winter, improve three wide-ridge seeders, transform six iron-wheeled plows and one human-pulled hoe, and prepare enough other agricultural tools; 2. Build and improve 9.8 mu of soil, convert 4.3 mu of slopes into flat land, repair 0.3 mu of river beach, and plant 13 mu of Codonopsis pilosula; 3. Develop fertilizer sources and accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, striving to apply 110 dan of fertilizer per mu; 4. Reinforce 80% of the collapsed banks this year; 5. Collect firewood and transport coal, accumulating enough fuel for eight months; 6. Earn 31 shi and 1 dou of rice by running transportation and blacksmithing; 7. This winter or next spring, buy one mule, thirty sheep, build thirteen houses, and repair seven houses and twelve cave dwellings. The Party branch of Juzhai Village in Changzhi County, leading the masses of the whole village, wrote in their letter of acceptance to Li Shunda and Zhang Zhiquan: We have seen your letter of challenge and after enthusiastic discussion, we have also formulated a plan combining winter production and learning, as the terms for our challenge to you. In addition to specifically explaining the conditions for accumulating fertilizer, sideline production, and protecting forests in the letter of acceptance, it also proposes strengthening winter defense work, always being vigilant against the sabotage activities of bandits and special agents, and resolutely defending the safe production of the masses. Liu Xin mutual aid group in Shangleping Village, Huoxian County, put forward ten terms for accepting the challenge and immediately took action. Liu Baocheng and Han Heshang, representatives from Jincheng attending the Provincial Model Workers Conference, also actively responded to the challenge of Li Shunda and Zhang Zhiquan's mutual aid group on behalf of all the farmers in their groups. In their letter of acceptance, they said: "We must humbly learn from the elder brother, and we must do a good job in next year's production so that all the people in the village can live a life of abundance." Finally, they said: "If we fail to meet the five conditions we have put forward, we are willing to lose two pennants!"
