Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen University in Beijing, rebuked Austin, saying: "Our Fu Jen University was originally run by the church and was one of the cultural aggressions stipulated in the unequal treaties signed by American imperialism and the reactionary Chinese government. The facts of American imperialism's aggression through the church at Fu Jen University are still clearly in our minds. American imperialism controlled the school's administration, monopolized the school's economy, and persecuted and coerced progressive professors and students. Today, all of our teachers, students, and staff have fully recognized the cunning face of American imperialism. We can no longer be oppressed and bullied by it, and we will not allow it to continue its cultural aggression. We have united to fight against the aggressive forces of American imperialism, and we have already achieved victory. Not only today, but also in the future, we will always stand firmly at the forefront of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and fight American imperialist acts of aggression to the end." Professor Zhang Huai said, "American imperialism runs education in China to train a group of Chinese people to be used by them in order to achieve their goal of 'using Chinese to rule Chinese'." Secretary-General Zhang Chongyi said: "All the faculty, staff, and students of our Fu Jen University, because they hate American cultural aggression, have already driven out the forces of imperialism. People in the American government must know this, but Austin still shamelessly uses our Chinese people's Fu Jen University to embellish his hypocritical 'historical facts' of 'Sino-American people's friendship.' This is no different from the shameless trick of the reactionary American newspapers fabricating photos of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and reversing right and wrong as reported in the People's Daily on the 6th of this month. We should expose his conspiracy." In a declaration issued by all the teachers and students of the school, they stated: "Tell Austin, the representative of the American warmongers, tell American imperialism, don't be so sickening and delusional anymore. The awakened Chinese people cannot be intimidated or deceived! Imperialism still wants to use its consistent method of anesthetizing aggression as 'friendship.' The Chinese people have had enough of this kind of 'friendship'! We believe that true friendship only exists between the Chinese people and the American people, while there is only the struggle of aggression and anti-aggression between American imperialism and the Chinese people. There is no friendship whatsoever. Austin, watch out! The newborn Fu Jen University, the Chinese people's Fu Jen University, will, under the leadership of the People's Government, cultivate thousands upon thousands of cadres for the construction and defense of the new China. We will use practical actions—Resist America, Aid Korea, and defend our homes and country—to answer your 'friendship'!" (Fu Jen University Correspondent Group)

    辅大全体师生答复美国强盗
    中国人民是吓不倒的
    北京辅仁大学陈垣校长斥责奥斯汀说：“我们辅仁大学原来是教会办的，是美帝与中国反动政府订的不平等条约所规定的文化侵略之一种。美帝通过教会，在辅仁大学的侵略事实，还明显的留在我们的脑里。美帝曾把持了学校的行政，垄断了学校的经济，迫害威逼进步的教授和学生，今天我们全校教职学工，已经完全认清美帝的狡猾面貌，我们不能再受他的压迫和欺侮，不许他再继续作文化上的侵略。我们已团结起来，与美帝的侵略势力作斗争，而且我们已得到了胜利。我们不但是今天，而且在明天，永远坚决地站在抗美援朝运动的最前线，与美帝侵略行为斗争到底。”张怀教授说：“美帝在中国办教育是为了教出一班中国人来被他们所用，以达他们‘以华治华’的目的”。张重一秘书长说：我们辅仁大学全体教职员学工因痛恨美帝的文化侵略，已经驱逐了帝国主义的势力，在美政府里的人们是一定知道的，而奥斯汀却仍无耻地以我们中国人民的辅仁大学来粉饰他那虚伪的“中美人民友谊”的“史实”，这与本月六日人民日报所载美国反动报纸伪造中国人民解放军的照片，颠倒是非的无耻伎俩是无二致的，我们应该揭穿他的阴谋。该校全体师生在发表的宣言中称：告诉美国战争贩子的代表奥斯汀，告诉美国帝国主义，不要再肉麻再幻想了，觉醒了的中国人民，是吓不倒的，欺骗不了的！帝国主义还想以一贯的麻醉侵略的方式当“友谊”，这样的“友谊”中国人民已经尝够了！我们认为真正的友谊只存在于中国人民和美国人民之间，而美帝国主义与中国人民之间只有侵略与反侵略的斗争，没有丝毫的友谊可言。奥斯汀，看着吧！新生的辅仁大学，中国人民的辅仁大学将会在人民政府的领导下，培养出成千成万的建设与保卫新中国的干部，我们将以实际的行动——抗美援朝保家卫国——来回答你们的“友谊”！（辅大通讯组）
