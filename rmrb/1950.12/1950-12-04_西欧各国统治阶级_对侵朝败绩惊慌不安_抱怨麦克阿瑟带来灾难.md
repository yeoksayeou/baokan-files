Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: European news reports indicate that the bankruptcy of the American invading army's so-called "general offensive," with its ambition to seize all of Korea, has triggered serious alarm and recrimination within the ruling classes of Western European capitalist countries that follow American imperialism.

In Britain, most newspapers used words like dangerous, foolish, and disastrous to denounce MacArthur. The Liberal Party's *Manchester Guardian* complained, "General MacArthur's offensive was wrong, and it has brought disaster." Another Liberal newspaper, the *News Chronicle*, as early as November 25th, criticized MacArthur's offensive, which boasted of annihilating Korea before Christmas, as "a major historical folly." The *New Statesman and Nation* magazine attacked MacArthur as an "autocratic military politician." The *Irish Times* compared MacArthur to "an old man who apparently sees himself as a modern Napoleon" and advocated "his replacement."

The Paris *Le Figaro* in France used the large headline: "MacArthur's offensive is the worst thing he could have done for the United Nations." The newspaper said: "To give MacArthur what appears to be a blank check that he seems to be asking for would be, at the very least, a reckless thing."

Several newspapers in smaller Western European countries ridiculed MacArthur's talent. The Copenhagen *Politiken* in Denmark said: "MacArthur's political skills have been demonstrated by his visit to Chiang Kai-shek, his partisan political support for Syngman Rhee, and his recent offensive towards the Manchurian border." The West German *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* said: "The trouble is that MacArthur, for several years, has apparently seen himself not only as a general, but also as a politician." The Swedish Liberal Party's *Expressen* also criticized MacArthur, saying that he had "once again shown his astonishing lack of judgment."

    抱怨麦克阿瑟带来灾难
    【新华社三日讯】欧洲消息报道，美国侵略军妄想侵占全部朝鲜的所谓“总攻势”的破产，已引起追随美帝国主义的西欧资本主义各国统治阶级内部严重的惊慌和指责。
    在英国，大多数报纸均以危险、愚蠢和灾难等一类字眼，斥责麦克阿瑟。自由党的《曼彻斯特卫报》报怨说：“麦克阿瑟将军的攻势是错误的，它已经带来了灾难。”另一个自由党的报纸《新闻纪事报》，早在十一月二十五日，就批评麦克阿瑟扬言圣诞节前灭亡朝鲜的攻势，是“历史上一大愚蠢事件”。《新政治家与民族》杂志攻击麦克阿瑟是一个“专横的军事政客”。爱尔兰泰晤士报把麦克阿瑟比成“一个显然以现代拿破仑自命的老头子”，主张“应予撤换”。
    法国巴黎的《费加罗报》用了这样的大字标题：“麦克阿瑟的攻势是他所能为联合国作的事情中最糟的一件”。该报说：“如果发给麦克阿瑟以他似乎在要求的一张空白支票，那么这至少会是一件莽撞的事情。”
    若干西欧小国的报纸讥诮麦克阿瑟的才能。丹麦哥本哈根的《新闻报》说：“麦克阿瑟的政治手腕，已由他访问蒋介石，偏袒地在政治上支持李承晚以及最近向满洲边界发动进攻等事表现出来了。”西德的《法兰克福环球报》说：“麻烦的是，麦克阿瑟几年以来，显然不仅自命为一位将军，而且自命为一位政治家。”瑞典自由党的《快报》也责难说：麦克阿瑟已经“再度表明了他缺乏判断力，简直令人吃惊。”
