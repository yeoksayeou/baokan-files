    [This newspaper dispatch] Tianjin youth students and youth workers are enthusiastically enrolling in various military cadre schools. According to preliminary statistics, over 3,500 young workers and students in the city have signed up. Forty-six young workers from the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill have already enrolled. Worker Chen Yunxiang and his wife, Su Xiuzhen, encouraged each other and signed up together. Many students volunteering to participate in the construction of national defense have received encouragement from their parents and teachers. Ji Tao, a professor at Nankai University, encouraged his three children to join military cadre schools. He wrote to his two sons studying at Harbin Institute of Technology, saying: "To be a people's engineer, a secure motherland is indispensable. Today, the flames of war have reached our country's borders. I hope you will exchange your pens for swords, resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country." Both of his sons enrolled in military schools in Harbin. His daughter, who is studying at Yaohua Middle School in Tianjin, was also encouraged by him to enroll in a military school.
