Soviet Experts Demonstrate Soviet Machine Tool Operation Method in Shenyang
Making Great Contributions to the Improvement of Our Country's Master Machine Operation Method

[This newspaper's dispatch] Soviet working machine tool experts solemnly demonstrated the Soviet machine tool operation method at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Factory on November 13th. Approximately 200 people attended and learned, including outstanding machine tool workers, technicians, and engineers from the machinery, military industry, Fushun, and coal mine bureaus, as well as mechanical factories belonging to companies such as Anshan, Benxi, and Jianxin. The demonstration lasted for three consecutive days.

Prior to this, the workers had insufficient understanding of the superior performance and advanced operation methods of Soviet machine tools. After this demonstration by Soviet experts, the attendees gained a full understanding of the superior performance and advanced operation methods of Soviet machine tools. The records of the demonstration greatly surprised every attendee. It took Chinese workers more than an hour to machine a slanting rod of a tip on a Soviet lathe; the Soviet expert only needed one minute and fifty-five seconds during the demonstration. The depth of cut during the demonstration was 66% higher (for machining the tip) to 400% higher (for machining the turret gear) than the depth of cut Chinese workers previously used during regular operation. The increase in labor productivity ranged from four times (milling helical gears, using ordinary high-speed steel tools) to 31.2 times (machining the tip, using cemented carbide tools). Some processes required three steps by Chinese workers, while during the demonstration, two or three processes were sometimes completed in one step.

The demonstrating Soviet experts were all engineers. Brosgulin was also the designer of the hexagonal lathe. His proficiency in operation was stronger than even outstanding veteran skilled workers. The Chinese technicians who came to observe praised this as a concrete manifestation of the unity of theory and practice.

On the afternoon of the 16th, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government specially convened a summary meeting. Lu Dong, Deputy Minister of the Industry Department, pointed out in his summary: This demonstration has great significance in the Northeast industrial sector. The "high-speed cutting method" is a technically fundamental reform for the machinery manufacturing industry, just as the mechanization of coal mining was implemented in the coal mining enterprises this spring. Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech: At this moment when our entire Northeast is launching a patriotic production competition movement, the Soviet experts have come to help us concretely, which is of great significance; it will enable our production competition to achieve greater success. He said: On the one hand, we must organize the production competition well, and on the other hand, we must also organize the learning of technology well, especially the learning of advanced Soviet technology, to solve the various problems we encounter in production. The various units participating in the conference presented flowers and flags to the Soviet experts as a sign of respect for their sincere assistance.

In order to improve the efficiency of machine tools in the machinery manufacturing industry, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government issued a decision on November 25th, instructing various mechanical departments to learn from advanced Soviet experience and promote the "high-speed cutting method" with emphasis, planning, and steps.

    苏联专家在沈表演苏联机床操作法
    对我国改进母机操作法贡献巨大
    【本报讯】苏联工作母机专家于十一月十三日在沈阳第三机器厂隆重表演苏联机床操作法。参观与学习的约二百人，包括机械、军工、抚顺、煤矿等管理局及鞍山、本溪、建新等公司所属各机械厂的优秀机床工人、技术人员、工程师等。表演连续进行三天。
    在此以前，工友们对苏联机床的优越性能及先进操作方法认识不足。经过这次苏联专家的表演，参观者对苏联机床的优越性能及先进的操作方法有了充分的认识。表演的纪录使每一个参观者都大为吃惊。苏联车床在中国工人车一个顶尖的斜杆要一小时多；苏联专家表演时只需一分五十五秒。表演中吃刀的深度比中国工人以前经常操作时的吃刀深度高出百分之六十六（车顶尖）到百分之四百（车塔齿轮）；劳动生产率的提高从四倍（铣斜牙轮，用普通高速钢刀具）到三十一点二倍（车顶尖，用硬质合金刀具）。有的工序中国工人需花三道手续，表演时有时一次有完成两三个工序。
    表演的苏联专家都是工程师。布罗斯古林且是六角车床的设计者。他在操作时的熟练程度，比优秀的老技工都强。来参观的中国技术人员，盛赞着这是理论与实践一致的具体表现。
    十六日下午，东北人民政府工业部特召开总结大会。工业部吕东副部长在总结中指出：这次表演在东北工业部门有重大意义。“高速度切削法”对于机械制造工业部门，有如今春在煤矿企业部门实行机械化采煤法一样，是在技术上带有根本意义的改革。东北总工会张维桢主席在发言中指出：正当我全东北展开爱国主义生产竞赛运动的今天，苏联专家前来具体帮助我们，是有着重大的意义；它将使我们的生产竞赛获得更大的成就。他说：我们一方面要很好地组织生产竞赛，一方面也要很好地组织学习技术，尤其是学习苏联先进技术，以解决我们在生产中所碰到的各种问题。参加大会的各单位纷纷向苏联专家献花献旗，作为对他们赤诚相助的敬意。
    东北人民政府工业部为在机器制造业中提高机床效能，于十一月二十五日发出决定，指示各机械部门，应学习苏联先进经验，有重点有计划有步骤地推广“高速切削法”。
