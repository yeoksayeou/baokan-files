    Unhealthy Elements in Movie Advertisements
    To the Editor:
    Regarding the problem of vulgar language in movie advertisements, I originally intended to collect advertising materials from newspapers across the country to make a comprehensive suggestion. This work was only half completed when I went to the Guilin Prefectural Land Reform Cadre Training Class to study, and I no longer have time to do this work. However, according to the materials I have collected, many publicly owned newspapers have not paid attention to this blind spot (among those I have reviewed, only the Beijing People's Daily and Xi'an Masses Daily do not have this phenomenon). For example, the advertisement for "Qing Deng Yuan" published in the Yangtze Daily on September 16th reads, "Two hearts united, the flame of love rages, earning people's tears, touching people's hearts"; the advertisement for "Female Tycoon" published in the Zhejiang Daily on September 8th reads, "Ambitious and vigorous, the female tycoon controls the universe! Commanding the wind and calling the rain, frustrated in love, the tigress's heart is desolate, the moon is cold and the flowers fall." It is even more prevalent in non-publicly owned newspapers, such as the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao. The advertisements for "World of Lies" published in the first half of September varied daily, "Brilliant and dazzling, dazzlingly beautiful," "A flirtatious look in her eyes, a smile on her lips, using all her charm to exchange for gold and dollars," "One is: a doting husband indulging in pleasure, the other is a modest girl, selling her charms and flirting," "Li Lihua uses all her skills, enchanting and coquettish," "New type of romantic comedy" (each parenthesis indicates one day). What is the difference between these and the boring movie advertisements before liberation? How can these rotten, vulgar, and feudal dregs that insult women not be swept out of the people's newspapers?
    Now I don't have time to continue this work. Please suggest to newspaper offices in various regions to pay attention to and correct these phenomena, and let these "rotten, vulgar, and feudal dregs that insult women" be swept out of the people's newspapers nationwide.
                                Sincerely,
                                                Chen Mo
    Editor's Note: The issue raised by Comrade Chen Mo is a noteworthy one. The unhealthy promotion in some movie advertisements has indeed aroused the aversion of many people.
    Originally, movie advertisements could just print a few lines to tell readers what movie is playing and where, which would be enough. There should be better ways to promote movies. Movie reviews and movie stories published in newspapers, and comic strips adapted from movies, are all good ways to promote movies. We don't need to copy the kind of loud and exaggerated advertising promotion used in capitalist countries.
    At present, because many theater owners and many moviegoers are still accustomed to this large-scale movie advertisement promotion method, especially in some large cities, it will take a relatively long time to change this habit. However, those unhealthy promotions should be eliminated. Movies are a form of entertainment and an educational weapon, and should not have unhealthy elements, nor should they use unhealthy methods to attract audiences. When newspapers publish such unhealthy promotions, they are also helping to spread bad tendencies, and cannot say that they are not responsible simply because it is an advertisement.
    Moreover, the actual effectiveness of that unhealthy promotion is also questionable, because there are fewer and fewer moviegoers who are easily attracted by that unhealthy promotion. If film distributors and theater owners still want to desperately cling to these backward audiences, and do not make efforts to deliver movies to the broad masses of the people, then they are bound to fail from a business perspective alone. Newspaper advertising workers should be good at using these facts to persuade movie advertisement clients to eliminate unhealthy elements from advertisements.

    电影广告中的不健康成分
    编辑同志：
    关于电影广告低级用语问题，本来我是打算搜集全国各报的广告材料，作一个全面的建议，这工作只进行了一半，便到桂林专署土改干部训练班学习，已没有时间来做这工作了。但据我搜集得材料，许多公营的报纸对这死角并没有引起注意（我翻阅过的只北京人民日报、西安群众日报没有这现象），像九月十六日长江日报载的“青灯怨”广告，是“两心相印，情焰燎原，赚人热泪，动人心弦”；九月八日浙江日报载之“女大亨”广告是“雄心勃发，女大亨腕底乾坤！呼风唤雨，情场失意，雌老虎心头凄凉，月冷花落”。在非公营的报纸上就更加普遍一些，如上海的大公报，在九月上半月所刊的“说谎世界”的广告，就天天花样不同，“灿烂辉煌，艳光逼人”，“眼角挂俏，嘴边带笑，且把一身娇俏，去换取黄金美钞”“一个是：娇妻入抱混混陶陶，一个是小家碧玉，卖情弄俏”“李丽华混身解数，妖冶风骚”“新型风流大喜剧”（一个括弧表示一天），这些和未解放前那些无聊的电影广告有什么不同呢？这些腐臭的，低级的，侮辱女性的封建渣滓，怎么还不从人民的报纸上扫出去呢？
    现在我没有时间再弄这工作，请你们把这些现象，建议各地报馆注意及纠正，让这些“腐臭的、低级的、侮辱女性的封建渣滓”从全国的人民报纸上扫出去。
                                此致敬礼
                                                陈默
    编者按：陈默同志所提出的问题，是一个值得注意的问题。电影广告上的一些不健康的宣传确已引起许多人的厌恶了。
    本来，电影广告可以只登几行，告诉读者那里在演什么片子就够了，电影的宣传应该有一些更好的方法。刊载在报纸上的电影评介、电影故事，用影片编成的连坏画，都是很好的宣传电影的方式。我们用不着袭用资本主义国家的那种大吹大擂暄染夸张的广告宣传。
    在目前，由于许多影院商和许多电影观众还习惯于这种大幅电影广告的宣传方式，尤其是在若干大城市中，须要较长的时间才能转变这种习惯。但是那些不健康的宣传却是应该清除的。电影是一种娱乐的和教育的武器，不应该有不健康的成分，也不应该用不健康的方法吸引观众。报纸上发表了那种不健康的宣传，也是帮助传布了坏的倾向，不能说那是广告便可以不负责。
    而且，那种不健康的宣传的实际效力也是可怀疑的，因为容易为那种不健康的宣传所吸引的电影观众是愈来愈少了。影片商和影院商如果还想拚命抓住这些落后的观众，而不努力把电影交给广大的人民群众，那仅从营业上说也是一定要失败的。报纸的广告工作者应该善于用这些事实说服电影广告刊户，肃清广告中的不健康的成分。
