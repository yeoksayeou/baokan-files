Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 30 (TASS dispatch): Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee meeting on November 27 regarding the United States' aggression against China. The full text is as follows:

    The delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics requests the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the question of the aggression of the United States of America against the People's Republic of China.

    The United States Illegally Occupies Taiwan and its Territorial Waters, Brutally Trampling on the Standards and Principles of International Law

    As everyone knows, on June 27, 1950, the U.S. President formally issued an order to the U.S. Seventh Fleet to take violent action against China's Taiwan Island under the guise of "preventing any attack on Taiwan." As everyone knows, the U.S. Navy, in carrying out this order, has sailed to the coast of Taiwan, imposing a naval blockade on the island and patrolling the Taiwan Strait. Since then, the ports of Taiwan have become bases for the U.S. Navy. And soon after, as reported by newspapers in the United States and around the world, several U.S. Air Force units, along with their personnel, were transferred to Taiwan. Taiwan is also stationed with a so-called "liaison group" from MacArthur's headquarters, which, according to newspaper reports, was later reorganized into the "U.S. Far East Command Taiwan Survey Group."

    In this way, the U.S. military has brutally trampled on all the standards and principles of international law by illegally occupying Taiwan Island and its territorial waters, and stationing itself in the Taiwan area as if in a conquered territory, on this Chinese island.

    Moreover, everyone knows that Taiwan has always been Chinese territory, an inseparable part of China. This is quite obvious from the following facts: Taiwan has belonged to China for many centuries; in terms of the ethnic composition of the island's inhabitants, according to recent statistics, 98 percent are Chinese; and finally, there are several international agreements concluded during the Second World War. The Soviet delegation has drawn the attention of the Political Committee to the Cairo and Potsdam international agreements regarding Taiwan, agreements regarding the return of Taiwan to China; these agreements were signed by the U.S. government.

    The U.S. authorities and their allies often use the Japanese name for Taiwan, calling Taiwan Formosa. Although this is not a Japanese island, but a Chinese island that was once occupied by the Japanese and is now occupied by the Americans. Therefore, I will say Taiwan everywhere, and not Formosa, because Taiwan is its national name, and no one has the right to destroy this tradition.

    We have also drawn attention to the statements made by U.S. President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson in January of this year, in which they referred to the international obligations undertaken by the United States under the Cairo and Potsdam agreements regarding the return of Taiwan to China and the obligation of the island to be included within Chinese territory and become an inseparable part thereof. In the aforementioned statements, Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson declared that the United States would not interfere in the affairs of Taiwan, and generally speaking, would not interfere in China's internal affairs. The U.S. State Department also referred to this in a formal statement on February 9, 1950, and here I would also like to remind the Political Committee of the full text of this statement.

    The statement reads: "The President's statement of January 5, 1950, is the reaffirmation by the United States of America of the Cairo Declaration regarding the settlement of the Taiwan (referred to as Formosa in the statement) issue. Since 1945, Taiwan (referred to as Formosa in the statement) has been administered by China. ...It has been included within China, becoming a province. ...The Allied nations participating in the war against Japan have no doubt about these steps. The United States has no doubt about these steps either. Because these steps are fully in accordance with the agreement reached in Cairo and confirmed in Potsdam. In other words – the statement says – the Allied nations, including the United States, have considered Formosa (i.e., Taiwan) to be a part of China for the past four years, and if the U.S. government currently intends to establish a non-Chinese administrative authority in Formosa (Taiwan) as a result of a plebiscite held under the supervision of the Supreme Commander and the Allied occupation forces, the United Nations Organization, or the Far Eastern Commission, this would be considered by almost everyone in mainland China and throughout Asia as a violation of our obligations by our government and a contradiction to our policy of always respecting China's territorial integrity, attempting to separate Formosa (Taiwan) from China."

    Therefore, we can see: at least from the authoritative explanation given by the leader of U.S. foreign policy – the Secretary of State – regarding President Truman's statement, it can be clearly concluded that there are three situations: (1) there is no doubt that Taiwan belongs to China and is an inseparable part of Chinese territory; (2) actions of the kind referred to here must not be allowed, because this would be considered by everyone to be a violation of the obligations solemnly undertaken by the United States itself, that is, the obligations undertaken in Cairo and Potsdam, in either the Cairo or Potsdam agreements would be violated; (3) it is acknowledged that attempting to establish an administrative authority in Taiwan under the supervision of the occupying forces or the United Nations Organization, and not under the supervision of the Chinese government, means attempting to separate Taiwan from China, which would violate the aforementioned obligations. This was the position taken by the United States towards the Taiwan issue in early 1950.

    However, the U.S. government, regardless of these and other statements, has brutally violated its obligations to Taiwan under the Cairo and Potsdam agreements, seized Taiwan, and sent troops to occupy it, thereby undermining China's territorial integrity and arrogantly trampling on the basic standards of international law and the principles of the United Nations Charter.

    I should cite Article 2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that all members of the United Nations "shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or nation, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations."

    The order issued by the U.S. President on June 27 of this year provides for the direct use of force against Taiwan. Is it not clear that the U.S. government, with these illegal actions, has violated the United Nations Charter in the most intolerable way? Is it not clear that the U.S. government treats the principles of respecting the territorial integrity and political independence of all countries, as stipulated in the United Nations Charter, with a policy of violence, and acts arrogantly in international relations?

    The statement made by Truman when issuing the order to the U.S. Seventh Fleet, as well as the subsequent actions of the U.S. armed forces against Taiwan, have proved that the U.S. government, in its relations with China, has embarked on the path of implementing a policy of force in the most brutal manner – armed manner – as I have said.

    The United States Includes the So-called "Formosa Question" on the Agenda

    Intending to Use the United Nations to Cover Up its Actions of Aggression Against Taiwan

    Currently, as indicated by the discussions of the General Assembly's General Committee and the General Assembly plenary meeting on the question of including the so-called "Formosa question" on the General Assembly's agenda, the U.S. ruling clique intends to use the signboard of the United Nations, the banner of the United Nations, the name of the United Nations, to cover up their own actions of aggression against China's Taiwan Island, just as they did in Korea. This is to use the illegal resolutions of several Security Council members, forcibly claiming them to be Security Council resolutions, which we have long proven to have been passed through arrogant violations of the principles on which the United Nations Charter is based. In this case, how should we judge the behavior of a country that violates the territory and territorial waters of other sovereign countries with armed forces, imposes a blockade on the coast or part of the coast of that country, threatens the legitimate government with force, and at the same time interferes in the internal affairs of this sovereign country? The judgment of such behavior is unquestionable. There can only be one judgment for such behavior, and it is a completely definite one. This is obvious aggression. This is an act of aggression against China, the purpose of which is to support the bankrupt Nationalist Party group, which has been overthrown by the Chinese people, to carry out the struggle against the only legitimate Chinese government of the Chinese people – the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

    We believe that the assessment of this illegal act, this illegal act of the U.S. government against the government of the People's Republic of China, is completely fair in the statement made by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on June 28 of this year. This statement said: "Truman's statement on the 27th and the actions of the U.S. Navy are an armed aggression against Chinese territory and a thorough violation of the United Nations Charter."

    As everyone knows, the U.S. ruling clique's interference in China's internal affairs has a long history. This interference has been repeatedly carried out for a long time, and the illegal actions currently being carried out by the U.S. government against China's Taiwan Island are merely a new link in a long chain of various acts of interference by the U.S. ruling clique in providing military equipment to the reactionary Nationalist Party group and supporting the reactionary Nationalist Party group in its struggle against the Chinese people's national liberation movement (although, no matter what, it is hopeless and foolish to continue the struggle against this great people's movement for national liberation and unification of China).

    The United States Systematically Supplies the Nationalist Party with Weapons to Kill Thousands upon Thousands of Good Sons and Daughters of the Chinese People

    As everyone knows, for example, between 1946 and 1949 (I only cite the recent three years as examples, regardless of the 1950 that I have briefly mentioned), the U.S. government has allocated huge sums of money to militarily and economically assist Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary Nationalist Party group in its struggle against the democratic forces of China. Everyone also remembers that the U.S. State Department's "White Paper" admitted that this assistance amounted to more than three billion U.S. dollars. The U.S. government has in the past and continues to systematically supply the Nationalist Party's army with weapons, which have killed thousands upon thousands of good sons and daughters of the Chinese people over the course of five years.

    U.S. military advisors and instructors have in the past and continue to train and arm the Nationalist Party's army, and actively participate in the formulation of operational plans against the People's Liberation Army, that is, against the Chinese people. The U.S. Navy and Air Force have been and still are transporting large numbers of Nationalist Party troops to operational areas against the Chinese state and the Chinese people. However, despite all these efforts by the U.S. ruling clique, they have not been able to suppress that powerful movement, the Chinese people's national liberation movement, by relying on the Nationalist Party puppet regime. The anti-people Nationalist Party group has been driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people, and on Taiwan Island, it temporarily takes refuge under the protection of U.S. bayonets – under the protection of U.S. armed forces.

    The U.S. government's statement that the purpose of the U.S. armed forces is to prevent the People's Republic of China from entering Taiwan means that the U.S. government not only continues to interfere in China's civil war, but also openly uses its own military in this struggle. This matter itself fully proves the U.S. government's armed aggression against China, and proves that the Soviet Union's accusation against the U.S. ruling clique for such illegal acts of aggression is just.

    In order to achieve its own goals against China, the U.S. government takes all measures to strengthen cooperation with the anti-people Nationalist Party group.

    It should be reminded that as early as the beginning of August of this year, General MacArthur completed his trip to Taiwan, and, according to various reports, during his visit to Taiwan, arrangements were completed for effective cooperation, that is, the effective cooperation between the U.S. military under his command and the armed forces held by the Nationalist Party side, or as MacArthur called it, the "Chinese government" side. He comforted himself with such a fantasy that he was not dealing with the last dregs, with the last remnants of the old government that was doomed to eventually disappear from the pages of history, but was still dealing with some so-called "government." Everyone knows that after Chiang Kai-shek met with MacArthur, he declared that an agreement had been reached between him and "his old comrade-in-arms General MacArthur" (as he called MacArthur) on the issue of military cooperation in Taiwan.

    From this, it can be seen that although the U.S. ruling clique's policy of aggression against China has suffered a complete failure, and although this failure has been openly admitted in the formally published U.S. State Department's "White Paper," it has not yet abandoned the delusion of restoring the old rule in China by all means. To achieve this goal, it uses the remnants of the Nationalist Party reactionaries in Taiwan and uses its own armed forces.

    Taiwan's Sovereignty Belongs to the People's Republic of China, Truman's Reasons for Intervention Are False

    In order to support the enemies of the Chinese people, the U.S. ruling clique appears as the irreconcilable enemy of Chinese democracy, as the irreconcilable enemy of the Chinese people's national liberation movement, and does not hesitate to brutally undermine China's sovereignty, the sovereignty of the Chinese government, regardless of whether the United States recognizes the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China or not. The U.S. aggression against China pursues far-reaching goals. One of the goals is to avoid the Nationalist Party group being driven out of its last lair – Taiwan Island, and thereby maintain a possibility for the United States to use this island as a military base for further U.S. aggression against China and aggression against the Far East. A series of speeches by well-known U.S. politicians who are highly responsible and therefore express a clear official position on this issue convincingly demonstrate this U.S. ruling clique's scheme. As early as December 1949 and January of this year, some U.S. politicians, especially Senators Smith and Nolan, had proposed open intervention in China, proposing plans to occupy Taiwan and turn the island into a U.S. military base. All of this happened at the time and after the U.S. delegation at the Fourth United Nations General Assembly, on the one hand, instigated its Nationalist Party agents to make malicious slanders against the Soviet Union, while on the other hand, hypocritically stated that it was necessary to respect China's territorial integrity and not interfere in China's internal affairs.

    There is no doubt that Mr. Dulles, who is sitting opposite me now, will repeat the same false remarks about respecting China's territorial integrity and Chinese national sovereignty here again. I do not know how he will justify the U.S. seizure of Taiwan, the aggression against the People's Republic of China, the real, de facto policy, the China policy that the U.S. ruling clique is currently actually implementing, under the circumstances of such blatant violation and contravention of these principles and this position. He will probably cite Mr. Truman's statement of June 27 again, which said that all these measures are purely so-called preventive measures.

    In fact, what is referred to in Mr. Truman's statement is that the U.S. government should order the Seventh Fleet to cruise in the Taiwan Strait, should occupy Taiwan, or send its own armed forces to Taiwan in order to prevent "a direct threat to the security of the Pacific region," while the U.S. armed forces are performing some so-called "legal and necessary duties in this region." But perhaps I do not need to spend much time proving that all these statements are fabricated, false, and inconsistent with the facts.

    According to Truman's order, it seems that it is not foreign troops invading the territory of a sovereign country, but that the possible appearance of the troops of the aforementioned sovereign country on this territory constitutes a direct threat to the security of the Pacific region. It seems that it is not the appearance of U.S. armed forces in the territorial waters of another country, but the protest against this appearance that constitutes a threat to international security. It seems that these U.S. armed forces are stationed on the territory of another country to perform some "legal and necessary duties"; but why this is necessary is completely unknown; they are obviously illegal, and this is obvious to everyone, even to those who do not particularly care.

    It is not necessary to spend much time on all these completely fabricated and false explanations. You know, the matter is absolutely clear. Truman issued an order to the Seventh Fleet to enter Chinese territorial waters under the pretext of preventing an attack on Taiwan, but there is no such "attack" by the legitimate Chinese government at all, because the sovereignty of governing any part of Chinese territory, sending its own administrative agencies and garrisons to any part of its own territory belongs to the government of the People's Republic of China, and only belongs to it.

    Unless all concepts of law and sovereignty are distorted, unless national sovereignty and the autonomy of the people are mocked, how can it be said that the government of a country would "attack" a part of its own territory?

    Obviously, this reason is false and fabricated, because of course there can be no attack by the armed forces of a legitimate government on its own territory; this government is opposing a group of rebels who are illegally seizing and exercising government power, regardless of the clearly expressed will of the entire people, in this case, regardless of the clearly expressed will of the vast majority of the 475 million Chinese people. As mentioned above, it is also completely false and fabricated to say that the issue of the future "status of Taiwan" has not yet been resolved, that the resolution of this issue should be left to the restoration of Pacific security, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or the review of this issue by the United Nations, etc. And at the same time, they are trying to delay these issues and undermine all attempts to reach a settlement on this issue by the countries concerned.

    All such reasons are certainly "not able to deceive anyone," as can be seen from the world opinion's evaluation of the U.S. position. For example, a widely circulated U.S. newspaper wrote: "It is generally recognized that the Chinese people have now eliminated the corrupt and unpopular Chiang Kai-shek regime and established a government that is supported by the people... Some prominent U.S. post-war foreign policy leaders, such as General MacArthur, are trying to cancel the solemn obligations undertaken in Cairo and Potsdam. While these less subtle representatives of U.S. imperialism are openly proposing to occupy Taiwan, U.S. special envoy to the Far East, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Jessup, is hypocritically announcing the principle of Chinese territorial integrity at Lake Success..." This is an excerpt from the *Compass Daily*, and one cannot but agree with these words, but there should be a single correction: here it says Jessup, which is of course completely accidental. Here one could have said Jessup and Dulles, Acheson and – it would be far more accurate to say – Mr. Truman.

    Everyone knows that former U.S. President Hoover also defended the Nationalist Party group's support in Taiwan with the U.S. Navy in his letter to Senator Nolan. He declared that the United States should continue to recognize and support the Nationalist Party government, and should support Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and possibly Hainan Island with its own naval power. Senator Taft, one of the Republican leaders, also revealed the same intention in this regard; he stated at a press conference in early January of this year that he believed that Taiwan Island must be leased to Chiang Kai-shek as a U.S. naval base.

    Everyone knows that in June of this year, according to a report published by *Newsweek*, U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson at the time also advocated that the United States maintain Taiwan at all costs, and even, if necessary, send U.S. troops there... Speaking of this, it should be particularly pointed out that since the end of 1949, the U.S. government has strengthened military assistance to the Nationalist Party in Taiwan.

    U.S. State Department spokesman McDermott admitted at a press conference on January 10 of this year that the Nationalist Party had the right to purchase military supplies from the United States with the $125 million that Congress had allocated earlier. All of this proves nothing else, but proves that the aforementioned statements made by Truman and Acheson on January 5 of this year regarding the U.S. government's non-interference in Taiwan's affairs and China's internal affairs are merely a cover for acts of interference in China's internal affairs (and it should be said directly, a very failed cover), and a cover for the aggression that was prepared to be carried out against China.

    The U.S. Ruling Clique Repeatedly Clamors for Seizing Taiwan, and the United Nations Should Not Avoid These Words

    It was none other than General MacArthur who shamelessly and blatantly announced to the world the intention of the U.S. ruling clique to turn Taiwan into a U.S. military base in the Far East at all costs. I would now like to remind everyone of his "Letter to the Overseas Veterans Association." This letter must be discussed when discussing this issue. In this letter, General MacArthur explained in detail the strategic significance of Taiwan as an important link in the U.S. base chain extending from the Aleutian Islands to the Mariana Islands. In this letter, General MacArthur tried to prove that if the United States occupied such a link in Taiwan, it could control the western Pacific with its own air force. In this letter, General MacArthur explained the significance of Taiwan, pointing out that Taiwan is an "unsinkable aircraft carrier," it is an excellent and excellent submarine base, and in his words, "it is an ideal location for offensive operations."

    Everyone knows that General MacArthur's words are not just casual words, General MacArthur's words have now turned into the hot metal of U.S. weapons, he is not fighting with words, but with his own armed forces, he is not fighting for the purpose of respecting the territorial integrity of other countries, but for the aggressive purposes and aggressive plans that are the basis of the U.S. overall foreign policy. And these words and orders of General MacArthur are not simply the speeches or literary exercises of a desperate military fanatic and military adventurer. These are the words of the commander-in-chief who dominates the fate of thousands upon thousands of people, and his words and deeds are enough to destroy thousands upon thousands of people, enough to destroy many cities and villages.

    Therefore, MacArthur's words about the "unsinkable aircraft carrier" that provides a natural basis for protecting so-called U.S. interests (which are actually the interests of U.S. imperialists and monopoly capitalists in the Pacific), about the value of this base; these words have great significance and influence. And the United Nations has no right to avoid these words.

    On the official publication of the U.S. Department of the Army (I specifically point out that this is no longer *Newsweek*, nor is it the *Compass Daily*, but the official publication of the U.S. Department of the Army), in the *Armed Forces...* magazine, No. 335, it is also very blatantly stated that the United States should seize Taiwan Island. This issue of the magazine was published in August of this year, on the eve of the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, and it was designated for political propaganda in the U.S. military.

    According to a report by *New York Herald Tribune* reporter Higgins (this report has not been denied so far), Mr. Dulles also stated during his visit to Tokyo in June of this year that he believes that Taiwan is a "strategic island" related to the U.S. bases in Okinawa and the Philippines.

    Therefore, MacArthur, as a representative of the Army Command, and Dulles, as a representative of the State Department, have completely consistent views and plans on Taiwan and turning Taiwan into a U.S. naval base.

    Due to all the above facts, although the U.S. delegation at this session of the United Nations General Assembly strives to convince world opinion of the U.S.'s so-called "peace-loving" foreign policy, believing that the U.S. government has no aggressive intentions or plans for Taiwan, these efforts will be in vain. It cannot be believed, and no objective person will believe it.

    The Korean Military Action Was Originally Manufactured by the United States to Use as an Excuse for Aggression Against China Is a Fabricated Fact

    The U.S. government is trying to make it seem that its aggressive actions against Taiwan were caused by military necessities arising from the war the U.S. is waging in Korea. If this were indeed the case, then this would not legitimize the U.S. aggression against China, because no one has given either the U.S. government or any other government the right to undermine the territorial integrity of any country for any purpose, especially to ensure its own interests in armed intervention in Korea, which in the case we are discussing is the territorial integrity of China.

    However, regardless of this, this explanation by the U.S. ruling clique for the aggression against Taiwan is unfounded. Moreover, in essence, this explanation is an admission of its own aggression. At the same time, this explanation says – let me put it bluntly – that it is fabricating facts and distorting the truth, because the Korean military action was actually launched by U.S. interventionists.

    We have repeatedly pointed out here that there is absolutely no basis for accusing North Korea of aggression. In fact, the plan and the outrageous crime against peace, especially against the Korean people, was precisely to create an excuse to launch activities in this region of Asia that would help the U.S. ruling clique use Korea as a base for its future military adventures.

    All estimates were based on the erroneous assumption that the Korean people were unable to defend their own independence. We have seen how seriously the U.S. military adventurers miscalculated when formulating this military "plan," and they have completely disregarded all the circumstances that, although at the expense of the Korean people's disasters, broke all the criminal plans.

    Now they are using the Korean incident to justify their aggressive actions against China, but the Korean incident itself was prepared by them for the next purpose, and then they are using these incidents as an excuse to justify their next aggressive action against China.

    We believe that, in reality, it is far-fetched to use the military action in Korea as an excuse to explain the U.S. aggressive action against China. In fact, the U.S. aggressive action against China, which is now being reviewed by the First Committee, is a continuation of the long-standing policy of the U.S. ruling clique against the Chinese people. This policy was adopted by them long before the Korean War began, in order to fight against the Chinese People's Liberation Army in order to turn China into a U.S. colony.

    The U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan Was Carefully Prepared in Advance; The U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek Signed a Secret Military Agreement Last Year

    The U.S.'s aggressive actions against China in the Taiwan region were carefully prepared in advance. This can be seen from the series of speeches and statements I just cited on this issue, and if I disregard the short time, I could cite twice, twice, or even nine times more. They were prepared long before the outbreak of the Korean incident.

    As early as December 1949, the U.S. Department of the Navy formally declared that it would send an aircraft carrier with a displacement of 27,000 tons to Asian waters and send two destroyers to strengthen the U.S. Seventh Fleet currently operating in Taiwan waters.

    If the Department of the Navy openly announced its plan as early as last year (at that time, there was no hint of any Korean incident), it proves this point. Since the Department of the Navy had already declared its decision to send the Navy to Taiwan waters as early as December 1949, long before the Korean incident occurred, how can the Korean incident be used as an excuse to make the U.S. take those measures that have been taken in the past and are still being taken now for the sake of so-called "security" or "elimination of danger" in the Pacific?

    Is it not known that in 1949, the U.S. and the Nationalist Party group concluded a secret military agreement stipulating that the United States would supply the Nationalist Party with 16 warships, munitions and equipment for five divisions, radar for aircraft, and equipment for various repair factories?

    According to this agreement, the United States allocated a loan of $90 million to the Nationalist Party elements from the remaining amount of the previous loan that had not been used at that time, in addition to new additional allocations. This agreement was publicly published in the newspapers in January 1950.

    Many reports indicate that the U.S. government had prepared operational plans for Taiwan Island long before the Korean incident occurred. An Associated Press dispatch from Taipei on December 30, 1949, reported that more than 250 U.S. tanks belonging to the U.S. military had been transported to Taiwan since the second half of December. In January 1950, the agency reported that more than 200 tanks had been transported to Taiwan from Philadelphia, and on May 15 of this year, the Associated Press reported from Taiwan that another 42 U.S. tanks had been supplied to the area. At the same time, according to the U.S. Secretary of State's admission to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in March of this year, Nationalist Party elements dropped U.S. bombs from U.S. aircraft onto mainland China. This is the situation of the U.S. ruling clique's aggression against Taiwan under the cover of statements about respecting China's territorial integrity and political independence.

    The U.S. monopoly capitalists clamor for giving the Nationalist Party in Taiwan so-called "selfless economic assistance," but in reality, they are using this as a cover to seize the island's natural resources. It is also possible to further point out the explanation of this kind of "economic assistance" to China that the U.S. ruling clique is now applying.

    Everyone knows that according to the agreement on the joint development of Taiwan's natural resources signed by representatives of U.S. monopoly capital and Nationalist Party elements as early as February 1948, the United States obtained a monopoly on the exploitation of Taiwan's oil, coal, gold, sulfur, tung oil, and antimony. The U.S. "Reynolds Metals Company" had invested $35 million in the aluminum metal industry in Taiwan as early as February 1948, or more precisely, according to newspaper reports, since February 1948, becoming the monopoly owner of aluminum production on the island. U.S. industrialists have manipulated more than 10% of all major factories in Taiwan. The U.S. so-called "Fertilizer Association" is the monopolist of all fertilizer manufacturing enterprises on the island. Most of Taiwan's power plants are controlled by U.S. monopoly capitalists, especially the monopoly concern "Westinghouse Electric Corporation." U.S. monopoly capitalists have seized enterprises producing camphor, paper, and salt, and have carried out unilateral and distorted rural economic transformation on the island through the Nationalist Party puppet regime, resulting in a considerable part of the island's land being turned into sugarcane and camphor tree plantations, damaging the production of rice and other food crops, and plunging the residents of Taiwan into hunger. These are the facts, which convincingly prove what the so-called economic "assistance" to Taiwan actually is, and they also convincingly prove that the U.S. ruling clique has embarked on the road of open aggression against China, the purpose of which is to support the remnants of the Nationalist Party regime to fight against the Chinese people and their legitimate Central People's Government, to turn Taiwan Island into its own strategic and military base, and to develop the island's natural resources for the benefit of U.S. monopoly capitalists.

    Needless to say, the U.S. government's goal is not limited to seizing Taiwan Island. The seizure of Taiwan Island has now been proven to be a fact... The U.S. government's goal is even more far-reaching. The United States is not only invading China in Taiwan. Everyone knows that since the late summer of this year, for several months, U.S. military aircraft have systematically violated Chinese airspace in the areas bordering China and North Korea, bombing and strafing Chinese territory, causing many Chinese deaths and causing great material losses to China, repeatedly arousing the righteous protests of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. When discussing the bombing of Chinese territory by U.S. aircraft, the First Committee will review these U.S. aggressive actions against China again. As is well known, the General Committee recently decided to move this issue from the Special Political Committee to the First Committee, so when discussing the next item on the agenda, we will have the opportunity to make supplementary specialized discussions on this issue. I am talking about this now only to supplement the facts of those illegal actions, to supplement the facts of those illegal actions by which the U.S. ruling clique has arrogantly and systematically undermined the sovereignty of the Chinese people, undermined the sovereignty of the Chinese state and its government, and undermined the legitimate and proper interests of the Chinese state.

    We are talking about this only to specifically point out that the U.S. ruling clique's aggressive actions against Taiwan are, in essence, only a link in a series of aggressive actions that constitute the entire aggressive plan against the Chinese state, against the People's Republic of China. The situation proved by the large-scale attacks by the U.S. Air Force on Northeast China cannot be explained as the U.S. government attempts to do, explaining it as "purely pilot errors" caused by some climatic conditions. What climatic conditions are at play here? Without a doubt, it is the political climate that determines this incident, not the natural climate.

    In the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, it is stated: "As soon as the U.S. war of aggression against Korea began, it dispatched the Navy to invade China's Taiwan, and then dispatched the Air Force to invade the airspace of Northeast China and carry out bombing... The U.S. Air Force's invasion of Chinese airspace, bombing of Chinese territory, killing of Chinese people, and destruction of Chinese property have been occurring endlessly for three months... The number of times has been increasing daily recently. All these acts of violence by the U.S. military that violate Chinese territory, sovereignty, and threaten China's security have sounded the alarm for the entire Chinese people... The facts have proved that the U.S.'s purpose in invading Korea is not only for Korea itself, but also to expand its aggression against China." The statement also said: "The U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, invaded China's Taiwan, and bombed the territory of Northeast China, thus seriously threatening China's security." This is a completely correct assessment of the illegal actions of the U.S. ruling clique that infringe upon China and the Chinese people, these actions blatantly violate the universally recognized basic standards and principles of international law and the international obligations assumed by the U.S. government by signing various agreements.

    The United Nations Should Take Necessary Steps to Stop the U.S.'s Unbridled Aggressive Actions

    Everyone knows the U.S. ruling clique's hatred for the democratic forces of the Chinese people and their national liberation struggle, and it did not happen today. This hatred can be traced back to the U.S.'s participation in the armed suppression of the Chinese people's uprising by foreign interventionists, the well-known so-called "Boxer Movement" at the beginning of this century. During the recent Chinese civil war, the representatives of the U.S. ruling clique did not hide their hostility towards the progressive forces of China, spending billions of dollars to arm the Nationalist Party reactionaries who opposed in the past and continue to oppose the Chinese people with U.S. weapons. The U.S. ruling clique is unwilling to accept the victory of the Chinese people, and is unwilling to accept the failure of its China policy. But I think it seems that it is time to accept this fact, it seems that it is even time to show a little foresight and thus draw a considerable conclusion, and that conclusion is to support the recognition of the People's Republic of China and to support the cessation of all offensives - this offensive will undoubtedly end in complete failure.

    All the above facts irrefutably confirm that the following aggressive actions of the U.S. government against China exist... (At this time, the delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Wu Xiuquan entered the conference hall and was seated). Please forgive me, I will interrupt my speech for the time being. I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of our Soviet delegation to pay tribute to Mr. Wu Xiuquan, the representative of the legitimate Chinese government

    维辛斯基十一月二十七日联大政委会上
    关于“苏联控诉美国侵略中国案”演说全文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十一月三十日电：苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在联合国大会政治委员会十一月二十七日会议上发表关于美国侵略中国的演说。全文如下：
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟代表团提请联合国大会讨论关于美利坚合众国侵略中华人民共和国的问题。
    美国非法地占领了台湾及其领海横暴地蹂躏国际公法标准与原则
    大家知道，一九五○年六月二十七日美国总统正式对美国第七舰队发布命令，在以“阻止对台湾的任何进攻”为掩饰下，对中国的台湾岛采取暴力行动。大家知道，美国海军执行这项命令，已开到了台湾海岸，对该岛实行海上封锁，并在台湾海峡巡逻。此后，台湾各港口就变成了美国海军的基地。而不久之后，正如美国以及全世界的报纸都已报道过的那样，又有若干美国空军部队连同其人员调到了台湾。台湾并驻有所谓麦克阿瑟总部的“联络组”，据报纸报道，后来又改组为“美国远东军驻台考察团”。
    美国军队就这样横暴地蹂躏了国际公法的一切标准与原则，而非法地占领了台湾岛及其领海，并且像在被征服的地区一样地驻扎在台湾地区，驻扎在这个中国的岛屿上。
    并且，人人都知道，台湾一向是中国的领土，台湾是中国不可分割的一部分。从下面的事实看来就已是十分明显的了：许多世纪以来台湾就属于中国；而从这岛上居民的民族成分来说，据最近的统计，百分之九十八是中国人；最后，还有第二次世界大战过程中缔订的若干国际协定。苏联代表团曾经唤起政治委员会注意开罗与波茨坦关于台湾的国际协定，关于台湾归还中国的协定；这些协定都是美国政府在上面签了字的。
    美国当局及其盟国实际上经常用日本人对台湾的称呼，把台湾叫做福摩萨。虽然这并不是日本的岛屿，而是过去曾被日本人占领、现在却被美国人占领的中国岛屿。因此我在任何地方都将说台湾，而不说福摩萨，因为台湾是它的民族称呼，谁也没有权利来破坏这个传统。
    我们还曾唤起注意美国总统杜鲁门与国务卿艾奇逊在本年一月的声明，在这些声明中他们曾提起过根据在开罗及波茨坦协定下美国所承担的国际义务，关于台湾归还中国以及该岛包括在中国领土内并成为其不可分割的一部分的义务。杜鲁门先生与艾奇逊先生在上述声明中曾宣称，美国将不干涉台湾的事务，并且一般地说不干涉中国内政。美国国务院后来在一九五○年二月九日的正式声明中也曾经谈到这一点，在这里，我也愿意提醒政治委员会注意这个声明的全文。
    这个声明是这样说的：“一九五○年一月五日总统的声明，乃是美利坚合众国确认有关解决台湾（声明中称福摩萨）问题的开罗宣言。自一九四五年起，台湾（声明中称福摩萨）就已由中国管理。……它已包括在中国之内，成为一省。……参加对日战争的各盟国对这些步骤并无疑议。美国对这些步骤也没有疑议。因为这些步骤，完全符合于在开罗所达成而又在波茨坦所确认的协定。换句话说——这个声明说——包括美国在内的各盟国，在过去四年中认为福摩萨（即台湾）是中国的一部分，而如果美国政府在目前希图在福摩萨（台湾）建立由于在最高统帅以及盟国占领军、在联合国组织、或者在远东委员会的监督之下举行全民投票的结果而产生的非中国的行政当局，这就会被中国大陆上以及全亚洲几乎一切的人认为是我们的政府违反了我们的义务，并与和我们一向尊重中国领土完整的政策相矛盾，企图使福摩萨（台湾）脱离中国。”
    因此我们可以看出：至少从美国外交政策的领导者——国务卿——对于美国总统杜鲁门声明所作的权威性的说明中都可以很明白地得出这样三个情况：（一）毫无疑问，台湾属于中国，是中国领土不可分的一部分；（二）决不容从事这里所指的那种行动，因为这会被一切的人认为违反美国自己所庄严担负的义务，就是在开罗和波茨坦，在开罗和波茨坦协定中，无论那一次所担负的义务都会被违反了；（三）承认：企图在在占领军当局或联合国组织监督之下而不是在中国政府监督之下，在台湾建立行政当局，就是意味着企图使台湾脱离中国，而违背了上述的义务。这就是美国在一九五○年初对于台湾问题所采取的立场。
    然而，美国政府不顾这些和其他的声明，却横暴地违背了它因开罗和波茨坦协定而对台湾所负的义务，夺取了台湾，并派军队加以占领，因而破坏了中国领土的完整，蛮横地蹂躏了国际法的基本标准和联合国宪章的原则。
    我应当引证联合国宪章第二条第四款，该款规定联合国一切会员国“在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”。
    本年六月二十七日美国总统的命令规定对台湾直接使用武力。美国政府以这些非法的行动，最不可容忍地违背了联合国宪章，这难道还不明白吗？美国政府以暴力政策对待联合国宪章所规定的尊重各国领土完整、政治独立的原则，并在国际关系上横行霸道，这难道还不明白吗？
    杜鲁门在对美国第七舰队发布命令时所作的声明，以及后来美国武装部队对台湾的行动，都已证明美国政府在对中国的关系上，已走上了如我所说过的以最残暴的武力方式——武装方式——实施武力政策的道路。
    美国将所谓“福摩萨问题”列入议程
    意图假借联合国掩盖侵略台湾行动
    目前，像大会总务委员会与大会全体会议讨论关于把所谓“福摩萨问题”列入大会议程的问题时所表明的那样，美国统治集团是意图假借联合国的招牌、联合国的旗帜、联合国的名义，来掩饰他们自己对中国的台湾岛的侵略行动，正像他们在朝鲜所作的那样。这就是利用若干安全理事会理事国的非法决议，把它们强行说成是安理会的决议，而我们却早就证明过这是横暴地违背联合国宪章所根据的原则而通过的。在这种情况下，我们应该怎样评判这样一个国家的行为呢，它以武装部队侵犯其他主权国的领土与领海，对该国的海岸或海岸的一部分实施封锁，以武力威胁合法政府，同时并干涉这个主权国的内政。对这种行为的评判是无可置疑的。对这种行为的评判只能有一个，而且是完全确定的一个。这就是显然的侵略。这是对中国的侵略行为，其目的在支持已经破产了的、已被中国人民推翻了的国民党集团来进行反对中国人民唯一合法的中国政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府的斗争。
    我们认为在中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来本年六月二十八日的声明中，对于这种非法行为，对于美国政府对中华人民共和国政府的这种非法行为的评定是完全公正的，这个声明说：“杜鲁门二十七日的声明和美国海军的行动，乃是对于中国领土的武装侵略，对联合国宪章的彻底破坏。”
    大家知道，美国统治集团干涉中国内政，是有其悠久历史的。这个干涉行动是长久以来一再实行过的，而目前美国政府对中国的台湾岛所实行的那种非法行动，只不过是美国统治集团在与国民党反动派以军事装备上、在支持国民党反动派反对中国人民的民族解放运动的斗争上（虽然无论怎样，对这种争取中国民族解放与统一的伟大人民运动继续斗争全都是绝望而且愚蠢的）各种干涉行动的一长串锁链中新的一环而已。
    美国有计划地供给国民党以武器杀死成千成万中国人民的好儿女
    大家知道，例如在一九四六年到一九四九年间（我只举最近这三年的例子，姑勿论我已简略说到的一九五○年），美国政府为在军事上与经济上援助蒋介石的反动国民党集团进行反对中国民主力量的斗争，曾拨予庞大的款项。大家还记得，美国国务院的“白皮书”中即曾承认这种援助计达三十亿美元以上。美国政府，过去而且现在还在继续有计划地以武器供给国民党军队，这些武器在五年当中，杀死了成千成万中国人民的好儿女。
    美国军事顾问和教官过去曾经而且现在还在继续训练和武装国民党军队，并积极参加制定反对人民解放军、即反对中国人民的作战计划。美国海军和空军曾经并且还在大量输送国民党军队到达反对中国国家和中国人民的作战地区。可是，尽管有美国统治集团的这一切努力，他们却并没有能够靠国民党傀儡政权压服那强大的运动，中国人民的民族解放运动。反人民的国民党集团已被中国人民逐出了中国大陆，而在台湾岛上，在美国刺刀的庇护下——在美国武装部队的庇护下暂时避难。
    美国政府所称美国武装部队的目的是要阻止中华人民共和国进入台湾的声明，意味着美国政府不仅继续干涉中国的内战，而且还在这个斗争中公开使用自己的军队。这件事情本身就充分证明了美国政府对中国的武装侵略，证明了苏联对美国统治集团这类非法侵略行动的控诉是正义的。
    美国政府为了达到它自己对中国的目的，便采取一切措施来加强与反人民的国民党集团的合作。
    应该提醒一下，还在本年八月初，麦克阿瑟将军完成了台湾之行，并且，据各方面报道，在他访问台湾时曾为一项有效的合作完成了布置，这就是在他的统率下美国军队与国民党方面所握有的，或如麦克阿瑟所称，“中国政府”方面所握有的武装部队的有效合作，他以这样一种幻想来安慰自己，他不是同最后的渣滓打交道，同已经注定要从历史的章页上最终消失的旧日政府的最后残余打交道，而是仍旧同某个所谓“政府”打交道。大家知道，蒋介石在与麦克阿瑟会晤后曾宣称，在他与“他的老战友麦克阿瑟将军”（他这样称呼麦克阿瑟）之间已就台湾的军事合作问题达成了协议。
    由此可见，美国统治集团虽然对中国的侵略政策遭受了完全失败，虽然在正式发表的美国国务院的“白皮书”中已经公开地承认了这个失败，可是至今并没有放弃以一切手段恢复在中国的旧统治这种妄想，为达此目的，就利用在台湾的国民党反动派残余，并使用自己的武装部队。
    台湾的主权属于中华人民共和国杜鲁门所持的干涉理由是虚妄的
    为了支持中国人民的敌人，美国统治集团就以中国的民主的不可调和的敌人的身分出现，以中国人民民族解放运动的不可调和的敌人的身分出现，毫不踌躇来横暴地破坏中国的主权、中国政府的主权，姑不论美国承认不承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府。美国对中国的侵略追求着深远的目的。其目的之一便是要避免国民党集团被逐出它最后巢穴——台湾岛，并从而为美国保持一种可能性，使它能利用这个岛屿作为美国进一步侵略中国及侵略远东的军事基地。美国十分负责的，因而在这个问题上表示确定的官方立场的著名政治家们一系列的演说，令人信服地说明了美国统治集团的这种图谋。早在一九四九年十二月和本年一月，美国若干政治家，尤其是参议员史密斯和诺兰就曾提出公开干涉中国的方案，提出规定占领台湾并把这个岛屿变为美国军事基地的方案。所有这一切都是在美国代表团在第四届联合国大会上一方面嗾使其国民党代理人对苏联提出居心叵测的诽谤，同时又伪善地表明必须尊重中国领土的完整和不干涉中国内政的当时及其以后所发生的。
    毫无疑问，就是现在坐在我的对面的杜勒斯先生，又将在这里重复这些关于尊重中国领土完整和中国国家主权的同样虚伪的言论。我不知道，他在如此横暴地破坏和违背这种原则和这种立场的情形下，将怎样辩解美国攫夺台湾、侵略中华人民共和国的、真正的、事实上的政策，美国统治集团目前实际上正在实行的对华政策。他大概又将引证六月二十七日杜鲁门先生的声明了，这个声明中说什么所有这一切措施都纯粹是所谓预防性的。
    其实，在杜鲁门先生的声明中所指的是，美国政府应该授命第七舰队在台湾海峡游弋，应该占领台湾，或者把自己的武装部队进驻台湾，以便防止“对太平洋地区的安全的直接威胁”，而美国武装部队则在执行其某种所谓“在这个地区的合法而必要的职务”。可是也许用不着我多费唇舌来证明，所有这一切说法都是捏造的，虚妄的，都是与实情不符的。
    按照杜鲁门的命令来说，好像并不是外国部队侵入了一个主权国的领土，而是上述主权国部队之可能在这块领土上出现构成了对太平洋地区安全的直接威胁。好像并不是美国武装部队之在他国领海上出现，而是对这种出现的抗议构成了对国际安全的威胁。好像这些美国武装部队驻在他国领土上是执行某种“合法而必要的职务”；可是为何有此必要呢，这却完全不得而知了；他们显然是非法的，对于每一个人，甚至对于并不特别关心的人，这也都是显而易见的。
    在所有这一切完全是捏造的、虚妄的解释上多费唇舌是没有必要的。你们知道，事情是绝对明白的，杜鲁门是以阻止对台湾的进攻为借口而对第七舰队发布命令，进入中国领海的，但是这里却根本谈不到中国合法政府的这种“进攻”，因为治理中国领土的任何部分，将自己的行政机构与卫戍部队派往自己领土任何部分的这种主权是属于中华人民共和国政府，而且是只属于它的。
    要不是歪曲关于法律与主权的一切概念，要不是嘲弄国家主权与人民的自主权，怎么能够说一国政府会对其自己领土的一部分“进攻”呢？
    显然，这种理由是虚妄的，捏造的，因为当然根本谈不到一个合法政府的武装部队对其自己领土的进攻；这个政府是在反对不顾全体人民明确表现的意志，在这个场合，便是不顾四亿七千五百万中国人民的绝大多数所明确表现的意志，而非法盗名擅行政府职权的一群乱党。同上面所说的一样，说什么未来“台湾地位”问题尚未解决，说什么这一问题的解决应该留待太平洋安全的恢复，留待对日和约的缔结，或留待联合国审议这一问题等等，这些理由也都完全是虚妄的，捏造的。并且就在同时他们又竭力使这些问题迁延下去，破坏一切使有关各国在这个问题上达成解决的企图。
    所有这样的理由都是肯定“谁也骗不了的”，由世界舆论对美国立场的评价就可以看出。例如，美国一家销路很广的报纸曾写道：“据一般公认，现在中国人民已消灭了腐败的、不孚众望的蒋介石政权，而建立了受到人民拥戴的政府……像麦克阿瑟将军这样一些显要的美国战后外交政策的思想领袖，正在力图取消在开罗和波茨坦所承担的庄严义务。正当这些较少含蓄的美国帝国主义的代表们公开提议占领台湾的时候，美国的远东特使、美国驻联合国代表耶塞普，却在成功湖伪善地宣布中国领土完整的原则……。”这是从《指南针日报》中摘录下来的，人们不能不同意它的这些话，不过要有唯一的修正：这里说耶塞普，当然完全是偶然的。这里本可以说耶塞普与杜勒斯、艾奇逊与——这样说将远较正确——杜鲁门先生。
    大家都知道，前美国总统胡佛在其致参议员诺兰的信中也曾为以美国海军在台湾支持国民党集团辩护过。他宣称，美国应该继续承认并支持国民党政府，对台湾、澎湖群岛，以及可能还有海南岛，应该用自己的海军力量予以支持。共和党领袖之一、参议员塔夫脱在这方面也吐露过同样的意向；他已在今年一月初新闻记者招待会上声明，他认为，必须向蒋介石把台湾岛承租过来，作为美国的海军基地。
    大家知道，在本年六月，据《新闻周刊》发表的报道，当时美国国防部长詹森也力主美国以一切代价保持台湾，甚至，在必要时，把美国军队派到那里去……说到这里，应该特别指出，自一九四九年底起，美国政府已加强了对台湾国民党人的军事援助。
    美国国务院新闻发布官麦克德谟在本年一月十日的记者招待会上承认，国民党人有权以国会早先拨给的一亿二千五百万美元向美国购买军需品。凡此一切都不是证明了别的，却是证明了上述杜鲁门和艾奇逊本年一月五日所作关于美国政府不干涉台湾事务及中国内政的声明，只不过是对于干涉中国内政的行为的掩饰（并且应该直截了当地说，是非常失败的掩饰），是对于已准备对中国进行的侵略的掩饰。
    美统治集团一再叫嚣夺取台湾联合国不应对这些话避不过问
    不是别人，正是麦克阿瑟将军，竟在不久以前无耻地露骨地向全世界宣告美国统治集团的意图，要以一切代价把台湾变为美国在远东的军事基地。我现在向大家提醒他的“致海外退伍军人协会的信”。讨论这个问题时不可不谈这封信。麦克阿瑟将军在这封信上详尽地说明了作为由阿留申群岛伸延到马利亚纳群岛的美国基地锁炼中重要一环的台湾所具有的战略意义。麦克阿瑟将军在这封信中力图证明，美国如果占有台湾这样的一环，就可以靠自己的空军而统治太平洋西部。麦克阿瑟将军在这封信上解释台湾的意义指出，台湾是“不沉的航空母舰”，它是优良的绝妙的潜水艇基地，用他的话来说，“是攻势作战的理想地点”。
    大家都知道，麦克阿瑟将军的话并不是随便说说的，麦克阿瑟将军的话现在已化成美国武器的炙热的金属了，他并不是用言语作战，而是用自己的武装力量作战的，他不是为了有关别国领土完整的那种目的作战，而是为了作为美国全盘外交政策基础的侵略目的和侵略计划作战的。而且麦克阿瑟将军的这些话和命令并非简单地是什么孤注一掷的军事狂人、军事冒险家的发言或文学练习而已。这是支配着成千成万人们的命运的总司令的话，他的一言一语足以使成千成万的人毁灭，足以使许多城市和乡村毁灭。
    因此，麦克阿瑟关于给保护所谓美国利益（其实是美帝国主义者及垄断资本家在太平洋的利益）提供天然基础的“不沉的航空母舰”的话，关于这种基地的价值的话；这些话具有巨大的意义和影响的。而联合国无权对这些话避不过问。
    在美国陆军部正式机关刊（我特别指明，这已不是《新闻周刊》，也已不是《指南针日报》，而是美国陆军部的正式机关刊）上，在《武装部队……》杂志第三三五号上也极其露骨地讲到美国应该夺取台湾岛，这期杂志是在本年八月，在联合国大会开会前夕出版的，而且是指定供在美国军队中进行政治宣传用的。
    据《纽约先驱论坛报》记者赫金斯报道（这个报道至今尚未被否认过），杜勒斯先生在本年六月访问东京时也曾声言，他认为台湾是与美国在冲绳岛及菲律宾的基地相关联的“战略岛屿”。
    因此，作为陆军统帅部代表的麦克阿瑟与作为国务院代表的杜勒斯，对于台湾，对于把台湾变为美国海军基地一点，是具有完全一致的观点和计划的。
    由于上述的一切事实，虽然美国代表团在本届联合国大会上力求世界舆论相信美国的所谓“爱好和平”的外交政策，相信美国政府对台湾所谓没有侵略企图和计划，但是这些努力都将是徒然的。不能相信它，任何一个客观的人都不会相信它。
    朝鲜军事行动原是美国一手制造以此为侵略中国借口是伪造事实
    美国政府企图把事情说成好像它对台湾的侵略行动是由于美国在朝鲜进行的战争而起的军事必要所引起的。如果说实情确是这样的话，那末这也并不能就使美国侵略中国的行动成为合法，因为谁也没有赋予无论是美国政府或任何其他政府以权利，为了不论何种目的，尤其是为了保证自己武装干涉朝鲜的利益来破坏任何国家的领土完整，在我们所谈的情况下，就是中国的领土完整。
    然而，与此无关，美国统治集团对于侵略台湾的这种解释，是毫无根据的。而且，从本质上说，这种解释就是供认自己进行了侵略。同时这种解释说是——让我直率地说——伪造事实，歪曲事情的真相，因为朝鲜的军事行动实际上正是美国干涉者所发动的。
    我们曾在这里一再指出，控诉北朝鲜侵略是绝无任何根据的，实际上，计划并干出这种令人愤慨的反对和平、尤其是反对朝鲜人民的滔天罪行，正是要造作借口来在亚洲的这个地区展开有助于美国统治集团利用朝鲜作为自己将来军事冒险的基地的活动。
    一切估计都是建筑在错误的假定上的，这就是以为朝鲜人民无力保卫自己的独立。我们看见，美国军事冒险家在拟定这种军事“方案”时何等严重地估计错误了，他们毫没有顾忌到那些虽然以朝鲜人民的灾难为代价，但却打破了这些犯罪计划的一切情况。
    现在他们以朝鲜事件来辩护自己侵略中国的行动，可是朝鲜事件本身就是他们自己为了下一目的而准备的，随后却又用这些事件为借口来为自己下一个对中国的侵略行动辩护。
    我们认为，实际上，以在朝鲜的军事行动为借口来解释美国对中国的侵略行动，是牵强附会的。实际上，现在第一委员会所审议的美国对中国的侵略行动，乃是早已存在的美国统治集团对中国人民的政策的继续，这个政策，早在朝鲜战争开始以前许久就已被他们采用而对中国人民解放军进行斗争，以便把中国变为美国的殖民地。
    美国侵略台湾事先经过周密准备去年美蒋即曾签订秘密军事协定
    美国在台湾地区对中国的侵略行动，是经过事先周密准备的。这从我刚才引证的关于这个问题的一系列的演说和发言中就可以看出来，这些演说与发言如果不顾时间短促的话，我还可以多举出一倍、两倍、以至九倍来。他们在朝鲜事件爆发的很久以前就已准备好了。
    早在一九四九年十二月美国海军部就已正式宣称，它将派遣排水量达二万七千吨的航空母舰前往亚洲海面，并派两艘驱逐舰去增强现今在台湾海面活动的美国第七舰队。
    如果说海军部还在去年（那时还没有任何朝鲜事件的暗示），就已公然宣布了它那样的计划，那就正说明了这个问题。既然早在一九四九年十二月，即在朝鲜事件发生很久以前，海军部就已经宣称决定派遣海军前往台湾海面，那么怎么可以借口朝鲜事件而为了所谓太平洋上的“安全”或“危险的消除”而使美国采取过去已经采取、现在仍在采取的那些措施呢。
    难道还不知道，在一九四九年时美国与国民党集团就缔订了秘密军事协定，规定由美国供给国民党十六艘军舰、五个师的军火和装备、供给飞机用雷达、以及各种修理工厂的设备吗？
    依照这一协定，美国那时自没有动用过的以前贷款的余数中拨给国民党分子九千万美元的贷款，此外，还有新的追加拨款。这个协定是曾于一九五○年一月在报纸上公开发表过的。
    许多报道说明，美国政府早在朝鲜事件发生很久以前就已准备好了关于台湾岛的作战。美联社一九四九年十二月三十日台北电曾报道，从十二月下半月开始，有二百五十辆以上属于美军的美国坦克运到了台湾。一九五○年一月该社曾报道，有二百辆以上坦克由费拉德尔菲亚运到台湾，而在本年五月十五日，美联社又自台湾报道，另有四十二辆美国坦克供给该地。同时，据美国国务卿在参议院外交委员会上承认，本年三月份国民党分子从美国飞机上向中国大陆投掷美国炸弹。这就是美国统治集团在关于尊重中国国家的领土完整和政治独立的声明这种掩盖下，侵略台湾的情形。
    美国垄断资本家叫嚣给台湾国民党以所谓“大公无私的经济援助”，实际上却就是以此作为掩护来攫夺该岛的天然富源。还可以再指出不少美国统治集团现在所应用的这种对中国“经济援助”的解释。
    大家都知道，依照早在一九四八年二月美国垄断资本的代表与国民党分子所缔订的关于联合开发台湾自然资源的协定，美国曾取得了开采台湾的石油、煤、金、硫黄、桐油以及锑的垄断权。美国“雷诺金属公司”，早在一九四八年二月，或更确切地说，根据报纸报道，在从一九四八年二月以来，就在台湾对铝金属工业投资达三千五百万美元，成为该岛铝生产的垄断主人。美国工业家已把台湾全部主要工厂的百分之十以上操纵在自己手里。美国所谓“肥料协会”，乃是该岛所有制造肥料企业的垄断者。台湾大部分发电厂都被美国垄断资本家，尤其是垄断康采恩“威斯丁豪斯电力公司”所控制了。美国垄断资本家攫有生产樟脑、纸张、食盐的企业，并经过国民党傀儡政权在该岛进行片面的畸形的农村经济改造，结果使该岛相当大的一部分土地变为甘蔗和樟树的栽培场，损害了稻米及其他粮食作物的生产，而使台湾居民陷于饥饿的命运。这就是事实，它们令人信服地证明了所谓对台湾的经济“援助”实际上是什么，它们也同样令人信服地证明了，美国统治集团已走上公开侵略中国的道路，其目的就在于支持国民党政权的残余对中国人民及其合法的中央人民政府进行斗争，在于把台湾岛变为自己的战略和军事基地，在于为美国垄断资本家的利益而开发该岛的天然富源。
    不用说明，美国政府这样的目的是并不止于夺取台湾岛的。夺取台湾岛现在已证明是事实了……。美国政府的目的还要更为深远。美国并不是仅仅在台湾侵略中国。大家都知道，从本年夏末起几个月以来，美国军用飞机曾有系统地侵犯中朝接壤地区的中国领空，轰炸和扫射中国领土，使中国牺牲了许多人的生命，给中国造成了很大的物质损失，一再引起了中国政府和中国人民正义的抗议。在讨论美国飞机轰炸中国领土时，第一委员会将再审议美国对中国的这些侵略行动。如所周知，不久以前总务委员会曾决议，这个问题由特别政治委员会移到第一委员会，所以，在讨论议程的下一议案时，我们将有机会对这个问题作补充性的专门讨论，我现在谈到这点不过是为了补充那些非法行动的实况，补充是美国统治集团横暴地有系统地破坏中国人民的主权，破坏中国国家及其政府的主权，破坏中国国家合法的正当的利益那些非法行动的实况。
    我们谈到这点不过是为了特别指出，美国统治集团对台湾的侵略行动，从本质上说只不过是构成对中国国家，对中华人民共和国的整个侵略计划的一连串侵略行动中的一环而已。美国空军大批袭击中国东北所证明的情形却不能像美国政府所企图做的那样，他们把这解释为由于什么气候条件而造成的“纯粹飞行员的错误”。是什么气候条件在这里起作用呢？毫无疑问，这是决定这个事件的政治气候，而不是自然气候。
    在中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部的声明中说道：“美国侵略朝鲜的战争一开始，即出动海军侵略中国的台湾，接着又出动空军侵入中国东北的领空，并施行轰炸……。美国空军侵略中国领空、轰炸中国领土、杀害中国人民、毁坏中国财产一事，则三个月以来层出不穷……。其次数到最近已逐日增加。美国军队所有这一切侵犯中国领土、主权与威胁中国安全的暴行，向全中国人民敲起了警钟……。事实证明了，美国侵略朝鲜的目的，不仅是为了朝鲜本身，而且是为了扩大侵略中国。”声明并说道：“美国帝国主义者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，侵略了中国的台湾，轰炸了中国东北的领土，因而严重地威胁了中国的安全。”这是对于美国统治集团侵害中国与中国人民的非法行动的完全正确的评价，这些行动横暴地违背了举世公认的国际法的基本标准和原则以及美国政府因签署各项协定而担负的国际义务。
    对于美国肆无忌惮的侵略行动联合国应采必要步骤予以制止
    美国统治集团对中国人民的民主力量，及其民族解放斗争的仇视，是大家所深知的，而且不是今天才发生的。这种仇视可以一直追溯到美国参加外国干涉者武装镇压中国人民起义，即本世纪初有名的所谓“义和团运动”。在最近的中国内战时期，美国统治集团的代表毫不隐讳自己对中国进步力量的敌视，花费了数以十亿计的美元，以美国武器武装过去反对、而且现在继续反对中国人民的国民党反动派。美国统治集团不甘心中国人民的胜利，不甘心自己对华政策的失败。可是我以为：似乎已经是甘心于这件事实的时候了，似乎已经是甚至表现一点远见并从而得出一个相当结论的时候了，这个结论就是赞成承认中华人民共和国并赞成停止一切进攻——这种进攻无疑地将以完全的失败而结束。
    所有上述一切事实无可辩驳地证实了，下述美国政府对中国的侵略行动是存在着的……（这时，以伍修权为首的中华人民共和国代表团进入会议厅，并被引就座）。请原谅，我暂且中断我的演说。我愿以我们苏联代表团的名义借此机会向在主席的邀请下现在正在会议桌前就座的中国合法政府的代表伍修权先生以及代表团其他成员致敬，并祝他们今天在联合国组织中开始的活动成功。我且继续讲下去。所举的事实无可辩驳地证实了，下述美国政府对中国的侵略行动是存在着的：
    甲、美国武装部队侵犯台湾岛，而台湾岛乃是中国领土不可分的一部分。
    乙、美国海军封锁中国领土不可分的一部分台湾岛的海岸，目的在阻止中华人民共和国合法政府的武装部队和政权进入该岛，这同时也是侵犯中国领土的完整。
    丙、美国统治集团武装干涉中国内政，同时并以对唯一的合法政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府使用武力相威胁；这同时就是横暴地破坏中国的国家主权和政治独立。
    第一委员会不能够而也不应该避不过问美国集团对中国进行肆无忌惮的侵略的这些事实。当一国——联合国会员国（在我们所谈的情况下就是美国）占领了另一主权国——联合国会员国的一部分领土，破坏其领土完整，干涉其内政，使用自己的武装部队参加已由中国人民（他们现正努力确立本国的完全和平与安宁，努力肃清尚在美国卵翼下并在美国军队保护下窝藏在台湾的一小撮乱党和阴谋分子）的完全胜利而行将结束的内战，联合国组织决不能听任这种情况存在。这是一小撮反对合法政府的阴谋分子………鼓励美国对于这一小撮乱党和阴谋分子反对中国合法主权政府的庇护行动是不合乎联合国组织如第一委员会、安理会及联合国大会这样的权威性机构的身份的。
    鉴于上述一切，苏联代表团提议大会要求安全理事会采取必要行动来立刻停止美国对中国的侵略。为此，我们提出自己提案如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟对美利坚合众国侵略中国的控诉。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟
    提案
    在审议了美国侵略中国的问题，听取了中华人民共和国代表团关于这个问题的声明和美国代表团的解释以后，在讨论了美国海、空部队侵犯中国领土完整及其边界的神圣不可侵犯性的事实——这些事实表现在：甲、美国武装部队入侵台湾岛，而台湾岛乃是中国领土不可分割的一部分，一九四三年十二月一日的三强——美国、英国和中国——的开罗协定已予承认；美国政府因而干涉了中国内政。乙、美国海军第七舰队封锁台湾岛海岸，怀有敌意的目的，即不让中华人民共和国的军队和当局进入该岛——以后，大会兹特要求安全理事会采取必要步骤，俾使美国对中国的侵略立即停止。”
