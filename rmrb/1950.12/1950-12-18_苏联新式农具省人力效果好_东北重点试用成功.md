    Soviet New-Style Farm Implements Save Labor and Produce Good Results
    Successful Pilot Program in Northeast China
    [Xinhua News Agency] The pilot program for the Soviet new-style farm implements, implemented with a focus in the rural areas of Northeast China, has achieved success. The results of the pilot program demonstrate that Soviet new-style farm implements are highly efficient, capable of deep plowing and fine cultivation, and save labor.
    In order to improve agricultural technology, develop agricultural production, and learn from the advanced farming methods of the Soviet Union, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government, from the spring plowing to the autumn harvest this year, in addition to piloting Soviet new-style farm implements in state-owned farms and demonstration farms, also lent a complete set of new-style farm implements to more than forty mutual aid teams with a relatively good foundation for focused trials in order to gain experience and promote them universally. The new-style farm implements lent by the Northeast People's Government included 13 types such as Soviet seeders, weeders, and harvesters, totaling more than 3,300 pieces. When the new-style farm implements were distributed, farmers in various places generally had concerns because of their complex structure and the need to change some farming methods. To this end, the Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the agricultural and forestry departments of various provinces signed contracts with the mutual aid teams that were piloting the new farm implements, requiring the mutual aid teams to guarantee full use of the implements, while the People's Government was responsible for technical guidance and compensation for losses due to reduced production. As a result, the pilot program achieved universally good results. The efficiency of Soviet new-style farm implements is generally three to five times higher than that of local old farm implements, and all are operated by animal power, which can save a lot of manual labor and allow people to engage in other production. For example, the Qi Baoen mutual aid team in Shuangliao County, Liaoxi Province, used a harvester during the autumn harvest and was able to harvest 43 mu of grain per day, which is equivalent to the work efficiency of fifteen people working all day. The famous labor model Wang Zhentang mutual aid team in Qiyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, used new-style farm implements to reclaim more than 1,000 mu of wasteland this spring, increasing the team's cultivated land by a factor of two compared to the past.
    The new-style farm implements have the conditions for deep plowing and fine cultivation, which has greatly improved farmers' farming methods, thereby increasing yields. The Yang Xianting mutual aid team in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, used new-style farm implements to weed seven times, and soybean production increased by 25 percent compared to last year, and corn production increased by 40 percent. The Han En model mutual aid team in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, harvested an average of 115 jin more grain per mu of crops cultivated with new-style farm implements than farmers using old-style farm implements on 180 mu of farmland.
    In addition, another benefit of using new-style farm implements is that farmers can implement a reasonable division of labor according to the different operating methods of the farm implements, making the best use of their strengths, thereby allowing semi-laborers and unskilled laborers among the farmers to give full play to their abilities.
    The Northeast People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry has now decided to continue piloting new-style farm implements with a focus on farmers next year and to increase the number of trials in order to create more experience.

    苏联新式农具省人力效果好            
    东北重点试用成功
    【新华社讯】东北农村有重点地试用苏联新式农具的工作已获得成功。试用结果证明：苏联新式农具效率很高，能深耕细作，节省人力。
    东北人民政府农林部为提高农业技术发展农业生产和学习苏联先进的农作方法，从今年春耕至秋收期间，除在公营农场和示范农场中试用苏联新式农具外，并将全套新式农具贷给四十几个基础较好的互助组，作重点试用，以便吸取经验，普遍推广。东北人民政府贷放的新式农具有：苏联播种机、除草机、收割机等十三种共三千三百余件。当新式农具发放时，各地农民见其构造复杂，并需要改变一部分耕作方法，普遍存有顾虑。为此，东北农林部和各省农林厅曾分别与试用新农具的互助组签订合同，互助组要保证全部试用，人民政府则负责技术指导并补偿因此而减产的损失。结果，试用效果普遍良好。苏联新式农具的效率一般均比当地旧农具提高三倍至五倍，并且全部都是用畜力操纵，能节省很多人工，从事其他生产。如辽西省双辽县农民齐宝恩互助组，秋收中使用一台收割机，每天能收割四十三亩谷物，等于十五个人工全天的工作效率。黑龙江省启源县著名的劳动模范王振堂互助组，今春用新式农具开荒一千多亩，使该组的耕地较前增加一倍。
    新式农具具备了深耕细作的条件，因而使农民的耕作方法大为改善，从而提高了产量。黑龙江省克山县杨显庭互助组，使用新式农具做到锄草七遍，大豆较去年增产百分之二十五，玉米增产百分之四十。吉林省蛟河县韩恩模范互助组，用新式农具耕作的一百八十亩农作物，平均每亩较使用旧式农具的农民多收一百一十五斤粮食。
    此外，使用新式农具的另一好处是可使农民按农具操作方法的不同实行合理分工，各尽专长，从而使农民中半劳动力和非熟练劳动力得以充分发挥。
    现东北人民政府农林部已决定，明年将继续在农民中有重点的试用新式农具，并增加试用数量，以创造更多的经验。
