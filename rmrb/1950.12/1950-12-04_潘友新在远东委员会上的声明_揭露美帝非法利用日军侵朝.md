    [Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd] TASS, Washington, December 2nd: The Soviet Embassy released to the press Pan Youxin's statement at the Far Eastern Commission on November 30th as follows:

    In its statement on November 2nd, the Soviet delegation pointed out that, according to information obtained by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it has been proven that Japanese troops are participating in the military operations in Korea together with the US troops. At the committee meeting on November 16th, the US representative avoided answering the main points raised in the Soviet delegation's statement, merely mentioning statements by other US officials. These officials groundlessly denied the use of Japanese in the Korean War.

    The Soviet delegation cannot consider the US representative's explanation satisfactory, because even US and Japanese newspapers have proven that the US is using Japanese in the military operations in Korea. For example, *Newsweek* magazine reported on November 13th that Japanese marines participated in the Inchon landing. The *Christian Science Monitor* published a dispatch from its Tokyo correspondent Walker on November 15th, stating that Japanese minesweepers were used as a direct component of the navy operating in Korea, and Japan is increasingly involved in the Korean War. The Japanese newspaper *Japan Times* also reported on October 22nd that rented Japanese minesweeper squadrons participated in combat operations on the east coast of Korea.

    At the same time, US newspapers admit that the military actions of the Japanese in Korea are by no means limited to what has been reported in the newspapers. This shows that the newspapers are unable to report on the other aspects of the utilization of the Japanese in the military operations in Korea, especially regarding the matter of Japanese joining the combat forces.

    US journalist Beichu said in his Tokyo dispatch published in the *Star Evening News* on November 11th: The full course of the Japanese participation in the Korean War has not been made public, for obvious reasons, because Japan is still formally an enemy country. This statement is obviously not without foundation.

    The Soviet delegation pointed out in its statement on November 2nd that the use of Japanese soldiers in the military operations in Korea is a blatant violation of the Potsdam Declaration and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission—the "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan" and the "Prohibition of Military Activities in Japan and Disposal of Japanese Military Equipment." As is well known, these unanimous decisions regarding Japan stipulated the disarmament of Japan and the eradication of Japanese militarism, and strictly prohibited the restoration and maintenance of any Japanese military forces.

    The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to reiterate its statement of November 2nd in this regard, and declares that the Far Eastern Commission should not ignore the aforementioned facts. These facts prove that the unanimous decisions on the eradication of Japanese militarism have been directly violated.

### 潘友新在远东委员会上的声明  揭露美帝非法利用日军侵朝

    潘友新在远东委员会上的声明
    揭露美帝非法利用日军侵朝
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社华盛顿二日讯：苏联大使馆对报界发表潘友新于十一月三十日在远东委员会的声明如下：
    苏联代表团在十一月二日的声明中指出，根据目前朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所得到的情报，已经证明日本军队与美国军队一起共同参加朝鲜的军事行动。十一月十六日委员会开会时，美国代表对于苏联代表团声明中所提出的要点，避而不答，仅仅提到其他美国官员们的声明。这些官员们毫无根据地否认在朝鲜战争中使用日本人。
    苏联代表团不能认为美国代表的解释是满意的，因为甚至美国与日本的报纸都已证明，美国正在朝鲜的军事行动中利用日本人。例如，《新闻周刊》杂志于十一月十三日曾报道日本陆战队曾参加仁川登陆行动。十一月十五日《基督教科学箴言报》上所发表的美国记者华尔克的东京通讯称，日本扫雷艇曾用作在朝鲜作战的海军的直接组成部分，日本正日益卷入朝鲜战争中。日本的报纸《日本时报》十月二十二日也报道说：租用的日本扫雷艇队，曾在朝鲜东部海面参加作战。
    同时，美国报纸承认日本人在朝鲜参加的军事行动绝不仅限于报纸上所已报道的，这就表明了报纸不能够报道在朝鲜的军事行动中还在其他方面利用了日本人，特别是关于日本人加入作战部队中的事情。
    美国记者比区在他发表于十一月十一日《明星晚报》的东京通讯中说：日本人参加朝鲜战争的全盘经过没有公开发表，原因十分明显，因为日本在形式上仍然是一个敌国。这段话显然不是没有根据的。
    苏联代表团已在它十一月二日的声明中指出：在朝鲜的军事行动中使用日本军人是明目张胆地违犯了波茨坦宣言和远东委员会的决定——《日本投降后的对日基本政策》和《禁止在日本的军事活动和处置日本军事装备》。众所周知，这些关于日本的一致协议的决定规定了解除日本武装和肃清日本军国主义，并严禁恢复与保持任何日本军事部队。
    苏联代表团认为在这一方面有必要重申其十一月二日的声明，并宣告远东委员会不应无视上述的事实。这些事实证明了一致协议的关于肃清日本军国主义的决定，已被直接违反。
