    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] TASS, Paris, 28th: Parisian newspapers report on the shocking atrocities being perpetrated by the American aggressors in Korea. On MacArthur's orders, hundreds of thousands of civilians in Seoul have been driven from their homes and escorted by American soldiers and the Li Seung-man gang to southern Korea.
    "The 700,000 civilians whom Li Seung-man ordered to leave Seoul," writes *Liberation*, "are slowly moving south. They are in dire circumstances, exacerbated by the severe cold, and many have already died en route."
