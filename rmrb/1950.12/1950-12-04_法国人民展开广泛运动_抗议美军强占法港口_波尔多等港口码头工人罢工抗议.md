　　Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Comprehensive TASS report: The French people are angrily protesting the US military's occupation of French ports based on the traitorous agreement signed by the Pleven government and the United States. In the port of Bordeaux, which has been occupied by the US military, more than 1,900 dockworkers have been on strike since the afternoon of the 25th to protest the entry of the US military and the arrival of US military supplies at the port, and demanding the immediate withdrawal of the US military. The American ship "Frontenac" has been waiting for several days for this reason and still cannot unload. The residents of Bordeaux warmly support the heroic patriotic actions of the dockworkers.

　　In the port of La Rochelle-La Pallice, which has also been occupied by the US military, dockworkers held a protest strike for several hours on the afternoon of the 25th. On the 27th, they went on strike again.

　　The movement against the US occupation of French seaports has spread throughout France. Prominent political figures and social celebrities in the Gironde province and forty-six public leaders in the Charente-Maritime province have successively lodged protests and announced that they are determined to fight alongside the people of southwestern coastal France to maintain the sovereignty of French ports.

    【新华社二十九日讯】综合塔斯社讯：法国人民愤怒抗议美军根据普利文政府与美国签订的卖国协定而强占法国港口。在为美军强占的波尔多港，一千九百多名码头工人已于二十五日下午起全体罢工，抗议美军进驻和美国军火运抵该港，并要求美军立即撤退。美国轮船“夫隆特那克”号为此已等待了好几天而仍然不得起卸。波尔多居民都热烈支持码头工人英勇的爱国行动。
    在另一个为美军强占的罗舍尔拉巴利斯港，码头工人在二十五日午后举行了几小时的抗议罢工。二十七日，他们又再度罢工。
    反对美国强占法国海港的运动已遍及法国各地。吉伦特省知名的政界人士与社会名流和下夏朗德省的四十六个公众领袖，先后提出抗议，并宣布他们誓与法国西南沿海人民共同为保持法国港口的主权而战斗。
