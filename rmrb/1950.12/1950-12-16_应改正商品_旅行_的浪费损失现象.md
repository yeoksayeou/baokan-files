    Wasteful Losses from Commodity "Travel" Should Be Corrected
    To the Editor:
    In the past eleven months, the China General Merchandise Company, in its various regional branches across Central and Southern China, has discovered instances of goods "traveling" around, resulting in waste and losses during allocation and transportation.
    The company has not paid sufficient attention to enterprise management, failing to plan how to save costs and reduce expenses. There is a great deal of blindness in allocation and transportation, often leading to the phenomenon of goods being transferred back and forth on long journeys. For example, goods from Shanghai destined for Jiujiang and Shangrao could have been directly transported, but the company first transported the goods to Nanchang before forwarding them to Shangrao; goods from Chongqing did not have portions conveniently allocated to Shashi, Yichang, Changsha and other places as needed, but were all transported to Wuhan before being re-allocated; other branches in various regions also have similar phenomena. According to preliminary checks by the Central and Southern China Company, from July to October, within four months, the transportation of sugar from Chongqing failed to conveniently allocate 3,153 packages to Shashi, Yichang, and Changsha along the way. The handling and transportation costs alone wasted 26 million yuan. The unnecessary losses suffered due to long-distance transportation are not even included.
    In order to correct this unreasonable waste, the Central and Southern China Company has decided on the principle of direct transportation, expanding the original destination points limited to the provincial and municipal company locations to twenty-one locations.
    These wasteful phenomena should also attract the attention of relevant departments in various regions.

    应改正商品“旅行”的浪费损失现象
    编辑同志：
    中国百货公司中南区各级公司在十一个月来，调拨运输上，发现货物到处“旅行”、浪费损失的事情。
    该公司对企业化的经营不够重视未能计划如何节省费用，减低成本。在调拨运输上盲目性很大，往往发生调来调去长途旅行现象。如九江、上饶自上海运来的货本可直接运达，而该公司却先将货运至南昌方转上饶；重庆运来的货没有将沙市、宜昌、长沙等地需要的顺便拨给，而统统运到武汉后再行调拨；天津运来河南应用的货，不在开封卸车，却运至武汉后再运回开封；其他各地分公司亦有类似现象。据中南区公司初步检查自七月至十月四个月内，自重庆运糖没有把沙市、宜昌、长沙三地应顺路调拨的三千一百五十三包顺便拨给，仅搬卸费与运费即浪费二千六百万元。因长途运输而遭受的不必要损失还不在内。
    中南区公司为纠正此种不合理的浪费，已决定了直达运输原则，将原来限于各省市公司所在地的运达地点，扩大为二十一处。
    这些浪费现象亦应引起各地有关部门的注意。
