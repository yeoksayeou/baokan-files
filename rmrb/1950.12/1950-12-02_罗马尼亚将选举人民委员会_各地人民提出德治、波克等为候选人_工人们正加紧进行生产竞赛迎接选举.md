Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest dispatch from the Romanian News Agency: The Romanian people will elect people's councils at all levels—the organs of local power—on the 3rd. This election will be conducted according to the new election law passed by the Romanian National Assembly on September 7th. The working people will elect 110,000 representatives based on the principles of universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage to directly manage public affairs. The new election law stipulates that all Romanian citizens who are 18 years of age or older, regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religion, education, occupation, or residence, have the right to vote, and all citizens who are 23 years of age or older have the right to be elected. Before liberation, women, youth, soldiers, and office workers, who were deprived of the right to vote, accounted for nearly half of the country's population. Now they have all obtained the right to vote. The new election law guarantees that the working people can not only nominate candidates through their own political parties and mass organizations but also directly nominate candidates at various election rallies. If the elected representatives fail to faithfully fulfill their tasks, the voters can impeach them. The new election law guarantees the complete freedom of the working people and their organizations to conduct election campaigns and will provide meeting places and printing facilities at the expense of the state.

At election rallies throughout Romania, the working people have nominated Gheorghiu-Dej, Pârvulescu, Luca, Groza, Parhon, and many other shock workers as candidates. The working people are intensely engaged in production emulation to celebrate the elections. Factories and coal mines in Bucharest, Constanța, Galați, and other places have successively reported the news of completing this year's production plans ahead of schedule.

    【新华社一日讯】综合罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚人民将在三日选举各级地方政权机关——人民委员会。此次选举是根据九月七日罗马尼亚国民议会通过的新选举法来进行的，劳动人民将根据普遍、平等、直接、秘密的原则，选出十一万名代表，来直接管理公共事务。新选举法规定：凡年满十八岁的罗马尼亚公民，不分性别、民族、种族、宗教、文化程度、职业或住所，都享有选举权，凡年满二十三岁的公民，都享有被选举权。在解放前，被剥夺了选举权的妇女、青年、军人和机关职员，几占全国人口的半数，现在都得到了选举权。新选举法保证劳动人民不仅能通过自己的政党和群众团体提出候选人，并且可以在各种选举集会上直接提出候选人。如果选出的代表不能忠实完成任务，选民可以予以罢免。新选举法保证劳动人民及其组织进行选举运动的完全自由，并将由国家提供会议场所和印刷等条件。
    在罗马尼亚各地的选举集会上，劳动人民已纷纷提出乔治乌——德治、波克、卢加、格罗查、巴洪及其他许多突击工人为候选人。劳动人民正紧张进行庆祝选举的生产竞赛，布加勒斯特、康斯坦萨和加拉兹等地的工厂和煤矿，已相继传来提前完成本年生产计划的消息。
