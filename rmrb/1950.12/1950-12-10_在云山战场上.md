    The night after the Battle of Unsan ended, we drove through the rain to the battlefield. Here, raging fires still burned: mountain tops were burning, vehicles were burning, villages and towns were burning—the American invading army used fire to destroy everything around the battlefield!
    
    As our vehicle passed through Unsan Street, we witnessed a heartbreaking scene: a town of one to two thousand households had been reduced to a pile of black ashes! The stench of burning permeated the air. Through the flickering flames, we saw the corpses of men, women, and children who had been killed and burned. But right next to the bodies of these peaceful residents lay the enemy's abandoned tanks, artillery, vehicles, piles of ammunition, and the enemy's corpses. These inhuman brutes, just a few days ago, were still shouting about "occupying all of Korea before Thanksgiving (November 23rd)," but today, under the iron fist of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, they were utterly defeated and lost their lives!
    
    While inspecting the battlefield, commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army told us many heroic battle stories, and also told us that the enemy was very cowardly in the face of the Volunteer Army's warriors.
    
    The battle proceeded according to the original plan. All units successfully completed the encirclement of the enemy, and then, almost at the same time, many sharp knives pierced the enemy. The night was pitch black, and the mountains were rugged. The soldiers crossed mountains, ditches, and fortifications, charging forward despite the enemy's dense artillery fire, encouraging each other: "Comrades! Charge! Airplanes have no eyes at night, and howitzers can't be used as bayonets!" The rapid assault disoriented the enemy, and the battle took place in many corners.
    
    At the beginning of the battle, the 3rd Battalion of a certain regiment was ordered to clear the enemy from the flank and outflank them from the rear. They used light machine guns, grenades, and bayonets to clear a path forward. They charged for more than thirty li, crossing more than a dozen large and small mountain tops. The soldiers advanced through the trees and thorns while clearing out the enemy. The American soldiers were stunned by this courageous maneuver; many American soldiers were thrown down the mountain before they could even get out of their down comforters. When the 9th Company charged to the bottom of a mountain, a group of American soldiers did not realize who was coming. They hurriedly made way for the soldiers and shook hands with them, but in an instant, guns rang out in front of them! In the dense gunfire, these invading soldiers always yelled and screamed, some cried loudly in fear. The only word that could be understood was "Mama!" Many people were shouting, "Mama!"
    
    The 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of a certain regiment also used the same rapid action to attack the enemy. In just a few hours, with twenty casualties, they completely wiped out a company of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, killing more than eighty and capturing fourteen. At ten o'clock the next morning, the enemy dispatched five tanks, more than six hundred infantry, and heavy artillery from seventy li away to counterattack the hilltop defended by the 1st Company. Airplanes were overhead, heavy artillery was in the distance, and tanks were at the foot of the mountain. The hilltop was hit everywhere throughout the day, but the soldiers still did not leave their battle positions. Finally, the enemy sprinkled gasoline on the mountain and dropped rockets and incendiary bombs. The entire mountain was engulfed in flames. At this time, the soldiers temporarily retreated to the foot of the mountain and waited. When the enemy thought that the company had been burned to ashes and arrogantly ordered the infantry to charge up the mountain, our soldiers immediately jumped up, charged forward with bayonets, and the enemy rolled back down the mountain again. In the end, the enemy, fearing encirclement, had to retreat along the original road.
    
    Our frontal assault drove the enemy out of Unsan, the outflanking troops cut off the enemy's retreat, and the reinforcements were driven back. A large number of enemies were compressed on a section of the highway southwest of Unsan. Facing the prospect of total annihilation, the enemy made a desperate struggle. They blindly fired heavy artillery in all directions, and the fifty-five-ton heavy tanks, like living bunkers, ran around protecting their soldiers and attacking our firing points. In order to quickly eliminate them, the soldiers loudly proposed: "Comrades! Attack the tanks! The time to make merit has come!" An amazing event occurred at this moment: Wang You, a soldier from the 6th Platoon of the 3rd Company of a certain regiment, jumped onto the turret of a tank and fought the tank single-handedly; Lu Liangshi, a young soldier from the 7th Company of a certain regiment, ran to the tank with two explosive packs in his arms, stuffed the explosive packs into the tracks, causing the steel monster to jump only once in a burst of smoke and fire before lying there motionless. Soldier Cui Dianfu, wounded in the left shoulder, continued to fight. He climbed onto a tank, used a bayonet to pry open the turret cover, and killed the driver inside the tank. These soldiers' actions turned the tanks into prisoners here.
    
    There are many similar heroic stories: for example, when annihilating enemy infantry, Squad Leader Zhang Youjun led a soldier and chased five American soldiers for more than two li; machine gunner Gao Sheng charged at the enemy with a light machine gun like he was carrying a submachine gun. These heroic actions terrified the enemy. They were stunned and stood there like wooden figures waiting to be beaten. Similar stories appeared in every corner of the battle and were passed around as jokes on the battlefield.
    
    When soldier Wang You climbed onto a tank, he suddenly noticed five American soldiers crawling not far from the tank. They stared at Wang You fighting the tank alone, without firing a shot. After Wang You finished with the tank and came back, he saw the five American soldiers still crawling there like toads. He attacked the five American soldiers alone again. Only then did those guys think of running, but they were all wiped out. One night, the regimental commander of a certain regiment led two signal soldiers to a small hilltop to command the troops. He ordered the two signal soldiers to search around, and he found a place to sit down. As soon as he sat down, he saw two round objects shining on the opposite side. Upon closer inspection, they were two American soldiers wearing steel helmets, head to head, holding automatic rifles, and upon closer inspection, the muzzles were pointing at his chest. The regimental commander, not carrying a pistol, called to the signal soldiers: "Hey! Come over and see what this is!" The signal soldiers confiscated the guns of these two guys. When annihilating the enemy's infantry, many soldiers rushed to the vehicles and saw many behinds, as the American soldiers hid their heads! Some immediately knelt down and surrendered their guns as soon as they saw our soldiers arrive. Soldier Li Lianxian rushed to a depression and lay down, immediately finding two American soldiers next to him. He quickly jumped over to seize their guns. When he was fighting with another American soldier, the other one stood there watching, and both were wiped out by him alone!
    
    Our soldiers used such tenacious and courageous fighting actions to annihilate the enemy in every corner. Those thugs, armed to the teeth, relying on heavy weapons and automatic firearms, and shouting about marching to the Yalu River, suffered a heavy blow here. After the battle, the soldiers talked about the stories of their first engagement. They said, "These soldiers look big and have good weapons, but as soon as they meet us, they act like cowards!" Some soldiers, seeing that the surroundings were still burning, asked their superiors for combat missions again. They said, "This battle was not enough. In the future, we must fight bigger battles and wipe out more American invading troops!"

    在云山战场上
    东北日报随中国人民志愿军记者  顾雷、吴少琦
    云山战斗结束的第二天晚上，我们乘着汽车、冒着雨赶到了战场上。这里仍然烧着熊熊大火：山头在燃烧、汽车在燃烧、村镇在燃烧——美国侵略军用火毁灭了战场周围的一切！
    我们的汽车穿过云山街的时候，看到了使人酸心的惨景：一两千户的镇子变成一堆黑灰了！到处荡着焦臭气味。透过仍在跳动的火光，我们看见了被打死、烧死的男男女女和孩子们的尸体。但是，就是在这些和平居民的尸体旁边，躺着匪徒们丢下的坦克、大炮、汽车、成堆的炮弹和匪徒们的尸体。就是这些没有人性的家伙，在前两天，还高叫着“感恩节（十一月二十三日）以前全部占领朝鲜”，而今天，在中国人民志愿部队的铁拳下，被打得落花流水，丢掉了自己的生命！
    在参观战场的时候，中国人民志愿军的指挥员和战士们向我们讲述了许多英勇的战斗故事，同时也告诉了我们：匪徒们在志愿部队的勇士面前是非常怯懦的。
    战斗是按原订计划进行的。各个部队顺利的完成了对敌人的包围，而后，差不多在同一个时间里，有许多把尖刀向敌人插去。夜是漆黑的，山峦崎岖不平，战士们越过大山、沟渠、工事，冒着敌人密集的炮火冲下去，互相鼓励着：“同志们！冲啊！夜间的飞机是没有眼睛的，榴弹炮不能当刺刀用！”神速的猛扑，把敌人打乱了，战斗在许多个角落里进行着。
    某团三营在战斗开始的时候，奉命由侧翼扫清敌人，向敌人背后迂回。他们用轻机枪、手榴弹、刺刀为自己开辟前进的道路。一冲就是三十多里路，十几个大小山头，战士们在树丛和荆棘中间一面肃清敌人一面前进，美国兵被这勇猛的动作惊呆了；不少的美国兵还没钻出鸭绒被子，就滚到山下去了。当九连冲到一个山底下时，一队美国兵并未意识到来的是什么人，慌忙的给战士们让路，并且和战士们握手，但刹那间，枪就在他们的面前响起来了！在密集的枪声中，这些侵略军的兵士们，总是哇里哇啦的叫唤，有的吓的大声哭起来，能够听懂的只有一句，不少人在叫：“妈妈！”
    某团一营一连，也是用同样快的动作，向敌人进攻的。差不多用几个小时的时间，以二十名伤亡整整吃掉了美骑一师的一个连。打死八十多个，俘虏十四个。第二天上午十点钟，敌人从七十里以外的地方调来了五辆坦克，六百多步兵，配属了重炮，向一连固守的山头进行反击。战士们头上是飞机，远处是重炮，山脚下是坦克，一天中，山头上各处都被打着了，战士们仍不离开战斗岗位。最后，敌人将山上洒上汽油，投下火箭弹、烧夷弹，整个山上燃起了熊熊大火，这时战士们暂时退到山脚下等着，当敌人以为这个连队被火烧光，狂妄的指挥着步兵冲上山头的时候，我们的战士马上跳起来，端着刺刀反扑上去，匪徒们一看见明晃晃的刺刀又都滚下山去了。最后，敌人怕被包围，不得不从原来的路上退回去。
    我们正面的攻击将敌人逐出了云山，迂回的部队切断了敌人的退路，增援的又被打回去了，大批的敌人被压缩在云山西南的一段公路上。面对着全部被歼的前途，匪徒们作垂死的挣扎。他们盲目地用重炮向四面射击，五十五吨的重坦克像一座活的碉堡，跑来跑去卫护着他们的兵士，并且向我们的火力点攻击，为了很快地消灭掉它，战士们响亮地提出：“同志们！向坦克攻击，立功的时候到了！”惊人的事迹就在这个时候出现了：某团三连六班战士王有一个人跳上了坦克的塔顶，只身与坦克搏斗；某团七连小战士鲁良士，一个人抱着两个爆破筒，跑到了坦克跟前，将爆破筒塞到轮带中去，使这个钢铁的怪物在一阵烟火中只跳了一下，便躺在那里不动了。战士崔殿福左肩上负了伤仍然坚持战斗，他曾爬上坦克，用刺刀撬开炮塔的盖子，把驾驶员打死在坦克里，这些战士们的行为使坦克在这里都当了俘虏。
    类似这样英勇的故事是非常多的：比方在歼灭敌人步兵的时候，班长张友君带着一个战士，曾将五个美国兵追了二里多路；机枪射手高升像端着冲锋枪一样的端着轻机枪冲向敌人。这些英雄的行为，把那些匪徒们的胆都吓碎了。他们昏头昏脑地像木头人一样地在那里等着挨打。这样的故事同样出现在每一个战斗的角落，在战场上被当成笑话传流着。
    当战士王有爬上一辆坦克时，突然发现在离坦克不远的地方爬着五个美国兵，他们瞪着眼看着王有一个人与坦克搏斗，一枪不放。王有打完坦克后回来，看见这五个美国兵仍然像蛤蚂一样爬在那里，他一个人又向那五个美国兵扑去。这时，那些家伙才想到跑，结果都被消灭了。一个夜晚，某团团长带着两个通讯兵到一个小山头上指挥部队。他命令两个通讯员到周围搜索一下，自己便找个地方坐下来。刚坐下，看见对面有两个圆家伙发亮，仔细一看，是两个美国兵戴着钢盔，头靠着头，端着自动步枪坐在那里，又仔细一看，枪口正对着自己的胸口。团长因为没带手枪，便叫通讯员：“喂！快过来看看这是什么玩意？”通讯员缴了这两个家伙的枪。在消灭敌人的步兵时，有不少战士冲到汽车跟前，看见了许多屁股，美国兵都把头藏起来了！有的一看见我们的战士到了，立刻跪下缴上了自己的枪。战士李连先冲到一个洼地刚卧下，马上发现身旁有两个美国兵，他迅速跳过去夺他们的枪，当他与另外一个美国兵搏斗时，另外一个呆在那里看着，这样都被他一个人消灭了！
    我们的战士，就是用这样顽强、勇猛的战斗动作，在每个角落里歼灭敌人的。那些武装到牙齿、依靠着重武器、自动火器，高叫着进军鸭绿江的匪徒们，在这里遭到了沉重的打击。战斗之后，战士们纷纷谈论着第一个交手仗中的故事。他们说：“这些兵看起来个子很大，拿的武器也不错，但一碰到咱们就装狗熊了！”有些战士看到周围仍在燃烧的时候，又向上级请求战斗任务了，他们说：“这次仗打的还不过瘾，将来一定要打更大的仗，消灭更多的美国侵略军！”
