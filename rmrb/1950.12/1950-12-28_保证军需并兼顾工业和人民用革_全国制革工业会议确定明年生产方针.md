Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: The National Leather Industry Conference determined that the production guidelines for the national leather industry in 1951 are to guarantee military supplies while also taking into account the supply of leather for industrial and civilian use. Because there is currently a shortage of draft cattle in the country, and agricultural production is in urgent need of restoration and development, how to rationally use the limited supply of cowhide is an important issue the conference addressed in solving the raw material supply problem. To make up for the shortage of cowhide, the conference advocated the extensive use of sheepskin, horsehide, mule hide, camel hide, and miscellaneous hides such as pigskin. Among these, the extensive use of pigskin is particularly important. Because pigskin is a huge national resource, and there are no technical problems in using it to make leather, and the Northeast already has a lot of experience; but in order for pigskin to be fully utilized, extensive publicity and education work must be carried out to gradually change the people's habit of eating pigskin. On the issue of raw material supply, the conference drafted five drafts, including a cowhide procurement plan for next year, cowhide procurement methods, and methods for using pigskin to make leather.

Based on next year's production guidelines and raw material supply situation, the conference formulated a plan for the amount of cowhide needed for industrial and civilian use in various regions of the country next year, and determined that the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government will uniformly control and make dynamic adjustments. Regarding the processing and ordering of military leather goods for next year, the conference determined that the Logistics and Military Supplies Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government and the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government will decide after consultation, and distribute them in a unified and rational manner in accordance with the principles of considering both public and private interests, taking care of progressives, and taking care of the overall situation.

The conference also discussed and made some decisions on issues such as the management of the leather industry and finished product specification standards.

This conference was jointly convened by the Logistics and Military Supplies Department of the Central Military Commission and the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central Government. It started on December 5th and ended on the 17th. In addition to representatives from the central government and major administrative regions, provinces, and municipal government departments, representatives from public and private leather factories from various regions also participated in the conference.

    保证军需并兼顾工业和人民用革
    全国制革工业会议确定明年生产方针
    【新华社二十六日讯】全国制革工业会议确定一九五一年全国制革工业的生产方针是保证军需并兼顾工业用革和民用革的供应。因为目前国内耕牛缺乏，而农业生产又亟待恢复和发展，所以如何合理地使用有限的牛皮是会议在解决原料供应中的一个重要问题。为弥补牛皮的不足，会议提倡大量采用羊皮、马皮、骡皮、骆驼皮以及猪皮等杂皮。其中对猪皮的广泛利用尤为重要。因猪皮是国家巨大富源，以之制革在技术上没有问题，东北已有不少经验；但要使猪皮充分被利用，必须进行广泛的宣传教育工作，以逐步扭转人民吃猪皮的习惯。在原料供应问题上，会议拟定了明年牛皮收购计划、牛皮收购办法、利用猪皮制革办法等五个草案。
    根据明年生产方针和原料供应情况，会议制订了明年全国各地区工业用和民用所需牛皮的计划，并确定由中央人民政府轻工业部统一掌握，机动调整。关于明年军需皮革用品的加工和定货工作，会议确定由中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会后勤军需部与中央人民政府轻工业部会商决定后，按照公私兼顾，照顾进步，照顾全面的原则，统筹合理地进行分配。
    会议对制革工业的经营管理和成品规格标准等问题，亦曾进行讨论，并有所决定。
    此次会议由中央军委后勤军需部和中央轻工业部联合召开。从十二月五日开始，十七日结束。除中央和各大行政区、省、市政府部门代表外，各地公私营制革厂亦有代表参加了会议。
