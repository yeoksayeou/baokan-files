[Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to maintain public order, keep streets clean, and prevent the occurrence of rabies, has recently formulated the "Beijing City (including suburbs) Domestic Dog Registration Management Measures." These measures stipulate that all domestic dogs raised by residents of the city that are more than two months old, or dogs brought into the city by travelers staying for more than one month, must be registered in accordance with these measures. The Hygiene Engineering Bureau will issue a dog tag (collecting a nominal fee for the cost) to be hung around the neck, valid for one year. At the time of registration, a rabies vaccination will be administered, and thereafter, one or two vaccinations will be given annually, and a vaccination certificate will be issued. If the owner's address changes or there is any change in the dog's status, the Outdoor Dog Disposal Center should be notified for record-keeping. In the event of a rabies outbreak, the Outdoor Dog Disposal Center should be immediately notified to arrange for the dog to be captured and killed. If anyone is bitten by a rabid dog, the Outdoor Dog Disposal Center should be immediately notified to inform the Public Health Bureau to promptly send personnel to administer injections and disinfect. After the registration measures are implemented, any dogs scattered in the streets without registration tags or unattended will be regarded as stray dogs and captured first. Registered dogs, if the owner allows them to roam freely in the streets, urinate and defecate indiscriminately, chase and bark, or bite pedestrians and obstruct traffic, will also be captured. Captured dogs will be kept at the Paozi River Outdoor Dog Disposal Center for three days. If no owner claims them, they will be electrocuted. Registration will begin on the 11th of this month; the capture of stray dogs will begin on the 16th. Registration locations are: Outdoor Dog Disposal Center, No. 1 Paozi River, East City (side entrance); Sino-Western Veterinary Clinic, No. 63 East Avenue of Jiaodaokou, North City; Jichu Veterinary Hospital, West Side of Xisi North Avenue, West City; Veterinary Work Station of Beijing Agricultural University, West Exit of the Temple of Heaven, South City.
