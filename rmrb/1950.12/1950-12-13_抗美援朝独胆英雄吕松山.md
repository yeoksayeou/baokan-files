    Lü Songshan, Lone Hero in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Xiao Qun
    Comrade Lü Songshan is from Muping County, Shandong Province. He was originally a technician in an oil factory. After the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, he resolutely joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and became a veritable "combat squad leader" in a combat company, a title he felt most honored to have!
    More than ten miles southwest of the outskirts of Yunshan, the surrounding area is full of gradually taller mountain peaks, with an open space of five or six miles in the middle. In the center of the open space is a north-south highway leading to the enemy, and a winding river flows from the southwestern edge, passing through the open space. Less than a mile east on the riverbed, there is a bridge, the place where the highway and the bridge intersect. In the southwest open area of this intersection, two or three hundred American soldiers were building fortifications along both sides of the highway, and tanks were used as shields at the entrances and exits of the main fortifications. Cars were parked in twos and threes on the highway, dragging long gun barrels behind them. During the day, planes circled in the sky for cover.
    As dusk approached on October 21st, the battlefield, which had been filled with the clouds of war and constant gunfire for days, was eerily silent.
    "Bang!" With a sound, a meteor-like flash of fire flew from the ground into the air, pointing to a certain place. This was the sound and light that some people's eyes and ears had been waiting for a long time – the attack signal.
    Following the fire, artillery fire flew from all directions like snowflakes toward the enemy's positions. The American soldiers now seemed to have lost their souls! Some were lying on the ground, wishing they could bury their heads underground, some were crawling under the wheels of cars, and some were climbing into fortifications, not daring to show their heads. Some even ran off without caring about their hats. It was truly an indescribable scene of embarrassment.
    From the mountains less than a thousand meters away, more than a dozen agile soldiers, under the cover of artillery fire, passed through the enemy's machine gun blockade and quickly approached the riverbank on the edge of the open space. This was the leading assault squad of the attacking force. The first man at the front of the squad was Comrade Lü Songshan, the leader of the first combat squad. The task of this squad was to directly attack a core fortification next to the central highway, just like a sharp knife piercing the enemy's heart. Then, the brotherly units would divide and eliminate the entire area of the enemy. This task was arduous because penetrating the enemy's heart would be subject to fire suppression from all directions. Not only would supplies be difficult, but casualties would also be high. However, they had no time to consider these problems. Under the command of the squad leader and the leadership of Comrade Lü Songshan, the assault squad quickly and safely approached a place less than one hundred meters from the bridge, which was the shortest route to the target – three hundred meters.
    Comrade Lü Songshan climbed onto the riverbed without the slightest hesitation, encouraging: "Comrades! The time to make meritorious contributions has come!" Under his actions and encouragement, everyone jumped onto the open space together and launched a decisive attack on the enemy! At this time, the artillery fire covering them, and the bullets fired by the enemy from all directions, raised bursts of dust and smoke on the open space. The soldiers of the assault squad, braving the rain of bullets and passing through the dust and smoke, advanced in the battle, replenishing ammunition from the enemy corpses strewn across the field!
    When heroes have bullets, it's like a tiger growing wings! The enemy's bullets could not stop their advance! In the advance, one, two… five comrades fell, wounded, but they knew that this was the enemy's death throes! The closer they got to the enemy, the more confident they were of victory. With a cry of "Forward!" the enemy's core fortification was right in front of the heroes.
    Strange! There was not a single enemy in the fortification. Only a tank, riddled with scars, was still lying at the entrance of the cave. Nothing unusual could be seen on the ground, and no trace of an enemy escaping could be found. Only a car covered with a tent beside the road contained something unknown. The squad leader walked towards the car, wanting to search it. The other three were searching the surroundings of the fortification. "Pat pat pat…" A burst of submachine gun fire rang out, and squeaking bullets flew towards the car. The squad leader was wounded in the shoulder. Comrade Lü Songshan raised his submachine gun and fired a threatening burst at the enemy without aiming! Sure enough, two enemies on the other side of the highway, only ten meters away, ducked their heads into the ground. Lü Songshan, in his anxious wisdom, rushed forward before the enemy could look up, and launched a series of fierce attacks! The two enemies fell. When Comrade Lü Songshan saw the scene in front of him, he couldn't help but feel anxious and flustered, his head covered in sweat!
    It turned out that what was in front of him was a more than ten-meter-long square fortification – a resting shelter, dug more than two meters deep from the ground level, covered with a tent and a thin layer of soil, camouflaged to look like the ground. The two enemies who had been killed were at the entrance and exit of this fortification, and the inside was full of American soldiers shouting "Wah! Wah!" Lü Songshan saw that the bullets in his magazine were about to run out. If the firing stopped, the enemy might rush out. He quickly switched the selector to semi-automatic, holding the gun in his right hand and firing single shots to block the entrance, while his left hand took out a grenade, bit open the cap with his teeth, and also bit down on the safety pin ring. In this way, he cooperated with his teeth and hands to throw the grenade into the entrance of the cave. With a bang, the enemy only screamed. Taking advantage of the moment of the grenade explosion, he quickly replaced the magazine, and a burst of gunfire was followed by a grenade. Without interruption, one, two… He threw all four grenades he was carrying, but the enemies inside the fortification were still groaning! At this time, he had only one last shout: "Cover me! Cover me!"
    However, the two comrades on the other side of the highway were dealing with several enemy counterattacks and could not spare any effort. Only the squad leader, wounded in the shoulder, got up and leaned against the hood of the car, firing shot after shot at the entrance of the cave, covering him and cheering him on! In an instant, he found four grenades from the enemy corpses. He threw the seventh grenade in the same way, alternating between gunshots and grenades. In the distance from the tent seam, a white towel was extended – a sign of surrender. Comrade Lü Songshan held a submachine gun with a full magazine in his right hand and a grenade in his left hand, using his thumb to lift the safety pin ring, preparing for any eventuality. Only then did he stop firing and shout, "Okay! Okay! Very good! Very good!" After a few shouts, the enemies skillfully dropped their guns from the tent seam, one, two… dozens of guns, all with the butt facing up, outside the fortification. Then, raising their hands, one, two… thirty-odd American soldiers walked out of the cave in the same posture, walking along the direction he pointed to the highway. Finally, there were still a few particularly timid cowards, seeing a grenade with the cap removed waving in his hand, scared and stuttering, trembling and not daring to walk out of the cave. At this time, Lü Songshan was too excited. He stood up and waved to them, but suddenly, with a "hiss!" a bullet flew from the nearby position, hitting Comrade Lü Songshan's left arm. His eyes flashed with fire, and sweat poured down his face. He calmly persisted: "Okay! Okay! Very good! Very good!" He kept calling the last few American soldiers out, handing them over to the brotherly units that followed up. He could no longer support himself and fainted. When he woke up, the surrounding gunshots were very loud. He knew that this was the brotherly units finally annihilating the enemy. He struggled to get up, left the line of fire, and was carried down by the comrades in the battlefield medical service.

    抗美援朝独胆英雄吕松山
    萧群
    吕松山同志是山东牟平县人，原先是一个油脂工厂的技术工人。美国帝国主义者发动侵略朝鲜战争以后，他便毅然参加了中国人民志愿部队，在一个战斗连队里，当了一个名符其实的“战斗小组长”，这是他感到最光荣的一个称号！
    云山外围西南十多华里的地方，四周都是逐渐高大的山巅，中间有一块五六华里的开阔地，开阔地的中央，是一条横贯南北的通敌公路，一条蜿蜒曲折的河流，从西南的边缘，通过开阔地，向东流不到一华里的河床上，有一座桥梁，这就是公路与桥梁交叉的地方。在这个交叉点的西南开阔地的地区里，有两三百个美国兵，沿着公路的两侧，构筑着工事，在主要工事的出进口，还用坦克在那里作挡箭牌，公路上停着三三两两的汽车后面，拖着长长的炮身。白天里，飞机在天空上来回掩护。
    十月二十一日快接近黄昏的时候，几天来战云弥漫，枪声不绝的战地上，呈现一片沉寂。
    “碰！”一声响，一颗流星似的火光，从地面飞舞到空中，又指向一个地方。这就是一部分人的眼睛和耳朵所盼待已久的响声和光亮——攻击信号。
    随着火光而起的炮火，从四面八方像雪花一样的飞向敌人的阵地上。美国兵现在都像失掉灵魂一样！有的伏在地上，头恨不得埋到地下去，有的钻到汽车轮子下，有的爬进工事去，头也不敢露。有的跑掉了帽子也不顾，这真是一幅难以形容的狼狈相。
    从远处不到一千公尺的山地里，有十多个身手敏捷的战士，在炮火的掩护下，通过了敌人机枪的封锁线，很快地便接近到开阔地边缘的河沿里。这就是攻击部队最先头的一个突击班。班前头的第一名，便是突击班里第一战斗小组长吕松山同志。这个班的任务，是要直接攻击敌人中心公路旁的一个核心工事，正好像一把尖刀直刺到敌人心脏一样，然后兄弟部队再把整个地区的敌人分割消灭。这个任务是艰巨的，因为突入敌人心腹时，是会受到敌人各方面的火力制压的，不但补给有困难，伤亡也会大。可是，这些问题，他们无暇考虑，突击班在班长的指挥和吕松山同志的领导下，很快而安全地接近到距离桥梁不到一百公尺的地方，这正是距攻击目标最捷径的地方——三百多公尺。
    吕松山同志没有丝毫犹豫地爬上了河床，一边鼓励着：“同志们！立功的时候到了！”大家在他的行动和鼓励下，便一起翻身跳上开阔地，向敌人展开决定性的攻击！这时候，给自己掩护的炮火，和敌人从各方面打来的枪弹，在开阔地上冒起一阵阵的灰尘和烟雾。突击班的战士们，冒着弹雨，穿过尘烟，在战斗中前进，从死尸遍野的敌人身上补充弹药！
    英雄们有了枪弹，好比老虎长了翅膀！敌人的枪弹，那能挡得住他们的前进！在前进中一个两个……五个同志都躺下了，负伤了，可是他们知道：这是敌人的垂死挣扎！愈接近敌人，胜利便愈有把握。一声：“前进！”敌人的核心工事，就摆在英雄们的面前了。
    奇怪！工事里一个敌人也没有，只有一辆遍体鳞伤的坦克仍然躺在洞门口，地面上看不出一点异样，也找不到一个敌人逃跑的踪影，只有路旁一辆盖着帐篷的汽车上，不知道是什么东西。班长走向汽车，想搜查一下。其余三个人正搜索着工事的周围，“拍拍拍……”一阵冲锋枪响，吱吱吱……响的子弹便飞到汽车上，班长的肩头负伤了，吕松山同志端起冲锋枪，“拍拍拍……”来不及瞄准便给敌人一阵威吓的射击！果然，不过十多公尺在公路那边的两个敌人，头缩到地里面去了。吕松山情急生智，不等敌人抬头，他便抢上前去，接连一阵痛击！这两个敌人倒下了。吕松山同志一见眼前的情景，不由得心急发忙，满头只冒汗！
    原来他面前是一个十多公尺长方的一个工事——休息掩体，从地平面掘下两公尺多深，上面盖着帐篷，和薄薄的一层土，伪装得同地面一样。这两个被打死的敌人，正在这个工事的进出口，洞里面满是美国兵，“哇！哇！”的叫。吕松山眼瞅自己弹夹的子弹快打光，如果射击中断了，说不定敌人就会往外冲，他急忙把开关拨到点发上，右手端枪一发一发的作点放封锁洞口，左手掏出手榴弹，用牙咬开弹盖，又咬住拉火圈，这样齿手合作的把手榴弹投进洞口去。轰的一声，只炸得敌人乱叫唤。趁着手榴弹爆炸的一刹那，又迅速换上了新弹夹，一阵枪响连着的便是一声手榴弹。没有间断的一颗两颗……他身上的四颗手榴弹投完了，工事里面的敌人还在乱咕噜！这时候他只有最后喊：“快掩护！快掩护！”
    可是，在公路那边的两个战友，正在应付几个敌人的反击，根本无法分身，只有肩头负伤的班长爬起来依托在汽车头上，一枪一枪的向洞口射击，替他掩护，助威！他在瞬间，从敌人死尸上，找到了四颗手榴弹，他照样地一阵枪一阵弹的投到第七颗手榴弹，在帐篷缝的远处，伸出来一条白色的毛巾，——投降的记号。吕松山同志右手端着满匣子弹的冲锋枪，左手拿着手榴弹，用大拇指顶起拉火圈，作好了应变的准备后，才停止了射击招呼着：“欧开！欧开！顶好！顶好！”几声招呼后，敌人很有经验地把枪托朝上从帐篷缝里一根两根……数十根枪都丢到工事外，接着举起双手一个两个……三十几个同一姿势的美国兵鱼贯地走到洞外，顺着他手指的方向走到公路上。最后还有几个特别胆小的怕死鬼，眼见一颗揭开弹盖的手榴弹在他手上挥动，吓得吞吞吐吐，抖抖擞擞的不敢走出洞外。这时候，吕松山太兴奋了，他站了起来，用手去招唤他们，猛不防，“嘶！”的一声，从旁的阵地上飞来一颗子弹，正打中吕松山同志的左臂上，他眼睛一冒火花，顿时汗如雨下，他镇静地坚持着：“欧开！欧开！顶好！顶好！”一直把最后几个美国兵叫出来，交给跟上来的兄弟部队后，他已经支持不住地昏倒了。等醒过来，四围的枪声响得很利害，他知道这是兄弟部队在最后地歼灭敌人，他好容易挣扎了起来，离开火线，由战地的救护同志们把他抬下来。
