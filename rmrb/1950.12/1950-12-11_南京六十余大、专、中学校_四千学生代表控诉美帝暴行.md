    Over Sixty Universities, Colleges, and Middle Schools in Nanjing
    Four Thousand Student Representatives Accuse American Imperialism of Atrocities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Nanjing held an anti-American imperialism aggression crimes accusation meeting with more than sixty universities, colleges and middle schools and more than four thousand student representatives, accusing American imperialism of its atrocities in China and its cultural invasion influence; and vowed to be ready to respond to the motherland's call at any time and contribute everything they have.
    The participating schools that took part in the accusation meeting included private Jinling University, Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, private Hongguang Middle School, Mingde Girls' High School, Huiwen Girls' High School, Zhonghua Girls' High School (the above are schools founded in China by imperialism through the church), National Nanjing University, Nanjing University Affiliated High School, Municipal Second Middle School, Eighth Middle School, and other public schools, as well as family members of victims who had their relatives killed by the U.S. military. A total of twenty-three people made accusations at the meeting. They exposed the bloody facts of American imperialism's inhuman insults and killings of Chinese people and the harm of enslavement education. Su Qizhen, a student from the Municipal Second Girls' Middle School, said that she saw with her own eyes a U.S. soldier kick a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry and die. Student Hu Yanzhang accused the U.S. of killing his five-year-old sister under an American jeep. He said: When his sister was about to run across the street, an American devil drove a car and knocked her more than ten feet away; and the American devil did not stop, cruelly running over the child's body. Tao Jialin, a student at Jinling University, severely criticized her pro-American thinking at the meeting. She said that she had studied in church schools since she was a child, and under the influence of imperialist enslavement education, she admired the United States. She had thought: Since the Chinese cannot do things well, it would be better to belong to the United States. She often hated that she was not American. After two accusation meetings, the iron facts educated her. She finally woke up. She said sadly and angrily: "I forgot that I am Chinese. American imperialists are trying to educate our young generation into America’s echo bug." Then Chen Xingzhi, a family member of a victim, was invited to speak, and he called on the youth to avenge his dead son. He said: We must not forget the blood debt owed by American imperialism. American imperialism bombed my son to death, but did not bomb me to death, did not bomb the hundreds of millions of Chinese people to death. We must take revenge. The slogans "Turn grief into strength" and "Actively participate in military schools to consolidate national defense" resounded throughout the venue. Every participant solemnly raised their hands and vowed to contribute everything to defend the motherland and oppose American imperialist aggression. Finally, Guo Jiaqiang, chairman of the Nanjing Student Union, called on all students in the city to work hard to support the just struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers; participate in national defense construction, work hard to learn military technology; be vigilant and prevent bandits and special agents from destroying schools; and actively launch school protection movements.

    南京六十余大、专、中学校
    四千学生代表控诉美帝暴行
    【新华社南京九日电】南京市六十四个大、专、中学校，四千余学生代表，九日举行反对美帝侵略罪行控诉大会，控诉美帝在华暴行及其文化侵略影响；并宣誓随时准备响应祖国的号召，贡献出自己的一切。
    参加大会控诉的有私立金陵大学、金陵女子文理学院、私立弘光中学、明德女中、汇文女中、中华女中（以上是帝国主义通过教会在华创办的学校）、国立南京大学、南大附中、市立第二中学、第八中学等公立学校等校代表以及曾经被美军杀害了自己亲人的被难家属。会上共有二十三人进行了控诉。他们揭露了美帝国主义毫无人性地侮辱与杀死中国人的血腥事实和奴化教育的毒害。市立第二女子中学学生苏麒珍说到她眼看到美军把一个孕妇踢得流产以致身死。学生胡衍章控诉他五岁的妹妹惨死在美国吉普车下的情形。他说：当他妹妹正准备跑过街时，美国鬼子驶着一部汽车，将她冲出一丈多远；而且美国鬼子竟不停车，残酷地从这个幼儿的身上辗过去。金陵大学学生陶嘉林，在会上极其沉痛地批判了自己的崇美思想。她说，她自小就在教会学校里读书，在帝国主义奴化教育的影响下，她崇拜美国。她曾想过：中国人既然办不好事，倒不如归到美国去办。她常常恨自己不是美国人。经过两次控诉会以后，铁的事实教育了她。她才觉悟起来。她悲愤地说：“我忘记了自己是中国人。美帝国主义者企图把我们年青的一代教育成美国的应声虫。”接着被难家属陈性之被邀讲话，他呼吁青年人为他死难的儿子报仇。他说：我们不能忘记美帝国主义欠下的血债，美帝国主义炸死了我的儿子，但没有炸死我，没有炸死千千万万中国人民，我们要报仇。全场响彻了“化悲愤为力量”、“积极参加军事学校巩固国防”的口号。每一个与会者都郑重地举起了自己的手，宣誓为保卫祖国、反对美帝国主义侵略而贡献自己的一切。最后，南京市学生联合会主席郭加强号召全市学生努力支援人民志愿军的正义斗争；参加国防建设，努力学习军事技术；提高警惕，防止匪特破坏学校；积极展开护校运动。
