    Tianjin Circles Support Chinese and Korean People's Fighters
    Industry and Commerce Officially Present First Batch of Comfort Packages
    [Report from this newspaper] The people of Tianjin are actively donating comfort items to express their regards to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea against the US, and the Korean People's Army.

    As of the 3rd, the Tianjin branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression had received over 2,000 comfort letters entrusted to them, over 2,200 comfort bags and various comfort items, and over 64 million yuan in comfort donations.

    All 回(Hui) employees of the private 牛羊(beef and mutton) slaughterhouse in the Eighth District worked overnight to produce 180 comfort bags. At the same time, employees in each group are actively writing comfort letters.

    All employees of the private Sichuan Animal Products Company used canned beef, socks, gloves, and other items to pack 40 comfort bags to comfort the Korean People's Army. All employees of the China Pig Bristle Company donated 40 comfort bags, and employees of the Junliangcheng Grain Mill of the Grain Company donated 100 comfort bags. Employees of the 百货(department) company wrote over 200 comfort letters in three days and donated towels, canned goods, and 224 comfort bags.

    All the loading and unloading workers at Tianjin North Railway Station voluntarily used 2 million yuan of loading and unloading fees to buy towels for the Volunteer Army, and printed the four red characters "抗美援朝(Resist America, Aid Korea)" on them. Yang Junquan, a female worker at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, wrote earnestly in her comfort letter: Comrades! In order to smash the aggression of the American bandits and build our beautiful future, you are not afraid to shed blood on the anti-aggression battlefield, and we should not be afraid to sweat in factory production. In order to increase production, we will dedicate all our strength.

    Li Zhangmin and Jian Luwen, students of the Central Conservatory of Music, used their engagement gifts as presents. After the Student Union of Nankai University launched a campaign to write comfort letters and sew comfort bags, the 20 female students in Dormitory 318 of the female student dormitory, in addition to first guaranteeing to make comfort bags, also reported to all students through the news agency's broadcasting group that they were willing to voluntarily make comfort bags for male students; the 25 female students in Dormitory 317 were not to be outdone, and immediately responded and were willing to sew comfort bags in large quantities for male students.

    Liu Jianxin, a student at Hebei Provincial Normal School, wrote in his comfort letter: Your courageous actions are a concentrated expression of the anti-imperialist anger of the Chinese people. We will definitely learn from you, vow to be your backing, and wait for the news of your continued victories. Many elementary school students saved their candy money and snack money to buy comfort items. Wu Jiezhi, an eleven-year-old elementary school student, also put his own cartoon depicting the joint killing of the enemy by the people of China and Korea in his comfort letter. Some students at Nankai University attached their own photos to the envelopes to express their sincere greetings.

    Following the 抗美援朝卫国保家(Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Country and Protect Our Homes) demonstration parade, Tianjin's industry and commerce enthusiastically launched a campaign to donate comfort items and write comfort letters. The first batch of items, including a large number of towels donated by more than 60 industries in the city, including import and export, traditional Chinese medicine, and machinery, were delivered to the Tianjin branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression on the afternoon of the 2nd, and a presentation ceremony was held on the spot. Bi Mingqi and Zhu Jisheng, deputy chairmen of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wang Guangying, secretary-general, and heads of various industries participated in this ceremony. The Beijing Film Studio also filmed a newsreel on the spot. The comfort items and comfort letters were filled with sincere concern and respect for the heroic people of Korea and our Volunteer Army, and at the same time expressed the determination of Tianjin's industry and commerce to support the front lines and their deep hatred for American imperialism.

    The Tianjin Women's Federation has also been collecting large quantities of comfort items voluntarily donated by women from all walks of life for days. Housewives have personally sewn more than 200 comfort bags and 20 to 30 pairs of cotton gloves, and written more than 100 comfort letters. Wang Gongshu, an elderly lady aged 51 from the Eighth District, personally made two comfort bags, knitted two pairs of woolen socks, and wrote two comfort letters. Female teachers from the Primary School affiliated to the Teachers' College sent more than 60 comfort bags they had made to the Women's Federation on the 29th of last month. Female medical staff from the Dazhong and Fuying Hospitals delivered 100 comfort bags to the Women's Federation on the 28th of last month. Su Nailiang, a female doctor from the First District, personally sent 100,000 yuan to express her concern for the frontline fighters. The Production Department of the Women's Federation is also rushing to make comfort bags and write comfort letters.

    Since last month, the city's film industry has launched an "Resist America, Aid Korea" film promotion month. The 24 cinemas are divided into three groups and show early screenings every day, and donate all the income to our Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
