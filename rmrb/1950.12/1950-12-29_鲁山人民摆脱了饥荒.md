The People of Lushan Have Escaped Famine
Propaganda Department of the Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

General Situation and Characteristics of the County

Lushan County, Henan Province, is located at the eastern foot of the Funiu Mountains. The county has a total cultivated land area of 744,228 mu and a population of 393,692, averaging only 1.9 mu of land per person. Before liberation, landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for 8% of the county's population, owned 70% of the cultivated land. Under the Kuomintang reactionaries' sinful rule, the people were thoroughly plundered, and coupled with floods and droughts, the level of agricultural production was low and the lives of the masses were extremely poor.

The county's main agricultural products are wheat, followed by corn and beans. About 70% of the population relies on agriculture to maintain their lives, while 30% relies on sideline occupations such as tussah silk, porcelain, paper making, iron sand panning, weaving, collecting mountain products, charcoal burning, coke burning, firewood cutting, and transportation as their main source of livelihood.

After liberation in the autumn of 1947, land reform was carried out in about two-thirds of the county, and poor peasants mostly obtained some land. After rent reduction, anti-banditry, and anti-local-tyrant movements, by the winter before last year's land reform, the landlord and rich peasant economy had been weakened by 70% to 80%. In the other one-third of the area, the landlord and rich peasant economy was also weakened by 30% to 40%.

Production Leadership and Support in the Past Year

The county suffered severe flooding last year. It was estimated that the county's masses would be short of food for an average of three months this spring, which seriously threatened the development of this year's large-scale production campaign. At that time, the leadership attached importance to and focused on the work of overcoming the famine through production. It successively convened county representatives' conferences and district peasant representatives' conferences to conduct in-depth and meticulous research on the disaster situation, and formulated specific methods for overcoming the famine through production. Production-to-overcome-famine committees, headed by key cadres, were established at all levels. At that time, all localities, based on different production avenues and closely integrated with the land reform movement, carried out sideline production throughout the county, and as a result, successfully overcame the spring famine and smoothly transitioned into the large-scale production campaign.

In the early stage of the production movement, due to the lack of experience of leading cadres and general cadres in leading the production of the masses in the new district, although the "Ten Policies for Spring Ploughing Production" were initially implemented at the county representatives' conference and district peasant representatives' conference held in April, the cadres' "take a break" mentality was criticized, and a production target of increasing production by 10% on the original basis was put forward, the formulated production plans and requirements were mostly divorced from reality. After continuous setbacks and continuous exploration, the leadership style was effectively transformed. From within the Party to outside the Party, production policies were vigorously implemented through representatives' conferences at all levels to stabilize the production mood of all strata, establish the masses' idea of improving their lives through labor, and educate Party members, Youth League members, and cadres to take the lead in production. Leading cadres personally went down to strengthen investigation and research, focusing on creating experience and promoting it in a timely manner. The county also carried out the following major specific tasks based on the actual difficulties and demands of the majority of peasants regarding production:

(1) Solving the difficulties of lacking livestock, farm tools, and seeds. The solution was to promote the masses to make extensive use of existing mutual aid forms and mutual aid habits to carry out production mutual aid, declare freedom of lending, and advocate mutual assistance and mutual lending. On the other hand, a large number of agricultural loans were issued with emphasis. Throughout the year, in addition to lending 786,667 jin of wheat seeds, which solved the masses' difficulties in weeding wheat, 448,800 jin of livestock and farm tool loan grain (including grain raised locally) were issued three times, and loans of 115,254,000 yuan were issued. Together with the purchases made by the masses themselves, the county increased its livestock by nearly 5,000 head, added 3,596 ox carts and hand carts, and added a large number of plows, harrows, hoes, and adzes. At the same time, veterinarians were organized, and the old treatment methods of the masses were absorbed to prevent and treat livestock diseases in a timely manner, which was very effective.

(2) Water conservancy construction. The county has suffered greatly from floods and droughts over the years. Based on the urgent demands of the masses in this regard, the people's government vigorously led the masses to dig canals, repair rivers, build dikes, and dig wells, issuing a total of 110,000 jin of water conservancy loan grain and 76,000,300 yuan in loans, implementing work-for-relief. A total of 61 drainage ditches were opened in the county, saving 15,224 mu of land; 164 dikes were built, blocking 24 breaches, which can protect 29,550 mu of land; 8 irrigation ditches were repaired, which can irrigate 2,653 mu of land; 39 wells were repaired and newly dug, and 58 waterwheels were repaired and newly purchased, which can irrigate a total of 1,650 mu of land. The above items can increase grain production by 2,492,690 jin.

(3) Rewarding land reclamation and fertilizer accumulation. A total of 45,077 mu of wasteland were reclaimed in the county, with an average increase of 90 jin of grain per mu, which can increase production by 4,056,930 jin. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, methods such as holding mass forums were used to study and promote the important role of fertilization in production and various methods of fertilizer accumulation, which set off a mass fertilizer accumulation movement. This year, the county applied an average of 4,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of land, exceeding any previous year.

(4) Studying and promoting agricultural production technology. Each district and township in the county universally convened old farmers' forums according to different seasons to study intensive cultivation methods, study seed selection, seed soaking, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests; and then publicized and promoted the research results to the masses. In many areas, the atmosphere of farmers studying production technology is quite strong. This year, the county has effectively achieved deep plowing and fine harrowing, and diligent hoeing and repairing. In the wheat and autumn seasons, the masses have also mostly carried out seed selection.

The County's Agricultural Production Has Exceeded the Pre-War Level

In the three years since the liberation of Lushan, especially after the completion of land reform throughout the county this year, the county's production landscape has been completely changed. Agricultural production, except for the ninth district, where the work base is not good enough and is close to the pre-war level, has mostly exceeded the pre-war level in other areas. According to the survey statistics in two different types of districts and eight different types of townships in six districts, the average yield per mu of land before the war was 255 jin, the average yield per mu before liberation was 248 jin, and the average yield per mu this year was 300 jin. In terms of livestock and farm tools, in 1936, there were 20,876 head of livestock and 41,899 plows, harrows, adzes, and hoes. In 1946, there were 18,933 head of livestock and 41,564 plows, harrows, hoes, and adzes. This year, there are 21,598 head of livestock and 47,105 plows, harrows, hoes, and adzes. This year, the county produced a total of 223,267,400 jin of grain (excluding the increased production from water conservancy and land reclamation and sideline production), overfulfilling this year's production plan to increase production by 10%. In addition to paying public grain, each person has an average of 515 jin of grain, which can maintain the general living standard for the whole year.

At the county labor model conference held on December 5, the labor models universally acknowledged the fact that 60% to 70% of the households had enough grain produced throughout the year to eat, 30% to 40% of the households had surplus grain, and a very small number of households that did not have enough to eat could also solve the problem from sideline production. That is to say, the people of Lushan have since escaped the historical famine. This is a gratifying and great change in the history of the people of Lushan. Therefore, at the labor model conference, all labor models reported their production achievements with great joy, exchanged production experiences, and established the banner of future production labor. Everyone was full of confidence and wanted to achieve food and clothing in next year's large-scale production movement and further strengthen the country's economic construction and national defense construction.

    鲁山人民摆脱了饥荒
    中共鲁山县委宣传部
    全县的概况与特点
    河南省鲁山县地处伏牛山东麓，全县耕地面积七十四万四千二百二十八亩，人口三十九万三千六百九十二名，每人仅平均一亩九分土地。该地解放前，占全县人口百分之八的地主和富农，占有耕地面积百分之七十；在国民党反动派罪恶统治下，被搜刮殆尽，又加水旱灾荒，以致农业生产水平低下，群众生活极为贫困。
    全县农产品主要是小麦，其次是玉蜀黍和豆类。群众约百分之七十依靠农业维持生活；百分之三十依靠柞蚕、瓷器、捞纸、捞铁沙、编织、采山货、烧木炭、焦炭、砍柴、运输等副业为主要生活来源。
    一九四七年秋解放后，全县约三分之二的地区曾一度进行土改，贫苦农民大都得到一部分土地；后经减租、反匪、反恶霸等运动，到去年冬天土地改革前为止，地主、富农经济已被削弱百分之七十至八十。另三分之一的地区，地主、富农经济也被削弱百分之三十至四十。
    一年来的生产领导与扶持
    该县去年水灾严重，据估计，全县群众今春平均要缺三个月的食粮，严重威胁着今年大生产运动的开展。当时领导方面重视并抓紧了生产度荒工作，曾连续召开了县各界代表会和区农代会，深入细致地研究了灾情，订出了具体的生产度荒办法；并逐级成立了以主要干部负责的生产度荒委员会。当时各地都根据不同的生产门路，密切结合土地改革运动，在全县范围内开展了副业生产，结果胜利度过春荒，并顺利转入了大生产运动。
    生产运动初期，由于领导干部及一般干部领导新区群众生产缺乏经验，因此虽然在四月召开的县各界代表会和区农代会上，初步贯彻了春耕生产十大政策，批判了干部“歇一歇”的思想，并提出了在原有基础上增产一成的生产任务。但所制订的生产计划与要求，却多脱离实际。经过不断碰壁、不断摸索后，便切实转变领导作风，从党内到党外，通过各级代表会大力贯彻生产政策，稳定各阶层的生产情绪，树立群众从劳动中改善生活的思想，教育党员、团员、干部在生产中带头；领导干部则亲自下去，从加强调查研究入手，有重点地创造经验并及时推广。全县并根据广大农民对生产的实际困难与要求，做了以下几项主要的具体工作：
    （一）解决牲畜、农具、种籽的缺乏困难。解决办法是，一方面推动群众大量运用旧有的互助形式与互助习惯，进行生产互助，并宣布借贷自由，提倡互助互借：另方面则有重点地发放大批农贷。全年除贷放麦种七十八万六千六百六十七斤，解决了群众耘麦困难外，并三次发放牲畜、农具贷粮（包括由地方自筹贷粮）四十四万八千八百斤，贷款一亿一千五百二十五万四千元；连同群众自己购买的，全县共计增加牲畜近五千头，增添牛车、手车三千五百九十六辆，增添大批犁、耙、锄，镢，同时并组织兽医，及吸取群众旧有治疗方法，及时防止与治疗牲畜病疫，收效很大。
    （二）兴修水利。该县历年水灾旱灾为害甚大。人民政府根据群众对这方面的迫切要求，大力领导群众开渠，修河，筑堤，打井，共发放水利贷粮十一万斤，贷款七千六百万零三百元，实行以工代赈。计全县共开排水渠六十一道，救出土地一万五千二百二十四亩；筑堤一百六十四道，堵决口二十四处，能保护土地二万九千五百五十亩；修复灌溉渠八道，可灌溉土地二千六百五十三亩；修复与新打水井三十九眼，修理与新购水车五十八架，共可浇地一千六百五十亩。以上各项共可增产粮食二百四十九万二千六百九十斤。
    （三）奖励开荒积肥。计全县共开荒四万五千零七十七亩，平均每亩增产粮食九十斤。共可增产四百零五万六千九百三十斤。积肥方面，曾运用召开群众座谈会等方式，研究与推广施肥对生产的重要作用和各种积肥方法，掀起了群众性的积肥运动。今年全县每亩土地平均施肥四千斤，超过了已往任何一年。
    （四）研究与推广农业生产技术。全县各区、乡普遍根据不同季节，召开老农座谈会，研究精耕细作方法，研究选种、浸种及防治病虫害等；再将研究结果向群众宣传推广。很多地区农民研究生产技术的空气颇盛。今年全县切实做到了深犁细耙，勤锄多修。麦秋两季，群众也大都进行了选种。
    全县农业生产已超过了战前水平
    鲁山解放三年来，特别是经过全县完成土改后的今年一年来的生产建设，全县生产面貌已完全改观了。农业生产，除工作基础不够好的第九区接近战前水平外，其余地区大都超过了战前水平。根据在两个不同类型区，和六个区的八个不同类型乡的调查统计，战前每亩土地平均产量为二百五十五斤，解放前每亩平均产量为二百四十八斤，今年每亩平均产量则为三百斤；牲畜、农具方面，一九三六年，牲畜为二万零八百七十六头，犁、耙、镢锄共四万一千八百九十九件。一九四六年牲畜为一万八千九百三十三头，犁、耙、锄、镢共四万一千五百六十四件，今年牲畜则为二万一千五百九十八头，犁、耙、锄、镢共四万七千一百零五件。今年全县共产粮食二亿二千三百二十六万七千四百斤（水利开荒增产和副业生产未计入），超额完成今年增产一成的生产计划。除缴纳公粮外，每人平均有粮食五百十五斤，可以维持全年一般的生活水平。
    在十二月五日召开的全县劳模大会上，劳动模范们普遍承认这样一个事实：即群众全年一年所生产的粮食，有百分之六十至七十的户够吃用，百分之三十至四十的户尚有余粮，很少数不够吃的户，从副业生产中也都能得到解决。这就是说，鲁山人民从此摆脱了历史性的饥荒，这是鲁山人民生活史上的一个可喜的大转变。因此，劳模会上全体劳动模范们都以极大的喜悦报告了生产成绩，交流了生产经验，并树立了今后的生产劳动旗帜，大家信心十足地要在明年大生产运动中达到丰衣足食，更加强国家经济建设与国防建设的力量。
