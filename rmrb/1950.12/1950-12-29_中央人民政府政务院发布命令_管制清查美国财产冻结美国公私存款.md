    Central People's Government Government Administration Council Issues Order
    Control and Investigate American Property, Freeze American Public and Private Deposits
    Order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China

    The United States government announced on December 16, 1950, that it would control public and private property of our People's Republic of China in areas under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit all ships registered in the U.S. from sailing to Chinese ports, attempting to further plunder the property of the Chinese people economically, following its armed aggression against our Taiwan, bombing of our Northeast, and shelling of our merchant ships.

    In view of the increasingly aggressive and hostile actions of the United States government against our country, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in order to prevent it from engaging in economic sabotage and endangering the interests of our country and people within our borders, hereby adopts the following measures:

    1. All properties of the U.S. government and American enterprises within the People's Republic of China shall be immediately placed under the control of the local People's Governments and investigated; no transfer or disposal shall be made without the approval of the People's Government (Military and Administrative Committee) of the Greater Administrative Region (Central government-affiliated provinces and cities shall report to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for approval). The owners or managers of these properties shall be responsible for protecting them and shall not damage them.

    2. All public and private American deposits in all banks within the People's Republic of China shall be frozen immediately. Expenses necessary for maintaining legitimate business and personal living may be used only after being approved by the local People's Government. The amount of such usage shall be separately stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council.

    The above order shall take effect immediately upon promulgation.

    Premier Zhou Enlai
    December 28, 1950

    二、中华人民共和国境内所有银行的一切美国公私存款，应即行冻结。为维持正当业务及个人生活必需的费用，亦须经当地人民政府核准后始得动用。其动用数额。由政务院财政经济委员会另行规定。
