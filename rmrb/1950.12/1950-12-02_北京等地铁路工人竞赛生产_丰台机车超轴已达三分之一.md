    Railway Workers in Beijing and Other Places Compete in Production
    Fengtai Locomotives Exceed Axle Load by One-Third

    [Our Newspaper] Railway workers in Beijing, Baoding, Fengtai, and other places, after studying current events related to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, and after denouncing the U.S. imperialists' atrocities and crimes of aggression, have gained a clearer understanding. To defend their motherland and their current good lives, they are now vigorously engaged in patriotic production competitions.

    In the Fengtai area, since November 14th, when the old hero Li Yong proposed a patriotic over-axle movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect the country, one-third of the locomotives have now exceeded their axle load. The highest exceedance has reached over 30%. The "Mao Zedong" locomotive has exceeded its total axle load by more than 3,000 tons. To ensure safer "over-axle" transportation, the engineering section has proposed a "full-line tamping, elimination of slow zones, and bridge reinforcement" campaign, ensuring the completion of full-line tamping on the Beijing-Tianjin line in November. Various departments have also launched campaigns to eliminate accidents in coordination with the completion of winter transportation tasks. The materials factory guarantees no accidents in the escort of 5,000 tons, and the transportation section has also made a guarantee of no accidents for 300 trains. In terms of conservation, workers have launched campaigns to save coal, oil, and manpower. Workers in the locomotive section have put forward slogans for saving coal and oil. To solve the manpower shortage, they have voluntarily proposed changing the three-shift system to a two-shift system, saving a shift's worth of manpower to do work on other trains. Currently, seven locomotives have been approved, saving 27 people and solving the problem of insufficient locomotive manpower. To ensure that other units have no accidents and complete winter transportation tasks, the inspection section has established a "ten-part responsibility system" (each vehicle is divided into ten parts, with division of labor and responsibility). The number of vehicles inspected daily has increased from 60 to 160. The telecommunications section guarantees that the production tasks for the last two months of this year will be completed ahead of schedule in November and has issued challenges to telecommunications workers in various regions across the bureau. Water pump workers in Langfang have stated that they can guarantee water supply under any circumstances.

    Railway workers in Baoding have generally set up group plans. To prevent accidents, they have proposed slogans such as "check smoke pipes, remove water rust, and eliminate hidden special agents." Seven locomotives in the locomotive section have already raised the "50 days without accidents" competition battle flag. At the same time, the transportation section has also made a guarantee of "300,000 kilometers without accidents." To improve the quality of vehicle repairs and save coal, workers have proposed the slogan "turn old cars into new cars, save coal by 14%." Employees of the telecommunications section unanimously stated: "An inch impassable, a hundred miles impassable, we must ensure that the telephone is always working."

    Almost all of the 760 workers at the Beijing District Vehicle Inspection Section have expressed their determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Many workers have stated in their pledges that they will guarantee to stick to their posts, obey leadership, prevent spies and special agents, and keep transportation secrets to complete production tasks. They have made a guarantee of "machines are here, people are here." A patriotic production competition is in full swing throughout the factory. All the workers in the battery inspection group of the car electric charging room originally guaranteed that this year's task would be completed ahead of schedule on November 25th, but as a result of the active efforts of the employees, it was completed on the 15th. They have also guaranteed that they can complete the past highest production record of accumulators in 38 days. After studying current events, the workers in the boiler room were extremely indignant at the atrocities of the U.S. imperialists. They resolved to support Korea with their practical actions, guaranteeing to complete the tasks of 34 people this winter with the existing 24 people, and proposed to replace the current Kailuan lump coal with Kailuan No. 1 fine coal, and guarantee that the coal ash reaches 90%, which can save 20% compared to the past use of coal, and can also guarantee the original standard steam of three kilograms; some workers also expressed their willingness to participate in any emergency repairs. When the telecommunications section installed 363 ampoule batteries in November, it was originally planned to complete the task in one month, but all the employees, in order to respond to the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, gave full play to their initiative and creativity, overcoming various difficulties in tools and materials, and completed the task 20 days ahead of schedule. During the work, many workers forgot to eat and sleep. For example, Tian Deshan, a worker on the night shift, refused to rest during the day; Li Changgeng moved from his home to the factory to sleep in order to complete the work tasks early; Gao Yufang, a welder, could only weld three pieces a day at first, but in the end, she welded as many as nine pieces a day, saving a lot of manpower and materials. Because the workers were enthusiastically involved in this patriotic production competition, it is estimated that the task for 1950 can generally be completed ahead of schedule. The workers said: "We must eliminate U.S. imperialism on the production front!"

    北京等地铁路工人竞赛生产
    丰台机车超轴已达三分之一
    【本报讯】北京、保定、丰台等地的铁路工友，经过抗美援朝保家卫国的时事学习和控诉美帝暴行对美帝的侵略罪行，认识得更清楚了，他们为了保卫自己的祖国及现在的好日子，现在正轰轰烈烈地进行着爱国主义的生产竞赛。
    丰台地区的铁路工人，自十一月十四日，就有李永老英雄提出抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义超轴运动，现在已有三分之一的机车超轴了；超轴数最高额达到百分之三十以上。“毛泽东号”机车，总超轴数已达三千多吨。工务段为了保证“超轴”运输更安全，提出了“全线捣固，消灭徐行，桥梁加固”运动，保证十一月内完成京津全线捣固的任务。各部门又为了配合冬运任务的完成，也展开了消灭事故的运动，材料厂保证五千吨押运无事故，车务段也提出了三百列车无事故的保证。在节约方面，工人展开了节煤、节油与节人的运动，机务段的工友，提出了节煤节油的口号。他们为了解决人力困难，又自动提出将三班制改为两班制，好省出一班的人力来，做别个车上的工作，目前已经有七台机车被批准，省去了二十七人，解决了机车人力不足的问题。检车段为保证其他各单位无事故及完成冬运任务，建立了“十部负责制”（每辆车分成十个部分，分工负责），每日检车数已由六十辆提高到一百六十辆。电务段今年最后两个月的生产任务，保证提前在十一月内完成，并已向全局各地区电务工作者，发出了挑战书；廊房水泵工人表示他们可以在任何情况下保证送水。
    保定铁路工友，普遍的订出小组计划，为了防止事故，他们提出“抽烟管，打水锈，消灭暗藏特务”的口号，机务段已经有七台机车，竖起了“五十天无事故”的竞赛战旗；车务段同时也提出“三十万公里无事故”的保证。为提高修车质量及节煤，工人提出“旧车变新车，节煤到百分之十四”的口号。电务段职工们也一致表示：“一寸不通，百里不通，我们要保证电话常通”。
    北京区检车段全厂七百六十个工友，差不多都表示了自己抗美援朝的决心，许多工友在自己的决心书里，表示保证坚守着自己的岗位，服从领导，防奸防特，保守运输秘密，来完成生产任务。他们提出“机器在，人也在”的保证。厂内全面展开了爱国主义生产竞赛的热潮。车电充电房蓄电池乙检的全体工友，原来保证今年任务提前在十一月二十五日完成，结果在职工们的积极努力下，在十五日就完成了，他们又保证可以再完成过去蓄电池最高生产纪录三十八天的任务。锅炉房的工友们，在时事学习后，对于美帝暴行，异常愤慨，他们决以自己的实际行动，支援朝鲜，保证以现有二十四人来完成今冬三十四人的任务，并提出把现用的开滦元煤改用开滦头号末煤，且保证煤灰到百分之九十，较过去用煤可节省百分之二十，而且还能保证送原来三公斤的标准汽；有的工友并表示愿意参加任何时候的抢修工作。电务段在十一月里按装三六三安瓿蓄电池时，原计划一个月完成任务，但全体职工为了响应抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，都发挥了积极性与创造性，克服了工具与材料上的种种困难，提前二十天就完成了任务，在工作当中，不少工友是废寝忘餐，如值夜班的工友田德山，白天还不肯去休息；李长庚为了赶早完成工作任务，从家里搬到厂里睡；高玉芳做焊工，每天只能焊三个，末了每天竟焊到九个之多，节省了不少人力与材料，由于工人们都热烈投进这个爱国主义生产竞赛中，估计一九五○年的任务，普遍的可以提前完成。工人们说：“咱们要在生产战线上消灭美帝国主义！”
