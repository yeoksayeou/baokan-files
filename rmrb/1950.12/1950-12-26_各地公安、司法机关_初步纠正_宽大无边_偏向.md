    Public Security and Judicial Organs in Various Regions
    Initially Correct the Deviation of "Boundless Leniency"
    [This newspaper reports] Recently, public security and judicial leading organs at all levels have systematically reviewed the distortion of the "leniency policy" or the so-called "boundless leniency" deviation in the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities in various regions and formulated plans to thoroughly correct this deviation. These plans are being implemented by public security and judicial organs at all levels.
    Judging from the review reports from various regions, "boundless leniency" was a fairly common deviation. It mainly manifested in insufficient and untimely suppression of counter-revolutionaries with heinous crimes. The most obvious examples are: In the Northeast, the Kuomintang secret agent Nan Shoushan, the leader of the secret service who was captured for plotting the assassination of General Li Zhaolin, Guo Yongtong and Liu Rende, the traitors who murdered our cadres, and Li Rentian, the special agent who harmed sixteen of our staff members, were all sentenced to only short-term imprisonment. In Hebei, a habitual bandit from Xianghe who killed nine people was released carelessly. In Gansu Province, the cases submitted for approval regarding the execution of bandit leaders Hao Jujia and Feng Liangchen in the Wuwei area were delayed for eight months without approval. In Shandong Province, there were cases submitted for approval that had been delayed for more than two years.
    The prison management system was also not strict enough, resulting in frequent incidents of prisoners escaping. In Hebei, Chahar, and Pingyuan provinces, a total of more than 1,120 prisoners escaped this year, nearly 20 percent of whom were counter-revolutionaries. Similar incidents have also occurred in Shanghai, Gansu, Shandong, and other places. In the implementation of prison policies, many places failed to correctly implement the policy of "combining punishment and control with education and transformation," and adopted the wrong approach of "relying on prisoners to manage prisoners." This is equivalent to handing over the power of punishment and control to the punished and controlled elements, which obviously forgets the meaning of "dictatorship" in the people's democratic dictatorship system and will certainly cause losses.
    The existence of the deviation of boundless leniency has boosted the arrogance of counter-revolutionaries. Some bandits and special agents, after being released in one place, commit evil in another; released today, they continue to endanger the people tomorrow. In the Southwest, there were bandit leaders who were captured and released four times, and in the Northeast, there were special agents who were caught and released three times, and they continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities without any remorse. Some bandits and special agents in the Southwest said: "Being caught means at most three months in prison, let's do it!" A bandit in Fujian openly threatened our lower-level cadres, saying: "If you report me to the government and have me arrested, I will be released in three days anyway, and then you will be in trouble." As a result, in areas with serious banditry, the enthusiasm of the masses and lower-level cadres to fight bandits and special agents has been greatly suppressed. In individual places, there have even been counter-revolutionary double-dealing village regimes that collected grain and weapons for bandits. Therefore, the masses are greatly dissatisfied with such boundless leniency, and they have responded one after another: "The bad guys are getting better, and the good guys are getting worse." "The government is lawless." "The government's leniency has no limits." "Offending the government doesn't matter, but offending the bandits will lead to murder." On the other hand, because of insufficient suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the hatred of lower-level cadres and the masses could not be appeased, and in individual places, there was a phenomenon of killing people without following legal procedures. For example, in Xianghe, Hebei, a pseudo-soldier who had committed many evils was killed by village cadres after being released and returning home. They said: "In the past, he killed our people and was treated with leniency, so we will certainly be treated with leniency if we kill him." This situation has also occurred in Nan'an County in Fujian and Guiping County in Guangxi.
    According to the review reports from various regions, the reason why the deviation of boundless leniency occurred is that after the open enemies were eliminated, some cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of the situation of the hidden struggle, and they developed a sense of peace and complacency, thinking, "The enemy's millions of troops have been wiped out by us, what's so great about a few special agents and bandits?!" Some cadres in Pingyuan Province said: "In the old liberated areas, in a peaceful environment, the enemy and puppet elements are not terrible; the land reform is over, and the landlord's revenge will not be a problem, there is no need to be alarmed."
    Some cadres have vague policy concepts, do not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and misunderstand the policy of combining suppression and leniency as one-sided leniency. A bandit leader in Dianjiang, eastern Sichuan, killed more than 50 of our people in two riots, and the county party committee even said at a mass meeting: "We will still be lenient to those who killed our people." Some cadres said: "We must have the courage to transform bad people." Some believe that: "Confession is meritorious service and can be released." In some places in the Southwest, even gave the surrendered bandit leaders center level meal rations.
    The existence of strong old legal viewpoints in judicial organs has also prevented many important counter-revolutionaries from being duly punished. Shandong even considered a key special agent who had committed heinous crimes to not be a resolute counter-revolutionary because the criminal had fled before the liberation of a certain city, "which proves that he is not a resolute anti-us element." Some cadres only focused on some legal terms, such as "first-time offender," "attempted crime," "not the mastermind," etc., and did not severely punish the key counter-revolutionary leaders who had committed heinous crimes.
    In addition, some public security cadres do not have a clear understanding of the complete process of suppression of counter-revolutionary activities, including investigation, case solving, interrogation, and handling. They believe that investigation and case solving are the responsibility of the public security organs, and interrogation and handling are the responsibility of the judicial departments. They lack a serious spirit of being responsible to the end, which has led to many cases having a beginning but no end. This is also one of the reasons for the formation of the deviation of boundless leniency.
    The above-mentioned erroneous thoughts and practices have attracted the close attention of public security and judicial leading organs in various regions since the State Council of the Central People's Government and the Supreme People's Court jointly issued instructions on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities in July this year; especially after the rectification movement, these erroneous thoughts have been severely criticized; recently, various regions have conducted systematic reviews, which have led to the initial correction of the deviation of boundless leniency, but efforts should be continued to thoroughly correct it in order to more effectively combat the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries.

### 各地公安、司法机关  初步纠正“宽大无边”偏向

    各地公安、司法机关
    初步纠正“宽大无边”偏向
    【本报讯】各级公安、司法领导机关，最近对于各地镇压反革命活动中的曲解“宽大政策”或所谓“宽大无边”偏向，作了系统检讨，并拟订了彻底纠正这一偏向的计划。这些计划正在各级公安、司法机关贯彻实施。
    从各地的检讨报告来看，“宽大无边”曾是相当普遍的偏向。它主要表现在对罪大恶极的反革命分子镇压不够严厉，而且很不及时。最显明的例证是：东北对捕获的密谋暗杀李兆麟将军的蒋匪保密局组长南守善，谋杀我方干部的内奸国特郭永通、刘仁德，害我十六名工作人员的李仁田等罪大恶极的特务分子，均只判以短期徒刑。河北竟将杀害九条人命的香河惯匪，轻率释放。甘肃省对武威专区处决匪首郝钜家、冯良臣的呈批案件，积压八个月之久尚未批示。山东省则有积压两年多的呈批案件。
    监狱管理制度也不够严密，致犯人越狱逃跑事件屡次发生。河北、察哈尔、平原三省，今年以来共逃跑犯人一千一百二十多人，其中反革命分子近百分之二十。上海、甘肃、山东等地亦曾发生类似事件。在监狱政策的执行上，许多地方未能正确贯彻“惩罚管制与教育改造相结合”的政策，而采取了“依靠犯人管理犯人”的错误方针，这等于把惩罚管制的权力交到被惩罚管制分子的手里，这显然忘记了人民民主专政制度中“专政”的意义，当然会造成损失。
    宽大无边偏向的存在，助长了反革命分子的气焰。有些土匪、特务分子，在此地被释放，又在彼地作恶；今日释放，明日又继续危害人民。西南有四捉四放的匪首，东北有三擒三纵的特务，而他们依然继续进行反革命活动，毫无悔过之心。西南有些土匪、特务说：“捉住顶多关三个月，干吧！”福建一个土匪公然威胁我们的下层干部，他说：“你要到政府去报告我，把我抓走，反正三天会放我出来，那时你就不得了。”这一来，在匪患严重的地区，群众及下层干部的反匪反特热情，大受压抑。在个别地方，竟然出现了反革命的两面派的村政权，为匪征收粮款，收集武器。因此，群众对这样无边的宽大，大为不满，纷纷反应说：“好了坏人，坏了好人。”“政府有天无法。”“政府宽大得没了门框。”“得罪了政府没关系，得罪了土匪要杀人。”另一方面，因为对反革命分子镇压不够，使下层干部与群众的仇恨不得平息，个别地方又产生了不按法律手续杀人的现象。例如河北香河一作恶多端的伪军被释放回家后，即被村干部打死。他们说：“过去他杀了我们的人得到宽大，我们杀了他也一定能够得到宽大。”这种情形在福建南安县、广西桂平县等地也曾发生过。
    根据各地的检讨报告，宽大无边的偏向之所以发生，乃是因为在公开的敌人被消灭以后，一部分干部对隐蔽斗争的形势认识不够，滋长了太平麻痹的观念，认为“敌人的几百万大军都被我们消灭了，剩下几个特务土匪有啥了不起？！”平原省有些干部说：“老区，和平环境，敌伪分子并不可怕；土改结束了，地主的倒算也不会成什么问题，不必大惊小怪。”
    有些干部政策观念模糊，敌我不分，把镇压与宽大相结合的政策，误解为片面的宽大。川东垫江一个匪首在两次暴乱中杀我五十余人，县委还在群众大会上说：“杀了我们的人，我们还是要宽大。”有的干部说：“要有魄力改造坏人。”有的认为：“坦白就是立功，就可以释放。”西南有的地方，竟给投降的匪首吃中灶饭。
    司法机关存在着浓厚的旧的法律观点，也使许多重要的反革命分子未能受到应有的制裁。山东对一罪大恶极的首要特务，竟认为不是坚决的反革命分子，因为在解放某城前，该犯即已逃跑，“足证不是坚决抗我的分子”。有些干部则只在一些法律名词，例如“初犯”，“未遂犯”，“不是主谋”等等名词上打圈子，而不对罪大恶极的反革命首要加以严惩。
    此外，某些公安干部对侦察、破案、审讯、处理一系列的完整的镇压反革命活动的过程，认识不够清楚，以为侦察、破案是公安机关的事情，审讯、处理是司法部门的任务，缺乏严肃的负责到底的精神，致使不少案件有头无尾，这也是形成宽大无边偏向的原因之一。
    上述这些错误的思想与作法，自今年七月中央人民政府政务院与最高人民法院联合发布镇压反革命活动的指示后，即已引起各地公安、司法领导机关的密切注意；特别经过整风运动之后，这些错误思想已经受到严格批判；最近，各地又作了系统检讨，已使宽大无边的偏向得到初步纠正，但应继续努力作彻底纠正，以便更有效地打击反革命的破坏活动。
