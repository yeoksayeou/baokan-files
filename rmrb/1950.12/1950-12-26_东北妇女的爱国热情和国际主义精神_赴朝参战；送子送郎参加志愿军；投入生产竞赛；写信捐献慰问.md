Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th – Women in Northeast China have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country.

Many women have volunteered to go to the front lines of the anti-aggression war. In An Dong City, which has been repeatedly bombed and strafed by American planes, more than two hundred women have volunteered to go to Korea to work in rescue operations. Meng Qingyun and three other female truck drivers from Dalian Fisheries Company have also signed up to volunteer for transportation work on the front lines. Female students from cities such as Changchun, Harbin, and Dalian have organized battlefield service teams, rescue teams, and blood transfusion teams, volunteering to serve on the Korean front lines. The first group of fifty people from the rescue team organized by Harbin Nursing School departed a few days ago. In Beixing District, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, seven women have also volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the war.

Women in various places are sending their husbands and children to Korea to join the Volunteer Army. Old Mrs. Song from Huanren County, Liaodong Province, had given birth to eleven children, but under the starvation and cold of the Japanese occupation period, the children died one by one, leaving only one son. This time, after hearing that American imperialism was invading Korea and our border, she immediately encouraged her only son, Song Maolin, to sign up for the Volunteer Army. In Dalian City, Old Mrs. Wang, a mother of five children, had already sent three sons to join the People's Liberation Army during the Liberation War, and recently sent her two daughters to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. After Li Jingshan, a young man from the suburbs of the city who had only been married for fourteen days, signed up to join the Volunteer Army, his wife encouraged him, saying, "Let's reunite after defeating the American devils." Ma Shuqin, a woman from Paozi Village, Jinxi County, Liaoxi Province, and a woman surnamed Gao from Huandongzi Village, Tai'an County, both persuaded their fiancés to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Female workers in various places have plunged into the upsurge of patriotic production competitions. Since Zhu Lihua and twenty-two other female workers from the Shenyang Nail Factory No. 3 organized a "production shock team" in October to promote a production competition throughout the factory, the factory completed its October production task in sixteen days. Although the production task was increased in November, the task was still completed five days ahead of schedule. In the two-month production competition in various factories in Dalian, female workers have achieved excellent results. The female worker Zhang Yulan's team at the city's brick factory repairs 53.5% more high-voltage insulators per day than in the past; the output of the female core-making team at the Metal Machinery Factory has also increased by more than 50%. Sixty-seven female workers at the hemp sack factory in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, spun 50% more hemp yarn in November than in October, enabling the factory to overfulfill its hemp sack weaving task. Female employees of the Changchun Telephone Bureau also organized a "defect elimination shock team." The number of errors at the bureau has decreased by 64% compared to October.

Women in vast rural areas and cities are also actively sewing shoes and clothing for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and donating other comfort items. Recently, 3,000 women in Xilin District, Panshi County, Jilin Province, sewed military shoes for the Volunteer Army. Women in Harbin City have donated over 58 million Northeast currency in comfort funds and written 621 comfort letters. Women in Huangqibao District, Yongji County, Jilin Province, made and donated 280 pairs of shoes and 135 pairs of gloves embroidered with words such as "Defend the Country, bravely kill the enemy." Yu Guixian, a woman from Yujia Village, Jin County, Jilin Province, embroidered large red flowers on bleached handkerchiefs and sent them to the Volunteer Army. Rural women also generally donate fruits, dried vegetables, eggs, and other items to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers.

    东北妇女的爱国热情和国际主义精神
    赴朝参战；送子送郎参加志愿军；投入生产竞赛；写信捐献慰问
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】东北广大妇女在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中表现了高度的爱国热情和国际主义精神。
    许多妇女志愿参加到反侵略战争的最前线去。屡次遭受美国飞机轰炸及扫射的安东市已有二百多个妇女志愿赴朝鲜作救护工作。大连渔业公司孟庆云等四个女汽车司机也已报名志愿去前线担任运输工作。长春、哈尔滨、大连等市的女学生都纷纷组织战地服务队、救护队及输血队等，志愿到朝鲜前线服务。其中哈尔滨护士学校组织的救护队，第一批五十人已于日前出发。黑龙江省克山县北兴区也有七个妇女志愿赴朝鲜参战。
    各地妇女纷纷送她们的丈夫和子女赴朝鲜参加志愿军。辽东省桓仁县的宋老太太曾经生过十一个孩子，在日寇统治时期饥寒交迫的生活下孩子们一个个地死去，最后只剩下了一个儿子。这次她听到美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和我国边境后，马上鼓励她的唯一的儿子宋茂林报名参加志愿军。大连市一位五个孩子的母亲王老太太，在解放战争中已把三个儿子送去参加人民解放军，最近又送她的两个女儿去参加人民志愿军。该市郊区结婚才十四天的青年李景山报名参加志愿军后，他的妻子勉励他说：“打败了美国鬼子再团圆。”辽西省锦西县泡子村妇女马淑琴和台安县桓洞子村一个高姓妇女都劝说她们的未婚夫参加了中国人民志愿军。
    各地女工都已纷纷投入爱国主义生产竞赛的热潮。沈阳制钉三厂朱丽华等二十三个女工自十月份组织了“生产突击队”推动全厂展开生产竞赛以来，该厂十月份生产任务已在十六天内完成，十一月份虽然增加了生产任务，但还是提前五天完成任务。大连各工厂在两个多月的生产竞赛中，女工们已创造了优良的成绩。该市砖碍工厂女工张玉兰小组每天较过去多修理百分之五十三点五的高压碍子；金属机械工厂女工打芯子组的产量也比以前增加了百分之五十以上。黑龙江省讷河县职工麻袋工厂六十七个女工十一月份较十月份多纺了百分之五十的麻线，使该厂织麻袋任务超额完成。长春市报话局女职工也组织了“消灭差错突击队”。现该局差错已较十月份减少了百分之六十四。
    广大农村及城市妇女并纷纷自动地给中国人民志愿军缝制鞋子和服装，并赠送其他慰问物品。吉林省盘石县细林区最近有三千个妇女给志愿军赶缝军鞋。哈尔滨市妇女已捐赠慰问金东北币五千八百余万元，并写了六百二十一封慰问信。吉林省永吉县黄旗堡区妇女制赠了二百八十双鞋子和一百三十五付绣着“保家卫国、勇敢杀敌”等字样的手套。吉林省金县于家村妇女于桂贤在漂白的手巾上绣上大红花，送给志愿军。农村妇女并普遍赠送水果、菜干、鸡蛋等物品慰问中国人民志愿军战士。
