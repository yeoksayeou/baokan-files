Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 6th (TASS): According to a report from the Telepress correspondent in London, prominent right-wing Labour MP Edeyrn Bevan told his constituents last weekend that MacArthur is exactly "what you'd call a bull in a china shop." Bevan said: "He has appointed himself to the role of a new political savior who wants to eradicate communism in the world by force. But it won't work... Communism cannot be destroyed." Bevan said: "The people of Asia will not fight to defend corrupt regimes like those of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek."

    英一右翼工党议员向选区听众说
    麦克阿瑟是闯进瓷器店的牛
    【新华社讯】塔斯社布拉格六日电：据电通社驻伦敦记者报道，著名的右翼工党议员伊文思上周末告诉他的选区的听众说：麦克阿瑟正是“俗语所谓闯进了瓷器店里的牛。”伊文思说：“他已自己派定了要以武力铲除世界上共产主义的新的政治救世主的角色。但是，这是行不通的……共产主义是毁灭不掉的。”伊文思说：“亚洲人民不会为维护像李承晚与蒋介石那样败坏腐化的政权而战斗”。
