    [Reported by this newspaper] A group of young people from the Jiangfang (River Defense) Forces of the Guangdong Military Region, including Yuan Zhenyi and 616 others, wrote a letter of determination on the occasion of "World Youth Day," stating that if the U.S. imperialists dare to provoke war at sea, they will resolutely eliminate them in the sea. The letter of determination stated: "A hundred years of blood-stained history has made us deeply realize that the U.S. imperialists are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people."
    After denouncing the crimes of the invading U.S. troops in Korea in violating our country's territorial land, sea, and air, and expressing great respect for the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and our volunteer troops, they stated: "We guarantee to support the just war of the Korean people against aggression with enhanced combat will and high vigilance, and with practical actions! We, a group of young people from the Chinese People's Navy, are, like all comrades in the South China Sea Fleet, lovers of peace. Today, as we commemorate the "World Youth Day" for young people, we will express our determination to fight for peace under the general goal of "uniting and advancing towards lasting peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future." If the U.S. imperialists dare to provoke a war of aggression at sea, we will resolutely eliminate them in the sea."
