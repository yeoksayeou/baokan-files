    Beijing Industrial and Commercial Tax Reporting and Payment Methods
        Specific Regulations Issued by the Beijing Taxation Bureau
    The Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau recently issued a notice stipulating the reporting and payment methods for industrial and commercial income tax for the year 1950. All industrial and commercial households in the city that use the "declaration and accounting" and "democratic appraisal" methods for calculating industrial and commercial tax will use the declaration and accounting method to report and pay income tax for the year 1950. They should complete the settlement of their full-year business accounts for 1950 before January 20, 1951, and declare to the tax sub-bureau in charge based on their respective final accounting statements. The tax sub-bureau will first verify the full-year income tax amount based on the filled-out declaration forms, deduct the portion already estimated and collected in the first half of the year, and set a time limit for remittance to the treasury. As for those who calculate industrial and commercial tax using the "fixed period and fixed amount" method, their income tax will no longer be reconciled and paid.
