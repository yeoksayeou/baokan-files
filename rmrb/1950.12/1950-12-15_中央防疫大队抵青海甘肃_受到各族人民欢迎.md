    Xinhua News Agency Report: The Seventh Detachment of the Central Anti-Epidemic Corps arrived in Xining City, Qinghai, and the Labrang Tibetan area of Gansu in late last month, and was warmly welcomed by the local people of all ethnic groups. When a part of the detachment went to Labrang, more than a thousand Tibetan people and monks from the monastery gathered on the banks of the Xiahe River to perform equestrian shooting and dances to welcome the anti-epidemic team. After another part of the detachment arrived in Xining City, in addition to a grand welcoming party held by the city, a forum was also held for representatives of traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine, and local health authorities to exchange information on epidemic diseases and medical experiences in ethnic minority areas. The detachment will first go to semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas to conduct medical treatment and health education in the coming days, and will also assist the provincial government in holding short-term training courses for health personnel in Xining City. Following the visit of the Northwest Ethnic Groups Visiting Delegation to express their regards, the central government has again dispatched an anti-epidemic team with a large quantity of medicines to provide free health care, in order to improve the health of the people of all ethnic groups. The people of all ethnic groups have expressed their gratitude to the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao for their kind concern.
