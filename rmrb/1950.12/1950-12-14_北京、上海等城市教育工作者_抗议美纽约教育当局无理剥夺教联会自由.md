    抗议美纽约教育当局无理剥夺教联会自由
    【新华社十二日讯】中国教育工会全国委员会为响应教育工作者工会国际书记处六月七日发表的对美国纽约教育当局剥夺纽约教育工作者工会自由的宣言，于十月二十一日发出通知，号召各地教育工作者签名，抗议美国纽约教育当局的无理措施。教育工作者工会国际书记处的宣言指出，美国纽约州教育当局于本年六月一日无理剥夺纽约教员联合会的自由和权利，并免除教员联合会负责人纽约大学教授李德曼等八位教授的职务；他们并受到纽约教育局长无理的审问，被询以是否与美国共产党有“合伙嫌疑”？这八位教授都是从事教育多年而成绩卓著的教育工作者。宣言号召各国教育工作者支持纽约教员联合会，展开国际互助运动。中国教育工会全国委员会根据教育工作者工会国际书记处所规定的办法，印制抗议的明信片，征求教育工作者签名。据该会收到北京、天津、上海、西安等城市的初步统计，参加签名的已有五万九千三百零二人。各地教育工作者签名抗议的明信片，已陆续由该会汇寄美国纽约州教育局。
