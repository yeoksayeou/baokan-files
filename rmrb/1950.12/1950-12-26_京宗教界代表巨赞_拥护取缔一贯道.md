    Beijing Religious Representative Ju Zan
    Endorses the Banning of Yiguandao
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Ju Zan, the religious representative from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Beijing People's Representative Conference, supports the People's Government's banning of reactionary secret societies such as Yiguandao. He stated:
    We Buddhists are very grateful for the wise measures taken by the People's Government to ban Yiguandao and other feudal reactionary secret societies, and we wholeheartedly support this action. Although Yiguandao is not a branch of Buddhism, counter-revolutionary elements have used Yiguandao to falsely use the name of Buddhism, and even to associate with Buddhist doctrines, to carry out vicious propaganda. On the one hand, they deceive the masses, and on the other hand, they undermine Buddhism. They colluded with the special agent organizations of Japanese invaders, Chinese traitors, and Kuomintang reactionaries to engage in activities that undermined the interests of the people and the country. We Buddhists, standing on the side of the people, say that Yiguandao is the enemy of our people, and from the perspective of religion, Yiguandao is also the enemy of Buddhism. In the past, under the rule of the reactionaries, we had no way to defeat it. Now the People's Government has taken decisive action to eliminate the scourge for the people and also helped Buddhists to defeat a major enemy; therefore, we Buddhists feel especially happy.
    Yiguandao is not a religion; it has no leader, no definite history, and no fixed doctrines or scriptures. It is only a feudal reactionary organization that deceives the masses and harms the people. The People's Government's banning of Yiguandao and other reactionary secret societies is precisely to safeguard the principle of freedom of religious belief. All true religious believers should support the government's action with practical actions. I hope that Buddhists in Beijing and Buddhists across the country will recognize their position and, together with all the people, assist the government in thoroughly banning Yiguandao.

    京宗教界代表巨赞
    拥护取缔一贯道
    【本报讯】中国人民政治协商会议和北京市各界人民代表会议的宗教界代表巨赞拥护人民政府取缔一贯道等反动会道门，发表谈话称：
    我们佛教徒对于人民政府取缔一贯道等封建反动会道门的贤明措施，非常感激，我们全心全意拥护这一行动。一贯道虽然不是佛教的一个支派，但反革命分子却利用一贯道假借佛教的名义，乃至附会佛教教理，进行恶毒的宣传。一方面欺骗群众，一方面破坏佛教。他们和日寇汉奸国民党反动派的特务组织相勾结，从事破坏人民和国家利益的活动。我们佛教徒站在人民的立场上说：一贯道是我们人民的敌人，站在宗教的立场上看，一贯道又是佛教的敌人。过去在反动派统治时期，我们没法打倒它。现在人民政府采取断然的行动，替人民除祸害，也帮助佛教徒打倒了一个大敌人；因此我们佛教徒格外感到欢喜。
    一贯道并不是一种宗教，它没有教主，没有确实的历史，也没有一定的教理和经典，它只是一种欺骗群众为害人民的封建反动组织。人民政府取缔一贯道等反动会道门，正是维护宗教信仰自由的原则。凡是真正的宗教信仰者，应该用实际行动拥护政府这一行动。我希望北京市的佛教徒与全国的佛教徒认清自己的立场，和全体人民一道，协助政府彻底取缔一贯道。
