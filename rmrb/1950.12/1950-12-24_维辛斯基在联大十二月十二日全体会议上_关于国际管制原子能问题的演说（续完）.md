I would also like to mention another feature of this plan.

The American plan stipulates that the United States is guaranteed a majority in this organization. As the actual situation shows, this majority will unconditionally support all US measures in this regard. The experience of the United Nations shows what happens, for example, when a majority consisting of members of the North Atlantic Alliance controls the majority in an international organization.

In such a situation, any country must naturally be completely dependent on American monopoly enterprises. Under the guise of this fictitious so-called international control organization, they will derive all kinds of benefits from the situation they have created, mainly being able to prevent any other country that might become a strong competitor to American monopoly capitalists in the world market from developing their national economy. To prove that this danger really exists, I can quote an article by High Tower, the diplomatic commentator for the Associated Press, who wrote: The fierce atomic energy competition between the Soviet Union and the West stems from the future development prospects of atomic energy. ...He wrote: There is a strong feeling that the Soviets see atomic energy as a springboard that will enable them to catch up with the West in terms of industrial development.

It can be seen from this that American monopoly capitalists are afraid that the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes may achieve such a speed and scope in the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union will use atomic energy as a springboard to surpass the West in industrial development.

The New York Post also recently stated that from the perspective of the White House and the State Department, there is another obstacle in resolving the atomic energy issue, namely the Soviet Union's intention to establish a network of atomic power stations for peaceful purposes.

Therefore, High Tower wrote, the Soviets intend to skip the age of steam and electricity and immediately surpass the West.

He undoubtedly means the United States. We can say that we do not hide our intention to catch up with and surpass other industrially developed countries in all aspects of industrial development, and we have achieved considerable success in this regard.

We cannot promise to stop working in this direction in the future.

But this frightens American monopoly capitalists, and their fears have been expressed in American newspapers and in statements at this assembly by people who do not hide this danger—the danger of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes and not for war purposes.

From the point of view of whether the American plan can truly accomplish the purposes and tasks it formally stipulates, we should say that the situation of the American plan in this direction is also completely unsatisfactory.
If the United States and Britain are really working to ban atomic weapons
They should explicitly prohibit them in accordance with Soviet proposals
I would like to remind you of one thing: Mr. Austin, the official representative of the United States, stated at the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee in New York in 1949: "If an international agency owns and manages atomic energy enterprises, then when the situation reaches a desperate juncture, countries may once again seize this possible explosive in a predatory manner."

In this case, this basic and important provision in the plan regarding the transfer of ownership of atomic energy enterprises and all atomic materials to the international control agency is meaningless. Indeed, the drafters of the American plan believe that the main guarantee of control lies in establishing ownership by an international agency. But if ownership cannot guarantee this control, then what is the point of transferring atomic energy enterprises and atomic materials to the international control agency? In this case, the demands of the defenders of the American plan become unjustified, and they demand that countries forget their sovereignty and give the international control agency such extensive rights as ownership of atomic energy.

It is interesting to point out that the report of the Atomic Energy Commission stipulates that the international control agency has the right to conduct so-called scientific research in the development and use of atomic weapons, and for this purpose allocates a large number of scientific researchers, consultants, experts, professors, special equipment, etc. to the international control agency. So, what is the situation? The international control plan is presented to us as the best way to ban atomic weapons. At the same time, Mr. Chairman, you can verify what I said. Open the second report and you will see what I want everyone to pay attention to, written in black and white. You may have forgotten, so I would like to remind you of this. Really, this is an extremely serious issue, a top priority issue. Take a look, please take a look, open this report, take a look, and you will find exactly the same provisions as stated here: According to your proposal, the international control agency, ostensibly responsible for ensuring the prohibition of atomic weapons, will have scientific research personnel specializing in studying various issues related to the development of atomic weapons and the use of atomic weapons!

But if the international control agency that prohibits atomic weapons itself has the right to manufacture atomic weapons, then what kind of supervision is this over the international control agency that prohibits atomic weapons? What is the purpose of this so-called supervisory agency that prohibits atomic weapons from manufacturing atomic weapons? What will be the result that meets the legitimate demands of all people, the demands of the people's conscience, sincerity, and good faith—the demand for the prohibition of atomic weapons?

The proposal entitled "Uniting for Peace" adopted by the General Assembly on November 17 states: International control established in accordance with the American plan is an effective way to prohibit the use of atomic energy for war purposes. In view of the above, this statement is false.

If the Anglo-American bloc, which forced the General Assembly to pass this proposal, is really working to ban atomic weapons, then, as the Soviet delegation suggested in its proposal, it should directly state the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Soviet delegation has insisted on this and continues to insist on it. From the above, it can be clearly seen that the reason for the impasse on the atomic energy issue created by the Anglo-American bloc, which the Australian representative spoke of so lightly here, lies in this.
The control plan proposed by the Soviet Union is in line with the interests of mankind
It is necessary to strictly supervise the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons
The reason for the impasse lies in the unfortunate fact that American monopoly enterprises and the executive committee of American monopoly capitalists—the American government—are unwilling to ban atomic weapons, and for this purpose have invented various methods to circumvent the need to deal with this issue in the way it should be dealt with. All kinds of slander are cast upon our plan, the Soviet plan (which is said to be worthless).

But this seems to be so far from the truth that even the London Times recently pointed out:—I am now quoting the Times—the Soviet plan is not so hopeless as to abandon all further negotiations, and the American plan is clearly not so practical as not to need to be modified. The plan proposed by the Soviet Union proceeds from the necessity of unconditionally prohibiting atomic weapons and at the same time establishing strict international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition. It stipulates the establishment of an international control committee within the framework of the Security Council system. This committee will have quite extensive powers and supervisory powers to ensure that this committee exercises effective international powers. This completely refutes the claim that the Soviet Union opposes granting such powers to the international control agency and opposes effective supervision.

There is a document in the materials of the Atomic Energy Commission—the suggestions submitted by the Soviet delegation on June 11, 1947—this document stipulates in detail the powers of the international control agency. What are these powers? Let me briefly list them: to conduct regular inspections of enterprises that obtain atomic raw materials, produce atomic materials, and atomic energy. Someone said: You only allow regular inspections, while we want constant inspections. Yes, you want a lot. You want to give that agency ownership of all atomic materials and carry out inspections in the name of this agency. But we say: regular inspections are completely sufficient, and, whenever the international control agency deems it necessary, inspections will be carried out regardless of whether the relevant government is willing or not. This is what our proposal says.

In addition, there are inspections of these enterprises through investigations of the activities of atomic energy enterprises; inspections of existing storage of atomic materials, materials, and semi-finished products; supervision of compliance with the technical utilization regulations stipulated in the control convention; the right to collect and study materials on the acquisition and production of atomic materials and atomic energy; conduct special investigations when there is suspicion that a country has violated the convention banning atomic weapons; and submit recommendations to the Security Council, asking it to take measures to warn and stop countries that violate the convention banning atomic weapons and control.

These are very extensive powers.

Let's start from these! Let's start from these! Let us begin by establishing an inspection system that will enjoy all powers, or at the same time, let us pass suggestions on the prohibition of atomic weapons, suggestions on the prohibition of the production of atomic bombs.

Section 7 of this document of June 11, 1947 gave the International Control Committee a lot of inspections and a lot of power; at any time, it can enter and exit any enterprise to inspect the acquisition, production, and storage of atomic materials and the use of atomic energy; study the production situation in atomic energy enterprises to the extent necessary for controlling the use of atomic materials; estimate the quantities and make various analyses of atomic materials, various materials, and semi-finished products; require and verify information and reports on atomic energy enterprises from national governments; and so on.

When the question of the clear definition of these powers was raised in the Atomic Energy Commission, when the British representative, Mr. Cadogan, raised these questions to our representative in writing, we replied with a memorandum on September 5, 1947, in which all these questions were resolved, and it was specifically pointed out under what conditions these "special investigations" could be carried out when doubts arose.

The memorandum stated that such investigations could be carried out under the following circumstances.

First, a report is submitted by the government of one or more countries;

Second, the International Control Committee itself makes a decision based on discrepancies between existing pure ore and statistical materials or based on reports from inspectors of the International Control Committee.

Is all this not enough?

The Soviet proposals and its plan are fully in line with the basic and vital interests of all peace-loving peoples and all mankind.

This can be judged from the firm demands on this issue from all over the world.
The prohibition of atomic weapons is the voice of the people's conscience
Atomic energy should serve entirely for peaceful purposes
All honest people in the world oppose atomic weapons, this aggressive, barbaric weapon of mass destruction of the people and wanton destruction of entire cities, as well as various other major weapons designed for mass destruction of the people.

The Second World Peace Congress, which just closed in Warsaw, recently convened by Attlee and his government in London and Britain, also put forward the requirement of "unconditional prohibition of all atomic weapons, bacterial and chemical weapons, poisonous gas, radioactive weapons and other instruments of mass destruction of mankind; declaring the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal" among many of the most important decisions.

The Second World Peace Congress declared in its resolution that "control over the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, as well as control over conventional armaments and disarmament, is technically feasible."

The congress resolution stated: "In order to be effective, this control should not only apply to the army, to the existing armaments and armaments production declared by each country, but also, at the request of the International Control Committee, supervise the planned army and the existing armaments and armaments production outside the declaration."

The conference appealed to us, appealed to the United Nations. But what the conference appealed to the United Nations is to not let the peoples of all countries down on their hopes for it, and to effectively fulfill its responsibility to strengthen and develop peaceful cooperation among all countries.

This is the voice of the conscience of millions of people. Atomic energy should serve entirely for peaceful purposes. It should be used to promote the welfare of many countries, should be used to strengthen their dynamic economy and economic strength, which constitutes the foundation for further strengthening and developing all means to ensure the material safety of millions of people.

The work in this regard currently being carried out in the Soviet Union shows that the production of thermal and electrical energy based on pure ore is undoubtedly beneficial, and shows the prospect of guaranteeing that many and many countries in the world have full possibilities to move forward more vigorously along the road of progress.

Only the only path pointed out by the Soviet Union, that is, the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the simultaneous implementation of strict international control, can guarantee the elimination of the threat of new wars and strengthen peace and security among countries.

In accordance with the above principles, the Soviet delegation then put forward a proposal suggesting that the United Nations General Assembly should declare:

"Considering that it is necessary to immediately begin drafting a draft convention on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the control of atomic energy, it is decided that

(1) Notify the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission to resume its work in order to immediately begin drafting a draft convention on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and a draft convention on international control of atomic energy, the intention being to enable these two conventions to be concluded and implemented simultaneously.

(2) The draft convention mentioned in the first section should be drafted and submitted to the Security Council before June 1, 1951."

Our proposal advocates the immediate resumption of the work of preparing the above-mentioned conventions, thereby making another effort to free this issue from the dead end into which it has been driven by the Anglo-American bloc.

### 维辛斯基在联大十二月十二日全体会议上  关于国际管制原子能问题的演说（续完）

专栏：

    维辛斯基在联大十二月十二日全体会议上
    关于国际管制原子能问题的演说（续完）
    我也愿说一下这一计划的又一特点。
    美国计划规定：在这一机构中美国保证可以得到多数。像实际情况所表明的那样，这个多数将无条件地支持美国在这一方面的一切措施。联合国的经验说明，例如说，当北大西洋联盟盟员国组成的多数派在国际性组织中控制多数的时候，那么就会发生怎样的结果。
    在这样情况下，任何国家自然都一定要完全依赖美国垄断企业。他们在这个架空的所谓国际管制机构的掩饰下，将从所造成这种局面中获得各种各样的利益，主要是就能够阻止可能在世界市场上成为美国垄断资本家之劲敌的任何其他国家发展它们的民族经济。为了证明这种危险确实存在，我可以引述美联社外交评论员海托华的一篇文章，他写道：苏联与西方间的剧烈的原子能竞争，根源于原子能未来的发展前途。……他写道：有一种强烈的感觉，即苏联人认为原子能是使他们能够在工业发展方面赶上西方的跳板。
    由此可见，美国独占资本家恐怕用于和平用途的原子能发展可能在苏联获得这样的速度与范围，以至苏联将利用原子能作为在工业发展方面胜过西方的跳板。
    纽约邮报最近也说，从白宫和国务院的观点看起来，在解决原子能问题方面，还有一个障碍，这就是苏联打算建立供和平之用的原子站网。
    因此，海托华写道，苏联人打算跨过蒸汽和电力时代，而立即超过西方。
    他的意思无疑是指美国而言。我们可以说，我们毫不隐讳我们的确想在工业发展的各方面赶上并超过其他工业发达国家的意向，我们在这方面已获得相当的成就。
    我们不能答应将来停止朝这一方向努力。
    但这就吓坏了美国的独占资本家，他们的恐惧已由不隐讳这种危险——和平利用原子能，为和平用途而不为战争用途利用原子能的危险——的人们在美国报纸上和在此间大会的声明中都表现出来了。
    从美国计划是否能确实完成它所正式规定的目的与任务的观点看来，这个计划究竟有效到什么程度，关于这一问题，我们应当说，美国计划在这一方向的情况也是丝毫不满人意的。
  美英如真为禁止原子武器努力
  就该依照苏联的建议表明禁用
    我想提醒你们一件事情：美国正式代表奥斯汀先生于一九四九年在纽约联合国第四届大会政治委员会上发表声明说：“如果某一个国际机构拥有并管理原子能企业，那么在局势将到绝望关头时各国就可能以攫夺的方式再次把这可能的爆炸品抢到手中。”
    在这种情况下，这个计划中关于将原子能企业及一切原子原料的所有权交给国际管制机构的这一基本的和重要的规定就毫无意义了。真的，美国计划的起草人认为管制的主要保证就在于确立国际机构的所有权。但如果所有权，不能保证这种管制的话，那么把原子企业和原子原料移交给国际管制机构还有什么意义呢？在这种情况下，美国计划的辩护者们的要求就成为毫无理由，他们要求各国忘却它们的主权而给国际管制机构以诸如原子能所有权这种广泛的权利。
    指出这样一件事是很有趣味的，就是，原子能委员会的报告规定国际管制机构有权在原子武器的发展和使用方面进行所谓科学研究，并为了这个目的而拨给国际管制机构以很多的科学研究工作者、顾问、专家、教授、特别装备等。那么，情形是怎样呢？国际管制的计划却是当做禁止原子武器的最好的方法而提到我们面前的。同时，主席先生，你可以核对一下我所说的话。打开第二个报告，你就会看到我要大家注意的白纸黑字写的东西。你们可能已忘记了，因此我想提醒你们注意这件事。真的，这是极其严重的问题，是头等重要的问题。看一下吧，麻烦一下看看吧，打开这个报告，看一下，你就会发现和在这里说过的一模一样的规定：根据你们的提案，表面上负责保证禁止原子武器的国际管制机构将拥有科学研究人员专门研究有关发展原子武器，使用原子武器的各种问题！
    但是假使禁止原子武器的国际管制机构自身有权制造原子武器的话，那么这算什么监督禁止原子武器国际管制机构呢？这个所谓监督禁止原子武器的国际机构制造原子武器究竟是为了什么目的呢？符合所有人民的正当要求，人民与人类的良心与诚意的要求——禁止原子武器的要求又会有什么结果呢？
    大会十一月十七日通过的名叫“以行动谋和平”的提案说：按照美国计划建立的国际管制乃是禁止将原子能用于战争用途的有效方法。鉴于上述情况，这种说法是虚妄的。
    假使强迫大会通过这个提案的美英集团真正在为禁止原子武器而努力，那么，就应该如同苏联代表团在它的提案中所建议的那样，直接说明禁止原子武器。苏联代表团曾经坚持，而且继续坚持这一点。从以上所述，可以清楚地看出澳大利亚代表在这里这样轻描淡写地谈过的美英集团所造成的原子能问题的僵局，其原因就在于此。
  苏联提出的管制计划符合人类利益
  必须严格监督无条件禁止原子武器
    僵局的原因就在于这样一种不幸的事实，就是：美国垄断企业与美国垄断资本家的执行委员会——美国政府，是不愿意禁止原子武器的，并且为这种目的而发明了各种方法以便规避按应当采取的方式处理这个问题的必要性。对于我们的计划苏联的计划（这个计划据说是毫无价值的），就施以各种各样的诽谤。
    但是，这看来竟与事实如此大相径庭，甚至伦敦泰晤士报最近也指出：——我现在引用泰晤士报的话说——苏联的计划并不那样毫无希望的，至于要放弃一切进一步的谈判，而美国计划显然并不是如此实际可行而不需要加以修改。苏联所提出的计划是从无条件禁止原子武器并同时建立严格国际管制以监督这种禁令之实行的必要性出发的。它规定在安全理事会的体制以内建立国际管制委员会。这个委员会将拥有颇为广泛的权力与监督权以保证这个委员会行使有力的国际权力。这完全驳倒了硬说苏联反对授与国际管制机构这种权力，并反对有效监督的说法。
    原子能委员会的材料中有一个文件——苏联代表团在一九四七年六月十一日提出的建议——这个文件详细地规定了国际管制机构的权力。这些权力是什么呢？我且简单地把它列举出来：定期检查得到原子原料、生产原子物资和原子能的企业。有人说：你们只允许定期的检查，而我们则希望经常的检查。是的，你们想要的东西很多。你们想使那个机构拥有一切原子物资的所有权，而以这个机构的名义来实行检查。但是我们说：有定期的检查就完全够了，并且，只要在国际管制机构认为有必要时，就不管有关政府愿不愿意都进行检查，这就是真正的检查。我们的建议所说的就是这样。
    此外还有通过调查原子能企业的活动来检查这些企业；检验已有的原子材料、物资和半制品的贮存；监督遵守管制公约所规定的技术利用条例的情形；有权搜集并研究关于取得和生产原子物资和原子能的材料；遇有怀疑某国违反禁用原子武器的公约时，进行特别调查；向安全理事会提出建议，请其采取措施警告并制止违反禁用原子武器和管制公约的国家。
    这些都是非常广泛的权力。
    就从这些作起吧！让我们就从这些作起吧！让我们就从建立将享有一切权力的检查制度开始，或者与此同时，让我们通过关于禁止原子武器的建议，禁止生产原子弹的建议吧。
    一九四七年六月十一日的这个文件中有七节给予了国际管制委员会很多的检查很多的权力；随时可以出入任何企业去检查原子物资之取得、生产和贮存以及原子能之使用；在为管制原子物资的使用所必需的范围内研究原子能企业中的生产情形；对原子物资，各种物资以及半制品估计份量并作各种分析；要求从各国政府得到关于原子能企业的情报与报告，并且加以核对；等等。
    当关于这些权力的明确定义的问题在原子能委员会中提出的时候，当英国代表贾德干先生以书面向我国代表提出这些问题的时候，我们于一九四七年九月五日以一份备忘录作了答复，所有这些问题都在其中获得解决，并且特别指出遇有疑窦发生时，可以在什么条件下进行这些“特别调查”。
    该备忘录声明：在下述情形之下可以进行这种调查。
    第一、一国或若干国家政府提出报告；
    第二、国际管制委员会本身根据现有纯净矿砂和统计材料之间的不符之处或根据国际管制委员会检查员的报告所作的决定。
    所有这些还不够吗？
    苏联的建议及其计划是充分符合所有爱好和平的人民和全人类的基本切身利益的。
    这可以从世界各地在这个问题上的坚决要求来判断。
  禁用原子武器是人民良心的呼声
  原子能应该完全为和平用途服务
    全世界的所有正直人民都反对原子武器，这个侵略的，大规模毁灭人民的和恣意毁坏整个整个城市的野蛮武器，以及反对其他各种旨在大规模毁灭人民的主要武器。
    艾德礼及其政府不许它在伦敦和英国召开的第二届世界保卫和平大会最近刚在华沙闭幕，许多最重要的决定中也提出了“无条件禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具；宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯”的要求。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会在其决议中宣称，“对禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭人类的武器实行管制，以及对常规军备和裁减军备实行管制，在技术上是可以实现的”。
    大会决议称：“为使其有效起见，这种管制不仅应适用于军队，适用于每一国家所已宣布的现有的军备和军备生产，而且在国际管制委员会的要求之下，并应监督计划中的军队和在宣布以外的现有的军备和军备生产”。
    和大向我们呼吁，向联合国呼吁。但是和大向联合国呼吁的是要联合国不辜负各国人民对它的希望，并且有效地履行它所负的加强并且发展所有各国间的和平合作的责任。
    这是千千万万人民的良心的呼声。原子能应该完全为和平用途服务。它应该用于促进许多国家的福利，应该用于加强他们的动力经济与经济力量，这种力量构成进一步加强与发展一切为保证千百万人民物质安全的手段的基础。
    目前正在苏联进行的这一方面的工作，显示了以纯净矿砂为基础的热能和电能的生产无疑是有利的，并且显示了保证世界许多许多国家都有顺着进步的道路向前作更有力的迈进的充分可能性的前途。
    只有苏联所指出来的唯一道路，即无条件禁止原子武器并同时实行严格的国际管制，才能保证消除新战争的威胁，并加强各国间的和平与安全。
    依照上述的原则，苏联代表团遂提出提案，建议联合国大会应该宣布：
    “由于认为必须立即开始起草关于禁止原子武器及管制原子能的公约草案，决定
    （一）通知联合国原子能委员会恢复其工作，以便立即开始起草关于无条件禁止原子武器的公约草案以及国际管制原子能的公约草案，其用意在于使这两项公约得以订立，并同时付诸施行。
    （二）拟定在第一节中所提到的公约草案，并应在一九五一年六月一日以前提交安全理事会”。
    我们的提案主张立即恢复准备上述公约的工作，从而再作一次努力，使这个问题从英美集团所驱入的死路中解脱出来。
