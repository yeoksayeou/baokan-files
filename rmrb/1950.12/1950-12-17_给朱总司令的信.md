To the Respected Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

The American imperialists have spewed their flames of aggression towards our neighbor Korea, towards our homeland Taiwan, and towards the sacred borders of our Northeast, and after being fiercely attacked by the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the American imperialists still do not repent and attempt to continue expanding the war. All our national opera workers are filled with righteous indignation. In accordance with your instruction: "Resolutely combine the reform of old operas and the creation of new operas closely with the current revolutionary struggle," we will use our artistic weapons to promote the new spirit of patriotism, support our invincible People's Liberation Army in consolidating our sacred national defense, liberate Taiwan and all the territory belonging to our country, stabilize all of Asia, and stop all aggressors attacking the peace-loving people of Asia. The great victory of the People's counter-offensive in North Korea more definitively proves that American imperialism is a "paper tiger" that can be defeated. We firmly believe that the armed warriors of our People's Motherland, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and yourself, will carry on the struggle after defeating Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and complete this new and great historical mission.

The 300,000-strong new opera art army nationwide will use new acting skills, a new stage appearance, and the creation of dramas that are commensurate with the great Chinese people to praise and extol your heroic deeds and those of all commanders and fighters!

The Entire Body of Representatives of the National Opera Work Conference, December 10th

    给朱总司令的信敬爱的朱总司令：
    美帝向我邻邦朝鲜，向我祖国国土台湾，和我东北神圣边疆喷出其侵略火焰，经朝鲜人民军与我人民志愿部队予以猛烈打击，美帝尚不悔祸，企图继续扩大战争，我全国戏曲工作者无不义愤填膺。遵照您的指示：“把旧戏曲改革与新戏曲创造坚决与当前革命斗争紧密结合起来”，用我们的艺术武器高扬新爱国主义精神，支援我无敌人民解放军巩固神圣国防，解放台湾和一切属于我国的国土，安定全亚洲，制止一切向我亚洲和平人民进攻的侵略者。由朝鲜北境人民反攻的伟大胜利，更确定地证明美帝是“纸老虎”，是可以被击破的。深信我人民祖国的武装战士，在毛主席，中国共产党和您的英明领导下，继战胜日帝、蒋匪之后再接再厉，完成这一新的、伟大的历史任务。
    全国三十万新戏曲艺术大军将以新的演技水平、新的舞台面貌，和与伟大中国人民相配合剧曲的创作来表扬、歌颂您和一切指战员的英雄事业！
    全国戏曲工作会议全体代表  十二月十日
