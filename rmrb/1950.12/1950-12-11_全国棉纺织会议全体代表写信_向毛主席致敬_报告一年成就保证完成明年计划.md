    Letter from All Representatives of the National Cotton Textile Conference Paying Respects to Chairman Mao
    Reporting on One Year's Achievements, Guaranteeing Completion of Next Year's Plan
    [This newspaper reports] The National Cotton Textile Conference sent a letter to Chairman Mao to pay their respects. The text is as follows:
    Chairman Mao:
    The National Cotton Textile Conference, including representatives from state-owned and private sectors, labor and capital, from all regions of the country, successfully concluded on December 3rd. The conference formulated the 1951 yarn and cloth production plan, established operating standards adapted to existing conditions, studied methods for improving enterprise management, and established some systems.
    In the past year, the cotton textile industry has gradually improved from a difficult and sustained situation. The cotton yarn production in 1950 reached 97 percent of the highest annual output in the past (1930). Relations between the public and private sectors and between labor and capital have greatly improved. All these achievements were obtained under the correct leadership of you and the Central People's Government. We would like to express our highest respect and gratitude to you.
    During the conference, we listened to Premier Zhou's report on the current situation and tasks for 1951, and Vice Premier Chen's report on financial and economic issues, which further advanced our understanding of the overall situation.
    We firmly assure you that we will complete the 1951 production plan and implement the resolutions of the conference to meet the needs of the broad masses of people and support the actions of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending the country. We also unanimously support Vice Premier Chen's opinion on the unified purchase and sale of yarn and cloth in his report.
    As this conference concludes, we would like to express our infinite enthusiasm, wish you good health, and extend our highest respect!
                                  Respectfully, All Representatives of the National Cotton Textile Conference
                                    December 3, 1950

    全国棉纺织会议全体代表写信
    向毛主席致敬       
    报告一年成就保证完成明年计划
    【本报讯】全国棉纺织会议写信向毛主席致敬，文如下：毛主席：
    包括全国各地区国营私营劳方资方代表的全国棉纺织会议，已于十二月三日胜利闭幕了。会议制定了一九五一年的纱布生产计划，订定了适应现有条件的经营标准，研究了改进管理企业的方法，确定了一些制度。
    一年来，棉纺织工业已经从困难和维持的境况中逐渐好转起来，一九五○年棉纱生产量已达到过去最高年产量（一九三○年）的百分之九十七。公私关系与劳资关系都已有很大的改进。所有这些成绩，是在您和中央人民政府的正确领导下获得的。我们谨向你致崇高的敬意和感谢。
    会议期间，我们听了周总理关于目前形势及一九五一年任务的报告，陈副总理关于财政经济问题的报告，使我们对全局的认识，更进了一步。
    我们坚决向您保证，以完成一九五一年生产计划和贯彻大会决议，来满足广大人民需要并支援抗美援朝保家卫国的行动。我们并一致拥护陈副总理报告中关于统一纱布购销的意见。
    当此大会结束之际，我们谨以无限热忱，祝您康健，并致最崇高的敬礼！
                                  全国棉纺织会议全体代表谨上
                                    一九五○年十二月三日
