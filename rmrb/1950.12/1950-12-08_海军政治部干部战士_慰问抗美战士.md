Naval Political Department Cadres and Soldiers
Comfort Anti-American Fighters

[This newspaper's dispatch] The Youth League members and all cadres and soldiers of the Naval Political Department expressed extreme anger at the mad expansion of aggression by American imperialism, and solemnly swore to the motherland and the Party: "We will never allow the brutal and tyrannical American aggressors to run rampant! We will loyally and actively accelerate the construction of the People's Navy. If the motherland needs us to fight the American aggressors, we will go to the battlefield without a moment's hesitation!" They all signed the oath, and every comrade in the guard squad also stamped their personal seals.

At the same time, each Youth League group launched a warm comfort movement, and non-League comrades also responded enthusiastically. Zhao Yingxi, one of the three female League members who first wrote a letter of comfort, said in her letter: "It's getting cold, wear this sweater and kill more enemies!" The Youth League branch secretary and Youth Committee member of the department personally sewed comfort bags and wrote letters of comfort. Bu Yu, the League branch secretary, wrote in his letter of comfort: "Comrades! Advance bravely! Behind you are 500 million heroic Chinese people, 30 million heroic Korean people, and the support of peace-loving people all over the world! Don't let the enemy run away, give them a complete, thorough, and clean annihilation!" Peng Shuoming sewed the handkerchief awarded to him by the higher authorities into a comfort bag, writing on it: This is a prize I received at the battle achievements exhibition. I sewed it into a comfort bag and sent it to you, hoping that you will work hard to kill the enemy and move from victory to final victory!

    海军政治部干部战士
    慰问抗美战士
    【本报讯】海军政治部青年团员和全体干部、战士对美帝疯狂扩大侵略，表示极端愤怒，一致向祖国、向党庄严宣誓：“我们决不允许凶残横暴的美国侵略者横行！忠诚积极地加速建设人民海军。如果祖国什么时候需要我们和美国侵略者作战，我们将一分钟也不犹豫地走上战场！”他们都在誓词上签了名，警卫班的每个同志还盖上私章。
    各个青年团小组同时热烈展开慰问运动，非团员同志也踊跃响应。最先写慰问信的三个女团员之一赵颖熙在信上说：“天气冷了，穿上这件毛衣，好杀更多的敌人！”该部青年团支书、青委亲自缝慰问袋，写慰问信。团支书卜雨在慰问信上写道：“同志们！英勇地前进！你们后面有五万万英雄的中国人民、三千万英雄的朝鲜人民，以及全世界爱好和平人民的支援！不要让敌人跑了，要给它一个全部、彻底、干净地歼灭！”彭硕明把上级奖给他的手帕缝成慰问袋，上面写着：这是战绩展览会发给我的奖品，我把它缝成慰问袋，送给你们，希望你们努力杀敌，从胜利走向最后胜利！
