    The events in Korea are being watched with deep emotion by all honest people, all loyal peace fighters. The bloody aggression perpetrated by the American imperialists and their vassals in Korea is forcing the peace-loving people of Korea to take up arms. Peaceful people who were diligently building a new life have become fearless warriors, fighting for the dignity and independence of their homeland.
    Progressive Korean writers are also joining the ranks of the defenders of the fatherland. They are contributing all their abilities, serving the motherland together with their people.
    This is not the first time that progressive Korean writers have been forced to take up arms to defend the independence of their country and the right to democratic development. Korean literature has long had its glorious fighting tradition. The Korean people are a people with a rich and ancient culture. When Japan invaded Korea, it tried its best to make the world forget the existence of Korea, avoiding mentioning the name of the country and calling it "Hando" or peninsula in official documents.
    As a result, the outside world knows very little about Korean culture—one of the oldest cultures in the world—or about the Korean people's struggle for independence. The Korean resistance movement is still awaiting its historians to make faithful records and reports.
    Under the influence of the Great October Revolution, the Korean national liberation movement entered a new stage. In 1919, the Korean people rebelled against the Japanese invaders. The uprising was suppressed; the Korean proletariat did not yet have a fighting party capable of leading a national movement. Nevertheless, the events of that year shook the country and forced the Japanese government to make some concessions. But the stingy reforms implemented by the Japanese Governor-General could not deceive the Korean people. On the contrary, the resistance movement became stronger and took on an organized form.
    In 1925, the Korean Proletarian Literary Artists Alliance (KAP) was established. Its core included a group of progressive writers—Li Qiyong, Han Xueye, Lin He, etc., who are all builders of today's Korean literature. Before the birth of the "Alliance", Korean literature was dominated by proponents of "pure art". Under the encouragement of the Japanese invaders, they revived reactionary romanticism, idealized the patriarchal feudal past, or indulged in subtle psychological soul searching, stylistic experimentation, and aestheticism, following the decadent schools of Western Europe and Tokyo. Some of those who called themselves "realists" confined themselves to sentimental descriptions of daily life, trying to get their suffering compatriots to compromise with fate, in other words, to compromise with the Japanese invaders.
    Progressive writers, in the name of true realism, carried out a severe struggle against the proponents of "art for art's sake". In their works, they began to truthfully depict the trampled existence of the Korean people. In his "Hometown", "Poor People", "Holiday Light", and other stories, Li Qiyong described the impoverished peasants languishing under the dual yoke of Japanese and Korean landlords. In his novels "That Night", "Hunger", "Struggle" and "Transformation Period", Han Xueye described how the idea of resistance grew in the hearts of honest intellectuals, and how the joint struggle against the Japanese usurpers brought workers and peasants closer together.
    The Japanese inspection immediately attacked the "Alliance". Most of the manuscripts were banned from publication, and the rest were deleted in large sections or even entire pages. But these banned and distorted novels and poems circulated in manuscripts. Although the police searched for and confiscated them, they could not destroy what had taken root in the hearts of the people.
    The Japanese police, helpless, took other methods to deal with these stubborn writers. In 1934, eighty writers, the backbone of Korean progressive literature, were arrested and tried. The "Alliance" was officially dissolved. But prison could not frustrate the spirit of Korean writers. Confined to solitary confinement without a piece of paper or a pen, they planned the outlines of future works in their hearts.
    For example, Han Xueye's novel "Twilight" was written in this way. This book was conceived entirely in prison, and the author wrote it as soon as he was released. It describes how Japanese capitalists and their Korean lackeys threw tens of thousands of workers into the streets under the pretext of rationalizing industry, causing them to suffer a slow death from starvation. This book also shows how Korean workers worked together to fight for their rights. This novel, like other works conceived in prison by progressive Korean writers, was a great success.
    In 1934, Korean writers were baptized by the flames of war. In this year, the various units of the Korean guerrilla forces in the Northeast united to form the first guerrilla division under the command of General Kim Il Sung.
    The Japanese authorities were not only carrying out these police actions. They attempted to conquer the entire spiritual life of Korea with the help of their servants and thugs. All kinds of "loyal literature" were encouraged in various ways. The works of Li Guangzhu, the leader of the "art for art's sake" camp, were translated into Japanese, published in large quantities, and awarded prizes. The police maintained groups of decadent writers in Seoul, such as Dadaists, Surrealists, and Imagists. Under the protection of the Japanese, they attempted to artificially revive didactic stories, a type of old Korean literature that should have died out long ago. However, the Dadaist masterpieces and the "didactic stories" depicting experienced young people who passed the Confucian examinations and finally became successful rarely succeeded among Korean readers. Progressive readers were more interested in young people in prison and on the front lines of guerrilla warfare, because these young people were passing a much more glorious examination that earned them the title of Korean patriots.
    In 1940, the Japanese government took the final and most drastic measure: banning the Korean language. Elementary school students were punished for saying a word in Korean. It was illegal to write anything in Korean. Except for a small group of decadents who immediately accepted the ban on their native language and began writing on topics provided by the Korean Governor-General, Korean writers decided that they would rather not write a word than write in Japanese. These writers who refused to cooperate with the Japanese participated in underground activities or joined the guerrillas. Li Qiyong, the veteran Korean poet and prose writer with a slender figure, a philosopher-like face, and fingers as flexible as a musician, farmed rice, sorghum, and opened rivers like an ordinary poor peasant. He preferred a life of hardship and difficulty rather than being a slave of the Japanese.
    In August 1945, the Soviet Red Army entered Korea and defeated the Japanese imperialists. The Korean people gained freedom, and their literature was revived. The Federation of Literary and Art Workers was soon established in North Korea. Its leaders were Li Qiyong, Han Xueye, Li Fuming, and other outstanding progressive writers who had been holding high the banner of serving the people during the cruel years of twenty years of uninterrupted struggle against the Japanese invaders.
    The literature of resistance turned into the literature of democratic construction. The working people of Korea completely broke away from the past and began a new life. Men and women who had only recently been oppressed by the Japanese and were now masters of their own country gradually awakened to a new consciousness and made remarkable achievements in all undertakings. This was a truly inspiring topic for Korean writers. There are many works on this topic, two of the most outstanding of which are Li Qiyong's "Land" and "Flooding", which describe how quickly the Korean countryside has prospered since the land reform in 1946 and how the psychology of the peasants is changing. In the novel "Soil", the outstanding novelist Li Taijun describes the poverty of peasant life under Japanese rule and the fundamental changes that have taken place in the countryside since liberation. In works depicting workers' lives, they show how they master new technologies and new labor methods, how they carry out labor competitions, achieve success, and become men and women of the new era. Here, the first to be mentioned should be the stories "Mining Town" and "Brothers and Sisters" by Han Xueye, one of the founders of Korean progressive literature; Li Fuming's "The Sound of a Newborn Land" and "Patriots"; Choi Myong lk's "Machine"; and "Coal Truck" by a young writer named Hwan Gon.
    During the Japanese occupation, they did everything they could to force Koreans to forget their country's history and extinguish their national self-esteem. The youth of free Korea must know the past of their people, they must know their national heroes, especially the history of the national liberation movement. Therefore, Korean writers turned to historical themes, expressing them in connection with the present. In a monumental novel, Han Xueye wrote about the events from the beginning of this century until the liberation of Korea. Kim Tae-cheon wrote a historical drama dedicated to Yi Sun-sin, the 16th-century naval commander, a great man who organized the people to resist the Japanese, and who finally defeated the enemy. "Mount Palgong" is a novel by Choi Myong-ik that describes the struggle of Korean peasants against the Japanese invaders; the theme of "Guerrilla" by young writer Qian Qingsong is the activities of Korean guerrillas during the resistance movement; Zhao Jitian's collection of poems "Mount Baekdu" and Han Mingjun's "North Jiandao" have the same theme. The occupation by the Japanese invaders has ended, but in South Korea, the people continue to resist their new oppressors—the American imperialists and their accomplices. This is the theme of Li Taijun's story "The First Battle", Wu Zhanghuan's poem "Resistance", Lin He's "Hymn" and other works.
    The friendship between the Soviet people and the Korean people is a theme that occupies a special place in the works of Korean writers. Two collections of prose and poetry published last year, entitled "Great Contribution" and "Eternal Friendship", were selected from the works of many old and young writers.
    Korean writers in their works depict a deep love for the Soviet Union and for the leaders of all progressive humanity, Lenin and Stalin.
    When the Soviet soldiers withdrew from Korea, the poet An Longwan wrote a farewell poem:
    Goodbye, goodbye, son of "October",
    Goodbye, goodbye, giant among men,
    Bring us happiness and joy,
    And freedom, forever...
    Korean poets have written many poems praising Kim Il Sung, a national hero and people's leader from a peasant background. His name has become the banner of united Korea in struggle.
    Although rejoicing in the joy of newfound freedom, Korean poets have not forgotten the terrible past. Nor have they forgotten what the American occupation forces have done in South Korea. Now the Korean people hate the American aggressors more than they ever hated the Japanese invaders. The poet Bai Renjun said in his poem "Hatred":
    Day and night,
    Beasts trample on our garden,
    Our flowers...
    ………………
    I face their mouths,
    The mouths that are always chewing their chewing gum,
    Facing their eyes,
    The eyes that pretend to be gentlemen,
    Spit out my hatred and revenge!
    Another poet, Qian Songwang's poem "The Trial Is Coming", calls for revenge against the American aggressors.
    After the liberation of North Korea, many new writers appeared in the literary world. The Federation of Literary and Art Workers believes that cultivating new talents is the primary task. And the development of mass talent has indeed enriched Korean literary life. "Alliance" branches have been established in all cities and provinces (do), forming a dense network of literary and artistic groups in various factories and farms. These branches had 8,000 members last year. The "Writers Association" plays a leading role in the "Alliance".
    Classical and modern Russian literature has long been well known in Korea. Many works by Russian writers were introduced to Korean readers in the 1920s. After 1945, Soviet literature was able to be accessed by the general public. The works of Gorky, Mayakovsky, Fadeyev, Simonov, Nikolai Ostrovsky, Grossman, Isakovsky, and many other writers have been translated into Korean. Kornechuk's play "Platon Krechet" has become a hot show in the repertoire of professional and amateur theater troupes and a favorite of Korean audiences.
    Korean writers have made many efforts to bring literature closer to the masses. The cumbersome and complex hieroglyphs have been abandoned, and books are now written in phonetic script, which makes it easier for the masses to access.
    However, the prosperity of literary life is only in North Korea. In South Korea, under the rule of the American puppet Li Chengwann, literature is lifeless, just like in the era of Japanese Governor-General rule. The American military authorities have banned works that describe the despotism and tyranny of the Japanese occupation. For example, the play "Summer Grain" by the famous playwright Han Shifu is one of them, which describes how the Japanese drove Koreans off their land. Due to the pursuit of the thugs of Li Chengwann's terrorist gang, patriotic writers have to hide as before. Lin He, the father of Korean proletarian poetry, is fighting heroically alongside Zhao Xinzhu, Han Xinshi, and others in the South Korean guerrillas. Many other famous writers, including Li Taijun and Wu Zhanghuan, were forced to flee to North Korea. Those in power in South Korea do not need literature.
    During this cruel period when the entire people have risen up to resist the American aggressors and Li Chengwann's lackeys and are waging a sacred war, Korean writers face a great and glorious task. As in the period of Japanese rule, the best Korean writers have repeatedly raised their voices in anger, exposing the heinous war criminals' barbarous bombing of peaceful cities and the massacre of defenseless women and children.
    Korean writers, together with the entire people, are tenaciously defending the freedom and independence of their country. In their brave and fearless struggle, they have received the warm support and sympathy of freedom-loving people all over the world.

    战斗朝鲜的文学
    罗曼诺夫斯基  
    一切正直的人民，一切忠实的和平战士，都怀着深切的感情注视着朝鲜的事件。美帝国主义者及其附庸在朝鲜进行血腥的侵略，迫使朝鲜爱好和平的人民拿起武器。辛勤建设新生活的和平人民变成了大无畏的战士，为祖国的尊严和独立而斗争。
    朝鲜的进步作家也参加了祖国保卫者的行列。他们贡献出他们的全部能力，和他们的人民一同服务于祖国。
    朝鲜进步作家被迫拿起武器来保卫祖国的独立，和民主发展的权利，这并不是第一次。朝鲜文学早有它的光荣的战斗传统。朝鲜人是有丰富古远的文化的人民。日本侵占朝鲜的时候，极力要使全世界忘掉朝鲜的存在，避免提到这个国家的名字，在官家的文件上把它叫作“韩岛”或半岛。
    因此外界对朝鲜的文化——世界上最古文化之一——或者对朝鲜人民为独立而进行的斗争，知道得就很少。朝鲜人的反抗运动还有待于它的历史家作忠实的记录和报导。
    在伟大的十月革命影响之下，朝鲜的民族解放运动进入新的阶段。一九一九年，朝鲜人民曾经反叛日本侵略者。这次起义被镇压了；朝鲜无产阶级还没有一个能够领导全国规模的运动的战斗的政党。虽然如此，那一年的事件震撼了全国，并且迫使日本政府作了某些让步。但是日本总督所实行的吝啬的改革，并不能欺骗朝鲜人民。正相反，抵抗运动更强烈了，并且采取了有组织的形式。
    一九二五年，朝鲜无产阶级文学艺术联盟（ＫＡＰ）成立了。它的核心包括一群进步作家——李簊永、韩雪野、林和等等，他们都是今天的朝鲜文学的建造者。在“联盟”诞生以前，朝鲜文学是被“纯艺术”的提倡者们所支配的。他们在日本侵入者鼓励之下复活了反动的浪漫主义，把家长制的封建的过去加以理想化，或者沉醉于微妙的心理学的灵魂探索，风格的试验，和唯美主义，追随着西欧和东京的颓废派。其中有些自称为“现实主义者”的人们把自己局限于日常生活的感伤的描写，想叫他们受难的同胞和命运妥协，换句话说，和日本侵入者妥协。
    进步的作家们，在真正的现实主义的名义之下，对“为艺术而艺术”的提倡者们进行了严酷的斗争。他们在作品里开始详实地描写朝鲜人民的被践踏的生存。李簊永在他的《故乡》，《穷人》，《假日之光》，和其他故事里，描写穷苦不堪的农民在日本和朝鲜地主的双重羁轭之下憔悴下去。韩雪野在他的小说《那一天的夜里》，《饥饿》，《斗争》和《转形期》里，描写了反抗的思想如何在正直的知识分子心中生长，对日本篡夺者的联合斗争如何使工人和农民更密切结合。
    日本人的检查立刻就向“联盟”下手了。稿件的大部分都被禁止出版，其余的是大段大段的甚至整页的被删。但是这些被查禁的和被歪曲的小说和诗歌，由手抄本流通着。虽然警察搜索和没收它们，却不能够毁灭那在人民的心里扎下深根的东西。
    日本警察无可奈何，就采取另外的方法来对付这些倔强的作家。一九三四年，朝鲜进步文学的骨干有八十位作家被捕受审。“联盟”被正式解散了。但是牢狱并不能够挫折朝鲜作家们的精神。被关在没有一片纸一枝笔的单人监房里，他们就在心里筹划未来的作品的纲要。
    例如韩雪野的小说《黄昏》就是这样写成的。这部书完全是在监狱中构思，作者一出狱马上就写出来的。它是描写日本资本家们和他们的朝鲜走狗们，如何在合理化工业的借口之下把几万个工人扔到大街上，使他们遭受饥饿的慢性死亡。这本书也表现了朝鲜的工人们如何同心合力为他们的权利而斗争。这部小说，像其他进步朝鲜作家们在监狱里所构思的作品一样，也是一个伟大的成功。
    一九三四年，朝鲜的作家们受到了战火的洗礼。在这一年，东北的朝鲜游击队的各个单位联合起来，组成金日成将军指挥下的第一个游击师团。
    日本当局并不止是进行这些警察行动而已。他们企图靠着他们的仆从和打手的帮助来征服朝鲜的整个精神生活。一切种种的“忠顺的文学”受到各种鼓励。“为艺术而艺术”的阵营的领袖李光洙的作品被译成日文，大量的发行，并且得奖。警察维护汉城的达达派、超现实派、意象派这些颓废作家们的集团。在日本人的保护之下，他们企图把教训的故事加以人工的复活，这是古旧的朝鲜文学的一种，早已应该自生自灭了的。然而，达达派的杰作和描写老成的青年，通过孔子学说的考试，终于飞黄腾达的《教训故事》，在朝鲜读者中间却绝少成功。进步的读者倒是对在牢里和在游击战争前线上的青年更有兴趣，因为这些青年，所通过的是使他们获得朝鲜爱国者的称号的光荣得多多的考试。
    一九四○年日本政府采取了最后的也是最激烈的手段：禁止了朝鲜语文。小学生说出一句朝鲜话都要受罚。不论用朝鲜文写什么都是犯法的。除了一小撮颓废派立刻接受了对祖国语文的禁令，开始写作朝鲜总督所提供的主题之外，朝鲜作家们都决定宁可一个字不写，也不用日文写作。这些拒绝和日本人合作的作家们就参加地下活动，或投入游击队。李簊永，这位身材瘦小，面貌像哲学家，手指灵活得像音乐家的，老资格的朝鲜诗人和散文作者，像一个普通穷苦农民一样种稻子，种高粱，和开河，这样坚苦不息地劳作了几年。他宁愿过劳苦艰难的生活，不作日本人的奴才。
    一九四五年八月，苏联红军进入朝鲜，击溃日本帝国主义者，朝鲜人民获得了自由，他们的文学也复活了。文学艺术工作者联盟不久就在北朝鲜成立。它的领导分子是李簊永、韩雪野、李福明，和其他的优秀的进步作家们，他们曾经在二十年不间断的同日本侵入者作斗争的残酷年月中，一直高举着为人民服务的旗帜。
    反抗运动的文学变成了民主建设的文学。朝鲜的劳动人民完全摆脱了过去，开始了一个新的生活。只是最近还被日本人压迫而现在成为自己国家的主人的男男女女，渐渐觉醒了新的意识，并且在所有的事业方面都有了显著的成绩。这对于朝鲜的作家们是一个真正的鼓舞的主题。关于这个题目的作品很多，其中有两部最杰出的是李簊永著作的《土地》和《泛滥》，描写了朝鲜的乡村自从一九四六年土地改革以来如何飞快地繁荣起来，农民们的心理如何在改变着。在《泥土》那部小说里，卓越的小说家李泰俊描写在日本人统治之下农民生活的穷困，和自从解放以来乡间所发生的根本改变。在描写工人生活的作品中，显示他们如何掌握新的技术和新的劳动方法，他们如何进行劳动竞赛，获得成功，和成为新时代的男女。这里首先应该提到的是朝鲜进步文学的创始人之一韩雪野所作的故事《矿镇》及《兄弟和姊妹》；李福明的《一块新生的土地的声音》和《爱国者们》；崔明翼（Choi Myong lk）的《机器》；和一个叫作黄昆（Hwan Gon）的年青作家的《运煤车》。
    日本侵入者统治时期，他们尽一切力量强迫朝鲜人忘记他们国家的历史，和扑灭他们的民族自尊感。自由朝鲜的青年一定要知道他们人民的过去，他们必须知道他们的民族英雄，特别是民族解放运动的历史。因此朝鲜作家们转向历史主题，在其与现在的关联上加以表现。韩雪野在一部纪念碑式的小说里写了从本世纪初一直到朝鲜解放这一期间的事件。金泰泉写了一部历史剧，是献给十六世纪海军司令李舜臣的，这是组织人民反抗日本人的一个伟人，而且他终于把敌人打败的。《巴力山》是崔明翼的一部小说，描写朝鲜农民反抗日本侵入者所进行的斗争；青年作家钱青松所著的《游击队》，主题是朝鲜游击队员在反抗运动时期的活动；赵基天的诗集《长白山》和韩明俊的《北间岛》的题材都是如此的。日本侵入者的占领完结了，但是在南朝鲜，人民继续进行反抗他们新的压迫者——美帝国主义者及其同谋者们。这就是李泰俊的故事《第一个战役》、吴章焕的诗《反抗》、林和的《赞美歌》和其他作品的题材。
    苏联人民同朝鲜人民的友谊是在朝鲜作家的作品中占据特殊地位的主题。去年出版了两部散文和诗的选集，题名“伟大的贡献”和“永久的友谊”，就是从许多老作家和青年作家的作品中选出的。
    朝鲜作家们在他们的作品中描写了对苏联和对一切进步人类的领袖列宁、斯大林的深切的热爱。
    诗人安龙湾在苏维埃战士们撤离朝鲜的时候，写了送别诗：
    再会，再会，“十月”的儿子，
    再会，再会，人类中的巨人，
    带给我们幸福和欢乐，
    还有自由，直到永久……
    朝鲜诗人歌颂金日成这位出身农民的民族英雄和人民领袖的诗很多。他的名字已经成了团结的朝鲜在斗争中的旗帜。
    朝鲜诗人虽在新生的自由的欢乐中，并没有忘记可怖的过去。也没有忘记美国占领军在南朝鲜的所作所为。现在朝鲜人民对美国侵略者们的痛恨超过从前对日本侵入者。诗人白仁俊在《仇恨》一诗里说：
    无分昼夜，
    野兽践踏着我们的花园，
    我们的花朵……
    ………………
    我对着他们的嘴巴，
    那永远嚼着他们的橡皮糖的嘴巴，
    对着他们的眼睛，
    那假装着绅士派的眼睛，
    唾骂出我的憎恨和复仇！
    另一位诗人钱松旺的“裁判要到了”一诗，号召对美国侵略者的复仇。
    北朝鲜解放之后，许多新作家出现在文学界了。文艺工作者联盟认为培养新的天才是首要的工作。而群众才能的发扬，的确是丰富了朝鲜的文学生活。所有的城市和省份（道），都成立了“联盟”的分会，在各个工厂和农庄里组成了密布的文艺团体的网。这些分会在去年拥有会员八千人。“作家协会”在“联盟”里起着领导作用。
    古典的和现代的俄罗斯文学在朝鲜是早就被熟知的。俄罗斯作家的许多作品是在二十年代就被介绍给朝鲜读者的。一九四五年之后，苏维埃文学于是能够被一般读者所接触了。高尔基，玛雅可夫斯基，法捷耶夫，西蒙诺夫，尼古来·奥斯托洛夫斯基，格罗斯曼，伊萨可夫斯基，和其他许多作家的作品已经被译成朝鲜文。柯尔涅楚克的剧本《普拉顿·克里契特》成为职业剧团和业余剧团上演节目中的热戏和朝鲜观众心爱的东西。
    朝鲜作家为了使文学和广大群众接近，曾经作了许多努力。烦难复杂的象形文字被摒弃，书籍现在都用拼音文字写，这样就使群众较易于接近。
    但是，文学生活的繁荣只是在北朝鲜。在南朝鲜，在美帝傀儡李承晚的统治之下，文学是死气沉沉，一如日本总督统治的时代。美国军事当局禁止那些描写日本统治时期的专制横暴的作品。例如著名剧作家韩世福的剧本《夏粮》，就是其中之一，这剧本描写了日本人怎样把朝鲜人逐出土地。由于李承晚的恐怖匪帮的打手们的追踪，爱国作家们不得不像从前一样躲藏起来。朝鲜无产阶级诗歌之父林和，在南朝鲜的游击队里与赵新柱、韩新植等人并肩地英勇作战。许多其他名作家，其中有李泰俊、吴章焕，都被迫逃到北朝鲜。在南朝鲜当权的人们是不需要文学的。
    当全体人民起来反抗美国侵略者和李承晚派的奴才们而进行神圣战争的这个残酷的时期，朝鲜作家们面对着一个伟大而光荣的任务。像日本人统治时期一样，朝鲜的第一流作家们一再发出愤怒的声音，暴露可憎的战犯们对和平城市的野蛮轰炸和对不能自卫的妇女儿童的屠杀。
    朝鲜作家们同整个人民一起顽强地保卫着他们国家的自由和独立。在他们的勇敢无畏的斗争中，他们得到全世界爱好自由的人民的热烈支援和同情。
