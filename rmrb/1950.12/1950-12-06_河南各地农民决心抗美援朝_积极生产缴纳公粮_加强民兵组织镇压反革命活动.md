    积极生产缴纳公粮
    加强民兵组织镇压反革命活动
    【新华社开封一日电】河南省各地农民，热烈地展开了抗美援朝保家卫国的各项实际行动。
    各县农民都争先以缴纳好公粮表示自己爱国的热忱。正在颁发土地证的襄城县前纪村农民，都表示只有帮助朝鲜兄弟，打垮美国鬼子的侵略，才保得住自己的好日子。该县侯店乡在农业劳动模范杨春喜带动下，全乡实现了“坏粮不出村”的口号，全都把缴公粮的谷子碾、晒了四遍。宝丰县贾砦乡的农民，也都将公粮谷子碾了四遍。郏县大屯乡农民一致提出“提前五天，一粒不欠，完成入库”的口号。
    各地农民并正在积极生产，增强国家经济力量。郑州市郊区燕庄乡农民的生产计划中，保证要作到“人无闲人，地无荒地”。鲁山县鸡冢乡农民，计划在今年全乡扩大种麦面积八百亩，并每亩地上粪二十担。黄泛区西华县梁南村二百多个妇女，在治颍模范高玉梅带动下，正在大力组织副业生产。
    各地民兵纷纷举行会议，讨论加强民兵的组织和军事训练等问题。洛宁县九区人民武装大队部，召开了二十三个乡中的民兵队长会议，会上一致表示决心把民兵组织、训练工作做好。陈留县举办了民兵训练班，加紧提高军事技术。新安县郭庄乡民兵在会议上一致表示：要坚决负起保卫家乡及社会秩序安定的重大任务。郑州市郊区民兵提出以镇压反革命活动为当前中心任务。开封市郊赵屯乡民兵已加强夜巡，保护铁路和电线。
