Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd. Over three thousand six hundred literary and art workers in Chongqing are enthusiastically launching various literary and artistic creation and propaganda activities to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the nation. Writers, poets, and other literary and art workers have held creative symposiums, planning to complete more than thirty literary and artistic works such as novels, plays, essays, and poems related to resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the nation during the movement, to meet the needs of drama and music workers in carrying out propaganda. More than twenty drama troupes and cultural and art troupes in Chongqing are preparing to stage newly created dramas. Four cultural and art troupes have already begun propaganda activities. The Music Workers Association has received more than thirty newly created songs, and the fifteen music work stations led by the association have gone to factories and rural areas to teach new songs. In celebration of the first anniversary of Chongqing's liberation and to powerfully expose the atrocities of American imperialism, fine arts workers rushed to produce huge cartoons and slogans for street corners and meticulously produced a large number of slides for screening in various cinemas. They also produced one hundred and twenty colored comic strips for the Chongqing Public Security Work Exhibition, exposing the atrocities of the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in massacring revolutionary martyrs and the special agent activities uncovered after liberation. More than one thousand old artists have now begun to perform four newly created Sichuan operas, and the ballads, *zhuizi* (a type of storytelling), *jinyinban* (clapper talk), flower drum, *zhuqin* (bamboo flute) and other forms of performance they sing have been infused with newly created lyrics and melodies for resisting America and aiding Korea.
