    The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has been running prize savings bonds since November 20th. Because they meet the interests and needs of the masses, and are conducive to the state's centralized use of funds, they have been widely supported by citizens from all walks of life and employees of various agencies and organizations, and many are vying to save. The first issue of prize savings certificates, two groups totaling 200,000 numbers, had already received over 170,000 numbers by the 6th of this month. Many citizens requested an early drawing. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has accepted this suggestion and decided to close savings on December 15th and hold the drawing publicly at 1:00 PM on Sunday, December 17th, at the Democratic Theater in Xizhushikou, Qianmenwai. Prizes will be awarded early, starting on the 22nd of this month. As the savings are about to be fully subscribed, those who still wish to save are encouraged to do so as soon as possible.

    第一期有奖储蓄提前开奖
    人民银行北京分行自十一月二十日举办有奖储蓄以来，因切合群众利益与需要，而又有利于国家集中使用资金，深受各界市民及各机关团体职工拥护，多竞相存储。第一期有奖储蓄存单两组共二十万号，截至本月六日止，已收储十七万多号，许多市民要求提前开奖。人民银行北京分行已接受这个意见，决定提前于十二月十五日截止收储，十七日（星期日）下午一时在前外西珠市口民主剧场当众开奖。并自本月二十二日起提前付奖。因收储即将满额，尚欲存储者希赶早往存。
