    Instruction of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Running Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools and Workers' and Peasants' Cadre Cultural Refresher Schools

    I. Worker and peasant cadres are important backbones in building a people's country, but in the long war environment of the past, they had few opportunities to receive systematic cultural education. In order to conscientiously improve their cultural level to meet the needs of the construction cause, the People's Government must give them special educational opportunities and cultivate them into new intellectuals. To this end, it is decided to run workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools and workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools in a planned and step-by-step manner throughout the country, absorbing worker and peasant cadres of varying degrees to give them appropriate cultural education, so as to raise the cultural level of worker and peasant cadres across the country to the equivalent of middle school level within a few years as much as possible.

    II. The length of schooling for workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools is tentatively set at three years, which may be extended if necessary. The curriculum is equivalent to the basic curriculum of ordinary middle schools. The length of schooling for workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools is tentatively set at two years, which may be extended if necessary. The curriculum is equivalent to the basic curriculum of complete primary schools. The curriculum content of these two types of schools must be streamlined as much as possible to meet the needs of national construction and the characteristics of worker and peasant cadres.

    III. Students of workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools and workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools should be transferred or selected by various agencies, factories, and schools in a planned manner. The conditions for entering workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools are: worker and peasant cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years or industrial workers with more than three years of work experience, have a cultural level equivalent to that of a senior primary school graduate, are between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five, and are in good health. The conditions for entering workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools are: worker and peasant cadres who have participated in revolutionary work for more than three years and are over the age of eighteen. When selecting students, all units must recognize the urgent need of worker and peasant cadres for culture and the long-term interests of national construction, and select and send them in accordance with regulations, and must not perfunctorily fill the numbers.

    IV. Workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools and workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools must be equipped with excellent faculty and staff to undertake teaching and school affairs, and provide the necessary equipment.

    V. In order to reward outstanding worker and peasant cadres and industrial workers for enrolling, the military service and work experience of students who leave their jobs to study should continue to be calculated during their study period. After supply-system cadres enroll, their political and material living standards must be maintained at their original standards. Wage-system cadres receive supply-system treatment according to their equivalent grades. Workers receive general supply-system treatment. If students' families have real difficulties in life after enrollment, they may be given appropriate subsidies. The salaries of teachers in workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools and workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools should be slightly higher than the salaries of teachers in local ordinary middle schools and primary schools.

    VI. Workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools will be organized by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the education departments of the major administrative regions. Workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools can be organized by various senior agencies and provincial, municipal, and county people's governments.

    VII. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government should formulate implementation measures for workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools and workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools based on the above principles, announce and implement them, and train teachers and compile teaching materials in a planned manner to meet the needs of the two types of schools. The school system, curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching plans of all workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools and workers' and peasants' cadre cultural refresher schools in the country should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government.

    中央人民政府政务院关于举办工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的指示
    一、工农干部是建设人民国家的重要骨干，但在过去长期战争环境中，他们很少有受系统的文化教育的机会。为了认真提高他们的文化水平以适应建设事业的需要，人民政府必须给予他们以专门受教育的机会，培养他们成为新的知识分子。为此，特决定在全国范围内有计划有步骤地举办工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校，吸收不同程度的工农干部给以适当时间的文化教育，尽可能地使全国工农干部的文化程度能在若干年内提高到相当于中学的水平。
    二、工农速成中学修业年限暂定为三年，必要时得延长之，其课程相当于普通中学的基本课程。工农干部文化补习学校修业年限暂定为二年，必要时得延长之，其课程相当于完全小学的基本课程。这两种学校的课程内容均须力求精简，使切合国家建设的需要及工农干部的特点。
    三、工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的学生，应由各机关、工厂、学校有计划地抽调或选送。入工农速成中学的条件为：参加革命工作三年以上的工农干部或有三年以上工龄的产业工人，具有相当于高级小学毕业的文化程度，年在十八至三十五岁，身体健康者。入工农干部文化补习学校的条件为：参加革命工作三年以上的工农干部；年在十八岁以上者。各单位于选调学员时，须认识工农干部对文化的迫切需要和国家建设的长远利益，按照规定选送，不得敷衍充数。
    四、工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校，均须配备优良的教职员担任教学和校务，并供给必要的设备。
    五、为了奖励优秀的工农干部及产业工人入学，凡对离职学习的学生，在学习期间，其原有的军龄、工龄应继续计算。供给制干部入学后，其政治和物质生活等待遇必须保持其原来标准。工资制干部按其相当等级受供给制待遇。工人按一般供给制待遇。学生入学后其家属生活确有困难者，得酌情予以补助。工农速成中学及工农干部文化补习学校教员的工资，应稍高于当地普通中学及小学教员的待遇。
    六、工农速成中学，暂由中央人民政府教育部及各大行政区教育部统筹举办。工农干部文化补习学校，可由各高级机关及省市县人民政府分别举办。
    七、中央人民政府教育部应根据上述各项原则，制定工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的实施办法，公布实行，并有计划地训练师资，编订教材，以应两种学校的需要。全国工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的学制、课程、教材和教学计划，均应遵照中央人民政府教育部的规定办理。
