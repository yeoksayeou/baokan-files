    Supporting General Wu Xiuquan's Speech Condemning American Imperialist Aggression

    General Wu Xiuquan, the representative of our country, in his speech at the United Nations Security Council, completely represented the common will of the Chinese people, and announced to the people of the world all the aggressive crimes of the bloody American imperialism. All the conspiracies and tricks of the warmongers have been exposed. In this righteous and stern accusation, General Wu Xiuquan put forward the just demands of all the Chinese people, and it can also be said, of all peace-loving people in the world. However, the American imperialists dared to obliterate this just demand, and instigated their vassal states to openly deny this solemn proposal by means of their so-called majority vote. This arrogant behavior completely exposed the ferocious face of the American imperialists in expanding their war of aggression. We express infinite indignation at this illegal resolution, and we must solemnly warn the American imperialists and all their vassal states that you should bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by this illegal act.
    We firmly believe that what Representative Wu Xiuquan said, "The era in which imperialism is allowed to invade and the people are not allowed to resist has passed. The Chinese people have full confidence in defeating all imperialists who dare to invade China."

    拥护伍修权将军控诉美帝侵略的发言
    我国代表伍修权将军在联合国安全理事会上的发言，完全代表了中国人民的共同意志，向全世界人民宣布了血腥的美国帝国主义的一切侵略罪行。战争贩子们的一切阴谋诡计都揭破了。在这义正词严的控诉里，伍修权将军提出了全中国人民、也可以说就是全世界爱好和平人民的正义建议。然而美帝国主义者竟敢抹煞这种正大的要求，唆使其附庸国，以其所谓多数表决方式，公然否决了这一严正的提案。这样狂妄的行为，完全暴露出美帝扩大侵略战争的凶恶面目。我们对这一非法决议，表示无限的愤恨，并要正告美帝和附和他的一切附庸国，你们对这一非法行为所招致的一切后果，应负完全责任。
    我们深信，伍修权代表所说的话“只准帝国主义侵略，不准人民反抗的时代已经过去了。中国人民完全有信心打退敢于侵略中国的一切帝国主义者。”
