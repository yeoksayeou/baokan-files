    In the Great Theme
       About the Poems on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
       Feng Zhi
    In November alone, the editorial department of a certain publication received approximately nine hundred poems submitted. Almost all of these poems sing of a great theme: "Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending the Country." This historically significant movement has stirred up a huge wave in the field of contemporary poetry, which is inevitable and natural. From this, we can surmise how immense the total number of poems with the theme of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" received by newspaper and magazine editorial departments across the country must be. This phenomenon illustrates the broad mobilization of poetry workers. We welcome this phenomenon, we praise this phenomenon.
    From these poems, we see that the authors have a common direction: they explicitly state what they support, what they oppose, what they love, and what they hate; in other words, they express the will of the people in the form of poetry. What greater task does a poetry worker have than to express the will of the people? Therefore, every time we receive a poem, we feel how the author's heart is connected to the pulse of the times; regardless of how the poem is written, as long as we think of the author's state of mind and attitude when writing it, we feel a sense of excitement and encouragement.
    However, at the beginning of the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, most of the poems were often too simple, too abstract, and too general. The authors had correct understandings to varying degrees, but they were unable to connect them to actual life, so the poems inevitably became empty, merely copying study documents or a brief history of American aggression against China, simply repeating phrases like "The flames of American imperialist aggression have spread to the borders of the motherland," "We can no longer tolerate it, we can no longer sit idly by," "Korea is our brotherly country, when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold, when the house is broken, the hall is endangered," "American imperialism, you are a paper tiger, strong in appearance but weak in reality"... These ready-made or similar phrases created a monotonous phenomenon. Although these poems could make people think of the author's political sensitivity and enthusiasm, due to the generalization of the content and the repeated use of ready-made phrases, their power to move people was very weak, making people feel that the quantity was indeed large, but the content was too poor. Quantity is certainly better the more there is; but the content must also be enriched and solidified.
    This point has been felt not only by readers but also by many authors. As the movement unfolded vigorously, the things that touched the authors gradually increased and became more complex. The poetry authors, like soldiers, dispersed from the general team, each searching for their stronghold for combat: thus, there were those who exposed the dark side of American society, those who narrated the brutality of American aggressors, those who wrote heroic stories of the Korean People's Army and the frustrated emotions of American soldiers, those who elaborated on the significance of protecting the country and resisting America and aiding Korea, some who depicted the mountains and rivers of Korea, and some who pointed out the inevitable end of American imperialism... These were indeed strongholds conducive to combat, but the poetry warriors did not build these strongholds firmly enough. The scope was broadened, the themes were enriched, and the monotonous phenomenon should have been overcome. But it was not. From most of the poems I have seen, the exposure of darkness was often limited to some superficial observations; the narration of the enemy's brutal acts was usually done using words like burning, killing, and raping; the heroic stories of the People's Army and the frustrated emotions of American soldiers were mostly copied verbatim from newspaper reports; the elaboration of the significance of protecting the country was reduced to abstract slogans; the mountains and rivers of Korea were nothing more than the Yalu River, Mount Paektu, Pyongyang, and Seoul, a few geographical names; the end of American imperialism was just like the end of Hitler and Mussolini—you said it this way, and I said it that way, and the way of expression was still inevitably the same. Writing poetry in a way that simply repeats what others say is laziness on the part of the author and irresponsibility to the reader. Because such poems are difficult to move the reader—if a poem cannot move the reader, what is the meaning of its existence?
    But this is not to ask authors to be unconventional and play with techniques. In this great movement, there is nothing strange to show off and no techniques to play with, just as "fancy tricks" cannot be used on a real battlefield. We only ask that poetry authors, in addition to political understanding, can further experience the real feeling of combat from life. A great movement is never empty; its greatness is because it can have an effect and influence on every small thing: the greatness of sunlight can be reflected by the growth of a small tree; the greatness of Chairman Mao can be reflected by the smiling face of a liberated peasant. The great significance of resisting America and aiding Korea is closely related to the lives of each of us: workers are working hard to produce, and the American imperialists want to sabotage their newly established plans; peasants have been allocated land, and the Americans want to burn down the villages they have just built; children have just obtained the happiness of receiving education and care, and the American robbers want to steal this happiness: how heartbreaking this is! Which of these things is not related to our lives? Think back to how much suffering imperialism has brought to the Chinese people in the past, how the Korean people once fought side by side with us against Japanese aggressors: which of these things is not related to our lives? We are giving the American robbers a head-on blow and a bloody lesson in order to protect our homes and defend our country and to help a friendly country: which bullet fired on the battlefield is not related to our lives? Therefore, the real feeling of combat is not only felt by the soldiers at the front, but by everyone who lives honestly. The talent of poetry workers lies in being able to deeply experience this real life, to generalize and refine it, and to express their own and the masses' real feelings of combat in a melting pot, but they must not only speak of theoretical understanding without actual emotion, making people feel that the author has only made the effort to "adapt" other people's articles into poetry.
    Once you have the real feeling of combat, you must further temper this real feeling and turn it into powerful verses. Don't casually pick up a ready-made phrase and gloss over it, reducing the weight of the precious real feeling in front of the reader. Verses are our weapons, and of course we want to sharpen them as much as possible. For the sake of victory in battle, we must never arbitrarily pick up a weapon that is not suitable for our equipment or use blunt knives and guns used by others for combat because we are afraid of trouble. Slogans have their own great power, but if it is a poem that simply uses ready-made slogans and lacks appropriate arrangement, then the powerful slogans in the poem will lose their power. Newspapers have published many news stories and photos about the enemy's brutal acts, and have also narrated many heroic stories of the Korean people. We feel resentment towards the former and excitement towards the latter. If we want to write these deeds into poems so that others can also feel our resentment and excitement, then we must put more effort into the organization and expression of the poems. Otherwise, what is written in the form of poetry is often not as natural and lively as the original report.
    Originally, this is a very common principle: without an abstract understanding and without a real feeling of combat in life, one cannot pick up a pen to write poetry at all; with a real feeling but without powerful verses, the poem will naturally reduce its effect or even fail.
    General poems are needed, but we hope that they can be felt and grasped through specific images. Poems from all aspects and angles are needed, but we hope that they are not repetitions of reports and papers. Only through the form of poetry can we better mobilize the emotions of readers and enhance their love and hate.
    Our voices are different from each other, but we have a common will. Our poems express a common will, but we must use our different voices.

    在伟大的主题下
       关于抗美援朝的诗歌
       冯至
    仅仅在十一月份，某刊编辑部就收到投稿来的诗约九百来篇。这些诗几乎全部都歌咏着一个伟大的主题：“抗美援朝，保家卫国”。这具有历史意义的运动在现在诗歌的领域里掀起巨大的浪潮，是必然的，当然的。由此我们可以推想，国内各地报纸和杂志的编辑部所收到的以“抗美援朝”为主题的诗歌的总数，将是何等庞大。这个现象说明了诗歌工作者的广泛动员。我们欢迎这个现象，我们赞美这个现象。
    从这些诗里我们看到，作者的面前有一个共同的方向：他们明确地说出他们拥护什么，反对什么，爱什么，恨什么；换句话说，他们用诗的形式述说了人民的意志。一个诗歌工作者，除了表达人民的意志，还有什么更大的任务呢？所以，我们每逢接到一首诗，都会感到作者的心是怎样联系着时代的脉搏；不管诗写得怎样，我们只要一想到作者执笔时的心情和态度，便会感到一种兴奋，一种鼓舞。
    但是在抗美援朝运动起始展开时，大部分的诗往往是太简单，太抽象，太一般了。作者有或深或浅的正确的认识，却没有能够联系到实际的生活，所以写出来的诗，就不免失之空洞，在诗里只抄写了学习的文件或美国侵华略史，简单地反复使用着“美帝侵略的火焰，已经蔓延到祖国的边疆”，“我们不能再容忍，我们不能再坐视”，“朝鲜是我们兄弟之邦，唇亡齿寒，户破堂危”，“美帝，你是外强中干的纸老虎”………那些现成的或与之相类似的词句，形成千篇一律的现象。这些诗虽然能使人想到作者政治上的感应与热情，但由于内容的一般化与现成词句的反复使用，致使它们感人的力量很薄弱，让人觉得数量诚然不少，内容却太贫乏了。数，当然越多越好；可是内容，也要充实坚固起来。
    这一点，不只是读者，许多作者也感到了。随着这个运动如火如荼的展开，打动作者的事物渐渐多了，渐渐复杂了，诗作者也像是战士一般，从总队里散开，各自寻找他作战的据点：于是有揭露美国社会黑暗的，有叙述美国侵略者的残暴的，有写朝鲜人民军英勇的故事与美国士兵沮丧的情绪的，有阐发保家卫国与抗美援朝的意义的，有的描画了朝鲜的山川景色，有的指明美帝国主义必然的末路……这诚然都是些利于作战的据点，但诗歌的战士们却不曾把这些据点布置得十分巩固。方面广了，题材丰富了，千篇一律的现象本来应该克服了。可是并没有。从我看到的大多数的诗稿里看来，揭露黑暗，往往只限于一些表面的见闻；叙述敌人残暴的行为，则惯于运用烧、杀、奸淫一类的字眼；人民军英勇的故事与美国兵沮丧的情绪多半从报纸的报道上平铺直叙地抄录下来；阐发保家卫国的意义，则流于抽象的标语口号；朝鲜的山川景色不外乎鸭绿江，白头山，平壤，汉城几个地理上的名称；美帝国主义的末路就是希特勒，墨索里尼的末路——你这样说，我也这样说，表现的方式仍不免于雷同。诗写得人云亦云，在作者是一种躲懒，对于读者是不负责任。因为这样的诗很难感动读者——不能感动读者，一首诗的存在还有什么意义呢？
    但这并不是要求作者标奇立异，玩弄技巧。在这伟大的运动中根本没有什么奇异可标，技巧可弄，正如在真实的战场上“花枪”是耍不起来的。我们只要求诗歌的作者除却政治的认识外，能够再深一层从生活中体验到战斗的实感。一个伟大的运动绝不是空洞的，它之所以伟大是因为它能够在每一个微小的事物上都发生作用和影响：日光的伟大，一棵小树的生长可以反映出来；毛主席的伟大，一个翻身农民的笑脸可以反映出来。抗美援朝的伟大意义则与我们每一个人的生活都有密切的关联：工人正在努力生产，美帝要求破坏他们刚刚定好的计划；农民分得土地，美国要求焚烧他们刚刚建设起来的农村；小孩子刚刚得到受教育受保育的幸福，美国强盗要来抢走这个幸福：这是多么使人痛心的事！这一切哪一件不与我们的生活有关？回想一下过去帝国主义给中国人民多少苦难，朝鲜的人民曾经怎样和我们并肩作战反抗日本侵略者：这一切哪一件不与我们的生活有关？我们为了保家卫国，为了援助友邦，给美国强盗一个迎头的打击，一个血的教训：战场上哪一颗放出去的子弹不与我们的生活有关系？所以战斗的实感，并不是只有前方战士才能有，而是每一个正直地生活着的人们都会感到的。诗歌工作者的才能就在于能够深入体验这种现实生活，加以概括和提炼，把自己的和群众的战斗的实感熔合着表达出来，却不可只说出理论上的认识，没有实际的感情，使人觉得作者只作了把别人的文章“改编”为诗歌的努力。
    有战斗的实感了，还要进一步锻炼这个实感，使它成为有力的诗句，不要随便检起来一句现成的话便敷衍了事，使宝贵的实感在读者面前减轻了分量。诗句是我们的武器，我们当然要把它磨炼得越锐利越好，为了战斗的胜利，我们绝不能因怕费事而任意拿起一件与我们的配备不相宜的兵器或是旁人用钝了的刀枪去作战。标语口号自有它们伟大的力量，但假使是一首诗，只是袭用现成的标语口号，又缺乏适当的安排，那么在这首诗里有力的标语口号反倒会丧失它的力量。报纸上给我们登载了不少关于敌人残暴行为的消息和照片，同时也述说了许多朝鲜人民英勇的故事，我们对于前者感到忿恨，对于后者感到兴奋，我们若是要把这些事迹写成诗，让别人也感到我们的忿恨与兴奋，则须在诗的组织与表现方法上多下一点功夫，否则往往用诗的形式写出来的还不如原来的报告自然而活泼动人。
    本来，这是一个很普通的道理：只有抽象的认识而没有生活上战斗的实感，根本就不能提起笔来写诗；有了实感而没有有力的诗句，这首诗自然会减少作用，甚至失败。
    一般性的诗是需要的，可是我们希望它能够通过各别的具体形象使人能感得到，捉得到。各方面各角度的诗是需要的，可是我们希望它们不是报道与论文的复述。只有通过诗的形式才更能鼓动读者的情感，增强他们的爱与恨。
    我们说话的声音彼此不相同，我们却有一个共同的意志。我们的诗在表达一个共同的意志，我们却要用我们彼此不相同的声音。
