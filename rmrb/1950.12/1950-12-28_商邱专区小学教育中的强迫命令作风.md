To the Editor:

    Coercive commandism exists in primary education in Shangqiu District, Henan Province. For example, corporal punishment or disguised corporal punishment is very common in primary schools throughout the area. In the Second Complete Primary School of Shangqiu, children are told to set their own rules, and whoever makes a mistake must slap themselves in the face. In the Liu Kou Complete Primary School of Shangqiu, children who make mistakes are told to "draw a circle on the ground as a prison" and stand in the "prison" in the sun. The Second and Third Complete Primary Schools of Zhuji adopt a "rotation system" for naughty children. Many primary schools also ask children who make mistakes to do hard labor. What is especially serious is that some primary schools even use methods such as suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies to solve children's ideological problems. For example, the Eighth Complete Primary School of Yucheng County uses "mass sanctions and spiritual suppression" to deal with backward students. The Second Complete Primary School of Yucheng County uses the method of "punishing the ringleader, ignoring the followers, and rewarding meritorious service" to deal with children who make mistakes. The Fourth Complete Primary School of Zhuji asks naughty children to sign their names to find guarantors, supervise each other, and guarantee to study well.

    In addition, some primary schools use feudal methods to replace persuasive education. For example, the Third Complete Primary School of Zhuji asks children to "make friends" and "become sworn brothers," addressing each other as elder and younger brothers, and swearing not to make mistakes. The Duji Complete Primary School of Shangqiu divides children into groups, and the group leader sits behind the group during class to supervise them.

    All the above methods are extremely wrong. They greatly damage the normal physical and mental development of children. The main reason for their emergence is that the cultural and educational departments of various counties do not provide enough leadership for primary education, and some teachers have too low a political level and lack good study and research on new democratic education. In response, the current Special Commissioner's Office has issued a circular to the cultural and educational sections of various counties, complete primary schools, and elementary primary schools to quickly correct these problems. I believe that similar phenomena may also exist in other regions, so I hope to publish this letter to draw the attention of cultural and educational departments in various regions.

### 商邱专区小学教育中的强迫命令作风

    商邱专区小学教育中的强迫命令作风编辑同志：
    河南商邱专区小学教育中存在着强迫命令的作风。如体罚或变相体罚的现象，在各地小学中非常普遍。商邱二完小叫儿童自定规约，谁犯了错误，自己打自己耳光。商邱刘口完小叫犯错误的儿童“画地为牢”，站在“牢”内晒太阳。朱集二、三完小对调皮儿童采“轮训制度”。还有不少小学，叫犯错误的儿童做苦工。尤其严重的是，有的小学竟以和剿匪反霸等的方式，来解决儿童的思想问题。例如虞城八完小，对待落后同学采用“群众制裁，精神镇压”的办法。虞城二完小，对待犯错误儿童采用“首恶必办，胁从不问，立功受奖”的办法。朱集四完小，叫调皮儿童实行签名找保人，互相监督，保证学好。
    此外，还有的小学则采用封建的办法，来代替说服教育工作。例如，朱集三完小叫儿童“结朋友”“拜把子”，互相称兄道弟，宣誓不犯错误。商邱杜集完小，把儿童编成小组，上课时叫小组长坐在小组后面，实行监视。
    所有上述的办法，都是极端错误的。它们都大大地损害了儿童身心的正常发展。其产生的原因，主要是由于各县文教部门对小学教育领导不够，部分教员政治水平过低，对新民主主义教育缺乏很好的学习和研究。对此，现该专署已通令各县文教科、完小、初小迅速纠正。我以为类似现象各地亦可能存在，故希将此信刊出，以引起各地文教部门的注意。  胡扬、元丽
