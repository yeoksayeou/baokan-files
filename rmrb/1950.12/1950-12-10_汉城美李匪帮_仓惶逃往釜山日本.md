Xinhua News Agency, December 9th—Under the deterrent of the victorious counter-offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the American and Syngman Rhee gangs occupying Seoul are panicking and continuing to flee to Busan and Japan. According to a United Press reporter, because the "United Nations forces" on the western front being pursued and annihilated are fleeing south, the American and Syngman Rhee gangs fear that "Seoul will fall into the hands of the communists within two weeks." Therefore, "the evacuation of Seoul has reached its climax." The United Press reporter wrote helplessly: When Syngman Rhee's "prominent officials" "asked the Americans whether the United Nations forces would defend Seoul," "no one could answer them."

Twenty members of the secretariat of the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea," an instrument of American aggression, have fled to Japan in a hurry. The American "Embassy" in Seoul and the office of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, which carries out economic aggression against Korea, are both "piled high with boxes printed with the words 'To Busan'," preparing to flee. More than half of the staff of the ECA have fled Seoul. The head of the ECA, Lawren, lamented that the US plan to economically enslave the Korean people had been shattered, and sadly said that the US plan "is inevitably going to be delayed."

The Syngman Rhee puppet government has purchased three transport planes in preparation for fleeing Seoul. Syngman Rhee's puppet Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo, revealed in an "emergency secret meeting" of the puppet National Assembly on the 7th that the Syngman Rhee puppet government and the puppet "parliament" were preparing to flee to Busan. He said: "When the Communist army crosses the 38th parallel, the parliament and the government will immediately move to Busan." Shin Sung-mo also notified the puppet National Assembly members and important civil servants to send their families to the southern coast.

The American and Syngman Rhee gangs preparing to flee are discarding "heavy furniture that cannot be taken away" and are busy collecting valuables that can be taken away. Furniture is filling the market in Seoul, and prices have fallen by 90% compared to last week. The price of a large piano is only half the price of an ordinary old watch. However, as gold and US dollars are being shipped out to South Korea and Japan, the price of gold and US dollars doubled in one day on the 5th. Jewelry prices have also doubled compared to last week. Due to the scramble to flee by the American and Syngman Rhee gangs, the price of truck tickets from Seoul to Busan has soared repeatedly, from 15 US dollars all the way up to 350 US dollars.

    汉城美李匪帮
    仓惶逃往釜山日本
    【新华社九日讯】在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军胜利反攻的震慑下，占踞汉城的美、李匪帮惊慌不安，正继续仓惶逃往釜山和日本。据合众社记者称：由于被追歼的西线的“联合国部队”正在向南逃跑，美李匪帮恐惧“汉城将在两周内陷于共产党手中”。因此，“汉城的撤退已达高潮”。合众社记者无可奈何地写道：当李承晚的“显要官员”“问美国人联合国军队是否将保卫汉城”时，“没有人能答复他们”。
    作为美国侵略工具的所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”秘书处的人员二十人，已经慌忙逃往日本。汉城的美国“大使馆”和对朝鲜进行经济侵略的美国经合分署的办公处，都“高高堆着印有‘运往釜山’字样的箱子”，准备逃跑。经合分署已有半数以上的工作人员逃出汉城。该分署署长罗伦鉴于美国经济奴役朝鲜人民的计划已被打破，悲哀地说：美国的计划“是不可避免地要延搁了”。
    李承晚傀儡政府已购买了三架运输机，准备作逃离汉城之用。伪国防部长申性模七日在伪国民议会的“紧急秘密会议”中透露李承晚傀儡政府及伪“议会”准备逃往釜山。他说：“在共产党军越过三八线时，议会和政府将立即迁到釜山。”申性模并通知伪国会议员和重要文官人员把他们的家属送往南海岸。
    准备逃跑的美、李匪帮，正丢下“不能带走的”粗重家具，而大事搜罗能够带走的细软。家具正充塞着汉城的市场，价格比上周跌了百分之九十，一架大钢琴的定价只合普通旧手表一半的价格。但是，由于黄金美钞纷纷向南朝鲜与日本外运，黄金美钞在五日一天内上涨了一倍。珠宝价格也比上周涨了一倍。由于美、李匪帮争相逃跑，从汉城开往釜山的卡车票价，一再狂涨，从十五美元一直涨到三百五十美元。
