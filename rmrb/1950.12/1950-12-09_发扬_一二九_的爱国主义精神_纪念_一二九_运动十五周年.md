    Promote the Patriotic Spirit of the "December 9th" Movement
    Commemorating the 15th Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement
    In 1935, He Yingqin, the representative of the reactionary traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government, signed the humiliating He-Umezu Agreement with the Japanese invaders in North China. Following this, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was established. A group of traitors, spies, and hooligans, instigated by the Japanese invaders, feigned public opinion and demanded autonomy and independence for North China. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek then advocated "good neighborliness" and "friendship," prohibiting all anti-Japanese activities. Under the Kuomintang's reactionary measures of "anti-Japanese activities are a crime," the people of the whole country were filled with righteous indignation at the Japanese invaders' escalating aggression.
    On December 9th, students in Peiping (Beijing) took the lead in rising up, holding a large-scale demonstration. Disregarding the Kuomintang bandit gang's special agents' and police's tyrannical persecution, and the attacks with broadswords and water cannons, the students shouted loud slogans to the people of the whole country: "Stop the civil war, unite against foreign aggression," "Abolish the traitorous agreements," "Down with Japanese imperialism," calling on the people of the whole country to rise up and save the national crisis.
    Fifteen years ago, the "December 9th" Movement, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, set off a high tide in the Chinese people's anti-Japanese national salvation movement, mobilized and educated a large number of patriotic youth, who bravely participated in the armed struggle against Japan, and played a significant role in developing guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines and establishing anti-Japanese base areas. Until the victory of the War of Resistance, due to the Kuomintang reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, under the instigation and assistance of American imperialism, launching a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas, students across the country inherited the traditional spirit of "December 9th," and continuously carried out heroic demonstrations and marches against persecution, against civil war, against hunger, and against American support for Japan in 1945, 1947, and 1948. They played a certain role in the entire cause of the Chinese people's liberation.
    Today, in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, the young students of the whole country are again bravely standing at the forefront of this movement. (Attached pictures)

    The December 9th demonstration went to Xinhua Gate to petition, and the students were brutally beaten by the reactionary authorities' military police.
    On May 20, 1947, students in Peiping, continuing the traditional spirit of "December 9th," held a large demonstration against civil war and hunger.
    On June 9, 1948, students in Peiping held a large demonstration against American imperialism's support for Japan.
    On the 1st of this month, after the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council issued a joint decision on recruiting young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools, students in Beijing schools promoted the traditional patriotic spirit and enthusiastically responded to this call. The picture shows Peking University students signing their names.
    The December 9th demonstration was dispersed by the reactionary traitorous authorities in Peiping, headed by He Yingqin, with broadswords and water cannons. The heroic students fought with the military police to seize the water cannons.
    On December 9, 1935, the reactionary authorities in Peiping sent a large number of military police to various schools to search for and arrest students.
    On April 9, 1948, students from various colleges and universities in Peiping protested against the atrocities of secret agents at the Normal University and held a petition against persecution. The picture shows the demonstration in front of the "Xingyuan" (Provisional Presidential Palace).
    On July 9, 1948, students from Northeast and North China jointly protested the "July 5th Massacre" and held a major petition against suppression and for the right to live.

    发扬“一二九”的爱国主义精神
    纪念“一二九”运动十五周年
    一九三五年，反动卖国的蒋介石政府的代表何应钦在华北和日寇订立了丧权辱国的何梅协定，接着成立了冀察政委会，一群汉奸、特务、流氓在日寇唆使下，假借民意，要求华北自治独立。卖国贼蒋介石就高唱“睦邻”，“亲善”，禁止一切抗日活动。在国民党“抗日有罪”的反动措施下，全国人民对于日寇得寸进尺的侵略罪行，无不义愤填膺。
    十二月九日，北平学生首先振臂奋起，举行大规模的示威运动，同学们不顾国民党匪帮特务、警察的横暴迫害，和大刀、水龙的袭击，向全国人民喊出：“停止内战，一致对外”“撤销卖国协定”“打倒日本帝国主义”等响亮口号，号召全国人民起来挽救民族危机。
    十五年前的“一二、九”运动，在中国共产党领导下，掀起了中国人民抗日救国运动的高潮，发动和教育了广大爱国青年，英勇地参加抗日的武装斗争，在发展敌后游击战争和建立抗日根据地的工作中，起了重大作用。直至抗战胜利，由于国民党反动政府蒋介石在美帝国主义的策动和援助下，全面向解放区进攻，全国学生继承了“一二、九”的传统精神，于一九四五、四七、四八三年中，连续不断地进行了反迫害、反内战、反饥饿、反美扶日等英勇的示威游行。在整个中国人民的解放事业中，起了一定的作用。
    今天，在抗美援朝的运动中，全国的青年学生又英勇地站在这一运动的前列。（附图片）
