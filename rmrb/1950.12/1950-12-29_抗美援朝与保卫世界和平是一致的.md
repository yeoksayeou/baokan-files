    The American imperialists wage aggressive war, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and destroy world peace. Their army, navy, and air force indiscriminately bomb and destroy peaceful cities, slaughtering innocent old people, young children, women, and infants, which is a criminal act against humanity that disregards human morality. The flames of war will spread throughout the world. In order to defend world peace, the Chinese people, witnessing the bestial massacre and destruction of the people and property of neighboring countries, which has already spread to the doorstep of our own country, have risen up to organize volunteer armies and launch the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. This is the highest moral manifestation of the people of the East, and also the highest moral manifestation of the people of the whole world. Peace is just. If a robber enters a neighbor's house and arbitrarily kills the owner, arbitrarily looting and destroying property, and gradually encroaching on the house next door, the friend living next door not only has the moral responsibility to help the neighbor jointly expel the robber, but also must capture and punish the robber for his own safety. If the friend next door does not help to expel the robber, the robber may come to the friend's house, and may also come to other people's houses, and a world war will break out.
    Resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country means opposing aggression and stopping the destruction of peace. To defend world peace, we must take action to oppose aggression. Therefore, resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country is inseparable from defending world peace, and is completely consistent.

    抗美援朝与保卫世界和平是一致的
    盛丕华
    美帝国主义侵略战争，干涉他国内政，破坏世界和平。其海陆空军滥肆轰炸，毁灭和平城市，屠杀无辜老少妇孺，是不顾人道对人类的一种罪犯行动。战火将延烧全世界，我中国人民为了保卫世界和平，目睹邻邦的人民和财产遭到了兽性的屠杀和毁灭，且已烧到自己国家门口；因此全国人民起来组织志愿军，发起抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，这是东方人民最崇高的道德表现，也是全世界人民最崇高的道德表现。和平是正义的，强盗走进邻居把主人任意杀戮，把财产任意抢劫和毁灭，渐渐要侵入到贴邻的人家；住在贴邻的朋友，不但道义上有帮助邻居共同驱逐强盗的责任，而且为了自己安全也必须把强盗捉住加以惩处。假使贴邻朋友不去帮助驱逐，这强盗可能是要走到贴邻朋友家里来的，还可能要到其他人家来，这样世界大战就会起来了。
    抗美援朝保家卫国，即是为了反对侵略，制止破坏和平，要保卫世界和平，必须用行动来反对侵略，因此抗美援朝保家卫国与保卫世界和平是分不开的一件事，是完全一致的。
