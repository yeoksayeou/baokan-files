List of Middle School Students Participating in Military Cadre Schools Announced

[This newspaper dispatch] (Our newspaper) The list of Beijing middle school students participating in military cadre schools was announced in each school on the 27th. Every name that was approved caused cheers and applause from teachers and students in each school. At Hebei High School, Hebei Provincial Teachers College, No. 3 Middle School, Girls' No. 5 Middle School, Yu Ying and other schools, the students participating in military cadre schools were paraded in the streets to the sound of gongs, drums, and firecrackers, and thrown into the air. They were covered head to toe in colorful silk, paper flowers, and badges of honor; everywhere there were enthusiastic handshakes and hugs. The president of the Hui Nationality College believed that this was not only the glory of the students who were approved, but also the glory of the entire Hui nationality. No. 1 Middle School, No. 7 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, Finance and Economics School, Huiwen and other schools have already started holding celebration meetings or farewell parties by class. The young students of Xiehe Girls' Middle School kept giving candy and apples to the older sisters who were participating in military cadre schools, so excited that they couldn't say anything. The students from Hebei High School who were participating in military cadre schools were all moved to a specially set up "Glory Hall" to live in that day.

The students who were approved to participate in military cadre schools were treated with glory, but they were not proud. Su Guanru, a student from Beijing Normal University, said, "It's not really glorious for me to wear a red flower now. It will only be truly glorious when I make meritorious service in battle and wear a badge of honor then." Lv Youlan, a student from the Fourth Department of the Normal University Affiliated Middle School, expressed that after going to military cadre school, she would strive to be a model student in learning and a combat hero in battle. The students who were not approved have signed up to participate in military medical schools, logistics schools, and to join the army, navy, and air force schools to study away from the school, so that they can cooperate in combat in the future.

The long-awaited farewell party will be held successively in various schools.

    中等学校参加军事干校学生名单宣布
    【本报讯】京市中等学校参加军事干部学校学生名单，已于二十七日在各校宣布。每一个被录取的名字，都引起各校师生一片欢呼和掌声。河北高中、河北省师、三中、女五中，育英等校，在锣鼓、鞭炮声中，参加军事干校的学生，被抬起来游行，被抛到空中。满头、满身是彩绸、花纸和光荣花；到处是热情的握手和拥抱。回民学院院长认为：这不仅是被批准学生的光荣，也是整个回族的光荣。一中、七中、八中、财经、汇文等校已分班开祝贺会或欢送会。协化女中的小同学，在会上一个劲地往参加军事干校的大姐嘴中送糖、送苹果，兴奋得什么话也说不出来。河北高中参加军事干校的学生，当天都被搬到特设的“光荣斋”里去住。
    被批准参加军事干校的学生，受到光荣的对待，并不骄傲。北师学生苏冠儒说：“我现在戴上红花，还不算光荣，将来在战斗中立了功，那时戴上光荣花才算真正的光荣。”师大附中四部学生吕友兰表示到军事干校后，要在学习中争取当学习模范，在战斗中争取当战斗英雄。没有被批准的学生，则纷纷要报名参加军医、后勤等校，和参加陆、海、空军学校学生一起离校学习，将来配合作战。
    筹备已久的欢送会，将在各校陆续举行。
