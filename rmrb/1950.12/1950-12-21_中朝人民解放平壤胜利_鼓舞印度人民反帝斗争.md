Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 20th: The great victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in defeating the American invading forces and liberating Pyongyang has made the Indian people see more clearly that American imperialism is just a paper tiger, thus greatly enhancing their confidence in defending world peace. Newspapers across India prominently published the news of the comprehensive collapse of the American invading forces on the Korean battlefield in early December. Even conservative newspapers admitted that the failure of the American imperialists was irreversible. The Calcutta Stock Exchange Gazette wrote in an editorial on the 5th, "The tragic defeat of the United Nations forces in Korea came so suddenly that qualified observers say there are few similar examples in military history." The Bombay Free Press sarcastically said, "General MacArthur's hope of ending the war in a few days has completely turned into a fairy tale fantasy." The New Delhi News Chronicle wrote, "MacArthur has failed strategically. As his troops advanced towards the northeastern border, he did not understand the serious and strong reaction this action caused on the Chinese side." The Indian Times wrote in an editorial on the 4th that the Chinese people's "military success" fully demonstrated that the new China "has the ability to defend its own interests."

The great victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has greatly inspired the Indian people's struggle to defend peace. The Indian people have launched a nationwide movement to protest Truman's belligerent statement on November 30th, made as a result of the failure of the invasion of Korea . The Preparatory Committee of the Second All-India Peace Congress issued a statement calling for mass meetings and demonstrations, and launching a peace signature campaign. Mirajkar, vice chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress, issued a statement "demanding the withdrawal of American troops under the banner of the United Nations, and immediately letting the Korean people solve their own problems according to their own wishes." The All-India Student Federation sent a telegram to Indian Prime Minister Nehru, requesting the withdrawal of foreign troops in Korea and resolving the Korean issue peacefully; and called on all Indian students and youth to oppose Truman's threatening statement and launch a peace signature campaign. The Delhi Democratic Youth League recently received a petition signed by 300 young people, expressing their willingness to go to Korea to participate in the Korean people's struggle against American invaders.

The Indian people expressed their admiration for the just action of the Chinese People's Volunteers in assisting Korea, and therefore urgently demanded to understand and learn from the new China. The literary and artistic works of the new China are warmly welcomed in India. The 25th Annual Meeting of the All-India Philosophical Society and the Centennial Anniversary of the All-India Geological Society, held in Calcutta this month, as well as the All-India Medical Students Conference held in Madras, all requested the holding of Chinese cultural exhibitions. Delhi University hosted a Chinese cultural evening, at which Chinese films were shown. Dr. Sun, the vice-chancellor of the university, emphasized the importance of Sino-Indian cultural exchanges in his opening remarks. An overseas Chinese in Calcutta was riding a tram earlier this month when an Indian ticket seller pointed to the news about China in the newspaper and said to him, "China is our hope."

    中朝人民解放平壤胜利  鼓舞印度人民反帝斗争
    【新华社新德里二十日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军击溃美国侵略军与解放平壤的伟大胜利，使印度人民更清楚地看穿美帝国主义是只纸老虎，从而大大地增强了他们保卫世界和平的信心。印度全国各地报纸十二月初都以显著地位刊载美国侵略军在朝鲜战场全面溃退的消息。即使保守的报纸也承认美帝国主义者的失败是无法挽救的。加尔各答仙酒市场报五日在社论中写道：“联合国军队在朝鲜的悲惨失败是来得这样突然，据有资格的观察家说，在军事史上也很少有这种类似的例子。”孟买自由日报讽刺地说：“麦克阿瑟将军在几天之内结束战争的希望，完全变成了童话式的幻想。”新德里新闻纪事报写道：“麦克阿瑟在战略上失败了。在他的部队向东北边境推进时，他并不了解这种行动在中国方面所引起的严重的强烈的反应。”印度时报四日在社论中说：中国人民“在军事上的成功”，充分说明了新中国“有能力保卫她自己的利益”。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利，极大地鼓舞了印度人民保卫和平的斗争。印度人民在全国范围内，展开了抗议杜鲁门由于侵朝失败而于十一月三十日发表的好战声明的运动。第二届全印和平大会筹备委员会曾发表声明，号召举行群众大会和示威，并开展和平签名运动。全印总工会副主席米拉吉凯尔发表声明，“要求撤退在联合国旗帜掩护下的美国军队，立即让朝鲜人民按照自己的愿望解决自己的问题”。全印学生联合会曾致电印度总理尼赫鲁，要求撤退在朝鲜的外国军队，用和平方式解决朝鲜问题；并号召全印学生、青年反对杜鲁门的威胁声明，展开和平签名运动。德里民主青年联盟最近接到三百个青年签名的请求书，表示志愿到朝鲜去，参加朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者的斗争。
    印度人民对中国人民志愿援朝的正义行动表示钦佩，因而迫切要求了解和学习新中国。新中国的文学艺术作品在印度受到热烈的欢迎。本月在加尔各答举行的全印哲学学会二十五周年年会和全印地质学会一百周年年会、以及在马德拉斯举行的全印医科学生大会，都要求举办中国文化展览会。德里大学主办了一个中国文化晚会，会上放映了中国电影。该校副校长孙博士致开幕词时，曾强调中、印文化交流的重要性。加尔各答一个华侨本月初在乘电车的时候，一个印度售票员指着报纸上有关中国的消息对他说：“中国就是我们的希望。”
