The year 1950 is drawing to a close, and the annual final accounts must be compiled and submitted on schedule. To facilitate the organization and preparation, the following principles are hereby stipulated for the year-end clearance of fiscal revenue and expenditure for 1950, which are to be strictly observed and implemented.

1.  All government agencies, military units, and organizations at all levels, in charge of or undertaking fiscal and tax revenue tasks, and all appropriated funds as well as investments in undertakings and enterprises, shall conduct clearance and settlement based on the actual figures of receipts and payments for the current fiscal year. On the revenue side, the figures submitted to the most basic-level treasury, granary, and material depot from January 1 to December 31 of this year shall be used as the limit. On the expenditure side, the figures already spent by the various receiving agencies and military units from January 1 to December 31 of this year shall be used as the limit. The remaining balance after the settlement shall be returned in full to the treasury and reported to the central government. Grain and materials may be deducted from the budget for the next year with the approval of the corresponding level of financial authorities, and reported separately to the central government.

    For expenditures spanning multiple years, such as basic construction projects, annual final accounts shall first be prepared based on the actual expenditure figures for the current year. A complete expenditure final account shall then be prepared after the project is completed. Materials accumulated in the current year or accounts payable that have not been paid shall be carried over for use in the next year. Revenues spanning multiple years, such as arrears in agricultural tax, shall be included in the revenue budget for the next year and collection shall continue. Tax revenues collected but not yet deposited into the treasury in the current year shall be deposited as revenue for the next year.

    For expenditures of various agencies, military units, and organizations that cannot be settled on time, a preliminary settlement shall be made based on the amount of funds for the current year received from the financial authorities before December 31. When preparing the final accounts, the actual expenditure figures of the respective spending agencies, military units, and organizations shall still be used as the basis.

2.  To control the execution of the budget, all levels of financial authorities shall, based on the actual business conditions of government agencies, military units, organizations, enterprises, and institutions, suspend the issuance of general expense and investment payment orders before December 30 of this year. In case of special needs, strict examination must be conducted before payment can be authorized. All expense and investment payment orders for the current year shall be completely suspended by December 31. All levels of treasuries, granaries, and material depots nationwide shall also suspend disbursements on the same day.

    Payment orders from the previous year shall not be paid by the treasuries in the next year.

3.  After the end of the year, all funds for expenses of all agencies, military units, and organizations, and investments in enterprises and institutions, even if the payment orders have been obtained from the financial authorities before the end of the year but the cash, grain, or materials have not yet been withdrawn from the treasury, shall be suspended, except for materials to be allocated for national defense construction and basic construction, which may be withdrawn as usual with the approval of the Military Commission or local financial committees. The unwithdrawn portion shall be the state's fiscal year-end surplus.

    If cash, grain, or materials are lacking in the treasury and cannot be disbursed, or if agencies, military units, and organizations are stationed far away and cannot return to withdraw them on time, payment may be made as usual with the review and endorsement of the original issuing agency or the local relevant people's government.

4.  After the year-end revenue and expenditure clearance, all agencies shall immediately prepare the annual final accounts for 1950 in accordance with the regulations for issuing final account forms. The consolidated final accounts of the major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the centrally-administered provinces and cities shall be submitted to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government before the end of April 1951. The deadlines for submitting the consolidated final accounts of the people's governments at all levels under their jurisdiction, as well as the final accounts of agencies and units at all levels, shall be determined separately by the people's governments of the respective regions and centrally-administered provinces and cities. The military system shall be handled uniformly by the Military Commission and submitted to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government before the end of April. The central government agencies shall submit to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government before the end of March.

    Various relevant statistical tables shall be attached to the annual final accounts (e.g., personnel, horse, vehicle, and ship establishment tables shall be attached to military and administrative expenses; student, faculty, staff, and student aid recipient number tables shall be attached to schools; and doctor, nurse, and bed number tables shall be attached to hospitals).

5.  All levels of financial authorities shall handle the fiscal revenue and expenditure for the current year in accordance with the actual receipt and payment figures. Expenditures for the next year shall be paid after the beginning of the next year. If, due to special circumstances, it is necessary to prepay expenses for the next year, the prepayment may be noted under the relevant expense item, and transferred to that expense item after the budget for the next year is established, and the carryover from the previous year shall be included in the budget for the next year. Such prepaid expenses shall be approved by the central government or the financial department of the major administrative region; in the centrally-administered provinces and cities, they shall be approved by the financial department or bureau of the respective province or city. The subject and amount of prepaid expenses approved by the major administrative region or the centrally-administered province or city shall be reported to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government before January 31 of the following year.

6.  At the end of the year, all levels of people's governments shall liquidate and organize the fiscal revenue and expenditure for the entire year, and report the revenue and expenditure figures after the clearance to the higher levels step by step. The county (city) people's governments shall report to the province by January 25, the province (city) people's governments shall report to the major administrative region by February 15, the centrally-administered province and city people's governments shall report to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government by February 15, and the major administrative region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region people's governments shall report to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government by March 5. The military system shall be uniformly cleared by the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission and reported to the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government by March 5. The clearance of fiscal revenue and expenditure at all levels shall be reported separately according to the actual figures of cash, grain, and material receipts and payments.

7.  During the fiscal clearance process, if the following are encountered: (1) Expenditures without a budget or with a budget that has not been approved shall not be reimbursed under any circumstances. (2) Unauthorized misappropriation of public funds, public grain, or public property to cover losses from the production of organs shall be fully recovered and shall not be reimbursed.

    一九五零年度即将终了，年度决算，必须按期编送。现为便于整理编造起见，特规定一九五零年度财政收支年终清理的原则如下，望即遵照执行。
    一、各级人民政府机关、部队和团体，所有经管与担负的财政税收任务，和一切支领的经费款项以及事业、企业的投资，均应按照本会计年度收付实现数字，进行清理结算。收入方面，以本年一月一日至十二月三十一日止所交入最基层金库粮库物资库数字为限。支出方面，以本年一月一日至十二月三十一日止各领用机关、部队已开支者为限。结算后的结余，应即全部交还金库，报解中央。粮食、物资，得经各该级财政机关的核准，由下年度预算内扣除，并分别报告中央。
    跨越年度的支出，如基本建设工程等，应先就本年度实际支出数字，编造年度决算，俟工程完竣后，再造全部支出决算。本年度所积存材料，或应付未付款项，均转下年度支用。跨越年度的收入，如农业税尾欠等，应列入下年度收入预算，继续催交，已收之税款，在本年度未及交库者，均作为下年度收入交库。
    各机关部队团体的支出，如未能依限结算者，暂依十二月三十一日以前接到财政机关支付本年度经费数字，先行结算。编造决算时，仍以各开支机关部队团体实际支出数字为根据。
    二、各级财政机关为掌握预算的执行，应根据机关、部队、团体、企业、事业部门的业务实际情况，于本年十二月三十日前，停止签发一般经费及投资支付命令。如有特殊需要，必须经过严格审查，方得签付。截至十二月三十一日止，应即完全停签本年度的一切经费及投资支付命令。全国各级金库、粮库、物资库亦于同日停止支拨。

    如因库内缺乏现金或粮食、物资，未能拨付，或因机关部队团体驻地较远，未及依限赶回提取者，经原签发机关或当地相关人民政府审查签证，得照数支付。
    四、各机关于年度收支清理后，应即依照颁发决算表格的规定，编造一九五零年年度决算。各大行政区、内蒙古自治区、中央直属省、市的总决算，统限于一九五一年四月底以前送达中央财政部。其所属各级人民政府总决算，及各级机关单位决算之编送期限，由各该区及直属省、市人民政府分别规定之。军队系统，由军事委员会统一办理，亦于四月底以前，送达中央财政部。中央各机关于三月底以前，送达中央财政部。

    五、各级财政机关，对于本年度财政收支，应依照实收实付数字处理。下年度的支出，应在下年度开始后支付。如因特殊情形，必须预付下年度的经费，得以预付某项费用科目注账，在下年度预算成立后，转入该项经费支出科目，并以上年度结转列入下年度预算。此项预付经费，由中央或大行政区财政部负责批准；中央直属省、市，由各省、市财政厅、局负责批准。大行政区或直属省、市批准预付经费的科目数字，须于次年一月三十一日前，报告中央财政部。
