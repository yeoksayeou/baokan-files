    (Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch) This reporter's dispatch from the Korean battlefield states: The first group of 103 American invading troops and Syngman Rhee bandit troops captured in the Northwest Korean campaign from October 25th to November 8th have been released. Among those released are 27 American invading soldiers, including one from the 5th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, 21 from the 8th Regiment, four from the 24th Infantry Division, and one from the Chemical Mortar Regiment. There are 76 Syngman Rhee bandit soldiers, including 54 from the 6th Division and 22 from the 8th Division. The wounded among them have been bandaged and treated, and are recovering quickly. Their actual experiences after being captured completely shattered the rumors spread by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang about the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers insulting and killing prisoners. They personally experienced the lenient treatment of prisoners, including not being killed, not having their dignity insulted, not having their pockets searched, and not having their personal belongings confiscated. Even some who held reactionary political views had to admit that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were extremely well-educated troops, and such troops are invincible. This release made them even more sincerely grateful. Many American soldiers even shaved their beards. Before their release, personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers managing the prisoners exposed to them the war crimes committed by American imperialism in Korea and its conspiracy to invade the world, pointing out that neither the soldiers of the American invading forces nor the Syngman Rhee bandit troops wanted war; they were forced to participate in the war to slaughter working people. The common enemies of the American, Korean, Chinese, and people of the whole world are the American Wall Street bosses and warlords, while Syngman Rhee is a running dog and traitor at the disposal of American imperialism. All the released prisoners unanimously stated that they would take these truths back to their own troops and publicize them, and no longer participate in wars of aggression. When they parted with the personnel managing the prisoners and the cadres escorting them, they repeatedly said "Thank you" and shook hands warmly.

    朝鲜西北部战役中
    被俘美李匪军百人获释
    他们衷心感激宽待，表示要向美李匪军宣传，不再参加侵略战争。
    【新华社二日讯】本社记者从朝鲜战场发来的消息称：在十月二十五日至十一月八日朝鲜西北部战役中被俘的美国侵略军与李承晚匪军首批一○三人，已获释放。此次释放的，计有美国侵略军士兵二十七人，内美骑兵第一师第五团一人，第八团二十一人，美步兵第二十四师四人，美化学迫击炮团一人。李承晚匪军士兵七十六人，内有第六师五十四人，第八师二十二人。其中的伤员已经给予包扎治疗，已快痊愈。他们被俘后的实际经历，完全粉碎了美国侵略者与李承晚匪帮关于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队侮辱杀害俘虏的谣言。他们亲身受到了对俘虏不杀害、不侮辱人格、不搜腰包、不没收个人财物的宽待。连若干在政治上持有反动观点的人，也不得不承认朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队是十分有教养的军队，这样的军队是不可战胜的。此次释放更使他们衷心感激。许多美国士兵并且刮了胡子。释放前，中国人民志愿部队管理俘虏的人员向他们揭破了美国帝国主义在朝鲜所制造的战争罪行及其侵略全世界的阴谋，指出无论美国侵略军或李承晚匪军的士兵都是不愿战争的，他们是被迫参加屠杀劳动人民的战争。美国、朝鲜、中国和全世界人民的共同敌人是美国华尔街老板和军阀，而李承晚则是供美帝国主义驱使的走狗和卖国贼。全体被释放的俘虏均一致表示：要把这些道理带回去向他们自己的军队作宣传，不再参加侵略战争。当他们与管理俘虏人员及遣送俘虏干部分别时，连说“谢谢”，并热情地握手。
