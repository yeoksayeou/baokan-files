Investigation Report on Agricultural Production Increase in 102 Villages of Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province

I. Overview of Production Increase

The agricultural production increase movement of 1950 was carried out under the constant overcoming of simplistic agricultural socialist thinking, empiricism, bureaucratism, administrative commandism among cadres, mobilizing the masses to overcome various disasters, and implementing the agricultural production policy of "organizing together and increasingly combining with new technologies" put forward by the Shanxi Provincial Party Congress. According to a survey of 102 villages, the average actual yield per mu before the war was 1 stone, 1 dou, and 6.2 sheng; last year it was 1 stone, 1 dou, and 6.4 sheng; and this year it was 1 stone, 3 dou, 0 he, and 2.5 ge, exceeding last year's yield by 1 dou, 3 sheng, and 8.5 ge per mu, successfully completing this year's target of a 10% increase in production.

II. Reasons for the Achievements

1.  The quantity of organization has increased, and the quality has improved.

    A. Mutual Aid Teams. First, looking at the quantity: there are a total of 20,484 households. Last year, those participating in mutual aid accounted for 25.6% of the total number of households, while this year it is 26.2%, exceeding last year by 0.6%. There are a total of 31,513 laborers (including both male and female half-laborers, each counted as 0.2), last year those participating in mutual aid accounted for 23.2% of the total labor force, while this year it is 25.6%, exceeding last year by 2.4%. There are a total of 9,340 head of livestock, last year those participating in mutual aid accounted for 25% of the total livestock, while this year it is 29%, exceeding last year by 4%. There are a total of 291,415 mu of land, last year those participating in mutual aid accounted for 24.8% of the total land, while this year it is 26.3%, exceeding last year by 1.5%. Last year, there were a total of 562 mutual aid teams, while this year there are 861, an increase of 299 over last year.

    Second, looking at the quality: The characteristics of the first type of team are: voluntary equivalent exchange, long-term work exchange, but the technology is not prominent enough. There were 291 such teams last year, and 522 this year, an increase of 231 over last year. This is because some that were not organized last year have been organized this year, and some have also been upgraded to the second and third types. The characteristics of the second type are: voluntary equivalent exchange, technical division of labor, combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, and the beginning of the adoption of new scientific technologies such as processing and fertilization, and seed soaking and mixing. Its experience is: (1) Mutual aid teams are more efficient in adopting new technologies than individual farming, and it is easier to promote them. (2) In the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, surplus rural labor can be appropriately resolved. There were 224 such teams last year, and 262 this year, an increase of 38 over last year. The third type of team is voluntary equivalent exchange, technical division of labor, and emphasis on technology. It has a history of seven or eight years and is relatively consolidated. Its development is from small to large. Its characteristics are: (1) It has been consolidated for several years, improving technology, developing production, and producing more grain. For example, the Guo Yu'en team has increased its average yield per mu by 60% compared to before the war, and the Huo Fuchun team has increased its average yield per mu by 8 dou compared to when it was not organized. (2) There is a relatively scientific division of labor, giving play to specialized skills. The team members have realized that in order to cultivate the land well, they must organize together to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses. (3) The most prominent thing is that the mutual aid team has adopted the method of public purchase and use of large agricultural implements. This characteristic has emerged within the mutual aid team, developed production, and gradually developed on the basis of the establishment of new production relations. The experience of this type of team is: (1) Collective purchase of large agricultural implements under the principle of voluntary participation by farmers is beneficial to the development of production and creates conditions for the promotion of new-style agricultural implements. (2) Because it better implements the principle of equivalent exchange on the basis of individual economy, new production relations have emerged within the mutual aid team. (3) Due to the adoption of new technologies, processing and fertilization, and improved production, the vast majority of team members have become prosperous, and the team members have affirmed the path of organizing together to develop production in their thinking. There were 47 such teams last year, and 77 this year.

    In addition, there are a large number of small, temporary work-exchange teams, but because their characteristic is that they are not fixed, they are not listed as a separate category. Strictly speaking, it can only be regarded as the foundation of organization and cannot be called a mutual aid team; but as long as a few people are together for temporary work-exchange mutual assistance, it is always more efficient than individual farming in developing production.

    B. Cooperatives. After a year of rectification, there are 450 primary-level cooperatives in the entire district, accounting for 27.76% of the total, which basically comply with the provisions of the Cooperative Law; there are 384 primary-level cooperatives, accounting for 23.69% of the total, which have generally been rectified, but the concept of serving the members is not clear enough; 691 have not been rectified, accounting for 42.62%; and 96 have been suspended or collapsed, accounting for 5.93%. Although only half of them have been rectified, more than 97,000 new members have been developed, and more than 1.18 million jin of millet have been expanded in funds, which have played a great role in exchanging materials and driving production. According to statistics from January to September, the total supply and sales value of the special district and county cooperatives was more than 40,917,744 yuan, reducing intermediate exploitation by more than 10,092,890 yuan. Generally, the contract system has been learned to use. From January to September, a total of 4,119 contracts were signed (statistics from special cooperatives are missing), including seven types of content such as agency purchase, agency sales, exchange, transportation, loans, ordering, and advance purchase. Through the contract system, the exchange of materials has become more organized and planned, strengthening the connection with the state-owned economy, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient funds, and ensuring the state-owned economy's purchase and sales tasks; especially the advance purchase contract, which has played a certain role in stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for production and eliminating farmers' concerns about the sales of their products. In particular, the specification requirements in the contract promote its processing and pay attention to technical improvement. 38% of primary-level cooperatives have established cooperative worker representative conferences to strengthen the planning of their business. The cooperative worker representative conference has played a role in exchanging experiences, improving cadre level, and strengthening the connection between superiors and subordinates. Credit cooperatives have also been established, which have played a great role in absorbing the idle funds of the masses, because the idle funds of the masses always need to find a way out. If they are not organized, these idle funds will spontaneously develop in the direction of capitalism.

2.  Scientific and technological technologies have begun to be adopted, and inherent technologies have been universally improved.

    Number of tillage passes: Before the war, those tilling once accounted for 30.4%, twice for 59.5%, and three times for 10.1%. Last year, those tilling once accounted for 15%, twice for 65.6%, and three times for 18.9%. This year, those tilling once accounted for 6.93%, twice for 62.5%, and three times for 30.5%.

    Fertilization: Before the war, the average application of base fertilizer was 38 dan per mu, and the application of top dressing was 12.7 dan. Last year, the average application of base fertilizer was 47.2 dan per mu, and the application of top dressing was 16.5 dan. This year, the average application of base fertilizer was 50.4 dan per mu, and the application of top dressing was 17.3 dan.

    Variety improvement: Last year, seed soaking and mixing accounted for 18%, and this year it accounted for 42%. Last year, seed exchange accounted for 13.4%, and this year it accounted for 21.8%. This fall, 4,407 shi, 3 dou, and 8 sheng of seeds were selected, reaching 82.7% of the required seeds, of which 69.8% were selected in the field and 30.2% were selected in the yard. The promotion of improved varieties, for example, in five villages in Qinyuan, 250 mu were promoted.

    Number of weeding passes: Before the war, those weeding once accounted for 18.8%, twice for 68.5%, three times for 12.6%, and 1% did not weed. Last year, those weeding once accounted for 8.1%, twice for 53.8%, three times for 35.9%, and more than four times for 2.2%. This year, those weeding once accounted for 4.5%, twice for 40.7%, three times for 49.4%, and more than four times for 5.4%.

    Technical guidance: 98% of the villages have established technical guidance committees to provide specific technical guidance. The farm regularly contacts dozens of specially invited farmers, and many labor models delineate certain plots of land to conduct various technical experiments, using typical examples to promote and practically guide, which is enthusiastically supported by the masses.

    Draught animals: This year has also increased a lot. Before the war, there were 10,198 head of livestock, 10,296 head last year, and 11,398 head this year, excluding those sold or died.

    Agricultural implements: Not only has the quantity increased, but the transformation of old-style agricultural implements and the use of new-style agricultural implements have become the requirements of the broad masses. Compared with last year, plows have increased by 10.7%, hoes by 13.61%, shovels and picks by 13%, harrows by 8.07%, carts by 11.6%, and seeders by 379. The transformation of old agricultural implements, such as changing three-legged seeders to two-legged ones, has been carried out in about two-thirds of Changzhi alone; and the transformation of earth weeding hoes and the invention of new-style weeding hoes are available in various counties. For example, the Dengyun hoe in Yuncheng, and the Huo seeder in Xiangyuan and Lingchuan, etc. The promotion of liberation-style agricultural implements has been welcomed by the masses. More than 300 liberation-style agricultural implements transported back from the special county have been tested in various counties. The seven-inch stepped plow is 30% more efficient than the earthen plow, and the weeder is three to five times more efficient than the earthen hoe. Sprayers and threshers are even more welcomed by the masses everywhere.

    Water conservancy construction: According to statistics from 87 villages, there are a total of 62 waterwheels (19 were originally available last year, and 43 were newly added this year), which can irrigate a total of 565 mu of land. There are a total of 81 canals, 56 last year, 15 newly opened this year, and 9 old canals repaired, which can irrigate 1,656.3 mu of land. There are a total of 1,289 irrigated wells, which can irrigate 3,499.8 mu of land, 146 newly dug this year, and 53 old ones repaired. These guaranteed that the seedlings would not die in this year's drought resistance struggle. The masses in Yangcheng reflected that they really saw that man can conquer nature.

3.  The County People's Representative Conference and the Village-level People's Representative Conference are the best organizational forms for carrying out the production movement.

    Each county has held two to three sessions of the People's Representative Conference, and the specific arrangements for each stage of work in the village have been discussed and arranged at the People's Representative Conference. All strata have understood the Party's production policy, broken down some production concerns, and also overcome the closed-doorism and laissez-faire thinking of abandoning leadership among Party members and cadres. They feel that as long as the role of the People's Representative Conference and the People's Representative Conference can be fully utilized, it is like adding hundreds of cadres; at the same time, it has also played a great role in the construction of the branch: strengthening the Party's leadership over production can overcome the administrative commandism and the ideological style of not leading production of the branch members, can overcome the branch's subjective and unrealistic plans, and can strengthen the activity ability of each Party member and the branch's leadership role in planning, inspecting, and summarizing experience in production.

4.  Carrying out production competitions and cultivating a large number of labor model activists is the best leadership method for carrying out the production movement.

    This year, we have grasped this leadership method, summarized Li Shunda's experience in organizing and developing production, launched the entire district to learn from Li Shunda, carried out production competitions, and launched comparisons between villages and villages, between groups and groups, and comparisons between organized and individual farming. At the end of each movement, it becomes a mass summary of experience, selection of labor models, and promotion of the next stage of the movement, so that each movement is tense and lively. According to statistics from 102 villages, the number of people elected by the masses as labor model activists accounts for 9.9% of the total labor force.

5.  The decisive link in carrying out the production movement lies in the leadership of the branch.

    This year, the branch has grasped the main contents of leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement and improving technology, and has specifically realized that to lead production with production, it is necessary to learn technology and master technology, only in this way can we truly realize the leading role. At the same time, only by regularly checking the activities of Party members in the production movement and combining the summary of production with the assessment of Party members can we truly achieve the branch's leadership of production and the construction of the branch in production. According to a survey of the performance of Party members in the 102 village branches in the production movement, 38% of the Party members can actively lead production and become the backbone of the production movement, 49% of the Party members can generally participate in leadership, but cannot become the backbone, and 13% of the Party members do not lead production.

    The Changzhi Special District includes the counties of Changzhi, Changzi, Tunliu, Wuxiang, Qinyuan, Xiangyuan, Licheng, Yuncheng, Huguan, Pingshun, Gaoping, Jincheng, Yangcheng, Qin County, and Lingchuan.

    山西省长治专区一○二村的农业增产调查报告
    一、增产概况
    一九五○年的农业增产运动，是在不断克服干部中的单纯农业社会主义思想、经验主义、官僚主义、行政命令作风、发动群众战胜各种灾害、贯彻省委党代会议提出的“组织起来日益与新的技术相结合”的农业生产方针之下进行的。现据一百零二个村的调查：战前每亩平均实产量为一石一斗六升二，去年为一石一斗六升四，今年为一石三斗零二合五，每亩超过去年一斗三升八合五，胜利地完成了今年增产一成的要求。
  二、取得成绩的原因
    一、组织起来的数量有增加，质量有提高。
    甲、互助组。首先从数量上看：共有二万零四百八十四户。去年参加互助的占总户数的百分之二十五点六，今年则为百分之二十六点二，超过去年百分之零点六。共有劳力三万一千五百一十三个（其中男女半劳力均以二折一计），去年参加互助的占总劳力的百分之二十三点二，今年则为百分之二十五点六，超过去年的百分之二点四。共有畜力九千三百四十头，去年参加互助的占总畜力的百分之二十五，今年则为百分之二十九，超过去年的百分之四。共有土地二十九万一千四百一十五亩，去年参加互助的占总土地的百分之二十四点八，今年则为百分之二十六点三，超过去年的百分之一点五。去年共有互助组五百六十二个，今年则为八百六十一个，比去年增加二百九十九个。
    其次从质量上看：第一类组的特点是：自愿等价，长期拨工，但技术上不够突出，这类组去年有二百九十一个，今年有五百二十二个，比去年增加二百三十一个，这是因去年没有组织起来的今年组织起来了，同时也有提高到二、三类的。第二类的特点是：自愿等价，技术分工，农副业结合，新的科学技术与加工加肥、浸拌种籽，开始采用。它的经验是：（１）以互助组采用新的技术比单干采用效率大，而便于推广。（２）在农副业结合中可以适当地解决农村剩余劳力，这类组去年有二百二十四个，今年有二百六十二个，比去年增加三十八个。第三类组是自愿等价，技术分工，讲求技术。它已有七八年的历史而且比较巩固。它的发展是由小到大。它的特点是：（１）在几年中都是巩固的，提高了技术，发展了生产，多打了粮食。如郭玉恩组每亩较战前平均增产百分之六十，霍富春组平均每亩超过未组织起来时的八斗。（２）有了较科学的技术分工，发挥专长。组员们已认识到想种好地，必须组织起来取长补短。（３）最突出的是，互助组内采用了大农具公共购买使用办法，这一特点是产生在互助组内部发展了生产，新的生产关系开始建立的基础上并逐渐发展起来的。这类组的经验是：（１）在农民自愿的原则下集体购买大农具，对发展生产是有利的，给推广新式农具创造了条件。（２）由于它在个体经济的基础上更好地执行了等价政策，所以互助组内部已有了新的生产关系。（３）由于采用了新的技术，加工加肥，提高了生产，绝大部分的组员都富裕起来了，组员们在思想上对走组织起来发展生产的道路是肯定下来了。这类组去年有四十七个，今年已有七十七个。
    另外是大量的小型的临时拨工组，因它的特点是不固定，所以没有专列一类。严格说来，它只能算是组织起来的基础，还不能称为互助组；但只要是几个人在一起的临时拨工互助，总比单干在发展生产上效率大。
    乙、合作社，经过一年的整顿，全区有四百五十个基层社，占总数的百分之二十七点七六，大体合乎合作法的规定；有三百八十四个占总数的百分之二十三点六九的基层社，一般经过整顿，但为社员服务的观点还不够明确；未加整顿的有六百九十一个占百分之四十二点六二；已停顿垮台的有九十六个占百分之五点九三。虽然只有半数经过整顿，但发展新社员九万七千余人，扩大资金一百一十八万余斤小米，在交流物资、带动生产上都起了很大的作用。据一至九月份的统计，专区、县社的供销总值为四百零九万一千七百四十四万余元，减轻中间剥削十万零九千二百八十九万余元。一般的学会使用合同制，一至九月份共订合同四千一百一十九次（缺专社的统计），其中包括有代购、代销、交换、运输、贷款、订购、预购等七种内容。经过合同制，使物资交流有了组织性与计划性，加强了与国营经济的联系，克服了资金不足的困难，保证了国营经济的收购、推销任务；特别是预购合同，对刺激农民生产积极性与消除农民产品销路的顾虑起了一定的作用。尤其是合同中规格的规定，促使其加工，注意技术的提高。有百分之三十八的基层社建立了合作社工作代表会议，加强了业务的计划性。合作社工作者代表会议起了交流经验、提高干部水平、密切上下级联系的作用。又建立了信贷社，对吸收群众游资起了很大作用，因群众的游资总是要找出路的，如不加以组织，这种游资将会自流地向资本主义的方向发展。
    二、科学技术开始采用，固有技术普遍提高。
    耕地遍数：战前耕一遍的占百分之三十点四，二遍的占百分之五十九点五，三遍的占百分之十点一。去年耕一遍的占百分之十五，二遍的占百分之六十五点六，三遍的占百分之十八点九。今年耕一遍的占百分之六点九三，二遍的占百分之六十二点五，三遍的占百分之三十点五。
    施肥：战前每亩平均上底肥三十八担，上追肥十二担七。去年每亩平均上底肥四十七担二，上追肥十六担五。今年每亩平均上底肥五十担四，上追肥十七担三。
    改良品种：去年浸拌种为百分之十八，今年为百分之四十二。去年调种占百分之十三点四，今年占百分之二十一点八。今年秋季选种四千四百零七石三斗八升，达到所需种籽的百分之八十二点七，其中田选的为百分之六十九点八，场选的为百分之三十点二。推广优良品种只沁源五个村即推广二百五十亩。
    锄苗遍数：战前锄一遍的占百分之十八点八，锄二遍的占百分之六十八点五，锄三遍的占百分之十二点六，还有百分之一不上锄的。去年锄一遍的占百分之八点一，锄二遍的占百分之五十三点八，锄三遍的占百分之三十五点九，锄四遍以上的占百分之二点二。今年锄一遍的占百分之四点五，锄二遍的占百分之四十点七，锄三遍的占百分之四十九点四，锄四遍以上的占百分之五点四。
    技术指导：有百分之九十八的村成立了技术指导委员会，具体指导技术。农场经常联系有数十个特约农家，不少劳模划定一定地段进行各种技术试验，以典型推动，实际指导，受到群众热烈拥护。
    耕畜：今年也增加不少，战前有畜力一万零一百九十八头，去年为一万零二百九十六头，今年除去卖掉死掉的，实有一万一千三百九十八头。
    农具：不仅数量增加，改造旧式农具，使用新式农具，已成为广大群众的要求。旧式农具与去年比，犁增加百分之十点七，锄增加百分之十三点六一，锨镢增加百分之十三，耙增加百分之八点零七，车增加百分之十一点六，耧增加三百七十九张。旧农具的改造如三条腿耧改为两条腿的仅长治即改造三分之二左右；土耘锄的改造与新式耘锄的发明，各县都有。如郓城的登云锄，襄垣、陵川的霍耧等，解放式农具的推广，已得到群众欢迎。由专县运回来的三百余件解放式农具，经各县实验，七寸步犁较土犁效率高百分之三十，耘锄较土锄效率高三倍至五倍。喷雾器、脱粒机更到处受到群众欢迎。
    水利建设：据八十七个村的统计，共有水车六十二架（去年原有十九架，今年新增四十三架），共可浇地五百六十五亩。水渠共八十一条，去年有五十六条，今年新开十五条，修旧渠九条，可浇地一千六百五十六亩三分。共有浇地水井一千二百八十九眼，可浇地三千四百九十九亩八分，今年新打的一百四十六眼，修旧的五十三眼。这些在今年的抗旱斗争中保证了禾苗不死。阳城群众反映，这才真正看到了人定能够胜天。
    三、县各界人民代表会议与村级人民代表会议，是开展生产运动的最好组织形式。
    各县都开过二次到三次的各代会，村里每段工作都在人代会上具体讨论布置。各阶层对党的生产政策摸到了底，打破了某些生产顾虑，在党员、干部中也克服了关门主义与放弃领导的自流思想，感到只要能充分发挥人代会、各代会的作用，就如同增加了千百个干部；同时对支部建设也起了很大作用：加强了党对生产的领导，可以克服支部党员的行政命令与不领导生产的思想作风，可以克服支部的主观主义的不切合实际的计划，可以加强每个党员的活动能力与支部对生产的计划、检查、总结经验的领导作用。
    四、开展生产竞赛，大量培养劳模积极分子，是开展生产运动的最好领导方法。
    今年抓住了这一领导方法，总结了李顺达组织起来、生产发家的经验，发动全区学习李顺达，开展生产竞赛，展开了村与村比，组与组比，组织起来与单干的对比。在每个运动的总结时，就成为群众性的总结经验、评选劳模，并推动下一阶段的运动，因而使每个运动表现紧张活泼。据一百零二个村的统计，被群众选为劳模积极分子的人数占全部劳力的百分之九点九。
    五、开展生产运动的决定环节，在于支部的领导。
    今年支部抓住了领导互助合作运动与提高技术的主要内容，具体体会了以生产领导生产必须学习技术，掌握技术，只有这样才能真正的实现带头作用。同时也只有在生产运动中经常检查党员的活动，把总结生产与鉴定党员相结合，才能真正的作到支部领导生产与在生产中建设支部。据一百零二个村支部党员在生产运动中表现的调查，有百分之三十八的党员能积极领导生产，成为生产运动中的骨干，有百分之四十九的党员一般的能参加领导，但不能成为骨干，有百分之十三的党员不领导生产。
    按长治专区共包括县，计长治、长子、屯留、武乡、沁水、沁源、襄垣、黎城、郓城、壶关、平顺、高平、晋城、阳城、沁县、陵川。
