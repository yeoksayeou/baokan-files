Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch: Since the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries' eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting proposed opposing the re-militarization of West Germany and the restoration of German unity on October 22nd, the West German people's movement against the war policies of the American, British, and French occupying authorities has increasingly developed into a broad mass movement. People everywhere have been holding mass rallies, demanding the implementation of the proposals in the eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting declaration.

According to Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur (ADN): The German Communist Party recently held a mass rally of 2,500 people in Nuremberg, in the American zone of West Germany. The assembly passed a letter to the head of the Bonn separatist government, demanding the adoption of the proposals in the Prague declaration of the eight foreign ministers. The letter stated: "The re-militarization policy being implemented by the Bonn government will inevitably cause a nationwide disaster. We hope for peace, so please do not reject the hand of mutual understanding extended to us, and prepare to convene a meeting of representatives from the East and West for discussions in the interests of the German people, in order to eliminate the threat of another world war."

A mass rally was held in the West Berlin district of Massanehli on November 15th to discuss the eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting declaration. Participants included many working people, housewives, and unemployed people from West Berlin. Hoffman, Vice Chairman of the Berlin Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany, declared at the meeting: "We will do everything in our power to achieve German unity."

According to ADN: Communists, Social Democrats, Christian Socialists, and non-partisan workers in Essen held a joint meeting on November 16th to discuss the eight-nation foreign ministers' meeting declaration. The workers demanded that negotiations begin immediately with representatives of the German Democratic Republic to establish an all-German constitutional assembly. Many lower-level members of the West German Social Democratic Party also held a meeting in Korbermoor, near Rosenheim in Bavaria in the American zone, and passed a resolution demanding the implementation of the proposals in the Prague declaration.

The people of Wadenburg have launched a signature campaign against the militarization of West Germany. Ninety-five percent of the personnel at the "Profeut" company in Nuremberg and 184 out of 196 residents in the Nickenheim district near Aschaffenburg in Bavaria have jointly published declarations opposing the arming of West Germany. Thousands of such jointly published declarations now exist.

The *Hamburger Volkszeitung* pointed out: The Prague proposals can no longer be ignored. Every German who knows it, has heard of it, and cares about peace and German unity says: it provides the only path for Germany.

    西德人民展开广泛群众运动
    要求实现八国外长会议建议
    【新华社二十九日讯】自从苏联及东欧人民民主国家八国外长会议于十月二十二日提出反对西德重新军事化与恢复德国统一的建议以来，西德人民反对美、英、法占领当局战争政策的运动，已日益发展成为广泛群众性的运动。各地人民纷纷召开群众大会，要求实现八国外长会议声明的建议。
    据德意志通讯社消息：德国共产党最近曾在西德美占区纽伦堡召开了二千五百人的群众大会。大会通过致函波恩分裂派政府的首脑，要求采纳八国外长布拉格会议声明的建议。函内称：“波恩政府正在实行的重新军事化的政策，不可避免地将造成全国性的灾难。我们希望和平，因此请你不要拒绝向我们伸来互谅的手，而为了德国人民的利益筹备召开东西两部代表的会议进行讨论，以便消除另一次世界大战的威胁。”
    柏林西区马萨纳利于十一月十五日举行了群众大会，讨论八国外长会议声明，参加大会者有柏林西区许多劳动人民、家庭主妇和失业人员。民主德国全国阵线柏林委员会副主席郝夫曼在会上宣称：“我们要尽一切力量去达成德国的统一。”
    据电通社消息：在埃森的共产党、社会民主党、基督教社会党人与无党派的工人，于十一月十六日举行联席会议，讨论八国外长会议声明。工人们要求立即开始与德意志民主共和国代表举行谈判，建立全德立宪议会。西德社会民主党许多下层党员，也在美占区巴伐利亚州罗森汉附近科尔柏莫尔地方举行了会议，通过决议要求实现布拉格声明的建议。
    瓦登堡人民发起签名反对西德军事化的运动。纽伦堡“普洛费特”公司人员中已有百分之九十五、巴伐利亚州阿沙芬堡附近尼克海姆区居民一百九十六人中已有一百八十四人联名发表了反对武装西德的宣言。现在这样联名发表的宣言已数以千计。
    《汉堡人民日报》指出：布拉格建议已不能够不加理会了。凡是知道它，听见过它而且关心和平与德国统一的每一个德国人都说：它为德国提供了唯一的一条道路。
