Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article by Petukhov about the French youth patriot Michel Bodin. Petukhov wrote: Bodin's name is currently being praised by the young men and women of Bordeaux. Four months ago, this young French army soldier, 20-year-old paratrooper Bodin, was arrested and imprisoned in a dark dungeon in the fortress. He was accused of "undermining morale and deliberately endangering national defense." In fact, Bodin—a true patriot of his country—was against the filthy war in Vietnam. He had distributed leaflets among his comrades condemning the war in Vietnam and the extension of military service. For four months, Bodin languished in a filthy cell, awaiting trial. For four months, he saw nothing but a small patch of gray sky through the iron bars of his cell window—all this simply because he wanted peace and hated war. He joined the ranks of peace advocates in Le Havre, when he had not yet enlisted. He wrote slogans on the sidewalks of Le Havre, "Houses, not guns!" and it was there that he was first arrested. Bodin understood very well what war was all about. He remembered the horrific bombing of Le Havre by American planes. He did not want the nightmare of war to befall the houses of Bordeaux, France, one of which was home to his four-month-old baby.

Petukhov continued: On December 12, Bodin was brought before the Bordeaux military court. The corrupt judges met for two days. On December 14, Bodin was sentenced to eight months in prison. Many delegations from the working people of Bordeaux came to the building where the military court was located, where the American running dogs were trying this true Frenchman. The staunch people of Bordeaux firmly protested the trial of this true French patriot. Moreover, as often happens in Marshallized France these days, the trial of Bodin, instigated by the enraged reactionaries, turned into a forum for the people to accuse their bankrupt rulers. The defendant's lawyers and witnesses once again exposed the criminal nature of the war of aggression against the Vietnamese people.

The author continued: The events in Bordeaux clearly show what is happening in France. The ruling clique, which is currying favor with the American imperialists, is using terror to deal with the outstanding sons and daughters of the French people. The freedom-loving French people, who have lived through the dark days of fascist occupation, have united to oppose the reactionaries who are now on the offensive. The authorities tried to silence Bodin by throwing him in jail. But his voice is louder and more powerful, and more determined than ever. The voices of tens of thousands of young men and women in Bordeaux have joined his, and they are continuing Bodin's struggle. They are holding high a banner on which Bodin's name is listed alongside the names of Henri Martin, Raymonda Diène, and other French heroes. Petukhov concluded: Neither the police nor the corrupt judges can take this banner from their strong hands.

### 法国和平战士波丁  苏联共青真理报专文

    法国和平战士波丁
    苏联共青真理报专文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：“共青真理报”刊载彼图霍夫一篇关于法国青年爱国者米契尔·波丁的专文。彼图霍夫写道：波丁的名字目前正被波尔多的青年男女啧啧称道。四个月前，这个年青的法国陆军士兵，二十岁的伞兵波丁，被逮捕而且被关进要塞阴暗的地牢里。他被指控“破坏士气，蓄意危害国防”。其实波丁——他的祖国的真正爱国志士——是反对在越南进行卑污的战争。他曾在他的同志之间散发谴责越南战争和延长兵役的传单。四个月以来，波丁在污秽的牢房里憔悴，等待审判。四个月以来，除了透过牢窗的铁栅看到一小片灰色的天空以外，他什么也看不见——这一切仅仅是因为他要和平而恨战争。他是在哈佛尔参加和平拥护者的队伍的，那时，他还未入伍，他在哈佛尔的行人道上书写“要房屋，不要枪炮！”的标语，就在那里他第一次被捕了。波丁十分明白战争是什么一回事。他记得美国飞机对哈佛尔的恐怖轰炸。他不希望战争的梦魇降临法国波尔多的房屋，这些房屋中有一间住着他四个月的婴儿。
    彼图霍夫继续写道：十二月十二日，波丁被波尔多军事法庭提审。贪赃枉法的法官们开了两天会。十二月十四日，波丁被判处了八个月徒刑。波尔多劳动人民的许多代表团纷纷来到军事法庭所在的大厦，美国人的走狗们就在这里审判这个真正的法国人。坚强不屈的波尔多坚决抗议审讯这个真正的法国爱国志士。而且，正如马歇尔化的法国目前常常发生的情形一样，暴跳如雷的反动派所唆使的对波丁的审讯，竟变成人民控诉他们破了产的统治者的讲坛。被告的辩护士与证人又一次揭露了进攻越南人民的战争的罪恶性质。
    作者继称：波尔多的事件清楚地表明了法国正在发生什么事情。向美帝国主义者献媚的统治集团，用恐怖的手段来对付法国人民优秀的儿女。在法西斯暗无天日的占领之下生活过来的爱好自由的法国人民，一致起来反对现正采取攻势的反动派。当局竭力要让波丁沉默，便把他投进监狱里。但是，他的声音却更加宏亮有力，而且更加坚决了。波尔多成千成万青年男女的声音，已经和他的声音汇合起来，他们继续进行波丁的斗争。他们高举着一面旗帜，上面波丁的名字和亨利·马丁、雷蒙达·第安以及其他法国英雄的名字并列。彼图霍夫最后写道：无论是警察或是腐败的法官，都不能把这面旗帜从他们强有力的手中夺下来。
