Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. Land reform is being comprehensively carried out in East China. New atmospheres have appeared in rural areas where land has been distributed. Based on the preparatory work for land reform over the past year, the urgent demands of the masses in various places, and the needs of the current situation, the East China Military and Political Committee has decided that the entire East China region, except for some areas in Fujian and the severely affected disaster areas in northern Anhui, should strive to basically complete the land reform task around April of next year.

Since February of this year, East China has followed the instructions of the Military and Political Committee and carried out various preparatory works related to land reform. After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the Central People's Government, the East China Military and Political Committee, in mid-July, also passed the East China Land Reform Implementation Measures. Subsequently, people's representative conferences and peasant representative conferences were held successively in various provinces and administrative regions. Local CCP organizations in various places also convened party representative conferences to discuss the specific implementation measures for land reform. Government agencies and mass organizations at all levels have systematically studied the Land Reform Law and universally launched propaganda and education work on land reform through various forums and lectures. During this period, the entire region trained more than 176,000 land reform work cadres according to plan. These cadres have greatly improved their political thinking and rectified their work style after training. They have now gone to the countryside one after another. Land Reform Committees and People's Courts at the county level and above have also been established successively. Through movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, implementing reasonable burdens, and production for disaster relief, the peasant masses in various places have been initially mobilized. The number of peasant association members in the entire East China region has reached 24 million.

More Than 1,000 Townships Have Completed Land Reform
Peasants Say: "Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Are Happy to Get Land, Middle Peasants are Satisfied with the Benefits, Rich Peasants are Reassured, and Landlords are Returning to Their Senses Through Labor."

Since the beginning of July, all provinces and regions have selected typical experiments in land reform, including various types of townships (villages). By mid-September, 13 townships had completed land distribution. The East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee convened the first summary meeting of typical experimental land reform work at this time. After summarizing the experience of this stage, the land reform movement in various places entered the second stage of "typical breakthroughs, gradual advancement" (i.e., first break through typical townships, then gradually promote the movement to the surrounding areas, and then shift the focus of work to another typical township for breakthrough and promotion). As of November 15th, according to statistics from various places: in the old areas, 8,341 villages in Shandong and 2,212 townships in northern Jiangsu have completed land certification and ended land reform. A total of 1,183 townships in the new areas have completed land reform. Sixteen counties in the entire East China region have been fully launched, and 21 districts have completed land distribution. In the partial deployment, the movement is progressing relatively smoothly. Hired and poor peasants urgently demand land and generally express satisfaction after receiving land. Middle peasants originally had concerns about drawing too much rented land, but after class education, their mood became more positive. Rich peasants originally suspected that preserving the rich peasant economy was false, but they were reassured after the land reform and requested to join the peasant association. Most landlords in the countryside have shown that they have bowed their heads, and some have begun to participate in labor production. Peasants described the situation of all classes in the countryside after land reform as: "Poor peasants and hired laborers are happy to get land, middle peasants are satisfied with the benefits, rich peasants are reassured, and landlords are returning to their senses through labor." In villages that have completed land reform, the consciousness and production enthusiasm of peasants have generally increased, mass organizations have developed, and militia have been established and developed. Rural political power has also been further transformed, and cultural activities have also been carried out.

Shortcomings in the Movement:
Suppression of Landlords Was Not Timely Enough, Mass Mobilization Was Not Sufficient; Some Cadres Took Over Everything, and Some Areas Ended Hastily.

However, there are still some shortcomings in the movement. First, the suppression of landlords' sabotage was not timely enough, and mass mobilization was not sufficient. The behavior of illegal landlords resisting and sabotaging land reform was more common in various places, especially using the US imperialist aggression against Korea to spread rumors and scare peasants. In individual areas, there were even incidents of landlords beating cadres, burning houses, killing cadres, and organizing disturbances. This has begun to change after emphasizing suppression. Second, there are varying degrees of cadre substitution phenomena in the movement in different regions; in individual regions, there are also phenomena of being tight at the beginning and loose at the end, and ending hastily. In individual places, there are phenomena of elevating the class, excluding middle peasants, and relying on poor and hired peasants in the implementation of policies that are not clear enough, and individual village cadres also have more fruit. In mid-November, the East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee convened the second summary meeting of typical experimental land reform, further summarized the experience of combining points and areas, criticized and corrected the shortcomings existing in the movement, and determined the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses and boldly launching the movement. Specific arrangements have also been made for rural work that has ended land reform. In addition, at this meeting, the southern Anhui region put forward more systematic opinions on the policy of dividing mountains in land reform in mountainous areas. Shandong also provided more complete experience on ending land reform in the old areas. The meeting resolved some specific problems discovered in the gradual deployment of the movement in various places.

At this point, the land reform movement in East China, based on preparations and experience, has gradually moved to a new stage of "combining points and areas, comprehensive expansion." Based on the experience of the previous stage, various places are further rectifying the ideological style of cadres and unifying the understanding of cadres; and especially emphasizing in-depth inspection and bold mobilization of the masses in the movement, so that the movement can develop soundly. According to the current situation, it is estimated that except for some areas in Fujian and the severely affected disaster areas in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, and Shandong can basically complete land reform by the end of February next year, and Zhejiang and northern Anhui can basically complete land reform by the end of March next year. After completing land distribution, various places will immediately carry out rectification and development of mass organizations such as peasant associations, build militia, and carry out democratic construction, train cadres, and organize mass production; and under the slogan of defending the fruits of liberation, further launch the patriotic movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and defending the homeland.

    华东土地改革顺利进行
    在有准备有经验的基础上已逐步推上“点面结合，全面展开”的新阶段
    【新华社上海十六日电】华东各地土地改革正全面展开。已分配土地的地区，农村出现了新气象。华东军政委员会根据一年来土地改革准备工作的情况、各地群众的迫切要求和目前形势发展的需要，决定华东全区除福建部分地区和皖北重灾区外争取于明年四月前后基本完成土地改革任务。
    今年二月以来，华东各地即遵照军政委员会指示，进行各项有关土地改革的准备工作。中央人民政府土地改革法公布后，华东军政委员会在七月中旬，又通过了华东土地改革实施办法，接着各省各行政区相继举行了各界人民代表会议及农民代表会议，各地中共地方组织也召开了党的代表会议，讨论了土地改革的具体实施办法，各级政府机关和群众团体，都有计划地学习了土地改革法，并通过各种座谈会，讲演会普遍展开了土地改革的宣传教育工作。在这期间，全区按计划整训了十七万六千多土地改革工作干部。这些干部经整训后大大提高了政策思想，整顿了工作作风，现在都已先后下乡。县以上各级土地改革委员会和人民法庭也已相继建立。各地经过剿匪、反霸、减租、合理负担及生产救灾等运动，对农民群众已有初步发动，华东全区农民协会会员已达二千四百万人。
    一千余乡完成土改
    农民说：“贫雇农得地开心，中农有利称心，富农不动定心，地主劳动回心。”
    自七月初开始，各省、区都选择了包括各种类型的乡（村）进行土地改革的典型试验，到九月中旬就有十三个乡完成了土地分配。中共中央华东局就在这时召开了第一次土地改革典型试验工作总结会议。经总结这一阶段的经验后，各地土地改革运动就进入了“典型突破、逐步推跳”（按即首先突破典型乡，然后将运动逐步向其周围地区推广，并将工作重心跳到另一典型乡，再予突破和推广）的第二阶段。到十一月十五日为止，根据各地统计：老区已发土地证结束土地改革的，计山东八千三百四十一个村，苏北二千二百十二个乡。新区已完成土改的共有一千一百八十三个乡。全华东已有十六个县全面展开，有二十一个区已全部完成土地分配。在局部展开中，运动进展是比较顺利的。雇贫农迫切要求土地，分得土地后，普遍表示满意。中农原先有怕多抽佃田等顾虑，经进行阶级教育后，情绪转趋积极。富农原先怀疑保存富农经济是假的，土地改革后定了心，要求参加农会。多数在乡地主已表现低头，部分并已开始参加劳动生产。农民描写土地改革后农村各阶层的情况时说：“雇贫农得地开心，中农有利称心，富农不动定心，地主劳动回心。”已完成了土地改革的乡村，农民觉悟和生产积极性普遍提高，群众组织有发展，并建立和发展了民兵。乡村政权也得到了进一步的改造，文化活动也有开展。
    运动中的缺点：
    镇压地主不够及时，发动群众不够充分；有些干部包办代替，部分地区潦草结束。
    但运动中仍存在若干缺点，首先是镇压地主的破坏不够及时，群众发动得不够充分。各地不法地主反抗和破坏土地改革的行为较普遍，特别是利用美帝国主义侵朝战争，造谣恐吓农民。个别地区甚至有地主打干部，烧房子，杀干部，组织骚动等事发生，经强调镇压后已开始转变。其次，在不同地区，运动中有不同程度的干部包办代替现象；个别地区还有前紧后松，潦革结束的现象。个别地方在执行政策上有提升阶级，排斥中农，依靠雇贫农思想不大明确的现象，个别乡村干部还有多得果实的。十一月中旬，中共中央华东局又召开了第二次土地改革典型试验总结会议，进一步总结了点面结合的经验，批判和纠正了运动中存在的缺点，确定了放手发动群众与大胆展开运动的方针。对于已结束土地改革的农村工作也作了具体的部署。此外，这次会上，皖南区对于山区土地改革中分山的政策问题，提出了比较系统的意见。山东对老区结束土地改革，也提供了比较完整的经验。会议对各地运动在逐步展开中所发现的若干具体问题，都做了解决。
    至此，华东土地改革运动，在有准备有经验的基础上已逐步推上“点面结合，全面展开”的新阶段。依据前一阶段的经验，各地正进一步整顿干部的思想作风，统一干部的认识；并特别强调在运动中深入检查，大胆放手发动群众，以便使运动健全发展。照目前情况估计，除福建部分地区及皖北重灾区外，苏北、苏南、皖南、山东在明年二月底，浙江、皖北在明年三月底，都可基本完成土地改革。各地在完成土地分配后，将立即进行整顿和发展农民协会等群众组织、建设民兵，并行民主建政、训练干部和组织群众生产等工作；并将在保卫翻身果实的口号下，进一步展开抗美援朝、保家卫国的爱国运动。
