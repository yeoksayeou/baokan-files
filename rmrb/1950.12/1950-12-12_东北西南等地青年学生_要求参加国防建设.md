Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th. Youth students in various parts of Northeast China are actively signing up to study at military cadre schools. After the joint decision of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council was announced, thousands of young people enthusiastically expressed their great aspiration to train themselves into strong people's air force, navy, and tank soldiers.

　　At the Northeast Experimental School, 650 students have already signed up to apply for various military cadre schools. Forty students who have been approved and have already arrived at the school jointly wrote a letter to the Northeast Daily, saying that it is the greatest honor in their lives that their aspirations can be realized today. The letter described their happy life in the military school for the past two days, saying: "We have received infinite warmth. The leaders of the school take care of us like kind parents; the comrades are even closer than biological brothers. We have experienced the love of the revolutionary troops for the first time. We have only one belief, which is to bravely take on the glorious task of defending the motherland." At Shenyang No. 5 Middle School, 206 students have signed up to participate in military school studies. The students of No. 10 Middle School carefully studied the application conditions, some patted their chests and said confidently: "It will definitely work." Some worried that their physical condition would not meet the requirements, and went to the sports field every day to exercise.

　　Youth students in Dalian City have shown great patriotic enthusiasm after seeing the decision. The principals' offices, the Communist Party committees, and the Communist Youth League committees of various schools are crowded with groups of students, one after another putting forward their requests. Students in various classes of the Northeast Navigation School urged their class representatives to sign up for them, and asked the school to quickly establish a recommendation committee. Chen Xixiang, the representative of the graduating Class Three, said: "We have learned navigation technology, and all the students in the class are asking to go to the naval school immediately to build a strong navy for the motherland."

　　In Songjiang Province, 50 students from Harbin No. 1 and No. 7 Middle Schools, as well as middle schools in Boli, Bayan, and Mishan counties, have been approved to transfer to military schools. When they left the school, at a farewell meeting for all the students, they said that they must learn military technology well and make contributions on the battlefield in the future.

　　In Jinzhou Normal School, Liaoxi Province, 500 students signed up in half a day. A student from Jinzhou Middle School, He Furong, wrote in his application: "When our beloved motherland is facing the serious situation of the crazy aggression of American imperialism, I am determined to devote myself to building the strong national defense of the motherland. I want to learn from the Soviet air force hero Kozhedub and be a glorious Mao Zedong's Eagle."

[From Our Newspaper] Youth students in the Southwest Region and Xi'an City are enthusiastically requesting to participate in military cadre schools. The youth students of Chongqing City, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, inquired about the registration locations and dates from the Communist Youth League and student unions before the enrollment committee was even established. On the 7th and 8th of this month alone, more than 700 youth students wrote to the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, requesting to participate in military cadre schools. The democratic wall of the Municipal Commercial Vocational School was covered with many big-character posters responding to the call of the motherland. Members of the school's "Joliot-Curie Peace Pioneer Team" and "Kim Il-sung Combat Team" all signed their names on the big-character posters.

　　Schools in various parts of the North Sichuan Region have successively established recommendation committees. Many young people are afraid of failing the examination. In their applications, they repeatedly explained their health conditions and stated their determination to be loyal to the motherland.

　　Major universities and middle schools in Xi'an City have successively held mobilization meetings. The students unanimously expressed that they would inherit the excellent traditions of the "December 1st" and "December 9th" youth students with heroic and firm determination, and actively participate in the glorious posts of patriotic youth. Yang Zheng Lu, the youngest daughter of General Yang Hucheng, who was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a student at Xi'an Girls' Middle School, said: "I want to participate in military school to learn skills and avenge my father and mother who were killed by the US-Chiang bandits!"

    东北西南等地青年学生
    要求参加国防建设
    【新华社沈阳十日电】东北各地青年学生纷纷报名参加军事干部学校学习。当中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院的联合决定发布后，成千的青年们热情地表示了要把自己锻炼成一个坚强的人民空军、海军和坦克手的伟大志愿。
    东北实验学校学生已有六百五十个学生报名投考各种军事干部学校。已获批准并已到学校的四十名学生，联合写信给东北日报说，他们的志愿今日得以实现是有生以来的最大光荣。信中叙述了他们到了军事学校以后两天来的愉快生活说：“我们已得到无限的温暖，学校的首长像慈祥的父母一样地照顾我们；同志们比亲兄弟还亲热，我们第一次接触了革命部队的友爱，我们只有一个信念，就是勇敢地把保卫祖国的光荣任务担负起来。”沈阳市立第五中学报名参加军校学习的学生已有二百零六人。第十中学的学生们仔细地研究了报名的条件，有的拍着胸膛信心十足地说：“一定行。”有的担心身体不合格，天天跑到体育场去锻炼身体。
    旅大市青年学生看到决定后，爱国热情很高。各校校长室、中共党委和青年团委办公室都挤满着成群的学生，一个接着一个提出自己的要求。东北航海学校各班学生纷纷催促班代表去为自己报名，并要求校方迅速成立保送委员会。即将毕业的三班代表陈稀祥说：“我们已学到了航海技术，全班同学都要求马上去参加海军学校为祖国建设强大的海军。”
    松江省哈尔滨第一、第七中学和勃利、巴彦、密山等县中学已有五十名学生被批准转入军事学校学习，他们离校时在全体学生的欢送大会上，表示一定要学好军事技术，将来在战场上立功。
    辽西省锦州师范学校在半天时间内，就有五百名学生报名。锦州中学的一个学生贺福儒在申请书上写道：“当可爱的祖国面临美帝国主义疯狂侵略的严重情势下，我决心投身建设祖国的强大国防，我要向苏联空军英雄阔日杜布学习，作一个光荣的毛泽东之鹰。”
    【本报讯】西南区及西安市青年学生热烈要求参加军事干部学校。有着光荣的反帝斗争传统的重庆市青年学生们，在招生委员会未成立前便已纷纷向青年团和学生会询问报名的地点和日期。仅本月七、八两日即有七百余青年学生投书重庆新华日报，要求参加军事干部学校。市立商业职业学校民主墙上贴满了许多响应祖国号召的大字报，该校“约里奥——居里和平先锋队”、“金日成战斗队”的队员们都在大字报上签了名。
    川北区各地学校均先后成立了保送委员会，许多青年们惟恐检验不上，在他们申请书中反复地说明他们的健康情形，并说明他们效忠祖国的决心。
    西安市各大、中学先后召开了动员大会，学生们一致表示要以英勇坚强的决心，继承“一二一”“一二九”青年学生的优良传统，踊跃参加到爱国青年的光荣岗位上去。被国民党反动派所杀害的杨虎城将军的幼女、西安市女中学生杨拯陆说：“我要参加军事学校学习本领，替被美蒋匪帮杀害的爸爸、妈妈报仇！”
