Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 15th: Another group of 691 overseas Chinese, expelled by the British colonial government in Malaya, arrived in Shantou by ship on the 11th. Representatives from the local People's Government, the South Seas Returned Overseas Chinese Association, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, the Overseas Chinese Middle School, and various people's organizations boarded the ship to express their condolences.

　　This group of compatriots in distress was deported from eight concentration camps in Pulau Jerejak of Penang, Ipoh of Perak, Kluang of Johor, and Johor Bahru by the British colonialists. Most of them were rubber tappers who had worked in Malaya for many years. Their blood and sweat created wealth for British capitalists. However, the British colonialists arrested, tortured, and expelled them arbitrarily and unreasonably. When they were expelled back to China this time, they had no clothes or bedding, only broken burlap sacks covering their ravaged bodies.

　　After landing, these compatriots in distress all accused the British imperialists of their brutal atrocities with immense anger. They personally experienced all kinds of tortures by the British imperialists in the concentration camps, including waterboarding (which the beasts called "drinking oriental wine"), pouring chili juice, burning with fire, exposure to the sun, electric shocks, pulling out fingernails with iron pliers, stabbing or cutting women's nipples with needles or knives, and other unimaginable tortures. Zeng Guipeng, a disabled female worker who was severely beaten, said that another female worker, Ya Mian, who was interrogated with her, was beaten so badly that she could not make a sound. When the British police continued to force her to answer, they inserted a pen into her throat as soon as she opened her mouth. Another young peasant woman was stripped naked, and the British police used iron pliers to crush her nipples, and then stabbed her breasts with needles. Zhong Tianzhi, a distressed overseas Chinese, said that after he was arrested by the British detective department, six bestial soldiers took turns torturing him all night, and then soaked his whole body in cold water, tied his hands and feet, and hung him outside to be blown by the wind and bitten by mosquitoes for eight days and nights.

　　When these forcibly repatriated overseas Chinese learned about the message of sympathy from He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and the news of the rally of returned overseas Chinese in Beijing protesting against the British imperialists' persecution of overseas Chinese, they all expressed their gratitude for the concern of the motherland and unanimously expressed their firm support for the struggle for the right of residence and the right to survival of the 2.8 million overseas Chinese in Malaya.

    马来亚英殖民当局继续迫害我国侨胞            
    又一批被逐侨胞抵汕头
    【新华社广州十五日电】又一批被马来亚英殖民政府驱逐出境的侨胞六百九十一人，于十一日乘轮抵汕头。当地人民政府、南洋归侨联谊会、侨务局、华侨中学和各人民团体，均派代表登轮慰问。
    这批难胞是英国殖民者从槟榔屿木寇山、霹雳州怡保、柔佛州居銮和新山等地八个集中营中押解驱逐出境的。他们大多数是曾在马来亚多年的割胶工人。他们的血汗做成了英国资本家的财富。但英国殖民者却横蛮无理地拘捕、拷打与驱逐他们。他们这次被逐回国时，没有衣服，没有铺盖，只是在被残害的身上，披着一块破麻袋。
    这些难胞们在登岸后，均以无限的愤怒控诉英帝国主义的凶残暴行。他们在集中营里曾亲身经受了英帝国主义者各种各样的毒刑，其中包括灌水（野兽们称之为“喝东洋酒”）、灌辣椒汁、火烙、晒太阳、电刑、铁钳拔指甲、针刺或刀割妇女乳头和其他难以想像的刑罚。被毒打成了残废的女工曾桂蓬说：跟她本人一起受审讯的女工亚勉，被毒打到不能发出声音。英国警察继续逼她答话，等她一张嘴，便用钢笔插进她的喉咙。另外一个青年农妇被脱光衣服，英国警察用铁钳把她的乳头夹烂，然后用针刺她的乳房。难侨钟天之说：他被抓进英国侦探部后，由六个兽兵轮流施刑，拷问通宵，然后用冷水浸透全身，绑着他的双手双脚，吊在屋外，让他被风吹和蚊咬，一连八昼夜。
    当这些被迫归国的侨胞获悉中央人民政府华侨事务委员会何香凝主任委员的慰问电及北京归国华侨集会抗议英帝国主义迫害华侨暴行的消息时，他们都对祖国的关怀，表示感谢，并一致表示坚决支持为马来亚二百八十万华侨的居留权利和生存权利而斗争。
