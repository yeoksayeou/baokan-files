Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 25th Tass: The Free German Youth League will hold its first all-German representative meeting in Berlin on November 26th to discuss the work achievements already obtained and plan for future work.

Under the initiative of the League, the "German Youth Peace Movement" was launched nationwide in Germany from June 1st to November 15th. The League members have completed a lot of work, explaining to the people that they must engage in active struggle to defend peace. Now tens of thousands of peace-loving members of the Free German Youth League have collected 8.7 million signatures on the Stockholm Appeal in the towns and villages of the German Democratic Republic and in West Germany. Before the people's elections in the German Democratic Republic, hundreds of thousands of young peace fighters had extensively conducted propaganda among the voters.

The Free German Youth League has more than 1.5 million members, who are actively fighting for the unity of the country in the ranks of the National Front of Democratic Germany. Nearly 130,000 representatives of the Free German Youth League are members of the National Front Committee. The proposals of the Eight Foreign Ministers' Conference in Prague have inspired new forces for the youth to fight for peace and the unity of Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 28th Tass: The first all-German representative meeting of the Free German Youth League passed a resolution on November 26th to send a telegram of respect to Stalin, the leader of peace-loving humanity; at that time, the venue was filled with deafening and lasting cheers.

The meeting warmly endorsed a proposal to send a telegram of respect to the Leninist-Stalinist Communist Youth League, which has become a model for young people all over the world in the struggle to defend peace. It also passed a resolution on launching a movement to promote science and culture in Germany.
