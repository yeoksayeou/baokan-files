Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 6th (TASS): The defense lawyers of the eleven American Communist leaders convicted by the American court have submitted a defense statement to the U.S. Supreme Court to support their appeal. The lawyers strongly attacked the Smith Act, according to which the eleven U.S. Communist leaders were convicted, as illegal. They emphasized that the Communist Party leaders advocate peace.

Prior to the start of the Supreme Court hearing, Hall, the secretary of the National Committee of the U.S. Communist Party, made a brief statement to reporters, saying that the case now to be heard by the Supreme Court is related to MacArthur's policy of so-called preventive war, which the Communist Party is vehemently opposed to; this case is also related to the theory of "preventive arrest," according to which the U.S. government is trying to imprison all those who demand peace or may demand peace in the future. Hall emphasized that the people want peace and democracy. The U.S. Communist leaders are being prosecuted under the Smith Act for the sole reason that they are fighting for peace, that they are exercising their constitutional rights of freedom of speech, publication, and assembly.

    美共书记霍尔发表声明指出
    美最高法院审理美共领袖与麦克阿瑟叫嚣战争有关
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社华盛顿六日讯：被美国法院判罪的十一位美国共产党领袖的辩护律师，向美国最高法院提出了支持他们上诉的辩诉状。律师们强烈攻击那个据以将十一位美共领袖判罪的史密斯法是非法的。他们着重指出：共产党的领袖们是主张和平的。
    在最高法院听审开始前，美共全国委员会书记霍尔对新闻记者发表简短声明称：现在最高法院要审理的这个案件，与麦克阿瑟关于所谓预防性战争的政策有关，而这个政策正是共产党所激烈反对的；这个案件也与“预防性逮捕”的理论有关，美国政府正是根据这个理论力图监禁所有要求和平或者将来可能要求和平的人们。霍尔着重指出：人民要和平，要民主。美共领袖正在受到根据史密斯法的控告，唯一的原因就是他们为和平而斗争，就是他们运用言论、出版与集会自由的宪法权利。
