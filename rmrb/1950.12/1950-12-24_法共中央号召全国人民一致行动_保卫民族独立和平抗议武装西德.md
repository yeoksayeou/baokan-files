Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 20th: According to TASS, *L'Humanité* published a statement from the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, entitled "All French People Unite and Act Together to Save Peace." The statement said: "The conspirators of the Atlantic Pact held a meeting in Brussels at the behest of the American Acheson. The resolutions of this meeting inevitably aroused the anger of all French people and peace defenders around the world. These conspirators decided to unify their armies and place this army under the command of an American general. They decided to expand military production under the unified leadership of the United States. They expressed agreement on "Germany's contribution to common defense," that is, on the issue of arming Germany. They approved the establishment of German air force formations as auxiliaries to the new defense forces.
The statement pointed out: These resolutions aim to accelerate the preparation for war, undermine the Four-Power Conference proposed by the Soviet Union to resolve the German question and the demilitarization of Germany, and eliminate the last vestige of French independence. "The French army and the French economy, already controlled by American imperialism, are now formally placed under the control of the American imperialist authorities, while at the same time the German army is being revived on our borders."
The statement called: "French men and women! Regardless of political views and religious beliefs, unite to oppose the arming of Germany for national independence and peace. In all factories, cities, and villages, express the common will of the people to save peace in various ways – strikes, petitions, declarations, resolutions! Shatter the plans of the government that betrays the nation, and strive to establish a government of the French and implement a policy of the French. It is not too late to do so now."
The statement finally emphasized: "As long as the French people are united in good faith, they will have enough strength to guarantee the victory of the great cause of peace together with the people of the world."

    法共中央号召全国人民一致行动  保卫民族独立和平抗议武装西德
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十日讯：《人道报》发表法国共产党中央委员会的声明，题为“全体法国人民团结起来，一致行动，拯救和平”。声明称：“大西洋公约的阴谋家们奉美国艾奇逊之命在布鲁塞尔举行了会议。该会的决议无法避免地引起了全体法国人民以及全世界的和平保卫者的愤怒。这些阴谋家们决定统一他们的军队并把这支军队置于美国将军的统率之下。他们决定在美国的统一领导之下扩大军事生产。他们在“德国对共同防务的贡献”，即是说在武装德国问题上表示意见一致。他们赞同建立德国空军编队作为新国防军部队的辅助。
    声明指出：这些决议目的在于加速准备战争，破坏苏联为了解决德国问题和德国非军国主义化问题而建议召开的四强会议，在于消灭法国最后残存的一点独立性。“已受美国帝国主义控制的法国军队和法国经济，现在正式地交由美帝国主义当局支配，而同时德国军队却在我们的边界上复活起来了。”
    声明号召：“法国男女同胞们！不分政见和宗教信仰，一致起来，为了民族独立与和平，反对武装德国。在一切工厂、城市、乡村，用各种不同的方式——停工，请愿，宣言，决议——来表示全国人民拯救和平的共同意志！粉碎背叛民族的政府的计划，争取建立法国人的政府并执行法国人的政策，现在为时尚不为晚。”
    声明最后强调：“只要法国人民精诚团结，就有足够的力量和全世界人民一起保证和平伟业的胜利。”
