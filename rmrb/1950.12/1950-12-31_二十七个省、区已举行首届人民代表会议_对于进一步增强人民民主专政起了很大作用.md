    Based on the widespread holding of people's representative conferences at the city and county levels across the country, twenty provinces and seven administrative regions equivalent to provinces have successively convened their first people's representative conferences. The widespread convening of provincial (regional) people's representative conferences across the country has played a significant role in further consolidating the people's democratic united front in order to further strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship. The provinces (regions) that have held people's representative conferences are: Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Liaodong, Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shandong, Hubei, Henan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and seven administrative regions: Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Northern Anhui, Western Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan. Among these, the people's representative conferences of the first sixteen provinces, including Hebei, elected the people's government committees of their respective provinces. The people's representative conferences of each province (region) also elected and established consultative committees to assist the government in implementing the various resolutions of the conference after its closing.
    Local conferences all listened to, discussed, and approved the work reports and financial revenue and expenditure reports made by the persons in charge of the provincial people's governments or people's administrative offices at the conferences. Based on the specific circumstances and conditions of the local areas, they also proposed, discussed, and approved the administrative policies of the entire province (region). In the provinces of North and Northeast China that have completed land reform, the focus of the conferences was generally on discussing how to increase production. The people's representative conferences in the provinces and regions of East and Central South China discussed the issue of starting or completing land reform this winter and next spring. The conferences in Qinghai, Ningxia, and other provinces focused on discussing further strengthening national unity, eliminating bandits and special agents, and restoring and developing production. The people's representative conferences in the three administrative regions of Western Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan all decided that the central task of their respective regions this winter and next spring would be to continue eliminating bandits, launch anti-despot and rent reduction movements.
    Through detailed discussions at the conferences, the work plans and administrative policies of the people's governments of each province (region) have become more complete and substantial. At the same time, this has greatly strengthened the determination and confidence of the people of each province (region) to complete their work tasks.
    The atmosphere at the local conferences was full of democratic discussion and cooperation. The opinions and proposals of the representatives were resolved and handled. Different opinions were repeatedly discussed democratically until consensus was reached, greatly facilitating the development of work in each province (region). When Shanxi Province held its first people's representative conference in March of this year, some representatives' original proposals and opinions were that prices should be stable and burdens should be reduced; some representatives of organs even requested increased expenditures. After repeated discussions on the overall budget for annual financial revenue and expenditure, not only did the representatives of the organs automatically withdraw their requests to increase funding and expand staffing, but the representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors also automatically withdrew their proposals to reduce tax rates. Everyone unanimously recognized that the financial policy of the people's government was derived from the people and used for the people, recognized the difficulties in realizing the province's financial budget, and discussed ways to overcome these difficulties.
    The results of the conferences held in various places prove that the provincial (regional) people's representative conferences are a good democratic system that concentrates the opinions of the people of the entire province (region), persists in them, and transforms them into the common will and action of the masses of people of all strata. However, because the provincial (regional) people's representative conferences cover a wider area, they mainly discuss the work policies for the entire province for one year, and cannot discuss work as specifically as the city and county people's representative conferences; therefore, how to combine the problems of the entire province (region) with individual problems through the conference, so that the activities of all sectors of the people in the entire province (region) can be closely centered around the central task, still needs to be further strengthened in the future.

    二十七个省、区已举行首届人民代表会议
    对于进一步增强人民民主专政起了很大作用
    【新华社三十日讯】在全国各市、县普遍举行了各界人民代表会议的基础上，全国已有二十个省和七个相当于省的行政区先后召开了首届各界人民代表会议。全国省（区）的各界人民代表会议的普遍召开，对于进一步巩固人民民主统一战线以便进一步增强人民民主专政是起了很大的作用。在全国已举行省（区）各界人民代表会议的有：河北、山西、察哈尔、辽东、吉林、松江、黑龙江、热河、山东、湖北、河南、江西、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海、湖南、广东、广西、浙江等二十个省和苏南、苏北、皖南、皖北、川西、川南、川北等七个行政区。其中，河北等前十六个省的各界人民代表会议，并选举了各该省人民政府委员会。各省（区）的各界人民代表会议并选举和成立了协商委员会，在会议闭幕后协助政府执行会议的各项决议。
    各地会议都听取、讨论和通过了省人民政府或人民行政公署负责人在会议上所作的工作报告和财政收支报告。并根据当地的具体情况和条件，提出、讨论和通过了全省（区）的施政方针。华北、东北已完成土地改革的各省，会议中心一般是讨论如何增加生产的问题。华东、中南各省、区的各界人民代表会议，则分别讨论了在今冬明春开始进行土地改革或完成土地改革的问题。青海、宁夏等省的会议着重讨论了进一步加强民族团结、肃清土匪特务与恢复和发展生产等问题。川西、川南、川北等三个行政区的各界人民代表会议，都决定各该区今冬明春的中心工作是继续肃清土匪、展开反恶霸和减租运动。
    经过会议的详细讨论，各省（区）人民政府的工作计划和施政方针是更完备和更充实了。同时，这也大大地加强了各省（区）人民对完成工作任务的决心和信心。
    各地会议上充满了民主讨论和团结合作的气氛。代表们的意见和提案都得到了解决和处理。不同的意见经过反复的民主的讨论后，取得了一致，大大便利于各该省（区）工作的开展。今年三月山西省举行首届各界人民代表会议时，若干代表原来的提案和意见是既要物价稳定，又要减少负担；有的机关代表并要求增加开支。及至反复讨论了全年财政收支概算后，不仅机关代表自动撤回了增加经费、扩大编制的要求，工商界代表也自动撤销了减轻税额的提案，并且大家一致认识到了人民政府的财政政策是取之于民、用之于民，认识到了实现全省财政概算的困难，同时，并讨论了克服困难的办法。
    各地举行会议的结果证明：省（区）各界人民代表会议是把全省（区）人民的意见集中起来然后坚持下去，变为各阶层人民群众的共同意志和行动的良好民主制度。但是，省（区）各界人民代表会议由于包括地区较广，主要是讨论全省一年的工作方针，不能像市、县各界人民代表会议讨论工作那样具体；因此，如何通过会议把全省（区）的问题与个别问题很好地结合起来，使全省（区）各界人民的活动都能紧密地围绕着中心任务，还有待于今后进一步加强。
