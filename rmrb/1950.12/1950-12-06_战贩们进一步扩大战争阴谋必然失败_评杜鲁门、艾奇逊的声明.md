    The so-called "general offensive to end the Korean War" launched by the American invading forces on November 24th has been thoroughly crushed by the heroic and powerful counterattacks of the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteers Against U.S. Aggression. The U.S. imperialists brazenly rejected the suggestion of a "peaceful resolution to the Korean issue," and recklessly launched this gamble-like offensive, concentrating all their invading forces in Korea, originally fantasizing about realizing their wild plan to swiftly annex the entire Korean peninsula, further invade China, and dominate Asia. However, in less than a week, this wild and adventurous plan has completely gone bankrupt. Following the U.S. imperialists and jointly participating in the war of aggression against Korea, the imperialist accomplices originally fantasized that their aggressive leaders might swiftly extinguish the just flames of resistance against aggression by the Chinese and Korean people in this general offensive, and then withdraw the forces trapped in the Korean battlefield to strengthen the Western aggressive front. But in less than a week, this illusory bubble has also been completely shattered. The originally arrogant American war-mongers, after suffering this serious setback, are obviously beside themselves with rage. The British and French aggressive partners, who originally fantasized that the United States could achieve a quick victory, after their illusions were shattered, are obviously trapped in an unprecedented atmosphere of panic and mutual recrimination.
    Under these circumstances, U.S. President Truman hurriedly issued a statement "Regarding the Korean Situation" on November 30th, and immediately followed it with a message to Congress on December 1st requesting additional military appropriations. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson also delivered a lengthy speech on November 29th entitled "The Strategy of Freedom." These statements and speeches, on the one hand, reflect the grief and anxiety of the American war-mongers over the serious setbacks suffered in the war of aggression against Korea, and on the other hand, expose the war-mongers' conspiracy to further expand the war of aggression.
    In the face of another great victory of the Chinese and Korean people against American aggression, Truman has foreseen the danger of his aggressive plan being "defeated" in its entirety. He said: "The recent developments in the Korean situation have put the world (should be read as the American ruling group) in a serious crisis... We may fail again as before." However, this frantic cry does not mean that the American war-mongers will therefore stop or slow down the pace of their war of aggression. On the contrary, it precisely indicates that they intend to use this "serious crisis" to stimulate war mobilization in the United States and its vassal states. In his message to Congress, Truman declared: "Faced with this situation, the United States and other countries have no other option but to very rapidly strengthen their military forces... Since we have firmly and definitively made this choice, we are determined not to flinch, hesitate, or abandon it halfway." Acheson similarly claimed in his "Strategy of Freedom" speech: "The course of action we have chosen is to work with our allies to build the strength of the free world (should be read as the American aggressive bloc) as a bulwark against Soviet aggression(?)." From this, people can see that the American war-mongers, although suffering another serious setback in the war of aggression against Korea, still have no remorse. They not only do not give up their ambition to annex Korea and invade China, but also decide to step up the enhancement of their aggressive military strength in order to further expand the war. This is the American authorities' "future course of action."
    In order to realize this overall conspiracy to further expand the war of aggression, Truman and Acheson specifically put forward the following three measures:
    First, to establish the so-called "international order" of American world domination "under the United Nations." Acheson openly pointed out that the United Nations organization is "a means" through which the United States "can take practical, day-to-day steps to build a solid international family." What is the specific content of the so-called "international family" or "international order"? Truman and Acheson did not say it explicitly on this issue, but they have already made some examples of "establishing international order" "under the United Nations." The bloody and tragic situation created by the United States in Korea through large-scale bombing, massacre, destruction, and plunder is a typical example of this "international family" or "international order." The armed occupation of Taiwan by the United States is another example of this "international family" or "international order." The U.S. monopoly of Japan is yet another example of this "international family" or "international order." People can see from these examples that the "international order" that the United States wants to establish, if not according to American-style deceitful words, but to tell the truth, is that all the nations of the world should live under the enslavement of U.S. imperialism. This "international order" is nothing more than a replica of Hitler's "Greater Germanic Reich" and Tojo's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," etc. But neither Hitler's nor Tojo's aggressive ambitions can compare to today's Truman. The "Greater Germanic Reich" that Hitler dreamed of establishing but ultimately collapsed was limited to the European continent. The "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" that Tojo fantasized about realizing but ultimately failed was also limited to the East. But Truman, who followed in the footsteps of Hitler and Tojo, raved that he wanted to establish an "international order" of American world domination "under the United Nations." Not long ago, the United States, relying on the voting machine it manipulated, had the United Nations pass the so-called "United Action for Peace" resolution that undermined the principle of great power unanimity and the authority of the Security Council; recently, when the United Nations Security Council discussed the "accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan," it again, due to U.S. manipulation, refused to pass the three peace proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation and our special representative. On the other hand, it plans to re-submit the so-called "six-nation proposal," which has already been vetoed by the Soviet Union in the Security Council, to the United Nations General Assembly, attempting to use this to obstruct our people's volunteer support for Korea's just cause, and to conspire to create a new excuse for annexing Korea, invading China, and expanding the war. All these facts show that the American war-mongers are not only plotting to "establish international order under the United Nations," but are actually actively carrying out this conspiracy. The development of this American conspiracy should attract the close attention of the people of all countries in the world.
    Secondly, the war-mongers proposed to "develop regional groupings," to take "cooperative defense (should be read as aggressive) measures" (see Acheson's speech), to "increase the combined strength of all free nations (should be read as aggressive nations) at a very rapid rate," and to "immediately establish a unified European army under a supreme command" (see Truman's statement). In other words, this is to rapidly strengthen the aggressive alliance headed by the United States, and the aggressive allied forces under American unified command, to strengthen the strength of aggressive blocs such as the Atlantic Treaty and the Pacific Treaty, in preparation for a "world-scale" war of aggression. This American measure means that its control over some vassal states will be further tightened. It is desperately trying to drag its aggressive partners who follow it onto that American war chariot that attempts to rush around the world but lacks power. Although this war chariot is so dilapidated that it cannot withstand the turbulent waves of the world's people's democratic forces, and although there are various contradictions between the American master and its accomplices, the American war-monger lords are still determined to drive this dilapidated war chariot and forcibly drag its accomplices onto it to rampage barbarously across the globe. This trend is already clearly revealed in Truman's and Acheson's statements.
    Third, the war-mongers repeatedly emphasized the need to rapidly expand the strength of American aggression. They claimed: "The defense efforts (should be read as mobilization for the war of aggression) of the United States and other free countries are insufficient, and all free countries need to greatly increase the scale and speed of their defense efforts (i.e., war mobilization)." (See Acheson's speech.) To this end, Truman submitted a message to Congress on December 1st, requesting another large appropriation of military expenses "to meet the need for action that may occur anywhere in the world." This additional military expenditure includes an additional budget of 16.8 billion U.S. dollars for the Department of Defense for the 1951 fiscal year, as well as 1.05 billion U.S. dollars for expanding the production of atomic weapons. After this additional appropriation, the direct military expenditure of the U.S. Department of Defense totals a huge amount of 41.8 billion U.S. dollars. If we add more than 5 billion U.S. dollars in so-called "military aid" appropriations and approximately 2 billion U.S. dollars in atomic weapons appropriations, the total amount of U.S. military expenditure for this year will be nearly 50 billion U.S. dollars, more than twice the military expenditure of the first year of the United States' participation in World War II. Truman also emphasized that these military appropriations "must be approved for use quickly in order to build up our military strength as quickly as possible." Truman openly announced that the United States' war mobilization, both in "manpower and production, has to raise our goals." He called for "immediately starting to rapidly increase the size of the armed forces and the efficiency of military training," and demanded that "the immediate rapid increase in the production rate of aircraft, tanks, and other military equipment" to enable the United States to "rapidly enter a high state of mobilization."
    The above three contents are Truman's proposed measures to "cope with the new situation" - that is, the basic points of Acheson's so-called "strategy of freedom." All of these measures are obviously serving the United States' world expansion policy and world war policy. This is the war-mongers' conspiracy to further expand the war.
    In order to cover up this sinister conspiracy, Truman and Acheson even slandered the just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against American aggression as "aggression," and clamored that "this is part of the international communist movement's global activities," saying that it "seriously threatens the security of the free world." The American reactionaries thought that as long as they said this, they could make people believe that they have reason to annex Korea and further invade China, that they have reason to mobilize the American people to serve as cannon fodder for Wall Street's monopoly capitalists for foreign aggression, and that they have reason to mobilize their vassal states to serve as sacrifices for the United States' world expansion policy. Isn't this calculation very satisfactory? But the problem is that the American reactionaries' slander against China is completely unreasonable. The people of the world will never imagine that the Chinese people's voluntary action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend their homes and country can be called "aggression" and "intervention," while the violent action of the American army crossing the Pacific Ocean with a large number of killing weapons to interfere in the Korean civil war, brutally slaughter the Korean people, and attempt to conquer the entire Korean peninsula can instead not be called "aggression" and "intervention." Moreover, the American people and the people of the world have the experience of World War II. The people of all countries know that Hitler and his aggressive partner, the Japanese militarists, used the slogan of "opposing the communist threat" as a pretext for annexing many nations and invading the whole world. The American reactionaries want to pick up this stinking anti-communist banner that Hitler had already used rottenly to cover up their aggressive purpose of intensifying preparations for war is obviously a futile effort.
    Looking at the American war-mongers' conspiracy to further expand the war, what conclusions should we draw? This is that although the American aggressors have suffered a serious blow on the Korean battlefield, they have not therefore stopped or changed their aggressive policy. On the contrary, after suffering defeat, they are even more arrogantly intensifying war mobilization and stepping up preparations to expand the war. Therefore, all peace-loving countries and people in the world must continue to strengthen the peace movement against U.S. aggression and must further stop the American war conspiracy. This is the only way to improve the international situation. It would be a very serious mistake if someone neglects the enemy's conspiracy to prepare for expanding the war because of the victory on the Korean front, or becomes paralyzed by credulously believing the enemy's political deception. We must more vigorously build our national defense strength, accelerate the growth of our army, navy, and air force. We must carry out national defense economic construction in a more planned way, and launch the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea on a larger scale, more deeply, and more persistently. Continue to give the enemy blows, blows, and more blows, and advance victoriously on the basis of victorious advance. Only the strength of the people's democratic forces, only constantly giving the aggressors major blows, can force the enemy to withdraw its aggressive bloody hand. Under the conditions of the world's people working so hard to strive for peace, it is still possible to overcome the crisis of a new war; and if the mad aggressors insist on provoking a new world war, the people of the world are also fully confident in overthrowing the aggressors and overthrowing the imperialist rule that produces the aggressors.
    We are determined to continue to work tirelessly for peace. No matter how arrogantly the American reactionaries want to expand the war, the fate of the aggressors is inevitably doomed to failure. Because what determines the course of history is by no means the subjective intentions of the American war-mongers, but the strength of the people of the world. After World War II, the newly emerging People's Republic of China formed a treaty of friendship, alliance and mutual assistance with the immensely powerful Soviet Union. This momentous event has brought about a fundamental change in the balance of power between the two major camps in the world. The strength of the world peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union and with the participation of the new China, is developing and growing rapidly. This people's force that defends peace is invincible in the world. The war-mongers who are delirious in their new war frenzy always neglect or are unwilling to acknowledge this major new change that has a decisive effect on the future course of world history. Therefore, they often disregard or underestimate the strength and will of the people, and blindly fantasize about realizing their impossible aggressive adventure plan. This has doomed them to an inevitable end of failure. This is the basic weakness of the American war-mongers' conspiracy to further expand the war. The more frenzied the aggressors are, the more miserable their defeat will be. This is a truth that objective historical development has repeatedly proven.

    战贩们进一步扩大战争阴谋必然失败
    ——评杜鲁门、艾奇逊的声明
    美国侵略军于十一月二十四日发动的所谓“结束朝鲜战争”的总攻势，已经在朝鲜人民军及我抗美援朝志愿部队的英勇而强大的反击之下，彻底被粉碎了。美帝国主义者悍然拒绝了“和平解决朝鲜问题”的建议，而集结其在朝鲜的所有侵略部队，冒然发动这次赌博式的进攻，原来是幻想实现其迅速并吞整个朝鲜、进一步侵略中国、独霸亚洲的狂妄计划。但不出一周，这狂妄的冒险计划，已全部破产了。追随美帝国主义之后，合伙参与侵朝战争的帝国主义帮凶们，原来也幻想他们的侵略首脑可能在这次总攻势中，迅速扑灭中朝人民反抗侵略的正义烈火，而后抽出陷在朝鲜战场的兵力，以加强西方的侵略阵线。但不出一周，这个幻想的泡影，也已完全破灭了。原来趾高气扬的美国战争贩子们，当其遭受这个严重的挫败之后，显然已恼怒得不能自持了。原来幻想美国可以速胜的英法侵略伙伴们，当其幻想破灭之后，显然也已陷于空前的惊慌与互相埋怨的沉重气氛里了。
    在这种形势之下，美国总统杜鲁门急急忙忙于十一月三十日发表了“关于朝鲜局势”的声明，紧接着又在本月一日发表为追加军事拨款致国会的咨文。同时，美国国务卿艾奇逊于十一月二十九日也发表了所谓“自由战略”的长篇演说。这些声明与演说，一方面反映了美国战贩们对于侵朝战争遭受严重挫败的悲哀与忧虑，另一方面，则暴露了战贩们进一步扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
    杜鲁门在中朝人民反对美国侵略的又一次伟大胜利面前，已预感它的侵略计划将有全盘“遭到失败”的危险。他说：“朝鲜局势的最近发展，使世界（应读作美国统治集团）面临严重的危机，………我们可能又像以前一样，遭到失败。”但是，这种惊慌的狂叫，并不是意味着美国战贩们将因此而停止或缓和其侵略战争的步调，恰巧相反，这正表示他们企图以这种“严重的危机”来刺激美国国内及其附庸国家的战争动员。杜鲁门在其给国会的咨文中宣称：“面对这种局势，美国和其他国家没有别的办法，只有很迅速地加强它们的军事力量。………我们既然坚决地和确定地作了这种扶择，我们就决心不畏缩犹疑或中途废止。”艾奇逊在其“自由战略”的演说中亦同样声称：“我们已经选择的行动方针，就是和我们的盟友共同建立自由世界（应读作美国侵略集团）的力量，作为对抗苏联的侵略（？）的堡垒”。人们从此可以看到：美国的战争贩子们，虽然在侵略朝鲜的战争中，又一次遭受严重的挫败，但仍是毫无悔祸之心。它不仅不放弃其吞并朝鲜与侵略中国的野心，而且决定要加紧增强其侵略的军事力量，以便进一步扩大战争。这就是美国当局的“今后行动方针”。
    为了实现这个进一步扩大侵略战争的总阴谋，杜鲁门及艾奇逊特别提出了下面三项办法：
    首先，是“在联合国之下”确立美国统治世界的所谓“国际秩序”。艾奇逊公开指出：联合国组织是“一个手段”，美国通过这个手段，“能够采取实际的、逐日的步骤，来建立一个稳固的国际大家庭”。所谓“国际大家庭”或“国际秩序”的具体内容究竟是怎样呢？关于这个问题，杜鲁门与艾奇逊都没有说穿，但他们却早已“在联合国之下”做出了“确立国际秩序”的若干实例。美国在朝鲜以大规模的轰炸、屠杀与破坏、掠夺所造成的血腥悲惨的情况，就是这种“国际大家庭”或“国际秩序”的一个典型例子。美国对台湾的武装侵占，是这种“国际大家庭”或“国际秩序”的又一个例子。美国对日本的独占，是这种“国际大家庭”或“国际秩序”的再一个例子。人们从这些实例中可以看到：美国所要确立的“国际秩序”，如果不是按照美国式的骗词，而用老实话来说，那就是要全世界各民族均在美帝国主义的奴役之下生活。这种“国际秩序”，实不过是希特勒的“日耳曼大帝国”，与东条的“东亚共荣圈”等等侵略老调的翻版而已。但无论希特勒或东条的侵略野心，却都比不上今日的杜鲁门。希特勒所梦想建立而结果是崩溃的“日耳曼大帝国”，只限于欧洲大陆。东条所幻想实现而结果是失败的“东亚共荣圈”，也只是限于东方。但步随希特勒及东条后尘的杜鲁门，却狂言要“在联合国之下”确立美国统治世界的“国际秩序”了。在不久以前，美国凭其所操纵的表决机器，使联合国通过了破坏大国一致原则及安理会职权的所谓“保障和平的联合行动案”；最近，联合国安理会在讨论“控诉武装侵略台湾案”时，又由于美国的操纵，拒绝通过苏联代表团及我国特派代表所提出的三项和平建议，而另一方面，又策划把业已在安理会上为苏联所否决了的所谓“六国提案”，重新提到联合国大会上，企图以此阻挠我国人民志愿援朝的义举，并阴谋制造吞并朝鲜侵略中国及扩大战争的一个新的借口。所有这一切事实，都表明了美国战贩们不仅阴谋“在联合国之下确立国际秩序”，而且实际上已在积极进行这个阴谋了。美国此项阴谋的发展，应该引起世界各国人民的密切注意。
    其次，战贩们提出要“发展区域的组合”，要采取“合作的防御（应读作侵略）措施”（见艾奇逊演说），要以“一个非常迅速的速率来增加各自由国家（应读作侵略国家）的联合力量”，要“马上建立一支最高司令部指挥下的欧洲统一军队”（见杜鲁门声明）。换句话说，这就是要迅速加强以美国为首的侵略同盟，及在美国统一指挥下的侵略联军，加强如像大西洋公约、太平洋公约等类侵略集团的力量，以准备“世界规模”的侵略战争。美国这项办法，意味着它对若干附庸国家的控制将进一步加紧起来。它拚命地要把追随它的侵略伙伴，都拖上那辆企图急驶全球而又缺乏动力的美式战车。尽管这辆战车已是如此残破不堪，经不起世界人民民主力量风浪的激荡，尽管美国主子与其帮凶们之间充满着各种矛盾，但美国的战贩老爷们，仍决心要驾驶这辆残破战车，并硬拖上它的帮凶们，横蛮地冲撞全球。这一个趋势，从杜鲁门、艾奇逊的声明中，实已昭然若揭了。
    其三，战贩们反复强调要迅速扩充美国侵略的实力。他们声称：“美国及其他自由国家的防务努力（应读作侵略战争的动员）是不充分的，一切自由国家方面都需要大大地增加他们防务努力（即战争动员）的规模与速度。”（见艾奇逊演说）为此，杜鲁门于本月一日向国会提出咨文，要求再一次增拨大批的军事费用，“以应付一旦在世界任何地方发生的行动的必要”。这次增拨的军费，包括国防部一九五一会计年度追加预算一百六十八亿美元，以及用于扩大原子武器生产的十亿零五千万美元。美国国防部直接军事费经过这次增拨之后，合计已达四百一十八亿美元的庞大数目，如果再加上五十余亿美元的所谓“军援”拨款和约近二十亿美元的原子武器拨款，则本年度美国军事费用总额将近五百亿美元，为美国参加第二次世界大战的第一年度军费的二倍以上。杜鲁门并强调这些军事拨款“必须赶快准予动用，以便尽可能迅速地把我们的军事力量建立起来”。杜鲁门公开宣布：美国的战争动员，不论在“人力或生产方面，都有不得不提高我们的目标的必要”。他要求“立即开始迅速增加武装部队的规模和军事训练的效率”，要求“立即开始迅速提高飞机、坦克和其他军事装备的生产率”，借以使美国“迅速进入一个高度的动员状态中”。
    上述三个内容，就是杜鲁门提出“应付新局势”的办法——也就是艾奇逊所谓“自由战略”的基本要点。这一切办法，显然都是为美国的世界扩张政策及世界战争政策而服务的，这是战贩们进一步扩大战争的阴谋。
    为了掩饰这一罪恶的阴谋，杜鲁门及艾奇逊竟然把中朝人民反抗美国侵略的正义斗争，诬蔑为“侵略”，并叫嚣“这是国际共产主义运动的世界性活动的一部分”，说它“严重威胁着自由世界的安全”。美国反动派以为只要这样一说，就可以使人相信他们有理由吞并朝鲜和进一步侵略中国了，就有理由可以动员美国人民为华尔街的垄断资本家充当对外侵略的炮灰了，就有理由可以动员其附庸国家充当美国世界扩张政策的牺牲品了。这个算盘岂不是打的十分如意吗？但问题是在于美国反动派对中国的诬蔑是完全没有道理的，世界人民决不可能想像中国人民因反对侵略和干涉而进行的抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿行动可以称为“侵略”和“干涉”，而美国军队挟大量杀人武器横渡太平洋来干涉朝鲜内战、惨杀朝鲜人民、妄图征服全朝鲜的狂暴行动反倒可以不称为“侵略”和“干涉”。而且美国人民和全世界人民都有了二次世界大战的经验。世界各国的人民知道：希特勒及其侵略伙伴日本军阀都曾用过“反对共产主义威胁”的口号，作为吞并许多民族和侵略全世界的借口。美国反动派想拾起这面早被希特勒用烂了的臭不可闻的反共旗帜，以掩饰其紧张备战的侵略目的，显然是徒劳无功的。
    综观上述美国战贩们进一步扩大战争的阴谋，我们应当得出什么结论呢？这就是美国侵略者虽然在朝鲜战场遭受了严重的打击，但它并没有因此停止或改变其侵略政策，相反地，却在遭受失败之后，更狂妄地加紧战争动员，加紧准备实力，以扩大战争。因此，全世界一切爱好和平的国家与人民，必须继续加强反美侵略的和平运动，必须进一步制止美国的战争阴谋，这是使国际形势好转的唯一办法。如果有人由于朝鲜前线的胜利而忽视敌人准备扩大战争的阴谋，或由于轻信敌人的政治欺骗而麻痹起来，那是非常错误的。我们必须更紧张努力地建设我们的国防力量，加速壮大我们的陆军，海军和空军。更有计划地进行国防经济建设，更大规模地深入地持久地开展抗美援朝运动。继续不断地给敌人以打击、打击、再打击，在胜利前进的基础上，再胜利前进。只有人民民主力量的强大，只有不断给侵略者以重大的打击，才可能迫使敌人缩回它的侵略血手。在世界人民这样努力争取和平的条件之下，克服新战争的危机，仍然是可能的；而如果疯狂的侵略者硬要挑动新的世界战争，世界人民也有充分把握打倒侵略者，打倒产生侵略者的帝国主义统治。
    我们决心继续不懈地为和平而努力奋斗，不管美国反动派如何狂妄地想扩大战争，侵略者的结局总是不可避免要失败的。因为决定历史进程的，决不是美国战贩们的主观意图，而是世界人民的力量。第二次世界大战之后，新兴的中华人民共和国，与强大无比的苏联结成了友好互助同盟，这一巨大的事件，已使世界两大阵营的力量对比发生了根本的改变。以苏联为首，并有新中国参加的世界和平民主阵营的力量，正在飞跃地发展壮大着，这个捍卫和平的人民力量是无敌于天下的。昏迷在新战争狂中的战贩们，总是忽视或不愿意承认这个对今后世界历史进程具有决定作用的重大的新变化，因而它往往漠视或过低估计了人民的力量与人民的意志，而一味狂想实现其不可能实现的侵略冒险计划。这就注定了它们的结局终归免不了失败。这就是美国战贩们进一步扩大战争阴谋的基本弱点所在。侵略者愈是疯狂，其失败就会愈惨，这是客观历史发展所早已再三证明了的真理。
