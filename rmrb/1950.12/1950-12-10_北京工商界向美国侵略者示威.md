Beijing's industrial and commercial circles held an unprecedented celebratory demonstration parade. This was not only the action of the 53,000 people from Beijing's industrial and commercial circles who participated in the parade, but also a concrete manifestation of the patriotic will of all industrial and commercial figures in Beijing.

As the parade passed through the commercial centers of Qianmen Street and Wangfujing Street, every shop doorway was crowded with people, who were all very excited to cheer on their own队伍 as it passed, and chanted slogans along with the队伍. I saw many old men in the队伍 waving flags and leading the cheers. Some shops locked their doors and joined the parade in its entirety. As the leaders of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles said, this grand parade was the result of the enhanced political consciousness and organizational foundation of Beijing's industrial and commercial circles over the past year. Mr. Fu Huating said that this parade had been prepared for a long time from the bottom up, and was held after most of the one hundred and several dozen industries in Beijing had been reorganized. Mr. Liu Yifeng said that the amount of voluntary donations from Beijing's industrial and commercial circles and the enthusiasm of this parade exceeded our expected achievements. Mr. Sun Fuling said that the actions of the industrial and commercial circles proved that they are worthy of being one of the four friends of the revolutionary united front. Indeed, today's demonstration parade by Beijing's industrial and commercial circles fully demonstrated that this is an important component of the awakened, organized, powerful, and inviolable revolutionary队伍 of the Chinese people. This action further illustrates that the four friends of the Chinese people's revolutionary united front are even more united under the common goal of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

Mixed in with the countless red flags in the parade were countless flags with slogans and catchphrases written on them. In addition to the patriotic covenants that everyone in the industrial and commercial circles abided by, each unit also had covenants put forward based on their own business. For example, the flag of the financial industry read: "Do not speculate on goods, do not blindly grant loans, and ensure price stability"; the flag of the electrical materials industry read: "Cherish equipment, save materials, and use electrical technology to cooperate with national defense construction." Many flags read "Step up production to enhance our combat power" and "Ensure unity between labor and capital to resist America and aid Korea." These are not simple slogans but concrete actions.

Why has the industrial and commercial sector launched such enthusiastic patriotic actions? Below I quote a few people's conversations as an answer:

Pan Qinghua of Dongyicheng Tannery said: Before liberation, we were suffocated by American sole leather and glass bands. Under the competition of American goods, we could only make inferior goods, and a pair of shoes would wear out in a few days. After liberation, our industry has greatly developed, and our quality has improved to the pre-war level, ensuring military and civilian needs. The sole leather for soldiers' shoes can last for a year. Our industry has developed from 111 to 218 companies, the number of workers has doubled, and production this year has increased by 171% compared to last year. We plan to increase production by 50% next year compared to this year.

Wang Zhichen of Wuhua Watch Shop, which belongs to the department store industry, said: In the past, we were just salesmen for others. When American goods came, our handicrafts could not be sold. Now we have our own government, customs autonomy, and are no longer harmed by the dumping of foreign goods!

Xu Qi of Qixin Rubber Factory said: Before liberation, the market was full of foreign goods, and we could only produce bicycle tires, machine belts, and rubber soles. Most manufacturers were in a state of semi-shutdown. Now the orders from railways, factories, and mines are keeping us busy. Before liberation, my factory had only twenty or so workers, now there are more than one hundred people on day and night shifts. In order to resist America and aid Korea, the workers put forward the slogan of not letting the machines idle.

Bi Yuantian of the import and export trade industry said: We used to do business with Britain and the United States. Although the current situation poses some temporary difficulties for us, we will never relax our actions to resist America and aid Korea for our own benefit. We are a big country, and we must strive for our due position in the international market, and we must never be trapped in a colonial position again.

Ji Zengshou, chairman of the knitting industry, said: Before liberation, our industry had only about 100 large and small households, and now it has developed to more than 700 households. In the past, American stockings and American goods almost completely crushed us. Now, in the hosiery category alone, we produce more than 73,000 dozens per month. Beijing's first knitting dyeing and finishing company will soon officially start operations under the guidance of the publicly-private joint venture Xingye Company. The workers completed the plant construction work half a month ahead of schedule in order to resist America and aid Korea.

It is not necessary to give more examples to illustrate that Beijing's industry and commerce, with the support of the People's Government, has embarked on the road of normal recovery and development after overcoming difficulties. In particular, price stability has created conditions for the development of industry and commerce. But the greedy American imperialism is jealous of our peaceful construction. In order to defend our peaceful construction, and to develop our national industry and commerce, the city's industrialists and businessmen deeply realize that we can only resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country with all our actions. As Zhu Mingde, a clerk at the Sentai Tea Shop outside Qianmen, said: "Korea and us are neighbors. If American imperialism swallows Korea, it will invade us. We should resolutely defeat it!"

For a hundred years, under the oppression of imperialism, our national industry and commerce could not hold its head up, which is the main reason for our country's poverty and backwardness. But now the Chinese people have stood up. We have a central people's government supported by people of all strata, and our entire nation has awakened. Fifteen years ago, the patriotic movement of advanced intellectuals of "December 9th". At that time, the industrial and commercial circles still only sympathized and supported, but now the industrial and commercial circles themselves have also taken action. This proves that our united front against imperialist aggression is consolidated and powerful, and in the future it will be more consolidated and powerful.

    北京工商界向美国侵略者示威
    重野
    首都工商业界举行了前所未有的一次祝捷示威游行。这不仅是参加游行的北京工商业界五万三千人的行动，而且是北京全体工商业者爱国意志的具体表现。
    当游行队伍经过商业中心区的前门大街和王府井大街的时候，每一家商户的门口都挤满了人，他们都非常兴奋地欢送着自己的队伍走过，并随同队伍一起高呼口号。我看到队伍中很多老头子摇着旗领头在欢呼。有些商店锁上了门全体参加了游行队伍。正如首都工商业界领袖们所说的，这个大游行是北京工商业界一年来政治觉悟和组织基础增强的结果。傅华亭先生说，这次游行是自下而上准备了很久的，这是北京市一百数十个行业绝大部分实行了改组之后举行的。刘一峰先生说，北京工商界自动捐献的数目和这一次游行的热烈情况都超过了我们预期的成绩。孙孚凌先生说，工商界的行动证明了自己够得上是革命统一战线的四个朋友之一。的确，今天首都工商界示威游行充分表现了这是中国人民觉悟了的有组织的强大不可侮的革命队伍的一个重要组成部分。这个行动更说明了中国人民革命统一战线的四个朋友，在抗美援朝保家卫国的共同目标下是更加团结一致了。
    在游行队伍中掺杂在无数面的红旗中还有无数写着标语口号的旗子，这些旗子除了工商界大家一致遵守的爱国公约外，每个单位还有根据自己的业务提出的公约。比如金融业的旗子上写着：“不套购物资，不盲目贷款，保证物价稳定”；电料业的旗子上写着：“爱护器材，节约物力，以电器技术配合国防建设”。很多的旗子都写着“加紧生产增强我们的战斗力量”，“保证劳资团结一致抗美援朝”。这些不是简单的口号而是具体的行动。
    为什么工商业界会掀起这样热烈的爱国行动呢？下面我引用几个人的谈话作为回答：
    东义成制革厂潘庆华说：解放以前美国的底子皮、玻璃带挤得我们喘不过气来。在美货的竞销下我们只能做次货，一双鞋子穿几天就露底了。解放后我们这一业得到很大的发展，我们的质量提高到战前的水平，保证军需民用，战士们鞋子的底皮足可以穿一年。我们这行业由一百零一家发展到二百十八家，工人增加了一倍，生产量今年比去年增加百分之一七一，计划明年要比今年增产百分之五十。
    属于百货业的五华钟表商行王质宸说：过去我们只是白给人家作推销员，美国货一来，我们的手工业制造品就卖不出了；现在我们有了自己的政府，海关自主，不再受外货倾销的害了！
    企新橡胶厂许岐说：解放前市场上都是外国货，我们只能生产自行车带、机器轮带和胶底，一般的制造家都陷在半停工状态，现在铁路、工矿的订货都忙不开。解放前我厂只有二十几个工人，现在日夜班有一百多人。工人为了抗美援朝，提出口号不让机器闲下来。
    进出口贸易业毕原田说：我们过去是做英美生意的，虽然现在情况对我们有些暂时的困难，但我们绝不为了自己的利益而放松抗美援朝的行动，我们是大国，在国际市场上我们要争取我们应有的地位，绝不能再陷在殖民地的地位。
    针织业理事长冀增寿说：我们这一业在解放前大小户才一百家，现在已发展到七百多户，过去美国丝袜和美国货几乎把我们全挤垮了，现在仅袜子一项每月就生产了七万三千多打，北京第一个针织染整公司在公私合营的兴业公司转导下即将正式开工，工人为了抗美援朝把建厂工作提前半月完成了。
    不必举更多的例子已经可以说明北京市工商业在人民政府的扶助下已经由突破困难走上了正常恢复和发展的轨道。特别是物价稳定给工商业创造了发展的条件。但贪心的美帝国主义它是嫉恨我们和平建设的。为了保卫我们的和平建设，为了发展我们的民族工商业，全市的工商业者深深地认识到我们只有以一切行动抗美援朝保家卫国。正如前门外森泰茶庄店员朱明德说的：“朝鲜和我们是邻居，美帝国主义吞了朝鲜就要来侵略我们，我们应该坚决打倒它！”
    百年来在帝国主义压迫下，我们民族工商业抬不起头来，这也就是造成我国贫困和落后的主要原因，但现在中国人民站起来了，我们有了受各阶层人民拥戴的中央人民政府，我们整个的民族觉醒过来了。十五年前“一二九”先进知识分子的爱国运动。那时工商业界还止于同情和支援，现在工商业界自己也行动起来了。这证明我们反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线的巩固和强大，而今后是将会更加巩固和强大起来的。
