Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: A comprehensive report from TASS: The proposal by Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, to Adenauer, Premier of the Bonn government, for the establishment of an All-German Constituent Assembly, has been widely supported by the entire German people. Dahlem, a member of the Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, argued in the Neues Deutschland: "The establishment of mutual understanding between representatives of East and West Germany will make a major contribution to ensuring peace and restoring German unity, while rejecting such understanding means consciously taking the road to war and betraying the interests of the German nation." The Christian Democratic Union's newspaper, Neue Zeit, expressed its heartfelt welcome to Premier Grotewohl's letter to Adenauer, which proposed a path to peace and unity to the West German government.

The workers of the "Max Hütte" steel plant and the representatives attending the railway technical personnel meeting held in Bilexi, respectively sent letters to the workers of six steel plants in Rheinhausen, Watenstedt-Salzgitter, Cologne, Oberhausen, Westerhofen, and Bochum, and the railway technical personnel in West Germany, urging them to actively promote the realization of Premier Grotewohl's proposal.

In West Germany, the Dortmund District Peace Protection Committee sent a telegram to Adenauer, demanding the acceptance of the proposal to establish an All-German Constituent Assembly. The miners of Westerholt sent a telegram to Grotewohl expressing their gratitude. The Nuremberg branch of the German Democratic Women's League sent a delegation to see Adenauer, demanding the establishment of an All-German Constituent Assembly. Even the bourgeois newspaper Frankfurter Neue Presse, in commenting on Grotewohl's proposal, wrote: "At this time of the most intense 'Cold War,' to reject negotiations containing even the slightest possibility of seeking peace, or to create difficulties by proposing various conditions in advance, would be a mistake of the greatest magnitude." The newspaper believes that the Bonn authorities should participate in the negotiations.

    全德人民热烈支持格罗提渥建议
    一致要求谈判成立全德立宪议会
    【新华社七日讯】综合塔斯社消息：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥向波恩政府总理阿登纳提出建立全德立宪议会的建议，受到全德人民广泛的拥护。德国统一社会党政治局委员达赖姆在新德意志报上撰论指出：“在东德和西德代表之间建立互相的谅解，将对于确保和平和恢复德国统一有重大的贡献，而拒绝这样的谅解，就意味着有意识地采取战争道路，并出卖德国民族的利益”。基督教民主联盟的机关报《新时代报》表示衷心欢迎格罗提渥总理致阿登纳的信，这封信向西德政府提出了走向和平与统一的道路。
    “马克思·胡特”钢铁厂的工人和出席在比莱锡举行的铁路技术人员会议的代表，分别致函西德来因豪森、瓦登斯特德——萨尔兹——盖特尔、科恩、欧伯豪森、威斯特荷芬和波却姆等六个钢铁厂的工人和西德铁路技术人员，要求他们积极推动格罗提渥总理建议的实现。
    在西德，多特蒙德区的保卫和平委员会致电阿登纳，要求接受建立全德立宪议会的建议。威斯特霍尔特的矿工致电格罗提渥表示感谢。德国民主妇联纽伦堡分会派代表团去见阿登纳，要求成立全德立宪议会。甚至资产阶级报纸《法兰克福新报》在评论格罗提渥建议时也写道：“在现在这一个‘冷战’最为紧张的时候，对于包含着即使是极小的求得和平的可能性的谈判，予以拒绝或事先提出种种条件予以刁难，都是一个再大不过的错误。”该报认为：波恩当局应该参加谈判。
