    First Candidate Representative
    Li He
    Local Soviet elections will be held in the Soviet Union on December 17th. In October, election propaganda stations were universally established throughout the country. Moscow's propaganda stations have 260,000 propagandists who regularly explain to voters the principles of the Stalin Constitution, the superiority of the Soviet system, and the Soviet government's foreign policy of striving for peace. On November 10th, the Russian Federal Republic and various allied republics enthusiastically began the movement to nominate candidates for representatives to the various levels of Soviets in border regions, states, cities, and districts.

    On the eve of the local Soviet elections, the Soviet people have completed the basic tasks of the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan. In 1950, industrial labor productivity exceeded that of 1940 by 40 percent; in the first ten months of 1950, total industrial output exceeded the pre-war level by 70 percent; in 1950, the total grain harvest was 7.6 billion poods, exceeding 1940 by 300 million poods; 90 million square meters of living space have been built after the war; and in 1950, national income exceeded the pre-war level (comparative value) by 60 percent. While American imperialism is frantically invading Korea and China, seriously endangering world peace, the Soviet people are carrying out the nomination movement for local Soviet elections on the basis of the great achievements of peaceful construction. In Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sverdlovsk, Stalingrad, Bryansk... and many other places, voters have nominated their first candidate representative: Stalin.

    Stalin, in the hearts of the Soviet people and progressive humanity around the world, is the standard-bearer of peace, the helmsman of victory, and the father of happiness.

    Let's take a look at the nomination situation in the Stalin electoral district of Moscow.

    The Stalin electoral district of Moscow is such a district: older people still remember that before the revolution, this was a desolate vegetable garden and wilderness. Now, rows of factories, schools, and theaters have brought a prosperous life. From here to Sverdlov Square in the city center, it only takes twelve minutes by underground tram. The factories and manufacturing plants here produce transformers, physical instruments, scales, silk fabrics, and the famous "Ilyich light bulbs." The industrial enterprises in this district completed the post-war Five-Year Plan in three years and four months, and in the first ten months of 1950, they completed 106 percent of the production plan. In the three years from the last local Soviet election to this one, this district built 150 houses with new equipment, and now more than two-thirds of the residents in the district can enjoy cheap gas for cooking and boiling water. In three years, this district repaired more than 1,000 old houses, spending 40 million rubles; and built 412,000 square meters of sidewalks and bridges. The largest part of the district Soviet's annual budget is the funding for national education and health care, which amounted to 50 million rubles in 1950. This district has 35 kindergartens, 11 nurseries, 14 clinics and hospitals; two new schools were opened last year, and a new children's hospital was built this year.

    The situation in the Stalin district of Moscow is just a snapshot of the situation in the many states and districts of the sixteen republics of the Soviet Union.

    On the evening of November 10th, after work at the Moscow Electrical Factory in the center of the Stalin district, all the workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of the factory gathered in the spacious assembly workshop for a meeting. They were going to nominate their own candidate representative to the Moscow State Labor People's Soviet. The Moscow Electrical Factory is an advanced factory, and many workers in the factory have completed the production tasks of the second, third, and fourth Five-Year Plans. The first to speak at the meeting was Stakhanov worker Izosimov. During the post-war Five-Year Plan, he has completed 24 years of production quotas. He suggested nominating Stalin as the candidate representative for the Stalin electoral district. His proposal was immediately drowned out by thunderous applause and cheers. Izosimov said: "The name of Comrade Stalin is a dear name to every Soviet people and to all freedom-loving people on earth. All our victories are linked to this glorious name." Izosimov proposed: "When nominating Comrade Stalin as a candidate representative, the employees of the electrical factory must once again show their love and loyalty to the great Stalin and their firm will to defend the cause of peace with selfless Stakhanov-style labor." Lu Ming, chief designer of the light bulb factory under the electrical factory, said: "Comrade Stalin's entire life and activities are an inspiring example of self-sacrificing service to the people. We learn from Comrade Stalin's boundless love for our motherland and contribute all our strength and knowledge to the prosperity of the motherland." Assembly worker and Youth League member Klavdia said:

    Stalin's name - in our mouths,
    Stalin's heart - in our hearts,
    Stalin's will - in our cause,
    Long live the great leader!

    In an atmosphere filled with love for the motherland and Stalin, all the employees of the electrical factory unanimously passed a resolution nominating Stalin as a candidate for the Stalin electoral district and requested Comrade Stalin to agree to be a candidate representative for the Stalin electoral district of Moscow.

    The news of the electrical factory meeting spread throughout the entire Stalin district in an instant, causing a new upsurge in politics and production throughout the district. On the 11th, female worker Khorsonova of the electrical factory completed twice the quota. Seventy-eight production teams in the light bulb factory exceeded their plans. The Chainobyshev production team produced 846 more light bulbs than planned in one day, and the Horennova production team produced 1,800 more special light bulbs. The Buyanova Youth production team of the machine manufacturing plant completed 250 to 270 percent of the production task every day. All 35 production teams in the tool manufacturing plant collectively worked in the Stakhanov style. Many female workers at the Sherbakov Textile Factory completed 120 to 150 percent of their quotas every day, and on the 13th, 42 production teams won the honor of excellent quality production teams.

    On the evening of the 13th, the youth voters of the Stalin district held a meeting at the club of the National Moscow University. Young workers, female workers, university students, and middle school students filled the hall. Borisov, secretary of the Youth League district committee, announced the nomination of Stalin as a candidate representative to the Moscow State Soviet, and the whole audience stood up. The shout of "Glory to Stalin" shook the building. Susinovskaya, an assembly worker from the light bulb factory, walked onto the podium and said: "Our youth's entire life and happiness were brought to us by our dear Comrade Stalin. He opened up the path for us to acquire scientific knowledge, high culture, and free creation and labor. The great Stalin taught us to love our motherland and people, to work selflessly, to be loyal to friends, to be strong in battle, and to wage an irreconcilable struggle against enemies." The production team led by this young female Stakhanov worker completes one and a half to two times the quota every day. Like all Soviet people, she not only knows how to work, but also has a firm determination to defend peace. She said: "On our banner is written: 'Peace.' Soviet youth live and work under this banner. Let the aggressors remember: Soviet youth, like all Soviet people, can defend themselves. If necessary, they will take up arms to defend peace. We believe that peace will surely triumph over war, because leading the cause of striving for peace is the great standard-bearer of peace, Stalin." Shanberkin, a forge worker from the transformer factory, spoke about his life. He entered the electrical factory in 1941 to work, then fought against the fascist bandits, and returned to the factory after the victory. Like many Soviet youth, he went to the front and is now defending peace with selfless labor. In order to supply the orders for the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, he completes 400 percent of the quota every day. He said: The Soviet people are not neurotic, not war instigators can scare. Comrade Stalin's name encourages us to work better today than yesterday, and better tomorrow than today! Every product we exceed the plan is a new contribution to communist construction and a blow to war instigators. Gikhmirov, a fourth-year student at the Moscow Institute of Automation, who served as a mortarman in the Patriotic War, spoke about the rights given to youth by the Soviet state, saying: "Now, there are more students in Moscow universities than in England and France. In the Soviet Union, one in every three people is studying. There are youths of 43 nationalities being educated in Moscow." The meeting warmly passed a congratulatory letter to their father and mentor, Stalin.

    On the 14th, the representatives of the workers of the Stalin electoral district held a pre-election meeting in the hall of the "Moscow Soviet" Theater. Representatives of the workers' congresses of various factories in the district, representatives of the Communist Party, the Youth League, trade union organizations, and labor groups attended the meeting. According to the resolutions of the workers' congresses of the Electrical Factory, the Machine Manufacturing Plant, the Sherbakov Textile Factory, and the "Red Dawn" Factory, they unanimously passed a resolution nominating Stalin as a candidate representative to the Moscow State Soviet in the Stalin electoral district, and requested Comrade Stalin's consent.

    On the 15th, the news that Comrade Stalin agreed to be a candidate representative for the Stalin electoral district spread all at once to factories, institutions, schools, and residences. The 40,000 workers in the district were overjoyed, and meetings were held everywhere, and production enthusiasm was even higher. At a meeting at the light bulb factory, elderly female worker Yellina said: "I am an old worker who has been at the factory for 32 years. When I learned that Comrade Stalin agreed to be our candidate representative, my heart was filled with joy. On election day, I must return to the Stalin electoral district from the sanatorium outside Moscow to vote for Comrade Stalin." Female Youth League member Damala recited a poem:

    Hot steel flows boiling,
    The fields are bustling,
    The garden flowers are blooming,
    Comrade Stalin leads us all
    Forward along the glorious road.
    The people sing praises to Stalin,
    The songs are sung happily.
    He is the torch of peace,
    A friend of freedom,
    Our national candidate.

    During shift change, all the workers of the machine manufacturing plant decided: to complete the year's production plan before December 1st. At dawn after the night shift, the Sherbakov Textile Factory held a meeting. This factory, which had already completed the Five-Year Plan in 1949, decided to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule. The second workshop of this factory produced 19,800 meters of textiles on the 15th, increased to 20,100 meters on the 16th, and increased to 20,600 meters on the 17th. Izosimov of the Electrical Factory announced that he would complete the 25th year of production tasks when the Five-Year Plan was completed, so he had to complete four and a half times the quota every day.

    On the evening of the 15th, the meeting of the election committee of the Moscow Stalin electoral district was held. Representatives of various enterprises and organizations attended and participated. The meeting passed a resolution registering Stalin as a candidate representative to the Moscow State Soviet in the Stalin electoral district.

    Although the state Soviet candidate representative for the Stalin electoral district has been determined, the propaganda station is still continuing its intense work. Eight thousand propagandists regularly talk to voters and residents. During the Second World Peace Congress, at the Sherbakov Textile Factory dormitory, in the home of female worker Yekaterina, propagandist Volentina came. She talked about the growth of the world peace and democratic forces, the great historical significance of the victory of the Chinese revolution, and the establishment of the German Democratic Republic as a turning point in European history. Finally, she talked about the signature campaign for the peace declaration. She asked: "Is there anyone who hasn't signed yet?" The female workers all said: "No. Everyone has signed together." "How can we not sign? We especially hate war." "Peace is what we desire and love the most. But the word 'peace' scares the imperialists." Volentina said: "Comrade Stalin once pointed out that war can be stopped, and the power of the people is much greater than a handful of war instigators." Female worker Chirnona said: "Now we think more about Korea. We have experienced more than one war and know how difficult the Korean people are. But we believe that Korea will surely defeat the American robbers. The people of the world sympathize with Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army will surely give the invaders a heavy blow."

    The Moscow workers are now nominating Stalin and members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as candidate representatives to the city Soviet. All the Soviet people are so closely united around the Bolshevik Party and the great Stalin, fighting for world peace and for the communist construction of the Soviet Union.

    新华社莫斯科航讯
    第一个候选代表
    李何
    十二月十七日，苏联将举行地方苏维埃选举。十月间，选举宣传站便在各地普遍设立起来。莫斯科的宣传站就拥有宣传员二十六万人，他们经常向选举人讲解斯大林宪法的原则，苏维埃制度的优越性，苏联政府为和平而斗争的外交政策。十一月十日，俄罗斯联邦共和国及各加盟共和国都热火朝天地开始了提出各边疆区、州、市、区等各级苏维埃代表候选人的运动。
    在举行地方苏维埃选举的前夕，苏联人民已经完成了战后斯大林五年计划的基本任务。一九五○年工业劳动生产率超过了一九四○年百分之四十；一九五○年头十个月工业总产量超过战前水平百分之七十；一九五○年谷物总收获量为七十六亿普特，超过了一九四○年三亿普特；战后已建筑了九千万平方公尺的居住面积；一九五○年国民收入已超过战前（比较价值）百分之六十。当美帝国主义疯狂侵略朝鲜和中国，严重危害世界和平的时候，苏联人民却在和平建设的巨大成就的基础上进行地方苏维埃选举的提名运动。莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、哈尔科夫、斯维德洛夫斯克、斯大林格勒、布利安斯克……等许许多多地方的选举人都提出了自己的第一个候选代表：斯大林。
    斯大林，他在苏联人民和在全世界进步人类心中，就是和平的旗手、胜利的舵师、和幸福的父亲。
    让我们看一看莫斯科斯大林选区提名的情形吧。
    莫斯科斯大林选区是这样的一个区：老年人还记得革命前这里是一片荒凉的菜园和旷野。而现在，林立的工厂、学校和戏院已带来了繁荣的生活，从这里到市中心斯维德洛夫广场，只要坐十二分钟的地下电车。这里的工厂、制造厂，出产着变压器、物理仪器、秤、丝织品以及出名的“伊里奇灯炮”。这一区工业企业在三年零四个月中就完成了战后五年计划，一九五○年头十个月完成了生产计划百分之一○六。从上一次地方苏维埃选举到这一次地方苏维埃选举的三年期间，这一区共建筑了一百五十幢有新式设备的房舍，现在全区三分之二以上的居民都可以享用便宜的瓦斯来烧饭煮水。三年中，这一区修理了一千多座旧房屋，用了四千万卢布；修筑了四十一万二千平方公尺行人道和桥梁。区苏维埃每年预算的最大部分是国民教育和保健的经费，一九五○年花在这上面的有五千万卢布。这一区有三十五个幼稚园，十一个托儿所，十四所医务所和医院；去年新开了两所学校，今年又新盖了一座儿童医院。
    莫斯科斯大林区的情形，只是苏联十六个加盟共和国许许多多的州和区的情形的一个镜头而已。
    十一月十日晚上，斯大林区中心的莫斯科电气工厂散工之后，全厂工人、工程师、技师、职员，集合在宽敞的装配车间举行大会。他们要提出莫斯科州劳动人民代表苏维埃的自己的候选代表来。莫斯科电气工厂是一个先进的工厂，厂内不少工人已完成了二、三、四个五年计划的生产任务。在会上首先讲话的是斯塔哈诺夫工作者伊佐西莫夫。他在战后五年计划期间，已完成了二十四年的生产定额，他建议提出斯大林为斯大林选举区的候选代表。他的提议立刻淹没在雷动的掌声与欢呼声中。伊佐西莫夫说：“斯大林同志的名字对于每个苏联人民，对于地球上一切爱好自由的人民都是亲爱的名字。我们的一切胜利都是和这个光辉的名字联系着的”。伊佐西莫夫提议：“当提名斯大林同志为候选代表的时候，电气工厂职工要以忘我的斯塔哈诺夫式劳动再次表明对于伟大斯大林的热爱和忠诚，和保卫和平事业的坚决意志。”电气工厂所属电灯泡厂总设计师陆明说：“斯大林同志的整个生命和活动，是自我牺牲地为人民服务的令人鼓舞的榜样。我们学习斯大林同志对我们祖国的无限的爱，为祖国的繁荣而贡献自己的一切力量和知识。”装配女工、青年团员克拉沃佳说：
    斯大林的名字——在我们的口中，
    斯大林的心——在我们的心中，
    斯大林的意志——在我们的事业中，
    伟大领袖，万寿无疆！
    电气工厂全体职工就在这样洋溢着对祖国、对斯大林的热爱的气氛中，一致通过决议，提名斯大林为斯大林选区候选人。并且请求斯大林同志同意作为莫斯科斯大林选举区的候选代表。
    电气工厂会议的消息，顷刻传遍了全斯大林区。引起了全区的政治和生产的新高潮。十一日，电气工厂女工何尔梭诺娃完成了定额的两倍。电灯泡工厂有七十八个生产组都超过了计划。柴诺比雪夫生产组一天超额多生产了八百四十六个灯泡，贺连诺娃生产组多生产了一千八百个特种灯泡。机器制造厂的布雅诺娃青年生产组，每天完成百分之二百五十到二百七十的生产任务。工具制造厂的三十五个生产组都集体地以斯塔哈诺夫方式来工作。谢尔巴科夫纺织厂许多女工每天完成百分之一百二十到一百五十的定额，十三日有四十二个生产组获得了优等质量生产组的荣誉。
    十三日晚上，斯大林区的青年选举人在国立莫斯科大学的俱乐部举行会议。年青的工人、女工、大学生、中学生挤满了大厅。青年团区委书记波里索夫宣布提名斯大林为莫斯科州苏维埃候选代表，全场起立。“光荣归斯大林”的驱呼声震动屋宇。电灯泡工厂装配女工苏西诺夫斯卡雅走上讲台说：“我们青年的全部生活和幸福，都是亲爱的斯大林同志带给我们的。他为我们开辟了取得科学知识与高度文化以及自由创造和劳动的道路。伟大的斯大林教导我们爱自己的祖国和人民，忘我地劳动，对朋友忠实，在战斗中坚强，对敌人进行不调和的斗争。”这位年青的女斯塔哈诺夫工作者领导的生产组，每天完成着一倍半至二倍的定额。她象所有苏联人一样，不但会劳动，而且有保卫和平的坚强决心。她说：“在我们的旗帜上写着：‘和平’。苏联青年在这旗帜下生活着和劳动着。让侵略者记住：苏联青年，象所有苏联人民一样，能够保卫自己。如果需要的话，便会拿起武器来保卫和平。我们相信和平一定战胜战争，因为领导着争取和平事业的是伟大的和平旗手斯大林。”变压器工厂锻工杉别尔金讲了自己的生活。他在一九四一年进电气工厂做工，后来跟法西斯匪帮作战，胜利后又回到工厂。象许许多多苏联青年一样，他去过前线，现在又以忘我的劳动捍卫着和平。为了供给古比雪夫水电站的定货，他每天完成着百分之四百的定额。他说：苏联人民不是神经衰弱者，不是战争挑拨者能吓得倒的，斯大林同志的名字鼓舞我们今天比昨天工作得要好，而明天比今天工作得更好！我们超过计划的每一产品，都是对共产主义建设的新贡献和对战争挑拨者的打击。在卫国战争中当过迫击炮手的莫斯科自动机械学院四年级学生吉何米洛夫讲到苏维埃国家给青年的权利时说：“现在，莫斯科各高等学校的学生，多过英国和法国。在苏联，每三个人有一个人在读书。在莫斯科受教育的就有四十三个民族的青年。”会议热烈通过了致自己的父亲和导师斯大林的贺信。
    十四日，斯大林选举区劳动者代表在“莫斯科苏维埃”戏院的大厅举行区选举前的会议。到会的有本区各工厂职工大会的代表、共产党、青年团、工会组织以及劳动团体的代表。他们根据电气工厂、机器制造厂、谢尔巴科夫纺织厂、“红色曙光”工厂劳动者大会的决议，一致通过以斯大林为在斯大林选举区受选的莫斯科州苏维埃候选代表，并且请求斯大林同志的同意。
    十五日，斯大林同志同意为斯大林选区的候选代表的消息，一下子传遍了各工厂、机关、学校和住宅。全区四万劳动者兴高彩烈，到处举行着会议，生产热情更加高涨。在电灯泡厂的会议上，年老的女工叶林娜说：“我是工厂三十二年的老工人，当我知道斯大林同志同意当我们的候选代表的时候，我的心充满着快乐。选举日我一定要从莫斯科郊外的休养所回到斯大林选区来投斯大林同志的票。”女青年团员达玛拉朗诵了一首诗：
    热的钢流沸腾着，
    田野哄闹着，
    园花盛开着，
    斯大林同志领导着我们全体
    循着光辉的道路前进。
    人民歌颂斯大林，
    歌儿快乐地唱着。
    他是和平的火炬，
    自由的朋友，
    我们全民的候选人。
    在换班的时候，机器制造厂全体工人决定：要在十二月一日以前完成一年生产计划。在夜班完工的黎明时分，谢尔巴科夫纺织厂举行大会。这个在一九四九年就已经完成五年计划的工厂，决定要先期完成今年计划。这一工厂的第二车间在十五日出产了一万九千八百公尺纺织物，十六日增加到二万零一百公尺，十七日增到二万零六百公尺。电气工厂的伊佐西莫夫宣布要在五年计划完结时，完成第二十五年生产任务，因此他每天要完成四倍半的定额。
    十五日晚上举行了莫斯科斯大林选区选举委员会会议。各企业各组织的代表都出席参加。会议通过决议，登记斯大林为在斯大林选区受选的莫斯科州苏维埃候选代表。
    斯大林选区的州苏维埃候选代表虽已确定了，但宣传站仍然继续着紧张的工作。八千个宣传员经常和选举人与居民们谈话。在第二届世界保卫和平大会开会期间，在谢尔巴科夫纺织厂的宿舍，女工叶卡特林娜家里，来了宣传员沃连丁娜。她谈了世界和平民主力量的增长，谈了中国革命胜利的伟大历史意义，谈了德意志民主共和国成立是欧洲历史的转折点，最后谈到和平宣言的签名运动，她问道：“有谁没有签过名吗？”女工们都说：“没有。所有的人都一齐签了名。”“怎能不签呢？我们特别恨战争。”“和平对于我们是最渴望的和最可爱的。但‘和平’这个字可把帝国主义者吓倒了。”沃连丁娜说：“斯大林同志曾指出过，战争可以制止，人民的力量比一小撮的战争挑拨者大得多。”女工齐尔诺娜说：“现在我们想朝鲜想得更多些。我们经历了不止一次战争，知道朝鲜人民是怎样的艰苦。但是我们相信朝鲜一定会战胜美国强盗。全世界人民都同情朝鲜。中国人民志愿部队一定会给侵略者狠狠的打击。”
    莫斯科劳动者现在又在提名斯大林和联共中央政治局委员为市苏维埃候选代表了。全苏联人民就是这样紧密地团结在布尔什维克党和伟大斯大林的周围，为世界和平，为苏联的共产主义建设而斗争着。
