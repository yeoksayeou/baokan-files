    The Great Patriotic Production Emulation Campaign
    By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
    The Chinese working class, with its glorious revolutionary tradition and long years of training, has thrown its labor and wisdom into the great patriotic production emulation campaign to resist the American imperialist aggressors and to defend the revolutionary victory won through long years of bloody struggle and the increasingly beautiful and happy life created with hardship. Following the joint declaration issued by the democratic parties, headed by the Chinese Communist Party, on November 4, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions immediately called on workers across the country to unite and launch a patriotic production emulation campaign to increase production and strengthen national defense. Li Yong, the driver of the glorious "Mao Zedong" locomotive, led railway workers across the country in launching the over-axle movement to ensure more and faster transportation and to strengthen the country's transportation capacity. Zhao Guoyou, an advanced producer in the Northeast, led machine workers across the country in launching a workshop emulation campaign, determined to produce more machines and strike harder at the American bandits. Under the leadership of labor model Zhang Zifu, coal miners across the country put forward the slogan "Producing one more piece of coal is producing one more point of national defense strength." An unprecedented wave of patriotic production emulation has surged across the country. Everywhere, the sounds of battle are loud: "The factory is our battlefield, the tools are our guns, pick up our guns and aim at the American imperialist wolves!" In the Northeast region, nearly 700,000 employees were involved in the emulation campaign within 20 days. In Shenyang, 87% of the employees of state-owned enterprises joined the emulation campaign. Nearly 60,000 workers in Tianjin and more than 100,000 workers in Shanghai also launched patriotic emulation campaigns one after another. Not only workers, technicians, and staff members participated in the emulation, but also workers' family members. At the same time, workers in private enterprises in Shenyang, Tianjin, and Shanghai also responded to the emulation campaign to complete tasks ahead of schedule.
    In this patriotic production emulation campaign, employees not only guarantee to complete tasks, but also mostly complete tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas. In the words of the workers, "Completing the task one day earlier is defeating the American imperialists one day earlier!" Railway employees across the country, in the midst of extremely busy winter transportation, have stated that they will complete their annual transportation tasks seven days ahead of schedule. In fact, the Jilin Railway Bureau completed its annual transportation task one and a half months ahead of schedule, and the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau completed all of its annual tasks 22 days ahead of schedule. Eleven larger factories in Lushun-Dalian completed their annual production tasks by the end of November, and the production plans of these factories were larger than last year, such as the cement plant, whose planned output this year is 220% higher than last year. By the end of November, state-owned industries in the Northeast had overfulfilled their targets for thirteen major products. Some factories in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou, as well as individual factories in Chongqing, Xi'an, and Guangzhou, also had similar situations. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 70 major factories and mines across the country have already completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule.
    The wisdom of the workers has been mobilized, and the sound of creating new records resounds everywhere. The steaming time for pulp at the Kailin Kaishantun Paper Mill in Jilin has been reduced to 10 hours per pot, breaking the Northeast's previous highest record of 11 hours and 45 minutes per pot, becoming the shortest steaming time in the country. The average standard coal consumption of Tangshan Power Plant in November was 0.561, creating a new national coal consumption record again, and approaching the socialist Soviet Union's average standard coal consumption of 0.56. After the Zhang Wanshun marshalling team of the Northeast Railway created a new record of one thousand days without accidents, it is moving towards the direction of never having accidents. Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 created 1.2 pounds of yarn per spindle in 20 hours, which is the highest record in the country. Workers in the steelmaking department of Tianjin Steel Plant shortened the steel tapping time, creating a record that was 3.7% higher than the highest daily output in the Red May. Even the production record of cloth in the textile factory on Hainan Island has increased by one to two times compared with the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.
    There are also many vivid examples of workers and technicians' inventions that have suddenly increased production efficiency. Zhang Lan, a female worker at the Dalian Yumin Rubber Factory, used to stop the machine three times when sewing a pair of shoe uppers. She came up with an operating method of "sewing to the end in one go without stopping in the middle," reducing the time for two stops. When sewing the front and back of the shoe, she also came up with a continuous operation method, without wasting a second, which increased her past sewing of 60 pairs of shoes per day to 360 pairs, and her work efficiency increased fivefold, and the quality was qualified. During the emulation in the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the Northeast Railway, a young technician thought in his heart, "Others are using practical actions to strike at American imperialism, what can I use to strike at American imperialism?" He thought over and over again, but he couldn't figure it out. One day, the section chief said, "Improving production technology is our inexhaustible source." This reminded him, he thought: In the past, the factory's welding rods were often cut manually, which was not a good method. If a machine could be manufactured to cut them, it would definitely be much faster. So he ran to the technical section and flipped through many books on the principles of machine manufacturing, but he couldn't find a drawing of a cutting machine. This did not discourage him. He finally found a book on machine manufacturing, studied it early and late, consulted engineers, and discussed it with his co-workers. In his spare time, he worked hard for more than a dozen nights in a row and successfully created a cutting machine, which increased the efficiency of cutting by 80 times compared to manual cutting. Gu Shaoxun of the Harbin Railway Factory invented a rust-removing tool—a rust-removing tooth knife—which increased work efficiency tenfold. Under the slogan of "one person does the work of two," Wang Taixing, a worker at the Lushun Shipyard, adopted new production techniques, which increased the work efficiency of repairing pipes on ships by forty times. Yang Youde, a young worker at the Shenyang No. 4 Machine Factory, improved the operating technology, which increased the production of the lathe by 21 times, and the quality also increased from second-class products to first-class products. Chen Yonggui, an engineer manufacturing grinding wheels at the Sujiatun Grinding Wheel Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau, united with technical personnel to study and manufacture emery, which solved the factory's raw material difficulties and saved the country more than 20 billion yuan (Northeast currency) in wealth.
    In all emulation slogans, workers loudly put forward "conservation." They have never paid more attention to conservation than they do now. They say, "A drop of oil is a drop of blood; a piece of coal is a point of strength; saving more coal and oil is striking more American imperialist devils." Train drivers across the country regard saving coal as one of their main goals of struggle. The national model locomotives all save more than 10% of coal. The Linkou Locomotive Depot saved 130 tons of coal in 23 days. Workers also pay special attention to saving materials and cherishing tools. When the Tangshan Power Plant replaced the underground pipeline of the clean water pump on November 23, it lacked materials. All the workers voluntarily collected materials everywhere and dug out the pipes buried underground for seven or eight years. Zhang Enze and Yang Guoyi of the general affairs department collected 400 kilograms of scrap iron bars in two days. Zhang Chunmao of the Shenyang Smelter saw that the rake used for slagging was thrown into cold water after use, which was easy to break, so he discussed it with everyone and tried to improve this situation. The Harbin Woolen Mill implemented a workshop voucher system, so that every employee can grasp the cost and effectively carry out savings, and the consumption of hemp rope is reduced by about half. The Northeast Regional Company of China Department Store Knitting Factory completed its task ahead of schedule and also reduced costs by 13 billion yuan (Northeast currency). The actual cost of each light bulb at the Dalian Light Bulb Factory is on average more than 25% lower than the planned cost. Workers in all participating national industrial sectors particularly emphasized reducing costs and increasing quality. Most of the guarantee conditions for participation in the emulation write how much quality is guaranteed. Workers know that "defective products" are the greatest waste. They say, "Producing one more defective product is equal to reducing one point of strength to resist American imperialism." The main industrial workers in the Northeast regard producing defective products as the most shameful thing. Zhao Guoyou's workshop often does not produce defective products.
    The employees standing on the national defense line of the motherland also launched a work emulation bravely under the strafing of American imperialist planes. When American planes frantically strafed Andong, Wang Jingbin of the Andong Telephone Office watched the plaster on the walls of her studio shake down and the glass fly all over the room. Suppressing her anger, she shouted to her working partners, "Comrades, now is the time. We must dedicate everything we have and persist in our work." Yu Shiqiang, the stoker of the "No. 247" chartered car group of the Meihekou Railway Sub-bureau, was injured in the head when he encountered an American plane bombing. His superiors asked him to rest, and he said, "We have to work harder. Can the American imperialist planes scare us?"
    In the patriotic production emulation campaign, in order to prevent sabotage by special agents, the main mines and factories in major cities have launched four prevention works—air defense, fire prevention, theft prevention, and special agent prevention. Workers guard their factories day and night and guard their machines, so that they are not damaged in the slightest. Without hindering production, they have organized safety groups. In Shenyang, there are more than 1,100 safety groups in 55 factories, with more than 7,000 workers participating. Nearly 300 safety groups have been established in the main mines and factories in Tangshan. 40,000 workers in Shanghai factories have joined the pickets. More than 40 safety groups have been established in eight factories in Nanchang. In addition to paying attention to the safety of factory equipment, they also expose the enemy's rumors at any time, trace the source of the rumors, and give a serious blow to the special agents' rumors.
    The fighting Chinese working class has carried forward revolutionary heroism, created unparalleled brilliant achievements on the production front, and strengthened the economic strength of the motherland. This shows the improvement of the political consciousness of the Chinese working class, shows the strength of the Chinese people that cannot be easily humiliated, and shows the inevitable failure of the American imperialist aggressors.

    伟大的爱国生产竞赛运动
    本报记者  陈迹
    有着光荣的革命传统而又久经锻炼的中国工人阶级，为了反对美帝国主义侵略者，为了保卫长期流血斗争获得的革命胜利，和艰辛缔造的日益美好的幸福生活，已经把他们的劳动和智慧，投入了抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国生产竞赛运动中。以中国共产党为首的各民主党派于十一月四日发表联合宣言之后，中华全国总工会立即号召全国工人，一致起来，展开爱国生产竞赛运动，为提高生产加强国防力量而斗争。光荣的“毛泽东号”机车司机长李永带领全国铁路工人，掀起了超轴运动，保证多拉快跑，增强祖国的运输力量。东北先进生产者赵国有带动全国机器工人，展开了车间竞赛运动，坚决多生产机器，多打击美国强盗。全国煤矿工人在劳动模范张子富的带头之下，提出“多生产一块煤炭，多增强一分国防力量”的口号。一个空前的爱国生产竞赛热潮，在全国范围内汹涌澎湃地开展起来了。全国各地到处响亮着战斗的声音：“工厂就是我们的战场，工具就是我们的枪，拿起我们的枪呵，对准美帝野心狼！”东北地区在二十天内有近七十万职工卷入了竞赛运动，沈阳国营企业百分之八十七的职工都加入了竞赛的行列，天津近六万工人和上海十万以上工人也相继展开了爱国竞赛。参加竞赛的不仅有工人、技术人员和职员，而且有工人家属。同时，沈阳、天津和上海的私营企业工人也纷纷响应提前完成任务的竞赛运动。
    在这个爱国生产竞赛运动中，职工们不仅保证完成任务，而且大多是提前和超额完成任务。用工人的话，就是：“早一天完成任务，早一天打败美帝！”全国铁路员工在冬季运输极度繁忙的时期中，都表示要提前七天完成全年运输任务。实际上，吉林铁路局已提前一个半月完成了全年运输任务，北京铁路分局提前二十二天完成了全年所有的任务。旅大十一个较大的工厂在十一月底完成全年生产任务，而这些工厂的生产计划都比去年大，如水泥厂今年的计划产量即比去年高百分之二百二十。全东北国营工业十一月底，有十三种主要产品超额完成任务，天津、北京、上海、汉口的有些工厂和重庆、西安、广州的个别工厂也有这样的情形。根据不完全的统计，目前全国已有近七十个主要的厂矿都提前完成了全年生产任务。
    工人们的智慧动员起来了，创造新纪录的声音响彻各地。吉林开山屯造纸厂蒸解纸浆的时间，已缩短至十时一锅，突破了过去十一时四十五分一锅的东北最高纪录，成为全国最短的蒸解时间。唐山发电厂十一月份平均标准煤耗为零点五六一，再度创造全国煤耗新纪录，而且接近了社会主义苏联平均标准煤耗零点五六的纪录。东北铁路张万顺调车组创造千天无事故的新纪录之后，正向着永无事故的方向前进。上海国营棉纺二厂创造二十小时锭扯一点二磅，为全国最高的纪录。天津炼钢厂炼钢部工人缩短了出钢时间，创出比红五月的最高日产量还高百分之三点七的纪录。甚至在海南岛的纺织厂的布的产量纪录也比国民党反动统治时代增加了一倍到两倍。
    工人群众和技术人员的创造发明，使生产效率突然提高的生动事例也是很多的。大连裕民胶皮工厂女工张兰，在过去跑一双鞋面，需停三次车，他想出“一针跑到底，中间不停车”的操作方法，减少两次停车时间；在缝连鞋前头与后帮时，他又想法创出连续操作法，不使一秒钟浪费，这样就使她过去每天缝连六十双鞋提高到三百六十双，工作效率提高了五倍，质量也都合格。东北铁路苏家屯机务段青年技术员在竞赛中，心里想：“人家都用实际行动来打击美帝侵略，我拿什么来打击美帝呢？”他反复思虑，怎样也想不出门道来，有一天，段长讲：“改进生产技术，才是我们取之不尽的源泉。”这一下把他提醒了，他想：过去工厂的电焊条，经常用人工来切，不是办法，如能制造个机器来切，一定快的多。于是他跑到技术科，翻了好多机器制造的原理书，但就找不着切断机器的图样。这并没使他灰心。他终于找到了机器制造书，起早贪黑地研究，找工程师请教，又找工友们商量，在工余之时，一连紧张地干了十几个夜晚，胜利地创造了切断机，比人工切的效率提高了八十倍。哈尔滨铁路工厂顾绍勋发明一种铲锈工具——除锈牙刀，使工作效率提高十倍。旅顺船坞工人王泰兴在“一个人当两个人用”的口号下，采取新的生产技术，使修理船上的管子的工作效率提高四十倍。沈阳第四机器厂青年工人杨有德改进操作技术，使车床生产量提高二十一倍，质量亦由二级品升至一级品。东北机械局苏家屯砂轮厂制造砂轮工程师陈永贵团结技术人员，研究制造金钢砂，为该厂解决了原料的困难，给国家节省了二百余亿元（东北币）的财富。
    在所有竞赛的口号里，工人们响亮地提出了“节约”。他们从来没有比现在更注意节约的了，他们说：“一滴油，一滴血；一块煤，一分力；多省煤和油，多打击美帝鬼。”全国火车司机们把省煤当作他们的主要奋斗的目标之一，全国模范机车省煤都在百分之十以上，林口机务段在二十三天内，省煤一百三十吨。工人们还特别注意节约材料和爱惜工具。唐山发电厂在十一月二十三日改换清水泵地下管道时，缺乏材料，全体工人自动到各处搜集材料，把埋在地下七、八年的管子都挖了出来，总务股张恩泽、杨国义两人在两天内，搜集了废铁筋四百斤。沈阳冶炼厂张春茂，看见扒渣用的扒子，用过后即扔进冷水里，容易破裂，即和大家商议，设法改进了这种情况。哈尔滨毛织厂实行车间本票制，使每一职工都能掌握成本，有效地进行节约，麻绳消耗量约减少一半。中国百货公司东北地区公司针织厂提前完成任务，还减低成本一百三十亿（东北币）。大连灯泡厂每个灯泡的实际成本，平均较计划成本降低百分之二十五以上。在所有参加竞赛的全国工业部门的工人，都特别强调降低成本，增高质量。大多数参加竞赛的保证条件里都写着保证质量多少。工人们知道“废品”是一个最大的浪费，他们说：“多出一个废品，等于少一分抗击美帝的力量”。东北主要的工业工人，把产生废品当作是最羞耻的事情。赵国有车间经常不出废品。
    屹立在祖国国防线上的职工们英勇地在美帝飞机扫射之下，也开展了工作竞赛。安东电话所王静彬在美国飞机疯狂地扫射安东时，眼看着她的工作室的墙皮都震下来，玻璃满屋直飞，她压抑着愤怒，向工作着的伙伴们高呼：“同志们，现在到时候了，咱们要献出自己的一切，坚持工作。”梅河口铁路分局“二四七号”包车组司炉于世强，遇到美机轰炸，头部受伤，上级要他休息，他说：“我们得加紧干。美帝的飞机能吓得住我们吗？”
    在爱国生产竞赛运动中，为了防止特务破坏，各大城市的主要矿厂都展开了四防工作——防空、防火、防盗、防特，工人们日以继夜地警卫着自己的工厂，看守着自己的机器，不让它有丝毫的损害。在不妨碍生产的条件下，他们纷纷组织了安全小组，在沈阳五十五个工厂里，已有一千一百多个安全小组，有七千多工人参加。唐山市主要矿厂已成立了近三百个安全小组。上海各工厂已有四万工人参加了纠察队。南昌八个工厂建立了四十多个安全小组。他们除了注意工厂设备的安全而外，还随时揭露敌人的谣言，追寻谣言的来源，给特务造谣以严重打击。
    战斗着的中国工人阶级发扬了革命的英雄主义，在生产战线上，创造了无比的辉煌的成就，增强着祖国的经济力量。这表示着中国工人阶级政治觉悟的提高，表示着中国人民不可轻侮的力量，表示着美帝国主义侵略者的必然失败。
