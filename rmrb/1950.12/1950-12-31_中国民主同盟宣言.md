Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: The China Democratic League issued a declaration on December 29th protesting against British imperialism's persecution of overseas Chinese in Malaya. The full text is as follows:

    At a time when US imperialism is conducting shameless massacres against the Korean people with airplanes and cannons, thereby threatening our country's security, the persecution of local overseas Chinese by the British rulers in Malaya has reached a feverish peak. The British imperialists' inhumane burning, slaughter, repeated imprisonment, and expulsion of overseas Chinese have made our compatriots across the country concerned about the fate of the 2.8 million overseas Chinese in Malaya, and at the same time, pay close attention to this action of British imperialism that is hostile to the Chinese people.

    On June 18, 1948, the British authorities in Malaya promulgated the so-called "Emergency Ordinance" and declared a full-scale war of aggression against the people of Malaya. After that, the knife of British imperialism was turned against our overseas Chinese in Malaya, closing newspapers and schools, banning patriotic activities, killing and arson, and forcing relocation. The number of overseas Chinese who died tragically under the bayonets of the British army in the past year is impossible to count. In addition, the British army bombed and strafed villages inhabited by overseas Chinese with airplanes. Even women, children, and the elderly were not spared. According to the British side's own confession, more than 100 overseas Chinese have been sentenced to death under the "Emergency Ordinance." According to the British prison department's report, 15,364 people were detained in concentration camps in the past year alone; from June 1948 to August this year, more than 30,000 people have been deported; and the number of those secretly executed is not included. On March 18 this year, the British Colonial Secretary Griffiths announced that 500,000 overseas Chinese would be deported back to China. On November 24, the first batch of 693 deported overseas Chinese arrived in Shantou, and the second and third batches may arrive at any time. All the measures and crimes of British imperialism against overseas Chinese in Malaya fully demonstrate that in order to cooperate with US imperialism's aggression in Korea, it is increasingly intensifying its enslavement and control of the Asian people.

    The interests of Chinese nationals in Malaya have suffered serious harm. As is well known, the prosperity of Malaya today is the result of the labor and development of overseas Chinese. Not only in peacetime did overseas Chinese blaze trails and create the entire wealth of Malaya, but in the arduous three years and eight months of the Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese sacrificed their lives and property to fight against the Japanese fascist aggressors, and risked their lives to provide food and clothing to British and Australian prisoners of war who were abused by the Japanese invaders. But the British imperialism's reward to the overseas Chinese is bloody massacre and persecution. British imperialists believe that this will extinguish the local people's national liberation movement. However, contrary to the wishes of imperialism, such hostility to the people and massacre of the people will only make the local people's anti-British struggle even higher and make British imperialism fall into the quagmire of destruction!

    We, the China Democratic League, like the people of the whole country, will never sit idly by and ignore the massacre and persecution of 2.8 million overseas Chinese in Malaya by British imperialism! We firmly oppose the British imperialism's shameless measures to persecute overseas Chinese! We condemn this fascist atrocity of British imperialism to all peace-loving and justice-upholding people and countries in the world! We call on the people of the whole country to resolutely support the suffering overseas Chinese in Malaya and the displaced overseas Chinese who have been deported back to China with practical actions.

### 中国民主同盟宣言

专栏：抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨

    中国民主同盟宣言
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国民主同盟二十九日发表抗议英帝国主义迫害马来亚华侨宣言，全文如下：
    正当美帝国主义以飞机大炮向朝鲜人民进行无耻屠杀从而威胁到我国的安全的时候，马来亚英国统治者对当地华侨的迫害，也已达到了疯狂的最高峰。英帝国主义者对华侨的惨无人道的焚烧、屠杀、接二连三的监禁、驱逐，使得我全国同胞关怀到马来亚二百八十万侨胞的运命，同时注视着英国帝国主义这种仇视中国人民的行动。
    一九四八年六月十八日，马来亚英当局颁布了所谓“紧急法令”，宣布向马来亚人民进行全面的侵略战争以后，英帝国主义的刀锋就加于我马来亚华侨身上，封闭报馆学校，禁止爱国活动，杀人放火，强迫迁居。一年来在英军刺刀下惨死的华侨，其数目已无法统计。此外，英军并以飞机轰炸扫射华侨聚居的乡村。虽妇孺老弱，亦不能幸免。据英方自己的供认，华侨在“紧急法令”下被判死刑的已达百余人。被拘在集中营的，根据英监狱部的报告，仅去年一年即有一万五千三百六十四人；一九四八年六月至今年八月，被驱逐出境者已达三万余人；而被秘密处死者，尚不计在内。今年三月十八日英国殖民大臣格里菲斯更宣布将驱逐华侨五十万人回国。十一月二十四日，已有首批被逐华侨六百九十三人抵达汕头，第二、第三批随时可以到达。英国帝国主义对马来亚华侨的一切措施和罪行，充分表明它为了配合美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略；正日益加紧对亚洲人民的奴役和统制。
    中国侨民在马来亚的利益，已经遭受到严重的危害。如所周知，马来亚今日的繁荣，是由于华侨劳动开辟的结果。不但在和平时代，华侨是披荆斩棘创造了马来亚整个财富；在三年零八个月的艰苦的抗日战争中，华侨更牺牲生命财产来打击日本法西斯侵略者，并冒着生命的危险以食物衣服援助被日寇虐待的英澳俘虏。但英国帝国主义对华侨的报答却是血腥的虐杀和迫害。英国帝国主义者以为这样就可以绝灭当地人民的民族解放运动。但是，恰恰与帝国主义的愿望相反，这样仇视人民、屠杀人民的结果，只有使当地人民的反英斗争更加高涨，更加使英帝国主义陷入灭亡的泥淖！
    我们中国民主同盟和全国人民一样，决不能坐视马来亚二百八十万华侨被英帝国主义屠杀迫害而不顾！我们坚决反对英帝国主义迫害华侨的无耻措施！我们向全世界一切爱好和平、主持正义的人民和国家控诉英帝国主义这种法西斯的暴行！我们号召全国人民，坚决以实际行动来支援在苦难中的马来亚侨胞和被驱逐回国的难侨。
