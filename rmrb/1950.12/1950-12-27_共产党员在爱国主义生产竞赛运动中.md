    Communist Party Members in the Patriotic Production Emulation Drive
    Liu Zhizhong, Secretary of the General Party Branch of Tianjin Steel Plant
    When the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Nation first began, the Party organization of the Tianjin Steel Plant widely conducted current affairs education. Li Hai, the leader of the Party group in the Rolling Mill section of the First Branch Plant, was a propagandist who enthusiastically worked with other Party members to divide responsibilities and conduct propaganda work in units such as the rolling mill, small shears, and baking furnaces. They used their rest time to read newspapers to the workers, organize informal talks, and convene forums. The attendees fervently discussed current affairs issues. As a result, the vast majority of workers recognized the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand their aggression and strengthened their ideas of hating, despising, and looking down upon the US imperialists. Worker Yan Wenbao said, "We will heat the iron until it is strong to support the front lines." Pan Changyou, a famous labor hero and Communist Party member, said, "Every extra ton of steel we produce will add one more share of strength."
    The Steelmaking Department branch is a model branch for the entire plant. Moreover, the Steelmaking Department has won the glorious title of National Model Workshop. After in-depth propaganda, everyone's enthusiasm was high, and they expressed that they would win the model title again in the patriotic production emulation drive. Therefore, the branch convened a Party meeting; Party, government, labor union, and Youth League convened a joint meeting to specifically study guarantee measures. Each group also formulated guarantee conditions accordingly. In early November, the open-hearth furnace underwent minor repairs, and Communist Party member Liu Guanghe mobilized the workers in his group to strive for early completion of the repairs. Originally scheduled to be completed in 24 hours, it was completed in only 20 hours and 20 minutes. When the lime kiln reached the seventh furnace, it should have been slightly repaired, but stopping the furnace would affect production. Communist Party member Yu Fu discussed repair methods with workers from other shifts. Foreman Zhang Yungui suggested using a patching method. This would reduce time and not affect production. However, this required people to enter the bottom of the dolomite calcination furnace to repair it as soon as the fire went out. This was very dangerous; not only was the temperature very high, but the calcined dolomite falling down would endanger lives. At this time, Yu Fu stepped forward and entered the furnace before the fire was extinguished. This selfless patriotic spirit moved other workers to also enter the bottom of the furnace to repair it. They used iron-magnesium sand ore tubes and broken magnesia bricks to patch it. As a result, five more furnaces were burned in November.
    On November 24th, a section of the refining slag spinning room of the open-hearth furnace suddenly collapsed. The workers panicked. They watched a furnace of molten steel about to be lost and worried about not completing the month's production task. However, it was difficult to repair without stopping the furnace, because the spinning room was under the platform. The gap between the platform and the spinning room was very small, and people entering to repair it had to lie down, unable to look up or stretch their waists. At this time, Pan Changyou, Chen Guxiang, Yang Dong, and many other workers ignored the high heat and the danger of the spinning room collapsing and used firebricks to urgently cover the spinning room. Worker Li Yongkai burned his face during the emergency repair. Due to everyone's active emergency repairs and stepped-up production, November's production exceeded the task by 4.8%.
    Communist Party members can also actively unite technical personnel, so that every employee in the plant can participate in this patriotic production emulation. Sun Shaozhi, a Communist Party member of the Foundry section of the Mechanical and Electrical Department, took the initiative to discuss with master craftsmen Sun Wenqian and Zhang Junqing about challenging other groups to an emulation. The steel melting of Sun Shaozhi’s group improved by 16.66% compared to before. The electric furnace group completed 15 days of production tasks in seven days. Communist Party member Kong Yanbin and his master studied how to reduce the rejection rate of castings. Each group also set a rejection rate of no more than 3%. The rejection rate for production in May, June, and July of this year had reached 6%, but in November it dropped to 1.12%.
    Even more valuable is that Communist Party members and workers can use their brains in production, improve technology, and increase production. Therefore, there have been many improvements in technical operations and raw material matching, overcoming past waste. In November, the first-class product rate of the plated finished products reached 99.2%, creating an unprecedented new record. In the past, the lead wire factory had to change the ammonium chloride in the ammonium chloride pool every month after plating a line. However, in order to save raw materials and reduce costs, Communist Party member Mou Jinshan and the workers carefully studied improvement methods and proposed changing it every three months. This suggestion was approved by the Rationalization Proposal Committee and the experiment was successful. This saves 675 catties of ammonium chloride every three months, equivalent to 10.08 million yuan. Moreover, it ensures the quality of the plated wire.
    In November, the output of the entire plant increased significantly. Taking the Third Branch Plant as an example, the output of ferrosilicon exceeded the original plan by 26.62%. The quality has also been greatly improved compared to the past, increasing by about 10% to 20%.

    共产党员在爱国主义生产竞赛运动中
    中共天津钢厂总支书记  刘致中
    天津钢厂的党组织在抗美援朝保家卫国运动刚开始时，就广泛地进行了时事教育。一分厂轧钢股党小组组长李海，是个宣传员，热心地和其他党员分工负责到轧钢、小剪刀、烘炉等单位进行了宣传工作。他们利用休息时间，给工友们读报、组织漫谈，召开座谈会。会上热烈地讨论了时事问题。绝大部分工人因此认清了美帝扩大侵略的阴谋，增强了仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝的思想。工人阎文宝说：“我们把铁烧得棒棒的，支援前线。”著名劳动英雄、共产党员潘长有说：“我们多生产一吨钢，就多增加一分力量。”
    炼钢部支部是全厂的模范支部。并且炼钢部又曾获得全国模范车间的光荣称号。经过深入宣传后，大家情绪高涨，表示在爱国主义生产竞赛运动中要再次夺得模范称号。于是支部召开党内会议；党、政、工、团召开联席会议，专门研究了保证的办法。各组也随着制订了保证条件。平炉在十一月上旬进行小修，共产党员刘广和发动本组工友，争取提前修好。原计划二十四小时修完，结果只用了二十小时零二十分就修好了。白灰炉烧到第七炉时，应该小修一下，可是停车就要影响生产。共产党员于富便和其他班的工友商量修理办法。领班张云贵提议采用补修办法。这样可以减少时间，不影响生产。但是这必须等炉内火刚灭，人就钻到白云石烧炼炉底下去修理。这是很危险的，不仅热度很高，并且烧炼的白云石掉下来就会有生命的危险。这时，于富挺身而出，不等炉火熄灭便钻了进去。这种奋不顾身的爱国主义精神，感动得其他工友也接连地钻入炉底下去修理。他们用铁镁砂矿管和坏镁砖挖补好了。这样，十一月份就多烧了五炉。
    十一月二十四日，平炉精炼渣子房旋突然陷塌了一块。职工们着慌了。他们眼看着一炉钢水要受损失，又耽心完不成本月生产任务。可是不停火是很难修理的，因为旋在平台底下。平台与旋之间空隙很小，进去修理的人必须卧下，既不能抬头，又不能伸腰。这时潘长有、陈估祥、杨栋和很多工友不顾高热和旋倒塌的危险，用耐火砖将旋抢盖好了。工友李永凯在抢修中把脸烫伤了。由于大家这样积极地抢修和加紧生产，十一月份的生产就超过任务百分之四·八。
    共产党员并且能够主动地团结技术人员，使全厂每个职工都参加到这一爱国主义生产竞赛中来。机电部铸造股共产党员孙绍智，主动找老师傅孙文谦、张俊清商量和其他小组挑战竞赛。孙绍智组化钢就比以前提高百分之一六·六六。电炉组七天完成了十五天的生产任务。共产党员孔彦彬和师傅研究减少铸件废品率。各小组也都订出废品率不超过百分之三。今年五、六、七三个月生产废品率曾达到百分之六，到十一月就降低到百分之一·一二。
    更宝贵的是共产党员和工人们都能在生产中开动了脑筋，改进技术，增加生产。因此，在技术操作、原料配合上都有很多改进，克服了以往的浪费现象。十一月份镀出的成品，一级品达到百分之九九·二，创造了空前未有的新纪录。铅丝厂过去每月镀完一次线，氯化铵池内的氯化铵每月要换一次。但为了节约原料，减低成本，共产党员牟金山和工友们就细心研究改进办法，提出三个月换一次。这个建议经合理化建议委员会批准后试验成功。这样每三个月可节省六七五斤氯化铵，折合人民币一千零八十万元。而且保证了镀线的质量。
    十一月份全厂产量都有显著的提高。以三分厂说矽铁产量超过原计划百分之二十·六二。质量上也比过去大大提高。约提高百分之十到二十。
