(Xinhua News Agency, December 4th) Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement today on the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty:

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, after studying the memorandum submitted by Mr. John Foster Dulles, advisor to the U.S. State Department, to Mr. Malik, representative of the Soviet Union to the Security Council, on October 26, 1950, and the memorandum submitted by Mr. Malik to Mr. Dulles on November 20 on behalf of the Soviet government, authorizes me to issue the following statement on the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty:

I. Since September 18, 1931, Japanese imperialism has carried out armed aggression against China, ravaging our vast territory and causing heavy sacrifices to the lives and property of our people. After eight years of heroic resistance, the Chinese people defeated Japanese imperialism and won the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, it is a matter of course that the People's Republic of China must participate in the preparation, drafting, and signing of the Japanese Peace Treaty. It is hereby solemnly declared that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the Chinese people, and it must participate in the preparation, drafting, and signing of the Japanese Peace Treaty. The reactionary remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang is absolutely not qualified to represent the Chinese people, and therefore it is not qualified to participate in any discussions or meetings related to the Japanese Peace Treaty. If the preparation and drafting of the Japanese Peace Treaty does not have the participation of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government will consider it illegal and therefore invalid, regardless of its content and results.

II. According to the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of February 14, 1950, the governments of China and the Soviet Union agree to jointly achieve the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan in the shortest possible time with other Allied nations of World War II. This shows that the basic policy of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is to strive to conclude a common peace treaty with Japan in the shortest possible time, so as to end the state of war with Japan as soon as possible and enable the Japanese people to achieve democracy and peace as soon as possible. In contrast, the U.S. government has adopted a policy of delay regarding the Japanese Peace Treaty in order to implement a long-term military occupation of Japan. Since 1947, the U.S. government has repeatedly attempted to reverse the procedure for concluding the Japanese Peace Treaty, undermine the principle that the Japanese Peace Treaty should first be jointly discussed and prepared by the foreign ministers' conference of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and undermine the principle of unanimity among the major powers. Now, the U.S. government is not only attempting to undermine the procedure for the Japanese Peace Treaty, but is also further attempting to overthrow the foundation of a common Japanese Peace Treaty.

III. The Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan agreed upon by the Far Eastern Commission on June 19, 1947, and signed by the U.S. government, are the main foundations for a common Japanese Peace Treaty. However, the U.S. government's memorandum to the Soviet government, in its first article, stipulates "Contracting States: any or all nations at war with Japan willing to make peace on the basis of the proposed and possibly obtainable agreement." This means that the U.S. government has openly expressed its intention to overturn the foundation of the common Japanese Peace Treaty as stipulated in the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan. The U.S. government memorandum clearly attempts to use its own proposals and so-called possible agreements as the basis for the Japanese Peace Treaty, to replace the international agreements already reached by the Allied nations that conform to the interests of the world's people and the Japanese people, such as the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan, and attempts to force other Allied nations to accept its own proposals and so-called possible agreements, otherwise the U.S. government is prepared to exclude other Allied nations and brazenly carry out a separate peace according to its own plan.

IV. Regarding Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, it has already been decided according to the Cairo Declaration that they should be returned to China. Regarding the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, it has already been decided according to the Yalta Agreement that they should be returned and handed over to the Soviet Union. There is absolutely no reason to re-discuss these already decided territorial issues. The U.S. government's demand to re-decide these territorial issues is a complete violation of already established international agreements, a deliberate infringement upon the legitimate rights and interests of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and an attempt to achieve the purpose of aggression. The U.S. government's armed aggression against China's Taiwan Province is a vivid proof. Regarding the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands, neither the Cairo Declaration nor the Potsdam Proclamation made any decision on trusteeship, let alone designating "the United States as the administering authority." This ambition of the U.S. government is purely to use the name of the United Nations as a pretext to implement long-term occupation of the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands and to establish military bases for aggression in the Far East.

V. According to the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation, the occupying forces should withdraw from Japan. However, the U.S. government has never shown the slightest intention of withdrawing U.S. occupying forces from Japan as soon as possible, and is using Japan as a war base for aggression against Korea and China. In its memorandum to the Soviet government, the U.S. government requests that the Japanese Peace Treaty stipulate that Japanese facilities and U.S. troops be allowed to continue to cooperate in maintaining international peace and security in the Japanese region. This is tantamount to forcing the Japanese people to accept the long-term stationing of U.S. troops in Japan and to carry out aggression against the people of Asia.

VI. The Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan originally stipulated that Japan should not possess any army, navy, air force, secret police, or military police. That is to say, Japan must not be re-armed. However, the U.S. government today, like its open rearmament of West Germany, is openly rearming Japan. As is well known, the U.S. occupying forces are using the name of the Japanese police to rebuild the Japanese army; using the name of the Maritime Safety Agency to rebuild the Japanese navy, and retaining and repairing Japanese naval ports; training Japanese aviation personnel to establish the Japanese air force, and retaining and repairing Japanese air force bases. The U.S. occupying authorities have released a large number of important war criminals, lifted the purges, and restored the activities of a large number of fascists in order to rebuild Japan's aggressive forces. The U.S. government is attempting to use its military control to make Japan completely a U.S. colony and to drive Japan as a tool for U.S. aggression against the people of Asia.

VII. In order to improve the lives of the Japanese people, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China sincerely hopes that Japan's peaceful industry will be developed on the basis of serving the Japanese people. At the same time, according to the Far Eastern Commission's Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan, the existing economic foundation of Japan's military strength must be destroyed and not allowed to revive. But in fact, the U.S. occupying authorities, in obedience to the interests of U.S. monopoly capital, have enabled Japan's war industry to be restored and developed, and are using it to invade Korea and our Taiwan. On the contrary, peaceful industry is in a state of depression. The U.S. government's policy of strangling Japan's peaceful industry and encouraging war industry is only destroying the peaceful life of the Japanese people and aggravating the economic exploitation of the Japanese people.

VIII. The plan formulated by the U.S. government in its memorandum on the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty completely violates the common goal of the Allied nations in fighting against Japan, and undermines all international agreements related to Japanese policy. At the same time, it obliterates the basic interests of our Chinese people's anti-Japanese struggle, and disregards the future aspirations of the Japanese people. The U.S. government has only one extremely selfish purpose, which is to seize Japan, enslave the Japanese people, and turn Japan into a U.S. colony and a military base for aggression against the people of Asia. Therefore, the U.S. government's proposal on the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty is not in the interests of the Chinese people and the Japanese people. The Chinese people are extremely willing to conclude a common peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible with other Allied nations of World War II, but the foundation of the peace treaty must be completely in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation and the Basic Post-War Policy towards Japan. Only a Japanese peace treaty based on these international agreements can democratize Japan, eliminate Japan's aggressive forces, and prevent the resurgence of Japan's aggressive forces. A demilitarized and democratic Japan without external control will be conducive to peace and security in Asia.

    关于对日和约问题
    周恩来外长发表声明
    我必须参加和约的准备、拟制与签订
    美备忘录抹杀我抗日奋战的基本利益
    【新华社四日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长本日就对日和约问题发表声明如下：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府研究了一九五○年十月二十六日美国国务院顾问杜勒斯先生递交苏联驻安全理事会代表马立克先生的备忘录，以及十一月二十日马立克先生奉苏联政府之命递交杜勒斯先生的备忘录之后，授权本人就对日和约问题发表下列声明：
    一、自一九三一年九月十八日以来，日本帝国主义武装侵略中国，蹂躏我国广大领土，使我国人民生命财产，遭受重大牺牲。中国人民经过八年英勇抗战，击败了日本帝国主义，取得了抗日战争的胜利。因此对日和约的准备、拟制与签订，我中华人民共和国必须参加，乃属当然之事。兹特郑重申明，中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，它必须参加对日和约的准备、拟制与签订。中国国民党反动残余集团绝对没有资格代表中国人民，因而它没有资格参加任何有关对日和约的讨论和会议。对日和约的准备和拟制如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，无论其内容与结果如何，中央人民政府一概认为是非法的，因而也是无效的。
    二、根据一九五○年二月十四日中华人民共和国、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟友好同盟互助条约，中、苏两国政府同意与第二次世界战争时期其他盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结。由此可以表明，中华人民共和国中央人民政府的基本方针是在力求于尽可能的短期内，缔结共同对日和约，以便早日结束对日战争状态，使日本人民早日获得民主与和平。与此相反，美国政府为了实行长期的对日军事占领，关于对日和约采取了拖延政策。美国政府自一九四七年以来，屡次企图颠倒缔结对日和约的程序，破坏对日和约应先经由中、苏、美、英四国外长会议共同讨论准备的原则，并破坏大国一致的表决原则。现在，美国政府不仅企图破坏对日和约的程序，而且进一步企图推翻共同对日和约的基础。
    三、开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告及一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会各国所同意通过的对投降后日本之基本政策，这些由美国政府参加签字的国际文件，乃是共同对日和约的主要基础。然而，美国政府递交苏联政府的备忘录，其第一条，竟拟定“缔约国家：任何或一切愿意在所建议的和可能获得协议的基础上媾和的对日作战国家”。这就是说，美国政府业已公开表明推翻开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告和远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策中所规定的共同对日和约的基础。美国政府备忘录，显然是企图将他自己的建议及所谓可能获得的协议，作为对日和约的基础，来代替已经为盟国所达到的符合世界人民利益和日本人民利益的国际协议，如开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告及远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策等，并且企图将他自己的建议及所谓可能获得的协议，强迫其他盟国予以接受，否则美国政府就准备根据自己的方案，排除其他盟国，悍然进行单独媾和。
    四、关于台湾和澎湖列岛，业已依照开罗宣言决定归还中国，关于库页岛南部与千岛群岛，业已依照雅尔达协定决定交还及交予苏联。这些业已决定了的领土问题，完全没有重新讨论的理由。美国政府要求对于这些领土问题重新予以决定，是完全破坏了已经成立的国际协议，故意侵犯中华人民共和国和苏联的合法权益，企图从中达到侵略的目的。美国政府业已武装侵略中国台湾省，就是一个鲜明的证据。关于琉球群岛和小笠原群岛，不论开罗宣言或波茨坦公告，均未有托管的决定，当然更说不上要指定“美国为管理当局”的事情了。美国政府此种野心，纯为假借联合国名义，实行对琉球群岛与小笠原群岛的长期占领，在远东建立侵略的军事基地。
    五、根据波茨坦公告的规定，占领军应自日本撤退。然而，美国政府不但始终没有丝毫表示美国占领军有早日自日本撤退之意，并且利用日本作为侵略朝鲜、侵略中国的战争基地。美国政府在其致苏联政府的备忘录中，要求在对日和约中，规定容许日本的设备与美国的军队继续合作负责维持日本地区的国际和平与安全。这就等于强迫日本人民接受美国军队长期留驻日本，并对亚洲人民进行侵略。
    六、远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策，原来规定日本不得保有任何陆军、海军、空军、秘密警察与宪兵。这就是说，不得再行武装日本。然而美国政府今天如其公开武装西德一样，正在公开武装日本。如所周知，美国占领军正借用日本警察的名义来重建日本的陆军；借用海上保安厅的名义来重建日本的海军，并保留与修建日本军港；训练日本航空人员，以建立日本空军，并保留与修建日本空军基地。美国占领当局释放了大批重要战犯，解除整肃，恢复大批法西斯分子的活动，以重建日本的侵略势力。美国政府企图用它的军事控制，使日本完全成为美国的殖民地，并驱使日本作为美国侵略亚洲人民的工具。
    七、为了改善日本人民的生活，中华人民共和国中央人民政府甚愿日本的和平工业在为日本人民服务的基础上，获得发展。同时根据远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策的规定，日本军事力量的现存经济基础必须摧毁，并不准其复活。但事实上，美国占领当局服从美国独占资本的利益，使日本的战争工业获得恢复和发展，并利用它来侵略朝鲜和我国台湾。相反的，和平工业则萎靡不振。美国政府这种绞死日本和平工业，鼓励战争工业的方针，只是破坏了日本人民的和平生活，加重了对日本人民的经济剥削。
    八、美国政府在关于对日和约问题的备忘录中所拟定的方案，完全违反盟国共同对日作战的目的，并破坏所有有关对日政策的国际协议，同时，更抹杀我中国人民抗日奋战的基本利益，也无视日本人民的未来愿望。美国政府只有一个极端自私的目的，就是想霸占日本，奴役日本人民，变日本为美国的殖民地和侵略亚洲人民的军事基地。因此美国政府这一关于对日和约问题的备忘录的建议，是不符合中国人民和日本人民的利益的。中国人民极愿与第二次世界战争时期其他盟国尽速订立共同对日和约，但和约的基础必须完全依照开罗宣言、雅尔达协定、波茨坦公告及对投降后日本之基本政策。只有以这些国际协定为基础的对日和约，才能使日本民主化，才能清除日本的侵略势力，才能防止日本侵略势力的再起。一个没有外力控制的民主化的日本，才能有利于亚洲的和平与安全。
