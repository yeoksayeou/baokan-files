Measures for Private Enterprises to Revalue Assets and Adjust Capital

A. General Provisions

1.  All private enterprises nationwide, regardless of whether they have revalued assets and adjusted capital, shall, after completing the usual annual final accounts for 1950 by December 31, revalue all assets (including assets and liabilities) and adjust their capital in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

2.  The revalued assets must be the actual assets existing on December 31, 1950. All assets that are indeed owned by the enterprise but have not been entered into the accounts shall be inventoried, valued, and entered into the accounts.

3.  The valuation standard for revaluing assets shall uniformly be the local prevailing price on December 31, 1950.

4.  In the event of abnormal fluctuations in certain prices, making it impossible to use December 31, 1950, as the standard, the local review committee may publicly discuss and determine a reasonable price as the valuation standard.

5.  For private enterprises with branches, the assets of each branch shall be revalued separately according to the prices and procedures of their respective locations, and then consolidated by the head office for calculation.

6.  If the head office is abroad and the branches are in China, only the assets belonging to the domestic part shall be revalued in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

7.  The value of revalued assets and adjusted capital shall be calculated in Renminbi. However, in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other regions, local currencies may be temporarily used for calculation.

8.  The deadline for completing the revaluation of assets and adjustment of capital shall be determined separately by the local industrial and commercial administrative authorities, taking into account the circumstances, but generally shall not exceed June 30, 1951.

9.  The work of asset revaluation of private enterprises shall be presided over by the local industrial and commercial administrative organs, in conjunction with the tax authorities, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and with the invitation of other relevant organs, groups, and accounting technical experts, to organize municipal and county private enterprise asset revaluation review committees to handle the matter. Local review committees may establish sub-committees by industry or region as needed. The organization of the sub-committees shall be determined by the municipal and county review committees.

10. The functions and powers of the private enterprise asset revaluation review committee are as follows:

    1.  To publicize the purpose and methods of private enterprise asset revaluation and capital adjustment;
    2.  To promote and guide the asset revaluation work of private enterprises;
    3.  To assess the valuation standards for each industry and the industry-agreed price lists;
    4.  To review the materials self-reported by private enterprises on a per-industry and per-household basis;
    5.  To conduct a re-examination if unfair evaluations are discovered or if private enterprises have objections to the examination;
    6.  Other review matters related to the asset revaluation of private enterprises.

B. Revaluing Assets

11. The valuation standards for various assets are as follows:

    (1) Inventory
        1.  Merchandise of vendors or raw materials of manufacturers: The revaluation standard is the purchase price on December 31, 1950, as determined by the review committee.
        2.  Finished products and by-products of manufacturers: The revaluation standard is the selling price on December 31, 1950, as determined by the review committee, after deducting the general gross profit margin of the industry as assessed by the review committee.
        3.  Semi-finished products of manufacturers: Valuation is carried out according to the finished product and by-product valuation, and then reduced according to the degree of unfinished work.

        If the aforementioned merchandise, raw materials, finished products, semi-finished products, and by-products are not listed on the assessed industry-agreed price list, or if the inventory has deteriorated or is unsalable, the value and explanation may be drafted by oneself and submitted to the review committee for approval.

    (2) Fixed Assets
        1.  Land: The standard is the land price estimated by the local land administration authority. If there is no local land administration authority, it shall be estimated by the local government. However, if the market price is lower than the estimated land price, it shall be estimated according to the market price.
        2.  Buildings: The local review committee shall invite construction experts, construction manufacturers, or familiar personnel to discuss and determine a common standard for construction costs and depreciation. The person in charge of the enterprise shall estimate the replacement value and individual depreciation rate according to the above standards, based on the construction and usage, and then calculate and estimate based on the actual years of use. If the years of use are unknown, estimate the number of years it can still be used to deduce it (for example, for general steel-concrete buildings, the common agreement is to use fifty years to determine its depreciation rate as a common standard. Suppose a factory's steel-concrete building can only amortize depreciation according to forty years of use due to machine vibration. If the building has been used for ten years, the depreciation of ten years should be deducted. If the number of years of use is unknown, estimate the number of years it can still be used, for example, fifteen years, then deduct fifteen years from the forty years, that is, twenty-five years, to determine its years of use and deduct depreciation).
        3.  Machinery and ancillary equipment, transportation equipment, models, instruments, etc.: The review committee shall invite technical experts, manufacturing vendors, or familiar personnel to discuss and determine a common standard for construction costs and depreciation. The person in charge of the enterprise shall estimate the replacement value and individual depreciation rate according to the above standards, based on their quality and usage, and then calculate and estimate based on the actual years of use. If the years of use are unknown, estimate the number of years it can still be used to deduce it.
        4.  Tools and implements: The person in charge of the enterprise shall estimate the replacement value and depreciation standard determined by the manufacturing vendor or familiar personnel, according to the actual years of use. If the years of use are unknown, deduce it based on the number of years it can still be used.
        5.  For broken, invalid, or unsuitable fixed assets, the valuation standard is the residual value.

    (3) Claims Assets
        1.  Accounts receivable, notes receivable, and other claims assets: Re-evaluate and enter into the accounts according to the actual possible income amount. Those that cannot be recovered due to bankruptcy, absconding, mediation, etc., or those that have been overdue and repeatedly urged without success, may be removed with supporting documents. Those that are repaid with real units or other physical objects as the standard shall be estimated according to the real price or the current market price of the physical objects.
        2.  Prepaid payments or prepaid deposits: Value according to the contract stipulations or the quality and quantity of the prepaid part of the goods, according to the industry-agreed price list assessed by the review committee. Those calculated in foreign currency shall be valued according to foreign currency assets.

    (4) Gold, Silver, Foreign Currencies, Foreign Exchange, and Foreign Assets: Gold and silver are calculated and valued according to the price listed by the People's Bank of China. Foreign currencies and foreign exchange shall be calculated and valued according to the original amount and the interest due according to the contract, according to the exchange rate of the Bank of China. Foreign assets shall be valued separately according to the market price at the location, and then converted and calculated according to the exchange rate of the Bank of China.

    (5) Securities and Investments: Value at market price if there is a market price; if there is no market price, estimate appropriately according to the actual situation. Value the real public bonds according to the listed price. Public bonds and treasury bills issued by the former puppet regime are not valued.

    (6) Deferred Assets: Estimate their value according to the unexpired portion of the effective period of the expense or the unconsumed portion of the purchased and stored items.

    (7) Liabilities: If the original loan was received in gold, silver, foreign exchange, foreign currency, etc., and entered into the account at a discount, its revalued value shall be calculated according to the price of the local People's Bank of China or the Bank of China (the repayment method shall be handled according to laws and regulations). If it is calculated in real units or physical objects, it can be estimated according to the real price or the current market price of the physical objects. Liabilities such as prepaid payments, prepaid deposits, and unpaid warehouse receipts shall be estimated according to the current market price of the prepaid part of the physical objects. Assets in the to-be-liberated areas or pre-war deposits will not be revalued for the time being.

    For other assets not listed above, their valuation standards and methods should be valued according to the nature and by analogy with the above-mentioned similar assets. If there is no market price locally, the price assessed by the review committee in neighboring areas may be used as the revaluation standard.

12. Intangible assets such as trademark rights, copyrights, and patent rights are limited to those obtained through legal bidding. Re-evaluate appropriately according to the actual situation for the continued effective part.

13. If the assets are insufficient to pay off debts after the asset revaluation, the private enterprise shall increase its capital to re-determine the capital amount, or negotiate with the creditors to handle the matter, or apply for closure.

14. After the private enterprise revalues its assets by itself, it shall prepare a balance sheet before and after the valuation, and a detailed list of the value of the revalued assets.

    The detailed list of the value of the revalued assets in the preceding paragraph shall list the name, quantity, book amount, valuation standard, revalued value, and revalued appreciation amount of each type of asset.

    The difference between the revalued asset value and the book amount is the revalued asset appreciation amount.

15. The person in charge of the private enterprise shall submit the balance sheet before and after the valuation prepared in the preceding article, and the detailed list of the value of the revalued assets, together with the necessary valuation supporting documents, to the local review committee for review. Private enterprises organized as companies shall also attach the audit report of the supervisor or inspector.

16. After the report submitted in the preceding article is reviewed and approved by the review committee, a property revaluation review notice shall be issued. If the submitted report is untrue, the original reporter shall still be responsible.

C. Adjusting Capital

17. The revalued asset appreciation amount shall be listed in the books for the purpose of adjusting capital.

    (1) The revalued asset appreciation amount shall not be regarded as surplus distribution or subject to industrial and commercial income tax, except for offsetting losses.

    (2) The income of private enterprises after handling the usual final accounts for 1950 shall still be subject to income tax in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Tax and its relevant regulations.

18. (1) The person in charge of the enterprise shall, based on relevant laws and regulations and with reference to the past paid-in capital amount and the current business and financial situation, draft the amount of adjusted capital, and the part not converted into capital shall be included in the public reserve to form an adjusted capital plan.

    (2) The person in charge of the enterprise shall submit the property revaluation review notice issued by the review committee, the balance sheet before and after the valuation, the detailed list of the value of the revalued assets, together with the adjusted capital plan, to the capital owner or all partners or all shareholders for agreement or approval by the shareholders' meeting, and obtain the adjusted capital consent form or resolution record.

19. After the person in charge of the enterprise completes the procedures stipulated in the preceding article, he shall prepare the following documents and apply to the industrial and commercial administrative organ for registration or change of registration in accordance with the law.

    (1) Property revaluation review notice.
    (2) Adjusted capital consent form or resolution record.
    (3) Partnership agreement or company articles of association and shareholder register.

D. Supplementary Provisions

20. The specific implementation methods in various places may be formulated separately by the people's governments of various cities and counties in accordance with the provisions of these measures, combined with the specific circumstances of the local area, and reported to the higher-level people's government and the Central Private Enterprise Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for record.

21. Small shops in small cities and towns, and private enterprises with small business scope and no accounting ability in large cities and counties, may be exempted from property revaluation with the approval of the local review committee.

22. If certain cities have special difficulties and cannot hold property revaluation and capital adjustment, they may be approved by the financial and economic committee of the large administrative region to postpone the handling and report to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for record.

23. These measures shall apply to the revaluation of assets and adjustment of capital of joint state-private enterprises.

    十四、私营企业自行重估财产后，应编具估价前后之资产负债表，及重估财产价值明细表。
