    Why Can't Coal Be Bought? Question: A serious problem currently affecting people's lives is the inability to buy coal. We hope you will inquire with the Coal Company and publish their response in the newspaper.

    Why does the Coal Company repeatedly state in the newspapers that they are absolutely certain they can fully supply the citizens with coal for the winter, yet we can't buy 300 jin of coal balls from retail stores number three and five (in District Two)? A comrade Wei (from store three) said that the Coal Company doesn't distribute coal to them. This will cause private merchants to raise coal prices. Should the Coal Company be held responsible?
                                      Citizen Wang Yihua (resident of Houjingjidao No. 3)

    Answer: The Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Coal Company began planning for the winter coal supply as early as August, based on the reduced production at the Mentougou Coal Mine due to flooding this year. Therefore, the coal source for this winter's needs has already been fundamentally resolved. A total of 100,000 tons of Yangquan coal and 35,000 tons of Jiaozuo coal have been transferred in! A total of 600,000 tons of lump and pulverized coal from small mines in Mentougou, 40,000 tons of Tuoli coal, and some coal from Datai, Liangxiang and other places have been continuously purchased and transported. Based on the current production and sales situation, it is sufficient to meet the needs of Beijing and Tianjin.

    The Beijing Municipal Coal and Transportation Companies have cancelled their weekly holidays and worked day and night to speed up coal transportation and distribution. They have established sales outlets throughout the city, including 58 retail company coal yards, 32 cooperative coal yards, 113 consignment stores, and 1,498 distribution stores, and directly supplied coal to more than 900 units. However, during the transfer and supply work, some citizens were unable to buy coal in certain places. The reasons are: First, the coal supply work is too heavy. For example, in November, a total of 130,000 tons of coal were sold, accounting for about 95% of the city's needs. If all of this were handled by the Coal Company, the equipment and manpower would be insufficient. Although workers were temporarily transferred, scales were added, transportation was improved, and working hours were extended, the problem could not be completely solved. Second, some citizens blindly rushed to buy coal at the beginning of winter, and a few coal merchants took the opportunity to hoard and refuse to sell, creating an imbalance between supply and demand in certain areas. Third, some citizens did not purchase according to the coal type matching regulations due to different needs, resulting in uneven sales figures for various coal types. Fourth, at certain times, the congestion of transportation and storage at several fixed coal yards made it difficult for large trucks to transfer and unload goods, affecting the supply work.

    However, more importantly, some consignment and distribution stores failed to fulfill their contracts and illegally refused to sell, resold, raised prices, and substituted (using inferior coal to impersonate good coal, using screened coal to impersonate medium-sized coal), which affected the supply work and caused losses to citizens. According to inspections by the Municipal Bureau of Commerce inspection team and citizen reports, more than 70 consignment and distribution stores had the above-mentioned behaviors. Those with more serious circumstances, such as Tianyihou in Wuyiku, Fuhecheng in Fuzhouguanqian Street, and Jiutong Coal Shop in Baozi Street, have been punished by the People's Court. Zhang Guilin, the manager of Tianyihou, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 800,000 yuan.

    Due to the improvement of the supply work, the phenomenon of not being able to buy coal has been basically eliminated in the past month. The coal supply situation of retail stores three and five is as follows according to the reporter's investigation: each retail store has a relatively fixed supply range according to its own supply capacity. For example, retail store three's supply range is regulated to be north of An Yuan Hutong, and the Houjingjidao area is not within the store's supply range. Store five, due to the small factory site and difficulty in drying coal balls, did indeed suspend supply for two or three days after the stored coal balls were sold out. Now stores three and five are able to supply normally. In order to better supply citizens with coal for the winter, a regulatory system is planned to be established between retail stores. The Retail Company and other units are currently drafting specific measures. In addition, in order to facilitate citizens to buy coal at the regulated price, the Coal Company has printed a large number of advertisements and posted them in various consignment and distribution stores. Citizens can purchase according to the prices and coal types stated in the advertisements. If the price or coal type does not match the regulations, or the weight is insufficient, they can raise questions and report their opinions to the Coal Company in order to do a good job under the supervision of the masses.

### 为什么买不到煤？

专栏：答读者问

    为什么买不到煤？问：目前人民生活有一个严重问题，即燃煤买不到。希转询煤业公司在报端公开答复。
    为什么煤业公司一再在报端发表有绝对把握充分供应市民冬季用煤，但我们向零售第三店、五店（二区内）要买三百斤煤球都没有？有位魏同志（三店）说，煤业公司不发给煤。这样，将使私商抬高煤价，煤业公司是否应负责任。
                              市民王益华（住后京畿道三号）
    答：北京市人民政府和市煤业公司根据今年门头沟煤矿被淹减产情况，早在八月初即开始计划冬煤供应工作，故今冬所需燃煤在煤源上早已获得根本解决。曾先后共调连阳泉煤十万吨，焦作煤三万五千吨！陆续收购门头沟小窑块末煤共六十万吨，坨里煤四万吨，大台、良乡等地尚有一部煤斤运入。根据目前产销情况，已足敷京、津两市之需要。
    北京市煤业，搬运两公司，为加紧燃煤运输、分配工作，曾取消星期休假，不分昼夜地工作，在全市遍设售卖机构，计有五十八个零售公司煤厂，三十二个合作煤厂，一百十三个代售店，一千四百九十八个经销店，并直接供应了九百多个单位用煤。但在调运供应工作中，个别地方曾经有市民买不到煤的现象。其原因：第一、燃煤供应工作过于繁重，如十一月份共售出煤斤十三万吨，约占全市需要量百分之九十五，如集中于煤业公司办理，设备和人力均不够应用。虽曾临时增调工人、增加台秤、改善运输、延长工作时间，但问题仍不能彻底解决。第二、入冬时部分市民盲目争购，少数煤商乘机惜售拒售，形成个别地方供求失调现象。第三、若干市民因需要不同，不按煤种搭配规定购买，形成各种煤斤在出售数额上有不均现象。第四、在某些时间内，因运储拥塞于几个固定煤厂，使大车调运卸货困难，影响供应工作。
    但是，更重要的是若干代售、经销店，不履行合同，违法拒售、转卖、抬价、顶替（以次煤充好煤，以筛块充中砟等），影响了供应工作，使市民受到损失。经市商业局检查组检查及市民反映，各代售、经销店中，有上述行为者达七十余家，其中情节较严重者如武衣库天义厚、福州馆前街福合成、报子街九通等煤铺，已受到人民法院的惩处；天义厚的经理张贵林并被判处徒刑一年、罚金八十万元。
    由于供应工作的改善，在近一个月来，基本上消除了买不到煤的现象。零售第三、五两店供煤情况，据记者调查是这样的：各零售店根据本身供应能力，大都规定有较固定的供应范围；如零售三店，供应范围规定是按院胡同以北等地，后京畿道一带不在该店供应范围以内。五店因厂址狭小，摊晒煤球困难，在存储的煤球卖完后，确曾一度中断供应二、三天。现在三、五两店均能照常供应。为更好地供应市民冬季用煤，各零售店之间，拟建立调剂制度。现零售公司等单位正拟订具体办法。又煤业公司为便于市民照规定价格买煤，特印制大批广告分贴各代售、经销店，市民可根据广告载明之价格，煤种购买；遇有价格或煤种与规定不符和斤秤不足时，可提出质询，并将意见反映给煤业公司，以期在群众监督之下做好这一工作。
