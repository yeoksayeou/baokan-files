Xinhua News Agency Report: The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance, in order to meet the needs of economic construction and encourage active industrial, agricultural, and fishery production, previously stipulated that industrial and agricultural salt would be exempt from salt tax, and fishery salt would be taxed at 30% of the table salt rate. To ensure that legitimate industrial, agricultural, and fishery entities enjoy this preferential treatment granted by the government, the Central People's Government Ministry of Finance has now issued rules for the sale of salt for industrial and agricultural use and fishing salt. The rules stipulate:

I. Regarding salt for industrial and agricultural use: Industrial salt factories refer to factories that produce electrolytic salt, hydrochloric acid, soda ash, mirabilite, medicinal salt, and other factories that use salt as a raw material or main material, and have been approved by the salt affairs authorities. Agricultural salt is limited to salt used for livestock, seed selection, and fertilizer required by various pastures and fertilizer factories. When purchasing industrial and agricultural salt, each factory should fill out an application form, submit the establishment certificate approved by the industrial and agricultural authorities, and apply for registration with the local Salt Affairs Administration. After approval, each factory must obtain a tax-exempt certificate from the local Salt Affairs Administration when purchasing salt, pay the salt price at the designated warehouse, and obtain a salt transport permit before it can be transported. This industrial and agricultural salt must not be resold to others or converted to table salt for personal use; and denaturation and discoloration procedures should be implemented. If there are special circumstances that require the purchase of crude salt, the reasons should be detailed in the application and reported to the local Salt Affairs Administration for approval. For those whose annual salt consumption is more than 1,000 dan, the salt affairs agency should send personnel to supervise the use; for those below 1,000 dan, with the approval of the Salt Affairs Administration, personnel supervision may be waived, but the salt affairs agency must be notified to send personnel for inspection after the salt arrives at the factory.

II. Regarding fishing salt: The salt needed by coastal fishermen for preserving catches and seafood is fishing salt. Fishermen purchasing fishing salt should fill out an application form, submit the fishery registration certificate, or a certificate from a fishery organization or aquatic product agency, to the local salt affairs agency. After verification, a salt purchase license and a salt purchase booklet will be issued. The quantity shall be determined by the salt affairs agency based on the type and capacity of the fishing boat and the quantity of preservation, and shall be stated in the salt purchase booklet. If the original salt allocation is not sufficient due to the peak season of seafood production, the salt affairs agency in charge may, upon verification, approve an appropriate increase in the salt allocation. The sale of fishing salt shall be distributed in installments according to the actual needs of the fishing season. If a fisherman needs to purchase the total amount of fishing salt required for the whole year at one time, it can be sold at one time with the guarantee of the aquatic product management agency and the approval of the salt affairs agency, and the aquatic product management agency shall be responsible for storage and distribution. The validity period of the salt purchase license and salt purchase booklet obtained by fishermen is one year, and it should be cancelled immediately after the expiration or after the approved salt purchase quantity is used up. The salt purchase license and salt purchase booklet obtained by fishermen shall not be lent, sold, altered, filled in, or patched during the validity period. Fishing salt must not be converted into table salt for personal use or sale.

    中央人民政府财政部发布
    工农业用盐及渔盐发售规则
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府财政部为配合经济建设需要，鼓励工农业、渔业积极生产，曾规定工农业用盐免征盐税，渔业用盐按食盐税率百分之三十征收。为保证正当的工农业和渔业享受政府给予的此项优待起见，中央人民政府财政部顷又发布了工农业用盐及渔盐发售规则。该规则规定：
    一、关于工农业用盐：工业用盐之工厂，系指电解食盐工厂、盐酸工厂、纯碱工厂、芒硝工厂、药用盐工厂，以及其他以盐为原料或主要材料之工厂，并经盐务机关审核许可者而言。农业用盐，以各牧场、肥料制造厂所需的饲畜、选种、肥料等用盐为限。各厂在购用工农用盐时，应填具申请书，检同工农业主管机关核准设立之证件，向当地盐务管理局申请登记。经核准之各厂于购盐时，均须请当地盐务管理局发给免税证件，向指定之仓坨缴清盐价、领取运盐票照后，方能起运。此项工农业用盐不得转售他人，或改为食盐自用；并应施行变性变色手续。如有特殊情形，必须购用原盐者，应在申请书内详述理由，报经当地盐务管理局核定。其全年用盐量在一千担以上者，应由盐务机构派员监督使用；一千担以下者，经盐务管理局准许，可免派员监视，但须于盐运到厂后，报由盐务机关派员查验。
    二、关于渔盐：沿海渔业人因腌制渔获海产需用之盐即为渔盐。渔业人购用渔盐应填具申请书，检同渔业登记证件，或渔业团体，或水产机关之证明文件，向当地盐务机关申请。经审核相符后，发给购盐执照及购盐摺。其数量则由盐务机关根据渔船种类，容量，及腌制数量而定，并于购盐摺内载明。如因海产旺盛，原配盐额不敷腌用时，报经主管盐务机关查明属实后，可酌准加配盐额。渔盐发售，均按渔汛旺淡季节实需之数量分期发放，倘渔业人须将全年所需渔盐一次购足时，经水产管理机关保证，并经盐务机关核准后，可一次售给，交由水产管理机关负责保管，分次拨领。渔业人所领之购盐执照及购盐摺，有效期间限为一年，期满或核定购盐数量领完后，应即缴销。渔业人所领之购盐执照及购盐摺在有效期内不得转借，售让，涂改，填注或挖补。渔盐不得改充食盐自用或售卖。
