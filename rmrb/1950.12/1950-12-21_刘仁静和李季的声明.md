Editor's Note: Published here are the statements of Liu Renjing and Li Ji, who once participated in the counter-revolutionary Trotskyist traitor organization.

The Trotskyist traitor group was originally an anti-Leninist faction within the Russian workers' movement, which later degenerated into a completely counter-revolutionary gang. Regarding the evolution of this traitor group, Comrade Stalin made the following important statement in his report "On the shortcomings of Party work and measures for liquidating Trotskyist and other double-dealers" in March 1937: "In the past, seven or eight years ago, Trotskyism was one of the...political factions in the working class, albeit an anti-Leninist and therefore extremely erroneous one, but it was still a political faction at the time...Present-day Trotskyism is not a political faction in the working class, but a gang of unprincipled, unideological saboteurs, wreckers, spies, intelligence agents, and murderers, a gang of mortal enemies of the working class, a gang of traitors hired by foreign intelligence agencies."

After the failure of the First Chinese National Revolutionary War (Northern Expedition) in 1927, a small number of Trotskyists also appeared in China. They combined with traitors such as Chen Duxiu to form a counter-revolutionary small organization in 1929. They lost their minds under the temporary victory of counter-revolutionary forces, dogmatically believing that the Chinese bourgeoisie had achieved "victory" over imperialism and feudal forces, that its rule over the people was becoming "stable," that Chinese society was already a so-called capitalist-dominated society that would achieve peaceful development, and therefore that the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution had ended, and the Chinese proletariat could only wait until the future to carry out a "socialist revolution." At that time, they could only carry out legal movements centered on the so-called "National Assembly" and cancel the revolutionary movement. Therefore, they resolutely opposed and sabotaged the various revolutionary struggles carried out by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and slandered the people's revolutionary guerrilla warfare at that time as so-called "roving bandit movements." Since the Trotskyist-Chen Duxiu traitor group completely fell into this counter-revolutionary position, it could not but become a public enemy of the Chinese people and a despicable tool for the Kuomintang secret service of imperialism to oppose the people. Although the Trotskyist-Chen Duxiu remnants, who were spurned by the people, have disappeared since the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, vigilance must still be heightened against the possibility of their continuing to carry out sabotage and assassination activities.

Liu Renjing once joined the Chinese Communist Party. After the failure of the revolution in 1927, he betrayed the revolution. In 1929, he went to Turkey to visit Trotsky, who had openly betrayed the revolution and had been expelled from the Soviet Union, and engaged in Trotskyist organizational activities after returning to China. Although he claimed to have been expelled from the Trotskyist party in 1937, he continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities in the Kuomintang reactionary organization from that time until 1949. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served in the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang's "Three People's Principles Youth League," the Political Department of the Tenth War Zone, and the "Fourth Regiment of War Cadres," a special agent training institution of Hu Zongnan. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as a writer and editor for the Shanghai-based secret service propaganda publication "Democracy and Unity." In 1948, he worked in the Kuomintang's Central Party Headquarters and the puppet Ministry of National Defense, writing articles slandering the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Revolution until the liberation of Nanjing.

Li Ji also once joined the Chinese Communist Party. He also betrayed the revolution after the failure of the revolution in 1927 and joined the Trotskyist organization. Although he withdrew from this organization after 1934, he did not recognize the serious crimes of the Trotskyists for a considerable period of time since then, nor did he completely break off relations with the Trotskyists.

Liu Renjing and Li Ji now state that they are beginning to recognize their past counter-revolutionary crimes. However, first, their statements are not sincere and frank, especially Liu Renjing, who tries his best not to mention his actual counter-revolutionary criminal acts, but only describes them lightly as simple "ideological errors"; second, no matter what they say, whether they have truly repented remains to be proven by their actions. Liu Renjing is now renamed Liu Yiyu and works as a teacher at Beijing Normal University. Li Ji is now engaged in translation work in Shanghai.

	I. Statement by Liu Renjing

	I joined the Communist Party in 1921 and worked actively under the leadership of the Party. In 1927, after the failure of the Chinese revolution at that time, I participated in the Trotskyist organization and activities in the internal struggle of the Communist International. In 1937, I was expelled from the Trotskyist party due to differences of opinion, but the remnants of Trotskyist thought still dominated me for a long time, preventing me from recognizing the correctness of the Party's line. After the liberation of Beijing and Shanghai last year, I conducted a deep introspection. With the help of the great victorious revolution, I discovered that the errors in my political thought had the following three sources.

	First, I came from a petty-bourgeois family and lived far from the masses. Although subjectively I was willing to dedicate myself and had dedicated myself to the revolution and serve the people, I could not patiently and stubbornly work among the masses and shoulder the task of popularizing Marxism-Leninism. Because I did not do mass work, my thinking always tended to underestimate the strength of the masses. Therefore, I always criticized the Party's line as adventurous, believing that the revolution would inevitably fail under this line. In fact, this only showed that I was backward, under the pressure of bourgeois ideology, and spreading the influence of this ideology to prevent the revolution from advancing.

	Second, due to the inferiority of petty-bourgeois liberalism, I was self-righteous and unwilling to obey organizational discipline. Therefore, when I disagreed with the Party's line, I engaged in factional activities that split the Party, actually weakening the strength of the revolution and making it easier for the counter-revolutionary forces to consolidate. The organizational principle of the Bolshevik Party is democratic centralism, that is, while Party members must implement the Party's policies in their daily work, they can also put forward opinions to the Party's leading organs at any time in order to achieve changes in these policies. I verbally acknowledged this principle, but actually undermined it.

	Third, my thought essentially represented the upper-level petty bourgeoisie, so I often confused the boundaries between revolution and counter-revolution, fantasizing that I could compromise with the counter-revolution and carry out reforms under the rule of the counter-revolution. This was forgetting or denying the simplest truth of Marxism-Leninism, that is, "The working class cannot get rid of the oppression of capitalism through slow changes, through reforms...In order not to make mistakes in politics, one must be a revolutionary, not a reformist...One must implement an irreconcilable proletarian class policy, not a reformist policy that reconciles the interests of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." (Stalin)

	The victory of the Chinese revolution made me more clearly recognize the true face of my past political thought, that is, I was a petty-bourgeois democrat, a Menshevik, not a Bolshevik Leninist. The thought of petty-bourgeois democratic Mensheviks can never lead the revolution to victory. Only in the process of ruthlessly criticizing Menshevik thought can Bolshevism grow and complete the tasks of the revolution.

	Due to my separation from the masses, unwillingness to obey the Party's discipline, and the thought that represented the upper-level petty bourgeoisie, I was politically opposed to the Party for a long time, manifested in completely different views on the various issues of the Chinese revolution and the international revolution, and facts and experience have proved that I was completely wrong.

	Regarding the Chinese revolution, I believed that after the failure of the last Great Revolution, China must go through a period of economic recovery or considerable capitalist development before the Communist Party could seize power. The next revolution would be an expanded reprint of the 1925-27 revolution. Based on this view, I believed that before the subsequent revolution occurred, the Communist Party should concentrate its efforts in the cities and engage in democratic movements. I did not know that in China under the joint rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang, economic development was extremely weak and limped along, unable to withstand the destructive effects of imperialism and feudal forces. Revolutionaries could not find a foothold in the cities, and the democratic movement of the workers could not grow to the point of seizing power. My thinking clung to the path of the Russian revolutionary victory, and I did not understand the characteristics of the Chinese revolution. As Chairman Mao pointed out, the characteristic is that China is different from Western countries and cannot have peaceful and legal trade union movements and parliamentary movements. Revolutionary struggle is armed struggle. Due to this erroneous system of thought, I doubted that the revolution led by the Party and based on the peasants could be victorious. After the victory of the War of Resistance, I was even more confused by the prospect of the United States helping China develop its industry, thinking that the Party should lay down its arms and engage in democratic movements. I did not know that during the Political Consultative Conference period, the Party made the greatest concessions on the issue of military reorganization in order to strive for the peaceful development of the country. Only because the Kuomintang, which represented the landlords and gentry, was determined to eliminate the strength of the Communist Party in order to maintain its feudal rule, did the Party carry out a war of self-defense and liberation. Due to the logical development of my erroneous thinking, in the two years before the victory of the War of Liberation, that is, the two years of the most intense class struggle, I actually stood on the side of the Kuomintang and criticized the Party's revolutionary line.

	Regarding the international revolution, I accepted Trotsky's ready-made views in the past without examining the factual content. Trotsky criticized the lack of democracy within the All-Union Communist Party, believing that the Russian revolution would follow the old path of the failure of the French Revolution, that is, a "Thermidorian" coup would occur due to the differentiation within the ruling party. He did not know the value of the proletarian revolutionary party, which lies in its ability to learn lessons from past failed revolutions and avoid repeating their mistakes. Trotsky's demand for democracy was intended to shake the stability and prestige of the Party's leading organs. He did not know that when concentrating the strength of the people of the whole country, working selflessly, and engaging in arduous economic construction, in order to prevent and combat some petty-bourgeois centrifugal hedonistic individualistic tendencies from reviving under the guise of democracy, the stability and prestige of the Party's leading organs were absolutely necessary. Trotsky attacked the All-Union Communist Party for betraying the world revolution. The fact is that the existence of the Soviet Union and the interests of the world revolution are inseparable. However, when the proletarian revolutionary movement is in a downturn, it is permissible for the revolutionary strategy to make some temporary compromises with bourgeois countries or hostile parties in order to protect the revolutionary regime. Due to the continued existence of the Soviet Union and its victory in the Second World War, the revolutionary movements in various countries after the war were able to develop and achieve great victories in Eastern Europe and China. It was Stalin's firm will and genius leadership that defended the Soviet Union and guaranteed the development of the revolutionary movements in various countries after the war. As for Trotsky, before this war, he predicted that if no revolution occurred in advanced countries during the war, the socialist Soviet Union would inevitably fail.

	From the time the Trotskyist faction was formed, the Communist International pointed out that it used left-leaning empty talk and revolutionary rhetoric to cover up its Menshevikism, liquidationism, and pessimism, and would inevitably go to the counter-revolutionary camp in the future. The development of Trotskyist factions in various countries later confirmed the correctness of this prediction.

	Now the Chinese revolution has been victorious, and for the first time in Chinese history, there is a truly unified, capable, prestigious, and clean democratic government that is supported by the broad masses of the people. The victory of the Chinese revolution should first be attributed to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, especially Chairman Mao's ability to integrate the theory of Marxism-Leninism with the reality of the Chinese revolution. The Marxism-Leninism that I understood in the past was idealistic and lacked revolutionary practice, so failure was inevitable. In the future, I must learn from Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. I made serious political mistakes in the past, and in the future, I will resolutely work hard under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao to build a new China. I hereby declare this.

	II. Statement by Li Ji

	After the failure of the Great Revolution in China from 1925 to 1927, a Trotskyist Chen Duxiu faction appeared in 1929. I was also one of the participants, but I withdrew in 1934. In my article criticizing Hu Shi in the first issue of the sixth volume of the "University Monthly" in 1947, I mentioned in passing that "for the past twelve or thirteen years, I have not belonged to any party," which refers to this matter.

	Until the end of May last year, I spent fifteen years of solitary translating and writing life in Shanghai. After liberation, I made it public. Now, I should make a statement about this past history.

	First, from a public perspective, China is a traditional autocratic country with more than three thousand years of history. In recent centuries, it has gradually become a semi-colony. Therefore, the Chinese people have suffered from the double oppression of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. In the countryside, the landlords are severely exploited, and the peasants cannot get land and cannot solve the minimum living problems. In the cities, bureaucratic capitalists collude with international imperialism to manipulate our economic lifeline and strangle our national industry. To liberate China, there is only one revolutionary road of anti-feudalism and anti-imperialism; and peasant warfare should be the main force, first, it addresses the weakness of the traitorous government's lack of military strength in the vast rural areas, making it easier to solve the peasants' land problem; second, the basic forces cultivated in the rural areas, once strengthened, can move to the cities, overthrow the traitorous government, and clear away the forces of imperialism.

	The Chen Duxiu faction could not see this situation clearly, let alone distinguish the urgency and importance, and blindly took the so-called "National Assembly" as its banner, blindly opposing the CCP's armed revolution, and even falsely accusing it of being "bandits" and "roving bandits." This is indeed canceling the revolution and becoming completely counter-revolutionary.

	Since this faction cannot grasp reality and put forward strategies that can be accepted by the general public, it has entered a dead end. Its members then began to degenerate, throwing themselves under Chiang Kai-shek's gang and becoming its pawns. Until Japan surrendered, Peng Shuzhi, one of the main members of this faction, still founded two public magazines in Shanghai, using all the empty words of "revolution" to attack every action of the CCP, hoping to confuse right and wrong and bewilder the youth.

	As for me personally, due to my long-term secret life, I developed a habit of focusing on reading and translating and rarely taking action. Most of my knowledge comes from books rather than from practice. The reason why I joined the Trotskyist Chen Duxiu faction was that I hoped that the Chinese workers' movement could be like the Western democratic countries, rising again after each revolutionary failure to fight for basic rights, participate in and even lead the democratic movement, in order to usher in the future revolutionary upsurge. But I ignored China's traditional autocratic politics and the enormous power of peasant struggle, which led me to take a contrary and reactionary path. Soon, due to the lessons of facts and the corroboration of theories, I gradually understood this situation. At the same time, I deeply felt that the Trotskyist Chen Duxiu faction was confined to the cities, did not take action itself, and specialized in attacking the CCP's resolute and arduous actions—helping the enemy in this way, in any case, was not right. So, due to a final conflict, I announced my withdrawal sixteen years ago. But I failed to recognize the reactionary nature of the Trotskyist Chen Duxiu faction early on, and I also failed to publicly announce my break with it after withdrawing, which was wrong. When Peng Shuzhi used a pseudonym to promote Lao Tzu's theory in the inaugural issue of "Seeking Truth" in 1946 and prepared to combine this theory with Trotskyism (he said this to people), I stood up and attacked him head-on, again and again, until he suppressed my counter-attack text and refused to publish it.

	Secondly, when the Chinese social history debate took place more than twenty years ago, I believed that the Zhou Dynasty was a feudal society, and from the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Qing Dynasty was a semi-feudal society. Since then, although I have not had time to study Chinese history again, I have not changed my opinion until three years ago. Because the "Examination of Feudalism" in the Wenxian Tongkao clearly stated: "Establishing a country is called enfeoffment, and dividing land is called establishment." The Qin Dynasty abolished enfeoffment and established prefectures and counties. From the Han Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, most of them were in a situation of enfeoffment without establishing a country, so I called it semi-feudal. However, two years ago, when I read Western history, I discovered that Western countries also often have disputes over whether there is feudalism or not. I began to notice that the issue of feudalism cannot be judged solely based on the literal meaning, or even on a political system, but should be measured by the essence of the social structure. In the past half a year, I have seen for the first time in the newspapers the many oppressions and exploitations in rural areas, mines, and cities, which are all feudal rather than capitalist (the foreman system is one example). By extrapolation, the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Qing Dynasty cannot be called a semi-feudal society. Otherwise, what is the other half? In the past, I always thought it was commercial capitalism. In fact, during this long period, foreign troubles were frequent, there was one period of order and one period of chaos, and everything tended to stagnate. Commerce was not universally developed, especially in the countryside. Moreover, commerce cannot independently constitute capitalism. In feudal society, the means of oppression and exploitation used in commerce are still feudal, not capitalist. Therefore, from the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Qing Dynasty, it was still a feudal society.

	All major issues related to reality are often extremely complex and require the combination of correct theory and practice, and careful and long-term consideration before a decision can be made. More than twenty years ago, relying on the courage of a young man and one-sided materials from books, I rashly joined the Trotskyist Chen Duxiu faction and judged the nature of Chinese society, which was wrong. But seeing the proof of the facts, I am willing to humbly admit and correct my mistakes.

	The Trotskyist faction believes that the revolution in China at this stage is socialist from the very beginning (led by the dictatorship of the proletariat). This view is absurd. In my article "Democracy at the Present Stage" drafted in November 1945 (published in the inaugural issue of "Seeking Truth" the following year), I admitted that before the proletarian socialist revolution, there should be a democratic stage (that is, the "present stage"). During this period, peasants should be distributed land, workers should participate in the management of production, and so on. In short, "the democracy I demand is not only political, but also economic and social." I fully support Chairman Mao's theory of first going through the New Democratic Revolution and then transitioning to the Socialist Revolution.

	Now the national liberation is nearing completion, and the construction of New Democracy is just beginning. I am willing to sincerely work for the motherland with the greatest enthusiasm, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, standing in my own position.

### 刘仁静和李季的声明

专栏：

    刘仁静和李季的声明
    编者按：这里发表的是曾经参加反革命的托洛茨基叛徒组织的刘仁静和李季二人的声明书。
    托洛茨基叛徒集团原来是俄国工人运动中的一个反列宁主义的派别，后来堕落成为完全反革命的匪帮。关于这个叛徒集团的演变，斯大林同志曾经在一九三七年三月“论党工作之缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”的报告中作过如下的重要的说明：“过去，在七八年以前，托洛茨基主义曾是工人阶级中的……政派之一，固然，是一个反列宁主义，因此也就是极端错误的政派，可是，它当时总算是一个政派。……现时的托洛茨基主义，并不是工人阶级中的政派，而是一伙无原则的、无思想的、暗害者、军事破坏者、侦探间谍、杀人凶手的匪帮，是工人阶级之死敌的匪帮，是外国侦探机关雇佣的奸细。”
    在中国第一次国内革命战争（北伐战争）在一九二七年遭受失败以后，中国也出现了少数托洛茨基分子，他们与陈独秀等叛徒相结合，在一九二九年形成了一个反革命的小组织。他们在反革命势力的暂时胜利下丧魂失魄，武断地认为中国资产阶级对于帝国主义与封建势力已经取得了“胜利”，它对于人民的统治已趋“稳定”，中国社会已经是所谓资本主义占优势并将得到和平发展的社会，因此中国资产阶级民主革命已经完结，中国无产阶级只有待到将来再去举行“社会主义革命”，在当时，就只能进行以所谓“国民会议”为中心口号的合法运动，而取消革命运动，因此他们坚决地反对和破坏中国共产党和中国人民所进行的各种革命斗争，并污蔑当时的人民革命游击战争为所谓“流寇运动”。托洛茨基——陈独秀叛徒集团既然完全堕入这种反革命立场，就不能不成为中国人民的公敌和帝国主义国民党特务机关反对人民的卑污工具。被人民所唾弃的托洛茨基——陈独秀残余分子，在中国人民革命胜利以后虽然已经销声匿迹，但是对于他们继续进行破坏和暗害行动的可能性，仍然应当提高警惕。
    刘仁静曾经加入中国共产党，在一九二七年时革命失败后即叛变了革命，一九二九年曾到土耳其去拜访已经公开叛变革命而被苏联政府驱逐出境的托洛茨基，回国后进行托派的组织活动。虽然他自称在一九三七年已被托派开除，但从那个时期直至一九四九年止他一直都在国民党反动派组织中继续进行反革命活动。在抗日战争期间，他曾在国民党的“三民主义青年团”的宣传处，第十战区政治部，及胡宗南的特务训练机关“战干第四团”担任职务。抗日战争结束后，曾为上海的特务造谣刊物《民主与统一》担任写作与编辑；一九四八年，在国民党的中央党部和伪国防部工作，写作诽谤中国共产党和人民革命的文字，一直到南京解放。
    李季也曾经加入中国共产党，也是在一九二七年革命失败后叛变革命而加入托派组织的。虽然他在一九三四年后退出这个组织，但是从那时以来，在相当长的时期内并没有认识托派的严重罪恶，也没有与托派分子完全断绝关系。
    刘仁静和李季现在表示他们开始认识了自己过去的反革命罪恶。但是第一，他们的这种表示还不是诚恳坦白的，特别是刘仁静竭力不提及自己的实际反革命罪恶行为，而只把它们轻描淡写地说成是简单的“思想上的错误”；第二，无论他们说得怎样，他们是否确实有所悔悟，仍然有待于他们的行动的证明。刘仁静现改名刘亦宇，在北京师范大学担任教师，李季现在在上海从事翻译工作。
  一、刘仁静的声明
    我于一九二一年加入共产党，在党的领导下积极工作，至一九二七年，在当时中国大革命失败后，我在共产国际内部的斗争中参加了托洛茨基派的组织及活动，一九三七年因意见不同又为托派开除，但托派思想的残余仍支配着我很久，使我不能认识党的路线之正确。去年京沪解放以后我进行了深刻的反省，由于伟大的胜利的革命之助，我发现了我政治思想的错误有以下三个根源。
    第一，我出身于小资产阶级的家庭，生活不接近群众，虽然主观上愿献身而且曾献身于革命，为人民服务，但总不能耐心的顽强的在群众中工作，担负起把马列主义通俗化的任务。由于我不作群众工作，我的思想总倾向于把群众的力量估计很低，因此总批评党的路线是冒险的，在这种路线下革命必遭失败。实际这只表示我的落伍，受资产阶级思想的压力，并传播这一思想的影响以阻止革命的前进。
    第二，由于小资产阶级自由主义的劣根性，我自以为是，不肯服从组织的纪律，因此当我不同意党的路线的时候便闹分裂的派别活动，实际是削弱革命的力量，让反革命势力更容易巩固起来。布尔什维克党的组织原则是民主集中制，即党员一面在日常工作中须执行党的政策，一面可向党的领导机关时时提出意见，以求达到这政策的改变。我在口头上是承认这原则的，实际是破坏了它。
    第三，我的思想实质上是代表上层小资产阶级，所以我常混淆革命与反革命的界限，幻想可以与反革命妥协，和在反革命的统治之下进行改良，这是忘记了或否定了马列主义的最简单的真理，即是“工人阶级摆脱资本主义的压迫决不能经过缓慢变化，经过改良来实现………为了在政治上不犯错误，便要做革命家，而不要做改良主义者，……便要执行不调和的无产阶级的阶级政策，而不要执行调协无产阶级与资产阶级利益的改良主义政策。”（斯大林）
    中国革命的胜利使我更清楚的认识我过去政治思想的真面目，即是说我过去是一个小资产阶级民主主义者，是一个门什维克，而不是一个布尔什维克列宁主义者。小资产阶级民主主义的门什维克的思想决不能领导革命达到胜利，只有在无情的批判门什维克思想的过程中，布尔什维克主义才能壮大起来完成革命的任务。
    由于我的脱离群众，不肯服从党的纪律和代表上层小资产阶级的思想，所以我在政治上长期的和党对立，表现于对中国革命和对国际革命的诸问题的看法完全不同，而事实和经验都证明我是完全错误。
    关于中国革命问题，我以为在上次大革命失败以后，中国必须经过一个经济恢复或资本主义相当发展的时期，共产党才能进行夺取政权，下次革命将为一九二五——二七年革命之扩大的再版。本此见解，我以为在以后的革命发生以前共产党应集中力量于城市，从事民主运动。不知在帝国主义和国民党联合统治下的中国，经济发展极微弱而跛行，不及帝国主义及封建势力之破坏作用。革命分子在城市中无法容身，工人的民主运动亦无法生长至夺取政权的程度。我的思想执着于俄国革命胜利的道路，不了解中国革命的特点，这一特点是，如毛主席所指出，中国和西方国家不同，不可能有和平的合法的工会运动及议会运动。革命的斗争即是武装的斗争。由于我这一错误的思想体系，我于是怀疑在党领导下以农民为基础的革命能够胜利。在抗战胜利后，我更迷惑于美帝帮助中国发展工业的前途，以为党应当放下武器，从事民主运动。不知党在政协时期，为争取国家的和平发展，关于整军问题不惜作最大让步。只因为代表豪绅地主的国民党，为维持其封建统治，必欲消灭共产党的实力，党才进行自卫的和解放的战争。由于我的错误思想的逻辑发展，在解放战争胜利以前的两年，亦即阶级斗争最激烈的两年，我竟站在国民党一方面，批评党的革命路线。
    关于国际革命问题，我过去接受托洛茨基的现成见解，不去考察事实内容。托洛茨基批评联共党内不民主，以为俄国革命将走法国大革命失败的旧路。即由于执政党内部的分化而发生“德尔米多”式的政变，不知无产阶级革命政党的可贵，即在于它能从过去失败的革命获得教训，避免重复它们的错误。托洛茨基的要求民主，用意在于动摇党的领导机关的稳定和威信，不知，在集中全国人民的力量，忘我的劳动，从事艰巨的经济建设的时候，为了防止和打击一些小资产阶级离心的享乐的个人主义倾向，假借民主主义的名义复活，党的领导机关的稳定和威信正是绝对必须的。托洛茨基攻击联共背叛世界革命，事实是，苏联的存在和世界革命的利益不可分，不过在无产阶级革命运动低落的时候，和资产阶级国家或敌对的政党成立一些临时的妥协，以保障革命的政权，为革命的战略所许可。由于苏联的继续存在及其在第二次大战中的胜利，战后各国革命运动才能发展，并在中东欧及中国取得了伟大的胜利。正是斯大林的坚决意志和天才领导保卫了苏联和保证了战后各国革命运动之发展。至于托洛茨基在这次战争以前则预言在战争中如果先进国家不发生革命，社会主义的苏联一定会失败。
    从托派形成的时候起，共产国际即指出它是以左倾的空谈、革命的词句掩盖其孟什维克主义、取消主义、悲观主义的实质，将来必然走到反革命的阵营。以后各国托派的发展都证实了这一预见之正确。
    现在中国革命已胜利，中国历史上第一次出现了一个真正统一的、有能力和有威望的、廉洁的民主政府，得到广大民众的拥护。中国革命之能胜利，当首先归功于中国共产党的正确领导，尤其是毛主席能把马列主义的理论融合于中国革命的实际。我过去所理解的马列主义是观念主义的，缺乏革命的实践，所以失败是必然的。今后必须向毛主席和中国共产党学习。我过去犯了严重的政治错误，以后决重在党及毛主席的领导下，为建设新中国而努力，谨此声明。
  二、李季的声明
    中国自一九二五至二七年大革命失败后，一九二九年出现一个托陈派。我也是参加者之一，不过于一九三四年即行退出。我在一九四七年大学月刊六卷一期批评胡适的一篇论文中，顺便提及“十二、三年来，我不属于任何党派，”就是指这事说的。
    直至去年五月底为止，我在上海度过十五年孤独的译著生活，解放后，我公开了。现在对于过去这段历史，应该有所声明。
    先就公的方面讲，中国是一个三千多年传统的专制国家，至近百年又逐渐变成半殖民地。因此，中国人民是受了半封建半殖民地的两重压迫。在农村是地主严重的剥削，农民得不到土地，不能解决最低限度的生活问题；在城市是官僚资本家勾结国际帝国主义，操纵我们的经济命脉，扼杀我们的民族工业。要解放中国，本只有反封建反帝国主义的一条革命大道；而农民战争尤应为主力军，一则针对了卖国政府武力不及广大农村的弱点，比较容易解决农民的土地问题；二则在农村中所培养的基本队伍，一经壮大，即能走向城市，推翻卖国政府，廓清帝国主义的势力。
    陈独秀派看不清这种局势，更分不出缓急轻重，一味以所谓“国民会议”为标榜，盲目反对中共的武装革命，甚至诬为“土匪”“流寇”的行动。这的确是取消革命，变成完全反革命的了。
    这一派既不能把握现实，提出为一般人民所能接受的策略，便走入绝境。它的分子于是开始堕落，投入蒋匪帮底下，为其爪牙。直至日本投降，这一派的主要分子之一彭述之还在上海创办两种公开的杂志，用尽“革命”的空话，攻击中共的每一行动，希图混淆是非，蛊惑青年。
    至于我个人，因长期秘密生活的关系，养成了一种偏于读书译著而绝少行动的习惯。我的知识大都是从书本上而不是从实践中得来的。我之所以加入托陈派，原希望中国的工人运动能和西方民主国家的一样，于每次革命失败之后，重新起来争取基本权利，参加以至领导民主运动，借以迎接将来的革命高潮。但我忽视了中国传统的专制政治，和农民斗争的巨大力量，以致取了一条相反的反动的道路。旋因事实的教训，和学说的印证，我才逐渐明了这种情形。同时，我深深感到托陈派局促城市中，自己不行动，专门攻击中共坚决艰苦的行动——这样去帮助敌人，无论如何，是不应该的。于是因一次最后的冲突，我于十六年前宣布退出。但我未能早就认识托陈派的反动性，在退出以后也未能公开宣布与之决裂，是错误的。迨彭述之在一九四六年的“求真”创刊号化名鼓吹老子的学说，并准备将此学说和托洛茨基主义结合（他这样对人扬言）时，我便起来迎头痛击，至再至三，直到他压下我的反攻文字不登为止。
    其次，当二十多年前中国社会史论战时，我曾认周代是封建社会，自秦汉至清是半封建社会。此后虽没有工夫再去研究中国历史，但直至三年前为止，也没有改变自己的意见。因为文献通考的封建考明明说过：“立国曰封，分土曰建。”秦废封建为郡县，自汉至清，大都是分封而不建国的局面，故我称它为半封建。然两年前读西洋史，发现西方国家也常有有无封建之争，我开始注意到封建问题不能单凭字面，甚至也不能单凭一种政治制度去判断，应以社会结构中的实质为衡量。近半年来，我初次看到报纸上所暴露的许许多多农村、矿山、城市的压迫和剥削，还全是封建的，而非资本主义的（把头制度即是一例）。推而上之，秦汉至清自不能称为半封建社会。否则其余的一半是什么？从前总以为是商业资本主义。其实在这个长时期中，外患频仍，一治一乱，一切的一切，大都趋于停顿，商业并不普遍发达，尤其在农村中是如此。何况商业并不能单独构成资本主义，在封建社会，商业上所袭用的压迫和剥削手段，仍然是封建的，而不是什么资本主义的。故自秦汉至清仍然是封建社会。
    举凡有关现实的大问题，常是极端复杂，需要正确的理论和实践配合，经过慎重和长期的考虑，才能决定的。我在二十多年前，凭着青年人的一股勇气，和书本上的片面材料，即贸然加入托陈派，判断中国社会的性质，这是错误的。可是看到了事实的证明，我愿意虚心承认并改正我的错误。
    托派认中国现阶段的革命一开始就是社会主义的（由无产阶级专政），这种主张是荒谬的。我在一九四五年十一月所草“现阶段的民主主义”（登在翌年出版的“求真”创刊号）一文中，承认在无产阶级社会主义革命之前，应经过一个民主主义的阶段（即“现阶段”），在此时期中，农民应分配土地，工人应参加生产的管理等等。总之，我“所要求的民主，不仅是政治的，而且是经济的，社会的。”我完全拥护毛主席所提出的先经过新民主主义革命然后转入社会主义革命的理论。
    现在全国解放将近完成，新民主主义的建设正在开始，我愿诚恳地在中央人民政府和中国共产党的领导之下，站在自己的岗位上，以最大的热忱，为祖国工作。
        一九五○年十一月三日于北京
