    [This newspaper dispatch] To welcome the Nanjing Machine Factory's November scribing work, worker Zhu Shengbao, with the help of the production team leader, used his brain, carefully studied, and, based on the original single-needle scribing disc principle, created a multi-needle scriber. After testing, the production efficiency was more than six times higher than the single-needle scriber, and the line size was also more accurate than the former.
