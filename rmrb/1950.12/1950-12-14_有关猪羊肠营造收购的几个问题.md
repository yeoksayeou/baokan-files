    Several Questions Concerning the Casing Acquisition of Pig and Sheep Intestines

    To the Editor:
    We noticed the price reports for sheep intestines in your newspaper's market section last month. We feel that this production enterprise can help us prepare for famine and earn foreign exchange, which is a win-win situation. No one here is buying sheep intestines, and they are discarded everywhere, which is a real pity. Now, we have some questions about making and selling them, and we would like you to provide instructions:
    1. What is the meaning of sheep intestines 22 fen, 20 fen, and 18 fen?
    2. Is the manufacturing of sheep intestines the same as that of pig intestines? What are the differences?
    3. Where can we find companies that buy sheep intestines?
    4. Can sheep intestines be sent to buyers through the post office? Can the payment be sent by the post office? Can the China Casing Company handle postal business?
    5. Based on your judgment, is there a possibility of stopping the export of this export product in the future?

                                     Li Guoliang, Post Office, Handong Town, Zhengyang County, Henan

    Mr. Li Guoliang: Your questions have been answered by the Intestine Processing Factory of the Beijing Branch of the China Fur and Leather Company as follows:

    (1) Sheep intestines 22 fen, 20 fen, and 18 fen refer to the diameter of the intestines that meet the export standards. 22 fen means 22 millimeters (1000 millimeters per meter), and so on.

    (2) The processing methods for pig and sheep intestines are the same, but the soaking time and the amount of salt used are different. Pig intestines have thicker skin and are not easily scratched. They can be scraped on the same day in summer, but in winter they must be soaked in water for a day before they can be scraped. The scraped intestines are called "raw intestines." In summer, each intestine needs two ounces of salt, and in winter, one and a half ounces of salt. Sheep intestines have thin skin and are easily scratched, so a certain level of skill is required. In summer, the intestines are taken out and soaked in cold water for a day before they can be scraped, but in winter, they must be soaked in cold water for six or seven days before they can be scraped. In summer, each intestine needs three ounces of salt, and in winter, two ounces of salt.

    (3) There are many companies in Tianjin that directly engage in the export of casings, and most of them have branches in Beijing. Currently, there are five private exporters and only our factory as a state-owned enterprise in Beijing. Both public and private intestine merchants are buying casings (both pig and sheep intestines are accepted). Prices are mostly based on the market prices in the People's Daily and Tianjin Daily.

    (4) Our factory is currently short of staff, so it is difficult to handle postal transactions. If you are unfamiliar with the situation or the goods are few and it is inconvenient to come, you can write down the detailed mailing address and send it to the post office, which will handle a few transactions on your behalf. The payment will be sent by the post office, and we will maintain our credit.

    (5) Currently, the prices of casings at home and abroad are rising, and it is estimated that exports will not be stopped. As far as we know, the sheep intestines in your area are too thin and of poor quality. You can send a small sample to see how it is before deciding whether to purchase them.

### 有关猪羊肠营造收购的几个问题

    有关猪羊肠营造收购的几个问题编辑同志：
    上月贵报行情栏见有羊肠价格报道，我们感觉这项生产事业，一则可以帮助我们备荒，二则可以争取外汇，是一举两得的事情。我们这里羊肠无人收购，遍地抛弃实为可惜。现在有些关于营造和出售的问题，请你们予以指示：
    １、羊肠二十二分、二十分、十八分怎样解释？
    ２、羊肠之营造是否与猪肠相同？不同点在那里？
    ３、什么地方有厂商收购羊肠？
    ４、羊肠是否可经邮局寄给买主？货款由邮局寄来。中国肠衣公司是否可以办理邮寄业务？
    ５、这项出口货据你们判断目前有无停止出口可能？
                                河南正阳县寒冻镇邮局  李国梁
    李国梁先生：你的问题，已经中国皮毛分公司北京分公司肠衣加工厂答复如下：
    （一）羊肠二十二分、二十分、十八分系指合于出口标准之粗度直径而言。所谓二十二分即二十二公厘（每公尺为一○○○公厘）余类推。
    （二）猪、羊肠加工方法相同，惟水浸时间长短及用盐数量不一样。猪肠皮厚不易刮破，夏天当日能刮，冬天在水内浸一天后才能刮。刮后为毛肠，夏天每根需用盐二两，冬天用盐一两半；羊肠皮薄易刮破，需有一定的技术才行。夏天将肠取出后在凉水内侵一天后即能刮，冬天须在凉水内浸六、七天以后才能刮。夏天每根用盐三两，冬天用盐二两。
    （三）在天津直接经营出口肠衣者很多，并大部在北京设有分厂。现在北京有私营出口商五家，国营只有我厂一家。公私肠商都在收购肠衣（猪、羊肠均收）价格多根据人民日报和天津日报之行情。
    （四）我厂现因干部缺乏，尚难作到邮寄交易。如因情况不熟或路远货少不便前来时，可写明详细通信处交邮局奇来，代为办理几次尚无问题。货款当交邮局寄去，定保持信用。
    （五）目前肠衣在国内外价格均显上涨，估计不致停止出口。据我们所知你处羊肠过细，且质量较次，你们可少寄点样品来，试试如何，再行决定收购与否。      编者
