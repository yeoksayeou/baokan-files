Xinhua News Agency, December 18th, TASS Moscow, December 16th: Note from the Soviet Government to the United States and British Governments.

On December 15th of this year, the Soviet Ambassadors in Washington and London, acting on the instructions of the Soviet Government, delivered notes to the United States and British governments regarding the issue of handing over Japanese Emperor Hirohito and certain Japanese generals to an international tribunal for trial.

The full text of the note to the United States Government is as follows:

“Ten months ago, on February 1, 1950, the Soviet Government delivered to the United States Government a note regarding the results of the public trial conducted by the Military Tribunal of the Maritime Territory Military District in the city of Khabarovsk from December 25 to 30, 1949, of Japanese war criminals Yamada, Kajitsuka, Kawashima, and others. In this trial, it was proven that the Japanese ruling group, headed by Emperor Hirohito, had secretly prepared bacteriological warfare – a most inhumane weapon of aggression – against the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom for many years.

Based on the facts established by the tribunal, it was pointed out in the note that the testimony of Kajitsuka and Kawashima, participants in the preparation of bacteriological warfare, confirmed that Emperor Hirohito was one of the main participants in the preparation of bacteriological warfare.

According to Hirohito's special secret instructions, the center for the Japanese army's preparation for bacteriological warfare was established in Manchuria, which was then occupied by the Japanese army, to prepare for bacteriological warfare against the Soviet Union, China, the Mongolian People's Republic, and against the armies of the United States and other countries. In the preparation for the implementation of these sinister plans of the Japanese militarists, thousands of people – mainly citizens of China and the Soviet Union – were used for experiments on the effectiveness of lethal bacteria.

In the aforementioned Khabarovsk trial, it was also established that Japanese war criminals, in the execution of their aggressive plans, not only prepared but also repeatedly used bacteriological weapons: in 1939 in the Khalkhin Gol area against the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union; and during the war against China from 1940 to 1942, the Japanese army's bacteriological expeditionary forces caused plague and typhoid epidemics in China.

In the Soviet government's note, it was pointed out that since bacteriological weapons have long been condemned by all civilized nations as the most serious crimes violating the honor and conscience of all peoples, the crimes of Japanese militarists and their main organizers and instigators, Emperor Hirohito, are the most blatant violations of the laws and customs of war, especially the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, prohibiting bacteriological weapons.

According to the Potsdam Declaration signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and China in 1945, and joined by the Soviet Union, it was announced that all war criminals should be severely punished. Moreover, Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Far Eastern Commission's decision of April 3, 1946, also stipulated that the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers should appoint a special international tribunal to try Far Eastern war criminals. Therefore, in its note of February 1, 1950, the Soviet Government suggested to the United States Government, and also to the British Government, that a special international military tribunal be appointed, and that the war criminals who have been accused of committing heinous crimes against humanity – Emperor Hirohito and former Japanese army generals Shiro Ishii, Masazo Kitano, Jiro Wakamatsu, Yukio Kasahara, and others – be handed over to the tribunal for trial.

Despite the long period that has passed since February 1, 1950, and despite the Soviet government's re-submission of a note to the United States government on this issue on May 30th of this year, the United States government has not yet responded to the Soviet government's note of February 1, 1950. This will naturally arouse doubts among broad social strata, who cannot tolerate any indulgence or protection for war criminals who have been accused of preparing and conducting inhumane bacteriological warfare.

The Soviet Government deems it necessary to inform that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has replied, agreeing with the suggestions made in the Soviet Government's note of February 1st of this year.

The Soviet Government is awaiting the United States Government's response to the Soviet Government's note of February 1, 1950, regarding the handing over of Emperor Hirohito and other war criminals identified as preparing for bacteriological warfare and bacteriological weapons to a special military tribunal, in accordance with its obligation to hand over war criminals for trial.”

A copy of the note has been sent to the Government of the People's Republic of China at the same time.

In addition, copies of the aforementioned note have been sent to the governments of the Far Eastern Commission member states: Australia, Burma, the Netherlands, India, Canada, the Philippines, New Zealand, Pakistan, and France.

    苏联政府三度照会美英政府主张审判日细菌战犯裕仁等
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：苏联政府致美国和英国政府的照会。
    今年十二月十五日，苏联驻华盛顿与伦敦的大使，奉苏联政府的训令，将关于把日皇裕仁与某些日本将领交给国际法庭审判问题的照会交给美国和英国政府。
    致美国政府的照会全文如下：
    “十个月以前，即一九五○年二月一日，苏联政府曾将在伯力市滨海军区军事法庭于一九四九年十二月二十五日至三十日所进行公审日本战犯山田、梶塚、川岛及其他等人之结果的照会一件递交美国政府。在这个法庭上，证实了以日皇裕仁为首的日本统治集团，在许多年间曾秘密准备细菌战争——一种最惨无人道的侵略武器——以反对苏联、中国、美国及英国。
    基于该法庭所确定之事实，在此照会中曾指出：由准备细菌战争的参加者梶塚和川岛的口供，证实了日皇裕仁是准备细菌战争的主要参加者之一。
    按照裕仁的特别秘密指示，在当时被日本军队占领的满洲，建立了日本陆军准备细菌战争的中心，以准备对苏联、中国、蒙古人民共和国，并对美国及其他国家的军队进行细菌战。在实施日本军国主义者此等罪恶计划的准备工作当中，曾用数千人——主要的是中、苏两国的公民——作杀人细菌效力的实验。
    在上述的伯力审讯中，同样确定了日本战犯于执行其侵略计划时，不但准备了、而且也屡次地使用了细菌武器：在一九三九年曾在哈尔新——葛尔河地区用来反对蒙古人民共和国和苏联；在一九四○年到一九四二年对中国作战期间，日军细菌远征队使中国发生鼠疫及伤寒传染病。
    在苏联政府的照会中曾指出，由于细菌武器久已遭到各个文明国家谴责为违反各国人民的荣誉与良心的最严重的罪行，日本军国主义者及其主要组织者与鼓舞者日皇裕仁的罪行，是对战争法规及惯例，特别是对一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦禁用细菌武器的议定书的最粗暴的违犯。
    根据一九四五年由美、英、中三国所签署又有苏联参加的波茨坦公告，曾宣布一切战犯应受严厉惩办。而且，一九四六年四月三日远东委员会决议的第五条第八款亦确定盟国最高统帅应委任特别国际法庭以审讯远东战犯。因此，苏联政府在一九五○年二月一日的照会中，向美国政府，同样地也向英国政府建议委任特别国际军事法庭，并将已被检举为犯有对人类的滔天罪行的战争罪犯——日皇裕仁及前日军将领石井四郎、北野政藏、若松次郎、笠原幸雄等交给该法庭审判。
    美国政府不管自一九五○年二月一日以来所经过的漫长时期，也不顾苏联政府于今年五月三十日就此问题向美国政府再次提出照会，直至现在对于苏联政府一九五○年二月一日之照会，均未置答复。这自然也会引起广大社会阶层的疑虑，他们对于已被检举为准备及进行惨无人道的细菌战争的战犯是不能容忍任何纵容及庇护的。
    苏联政府认为必需通知：即中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已答复，同意苏联政府今年二月一日照会中所提的建议。
    苏联政府正等候美国政府按照其所承担将战犯交付审判的义务，对苏联政府一九五○年二月一日关于将日皇裕仁及上述已被确定为准备细菌战争及细菌武器之其他战犯交给特别军事法庭的照会，提出答复。”
    照会的副本已同时送交中华人民共和国政府。
    此外，上述照会之副本已分送远东委员会会员国澳大利亚、缅甸、荷兰、印度、加拿大、菲律宾、新西兰、巴基斯坦和法国政府。
