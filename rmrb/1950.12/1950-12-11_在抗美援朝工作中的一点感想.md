    The American imperialists' aggression against our Taiwan and Korea, and their attempts to expand the war of aggression, threaten our country's security. From the standpoint of patriotism and internationalism, we should resolutely oppose them.
    I am a Chinese person, and I have a responsibility to defend my country. I must do everything in my power to oppose American imperialism. I am a drama worker, and my main task should be to oppose imperialism through the stage. I love world peace, and I want to join with peace-loving people around the world to resist the atrocities of the American imperialists.
    How should we oppose American imperialism through the stage?
    From the perspective of my work in Peking Opera, which is subject to various limitations, I hope to perform more plays that oppose aggression, plays about weak nations striving for independence, plays that express the patriotic spirit of the people, and plays that depict the combat history of female heroes who fought for national independence and freedom. Through these plays, I want to educate myself and educate the audience.
    Outside of the stage, general propaganda, charity performances, and troop support—including for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army—and other work that is beneficial to resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, I feel is something we should also do.
    In order to perform the plays better and do the general propaganda work better, it is very necessary to strengthen our study of current events and our professional studies. The more one understands, the more profoundly one can express, and the stronger the infection will be on the audience.

    在抗美援朝工作中的一点感想
    吴素秋
    美帝侵略我国台湾和朝鲜，并企图扩大侵略战争，威胁我国安全，我们从爱国主义和国际主义的立场，是应该坚决反对的。
    我是一个中国的人民，我有保卫祖国的责任，我必需竭尽全力反对美帝国主义。我是一个戏剧工作者，我主要的应该是通过舞台来反对帝国主义。我是爱好世界和平的，我要和世界爱好和平的人士一同反抗美帝的暴行。
    应该怎样通过舞台来反对美帝国主义呢？
    从受着种种条件限制的我的业务京剧来说，我希望多演反侵略的戏，弱小民族争取独立的戏，表现人民的爱国主义精神的戏，表现为着民族独立自由而战的女英雄们的战斗史实的戏。通过这些戏，来教育自己，教育观众。
    在舞台而外，一般的宣传、义演、劳军——包括中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军——等有利于抗美援朝、保家卫国的工作，我觉得也是我们应当做的。
    为了把戏演得更好，把一般宣传工作做得更好，加强自己的时事学习和业务学习，是非常必要的。自己理解得越多，则越能表现得深刻，对观众的感染力也越强。
