Xinhua News Agency: Qinghai Province, Gonghe County: Since the establishment of the Kazakh township in June of this year, the Kazakh ethnic group in Gonghe County, Qinghai Province, has strengthened its unity with all ethnic groups, and their lives have become very stable. They are gradually embarking on the road to establishing themselves and building their lives. Originally, the Kazakh ethnic group had more than 3,300 households and more than 20,000 people. In 1938, they were expelled from Hami to the Dulan County area of Qinghai by Sheng Shicai, the reactionary ruler of Xinjiang. Afterwards, they were subjected to large-scale massacres by the bandit Ma Bufang. Only 31 households, 134 people, escaped to Gonghe County, living in hunger and cold. After the liberation of Qinghai, the Gonghe County People's Government immediately took in the Kazakh people to work on the pasture, first arranging their lives. Afterwards, it held symposiums of Kazakh people and representative meetings of all ethnic groups, so that the Kazakh compatriots understood the People's Government's ethnic policies and their care for them. At the same time, it patiently persuaded the Kazakh compatriots that the past robberies and vendettas that had occurred with various ethnic groups were entirely caused by the reactionary rule's coercion and instigation, eliminating the estrangement between the Kazakhs and other ethnic groups.

The Gonghe County People's Government, based on the opinions of the Kazakh people, after specific consultations, resettled them near Qabqa, allocated more than 200 mu of land and housing, food, cattle, farm tools, hunting guns, etc., and sent personnel to assist in the establishment of their own township government. The Han, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan compatriots also highly promoted the spirit of national unity, mutual assistance, and friendship, and automatically helped them turn the land and plant grain, and donated 84 shi of food and 80 sheep. The Kazakh compatriots said gratefully: "We now have a home."

    青海省共和县
    哈族与各族亲密团结
    【新华社讯】青海省共和县哈萨克族自本年六月间成立哈萨克乡以来，与各族团结日益加强，生活十分安定，正在逐渐走上成家立业的道路。按哈萨克族原有三千三百余户，两万多人，一九三八年被新疆反动统治者盛世才从哈密驱逐至青海都兰县一带后，又连年遭受马匪步芳大肆屠杀，仅三十一户，一百三十四人漏网逃至共和县境，过着饥寒交迫的生活。青海解放后，共和县人民政府即将该族人民收容在牧场工作，首先安置他们的生活，其后又召开哈族人民座谈会及各族人民代表会议，使哈族同胞了解人民政府的民族政策以及对他们的关怀，同时耐心说服哈族同胞，过去与各族曾经发生抢劫仇杀事件，完全是反动统治逼迫挑拨所致，消除了哈族与各族之间的隔阂。
    共和县人民政府根据哈族人民意见，经过具体协商后，把他们安置在恰卜恰附近，拨给二百多亩土地和住房、食粮、耕牛、农具、猎枪等，并派员协助建立哈族人民自己的乡政权。汉族、蒙族、回族、藏族各族同胞也高度地发扬了民族团结、互助、友爱的精神，自动帮助他们翻地种粮并捐出食粮八十四市石、羊八十只。哈胞感激地说：“我们如今有家了。”
