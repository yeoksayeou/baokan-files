To facilitate registration, the bureau has decided that starting today (the 15th), dog owners do not need to bring their dogs when registering; rabies vaccinations will be administered by the Public Health Bureau in various districts according to the dog owners' residences. Furthermore, the date for the Sanitation Engineering Bureau's capture of outdoor dogs has also been postponed by one week from the 16th of this month and will now begin on the 23rd of this month.
