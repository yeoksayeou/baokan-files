    Flourishing Business of the Bank of China
    First Session of the Third Board of Directors Held in Beijing
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Bank of China held its first session of the third board of directors in Beijing on the 9th of this month.

    Gong Yinbing, General Manager of the Bank of China, gave a business report at the meeting covering the eight months since the first session of the second board of directors. In his report, he pointed out that due to the correctness of the policies of the Central People's Government, the development of the domestic economy, the leadership and assistance of the People's Bank of China, and the efforts of colleagues at home and abroad, the business has greatly developed. Domestically, from January to September, export settlement of exchange reached 99 percent of the annual plan, remittances from overseas Chinese reached 92 percent, and foreign exchange deposits and withdrawals reached 79 percent. Regarding overseas branches, all businesses have increased several times to dozens of times compared with before April. Generally, they have turned from losses to profits.

    The meeting approved important matters such as the bank's interim summary account for the first half of the year (totaling a net profit of over 33.6 billion RMB), the interim measures for the appointment and removal of the bank's staff, the measures for the bank to issue letters of authorization to responsible personnel of overseas branches and personnel representing the head office to perform special tasks, and five new principles on further developing the business of overseas branches.

    After listening to the report of General Manager Gong Yinbing, the directors present believed that the progress of overseas business should be attributed to the correct leadership policies of the head office and the strong support of domestic branches in terms of funds and business. The hard work of the responsible persons and all colleagues in overseas branches is particularly commendable, and it was decided by the board of directors to send letters of慰勉 (condolence/solicitation) separately.

    A total of twenty-three public and private directors of the bank, twenty attended the meeting: Nan Hanchen, Hu Jingyun, Sha Qianli, Zhang Hanfu, Song Hanzhang, Chen Guangfu, Li Ming, Bei Zugui, Zheng Tieru, Zhang Naiqi, Gong Yinbing, Ma Yinchu, Ji Chaoding, Zhan Wu, Jin Runquan, Xu Jiyin, Wang Shao'ao, Cao Juru, Sun Xiaocun, and Du Yuesheng. Among them, Ma Yinchu, Chen Guangfu, Song Hanzhang, Li Ming, Bei Zugui, Du Yuesheng, and Xu Jiyin were unable to attend in person due to illness or other matters and were represented by other directors.

    中国银行业务发达  
    首届三次董事会在京举行
    【新华社讯】中国银行已于本月九日在北京举行第一届第三次董事会。
    中国银行总经理龚饮冰在会上作了自第一届第二次董事会后八个月来的业务报告。他在报告中指出：由于中央人民政府政策的正确，国内经济的发展，人民银行的领导与协助，以及全行国内外同仁的努力，业务已有了很大的发展。国内方面，一至九月份出口结汇完成全年计划的百分之九十九，侨汇完成百分之九十二，存兑外汇外币完成百分之七十九。国外行处方面，所有业务都较四月份以前增加数倍以至数十倍。一般已由亏损转为盈余。
    会议通过了该行本年上期总结算（计纯益人民币三百三十六亿余元），该行工作人员任免暂行办法，该行颁发国外行处负责人员及代表总处执行特别任务人员授权书办法，关于进一步开展国外行处业务的五条新原则等要案。
    与会董事在听取总经理龚饮冰的报告后，认为海外业务的进展，除应归因于总处领导政策的正确和国内行处在资金上、业务上的大力支持外，国外行处负责人与全体同仁等之艰苦奋斗尤属难能可贵，特决议由董事会分别去函慰勉。
    该行全体公私董事共二十三人，出席此次会议的为：南汉宸、胡景澐、沙千里、章汉夫、宋汉章、陈光甫、李铭、贝祖诒、郑铁如、章乃器、龚饮冰、马寅初、冀朝鼎、詹武、金润泉、徐寄廎、王绍鏊、曹菊如、孙晓村、杜月笙等二十人。其中马寅初、陈光甫、宋汉章、李铭、贝祖诒、杜月笙、徐寄廎七人因病或因事未能亲自出席，系委托其他董事代表。
