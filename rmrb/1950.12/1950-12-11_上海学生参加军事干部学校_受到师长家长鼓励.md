    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th—The glorious action of Shanghai's young students participating in various military cadre schools has not only been universally respected and supported by teachers and classmates but also encouraged by their parents. Teachers in various schools are encouraging their beloved students at various gatherings to take up the glorious posts of patriotic youth. One hundred and forty-two professors from Jiaotong University jointly issued a letter to the students, encouraging them to actively participate in military schools and become outstanding cadres in national defense construction. Luo Shuru, a member of the Shanghai Women's Federation, has encouraged her five children to sign up to defend the motherland. Zhao Fuxin, a physics professor at Jiaotong University, had sheltered his son's revolutionary activities before liberation. After Shanghai's liberation, he asked his son to continue his studies, hoping to cultivate him into a chemical engineer. Now, he is asking his son to apply to a military school. Professor Zhao Fuxin said: Without strong national defense construction, it is impossible to carry out other construction. It is wrong to reject serving the most urgent needs of the country and the people in order to obtain a school diploma. Pan Chengliang, a professor of civil engineering at Jiaotong University who studied in the United States, earnestly instructed his son, Pan Junrui, to participate in a military school. He said: If students from Jiaotong University have made contributions to transportation construction in the past, I hope that students from Jiaotong University can make the same contributions to the cause of national defense construction in the future. Shi Ruili, a professor at Shanghai Maritime College, also encouraged his son, who is studying at Bile Middle School, to participate in military school. Feng Zhongwen, a student at Bile Middle School, lost his father after he was killed by an American imperialist jeep. He was also encouraged by his mother and determined to participate in military school to avenge his father. His mother, Shen Ruili, wrote in the souvenir album she gave him: "I give this beloved souvenir album to my beloved son. I hope you will study hard and work hard to build a new China and defend world peace."
    As of the 7th, more than 1,800 students from various schools have signed up.

    上海学生参加军事干部学校
    受到师长家长鼓励
    【新华社上海八日电】上海青年学生参加各种军事干部学校的光荣行动，不仅普遍受到师长、同学的尊敬和拥戴，同时受到父母的鼓励。各校的教师都在各种集会上勉励自己心爱的学生站到爱国青年的光荣岗位上去。交通大学一百四十二位教授联名发表告同学书，鼓励他们积极参加军事学校，做一个国防建设上的优秀干部。上海家庭妇联会员罗漱如，为了保卫祖国，已鼓励她的五个儿女报名。交通大学物理系教授赵富鑫在解放前曾掩护他儿子的革命活动，上海解放后，他曾要求他的儿子继续升学，希望培养他成为一个化学工程师。现在，他要求自己的儿子投考军事学校。赵富鑫教授说：没有强大的国防建设，要进行其他的建设是不可能的。为了要得到一张学校毕业的文凭，而拒绝了为祖国为人民最迫切需要而服务是不应该的。交通大学土木系留美教授潘承梁谆谆嘱咐他的儿子潘君瑞参加军事学校。他说：如果过去交大的学生在交通建设上有所贡献的话，我希望以后交大的学生能同样在国防建设事业上有贡献。上海航务学院教授施瑞履也鼓励他在比乐中学读书的儿子参加军校。比乐中学学生冯忠文的父亲是被美帝国主义的吉普车撞死的。他也得到母亲的勉励，决心参加军事学校，为父亲复仇。他母亲沈瑞丽在送给他的纪念册上写道：“我以心爱的纪念册送给我心爱的儿子。希望你加紧学习，为建设新中国保卫世界和平而努力。”
    各校学生截至七日为止，已有一千八百余人报名。
