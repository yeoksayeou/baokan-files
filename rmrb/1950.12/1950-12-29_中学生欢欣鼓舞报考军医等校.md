Middle School Students Cheerfully Enlist in Military Medical and Other Schools
[This Newspaper's Dispatch] After seeing the notice from the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission regarding the recruitment of students for military medical, logistics, communications, public security, foreign affairs, and Russian language schools, students in various middle schools in Beijing once again launched a wave of enthusiasm in response to the call of the motherland. Many students from Girls' No. 1 Middle School and Boys' No. 2 Middle School, etc., jumped for joy upon seeing this news. Students who were just sixteen years old and in the first year of junior high school happily exclaimed, "This time, it's my turn!" Those whose initial applications were not approved submitted second applications one after another. Students from Chongshi Middle School wrote letters of determination one after another. A second-year high school student named Wang Qilie, who wanted to apply to a military medical school, wrote in his letter of determination: "I am determined to learn the spirit of Dr. Bethune!" Students from the Affiliated High School of Normal University who were not approved to join the navy, army, and air force schools expressed one after another: "In order to ensure the supply and medical care for the front lines, we must sign up to join military medical, logistics, and other schools." Hebei Provincial Normal School, No. 7 Middle School, Girls' No. 2 Middle School, Girls' No. 3 Middle School, Chongci Girls' Middle School, Xinying, and Pingmin and other schools are enthusiastically signing up; at Beijing Normal University, 120 people had already signed up in two hours on the afternoon of the 27th; at the Affiliated High School of Normal University, 150 people had signed up on the 27th.
