Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 4th: In the Northwest Region, with the exception of areas in Guanzhong region and individual counties in Gansu and Ningxia that are implementing land reform, and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, the vast rural areas, including one hundred counties and cities with a population of ten million, will mobilize peasants this winter and next spring to carry out rent reduction. This large-scale movement against local bullies and rent reduction is now gradually unfolding.

In August of this year, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, based on the spirit of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and combined with the actual conditions in the rural areas of the Northwest Region, promulgated rent reduction measures. The people's governments of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces successively convened people's representative conferences at all levels to discuss and approve detailed implementation rules and work steps suitable for various different situations. In September, Shaanxi Province first conducted trials in 154 townships in fifteen counties in the Han River basin. By the end of September, the number of peasants participating in the anti-hegemony and rent reduction movement had reached more than 300,000. According to statistics from four districts in Nanzheng County alone, peasants had legally reduced more than 19,600 *shi* of grain from landlords. At the same time, the trial rent reduction in sixty-two townships in the Tianshui Special District of Gansu Province has also successfully concluded; more than 8,500 tenant farmers have reduced 8,500 *shi* of overpaid rent grain and signed new lease contracts with landlords in accordance with the rent reduction regulations. Now, rent reduction is unfolding in a wide area. In areas that have undergone anti-hegemony and rent reduction struggles, the forces of feudal bullies have suffered heavy blows, and the superior strength of the peasants has been initially established. Peasant associations and militia organizations are gradually expanding. The number of members of peasant associations in the southern counties of Shaanxi has grown to more than 230,000.

    大规模反霸减租运动
    已在西北区逐步展开
    【新华社西安四日电】西北区各省，除关中地区和甘肃、宁夏个别县实行土地改革的地区，和少数民族聚居的地区而外，广大农村包括一百个县、市，一千万人口的地区，都将在今冬明春发动农民，进行减租。现在这个大规模的反恶霸和减租的运动已逐渐展开。
    今年八月间，西北军政委员会根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的精神，并结合西北地区农村的实际情况，颁布减租办法后，陕西、甘肃、宁夏、青海等省人民政府都曾先后召开各界人民代表会议，讨论并通过了适合于各种不同情况的减租实施细则和工作步骤。九月，陕西省即首先在汉水流域地区十五个县的一百五十四个乡进行试办。到九月底统计时，参加反恶霸和减租运动的农民，就已达三十多万人。仅据当时南郑县四个区的统计，农民已从地主手中，依法减回地主租粮一万九千六百多石。同时，甘肃省天水专区也有六十二个乡的试办减租已胜利结束；八千五百多佃农，共减回多缴的租粮八千五百石，并按照减租条例向地主订立了新租约。现在各地减租正在向广大地区展开。已经过反恶霸和减租斗争的地区，封建恶霸势力已遭受沉重的打击，农民的优势力量，已初步建立起来。农民协会和民兵组织都在逐渐扩大。陕西南部各县农民协会会员已发展到二十三万多人。
