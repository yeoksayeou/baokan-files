    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 7th: TASS reports: A delegation of Chinese social leaders and cultural workers, led by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, arrived in Moscow on the 6th to attend the Second World Peace Congress. Welcoming the Chinese representatives at the Kiev Railway Station in Moscow were: V.S. Kemenov, Chairman of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, and several members of the Chinese delegation who arrived in Moscow a week earlier. Wang Jiaxiang, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union, and embassy staff also went to welcome them.
    Guo Moruo, head of the delegation, told a TASS reporter that the Warsaw Congress showed the world that the forces fighting for peace have greatly increased. The Congress demonstrated that the growing peace movement is more powerful than any atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, germ weapons, and other kinds of weapons. The delegates attending the congress, united under a great goal, have shown great enthusiasm and determination to defend peace against the aggression of aggressors. Guo Moruo also said that we—the representatives of the Chinese people—are particularly gladdened and encouraged by this unity. Our proposals for defending peace have been adopted into the various resolutions of the Congress. We are fully satisfied that the wishes of the 500 million Chinese people have received the unanimous support of all participants in the Congress.
    Guo Moruo concluded by saying that the Congress, attended by many writers, scientists, musicians, journalists, and actors, has proven that progressive intellectuals in various countries are a fighting force in the army of peace. The resolutions of the Congress are a program for the creative activities of writers and journalists. Their sharp pens will become invincible weapons against warmongers.
