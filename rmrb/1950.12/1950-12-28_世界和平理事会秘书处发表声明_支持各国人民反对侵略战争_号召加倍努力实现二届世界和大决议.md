Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 24th, TASS: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council (formerly translated as the World Peace Defense Committee) recently issued a statement saying: "At the meeting on the 21st, the Secretariat of the World Peace Council learned of the initial achievements of peace fighters in various countries in carrying out the resolutions of the Second World Peace Congress. The Secretariat has studied the reports sent by the National Peace Committees. Truman's recent statement and the resolutions passed in Brussels by the North Atlantic Treaty countries to recognize and continue the large-scale armament of West Germany have aroused discontent and anger everywhere. The Secretariat agrees with the initiative shown in various places and calls on all peace-defending organizations in various countries to redouble their efforts to fight against war, against war propaganda, and to implement the regulations formulated by the Second World Peace Defense Congress."
    The statement finally announced that the plenary meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council will be held on January 10, 1951.
