    We Must Win Peace Through the Struggle Against Aggression
    Huang Dengming

    In July 1948, entrusted by the workers of the South, I traveled from the distant South to Harbin, Northeast China, to participate in the Sixth National Labor Congress. As a result, I passed through northern Korea and stayed in Pyongyang, the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, for several days.

    There, I saw the Korean working class, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, building their country with unparalleled labor enthusiasm and living a happy life. The Korean people not only loved their leader, General Kim Il-sung, but I also saw the portraits of the great revolutionary teacher of the world's people, Marshal Stalin, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, hanging in factories, schools, stations, and public places. This fully demonstrates the patriotism and internationalism of the Korean working class, and also illustrates the inseparable security relationship between China, the Soviet Union, and Korea, which are geographically as close as lips and teeth, in defending peace and opposing wars of aggression.

    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people have achieved great victories. The People's Republic of China has made brilliant achievements in the past year. Our working class is using unparalleled labor enthusiasm to restore and develop production, striving for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, and working hard for a bright future for our workers' lives.

    The American imperialists have not learned a lesson from their failure in supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the mortal enemy of the Chinese working class, and have not abandoned their ambition to invade China. On the contrary, they have unreasonably invaded our Taiwan, bombed our Northeast, killing and wounding many of our worker brothers. American warships have invaded our territorial waters, killing and wounding many of our fishermen. These bloody facts make our working class extremely angry. Blood debts must be repaid in blood.

    Before the Chinese delegation attended the Second World Peace Congress, the US imperialists were frantically invading Korea, massacring the Korean people, and turning peaceful Korean cities into rubble and ashes. The fanatical American aggressors even crossed the 38th parallel, attempting to annex the entire Korea, and following the old path of the Japanese imperialists, attempting to further invade China.

    The continuous victories of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side in Korea against American aggression and in defense of peace have shattered the American imperialists' wild schemes. When I heard this news while attending the meeting in Warsaw, I was very excited and wished I could immediately grow wings and fly back to my motherland to sign up for the People's Volunteers and go to the Korean front to wipe out the American aggressors.

    The great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in Korea against American aggression and in defense of peace has inspired the peace-loving people of the world. It also points out that peace cannot be waited for; peace must be won through struggle.

    我们要从反对侵略斗争中赢得和平
    黄灯明
    一九四八年七月，我受着南方工人的委托，从遥远的南方到东北哈尔滨市参加全国第六次劳动代表大会，因此我路经朝鲜北部，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国临时首都平壤住了好几天。
    我在那里看见了朝鲜的工人阶级在金日成将军领导下，以无比的劳动热忱建设自己的国家，过着愉快的生活。朝鲜的人民不但热爱自己的领袖金日成将军，同时我还看见了世界人民革命导师斯大林大元帅和中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的像，也挂在工厂、学校、车站、公共场所中；这充分表现着朝鲜工人阶级的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，也说明中国、苏联、朝鲜，在地理上唇齿相依的安危关系，在保卫和平，反对侵略战争是分不开的。
    在毛主席英明领导下，中国工人阶级和中国人民已取得伟大的胜利。中华人民共和国一年来取得了辉煌的成就，咱们工人阶级正要用无比的劳动热忱来恢复与发展生产，为争取财经状况基本好转而斗争，为咱们工人生活的美好将来而努力。
    美帝国主义者没有从支援中国工人阶级死敌的蒋介石匪帮遭到失败接受教训而放弃侵略中国的野心，相反地，它更无理地侵略我国台湾，轰炸我国东北，杀死杀伤我们许多工人兄弟，美国军舰侵入我领海，杀死杀伤我国许多渔民。这些血的事实，使我们工人阶级万分愤怒。血债是要血来偿还的。
    在中国和大代表团出席第二届保卫世界和平大会之前，美帝正在疯狂侵略朝鲜，屠杀朝鲜人民，使朝鲜的和平城市变成瓦砾与灰烬。疯狂的美国侵略者并越过三八线，企图吞并整个朝鲜，并步着日本帝国主义者的老路，企图进而侵略中国。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜并肩作战，反对美帝侵略、保卫和平的不断胜利，粉碎了美帝的狂妄阴谋。我在华沙开会时听到这个消息，非常兴奋，恨不能立刻身生双翅，飞回祖国，报名参加人民志愿军，开到朝鲜前线去，歼灭美国侵略军。
    中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军，在朝鲜反对美帝侵略保卫和平的伟大胜利，鼓舞了世界爱好和平的人民。也指出和平是不能坐待的，和平是要从斗争中争取的。
            一九五○年十二月二十七日
