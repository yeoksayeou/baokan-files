    Fighting on the Shores of Changjin Lake
    By Our Special Correspondent Li Zhuang

    Changjin Lake is a beautiful lake in North Korea; today, its surroundings have become a graveyard for the American invading army.

    A severe cold of thirty degrees below zero Celsius fiercely assaults the mountains and ridges of North Korea. Everything is frozen. Heavy snow covers the grim rocks. The branches of deciduous trees tremble in the cold wind. The somber pine trees issue heavy roars in the cold wind. Only Changjin Lake and Fuzhan Lake have not yet frozen;阵阵 of white mist rises from the green lake water. Every dawn,团团 white mist rises from the lake surface. The American invading army often begins their aggressive attacks in the morning.

    Changjin Lake borders the Yalu River to the north; an spearhead of the American invading army points directly at our country's border defenses from here. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the aggressors continuing to run rampant here. Therefore, on the south bank of the Yalu River, in the North Korean mountains, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is conducting arduous and heroic resistance here.

    The American invaders' planes swarm across the sky during the day; the heavy drone of engines disturbs the peaceful sky of Korea. Incendiary bombs are constantly dropped on the lovable villages; the suffering of the Korean people is increasing every moment. Old hatreds are compounded by new grievances.

    Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army's steel warriors, who love their motherland and deeply sympathize with the Korean people, move in and out of the endless mountains of Korea. The heavy Siberian cold current cannot cool the hearts of our steel warriors. In the snow and ice trenches, the soldiers sit and lie on the frozen ground; some eat potatoes and snowballs with ice fragments, but they do not complain. They know that if they want to defend their beloved motherland, they must carry out an anti-aggression campaign under such difficult conditions.

    All hatred is directed at the enemy. The soldiers often hold free-talking meetings in the trenches to study the significance of resisting America and aiding Korea, and to analyze the current situation and future of the American "paper tiger." Everyone looks down on the American invading army, but everyone also warns each other not to underestimate the enemy. Many soldiers hand in letters of determination to the political instructor, striving to perform meritorious service on the front lines, hoping to be admitted to the Communist Party as a result.

    On the North Korean front, battles are frequent.

    On November 28th, a day-long battle took place on a small mountain south of Xinxing-ri, southeast of Changjin Lake. On the night of the 27th, a unit of the Volunteer Army had liberated this small mountain, pushing the enemy down the mountain. The enemy began a counterattack the next day. The winter nights in Korea are long; at 6:30 a.m. on the 28th, the night had not completely lifted, the soldiers were fighting the cold wind on the mountain, and the enemy's air raid began. Sixteen planes came at once, of all types. The soldiers lay in the bomb shelters, and when they saw the two "Black Widow" type planes with black fuselages, the soldiers said: "They're here to pay respects!" Some soldiers had some experience with "Black Widows" in the past. Because when the "Black Widow" comes, it means the enemy is about to be defeated. After the American planes bombed wildly for a while, the infantry assault began. Our People's Volunteer Army soldiers calmly prepared, and when the enemy approached, they threw a row of grenades, picked up their bayonets, and engaged the enemy in close combat. The planes and artillery that the enemy usually relied on were completely ineffective at this time. So, they collapsed.

    From 6:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., the enemy "counterattacked" more than ten times. Most of the two squads of soldiers who were originally on the mountain were killed or wounded, and the battalion's secretary, bugler, and medics all joined the battle. Soldiers Li Shudi and medic Zhao Mingyi, who participated in this battle, told reporters: "We are the Volunteer Army resisting America and aiding Korea, and we must never let the enemy's counterattack succeed. They rely on planes to fight, but on the front line, in close combat, planes are of no use at all." When Zhao Mingyi attacked the enemy's "counterattack," he took grenades from the bodies of the martyred heroes and from the hands of wounded comrades, and threw them fiercely at the enemy. During the intervals of the plane's bombing, he ran back and forth to rescue the wounded. A little after eleven o'clock, a jet enemy plane swooped down on him. He seemed to have been pushed over, his left hand was numb, and his nerves vibrated violently. But when he came to his senses, he carried a soldier with a chest wound to the aid station. At this time, he realized that one of his sleeves was cold and stiff; it turned out that his left arm had been wounded and the blood had frozen.

    The black night, the stars and the crescent moon illuminated the snowy mountain road, and countless people flowed toward the enemy. Obviously, on the Korean battlefield, the days of counterattack had arrived. During the day, the soldiers resolutely held the captured positions. At night, the soldiers launched new, relentless attacks on the enemy. In the vast mountains, wherever there were enemies, there were also us; everywhere was the sound of gunfire and shouts of killing. The enemy planes circled anxiously in the sky, which, in the soldiers' words, was just "whining blindly." The enemy's artillery was also hoarse at night - unable to choose a firing target. The soldiers carried light automatic weapons and advanced toward the enemy with all their bodies on fire.

    Liutan-ri is an example of a night battle.

    Liutan-ri is close to Changjin Lake. The mountains north of the lake had been trampled on by the American army. Starting on November 27th, our People's Volunteer Army fought for every mountain, compressing the enemy into Liutan-ri. This small village of a dozen households was crammed with over a thousand enemies, over a hundred vehicles, and over twenty tanks. The cowardly enemies drove all the tanks around the village, making them mobile machine gun nests and bunkers; they were determined to hold Liutan-ri and wait for an opportunity to break out.

    The "opportunity to break out" did come. The American soldiers discovered a "gap" in the southwest direction and immediately abandoned all supplies and fled wildly to the southwest. This "gap" was arranged by a command of our People's Volunteer Army. Various obstacles were placed on the road, which was steep and slippery, making it difficult for vehicles to travel. From 11:00 a.m. on December 1st to 2:00 a.m. on the 2nd, these American invading troops in cars only traveled fifteen li. Fifteen li away was a gentle, tree-filled mountain stream, where a unit of the Volunteer Army had already dug graves for the enemy.

    A unit of soldiers, led by Deputy Battalion Commander Pan, arrived at this dilapidated village three hours after the enemy fled Liutan-ri. This group of enemies fled so hastily that they did not have time to burn down the houses. The streets of Liutan-ri were piled with artillery, gasoline, vehicles, and unburied enemy corpses. Cigarettes and canned goods were everywhere. The soldiers did not have time to clean up the resource-rich battlefield and continued to pursue the enemy fiercely.

    These soldiers, who had fought for many days, were parallel racing with the enemy. The soldiers often had to advance in roadless ridges and mountain streams. The jungle tore clothes and faces, and fresh blood froze on skin that had not been washed for a long time. Everyone did not know how many times they fell, rolling into snowballs. Heavy machine guns sometimes slipped from unconscious hands into the mountain stream.

    When our platoon arrived fifteen li away, it was cutting off half of the enemy's motorcade. The battle began, and the soldiers first destroyed an enemy tank that was acting as cover, and the dead tank blocked the narrow mountain road in Korea. At this time, all of our firepower was concentrated on the enemy, and the enemy's vehicles burst into flames. The so-called "spoiled children of heaven" of the Marine Corps First Division, who claimed to have been in the army for one hundred and sixty years, were immediately thrown into chaos. The enemy did not dare to get out of the vehicles at this time, and only blindly fired six-zero mortars and machine guns very far beyond our soldiers, while frantically shouting in panic.

    In the clear moonlight of the crescent moon, three or four enemy planes flew in from the south. The American soldiers on the ground immediately fired a string of signal flares, indicating that the following were "our own people," and the enemy planes flew away helplessly. The soldiers concentrated on throwing bombs and shooting at the huge motorcade. Half an hour later, the mountain stream showed true silence. This platoon bravely destroyed more than thirty enemy vehicles and four tanks; killed more than two hundred and seventy American soldiers and captured thirty. Our People's Volunteer Army had only one seriously injured and three slightly injured.

    Now, the Korean front is gradually moving south. If the American imperialist invading army does not withdraw from Korea, then the warmer south will be more conducive to the operations of our Volunteer Army resisting America and aiding Korea. (Attached picture)

### 战斗在长津湖畔

    战斗在长津湖畔
    本报特派记者  李庄
    长津湖是北朝鲜美丽的湖泊，今天，它的周围，已变成美国侵略军的坟场。
    零下三十度的严寒，酷烈地侵袭北朝鲜的崇山峻岭。一切都冰冻了。大雪盖在严峻的岩石上。落叶树的枝杈在冷风中发抖。苍色的松树在寒风中发出沉重的吼声。只有长津湖和赴战湖还没有结冰，绿色的湖水中，冒出阵阵的白气。每天的拂晓，团团白雾从湖面上升起来。美国侵略军经常在早晨开始他们的侵略进攻。
    长津湖北临鸭绿江，美国侵略军的一个矛头，从这里直指我们祖国的边防。中国人民绝对不能容忍侵略者在这里继续猖狂。因此，鸭绿江南岸，北朝鲜丛山中，中国人民志愿军一部，在这里进行着艰苦卓绝的英勇的抵抗。
    美国侵略者的飞机白天成群结队地在天空中横行，重浊的马达声扰乱着朝鲜和平的天空。烧夷弹不断投向可爱的村庄，朝鲜人民的苦难，每时每刻都在增加着。旧恨添上新仇。
    热爱自己祖国、深切同情朝鲜人民的我国人民志愿军钢铁战士们，在朝鲜的连绵无尽的山峦间进出。西伯利亚的沉重的寒流，冷却不了我们钢铁战士的心。在冰雪的战壕里，战士们坐卧在冰冻的土地上，有些人吃着带着冰碴的马铃薯和雪团，但是，他们没有怨恨。他们知道，如果要保卫可爱的祖国，就不能不在这样困难条件下进行反侵略的进军。
    一切仇恨都指向敌人。战士们在战壕中经常开漫谈会，研究抗美援朝的意义，分析美国这个“纸老虎”的现状和前途。大家都看不起美国侵略军，但是，大家又相诫不要轻敌。许多战士把决心书交给指导员，争取在火线上立功，希望能够因此被吸收加入共产党。
    北朝鲜的前线，战斗是频繁的。
    十一月二十八日，在长津湖东南的新兴里以南的一个小山上，进行着一个白天的战斗。二十七日夜里，志愿军某部曾经解放了这座小山，把敌人压到山下去了。敌人在第二天开始反攻。朝鲜的冬夜是漫长的，二十八日上午六时半，夜幕还未完全扯开，战士们正在山上和寒风搏斗，敌机的袭击就开始了。一来就是十六架，各种类型都有。战士们躺在避弹坑里，看到两个机身的“黑寡妇”型飞机，战士们就说：“这是来吊孝的！”有些战士，在过去对“黑寡妇”有些经验。因为，“黑寡妇”来，就表示敌军快败了。美国的飞机狂炸一阵之后，就开始了步兵的冲击。我人民志愿军战士们沉着准备，等敌人接近时，投出一排手榴弹，就端起刺刀，和敌人进行白刃战。敌人平素仗恃的飞机和大炮，此时完全失掉作用了。于是，他们溃退了。
    从上午六时半到十二时，敌人“反击”十几次。原来留在山上的两个班的战士大部分伤亡了，营部的书记、司号员、卫生员都投入战斗。参加这次战斗的战士李树弟和卫生员赵明毅对记者说：“我们是抗美援朝的志愿军，绝不能叫敌人反击成功。他们是凭飞机打仗，但是，在第一线，在近战中，飞机根本没有什么用处。”赵明毅在打击敌人的“反击”时，从牺牲的烈士身上，从负伤的同志手中，拿过手榴弹，狂烈地向敌人投去。在飞机轰炸的间歇时，他又跑来跑去地抢救伤员。十一点多钟，一架喷气式敌机向他俯冲而来。他这时似乎被人推了一跤，左手发麻，神经激烈地震动了一下。但是，当他清醒过来之后，他又把一个胸部中弹的战士背到救护所。这时候，他才发现自己一个袖子冰凉僵硬，原来是左臂已经负伤，血已经结冰了。
    黑夜，繁星和弯月照亮积雪的山路，无数人流涌向敌人。很显然，在朝鲜战场上，反攻的日子已经到了。白天，战士们坚决守住已得的阵地。夜里，战士们向敌人进行新的、无情的攻击。在苍茫的群山中，有敌人的地方也就有我们，到处都是枪炮与喊杀的声音。敌人的飞机焦急地在天空盘旋，用战士们的话说，不过只是“瞎哼哼”。敌人的大炮在夜间也嘶哑了——无法选择射击目标。战士们携带着轻快的自动火器，全身火热地向敌人前进。
    柳潭里就是一个夜战的例子。
    柳潭里紧靠着长津湖。湖北群山，曾被美军践踏。从十一月二十七日开始，我国人民志愿军逐山争夺，把敌人压缩到柳潭里。这个十几户人家的小村庄，拥塞着千余敌人、百多辆汽车、二十几辆坦克。怯懦的敌人把全部坦克开到村的周围，作成活动的机关枪巢和地堡，他们决心固守柳潭里，等待突围的机会。
    “突围的机会”果然到来了。美国兵发现西南方向出现了一个“缺口”，立即抛弃全部辎重，向西南狂奔。这个“缺口”是我国人民志愿军某指挥部布置的。公路上摆着各种障碍物，路陡而滑，车行不便。从十二月一日上午十一时到二日晨二时，这些坐着汽车的美国侵略军，只走了十五里。十五里处是一个迂缓多树的山涧，志愿军某部早在那里给敌人掘好了坟墓。
    某部战士在潘副营长率领下，在敌人逃出柳潭里三小时后，赶到这个破烂市一样的村庄。这股敌人逃得这样仓卒，以致没有来得及烧掉房子。柳潭里街上堆满大炮、汽油、车辆和未及掩埋的敌兵尸体。纸烟、罐头到处皆是。战士们来不及打扫物资丰富的战场，一直向敌人猛追下去。
    这些奋战多日的战士们是和敌人平行竞走。战士们常常要在没有路的岗峦和山涧中前进。丛林撕破衣服和手脸，鲜血冻在长期未能洗濯的皮肤上。每个人都不知道跌了多少跤，浑身滚成雪团。重机枪也有时从失掉知觉的手上滑到山涧中。
    我们一个排的队伍赶到十五里处时，正切着敌人的汽车队一半。战斗开始了，战士们首先击毁敌人一辆担任掩护的坦克，死坦克阻绝了狭仄的朝鲜山间的公路。这时我们全部火力都向敌人集中射击，敌人的汽车燃起熊熊大火。自称建军一百六十年的所谓“天之骄子”的海军陆战队第一师的部队，立刻混乱了。敌人这时根本不敢下车，仅以超越我们战士很远的六○炮和机枪盲目射击，同时惊慌失措地狂叫起来。
    在弯月的清白的微光中，从南方飞来三、四架敌机。地面上的美国兵立刻射出一串信号弹，表示下面是“自己人”，敌机无可奈何地飞走了。战士们集中地向庞大的汽车队投弹、射击。半点钟以后，山涧表现了真正的静寂。这一个排英勇地击毁了敌人三十多辆汽车，四辆坦克；击毙二百七十多个美国兵，俘虏三十人。我国人民志愿军只有一个重伤，三个轻伤。
    现在，朝鲜战线逐步南移，如果美帝国主义的侵略军不撤出朝鲜，则比较暖和的南方，将更利于我抗美援朝志愿军的作战。（附图片）
