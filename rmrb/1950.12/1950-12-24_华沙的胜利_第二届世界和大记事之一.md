    The Victory of Warsaw
    —One of the Two Great Events of the World
    By our reporter accompanying the Great Congress delegation, Yuan Shuipai
    Before you flicker various colors and styles of clothing: red scarves and green tops of the Youth League members, butterfly-shaped white bonnets of nuns, turbans of Syrian Muslims, light shawls of Pakistani women, colorful pleated skirts of Polish peasant women, bulky black robes of Catholic priests, white miters and jeweled gold crosses hanging on the chests of Roman Orthodox bishops... Workers from Latin America with light gray skin come and talk to you, young men from South Africa with spiral curls and ink-black faces come and shake your hand. There are people from the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Britain, America, France, and Italy, whom you have seen more often, and there are people from the Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast, Senegal, and Mauritius in Africa, whom you have never seen or even heard of. Different racial face shapes and skin colors: white, yellow, brown, light gray, and deep black... In the last two days before the opening, planes roared continuously in the skies of Poland and Czechoslovakia, carrying more than a thousand delegates to the Second World Peace Congress. Among them, some crossed half the globe, some traveled over mountains and rivers, and some broke through one sealed border and “visa” “paper curtain” after another. Finally, at that solemn and great moment, at 7:00 p.m. on November 16, two thousand people of different nationalities, races, social backgrounds, occupations, political and religious beliefs shouted out the same demand in different languages: Peace! They formed the first broad and powerful peace front in human history.
    Perhaps when you hear or say the phrase "the people of the world...", you only have a relatively abstract concept, but now, you personally see the entity that this concept represents. In the crowded aisles of the same venue, your shoulders are touching "the people of the world!" Perhaps you cannot immediately believe that people who are so different from you in appearance will think the same way and have the same desires as you. But now, you personally see that they are indeed as excited as you, standing on stools and tables, and passing and welcoming the two historic great documents—the Declaration to the People of the World and the Appeal to the United Nations Organization—with torrential applause and cheers, after repeated discussions and revisions. They crystallize the urgent demands and firm will of the people of the world (let us emphasize and pronounce each word carefully: the—whole—world—people); they condense the fresh blood of thousands upon thousands of young people and the tears of orphans and widows; they show that mankind has unlimited confidence in itself; they are powerful witnesses that good people have a common goal—peaceful creation, and in order to achieve this goal, they can use peaceful methods, through debate, concession, struggle, and compromise, to find a common path; at the same time, they also illustrate that the imperialists are the enemies of the people of the world—not only do they oppose this peace program, but they also plot to sabotage its creation and realization with extreme ferocity.
    The steel workers of Sheffield opposed making guns and cannons to slaughter peace-loving people for the British imperialists. They marched, they demonstrated, and did everything possible to promote the convening of the Second World Peace Congress in this center of the British Empire's arms industry. They moved their homes and vacated their houses to prepare to welcome the delegates to stay. But the reactionary leaders feared peace as much as they feared the day they would be hanged, and they brazenly and shamelessly sabotaged the holding of the congress. From the diplomatic tone of refusing entry to the thieving behavior of intercepting delegates' invitations, they did everything. But their sneaky conspiracies, before the power of millions of times more good people than them, ended in a miserable defeat. The true colors of the "Labour" government were more clearly exposed to more people. The great victory of the Second World Peace Congress made this small group of warmongers panic, at a loss and mute.
    In contrast to the British reactionaries, the people of Warsaw warmly extended their arms to welcome and embrace the peace warriors. Due to the obstruction and delay by the American and British war traffickers, the meeting address could not be decided early, forcing the Polish people to rush to complete the preparations for the congress in a very few days. This was a huge and arduous project, and its successful completion in itself demonstrated the strength of peace-loving people. This project, in addition to the preparations for passenger transport, reception, hotels, restaurants, and exhibitions, also required a venue that could accommodate three thousand people. Polish workers worked day and night to convert an unfinished printing factory, the "Polish Language Publishing House Building," into a large conference hall without pillars obstructing the view in just a few days. The glass ceiling was painted with peace doves and written with "peace" in various languages. The floor was covered with deep red carpets, and ten vertical rows of golden birch tables were arranged throughout the hall, equipped with tens of miles of telephone lines for eight languages: Polish, French, Russian, English, Spanish, German, Italian, and Chinese. The walls were decorated with colorful national flags of various countries, and the hall was illuminated by fluorescent and mercury lamps, making the hall even more bright and splendid. Dozens of blue peace flags fluttered on the roof of the building. Eleven (the number of member states of the Standing Committee) stone basins of "eternal flame" were built high on the plaza in front of the building, with bright flames leaping day and night. Outside the venue, groups of Warsaw people gathered in the plaza day and night to shout slogans and applaud the delegates entering and leaving the venue. On November 20, the day before the closing of the congress, three consecutive meetings were held in the morning, afternoon, and evening, extending until 6:00 a.m. the next morning. When the delegates came out, there were still many people waiting outside in the cold dawn. Delegates got on and off cars, went to bookstores, and went to theaters. Everywhere, groups of beautiful Polish boys and girls flocked to the delegates to ask for autographs and shake hands. All of this fully demonstrated how enthusiastically the Polish people, who had suffered the slaughter and enslavement of fascism, supported peace! Here is a side note: in desperation, reporters from reactionary British and American newspapers even fancifully fabricated that these elementary school students were beggars who came to the entrance of the congress venue to ask for bread. Even an idiot would not believe such ridiculous rumors!
    The workers of Warsaw supported the convening of the Great Congress with their labor, and all the people of Warsaw also welcomed the messengers of peace with their warm hearts. In addition to organized workers, women, staff, and students, the mass rallies and parades in the evening were attended by old men, old women, children... ordinary people also participated. They still carried their briefcases for daytime work, housewives still carried bags for knitting woolen threads, and young mothers still pushed baby carriages. They walked on the streets that had been stained with blood. They walked past those newly built workers' residences and the new building of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party that was under construction, as well as those collapsed churches and other buildings that were already planned but not yet rebuilt today. They walked past the ruins of broken walls and rubble that were specially illuminated by searchlights. It is extremely understandable that they shouted for peace so enthusiastically. There is no street without broken houses, no room without dead people, and not an inch of Warsaw soil that has not been soaked in the blood of Polish children! Before the war, Warsaw had a population of 1.3 million, but today it has only 700,000. Seventy-five percent of the houses and ninety percent of the public buildings were bombed, shelled, and set on fire by fascist planes, turning them into garbage dumps. The Jewish quarter, with a population of 300,000, was razed to the ground under Hitler's orders, and the prosperous commercial district became a desolate grave. Every family has lost at least one relative, and Warsaw women have lost 250,000 to 300,000 men. Today, it is very natural for them to shout against wars of aggression. Through their own efforts and with the help of the Soviet Union, they rebuilt the bridge connecting the two banks of the Vistula River, which is 474 meters long, in seventy-five days at a speed that broke the world record. In the suburbs, which were still barren land last May, their young students and workers studied and worked at the same time, and now they have become a new village with hundreds of buildings, a palace of culture, a theater, and a nursery that is about to be completed. Today, they shout to defend peace and oppose the slaughter and destruction of new Hitler bandits, and their voices are so firm and brave, which is completely expected.
    Before the opening of the congress, most of the delegates visited the entire city of Warsaw, saw many mounds of earth still covered with green grass, saw rows of broken walls with only window holes left, saw the ruins of the Jewish quarter, and saw the tall and bright buildings that had already been built. They saw Warsaw five years ago, and of course they also remembered the same disasters that their own countries had suffered from the same fascist bandits five years ago. They re-stroked the wounds that the wars of aggression of yesterday had inflicted on them, and they naturally easily remembered the fate of the Korean people today. Humanity, standing up from the sea of blood, is facing the crisis of being plunged into a deeper sea of blood. In the speeches of the one hundred and twenty delegates at the congress, you can often hear that whether they are from socialist countries, people's democratic countries, colonial countries, or capitalist countries, they always mention the former Warsaw, Kiev, Lites, and Caventley, as well as Paris and London, and also mention the current Pyongyang and Seoul in the same sad tone. Mrs. Gordon used her trembling and indignant voice to accuse the US imperialism's bombing in Korea: "On this ground shone by the sunlight, how much blood is flowing... We hear such atrocities, our tears cannot help but flow... MacArthur shamelessly promotes the atrocity of strafing women and children as a glorious communiqué!" Nanni also condemned the US imperialism's war policy as an attempt to "soak Korea with blood and turn her into a pile of rubble." Fadeyev pointed out with extreme contempt that those who ordered "turning Korea into a wasteland" cannot be regarded as human beings. He heavily told everyone that "the entire territory of Korea has been ravaged, and a large part of the population has been wiped out." The American black jurist, Harward, also warned: "Today it is Korea. Tomorrow it will be the turn of our African brothers." The sorrowful and moving accusation of Park Jung-ae, the chief representative of Korea wearing national costume, moved the entire audience even more. She confidently said that the Korean people would never be willing to be enslaved and that the liberation war would be victorious. When she said that this was due to "the help of the volunteer army of the great Chinese people, the best sons of their close neighbor," the venue was boiling with applause and cheers. Finally, everyone enthusiastically lifted Park Jung-ae up and repeatedly chanted the names of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Kim Il-sung. How sympathetic, supportive, praised, and loved were the transmitters of the peaceful will of the eighty-one countries that deeply hated the MacArthur's, the two great nations of China and Korea who bravely defended peace in the East!
    Before you flicker various colors and styles of clothing, different racial face shapes and skin colors. But the smiling faces radiate the same brilliance, showing great excitement and firm confidence. They know that they are backed by Stalin's Soviet Socialist Republic Union—this incomparably powerful fortress of peace that once crushed the barbaric attacks of German and Italian fascism! The victory of good mankind is certain.
    When the Chinese delegation bid farewell to Moscow, Soviet friends conveyed the news of the victory of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers carried in Pravda at the banquet. He said happily and solemnly: "You have given the US imperialists a solid lesson." He also said: "Today the eyes of the whole world are on the Chinese people." These words all show that peace-loving people know how to defend peace. The Korean people's movement for liberation and the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend their country are in line with justice and have won the support of peace defenders all over the world. Let us move forward bravely with the whole—world—people!

    华沙的胜利
    ——第二届世界和大记事之一
    本报随和大代表团记者  袁水拍
    在你跟前闪烁着各种颜色和不同式样的服装：青年团员的红领带和绿上衣，女教士的蝴蝶形的白色宽边帽，叙利亚回教徒的缠头巾，巴基斯坦妇女的披肩轻纱，波兰女农民的彩色百折围裙，天主教神父的肥大的黑色法袍，罗马正教主教的白色高冠和悬在胸前的宝石金十字。……浅灰色皮肤的拉丁美洲工人走来和你说话，螺旋形卷发和墨一般黑脸的南非洲青年走来和你握手。有你比较见得多的苏联、东欧、英、美、法、意国人，有你从来没有见过，甚至没有听说过的在非洲的象牙海岸人、黄金海岸人、塞内加尔人和毛里求斯岛人。不同种族的脸型和肤色：白、黄、褐、浅灰和深黑……在开幕前最后两天里面，波兰和捷克斯拉夫两国天空里连续不断地轰鸣着飞机，载来了一千多个出席二届和大的代表。他们之中，有的横越了半个地球，有的跋涉过万山千水，有的冲破了一道又一道封锁的边境和“签证”的“纸幕”。终于在那庄严伟大的时辰，十一月十六日下午七时，两千个不同国籍、种族、社会出身、职业、政治和宗教信仰的人用不同的语言喊出了同一个要求：和平！他们结成了人类历史上第一次出现的广泛而强大的和平阵线。
    也许当你听着或者说着“全世界人民……”这样一句话的时候，你只有一个比较抽象的概念，可是现在，你亲自看到了这概念所代表的实体。在同一会场的挤挤攘攘的纵横走道里，你的肩膀和“全世界人民”触碰着！也许你还不能马上相信，和你在外貌上这样悬殊的人会和你同样思索，同样愿望。可是现在，你亲自看到了，他们和你的确同样兴奋得站在凳上，桌上，和你同样用暴雨似的掌声和欢呼来通过，来迎接那几经讨论和一再修改的两个历史性的伟大文件——告全世界人民的宣言和致联合国组织呼吁书。它们结晶了全世界人民（让我们加重语气，一个字一个字地念：全—世—界—人民）的迫切要求和坚定意志；它们凝结着千千万万青年的鲜血和孤儿寡妇的眼泪；它们显示了人类对自己是具有无限信心的；它们是有力的见证，善良人类具有一个共同的目标——和平创造，为了达到这个目标，他们能够用和平的方法，经过辩论，让步，斗争，妥协，来找出一条共同的道路；同时，它们也说明了帝国主义者是全世界人民的仇敌——他们非但反对这和平纲领，而且他们穷凶极恶地阴谋破坏它的产生和实现。
    设菲尔德的钢铁工人反对替英帝国主义者制造屠杀和平人民的枪炮，他们游行，他们示威，尽一切努力来促成二届和大能在这英帝国的军火工业中心召开。他们把自己的家搬走，腾出屋子来准备欢迎代表们去住。反动头子们却害怕和平像害怕他们被绞死的一天来到一样，蛮横无耻地破坏大会的举行。从拒绝入境的外交官腔到截留代表请帖的小偷行为，什么都干。但是他们的鬼祟阴谋，在千百万倍于他们的善良人类的力量之前，归于惨败了。“工”党政府的原形更加清楚地暴露在更多的人面前。二届和大所获得的巨大胜利，使这渺小的一撮战争贩子张皇失措，暗哑无声。
    和英国反动派相反，华沙人民热烈地伸出臂膀来欢迎，来拥抱和平战士们。由于美英战贩的刁难拖延，开会地址不能早日决定，使波兰人民必须在极少几天内突击完成筹备大会的工作。这是一件巨大而繁重的工程，它的胜利完成，本身就表明了爱好和平人民的力量。这一工程，除客运，招待，旅馆，餐厅，展览会等筹备工作外，还需要一个能容三千人的会场。波兰工人日以继夜在短短几天里把一座尚未完工的印刷厂“波兰语出版社大厦”改建成为一座没有柱子阻碍视线的大会议厅。玻璃天花板上画满和平鸽子，写满各种文字的“和平”。地上是深红的毯子，全场排着十个纵列的金黄色的桦木桌，装置了长以几十英里计的波、法、俄、英、西、德、意、中八种译文的电话线。四壁是彩色缤纷的各国国旗，满场照耀着日光灯和水银灯，越发显得会场的光明灿烂。大厦屋顶上飘扬着数十面蓝色的和平大旗。大厦前广场上高筑起十一座（常设委员会委员国数）“永恒之火”的石盆，日夜腾跃着光明的火焰。在会场外，华沙人民一批又一批不分日夜聚集在广场上向进出会场的代表们高呼口号和鼓掌。十一月二十日，大会闭幕前一天，上下午和夜间连续举行三次会议，一直延长到明天早晨六点钟，当代表们出场时，在这样寒冷的黎明时分，场外依旧有许多人等待着。代表们上下汽车，上书店，上剧场，到处有美貌的波兰男女孩子一群一群拥向代表们要求签名，握手。这一切充分表示了身受法西斯屠杀奴役的波兰人民是多么热烈地拥护和平！这里附带提一笔，英美反动报纸的记者在无可奈何之中，竟异想天开把这些小学生捏造成到和大会场门口来要面包的乞儿。那怕白痴也不会相信这样可笑的造谣啊！
    华沙的工人用他们的劳动来拥护和大的召开，华沙所有的人民也同样以他们的热烈的心情来欢迎和平的信使们。晚上的群众大会和游行参加者，除了有组织的工人、妇女、职员、学生外，老头儿、老婆婆、儿童……普通的人民也都来参加。他们手里还挟着白天上班的公事皮包，主妇们还提着织绒线的口袋，年轻的母亲们还推着童车。他们走在曾经沾染血迹的街道上。他们走过那些刚才建筑好的工人住宅，和正在建筑中的波兰统一工人党中央的新厦，以及那些已经在计划中可是今天还没有重建起来的倾圮的教堂和其他建筑物。他们走过那些特意用探照灯照明了的断坦残瓦的废墟，他们这样地热烈高呼和平，是极可以理解的。没有一条街没有破房子，没有一间屋子没有死过人，没有一英寸华沙的土没有浸透过波兰儿女的血！战前的华沙有一百三十万人口，今天却只有七十万。百分之七十五的房屋、百分之九十的公共建筑，被法西斯飞机轰炸、炮击、纵火，而变成垃圾堆。三十万人的犹太区在希特勒的手令下夷为平地，繁华的商业区变成荒坟。每一家至少死过一个亲人，华沙的妇女失掉了二十五万到三十万的男子。今天他们高呼反对侵略战争，是非常自然的。经过他们自己的努力和苏联的帮助，他们以突破世界纪录的速度，在七十五天内重建联系维斯杜拉河两岸的长达四七四公尺的大桥。在去年五月还是一片荒地的郊外，他们的青年学生和工人一边学习、一边劳动，现在已经成为一个即将完成的有着几百幢楼房、文化宫、剧场、托儿所的新村。今天他们高呼保卫和平，反对新的希特勒匪徒的屠杀破坏，他们的声音这样的坚决，勇敢，是完全在意料之中的。
    在大会开幕前，多数代表去参观了华沙全市，看见了不少至今还是长着青草的土堆，看见了一垛垛仅留下窗洞的断墙，看见了犹太区的废墟，和已经建筑起来的高大明亮的大厦。他们看见了五年前的华沙，当然也记起了五年前自己国家所遭受的同样的法西斯匪徒的灾祸。他们重新抚摸着昨天侵略战争所给他们的创痛，他们自然很容易地想起了今天的朝鲜人民的命运。血海中站起来的人类正面临着投入更深的一个血海的危机。在大会一百二十个代表的发言中，你可以经常听到不管是社会主义国家的人，人民民主主义国家的人，还是殖民地的人，资本主义国家的人，他们总是用同样沉痛的语调提到从前的华沙、基辅、利台斯、卡文特莱，提到巴黎、伦敦，也说到现在的平壤、汉城。戈登夫人用她的颤抖的愤激的声音控诉美帝在朝鲜的轰炸：“在这太阳光所照的地面上，流着多多少少的鲜血……我们听到这样的暴行，我们的眼泪禁不住流下……麦克阿瑟把扫射妇女儿童的暴行，当作光荣的公报去作无耻的宣扬！”南尼也斥责美帝的战争政策是企图“把朝鲜浸透鲜血，把她变为一片瓦砾”。法捷耶夫以极端鄙视的心情指出那些命令“把朝鲜造成荒原”的几个人不能算作人类。他沉重地告诉大家“朝鲜整个国土都遭到了蹂躏，很大一部分人口已被扫除”。美国的黑人法学家哈华特也警告说：“今天是朝鲜。明天将轮到我们非洲的弟兄”。穿着民族服装的朝鲜首席代表朴正爱的悲痛动人的控诉更感动了全场，她充满信心地说出朝鲜人民决不甘受奴役和解放战争必胜的信念。当她说到这是由于“他们的紧邻的最优秀的儿子，伟大中国人民的志愿军的帮助”时，会场上沸腾着掌声和欢呼。最后大家狂热地把朴正爱举起来，周而复始地一致高呼斯大林、毛泽东、金日成的名字。深深地憎恶麦克阿瑟们的八十一国人民的和平意志的传递者是多么同情着，支持着，赞扬着，爱戴着在东方英勇地捍卫和平的中朝两大民族啊！
    在你眼前闪烁着各种颜色和不同式样的服装，不同种族的脸型和肤色。可是他们微笑的脸上放射着同样的光辉，显出莫大的兴奋和坚定的信心。他们知道，他们背靠着斯大林的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟——这曾经粉碎过德意法西斯蛮横进攻的无比强大的和平堡垒！善良人类的胜利是一定的。
    在中国代表团告别莫斯科时，苏联友人在宴会上传达真理报所载朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的胜利消息，他愉快而又严肃地说道：“你们已给美帝国主义者结结实实地上了一课。”又说：“今天全世界的眼睛朝向中国人民。”这些话都说明了爱好和平的人民是懂得怎样去保卫和平的。朝鲜人民的争取解放运动和中国人民的抗美援朝保家卫国运动是合乎正义的，是赢得了全世界和平保卫者的支持的。让我们和全——世——界——人民一起奋勇前进吧！
            十二月十九日中长路车中。
