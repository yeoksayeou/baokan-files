    The Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau has been processing dog registrations since the 11th of this month. Many dog owners have been going to the registration offices to complete registration procedures. As of the 25th, a total of more than 13,200 dogs have been registered in the city. To facilitate citizens in the southern part of the city, the bureau has temporarily added a registration office within the Eighth District Public Office, in addition to the original four registration offices in the eastern, western, southern, and northern parts of the city. The work at the various district registration offices is scheduled to end on January 10th of next year, after which only the No. 1 Paozi River Registration Office in the Eastern District will remain open to handle dog registration work on a regular basis.

    In addition, the dog catching team of the Outdoor Dog Handling Center of the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau began capturing unregistered stray dogs on the streets on the 23rd of this month. The team is divided into two groups, working in different districts in rotation. On the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, a total of more than 320 stray dogs were captured in the first, second, third, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts. Captured dogs are kept at the Paozi River Outdoor Dog Handling Center for three days, and if they are not claimed by their owners, they will be electrocuted.
