Recently, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army won a great victory on the Korean battlefield, inflicting a destructive blow on the enemy. The Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the main battlefield have advanced more than two hundred li, recovered Pyongyang, the temporary capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and liberated more than twenty important cities and vast rural areas. On the western front alone, in the week from November 25th to December 1st, 23,700 enemies were eliminated, including 10,500 American aggressor troops. One American company of 143 men surrendered to us, and we seized more than 500 cannons, more than 400 machine guns of various types, approximately 5,000 rifles and carbines, and approximately 2,000 vehicles. On the eastern front, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies routed two divisions of the American aggressor troops in the area west and south of Changjin Lake, and are now pursuing them towards the Hamhung coastal area. American news agencies admitted that these two divisions were half destroyed by us, and the U.S. Marine Corps First Division alone lost 7,000 men. The Korean People's Army units, deep behind enemy lines, cooperated with our army's counter-offensive on the front and launched active operations, liberating sixteen cities and vast rural areas. The American aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee bandit army have been routed and are in complete disarray, suffering heavy losses in personnel and equipment, their morale has plummeted, and they are panicking like homeless dogs, not knowing where to find a foothold. The New York Herald Tribune, a pro-war American reactionary newspaper, admitted: "This is the biggest defeat in the history of the American Army."

Prior to this, the American aggressors suffered a major defeat in northern Korea from October 25th to November 8th, with more than 13,000 American and Syngman Rhee bandits eliminated. However, the American aggressors did not learn from that defeat. They gathered all the forces that could be gathered on the Korean battlefield, totaling approximately 200,000 men including seven American divisions, one British and Australian brigade, one Turkish brigade, and six Syngman Rhee bandit divisions. On November 24th, they launched a so-called general offensive. The commander of the invading forces, MacArthur, called this offensive "the general offensive to end the Korean War." He attempted to occupy all of Korea's territory before Christmas (i.e., December 25th), in order to advance and attack the Chinese mainland. The invading enemy forces were divided into eastern and western routes. The enemy on the western route, numbering over 100,000, had scurried to the line of Nyongbyon, Sinheung-dong, Unsan, Taechon, and Chongju; the enemy on the eastern route, numbering 80-90,000, had scurried to the line of Chongjin, Hyesan, and Changjin Lake. The enemy also attempted to close the pincers from the east and west to annihilate the Korean People's Army and our People's Volunteer Army. On the day the general offensive began, MacArthur, on the one hand, ordered the U.S. Eighth Army to attack towards the Yalu River. At the same time, he took a plane to inspect the sky over the Yalu River, peeking into our northeastern border.

Our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army began their counterattack on November 25th. The Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the western front first inflicted a major blow on the U.S. Infantry Second Division and Twenty-fifth Division in the area northwest of Tokchon, around Sinheung-dong and Somin-dong. Later, in the area between Tokchon and Nyongbyon and Maengsan, they surrounded and annihilated most of the Syngman Rhee bandit army's Seventh and Eighth Divisions and part of the Sixth Division, thereby halting the enemy's offensive and turning to a counter-offensive. The enemy's entire line disintegrated, and they abandoned their armor and dragged their weapons, fleeing in a frenzy. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and surrounded parts of the U.S. Second Division's Ninth Regiment, Twenty-third Regiment, and Twenty-fifth Division's Twenty-fourth Regiment, and the Turkish Brigade in the area southwest of Kasan and Kunuri. After fierce fighting, the enemy was completely annihilated. At the same time, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the eastern front surrounded most of the U.S. Marine First Division and Infantry Seventh Division, which were advancing towards Changjin Lake, in the area west and south of Changjin Lake, inflicting heavy casualties on the American troops. The Syngman Rhee bandit army, which had rashly advanced to the line of Chongjin and Hyesan, saw the unfavorable situation, feared being annihilated, and hurriedly fled towards Hamhung and Wonsan. The Korean People's Army guerrillas, who had been operating behind enemy lines, were encouraged by the victory won by our People's Volunteer Army after joining the war last time. They have been more and more active day by day, and at this time they were like dragons and tigers, attacking and intercepting the fleeing enemy everywhere.

The victory of this great battle fundamentally changed the situation of the Korean War. The initiative of the war has been transferred to the hands of our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and the enemy's defeat and our victory are a foregone conclusion. The American aggressors are currently unable to recover on the Korean battlefield. If they do not surrender to us, they must quickly get out of Korea, otherwise they will be completely annihilated.

This victory in the Korean War was achieved with the participation of our People's Volunteer Army. This victory not only turned the tide of the Korean war, but also shattered America's entire plan of aggression and changed the direction of world affairs. The American imperialists have great ambitions. Following in the footsteps of the German and Japanese fascists, they dream of conquering the world. America's plan of aggression is: first occupy Korea and Taiwan, control Vietnam, and then encircle the Chinese mainland. At the same time, after completing its preparations, it will send troops to Western Europe, leading its little buddies like Britain, France, and West Germany, to ravage Europe. And its method of implementing this plan of aggression is "divide and conquer," which is what the American reactionary newspapers call "eating piece by piece." Korea and Taiwan are the first two pieces it started to eat. The Korean War is the first and largest-scale aggressive action that the imperialist camp headed by the United States has engaged in with all its strength after World War II. If we sit idly by and watch the United States devour Korea in peace, then this vicious demon will be rampant everywhere, extorting and extorting, and the people of the world will suffer endlessly. Now we have given it a heavy blow in Korea, hitting it so hard that it is running away with its tail between its legs. The first piece of meat it wanted to eat was not able to get into its mouth, and its momentum was shortened by half. And the people of Asia and the world are excited and encouraged by the victory of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and they are learning from the example of the Chinese and Korean people, rising up to resist American aggression, and world peace has been further guaranteed. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies this time is of great significance. Our People's Volunteer Army participated in the war on the Korean battlefield, helping neighbors, defending the motherland, and safeguarding world peace, which is a great honor for all the Chinese people.

This great victory proves two important truths: First, justice will surely triumph. The American aggression against Korea and Taiwan is for the purpose of enslaving the Korean and Chinese people, which is unjust; the Chinese and Korean people's resistance to American aggression is for the purpose of protecting national independence and people's freedom, therefore it is just. The American government and its lackeys, in order to cover up their crimes of aggression, raised the banner of the United Nations when they advanced into Korea, and sang aloud the tune of "maintaining peace and security," falsely accusing the Korean people as "aggressors." However, this cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the world. Because everyone can see very clearly that it is the United States that sent troops to Korea and Taiwan, not China and Korea that sent troops to American territory. The people of the whole world, including the vast number of people in the United States and its affiliated countries, sympathize with the Chinese and Korean people and oppose the American government's acts of aggression. America's aggression has met with the resolute resistance of the Korean people, and they have carried out frantic bombing and slaughter. Dozens of cities and thousands of villages have been burned down, and tens of thousands of Korean people have been slaughtered (12,000 people were slaughtered in Pyongyang alone during the American occupation), and countless Korean women have been raped. However, this bestial behavior of the American aggressors cannot subdue the Korean people, but has aroused the boundless anger of the Korean people, who are determined to fight the American bandits to the end. In this way, the American aggressors are plunged into the fire of the Korean people's resistance. As the saying goes: Those who are just are helped by many, those who are unjust are helped by few; those who are helped by many win, those who are helped by few lose. The United States has no justification, is opposed by the world, and its own vast number of soldiers do not know why they are fighting in Korea, and it is bound to fail. The Chinese people, in order to ensure their own safety and to uphold justice, stepped forward to help Korea, and as a result, they won the battle together with the Korean People's Army. Does this not prove that justice will surely triumph?

Second, the power of the world's people is greater than the power of the imperialist aggressors. The United States is a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. As long as the Chinese and Korean people and the world's people are united, they will definitely be able to defeat it. The reason why the United States lost this time is that it made two big mistakes. One is to overestimate itself and underestimate the people of China and Korea. It underestimated the will and determination of the Chinese and Korean people to resist aggression and cherish freedom, and always thought that as soon as it sent troops, Korea would obediently surrender, and China would dare to do something? However, not only are the Korean people strong and unyielding, but the Chinese people are all brave and enthusiastic to help their neighbors. This shattered its conspiracy to conquer Korea without fighting. It also underestimated the strength of the Chinese and Korean people. It was full of confidence that it could swallow a Korea with only 30 million people by using half of the U.S. Army, plus the shrimp soldiers and crab generals of the affiliated countries and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. Unexpectedly, as soon as the war started, the American aggressor troops suffered repeated defeats and retreated all the way to the Nakdong River; then they hurriedly dispatched reinforcements and landed in Incheon, temporarily gaining the upper hand, so they continued to attack to the edge of the Yalu River; but as soon as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army stepped onto the battlefield, it was immediately beaten to pieces. Second, it was too superstitious about weapons and suffered from the disease of the theory of weapons. The American imperialists believe that the United States can produce 90 million tons of steel a year, and there are plenty of planes, cannons, and tanks. China and Korea have very few of these things, so how can they beat it? However, what determines the outcome of a war is first of all people, the people who control the weapons, not the weapons alone. Weapons can only play a full role in the hands of people who have the will to fight and are good at using them. No matter how good the weapons are, it is useless if the people are incompetent. This time, some of the American young masters have been taught a lesson. A reporter from the American reactionary news agency Associated Press admitted: The U.S. military, which has an advantage in aircraft, tanks, and artillery, was decisively defeated by the infantry of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, who fought with rifles, machine guns, and mortars. A reporter from another American reactionary newspaper, the New York Times, said: "The American soldiers' faith in their weapons has been drastically reduced. The soldiers on the Korean front have realized that although they have the best weapons in terms of equipment, they cannot stop the enemy who is resolutely advancing." It can be seen from this that the American imperialism is a thorough and utter paper tiger. It bets its treasures on its immobile planes and cannons, and on the lack of determination and strength of others to fight. Therefore, it is accustomed to using pretentious and intimidating methods. Now the Chinese people and the Korean people are not intimidated by it, blocking the soldiers when they come, and using soil to dam the water when it comes. After fighting a battle with it, this paper tiger will show its true colors.

However, although the American aggressors have suffered defeat in Korea, they have not and will not give up. It released a smokescreen, saying that it is willing to stop the war. This cannot be believed. It is very obvious that this is to paralyze the people of China and Korea and preserve its aggressive forces in Korea. In reality, it is accelerating the implementation of the plan to expand the war.

What are the actual practices of the American aggressors and their partners? First, they continue to fight in Korea and refuse to withdraw their troops. Truman, Attlee, Marshall, and Acheson all said: The American and British invading forces were sent to Korea at the suggestion of the United Nations. "The United Nations has not changed the mission granted to them, and the troops of the United States and Britain will continue to fulfill their responsibilities." (See the Truman-Attlee Communiqué) Second, they continue to occupy Taiwan. The United States announced that the Seventh Fleet will never withdraw from Taiwan, and even if the Korean issue is negotiated, it cannot involve Taiwan. This means that the United States openly declares that it is an enemy of China and an aggressor of Chinese territory. Third, they continue to strengthen the military encirclement of our country. To this end, they are stepping up military assistance to their agents in Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, and other countries, turning these countries into military bases for aggression against China. Fourth, they are implementing an economic blockade against our country, prohibiting the import of many materials into our country, in an attempt to economically oppress our country. Fifth, in the United States and its affiliated countries, they are stepping up military mobilization, increasing military spending, expanding arms production, and expanding the size of the army. All of this proves that American imperialism does not want peace and does not want to end the war of aggression it launched.

Therefore, we Chinese people should continue to carry out the movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, and support our People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army who are fighting bravely. At the same time, we must strive to enhance national defense construction, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and continue to stabilize the financial economy, so that our country will become stronger. After the Chinese and Korean People's Armies fought these two great victories, the international situation is more favorable to our country. The people of all countries in the world have been further widely mobilized to resolutely oppose the aggression of the American and British blocs, while the internal of the imperialist camp is unprecedentedly chaotic. As long as we continue to work hard, strengthen national defense, and consolidate and expand the world peace and democracy camp, we will surely be able to smash any new acts of aggression by the enemy.

    庆祝中朝人民抗美战争的大胜利（供宣传员讲话用）
    最近我人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上打了一个大胜仗，给了敌人以歼灭性的打击。正面战场的中朝人民军队已前进了二百多里，光复了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的临时首都平壤，并解放了二十多个重要城市和广大乡村。只西线方面，在十一月二十五日至十二月一日的一周中，已经消灭了敌人二万三千七百人，其中有一万零五百人是美国侵略军，并且有美军一个连一百四十三人向我投降，缴获各种炮五百多门，各种机枪四百多挺、长短枪约五千支、汽车约两千辆。东线方面，中朝人民军队在长津湖以西和以南地区，击溃了美国侵略军的两个师，现在正向咸兴海岸地区追击中。美国通讯社承认：这两个师被我们消灭了一半，光美海军陆战队第一师就损失了七千人。深入敌后的朝鲜人民军部队，配合着我军在正面的反攻，也展开了积极的活动，解放了十六个城市和广大乡村。美国侵略军和李承晚匪军已溃不成军，兵员和装备损失惨重，士气一落千丈，惶惶如丧家之犬，不知到何处才能立定脚跟。一向好战的美国反动报纸纽约先驱论坛报自认：“这是美国陆军史上最大的失败。”
    在这以前，美国侵略者曾在十月二十五日至十一月八日，在朝鲜北部吃了一次大败仗，美李匪帮被消灭了一万三千多人。但是，美国侵略者没有接受那次失败的教训，它又集结了在朝鲜战场上可以集结的全部兵力，计：美军七个师、英澳军一个旅、土耳其军一个旅、李承晚匪军六个师，约共二十万人，于十一月二十四日，发动所谓总攻势。侵略军的统帅麦克阿瑟把这次攻势叫做“结束朝鲜战事的总攻势”，他企图在圣诞节（即十二月二十五日）以前占领朝鲜的全部领土，以便进而进攻中国大陆。进犯的敌军共分东西两路，西线的敌人十余万人，曾窜至宁远、新兴洞、云山、泰川、定州一线；东线的敌人共八、九万人，曾窜至清津、惠山、长津湖一线。敌人并企图将东西两钳合拢，把朝鲜人民军与我人民志愿军歼灭。在总攻开始那天，麦克阿瑟一方面下令美第八军向鸭绿江进攻，同时，自己坐了飞机到鸭绿江上空视察，偷窥我东北国境。
    我人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军于十一月二十五日起开始反击。西线中朝人民军队首先在德川西北的新兴洞、苏民洞一带给了美步兵第二师、第二十五师以重大打击。后来又在德川与宁远、孟山之间地区，分别包围并歼灭了李承晚匪军的第七、第八两师大部及第六师的一部，因而停止了敌人的进攻，并使自己转入反攻。敌全线瓦解，纷纷弃甲曳兵，狂奔逃命。我军乘胜追击，又在价川、军隅里西南地区，包围了美军第二师的第九团、第二十三团和第二十五师的第二十四团及土耳其旅各一部，经激烈战斗后，将敌全部歼灭。同时，东线的中朝人民军队将向长津湖进犯的美陆战第一师及步兵第七师大部，包围于长津湖以西和以南地区，打得美军死伤枕借。冒进至清津、惠山一线的李承晚匪军，见势不佳，害怕被歼，急忙向咸兴、元山方向逃窜。原来在敌人后方活动的朝鲜人民军游击队，受到上次我人民志愿军参战后所获胜利的鼓励，已经一天比一天活动，这时更如生龙活虎，到处袭击和截击溃逃的敌人。
    这一场大战的胜利，根本改变了朝鲜战争的形势，战争的主动权已转入我人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军手中，敌败我胜已成定局。美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上目前是无法翻身的了，它如果不向我们投降，就得赶快滚出朝鲜，否则就要全军覆没。
    朝鲜战争的这一胜利，是在我人民志愿军参战之下获得的。这一胜利，不但使朝鲜战局转败为胜，而且打破了美国的整个侵略计划，改变了世界局势的发展方向。美国帝国主义者野心很大，它跟着德、日法西斯的脚步，梦想征服全世界。美国的侵略计划是：首先占领朝鲜、台湾，控制越南，进而围攻中国大陆。同时，它在准备完毕以后，就以调兵西欧，率领英、法、西德那些小伙计们，蹂躏欧洲。而它实行这个侵略计划的方法是“各个击破”，也就是美国反动报纸所说的“一块块地吃”。朝鲜、台湾是它最先下手吃的两块。朝鲜战争，是以美国为首的帝国主义阵营，在第二次世界大战后，以全力经营的第一个规模最大的侵略行动。如果我们坐视美国把朝鲜安安稳稳地吃掉，那末，这个凶神恶煞就会凶焰万丈，到处横行霸道，敲诈勒索，全世界人民将要受害无穷。现在我们在朝鲜狠狠地给了它当胸一拳，打得它屁滚尿流，它想吃的第一块肉就没有能吃进嘴，气势就矮了半截。而全亚洲和全世界人民则因中朝人民军队的胜利而兴奋鼓舞，纷纷学习中朝人民的榜样，奋起反抗美国的侵略，世界和平就有了进一步的保障。所以，这次中朝人民军队的胜利意义是很大的。我国人民志愿军参加朝鲜战场的作战，救助邻人，捍卫祖国，屏障世界和平，对于全中国人民都是很大的光荣。
    这次大胜利，证明了两个重要的真理：第一、正义必然胜利。美国侵略朝鲜、台湾，是为了奴役朝鲜人民和中国人民，是非正义的；中朝人民反抗美国的侵略，是为了保护国家的独立和人民的自由，因此是正义的。美国政府和它的喽罗们，为了掩饰它们的侵略罪行，所以在进兵朝鲜的时候，打起了联合国的旗帜，并且口口声声地高唱着：“维持和平与安全”，反诬朝鲜人民为“侵略者”。但是，这并不能遮住世人的耳目。因为谁都看得很清楚，是美国派兵到朝鲜、台湾，而不是中国、朝鲜派兵到美国领土。全世界人民，包括美国及其附庸国的广大人民在内，都同情中朝人民，而反对美国政府的侵略行为。美国在政治上是孤立的。美国的侵略遭到了朝鲜人民的坚决反抗，便进行疯狂的轰炸和屠杀，几十个城市和成千个村庄被焚毁，成千成万的朝鲜人民被屠杀（光平壤城在美军占领时期就被屠杀了一万二千人），无数朝鲜妇女被奸污。但是，美国侵略者的这种野兽行为，不但不能压服朝鲜人民，而且激起了朝鲜人民的无比愤怒，抱定有敌无我的决心，誓与美寇斗争到底。这样，美国侵略者便陷入朝鲜人民反抗的火海之中。古语说得好：得道多助，失道寡助；多助胜，寡助败。美国师出无名，遭世人反对，他自己的广大士兵也不知道为什么要到朝鲜打仗，是肯定要失败的。中国人民为了保障自身的安全，也为了伸张正义，挺身而出，援助朝鲜，结果就和朝鲜人民军一起打了胜仗。这不正证明正义必然获胜吗？
    第二、世界人民的力量大过帝国主义侵略者的力量，美国是一只外强中干的纸老虎，只要中朝人民和世界人民团结得好，就一定能够打败它。美国这一次所以打败仗，是因为犯了两个大错误。一是过高估计自己，过低估计中朝两国人民。它小看了中朝人民反抗侵略、酷爱自由的意志和决心，总以为它一进兵，朝鲜就会服服贴贴投降，中国还敢有所作为？但是，不但朝鲜人民坚强不屈，中国人民更是个个义勇，热心救助邻人。这就破坏了它不战而征服朝鲜的阴谋。它也看轻了中朝两国人民的力量，满以为挟美国陆军之半，加上附庸国和李承晚匪帮的虾兵蟹将，要吞下一个只有三千万人口的朝鲜，岂非易如反掌。不料一开仗，美国侵略军就节节失利，一直败退到洛东江；于是赶紧调兵增援，并在仁川登陆，暂时占了优势，因此就一直攻到鸭绿江边；但是中国人民志愿军一踏上战场，它就又立刻被打得落花流水。二是太过迷信武器，害了唯武器论的毛病。美国帝国主义认为，美国一年可以生产钢铁九千万吨，有的是飞机大炮坦克车，中国和朝鲜这种家伙都很少，那里还能打得过它。可是，决定战争胜负的首先是人，是掌握武器的人，而不是单纯的武器。武器只有在具有战斗意志而又善于使用的人手里才能充分发挥作用。武器虽好，人不中用，也是枉然。这次可把美国有些少爷兵教训过来了。美国反动通讯社美联社的一个记者承认：在飞机、坦克、大炮方面占优势的美军，是被用步枪、机关枪、迫击炮作战的中朝人民军队的步兵决定性地打败了。另一美国反动报纸纽约时报的记者说：“美国大兵对他们武器的信仰剧烈地降低了。兵士们在朝鲜前线体会到，他们在装备方面虽有最优良的武器，却挡不住意志坚决地向前推进的敌人。”由此可见，美帝国主义是个彻头彻尾的纸老虎，它把宝押在自己不能动的飞机大炮上，押在别人缺乏斗争的决心和力量上，所以，惯于采取装腔作势，借故吓人的办法。现在中国人民和朝鲜人民不为它所吓倒，兵来将挡，水来土堰，跟它打一仗，这只纸老虎就显出原形来了。
    但是，美国侵略者虽然在朝鲜遭受了失败，它现在没有而且将来也不会死心的。它放出了一种烟幕，说是愿意停战。这话是相信不得的。很显然的，这是为了麻痹中朝两国人民，保存它在朝鲜的侵略势力。实际上，它正在加速实施扩大战争的计划。
    美国侵略者和它的伙计们的实际做法怎样呢？一是继续在朝鲜打下去，拒绝撤兵。杜鲁门、艾德礼、马歇尔、艾奇逊这些家伙们都说：美英侵略军是应联合国的建议派往朝鲜的。“联合国没有变更授予他们的使命，美英两国的军队仍将继续履行他们的责任。”（见杜艾公报）二是继续占领台湾，美国宣布第七舰队决不撤离台湾，就是谈判朝鲜问题，也不能涉及台湾。这就是说，美国公开表明它是中国的敌人和中国领土的侵略者。三是继续加强对我国的军事包围，为此，加紧对越南、菲律宾、泰国、缅甸等代理人的军事援助，把这些国家变为侵略中国的军事基地。四是实施对我国的经济封锁，禁止许多物资输入我国，企图从经济上压迫我国。五是在美国国内和它的附庸国中，加紧进行军事动员，增加军费预算，扩大军火生产，扩充军队编制。所有这些，都证明美帝是不要和平，不想结束它所发动的这场侵略战争的。
    因此，我们中国人民应该继续开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动，支援英勇奋战的我人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。同时，努力增强国防建设，巩固人民民主专政，继续稳定财政经济，使我们的国家更加强大起来。在中朝人民军队打了这两次大胜仗以后，国际形势更加有利于我国，世界各国人民都已进一步广泛地动员，坚决地反对美英集团的侵略，而帝国主义阵营内部却空前混乱。只要我们继续努力，加强国防，巩固和扩大世界和平民主阵营，就一定能够粉碎敌人任何新的侵略行动。（原载《时事手册》第五册）
