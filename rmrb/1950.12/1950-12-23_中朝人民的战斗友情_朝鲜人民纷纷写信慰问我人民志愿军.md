    The Militant Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean Peoples
    Korean People Write Letters to Comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Chinese People's Volunteers have received many letters of sympathy from people in various parts of northern Korea. The letters reveal the Korean people's unparalleled warm gratitude and love for the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    A Korean citizen named Kim Ki-yang wrote in his letter: "Dear comrades: I don't know what to write to express my gratitude. I can only tell you how I felt the first time I encountered you. One morning at three o'clock, I was passing over a mountain ridge when a convoy of cars came from the opposite direction. In order not to obstruct the advance of the cars, I stood in the bushes by the side of the road. Suddenly, I heard Chinese spoken from a car that stopped. In that instant, a lightning-like feeling shot into my brain – the Chinese people have come to help us! To tell my companions this surprising and joyful fact, I ran to the foot of the mountain in one breath, where dozens of companions had already gathered to welcome your team. A cadre in the team repeatedly said to us, 'You've worked hard,' comforting us. I stared in a daze at your magnificent team, my wife tugging at my sleeve beside me, saying, 'Shout 'Long live!'' Alas, truthfully, I didn't know why but I was already in tears, yet forgot to shout 'Long live.'" He concluded by writing: "Respected comrades, thanks to the great selfless help of the Chinese people, the determination of us Korean people to resist the aggression of American imperialism has become even stronger. We firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to us, the Chinese and Korean people!"

    中朝人民的战斗友情
    朝鲜人民纷纷写信慰问我人民志愿军
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：中国人民志愿军收到了很多朝鲜北部各地人民写来的慰问信。信中流露着朝鲜人民对我国人民志愿军的无比热烈的感激和爱戴。
    一位名叫金基阳的朝鲜老百姓的信中写道：“亲爱的同志们：我不知道应该写些什么来表示我的感激之情，我只能讲出我第一次碰到你们那一刹那的心情。有天早上三点钟，我正在过一座山岭，这时从对面开来了一队汽车。为了不妨碍汽车的前进，我站在路旁的草丛中。忽然一辆停下来的汽车里传出了中国话。这一瞬间，闪电般的感觉穿进我的头脑——中国人民来帮助我们来了！为了把这可惊可喜的事实告诉给我的同伴们，我一口气跑到山根底下，那里早已经有数十名同伴集合一起，在迎接着你们的队伍了。队伍里一位干部对我们连连道着辛苦，安慰着我们。我兴奋得发呆地望着你们雄壮的队伍，我的妻子在旁边拉着我的袖子说：‘喊万岁吧！’唉，真是的，不知道为什么我已经流了眼泪，却忘了喊‘万岁’。”他最后写道：“敬爱的同志们，由于有中国人民伟大无私的帮助，我们朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义侵略的斗争意志便更加坚强起来了。我们坚信，最后胜利一定属于我们中朝人民！”
