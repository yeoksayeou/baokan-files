Xinhua News Agency Report: Beijing students held a meeting on the evening of the 5th to commemorate the glorious fighting festivals of Chinese youth students, "December 9th" and "December 1st." Attending the meeting were Zhang Dazhong, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Gu Qizong, Chairman of the Beijing Student Federation, and over 1,400 student representatives and principals from major universities and middle schools throughout Beijing. After a commemorative ceremony, Comrade Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, gave a report. In his report, Jiang Nanxiang first clarified the importance of rapidly building national defense in China and the significance of young students and young workers participating in military cadre schools. He then emphasized that participation in military cadre schools is completely voluntary, and that Communist Party members, Youth League members, or general youth in schools and factories should decide their actions based on the principle of conscious voluntarism. Modern military technology must be mastered by conscious and advanced youth to maximize its effectiveness. Jiang Nanxiang then said that the enrollment should pay attention to the review work, not only paying attention to the political, cultural, and physical conditions of the youth, but also considering whether each person's specific situation is suitable for entering military schools. Today, of course, we must first meet the needs of national defense construction, but at the same time, we must also take care of the needs of general construction work. Finally, he pointed out: we must strengthen the youth's understanding of defending the motherland through this movement and prepare to respond to the call of the motherland at any time.
　　The meeting ended in a warm and excited atmosphere.
　　The Central Committee of the Youth League and the All-China Students' Federation, in order to commemorate the glorious anniversaries of the Chinese student movement, "December 9th" and "December 1st," held two symposiums on November 18th and 20th, respectively. At the "December 9th" Movement symposium, Lu Ping, Yang Shu, Yu Guangyuan, Zhang Shuyi, Liu Zhilan, and others who participated in the movement recounted the course of the movement, focusing on the deeds of young students participating in the southward propaganda group and anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines; and unanimously pointed out that the "December 9th" Movement showed that the Chinese youth movement must be combined with the people's revolutionary movement and with workers, peasants, and soldiers under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
　　At the "December 1st" symposium, Peng Hua, Wang Hanbin, Xiao Song, and others who participated in the movement reported on the course of the movement, emphasizing that the "December 1st" Movement promoted the Chinese students' tradition of opposing American imperialism and exposed the reactionary face of the American imperialist aid to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in carrying out the anti-people civil war; and explained that after the "December 1st" Movement, a large number of students participated in the people's guerrillas in various liberated areas, especially in the southwest.
　　Both symposiums unanimously believed that the fact that Chinese students combined with the people's armed forces during the "December 9th" and "December 1st" movements further encouraged today's young students to actively respond to the call of the motherland, accelerate national defense construction, and consolidate national defense strength.
　　The Central Committee of the Youth League, the All-China Students' Federation, and the Beijing Student Federation jointly held an exhibition to commemorate the "December 9th" and "December 1st" movements, which is scheduled to open at 2:00 pm today (9th) at the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace. It will last for a week and will be open from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm daily.

    纪念“一二九”“一二一”
    北京市学生举行大会   
    团中央和全国学联举办座谈会展览会
    【本报讯】新华社讯：北京市学生于五日晚举行纪念中国青年学生光荣的斗争节日“一二·九”“一二·一”大会，到会的有中国新民主主义青年团北京市委副书记张大中、北京市学生联合会主席古奇踪及北京全市各大、中学校的学生代表及各中学校长一千四百余人。大会于举行纪念仪式后，请中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会副书记蒋南翔同志作报告。蒋南翔在报告中首先阐明目前中国迅速建设国防的重要性，及青年学生青年工人参加军事干部学校的意义，继即强调指出，参加军事干部学校是完全志愿的，不论学校和工厂中的共产党员、青年团员或一般青年，均应根据自觉自愿的原则来决定自己的行动。现代化的军事技术，必须掌握在有觉悟的先进青年手中，才能发挥最大的效能。蒋南翔接着说，这次招生应当注意审查工作，不但应注意青年的政治、文化条件和身体条件，而且应考虑到各人的具体情况是否适合于进军事学校。今天当然首先要满足国防建设的需要，但同时还要照顾一般建设工作的需要。最后，他指出：要通过这次运动，加强青年对保卫祖国的认识，准备随时响应祖国的号召。
    大会在热烈兴奋的情绪下结束。
    【本报讯】青年团中央和全国学联为纪念中国学生运动的光辉纪念日“一二·九”、“一二·一  ”，曾在十一月十八、二十两日，分别举行了两次座谈会。在“一二·九”运动座谈会上，由参加过这一运动的陆平、杨述、于光远、张淑仪、刘志兰等叙述了运动经过，着重提到当时青年学生参加南下宣传团及敌后抗日游击战争的事迹；并一致指出：“一二·九”运动说明中国青年运动必须在中国共产党的领导下与人民革命运动结合，与工农兵结合。
    在“一二·一”座谈会上，由参加这一运动的彭华、王汉斌、萧松等报告运动经过，着重指出“一二·一”运动发扬了中国学生反对美帝国主义的斗争传统，揭露了美帝援助蒋介石匪帮进行反人民内战的面目；并说明“一二·一”运动以后，大批学生参加各解放区特别是西南的人民游击队。
    两次座谈会一致认为：“一二·九”和“一二·一”时，中国学生与人民武装相结合的事实，更鼓舞了今日的青年学生积极地响应祖国号召，加速国防建设，巩固国防力量。
    团中央、全国学联、北京市学联又联合举办纪念“一二·九”、“一二·一”运动的展览会，定在今（九）日下午二时起在北京劳动人民文化宫开幕，为期一周，每日上午九时至下午五时开放。
