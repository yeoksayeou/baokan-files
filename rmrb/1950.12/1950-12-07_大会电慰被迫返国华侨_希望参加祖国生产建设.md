Xinhua News Agency, December 6th. The Capital's Returned Overseas Chinese Conference Protesting British Imperialist Persecution of Malayan Overseas Chinese sent a telegram of condolence to our Malayan compatriots recently persecuted and forced to return home. The text of the telegram is as follows: Dear compatriots forced to return from Malaya:

Ignoring the repeated protests and warnings of the vast number of local people and overseas Chinese, the British colonial authorities in Malaya continue to carry out unprecedented political persecution against our overseas Chinese residing in Malaya. The villages where our overseas Chinese reside have been subjected to horrific burning and killing by the British authorities under the pretext of "guerrilla zones"; large numbers of overseas Chinese have been detained in death concentration camps, leaving you in a tragic situation of broken families and separation from loved ones in Malaya, and now they are illegally "repatriating" our overseas Chinese!

Compatriots! This fascist and bloody atrocity of the British imperialists in Malaya has aroused great anger and hatred among the local people and our people. Our overseas Chinese have been in Malaya for more than hundreds of years, and we have made great contributions to the production and construction of Malaya; we took the lead in launching the War of Resistance Against Japan, and it was the local people and our overseas Chinese who persisted in and achieved the victory of this war of resistance. The British imperialist colonial authorities have no reason to deprive our Malayan overseas Chinese of their legitimate right to reside and survive.

Compatriots! The crimes of the British imperialist Malayan authorities in adopting the brutal methods of the Japanese fascists to persecute and expel our Malayan overseas Chinese make it clearer to us that we must further strengthen the unity of our overseas Chinese, resolutely oppose all the evil deeds of the British imperialists in harming our overseas Chinese, and resolutely oppose the blatant large-scale arrest and expulsion of our overseas Chinese by the British authorities in Malaya, in order to fight for survival and defend our legitimate rights and interests locally.

Dear compatriots! You have returned to the embrace of the motherland from great suffering. We extend our sincere condolences to you and hope that, under the guidance of the local people's government, you will overcome difficulties, participate in production, help each other, establish yourselves and your families, and participate in all struggles for national construction and resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending the country. We will never allow the imperialists to trample on us and invade us again.

The future of the new China is infinitely bright, and our future is also infinitely bright. We wish you unity and progress.

                       Capital's Returned Overseas Chinese Conference Protesting British Imperialist Persecution of Malayan Overseas Chinese

    大会电慰被迫返国华侨
    希望参加祖国生产建设
    【新华社六日讯】首都归国华侨抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨大会电慰最近被迫害返国的我马来亚侨胞，电文如下：马来亚被迫害返国的亲爱的侨胞们：
    马来亚英殖民当局不顾当地广大人民和侨胞的一再抗议及警告，继续对我们居留在马来亚的侨胞肆行空前的政治迫害。我们侨胞所居住的乡村被英当局借口“游击区”进行恐怖的焚烧杀戮；大批侨胞被拘禁于死亡的集中营，使你们在马来亚陷于家破人亡妻离子散的悲惨境地，现在又非法地把我们侨胞“遣送”回来！
    侨胞们！马来亚英帝国主义者这种法西斯血腥暴行，已经引起了当地人民和我国人民极大的愤怒和仇恨。我们侨胞在马来亚已有几百余年的历史，我们华侨对马来亚的生产建设有过很大的贡献；首先发动了抗日战争，坚持和取得这个抗日战争的胜利的，也是当地人民和我们侨胞。英帝国主义殖民当局是没有任何理由来剥夺我们马来亚侨胞的合法居留权利与生存权利的。
    侨胞们！英帝国主义马来亚当局袭取日本法西斯的残暴手段来迫害和驱逐我们马来亚侨胞的罪行，使我们侨胞更加清楚地明白了：必须更加加紧我们海外侨胞的团结，坚决反对英帝国主义者残害我们侨胞的一切罪恶行为，坚决反对马来亚英当局这样明目张胆的大规模拘捕、驱逐我们侨胞的暴行，才能在当地争生存和保卫我们的正当权益。
    亲爱的侨胞们！你们从重重苦难中回到了祖国的怀抱，我们谨向你们致亲切的慰问，希望你们在当地人民政府的指导下克服困难，参加生产，互助互济，安家立业，参加祖国的生产建设和抗美援朝保家卫国的一切斗争。决不让帝国主义者再来蹂躏我们，侵略我们。
    新中国的前途是无限光明的，我们的前途也是无限光明的。祝你们团结进步。
                       首都归国华侨抗议英帝迫害马来亚华侨大会
                                                   十二月四日
