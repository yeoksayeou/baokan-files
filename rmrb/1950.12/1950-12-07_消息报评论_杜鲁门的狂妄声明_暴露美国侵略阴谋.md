    Truman's Arrogant Statement Exposes American Aggression Conspiracy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th] TASS, Moscow: The News Bulletin published an editorial on December 5th entitled "President Truman's Statement," stating: The setbacks suffered by the American aggressors in Korea have once again stirred up war hysteria among the American ruling clique. Truman's statement on November 30th completely exposed the aggressive conspiracies of the American ruling clique. He threatened to exploit the current situation in Korea to expand aggression and carry out other imperialist adventures. Truman's deliberate claim of being willing to negotiate peacefully is nothing but a deceptive trick. Since Truman has categorically rejected all the proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by the Korean Democratic Government and the Chinese People's Government, who can still believe his words?
    The editorial continued: Truman is roaring at the Chinese people, accusing them of "aggression." What else could this "accusation" be if not a mockery of common sense and truth? In Truman's view, it seems that even though the American imperialists have been acting mightily in Korea, China's neighbor, for months, constantly violating China's borders, China should not defend its borders; as for the United States, even though it is thousands of miles away from Korea, it should regard the territory of Korea as a particularly serious threat to its "security." And China, whose territorial integrity has been undermined by the American army, is an "aggressor" simply because Chinese patriots voluntarily help the Korean people and selflessly defend the sacred and inviolable borders of their motherland. But who can believe this, and who will believe this? The whole world knows the names of the real aggressors, and that is Truman, MacArthur, and their ilk.
    The editorial concluded: Truman obviously does not understand logic, let alone justice. But if he thinks that the vast people living on the earth have neither logic nor justice, then he is very wrong. Comments on Truman's statement prove that world opinion understands very clearly that the threat to peace now comes from American imperialism. This is why Truman felt it necessary to issue his war-mongering statement, and this is why the American ruling clique is now having their usual fit of war hysteria.

### 消息报评论  杜鲁门的狂妄声明  暴露美国侵略阴谋

    杜鲁门的狂妄声明暴露美国侵略阴谋
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报十二月五日以《杜鲁门总统的声明》为题发表社论称：美国侵略者在朝鲜遭受挫败，又在美国统治集团中引起了一阵战争歇斯底里。杜鲁门十一月三十日发表的声明，完全暴露了美国统治集团的侵略阴谋。他威胁着要利用目前朝鲜的局势来扩大侵略，和进行帝国主义的其他冒险。杜鲁门故意说愿意循和平途径进行谈判，只不过是一种骗术而已。既然杜鲁门断然拒绝了朝鲜民主政府和中国人民政府所提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的一切建议，那末还有谁会相信他的话呢？
    社论继称：杜鲁门向中国人民大声咆哮，控告他们进行“侵略”。这种“控告”如果不是对常识和真理的嘲弄，还会是什么呢？在杜鲁门看起来，好像虽然美帝国主义者在中国邻邦朝鲜作威作福达几个月之久，经常侵犯中国的边界，中国也是不应当保卫它的边疆的；至于美国，好像它虽然距朝鲜有几千英里远，它也该把朝鲜领土看作是对它的“安全”有特别严重的威胁似的。而领土完整已被美国军队破坏了的中国则是“侵略者”，原因只是中国的爱国志士出于自愿地帮助朝鲜人民，忘我地保卫他们祖国的神圣不可侵犯的边界。可是，能够使谁相信这种事，而谁又会相信这种事呢？全世界都知道真正侵略者的名字，那就是杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟之流。
    社论最后指出：杜鲁门显然是不懂得逻辑的，更谈不上懂得正义。但是如果他以为居住在地球上的广大人民也没有逻辑没有正义的话，那他就大错特错了。对杜鲁门声明的评论，证明全世界舆论懂得很清楚，现在对和平的威胁来自美帝国主义。这就是杜鲁门认为有必要发表他那贩卖战争的声明的原因，这就是美国统治集团现在正在发作他们所经常发作的战争歇斯底里的原因。
