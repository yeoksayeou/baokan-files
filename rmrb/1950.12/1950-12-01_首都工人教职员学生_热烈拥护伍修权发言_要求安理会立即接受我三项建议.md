Workers, Teachers, and Students in the Capital
Enthusiastically Support Wu Xiuquan's Speech
Demanding the Security Council Immediately Accept Our Three Proposals

[Report from Our Newspaper] Workers, teachers, and students in the capital enthusiastically support the speech of our representative Wu Xiuquan at the United Nations Security Council, in which he accused the United States of armed aggression against our territory of Taiwan. They unanimously believe that this speech represents the firm will of the 475 million people of the entire country. They demand that the Security Council immediately implement the three proposals put forward by our Central People's Government. They expressed excitement at the fact that the Chinese people, for the first time at an international conference, thoroughly exposed and denounced the imperialist crimes of aggression, and are determined to do everything in their power to support this just struggle against American aggression.

Employees of the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region had been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to read our delegation's accusation against the American imperialists since Representative Wu Xiuquan arrived in New York. After reading the newspaper, Zhou Jianjun of the proofreading section read the entire speech in one breath and said, "Comrade Wu Xiuquan is truly our good representative. His words are just like the words I wanted to say. After reading it, I felt like I had vented my anger and given the American imperialists a good beating." Zhou Huaxiang, head of the binding section, said, "Representative Wu Xiuquan's speech exposed the true colors of the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries in front of the people of the world. This speech shows that the Chinese people who have stood up cannot be bullied!" All the employees of the factory also vowed to use practical actions to improve production as a backing for our delegation.

Renmin University of China, Northern Jiaotong University, and Beijing Railway College launched heated discussions. Li Fenglian, a labor hero studying at Renmin University, said, "Representative Wu Xiuquan's accusations and proposals are precisely the opinions of the entire Chinese people and the people of the world. The Security Council should listen to the people." Wang Zhiwei, a student in the Department of Diplomacy who had led the militia in landmine warfare, said, "If the Security Council does not take effective measures to make the American robbers get out of Taiwan and Korea, we will use armed force and volunteer troops to eliminate them!" During the discussion at Jiaotong University Beijing Railway College, it was also emphasized that in the past, the American imperialists had used their voting machine to try every means to prevent the representatives who truly represent the Chinese people from attending the United Nations. Today, we are able to openly accuse the American imperialists of their crimes of aggression to the people of the world at the United Nations Security Council. This is another great victory for us in our struggle against imperialism. We clearly know that this great victory was won by the Chinese people through persistent struggle; this great victory is inseparable from the strong support of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving new democratic countries.

Renmin University of China and Jiaotong University Beijing Railway College also sent telegrams to Representative Wu Xiuquan, warmly supporting his speech and believing that his just struggle will surely be victorious. They also believe that the United Nations Security Council should immediately accept the three proposals put forward in the speech. If the Security Council continues to be manipulated by the American imperialists and does not take effective measures to sanction the American aggressors, we should immediately strengthen our practical actions to cut off the bloody claws of the American imperialists. Renmin University also expressed extreme indignation and serious protest against the collusion between Bebler, the representative of Yugoslavia and chairman of the Security Council, and the American representative Austin, allowing Austin to speak first, and the United Nations continuing to allow the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group to attend.

After reading the newspaper, students from various agencies, factories, and schools in the Fourth District, as well as Yenching University, the attached middle school of the Normal University, Yuying, Baiman, the Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School, and Xinsheng Middle School, applauded enthusiastically, and some shouted slogans such as "Support Representative Wu Xiuquan's accusations!" "Support the Chinese delegation's proposals to the Security Council!" "Severely punish the American aggressors!" Their emotions were extremely enthusiastic.

    首都工人教职员学生
    热烈拥护伍修权发言
    要求安理会立即接受我三项建议
    【本报讯】首都工人、教职员、学生热烈拥护我国代表伍修权在联合国安全理事会上控诉美国武装侵略我国领土台湾的发言。一致认为：这一发言代表了全国四万七千五百万人民的坚决意志。要求安理会将我中央人民政府提出的三项建议立即付诸实施。对中国人民第一次在国际会议席上将帝国主义侵略罪行痛快淋漓地予以揭露和痛斥，表示兴奋。并决心尽所有力量，支持这一反对美国侵略的正义斗争。
    华北军区政治部印刷厂职工从伍修权代表到达纽约后，即时刻盼望着能读到我代表团对美帝的控诉。校对股周建均看到报纸，一口气把这个发言读完后说：“伍修权同志真是我们的好代表。他的话就像我要说的话一样。读完后，心中就像出了一口怨气，痛揍了美帝一顿似的。”装订股股长周化祥说：“伍修权代表这一讲，可使美帝和国民党反动派在全世界人民面前现了原形。这个讲演表明了站立起来的中国人民是不可欺侮的！”全厂职工并誓愿用搞好生产的实际行动作我代表团的后盾。
    中国人民大学、北方交通大学北京铁道学院展开了热烈讨论。在人民大学学习的劳动英雄李凤莲说：“伍修权代表的控诉和建议，正是全中国人民和全世界人民的意见。安理会应该听人民的话办事。”曾领导民兵打过地雷战的外交系学员王志伟说：“安理会如果不采取有效措施叫美国强盗滚出台湾、朝鲜，我们就用武装力量和志愿部队消灭它们！”交大京院讨论中，并着重指出：以前美帝曾利用其表决机器，千方百计地阻挠真正代表中国人民的代表出席联合国。今天我们能够在联合国安理会上公开地向全世界人民控诉美帝的侵略罪行，这是我们与帝国主义进行斗争的又一次伟大的胜利。我们清楚地知道这个伟大的胜利，是我国人民坚持斗争争取来的；这个伟大的胜利，是和苏联及其他爱好和平的新民主主义国家的大力支持分不开的。
    中国人民大学和交大京院并致电伍修权代表，热烈拥护并支持他的发言，相信他的正义斗争必然胜利。并认为联合国安全理事会应立即接纳发言中提出的三项建议，如安理会继续受美帝操纵而不采取有效手段以制裁美国侵略者，我们应即加强实际行动来斩断美帝血爪。人民大学并对安理会主席南斯拉夫代表贝勃勒与美国代表相勾结，让美国代表奥斯汀首先发言，联合国仍然允许国民党反动残余集团的所谓“代表”继续出席，表示万分愤慨与严重抗议。
    四区各机关、工厂、学校和燕京大学、师大女附中、育英、贝满、市立女二中、新生中学等校学生见报后，有的热烈鼓掌，有的高呼“拥护伍修权代表的控诉！”“拥护中国代表对安理会的建议！”“严厉制裁美国侵略者！”等口号，情绪异常热烈。
