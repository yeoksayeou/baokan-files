    【Benbao Shenyang Telephone】Northeast Daily News: In December, another large group of young workers and students from various parts of Northeast China have left their factories and schools to take up new jobs and learning positions, including about one thousand several hundred to study at various military cadre schools run by the Central Military Commission. Before their departure, factories and schools held grand and enthusiastic farewell meetings.
    Young workers and students in Northeast China have a deep affection for the motherland. Whether it is modern military technical schools, or health and communications schools that need students, they all rush to respond to the call of the motherland and enthusiastically sign up. In mid-December, more than 3,000 young students in Shenyang alone signed up to take the military school entrance exams. There are no city-wide statistics for young workers in Shenyang who signed up to take the military school entrance exams, but according to statistics from only nine factories such as the Chemical Plant, more than 350 young workers have signed up.
    Many parents of young workers and students have expressed their active support and encouragement for their children's patriotic actions. Lu Chengchun's father from Jiamusi Middle School said at the farewell meeting: "My son stepped forward when the motherland needed him. This is the glory of the school and also the glory of us as parents. I hope that the students who participate in military cadre school studies will all return with glorious medals in the future!"

    东北青年工人学生又有千人投考
    【本报沈阳电话】东北日报消息：东北各地青年工人、学生，在十二月份，又有大批人走出工厂、学校投入新的工作和学习岗位上去，其中到中央军委所办各种军事干校学习的，约有一千数百人。他们临行时，各厂、各校都召开了隆重热烈的欢送大会。
    东北的青年工人、学生，对祖国有着深厚的感情。无论现代化的军事技术学校，或卫生、通讯学校需要学员时，他们都争先恐后地响应祖国的召唤，踊跃报名。十二月中旬，仅沈阳市报名投考军校的青年学生即达三千余人。沈阳市报名投考军校的青年工人，全市尚无统计，仅按化工厂等九个厂子的统计，就有三百五十多个青年工人报名。
    许多青年工人、学生的家长，表示积极支持与鼓励子弟的爱国行动。佳木斯市中学卢成春的父亲在欢送会上说：“我儿子当祖国需要时挺身而出，这是学校的光荣，也是我们做家长的光荣。我希望参加军事干部学校学习的同学，将来都挂着光荣的勋章回来！”
