    The main contents of the second issue include Stalin's "Answers to Comrades," published in Pravda on July 11, July 22, and August 2; To help readers understand Stalin's brilliant literature on linguistics, this issue published M. Kamari's "Stalin on Marxism in Linguistics". There are also several special articles, two articles on logic and dialectics, and more than ten other articles.

    《哲学问题》（俄文）第二期到京
    苏联科学院哲学研究院出版的《哲学问题》（俄文）一九五○年第二期最近运抵北京国际书店。
    这是个大型专门性杂志，每季出刊一次，主要为以科学的态度，阐明辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义中的问题；研究哲学史，自然哲学，逻辑学，美学及其他有关系的诸知识范畴，其任务为坚持马列主义立场，为维护哲学中的党性和战斗的唯物主义向反动的资产阶级哲学和所谓客观主义作积极而不可调和的斗争。
    第二期主要内容，有斯大林于七月十一日，二十二日及八月二日在真理报上发表过的“给同志们的回答”；为帮助读者了解斯大林这一关于语言学方面的灿烂文献，本期发表了Ｍ·卡马里的一篇“斯大林论语言学中的马克思主义”。另有专论几篇及有关逻辑学与辩证法的文章两篇及其他文章十余篇。
    本期运来不多，读者可到国际书店购买，为避免供应不足情形，最好向该店订阅。
