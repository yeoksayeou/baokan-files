    Neglect of Granary Work in Various Counties Under the Jian'ge Special District of Northern Sichuan Leads to Undue Losses of Public Grain Entering Storage

    To the Editor:
    In the Jian'ge Special District of Northern Sichuan this year, the grain requisition work began half a month to a month earlier than last year to coincide with the work of eliminating bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, and returning deposits. Last year, it was from mid-September to early October; this year, it started in early September. As of now, except for Qingchuan, Pingwu, Beichuan, and Wangcang counties, which still have some tasks to complete, the other six counties—Langzhong, Cangxi, Jiange, Zhaohua, Jiangyou, and Guangyuan—have basically completed their tasks, with Langzhong and Cangxi exceeding their quotas. This is a good phenomenon in grain requisition work.
    From the beginning of the requisition this year, almost all working comrades who could be transferred from the Commissioner's Office and below were sent to the countryside to participate in the grain requisition work. The shortcomings in this year's grain requisition work are the lack of adequate preparation of storage tools in advance, insufficient storage capacity, and insufficient careful inspection of grain quality. In addition, due to continuous rainy weather since autumn, grain generally experienced heating, sprouting, and insect infestation after entering storage.
    An examination of the causes of this phenomenon reveals that the main reason is that the grain requisition and storage work were not well coordinated, and the leading organs of the counties neglected the importance of storage work. For example, the grain administration leadership organization at the county level, according to the establishment, is supposed to be responsible by a dedicated person, but in many counties of the Jian'ge Special District, it is concurrently handled by the Finance Section of the county government, so grain administration has become an incidental task. Although some counties have dedicated branch warehouse directors, they are often constrained by the Finance Section due to a lack of understanding of their responsibilities, and they cannot proactively advance the work, resulting in a disconnect between the upper and lower levels in the entire grain administration. In addition, the working comrades at various requisitioning warehouse stations lack a sense of responsibility for their own work, resulting in serious losses of public grain entering storage this year.
    After discovering these situations, the Special Commissioner's Office sent working comrades to conduct a general inspection in various counties. According to preliminary feedback, in the Guojia Ferry warehouse in Zhaohua alone, more than 400,000 jin of newly harvested yellow rice was heating up, and thousands of jin of yellow rice was sprouting. The Wulian warehouse in Jiange knew that we were going to inspect the warehouse and buried more than 3,000 jin of moldy and sprouted yellow rice under a large quantity of good grain in an attempt to conceal their mistakes; only after local people reported it, were they ordered to turn it over. Zheng Yuanyu, the director of the Kaifeng warehouse in Jiange, showed no concern for the more than 6,000 jin of grain that had molded and become infested with insects from the previous handover. In Guangyuan County, more than 400,000 jin of corn, because it was harvested unevenly in terms of dryness and wetness, began to generate high heat less than half a month after entering storage; fortunately, it was discovered early, and immediate turning and sun-drying were carried out, minimizing the losses.
    According to the inspection results, another reason for the grain heating up was the lack of ventilation bamboo cages. When we suggested to the granary workers that they should correct this, they also admitted that it needed to be corrected.
    The Special Commissioner's Office's handling of these issues: on the one hand, urged the grain depots in various counties to carry out turning, ventilation, and sun-drying; on the other hand, conducted education for the grain depot workers and strengthened on-site inspections. In addition, we are studying the causes of these problems in order to improve our work in the future.
                                                                                                                                                                                      Song Ying

### 川北剑阁专署各县忽视粮库工作  大批入仓公粮遭受不应有的损失

    川北剑阁专署各县忽视粮库工作
    大批入仓公粮遭受不应有的损失编者同志：
    川北剑阁专区今年征粮工作，因为要配合清匪、反霸、减租、退押的工作，时间比去年提早了半个月至一个月。去年是九月半至十月初，今年是九月初就开始了。到目前为止，除青川、平武、北川、旺苍等县尚有部分任务待完成外，其他阆中、苍溪、剑阁、昭化、江油、广元等六县，基本上业已完成任务，其中阆中、苍溪两县，还有超额。这是征粮工作中的好现象。
    本年自开征时起，专员以下能够抽调的工作同志，差不多都派下乡去参加了征粮工作。今年征粮工作中的缺点是仓储工具事前没有适当准备，仓容不敷，粮食品质检查不够认真等，再加入秋以来阴雨连绵，以致粮食入仓后普遍发生发热、生芽、生虫等现象。
    检查造成这一现象的原因，主要是征粮与入仓工作没有配合好，各县领导机关忽视了保管工作的重要性。譬如，县一级的粮政领导机构，照编制是专人负责，但是剑阁专区好些县都是由县府财政科兼办，因而粮政成了附带任务。有些县虽有专设分库主任，可是又往往受到财政科因不明职责而引起的牵制，不能主动推进工作，结果在整个粮政方面，造成上下脱节现象。加上各征收仓站工作同志对本身业务缺乏责任心，致使今年入仓公粮遭受严重损失。
    专署发现这些情况后，就派出工作同志到各县普遍检查。据初步反映材料，仅昭化的郭家渡仓库，便有四十余万斤新收的黄谷发热，数千斤黄谷生芽。剑阁武连仓库知道我们要去查仓，把三千多斤霉变生芽的黄谷，埋在大批好谷子下面，企图掩蔽错误；经当地群众反映，才督饬倒翻开来。剑阁开封仓库主任郑远瑜，对前任移交的六千多斤粮食霉变生虫，毫不关心。广元县仓库的四十多万斤包谷，因为收得干湿不匀，入仓后不到半月便发高热；尚幸发觉得早，马上进行倒仓翻晒，损失甚微。
    根据检查结果，粮食发热的另一原因是没有装置通气竹笼。当时向粮库工作同志提出意见，他们也承认需要纠正。
    专署对这些问题的处理：一面督促各县粮库进行倒仓、风凉、翻晒，一面对粮库工作同志展开教育，并加强巡回检查。此外，并研究产生这些问题的原因，以求今后业务的改进。  宋英
