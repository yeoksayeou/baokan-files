Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: He Xiangning, Chairperson of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, recently sent a telegram to express condolences to the persecuted overseas Chinese compatriots who were illegally expelled from Malaya by the British colonial government and returned to Shantou. The telegram first sternly condemned the fascist atrocities of the British imperialist colonial authorities in Malaya for persecuting overseas Chinese, stating: The Malayan Peninsula, originally sparsely populated, has been built into what it is today by relying on our hardworking and resilient overseas Chinese compatriots who have developed it with their blood and sweat for centuries. However, the reactionary British colonial government has long persecuted overseas Chinese in Malaya. On June 18, 1948, it announced the implementation of the so-called "Emergency Ordinance," intensifying its actions and carrying out large-scale arrests, imprisonments, killings, and expulsions of our overseas Chinese compatriots. Recently, the British colonialists have even more barbarically detained our overseas Chinese compatriots in concentration camps on a large scale, and expelled them back to their homeland in batches, depriving them of their right to make a living, and plunging them into a desperate situation of bankruptcy, family separation, and starvation. The telegram pointed out: "Such a large-scale, bloodless, and vicious policy further exposes the hideous faces of the British imperialists in Malaya."

In her condolence telegram, Chairperson He expressed her deep concern for the persecuted overseas Chinese who have returned to the country, and hoped that they would overcome difficulties and engage in production and study under the guidance of the local People's Government, the Relief Committee for Distressed Overseas Chinese, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau.

    马来亚被迫害返国的华侨抵汕
    侨委会主委何香凝致电慰问
    并严斥英帝迫害华侨的法西斯暴行
    【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝，顷致电慰问被马来亚英国殖民政府非法驱逐出境返抵汕头的被难侨胞。电文首先严斥马来亚英帝国主义殖民当局迫害华侨的法西斯暴行称：原属地旷人稀的马来亚半岛，百年来依靠我们刻苦耐劳的侨胞，用血和汗加以开发，才建设成今天的马来亚。但反动的英国殖民政府却长期地迫害马来亚华侨。一九四八年六月十八日又宣布实施所谓“紧急法令”，变本加厉，对我国侨胞大规模地进行逮捕、囚禁、杀戮与驱逐。英国殖民者最近更横蛮无理地大规模地将我国侨胞拘禁于集中营，并将他们分批驱逐回国，剥夺了侨胞谋生的权利，陷侨胞于破家荡产、妻离子散、饥寒交迫的绝境。电文指出：“这样大规模的杀人不见血的毒辣政策，更加暴露了英帝国主义者在马来亚的狰狞面目。”
    何主任委员在慰问电中对于被迫害返国的侨胞，表示深切的关怀，盼望他们在当地人民政府、救济难侨委员会和侨务局的指导下，克服困难，从事生产和学习。
