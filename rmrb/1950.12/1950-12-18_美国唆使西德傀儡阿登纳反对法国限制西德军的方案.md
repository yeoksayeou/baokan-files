Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 14th: The ink is barely dry on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's decision to establish a German mercenary army under certain restrictions, and the United States has already launched a movement through Bonn to remove all obstacles hindering West Germany's complete remilitarization.

As is well known, the representatives of the North Atlantic Group countries have adopted the "compromise plan" proposed by the Assistant Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This plan adopted a French request that the newly established German forces be divided into "small units" to participate in the so-called European Army.

Why does the French government still need this shy reservation about so-called "small units"? The problem is that the French government is afraid that openly announcing the reconstruction of the aggressive German army will cause anger in France. However, according to the West German news agency, Deutsche Presse-Agentur, Bonn Chancellor Adenauer told reporters from the International News Service that the Bonn "government" would reject the new French plan because it stipulates that only brigade-sized German troops can be utilized in the Atlantic army. Adenauer said that if France and other Western countries agree to the principle of complete equality between the German armed forces and other countries (which currently mainly refers to the equipment and command of the army), then Adenauer is willing to let the US supreme commander handle the procedural issues of incorporating the German army into the North Atlantic army. Adenauer particularly insisted that the aggressive mercenary army currently being established must be equipped with heavy weapons.

Schumacher, the leader of the right-wing Social Democratic Party of Germany, recently openly admitted that the German mercenary army currently being established is an aggressive army. When Schumacher met with reporters from the International News Service, he spoke in accordance with Adenauer's policy, explaining that the West German army does not need to fight on its own territory, but rather in the East. Undoubtedly, such blatant and unscrupulous demands, if not directly ordered by Washington, are at least known to Washington in advance before being raised by this American puppet. Therefore, Adenauer's statement is considered by democratic people to be a spearhead of the American policy against the reservations made by France, and another action to clear the way for West Germany's undisguised and unrestrained remilitarization.

    美国唆使西德傀儡阿登纳反对法国限制西德军的方案
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社柏林十四日讯：北大西洋公约国家关于在某种限制下成立德国雇庸军的决定墨沈未干，美国就又通过波恩发动了一项运动，要求取消一切妨碍西德彻底重新军事化的障碍。
    如所周知，北大西洋集团国家的代表已通过了北大西洋公约国家外长助理会议所提出的“折衷方案”，该方案采纳了法国的一项要求，即：新建立的德国部队分成“小支部队”参加到所谓欧洲军中去。
    为什么法国政府还需要关于所谓“小支部队”这种羞羞答答的保留呢？问题是法国政府害怕公开宣布重建侵略的德国军队会在法国引起愤怒。但是，根据西德的德国新闻社消息：波恩总理阿登纳曾告诉国际新闻社记者说：波恩“政府”将拒绝新的法国计划，因为它规定仅能在大西洋军队中利用德国的以旅为单位的部队。阿登纳说：如果法国和其他西方国家赞成德国武装部队与其他国家完全平等的原则的话（这在目前主要是指在军队的装备与指挥方面），那么，阿登纳就愿意把德国军队加入北大西洋军队的程序问题听由美国最高统帅处理。阿登纳特别坚持现在在建立中的侵略性雇佣军，必须获得重武器的装备。
    德国右翼社会民主党领袖舒马赫最近曾公开地承认目前正在建立中的德国雇佣军是侵略军。舒马赫在接见国际新闻社记者时却按照阿登纳的方针讲话，他解释说：西德军队无须在它的自己领土上作战，而是要在东方作战。无疑地，这样公然无忌的要求，如果不是受到华盛顿的直接命令的话，至少也是事先为华盛顿所知道，才能由这个美国傀儡提出来的。因此，阿登纳的声明在民主的人们中被认为是美国方针对法国所作的保留的矛头，并且是为毫无掩饰毫无拘束的西德重新军事化扫清道路的又一个行动。
