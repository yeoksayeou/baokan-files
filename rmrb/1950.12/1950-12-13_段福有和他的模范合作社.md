Duan Fuyou and His Model Cooperative
·Lifu·

The lives of the farmers in Hequ Village, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, have improved after land reform. However, they still face difficulties on the road to prosperity. For example, some households still lack grain during the lean season; some often lack good cotton seeds at sowing time; and some, when the slack season for sideline production arrives in winter, find that the sales and raw materials for sideline production become problems.

Hequ Village originally had a cooperative, but people didn't know how to use it. Everyone thought that investing shares was good for dividends; but later, due to price fluctuations, even the capital couldn't be preserved. The superior cooperative had sent directors several times, but because no one really thought about how the cooperative should be run according to the needs and requirements of the members, it was still called the "Botched Cooperative" by everyone.

In the second year after the land reform in the village—last spring—the old cooperative collapsed, and everyone clamored to establish a new one. Farmers invested part of the extra property they had received in the land reform as shares, and elected Duan Fuyou, a former hired laborer who had never even owned a furrow of land, as the director. Old Duan, who was not yet forty years old, had sold his children and his wife had left due to hunger; he had tasted all the hardships in the world. After turning over in the land reform, he wholeheartedly wanted to do something good for everyone. But because he didn't understand how a cooperative should be run at the beginning, he turned the cooperative into a "small store" and made no progress. Last August, the county convened a cooperative meeting, which proposed to "reform the old cooperatives, abolish dividends, handle supply and marketing, serve the production of members, and meet the requirements of members." Old Duan felt that this was the road he had been searching for but hadn't found in the past.

When Duan Fuyou returned to the village, he found six directors and twenty-one member representatives to hold a meeting to discuss how the new supply and marketing cooperative should operate? What should be done for the members first? At that time, it was before the autumn harvest, and there was little early-maturing grain, so there was a gap between the old and new crops. Of the 60 hectares of land in the village, 14 hectares were planted with cotton, and every household lacked grain. In the past, private merchants took advantage of this opportunity to pre-purchase cotton from farmers at prices 30% to 40% lower than the market price; people had to endure the pain and sign contracts with private merchants to sell their cotton because they were "pinned down." Now, at this meeting, after everyone reflected on the current urgent needs of the farmers in the village, they asked: "Can the cooperative solve this matter?"

Based on the members' requirements, Duan Fuyou went to the county cooperative to sign a contract for exchanging grain for cotton, first distributing 3,000 catties of grain to the members to help them through the famine, and settling the price of cotton separately in the fall. In this way, not only was it guaranteed that each catty of ginned cotton could be sold for eight to ten catties of rice, but the members also received a 2% discount on grain below the market price. Everyone welcomed this method extremely. After the cotton came down, people handed over all the cotton to the cooperative, accounting for 95% of the total sales in the village. This was done again this autumn. And supplied the members with 46,000 catties of grain at preferential prices. At this time, everyone no longer called the cooperative the "Botched Cooperative," but said with satisfaction: "It's not just Fuyou, we are 'blessed'."

The people of Hequ Village who had just been allocated land were still weak. After last autumn, people looked forward to the long days of winter when they should engage in production to find income. Fuyou then found everyone again to hold a meeting to discuss. After the directors' investigation, it was found that more than 80 members of the entire cooperative knew how to weave wickerware, but because the raw materials could not be supplied, and it was only sold nearby, private merchants suppressed the price, and they couldn't sell it, so people were discouraged. If this craft could be done well, the income for a winter would be very good. When Fuyou found out, he asked the cooperative to first purchase and store the goods for sale to distant places, and at the same time buy back willow branches to supply the members. In this way, the effort for everyone was saved, the work was doubled, and the profit was also greatly increased. In the past, the average person earned two catties of rice per day, but now they can earn eighteen catties. From last October to the present, the cooperative has supplied a total of 30,000 catties of willow branches to the members, and sold 8,921 pieces of wickerwork, earning 102,000 catties of rice. For those who could not weave wicker, the cooperative organized 32 large carts to transport grain to Changzhi, Shanxi, three times, earning 8,000 catties of grain, which was a considerable income.

This spring, the cooperative again investigated the needs of the members, and then carried out business around spring plowing and sowing. Originally, about a dozen households planted "S" cotton last year, which produced more than local cotton, and each catty also sold for half a catty more rice. This year, members all requested "S" cotton seeds. The cooperative bought more than 10,000 catties of good cotton seeds, guaranteeing that everyone would sow 27 hectares of "S" cotton on time. In addition, the cooperative also supplied 500 various farm tools and 10,700 catties of oil cake. The goods came cheap, and the selling price was also cheaper than the market price. A hoe sold for 16,000 yuan on the market, but the cooperative sold it for 3,000 yuan cheaper. A plowshare sold for 7,800 yuan on the market, but the cooperative sold it for 6,500 yuan. In order to solve the difficulty of grain shortage in the spring, Fuyou also requested the county cooperative to lend the members 21,000 catties of grain, enabling all members of the village to smoothly invest in spring plowing and sowing. In the fall, people also found that this variety of cotton produced 20 catties more than the local cotton. As a result of the promotion of improved varieties, the village produced 52,000 catties more seed cotton this year.

The facts encouraged the members to care about their cooperative and aroused the desire of the masses outside the cooperative to join. The cooperative's membership increased from 276 to 1,003, accounting for 85% of the village's population, and the share capital also tripled. After the land reform, people's desire for prosperity, with the help of the cooperative, has become even clearer. Production has exceeded pre-war levels, and everyone has enough to eat and wear. Whenever they talk about the cooperative, people always talk about one small thing: after the cooperative revised its new charter, it initiated collective grazing of livestock, hiring only two elderly people, which replaced more than 40 children in the village who used to go to the mountains to graze cattle. Each livestock paid four ounces of rice per day, which solved the problem of more than 40 children going to school. Is this a small thing? People said: "This is not a small thing!"

At last winter's county-wide labor model conference, the Hequ Cooperative was selected as a model cooperative, and Duan Fuyou was elected as a cooperative hero. Fuyou said that his experience has only three points: "Do it according to what the Communist Party says; do it according to the requirements of the members; and must rely closely on the superior cooperative." His opinion is: the Communist Party instructs to serve the people, the members require to serve production, and the superior cooperative can give us great help. Duan Fuyou said to others: his cooperative has only taken the first step, so it was elected as a model. If all villages are run like this, his model cooperative must be run even better. Now he is discussing with the member representatives, this winter, on the one hand, developing the wickerwork industry, but also to solve the problem of livestock feed supply (because more cotton is planted and less grain). At the same time, according to everyone's requirements, he will develop the credit business and prepare to do a good job in next year's production.

    段福有和他的模范合作社
    ·力夫·
    经过土地改革的河北省武安县河渠村农民的生活已经改善了。但是，他们在走向富裕的道路上，还有困难。比如，有的户口在青黄不接时还缺粮食；有的在播种时常常没有好棉籽，收下棉花后，还不能保证卖个好价钱；有的到了冬天农闲副业生产的季节，副业生产的销路和原料却又成了问题。
    河渠村原来也有个合作社，但是人们不会使唤它。大家想的是入了股好分红；可是后来却因为物价波动，连本也保不住了。上级合作社曾派过几次主任，因为没有人真正想到合作社应该按社员的要求和需要去兴办，所以办来办去，大伙还是叫它“胡作社”。
    在该村土地改革后第二年——去年春天，旧社赔垮了，大家又哄着成立了一个新社，农民把在土地改革中所分到的一部分浮财入了股，选出一位过去连一垅地都没有的雇工段福有当主任。年纪不到四十岁的老段，孩子卖了，老婆饿走，世界上的艰难困苦都尝过了；在土地改革中翻身以后，一心想给大伙办点好事。但是因为他开头也不懂合作社应该怎样办法，所以也还是把合作社办成了个“小商店”，并无起色。去年八月，县里召集了一次合作社会议，会上提出要“改造旧社，取消分红，办理供销，为社员生产服务，满足社员要求”。老段觉着这才是过去找来找去没找到的一条路。
    段福有回到村里便找了六个理事和二十一个社员代表开会商量新的供销社究竟怎样干法？先给社员办些什么？当时正在秋收以前，早熟庄稼很少，青黄不接。全村六十顷地里就有十四顷种的是棉花，家家缺粮。过去私商都趁这时机拿比市价低百分之三、四十的价钱，预购农民的棉花；人们因为“磨扇压着手”，只好熬着疼和私商订下出卖棉花的合同。现在，在这会上大家反映了本村农民当前迫切的要求后问：“这件事合作社能解决吗？”
    段福有根据社员的要求，跑到县社订立了互换粮棉的合同，先发给社员三千斤粮食度荒，秋后收花时各作各价。这样，不仅保证了每斤皮棉可卖八斤到十斤米，对社员还有粮食低于市价百分之二的优待。大家对于这个办法欢迎极了。棉花下来以后，人们把棉花都交到合作社去了，占到全村售量的百分之九十五。今年秋天也是这样办的。又以优待价格供给了社员四万六千斤粮食。此时大家再不叫合作社是“胡作社”了，而是满意地说：“不是福有，是我们‘有福’。”
    河渠村刚分了地的人们，气力还是单薄的。去年秋后，人们盼着冬天好长的日子应当闹生产找进项。福有就又找大家开会商量。经过理事们调查的结果，全体社员中有八十多人会编柳器，但是因为原料供不上，又光在眼前销，私商压价，销不出去，所以人们闹着没劲了。要是把这手活闹好了，一冬天的收入就很不错。福有知道了，就叫合作社先收购存货往远地销，同时买回柳条供给社员。这样，省了大家的工夫，多出一倍活，利也大了，过去平均每人每天赚二斤米，现在能赚十八斤。从去年十月到如今，合作社总计供给社员柳条三万斤，推销柳货八千九百二十一件，赚米十万二千斤。对于不会编柳的人们，合作社组织了三十二辆大车到山西长治运粮三次，挣了八千斤粮食，收入真不小。
    今年春天合作社又调查了一下社员的需要，然后围绕春耕播种开展业务。原来去年有十来户种了斯字棉，比本地花产量大，每斤还多卖半斤米。今年社员都要求斯字棉种。社里就买来一万多斤好棉籽，保证大家按时播种了二十七顷斯字棉。另外，合作社还供给了各种农具五百件，油饼一万零七百斤。货来便宜，卖价也就比市上贱。锄板市上卖一万六千元，合作社贱三千元。犁铧市上卖七千八百元，合作社卖六千五百元。为解决春天缺粮的困难，福有又要求县社贷给了社员两万一千斤粮食。使全村社员顺利投入春耕播种。秋后人们又发现这号棉种比本棉多产二十斤。推广良种的结果，今年全村多产籽棉五万二千斤。
    事实鼓舞着社员关心自己的合作社，并激起了社外群众入社的要求。合作社的社员由二百七十六人发展到一千零三人，占到全村人口的百分之八十五，股金也增长了三倍。土地改革后，人们要求富裕的希望，在合作社的帮助下已经看得更加清楚了。生产超过战前，大家足吃足穿。每逢谈起合作社，人们总是念念不忘地只谈一件小事：合作社改立新章程后，发起伙放牲口，只雇了两个老年人，就代替了全村四十多个孩子到山上放牛。每天每个牲口出四两米，就解决了四十多个孩子上学的问题。这是小事吗？人们说：“这可不是小事呵！”
    去冬全县劳模大会上，把河渠合作社选成模范合作社，段福有当选了合作社英雄。福有说，他的经验只有三条：“照共产党说的办法去办；按着社员的要求去办；还必须紧紧依靠上级合作社”。他的意见是：共产党指示为人民服务，社员要求的是为生产服务，上级合作社能给我们很大的帮助。段福有向别人说：他的合作社不过是先走了一步，所以当选了模范。若是各村都这样办起来，他的模范合作社就必须办的更好才行。现在他正和社员代表们商量，今冬一面发展编柳条业，还要把牲口草的供给问题解决了（因种的棉多，谷少）。同时根据大家的要求把信用业务搞起来准备搞好明年的生产。
