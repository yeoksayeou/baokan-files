Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 14th: Hundreds of thousands of civilian workers from Shandong and Northern Jiangsu participating in winter water conservancy projects have universally launched a patriotic labor emulation campaign, greatly improving the work efficiency of the workers.

The fourth phase of the Shu River regulation project in Shandong Province fully commenced on October 30th. A total of 200,000 civilian workers are participating in the regulation work along the 70-kilometer-long project area of the Shu River. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the regulation work, the Daoshu Zhengyi Working Committee first convened an enlarged meeting of the secretaries of the Chinese Communist Party at all levels, secretaries of the Youth League Working Committee, and responsible cadres in technical and administrative aspects. It was decided to strengthen the education on the current situation of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country among the civilian workers and launch a labor emulation drive. After the meeting, all Communist Party members of the No. 4 Brigade of the Tancheng Command Post took the lead in responding, determined to win the model red flag. The No. 2 Brigade of the Pi County Command Post also refused to fall behind, and all the civilian workers immediately put forward the slogan "Earn a red flag and return to Pi County with glory." The "Airplane Team" of the Lanling Command Post, which won the title of model team in the third phase of the Daoshu project, greatly improved the morale of the civilian workers in this emulation campaign because Communist Party members such as Hu Yifu took the lead in jumping into the water to dig the dragon ditch. Up to now, half of the fourth phase of the Daoshu project has been completed, with an estimated 5 million cubic meters of earthwork and 400,000 cubic meters of stonework. The work efficiency of the civilian workers has generally improved compared with the past, and some have even improved by one to two times.

In addition to the winter repair project of the Grand Canal, the water conservancy project in Northern Jiangsu this winter mainly includes the dredging project of the Yi River and the main drainage rivers in the Huaiyin and Yancheng Special Districts. After studying the current situation, the 370,000 civilian workers mobilized to participate in the work immediately launched a heated patriotic labor emulation drive. From the start of work in mid-November to the end of November, all the civilian workers have completed one-half of the entire winter project, about 8 million cubic meters of earth. The Su Shangfu squad in Lianshui County and the Xu Bahu and other civilian worker teams completed 60 cubic meters of earth in 20 days. Wang Daqiu, a model worker and special-class meritorious person in guiding the Yi River, who attended the National Model Worker Representative Conference, first challenged them. The Ni Huailin civilian worker team in Yancheng, with 42 people, dug 700 cubic meters of earth in three and a half days. It is estimated that the 30-day project of the team can be completed in 16 days.

    展开爱国主义竞赛  
    四期导沭工程已完成一半
    【新华社上海十四日电】山东、苏北参加冬季治水的数十万民工，普遍掀起了爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，民工工作效率大大提高。
    山东省第四期导治沭河工程在十月三十日全面动工，沿沭河七十公里长的工程地带，共有二十万民工参加导治工作。导沭整沂工作委员会为了使导治工作顺利进行，首先召开了中国共产党各级党委书记、青年团工委书记及技术、行政方面负责干部的扩大会议，决定在民工中加强抗美援朝保家卫国的时事教育，展开劳动竞赛。会后，郯城指挥所四大队全体共产党员首先响应，决心夺取模范大红旗。邳县指挥所二大队也不甘落后，全体民工立即提出“挣个大红旗，光荣回邳县”的口号。曾在第三期导沭工程中荣获模范队称号的兰陵指挥所“飞机队”，在这次竞赛运动中，由于共产党员胡义孚等带头跳水挖龙沟，大大提高了民工的情绪。到现在为止，四期导沭工程已经完成一半，约计五百万土方及四十万石方。民工们的工作效率普遍较前提高，有的甚至提高了一至二倍。
    苏北区今冬治水工程除运河冬修工程外，主要是沂河及淮阴、盐城专区各主要排水河道的疏浚工程。动员参加工作的三十七万民工在学习了目前时事以后，立即热烈地展开了爱国主义的劳动竞赛。自十一月中旬开工到十一月底止，全部民工已完成了今冬全部工程的二分之一，约八百万公方土。涟水县苏尚富小队，徐八斛等民工班，二十天即完成六十公方土，出席全国劳模代表会议的导沂特等功臣王大锹民工班首先向他们挑战。盐城倪怀林民工班四十二人，三天半挖土七百公方，该班三十天的工程估计十六天即可完成。
