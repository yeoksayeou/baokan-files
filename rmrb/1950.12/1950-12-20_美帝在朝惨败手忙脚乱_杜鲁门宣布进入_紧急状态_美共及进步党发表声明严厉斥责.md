Xinhua News Agency, December 18th:  Struggling in a panic due to its miserable defeat in Korea, U.S. President Truman issued an order on December 16th, declaring a "national emergency" in the United States. Truman ordered the entire country to be placed completely under wartime control, in order to carry out unrestricted suppression and exploitation of the domestic population, and to continue to drive the United States toward a fate of even greater failure. In the order, Truman openly coerced the American people to sell their lives for the aggressive interests of the monopolistic capitalists' so-called "nation," demanding that every American make "any necessary sacrifices" for the "nation."

The day before declaring the so-called state of emergency, Truman delivered a lengthy speech announcing that the purpose of taking this step was to realize four plans that he believed the United States must make, namely continuing the aggressive policy of so-called "maintaining the principles of the United Nations," stepping up military expansion, speeding up munitions production, and strengthening dictatorship. Truman demanded "reduction of civilian production in many industries," "reducing non-military expenditures in the budget to the minimum necessary to provide effective support for the defense effort," requiring "further taxation," and "demanding that all concerned not set wages beyond the limits allowed by the standard."

Truman's declaration that the United States had entered a state of emergency demonstrated the extreme fragility of U.S. imperialism. It showed the growing internal crisis of U.S. imperialism; the United States, merely carrying out limited military operations in the Far East and suffering preliminary blows from the Chinese people, had already found it necessary to declare a "state of emergency."

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: Truman's declaration of a "national emergency" has been sharply criticized by domestic progressive forces representing the people. The Communist Party of the United States issued a statement on the 17th, denouncing Truman's action as "a vicious deception," and calling on workers to act in unity to oppose profit-seeking warmongers and safeguard the interests of workers. The statement also called on the American people to strive for peace, friendship with the Soviet Union, and the participation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

On the same day, Paul Robeson, secretary of the Progressive Party of the United States, also issued a statement, denouncing Truman's move as deepening America's real emergency. He advocated friendship with China, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, the cessation of interference in Taiwan, and the entry of representatives of the 475 million Chinese people into the United Nations.

    美帝在朝惨败手忙脚乱
    杜鲁门宣布进入“紧急状态”
    美共及进步党发表声明严厉斥责
    【新华社十八日讯】因为在朝鲜的惨败而手忙脚乱的美国总统杜鲁门，于十二月十六日发布命令，宣布美国处于“全国紧急状态”。杜鲁门命令将整个国家完全置于战时管制之下，以便对国内人民进行无限制的镇压与榨取，而继续驱使美国向着更大的失败的命运前进。杜鲁门在命令中，公开胁迫美国人民必须为独占资本家的所谓“国家”的侵略利益而卖命，要每一个美国人为“国家”而“作任何必要的牺牲”。
    在宣布所谓紧急状态的前一日，杜鲁门曾发表长篇演说，宣布他所以采取这一步骤的目的，在于实现他所认为美国必须做的四点计划，即继续所谓“维护联合国的原则”的侵略政策，加紧扩张军备，加紧军火生产，和加强独裁。杜鲁门要求“削减许多行业的民用生产”，“把预算中的非军事费用减少到给予国防努力以有效支持所必需的最低限度”，必需“更进一步的征税”，“要求所有有关的人都不要把工资定得超过了标准所容许的限度”。
    杜鲁门之宣布美国进入紧急状态，表明了美帝国主义的极端脆弱。它显示了美帝国主义内部危机之日益增长，美国仅仅在远东进行有限的军事行动和遭受中国人民的初步打击，就已发觉非宣布“紧急状态”不可了。
    【新华社十九日讯】杜鲁门的宣布“全国紧急状态”一事，受到了国内代表人民进步力量的尖锐抨击。美国共产党于十七日发表声明，斥责杜鲁门这一行动为“凶恶的欺骗”，并号召工人一致行动，反对追逐利润的战争贩子，保障工人的利益。声明同时号召美国人民一致争取和平，与苏联友好以及使中华人民共和国参加联合国。
    同日，美国进步党书记鲍尔温也发表声明，斥责杜鲁门此举将加深美国真正的紧急状态。他主张与中国友好，所有外国军队撤出朝鲜、停止干涉台湾以及使四亿七千五百万中国人民的代表进入联合国。
