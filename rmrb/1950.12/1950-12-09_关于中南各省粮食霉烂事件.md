    To the Editor:
    After reading the news on the third page of the Yangtze Daily on November 29th, "140 million jin of public grain have rotted and become infested with insects in Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Guangxi provinces; leadership at all levels is rapidly inspecting and sunning it," I felt extremely pained and astonished. "The incomplete statistics from four provinces" show that 140 million jin of grain have rotted and been eaten by insects (if all four provinces were included, the number would be even higher!). Regarding such a serious event, I have yet to see the parties involved make a profound self-criticism.
    If the 140 million jin of public grain were rice paddy, it could be processed into approximately 130 million jin of rice. Assuming an adult eats 28 liang (1.75 lbs) per day, it could feed over 74 million people for one day, or feed 5 million People's Liberation Army soldiers for half a month; it is equivalent to a quarter of the Huai River harnessing budget. Based on the rural situation in eastern Jiangxi (each middle peasant household can be allocated two mu of paddy fields, yielding 1,200 jin of dried rice), 140 million jin of public grain is the annual income of 116,666 middle peasant households. At a time when the people of the whole country are saving every thread and needle for the sake of resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and when our People's Volunteer Army is fighting in the freezing cold to defend the security of the motherland, the people of the whole country cannot tolerate such incidents. As a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, I request the People's Supervisory Organs to investigate the responsible leadership institutions and punish those who have neglected their duties.

### 关于中南各省粮食霉烂事件

    关于中南各省粮食霉烂事件编辑同志：
    读了长江日报十一月二十九日第三版“湘赣鄂桂等省入库公粮霉烂、生虫一亿四千万斤，各级领导机关正迅速检查翻晒”的消息，使我非常痛心和惊奇。“四省不完全的统计”，就霉烂、虫蚀粮食一亿四千万斤（要是四省全部统计，当不止此数），这是多么巨大的数字！对这样严重的事件，我至今尚未看到有关方面作深刻的自我批评。
    一亿四千万斤公粮，如果是稻谷，可制九二米一亿三千万斤左右。成人每日以吃二十八两计算，可供七千四百余万人吃一天，可供五百万人民解放军吃半月；等于治淮经费的四分之一。依照赣东的农村情况计算（每个中农可分水田二亩，收晒干的稻谷一千二百斤），一亿四千万斤公粮是十一万六千六百六十六个中农的一年的收入。当我们全国人民为抗美援朝保家卫国而一针一线都要节省的今天，当我们人民志愿军为了保卫祖国安全而在冰天雪地作战的今天，全国人民对这样的事件是不能容忍的。我以人民解放军战士的资格，请求人民监察机关检查有责任的领导机构，并惩办失职人员。
