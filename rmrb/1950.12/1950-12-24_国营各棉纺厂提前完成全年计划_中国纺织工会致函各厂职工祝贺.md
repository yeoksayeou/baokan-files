    [Reported by this newspaper] The state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, and the Northeast and Northwest regions have all completed their annual yarn and cloth production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas. The Second Plenary Session of the National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union sent a letter of congratulation to the workers of all factories on the 19th of this month. The original letter is as follows:
    To the Textile Workers' Union Committees of Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Dalian, and the Textile Workers' Union Committees of the Northeast and Northwest Regions, to all workers of state-owned cotton textile factories:
    According to your reports, Shanghai completed 116.14 percent of its annual yarn plan and 107.62 percent of its annual cloth plan by the end of November. Tianjin completed 105.6 percent of its annual yarn plan and 102.2 percent of its annual cloth plan by December 14th. Qingdao completed 102.01 percent of its annual cloth plan by the end of November. Dalian completed 108.44 percent of its annual yarn plan by the end of November. The Northeast completed 102.38 percent of its annual cloth plan by the end of November. The Northwest completed 104.53 percent of its annual yarn plan by the end of November. This is a glorious victory for you on the production front. The National Committee extends its warm congratulations to you.
    Over the past year, you have waged arduous struggles against the various difficulties left to us by the enemy, overcome many difficulties in production, and gradually increased production. In particular, the workers of Shanghai have carried out a heroic anti-bombing struggle, shortening the downtime caused by enemy bombing and ensuring the normal development of production. It is hoped that you will use the spirit of patriotic competition to consolidate your achievements, study hard, improve your technical skills, and strive to overfulfill the 1951 production plan. Win even greater victories on the production front, strengthen the country's economic power, support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people who are resisting U.S. aggression and defending their homes and countries, and smash U.S. imperialist aggression!
