Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 4th: According to the Progressive Daily, the Tianjin business community was greatly encouraged after receiving Chairman Mao's reply telegram of the 2nd of this month. They stated that they would follow Chairman Mao's instructions, unite with the masses, and strive for the victory of the just cause of resisting America and aiding Korea.

    Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, who is attending the enlarged meeting of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction in Beijing, told the Progressive Daily reporter in an extremely excited voice: "This shows Chairman Mao's attention to our patriotic demonstration parade in Tianjin, which is a great encouragement to the Tianjin business community and also a great encouragement to industrialists and businessmen throughout China. Tianjin industrialists and businessmen are determined to take practical actions to further promote the movement to resist America and aid Korea. The people of the whole country have the same enthusiasm and determination to resist America and aid Korea, and I believe that major industrial and commercial cities across the country will make the same expressions and actions, without a doubt. Workers, peasants, intellectuals and industrialists and businessmen across the country, all patriots, are united to fight for the final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression."
    Bi Mingqi, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "Chairman Mao hopes that our industrialists and businessmen will join the people and form a united front against imperialist aggression that is more solid than ever before. We guarantee to fulfill this instruction. Before liberation, our industrialists and businessmen tasted the oppression of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, which left our national industrialists and businessmen with no way out. Today, our people's strength has driven away all imperialists, especially the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries, rescuing us from the dark hell and leading us to the bright and happy road. How fortunate we are to have encountered this great era. Our national industrialists and businessmen unanimously and firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions and join the people of the whole country to form a solid united front against imperialist aggression, to maintain our glory and develop our victory."
    Zhu Jisheng, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "After reading Chairman Mao's reply telegram to our Tianjin business community, we feel very excited and immensely honored. At the same time, we should carefully convey and study this telegram and respond with practical actions, so that we can live up to Chairman Mao's instructions and encouragement. We must further and rapidly launch a large-scale movement to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and repay Chairman Mao's great love for us with practical actions."
    Bian Jieqing, Chairman of Hengyuan Yarn Factory, said: "This time, the Tianjin business community wrote to Chairman Mao at the anti-American and aid-Korea demonstration and parade, and Chairman Mao replied with instructions amidst his busy schedule, which is the supreme glory of Tianjin industrialists and businessmen. We should complete and exceed our production tasks with greater effort and determination."
    Li Zhongchu, Chairman of Danhua Match Company, said: "Chairman Mao's telegram to the Tianjin business community has given us the greatest encouragement. This encouragement is not only felt by industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin, but also by industrialists and businessmen in other major cities. We will unite with the people of the whole country more closely than ever before, strengthen the united front against imperialist aggression, to consolidate the existing glory and to strengthen this great movement."
    Wang Xin'san, Deputy Manager of Dongya Enterprise Company, said: "Chairman Mao's reply telegram gave us great honor. We are determined to take practical actions to consolidate and develop the movement to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, more widely, in a more organized and step-by-step manner."
    Dong Shaochen, Chairman of the Hardware Business Guild, said: "Chairman Mao immediately sent us a reply telegram to express his welcome and give us valuable instructions, which is such a glorious thing for the Tianjin business community. After being valued so much by Chairman Mao, we have strengthened our determination to resist America and aid Korea."
    Jia Tingzhen, Chairman of the Machinery Industry Guild, said: "Chairman Mao's reply telegram made us extremely excited. The American imperialists' deceptive propaganda and despicable intimidation tactics will no longer find a market in the face of our increasingly firm determination. We must continue to study current affairs, improve our understanding, and move forward with our revolutionary friends!"
    Wu Zhengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Flour Industry Guild, said: "After seeing Chairman Mao's reply telegram to us, I was deeply excited, which further encouraged our confidence in sticking to our posts and resolutely striving to achieve the four major tasks."
    Qiao Mingxun, Chairman of the Rubber Industry Trade Association, said: "Seeing Chairman Mao's reply telegram, our industry was greatly encouraged. This makes us further realize that the national bourgeoisie should contribute all its strength at this time, strengthen unity with people of all strata, and consolidate the united front against imperialism to jointly complete the great task of resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country. We will make the greatest efforts in our production posts to improve production and strengthen the economic strength of our motherland. At present, the association is calling on all members of the industry to express our patriotic enthusiasm with the practical action of actively paying industrial and commercial taxes."
    Li Houfu, Chairman of the Tianjin Shipping Industry Association, said: "Seeing Chairman Mao's reply telegram of the 2nd of this month to the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce's anti-American and aid-Korea demonstration and parade, we industrialists and businessmen were very excited! Our shipping industry has always been at the forefront of national defense and has been most deeply oppressed by imperialism. Therefore, we must respond to Chairman Mao's instructions and join the people of the whole country to form a more solid united front against imperialist aggression."
    Feng Baogen, Chairman of the Copper and Ironware Industry Guild, and Li Shenxiang, Vice Chairman, both said that Chairman Mao's commendation had a great impact on the industry. Yesterday, their tax assessment work went very smoothly, and one member voluntarily corrected the originally reported turnover, and the reported figure was more than ten times higher than the original figure.
    Xing Huanqing, Chairman of the Oil Business Guild, said: "Chairman Mao's reply telegram gave us strength and further increased our determination to oppose America. Although my voice is still hoarse from the parade and shouting slogans, I feel very happy in my heart. We businessmen have already recognized the true face of American imperialist aggression. Without resisting America and aiding Korea, we cannot defend our country. If we cannot defend our country, how can we do business with peace of mind? Therefore, we support Chairman Mao's call and will absolutely join the people and do our best to support the movement to resist America and aid Korea."
    Wang Hanqing, Chairman of the Film and Theater Industry Guild, said: "Resisting America and aiding Korea is our firm will. In the future, under Chairman Mao's great call, we will unite all forces to eliminate the crazy aggression of American imperialism. Now our theaters are widely launching a publicity month, hoping to promote the work of resisting America and aiding Korea through this movement."
    Li Yanjun, Chairman of the Tianjin Department Store Owners, Xu Luzhen, Chairman of the Tea Business, Miao Zemin, Chairman of the Chemical Materials Industry, Luo Xizhen, Chairman of the Rope and Hemp Industry, Yuan Zizhen, Vice Chairman of the Ash Coal and Sandstone Industry, Shi Xiangsheng, Chairman of the Fur Business, Hou Shaoting, Manager of the Meilian Trading Company who is currently ill, and Cai Baoru, Manager of the Jianye Bank, all felt excited after reading Chairman Mao's reply telegram. Xu Luzhen, who is ill, said: "I represent the tea business and guarantee to Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country that we will definitely strengthen and consolidate our strength in the future, unite as one, and take practical actions to combat American imperialist aggression."

    津工商界响应毛主席复电
    决遵循指示团结一致抗美援朝
    【新华社天津四日电】据进步日报载：天津市工商界于接获毛主席本月二日给他们的复电后，极为振奋，纷纷表示决遵循毛主席的指示，与人民大众团结一致，为抗美援朝的正义事业的胜利而奋斗。
    正在北京出席民建总会扩大会议的天津工商联合会主委李烛尘以极兴奋的声音对进步日报记者说：这足见毛主席对于我们天津工商界爱国示威游行的重视，这给我们天津工商界以很大的鼓励，也给全中国的工商业者以极大的鼓励。天津工商业者决以实际行动更进一步地推展抗美援朝运动。全国人民对于抗美援朝是具有同样的热情与决心，我相信全国各大工商城市必将作同样表示与行动，这是毫无疑问的。全国工人、农民、知识分子与工商业家，凡属爱国者，都一致团结起来了，为在反对帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争中一定得到最后胜利而奋斗。
    天津市工商业联合会副主任委员毕鸣岐说：毛主席希望我们工商业家和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，对于这个指示我们保证要作到。我们工商业者在解放以前，尝遍了帝国主义与官僚资本主义的压迫，使我们民族工商业者走头无路。今天我们人民的力量赶跑了一切帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派，把我们由黑暗的地狱里挽救出来，走向光明幸福的大道。我们遇到了这个大时代是有多么幸运。我们民族工商业者一致坚决的遵照毛主席的指示与全国人民一道结成巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，以保持我们的光荣，发展我们的胜利。
    天津市工商联副主委朱继圣说：读了毛主席给我们天津工商界的复电，我们觉得非常的兴奋，和无上的光荣。同时，这个电文，我们应该好好地传达和学习，并响应以实际行动，方可以不负毛主席给我们的指示与鼓励。我们要进一步迅速地发动一个大规模的慰劳中国志愿部队及朝鲜人民军的运动，用实际行动来报答毛主席对我们的厚爱。
    恒源纱厂董事长边洁清说：这次本市工商业界抗美援朝示威游行大会上书毛主席，毛主席于日理万机的繁忙中回电指示，这是天津工商业者无上的光荣。我们应当用更大的努力与决心完成并超过生产上的任务。
    丹华火柴公司董事长李钟楚说：毛主席给天津工商界的电报，给我们以最大的鼓舞，这鼓舞不仅是天津这一个城市的工商业者感受到的，就连其他各大城市的工商业者也会受到同样的感动。我们将与全国人民大众一道，比过去更加团结，加强反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，来巩固现有的光荣；来加强这一伟大的运动。
    东亚企业公司副理王新三说：毛主席的回电给了我们很大的光荣，我们决用实际的行动，更广泛地、有组织有步骤地巩固和开展抗美援朝保家卫国运动。
    五金商业公会主委董少臣说：毛主席马上给我们来了复电表示欢迎，并给我们以宝贵的指示，这是天津工商业界多么光荣的事啊。我们工商业界受了毛主席这样重视以后，更加强了我们抗美援朝的决心。
    机器业公会主委贾庭珍说：毛主席的复电使我们万分兴奋。美帝的欺骗宣传和卑鄙的恐吓伎俩，在我们日趋坚强的决心面前将无法再找到市场；我们还要继续学习时事、提高认识，和革命的朋友们一道前进！
    面粉工业公会副主委吴正之说：看见毛主席给我们的复电之后，深为兴奋，这更鼓舞了我们坚守工作岗位，并坚决地为实现四大任务而奋斗的信心。
    橡胶工业同业公会主委乔铭勋说：看到毛主席的复电，本业受到很大的鼓舞，这使我们更进一步体会到民族资产阶级在这个时期，更应贡献出全部的力量，加强与各阶层人民的团结，巩固反对帝国主义的统一战线，来共同完成抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大任务。我们将在生产岗位上尽最大的努力，把生产搞好，加强祖国的经济力量。目前公会正号召同业各会员用踊跃缴纳工商业税的实际行动，来表现我们的爱国热情。
    津市轮船业公会主委李厚甫说：见到毛主席本月二日致天津工商联抗美援朝保家卫国示威大会复电，使我们工商业者非常感奋！我们轮船业向来站在国防第一线，受到帝国主义的压迫也最深。所以我们一定要响应毛主席的指示，与全国人民一道结成一条更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线。
    铜铁器业公会主委封宝根、副主委李慎祥都表示：毛主席的嘉勉，在该业中起了很大的影响。昨天他们进行评税工作就异常顺利，有一家会员自动地纠正了原报的营业额，所报的数字比原来的数额增加了十几倍。
    油商业公会主委邢桓卿说：毛主席的回电给了我们一种力量，更增加了我们反美的决心，游行喊口号，虽然到现在我的嗓子还哑着，但我心里感觉非常痛快，我们买卖人已经认清了美帝国主义侵略的真面目，不抗美援朝，就不能卫国，不能卫国怎么能安心作买卖呢。所以我们拥护毛主席的号召，绝对和人民大众一道，尽全力来支援抗美援朝运动。
    影剧业公会主委王汉卿说：抗美援朝是我们坚决的意志，今后当在毛主席的伟大感召下，更团结一切力量，消灭美帝的疯狂侵略。现在我们影院正广泛展开宣传月，希望通过这一运动推动抗美援朝工作。
    津市百货业主委李彦俊、茶商业主委许鲁真、化学材料工业主委苗泽民、绳麻业主委骆希真、灰煤砂石业副主委袁子真、皮毛商业主委石祥生、正在病中的美联贸易行经理侯少庭、建业银行经理蔡宝儒等读了毛主席的复电，同感兴奋。病中的许鲁真说：我代表茶商业向毛主席保证，向全国人民保证，今后一定更加强巩固我们的力量，团结一致，以实际行动打击美帝侵略。
