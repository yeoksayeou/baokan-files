    Beijing Eight Christian Church Middle Schools' Labor Unions and Student Unions
    Joint Declaration Denounces Austin
    Yuying and Other Schools' Teachers and Students Hold Meetings to Accuse U.S. Imperialism
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The labor unions and student unions of eight schools in Beijing Christian church middle schools, including Beiman, Yuying, Muzhen, Huiwen, Chongci, Chongshi, Duzhi, and Chongde, issued a joint protest declaration on the 8th of this month against Austin's shameless speech in the Security Council. The declaration stated in brief: "We clearly know that U.S. imperialism runs schools in China to carry out cultural aggression, infringe upon China's educational sovereignty, instill imperialist poisonous thoughts, and make Chinese youth forget their motherland, cultivate a national inferiority complex of being pro-American, admiring America, and fearing America, and become loyal slaves of U.S. imperialism generation after generation. This is our personal experience. Therefore, we hate U.S. imperialism even more! We oppose U.S. imperialism! Today, the Chinese people are awake and have stood up. We can no longer tolerate the insult of the warmongering rogue Austin. We will take more practical actions to resist Austin and U.S. imperialism, and actively strive to complete the sacred task of the Chinese people—the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country!"
    [Another Dispatch] Teachers and staff of Beijing Yuying Middle School held a forum to denounce Austin. Teacher Liu Yaoxin said: The so-called "relief" of U.S. imperialism is not to fill the rice bowls of ten million Chinese people, but to break the rice bowls of five hundred million Chinese people. Li Shupei said: "I came to Yuying to teach and only earn seven bags of flour, but American teachers earn twenty-four bags of flour. The treatment is really unequal. Now I know that U.S. imperialism runs schools, not only with soft knives, but also hiding special agents." Cao Shaokong said: "The effect of Austin's speech is counterproductive. This speech makes us hate U.S. imperialism even more." The declaration signed by eighty-two teachers and staff members headed by Nian Jingfeng concluded: "We are educators in church schools. We deeply understand the ambition of U.S. imperialism to run schools in China. Therefore, we resolutely resist the insult of the U.S. imperialist bandit Austin to us. We will take practical actions to resist this slander and deception, and actively carry out ideological education among students to hate, despise, and scorn U.S. imperialism."
    Students from Huiwen Middle School and Chongci Girls' Middle School also held meetings to discuss and expose the crimes of the school's former principal Yuan and U.S. imperialist missionaries.

    京市八个教会中学工会及学生会
    联合宣言痛斥奥斯汀
    育英等校师生分别集会控诉美帝
    【本报讯】北京市基督教教会中学贝满、育英、慕贞、汇文、崇慈、崇实、笃志、崇德等八校工会及学生会对奥斯汀在安理会上无耻演说，于本月八日发表联合抗议宣言。宣言略称：“我们清楚的知道：美帝国主义在中国办学校是进行文化侵略，是侵犯了中国的教育主权，是为了灌输帝国主义的毒害思想，是要使中国青年忘记祖国，养成亲美、崇美、恐美的民族自卑感，一代复一代的变成为美帝的忠实奴隶。这是我们亲身的体会，因此，我们就更加痛恨美帝！反对美帝！今天中国人民觉醒了，站起来了，我们再也不能容忍好战的流氓奥斯汀的侮辱。我们将以更多的实际行动来反抗奥斯汀和美帝国主义，积极为完成中国人民的神圣任务——抗美援朝保家卫国运动而奋斗！”
    【又讯】北京育英中学教职员举行座谈会，痛斥奥斯汀。教员刘曜昕说：美帝之所谓“救济”，不是装满了一千万中国人的饭碗，而是打破了中国五万万人的饭碗。李树培说：“我来育英教书只挣七袋面，美国教员却挣二十四袋面，待遇真不平等，到现在才知道美帝办学校，不仅是软刀子，而且藏特务。”曹绍孔说：“奥斯汀演说所发生的效果适得其反，这演说使我们更恨美帝了。”在以年景丰为首的八十二个教职员签名的宣言中最后说：“我们是教会学校的教育工作者，我们深深体会到美帝国主义在中国办学校的野心。因此，我们坚决反抗美帝强盗奥斯汀对我们的侮辱，我们将以实际行动来反抗这种诬蔑和欺骗，积极地向同学深入进行仇视、鄙视和蔑视美帝的思想教育。”
    汇文中学、崇慈女中同学也纷纷集会讨论，揭露该校前袁校长和美帝传教士的罪恶行为。
