    Quota Management in Shijiazhuang Public Enterprises
    By Zang Boping, Deputy Mayor of Shijiazhuang

    Since liberation in 1947, Shijiazhuang's public enterprises have carried out a democratization movement in factory management and three major production emulation campaigns. Through the democratization of factory management, the enthusiasm of workers has been greatly enhanced. All factories have achieved certain results in improving output and quality, reducing costs, and improving technology, and labor efficiency and production levels have also increased. Most public enterprises strengthened their statistical work during the production emulation campaign in April and May of this year and have initially mastered various figures. Therefore, the city's People's Congress clearly stipulated that the central task of all public enterprises is to implement quota management, and in April and May, in-depth research and discussions were first conducted among cadres of public enterprises. It was decided to focus on piloting this in factories with sufficient raw materials and smooth sales channels.

    When quota management began, due to the lack of clear understanding among leading cadres of various enterprises regarding the idea of ​​relying on workers for democratic quota setting, many obstacles were encountered. At that time, some cadres believed that quota work was complicated and they were not familiar with the business, making it impossible to implement; some emphasized the old and outdated machinery and equipment; and some misunderstood quota work as simply determining numbers. Cadres in non-direct production departments felt that their departments were not suitable for quotas. Due to errors in the understanding of leading cadres, some deviations occurred in the quota work at the beginning. Some units blindly and subjectively formulated quotas without mobilizing workers to deliberate and discuss or carefully studying the actual situation; some wanted to simply use rewards and punishments to urge workers to complete and exceed quotas, causing workers to generally feel that they were not free after quotas were set and were afraid of being punished if they failed to complete them, which prevented them from bringing their production enthusiasm into play. Therefore, the quota work failed to achieve the goal of improving production.

    After discovering this deviation, the city's leadership convened symposiums for leading cadres of various enterprises to exchange experiences, and made special reports at cadre meetings, Party and Youth League activist meetings, and worker congresses. It emphasized relying on workers for democratic quota setting to cadres, and focused on stimulating their sense of ownership and production enthusiasm to workers, explaining that the purpose of quota management was to increase production. After production increases, workers' lives can naturally be gradually improved, making workers clear about the consistency between quota management and their own interests. At the same time, it compiled and printed the advanced experience of quota management in Northeast China, and organized working groups to go deep into the field to provide specific assistance, and quota work gradually unfolded.

    When setting quota standards, the administration first referred to past advanced records and combined with the current production level (that is, the level that most workers can achieve with active production) to formulate a preliminary draft, which was submitted to the Management Committee for discussion and revision, and then submitted to workers in various departments for democratic discussion, revision, and formulation. For those who were not sure, they were first put on trial and then formulated. When the masses had concerns, they would conduct experiments together. For example, in the Fenghang Cigarette Factory, because workers had no confidence in the quota for raw material usage and the quota for steaming tobacco leaves, the factory director went deep into the workshop, participated in actual operations, and worked with workers to conduct research. Party members, Youth League members, and activists also actively took the lead. As a result, they found that the reason for not meeting the quota was the failure to establish a division of labor and responsibility system, as well as slow movements and a lack of tight time control. After finding ways to overcome these problems, the second trial exceeded the quota by 10 percent. The emergence of this vivid example eliminated workers' ideological concerns and encouraged everyone's research enthusiasm. After the initial determination of quotas, most factories first selected production teams in the workshop that could represent the general level for key trials, and then revised individual unsuitable quotas based on the trials before making a final determination. This gave all workers in the workshop confidence in completing the quotas. Experience has shown that if the leadership can respect the opinions of the masses and be careful in formulating quotas, the masses will automatically care about the quotas, bring their production enthusiasm into play, and think of ways to improve the standards of the quotas. For example, Ding Jinglan's group in the forging shop of the Railway Machinery Factory was assigned a labor hour quota of 24 hours to produce 20 bolt palms. The group reported that it could produce 40 bolt palms in the same amount of time, shortening the assigned labor hours by half.

    In the process of formulating quotas, each enterprise determined the focus and order of implementation of the quotas based on the specific conditions of the factory. For example, the Railway Machinery Factory first determined labor hour quotas, the Coking Plant first determined staffing, the Telecommunications Bureau and the Power Bureau focused on quality and quantity, and the Fenghang Cigarette Factory carried out quality, material, and quantity quotas simultaneously. When implementing quota work, each factory also seized the key departments and major operations of the factory. For example, the Fenghang Cigarette Factory focused on the cigarette rolling process, which accounted for more than 70 percent of the total cost, the steam leaf process, which affected the preceding and following production, and the packaging process, which determined the specifications of the products. Among them, the cigarette rolling process mainly focused on material quotas to overcome waste and reduce costs; the steam leaf process mainly focused on quantitative quotas to overcome the disconnection between supply and demand; and the packaging room mainly focused on qualitative quotas to ensure the standardization of products. After the main production departments implemented quota management, they gradually expanded to other departments, which allowed the quota work to break through difficulties and move forward steadily.

    Various factories have gained the following valuable experiences in quotas: (1) Quality is the most important of all quotas, because if the quality does not meet the standards, it will inevitably waste raw materials and labor, and may also affect production due to sales difficulties. (2) Various quotas must be organically coordinated. For example, when setting quantity quotas, the prerequisites of good quality and low cost must also be met, and quantity quotas cannot be carried out in isolation. (3) Labor must be reasonably organized, and appropriate arrangements must be made for surplus workers. Workers' concerns that "the more scientific the management, the higher the labor efficiency, the greater the risk of unemployment" must be eliminated. (4) Once the quotas are determined, they should not be changed frequently; otherwise, workers will easily worry about not being able to keep up with the quotas. Most units tentatively change them once every three months. When the quota standards must be raised through innovation and record-breaking movements, they will be raised again.

    Some units have correctly grasped the reward system in quota work. Instead of emphasizing both rewards and punishments, they first emphasize rewards, which has stimulated workers' production enthusiasm. Experience has shown that after a production upsurge is launched, active workers will automatically demand the establishment of a system that emphasizes both rewards and punishments.

    Combining quota management, various enterprises have established and improved various organizations and systems one after another. For example, in conjunction with quality quotas, organizations and systems for democratic inspection among workers have been established. In conjunction with material quotas, a responsibility system for material purchase and supply has been established, ensuring the quality of raw materials and the timely supply of raw materials. In conjunction with the entire quota, a statistical system has been established. For example, the Fenghang Cigarette Factory recorded production progress in a timely and accurate manner and published it at any time, which strongly stimulated workers' motivation to improve; and because of the establishment of the statistical system, the leadership has been able to grasp the progress of production more accurately, overcoming the blindness of the past. In addition, a responsibility system, a mechanical maintenance system, a labor protection and health system, and an organization for handling rationalization proposals have also been established. Mutual aid contracts and apprenticeship contracts have been established between workers, and contact contracts between various relevant departments have been signed. Therefore, since the implementation of quota management, various units have gradually realized the long-awaited scientific management system, making production enter a regular track. After the quotas were set, because the workers had clear goals to strive for, everyone was unwilling to fall behind, thus launching a warm over-quota movement.

    The implementation of quota management has had a great promoting effect on the production of public enterprises in Shijiazhuang. Various waste phenomena have gradually been overcome. For example, the factories under the Shijiazhuang Enterprise Company, in conjunction with quota management, cleared out a large number of useless materials from the warehouse, with a value of more than 300 million yuan. The public utility expenses of the Telecommunications Bureau exceeded the budget by 15 percent before quotas were set; after quotas were set, they were 29 percent less than the budget. At the end of last year, the Power Bureau consumed an average of 1.79 kilograms of coal per kilowatt-hour; by the end of June of this year, it had been reduced to 1.591 kilograms, saving 1,926 tons of coal in half a year; the cost of electricity sales was reduced from 0.724 jin of rice to 0.618 jin of rice. The Sanlu brand cigarettes produced by the Fenghang Cigarette Factory reduced costs by 4.56 percent, which is equivalent to one month's salary for all employees of the factory. In terms of improving work efficiency and increasing output, the Railway Machinery Factory overfulfilled the first phase of the task assigned by the ministry and won the bonus and flag from the Ministry of Railways. The second phase of the factory's task has also been overfulfilled. The output of the Coking Plant broke the factory's all-time record. The production volume of the Flour Mill increased by 31.57 percent. In terms of improving quality and eliminating accidents, the defective product rate of the Fenghang Cigarette Factory in January of this year was 1.3 percent, which was reduced to 0.5 percent in May. The error rate of the reporting section of the Telecommunications Bureau decreased from 0.55 percent at the beginning of the year to 0.07 percent; the long-distance telephone error rate decreased from 0.45 percent to 0.09 percent; the automatic mechanical failure rate decreased from 2.1 percent to 0.1; and the long-distance line failure rate decreased from an average of 49 times per month to complete elimination. The four factories under the Power Bureau have not had an accident for half a year and have won the bonus, certificate, flag, and circular of commendation from the Electric Power Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department.

    However, there are still individual units that are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards quota management and are not actively and earnestly implementing it. The leading cadres of some enterprises do not have a clear understanding of the idea of ​​relying on workers, have not strengthened the role of the Management Committee, are still limited to general appeals, and lack specific and in-depth leadership. Therefore, the work is progressing slowly and has failed to fully play its role. These shortcomings are now being overcome.

    石家庄市公营企业的定额管理
    石家庄市副市长  臧伯平
    石市公营企业自一九四七年解放以来，曾进行了工厂管理民主化运动和三次大的生产竞赛运动。经过工厂管理民主化运动，职工劳动热情有极大的提高；各厂在提高产、质量，减低成本、技术改进等方面，均获得一定成绩，劳动效率和生产水平亦已提高。大部分公营企业在今年四、五月间的生产竞赛中加强了统计工作，已初步掌握了各种数字。因此，该市人代会遂明确规定各公营企业的中心任务为实行定额管理，并于四、五月间，先在公营企业干部中进行了充分的研究、讨论。决定先在原料充足、销路畅旺的工厂重点试行。
    在开始推行定额管理时，由于各企业领导干部依靠职工民主定额的思想不明确，曾遇到不少阻碍。当时有的干部认为定额工作复杂，自己对业务不熟悉，无法推行；有的强调机器设备老旧；更有的将定额工作误解为单纯确定数字；非直接生产部门的干部则认为自己部门不适合定额。由于领导干部认识上有错误，因而使定额工作在开始时，发生了一些偏向。有的单位盲目主观地去制定定额，不发动职工酝酿讨论，不仔细研究实际情况；有的想单纯用奖惩办法，督促职工完成与超过定额，致使职工普遍认为定额后不自由，怕完不成受处分，发挥不了生产积极性，因此也就使定额工作达不到改进生产的目的。
    该市领导上发现这种偏向后，即召集各企业领导干部座谈，交流经验；并分别在干部会议、党、团员积极分子会议及职工大会上作专题报告。对干部则强调依靠职工民主定额，对职工则着重启发其主人翁思想与生产积极性，说明定额管理的目的是提高生产；生产提高后，职工生活自然逐渐可以改善，使职工明确定额管理与自身利益之一致性。同时汇集编印了东北实行定额管理的先进经验，并组织工作组，深入现场，具体帮助，定额工作因而逐步展开。
    制定定额标准时，系先由行政上参照以往先进纪录，并结合目前生产水平（即大多数职工积极生产能够达到之水平），制定初步草案，提交管委会讨论修正，然后交各部门职工民主讨论，修正制定。对无把握者，则先予试行，然后制定。遇群众有顾虑时，即共同进行试验，如风行烟厂，因职工对原材料使用定额及蒸叶定额无信心，厂长即深入车间，参加实际操作，与工友共同研究，党、团员及积极分子亦积极起带头作用，结果找出达不到定额的原因是没有建立分工负责制，此外尚有动作慢，时间掌握不紧，设法加以克服后，第二次试行即超额百分之十。这一生动的事例出现后，消除了职工思想上的顾虑，鼓励了大家的研究热情。各厂多在定额初步确定后，先选择车间中能代表一般水平的生产小组重点试行，从试行中再修正个别不适合的定额，然后作最后确定。这样使全车间职工都有了完成定额的信心。经验证明，如果领导上能尊重群众意见，能慎重制定定额，群众一定会自动去关心定额，发挥他们生产的积极性，想法去提高定额的标准。如铁路机厂锻工所丁景兰小组打螺丝掌，标定工时原为二十四小时打二十个，该组自报在同一时间内，能打四十个，较标定工时缩短了一半。
    在制定定额过程中，各企业是根据本厂的具体情况，决定定额的重点及推行的先后次序的。如铁路机厂系首先确定工时定额，炼焦厂系首先定员，电信局、电业局以定质与定量为重点，风行烟厂则同时进行定质、定料、定量。推行定额工作时，各厂并抓住了本厂关键部门和主要的作业。如风行烟厂是以占总成本百分之七十以上的卷烟工序和影响前后生产的蒸叶工序及决定产品规格的包装工序为重点。其中卷烟工序又以定料为主，以克服浪费，减低成本；蒸叶工序则以定量为主，来克服供求脱节；包装室以定质为主，以保证产品的规格化。俟主要生产部门实行定额管理后，然后再逐渐扩及到其他部门，这样就可以使定额工作突破困难，稳步前进。
    各厂在定额中得到了以下几点可贵的经验：（一）定质是各项定额中最重要的一项，因为如果质量不合标准，必然使原料、人工都成了浪费，而且有因销售困难、影响生产的可能。（二）各项定额要有有机的配合，例如在定量时，同时要具备质量好、成本低的前提，不能孤立地去进行定量。（三）要合理组织劳动力，对于编余职工要有适当处理。使职工消除“管理愈科学，劳动效率愈高，愈有失业危险”的顾虑。（四）定额确定后，不宜常常变动；不然，职工即易产生赶不上定额的顾虑。各单位大都暂定三个月变动一次。俟通过创新纪录运动，定额标准必须提高时，再予提高。
    部分单位在定额工作中，正确掌握了奖励制度。不是奖惩并提，而是首先强调奖励，因此刺激了职工的生产积极性。经验证明，生产热潮掀起后，职工中的积极分子会自动要求建立奖惩并重的制度。
    各企业结合定额管理，先后建立与健全了各种组织与制度。例如，与定质相结合，建立了职工间民主检查的组织与制度。与定料相结合，建立了材料购置供应负责制，保证了原材料的质量与原材料的及时供应。与整个定额相结合，建立了统计制度。如风行烟厂及时精确的将生产情况记载下来，并随时公布，因而有力地刺激了职工的上进心；又由于统计制度的建立，领导上已能比较精确的掌握生产的进展，克服了以往的盲目性。此外，又建立了责任制，机械检修制、劳保卫生制度以及处理合理化建议的组织。工友间建立了互助合同与师徒合同，签订了各有关部门的联系合同。因此自推行定额管理以来，各单位已逐步实现期望已久的科学管理制度，使生产步入正规。定额制定后，职工们因为有了明确的奋斗目标，大家均不甘落后，因此掀起热烈的超额运动。
    推行定额管理后对石市公营企业的生产，发生了很大的推动作用。各种浪费现象已渐次克服。如市企业公司所属各厂结合定额管理，从仓库中清理出大批无用的物资，价值在三亿元以上。电信局的公杂费开支，在定额前，超过预算百分之十五；定额后，反较预算少百分之二十九。电业局在去年年终，平均每度电耗煤一点七九公斤，至今年六月末，已减至一点五九一公斤，半年节煤一九二六吨；售电成本由○点七二四斤米，降至○点六一八斤米。风行烟厂所产三鹿牌烟，减低成本百分之四点五六，等于该厂全体职工一个月的工资。在提高工作效率，增加产量方面，铁路机厂超额完成了部订第一期任务，荣获铁道部的奖金与奖旗。该厂第二期任务亦超额完成。炼焦厂的产量突破了该厂有史以来的纪录。面粉厂生产量提高了百分之三十一点五七。在提高质量、消灭事故方面，风行烟厂今年一月份的次品率为百分之一点三，五月份减至百分之○点五。电信局报务股差错。由年初的百分之○点五五，减至百分之○点○七；长途话务差错由百分之○点四五，减至百分之○点○九；自动机械障碍率由百分之二点一，降至百分之○点一，长途线路障碍率由平均每月四十九次至全部消灭。电业局所属四厂已半年未发生事故，荣获中央燃料工业部电业管理总局的奖金、奖状、奖旗及通令表扬。
    但目前尚有个别单位，对定额管理仍抱观望态度，不积极认真推行。部分企业的领导干部对依靠工人的思想还不明确，未加强管委会的作用，仍局限于一般的号召，缺乏具体深入的领导，因此工作进行迟缓，未能充分发生作用。这些缺点现正克服中。
