    Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles Demonstration and Parade Meeting
    Telegraphed Respects to Chairman Mao
    [Report from this newspaper] The Beijing industrial and commercial circles held a celebration of the liberation of Pyongyang and a demonstration and parade against American imperialist aggression, and sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. The original telegram is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    We, the industrial and commercial figures of the capital, who have stood up under your leadership and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, today held a demonstration and parade celebrating the liberation of Pyongyang and opposing American imperialist aggression against Korea and our country's Taiwan. We firmly remember your words: "All patriotic industrialists and businessmen in China, together with the broad masses of the people, have formed a united front against imperialist aggression that is even more consolidated than in the past. This foretells that the Chinese people are bound to win final victory in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression."
    We express extreme contempt and indignation at the series of shameless and intimidating speeches and statements made by warmongers such as Truman, Acheson, and MacArthur after their disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield! Our demonstration and parade today is to show that we will never be deceived or intimidated by American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang bandit gang! We, the industrialists and businessmen of the capital, pledge to fight to the end to fulfill the five patriotic covenants that we have voluntarily stipulated to support the front lines and consolidate the rear! We extend our highest respects.

    京工商界示威游行大会
    电毛主席致敬
    【本报讯】北京市工商界庆祝平壤解放反对美帝侵略示威游行大会电毛主席致敬。原电如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在您和中国共产党领导之下站立起来了的我们首都工商业者，今天举行了庆祝平壤解放反对美帝侵略游行示威大会，坚决反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和我国的台湾。我们牢牢地记住了您的话：“全中国一切爱国的工商业家，和人民大众一道，结成一条比过去更加巩固的反对帝国主义侵略的统一战线，这就预示着中国人民在反对帝国主义侵略的神圣斗争中一定要得到最后胜利。”
    我们对于杜鲁门、艾奇逊、麦克阿瑟等战争贩子在朝鲜战场惨败之后所发表的一连串无耻的恫吓性的讲演和声明，表示极端鄙视和愤慨！我们今天举行的示威大游行，就是表示我们决不受美帝及其走狗国民党匪帮的任何欺骗和恐吓！我们首都工商业者誓为实践我们自己志愿规定的支援前线、巩固后方的五项爱国公约而奋斗到底！谨致崇高的敬礼
