Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: Under the heavy blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the American aggressors are falling into panic and confusion.

    According to a French Press Agency dispatch from Tokyo on the 3rd, the U.S. troops invading Korea are unable to withstand the powerful offensive of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and are only trying to "avoid" being "completely annihilated." The news agency admitted that the "connection between the east and west line forces of the U.S. troops invading Korea has been cut off. There is no such thing as a battle line anymore, only a few isolated troops in enemy territory. Their fate is becoming increasingly critical." An Associated Press reporter even revealed the sorrow of the American aggressors regarding their strategic situation in Korea. He said that the U.S. invading forces had suffered a "devastating blow" and "there is no hope of stopping it in sight." Now the "United Nations" forces have been "split in two." "The Eighth Army in the west and the Tenth Corps in the east are both fighting for their lives. No one can immediately rescue the other."

    On the western front, the U.S. invading forces are collapsing again and again. According to an Associated Press reporter, as of the evening of the 4th, this rout "has been going on for a whole week." "The road south from Pyongyang is filled with a retreating army on a massive scale. A torrent of troops, trucks, artillery, and heavy equipment is pouring down the dusty road, moving backward." Although a Reuters reporter described this rout as "trading space and lives for time," he still had to admit: "The shadow of military disaster still hangs over them."

    The fate of the "United Nations" forces "depends entirely on whether they can run faster than the enemy." Words such as "frowning," "anxious," and "overly pessimistic" fill the dispatches of American and British reporters who were desperately boasting about the "brilliant achievements" of the invading forces a month ago. A United Press reporter revealed a typical example of the U.S. invading forces fleeing in disgrace. The U.S. Army's 2nd Engineer Battalion retreated on foot for forty miles in thirty-six hours amidst artillery fire and snow. "They hadn't eaten and had waded across two rivers, and when they waded across the rivers, the water froze on them." When they stopped, they all looked "like standing dead men." Moreover, "many people were killed in action." For example, when Lieutenant Maro led a group of people to flee, "he would encounter Communist snipers every forty-five minutes." He "started with sixteen people, but only four were left." This kind of rout "is a painful and depressing experience" for the American bandits, and "where to establish a defense line after this retreat is still unknown."

    On the eastern front, the situation of the two divisions of the U.S. invading forces' Tenth Corps (the 1st Marine Division and the 7th Infantry Division) has been found by the Associated Press reporter, who was hyping them up as they scurried to the Yalu River half a month ago, to be "increasingly unfavorable" and "more dangerous than the Eighth Army." The reporter said sadly: The American bandits of these two divisions "may only be able to avoid being annihilated by another Dunkirk." "Their fate depends entirely on God's blessing." A U.S. Marine Corps colonel said sadly: "We know we are surrounded. We have been beaten and will be beaten again." Those war-mongering groups who were arrogant because of the temporary success of the war of aggression against Korea have now tasted the iron fist of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. MacArthur Headquarters "realizes that the sense of crisis is coming, spreading like smog." The Associated Press reporter said bluntly: "MacArthur Headquarters believes that the Allies (referring to the United States and its accomplice countries) have been nailed to a snow-covered battlefield. ... No American commander can ignore the impact of panic and despair on his army. These young people are involved in a war they don't fully understand and don't need." "Responsible persons" in Washington also helplessly admitted that the U.S. invading forces "have lost control of the military situation in Korea and can no longer hope to hold any defense line across the Korean Peninsula." The reactionary New York Times military editor Baldwin sadly wrote: "The war we are involved in today is a war we can never win."

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: Under the powerful blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, pessimistic and disappointed emotions are rapidly growing among the U.S. invading forces. According to reports from Korea and Tokyo: The American troops fleeing in disgrace southward on the western front of Korea "have not indicated how far they will retreat before they can try to form a new defense line." American soldiers and officers are "all anxious" and "frowning" as they worry that the American army "will be driven out of Korea." Whiteherd, a reporter for the American reactionary news agency Associated Press, wrote sadly in a dispatch sent from the front on the 2nd: "Those desperate days of July and August are approaching again. But this time the scale is larger, more lives, more equipment, and a large number of stored supplies are thrown into it. ... This time it is seven U.S. divisions, two British brigades, one Turkish brigade, and other United Nations forces. They have been severely hit. Their combat effectiveness has been reduced due to heavy casualties. The bright hope of a quick victory has disappeared into the bleak gray of defeat." After summarizing the defeats of the U.S. invading forces, the dispatch said: "All this has happened in the past nightmarish seven days. This nightmare is indeed real, tragically real beyond imagination."

Even in MacArthur Headquarters in Tokyo, which originally dreamed of destroying Korea before Christmas, it is full of anxious and uneasy ugliness. According to a dispatch from the American reactionary news agency on the 1st: There, "the lights have been on all night these days, and the generals are busier and more serious than at any other time in the Korean War. ... The joyful appearance a month ago has completely disappeared." MacArthur is fidgety, "walking slowly around the room on the sixth floor of the Dai-ichi building in Tokyo with a pipe in his hand."

    无法抵挡朝人民军与我志愿部队强大攻势
    侵朝美军恐慌混乱悲哀沮丧
    华盛顿“负责人士”承认美军已无希望守住任何防线
    【新华社六日讯】在朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队的重重打击下，美国侵略者正陷于恐慌和混乱。
    据法国新闻社东京三日电透露，侵朝美军已无法抵挡朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队的强大攻势，只能力图“避免”“被完全歼灭”。该通讯社承认，侵朝美军“东线部队与西线部队的联系，目前已被切断。那里已没有像战线这样的一种东西了，所存在的仅是在敌国领土上的若干孤立的部队而已。它们的命运已日趋危急”。美联社记者更道出了美国侵略者对其在朝鲜所处的战略形势的悲哀。他说：美侵略军遭受了“毁灭性打击”，“目前还看不见有停止的希望”。现在“联合国”军已被“割裂为二”。“西面的第八军与东面的第十兵团，都在为被毁灭的命运而战。谁也无力立即援救另一个。”
    在西线，美侵略军正一溃再溃。据美联社记者说，至四日晚止，这种溃退“已整整一星期”。“从平壤往南的路上，塞满了一支大规模撤退的败退的军队。在尘土飞扬的道路上，倾泻着军队、卡车、炮和重装备所形成的洪流，向后移动”。路透社记者尽管把这种溃败说成是“以空间和生命换取时间”，但他仍不得不承认：“军事灾难的阴影仍然笼罩着他们”。
    “联合国”军的命运，“完全要靠他们是否能比敌军跑得快来决定”。“愁眉苦脸”、“提心吊胆”、“过分悲观”等字样充满了一个月以前曾拚命吹嘘侵略军“赫赫战果”的美英记者的电讯中。合众社记者透露了美国侵略军溃逃的一个典型狼狈的例子。美军工兵第二营于三十六小时内在炮火阻击和冰雪中步行溃退了四十英里。“他们一直没有吃饭，并涉水渡过两道河，当他们涉水渡河时，河水就冻在他们身上了。”当他们停下来以后，个个都“像站着的死人一样”。而且“有许多人阵亡了”。例如少尉马罗带领的一组人在溃逃时，“不出四十五分钟总要碰上共产党狙击兵”，他“带着十六个人出发，但剩下的只有四个人”。这种溃退，对于美国匪徒说来，“是一种痛苦的而且令人沮丧的经验”，而且“在这次撤退以后，将在什么地方建立防线，现在还不知道”。
    在东线，美侵略军第十兵团两个师（海军陆战队第一师与步兵第七师）的处境，已为在半个月以前替他们窜到鸭绿江边大吹大擂的美联社记者发觉“越来越不利”，“比第八军更危险”。这位记者如此伤心地说：这两个师的美国匪徒，“或许只有另一次敦克尔刻才能避免被歼灭。”“他们的命运如何，完全靠天保佑了。”美海军陆战队的一个上校悲哀地说：“我们知道我们被包围了。我们已经挨了一顿打，并且还要挨打。”那些曾因侵朝战争的一时得手而狂妄跋扈的战争贩子集团，现在已尝到了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的铁拳的滋味。麦克阿瑟总部“了解到危机已经到来的感觉，正像油烟一样地散布着”。美联社记者毫不隐讳地说：“麦克阿瑟总部认为：盟国（按指美国及其帮凶国家）已被钉在一个冰天雪地的战场上。……没有一个美国司令官忽视惊慌和沮丧对他的军队的影响，这些青年人被牵涉在一个他们不十分了解，而且是他们所不需要的战争里”。华盛顿的“负责人士”也无可奈何地承认：美侵略军“已经丧失了对朝鲜军事局势的控制，并且无法再希望横越朝鲜半岛守住任何一道防线”。反动的纽约时报军事主笔鲍尔温悲哀地写道：“今天我们所陷入的一个战争，正是一个我们永不能打胜的战争。”
    【新华社五日讯】在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的有力打击下，美国侵略军中正迅速增长着悲观失望的情绪。据朝鲜与东京消息报道：在朝鲜西线向南狼狈逃窜的美军，“没有表示他们要撤退多远才能设法组成新的防线”。美国大兵们和军官们，“每一个人都提心吊胆”，他们“愁眉苦脸地”担忧美军“会被赶出朝鲜”。美国反动通讯社美联社记者怀特亥在二日从前线发出的一条消息中悲哀地写道：“七月和八月那些绝望的日子又在走近。但是这一次规模更大了，更多的生命、更多的装备、大批存储的供应品投在这里面。……这一次是美国七个师同英国两个旅、土耳其一个旅和其他联合国部队。他们已经受到严重打击。他们的战斗效能已因重大的伤亡而低落。迅速取得胜利的光明的希望，黯然消失在阴沉灰色的失败里。”这条消息在综述了美国侵略军的败绩后说：“所有这一切都发生在过去恶梦似的七天里，这场恶梦确是真的，无法可想地像悲剧一样地真实。”
    甚至在原来梦想在圣诞节以前灭亡朝鲜的东京麦克阿瑟总部里，也充满了焦急不安的丑态。据美国反动通讯社一日电透露：那里，“这几天灯火通宵，将官们比在朝鲜战事中的任何其他时候都要忙些和严肃些。……一个月以前那种兴高采烈的样儿是完全消失了。”麦克阿瑟则是烦躁地“一个人手上拿着烟斗，在东京第一大厦的第六层楼房间内慢慢地踱来踱去。”
