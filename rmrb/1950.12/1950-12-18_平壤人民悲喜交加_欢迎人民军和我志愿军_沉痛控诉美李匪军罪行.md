Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Our correspondent reports from Pyongyang: The people of Pyongyang, with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow, welcomed the victorious return of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers through tear-filled eyes. The vanguard units of the Korean People's Army and our Chinese People's Volunteers entered Pyongyang city at approximately 10:00 AM on the 6th. Welcome slogans were already posted on the walls. The citizens had guessed from the enemy's words that the Chinese People's Volunteers had joined forces with the Korean People's Army, and from the panicked escape of the American and Li Seung-man bandit troops, they knew of the victorious counter-offensive of the Chinese and Korean people's armies. All the slogans displayed the people's welcome and gratitude towards these two fraternal forces, and paid tribute to Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Kim Il-sung. When the troops entered the city, the people of Pyongyang stood in the streets, shook hands with the soldiers, offered tea, water, and fruit, and voluntarily helped the troops cook. Many citizens, especially women, wept bitterly upon seeing the troops, recounting the crimes of the American invading army and the Li Seung-man bandit gang. The crimes of the American and Li Seung-man bandit gangs are too numerous to count and are currently impossible to fully account for. According to initial investigations, the American and Li Seung-man bandit gangs massacred over 12,000 people in Pyongyang. When the reporter entered Pyongyang, piles of corpses were found everywhere on Daedong River Island, with thirty to fifty corpses in each pile. Most of the dead were women and children, some of the women had their lower bodies stabbed and mutilated by bayonets. The gruesome scene was infuriating. When the American and Li Seung-man bandit troops fled Pyongyang, they blew up the Daedong River bridge, power plants, trains, warehouses, and other facilities. Prominent buildings and cultural institutions in Pyongyang, such as Kim Il-sung University, the Supreme People's Assembly Building, the National Opera and Ballet Theatre, and the Junghwa Hospital, were all burned down. Currently, Pyongyang is plunged into darkness at night, and citizens go to the Daedong River to fetch water for cooking. After entering the city, the local government agencies of Korea immediately posted notices to reassure the people, and various tasks are being restored in order. The garrison headquarters has also been established, and order has been restored throughout the city. Although enemy planes are constantly circling overhead, dropping bombs, and strafing, and fires are burning everywhere, the people of Pyongyang are calmly restoring their normal lives.

    沉痛控诉美李匪军罪行
    【新华社十七日讯】本社记者自平壤报道称：平壤人民怀着悲喜交加的心情在泪眼中欢迎胜利归来的朝鲜人民军和我国人民志愿军。朝鲜人民军和我人民志愿军的先头部队于六日上午十时许进入平壤市内，墙壁上已经贴满了欢迎标语。市民们从敌人口中猜到了中国人民志愿军已与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，并从美李匪军的狼狈逃窜，知道了中朝人民军队的胜利反攻。所有的标语都显示了人民对这两支兄弟般的部队的欢迎与感激，并向毛泽东主席与金日成首相致敬。部队入城时，平壤人民站立街头，与战士们握手，纷纷送茶、送水、送水果，自动帮助部队煮饭。许多市民，尤其是妇女，见到部队就痛哭流涕，哭诉美国侵略军与李承晚匪帮的罪行。美李匪帮的罪行实擢发难数，目前尚无法清算。据初步了解，美李匪帮在平壤屠杀人民达一万二千以上。记者进入平壤时，大同江岛上处处发现尸堆，每处三五十不等。死者中多妇女小孩，有的妇女下体已被刺刀戳烂，情状之惨，令人切齿。美李匪军逃离平壤时，将大同江江桥、水电厂、列车、仓库等均予炸毁。平壤有名的大建筑与文化机关建筑，如金日成大学、最高人民议会大厦、国立歌舞剧场及中和医院等，全部被焚毁。现平壤市入夜即一片漆黑，市民均往大同江挑水做饭。朝鲜地方政府各机关入城后，立即张贴布告，安定人心，各种工作均在次第恢复。警备司令部亦已建立，全市秩序业已恢复。虽然敌机不断在上空盘旋投弹、扫射，到处在燃烧，但平壤人民正在镇定地恢复他们的正常生活。
