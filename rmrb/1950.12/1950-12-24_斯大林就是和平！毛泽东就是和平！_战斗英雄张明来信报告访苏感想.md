    "Stalin is Peace! Mao Zedong is Peace!"
    Combat Hero Zhang Ming Writes Letter Reporting Impressions of Visit to Soviet Union
    [Reported by this newspaper]: Combat hero Comrade Zhang Ming, who attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes, went abroad with the Chinese Youth Delegation to the Soviet Union. He recently wrote a letter from Moscow to his superiors and all comrades, reporting his observations. The original letter is reprinted below:
    To respected superiors and all comrades:
    I am very excited to report to the superiors and comrades that I, along with the Chinese Youth Delegation to the Soviet Union, arrived in Moscow, the capital of the great socialist country of the Soviet Union, which I have long admired, on the 30th. Along the way, we received warm welcomes from the people of ten major cities. Their enthusiasm for the Chinese representatives and the Chinese People's Liberation Army was unparalleled. In Novosibirsk, I was lifted up by people, thrown into the air, caught, and thrown into the air again, seven or eight times in a row. They shouted, "Hurrah!" I didn't understand a word, but I was very touched by this kind of kindness and enthusiasm. Children tied their own red scarves around my neck; members of the Communist Youth League took off their own badges and pinned them on us; sometimes the flowers they presented were too many to hold in both hands. I felt like I wanted to speak, but I couldn't, because they wouldn't understand, and I could only say one sentence: "Spasibo (thank you)!" My right hand shook theirs forcefully, and every time after a welcome, when I returned to the train, my hand felt sore. Especially the Red Army soldiers, they were really energetic. This energy expressed their feelings. We were like friends who had not seen each other for many years reuniting. Because of the language barrier, they could only hold both hands together to show us, which probably meant the close unity of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. This great friendship cannot be fully expressed in this letter.
    My health is very good, and I am accustomed to all aspects of life in the Soviet Union. Although the climate is cold, we are not freezing, and we live in good houses with heating. Every Soviet person has such good houses to live in and has leather clothing, which shows how happy their lives are. Today we visited their stadium for a football competition. In such cold weather, they were wearing only single layers, and they were all very healthy.
    Comrades! In every city we passed through, people shouted: "Defend peace!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live Stalin!" They said: "Stalin is peace! Mao Zedong is peace!" Whenever we mentioned the names of these two leaders in our speeches, they responded with warm and sustained applause. They regard the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the same way as the Soviet Red Army, considering it a powerful and invincible army, a strong main force in defending peace. From their speeches and welcomes, I deeply realized that only when our strength is stronger and we have full preparations for anti-aggression war can we truly defend peace.
    I wish the superiors and all comrades good health. Sending distant greetings!
          Zhang Ming, October 31st, Moscow

    “斯大林就是和平！毛泽东就是和平！”
    战斗英雄张明来信报告访苏感想
    【本报讯】：出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的战斗英雄张明同志，随中国访苏青年代表团出国，最近他从莫斯科写信给他的首长和全体同志，报告他的观感。原信转载如下：××首长和全体同志们：
    我很兴奋地报告首长和同志们，我已随同中国访苏青年代表团在三十日到达了久已仰慕的伟大的社会主义国家苏联京城莫斯科。沿路受到十个大城市人民的热烈欢迎。他们对中国的代表和中国人民解放军是热情无比。在新西伯利亚城，我被人们架起来，抛在空中，然后接住，又抛在空中，接连了七、八次。他们欢呼：“乌啦！”说的什么，我是一句不懂，可是这种亲切、热情，我却很受感动。儿童们把他们自己的红领巾，给我系在脖子上；青年团员们把他们自己的徽章，摘下来给我们挂上；有时献的花两只手抱也抱不了；我感觉得光想说话，就是不能说，因为说了他们也不懂，只会说一句：“斯巴西巴（谢谢）”！我的右手和他们用力的握，每次欢迎完毕，回到列车上，就觉得手发痛。特别是红军战士们，他们是真有劲。这劲就是表达着他们的感情。我们之间就像好多年不见的朋友又相逢了的一样。因言语不通，他们只有把两只手握在一块向我们表示，这大概就是中苏两大国亲密团结的意思。这种伟大的友谊，这信上是说不完写不尽的。
    我的身体很好，对苏联一切生活还习惯，气候虽冷，可是我们冻不着，我们住的是有暖气设备的好的房子。每个苏联人民都有这样好的房子住，都有皮衣，可以看出他们的生活多么幸福。今天我们就参观了他们运动场的足球竞赛，这样冷的天他们穿的是单衣，个个都健康得很。
    同志们！我们路过的每个城市，人们都高喊着：“保卫和平！”“毛泽东万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”他们说：“斯大林就是和平！毛泽东就是和平！”当我们讲话每提起这两位领袖的名字时，他们就报以阵热烈地经久不息地鼓起掌来。他们对中国人民解放军像对苏联红军一样的看法，认为是一支强大无敌的军队，是一支保卫和平的坚强的主力军。从他们讲话与欢迎中，我深深认识到：只有我们的力量越强大和有充分的反侵略战争的准备，才能真正保卫和平。
    祝首长和全体同志们健康。致遥远的敬礼！
          张明  十月三十一日于莫斯科
