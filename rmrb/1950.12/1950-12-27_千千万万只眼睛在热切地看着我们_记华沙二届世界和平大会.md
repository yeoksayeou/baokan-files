    A Thousand Million Eyes Are Ardently Watching Us
    Remembering the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw
    Peng Di
    "Are you Chinese or Korean?" This was a question that Chinese representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress often encountered abroad. Chinese and Koreans look very similar; China and Korea face each other across a river; and the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people fought side by side against American imperialist aggression, which has firmly united these two great nations, becoming banners for defending world peace with their lives and blood. All peace-loving people see representatives of the Chinese or Korean people as their own relatives, and they associate Chinese people with Koreans, and Koreans with Chinese.
    The Chinese and Korean delegations traveled to Warsaw on the same train, and along the way, they were warmly welcomed by the Polish people. At every station, hundreds and thousands of Polish people crowded the platforms, waving bright and dazzling flags, and shouting "Welcome!" "Long Live Peace!" On the station buildings, we saw portraits of Chairman Mao, Stalin, Kim Il-sung, and Polish President Bierut hanging together.
    The train passed many stations without stopping, and what was most touching was that the platforms at these stations were also crowded with Polish people in various costumes, shouting "Long Live!" towards the speeding train. But the train was moving too fast, and we could only look through the train windows, moved, at these enthusiastic and lovely Polish people, paying our respects from afar. For this one or two seconds of meeting, to express their sincere welcome to us, they may have walked a long way to the station, waiting in the cold wind for several hours.
    On the streets of Warsaw, in the shops, in the theaters, inside and outside the meeting hall, the Chinese and Korean representatives were often surrounded by people. They warmly asked to shake hands with us, exchange souvenirs, sign autographs... Once I went to a state-owned shop in Warsaw to buy something, and there I was once again surrounded by many lovely children who asked me to sign their autograph books. I didn't buy anything when I left the store, but I was very happy, because the sincere friendship I got from these innocent and lovely Polish children cannot be bought with any money. Before leaving, one child gave me his only Polish Young Pioneer commemorative badge.
    Few foreigners understand Chinese, but people all over the world can say three Chinese characters - "Mao Zedong". They often express their love and respect for the Chinese people by continuously shouting "Mao Zedong". This name, familiar and respected by people all over the world, has become a common language for friendly exchanges between people from other countries and Chinese representatives. This great name itself is a force that unites us with peace-loving and democratic people from other countries.
    At the Peace Congress, the seats of the Chinese and Korean delegations were next to each other.
    This conference was held under the serious situation caused by the US imperialists launching a war of aggression in Korea and occupying Taiwan. War is not only a threat, but has already become a reality. Under this situation, the focus of the conference had to first fall on the issues of US imperialist aggression against Korea and Taiwan. Here I personally saw how the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the righteous action of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea were warmly supported by peace-loving people all over the world, and at the same time, how important an influence and encouragement they had on the world peace movement.
    At the meeting on November 18, Guo Moruo, the head of the Chinese delegation, in his speech, sternly condemned the aggression of American imperialism. When he declared to the conference: "We cannot sit idly by while the Korean people are suffering... In order to defend Asian and world peace, we must resist American aggression to the end," he received a long and thunderous applause from the entire audience.
    Park Jung-ai, the head of the Korean delegation, used ironclad facts to accuse the American imperialists of the atrocities they committed in Korea, which were more brutal and inhuman than those of Hitler. Every fact, every number, every sentence, every word she listed was deeply imprinted in the hearts of the listeners. Many mothers in the audience shed tears. The atmosphere of the whole audience was filled with hatred and contempt for the American imperialists. This was not just an indictment, but a sentence, declaring the death sentence of the American imperialists morally in front of the people of the world.
    When Park Jung-ai spoke about the Korean people's fighting will and confidence with the support of the world's peace forces, the atmosphere of the conference changed from grief and anger to strength. She said: "The Korean people firmly believe in their victory, because the finest sons and daughters of the great Chinese people, their neighbor, have formed a volunteer army to support the Korean people, promote the fraternal friendship between these two great nations, and oppose the aggressors. If this aggressor conquers Korea, they will further conquer China, this aggressor has already been slaughtering Chinese people." Stormy applause shook the entire building, and the eyes of the audience were focused on the Chinese representatives. From these countless eyes, I saw excitement, enthusiasm, admiration, gratitude and hope. Yes, peace-loving people all over the world feel infinitely encouraged and place infinite hope in the heroic and righteous actions of our Chinese people. We have bravely taken on this glorious task - resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. This is the most effective way for the Chinese people to defend peace, and it is also our greatest contribution to the cause of peace.
    When Park Jung-ai finished her vivid and powerful speech, women representatives from many countries rushed up to hug her and kiss her. Other representatives also quickly gathered around, some offering flowers, some giving gifts, some taking off their most beautiful commemorative badges and pinning them on her chest, and some even lifting her up high. The Chinese representatives even carried her to the seats of the Chinese delegation, and the whole audience surrounded her and shouted "Long Live the Korean People!" "Kim Il-sung!" This name resounded throughout the venue. The representatives gathered closer and closer, all wanting to shake her hand, give her a gift, or say a word or two of thanks to her. Because it was this Korean woman leader in white who represented the country that was bravely resisting the frenzied attack of American imperialism on the front line of the peace front!
    The representatives standing in the back were all standing on tiptoes and craning their necks to see this heroic representative of the Korean people, some climbing on chairs to see, some climbing on tables, waving to her and shouting Kim Il-sung. Applause and cheers lasted for several tens of minutes, and many people were moved to tears.
    This was a great scene. For the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, this was the most powerful encouragement, and for the warmongers, it was a powerful demonstration! The people of the world stand with us, and victory will surely belong to us!

    千千万万只眼睛在热切地看着我们
    记华沙二届世界和平大会
    彭迪
    “你是中国人，还是朝鲜人？”这是出席第二届世界和平大会的中国代表在国外常常遇到的一个问题。中国人和朝鲜人长得很像；中国和朝鲜隔江相望；中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民为了反对美国帝国主义侵略而并肩作战更使得这两大民族牢牢地结合在一起，成为了用生命和鲜血来捍卫世界和平的旗帜。一切爱好和平的人民见到了中国或朝鲜人民的代表就像看见了自己的亲人，而且他们看到中国人就联想起朝鲜人，看到朝鲜人就联想到中国人。
    中国和朝鲜代表团是乘同一列火车到华沙的，沿途他们一同受到波兰人民热烈的欢迎。在每一个车站，成千成百的波兰人民挤在月台上，扬着鲜明夺目的旗帜，高呼着“欢迎！”“和平万岁！”在车站的建筑物上，我们看到毛主席、斯大林、金日成和波兰总统贝鲁特的肖像挂在一起。
    火车经过了好些车站并没有停，最令人感动的是在这些车站的月台上同样是挤满了穿着各式各样服装的波兰人民，向着疾驶而过的火车高呼“万岁！”但是火车走的太快，我们只能隔着车窗，感动地看着这些热情可爱的波兰人民，遥遥致敬。为了这一两秒钟的会见，为了表示他们对我们的竭诚的欢迎，他们也许走了好些路来到车站，在寒风中等待了好几个钟头。
    在华沙的街头，在商店里，在戏院中，在会场里外，中国和朝鲜的代表经常被人们所包围。他们亲切地要求和我们握手，交换纪念品，签名……。有一次我去华沙一个国营商店买东西，在那里我又一次的被许多可爱的小朋友们所包围，要求我在他们的签名簿上签名。离开商店的时候我没有买到什么东西，但是我很高兴，因为从这些天真可爱的波兰小孩们所得的真挚的友情，不是任何金钱可以买得到的。临走的时候，一个小孩将他自己仅有的一个波兰少先队的纪念章送给我了。
    外国人很少懂中国话的，但是全世界的人民都会说三个中国字——“毛泽东”。他们常常用连续不断地高呼“毛泽东”来表达他们对中国人民的爱戴和尊敬。这个为全世界人民所熟悉和敬爱的名字便成为了其他国家的人和中国代表间友情交流的共同语言了。这个伟大的名字本身就是一种力量把我们和其他国家热爱和平民主的人民团结在一起。
    在和平大会上，中国和朝鲜代表团的席位是连在一起的。
    这次和大是在美帝在朝鲜发动侵略战争和侵占台湾所造成的严重形势下召开的。战争不仅是一种威胁，而且已经成为事实。在这种形势下和大讨论的重点不得不首先落在美帝侵略朝鲜和台湾等问题上。在这里我亲眼看到了朝鲜人民英勇斗争和中国人民的抗美援朝的正义行动是如何被全世界爱好和平人民所热烈支持，而同时对于世界和平运动又起了如何重大的影响和鼓舞。
    在十一月十八日的会议上，中国代表团团长郭沫若的发言痛斥了美国帝国主义的侵略。当他向大会宣告：“朝鲜人民遭受着灾难我们不能坐视不理……我们为了保卫亚洲和世界和平，必须把美国的侵略反抗到底”的时候，获得全场经久不息的掌声。
    朝鲜代表团团长朴正爱的发言，用铁的事实控诉了美国帝国主义在朝鲜所干的比希特勒更残暴更绝灭人性的兽行。她所列举的每件事实，每一个数字，每一句话，每一个字都深深地刻印在听众的心坎中。许多在场的母亲们都流着眼泪。全场的气氛充满了对美帝的仇恨和卑视。这不只是一篇控诉书，而是一篇判决书，在全世界人民面前，在道义上宣判了美国帝国主义者的死刑。
    当朴正爱说到朝鲜人民在世界和平力量支持下的斗争意志和信心时，会场的空气就从悲愤转变为力量。她说：“朝鲜人民深信他们的胜利，因为他们的邻邦伟大的中国人民的最优秀的儿女已经成立了志愿部队，支援朝鲜人民，发扬这两大民族间的兄弟的友谊，反对侵略者。这个侵略者如果征服了朝鲜以后，还会进一步要征服中国，这个侵略者早已在屠杀着中国老百姓。”暴风雨似的掌声震动了整个大厦，听众的眼睛都集中在中国代表们身上。从这无数的眼睛中，我看到了兴奋、热情、钦佩、感激和希望。是的，全世界爱好和平的人民对于我们中国人民的英勇正义行动是感到无限的鼓舞和寄予了无限的希望。我们已经英勇地担负起这一个光荣的任务——抗美援朝。这是中国人民保卫和平最有效的办法，也是我们对于和平事业最伟大的贡献。
    当朴正爱结束了她的生动有力的讲话时，许多国家的妇女代表们一拥而上，拥抱她，吻她。其他的代表们也都赶紧围拢来，有的献花，有的送礼，有的把自己最美丽的纪念章摘下来佩在她胸前，还有的把她高高的举起来。中国的代表更把她举到中国代表团的席位上，全场围着她高呼“朝鲜人民万岁！”“金日成”这个名字响彻了整个会场。代表们愈围愈拢，谁都想和她握握手，送点礼物给她，或是向她说一两句感谢的话。因为正是这个身穿白衣的朝鲜妇女领袖所代表的国家，正在和平阵线的最前线英勇地抗击着美国帝国主义的疯狂进攻！
    站在后面的代表都踮着脚尖伸着脖子要看看这位英勇的朝鲜人民代表，有的爬到椅子上看，有的爬上了桌子，向她招手，高呼金日成。掌声和欢呼延续了几十分钟，许多人都感动得流泪。
    这是一个伟大的场面。对于朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿部队，这是一个最有力的鼓舞，对于战争贩子是一个有力的示威！全世界人民和我们站在一起，胜利必然是属于我们的！
