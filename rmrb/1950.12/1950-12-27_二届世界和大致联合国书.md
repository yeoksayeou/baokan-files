    The Second World Peace Congress' Letter to the United Nations. The full text is as follows:
    When the people of the world created the United Nations, they placed various hopes on it. The most important of these was the hope for peace.
    But today, war has disrupted the peaceful lives of people in some countries, and tomorrow it will disrupt the peace of all mankind. If the United Nations fails to live up to the main hope that the people of the world – whether or not their governments are represented in the United Nations – have placed in it, if the United Nations does not give mankind guarantees of security and peace, it is because the United Nations has been influenced by certain forces that disregard the only path to world peace – the path of seeking universal agreement.
    If the United Nations is to live up to the hopes that the people of all countries still place in it, then it must return to the path that the people have pointed out to it since the day it was born, and the first step in this direction is that it must convene a meeting of the five major powers – the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China – as soon as possible to discuss and peacefully resolve existing differences.
    The Second World Peace Congress, which includes representatives from eighty countries and represents the true voice of mankind yearning for peace, calls on the United Nations and the legislative bodies for which the governments of all countries are responsible to immediately consider the following proposals, which aim to restore and maintain peace, and restore and maintain trust between all countries – regardless of their social systems.
    (1) The war currently being waged in Korea has not only brought incalculable disasters to the Korean people, but also threatens to develop into a new world war. In view of this fact, we feel uneasy and demand an immediate end to this war, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and a peaceful resolution of the civil war between the two parts of Korea with the participation of representatives of the Korean people. We demand that this issue be resolved by the Security Council, including all members, including representatives of the People's Republic of China. We call for an end to the interference of the United States military in China's Taiwan, and the war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, both of which harbor the danger of world war.
    (2) We firmly condemn all actions and measures that violate international agreements prohibiting the remilitarization of Germany and Japan. These attempts and measures are a serious threat to the cause of peace. We firmly demand the conclusion of peace treaties with a unified, demilitarized Germany and Japan, and the withdrawal of occupying forces from these two countries.
    (3) We believe that the subjugation and colonial enslavement of some nations by force is a threat to the cause of peace, and we declare that these nations should have the right to freedom and independence. At the same time, we loudly oppose all forms of racial discrimination, because they create hatred between nations and are a threat to peace.
    (4) We believe it is necessary to expose the attempts of aggressors who want to confuse the concept of aggression, using it as an excuse for foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries. We declare that no political, strategic, or economic considerations, and no reasons regarding the internal situation or internal conflicts of a country, can be used as a basis for any country's armed interference in the internal affairs of another country. Regardless of the pretext, the criminal act of a country that first uses military force against another country is aggression.
    (5) We believe that the propaganda of a new war constitutes a serious threat to the peaceful cooperation of all countries and is one of the greatest crimes against humanity.
    We call on the parliaments of all countries to pass laws guaranteeing peace, stipulating that any form of propaganda for a new war should be subject to criminal penalties.
    (6) All upright people, regardless of their political beliefs, believe that the cruel and large-scale extermination of civilians is a crime against all mankind. We demand the appointment of an international authoritative committee to investigate the crimes committed in Korea, especially the issue of General MacArthur's responsibility.
    (7) We are determined to ensure a solid and lasting peace for all mankind, and we hereby submit the following proposals for consideration by the United Nations, the parliaments of all countries, and the people of all countries. These proposals express the vital needs of the people who bear the heavy burden of military budgets.
    Unconditionally prohibit all kinds of atomic weapons, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons and other instruments of mass destruction of mankind; declare the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal.
    The Second World Peace Congress, recognizing its responsibility to the people of all countries, makes a solemn appeal to the major powers and recommends to them that, in the period from 1951 to 1952, all armies – land, air, and sea – be reduced simultaneously, proportionally, and progressively by one-third to one-half.
    This measure will decisively limit the arms race, reduce the danger of aggression, and help alleviate the burden of national military budgets on all strata of the people. It will also promote the restoration of international mutual trust and the necessary cooperation between countries (regardless of their systems).
    The Congress declares that the control of the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and even ordinary weapons, as well as the control of disarmament, is technically feasible.
    A supervised international control body should be established under the Security Council. The responsibilities of this body should include the supervision of disarmament and the supervision of the prohibition of atomic, bacteriological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction.
    To be effective, this control should apply not only to the military, to the existing armaments and armaments production declared by each country, but also, at the request of the International Control Commission, should inspect possible hidden military forces and existing but undeclared armaments and armaments production.
    These recommendations for the reduction of armies are the first stage of universal and complete disarmament, which is the ultimate goal of peace defenders.
    The Second World Peace Congress affirms that the pursuit of a balance of power through the arms race cannot guarantee peace. The Congress firmly believes that the measures it has put forward will not give any party any military advantage, and will undoubtedly avoid war, guarantee security, and improve the welfare of the people of all countries in the world.
    (8) We emphasize that the path of several countries from a peaceful economy to a war economy has increasingly hampered normal international economic relations and the exchange of raw materials and finished products. We believe that this situation has had an adverse impact on the living standards of the people of many countries, hindering economic progress and commercial relations between all countries, and ultimately, this situation is the source of conflicts that endanger world peace. Taking into account the vital interests of all people and willing to improve the situation in the world, we recommend restoring normal trade relations between countries on mutually beneficial terms that meet the needs of the people, eliminating any form of economic discrimination, and ensuring the development of the national economy of all countries and the economic development of large and small countries.
    (9) We believe that destroying cultural relations between the people of all countries will divide them, make them lose mutual understanding, create an atmosphere of suspicion, and promote the propaganda of war. On the other hand, strengthening cultural relations between the people of all countries will create conditions conducive to mutual understanding and strengthen their mutual trust in the struggle for peace. We appeal to the governments of all countries, urging them to devote themselves to improving cultural relations between the people of all countries, so that they can further understand each other's cultural treasures. We recommend that the governments of all countries promote the establishment of international conferences of active figures in the cultural field, promote their mutual visits to each other's countries, and widely disseminate the literary and artistic works of other countries.
    (10) We demand that the United Nations live up to the hopes placed in it by the people of the world, and we ask it to note that we have established a World Peace Council, which is a group that includes representatives of the people of all countries in the world, including representatives of member states and non-member states of the United Nations, as well as representatives of affiliated and colonial countries.
    The World Peace Council urges the United Nations to take practical actions to fulfill its responsibility to strengthen and develop international peaceful cooperation. The World Peace Council shoulders the lofty task of ensuring a solid and lasting peace that is in line with the vital interests of the people of all countries. The World Peace Council will convince all mankind that, despite the difficulties that cannot be underestimated at present, it will surely accomplish its mission.

    二届世界和大致联合国书
    【新华社二十六日讯】第二届世界保卫和平大会致联合国书。全文如下：
    全世界人民在缔造联合国时，曾对它寄予各种希望。其中最重要的一个就是对和平的希望。
    但在今天，战争已扰乱了一些国家的人民的和平生活，而在明日势将扰乱整个人类的和平。如果联合国辜负全世界人民——不论他们的政府在联合国已有代表与否——寄托在它身上的主要希望，如果联合国不给人类以安全与和平的保证，这是因为联合国已受到某些势力的影响，这些势力无视走向全世界和平的唯一的道路——寻求普遍协议的道路。
    如果联合国要不辜负各国人民仍然寄托在它身上的希望，那末它必须回到从它诞生的一天起人民就给它指出的道路上去，而这方向的第一步就是，它必须尽速促成五大国——苏联、美国、法国、英国、中华人民共和国——会议的召开，来讨论与和平解决现存的分歧。
    包括八十个国家的代表，和代表着渴望和平的人类的真正呼声的第二届世界保卫和平大会，要求联合国以及各国政府对之负责的各立法机关，立即考虑下列的建议，这些建议的目的在于恢复与维持和平，恢复与维持一切国家——不论它们的社会制度如何——之间的信任。
    （一）目前在朝鲜进行着的战争，不但给朝鲜人民带来了无法估计的灾难，而且势将发展成为新的世界大战；鉴于这种事实，我们心感不安，我们要求立即结束这场战争，自朝鲜撤退外国军队，并在朝鲜人民代表参加之下，和平解决朝鲜两部分地区之间的内战。我们要求这个问题应由包括中华人民共和国代表在内的，包括全体成员的安全理事会来加以解决。我们呼吁制止美国军队对中国的台湾的干涉，以及对越南民主共和国进行的战争，二者都孕育着世界大战的危险。
    （二）我们坚决斥责一切违反禁止德国和日本重新军事化的国际协定的举动与措施。这些企图与措施都是对和平事业的严重威胁。我们坚决要求与统一的、非军事化的德国和日本缔结和约，并从该两国撤退占领军。
    （三）我们认为用武力使一些民族处于从属的和殖民地奴仆的地位，是对和平事业的威胁，我们宣布这些民族应有自由和独立的权利。同时，我们大声疾呼反对一切形式的种族歧视，因为它们造成民族之间的仇恨，而且是对和平的威胁。
    （四）我们认为必须揭露侵略者的企图，他们想混淆侵略的概念，借以为外国干涉他国内政的口实。我们宣布任何政治、战略和经济上的考虑，任何关于某一国家的内部局势或内部冲突方面的理由，都不能作为任何国家武装干涉另一国家内政的根据。不论借口如何，对另一个国家首先使用军队的国家的这种罪恶行为，就是侵略。
    （五）我们认为新战争的宣传构成了对各国人民和平合作的严重威胁，是对人类最大的罪行之一。
    我们号召世界各国的议会通过保障和平的法律，规定不论以任何形式进行新战争宣传均应受刑事处分。
    （六）一切正直的人们，不问政治信仰如何，都认为残暴无情地大规模灭绝平民的行动是对全人类的罪行。我们要求指派一个国际有权威的委员会调查在朝鲜所犯的罪行，尤其是，调查麦克阿瑟将军的责任问题。
    （七）我们决心为全人类确保稳固而持久的和平，特提出下列建议，请联合国、各国议会和各国人民加以考虑，这些建议表达了承担着沉重的军事预算负担的人民的切身需要。
    无条件禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具；宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会认识到它对各国人民的责任，特向各大国发出庄严的呼吁，并向它们建议在一九五一年到一九五二年期间，在同时，按比例，累进地裁减一切军队——陆军、空军和海军——三分之一到二分之一。
    这种措施将使军备竞赛受到决定性的限制，并将减少侵略的危险，而有助于减轻压在各阶层人民身上的国家军事预算的重担。它还将促进国际互信的恢复，以及各国间（不问它们的制度如何）必要的合作的恢复。
    大会宣告：对禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭人类以至于普通的武器实行管制，以及对裁减军备实行管制，在技术上是可以实现的。
    应在安全理事会之下建立有监督权的国际管制机关。这个机关的职责应包括对裁减军备的监督及实行禁止原子、细菌、化学及其他大规模毁灭性的武器的监督。
    为使其有效起见，这种管制不仅应适用于军队，适用于每一国家所已宣布的现有的军备和军备生产，而且在国际管制委员会的要求之下，并应检查可能暗藏的军队和现有的但未经宣布的军备和军备生产。
    这些裁减军队的建议，是普遍彻底的裁军的第一阶段，这种普遍彻底的裁军就是和平保卫者的终极目标。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会确认以军备竞赛来追求均势，是不能保障和平的。大会坚决认为它所提出的措施，决不会使任何一方在军事上占任何便宜，而且毫无疑问地会避免战争，保障安全，并提高世界各国人民的福利。
    （八）我们强调指出，若干国家从和平经济走上战争经济的道路，已愈来愈使国际间的正常经济关系以及原料和制成品的交换受到妨害。我们认为，这种情况使许多国人民的生活水准受到恶劣的影响，成为经济进步和所有国家间商业关系的障碍，最后，这种情况是危害世界和平的冲突的根源。我们考虑到一切人民的切身利益并愿意改善全世界的情势，特建议在满足人民要求的互利条件下，恢复各国间正常的贸易关系，取消任何形式的经济歧视，确保各国国民经济的发展和大小国家的经济发展。
    （九）我们相信，破坏各国人民间的文化关系，就会使它们分裂，使它们丧失相互间的了解，造成猜疑的空气并助长战争的宣传。在另一方面，加强各国人民间的文化关系，就会造成有利于相互了解的条件并加强它们在争取和平的斗争中的互信。我们向各国政府呼吁，敦促各国政府致力于改善各国人民间的文化关系，使他们能更进一步地认识彼此的文化宝藏。我们建议，各国政府促成文化界积极人士的国际会议的组成，促成他们互相访问对方的国家，及广泛地散播别国的文学艺术作品。
    （十）我们要求联合国不要辜负世界人民所寄托给它的希望，我们请它注意，我们已经设立了一个世界和平理事会，这是一个包括世界各国人民的代表的团体，其中有联合国会员国和非会员国的代表，以及附属和殖民地国家的代表。
    世界和平理事会吁请联合国以实际行动来履行它所负担的加强和发展国际和平合作的职责。世界和平理事会担负着符合各国人民切身利益，确保稳固与持久和平的崇高任务。世界和平理事会将使全人类相信：尽管目前存在着不能过低估计的困难，但它必将完成它的使命。
