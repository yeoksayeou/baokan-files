    Datong Wajinwan Coal Mine Should Promptly Abolish Unreasonable Systems
    To the Editor:
    Are the following things at the Wajinwan Coal Mine in the Datong Mining Area reasonable?
    Workers carry coal from the mine shaft to the outside. The mine uses an old scale to weigh it (over eighty *jin*, approximately equivalent to 100 *jin* on the market scale). However, when the mine sells coal, it does not use this old scale but uses a new scale. We workers have raised this issue many times, but the mine replies, "This is the old rule!"
    When workers carry coal out of the mine shaft, the weight is calculated in units of "zao" and "li" (1 zao = 120 *jin*, 1 li = 12 *jin*). However, if it's 1 zao and 9 *jin* (129 *jin*), they still count it as 1 zao. Only if it's under 10 *jin* (i.e., up to 130 *jin*) do they add 1 li (i.e., 1 zao and 1 li). We have requested changes from the mine many times, but the response is still, "This is the old rule!"
    Editor! This mine shaft has a large slope. After the workers carry coal from the dark bottom of the mine shaft and climb up the steep slope, they are all panting and sweating. Carrying one more *jin* means one more handful of sweat!
    Most of the employees who estimate weight are old personnel. They haven't shed their old thinking much. If a worker knows them (has a good relationship), they estimate a bit more. If they don't know them, and the workers object to the underestimation and request re-weighing, such an old scale, lifting the head three or five *jin* is nothing (for example, 130 *jin* placed on 128 *jin*). The person weighing is especially "skilled" in this. He loosens the scale and quickly puts it down, saying: 128 *jin*, still one "zao". He even adds, "This is the rule." The workers stare helplessly at his smug attitude and tone (this is one example; there are similar things).
    Our mine has ten coal districts. Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are close, while 7, 8, 9, and 10 are very far. If workers carry coal to the distant districts, they can only do half the work of the near districts in a day, but the same wages and grain are paid, which is also unreasonable.
    Editor, is it an "old rule" to use a large scale to buy and a small scale to sell?! Is it also an "old rule" not to give a *li* if it's less than ten *jin*?! Is it also said to be an "old rule" for the weigher to deliberately cheat and deduct from the workers?! We don't understand this so-called "old rule," because that "old rule" was the "rule" of the ruling class exploiting workers in the past. Why does it still exist in today's new society of the people? We cannot express these grievances here. Please publish it in your newspaper to attract the attention of relevant authorities!

    Editor's Note: Based on the situation reflected by Comrade Zhang Dahe, we sent a letter to the Datong Mining Area Party Committee, confirming that the Wajinwan Mine does indeed use an old scale for buying and a market scale for selling, and that unreasonable estimation phenomena exist. Since the liberation of the Datong Mining Area, these unfavorable and unreasonable methods for workers have not been reformed for a long time, causing dissatisfaction among workers. The Party, government, and trade union leaders of the mine area should thoroughly review this. According to a letter from the Datong Mining Area Party Committee, these unreasonable phenomena in the coal mines and the issue of paying near-area wages for carrying coal to distant coal areas have now been improved, which is good. What is the situation after the improvement? What opinions do the vast number of workers have on this? We hope that workers and cadres from the mine area will write to us to let us know.

### 大同挖金湾煤矿应迅速取消不合理制度

    大同挖金湾煤矿应迅速取消不合理制度
    编辑同志：
    大同矿区挖金湾煤矿，有着以下几件事情，你看是否合理呢？
    工人从窑内往外背煤，矿上用老秤收（八十余斤，约合市秤一百斤），可是矿上往外卖煤不使这杆老秤，另用新秤。我们工人提过很多次意见了，但矿上答复说：“这是老规矩了！”
    工人从窑内背出煤来，称秤时以“遭、厘”为单位来计算（每遭一百二十斤，每厘十二斤），但是一遭零九斤（一二九斤）他们也给我们算一遭，要十斤以下（即一三○斤）才按加上一厘算（即一遭一厘）。我们向矿上要求过多少次了，答复的仍是“这是老规矩！”
    编辑同志！这个窑是一个有大坡的窑，工人们从黑沉沉的井底背上煤，爬上大坡出得窑来之后，一个个气喘吁吁，汗流浃背。多背一斤，得多付去一把汗！
    估秤的职工，大部都是旧人员，旧意识去掉的不多，某工人认识他（关系好），他就多估点，不认识他，和估少了不服的工人，要求过秤时，那样的老秤，一抬头三、五斤不算什么（例如一三○斤，放在一二八斤上），称秤的人这一手来的特别的“麻利”，他把秤一松，很快地放下说：一二八斤，还是一“遭”。还得跟上一句，“这是规矩”。他那份得意洋洋的架子和口吻，工人们瞪眼看着没办法（这是一个例子，类似这样事还有）。
    本矿有煤区十个，一、二、三、四、五、六煤区近，七、八、九、十很远，如到远区背煤，一日只能顶近区的半个工，但是工资米却发给一样的，这事也不合理。
    编辑同志，大秤收，小秤卖是“老规矩”？！不够十斤不给一厘，也是“老规矩”！？估秤的人故意捣鬼，克扣工人也说是“老规矩”？！我们对这个所谓“老规矩”有些不明白，因为那个“老规矩”是过去统治阶级剥削工人的“规矩”，而在今天人民的新社会里，为什么还叫它存在呢？我们这些痛苦在这个地方是无法诉说的，请在你们报上发表一下，引起有关机关的注意吧！
            背煤工人  张大合
    编者按：根据张大合工友所反映的情况，我们曾函询中共大同矿区党委会，证实该区挖金湾矿上用老秤收进，市秤售出，以及不合理的估秤现象都是存在的。自大同矿区解放以来，这些对工人不利的、不合理的办法长期未改革，致引起工人的不满，该矿区的党、政及工会领导同志应彻底检讨。据中共大同矿区党委会来信，该区煤矿此种不合理现象，及到远煤区背煤发近煤区的工资问题现已改进，这是好的。改进后的情况如何？广大工人对此有何意见？希望该矿区工人、干部来信告诉我们。
