    How to Be a Radio Announcer
    How to be a radio announcer is a question that is closely linked to the current work of building radio networks in various regions and needs to be resolved. Currently, in North China and Central South China alone, including eleven provinces, eighty-nine special districts, and eight hundred and thirty-seven counties, there are 1,170 trained announcers. Other provinces are also training or actively preparing for training. This is a new group of cultural cadres. They have undergone radio training, and with radios allocated by the organization, they go to work in various counties. However, many of them are unclear about the nature of radio work, how to open up the radio work, and how to do the radio work well. Therefore, I offer the following suggestions for everyone's research.
  An Important Job Position
    Some people, when first assigned by their leaders to work as radio announcers, think that this is just a clerical job involving copying and writing, which is mainly administrative and does not seem to offer much to do. In fact, this is entirely due to a lack of understanding of radio work. What kind of work is radio work? This is a work with great political significance. Through this work, not only can daily domestic and international events be quickly spread throughout the regions, so that policy instructions from governments at all levels can be delivered in a timely manner, but also cadres can be organized to study and improve the political and cultural level of the broad masses of people. If radio networks are established in counties across the country, it means that countless broad bridges have been built between the central government and local governments, between cities and villages, and between leading organs and the broad masses of people. Through these bridges, the connection between our governments at all levels and the broad masses of people will be further strengthened. The work efficiency of our national government agencies will also be improved. Whether all this work can be done well depends critically on whether the work of radio announcers can be launched. We can imagine that the leading organs of general special districts and counties are far from the leadership center, newspapers are delivered slowly, and an instruction or notice often cannot be delivered for ten days or half a month. In this case, listening to the radio actually becomes an important source for lower-level leading organs to obtain news and government orders in a timely manner. In many places, due to the development of radio work, correct news has been spread, enemy rumors have been positively combated, and public opinion has been clarified. Therefore, we can see that radio work is by no means dispensable, nor is it limited to clerical work involving copying and writing, but a very important work. This job position should be said to be a fighting job position. Any view that underestimates radio work is incorrect and wrong. If that radio announcer holds a view that underestimates radio work, the facts will also prove that he will not be able to fulfill the major trust given to him by the people.
  An Excellent Propagandist
    A radio announcer should strive to become an outstanding propagandist in the region. Because he is the first to learn about newly occurring domestic and international events every day, and often comes into contact with some government policies and laws. If he is willing to study hard, he can easily learn from listening to the political trends at home and abroad in each period, the government's important facilities, and even the propaganda points of a certain period. Based on these materials, he should use all possible means to carry out more extensive publicity, and try to spread it through mimeographed newspapers, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, and announcements in front of teams, so that he becomes one of the outstanding propagandists. Announcers in many areas have already demonstrated their talents in this regard. In addition to the several propaganda methods mentioned above, some announcers use the spare time of cadre meetings to introduce current affairs to the cadres. Some announcers place the radio in the hall, clean the house, prepare seats and boiled water, and invite staff from various agencies to listen to the radio. Some conduct discussions after listening to the radio. Many announcers did this during the peace signature campaign, and the effect was very good. Some announcers drew maps based on the war reports they heard for everyone to refer to. Some announcers also mobilized comrades who could draw to use cartoons on wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers, which were very popular. Even more, some announcers, in order to solve the difficulty of cadres and the masses not understanding Mandarin, connected the low-frequency part of the radio to a microphone as an amplifier. After a period of broadcasting, the announcer used the self-made amplifier to explain in the local dialect. The work methods and methods of some announcers mentioned above are very valuable. We can be sure that as long as the announcer is willing to open his mind to find ways, better methods suitable for propaganda and mobilization will emerge one after another.
    In addition, the announcer should promote the benefits of listening to the radio anytime and anywhere. He should use appropriate methods to gradually shift the masses' interest in only listening to operas and songs to listening to news and various lectures or speeches. We cannot blindly cater to the interests and curiosity of some people and only receive entertainment programs; at the same time, we cannot only listen to text programs and not let everyone listen to operas for a few minutes of appropriate rest. However, the announcer should be clear in his mind where we ultimately want to take the audience's interests. When promoting the benefits of listening to the radio, we should focus on using facts to explain and avoid empty and rigid preaching.
  Be Good at Cooperating with Others and Do a Good Job of Listening Work Together
    In order to ensure that the current affairs news and policies and regulations heard can be disseminated in a timely manner and play their due role, in addition to giving the recorded news to the leaders for work reference, the announcer should not stay in his small room all day. He should go out of the radio room and be good at cooperating extensively with other personnel to jointly do a good job of re-publicizing the work of listening to the radio. So who should we cooperate with first? If your county has or is preparing to run a small newspaper or wired broadcasting station (amplifier), then you should first cooperate with them, provide them with manuscripts, discuss propaganda policies with them, and let the things you hear meet the masses through them. Secondly, we should cooperate with everyone who runs wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and rooftop broadcasts. Hold meetings with them, formulate a system for supplying manuscripts, and jointly run the blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts in a county or district. For example, after the Propaganda Department of the Tianmen County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hubei issued a notice to establish blackboard newspapers in various towns and districts, the Chengguan District immediately and automatically organized a news recording team. The announcer compiled the seat numbers in the radio room, and everyone jointly copied them on time; the more distant towns and districts mimeographed the records and sent them once every two days. In terms of solving the difficulty of sending manuscripts, some places cooperate well with the postal staff in the county and district, and they can send the manuscripts to each district and village on time. This is an experience worthy of attention. If our announcer establishes contact with these people through certain leadership relations and organizes them, then our listening work will play a great role.
    The announcer should also establish extensive contact with various agencies, groups, and schools. In particular, he should establish solid ties with activists in these units. Agree with them that as long as there are programs related to them, immediately notify them to listen, and after listening, ask them to give opinions and ask questions. In addition, the social science lectures currently held by the Central Radio Station are relayed by many local people's stations. Cadres at all levels can be mobilized to listen, study with them, and if they don't understand something, they can ask questions for everyone to discuss. If they still don't understand after the discussion, the announcer can tell the radio station and ask them to be responsible for answering. In short, radio work should not and cannot be work confined to the office. It can only be developed if it cooperates closely with various propaganda units and establishes contact with various agencies, groups, and schools. Therefore, being good at cooperating with others should become one of the important working conditions for radio announcers.

    怎样做一个广播收音员
    怎样做一个广播收音员，这是与目前各地建设广播收音网工作分不开而且需要解决的一个问题。目前仅仅华北和中南包括十一个省八十九个专区八百三十七个县，就有经过训练的收音员一千一百七十人。其他各省也都正在训练或者积极筹备训练中。这是一批新的文化干部。他们经过了收音训练，带着组织上配给的收音机到各县去工作，但是他们中间许多人，弄不清收音工作究竟是怎样一种性质的工作，收音工作怎样才能打开局面，怎样才能把收音工作做好等问题，因此，我提出下面一些意见供大家研究。
  一个重要的工作岗位
    有些人在接受领导上分配他做收音员工作之初，以为这不过是一种抄抄写写的文书工作，事务性比较大，似乎没有什么干头儿。其实，这完全是不了解收音工作的缘故。收音工作是怎样的一种工作呢？这是一个带有很大政治意义的工作。通过这一工作，不仅每天的国内外大事可以迅速地传遍各地，使各级政府的政策指示可以及时的下达，并且还可以组织干部学习，提高广大人民群众的政治文化水平。如果全国各县收音网建立了，这就是说中央同地方，城市和乡村，领导机关与广大群众之间架起了无数宽广的桥梁。通过这些桥梁，我们的各级政府同广大群众的联系将进一步增强。我们国家政府机关的工作效率也将为之提高。所有这一切工作是否可以做好，重要的关键就在广播收音员的工作是否可以展开。我们可以设想：一般的专区和县的领导机关远离领导中心，报纸邮递迟缓，一件指示，通知常常十天半月下达不了。在这种情况下，收听广播实际上就成了下级领导机关及时得到新闻政令的重要来源。有许多地方由于收音工作的开展，传布了正确的消息，正面地打击了敌特的谣言，澄清了舆论。因此，我们可以看到，收音工作决不是可有可无的工作，也不是仅限于抄抄写写的文书工作，而是一种极其重要的工作。这个工作岗位应该说是一个战斗的工作岗位。任何轻视收音工作的观点都是不正确的、错误的。如果那位收音员抱着轻视收音工作的观点去工作，事实也将证明他是不会很好完成人民所交给他的重大付托的。
  一个出色的宣传员
    一个广播收音员应该努力使自己成为一个地区的出色的宣传员。因为他每天最先了解新发生的国内外大事，时常接触政府的一些政策法令。如果，他肯用功钻研的话，他就可以很方便的从收听中了解到每一时期国际国内的政治动向，政府的重要设施乃至一定时期的宣传要点。根据这些材料，他应该利用一切可能进行更广泛的宣传，通过油印报、壁报、黑板报、屋顶广播、队前宣布等形式尽量传播，使自己成为出色的宣传员之一。不少地区的收音员已经在这方面表现出了自己的才能。除了上面所说的几项宣传方法之外，有的收音员利用干部集会的空闲，向干部们介绍时事。有的收音员把收音机放置在大厅中，把房子打扫干净，准备了坐位和开水，邀请各机关人员听广播。有的在听完广播之后就进行讨论。许多收音员在进行和平签名运动宣传时就是这样做的，效果很好。有的收音员根据收听的战报，画出了地图供大家参看。有的收音员还动员会画的同志在壁报上、黑板报上用漫画配合，很受欢迎。更有的收音员为了解决干部和群众听不懂北京话的困难，把收音机的低放部分接上麦克风当扩大器用，等广播了一段之后，收音员就通过自造的扩大器用土话加以解说。以上所举一些收音员的工作方法和方式，都是很宝贵的。我们可以确信，只要收音员肯打开脑筋想办法，更好的适合于宣传鼓动的办法便会层出不穷。
    除此以外，收音员还应该随时随地宣传收听广播的好处。应该用适当的方法把群众只爱听唱戏、听歌曲的兴趣，逐渐转移到爱听新闻，爱听各种讲座或演讲。我们不能一味迁就某些人的兴趣和好奇，尽收娱乐节目；同时也不可专门收听文字节目，几分钟适当的休息也不给大家听听戏。但是收音员在思想上应该明确，我们究竟要把听众的兴趣带到什么地方去。在宣传收听广播的好处的时候，应该着重用事实去说明，切忌空洞的生硬的说教。
  善于同别人合作，大家办好收听工作
    为了使收听到的时事新闻，政策法令能够及时地传播出去，发挥它应有的作用，收音员除了应该把收抄的记录新闻交给领导人作工作参考之外，不应该整天守在自己的小屋子里，应该走出收音室，善于广泛地同其他人员合作，大家共同把收听广播的再宣传的工作作好。那么首先应该同那些人合作呢？如果自己的县里办有或者准备办小报或有线广播台（扩大器），那就应该首先同他们合作，供给他们稿件，同他们一块商量宣传方针，通过他们将收听的东西与群众见面。其次应该同一切主办壁报、黑板报、屋顶广播的人们共同合作。同他们一块开会，订定一定的供给稿件的制度，共同办好一个县一个区的黑板报、屋顶广播。举一个例，湖北天门县中共县委会宣传部发出在各镇区建立黑板报的通知以后，城关区立即自动组织了记录新闻小组，收音员在收音室编出座号，大家共同按时抄收；较远的镇、区，把记录油印出来，隔两天派人去送一次。在解决送稿困难方面，有的地方同县区的邮政人员合作的很好，他们可以按时把稿件送到各区各村。这是一个值得重视的经验。我们的收音员如果通过一定的领导关系，同这些人取得了联系，把他们组织起来，那么我们的收听工作将会发挥极大的作用。
    收音员还应该同各机关、各团体、各学校广泛地取得联系。特别应该和这些单位中的积极分子建立巩固的联系。同他们约定好，只要有与他们有关的节目，马上通知他们来听，听了以后，请他们提意见，提问题。此外，中央台现在举办的社会科学讲座，各地人民台很多都转播，可以动员各级干部收听，同他们一同学习，不懂的地方可以提出问题大家讨论，经过讨论还弄不懂，可以由收音员告诉广播电台，请他们负责解答。总之，收音工作不应该也不可能是关在办公室里的工作。它只有和各种宣传单位亲密合作，和各机关团体学校取得联系，工作才能得到开展。因此，善于同别人合作应该成为广播收音员重要的工作条件之一。
