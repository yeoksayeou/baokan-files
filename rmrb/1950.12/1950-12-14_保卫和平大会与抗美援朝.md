	The Peace Conference and Resisting America, Aiding Korea
	By Zhang Bojun, Delegate to the Second World Peace Congress from China
	The Second World Peace Congress was originally scheduled to be held in Sheffield, England, on November 13th. However, forty-eight hours before the opening of the conference, when nearly two thousand representatives from eighty-one countries were en route, the British Labour government used various methods to deny entry to the peace representatives. This reactionary and despicable act, which violated the interests of peace for all mankind, was infuriating. It was regrettable that the peace-loving people of Britain could not make a greater contribution together with the representatives of peace-loving people from all over the world! The British government's obstruction of the Peace Congress demonstrated that the British government did not welcome peace but needed war, exposed the faces of false freedom and false democracy, and further demonstrated that the British government had lost its power of independent autonomy and had become an appendage of American imperialism, forcing peace fighters to make even greater efforts to defend peace and to fight against reactionary forces with stronger unity.
	The conference solemnly and victoriously opened on the evening of November 16th in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. This was the glory of all the Polish people, the glory of the people of Warsaw. The Polish government and the people of Warsaw completed all the arrangements for the conference in the shortest possible time and offered guarantees to ensure the greatest success of the conference, sending the voice of human peace from Poland, from Warsaw. We felt unparalleled pride and joy.
	Here we must point out that during the Second World War, Poland was occupied by the German bandits, the cities were destroyed, the industry was ruined, and even the land was overturned. The whole country suffered a tragic massacre, but the fighting will of the Polish people and the Polish people was not destroyed. After liberation, the power was placed in the hands of the people themselves, and under the leadership of the United Workers' Party, with the enthusiastic help of the Soviet Union, the Polish people showed a high degree of creativity. Various constructions have shifted from recovery to development and are struggling to win a beautiful and peaceful construction for the working people.
	The conference proceeded for seven days in a tense and cordial atmosphere, fully demonstrating the firm will of good people to defend peace and the unity and consolidation of the world peace camp. Representatives from various countries freely and extensively exchanged views on defending peace. After the speeches of one hundred and twenty representatives and the discussions of seven committees, they jointly formulated historically significant resolutions and documents (two declarations and nine resolutions), and formed the World Peace Council, electing two hundred and twenty-two members as members. This proves that under the general task of defending peace, the vast majority of people around the world can unite.
	According to the statistics before the closing of the conference (published in "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!"), there were representatives of the people from eighty-one countries, three hundred and nine guests and observers. Among the representatives and guests, there were four hundred and forty-six women. The professional statistics of the representatives are listed below:
		Politicians				Fifty-nine
		Scientists				Forty-nine
		Writers and Poets			One hundred and sixteen
		Professors				One hundred and twenty-four
		Clergymen				Seventy-two
		International Group Leaders		Thirteen
		National Group Leaders			One hundred and fifty-one
		Filmmakers				Three
		Sculptors				Thirteen
		Composers and Musicians		Seven
		Engineers and Technicians		Seventy-three
		Reporters				Sixty-seven
		Dramatic Actors				Sixty-eight
		Military Personnel			Twelve
		Worker Representatives			Three hundred and forty-one
		Farmer Representatives			Fifty-seven
		Doctors					Sixty-one
		Lawyers					Eighty-three
		Businessmen				Forty-seven
		Students				One hundred and twenty-one
		Government Workers			Two hundred and twenty-two
		City Councilors and Mayors		Twenty
		Teachers				Seventy-two
		Other					Two hundred and thirty-four
	Our Chinese delegation was deeply valued by international friends because we represented the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, representing four hundred and seventy-five million peace-loving people, representing the great anti-aggression force of the East—Resisting America and Aiding Korea. In the conference, we resolutely and solemnly put forward important opinions that were approved by peace-loving people all over the world:
	1.	End the aggression of the United States and other countries against Korea, demand the withdrawal of all foreign aggressor troops from Korea, and achieve a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. This is the central key to the struggle to defend world peace today.
	2.	Demand that the United States immediately stop any interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.
	3.	Demand that MacArthur be declared a war instigator, the main creator of the Far East aggressive war and the main instigator of expanding the Korean War into a world war.
	4.	Resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons and other large-scale weapons that destroy mankind, and demand that the government that first uses atomic weapons be declared a war criminal and be punished.
	5.	Demand that all countries in the world simultaneously reduce armaments, establish effective control, and suggest that the people of all countries cooperate with each other in economic and cultural construction under conditions of peaceful coexistence.
	Defending peace and stopping aggression are two sides of the same coin, which cannot be divided or isolated. We Chinese peace-loving people, under the situation of American imperialist aggression against Korea, are realizing the tasks determined by this peace conference through actual actions to stop aggression. American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea on June 25th this year, and at the same time used the Seventh Fleet to interfere with our liberation of Taiwan. Their air force in Korea invaded our Northeast airspace hundreds of times, killing and injuring our people and damaging our property, and then used a large number of ground forces to press close to our border, deliberately expanding the war of aggression. Mindful of the lessons of history, based on the requirements of human justice, and even more based on our own vital interests, we launched the action of Resisting America and Aiding Korea on a voluntary basis to achieve the purpose of defending our homes and defending our country and maintaining world peace. Only by striking at the aggressors can the aggressors be taught a lesson and not dare to act recklessly. The more enemies we eliminate and the more cities we liberate on the south bank of the Yalu River, the more contribution we make to the cause of peaceful construction.
	The glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the heroic Korean People's Army stand on the front line of defending peace and resisting aggression, receiving the support, respect, and admiration of peace-loving and just people all over the world. We shout to you:
	The Chinese and Korean people unite!
	The people of the world unite!
	Down with American imperialism!
	Long live world peace!

    保卫和平大会与抗美援朝
    出席二届世界和大中国代表  章伯钧
    第二届世界保卫和平大会，原是决定十一月十三日在英国设菲尔德举行的，但是在大会开幕前的四十八小时，当八十一个国家近两千人的代表，已在赴会的途中，英国工党政府竟以种种方法，拒绝和平代表入境，这种违反全人类和平利益的反动卑劣行为，令人愤怒；使爱好和平的英国人民，不能与全世界和平人民的代表共同做出更大的贡献，令人遗憾！英国政府阻挠和平大会的召开，是说明了英国政府不欢迎和平而需要战争，揭穿了伪自由与伪民主的面貌，更说明英国政府已失去独立自主的权力，而做了美帝的附庸，使和平斗士们要以更大的努力来保卫和平，以更坚强的团结来与反动势力作斗争。
    大会是十一月十六日晚在波兰的首都——华沙隆重而胜利地开幕的，这是全波兰人民的光荣，是华沙市人民的光荣。波兰政府和华沙人民，在最短的时间内，完成大会的一切布置，并提出使大会获得最大成功的保证，把人类的和平呼声，从波兰发出，从华沙发出，真是感到无比的骄傲和愉快。
    这里我们必须指出，在第二次大战中，波兰曾被德寇占领了，城市被破坏了，工业被摧毁了，连土地也被翻过来了，整个国家惨遭掠杀，但是波兰人民和波兰人民的战斗意志，不曾为所毁灭，解放以后，把政权掌握在人民自己的手里，在统一工人党领导之下，在苏联的热情帮助之下，波兰人民表现着高度的创造力，各项建设已经是由恢复而趋向发展，正为争取劳动人民美好的和平建设而斗争。
    大会在紧张而亲热的空气中，进行了七天，充分表现出善良人民保卫和平的坚决意志及世界和平阵营的团结与巩固，各国代表们都自由而广泛地交换了关于保卫和平的意见，经过一百二十位代表的发言，和七个委员会的讨论，共同制订了有历史意义的决议和文献（两项宣言和九项决议），并组成了世界保卫和平委员会，选举了二百二十二人为委员，这证明在保卫和平的总任务下，全世界最大多数的人民是可以团结起来的。
    在这次大会中，根据闭幕前的统计（载“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”），计有八十一个国家的人民代表，三○九个来宾和观察者。代表和来宾中共有妇女四四六人，代表的职业统计，列表说明如下：

              其他                      二三四
    我们中国代表团，深得国际朋友们的重视，因为我们是代表毛主席领导下的新中国，是代表四万万七千五百万爱好和平的人民，是代表东方伟大的反侵略力量——抗美援朝；在会议中，我们坚决而庄严地提出为全世界和平人民所赞同的重要意见：
    一、结束美国和其他国家对朝鲜的侵略，要求从朝鲜撤退一切外国侵略军，实现朝鲜问题的和平解决。这是今天保卫世界和平的斗争的中心关键。
    二、要求美国立即停止对于中国人民解放台湾的任何干涉。
    三、要求宣布麦克阿瑟是战争挑拨者，他是远东侵略战争的主要制造者和将朝鲜战争扩大为世界战争的主要煽动者。
    四、坚决反对原子武器及其他各种大规模毁灭人类的武器的使用，并要求宣布首先使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯而加以制裁。
    五、要求世界各国同时裁减军备，建立有效的管制，并建议各国人民在和平共存的条件下作经济文化建设上的相互协助。
    保卫和平与制止侵略是一个问题的两面，不能分割，亦不能孤立，我们中国爱好和平的人民，在美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的形势之下，是以实际的制止侵略行动来实现这次和平大会所决定的任务的。美帝国主义者，在今年六月二十五日发动侵朝战争，同时以第七舰队干涉我解放台湾，其侵朝空军成百次的侵犯我东北领空，杀伤我国人民，毁损我国财产，复以大量陆军进逼我国边境，蓄意扩大侵略战争，我们懔于历史的教训，基于人类正义的要求，更基于切身的利害关系，在志愿的基础上展开抗美援朝的行动，以达到保家卫国，维护世界和平的目的，只有在打击侵略者的行动中，才能使侵略者接受教训而不敢乱作乱为；我们在鸭绿江南面多消灭一个敌人，多解放一个城市，也就是对和平建设事业多一分的贡献。
    光荣的中国人民志愿军，和英勇的朝鲜人民军，站在捍卫和平抵抗侵略的最前线，受着全世界爱好和平正义的人类的支援、崇敬和瞻仰。向你们高呼：
    中朝人民团结起来！
    全世界人民团结起来！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    世界和平万岁！
