Summary of Armyworm Prevention and Control Work in 1950

(I) Occurrence Situation:

Armyworms have historically occurred in the North China and Northeast regions, becoming a major pest of wheat and coarse grains. This year, due to abundant rainfall and warm weather, the occurrence was quite widespread. According to reports from various locations, it began in mid-April, occurring in wheat fields both north and south of the Yangtze River: Mengcheng and Huaiyuan in northern Anhui; Dangtu and Wuhu in southern Anhui; Changhua in Zhejiang; Danyang in southern Jiangsu; suburbs of Nanjing; and various counties in northern Jiangsu. In Shandong, Huimin, Tancheng, Lijing, Lincheng, and Bin County also damaged coarse grains. By late June, the occurrence was widespread in North China, Northeast China, and Henan Province, with the Northeast being the most severely affected. According to reports from agricultural experiment stations in Gongzhuling and Hulan, adult activity was first observed in large numbers from late April to mid-May, with numbers being more than eight times higher than last year. By early July, larvae damage had spread to over one hundred counties and cities in six provinces, covering an area of approximately 4.3 million mu, accounting for more than 80% of the total affected area nationwide.

According to incomplete data from various locations, the occurrence situation is roughly as follows:

| Region  | Affected Provinces                | Prevention Area (mu) | Damage and Prevention Situation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

(II) Prevention and Control Situation:

Because armyworms are an important pest that occurs every year, governments at all levels have attached great importance to prevention and control. The Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry has issued two emergency circulars, printed leaflets and booklets. Many provinces and counties have sent large numbers of cadres to go deep into the countryside to help promote this work. A mass insect eradication movement was immediately launched in various places.

At the beginning of the insect infestation, many places arranged specific prevention work. Heilongjiang Province carried out stubble removal, weed cutting, and centralized burning during spring plowing, and established prevention committees and reconnaissance groups, which achieved practical results. The affected area this year was reduced by half compared to last year, and the degree of damage was also much lighter than last year. In Shen County, Hebei, 109 villages thoroughly carried out egg collection during the adult egg-laying period, mobilizing more than 8,000 people every day during the most intense period. As a result, there were very few insect infestations.

During the capture period, party and government agencies in many areas promptly convened meetings and used various forms to carry out publicity and mobilization. For example, Jiutai County, Jilin, held a general meeting of all cadres; the suburbs of Changchun City held a district chief meeting; and Jiaohe County made full preparations for insect control work after planting was completed. At the County People's Congress, insect control work was made an item in the resolution. The 16 districts of the county generally organized insect prevention committees at the village level.

In the insect eradication movement in Yongji County, more than 40,000 cadres at all levels and other personnel were organized to participate in the insect capture committees in various districts and villages, and communication and publicity work was strengthened. The Huapi Factory District Elementary School also rehearsed skits to eliminate the superstitious ideas of the masses and promoted the participation of 150,000 people in the county in insect control, saving 600,000 mu of crops from serious losses. After seeing the practical effect of insect capture, the farmers all said, "No insect can resist capture!" Eight villages in the suburbs of Changchun City reported capturing 264 buckets of insects, generally three to five times.

The mobilization in the insect control movement in the Northeast region this year was quite extensive. All levels of government agencies and mass organizations actively participated. Some villages in Shuanghe Township, Yongji County, concentrated their efforts on a blitz, and clerks in shops and restaurants were also involved in insect eradication. The first district of Shulan had women's insect capture teams organized by women's organizations, taking the lead in capturing insects. Many of the grassroots organizations of the prevention committee relied on mutual aid groups and the Party and League, such as Qi Wenzhi, a provincial model worker in Yongji County, mobilized his mutual aid group to establish a prevention committee, and there was a inspection team every day to inspect insect capture work.

According to incomplete statistics, the prevention area in various parts of the country this year reached approximately 5 million mu, and nearly 300,000 people were mobilized.

In addition, some areas had insufficient organization, cadre paralysis, and mass superstition, resulting in serious losses. According to statistics from the Northeast alone, more than 16,000 mu of leaves were eaten. Suiyuan suffered considerable losses because of insufficient prior preparation, even though the centrally allocated wettable DDT was used for spraying.

(III) Several Issues:

1.  In the future large-scale insect control movement, we must earnestly implement the basic principle of prevention over cure. Facts have proven that practical results have been achieved in places where preparations, plans, and specific arrangements have been made and implemented in advance. Spring plowing and weeding and egg collection are particularly noteworthy issues.

2.  Appropriate model evaluation and reward campaigns should be used to encourage the insect control enthusiasm of the masses. For example, this year, Liaoxi Province allocated 500,000 jin of grain as a reward for insect eradication. In the ten districts of Heishan County, those with serious insect disasters used the reward grain to buy stationery for students and towels and socks for women, increasing everyone's enthusiasm for insect capture. When insect eradication was intense, 50,000 people participated every day, and more than 150,000 mu of insect pests were controlled in a very short period of time.

3.  In the future, attention should be paid to exchanging and improving insect control technology. For example, the insect capture movement in various parts of the Northeast is still stuck in the stage of hand-pinching and foot-stomping, but in some individual places, the use of tools for insect capture has been created, which obviously improves the efficiency of insect eradication. For example, Zhang Hehou, a party member in Hujiadian Village, Jingyue District, Changchun City, used sieves and wooden boards to capture insects, saving ten workdays per hectare compared to using shoe soles to capture and beat them.

Note: Armyworm is commonly known as rice armyworm or *zi fang*. In the Northeast, it is called night-stealing worm.

    一九五○年行军虫防治工作总结
     （一）发生情况：
    行军虫历年来发生于华北东北一带，成为小麦杂粮的重要害虫。今年由于雨水较多，气候温暖，发生相当普遍，综合各地报告，自四月中旬起即开始在大江南北：皖北蒙城、怀远、皖南当涂、芜湖；浙江昌化；苏南丹阳；南京市郊以及苏北各县麦田发生；在山东，惠民、郯城、利津、临城、滨县等地则兼害杂谷。至六月下旬，华北、东北、及河南等省均普遍发生，其中以东北被害最重。据公主岭和呼兰两地农业试验场的报告，自四月下旬至五月中旬开始大量发现成虫活动，其数量较去年多至八倍以上，至七月上旬幼虫为害已遍及六个省份一百数十县市，面积约达四百三十余万亩，占全国发生面积的百分之八十以上。
     根据各地不完全资料，发生情况略如下表：地区  发生省份                防治面积          为害及防治情况东北  吉林、黑龙江、     ４、３５３、８５７亩   为害谷子高粱玉米等，
      辽东、辽西热河、                          个别地方被吃光，
                                                不完全统计，
      松江、沈阳市、旅大                        动员二十二万余人华北  河北、平原、山西、绥远 ２７１、６１２亩   以谷子为主，
      察哈尔                     绥远则兼有小麦、黍、豌
                                                豆等，被害面积在６０％
                                                以上（无统计）华东  山东、苏北、皖北、皖南 ４０１、４７９亩   为害麦叶穗子及高粱等，
      苏南、浙江、福建                 不完全统计捉虫１８、０００
                                           余斤，动员６０、０００人以中南  河南                                      上为害杂粮作物，严重者被害
                                                率达９５％一般约２０％西北  陕西、甘肃                     ８３０亩   为害杂粮作物内蒙  二旗、一县               ３１、１１０亩   为害杂粮作物合计                     ５、０５８、９０８亩   动员人数二十九万二千余人
        （二）防治情况：
    由于行军虫是历年发生的重要害虫，所以各级政府都很重视防治，东北农林部曾两次发出紧急通报，印发传单，小册子，很多省县则派出大批干部，深入农村、帮助推动这一工作，各地当即掀起了群众性的除虫运动。
    当虫害发生之初，不少地方布置了具体的预防工作，黑龙江省在春耕中进行了搂茬子、割杂草，集中烧毁，并成立了防委会、侦察组，收到了实际效果，按今年发生面积较去年减少一倍，被害程度也远较去年为轻；河北深县则有一百零九村于成虫产卵期间，彻底进行了采卵工作，在最紧张时，每天动员到八千人以上，因此虫害发生很少。
    捕打期间，不少地区的党政机关即时召开会议，通过各种形式进行宣传动员，如吉林九台县召开了全体干部大会；长春市郊召开了区长会议，蛟河县则于种完地后，对治虫工作做了充分准备工作，在县人民代表会议上，把治虫工作做为决议中的一项。全县十六个区普遍以屯为单位，组织防虫委员会。
    永吉县在灭虫运动中，组织各级负责干部及其他人员四万余人，到各区村参加捕虫委员会，并加强通讯宣传工作，桦皮厂区完小并排演短剧，消除群众的迷信思想，推动了全县十五万人参加治虫，使六十万亩的庄稼免受严重损失，农民见到捉虫的实际效果后，都说“什么虫也抵抗不住捉呀！”长春市郊区八个村统计捉虫达二百六十四桶，一般都捉三次到五次。
    东北区在今年的治虫运动中，动员面是相当广泛的，各地机关、群众团体无不积极参加，永吉县双河镇区部分村屯集中力量突击，商店、饭馆的店员都卷入灭虫，舒兰一区则有妇女组织的妇女捕虫队，带头捉虫。防委会的基层组织中很多是依靠了互助组和党团，如永吉县省模范齐文志动员他的互助组成立防委会，每天都有检查队检查捕虫工作。
    据不完全统计，今年全国各地防治面积约达五百万亩，动员群众近三十万人。
    此外也有些地区，组织不够严密，干部麻痹，群众迷信致造成严重的损失。仅东北统计，被吃光叶子的即有一万六千余亩，绥远则因事前准备不够，虽有中央临时拨往的可湿性ＤＤＴ帮助喷射，但遭到的损失仍是相当严重的。
    （三）几个问题：
    １、在今后的广大治虫运动中，我们必须认真执行防重于治的基本方针，事实证明，凡能事前有准备有计划并具体布置贯彻执行的地方，均已收到实际效果，如春耕除草和采卵，就是特别值得注意的问题。
    ２、应适当的通过评模奖励运动，以鼓励群众的治虫情绪，如今年辽西省拨出灭虫奖励粮五十万斤，黑山县十个区，虫灾严重的，以奖励粮买文具奖给学生及手巾袜子奖给妇女，提高大家的捉虫情绪，除虫紧张时，每天有五万人参加，很短时期内即防治了十五万亩以上的虫害。
    ３、今后应注意交流并提高治虫技术，如东北各地在捕虫运动中，还是停留在手捏脚踩的阶段，但在个别地方已创造了使用工具捕虫，显然提高了除虫的效率，如长春市郊净月区胡家店村党员张合厚，捕虫利用了簸箕和木板，每垧地要比用鞋底去捕打节省十个工。
    注：行军虫俗名黏虫或虸蚄。东北称为夜盗虫
