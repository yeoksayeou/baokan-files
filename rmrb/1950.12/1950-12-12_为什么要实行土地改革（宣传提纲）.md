Why must land reform be carried out, and what is the basic purpose of land reform?

	1. The original land system in China was extremely unreasonable.

	The land situation in old China - The land system in old China was a feudal land system. This feudal land system was extremely unreasonable. Landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for 10% of the rural population, occupied 70% to 80% of the land; poor peasants, farmhands, middle peasants, and other working people, who accounted for 90% of the rural population, owned only 20% to 30% of the land.

	After the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, land reform was implemented in areas with 145 million agricultural population, eliminating feudal exploitation and achieving "land to the tiller." However, there are still vast areas where land reform has not been implemented, and feudal exploitation relations are still maintained. In those areas where land reform has not been implemented, in some places, such as some areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, land is slightly more dispersed, with landlords occupying 30% to 50% of the land, and rich peasants occupying 10% to 15% of the land; while in other places, such as Sichuan and other areas, land is even more concentrated, with landlords alone occupying 70% to 80% of the land.

	In rural areas where land reform has not been carried out, the vast majority of peasants have to rent land from landlords at high rents. Rent generally accounts for 50% of the land's produce, and in places with high rents, almost all of the land's produce has to be paid to the landlord.

	Landlords also impose various additional forms of exploitation on peasants, such as "offering new crops," "presenting gifts," using large measures to collect rent, and unpaid labor.

	In many places, peasants renting land from landlords also have to pay a deposit, which is at least equal to one year's harvest from the land, and often amounts to a quarter of the land's value. Most peasants are unable to pay the deposit and often borrow money and grain from the landlords at high interest rates, and then pay it to the landlords in the form of a deposit. After the deposit reaches the landlords, it becomes the landlord's capital for lending at high interest, which is used to exploit the peasants again.

	The interest rates on usurious loans are unimaginably high. In the past, when the currency value was stable, "3% interest per month for money" and "5% interest per month for grain" were the most common interest rates for rural loans. Higher rates included so-called "adding one big measure," "doubling every collection," and "rolling donkey." Usury is one of the important means by which landlords annex peasants' land.

	Heavy rent and high interest are the two nooses that strangle peasants. Under this cruel squeeze, peasants "endure the hardship of cattle and horses and eat the food of pigs and dogs" (as the peasants themselves say). They work all year round without getting enough to eat, while landlords get something for nothing and live a life of luxury.

	Based on such an unreasonable land system, the feudal rule of the landlord class in rural areas stands firm. Landlords can act arbitrarily and oppress peasants at will. During the reactionary rule, evil landlords colluded with the government to exploit peasants, rape peasants' wives and daughters, seize peasants' land, set up private courts, and kill people, committing all kinds of evil. This is the tragic situation the peasants in old China were in.

	2. If China's old land system is not changed, the development of agricultural production will be seriously hindered.

	Peasants in this tragic situation have very low production enthusiasm. They cannot get enough to eat and keep warm, so naturally they have no ability to expand reproduction and improve production technology. Since peasants usually live in extreme poverty, they are naturally unable to resist natural disasters. Whenever there is a disaster, large numbers of rural people flee or starve to death in ditches, resulting in wasteland and great damage to production.

	3. If China's old land system is not changed, industry will not be able to develop smoothly either.

	The prerequisites for industrial development are capital, raw materials, labor, and sales markets, all of which must be provided in large quantities by the development of agricultural production, which can only develop on a rational land system.

	Before the extremely unreasonable land system is reformed, the level of rural productivity is very low, and the country's grain is only enough for self-sufficiency. Of course, it is impossible to plant cash crops on a large scale to meet the raw material needs of certain industries.

	At the same time, before the extremely unreasonable land system is reformed, the vast majority of peasants live in extreme poverty, with their income insufficient to feed themselves, and their purchasing power is extremely low. Since this market with a consumer population of 400 million is shrinking, it cannot provide a broad sales outlet for industrial development.

	Without raw materials and markets, light industry cannot develop in the first place. Without the development of agriculture and light industry, it is impossible to accumulate capital to develop heavy industry and realize our country's industrialization. Without the development of industry, it is impossible to supply agriculture with machinery, realize the mechanization of agriculture, fundamentally liberate rural productive forces, and leapfrog the level of agricultural production.

	Without industrialization and agricultural mechanization, and without a leap in the development of productive forces, the poverty problem of our people cannot be fundamentally solved.

	4. If China's old land system is not changed, the peasants cannot be liberated, and a strong people's armed forces cannot be established, because the people's armed forces are basically composed of peasants in terms of their composition. Moreover, under the old land system, since it is impossible to form a modern industrial base, it is impossible to establish modern armies, navies, and air forces. Therefore, implementing land reform is a prerequisite for strengthening national defense.

	5. If China's old land system is not changed, the democratization of our country cannot be thoroughly realized. Because if 80% of the country's population, the peasants, are still groaning under feudal rule and cannot truly become the masters of the country, the so-called national democratization has no foundation.

	6. If China's old land system is not changed, it is impossible to change the culturally backward state of our nation, making cultural movements such as "eliminating illiteracy," "popularizing education," "mass literature and art," and "national health" empty talk without a foundation.

	Because the landlord class does not allow peasants to enjoy the right to cultural education, and when peasants are still living in extreme poverty and darkness, they have no energy to learn culture and receive education. It is impossible to carry out a truly broad cultural and educational movement.

	Therefore, this extremely unreasonable feudal land system is the root cause of our nation's invasion, oppression, poverty, and backwardness, and it is the basic obstacle to our country's democratization, industrialization, independence, unity, and prosperity. It is necessary to implement land reform to change this unreasonable land system—abolish the feudal land ownership of the landlord class and implement peasant land ownership. The purpose of land reform is to "liberate rural productive forces, develop agricultural production, and pave the way for the industrialization of New China" (Article 1 of the Land Reform Law).

II. Implementing land reform is beneficial to the people of the whole country.

	1. Implementing land reform can thoroughly destroy the foundation of counter-revolutionary forces and consolidate the victory of the people's revolution.

	At present, the People's Liberation War has basically ended on the mainland. The ruling forces of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been destroyed, and the Chinese people have achieved basic victory. However, if we do not further abolish feudal land ownership and eliminate feudal forces, the victory of the people's revolution will not be consolidated. Because the feudal land system and the feudal forces formed on the basis of this system are the roots of the Chinese reactionaries and the pillars of imperialism in China. If the feudal land system is not abolished and the feudal forces are not eliminated, imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries will collude with the feudal forces to carry out various counter-revolutionary conspiracies, even armed rebellions. Therefore, we must implement land reform to eliminate feudalism.

	2. Implementing land reform will enable the people to obtain the basic fruits of revolutionary victory, and the worker-peasant alliance and the political unity of the people of the whole country can be consolidated. In the past 20 years of revolutionary struggle, the peasants have contributed the most, shouldered the heaviest burdens, and provided soldiers, grain, and laborers. Now that the whole country has won victory, if the long-awaited land issue of the peasants is not resolved, if the peasants cannot grasp political power in the countryside, and if the peasants do not get the fruits of revolutionary victory, the peasants will definitely be very disappointed, and the political enthusiasm of the peasants will not be able to be brought into play. During the People's Liberation War, land reform was implemented in areas with about 145 million agricultural population, mobilizing the peasant masses and supporting the People's Liberation Army to defeat the joint offensive of the US-Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and winning a great nationwide victory. In the next three years or so, land reform will be implemented in areas with about 264 million agricultural population, thoroughly eliminating feudal forces, completing the historical task of the Chinese people's democratic revolution against feudalism, and enabling the country's approximately 400 million peasants to obtain land and achieve liberation politically and economically. This will make the worker-peasant alliance incomparably consolidated, becoming an invincible force; therefore, it will also make the political unity of the people of the whole country, based on the worker-peasant alliance, more consolidated, the people's democratic dictatorship of the new-democratic regime more consolidated, and the democratization of the country can be truly realized.

	3. Land reform liberates peasants from feudal exploitation and feudal oppression. Free peasants cultivate on free land, and their production enthusiasm will surely soar unprecedentedly. Agricultural production will increase significantly, and the lives of peasants will also improve significantly. For example, in areas where land reform has been implemented, this year's agricultural production in Northeast China will increase from more than 13 million tons in 1949 to 18 million tons; Shanxi Province is expected to increase 250,000 head of draught animals this year; each peasant in Jilin Province has a surplus of 250 jin of grain, and each person in Shexian County, Hebei Province has a surplus of 1.5 shi of grain. According to some surveys in Hebei, Shanxi, and Chahar, middle peasants account for 80% of the peasant population, which means that most of the poor peasants before land reform have now risen to become middle peasants.

	4. Precisely because agricultural production has increased after land reform, it is possible to gradually increase the planting of cash crops and solve the raw material needs of certain industries; also precisely because the lives of peasants have gradually improved after land reform, their purchasing power has increased, thereby creating a broad domestic market for the development of industry and paving the way for the country's industrialization. In Northeast China after land reform, the total value of peasants' purchasing power this year is expected to be equivalent to about 5.66 million tons of grain, and the sales of industrial products have increased much more than in the past. For example, the annual sales volume of cloth in the entire Northeast region was 800,000 bolts in 1947, 1.2 million bolts in 1948, 3.2 million bolts in 1949, and will be 9 million bolts in 1950. This year, the total value of industrial production in the entire Northeast region is expected to increase by nearly 100% compared to last year, that is, equivalent to 193% of last year, and its proportion in the total value of industry and agriculture will increase from 35% last year to 43%.

	5. Land reform has removed obstacles to industrial development. As industry develops, the material life of workers can also be improved, and the living standards of the people of the whole country will also improve accordingly.

	6. With the development of both industry and agriculture, commerce will inevitably develop accordingly, which is beneficial to industrialists and businessmen.

	7. Land reform has improved the material life of peasants, thereby creating a prerequisite for carrying out a truly national new cultural movement, enabling educators, literary and artistic workers, and health workers to obtain conditions for carrying out extensive work in the vast rural areas.

	8. The liberation of women is inseparable from the liberation of the entire people. Without eliminating feudalism, women cannot be liberated; land reform is a decisive step in enabling the vast rural women to move towards liberation.

	9. Land reform is a decisive step in uniting, organizing, and improving the ideology and politics of the vast rural youth.

III. Land reform eliminates the landlord class; however, individual landlords still have a way out after land reform, and landlords should honestly abide by the people's government's laws and decrees on land reform.

	1. The task of land reform is to eliminate the landlord class, which is absolutely necessary and cannot be shaken in the slightest. However, eliminating the landlord class does not mean physically eliminating landlords. The Central People's Government's Land Reform Law stipulates that landlords should be allocated a share of land and means of production to give landlords a way to make a living; the people's government also stipulates that as long as landlords completely abide by government laws and decrees after land reform, strive to engage in labor production or other management, and have no reactionary behavior for more than five consecutive years, their class status can be changed, and it can be determined as laborer class status or other class status according to the nature of their labor or management. After land reform, landlords are not allowed to live a parasitic life without labor, but they can rely on labor production or other business to live. Some of them have agricultural technology and can engage in agricultural production; some of them have cultural knowledge and can use their cultural knowledge to engage in mental labor. In addition, land reform does not infringe upon the industry and commerce run by landlords, except for confiscating landlords' land, draught animals, farm tools, surplus grain, and surplus houses in rural areas in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the Land Reform Law, other properties of landlords are not confiscated, so landlords can also use those uncon confiscated assets to operate industry and commerce or other businesses.

	2. If landlords are stubborn and try every means to resist and sabotage land reform, such as destroying draught animals, farm tools, and other properties, disuniting peasants, or even colluding with US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and bandits to carry out anti-people and counter-revolutionary conspiracies, or even armed rebellion, the people's government will of course resolutely suppress them and impose the corresponding criminal punishments according to the severity of their circumstances - from imprisonment to the death penalty. The era of reactionary rule is gone forever, the power of the people is invincible, and the people's regime cannot be overthrown. Stubborn landlords who want to sabotage land reform are just playing with fire and digging their own graves, and there is no way out.

	3. Some industrialists and businessmen or people of other class status who are also landlords, as long as they hand over the land property that should be confiscated or requisitioned according to law, their industry and commerce and their land property directly used for other occupations will be protected and will not be touched. Moreover, after land reform is completed, they will be treated the same as people of other class status. That is to say, they have also shed the inglorious title of "also landlord."

	As for rich peasants of the semi-landlord type with a large amount of rented land (including rich peasants with a small amount of rented land in certain special areas), when their rented land is requisitioned, their self-cultivated and hired portions will be guaranteed, and they can be more at ease in production.

IV. How should everyone support land reform?

	1. Land reform is beneficial to the people of the whole country and must be carried out. No one can hinder it. Land reform is a "test" for all people and all parties in China during the historical period of new democracy, and it is a touchstone for distinguishing revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries and complete revolutionaries from verbal revolutionaries. All revolutionary people and democratic parties should be able to withstand this test and actively help land reform. Enlightened elements of the landlord class should recognize the general trend and must not hinder the just demands of peasants to distribute landlord land.

	2. In areas where land reform is about to be implemented, everyone should study the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China and Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's report on the land reform issue, and use every opportunity to conduct extensive propaganda to others. If your family belongs to the landlord class, or if your relatives and friends belong to the landlord class, you should first advise them to honestly abide by the laws and decrees of the people's government, bow their heads to the peasant masses, hand over land property according to law, and warn them not to resist and sabotage.

	3. Before the start of land reform, especially after the start, a part of the landlord class will inevitably use various faces to spread rumors, slander, and clamor to oppose land reform. We must be vigilant against this and not be fooled and become the echo of the landlord class. Instead, we must stand firm, refute the rumors and slander of the landlord class, and solemnly safeguard the government's laws and decrees and the interests of the peasants.

	4. Of course, in such a great revolutionary movement of land reform involving tens of millions of people, it is inevitable that there will be some shortcomings and deviations. We should offer well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions for improvement on these shortcomings and deviations, and we should not unilaterally exaggerate or distort the facts, so as not to be exploited by the landlord class.

### 为什么要实行土地改革（宣传提纲）

    为什么要实行土地改革（宣传提纲）
    一  为什么必须进行土地改革，土地改革的基本目的是什么？
    １、中国原来的土地制度极不合理。
    旧中国的土地情况——旧中国的土地制度，是封建的土地制度。这种封建的土地制度极不合理。占农村人口百分之十的地主和富农，占有百分之七十到八十的土地；占乡村人口百分之九十的贫、雇、中农及其他劳动人民，总共只占有百分之二十到三十的土地。
    经过抗日战争和人民解放战争，已有一万四千五百万农业人口的地区实行了土地改革，消灭了封建剥削，做到了耕者有其田。但还有广大地区尚未实行土地改革，仍然维持着封建的剥削关系。在那些尚未实行土地改革的地区内，有一些地方，如长江中下游的某些地区，土地略有分散，地主占有百分之三十到五十的土地，富农占有百分之十到十五的土地；而在另一些地方，如四川及其他一些地区，土地则更形集中，仅地主即占有百分之七十到八十的土地。
    在未经土地改革的农村，广大农民不得不以高租租入地主的土地。地租一般占土地产物的百分之五十，地租高的地方，土地产物几乎全部要缴给地主。
    地主对农民还有各种各样的额外剥削，“献新”、“送礼”、大斗收租、无偿劳动等等。
    许多地方农民租种地主土地还要缴付押金，押金至少等于其土地一年的收获量，一般常达地价的四分之一。农民多数是无力缴出押金的，往往是以高利从地主手里借来钱谷，再以押金形式缴付地主；押金到了地主手里以后，则又成为地主放高利贷的资本，又用以盘剥农民。
    高利贷的利息之高是难以想像的。在过去币值稳定的时期，“钱三分”、“谷五分”是农村借贷最普通的利息。高者有所谓“大加一”、“集集翻”、“驴打滚”等。高利贷是地主兼并农民土地的重要手段之一。
    重租高利是地主绞杀农民的两根绞索。农民在这种残酷绞榨之下，“受的牛马苦，吃的猪狗食”（农民自己的谚语），终年劳动，不得一饱，而地主则不劳而获，过着奢侈的生活。
    在如此不合理的土地制度的基础上，竖立着地主阶级在农村中的封建统治。地主可以作威作福，任意欺压农民。恶霸地主在反动统治时期，勾结官府，鱼肉农民，奸淫农民妻女，霸占农民田产，私设公堂，杀害人命，无恶不作。这就是旧中国的农民所处的悲惨的境遇。
    ２、中国的旧土地制度如果不加改变，农业生产的发展就受到严重的阻碍。
    处在这种悲惨境遇下的农民，生产情绪是十分低落的。他们求温饱而不可得，自然根本无力去扩大再生产和改进生产技术。而农民平时既过着极其贫困的生活，自然更没有可能来抵御灾荒。每遇灾歉，成批的农村人口向外逃亡，或饿死沟壑，以致田地荒芜，生产遭受很大的破坏。
    ３、中国的旧土地制度如果不加改变，工业也是不可能顺利地发展的。
    工业发展的前提是资金、原料、劳动力和销售市场，这些都必须农业生产发展了才能大量地提供出来，而农业生产却只有在合理的土地制度上才能发展。
    在极不合理的土地制度未加改革以前，农村生产力的水平很低，全国粮食仅可自给，当然就不可能大规模地种植经济作物，满足某些工业发展的原料之需要。
    同时，在极不合理的土地制度未加改革以前，广大农民的生活极其贫苦，所得不够糊口，购买力极低。这个拥有四万万消费人口的市场既然萎缩，就不能给工业发展提供广阔的销路。
    缺乏原料和市场，首先轻工业就无法发展起来。农业和轻工业不发展，就不可能积累资金，以便发展重工业，实现我们国家的工业化。而工业不发展，就不可能供给农业以机器，实现农业的机械化，从根本上解放农村生产力，把农业生产水平飞跃地提高。
    没有工业化与农业的机械化，没有生产力的飞跃发展，我国人民的贫困问题也就不能根本解决。
    ４、中国的旧土地制度如果不加改变，农民就不能解放，就不能建立强大的人民武力，因为人民武力按其成分来说基本上必然是农民所组成的。而且，在旧土地制度下既然不可能形成现代化的工业基础，就不能建立现代化的陆军、海军和空军。所以，实行土地改革，又是增强国防力量的前提条件。
    ５、中国的旧土地制度如果不加改变，我们国家的民主化也是不可能彻底实现的。因为如果占全国人口百分之八十的农民还呻吟在封建统治之下，不能真正成为国家的主人，所谓国家民主化就是没有基础的。
    ６、中国的旧土地制度如果不加改变，也就不可能改变我们民族的文化落后的状态，使“扫除文盲”、“普及教育”、“大众文艺”、“国民卫生”等文化运动成为没有基础的空谈。
    因为地主阶级是不让农民有享受文化教育的权利的，而当农民还在过着极端贫困和黑暗的生活时，也没有心力来学文化，受教育，要开展真正广大的文化教育运动成为不可能的事。
    所以，这种极不合理的封建的土地制度是我们民族被侵略，被压迫，穷困及落后的根源，是我们国家民主化、工业化、独立、统一及富强的基本障碍。必须实行土地改革，改变这种不合理的土地制度——废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，实行农民的土地所有制。土地改革的目的就是为了“解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，为新中国的工业化开辟道路”（《土地改革法》第一条）。
    二  实行土地改革，对全国人民有利。
    １、实行土地改革才能彻底摧毁反革命力量的基础，巩固人民革命的胜利。
    目前人民解放战争虽然在大陆上已基本结束，帝国主义与蒋匪的统治势力已被摧毁，中国人民已取得基本的胜利。但如果不进一步废除封建的土地所有制，消灭封建势力，人民革命的胜利是不巩固的，因为，封建的土地制度及在此制度的基础之上所形成的封建势力是中国反动派的根子，是帝国主义在中国的支柱，封建的土地制度不废除，封建势力不消灭，帝国主义和中国反动派就会与封建势力相勾结，进行各种反革命的阴谋活动，甚至武装暴乱，因此我们必须实行土地改革，消灭封建。
    ２、实行土地改革，人民才能获得革命胜利的基本果实，工农联盟和全国人民的政治团结才能巩固。在过去二十年的革命斗争中，农民出力最大，负担最重，出兵、出粮、出民工，都是农民。现在全国胜利了，如果不解决农民期待已久的土地问题，如果农民不能在农村中掌握政权，如果农民得不到革命胜利的果实，农民是一定会很失望的，农民的政治积极性将无法发挥出来。在人民解放战争中，约有一亿四千五百万农业人口的地区实行了土地改革，发动了农民群众，支援人民解放军打败了美蒋反动派的联合进攻，并获得了伟大的全国规模的胜利。在今后三年左右的时间内，将在约二亿六千四百万农业人口的地区实行土地改革，彻底消灭封建势力，完成中国人民民主革命反封建的历史任务，使数约四万万人口的全国农民都获得土地，都在政治上经济上得到翻身，这将使工农联盟无比地巩固起来，成为不可战胜的力量；因而也将使以工农联盟为基础的全国人民的政治团结更加巩固，人民民主专政的新民主主义政权更加巩固，国家的民主化也才能真正实现。
    ３、土地改革使农民从封建剥削和封建压迫下解放出来，自由的农民在自由的土地上耕作，生产热忱一定空前高涨，农业生产将会有显著的增加，农民生活也将有显著的改善。例如，在已经实行了土地改革的地区，东北今年的农业生产将由一九四九年的一千三百多万吨增加到一千八百万吨；山西今年预计将增加耕畜二十五万头；吉林省每个农民余粮二百五十斤，河北省涉县每人余粮一·五石；根据河北、山西、察哈尔的一些调查，农民中的中农已占百分之八十，就是说土地改革前的贫农，现在大都上升为中农了。
    ４、正因为土地改革后农业生产增加了，也才有可能逐渐增加经济作物的种植，解决某些工业的原料的需要；也正因为土地改革后，农民生活逐渐得到改善，农民购买力提高，也就为发展工业创造了广阔的国内市场，为国家的工业化开辟了道路。土地改革完成后的东北，农民今年购买力的总值预计约折合五百六十六万吨粮食，工业品的销售比过去提高了许多。例如东北全区全年的布匹销售量，一九四七年为八十万匹，一九四八年为一百二十万匹，一九四九年为三百二十万匹，而一九五○年将为九百万匹。今年全东北工业生产的总值预计将较去年增加近一倍，即相当于去年的百分之一九三，它在工农业总值中所占的比例，将由去年的百分之三十五增加到百分之四十三。
    ５、土地改革为工业发展扫除了障碍。工业发展了，工人的物质生活也就可以获得改善，全国人民的生活水平也将随之而提高。
    ６、工业农业都有了发展，商业也必随之而发展，对工商业者都是有利的。
    ７、土地改革改善了农民的物质生活，因而也就为开展一个真正的全民性质的新文化运动创造了前提，使教育工作者、文学艺术工作者、卫生工作者取得了在广大农村广泛开展工作的条件。
    ８、妇女解放与全体人民的解放是分不开的，不消灭封建，妇女就不可能得到解放；土地改革是使广大农村妇女走向解放的一个有决定意义的步骤。
    ９、土地改革是使广大农村青年团结起来，组织起来，并从思想上政治上提高的一个有决定意义的步骤。
    三  土地改革消灭了地主阶级；但地主个人在土地改革后还是有出路的，地主应该老老实实地服从人民政府关于土地改革的法令。
    １、土地改革的任务是消灭地主阶级，这是完全必要，不能有丝毫动摇的。但消灭地主阶级并不是从肉体上消灭地主。中央人民政府的土地改革法规定，分给地主一份土地和生产资料，给地主以生活的出路；人民政府并规定，只要地主在土地改革完成后，完全服从政府法令，努力从事劳动生产，或作其他经营，没有任何反动行为，连续五年以上者，就可以改变成份，按照他所从事的劳动或经营的性质决定其为劳动者成份或其他成份。在土地改革后地主不许可再过不劳而食的寄生生活，但他们可以依靠劳动生产或其他营业来生活。他们中间的有些人是有农业技术的，可以从事农业生产；有些人是有文化知识的，可以利用他们的文化知识，从事脑力劳动。此外，土地改革并不侵犯地主兼营的工商业，除按照土地改革法第二条的规定，没收地主的土地、耕畜、农具、多余的粮食及其在农村中的多余的房屋外，地主的其他财产并不没收，所以地主还可以利用那些不被没收的资财经营工商业或其他事业。
    ２、如果地主顽固不化，千方百计地抵抗破坏土地改革，如破坏耕畜、农具和其他财产，分化农民的团结，甚或与美蒋特务土匪相勾结，进行反人民反革命的阴谋活动，以至武装叛乱，人民政府当然要坚决予以镇压，视其情节轻重，分别处以应得的罪刑——从徒刑直到死刑。反动统治的时代是一去不复返了，人民的力量是不可战胜的，人民的政权是推翻不了的，顽固地主想要破坏土地改革，只是玩火自焚，是毫无出路的。
    ３、一些工商业家或其他成份兼地主的人们，只要他们依法缴出其应被没收或应被征收的土地财产后，他们的工商业和他们的直接用于其他职业的土地财产一概保护不动，而且，在土地改革完成后，即照其他成份待遇他们。就是说，他们也卸掉了一个“兼地主”的不名誉的称号。
    至于兼有大量出租土地的半地主式的富农（在某些特殊地区的兼有小量出租土地的富农也包括在内），当他们的出租土地被征收以后，他们所有的自耕和雇人耕种的部分是被保障了，他们更可以安心生产。
    四  大家应该怎样拥护土地改革？
    １、土地改革对全国人民有利，势在必行，任何人不可加以阻碍。土地改革是在新民主主义的历史时期内考验全中国一切人们、一切党派的一“关”，是区别革命派与反革命派，区别完全的革命派与口头的革命派的试金石。一切革命的人民，民主党派，都应当经得起这个考验，并积极地帮助土地改革。地主阶级中的开明分子，应认清大势，切不可妨碍农民分配地主土地的正义要求。
    ２、在将要实施土地改革的地区，人人都应当学习中华人民共和国土地改革法和刘少奇副主席关于土地改革问题的报告，并利用一切机会向别人进行广泛宣传。如果自己的家庭属于地主成份，或者自己的亲友有属于地主成份者，首先应该劝告他们老老实实遵守人民政府的法令，向农民群众低头，依法缴出土地财产，警告他们切勿进行抵抗与破坏。
    ３、在土地改革开始以前，特别是开始以后，地主阶级中一定会有一部分人用各种面貌进行造谣，诬蔑和叫嚣，以反对土地改革。对此必须提高警惕，切勿上当，成为地主阶级的应声虫。而要站稳立场，驳斥地主阶级的造谣，诬蔑，严正地维护政府法令和农民利益。
    ４、当然，这样伟大的成万万人参加的土地改革的革命运动，不可避免地会发生若干缺点和偏向，我们应该对这些缺点和偏向，善意地提出批评和改进的意见，而不应该片面地夸大或歪曲事实，以致被地主阶级所利用。
