Clarify Inventory of Materials, Oppose Localism
Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Tianjin Discover Large Quantities of Under-Reported Steel, Wood, and Cement

(Our Report) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Supervision, in conjunction with the Provincial Planning Commission and the Provincial Bureau of Statistics, began a general survey of inventory materials in major industrial and mining enterprises in twelve major cities throughout the province in mid-January. The survey revealed that many units had under-reported, failed to report, and concealed their inventory. Based on preliminary inspection results from twenty-four units in six cities—Nanjing, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Nantong, Lianyungang, and Taizhou—a total of more than 870 tons of steel and more than 3,000 cubic meters of wood were under-reported.

During the inspection, it was discovered that in a situation where industrial raw materials were very tight, factories and mines, and even some industrial leadership departments, had begun to foster localist thinking. They tried every means to retain more inventory and even consciously concealed it. For example, the Nanjing Municipal First Local Industry Bureau, at the instigation of a deputy director, knowingly altered the reported figures for pig iron inventory, changing the original 878 tons to 418 tons. The Wuxi Power Machine Factory, fearing that the truth about its inventory would be discovered, issued fifteen fake IOUs, including more than 14 tons of various steels and 1,350 bearings. Upon inspection, these materials were still in the warehouse. Some units hid materials in basements, covering them with waste materials, fearing being "exposed as rich" and fearing "being transferred upwards." The head of the supply and marketing section of the Changzhou Dacheng No. 1 Factory openly said, "Accumulation is better than being out of stock. Without localism, where does the sense of responsibility come from?!" Because some units' material inventory figures could not be truthfully reported, the rational allocation of raw materials and the full utilization of existing inventory were affected.

The situation of snapping up materials was also very serious in the procurement of raw materials.

The Nanjing Municipal First Local Industry Bureau specially established a Materials Management Office outside of the established structure, controlling the supply and sales of raw materials and finished products of the twelve factories under its jurisdiction. It controlled 2 million yuan in bank loans, and purchasing agents could carry tens of thousands of yuan in cash to engage in activities everywhere, even buying materials that were not needed as capital for barter. The bureau strictly controlled internally and implemented a blockade externally, which some people likened to a materials "trust." Obviously, such unscrupulous grabbing of materials not only created an artificial shortage of raw materials, but also strained the enterprises' working capital, affecting the enterprises' correct operation. The Jiangsu Province and municipal supervisory departments are now preparing to conduct further in-depth inspections of the procurement, use, and storage of materials in factories and mines. They also require the Party committees in various localities and factories and mines to strengthen the Party's political leadership while encouraging active solutions to raw material problems.

(Our Report) The Shanxi Provincial Department of Supervision, the Provincial Bureau of Statistics, and the Provincial Bureau of Material Supply recently organized more than sixty cadres, under the personal leadership of Deputy Governor Jiao Guonai, to conduct a focused inspection of the inventory materials of forty-eight units in the local industrial production and basic construction departments. In the material inventory survey on January 1st, it was discovered that a total of more than 1,100 tons of various steels and pig iron, and more than 10,000 cubic meters of wood, as well as a large quantity of cement and wire, were under-reported to the state.

According to incomplete statistics from eight units such as the Taiyuan No. 55 Iron Factory and the Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Company, 390 tons of steel, 172 tons of pig iron, 8,146 cubic meters of wood, and 2,850 bags of cement were under-reported. The proportion of under-reported materials in many units was very large. For example, the steel and wood under-reported by the three factories under the Public Security Bureau accounted for 51% and 14% of the original reported figures, respectively.

The reasons for the above situation are that, on the one hand, material management work was chaotic, resulting in discrepancies between accounts and actual inventory and unclear inventory; on the other hand—and this is the main aspect—the cadres of many units had localist thinking, intentionally laying ambushes in the material inventory reporting, and even concealing at each level and under-reporting at each level. In order to get more materials from higher authorities, the Taiyuan Iron Factory removed 338 tons of pig iron and steel from its accounts on December 31 last year. The units under the Datong Municipal Engineering Company actually had 68 tons of small steel, but only reported 55 tons to the company, and the company only reported 27 tons to higher authorities. The company under-reported various types of wood and wire by 50% on the basis of intentional under-reporting by its various work areas.

(Our Report) Since January 10, Tianjin has organized inspection teams to conduct focused inspections of the inventory of production and construction units. In only eight units, including the Tianjin Machine Tool Factory, the Joint State-Private Boiler Manufacturing Factory, and some companies under the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, more than 2,700 tons of various steels, pig iron, and scrap steel were under-reported and concealed. The Tianjin Machine Tool Factory under-reported and failed to report a total of more than 200 tons of steel, pig iron, and scrap. According to preliminary statistics, the First, Second, and Fifth Construction Engineering Companies under the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau under-reported more than 200 tons of steel and more than 1,000 cubic meters of wood.

The inspection teams are currently conducting further in-depth inspections.

### 查清库存物资、反对本位主义  江苏山西天津发现大批漏报的钢材木材水泥

    查清库存物资、反对本位主义
    江苏山西天津发现大批漏报的钢材木材水泥
    本报讯　江苏省监察厅会同省计划委员会、省统计局，于1月中旬开始，对全省十二个主要城市的工矿企业进行库存物资普查，发现不少单位有少报、漏报和隐瞒库存的现象。根据南京、无锡、徐州、南通、新海连、泰州六个市二十四个单位初步检查结果，共少报漏报钢铁八百七十多吨，木材三千多立方公尺。
    检查中，发现各厂矿甚至某些工业领导部门在工业原材料十分紧张的情况下，又开始滋长了本位主义的思想，他们千方百计地设法多留库存，甚至有意识地隐瞒不报。如南京市第一地方工业局，在一位副局长的怂恿下，明知故犯地涂改了生铁库存的上报数字，将原来的八百七十八吨改为四百十八吨。无锡市动力机厂唯恐库存实情被发觉，便开出十五张假借据，包括各种钢材十四吨多，轴承一千三百五十只，经检查，这些材料仍留在仓库里。有些单位把材料隐藏在地下室，上面用废料掩盖起来，生怕“露富”，生怕“上调”。常州大成一厂供销科长公开地说：“积压总比脱销好，没有本位主义那来的责任心？！”由于某些单位的材料库存数字不能真实上报，因而影响到原材料的合理调配与现有库存物资的充分利用。
    在原材料的采购上，抢购物资的情况也很严重。
    南京市地方工业一局在编制以外专门成立了一个材料经理室，控制了所属十二个厂的原材料和成品的供销业务，掌握了二百万元银行贷款，采购员可携带几万元现金四出活动，连不需要的材料也买回来，作为物物交换的本钱。该局对内严加控制，对外实行封锁，有人喻之为材料“托辣斯”。显然，这样不择手段的乱抓材料，不仅造成原材料人为紧张的局面，而且企业的流动资金也随着发生紧张，影响企业的正确经营。现江苏省及市的监察部门正在准备进一步对厂矿企业的材料采购、使用、保管进行深入检查。并要求各地及厂矿的党委在鼓励积极解决原材料的同时，必须加强党的政治领导。
    本报讯　山西省监察厅、省统计局和省物资供应局最近组织了六十多名干部，在副省长焦国鼐的亲自领导下，对地方工业生产和基本建设部门四十八个单位的库存物资作了重点检查。在1月1日的物资普查中，发现向国家漏报的各种钢材和生铁共达一千一百多吨，木材共达一万多立方公尺，此外还有大批水泥、线材等物资。
    根据太原市五五铁工厂和太原市政工程公司等八个单位的不完全统计，漏报的钢材有三百九十吨，生铁一百七十二吨，木材八千一百四十六立方公尺，水泥二千八百五十袋。不少单位漏报物资的比重是很大的，如公安厅所属三个工厂漏报的钢材和木材，分别占原报数字的51％和14％。
    造成以上情况的原因，一方面是由于材料管理工作混乱，形成了账目和实际不符及库存不清的现象；另一方面也是主要的一方面，是不少单位的干部有本位主义思想，在物资普查上报中有意打埋伏，甚至层层隐瞒，逐级少报。太原铁工厂为了向上级多要材料，于去年12月31日将三百三十八吨生铁和钢材出了账。大同市工程公司所属单位实有小型钢材六十八吨，但只向公司报了五十五吨，而公司向上级只报了二十七吨。各种木材和线材，该公司在所属各工区有意少报的基础上，又少报了50％。
    本报讯　天津市从1月10日起，组织检查组，有重点地检查了生产和建筑单位库存情况。仅天津市机床厂、公私合营锅炉制造厂和天津市建筑工程局所属部分公司等八个单位，漏报、隐报的各种钢材、生铁和废钢材等就有两千七百多吨。天津市机床厂少报、未报的钢材、生铁和废料等共二百多吨。据初步统计，天津市建筑工程局所属第一、二、五建筑工程公司漏报的钢材有二百多吨，木材有一千多立方公尺。
    目前检查组正进一步深入检查。
