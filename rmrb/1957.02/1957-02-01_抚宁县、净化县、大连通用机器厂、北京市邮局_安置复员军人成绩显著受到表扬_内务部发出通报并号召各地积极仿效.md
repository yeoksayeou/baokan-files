Xinhua News Agency, January 31st – The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China yesterday issued a circular commending Funing County in Hebei Province, Jinghua Township in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, Dalian Universal Machinery Factory in Liaoning Province, and the Beijing Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for their outstanding achievements in resettling demobilized soldiers.

The circular pointed out: The achievements made by the above-mentioned regions and units in the work of resettling demobilized soldiers are mainly reflected in their good implementation of the state's demobilization and resettlement policies, actively receiving and resettling demobilized soldiers, educating demobilized soldiers to become familiar with production techniques and improve their professional skills, and caring for and helping demobilized soldiers solve practical difficulties in production and life, so that demobilized soldiers returning to these regions and units can be properly resettled and play an active role in various production and work positions. All of this is worthy of emulation by all localities.

The circular also attached materials on the resettlement of demobilized soldiers in these regions and units.

Funing County has received and resettled more than 3,300 demobilized soldiers since 1950. The county party committee attaches great importance to doing a good job in resettling demobilized soldiers, and a social atmosphere of caring for demobilized soldiers has been established throughout the county from top to bottom.

While resettling demobilized soldiers to engage in agricultural production, the county also arranges demobilized soldiers with specialized skills and a certain level of education to engage in other occupations besides agricultural production. The county's directly affiliated organs have implemented the principle of giving priority to employing demobilized soldiers, and all units actively absorb demobilized soldiers when they need to recruit personnel. In order to continuously improve the awareness of demobilized soldiers, in addition to instructing township and village grassroots organizations to regularly pay attention to conducting political and ideological education for demobilized soldiers, they have also specially established demobilized soldiers' study stations in some townships. Demobilized soldiers have also played an active role in various positions. Among the 200 demobilized soldiers resettled in organs and enterprises, more than 50 have been promoted to leading staff. The vast majority of demobilized soldiers resettled in rural areas are content with agricultural production and have become a vital force in agricultural production and rural work. According to statistics, the number of activists who have emerged has reached 66.5% of the total number of demobilized soldiers.

In addition to helping demobilized soldiers solve practical difficulties in production and building families in a timely manner, the leading cadres of Jinghua Township in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, also often hold forums for demobilized soldiers to educate them to actively engage in production and work hard. They pay special attention to cultivating typical examples among demobilized soldiers to promote all-round development, so that all 59 demobilized soldiers in the township can actively participate in production and work. Currently, 36 demobilized soldiers have respectively served as township heads, township party branch secretaries, township civil affairs, finance and grain, and security committee members, and agricultural cooperative directors and deputy directors, and other important positions.

Jinghua Township also attaches great importance to helping unmarried demobilized soldiers get married and start families. The township's party and government leaders and the township's Communist Youth League and Women's Federation organizations have taken measures to help unmarried demobilized soldiers solve their marriage problems. The township leaders often introduce good and bad examples of solving marriage problems to demobilized soldiers, and publicize the honor and loveliness of demobilized soldiers among the masses, inspiring the masses to respect and love demobilized soldiers. With the help of the masses and cadres, 52 of the 59 demobilized soldiers in the township have already gotten married.

The Dalian Universal Machinery Factory has been continuously rated as a model unit for resettling demobilized soldiers in Lushun-Dalian City and Liaoning Province for the past three years. The factory has resolutely implemented the decision to give priority to employing demobilized soldiers, and has received and resettled 120 demobilized soldiers in recent years; demobilized soldiers who originally joined the army from the factory are all allowed to resume work and their positions. After the demobilized soldiers arrive at the factory, they are also organized to visit various workshops and conduct short-term safety production knowledge learning, and then their opinions on the allocation of work are solicited. Then, the personnel department allocates them to appropriate work positions according to the needs of each workshop, their physical conditions, education level, technical level, and their personal requirements for work.

The factory also attaches importance to the training and education of demobilized soldiers and helps them solve difficulties in life and marriage, etc.

The Beijing Post Office has received and resettled 270 demobilized soldiers in recent years. When assigning demobilized soldiers to work, the bureau assigns them to appropriate work positions according to their education level, work ability, physical condition, and personal aspirations for work. After some units have assigned demobilized soldiers to work, after a period of actual work, they organize seminars or individual visits to solicit their opinions on the assigned work again, and make adjustments to those that are not appropriately assigned. When determining the salary and benefits of demobilized soldiers, their revolutionary qualifications and original ranks in the army are taken into consideration. Demobilized soldiers assigned to work in various units also have special personnel responsible for helping them become familiar with the business. The administration and trade union of this post office are also very concerned about the housing, marriage, and illness of demobilized soldiers, and specifically help them solve various difficulties.

    安置复员军人成绩显著受到表扬
    内务部发出通报并号召各地积极仿效
    新华社31日讯　中华人民共和国内务部昨天通报表扬了安置复员军人成绩显著的河北省抚宁县、山西省平遥县净化乡、辽宁省大连通用机器厂、邮电部北京市邮局等四个地区和单位。
    通报指出：上述地区和单位在安置复员军人工作中所取得的成绩，主要表现在很好地贯彻和执行了国家的复员安置政策，积极地接收、安置复员军人，教育复员军人熟悉生产技术和提高业务能力，关心和帮助复员军人解决生产、生活上的实际困难，使回到这些地区和单位的复员军人，都能得到妥善的安置，在各个生产和工作岗位上发挥积极作用。所有这些都值得各地方仿效。
    通报还附发了这些地区和单位安置复员军人的情况的材料。
    抚宁县从1950年以来共接收、安置了三千三百多名复员军人。县委对于做好安置复员军人工作很重视，全县从上到下树立了一种关心复员军人的社会风气。
    这个县在安置复员军人从事农业生产的同时，还安排有专门技术和有一定文化水平的复员军人从事农业生产以外的其他职业。县的直属机关执行了优先录用复员军人的原则、各单位需要录用人员时，都主动地吸收复员军人。为了不断提高复员军人的觉悟，除责成乡、村基层组织经常注意对复员军人进行政治思想教育外，还特地在某些乡试建了复员军人学习站。复员军人在各个岗位上也发挥了积极作用。安置在机关企业中的二百名复员军人，有五十多名已被提拔为领导工作人员。安置在农村的复员军人绝大部分安心农业生产，并已成为农业生产和农村工作中的生力军，据统计，已经涌现出来的积极分子，达到了复员军人总数的66.5％。
    山西省平遥县净化乡的领导干部除了及时帮助复员军人解决生产建家上的实际困难以外，还经常召开复员军人座谈会，教育复员军人积极生产、努力工作，特别注意在复员军人中培养典型，推动全面，使全乡五十九名复员军人都能积极地参加生产和工作，现在已有三十六名复员军人分别担任了乡长、乡党支书、乡民政、财粮和治安委员、农业社正副社长等重要职务。
    净化乡还很重视帮助未婚的复员军人结婚成家。乡的党政领导和乡的青年团、妇联组织一起采取措施帮助未婚的复员军人解决婚姻问题，乡的领导经常向复员军人介绍解决婚姻问题的好坏事例，并且在群众中宣传复员军人的光荣可爱，启发群众尊重和热爱复员军人。全乡五十九名复员军人，在群众和干部的帮助下，已经有五十二人结了婚。
    大连通用机器厂三年来连续被评为旅大市和辽宁省的安置复员军人模范单位。这个厂坚决执行了优先录用复员军人的决定，几年来共接收安置复员军人一百二十名；对于原从本厂参军的复员军人，一律准许他们复工和复职。复员军人到厂后还组织他们到各车间参观和进行短时期的安全生产知识的学习，再征求他们对分配工作的意见，然后由人事部门根据各车间生产的需要和他们的身体条件、文化程度、技术水平以及他们个人对工作的要求，把他们分配到适当的工作岗位上去。
    这个厂还重视对复员军人的培养教育工作和帮助他们解决生活上的困难和婚姻问题等。
    北京市邮局几年来共接收安置复员军人二百七十名。这个局在分配复员军人工作的时候，都根据他们的文化程度、工作能力、身体条件和个人对工作的愿望，分配他们到适当的工作岗位上去。有些单位在分配复员军人工作以后，经过了一个阶段的实际工作，再组织座谈或个别访问，再次征求他们对所分配工作的意见，对分配得不够适当的还进行调整。在确定复员军人的工资待遇时，都照顾到他们的革命资历和原在部队的职级。分配到各个单位里工作的复员军人，还都有专人负责帮助他们熟悉业务。这个邮局的行政和工会对复员军人的住房、婚姻、疾病等问题也很关心，具体地帮助他们解决了各种困难。
