    Influencing Comrades with One's Own Example
    – On Comrade Zeng Xianhui, Procurator-General of the Guizhou Procuratorate, and His Self-Disciplined and Thrifty Style
    By our reporter Xiao Ming
    After the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party issued a call to all state personnel to be hardworking and simple and to share weal and woe with the masses, Comrade Wu Shi, Vice Governor of Guizhou Province, introduced me to the deeds of Comrade Zeng Xianhui, Procurator-General of the Provincial Procuratorate. He told me: Comrade Zeng Xianhui has consistently maintained a style of hard work, simplicity, and close ties with the masses from the time of the First Revolutionary Civil War until now. He is a living example for us in this regard.
    So, I visited some comrades in the Procuratorate who are working with Comrade Zeng Xianhui, and several of Comrade Zeng Xianhui's old colleagues and comrades-in-arms.
    Comrade Zeng Xianhui possesses a very valuable quality of self-discipline. During the difficult war years, his horse was always given to the sick and wounded or used to carry luggage for comrades. What about now? He often pushes comrades onto the car prepared for him. Once, when there were too many people attending a meeting and there was not enough space in the car, he pushed the comrades into the car, closed the door from the outside, told the driver to drive, and walked home himself. When going out to meetings, he always walks if there is enough time, instead of taking the car. Not long ago, his child, who is in elementary school, saw some classmates being driven home in cars on Saturdays and back to school on Sundays, became envious, and asked his father to pick him up and drop him off in the car. Comrade Zeng Xianhui patiently educated his child, saying: "It is not glorious to go to school by car. Labor through walking is the most glorious thing. Besides, the car belongs to the public. I take the car for work, why do you need to take the car?" He worked as a material custodian for a long time and never arbitrarily used a single needle or thread. Despite the piles of beautiful bedding accumulated in the warehouse, he always slept under his coarse cloth quilt and on a wheat straw mattress. He also stubbornly refused the general affairs department to set up sofas, glass tops, and desk lamps in his office and dormitory. He likes to drink tea. When the staff saw that his tea was used up, they got a packet of tea from the general affairs section and put it in his office. He sternly questioned the staff, saying: "Can't I buy my own tea? Who told you to get it from the general affairs section?" During the war, the troops and government offices lived together with the masses. When he saw any difficulties the masses had, he always tried to help them solve them. Now, he still often seizes time to go deep among the masses. In the half year of 1956, he spent two months in the countryside, entering every township and district along the way. He looked for cadres and the masses to understand their production and living conditions and to understand the implementation of the Party's policies. The opinions of the people that were reflected to the Procuratorate were often the main content of his speeches at the provincial committee meetings. In the office, everyone from cadres to cleaning staff are his friends, and comrades feel mentally happy and comfortable being with him. In recent years, he has talked to every new comrade who is transferred to work in the Procuratorate to understand their ideological situation and difficulties. If some comrades said in front of him that his life was very frugal, he always said seriously and earnestly: "Compared to the peasants, and compared to the past, it is already much higher. What are you talking about frugality?"
    Comrade Zeng Xianhui has been a Party member since 1930, for twenty-seven years now. Twenty-seven years is not a short time. He has made many contributions to the revolution. Comrade Zeng Xianhui participated in the reconnaissance and command tasks of the famous Red Army's crossing of the Wujiang River. But he has not been proud of these achievements. He said to many comrades: "Today's work is enough for me. I always don't do the work well, I can't do it." He works with great interest and conscientiousness in any position. He is usually the earliest to arrive and the latest to leave the Procuratorate's office. He not only leads comrades with his administrative position, but more importantly, he influences comrades with his example.

    用自己的榜样影响同志们
    ——记贵州检察院检察长曾宪辉同志克己俭朴的作风
    本报记者　肖明
    在党的八届二中全会向国家全体工作人员提出艰苦朴素、与群众同甘共苦的号召以后，贵州省副省长吴实同志，向我介绍了省检察院检察长曾宪辉同志的事迹。他告诉我：曾宪辉同志从第一次国内革命战争时期直到现在，一贯地保持着艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的作风，他在这方面是我们的活榜样。
    于是，我走访了正和曾宪辉同志一起工作着的检察院的一些同志，走访了几位曾宪辉同志的老同事、老战友。
    曾宪辉同志具有一种非常可贵的克己的品质。在艰苦的战争年代里，他的马总是给病号骑，给同志们驮行李。现在呢？他常把同志们推上为他准备的汽车。有一次开会的人多，车坐不下，他把同志们推上车，从车外边关上车门，让司机开车，而自己却步行回家。出外开会，只要时间来得及，他总是不坐汽车，走着去。不久以前，他的上小学的小孩看到有些同学星期六坐小汽车回家，星期天又坐小汽车回校，羡慕起来，要求他父亲也用小汽车接送。曾宪辉同志就耐心地教育小孩说：“坐汽车上学并不光荣，走路劳动才是最光荣的事情。再说，汽车是公家的，我坐汽车是为了工作，你为什么要坐汽车呢？”他做过长期的保管物资的工作，从来没有随便抽用过一针一线；尽管接收过来的漂亮被褥堆积成库，他总是盖着自己的粗布被、铺着麦草褥。他还固执地拒绝总务部门为他的办公室和宿舍设置沙发、玻璃板、台灯。他好喝茶，公务员看到他的茶叶喝完了，从总务科领来一包茶叶放在他的办公室里。他严肃地责问公务员说：“我自己不会买茶叶？谁叫你到总务科去领。”在战争时期，部队、机关都和群众生活在一起。他看到群众有什么困难，总要想办法去帮助他们解决。现在，他仍然经常抓时间深入到群众中去。1956年的半年时间里，他下乡两个月，沿途过乡进乡、过区进区。找干部找群众，了解他们的生产和生活情况，了解党的政策执行情况。人民群众反映到检察院的意见，常是他在省委会上的主要发言内容。在机关里，从干部到勤杂人员都是他的朋友，同志们和他在一起感到精神上的愉快和舒畅。几年来，每一个新调到检察院工作的同志，他都要找来谈谈话，了解新来同志的思想情况和困难。有的同志要是当着他的面说他生活很俭朴，他总是严肃而认真地说：“和农民比，和过去比，已经高得许多了，还说什么俭朴。”
    曾宪辉同志从1930年入党到现在已经二十七年了。二十七年不是个短暂的时光，他为革命建立过许多功勋，有名的红军强渡乌江天险，曾宪辉同志就参加执行了侦察指挥任务。但他并没有因这些骄傲过，他向许多同志们说：“今天的工作就够我干了，工作总是作不好，作不了。”他在任何岗位上都是津津有味、兢兢业业地工作着。检察院的办公室里，通常总是他来得最早，走得最晚。他不只是用自己的行政地位来领导同志们，更重要的，是以他的榜样影响着同志们。
