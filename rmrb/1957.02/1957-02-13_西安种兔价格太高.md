    High Price of Breeding Rabbits in Xi'an
    Recently, the prices of good-quality domestic breeding rabbits in Xi'an have been very high. In the free market, some rabbits are selling for 30 or 40 yuan, or even 50 or 60 yuan each. A member of an agricultural cooperative spent 126 yuan to buy a pair of rabbits. Some people have commented: "The price of one rabbit is equal to the price of three donkeys."
    Since the government has been actively promoting the development of sideline production, many agricultural cooperatives and farmers are very interested in raising rabbits, and the number of people buying breeding rabbits is also increasing. Because the supply of breeding rabbits cannot meet the demand, some small merchants in the market are taking the opportunity to raise rabbit prices. Some small merchants travel to Shandong and other places to transport rabbits, and then sell them at high prices in the Xi'an market. Some agricultural cooperatives in Shandong, seeing the high rabbit prices in Xi'an, buy rabbits in the Shandong market and then bring them to Xi'an to sell, making exorbitant profits. The Jiuli Agricultural Cooperative in Weizhuang District, Huang County, Shandong, sent people with more than 100 rabbits to Xi'an for sale, and they were all sold out soon.
    The high price of breeding rabbits will inevitably hinder the enthusiasm of farmers to raise rabbits. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay attention to solving this problem. Guo Yunchi

### 西安种兔价格太高

    西安种兔价格太高
    最近，西安市优良的种家兔的价格很高。在自由市场上，有的兔子要卖三、四十元甚至五、六十元一只。一个农业社社员，买一对兔子，花了一百二十六元。一些人反映：“一只兔子的价钱等于三头驴的价钱。”
    在政府积极提倡发展副业生产以后，许多农业社和农民都很喜欢养兔，买种兔的也日益增多。由于种兔供不应求，市场上的一些小商贩就乘机哄抬兔价。有的小商贩跑到山东等地去贩运兔子，回到西安后便以高价在市场上出售。山东一些农业社，见西安兔价高，便在山东市场上收购兔子，以后再带兔子到西安出卖，牟取暴利。山东黄县位庄区九里农业社，派人带了一百多只兔子到西安出售，不久就全部卖光了。
    种兔价格太高，必然妨碍农民养兔的积极性。希望有关部门注意解决这个问题。　郭韵箎
