    Rambling Talk on the Utilization of Old Books
    Gu Tian
    Since liberation, the country has made great efforts to meet the cultural needs of the people. The number of books published nationwide has increased from over 100 million copies in the early days of liberation to 1.6 billion copies. However, because China is a large country with a large population, it is quite difficult to meet the rapidly growing need for spiritual food in a short period of time. In order to overcome the situation of supply falling short of demand for books, in addition to increasing paper production, increasing the number of publications and distribution, and improving the quality of books, we should also find some other solutions.
    I remember when I was studying in Tokyo more than 20 years ago, we, a group of relatively poor students studying in Japan, liked to visit second-hand bookstores and stalls. Around Tokyo Imperial University and the Kanda Jimbocho area, there were rows and rows of second-hand bookstores, even more than the bookstores on Qipan Street in Shanghai. There were also many second-hand book stalls at the night market. These second-hand bookstores and stalls both sold and bought books. You could also exchange your extra books for the books you chose, and make up the difference in value as needed. Of course, the owners of these second-hand bookstores and stalls were all doing business for profit, but with more competitors, they were forced to adopt a business policy of small profits and quick turnover, which was very popular with students and intellectuals. Furthermore, although they were called old books, sometimes newly published books, only a day or two old, would appear on the old book stalls. Although books read by others might have some stains or damage, they were much cheaper. This not only reduces the economic burden on readers, but also greatly improves the utilization rate of books, because the books we read can generally be divided into two categories: one category is precious or tool-like books, such as ancient rare books, masterpieces, dictionaries, engineering, science and technology manuals, etc., which are worth preserving after reading; the other category is ordinary books or books for reference and browsing on a certain issue, which do not need to be retained after reading, such as magazines, novels, etc. Sometimes what you classify as the first category, I classify as the second. If you insist on keeping books that you don't need to keep, then you will have more and more books, which is not only inconvenient to store, but also a waste. But what is useless to you may be very useful to others.
    In the past, in the old society of our country, those who had no money could not afford to read, and most of those who could afford to read did not care about the money to buy a few books. Moreover, there was only a trend of buying books in society, and no trend of selling books. Friends who sold books were regarded as impoverished, and it was considered dishonorable and unseemly. Except for precious books that had some outlets, usually selling old books only meant selling them to junk collectors as waste paper by the pound, often worth very little. Therefore, those with extra books were unwilling to sell them. Over time, there were more and more old books, piled up in heaps, which turned useful old books into useless objects, which is really a pity.
    At present, there are very few second-hand bookstores and stalls in our country. After the "high tide," there is only outflow and no inflow, and the source of goods has become a problem. For this reason, I suggest that the relevant departments set up more second-hand bookstores and stalls, or set up special counters for selling old books in bookstores, and promote the business of buying, selling, and exchanging old books, and change the social atmosphere. It is of great benefit to the exchange of what one has for what one needs and the utilization of discarded books.

    漫谈旧书利用
    古田
    解放以来，国家对满足人民的文化要求尽了很大的努力，全国图书出版数额由解放初期的一亿多册增加到十六亿册，但由于我国是一个人口众多的大国，要在短期内满足人民的急剧增长的精神食粮的需要是比较困难的。为了克服图书供不应求的局面，除了增产纸张，增加出版发行数量，提高图书质量外，还应该找出一些别的出路。
    记得笔者二十多年前在东京读书的时候，我们这一帮比较穷的留日学生最喜欢逛旧书店和旧书摊，在东京帝大附近和神田区神保町一带旧书店林立，比我国上海棋盘街上的书店还要多得多，一户挨一户。夜市上还有许多旧书摊。这些旧书店旧书摊，都是既卖亦买，还可以拿你多余的书交换你选中的书，视价值相抵与否找出或找进。当然这些旧书店、摊的业主们都是为了牟利营生，但是竞争者一多，又逼使他们采取薄利多转的经营方针，因此很受学生和知识分子的欢迎。并且名为旧书，有时刚出版一两天的新书，就会出现在旧书摊上，别人看过的书虽然略有点污渍或折损，但价钱却便宜得多。这样既可以减轻读者的经济负担，又可以大大地提高书籍的利用率，因为我们阅读的书籍大体可以分成两类：一类是珍贵的或工具性的书籍，如古籍珍本、名著、词典、工程、科学技术手册等等，读完了以后还有保存的价值；另一类是普通的或为某一问题作参考浏览的书，看过一遍，即无保留的必要，如杂志小说等等。有时在你列为第一类，在我又属第二类。看过的书如无必要保存的，也硬要把它保存起来，那末书就多了，不仅保存起来不方便，也是一种浪费。但是在你是无用之物，在他人也许很有用处。
    过去我国旧社会无钱的读不起书，读得起书的多半不在乎买几本书的钱，而且社会上只有买书的风气，没有卖书的风气，把卖书的朋友视为破落户，并且认为是不光彩不体面的事情。除了珍贵的书籍有点出路，通常卖旧书只有求之于收破烂论斤当废纸卖，往往值不得几文钱。因此有余书的人也不愿出卖，日积月累，旧书愈来愈多，一堆一堆的放在那里，这样就把有用的旧书化为无用之物，实在很可惜。
    我国目前旧书店、摊很少，“高潮”之后，有出无进，货源已成问题。为此我建议有关方面多增设一些旧书店、摊，或在书店内设些经营旧书的专柜，提倡一下旧书买卖交换的业务，改改社会风气。对于互通有无，废书利用是大有好处的。
