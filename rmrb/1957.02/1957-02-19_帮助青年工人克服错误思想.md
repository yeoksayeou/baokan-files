    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Young workers at the First Automobile Works have received a vivid political and ideological education during the increase production and practice economy campaign.

    Around the Spring Festival, in the workshops, many young workers gathered around machine tools to listen to veteran workers talk about their hard lives and unfortunate experiences in the old society, which gave the young workers a deeper understanding of life in the old society. When Gu Bingpei, a veteran worker from the compressor division of the engine workshop, told the more than sixty young workers in his division that he had not even touched a machine tool in his four years as an apprentice in Shanghai in the past, many were deeply moved. Of the eleven workers on the connecting rod production line, nine had originally demanded to be transferred if they were not promoted or given a pay raise. During the discussion of Gu Bingpei's report, they all examined their erroneous ideas.

    More than 6,000 young workers at the First Automobile Works heard reports about the story of the 25,000-li Long March. After the reports, various units held discussions. Many young workers expressed that they wanted to learn from the revolutionary predecessors' spirit of hard work and plain living. Previously, some workers were unwilling to live in simple dormitories and insisted on standard dormitories with water, electricity, gas, toilets, and bathrooms. Some individual workers even wanted to live in small, single-family courtyards. After education, the situation of picking and choosing housing has recently decreased significantly. Not long ago, a batch of simple dormitories was distributed smoothly.

    Young workers at the First Automobile Works account for more than 70% of the factory's employees. Before entering the factory, most of them were graduates of junior and senior primary schools in urban and rural areas, as well as unemployed young people in society. In response to the non-working-class ideological problems that have emerged among these young workers, the Communist Party organizations, administrative departments, trade unions, and Communist Youth League of each workshop have organized various forms of propaganda and education since the beginning of the year as part of the ideological construction work to promote the increase production and practice economy campaign.

    帮助青年工人克服错误思想
    据新华社讯　第一汽车制造厂青年工人在增产节约运动中受到了生动的政治思想教育。
    春节前后，在各个车间的机床旁边，许多青年工人围在一起听老工人讲述他们在旧社会的困苦生活和不幸的遭遇，使得青年工人对于旧社会的生活有了比较深刻的了解。发动机车间压缩机工部老工人顾炳培，向本部六十多名青年工人讲到他过去在上海学徒四年还没有摸到机床等情况的时候，许多人都很受感动。小连杠生产线的十一名工人中，原来有九名工人说不给晋级和增加工资，就要求调动工作。他们在座谈顾炳培的报告的时候，都检讨了自己的错误想法。
    第一汽车制造厂有六千多名青年工人听到了关于二万五千里长征故事的报告，各单位在报告以后都举行了漫谈会，许多青年工人表示要学习革命前辈的艰苦朴素精神。以前有些工人不愿意住简易宿舍，非要水、电、煤气、厕所、洗浴间俱全的标准宿舍不可，甚至个别工人要住一家一户的小庭院。经过教育以后，挑选房子的情况最近已经显著减少。不久以前，一批简易宿舍很顺利地分配下去了。
    第一汽车制造厂青年工人占全厂职工70％多。他们在入厂以前，大多是城乡初中和高小毕业生以及社会失学失业青年。各车间中共党组织、行政、工会、青年团针对这些青年工人中间出现的非工人阶级思想问题，从年初开始组织了多种多样形式的宣传教育，作为开展增产节约的思想建设工作。
