    Anshan Metal Structure Factory Worker Wei Qingyu
    Saves Over 250 Tons of Steel in Three Years
    (Our Dispatch) According to the "Liaoning Daily" report, Wei Qingyu, a layout worker and member of the Communist Youth League at the Anshan Metal Structure Factory, has saved over 250 tons of good steel for the country in the past three years.
    Wei Qingyu only put down his hoe and joined the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel in October 1951, and was transferred to the layout room at the end of 1953. At that time, he thought: "A layout worker is like a tailor, I have to be a good tailor, and I can't use good cloth as bad cloth, or use a large piece of cloth to mend socks." Under the domination of this idea, every time he received a task, he would first study whether he could use old steel and semi-finished materials to replace it, and how to mark out more materials to save more steel. Once, when marking out a platform beam for a steel rolling mill, the material warehouse sent a batch of new and complete I-beams. Wei Qingyu felt it was a pity to use such good steel, so he tried to find old steel and semi-finished materials to replace it; when marking, he fully applied the two working methods he had figured out to save a lot of steel—nesting and marking according to the material shape, which saved the country more than 25 tons of steel at once. Doing so was very troublesome, and he often couldn't get more overtime bonuses because of it. But he said: "As long as it is good for the country, what does it matter if I am a little tired or get less salary!"
    Every time Wei Qingyu marked a batch of materials, he had to find out what the batch of materials was used for, what the requirements were, and what kind of materials to use. In the past three years, he has not had a single rework job, and some errors in the drawings have not escaped his eyes. In October 1955 alone, he discovered that the design of the furnace bottom and furnace waist of a blast furnace in a certain place was unreasonable and took the initiative to propose modification suggestions, which saved the country more than 50 tons of steel.
    In this production increase and economy drive, this expert in saving steel has set himself a new and higher goal – to save 100 tons of good steel a year.

    鞍山金属结构制造厂工人魏庆余
    三年节约二百五十多吨钢材
    本报讯　据“辽宁日报”消息，鞍山金属结构制造厂划线工人、青年团员魏庆余，三年来为国家节约了二百五十多吨好钢材。
    魏庆余是1951年10月才放下锄头参加鞍钢建设的，1953年底调到划线室。当时他想：“划线工好像个裁缝，我可得当个好裁缝，不能把好布当坏布用，也不能把大块布拿去补袜子。”在这个思想的支配下，他每接到一项任务，都先研究能不能用旧钢材和半成材代替，怎样才能号出更多的料，节约更多的钢材。有一次号一个轧钢厂的平台梁，材料库送来的是一色又新又完整的工字钢。魏庆余觉得用这样好的钢材太可惜了，就设法找旧钢材和半成材代替；号的时候又充分运用了自己摸索出来的两项可以大量节约钢材的工作法——套号和按料形号，一次就给国家节约钢材二十五吨。这样做是很费事的，他也经常因此拿不到更多的超额奖金。可是他说：“只要对国家有好处，自己累一点或者少拿点工资算得什么！”
    魏庆余每号一批料，都要弄清楚这批料是哪上面用的、要求怎样、要用什么样的材料等等。三年来，他没有出过一次返工活，图纸上的一些差讹，也没有逃过他的眼睛。仅1955年10月发现某地一号高炉炉底、炉腰设计不合理并主动提出修改意见一项，就为国家节约钢材五十多吨。
    在这次增产节约运动中，这位节约钢材的能手又给自己确定了新的更高的奋斗目标——一年节约好钢材一百吨。
