Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Government of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement supporting the Soviet government's proposal to safeguard peace and security in the Near and Middle East. The full text is as follows:

On February 11, 1957, the Soviet government proposed to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that they issue a declaration on peace and security in the Near and Middle East, and on the issue of non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in this region. The Soviet government also put forward six basic principles that participating countries should guarantee to abide by in their policy towards the Near and Middle East. The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports this major initiative of the Soviet government.

The situation in the Near and Middle East region has recently become tense again. Although the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel has been stopped, Israel, with the support and connivance of Western countries, still refuses to withdraw all its invading forces from the invaded Egyptian territory in accordance with the repeated resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. In particular, the United States has openly announced the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" plan, attempting to take advantage of the failure of the Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt to replace Britain and France's colonial position in the Near and Middle East and impose new enslavement on the people of the Near and Middle East. At present, the United States is stepping up its sabotage of Arab countries' unity and carrying out conspiracies of internal subversion against certain Arab countries. The sovereignty and interests of Near and Middle Eastern countries, as well as the peace and security of this region, are therefore under new threats. Under these circumstances, all peace-loving countries and peoples have a responsibility to demand that Israel unconditionally withdraw its aggressive troops from Egyptian territory and should actively prevent any aggression and interference against Near and Middle Eastern countries.

Considering that there are still many long-standing and unresolved disputes in the Near and Middle East region, and that the United States has recently created new tensions in this region; considering the wishes and interests of the people of the Near and Middle East countries, and the urgency and importance of maintaining peace and security in the Near and Middle East, the Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Soviet government's proposal of February 11, 1957, is timely and correct. The realization of the Soviet proposal will eliminate external factors that threaten and undermine peace and security in the Near and Middle East, and will guarantee the independence and security of Near and Middle Eastern countries. The realization of the Soviet proposal will undoubtedly also help Near and Middle Eastern countries to move towards economic prosperity through the path of peaceful construction and independent development. Therefore, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have no reason to reject this reasonable proposal of the Soviet government. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will stand together with peace-loving countries and peoples around the world and continue to work to maintain peace and security in the Near and Middle East.

    我国政府发表声明  完全支持苏联维护中近东和平的重大倡议
    新华社17日讯　中华人民共和国政府今天发表关于支持苏联政府维护中近东和平和安全的建议的声明。全文如下：
    1957年2月11日，苏联政府向美、英、法三国政府建议发表关于中近东的和平和安全以及不干涉这个地区国家的内政问题的宣言。苏联政府并且提出了宣言参加国应该在自己对中近东的政策中保证遵守的六项基本原则。中华人民共和国政府完全支持苏联政府这一重大的倡议。
    中近东地区的局势最近正重新趋于紧张。英法和以色列对埃及的武装侵略行动虽然已被制止，但是以色列在西方国家的支持和纵容之下，仍然拒绝按照联合国大会的多次决议把侵略军全部撤出被侵入的埃及领土。特别是美国更公然宣布了所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”计划，企图乘英法侵埃战争失败的机会，来取代英法在中近东的殖民地位，把新的奴役强加在中近东人民的头上。目前，美国正在加紧它破坏阿拉伯国家的团结，并且对某些阿拉伯国家进行内部颠覆的阴谋活动。中近东各国的主权和利益以及这个地区的和平和安全，因而又受到了新的威胁。在这种情况下一切爱好和平的国家和人民，都有责任要求以色列无条件地从埃及领土上撤出它的侵略军队，并且应该积极地制止对中近东国家的任何侵略和干涉。
    考虑到在中近东地区仍然存在着不少长期悬而未决的争执，而且最近美国又在这个地区制造新的紧张局势；考虑到中近东各国人民的愿望和利益，以及维护中近东和平和安全的迫切性和重要性，中华人民共和国政府认为：苏联政府1957年2月11日的建议，是适时的和正确的。苏联建议的实现，将会消除威胁和破坏中近东和平和安全的外来因素，使中近东各国的独立和安全得到保障。苏联建议的实现无疑地也将有助于中近东各国经由和平建设和独立发展的道路走向经济的繁荣。因此，美、英、法三国政府没有任何理由拒绝苏联政府这一合理的建议。中国政府和中国人民将同世界爱好和平的国家和人民在一起，继续为维护中近东的和平和安全而努力。
