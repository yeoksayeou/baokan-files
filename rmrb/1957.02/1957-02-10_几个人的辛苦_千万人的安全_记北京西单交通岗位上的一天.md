	A Few People's Hard Work, Millions of People's Safety
	A Day on the Beijing Xidan Traffic Post
	By Our Correspondent Xia Jingfan

	A Constant Stream of Traffic
	The Place with the Most Traffic Flow in the Capital

	It snowed last night. At four o'clock in the morning, more than 1,400 traffic police officers throughout Beijing appeared on the streets, some sweeping snow, some spreading ash. Before dawn, every intersection and turning point had been cleaned up very neatly.

	The seven traffic police officers at the Xidan post finished cleaning the road surface near the post, and it was exactly six o'clock. Two officers were left to take over: one ascended the traffic light control platform, and the other stood in the middle of the road. The east had just begun to turn white, and the vehicles and pedestrians on the road began to become active. As seven o'clock approached, the east-west road more than 50 feet wide and the north-south road more than 25 feet wide were almost entirely occupied by the flow of vehicles and people.

	The traffic lights automatically changed every 52 seconds. Within these short 52 seconds, the number of bicycles at the four intersections often gathered to more than 500. At a glance, except for buses and trolleybuses, it was almost an ocean of bicycles. This was mainly the commuting of workers and students going to school.

	This intersection is the hub of Beijing's southwest city. It connects Chang'an Avenue to the east, New Beijing to the west, Xuanwumen to the south, and Xisi Archway to the north. There are nine bus stops and five trolleybus lines near the traffic post. There are six cinemas and theaters, and shops are lined up. Not far to the north is the large Xidan Department Store, one of the more concentrated commercial areas in Beijing. The traffic flow here ranks first in Beijing. I remember a year ago, when the east-west road had not yet been widened, I used to ride my bicycle through here every day, almost pushing it through the crowd. At that time, I only heard the traffic police constantly shouting at vehicles and pedestrians. It is said that a traffic police officer once shouted 295 words per hour. Manually directing cars with gestures meant that for up to 55 minutes in an hour, their hands were raised. At that time, there were six intersections pointing to this post, and the traffic police here used the slogan "Eyes watching six roads, ears listening to all directions" to describe and demand their work. Now, the east-west road has been widened more than three times, and the traffic light control platform is equipped with a loudspeaker and an automatic light changer, using a baton instead of gestures. These improvements have greatly reduced the physical labor of the traffic police and made it much more convenient for vehicles and pedestrians. However, the work of the traffic police is still arduous and astonishing.

	Today it snowed a little, and the traffic police were more nervous than usual. The loudspeaker kept shouting:

	"Comrade, the light is red, please wait a moment."

	"Right turn is allowed, left turn is not allowed."

	"Comrades riding bicycles, please go slower."

	"Comrade, don't stop, keep moving."...

	The traffic police standing in the middle of the road were especially busy, turning around and looking straight into the piles of cars and people. If they found someone with poor cycling skills, they immediately told them to get off the bike; if they found someone wearing a wind hood and unable to see both sides, they shouted at them to pay attention; if they found someone disregarding cars and trolleybuses and rushing ahead, they shouted and waved at them to slow down. A bicycle almost collided with a car. The traffic police rushed forward, pulling and hugging, holding the bicycle in their arms to let the car pass, saying, "You must pay attention next time!" while straightening the bike and sending it forward, letting them continue on their way. It seems that the traffic police are very afraid of delaying people's time to go to work and school. This feeling is so compatible with the people rushing in the morning; in one hour from seven to eight o'clock, at least more than 30,000 bicycles pass through. To direct so many vehicles to pass in such a short period of time in a timely manner without causing accidents is such a tense and arduous task!

	At half past eight, the number of bicycles decreased, and streams of cars and transport trucks passed through here in large numbers. The traffic police in the middle of the road kept directing and signaling to allow the cars to pass smoothly. Within an hour, the number of cars passing through was as high as seven or eight hundred at most. Changing the lights every 52 seconds greatly reduced the stopping time for cars, and most cars could keep moving. In this way, not only is travel time saved, but gasoline is also greatly saved: if every car stopped at this intersection for one minute, and 10,000 cars passed through in a day, it would be equivalent to more than 160 cars parked on the road for an hour without moving. And a car stopping and starting also consumes more gasoline. A small car consumes an average of 0.2 jin more fuel for each stop and start, and a large car consumes an average of 0.4 jin more fuel for each stop and start. 10,000 cars (calculated with 6,000 small cars and 4,000 large cars) consume as much as 1,750 jin of gasoline more at this intersection every day! At the same time, a sudden brake reduces the life of the machine parts and tires. It is necessary to calculate this account that people do not pay attention to.

	Helping the Old and Carrying the Young
	Providing Thoughtful Service to Pedestrians

	When the clock points to nine o'clock, the road is slightly calmer. Housewives are carrying baskets towards the vegetable market; people strolling around have also come out; administrative staff from organizations and vehicles carrying goods come one after another. Before long, the road is crowded again. All kinds of vehicles are mixed together. When a mother pushes a stroller past, the traffic police stare straight at other vehicles approaching the stroller, shouting for other vehicles to pay attention to the stroller. It seems that this is a special object of protection for the traffic police.

	Among the pedestrians, the traffic police are most concerned about seeing the elderly, children, pregnant women, and disabled people crossing the road, shouting for cyclists to pay attention and signaling for cars to slow down. Near eleven o'clock, two blind people playing the piano in the Xidan Department Store recreation room came from the south. The traffic police seemed to have mastered the regularity of their passage, ran over to pull their bamboo horses, and sent them across the road. At this time, a four or five-year-old child was crying under the traffic light control platform because he was lost. Another traffic police officer asked about the child's residence and hired a pedicab to send him home. Some people praised the traffic police, saying, "Helping the old and carrying the young, pulling the blind, sending lost children home." This is indeed the case.

	In the midst of busyness, more than a dozen people came to the traffic police to ask for directions in an hour. This is really adding work to the work. For the elderly who ask for directions, they are also helped to the sidewalk. A farmer turned around and wanted to run after asking for directions, but was grabbed by the traffic police, who told him to slow down. Because people asking for directions are usually more careful when approaching the traffic police, once the problem is solved, they are always overjoyed and neglect safety. It seems that the traffic police understand this state of mind very well.

	From half past eleven, students are dismissed from school, and employees are leaving work one after another, and suddenly there is a period of tension like in the morning.

	Investigation and Research
	Mastering the Regularity of Passing Pedestrians and Vehicles

	At four o'clock in the afternoon, when there are fewer vehicles and pedestrians, twelve traffic police officers came to the four intersections at once, each with a notebook in hand. With a command of "Start," they separately counted the passing vehicles and pedestrians one by one. This is something they often do, because an important part of the work of the traffic police is their usual investigation and research. They must master the general rules of passing pedestrians. They also have separate investigations of how many organizations, how many schools, how many people, how many vehicles are near the post, how many children on the street are willing to run around, and how many elderly and disabled people often go out. They must also separately and deeply promote traffic rules and, according to the different seasons, explain the matters that should be paid attention to on the road. Recently, they are focusing on reminding elementary school students not to ice skate on the street in elementary schools. At the same time, they also hold meetings for mothers and children in the collective dormitories and large courtyards of organizations to familiarize them with the rules of the road. The relationship between the traffic police and the drivers of cars and trolleybuses is even closer. They often hold symposiums, and some have become very good friends, often exchanging professional knowledge with each other. The traffic police understand the performance of various cars, especially the turning radius law of various cars.

	They also pay attention to studying the situation of people asking for directions: for example, if someone asking for directions says "Ministry of Higher Education" or "Planning Commission" is located, this person is probably living in Beijing and is more familiar, so just say it simply. If someone asking for directions says very carefully, word by word, "Central Higher Education Department" or "National Planning Commission" is located, this person is probably new to Beijing and needs to be told in detail. If a soldier asks about the Qianmen Railway Station, it can be solved by simply saying "Go south to Tiananmen," because every comrade soldier knows Tiananmen. In short, from the tone and clothing of the person asking for directions, they can identify the identity of the person asking for directions and whether they are new to Beijing.

	How meticulous and intelligent is the work of the traffic police! At five o'clock, the loudspeaker shouted "Stop investigating traffic volume." It was calculated that 563 motor vehicles (cars, trolleybuses, motorcycles) passed through in this hour, 7,631 slow vehicles (bicycles, pedicabs), and more than 11,000 pedestrians.

	After a while, students are dismissed from school, employees are leaving work, and people who come out to stroll and go to entertainment venues come and go like a tide. A large number of bicycles, various cars, and trolleybuses are all mixed together, almost impenetrable. This is much more chaotic than in the morning. The number of traffic police at the four intersections has increased. At six o'clock, the street lights suddenly all lit up. Neon lights are colorful on the street, people come and go, bustling and bustling, a constant stream of traffic, a scene of prosperity. The traffic police shouted for a while: "Comrades riding bicycles, please turn on the lights." In an instant, the road turned into a world of lights. But there are also a few people who ride bicycles without lights. The traffic police did not blame them, but only shouted: "Comrade, your light is off, please turn on the light." With such a shout, whether the car light was really off or not turned on at all, they automatically turned on the light.

	Vehicles and pedestrians squeezed until half past eight, and then slowly became scarce. The work of the traffic police seemed to be a little more leisurely at this time.

	Diligent Results
	No Responsibility Accidents in Eight Years

	The traffic police are on this diligent post, constantly maintaining the safety of vehicles and pedestrians. In the more than eight years since liberation, this traffic post has not had a single responsibility accident. This day has also passed peacefully. (Attached picture)

	"Don't cry, I'll take you to find your mother."

    几个人的辛苦  千万人的安全
    记北京西单交通岗位上的一天	本报记者  夏景凡
    车水马龙
    首都交通流量最大的地方
    夜里下了一场雪。早晨四点钟，全北京市的一千四百多名交通警都出现在街头，扫雪的扫雪，铺灰的铺灰，不到天亮，各个交岔路口和转弯的地方，都已打整得十分清爽。
    西单岗位上的七个交通警，一齐把岗位附近的路面整好后，正好是六点钟。留下两个人接班：一个登上信号灯指挥台，一个站在路中间。东方刚刚发白，马路上的车辆和行人便开始活跃起来。进入七点钟的时候，十五丈多宽的东西马路、八丈多宽的南北马路，几乎全部被车流人流占满了。
    红绿灯每隔五十二秒钟自动变换一次，在这短短的五十二秒钟内，四个路口的自行车常聚到五百辆以上，一眼望去，除公共汽车和电车外，几乎成了自行车的海洋。这主要是职工上班、学生上学的行列。
    这个路口，是北京西南城的枢纽。东连长安街，西通新北京，南对宣武门，北达西四牌楼。交通岗位附近有九个公共汽车站，五条路线的电车站。六个电影院和戏院，商店林立，向北不远还有庞大的西单商场，是北京商业比较集中的地区之一。这里的交通流量居全北京第一位。记得一年以前，东西马路还没有展宽，我每天骑自行车通过这里，差不多都是推着车子挤过去的。那时只听交通警不停地对车辆行人喊话，据说一小时一个交通警曾喊到二百九十五声话。双手打手势指挥汽车，一小时内最多有五十五分钟是举着手的。那时有六个路口指向这个岗位，这里的交通警曾以“眼看六路、耳听八方”的口号，来形容和要求自己的工作。现在，东西马路展宽了三倍以上，信号灯指挥台上装了扩音器和自动变灯器，用指挥棒代替了手势。这些改进大大减轻了交通警的体力劳动同时使车辆行人也方便多了。但是，交通警的工作依然是繁重而又惊人的。
    这一天下过一点雪，交通警比平时更紧张。扩音器里不停地在喊：
    “同志红灯，请你等一等。”
    “右转弯可以走，左转弯不可以走。”
    “骑自行车的同志慢点走。”
    “同志不要站，跟上走。”………
    站在路中间的交通警特别忙碌，转来转去直向车堆人堆里瞧。发现有骑车技术不好的，立刻喊他下车；发现骑车戴风帽看不见两边的，直喊他注意；发现有不顾汽车、电车抢行的，连喊带挥手叫他慢点。一辆自行车几乎要和汽车相撞了，交通警一个箭步跑去连拉带抱，把自行车揽在怀里让汽车过去，一面说“下次要注意啊！”一面扶正车子向前一送，又让他继续走了。看来交通警很怕耽误人们上班和上学时间，这种心情和早晨赶路的人多么相适应啊；七点到八点的一小时，光是自行车至少要过三万辆以上。这样短的时间要指挥这样多的车辆及时地通过而又不发生事故，这是一件多么紧张而又繁重的事啊！
    八点半钟，自行车少下来了，一路路的小汽车和运输卡车又大量地在这里通过。路中间的交通警不停的指挥和示意让汽车顺利开过去。一小时内，通过的汽车，多的时候有七八百辆。五十二秒钟变换一次灯，使汽车大大减少了停车时间，多数的汽车可以不停。这样一来，不仅节约了行车时间，而且大大地节约了汽油：如果让每辆汽车在这个路口停上一分钟，一天过一万辆汽车，就等于一百六十多部汽车排在马路上一小时不动。而汽车一停一起，也多消耗汽油。一辆小汽车一停一起平均多耗二两油，大汽车停起一次，平均多耗四两油，一万辆汽车（以小车六千大车四千来计算），每天在这个路口多耗的汽油竟达一千七百五十斤！同时，猛刹一次车，机件和轮胎都要减少寿命。这笔不为人们注意的账，算算该是必要的。
    扶老携幼
    周到地为行人服务
    时针指向九点钟的时候，马路上稍稍较为平静一些。主妇们提着篮子走向菜市场；游逛的人也出来了；机关的管理员和拉货的车辆接踵而来。不一会，马路上又显得拥挤了。各式车辆杂在一起。当妈妈推着小孩车走过来的时候，交通警直盯着走近小孩车的其他车辆，喊叫其他车辆注意小孩车。好像这是交通警特别保护的对象。
    在行人中，看到老人、孩子、孕妇和残废人过马路的时候，交通警最为关心，直喊骑自行车的注意，对汽车也示意慢行。近十一点钟，在西单商场游艺室操琴的两个瞎子从南边过来，交通警像是掌握了他们经过的规律，跑过去拉上他们的竹马，送过马路。这时，信号灯指挥台下面有一个四五岁的小孩因迷路在啼哭，另一个交通警问清了孩子的住处，便雇了一辆三轮车，送他回家。有人称颂交通警说：“扶老携幼拉盲人，迷路小孩送回家。”的确是这样的。
    在繁忙中，一小时内，又有十多个人走到交通警跟前问路。这真是忙上加忙。对于问路的老人，还把他扶送到人行道上。有一个农民问完路回头想跑，被交通警一把拉住，告诉他慢点走。因为问路的人走向交通警时都比较小心，一旦解决了问题，总是喜不自禁，忽视安全。这种心理状态，看来交通警是很了解的。
    十一点半钟起，学生放学了，职工陆续下班了，突然又像早晨似的紧张了一阵。
    调查研究
    掌握过往行人车辆的规律
    午后四点钟，车辆行人比较少的时候，四个路口一下来了十二个交通警，每人手上拿着记录本，一声“开始”的口令，他们便分别地一一数着过往的车辆和行人。这是他们经常要做的事情，因为交通警的工作重要的还在于他们平时的调查研究。他们要掌握过往行人的一般规律。对于岗位附近有几个机关，几个学校，多少人，多少车，街道上有多少肯在马路上跑的孩子，多少常外出的老人和残废人，也都有分别的调查。还要分别地深入地去宣传交通规则和根据时令的不同，来讲解马路上应注意的事项。最近他们正着重在小学校里关照小学生不要在街上滑冰。同时还到机关的集体宿舍和大杂院里召开妈妈和孩子们的会，让他们熟悉马路上的规矩。交通警与汽车、电车司机的关系更加密切，他们经常开座谈会，有的已结为很好的朋友，彼此经常交换业务知识。交通警对各种汽车的性能特别是各种汽车转弯的半径律，都是了解的。
    对于问路人的情况，他们也很注意研究：比如问路人说“高教部”或“计委会”在哪里，这人多半是住在北京而且较熟，只简单说一下就行。如果问路人很仔细地一字一字地说“中央高等教育部”或“国家计划委员会”在哪里，这人多半是初来北京，就需要详细地告诉他。如果是军人问前门火车站，只说“到天安门往南走”一句话就解决了，因为军人同志谁都知道天安门。总之，从问路人的口气和衣着上，他们都能辨明问路人的身份和是否初来北京。
    交通警的工作是多么细致和聪明啊！五点整，扩音器里喊了一声“调查交通量的停止”。算了算，这一小时内机动车（汽车、电车、摩托车）过了五百六十三辆，慢车（自行车、三轮车）过了七千六百三十一辆，行人一万一千多。
    隔了一会，学生放学了，职工下班了，出来游逛和走向娱乐场所的人们，像潮水一样来往着。大量的自行车、各式汽车和电车都混在一起，几乎是水泄不通。这比早上的情况杂乱多了。四个路口都增加了交通警。六点钟，路灯突然全亮了。霓虹灯满街缤纷，人来人往，熙熙攘攘，车水马龙，一片繁盛景象。交通警喊了一阵：“骑自行车的同志，请把灯打开。”霎时，马路上变成了灯的世界。但也有极个别骑自行车不点灯的人。交通警未加责怪，只喊着：“同志你的灯灭了，请把灯点上吧。”这样的喊话，不管那车灯是否真灭或根本未点，都自动地把灯点上了。
    车辆行人一直挤到八点半钟，才慢慢稀少下来。交通警的工作，这时才显得清闲一些。
    辛勤结果
    八年来未发生责任事故
    交通警就在这个辛勤的岗位上，时刻维护着车辆行人的安全。解放后八年多来，这个交通岗位没有发生过一次责任事故。这一天又是平安地过去了。（附图片）
    “别哭了，带你去找妈妈。”
