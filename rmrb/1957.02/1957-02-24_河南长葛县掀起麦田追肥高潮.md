Henan, Changge County, sets off a high tide of wheat field topdressing
(Our dispatch) A vigorous wheat field topdressing campaign has rapidly unfolded in Changge County, Henan Province. Out of a total of 716,000 mu of wheat in the county, 395,106 mu had been topdressed by February 15, accounting for 55.18% of the county's wheat area.
    The topdressing campaign in this county was launched on the basis of Party rectification and publicity about the superiority of cooperation. Initially, the masses lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of wheat topdressing in promoting wheat yield increase. To this end, the county Party committee held an enlarged cadre meeting, analyzed the great significance and favorable conditions for striving for a bumper wheat harvest, and improved the understanding of cadres through calculation methods. If wheat field management is strengthened now, topdressing is applied once, harrowing and hoeing are done once after thawing, and watering is done twice, each mu of wheat will increase production by 20 jin, and the county can increase production by more than 14 million jin. A call was also issued to the masses of the county: strive to achieve a bumper wheat county, and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest throughout the year, requiring that all wheat land should be universally topdressed once by the end of February. Subsequently, agricultural cooperatives resolved the concerns of the masses by checking existing fertilizers, calculating usage, and finding ways to accumulate fertilizer, and the topdressing campaign quickly unfolded. For example, the four cooperatives in Yangzhai Township have 67,000 cartloads of fertilizer and 99,000 jin of fine fertilizer. Based on three cartloads of topdressing per mu, 65,250 cartloads of fertilizer are needed. The existing fertilizer can guarantee the use of wheat field topdressing; 7,530 mu of large autumn land, calculated at five cartloads of base fertilizer per mu, requires 37,650 cartloads of fertilizer. From now on, as long as we seize the time and use various fertilizer sources, such as exchanging room soil, digging house land, digging chicken nests, and digging toilets, we can accumulate 71,000 cartloads of fertilizer, which can guarantee the solution of the problem of applying base fertilizer to large autumn land.
    In the wheat topdressing campaign, cadres and the masses worked together. Li Yuxian, deputy secretary of the county Party committee, dug manure in the manure pit with the masses in Shuangmiao Li Township, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. Many members of agricultural cooperatives are constantly delivering manure for topdressing in snowy weather and in the middle of the night.

    河南长葛县掀起麦田追肥高潮
    本报讯　热火朝天的麦田追肥运动在河南长葛县迅速展开。全县共七十一万六千亩小麦，到2月15日为止，已施追肥三十九万五千一百零六亩，占全县麦地面积55.18％。
    这个县的追肥运动是在整党整社和宣传合作化优越性的基础上开展起来的。开始群众对小麦追肥，促进小麦增产的重要意义认识不足。为此，县委召开了扩大干部会议，分析了争取小麦丰收的重大意义和有利条件，通过查算办法，提高干部认识。如果现在加强麦田管理，追肥一次，开冻后耙一遍、锄一遍，再浇上两次水，每亩麦以增产二十斤计算，全县就可增产一千四百多万斤。并向全县群众发出号召：争取实现小麦丰产县，力争全年农业大丰收，要求2月底争取全部麦地普遍施追肥一次。接着各农业社通过查现有肥料、算用量、找积肥门路等办法，解除了群众顾虑，追肥运动迅速展开。如杨寨乡四个社现有肥料六万七千车，细肥九万九千斤，以每亩追肥三车计算，需肥六万五千二百五十车，现有肥料可保证麦地追肥用；大秋地七千五百三十亩，每亩按五车底肥计算，需肥三万七千六百五十车，从现在起，只要抓紧时间，利用各种肥源，比如换房土、挖屋地、挖鸡洞、挖厕所等，算起来，就可积肥七万一千车，可以保证解决大秋地施底肥问题。
    在小麦追肥运动中，干部与群众共同劳动。县委副书记李玉宪在双庙李乡和群众一块在粪坑内挖粪，这对群众生产热情有很大鼓舞。许多农业社的社员们在下雪天，在半夜里，都在不停地送粪追肥。
