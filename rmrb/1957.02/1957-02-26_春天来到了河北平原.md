Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, February 25th: Xinhua News Agency reporters stationed in various parts of Hebei Province report: On the morning of February 24th, a warm wind carrying dense fog from the sea landed on the coast of Bohai Bay, and rain and snow fell intermittently. Delightful spring has arrived on the vast Hebei Plain.

In the early spring fields of southern Hebei, the earth is recovering, and wheat seedlings are turning green. Fields are filled with people preparing the land and delivering manure. On this day, over 40,000 male and female members from agricultural cooperatives in Handan County, along with more than 8,000 head of livestock and over 2,000 carts, were harrowing the land and delivering manure. In Nanwenzhuang Village's Jinsha Agricultural Cooperative, all 330 full and part-time laborers, over 200 head of livestock, and 30 carts were working in the fields. Cooperative Director Wan Guitang also went to the fields to help Xu Tianshun, the leader of the tenth production team, re-plan the cultivation and irrigation areas based on the terrain of the cultivated land. Additionally, over 400 female cooperative members were selecting seeds at home. In the cooperative office, members of the management committee were discussing revisions to this year's planting plan based on the higher authorities' requirements to appropriately expand the planting area of grain crops and reduce the planting area of cash crops. They decided to appropriately expand the planting area of grain crops and further improve cotton planting techniques to increase the yield per unit area of cotton fields, ensuring the supply of raw cotton to the state.

Preparations for spring plowing are also underway in the central Hebei Plain. Over 2,000 tractors from dozens of tractor stations have been overhauled and have recently begun plowing. Although it was a Sunday, six tractor drivers from the Jin County tractor station still rolled over 1,200 mu of land for the agricultural cooperatives. To support the agricultural cooperatives in striving for a bumper harvest, this tractor station will cultivate 150,000 mu (times) during the spring plowing season. Members of thousands of agricultural cooperatives on the plain have also launched a manure delivery competition, continuing to prepare for spring plowing. In Jin County alone, over 80% of the labor force from more than 180 agricultural cooperatives participated in activities such as delivering manure and harrowing the land.

In the low-lying areas near Bohai Bay, projects to reinforce dikes and transform low-lying land have already begun ahead of schedule, and early-maturing crops have also begun to be sown. Due to the arrival of the ice run in the upper reaches of the Ziya River, 800 young and strong men from the right bank of the Ziya River in Jinghai County went to the dike on the 23rd. They dug ice and drained water in the knee-deep river while digging earth to repair the dike. By the 24th, they had dug over 5,000 cubic meters of earth, reinforcing over 1,000 meters of the dike surface, reducing the threat of flooding. On the 24th, over 600 laborers in the Lianhua Dadian depression in Jinghai County were dredging canals, repairing dike surfaces, and transforming low-lying land. In Wang Erzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, which suffered severe flooding last year, over 300 members delivered manure to the depression early in the morning and sowed spring wheat after the ground thawed at noon. By the 24th, this cooperative had sown over 1,300 mu of spring wheat, reaching 80% of the original plan. These spring wheat crops, plus other early-maturing crops planned to be sown, can avoid or mitigate the threat of rainy season floods. It is estimated that more than 200,000 jin of grain can be produced during the summer harvest. On this day, the cooperative also allocated over 130 laborers to weave mats and make shoes to earn funds and buy food for spring plowing.

In the mountainous areas stretching over 1,000 li along the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains, reservoirs and check dams are being built everywhere, and trees are being planted to protect crops, control soil erosion, and reduce flooding in the plains. Over 800 soil and water conservation projects in the mountainous area of Xingtang County in western Hebei have generally commenced, with over 20,000 people participating in the construction. On this day, twenty-one check dams and over one hundred terraced field stone weir projects in the seven townships of Koutou District also commenced. These projects, once completed, can expand the cultivated land by over 100 mu. As the winter snow melted, flocks of sheep from many agricultural cooperatives were driven up the hillsides. Early this morning, the shepherd of the Lianglingkou Township Agricultural Cooperative bred another sixty ewes. So far, all six hundred ewes in this cooperative have been bred.

On this day, tens of thousands of county and district cadres in Hebei Province went to the fields to lead the agricultural cooperative members in delivering manure and preparing for spring plowing. The Secretary of the CPC Koutou District Committee in Xingtang County, Yi Qing, led the cadres stationed in the office, carrying manure baskets and shoulder poles, to help the agricultural cooperatives deliver manure and carry stones to repair cotton fields early in the morning. Wang Hongbin, a member of the CPC Handan County Committee, also went deep into the Jinsha Agricultural Cooperative to discuss with the members how to replant early-maturing and flood-resistant crops in the low-lying land that was flooded last year, helping them find ways to increase grain production. When the ice run in the Ziya River arrived, Zhang Mingyang, Deputy County Chief of Jinghai County, and other county and district cadres immediately rushed to the dike to direct the dike repair. Some of them even waded through the icy water to lead the farmers in breaking ice and draining water to protect the wheat fields and cultivated land near the river滩.

    春天来到了河北平原
    新华社保定25日电　新华社驻河北省各地记者报道：2月24日清晨，暖风挟着海面上的浓雾从渤海湾登岸，天空断续下着雨雪。喜人的春天已经来到了河北大平原。
    早春的冀南原野上，大地复苏，麦苗返青。田野里到处是整地送粪的人群。这一天，邯郸县各农业社有四万多名男女社员，带着八千多头耕畜和两千多辆大车耙地送粪。南文庄村金沙农业社的三百三十名整、半劳动力，两百多头牲畜，三十辆大车，全部下了地。社主任万桂堂也到地里，帮助第十生产队队长徐天顺根据耕地的地势重新规划耕作灌溉区。另外，这个社还有四百多名女社员在家里挑选种子。在社办公室里，管理委员会的委员们正在根据上级适当扩大粮食作物种植面积、缩小经济作物种植面积的要求，讨论重新修订今年的种植计划。他们决定把粮食作物的种植面积适当扩大，并且要进一步改进植棉技术，提高棉田的单位面积产量，保证对国家的原棉供应。
    冀中平原上的备耕活动也在紧张地进行着。几十个拖拉机站的两千多台拖拉机早已检修好，最近陆续出车耕作了。这一天虽然是星期日，晋县拖拉机站的六名拖拉机手仍给农业社镇压了一千二百亩田地。为支持农业社争取农业大丰收，这个拖拉机站在春耕季节中将耕作十五万亩（次）。平原上数千个农业社的社员们也掀起送粪竞赛，继续为春耕生产作准备。单是晋县的一百八十多个农业社，就有80％以上的劳动力参加了送粪耙地等活动。
    在靠近渤海湾的低洼地区，加固堤防、改造洼地的工程已经提前动工，早熟作物也已经开始播种。由于子牙河上游凌汛的到来，静海县子牙河右岸已经有八百多名年轻力壮的小伙子在23日上堤。他们一边在没膝的河里打冰疏水，一边挖土修堤。到24日，他们已经挖了五千多土方，加固了一千多公尺长的堤面，水灾的威胁减轻了。24日这一天，静海县莲花淀洼里有六百多名劳动力在疏浚渠道，修补堤面，改造洼地。去年遭受严重水灾的王二庄农业社，三百多名社员清早把粪送到洼地里，中午趁地面化冻以后播种春小麦。到24日，这个社已经播种春小麦一千三百多亩，达到原定计划的80％。这些春小麦加上计划播种的其它早熟作物，可以避免或减轻雨季洪水的威胁，预计夏收的时候能够产二十多万斤粮食。这一天，这个社还抽出一百三十多个劳动力编席、做鞋，为春耕生产挣资金和买口粮。
    太行山东麓绵延一千多里的山区，到处都在修建水库、谷坊，种植树木，以保护庄稼，控制水土流失，减轻平原地区的水灾。冀西行唐县山区的八百多处水土保持工程已经普遍动工，参加施工的共两万多人。口头区七个乡的二十一道谷坊和一百多道梯田的石堰工程，这一天都动工了。这些工程完成以后，可以扩大一百多亩耕地。冬雪融化了，许多农业社的羊群都被赶上了山坡。这一天早晨，两岭口乡农业社的牧羊员又给六十多只母羊配了种。至此，这个社的六百多只母羊全都配了种。
    这一天，河北省有几万名县、区干部到田野里领导农业社社员送粪备耕。行唐县口头区的中共区委书记一清早就带领驻机关的干部，背着粪筐，带上扁担，帮助农业社送粪和抬石头修棉田。中共邯郸县委员会委员王鸿彬也深入到金沙农业社，同社员们座谈去年被涝的洼地今年怎样改种早熟和耐涝作物，帮助他们想办法增产粮食。静海县副县长张铭扬和其他县、区干部也在子牙河凌汛到来的时候，立即赶到堤上指挥修堤。他们有的还趟着冰水，领导农民打冰疏水，保护河滩附近的麦田和耕地。
