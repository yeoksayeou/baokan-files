Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th: This reporter, Gao Liang, reports from Gangtok, Sikkim: The Dalai Lama said on the 6th that he would return to Tibet as soon as the snow on the road from Gangtok to Tibet was cleared. And that time will not be long.

The Dalai Lama received the Xinhua News Agency reporter in a room on the third floor of a monastery in the Sikkim Maharaja's Royal Garden. After traveling in India for two months, he appeared to be in good health and in good spirits. The Dalai Lama told the reporter: "No matter where a person goes, he will always miss his motherland. In the past two months, I have been abroad, but my heart has been on the Tibetan plateau."

The Dalai Lama and his entourage were visiting Gangtok at the invitation of the Sikkim Maharaja. According to the original plan, the visit to Sikkim would end on February 4. But the guests encountered the worst weather seen in many years. Heavy snow blocked the road from Gangtok to Tibet.

Several hundred laborers are now clearing the snow on the road. More than two hundred mules carrying the Dalai Lama's luggage have already passed through the Kora-i-Pina-dora Pass and arrived in Tibet. Soon, people will be able to pass through this place. During these five days of rain and snow, the Dalai Lama has been praying for good weather and good roads, so that he and his entourage can return to Tibet as soon as possible.

    大雪阻塞从刚渡到西藏的道路
    达赖喇嘛祈求好天气以便早日回国
    据新华社新德里7日电　本社记者高梁从锡金的刚渡报道：达赖喇嘛6日说，等到刚渡到西藏的路上的积雪一扫除，他马上就回西藏。而这时间是不会久的。
    达赖喇嘛在锡金大君的御花园内一个寺院的三层楼上房间里接见了新华社记者。他在印度作了两个月的旅行之后，看来很健康，而且心情愉快。达赖喇嘛对记者说：“一个人无论到那里去，总是会怀念祖国的。在过去两个月中，我身在国外，但是心在西藏高原。”
    达赖喇嘛和他的随行人员是应锡金大君的邀请到刚渡访问的。根据原来计划，对锡金的访问，在2月4日结束。但是客人们在那里碰到了过去许多年来所未见过的非常恶劣的天气。大雪阻塞了从刚渡到西藏去的道路。
    现在有几百名劳工正在扫除路上的积雪。载着达赖喇嘛一行人的行李的二百多匹骡子已经走过克拉伊皮纳都拉山隘到达西藏了。不久以后，人就可以通过这个地方。在这雨雪交加的五天中，达赖喇嘛总是祈求好天气，祈求道路好走，使他和他的随行人员得以早日回西藏。
