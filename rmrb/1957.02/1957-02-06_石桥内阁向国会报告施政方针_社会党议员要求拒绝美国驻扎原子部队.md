Xinhua News Agency, February 4th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Ishibashi Cabinet, which was formed at the end of last year, formally reported its policy address to the Japanese Diet today.

    Nobusuke Kishi first delivered a speech in his capacity as acting Prime Minister. Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi is in convalescence due to illness.

    Nobusuke Kishi said that the foundation of Japanese foreign policy is active cooperation with "democratic countries" and strengthening understanding and cooperation with the United States. At the same time, the Ishibashi government also hopes to resolve the issue of war reparations with Asian countries and strengthen economic and cultural ties to enhance friendly relations with them. He particularly emphasized the importance of Japan pursuing "economic diplomacy."

    Nobusuke Kishi then delivered a foreign policy speech in his capacity as Foreign Minister.

    Referring to relations with China, Nobusuke Kishi said that Japan has had close relations with mainland China since ancient times, especially in terms of economic interdependence. Therefore, the Japanese government wants to maintain coordination with "free countries" on the one hand, and try to "rationalize" embargo restrictions on the other, expanding trade as much as possible without affecting the aforementioned coordination. He also said that regarding issues other than trade, because there are various complex issues in international politics, the Japanese government believes that careful research is still needed.

    The Japanese Foreign Minister then spoke about some outstanding issues that still need to be resolved after the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. He also announced that Japan is already negotiating the restoration of diplomatic relations with Poland and Czechoslovakia, and it is estimated that an agreement may be reached soon.

    The chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, raised questions at the Diet session that day. He pointed out that following the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with China. Therefore, Japan must take measures to expand trade with China, conduct cultural exchanges, and other measures.

    Suzuki criticized the Ishibashi Cabinet for wanting to continue pursuing a diplomacy enslaved by the United States. He also demanded that the Japanese government oppose the US stationing atomic forces in Japan and Okinawa, and abolish unequal treaties.

    Suzuki demanded the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of new general elections.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 5th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Diet members today questioned the Ishibashi Cabinet's policy address. The questioning focused on issues such as Japan-China relations and Japan's breaking away from US control to implement a peaceful and independent policy.

    Socialist Party Councilor Minoru Habu pointed out that the Japanese government should promote the restoration of diplomatic relations with China. He believes that the stationing of US atomic forces in Japan should be rejected. In the House of Representatives, Socialist Party member Mitsu Kono also expressed concern about the news that the United States wants to station atomic forces in Japan.

    Socialist Party members once again demanded the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of new general elections to solicit public opinion. This request was immediately rejected by acting Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi.

    Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi said in response to questioning that it is not yet the stage to restore diplomatic relations with China. He also said that regarding the issue of easing the embargo, Japan will continue to work hard to engage with the United States and other "free countries" in the future.

    Nobusuke Kishi said that Japan sincerely hopes that a nuclear war will not occur. When specifically addressing the issue of the US atomic forces being dispatched to Japan, Nobusuke Kishi said on the one hand that the Japanese government intends to make a firm decision in accordance with the Japanese people's opposition to atomic weapons and Japan's own independent ideas; on the other hand, he said that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received any notification from the United States about the transfer of atomic forces, at which point Socialist Party members shouted in dissatisfaction: "Don't lie!"

    石桥内阁向国会报告施政方针
    社会党议员要求拒绝美国驻扎原子部队
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：去年年底成立的石桥内阁今天正式向日本国会报告它的施政方针。
    岸信介首先以临时代理首相的身份发表演说。首相石桥湛山因病在疗养中。
    岸信介说，日本外交政策的基础是同“民主国家”积极合作和加强同美国的了解和合作。同时，石桥政府也希望解决同亚洲国家的战争赔偿问题，加强经济和文化联系，以增进同它们的友好关系。他特别强调日本推行“经济外交”的重要性。
    岸信介随后又以外务相身份发表了外交演说。
    在谈到同中国的关系时，岸信介说，日本自古以来同中国大陆有着密切的关系，特别是在经济上有着互相依靠的关系。因此，日本政府想一方面同“自由国家”保持协调，另一方面要设法使禁运限制“合理化”，在不影响上述协调的范围以内尽量扩大贸易。他又说，关于贸易以外的问题，因为在国际政治上存在着各种复杂的问题，所以日本政府认为还要慎重地进行研究。
    日本外务相接着谈到了日苏邦交正常化以后还有待解决的一些悬案。他还宣布，日本已经在同波兰和捷克斯洛伐克谈判恢复邦交问题，估计可能在最近达成协议。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在当天的国会会议中提出质询。他指出，继日苏恢复邦交而来的是同中国恢复邦交问题。因此，日本必须采取同中国扩大贸易、进行文化交流和其他措施。
    铃木抨击石桥内阁还想继续推行受美国奴役的外交。他并且要求日本政府反对美国把原子部队驻扎在日本和冲绳，并且要废除不平等条约。
    铃木要求解散国会，重新举行大选。
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本国会议员今天对石桥内阁的施政方针进行质询。质询集中在日中关系和日本摆脱美国控制以执行和平独立政策等问题方面。
    社会党参议员羽生三七指出，日本政府应当促进同中国恢复邦交。他认为应该拒绝美国原子部队驻扎在日本。在众议院，社会党议员河野密也对美国要在日本驻扎原子部队的消息表示关心。
    社会党议员再次要求解散国会，重新举行大选以征求民意。这个要求随即被代首相岸信介拒绝了。
    代理首相、外务相岸信介在答复质询时说，关于同中国的关系，现在还不到恢复邦交的阶段。他又说，关于放宽禁运问题，日本今后还将努力向美国和其他“自由国家”进行活动。
    岸信介说，日本衷心希望不发生原子战争。在具体谈到美国原子部队派驻日本的问题时，岸信介一面说，日本政府打算坚决按照日本国民的反对原子武器的想法和日本的自主的想法来加以决定；另一方面又说，日本外务省并没有接到美国调动原子部队的通知，这时，社会党议员们不满地高喊：“不要撒谎”。
