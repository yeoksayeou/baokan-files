Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 23rd: "Al Masaa" commented on February 22nd on Eisenhower's speech on the issue of Israeli troop withdrawal, saying: "We are currently facing a series of conspiracies hidden in sweet words, and we should be vigilant."

The newspaper accused Eisenhower of guaranteeing to meet "all the demands" made by Israel regarding "free passage" through the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba, as well as the "internationalization" of the Gaza Strip. It said: "Isn't all this exactly the benefits and privileges that Israel would have obtained if its aggression had succeeded? Did Israel possess all these rights before launching the aggression? The US President has expressed his opinion on the issues of free navigation through the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba, as well as the Gaza Strip, but has not expressed any opinion on resolving the refugee problem, which is surprising."

The newspaper pointed out that because the United States has promised Israel its demands, Israel has been encouraged to continue to adopt a stubborn attitude and refuse to withdraw from the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip.

"Al Akhbar" said on February 22nd that Eisenhower's proposal for handling the situation after Israel's withdrawal was "objectionable." The newspaper pointed out that Eisenhower was very enthusiastic about Israel's right to free passage through the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba, as well as Israel's demand for the internationalization of the Gaza Strip. It said that giving Israel such guarantees is tantamount to rewarding its aggression.

"Al Ahram" also criticized Eisenhower for promising Israel's demands, but expressed support for his demand that Israel withdraw its troops immediately.

"Al Gomhouria" editor-in-chief Sadat expressed welcome to Eisenhower's speech in a commentary published in the newspaper, believing that it was "Eisenhower upholding his principles regardless of his feelings for his friends."

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, Washington dispatch: Eisenhower and Dulles held another meeting on February 22nd regarding Israel's refusal to withdraw troops from Egypt. After the meeting, the White House issued a statement saying that the United States would further discuss the matter with Israel, and that the United States would wait until Dulles and Israeli Ambassador Eban had another meeting before the United States could express its attitude to the United Nations regarding Israel's refusal to withdraw troops.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, Paris dispatch: The French Foreign Ministry announced on February 22nd that France opposes the withdrawal of troops before Israel receives "appropriate guarantees for its future security."

After Eisenhower's speech on the issue of Israeli troop withdrawal, the French government has not yet formally expressed its attitude towards the speech. Sources say that officials privately expressed dissatisfaction with the US approach. It is said that the right-wing group is exerting great pressure on the Mollet government to reiterate France's support for Israel.

    埃报指出美国的鼓励使以色列顽固不驯
    但有些报纸受到艾森豪威尔花言巧语的迷惑
    美国要同以色列继续谈判　法国支持以色列拖延撤军
    据新华社开罗23日电　“晚报”22日就艾森豪威尔关于以色列撤军问题的演说发表评论说：“我们目前面临着一系列的包藏在花言巧语里面的阴谋，我们应该警惕。”
    这家报纸指责艾森豪威尔保证要满足以色列在“自由通过”苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾以及加沙地带“国际化”方面“所提出的一切要求”。它说：“这一切难道不正是以色列如果侵略得逞就会获得的利益和特权吗？以色列在发动侵略以前是不是拥有这一切权利呢？美国总统就自由通航苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾问题以及加沙地带问题表明了自己的意见，但是根本没有在解决难民问题这一方面发表意见，这是令人感到奇怪的。”
    这家报纸指出，由于美国许诺了以色列的要求，以色列已经受到鼓励，因而继续采取顽固态度，拒绝撤出亚喀巴湾和加沙地带。
    “消息报”22日说，艾森豪威尔演说中关于以色列撤军以后的处理办法的建议是“应加反对的”。这家报纸指出，艾森豪威尔对于以色列船只自由通过苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾的权利以及以色列关于加沙地带国际化的要求很热心。它说，给予以色列这样的保证等于对它的侵略付以酬劳。
    “金字塔报”也抨击了艾森豪威尔许诺以色列的要求，但是对于他要求以色列立即撤军这一点表示支持。
    “共和国报”主编萨达特在这家报纸上发表的评论中对艾森豪威尔的演说表示欢迎，他认为这是“艾森豪威尔维护他的原则而不顾他对他的朋友的感情”。
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯22日又就以色列拒绝从埃及撤军问题举行会谈。会谈后，白宫发表声明说，美国还要同以色列进一步商谈，美国要等到杜勒斯和以色列大使伊班再进行会谈后，才能够向联合国表明美国对以色列拒绝撤军问题的态度。
    据新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部在22日宣布，法国反对在以色列得到关于它“今后安全的适当保证”以前就撤军。
    艾森豪威尔关于以色列撤兵问题的演说发表之后，法国政府还没有对这篇演说正式表明态度。消息说，官方人士私下对美国的作法表示不满。据说，右翼集团对摩勒政府施加很大的压力，要他重申法国支持以色列。
