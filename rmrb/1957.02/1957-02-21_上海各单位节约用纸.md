    Shanghai Units Economize on Paper Use
    (Our dispatch) Shanghai's factories, enterprises, and government offices have begun to pay attention to economizing on paper in various aspects, and have achieved significant results.
    There are many ways to economize on paper. The industrial sector saves a lot of paper by improving and simplifying packaging. The Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau and the underwear factories under the Underwear Industry Company originally used a sheet of four-opening kraft paper to pack only half a dozen underwear, but now they pack a dozen. In addition, they have eliminated oil-proof paper lining the boxes and thin paper lining, which can save paper worth 220,000 yuan annually. The kraft paper item alone can save more than 1,200 reams. If the Hygiene Mask produced by each factory under the Medical Equipment Industry Company changes the packaging of each mask from flat packaging to folded packaging, it can save 585 reams of glazed paper annually. The packaging of enamel products has always been the most paper-intensive. Recently, the Enamel Professional Company decided to promote the method of packaging every other item throughout the industry, which can save more than 2,800 reams of glazed paper annually.
    Government offices and organizations have carefully calculated and improved the utilization rate of paper, which has also saved a lot of paper. The Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China has increased the number of copies of many reports and documents; originally 24-opening ones were changed to 36-opening ones, or the blank paper on the four sides and content was reduced, and it is estimated that more than 270 reams of office paper can be saved. The unified invoices printed by the Shanghai Department Store Trade Association only need to be changed from three-part forms to two-part forms, which can reduce the original paper consumption from 136 reams to 89 reams.
    Due to the attention of enterprises, government offices, and organizations to economizing on paper, the supply of paper on the market is now better than in the previous period.

    上海各单位节约用纸
    本报讯　上海市各工厂、企业、机关已开始从各个方面注意节约用纸，并获得显著成效。
    节约用纸的方法是多方面的，工业部门从改进和简化包装着手节约了许多纸张。上海市纺织工业管理局、内衣工业公司所属各内衣厂生产的汗衫，原来一张四开的牛皮纸只能包半打内衣，现改包一打，另外又取消防油纸衬箱，薄页纸里衬，全年可节约价值二十二万元纸张，仅牛皮纸一项就可节约一千二百多令。医疗器材工业公司所属各厂生产的卫生口罩，如果将每只口罩的包装，由平摊包改为对折包后，全年可节约有光纸五百八十五令。搪瓷用品的包装历来是用纸最费的地方，最近搪瓷专业公司决定在全业中推行隔只包装的方法，全年就可以节约有光纸两千八百多令。
    机关、团体精打细算，提高纸张的利用率也节省了大量的纸张。中国人民银行上海市分行将许多报表、单据的开数提高了；原来二十四开的改为三十六开，或者是缩小四边和内容空白纸，估计就可节约办公用纸二百七十余令。上海市百货业同业公会印制的统一发票，只需要三联单改为二联单就可将原来的用纸量从一百三十六令压缩到八十九令。
    由于各企业、机关、团体注意节约用纸，目前市场纸张的供应情况比前一个时期有所好转。
