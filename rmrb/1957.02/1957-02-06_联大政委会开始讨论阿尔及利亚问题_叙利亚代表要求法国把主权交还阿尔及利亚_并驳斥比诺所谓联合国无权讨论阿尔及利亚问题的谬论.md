Xinhua News Agency, 5th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee began discussing the Algerian question on the 4th. This issue was placed on the agenda at the request of fifteen Asian and African countries. In a memorandum to the United Nations, these countries pointed out that the United Nations' hope for restoring peace in Algeria had not been realized in the past year, and France not only failed to implement a policy of reconciliation, but continued to implement large-scale military suppression measures.

At the meeting on the 4th, French Foreign Minister Pinay spoke first, reiterating the French government's attitude: "We did not recognize in the past, we do not recognize now, and we will never recognize in the future that the United Nations is qualified to deal with issues that we believe, according to international law, belong to France's internal affairs," "France can in no way accept the votes of the Political Committee and the United Nations General Assembly on recommendations regarding the Algerian question."

After Pinay spoke, Syrian representative Zeineddine spoke next. He pointed out that the Algerian question is an international issue and not France's internal affair, and France's denial of the United Nations' functions is an insult to the United Nations.

Zeineddine pointed out that Algerians have been fighting for the re-establishment of their independence for the 126 years of French occupation, and this fact alone negates France's claim that Algeria is a vast wasteland without sovereign rule.

Zeineddine emphasized the Arab world's solidarity on the Algerian question, and pointed out that France's demands on Algeria cannot be recognized. Zeineddine said: What we hope for now is that France recognizes that sovereignty should be gradually returned to Algeria with the help of the United Nations. He said that this can maintain cooperation between Algeria and France in accordance with the free will of the Algerian people.

Zeineddine also recounted the Bandung Conference's statement on the Algerian question, and pointed out that the Algerian people have the support of the vast majority of mankind.

Zeineddine finally said that colonialism still exists, and the General Assembly is facing three colonial issues: Algeria, Cyprus and West Irian. He said that colonialism is a disease that afflicts mankind. He also accused France of having the lowest prestige in modern history due to the situation in Algeria.

After Zeineddine spoke, the committee announced a recess. The next meeting will continue on the 5th.

    联大政委会开始讨论阿尔及利亚问题
    叙利亚代表要求法国把主权交还阿尔及利亚
    并驳斥比诺所谓联合国无权讨论阿尔及利亚问题的谬论
    据新华社5日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会4日开始讨论阿尔及利亚问题。这个问题是应十五个亚非国家的请求而列入议程的。这些国家在给联合国的备忘录里指出，在过去一年中，联合国对恢复阿尔及利亚的和平的期望并没有实现，法国不仅不执行和解政策，反而继续施行大规模的军事镇压手段。
    在4日会议上，法国外交部长比诺首先发言，他重申法国政府的态度说：“我们过去不承认，现在不承认，将来也永远不承认联合国有资格处理我们根据国际法的观点认为属于法国内政的问题”，“法国无论如何不能接受政治委员会和联合国大会就关于阿尔及利亚问题的建议所进行的表决。”
    在比诺发言后，叙利亚代表宰尼丁接着发言。他指出，阿尔及利亚问题是一个国际问题而不是法国的内政问题，法国否认联合国的职能是对联合国的侮辱。
    宰尼丁指出，阿尔及利亚人在法国占领的一百二十六年来一直在为重新获得他们的独立而战斗，单单这个事实就否定了法国所说的阿尔及利亚是没有主权统治的一大片荒地的说法。
    宰尼丁强调阿拉伯世界在阿尔及利亚问题上的团结一致，并且指出法国对阿尔及利亚的要求是决不能被承认的。宰尼丁说：我们现在所希望的是，法国承认应该在联合国的帮助下逐渐把主权交还给阿尔及利亚。他说，这样做可以依照阿尔及利亚人民自由的意愿来保持阿尔及利亚和法国之间的合作。
    宰尼丁还追述了万隆会议关于阿尔及利亚问题的声明，并且指出，阿尔及利亚人民得到人类极大多数的支持。
    宰尼丁最后说，目前殖民主义依然存在，大会面临着三个殖民地问题：阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯和西伊里安。他说，殖民主义是折磨人类的疾病。他并且指责说，由于阿尔及利亚的情况，法国目前的威望在现代历史上是最低的。
    在宰尼丁发言后，委员会宣布休会。下次会议在5日继续举行。
