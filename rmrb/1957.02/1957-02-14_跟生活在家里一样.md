　　Like Living at Home
　　Han Yongfeng, Chinese Intern at the Moscow State First Ball Bearing Factory

　　We have been interning at the Moscow State First Ball Bearing Factory for more than half a year. In these six months, thanks to the earnest teaching and help of the Soviet teachers and friends, we have gradually mastered the advanced technology of manufacturing ball bearings. At the same time, the factory leaders and fellow workers have given us multifaceted care in our lives, making us deeply feel that living here is just like living at home.

　　Last year, when we first came to the Soviet Union for our internship, we encountered many difficulties: we didn't know the new technology of ball bearings, and we couldn't speak Russian. Before going abroad, we only studied Russian for three months, and when we first arrived, most people couldn't speak Russian with the Soviets. In order to help us quickly master Russian, the Soviet teachers thought of many good methods. Guteeva, a technician in the roller workshop, took time out of her busy schedule every day to teach Chinese intern Zhu Degui Russian, asking him to learn ten Russian words every day. She would teach today and check tomorrow. In this way, in less than two months, Zhu Degui memorized the Russian names of machine tool parts and tools. When intern Shao Xinde first came, he could only say one or two words when asking the teacher questions. The Soviet teacher stepped up teaching him Russian conversation. Now, the Russian level of the general interns has improved significantly, and they have initially mastered the professional study and daily life vocabulary. The improvement of Russian level has helped us to understand advanced technology theory and master process knowledge faster.

　　We will never forget the enthusiastic help of general adjuster Shanikov. In order to help intern Qian Zhonghua master the production technology of the more complex 12617-type machine tool, he specially stopped the production of his own machine tool and disassembled all the tools one by one to explain in detail. This complex machine tool is equipped with five tool holders and can clamp up to eleven tools. Whenever this machine tool changed production or had a small accident, Shanikov would always pull Qian Zhonghua to the machine tool to observe and explain. The technology of the machine tool studied by intern Qu Yannian was also more complicated, with many buttons, fast speed, and many drills. He had not operated this machine tool before. At first, he was a little afraid of accidents. Mikhailovna taught him how to operate it herself. The general production quota of this machine tool is 150 pieces. Soviet workers actually produce 170 pieces. However, Qu Yannian could only produce 60 to 70 pieces per shift. But under Mikhailovna's careful guidance, he was able to operate the machine tool independently within ten days, and the quality and quantity of his products reached the level of Soviet workers. In the workshop, we felt that every Soviet worker, regardless of age, was our teacher, because every Soviet worker was equally enthusiastic and willing to help us. Under their guidance, our technology has grown rapidly.

　　In daily life, we and Soviet friends have become brothers. Soviet friends are very concerned about our lives. Teachers often come to our dormitories to see if we are living well and eating enough. When female intern Pan Yanming was ill, her teacher asked her own daughter to come to the dormitory to accompany and take care of her. Soviet friends often invite Chinese interns to their homes as guests, preparing rich meals to entertain Chinese guests. We often participate in evening parties with Soviet friends, visit collective farms, museums, exhibition halls, stroll in parks, and watch movies.

    跟生活在家里一样
    莫斯科国家第一滚珠轴承制造厂中国实习生　韩永丰
    我们在莫斯科国家第一滚珠轴承制造厂实习已经半年多了。这半年里，由于苏联老师们、朋友们的认真教导和帮助，我们已经逐步掌握制造滚珠轴承的先进技术。同时，工厂的领导同志和工人同志们在生活上给我们以多方面的照顾，使我们深深感到，生活在这里跟生活在家里一样。
    去年，我们刚来苏联实习时，遇到了很多困难：滚珠轴承方面的新技术不知道，俄文又不通。出国前，我们只学过三个月的俄文，初到这里的时候，大部分人都不能用俄文同苏联人谈话。为了帮助我们迅速掌握俄文，苏联老师想了很多好方法。滚子车间技师古特科娃每天都在百忙中挤出时间教中国实习生朱德贵学习俄文，要他每天学会十个俄文单词。今天教，明天检查，就这样，不到两个月，朱德贵就记住了有关机床零件、工具的俄文名称。实习生邵新德刚来时，向老师提问题，只能说上一、两个单词。苏联老师就加紧教他俄文会话。到现在，一般实习生的俄文水平都有了显著的提高，初步掌握了专业学习和日常生活用语。俄文水平的提高，帮助我们更快地理解先进技术理论和掌握工艺知识。
    总调整工沙尼可夫的热情帮助，使我们永远不能忘怀。他为了帮助实习生钱仲华掌握结构较为复杂的12617型机床生产技术，特地停止了自己机床的生产，把所有的刀具一把把卸下来，详细讲解。这种复杂机床装有五个刀架，最多能夹十一把刀子。每逢这架机床更换生产品，或者发生一点小事故时，沙尼可夫总要拉着钱仲华一起到机床前察看、讲解。实习生曲延年学习的那部机床技术也是较为复杂的，电钮多、速度快、钻头多，以前他没有操作过这种机床。起初，他多少有点害怕出事故。米哈利夫娜亲手教他操作。这架机床一般的生产定额是一百五十个活。苏联工人实际生产是一百七十个。而曲延年一班只能生产六、七十个。但就在米哈利夫娜的细心教导下，十天内他就能独立操纵这架机床，而且生产品的质量和数量达到了苏联工人的水平。在车间里，我们感到每一个苏联工人不管老年、青年都是我们的老师，因为每一个苏联工人都同样热情地愿意帮助我们。在他们的指导下，我们的技术才迅速成长起来。
    在日常生活中，我们和苏联朋友结成了兄弟。苏联朋友们十分关心我们的生活。老师们经常来我们宿舍，看看我们住得好不好，吃得够不够。女实习生潘沿明生病时，她的老师叫自己的女儿来宿舍作伴、照顾。苏联朋友经常请中国实习生到自己家里作客，准备丰富的饭菜招待中国客人。我们常常和苏联朋友们一起参加晚会，参观集体农庄、博物馆、展览馆、逛公园、看电影。
