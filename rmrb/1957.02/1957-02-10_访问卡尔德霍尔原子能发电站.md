    Visiting Calder Hall Atomic Power Station By our reporter Su Lan
    After a night on the train, we arrived at Calder Hall as the sky was already bright. Stepping out of the warm carriage, a refreshing cold wind rushed towards us, instantly making us feel invigorated. It was much more comfortable than breathing the soot-filled air in London.

    There were no residential areas near the station. To the right was an endless expanse of ocean, the light blue sea throwing up clusters of white waves. To the left, in the distance, through the morning mist, we could vaguely see several mountain peaks. If we hadn't seen the towering cooling towers of the atomic power station after leaving the station, we would have thought we were in the wrong place.

    It is said that, besides Malenkov, we were the second group of guests from the "East" to visit Calder Hall atomic power station. We must thank the British Atomic Energy Authority for the arrangements made for our visit. The committee also sent Mr. Manley to accompany us. He provided a lot of help to us. This gentleman couldn't be said to have any sympathy for socialism, and even had many prejudices. He believed that traveling behind the "Iron Curtain" was a life-threatening risk, even though he himself had visited Prague a few years ago and returned safely. However, he was also dissatisfied with the United States. When talking about the atomic power station, his face was filled with pride. Finally, he put his hands in his trouser pockets, shrugged his shoulders, and said, "In America, there are only atomic bombs."

    A narrow concrete road, like an airplane runway, led directly from this small station to the gate of the power station. It took us about ten minutes to walk this road, and then we were stopped at the gate. Here, we had to fill out all sorts of forms and sign all sorts of cards. Completing these procedures took almost twenty minutes.

    We were received by Mr. Frost. This young man introduced us to the scale of the power station and the simple principles of atomic power generation. The construction of this power station began in April 1953, divided into two sets, A and B, each with two reactors. In October last year, one reactor in set A had already begun generating electricity, with a generating capacity of 28,000 kilowatts. It is said that when sets A and B are fully operational in 1958, the generating capacity will be 184,000 kilowatts, which can supply electricity to 200,000 people. A simple chart illustrated how uranium 235 is converted into power.

    In principle, the Calder Hall power station is similar to the Soviet atomic power station. Frost used a simple diagram to tell us: the reactor generates heat energy, which is led by fluid through pipes to the heat exchanger; the heat exchanger turns water into steam, and the steam is led through a series of pipes to the turbine, driving the generator to produce electricity. Of course, the process described here in such simple terms is a very complex scientific problem.

    Our visit began with the reactor. The reactor was housed in a five-story rectangular building. Four huge heat exchangers, almost as tall as the building, were closely attached to the four corners of the building. The shape of the heat exchangers was very similar to enlarged sausages, held upright by sturdy iron frames. There were also some thick pipes, running around the outside, like ropes tying up the sausages.

    After entering the building, the elevator took us all the way to the top—the fifth floor. It was very spacious here. Apart from a machine for loading uranium rods that could be pushed around, there was almost nothing else. The floor was covered with steel plates, with dozens of sealed channels on top. The uranium rods were loaded from here. Below our feet was the top of the pineapple-shaped reactor. This reactor was composed of 130 tons of uranium and 2,000 tons of graphite. However, it was very safe here, because the reactor was wrapped in 15 cm of steel plate and 2 meters of concrete. In this way, the escaping neutrons could not penetrate this special wall and hurt people.

    We followed the zig-zag staircase to the fourth floor. From this floor down, we were all on the side of the reactor. In this small room (because the reactor had taken up a lot of space), there were some uranium rods. The uranium rods were wrapped in zinc. They were slightly thinner than a wrist, standing upright on the ground, reaching to a person's chest. When we mentioned that the principle of generating electricity with atomic energy was no longer a secret, Mr. Manley immediately said: "There are two secrets here." He also solemnly stated: "My task is to keep secrets from you." Perhaps this is the "secret" that Manley was referring to: Calder Hall uses natural uranium; the Soviet atomic power station uses enriched uranium. However, for us, we did not want to pry into the "secrets" here. We admire the achievements of British scientists in technology; but we also admire the scientists of socialist countries, who were the first to build an atomic power station.

    We passed through the third floor where gas was checked, and the second floor where the reactor was controlled. Both were filled with instruments. There were not many staff. The entire power station has a total of 400 employees, including 70 technicians. The people we met here were all wearing white coats, looking very much like doctors in a hospital. It was not until the last floor of the building, when we saw the loud machines, that we realized that this was a factory. What is puzzling is, who is served by the enormous energy generated by this reactor? Frost told us: "In 1953, some reactors were built to produce some plutonium. At the same time as producing plutonium, a lot of heat was also produced. This raised the question of how to use this heat." Thus, there was the Calder Hall power station. However, Sir Christopher Hinton, Managing Director of the Industrial Group of the UKAEA, wrote in an article: "The purpose of building atomic power stations is to produce plutonium. And electricity is only a useful by-product." Is this electricity a by-product of military industry? Or was it simply built for military needs – we are not very clear. However, right next to the Calder Hall power station is the British Windscale nuclear facility, which is entirely for military purposes.

    Not far from the reactor is the turbine hall. It is clean and bright here. The four turbines are painted light green and pale yellow, arranged in a line in the center of the hall. Around them are large and small pipes, some of which are one meter in diameter, like the red beams on Tiananmen Square; the smaller ones are only as thick as fingers. Only two turbines have started working here, but the roar of the machines is deafening. You have to shout to talk. When I asked about the production cost of the power station, Frost said:

    "Using uranium as fuel costs about one-third more than coal. If you add in transportation costs, it's about the same. And it's much cleaner."

    Indeed, you can't see the thick smoke that comes out of ordinary power stations here.

    The Atomic Energy Authority only arranged a three-hour visit for us. Just as we were about to say goodbye, we were suddenly notified that the manager and deputy manager of the power station wanted to host us for lunch. In the restaurant, we met these two people in charge. They are not only the administrative managers of the power station, but also the technical instructors. In a pleasant atmosphere, we finished our steaks. At this time, the deputy manager suddenly asked us: "Do your Chinese newspapers report real news?"

    This sudden question surprised us very much. General Manager Streach looked at his companion with a complaining look, and immediately jokingly explained to us: "Why did he ask that? Because British newspapers never tell the truth." So there was a burst of "haha" between the host and guests, and we ended our visit to Calder Hall in this laughter. (Attached picture)

### 访问卡尔德霍尔原子能发电站

    访问卡尔德霍尔原子能发电站	本报记者　苏蓝
    在火车上睡了一夜，我们到达卡尔德霍尔的时候，天已经大亮。走出温暖的车厢，迎面扑来一股清新的冷风，顿时使人精神爽快，这比在伦敦呼吸那种掺了煤烟的空气，要舒服多了。
    车站附近没有居民区，右边是一望无际的海洋，浅蓝色的海水抛出一簇簇白色的浪花。左边远处，透过清晨的薄雾，可以隐隐约约地看到几个山头。要不是在走出车站后望见了原子能发电站的高大的冷却塔，我们准会以为找错了地方。
    据说，来到卡尔德霍尔参观原子能发电站的，除了马林科夫以外，我们是第二批来自“东方”的客人。不能不感谢英国原子能委员会对我们这次访问所作的安排，委员会还派了曼利先生陪着我们。他对我们作了不少帮助。这位先生对于社会主义说不上有什么同情，甚至还有不少偏见。他认为到“铁幕”后面去旅行，得冒着生命的危险。尽管他本人就在几年前到过布拉格，而且平平安安地回来了。但是，他也不满意美国。当谈到原子能发电站的时候，他的脸上充满自豪，最后把两手向裤子口袋里一插，耸耸肩膀：“在美国，只有原子弹”。
    一条不宽的水泥路，好像飞机跑道，从这个小小的车站直通发电站大门。我们用了大约十分钟的时间走完了这段路，然后在大门口被拦住了，在这里，要填写各种各样的表格，在各种各样的卡片上签字。办完这些手续，花去了将近二十分钟。
    接待我们的是弗罗斯特先生，这位年轻人，向我们介绍了发电站的规模和原子能发电的简单原理。这个发电站是在1953年4月开始兴建的，分甲、乙两套，每套有两个反应堆。去年10月，甲套中的一个反应堆已经开始发电，发电能力共二万八千瓩。据说，到1958年甲、乙两套全部投入生产后，发电能力将为十八万四千瓩，可以供应二十万人的用电。一套简单的图表，说明铀235怎样变成动力。
    从原理上讲，卡尔德霍尔发电站和苏联的原子能发电站是差不多的。弗罗斯特用简略的图解告诉我们：反应堆产生热能，这种热能由流体经过管道引到热交换器内；热交换器把水变成蒸汽，蒸汽又通过一系列的管道，引向透平，推动发电机，产生电流。当然，在这里叙述的如此简单的过程，在科学上是个十分复杂的问题。
    我们的参观从反应堆开始。放置反应堆的，是个五层楼高的长方形大厦。四个和大楼几乎同样高的巨大热交换器，紧贴在它外面的四个角上。热交换器的外形，很像一节放大了的腊肠，坚实的铁架，把它竖立起来。还有一些粗大的管道，纵横地围绕在它的外面，像是捆着腊肠的绳子。
    进入大楼后，电梯把我们一直带到顶端——第五层。这儿十分宽敞，除了一部可以推来推去的装添铀棒的机器以外，几乎没有别的东西。地上铺着钢板，上面有几十个封闭了的孔道。铀棒就是从这里装进去的。在我们的脚下，就是个菠萝形状的反应堆的顶部。这个反应堆，是由一百三十吨铀和二千吨石墨组成的，然而这里十分安全，因为反应堆已经用十五公分的钢板和二公尺厚的水泥包裹起来。这样，飞逸出来的中子，就不能透过这层特别的墙壁伤人了。
    我们顺着“之”字形的楼梯，到了第四层。从这一层以下，我们都是在反应堆的侧面了。在这间不大的房子里（因为反应堆已经占去了很大的空间），摆着一些铀棒。铀棒是用锌包起来的。它比手腕略细一些，竖在地上，可以齐到人的胸部。当我们提到用原子能发电的原理已经不成为秘密的时候，曼利先生马上说：“这里有两个秘密。”他还郑重其事地表示：“我的任务就是对你们保守秘密。”也许，这就是曼利所指的“秘密”所在：卡尔德霍尔所用的铀是天然铀；苏联原子能发电站用的是浓缩铀。不过，对于我们来说，我们并不想窥探这里的“秘密”。我们钦佩英国科学家在技术上所获得的成就；但是，我们也钦佩社会主义国家的科学家们，他们是第一个建成原子能发电站的。
    我们经过了检查瓦斯的第三层楼和控制反应堆的第二层楼。这里都摆满了仪器。工作人员并不多。整个发电站工作人员共四百名，其中包括七十名技术人员。我们在这儿碰到的人，都穿着白色的罩衫。从外貌看来，很像医院里的大夫。直到大楼的最后一层，看到发出巨响的机器，才使我们意识到这儿是一个工厂。使人纳闷的是，这个反应堆所发出来的巨大的能，是为谁服务的？弗罗斯特对我们说：“1953年为了生产一些钚，所以建立了一些反应堆。生产钚的同时，也生产了很多热量。这就发生了怎样利用这些热量的问题。”于是，就有了卡尔德霍尔发电站。但是，英国原子能委员会工业总经理赫登在一篇文章里是这样写的：“建设原子能发电站的目的都是为了生产钚。而电力只是一种有用的副产品。”究竟这些电能是军事工业的副产品呢？还是它干脆就是因为军事需要建立起来的呢——我们不十分清楚。但是，就在卡尔德霍尔发电站的旁边，是英国温特斯克尔原子能中心，它是完全为军事目的服务的。
    离反应堆不远，是透平大厅。这儿清洁畅亮。四个透平粉刷成浅绿和淡黄色。一字排列在大厅中央。在它们的周围，布满大大小小的管道，这些管道大的直径有一公尺，如同天安门上的红色梁柱；小的只有手指那么粗。在这里，只有两个透平开始了工作，但机器的轰鸣，已是震耳欲聋。谈起话来，都得放开喉咙。当我问到发电站生产成本时。弗罗斯特说：
    “以铀作燃料，要比煤费三分之一左右。假若把运输费算在一起，就差不多了。而且干净得多。”
    的确，在这里看不到一般发电站冒出来的那种浓烟。
    原子能委员会只为我们安排了三个小时的访问。当我们正要辞别的时候，忽然被通知说：发电站的经理和副经理要招待我们午餐。在餐厅里，我们和这两位负责人见了面。他们不仅是发电站的行政管理者，也是技术上的指导者。在愉快的气氛中，我们嚼完了牛排。这时，副经理忽然问我们：“你们中国报纸是否报道真实消息？”
    这个突如其来的问题，使我们觉得十分奇怪，总经理斯特雷奇先生用抱怨的眼色看了看他的同伴，马上半开玩笑地向我们说明：“他为什么这样问呢？因为英国的报纸从来不说实话。”于是主客之间一阵“哈哈”，我们就在这哈哈声中结束了对卡尔德霍尔的访问。（附图片）
