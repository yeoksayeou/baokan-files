Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th. The Soviet "Friendship Railway" from Aktogay station to the border of Xinjiang, China, will lay 150 kilometers of track this year, about half of the entire line.

    So far, the roadbed of this railway has been built for 60 kilometers, and the laying of 20 kilometers of heavy steel rails has been completed.

    Aktogay was originally a small station on the Soviet Turkestan-Siberia Railway line, with only a few station buildings. Now, dozens of houses have been built here, the power station has been energized, and warehouses, railway branch lines, etc. have been completed. A huge hub station is beginning to take shape.

    Workers from Belarus, Ukraine and other places are engaged in competition in the construction project. They over fulfill their work plans every day even in the severe winter cold. When they heard that the construction workers of China's Lanxin Railway had laid tracks close to Xinjiang, they excitedly said: We are about to meet Chinese comrades. They decided to continue to over fulfill the planned track-laying tasks.

    苏联通向我国新疆边境的“友谊铁路”
    今年将铺轨一百五十公里
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联阿克斗卡站到中国新疆边境的“友谊铁路”今年将铺轨一百五十公里，约等于全线的一半。
    到目前为止，这条铁路的路基已经筑成了六十公里，并且已经完成二十公里重型钢轨的铺设工程。
    阿克斗卡原来是苏联土西铁路线上的一个小站，只有很少的几间站房。现在，这里已经建造了数十幢房屋，发电站已经送电，仓库、铁路支线等都已经建设完成。一个巨大的枢纽站已经初具规模。
    从白俄罗斯、乌克兰等地来的工人在建设工程中展开竞赛。他们即使在冬天的严寒中也每天超额完成工作计划。当他们听到中国兰新铁路的建筑工人已经铺轨接近新疆的消息时，他们兴奋地说：我们快要同中国同志见面了。他们决定要继续不断地超额完成计划中的铺轨任务。
