Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 20th - The Gansu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has decided this year to promote the soil and water conservation methods of six areas throughout the province: Dengjiabao in Wushan County, Leijiagou in Pingliang County, Zhangjiagou in Jingning County, Tianjiazhuang in Tianshui County, Zhangjiacha in Longxi County, and Majiagou in Qin'an County. The soil and water conservation methods in these six areas have the following characteristics: they can eradicate soil erosion; they can increase agricultural production; they can green barren slopes and solve the local fuel shortage; they do not require the labor assistance of other cooperatives; and they do not require state investment.

The methods of soil and water conservation adopted in these six areas, namely "comprehensive management, combining gully and surface," "water storage and soil conservation, closing runoff, considering both gully and slope," and "integrated agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry measures, combining gully and surface management," can not only conserve water and soil, prevent floods, and increase production, but also manage one mountain to consolidate one mountain, and manage one gully to consolidate one gully. After Dengjiabao in Wushan County was managed using the method of "water storage and soil conservation, closing runoff, considering both gully and slope," grain production rose sharply, from only 80 jin per mu in 1952 to 310 jin in 1956. After Majiagou in Qin'an County basically achieved having ridges on every piece of land and ponds in each branch gully and low-lying area, it has achieved the purpose of intercepting water and storing sediment. In three to five years, sediment will not leave the gully, water will not flow down from the plateau, the entire gully will be greened, and it will be able to harvest more than one million jin of fruit and four million jin of firewood every year.

In the past, most areas in Gansu Province lacked planning in soil and water conservation work. In one area, some built field ridges, some made water scoops, some planted grass in this gully, and some planted trees in that gully, resulting in a failure to conserve soil and water. Many areas concentrated a large amount of labor and financial resources on managing the gully mouths and building large dams, but many of the dams were washed away by mountain floods. This year, Gansu Province will change the past practice of focusing on managing gully mouths while neglecting slope surfaces and ignoring agricultural production increases, and will emphasize comprehensive management, combining gully and surface, to launch large-scale soil and water conservation work. The practices of Dengjiabao in Wushan County and Leijiagou in Pingliang County and other places provide good examples for carrying out soil and water conservation work throughout the province.

### “综合治理”的水土保持方法好  甘肃省决定今年在全省各地推广

    “综合治理”的水土保持方法好
    甘肃省决定今年在全省各地推广
    新华社兰州20日电　甘肃省水利局今年决定在全省推广武山县邓家堡、平凉县雷家沟、静宁县张家沟、天水县田家庄、陇西县张家岔、秦安县麻家沟等六个地区的水土保持工作方法。这六个地区的水土保持工作方法具备这样一些特点：能根治水土流失；能增加农业生产量；能绿化荒坡和解决当地燃料不足问题；不需要其他社的劳力帮助；不需要国家投资。
    这六个地区采取的“综合治理，沟面结合”“蓄水保土，封闭径流，沟坡兼顾”“农林牧综合措施，沟面结合治理”的保持水土的方法，不仅能保水保土、防洪增产，而且可以治一山巩固一山，治一沟巩固一沟。武山县邓家堡用“蓄水保土，封闭径流，沟坡兼顾”的方法治理后，粮食产量笔直上升，1952年每亩才产粮食八十斤，到1956年即达到三百一十斤。秦安县麻家沟基本上做到地地有埂，各支沟和腰陷处有涝池以后，已达到拦水蓄泥的目的，三、五年后，这里即可泥不出沟，水不下原，全沟绿化，每年能收水果一百多万斤，烧柴四百万斤。
    甘肃省过去多数地区水土保持工作缺乏计划性，在一个地区里，有的培地埂，有的做水簸箕，这条沟里种草，那条沟里种树，结果不能保着水土。不少地区将大批的劳力、财力集中治理沟口，打大坝，结果大坝多被山洪冲垮。今年甘肃省将改变过去重治沟口，轻治坡面，忽视农业增产的做法，强调综合治理，沟面结合，展开大规模的水土保持工作，武山邓家堡、平凉县雷家沟等地的做法，为开展全省的水土保持工作提供了良好的范例。
