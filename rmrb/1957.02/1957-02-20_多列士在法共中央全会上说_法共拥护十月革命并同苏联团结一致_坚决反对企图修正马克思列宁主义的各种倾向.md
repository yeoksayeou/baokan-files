Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th -- According to a TASS report from Paris: "L'Humanité" published on the 18th Thorez's speech at the French Communist Party Central Committee plenary session, discussing Guyot's report on the relations between the French Communist Party and the Communist and Workers' Parties of other countries.

Thorez first pointed out that the relations between the French Communist Party and its fraternal parties are currently in a stage where many significant changes have taken place. The consistent policy of the French Communist Party is: it is necessary to wage an irreconcilable struggle against formalism and dogmatism, and to implement new measures suitable for the changed situation. In this regard, Thorez mentioned the struggle to win united action by the working people and the struggle for a people's front, and the issue of adopting new forms in relations with the Communist and Workers' Parties of other countries. He said that representatives of the French Communist Party will soon meet with the Communists of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.

Thorez emphasized that proletarian internationalism in no way violates national interests. He said that the Central Committee of the French Communist Party firmly opposes all tendencies attempting to revise Marxism-Leninism. He called for vigilance against attempts to obliterate the class struggle and its decisive role in various events at home and abroad; against attempts to cast doubt on the fundamental principles of the time-tested doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and to doubt the necessity of the unity of the Party ranks.

He said that the French Communist Party openly declares its support for the glorious October Revolution and its solidarity with the Soviet state. He pointed out that this is consistent with the interests of the French working class and the interests of the French nation.

Thorez concluded by saying that the French Communist Party will strive to better conduct the struggle for bread, for trade union rights and democratic freedoms, for national independence and peace, and for socialism. The French Communist Party will soon strive to launch a broad struggle against the new threat to the security of France and Europe caused by the revival of German militarism. In addition, the French Communist Party will also strive to unite the broad masses of the French people in order to finally achieve peace in Algeria under conditions that are in the interests of both the French people and the Algerian people.

    多列士在法共中央全会上说
    法共拥护十月革命并同苏联团结一致
    坚决反对企图修正马克思列宁主义的各种倾向
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：“人道报”18日刊载了多列士在法国共产党中央委员会全体会议讨论居约所作关于法国共产党同其他国家的共产党和工人党的关系的报告时的发言。
    多列士首先指出，法国共产党同兄弟党的关系目前正处在一个发生了许多重大变革的阶段。法国共产党活动的一贯方针是：必须同形式主义和墨守成规作不调和的斗争，执行适合于已经发生变化的局势的新措施。在这方面，多列士提到了争取劳动人民行动一致和争取人民阵线的斗争，提到了在同其他国家共产党和工人党的关系中采取新形式的问题。他说，最近法国共产党的代表将同南斯拉夫和保加利亚的共产党人会晤。
    多列士着重指出，无产阶级国际主义绝不违反民族利益。他说，法国共产党中央委员会坚决反对企图修正马克思列宁主义的各种倾向。他号召提高警惕，以反对那些想抹煞阶级斗争及其在国内和国际范围内各种事件中的决定性作用的企图；反对想使人怀疑马克思列宁主义久经考验的学说的原则基础、怀疑党的队伍团结的必要性的企图。
    他说，法国共产党公开宣布它拥护光辉的十月革命，并且同苏维埃国家团结一致。他指出，这是同法国工人阶级的利益和法国民族利益一致的。
    多列士最后说，法国共产党将努力为争取面包、争取工会权利和民主自由、争取民族独立和和平以及争取社会主义而更好地进行斗争。法国共产党最近将努力展开广泛的斗争来反对由于复活德国军国主义而使法国和欧洲安全受到的新威胁。此外，法国共产党还将努力团结广大法国人民，以便在符合法国人民和阿尔及利亚人民双方利益的条件下最后取得阿尔及利亚的和平。
