Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Telegram: As the ice and snow in the frontier regions begin to melt, agricultural cooperative members of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are universally launching preparations for spring ploughing.

From the foot of the Helan Mountains to the eastern foothills of the Greater Khingan Mountains, across thousands of miles of fields and villages, agricultural cooperative members of all nationalities are digging wells and opening canals, storing ice and water, hauling soil and delivering manure, selecting seeds, and repairing farm tools. In twelve banners and counties of Hulunbuir League, Jirem League, and Pingdi Quan Administrative District, members of all nationalities have now completed and are in the process of constructing 7,900 frozen wells. In the Zhaowuda League, which has more mountainous terrain, agricultural cooperatives in six banners and counties have built 80 new canals and repaired more than 260 old canals. In addition, they are impounding water and storing ice in more than 770 mountain gullies, preparing for spring irrigation. The Hetao area and Bayannur League, which have a tradition of conserving soil moisture in the spring, will soon complete the first rolling of farmland. The work of accumulating fertilizer and delivering manure has been underway in most areas since winter. Currently, the members of the Zhaowuda League have accumulated enough fertilizer to fertilize more than 12 million mu of farmland, accounting for 84% of the sown area. Farmers in Ongniud Banner had delivered 70% of their manure to the fields before the Spring Festival. In Hanggin Rear Banner in the Hetao area, where spring wheat will be sown, soil improvement has been carried out on more than 40% of the land.

From November of last year to January of this year, the income from various sideline occupations in the Autonomous Region's twenty-nine banners and counties and the suburban area of Baotou City has reached more than 18 million yuan, part of which has been used to purchase various means of production.

The Autonomous Region's supply and marketing cooperatives have transported a large number of materials such as farm tools, pesticides, and pesticide equipment to various places about half a month in advance. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region branch of the Agricultural Bank of China has issued agricultural and pastoral loans of more than 69.7 million yuan, an increase of 1.5 million yuan over last year.
