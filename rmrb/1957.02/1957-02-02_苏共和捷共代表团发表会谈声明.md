Xinhua News Agency, January 1st dispatch: According to TASS, after the representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia held talks in Moscow on January 29th and 31st, a statement of the talks was signed on January 31st. The statement was signed by Khrushchev, First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on the CPSU side, and Novotny, First Secretary of the CPCz Central Committee, on the CPCz side.

The statement of the talks said that the representatives of the CPSU and CPCz exchanged information on the situations of the two parties, discussed issues related to the further development of the fraternal relations between the two parties, and pressing issues such as the international situation and the international workers' movement. The representatives of the two parties were in complete agreement on all the issues discussed.

The statement pointed out that the two parties have made great achievements in leading the economic and cultural construction of their respective countries and in the struggle to safeguard and consolidate international peace.

Both sides also pointed out that during the fascist riots in Hungary, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other socialist countries, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, unanimously gave help and support to the revolutionary forces of the Hungarian people, and the people of these countries were more closely united around their communist parties and people's governments.

The representatives of both sides pointed out that the international situation has recently become tense due to the aggressive actions of imperialist countries. Therefore, the communist and workers' parties of all countries must be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism and must strengthen the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace.

The two party delegations believe that it must be particularly pointed out that the serious threat to peace and security is exacerbated by the measures taken by the imperialist bloc to accelerate the militarization of West Germany. The people of countries neighboring Germany and all other countries concerned with maintaining peace must remain vigilant.

The statement then emphasized that the representatives of the CPSU and the CPCz believe that it is the common obligation of the two parties to strive for the further strengthening of the fighting unity of the socialist countries and to wage a more resolute struggle for the unity of the communist and workers' parties of all countries on the basis of Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

The representatives of the two parties believe that, as Lenin taught, strengthening the spirit of proletarian internationalism in the ranks of the communist and workers' parties is inextricably linked to resolutely combating all kinds of wavering and departures from this long-tested principle, actions that roll towards nationalism and revisionism, actions that pit some nations against others, some communist parties against others, and the recently disseminated ideas of so-called "national communism."

In order to further strengthen the world socialist system, the unity of views and actions of the communist and workers' parties of all countries on the fundamental issues of socialist construction is of particular importance. The common and major laws established by Marxist-Leninist theory determine the path that all countries take toward socialism and communism, but the specific forms and methods can vary due to different historical and national characteristics.

The statement pointed out that the correctness of Lenin's theories on the role of the proletarian dictatorship in the struggle to build socialism; on the paramount importance of the working class Marxist party leading the masses, constantly strengthening the ideological unity of this party, and consolidating its ties with the masses for the success of this struggle; on the need to consolidate and expand socialist state ownership and socialist public ownership and to develop a planned economy; on the need to continuously deepen and improve socialist democracy by absorbing the broad masses to participate in the management of state and social life in forms that are adapted to the traditions and conditions of each country; on the need to resolutely defend the achievements of the socialist revolution from the encroachment of the former ruling classes and exploiting classes and from the invasion of imperialist reactionaries, has been fully confirmed by the experience and practice of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and all other socialist countries.

The participants in the talks unanimously pointed out that an unbreakable fraternal relationship based on the principles of complete equality and mutual respect has been formed between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The delegations of the two parties reiterated their determination to continue to develop and strengthen the fraternal ties between them in the future. They believe that the international and domestic conditions of their countries' development require this. To this end, the representatives of the two parties agreed to take measures to establish closer and more frequent contacts between the CPSU and the CPCz in order to expand the exchange of information and the mutual introduction of the parties' work experience by means of exchanging party delegations, exchanging party publications, and other forms that are deemed appropriate. Measures will also be taken to further expand the contacts and exchange of experience between the trade unions, youth, and other social organizations of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.

The statement said that the delegations of the two parties emphasized the great significance of the meetings of representatives of the communist parties of all countries, because such meetings and exchanges of views can promote the further strengthening of the unity between the communist parties of all countries. The talks decided that, when necessary, the CPSU and the CPCz will continue to hold such meetings. At the same time, the unanimous desire and determination of the two parties to further develop cooperation and contacts with all fraternal communist and workers' parties was also emphasized.

    苏共和捷共代表团发表会谈声明
    两党代表对所讨论的全部问题意见完全一致。各国共产党和工人党必须对帝国主义的阴谋提高警惕，加强保卫和平的斗争。加强共产党和工人党在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结和党的队伍中的无产阶级国际主义精神，对民族主义和修正主义进行坚决斗争。两党代表团重申今后继续发展和加强它们之间牢不可破的兄弟关系。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党代表团和捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团1月29日和31日在莫斯科举行了会谈以后，在1月31日签署了会谈声明。在声明上签字的，苏共方面是苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫，捷共方面是捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼。
    会谈声明说，苏共和捷共代表团相互交换了关于两个党的状况的情报，讨论了有关进一步发展两党兄弟关系的问题和国际局势和国际工人运动等迫切问题。两党代表对所讨论的全部问题意见完全一致。
    声明指出，两党在领导本国的经济和文化建设方面，在为维护和巩固国际和平而进行的斗争方面，已经取得了巨大的成就。
    双方还指出，在匈牙利发生法西斯暴乱的期间，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和其它社会主义国家本着无产阶级国际主义原则，一致给予匈牙利人民的革命力量以帮助和支持，而这些国家的人民也更加紧密地团结在自己的共产党和人民政府的周围。
    双方代表指出，由于帝国主义国家的侵略行为使得国际局势最近趋于紧张，因此各国共产党和工人党必须对帝国主义的阴谋提高警惕，必须加强为维护和巩固和平而斗争。
    两党代表团认为必须特别指出，对和平和安全的严重威胁因帝国主义集团采取的加速西德军国主义化的措施而加剧。作为德国近邻的国家和其他一切关心维护和平的国家的人民不得不保持警惕。
    声明接着强调说，苏共和捷共的代表认为，为争取社会主义各国战斗的团结的进一步加强、争取各国共产党和工人党在马克思列宁主义学说基础上的团结进行更顽强的斗争，是两党的共同义务。
    两党代表认为，像列宁所教导的，加强共产党和工人党队伍中的无产阶级国际主义精神，同对各种各样动摇和离开这项久经考验的原则、对滚向民族主义和修正主义立场的行为和把一些民族同另一些民族、一些共产党同另一些共产党对立起来的行为、对最近散布的所谓“民族共产主义”思想进行坚决斗争，有着不可分割的联系。
    为了进一步加强世界社会主义体系，各国共产党和工人党在社会主义建设根本问题上的观点和行动的一致有特别重要的意义。所有的国家走向社会主义和共产主义的大道都是由马克思列宁主义理论所确立的共同的主要规律性决定的，但是各国因为历史和民族等特点不同，可以在具体的形式和方法上多种多样。
    声明指出，列宁关于无产阶级专政在建成社会主义的斗争中的作用；关于工人阶级马克思主义政党领导群众、不断加强这个政党的思想统一和巩固它同群众的联系对这个斗争的成功具有头等意义；关于必须巩固并扩大社会主义国家所有制和社会主义公有制以及发展计划经济；关于必须通过适应每个国家的传统和条件的形式吸收广大群众参与管理国家生活和社会生活，借以不断加深和改进社会主义民主；关于必须坚决保卫社会主义革命的成果不受过去的统治阶级、剥削阶级的侵害、不受帝国主义反动派的侵犯等的理论的正确性，完全被苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和其他所有社会主义国家的社会主义建设的经验和实践所证实了。
    会谈参加者一致指出，在苏联共产党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党之间形成了以完全平等和相互尊重的原则为基础的牢不可破的兄弟关系。两党代表团再次重申两党今后继续发展和加强它们之间的兄弟联系的决心。它们认为，它们国家发展的国际条件和国内条件都要求这样做。两党代表为此取得协议，将采取措施在苏共和捷共之间建立更紧密、更经常的接触，以互派党代表团、交换党出版物的方法和其他被认为合适的形式，来扩大互通消息和互相介绍党的工作经验。还要采取措施来进一步扩大苏联和捷克斯洛伐克的工会、青年和其他社会团体之间的接触和经验交流。
    声明说，两党代表团强调指出各国共产党代表会见的巨大意义，因为这种会见和意见交换可以促进各国共产党之间的团结的更进一步加强。会谈决定，在必要时苏共和捷共将继续举行这种会见。同时还强调指出了两党对进一步发展同一切兄弟共产党和工人党的合作和联系的一致愿望和决心。
