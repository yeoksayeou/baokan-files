Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, 21st: After the Longsheng Various Nationalities Autonomous County in Guangxi Province achieved the ethnicization of its organs, the connection between the leading organs and the masses has become closer.

A three-level cadre meeting in the county had just ended a few days ago, and more than 80 county and district-level cadres from directly affiliated organs, carrying their luggage, went to the villages with the township cadres and cooperative chairmen who attended the meeting to assist farmers of all ethnic groups in carrying out spring plowing. Because cadres from their own ethnic groups are familiar with local customs and ethnic sentiments, the vast majority of the 28 county-level cadres and more than 50 principal responsible personnel in the six districts are assigned to lead work in areas of the same ethnic group according to their ethnic composition. When the Dong County Chief Wang Xiong arrives in Dong-populated areas, the Dong people ask him all sorts of questions, talking about everything from national construction and their children’s marriages to cooking oil, salt, tea, and water. In the Dong areas of Pingdeng District, Dong farmers, regardless of age or gender, are accustomed to gathering in the drum tower (every village has one) after dinner to chat about family matters and friendship. When Dong cadres come here, they happily go to the drum tower to share joy and happiness with the masses before holding meetings, so the masses are very satisfied.

Because cadres of their own ethnic groups are in contact with the masses, the materials they grasp are relatively rich and specific, so they can promptly raise newly occurring problems. The inherent habits of Zhuang farmers loving to grow peppers, Dong farmers loving to grow cotton and glutinous rice, and Yao farmers loving to grow indigo were once ignored during the high tide of agricultural cooperation, and diversified operations were not developed. Zhuang, Dong, and Yao farmers raised their reasonable demands and suggestions through cadres of their own ethnic groups, and soon these biases that ignored the planting habits of farmers of all ethnic groups were quickly corrected. Once, a Yao cadre from the Organization Department of the County Party Committee went to work in Neiyin Township, a backward area. The local Yao farmers said to him: "You've finally come down. Do the cadres dislike us for being backward and don't want to work here? The palm and the back of the hand are both flesh!" Later, this Yao cadre reported to the higher authorities, and the County Party Committee immediately decided to strengthen leadership in backward areas, so that the progress of work in various places gradually reached a balance.

Under the test of the severe drought last year, the 95 agricultural and forestry cooperatives in the autonomous county still had a slight increase in agricultural and sideline production, the afforestation area increased by three and a half times compared to the original, and the average purchasing power per person increased from 36 yuan to 45 yuan.

### 龙胜各族自治县实现机关民族化  干部和群众关系更加密切

    龙胜各族自治县实现机关民族化
    干部和群众关系更加密切
    新华社桂林21日电　广西省龙胜各族自治县实现机关民族化之后，领导机关和群众的联系更加密切。
    前两天，县里的三级干部会议刚刚结束，直属机关八十多名县、区级干部就扛着行李，和参加会议的乡干部、社主任一同入村，协助各族农民开展春耕生产。由于本民族干部熟悉当地的风俗习惯和民族感情，全县二十八名县级干部和六个区的五十多名主要负责人员，绝大多数都是按照民族成分分工领导相同民族地区的工作。侗族县长王雄一到侗族聚居地区，侗族群众向他问长问短，从国家建设、儿女婚事到油盐茶水，无所不说。在平等区的侗族农民，不论男女老少都习惯在晚饭后聚集到鼓楼里（村村都有）谈家常，叙友情。侗族干部到这里来，却高高兴兴到鼓楼里先同群众言欢同乐，然后开会，因此群众都很满意。
    本民族干部因为联系群众，掌握的材料比较丰富具体，所以能及时提出新发生的问题。僮族农民爱种辣椒，侗族农民爱种棉花、糯米，瑶族农民爱种蓝靛的固有习惯，在农业合作化高潮中曾经一度被忽视，多种经营也没有开展起来。僮、侗、瑶等族农民通过本族干部，提出自己的合理要求和建议，不久这些忽视各族农民种植习惯的偏向便很快被纠正了。有一次，县委组织部一个瑶族干部到后进地区内银乡工作，当地瑶族农民对他说：“你可下来了。干部们是不是嫌我们落后不愿来这里工作？手掌手背都是肉呵！”后来，这个瑶族干部向上级作了汇报，县委就立即决定加强对后进地区的领导，使各地工作进展逐步达到平衡。
    自治县九十五个农业和林业社在去年严重旱灾考验下，农副业还略有增产，造林面积比原来增加了三倍半，每人的购买力平均由三十六元增加到四十五元。
