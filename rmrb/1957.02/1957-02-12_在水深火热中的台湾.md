Taiwan in Dire Straits

Breaking Through the 2 Billion Yuan Mark

　　The Chiang Kai-shek clique issued nearly 300 million new Taiwan dollars in Taiwan before the Spring Festival this year. Taiwan newspaper reports say that the total amount of Taiwan dollars issued for the New Year and Spring Festival has reached 500 million yuan. Thus, by the end of January, the amount of Taiwan dollars issued with a face value of one yuan or more reached 1.82 billion yuan. If auxiliary coins are included, it has exceeded the 2 billion yuan mark, once again creating a record high for the issuance of Taiwan dollars.

　　100,000 Mentally Ill Patients

　　Taiwan residents are living in difficult circumstances. Many feel that their future is bleak, and their spirits are suffering. The number of mentally ill patients in the province has now "approached the 100,000 mark!" Among them, patients in urgent need of treatment "total more than 30,000." This is all information revealed by Taiwan newspapers. Incidents of mentally ill patients committing suicide or murder are no longer news in Taiwan. On January 25, two cases of mentally ill patients committing murder occurred in Taipei City on the same day. However, the existing mental hospitals in Taiwan province have a capacity of only about 500 people, and there are few opportunities for patients to be hospitalized for treatment. In addition, the medical expenses for each person are as high as 10 Taiwan dollars per day. This cost is by no means affordable for ordinary people, so the condition of many mentally ill patients is becoming more and more serious. The "Central Daily News" exclaimed: "From a social point of view, mental illness is no longer a simple medical and public security issue, but a complex and increasingly serious social problem."

　　More Than 60,000 Criminal Cases

　　The Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Taiwan High Court" statistics show that the courts in Taiwan province accepted 60,651 criminal cases last year. Among them, theft ranked first. Murder cases and juvenile delinquency cases have both increased sharply compared with the previous year. Murder cases that occurred in the first ten months of last year alone increased by 39% compared with the same period of the previous year, and juvenile delinquency cases increased by 15%. Taiwan newspapers say that the causes of theft are "mostly due to being forced by life." Most juvenile crimes are also theft. Nanto County recently discovered a "baby theft gang" composed of six children who specialized in stealing. Later, five of them were "arrested and brought to justice." Due to the abundance of pornographic publications and the poisoning of American films, yellow cases such as love killings and rapes are also emerging in Taiwan.

　　Two and a Half Pounds of Rice "Relief Fund"

　　As usual, the Chiang Kai-shek clique boasts about the so-called "winter relief" every winter. However, according to Taiwan newspapers, the "relief fund" received by each person in Taitung County who is generally eligible for relief is only five Taiwan dollars, which can only buy two and a half pounds of rice at the current rice price in Taiwan. The Taipei "Zhengxin News" called this kind of "relief" a "formalistic" work, believing that "it is not worth such a waste of manpower and resources." Suicides due to hunger and cold are often heard of among Taiwan residents. Lai Xiuzhu, a woman from Puli Township, Nantou County, poisoned her three-year-old child to death on January 27 because she was impoverished, sick and unable to survive the year, and then committed suicide by taking poison.

    在水深火热中的台湾
    突破二十亿元大关
    蒋介石集团今年春节前夕在台湾增发了将近三亿元的新钞票。台湾报纸消息说，总计新年和春节台币发行增加数额，已达五亿元。这样，到1月底为止，一元面额以上的台币发行额，就达到了十八亿二千多万元，如果加计辅币，已突破了二十亿元的大关，再一次创造了台币发行额的最高纪录。
    十万名精神病患者
    台湾居民生活艰难，许多人都感到前途茫茫，精神蒙受刺激，全省的精神病患者现在已“接近十万大关”！而其中急需治疗的病人，也“总在三万以上”。这都是台湾报纸透露出来的消息。精神病患者自杀或杀人的事件，在台湾已不算什么新闻。在1月25日一天当中，台北市连续发生两宗精神病患者杀人案。而台湾全省现有的精神病院，只有五百人左右的容纳量，病人住院治疗的机会很少，再加上治疗时每人每天仅医药费就要台币十元。这一笔费用决非普通人所能负担，因而许多精神病患者病状愈来愈严重。“中央日报”发出惊呼：“从社会观点看，精神病已经不是一个医药和治安的单纯问题，而是一个复杂而又日趋严重的社会问题。”
    六万多件刑事案
    蒋介石集团“台湾高等法院”统计台湾去年全省各地法院受理的刑事案件达六万零六百五十一件。其中窃盗犯居第一位。谋杀案件和少年犯罪案件都比前年激增。仅去年头十个月发生的谋杀案件就比前年同期增加了39％，少年犯罪案件增加了15％。台湾报纸说，窃盗犯的成因，“大部分是迫于生活”。少年犯罪最多也是偷窃罪。南投县最近发现了一个“娃娃窃盗团”，有六个小孩组成了一个集团专事行窃，后来有五个人被“缉捕归案”。由于黄色书刊的充斥，美国影片的毒害，情杀和强奸等黄色案件在台湾也层出不穷。
    两斤半米“救济金”
    蒋介石集团每届寒冬照例吹嘘一番所谓“冬令救济”。但据台湾报纸说，台东县一般适合被救济的人，每人所得“救济金”只有台币五元，按照现在台湾的米价，只能买到大米两斤半。台北“征信新闻”把这种“救济”称之为“形式化”的工作，认为“不值得如此的劳师动众”。台湾居民因饥寒交迫自杀的时有所闻。南投县埔里镇妇女赖秀珠，因贫病交迫，难渡年关，在1月27日先毒死自己的三岁幼儿，然后自己服毒自杀。　（新华社讯）
