Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 20th - Mechanical factories in Inner Mongolia have great potential for conserving steel and guaranteeing increased production. From February 12th to 19th, representatives from various mechanical factories met in Hohhot to discuss measures for increasing production and practicing economy this year. They calculated that last year alone, the region lost more than 530 tons of steel raw materials due to high rejection rates. In addition, factories generally have problems such as failure to recover steel cuttings and product weights exceeding design standards. The representatives believe that if these areas are strengthened this year, the region can save more than 1,120 tons of steel this year.

The representatives from the various mechanical factories also studied and determined 28 methods for increasing production and practicing economy in terms of promoting advanced processing experience, utilizing substitute materials, and strengthening material and quality management. The implementation of these methods will play a significant role in guaranteeing increased production in the event of a shortage of raw materials. For example, the Ulanhot Agricultural Machinery Factory recently successfully trial-produced a new type of waterwheel, with each unit weighing 50.7 kilograms less than the waterwheels originally produced. Calculated on the basis of producing 10,000 units per year, the steel saved can increase the production of waterwheels by more than 3,900 units.

    在原材料不足的情况下保证增产
    内蒙古各机械工厂研究节约钢材措施
    据新华社呼和浩特20日电　内蒙古各地机械工厂在节约钢材、保证增产方面有很大潜力。2月12日到19日各机械厂的代表们在呼和浩特开会讨论今年增产节约的措施时计算出，去年一年因为废品率高，全区就损失钢铁原料五百三十多吨。另外，各厂还普遍存在着钢材切削不回收、产品重量超过设计标准等现象。代表们认为，今年如果在这些方面加强工作，全区今年就可以节省钢铁一千一百二十多吨。
    各个机械工厂的代表还从推广先进的加工经验、利用代用材料、加强材料和质量管理等方面，研究确定了二十八种增产节约方法。这些方法贯彻执行以后，对在原料不足的情况下保证增产将起很大作用。例如乌兰浩特农业机械厂最近试制成功一种新型的水车，每台重量比原来生产的水车减少五十点七公斤，全年按生产一万台计算，节约的钢铁可增产水车三千九百多台。
