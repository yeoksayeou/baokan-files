Yunnan Province's rural areas in over a hundred counties and cities have universally launched self-examination activities from top to bottom and from bottom to top, overcoming right-leaning sentiments and renewing the rural landscape. In the summary work, they correctly affirmed the achievements since collectivization, realistically examined the shortcomings, thereby protecting and promoting the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses.

Last year was Yunnan Province's year with the largest production increase since liberation. On the basis of collectivization, grain production increased by 15.6% compared to 1955, and the total value of agricultural output increased by about 20%, enabling more than 86% of cooperatives to increase their income and more than 85% of their members to increase their income. People's lives have also gradually improved. In the early days of liberation, the province averaged just over 500 jin of grain per person per year; last year it reached more than 700 jin. Except for a few remote areas, the poverty of mainly eating chaff and vegetables has basically ended. Facts have proven that last year's large grain increase was the result of achieving agricultural collectivization.

In many agricultural cooperatives, although most people increased their income, due to the production plans made last spring being overly ambitious, a sense of dissatisfaction with socialism arose because the planned figures could not be achieved during distribution. They could not see the superiority of the cooperatives, and a few even blamed the agricultural cooperatives for some "setbacks," saying that "income has decreased, it is better not to join the cooperative, not joining the cooperative is more 'free'." Therefore, for a period of time, the production enthusiasm of many farmers was not high, and there were many complaints.

The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party fully recognized that this voice of dissatisfaction with socialism mainly came from rich peasants, well-to-do peasants, and former small merchants. This was because, during the high tide of collectivization, they joined the cooperatives more from a political point of view. As a result of distribution, some could not increase their income, some even reduced their income, and some calculated that their legitimate income had increased, but because they could not engage in speculation or exploitation, their actual total income was less than in the past. They shouted and expressed their dissatisfaction with collectivization. At the same time, it was also discovered in many places that some landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to play double-dealing tactics in the cooperatives, stirring up trouble and creating dissatisfaction. This type of person who is truly dissatisfied with socialism generally does not exceed 10% in the agricultural cooperatives. As for the majority of farmers, they were satisfied with the agricultural cooperatives and socialism because their income had increased last year. However, because they had opinions on certain shortcomings in their work or certain problems in the style of cadres, and the rural party organizations had neglected the political and ideological education of the farmers for a considerable period of time, they had misunderstandings about certain socialist measures. Therefore, when the general well-to-do peasants shouted their dissatisfaction with socialism, some farmers also echoed their sentiments, while others stood by and watched. Some cadres and party members also showed confusion in the face of this new situation; some comrades only saw certain phenomena and swayed with the wind, failing to correctly recognize and affirm the achievements in their work, instead seeing more of the shortcomings in their work, even exaggerating these shortcomings; some, because they themselves had shortcomings in handling personal interests versus collective and national interests, or because they themselves had dissatisfaction, did not dare or were unable to effectively educate the masses and overcome the confused thinking among them. Therefore, many grassroots party committees and cadres felt great pressure for a period of time, and developed a sense of bitterness and negative right-leaning sentiments.

In order to overcome the right-leaning sentiments existing in the rural areas, the leading organs at all levels in Yunnan Province universally commended advanced individuals and carried out criticism and self-criticism, enabling cadres and the masses to distinguish between the superiority of the socialist system and the shortcomings in specific work, and to understand the nature of these shortcomings. Doing so strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, and on the basis of accepting last year's experiences and lessons, through full deliberation from top to bottom and from bottom to top, they planned this year's production plan, increased the masses' confidence in striving for increased production this year, and promoted the current production movement.

After a mass self-education movement, 80% to 90% of the masses quickly affirmed the superiority of the socialist system economically and politically; although the income of a few well-to-do farmers did not increase last year, or even decreased slightly, they quickly changed their attitude after calculating the accounts politically; and the remaining few who were truly dissatisfied with socialism, seeing that the socialist atmosphere occupied an overwhelming advantage among the masses, no longer dared to shout.

As a result of this, the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses rose, and the rural landscape was renewed. Not only was the production enthusiasm high, but the promotion of other tasks was also smooth. After a mass self-education in Dali County, the attendance rate of each agricultural cooperative increased sharply, from the original 50%-60% to 80%-90%. The Renliyi Agricultural Cooperative collected more than 300,000 jin of pine needles in a few days, repaired a ditch, improved more than 80 mu of soil, and opened up more than 100 mu of wasteland. In Yuxi, Chuxiong, Qujing, Mengzi and other places, farmers' production activities were in full swing. In Yuxi district, an average of more than 70,000 people were mobilized daily to build water conservancy projects, forming a mass upsurge of diligence and thrift in water conservancy construction. Up to now, in addition to eleven medium-sized water conservancy projects, 1,739 dams and 4,046 ditches have been built and renovated, which can increase the irrigation of more than 100,000 mu of land. In Qujing County, public grain entering storage increased from more than 1.7 million jin to more than 15 million jin in ten days; the first weeding of wheat increased from more than 39,000 mu to more than 55,000 mu. In Mengzi County, the attendance rate of the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative increased from about 40% to more than 80%, and some teams reached more than 95%.

This self-education in the form of summary work is currently continuing to deepen. This will play a significant role in striving for a greater harvest this year.

### 云南农村总结去年工作推动了当前生产  实事求是地肯定成绩，分析缺点，克服了右倾情绪，使农村面貌焕然一新

    云南农村总结去年工作推动了当前生产
    实事求是地肯定成绩，分析缺点，克服了右倾情绪，使农村面貌焕然一新
    本报讯　云南省一百多个县、市的农村里，普遍地开展了自上而下和自下而上的总结工作的活动，克服了右倾情绪，使农村面貌为之一新。在总结工作中，他们正确地肯定了合作化以来的成绩，实事求是地检查了缺点，从而保护和发扬了干部和群众的积极性。
    去年，是云南省解放以来增产最多的一年，在合作化的基础上，粮食比1955年增产15.6％，农业总产值增加20％左右，使86％以上的合作社增加了收入，85％以上的社员增加了收入。人民的生活也逐步地得到了改善。解放初期，全省每人每年平均粮食五百斤稍多一点，去年达到七百多斤。除边疆少数地区外，基本上结束了以吃糠菜为主的贫困生活。事实证明，去年粮食大增产是实现农业合作化的结果。
    在很多地区的农业社里，虽然大多数人增加了收入，可是由于去年春天订生产计划的时候，许的愿大了些，分配时达不到规划数字而产生了一种对社会主义不满的情绪。他们看不到合作社的优越性，甚至有少数人把一些“倒陷”事推到农业社身上，说什么“收入减少了，还不如不入社，不入社还可以‘自由’点”。因此，在一段时间里，不少农民的生产情绪不够饱满，怨言也很多。
    中共云南省委充分地认识到，这种对社会主义不满的声音，主要的是来自富农和富裕农民以及过去的小商贩之中。因为他们在合作化高潮中，更多地是从政治上考虑而参加了合作社的。分配结果，有的不能增加收入，有的还减少了收入，有的算正当收入是增加了，但因为不能进行投机或剥削活动，实际总收入是比过去减少了。他们叫喊，他们对合作化不满。同时，在不少地方还发现一些地主、富农在社内乘机耍两面派，拨弄是非，制造不满。这种真正对社会主义不满的人，在农业社里一般不超过10％。至于大多数农民，由于去年增加了收入，对农业社、对社会主义是满意的。但因为对某些工作中的缺点或干部作风中的某些问题有意见，而农村党组织又在相当时间里忽视了对农民的政治思想教育工作，他们对社会主义的某些措施产生了误解，因而在一般富裕农民叫喊对社会主义不满的时候，一部分农民也随声附和起来；一部分人站在一边旁观。部分干部和党员在这种新情况面前也表现了迷惑；有些同志只看到某些现象，随风摇摆，不能正确地认识和肯定工作中的成绩，而较多地看到工作中某些缺点，甚至夸大了这些缺点；有的由于自己在处理个人同集体利益和国家利益的问题上有缺点或自己也有不满情绪，不敢或不能有力地去教育群众，克服群众中的混乱思想。因此，不少基层党委和干部，在一段时间内感到压力很大，产生苦闷消极的右倾情绪。
    为了克服农村里存在着的右倾情绪，云南省各级领导机关普遍地表扬了先进人物，开展批评和自我批评，使干部和群众划清了社会主义制度的优越性和具体工作中的缺点的界限，认识了这些缺点的性质。这样做了以后，密切了干部和群众的关系，并在接受去年经验教训的基础上，通过自上而下、自下而上地充分酝酿，规划了今年的生产计划，提高了群众争取今年增产的信心，推动了当前的生产运动。
    经过群众性的自我教育运动以后，80％—90％的群众很快地就从经济上、政治上肯定了社会主义制度的优越性；少数富裕农民去年收入虽然没有增加，甚至稍有减少，从政治上算了账以后，他们也很快地转变了态度；剩下极个别的确实对社会主义不满的人，看到社会主义空气在群众中占压倒优势，他们也不敢再叫喊了。
    这样作的结果，干部和群众的情绪高涨起来了，农村面貌一新，不仅生产情绪高，其它各项工作推行也顺利了。大理县经过群众性的自我教育后，各农业社的出勤率激增，由原来的50％—60％提高到80％—90％。仁里邑农业社在几天内就收集了三十多万斤松毛，修了一条水沟，改良了八十多亩土壤，开了一百多亩荒地。玉溪、楚雄、曲靖、蒙自等地，农民生产活动热火朝天。玉溪区每天平均出动七万多人兴修水利，形成群众性的勤俭修水利的高潮。到目前止，除十一项中型水利工程以外，已经兴修、整修了一千七百三十九个坝塘和四千零四十六条水沟，可以增灌十万多亩田。曲靖县在十天内，公余粮入仓由一百七十多万斤增加到一千五百多万斤；麦子锄头道由三万九千多亩增加到五万五千多亩。蒙自县红旗农业社的出勤率由40％左右提高到80％以上，有的队达到95％以上。
    这种总结工作式的自我教育，目前正在继续深入进行。这对于争取今年更大的丰收将会起重大的作用。
