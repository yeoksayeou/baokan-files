Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The variety of Chinese exhibits participating in the Leipzig Fair, which opens in early March this year, will increase by more than 80% compared to last year. This was stated to our reporter by Xie Ling, head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, who left Beijing for Leipzig today.

He also said, "These exhibits will include many new products that China has not produced in the past, such as the 'Liberation' brand four-ton truck, produced for the first time in history."

"Among the machine tools on display, there will be more than ten new products, such as the giant Model B115 single-column planer with a planing width of 1.5 meters and a length of 6 meters, the more precise M220 internal grinder and M8225 crankshaft grinder, as well as the T54 gear shaper and T4223 gear shaving machine for manufacturing gears."

Xie Ling said, "The vast majority of the exhibits were shipped to Germany in mid-January."
