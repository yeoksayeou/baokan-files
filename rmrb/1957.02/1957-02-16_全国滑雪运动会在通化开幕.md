Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, February 15th. China's first National Skiing Championships of 1957 opened today at the ski resort on the banks of the Hunjiang River in the southeastern suburbs of Tonghua City.

    Tonghua City is an important city in the Changbai Mountain area of southeastern Jilin Province. In those years, the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, led by the Chinese Communist Party, fought arduously against the enemy in the mountains and snowy ridges on the outskirts of Tonghua City.

    Today, the mountains in the southeastern suburbs of Tonghua are still covered with white snow, and the weather is particularly clear. More than 30,000 spectators had already walked, taken large carts, or ridden sleighs from all directions to visit the games, and there were even old ladies holding their grandchildren among the audience.

    On the snowy mountains of the ski resort, colorful flags fluttered in the wind. At 1:30 p.m., 163 male, female, and juvenile skiers entered the venue. Also entering the venue were 42 young skiers who were invited to participate in the games for skiing demonstrations. These young athletes are all under the age of fifteen, the youngest being only nine years old. The audience warmly applauded and welcomed them. Subsequently, Zhu Debao, the representative of the National Sports Commission, delivered the opening speech. Yu Ke, the Deputy Governor of Jilin Province, who attended the games, also spoke.

    After the opening ceremony, the competition officially began.

    全国滑雪运动会在通化开幕
    新华社通化15日电　中国第一次举行的1957年全国滑雪运动会，今天在通化市东南郊浑江畔的滑雪场上开幕。
    通化市是吉林省东南部长白山区的一个重要城市。当年，由中国共产党领导的东北抗日联军曾经在通化市郊的群山雪岭中同敌人进行过艰苦的斗争。
    今天，通化东南郊群山上依然复盖着皑皑积雪，天气显得分外明朗。三万多观众早就步行、坐大车或坐爬犁从四处赶来参观运动会，观众里面还有抱着孙子的老太太。
    滑雪场的雪山上，彩旗迎风招展。下午一时半，一百六十三名男、女和少年、儿童滑雪运动员进入会场。进入会场的还有被邀请参加运动会作滑雪表演的四十二名少年、儿童滑雪运动员。这些少年、儿童运动员都在十五岁以下，最小的才九岁。观众对他们热烈鼓掌欢迎。随后，国家体育运动委员会代表朱德宝致了开幕词。出席这次运动会的吉林省副省长于克也讲了话。
    开幕式以后，比赛正式开始。
