    Why are Remittances Being Withheld?
    Comrade Editor:
    I am a border guard. In the army, I often send my saved allowance money home. However, every time I send money to my family, a portion of it is withheld by the Qiaoling Agricultural Cooperative of Xiaotutan Township, Liling County, Hunan Province. Not long ago, I returned home to visit relatives and heard that there was a widespread phenomenon of agricultural cooperatives in various townships of Liling County withholding remittances from soldiers. All remittances sent by soldiers to their families are sent to the agricultural cooperative where the household is located after being reviewed by the township government. The cooperative director stamps it for withdrawal and then withholds a quarter of it. Regarding these monies withheld by the agricultural cooperative, some people say that the cooperative retained it as a production fund; others say that the cooperative wants to borrow it. In any case, I think this is wrong.　Yi Jian

    为什么要扣留汇款
    编辑同志：
    我是一个边防战士。我在部队里常把节省的津贴费寄回家中。但是，我每次寄给家里的钱，都要被湖南醴陵县小兔潭乡峤岭农业社扣留一部分。不久以前，我回家探亲，听说醴陵县各乡农业社普遍有扣留军人汇款的现象。凡军人寄给家中的汇票，经乡政府审查后，一律送交该户所在的农业社，由社主任盖章取款，然后扣留四分之一。这些被农业社扣留的钱，有人说是合作社留作生产基金了；有人说合作社要借用。不管怎样，我认为这样作是不对的。　易健
