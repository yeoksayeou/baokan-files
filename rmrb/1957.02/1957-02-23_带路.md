Leading the Way
Ji Peng
	Having crossed thousands of mountains and waded through tens of thousands of streams, the surveyor explores the path forward; dense forests block out the sky, the mountain is full of green mist, lost in the mountains, not knowing where to go. He gently knocks on the window lattice of a thatched cottage, and an old man with white hair and beard comes out; the red star on the hat evokes the old man's memories, he recognizes his long-separated loved ones, the Red Army of that year. The old man leads the surveyor to rush on the mountain road, sometimes sinking into the sea of trees, sometimes floating on the top of the clouds: "When fighting the White Army, I was your guide, and when building the Yingxia Railway, I led the army again. ..."

    带路
    纪鹏踏过千重山，涉过万条
  溪，测线员探索着前进的道
  路；密林遮天，满山绿雾，迷失在丛山中，不知走
  向何处。他轻敲着一座茅屋的窗
  棂，里边走出一位须发斑白
  的老人；帽上的红星唤起老人的
  回忆，他认出久别的亲人，当
  年的红军。老人带着测线员在山路
  中奔走，忽而沉在树海，忽而浮
  现云头：“打白军时，我就是你
  们的向导，修鹰厦线时，我又给大
  军带路。……”
