    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 24th. The Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture is drawing cadres from various ethnic groups within government organizations to strengthen the leadership structures in the border areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups and to bolster production and agricultural cooperative work in these regions. Of the 107 cadres being dispatched in batches starting from the 22nd, 42 are from minority ethnic groups.

    The majority of the cadres being sent to the countryside are familiar with rural work and possess experience in leading agricultural production. Approximately one-third of them are leaders at or above the district level. After arriving in the countryside, they will assume positions such as grassroots Party committee secretaries, agricultural cooperative directors, and accountants. This will ensure that all 264 areas (each area encompassing several townships or a district) within the prefecture are staffed with a certain number of strong core personnel. For example, the heads of work teams in each area of Danzhai County are mostly county-level cadres, with a few being district Party committee secretaries.

    The Qiandongnan area is vast, with a limited number of grassroots rural cadres, particularly in the border counties of Congjiang and Liping, creating significant difficulties for the work. After the establishment of the Autonomous Prefecture in July last year, leading cadres from the Autonomous Prefecture and various counties have continuously gone deep into the border mountainous areas to understand the hardships of the masses and help township and cooperative cadres address key issues, which has had a certain positive effect. To help minority ethnic farmers in these areas develop production and simultaneously improve the capabilities of cadres through practice, the CPC Qiandongnan Prefectural Committee, drawing on past experience, began to implement this method of transferring cadres and strengthening the grassroots in mid-February to further strengthen the Party's leadership in border ethnic areas. The total number of government cadres being transferred will reach 2,521.

### 黔东南苗族侗族自治州下调干部  充实边沿地区领导力量

    黔东南苗族侗族自治州下调干部
    充实边沿地区领导力量
    新华社贵阳24日电　黔东南苗族侗族自治州抽调各族机关干部充实边沿少数民族聚居乡的领导机构，加强这些地区的生产和农业社工作。从22日开始分批下调的一百零七名干部中，有四十二名是少数民族。
    这次下乡的干部绝大多数熟悉农村工作，并且有领导农业生产的经验，其中区级以上的领导人员约占三分之一。他们下乡后将分别担任基层党委书记，农业社主任、会计等职务。这样，全州二百六十四个片（每片包括几个乡或一个区）都配有一定数量较强的骨干。如丹寨县各片的工作组长大部分是县级干部，少数是区委书记。
    黔东南地区辽阔，农村基层干部较少，特别是边沿的从江、黎平等县情况更加突出，给工作造成很大困难。去年7月建立自治州后，自治州和各县的负责干部就曾不断深入边沿山区，了解群众疾苦，帮助乡、社干部重点解决有关问题，起到一定作用。为了帮助这些地区的少数民族农民发展生产，同时在实践中提高干部才能，中共黔东南地委吸取过去的经验，从2月中旬开始采取了这种下调干部、充实基层的办法，进一步加强党对边沿民族地区的领导。下调的机关干部总计将达二千五百二十一名。
