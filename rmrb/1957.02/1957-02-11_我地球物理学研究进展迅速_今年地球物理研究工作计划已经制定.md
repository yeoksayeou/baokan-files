Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Chinese geophysical scientists held the first member representative meeting of the Chinese Geophysical Society and the inaugural meeting of the Academic Committee of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing from the 5th to the 9th. The meeting summarized the achievements of the past seven years and discussed the future work of the Society.

Geophysics is a science that has developed rapidly internationally in the last two or three decades. It studies the physical processes of the Earth's body, oceans, atmosphere, properties, states, and natural changes, including meteorology, seismology, geomagnetism, geophysical prospecting, ocean physics, and more. Before liberation, there were only forty-odd people engaged in this research in China, most of whom focused on meteorological research. Now, there are over ten thousand people engaged in this work. In addition to the further development of meteorology, research work in geophysical prospecting, seismology, and geomagnetism has also been rapidly expanded.

Now, on the vast land of the motherland, from Hainan Island to Hailar, from the Yellow Sea coast to the Pamir Plateau, more than a thousand meteorological stations have been established according to the distribution of latitude and longitude. In some important areas, dozens of seismic stations and geomagnetic stations have also been established. The equipment and instruments installed in these stations are relatively new. The level of instruments and equipment in meteorological ground stations has approached that of similar stations in the Soviet Union. These stations provide a large amount of data for scientific research every day.

Currently, the accuracy rate of short-term weather forecasts in China has reached 80%, and the accuracy rate of severe weather forecasts has exceeded 80%. In the past two years, in addition to actively preparing to use electronic computers to reform weather forecasting, meteorological scientists have also begun to study China's climate characteristics, atmospheric circulation, and large-scale weather processes in East Asia. The research results of Ye Duzheng and Gu Zhenchao on the impact of the Tibetan Plateau on the atmospheric circulation in East Asia and Chinese weather have won the third prize of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1956.

China's first set of geomagnetic maps and seismic zone maps have been completed. Geophysical scientists have sorted out thousands of years of historical data and traveled all over the major regions of the country to carry out observation work for this project.

Geophysical prospecting is a relatively new field in geophysics. China's geophysical prospecting work has developed rapidly since liberation. The number of people participating in this work has grown from dozens in the past to eight thousand.

At this representative meeting, geophysical scientists from various fields presented more than twenty papers on the above-mentioned achievements and held heated discussions on the two issues of the East Asian monsoon and seismic zone mapping.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The Chinese Geophysical Society held its first member representative meeting in Beijing from the 5th to the 9th. At this meeting, the Chinese Geophysical Society and the Academic Committee of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were established, and this year's work plan was formulated.

According to the plan, in geophysical prospecting, new instruments will be designed, the scope of application of geophysical prospecting methods will be expanded, and the work of data research will be strengthened to improve the accuracy of inferring mineral deposits. In meteorological work, it is necessary to cooperate with agricultural production planning to compile China's natural climate regionalization map and complete the technical innovation of meteorological forecasting. Geomagnetic workers will further study the laws of geomagnetic changes. Seismologists will also begin to study regional seismicity. In addition, oceanographic research will also be initiated. The plan especially emphasizes strengthening international scientific ties and doing a good job in various aspects of the International Geophysical Year.

    我地球物理学研究进展迅速
    今年地球物理研究工作计划已经制定
    据新华社9日讯　我国地球物理科学工作者于5日至9日在北京举行了中国地球物理学会第一次会员代表大会，及中国科学院地球物理研究所学术委员会成立大会，总结了七年来的工作成就，讨论了学会今后的工作。
    地球物理科学事业是近二、三十年在国际上才迅速发展起来的一门科学，它是研究地球本体、海洋、大气的性质、状态和自然变化的物理过程。包括了气象学、地震学、地磁学、地球物理探矿学、海洋物理学等。我国解放前从事这方面研究的只有四十多人，其中多数人都偏重于气象学的研究。现在从事这方面工作的已有上万人，除了气象学有了进一步发展外，在地球物理探矿、地震、地磁等方面的研究工作也以很快的速度展开了。
    现在在祖国辽阔的土地上，从海南岛到海拉尔，从黄海边到帕米尔高原，按照经纬度的分布已经建立了一千多个气象台站，并且在一些重要地区建立了几十个地震台和地磁台。这些台站里配备的设备仪器都是比较新式的，气象台地面站里的仪器设备所达到的水平已经和苏联同类型的台站所配备的仪器设备相接近。这些台站每天都为科学研究提供着大量的资料。
    现在我国短期的天气预报的准确率已达80％，危险天气预报的准确率超过了80％。最近两年来，气象科学工作者除了积极准备使用电子计算机改革天气预报工作外，还开始就我国气候特征和大气环流及东亚大型天气过程进行了研究，其中叶笃正和顾震潮所做的关于西藏高原对于东亚大气环流及中国天气的影响的研究结果，已经获得中国科学院1956年度第三等科学奖金。
    我国历史上的第一套地磁图和地震区域划分图已经完成了。地球物理科学工作者为了这项工作曾经整理了几千年的历史资料，跑遍了全国主要地区进行观测工作。
    地球物理探矿工作是地球物理科学事业中一门较新的工作。我国的地球物理探矿工作在解放后发展得很快。参加这项工作的已经从过去的几十人发展到了八千人。
    在这次代表大会上，地球物理各方面的科学工作者就上述成就宣读了二十多篇论文，并就东亚季风和地震区域划分图这两个问题进行了热烈的讨论。
    新华社9日讯　中国地球物理学会5日到9日在北京举行第一次会员代表大会，这次会上成立了中国地球物理学会和中国科学院地球物理研究所学术委员会，并且制定了今年的工作计划。
    根据计划，在地球物理探矿方面要设计新的仪器，扩大地球物理探矿方法的使用范围，同时加强资料研究工作，提高推断矿床的正确性。在气象工作上要配合农业生产规划编制我国自然气候区划图，完成气象预报的技术革新工作。地磁工作者要进一步研究地磁的变化规律。地震工作者也要着手进行区域地震的研究。另外还要开辟海洋学的研究工作。计划中特别强调加强国际科学联系，做好国际地球物理年的各项工作。
