Sights and Sounds of South America	Zhao Feng
A Typical Middle-Class Family Meal
A famous playwright and professor invited us to his home for dinner. He said, "My home is a typical Chilean middle-class home, and I'm only serving you a typical Chilean family meal. I'm inviting you as guests to my home so you can understand our life."
In the residential area near the city of Santiago, there are many gray small buildings, mostly two-story houses with four small rooms in total. The two small rooms on the ground floor are connected and total seventeen or eighteen square meters, serving as a living room and dining room. Six people crowded the dining table, and other guests sat on the sofa to eat. The host said that this was the most friendly lunch, and the more guests the better. When there are so many guests that the house cannot accommodate them, the one sitting on the stairs must be the host's closest friend.
The meal was typical Chilean cuisine: the first course was soup called "Cazuela", which is very similar to oxtail soup. The second course, called "Porotos", was meat broth stewed with yellow beans. The dessert was boiled dates and plums. This boiled fruit had a strange name when served in extra-large glasses—"Young Horse." It is said that eating this boiled fruit will make you as energetic and beautiful as a young horse. Everyone said: Indeed, this glass is extraordinarily large, holding about one liter or more. If someone can eat such a glass of boiled fruit, whether they will be as beautiful as a young horse is debatable, but it is absolutely certain that someone with such a good appetite will be as strong as a young horse.
Out of curiosity, we specifically asked the host: since he repeatedly said that this was a family meal, is this how they usually eat. The host said that the dishes were home-style; usually, having soup is enough without a second course, and having a second course may mean no soup. The host explained: generally, Chilean families cannot afford to hire maids, so housewives eat one hot dish to save trouble.
After the meal, the host, with the straightforwardness of an artist, told us: "You live in a big hotel, so you cannot understand our lives. Big hotels that specialize in entertaining foreigners are like fortresses isolated from the world. The food there is 'international cuisine,' which means it has no characteristics. The prices are also such that only those who can afford US dollars won't stick out their tongues in public. I believe you must want to know how much such a meal costs. If I go to Beijing, I would also like to know these things. Approximately, eating like this every month would cost a person about two or three thousand pesos (Chilean currency). And at the big hotel where you live, this amount of money is only enough for two days."
On the way back, the driver of the car we hired asked us to allow him to stop by his home. Because we gave him tickets for the evening's performance, he wanted to tell his wife and daughter as soon as possible. This taxi driver's home was a set of three bungalows, which were kept very clean. But when we asked about his life, he also complained. He said: his profession is a good profession, and he can earn seven or eight thousand pesos a month. But the rent is very expensive, three rooms cost three thousand pesos, and feeding a family of five costs at least four or five thousand pesos a month. And his younger brother is an ordinary worker, with only four thousand pesos a month, so it is difficult to support a family.
Classical and Modern Dance Dramas
In Chile, as in Europe, dancers everywhere are debating the following questions: How should we view classical dance dramas? Are there significant limitations to the expressive methods of classical dance dramas? What is the significance of the innovations in modern dance dramas? ...
The Dance Drama Research Department of the Music and Art Department of the University of Chile performed two typical creations for the Chinese guests: "The Clown" and "The Green Table." These are works from two different schools of dance drama. The former uses more classical methods, while the latter uses more modern methods.
Proponents of the modern school believe that although the techniques of classical dance dramas have reached a relatively high level of development, the stereotyped and formalized movements restrict expression. But supporters of the classical school believe that the modern school has too weak a technical foundation, and breaks the formalized methods of classical dance dramas too much. In particular, "liberating" the toes—that is, not using the toes to support the whole body—also loses many beautiful shapes that only dance dramas possess, which is not worth the loss.
The choreographer of "The Clown," performed by Chilean dancers, is Uzov, the artistic director of the Dance Research Department of the University of Chile. The music was written by Johann Strauss. The plot is very simple, just like the title of the music: two clowns, circus work, and dreams of their own circus. The opening is the performance of two clowns, followed by their observation of the circus performance. All the thrilling performances are cleverly imitated by these observers. The show ends, and the two clowns dream of managing an ideal circus, where outstanding artists perform wonderful circus acts.
"The Green Table" has realistic significance, and won the first prize in the Paris International Theater Competition in 1949. The choreographer is Jooss, and the composer is Cohen. Scene 1: Gentlemen in black suits discuss and argue at a meeting... The solution to the dispute—war. Scene 2: Death calls on young people to enlist in the army, and those enlisting say goodbye to their loved ones. Scene 3: War, and Death triumphs. Scene 4: A soldier's mother finds peace in the arms of Death, and the soldier's lover rejects the "kindness" of a speculator who makes a fortune from the war. Scene 5: Special forces—murderers of women. Scene 6: Music room—the last kiss of the soldier's lover. Scene 7: March of the Dead. Scene 8: Gentlemen in black suits, start discussing and arguing at the meeting again....
It can be said that these two famous creations have found their own suitable themes for expression. The former uses the elegant techniques of classical dance drama to express the possibility of using stylized movements to imitate various postures and gestures extensively. The latter uses strong, exaggerated rhythms of movement to try to express the themes of modern life.

    南美见闻	赵沨
    中产者之家的家常便饭
    一位著名的戏剧家、教授请我们到他家里吃饭，他说：“我的家是典型的智利中产者之家，请你吃的仅是典型的智利家常便饭。为了使你们了解我们的生活，才邀请你们作为我家的客人。”
    在圣地亚哥市区近郊的住宅区，有着许多灰色的小楼房，大多是楼上楼下共四小间的房子。楼下相通的两小间共有十七、八平方公尺，分作客厅和餐室。六个人就挤满了餐桌，另外的客人便坐在沙发上用餐。主人说，这是最友好的午餐，客人越多越好。在客人多到房子里容纳不下时，坐在楼梯上的一定是主人最亲密的朋友。
    饭菜是典型的智利菜：第一道是汤，叫做“卡瑞拉”，很像牛尾浓汤。第二道叫“波洛托”的是肉汤煨黄豆。尾食是煮枣子和李子。这种煮水果用特大的玻璃杯子装起来时有一个奇怪的名字——“年轻的马”。据说，意思是吃了这种煮水果便会像年轻的马那么有活力和美丽。大家说：的确，这玻璃杯大得出奇，大约可以装一公升还要多些，如果谁能吃这么一杯煮水果，是不是会像年轻的马那么美丽当然还可以讨论，然而有这么好的胃口的人一定会像一匹年轻的马那么有力气这一点倒是绝对不需要怀疑的了。
    因为好奇，我们特别向主人打听了一下：既然主人再三说这是家常便饭，是不是主人们平时也这么吃法。主人说，菜是家常做法；平常，有了汤就可以不要第二道菜了，有了第二道菜也许就不要汤。主人解释说：一般智利人家不能雇用女仆，主妇们为了省事，吃饭能有一道热菜也就够了。
    饭后，主人又以艺术家特有的爽直告诉我们说：“你们住在大旅馆里，是无法了解我们的生活的。专门招待外国人的大旅馆，像一个与世隔绝的堡垒，那里的饭菜是“国际菜”，就是说不具有任何特点了。价格也是只有付得起美金的人才不至于不当众吐出舌头来。我相信，你们一定想知道吃这么一顿饭要用多少钱。如果我去北京，我也想知道这些。大约，每月像这样吃饭的话，一个人要用二、三千比索（智币名）的样子。而在你们住的大旅馆，这笔钱最多只够吃上两天。”
    归途，我们包用的汽车的司机要求我们允许他到自己的家中湾一湾。因为，我们送给他当晚的戏票，他要尽早告诉自己的妻子和女儿。这位出租汽车的司机的家有着一组三间的平房，收拾得倒很干净。但当我们问及他的生活时，他也诉起苦来了。他说：他的职业是个好职业，每月可以收入七、八千比索。但房租很贵，三间房用去三千比索，一家五口人吃饭，最低每月也要四、五千比索。而他的弟弟是个普通工人，每月才有四千比索的收入，那便很难养家了。
    古典舞剧和现代舞剧
    在智利，也正像在欧洲一样，到处的舞蹈家总是争论着如下的一些问题：怎样看待古典舞剧？古典舞剧的表现方法是否有着很大的局限性？现代舞剧的革新有着什么样的意义？……
    智利大学音乐艺术系的舞剧研究室专为中国客人表演了他们的两个典型的创作：“小丑”和“绿桌子”。这正是舞剧的两个不同学派的作品。前者较多地运用古典的方法，而后者则较多地采用现代的方法。
    现代学派的主张者认为古典舞剧的技术虽然得到了较高度的发展，但已经定型的程式化的动作使表现上受到了拘束和局限。但古典学派的拥护者则认为现代学派在技术上根基太薄，而且过多地打破古典舞剧的程式方法，特别是“解放”了脚尖——即不用脚尖支持全身的同时，也丧失了许多只有舞剧才具有的美的造型，这是得不偿失的。
    智利的舞蹈家表演的“小丑”编舞者是乌佐夫，智利大学舞蹈研究室的艺术指导。音乐是约翰·斯特劳斯写的。剧情很简单，正如音乐的题目一样：两个小丑，马戏场的工作，自己的马戏班的梦想。开场是两个丑角的表演，以后是他们在旁观马戏场的表演，一切惊险的表演都由这旁观者们巧妙地模仿出来了。散场了，两个丑角在梦中幻想着自己管理着一个理想的马戏班，这个马戏班的卓越的艺术家们进行着精彩的马戏表演。
    “绿桌子”的题材有着现实的意义，因而1949年曾得到巴黎的国际戏剧比赛的第一奖。编舞者是朱斯，作曲是柯因。第一景：黑礼服的绅士们在会议上讨论、争论……解决争论的办法——战争。第二景：死神号召青年们去从军，从军者和亲人告别。第三景：战争，死神胜利了。第四景：士兵的母亲在死神的臂中找到了和平，士兵的爱人拒绝了发战争财的投机者的“仁慈”。第五景：别动队——妇女的屠杀者。第六景：音乐餐室——士兵的爱人的最后的一吻。第七景：死的进行曲。第八景：黑礼服的绅士们，在会议上又开始了讨论、争论……。
    这两个著名的创造可以说都找到了各自适合的表现方式的题材了。前者用优美的古典舞剧的技巧表现了广泛的用程式化的动作来模拟各种姿态和身段的可能。后者用强烈、夸张的动作节奏尝试着表现了现代生活的主题。　　（未完）（附图片）
