    Why did internal Party documents end up in the hands of a controlled person?
    Editor:
    In late January, when the household registration police of the Guangfusi Street Police Station of the Yimiao District Public Security Bureau in Shanghai were checking household registrations, they found 236 pieces of various internal Party documents and notebooks, weighing sixteen pounds, in the home of a controlled person. Most of these documents and materials were from 1956. The units that issued these documents included the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jingjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jingjiang County People's Committee, and the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League. The content of the documents covered a wide range of issues.
    How did such a large number of documents end up in the hands of a controlled person? It turned out that Xu, a farmer from the Second Village of Majing Township, Jingjiang County, collected old books and newspapers in the countryside and sold them in Shanghai because of financial difficulties. He also met this controlled person. The responsible comrade of the township learned about Xu's selling of old books and newspapers. On January 13th of this year, the responsible comrade of the township said to Xu, "I have some old paper to sell to you." The next day, Xu went to the home of the responsible comrade of the township, who had enthusiastically sorted out the "old paper" in advance. After weighing it, it was sold to Xu at a price of 12 cents per pound, and Xu transported it to Shanghai and resold it to the controlled person.
    The responsible comrade of Majing Township, in order to pursue petty gains, actually lost political vigilance and did not hesitate to sell confidential documents, which is really intolerable. I suggest that the relevant units earnestly strengthen confidentiality education for them.　　　　　Li Jianzhong

### 党内文件为什么会到了被管制分子手里？

    党内文件为什么会到了被管制分子手里？
    编辑同志：
    1月下旬，上海市邑庙区公安分局广福寺街派出所户籍警在查户口时，在一个被管制分子家里发现各种党内文件、记事本二百三十六件，重达十六斤。这些文件、材料大多是1956年的。印发这些文件的有中共江苏省委、中共扬州地委、中共靖江县委、靖江县人民委员会、青年团扬州地委等单位。文件内容涉及的问题很广泛。
    这样大量的文件怎么会到了被管制分子的手里呢？原来靖江县马静乡二村农民徐某，因为生活困难，就在乡间收集旧书报到上海贩卖，并结识了这个被管制分子。徐某贩卖旧书报的事，给该乡负责同志知道了。今年1月13日，乡负责同志对徐说：“我有些旧纸卖给你。”次日，徐至乡负责同志家，乡负责同志兴致冲冲地早就把“旧纸”整理好了。过秤后，以一角二分一斤的价格卖给了徐，徐贩运到上海，转卖给了被管制分子。
    马静乡负责同志为了贪图小便宜，竟然丧失政治警惕性，不惜去出卖机密文件，这实在令人不能容忍。我建议有关单位对他们切实加强保密的教育。　　　　　李健忠
