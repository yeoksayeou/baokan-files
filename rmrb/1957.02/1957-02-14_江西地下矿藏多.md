Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 12th: More than a year of geological prospecting has proved that Jiangxi Province has rich mineral resources.

	A "fine vein disseminated" copper deposit (also known as porphyry copper deposit) discovered in northeastern Jiangxi Province has a wide distribution area and relatively uniform grade variation. A lead-zinc deposit has also been found in this area. In the southwestern part of Jiangxi Province, many new tungsten deposits and seven or eight promising reserve bases for metal minerals have also been found, including lead, zinc, molybdenum, and scheelite.

	The Fengcheng and Leping coal mining areas in northeastern Jiangxi Province have been proven to be large coalfields with industrial value. The reserves of the Xiangu Ridge, Meixian Ridge, and Lesheli coalfields in the Fengcheng area can be mined for more than 50 years based on the production capacity of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau last year. The Mingshan, Qiaotouqiu, and Guanmuling coalfields in the Leping area have seven minable coal seams, the thickest of which is about four meters. The reserves of industrial and civilian coal already found in the Qingshan mining area of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau and the Huagushan area, which is 100 li away from Pingxiang Town, are also very abundant.

    江西地下矿藏多
    新华社南昌12日电　经过地质勘探人员一年多的勘探证明，江西省有丰富的矿藏。
    在江西东北部发现的一个“细脉浸染型”铜矿（又名斑状铜矿），分布面较广，品位变化比较均匀。在这个地区还找到了一个铅锌矿。在江西西南部地区还找到了许多新的钨矿产地和七、八处有希望的金属矿产后备基地，其中已经知道的有铅、锌、钼和白钨等。
    江西东北部丰城、乐平煤矿区，经勘探证明都是具有工业价值的较大煤田。丰城区的仙姑岭、梅仙岭、?社里三个煤田的储量，按萍乡矿务局去年的生产能力计算，可以开采五十年以上。乐平区的鸣山、桥头丘、官木岭的煤田，有可采煤层七层，最厚的煤层约有四公尺。萍乡矿务局青山矿区和离萍乡镇一百里的花鼓山地区，已经找到的工业用煤和民用煤的藏量也很丰富。
