    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 27th: Marosán, member of the Executive Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of State, spoke to more than a thousand party and non-party worker activists in Dunaújváros on the afternoon of the 25th.

    Marosán criticized certain Hungarian writers for attempting to negate the role of Communist Party members.

    Speaking of the struggle against counter-revolutionaries, he said that the biggest mistake of the past leadership was the failure to establish a serious dictatorship of the proletariat. However, counter-revolutionaries should not think that what the past leadership failed to do, we will also fail to do. We will have a serious dictatorship of the proletariat, and no one will be allowed to oppose socialism.

    Marosán also said that the government supports the workers' councils, but the composition of some workers' councils still needs to be further purified. There are still some reactionaries hiding in the workers' councils, and they are working according to the instructions of Western radio stations.

    Regarding the restoration of domestic order, Marosán particularly praised the contributions of the miners. He also said that the counter-revolutionaries are failing step by step, and in the end they even wanted to instigate the university students. But the university students will gradually understand.

    Marosán pointed out that some mistakes had been made in the past in treating education workers, primarily the lack of concern for their material treatment. The government is now correcting this mistake. The government also requires education workers to educate children in the socialist spirit. It is wrong to say that we do not value intellectuals; the working class cares about the growth of its own intellectuals.

    马罗山在多瑙潘泰莱城向群众讲话
    匈牙利要加强无产阶级专政
    据新华社布达佩斯27日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党执行委员会委员、国务部长马罗山，25日下午在多瑙潘泰莱城向一千多个党和非党工人积极分子讲了话。
    马罗山指责匈牙利某些作家企图否定共产党员的作用。
    在谈到和反革命分子进行斗争时，他说，过去领导的最大的错误就是没有建立认真的无产阶级专政，但是反革命分子不要以为过去领导所没有做到的，我们也做不到。我们将有认真的无产阶级专政，不允许任何人反对社会主义。
    马罗山还说，政府是支持工人委员会的，但是某些工人委员会的成分还需要进一步纯洁，工人委员会中还隐藏有一些反动分子，他们是按照西方电台的指示来工作的。
    在恢复国内秩序方面，马罗山特别赞扬了矿工们的贡献。他又说，反革命分子步步失败，最后他们还想挑拨大学生们。但是大学生也是会渐渐明白的。
    马罗山指出，过去对待教育工作者犯过一些错误，首先是对他们的物质待遇太不关心，现在政府正在纠正这个错误。政府也要求教育工作者们以社会主义精神教育孩子。说我们不重视知识分子是不对的，工人阶级关心着自己的知识分子的成长。
