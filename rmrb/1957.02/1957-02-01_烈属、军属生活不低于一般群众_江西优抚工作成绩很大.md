Xinhua News Agency Report: Jiangxi Province achieved great success in its preferential treatment work last year.

	In most rural areas of the province, the "preferential labor day" method replaced the previous system of cultivation on behalf of families. According to statistics from more than 40 counties including Ruijin and Suichuan, 30%-40% of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers enjoyed "preferential labor days," ensuring that their living standards were no lower than that of the average person. Agricultural cooperatives also arranged some light labor for families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers who lacked labor, based on specific circumstances. Zhou Nian-shou and her daughter-in-law in Yaochi Township, Yujiang County, worked more than 70 labor days in a year. The cooperative subsidized them with 120 "preferential labor days," earning them a total income of more than 200 yuan, which enabled them to live a good life. For families of martyrs and families of soldiers whose lives were still difficult after production arrangements and "preferential labor days," the government promptly issued 2.26 million yuan in subsidies. Last year, retroactive pensions were also provided to families of martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the revolution but had not received compensation.

	Jiangxi Province also paid special attention to the work of preferential treatment in the old revolutionary base areas. After the Fifth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Jiangxi Province last year, various localities convened representatives' meetings of old cadres from the old revolutionary base areas during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, taking the special district or county as a unit. They conveyed the resolutions of the Party Congress to them and listened to their opinions. Special relief funds were also distributed to the people in the old revolutionary base areas to help them solve their livelihood difficulties.

	In addition to the party organizations and government leaders visiting local families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers during festivals, preferential treatment groups from some schools and agricultural cooperatives across the province often carried water, chopped firewood, cooked meals, and cleaned houses for them, helping them solve difficulties in their daily lives.

    烈属、军属生活不低于一般群众
    江西优抚工作成绩很大
    新华社讯　江西省去年的优抚工作取得了很大成绩。
    全省大部分农村地区以“优待劳动日”的办法代替过去的代耕制度。据瑞金、遂川等四十多县的统计，有30％—40％的烈属、军属和革命残废军人享受了“优待劳动日”，保证了他们生活不低于一般群众。农业社也根据具体情况为缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属和革命残废军人安排了一些轻微的劳动。余江县瑶池乡周年寿婆媳两人一年共做了七十多个劳动日，社里又补助她们一百二十个“优待劳动日”，共收入二百多元，生活过得很好。对一些安排了生产和享受了“优待劳动日”后生活仍有困难的烈属、军属，政府及时发放了烈属、军属补助费二百二十六万元。去年还为为革命牺牲而没有得到抚恤的烈士家属做了追恤。
    江西省还特别注意革命老根据地的优抚工作。去年中共江西省第五次代表大会后，各地纷纷以专区或县为单位，召开了第二次国内革命战争时期老根据地老干部代表会，向他们传达党代表大会会议的决议，听取他们的意见。对老根据地人民还发放特殊救济款来帮助他们解决生活困难。
    各地除了每逢节日有党组织和政府的负责人向当地烈属、军属和革命残废军人进行慰问外，全省还有一些学校、农业社的优抚小组，经常为他们挑水、砍柴、做饭和打扫房屋，帮助他们解决日常生活中的困难。
