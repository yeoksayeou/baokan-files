    A Stubborn Deal
    Germany　Heinrich Heine
    In a provincial town in Hungary, there was an old man named Soller. A light cavalry regiment was stationed in that town. Old Soller often lent money to the officers of the light cavalry regiment, and also helped them buy and sell goods. The officers not only liked him very much, but also trusted him. They trusted him to such an extent that no matter who was transferred to another defense area, they would always look for old Soller, year after year.
    Once, a young officer who had been transferred to a distant place suddenly needed cash urgently. He had a very valuable ancestral antique ring, and decided to sell it to tide him over. Needless to say, the person he was looking for was none other than old man Soller. No sooner said than done. He put the ring in an old red leather bag and sent it to the lender, with a firm note: "Enclosed is an ancestral antique ring. If you can remit three thousand guilders, the ring is yours. Otherwise, please return the original item. No counter-offers, I am unwilling to reduce it by even a penny."
    Two days later, a telegram arrived: Your item is not worth three thousand, the most I can offer is two thousand. The officer immediately telegraphed back: Price is three thousand, no counter-offers.
    On the third day, the old man sent another telegram to continue negotiating: "Willing to offer two thousand five hundred. Absolutely cannot increase any further."
    The officer telegraphed back: "Ring is priced at three thousand. No counter-offers. Please return the original item immediately."
    Two days later, the officer received a small package from the post office. He opened the package and found the red leather bag, the mouth of the bag was sealed and lacquered as before. There was also a letter with the following content:
    "Lieutenant! I hereby inform you in the capacity of an expert that this ring is really not worth three thousand. Even if you search the globe, you will hardly find such a high price. I can offer at most two thousand eight hundred guilders, which is already considering your difficulties. If you are willing to sell at this price, you can send it back without opening the leather bag, and the payment will be remitted the next day. If you are unwilling to sell at the price of two thousand eight, then please keep your item, I do not intend to buy it."
    The officer was very angry reading this letter. However, he decided not to sell the ring at a reduced price. He opened the leather bag: there was no ring inside, but a small note: "Okay, let's say three thousand!"

    一笔固执的交易
    德国　亨利希·海涅
    匈牙利某省城里有个叫索勒的老头儿。那城里驻扎着一团轻骑兵。索勒老头常向轻骑兵团的军官们放债，兼带着还代他们买卖物品。军官们对他不光是很喜欢，而且也很信任。他们信任他到了这种地步：不论谁一旦被调往另外的防地之后，有什么事总还是找老索勒，多少年如一日。
    有一回，一位被调到远地某处的青年军官，忽然急需现款。他手头有一只很值钱的家传古老戒指，决定卖掉它来救急。不用问，他要找的不是别人，正是老头儿索勒。说办就办。他把戒指装在一个红色的旧皮袋里寄给那位放债的人，附了一封口气坚决的短信：“随信寄上家传古老戒指一枚。如能汇下三千古尔盾，戒指可归足下。否则盼将原物退回。还价免议，吾不愿减让分文也。”
    隔了两天，来了这么一个电报：尊物不值三千，最多能出两千。军官立刻回电：价三千，还价免议。
    第三天，老头儿又打来一个电报继续议价：“愿出二千五。决难再增。”
    军官回电说：“戒指定价三千。还价免议。原物立盼退回。”
    又过了两天，军官收到邮局送来的一个小包裹。他将包裹打开，发现了那只红色皮袋，袋口的捆扎和漆印完好如初。另外还有一封信，内容如下：
    “中尉足下！本人谨以行家身分奉告，此戒指实不值三千。尊驾访遍全球亦难求如许重价。本人充其极能出二千八百古尔盾，即此已是体念足下困难。如愿照此价出售，可勿庸开启皮袋，原装寄下，次日当将款汇至。若不愿以二千八之价出售，则请仍留尊物，吾不拟购也。”
    军官念着这封信心里大为生气。可是，他决意不将戒指削价出让。他打开了皮袋：里面没有戒指，却有个小纸条：“好吧，就算三千！”
