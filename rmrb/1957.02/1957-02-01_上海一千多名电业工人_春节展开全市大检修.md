Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. More than one thousand technical workers from the Shanghai Electric Power Administration will, after midnight tonight, conduct a large-scale Spring Festival overhaul of the city's main power generation and supply equipment. This overhaul will pay particular attention to tapping the potential for saving electricity. In the Hunan area, where the voltage was originally insufficient, the voltage will be adjusted during the Spring Festival; after the adjustment, it is estimated that about 90,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved annually from line losses.

During the Spring Festival, more than forty overhead and underground high-voltage transmission and distribution lines throughout the city will be tested for high voltage and preventatively repaired in rotation. The installation of various lightning and bird protection equipment was completed one month earlier than last year to ensure a safe power supply during this spring's thunderstorms. Last year, Shanghai suffered more than one hundred accidents due to lightning strikes, causing considerable losses in production.

At the same time, many steel mills, machinery factories, textile factories, and some light industrial factories in Shanghai will also conduct overhauls of various power equipment that are normally impossible to shut down for maintenance during the Spring Festival. More than ten factories, including the Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory, which have transformer equipment, are also preparing to save electricity by adjusting transformer capacity.

    上海一千多名电业工人
    春节展开全市大检修
    新华社上海30日电　上海电业管理局一千多个技术工人，在今天午夜以后，将对全市主要的发电、供电设备进行一次大规模的春节检修工作。这次检修将特别注意挖掘节约用电的潜力。原来电压不足的沪南地区，在春节里将要把电压作一次调整；调整以后，预计每年可以节约在路线中损耗的电九万度左右。
    全市四十多条架空的、地下的高压输电跟配电线路，春节期间要轮流做高压的测定和预防性的修理。各种防雷、防鸟设备的装置，今年比去年提早了一个月，以保证今年春天打雷时安全供电。去年上海曾经因为雷击发生了一百多次事故，使生产受到不少的损失。
    与此同时，上海许多钢铁厂、机械厂、纺织厂和一些轻工业工厂，春节期间，对各种平时无望停电检修的用电设备，也要进行检修。备有变压设备的上海电焊机厂等十多个工厂，还准备用调整变压器容量的方法来节约用电。
