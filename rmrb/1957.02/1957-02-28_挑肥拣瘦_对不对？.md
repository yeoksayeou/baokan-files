Is "Picking the Fat and Shunning the Lean" Right?
Kong Sang

On February 16th, the first page of the Shanxi Daily published two articles with opposing viewpoints. One was written by Han Run, a foreman from the second processing workshop of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, titled: "What Can I Do When No One Wants to Do 'Lean Work'?" The other was written by Wang Bingde, a worker from the same workshop, titled: "Can You Blame Me for 'Picking the Fat and Shunning the Lean'?"

The foreman said: Since the implementation of the piece-rate wage system, some workers, when encountering "fat work," come early and leave late, skipping meals, and even working overtime when not required; but when encountering "lean work" with no "gravy," they are absent or feign illness, only returning to work when there is "fat work." If all workers "pick the fat and shun the lean," who will do the "lean work"? How can the state plan be fulfilled?

Worker Wang Bingde believes: Due to the unreasonable time quotas for products and parts, workers' incomes vary greatly; moreover, the group leader distributes work "unfairly," not setting a good example. Anyone who doesn't "pick the fat and shun the lean" will suffer. Therefore, he shouldn't be blamed for "picking the fat and shunning the lean."

It seems each has their own reason, and they can't agree. To improve the understanding of employees and improve enterprise management, the Shanxi Daily published an editorial on the same day, calling on all employees in the province to discuss this issue. As far as I know, the phenomenon of "picking the fat and shunning the lean" also exists in some industrial enterprises in other provinces and cities. Therefore, I would like to share some of my views on this issue.

There are objective reasons for some workers "picking the fat and shunning the lean," which is what Comrade Wang Bingde pointed out. Because if there were no "fat" and "lean" distinctions in product and part time quotas, no one would "pick" or "choose." Even if the time quotas are unreasonable, if the person assigning tasks can "treat everyone equally," without being "unfair," and ensure that everyone gets a mix of "fat" and "lean" work, the workers would be much more content. Therefore, from the perspective of enterprise leadership, efforts should be made to eliminate the phenomenon of unreasonable quotas and improve ideological style, treating all workers equally.

However, because different products and different parts have different values, some are easier to produce and some are more difficult, and management cadres lack experience in quota work, the phenomenon of "fat" and "lean" time quotas is unavoidable. When these objective reasons still exist, is it right for everyone to "pick the fat and shun the lean"? It is not right. Because unreasonable quotas and poor cadre style are internal problems of the enterprise. We workers are the masters of the enterprise and should treat internal shortcomings with a master's attitude. On the one hand, we should actively offer criticism and suggestions to overcome the shortcomings. If the leadership does not accept them, we can report to higher-level leading bodies and request help in resolving the issues. On the other hand, until the problem is resolved, we should actively complete the assigned production tasks and not simply refuse to work when encountering "lean" work. This is like a family; everyone shouldn't just refuse to do housework because one person is poor at handling household affairs.

The key lies in the position from which one views the problem. Those who sit in the position of master first think about how to complete the production tasks, and how to save raw materials, tools, and equipment for the country in the process of completing the production tasks. They also criticize unreasonable time quotas and poor leadership style, but for the sake of safeguarding national interests and stimulating everyone's production enthusiasm. On the other hand, those who sit in a non-master position think the opposite. They have little or no thought for national and enterprise interests. Whether the Party and the People's Government call for increased production or saving, everything is for them to earn more money, more bonuses, or, as some workers in the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory openly stated: "We must fight for two 'guo you rou' (referring to bonuses) every day!" To earn more money, they not only "pick the fat and shun the lean," but also, not satisfied with picking the "fat," secretly and "automatically" work overtime, regardless of damage to equipment and tools, and pursue quantity over product quality. Their "bonuses" are obtained by sacrificing national interests. The more people like this there are among the workers, the more detrimental it is to our socialist cause. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels of enterprises should not give up in the face of those who "pick the fat and shun the lean," but patiently educate them and help them put their butts in the position of master.

    “挑肥拣瘦”对不对？
    孔桑
    2月16日山西日报第一版发表了两篇意见针锋相对的文章。一篇是太原矿山机器厂第二加工车间工段长韩润写的，题目是：“‘瘦活’没人干叫我怎么办？”另一篇是这个工段的工人王秉德写的，题目是：“这能怨我‘挑肥拣瘦’吗？”
    工长说：实行计件工资制以后，有些工人遇到“肥活”，就早来迟走不吃饭，不让加班也加班；遇上没“油水”的“瘦活”，就旷工、装病，直到有了“肥活”才上工。如果工人都“挑肥拣瘦”，那末“瘦活”叫谁干？国家计划又怎么完成呢？
    工人王秉德则认为：由于产品、零件工时定额不合理，工人收入悬殊很大；小组长分配活时又“偏三向四”，不以身作则，谁不“挑肥拣瘦”谁就会吃亏。所以，不能怨他“挑肥拣瘦”。
    这真是公说公有理，婆说婆有理，两人尿不到一个壶里去。为了提高职工们的认识和改进企业管理工作，山西日报同日发表了一篇社论，号召全省职工就这个问题开展讨论。据我了解，“挑肥拣瘦”现象，在别的省、市的一些工业企业里也有。所以，我想讲一点对这个问题的看法。
    有些工人“挑肥拣瘦”，有其客观原因，那就是王秉德同志所指出的。因为如果没有产品、零件工时定额的“肥”和“瘦”之分，也就不会有人“挑”和“拣”了。即使工时定额不合理，要是分配任务的人做到“一碗水端平”，不“偏三向四”，使大伙干的活有“肥”又有“瘦”，工人们也会心平气和得多。所以，从企业的领导方面说，应该努力消除定额不合理的现象，要改进思想作风，对所有工人一视同仁。
    不过，因为不同产品、不同零件的价值就有大和小之分，有比较好生产和比较难生产之分，再加上管理干部缺乏定额工作经验，工时定额的“肥”和“瘦”现象，是难免的。当这些客观原因还存在的时候，大家“挑肥拣瘦”对不对呢？不对。因为定额不合理，干部作风不好，是企业内部的问题，我们工人是企业的主人翁，就应以主人翁的态度来对待内部缺点。我们一方面积极提出批评，提出克服缺点的意见，要是领导上不接受，可以向上级领导机关反映，请求帮助解决。一方面，在问题没有解决以前，还应该积极完成分配的生产任务，不应该遇到“瘦”活就躺倒不干。这好比一个家庭里，全家人不能因为一个人处理家务有缺点就躺倒不干活。
    关键在于坐在什么位子上来看问题。坐在主人翁位子上的人，首先想到的是怎样完成生产任务，在完成生产任务中怎样为国家节约原材料，节约工具和设备。他们对不合理的工时定额，对不良的领导作风也提出批评，但为的是维护国家利益，发挥大家的生产积极性。而坐在非主人翁的位子上的人则相反。他们没有或者很少想到国家利益、企业利益，党和人民政府号召增产也好，节约也好，对他们说来，一切都是为了个人多拿钱，多拿奖金，或者像太原重型机器厂有的工人所公开提出的那样：“每日要为两个‘过油肉’（指奖金）而奋斗！”他们为了多赚钱，不只“挑肥拣瘦”，并且挑了“肥”还不满足，还要偷偷地‘自动’加班加点，不顾设备和工具的损坏，不顾产品质量地追求产品数量。他们的“奖金”，是以牺牲国家利益的方法得来的。这一种人在工人中越多，对于我国的社会主义事业越不利。所以，企业的各级领导干部也不要在“挑肥拣瘦”的人面前躺倒，而要耐心地教育他们，帮助他们把屁股坐到主人翁的位子上来。
