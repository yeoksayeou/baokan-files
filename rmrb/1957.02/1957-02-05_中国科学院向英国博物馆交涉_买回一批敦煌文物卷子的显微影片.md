Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd – The Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has purchased a batch of microfilms of Dunhuang cultural relic scrolls from the British Museum. These Chinese Dunhuang cultural relic scrolls were cheaply swindled away by the British archaeologist Stein fifty-six years ago.

This batch of microfilms contains more than six thousand nine hundred documents, most of which are handwritten copies of the Four Books and Five Classics, literary works, Buddhist scriptures, and Taoist scriptures by intellectuals and Buddhists of the Tang Dynasty. There are also historical facts recorded by people of all classes at that time, as well as scientific, technical, and geographical data. According to preliminary analysis, there is a considerable amount of material that researchers of Dunhuang studies in our country have not seen before.

Buddhist scriptures account for a large proportion of this batch of scrolls. In addition to some lost classics, there are also many Buddhist scripture "bianwen." "Bianwen" are stories about Buddhism compiled in popular language by Buddhists during the Tang Dynasty. Popular writing in Chinese Buddhist literature originated at that time, and it had a great influence on popular writing after the Tang Dynasty. In the past, researchers of Dunhuang documents only knew of eighty bianwen, but now six more have been discovered from this batch of scrolls, and the contents are occasionally more complete. In addition, several new yazuo texts were also discovered. Yazuo texts are opening remarks used by Buddhists before lecturing on bianwen, and only eight were known in the past.

There are also some historical materials recording the political changes of the Tang Dynasty, such as the situation during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang when various regional warlords rose up to claim kingship, and the struggle between the Tuyuhun, Tubo, Uyghur and other ethnic groups and the Tang Dynasty for the western region of Gansu. The process of Huang Chao's leadership of the peasant uprising and its failure. There are many materials that have not been seen in our historical data before.

In addition, there are some social data from that time, such as household registrations and land distribution registers from the Western Liang to the Song Dynasty (approximately from 405 AD to 987 AD), as well as contracts for buying and selling people, houses, land, livestock, and borrowing cloth, grain. From this, we can see the exploitation of the working people by the landlords at that time.

Among these scrolls, there is also a complete "Record of the Journey to the Western Heaven," which records the countries and distances traveled by Buddhists from Luoyang via Xi'an and Xinjiang, then over the Pamir Plateau to central India.

In addition to some relatively complete handwritten copies of Tang poetry collections and novels, the literary works in this batch of scrolls also include a "Memorial to the Donkey" with a very unique theme, humorous content, and beautiful language, as well as a lengthy vernacular novel "Confucius and Xiang Tuo's Dialogue," and the "Han Qin Hu Vernacular Story."

The Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has now organized manpower to sort out these materials and compile a catalog. They will soon be available for loan for research in various fields.

### 中国科学院向英国博物馆交涉  买回一批敦煌文物卷子的显微影片

    中国科学院向英国博物馆交涉
    买回一批敦煌文物卷子的显微影片
    新华社3日讯　中国科学院图书馆向英国博物馆购买了一批敦煌文物卷子的显微影片。我国的敦煌文物卷子是五十六年前被英国考古学者斯坦因廉价骗走的。
    这批显微影片共有六千九百多件文件，多数是唐代知识分子和佛教徒手抄的四书五经、文学作品、佛经、道经，也有当时各阶层人民纪录的历史事实，科学、技术、地理等资料。据初步整理的情况来看，其中有不少材料是我国目前研究敦煌学的人所没有见到过的。
    这批卷子中佛经占的比重很大，其中除了些已失传的经典外，还有很多佛经的“变文”。“变文”是唐代佛教徒用通俗的文字编写成的一些有关佛教的故事。我国佛教文学中的通俗文字就是由那个时候开始的，它对唐以后的通俗文字影响很大。过去研究敦煌文献的人只知道有八十篇变文，现在从这批卷子里又发现了六篇，内容也偶有比较完整的。另外还发现了几篇新的押座文。押座文是那时佛教徒宣讲变文之前用的开场白，过去只知道有八篇。
    还有些记载唐代政治变动情况的史料，如唐僖宗时各方藩镇纷起称王，吐谷浑、吐蕃、回鹘等民族和唐争夺甘肃西部地区的情况；黄巢领导农民起义失败的经过；其中有不少材料，是以前我国历史资料中所没有见到的。
    另外还有些当时的社会资料，如从西凉到宋代（约自公元405年到987年）的户籍、授田籍，买卖人口、房屋、土地、牲畜和借贷布帛、谷物的契约。从这里面可以看出当时地主对劳动人民的剥削情况。
    这些卷子里还有一部完整的“西天路竟”，是记载那时佛教徒由洛阳经西安、新疆后翻过帕米尔高原到达印度中部全程所经过的国邑和里程。
    在这批卷子里的文学作品，除了有些比较完整的手抄本唐人诗集和小说外，还有主题非常独特、内容有风趣、文词又优美的“祭驴文”和“孔子项橐相问答”的长篇话本小说，以及“韩擒虎话本”。
    现在中国科学院图书馆已组织人力在整理这些材料，并编写目录，不久就可以出借供各方面研究使用。
