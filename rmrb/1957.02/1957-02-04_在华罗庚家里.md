    At Hua Luogeng's Home
      By our reporter Liu Shiping
      On the morning of January 31st, amid the sound of firecrackers, we arrived at the quiet Tsinghua Yuan (Tsinghua Garden). It was not yet ten o'clock when we approached Mr. Hua Luogeng's dormitory. The sunlight filled the windows, making it difficult to see the people inside. At this moment, a young man wearing glasses came out of the room. After asking about our purpose, he led us in with a smile. We then saw the whole family playing chess together. Hua Luogeng shook hands with us warmly, and immediately the conversation flowed.
    "She is the unsung hero," Hua Luogeng paced back and forth in the living room, introducing his wife to us in a very humorous way: "Her role is very important, and my entire work is inseparable from her."
    It turned out that his wife is a capable housewife. Although she is already the mother of six children, she still looks young and healthy. With her, Hua Luogeng can focus on his scientific research without being distracted by housework. He won the first science award from the Academy of Sciences this time and kept praising his wife's contribution.
    His words made everyone in the room laugh. At this moment, a little girl ran out of the inner room and into her mother's arms, clamoring to go to the movies. This is their youngest daughter, Hua Mi. After a while, her older sister, Hua Su, came out, took her little hand, and went to the Tsinghua University Auditorium with her second sister-in-law and Hua Luogeng's little granddaughter to see "Brother and Sister."
    Hua Su, already wearing a red scarf, is a "three-good student" at the Tsinghua University Affiliated Elementary School. Her second sister-in-law and second brother are in the same profession, both being internists. The little granddaughter is the daughter of her eldest sister, who came back to her grandmother's house for reunion during the Spring Festival.
    Mrs. Hua, seeing us inquiring about the children's relationships, pointed to the young man with glasses who had led us in and said repeatedly, "He is the third child, Hua Ling, and there is also a fourth, named Hua Guang."
    Hua Guang was born in the year of the victory against Japan. Hua Guang's name means that they lived a poor life of teaching during the war, having exhausted all their resources. In Hua Luogeng's own words, they had reached the point of "Qin Qiong selling his horse." With the victory of the war, they believed that there would be light and hope from then on, so he gave his fourth son this name with this double meaning.
    Before we finished talking, people came one after another to pay New Year's greetings and congratulate him on winning the award. There were so many people that his small living room was sometimes crowded.
    The first to arrive was one of his favorite students, Lu Qikeng, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Mathematics. He leaned on two crutches, like a wounded soldier just out of the hospital. Although his legs were diseased, he worked hard in mathematical research, just like his director, never slacking off.
    Last Spring Festival, when Yan Shijian, a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department of Beijing Normal University (also Hua Luogeng's student), came to his house, he gave Yan Shijian a sentence: "I hope that in the new year, he can have a qualitative change in his mathematical research work." Yan Shijian buried himself in hard work and participated in the postgraduate examination of the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences last year, and it is said that he has been admitted. This year, he passed this sentence on to Lu Qikeng. He explained that Lu Qikeng had already made some progress in mathematical research in terms of quantity, but he hoped that he would also strictly demand himself and improve in terms of quality. From their cordial conversation, everyone present felt that Hua Luogeng treated his students both warmly and strictly.
    Next came Cheng Minde, deputy director of the Mathematics Department of Peking University. They talked about the problems encountered in the Institute of Computing Technology that Hua Luogeng was preparing to establish. Then they talked about the lack of confidence among the students of the Mathematics Department of Peking University in the research of computing technology. They jointly believed that when mathematics is still a weak and blank area in our country, according to the most urgent needs of the country, the main problem at present is that people who study mathematics must more effectively link the achievements of theoretical science with specific practice. Therefore, the task before educators is to guide students to broaden their horizons, develop in an all-round way, and break through weak links. He gave an example: electronic computers are very useful in national defense and industrial construction. If machines can reduce physical labor, then electronic computers can reduce people's mental labor. Electronic computers are closely related to the research work of computing technology. However, our country's work in this area has just begun, and mathematical researchers and the younger generation need to make greater efforts.
    While everyone was listening quietly to their discussion, Wu Wenjun and a group of staff from the Institute of Mathematics arrived. Wu Wenjun is also a mathematician who won the first prize of the Science Award this time. Some people say that two of the three first prizes awarded by the Academy of Sciences this time were won by mathematicians, which shows that although mathematics in our country is still weak in theoretical science, from the creative achievements made by the two of them, it can be seen that our country's mathematical research work still has considerable achievements.
    Hua Luogeng's students came one after another. Some of them were already teachers, but to Hua Luogeng, they were still students. They were all proud of him for receiving the Science Award. After a few words of small talk, their topic turned back to mathematics. He encouraged them to dare to doubt boldly and think independently. They should dare to criticize errors in books and textbooks and not be afraid of disputes. He believed that true gold is not afraid of fire, and only through debate can right and wrong be distinguished.
    Speaking of the award, he happily took out a congratulatory telegram from Makushevich, the vice president of the Soviet Academy of Educational Sciences and an expert in the study of function theory. The telegram congratulated him on the glorious award he received in the study of function theory and hoped that he would have newer achievements in the future. As a person who loves mathematics all his life, the warm congratulations from Soviet friends are a great encouragement. His famous work "Additive Prime Number Theory" was first published in Russian in the Soviet Union. At that time, Academician Vignola Dov, director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, gave a high evaluation of this work, considering it to be a "most complete work."
    In recent years, he has had many social activities, but he has not relaxed his research and creation of mathematics at all. Not counting the papers scattered in newspapers and periodicals, just the books that have been published, in the six or seven years since he returned from the United States in 1950, he not only completed the recently awarded paper "Function Theory of Multiple Complex Variables on Typical Domains," but also revised "Additive Prime Number Theory" once, which will be reprinted soon. According to himself, the content of this revision has changed greatly, and several chapters have been rewritten. People all know that this book is his earliest successful work, published by the Institute of Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1946 when he visited the Soviet Union for the first time at the invitation of the Soviet Foreign Culture Association. It was not until after liberation that it was translated from Russian into Chinese and published in China. He couldn't help but sigh when he talked about this: "In the old society, the works of Chinese people could not get the opportunity to be published in China."
    Not only that, not long ago, he wrote a "Analytic Number Theory" for the Mathematics Encyclopedia of the Academy of Sciences of the Democratic Republic of Germany, and also completed a "Introduction to Number Theory" of 600,000 words, which will be published by the Science Press soon.
    He has not only made creative contributions to advanced mathematical theory, but also cares about the problem of middle school students learning mathematics. He has specially written a book about "Yang Hui's Triangle" for middle school students.
    Why is he able to achieve such great achievements? Some people think he is a genius. But Hua Luogeng is most opposed to this view. Everyone who knows him knows that he is only a junior high school graduate, and his achievements mainly rely on his own hard self-study. When I asked this question, everyone said that he has a greatest characteristic, which is concentration. Even in the busiest times, it never affects his research on mathematics. His eldest daughter, Hua Shun, told me: When she was a child, she fell and bled once, crying loudly, but did not disturb her father, who was concentrating on thinking about a math problem. To illustrate her father's concentration, Hua Shun gave another example: When their family is resting, they like to play chess and play cards together. You see him playing very enthusiastically, but his mind is still turning mathematical problems. Secondly, he will use all possible fragmented time, such as when he is going to and from work, sitting in the car, he will still draw and scratch, thinking about mathematical problems.
    Their introduction made me feel that his achievement is because he loves mathematics and loves his work.
    A day passed in joy, and when the sun set in the west, we said goodbye to Hua Luogeng's happy family with great interest.

    在华罗庚家里
      本报记者　刘时平
      1月31日早晨，我们在爆竹声中，到了幽静的清华园。当我们走近华罗庚先生的宿舍时，还不到十点。满窗阳光，使你看不清屋里的人。这时候，从室内走出来一位戴近视眼镜的年轻小伙子，他问明我们的来意后，笑盈盈地把我们引进去；这时才看到他们一家人正在一起下棋。华罗庚和我们亲切地握手，立时谈笑风生。
    “她是无名英雄”，华罗庚在客厅里转来转去，十分诙谐地向我们介绍了他的夫人：“她的作用很大，我的整个工作，是跟她分不开的。”
    原来他的爱人是一位善于持家的主妇。虽然她已是六个孩子的妈妈了，看上去还年轻健壮。有了她，使华罗庚在家务事上可以不再分心，专心致力于科学研究工作。他这次荣获了科学院首次评定的科学奖金，老是念念不忘地称道他夫人的功劳。
    他的话逗得满屋子的人都笑起来。这时候，里屋跑出来一个小姑娘，跑到她妈妈的怀里，嚷着要去看电影。这是他们最小的女儿华密。过一会儿，她的姐姐华苏出来，拉着她的小手，跟二嫂和华罗庚的小外孙女一块儿到清华大学的礼堂看“哥哥和妹妹”去了。
    华苏已经带上红领巾，是清华大学附小的三好学生。她的二嫂和二哥是同行，都是内科医生。小外孙女是她大姐的女儿，过春节时，才回到姥姥家里来团圆。
    华夫人看着我们在打听孩子们的关系，她指着刚才引我们进来的那位带近视眼镜的年轻人，连声说：“他是三儿华陵，还有一个老四，名叫华光。”
    华光是抗战胜利那年生的。华光的取名，是意味着他们在抗战期间过着教书的清苦生活，已经吃尽当光。用华罗庚自己的话来说，当时到了“秦琼卖马”的光景了。抗战胜利了，满以为从此有了光明和希望，就在这双关的意义上，给他的第四个儿子取了这个名字。
    我们的话还没谈完，拜年的，祝贺他得奖的人，一批接一批地来了。来的人真多，有时把他那间不宽敞的客厅挤得满满的。
    首先来的是他的一位得意门生，数学研究所的助理研究员陆启铿。他拄着两条拐杖，就像是刚出医院的荣誉军人。他的两条腿虽然有病，但在数学研究工作上，也和他们的所长一样，坚苦奋斗，从不稍怠。
    去年春节，北京师范大学数学系的助教严士健（也是华罗庚的学生），到他家来的时候，他曾赠给严士健一句话：“希望他在新的一年中，对数学研究工作能够有质的变化。”严士健埋头苦干，去年参加了科学院数学研究所研究生的考试，据说已经考取。今年他又把这句话转赠给陆启铿。他解释说，陆启铿在数学研究工作中，从量上说已经有了一定的进展，但是希望他还要严格要求自己，从质上能够有所提高。从他们亲切的谈话中，使我们在座的人感觉到：华罗庚对待他的学生，既热情又严格。
    跟着来到的是北京大学数学系副主任程民德。他们谈到华罗庚正在筹办的计算技术研究所碰到的问题。然后说到目前北京大学数学系的学生对计算技术的研究，信心还不足。他们共同认为数学这门科学在我国还是薄弱和空白的时候，根据国家最迫切的需要，当前的主要问题是学数学的人，一定要把理论科学的成果更有效地联系具体的实际。因此摆在教育工作者面前的，是要引导学生扩大眼界，向全面发展，攻破薄弱的环节。他举了一个例子：电子计算机，在国防和工业建设上的用处很大。如果说有了机器可以减轻体力劳动，那末有了电子计算机，就可以减轻人们的脑力劳动。电子计算机是和计算技术的研究工作有密切关系的。可是我国在这方面的工作还刚刚开始，需要数学研究工作者和青年一代付出更大的努力。
    大家正在静听他们谈论的时候，吴文俊和数学研究所的一批工作人员来了。吴文俊也是这次获得科学奖金一等奖的数学家。有人说这次科学院评定的三个一等奖中就有两个为数学家获得，说明我国的数学虽然在理论科学方面还是薄弱的，但从他们两位所取得的创造性成果来说，可以见到我国数学研究工作还是有相当成就的。
    华罗庚的学生接踵而来。他们中间有的早已经当老师了，不过，对华罗庚来说，还是学生。他们都为他得到科学奖金而感到光荣。谈不几句家常话，他们的话题就又转到数学方面去了。他鼓励他们要敢于大胆怀疑，独立思考。对于书本和教材中的错误，敢于提出批评，不要怕争论。他认为真金是不怕火炼的，只有经过争论，才能辨明是非。
    谈起得奖金的事，他高兴地拿出新近苏联教育科学院的副院长、研究函数论的专家马库希维奇拍来的贺电，这份电报大意是祝贺他在函数论的研究工作上得到了光荣的奖励，希望他今后有更新的成就。作为一位毕生热爱数学的人来说，苏联朋友们给他的亲切的祝贺，是一个很大的鼓舞。他的名著“堆垒素数论”，就是首先在苏联用俄文出版的，当时苏联科学院数学研究所所长、著名的数学家维格诺拉多夫院士曾经给过这部著作很高的评价，认为是一部“最完整的作品”。
    几年来他的社会活动很多，但他对数学的钻研和创作，还是丝毫没有放松过。不算散见在报刊的论文，光是成本的书，他从1950年由美国回来的六、七年里，不仅完成了最近得奖的论文“典型域上的多元复变数函数论”，同时还把“堆垒素数论”修改了一遍，即将重印。据他自己说：这次修正书中内容变动很大，有几章又重写了。人们都知道这本书是他最早的成功作品，是在1946年他应苏联对外文化协会的邀请，第一次访问苏联那一年，由苏联科学院数学研究所出版的。一直到解放后，才由俄文本翻译过来，在中国出版。他一谈起这件事来就不胜感慨地说：“在旧社会里，中国人的著作却得不到在中国出版的机会。”
    不仅如此，不久之前，他又为民主德国科学院数学百科全书写了一本“解析数论”，同时还完成了一本六十万字的“数论导引”，最近就要由科学出版社出版。
    他不只对高等数学理论作了创造性的贡献，还关心中学生学习数学问题。他已经专门为中学生写了一本关于“杨辉三角”的书。
    为什么他能有这样大的成就呢？有人认为他是天才。可是华罗庚最反对这种看法。凡是知道他的人，都知道他只是一个初中毕业生，他的成就主要是依靠自己的刻苦自修。在我问起这个问题的时候，大家都说他有一个最大的特点，就是专心。哪怕是在最忙乱的时候，也从来不会影响他钻研数学。他的大女儿华顺告诉我：她在小时候，有一次摔跤出血，嚎啕大哭，都没有惊动了她的正在聚精会神地想算题的父亲。华顺为了说明她爸爸的思想集中，又举了一个例：她们一家人在休息时，喜欢在一块儿下棋，玩扑克牌。你看他玩得很起劲，但是他的脑筋还在转数学题。其次，他会利用一切可能利用的零碎时间，比如他在上下班时，坐在汽车上还要划来划去，捉摸数学问题。
    她们的介绍，使我感觉到他的成就，就是因为他热爱数学，热爱他的工作。
    一天在欢乐中过去了，夕阳西斜时，我们兴致勃勃地告别了华罗庚欢乐的家庭。
