    Guangdong Returned Overseas Chinese Wu Shaoting
    Elected Vice County Head of Zhongshan County
    (From Our Newspaper) At the first meeting of the Second People's Congress of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, held on January 23rd, returned overseas Chinese Wu Shaoting was elected as the Vice County Head of Zhongshan County.
    Wu Shaoting only returned to China from Peru in 1954. He had been employed in restaurants and hotels overseas for a long time, suffering all kinds of bullying and oppression from imperialists and capitalists. Therefore, though he was abroad, his heart was with the motherland. After returning to China, he saw the rapid progress of the motherland's industrial construction and took the lead in investing 5,000 yuan. He also mobilized overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Zhongshan County to invest more than 30,000 yuan to support the motherland's industrial construction.
    Wu Shaoting is very concerned about the difficulties in the production and life of the farmers in his hometown, and he tries his best to help solve them. Last year, when Qinan Township started spring plowing, some farmers were affected by the spring famine, which affected spring plowing. He took the initiative to propose that the money he and other relatives of overseas Chinese had deposited in the credit cooperative be distributed to poor farmers first, so that the spring plowing production in the township could be carried out smoothly.
    Because he has won the trust of the people, he was elected as the Vice County Head.

    广东归侨伍少庭
    当选中山县副县长
    本报讯　在1月23日广东省中山县召开的第二届人民代表大会第一次会议上，归侨伍少庭被选为中山县的副县长。
    伍少庭在1954年才由秘鲁回国，在海外长期给餐馆、饭店当雇工，受尽帝国主义和资本家的欺凌和压迫，所以，身在国外，心在国内。回国以后，他看到祖国工业建设事业突飞猛进，就带头投资五千元，又动员海外华侨和中山县各地侨眷共投资三万多元支援祖国工业建设。
    伍少庭对家乡农民生产和生活上的困难非常关心，并竭力帮助加以解决，去年，旗南乡开始春耕生产时，有些农户因为春荒，影响春耕，他就主动提出将他自己和其他侨眷存在信用社的钱先发放给贫困的农户，因而使该乡的春耕生产顺利开展。
    因为他取得了人民的信任，就当选为副县长。
