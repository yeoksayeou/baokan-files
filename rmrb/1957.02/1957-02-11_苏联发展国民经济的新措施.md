    New Measures for the Development of the National Economy in the Soviet Union
    Zhang Ye
    Encouraged by the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet working people achieved new and great accomplishments in developing the national economy in 1956. The industrial sector as a whole overfulfilled the annual total output value plan. The total industrial output value increased by nearly 11% compared to 1955, and the output of industrial products greatly increased. Many crops achieved the highest yields in Soviet history. The total grain harvest increased by about 20% compared to 1955. The state purchased 3.304 billion poods of grain, which is more than one billion poods more than the best harvest years in the past. Based on the development of production and the increase in labor productivity, the material life of the Soviet working people has been greatly improved. The tremendous achievements of Soviet industrial and agricultural production in the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan marked a new step forward on the road to establishing the material and technical foundation of communism, and also undeniably demonstrated the great superiority of the Soviet socialist system.

    Implementing Lenin's Principles of Socialist Management
    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward a basic economic task, namely, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of industrial output per capita in the shortest historical period. In order to accomplish this historic task, the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union fully utilized the superiority of the socialist economic system and the rich resources of the Soviet Union in developing the national economy. In all activities of economic construction and cultural construction, they have unswervingly implemented Lenin's principles of socialist management based on democratic centralism. The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee plenary session in December 1956 "On Improving the Leadership of the Soviet National Economy" pointed out that democratic centralism in the leadership of the national economy arises from the essence of socialist large-scale production, from the nature of the socialist economy—a planned economy—and also from the essence of the Soviet system of mobilizing millions of working people to carry out conscious historical creation and participate in the management of national construction and economic construction. The CPSU Central Committee December plenary session also formulated many specific measures, such as raising the role of each union republic in economic leadership, greatly improving planning work, and raising the level of trade union work. In addition, the State Economic Commission was reorganized and strengthened. These measures fully conform to the socialist management principles based on democratic centralism and guarantee the further development of the Soviet national economy.

    Raising the Power of the Union Republics
    In recent years, the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union have taken many important measures to eliminate excessive centralization in economic management and to raise and expand the role of the union republics in economic leadership. The principle adopted is that, on the one hand, the economic needs of each union republic, the prospects for their economic and cultural development, and all the new things that arise in the life of each union republic should be carefully considered; on the other hand, a certain degree of centralization of the national economy should be maintained to ensure consistency in major, fundamental, and significant matters.

    On May 4, 1955, the Soviet Council of Ministers passed the "Resolution on Changing the National Planning and Economic Appropriation Methods of the Union Republics," which greatly expanded the power of the union republics in economic leadership, allowing the Councils of Ministers of the union republics to resolve issues related to the variety and production volume of industrial products of the republics' ministries, economic management agencies, and handicraft cooperatives, as well as the utilization of these products. In addition, the Councils of Ministers of the union republics were also allowed to approve the project schedules for various capital construction projects of the republics' ministries and economic management agencies (regardless of their budgetary value), to approve the project schedules for various construction projects of union-republic ministries with a budgetary value of up to 50 million rubles, and to approve public utilities, cultural, and health plans.

    Since 1954, many new union-republic and republic ministries have been established in the union republics to lead important economic sectors previously under the jurisdiction of the union. This is a major measure to expand the authority of the union republics in economic management. By the beginning of 1956, more than 11,000 industrial enterprises managed by the relevant ministries had been transferred from the jurisdiction of the entire union to the union republics. As a result of the implementation of these measures, the proportion of the union-republic and republic economies directly under the jurisdiction of the Councils of Ministers of the union republics in the Soviet national economic system has greatly increased. In 1953, the proportion of the total industrial output of the ministries and economic management agencies of the union republics in the total industrial production of the Soviet Union was 31%, while the plan for 1956 stipulated that this proportion should be increased to 50%. The output value of the republic ministries and union-republic ministries of individual union republics accounted for an even higher proportion of the total industrial output within their respective regions.

    In the resolution on the summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the task of further expanding the authority of the republic organs in economic construction and cultural construction was put forward. The resolution states: "In addition to the all-union ministries continuing to be responsible for general leadership, stipulating planning tasks, supervising the implementation of plans, supplying equipment, and allocating basic investments, it is also necessary to further expand the power of the republic ministries to carry out daily management of enterprises. This will help to further develop local creative initiative, further consolidate the union republics, and strengthen the friendship between the various nationalities of our country." Based on this resolution, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a new resolution on May 30, 1956, "On the Management of Enterprises in Many National Economic Sectors by the Union Republics and the Implementation of Relevant Organizational Measures," transferring enterprises and institutions previously directly under the jurisdiction of the union ministries, as well as retail commercial networks and public catering enterprises, to the management of the union republics.

    While expanding and raising the role of the union republics in economic leadership, it is also stipulated to expand the authority of the ministries, the general administrations of the ministries, the Soviets of Working People's Deputies, and economic enterprises, and to closely cooperate between the economic departments of the republics and the union-republic economic departments and the union departments. In this way, the leading organs of the union republics play a huge role in solving the problem of industrial layout, specialization and cooperation of enterprises, and eliminating the unreasonable and excessive transportation of industrial and agricultural products within the republics.

    Vigorously Improve Planning Work
    Democratic centralism, which is the basis of Lenin's socialist management principles, requires vigorously improving planning work in order to make it a powerful tool for organizing and guiding millions of working people to actively participate in economic management and economic construction.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union followed Lenin's instructions on attaching importance to planning work and continuously improved planning work. According to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on May 25, 1955, the original State Planning Committee was divided into the State Planning Committee for formulating long-term plans and the State Economic Committee for formulating annual plans. This decision brought the planning work of the Soviet national economy to a higher stage, making the long-term plans and annual plans more closely coordinated. The increase in the authority of the union republics in national economic management and the change in the economic planning and appropriation methods of the union republics require greatly improving the work of the planning organs of the union republics, states, border regions, and autonomous republics, and improving the deployment of all economic planning work of the union republics.

    The December Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union examined the existing shortcomings in the national economic plan and decided to take measures to fundamentally improve the annual planning work of the Soviet State Economic Committee, so that it has the right to flexibly solve problems that arise at any time in the completion of the state plan, and to ensure the supply of material resources necessary to complete the plan.

    In order to ensure the most rational and effective use of material and financial resources to develop the national economy, the resolution "On Completing the Work of Compiling the Sixth Five-Year Plan" passed by the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulated that the amount of investment should be reduced, the list of construction projects should be formulated more accurately, the number of construction projects should be reduced, especially the number of newly built construction projects, and material and financial resources should be concentrated on the most important construction projects and projects that have already started, in order to improve the material guarantee for them; to revise the planned tasks of certain industrial sectors that cannot be fully guaranteed by material resources; and to stipulate the establishment of necessary material reserves in industry in order to create normal conditions for the continuous and rhythmic work of enterprises.

    Raise the Level of Trade Union Work
    The Soviet trade unions have been faithful transmitters of the Party's policies at all stages of Soviet socialist and communist construction. Now, the Soviet trade unions have 46 million members, almost including all employees. It plays a very important role in improving the leadership of economic work and developing the national economy, in educating millions of employees and mobilizing them to improve production, participate in socialist competitions, increase labor productivity, and improve the material welfare of the working people.

    After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the activities of trade union organizations became more active. Trade union organizations at all levels began to pay more attention to solving problems related to production, labor organization and labor protection, meeting the ever-growing cultural and living requirements of employees, making wider use of employee congresses, production meetings, technical meetings of economic management activists, advanced producer rationalization proposers and inventors meetings, leading the signing of collective contracts, and widely developing the work of scientific and technological associations to mobilize the working people to participate in the management of production, carry out socialist competitions, and strive to complete and overfulfill economic plans and continuously develop the socialist economy. For example, regular production meetings are an effective form for all factory personnel to participate in production management and occupy an important position in trade union activities. The factory and workshop trade union committees carefully prepare for the convening of production meetings and consult with workers, foremen, and technicians on the most urgent issues in production. The factory manager, chief engineer, heads of various departments, and the chairman of the factory committee all participate in workshop production meetings, which makes it possible to solve many problems on the spot and practically affect the work process of the workshop and the entire enterprise. At production meetings, workers and staff put forward rationalization proposals on production issues. According to statistics for the first half of 1956, a total of 5 million suggestions were put forward at production meetings, of which 78.5% were adopted and implemented.

    Soviet trade union organizations also played a major role in mobilizing all employees to participate in socialist competitions, attracting the broad masses of working people to participate in socialist competitions, raising the creative enthusiasm of all employees, widely promoting advanced experiences and methods, increasing labor productivity, improving production working conditions, and striving to complete and overfulfill economic plans and continuously develop the socialist economy. In addition, Soviet trade union organizations also play a major role in improving the material welfare and cultural life conditions of workers and staff.

    The resolution "On Improving the Leadership of the Soviet National Economy" passed by the December Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union emphasized that trade union work should play an extremely important role in improving economic leadership, and that the activities of the Soviet trade unions should be raised to a considerable height so that the trade unions will fully live up to their mission. The resolution also emphasized the need to improve the role of trade unions in formulating and implementing enterprise production and financial plans, in solving issues related to labor quotas and organization, wages, and improving enterprise safety technology, and especially to improve the role of trade unions in solving issues related to housing construction and improving the material living conditions of workers and staff. It is necessary to improve the leadership of socialist competitions, eliminate formalism in leading this work, and regularly hold employee congresses, production meetings, technical meetings of economic management activists, advanced producer rationalization proposers and inventors meetings, etc., to mobilize employees to directly participate in production management.

    The Soviet people are advancing from victory to victory in the struggle to develop the national economy, build a strong and prosperous Soviet state, and strive to build a communist society. On the basis of the great development of various sectors of the national economy in 1956, there will be a new comprehensive upsurge in 1957. The Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, which began on February 5 this year, has adopted this year's national economic plan after discussion and review. According to the report of Comrade Belousov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the State Economic Committee, the main tasks of this year's plan are: to continue to give priority to the development of heavy industry, paying special attention to increasing the production of materials and raw materials necessary to complete the production and construction plan, such as coal, oil, gas, metals, electricity, building materials, etc.; to further develop the production of agriculture and daily necessities; and to strive to improve the material welfare and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of developing production. The plan stipulates that this year the Soviet industrial production volume will increase by 7.1% compared to last year, of which the production of means of production will increase by 7.8% and the production of consumer goods will increase by 5.9%; the annual growth rate of agricultural products and the amount of agricultural products purchased will also greatly increase; the total area of residential buildings completed and used will be 46 million square meters, an increase of 28% compared to last year. This marks the further development of the Soviet national economy and the greater strength of the Soviet state. The Soviet working people are vigorously carrying out socialist labor competitions and striving to complete and overfulfill the national economic plan.

    苏联发展国民经济的新措施
    章叶
    苏联劳动人民为苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议所鼓舞，1956年在发展国民经济方面获得了新的巨大成就。工业部门整个说来超额完成了年度总产值计划。工业总产值比1955年增加近11％，工业品的产量大大增加。许多农作物都获得了苏联历史上的最高产量，谷物总收获量比1955年约增加20％，国家征购了三十三亿零四百万普特的粮食，这比过去历史上年成最好的时候还要多十亿多普特。在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，苏联劳动人民的物质生活有了很大的改善。苏联工农业生产在第六个五年计划第一年所获得的巨大成就，表明了在建立共产主义物质技术基础的道路上向前跨了新的一步，同时也无可争辩地表明了苏维埃社会主义制度的巨大优越性。
    实行列宁的社会主义经营原则
    苏共第二十次代表大会提出一项基本经济任务，即要在最短的历史时期内在按人口计算的工业产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。为了完成这一历史性的任务，苏联共产党和政府在发展国民经济方面充分运用社会主义经济制度的优越性和苏联的丰富资源，在自己的经济建设和文化建设的各项活动中，首先坚持不懈地实行以民主集中制为基础的列宁的社会主义经营原则。苏共中央1956年12月全会通过的“关于改进苏联国民经济领导问题”的决议指出，国民经济领导工作中的民主集中制是从社会主义大生产的本质产生的，是从社会主义经济——有计划的经济——的性质产生的，也是从发动千百万劳动人民进行自觉的历史性创造以及参加管理国家建设和经济建设的苏维埃制度的实质产生的。苏共中央12月全会并拟定许多具体措施，如提高各加盟共和国在经济领导中的作用，大大改进计划工作，提高工会工作的水平。另外还改组和加强了国家经济委员会。这些措施都充分符合以民主集中制为基础的社会主义经营原则，并保证苏联国民经济的进一步发展。
    提高加盟共和国的权力
    最近几年来，苏联共产党和政府采取了许多重要措施以消除经济管理上的过分集中现象，提高和扩大加盟共和国在经济领导方面的作用。采取的原则是，一方面仔细考虑各加盟共和国的经济需要，它们的经济和文化发展的前景，以及各加盟共和国生活中产生的一切新事物；另一方面还要保持国民经济的一定程度的集中，以求在主要的、根本性的和重大事情上步调一致。
    1955年5月4日苏联部长会议通过了“关于改变国家计划和各加盟共和国经济拨款办法”的决议，大大扩大了各加盟共和国在经济领导方面的权力，让各加盟共和国部长会议解决共和国各部、经济主管机关、工艺合作社的工业产品生产品种和生产量的问题，以及这些产品的利用问题。此外，也让各加盟共和国部长会议批准共和国各部和经济主管机关的各项基本建设工程的工程项目表（不论其预算价值多大），批准联盟兼共和国各部预算价值在五千万卢布以内的各项建筑工程的工程项目表，以及批准公用事业、文化和保健计划。
    从1954年起，各加盟共和国先后成立了许多新的联盟兼共和国的部和共和国的部，对以前归联盟管辖的重要经济部门进行领导，这是扩大各加盟共和国在经济管理的权限的重大措施。到1956年初，由全联盟管辖移交给各加盟共和国有关的部管理的各种工业企业有一万一千多个。由于实施这些措施，直接归加盟共和国部长会议管辖的联盟兼共和国的经济和共和国的经济，在苏联国民经济体系中所占的比重大大地提高了。1953年各加盟共和国的部和经济主管机关的全部工业在苏联工业生产总额中占的比重为31％，而1956年的计划则规定把这个比重提高到50％，个别加盟共和国的共和国部和联盟兼共和国部的产值在本共和国区域内的工业总产值中占的比重更高。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会通过的关于苏联共产党中央委员会总结报告的决议中，提出了进一步扩大共和国机关在经济建设和文化建设方面的权力的任务。决议中写道：“除了全联盟各部仍旧负责进行总的领导、规定计划的任务、监督计划的执行、供应设备、拨付基本投资以外，同时必须进一步扩大共和国各部对企业进行日常管理的权力。这将有助于更大地发挥地方的创造主动性，进一步巩固各加盟共和国以及加强我国各族人民之间的友谊。”苏共中央和苏联部长会议根据这个决议于1956年5月30日通过了一项“关于许多国民经济部门的企业交由各加盟共和国管理和实施有关的组织措施”的新的决议，把以前直接归联盟各部管辖的企业和机构，以及零售商业网和公共饮食企业，都移交给加盟共和国管理。
    在扩大和提高加盟共和国在经济领导方面的作用的同时，还规定扩大各部、各部的总管理局、劳动人民代表苏维埃、经济企业的权限，并且使共和国经济部门和联盟兼共和国经济部门同联盟部门密切协作。这样，加盟共和国的领导机关在解决共和国范围内的工业配置问题、企业的专业化和协作问题、以及消灭工业品和农产品的不合理运输和过远运输问题等方面起着巨大的作用。
        大力改进计划工作
    作为列宁的社会主义经营原则基础的民主集中制要求大力改进计划工作，以便把它作为组织和指导千百万劳动人民积极参加经济管理和经济建设工作的有力工具。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议遵循列宁关于重视计划工作的指示，不断地改进计划工作。根据1955年5月25日苏共中央和苏联部长会议的决定，原来的国家计划委员会被分为编制远景计划的国家计划委员会和编制年度计划的国家经济委员会。这个决定使苏联国民经济计划工作进入了更高的阶段，使远景计划和年度计划更加密切地配合起来。各加盟共和国在国民经济管理中权限的提高和各加盟共和国经济计划和拨款办法改变，要求大大改进各加盟共和国、州、边疆区和自治共和国计划机关的工作，改进各加盟共和国所有经济计划工作的部署。
    苏共中央12月全会检查了目前存在的国民经济计划中的缺点，决定采取措施以根本改善苏联国家经济委员会的年度计划工作，使它有权灵活地解决在完成国家计划中随时发生的问题，并且保证供给完成计划所必需的物质资料。
    为了保证最合理和最有效地使用物力和财力来发展国民经济，苏共中央12月全会通过的“关于完成编制第六个五年计划的工作”的决议规定：要减少投资额，更加精确地制定建设项目清单，减少建设项目，首先是减少新兴建的建设工程，要把物力财力集中用于最重要的建设工程和已经开工的项目上去，以便改进对它们的物资保证；修改某些不能得到充分物质资源保证的工业部门的计划任务；规定在工业中建立必需的物资储备，以便为企业不停顿的、有节奏的工作创造正常的条件。
      提高工会工作的水平
    苏联工会在苏联社会主义和共产主义建设的各个阶段都是党的政策的忠实传导者。现在，苏联工会拥有四千六百万会员，差不多包括所有的职工，它在改善领导经济工作和发展国民经济的事业中，在教育千百万职工群众和动员他们去改进生产，参加社会主义竞赛，提高劳动生产率和改善劳动人民物质福利方面起着极其重大的作用。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，工会组织的活动更加活跃起来了。各级工会组织开始更多地注意解决生产、劳动组织与劳动保护、满足职工不断增长的文化和生活方面的要求问题，更广泛地利用职工大会，生产会议，善于管理经济的积极分子的技术会议，先进生产者合理化建议者和发明者会议，领导签订集体合同，广泛展开科学技术协会的工作，以动员劳动人民参加管理生产，开展社会主义竞赛，为完成和超额完成经济计划、不断发展社会主义经济而斗争。例如，定期举行的生产会议是工厂全体人员参加生产管理的一种有效形式，在工会活动中占重要地位。工厂和车间的工会委员会仔细地准备生产会议的召开，同工人、工长、技师商量有关生产中的最迫切问题。工厂经理、总工程师、各科科长和工厂委员会主席都参加车间生产会议，这就有可能使许多问题就地解决，并实际影响车间和整个企业的工作进程。在生产会议上，工人和职员就生产问题提出合理化建议。据1956年上半年统计，在生产会议上提出的建议总共有五百万件，其中有78.5％的建议被采纳实行。
    苏联工会组织在动员全体职工参加社会主义竞赛方面也发挥很大作用，它吸引广大劳动群众参加社会主义竞赛，提高全体职工的创造积极性，广泛推广先进经验和方法，提高劳动生产率，改进生产工作条件，争取完成和超额完成经济计划和不断发展社会主义经济。此外，苏联工会组织在改善工人和职员的物质福利和文化生活条件方面也起着很大的作用。
    苏共中央12月全会通过的“关于改进苏联国民经济领导问题”的决议着重指出，工会工作在改善经济领导方面应当起极其重大的作用，应当把苏联工会的活动提高到相当的高度，使工会完全不辜负自己的使命。决议还强调必须提高工会在制定和执行企业生产财政计划，在解决有关劳动定额和组织、工资、改进企业安全技术等问题方面的作用，特别要提高工会在解决有关住宅建筑和改善工人和职员的物质生活条件方面的作用。要改进对社会主义竞赛的领导，消除领导这个工作中的形式主义，定期举行动员职工直接参加管理生产的职工大会、生产会议、善于管理经济的积极分子的技术会议、先进生产者合理化建议者和发明者会议等。
    苏联人民在发展国民经济、建设强大繁荣的苏维埃国家和争取建成共产主义社会的斗争中，正在从胜利走向胜利。在1956年国民经济各部门获得巨大发展的基础上，1957年将有新的全面高涨。今年2月5日起举行的苏联最高苏维埃第六次会议经过讨论和审查，已经通过今年的国民经济计划。根据苏联部长会议第一副主席、国家经济委员会主席别尔乌辛同志的报告，今年计划的主要任务是：继续优先发展重工业，特别注意增加为完成生产建设计划所必需的材料和原料的生产，如煤炭、石油、煤气、金属、电力、建筑材料等等；进一步发展农业和日用品工业的生产；在发展生产的基础上努力提高人民的物质福利和文化生活水平。计划规定今年苏联工业生产量要比去年增加7.1％，其中生产资料的生产增加7.8％，消费资料的生产增加5.9％；农业产品每年增长的速度和农产品的收购量也要大大增加；建成使用的住宅面积总额为四千六百万平方公尺，比去年增加28％。这标志着苏联国民经济的更加发展和苏联国家威力的更加强大。苏联劳动人民正在大力开展社会主义劳动竞赛，为完成和超额完成国家经济计划而努力。
