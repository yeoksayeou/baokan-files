Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 24th. In order to ensure that there are sufficient quantities of high-quality seeds for sowing this year in Heilongjiang Province, and to strive for a bumper harvest, the province is now conducting organized seed inspections.

Last autumn in Heilongjiang Province, there was heavy rainfall and early snowfall, resulting in high moisture content in the retained seeds. The phenomenon of agricultural cooperative seeds being damaged by frost and having low germination rates is very serious. Drawing lessons from the reduced grain production caused by poor seed quality in some agricultural cooperatives last year, various localities have started seed inspections earlier this year. Agricultural cooperatives in various localities have generally inspected seed storage conditions and conducted seed germination tests. Moreover, by adopting the method of inspecting and resolving problems simultaneously, they are actively expanding seed sources and improving seed quality.

While solving seed problems, various localities have also strengthened the promotion of improved varieties of various crops. The province's planting area for improved varieties will increase from 1.6 million hectares last year to 2.2 million hectares.

    黑龙江进行春播种籽大检查
    据新华社哈尔滨24日电　黑龙江省为保证今年有数量充足、质量较好的种籽用来播种，以争取大丰收，现在全省有组织的展开了种籽大检查工作。
    黑龙江省去年秋天雨水大、下雪早，所留种籽含水分较多，农业社种籽被冻坏，发芽率低的现象很严重。各地吸取了去年某些农业社因为种籽质量不好而造成粮食减产的教训，今年提早进行了种籽大检查。各地农业社普遍检查了种籽保管情况，进行了种籽发芽试验。并且采取边检查、边解决的办法，积极扩大种籽来源，提高种籽质量。
    在解决种籽问题的同时，各地还加强了各种农作物的良种推广工作。全省良种种植面积将由去年的一百六十万公顷增加到二百二十万公顷。
