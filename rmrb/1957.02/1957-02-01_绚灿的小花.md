    Dazzling Little Flowers Han Shangyi
    Not long ago, at the Beijing Railway Station, I met the animation film location team from the Shanghai Film Studio returning from the Keerqin Grassland. They had gone to Inner Mongolia to experience life in preparation for the production of the animated film "Wooden Girl." After a month of northern wind and sand, the faces of these dozen or so young southerners had become dark and shiny. From their joyful smiles, I knew that the trip had been fruitful, and they were now confidently preparing to return to the studio to begin creating. Watching their sturdy figures as they walked away, my mind also, like a film's "fade out" and "fade in," projected several beautiful domestic color animation films that I had recently seen.
    "The Magic Brush," which has won international acclaim, is adapted from the familiar story of "Ma Liang and the Magic Brush." The film uses a lively and vivid fairy tale form, exaggerated and prominent puppet shapes, and imaginative depictions to satirize the vile and shameless bureaucrats and praise the diligent practice of Ma Liang. In the face of this clever child, the greedy bureaucrat made a complete fool of himself.
    "Why Are Crows Black?" depicts a clever and beautiful bird that, due to pride, complacency, and a dislike of labor, eventually becomes a hated black crow. Although the film is short, it has a profound meaning, and it is not only suitable for children to appreciate, but also has educational significance for adults. At the same time, the film's artistic techniques are also unique. The beautiful bird's journey from triumph to disappointment, from singing and dancing to anger and shame, and finally being burned into an ugly crow, is portrayed through clear layers of image, action, and sound. It can be said to be a wonderful anthropomorphic animated fable.
    Other examples include "Careless Little Fatty," which criticizes sloppy work styles, "Little Bear's Trip," which teaches children to cherish time, "Mr. Dong Guo," which promotes vigilance, and "I Know," which satirizes those who pretend to know what they don't. All of these are very vivid and interesting. What is even more gratifying is that the modeling and background processing of most of the works consciously pursue national forms and have achieved certain results.
    If we look back at works such as "Little Cat Fishing" and "Little Tie Zhu" from two or three years ago, we can see that the animation filmmakers have made significant progress.
    When the comrades of the "Wooden Girl" production team told me that a new animation film studio was about to be established and that the new animated film "Proud General" (written by Hua Junwu, directed by Te Wei) was also about to be completed, I was happy for the cause of Chinese animation and even happier for the children! At the same time, I also hope that on the basis of the current gradual improvement of art and technology, we can increase the production of animation films, because the children's current opinion is: "There are too few animation films!"
    Increasing production requires expanding creative themes. We must vigorously develop folk children's stories, ethnic children's stories, and themes that reflect real life. It is also possible and necessary to adapt Chinese classical poetry, novels, legends, etc., into animation. The scope of animation themes is infinitely broad, and I hope that more artists, writers, and musicians will participate in this field, so that animation films, these dazzling little flowers, can bloom more luxuriantly in the garden of art.

    绚灿的小花	韩尚义
    不久前，在北京车站会见从科尔沁草原回来的上海电影制片厂的美术片外景队，他们是因筹备摄制动画“木头姑娘”而到内蒙古去体验生活的。十几个南方青年经过一个月的北国风沙，脸变得又黑又亮。从他们喜悦的笑容上知道此行丰收，现在又满怀信心地准备回厂进行创作了。看着他们结实的远去的背影，我脑子里也像一幕影片的“淡出”“淡入”一样，映现出最近看到的几部优美的国产彩色美术片来。
    在国际上获得好评的“神笔”，是大家熟悉的故事“神笔马良”改编的。影片用生动活泼的童话形式，夸张突出的木偶造型，和富有幻想的刻划，来讽刺卑劣无耻的官僚，歌颂勤修苦练的马良。在这个智慧的孩子面前，那个贪财的官僚出足了洋相。
    “乌鸦为什么是黑的”描写一只聪明美丽的鸟，因为骄傲自满，不爱劳动而终于成了为人所厌恶的黑乌鸦。影片的篇幅虽然很短，但寓意深长，它不仅适合孩子们欣赏，对大人也何尝没有教育意义。同时这影片的艺术技巧也有独到之处，像这只美丽的鸟从得意到失意，从歌舞欢乐到恼羞成怒，直至被火烧成一只难看的乌鸦，其形象、动作和声音都是层次分明的，可以说是一部美妙的拟人化的美术寓言。
    又如批评粗枝大叶作风的“粗心的小胖”，教育孩子珍惜时间的“小熊旅行记”，提倡加强警惕性的“东郭先生”和讽刺不懂装懂的“我知道”等，也都很生动有趣、更可喜的是大部分作品的造型和背景处理都意识地追求民族形式，而且得到一定的成绩。
    如果我们回头看一看二三年前的“小猫钓鱼”、“小铁柱”等作品，我们能体会到美术片工作者们有了显著的进步。
    当“木头姑娘”摄制小组的同志告诉我说新的美术片制片厂将要建立，新的动画片“骄傲的将军”
  （华君武编剧，特伟导演）也即将完成了的时候，我为中国的美术片事业高兴，更为孩子们高兴！同时我也希望在目前艺术和技术逐步提高的基础上，增加美术片的产量，因为现在孩子们的意见是：“美术片太少太少了！”
    增加产量必须扩大创作题材，像民间儿童故事，民族儿童故事，和反映现实生活的题材都要大力开拓。又如把中国古典诗词小说传奇等改编成动画，也很有可能和必要。美术片的题材范围是无限广阔的，希望有更多的美术家、文学家、音乐家们来参与这个行列，使美术片这种绚灿的小花，在艺术园地里开得更茂盛。（附图片）
