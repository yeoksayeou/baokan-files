Cherishing the Eucommia Tree
    Lin Ding

    Eucommia is a unique product of China. It is both a medicinal plant and a rubber plant.

    Eucommia trees are widely distributed, mainly growing in Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, and other provinces. Recently, artificially cultivated eucommia trees have also been found in the Western Hills of Beijing, located at approximately 40 degrees north latitude, and they are growing well.

    Eucommia is a deciduous tree that grows rapidly. Three-year-old eucommia saplings can reach a height of one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters). The state-owned eucommia tree farms newly established after Liberation in Zunyi, Liangping, Cili, and other places have, over the years, created eucommia forests that are now beginning to flourish.

    Eucommia has high economic value. The commonly used and valuable traditional Chinese medicines "Hou Zhong" and "Shen Zhong" are derived from the dried bark of the eucommia tree. According to traditional Chinese medicine, this medicine has the effect of tonifying the liver, benefiting the kidneys, and calming the mind. The annual sales volume of this medicine is quite large. Incomplete statistics from the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou alone show a need for more than 200,000 jin (approximately 100,000 kilograms) of raw eucommia in 1953.

    In recent years, the application of "Eucommia" in medicine has seen new developments. Clinical trials conducted by Soviet and Chinese physicians in recent years have shown that "Eucommia" and "Eucommia tincture" are more effective than the chemical drugs "Luminal" and "Aminophylline" in treating hypertension, especially early-stage hypertension, and have no side effects.

    Rubber raw materials can also be collected from eucommia trees. Various tissues and organs of the entire eucommia tree (except for the xylem) contain different amounts of silver-colored rubber filaments. The seeds contain the most rubber, accounting for 15%-27.5%; the root bark contains 10%-12%; the tree bark contains 5%-10%; and the leaves contain 3%. This rubber is a type of hard rubber with extremely strong insulation and acid resistance. In particular, it is resistant to seawater corrosion, making it an ideal insulation material for packaging submarine cables and aerial cables. It can also be used as a raw material for containers for strong medicines and other rubber daily necessities.

    Eucommia trees produce rubber early. Brazilian rubber trees generally start producing rubber five to ten years after planting, while eucommia trees can have their leaves collected from the seedbed for rubber refining in the early winter of the same year they are sown. Its rubber production exceeds that of evergreen hard rubber trees of the same age in Malaysia. In terms of value, it is far higher than ordinary rubber.

    Although eucommia has high economic value, China has not yet been able to fully utilize it. Pure eucommia forests are rare, and most trees are scattered in front of and behind villages. In the past, the masses only knew to cut down trees to extract bark and did not pay attention to planting. Now, fifty-year-old trees are almost extinct, and thirty-year-old trees are also rare. The source of medicinal eucommia bark is gradually decreasing, and it is already showing signs of supply not meeting demand. Therefore, educating farmers to cherish eucommia trees, not to arbitrarily fell them or strip their bark, to facilitate the growth of eucommia trees, is a problem worth noting. (Attached picture)

    爱护杜仲树
    林丁
    杜仲是中国的特产。它是一种药用植物；也是一种橡胶植物。
    杜仲的分布地区很广，主要生长在贵州、四川、云南、湖北、湖南、陕西等省。最近在地处北纬四十度左右的北京西山，也发现有人工栽培的杜仲，生长良好。
    杜仲是落叶乔木，生长很快。三年生的杜仲幼林，高度可达一丈。解放后新建的遵义、梁平、慈利等国营杜仲专业林场，几年来所造的杜仲林，现在都开始蔚然成林。
    杜仲的经济价值很高。常用的贵重的中药“厚仲”“神仲”，就是杜仲树的干皮。据中医说这种药有补肝、益肾、清神之效。这种药每年销售的数量相当大。仅北京、上海、广州三大城市1953年全年的不完全统计，就需用生杜仲二十多万斤。
    近年“杜仲”在医疗上的应用有了新的发展。苏联和我国医师年来临床试用结果，证明“杜仲”和“杜仲酊”对于治疗高血压尤其是早期高血压的功能超过化学药品“鲁米那”和“氨基茶咸”，而且没有任何副作用。
    从杜仲树上还可以采集橡胶原料。杜仲全株的各种组织和器官（除木质部外），都含有不同分量的银色胶丝。其中以种子的含胶量最多，占15％—27.5％；根皮含10％—12％；树皮含5％—10％；叶片含3％。这种胶质属硬橡胶，绝缘力和抗酸性都极强，尤其是它具有不易受海水腐蚀的特点，因此是包装海底电线和空中电线最理想的绝缘材料，也可用以作为强烈药剂的容器及其他橡胶日用品的原料。
    杜仲产胶期早。巴西橡胶树一般要五年到十年后才开始割胶，而杜仲在播种当年的初冬，便可从苗床上收集叶片，进行炼胶。它的产胶量也超过马来亚同龄级的常绿硬胶树的产胶量。以价值论，它又远比普通橡胶为高。
    杜仲的经济价值虽高，但我国目前还未能加以充分利用。杜仲纯林较少，大都散生于村前庄后。过去群众只知砍树取皮，不重视种植。现在五十年生的大树几乎绝迹，三十年生的也不多见了。目前药用杜仲皮的来源渐少，并且已经呈现供不应求的迹象。因此，教育农民爱护杜仲树，不随便滥伐和剥树皮，以利于杜仲树的生长，是一个值得注意的问题。（附图片）
