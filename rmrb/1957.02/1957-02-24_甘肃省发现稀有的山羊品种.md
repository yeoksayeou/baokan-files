Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, February 23rd. A rare goat breed, the Zhongwei Lambskin Goat, has been discovered in Gansu Province and is comparable to the world-renowned Angora goat. This was confirmed by three joint investigations and studies conducted by the Northwest Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, the Lanzhou Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science, and the Zhongwei County Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station.

The Zhongwei Lambskin Goat's lambskin has many curls (generally four or five), is long and white, and is similar to the famous Tan sheepskin in China. Its advantage over Tan sheepskin is that it does not easily stick together, making it suitable for leather clothing. The lambskin has fine and soft down, suitable for making various high-grade wool fabrics. The adult goat's down is more than ten centimeters long, has a sheen, and can be used to weave thick blankets. The meat of the Zhongwei Lambskin Goat is fragrant, tender, and without any muttony odor, similar to that of ordinary sheep.

The Zhongwei Lambskin Goat is mainly distributed in the adjacent areas of Zhongwei, Jingyuan, Haiyuan, Tongxin, and Jingtai counties in northwestern Gansu Province. According to preliminary estimates, there are about 200,000 heads, of which about 50,000 are of excellent quality. Although they grow in arid areas with extremely extensive grazing conditions, they still maintain their original excellent breed characteristics. Soviet experts believe that if breeding stations are established in the lambskin goat producing areas in the future to carry out breeding work to improve the original breed, its body weight, wool yield, and wool quality will be greatly improved.

    甘肃省发现稀有的山羊品种
    新华社兰州23日电　甘肃省发现了一种稀有的山羊品种——中卫羔皮山羊，可与世界驰名的安哥拉山羊相媲美。这是经西北畜牧兽医学院、兰州畜牧兽医科学研究所和中卫县畜牧兽医工作站的三次联合调查研究确定的。
    中卫羔皮山羊的羔皮毛弯曲多（一般有四、五个弯），长而洁白，和我国著名的滩羊皮相似，胜于滩羊皮的优点是不容易粘在一块，适于做皮衣。这种羔皮绒毛纤细柔软，适于作各种高级呢子；成羊的绒毛长十余厘米，有闪光，可以织厚毛毯。中卫羔皮山羊肉质香嫩而无膻气，和一般绵羊相似。
    中卫羔皮山羊主要分布在甘肃省西北部的中卫、靖远、海原、同心及景泰县的毗连地区，据初步估计约有二十万头左右，其中品质优良者有五万头左右。它们虽生长在干旱的地区，放牧条件极端粗放，但还保持着原始的优良品种。苏联专家认为：如果今后在羔皮山羊产区设立优良品种选育站，进行选种培育工作，改良原始品种，它的体重、毛量、毛质等将得到很好的提高和改进。
