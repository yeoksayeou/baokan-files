    Adjusting Labor Organization Should Be Adapted to Local Conditions
    (Our dispatch) Nanning – The Pingfu Agricultural Cooperative in Wuming County, Guangxi, originally had twenty-one production teams. Among them, nine teams cultivated entirely dry land crops, while the remaining twelve teams cultivated rice paddies. This division of cultivated areas was disadvantageous for production and management in many ways: Production teams cultivating dry land crops had to rush to plant corn, peanuts, tobacco, cassava, taro, pumpkins, and other dry land crops between the Beginning of Spring and Rain Water solar terms, making them too busy and requiring a large number of laborers from rice-growing production teams to provide support. During the busy season of rice transplanting, the rice-growing production teams also became too busy, requiring support from the dry land crop-growing production teams. This created a phenomenon of large-scale labor transfer and made it impossible to fully implement the systems of contracted output and contracted resources. The allocation of draught cattle was also unreasonable.
    The cooperative's management committee recently made adjustments so that each team had both paddy fields and dry land. Appropriate adjustments were also made to draught cattle and labor.
    The labor enthusiasm of each production team has greatly increased, and they are stepping up preparations for spring plowing.

    调整劳动组织应该因时制宜
    本报讯　广西武鸣县平福农业社原有二十一个生产队，其中有九个队的耕作区完全是种植旱地作物，其余十二个队却是种水稻。这样划分耕作区对生产和经营管理有很多不利：种植旱地作物的生产队，要在立春到雨水期间抢种玉米、花生、烤烟、木薯、芋头、南瓜等旱地作物，忙不过来，需要种水稻的生产队派大量劳动力支援；而在插秧大忙时，种水稻的生产队又忙不过来，需要种旱地作物的生产队支援。这样就形成了大拨工的现象，而且使包产、包资财不能贯彻实现。在耕牛的分配上也不合理。
    社的管理委员会最近作了调整：各个队既有水田，也有旱地。耕牛和劳动力也作了适当调整。
    各个生产队劳动积极性大为提高，正在加紧备耕工作。
