    Efforts to Promote Solidarity and Cooperation Among Asian and African Countries
    Premier Zhou Enlai visited Ceylon from January 31 to February 5 at the invitation of the Ceylonese government and was given a grand welcome by the government and people of Ceylon. During the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Bandaranaike of Ceylon held sincere and friendly talks on the international situation and issues related to the interests of both countries, and issued a joint statement on February 5. This is an exciting new development in the friendly relations between China and Ceylon, and a beneficial contribution to promoting the solidarity and cooperation of the Asian and African peoples and safeguarding world peace.
    The people of China and Ceylon have had traditional friendship since ancient times. As early as the beginning of the first century AD, China and Ceylon had close ties in culture, trade, and other fields. After shaking off the shackles of colonialism, the friendly relations between our two countries have been further developed on a new basis. Ceylon was one of the first countries to recognize our country after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In 1951, China and Ceylon established trade relations. In October 1952, the Ceylonese government, disregarding the embargo policy of Western countries, officially signed a long-term trade contract with our country. Last September, representatives of China and Ceylon held talks in Beijing and decided to recommend that their respective governments send diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level to each other once the necessary arrangements were made. At the same time, the two countries reached broad agreements on developing economic cooperation, trade relations, and strengthening cultural exchanges. Based on this agreement, trade delegations from the two countries held useful discussions in Colombo at the end of last year on increasing trade between the two countries and developing technical assistance. Facts show that the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Ceylon has brought great benefits to the economic development of both countries. We are pleased to see that the Prime Ministers of the two countries expressed their common determination in the joint statement to further strengthen the unity between our two countries and develop economic cooperation and cultural exchanges.
    The continuous development of friendly relations between China and Ceylon is not accidental. In the past, both of our countries suffered from the scourge of colonialism, and today we both face the tasks of safeguarding our respective independence, building our own countries, and promoting world peace and international cooperation. As one of the initiators of the Asian-African Conference, Ceylon, together with China and other Asian and African countries, insisted on the principles of safeguarding national independence, striving for world peace, promoting international friendship and cooperation, and opposing colonialism at this conference. These principles have become a solid foundation for developing friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. Now, the joint statement of the two Prime Ministers not only reaffirms the principles of the Bandung Conference, but also regards the famous "Panchsheel" - the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence - as our common ideal. This provides a more reliable guarantee for further strengthening friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.
    The first Asian-African Conference held in April 1955 provided a good example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and political systems and among nations of different colors, languages, and beliefs, thereby strengthening the friendship and cooperation among the 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa and strengthening peace in Asia and Africa and the world. We believe that the convening of another Asian-African conference will be very beneficial for concretely realizing the principles of the Bandung spirit, for further promoting the unity and cooperation of the Asian and African peoples, and for easing the international situation. Therefore, the people of our country express their heartfelt support and endorsement for the suggestion in the joint statement of the two countries to convene another Asian-African conference at the appropriate earliest time.
    As everyone knows, due to the evil consequences of long-term colonial rule, some unresolved issues have been left over in the mutual relations between Asian and African countries. Colonialists are attempting to use these issues to undermine the unity of Asian and African countries, create discord among these countries, and provoke conflicts in order to achieve their goal of restoring colonial rule. For this reason, it is in the common interest of the peoples of the countries concerned and in the interests of peace in the region for Asian and African countries to strive for peaceful resolution of these issues through friendly consultation in the spirit of mutual trust and understanding. It is precisely from this common desire of goodwill and sincerity that the Prime Ministers of China and Ceylon expressed their views on resolving the Kashmir issue in the joint statement.
    The situation in Egypt and the entire Middle East is a matter of great concern to the people of all countries in the world. Colonialists are carrying out new acts of aggression in the Middle East under the pretext of so-called "filling the vacuum," attempting to replace one strong country with another. The joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and Ceylon points out that this practice of the colonialists cannot solve the problems in this region, and that only by allowing the people of the Middle East to decide their own destiny according to their own will can peace in this region be guaranteed. The position of the Prime Ministers of China and Ceylon is a strong support for the national independence movements of the countries in the Middle East.
    This visit to Ceylon by the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou has achieved satisfactory results in promoting the friendship between China and Ceylon. We believe that in the future, in the course of increasingly frequent contacts and exchanges, we will definitely be able to better promote the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. The people of China and Ceylon will work together with the people of Asian and African countries to safeguard world peace and promote international cooperation.

### 促进亚非国家团结合作的努力

    促进亚非国家团结合作的努力
    周恩来总理从1月31日到2月5日应邀访问了锡兰，受到了锡兰政府和人民的盛大欢迎。在访问期间，周恩来总理和锡兰班达拉奈克总理就国际局势和两国利益有关的问题进行了诚挚和友好的会谈，并于2月5日发表了联合声明。这是中锡两国友好关系中令人兴奋的新发展，也是对于促进亚非人民团结合作和维护世界和平事业的有益贡献。
    我国和锡兰人民自古以来就有着传统的友谊。早在公元一世纪初，中锡两国在文化、贸易等方面就已有过密切的联系。在摆脱了殖民主义的束缚以后，我们两国之间的友好关系在新的基础上得到了更大的发展。中华人民共和国宣布成立以后，锡兰是最先承认我国的国家之一。1951年我国同锡兰建立了贸易关系。1952年10月间，锡兰政府不顾西方国家的禁运政策，同我国正式签订了长期贸易合同。去年9月，中锡两国代表又在北京举行会谈，决定建议各自的政府，一经做好必要的安排，两国就互派大使级的外交代表。同时，两国还就发展经济合作、贸易关系和加强文化交流达成了广泛的协议。在这一协议的基础上，两国贸易代表团去年年底在科伦坡对增加两国贸易、发展技术援助等问题又进行了有益的讨论。事实说明，中锡两国人民之间的友好合作，给两国的经济发展带来了很大好处。我们高兴地看到，两国总理在联合声明中对于进一步加强我们两国之间的团结、发展两国经济合作和文化交流表示了共同的决心。
    中锡两国友好关系的不断发展并不是偶然的。过去我们两国都遭受过殖民主义的苦难，今天又都面临着维护各自的独立、建设自己的祖国和促进世界和平和国际合作的任务。锡兰作为亚非会议的发起国之一，在这个会议上曾同我国及其他亚非国家共同坚持了维护民族独立、争取世界和平、促进国际友好和合作、反对殖民主义的原则。这些原则成为我们两国发展友好合作关系的坚实基础。现在两国总理联合声明中，不仅重新确认了万隆会议的原则，并且把著名的“潘查希拉”——国际和平共处的五项原则，也作为我们的共同理想。这样就使我们两国之间进一步加强友好合作关系，有了更加可靠的保证。
    1955年4月间举行的第一次亚非会议，曾为不同社会制度和政治制度的国家和不同肤色、不同语言、不同信仰的民族之间提供了和平相处的良好范例，从而加强了亚非国家十六亿人民间的友谊和合作，加强了亚非地区和世界的和平。我们相信，另一次亚非会议的召开，对于具体实现万隆精神的各项原则，对于进一步促进亚非人民的团结、合作和缓和国际局势，都将是十分有益的。因此，我国人民对两国声明中关于在适当的最早时候召开另一次亚非会议的建议，表示衷心的支持和拥护。
    大家知道，由于殖民主义长期统治的恶果，在亚非国家的互相关系中，曾遗留下一些悬而未决的问题。殖民主义者正企图利用这些问题，破坏亚非国家的团结，在这些国家之间制造不和，挑起冲突，以达到它们恢复殖民统治的目的。由于这个缘故，亚非各国根据互相信任和谅解的精神，通过友好协商的途径，争取和平解决这些问题，是符合有关各国人民的共同利益，也是符合这个地区的和平利益的。正是从这种善意的、真诚的共同愿望出发，中锡两国总理在联合声明中表示了对于解决克什米尔问题的意见。
    埃及和整个中东的局势，是当前世界各国人民所十分关心的问题。殖民主义者正以所谓“填补真空”的说法，在中东地区进行新的侵略活动，企图用一个强国来代替另一个强国。中锡两国总理联合声明指出，殖民主义者的这种做法是不能解决这个地区的问题的，而只有让中东地区的人民根据他们自己的意志来决定自己的命运，才能保证这个地区的和平。中锡两国总理的这个立场，是对中东各国人民的民族独立运动的有力支持。
    这次以周总理为首的我国政府代表团访问锡兰，对于促进中锡两国的友谊已经获得了令人满意的结果。我们相信：在今后日益增多的接触和往来中，一定能把我们两国的友好合作关系更好地推向前进。中锡两国人民将同亚非各国人民一起，为维护世界和平和促进国际合作事业共同努力。
