Xinhua News Agency, February 16th dispatch: According to TASS on the 15th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session on the 13th and 14th.

The plenary session listened to and discussed the report made by Khrushchev on further improving the organizational work of managing industry and construction, and adopted a corresponding resolution based on the report at the meeting on the 14th.

The resolution, based on Khrushchev's report, states that our country unswervingly implements Lenin's plan for communist construction. During the years of Soviet power, it has surpassed many capitalist countries in terms of economic development and ranks second in the world in terms of industrial production level. Compared with the pre-revolutionary period, Soviet industrial production in 1957 increased more than thirty times, and nearly four times compared with 1940.

Due to the development of the socialist economy, it is necessary to continuously improve the organizational forms and methods of planning and managing industry and construction. Further improvement of the organization of national economic management is of great significance for continuously increasing production, increasing people's welfare, and more fully utilizing the potential of the national economy.

The resolution points out that in the early years of the establishment of Soviet power, Lenin determined that the principle of democratic centralism was the most important principle of the socialist economy, and that socialist construction could only be carried out smoothly on the basis of a unified national plan. The history of the development of the Soviet national economy has proved the great vitality of Lenin's principle, which has opened up unlimited possibilities for the masses of the people to actively participate in production management.

The resolution says that in the post-war years, our country's national economy has taken a big step forward and embarked on a new and higher stage of development. In the process of socialist economic development, the trend of establishing new industrial and construction departments and the trend of further and more profound specialization are growing. This is due to the development of new technologies, the tasks of technological progress, and the new scientific achievements that have caused tremendous qualitative changes in the organization of modern industrial production. This increasingly raises the question of whether to continue to adopt the policy of further subdividing technology, economy, and administrative management in the organizational form of leading industry, and continuously establishing new specialized departments and agencies in the central government in charge of various departments, or to seek more flexible forms of national economic management that are more fully adapted to the characteristics of the current stage of development.

The resolution then talked about the major existing shortcomings in economic management, which is the bad influence of departmentalism in the departments in solving the most important economic problems. It weakens and undermines the normal regional connections between enterprises in the same economic region, fails to directly solve economic problems locally, fails to properly utilize existing material, human, and financial resources, and fails to effectively eliminate the shortcomings discovered in the process of implementing the national plan. Departmentalism also hinders the widespread implementation of production specialization and collaboration, and creates difficulties for the overall development of the economy of various economic regions, republics, border areas, and states. As a result, the enormous productive forces of enterprises are not fully utilized, causing extremely unreasonable material allocation. The lack of coordination between departments in leading construction has led to the establishment of a large number of small construction units in one region, dispersing and freezing national construction funds, and leading to high costs.

The current management structure not only separates a large number of capable production organizers and engineering and technical personnel with complete practical knowledge from direct production, making a large part of them sit in offices, but also limits the potential of local party, Soviet, and trade union organizations in leading economic construction, and suppresses their initiative to mobilize the strength of enterprises and economic organizations to more fully and correctly utilize local potential.

The resolution says that at present, there are more than 200,000 industrial enterprises and more than 100,000 construction projects across the Soviet Union, distributed in various republics and vast areas of the country. It is practically impossible for a department or competent authority to provide specific and effective leadership for such a large number of enterprises and construction projects.

In order to further develop the national economy, it is necessary to improve the organizational form of management in all links of industry and construction. At the same time, the principle of the organizational structure of industrial and construction management should be the combination of national centralized leadership and the improvement of the role of local economic, party, and trade union organizations in economic management. The focus of direct leadership of industry and construction should be shifted to the local level.

The resolution pointed out the benefits of implementing the new form of management structure, saying that it can eliminate and rectify many of the above-mentioned chaotic economic situations, and will also help the development of science, help improve the use of scientists and experts, and the allocation of scientific research and educational institutions, and will be able to ensure further strengthening of the principles of democratic centralism and planning in the leadership of the national economy.

Based on the above situation, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made the following decisions:

1.  It is deemed necessary to implement measures to further improve the management of industry and construction, so that industry and construction can adapt to the tasks and requirements of the national economy in the current stage of communist construction. In view of the fact that the current form of managing industry and construction through specialized departments has led to isolation between various agencies, a new form of leading economic construction should be formulated to replace this form, so as to more fully combine specific and direct leadership of economic regions with strict adherence to the centralized planning principles nationwide.
2.  The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union are instructed to formulate specific proposals for reorganizing the leadership of industry and construction in accordance with the above-mentioned guidelines, and submit them to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for review.

When formulating practical measures, it is necessary to improve the role of the Soviet State Planning Committee in planning work and national national economic leadership, reorganize the work of the State Economic Committee, improve the level of engineering and technical leadership of industry and construction, implement correct technical policies nationwide; improve the role of financial organs in financial work and mobilizing funds to ensure the further upsurge of the national economy; ensure supervision over obedience to national interests and state discipline; improve the work of central and local state supervision organs, and further strengthen the entire national statistical system.

In order to strengthen the planning principles in the development of the national national economy, it is necessary to fundamentally reorganize the work of the Soviet State Planning Committee, so that it can rely on the institutions established in various economic regions in its work, and promptly submit the most important long-term issues to the government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for research. The State Planning Committee should, in line with the party's general line of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and proceeding from the specific conditions of industrial development in various regions, the established specialties of various regions and their development prospects, strive to correctly and rationally allocate industries, develop various industrial sectors proportionally, and implement specialization and collaboration.

It is necessary to streamline the structure of the National Economic Committee; its task, in addition to annual planning work, is to coordinate the work of the management organs of various economic regions in implementing the annual plan.

In order to ensure the constant technological progress in the development of the national economy, consideration should be given to establishing a special agency in the Soviet government; its task is to pay attention to the direction and level of technological development at home and abroad, to deeply study everything fresh and progressive in technology, to formulate suggestions for further improving technology, and to submit them to the government for discussion and implementation of other measures.

In addition, it is also necessary to fundamentally change the content and methods of implementing state supervision, so that the main supervision work is concentrated in various economic regions, in order to discover and eliminate shortcomings in the work of state and economic organs on the spot, and the supervision organs should rely on the broad masses of working people in their entire activities.

### 决定改善生产组织和经济管理形式

    苏共中央全会听取赫鲁晓夫的报告
    决定改善生产组织和经济管理形式
    经济管理方面目前大缺点是各部的本位主义和大批熟练干部脱离直接生产；工业和建设管理的组织结构的原则应当是国家集中领导同提高地方在经济管理中的作用相结合；对工业和建设的直接领导的重心应当转到地方上。应当制定新的领导经济的形式来代替现行的通过专业部管理的形式。
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社15日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会在13日和14日举行了全体会议。
    全体会议听取和讨论了赫鲁晓夫所作的关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作的报告，并且在14日会议上根据报告通过了相应的决议。
    这个根据赫鲁晓夫的报告作出的决议说，我国坚持不渝地执行列宁的共产主义建设计划，在苏维埃政权的年代中在经济发展方面超过了许多资本主义国家，在工业生产水平上居世界第二位。与革命前的时期相比，苏联工业生产量到1957年增为三十多倍，同1940年相比差不多增为四倍。
    由于社会主义经济的发展，就有必要不断改善计划以及管理工业和建设的组织形式和方法。而进一步改善管理国民经济的组织，对不断地提高生产和增加人民福利以及更加充分地利用国民经济的潜力具有重大的意义。
    决议指出，还在苏维埃政权建立的头几年，列宁就确定了民主集中制原则是社会主义经济最重要的原则，只有在统一的国家计划的基础上才可能顺利地进行社会主义建设。苏联国民经济的发展历史证实了列宁的这个原则的伟大生命力，它给人民群众积极参加生产管理开辟了无限的可能性。
    决议说，在战后年代中，我国的国民经济向前迈进了一大步，走上了新的、更高的发展阶段。在社会主义经济发展过程中，建立新的工业和建设部门的趋势、走向进一步更加深刻的专业化的趋势越来越大。这是由于新技术的发展、由于技术进步的任务、由于在组织现代工业生产中引起巨大的质的变化的科学新成就而产生的。这样就日益迫切地提出这样的问题：在领导工业的组织形式方面继续采取把技术、经济和行政管理分得更细、而在中央不断设立新的专业化的主管各种部门的部、署这种方针呢，还是寻求更加灵活的、更充分适应现阶段发展特点的国民经济管理形式。
    决议接着谈到了经济管理方面现存的大缺点是各部在解决最重要的经济问题上所存在的本位主义的坏影响。它削弱和破坏了在同一经济区域的各企业之间的正常地区联系，不能就地直接解决经济问题，不能妥善利用现有的物力、人力和财力，不能有效地消除执行国家计划过程中所发现的缺点。本位主义还妨害了广泛实行生产的专业化和协作，使各经济地区、共和国、边疆区和州的经济的全盘发展产生困难。结果，各企业巨大的生产力得不到充分的利用，引起物资调拨的极不合理现象。在领导建设方面部和部之间的脱节现象，导致了在一个地区设立大量小的建设单位，分散和冻结国家的建设资金，导致了造价高昂。
    现在的管理结构不仅使大批有完备的实际知识的干练的生产组织者和工程技术人员脱离了直接生产，使很大一部分人坐在办公室里，而且限制了地方党、苏维埃和工会组织在领导经济建设方面的潜力，压抑了它们动员企业和经济组织的力量来更充分更正确地利用当地潜力的积极性。
    决议说，现在，苏联全国的工业企业共有二十万个以上，建筑工程有十万个以上，它们分布在各个共和国和全国广大区域内，这样大量的企业和建筑工程要由一个部或主管机关来作具体而有效的领导实际上是不可能的。
    为了进一步发展国民经济，必须在工业和建设的一切环节中改善管理的组织形式。同时，工业和建设管理的组织结构的原则，应当是国家集中领导同提高地方经济、党和工会机构在经济管理中的作用相结合。对工业和建设的直接领导的重心应当转到地方上。
    决议在谈到实行管理结构的新形式的好处时指出，它可以消除和整顿上述许多混乱的经济状况，还将有助于科学的发展，有助于改进对科学家、专家的力量的使用以及科学研究和教育机构的配置，并且能够保证进一步加强国民经济领导中的民主集中制原则和计划原则。
    根据上述情况，苏共中央全体会议作出下面的决定：
    一、认为有必要实行措施来进一步改善工业和建设的管理，使工业和建设适应国民经济在共产主义建设现阶段中的任务和要求。鉴于现行的通过专业部管理工业和建设的形式导致了各机关之间的隔阂，应当制定新的领导经济建设的形式来代替这种形式，以便使对经济地区的具体和直接的领导同严格遵守全国范围的集中计划原则更充分地结合起来。
    二、责成苏共中央主席团和苏联部长会议拟定按照上述方针对工业和建设的领导进行改组的具体建议，并且提交苏联最高苏维埃审查。
    在拟定实际措施时必须提高苏联国家计划委员会在计划工作和国家国民经济领导中的作用，改组国家经济委员会的工作，提高对工业和建设的工程技术领导水平，在全国范围实行正确的技术政策；提高财政机关在财政工作和动员资金以保证国民经济进一步高涨方面的作用；保证对服从全国利益和国家纪律的监督；改善中央和地方国家监督机关的工作，进一步加强整个国家统计系统。
    为了加强国家国民经济发展中的计划原则，必须根本改组苏联国家计划委员会的工作，使它可以在工作中依靠在各经济区域中建立的机构，及时地把最重要的远景问题提交政府和苏共中央研究。国家计划委员会应当本着党的优先发展重工业的总路线，并且从各个地区的工业发展具体条件、各地区业已形成的专业和它们发展的前景出发，致力于正确和合理地配置工业、按比例发展各个工业部门，实行专业化和协作。
    必须精简国家经济委员会的机构；它的任务除了年度计划工作以外就是协调各经济区域管理机关执行年度计划的工作。
    为了保证国民经济发展中的经常技术进步，考虑在苏联政府中设立一个专门机构；它的任务是注意国内外技术发展方向和水平，深入研究技术中一切新鲜、进步的事物，拟定关于进一步改善技术的建议，并且提交政府讨论和实行其他措施。
    另外，还必须根本改变实行国家监督的工作内容和方法，使主要的监督工作集中在各经济区域，以便就地发现和消除国家和经济机关工作中的缺点，监督机关在其整个活动中应当依靠广大劳动人民群众。
