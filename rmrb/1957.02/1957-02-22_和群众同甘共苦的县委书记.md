    County Party Secretary Who Shares Weal and Woe with the Masses
    Li Peifu
    In Hezheng County, Gansu Province, as soon as you mention "Papa Huo," people will immediately smile and tell you many moving stories about him. Who exactly is "Papa Huo"? In the local area, "Papa" and "Grandpa" are affectionate terms for the elderly people who are most respected, but this "Papa Huo" is not an elderly person, but Huo Shiren, the Hezheng County Party Secretary, who is only forty years old.
    Especially Familiar with People and Understanding of People
    Huo Shiren came to Hezheng County in 1949. During the long seven years, he spent most of his time with the masses. When he first served as the director of the Civil Affairs Section in the county, he spent more than 80% of his time in the countryside. After he became a county leader, due to the many things in the office and frequent meetings outside, his time in the countryside was reduced, but he still spent half of the year living in the countryside. He can recite the names of every path and village in Hezheng County, and knows the geographical environment and climate of each village. He knows which village is suitable for growing which crops and which farming methods are suitable. He is even more especially familiar with people and understands people. He can remember the names of countless people of all ethnic groups (including the names of many women and children). He knows how many liberated peasants and landlords there are in most of the villages. In all the agricultural cooperatives in the county, he knows the family and work situation of all the cooperative directors and most of the production team leaders and above, and can even describe their personalities and specialties. Of course, the masses are even more familiar with him. When he appears in a village, that village becomes lively, and people, young and old, bring their children to see him and talk to him.
    Sharing Weal and Woe with the Masses
    Why do the masses love to approach him so much? In Huo Shiren's own words, it is "not to regard oneself as different from the masses." Whenever Huo Shiren sees the masses on any occasion, he always takes the initiative to talk and shake hands with them. If he is riding a horse, he dismounts from afar. He has always addressed the people of Hezheng County by their age, calling the elderly Grandpa or Papa, old women Grandma, and middle-aged people Brother or Sister-in-law. Therefore, the masses are not restrained when they see him, saying that he is "amiable and kind, terribly good (very)." When he goes to the countryside to eat, he eats at whichever house he encounters and eats whatever is available, never letting the masses cook for him separately. The masses have long been familiar with this habit of his. Once, an old Hui man secretly slaughtered a "small chicken" (a food that local people use to entertain distinguished guests) for him behind his back. When he found out, he hurried to stop him. The old man put on a stern face and said angrily, "Our lives are better now, not like in the past. If you don't eat this small chicken this time, I will really be angry!" Only then did he reluctantly kill a small chicken. Huo Shiren goes to the countryside very casually. He leaves as soon as he says he will, sometimes without even bringing a bedding. He puts on a tattered coat, finds a place and sleeps for the night. The year before last, he went to Diaotan Township in Hezheng County to inspect work. The township had just built a sanatorium, and the houses were empty. The township cadres wanted to invite him to stay in a good house, but he refused to go no matter what. Later, he found the poorest family in the whole village and stayed there. There was only half a mat on the kang, and he stayed here.
    The cadres and masses of Hezheng County all know that it is difficult to find "Papa Huo" in the office. He is used to talking and laughing with the masses while working with tools, whether it is threshing, pounding the foundation, plowing the fields, or weeding. After the masses have spoken their minds, he tells the masses his opinions. Once, he was weeding with everyone in a production team in the Caotan Cooperative, chatting and laughing. An old woman heard other cooperative members say that he was the County Party Secretary. The old woman curled her lips and smiled, saying, "You are a disgrace, you can't even recognize the County Party Secretary. He is obviously just an ordinary old man, and you insist on calling him the Secretary! Would a County Party Secretary still weed with us?"
    Huo Shiren has always maintained a hard-working and simple lifestyle. Whether it is the clothes he usually wears or the clothes he wears when meeting guests, they are all plain cotton cloth clothes. He has a cloth shirt that he has worn for several years, and the sleeves are rotten, but he still often wears it. The Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, Nian Dexiang, advised him to change it, but he took it off and asked his wife to wash and mend it before wearing it again. He often says: "The lives of the people are not yet rich, we should not detach ourselves from the masses."
    Discovered Problems That Are Not Easily Discovered
    Because Huo Shiren can go deep among the masses and share weal and woe with the masses, he can discover problems that others cannot discover and solve difficulties for the masses in a timely manner. Liang Sanzicheng, a poor peasant in Yumen Village, Xinzhuang Township, had his wife seized by the rogue bully Lu Zhanlin for five years. The masses were angry but dared not speak out, and the township did not know about it. Not long after Huo Shiren arrived in this township, he discovered this matter and immediately reported it to the relevant departments. As a result, the bully Lu Zhanlin was brought to justice, and Liang Sanzicheng and his wife were reunited. On another occasion, a young man died in a peasant family in Gangou Township, leaving only an old grandmother. Seeing that several acres of wheat were about to rot in the ground, no one harvested it. After Huo Shiren learned about it, he immediately took seven or eight cadres to harvest the wheat for the old grandmother.
    In the summer of the year before last, Huo Shiren was in Ancha Township when he saw a group of women weeding without hats. Some were wearing tattered hat circles that did not block the sun, and beads of sweat the size of beans dripped down their faces. He squatted down and weeded with them, asking them why they didn't wear straw hats. The women said they had no spare money. After hearing this, he immediately returned to the township and asked the credit cooperative to find a way to lend the women a sum of money, and each of them bought a new straw hat. They said in unison: "Papa Huo is really a great person! If it weren't for him, we would be sunburned to death and no one would care. Some cadres even laughed at our tattered straw hats as monkey-playing hats!"
    A Good Example for Cadres and the Masses
    Under the influence and leadership of Huo Shiren, a style of hard work, simplicity, humility, and modesty is being established in Hezheng County. Those who live extravagantly, have a floating work style, and are unwilling to go deep into reality and among the masses are being criticized everywhere. And when people criticize these people, they always naturally use "Papa Huo" as an example. Ma Zhenbang, a cadre of the Maijiaji Bank, is a local. After starting work, his life became corrupt, and he spoke less to his local villagers. Some elderly people said with dissatisfaction: "Look at what kind of person Papa Huo is! He has always been very simple, and he speaks and smiles from afar when he sees people. You are just a child, and you can't fit in this street!"

    和群众同甘共苦的县委书记
    李培福
    在甘肃省和政县，只要提起“霍爸”来，人们就会顿时眉开眼笑，滔滔不绝地告诉你许多关于他的动人事例。“霍爸”到底是谁呢？在当地，“爸”和“爷”是对最受人们尊敬的老年人的一种亲昵的称呼，但是，这“霍爸”却并不是老年人，而是年刚四十的中共和政县委书记霍世仁。
    特别熟悉人了解人
    霍世仁是1949年来到和政县的。漫长的七年中，他的大部分时间是和群众在一起度过的。当他最初在县任民政科长时，每年有80％以上的时间都在乡下，作了县的领导工作后，由于机关里事情多，又经常到外边去开会，下乡的时间少了，但一年中他仍然有一半时间生活在农村里。他能够背得出和政县的每条小道和每个村落的名字，熟悉每个村庄的地理环境、气候情况，他知道那个庄子适合种那种庄稼、适合采用那种耕作方法。他更特别熟悉人、了解人。他能够记得数不清楚的各族人民的名字（包括许多妇女和小孩的名字），绝大部分的庄子他都知道有几户翻身农民、有几个地主，在全县的农业社中，他了解全部社主任和大部分生产队长以上干部的家庭情况和工作情况，甚至说得上他们的性格和特长。群众对他当然就更熟悉了。当他在那一个村子出现时，那个村子就热闹起来，人们扶老携幼，拖儿带女来看他，跟他谈话。
    和群众同甘共苦
    群众为什么这样爱和他接近呢？用霍世仁自己的话来说，就是“不要把自己当成与群众不同的人”。霍世仁不论在任何场合里看见群众时，总是主动地和群众搭话、握手，如果是骑着马，老远就下马。他对和政县群众一向是按年龄称呼的，见到老人称阿爷、阿爸，老太婆称阿奶，中年人称阿哥、阿嫂，因此群众见了他都不拘束，说他“和蔼可亲、好得凶（很）”。他到乡下吃饭，碰到那家吃那家的，碰上啥吃啥，从来不让群众单独做饭给他吃。他这个习惯群众早就摸熟了。有一次一位回民老大爷偷偷地背着他给他宰“尕鸡娃”（当地人民招待贵宾的食品），他发觉后急忙跑去制止，老大爷就沉着脸生气地说：“我们的生活过好了，不比往年，这回你再不吃这个尕鸡娃，我真要生气了！”这样，才勉强杀了个小鸡。霍世仁下乡很随便，说走就走，有时连个铺盖都不带，披个破大衣，找个地方连衣一滚就是一夜。前年他到和政县吊滩乡去检查工作，乡上新修了一所疗养院，房子都空着，乡干部想招待他住一次好房子，但他说啥也不去，后来在全庄上最清贫的一家找到了他，炕上只有半块席，他在这里住下了。
    和政县的干部和群众都知道，在办公室里是很难找到“霍爸”的。他习惯在打槤枷的时候、打胡基的时候、犁地的时候、锄田的时候，一面拿着工具干活，一边和群众说笑谈心，等群众把心里话说出来之后，他就把自己的意见说给群众听。有一次，他在草滩社的一个生产队和大家有说有笑地一起锄草，一位老太太听别的社员说他是县委书记，老太太撇撇嘴笑了说：“把你孽障的，连县委书记也看不出来，他明明是个普通老头子，硬说是书记！一个县委书记还和我们一块锄草？”
    霍世仁一直保持着艰苦朴素的生活作风。不管平常穿的还是会客时穿的都是平面棉布的衣服。他有一件布衬衣已穿了好几年，袖子也烂了，但还是经常不离身。县委副书记年得祥同志劝他换一件，他脱下来让妻子洗补一下还要穿。他常说：“现在人民群众的生活还不富裕，我们不应该脱离群众。”
    发现了不容易发现的问题
    由于霍世仁能够深入群众，与群众同甘共苦，所以他能发现别人不能发现的问题，能够给群众及时解决困难。新庄乡玉门村贫农梁三子成的妻子被兵痞恶霸卢占林霸占了五年，群众都敢怒而不敢言，乡上也不知道。霍世仁到了这个乡上不久，发觉了这件事，立即报告了有关部门。结果恶霸卢占林受到法办，梁三子成夫妇重得团聚。另一次，甘沟乡一家农民死了个年青人，只剩了个老奶奶，眼看着几亩麦子要烂在地里了，没人收割，霍世仁知道后，立即带了七八个干部，给这位老奶奶收割了麦子。
    前年夏天，霍世仁在安岔乡时看见一群拔草的妇女没戴帽子，有的顶着个烂帽圈，不遮太阳，豆大的汗珠一行行从她们的脸上往下淌。他当时就蹲下来和她们一起拔草，问她们为什么不戴草帽，妇女说没零钱。他听了后立刻回到乡上让信用社设法贷给妇女们一笔款，每人买了一顶新草帽。她们异口同声地说：“霍爸真是个大好人！不是他，晒死咱们也没人管，有些干部还笑我们戴的这个烂草帽是耍猴的帽子呢！”
    干部和群众的好榜样
    在霍世仁的影响和带动下，和政县正树立着艰苦朴素和谦逊虚心的风尚。那些生活铺张、作风漂浮，不肯深入实际、深入群众的人，到处遭受着指责。而人们批评这些人的时候，总是很自然地用“霍爸”作例子。买家集银行干部马振邦是本地人，参加工作后，生活腐化，见了本地老乡话说得也少了。一些老年人不满意地说：“你看霍爸是怎样个人！他一直都是很朴素，见了人老远就说哩笑哩，把你这么个娃娃，就在这个街上装不下了！”
