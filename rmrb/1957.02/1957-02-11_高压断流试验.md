Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th. The Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory successfully tested the breaking capacity of its BM-35 high-voltage circuit breaker before it was exported to Burma. This was the first high-voltage interruption test conducted in China.

    In the past, due to limitations in technology and equipment, the large high-voltage circuit breakers produced by this factory had to be transported to the Soviet Union for interruption tests, which was inconvenient. This year, the factory decided to conduct the tests themselves. After research by engineers and technicians, thorough preparations were made in advance, and a series of safety measures were taken. The Shenyang Electric Power Administration and other units also assisted in solving the problem of measuring and recording instruments and other equipment. The test was conducted on January 19 within an electric power grid in Liaoning Province. The test proved that the breaking capacity of the BM-35 high-voltage circuit breaker reached 400 MVA and could continuously interrupt the current twice within 0.2 seconds, fully meeting the design standards.

    High-voltage circuit breakers are safety devices that control huge currents, allowing them to be harnessed for production and construction.

    高压断流试验
    据新华社沈阳10日电　沈阳高压开关厂生产的BM—三五型高压断路器，在出口运往缅甸以前，自行试验断路效能成功。在我国是第一次进行这样的高压断流试验。
    过去因为这个厂受到技术、设备条件的限制，生产的大型高压断路器需要运到苏联去做断流试验，往返不便。今年这个厂决定自行试验。经工程技术人员的研究，事先进行了周密的准备，并且采取了一系列的安全措施，沈阳电业管理局等单位也协助解决了测量记录仪器等设备。1月19日在辽宁省的一个电力网内进行试验。试验证明，BM—三五型高压断路器断路容量达到四百兆伏安，在零点二秒的时间内可以连续两次切断电流，完全达到设计标准。
    高压断路器是控制巨大电流的安全装置，通过它可以使电流驯服地为生产建设服务。
