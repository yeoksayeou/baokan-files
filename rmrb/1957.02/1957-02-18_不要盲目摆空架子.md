The proportion of non-production personnel in some factories and mines is really too large. According to statistics from eleven local state-owned factories in Shanxi Province, non-production personnel account for more than 33% of all employees; in twenty-two local state-owned factories and mines in Guizhou Province, non-production personnel account for more than 43% of the total number of production workers. Why are there so many non-production personnel? The main reason is that the leading personnel of some factories like to put on a "big factory show." Their argument is: "Our factory is a modern enterprise, and the number of management personnel must not be too small to be presentable." The Shanghai Joint State-Private Rongfeng Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory used to have only four departments and sixteen staff members. Because it pursued the style of a large enterprise, it has now developed into sixteen departments and one hundred and forty-nine staff members, including ten people in the personnel department alone. Such an organization is already quite large. But the person in charge of this factory also said: "According to the establishment of state-owned factories, we still don't have enough people!" When some factories learn from the experience of other factories, they also regard the size of the establishment and the number of departments as advanced experience, and copy them without analysis.

Does an increase in personnel necessarily mean that work can be done better? Actually, it is not the case. The Rongfeng Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory mentioned above has quite a few people, but many of them have nothing to do, let alone doing anything well. No wonder some workers say: we are so busy that we don't even have time to go to the toilet, while some staff members are so idle that they have nothing to do. The trade union cadres have to do ideological work for them all day long!

Conversely, a small number of enterprise management personnel does not necessarily mean that they cannot do their work well. For example, there is a factory with twenty-seven workers in Wuxi City, and there is only one full-time cadre; a joint state-private knitting factory in Wuxi has one hundred and eighty workers in the whole factory, and there are seven kinds of products produced, but this factory only has ten full-time cadres. They still do all kinds of forms, statistics, and quality inspections. The production tasks of these two factories are completed very well.

It can be seen that putting on a big show and stacking up a lot of people is not a good thing. It is hoped that those enterprise leaders who like to put on a big factory show will earnestly implement the Party and the state's instructions on streamlining institutions and improving efficiency.

    不要盲目摆空架子
    孙光
    有些厂矿的非生产人员比重实在太大了。根据山西省十一个地方国营工厂的统计，非生产人员占全体职工的33％以上；贵州省有二十二个地方国营厂矿，非生产人员占生产工人总数的43％以上。非生产人员为什么这么多呢？主要原因是有些工厂的领导人员喜欢摆“大工厂的架子”。他们的论调是：“我们工厂是现代化企业，管理人员绝不能少得不像样。”上海公私合营荣丰棉纺织印染厂，从前只有四个科室，十六个工作人员。因为追求大企业派头，现在已经发展到十六个科室，一百四十九个工作人员，其中仅人事科就有十个人。这样的机构已经相当庞大了。可是这个厂的负责人还说：“根据国营厂的编制，我们的人还不够呢！”有些工厂，在学习其他工厂经验的时候，也是把人家有多大编制、有几个科室，作为先进经验，不加分析地照办起来。
    是不是人员增多了，工作就可以做得好一点呢？其实不然。前面所说的那个荣丰棉纺织印染厂人倒不少，就是许多人没有事做，更不用说做好什么事了。难怪有的工人说：我们忙得上厕所的工夫都没有，有的职员却闲得没事做。工会干部还得整天给他们做思想工作！
    相反的，企业的管理人员少，并不一定都做不好工作。例如无锡市有一个二十七个工人的工厂，脱产干部只有一个人；无锡的一个公私合营针织厂，全厂有一百八十个工人，生产的产品有七种，可是这个厂只有脱产干部十人。他们照样也做各种表报、统计和进行质量检查。这两个厂的生产任务都完成得很好。
    由此可见，架子摆得很大，人员堆得很多，并不是什么好事情。希望那些喜欢摆大工厂架子的企业领导人员，认真地执行党和国家的关于精简机构、提高效率的指示。
