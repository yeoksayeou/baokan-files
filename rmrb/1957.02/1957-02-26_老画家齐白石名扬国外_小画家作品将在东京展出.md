The Third International Modern Art Exhibition organized by the All-India Fine Arts and Crafts Society opened in New Delhi on the evening of February 23.

Among the 555 exhibits from 29 participating countries are ink paintings by famous Chinese painters such as Qi Baishi and Chen Banding.

The art critic of the "Hindustan Times" wrote that Qi Baishi's magnolia and wisteria made the works of lesser masters pale in comparison. His paintings have natural power, smooth brushwork, and appropriate composition.

The Third World Children's Art Exhibition will be held in Tokyo on May 12. Children from more than 40 countries, including socialist countries, will send their paintings to participate in the exhibition.

The initiators of this exhibition, the "Japan Federation of UNESCO Associations" and a women's group, announced on February 22 that crayon drawings, pencil drawings, watercolors, and oil paintings by children aged four to fourteen are welcome to participate in the exhibition, with the theme "My Mother." About fifty prizes have been prepared.

The first World Children's Art Exhibition was held in May 1955. At the second exhibition held in May 1956, nearly 6,000 children's paintings were exhibited, an increase of more than 1,000 compared to the first exhibition.

    老画家齐白石名扬国外
    小画家作品将在东京展出
    全印美术和工艺协会举办的第三届国际现代艺术展览会2月23日晚间在新德里开幕。
    在来自二十九个参加国的五百五十五件展览品中，有中国著名画家齐白石和陈半丁等人的水墨画。
    “印度斯坦时报”的艺术批评家写道，齐白石画的玉兰花和紫藤使较差的大师们的作品相形见拙。他的画有天然的力量，笔法舒畅，布局恰当。
    5月12日在东京将要举行第三届世界儿童美术展览会。将有包括社会主义国家在内的四十多个国家的儿童把他们的绘画送去参加展览。
    这个展览会的发起者“日本联合国教育、科学及文化组织协会联盟”和一个妇女团体在2月22日宣布，从四岁到十四岁的儿童所画的腊笔画、铅笔画、水彩画和油画都可以参加展览，画题是“我的母亲”。已经准备了五十个左右的奖额。
    世界儿童美术展览会第一次是在1955年5月举行的。在1956年5月举行的第二届展览会上，近六千幅儿童画参加展出，比第一届增加了一千多幅。
