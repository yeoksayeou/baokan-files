    A Shoe Purchaser
    Minsheng
    Zhang Wenjun is a purchasing agent for the Beijing Clothing, Shoes and Hats Company, and his task is to purchase shoes. Because he excellently completed his purchasing tasks, he was recently selected as an advanced worker.
    Purchasing shoes for a purchasing agent in various places is not as easy as buying a pair of shoes in a department store for us. Every time they arrive in a place, they have to search for sources of goods day and night. Since last year, there has been a tight supply of cotton shoes across the country, and purchasing agents have encountered more difficulties in their work. Zhang Wenjun was transferred to work in other places for purchasing for the first time in August last year, and people often answered him like this: "The supply of goods here is also tight." "We don't have any surplus goods." He came back empty-handed the first time. Later, in his work, he gradually realized that to do a good job in purchasing, it is useless to just shout "support the capital" and "guarantee the supply to the capital" every time he arrives in a place. He must first do a good job of investigation and research, and then organize the source of goods according to the actual situation of the local area. In this way, it can avoid random panic buying in the market and avoid the situation where there is stock but cannot be organized. When he went to Tianjin to purchase shoes, he first contacted the Tianjin Shoe Industry Cooperative to understand the production and supply of shoes in Tianjin this year, and to see how much surplus they had in addition to meeting local needs, and how much they could support Beijing. Last winter, when the supply of cotton shoes in Beijing was tight, he ordered 15,000 pairs of cotton shoes from Tianjin alone. In the past six months, he has purchased about 200,000 pairs of shoes to supply the Beijing market.
    Zhang Wenjun maintains close relationships with relevant departments in other places. When he wants to go to a grassroots unit in a certain place for purchasing, he first obtains the consent of the highest relevant leading department in the local area, and only goes down after receiving a letter of introduction. In the purchasing process, he also helps production units solve difficulties. For example, when he went to a shoe production cooperative in Yangliuqing Town, he found that they did not have the blanket raw materials for making cotton shoes, so he went everywhere to find them for them and helped them overcome the difficulties. He also helped some factories and cooperatives improve the style of shoes, and led people from these units to visit shoe stores and department stores to learn good styles.
    In his work, he can flexibly implement the intentions of the leadership according to changes in market conditions. Last year, when the supply of cotton shoes was in short supply, the company sent Zhang Wenjun to Baotou and Zhangjiakou to purchase cotton shoes, and asked him to also sell the accumulated cloth shoe soles. When Zhang Wenjun arrived in Zhangjiakou, he saw that there were many purchasing agents there to purchase cotton shoes, including purchasing agents from Baotou. Zhang Wenjun thought: Baotou must also be short of cotton shoes, otherwise, why would the purchasing agents from Baotou come to Zhangjiakou to buy cotton shoes? The weather in Baotou is colder than in Beijing, and there are many workers. There must be cotton shoes for sale in the Baotou market. If I go to Baotou again, wouldn't that further increase the tension in the supply of cotton shoes there? He decided not to go to Baotou and asked the leadership to send him to Tianjin, Xuzhou and other places for purchasing. When he was selling cloth shoe soles in Zhangjiakou, he found that there was a shortage of raw materials for making shoe soles in the market. He felt that the company's approach of asking him to sell shoe soles in Zhangjiakou was incorrect, because if all these shoe soles were sold out, Beijing might experience a shortage of shoe soles in the future (most of Beijing's shoe soles are imported from other places). He asked the leadership to consider changing this approach. Later, the leadership accepted his opinion, corrected the wrong practice of selling shoe soles, and processed the shoe soles into finished products for sale.
    Zhang Wenjun has been working as a purchasing agent in other places for less than a year. Initially, because he was not familiar with the business, he blindly purchased a lot of shoes based on enthusiasm alone. During the anti-waste and anti-stockpile movement, he was considered to have the most shoes in stock. He was very scared at the time. Later, in addition to appropriately criticizing his shortcomings in work, the section chief also praised his spirit of boldly purchasing goods and placed the main responsibility for causing blind purchasing on himself. During that movement, Zhang Wenjun received a great education and realized that organizing the source of goods must be based on market needs and customer preferences, otherwise, it would cause losses to the country due to incorrect colors and poor quality.
    He also gradually realized that purchasing work is closely related to people's lives, and being a purchasing agent is glorious and the responsibility is significant. He loves his work and often uses holidays to go to department stores and shoe stores to understand customer needs and design new varieties and patterns for the production department. He is very familiar with which regions of customers like which kind of shoes. He knows whether a pair of shoes is good or not and whether it is comfortable to wear by putting his hand inside the shoe. The shoes he purchases are all loved by customers.

    一个采购鞋子的人
    民生
    张文俊，是北京市服装鞋帽公司的采购员，他的任务是采购鞋子。因为他出色地完成了采购任务，最近被选为先进工作者。
    采购员到各地采购鞋子，可不像我们到百货公司买双鞋那么容易。他们每到一个地方，就要日夜不停地去寻找货源。从去年开始，全国各地都有棉鞋供不应求的紧张情况，采购员在工作中遇到的困难也更多。张文俊在去年8月第一次调到外埠做采购工作，常常有人这样回答他：“我们这里的货源也很紧张。”“我们没有什么剩余的货物。”他第一次就是空着手回来。以后，在工作中，他逐渐地体会到：要想做好采购工作，每到一地，空喊要人家“支援首都”“保证首都的供应”是没有用的，必须先做好调查研究工作，然后再根据当地的实际情况组织货源。这样，既可避免在市场上乱抢购，又可避免发生有货而组织不到货的情况。他到天津去采购鞋，便先通过天津鞋业联社了解天津今年鞋的生产和供应情况，看看他们除供应当地需要外尚有多少剩余，可支援北京多少。去年冬季，当北京棉鞋供应紧张的时候，他仅在天津就订购了一万五千双棉鞋回来。半年来，他采购了约二十万双鞋供应北京市场。
    张文俊和外地有关部门保持着亲切的关系。当他要到某地的基层单位去采购的时候，先取得当地最高有关领导部门的同意，拿了介绍信以后才下去。在采购中，他还帮助生产单位解决困难。例如，他到杨柳青镇一个鞋业生产合作社去，发现他们没有做棉鞋的毛毯原料，他便到处去为他们寻找，帮助他们克服了困难。他还帮助一些工厂、合作社改进鞋的样式，带领这些单位的人员到鞋店、百货公司去参观，去学习好的样式。
    在工作中，他能根据市场情况的变化，灵活地执行领导的意图。去年，在棉鞋供不应求的情况下，公司派张文俊到包头、张家口一带采购棉鞋，并且要他附带推销过去积压下来的布鞋底。张文俊到了张家口，见有许多采购员在那里采购棉鞋，其中也有从包头来的采购员。张文俊想：包头的棉鞋一定也很缺少，不然，包头的采购员为什么到张家口买棉鞋呢？包头的天气比北京冷，工人多，包头市场上不能没有棉鞋卖，我要是再到包头去，岂不更助长那里棉鞋供应的紧张情况吗？他决心不到包头去，要求领导上派他到天津、徐州等地去采购。他在张家口推销布鞋底时，发现市场上做鞋底的原料很缺，他便感到公司要他在张家口推销鞋底的做法是不正确的，因为如果把这些鞋底都推销光了，将来北京可能会发生缺乏鞋底的情况（北京的大部分鞋底是靠外埠进货的）。他要求领导上考虑改变这种做法。后来，领导上便接受他的意见，纠正了推销鞋底的错误做法，把鞋底加工成成品出售。
    张文俊担任外埠采购工作不到一年时间。最初，由于他不熟悉业务，单凭热情办事，盲目地进了许多鞋子。在反浪费反积压运动中，算他积压鞋子最多。他当时很害怕。以后，股长除了适当地批评他工作中的缺点外，还表扬了他大胆进货的精神，并把造成盲目进货的主要责任放在自己身上。在那次运动中，张文俊受到了很大的教育，认识到组织货源必须根据市场的需要和顾客的爱好，否则，便会因货色不对路、质量不好而造成国家的损失。
    他也逐渐认识到采购工作和人民的生活是息息相关的，当一个采购员是光荣的，责任是重大的。他热爱自己的工作，常常利用假日到百货公司、鞋店去了解顾客的需要，给生产部门设计新品种花样。他对哪个地区的顾客喜欢哪种鞋子，都很熟悉。他用手伸进鞋里，就知道这双鞋好不好，穿的时候是不是舒服。他采购回来的鞋子，都是顾客所喜爱的。
