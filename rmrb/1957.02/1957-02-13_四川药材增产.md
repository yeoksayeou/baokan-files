Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu – Sichuan Province, a major production area of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, has seen great development in the production of medicinal materials in the past year. The purchase volume of major medicinal materials such as white peony, ophiopogon japonicus, prepared aconite root, and pinellia increased by more than 40% in 1956 compared to 1955. Pinellia saw the largest increase, more than doubling. In addition, forty-five new varieties were discovered that had not been found in the past.

Various departments in different regions have encouraged and assisted farmers in producing various Chinese medicinal materials from all aspects, and have reasonably adjusted some excessively low prices of Chinese medicinal materials, which has greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers for cultivating medicinal materials. In Wanyuan County, after the price of codonopsis pilosula produced there was adjusted, the seedlings cultivated in the seventh district alone increased by thirty-five times. According to statistics from relevant departments, in Yibin, Luzhou, Daxian, Suining and other regions, more than 400,000 plants of medicinal materials such as Evodia rutaecarpa, croton, trifoliate orange, Buddha's hand, and red plum were cultivated last winter and this spring. This year, the planned sowing area of Sichuan lovage and white peony, the main medicinal materials in Sichuan Province, will be doubled compared to last year; the planting area of alisma, ophiopogon japonicus, aconite, and ophiopogon japonicus and other major medicinal materials will be expanded by 50%.

    四川药材增产
    新华社成都电　全国中药材主要产地的四川省，一年来中药材生产有很大发展。主要药材如白芍、麦冬、附片、半夏等，1956年收购量比1955年增加40％以上。半夏增加最多，达两倍以上。此外还有四十五种是过去没有发现的新品种。
    各地有关部门从各方面鼓励和帮助农民生产各种中药材，合理调整了一部分过低的中药材价格，大大提高了农民栽培药材的积极性。万源县出产的党参，调整价格后，仅第七区培育的党参苗就增加了三十五倍。据有关部门统计，宜宾、泸州、达县、遂宁等专区，去冬今春将栽培家种吴于、巴豆、只壳、佛手、红梅等药材四十多万株。今年四川省主要药材川芎、白芍的播种面积，计划将比去年增加一倍；泽泻、玉京、附子、麦冬等主要药材的栽种面积将扩大50％。
