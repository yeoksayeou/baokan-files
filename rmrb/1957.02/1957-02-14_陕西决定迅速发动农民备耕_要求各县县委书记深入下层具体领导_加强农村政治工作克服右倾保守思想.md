Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Electric Dispatch: Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of over fifty county and city Party secretaries from the Qin Chuan area and Shangluo Special District, resolving to swiftly mobilize peasants to exhaust all means to immediately commence spring planting preparation work, ensuring increased agricultural production for the entire province this year.

After detailed analysis and research, the meeting concluded that the conditions for fulfilling this year’s agricultural production increase targets in the province are better than in previous years. The results of agricultural production practice in the past year following agricultural collectivization demonstrate significant growth in agricultural production, and a notable improvement in the consciousness of agricultural cooperative members and the leadership capabilities of cooperative cadres. However, some new problems also emerged in last year’s agricultural production. The main problems are that the management and technical levels of agricultural cooperatives are not yet adapted to the requirements of the current development of large-scale agricultural production, cooperative members are not yet fully accustomed to collective production, and many agricultural cooperatives have not adequately handled the relationships between individual and collective, cooperative and state, and immediate and long-term interests.

The meeting deemed that spring is the most crucial time of year, and all agricultural cooperative members should be vigorously and swiftly mobilized to immediately undertake all spring planting preparation work. Based on Shaanxi Province's actual conditions, four key aspects must be grasped: strengthening wheat field management, preparing and conserving moisture in cotton fields, cultivating strong seedlings in rice-producing areas, and clearing grain stubble in millet-producing areas to prevent insect pests; vigorously mobilizing cooperative members to carry out fertilizer accumulation and search campaigns to ensure the needs for spring wheat topdressing and cotton field base fertilizer; accelerating water conservancy construction, ensuring that projects originally planned to be completed before spring planting are completed on schedule without delaying the agricultural season, and promptly carrying out spring irrigation of farmland in areas where there was little snow and rain last winter and the land is dry to ensure strong wheat seedlings and timely cotton sowing; strengthening livestock work, striving to prevent spring livestock epidemics, and encouraging agricultural cooperatives to breed livestock in all aspects. In addition, during this spring's rectification of cooperatives, efforts must focus on improving labor management and implementing contracting output quotas to ensure proper use of labor, reasonable remuneration, and that production is on the right track.

In order to do the above work well, the meeting believed that all levels of Communist Party organizations in the province should currently strengthen political and ideological work during the agricultural season in order to overcome the current right-leaning conservative thinking among some cadres and peasants and actively launch spring planting preparation work; at the same time, a group of cadres with practical work experience should be mobilized to go deep into the lower levels to lead the spring planting activities of agricultural cooperatives. The meeting also required the heads of Communist Party organizations in each county to directly lead one or two agricultural cooperatives during the spring planting production period, setting an example to call on everyone to learn. When necessary, the secretaries of the Communist Party committees of each county can also concurrently serve as the Party secretary of a township in order to conduct in-depth investigations and research, discover problems, solve problems, and promote work.

    陕西决定迅速发动农民备耕
    要求各县县委书记深入下层具体领导
    加强农村政治工作克服右倾保守思想
    据新华社西安电　最近中共陕西省委员会召开秦川地区和商雒专区五十多个中共县、市委书记会议，决定迅速发动农民想尽千方百计，立即动手做好各项春耕生产准备工作，以保证今年全省农业增产。
    经过详细的分析和研究，会议认为，完成今年全省农业增产任务的条件比过去那一年都好。全省农业合作化以后一年来生产实践的结果，农业生产有了很大的增长，农业社社员的觉悟和社干部的领导能力也都有了显著的提高。但是，在去年的农业生产中，也出现了一些新的问题。主要的问题是农业社的管理水平、技术水平还不能适应目前农业大生产发展的要求，社员群众对于集体生产还不很习惯，许多农业社对于个人和集体、社和国家、眼前和长远的利益之间的关系处理得还不够妥当。
    会议认为，一年之计在于春，当前应大力和迅速发动所有农业社社员立即进行各项备耕工作。根据陕西省的实际情况，必须抓紧四个环节：加强麦田管理、棉田整地保墒、稻产区培育壮苗、谷糜产区掏除谷茬，防止虫害；大力发动社员开展积肥搜肥运动，保证春季麦田追肥和棉田基肥的需要；加紧兴修水利，原计划在春耕前完成的工程保证按期全部完成，不误农时，并且在去冬雪雨稀少、土地干旱的地方及时做好春季农田灌溉工作，保证麦苗健旺和棉花适时下种；加强耕畜工作，尽力防治春季畜疫，从各方面鼓励农业社，繁殖牲畜。此外，在今春的整社工作中，必须以改进劳动管理，以推行包工包产等为中心，使劳动力使用得当，计酬合理，生产走上正轨。
    为了做好上述各项工作，会议认为，全省各级共产党组织目前应当加强农时政治思想工作，以便克服目前一部分干部和农民中的右倾保守思想，积极展开备耕工作；同时应当动员一批有实际工作经验的干部深入下层，领导农业社的备耕活动。会议还要求各县共产党组织的负责人在春耕生产期间直接领导一、两个农业社，做出样子，号召大家学习。各中共县委书记在必要时还可以兼任一个乡的党委书记，以便深入调查研究，发现问题，解决问题，推动工作。
