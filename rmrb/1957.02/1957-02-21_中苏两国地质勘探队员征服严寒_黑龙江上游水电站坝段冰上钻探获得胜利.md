Xinhua News Agency, Mohe, February 20th: The first batch of geological data from the Lian’yin and Jialinda hydropower station dam sections in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River was sent to the Leningrad Hydroelectric Design Institute in mid-February. This marks the victory of the Chinese and Soviet geological prospecting teams in conquering the severe cold of the North.

At the beginning of January this year, four drilling rigs from the Chinese and Soviet geological prospecting teams, on the ice-covered Lian’yin and Jialinda dam sections, opened four riverbed boreholes and began ice drilling work on the Heilongjiang River. The two Soviet drilling rigs, operated by experienced captains and drillers, maintained high-speed drilling efficiency from the start, averaging about three meters per shift. Chinese drillers, drilling on ice for the first time, quickly mastered ice drilling techniques with the enthusiastic help of the Soviet captains, and the drilling efficiency averaged 2.5 meters per shift. These four boreholes were completed in early February after more than thirty days and nights of work by the Chinese and Soviet prospecting teams.

The first batch of riverbed geological data obtained by the Chinese and Soviet geological prospecting teams in these four boreholes was analyzed and compiled by geologists from both the Chinese and Soviet teams. During the data compilation process, Gao Liangsi, the chief geologist of the Soviet team, unreservedly introduced the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in compiling geological data to the Chinese geologists. Under the intense work of the Chinese and Soviet geologists, the geological data from these four boreholes have been drawn into beautiful core columnar diagrams and sent to the Leningrad Hydroelectric Design Institute in mid-February.

Now, the Chinese and Soviet geological prospecting teams, who have achieved victory in ice drilling, have set up drilling rigs on the Lian’yin and Jialinda dam sections and are drilling towards new ice boreholes.

Xinhua News Agency, Mohe, February 20th: Following the ice drilling on the Lian’yin and Jialinda hydropower station dam sections, the ice drilling work on another dam section—the Amacha’er hydropower station—in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, also began by the Chinese and Soviet prospecting teams working in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River. They will select a high dam site line on the twelve-kilometer-long dam section.

At present, the climate in the Mohe area is still below minus 30 degrees Celsius. On the cold riverbed, the Chinese and Soviet prospecting teams are drilling through the 1.5-meter-thick ice layer into the hard riverbed rock with four drilling rigs. The experienced Soviet drilling team is using the latest Soviet 500-meter automatic drilling rig; while the young Chinese drilling team, in addition to the two crews who participated in the earlier ice drilling on the Lian’yin and Jialinda hydropower station dam sections and gained some experience, another crew has just arrived from Sichuan. Three more drilling rigs from the Chinese and Soviet drilling teams will start work in the coming days.

According to the preliminary plan of the Heilongjiang River Basin Plan, Amacha’er has been determined as the first-stage developed hydropower station.

    中苏两国地质勘探队员征服严寒
    黑龙江上游水电站坝段冰上钻探获得胜利
    新华社漠河20日电　黑龙江上游连崟、加林达水电站坝段的第一批地质资料，已经在2月中旬送往列宁格勒水电设计院。这是中苏两国地质勘探队员征服北方严寒的胜利的标志。
    今年1月初，中苏两国地质勘探队的四台钻机，在冰雪覆盖的连崟、加林达坝段上，凿开四个河床钻孔，开始了黑龙江上的冰上钻探工作。苏联的两台钻机，是由有经验的机长和钻工操纵的，从开始就保持了高速钻进的效率，平均每班都在三公尺左右。初次在冰上钻探的中国钻工们，在苏联机长的热情帮助下，也迅速地掌握了冰上钻探技术，钻进效率每班平均达到了二点五公尺。这四个钻孔，经过中苏勘探队员三十多个昼夜的劳动，在2月初已先后打完了。
    中苏两国地质勘探队员在这四个钻孔里获得的第一批河床地质资料，由中苏两队的地质师进行了分析和整理。在整理资料过程中，苏联队总地质师高良斯基将苏联整理地质资料的先进经验，毫无保留的介绍给中国地质师。在中苏两队地质师的紧张工作下，这四个钻孔的地质资料，已绘制成美丽的岩心柱状图，在2月中旬送往列宁格勒水电设计院去了。
    现在，获得冰上钻探胜利的中苏两国地质勘探队员们，又在连崟、加林达坝段上架起钻机，向着新的冰上钻孔钻进了。
    新华社漠河20日电　工作在黑龙江上游的中苏两国勘探队员，继连崟、加林达水电站坝段冰上钻探之后，又一个坝段——阿玛查尔水电站的冰上钻探工作也开始了。他们将在十二公里长的坝段上，选择一条高坝坝址线。
    现在，漠河地区的气候仍在零下三十多度，中苏两国勘探队员们在寒冷的河床上，四台钻机穿透了一点五公尺厚的冰层，向坚硬的河床岩石钻进。有经验的苏联钻探队员，他们使用着苏联最新式五百公尺自动钻机；而年轻的中国钻探队员们，除了有两个机组参加过先期开工的连崟、加林达水电站坝段的冰上钻探，获得一些经验外，另外一个机组是刚从四川赶来的。中苏钻探队不日将还有三台钻机动工。
    根据黑龙江流域规划初步方案，确定阿玛查尔为第一期开发的水电站。
