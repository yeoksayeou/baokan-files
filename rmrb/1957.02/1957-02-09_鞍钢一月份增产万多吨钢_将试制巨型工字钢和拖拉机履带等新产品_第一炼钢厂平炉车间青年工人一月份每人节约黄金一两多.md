Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 8th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the state plan in January, increasing production of high-quality steel by over 11,000 tons. Thirteen major products, including steel materials, iron ore, and metallurgical coke, also exceeded their January targets.

Steel workers overcame the severe cold and difficulties in raw material supply to achieve new successes. Workers at the First Steel Plant strengthened furnace maintenance, increasing the number of furnaces for rapid steelmaking by more than 100 compared to the previous month. The smelting time for each furnace of steel was shortened by another 37 minutes compared to December of last year, creating the highest monthly steel production record since the plant's opening, with steel production increasing by more than 20,000 tons compared to the same period last year.

The First Primary Rolling Mill reorganized its organizational structure in January, strengthened the ranks of grassroots cadres in the workshops, and improved technical management, resulting in a significant increase in steel rolling capacity. In January, it set two new steel rolling production records. The production of steel billets this month was also the highest since the plant's opening, increasing by 30.9% compared to the same period last year.

This month, miners at the Dagushan Iron Mine braved the severe cold, working day and night in the snow-covered open-pit mine, increasing ore production by more than 20,000 tons for the country. Total monthly production increased by 229,000 tons compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 8th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company plans to trial produce the first batch of forty-three new products this year. These new products are being trial-produced based on the needs of China's machinery manufacturing, geological exploration, transportation, and construction industries.

Among the new products Anshan Iron and Steel plans to trial produce this year are giant I-beams for building large factories and bridges, tractor tracks, steel piles for building docks and reinforcing foundations, steel plates for manufacturing automobile beams, bulb flats for making keels in the shipbuilding industry, large Z-beams for manufacturing locomotives and rolling stock, heavy-duty steel rails with a load capacity of over 120 tons, and various types of steel ropes with multiple strands and large diameters.

Currently, the technical personnel at Anshan Iron and Steel responsible for new product development are accelerating the preparation of trial production procedures. In the roll pass design office of the Chief Rolling Engineer, the roll passes needed for rolling more than ten new products, such as tractor tracks, are about to be completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 8th: Youth steelworkers in the open hearth furnace workshop of the First Steel Plant saved over 20,000 yuan worth of wealth in January, equivalent to an average of more than one tael of gold per person.

The youth workers in this workshop, together with the veteran workers, launched an increase production and practice economy campaign at the beginning of the year. They summarized the advanced examples of youth steelworkers Ning Yongcai and Wu Yongfa in not claiming tools for a year and cherishing state property, helped open hearth furnace workers who had wasted tools in the past to find the reasons, and formulated conservation measures. Wang Xian, a youth supervisor on the No. 8 open hearth furnace, used to be indifferent to the waste of materials when repairing furnaces, but since January, he has carefully collected more than 200 jin of scattered refractory materials after each furnace repair. Communist Youth League member Cui Zhinian and youth workers collected dolomite scattered on the platform, recovering two tons in January. In particular, after carefully learning from the experience of the youth furnace repair team of Class B in unity and mutual assistance, the furnace repair team of Class C not only saved more than 1,000 jin of furnace repair materials each time but also shortened the furnace repair time.

    鞍钢一月份增产万多吨钢
    将试制巨型工字钢和拖拉机履带等新产品
    第一炼钢厂平炉车间青年工人一月份每人节约黄金一两多
    新华社鞍山8日电　鞍山钢铁公司1月份为国家超计划增产了一万一千多吨优质钢。钢材、铁矿石、冶金焦等十三种主要产品也都超额完成了1月份的计划。
    钢铁工人们克服了严寒和原料供应的困难，创造了新的成绩。第一炼钢厂的工人加强炉体维护工作，使快速炼钢的炉数比前一个月增加一百多炉，每一炉钢的熔炼时间比去年12月份又缩短三十七分钟，创造了开厂以来月产钢量的最高纪录，比去年同期的钢产量增加了两万多吨。
    第一初轧厂在1月份重新调整组织机构，加强车间基层干部的力量，并且改进技术管理工作，使轧钢能力有了显著提高。在1月份创造了两次轧钢产量的新纪录。这个月生产的钢坯也是开厂以来最高的一个月，比去年同期的产量增加30.9％。
    这个月里，大孤山铁矿的矿工们冒着严寒，在白雪皑皑的露天矿场上不分昼夜地劳动，为国家增产了两万多吨矿石，全月产量比去年同期增加了二十二万九千吨。
    新华社鞍山8日电　鞍山钢铁公司今年第一批准备试制四十三种新产品。这些新产品是根据我国机械制造、地质钻探、交通运输和建筑工业的需要而试制的。
    鞍钢今年计划试制的新产品中，有建筑巨大厂房和桥梁用的巨型工字钢，制造拖拉机的履带，建筑码头和加固地基的钢桩，制造汽车大梁的钢板，造船工业中制作龙骨的球平钢材，制造机车车辆的大型乙字钢，负荷能力在一百二十吨以上的吊重钢轨，还有股数多、直径大的多种多样的钢绳。
    现在，鞍钢管理新产品工作的技术人员正在加紧编制新产品的试制规程。在总轧钢师孔型设计室里，轧制拖拉机履带等十多种新产品所需要的轧辊孔型就要设计完成了。
    新华社鞍山8日电　鞍钢第一炼钢厂平炉车间青年炼钢工人在1月份节约了价值两万多元的财富，折合黄金，平均每人节约了一两多。
    这个车间的青年工人和老工人们一道，从年初就展开了增产节约运动。他们总结了青年炼钢工人宁永才、吴永发一年不领工具和爱护国家财产的先进事例，帮助过去在使用工具方面浪费的平炉工人找出原因，订出了节约措施。八号平炉青年监督岗员王宪，过去看见补炉浪费材料也不关心，但是1月份以来，每补完一次炉他总要细心地收回两百多斤零星的耐火材料。青年团员崔志年和青年工人一起把散落在平台上的白云石收集起来，在1月份就回收了两吨。特别是丙班补炉队，认真学习乙班青年补炉队团结互助的经验后，不但每次节约一千多斤补炉材料，还缩短了补炉时间。
