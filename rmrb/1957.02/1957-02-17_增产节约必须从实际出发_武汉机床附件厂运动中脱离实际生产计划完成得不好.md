Increased Production and Thrift Must Proceed from Reality
Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory's Movement Deviated from Reality, Production Plans Poorly Completed

According to the Changjiang Daily, the Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory, in carrying out the increased production and thrift movement, failed to grasp the characteristics of the factory and integrate them with current production. The production plans since January have been poorly completed: although the total output value and labor productivity plans for January were overfulfilled, the commodity output value only reached 85.15%, and the output only reached 50.7%. Currently, the situation of completing the plans has not improved.

A large part of the factory's products in the first quarter are new products, screws and nuts. Preparations for the production of new products should have been completed before December of last year. However, at that time, the factory leaders focused all their energy on completing the annual plan, and relaxed the production technology preparation work for this year. Only after the new products were put into production this year did they find that the process regulations and process equipment for the new products were out of touch with production reality in many places. As a result, tens of thousands of screws and nuts could not continue to be processed, causing some workers to be idle.

The factory launched a mass inspection of waste in November of last year. After launching the increased production and thrift movement this year, it also made two reports to the workers and formulated an increased production and thrift plan. However, the characteristics of this year's movement and the characteristics of the factory were not clear. The savings plans of each workshop only required saving a certain amount of expenses such as machine oil, cotton yarn, and light bulbs. Although the factory's plan put forward requirements for saving raw materials, saving expenses, equipment maintenance, streamlining institutions, etc., it was unclear what the focus was. The plan was not submitted to the masses for discussion after it was formulated. As a result, the increased production and thrift movement was launched in form, but production problems could not be solved. Even after the problems occurred, the leadership did not take timely measures and delayed solving them for a few days. It was not until the workshop could not maintain production that old products were put into production.

### 增产节约必须从实际出发  武汉机床附件厂运动中脱离实际生产计划完成得不好

    增产节约必须从实际出发
    武汉机床附件厂运动中脱离实际生产计划完成得不好
    据长江日报讯　武汉机床附件厂在开展增产节约运动中，没有抓住本厂特点和当前生产相结合，1月份以来的生产计划完成得很不好：1月份总产值和劳动生产率计划虽然超额完成了，但是商品产值只完成了85.15％，产量仅仅完成50.7％，目前，完成计划情况也没有好转。
    这个工厂第一季度的大部分产品是新产品螺钉螺帽。生产新产品的准备工作，应该在去年12月以前就做好。但是，当时厂里领导人员全部精力集中于完成全年计划，放松了今年的生产技术准备工作。等到今年新产品投入生产后，才发现新产品的工艺规程和工艺装备等工作，许多地方和生产实际脱节。因此有几万个螺钉、螺帽不能继续加工，造成部分工人窝工。
    厂里在去年11月份曾经发动群众检查浪费，今年开展增产节约运动后，也向职工作了两次报告，制定了增产节约方案。但是，对今年开展运动的特点和本厂的特点不明确。各车间的节约方案只是要求节约多少机油、棉纱、灯泡之类的经费开支。全厂的方案，对于节约原材料、节省开支、设备保养、精简机构等各方面虽然都提出了要求，可是，重点是什么不明确。方案制定后也没有交给群众讨论。结果，增产节约运动形式上是开展起来了，生产上的问题却不能解决。甚至在问题发生以后，领导上也未及时采取措施，拖了几天没有解决。直到车间不能维持生产了，才把老产品投入生产。
