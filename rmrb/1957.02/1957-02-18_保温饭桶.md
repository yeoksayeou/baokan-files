    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 15th -- The Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways recently manufactured an insulated lunch box for field surveyors. This lunch box is divided into four layers internally. The top layer has two dish plates, the second layer holds rice, the third layer and the surrounding wall of the lunch box are a hot water container, and the bottom layer is divided into four compartments: two compartments for bowls and chopsticks, one for charcoal, and one for a stove. When the stove is lit, it can maintain the temperature of the hot water inside the container, heating the food in the first and second layers. This ensures that field surveyors and night shift workers who are far from their residences or unable to leave their posts can have hot dishes and hot rice at any time.
    This insulated lunch box is designed to provide meals for fifteen people per unit. It is cylindrical, five decimeters high, and three point eight decimeters in diameter. The entire structure is mostly made of galvanized iron. The exterior is wrapped with a layer of brown skin, and eight iron rings are installed at the top and bottom edges, making it easy to carry or transport on the back.

    保温饭桶
    新华社成都15日电　铁道部第二设计院最近为野外勘测人员制造了一种保温饭桶。这种饭桶内部分为四层，上层是两个菜盘，第二层盛饭，第三层和饭桶的四周夹壁是开水桶，底下一层又分为四格：两格装碗筷，一格装木炭，一格装火炉。火炉燃烧起来就可以保持住桶内的开水温度，使第一、二两层的饭菜受热。这样就可以保证远离住地或离不开工作岗位的野外勘测人员和夜班工作人员，随时都能吃到热菜、热饭。
    这种保温饭桶是按每只供应十五人的用餐量设计的。它是圆柱形，有五公寸高，直径为三点八公寸，全部结构绝大部分用白铁皮制成。它的外围包有棕皮一层，上下边缘处安装铁环八个，挑运或背运都很方便。
