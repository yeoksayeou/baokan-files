Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 8th: Eleven veteran workers from Zhengzhou who participated in the "February 7th" strike have been giving reports on the course of the "February 7th" revolutionary struggle to youth in factories, schools, and government offices. So far, 30,000 young workers and students have received education in revolutionary traditions by listening to their reports.

Among the "February 7th" veteran workers who are giving reports to the youth are Jiang Haishi, the former Vice Chairman of the Zhengzhou Branch of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Trade Union and current Deputy Director of the Zhengzhou "February 7th" Memorial Hall, and Lin Maoxiang, the former leader of the Jiang'an Trade Union group, current Vice Chairman of the Zhengzhou District Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, and cousin of martyr Lin Xiangqian. They are all around sixty years old, and to meet the demands of the broad masses of youth, they have given up their rest time. Five veteran workers from the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration have also gone to Xinxiang, Xuchang, Luohe, Kaifeng and other places to give reports to the youth.

The reports of the veteran workers have aroused the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young workers. After listening to the reports of the veteran workers, 3,000 young workers from the Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1 collectively swore an oath: we must not fear difficulties, nor covet ease and comfort, and resolutely be good successors to the older generation. Many workers from the Zhengzhou Meat Processing Plant said after listening to the reports: the revolutionary veterans shed blood and sacrificed themselves to create happiness for our generation, and we must also work hard to create a better life for the next generation.

In the past, factories, government offices, and schools in Zhengzhou often invited "February 7th" veteran workers to give reports. Last year, more than 100,000 people in the city heard their reports.

    郑州“二七”老工人不辞劳苦作报告
    三万青年受到革命传统教育
    新华社郑州8日电　郑州市十一名参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人，连日来分头向各工厂、学校、机关的青年报告“二七”革命斗争的经过，到目前已经有三万名青年职工和学生从听他们的报告中受到了革命传统的教育。
    在向青年们作报告的“二七”老工人中，有当年担任京汉铁路总工会郑州分会副会长、现任郑州“二七”纪念堂副主任姜海世，当年的江岸工会小组长、现任中国铁路工会郑州区委员会副主席、烈士林祥谦的堂弟林茂湘。他们都是六十岁左右的人了，为了满足广大青年们的要求，都放弃了自己的休息时间。在郑州铁路管理局郑州机务段工作的五位老工人，还到新乡、许昌、漯河、开封等地向青年们作报告。
    老工人的报告激起了广大青年职工们的热情。郑州国棉一厂三千名青年职工在听了老工人的报告后，集体宣誓：一定要不怕困难、不贪图安逸享受，坚决做好上一代的接班人。郑州肉类加工厂的许多职工在听了报告后都说：革命老前辈流血牺牲为我们这一代创造了幸福，我们也要努力工作，为下一代创造更加美好的生活。
    郑州市各工厂、机关、学校过去经常邀请“二七”老工人作报告，去年一年全市有十万多人听到了他们的报告。
