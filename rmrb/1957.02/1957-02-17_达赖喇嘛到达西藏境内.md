Xinhua News Agency, Yadong, 16th: The Dalai Lama, having concluded his visit to India and Sikkim, returned to Chinese Tibetan territory on the 15th from the Chun Valley in Sikkim, heading north along the Himalayas.

At noon on the 15th, the Dalai Lama, along with his chief tutor, Living Buddha Lingtsang, his deputy tutor, Living Buddha Trijang, as well as Kalon Sokhang Wangchen Gelek, and Maji Keimo Sonam Wangdu and other accompanying personnel, arrived at the Nathu La Pass on the southern slope of the Himalayas.

Nathu La Pass is a branch of the southern slope of the Himalayas. It is covered in snow, with low-hanging clouds and fog, barren and frigid. The ancient trade route between China and India that crosses the Himalayas passes through here.

Welcoming the Dalai Lama at the Nathu La Pass were Major General Jin Shaoshan, representative of the CCP Tibet Work Committee and the Tibet Military Region, Hui Yiran, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CCP Tibet Work Committee, and Ramba Langji Wangdui, representative of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Also welcoming the Dalai Lama here were representatives of various offices, organizations, and stationed troops from Yadong and Phari, as well as many monks and laypeople.

Accompanying the Dalai Lama to the Nathu La Pass were Ye Chengzhang, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in India, Pant, the Political Officer of India in Sikkim, the Prince of Sikkim, and some Sikkim Buddhists.

Major General Jin Shaoshan was the first to greet the Dalai Lama and delivered a welcoming speech, saying: The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama's visit to India has done much useful work in enhancing Sino-Indian friendship, strengthening cultural exchange between the two countries, and safeguarding world peace. Today, they have completed their trip and returned to the country. I am here to welcome them on behalf of the CCP Tibet Work Committee and the Tibet Military Region.

Major General Jin Shaoshan presented a Hada to the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama nodded and smiled at Major General Jin Shaoshan, saying: "Very good, thank you for coming such a long way to welcome us."

The welcoming crowd presented Hadas to the Dalai Lama in turn. The Dalai Lama blessed the Tibetans one by one by touching their heads. Afterwards, the Dalai Lama and his party rode horses down the mountain to Kagyu Monastery, which is more than twenty kilometers from the Nathu La Pass, to rest.

At Kagyu Monastery, the Dalai Lama was welcomed by representatives of the Tibetan local government, Daza Zasa, representatives of the three major monasteries of Lhasa, and all the lamas of the monastery.

Lakshman Singh, the acting Trade Agent of India in Yadong, also went to Kagyu Monastery to welcome him.

Kagyu Monastery is a monastery of the White Sect, surrounded by pine forests and beautiful scenery. The Dalai Lama and his party stayed here that night.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 16th: People from all ethnic groups and walks of life in towns and cities along the highway from Yadong to Lhasa are preparing to welcome the Dalai Lama.

Representatives from the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the CCP Tibet Work Committee, the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Tibetan local government, and the three major monasteries of Lhasa, and other organizations, who are going to the border to welcome the Dalai Lama, have arrived in Yadong one after another. They will wait at Nathu La and other places south of Yadong to welcome the Dalai Lama.

    据新华社亚东16日电　达赖喇嘛结束了他在印度和锡金的访问之后，15日从锡金的春谷地方沿喜马拉雅山北上回到了中国西藏境内。

    乃堆拉山是喜马拉雅山南麓的一条支脉。积雪皑皑，云雾低迷，荒芜而高寒，中印之间穿越喜马拉雅山的古商道从这里经过。

    金绍山少将把哈达献给达赖喇嘛。达赖喇嘛不住点头微笑着向金绍山少将说：“很好，谢谢你们远道前来欢迎。”
    欢迎的人群依次向达赖喇嘛敬献哈达。达赖喇嘛一一为藏族人摸顶祝福。随后，达赖喇嘛一行骑马下山，前往离乃堆拉山口二十多公里的噶举寺休息。
    在噶举寺，达赖喇嘛受到了西藏地方政府代表大扎扎萨和拉萨三大寺代表以及全寺喇嘛们的欢迎。
