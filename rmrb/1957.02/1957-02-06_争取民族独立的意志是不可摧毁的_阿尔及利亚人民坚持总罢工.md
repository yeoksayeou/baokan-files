    The Will to Fight for National Independence Is Indestructible
    Algerian People Persist in General Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 5th: The Algerian people intensified their struggle on the 4th to greet the eighth day of the general strike.
    In the city of Algiers, French military police entered Arab residential areas before dawn to search for workers, using military trucks to escort them to their workplaces. However, the number of Algerians participating in the strike still reached 250,000, accounting for nine-tenths of the Algerian population of the city. The French military commander of the city, Mathieu, ordered seals to be affixed to the doors of shops refusing to open, stating "No opening without orders," but many shops remained closed. Even the courts had to postpone trials because Algerian judges refused to attend.
    In other major cities, such as Bône, Constantine, Blida, Tlemcen, and Sidi Bel Abbès, more than 50% or even all Algerians persisted in the strike.
    According to reports from Paris, 85% of North African workers in Paris and its suburbs did not go to work, and North African workers in other provinces of France also held strikes.
    The five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, who were kidnapped by the French authorities last October and imprisoned in the Fresnes Prison in Paris, have announced a hunger strike in support of the Algerian general strike.

    争取民族独立的意志是不可摧毁的
    阿尔及利亚人民坚持总罢工
    据新华社5日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚人民4日以加紧斗争来迎接总罢工的第八天。
    在阿尔及尔市，法国军警在天亮以前就开入阿拉伯居民区搜捕工人，用军用卡车把他们押解到工作地点去。但是参加罢工的阿尔及利亚人仍然达到二十五万人，占全市阿尔及利亚人的十分之九。法军城防司令马休下令在拒绝营业的店铺门上贴上“未获命令不得开业”的封条，但许多商店继续关门。甚至法庭也因为阿尔及利亚籍法官拒绝出席而不得不延期审讯案件。
    在其他大城市，如波那、君士坦丁、布利达·特利姆森和西迪·倍尔·阿卑斯，有50％以上甚至全体阿尔及利亚人坚持罢工。
    据巴黎消息，在巴黎和巴黎近郊有85％的北非工人没有上工，在法国其他各省，北非工人也举行了罢工。
    去年10月被法国当局绑架并且被监禁在巴黎费雷纳监狱的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的五个领袖，已经宣布绝食，支持阿尔及利亚的总罢工。
