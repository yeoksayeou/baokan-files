Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th. Shandong Province plans to expand its irrigated area by ten million mu this year, of which about six million mu will be completed by repairing and improving existing water conservancy projects. This plan was determined by the Provincial People's Committee after in-depth investigation and research by the Provincial Department of Water Conservancy.

According to the plan, Shandong Province will repair 700,000 existing old wells, shallow wells, and semi-finished wells this year. By making full use of existing water conservancy equipment and tapping the potential of water sources, the irrigated area will be expanded by about six million mu. At the same time, according to the specific conditions of agricultural cooperatives in various places, 150,000 new wells will be drilled, and some reservoirs, ponds, and other irrigation projects will be constructed.

After last year's autumn harvest, water conservancy departments at all levels in Shandong Province had two different views on the focus of this year's water conservancy construction. One view was that more than 70% of the province's cultivated land is still dry land, and changing dry land into paddy fields is one of the important measures for increasing agricultural production, so new water conservancy projects should be vigorously constructed. The other view was that last year, due to overestimating the objective favorable conditions, the pace of water conservancy construction was too fast, resulting in many waste products and substandard products. This year, the focus should be on reinforcing existing water conservancy projects. In order to correctly solve this problem, in addition to requiring water conservancy departments at all levels to earnestly conduct investigations and research and propose local water conservancy tasks based on facts, the Provincial Department of Water Conservancy also dispatched two groups of cadres, starting in August last year, to 65 agricultural cooperatives in different regions to conduct investigations on manpower, materials, and funds. After four months of investigation, the Provincial Department of Water Conservancy believes that more than 70% of the water conservancy projects built last year were successful, and nearly 30% were semi-finished and waste products. As long as the semi-finished wells are repaired and land leveling and ridging are done well, each well can irrigate about ten more mu of land. This does not cost much money and labor. If we were to demand drilling as many new wells this year as last year, although there are many favorable conditions, the material and financial resources of the agricultural cooperatives are far from sufficient, and in some areas, the number of wells has reached saturation, so there is no need to drill new wells. After repeated research and discussion, it was finally determined that this year's farmland water conservancy construction should focus on consolidating and improving existing water conservancy projects.

### 着重整修原有水利工程  山东今年将扩大灌溉面积一千万亩

    着重整修原有水利工程
    山东今年将扩大灌溉面积一千万亩
    新华社济南11日电　山东省今年计划扩大灌溉面积一千万亩，其中有六百万亩左右，将依靠整理和改善已有水利工程来完成。这个计划是在省水利厅深入调查研究以后，由省人民委员会确定的。
    根据计划，今年山东省将整修现有的旧井、浅井、半成品井七十万眼。通过充分利用原有水利设备，发挥水源潜力，来扩大水浇地六百万亩左右。同时，根据各地农业社的具体条件，将增打新井十五万眼，以及兴修一些水库、塘坝等灌溉工程。
    去年秋收以后，山东省各级水利部门对今年水利建设的重点有两种不同的看法。一种看法是，全省耕地还有70％以上是旱地，变旱地为水田是农业增产的重要措施之一，应该大力建设新的水利工程；另一种看法是，去年由于过高估计了客观上的有利条件，在兴修水利中步子放得太大，造成不少废品和次品，今年应当以加固已有水利工程为主。为了正确解决这一问题，省水利厅除要求各级水利部门认真从事调查研究，实事求是地提出当地兴修水利的任务外，并且从去年8月份开始，先后派出两批干部，分别到不同地区的六十五个农业社，作了人力、物力和资金等方面的调查。经过四个月的调查摸底，省水利厅认为，去年兴建的水利工程70％以上是成功的，近30％是半成品和废品。半成品井只要整修好，同时作好平地整畦工作，每眼就可以大约多浇十亩地。这样做，花费的资金和劳动力并不多。今年如果再要求打去年那样多的新井，虽然具有许多有利条件，但是农业社的物力和财力是远远达不到的，而且有些地区井的数量已经达到饱和状态，不需要再打新井了。经过多次研究、讨论以后，最后确定今年的农田水利建设以巩固提高已有的水利工程为主。
