Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The People's Liberation Army (PLA) units are taking various measures to regularize the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people.

Many units have made specific plans for further strengthening military-government and military-civilian relations in the future. The leading organs of the Wuhan garrison stipulated that comrades participating in the local Party committees should actively participate in the local Party committee meetings and proactively report on the work of the army to the Party committee. Representatives of the troops to the People's Congress should earnestly fulfill their responsibilities as representatives and play a role in strengthening military-government and military-civilian relations. According to regional divisions, all units should proactively establish contact with local Party and government organs, and hold at least two Party-government-military-civilian symposiums each year, and exchange opinions through activities such as visits, inspections, and checks on mass discipline, and promptly deal with relevant issues. The Air Defense Force in the Beijing area also proposed a method at a recent political work conference to allow local Party organizations to supervise the implementation of policies and laws by decentralized duty units. Many agencies and units stationed in Beijing, such as the Public Security Forces, the Air Force, and the Navy, have designated dedicated personnel to contact local Party and government agencies regularly and actively educate and organize the vast numbers of officers, enlisted personnel, salaried employees, and family members to participate in various social activities. Some units have also stipulated that officers and family members living in street dormitories should also participate in street resident organizations and be subject to the management of public security police stations and street resident committees. Many units are preparing to invite responsible persons from local Party and government agencies to give reports to the troops on policy laws and other issues on an irregular basis.

In order to strengthen military-civilian ties, all units on the Fujian front have established village-based work groups. Some units’ officers and soldiers have also formulated "Pacts to Support the Government and Cherish the People," and automatically help landlords clean, carry water, and repair houses. A certain army unit stationed in Hebei Province recently sent thirty officers to assist agricultural production cooperatives in rectification work.

In addition, the garrisons in various places have conscientiously handled the criticisms and suggestions raised by the people in various places during the symposiums and visits during the Spring Festival. The Fuzhou area garrison held a motor vehicle safety driving conference and put forward many measures to ensure driving safety. A certain naval port garrison adjusted the setting of fortifications to facilitate fishermen's fishing at sea. The garrisons in various places have conscientiously and responsibly handled the events in which a few officers and soldiers damaged the interests of the masses in the past.

    解放军拥政爱民活动将经常化
    新华社17日讯　中国人民解放军各部队正在采取各种措施使拥政爱民工作经常化。
    许多部队对今后进一步密切军政关系和军民关系，作出了具体规划。武汉驻军领导机关规定：参加当地党委的同志要积极参加地方党委会议，主动向党委汇报军队工作情况。部队的人民代表大会代表要切实履行代表职责，起到密切军政、军民关系的作用。按照地区划分，各部队要同当地党政机关主动建立联系，并且每年至少要举行两次党政军民座谈会，并通过参观、访问、检查群众纪律等活动，交换意见，及时处理有关问题。北京地区防空军在最近召开的政治工作会议上，也提出了请地方党组织监督分散执勤部队执行政策法令的办法。公安军、空军和海军等许多驻北京的机关、部队，都指定了专人定期和地方党、政机关联系，并且积极教育和组织广大官兵、工薪制职员和家属参加各种社会活动。有些单位并且规定住在街道宿舍的军官和家属，也要参加街道居民组织，服从公安派出所和街道居民委员会的管理。许多单位准备不定期的邀请地方党、政机关负责人向部队作关于政策法令等问题的报告。
    为了加强军民联系，福建前线各部队都成立了驻村工作组，有些部队的官兵还订立了“拥政爱民公约”，并且自动帮助房东打扫、挑水和修补房屋。河北省驻军某部最近派出三十名军官，帮助农业生产合作社进行整社工作。
    此外，各地驻军还认真处理了春节期间各地人民在座谈、访问中提出的批评和建议。福州地区驻军召开了汽车安全行车大会，提出了许多保证行车安全的办法。某海港驻军为便利渔民出海捕鱼，调整了工事设置。对于过去少数官兵损害群众利益的事件，各地驻军都作了认真负责的处理。
