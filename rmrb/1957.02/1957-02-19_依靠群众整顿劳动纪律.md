Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 18th: At a meeting convened on the 15th, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China heard from staff of the Second Steelmaking Plant Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel Company (An'gang) who introduced their successful experience in mobilizing the masses for self-education in the rectification of labor discipline.

The Second Steelmaking Plant of An'gang only started production last year. 30% of all employees were farmers who had just entered the factory, and another 20% were students and demobilized soldiers who had arrived not long ago. They had different habits and styles, and some people had very lax labor discipline. Last year, many people were absent from work. Some workers felt that earning enough money to spend after working for ten or twenty days a month was enough, and they would not go to work at other times. In addition, violations of operating procedures and fighting and scolding were also common. In response to this situation, leading cadres had conducted criticism and education, but the results were not significant. Some leaders, fearing criticism for bureaucratism, adopted a laissez-faire attitude.

In order to make employees consciously abide by labor discipline, the Party organization of the Second Steelmaking Plant, after conducting detailed investigation and research in January, decided to adopt the working method of the mass line, mobilize employees for self-education, and change the lax state of labor discipline. The Party organization mobilized the forces of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, first educating cadres above the level of group leader to set an example in observing labor discipline, and then organizing them to separately publicize the importance of observing discipline to all employees, explaining operating procedures to new workers, and organizing employees into groups for discussion. A mass self-education movement was immediately launched. People who had long attendance records and observed discipline were praised by everyone; employees who had not observed discipline in the past also made self-criticisms. Worker Wang Wenyu, who liked to gamble, made a very sincere self-criticism, and the masses forgave him; those who did not make a deep self-criticism were sharply criticized by the masses. Worker Zhang Quanren was often absent from work and refused to be reformed after repeated education. Everyone was very indignant, and the administration took appropriate action based on the "Labor Regulations." These vivid people and events enlightened the masses.

This mass self-education, which lasted only ten days, was very effective. The number of people absent from work, late, or leaving early suddenly decreased by more than two-thirds; anyone who was late or left early was immediately reminded by others. Everyone also paid attention to observing operating procedures.

Cadres at all levels were also educated in the movement and realized the benefits of the mass line working method. In the past, many leaders who were afraid of being criticized for bureaucratism and dared not rectify labor discipline also changed this erroneous idea.

    依靠群众整顿劳动纪律
    新华社鞍山18日电　中共鞍山市委在15日召开的一个会议上，中共鞍钢第二炼钢厂委员会的工作人员介绍了在整顿劳动纪律中发动群众自我教育的成功经验。
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂去年才开工生产，全体职工中有30％是刚进厂的农民，还有20％是才来不久的学生和转业军人，他们有不同的习惯和作风，有些人劳动纪律很涣散，去年有很多人旷过工。有的工人觉得每月干十天或二十天，挣的钱就够花了，其他时间便不上班。此外，违反操作规程，打架骂人的行为也很普遍。对这种情况，领导干部曾经进行过批评教育，但是收到的效果不大，部分领导人员怕被批评官僚主义，就采取了自由主义的态度。
    为使职工自觉地遵守劳动纪律，第二炼钢厂党组织在1月份进行细致的调查研究以后，决定采用群众路线的工作方法，发动职工自我教育，改变劳动纪律松弛的状况。党组织调动了党、行政、工会、青年团的力量、首先教育组长以上干部作遵守劳动纪律的表率，然后又组织他们分头向全体职工宣传遵守纪律的重要性，向新工人讲解操作规程，组织职工分组讨论。一个群众性的自我教育运动当即掀起来了。长期出勤、遵守纪律的人物，受到大家的表扬；过去不遵守纪律的职工也作了检讨。好赌钱的工人王文郁检讨的很诚恳，群众原谅了他；未深刻检讨的人，遭到群众的尖锐批评。工人张全仁经常旷工屡教不改，大家都很激愤，行政方面就根据“劳动规则”进行了适当的处理。这些活生生的人和事启发了群众觉悟。
    这次群众性的自我教育，前后不过十天，收效却很明显，旷工和迟到早退的人数骤然减少三分之二以上；谁要迟到早退，马上就受到别人的提醒。遵守操作规程，也引起了大家的注意。
    各级干部也在运动中受到了教育，体会到群众路线工作方法的好处。过去许多怕被批评为官僚主义不敢整顿劳动纪律的领导者，也改变了这种错误想法。
