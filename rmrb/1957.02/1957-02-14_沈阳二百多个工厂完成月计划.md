Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 12th. Workers in two hundred and six state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Shenyang City victoriously completed their January production plans during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. The total output value of state-owned industries averaged 120.8% of the planned target. The total output value of local industries increased by 51.7% compared to the same period last year, and the commodity output value also exceeded the planned target. In January, of the thirty-two major products of state-owned factories included in the national plan, twenty-six were completed or over-completed, including twenty-four-row seeders for agricultural production, rock drills, air compressors, and water pumps needed by the mining industry and water conservancy departments, various types of transformers and oil circuit breakers for newly built and renovated factories, mines, and power stations, as well as cotton cloth and other necessities for people's lives.

During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign in January, workers in many factories and enterprises came up with many ways to solve the difficulties of insufficient raw materials. Engineers and technicians at the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory rationally changed the product design, reducing the blank of parts and machining allowance, so that the steel originally needed to manufacture six air compressors can now be used to make seven. For materials that are difficult to source, many factories can try to find substitutes as much as possible. The enameled wire urgently needed by the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory failed to arrive on schedule, and there was none in the warehouse. The material dispatcher immediately took out the enameled wire that had been deemed unqualified in the past and asked experienced coil winding workers to repeatedly test it. It proved to be usable, so the production department did not stop production. Technicians at the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory closely cooperated with veteran skilled workers to replace the expensive and difficult-to-buy potassium permanganate with oxygen. This not only overcame the difficulty of insufficient material supply but also saved more than 600,000 yuan in material costs throughout the year.

    沈阳二百多个工厂完成月计划
    新华社沈阳12日电　沈阳市二百零六个国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂的职工，在增产节约运动中胜利完成了1月份的生产计划。国营工业的总产值平均完成计划120.8％；地方工业的总产值，比去年同时期增长了51.7％，商品产值也超额完成了计划。1月份国营工厂列入国家计划的三十二种主要产品，有二十六种完成或超额完成了计划，在这些产品中有供给农业生产用的二十四行播种机，有采矿工业和水利部门需要的凿岩机、空气压缩机和水泵，有供给新建和改建的工厂矿山和发电站用的各种类型的变压器、油断路器，还有人民生活需要的棉布等。
    在1月份的增产节约运动中，许多工厂企业的职工想出许多办法来解决原材料不足的困难。沈阳空气压缩机厂工程技术人员合理地改变了产品设计，减少部件毛坯和加工余量，这样，原来制造六台空气压缩机所需要的钢铁，现在可以做出七台。对来源困难的材料，许多厂都能尽量想办法采用代用品。沈阳高压开关厂所急需的漆包线未能按期进厂，库里又没有，材料调度员立刻把过去认为不合格的漆包线拿出，请有经验的卷线工人反复试验，证明可以用，使生产部门没有停产。东北制药总厂技术人员同老技术工人密切合作，以氧气代替难以买到的价格很贵的高锰酸钾，不仅克服了材料供应不足的困难，全年还可以节约材料费六十多万元。
