Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th - Recently, the Shanghai Textile Machinery Factory has been circulating model examples of several veteran workers saving steel. Veteran workers Gu Xiangbao, Li A'gen, Ni Jinquan, and Gu Xiaodu from the free forging section of the forging workshop, along with other workers in the section, have processed approximately 30,000 parts from scrap steel from January of last year to the present, saving 39 tons of high-quality steel. At the same time, they have rarely requisitioned new tools since liberation. Many of the hammers, pliers, chisels, molds, etc., used in daily production are made from scrap materials.

Veteran workers like Gu Xiangbao not only frequently search for usable steel from the factory's scrap iron piles, but also often pick up usable scrap steel from roads or garbage dumps. When using scrap materials for processing, they not only rely on their rich experience to identify the properties of the materials, but also sometimes ask the technical inspection section for technical analysis to ensure the quality of the products. Scrap materials are often of different sizes and irregular shapes. In order to "make the best use of everything" and "utilize rationally," they hold "Zhuge Liang" meetings during lunch breaks, with three or five people discussing solutions together, cleverly turning various scrap steels into usable new parts. Recently, when they used scrap materials to manufacture the new product fixture "switch wrench," they discussed it more than ten times. This fixture made from scrap materials is not only of good quality, but also can greatly shorten the processing time of the workpiece.

    善于使用废料的人
    新华社上海12日电　上海纺织机械厂最近流传着关于几个老工人节约钢材的模范事例。这个厂的锻工车间零锻工段老工人顾祥宝、李阿根、倪金泉、顾小度同工段职工一起，从去年1月到现在已经利用废钢铁加工出了三万只左右的零件，节约了三十九吨优质钢材。同时，他们从解放后到现在很少领用新的工具，日常生产中所使用的鎯头、钳子、凿子、模子等，很多都是使用废料做成的。
    老工人顾祥宝等不但经常从厂里的废铁堆里寻找能利用的钢材，并且还经常从路上或垃圾堆里拣回可用的废钢料。在利用废料加工的时候，他们不仅凭着自己的丰富经验来鉴别材料的性质，有时也请技术检查科作技术分析，以保证产品的质量。废料往往大小不一，外形不齐，为了做到“物尽其材”，“合理利用”，他们就趁中午休息时间开“诸葛亮”会，三、五个人一起商量办法，巧妙地把各种废钢材做成了可用的新零件。最近他们利用废料制造新产品夹具“开关扳手”的时候，就经过十多次商量。这个利用废料作出的夹具，不但质量好，而且还可以大大缩短工作物的加工时间。
