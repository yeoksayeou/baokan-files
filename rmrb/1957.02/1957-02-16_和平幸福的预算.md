    Budget of Peace and Happiness
    Jun Qiang
    On February 9, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted the 1957 Soviet National Budget Law. This year's Soviet national budget is based on the tasks set by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolutions of the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee last year. Like the budgets of past years, it still uses a large amount of funds to ensure the further high tide of socialist economy and the further improvement of people's living standards.
    This year's Soviet national budget is a budget that guarantees a further high tide of the national economy on the basis of the comprehensive development of industry and agriculture last year. This year's fiscal revenue of the Soviet Union has greatly increased compared with last year, which shows that the accumulation of socialist economy has a greater growth, and the financial strength of the Soviet government is becoming more and more abundant year by year. In addition, the priority development of heavy industry, the vigorous improvement of people's welfare, the increase of the budgets of various republics, and the further reduction of defense expenditures are all remarkable features of this year's budget.
    On the basis of expanding material production and improving labor productivity, the national income of the Soviet Union this year will increase by 8% compared with last year. The increase of national income is a guarantee for the continued growth of the Soviet Union's financial strength. In the new 1957 budget, the total income is 617,155,967,000 rubles, and the expenditure is 604,580,653,000 rubles. The budget revenue increased by about 34 billion rubles and the expenditure increased by more than 43.5 billion compared with last year.
    As in the past, the national economic appropriation accounts for the largest amount of the Soviet Union's national budget expenditure this year, amounting to more than 244.658 billion rubles. According to the 1957 national economic plan, the total industrial production will increase by 7.1% compared with last year. Among them, the production of means of production increased by 7.8%, and the production of consumer goods increased by 5.9%. Giving priority to the development of heavy industry, improving agriculture and developing the daily-use goods industry on the basis of the development of heavy industry is the firm and unshakable policy of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union to develop the national economy. In line with the national economic plan, this year's appropriations for the development of fuel, metallurgy, power, forestry and other industrial sectors are the largest. In addition, the budget also allocates a lot of funds to light industry and the food industry. Because according to the national economic plan, on the basis of the achievements already made in agriculture last year, this year we will further increase the production of sugar, dairy products, meat and other foods, as well as textiles. This year's appropriation for agriculture has also increased, amounting to 52.9 billion rubles. These funds will promote the further development of agriculture on the basis of last year's bumper harvest.
    The distribution of the Soviet national budget expenditure vividly reflects the concern of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union for further improving the people's welfare. Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet government has taken a series of major measures to improve the people's welfare. For example, increasing the wages of low-wage workers, increasing preferential treatment, extending women's maternity leave, abolishing tuition fees for universities and secondary schools, and increasing the purchase prices of some agricultural products. From this year's budget, it can be seen that the Soviet Union is continuing to implement this policy of vigorously improving the people's welfare. This year's total social and cultural appropriations for the development of education, health care, science, and the training of experts are more than 188.39 billion rubles, an increase of 24.7 billion over last year. Among them, social insurance and social security expenses will increase by one-third compared with last year!
    Improving living conditions is a problem that the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union have always been concerned about, because it is of great significance for improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people. The speed of Soviet housing construction is amazing. For example, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the urban housing area expanded by an average of about 30 million square meters per year. This is roughly equivalent to building a city the size of Moscow in 1940 every year (at that time, Moscow's residential area was only 28 million square meters). Despite this, housing is still in short supply. Therefore, the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee last year regarded this issue as an extremely urgent task. This year's national budget allocates about 29.9 billion rubles for housing construction, an increase of 4.9 billion rubles over last year. In addition, the state will also issue 1.8 billion rubles of loans for private housing construction by employees. With this large amount of funds, it is planned to build 46 million square meters of housing this year, which will be 28% more than last year. In this way, the living conditions of the Soviet people will be further improved this year.
    From the revenue part of this year's Soviet national budget, it can also be seen that the Soviet government strives to make the people's lives more prosperous. For example, the total amount of residents' taxes in the budget revenue decreased by 1.5 billion rubles compared with last year, and its proportion in the budget decreased from 8.7% last year to 8.4%. Because from January 1, 1957, the minimum limit for taxable wages has been increased, and a large number of employees will no longer pay taxes. The total amount of principal and interest paid on national bonds this year is also 1.5 billion rubles more than last year, and at the same time, fewer public bonds will be issued this year than last year by a quarter. In this way, the Soviet people will have more money in their hands this year. Coupled with the development of industry and agriculture this year, especially the increase in the production of consumer goods, the working people will eat better, dress better, and their cultural life will be richer.
    In this year's new Soviet budget, the total budget of the republics reached more than 194.04 billion rubles, an increase of more than 11% over 1956, which is equal to twice that of 1950. This was formulated in accordance with the resolution of the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee last year, with the aim of further expanding the role of the republics in managing the national economy of the republics and eliminating the excessive centralization of economic leadership. This measure formulated in accordance with the Leninist national policy will surely accelerate the prosperity of the economies of the republics.
    Another noteworthy feature of this year's Soviet national budget is the further reduction of defense expenditures. This year's Soviet defense expenditure is 96.7 billion rubles, accounting for 16% of the total budget, while it accounted for 18% last year. This is the result of the Soviet Union's resolute implementation of a peaceful policy and the implementation of a unilateral reduction of 1.8 million troops. This shows that the Soviet Union is concerned about the tendency of international tension to ease not only in words, but also in actual actions. Here, one cannot help but recall the 1957-1958 fiscal year budget recently announced by the United States. In this budget, military appropriations increased to 45.3 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 63% of the U.S. national budget expenditure. At the same time, of the 2.9 billion U.S. dollars increase in the entire U.S. national budget compared with the current fiscal year, 2.6 billion is direct military expenditure and foreign "aid" expenditure aimed at aggression. The appropriations for non-military parts increased by only 0.4% compared with the current fiscal year. Eisenhower said bluntly in his proposed budget message: "A large part of the budget funds must be used to maintain the current high state of readiness of the national army and adopt new weapons." This new U.S. budget stipulates an increase in the number of air force personnel, and continues to expand the "nuclear air deterrence force." It will equip the army with a series of weapons such as newer types of aircraft carrying nuclear bombs, atomic-powered aircraft carriers, submarines, and missile launchers. In addition, it is also necessary to establish a so-called "atomic support command," that is, a task force equipped with nuclear missiles. This budget, which is full of atomic weapons and nuclear weapons, clearly shows the arms expansion and war preparation policy implemented by the United States to intensify international tensions.
    The 1957 national budget of the Soviet Union is a budget of peace and happiness. It will financially guarantee the smooth completion of the Soviet Union's national economic plan this year and guarantee the further improvement of the lives of the Soviet working people.

    和平幸福的预算
    君强
    2月9日，苏联最高苏维埃会议通过了1957年苏联国家预算法。苏联今年的国家预算是根据苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所规定的任务和苏共中央去年12月全会的决议编制的。它同过去每年的预算一样，仍然是把大量资金用来保证社会主义经济的进一步高涨，和人民的生活水平的进一步提高。
    苏联今年的国家预算，是保证国民经济在去年工农业全面发展的基础上进一步高涨的预算。苏联今年的财政收入比去年有很大增加，这表明社会主义经济积累有更大的增长，苏联政府的财政力量一年年更加雄厚。此外，优先发展重工业，大力提高人民福利，增加各加盟共和国的预算，进一步削减国防费用，也都是今年预算中引人注目的特点。
    在扩大物质生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，今年苏联的国民收入将比去年增加8％。国民收入的增加，是苏联财政力量继续增长的保证。新的1957年的预算总额中，收入是六千一百七十一亿五千五百九十六万七千卢布，支出是六千零四十五亿八千零六十五万三千卢布。比去年的预算收入增加约三百四十亿卢布，支出增加约四百三十五亿以上。
    苏联今年的国家预算支出同过去一样，国民经济拨款的数量最大，为二千四百四十六亿五千八百多万卢布。根据1957年的国民经济计划，工业总生产量要比去年增加7.1％。其中生产资料的生产增加7.8％，消费资料的生产增加5.9％。优先发展重工业，在重工业发展的基础上提高农业和发展日用品工业，是苏联共产党和政府发展国民经济的坚定不移的政策。与国民经济计划相适应，今年用于发展燃料、冶金、动力、林业等工业部门的拨款最多。此外，预算中对轻工业和食品工业拨出的资金也很多。因为根据国民经济计划，要在去年农业已经获得成就的基础上，今年进一步增加糖、乳制品、肉类和其他食品以及纺织品的生产。对农业的拨款今年也有增加，计达五百二十九亿卢布。这些资金将促使农业在去年大丰收的基础上得到进一步的发展。
    苏联国家预算支出的分配情况，鲜明地反映出苏联共产党和政府对进一步提高人民福利的关怀。自从苏共第二十次代表大会以后，苏联政府就已采取了一系列重大措施来提高人民的福利。例如，提高低工资职工的工资、提高优抚金额、延长妇女的产假、取消大中学的学费、提高一些农产品的采购价格等。从今年的预算中，可以看出苏联在继续贯彻这个大力提高人民福利的政策。今年用来发展教育、保健、科学、培养专家等事业方面的社会文化拨款总额为一千八百八十三亿九千多万卢布，比去年增加了二百四十七亿。其中社会保险和社会赡养经费将比去年增加三分之一！
    改善居住条件问题是苏联共产党和政府一向关心的问题，因为这对于提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平具有重大的意义。苏联住宅建筑的速度是惊人的。例如，在第五个五年计划期间，城市住宅面积平均每年扩建约三千万平方公尺。这大约等于每年建筑一座像1940年的莫斯科那样大的城市（那时候莫斯科的住宅面积也不过二千八百万平方公尺）。仅管如此，现在住宅仍是供不应求。所以去年12月苏共中央全会把这个问题当作一项极迫切的任务提了出来。今年国家预算对住宅建筑的拨款约达二百九十九亿卢布，即比去年增加四十九亿卢布。此外，国家还要发放十八亿卢布的职工私人住宅建筑贷款。用这一大批款项，计划今年要建筑四千六百万平方公尺住宅，这将比去年增加28％。这样，苏联人民今年的居住条件将得到进一步的改善。
    从苏联今年的国家预算的收入部分来看，也可以看出苏联政府力求人民的生活过得更富裕。例如，预算收入中居民纳税总额比去年减少了十五亿卢布，它在预算中所占比例从去年的8.7％减到8.4％。因为从1957年1月1日起，缴税的工资的最低限度提高了，大量职工将不再纳税。国家公债今年还本付息的总额也比去年多十五亿卢布，同时今年公债要比去年少发行四分之一。这样，苏联人民今年手中的钱会更多了。加上今年工农业的发展，特别是消费品生产的增加，劳动人民会吃得更好，穿得更好，文化生活也会更加丰富了。
    在苏联今年的新预算中，加盟共和国的预算总额达一千九百四十亿四千多万卢布，这比1956年增加了11％强，等于1950年的两倍。这是根据苏共中央去年12月全会的决议拟订的，目的是进一步扩大加盟共和国在管理共和国国民经济中的作用，消除经济领导方面过度集中的情况。这一根据列宁主义的民族政策制定的措施，必将加速促进各加盟共和国经济的繁荣。
    今年苏联国家预算中的另一个引人注目的地方，是国防费用的再一度的减低。今年苏联的国防费用为九百六十七亿卢布，在全部预算中占16％，而去年是占18％。这是苏联坚决执行和平政策，实行单独裁减了一百八十万军队的结果。这说明苏联不是在口头上，而是实际行动上关心国际紧张局势的趋向缓和。这里不能不使人想起美国不久前公布的1957—1958年财政年度的预算。在这个预算中，军事拨款增加到四百五十三亿美元，占美国全国预算开支的63％。同时，美国全部国家预算比本财政年度增加的二十九亿美元中，二十六亿都是直接军费和目的在于侵略的对外“援助”经费。而非军事部分的拨款，仅比本财政年度增加了0.4％，艾森豪威尔曾在他提出的预算咨文中直截了当地说：“预算的一大部分经费必须用来作保持国家军队目前的高度准备状态和采用新武器。”美国这个新预算规定增加空军人数，继续扩充“核子空中威慑力量”，要以更新式的载运核子炸弹的飞机，原子推进的航空母舰、潜水艇和导弹发射舰只等一系列武器来装备军队。此外还要建立所谓“原子支援司令部”，即装备有核子导弹的特遣部队。这个充满了原子武器和核子武器味道的预算，十分清楚地说明了美国所执行的加剧国际紧张局势的扩军备战政策。
    苏联1957年的国家预算，是和平和幸福的预算，它将在财政上保证苏联今年的国民经济计划的顺利完成，保证苏联劳动人民生活的进一步提高。
