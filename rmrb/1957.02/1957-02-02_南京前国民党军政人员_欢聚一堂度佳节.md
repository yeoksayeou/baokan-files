Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, February 1st - Former Kuomintang military and government personnel in Nanjing joyfully gathered to celebrate the Spring Festival on the eve of the holiday.

	The get-together began in a bright exhibition room, where people enthusiastically admired the famous paintings hanging on the walls. Of particular interest was the painting given by the master of traditional Chinese painting, Qi Baishi, to Li Wending, the former Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang's Third Column and Commander of the New First Division, and now a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Li Wending described the circumstances under which Elder Baishi painted it for him. Li Chengzhai, an 82-year-old painter, was in high spirits. He collaborated with painters Li Shuzi, Feng Ruofei, and Song Tianmin, and on the spot, they painted a large "New Year Picture" symbolizing national peace and prosperity. Some of the elderly even spontaneously gathered to compose poetry and matching couplets.

	The quyi (Chinese folk art forms) venue of the gathering was also filled with joy. The crosstalk performed by artists Zhang Yongxi and Guan Liming made some of the elderly burst into laughter. Wang Shaotang, a well-known storyteller and representative of the Jiangsu People's Congress, told an episode of "Wu Song Fighting the Tiger." He narrated Wu Song vividly and captivatingly. Some people were playing mahjong. Li Shijun, the former Kuomintang Supervisory Committee member and current Vice Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, said: "When I recall the old friends who used to play mahjong with me, many of them are still in Taiwan. If they were in Nanjing and could play with us again, how happy would that make us!" The snack bar was also bustling with activity, with many returned overseas Chinese, doctors, and professors eating and chatting there.

	The melodious music led people into the dance hall. Chen Heqin, the former Dean of the Teachers College of the Central University, current member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and President of Nanjing Normal College, made a special trip to attend the dance party. When he started dancing, it was hard to believe he was over sixty years old. Liu Cuoyi, the former Major General Group Leader of the Third Inspection Group of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense and current Counselor of the Nanjing Municipal People's Committee Counselor's Office, and his wife danced until the end of the party before leaving. Some people at the gathering said: "This year is more enjoyable than any previous Spring Festival. It can also be said that this is the encouragement brought to us by the victory of the motherland's socialist construction."

    南京前国民党军政人员
    欢聚一堂度佳节
    新华社南京1日电　在南京的前国民党军政人员在春节前一天愉快地联欢度春节。
    联欢活动开始，在一间宽亮的展览室里，人们兴致勃勃地欣赏着四壁挂满了的各家名画，最引人注目的是国画家齐白石送给前国民党第三纵队副司令兼新一师师长、现任政协江苏省委员会委员李文定的画，李文定在一边介绍了白石老人给他作画的情形。八十二岁的国画家李诚斋情趣很高，他和画家李树滋、冯若飞、宋天民合作，当场濡笔画了一大幅象征国泰民安的“岁朝图”。有一些老人还自动集聚起来吟诗联句。
    联欢会的曲艺场中，也是欢乐融融，艺人张永熙和关立明表演的相声，逗得一些老人捧腹大笑。著名的说书老艺人、江苏省人民代表王少堂说了一段“武松打虎”，他把武松讲得有声有色，令人神往。有些人在玩麻将牌的游戏，前国民党监察委员、现任政协南京市委员会副主席李世军说：回忆过去和我一起常打麻将的老朋友们，现在有很多还在台湾，假若他们在南京，再和我们一道儿玩玩，该是多么叫人高兴呢？小吃部里也是熙熙攘攘，许多归国华侨、医生、教授在那里边吃边谈。
    悠扬的乐曲，把人们引进了舞厅，前中央大学师范学院院长、现任全国政协委员、南京师范学院院长陈鹤琴，特地赶来参加舞会，他跳起舞来简直叫人看不出已是六十多岁的人了。前国民党国防部视察第三组少将组长、现任南京市人民委员会参事室参事刘措宜和他的夫人一直跳到舞会结束才离去。在联欢会上有的人说：今年比哪一年度春节都愉快，这也可以说是祖国社会主义建设胜利带给我们的鼓舞。
