    Combining Production and Practice to Develop Mechanics Research
    Mechanics Academic Conference Concludes; Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Established

    Xinhua News Agency, 10th – The National Mechanics Academic Conference concluded today. A total of sixty-five papers were read and discussed at the conference, covering six areas: fluid mechanics, elasticity, plasticity, structural mechanics, automatic control, and general mechanics. Many of the issues discussed in the papers are directly or indirectly related to the development of industrial construction and national defense construction. For example, in fluid mechanics, problems were raised regarding gas dynamics, hydraulics and fluid mechanics of rotating machinery, seepage flow, etc.; in elasticity, calculations related to plates, shells, and thin-walled structures, gravity dams, etc.; in plasticity, problems related to the theory of metal pressure processing; and in engineering cybernetics, problems related to capital construction.

    Many papers explored the basic theoretical problems of certain branches of mechanics. These problems are highly valued by the international mechanics community and have not yet been resolved, such as the theory of turbulence in fluid mechanics, and the theory of stress-strain relationships in the plastic state of metals in plasticity.

    Zhou Peiyuan, Guo Yonghuai and others also made seven comprehensive reports on turbulence problems, high-speed aerodynamics, plasticity, engineering seismology, solid fluidization, etc. These reports talked about the latest developments and problems to be solved in some mechanics departments.

    Qian Weichang said in his concluding report that the fields and aspects of mechanics research currently touched upon are still relatively few. In the future, experienced older scientists should pay attention to combining with the needs of production and practice to develop new fields. He said that mechanics workers should pay more attention to experimental work in the future, improve the supply of books and materials, and effectively cultivate new forces in various ways.

    Xinhua News Agency, 10th – The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics was established in Beijing today. The council of the society consists of thirty-five people, including Qian Xuesen, Zhou Peiyuan, and Qian Weichang.

    At present, the total number of mechanics workers distributed in various universities, scientific research institutions and industrial sectors across the country has reached more than a thousand. The Mechanics Society will unite mechanics workers across the country to organize national or regional academic experience exchanges at home and abroad, publish the "Acta Mechanica Sinica" regularly, exchange books and materials, learn advanced international scientific achievements and promote mechanics research.

    结合生产和实践发展力学研究
    力学学术报告会结束　中国力学学会成立
    新华社10日讯　全国力学学术报告会今天闭幕。会上共宣读和讨论了六十五篇论文，它们涉及到流体力学、弹性力学、塑性力学、结构力学、自动控制以及一般力学等六个方面。好多论文所探讨的问题都是和工业建设和国防建设的发展有直接或间接关系的。例如：流体力学方面提出的关于气体动力学、水力学和转动机械的流体力学、渗流等方面的问题，弹性力学方面提出的关系板壳和薄壁构件、重力坝等的计算，和金属压力加工有关的塑性理论方面的问题以及工程控制论方面的问题等等，都是和基本建设有关的重要问题。
    有不少论文探讨了力学中某些分支的基本理论问题，这些问题都是国际力学界极为重视而一直还没有解决的，如流体力学方面关于湍流的理论，塑性力学方面关于金属塑性状态中应力应变关系的理论等。
    周培源、郭永怀等人还作了关于湍流问题、高速空气动力学、塑性力学、工程地震、固体流态化等七篇综合性报告，这些报告讲到了某些力学部门的最新发展和有待解决的问题。
    钱伟长在总结报告中说，目前力学研究接触的领域和方面还较少，今后，有工作经验的老科学家，应该注意结合生产和实践的需要，发展新的领域。他说，力学工作者今后对实验工作也应加以更多的重视，并且要改善图书资料的供应工作，用多种多样的方法有效地大力培养新生力量。
    据新华社10日讯　中国力学学会今天在北京成立，由钱学森、周培源、钱伟长等三十五人组成学会的理事会。
    目前，分布在全国各高等学校、科学研究机构及产业部门的力学工作者总共已达千人以上。力学学会将团结全国力学工作者组织全国性或地区性的国内外学术经验交流，定期出版力学学报，交换图书资料，学习国际先进科学成就和推动力学研究。
