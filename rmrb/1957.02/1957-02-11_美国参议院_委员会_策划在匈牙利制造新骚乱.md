　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 10th: Certain individuals in the United States are still not giving up the idea of creating new disturbances in Hungary. It is reported that the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, which is connected to American spy agencies, recently held a meeting on this matter. Several Hungarian counter-revolutionaries who fled under the protection of the US authorities spoke at the meeting as so-called "witnesses."

　　One of the "witnesses" was a man named Fernagi, who claimed to be a representative of the "Budapest Workers' Council"; this organization has been dissolved by the Hungarian government for engaging in counter-revolutionary activities. Fernagi called on Western countries to assist the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries. Angered by the failure of the counter-revolutionary riots, he clamored to "destroy everything," to "drag Hungary into chaos," and even clamored to make Hungary "walk the path of complete destruction."

    美国参议院—委员会
    策划在匈牙利制造新骚乱
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿9日讯：美国某些人士仍然不放弃在匈牙利制造新的骚乱的想法。据报道，同美国间谍机关有联系的美国参议院国内安全小组委员会最近为这件事举行了会议，有几个在美国当局保护下逃出的匈牙利反革命分子作为所谓“见证人”在会上讲了话。
    作为“见证人”的有一个名叫弗纳吉，他自称是“布达佩斯工人委员会”的代表；这个组织由于进行反革命活动，已经被匈牙利政府解散。弗纳吉呼吁西方国家援助匈牙利的反革命分子，他因反革命暴乱失败而恼怒，叫嚣着要“毁掉一切”，“把匈牙利拖入混乱”，甚至叫嚣要使匈牙利“走上完全毁灭的道路”。
