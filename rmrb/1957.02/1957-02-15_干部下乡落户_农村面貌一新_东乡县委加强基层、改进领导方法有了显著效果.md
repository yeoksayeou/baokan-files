Cadres Settle in the Countryside, Rural Areas Take on a New Look
Dongxiang County Party Committee Achieves Remarkable Results in Strengthening the Grassroots and Improving Leadership Methods

(Report from this newspaper) Since last autumn, when Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, transferred a large number of cadres to "settle down" in the countryside, a new outlook has begun to emerge in the county's rural work. In the vast rural areas, the connection between the Party and the masses has become increasingly close, democratic life within the Party and the Youth League has become more active, the working abilities of township and commune cadres have continuously improved, and the progress of various tasks has been smoother than before.

More than three months ago, the grassroots leadership in Dongxiang County's rural areas was relatively weak. In rural areas with large areas and heavy workloads, there were only sixteen district-level cadres and sixty-odd general cadres. The county party committee mostly sat on top issuing orders, and various tasks were implemented downwards through working groups, with concrete and detailed organizational work replaced by endless meetings and official documents. This leadership method resulted in the county party committee being disconnected from the grassroots organizations, and many new problems in rural work could not be resolved in a timely manner.

In August and September of last year, the Dongxiang County Party Committee convened a meeting to comprehensively analyze the new situation in the countryside and the new problems that had emerged in township-level organizations. It was decided to first improve the county's leadership methods towards the townships. The county party committee transferred thirteen county committee members to work in the countryside on a permanent basis, and implemented a "zonal responsibility system" to help township and commune cadres improve their leadership and solve practical problems. The county party committee also transferred twenty-nine district-level party member cadres to serve as secretaries of township party general branches. The eighty-two cadres who had originally participated in various working groups were also assigned to fixed positions in each township. After this large number of new forces took root in the countryside, significant changes have taken place in the face of rural work over the past three months.

The large number of cadres going to the countryside has strengthened the ties between the higher and lower levels, strengthened the grassroots leadership, improved the planning of various tasks, and made the work faster, more thorough, and better than before. First of all, after the county party committee members went deep into the countryside, they investigated and studied issues such as "the new situation of agricultural cooperation," "production and distribution," and "the economic situation of each township," and gained a concrete and in-depth understanding of the actual work, making them more knowledgeable when arranging and guiding work. After the party general branches in each township were strengthened, they were able to make appropriate arrangements for the tasks assigned by the county party committee in a timely manner. Due to the timely and practical leadership, the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres was brought into full play. Therefore, despite the drought that occurred in various rural areas throughout the county last year, the winter planting plan of 396,200 mu was still completed. In the year-end distribution work, the county's fifty-eight advanced cooperatives mostly conscientiously implemented the principles of "less deduction and more distribution" and "distribution according to labor," and properly resolved the remaining problems in the summer harvest distribution and the contradictions between "rich" and "poor" villages, resulting in increased income for 80% of the members. The enthusiasm of the members for production was high, and sideline production shifted from dormancy to activity, with the sideline income in the fourth quarter of last year exceeding the total income of the previous three quarters.

After the grassroots leadership was strengthened, various tasks were taken care of, and central work and professional work were properly arranged. Because everyone's responsibilities were clear, cadres were able to settle down, work efficiency improved, and work style also improved. Work that was rarely managed in the townships before, such as the Youth League, organization, propaganda, culture, education, and health work, now has full-time cadres to manage it. In the past, the county would find the branch secretary whenever there was something to do, which made the branch secretary too busy and often neglected one thing for another, delaying the central work. Now, full-time cadres are assigned to various tasks, and the main cadres in each township have reduced their daily affairs, spending more than twenty-six days a month in the fields and in the homes of the members, supervising and inspecting work, and concretely solving problems. Therefore, the party building, Youth League building, civil affairs, preferential treatment, culture, education, health, finance, food, public security, women's work, and handicraft work in various townships in the fourth quarter of last year were all very organized and better than in the past.

The strengthening of the rural grassroots leadership has also changed the phenomenon of the unclear division of powers between the Party, government, and cooperative. The administrative system of agricultural cooperatives has been improved, and the democratic life within the Party has become increasingly active. Each township has established grassroots party committees and general branch committees in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, formulated organizational life systems and study systems, and strengthened the regular education of party members. In the past, when assigning work tasks, each township pushed everything to the agricultural cooperative, and many cooperative directors held multiple positions, unable to concentrate their efforts on leading production. The leadership role of the Party and the role of the administration were also weakened as a result. After the party branch committee was improved, major issues were brought to the committee for collective discussion, and decisions were made, and then the committee members responsible for each area separately supervised the implementation. In this way, the work of the Party, the administration, and the agricultural cooperative was done well at the same time. Since the main cadres of the Yongqin First Branch of Xiling Township concentrated their efforts on leading the production and management work of the cooperative, the cooperative's management and operation work has greatly improved. In winter production, the attendance rate of the entire cooperative increased from 40% to 85%, and production efficiency increased by 151%.

In response to the situation that grassroots cadres have a low level of policy and relatively weak working ability, twenty-four of the county's twenty-seven townships (towns) have established a study system. Grassroots cadres spend two days each month studying work and two days studying policies and business. Some townships have also established classes and groups for studying theory and culture according to the different political and cultural levels of the cadres. After the cadres improved their understanding and learned working methods, they led various tasks with full confidence.

### 干部下乡落户　农村面貌一新  东乡县委加强基层、改进领导方法有了显著效果

    干部下乡落户　农村面貌一新
    东乡县委加强基层、改进领导方法有了显著效果
    本报讯　江西省东乡县去年秋天调动大批干部下乡“安家落户”以后，全县农村工作开始出现新的面貌。在广大农村里，党和群众的联系日益密切，党内团内的民主生活更加活跃，乡、社干部的工作能力不断提高，各项工作的进行比从前顺利。
    三个多月以前，东乡县农村基层领导力量比较薄弱。在面积大、工作任务繁重的农村里，只有十六名区级干部和六十多名一般干部。县委多半坐在上面发号施令，各项工作都通过工作组向下面贯彻，具体细致的组织工作被无休止的会议和公文所代替。这种领导方法就使得县委和基层组织脱节，农村工作中的许多新问题不能及时得到解决。
    去年8、9月间，中共东乡县委召开了会议，全面分析了农村新的形势和乡一级组织出现的新问题，决定首先改进县对乡的领导方法。县委抽调了十三名县委委员常住农村工作，并实行“划片负责制”，帮助乡、社干部改进领导和解决实际工作中的问题。县委又抽调了二十九个区级党员干部担任乡党总支书记。原来参加各种工作组的八十二名干部也在各乡分派了固定的工作。此外，县的各部门还派出一百一十八名有农村工作经验的干部支援农村基层工作。这一大批生力军在农村中扎根以后，三个月来，农村工作的面貌发生了显著的变化。
    大批干部下乡，密切了上下联系，加强了基层领导力量，各项工作的计划性提高，工作比以前做得较快、较透、较好。首先，县委委员深入农村以后，调查研究了如“农业合作化的新情况”、“生产和分配”、“各乡经济情况”等问题，对实际工作有了具体深入的了解，安排和指导工作的时候，心中就更加有数。各乡的党总支加强以后，对县委布置的工作就能及时作出适当的安排。由于有了及时的切合实际的领导，基层干部的工作积极性得到了充分的发挥。因此，去年全县农村各地虽然发生了冬旱，仍然完成了三十九万六千二百亩的冬种计划。全县五十八个高级社在年终分配工作中，大都认真贯彻了“少扣多分”和“按劳取酬”的原则，同时妥善地解决了夏收分配中的遗留问题和“富”“穷”村之间的矛盾问题，使80％的社员都增加了收入。社员的生产情绪高涨，副业生产由沉寂转向活跃，去年第四季度的副业收入比前三个季度收入的总和还多。
    基层领导力量加强以后，各种工作都有人管了，中心工作和业务工作都作了适当安排。由于每人的职责分明，干部安下心来了，工作效率提高，作风也有了改善。原来乡里很少有人管的工作，如青年团、组织、宣传、文教卫生等工作，现在都有专职干部管了。过去县里有事便找支部书记，使支部书记忙得不可开交，往往顾此失彼，耽误了中心工作；现在各方面的工作配备了专职干部，每个乡的主要干部减少了日常事务，每月都有二十六天以上的时间在田间和社员家里，督促检查工作，具体解决问题。因此，各乡去年第四季度的建党、建团、民政优抚、文教卫生、财粮、治安以及妇女工作和手工业工作都很有头绪，比过去做得好。
    农村基层领导力量的加强，也改变了党、政、社职权不分的现象。农业社的行政制度健全了；党内的民主生活日益活跃。各乡根据党章的规定建立了基层党委会和总支委员会，制定了组织生活制度和学习制度，也加强了对党员的经常性的教育。过去各乡在布置工作任务的时候，事事往农业社推，许多社主任身兼数职，不能集中力量领导生产；党的领导作用和行政的作用也因此削弱了。党支部委员会健全以后，重大问题都提到委员会上集体讨论，作出决定，然后由各个负专责的委员分头督促贯彻执行。这样，党、行政和农业社的工作都同时做好了。西岭乡永勤第一分社的主要干部集中力量领导社的生产和管理工作以来，社的经营管理工作大有改进。在冬季生产中，全社出勤率由40％提高到85％，生产效率提高了151％。
    针对基层干部政策水平低、工作能力比较弱的情况，全县二十七个乡（镇）有二十四个乡建立了学习制度。基层干部每个月有两天时间研究工作、两天学习政策和业务。有的乡还根据干部政治、文化水平的不同情况，成立了学习理论和文化的班、组。干部提高认识和学到工作办法以后，都满怀信心地领导各项工作。
