Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd: The week-long military talks between British Defense Minister Sandys and US Defense Secretary Wilson have concluded.

In addition to the two defense ministers, other senior military leaders and civilian officials from both countries participated in the military talks. Sandys also held talks with Eisenhower and Dulles.

The communique issued on the 2nd stated that during the military talks, the two sides "studied the military aspects of the international situation" and "the international aspects of military planning," "reaffirmed the alignment of their defense goals," and believed that "primary attention must be given to maintaining effective military capabilities in a high state of readiness, which must include both nuclear forces and conventional forces."

Regarding the issue of military expenditure burdens, the communique stated that, while implementing arms expansion and war preparations, "appropriate" consideration must be given to "fiscal and economic stability." However, before departing for home on the 2nd, Sandys told reporters at the airport that he "did not consider nor expect to reach an agreement on this issue" during the talks. He also said: "The issue of reducing British defense efforts is a matter to be decided by Britain."

During his negotiations in Washington, Sandys also met with Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent and Canadian military leaders in Ottawa on January 31 to discuss "the possibility of Britain reducing its military commitments on the European continent."

    美英军事会谈结束
    英国防大臣希望减轻英国军事负担
    据新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：英国国防大臣桑迪斯和美国国防部长威尔逊举行的为时一周的军事会谈已经结束。
    参加两国军事会谈的除两国国防部长外，还有两国的其他高级军事首脑和文职官员。桑迪斯还同艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯举行了会谈。
    2日发表的会谈公报说，双方在这次军事会谈中“研究了国际局势的军事方面”和“军事计划的国际方面”，“重申了他们的防务目标的一致”，而且认为“必须首先注意保持处在高度准备状态的有效军事能力，这必须既包括核子力量也包括常规部队”。
    在谈到军费负担的问题时，公报虽然认为，在实行扩军备战的同时，必须“适当”考虑到“财政和经济的稳定”。但是，桑迪斯2日动身回国前在机场对记者说，他在会谈中“没有考虑到也没有期望过在这个问题上取得协议”，他又说：“减少英国防御工作的问题是要由英国决定的问题”。
    桑迪斯在华盛顿谈判期间还于1月31日到渥太华同加拿大总理圣劳伦和加拿大军事首脑举行了会谈，讨论了“英国可能减少它在欧洲大陆上的军事义务的问题”。
