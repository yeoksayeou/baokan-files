Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 21st: Heilongjiang Province, one of China's main timber-producing areas, will increase timber production by one million cubic meters this year. This timber can be used to build more than 7.69 million square meters of cement-mixed structure houses, or made into railway sleepers to lay more than 2,700 kilometers of railway.

The guarantee for achieving this increased production task is mainly to make full use of resources and increase the utilization rate per unit area; to conscientiously carry out rational logging, and to make full use of treetop wood and wood felled during preparatory operations. In addition, preparations are being made to appropriately expand some logging yards in accordance with the state's regulations on timber felling.

These days, the Forestry Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Working Committee of the Yichun Forest Area of the Communist Party of China held meetings of cadres from relevant forest industry departments in Harbin and Yichun respectively, to further study how to ensure the realization of this year's increased production tasks and exchange increased production experiences.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 21st: The six forest industry bureaus of Jilin Province are giving full play to the efficiency of mechanized operations and will harvest 600,000 cubic meters more timber than planned last year, and will also increase the production of commercial timber for the state by 80,000 cubic meters.

After resource surveys in the rich Changbai Mountain forest area, the overall design of the logging area was completed in August last year, creating conditions for large-scale logging operations to begin. In order to meet the state's urgent need for timber, the Jilin Provincial Forest Industry Administration carried out production preparation work such as logging area design, equipment maintenance, road construction, and house building in the third quarter of last year for this year. The proportion of mechanized operations this year is slightly higher than last year, so the province has great potential for increasing timber production this year. The timber planned to be harvested this year will increase by 44% compared to last year's output. The Linjiang and Bajiazi Forest Industry Bureaus will also organize mechanical forces this year to haul more than 400,000 cubic meters of insect-eroded timber and fir timber that was felled on the mountains in the past down the mountains for paper-making by the paper industry and for firewood for urban residents.

    大量增产木材　适应建设需要
    黑龙江吉林将多产木材一百六十万立方公尺
    新华社哈尔滨21日电　我国木材主要产区之一的黑龙江省，今年将可增产木材一百万立方公尺。这些木材能建筑七百六十九万多平方公尺水泥混合结构的房屋；做成枕木，可以铺设两千七百多公里铁路。
    实现这一增产任务的保证，主要是充分利用资源，提高单位面积利用率；认真搞好合理造材，尽量利用梢头木和准备作业中伐掉的木材等。另外，还准备按照国家采伐木材的规定，适当扩大一部分伐木场。
    这几天，中共黑龙江省委林业部、中共伊春林区工作委员会分别在哈尔滨和伊春召开有关森林工业部门的干部会议，进一步研究如何保证实现今年的增产任务和交流增产经验。
    据新华社长春21日电　吉林省六个森林工业局充分发挥机械作业效率，今年将比去年计划多采伐六十万立方公尺木材，还要给国家增产八万立方公尺商品木材。
    富饶的长白山林区经过资源调查以后，到去年8月完成了伐区总设计，有条件开始大规模的采伐工作。吉林省森林工业管理局，为适应国家对木材的紧迫需要，在去年第三季度就为今年进行伐区设计、设备检修、修道路、盖房子等生产准备工作。今年机械化作业比重又比去年稍有提高，因此全省今年增产木材的潜力很大。今年计划采伐的木材，比去年产量提高44％。临江、八家子两个森林工业局，今年还将组织机械力量把过去砍倒在山上的四十多万立方公尺虫蚀材和杉木材拉下山来，作为造纸工业造纸和城市人民烧柴用。
