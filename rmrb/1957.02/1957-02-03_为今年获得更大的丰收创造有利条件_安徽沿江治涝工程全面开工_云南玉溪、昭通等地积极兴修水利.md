Xinhua News Agency:
    To create favorable conditions for an even greater harvest this year, flood control and drainage projects for 192 large embankments along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province have fully commenced, with over 180,000 laborers working daily. They will excavate 652 new ditches, repair 231 old ditches, and construct or repair 6 small reservoirs and 324 culverts and sluice gates. Upon completion of these projects, over 1.04 million mu of embankment farmland will be free from flooding this year.

    The area along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province is a major rice-producing region, with the embankment areas being high-yield areas for rice. Among the more than 2,000 large and small embankments, there are approximately 6 million mu of farmland. These embankment farmlands are close to the river, and some are located in low-lying areas or have inadequate drainage facilities, frequently suffering from flooding. In 1956, 1.32 million mu of embankment farmland suffered reduced yields due to flooding, with 550,000 mu yielding no harvest. In the past few years, the task of repairing dikes along the river was significant, and there was insufficient labor to allocate, so flood control and drainage projects in the embankment areas were not undertaken. This year, with the dike repair task basically completed, the Communist Party organizations in the areas along the river have begun to vigorously lead the peasants in the embankment areas in undertaking flood control and drainage projects.

    This newspaper reports: In order to strive for a greater harvest this year, Yuxi and Zhaotong areas in Yunnan Province are actively constructing water conservancy projects. Since the transition to cooperatives last winter, Yuxi Prefecture has been fully engaged in winter production and spring plowing preparations. They have particularly focused on the crucial aspect of water conservancy, with cadres from the county to the district to the cooperative being specifically responsible. The CCP Jiangchuan County Committee has a deputy county secretary and four county committee members specifically responsible for water conservancy work. The entire prefecture has more than 76,000 people participating in the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects daily, and many counties have made significant achievements. Among them, Kunyang County has constructed and repaired 197 dams and ponds, and newly opened 56 irrigation ditches, with another 41 dams and ponds under construction. The water storage capacity of the county's 398 dams and ponds has reached over 70%. Yimen County has completed more than 230 of the 257 small-scale water conservancy projects planned for construction and repair. Songyuan Township in Chengjiang County is a mountainous area with no rivers or ponds. Currently, cooperative members are braving the cold weather to construct sluice gates. They aim to block mountain water and convert dry land into paddy fields to strive for a greater harvest. To date, Yuxi Prefecture has constructed and repaired 1,739 dams and ponds, and 4,046 irrigation ditches, in addition to 11 medium-sized water conservancy projects. These water conservancy projects can irrigate nearly 100,000 mu of land. In Zhaotong Prefecture, just in the seven counties of Yongshan, Yanjin, Yiliang, Zhenxiong, Ludian, Qiaojia, and Huize, over the past ten days, 1,474 irrigation ditches and 54 dams and ponds have been constructed and repaired, capable of irrigating over 15,000 mu. Other prefectures have also successively begun constructing water conservancy projects.

    为今年获得更大的丰收创造有利条件
    安徽沿江治涝工程全面开工
    云南玉溪、昭通等地积极兴修水利
    据新华社讯　安徽省沿长江一百九十二个大圩的治涝工程已经全面开工，每天上工的民工有十八万多人。他们共要开挖新沟六百五十二条，整修旧沟两百三十一条，新建和整修小型水库六座、涵闸斗门三百二十四处。这些工程完成以后，今年就可以使一百零四万多亩圩田不再受涝。
    安徽省沿长江一带盛产水稻，那里的圩区是水稻的高产区。在两千多个大、小圩里，有农田六百万亩左右。这些圩田依江傍河，有的地势低洼，有的排水设备不善，常常受到涝灾。1956年受涝减产的圩田就有一百三十二万亩，其中有五十五万亩颗粒无收。过去几年中，沿江地带整修堤防任务大，劳动力不够分配，因此圩区治涝工程没有动手兴修。今年由于修堤任务已经基本完成，沿江各地的共产党组织便开始大力领导圩区农民兴修治涝工程。
    本报讯　为了争取今年更大的丰收，云南省玉溪、昭通等地正在积极兴修水利工程。玉溪专区自去年冬天转社后即全体投入了冬季生产和春耕准备工作。他们特别抓紧了水利工作这一环，从县到区到社都有干部专门负责。中共江川县委会就有一个县委副书记和四个县委委员专门负责水利工作。整个专区每天都有七万六千多人参加兴修小型水利工程，不少县份都做出了显著的成绩。其中昆阳县已兴修和整修了坝塘一百九十七个，新开水沟五十六条，正在动工的还有四十一个坝塘。全县三百九十八个坝塘的蓄水量已达到70％以上。易门县计划兴修、整修的二百五十七处小型水利工程，已完工二百三十多处。澄江县松元乡是高山地区，无河流又无塘，现在，社员们正冒着寒冷的天气兴修水闸。他们要把山水堵起来，把旱地改成水田，争取更大的丰收。到目前为止，玉溪专区除十一项中型水利工程外，已兴修、整修坝塘一千七百三十九个，水沟四千零四十六条。这些水利工程，可以增灌近十万亩土地。昭通专区，仅永善、盐津、彝良、镇雄、鲁甸、巧家、会泽七个县，十多天来就兴修和整修了水沟一千四百七十四条，坝塘五十四个，计可增灌一万五千多亩。其他各专区也都已先后着手兴修水利工程。
