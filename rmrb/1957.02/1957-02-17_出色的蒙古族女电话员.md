    Outstanding Mongolian Female Telephone Operator

    In the Tumurtai telephone exchange on the Jining-Erlian railway line, there is often a female comrade wearing a headset, concentrating and busily operating the switchboard.

    "Who is she?" I asked Zhang Jitai, the chief of the Jining Telecommunications Section, once.

    "She's a Mongolian girl named Shamuga."

    "She's only sixteen years old this year," Bai Xiuying, the leader of the telephone exchange, said with a smile, taking over the conversation, "She's very clever. She's only been at the exchange for a few months, and now she can operate independently."

    After work, I went to visit her.

    She was born on the Hulunbuir Grassland. Her father and mother died when she was young, and she lived with her brother and sister-in-law. After graduating from elementary school in the summer of the year before last, she helped the family with labor. Last March, when the news of the railway department recruiting young workers came, she went to Ulanhot to register for the exam.

    Shamuga was admitted after taking the exam in Ulanhot. After learning about railway business and regulations in Jining for ten days, she continued to study at the telephone class of the Shuangta Railway Workers School in Taiyuan. There, for more than two months, because she studied hard, she finally graduated with good grades.

    Shamuga was assigned to Tumurtai telephone exchange for internship. In order to help her quickly master telephone operating techniques, the exchange asked telephone operator Cui Fenglan to sign a "master-apprentice contract" with her. Cui Fenglan taught her operating techniques and regulations such as connecting lines, disconnecting lines, and answering users almost hand-in-hand.

    During Shamuga's days as an intern at the telephone exchange, the Party and Youth League leaders of Tumurtai often encouraged her: "Little Shamuga, study hard and become an excellent telephone operator on the railway." Last November, she was selected to go to Jining to attend the Youth League Congress. In just a few months, she was already operating independently very well.

    "The telephone on the railway is like a person's ear. I know that my skills are not yet high, and I will study harder in the future, striving to better exert my strength on the railway line of the motherland's grassland." This is Shamuga's earnest wish.

    出色的蒙古族女电话员
    在集宁到二连铁路线上土牧尔台电话所里，经常有一位头上戴着送受话器的女同志，在聚精会神、紧张繁忙地操作着。
    “她是谁呢？”有一次，我问集宁电务段长张继泰同志。
    “她是个蒙古族姑娘，叫莎木嘎。”
    “今年才十六岁呢，”电话所的领班白秀英同志，笑容满面地接过话头去说，“心眼儿可机灵啦，才到所里几个月工夫，现在就能够单独操作了。”
    下班以后，我去访问了她。
    她生在呼伦贝尔草原。从小就死了爸爸、妈妈，跟着哥哥、嫂嫂过活。前年夏天小学毕业以后，她就帮家里劳动。去年3月间，铁路部门招收青年职工的消息传来了，她便去乌兰浩特报名投考。
    莎木嘎在乌兰浩特经过考试后被录取了。在集宁学了十来天铁路方面的业务、规章以后，又到太原双塔铁路职工学校电话班继续学习。在那里两个多月，由于她刻苦学习，终于以良好的成绩毕业了。
    莎木嘎被分配到土牧尔台电话所实习。为了帮助她很快地掌握电话操作技术，所里请电话员崔凤兰和她订立了“师徒合同”。崔凤兰几乎是手把手地教给她接线、撤线、答对用户等操作技术和规章。
    莎木嘎在电话所见习的日子里，土牧尔台的党、团负责同志时常鼓励她：“小莎木嘎，好好学习，当个铁路上优秀的电话员。”去年11月间，她被选派到集宁去出席了团代表大会。很短几个月，她已经单独操作的很好了。
    “铁路上的电话好比人的耳朵。我知道自己的技术还不高，今后更要努力学习，争取在祖国草原的铁路线上，更好地发挥出自己的一份力量。”这是莎木嘎恳切的心愿。
