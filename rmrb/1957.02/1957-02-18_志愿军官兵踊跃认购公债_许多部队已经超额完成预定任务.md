Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th. Many units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have already exceeded their assigned quotas for the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds. The leading organs of a certain Volunteer Army unit stationed in the Shangganling area exceeded the assigned quota by 38% on the second day of subscription.

Out of enthusiasm for supporting the socialist construction of the motherland, the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army enthusiastically purchased government bonds with the money they usually saved. Ji Yingfeng, the battalion commander of the health center of a certain Volunteer Army unit stationed on the west coast, consistently lived frugally and purchased 500 yuan worth of government bonds this time. Although Liu Mingxian, the section chief of the management department of a certain Volunteer Army unit stationed in the Gusan area, had a relatively heavy family burden, he still purchased government bonds with his entire month's salary.

    志愿军官兵踊跃认购公债
    许多部队已经超额完成预定任务
    新华社平壤17日电　中国人民志愿军的许多部队，已经超额完成1957年国家经济建设公债的预定认购任务。驻守上甘岭地区的志愿军某部领导机关在开始认购的第二天，认购数字就超过了分配数字的38％。
    志愿军的广大官兵出于支援祖国社会主义建设的热情，把平时节省下来的钱踊跃购买了公债。驻西海岸志愿军某部卫生所长冀应凤大尉一贯省吃俭用，这次他认购了五百元的公债。驻谷山地区志愿军某部管理科长刘名先大尉，虽然家庭负担比较重，但他还是以一个月的全部薪金购买了公债。
