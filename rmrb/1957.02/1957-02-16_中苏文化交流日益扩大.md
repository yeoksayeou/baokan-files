    Sino-Soviet Cultural Exchange Increasingly Expanding
    Large Numbers of Soviet Books in Chinese Translation Soon to be Published

    This year, various publishing houses in our country will publish a large number of Chinese translations of Soviet books. The People's Publishing House initially plans to publish more than 80 translated Soviet works this year, with an estimated circulation of more than 1.6 million copies. The People's Literature Publishing House is preparing to organize the translation and publication of more than 30 Soviet literary works this year, with an estimated circulation of more than 400,000 copies.

    Among the Soviet books in Chinese translation planned to be published by various publishing houses in our country this year, in the fields of politics, economics, and philosophy, in addition to continuing to publish "The Complete Works of Lenin" and "The Complete Works of Stalin," will also be published Plekhanov's "Against Revisionism in Philosophy" and "History of the Soviet National Economy," and others.

    Books on Soviet education and literature to be translated and published this year include: "The Complete Works of Makarenko," Plekhanov on art, Plekhanov's "Art and Social Life" and "On Western European Literature," a collection of Chernyshevsky's aesthetic essays, "History of the Ideological Struggle in Soviet Literature," a collection of Gorky's literary essays, a selection of Mayakovsky, as well as Ehrenburg's "Without Respite," one of two famous novellas written between 1933 and 1934, and the novel "The Second Day," which describes the labor enthusiasm of the Soviet people during the first five-year plan, and Simonov's "Comrades in Arms" - this novel reflects the heroic struggle of the Soviet army against Japanese imperialism on the shores of Lake Hasan in 1939.

    Increasing Contacts Between Higher Education Departments

    Contacts between the Sino-Soviet higher education departments are constantly strengthening and expanding. At present, 18 universities in our country have established direct contacts with 18 universities in the Soviet Union. This year, the number of universities in direct contact between China and the Soviet Union will be further expanded. Universities in direct contact between China and the Soviet Union regularly exchange teaching materials and exchange experiences.

    This year, according to the Sino-Soviet Cultural Agreement, the Sino-Soviet higher education departments will invite scientific teaching staff to give special lectures, send professors and teachers from universities to understand the experience of teaching work, jointly organize editorial groups to compile Russian and Chinese textbooks for universities, and continue to send students to each other.

    Sino-Soviet Film Studios to Co-Produce Films

    Sino-Soviet film cooperation plans will have great development this year. The initial plan is to co-produce a feature film this year with the theme of the creative cooperation between steelworkers from China and the Soviet Union. The script for this film will also be jointly written by writers from China and the Soviet Union. In addition, two wide-screen color documentaries and a scientific education film will be co-produced. The two documentaries will depict the Yangtze River and the Volga River, and the theme of the scientific education film is about the Almaty-Lanzhou Railway.

    In addition to co-producing films, this year will also see the holding of two premieres of each other's films, and delegations will be sent to participate in these mass activities.

    Cooperation in Broadcasting Continues to Develop

    Cooperation in Sino-Soviet broadcasting is constantly developing. Now, listeners in our country can hear the programs broadcast by the Soviet Union to our listeners on the Central People's Broadcasting Station of our country every day, and Soviet listeners can also hear programs broadcast by the Chinese to Soviet listeners by the Soviet radio station twice a week. In addition, the radio stations of both China and the Soviet Union frequently exchange other radio programs and materials. According to statistics last year, the Soviet Union sent more than 1,600 minutes of music recordings to our radio station alone, and our radio station sent more than 1,200 minutes to the Soviet Union. These broadcasts have been warmly welcomed by listeners from both sides. According to statistics from January to February 10 this year alone, our radio station received 1,128 letters from Soviet listeners.
