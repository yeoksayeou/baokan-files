Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 10th: This year, the Sichuan River will add eight large tugboats, two large freighters, and thirteen large iron barges. Two passenger and cargo ships will also be converted into tugboats. The construction and conversion projects for these ships have been included in the annual production plans of shipyards in Chongqing, Shanghai, and other places.

Since liberation, transportation on the Sichuan River has become increasingly busy. Taking Chongqing Port as an example, the throughput in 1956 increased by 6.48 times compared to 1950. Although twelve new tugboats and forty-four new barges joined the transportation force last year, they still could not meet the growing transportation demands. After these ships are put into operation successively this year, the horsepower of tugboats on the Sichuan River will increase by 47.57%, the tonnage of barges will increase by 24.85%, and the number of freighters will increase by 7.41%.

In order to enable the newly built ships to participate in transportation immediately after leaving the factory, the Sichuan River shipping department has trained more than 1,000 senior crew members and more than 3,000 intermediate crew members through spare-time technical studies last year. They have also familiarized more than 1,700 newly recruited crew members with the Sichuan River ship transportation work.

After ten new tugboats and thirteen new barges are put into production this year, more than 800 new crew members will be needed. The Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration Bureau has decided not to add a single person but to streamline the crew members of the original ships to support the new ships.

### 川江将添一批船只

    川江将添一批船只
    据新华社重庆10日电　川江今年又要新添八只大型拖轮、两只大型货轮、十三条大铁驳，并把两只客货轮改建为拖轮。现在这些船只的新建、改建工程已经列入重庆、上海等地造船厂的今年年度生产计划。
    解放几年来，川江运输日趋繁忙。以重庆港为例，1956年的吞吐量比1950年增加了六点四八倍。去年虽然有十二只新拖轮和四十四条新驳船参加运输，仍旧不能满足日益增长的运输要求。今年这些船只陆续参加运输以后，可使川江拖轮马力增加47.57％，驳船吨位增加24.85％，货轮增加7.41％。
    为了使新建船舶在出厂以后能立刻参加运输，去年川江航运部门用业余学习技术的办法已经培养出一千多名高级船员，三千多名中级船员，而且使一千七百多名新吸收的船员熟悉了川江轮船运输工作。
    今年十只新拖轮和十三只新驳船投入生产以后，需要增加新船员八百多人。长江航运管理局重庆分局决定不增加一个人，精简原有船只的船员，来支援新船。
