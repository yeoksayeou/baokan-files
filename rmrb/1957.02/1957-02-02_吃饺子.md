Eating Dumplings	Tao Dun
    I remembered a Spring Festival during the Anti-Japanese War.

    The military and civilians in the base areas had grasped the enemy's pattern. Every Spring Festival, they would come out to harass, rob, and burn houses, making it impossible for people to enjoy the festival in peace. Therefore, when the Spring Festival arrived, the higher authorities would assign some comrades to be scattered among the masses to live with them and jointly fight against the enemy. During the Spring Festival of 1943, the leadership assigned me from the center of Junan County to Lianhua Wang Village in Zhuanggang District.

    On New Year's Eve, every household was making dumplings. I was chatting with the village cadres, stirring the fire, eating peanuts, and talking about the things that had happened during the year. Suddenly, militiamen reported that five plainclothes comrades had come to find lodging, claiming to be from the Rushan Brigade. The village chief told the militiamen to lead them to a house at the entrance of the village to stay first. Afterward, we took our guns and went to investigate.

    These comrades were quickly settled. From the unpapered window lattices, we could see that they were all writing something under the lamplight. We pushed the door open and saw that they were five comrades from the editorial department of Dazhong Daily, and I recognized almost all of them.

    "Why are you here at this time?" I asked.

    "The enemy has entered Shizilu, and we've moved here," one comrade replied.

    "What about eating dumplings?" I saw that they had made no preparations for the festival.

    "We can't worry about that. We have to publish the newspaper!" While talking to them, they didn't even leave their seats, and everyone was still working non-stop: some were writing, some were cutting stencils, and some were organizing the mimeograph machine with only one page frame and a leather roller. Their newspaper couldn't be printed with lead type, so they used lithography; if they couldn't use lithography, they used mimeograph. No matter how tense the situation, they never missed an issue.

    After coming out, I whispered to the village chief, "Look, it's New Year's Eve, and they are still working there, unable to even eat dumplings!" The village chief thought for a moment and said, "There's a way. We can't let the comrades from our newspaper not have dumplings to eat."

    Almost midnight, the village chief asked a militiaman to carry a box and knock on the doors of each house. Every family was making dumplings, and some had already finished. The village chief called out to the neighbors, addressing them as uncles, grandpas, grandmas, and aunts, saying, "The enemy has entered Shizilu, and the comrades from our newspaper have come. They are rushing to publish the newspaper tomorrow and don't even have time to make dumplings. Is it okay to let the army comrades not have dumplings to eat during the New Year? Let's each family take out two or three dumplings, which will be enough for them to have a meal. What do you think?" Before he could finish speaking, the owners brought the dumplings and poured them into the box. The village chief said that only two were needed, but they insisted. After visiting only half of the eighty-plus households, there were already more than three hundred dumplings.

    The dumplings were delivered, and the village chief explained the villagers' intentions. The five comrades were so moved that they were about to cry. They just said, "Thank you everyone! Thank you everyone!"

    At daybreak, I went to their place again, and their dumplings were already cooked. At this time, they were biting open dumplings with different fillings and different skins, chewing them slowly. From their joyful faces, I thought they must have felt that these dumplings were filled with the people's enthusiasm for loving the army.

    Three small packages were already prepared. After eating the dumplings, they were going to distribute the printed newspapers. (Chen Zhi illustration) (Attached picture)

    吃饺子	陶钝
    记起了抗日战争时期一次过春节的事来。
    根据地的军民已经掌握了敌人的规律，每到春节他们就出来骚扰、抢东西、烧房子，使人们在春节过不安稳。所以到了春节上级就把一部分同志分散到群众中去和群众一起生活共同进行对敌斗争。1943年的春节，领导上把我从莒南县的中心分配到壮岗区莲花汪村。
    除夕夜里，家家户户在包饺子，我同村干部们拨着火，吃着花生，谈这一年来经历的事情。突然民兵来报告说有五位便衣的同志来找房子住，自称是鲁山大队。村长叫民兵领到村头的一家去先住下。随后我们提着枪去察看。
    这几位同志很快就被安置好了，从没有糊纸的窗棂间看见他们都在灯光底下写什么。我们推门进去，一看，原来是大众日报编辑部的五位同志，差不多我都认得。
    “怎么这时候来了？”我问。
    “敌人进了十字路，我们转移到这里。”一位同志回答。
    “怎么吃饺子呢？”我看到他们并没有过节的准备。
    “顾不得，我们要出报！”和他们谈话时他们连座也没离开，各人还在不停的工作：有的在编写，有的在刻腊纸，有的正在整理只有一个版架和皮滚子的油印机。他们的报不能铅印就石印，不能石印就油印，无论情况怎么紧张从来不脱期。
    出来以后，我低声地对村长说：“你看，年三十了，他们还在那里劳动，连饺子也没有办法吃！”村长想了想说：“有办法，不能叫咱报社的同志吃不上饺子。”
    快要夜半了，村长约一个民兵端着一个盒子叫开各家的门，各家正好在包饺子，有的已经包完了。村长对着邻居们叫着叔叔、大爷、大娘、大婶说：“敌人进了十字路，咱报社的同志来了，赶着明天出报，连饺子也顾不得包，过年?叫军队的同志吃不上饺子还行，咱们一家拿出两三个饺子就够他们吃一顿的了，您看怎么样？”话不等说完，主人就把饺子端过来往盒子里倒，村长说只要两个就行了，他们怎么也不依。八十多户人家，只串了一半，已经有三百多个了。
    饺子送了去，村长把村里群众的意思讲了讲。五位同志感动的要流泪了。只是说：“谢谢大家！谢谢大家！”
    天刚明，我再到他们那里去，他们的饺子已经煮好了。这时候他们咬开一个个不同馅，不同皮子的饺子慢慢地嚼着，从他们欢悦的脸上来看，我想他们一定会感觉到这饺子里都包着人民热爱军队的热情。
    三个小包袱已经打好了。吃完饺子，他们就要把印好的报发出去。（陈志插图）（附图片）
