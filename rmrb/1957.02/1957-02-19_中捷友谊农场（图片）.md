    Sino-Czech Friendship Farm
    Located on the Bohai beach in Huanghua County, Hebei Province, the newly established Sino-Czech Friendship Farm in August 1956 is beginning to change the face of the saline-alkali land on the beach. The hard, barren land has gradually been transformed into loose farmland. After the farm is fully completed and put into production this year, it can produce a large quantity of cotton, grain, pigs, horses, cattle, and sheep for the country every year.

    中捷友谊农场
    河北省黄骅县境内的渤海滩上，1956年8月新建立起来的中捷友谊农场，开始改变着海滩盐碱地的面貌。死硬的荒地已逐渐变成松软的农田。这个农场今年全部建成投入生产以后，每年可以为国家生产大批棉花、粮食、猪、马、牛、羊。
