Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 22nd: The local organizations of various democratic parties in Hubei Province and Wuhan City have greatly developed over the past year. More than one hundred professors, engineers, and scientists have joined the Jiusan Society in Wuhan City. Half a year ago, the Jiusan Society had only a centrally-affiliated group of nineteen people in Wuhan City; now it has established its branches in eight universities and colleges, including Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, Wuhan University, and Wuhan Medical College. The development of other democratic parties' organizations in the area last year also greatly exceeded any previous year. The China National Democratic Construction Association and the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party respectively absorbed nine hundred and three hundred new members last year, which is twice and one and a half times their original membership, respectively. The current membership of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has also increased by more than 50% compared to the first half of last year.

In order to adapt to the new situation after the organizational development, the democratic parties have also made a series of adjustments to their organizational structures. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association has established preparatory organizations in Yichang and Shashi, and the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has also stationed working groups in Shashi to actively carry out the work of developing organizations.

    各民主党派湖北省武汉市组织发展很快
    新华社武汉22日电　各民主党派在湖北省或武汉市的地方组织，一年来有了很大发展。有一百多位教授、工程师和科学工作者在武汉市参加了九三学社。半年前九三学社在武汉市只有一个由十九人组成的中央直属小组；而现在在中南财经学院、武汉大学、武汉医学院等八个大专学校里设立了它的分支机构。其他民主党派在当地的组织去年的发展也大大超过了以往任何一年。中国民主建国会和中国农工民主党去年分别吸收了九百和三百多名新成员，各为原有成员的两倍和一倍半。中国国民党革命委员会现在的成员也比去年上半年增加了50％多。
    为了适应组织发展后的新情况，各民主党派对组织机构还作了一系列的调整。民建武汉市委员会分别在宜昌、沙市两市设立了筹备机构，民革湖北省委员会在沙市也派驻了工作组，积极进行发展组织的工作。
