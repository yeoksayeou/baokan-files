Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 15th: The State Central Statistical Bureau of the German Democratic Republic published a communiqué on the implementation of the national economic plan for 1956 on the 13th. The communiqué stated that the total output value of all industries in the German Democratic Republic in 1956 had increased to 107% of that in 1955, and had reached 202% compared to 1950. Last year, the proportion of socialist industry in the total industrial output value reached 88.8%.

The annual plan for central state-owned industrial production was 98% completed last year, and the local state-owned industries completed the annual plan. Thanks to the great efforts of the working people, the shortfall in plan completion that appeared in the first half of last year was eliminated. The output of products such as steel, aluminum alloy, gasoline, and sodium carbonate has completed the plan, while steel ingots, diesel, glass filament (perlon), underwear, paper, and artificial butter have overfulfilled the plan. However, some important industrial production departments have still not been able to complete the state plan.

The output of some major products in East Germany in 1956 is as follows: 31.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity (electricity production in 1955 was 28.7 billion kilowatt-hours—the figures in parentheses below are all the output of 1955); 2,743,000 tons of anthracite coal (2,667,000 tons); 205.9 million tons of lignite (200.6 million tons); 2,740,000 tons of steel ingots (2,507,000 tons); 2,036,000 tons of steel products (1,907,000 tons); 1,574,000 tons of pig iron (1,517,000 tons); 27,800 tons of rolling equipment (24,500 tons); 37,300 tons of lathes (27,400 tons); 27,300 automobiles (22,200 automobiles); 55,400 television sets (38,600 television sets); 159,500 high-quality cameras (151,300 cameras); 499.9 million square meters of various textiles (500.2 million square meters); 85,000 tons of oils and fats (78,200 tons); 193,500 tons of artificial butter (183,300 tons).

The communiqué then stated that mainly due to technological innovation and improved production organization, labor productivity in 1956 increased by 8% compared to 1955. The production costs of central state-owned industrial enterprises were reduced by 3.4%.

Investment in basic construction in 1956 increased by 34% compared to 1955, but the plan was not completed.

The communiqué said that in agriculture, the total output value of agriculture and forestry in 1956 increased by 1.2% compared to 1955. The unit area yield of grain has increased from 2,480 kilograms per hectare to 2,520 kilograms. The number of agricultural production cooperatives increased from 6,047 to 6,281. The cultivated land of agricultural production cooperatives already accounts for 23.2% of the total cultivated land in East Germany.

Regarding foreign trade, the communiqué said that the total trade volume in 1956 increased by 1.2 billion rubles compared to 1955. Compared to 1950, imports have increased two-fold and exports have increased two and a half-fold. Last year, the trade volume with countries such as India, Egypt, and Syria increased by about one to two times compared to 1955; the trade volume with West Germany increased by 12%.

The communiqué pointed out that various predetermined measures to improve people's lives have been fully realized. In 1956, the average wage of employees increased by 3%. Various annuities (including pensions and retirement pensions, etc.) have been increased. The total retail sales of goods for the whole year increased by 1 billion marks compared to 1955.

The communiqué also said that in 1956, the total number of students in East German universities and colleges reached 80,526, an increase of 5,784 over 1955. In this year, 10,389 university graduates were assigned to production departments.

    民主德国发表去年经济计划执行公报
    主要工业品产量和农林业总产量都有增长
    新华社柏林15日电　德意志民主共和国国家中央统计局13日发表了关于1956年国民经济计划执行情况的公报。公报说：德意志民主共和国1956年全部工业的总产值已经提高到1955年的107％，而同1950年相比，已经达到202％。去年社会主义工业占全部工业总产值的比重已经达到88.8％。
    去年中央国营工业生产的年度计划完成了98％，地方国营工业完成了年度计划。由于劳动人民的巨大努力，才消除了去年上半年出现的完成计划的差额。钢材、铝合金、汽油、碳酸钠等产品的产量已经完成计划，而钢锭、柴油、玻璃丝（派龙）、内衣、纸张和人造黄油等还超额完成了计划。但是，仍有一些重要工业生产部门没有能够完成国家计划。
    1956年民主德国一些主要产品的产量如下：电力三百一十二亿度（1955年的电力产量是二百八十七亿度——以下括弧里的数字都是1955年的产量）；原煤二百七十四万三千吨（二百六十六万七千吨）；褐煤二亿零五百九十万吨（二亿零六十万吨）；钢锭二百七十四万吨（二百五十万七千吨）；钢材二百零三万六千吨（一百九十万七千吨）；生铁一百五十七万四千吨（一百五十一万七千吨）；轧钢装备二万七千八百吨（二万四千五百吨）；车床三万七千三百吨（二万七千四百吨）；小汽车二万七千三百辆（二万二千二百辆）；电视机五万五千四百台（三万八千六百台）；高级照像机十五万九千五百个（十五万一千三百个）；各种纺织品四亿九千九百万平方公尺（五亿零二百万平方公尺）；油脂八万五千吨（七万八千二百吨）；人造黄油十九万三千五百吨（十八万三千三百吨）。
    公报接着说：主要由于技术的革新和生产组织的改善，1956年的劳动生产率比1955年提高了8％。中央国营工业企业的生产成本降低了3.4％。
    1956年基本建设的投资比1955年增加了34％，但是计划没有完成。
    公报说，在农业方面，1956年农林业的总产值比1955年增加了1.2％。谷物的单位面积产量已由每公顷二千四百八十公斤增加到二千五百二十公斤。农业生产合作社的数量由六千零四十七个增加到六千二百八十一个。农业生产合作社的耕地已经占民主德国耕地总面积的23.2％。
    关于对外贸易，公报说：1956年的贸易总额比1955年增加了十二亿卢布。和1950年相比，进口增加了两倍，出口增加了两倍半。去年同印度、埃及、叙利亚等国的贸易额比1955年增加了约一倍到两倍；同西德的贸易额增加了12％。
    公报指出：关于改善人民生活的各种预定措施已经完全实现。在1956年，职工平均工资增加了3％。各种年金（包括抚恤金和养老金等）有所提高。全年的商品零售额比1955年增加了十亿马克。
    公报还说：在1956年，民主德国的高等学校在校学生总数已达八万零五百二十六名，比1955年增加了五千七百八十四名。在这一年里，有一万零三百八十九名高等学校毕业生分配到生产部门中去。
