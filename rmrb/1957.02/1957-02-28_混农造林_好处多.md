"Intercropping Agroforestry" Has Many Benefits
Li Yuanzhou

China has a long history of developing intercropping agroforestry. As early as the Ming Dynasty, the mountainous people in the Yangtze River basin had already begun planting crops on a large scale within young Chinese fir forests. Intercropping agroforestry, also known as the combined forestry-grain planting method, involves planting food crops or cash crops on forest land in the first few years after afforestation.

Many crops can be planted on forest land, including grains, oilseeds, cotton, vegetables, and medicinal materials. The planting period for crops is generally three to five years. A few crops have longer harvest periods because they grow together with the trees. The sowing time for various crops varies, so there are plantings and harvests throughout the year.

In recent years, with the development of agriculture and forestry in mountainous areas, the area of intercropping agroforestry has been expanding. In the past, intercropping agroforestry was limited to the mountainous areas of the south, but now some mountainous areas in the north are using the "fish scale pit" method to plant crops in forest land, achieving good results. Some state-owned forest farms, seeing the many benefits of intercropping agroforestry by the masses, have also begun planting coarse grains on newly afforested land. In 1954, the Wugang Forest Farm in Hunan Province had a total of 5,400 mu of mountain land combining forestry and grain production, harvesting 1.2 million jin of grain.

The broad masses in mountainous areas like to adopt the intercropping agroforestry method for certain reasons.

First, intercropping agroforestry can increase grain production. There are many barren mountains and few farmlands in mountainous areas, with an average of only about one mu of cultivated land per person. It is not enough to rely solely on a small amount of farmland to increase grain income. For a long time, the people in mountainous areas have increased production in the following two ways: cultivating steep slopes to plant coarse grains, which has resulted in severe soil erosion, and even the destruction of farmland and villages, outweighing the gains; the other is planting crops on newly afforested land, afforesting and harvesting grain every year, which does not damage soil and water conservation and increases the current income of the masses. The masses in the southern mountainous areas have achieved significant results in grain production using this method. In 1953, Longchi Township in Youxi, Fujian, produced more than 628,000 jin of grain from farmland, which could only supply the township's residents with 226 days of food. In 1954, 1,627 mu of coarse grains were intercropped in the forest, harvesting more than 244,000 jin of grain. This alone was enough for the people of the entire township to eat for 105 days. This shows that intercropping agroforestry is indeed a good way to increase grain production.

Second, intercropping agroforestry can overcome the disadvantage of having no income during the growth period of trees. While planting Chinese fir, the masses in the southern mountainous areas also plant tung trees and intercrop coarse grains for the first three years. In the fourth year, the tung trees bloom and bear fruit, harvesting tung seeds for three or four consecutive years. The Chinese fir gradually reaches closure, the tung trees decline, and after more than ten years, the Chinese fir has grown into large timber, which can be felled and utilized. Afforestation, grain and tung seed harvesting, and timber felling are carried out in turn, continuously cycling, which is very popular among the masses in mountainous areas. The first agricultural and forestry cooperative in Hongyuan Township, Wuyuan, Jiangxi, adopts the agroforestry intercropping afforestation method, and currently can harvest 360 dan of corn per year, worth more than 2,700 yuan; tung trees yield 1,000 dan per year, worth 14,000 yuan; and Chinese fir can produce 2,000 pieces per year, worth 3,000 yuan. These incomes have become the main income of the cooperative. Although the types of intercropped crops and the intercropping methods vary from region to region, their common feature is that they closely integrate current-income production, short-term income production, and long-term income production, intercropping on the same land and generating income in stages.

Third, intercropping agroforestry can improve the survival rate of afforestation and promote the accelerated growth of trees. From 1950 to 1955, Liao Hongfu, a farmer in Baoxing Township, Peng County, Sichuan, planted 2,000 to 2,600 Cunninghamia lanceolata trees every year, and the survival rate of intercropping agroforestry reached 100%. In 1955, the Laifeng Forest Farm in Hubei planted maize in 300 mu of newly planted Chinese fir forest. According to the inspection in mid-August 1956, the intercropped Chinese fir averaged 35.29 cm in height, which was 1.5 to 2 times that of the Chinese fir planted on abandoned land, and 2 to 3 times that of the Chinese fir planted by hoeing pits on barren hills. Similar situations exist in other regions.

The high survival rate and rapid growth of intercropping agroforestry are mainly because the operation of farming crops, loosening the soil, and weeding at the same time also play a role in comprehensive land preparation and tending for afforestation, creating good conditions for the growth of young trees.

Now, China is carrying out the great cause of greening the motherland, and at the same time, it is necessary to vigorously develop diversified operations in mountainous areas, increase grain production, and improve the living standards of the people in mountainous areas. Therefore, promoting intercropping agroforestry is beneficial to both the country and the masses.

    “混农造林”好处多
    栗元周
    我国营造混农林的历史很久，早在明朝以前，长江流域的山区群众已开始在杉木幼林内大面积地种植农作物。混农造林，也有人把它叫做林粮结合的造林方法，就是在刚刚造林以后的头几年，在林地种植粮食作物或经济作物。
    在林地上可以种植很多作物，粮食、油料、棉花、蔬菜、药材等都可以种。作物种植的年限，一般是三年到五年。少数作物因与树木共生共长，收获期较长。各种作物播种时间不同，一年四季都有种有收。
    近几年来，随着山区农业和林业的发展，混农造林的地区日益扩大。从前混农造林仅限于南方山区，目前北方某些山区用“鱼鳞坑”的办法，在林地种植农作物，取得较好的经验。某些国营林场，看到群众混农造林好处很多，也开始在新造林地上种植杂粮。湖南省武冈林场在1954年，林粮结合生产的山地面积共五千四百亩，收获粮食一百二十万斤。
    广大山区群众喜欢采用混农造林方法，是有一定原因的。
    首先是混农造林可以增加粮食生产。山区荒山多，农田少，平均每人只有耕地一亩左右，单单依靠少量农田增加粮食收入是不够的。长时期以来，山区人民除了提高农田产量外，还从以下两个方面来增产：开陡坡种杂粮，然而结果是造成严重的水土冲刷，甚至冲毁农田、庄园，得不偿失；另外是在新造林地上种植农作物，年年造林，年年收粮，既不破坏水土保持，又可增加群众当前收益。南方山区群众用这个办法已在粮食增产方面取得显著成绩。福建尤溪龙尺乡在1953年，农田产谷六十二万八千多斤，只能供给全乡群众二百二十六天的口粮；1954年，在林内混种杂粮一千六百二十七亩，收获粮食二十四万四千多斤，只此一项就可以够全乡人民吃一百零五天。由此可见，混农造林确是增加粮食生产的好办法。
    第二，混农造林可以克服林木生长期没有收益的缺点。南方山区群众在栽植杉木的同时点种了油桐，在头三年混种杂粮，第四年油桐开花结果，连收三、四年桐籽，杉木已逐渐达到郁闭，油桐衰败，再过十多年，杉木已长成了大材，就可砍伐利用了。又造林，又收粮食和油桐，又砍木材，逐年更替，循环不断，很受山区群众欢迎。江西婺源洪源乡第一农林合作社采用农林混作的造林方法，目前每年可收玉米三百六十担，价值二千七百多元；油桐每年收入一千担，合一万四千元；杉木每年可产二千根，值三千元；这些收入成为了这个社的主要收入。各个地区混种作物的种类和混种的方式，虽然不尽相同，但是，它们的共同特点是，将当年有收益的生产、短期有收益的生产和长期有收益的生产紧密结合起来，同地混作，分期收益。
    第三，混农造林可以提高造林成活率，促进林木加速生长。四川彭县宝兴乡农民廖洪富在1950年到1955年，每年种植柳杉二千到二千六百株，混农造林的成活率达百分之百。湖北来凤林场1955年在三百亩新造杉木林内种植了玉蜀黍，根据1956年8月中旬的检查，混农的杉木平均高达35.29公分，为抛荒地所造杉木的一倍半到二倍，为荒山穴垦造的杉木二到三倍。其他各地，都有类似情况。
    混农林之所以成活率高、生长快，主要是因为在经营农作物翻松土地和中耕除草的同时，也对造林起了全面整地和抚育的作用，给幼树的生长创造了良好的条件。
    现在，我国正进行着绿化祖国的伟大事业，同时在山区又需要大力开展多种经营，增加粮食生产，提高山区人民生活水平。因此，提倡混农造林，无论对国家对群众都是有利的。
