    Honesty and Cleverness
    Fú Xiān
    I often think: we should be clever and honest people, not hypocritical and clever people.
    Some people are simply honest, saying whatever they see and speaking whatever they think. But firstly, what they see may not be the essence of things, and what they think may not be objective truth, so there are bound to be mistakes; secondly, even if they see accurately and think correctly, speaking it out directly without considering the time, place, and conditions may have a negative impact on the environment and cause them to run into trouble. These people are called "clumsily sincere," which has shortcomings, but the basic quality is good. The honesty of an honest person lies in not telling lies; a clever honest person speaks accurately, paying attention not only to the content but also to the timing, manner, and degree, without speaking carelessly.
    Hypocritical clever people, on the other hand, are those "who rely solely on their intelligence and do not value sincerity," the "cunning" ones. Liu Ye of Wei during the Three Kingdoms period was such a person. He was once valued by the emperor for his "wisdom and strategic planning." But later, someone suggested to the emperor, "Liu Ye is only good at discerning the emperor's intentions and catering to them, not truly loyal. Your Majesty can try him by speaking your opinions in reverse; if he opposes, then he truly agrees with the imperial will; if he agrees, then he is dishonest." The emperor tried it and indeed discovered that Liu Ye was dishonest, and from then on, distanced himself from him. Liu Ye went mad because of this and died in sorrow. Fu Xuan of Jin concluded on this matter: "Cunning is not as good as clumsy sincerity," which is absolutely right.
    From the perspective of being a person, dialectical materialism is the philosophy that teaches people to be clever and honest. "The materialist conception of the world is nothing more than the understanding of nature as it is, without any extraneous additions" (Engels), which teaches people to be honest and sincere. Dialectics "reflects the comprehensiveness and unity of the material process" (Lenin), which teaches people to be clever and flexible. Therefore, being materialist and dialectical means being honest and clever. Some people are materialist but not dialectical—that is, their materialism is not thorough. Their attitude is honest, but they cannot truly achieve seeking truth from facts, and are limited to "clumsy sincerity." Others do not value materialism but enjoy dialectics, indulging in cleverness and flexibility, which results in distorting dialectics. As Lenin said, applying flexibility subjectively is equal to eclecticism and sophistry. But a person, especially a revolutionary, must always take sincerity as the foundation, that is, take morality as the foundation. Therefore, when studying dialectical materialism, one must first truly grasp the spirit of materialism, and then proceed to study "material" dialectics. Dialectical materialism is of course a unified and inseparable philosophy, but comprehending and establishing the spirit of materialism is relatively easy, while learning dialectics is more difficult; before one has fully learned dialectical materialism, it is better to lean towards "clumsy sincerity" than to descend into "cunning."
    The advisor who tricked Liu Ye had a truly ingenious idea; and the emperor who was able to adopt this suggestion was also quite clever, knowing that the flattery of cunning people like Liu Ye was not true loyalty. Now, if there are still individual leaders who regard those who disregard facts and simply cater to them as good cadres, then they neither know that these "good cadres" are not necessarily loyal to the revolutionary cause in the first place, nor do they know that these "good cadres" are not necessarily loyal to the leaders they are flattering.
    However, cadres' catering to their superiors is not necessarily entirely due to their own "cunning." The "People's Daily" once published a short essay titled "In Front of Superiors," which said that some cadres, when their superiors said that the plan was too conservative, would also say it was conservative; and when the same superior suddenly said that the same plan was too rash, they would also say it was rash. Such cadres naturally have serious shortcomings; but can we only blame their self-abasement, dishonesty, or cunning? I don't think so. Leaders who like others to cater to them are largely responsible, or even primarily responsible, for the emergence of such cadres. "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked." This old saying still makes sense.
    If leaders can tolerate clumsily sincere cadres while being wary of cunning cadres, it will be of great help in overcoming subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism.

### 老实和聪明

    老实和聪明
    弗先
    我常常想：我们要做一个聪明的老实人，不要做一个虚伪的聪明人。
    有的人，一味老实，怎样看到就怎样说，怎样想到也就怎样讲。但一则，看到的未必是事物的本质，想到的也未必是客观的真理，总不免有错处；二则，即使看准了，想对了，但不问时间、地点和条件，无保留地直说出来，有时会对环境发生不良影响，而自己则碰了钉子。这种人叫做“拙诚”，是有缺点的，但基本的品质是好的。老实人之老实，在于不说假话；聪明的老实人，则话要说得准，不但内容准，而且时机、方式和分寸都要讲究，不随便说。
    虚伪的聪明人，则是所谓“独任才智，不敦诚悫”的“巧诈”者。三国时魏的刘晔，就是这样的人。他曾以“明智权计”，为皇帝所亲重。但后来，有人向皇帝建议道：“刘晔只是善于窥测上意，一味迎合，不是尽忠。陛下可以试一试，把自己的意见用反话说给他听；要是他反对，那就真正与圣意相同了；要是他赞成，他就是不老实了。”皇帝试了一试，果然发现刘晔是不老实，从此疏远了他。刘晔因此发了狂，以忧死。晋的傅玄，对这事作出结论道：“巧诈不如拙诚”，对极了。
    从做人方面说，辩证唯物主义就是教导人做聪明的老实人的哲学。“唯物主义的世界观，不过是对自然界本来面目的了解，而并不附加以任何外来的成份”（恩格斯），这就教人老实诚恳。辩证法“反映物质过程的全面性及其统一”（列宁），这就教人聪明、灵活。所以，唯物而辩证，这就老实而聪明。有些人，唯物而不辩证——也就是唯物主义不彻底，态度是老实的，但不能真正做到实事求是，只局限于“拙诚”。另一些人，不重唯物而喜辩证，一味卖弄聪明和灵活，结果是歪曲了辩证法，如列宁所说，主观地应用灵活性，只等于折衷主义与诡辩。但一个人，尤其是一个革命的人，总须以诚为本，也就是以德为本；所以，在学习辩证唯物主义哲学的时候，首先必须切实掌握唯物主义的精神，然后进而学习“唯物的”辩证法。辩证唯物主义固然是统一的、不可割裂的哲学，但领会和确立唯物主义的精神是比较容易的，学会辩证法却较难；在还没有完全学会辩证唯物主义的时候，则宁可偏于“拙诚”而不可流于“巧诈”。
    使得刘晔上当的那个建议者，想的办法实在妙；而那个能够采用这建议的皇帝，也还不失其聪明，知道刘晔之类的巧诈者对自己的迎合并不是尽忠。现在倘若还有个别的领导人，把不顾事实，一味迎合自己的人当作好干部，那么，他就是既不知道这类“好干部”首先是对革命事业未必忠诚，也不知道这类“好干部”对所迎合的领导人也未必是忠诚的。
    但干部之迎合上级，不一定完全是由于他们本身的“巧诈”。“人民日报”上曾发表过一篇小品文“在上级面前”，里面说，有的干部，当上级说计划订得太保守了的时候，他就也说保守了；而当同一上级对同一计划忽然说是做得太冒进了的时候，他也就说冒进了。这样的干部，自然是有严重缺点的；但我们能够只怪他的妄自菲薄、不老实或巧诈么？我看不能。在一味喜欢别人迎合的领导者手下而产生这样的干部，领导者要负很大责任，或者甚至于主要责任。“上梁不正下梁歪”，这句老话还是有道理的。
    领导者如能容纳拙诚的干部而警惕巧诈的干部，这对于克服主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义，是大有帮助的。
