    Watching the Kunqu Opera "Zhong Kui Marries His Sister"
    Xu Ke

    Recently, I watched the Kunqu Opera "Zhong Kui Marries His Sister" performed by Mr. Hou Yushan from the Northern Kunqu Opera Troupe. I think this is a tragedy with profound significance.

    Zhong Kui was a talented and learned outstanding person. On his way to Chang'an to take the imperial examination, he mistakenly entered the Yinshan Ghost Path and was tricked by ghosts and monsters, which made his appearance extremely ugly and terrifying. The ugly and terrifying appearance determined Zhong Kui's tragic fate. Excellent writing ultimately could not change people's foolish views. This highly talented "Zhuangyuan" (top scorer in the imperial exam) was dismissed from his official position by the emperor simply because of his unattractive appearance. This extremely unfair treatment made Zhong Kui feel that he had no place in the world. In a situation where everyone blindly avoided him and feared him, Zhong Kui committed suicide in grief and indignation. In this way, Zhong Kui, with his tragic history, made a severe accusation against those who abandoned him. This work by the classical playwright Zhang Dafu, through the tragically exaggerated depiction of Zhong Kui, issued such a warning to people: Appearance may sometimes be completely inconsistent with the essence of things. All those who judge people by their appearance and all those who superficially observe things should learn a lesson from this. They should know that a strange and rare night-shining pearl may also be covered with a rough shell. If people's eyes only stay on its shell, that is a sin!

    "Marrying His Sister" is one act in this play. The simple plot is as follows: After Zhong Kui died, he was named the General of Expelling Evil and Eliminating Monsters by the God. He remembered that he had previously betrothed his sister to his good friend Du Ping, but the marriage had not yet been completed. So, he took his ghost soldiers home and personally sent his sister to Du's residence. Although the plot is simple, the matter is indeed sad. Here, we can see Zhong Kui wholeheartedly seeking happiness for others, but he is regarded as a monster. Even his former confidant friend now maintains an insurmountable distance from him. Superficially, this seems to be the distance between humans and ghosts, the boundary between the living and the dead, but in reality, it is a chasm drawn by the blind and the short-sighted.

    The image of Zhong Kui created by the veteran artist Hou Yushan on the stage spits fire from his mouth, has a terrifying face, and strange behavior, but he is kind-hearted, full of human touch, and his personality is very lovable. A character like this, with contradictions between appearance and inner self, is indeed a challenge for the actor. Superficial people may only portray the external form of the character, but well-trained performing artists are good at expressing the character's excellent qualities under the ugly appearance, thereby highlighting the profound ideological significance of this tragedy. Therefore, I think this is an extremely valuable artistic creation, rather than a common farce without any deep meaning.

    看昆剧“钟馗嫁妹”
    许可
    最近看了北方昆剧代表团侯玉山先生主演的“钟馗嫁妹”，觉得这是一出意义深刻的悲剧。
    钟馗，他是一个有才有学的优秀人物。在往长安赴考的途中，他因为误入阴山鬼径，受鬼怪作弄，以致使相貌变得奇丑，十分可怕。奇丑而又可怕的相貌，注定了钟馗的悲剧命运。锦绣文章，终究不能改变人们的愚蠢的看法，这位才高学广的“会元”，只是因为相貌难看，竟被皇帝革去了官职。这种极不公平的待遇，使钟馗感到他在人世间已没有了立足的地位。在人人都盲目地回避他、畏惧他的情况之下，钟馗悲愤地自杀了。这样，钟馗以他的悲剧历史，对弃捐他的人们提出了严厉的控诉。古典剧作家张大复的这一作品，通过钟馗的悲剧形象地夸大描绘，向人们发出了这样的警告！外观有时会和事物的实质完全不符。一切以貌取人者，一切从表面现象来观察事物的浅视者，都应该从这里获得教训。应该知道：一颗奇异的夜明珠，也可能蒙上一层粗恶的外壳，如果人的眼光只停留在它的外壳上，那就是罪过！
    “嫁妹”是这一剧作中的一折。那简单的情节是这样的：钟馗死后，被上帝封为驱邪斩祟将军。他想起从前曾把妹子许给好友杜平为妻，尚未完婚，于是便带了鬼卒回家，亲自把妹子送到杜府。情节虽然简单，但事情却确实可悲。在这里，我们可以看到一心为人谋求幸福的钟馗，却被人认为是鬼怪。即便是从前的知心朋友，现在也和他保持着一段不可逾越的距离。从表面上看，这似乎是人鬼的距离，幽明的界限，而实际上这却是盲目者，浅视者划定的鸿沟。
    老艺人侯玉山在舞台上创造的钟馗的形象，口喷火星，面目可怕，举止奇怪，但心地善良，极富人情味，性格非常可爱。像这种表里矛盾的人物，的确是演员的一个难题。浅薄的人也许只会刻划人物的外形，但修养有素的表演艺术家却善于在丑恶的外形下来表现人物的优良品质，从而突出这一悲剧的深刻的思想意义。因此，我以为，这是极可宝贵的艺术创造，而不是无甚深义的普通闹剧。
