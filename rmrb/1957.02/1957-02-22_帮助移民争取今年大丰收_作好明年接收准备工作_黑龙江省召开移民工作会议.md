Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th -- How were the achievements of immigration and land reclamation last year, and what are the work tasks for this year? This was the central topic of the Immigration Work Conference held by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party last week.

Last year, Heilongjiang Province resettled 260,000 immigrants from Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces, equivalent to 2% of Heilongjiang Province's original population. This was the largest immigration in China's history. Last year, immigrants began arriving in Heilongjiang Province in batches starting in March. With the help of local agricultural production cooperatives and land reclamation tractor stations, they reclaimed 380,000 hectares of wasteland in one year and sowed 240,000 hectares that same year. Although the sowing was somewhat late and they encountered significant natural disasters, they still harvested 170,000 tons of grain, which not only ensured the immigrants' entire grain consumption for the year but also allowed them to sell tens of thousands of tons of surplus grain to the state. Before the Spring Festival this year, a large number of young, single immigrants sent money to their relatives in their hometowns.

With the arrival of over 200,000 new residents, the face of the "Great Northern Wilderness" is rapidly changing. Last year alone, more than 25,000 houses were built on the wasteland. Gannan County, which resettled the most immigrants, added ninety villages in one year. In the past forty years, Luobei County's population had only grown to 14,000 people, but last year alone it increased by 11,000.

This year, the focus of immigration work in Heilongjiang Province is to concentrate efforts on helping existing immigrants achieve a bumper harvest of farmland, while also preparing to receive another 30,000 households of immigrants in 1958. All the land that has already been reclaimed in the new immigrant villages must be planted with crops this year, and the average yield per hectare is required to be no less than 2,000 jin (1,000 kg); in addition, various sideline productions must be actively developed; and the income from agricultural and sideline production for each immigrant should reach 350 to 400 yuan.

In order to accomplish these tasks, the ideological education of immigrants will be strengthened this year, educating immigrants to love labor, work hard, and pay attention to implementing the spirit of "running the cooperatives diligently and frugally." At present, the province, special districts, and counties are transferring a group of capable cadres to strengthen and adjust the leadership of the new immigrant villages. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party organizations and Communist Youth League organizations in the new villages have also been rectified, and the ideological level of Party and League members has been raised. Before the spring plowing, the new villages will carry out rectification work, improve the operation and management of the new villages, formulate long-term construction plans, annual production plans, and operation plans; implement effective operation and management systems, and pay attention to solving the egalitarianism and supply system mentality among immigrants while improving the financial management of the new villages.

### 帮助移民争取今年大丰收　作好明年接收准备工作  黑龙江省召开移民工作会议

    帮助移民争取今年大丰收　作好明年接收准备工作
    黑龙江省召开移民工作会议
    新华社哈尔滨19日电　去年一年移民垦荒成绩如何，今年的工作任务怎样？这是上星期中共黑龙江省委员会召开的移民工作会议的中心议题。
    黑龙江省去年安置了由山东、河北、河南三省来的移民二十六万人，等于黑龙江省原有人口的2％。这是我国有史以来最大规模的一次移民。去年移民从3月开始分批来到黑龙江省，在当地农业生产合作社和垦荒拖拉机站的帮助下，一年开垦了三十八万公顷荒地，当年播种了二十四万公顷。虽然播种迟了一些，又遇到较大的自然灾害，但是仍然收获了十七万吨粮食，不但保证了移民今年的全部吃粮，而且有几万吨余粮卖给了国家。今年春节前，大批年轻单身的移民，给故乡的亲属寄去了钱。
    随着二十几万新居民的到来，“北大荒”的面貌在迅速改变。去年一年，荒地上建起了两万五千多间房子。安置移民最多的甘南县，一年增加了九十个村庄。萝北县人口在过去四十年中，才发展到一万四千人，而去年一年就增加了一万一千人。
    今年黑龙江省的移民工作，主要是集中力量帮助现有移民争取农田大丰收，同时做好1958年再接收三万户移民的准备工作。移民新村所有已经开垦出来的土地，今年都要种上庄稼，并要求每公顷的平均单位面积产量不低于两千市斤；此外还要积极开展各种副业生产；每个移民的农副业生产收入要达到三百五十元到四百元。
    为了完成这些任务，今年将首先加强对移民的思想教育工作，教育移民热爱劳动，艰苦奋斗，注意贯彻“勤俭办社”的精神。目前，省、专区、县正抽调一批能力较强的干部，充实和调整移民新村的领导力量。同时对新村的中共党组织和青年团也进行了整顿，并提高党、团员的思想水平。春耕前，新村将进行整社工作，改善新村的经营管理，订出长远的建设计划、年度生产计划和作业计划；推行行之有效的经营管理制度，并在改进新村的财务管理工作中，注意解决移民中的平均主义和供给制思想。
