Xinhua News Agency, February 20th—Cadres and staff members of various agencies and organizations in Beijing have begun enthusiastically subscribing to the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds. As of today, several units, including the Foreign Trade Bureau, the First Commercial Bureau, the Chongwen District People's Committee, and the Supreme People's Court, have exceeded their subscription targets, with some units exceeding their planned subscription by more than double. The vast majority of cadres in these units have subscribed to the bonds, and in many units, the number of subscribers has reached 100%.

The biggest characteristic of this year's public bond subscription work is that it is being carried out early and quickly. Many district people's committees and their affiliated organizations completed their subscriptions and exceeded their planned targets on the same day, just after they started arranging the subscriptions on the 16th. The Dongsi District People's Committee and its affiliated units subscribed to over 23,000 yuan in less than a few hours after the meeting and exceeded the plan by more than 10%. During the subscription process, many people paid in cash on the spot. Liu Fuyi, a cadre of the Jingxi Mining Area People's Committee, had planned to buy more public bonds this year as early as last year. He saved his spare change every month and saved a total of 200 yuan before the subscription. He subscribed to all of them and immediately paid half of the amount in cash. Many people said that they would be frugal and save money that could be spent or not to buy public bonds. Song Xieyi, a cadre of the Eastern Suburbs District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, saved 100 yuan and originally planned to buy a watch, but he thought that it was not urgently needed at present, so he bought all the public bonds.

    北京各机关干部认购公债
    新华社20日讯　北京各机关、团体的干部，开始踊跃认购1957年国家经济建设公债。到今天为止，已有对外贸易局、第一商业局、崇文区人民委员会和最高人民法院等几十个单位，超额完成了认购数字，有的单位超额完成认购计划在一倍以上。这些单位的绝大部分干部都认购了公债，不少单位认购的人数达到了百分之百。
    今年公债认购工作的最大特点，是进行得又早又快。许多区人民委员会和其所属机构，在16日刚开始布置认购，当天就结束了，并都超额完成了认购计划。东四区人民委员会和所属单位在开会布置后不到几小时，就认购了二万三千多元，超额完成计划10％以上。在认购中，不少人都是当场交现款。京西矿区人民委员会干部刘甫诒早在去年就打算今年要多买些公债，每月就注意把省用的零花钱储蓄起来，认购前共储蓄了二百元，全部认购了公债，并且立即交了一半现款。不少人表示要俭朴节约，把可花可不花的钱存起来买公债。中共东郊区委员会干部宋协义积存了一百元，原打算买手表，他想到目前还不迫切需要，就全部买了公债。
