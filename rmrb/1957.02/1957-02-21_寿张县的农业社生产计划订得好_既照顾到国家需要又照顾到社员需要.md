Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng, 20th - The agricultural cooperatives in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, have rationally arranged the relationships between the state and the cooperative, and between cooperatives and their members, when formulating their production plan for this year.

The Communist Party organizations at all levels in Shou Zhang County and the cadres stationed in the communes first explained to the members the consistency of interests between the state and the commune, and between the commune and its members, and guided the communes to adopt the method of consultation with the members and unified arrangement to formulate plans and rationally handle the relationships between all parties. For example, the agricultural cooperatives in Taiqian, Jingyanggang and other townships, according to the state's task of grain and agricultural product purchase, made a draft plan for the cooperative's crop planting area and output, and handed it over to the production teams and members for discussion. The commune only controls the increased production targets for several major crops such as grain, cotton, and oil crops, while the specific arrangements for what crops to plant on which land and when to plant them are made by the production teams. On the principle of ensuring the completion of the tasks of handing over agricultural products to the state and the commune, the production team makes specific arrangements for the crops of the team, and has the flexibility to make slight adjustments and plant according to local conditions. If the members believe that the production team's crop arrangement cannot fully meet their needs, they can also use private plots and wasteland at the entrance of the village to supplement them. As a result, the cadres and members of each commune are very satisfied. They said: This is the only way to truly plant according to local conditions and increase production and income. According to the plans of 88 agricultural cooperatives in the county, the total grain output of the county will increase by 17.6% this year compared with last year, and the output of oil crops such as soybeans and peanuts needed by the state will increase by 41.5%. In order to better meet the needs of the members, each commune will also appropriately expand the planting area of sorghum and potatoes and the replanting area of summer crops. In this way, the raw materials for sideline production, firewood, fodder, and feed urgently needed by the members, as well as the raw materials for repairing houses and making their own utensils, can also be solved, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline production in the county can be increased by more than a quarter compared with last year.

    寿张县的农业社生产计划订得好
    既照顾到国家需要又照顾到社员需要
    新华社聊城20日电　山东省寿张县的农业社在制定今年生产计划时，合理地安排了国家和社、社和社员等方面的关系。
    寿张县的各级中共党组织和各社的驻社干部，在帮助农业社制定计划时，首先向社员讲解了国家和社、社和社员利益的一致性，并且指导各社采取和社员协商、统一安排的办法制定计划，合理的处理各方面的关系。如台前、景阳岗等乡的农业社，根据国家对农产品征购和采购的任务把社内的作物种植面积和产量做出计划草案，交给生产队和社员讨论，社内只掌握粮食、棉花、油料等几种主要作物的增产指标，至于那些地种什么作物，什么时间种，由生产队具体安排。生产队在保证完成上缴国家和社的农产品任务的原则下，对本队的作物进行具体安排，有稍加调整和因地种植的机动权。社员认为生产队的作物安排不能完全符合自己的需要时，还可以利用自留地和开村头荒地加以补充。这样作的结果，各社的社干部和社员都很满意，他们说：这才能真正因地种植，增产增收。据全县八十八个农业社的计划，今年这个县粮食总产量将比去年增产17.6％，国家需要的大豆、花生等油料作物的产量增加41.5％。为了更好地满足社员需要，各个社还将适当地扩大高粱、薯类的种植面积和夏季作物的复种面积。这样，社员们迫切需要的副业生产原料、烧柴、饲草、饲料以及修补房屋、自制用具等原料，也都可以得到解决，并且还可以使全县农、副业生产的总产值比去年增加四分之一多。
