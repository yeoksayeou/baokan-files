Irrigation with leveled land saves water and labor
Chen Jiongxin

Under the impetus of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the country newly developed 150 million mu of irrigated area last year, reaching more than 500 million mu including the previous areas. This has played a great role in increasing agricultural production. However, in some irrigated areas in the northern dryland areas (including newly developed irrigated areas), due to the failure to build field water conveyance ridges and ditches in time, and to carry out the necessary land leveling work, it has been difficult to introduce water into the fields; in some areas, due to the uneven land, irrigation has been uneven. All these hinder the full realization of irrigation benefits.

"Irrigation without leveling the land wastes water and labor"; "Digging wells without leveling the land wastes labor." This is the practical experience of the masses. Only on leveled land can reasonable irrigation be implemented to ensure good crop growth; and it can save water and improve irrigation efficiency. After the land of Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Gejia District, Wendeng County, Shandong Province, was leveled, under the same water conservancy equipment conditions, the irrigated area increased from 800 mu to 1,500 mu. After the land leveling and ridge construction work in the Xiaofu River Irrigation Area of Shandong Province, the water consumption per mu decreased by 40% to 50%, and the yield per unit area also increased by 10%.

How to do a good job in leveling the land? First of all, according to the development of irrigation facilities and the problems found in irrigation last year, a more comprehensive plan for land leveling should be made, combined with the entire agricultural production and labor situation, and arranged within the production plan of the agricultural cooperative. We must also strengthen technical guidance. The principle of leveling the land is not complicated, but it is not a simple matter to really do it well, quickly, and economically, especially in new irrigation areas lacking irrigation experience, which will encounter some specific technical difficulties. Leveling the land requires considering the terrain and landform, as well as the soil conditions; it is necessary to achieve a balance of earthwork by moving the high ground and filling the low ground, and to maintain soil fertility and meet irrigation requirements as much as possible; when leveling the land, it is necessary to combine it with cultivation and coordinate it with ridge construction and ditch digging. All these require technical guidance.

Under the current conditions, land leveling is mainly carried out in combination with farming. During plowing and harrowing, attention should be paid to the terrain and landform, consciously moving the high ground and filling the low ground to gradually level the land. For local mounds and highlands, adopt measures such as cutting the highlands and filling the lowlands, or combining with other uses of soil (such as taking soil to make adobe, paving cattle pens, etc.), to cut the soil from the highlands to achieve a consistent height. Generally speaking, the thickness of the topsoil that is cut at one time when leveling the land should not exceed 10 to 15 centimeters, in order to facilitate crop growth. Removing the subsoil and retaining the topsoil is also a way to preserve fertile soil, but it is more labor-intensive. While leveling the land, it is best to combine it with ridge construction, ditch digging, and other work, which saves labor and time. In addition, for wheat fields that have not been leveled and are difficult to irrigate, some necessary water conveyance ridges and ditches can be opened appropriately, and ridge dikes can be built in the wheat ridges without damaging the wheat seedlings, in order to expand the irrigated area of wheat.

Under the current conditions where we have not widely used machinery for land leveling, we should pay attention to summarizing, improving, and promoting land leveling tools created by the masses. The masses in many areas have made some creations and inventions in land leveling tools over the years, such as "plowshare scraper" and "serrated scraper," etc. These land leveling tools, which are modified from old-style farm tools, are labor-saving, money-saving, and have good results.

The spring plowing season is approaching, and spring farmland irrigation is about to begin. Arranging labor early, preparing land leveling tools, and actively leveling the land are among the very important tasks at present.

    灌溉先整地，省水又省力
    陈炯新
    在农业合作化高潮推动下，去年一年全国就新发展了灌溉面积一亿五千万亩，连前已达五亿亩以上，对农业增产起了很大作用。但是，在北方旱作的一些灌区（包括新发展的灌区），由于没有及时修筑田间输水垅沟，和进行必要的土地平整工作，引水入田就发生了困难；有的因土地高低不平，浇水不匀。这些都妨碍着灌溉效益的充分发挥。
    “灌溉不整地，费水又费力”；“打井不整地，白费劳动力”。这是群众的切身体验。只有在平整过的土地上才能实行合理灌溉，保证农作物生长良好；并且可以节约水量，提高浇地效率。山东文登县葛家区灯塔农业社，土地经过平整以后，在同样的水利设备条件下，浇地由八百亩提高到一千五百亩。山东孝妇河灌区经过平地打畦工作，每亩用水量减少40％到50％，单位面积的产量也提高了10％。
    如何做好平整土地的工作呢？首先应该根据灌溉设施发展的情况及去年在灌溉当中发现的问题，对土地平整工作进行一次比较全面的规划，结合整个农业生产及劳力情况，安排在农业社生产计划以内。还要加强技术指导。平整土地的道理并不复杂，但真正做到又多又好又快又省，还不是个简单的事，特别是缺乏浇地经验的新灌区，还会碰到一些技术上的具体困难。平整土地既要看地势地形，又要看土壤情况；既要做到移高垫低土方量的平衡，又要尽量保持土壤肥力和符合灌溉的要求；平地时既要与耕地结合，又要与筑畦挖沟协调。这些都需要进行技术指导。
    平整土地在当前条件下，主要是结合耕作进行，在翻耕耙地时，注意地势地形，有意识地移高垫低，逐步平整。对局部丘埠高地，采取铲切高地，填垫洼地或结合其他用土（如取土打坯、垫牛栏等），削取高地土壤，求得高低一致。一般说来在平地时一次铲切表土的厚度不宜超过十至十五公分，以利作物生长。移去底土保留表土也是保存肥土的办法，但比较费工。在平地的同时，最好结合筑畦挖沟等工作，这样省工省时。此外，对目前未经平整浇水困难的麦地，可适当开一些必要的输水垅沟，并在不损伤麦苗的情况下，在麦垅内修筑畦埂，以便扩大浇麦面积。
    在目前我们还没有广泛使用机械平地的条件下，应当注意总结、改良和推广群众创造出来的平地工具。许多地区的群众多年来对平地工具却有所创造发明，如“犁头刮土板”“狼牙刮土板”等，这些结合旧式农具改装而成的平地工具，省事省钱，效果也很好。
    春耕季节即将到来，春季农田灌溉就要开始，及早安排劳力，准备平地工具，积极进行土地平整，是当前很重要的工作之一。
