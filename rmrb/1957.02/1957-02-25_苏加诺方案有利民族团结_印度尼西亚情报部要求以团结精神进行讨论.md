Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 24th: The Indonesian Ministry of Information broadcast on the Indonesian radio program "Discussion of the President's Plan" on the evening of the 23rd, stating that President Sukarno's plan has been unanimously and warmly welcomed by all strata of Indonesian society.

The broadcast called on everyone to discuss the President's plan in a spirit of unity, with a "tolerant, serious, and calm attitude, avoiding actions that may cause an atmosphere of unrest."

The broadcast stated that the spirit of the President's plan is in line with the common ideal of the Indonesian people to achieve internal unity. At present, this unity is for overcoming the difficulties of the country and the nation, and secondly for the recovery of West Irian.

On the 23rd, Jakarta newspapers continued to comment on Sukarno's plan. An editorial in "Republic" believed that the National Council led by Sukarno himself, as mentioned in the plan, could form a driving force to enable the cabinet to more smoothly implement the task of completely eliminating colonialism and accelerating the establishment of a just and prosperous society.

"Republic" pointed out that as everyone is beginning to consider the President's plan, some aspects have apparently ignored the basic goal of the plan, which is to re-establish domestic peace to save the Republic of Indonesia. They are trying to entangle things in specific issues such as the entry of the Indonesian Communist Party into the cabinet and the allocation of seats in the National Council.

An editorial in "Indonesian News" stated that the President's plan is good, and if truly implemented, it could bring immense benefits to the Indonesian country and people. However, the newspaper also said that whether this plan can be fully realized must also take other factors into account.

The Masjumi Party's "Abadi Daily" believes that the unanimous support of all parties is an "absolute condition" for the implementation of the President's plan; otherwise, it will "not only not be a spirit of cooperation but will also cause division."

    苏加诺方案有利民族团结
    印度尼西亚情报部要求以团结精神进行讨论
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚情报部23日晚在印度尼西亚电台的“总统方案的讨论”节目中广播说，苏加诺总统的方案得到印度尼西亚各阶层一致热烈的欢迎。
    广播呼吁大家本着团结的精神，以“忍让、严肃而镇定的态度来讨论总统方案，避免那些可能引起骚乱气氛的行动”。
    广播说，总统方案的精神是符合于印度尼西亚人民实现内部团结的共同理想的。在目前，这种团结是为了克服国家和民族的困难，其次是为了收复西伊里安。
    23日，雅加达的报纸继续评论苏加诺的方案。“共和国报”社论认为，方案中提到的苏加诺本人领导的民族委员会，能够形成一股推动力量，促使内阁更顺利地执行彻底消灭殖民主义和加速建立一个公正而繁荣的社会的任务。
    “共和国报”指出，大家正在开始考虑总统方案的时候，某些方面显然已经忽略了方案的基本目标就是重新实现国内和平以拯救印度尼西亚共和国，他们力图把事情纠缠在印度尼西亚共产党入阁和民族委员会的席位分配等具体问题上。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”的社论说，总统方案是好的，如果真正加以执行，就能为印度尼西亚国家和人民带来莫大的好处。但是，这家报纸又说，能否彻底实现这个方案还必须估计到其他的因素。
    马斯友美党的“永恒日报”认为，各党的一致支持是实施总统方案的“绝对条件”，否则“不但不是合作精神而且将要引起分裂”。
