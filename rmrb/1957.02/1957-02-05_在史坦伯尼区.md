    In Stepney
          By Our Correspondent Su Lan
    Three hundred years ago, one of the largest hospitals in Europe was built in the east of London. This massive building was painted light green from top to bottom. It was surrounded by flowers, trees, and quiet fields. Only the waters of the Thames murmured gently beside it. At that time, it was an ideal sanatorium. However, as the years passed, "London Hospital" lost its youthful appearance. It never imagined that its soot-blackened body would now be located in the crowded and exceptionally noisy Stepney district.
    The development of capitalism suddenly made the Thames River important. The late nineteenth century was a time of massive shipbuilding and the continuous influx of workers to this area. It was also at this time that the wealthy of Stepney, "disdaining to associate with the poor," withdrew from this position. Most of them moved to Kensington and Bayswater.
    What remained were many clothing factories, breweries, and slaughterhouses. The fashionable clothes sewn by the workers and the delicious wine brewed were quickly sent to the luxury shops of West London to meet the needs of ladies and gentlemen. What was left for the residents of Stepney was the foul odor emanating from the slaughterhouses.
    Compared to West London, Stepney was a completely different world. The pavement of the streets was peeling off in pieces. The residential buildings, apart from some workers' dormitories built after the war, were mostly two-story buildings, which were much shorter than those in West London. The soot-blackened walls formed the monotonous color of Stepney. It is said that out of the entire district's three thousand four hundred and fifteen houses, because they were too old and unsafe, have been officially declared uninhabitable. One hundred families live in temporary wooden sheds. When these wooden sheds were erected, they were only expected to last for two years. However, people have lived here for ten years. Even if the houses above have collapsed, only the basement remains intact, people still live there.
    Squeezed into these houses of all sizes are dockworkers, garment workers, furniture workers... The entire Stepney district has a population of ninety-nine thousand. Most are workers and their families. Karl Marx's daughter, Eleanor, once led the workers' movement here. She organized gas workers and won an eight-hour workday. This gas workers' union was the first organization of non-technical workers in Britain. Later, it developed into a national municipal workers' union, becoming one of the largest unions in Britain.
    Of course, that was in the second half of the nineteenth century. There are not many people left who have experienced these struggles. However, older workers will tell you with great relish how, after the October Revolution, dockworkers held a massive strike, refusing to transport weapons onto ships, opposing armed intervention against Soviet Russia. Younger workers will proudly tell you how they fought against the fascists. That was in 1936, before the war, when the British fascist leader Mosley chose the Jewish-concentrated Stepney district to organize a parade of a military exercise nature. This action was tacitly approved by the then government, and a large number of police were mobilized to protect them. On the day the fascists mobilized, two hundred and fifty thousand workers in Stepney and other parts of East London piled obstacles on Cable Street, blocking their way. The fascists rushed over, and the workers beat them back. After a fierce battle, they finally repelled Mosley's troops.
    In such a district with a tradition of struggle, the Conservative Party can hardly expect to get the votes of the workers. In the first general election after the war in 1945, the workers of Stepney elected the Communist Party member Piratin as a Member of Parliament for the district. In the 1956 district council elections, four communists were elected. In this election, the Conservative candidates only received more than thirty votes in total.
    We visited some streets in the Stepney district. Noisy cafes and taverns are places for workers to relax and unwind. On the streets, you often come across black people, Malaysians, and Indians. It is said that there are more than twenty thousand Jews in this district. Among some old buildings, a large workers' dormitory built after the war suddenly appears. These were built by the city and district councils using government loans. These relatively clean and tidy dormitories are still in the minority. The living conditions of most people in Stepney are very poor. When entering a small alley behind Whitechapel Road, we smelled a pungent smoky smell, which was the residents burning garbage. Not far from it, three broken cars were parked on a wasteland. A stove was placed on the open space, and steam rose from the pot. Next to the car, several bamboo poles were erected, drying newly washed clothes. This is the "residence" of the Gypsies. Ruin after ruin constantly appeared on both sides of the street, this is the brand of the Second World War. The last bomb that fell here took the lives of one hundred and twenty people. Some of these ruins are covered with weeds, and some are piled with garbage. A British friend told me: "People want to clear these garbage, but no one is allowed to move it without the permission of the landowner."
    Walking south through a few small streets, you arrive at the ancient "London Docks" by the Thames. Here, dense cranes stand tall. The ships moored on the river spew thick black smoke, even covering the ground with a layer of coal ash. On the streets near the docks, you can occasionally see some workers sitting on the ground, drinking cheap coffee.
    In a basement, we visited a person in charge of the Tenants' Association on Turner Street. All the tenants on this street are organized. The houses they live in belong to "London Hospital." Not long ago, this association held a meeting, and the meeting made a resolution: each household donates three shillings, and this sum will be used as the association's activity expenses, such as litigation fees for fighting landlords and printing propaganda. It was also decided to send representatives to Parliament to petition against the passage of a bill to increase rents. Such organizations are very common in various streets of the Stepney district.
    Opposing rent increases has become an important struggle for the people of Stepney and the entire London.
    Low and dilapidated houses, ordinary and simple people, the appearance of the Stepney district is not very eye-catching. However, it contains endless power. From the generation of grandparents, the torch of struggle has been held high. They inherited it generation after generation, not letting the torch go out. (Attached picture)
    This is a market in East London abandoned by the wealthy people of West London. Compared with the markets in West London, the markets in East London appear particularly shabby and messy. However, for the impoverished customers who have no foothold in the bourgeois market, these simple stalls have become their arena.

    在史坦伯尼区
          本报记者　苏蓝
    三百年前，一座欧洲最大的医院在伦敦城的东部建立起来了。这座庞大的建筑物，从头到脚被粉刷成浅绿色。围绕着它的是花草、树木和静静的田野。只有泰晤士河的流水，在它的旁边发出轻微的响声。那时，这里是一个再理想不过的休养区了。可是，随着年代的消失，“伦敦医院”也失去了它那青春的面貌。当年，它万没有想到：现在它那被煤烟熏黑了的身躯，会座落在人口拥挤和异常嘈杂的史坦伯尼区。
    资本主义的发展，使得泰晤士河的地位突然重要起来。这条河，十九世纪末叶，是大量建造船坞和工人陆续向这里汇聚的年代。也就在这个时候，史坦伯尼区的富人“不屑与穷人为伍”，撤出了这块阵地。他们多半移到肯兴屯和贝斯渥特尔去。
    遗留下来的，是许多服装工厂、造酒厂和屠宰场。工人们缝制出来的摩登服装；酿造出来的美味酒，很快被送到西伦敦的豪华商店里去，供给太太和绅士们的需要。而给史坦伯尼居民留下的，是屠宰场散发出来的难闻的臭气。
    和西伦敦一比，史坦伯尼完全是另一个世界。街道的路面，一块块地剥落掉了。居民区的房屋，除了战后新建的一些工人宿舍以外，多半是两层的楼房，这比西伦敦的矮了一大半。被煤烟熏得发黑的墙壁，构成了史坦伯尼的单调的色彩。据说，全区有三千四百十五幢房屋，因为过于陈旧，不够安全，已经正式声明不能再住人了。有一百户人家，住在临时的木棚里。在支起这些木棚的时候，预计只能住两年。然而，人们在这里已经住了十年。甚至，上面的房屋已经倒塌，只有地下室是完整的，也还是照样住着人家。
    挤在这些大大小小房子里的，是码头工人，服装工人，家具工人……。史坦伯尼全区共有九万九千人。大部分是工人和他们的家属。马克思的女儿爱琳娜曾经在这里领导过工人运动。她组织了瓦斯工人，争得了八小时工作制。这个瓦斯工人的工会，是英国非技术工人的第一个组织。后来，就发展成全国性的市政工会，成为英国最大的工会之一。
    当然，那是十九世纪下半叶的事了。经历过这些斗争的人，已经不多了。不过，年老的工人会津津有味地告诉你：在十月革命之后，码头工人怎样举行大罢工，拒绝把武器搬运上船，反对对苏维埃俄罗斯的武装干涉。年轻一些的工人，又会自豪地告诉你：他们是怎样和法西斯分子进行斗争的。那是在战前的1936年，英国的法西斯头子莫斯莱选择了犹太人集中的史坦伯尼区，组织了一次军事演习性质的游行。这个行动，得到了当时政府的默许，并且动员了大批警察来保护他们。史坦伯尼和东伦敦其它地区的二十五万工人，在法西斯分子出动的那一天，把障碍物堆在电报街上，挡住了他们去路。法西斯分子冲过来，工人把他们打回去，经过激烈的搏斗，终于把莫斯莱的队伍打退了。
    在这样一个有斗争传统的区里，保守党当然很难指望得到工人的选票。1945年战后第一次大选时，史坦伯尼区的工人，把这个区里的共产党员皮拉丁选为议会议员。1956年区议员选举时，四个共产党员当选。在这一次选举中，保守党的候选人总共才得了三十多张选票。
    我们参观过史坦伯尼区的一些街道。噪杂的咖啡馆、小酒店，是工人们消遣休憩的场所。在街头，常常碰到黑人、马来亚人和印度人。据说，在这个区里，还有两万多犹太人。在一些古老的建筑物间，有时突然出现一大幢战后新建的工人宿舍。这是市、区议会用政府的贷款建筑的。这些比较干净整齐的宿舍还是少数。史坦伯尼大部分人的居住条件是十分恶劣的。当进入怀特恰珀尔路后面的一条小巷时，我们闻到了刺鼻的烟味，这是居民们在焚烧垃圾。离它不远的一个废墟上，停留着三辆破汽车。空地上放着一只炉子，锅里冒出热气。汽车旁边，支架起几根竹竿，晒着才洗过的衣服。这是吉卜赛人的“住宅”。街道两旁，还不断出现一个个的废墟，这是第二次世界大战的烙印。落在这里的最后一颗炸弹，夺去了一百二十个人的生命。这些废墟上，有的长着野草，有的堆满垃圾。一位英国朋友告诉我：“人们很想把这些垃圾清除一下，但是，在没有得到地皮所有者允许之前，是不准任何人动手的。”
    穿过几条小街往南走，就到了泰晤士河边的古老的“伦敦码头”了。这里，树立着密集的起重机。停在河上的轮船，喷出浓黑的烟雾。甚至把地面蒙上了一层煤灰。就在码头附近的街道上，偶而可以看到一些工人席地而坐，喝着便宜的咖啡。
    在一个地下室里，我们访问了特纳尔街房客协会的一个负责人。这条街上所有的房客都组织起来了。他们所住的房子，就是属于“伦敦医院”的。不久以前，这个协会开了一次会议，会议作出决议：每户捐出三先令，这笔款项将作为协会的活动费用，比如和房主斗争的诉讼费和印刷宣传品等。它还决定派出代表到议会去请愿，反对通过增加房租的法案。这样的组织，在史坦伯尼区的各个街道，是非常普遍的。
    反对增加租金，已经成为史坦伯尼和整个伦敦人民的一项重要斗争。
    低矮破旧的房屋，平凡朴实的人民，史坦伯尼区的外貌，是不大引人注意的。但是，在这儿却蕴藏着无穷无尽的力量。从祖父一辈起，就高举着斗争的火炬。他们一代代地继承下来，不让这火炬熄灭。（附图片）
    这是被西伦敦富人们所遗弃的东伦敦的一个市场。比起西伦敦的市场来，东伦敦的市场显得格外寒伧、杂乱。但是，在布尔乔亚市场上没有立足之地的贫困顾客，这些简陋的售货摊却成为他们活动的天地。
