Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th -- Many organizations, groups, factories, and enterprises in Shanghai are finding ways to save coal used for heating and cooking. According to a recent inspection by the Shanghai Coal Industry and Building Materials Company, more than 120 units have saved more than 4,000 tons of heating coal from December of last year to the present. If this coal were used for production, it could roll over 5,100 tons of steel.

These units generally save coal by shortening heating times, not using heating when the weather is not particularly cold, combining offices for heating, and improving coal burning methods. The Xuhui District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is entitled to 1,400 yuan for heating expenses in winter according to national standards, but they actually only used 500 yuan and plan to turn over the 900 yuan saved. The Hongkou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party originally wanted to add a batch of stoves, but after seeing the State Council's notice on saving coal, they did not buy the stoves. When the weather was cold, they burned small charcoal fires, saving 88% of their heating costs. The staff of the Shanghai Tenth Hospital's office have automatically stopped heating in the past few days and used the saved coal in the wards.

The cooks of various organizations and groups in Shanghai are also working hard to save coal for cooking. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions uses a stove specifically for boiling water to boil water and steam rice at the same time. They installed a pipe from this stove to the rice steamer, using steam to steam the rice, saving 90 jin of coal per day. The cooks of the East China Textile Engineering Institute launched a competition to reduce coal consumption, and the daily coal consumption is 400 jin less than in the past.

    上海许多单位节约用煤
    一百二十多个单位已节约四千多吨
    新华社上海15日电　上海市许多机关、团体、工厂、企业设法节约烤火和炊事用煤。据最近上海市的煤业建筑器材公司检查，有一百二十多个单位从去年12月到现在已经节约烤火煤四千多吨。如果把这些煤用到生产上，可以轧制五千一百多吨钢材。
    这些单位一般采取缩短取暖时间，天不特别冷不烤火，或合并办公烤火，改进烧煤方法等节约用煤。中共徐汇区委员会按照国家标准冬季可领用烤火费一千四百元，但他们实际上只用了五百元，准备将节省下的九百元上缴。中共虹口区委员会原想增添一批火炉，他们看到国务院节约煤炭的通知后，火炉也不买了，天气寒冷时，他们就烤小木炭火，节约了88％的烤火费用。上海市第十医院办公室的工作人员，在最近几天已经自动停止烤火，把节省下来的煤炭用到病房里去。
    上海各机关、团体的炊事人员还努力节约炊事用煤。上海市工会联合会把一个专门烧开水的炉子用来一面烧开水，一面蒸饭。他们从这种炉子上安上一根管子通到蒸饭箱，利用水蒸汽蒸饭，每天可节约九十斤煤炭。华东纺织工学院炊事人员开展了减少耗煤量的竞赛，每天的用煤量比过去减少四百市斤。
