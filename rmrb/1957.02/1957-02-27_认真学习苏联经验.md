    Conscientiously Study Soviet Experience
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The Changchun Metrology Instrument Factory has explored various methods to resolve the difficulty of insufficient steel supply.
    In the design of a 100-ton track scale, the engineering and technical personnel of this factory conscientiously studied Soviet design experience, changed the old design of the past, and reduced the steel and pig iron required for each track scale by two tons. Engineering and technical personnel and workers also promoted the experience of centralized blanking and plate nesting, estimating that 50 tons of steel can be saved throughout the year, solving the difficulty of insufficient steel this year.

    认真学习苏联经验
    本报讯　长春度量衡厂多方面想办法，解决钢材供应不足的困难。
    这个工厂在设计一百吨轨道衡的工作中，工程技术人员认真学习了苏联的设计经验，改变了过去的旧设计，使每台轨道衡所需的钢材和生铁各减少两吨。工程技术人员和工人们还推广了集中下料和板料套裁的经验，约计全年可以节省五十吨钢材，解决了今年钢材不足的困难。
