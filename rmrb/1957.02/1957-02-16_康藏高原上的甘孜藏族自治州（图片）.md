Kangding is the largest city in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, and it is the center of material exchange between the Tibetan and Han people. In recent years, with the smooth flow of the Kangzang Highway, the market in Kangding city has become more and more prosperous, and many new buildings have been built. To the southeast of the city is the Luding Iron Chain Bridge, where the Red Army displayed its heroic fighting spirit during the Long March.

In the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture on the Kangzang Plateau, the animal husbandry economy occupies an important position. There are many natural pastures here, where herds of cattle and sheep graze.

In recent years, the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province has trained many Tibetan women health workers. This is Zhima, a Tibetan nurse working in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture People's Hospital, taking a patient's temperature.

The smooth flow of the Kangzang Highway has brought prosperity to the Tibetan people.
