Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, Paris Dispatch: The Chairman of the Finance Committee of the French Republic's Senate, Mr. Bérenger, warned in a report to the Finance Committee on the 22nd that France's foreign exchange reserves used to pay for import trade may be exhausted by the end of this month. He said that in the second half of last year, France's trade deficit almost doubled, reaching as much as 40 billion francs per month. The increase in the deficit was due to a sharp decrease in French exports and an increase in imports of grain, raw materials, and industrial equipment. France's debt to the European Payments Union in January of this year was $70.5 million.

France's foreign exchange reserves have been greatly reduced. On December 31, 1955, foreign exchange reserves were 695 billion francs; according to Bérenger, on December 31, 1956, foreign exchange reserves had decreased to 100 billion francs.

The reporter emphasized that in the last three months, foreign exchange reserves have decreased by 47 billion francs per month. If this continues, foreign exchange reserves may be exhausted. Bérenger said that there is no question of using gold reserves at present, as the total gold reserves are only 394 tons, and this is the lifeblood of the franc.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, Paris Dispatch: French Finance Minister Ramadier announced on the 21st that the cabinet will take a number of emergency measures to cope with the current economic difficulties. These measures include: rejecting workers' demands for wage increases; intensifying the "buy only French goods" campaign; reducing imports of non-essential goods; reducing the amount of expensive imported coal, and importing cheap labor from Italy, Spain and other countries to increase French domestic coal production; borrowing from international organizations, and not devaluing the franc for the time being.

    法国贸易逆差激增　外汇储备濒于枯竭
    摩勒内阁将剜肉补疮应付经济难关
    新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：法国共和国参议院财政委员会主席贝朗克22日在财政委员会作报告时警告说，法国用来支付进口贸易的外汇可能在本月底用完。他说，去年下半年，法国的贸易逆差几乎增加了一倍，每月达四百亿法郎之多。逆差增加是由于法国的出口额大大减少，而粮食、原料、工业设备的进口额有所增加。法国在今年1月份对欧洲支付同盟所负的债务为七千零五十万美元。
    法国的外汇储备大大地减少了。在1955年12月31日，外汇储备有六千九百五十亿法郎；而据贝朗克说，1956年12月31日，外汇储备已减少到一千亿法郎。
    报告人着重指出，最近三个月中，外汇储备每月都减少四百七十亿法郎。照这样继续下去，外汇储备就可能用光。贝朗克说，现在根本谈不到使用黄金储备，黄金储备总共才有三百九十四吨，而这是法郎的命根子。
    新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：法国财政部长拉马第埃21日宣布说，内阁将采取若干紧急措施，应付目前的经济困难。这些措施中包括：拒绝工人增加工资的要求；加紧进行“只买法国货”运动，削减非必需品的进口；削减价格高昂的进口煤数量，从意大利、西班牙等国输入廉价劳动力来提高法本国煤的产量；向国际组织借款，法郎暂不贬值。
