Narcissus	Yang Qi
During the Spring Festival, placing a pot of narcissus in the room, with its beautiful posture and overflowing fragrance, adds a lot of charm.

The cultivation of narcissus is famous in the area of Meixi and Tianzhongyang, located at the foot of Yuanshan Mountain in Zhangzhou, Fujian, where the evening glow reaches, covering no more than seven or eight *li* in length and width. According to the planting experience of flower farmers, narcissus cannot be planted in areas far from Yuanshan Mountain. It turns out that the area reached by the evening glow of Yuanshan Mountain has more moisture, a mild climate, and fertile soil, and the eastern foot even has warm veins, so even in the severe cold, it is warmer, which is suitable for planting narcissus.

Regarding narcissus, there is a thought-provoking legend in the producing area:

A long time ago, at the foot of Yuanshan Mountain lived an old widow who depended on her son to farm the land. One day, as the sun was setting, the old widow bought a bowl of rice to wait for her son to come back and eat. At this time, a beggar came to the old woman to beg for food. The old widow saw that the beggar was hungry and weak, and looked pitiful, so she gave him the only bowl of rice she had. After the beggar finished eating, the old widow suddenly cried sadly. The beggar asked her, "Old woman, why are you crying?" The widow said, "This bowl of rice was originally for my son to eat." The beggar asked, "Are you reluctant?" The widow said, "No, giving the rice to you can save your life; leaving it for my son to eat would only fill his stomach." Upon hearing this, the beggar asked the old woman, "Where is your field?" The old woman pointed to the front and said, "It's at the foot of that Yuanshan Mountain." The beggar ran forward, went to her field, spat out the rice he had just eaten, and turned around and jumped into the pond beside the field.

The old widow chased after him, shouting for help. Her son and the villagers heard the noise and rushed to the scene, jumping into the pond to rescue him. But after searching for a long time, they couldn't find the beggar's body. The next day, everyone went to search again, but they saw that the rice grains in the field had turned into a strange flower, fragrant and beautiful. Everyone discussed it and said that this beggar must be a water sprite (水仙, Shuǐxiān, literally "water immortal"), so they called this strange flower "narcissus".

This legend reflects that the narcissus is a product of people's sincerity and friendship. Over the past five hundred years, through people's meticulous cultivation, it has been cultivated to be even more beautiful.

According to old flower farmers, the original narcissus was very rough, with small flower heads and many small bulbs growing next to it, like monkey heads and rat ears, which were unsightly. Because the flower heads were small, the flowers that bloomed were also few. Usually, a single flower head could only bloom two or three branches of flowers, and the larger flower heads could only bloom three or four branches at most. Each branch of flower had only three or four blossoms, so a single flower head could bloom no more than twenty blossoms.

Over the centuries, flower farmers have continuously improved the cultivation of narcissus. First of all, they tried to limit the tillering of the narcissus so that the flower heads rarely grew small nodules. Therefore, they created a method of castration, using a small knife to castrate the tillering part of the seeds before planting, so that the growing flower heads only grow one or two small nodules on both sides, like two ears. This is not only beautiful, but also because there are fewer nodules, the flower head is large and plump, and the flowers bloom more abundantly. Usually, a single flower head can grow seven or eight branches of flowers, and each branch can bloom ten blossoms; a large flower head can bloom up to twenty-four branches of flowers, with one or two hundred blossoms.

The narcissus that we commonly see now has two types: "Golden Cup Silver Stand" and "Jade Exquisite". "Golden Cup Silver Stand," commonly known as "goblet-shaped," is a single-petal narcissus with a bluish-white corolla, yellow sepals, and a yellow corona in the center, shaped like a goblet, hence the name "Golden Cup Silver Stand." "Jade Exquisite," commonly known as "hundred-petal-shaped," is a double-petal narcissus with petals rolled into a cluster, the corolla light yellow with white at the base, without a distinct corona, which is more beautiful than the single-petal narcissus, but the fragrance is somewhat lacking.

Narcissus, after the carving of florists, can also grow into various beautiful shapes as desired. The florists of Zhangzhou are good at carving it into Buddha's hands and crabs; the florists of Guangdong can even carve it into ancient shapes such as double happiness symbols, which are very beautiful.

After carving the flower head, it is nourished with clean water in an elegant porcelain pot, with some small pebbles or large gravel placed in the pot. After a few days, green leaves will grow, and in twenty or thirty days, it will bloom. If you want it to bloom early, you can place the flower pot in a sunny place indoors and change the water frequently with warm water, and the flowers will bloom early. During the day, put it in a shady place, and at night, let it be exposed to dew, so that the flowering time can be slowed down. Florists can cultivate the flower head to bloom on the ideal days according to the climate and flower development, such as cultivating "Christmas flowers," "New Year's Day flowers," and "Lantern Festival flowers."

Flower farmers in the producing area of narcissus like to cultivate a pot of narcissus that is about to bloom on New Year's Eve, offering it in the hall. The whole family gathers around the stove to drink wine and admire the flowers, watching the flowers slowly bloom and smelling the fragrance, which adds to the joy of the New Year's Eve.

    水仙	杨启
    新春，室里摆一盆水仙花，姿态妍秀，清香四溢，给人增添不少情趣。
    水仙花的栽培，在福建漳州园山东麓夕影所及的梅溪、田中央等地，纵横不过七、八里，出产有名的水仙花。据花农的栽种经验，距离园山较远的地区就不能栽种。原来园山夕影所及地带，水分较多，气候温和，土壤肥沃，而东麓更有温脉，虽在严寒，也较温暖，宜栽水仙花。
    关于水仙花，在产地一带有着一个耐人寻味的传说：
    很早以前，园山脚下住着一个老寡妇，靠儿子耕田度日。有一天，太阳西斜了，老寡妇买了一碗饭等待儿子回来吃。这时有一个乞丐走来向老妇人求乞。老寡妇见乞丐又饥又饿，形状可怜，便把仅有的一碗饭送给他吃。乞丐吃完了饭，老寡妇忽然伤心地哭起来。乞丐问她：“老婆婆，为什么哭呢？”寡妇说：“我这碗饭，原是留给儿子吃的。”乞丐问：“舍不得吗？”寡妇说：“不，饭施给你吃，可以救你一条性命；留给我儿子吃，不过只是一饱吧了。”乞丐听了，便问老妇人道：“你的田地在那里？”老妇人指着前面说：“就在那园山脚。”乞丐奔走前去，到她的田地上吐出刚才所吃的饭，转身跳入田边的池塘中。
    老寡妇从后面追来，大喊救人。她的儿子和村里人闻声赶到，跳入池塘捞救。但打捞许久，都找不到乞丐的尸体。第二天，大家又去打捞，却看见田里的饭粒变成了一朵奇异的花来，又香又美，大家纷纷议论，说这个乞丐一定是个水仙，就把这朵奇异的花叫做“水仙花”。
    这个传说，反映了水仙花是人们真诚友爱的产物。五百多年来，经过人们的细意栽培，已把它培养得更加美丽了。
    据老花农说，原先的水仙花很粗糙，花头小，旁边附生着很多小球茎，似猴头鼠耳，状不雅观。由于花头小，开的花也少，普通一颗花头只能开二、三枝花，大一些的花头最多也只能开三、四枝花，每枝花的花朵只有三、四朵，这样，一颗花头最多开花不上二十朵。
    几百年来，花农不断的把水仙花的培植加以改进。首先，想办法限制水仙花的分蘖，使花头很少生小瘤，于是创造出阉刈的办法来，把种子在播种前用小刀阉刈去分蘖的部分，使生长起来的花头只在两旁生长一、二个小瘤，好像两只耳朵。不但美观，而且由于小瘤少，花头肥大，花就开得多，普通一颗花头能长出七、八枝花，而每枝花可开十朵；大的一颗花头开到二十四枝花，能开出一、二百朵花来。
    我们现在常见的水仙花，有“金盏银台”和“玉玲珑”两种。“金盏银台”俗名“酒杯形”，是一种单瓣的水仙花，花冠色青白，黄萼，中套黄色附冠，形如盏形，故名“金盏银台”。“玉玲珑”俗名“百叶形”，是一种复瓣的水仙花，余十花瓣片卷成一簇，花冠下轻黄带白，无明显附冠，较单瓣水仙花美观，但香味差一些。
    水仙花，经过花匠的雕刻，还可随心所欲，长出各种美丽的形态。漳州的花匠善于把它雕成佛手和螃蟹；广东的花匠更可把它雕成双喜等古老形态，很是美观。
    雕刻后的花头，用清水养在雅致的瓷盆里，盆内放些小石卵或大粒砂砾，几天后就长出绿叶，二、三十天就可开花，假如要它早开花，可把花盆放在屋内朝阳地方，并多换温水，花就开得早。白天把它放在日荫的地方，晚上让它冻露水，这样花开的时间就可慢些。花匠根据气候和花发育情况，能把花头培养在理想的日子里开花。如养出“圣诞花”、“初一花”、“元宵花”等。
    水仙花产地的花农都喜欢培养一盆除夕含苞欲放的水仙花，供奉在大厅里，一家人“围炉”吃酒赏花，看花儿慢慢开放，闻花儿发射清香，这给欢乐的年夜确也增添不少兴致。（附图片）
