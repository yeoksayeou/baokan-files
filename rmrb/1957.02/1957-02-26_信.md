    Letter
    Soviet Union Yuli Yakovlev

    We received a letter from China, after a long and distant journey. We gently opened the letter, the unfamiliar address filling us with joy and surprise. This sudden arrival of a letter brought happiness, it came from our brothers in Xinjiang. But inside the letter, we found only a small handful of seeds, securely wrapped in thick paper. Comrades stood around the letter, wondering how to interpret it. My friend said, "Only the earth can truly understand these words." We divided the ground into rows and ridges, working all day until the sun set over the hills, scattering these interesting words - seeds - onto the beloved earth. Sprinklers watered them like gentle rain, the seeds absorbing the warm sunlight. We bent low the poplar trees, waiting for this letter to speak. Before we knew it, several days had passed, and the seeds had grown in the earth. Those adorable little seedlings, green and lush, lined up on the ridges. On the fresh leaves shimmered the colors of apricot red, turquoise, and azure blue. Ah, we understand every word now, it is mallow, the fragrance of sesame trees. Silvery tobacco leaves glittered brightly, as pure and cool as winter, this is a letter of blooming flowers, from distant Xinjiang in China. Our people have their own language and writing, but we understand without translation, the feeling of friendship is a tremendous power.

    信
    苏联　尤利·亚柯夫列夫我们收到一封中国的来信，它经过了遥远漫长的地方。我们轻轻地把信儿打开，这陌生的地址使我们又欢喜又
  惊荒。这突然飞来的信叫人欢畅，它来自我们的兄弟——新疆但信里只找到一小把种籽，牢固地包在厚实的信纸上。伙伴们围着信儿站在一旁，这封信啊，应该怎样来猜想？我的朋友说：“这些字儿啊只有大地能够清楚地知详。”我们在地上分成垅和行，整天地劳动到日落山岗把这些有趣的字——种籽，撒在亲爱的土地上。喷壶像小雨般地浇水，种籽吸着温暖的阳光。把那杨树弄得弯又低，等待着这信儿把话讲。不知不觉过了好几天，种籽在大地里已成长。那可爱的小嫩苗叶啊，绿油油地排列在垅上。在新鲜的叶儿上闪耀着杏红、绿松石、天蓝色的光。啊，每个字我们都懂了，是锦葵，是香油树的芬芳。银色的烟叶晶晶闪着亮，宛如冬天一样洁白清凉，这是开着鲜花的信纸，来自遥远的中国新疆。让我们的人民有自己的语言和文字，我们不用翻译已明白，友谊的感觉是莫大力量。
