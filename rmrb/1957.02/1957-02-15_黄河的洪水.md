    The Floods of the Yellow River
    Ye Yongyi
    The Yellow River is China's second largest river, possessing extremely rich water resources. However, the flood disasters of the Yellow River are also extremely serious. For thousands of years, it has brought endless disasters to the people on both sides of the lower reaches, so much so that it is called "China's scourge."
    Now, our country is vigorously building the Sanmenxia Reservoir to control and develop the Yellow River. In order to eliminate harm and promote benefits, we must understand the characteristics of the Yellow River floods.
    The Yellow River floods have four flood seasons in a year: "Peach, Midsummer, Autumn, and Ice." Every year at the end of March and the beginning of April, when the peach blossoms are in bloom, large amounts of ice melt in the river between Yinchuan, Baotou, and the area around the bends of the Yellow River. This water flows downstream and forms a small flood, so it is called the "Peach Flood." During the summer and autumn rainy seasons, there are often heavy rainstorms, and the river water often rises sharply. This is the "Midsummer Flood" and the "Autumn Flood." In the cold winter or when the spring thaw occurs, many ice floes drift downstream with the current. They often become blocked in curved and narrow river sections, thereby raising the water level and causing overflows. This is called the "Ice Flood."
    Among the four flood seasons, the Peach Flood generally does not cause disasters. The Ice Flood often causes overflows in the Hetao area and Shandong province. Although the scope is not large, it is still worth noting. Since Liberation, there have been two Ice Floods that caused disasters in Shandong province. The Midsummer Flood and the Autumn Flood often cause serious disasters in the North China Plain in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, posing the greatest threat. The Yellow River floods we usually refer to are these.
    The characteristics of floods in different sections of the Yellow River are different. The floods that threaten the lower reaches of the Yellow River mainly originate from the area below Hekou Town (130 kilometers downstream of Baotou).
    The Yellow River basin above Lanzhou is located on the Gansu-Qinghai Plateau. The intensity of rainstorms there is not high, and there are also some lakes, swamps, grasslands, and forests scattered throughout, which have a good ability to regulate water flow. Therefore, although this area has an area of ​​240,000 square kilometers, the floods are not large. In 1946, the year with the largest recorded flood, the amount of water flowing per second (called the peak flow) was only 5,900 cubic meters when the flood reached its peak. The rise and fall of the Yellow River floods in the Lanzhou area are also relatively gentle, gradually rising and slowly falling, often lasting for one to two months.
    From Lanzhou to Hekou Town, although the basin area increases by 140,000 square kilometers, most of the area passed through is arid plain, and many canals draw water from the Yellow River for irrigation, with few tributaries joining. The river channel in this section is wide and the flow is gentle. When upstream floods pass through the river channel, they are stored and slowed down, reducing the peak flow and lengthening the duration of the flood.
    Below Hekou Town, the Yellow River enters a canyon section. Both sides are loess hills and stone mountains with steep slopes, and many tributaries converge. In summer and autumn, there are also strong rainstorms here. After each rain, thousands of gullies and valleys rise simultaneously, and water and mud rush down together. Often, the Yellow River water level can rise by more than ten feet in a single day and night. Therefore, the peak flow at Longmen can often reach more than 10,000 cubic meters per second. This section of the Yellow River flood has the characteristics of a mountain flood, rising rapidly and falling quickly. A single flood lasts less than two or three days, but several floods can occur in a month. This is completely different from the nature of the Yellow River floods in the sections above Hekou Town.
    Below Longmen, at Tongguan, the Jing, Luo, Wei, and Fen rivers converge. The Fen River basin has a basin in the middle, so the floods in its lower reaches are not large. However, the Jing, Luo, and Wei rivers are as fierce in their floods as the canyon section above Longmen. Therefore, if the Jing, Luo, and Wei areas and the Shanxi-Shaanxi canyon section experience floods simultaneously, their confluence will cause a major flood in the lower reaches. The great flood of 1933 was caused in this way.
    Below Tongguan, the Yellow River flows through Shanxian and Sanmenxia to Zhengzhou. In this section, two large tributaries, the Yi River, Luo River (Henan), and Qin River, flow in. This section of the area also often experiences larger floods, threatening the safety of the Yellow River's downstream dikes. The flood disaster of 1935 was caused in this way.
    This shows that the floods that threaten the lower reaches of the Yellow River mainly originate from the above three areas: the Shanxi-Shaanxi canyon, the Jing, Luo, and Wei rivers, and the Yi, Luo, and Qin rivers. To eliminate the Yellow River's water damage, it is necessary to control the floods in these three areas. If flood control reservoirs are built, it is best to build them below the Yi, Luo, and Qin rivers' entrance and above Zhengzhou. In this way, the floods of the entire river can be intercepted, completely controlling the source of water disasters. Unfortunately, there is no suitable dam site here, so it was necessary to move upstream to Sanmenxia to build the dam. The Sanmenxia Reservoir can control the two flood sources above Tongguan, but it cannot control the floods of the Yi, Luo, and Qin rivers downstream. This is why, in addition to the Sanmenxia Reservoir, reservoirs must also be built on these two tributaries.
    In order to design the flood control capacity of the reservoir, we also need to know the size of the floods. The size of the floods in each river varies from year to year. The Yellow River Shanxian hydrological station (22 kilometers upstream of Sanmenxia) recorded that in the smallest flood of 1924, the peak flow was only 3,200 cubic meters per second, while in the largest flood of 1933, it reached 18,500 cubic meters per second. From investigations, we also know that a very large flood occurred in the Yellow River in 1843 (the 23rd year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty). The residents along the river still circulate a folk song: "In the twenty-third year of Daoguang, the Yellow River rose to the sky, washed away Taiyang Ferry, and took Wanjin Shoal with it" (Note: Both of these are place names along the river in Shanxian). According to flood traces, the peak flow in that year was estimated to be about 36,000 cubic meters per second.
    Since the size of the Yellow River floods varies from year to year, what size of flood should we use as our defense target when building flood control projects? Obviously, we cannot only use the largest flood in the record as the design standard, because even larger floods may be encountered after many years. Therefore, we must calculate even rarer floods. Over the years, engineers have come up with some mathematical and statistical methods to use existing records to estimate the size of floods of various frequencies. For example, floods that occur once in a century or once in a millennium. Then, depending on the importance of the project, a flood of a certain frequency is selected as the design standard. Because the Sanmenxia Reservoir is a large project and is related to the lives and property safety of millions of people, a relatively rare flood that occurs once in a millennium was selected as the design standard.
    In addition to the peak flow of the flood, we also need to know the total amount of floodwater that has flowed in certain days when using reservoirs to regulate floods. The larger the total amount of floodwater, the larger the reservoir capacity required for regulation. The largest 30-day floodwater volume recorded at the Yellow River in Shanxian was 15.8 billion cubic meters, and the estimated 30-day floodwater volume for a flood that occurs once in a millennium is 22 billion cubic meters. The flood control capacity required for the Sanmenxia Reservoir is designed based on this.
    Compared with some rivers in the south, the floods of the Yellow River are relatively small. For example, the Han River basin above Xiangyang has an area of ​​only 100,600 square kilometers, which is only one-sixth of the basin area above the Yellow River's Shanxian. However, the largest recorded peak flow once reached 52,000 cubic meters per second, and the 30-day floodwater volume once reached 26.9 billion cubic meters, both exceeding the amount of the Yellow River's flood that occurs once in a millennium. So why are the flood disasters of the Yellow River more serious than other rivers? This is mainly due to the Yellow River's sediment problem. The Yellow River carries a large amount of sediment in its floods. When this sediment reaches the North China Plain, some of it settles down due to the slower water flow. Over time, the riverbed gradually silts up, and the dikes have to be raised accordingly, resulting in the situation where the Yellow River riverbed is higher than the surrounding plains today. Due to sediment deposition in the riverbed, the water flow often changes position, pushing against the banks and causing breaches. Once a breach occurs, the water flows down from a high place and never returns, forming a change in course. Therefore, the ancients summarized the river characteristics of the lower reaches of the Yellow River as "prone to siltation, prone to shifting, and prone to breaching." To fundamentally control the Yellow River's water damage today, in addition to building reservoirs and reinforcing dikes, we must also carry out large-scale soil and water conservation work in the loess area to eliminate the source of sediment. At the same time, soil and water conservation measures will also weaken the ferocity of the floods. After the construction of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, in order to prevent the reservoir from silting up quickly and maintain its function, this work must be accelerated.
    Although we now have a relatively detailed understanding of the Yellow River floods, we will encounter a series of new problems in the operation of the Sanmenxia Reservoir. For example, in order to better leverage the reservoir's flood control function, when heavy rainstorms occur upstream, we must forecast the size of the flood so that we can empty part of the reservoir in advance to prepare for intercepting the flood. When heavy rainstorms occur in the area below Sanmenxia, we must also reduce the water flow released from the reservoir based on forecasts to prevent it from harming downstream dikes. As soil and water conservation measures develop year by year, we must also estimate their effect on reducing floods. These all require continued research by China's hydrological workers.
    When the Yellow River floods are controlled, we will be able to utilize the Yellow River's abundant water resources: the 26 million kilowatts of power generation capacity contained in the entire river will be gradually developed, hundreds of millions of mu of land will gradually be irrigated, and the navigation of various sections of the Yellow River will also be improved. In the future, what we will see in the Yellow River will not be rolling turbid waves, but clear water and green waves. It will no longer be "China's scourge," but will become a source of happiness for the Chinese people.

    黄河的洪水
    叶永毅
    黄河是我国的第二大河，蕴藏着十分丰富的水利资源。可是黄河的洪水灾害也是十分严重的，千百年来它给下游两岸人民带来无穷的灾难，以致被称为“中国的祸患”。
    现在，我们的国家正在大力修建三门峡水库，用以制服和开发黄河。为了除害兴利，我们必须了解黄河洪水的特性。
    黄河洪水在一年中有“桃、伏、秋、凌”四汛，每年三月底四月初，桃花开放的时候，银川、包头之间和前后河套一带，河里的大量冰块融化，这些水流到下游就形成一次小洪水，所以称为“桃汛”。夏秋雨季多有暴雨，河水常常陡涨，这是“伏汛”和“秋汛”。寒冬季节或是春暖解冻的时候，许多凌块随着水流漂浮而下，在弯曲而狭窄的河段常会阻塞，因而抬高水位，引起漫溢，这叫“凌汛”。
    四汛之中，桃汛一般不引起灾害。凌汛常在河套和山东境内造成漫溢，虽然范围不大，却也值得注意。解放以来，就曾经有两次凌汛在山东境内造成灾害。伏汛和秋汛常在黄河下游华北平原造成严重的灾害，威胁最大。我们平常所说的黄河洪水就是指此而言。
    黄河各段洪水的性格是不同的。威胁黄河下游的洪水主要来自河口镇（在包头下游一百三十公里）以下的地区。
    兰州以上的黄河流域，位于甘、青高原，那里暴雨的强度不大，并且还散布着一些湖泊、沼泽、草地和森林，具有很好的调节水流的能力，因此这个地区虽有二十四万平方公里的面积，而洪水并不大。纪录中洪水最大的1946年，当洪水涨到最高峰时，每秒钟流过的水量（称为洪峰流量）才五千九百公方。兰州一带黄河洪水的涨落也比较平缓，逐渐上涨，缓缓下落，前后历时常达一、二个月。
    由兰州到河口镇，虽然流域面积增加十四万平方公里，但所经地区大部为干旱的平原，有很多渠道从黄河引水灌溉，而很少支流加入。这一段河道的河槽宽阔，流势平缓，上游洪水经过河道时停蓄荡漾，洪峰流量降低，洪水延续时间也加长。
    河口镇以下，黄河流入峡谷河段，两岸都是黄土的丘陵和石山，坡度陡峻，有许多支流汇入。夏秋季这里又多强烈的暴雨，每次雨后，千沟万壑同时涨水，连水带泥奔泻而下，往往一昼夜之间黄河水位可以猛涨一丈多，因此龙门的洪峰流量常可以达到一万秒公方以上。这一段黄河洪水具有山洪性质，涨的猛落的快，一次洪水不到两三天，但一月之中常可以发生几次洪水，前峰未落而后峰又到，同河口镇以上各段黄河洪水的性质迥然不同。
    龙门以下到了潼关，又有泾、洛、渭、汾诸河汇入。汾河流域中间为一片盆地，所以它下游的洪水不大。而泾、洛、渭各河洪水的凶猛，有似龙门以上的峡谷河段。所以若泾、洛、渭地区和山陕峡谷河段同时发生洪水，汇合以后就会引起下游的大水灾，1933年的大水就是这样造成的。
    潼关以下，黄河流经陕县和三门峡再到郑州，这一段又有两条大支流——伊河、洛河（河南）和沁河注入。这一段地区也时常发生较大的洪水，威胁黄河下游堤防的安全。1935年的水灾就是因为这样造成的。
    这就可以看到，威胁黄河下游的洪水主要发源于上述三个地区——山陕峡谷，泾、洛、渭和伊、洛、沁。要消除黄河水害，必须控制这三个地区的洪水。如果修建防洪水库，最好是修建在伊、洛、沁河入口以下郑州以上的地方，这样就能拦蓄全河的洪水，完全控制水灾的来源。可惜这里没有适当的坝址，因此不得不向上移到三门峡去筑坝。三门峡水库可以控制潼关以上的两个洪水来源地，却无法控制它下游的伊、洛、沁河的洪水。这也就是为什么除了三门峡水库以外，还得在这两条支流上修建水库的原因。
    为了设计水库的防洪库容，还要知道洪水的大小。每条河流各年洪水的大小是不同的。黄河陕县水文站（在三门峡上游二十二公里）在三十五年的纪录中，洪水最小的1924年洪峰流量只三千二百秒公方，而在洪水最大的1933年却达到一万八千五百秒公方。从调查中我们还知道在1843年（清道光23年）黄河还发生过一次非常大的洪水，沿河一带的居民到现在还流传着一首民谣：“道光二十三，黄河涨上天，冲走太阳渡，捎带万锦滩”（注：这两处都是陕县沿河地名）。根据洪水痕迹推算，当年的洪峰流量约为三万六千秒公方。
    既然黄河洪水的大小年年不同，那么我们修建防洪工程应当以多大的洪水作为我们的防御对象呢？显而易见，我们不能只以纪录中的最大洪水作为设计标准，因为再过多少年可能会碰到更大的洪水，因此就要计算更为少见的洪水。若干年来工程师们想了一些数理统计方法，利用已有的纪录推算各种频率的洪水的大小。例如百年一遇的、千年一遇的洪水，然后视工程的重要性选择某一频率的洪水，作为设计标准。三门峡水库由于工程很大，又关系到千百万人民的生命财产安全，因此就选用了比较少见的千年一遇的洪水作为设计标准。
    利用水库来调节洪水，除了洪水最高峰的流量以外，我们还要知道在某些天内一共流过的洪水总量。洪水总量大的也就需要更大的水库容积来调节。黄河在陕县纪录中最大的三十天的洪水量为一百五十八亿公方，推算千年一遇洪水的三十天的洪水量为二百二十亿公方。三门峡水库所需要的防洪库容就是以这为根据设计的。
    黄河的洪水和南方的一些河流相比是较小的。例如汉水流域在襄阳以上，面积只有十万零六千平方公里，仅为黄河陕县以上流域面积的六分之一，而纪录中的最大洪峰流量却曾经达到五万二千秒公方，三十天的洪水量曾达到二百六十九亿公方，都超过黄河的千年一遇的洪水的数量。那么为什么黄河的洪水灾害会比其他河流严重呢？这主要是由于黄河的泥沙问题。黄河在洪水中带有大量的泥沙，这些泥沙一到华北平原，由于水流变缓就有一部分沉淀下来，日积月累河床就逐渐淤高，而堤防也就不得不随着加高，以至形成今天黄河河床高于两岸平地的局面。由于河床中泥沙淤淀，水流就时常改变位置，顶冲堤岸引起决口。而一旦决口，水流由高而下一去不回，就形成了改道。所以古人把黄河下游的河性总结为“善淤、善徙、善决”三点，而我们今天要根治黄河水害，除了兴修水库，加固堤防以外，还得在黄土区域大规模进行水土保持工作，以消除泥沙的来源。同时，水土保持措施也会削弱洪水的凶势。在三门峡水库修建以后，为了不使水库很快淤死而维持其作用，更要加快这项工作。
    虽然现在我们对黄河的洪水已经有了比较详细的了解，但在三门峡水库的运用中还会碰到一系列新的问题。例如为了更好地发挥水库的防洪作用，当上游发生暴雨，我们就必须预报洪水的大小，以便把水库事先放空一部分准备拦蓄洪水；当三门峡以下地区发生暴雨的时候，我们也要根据预告减少水库下泄的水流量，使不至为害下游堤防。当水土保持措施逐年发展以后，我们还要推算它对减少洪水的作用。这些都有待于中国的水文工作者继续研究。
    当黄河洪水被控制以后，我们就有可能来利用黄河的丰富的水利资源：全河蕴藏的二千六百万瓩的发电能力将要被逐步开发，一亿几千万亩的土地也将逐渐得到灌溉，黄河各段的航运也将会得到改善。将来，我们在黄河里看到的不是滚滚浊浪，而是碧水绿波。它将不再是“中国的祸患”，而将成为中国人民幸福的源泉。
