    The Gulf of Aqaba is located in the northern part of the Red Sea, between the Arabian Peninsula and the Sinai Peninsula. Its coastline passes through four countries: Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. At the southern end of the Gulf of Aqaba and the Sinai Peninsula, there are two small islands called Tiran Island and Sanafir Island, which control the gateway from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Red Sea. At the northernmost end of the Gulf of Aqaba is a Jordanian port, Aqaba.

    In 1948, under the instigation of imperialism, war broke out between Egypt and Israel. In 1949, although the two countries signed an armistice agreement, the dispute between them was not resolved. In January 1954, in order to strengthen the blockade of Israel, the Egyptian government announced that it would expand the scope of the blockade from the Suez Canal to the Gulf of Aqaba. In 1956, after the defeat of the Anglo-French and Israeli aggression against Egypt, the Israeli invading forces still occupied the Gaza Strip of Egypt and a narrow strip of land along the Gulf of Aqaba from Taba to Sharm el-Sheikh, as well as islands such as Tiran. One of the conditions for the withdrawal of Israeli troops proposed to Egypt was that Egypt "guarantee" Israel's "freedom of navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba. Israel attempted to confuse the issue of the withdrawal of invading troops from Egypt with the historical disputes between Egypt and Israel.

    On the issue of Israel's withdrawal from Egypt, the United States sided with Israel and put pressure on Egypt. The United States wanted to use United Nations forces to occupy the Gaza Strip for a long time, and believed that the Gulf of Aqaba was an "international waterway," guaranteeing that after Israel withdrew from Egypt, its ships could pass through the Gulf of Aqaba. This approach by the United States was actually to force Egypt to accept Israel's withdrawal conditions, to undermine the Egyptian people's will to fight for national independence, in order to facilitate its implementation of the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggression plan in the Middle East.

    亚喀巴湾
    亚喀巴湾位于红海的北部、阿拉伯半岛和西奈半岛之间。它的海岸线经过埃及、以色列、约旦和沙特阿拉伯等四国。在亚喀巴湾和西奈半岛的南端，有两个小岛叫蒂朗岛和塞纳菲尔岛，它们控制着亚喀巴湾进入红海的大门。亚喀巴湾的最北端有一个约旦的港口——亚喀巴。
    1948年，在帝国主义的挑拨下，以埃两国发生战争。1949年，两国虽然签订了停战协定，但它们之间的纠纷并没有解决。1954年1月，埃及政府为了加强对以色列的封锁，宣布把封锁范围从苏伊士运河扩大到亚喀巴湾。1956年，英法和以色列侵略埃及战争失败后，以色列侵略军仍然占领着埃及的加沙地带和亚喀巴湾沿岸从塔巴到沙姆沙伊赫之间的一条狭长地带以及蒂朗等岛屿。以色列向埃及提出的撤军条件之一，就是要埃及“保证”以色列在亚喀巴湾的“航行自由”。以色列企图把从埃及撤退侵略军问题同以埃之间的历史纠纷混为一谈。
    在以色列从埃及撤军问题上，美国站在以色列一边，向埃及施加压力。美国想用联合国部队长期占领加沙地带，并认为亚喀巴湾是一条“国际水道”，保证以色列从埃及撤军之后，它的船只可以通过亚喀巴湾。美国这个做法，实际上是要埃及接受以色列的撤军条件，打击埃及人民争取民族独立的斗争意志，以便于它在中东地区推行所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划。　（胡真）
