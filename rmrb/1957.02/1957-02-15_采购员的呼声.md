    A Purchaser's Plea
    Since the opening of the Handan Free Market in Hebei Province, the number of purchasers coming from various places to buy goods has been increasing daily. According to statistics from mid-December of last year, there were more than 70 purchasers regularly staying at the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Handan Prefectural Office Guesthouse alone (including those from Guangdong, Hunan, Dalian, Inner Mongolia, and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as state-owned companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives from various prefectures and counties within the province). Due to the over-concentration of purchasers and the limited supply of goods in the market, the market's material supply has become very strained. As a result, a chaotic situation of purchasers raising prices to compete for goods once occurred in the Handan market. To control the market and stabilize prices, the Handan Municipal Market Management Committee stipulated that all purchasers coming to the Handan market to buy goods must first register with the Municipal Bureau of Commerce, and the exchange would make purchases on their behalf in the order of arrival. Despite this, purchasers from various places continued to come to Handan to compete for goods. This competition is very blind, and many purchasers are dissatisfied with this approach. The following is a conversation with a purchaser from the Changzhou City Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiangsu Province. He said: "My task this time is to purchase black and white melon seeds and some walnuts and walnut kernels. I first went to Shijiazhuang, but couldn't buy any goods. Then I went to Taiyuan City, but still couldn't buy any. Only then did I come to Handan. After registering, I have to wait half a month to twenty days before it's my turn to buy, and I'm not even sure how much I'll be able to buy. Looking at the purchase price, black and white melon seeds are more than double the price in Jiangsu Province, but in order to supply the market, the leaders agreed to buy them even at six jiao per jin. However, northern Jiangsu Province also produces black and white melon seeds, but the commercial leaders didn't plan ahead and sold them all outside the province. Now, we have to run around looking for this source of goods." He also said: "There are many similar things. For example, Shandong sells persimmon cakes to Jiangsu, but Shandong also goes to Hebei to buy persimmon cakes; Shanxi red dates are sold to Guangdong, but Shanxi also comes to Hebei to purchase red dates. This approach is very chaotic. We run around and can't buy goods, which is a real waste."
    Most purchasers from other regions are also buying the above-mentioned products. Many of them have to spend time and money waiting there for half a month just to get one day of purchasing. Some purchasers have waited for a long time but can't find a source of goods. They lamented: "Our task is to 'purchase reimbursement slips and promote Renminbi!'" Many of them hope that the competent commercial departments in their regions will strengthen internal commodity adjustments and planned allocations to eliminate the artificial market supply tensions and waste of state funds caused by blind purchasing.

### 采购员的呼声

    采购员的呼声
    河北省邯郸自由市场开放以来，各地采购员来这里采购商品的日渐增多，据去年12月中旬统计，只是经常住在河北省供销社邯郸专区办事处招待所的各地采购人员就有七十多人（包括广东、湖南、旅大、内蒙古和北京、天津二市以及本省各专、县的国营公司和供销社、手工业社等单位）。由于采购人员过于集中，市场商品有限，形成了市场物资供应十分紧张的局面，因之，邯郸市场曾经一度发生采购员抬价争购商品的混乱现象。邯郸市市场管理委员会为掌握市场、平稳价格，规定凡来邯郸市场采购商品的采购员，首先应到市商业局进行登记，按先来后到的次序排定日期，由交易所代为收购。虽然这样，各地采购员还是陆续前来邯郸争购。这种争购带有很大的盲目性，许多采购员对这样的做法也是不满意的，下面就是江苏常州市供销社采购员的谈话。他说：这次出来的任务是采购黑、白瓜子和部分核桃、核桃仁。我先到了石家庄，买不到货，又跑到太原市，仍买不到，才来到邯郸，登记后，需等半月二十天才能轮到我买，能买到多少还不一定。从收购价格上看，黑、白瓜子都超过江苏省价格的一倍，但为了供应市场，领导上同意每斤六角也得收购。但是江苏省北部也产黑、白瓜子，商业领导部门因事前没有计划，都外销了，而现在却不得不到处乱跑寻找这种货源。他又说：像这样的事还有很多。如山东卖给江苏柿饼，而山东又到河北去收购柿饼；山西红枣销往广东，而山西又来河北采购红枣。这样做法很乱，跑来跑去买不到货，真是浪费。
    其他地区采购员也大都是收购上述产品的。他们当中还有许多人为了争取收购一天，而不得不耗时伤财地在那里等上半个月之久。有的采购员等了好久也找不到货源，他们痛惜地说：我们出来的任务是“采购报销单，推销人民币！”他们当中许多人都希望本地区的主管商业部门通过加强商品的内部调剂和计划调拨来消除因盲目采购而造成人为的市场供应紧张和浪费国家资金的现象。　　　　赵自先
