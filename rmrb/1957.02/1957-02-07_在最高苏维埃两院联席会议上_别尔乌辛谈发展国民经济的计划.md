Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: TASS reported that Biryuzov, First Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Economic Commission, made a report at the joint session of the two chambers of the USSR Supreme Soviet on the 5th. He said that the plan for the development of the Soviet national economy submitted to the meeting for review is based on the instructions of the December plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee, which pointed out the way to eliminate serious shortcomings in planning and economic institutions, and further clarified the direction of this year's national economic plan.

Biryuzov then briefly talked about the results of the implementation of last year's economic plan. He pointed out that the past year was a year in which the Soviet people achieved great achievements in all aspects of economic work, and the country has taken a big step forward in the cause of communist construction. Socialist industry overfulfilled last year's plan, with total production increasing by nearly 11% compared with 1955, of which the production of means of production increased by 11.4% and the production of daily necessities increased by 9.4%. It is particularly gratifying that agriculture has confidently embarked on the road of rapid development. The Party and the government have also implemented a series of major measures to further improve the people's welfare. However, although the national economy has generally grown tremendously, the production plans of some industrial sectors, such as ferrous metallurgy, coal mining, cement, and the forest industry, have not been fully completed, and the production of some industrial products and food cannot fully meet the growing needs of residents.

Biryuzov then talked about the national economic plan for the second year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. He said that this year's plan mainly focuses on meeting the needs of the national economy for materials and raw materials necessary for completing production and construction plans, such as fuel and metal, on further developing agriculture, increasing the production of national consumer goods, greatly improving housing construction, and further improving the people's material welfare and cultural level.

Biryuzov said that the total industrial production in the Soviet Union this year is planned to increase by 7.1% compared with last year, of which the production of means of production will increase by 7.8% and the production of consumer goods will increase by 5.9%. This year, it is planned to mine 446.2 million tons of coal, an increase of 27.2 million tons compared with last year, and Donbas will increase production by 13.6 million tons.

The plan attaches special importance to the development of the oil and gas industries. Oil extraction will reach 97 million tons, 16% more than last year. Gas extraction will increase by 7.7 billion cubic meters, or 57% more than last year. This year, 2,390 kilometers of gas pipelines will be built so that many cities can get and increase the supply of gas.

The level of metal production largely determines the speed of the entire national economic development, and first of all, the speed of machine manufacturing development. This year, the planned smelting volume of pig iron is 38.1 million tons, steel is 51.5 million tons, and the production of rolled steel is 39.5 million tons (excluding the steel production of local industrial enterprises).

The country's power base will be greatly strengthened. Electricity production will reach 211.2 billion kilowatt-hours. The Kuibyshev Hydropower Station and the Kara-Kum Hydropower Station will be fully put into production this year. More units of the Irkutsk and Novosibirsk hydropower stations will be put into operation, the Stalingrad Hydropower Station project will be stepped up, and the Saratov Hydropower Station will also be built. In addition, it is also planned to build a number of thermal power plants with large power generation capacity, and some nuclear power plants are also being designed and built.

The plan is to further develop machine manufacturing. In the total industrial output value, machine manufacturing and metal processing industries will increase by 10.2%. Compared with last year, the output of agricultural machinery will increase by 24%, internal combustion locomotives will increase by one and a half times, electric locomotives will increase by 38%, forging and pressing machines will increase by 17%, and the output of various automatic instruments and tools will increase by 30%. It is stipulated to expand the production of various new and more advanced machines and equipment.

The building materials industry is primarily the development of the cement industry. The plan is to increase cement production by 3.6 million tons, or 14.7% more than last year, and the production of prefabricated reinforced concrete components and structures will increase by more than one-half.

The timber and paper industries will also be further developed. This year's plan stipulates the transportation of 192.4 million cubic meters of economic timber. He mentioned the problem that the logging industry has not completed the plan for many years, which has caused great difficulties in the supply of timber for construction sites.

Regarding the development of light industry and the textile industry, the plan stipulates that the production of flax fabrics should increase by 10.2%, woolen fabrics by 3.6%, silk fabrics by 4.7%, and leather shoes by 6.7%. It is also stipulated to increase the production of cotton fabrics.

On the basis of the achievements already made in agriculture, it is stipulated this year to further increase the production of the food industry. Sugar production will increase by 9.5% compared with last year, and meat and meat products will increase by 13.3%. Dairy products will increase to twice that of 1955.

Biryuzov pointed out that, according to the existing production capacity, the tasks of the processing industry can be overfulfilled this year. Enterprise and departmental leaders should ensure that the work of the enterprise can be carried out uninterruptedly and evenly, not exceeding the allocated materials, and not reducing the prescribed material flow reserves. The most important thing is to save electricity, fuel, metal, and industrial raw materials.

The reporter then talked about some shortcomings in the work of machine tractor stations and state farms. He pointed out that the growth rate of agricultural product output cannot be considered sufficient, and the annual growth rate of these products must be greatly increased to increase the purchase volume of agricultural products.

This year, transportation and postal and telecommunications services will also develop, and the appropriations for railway electrification will be more than doubled.

Biryuzov also talked about the issue of basic construction. He said that the total amount of national investment in this area this year is 175 billion rubles. Housing construction will be greatly increased. It is planned to build and put into use residential buildings with a total area of 46 million square meters with state investment and residents' funds (with state subsidies), which is 28% larger than last year.

The report then made a statement on further improving the material welfare of the Soviet people and increasing national income. This year, the retail sales of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce are planned to increase by 57 billion rubles compared with last year, which is a speed of increase that the Soviet Union has never had in the past. The plan also stipulates to further develop the school network, expand the training of experts in all sectors of the national economy, and develop science and health undertakings.

When talking about foreign trade, Biryuzov said that this year the trade volume between the Soviet Union and socialist countries will increase by 13% compared with last year, and by 120% compared with 1950. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and Asian and African countries such as India and Egypt almost doubled last year. The Soviet Union's trade with many Western capitalist countries is also expanding, but due to some obstacles and obstructions, the possibilities in this regard have not yet been fully utilized.

Biryuzov finally said that the plan submitted to the meeting for discussion proves the further growth of the Soviet state's economic power and the overall upsurge of all sectors of the Soviet national economy. Despite the great efforts made by the bourgeois press and radio stations to slander the socialist system, they still cannot hide this fact from the working people of capitalist countries.

When the Soviet working people are starting to implement the 1957 plan with new energy, as a result of the measures taken by the Party and the government, all economic sectors of the Soviet Union have much more favorable conditions for completing and overfulfilling the national plan.

    在最高苏维埃两院联席会议上
    别尔乌辛谈发展国民经济的计划
    去年是苏联人民在经济工作的各方面获得巨大成就的一年。今年计划的主要注意力放在燃料、金属等为完成生产建设计划所必需的材料方面，放在进一步发展农业、增加国民消费品以及改善住宅建筑和提高人民物质福利文化水平方面。
      新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联部长会议第一副主席、国家经济委员会主席别尔乌辛5日在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上作报告。他说，提交给会议审查的发展苏联国民经济的计划是以苏共中央去年12月全体会议的指示作为基础的，它为消除计划和经济机构中的严重缺点指出了道路，并且进一步明确了今年国民经济计划的方向。
    别尔乌辛接着扼要谈了去年经济计划的执行结果。他指出，过去的一年是苏联人民在经济工作的各方面获得巨大成就的一年，国家已在共产主义建设事业上向前迈了一大步。社会主义工业超额完成了去年的计划，总生产量比1955年将近增加11％，其中生产资料的生产增加11.4％，日用必需品的生产增加9.4％。而特别令人高兴的是农业有把握地走上了急剧发展的道路。党和政府还实行了一系列进一步提高人民福利的重大措施。但是，虽然总的说来国民经济有了巨大增长，而有些工业部门，如黑色冶金业、采煤、水泥和森林工业的生产计划却没有全部完成，有些工业产品和食品的生产还不能够完全满足居民日益增长的需要。
    别尔乌辛接着谈到第六个五年计划第二年的国家经济计划。他说，今年计划的主要注意力放在满足国民经济在燃料、金属等为完成生产建设计划所必需的材料和原料的需要方面，放在进一步发展农业、增加国民消费品生产方面，放在大大改善住宅建筑工作和进一步提高人民物质福利和文化水平方面。
    别尔乌辛说，苏联今年工业总生产量规定比去年增长7.1％，其中生产资料的生产增加7.8％，消费资料的生产增加5.9％。今年预定开采四亿四千六百二十万吨煤，比去年增加二千七百二十万吨，而顿巴斯将增产一千三百六十万吨。
    计划特别重视石油工业和煤气工业的发展。石油开采量达到九千七百万吨，比去年多16％。煤气开采量要增加七十七亿立方公尺，即比去年增加57％。今年将建造二千三百九十公里长的煤气管，使许多城市都可得到和增加煤气的供应量。
    金属生产水平在很大程度上决定着整个国民经济发展的速度，首先决定着机器制造业发展的速度。今年，生铁的熔炼量预定为三千八百一十万吨，钢为五千一百五十万吨，轧材的生产为三千九百五十万吨（不包括地方工业企业的钢铁产量）。
    国家动力基地要大大加强。电力生产将达到二千一百一十二亿度。古比雪夫水电站和卡拉—库姆水电站今年将要全部投入生产。伊尔库次克和新西伯利亚的水电站将有更多联动机投入生产，斯大林格勒水电站工程将加紧进行，萨拉托夫水电站也将兴建。此外，还计划建设一些发电能力很大的火电站，一些原子能发电站也正在设计和建设中。
    计划要进一步发展机器制造业。在工业总产值中，机器制造业和金属加工工业将增加10.2％。同去年比较，农业机器产量要提高24％，内燃机车要提高一倍半，而电气机车要提高38％，锻压机器要提高17％、各种自动化仪器和工具产量要提高30％。规定扩大生产各种新的、更先进的机器和设备。
    建筑材料工业首先是发展水泥工业。计划水泥产量增加三百六十万吨，即比去年多14.7％，装配式钢筋混凝土构件和结构产量增加二分之一以上。
    木材和造纸工业也将得到进一步的发展。今年计划规定运出一亿九千二百四十万立方公尺的经济用木材。他提到伐木工业连年没有完成计划因而使建筑工地的木材供应产生很大困难的问题。
    关于轻工业和纺织工业的发展，计划规定麻织品的生产要增加10.2％，毛织品增加3.6％，丝织品增加4.7％，皮鞋增加6.7％。还规定要增加棉织品的生产。
    在农业已经获得成就的基础上，今年规定要进一步增加食品工业的生产。糖产量要比去年增加9.5％，肉和肉制品要增加13.3％。乳制品要增加为1955年的两倍。
    别尔乌辛指出，根据现有的生产能力，今年加工工业的任务可以超额完成。企业和各部领导人应当使企业的工作能够不间断和均衡地进行，不超出拨出的物资的范围，不降低规定的物资流动储备。而最重要的是节约用电、燃料、金属和工业原料。
    报告人接着谈到了机器拖拉机站和国营农场工作中的一些缺点。他指出，农产品产量增长的速度还不能认为是足够的，必须大大提高这些产品每年增长的速度，增加农产品的收购量。
    今年交通运输和邮电事业也将有发展，用在铁路电气化的拨款将增加一倍多。
    别尔乌辛还谈到了基本建设的问题。他说，国家今年在这方面的投资总额为一千七百五十亿卢布。住宅建筑要大大增加。预定以国家投资和居民资金（国家给予补助）建成总面积为四千六百万平方公尺的住宅，并且开始使用，这比去年大28％。
    报告随后就进一步提高苏联人民物质福利、增加国民收入等问题作了说明。今年国营商业和合作社商业零售额预定比去年增加五百七十亿卢布，这个增加速度是苏联过去从来没有的。计划还规定进一步发展学校网，扩大国民经济一切部门的专家培养工作，发展科学和卫生事业等。
    在谈到对外贸易的时候，别尔乌辛说，今年苏联同社会主义国家的贸易额要比去年增加13％，比1950年增加120％。苏联同印度、埃及等亚非国家的贸易额，去年几乎增加了一倍。苏联同许多西方资本主义国家的贸易也在扩大，然而由于一些障碍和阻挠，这方面的可能性还远没有被充分利用。
    别尔乌辛最后说，提交会议讨论的计划证明了苏维埃国家经济威力的进一步增长，苏联国民经济各部门的全面高涨。资产阶级报刊和电台尽管作了巨大努力来诽谤社会主义制度，他们还是无法向资本主义国家的劳动人民掩盖住这个事实。
    苏联劳动人民在以新的精力来着手实现1957年度的计划的时候，由于党和政府采取的措施的结果，苏联一切经济部门有着完成和超额完成国家计划的有利得多的条件。
