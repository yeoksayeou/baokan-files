Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 21st. At the recent Guangxi Provincial Party Committee convened Provincial Sideline Production Work Representatives Meeting, the whole province last year sideline production was a comprehensive summary. The meeting on agricultural cooperatives farming and sideline comprehensive development issues, the scope of cooperative and members sideline management, mutual benefit policies, purchase prices, and how to resolve the problem of pig feed were widely exchanged. And formulated the province this year to develop sideline production plans. The plan requires each household to raise one and a half to two pigs, and each person to raise an average of three or more poultry; requires total sideline income for the year to reach 80 to 120 yuan per household. Agricultural cooperatives whose sideline income exceeded 120 yuan per household last year are required to increase income by 30%. Strive to achieve increased production in every cooperative and increased income for every household.

After Guangxi Province realized advanced agricultural cooperation last spring, it once relaxed its leadership over sideline production in guiding agricultural production. This led to a situation in many areas where grain production increased, but the total income of cooperative members did not increase. After taking various effective measures, sideline development in the province developed rapidly in the second half of last year, resulting in a significant increase in the cash income of cooperative members. In Xin Sheng Agricultural Cooperative in He County, more than 90% of farmers borrowed from the agricultural cooperative in the first half of the year. After developing sideline production, this phenomenon disappeared. In Nong Xing Agricultural Cooperative in Tianyang County, which suffered severe drought in the Shishan area, grain production decreased and income fell, and 90% of the cooperative members wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. After developing sideline production in the second half of the year, the collective sideline income of the cooperative alone earned each household 22 yuan in cash, thus stabilizing the production mood of the cooperative members. While doing a good job in collective sideline production, the Qulou Agricultural Cooperative in Wuming County also arranged for cooperative members' household sideline production. At the end of the year, every household increased their income.

The experience of Guangxi Province in developing sideline production last year proves that in order to enable agricultural cooperative members to increase production and income, it is necessary to develop agriculture and sideline industries in an all-round way, and neither should be neglected.

    广西省总结去年副业生产
    农业副业生产必须全面发展
    新华社南宁21日电　在最近中共广西省委召开的全省副业生产工作代表会议上，对去年全省副业生产进行了全面的总结。会议就农业社农、副业全面发展的问题、社和社员间副业经营的范围、互利政策、收购价格以及如何解决猪的饲料等问题广泛交流了经验。并制定了今年全省发展副业生产的计划。计划要求每户养猪一头半到两头，每人平均养家禽三只以上；要求副业总收入全年每户达到八十元到一百二十元。去年每户副业收入已经超过一百二十元的农业社，要求增加收入30％。争取做到社社增产，户户增加收入。
    广西省去年春天实现高级农业合作化后，在指导农业生产上曾一度放松了对副业生产的领导。使不少地区出现粮食增产社员的总收入没有增加的情况。经过采取各种有效措施后，去年下半年全省副业发展很快，使社员现金收入有显著的增加。贺县新生农业社，去年上半年90％以上的农户向农业社借支，开展副业生产后，这种现象已经没有了；石山地区受着严重旱灾的田阳县弄兴农业社，粮食减产减收，全社有90％的社员闹退社，下半年开展了副业生产后，仅是社的集体副业收入，每户就分得现金二十二元，因而稳定了社员的生产情绪；武鸣县区楼农业社在搞好集体副业生产的同时，并安排好社员家庭副业生产，年终结算时，户户都增加了收入。
    广西省去年开展副业生产的经验证明：要使农业社社员增产又增收，就必需农、副业全面发展，不可偏废。
