    Scientific Research and Data Problems
    Hu Weibai
    Realizing scientific planning requires sufficient data. Here, I would like to share my opinions on data-related matters.
    The work of supplementing old data and collecting new data must be strengthened. Currently, scientific workers often feel distressed because some old data that they saw abroad in the past cannot be found or is incomplete domestically. When young people start conducting scientific research, they often request, "Please introduce some data," and we find it difficult to find sufficient data to meet their needs. This can also be said to be one of the specific difficulties in realizing scientific planning. To overcome this difficulty, it is important to supplement old data (such as complete sets of old magazines, necessary collections of papers, etc.) nationwide using methods of mutual collation and photocopying. This work is already underway. Currently, more and more complete photocopies of magazines in basic sciences are available, but there are not many types of photocopied old magazines in technical sciences (such as mining and metallurgy), which cannot meet the urgent needs. Furthermore, in view of the progress of science and technology, most of the literature to be consulted is from the last ten to fifteen years. Although literature from twenty to fifty years ago is also valuable and necessary, it is consulted less frequently and can be done at a later stage. Since photocopying capacity is limited, it is best to first print old magazines from 1940 or 1945 to the present, printing more types, and then supplement with reprints from 1925 to 1945, and even before 1925.
    To collect new data, we must strengthen the import of foreign books and magazines. Currently, this work is mainly concentrated in the International Bookstore in Beijing. Under the call for a great march toward science, our country will have hundreds and thousands of institutions, schools, and units, and tens of thousands of scientific workers. Therefore, although the International Bookstore has done a lot of work, it still cannot meet the needs of readers. For example, we are often eagerly waiting for new magazines, but the International Bookstore often experiences omissions and incorrect deliveries. The subscription catalogs for foreign magazines are not precise and perfect enough. For example, the 1957 subscription catalog is much better and more complete than in the past, but from the perspective of my professional knowledge, I feel that some unnecessary and relatively low-level magazines are still listed, while some extremely important professional magazines are still missing. This shows that the work of inviting experts from various fields to assist in the appraisal when selecting foreign magazine catalogs still needs to be strengthened. Among imported books, there are few collections of special papers from foreign scientific research institutions, research reports, journals of universities, and other irregular collections of academic discussions. These materials are certainly not as easy to find as books published and distributed by regular publishing houses, but most of these special reports and journals are publicly sold and can be found. And these materials are extremely needed for scientific research work. The method of readers entrusting the purchase of books is also not reasonable enough. In order to ensure the data needed to realize scientific planning, we urgently request that the import of new foreign data be strengthened as soon as possible.
    Accelerate the preparation and publication of scientific paper indexes, abstracts, and special translation series, and improve and expand the current various scientific translation reports. Because there is a lot of scientific data, it must be organized and exchanged to facilitate its utilization. Scientific abstracts are the guide to start researching and collecting data. For example, the famous English "Chemical Abstracts," which has been published since 1907, abstracts new papers, new data, and special publications related to chemistry, and has become an important reference for research work related to chemistry. The scientific abstracts edited and published by the Scientific Information Bureau of the Soviet Academy of Sciences are even larger in scale. In addition to abstracting papers published in the Soviet Union, they also abstract scientific works and special publications from eighty other countries. The number of magazines abstracted reaches nine thousand. This abstract is published monthly (some semi-monthly) in twelve categories, becoming one of the symbols of the Soviet Union's solid scientific foundation and comprehensive development. In view of the fact that not many people in our country have mastered several foreign languages, and at the same time, each institution cannot universally subscribe to as many as nine thousand magazines published in eighty countries, in order to enable our scientists to quickly grasp the pulse of international science, it is hoped that the Academy of Sciences and relevant departments will organize experts in various disciplines to prepare and publish Chinese "Scientific Abstracts" and "Index of Foreign Scientific Papers" as soon as possible.
    Although our country has already published some journals, bulletins, and translation reports, etc., in order to enable the vast number of new scientific workers to be familiar with and master scientific literature, it is necessary to publish comprehensive review magazines as soon as possible, such as the Soviet "Advances in Chemistry" type of magazines, which publish reviews written by experts and scholars on a certain issue, expounding the current situation of this issue, the crux of the dispute, and the direction of development, and the end of the article often includes a list of important references, so that readers can quickly become familiar with the situation and find a way in. We should also publish special translation series, compiling and translating papers related to a certain issue scattered in magazines from various countries into volumes. This kind of translation series is published a lot in advanced countries. Through this kind of translation series, readers can preserve systematic original basic literature and grasp the past research situation of a certain issue.
    Our country has already published some translation reports, but in terms of the types of disciplines, it is still far from enough. For example, in the technical sciences, there is no complete and regular translation report in the fields of mining, mineral processing, and metallurgy. At the same time, these published translation reports only translate Soviet papers, which is also very insufficient. The Soviet Union has many translation reports such as "Modern Metallurgical Problems" and "Chemical Industry," which translate papers from English, German, and French. Taking the mineral processing profession as an example, not only the Soviet Union publishes many good papers, but magazines published in the United States, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Africa, Australia, and other places also often publish valuable papers. Currently, we can obtain Soviet papers relatively easily, and most young scientific workers can read Russian, but only a few older generations have a good grasp of English, German, and French. Therefore, our translation reports should definitely focus on introducing advanced Soviet science, but we should also select and translate papers from other countries that are indeed valuable, which is in line with the requirements of our country's scientific development.
    It is recommended to establish data centers and institutions for literature photocopying, abstracting, and translation. The data in some data rooms and libraries in our country is not only incomplete, but there is also the phenomenon of "everyone has what everyone has, and everyone lacks what everyone lacks." In the future, everyone will mainly select and order materials based on a catalog from the International Bookstore, which will create a situation where "everyone orders what is important, and no one orders what is secondary." Therefore, I believe that in addition to universal development in various places, we should establish data centers based on certain regions and certain professions, in conjunction with scientific bases, and designate certain research institutions or universities. The planning for the collection, organization, storage, and utilization of relevant data for these data centers should be led by a special academic committee. The government should not only provide more funding, but also provide some support in the system (such as designating relevant departments to forward data, etc.), so that these data centers can develop into complete data reference institutions for a region or a discipline.
    At the same time, in order to make data play a better role, libraries or data centers in advanced countries often have data service institutions attached to them. It can copy, photocopy, and translate certain designated data according to the needs of readers, and more advanced ones can also compile literature abstract cards on a special topic. This work is only initially being done by the Beijing Library in our country. Because it is helpful to scientific research work, it should be promoted.
    Domestic and foreign data exchange. Through exchange, research work can communicate with each other, become familiar with each other, and criticize each other to improve. The significance of this for promoting scientific research is self-evident. However, there is a specific issue that needs to be studied, that is, the issue of confidentiality. The current situation is: on the one hand, the confidentiality work is not strict and effective enough; on the other hand, the scope of confidentiality for scientific and technological data is not clearly defined, and data that should not be confidential is often included in the scope of confidentiality. Some technical data that can be exchanged after removing place names and absolute numbers are often listed as "top secret" or "secret documents." The methods for borrowing confidential data are also not completely reasonable. This issue should be carefully and specifically resolved so that it can indeed maintain confidentiality and facilitate scientific research.
    Exchanging data with foreign countries is beneficial to promoting science in our country. Since liberation, we have established many research institutions and universities and published some valuable works. However, due to the limitations of the Chinese language, we have not timely introduced them to the international scientific community. I think this work is worth doing, especially in a few years when our scientific papers are published like mushrooms after a rain, we need to exchange with the international scientific community, contribute our achievements, and strive for criticism and lessons from international friends.
    Data is one of the basic conditions for conducting scientific research. Only on the basis of advanced, timely, and abundant data can our country's scientific planning be successfully realized. It can also be said that the accumulation, organization, utilization, and dissemination of scientific and technological data is one of the signs of a country's scientific foundation. The above opinions are not necessarily correct, and I am willing to provide them for consideration by relevant departments.

    科学研究中的资料问题
    胡为柏
    实现科学规划，需要有足够的资料。这里我谈谈对资料方面的意见。
    有关补齐旧资料和搜集新资料的工作必须加强。目前科学工作者们常常感到苦恼，那就是有些过去在国外曾经见到过的旧资料，在国内找不到或者不全；而青年们开始进行科学研究时常提出“请介绍一些资料”的要求，我们难于找到充分的资料满足他们的需要。这也可以说是实现科学规划的具体困难之一。为了克服这一困难，在全国范围内，利用互相拼凑和影印的办法来补齐旧资料（如整套的旧杂志，必要的论文集等）是很重要的工作。这项工作已经在进行。目前在基本科学方面的杂志影印的较多较全，但是技术科学（如矿冶方面）的旧杂志影印种类不多，就不能满足迫切的需要。并且鉴于科学技术的进展，要查阅的文献大都是近十年到十五年的。二十年以至五十年前的文献虽然也是宝贵而必要的，但是查阅的次数少，可以稍缓一步。影印的力量有限，最好先印1940或者1945年到目前的旧杂志，多印几种，以后再补印1925到1945年的，甚至1925年以前的。
    要搜集新资料，就要加强国外书刊杂志的进口工作。目前这一工作主要集中在北京的国际书店。在向科学大进军的号召下，像我们这样的国家，机关、学校单位将以几百几千计，而科学工作者将以万计，所以国际书店虽然做了许多工作，但还是不能满足读者的要求。譬如说，对于新出的杂志，我们常是如饥如渴地等待，但是国际书店常发生漏寄、错寄的现象；关于国外杂志的征订目录，不够精当完善，如1957年度的征订目录，虽然比过去好得多、全得多，但是从我知道的专业来看，觉得有些不必要的、水平比较低的杂志还是列在上面，而有些极重要的专业杂志还是没有，足见在选择国外杂志目录的时候，请各方面专家协助鉴定的工作还待加强。在进口书籍中很少国外科学研究机关的专题论文集、研究专报、高等学校的学报以及其他不定期的学术讨论会文集等，这些资料当然不如大出版社正规出版发行的书籍那么容易找到，可是这些专报、学报大部分是公开发售的，也是可以找到的。而这些资料对于科学研究工作来说，是极其需要的。读者委托购书的办法也不够合理，为了保证实现科学规划所需要的资料，我们迫切要求及早加强国外新资料的进口工作。
    加速筹备出版科学论文索引、文摘、专题译丛，并改进和扩大目前各种科学译报。由于科学资料很多，必须经过整理和交流，才便于利用。而科学文摘是开始研究搜集资料的导引。例如有名的英文“化学文摘”从1907年出版到现在，摘录了有关化学的新论文新资料和专刊等，已经成为同化学有关的研究工作的重要参考文献。苏联科学院科学资料局所编辑出版的科学文摘，规模更为庞大，除了摘录苏联出版的论文以外，并且摘录了其他八十个国家的科学著作和专刊等，被摘录的杂志达九千种。这一文摘按月（有的每半月）分成十二类出版，成为苏联科学基础雄厚、发展全面的标志之一。鉴于我国掌握好几种外国文的人不多，同时各机构也不能普遍都订阅八十个国家出版的九千种之多的杂志，为了使我国科学家能很快地掌握国际科学的脉息，希望科学院同有关部门组织各科专家及早筹备出版中文的“科学文摘”和“国外科学论文索引”。
    我国目前虽然已经出了一些学报、通报、译报等，但是为了使广大的新生的科学工作者熟悉和掌握科学文献，必须及早出版综合述评性的杂志，如苏联的“化学进展”类的杂志，其中刊载专家学者所写的关于某一问题的述评，阐述这一问题的现况、争论症结以及发展方向，并且文末常附有重要的参考文献目录，使读者能很快地熟悉情况，找到门径。还应该出版专题译丛，把散见各国杂志中有关某一问题的论文汇齐编译成册。这种译丛在先进国家出得很多，通过这种译丛，读者可以保存有系统的原始基本文献，掌握某一问题过去研究的情况。
    我国目前已经出版了一些译报，但是从学科种类来看，还差得很远。如技术科学中的采矿、选矿、冶金方面就没有一本完整的定期的译报。同时这些已经出版的译报只译苏联论文，这也是很不够的。苏联就有许多种像“近代冶金问题”“化工”等译报，是译英文、德文、法文的论文的。就选矿专业来说，不仅苏联发表许多好论文，美国、德国、匈牙利、印度、日本、荷兰、非洲、澳大利亚等地出版的杂志也常发表有价值的论文。目前苏联的论文我们得到比较容易，而大多数年轻科学工作者能看俄文，至于英、德、法文，却只是老一辈的少数人掌握得好一些，所以我们的译报应该肯定以介绍苏联先进科学为重点，但是对其他国家确有价值的论文也应该选译，这是合于我国科学发展的要求的。
    建议建立资料中心及文献复印、摘录翻译的机构。我国已有的一些资料室、图书馆，资料不仅残缺，还有“有的大家有，缺的大家缺”的现象。今后大家添购资料，主要根据国际书店的一本目录去选订，将会造成“重要的大家都订，次要的谁也没有订”的情况，所以我认为除了各地普遍发展以外，应该根据一定的地区、一定的专业，配合科学据点，指定一定的研究机构或高等学校建立资料中心。对于这些资料中心，有关资料的搜集、整理、保管、利用等的规划，应该有专门的学术委员会领导。政府不仅应该给予比较多的经费，并且在制度上给予一些支持（如指定有关部门抄送资料等）。使这些资料中心能发展成为一个地区或者一个学科的完善的资料参考机构。
    同时，为了使资料更好地发挥作用，在先进国家的图书馆或者资料中心，常附设有资料服务机构。它可以根据读者的需要，代为抄写、影印、翻译某些指定的资料，高级一些的还可以根据专题代为查编文献摘录卡片。这种工作，我国仅有北京图书馆初步在做。由于它对科学研究工作有帮助，应该推广。
    国内外资料交流问题。通过交流，能使研究工作互通声息、互相熟悉、互相批评提高。这对推进科学研究的意义是不用多说的。但是其中有一个要具体研究的问题，那就是保密问题。目前的情况是：一方面保密工作做得还不严密而有效；而另一方面是对科学技术资料的保密范围划分不清，往往把不该保密的列入保密范围，有些去掉地名和绝对数字后就可以交流的技术资料，往往被列为“绝密”或者“机密文件”。对于保密资料的借阅办法等也还不完全合理。应当慎重而具体地解决这一问题，使它既可以确实保密，又便于科学研究。
    同国外交流资料，对促进我国科学是有利的。解放以来，我们已建立了许多研究机构和高等学校，发表过一些有价值的著作。但是由于汉文的限制，并没有及时地把它们向国际科学界介绍。我想这种工作是值得我们举办的，特别在几年以后我们科学论文如雨后春笋似地纷纷发表的时候，更需要同国际科学界进行交流，贡献我们的成绩，同时争取国际友人们的批评和教益。
    资料是进行科学研究的基本条件之一。只有在先进的、及时的、丰富的资料基础上，我国的科学规划才能顺利地实现。也可以这样说，对于科学技术资料的积累、整编、利用、传播的情况，是一个国家的科学基础的标志之一。上述意见不一定是正确的，愿提供有关部门考虑。
