    The Creativity of Young Workers
    Young worker Li Baolin, who originally only knew how to write his own name and worked as a pedicab driver, has now been promoted to technician. In 1951, he started working at the Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private East Asia Wool and Linen Textile Factory. Through persistent study, he has mastered professional skills and has successively created two instruments with high quality requirements in the textile industry: the "Inductance Tide Gauge" and the "Photoelectric Colorimeter." Recently, he has also developed a "Photoelectric Automatic Control Sliver Uniformity Tester." Using this instrument can help control the uniformity rate of roving sliver, improve yarn quality, and greatly shorten the process. This is Li Baolin installing this instrument.

    青年工人的创造
    青年工人李宝林，原来是个只会写自己名字的三轮车工人，现在，已经被提升为技术员了。1951年他到天津市公私合营东亚毛麻纺织厂工作，经过顽强的学习，已经掌握了专业技术，并且先后创造了“电感测潮器”、“光电比色器”两部在纺织工业上质量要求较高的仪器。最近，他又研究成一种“光电自动控制并条均匀器”，使用这种仪器可以掌握好粗纱并条的均匀率，提高纱支质量，也可以大大缩短工艺过程。这是李宝林正在装置这一仪器。　新华社记者　张映华摄
