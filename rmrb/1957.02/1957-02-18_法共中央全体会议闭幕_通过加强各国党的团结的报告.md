Xinhua News Agency, February 17th, TASS, Paris, February 16th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party (PCF) concluded its plenary session on February 16th after hearing and passing the report by Raymond Guyot on the second item on the agenda – the question of the mutual relations between the PCF and the communist and workers' parties of other countries. In his report, Guyot emphasized that in dealing with the new problems that have recently arisen, the PCF should be faithful to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and stress the urgent necessity of the communist movement uniting around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

Guyot said that throughout the entire period of the very vigorous development of the international workers' and communist movements, the PCF and its Central Committee have consistently stood firm on the position of Marxism-Leninism, regardless of pressure, slander and defamation, and regardless of the frenzied attacks from all sides. And now, after years of arduous struggle, we can say that we were right in the past. In this struggle, the PCF has become stronger, and its prestige has also been enhanced.

Guyot emphasized the consolidated ties between the PCF and the fraternal CPSU; the two parties have complete agreement on all issues related to the international communist movement and the international workers' movement.

Guyot then analyzed in detail the results of the meetings between the PCF delegation and the representatives of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party.

He stressed that there must now be new forms of cooperation between the fraternal parties. However, he said, regardless of the form of such cooperation, for communists and the proletariat of all countries, in their struggle against oppression and exploitation, against imperialism, the decisive factor remains: the strength of socialism acting in a fundamental direction and uniting around the CPSU.

In concluding his report, Guyot suggested launching activities nationwide to prepare for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, in order to once again demonstrate the traditional friendship and solidarity of the French working people with the Soviet Union.

The plenary session also adopted a resolution on holding a week of struggle for peace in Algeria from February 25th to March 3rd.

The plenary session established a committee for the compilation of the history of the PCF.

    法共中央全体会议闭幕
    通过加强各国党的团结的报告
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社巴黎16日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议16日在听取和通过了雷蒙·居约就第二项议程——关于法国共产党同其他国家共产党和工人党的相互关系问题所作的报告之后闭幕。居约在报告中着重指出，法国共产党在对付最近发生的新问题时应当忠实于马克思列宁主义原则和强调共产主义运动团结在苏联共产党周围的迫切必要性。
    居约说，法国共产党和它的中央委员会在国际工人运动和共产主义运动的整个非常蓬勃发展的时期中，曾不顾压力、谰言和诽谤，不顾各方面的猖狂进攻，始终站稳马克思列宁主义的立场。而现在，在艰苦斗争的年代之后，我们可以说，我们过去是正确的。在这个斗争中，法国共产党变得更加坚强，它的威信也更加提高了。
    居约强调指出了法国共产党同兄弟的苏联共产党之间的巩固联系；两党在有关国际共产主义运动和国际工人运动的一切问题上的看法完全一致。
    居约接着详细分析了法国共产党代表团同捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表和同波兰统一工人党领导人员会谈的成果。
    他强调指出，现在各兄弟党之间必须有新的合作形式。但是，他说，不管这种合作形式如何，对于各国共产党人和无产阶级来说，在他们反对压迫和剥削、反对帝国主义的斗争中，决定性的因素仍是：社会主义的力量遵循一个基本方向行动，并且团结在苏联共产党的周围。
    居约在结束报告时建议在全国开展筹备庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的活动，以再次显示法国劳动人民同苏联的传统友谊和团结一致。
    全会还通过了关于从2月25日至3月3日举行争取阿尔及利亚和平的斗争周的决议。
    全会成立了法国共产党党史编纂委员会。
