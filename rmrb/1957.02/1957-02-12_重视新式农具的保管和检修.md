    Emphasize the Safekeeping and Repair of New-Style Farm Tools
    Zeng Yingquan
    New-style farm tools are becoming more and more common in rural areas. In recent years, supply and marketing cooperatives have provided agricultural cooperatives with more than 1.4 million double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows, and more than 120,000 seeders, harvesters, disc harrows, and spike-tooth harrows. In addition, there are a large number of new-style water lifting tools. Doing a good job of safekeeping and repairing, and preserving the performance and quality of these farm tools, is an important preparatory task before spring plowing and sowing.
    In many areas, agricultural cooperatives are doing a very poor job of safekeeping and maintaining new-style farm tools. Some agricultural cooperatives throw double-furrow plows around randomly; some plows have rusted, and some parts have been lost. Some agricultural cooperatives leave used new-style farm tools in the fields, exposed to the sun and rain. Still other agricultural cooperatives take the angle iron off the seeders to weigh down sheds, and take the wooden drawbars off to make large cart frames. Some people think: new-style farm tools are loaned by the state, and anyway the cooperative didn't pay cash to buy them, so it doesn't matter if they get damaged. Obviously, this kind of thinking and practice is very wrong.
    Another reason why new-style farm tools are not being properly kept is that in many areas, there is nowhere to repair farm tools when they break down, and nowhere to find replacement parts when they are lost. Farmers think that keeping damaged farm tools is like keeping a pile of scrap iron. Although this is an old problem, it has not been completely resolved for a long time. Last year, in Henan Province, about 10,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows could not be used due to missing or damaged parts. Nanyang and Neixiang counties in this province inspected 832 double-furrow plows, of which 230 were waiting to be repaired due to missing or damaged parts, accounting for 27.6%. In other areas, the repair and parts supply work has not kept up closely, which has also hindered their use to some extent. Therefore, as spring plowing is approaching, supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in various places should also pay special attention to this work, and help agricultural cooperatives to conduct an inspection of the existing new-style farm tools, and repair the farm tools that have lost parts or are worn out. For some large new-style farm tools (such as harvesters and seeders) that cannot be repaired by handicraft cooperatives due to limited technology and equipment, local machinery factories (or iron factories) should help solve this problem. In terms of repair work, every possible convenience should be provided to agricultural cooperatives for repairing farm tools, and a combination of fixed repair and door-to-door mobile repair can be adopted. During the preparatory period for spring plowing, more mobile repair methods can be adopted.
    Of course, while doing a good job of safekeeping and repairing new-style farm tools, the safekeeping and repair of old-style farm tools must not be neglected.
    The spring plowing season is getting closer and closer. Doing a good job of safekeeping and repairing farm tools, so that the existing farm tools can be put into spring plowing production in a timely manner, is a matter of utmost urgency!

    重视新式农具的保管和检修
    曾映泉
    各地农村里的新式农具越来越多了。几年来，供销合作社系统已供应给农业社双轮双（单）铧犁一百四十多万部，播种机、收割机、圆盘耙、钉齿耙等十二万多部。此外还有大批的新式提水工具。做好保管和检修工作，保全这些农具的性能和质量，是春耕播种前的一项重要的准备工作。
    不少地区的农业社对新式农具的保管保养是做得很差的。某些农业社把双铧犁随意乱扔，有的犁已经生锈，有的零件已经丢失。某些农业社将使用过的新式农具放在田里，任凭日晒雨淋。还有些农业社把播种机上的三角铁拆下来压棚子，把木拉杆拆下来做大车架子。有的人认为：新式农具是国家贷给的，反正社里没有拿现款去买，搞坏了不算什么。显然，这种想法和作法是很不对的。
    新式农具保管不好的另一个原因是：不少地区农具坏了无处修，零件丢了无处配；农民认为，保管损坏的农具，等于保管了一堆废铁。这虽然是一个老问题，但是很久以来却没有得到彻底的解决。去年河南省推广的双轮双铧犁，因缺损零件不能使用的约有一万部左右。这个省的南阳、内乡两县检查了八百三十二部双铧犁，其中因缺损待修的有二百三十部，占27.6％。其他地区由于修配和零件供应工作没有紧紧地跟上去，也在一定程度上妨碍了使用。因此，在春耕快要到来的时候，各地供销社和手工业社也应当特别重视这个工作，帮助农业社把现有的新式农具进行一次检查，对已经丢缺零件和磨损的农具加以修补。手工业社因技术、设备等条件所限，不能修配的某些大型的新式农具（如收割机、播种机），地方机械工厂（或铁工厂）应当帮助解决这个问题。在修配工作上，应当尽可能给农业社修配农具以便利，可以采取固定修配和下乡巡回修配相结合的方式。在备耕期间，可以多采取下乡流动修配的办法。
    当然，在做好新式农具的保管和检修工作的同时，对旧式农具的保管和修理也绝不可忽视。
    春耕时节越来越近，把农具的保管和检修工作做好，使已有的农具能适时投入春耕生产，是一件刻不容缓的事情了！
