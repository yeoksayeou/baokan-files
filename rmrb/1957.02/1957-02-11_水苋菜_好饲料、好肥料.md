    Water Amaranth - Good Fodder, Good Fertilizer
    Liu Xingqun
    Farmers in Shangyu, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Xiaoshan, and Jiaxing counties in Zhejiang Province have discovered a wild aquatic plant called water amaranth in recent years. This aquatic plant can be used as both fertilizer and pig feed. Many agricultural cooperatives are now cultivating it artificially.
    Water amaranth, also known as hollow amaranth, bean vine grass, and water arhat, is a perennial herbaceous plant of the genus *Ludwigia* in the family Onagraceae. It has a very strong reproductive capacity and can grow in both fields and on water surfaces, especially in shallow water in lakes, marshes, and riverbanks. According to a survey, the area of artificially cultivated water amaranth in a certain place in the Ningbo Special Zone of Zhejiang Province reached 30 million mu last year.
    Water amaranth reproduces quickly and has a high yield, making it ideal for artificial cultivation. Generally, each mu of water surface can yield about 1,200 dan of fresh water amaranth per year. It is rich in nutrients, contains a lot of organic matter, and has a stable fertilizer effect. According to an analysis by the East China Agricultural Science Institute, every 100 jin of water amaranth contains 2.15 jin of nitrogen, 0.84 jin of phosphorus, and 8.39 jin of potassium, which is not lower than the fertilizer effect of the green manure crop milk vetch (every 100 jin of milk vetch contains 2.25 jin of nitrogen, 0.84 jin of phosphorus, and 1.17 jin of potassium). Its nutritional value is also quite high. After a farm in the Ningbo Special Zone used water amaranth as green fodder for pigs, the piglets grew well; the newborn piglets weighed as much as 3.5 jin; before water amaranth was used as feed, the newborn piglets only weighed 2.5 jin. After the Youyi Agricultural Cooperative in Sanlian Township, Shangyu County, used water amaranth to feed pigs, the weight gain of each pig increased from 10 liang to 14 liang per day.
    To cultivate water amaranth artificially, it is necessary to select a suitable water surface; it is best to choose ponds, lakes, or river ends with a lot of sewage and fertile water quality. The general breeding time is from April to September; however, water amaranth used as fertilizer for paddy fields and feed for livestock is best propagated between Grain Rain and Beginning of Summer. Wild water amaranth can be used as seed grass; when the old vines sprout new buds to a length of two or three inches, they can be cut off from the old roots with a sickle for use. About 20 dan of seed grass are needed per mu. In order to make the seed grass evenly distributed on the water surface and not drift with the wind, bamboo or wooden stakes can be driven into the water (the distance between the stakes is about one zhang), and then the seed grass can be tied sequentially to thick straw ropes, and then the straw ropes can be tied to the stakes. The management of water amaranth is relatively simple. During the growth period of the seed grass, the stems are relatively tender, so attention should be paid to prevent ducks from trampling on them, so as to avoid breaking the young buds; in case of strong winds, prevent the enclosure rope from being broken by the wind and blowing the water amaranth away; it is best to frequently introduce sewage or apply some river mud as fertilizer for the water amaranth; remove algae and other weeds on the water surface in time; if fish are also raised in the pond, a certain amount of water surface should be left to facilitate the life of the fish.
    If water amaranth is used as fertilizer, it is generally sown around the Beginning of Summer and can be harvested twice a year. The first harvest is between Minor Heat and Major Heat, which can be used for topdressing of intercropped late rice and single-season late japonica rice or as base fertilizer for continuous cropping of late rice. The second harvest is before Frost's Descent, which is used as fertilizer for rapeseed spring flowering fields, or piled up for early rice base fertilizer in the spring of the following year. When used as fertilizer, it is best to mix it with river mud to make compost. According to the experience of farmers in Shaoxing, 20 dan of fresh water amaranth grass can be mixed with 40 dan of river mud. When piling up, first dry the cut water amaranth in the sun for one or two days to soften it, and then pile it up layer by layer with a layer of water amaranth and a layer of river mud, and compact it. In hot weather, it usually takes about seven days, and in cold weather, it takes about fifteen to twenty days to decompose and be applied. If it is used as pig feed, the tender shoots can be cut off at any time according to the growth of the water amaranth, washed, cooked, and then fed to pigs.
    Although water amaranth can be used as both fertilizer and feed, I think it is better to use it to feed pigs first. Because pigs can gain weight by eating water amaranth, and the manure they excrete is still the best fertilizer, which is a double benefit. I hope that agricultural cooperatives across the country will cultivate water amaranth artificially in order to solve the problem of fertilizer and feed shortages. Especially in the southern provinces, there are many ponds, and there is a broader prospect for cultivating water amaranth. (Attached picture)

### 水苋菜——好饲料、好肥料

    水苋菜——好饲料、好肥料
    刘醒群
    浙江省上虞、绍兴、余姚、萧山和嘉兴等县农民，近年来发现了一种野生水草——水苋菜。这种水草既可作肥料，又可作猪饲料。目前许多农业合作社正在用人工来繁殖它。
    水苋菜又叫空心苋、豆藤草、水萝汉等，是千屈菜科水苋菜属的多年生宿根草本植物。它的繁殖力极强，无论在地里或水面都能生长；特别喜欢长在湖沼、河边的浅水中。据调查，去年浙江省宁波专区一个地方人工培养的水苋菜，就有三千万亩。
    水苋菜繁殖快，产量高，极宜于人工培养。通常每亩水面，每年可以采鲜水苋菜一千二百担左右。它的肥分丰富，含有机质多，肥效稳定。据华东农业科学研究所分析：每一百斤水苋菜，含有氮素二点一五斤，磷素零点八四斤，钾素八点三九斤，不比绿肥作物紫云英的肥效低（紫云英每百斤含氮素二点二五斤，磷素零点八四斤，钾素一点一七斤）。它的营养价值也相当高。宁波专区农场用水苋菜作猪的青饲料后，小猪生长良好，初生的小猪，大的有三斤半重；在未用水苋菜做饲料以前，初生的小猪只有二斤半重。上虞县三联乡友谊农业社，用水苋菜喂猪以后，每头猪从原来每天长肉十两增加到十四两。
    用人工培养水苋菜，先要选择适当的水面；最好选用污水多、水质较肥的池塘、湖沼或河头河尾等地方。一般繁殖时间是从4月到9月；但作为水稻肥料和家畜饲料用的水苋菜以谷雨至立夏间繁殖为最好。可用野生的水苋菜作种草；当老藤嫩芽抽发到二、三寸长的时候，就可以用镰刀把它从老根处割下来使用。每亩需种草二十担左右。为了使种草在水面分布均匀，不随风飘流，可在水中打上竹桩或木桩（桩和桩间的距离约一丈左右），然后把种草顺次结在粗的草绳上，再把草绳缚在桩上就行了。水苋菜的管理比较简单，在种草生长期间，茎杆比较幼嫩，应注意防止放鸭践踏，以免折伤嫩芽；遇大风的时候要防止围绳被风吹断，把水苋菜刮走；最好经常引入污水或拨些河泥作水苋菜的肥料；及时清除水面上的青苔等杂草；池塘内如果同时养鱼，要空出一定的水面，以利鱼的生活。
    水苋菜如果作肥料用，一般在立夏前后下种，一年可收二次。第一次在小暑至大暑间收获，可供间作晚稻和单季晚粳追肥或连作晚稻基肥用。第二次在霜降前收草，供油菜春花田作肥料用，或堆到第二年春天作早稻基肥用。作肥料用，最好先混和河泥，制成堆肥。根据绍兴农民的经验，二十担水苋菜鲜草，可混河泥四十担。堆积的时候，先把割来的水苋菜晒一、二天，使它变软，然后用一层水苋菜一层河泥，层层堆积起来，压实。在热天通常约经过七天，冷天经过十五至二十天左右就可腐熟施用了。如果作猪饲料用，可根据水苋菜生长情形，随时割取嫩梢，经洗净煮熟后喂猪。
    水苋菜虽然既可做肥料又可做饲料，但我认为还是先用来喂猪好。因为猪吃了水苋菜既可以长肉，它所排出的粪尿仍然是最好的肥料，一举两得。希望全国各地农业合作社多多用人工培养水苋菜，以便解决肥料和饲料缺乏的问题。特别是南方各省，水塘很多，培养水苋菜更有广阔的前途。（附图片）
