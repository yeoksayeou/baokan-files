Reactions to Criticism

    Letter from the General Office of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China: The People's Daily on February 5th reprinted the Jiangxi Daily article "A Work Group That Only Talks About 'Nutrition'" on page four, which criticized Comrade Wang Dou, Director of the Confidential Communication Bureau of the Provincial Committee, and Comrade Sun Rugang, Head of the Document Receiving and Dispatching Section of the Secretariat of the General Office of the Provincial Committee. This shows that our ideological education work for cadres has been very insufficient. We will strengthen ideological leadership in the future and educate cadres to establish a hardworking and simple working style.
    At the same time, we have criticized and educated the above two comrades and ordered them to make self-criticisms at the general meeting of the branch. In their self-criticisms, they expressed their acceptance of the criticism and their commitment to correct their mistakes.
    Letter from the People's Committee Office of Changshan County: The People's Daily published an article on January 8 entitled "A Large Theater in a Small County Town," criticizing the county's newly built theater for failing to grasp the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, resulting in extravagance and waste. We believe this criticism is correct. We have ordered the Bureau of Culture and Education and relevant personnel to conduct a deep self-criticism.

    对批评的反应
    中共江西省委办公厅来信：2月5日人民日报第四版转载江西日报的“一个专讲‘营养’的下乡工作组”一文对省委机要交通局长王斗和省委办公厅秘书处文书收发科长孙汝光同志作了批评，这说明我们平时对干部的思想教育工作是作得很不够的，我们将在今后加强思想领导，教育干部树立艰苦朴素的工作作风。
    同时，我们对上述两个同志进行了批评教育，责成他们在支部大会上作了检讨，他们的检讨中表示接受批评，改正错误。
    常山县人民委员会办公室来信：1月8日人民日报登载的“小县城的大戏院”一文，批评我县新建戏院未掌握增产节约精神，造成铺张浪费。我们认为这一批评是正确的。我们已责成文教局和有关人员作深刻检讨。
