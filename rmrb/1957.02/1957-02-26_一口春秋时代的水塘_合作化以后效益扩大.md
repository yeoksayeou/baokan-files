Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 22nd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lin Mu reports: The Anfeng Pond in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, is a water storage and irrigation project built by the working people of our country during the Spring and Autumn Period. After cooperativization, Anfeng Pond has exerted its unprecedented irrigation efficiency. Last year alone, the three large advanced cooperatives around it, such as Aiguo and Wuxing, expanded irrigation to more than 100,000 mu of land, achieving large-scale bumper harvests.

　　Anfeng Pond is a vast depression surrounded by a forty-li long embankment. The water surface of this pond is about 60,000 mu, and during the flood season in summer, the water surface is up to 160,000 mu. There are more than 70 sluice gates around the pond to regulate the irrigation of the pond water. However, in the era of small-scale peasant economy, the irrigation efficiency of Anfeng Pond could not be fully utilized. For example, the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative next to Anfeng Pond used to suffer from drought and crop failure on more than 25,000 mu of land for years when they were farming individually. However, it was impossible to dig ditches in anyone's fields to divert Anfeng Pond water to irrigate the farmland. The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative used to have 60,000 mu of drought-stricken farmland, but they were 15 li away from Anfeng Pond, so they couldn't even think about diverting water for irrigation. Therefore, in the past, when there was a drought, the peasants could only watch their crops dry up and die in vain.

　　Last year, agricultural cooperativization was realized around Anfeng Pond, and this situation completely changed. The cooperatives around Anfeng Pond gave full play to the advantages of unified land use, and successively opened canals to divert water to irrigate farmland. For example, the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative built five diversion canals and three small reservoirs, diverting Anfeng Pond water to expand irrigation to more than 25,000 mu of farmland, and also converted 5,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative and the Gedian Township Advanced Cooperative, which is close to Anfeng Pond, jointly cooperated to open a 15-li long diversion canal, irrigating more than 70,000 mu of land in the two cooperatives.

    一口春秋时代的水塘
    合作化以后效益扩大
    新华社合肥22日电　新华社记者林牧报道：安徽寿县的安丰塘，是我国春秋时代劳动人民建筑起来的蓄水灌溉工程。在合作化后，安丰塘发挥了它史无前例的灌溉效能。去年，单是它周围的爱国、五星等三个大型高级社，就扩大灌溉了十万多亩土地，取得大面积丰收。
    安丰塘是一片广阔的洼地由四十里长堤环绕而成的。这个塘的水面约有六万多亩，在夏季蓄洪期间最多时水面有十六万亩。全塘四周有七十多个闸门调节塘水的灌溉。但是在小农经济时代，安丰塘的灌溉效能是没能充分发挥的。像在安丰塘边上的爱国农业社，过去单干时，共约有两万五千多亩土地连年受旱失收，可是要想在谁的田里挖沟，引安丰塘水来灌溉农田都是不行的。五星农业社过去有六万亩受旱的农田，但他们离安丰塘十五华里，更不要想引水灌溉了。所以，过去一到天旱，农民们只好望着焦干了的庄稼，让它白白的死去。
    去年，安丰塘周围实现了农业合作化，这种情况完全改变了。安丰塘周围的合作社充分发挥了土地统一使用的优越性，纷纷开渠引水灌溉农田。像爱国农业社就兴修了五条引水渠，三个小水库，引安丰塘的水扩大灌溉了二万五千多亩农田，还把五千亩旱地改种了水稻。五星农业社和靠近安丰塘的戈店乡高级社，共同合作开了一条长达十五华里的引水渠，灌溉了两个社七万多亩土地。
