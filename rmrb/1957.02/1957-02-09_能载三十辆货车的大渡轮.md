Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 8th. The Jiangnan Shipyard is building a large ferry capable of carrying thirty trucks or fifteen buses at a time. This ferry is being manufactured in one hundred and five sections. Once fully assembled, it will be 118.7 meters long with a displacement of 4,950 tons.

Supervising engineer Yang Zhihua introduced that, according to the planned schedule, this largest train ferry made by our own country can be completed this year and participate in the increasingly busy train transport across the river between Xiaguan in Nanjing and Pukou.

From the blueprints, the ferry's shape resembles an aircraft carrier, with three railway tracks laid on the main deck. It has no bow or stern and has propellers at both ends, powered by two 960-horsepower steam engines each. Each docking or departure from the pier only takes three or four minutes. The engine room and boiler room both have cooling equipment, as well as a complete set of automatic coal-adding equipment. All mechanical equipment, except for three generators that use the original ones, are all domestically produced.

    能载三十辆货车的大渡轮
    新华社上海8日电　江南造船厂正在制造一艘一次能装载三十辆货车或十五辆客车的大渡轮。这艘渡轮分成一百零五段来制造，全部大合拢以后，总长有一百一十八·七公尺，排水量达四千九百五十吨。
    监造工程师杨质花介绍说，按照预定的计划，这艘我国自己制造的最大的火车渡轮，今年可以全部完工，参加南京下关和浦口之间愈来愈繁忙的火车过江运输。
    从蓝图上看，渡轮的外形像航空母舰，主甲板上铺设三条铁道。它分不出船头船尾，两头都有推进器，由两部各有九百六十马力的蒸汽机发动，每次停靠或驶离码头的时间只要三、四分钟。机舱和锅炉舱都有降温设备，还有整套的自动加煤设备。全部机械设备除了三台发电机利用原有的以外，全部是国产的。
