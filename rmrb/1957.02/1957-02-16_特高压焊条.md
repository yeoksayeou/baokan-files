    Extra High Voltage Welding Rod

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Anshan Metal Structure Manufacturing Plant has successfully trial-produced an extra high voltage welding rod. On the 7th, it was used to weld the body of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 blast furnace, and the quality proved to be very good.

    Extra high voltage welding rods have a wide range of uses and can be used to weld components with particularly strong pressure resistance and particularly thick steel, such as boilers, bridges, heavy-duty cranes, and blast furnace bodies. In the past, our country mostly used riveting methods for these components, which were labor-intensive and material-consuming. Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel used extra high voltage welding rods imported from the Soviet Union to weld a blast furnace, which has already shown great advantages.

    After the successful trial production of this welding rod, not only can it save foreign exchange, but by replacing riveting with welding on the three blast furnaces to be built at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, it can save one hundred and eighty tons of steel plate.

    特高压焊条
    新华社讯　特高压焊条已经在鞍山金属结构制造厂试制成功。7日用它来焊接鞍钢三号炼铁炉炉体，证明质量很好。
    特高压焊条用途很广，可以焊接锅炉、桥梁、重型起重机、高炉炉体等耐压力要求特别强、钢材特别厚的构件。这种构件过去我国大都是采用铆接的方法，费工费料较多。去年，鞍钢用从苏联进口的特高压焊条焊接了一座炼铁炉，已经显示出很大优点。
    这种焊条试制成功以后，不但能节约外汇，仅在鞍山钢铁公司、本溪钢铁公司和武汉钢铁公司将要建设的三座炼铁炉上用焊接代替铆接，就可以节约一百八十吨钢板。
