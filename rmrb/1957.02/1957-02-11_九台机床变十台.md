Nine Machine Tools Become Ten
By our reporter Wen Tianshen

    In the past two years, the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory has produced large quantities of the 1K36 hexagonal lathe. In addition to cutting various axle sleeves and gears, this lathe can also drill and bore holes, and cut threads and tapers when equipped with boring attachments. It is therefore suitable for use in many mechanical factories.
    In the third quarter of last year, due to a shortage of steel supply, under the leadership of the Party, the workers made multiple technical improvements and finally proposed a method of producing ten machine tools with the steel used for nine.
    In the past, it took 1,265 kilograms of steel to produce one such lathe, but now it only takes 1,137 kilograms, saving 128 kilograms of steel per machine.
    On the new machine tools, 44 types of parts have had their "blank outer circle allowance" changed, saving 20 kilograms of steel per machine; 60 types of parts have had their "chucking allowance" reduced, saving 15 kilograms of steel per machine; parts that entirely use "sheet metal nesting" save more than 50 kilograms of steel plate per machine. In addition, the widespread adoption of new process regulations, such as "saw blade replacing cutting tool," "nesting processing," "spindle nesting," and "washer part punching," also saves steel for parts in quantities ranging from one to twenty or so.
    Before this, the factory had revised its process regulations more than once, but the results were never good. The problem was either insufficient communication between departments, or inadequate material supply, or a failure to consider the workers' operating conditions. As a result, the technicians complained, and the workers grumbled that the process regulations were impractical and "scraping meat off bones." The new process regulations could not be implemented.
    The leadership noticed this situation and revised the process regulations once again. This time, the revisions were based first on the workers' technical skills and concentrated the wisdom of the masses, and also emphasized that the revisions should be made on the basis of unified understanding between departments and workshops. Therefore, many process procedure revisions were proposed from the bottom up by workers and workshop technical groups. For example, in improving the "nesting processing" process, workers in the Third Workshop proposed that all parts that can be nested with a nesting tool should not be drilled into iron filings with a drill bit; parts that can be processed with a narrow tool should not be cut with a wide tool, and parts that can be cut with a tool should not be shaved into iron filings. This approach was originally the operating experience of advanced workers in the workshop. Technicians helped the workshop workers to master this operation universally, and its implementation was very smooth. For example, Wang Ye'an, a third-grade worker, and two female lathe operators, Liu Jinglan and Wang Huilan (people call them "the Two Lans"), were the proponents of the factory's "nesting processing" process. Wang Ye'an has been using nesting instead of drilling holes for axle sleeve parts for a year. The tool he uses has also been reduced from three centimeters to one and a half centimeters, saving one and a half centimeters of steel material per job. Last year, he saved enough steel in this "nest if possible, narrow if possible" operation to produce half a 1K36 lathe. Similarly, the two female lathe operators, "the Two Lans," learned Wang Ye'an's nesting and cutting techniques and once turned 447 pieces of material into 1,000 pieces. Every piece met the quality standards.
    Of course, this revision of the process regulations not only absorbed the advanced experience of the workshops, but also brought into play the strength of engineering and technical personnel. In the process section, there is a table for revising the process, which the technicians proposed after reviewing all processing parts based on the factory's equipment conditions, material supply, process balancing, and reference to experiences inside and outside the factory. In the past, 55 centimeters of blanks were needed to process 48 centimeter parts, which was a great waste. After research by the process section and the supply and marketing section, it was decided to use 50 centimeter blanks when issuing materials (the blanks produced by steel mills are generally larger than the actual specifications), which is enough for workers to process 48 centimeter jobs. Saving 5 centimeters of coarse steel material from this blank material issuance shows that the factory wasted materials in the past when issuing materials. Now they have considered "using materials according to quantity" and saving every bit. In addition, one of the provisions in the process regulations is to implement "sheet metal nesting," which was originally the experience of the First Mechanical Production Cooperative. Last year, this production cooperative processed for the factory and saved 60 sheets of steel plate by using "sheet metal nesting." This experience attracted the attention of the factory's process engineers and material personnel. After contacting the workshops, they incorporated this "sheet metal nesting" experience into the process regulations based on the characteristics of the parts. At present, after the workers' practice, the factory's utilization rate of sheet metal parts has increased from 65% in the past to 87.9%. Another new process of "mutually serving as chucks," after practice and implementation, proved that a total of 138 types of parts in the workshop can be processed using the "mutually serving as chucks" method. It is estimated that only 15 kilograms of chucks can be saved on the 1K36 lathe. In order to ensure the implementation of various processes, in addition to specifying the content of process revisions on the process forms, they also designated responsible persons and contacted the implementing units, and proposed specific steps for revising material quotas, changing tools and tool bars, design, and manufacturing. This basically changed the past practice of engineering and technical personnel "building cars behind closed doors." On this point, the supply and marketing section and the machining workshop have a deep understanding. For example, not long ago, the supply and marketing section could not grasp the new sheet metal nesting, and the process section immediately organized process engineers to help the storekeepers learn; for example, the processing of parts in the blanking section of the Third Workshop had problems in implementation due to the low level of process technology of the workers. The process section quota group immediately went down to provide guidance to ensure the implementation of the process. The workshop cadres and workers were very satisfied with this.
    In 1957, the factory's material supply still has great difficulties; but the fact that ten machine tools were produced with the steel used for nine has given the factory leadership great courage to overcome the difficulties, indicating that as long as the masses are mobilized, there is a way to save a large amount of steel. At present, in the workshops, many workers, under the education of the Party, have expressed that they must not only save steel but also pay attention to product quality. The workers of the Third Workshop said: "We must always focus on reading blueprints; we must always pay attention to operations." The scrap rate of this workshop has dropped from 2.14% in September last year to 1.8%. In the departments, technical personnel have also put forward the slogan of "using our brains, going deep into reality, and striving to save every ounce of steel." The process section and the forging and metallurgy section have stated that they will strive for more steel savings on the basis of "producing ten machine tools with the steel used for nine" and produce more and better machine tools for the country.

    九台机床变十台
    本报记者　文天申
    近两年来，沈阳第三机床厂大量生产一种1K36六角车床。这种车床除了能切削各种轴套齿轮外，安上镗具附件，还能钻孔镗眼，车削螺纹和斜度。因此适合许多机械工厂使用。
    去年第三季度，由于钢材供应不足，职工们在党的领导下经过了多次技术上的改进，终于提出了用九台机床的钢材生产十台机床的办法。
    过去每生产一台这样的车床需要投入一千二百六十五公斤钢材，而现在每台机床只需投入钢材一千一百三十七公斤，节省了一百二十八公斤钢材。
    在新的机床上，目前有四十四种零件改变了“毛坯外圆余量”，每台机床节约钢材二十公斤；六十种零件削减了“卡切余量”，每台节约钢材十五公斤；全部采用“板金套材”的零件，每台节约钢板五十多公斤。除此以外，广泛采用新工艺规程，如“锯条代切刀”、“套料加工”、“主轴套料”、“垫圈零件冲削”，节约钢材的零件也都在一种到二十种左右。
    在此以前，这个工厂也曾不止一次地修改过工艺规程，但效果总是不好。问题不是科室联系不够，就是物资供应不上，或是没有考虑工人的操作条件，因此，技术人员发牢骚，工人们埋怨工艺规程不切实际，是“从骨头上刮肉”。新的工艺规程推行不了。
    领导方面注意到这个情况，把工艺规程又作了一次修改。这次修改，首先是根据工人的技术水平并集中了群众智慧，还特别强调了要在科室、车间统一认识的基础上进行修改。因此，有许多工艺程序的修改是由工人、车间技术组自下而上讨论提出的。例如改进“套切加工”工艺中，三车间的工人提出：所有加工部件，凡是能用套料刀套的，就不用钻头钻成铁屑；凡是能用窄刀具加工的，就不用宽刀切，凡是能用刀具切的就不把它削成铁片。这种做法，原来就是车间先进工人的操作经验，技术人员帮助车间工人普遍掌握了这种操作，推行起来就很顺利。如三级工王冶安和两个女车工刘静兰、王惠兰（人们叫她们“二兰”），他们就是工厂“套料加工”工艺的提倡者。王冶安在轴套部件加工上，坚持用套料代替钻头钻孔已有一年了。他所用的刀具也从三糎改到一点五糎，每干一个活能节省一点五糎的钢料。去年他在这种“能套不钻、能窄不宽”的操作中节约的钢材，可以生产半台1K36车床。同样，两个女车工“二兰”学习了王冶安的套、切技巧，曾经一次将四百四十七件活的钢材干了一千件。质量件件合格。
    当然，这次修改工艺规程不仅只是吸取车间的先进经验，同时，也发挥了工程技术人员的力量。在工艺科里，有一幅修改工艺的表格，就是技术人员根据工厂设备情况，材料供应，工序平衡，参考厂内外经验并对全部加工零件进行审查提出的。过去加工四十八糎的部件需要五十五糎的毛坯，浪费很大，经工艺科和供销科研究，决定在发料时改用五十糎的毛坯（钢厂生产的毛坯一般要比实际规格大），足够工人加工四十八糎的活。从这种毛坯发料节约五糎粗的钢材，说明工厂过去发料时是有浪费的，现在他们已经考虑到“量材使用”点滴节约了。另外，工艺规程中有一项实行“板金套材”的规定，这原是第一机械生产合作社的经验，去年这个生产合作社为工厂加工，利用“板金套材”节约了六十张钢板。这项经验引起了工厂工艺员和材料员的注意，他们和车间取得联系后，又根据部件的特点，把这种“板金套材”经验订到工艺规程中去。目前，经过工人们的实践，工厂板金件的利用率已从过去的65％提高到87.9％。另一项“互为卡头”的新工艺，经过实践贯彻，证明在车间里共有一百三十八种零件都可采用“互为卡头”的办法进行加工。算起来，仅在1K36车床上，就能节约十五公斤的卡头。为了保证各项工艺的贯彻，他们除了在工艺表格上规定工艺修改内容外，还指定了负责人和执行单位联系，分别提出修改材料定额、改刀具、刀杆、设计、制造等具体步骤。基本上改变了过去工程技术人员“闭门造车”的作法。在这一点上，供销科和机械加工车间体会得较深。例如不久以前，供销科对新的板金套材掌握不了，工艺科马上就组织工艺员帮助保管员进行学习；又如三车间套工段加工部件由于工人的工艺技术水平低，执行中发生问题，工艺科定额组立即下去进行指导，保证了工艺的贯彻。这样作，车间干部和工人都很满意。
    1957年这个工厂的材料供应仍然有很大的困难；但用九台机床的钢材生产十台机床的事实，已给工厂领导上克服困难以很大的勇气，说明只要发动群众，就有办法做到大量地节约钢材。目前，在车间里，许多工人在党的教育下，表示既要节约钢材，又要重视产品质量。三车间的工人们说：“我们要处处着眼看图纸；处处注意搞操作。”这个车间目前的废品率已由去年9月份的2.14％，降低到1.8％。在科室里，技术人员也提出了“开动脑筋，深入实际，为节约每一两钢材而努力”的口号，工艺科、锻冶科纷纷表示要在“九台机床的钢材生产十台机床”的基础上，争取更多的节约钢材，为国家生产出更多更好的机床来。
