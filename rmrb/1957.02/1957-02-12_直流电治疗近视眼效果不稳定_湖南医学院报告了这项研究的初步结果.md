Xinhua News Agency report: Preliminary experiments by the Ophthalmology Research Group of Hunan Medical College indicate that the long-term efficacy of direct current treatment for refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism) is unstable.

The Ophthalmology Research Group of Hunan Medical College has been studying this issue for nearly six months. Professor Zhang Junjie, who is in charge of this research, reported the preliminary results of the study at the first scientific paper report conference of Hunan Medical College. Zhang Junjie said: The short-term efficacy of direct current treatment for refractive errors is significant. According to statistics from 800 eyes with myopia and myopic astigmatism that received more than ten treatments, the vision of 72% of the eyes improved to varying degrees in a short period. However, after tracking and observing 317 eyes of 160 people who responded effectively to the treatment, it was found that most had varying degrees of regression; some regressed to the vision level before treatment; and the longer the time, the greater the regression. After four to six months of treatment, 90.5% had varying degrees of regression; and 42% regressed to the vision level before treatment. After two to four months of treatment, 81.4% regressed. The refractive power of 139 eyes was measured before direct current treatment and after the treatment was effective. There was no change in the refractive power of these eyes after the treatment was effective. Therefore, it can be explained that the effect of direct current treatment for refractive errors is not local to the eyeball. In addition, this research group also used ringtones or other environmental conditions to establish conditioned reflexes in the treated subjects, and found that vision could also be improved by using only conditioned stimuli without electrotherapy. Zhang Junjie said: Analyzing the materials obtained from the experimental research, it is preliminarily believed that the effect of direct current treatment on refractive errors of the eyes lies in the fact that weak current can excite the visual cells in the visual area of ​​the cerebral cortex; enhance visual function and improve vision. However, how to make this effect last still needs further research.

    直流电治疗近视眼效果不稳定
    湖南医学院报告了这项研究的初步结果
    据新华社讯　湖南医学院眼科教研组的初步实验说明：直流电治疗屈光不正（近视、远视、散光）的远期疗效不稳定。
    湖南医学院眼科教研组对这个问题进行了近六个月的研究。主持这项研究工作的张俊杰教授在湖南医学院第一届科学论文报告会上，报告了这项研究的初步结果。张俊杰说：用直流电治疗屈光不正的近期疗效是显著的。根据治疗十次以上的八百只近视和近视散光的眼睛统计，有72％的眼睛的视力在短时期内有不同程度的进步。但经过对治疗有效的一百六十人的三百十七只眼睛的追踪观察后，发现大多有不同程度的退步；有的退步到治疗前的视力；时间越久退步越大。治疗后经过四到六个月的，90.5％有不同程度退步；并有42％退步到治疗前的视力。治疗后经过两到四个月的，退步的占81.4％。一百三十九只眼睛在直流电治疗前和治疗获效后都被测定过屈光度，这些眼睛在治疗获效后的屈光度并无改变。因此，可以说明直流电治疗屈光不正的作用不在眼球局部。此外，这个教研组还用铃声或其他环境条件给被治疗者建立条件反射，发现仅用条件刺激而不用电疗，也可以使视力进步。张俊杰说：分析了实验研究所得到的材料，初步认为直流电治疗眼睛屈光不正的作用，在于微弱电流可使大脑皮层视区的视细胞兴奋；使视功能增强，视力进步。但如何使这种作用持久，尚待进一步研究。
