Strengthening Education for Party Members According to Local Conditions and Times
An Education Network for Party Members Formed in Rural Anhui

(Our dispatch) The Party organizations at all levels in Anhui have strengthened their leadership in the education of rural Party members and have taken some effective measures. Great achievements have been made in the education of rural Party members in the past year, and an education network for Party members has basically been formed in rural areas throughout the province.

In the past year, the Party's grassroots organizations in various rural areas have generally established a Party lesson education system according to the specific conditions and characteristics of the locality and in accordance with local conditions and times. According to incomplete statistics from five special districts, including Wuhu, Anqing, Fuyang, Bengbu, and Lu'an, and five suburban districts of cities, including Hefei, 82% of the rural grassroots Party organizations have established a Party lesson education system. Various localities have also equipped 12,811 Party lesson instructors, so that most branches have instructors. In terms of lesson preparation, many areas have adopted methods such as concentrating instructors in the county or sending people to conduct roving guidance in different areas to specifically help instructors with lesson preparation. The propaganda departments of the seven county committees in Lu'an Special District generally conducted five to seven centralized lesson preparation sessions each year for Party member cadres who were detached from production and served as Party lesson instructors. Because the rural Party organizations in various localities have established a Party lesson education system, in the past year, in addition to systematically conducting basic Party knowledge education for Party members through Party lessons, they have also closely combined with the central tasks of the Party in various periods to conduct education on the Party's guidelines, policies, and tasks for Party members; in combination with Party rectification and Party building work, they have conducted education on the standards of Party members and how to be a Communist Party member; after the Party's Eighth National Congress, Party organizations in various localities organized rural Party members to study the "Eighth National Congress" documents through dissemination, reports, lectures, and other forms. According to statistics from ten counties in Fuyang Special District, more than 38,000 rural Party members participated in the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents, accounting for approximately 79% of the total number of rural Party members in the entire special district. Because of the strengthening of education for Party members, the vast majority of rural Party members have brought their enthusiasm into play and have played a core role in completing various tasks of the Party and the state, thereby further strengthening the Party's leadership over rural work. Guangming Cooperative in Shilitao Township, Dingyuan County, has a total of 78 Party members. In 1955, due to the relative weakness of Party member education work, six Party members committed relatively serious mistakes and were subject to Party disciplinary action. In 1956, they adhered to regular Party lesson education, and the ideological awareness of Party members was greatly improved. Not only did no Party members commit serious mistakes, but 21 Party members were rated as models at the district and county levels, and 13 Party members attended the county and provincial socialist construction activist conferences.

At the same time, Party organizations in various localities have cultivated a large number of activists through training, lessons, and other educational methods, ensuring the quality of developing new Party members. In 1956, the rural Party organizations in Anhui Province developed greatly, with more than 160,000 outstanding elements being admitted into the Party, and the vast majority of them met the standards of Party members.

    因地因时制宜加强对党员的教育
    安徽农村形成党员教育网
    本报讯　安徽各级党组织加强了对农村党员教育工作的领导，采取了一些有效的措施，一年来农村党员教育工作取得了很大的成绩，基本上在全省农村范围内形成了党员教育网。
    去年一年来，各地农村中党的基层组织，根据当地的具体条件和特点，因地因时制宜较普遍地建立了党课教育制度，据芜湖、安庆、阜阳、蚌埠、六安等五个专区和合肥市等五个市郊区的不完全统计，已经建立党课教育制度的占农村基层党组织总数的82％，各地并配备了党课教员一万二千八百十一名，使绝大部分支部都有了教员。在备课方面，不少地区采用了将教员集中到县或派人分片巡回辅导等方法，具体帮助教员进行备课工作。六安专区七个县委宣传部在去年一年内，对脱离生产的党员干部担任党课教员的，一般都做了集中备课五次到七次。由于各地农村党组织建立了党课教育制度，一年来除通过上党课对党员比较系统地进行党的基础知识教育外，还密切结合党的各个时期的中心任务，对党员进行了关于党的方针、政策和任务的教育；结合整党建党工作进行了党员的标准和怎样做一个共产党员的教育；党的全国第八次代表大会后，各地党组织通过传达、报告、讲座等形式，组织农村党员学习“八大”文件。据阜阳专区十个县的统计，参加学习“八大”文件的农村党员有三万八千多人，约占全专区农村党员总数的79％；由于加强了对党员的教育，绝大部分农村党员发挥了积极性，在完成党和国家的各项任务中，都发挥了核心作用，因而进一步加强了党对农村工作的领导。定远县十里陶乡光明社共有七十八名党员，1955年由于党员教育工作比较薄弱，就有六个党员犯了比较严重的错误，受到党纪处分；1956年坚持了经常的党课教育，党员的思想觉悟有了很大提高，不仅没有一个党员犯严重的错误，而且有二十一名党员被评为区、县级模范，并有十三名党员出席了县、省社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    同时，各地党组织通过训练、上课等教育方法，培养了大批积极分子，保证了发展新党员的质量。1956年安徽省农村党组织有了很大发展，约有十六万多名优秀分子被吸收到党内来，绝大部分都合乎党员的标准。
