Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 24th - Egyptian Intelligence Chief Hatem stated on the evening of February 23rd that the Egyptian government had not reached any new agreements regarding the duties or status of the United Nations Emergency Force, other than the agreement reached in November of last year concerning the United Nations Emergency Force.

Hatem made these remarks while commenting on UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's speech to the UN General Assembly on February 22nd. Hammarskjöld had said that the Egyptian government was willing to allow the United Nations Emergency Force to be stationed in the Gaza Strip.

Hatem said that the agreement in November of last year stipulated that the responsibilities of the United Nations Emergency Force were to stop fighting and supervise the withdrawal of Israeli troops to behind the 1949 armistice line. The stationing of the United Nations Emergency Force in Egypt and their responsibilities should be subject to the consent of the Egyptian government and should be consistent with the principle of maintaining Egyptian sovereignty.

He also said that Egypt firmly demands the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops behind the armistice line and that aggressors should not be rewarded for launching aggression.

    埃及情报司长声明
    联合国部队在埃职责无变动
    不应让以色列从侵略中得到报酬
    新华社开罗24日电　埃及情报司司长哈特姆23日晚上说，除了去年11月达成的关于联合国紧急部队的协议以外，埃及政府并没有就联合国紧急部队的职责或者地位达成任何新的协议。
    哈特姆是在就联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德22日在联合国大会上的发言发表意见时这样说的。哈马舍尔德曾经说，埃及政府愿意让联合国紧急部队进驻加沙地带。
    哈特姆说，去年11月的协议规定，联合国紧急部队的职责在于制止战斗并且监督以色列军队撤退到1949年停战线后面去。关于联合国紧急部队的驻在埃及以及它们的职责，都应该取得埃及政府的同意，并且应该是同维持埃及主权的原则相一致的。
    他还说，埃及坚决要求以色列军队无条件地撤退到停战线后面去，不应该让侵略者由于发动侵略而得到报酬。
