Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 20th: A small iron smelting plant with an annual output of approximately 40,000 tons of pig iron will be built in Shaoxing, the hometown of Lu Xun. The industrial departments of Shanghai and Zhejiang Province have already started preparations for jointly running this new enterprise, and strive to put it into production in July this year.

Cooperating with other provinces to build small iron smelting plants is a new measure taken by Shanghai's local heavy industry departments this year to overcome the difficulty of insufficient pig iron supply. Not long ago, Shanghai sent people to Zhejiang and other places to investigate the local iron ore reserves and the production of native iron. Building an iron smelting plant in the Shaoxing area to smelt the locally mined hematite ore sand only requires a small investment, and it can be put into production in a very short period of time.

    鲁迅故乡建炼铁厂
    据新华社上海20日电　鲁迅的故乡——绍兴，将要兴建一个年产约四万吨生铁的小型炼铁厂。上海市和浙江省的工业部门已经开始了合办这个新企业的筹备工作，争取在今年7月份投入生产。
    同外省合作兴建小型炼铁厂，是上海地方重工业部门今年克服生铁供应不足困难的一项新措施。不久前，上海曾派人去浙江等地调查当地铁矿蕴藏和土铁生产的情况。在绍兴地区兴建炼铁厂冶炼当地原来开采的赤铁矿矿砂，只需要很少的投资，在很短的时期内就可以投入生产。
