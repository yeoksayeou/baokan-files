This newspaper reports from Nanjing on the 11th: Suzhou and Wuxi in Jiangsu province are actively taking various measures to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw material supply. Some industrial raw materials that were originally quite scarce have now been largely secured.

As early as the fourth quarter of last year, Suzhou and Wuxi actively grasped the work of raw material supply. The industrial leadership departments of the two cities first explained the situation of insufficient raw material supply to the relevant factories, encouraging them to find ways to overcome the difficulties themselves. At the same time, they strengthened ideological education in increasing production and practicing economy, hard struggle, and overall concept in various factories, guiding factories to organize cooperation, take the initiative to connect, and support each other. Each factory was required to make its raw material sources and reserves public to each other, without blocking or keeping secrets, so that raw materials could be fully utilized and used according to their quantity and quality. In addition, the industrial leadership departments of Suzhou and Wuxi also carried out unified allocation and balance of major raw materials. Due to the timely adoption of the above measures, the two cities avoided the artificial tension phenomenon of "open and secret struggles" in raw material supply.

Suzhou and Wuxi adopted the following specific and effective methods to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw material supply:

Closely contact industrial and commercial departments, support each other, and cooperate hand in hand. In the past, factories in the light industrial system of Suzhou City only cared about production and not about raw materials. The required raw materials completely relied on the supply of commercial departments. Therefore, production plans were often changed temporarily due to the disconnection of raw material supply. Because the commercial departments did not understand the actual situation of raw material use, reserves, and mutual adjustment between factories, supply work was also difficult. This created a phenomenon of mutual distrust and "holding back" between industry and commerce. This time, the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee convened a meeting of responsible persons from industrial and commercial departments, which made both sides realize the significance of mutual cooperation and mutual support, and eliminated the phenomenon of mutual "buck-passing" and estrangement. The Suzhou Chemical Company actively tried to find a substitute, electrical bakelite powder, from Jinan for the thirty tons of bakelite powder needed by the Suzhou Button Factory in the first quarter, guaranteeing the factory's production tasks for more than a month. After the raw material problem was solved, the industrial departments actively produced various products that were out of stock in the market for the commercial departments to sell. The Suzhou Chemical Factory decided to produce more than 20 new products this year, such as glass fiber, color ink, and fresh flower essential oil, to meet market needs.

Organize cadres engaged in supply and marketing work in various factories to sort out the raw materials of various products one by one, and organize unified purchases from other places in a guided manner. Suzhou and Wuxi adopted this measure, which not only played the role of unified organization and planned procurement, but also gave play to the enthusiasm of the supply and marketing staff of various factories. They no longer cared only about their own factories and not about the needs of other factories, as in the past, but used close cooperation and mutual adjustment to solve the problem of raw material supply. The Suzhou Municipal Light Industry Bureau has already listed the main materials needed by each factory and organized more than 70 purchasing personnel familiar with the business and technology to go out for procurement. When purchasing personnel cannot buy the specified raw materials, each factory purchases substitutes according to the principle of using materials according to their quantity and quality, and on the premise of not affecting the quality. For example, the soda ash used to produce baking soda in Suzhou is very scarce, so the purchasing personnel went to the Northeast to buy a natural alkali (earth alkali) for substitution. When both raw materials and substitutes are lacking, each factory considers producing new varieties according to the equipment conditions, and then purchases relevant raw materials.

Organize cooperation, exchange what is needed, and strive for processing with supplied materials. Factories in Suzhou and Wuxi, especially the newly established joint state-private enterprises last year, have successively restored historical cooperative relations. Each factory, and even factories in other places, maintain and establish processing relationships based on the principles of mutual benefit and possibility. For example, small hardware factories in Suzhou and Wuxi lack copper, so they established a processing relationship with hardware factories in Shanghai, so that production can continue according to plan. In terms of exchanging what is needed, for example, Suzhou City needs 29 tons of "chlorosulfonic acid," the raw material for manufacturing saccharin, in the first quarter, but this raw material is very scarce domestically. A state-owned factory in Shanghai has a surplus of five tons of "chlorosulfonic acid" every month, but urgently needs "para-xylene." After the exchange, both sides were satisfied. Various factories also actively strive for processing with supplied materials. For example, the 60-horsepower gas engine produced by the Wuxi Power Machine Factory uses raw materials provided by the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau.

Conditionally change product design, reduce raw material consumption quotas, mobilize the masses to collect waste materials, and use substitutes to save raw materials. The Wuxi Municipal Mechanical Industry System attaches particular importance to promoting advanced experience in saving raw materials. Some factories have studied and modified the machine structure, reducing the weight of materials used on the principle of ensuring machine performance. The 12-inch water pump manufactured by the Wuxi Water Pump Factory weighs 1,050 kilograms per unit. The workers devised a way to save the base and the inlet elbow, which can save 254 kilograms of raw materials per water pump. The material used to make three units can now make four units. Currently, the workers are also trial-producing Shenyang-style water pumps. If the trial production is successful, each unit can save 745 kilograms of material. Based on an annual production of 185 units, more than 137 tons of materials can be saved. In addition, the copper elbows on the water pumps are now replaced with pig iron, which can save 8 kilograms of copper per unit. From the fourth quarter of last year to the first ten days of January this year, the Wuxi Rubber Factory used more than 270 tons of various waste rubber to manufacture six kinds of rubber products. In addition, giving full play to the enthusiasm of private personnel has also expanded the scope of raw material procurement. Because some private personnel are familiar with the business and have many old relationships, they can find ways to purchase some unpopular goods and scarce raw materials.

After this series of efforts, the tense situation of raw material supply in Suzhou and Wuxi at the beginning of the year has begun to ease. More than 90% of the raw materials needed by the chemical, papermaking, and small hardware factories in Suzhou City in the first quarter can be supplied, so the annual production plans of each factory are more reliable, and the production plan of the city's light industrial system this year can increase by 20% compared with last year's actual performance. The factories under the Wuxi Municipal First Industrial Bureau may also exceed last year's production level this year because they have overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw material supply.

    互相支持　统一采购　加强协作　厉行节约
    地方工业克服原材料的困难有办法
    苏州、无锡绝大部分原材料有了着落，为实现生产计划创造了条件
    本报南京11电　江苏省苏州、无锡两市积极采取各种措施，克服原材料供应不足的困难。本来比较困难的一些工业原材料，绝大部分都有了着落。
    早在去年第四季度，苏州、无锡两市就积极抓紧原材料的供应工作。两市的工业领导部门，首先将原材料供应不足的情况向各有关工厂说明，鼓励工厂自己想办法克服困难；同时在各工厂中加强关于增产节约、艰苦奋斗和整体观念的思想教育工作，引导各工厂组织协作、主动联系、互相支持。要求各工厂把原材料来源和储备情况互相公开，不封锁，不保密，使原材料能够充分得到利用，而且能够量材使用。此外，苏州、无锡两市的工业领导部门还对主要原材料进行了统一调配和平衡。由于及时采取上述措施，两市就避免了原材料供应中“明争暗夺”的人为紧张现象。
    苏州、无锡两市在克服原材料供应不足的困难中，采用了下面几种具体有效的办法：
    密切工商部门的联系，相互支持，携手协作。苏州市轻工业系统的工厂，过去只管生产，不管原材料，所需原材料完全依赖商业部门供应，因此经常由于原材料供应脱节，临时改变生产计划。商业部门由于不了解工厂原材料使用、储备和厂与厂间互相调剂的实际情况，供应工作也有困难。因此，造成了工商双方互不信任、各“留一手”的现象。这次中共苏州市委和市人民委员会召开了工商部门负责人碰头会议，使工商双方一致认识到互相合作和互相支持的意义，消除了工商双方互相“扯皮”和彼此隔阂的现象。苏州市化工系统的工厂第一季度生产所需要的六十种化工原料，就有三十种由化工公司供应，三十种由各厂自己设法找到。苏州钮扣厂第一季度需要胶木粉三十吨，化工公司就积极想办法，从济南找到代用品电器胶木粉，保证了这个工厂一个多月的生产任务。工业部门在原材料问题解决以后，也就积极生产各种市场上脱销的产品，供应商业部门销售。苏州化工厂决定今年上半年生产玻璃纤维、彩色油墨、鲜花精油等二十多种新产品，以满足市场需要。
    组织各工厂的供销工作的干部，对各种产品的原材料进行逐个排队，有领导地统一向外地采购。苏州、无锡两市采取了这一措施，不仅起了统一组织和有计划地采购的作用，而且也发挥了各厂供销工作人员的积极性。他们不再像过去那样只顾本厂不问他厂需要了，而用密切合作、互相调剂的办法，来解决原材料供应的问题。苏州市轻工业局已经将各厂需要的主要材料列出清单，组织各厂熟悉业务和懂技术的采购人员七十多人外出采购。在采购人员买不到指定的原材料的时候，各工厂就根据量材使用的原则，并在不影响质量的前提下，采购代用品。如苏州市生产小苏打用的纯碱很缺，采购人员就到东北买到了一种天然碱（土碱）代用。当原材料和代用品都缺乏的时候，各工厂就根据设备条件考虑生产新品种，再采购有关原材料。
    组织协作，互通有无，争取来料加工。苏州、无锡两市的工厂，特别是去年新公私合营的工厂，都相继恢复了历史上的协作关系。各厂，甚至和外地的工厂，根据互利和可能的原则，维持和建立加工关系。如苏州、无锡两市的小五金厂缺乏铜，就和上海的五金厂建立加工关系，使生产得以按计划继续进行。在互通有无方面，例如苏州市第一季度需要制造糖精原料“氯磺酸”二十九吨，但这种原材料国内十分缺乏；上海国营某厂每月有五吨“氯磺酸”剩余，却十分需要“派腊”。双方经过交换，彼此都得到满足。各厂还积极争取来料加工，如无锡市动力机厂生产的六十匹马力的煤气机，就是用的湖南省粮食厅自备的原材料。
    有条件地改变产品设计，降低原材料消耗定额，并发动群众收集废料，利用代用品节约原材料。无锡市机械工业系统特别重视推广节约原材料的先进经验。有些工厂研究修改机器结构，在保证机器性能的原则下，减少用料的重量。无锡市水泵厂制造的十二吋水泵，每台重一千零五十公斤，职工们想办法不用底盘，节省进水弯头，每台水泵就可以节约原料二百五十四公斤，原来造三台的材料现在可以制造四台。目前，职工们又在试制沈阳式水泵，试制成功以后，每台可以节约材料七百四十五公斤。以全年生产一百八十五台计算，可以节约一百三十七吨多材料。此外，水泵上的铜弯头，现在也用生铁代替，每台可少用八公斤铜。无锡橡胶厂从去年第四季度到今年1月上旬，就利用各种废胶二百七十多吨，制造了六种橡胶产品。此外，充分发挥私方人员的积极性，也扩大了原材料的采购面。因为有些私方人员业务熟悉，老关系老门路很多，可以设法采购到一些冷门货和奇缺的原材料。
    经过这一系列的努力之后，苏州、无锡两市年初原材料供应紧张的情况已开始缓和。苏州市化工、造纸、小五金等厂第一季度的原料已有90％以上能够得到供应，因而各厂全年的生产计划更加可靠，市轻工业系统今年的生产计划可以比去年的实绩增加20％。无锡市第一工业局所属各厂，也因为克服了原材料供应不足的困难，今年的生产计划也可能超过去年的生产水平。
