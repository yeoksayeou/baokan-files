Soviet Children's Life
    Rural Children's Music School
    In Kopilov Village, 50 kilometers from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, there is a rural children's music school. Children of collective farm members and rural intellectuals can receive systematic music education here. The children's music school has piano, violin, accordion, cello, wind instrument, and three-stringed plucked instrument classes.
    Most of the teachers here come from Kiev. The four music primary schools in Kiev send experienced teachers to teach here and provide strong support in all aspects. The children are very diligent in their studies and have achieved certain results; they can skillfully play different tunes by looking at the sheet music. Their performances at concerts held at the Kiev Conservatory of Music were also very successful.
    Such children's music schools exist all over the Soviet Union.
    Children's Cafeteria
    The first children's cafeteria in Khabarovsk, Russian Federation, Soviet Union, opened on January 31. A group of small customers came here in no hurry, some by themselves and some brought by their mothers. After washing their hands, the children were taken to a spacious and bright hall, which was furnished with many small round tables and chairs. Specially trained waiters carefully took care of the children in turn. Some wanted to be naughty, some put their arms on the table, and some could not use knives and forks flexibly. The waiters patiently taught them how to sit properly and how to use the tableware.
    Although it was the first day, the cafeteria was full. The children did not feel uneasy because of the new environment, on the contrary, they ate very deliciously. The food in the cafeteria is very cheap, but the brilliant and enthusiastic chefs make it very delicious.

    Young Pioneer "Workshop"
    In Soviet schools, special attention is paid to the implementation of comprehensive technical education, so that students can obtain basic knowledge of technology and production, and can either apply for universities after graduation or immediately participate in labor in various sectors of the national economy. For this purpose, all schools have practice workshops, campuses, and organize students to visit factories, farms, and systematically allow students to participate in labor in factories, farms, and school workshops. Moscow No. 346 Middle School has also established a Young Pioneer "Workshop." This workshop has paper handicraft, electrical assembly, ship model, fine woodworking, knitting handicraft, bookbinding, furniture work, art decoration, souvenir, sewing and other workshops. The photo shows the sewing workshop of this Young Pioneer "Workshop," where young workers are carefully sewing clothes. (Zhang) (with picture)

    苏联儿童生活
    乡村儿童音乐学校
    离乌克兰首都基辅五十公里的科丕洛夫村有一所乡村儿童音乐学校，集体农庄庄员和乡村知识分子的孩子们在这里能受到系统的音乐教育，在儿童音乐学校里设有钢琴班、小提琴班、手风琴班、大提琴班、管乐器班和三弦琴班。
    这里的教师多半是从基辅来的。基辅市的四所音乐小学都派出了有经验的教师来到这里教课，并在各方面大力帮助他们。孩子们在学习中都很努力，也取得了一定的成绩；他们看着乐谱就能熟练地奏出不同的曲子来。在基辅音乐馆举办的音乐会中，他们的演出也很成功。
    这样的儿童音乐学校在苏联各地都有。
    儿童食堂
    苏联俄罗斯联邦哈巴罗夫斯克第一所儿童食堂在1月31日开张了。一批小顾客不慌不忙地来到这里，他们有的是自己来的，有的是妈妈带来的。洗完手后，孩子们被带到一间宽敞明亮的大厅里，这里摆有许多小圆桌和小椅子。受过专门训练的侍者依次地仔细照顾孩子们，他们有的想调皮，有的把小胳膊放在桌子上，有的怎么也不会灵活使用刀叉。侍者们耐心地教他们如何坐好，如何使用餐具。
    虽然是第一天，但食堂还是坐得满满的。孩子们并不因为到了新环境而感到不安，相反地却吃得很香。食堂的菜很便宜，但高明而热心的厨师却把它作得很可口。

    少先队员“工场”
    在苏联的学校里特别注意实行综合技术教育，以便使学生得到技术和生产的基本知识，毕业后既能投考高等学校，也能马上参加国民经济各部门的劳动。为了这个目的，各学校都设有实习工场、校园，并组织学生参观工厂、农庄和有系统地让学生参加工厂、农庄和学校工场的劳动。莫斯科第三百四十六中学还建立了少先队员“工场”。这个工场有厚纸细工、电气装配、船舰模型、细木工、编物细工、装订、家具工、美术装璜、纪念品、缝纫等车间。这张照片上就是这个少先队员“工场”的缝纫车间，小工人们正在细心地缝制衣服。（章）（附图片）
