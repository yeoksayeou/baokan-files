Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Soviet Military Attaché to China, Major General Zudov, held a reception this evening to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army.

    In his speech at the reception, Zudov first outlined the glorious 39-year history of the Soviet Armed Forces. He then said that with the continuous care of the Party and the government, the Soviet Armed Forces now possess various types of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, as well as various types of powerful rocket and jet weapons. Our army also has a large number of officers and soldiers who are well-trained in technology and tactics. However, the purpose of the Soviet Union's development and improvement of its armed forces is only to defend the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people and to give a powerful counterattack to any aggressors who dare to invade us. He continued by saying that the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems was, is, and will continue to be the general line of Soviet foreign policy.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, said in his speech at the reception that the glorious history of struggle of the Soviet Army is full of the great patriotism and internationalism of the proletariat. The Soviet Armed Forces victoriously defended the first socialist motherland surrounded by capitalist countries under extremely difficult conditions. It once helped the liberation struggles of the people of Eastern European countries with its unparalleled power, and assisted the liberation cause of the Chinese people and the people of northern Korea. The recent just actions taken by the Soviet Army in the Hungarian incident once again proved the Soviet Army's infinite loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism. The Soviet Army is the backbone of the armed forces of the socialist camp, an important pillar for maintaining world peace, and a reliable friend of the oppressed nations against colonialism.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the development and construction of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in recent years is inseparable from the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union. We will never forget this profound friendship at any time. We will continue to humbly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Army, further strive to develop and consolidate the friendship between the two peoples and their armies, and work together with other peace-loving countries to jointly defend world peace.

    Among those present at the reception tonight were Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council, General Su Yu, Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Chen Geng, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department, as well as senior generals such as Admiral Xiao Jingguang, General Xu Guangda, and representatives of various services and arms.

    Also present at the reception were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei and heads of various central ministries, democratic parties, and social organizations.

    Military attachés of various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the reception.

    At the reception, the guests repeatedly toasted to Sino-Soviet friendship and to the fighting friendship between the armed forces of China and the Soviet Union.
