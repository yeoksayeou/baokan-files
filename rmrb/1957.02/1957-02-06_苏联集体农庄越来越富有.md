　　Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: According to TASS reports, preliminary statistics show that due to the unprecedented bumper harvest of agricultural products last year, the total cash income of Soviet collective farms increased by 20% compared to 1955. Many collective farms have already increased their annual cash income to twenty or thirty million rubles.

　　Last year, the Soviet government once again significantly increased the purchase prices of grains, potatoes, vegetables, cotton, sugar beets, grapes, and livestock products, which also increased the income of collective farms nationwide. Their income from selling products alone was 20 billion rubles more than the previous year.

　　With the rapid increase in income, collective farms throughout the Soviet Union are continuously adopting various measures to improve the lives of their members and provide material security for the sick and elderly. At the "Laborer" Collective Farm in Jiangbul State, Kazakh Republic, all members work more than 300 days a year and have three weeks of vacation. Wages during vacation are paid according to the average daily income for the entire year. Wages during sick leave, pregnancy, and childbirth are also paid in the same way. Male members over 60 and female members over 55 receive lifelong pensions. At the same time, these pensions are paid regardless of whether the member continues to work or retires. Other collective farms have also adopted similar regulations.

    苏联集体农庄越来越富有
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道：据初步统计，去年由于农产品的空前丰收，苏联集体农庄现金的总收入比1955年增加了20％，许多集体农庄全年收入的现金已经增加到两、三千万卢布。
    去年，苏联政府再一次大大提高了谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜、棉花、甜菜、葡萄和畜产品的征购价格，这也为全国集体农庄增加了许多收入。它们单是从交售产品中得到的收入就比前年多二百亿卢布。
    随着收入的迅速增加，苏联各地集体农庄不断采取各种措施，改进庄员生活以及给予病人和老人以物质保证。哈萨克共和国江布尔州“劳动者”集体农庄全体庄员每年工作三百多天，有三周的休假，休假期间的工资按照全年平均每日所得报酬照付，病假、怀孕和分娩期间的工资也是按照这样方法照付。六十岁以上的男庄员和五十五岁以上的女庄员有终年的养老金。同时，这种养老金不问庄员本人是继续工作还是退休一律照付。其他集体农庄也采取了类似的规定。
