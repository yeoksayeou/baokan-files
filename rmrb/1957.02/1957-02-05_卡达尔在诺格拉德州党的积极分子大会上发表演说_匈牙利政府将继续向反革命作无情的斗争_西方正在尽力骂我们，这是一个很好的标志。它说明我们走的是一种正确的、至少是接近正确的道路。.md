Xinhua News Agency, February 4th - According to a TASS report: In a speech delivered on February 2nd in Salgótarján, a major center of the Hungarian coal industry, Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government Premier János Kádár said that the government would wage a relentless struggle against counter-revolution. We should be vigilant at all times and be prepared at all times. Our army should strictly abide by revolutionary discipline and demonstrate firmness and determination in dealing with counter-revolutionaries and those who disrupt order.

Kádár pointed out that some people are now indignant about the arrest of certain writers. Some scoundrels like Háy and Zerk, attempted to use terrorist tactics at a meeting of the Writers' Association against honest writers who said that there had been an attempted counter-revolutionary coup in Hungary, while they themselves asserted that it was a revolution. A similar situation occurred in the Journalists' Association. Kádár said that if we did not stop this action, we, who call ourselves the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, would feel ashamed. Whether he is a writer or someone else, as long as he commits a crime or opposes the interests of the people, he should be punished as he deserves.

At this meeting of activists of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's Nógrád County organization, Kádár once again spoke of the counter-revolutionary nature of the Hungarian events. He pointed out that the counter-revolutionaries deceived many people, but it is clear that their aim was to restore their regime and their power. For example, Cardinal Mindszenty demanded the return of 930,000 holds (one hold equals 0.57 hectares) of church land.

Kádár said that our party had made many mistakes, but every honest person and Communist saw that the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party in July of last year was a turning point in the life of our party. Therefore, after years of planning, when the counter-revolutionary forces saw that the party's correction of its own mistakes was a danger to them, they attacked.

Kádár then emphasized that some people are trying to assert that October 23rd was a day of national revolution. Let us see who was fighting for national independence. In 1919, the Salgótarján Red Guards took up arms to fight for the independence of Hungary, while the Horthyites sold out Hungary's independence and joined the Entente; during the Second World War, they once again sold out national independence, and the Communist Party fought for national independence; with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian people regained national independence. In recent months, it was Hungarian Communists and Soviet soldiers who defended Hungary's independence.

Kádár said that there are still foreign troops stationed here, referring to the Soviet troops. He believes that this cannot be seen as ordinary foreign troops, these are the sons of fraternal socialist countries who sacrificed themselves to defend our country and help us.

Kádár pointed out that at the beginning of the October events, the party leadership included not only sincere people who were loyal to their cause and ideas, but also traitors. This was a tragedy. At that time, people did not receive any firm and clear instructions from the party. Now, Rákosi, Gerő and their ilk, as well as Nagy, Losonczy and many others have been permanently purged from the party.

Kádár said that the West is doing its best to scold us, which is a good sign. It shows that we are on a correct, or at least close to correct, path. If the West starts to praise us, it means that it is time to resign.

When Kádár talked about the tasks of the socialist workers' party organizations at all levels, he said that they should conduct ideological education for the working people, should study the main problems of production, and the workers' committees should contact the working people. There should be Communists in the workers' committees, but they do not necessarily have to be in the majority. (Attached picture)

    卡达尔在诺格拉德州党的积极分子大会上发表演说
    匈牙利政府将继续向反革命作无情的斗争
    西方正在尽力骂我们，这是一个很好的标志。它说明我们走的是一种正确的、至少是接近正确的道路。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔2月2日在匈牙利采煤工业大中心绍耳果托里安市发表的演说中说，政府将向反革命作无情的斗争。我们应当时刻警惕着，应当时刻戒备着。我们的军队应当严格遵守革命纪律，并且在对付反革命分子和破坏秩序的人时要表现出坚定和决心。
    卡达尔指出，现在有的人对逮捕了某些作家表示愤慨。像海伊、泽耳克等这样一些下流东西，企图在作家协会的会议上对那些说在匈牙利曾有人企图进行反革命政变的正直作家采取恐怖手段，而他们自己却断言这是革命。记者协会也有类似情形发生。卡达尔说，如果不制止这种行动，我们称为工农革命政府就会感到惭愧。不管他是作家或是其他人，只要他犯了罪或者反对人民的利益，他就应当受到应得的制裁。
    在这个匈牙利社会主义工人党诺格拉德州组织积极分子大会上，卡达尔再一次谈到匈牙利事件的反革命性质。他指出，反革命分子欺骗了很多人，但是很明显，他们的目的是要恢复他们的政权，恢复他们的势力。例如，红衣主教明曾蒂就要求归还教会九十三万霍尔德（一霍尔德等于零点五七公顷）的土地。
    卡达尔说，我们的党曾经犯过很多错误，但是每一个正直的人和共产党员都看到了，匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会去年7月全会是我们党的生活的转折点。因此，反革命势力经过了多年的策划以后，当他们看到党纠正自己错误对他们是一种危险的时候，他们就加以打击。
    卡达尔接着强调说，有些人企图断言，10月23日是民族革命的日子。我们看是谁在为民族独立而斗争。1919年绍耳果托里安赤卫军拿起武器为匈牙利的独立而斗争，而霍尔蒂分子却出卖匈牙利的独立，参加了协约国；在第二次世界大战期间，他们又一次出卖了民族独立，共产党曾经为民族独立而斗争；在苏联的援助下，匈牙利人民重新获得了民族独立。最近几个月来又是匈牙利共产党员和苏军战士保卫了匈牙利的独立。
    卡达尔说，在这里还驻扎着外国军队，这指的是苏联的部队。他认为这不能看成一般的外国军队，这是兄弟社会主义国家的儿子，他们牺牲自己来保卫我们的国家，来帮助我们。
    卡达尔指出，在十月事件开始的时候，党的领导队伍中不仅有忠于自己的事业和思想的赤诚的人，而且也有变节分子。这是一个悲剧。那时，人们没有得到党的任何坚决而明确的指示。现在，拉科西、格罗及其同流，以及纳吉、洛松齐等许多人已经被永远地清洗出党。
    卡达尔说，西方正在尽力骂我们，这是一个很好的标志。它说明我们走的是一种正确的、至少是接近正确的方向。如果西方开始表扬我们，那就是说，提出辞呈的时候到了。
    卡达尔在谈到社会主义工人党各级组织的任务的时候说，它们应当对劳动人民进行思想教育，应当研究生产的主要问题，而工人委员会应当同劳动人民进行接触。工人委员会中应当有共产党员，但不一定要占多数。（附图片）
