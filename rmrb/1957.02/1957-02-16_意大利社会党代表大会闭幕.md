Xinhua News Agency, February 12th – TASS reports: The 32nd Congress of the Italian Socialist Party, which began on the 6th in Venice, concluded on the 10th.

    A resolution passed at the closing session stated: "The participation of the workers' movement in the leadership of society and the state is the only way to promote the revival of the motherland."

    Regarding the issue of unity within the Italian workers' movement, the resolution pointed out: "The relationship between socialists and communists is naturally based on class solidarity and a shared sense of responsibility towards the working masses, and it is not bound by any treaties or prejudices."

    The resolution called on social democrats to assume the responsibility of implementing socialist policies. The resolution stated that only by implementing such policies is it possible to jointly take the first step on the road to the merger of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party.

    The resolution declared that the Socialist Party intends to strengthen its relations with the workers' movements in the West and the East and believes that, under the condition of "ensuring the preservation of the characteristics of Italian socialism," relations with the Socialist International are a "newly raised" issue.
