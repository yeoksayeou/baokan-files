    世界男子速度滑冰赛结束
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　瑞典奥斯特森德消息：1957年（第五十一届）世界男子速度滑冰冠军赛17日结束。挪威的约翰尼逊获得了世界冠军的称号。获得第二、三、四名的都是苏联运动员。
    17日，比赛一共有一千五百公尺和一万公尺两项。苏联的希尔科夫以二分一三点九秒取得了一千五百公尺的第一名，这时根据已进行的三项比赛的结果，苏联的希尔科夫的成绩（一三七点七四三分）仍遥遥领先，苏联的冈查兰科第二（一三八点九八○分），约翰尼逊在第三（一三九点二五七分）。但是在最后一项一万公尺的比赛中，约翰尼逊以十六分三三点九秒的优异成绩取得第一名，而希尔科夫用十七分一○点三秒的时间才跑完全程，名列第七，因此约翰尼逊的总成绩超过了希尔科夫，他的成绩是一八八点九五二分，希尔科夫成绩是一八九点二八八分取得第二。
    中国运动员没有参加一万公尺的比赛，因而没有总成绩。
