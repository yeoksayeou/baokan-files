Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 1st – The ancient city of Lhasa on the plateau welcomed the dawn of the Spring Festival with a night of joy.

On the evening of the 30th, Tibetan and Han cadres of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region and many other organizations danced happily and gathered closely for the festival under the electric lights.

Workers at various construction sites in Lhasa City also returned to their tent villages from the construction sites on the same evening to hold get-togethers. A group of geological workers on the Tibetan Plateau danced until dawn. They had just returned to Lhasa with data before the Spring Festival. In the past year, they had been to the Himalayan mountain area and camped on the windy and snowy grasslands. They celebrated the year's victory with a night of dancing.

In the transport station of Xinfeng, west of the Potala Palace, just as the employees were dancing gracefully, the car lights illuminated the Linka behind the Potala Palace, and a team of cars loaded with wood drove into the transport station. They had come from the forest hundreds of miles away, crossing the snow-covered Minla Mountain. The employees had not even had time to take off their work clothes before joining the evening party.

When the reporter entered the Tibet Local Cadre School, bursts of singing came from the tent groups. More than 1,000 Tibetan and Han students here were having fun in eight different places. In a large tent, more than 30 Tibetan students were dancing the Lhasa popular circle dance, and in another tent, stories were being told.

At dawn, as the singing and dancing had just ended, Lhasa's stadiums were already waiting for the athletes from the plateau.

    拉萨各族干部和人民
    彻夜欢乐迎接春节
    据新华社拉萨1日电　高原的古城拉萨，用彻夜的欢乐迎接春节的黎明。
    30日夜晚，西藏自治区筹备委员会和许多机关的藏、汉族干部，在电灯光下欢舞和亲密地进行节日的团聚。
    拉萨市各个工地上的工人们，也都在当天傍晚从工地回到帐篷村里举行联欢活动。在西藏高原上的一批地质工作人员，一直欢舞到天明。他们春节前才带着资料回到拉萨。过去的一年中，他们到过喜马拉雅山山区，在大风雪的草原上露宿过。他们用彻夜的欢舞庆祝一年来的胜利。
    在布达拉宫西边新峰的运输站里，正当职工们翩翩起舞时，车灯照亮了布达拉宫后面的林卡，一队满载木材的汽车开进了运输站。他们是从几百里外的森林里，翻过积雪的敏拉山赶来。职工们还没有顾得脱下工作服，就参加了晚会。
    当记者走进西藏地方干部学校的时候，帐篷群里传出了阵阵歌声，这里的一千多名藏、汉族学员正分八处联欢。在一个大帐篷里，三十多个藏族学员正在跳着拉萨流行的环舞，另一个帐篷里正在讲故事。
    黎明，歌舞刚罢，拉萨的球场已在等待着高原的运动员们。
