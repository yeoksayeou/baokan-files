The Modekou Hydropower Station in the Shijingshan District of western Beijing is about to generate electricity. This hydropower station is built on the Yongding River diversion canal and utilizes the drop in the Yongding River diversion canal to generate electricity. The project is small in scale and low in cost. All investment can be recovered in less than two years after it is put into operation.

The Modekou Hydropower Station started construction in mid-January 1956 and was basically completed in October of the same year. After the Yongding River diversion project releases water, it will be put into operation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid to supply electricity for the capital's industry and people's lives. Because this power station adopts automatic and remote mechanical devices, the entire operation will be remotely controlled by the Shijingshan Power Plant, and there will be no regular duty personnel in the plant building.

    即将发电的石景山模式口水电站
    首都西郊石景山区的模式口水电站即将发电。这座水电站修建在永定河引水渠道上，是利用永定河引水渠道上的落差来发电的。它的工程量很小，造价很低，投入运转后，不到两年就可收回全部投资。
    模式口水电站在1956年1月中旬开工，同年10月份基本完工，待永定河引水工程放水后，即投入京、津、唐电力网运转，供给首都工业和人民生活用电。这个电站由于采用了自动装置和遥远机械装置，整个运行情况，将由石景山发电厂进行远方控制，厂房里不设经常值班员。　（附图片）
