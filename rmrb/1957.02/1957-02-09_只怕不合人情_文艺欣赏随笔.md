Only Fearing It Doesn't Suit Human Sentiment
—Literary Appreciation Essays	Wang Chaowen

	In the past, there was an unusual way of eating in Luzhou, Sichuan: eating rice-pop candy and other sweet desserts accompanied by spicy and salty dried radish. Mixing sweet with spicy and salty things, those who are not used to it inevitably find it a mess. However, once you taste the benefits of this way of eating, you'll miss it if you don't eat it this way next time. The attitude towards this way of eating is like the attitude towards Cantonese people eating undercooked fish: it is best not to negate it arbitrarily based on your own habits. At the very least, one must admit that this is also a way of eating.

	A leading comrade in an art school believed that "figures should not appear with their backs to the audience in paintings," which caused dissatisfaction among those being led. In most cases, the figures in paintings always face the audience. But to think that this is the only permissible way is indeed somewhat arbitrary, just like completely denying the eating habits of Cantonese and Luzhou people. We are already very familiar with the back view of the agitated old woman in German painter Käthe Kollwitz's "Peasant War," which is almost as if even the folds of her clothes are agitated.

	The saying that one should not face away from the audience first appeared in books on the basics of theatrical performance. However, even in theater and film itself, the phenomenon of facing away from the audience is common. And some are very expressive. In the ballet "Notre Dame de Paris," performed in China by Soviet dramatists in 1954, the kind, trampled-upon girl who was eventually wrongly killed in the name of the law, barefoot, dragging her thin white dress, with her long hair disheveled, walking blankly towards the guillotine; in the Japanese film "It is Only for Love," shown in our country last year, the mother who walked numbly out of the cold prison gate where her son was detained, sat on the sidewalk as if paralyzed, and when she stood up, her back looked old, sad, and bewildered... all these backs were very moving. Sichuan opera actress Liao Jingqiu, at a performance forum in August 1954, introduced her experience of consciously turning her back to the audience when playing Du Shiniang in "Li Jia Returns to Gui Prefecture." In order to express Du Shiniang's despair, sorrow, resentment, and the complex mood of blaming herself for misjudging people, "...turning my back to Li Jia and also to the audience, sitting on the chair in a dizzy and weak manner, using the twitching of my back to express Du Shiniang's secret crying, I think this is more powerful and more moving than crying in front of Li Jia and the audience."

	Rules that bind creativity cannot bind artists who dare to create, and unconventional forms of expression also have reliable foundations. Not only is the issue of facing away from the audience like this, but other creative issues are also like this.

	Unquestionably, the tune of the Peking opera "Little Cowherd" cannot be interchanged with the tune of "The Empty City Stratagem," because they serve different moods, different life contents, and different themes. But we cannot simply understand the relationship between content and form and make rigid regulations. Just like not allowing facing away from the audience at all, thinking that sorrowful scenes must use purple and green lights, the stage must be dark, and joyful scenes must use red lights, the stage must be bright, and if the plot takes place at night, the stage must be made completely dark, these too "realistic" methods are actually somewhat mechanical.

	One characteristic of the Sichuan opera "The Story of the Willow Shade" can also be mentioned. The section of the play before Zhu Yingtai is forced onto the sedan chair uses lively wind music for weddings. When listened to in isolation, it is pleasant, and "out of tune" with the performance on stage; the hot color dilutes or destroys the cold tone. On the contrary, just as using a little spicy and salty food between sweet foods makes the former's special taste stand out, Zhu Yingtai, who is in extreme grief, is even more able to prompt the audience to further feel the pain of her situation, understand the complexity of her mood at this moment, and better communicate with her emotions, and tears are brought down by the joyful suona sounds.

	Some people think that the gongs and drums of Sichuan opera are too stimulating, but people who are used to listening to these gongs and drums do not think so. On the contrary, they feel that if it is reduced, it will affect the emotional exchange between the audience and the characters. For example, before Du Shiniang throws herself into the river, accompanied by the lyrics "There is no place for me to settle in this world, Heaven, I will hatefully die with my eyes unclosed," is the very loud and extremely passionate music—"tanggu" inserted after "Heaven." If one thinks that it is not as harmonious as the accompaniment used in some Western singing, and thinks that it "overshadows the main theme" and deletes it, or lowers it, Du Shiniang's sorrowful and indignant mood will instead lose its strong color. The "tanggu" sandwiched between the singing is not so much a supplement, foil, or aid to the character's psychology and emotions, but rather an expression of the "deformed" and "enlarged" image of the character's psychology and emotions. Because this musical arrangement is based on the basic characteristics of the character's psychology and emotions, even if it adopts an unrealistic way of expression, the audience can understand it and believe it. It can even be said that the character's psychology and emotions are therefore more distinct and easier to approach. What is important is that it is not only an image-based expression of the character's psychology and emotions, but also an image-based expression of the audience's emotional reaction. This reaction comes from art, but it turns around to further stimulate the audience's in-depth understanding of the character's situation.

	If these examples are still considered remote, one might as well look at works that many people have approached. Lu Xun's novel "Blessing" has a cold enough tone. However, from beginning to end, as "accompaniment," there is the crackling sound of firecrackers, which is very lively. This lively sound is obviously incompatible with Xianglin's wife's mood and Xianglin's wife's death. However, this not only does not destroy the integrity of Xianglin's wife's image, but on the contrary makes the "person who no one pities" more incompatible with the environment, and highlights the characteristics of the character and fate. The lively sound of firecrackers is cold in the reader's feeling, and it intensifies the heaviness of the reader's mood. Lu Xun used the lively sound of firecrackers that is compatible with general blessings but incompatible with the character and fate of the unfortunate, perhaps to make Xianglin's wife's experience of being trampled on and harmed more unreasonable, and to evoke more sympathy!

	The life reflected in art should be extremely complex, and the aesthetic requirements of the appreciator are not very simple either. The art forms that provide people with appreciation and reflect life should also be diverse. Original and unique forms of expression are valuable, and simplistic views and practices can only hinder the normal development of art. "Legends do not need to be cool or hot, only fear that they do not suit human sentiment" (Liweng's Drama Theory). The diversification and novelty of artistic expression are not inherently in conflict with the richness of the life reflected in art.

    只怕不合人情
    ——文艺欣赏随笔	王朝闻
    从前，四川泸州有一种不平常的吃法：吃米花糖这些甜点心，用辣而咸的萝卜干来伴食。甜的和辣而咸的东西搅在一起，不习惯的人难免觉得这是乱搞的。可是，尝到这种吃法的好处，下次不这样吃，还要想它呢。对待这种吃法，好比对待广东人吃不熟的鱼肉那样，最好不要凭自己的习惯妄加否定。至少，得承认这也是一种吃法。
    有一个美术学校的领导同志认为“画面上不应当出现背向观众的人物”，引起被领导者的不满。多数的情况，画面上的人物总是面向观众的。但要是以为只许如此，就和根本否定广东和泸州的吃法那样，确实有些武断。我们已经很熟悉了的德国画家珂勒惠支的“农民战争”中那个激动的老妇人的背面，几乎可以说连衣纹都是激动着的。
    不许背向观众的说法，首先见于戏剧表演常识一类的书上。可是，就连戏剧电影本身，背向观众的现象也是常有的。而且有些是很有表现力的。1954年苏联戏剧家们在中国演出的舞剧“巴黎圣母院”，那个善良、被人践踏最后还在法律的名义下冤死的少女，赤脚、拖着薄薄的白衣服，披着长发，失神地走向断头台时的背影；去年在我国演出的日本影片“正是为了爱”，那个木然地走出拘留爱子的牢狱的冷冰冰的大门，像要瘫痪了似地坐在街沿上的母亲站起来时她那显得衰老、伤心，惶惑……的背影，都是很动人的。川剧演员廖静秋，1954年8月在一个表演座谈会上，介绍了她在“李甲归州”里扮演杜十娘时有意识地背向观众的经验。为了表现杜十娘的绝望、悲哀、怨恨和埋怨自己错认了人时的复杂心情，“……背向着李甲也背向着观众，昏眩无力地坐在椅上，用背的抽动来表现杜十娘暗中的哭泣，我认为这样比面对李甲和观众哭泣，更为有力，更为动人。”
    束缚创造力的规矩不能束缚敢于创造的艺术家，破格的表现方式也有可靠的根据。不只背向观众的问题是这样，其他创作问题也是这样。
    不成问题，京剧“小放牛”的曲调不能和“空城计”的曲调相调换，因为它们服从的是不同的情调，不同的生活内容，不同的主题。但不能因此简单了解内容与形式的关系，作出硬性的规定。如同根本不容许背向观众一样，以为悲哀场面就得用紫色、绿色的灯光，台上要暗，愉快的用红色，台上要亮，情节发生在夜晚就弄得台上黑呼呼一片，这些太“现实”的办法，其实未免机械。
    川剧“柳荫记”的一个特点，还可以提一提。祝英台被迫上轿之前的那一段戏，用了婚事用的曲调活泼的管乐。孤立地听起来，这是愉快的，和台上的表演“不调和的”；热颜色把冷调子冲淡了或破坏了。恰恰相反，在吃甜的食物之间用点辣而咸的食物因而更显出前者的特殊味道似的，悲恸欲绝的祝英台得到愉快的音乐的映衬，反而更能促使观众进一步感到她的处境的痛苦，体会到她此刻心情的复杂，更能与她的感情交流，眼泪被愉快的唢呐声催下来。
    有人以为川剧的锣鼓敲打得太刺激了，可是，听惯了这种锣鼓的人，不这样觉得。相反，觉得如果减掉它，就会影响欣赏者与角色的情感的交流。例如杜十娘投江之前，和唱词“世间无我安身处，天哪，含恨终身不瞑目”相伴的，是插在“天哪”之后的很响的非常激昂的音乐——“堂鼓”，要是以为它不如某些西洋歌唱所用的伴奏调和，以为它“喧宾夺主”，删去它，或降低它，杜十娘的悲愤心情就反而丧失了强烈的色彩。夹在唱之间的“堂鼓”，与其说是角色心理和情绪的补充、衬托或辅助，不如说是角色的心理和情绪的“变形”和“扩大”了的形象的表现。因为这种音乐的配置是基于角色的心理和情绪的基本特征的，即令采用了不逼真的方式来表现，观众也能够了解它，相信它。甚至可以说角色的心理和情绪因而更鲜明，更便于接近。重要的是：它不只是角色心理和情绪的形象化的表现，也可以说是观众情绪反应的形象化的表现。这种反应来自艺术，它却反转来进一步激发观众对于角色的处境的深入体会。
    如果还嫌这些例子偏僻，不妨看看很多人接近过的作品。鲁迅的小说“祝福”，情调是够冷的了。可是，从头至尾，作为“伴奏”的，是毕毕剥剥的爆竹声，热闹得很。这热闹的声音，和祥林嫂的心情，和祥林嫂的死，显然是不相适应的。可是，这样不仅没有破坏祥林嫂形象的完整性，反而更显得“谁也不可怜的人”和环境的不相适应，更显出人物性格和命运的特色。热闹的爆竹声，在读者感受上是冷酷的，它加重了读者心情的沉重。鲁迅利用了和一般的祝福相适应而和不幸者的性格和命运不相适应的热闹的爆竹声，也许是为了更加显得被作践、被损害了的祥林嫂的遭遇的不合理，更引人同情的吧！
    艺术所反映的生活应该是异常复杂的，欣赏者的审美要求也不是很简单的。供人欣赏和反映生活的艺术形式，也应该是多种多样的。别出心裁的表现形式才可贵，简单化的看法和做法只能妨碍艺术的正常发展。“传奇无冷热，只怕不合人情”（笠翁剧论）。艺术表现形式的多样化和新颖，本来和艺术所反映的生活的丰富性不是冲突的。
