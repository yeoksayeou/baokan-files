Transforming Half-Finished Wells
	Zhao Qi
In the winter of the year before last and the spring of last year, many regions dug a large number of wells during large-scale farmland water conservancy construction. In Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces alone, more than 3 million wells were dug during this period. Due to insufficient preparation, lack of underground water source data, and inadequate technical guidance, a certain number of these wells are half-finished wells with insufficient water volume. According to a survey in Henan Province, nearly half of the 1.04 million newly dug wells are shallow and have insufficient water volume. Transforming these half-finished wells is an important task in this year's farmland water conservancy construction.

Existing experience has proven that transforming half-finished wells requires less effort and yields good results. According to experiments in Neihuang County, Henan Province, it only costs more than 30 yuan and about 80 workdays to transform a half-finished well using the brick lining method. After the half-finished well is transformed, the water volume generally increases by three or four times compared to before, and in some cases even eight or nine times. In Bianzhuang Village, Neihuang County, the original water depth of a half-finished well was 2.3 meters; after installing a brick lining, the water depth increased to 8.5 meters; using a power waterwheel to draw water, it can yield more than 30 tons of water per hour. After the transformation, a half-finished well with little water became a deep well that can irrigate 220 mu of land. Small investment and large returns are the principles we should follow in farmland water conservancy construction. Before the spring plowing this year, agricultural cooperatives in many well-irrigated areas are busy with agricultural and sideline production, and some cooperatives do not have much production capital. Transforming half-finished wells is more suitable for their needs.

Like digging wells, the level of technology determines the quality of the transformation of half-finished wells. How to solve the technical problems of transforming half-finished wells? The experience of Neihuang County is: look among the masses. Because Neihuang County has well summarized the well-digging experience of the masses, it has successively found three or four ways to transform half-finished wells. Digging wells and finding springs has long been a custom in northern provinces. As long as we follow the mass line, there will definitely be more experience suitable for local conditions.

Using well water for irrigation is one of the important ways to overcome drought in agricultural production. In many areas of Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces, the area irrigated by wells accounts for more than half of the total irrigated area. In recent years, Northwest, Northeast, and some areas of the South have also been actively using groundwater resources through wells. By overcoming drought, the unit yield of crops can be guaranteed or increased. In ordinary years, the yield of well-irrigated land in some arid areas of the North is generally one or two times higher than that of dry land. If drought occurs, its benefits are even more significant. All cadres must recognize the importance of using well water for irrigation in order to rapidly develop the work of transforming half-finished wells.

Under normal circumstances, transforming a half-finished well can expand the irrigation area by 10 to 20 mu. If we can transform one million half-finished wells this year, we can expand the irrigation area by 10 to 20 million mu. This year, the task of expanding the irrigated area nationwide is still very large, and transforming half-finished wells is an important method for expanding the irrigated area.

Although the well-digging work from the winter before last to the spring of last year had many shortcomings, the achievements are still the main aspect. The area of well irrigation expanded during this period is almost equal to the area of well irrigation in China since recorded history before this period. Without a large-scale well-digging movement, how could the well irrigation business have developed so rapidly! In order to consolidate and expand the achievements in this work, and in order to overcome the shortcomings in this work, the work of transforming half-finished wells should also be done well.

    改造半成井	赵起
    前年冬天和去年春天，许多地区在大规模兴修农田水利当中打了很多井。只河南、山东、山西三个省在这个时期打的井就有三百多万眼。由于准备工作不够、缺乏地下水源资料和技术指导跟不上，这些已打的井有一定数量是水量不足的半成井。据河南省调查，新打的一百零四万眼井有近半数是浅的和水量不足的半成井。把半成井改造好，是今年兴修农田水利当中的一个重要任务。
    已有的经验证明，改造半成井费力较小，收效很好。据河南内黄县试验，用下砖套筒办法改造一眼半成井只要三十多元，和大约八十个工。半成井改造好以后，水量一般比以前增加三、四倍，有的甚至八、九倍。内黄县卞庄村一个半成井，原来水深二公尺三；经过下砖套筒，水深增加为八公尺五；用动力水车提水，每小时能出水三十多吨。经过改造，一个出水不多的半成井，变成了可以浇地二百二十亩的深井了。投资小、收效大，是我们兴修农田水利应该遵守的原则。今年春耕以前，许多井灌区的农业合作社农副业繁忙，有些社生产资金又不多。改造半成井就更适合它们的要求了。
    改造半成井和打井一样，技术的高低决定质量的好坏。改造半成井的技术问题怎样解决呢？内黄县的经验是：在群众中找。内黄县由于很好地总结了群众打井经验，先后找出三、四种改造半成井的办法。打井下泉在北方各省早有习惯，只要走群众路线，一定会有更多的适合当地情况的经验出现。
    利用井水灌溉是农业生产上战胜干旱的重要办法之一。河北、山东等省的许多地区都有井灌面积占到总灌溉面积一半以上的情况。西北、东北和南方若干地区近年来也都在积极地通过水井利用地下水源。战胜干旱，农作物的单位产量就能得到保证或提高。北方一些干旱地区的井灌地的产量，在平常年景一般比旱地高一、二倍，如遇旱灾，它的效益就更显著了。必须使所有干部认识用井水灌溉的重要意义，才能使改造半成井的工作迅速开展。
    按一般情况，改造一眼半成井可以扩大灌溉面积十亩到二十亩。如果能在今年改造好一百万眼半成井，我们就可以扩大灌溉面积一、二千万亩。今年全国扩大灌溉面积的任务还是很大的，改造半成井正是扩大灌溉面积的一个重要方法。
    前冬去春的打井工作虽然有不少缺点，但是成绩毕竟是主要的。这个时期扩大的井灌面积，几乎等于这个时期以前我国有史以来的井灌面积。如果没有大规模的打井运动，井灌事业哪能这样突飞猛进地发展！为了巩固和扩大在这件工作上的成就，为了克服以前在这件工作上的缺点，也应该把改造半成井的工作做好。
