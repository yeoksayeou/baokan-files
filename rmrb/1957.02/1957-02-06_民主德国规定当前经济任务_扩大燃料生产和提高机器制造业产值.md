Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 5th - According to the German News Agency, maximizing the expansion of fuel production (including lignite, hard coal, and liquid fuels) is the decisive economic task of the German Democratic Republic in 1957. The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party emphasized this point in its resolution on the recent economic tasks adopted at its thirtieth plenary session. It also pointed out that another major task in industrial production is to increase the output value of machine manufacturing without increasing raw materials, in order to better meet domestic and export needs. The resolution called on relevant state agencies to eliminate all obstacles that hinder the economic initiative of handicrafts and private enterprises.

The most decisive task for state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, farmer mutual aid associations, and individual farmers this year is to not leave any arable land uncultivated during the spring ploughing. The resolution demands more care than before be given to individual small farmers (who own about 70% of all cultivated land in the German Democratic Republic).

This year, priority in housing construction will be given to construction projects that can be put into production most quickly to supply civilian and export needs, and to people's housing. The resolution believes that the current number of giant buildings, entertainment venues, and stadiums is sufficient, and future construction should strive for good quality, low cost, fast construction, and practicality.

    民主德国规定当前经济任务
    扩大燃料生产和提高机器制造业产值
    新华社柏林5日电　据德意志通讯社报道：最大限度地扩大燃料（包括褐煤、硬煤和液体燃料）的生产是德意志民主共和国1957年具有决定意义的经济任务。德国统一社会党中央委员会在它的第三十次全体会议上通过的关于最近时期经济任务的决议中着重指出了这一点。它还指出，工业生产方面的另一项主要任务是：在不增加原料的条件下，提高机器制造业的产值，以便更好地满足本国和出口的需要。决议号召各有关国家机关消除妨碍手工业和私营企业在经济上发挥积极性的一切障碍。
    国营农场、农业生产合作社、农民互助协会和个体农民今年最具有决定意义的任务是在春耕中不荒废任何可耕地。决议要求对个体小农（他们拥有的耕地面积占民主德国全部耕地70％左右）给予较前更多的关心。
    今年的房屋建筑优先权属于那些能最迅速投入生产以供应民用和出口需要的建设工程和人民住宅。决议认为：现在的巨型大厦、文娱场所和体育场在数量上已经足够，今后的建筑应力求做到质量好、费用少、建筑快和实用。
