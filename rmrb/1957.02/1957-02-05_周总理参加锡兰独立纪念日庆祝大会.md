Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, February 4th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long attended the Ceylon Independence Day celebration at Independence Square at 8:00 am today.

The Chinese Premier and Vice Premier were invited to sit with the Governor-General of Ceylon, the Prime Minister, and the Chief Justice of the Ceylon Supreme Court. After the band played the Ceylon national anthem, the leaders of Ceylon reviewed the neat ranks of female and male students from various schools.

This was followed by gymnastic and sports performances by male and female students, including somersaults, parallel bars, and some of Ceylon's national sports such as whip cracking. During the music and folk dance performances, the Chinese guests were deeply attracted by the Lezim dance performed by one hundred female teachers wearing saris of various colors. Holding clanging iron rings with wooden handles, they danced rhythmically to the beat of the drums. The review and performances ended at about 10:00 am.

    接着是男女学生们的体操和体育表演，包括翻跟斗、双杠和一些锡兰的民族体育项目如击鞭等。在音乐和民间舞蹈表演中，中国客人为穿着各种颜色的沙丽的一百名女教师所表演的勒齐姆舞深深地吸引住了。她们拿着有木柄的叮铃作响的铁环，随着鼓声有节奏地跳着舞。检阅和表演在上午十时左右结束。
