    Taihu Lake covers an area of approximately 36,000 hectares, spanning Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The lake contains more than ten small islands, with beautiful mountains, clear water, and pleasant scenery. The lake produces many fish. The land around the lake is fertile, and agricultural products are also very abundant. The rice here is large and fragrant, a local specialty of the Jiangnan region. The picture shows the scenery of Taihu Lake after the snow, with the Taihu Workers' Sanatorium on the right.

    太湖面积约有三万六千顷，横跨江苏、浙江两省之间。湖中有小岛十多处，山秀水清，风景宜人。湖中产鱼很多。濒湖一带土地肥沃，农作物出产也极丰富。这里的稻谷，粒大味香，是江南地方的特产。图为雪后太湖的景致，右面是太湖工人疗养院。
