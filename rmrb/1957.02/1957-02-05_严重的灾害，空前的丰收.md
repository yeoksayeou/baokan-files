Severe Disaster, Unprecedented Harvest
Dong Youqin

Fuyang County in Zhejiang is a semi-mountainous area, with most of its 300,000 mu of farmland concentrated on both banks of the Fuchun River. In May of last year, a mountain torrent burst, and the Fuchun River flooded more than 100,000 mu of farmland. In July, 93,000 mu of rice paddies suffered from drought; in the five townships of Chunjiang, Sanlian, etc., along the Fuchun River, 80% of the farmland was affected by drought. In August, it was hit by a typhoon of level 10 or higher, and a night of wind and rain brought mountain torrents and river flooding. All twenty-six townships in the county suffered severe losses. In addition to collapsing houses and injuries, 38,000 mu of early and mid-season rice and mid-season corn were damaged by wind and water, resulting in a 30% reduction in yield; 28,000 mu of the 100,000 mu of late rice needed to be replanted or supplemented; and more than 10,200 mu of farmland turned into sandy beaches. 98,900 dan of green bamboo raw materials for papermaking in the mountainous areas were washed away by mountain torrents, and 72,000 dan of raw materials for pit-edge paper in the plains were also lost.

It seemed that the flood washed away the good days of the people of Fuyang County.

The disaster did not frighten the 55,000 cooperative member households in the county; they relied on the cooperatives to overcome the disaster. The county's agricultural and sideline production achieved an all-round bumper harvest: total grain output reached 1,574,430 dan, an increase of more than 21% compared to the previous year; the output value of the paper industry was 10.08 million yuan, an increase of 19% compared to the previous year. The annual distribution results of the county's 410 cooperatives showed that 83.6% of the cooperatives increased the income of 90% of their members, and 12.6% of the cooperatives increased the income of more than 80% of their members. While mentioning the disasters brought to the people by the Fuchun River, the cooperative members, facing the Fuchun River that had been defeated for the first time, spoke the heroic words of the victors: "We always thought that a night of flood would lead to the King of Hell; but it turned out to be a dream of calm winds and waves!"

The all-round bumper harvest of agricultural and sideline production brought a new look to the rural areas of the county. The county overfulfilled its grain purchase task by 27%. The purchasing power of farmers exceeded that of 1955 by 50%. Every household ate well and dressed warmly, and no longer lived the life of begging, fleeing famine, and eating bran and vegetables for half a year, as they did in the past during disaster years.

Why was Fuyang County able to achieve a bumper harvest amidst deep and frequent disasters?

Last spring, a high tide of cooperation was set off in the rural areas of Fuyang County, and all 55,000 farmer households in the county participated in the cooperatives.

The cooperatives greatly changed the farming system, planting 137,000 mu of double-season rice (six times more than the previous year), changing the planting habits of only a small amount of double-season rice for thousands of years; before the typhoon and flood in August, the county had already harvested more than 40 million jin of early rice, and each of the 410 agricultural cooperatives had increased its income compared to the same period of the previous year. This provided a reliable material basis for stabilizing the people's morale after the disaster and actively carrying out rescue work; coupled with the bumper harvest of late rice, Fuyang County changed its situation of grain shortage. Without cooperation, it would be impossible to change the farming system in large patches and fields; without large-scale changes in the farming system, it would be difficult to achieve increased production. If you don't believe it, please take a look at the situation in Huangtianfan! Huangtianfan has more than 30,000 mu of land, which was a place of "nine years of no harvest out of ten" before liberation. After liberation, the state built the Dapu Sluice, and the average yield per mu was only 300 jin; last year, the cooperative changed single-season rice to double-season rice, and winter fallow fields to spring flower fields, and harvested more than 15 million jin of rice alone, an increase of 32.4% compared to the previous year. Huangtianfan has become a "Golden Fan"!

Last May, the Fuchun River mountain torrents flooded more than 100,000 mu of farmland. The cooperatives exerted collective strength and recovered the ripe spring flower crops from the floods, resulting in a 24.7% increase in wheat production compared to the previous year. In July, the drought lasted for fifty days, and the cooperatives organized the masses to overcome the drought. During the drought resistance period, Xinmin Cooperative installed eighteen waterwheels and organized forty or fifty people to draw water and dig canals together, drawing the distant river water to the fields level by level. On August 1, during the typhoon and flood, the cooperatives organized forces in advance to take precautions, mobilized more than 11,000 farmer households to escape danger in the midst of wind and rain, and rushed to harvest 7,454 mu of early rice, rescuing large quantities of grain and farm tools.

After the typhoon and flood, the cooperatives seized the season and first rushed to plant indica rice within five days after autumn, followed by autumn corn; after that, they planted buckwheat and vegetables. This allowed them to strive for more grain and ensure that the fields were not left uncultivated.

By August 10, the county had completed the early rice harvesting work in less than ten days; replanted and supplemented 28,000 mu of late rice and 13,600 mu of autumn corn; removed more than 4,000 mu of yellow sand from the fields and planted late crops; repaired 1,953 water conservancy projects; and also universally carried out weeding and fertilization on the fields planted with late rice and miscellaneous grains; they also used medicine and machinery to manually eliminate pests on 2,400 mu of late rice; 80% of the paper mills in the mountainous areas had resumed production, and a large number of green bamboo that had been blown down by the typhoon were cut down to increase the raw materials for handmade paper. Due to seizing the season to rescue and replant, the county reduced losses by 1.2 million yuan in grain and sideline production alone; each of the 55,000 farm households earned an average of 22 yuan more.

Let's compare some of the situations after disasters in the past and now! Before liberation, Fuyang County also often suffered from floods. At that time, the farmers were half-starved and went to pick up sand. They could open up the fields but could not save their lives. Therefore, they fled famine, lost their lives, sold their sons and daughters, and their wives and children were scattered, and the fields were abandoned. The farmland in Datian Village that was buried by yellow sand in the 30th year of Daoguang was not completely removed until the beginning of liberation; last year, this village organized a youth commando team of 196 people, who "searched for materials during the day and picked up sand at night," and in less than half a month, they dug back 3,000 sections of yellow paper raw materials from the pools and deep sand, and recovered 52 mu of sand-covered fields, resuming production. Last year's disaster was several times more severe than that time, but there were no abandoned fields or land, and no one starved to death. The farmers said: "Without the Communist Party and without organizing cooperatives, if we encountered a disaster like last year, there would be no way to beg for food, and we would not be able to recover for five or ten years!"

Last year, in overcoming natural disasters, the cooperatives throughout the county formed an organized and led labor army. For example, Wuzhou Township mobilized more than 1,200 people to support Changan Township in picking up sand and opening up fields to restore production; Jiangfeng, Sanlian, Yushan, and other townships dispatched more than 300 people with a single order, rushing to Daqing, Sanqiao, and other places overnight to harvest early rice; many cooperatives in lightly affected areas also sent people and cattle to help cooperatives in severely affected areas restore production. The farmers in the disaster areas generally reflected: "Cooperatives all over the world are one family, and we are not afraid of wind and rain disasters."

This is how Fuyang County achieved a bumper harvest in the midst of severe disasters.

    严重的灾害，空前的丰收	董佑勤
    浙江富阳县是个半山区，三十万亩田地大部分集中在富春江两岸。去年5月，山洪暴发，富春江水淹没了十万多亩田地。7月，九万三千亩水稻受旱；地处富春江沿岸的春江、三联等五个乡，有80％的田地受旱。8月又遭到十级以上的台风袭击，一夜狂风暴雨，带来了山洪暴发、江水泛滥，全县二十六个乡，乡乡都遭到严重损失。除了坍房伤人以外，有三万八千亩早中稻、中玉米受到风伤水淹，减产三成；十万亩晚稻有二万八千亩需要改种或者补种；有一万零二百多亩田地变成了沙滩。山区造纸的青竹原料被山洪冲去了九万八千九百来担，平原的坑边纸的原料也损失了七万二千多担。
    看来，当时这场洪水，似乎冲掉了富阳县人民的好日子。
    灾害没有吓倒全县五万五千户加入了合作社的农民；他们依靠合作社战胜了灾害。全县农副业生产全面丰收：粮食总产量达到一百五十七万四千四百三十担，比前年增加了21％多；纸业产值一千零八十万元，比前年增加了19％。全县四百一十个合作社全年分配结果，有83.6％的社做到90％的社员增加收入，有12.6％的社做到80％以上的社员增加收入。合作社的社员们，在提起了富春江给人民带来灾难的同时，对着头一回吃了败仗的富春江，说出了胜利者的豪语：“总以为，一夜洪水见阎王；却原来，风平浪静梦一场！”
    农副业生产的全面丰收，给全县农村带来了新的景象。全县粮食征购任务超额完成了27％。农民的购买力超过了1955年的50％，家家户户吃得饱、穿得暖，不再像过去灾年一样，过着讨饭、逃荒、糠菜半年粮的生活了。
    为什么富阳县在深重而又频繁的灾害中能够获得丰收？
    去年春天，富阳县农村掀起了合作化的高潮，全县五万五千户农民全部参加了合作社。
    合作社大面积地改变了耕作制度，种植了十三万七千亩双季稻（比上一年多六倍），改变了千百年来只有小量双季稻的种植习惯；在8月份台风和洪水袭来以前，全县已经收到四千多万斤早稻，四百一十个农业社，社社都比前年同期增加了收入。这就使灾后稳定群众情绪，积极地进行抢救工作有了可靠的物质基础；加上晚稻的丰收，使得富阳县改变了一向缺粮的情况。要不是合作化，想成片成畈地改变耕作制度是不可能的；没有大面积的改变耕作制度，想获得增产是困难的。不信，请看一看皇天畈的情况吧！皇天畈有三万多亩田，解放前是个“十年九不收”的地方，解放后，国家造了大浦闸，每亩平均只产三百斤；去年合作社把单季稻改为双季稻，冬闲田改为春花田，光水稻就收了一千五百多万斤，比前年增产32.4％。皇天畈变成了“黄金畈”！
    去年5月，富春江山洪暴发，淹没了十多万亩田地，合作社发挥了集体力量，在洪水中夺回结了实的春花作物，使得小麦的产量比前年增加了24.7％。7月，旱象持续了五十天之久，合作社组织了群众战胜了旱灾。新民社在抗旱期间，装上了十八道水车，组织了四五十人一起车水、开渠，把远处的江水一级一级地引到田里。8月1日那一次的台风和洪水，合作社事先组织了力量作了防范，在狂风暴雨中动员了一万一千多户农民脱离险境，抢收了七千四百五十四亩早稻，抢出了大批粮食和农具。
    在台风洪水过后，合作社紧紧地抓住季节，在秋后五天内，首先抢种籼稻，其次抢种秋玉米；在此以后，又种了荞麦和蔬菜。这样就争取了多打粮食，保证不荒芜田地。
    全县到8月10日，不出十天就结束了早稻的抢收工作；改种和补种了二万八千亩晚稻、一万三千六百亩秋玉米；挑去田地上的黄沙四千多亩，并且种上了晚作；修复了一千九百五十三处水利工程；在种有晚稻、杂粮的田地上，也普遍地进行了削草施肥工作；还用药械，人工治除了二千四百亩晚稻的虫害；山区纸业已经有80％的厂槽恢复了生产，另外还削办了大批被台风吹倒的青竹，增加了土纸原料。由于抓紧季节抢救抢种，全县光粮食和副业生产两项就减少了一百二十万元的损失；五万五千户农户，每户平均多收二十二元。
    比一比过去和现在灾后的一些情况吧！解放前富阳县也时常遭到洪水灾害，那时候农民半饥半饿地去挑沙，开得起田也救不起命，因此逃荒的逃荒，亡命的亡命，卖男鬻女，妻离子散，田地荒芜。大田村在道光三十年被黄沙掩没了的田地，一直到解放初才挑完黄沙；去年这个村组织了青年突击队，一百九十六个人，“日找料，夜挑沙”，不到半个月的功夫，从潭里、深沙中挖回三千段黄纸原料，挑出了五十二亩沙盖田，恢复了生产。去年灾害比起那时要深重几倍，却没有荒田、荒地，更没有人饿死。农民说：“没有共产党，不组织合作社，遇到去年那样的灾害，讨饭也无路，五年十年也翻不过身来！”
    去年在战胜自然灾害中，全县范围内的合作社形成了一支有组织、有领导的劳动军，例如五洲乡曾调动了一千二百多人，支援常安乡挑沙开田，恢复生产；江丰、三联、渔山等乡一声号令，就出动了三百余人，星夜赶到大青、三桥等地抢收早稻；许多轻灾区的合作社也都出人出牛，帮助重灾区合作社恢复生产。灾区的农民普遍反映：天下合作社是一家，风灾雨灾都不怕。
    富阳县在深重的灾害中的丰收，就是这样得来的。
