Reactions to Criticism

    A letter from the Fuzhou Civil Affairs Bureau: The People's Daily's December 30th, last year, fourth page, "Everyone is Happy" criticized us for using public funds to treat people to see a play. This criticism is correct. Although this matter was approved by the higher authorities, it was mainly caused by the vulgar work style that exists within us, and we are determined to correct it in the future.

    对批评的反应
    福州市民政局来信：人民日报去年12月30日四版“皆大欢喜”批评我们用公款请客看戏。这一批评是正确的。此事虽经上级批准，但主要是由于我们存在的庸俗作风所造成的，我们决心今后改正。
