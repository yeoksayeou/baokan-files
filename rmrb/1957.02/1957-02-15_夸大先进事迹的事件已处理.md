The meeting held that, in addition to Yang Xuanqi himself bearing certain responsibility for not making a factual statement to the Party to correct the exaggerated deeds after being rated as an A-level advanced producer in the bureau, the Party branch of the construction site should bear major responsibility. The meeting launched criticism of the shortcomings of the Party branch of the construction site in leading the collation of Yang Xuanqi's materials and cultivating advanced figures. Hu Xiuchuan, chairman of the construction site's trade union who was responsible for collating Yang Xuanqi's materials, also made a self-criticism.

    夸大先进事迹的事件已处理
    中南第二工程公司二○四工地油漆工青年突击队队长杨宣起先进事迹被夸大的事件，在1956年11月29日人民日报公开批评以后，有关部门已作了认真严肃的处理。
    二○四工地党支部在上级党委指示下，召开了党员大会。大会认为，这一事件，除杨宣起本人在被评为局里甲等先进生产者以后，没有对被夸大的事迹据实向党声明更正，应负一定责任外，工地党支部应负重大责任。大会对工地党支部在领导整理杨宣起的材料和培养先进人物方面的缺点开展了批评。负责整理杨宣起材料的工地工会主席胡秀川也作了检讨。
    中南工程管理总局党委监察委员会根据中南第二工程公司党委监察委员会的处理意见，决定：建议除保留青年突击队荣誉称号外，取消杨宣起甲等先进生产者和青年突击手的光荣称号；胡秀川是夸大杨宣起先进事迹的主要的直接的责任者，建议行政上给予记过处分（二公司已给予行政记过处分）；二公司党、工会和青年团组织，在评选先进生产者工作上有严重的官僚主义作风，应该进行检查，吸取教训，改进工作；二○四工地党支部书记刘继法在此事过程中也有错误，责成他在工地支部大会上作深刻检讨。　　　　　（季万）
