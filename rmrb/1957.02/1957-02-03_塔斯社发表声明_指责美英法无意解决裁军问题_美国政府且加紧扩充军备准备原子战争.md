Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. TASS issued a statement on February 1 regarding the disarmament issue.

The TASS statement said that world public opinion welcomed with satisfaction the proposals put forward in the Soviet government's statement of November 17, 1956, on the issue of disarmament and easing international tension, considering it a major contribution to solving the disarmament issue.

The Soviet government, in line with its consistent peaceful foreign policy, has proposed suggestions for a swift solution to the issues of arms reduction and the prohibition of nuclear weapons. Hoping to lay the foundation for the concrete realization of a disarmament plan, and hoping to untie the knot in this issue, the Soviet government, over many years of negotiations on disarmament, has more than once accommodated the Western countries and adopted their suggestions. However, the experience of disarmament negotiations proves that whenever the Soviet government accepts the proposals of the United States and other Western countries in order to reach an agreement, they retreat and abandon the suggestions they themselves put forward.

From the replies of Mr. Eisenhower, Mr. Eden, and Mr. Mollet to the Soviet Premier Bulganin regarding the Soviet government's statement, it can be seen that the governments of the three Western countries avoid directly answering the suggestions put forward in the Soviet government's statement in substance. They themselves cannot put forward any concrete measures that would enable the disarmament issue to be resolved and international tension to be eased. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France merely state in general terms that it would be best to entrust the entire disarmament issue to the United Nations Disarmament Commission and its subcommittee. This attitude will not promote the speedy resolution of the disarmament issue.

At the same time, one cannot fail to pay attention to the fact that the United States has recently taken some steps to intensify arms expansion, including stepping up the manufacture of atomic weapons.

Everyone knows that the State of the Union Address presented by the US President to Congress on January 10 called for further expansion of the US armed forces, which, according to him, are already "the most powerful in peacetime history." The US budget draft for the 1957-58 fiscal year, published not long ago, stipulates that military appropriations be increased to 45.3 billion US dollars, accounting for 63% of the total national budget expenditure.

The new plan proposed by the US government to establish and station special forces equipped with atomic weapons in other countries' territories proves that the US ruling clique is stepping up preparations for an atomic war. At the same time, the United States is continuing to intensify the arming of its allies in the aggressive blocs. The meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council held last December adopted a decision to strengthen military cooperation within this alliance, with the United States using so-called "tactical" atomic weapons to equip the armies of its European partners, including West Germany. The US Secretary of State emphasized at this meeting that the US government has decided not to withdraw its troops from Europe, and he firmly insisted that the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should speed up the completion of the task of handing over their troops to the command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters, in which generals of the Hitler army are playing an increasingly important role.

All these measures taken by the United States clearly show what value there is in the US government's words that it loves peace and seeks to reach a disarmament agreement.

The TASS statement said that the Soviet government believes that discussing the Soviet proposals immediately, whether within or outside the UN framework, or discussing the proposals of other countries, would help bring the positions of all countries closer and help reach a disarmament agreement. The replies of the US, British, and French governments can only be said to be attempts to evade discussing this issue and to postpone the issue indefinitely without resolving it. The delegations of the United States, Britain, and France refused to discuss the substantive issues of disarmament at the current session of the UN General Assembly and took various measures to prevent the UN General Assembly from adopting any resolutions on the substantive issues of disarmament.

The result of all this is that the UN General Assembly has once again failed to adopt a concrete resolution on the disarmament issue. If one considers that among the members of the UN subcommittee, which has once again been commissioned to review all suggestions related to disarmament, in addition to the Soviet Union, there are also the United States, Britain, and France, as well as Canada, which holds the same attitude as them, and considering that the policies of these countries are aimed at continuing arms expansion and that they are all members of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc, then it is not difficult to understand why the Western countries continue to pursue the tactic of delaying the discussion of suggestions related to disarmament. The fact that the Western countries do not welcome the Soviet proposal to expand the membership of the UN Disarmament Commission and its subcommittee can only be explained by this.

The TASS statement concluded by saying that the Soviet proposals on disarmament and easing international tension have so far failed to receive the support they deserve from the United States, Britain, and France, although these proposals could serve as a good basis for negotiations. Reportedly, Soviet leaders express regret about this. Such an attitude toward the Soviet proposals cannot prove that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have the desire to promote a solution to the disarmament issue. As long as someone is not just verbally, but actually worried about the current arms expansion and its consequences, he would not fail to welcome the concrete proposals put forward by the Soviet government aimed at breaking the deadlock in this issue, and aimed at implementing practical steps to reduce arms and troops, prohibit nuclear weapons, and eliminate the danger of a new war.

### 塔斯社发表声明  指责美英法无意解决裁军问题  美国政府且加紧扩充军备准备原子战争

    塔斯社发表声明
    指责美英法无意解决裁军问题
    美国政府且加紧扩充军备准备原子战争
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社2月1日就裁军问题发表了一项声明。
    塔斯社声明说，世界舆论满意地欢迎苏联政府1956年11月17日关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势问题的声明中提出的建议，认为它是对解决裁军问题的一个重大贡献。
    苏联政府本着它一贯的和平外交政策，提出关于迅速解决缩减军备和禁止核子武器问题的建议。由于希望为具体实现裁军计划奠定基础，希望解开这个问题的死结，苏联政府多年来在关于裁军问题的谈判过程中，曾经不止一次地去迎合西方国家，并采纳它们的建议。但是裁军谈判的经验证明，每逢苏联政府为达成协议而接受了美国和其他西方国家的建议的时候，它们就向后倒退，把它们自己提出的建议都抛弃了。
    从艾森豪威尔先生、艾登先生、摩勒先生就苏联政府的声明给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的回信中可以看出，三个西方国家的政府避免从实质上直接回答苏联政府声明中提出的建议。他们自己也提不出什么具体的、能使裁军问题获得解决和缓和国际紧张局势的措施。美、英、法三国政府仅仅是一般地声明：最好是把整个裁军问题托付给联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会。这种态度绝不会促进裁军问题的尽速解决。
    同时，不能不注意这样一个事实，最近美国采取了一些步骤来加紧扩充军备，包括加紧制造原子武器。
    大家知道，美国总统1月10日向国会提出的国情咨文，号召进一步扩充美国的武装部队，而照他所说，美国的武装部队已经是“有史以来在和平时期的实力最雄厚的”了。不久以前公布的美国1957—58财政年度预算草案规定，军事拨款增加到四百五十三亿美元，即占国家预算全部开支的63％。
    美国政府提出的关于建立和在别国领土上驻扎配备拥有原子武器的特种部队的新计划证明，美国统治集团在加紧准备原子战争。美国同时还在继续加紧武装它在侵略集团中的同盟国。去年12月举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议通过决定，要加强这个联盟内部的军事合作，由美国用所谓“战术上的”原子武器来装备包括西德在内的它的欧洲伙伴们的军队。美国国务卿在这个会议上强调说，美国政府决定不从欧洲撤出它的军队，他并且坚决主张，北大西洋公约组织的欧洲成员国应加紧完成把军队交给北大西洋公约组织统帅部支配这一任务，而在这一统帅部中，希特勒军队的将领们在担当着越来越重要的角色。
    美国的所有这些措施明显地表明，美国政府说它爱好和平和力求达成裁军协议的那些话究竟有什么价值。
    塔斯社声明说，苏联政府认为，无论在联合国机构内或是在联合国之外立刻来讨论苏联的建议也好，讨论其他国家的建议也好，都将有助于使各国的主张接近和有助于达成裁军协议。而美国、英国和法国政府的答复，只能说它是企图回避讨论这个问题和无限期地把问题拖延下去不加解决。美、英、法三国代表团拒绝在联合国大会本届会议上讨论裁军的实质问题，并且采取了种种措施，不让联合国大会就裁军的实质问题通过任何决议。
    这一切的结果就是，联合国大会这一次又没有能通过关于裁军问题的具体决议。如果考虑到，在又一次受命审查有关裁军的一切建议的联合国小组委员会的成员中，除了苏联以外，还是美国、英国和法国以及同它们抱同样态度的加拿大，考虑到这些国家的政策都是以继续扩充军备为宗旨，它们都是侵略性的北大西洋集团的成员国，那末就不难理解，为什么西方国家照旧奉行拖延讨论有关裁军问题的建议的策略。西方国家不欢迎苏联提出的关于扩大联合国裁军委员会及其小组委员会成员的建议，也只能用这一点来说明。
    塔斯社声明最后说，苏联关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的建议，至今未能得到美国、英国、法国方面应有的支持，虽然这些建议可以成为谈判的良好基础，据悉，苏联领导人士对此表示遗憾。对苏联建议抱这样一种态度，不能够证明美、英、法三国政府有促成裁军问题解决的愿望。只要谁不是口头上、而是实际上对目前的扩充军备及其后果表示担心，他就不会不欢迎苏联政府提出的旨在打开这一问题的僵局的具体建议，旨在实行裁减军备和军队的实际步骤、禁止核子武器、消除新战争危险的建议。
