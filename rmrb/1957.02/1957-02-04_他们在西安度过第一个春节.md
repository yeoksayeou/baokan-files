    In the past three years, Xi'an's vigorously developing large-scale construction projects have attracted many people from other places every year. Last year, another 83,000 people came. They settled down in this city, worked with the people of Xi'an, watered their knowledge and talents with hard work, and blossomed everywhere in the construction cause. In these past two days, amidst the sound of firecrackers, they celebrated their first Spring Festival in Xi'an together with the local people.

    The Chief Engineers' Gathering on New Year's Day
    On the morning of New Year's Day, when reporters arrived at the new home of Chen Duanbing, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Xi'an Electric Power Design Branch, they encountered Xu Guozhang, Deputy Director; Li Deqing, Chief Engineer; and Chen Jiayuan, Deputy Chief Engineer, who had come to pay New Year's greetings. The hospitable host, according to Shanghai custom, first invited the guests to drink a cup of sweet tea made with red dates and longans, and then invited everyone to share a bowl of eight-treasure rice.
    At this time, snowflakes were flying outside the window, but several pots of winter plum and crabapple blossoms inside had already bloomed. After everyone had eaten and drank, they gathered around the stove to chat. Xu Guozhang said with a smile: "The indoor temperature in Xi'an is warmer than in Shanghai. Deputy Chief Engineer Chen has a small weather station that keeps records." Chen Duanbing, with his gray hair, carefully introduced that he had been keeping weather records for more than 20 years, and he himself wore two fewer cotton undershirts here. Then, the guests began to enumerate the advantages of Xi'an. Chen Jiayuan, in his fifties, liked Xi'an's sunny and dry weather, which was helpful to his health. He also praised the quietness of the residential area of the Design Branch. Everyone laughed and said that Chen Jiayuan's insomnia had been cured. Li Deqing, who had lived in the United States for more than ten years, was very interested in Xi'an's historical sites. He planned to move his family to Xi'an to live this summer. His wife would teach at a foreign language institute here. At this moment, the door was pushed open, and a group of young technicians crowded in, noisily raising their hands high and saying to the chief engineers: "Congratulations! Congratulations!" The chief engineers all stood up and clasped their hands in return: Congratulations, congratulations. Xu Guozhang smiled: "You see, we've all gained weight since coming to Xi'an."
    The reporter asked them: Do you feel any inconvenience in your life in Xi'an? Everyone was silent for a while, as if it was not worth mentioning. But the reporter knew in advance that the chief engineers' current living conditions were worse than in Shanghai. For example, Li Deqing had his own house and car in Shanghai. Later, Xu Guozhang's words expressed their common sentiments: "We have come to participate in the construction of the Great Northwest and are willing to contribute our strength wholeheartedly. Those temporary inconveniences in life are all overcome when compared with our career. Lenin said that technicians experience communism through their work. That is how we treat the country's magnificent construction cause!"

    "Divine Soldiers" Talk About Initial Victory on New Year's Eve
    The more than one hundred installation workers from Harbin who came to Xi'an had a particularly pleasant New Year's Eve. The reporter went with Li Yuanjing, the work area director, to the home of Li Xiangrui, the fitter foreman. At the reporter's request, Li Xiangrui talked about the situation in which they had won a victory as soon as they arrived in Xi'an: "We exceeded our January task by the 27th. We have installed more than forty machines in Xi'an beyond the plan!" Then, Li Xiangrui humorously said: "When we work in the Northeast, people there look down on us young people without mustaches. As soon as we left the construction site, hey, they publicly declared us to be divine soldiers." Li Yuanjing interjected: "Actually, there's nothing divine about it. Taking the official construction period of more than two months in Xi'an as an example, at first, there were not enough water level instruments, so we borrowed a few and worked for three nights, and the task was not delayed."
    Yu Shouchun, the chairman of the labor union, also came. Li Xiangrui dragged the reporter to their lively recreation room for a visit. As we squeezed out of the recreation room, some workers were smiling and walking in. The reporter also took a walk through the three-story family residential building. Most families were making dumplings all night long according to their hometown customs. The finished dumplings were placed all over the table and kang. In the corridors, children ran around carrying lighted red lanterns. Someone's radio was playing "Wang Ersao Spends the New Year." Yu Shouchun pointed to the brightly lit dance floor next door and said: "The girls and boys have all gone dancing!" When the enthusiastic Li Xiangrui said goodbye to the reporter, he repeatedly instructed: "Come again after the Spring Festival. We will continue to work in Xi'an for six or seven years!"

    Newlyweds Spend a Happy Holiday
    On New Year's Eve, there was joy in the new house of textile worker Yao Xiufang. Two brand-new quilts were displayed on the double bed, and the mirror on the wall with the red "?" character was framed with her and her lover's wedding photos. The bride put several dishes of her hometown cuisine on the table, chatting and laughing with her lover while eating New Year's Eve dinner. After dinner, they both went to participate in the dance party in "Textile City" and danced until late at night. On the morning of the first day, they ate Yuanxiao and went to see a movie together.
    "Didn't you originally want to go back to Shanghai for the festival?" the reporter asked her.
    She said with a smile: "It is of course happy to reunite with my parents during the Spring Festival in my hometown, but it is equally pleasant to spend the festival in Xi'an. As soon as I arrived in Xi'an, I fell in love with this new factory, and in the first year, I established a new small family, so I had already planned to settle down here and work together with everyone to build the motherland's Xi'an."
    This quiet and talkative bride had worked as a winding machine operator in a textile factory in Shanghai for four or five years. After arriving at the state-owned Northwest Fourth Cotton Textile Factory last May, she exceeded her task every month and never produced any defective products. Not long after arriving in Xi'an, she met Zhang Dingyi, a cadre, in "Textile City." They often strolled and talked on holidays, and Zhang Dingyi helped her study culture when he was free. In this way, their love deepened, and they became husband and wife this New Year's Day.
    In "Textile City," there are also several thousand textile girls who came from Shanghai last year, and they all chose their favorite recreational activities to celebrate the Spring Festival happily.

    Paying New Year's Greetings to Old Professors
    On the first day of the New Year, the first thing Zhao Fuxin, a physics professor at Jiaotong University, said to the reporter was: "We are having a very good Spring Festival in Xi'an." He was the first professor at Jiaotong University to propose a thrifty Spring Festival. Today, he served a cup of clear tea, two plates of candy, and peanuts to entertain guests. But the joy of the holiday was not diminished at all. His youngest daughter held a large doll and performed a song and dance of "Patting the Doll" for the guests who came to pay New Year's greetings. Amidst laughter and singing, the doorbell rang, and a group of teachers came in smiling to pay them New Year's greetings. Zhao Fuxin immediately happily introduced to the reporter that these were the teachers of the Physics Teaching and Research Group. At this time, his wife, Wang Yuanzhen, took a letter that she had just received today and gave it to him. It was from the students of Class 53 of the second grade of the Electrical Engineering and Machine Manufacturing major, congratulating him on the Spring Festival. Everyone talked about how Jiaotong University had enrolled more new students in Xi'an this semester, but the number of professors in the Physics Teaching and Research Group had decreased, and the number of new teaching assistants had increased. They used the method of mentoring apprentices to help the teaching assistants start classes, and used the power of the collective to research and improve teaching quality from all aspects. The results of the final exams showed that the students' grades were generally very good. Speaking of this, Zhao Fuxin said: "In the future, the factories in Xi'an will be related to the majors offered by Jiaotong University. We have the confidence and enthusiasm to run Jiaotong University in Xi'an even better."

    Reminiscing About the Past and Welcoming the New Year on New Year's Eve
    On New Year's Eve, sewing master Yu Zhizeng invited tailor Wang Tingfang and old sewing master Zhang Ajiang, whose family had not yet moved, from the sewing department of the service store in Xi'an City to have New Year's Eve dinner. They were all colleagues who had moved from Shanghai to Xi'an City last year. The hostess cooked a winter bamboo shoot stir-fry with assorted vegetables according to her hometown taste and served a bottle of Shaanxi's famous Xifeng wine, which was particularly appreciated by the guests. After dinner, the hosts and guests chatted around the table until late at night.
    Everyone said that they were particularly satisfied with their work in the period before the Spring Festival during their five months of living in Xi'an. In a short period of time, they rushed to make 840 pieces of clothing so that people could wear new clothes for the Spring Festival. They all said that it was a blessing to do more for the people building Xi'an. After drinking, old sewing master Zhang Ajiang talked emotionally about how he had learned his craft at the age of sixteen and had been displaced in the old society for half his life, always having to raise money everywhere during festivals. He said: "Today's society is different, and all kinds of work are respected. I am not afraid that no one will take care of me. When I think of these things, I am full of energy for work."

    他们在西安度过第一个春节
        新华社驻西安记者集体采写
    西安市近三年间蓬勃展开的大规模建设事业，年年都吸引许多外地人到这里来。去年，又来了八万三千多人。他们在这座城市安家立业，和西安人民在一起，用辛勤的劳动灌溉着自己的学识和才能，在建设事业上到处开花结果。这两天，在爆竹声中，他们又和当地人一起欢度来西安后第一个春节。
    总工程师们年初一的聚会
    年初一早晨，记者到西安电力设计分院副总工程师陈端柄在西安的新居时，正遇上副院长徐国璋、总工程师李德庆、副总工程师陈嘉元到这里拜年。好客的主人按上海习惯，先请客人们喝一杯用红枣和桂圆煮成的甜茶，然后再请大家分吃一满盆八宝饭。
    这时，窗外飞舞着雪花，室内几盆春梅和海棠却已开放鲜花。大家吃完喝罢，便围炉聊起天来。徐国璋笑着说：“西安室内的气温比上海暖和，陈副总工程师就有一个小气象台做了记录。”头发灰白的陈端柄认真地介绍：他已做了二十多年气象记录，他本人在这里就少穿两件棉毛衫。接着，客人们就数说起西安的优点来。五十多岁的陈嘉元喜欢西安的天气晴燥，这对他身体有帮助，他还夸奖设计分院的住宅区宁静。大家就哄笑起来说：陈嘉元的失眠症被治好了。在美国生活了十几年的李德庆对西安的名胜古迹十分感兴趣。他计划在今年暑假，把家搬到西安来住。他爱人将到这里一个外文学院教书。这时，门被推开了，一伙青年技术人员拥进来，闹烘烘地高高拱起双手，向总工程师们连说：“恭喜！恭喜！”总工程师们都站起来也拱手回贺：恭喜，恭喜。徐国璋微笑起来：“你看，我们来西安都长胖了。”
    记者问他们：在西安感到生活上有什么不便吗？大家反而沉默了一会，好像这事不值得一提。而记者事先知道，总工程师们现在的生活条件是比上海差的。像李德庆在上海就有自己的楼房和汽车。后来，徐国璋的一番话算表达了他们共同的心意：“我们来参加建设大西北，都愿全心全意贡献自己的力量。那些暂时的生活不方便，和事业一比就全克服掉了。列宁说过，技术人员体会共产主义是通过自己的工作。我们就是这样对待国家宏伟建设事业的！”
    “神兵”除夕话初捷
    哈尔滨来西安的一百多个安装工人，除夕过得特别惬意。记者同工区主任李元景到钳工工长厉祥瑞家里。厉祥瑞应记者的要求，谈了他们来西安就打了胜仗的情形：“今年1月份的任务在27号就超额了。我们来西安一共超计划安装了四十多台机器！”接着，厉祥瑞幽默地说：“在东北干活，到那儿先都瞧不上我们这批不带小胡子的年轻人。一离开工地，嘿，就当众宣布我们是神兵。”李元景插嘴说：“其实也没啥神的。拿到西安两个多月正式工期来说，起先水正仪不够用，就借了几台干了三个晚上，任务就没拉下。”
    工会主席于寿春也来了。厉祥瑞拖着记者到他们热闹非凡的文娱室去玩了一遭。我们挤出文娱室时，一些工人笑嘻嘻地正走进来。记者又在三层楼家属住宅走了一遭，大多数人家正在按家乡风俗连夜捏饺子，捏好了的饺子摆得满桌满炕。楼廊里，孩子们提了盏点亮的红灯笼跑来跑去。谁家的电匣子正播放“王二嫂过年”。于寿春指指楼隔壁红亮亮的舞场说：“姑娘、小伙子们都跳舞去啦！”热情的厉祥瑞和记者告别时，一再嘱咐：“春节后再来吧，我们要在西安继续工作六、七年哩！”
        新婚夫妇度佳节
    除夕晚上，纺织女工姚秀纺的新房里，喜气洋洋。双人床上陈设着两床崭新的被子，墙上挂的写有红“?”字镜子里，镶着她和爱人的新婚照片。新娘把自己亲手做的几样家乡菜端上桌，和爱人边谈边笑地吃着年夜饭。饭后，他们双双赶去参加“纺织城”里的舞会，一直跳到深夜。初一早晨吃了元宵，又一起看电影去了。
    “你原不想回上海过节吗？”记者问她。
    她笑盈盈说：“在家乡和父母春节团聚当然幸福，不过在西安过节也同样的愉快。我一到西安就爱上了这个新的工厂，又在第一个年头，建立了新的小家庭，所以，我早已就打算在这儿安家立业，和大家一同来建设祖国的西安。”
    这个娴静而健谈的新娘原在上海的纺织厂里做了四、五年络筒值车工人。去年5月来到国营西北第四棉纺织厂后，月月超额完成任务，并且没有出过一次废品。来西安不久，便在“纺织城”里认识了干部张定一。他们常在假日一同漫步谈心，张定一有空就帮助她学习文化。这样，两人爱情日深，在今年元旦成了夫妇。
    在“纺织城”里，还有几千个去年才从上海来的纺织姑娘，也都各自选择自己爱好的文娱活动，欢度春节。
        向老教授拜年
    大年初一，交通大学物理学教授赵福鑫见记者的第一句话是：“我们在西安的春节过得很好。”他是交通大学第一个提出俭朴过春节的教授。今天，他端出一杯清茶、两碟糖果和花生米来招待客人。但节日的欢乐毫未减色。他的小女儿抱了个大洋娃娃，给拜年的客人们表演“拍拍布娃娃”的歌舞。在欢笑和歌舞声中，门铃响了起来，一批教师笑嘻嘻地进来给他们拜年。赵福鑫立即高兴地向记者介绍，这是物理学教研组的教师们。这时，他的爱人王元蓁拿了一封今天刚收到的信给他，这是电机及机器制造专业二年级五三班学生向他恭贺春节的。大家就谈起交通大学这学期在西安多招收了新生，但物理学教研组的教授却减少了，新助教增加了。他们就用带徒弟的方法帮助助教开课，运用集体的力量从各方面研究改进教学质量。期终考试结果，学生的成绩一般都很好。谈到这里，赵福鑫说：“将来西安的工厂和交通大学所设专业都有联系，我们有信心，有热情把在西安的交通大学办得更好。”
        话旧迎新过除夕
    缝纫师俞只增，在除夕请剪裁师王庭芳和家眷尚未搬来的老缝纫师张阿江吃年夜饭。他们都是去年从上海搬来西安市的服务商店缝纫部的同事。主妇按家乡口味，烧一只冬笋炒什锦，和一瓶陕西著名的西凤酒，特别受到客人的赞赏。饭后，主客围桌一直畅谈到深夜。
    大家说在西安五个多月的生活中特别对春节前一段工作感到满意。他们在短短时间里，赶制了八百四十件衣裳，使人民穿上新衣过春节。他们都说：为建设西安的人们多做一些事情是幸福的。老缝纫师张阿江酒后兴浓，感慨地谈到他十六岁学手艺，半辈子都在旧社会颠沛流离，逢年逢节总要到处筹钱。他说：“如今社会不同了，行行工作都受尊重。我也不怕没人照顾，一想这些，工作就是一身劲。”
