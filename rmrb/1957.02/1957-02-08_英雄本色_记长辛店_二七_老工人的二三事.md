Heroic Qualities
    ——Anecdotes of Veteran "February 7th" Workers in Changxindian
        Xinhua News Agency reporter Ren Zhiqiao

    In Changxindian, a place with a glorious revolutionary tradition, many veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" General Strike still retain their heroic qualities from that time.
        Model Mentor
    Sun Maolin, a 58-year-old "February 7th" veteran worker and compressed air driver in the Power Workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, was assigned a female apprentice, Zhang Zhaomin, to train new compressed air drivers. This young woman was initially emotional and unwilling to work, believing that mastering compressed air machines required patience, something more suited for older people, and not appropriate for young people. Sun Maolin thought: The state assigned her to the compressed air room, entrusting her to me! Therefore, whenever he had the opportunity, he would talk about the "February 7th" revolutionary struggle and the difficulties he faced learning the technology in the past to educate Zhang Zhaomin. Once, he asked Zhang Zhaomin: You are a member of the Communist Youth League, what did you say when you raised your hand to take the oath before Chairman Mao's portrait? Zhang Zhaomin said: "Being a compressed air driver is not a job for girls." He then told her the story of Tian Guiying becoming a train driver, saying, are you giving up on being a compressed air driver just because of the difficulties? Through this veteran worker's multifaceted care and patient education, Zhang Zhaomin was deeply moved and soon changed her attitude, actively studying the technology. Last year, she was rated as a fourth-grade technician. When Zhang Zhaomin was elected as an activist among the youth in the entire factory, the Communist Youth League organization also issued a certificate of merit to Sun Maolin, and people praised the two of them as "model mentor and apprentice."
        Production Expert
    "February 7th" veteran worker Yao Desheng has been elected as an advanced producer of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory several times. He is a "wheel removal" worker, constantly studying "wheel removal" technology. Once, a locomotive in the workshop could not be repaired after more than ten attempts because the axle distance was incorrect, and it was decided to hand it over to their group for repair. At that time, some young workers were afraid of difficulties and unwilling to accept this task. Yao Desheng said to them, the more difficult the work, the more we have to do it. Only by overcoming difficulties can we gain experience. If production is always smooth, then a person's skills will never improve. Under his leadership, the entire group completed the repair of the locomotive on schedule. In 1956, it took eight or nine hours to remove a locomotive wheel, affecting the completion of the entire workshop's production plan. Yao Desheng was very anxious, often pondering this key issue even while eating and sleeping. Later, he heard that the Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory had an advanced experience of "rapid wheel removal" that only took two hours. After their research and experimentation, they created a new record of removing a wheel in one minute and five seconds, greatly shortening the locomotive repair cycle. At the same time, he and worker Han Zheng also researched an advanced working method for "rapid spring adjustment," which shortened the spring adjustment work from an average of twenty-four hours in the past to one and a half hours.
        Treating People Like Family
    Zuo Shijun, the administrator of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's guesthouse, is already a 68-year-old man with graying hair. It is said that he should have retired long ago, but whenever people mention this, he always says: I am a Communist Party member and a veteran "February 7th" worker, and I am very healthy, why should I retire? I want to dedicate my life's strength to the Party!

    Zuo Shijun used to be a lathe worker. After liberation, because of his age, the factory leadership mobilized him to retire, but he was always unwilling. In 1953, in order to take care of him, the leadership mobilized him to work in the guesthouse. He said: As long as I can contribute my strength, any place is the same. Zuo Shijun arrived at the guesthouse and felt that this job entrusted to him by the Party was very important, and he was determined to do it well.

    From 1953 onwards, Zuo Shijun looked after the guests coming to the factory day and night. Once, a group of Vietnamese interns came, and Zuo Shijun, fearing that they would not be acclimatized to the environment, often asked them about their well-being. On winter nights, he would often gently cover them with quilts, close the windows, and add coal to the stoves. When the Vietnamese interns returned to their country, many people shed tears, reluctant to leave this kind and amiable Chinese elder.

    In Zuo Shijun's office, there are many pennants, inscriptions, and plaques, fully expressing people's respect and love for this veteran "February 7th" worker.

    英雄本色
    ——记长辛店“二七”老工人的二三事
        新华社记者　任志樵
    在长辛店这个有着光荣革命传统的地方，许多曾经参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人，现在仍不失当年的英雄本色。
        模范师傅
    长辛店机车车辆修理工厂动力车间压风司机孙茂林，是个五十八岁的“二七”老工人。工厂里为了训练新的压风司机，就派了一个女学徒张兆敏请他培养。这个女孩子一来就闹情绪，不愿干，认为掌握压风机要有耐心，是老年人干的事，年青人作起来不合适。孙茂林想：国家分配她到压风室来，就是把她交给我啦！于是他遇到机会总是要讲讲“二七”革命斗争的情况和自己从前学习技术的困难来教育张兆敏。有一次，他问张兆敏：你是个团员，在毛主席像前举手宣誓的时候怎么说的？张兆敏说：“压风司机不是女孩子干的事。”他便给她讲田桂英当火车司机的故事，他说，难道你就因为困难不能当压风司机吗？经过这位老工人多方面的关怀和耐心的教育，张兆敏很受感动，不久就转变过来了，积极钻研技术，去年被评为四级技工。在张兆敏当选为全厂青年积极分子的时候，青年团组织也发给了孙茂林一张奖状，人们称赞他们两个人叫“模范师徒”。
        生产能手
    “二七”老工人姚德胜，已经当选过好几次长辛店机车车辆修理工厂的先进生产者了。他是个“落车”工，成天钻研“落车”技术。有一次，车间里有一台机车因为大轴距离不对，十几次都没有修好，决定交给他们小组修理。当时有些青年工人怕困难，不愿意接受这个任务。姚德胜对他们说，活越困难就越得干，只有克服了困难才能长经验，如果生产中总是很顺利，那人的技术永远也不会提高。全组工人在他的带动下按期修完了这台机车。1956年，机车落一次车要八、九小时，影响整个车间生产计划的完成。姚德胜非常急，吃饭睡觉的时候也常常琢磨这个关键问题。后来听说唐山机车车辆修理工厂有个“快速落车”的先进经验，只需要两个小时。经过他们研究试验，创造了一点零五分钟落车新纪录，大大缩短了机车修理的周期。同时，他和工人韩政一起，又研究出“快速调簧”的先进工作方法，使调一次簧的工作从过去平均二十四小时缩短到一个半小时。
        待人如亲
    长辛店机车车辆修理工厂招待所的管理员左士俊，已经是六十八岁须发花白的老人了。按说，他早就应该退休养老，可是每当人们提起这件事，他总是说：我是个共产党员，又是“二七”老工人，身体很壮实，干么要退休？我要把一生的力量贡献给党！
    左士俊原来是个旋床工，解放以后因为他年纪大了，工厂领导方面动员他退休养老，他一直不愿意。到1953年，领导方面为了照顾他，动员他到招待所工作。他表示：只要能贡献我的力量，什么地方都一样。左士俊到了招待所，认为党交给的这个工作很重要，下决心要把它做好。
    从1953年起，左士俊就不分日夜地照看着到工厂里来的客人。有一次，越南来了一批实习生，左士俊怕他们水土不服，经常去问寒问暖；在冬天的夜里，常常轻手轻脚地去为他们盖被子、关窗户、给炉子添煤炭。当越南实习生回国的时候，很多人都流下眼泪，舍不得离开这位和蔼可亲的中国老人。
    在左士俊的办公室里，挂满了锦旗、题字和匾额，充分表示了人们对这位“二七”老工人的尊敬和爱戴。
