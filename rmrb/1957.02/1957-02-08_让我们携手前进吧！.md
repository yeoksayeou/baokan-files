    Let Us Join Hands and Advance Together!
      Ruan Mingliang, Member of the Vietnamese Commercial Delegation
    Our wish has come true: We happily boarded the international through train to great China. The train moved forward swiftly, but we still felt it was too slow. We looked forward to seeing China, which has been enthusiastically helping us, the beautiful Beijing that everyone in the world knows, and our dear Chinese friends even sooner.
    Station after station passed, but unfortunately, it was already dark when the train entered Chinese territory. That night, we tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. The next morning, we crowded to the window. Ah! We saw it, we saw the beautiful land of China. From then on, our eyes never left the train window. We were intoxicated as we watched the chimneys of the factories smoking in the distance, the people working diligently in the fields, the newly built buildings, the beautiful and prosperous cities and the villages living happily and peacefully; and also, we watched the Yangtze River Bridge, which will soon be world-famous... There was so much! These scenes were continuously imprinted in our minds, making us feel relaxed and happy. But we were not satisfied, our wishes were not just these! Our destination had not yet arrived! We waited patiently. Finally, the lovely Beijing that we had imagined for so long, appeared before us in the brilliant lights. We stared wide-eyed and carefully looked at her. Dear Beijing! How beautiful and magnificent you are! Let us pay our respects to you! Beijing! The Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world are proud of you, your name already makes the imperialists shrink and tremble at the mere mention of it. Beijing! We feel very honored to be able to meet you, and to strengthen our friendship with our Chinese friends here. Dear Chinese friends! How can we forget you, how can we forget the life filled with friendship that we lived with you in the land of your great motherland - a life that was short but very precious and meaningful! Every day we spend here, we feel as warm as in the embrace of our own beloved motherland. You care about us in every way, you are so good to us. We came to China this time to learn, and we received your generous and selfless help, which reminded us of Comrade Chen Guoping, a Chinese expert who sacrificed his life for our Vietnamese socialist construction, and other comrades, as well as the Chinese experts who are still selflessly helping us in our country. Their names and their noble deeds have been forever engraved in the hearts of the Vietnamese people. Here we have seen your lofty internationalist spirit again. With the experience of being one step ahead of us, you have passed on to us everything you have learned in the arduous struggle. We will not let you down, believe us! We have our beloved and wise leader President Ho Chi Minh, and the vanguard of the working class – the Vietnamese Labor Party – to lead the way, and with you helping and encouraging us, we will surely win!
    Dear Chinese friends! We have seen your great motherland, and we love her as we love our own beautiful motherland; we have seen your beautiful capital - Beijing, and we love her as we love our own beloved capital; we have seen you and understand you very well, and we love you as we love our own brothers and sisters. China, Vietnam, Beijing, Hanoi are forever linked together, and the hearts of the Chinese and Vietnamese people are also forever linked together. Our friendship is eternal, like the water in the river that flows forever, and our common goal - communist society - is consistent. Let us join hands and advance side by side!

    让我们携手前进吧！
      越南商业参观团团员　阮明亮
    我们的愿望实现了：我们愉快地搭上了国际联运火车到伟大的中国去。火车飞快地前进，但我们还觉得它走得太慢了。我们盼望着更快一些看到热情地帮助我们的中国，看到世界上无人不知的美丽的北京，看到我们亲爱的中国朋友们。
    一站又一站过去了，可惜的是火车进入中国大地时天已经黑了。那天晚上，我们翻来复去老是睡不着。第二天一早，我们就拥到窗前。啊！我们看到了，看到了中国美丽的土地。自此开始，一路上我们的眼睛一直没有离开过车窗，我们陶醉地望着远远冒着烟的工厂的烟囱，望着正在田野上辛勤劳动着的人群，望着新建筑的楼房，望着美丽而繁荣的城市和正在和平气氛中过着愉快幸福生活的村庄；还有，我们望着不久以后就将闻名世界的长江大桥……多着呢！这一些景象就这样接连不断地刻印在我们脑海里，使得我们轻松愉快。但是我们还没有满意，我们的愿望不只是这一些呀！我们的目的地还没有到呢！我们耐心地等待着。终于长期以来在我们想像中的可爱的北京，在灯光辉煌下摆在我们眼前了。我们瞪大眼睛仔细地打量着她。亲爱的北京！你是多么美丽多么雄壮呀！让我们向你致敬吧！北京！中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民为你而骄傲，你的名字已经使帝国主义者一听就畏缩、发抖。北京！我们感到非常荣幸地能够同你见面，并在你这里增强我们和中国朋友们的友谊。亲爱的中国朋友们！我们怎能忘记你们，怎能忘记在你们伟大祖国的土地上和你们一起过着洋溢着友谊的生活——时间虽然短速，但是非常宝贵非常有意义的生活呢！我们在你们这里一天，就一天感到像在自己可爱的祖国怀抱里一样的温暖，你们样样都关心我们，你们对我们太好了。我们这一次到中国来学习，得到你们慷慨无私的帮助，使我们联想到曾经为我们越南社会主义建设事业而牺牲了的中国专家陈国平同志和其他各位同志，以及还在我们祖国忘我地帮助我们的中国专家同志们。他们的名字和这一高尚的行为已经永远地刻在我们越南人的心里了。我们在这里又同样地看到你们的这一种崇高的国际主义精神。凭着比我们先走一步的经验，你们已经把你们在艰苦斗争中所吸取到的一切都传给我们了。我们将不会辜负你们对我们的希望的，相信我们吧！我们有我们敬爱的英明的领袖胡志明主席，有工人阶级先锋队——越南劳动党带路，有你们在旁边帮助鼓舞，我们是一定会胜利的！
    亲爱的中国朋友们！我们已经看到你们伟大的祖国了，我们像爱自己美丽的祖国一样地爱她；我们已经看到你们美丽的首都——北京了，我们像爱自己可爱的首都一样地爱她；我们已经看到你们，并且非常了解你们了，我们像爱自己兄弟姐妹一样地爱你们。中国、越南，北京、河内是永远连在一起的，中国人民和越南人民的心也是永远连在一起的。我们的友谊是永恒的，就像河里的水似地永年长流，而我们的奋斗目标——共产主义社会是一致的。让我们携起手来并肩前进吧！
