    中苏门答腊政变分子擅自设立占碑自治省
    据新华社雅加达9日电　割据中苏门答腊的“雄牛师委员会”在原来的占碑州成立了一个“自治省”。这个夺取了中苏门答腊省地方政权的组织的主席侯赛尼2月8日到占碑去主持了一个“占碑自治省”的成立典礼。
    据“永恒日报”今天说，“占碑自治省代理省长”也同时宣誓就职。报纸还说，第二军区（南苏门答腊）司令巴利安中校也派了代表参加那个典礼，并且致了贺词。
    印度尼西亚内政部长苏纳约2月7日曾经宣布，他不能批准“雄牛师委员会”给占碑省以自治省地位并且任命占碑州长为占碑省长这一行动。他指出，政府在向国会就苏门答腊问题的声明作一读答辩时已经提到，占碑问题将要和整个苏门答腊问题一起解决。
