Pepper is a tropical spice plant widely used as an antiseptic spice in the preserved food industry. It is also a valuable condiment. Pepper also has the effects of strengthening the stomach and promoting diuresis.

In the past, most of the pepper needed in our country was imported from abroad, and it was only after liberation that trial planting began on Hainan Island. The pepper introduced in Qiongdong County in 1951 can be considered the earliest.

The economic value of pepper is very high. Generally, it can be harvested two years after planting, and each plant can yield two to four pounds of white pepper per year. Based on planting one hundred and fifty plants per mu, more than three hundred pounds can be harvested, equivalent to about 3,300 yuan, which is equivalent to the value of 41,200 jin of rice. If it is well cultivated and managed, paying attention to thinning leaves, pruning vines, and applying fertilizer, it can be harvested continuously for fifteen to twenty years.

Pepper originally grows in humus soil in tropical forests, prefers warmth and humidity, and needs an environment without frost damage and with slight shade. Hainan Island is a suitable area for growing pepper; the Leizhou Peninsula, Guangxi, and southern parts of provinces such as Yunnan can also be tried, but protection must be taken in winter to protect it from frost damage.

There are mainly two varieties of pepper: one is the large-leaf pepper introduced from Hainan, which is characterized by rapid growth, and can flower and bear fruit one year after planting; the fruit spikes are up to ten centimeters long, and the fruits are large and mature uniformly. However, its drought resistance is poor, its lifespan is short, and it requires more fertile soil. The other is called small-leaf pepper, which has strong adaptability and drought resistance; the fruits are small, but the aroma is spicy; there are many inflorescences and the yield is high. The disadvantage is that the maturity period is very inconsistent. As long as flower thinning management can be strengthened, it also has cultivation value in our country. As for the white pepper and black pepper sold on the market, they are both produced by the same plant, but the processing methods are different: white pepper is made by soaking mature fruits in water, removing the peel, and then drying them; black pepper is made by drying fallen or slightly damaged immature fruits. White pepper is mostly used in medicine, and its selling price is higher than that of black pepper.

In the past, pepper was considered difficult to propagate by seeds. Recently, Zheng Hongshu, a returned overseas Chinese, used freshly picked pepper fruits as seeds and sowed them on "nutrient pots" made of burnt soil and compost, and the germination rate reached 80%. Now he is further studying how to promote early branching and fruiting of pepper in order to advance the harvest.

In the national plan for developing Hainan Island, it has been determined that after the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, the pepper planting area will be expanded more than three thousand five hundred times compared to the present. At that time, not only will the domestic demand for pepper be completely self-sufficient, but it can also be exported in large quantities. (Attached picture)

    胡椒——珍贵的热带香料作物
    麦少荣
    胡椒是一种热带出产的香辛植物，在腌渍食品工业中被当作防腐性的香料广泛使用。它又是名贵的调味品。胡椒还有健胃、利尿等作用。
    我国过去所需的胡椒大都是从国外输入的，解放后才在海南岛试种。1951年在琼东县引种的胡椒要算最早的。
    胡椒的经济价值都很高。一般种植二年以后可以收获，每株每年可收白胡椒两斤到四斤；每亩以种植一百五十株计算，可收三百斤以上，约合三千三百元，相当于四万一千二百斤稻谷的价值。如果培育管理得好，注意疏叶、剪蔓和施肥，可以连续收获十五年到二十年。
    胡椒原生长于热带森林中的腐植壤土上，性喜温热、湿润，需要没有霜害而有轻度树荫的环境。海南岛是适于种植胡椒的地区；雷州半岛、广西及云南等省的南部也可试种，但必须在冬季注意保护，使它不受霜害。
    胡椒主要有两个品种：一是海南引种的大叶胡椒，它的特点是生长快，植后一年就可以开花结果；果穗长达十公分，果实大而成熟期一致。但是它的耐旱性差，寿命短，而且需要较肥沃的土壤。另一种叫小叶胡椒，它的适应性强，耐旱瘠；果实小，但气味辛辣；花序多，产量高。缺点是成熟期很不一致。只要能加强疏花管理，它在我国也是有栽培价值的。至于市上出售的白胡椒和黑胡椒，都是由同一种植物所生的，只是加工方法不同：白胡椒是用成熟的果实浸渍水中，脱去果皮，然后晒干制成；黑胡椒是用脱落的或受轻伤的未成熟果实晒干制成的。医药上用的多是白胡椒，它的售价要比黑胡椒高一些。
    胡椒过去被人认为难以用种子繁殖。最近归国华侨郑宏书采用刚摘下的胡椒果作种，并播在用火烧土和堆肥混合制成的“营养盆”上，结果发芽率达到80％。现在他正在进一步研究如何促进胡椒早生枝结果，以提早收获。
    国家在开发海南岛的规划中确定，第二个五年计划实现后，胡椒种植面积将比现在扩大三千五百倍以上。那时候，不仅国内所需要的胡椒完全可以自给，还可以大量出口。（附图片）
