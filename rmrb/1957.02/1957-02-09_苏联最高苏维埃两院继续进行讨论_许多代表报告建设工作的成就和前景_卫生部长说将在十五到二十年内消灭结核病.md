Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 8th. Soviet Minister of Health, Kovrigina, stated at the meeting of the Nationalities Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the 7th that the Soviet Union would completely eliminate tuberculosis within the next fifteen to twenty years.

At the morning session of the Nationalities Council discussing the national economic plan and state budget, the Minister used a series of figures to illustrate the work done by the Soviet state for the health of all nationalities. Since the revolution, the mortality rate of Soviet residents has decreased by three-quarters, while it took the United States, France, and Britain about eighty-five years to reduce the mortality rate of residents by one-half. The Soviet Union has basically eliminated malaria. In 1934, there were more than nine million malaria patients in the country. In 1955, there were only 35,000. The incidence of tuberculosis in the Soviet Union is also decreasing year by year. From 1940 to the present, the tuberculosis mortality rate among urban residents has decreased by three-quarters, and among young people aged fifteen to nineteen, it has decreased by eleven-one hundredths.

Since the two houses of the Supreme Soviet began discussing the two drafts, approximately thirty people have spoken. They all supported the two drafts and offered some amendments to them. Like Representative Kovrigina, many people spoke about the achievements and prospects of their departments or regions.

At the evening session of the Union Council on the 7th, representatives from Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, and Dnepropetrovsk, the largest industrial centers, reported on the industrial development in their regions. Leningrad representative Smirnov said that in less than a year, Leningrad had produced nearly two hundred new machines and instruments. They decided to produce double the amount of new products under the same production conditions during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. From the speech of Ural representative Nikolaev, one is reminded of how the Soviet Union progressed from the backward years when it first began developing heavy industry to its current high level of industrialization. He mentioned that in 1921, the Soviet Union only smelted 116,000 tons of pig iron, while now, the blast furnaces of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine in the Urals can produce this much pig iron in a few days, or the entire national ferrous metallurgical industry can produce it in twenty-six hours.

Some representatives suggested expanding residential construction. The Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet, Bobrovnikov, said that construction workers in the capital decided to exceed the construction plan for 1.7 million square meters of housing this year and build an additional 100,000 square meters of housing. Now, the construction area in Moscow during the new Five-Year Plan has been expanded to more than 11 million square meters, which is equivalent to the total area of housing in Moscow before the revolution.

Gamash, a famous female tractor driver from Ryazan, announced that the agricultural laborers in her state decided to complete the Sixth Five-Year Plan's task of producing milk, meat, potatoes, and vegetables this year (three years ahead of schedule). She also mentioned that young people in the countryside no longer thought of going to the cities after graduating from school, as they did before the war. Now they all want to stay and work in the collective farms.

    苏联最高苏维埃两院继续进行讨论
    许多代表报告建设工作的成就和前景
    卫生部长说将在十五到二十年内消灭结核病
    新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联卫生部长科夫里金娜7日在苏联最高苏维埃民族院会议上发言说，苏联要在最近十五到二十年的时间内完全消灭结核病。
    在这天上午民族院讨论国民经济计划和国家预算的会议上，这位部长用一系列的数字说明苏维埃国家为各族人民健康所做的工作。从革命以来，苏联居民死亡率已经降低了四分之三，而美国、法国和英国大约花了八十五年的时间才使居民死亡率降低了二分之一。苏联已经基本上消灭了疟疾。1934年全国有九百多万疟疾病患者。而1955年只有三万五千人了。苏联结核病患病率也在逐年降低。从1940年到现在，城市居民的结核病死亡率降低了四分之三，而在十五岁到十九岁的青年中已经降低十一分之一。
    最高苏维埃两院开始讨论两个草案以来，约有三十人发了言。他们全都支持这两项草案，并且对它们提出了一些修正意见。而许多人都像科夫里金娜代表一样，在发言中谈到了他的部门或地区的工作成就和前景。
    在7日晚间的联盟院会议上，来自列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克和第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克几个最大的工业中心的代表，报告了他们那里工业发展的情况。列宁格勒代表斯米尔诺夫说，在过去不到一年的时间内，列宁格勒已经出产了近二百种新的机器和仪器。他们决定在第六个五年计划内以同样的生产条件出产双倍的新产品。从乌拉尔代表尼古拉耶夫的发言中，令人想起苏联如何从刚开始发展重工业的时候的落后年代，进到现在的高度工业水平。他谈到，1921年，苏联只熔炼了十一万六千吨的生铁，而现在，由乌拉尔一个马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合厂的高炉工作几天，或者由全国黑色冶金工业工作二十六小时就能炼出这么多生铁了。
    有一些代表提出要求扩大住宅建筑的建议。莫斯科市苏维埃主席波布罗夫尼科夫说，首都的建筑工人决定今年超额完成一百七十万平方公尺房屋的建筑计划，多建筑十万平方公尺的房屋。现在，新五年计划中莫斯科的建筑面积已经扩大到一千一百多万平方公尺，这等于莫斯科革命以前住房的总面积。
    梁赞来的著名女拖拉机手加马什宣布，她的州里的农业劳动者决定在今年（即提前三年）完成第六个五年计划生产牛奶、肉类、马铃薯和蔬菜的任务。她还谈到，那里乡村里的青年已经不再像战前一样，从学校毕业后总想到城市里去，现在他们都要留在集体农庄工作了。
