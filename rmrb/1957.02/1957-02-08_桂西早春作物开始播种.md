Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th. Amidst spring thunder and welcome rain, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture have begun sowing early spring crops. Of the more than two million mu of early-maturing crops planned for the entire prefecture, such as early corn and spring buckwheat, over 300,000 mu have already been sown.

Jingxi and Ningming counties, which are close to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, started spring planting earliest. Members of the Luoguo Agricultural Cooperative in Jingxi County were busy sowing early corn in single-season paddy fields in mid-January. After the start of spring planting, the leading organs of Ningming County emphasized that leading cadres should go to the countryside, and county and district cadres have successively gone deep into the production teams of agricultural cooperatives to arrange production together with the members. Before the Spring Festival, this county had accumulated nearly one million dan of farm manure, with an average of twenty-two dan of fertilizer applied per mu of spring crops.

In Yongning and Yishan areas, which suffered from severe drought last year, many agricultural cooperatives have launched a surge of rushing to plant early-maturing crops in order to increase grain production and tide over the grain shortage season in late spring and early summer. In Laibin, Liujiang and other four counties, more than 60,000 mu of corn, buckwheat, and millet were planted in a few days, and 300,000 mu of land was plowed.

In the course of sowing early spring crops, the agricultural cooperatives continued to promote advanced techniques suitable to local conditions, and steadily improved some backward farming methods. Most agricultural cooperatives in Baise, Debao and other counties, as in the past year, insisted on changing the habit of not applying fertilizer. Xincheng County trained a large number of agricultural cooperative technicians to promote various necessary technical reforms.

    桂西早春作物开始播种
    新华社南宁6日电　在春雷喜雨中，桂西僮族自治州各族农民开始播种早春作物。全州计划种植的两百多万亩早玉米、春荞麦等早熟作物，现在已经种下三十多万亩。
    接近越南民主共和国的靖西、宁明等县，春种开始得最早。靖西县罗果农业社的社员们，1月中旬就忙碌地在单季稻田里播种早玉米。宁明县领导机关在春种开始后，强调领导干部下乡，县、区干部已经先后深入到农业社的生产队里，和社员共同安排生产。这个县在春节前已经积得农家肥料近百万担，平均每亩春种作物能施肥料二十二担。
    去年受旱比较严重的邕宁和宜山地区，许多农业社为了增产更多的粮食，度过春末夏初缺粮季节，抢种早熟作物已经形成热潮。来宾、柳江等四个县，几天内就抢种玉米、荞麦、小米六万多亩，犁田三十万亩。
    在播种早春作物当中，各农业社继续推行了一些切合当地条件的先进技术，并且稳步地改进了某些落后的耕作方法。百色、德保等县大部分农业社和去年一样，坚持改变不施肥料的习惯。忻城县训练了大批的农业社技术员，推行各项必要的技术改革。
