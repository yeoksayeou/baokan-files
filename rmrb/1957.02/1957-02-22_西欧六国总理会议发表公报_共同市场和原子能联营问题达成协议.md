Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 21st: The prime ministers of France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg held a conference in Paris from February 19th to 20th to discuss the establishment of a "Common Market" and an "Atomic Energy Joint Organization," and issued a communiqué after the meeting regarding the results of the discussions.

It is understood that the issues before this conference were the linking of the European "Common Market" with the territories in Africa belonging to France, Belgium, and others, and the issue of ownership of fissionable materials.

Regarding the overseas territories issue, the communiqué stated that the six countries agreed to include in the "Common Market" treaty the principle expressing their willingness to incorporate territories linked to them into the "Common Market," and the principle of contributing to the economic and social investments needed to develop these territories. As an appendix to the treaty, they will also conclude an initial agreement for a period of five years, "defining the scope of application of these principles" and stipulating the conditions under which member states and overseas territories will gradually open up to mutual trade.

According to a French spokesperson, the six countries' investments in the first five years, including France's $200 million, amount to $581.125 million, of which approximately 80% will be allocated to French territories in West and Equatorial Africa. He also said that this joint investment fund will be specifically applied to French West Africa and Equatorial Africa. The investment fund will also be used to fund the development of Algeria, but how to apply the terms of the Common Market to this region, as well as Madagascar and other places, will be decided by the Common Market Council of Ministers by unanimous vote after the first two years. Because these regions are economically underdeveloped, future industries there "may need some protection in the early stages."

Regarding the issue of ownership of fissionable materials, the communiqué stated that the conference agreed that the "European Atomic Energy Joint Organization" will own the "special" fissionable materials. According to Agence France-Presse, West Germany made concessions to France in this regard. At the same time, France and other countries also agreed that each country "retains considerable rights of use within the scope of the joint venture."

    西欧六国总理会议发表公报
    共同市场和原子能联营问题达成协议
    据新华社21日讯　巴黎消息：法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡六国总理19日到20日在巴黎举行会议，讨论建立“共同市场”和“原子能联营组织”问题，并且在会后就讨论结果发表了公报。
    据悉：摆在这次会议面前的，是把欧洲“共同市场”同法国、比利时等在非洲的属地联系起来的问题和对裂变物质的所有权问题。
    关于海外属地的问题，据会议公报说，六国同意在“共同市场”条约中包括表示六国愿意把同它们有联系的领地并入“共同市场”的原则，并且包括愿意为开发这些领地所需要的经济和社会投资“贡献力量”的原则。作为条约的附件，它们还要缔结一项为期五年的第一个协定，“确定这些原则的应用范围”，规定成员国和海外领地逐步对互相的贸易开放的条件。
    据法国发言人说，六国在第一个五年中的投资，包括法国的二亿美元在内，是五亿八千一百二十五万美元，其中大约80％将拨给非洲的法国领地。他还说，这笔联合投资资金将特别应用于法属西非和赤道非洲。投资基金也将用来资助阿尔及利亚的发展，但是如何对这个地区以及马达加斯加等地运用共同市场的条款，还要在开头两年后再由共同市场部长理事会以一致票决定。因为这些地区经济不发达，那里将来的工业“可能在初期需要某种保护”。
    关于对裂变物质的所有权问题，公报说，会议同意“欧洲原子能联营组织”将拥有对“特别”的裂变物质的所有权。据法新社说，在这方面，西德是向法国让了步。但同时，法国及其他国家也同意每个国家在“联营范围内保留很大的使用权”。
