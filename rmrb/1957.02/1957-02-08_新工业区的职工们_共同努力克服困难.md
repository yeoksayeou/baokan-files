    In the past few years, a number of new industrial areas have emerged on the motherland's fields. The magnificent construction scenes of these new industrial areas greatly inspire people. The vast number of workers working in these places are highly enthusiastic about their work. However, in many new industrial areas, the facilities serving the workers' lives cannot keep up with the needs, and the workers feel many difficulties in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation.
    How should we view these difficulties in the lives of workers in new industrial areas?
    Generally speaking, the difficulties in the lives of workers in new industrial areas are some temporary difficulties brought about by the characteristics of the new industrial areas themselves. New industrial areas were originally generally wilderness or rural areas, and various living service facilities were very lacking. When a large number of workers and their families arrived, they brought various problems in life. Due to limitations in funds, materials, and transportation, the state cannot build all living service facilities at once, but can only first solve the most pressing living problems and then gradually improve them. Under such circumstances, it is an unavoidable phenomenon that new industrial areas will have some inconveniences in life for a certain period of time. This requires the worker comrades in the new industrial areas to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and strive to overcome these difficulties.
    At present, many builders of new industrial areas are willing to endure the various inconveniences in life and are actively working for the future of the new industrial areas with great enthusiasm. However, there are also a few workers, especially some workers who have lived in big cities for a long time, who still regard the living problems in the new industrial areas almost entirely according to their original living standards, and thus put forward some demands that are too high and cannot be realized in the short term.
    We should see that some of the living difficulties in new industrial areas are also common in many old cities. This is because my country's original economy was very backward. Although all aspects of production have greatly developed since liberation, many aspects still cannot keep up with the growth of people's living needs. For example, taking the problem of public transportation, many old cities, like new industrial areas, have the phenomenon of traffic congestion. The worker comrades in the new industrial areas should understand this situation, and should not be dissatisfied or angry because of this, and even take incorrect and non-comradely attitudes towards the staff of the bus company.
    In some new industrial areas, there are more difficulties in the lives of workers, which are related to shortcomings in the work of relevant departments. For example, when arranging industrial construction projects in some new industrial areas, the relevant departments did not pay attention to simultaneously building an appropriate number of dormitories, public utilities, and public service institutions. Also, some new industrial areas lack accurate planning by the construction units, the number of workers absorbed greatly exceeds the quota, the administrative management institutions are too large, the production workers are concentrated too early and too much, and the family members of the workers flock in large numbers shortly after the start of the project, resulting in a rapid increase in the population. Although the state has built a large number of houses and public service facilities, it still cannot keep up with the needs. These shortcomings could have been avoided. The reason why they were not avoided is mainly due to lack of experience. The relevant competent departments are studying ways to actively solve the existing problems.
    However, it should be pointed out that even after the relevant departments have overcome the shortcomings in their work, many living difficulties in new industrial areas are still difficult to solve for a while. Under the current specific economic conditions in our country, the difficult problems in people's lives can only be solved gradually. We hope that the worker comrades participating in the construction of the new industrial areas can recognize their glorious and arduous mission and do their best to assist the government in overcoming certain difficulties. For example, because some new industrial areas have just started construction and the dormitories have not yet been completed, the houses are relatively crowded, and the worker comrades should not bring their families over too early. Workers in some areas voluntarily participate in voluntary labor in their spare time to build roads and houses. This can save the state money and improve their lives faster.
    The important responsibility of the relevant departments and leaders of factories and mines in the new industrial areas is to truthfully explain the current local situation and difficulties to the workers. All workers should be told sincerely what difficulties cannot be avoided for a while and require the joint efforts of the workers to overcome, and what difficulties can be solved and how they are being solved now. In the Jianxi New Industrial Area of Luoyang City, because the basic construction workers have not yet left, and the production workers have arrived one after another, the housing is very crowded, and the workers have many opinions. Recently, several factories held worker representative meetings, at which the construction and distribution of houses were explained. After such an explanation, many workers said that they could overcome the current difficulties, and some workers also suggested that they would not move their families here for the time being to avoid increasing the crowding of the houses. This fact proves the importance of persuasion and explanation. After the worker comrades understand the actual situation, they will be able to work together with the leadership to overcome difficulties.

### 新工业区的职工们  共同努力克服困难

    新工业区的职工们  共同努力克服困难
    这几年，在祖国的原野上，出现了一批新的工业区。这些新工业区的宏伟的建设景象，给人们以很大的鼓舞。在这些地方工作的广大职工，工作热情很高。但是，许多新工业区由于为职工生活服务的设施赶不上需要，职工们在衣、食、住、行等方面感到不少的困难。
    对于新工业区职工生活方面的这种困难，应该怎样看待呢？
    一般说来，新工业区职工生活方面的困难，是新工业区本身的特点带来的一些暂时的困难。新工业区原来一般都是荒野或者农村，各种生活服务设施都很缺乏，当大批职工和他们的家属到来的时候，就带来了生活上的各种问题。由于资金、材料、交通等方面的限制，国家不可能一下子建设起全部生活服务设施，只能首先解决最迫切的生活问题，然后逐步加以改善。在这样的情况下，新工业区在一定时期内，生活上有某些不方便，是不可避免的现象。这就需要新工业区的职工同志们发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，努力克服这些困难。
    目前，许多新工业区的建设者们，都甘愿忍受生活上的种种不便，满怀热情地为新工业区的将来而积极劳动着。可是，也有少数职工，特别是一部分原来在大城市生活较久的职工，现在还几乎完全按照原来的生活水平来看待新工业区的生活问题，因而提出了一些过高的、短期内无法实现的要求。
    我们应该看到，新工业区有一些生活上的困难，是许多老城市也同样有的。这是因为我国原来的经济十分落后，解放以后各项生产虽然都有很大发展，但是许多方面仍然赶不上人民生活需要的增长。譬如拿公共交通问题来说，许多老城市就同新工业区一样，存在着交通拥挤的现象。新工业区的职工同志们应该谅解这种情况，不要因此就不满和气愤，甚至对公共汽车公司工作人员采取不正确的、非同志的态度。
    有的新工业区职工生活方面的困难比较多，跟有关部门工作中的缺点有关。例如，有的新工业区在安排工业建设项目的时候，有关部门没有注意同时建设适当数量的宿舍、公用事业和公共服务机构。也有的新工业区因为建设单位缺乏准确的计划，吸收工人的数量大大超过定额，行政管理机构过于庞大，生产工人集中得过早过多，职工家属在工程开始建设不久就大量涌来，结果人口增加过快，国家虽然修建大批住宅和公共服务设施，仍然赶不上需要。这些缺点本来是可以避免的。其所以没有避免，主要地是由于缺乏经验。对于已经存在的问题，有关的主管部门正在研究办法，准备积极加以解决。
    但是应该指出，就在有关部门克服了自己工作中的缺点以后，新工业区有许多生活方面的困难仍然是一时难以解决的。在目前我国的具体经济条件下，人民生活中的困难问题只能逐步解决。我们希望，参加新工业区建设的职工同志们，能够认清自己光荣而艰巨的使命，尽力协助政府克服某些困难。例如，有的新工业区因为刚开始建设不久，宿舍还没有盖完，房屋比较拥挤，职工同志们就不要过早地把家属接去。有些地区的职工在业余时间自动参加义务劳动，修建道路和住宅。这样既可以为国家节约资金，又可以更快地改善自己的生活。
    新工业区的有关部门和厂矿企业的领导人员的重大责任，是要把当时当地的情况和困难如实地向职工讲清楚。应该诚恳地告诉全体职工，哪些是一时无法避免的困难，需要职工共同努力克服；哪些是可能解决的，现在正在如何解决。在洛阳市涧西新工业区，由于基本建设工人还没有走，生产工人又陆续到来，使得住房十分拥挤，职工们有不少意见。最近几个工厂召开职工代表会议，在会上说明了房屋的建设和分配等情况。经过这样的说明，许多职工都表示能够克服当前的困难，有些职工还提出目前不把家属搬来，以免增加房屋的拥挤程度。这个事实证明了说服解释工作的重要性。职工同志们在了解了实际情况以后，就能够跟领导方面同心协力，克服困难。
