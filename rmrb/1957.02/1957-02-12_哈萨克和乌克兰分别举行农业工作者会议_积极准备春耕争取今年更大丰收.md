    Kazakhstan and Ukraine Hold Agricultural Workers Conferences
    Actively Preparing for Spring Planting to Strive for an Even Greater Harvest This Year
    (Our Moscow Dispatch, February 11th) Reporter Li He reports: In the southern Soviet Union, the sounds of approaching spring can already be heard. Currently, Soviet agricultural workers are actively preparing for spring planting, striving for an even greater harvest this year than last.
    At the agricultural workers conference in the Kazakh Republic, people full of confidence decided that this year they must achieve good harvests of all crops, that the republic's total grain output should reach 1.5 billion poods, and that animal husbandry should see tremendous development. A competition to prepare well for spring planting has unfolded across the republic. Most of the oblasts and districts have prepared for spring planting better than last year. State farms and collective farms have adequate seeds, machines are being repaired more quickly, and snow has accumulated on millions of hectares of land. There is a gratifying amount of snow. People in the new lands have also formulated plans for supplementary land reclamation. This year, the Yesil District of Akmolinsk Oblast will reclaim an additional 25,000 to 30,000 hectares of new land. Several collective farms served by the Molotov Machine Tractor Station in Kokchetav Oblast, which have reclaimed tens of thousands of hectares of new land in the past, will reclaim an additional 13,000 hectares this year.
    To welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, agricultural workers in the Ukrainian Republic have launched a competition to increase production in all sectors of agriculture. At the republic's agricultural workers conference, various oblasts put forward their goals for this year's struggle. All localities are preparing seeds for spring crops and repairing agricultural machinery and tools.
