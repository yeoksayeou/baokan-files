Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd. On January 30th, after a spell of rain and snow, Nanjing was clearing up, and the lights of the railway ferry terminals on both sides of the Yangtze River shone brightly. All kinds of trains rumbled back and forth, and the whistles of the trains and ferries cut through the river and echoed across the night sky. This is the Nanjing Railway Ferry, the throat connecting north and south of the motherland. While people were celebrating the Spring Festival, the workers of the Nanjing Ferry were working hard.

On this day, the ferry workers had an early Spring Festival dinner with their families at 5:00 PM and rushed to the ferry terminal from all directions to prepare for their shift. Their work hours were scheduled to begin at 7:30 PM, but they all arrived an hour and a half early to make the preparations even more meticulous. More than 80 people were on duty that night, including Wang Baogui, the captain of the "Pukou" ferry, who had attended the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference. The director of the ferry and the Communist Party branch secretaries of the main working departments also participated in the night shift. All the staff actively carried out their work in order to complete the heavy transportation tasks. The engine room mechanics of the "Pukou" ferry closely watched every movement of the machinery, manipulating the machines with rhythmic movements. The stokers evenly added coal, ensuring the required air pressure for the machinery. The personnel in the pilot house, like the eyes and brain of the ship, directed the ferry's progress. Wang Baogui, the captain of the "Pukou" ferry on duty, skillfully directed the work of the entire ship. In the past, he had personally piloted the ship in situations of strong winds and waves, and he did so again on this festive night. From August 1952 to the present, Wang Baogui has had four and a half years of safe, accident-free service.

On this night, thirty trains passed back and forth within twelve hours. Among them were eight passenger trains fully loaded with passengers from all over the country. Some were workers participating in the construction of the Northwest returning to Shanghai and other places to visit relatives, and others were traveling from Shanghai and other places to Beijing. There were also twenty freight trains carrying various industrial construction materials, industrial products, and non-staple foods, which were transported from here to all parts of the country.

As the sun rose and firecrackers echoed on both sides of the Yangtze River, the day shift workers came to take over. The workers who had worked hard all night completed the tasks assigned to them by the motherland and happily went home to celebrate the Spring Festival with their families.

    长江夜渡
    新华社南京2日电　1月30日，南京雨雪初晴，长江两岸火车轮渡码头灯火辉煌，各式列车轰隆隆地往来奔驰，火车和轮渡的气笛声划过江水，响彻夜空。这里就是贯通祖国南北交通的咽喉——南京火车轮渡，当人们正在欢度春节的时候，南京轮渡的职工们正在紧张地工作。
    这天，轮渡所的职工们，提前在下午五点和亲人们一起吃了迎春晚饭，即从四面八方赶到轮渡所准备接班。他们上班工作的时间，是下午七点半，而他们早一个半小时就都到齐了，把准备工作做得更加仔细。这晚值班的有参加过全国先进生产者代表会议的浦口号渡轮值班船长王宝贵等八十多人，轮渡所所长和主要工作部门的中共支部书记这天也都参加了夜班工作。全体职工为了完成繁重的运输任务，都积极地进行工作。浦口号渡轮机舱轮机员密切注视着机器的每一个动作，操纵着机器有节奏的运动，司炉人员在均衡地添着煤，保证了机器所需要的气压，驾驶室的人员像船上的眼睛和大脑，指挥渡轮的前进。浦口号值班船长王宝贵熟练地指挥着全船的工作，过去凡遇大风大浪的情况，他都亲自驾驶，在这个节日的夜晚，他也亲自驾驶。从1952年8月起到现在，王宝贵已经四年半安全无事故。
    这天晚上的十二个小时内，从这里往返渡过了三十列火车。其中有八列客车满载着来自各地的旅客，有的是参加西北建设的职工们回上海等地探亲，有的是从上海等地去北京。还有二十列货车载运着各种工业建设材料，工业产品和副食品，从这里运向祖国各地。
    当旭日东升，长江两岸不断发出爆竹声的时候，日班工人已经来接班工作。辛勤工作了一夜的职工完成了祖国交给他们的任务，愉快地回家和亲人欢度春节去了。
