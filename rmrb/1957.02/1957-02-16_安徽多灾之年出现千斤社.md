Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 13th: In 1956, a year of multiple disasters, five "Thousand-Jin Cooperatives" emerged in the mountainous, hilly, and polder areas between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in Anhui Province. Their average yield increased by about 50% compared to the bumper year of 1955.

    These five "Thousand-Jin Cooperatives" are the Tuanjie (Unity) Cooperative in Yuexi County, the Linjian and Zhongxin (Center) Cooperatives in Qianshan County, the Tiechi (Iron Ruler) Cooperative in Susong County, and the Gongyuan (Park) Cooperative in Tongcheng County. These five cooperatives have a total of 3,100 mu of cultivated land, and the average yield per mu in each cooperative exceeded 1,000 jin, with the highest being 1,040 jin and the lowest being 1,001 jin.

    The common characteristic of these five Thousand-Jin Cooperatives is that they fully utilized the superior conditions of collectivization and actively promoted agricultural production reforms in accordance with local conditions. The Tuanjie Cooperative in Yuexi County is located in the Dabie Mountains, and crops are affected by the harsh mountain climate. However, they started by expanding the planting area of mid-season crops to increase the multiple cropping index, enabling the entire cooperative's 141 mu of land to achieve an average yield of 1,001 jin per mu. All 809 mu of cultivated land of the Zhongxin Cooperative in Qianshan County are located on undulating hills, making it the cooperative with the poorest soil quality among the 14 agricultural cooperatives in the township. However, due to their active efforts in water conservancy and soil improvement, as well as increased multiple cropping area, the yield per mu increased to 1,039 jin and 14 liang. The Gongyuan Cooperative in Tongcheng County is located in a polder area surrounded by water on three sides. Each person in the cooperative has an average of only 1.07 mu of land, and in the past, the yield was at most 600 jin per mu, making life very difficult for the farmers. Last year, an advanced cooperative was established, and double-cropping rice was promoted on a large scale, with a total of 756 mu planted, and the yield per mu also reached over 1,000 jin.

    The increased production facts of these five "Thousand-Jin Cooperatives" have greatly encouraged the surrounding agricultural cooperatives' confidence in promoting agricultural production reforms. Near the Tuanjie Cooperative in Yuexi County, the Shizui and Xihe Cooperatives have already learned from the experience of the Tuanjie Cooperative and have formulated plans to strive to become Thousand-Jin Cooperatives in 1957.

### 安徽多灾之年出现千斤社

    安徽多灾之年出现千斤社
    新华社合肥13日电　安徽省江淮之间的山区、丘陵区和圩区，在多灾的1956年出现了五个“千斤社”。它们的平均产量都比丰收的1955年增产五成左右。
    这五个“千斤社”是岳西县的团结社，潜山县的林建社和中心社，宿松县的铁尺社，桐城县的公园社。这五个社共有耕地三千一百亩，每社每亩平均产量都超过千斤，最高的是一千零四十斤，最低的是一千零一斤。
    这五个千斤社的共同特点是充分利用合作化的优越条件，积极的因地制宜地推行了农业生产改革。岳西县团结社，地处大别山区，农作物受到山区恶劣气候的影响，但他们从扩大午季作物播种面积增加复种指数着手，使全社一百四十一亩土地获得平均每亩一千零一斤的收成。潜山县中心社八百零九亩耕地全在起伏不平的山岗上，是全乡十四个农业社中土质最差的一个，但由于他们积极兴修水利和改良土壤，并且增加了复种面积，使每亩产量提高到一千零三十九斤十四两。桐城县公园社处在三面有水的圩区，全社每人平均只有一亩零七厘地，过去每亩最多收六百斤，农民生活很苦，去年办了高级社，大面积推广了双季稻，共栽七百五十六亩，每亩产量也达到一千斤以上。
    这五个“千斤社”的增产事实，大大鼓舞了周围农业社推行农业生产改革的信心。岳西县团结社附近，已有石咀、溪河两个社学习了团结社的经验，制定了争取在1957年成为千斤社的计划。
