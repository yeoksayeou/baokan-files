    Letter of Correction
    The news I wrote about "A 1200-jin Big White Pig" (see page 3 of this newspaper, December 25th last year) is untrue. As early as November 26th last year, when the Taiyuan City Food Company and Taiyuan City People's Park came to Xugou Town to transfer pigs, it was decided to weigh them. However, because the Big White Pig broke the door panel and was frightened and ran away, the weighing did not happen. Later, the "soft ruler pig measuring method" introduced in the "Food Work Communication" was used for calculation. At that time, this Big White Pig was six chi two cun long, its chest circumference was eight chi five cun, and its height was three chi six cun. According to this calculation, the weight of the pig was about 1200 jin. In addition, I was doing leadership work and did not understand the technology, and the technicians of our company all said in unison "it is more than 1200 jin", so I wrote "1200 jin" in the report. After this pig was transported to Taiyuan, the first weighing was 679 jin; after more than 20 days, it was weighed again, and it was 635 jin. Now it seems that it is definitely not 1200 jin. But it is also not just "679 jin" or "635 jin". Because transporting it from Xugou Town to Taiyuan will cause it to lose fat, and the pig caught fire and did not eat anything, and the park did not raise it well, etc., it is estimated that it lost more than 100 jin. The original weight of this pig is estimated to be between 750 jin and 800 jin.　Guo Zhaojing

    来函更正
    我写的“一千二百斤重的一头大白猪”消息（见本报去年12月25日第三版），是不真实的。远在去年11月26日太原市食品公司和太原市人民公园来徐沟镇调猪的时候，曾经决定过磅。但由于大白猪把门板压断，并受惊跑掉，没有过成磅。后来，就根据“食品工作通讯”上介绍的“软尺量猪法”计算。当时，这头大白猪身长六尺二寸，胸围是八尺五寸，身高三尺六寸。这样计算下来，猪的重量为一千二百斤左右。加以我是作领导工作的，不懂得技术，而我们公司的技术人员又异口同声地说“足有一千二百斤左右”，所以我在报道中就写成“一千二百斤”。这头猪被运到太原后，第一次过磅是六百七十九斤；过了二十多天后又过了一次磅，是六百三十五斤。现在来看，不够一千二百斤是肯定的。但也不只“六百七十九斤”或“六百三十五斤”。因为由徐沟镇运往太原，是要脱膘的，加以猪起火，不吃东西，公园又饲养不善等等，估计脱膘在一百斤以上。这头猪原来的重量，估计在七百五十斤到八百斤之间。　郭兆敬
