    School Life During the Spring Festival	Luo Li
    The Spring Festival has brought new and joyful content to the lives of teachers and students in schools. On the morning of the Spring Festival, students staying on campus at all departments of the Renmin University of China were busy visiting their teachers' homes to offer Spring Festival greetings. Although Professor Xu Mengxiong, director of the Foreign Language Teaching and Research Office of the Journalism Department, and his wife were not at home, two female students specifically went to the old professor's home to offer their regards, thinking of their children during the festival. Students offering Spring Festival greetings to teachers is not merely a customary etiquette; more importantly, it is to thank the teachers for their hard work day and night throughout the year to improve the quality of teaching, helping students to rapidly improve their academic performance (the average grade of fourth-year students in the Economics Department in the term exam was above 4.57). The relationship between teachers and students is becoming increasingly close in the joint completion of teaching tasks.
    The Spring Festival activities further strengthened the ties between teachers and students, which is very helpful for doing a good job in teaching. The Teaching and Research Office of Chinese Revolutionary History and the Revolutionary History major class of the History Department held a Spring Festival get-together on the 29th. At the meeting, everyone was particularly interested in listening to Comrade Hu Hua, director of the Teaching and Research Office, talk about the work of the Teaching and Research Office in the past year, as well as the main tasks to be completed this year, so that students knew that teachers had spent a lot of hard work to do a good job in teaching. When the students learned that the Teaching and Research Office had a considerable amount of data stored, that more than 200,000 words of lecture notes would be published soon, and that more than 60 historical maps had been drawn, the students' confidence in learning was further increased. Comrade Hu Baijun said: "We used to worry about not learning the major well, but it seems that our concerns were unnecessary. The Teaching and Research Office has prepared all the necessary conditions for our study. In the future, it mainly depends on our own efforts." Comrade Gong Yongkang, the secretary of the Party branch of the Teaching and Research Office of Chinese Revolutionary History, also introduced the expertise and hobbies of each teacher present to the students, so that the students had a new understanding of the teachers.
    At the get-together, teachers and students jointly performed programs, among which Comrade Hu Hua's telling of the stories of the revolutionary martyrs was particularly noteworthy. The students were deeply moved by every plot of the story.
    On this day, Comrade Peng Ming, deputy director of the Teaching and Research Office, and other teachers also went to each student's dormitory to inquire about the students' living conditions with great concern.
    The Spring Festival has brought us new and joyful lives. Everyone felt that the get-together was fruitful, especially meaningful for enhancing friendship between teachers and students. The Philosophy Department is also preparing to hold such a Spring Festival get-together for teachers and students.

    春节中的学校生活	罗丽
    春节，给我们在学校生活的老师和同学，带来了新的欢乐的内容。中国人民大学各系留校同学，在春节早上，都忙着到老师家里去祝贺春节。新闻系外国语教研室主任许孟雄教授夫妇虽然都不在家，为了惦念他们的孩子过节，两位女同学还特意去老教授家问候。同学们向老师祝贺春节，这不只是寻常的礼节，更重要的，是感谢一年来老师们为了提高教学质量，日夜辛勤劳动，帮助同学们使他们的学习成绩得到迅速提高（经济系四年级期考平均成绩在四·五七分以上），师生之间就是在共同完成教学任务中，感情因而日益密切起来的。
    通过春节活动，进一步加强了师生联系，对搞好教学工作很有帮助。中国革命史教研室和历史系革命史专业班于二十九日召开了师生联欢会。会上，大家特别有兴趣地听了教研室主任胡华同志谈到教研室去年一年的工作情况，以及今年将要完成的几件主要工作，使同学们知道老师们为了搞好教学工作花费了许多艰苦的劳动。当同学们听说教研室存有的资料相当丰富，不久二十多万字的讲义将出版，六十多幅历史性地图已绘成等情况，更加增加了同学们的学习信心。胡百钧同学说：“我们以前担心专业学不好，看来是多余的顾虑，教研室为我们学习准备了一切必要的条件，今后主要看我们自己的努力了。”中国革命史教研室党支部书记宫永康同志，还把到会的全体老师每个人的擅长、喜好，向同学们作了介绍，使同学们对老师增加了新的了解。
    联欢会上，还由老师、同学共同表演了节目，其中引人注意的是胡华同志给大家讲的革命先烈的斗争故事。同学们都深深地为故事的每个情节所感动。
    这天，教研室副主任彭明同志和其他教员还到每个同学的宿舍中去，很关心地询问了同学们的生活情况。
    春节给我们带来了新的欢乐生活。大家觉得联欢会收获不少，特别是对增进师生友谊很有意义。哲学系也准备在春节中召开这样的师生联欢会。
