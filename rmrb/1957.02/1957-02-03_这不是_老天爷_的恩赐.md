This is not a Gift from "Heaven"
Wu Jinlie, Deputy Director of the Kengbian Branch of the Tangjia Agricultural Cooperative in Wannian County, Jiangxi Province.

In 1956, our cooperative had a bumper harvest unprecedented in decades, yielding more than 280,000 jin more grain than in 1955, an increase of 46%. 91.1% of the cooperative members increased their income.

I remember that during the land reform, out of the 468 households in Kengbian, 295 were poor and landless peasants. After several years of effort, the number of poor and landless peasants had decreased by 73 households. However, the bumper harvest of last year alone raised the living standards of 144 poor peasant members to the level of middle peasants. How could such a big change not be exciting?

Some people say that last year's bumper harvest was due to "good weather." In fact, we also suffered from drought last year. The bumper harvest was not a gift from heaven, but was brought about by the advanced cooperative.

Originally, drought and insect pests posed a great threat to our area, damaging thousands and thousands of jin of grain almost every year. The year before last, we investigated and found that an average of seven or eight rice stalks were killed by insect bites. At that time, some people's fear of drought and insect pests could not be completely eliminated. They still pinned their hopes on "heaven" according to old habits. When there was a drought, they hoped for rain; when insect pests were rampant, they hoped that the west wind would rise and "collect" the pests.

After the establishment of the advanced cooperative, we realized our own strength. As some young cooperative members said, "We must take increasing production into our own hands." The sixty-odd mu of land on Zhengban used to dry up and wither whenever it was sunny for a few days in a row after the fifth lunar month. The year before last, we planted a season of early rice and used five waterwheels to pump water continuously to fight the drought, but more than forty mu still dried up. Last year, with the advanced cooperative, we had made preparations early and dug a large ditch more than one zhang deep and half a li long with more than two hundred people. The sixty-odd mu of land on Zhengban was not only no longer afraid of drought, but also planted with double-cropping rice. The yield per mu increased from about one hundred jin to eight hundred and forty jin.

We had also made early preparations for drought prevention in ordinary paddy fields. In the past, water conservancy was privately owned, and there were "four prohibitions" on water use during droughts. Some ponds had plenty of water, but others were not allowed to pump water from them. These regulations forced some farmers to put down their work and argue over water at critical moments of drought resistance; of course, it also greatly hindered the full发挥fāhuī (to bring into play) of the effectiveness of water conservancy equipment. With the realization of advanced cooperation, ponds and dams were incorporated into the cooperative, and we rationally adjusted all water conservancy equipment and re-stipulated the irrigation range of each pond and dam, so the effectiveness of water conservancy equipment was multiplied. The sixty-three ponds of the two production teams in Zhoujiatang used to irrigate only seventy mu of land, but last year they irrigated one hundred and sixty-two mu. In this way, during critical moments of drought resistance, we were able to concentrate our efforts on fields without water conservancy equipment. Last summer, there was no rain for dozens of days in a row, and more than two hundred mu of fields without water conservancy equipment suffered from drought. We quickly concentrated more than eighty laborers and forty waterwheels, and used the method of "wheel接车jiēchē (connecting the wheels), day连夜liányè (day and night)" to divert water from the other side of the mountain to this side, and finally overcame the drought. Last year, we had no insect pests here. The winter before last, when the advanced cooperative had just been established, we braved the severe cold and devoted ourselves to winter ploughing and pest control. The field ridges were cleared of grass, the rice stalks were pulled out, and the cloddy fields were turned over. The parents of the insects were eliminated in winter, and of course they had no descendants to harm us again.

### 这不是“老天爷”的恩赐

    这不是“老天爷”的恩赐
    江西万年县唐家农业社坑边分社副主任　吴金栎
    1956年，我们社里得到了几十年来没有过的大丰收，比1955年多收了二十八万多斤谷子，增产46％。91.1％的社员都增加了收入。
    我记得，在土地改革的时候，我们坑边这个地方四百六十八户人家，就有二百九十五户贫雇农。经过几年的努力，贫雇农算是减少了七十三户。可是，只去年一年的大丰收，一下子就有一百四十四户贫农社员的生活提高到了中农水平。这样的大变化，怎能叫人不兴奋呢？
    有人说：去年大丰收是因为“天年好”。其实我们这里去年也受旱了，大丰收并不是老天的恩赐，是高级合作化带来的。
    原来，干旱、虫灾对我们这个地方威胁很大，差不多每年都要被它们损害成千成万斤粮食。前年我们调查了一下，平均每一蔸禾被害虫咬死的就有七八根。那时候，一些人对干旱、虫害的恐惧心理还不能彻底消除，他们还按老习惯把希望寄托在“天”上，干旱的时候，希望天下雨；虫害猖狂的时候，希望天起西风，把害虫“收”去。
    高级合作社建成以后，我们认识到了自己的力量。正如一些青年社员说的“我们要把增产掌握在自己手里”。社里在蒸坂上的六十多亩田，往年一到农历五月下旬，只要接连晴上几天，禾苗就会干绉，枯死。前年种一季早稻，用了五部水车接连车水抗旱，也干死了四十多亩。去年有了高级社，我们早就作了准备，用二百多个人工开了一条一丈多深、半里多长的大水沟。蒸坂上的这六十多亩田不仅不再怕旱，而且种上了双季稻。每亩产量由百来斤提高到八百四十斤。
    对于一般稻田我们也早就有了防旱的准备。过去水利私有，这里天旱的时候用水有“四不准”的规定。有的塘里水多，也不准别人车。这些规定使一些农民在抗旱紧张时刻不得不放下工作为水争吵；当然，也大大地妨碍了水利设备效能的充分发挥。高级合作化实现了，水塘、水坝入了社，我们就把所有的水利设备进行了合理调整，重新规定了各个塘坝的灌溉范围，水利设备的效能也就成倍地提高了。周家塘两个生产队六十三口水塘，往年只灌溉七十亩田地，去年就灌了一百六十二亩。这样一来，在抗旱紧张的时候，我们就有可能把力量集中在没有水利设备的田亩上面。去年夏天接连几十天没有下雨，有二百多亩没水利设备的田受旱，我们很快就集中了八十多个劳动力，四十多部水车，用“车接车、日连夜”的抗旱办法，把水从山那边引到这边来，终于把干旱战胜了。去年，我们这里没有一点虫害。前年冬天，当高级社刚建成的时候，我们就冒着严寒投入冬耕灭虫工作。田塍草铲光了，禾蔸拔光了，板田翻光了，虫子的爷娘都在冬天消灭了，当然它们也就没有子孙再来为害了。
