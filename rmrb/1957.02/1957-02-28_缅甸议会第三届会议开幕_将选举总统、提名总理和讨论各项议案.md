Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 27th: The Burmese Parliament began its third session on the 26th.

    The main agenda of this session is to elect a new President of the Union of Burma, nominate a new Prime Minister, and discuss bills and proposals put forward by the government or the opposition parties.

    The presidential election will be held on March 12th. The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma's decision to recommend Karen leader U Win Maung, the current Minister of Ports, Civil Aviation, and Coastal Shipping, as the new president, has been supported by the main opposition party, the Burma National United Front. It is believed that U Win Maung's election will contribute to national unity.

    It is reported that the session will nominate a new Prime Minister in the first week of March. The Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League has decided that U Nu, the chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, should resume the position of Prime Minister, which he resigned from last June. The Burmese Constitution stipulates that the new Prime Minister should be appointed by the President of the Union upon the nomination of the House of Representatives.

    Local newspapers reported that the opposition party, the Burma National United Front, will submit two proposals to the session, requesting the Burmese government to urge the early convening of the Second Asian-African Conference, and to organize a parliamentary committee composed of representatives of various parties in the parliament to try to restore domestic peace.

    It is understood that the third session will close on March 19th.

    缅甸议会第三届会议开幕
    将选举总统、提名总理和讨论各项议案
    新华社仰光27日电　缅甸议会26日开始举行第三届会议。
    这次会议的主要议程是选举缅甸联邦的新总统，提名一位新总理，并且讨论政府或反对党所提出的议案和提案。
    总统选举将在3月12日举行。缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟关于建议由克伦族领袖、现任港务、民间航运和沿海航运部长吴温貌任新总统的决定，已经受到主要反对党缅甸民族团结阵线的支持。吴温貌的当选被认为会有助于国家的团结。
    据报道，会议将在3月的第一周提名新总理。反法西斯人民自由同盟已经决定，反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努应当恢复他在去年6月辞去的总理职位。缅甸宪法规定，新总理应当由联邦总统根据代表院的提名来任命。
    当地报纸报道，反对党缅甸民族团结阵线将向会议提出两项提案，要求缅甸政府敦促早日举行第二次亚非会议，并且组织一个由议会各党派代表组成的议会委员会，以便设法恢复国内的和平。
    据悉，第三届会议将在3月19日闭幕。
