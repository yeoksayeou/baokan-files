Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, February 26th: While vigilantly guarding the coast, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front also consider supporting agricultural production cooperatives as their duty. Officers and soldiers often write letters to mobilize their families and relatives to love the cooperative as they love their home. Zhang Jintang, a squad leader of a certain unit, learned from a family letter that his family had withdrawn from the cooperative. He wrote home overnight to advise them against it and also wrote to the township head and his cousin in the cooperative to help him persuade them. Finally, his family happily returned to the cooperative. Liu Zhonghua, a new soldier from Shandong, heard that his hometown's agricultural cooperative was losing confidence in achieving a bumper harvest due to excessive rain. He immediately wrote back to encourage them to actively drain water and fight waterlogging. He also sent them a set of pictures showing how members of a Soviet collective farm struggled against natural disasters and finally achieved a bumper harvest. His enthusiasm deeply moved the director and members of this agricultural cooperative, who repeatedly wrote letters to thank him.

In order to reduce the burden of preferential treatment for military families on agricultural cooperatives, many officers and soldiers economize on food and clothing, sending money back to subsidize their families' lives or to help agricultural cooperatives solve financial difficulties. According to the statistics of one company, the money sent home by officers and soldiers in the last three months increased by 40% compared with the previous three months. When soldier Ji Shihou heard that his hometown's agricultural cooperative still lacked more than 30 yuan to build cattle and horse sheds, he put together 40 yuan and donated it to the agricultural cooperative.

As the spring plowing season approaches, the officers and soldiers of various units on the Fujian Front are busy preparing to help the agricultural cooperatives in their garrison areas with spring plowing production. Some companies have already signed support contracts with agricultural cooperatives. (Attached picture)

To strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are vigorously supporting the agricultural production cooperatives in their garrison areas in preparing for spring plowing production.

    福建前线各部队官兵
    把支援农业社当作自己的职责
    新华社福建前线26日电　福建前线的中国人民解放军官兵们在警惕地守卫海防的同时，还把支援农业生产合作社当作自己的职责。官兵们经常写信动员家属和亲友要爱社如家。某部班长张锦堂从家信中知道他的家属退了社，就连夜写信回家提出劝告，还写信请乡长和在社里的表兄帮助他做说服工作，终于使他的家属欢欢喜喜地回到社里。家在山东的新战士刘忠华听说自己家乡的农业社因为雨水过多，对争取丰收失掉信心，他立即写信回去鼓励他们积极排水抗涝，还送给他们一套苏联集体农庄庄员同自然灾害作斗争终于获得丰收的图片。他的热忱使这个农业社的社长和社员们深受感动，不断来信感谢他。
    为了减轻农业社优待军属的负担，许多部队官兵省吃俭用，寄钱回去补助家属生活，或是帮助农业社解决资金困难。据一个连队统计，最近三个月中官兵们寄回家去的钱比前三个月增加了40％。战士吉士厚听说家乡的农业社盖牛马棚还缺三十多元，他便凑了四十元捐赠给农业社。
    当春耕季节即将来临的时候，福建前线各部队的官兵们正在为帮助驻地农业社准备春耕生产而忙碌。有些连队已经同农业社订立了支援合同。（附图片）
