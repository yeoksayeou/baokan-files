    Products Extracted from the Air

    (Our dispatch) An industrial product extracted from the air – industrial argon – has recently been successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Nanjing Gas Manufacturing Plant using oxygen production equipment.  After testing by the Central Laboratory of the Nanjing Yongli Ning Factory, and verification by units such as the Nanjing Bulb Factory, the quality and purity of this argon gas reached 84%-86% of international standards.

    Industrial argon is the raw material for extracting pure argon and high-purity argon. It is needed for manufacturing lighting equipment such as fluorescent lamps and bulbs of 60 watts or more; it is needed for manufacturing radio vacuum tubes; and it is also needed in the metallurgical industry for smelting advanced alloy materials. In the past, the industrial argon used in our country relied on imports from foreign countries, which were expensive and could not meet the requirements of the country's increasingly developed industry. Therefore, the plant's engineer Jia Ruimei, advanced producer Wang Hechun, and others began trial production of argon gas using existing oxygen equipment in the fourth quarter of 1955. After one year and three months of hard work, they finally overcame difficulties and achieved success.

    After the plant successfully trial-produced industrial argon, units such as the Nanjing Bulb Factory and the Central Second Ministry of Machine Building successively put forward order requests.  To meet these needs, the workers are currently working intensively on the installation of intermediate factory equipment and are actively preparing to put it into production.

    从空气中提出的产品
    本报讯　一种从空气中提取出来的工业产品——工业用氩，最近已由地方国营南京气体制造厂在制氧设备上初步试制成功。经南京永利宁厂中央试验室化验报告、南京灯泡厂等单位检验证明，这种氩气的质量纯度达到了84％—86％的国际标准。
    工业用氩是提取纯氩、高纯氩的原料，制造日光灯及六十瓦以上的灯泡等照明设备需要它；制造无线电真空电子管需要它；冶金工业冶炼高级合金材料也需要它。过去我国使用的工业用氩都是依靠从国外进口，价格昂贵，而且还不能适应工业日益发展的要求。因此，这个厂的工程师贾瑞玫，先进生产者王鹤椿等，从1955年第四季度开始了利用原有的氧气设备生产氩气的试制工作，他们经过一年零三个月的刻苦钻研，终于战胜了困难，获得成功。
    当这个厂试制工业用氩成功后，南京灯泡厂、中央第二机械工业等单位就先后提出了订货要求。职工们为适应这些需要，最近正紧张地进行中间工厂设备安装工作，积极准备投入生产。
