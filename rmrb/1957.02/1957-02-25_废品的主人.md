These days, the scrap utilization warehouse of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company receives batches of customers every day who come to select various materials. They often arrive in a hurry and leave fully loaded after a short while.

Wang Shaowen, the warehouse manager of the scrap utilization warehouse, held two thick stacks of introduction letters and material acceptance forms from government agencies and enterprises when he received the reporter. While flipping through them, he said with great interest: "Since our scrap utilization warehouse was established last year, business has been booming day by day. No less than five or six hundred people have come to negotiate and purchase materials, many of whom come from as far away as Xinjiang, Tibet, Jiangsu, and Guizhou. At the beginning, monthly sales were less than 1,000 yuan, but now the monthly turnover is always tens of thousands of yuan, and there are often three or four hundred kinds of materials for sale."

Wang Shaowen recounted, as if listing family treasures, the role their new business is playing in production and construction.

Not long ago, they received a customer from Xingyi Sugar Factory in Guizhou. The complete set of machines for this newly built sugar factory could not start production due to the lack of a crankshaft and square steel. The factory had sent people to Shanghai, Beijing, Shenyang, and other places, but they couldn't find them. A technician came to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company with a feeling of "searching high and low without finding it." He finally found the crankshaft and square steel he needed in the storage yard of this scrap utilization warehouse.

The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Transportation had a batch of cars that could not run due to the lack of a certain type of ball bearing. The department sent people to purchase them everywhere, and it was not until several months later that they came to this scrap utilization warehouse and found a batch of ball bearings of good quality. In this way, forty large trucks that had been idle in the department for a long time were revived.

The various scrap stores of Chongqing Scrap Purchasing Station, many handicraft cooperatives and factories in Chongqing, have become regular customers of the scrap utilization warehouse. The auto parts scrap store alone purchases 40% of its goods from the scrap utilization warehouse. They sort or process the goods and then supply them to industrial, mining, transportation units and rural areas.

The role of the scrap utilization warehouse in helping Chongqing Iron and Steel Company overcome material difficulties, increase wealth, and reduce costs is even more significant. Once, when the large rolling mill workshop of the company was overhauling the rolling mill, the scrap utilization warehouse promptly supplied a batch of steel ball bearings that could not be bought on the market for a while, which enabled the overhaul work to proceed smoothly. Last year, the entire warehouse increased the company's wealth by more than 450,000 yuan, and this year it plans to increase wealth by 1.15 million yuan.

What exactly is the scrap utilization warehouse? How does it always have a steady stream of things for sale? The reporter visited this new institution with a sense of exploration.

In a scrap steel yard piled up like a mountain, several employees with pliers and magnets were busy selecting various steel parts. A young man named Luo Zhijun told us: He is a recovery staff member of the scrap utilization warehouse. The scrap steel for iron smelting continuously collected by the company from various places is piled up here. His daily duty is to "pan for gold" from the waste pile, specializing in selecting all kinds of useful steel materials and machine tool parts. He took out stainless steel, steel ball bearings, lead, etc., which he had just picked up, from a basket next to him and showed them to the reporter, introducing their identification methods and uses with relish. He said: "Since we have the scrap utilization warehouse, these things buried in the waste pile have owners who appreciate them. After our introduction, they can go to the places where they are most needed."

The reporter visited several departments under the scrap utilization warehouse—the oil refining room, the brick grinding room, the sewing room, and the wood processing room. In the oil refining room, workers were operating a rather ingenious oil refining machine made of waste materials. In the past, the machine oil used in the company's workshops flowed away from the underground passage. Now, they collect the waste machine oil from the company and other factories, and reuse it after refining it into good machine oil with the oil refining machine, which can save the company a large amount of machine oil costs every year. The brick grinding machine made of waste materials in the brick grinding room is constantly running. A worker operating the machine pointed to the piles of bricks around him and said: They want to grind the more than 200 tons of refractory bricks that were scrapped due to non-conforming sizes into qualified bricks as soon as possible, because the steelmaking workshop is eagerly waiting to use them. In the sewing room, a group of women specialize in collecting the protective clothing, gloves, etc. that have been damaged by various workshops, washing them clean, repairing them, and then sending them back to the workshops for use. In January of this year alone, they sewed more than 3,400 pairs of gloves, which can save the company more than 1,000 yuan in glove purchase costs.

The work of the scrap utilization warehouse employees is hard and cumbersome. They run all over the corners of the company all day long to discover all kinds of abandoned ownerless scrap. They not only collect discarded metal materials, machine oil, refractory bricks, protective equipment, but also wooden box boards, straw bags, straw ropes, broken rubber shoes, empty medicine bottles, and other various things, all of which are well collected, sorted and processed, and then used in various aspects of production and construction.

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is a large enterprise unit. In the past, without the establishment of a specialized organization like the scrap utilization warehouse, many discarded materials and items were not properly managed and utilized, which invisibly caused great waste. After this institution was established, it only spends tens of thousands of yuan in employee wages each year, but it can increase the company's income by more than one million yuan this year; its supporting role for the materials of many units is even more important.

### 废品的主人

    废品的主人
    新华社记者  胡明俊
    这几天，重庆钢铁公司的利废库，天天都要接待一批挑选各式材料的顾客。他们常常是匆匆而来，不多一阵，便满载而去。
    利废库的库长王绍文在接待记者的时候，抱了厚厚两叠机关、企业的介绍信和材料承交单。他一边翻，一边兴致勃勃地说：“我们这个利废库去年成立以来，生意一天比一天兴旺，来接洽、选购材料的不下五、六百人次，其中有不少是远自新疆、西藏、江苏、贵州等地区来的。开始每月售货不到一千元，现在每月营业额总是好几万元，经常出售的材料有三、四百种。”
    王绍文如数家珍般地叙述他们的新事业在生产建设中所显示的作用。
    不久以前，他们接待了来自贵州兴义糖厂的一位顾客。这个新建糖厂的全套机器因为缺少一根曲轴和方钢，不能开工生产。厂里曾经派人到上海、北京、沈阳等地，也没有找到。一位技术员带着踏破铁鞋无觅处的心情，来到了重庆钢铁公司。他终于在这个利废库的放料场上发现了他所需要的曲轴和方钢。
    江苏省交通厅有一批汽车，因为缺乏一种弹子不能行驶。厅里派人四处采购，直到几个月以后来到这个利废库，才找到了一批质量很好的弹子。这样在厅里躺了很久的四十部大卡车就此复活了。
    重庆废品收购站的各废品商店，重庆许多手工业合作社和工厂，已经成了利废库的经常顾客。单是汽车零件废品商店，就有40％的货是从利废库采购的。它们把进货整理或加工，再供应工矿交通单位和农村。
    利废库对重庆钢铁公司克服材料困难、增加财富、降低成本的作用，就更加显著了。有一次，公司大轧钢车间大修轧钢机的时候，由于利废库及时供应了一批在市场上一时不能买到的钢珠轴承，使大修工作顺利进行。全库去年为公司增加的财富在四十五万元以上，今年计划要增加财富一百一十五万元。
    究竟利废库是个什么样的机构呢？它怎么经常有许多东西源源出售呢？记者带着探索的心情参观了这个新机构。
    在一个堆积如山的废钢铁场上，几个拿着钳子、吸铁石的职工，正在忙着选拣许多钢铁件。一位叫罗志均的青年告诉我们：他是利废库的回收人员，公司从各地不断收集来的炼铁用的废钢铁，都堆放在这里。他每天的职责，就是从“沙里淘金”，专门选拣各式各样有用的钢料和机具零件。他从旁边一个箩筐里，取出刚拣到的不锈钢、钢珠轴承、铅等给记者看，津津有味地介绍它们的辨识方法和用途。他说：“自从有了利废库，这些埋没在废堆中的东西就有了赏识它们的主人。经过我们的介绍，它们就可以到最需要的地方去。”
    记者参观了利废库下设的几个部门——炼油房、磨砖房、缝补房、木料加工房。在炼油房里，工人们正在开动着用废料装成的颇为灵巧的炼油机。过去，公司车间的机器上用过的机油，便从地道里流走了。现在他们把公司里和外厂的废机油收集起来，利用炼油机重新炼成好机油再用，每年可为公司节约一大笔机油费。磨砖房用废料装成的磨砖机，正在不停地转动着。操纵机器的一个工人指着周围满堆着的砖说：他们要在尽快的时间内，把两百多吨因尺寸规格不合而报废的耐火砖，精细地磨成合格的砖，因为炼钢车间急切等待着使用它们。在缝补房里，有一批妇女专门将各车间用坏了的保护服、手套等收集起来，把它们洗干净，修补好再发到车间去用。仅在今年1月份，她们就缝补了三千四百多双手套，可替公司节约一千多元的手套购置费。
    利废库职工们的工作是辛勤而繁琐的。他们成天跑遍公司的各个角落，去发掘各种被弃掷的没有主人的废品。他们不但收集废弃的金属材料、机油、耐火砖、保护用具，就连木箱板、草包、草绳、破胶鞋、空药瓶等各式各样东西，也都很好地收集起来，分门别类地整理和加工，再将它们利用到生产建设的各个方面去。
    重庆钢铁公司是一个较大的企业单位，过去没有成立利废库这样的专门机构，许多被废弃的材料物品没有被妥善的管理利用，无形中形成很大浪费。这个机构建立以后，每年只不过开支几万元的职工工资费，但是它在今年内就可以为这个公司增加一百多万元的收入；它对许多单位物资材料的支援作用，就更为重要了。
