Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: Tunis dispatch: Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba delivered a radio address on the evening of the 18th concerning the relationship between Tunisia and France. He stated that Tunisia could not consider reopening negotiations regarding the future relations between the two countries until all French troops had withdrawn from Tunisia.

Bourguiba said that French troops should strictly adhere to the pre-arranged timetable for phased withdrawals by region, and only then could Tunisia and France begin to resolve issues such as the joint defense of the Bizerte base. Otherwise, Tunisia could not consider reopening negotiations, because its will would not be freely expressed during those negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: Algiers dispatch: In recent days, French troops, while fighting Algerian People's Armed Forces, have deployed aircraft to drop tear gas bombs and highly lethal shrapnel bombs, and have conducted low-altitude strafing runs. Intense fighting has occurred between French troops and Algerian People's Armed Forces in the southwestern and southeastern regions of Oran. The French troops participating in the fighting are mainly paratrooper units.

The Algerian rebel people are still very active behind French lines. On the 17th, three French military trucks were ambushed on the road from Affreville to Teniet El Had, and the vehicles were pushed into a ravine. On the 16th, an express train from Algiers to Oran derailed because the tracks were sabotaged.

The French colonial authorities continue to make large-scale arrests in various places. Among the latest batch of those arrested are several Europeans.

    突尼斯首相要法军滚出去
    法军竟在阿尔及利亚使用毒气弹
    新华社19日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯首相布尔吉巴18日晚上就突尼斯和法国关系问题发表广播演说。他说：在法军全部撤出突尼斯以前，突尼斯不能考虑重开有关两国未来联系的谈判的问题。
    布尔吉巴说：法军应该严格遵守预先拟定的时间表按地区分批撤退，然后法突两国才能着手解决像共同防守比塞大基地这样一些问题。否则，突尼斯就不能考虑重开谈判的问题，因为在谈判中它的意志将不能获得自由。
    新华社19日讯　阿尔及尔消息：最近几天来，法军在同阿尔及利亚人民武装部队作战的时候，出动飞机投掷催泪性瓦斯弹和杀伤力很大的榴霰弹，并且进行低飞扫射。法军同阿尔及利亚人民武装部队在阿兰西南和东南两个地区内发生激烈战斗。法军参加战斗的主要是伞兵部队。
    阿尔及利亚起义人民在法军后方仍然非常活跃。17日有法军三辆军用卡车在从阿佛霍维尔通往当尼耶·艾尔·哈德的公路上遭到伏击，车辆被推入峡谷。16日，有一列由阿尔及尔开往阿兰的快车因为路轨被破坏而翻车。
    法殖民当局继续在各地大肆捕人。在最近一批被捕者当中，有若干人是欧洲人。
