    Mistakes in the Names of Two Famous Painting Mounters

    In Mr. Fu Baoshi's article "The Difficulty of Painting Mounting," published in the People's Daily on January 3rd, the names of two famous painting mounters in Suzhou, "Cao Zhongqing" and "Xie Songquan," were mentioned. Both of these names are incorrect. They should be Cao Songqing and Xie Genbao. The former was mistaken due to similar pronunciation, and the latter was likely mistaken due to the cursive script.

    弄错了两位裱画名手的名字
    1月3日人民日报曾刊载傅抱石先生的“裱画难”一文，其中提到苏州两位裱画名手“曹仲卿”和“谢松全”。这两位的名字都错了，应该是曹颂清和谢根宝，前者因音近而误，后者想系草书所误。
