    Expanding the Authority of the Republics in Managing the Economy
    The Soviet Union Transfers a Large Number of Enterprises to the Republics
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st - To date, the Soviet Union has transferred 15,000 industrial and transportation enterprises, formerly under the management of the entire Soviet Union, to the administration of the various republics. Currently, approximately 50% of Soviet industrial products are manufactured by enterprises managed by the republics and local authorities.
    Transferring a large number of enterprises to the republics is one of the most important measures taken by the Soviet Communist Party and government to expand the authority of the republics in managing the economy. According to this measure, many enterprises formerly led by all-Union ministries have been handed over to the direct leadership of the ministries of the various republics. In addition, in order to eliminate the past shortcomings of over-centralized economic leadership, the Soviet Party and government have also decided to transfer the power to allocate daily necessities and manage commercial networks to the relevant institutions of the republics and major cities. The central government is only responsible for coordinating the daily necessities between the republics.
    The republics' fiscal budgetary powers have also been expanded. They can now freely dispose of allocations within the scope of the all-Union budget. The republics have the right to make decisions on many economic construction issues, such as basic construction, material and technological allocation, product costs and sales, and the financial aspects of enterprises. At the same time, on the basis of the central unified plan, the republics and local authorities are now able to play a greater initiative in formulating economic plans.
    Judging from the results of recent implementation, these measures have greatly improved the initiative of the republics in economic leadership, reduced many unnecessary management organizations, thereby promoting the development of production and reducing production costs. For example, after the Azerbaijan Republic took over the management of the republic's oil enterprises from the all-Union ministries, it streamlined many trusts and other intermediate management organizations that had been established in the past, greatly reduced non-production expenditures, and used material resources and equipment more economically. As a result, the Republic's Ministry of Petroleum Industry gained a production profit of 87 million rubles beyond the plan last year.

    扩大各加盟共和国在管理经济方面的权限
    苏联把大批企业移交各共和国
    新华社莫斯科21日电　到目前为止，苏联已经把一万五千个过去归全苏联管理的工业企业和交通运输企业划归各加盟共和国管理。现在，苏联工业产品中已经约有50％是由属于加盟共和国和各地方管理的企业制造出来的。
    把大批企业交给各加盟共和国管理，这是苏联共产党和政府实行的扩大各加盟共和国在管理经济方面的权限的最重要的措施之一。根据这项措施，过去许多由全联盟的部领导的企业已经交给各加盟共和国的部直接领导。此外，为了消除过去经济领导过分集中的缺点，苏联党和政府还决定把日用品的分配和商业网的管理权也移交给加盟共和国和各大城市的有关机构，中央政府只负责调剂各共和国间的日用品。
    各共和国的财政预算权也扩大了。现在，它们已经可以自由支配全苏联预算范围内的拨款。许多经济建设方面的问题，如基本建设、物资技术的调配、关于产品成本和销售以及关于企业的财政方面的问题，各加盟共和国都有权作出决定。同时，在中央统一计划的基础上，各加盟共和国和地方在制定经济计划方面现在已经能够发挥更大的主动性。
    从最近实施的成果看，这些措施已经大大提高了各加盟共和国在经济领导方面的主动性，减少了许多不必要的管理机构，从而促进了生产的发展和生产成本的降低。例如，阿塞拜疆共和国在从全联盟的部接收了对共和国石油企业的管理权以后，就精简了过去设立的许多托辣斯和其他中间管理机构，大大减少了非生产开支和更经济地使用了物质资源和设备，因而使得共和国的石油工业部在去年超计划获得了八千七百万卢布的生产利润。
