　　Song of Spring
　　Shan Fu
　　The fourth night of the Lunar New Year, the last night of the Spring Festival.

　　Snowflakes are fluttering outside the window. From time to time, the sound of firecrackers comes from afar. Whose child is holding their ears while lighting them with an incense stick?

　　The room is as warm as spring. The radiator is hissing, and the desk lamp casts a soft, warm light through its green shade. The daffodils blooming on the bookshelf are tinged with a layer of tender green, making them appear even more simple and lovely. The radio is broadcasting a movement by Tchaikovsky, and the piccolo is playing a melody like a gurgling stream. Everything seems so harmonious, warm, and comfortable. I lean back on the sofa, flipping through the almost-finished "The Red and the Black."

　　Suddenly, the melodious piccolo sound was choked off, and the voice of a female announcer came: "Attention comrades listening, this is an emergency notice from the Northeast Workers' Hospital. At around 7:00 PM tonight, a little patient named Liu Yanfei was brought to the hospital by his mother for treatment. Due to a nurse's carelessness, the wrong medicine was dispensed. This medicine is very dangerous. We hope the patient's parents, after hearing this, will not administer it. The patient is only three months old, and his parents work at the Municipal Committee. We hope that comrades who know his home address will quickly notify him after hearing this...."

　　Once, twice, three times, the announcer repeated this unfortunate news. Her voice was not as clear as before, but low. From her voice, I could almost see her anxious expression. I listened and listened, and the book slipped from my hand without me noticing. My wife was coaxing Xiao Ming to sleep, originally pacing back and forth while humming a lullaby. At this moment, she also stood still like a statue in front of the child's crib, holding the child even tighter, as if afraid someone would take him away. The child was already slightly asleep, his long eyelashes drooping like curtains over his eyes, his little cheeks as red as apples. He lay happily in his mother's arms, unaware that snow was gently falling outside the window, and unaware that an infant a few months younger than him was being attacked by a terrible shadow.

　　Neither of us spoke. I looked at the watch, it was already 9:15 PM. Ah! More than two hours had passed since the nurse dispensed the wrong medicine. Has the child's mother already fed him the medicine, spoonful by spoonful? Is she listening to the broadcast now, rejoicing that her child has not suffered misfortune due to someone else's mistake? Perhaps the child has already taken the medicine and is lying in his mother's arms, and the mother still knows nothing, filled with great confidence, hoping that the little baby will get better after taking the medicine! Ah! Let us bless her! May the child not have taken the medicine yet, may the people sent out by the hospital find her immediately, and may the kind people who know her home hurry to notify her.

　　My wife hugged the child tightly, even though he was already asleep, his little nostrils fluttering, but she was unwilling to put him in the crib as she usually did. She looked at me anxiously from time to time. Ah! What she was thinking at this moment must be the same as me. We are both people with children. We know that the hearts of parents are closely connected to the hearts of their children. Even a slightly heavier breath from the child will cause a mother's heart to flutter!

　　Throughout the evening, we spoke very little. Our hearts were completely occupied by the fate of that unfamiliar child named Liu Yanfei. It reminded me of an unfortunate childhood. At that time, a little companion of mine, my cousin Xiao Mei, died after taking the wrong medicine from the doctor. But the doctor denied it against his conscience and even forced my aunt to pay for the medicine. Thinking of this, I stood up several times, wanting to rush out the door to notify the mother of the child who might be facing misfortune. But in such a big Shenyang, where could I find her? I helplessly sat down again...

　　The night grew deep. My wife put the child in the crib, covering him with the blanket more carefully than usual, and then went to sleep herself. I still didn't want to sleep, still leaning against the sofa, lighting a cigarette. With the graceful blue smoke, I thought a lot, thought very far.

　　From the child who might be facing misfortune, I thought of that careless nurse. When she discovered her mistake, she must have been more upset than anyone else; how pale her face would be, how painful her heart would be! When she bravely reported the mistake she had made to the on-duty supervisor, she was not thinking about the punishment she would receive, but about the child's life. The nursing staff's duty to rescue the dying and heal the wounded is the honor of all the white-clad angels. Moreover, if she knew that not only the child's family, not only the entire hospital, but the people of the entire city, due to her mistake, turned a joyful holiday into an anxious night, she would be even more severe in her self-reproach. At this time, she would deeply realize what kind of big family we live in, a great collective of shared destiny! The irresponsibility and negligence of any working comrade will bring misfortune and loss to this collective. And what role will the slightest contribution of any comrade play for this collective!

　　It is precisely because of this understanding that we can be conscientious and diligent in fulfilling our responsibilities in the cause of building socialism. This couldn't help but make me think that at this late hour, coal miners all over the country are working deep underground, wielding black sweat, digging precious black gold for us, one pickaxe at a time – coal that brings light and heat to all mankind. In this climate of thirty degrees below zero, being able to spend such a joyful holiday so warmly and happily, how can we not deeply thank them, not bless this great collective!

　　The night grew deeper, looking out the window, the snowflakes were still falling lightly and silently, and my thoughts grew longer and longer...

　　The next morning, I turned on the radio with a hopeful mood. The familiar voice of the female announcer came again: "Reporting everyone's most concerned good news, the little patient Liu Yanfei we broadcast about last night, he did not take the wrong medicine. His parents listened to the broadcast that night and immediately went to the hospital to change the medicine. Now the child's condition has improved, and he is lying lively in the crib playing. Thank you to the dozens of enthusiastic comrades who rode their bicycles through the wind and snow that night to deliver the message to his home..."

　　Ah! How clear her voice is! Almost like the orioles singing on the willow branches in early spring. My heart is also singing joyfully! The snow stopped sometime, and a ray of brilliant sunshine shone in through the glass. With indescribable sweet emotion, I began my first day of work after the Spring Festival.

    春之歌
    单复
    大年初四晚上，春节的最后一个夜晚。
    窗外飘着雪花。不时远远传来几声爆竹，是谁家孩子一边捂着耳朵，一边用根香头点放的呢？
    屋里温暖如春，暖气吱吱响着，台灯透过绿色灯罩，撒下柔和、温馨的光。书架上盛开的水仙花，晕上一层嫩绿的颜色，显得更素净可爱了。收音机播送着柴可夫斯基的乐章，短笛正吹奏出淙淙流水似的声调。一切是显得如此和谐、温暖而舒适。我斜倚在沙发上，把快读完了的“红与黑”翻开来。
    突然，悠扬的短笛声哽住了，传来了女播音员的声音：“各位收听同志注意，这是东北工人医院的紧急通知。在今晚七时左右，有个叫刘雁飞的小患者，妈妈抱他来医院看病，因护士不小心，配错了药。这药很危险，希望患者家长收听后，不要服用。患者是个仅三个月的婴儿，家长在市委会工作，希望知道他家地址的同志，收听后赶快通知他……。”
    一遍、两遍、三遍，播音员重复着这不幸的消息。她的声音没有以前那么清亮，低低的。从她的声音里，我几乎看到了她的焦虑不安的神色。我听着，听着，书本从手里滑出来，没有觉察。妻正哄着小明睡觉，她本来是一边踱着，一边哼着催眠曲，这时，也像塑像似地呆呆立在孩子的小床前，双手把孩子抱得更紧，像怕谁夺去似的。孩子已经微微睡着了，长长的睫毛像帘子般的垂下来，复在双眼上，小颊房红得像苹果，他幸福地躺在母亲怀里，不知窗外正轻轻地飘着雪花，也不知有个比他小几个月的婴儿，正在被可怕的阴影袭击着。
    我们都没有说话。我看看表，已经是九点一刻了。啊！离护士配错药的时间也过了二个多钟头。孩子的妈妈是不是已经一小匙、一小匙地把药给喂了呢？是不是她这时也正听了播音，庆幸自己的孩子没因别人的过失而造成不幸呢？或许孩子已经吃了药，正躺在妈妈怀里，而妈妈还什么都不知道，怀着莫大的信心，希望小宝宝吃了药，病就会好转呢！啊！让我们祝福她吧！愿孩子还没吃药，愿医院派出去的人能立刻找到她，愿好心的、知道她家的人，赶紧跑去通知她吧。
    妻紧紧地搂着孩子，虽然他已经睡着了，小鼻梁呼扇呼扇的，但她却不愿像往日一样，把他放在小床里。她不时焦躁地看我一眼。啊！她这时心里所想的，一定和我一样。我们都是有孩子的人，我们 知道爸爸妈妈的心，是紧紧地和孩子的心连着的。孩子一个较粗的呼吸，都会引来妈妈一阵心悸呢！
    整个晚上，我们都很少说话。我们的心，全被那个叫刘雁飞的不熟悉的孩子的命运占去了。它使我想起不幸的童年，那时，我的一个小伴侣，叫小梅的表妹，她就是吃错了医生的药死去的，但医生却昧着良心不承认，还逼着姑妈还他的药钱。想到这里，我几次站起来想冲出门去，去通知那个可能遭遇不幸的孩子的妈妈。可是，这么大的沈阳，到哪里去找她呢？我又无可奈何地坐下来……
    夜深了，妻把孩子放在小床里，比平日更小心地给他盖好了被子，然后自己也睡下了。我却还不想睡，依然斜靠在沙发里，点了一颗烟，随着袅娜的蓝色的烟云，我想得很多，想得很远。
    从可能遭遇不幸的孩子身上，我想到了那个粗心大意的护士，当她发现了自己的差错之后，她一定是比谁都要难过的；她的脸色会是怎样的苍白，心会是怎样的绞痛啊！当她勇敢地把自己造成的错误，向总值班报告时，她想到的不是自己将受到的责罚，而是孩子的生命。护理人员救死扶伤的职责，是全体白衣天使的荣誉。而且，她要是晓得不仅是孩子一家，不仅是整个医院，而是全市的人民，都由于她底过失，使一个欢乐的节日，变为焦虑不安的夜晚时，她对自己的呵责，就会更加严厉了。这时候，她就会深深地认识到，我们是生活在一个怎样的大家庭里，一个休戚相关的伟大的集体中啊！任何一个工作同志的不负责任和疏忽，都会给这个集体带来不幸和损失。而任何一个同志的微小的贡献，对于这个集体又将起怎样的作用！
    正是由于这种认识，我们在建设社会主义的事业中，才能兢兢业业地尽自己的职责。这不禁使我想到就在这夜深时刻，全国的煤矿工人在地层底下，挥着黑色的汗珠，一镐一镐地为我们挖掘宝贵的黑金——给全人类带来光和热的煤。我们在零下三十度严寒的气候下，能够这么温暖，这么幸福地过着欢乐的节日，怎能不深深地感激他们，不为这个伟大的集体祝福呢！
    夜更深了，看看窗外，雪花仍然轻轻地、无声地飘着，我的思绪是越抽越长了……。
    第二天早晨，我带着希望的心情打开了收音机，女播音员的熟悉的声音又传来了：“报告大家最关心的一个好消息，昨天晚上我们播送的那个小患者刘雁飞，他没有吃错药，当夜他的家长收听了播音，就马上到医院换药，现在孩子的病已好转，活活泼泼地躺在小床上玩呢。感谢当夜骑着脚踏车，冒着风雪，去给他家送信的几十个热心的同志……”
    啊！她的声音是多么清亮啊！简直像初春柳枝上鸣叫的黄鹂。我的心也欢快地歌唱着！雪不知什么时候停息了，一道灿烂的阳光从玻璃上射进来。我带着说不出的甜美的感情，开始了春节后的第一天的工作。
