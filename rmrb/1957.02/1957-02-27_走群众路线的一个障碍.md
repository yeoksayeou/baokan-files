An Obstacle to Following the Mass Line
Dong Jingrong

After reading the article "The Director of the Commune Learns a New Method of Leadership" published in the People's Daily on January 11th, I feel that the rigid implementation of instructions from above, as Comrade He Zhengwen did previously, is a relatively common phenomenon in the current work of rural cadres. Learning to use the working method of following the mass line to do a good job is a common requirement for rural cadres today.

I am the Party Branch Secretary of Guangxingzhou Township in Yueyang County, Hunan Province. I am very eager to learn the leadership method of following the mass line. However, I always feel that the rigid application by rural cadres is somewhat forced, and it is difficult to learn the working method of following the mass line. I can use a few personally experienced facts to illustrate this point: During last year's spring plowing production, in order to achieve the requirement of a "thousand-jin district," the double-cropping rice planting area was expanded from the original 21% to 83%, regardless of the opposition from the masses; in the most extreme communes it was planted up to 94%. After planting, due to a lack of fertilizer, the early rice grew poorly. With the harvest season approaching, the seedlings in some fields were still flattened grass, without any ears. If the early rice were harvested, each mu could only yield sixty or seventy jin, and the late rice season would be missed; if it were plowed up and replanted with glutinous rice or if late rice were rushed in early, each mu could yield four or five hundred jin. Therefore, the masses demanded to plow up the early rice and replant with glutinous rice or late rice. After hearing the opinions of the masses, we immediately reported the fields that needed to be replanted and the reasons for replanting to the county committee by telephone three times in succession. The county committee instructed: strengthen nurturing, and resolutely do not allow replanting. I was forced by the constant reflections of the masses, and after inspecting the fields with the commune cadres, I violated the instructions of the county committee and reluctantly agreed to the masses to replant, plowing up more than 1,300 mu of early rice. Subsequently, I was severely criticized by the county committee, and I was used as a typical example for criticism at three expanded county cadre meetings. But, what was the result? The average yield of early rice in the whole township, including the good fields, was only 220 jin per mu, and the late rice yielded 160 jin; while the replanted fields averaged 470 jin per mu. Wang Qingsheng, a member of the Puxing Commune, said: "If we hadn't bravely replanted dozens of mu of early rice, we would have almost starved."

In July last year, while rushing to harvest the early rice and planting late rice, in order to make up for the loss of early rice production, the county party secretary personally consulted with the masses and found a way to rush plant 2,200 mu of Hongtian [flooded fields], and increase the yield by 1.1 million jin of rice, which could be achieved as long as the waterlogged Hongtian were drained. Subsequently, the situation changed, and there was a long period of sunny weather without rain. Severe drought occurred in more than 20,000 mu of fertile land. The water level of rivers and lakes dropped, making irrigation impossible. The water source of the inland lake was cut off, and it was necessary to rely on Hongtian to store water for drought resistance, making it impossible to rush plant rice. We reported the situation to the county committee by telephone twice more, but the county committee still criticized us for not being firm. It was not until Li Langqiu, a member of the county committee and deputy county head, personally came down to inspect and, under the pressure of the opinions of the masses, stopped the drainage of water from Hongtian. This time, only some labor was wasted, and no greater losses were suffered.

These facts make me feel that: rigidly implementing the instructions from above, and if there are deviations, the problem is not too big; flexibly implementing the instructions from above according to local conditions, if there are deviations, who is responsible? This is an obstacle to how our grassroots cadres can proceed from reality and learn the method of following the mass line to do a good job.

If we want to change this phenomenon, I think: on the one hand, grassroots cadres should strengthen their subjective efforts, improve their working methods, and listen to the opinions of the masses more; on the other hand, the higher authorities should not prescribe the working steps for the lower levels too rigidly, but should boldly and freely allow grassroots cadres to give play to their creativity and initiative in their work, and should also conduct more in-depth investigation and research and carefully listen to the situation and opinions reflected by grassroots cadres. Otherwise, it is impossible to simply ask grassroots cadres to improve their working methods.

    走群众路线的一个障碍
    董竞戎
    我看了人民日报1月11日所载“社主任学会了新的领导方法”一文以后，感到像何政文同志以前那样生搬硬套地执行上级的指示，是当前农村干部工作中一个较普遍的现象。学会走群众路线的工作方法来做好工作，是当前农村干部一个共同的要求。
    我是湖南岳阳县广兴洲乡的总支书记。我是非常渴望学会走群众路线的领导方法的。但是，我总认为农村干部的生搬硬套是有些被迫的，要学会走群众路线的工作方法是有困难的。我可以用几件亲身经历的事实来说明这点：在去年春耕生产的时候，为了实现“千斤区”的要求，不顾群众的反对，把双季稻种植面积由原来的21％扩大到83％；最多的社种到94％。插下去以后，由于肥料缺乏，早稻生长不良，眼看收割季节就要到了，部分田的苗还是扁草，没有着胎。如果要收早稻，每亩只能收六、七十斤，并且晚稻又要错过季节；如果要犁掉改插糯稻或提早赶插晚稻，每亩可产四、五百斤。因此，群众纷纷要求犁掉早稻改插糯稻或晚稻。我们听到了群众的意见以后，随即把需要改插的田亩和改插的理由，用电话连续三次上报县委，县委指示：要加工培育，坚决不许改插。我被群众不断的反映所逼，同社干们到田间进行了察看之后，违背县委的指示，勉强答应群众改插，犁掉一千三百多亩早稻。随后我就遭到了县委的严厉批评，开三次县扩大干部会，都把我当作典型来批判。可是，结果怎样呢？全乡的早稻连好的在内平均每亩只收二百二十斤，晚稻收一百六十斤；而改插的平均每亩却收了四百七十斤。普兴社社员王庆生说：“我们不是壮起胆子改插几十亩早稻，险些要饿肚子。”
    去年7月，正在抢收早稻插晚稻的时候，为了弥补早稻减产的损失，县委书记亲自和群众商量，找到了抢插二千二百亩洪田、增收一百一十万斤稻谷的门路，只要排干洪田渍水就可实现。随后情况变化，久晴不雨，二万多亩良田发生了严重的旱灾，江湖水位低落，不能灌溉，内湖水源断绝，要靠洪田蓄水抗旱，不能赶插稻谷。我们又两次用电话向县委反映情况，县委还批评我们不坚决。直到县委委员兼副县长李朗秋亲自下来察看，在群众意见的压力下，才停止了洪田渍水的外排。这一次，仅浪费了一些人工，没有遭到更大的损失。
    这些事实使我总感到：生搬硬套地贯彻执行上级的指示，出了偏差，问题倒还不大；根据本地情况灵活地执行上级指示，倘若出了偏差，谁负责任？这是我们基层干部如何从实际出发、学会走群众路线的方法来搞好工作的一个障碍。
    如果要改变这种现象，我认为：一方面基层干部要加强主观努力，改进自己的工作方法，多倾听群众意见；另一方面，上级也不要把下面的工作步骤规定得太死，要大胆地放手地让基层干部在工作中发挥创造性和积极性，还要很好地多多深入调查研究，认真倾听一下基层干部反映的情况和意见。否则，单要基层干部改进工作方法，那是不可能的。
