Xinhua News Agency, February 25th - Vice Minister Zeng Chuanliu of the Ministry of Commerce reported at the Seventh National Conference of Commerce Bureau Directors convened by the ministry today that this year's movement to increase production and practice economy in the Ministry of Commerce system will focus on further improving commodity circulation, ensuring market supply of materials, improving business management, and striving to reduce expenses. Through these measures, the aim is to promote production development, guide consumption, expand capital accumulation, and ensure the needs of national construction. Furthermore, this movement will establish a regular system of increasing production and practicing economy within the commercial system, fostering among the broad masses of employees the idea of cherishing state property, careful budgeting, diligence in running enterprises, and a spirit of hard work and plain living.

Zeng Chuanliu said that in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the staff of the Ministry of Commerce system must actively and systematically expand the organization of goods supply, replenish material strength, and do a good job in supply work. They must rationally adjust the commercial network, reduce commodity circulation links, strive to reduce circulation costs, and realistically simplify systems and reports.

Zeng Chuanliu said that expanding the organization of goods supply must be carried out in a differentiated and planned manner, based on the specific circumstances of production and sales. For major commodities that are under unified planning and allocation with a certain limitation on the source of goods, all localities must make proper arrangements in terms of supply targets within the region to ensure rational supply. For commodities that are unbalanced or tight in supply and demand, efforts should be made to tap the potential of local production based on the availability of raw materials. For other commodities, especially those suitable for rural consumption, as long as there is a market and no shortage of raw materials, efforts should be made to actively organize the supply of goods and strive to promote sales. In organizing the supply of goods, attention must be paid to the consumption needs of the masses. Some commodities accumulated in various localities that are not suitable for sale locally but are needed or even out of stock in other regions should be organized for exchange and adjustment. In terms of saving commodity circulation costs, this year it is required to save about 4% of the total circulation costs on the basis of 1956, excluding objectively increased or decreased cost factors. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to rationally adjust the commercial network, reduce commodity circulation links, implement rational transportation and direct transportation, and overcome the phenomena of roundabout, counter-current, and reverse-flow transportation. If transportation costs can be saved by 5% throughout the year, more than 30 million yuan can be saved. In addition, it is also necessary to do a good job in commodity storage, reduce commodity losses, adjust organizational structures, streamline staffing, and save expenses in all aspects.

Zeng Chuanliu said that in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Ministry of Commerce system must also maintain contact with production departments, continuously improve product quality, save raw materials, and strengthen publicity work to guide the masses in saving on the consumption of certain commodities.

    改进商品流转工作、做好市场供应、提高经营水平、降低费用
    商业部提出增产节约中心要求
    新华社25日讯　商业部副部长曾传六今天在这个部召开的第七届全国商业厅局长会议上报告说，今年商业部系统的增产节约运动，将以进一步改进商品流转工作，做好市场物资供应，提高经营管理水平，努力降低费用为中心，通过这些，达到促进生产发展，指导消费，扩大资金积累，保证国家建设需要的目的。并且通过这个运动，使增产节约成为商业系统一种经常的制度，在广大职工中，树立爱护国家财产、精打细算、勤俭办企业的思想和艰苦朴素的作风。
    曾传六说，商业部系统的工作人员在增产节约运动中，要积极地有计划地扩大组织货源，充实物资力量，做好供应工作，要合理调整商业网，减少商品流转环节，努力降低流转费用，实事求是地简化制度和报表。
    曾传六说，扩大组织货源必须根据生产和销售的具体情况，有区别地并且是有计划地进行。凡是属于计划统一分配而且货源有一定限制的主要商品，各地要在地区上同供应对象上作妥善安排，作到合理供应；属于供求不平衡或偏紧的商品，应该根据原料的情况，努力发掘地方生产的潜力；其他商品，特别是适合于农村消费的商品，只要市场有销路，原料不缺乏，都应该积极组织货源，努力推销。在组织货源的时候，必须注意群众的消费需要。各地积存的一些不适合在当地销售而又为其他地区所需要甚至脱销的商品，要组织交流和调剂。在节约商品流转费用方面，今年要求在1956年的基础上，除去客观上应增加或减少的费用因素以外，节约流转费用总额的4％左右。要达到这个指标，必须合理调整商业网，减少商品流转环节；贯彻合理运输和直达运输，克服迂回、相向、倒流运输的现象，如果全年节约运输费用5％，就能节约三千多万元；此外还要做好商品保管工作，降低商品的损耗，调整组织机构，精简编制，并且从各方面节省费用开支。
    曾传六说，在增产节约运动中，商业部系统还必须同生产部门联系，不断提高产品质量，节省原材料，还要加强宣传工作，指导群众对某些商品的消费进行节约。
