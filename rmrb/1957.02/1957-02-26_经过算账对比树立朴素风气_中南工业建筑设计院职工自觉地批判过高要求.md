Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 25th: The Central South Industrial Architectural Design Institute adopted the method of accounting and comparison to conduct political and ideological work among its employees during the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and achieved good results.

At the beginning of December last year, after conveying and studying the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the design institute, based on the specific circumstances of its departments, launched the work of accounting for four things: accounting for waste in engineering design, accounting for waste in administrative management, comparing wage increases with production increases, and accounting for personal living arrangements and whether housing is adequate. Their accounting method was to first select typical cases, calculate detailed accounts in groups, and then select a few representative people and events to report to all comrades, inspiring everyone to conduct discussions and self-criticism. Through in-depth accounting and recollection of comparisons, everyone's understanding was generally improved, and a trend of increasing production, practicing economy, and working hard gradually developed.

In design work, technical personnel have put forward a large number of suggestions for increasing production and practicing economy. The institute leadership has already formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy and corresponding measures based on everyone's suggestions. On the premise of ensuring quality, various design offices have recently revised more than 30 design projects, saving a total of 510,000 yuan, more than 980 tons of steel, and more than 1,800 tons of cement.

After accounting for the waste of administrative management expenses, it was found that the waste was quite serious. The drafting paper used by this design institute was mostly imported. In 1956, the waste of drawing signatures and excessively large paper sizes alone wasted 4,000 yuan. Now, after strictly practicing economy, office expenses have been reduced by half compared with the past.

Excessive demands in life have also been fundamentally reversed after accounting and comparison. Most of the proposals put forward at the employee representative conference in November last year were about living issues.

Among them, some proposals requested the construction of skating rinks, science and culture palaces, etc. Now, after the employees' own discussions and criticisms, these excessive demands have been automatically withdrawn. In the past, the housing problem that was being clamored about, according to housing standards, those who lived in more houses voluntarily gave up the extra houses, solving the problem of insufficient housing for some employees. The Second Design Office originally required subsidies for one-third of the people. After careful calculation and rational arrangement of family life, the salaries of most people were sufficient for expenses, and now very few people are asking for public subsidies. People who were complaining about wage treatment, after accounting and comparison, deeply felt that the increase in wages in recent years has been very rapid. For example, last year, the highest wage increase among technical personnel reached 60% to 70%, and the average also reached 30% to 40%, while last year's labor productivity only increased by 25% to 30%. Many employees reflected that if they do not work hard, they will be too sorry for the country.

### 经过算账对比树立朴素风气  中南工业建筑设计院职工自觉地批判过高要求

    经过算账对比树立朴素风气
    中南工业建筑设计院职工自觉地批判过高要求
    新华社武汉25日电　中南工业建筑设计院在增产节约运动中采取算账对比的方法对职工群众进行政治思想工作，获得良好的效果。
    去年12月初，这个设计院在传达和学习了党的八届二中全会的精神以后，即根据本部门情况，开展算四笔账的工作，即：算工程设计上的浪费账，行政管理上的浪费账，工资提高跟生产提高对比账和个人生活安排账，住房是否够用账。他们算账的方法，是先选择典型，分组算细账，然后选择几个有代表性的人和事，向全体同志进行报告，启发大家开展讨论和自我批评。通过深入的算账和回忆对比，使大家普遍提高了认识，并且逐渐树立起增产节约和艰苦朴素的风气。
    在设计工作上，技术人员提出了大量的增产节约的建议，院领导方面已经根据大家的建议订出增产节约方案和相应的措施。在保证质量的前提下，各设计室最近对三十多项设计工程进行了修改，共节约资金五十一万元，钢材九百八十多吨，水泥一千八百吨。
    经过算行政管理费用的浪费，发现浪费相当严重。这个设计院所用的绘图纸，多是进口货，1956年仅图签浪费和图纸幅度过大两项就浪费了四千元。现在他们厉行节约以后，办公费用比过去减少一半。
    生活上的过高要求，在算账对比以后也得到基本扭转。去年11月的职工代表大会所提出的提案，绝大部分是关于生活问题的。
    其中有的提案要求修溜冰场、盖科学文化宫等。现在，经过职工自己的讨论和批判，这些过高的要求都自动撤消了。过去吵嚷着的房子问题，按照住房标准，多住房子的人自动让出了多住的房子，解决了部分职工住房不足的问题。第二设计室原来要求补助的人达三分之一，经过精打细算，合理安排家庭生活，绝大多数人的薪金都够支出，现在很少有人要求公家补助了。闹工资待遇的人，经过算账对比以后，深感几年来工资的增长是很快的。如去年技术人员中工资增长最高的达60％到70％，一般的也达到30％到40％，而去年劳动生产率只提高不过25％到30％。许多职工反映说：如果再不好好工作就太对不起国家了。
