    Acquisition Personnel Busy Everywhere in Wind and Snow
    Acquisition personnel from the Shaanxi Provincial State-Owned Food Company are braving hardships and venturing deep into the mountainous areas of southern and northern Shaanxi to procure pigs, cattle, and sheep, supplying the people of Beijing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and other cities with food to celebrate the Spring Festival.
    The number of food company acquisition personnel sent to the countryside in more than seventy counties across the province has more than doubled since the beginning of winter. Acquisition points have been added in remote mountainous areas such as Huanglong, Linyou, the Qinling Mountains, and the Daba Mountains. The footprints of the acquisition personnel can be found everywhere, from desert grasslands to mountainous areas and pastures. Wang Ruyi and Wang Fengming of the Shenmu County Food Company, Li Wenzhong of the Anse County Food Company, and many other acquisition personnel, undaunted by wind, snow, and severe cold, travel hundreds of miles back and forth in pastoral areas and forests, completing their acquisition tasks very well. Li Bingnan, a model escort from the Danfeng Food Management Office, crossed the icy cold Dan River nineteen times on December 25th of last year to transport live pigs across the river. Twenty-five escorts and feeders from the food companies in Yan'an, Luochuan, Huanglong, and other places worked continuously for three days and three nights at the end of last year to ensure that more than 500 live pigs concentrated in Luochuan were transported to Tongchuan on time for external transport. Wang Yuxian of the Luonan County Food Company drove pigs during the day and busied himself making shoes for the pigs at night so that their hooves would not be broken when walking on mountain roads. Many escorts often pass through areas with heavy mountains, treacherous waters, and few people. In addition to carrying their own dry food, pots, and bowls, they also have to pull grass along the way to prepare food for the livestock and often spend the night in the open.

    Commercial Administrative Cadres Work in Retail Stores, Financial and Trade Department Heads Go Deep into the Market
    Before the Spring Festival, the Tianjin Commercial Department transferred more than 3,000 administrative management cadres to retail stores to help sell New Year's goods. Most of the responsible cadres of the finance and trade departments also went to the market to guide the supply of New Year's goods.
    After the responsible cadres of the finance and trade departments went deep into the market, they put forward suggestions for improving the supply of New Year's goods. Du Xinbo, Minister of the Finance and Trade Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, discovered in the Chongqing Road and other food markets that the labor collaboration between the sales counters was not good. Some salespersons were too busy, causing customers to wait in line for a long time, while other salespersons were very idle. He immediately pointed this out and made improvements. Hu Yunchang and Guo Fengmin, deputy directors of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee Finance, Grain and Trade Office, discovered after arriving at the Gu Yi Street and other markets that some state-owned wholesale organizations had distributed too much brown sugar and some popular fruits to small vendors and too little to state-owned and joint public-private stores. Some small vendors took the opportunity to raise prices and disrupt the market. They notified the relevant departments to correct this in a timely manner.

    People in Disaster Areas Can Also Have a Happy Holiday
    Jiangsu Province has transported a large amount of grain, coal, and other materials to the disaster areas to help the people in the disaster areas have a good Spring Festival. More than 2.6 billion jin of grain alone have been transported to the disaster areas, which can supply the people in the disaster areas until March. The grain departments in some severely affected areas with inconvenient transportation have already stored three to six months of grain.
    Many measures taken by the state since the beginning of winter have improved the situation of the people in the disaster areas before the Spring Festival. 910,000 sets of winter clothing have been distributed to disaster victims. More than 1.7 million houses that were blown down or damaged by typhoons have generally been rebuilt or repaired. The provincial people's committee has allocated more than 33 million yuan in relief funds since the beginning of winter and has also vigorously supported disaster victims by using work relief, issuing sideline loans, and prepaying production deposits. Since mid-January, leadership organs at all levels have also sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to re-examine the material reserves, production, and living conditions of disaster victims. Cadres from Taixian, Jingjiang, and other counties brought cash with them when they went to the countryside, visiting the homes of disaster victims and solving problems while visiting. Since mid-January, Binhai County has sent three batches of cadres to the countryside, visiting more than 600 agricultural cooperatives, helping more than 14,000 households and more than 62,000 disaster victims replenish grain and firewood in preparation for the festival. Some disaster-stricken areas have also specially sent pork, vermicelli, and pocket money to the "five guarantees" households for the festival. Therefore, the people in the disaster areas are now in a stable mood and are continuing to carry out winter production. Disaster victims in Huaian County said: Before liberation, in times of famine, landlords forced debts during the New Year, causing families to be separated and destroyed. This year, in times of famine, the Communist Party sends grain during the New Year, and every family is reunited, and the land is not barren. Disaster victims in the Sunji Township Military Dependents Agricultural Cooperative in Baoying County shed tears of gratitude to the Party for its meticulous care for the people when they saw people sent by the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China to express their condolences.

    Transport Northern Products to the South
    Send Beltfish from the Sea to the Mountains
    At the end of last year, the non-staple food supply stations in twelve counties including Yueqing and Wenling in the Wenzhou Special Zone of Zhejiang Province successively sent more than 40 purchasers to Shandong, Shaanxi, and other provinces to purchase about 1 million jin of non-staple foods. In areas where the pig purchase task has been completed, the food company also sent people to help farmers slaughter pigs and let farmers divide the meat on the spot. According to incomplete statistics from the Yongjia County Food Company, they helped farmers slaughter and divide more than 8,000 pigs.
    In order to allow farmers in the mountainous areas of Longquan, Lishui, Qingyuan, and other places to eat fish, the staff of the Wenzhou Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company tirelessly trudged on the roads and have now transported more than 60,000 jin of beltfish to the mountainous areas.

    Surveyed Farmers' Needs Before the Festival
    In order to understand and try to meet the farmers' needs for non-staple foods during the Spring Festival, the district cooperatives under the Boxing County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shandong Province sent some staff to the countryside to investigate farmers' needs long ago. According to the survey, in addition to the 194,000 jin of meat that can be produced from the fat pigs, residual cattle, and vegetable sheep slaughtered by each agricultural cooperative, the supply and marketing cooperative specially purchased more than 100,000 jin of meat from other places, so that each resident in the county can eat an average of 12 liang of meat during the Spring Festival. They also purchased 380,000 jin of scallions, 200,000 jin of cabbage, 80,000 jin of jujubes, and more than 70,000 jin of fresh and salted fish, ready to supply farmers. (Zhong)

    为了大家欢乐地过春节
    收购人员在风雪中到处奔忙
    陕西省国营食品公司的收购人员，不避艰苦，深入陕南和陕北的山区收购猪、牛、羊，供应北京、西安、广州等城市人民欢度春节食用。
    全省七十多个县食品公司下乡的收购人员，入冬以来比平时增加了一倍多，在黄龙、麟游、秦岭以及大巴山等边远山区都增设了收购点。收购人员的足迹遍及沙漠草原、山区和牧场。神木县食品公司王如意、王凤鸣和安塞县食品公司李文忠等许多收购员，不畏风雪严寒，在牧区山林间往返数百里，很好地完成了收购任务。丹凤食品经营处模范押运员李炳南，去年12月25日在刺骨的丹江寒水中往返十九次，拉运生猪过江。延安、洛川、黄龙等地食品公司的二十五个押运员和饲养员，为了使集中在洛川的五百多头生猪按时运到铜川然后外运，在去年年底连续三天三夜没有休息。雒南县食品公司的王玉贤白天赶猪，晚上还忙着给猪做鞋子，使猪在山路上行走不会碰破蹄子。许多押运员经常经过重山恶水、人迹罕到的地区，除背着自己干粮和锅碗以外，还得边走边拔草，给牲畜准备食料，并且常常露天过夜。

    商业行政干部到零售店工作  财贸部门负责干部深入市场
    春节前，天津市商业部门抽调了三千多名行政管理干部到零售店帮助售卖年货。财经贸易部门的大部分负责干部也到市场去指导年货的供应工作。
    财经贸易部门的负责干部深入市场以后，对年货供应工作提出了改进意见。中共天津市委财贸部部长杜新波，在重庆道等菜市发现各售货柜之间劳动协作不好，有些售货员忙不过来，使得顾客排队久等，而另一些售货员就很清闲，他立即指出，作了改进。天津市人民委员会财粮贸办公室副主任胡运昌、郭丰民到了估衣街等市场后，发现有些国营批发机构把红糖和一些供不应求的水果，分配给小商贩太多，分配给国营及公私合营商店太少，有些小商贩因此乘机抬价，扰乱市场，他们就通知有关部门及时纠正。

    灾区人民也能愉快地过节
    江苏省已经把大量粮、煤等物资运到灾区，帮助灾区人民过好春节。仅运到灾区的粮食就有二十六亿多斤，可以供应灾区人民吃到3月份。部分交通不便的重灾区的粮食部门已经积储了三个月到六个月的粮食。
    国家在入冬以来采取的许多措施，使灾区人民在春节前改善了境况。九十一万套寒衣已经发到灾民手里。被台风吹倒吹破的一百七十多万间房屋，一般都已改建或修建好。省人民委员会入冬以来拨出的救济款项已经有三千三百多万元，并且还用以工代赈、发放副业贷款、预付生产订金等方法大力支持灾民。从1月中旬以来，各级领导机关还派出大批干部下乡，再一次检查了灾区物资储备、生产和灾民生活等情况。泰县、靖江等县下乡的干部随身携带现款，到灾民家中边访问边解决问题。滨海县1月中旬以来有三批干部下乡，访问了六百多个农业社，帮助一万四千多户、六万二千多个灾民补充了粮食和烧柴准备过节。有些受灾地区还给“五保”户专门送了过节的猪肉、粉丝和零用钱。因此，现在灾区人民情绪稳定，正在继续开展冬季生产。淮安县的灾民说：解放前灾荒，过年时地主逼债，弄得妻离子散、家破人亡，今年灾荒，过年时共产党送粮，家家团圆，土地不荒。宝应县孙集乡军属农业社灾民见到中共扬州地委派人去慰问时，很多人流着眼泪感谢党对人民无微不至的关怀。

    把北方的产品运往南方
    把海里的带鱼送到山区
    浙江温州专区乐清、温岭等十二个县的副食品供应站，在去年年底先后派出四十多个采购员，分赴山东、陕西等省采购了一百万斤左右的副食品。在完成生猪派购任务的地区，食品公司还派人帮助农民宰杀生猪，就地让农民分食。根据永嘉县食品公司不完全统计，他们帮助农民宰杀分食的生猪就有八千多头。
    为了使龙泉、丽水、庆元等地山区的农民也能吃到鱼，温州水产供销公司的工作人员，不倦地在公路上跋涉，现在已把六万多斤带鱼运到山区。　　（江）
    过节前调查了农民的需要
    为了了解和尽量满足农民春节副食品需要，山东省博兴县供销社所属各区社，早就派了一些工作人员深入农村调查农民需要。根据调查计算，除各农业社自宰的肥猪、残牛和菜羊共可出肉十九万四千多斤外，供销社还特地从外地购买了十万多斤肉，使全县居民在春节时每人平均可以吃肉十二两。他们还采购了三十八万斤大葱、二十万斤白菜、八万斤小枣，鲜、咸鱼等七万多斤，准备供应农民。　（众）
