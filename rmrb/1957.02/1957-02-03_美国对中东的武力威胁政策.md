U.S. Policy of Military Threat Towards the Middle East
		Feng Zhidan
    Some time ago, the American ruling clique was still putting on airs in front of the Middle Eastern people, disguising itself as a maintainer of Middle Eastern peace and an opponent of colonialism. But in no time, the American colonialists revealed their true colors, formulating a plan to invade the Middle East called the "Eisenhower Doctrine," based on military threats.

    Although the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has glittering gold coins hanging on its big stick, this can never conceal its vicious aggressive nature. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly admitted that the purpose of "U.S. money" is to establish "loyal security forces" in Middle Eastern countries for the benefit of American aggression, in order to interfere in the affairs of these countries. The people of the Middle East see the aggressive essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" very clearly. As the Damascus "Al-Nour" pointed out: The "Eisenhower Doctrine" "should be regarded as a threat of a new armed invasion of the region, the purpose of which is to enslave the people of the region and plunder their wealth."

    Of course, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is nothing new. Colonialists have always used fire and sword as their main tools for enslaving and ruling other countries and for colonial expansion. This is how the old Western colonial powers treated the people of the Middle East in the past hundred years; and this is how the new American colonialists have treated the people of the Middle East in the eleven years since the war. The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is merely a continuation of the policy of military threat that the United States has long implemented in the Middle East.

    Since the United States further invaded the Middle East after the war, it has established military bases on the land of many Middle Eastern countries. In Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, Bahrain, Aden, and in North Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya... American military bases are everywhere. Especially Turkey, since it accepted American "military assistance" under the "Truman Doctrine" in 1947, almost the entire country has become an American military base. In Adana, Dalaburg, Yesilkoy (near Istanbul), Esenboga (near Ankara), Konya, Eskisehir, Diyarbakir, Gazimir, Malatya, Bandirma, Batman, Merzifon, Izmir, Erzurum, Balikesir, Elazig, Merzifon and other places, air force bases that were not needed at all by the Turkish Air Force were built and expanded under the direct supervision of the American military. The largest of these is the Adana Air Force Base. According to the August 13, 1954 issue of "U.S. News & World Report," Adana has become the largest bomber base in the Middle East, with a runway of 14,000 feet long, which can be used by the largest bombers. There, the United States also built three giant aircraft hangars, factories, and barracks for three bomber squadrons. In Iran, in 1950, the United States used "military assistance" to obtain fourteen air force bases, two seaports, and a thirty-year lease on the Iranian railway. Obviously, the U.S. bases in the Middle East have nothing in common with the vital interests of the Middle Eastern countries. U.S. newspapers have repeatedly and publicly admitted that these bases (including long-range bomber bases) are intended to threaten the peace and security of the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democracies, threaten the peace and security of the Middle Eastern countries, and guarantee the United States' oil interests in the Middle East. The U.S. military bases in the Middle East, like its military bases in other parts of the world, are actually "states within states," and its violation of the territorial sovereignty of the countries in which they are located is obvious.

    Since the war, U.S. imperialism has planned military aggression groups in the Middle East, trying to split the unity of Middle Eastern countries and Arab countries, and create tension in the Middle East. In 1951, the United States attempted to organize a military aggression group called the "Middle East Command," but it went bankrupt due to the strong opposition of the Middle Eastern countries. In February 1952, the United States first dragged Turkey into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In 1955, the United States and Britain jointly planned the Baghdad Pact organization. Britain directly participated in this military aggression group, while the United States "joined the alliance through the back door"; the United States participated in the "Economic Committee" and "Anti-Subversion Committee" of this military aggression group, and sent a permanent military liaison office to the Baghdad Pact organization. The U.S. and British imperialists used this aggressive group to create division and opposition in the Middle East and carry out sinful subversive activities and military threats against Arab countries. Not long ago, the Syrian government uncovered a subversive conspiracy case, which clearly shows that the Baghdad Pact organization is the center of the imperialist conspiracy to threaten the independence and sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries. Now, due to the failure of the Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt, its prestige has been swept away, and the Baghdad Pact organization is on the verge of disintegration. The United States is taking the opportunity to further replace Britain and directly control the organization, making it a tool for the United States to carry out colonial expansion in the Middle East.

    Under the impetus of the military group policies of the United States and Britain, some Middle Eastern countries have been forced to maintain huge military budgets and armed forces. Turkey has a population of only over 20 million, but it maintains an army of more than 500,000, with more than 50% of the national budget used for military expenditures. Israel has a population of less than two million, but it has an armed force of over 200,000. Under the pretext of so-called "balance of power," the United States supplies large amounts of military weapons to Turkey, Iraq, Israel, and other countries, provoking discord among Middle Eastern countries and creating the Arab-Israeli conflict, which has caused continuous wars and unrest in the Middle East for a long time.

    The U.S. Sixth Fleet, which has been stationed in the eastern Mediterranean for a long time, is a constant threat to the peace of the Middle East and the national independence and sovereignty of all countries. The U.S. Sixth Fleet includes two aircraft carriers, dozens of ships of various types, and 25,000 officers and soldiers. It often patrols and conducts exercises between many bases and seaports along the Mediterranean coast, flaunting its military power to Middle Eastern countries and intimidating the people of Middle Eastern countries. When Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the United States, together with Britain and France, used their "naval strength" in the Mediterranean as a backing for negotiations with the Egyptian government. U.S. military authorities have claimed that the Sixth Fleet will be "able to be reinforced quickly" "if any emergency in the Suez Canal area requires it." This is obviously a military threat to Egypt. According to the Associated Press, a few months ago, the United States "had already begun to increase the number of warships in the Sixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean and strengthen its firepower." There are reports that during the Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt, the U.S. Sixth Fleet was stationed in the sea west of Syria to contain the support of other Arab countries for Egypt.

    These facts show that the United States has always been a great enemy of the independence and freedom of Middle Eastern countries, and it has always been threatening Middle Eastern peace with military force. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a more blatant and frenzied manifestation of American colonialism in the Middle East. The United States is stepping up its aggression in the Middle East because the victory of the Egyptian people in resisting the war of aggression has severely hit the world colonial system and greatly encouraged the liberation movements of Middle Eastern countries and oppressed nations around the world. Faced with the great wave of anti-colonialist movements of the Middle Eastern people, the United States, as the number one colonial country, cannot but be panic-stricken. Therefore, after the retreat of British and French colonial forces in the Middle East, the United States could not wait to wave the big stick,妄想吓唬Middle Eastern people, suppress their national independence aspirations, and dominate the Middle East.

    However, the heroic people of the Middle East cannot be intimidated. As soon as the "Eisenhower Doctrine" came out, it was met with resolute opposition from the people of the Middle East, the people of Asia and Africa, and all peace-loving people around the world. No matter how cunningly the "Eisenhower Doctrine" appears, it is destined to fail.

    美国对中东的武力威胁政策	冯之丹
    前些时候，美国统治集团还在中东人民面前装腔作势，把自己打扮成中东和平的维护者和殖民主义的反对者。可是，曾几何时，美国殖民主义者就露出了真面目，制订了以武力威胁为基础的叫做“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略中东计划。
    尽管“艾森豪威尔主义”在它的大棒上面挂了闪闪发光的金元，但这绝不能掩盖住它的凶恶的侵略本质。美国国务卿杜勒斯公开承认，“美国出钱”的目的，就是要在中东各国建立起对美国侵略利益的“忠心耿耿的保安部队”，以便干涉这些国家的事务。对于“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略实质，中东人民是看得很清楚的。正如大马士革的“光明报”所指出的：“艾森豪威尔主义”“应该认为是一种对这个地区的新的武装入侵的威胁，它的目的是要奴役这个地区的人民和掠夺他们的财富。”
    当然，“艾森豪威尔主义”并不是什么新东西。殖民主义者从来都是用火和剑作为它们向别的国家进行奴役统治和殖民扩张的主要工具。过去一百多年来，西方的老牌殖民国家对于中东人民是这样；战后十一年间，美国新殖民主义者对于中东人民也是这样。所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，只是美国对中东地区早已实行的武力威胁政策的继续。
    战后美国进一步侵入中东地区以来，它在许多中东国家的土地上已经建立了军事基地。在土耳其、伊朗、伊拉克、以色列、沙特阿拉伯、塞浦路斯、巴林群岛、亚丁以及北非的摩洛哥、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、利比亚……到处都有着美国的军事基地。特别是土耳其，自从1947年根据“杜鲁门主义”接受了美国的“军事援助”以后，几乎整个国土都变成了美国的军事基地。在亚达那、达拉布格、耶西尔科伊（靠近伊斯坦布尔）、爱森堡加（靠近安卡拉）、科尼亚、厄斯基色尔、狄雅倍基尔、加齐米尔、马拉底亚、班提尔马、巴特门、默泽逢、伊斯密尔、埃尔斯伦、巴利开息尔、艾略西兹、梅尔齐芳等地方，由美国军方直接监督修建和扩建了根本为土耳其空军所不需要的空军基地。其中最大的是亚达那空军基地。据1954年8月13日的“美国新闻与世界报道”说，亚达那已成为中东最大的轰炸机基地，机场的跑道长一万四千呎，能供最大的轰炸机使用。在那里，美国还建立了三个巨型飞机库、工厂和可供三个轰炸机队住宿的兵营。在伊朗，1950年美国就利用“军事援助”获得了十四个空军基地、两个海港和伊朗铁路的三十年租借权。显然，美国在中东的基地同中东各国的切身利益毫无共同之处，美国报刊曾许多次公开地承认，这些基地（包括长距离轰炸机基地）都是为了威胁苏联和东欧人民民主国家的和平和安全，威胁中东国家的和平和安全，保证美国在中东的石油利益。美国在中东的军事基地像它在世界上其他地区的军事基地一样，实际上都是“国中之国”，它对所在国家领土主权的侵犯是一目了然的。
    战后以来，美帝国主义在中东策划了军事侵略集团，力图分裂中东国家和阿拉伯各国的团结，制造中东紧张局势。1951年，美国企图组织“中东司令部”的军事侵略集团，只是由于中东各国的强烈反对才宣告破产。1952年2月，美国首先把土耳其拖入了北大西洋公约集团。1955年，美国和英国共同策划了巴格达条约组织。英国直接参加了这个军事侵略集团，而美国是从“后门加入联盟”；美国参加了这个军事侵略集团的“经济委员会”、“反颠复委员会”，并且派有一个常驻巴格达条约组织的军事联络处。美英帝国主义利用这个侵略集团，在中东地区制造分裂和对立，向阿拉伯国家进行罪恶的颠复活动和武力威胁。不久以前，叙利亚政府破获了一个颠复阴谋案件，就清楚地说明了巴格达条约组织是帝国主义威胁中东国家独立主权的阴谋中心，现在，由于英法侵略埃及战争失败，威信扫地，巴格达条约组织濒于瓦解，美国正乘机进一步替代英国直接控制这个组织，使之成为美国在中东进行殖民扩张的工具。
    在美英军事集团政策的鞭策下，有些中东国家被迫维持着庞大的军事预算和武装部队。土耳其全国才二千多万人口，而却维持着五十多万军队，50％以上的国家预算用作军事开支。以色列人口不到二百万，却拥有二十几万武装部队。美国在所谓“实力均衡”的借口下，以大量军火武器供给土耳其、伊拉克和以色列等国，挑拨中东国家间的不和，并制造了以阿纷争，使中东地区兵连祸结，长期不得安宁。
    美国第六舰队长期驻扎东地中海，是对中东和平和各国民族独立主权的经常威胁。美国第六舰队包括两艘航空母舰、数十艘各种类型的舰艇和二万五千名官兵。它经常在地中海沿岸的许多基地和海港之间进行巡逻和演习，向中东国家炫耀武力，恫吓中东国家人民。在埃及宣布苏伊士运河公司国有化的时候，美国就同英法一道以它们在地中海的“海军实力”作为同埃及政府进行谈判的后盾。美国军事当局扬言，“如果苏伊士运河区的任何紧急事件需要的话”，第六舰队将“能够很快地得到增援”。这显然是对埃及进行武力威胁。据美联社透露，几个月以前，美国“就已经开始增加驻地中海的第六舰队的军舰数目以及加强它的火力。”有消息说：在英法侵略埃及战争期间，美国第六舰队就驻扎在叙利亚以西的海中，以牵制其他阿拉伯国家对埃及的支援。
    这些事实说明，美国从来就是中东各国独立和自由的大敌，它一直是在以武力威胁中东和平。“艾森豪威尔主义”是美国殖民主义在中东地区的更加露骨和疯狂的表现。美国加紧侵略中东，是因为埃及人民反抗侵略战争的胜利，沉重地打击了世界殖民主义体系，大大地鼓舞了中东各国和全世界被压迫民族的解放运动。面对着中东人民反殖民主义运动的巨大浪潮，作为头号殖民国家的美国不能不惊恐万状，于是，在英法殖民势力在中东败退以后，美国便迫不及待地挥舞起大棒，妄想吓唬中东人民，压抑他们的民族独立愿望，独霸中东。
    但是，英勇的中东人民是吓不倒的。“艾森豪威尔主义”刚一出笼，便遭到了中东人民、亚非人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的坚决反对。不论“艾森豪威尔主义”用多么狡猾的形式出现，它是注定要失败的。
