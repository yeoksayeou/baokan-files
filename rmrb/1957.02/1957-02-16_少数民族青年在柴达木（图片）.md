Minority Youth in Qaidam

In the Qaidam Basin, whether in the field or indoors, in exploration teams or among hospital staff, there are young people from minority ethnic groups. To build our beloved motherland, they unite well with Han workers, helping each other in their work and caring for each other in their lives.

    少数民族青年在柴达木
    在柴达木盆地，不论在野外或室内，勘探队里或医院工作人员中，都有少数民族的青年。为了建设可爱的祖国，他们和汉族职工团结得很好，在工作上互相帮助；生活上彼此关心。
