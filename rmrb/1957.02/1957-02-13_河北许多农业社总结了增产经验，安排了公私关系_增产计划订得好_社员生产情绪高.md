Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 10th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Hua reports: Many agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province are leading their members in formulating this year's agricultural production increase plans, mobilizing the production enthusiasm of their members to improve current production, and preparing for a bumper harvest this year.

Currently, in the Xingtai Special District, 446 cooperatives in 14 counties including Neiqiu and Nangong have formulated production increase plans. In addition, more than 1,300 cooperatives' production increase plans are being discussed and formulated. In Handan Special District, 51 key cooperatives in various counties have also finalized their agricultural production increase plans. In Gaoyang County, Baoding Special District, the draft agricultural production increase plans of more than 100 agricultural cooperatives have been launched for discussion among the members and are now being further revised with reference to the reference indicators allocated by the state.

Many agricultural production cooperatives, when formulating agricultural production increase plans, lead their members in summarizing experiences and tapping potential, further encouraging the members' enthusiasm for increasing production. When discussing production plans, members of the Guoguang Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Suning County, decided, based on last year's production increase experience, to increase the planting of 340 mu of high-yield crops, sink six eye-well water wells, expand the irrigated area by more than 100 mu, reclaim 150 mu of wasteland on the city slopes, and increase the summer planting area. The per-unit-area yield of grain and cotton for the whole cooperative can be further increased by 6% and 4% respectively, on the basis of a bumper harvest. The members calculated the amount they could potentially earn based on the total increased income of the cooperative, and their production enthusiasm was further heightened. Each production team dug more than 100 urine pits to accumulate urine fertilizer, and more than 30 old men who previously did not participate in labor also participated in collecting manure. The whole cooperative accumulated more than 10,000 cartloads of coarse fertilizer and 230,000 catties of human urine in 20 days, and fertilizer was also applied to more than 70 mu of wheat fields.

The agricultural planting plans of many agricultural cooperatives this year have been repeatedly discussed and revised by the members, and generally meet the needs of the state and the living requirements of the members. When formulating planting plans, the Wu Gong cooperative in Raoyang County, the Shuangfeng cooperative in Funing County, and the Dong Jing'an cooperative in Xingtai County, increased the planting of sorghum, millet, sesame, and various minor grains by more than 2,000 mu based on the needs of the members' lives, without affecting the increase in grain and cotton production, combining the individual requirements of the members, the needs of the state, and the collective interests of the cooperative, further stimulating the enthusiasm of the members. After the Wu Gong Township Agricultural Cooperative in Raoyang County formulated its planting plan, the members put forward more than 80 suggestions for achieving increased production and income.

With the formulation of agricultural production increase plans by agricultural production cooperatives, the cadres and members have a "bottom line" in their minds about how to produce, and the current preparatory work for farming can be carried out rapidly. Before Chongyi Agricultural Cooperative in Chongli County formulated its production increase plan, the members did not know what crops to plant on which piece of land, how much fertilizer to apply, and the manure delivery activities could not be carried out. After the democratic formulation of the production increase plan, the members knew what to do, and the ten production teams mobilized more than 130 male and female members to collectively accumulate fertilizer and mash manure, and dispatched more than 80 large carts to deliver manure in a concentrated manner according to different planting needs.

    河北许多农业社总结了增产经验，安排了公私关系
    增产计划订得好　社员生产情绪高
    新华社保定10日电　新华社记者张华报道：河北省许多农业生产合作社正领导社员制订今年的农业增产计划，调动社员的生产积极性搞好当前生产，为今年的农业大丰收作准备。
    当前，邢台专区内丘、南宫等十四县已有四百四十六个社订出了增产计划，另外有一千三百多个社的增产计划，正在讨论制订。邯郸专区各县，也有五十一个重点社订好了农业增产计划。保定专区高阳县的一百多个农业社的农业增产计划草案，已发动社员进行了讨论，现在正参照国家分配的参考指标，进一步修订。
    许多农业生产合作社在制订农业增产计划时，领导社员总结经验、挖掘潜力，进一步鼓舞了社员的增产热情。肃宁县城关乡国光社社员在讨论生产计划时，根据去年增产经验，决定增种三百四十亩高产作物，锥六眼水井，扩大一百多亩水浇地，开垦一百五十亩城坡荒地，和增加夏种面积。全社粮食、棉花的单位面积产量，即可在丰收的基础上再分别提高6％和4％。社员根据全社增加的总收入计算了自己可能多分的数目，生产热情进一步增高。各生产队挖了一百多个尿坑积尿肥，三十多个过去不参加劳动的老头也参加了拾粪，全社二十天便积出了一万多车粗肥、二十三万斤人尿，七十多亩麦田也追施了肥料。
    许多农业社今年的农业种植计划经过社员反复讨论修改，一般都符合国家需要和社员的生活要求。饶阳县五公、抚宁县双峰、邢台县东静安等三个农业社在订种植计划时，根据社员生活需要在不影响粮棉增产的原则下，增加了高粱、谷子、芝麻与各种小杂粮二千多亩，把社员个人要求、国家需要和社的集体利益结合起来，进一步启发了社员的积极性。饶阳县五公乡农业社订出种植计划后，社员们曾提出了八十多条实现增产增收的建议。
    农业生产合作社制订出农业增产计划，社干部和社员们对怎样生产心里有了“底”，当前的备耕工作便能迅速的开展起来。崇礼县崇一农业社未制订增产计划前，社员不知道那块地种什么庄稼，上多少肥料，送粪活动总是开展不起来，民主制订增产计划后，社员心里有数了，十个生产队便动员起一百三十多名男女社员集体积肥捣粪，并出动八十多辆大车，根据不同的种植需要，突击送粪。
