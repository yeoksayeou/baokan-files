The Yangtze River Shipping Administration held a forum of technical personnel in late January, which proved that there is great potential for coal conservation. The entire bureau can save more than 30,000 tons of coal in 1957.

During the forum, many practical and feasible methods for saving coal were provided. For example, in heating work, last year the Minquan Wheel, when traveling the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River without towing barges, implemented single-furnace firing, reducing coal consumption by 25.85%. If all cargo ships and tugboats on the Sichuan River that do not tow barges promote single-furnace firing when traveling the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, saving an average of 20% of coal consumption, more than 10,000 tons of coal can be saved annually. When navigating downstream on the Sichuan River, using the single-furnace separate steam method saves an average of 11% of coal, and more than 6,000 tons of coal can be saved annually. In terms of rationalizing transportation organization, such as strengthening the overall coordination of ships, ports, and cargo, implementing dedicated line transportation, organizing tugboats to travel fully loaded, and changing the triangular formation of upstream fleets on the Sichuan River to a shuttle formation; in terms of improving operational technology, conscientiously improving the segmented firing method, etc., can all reduce coal consumption.

    长江航运部门节约燃料潜力大
    本报讯　长江航运管理局在1月下旬举行了一次技术人员座谈会，证明煤炭节约潜力很大，全局在1957年可节约燃煤三万多吨。
    在座谈中，提供了不少切实可行的节约燃煤的办法。如在加热工工作方面，去年民权轮在不拖驳子行驶长江中下游的时候，实行单炉生火，减少了煤耗25.85％。如果所有川江不拖驳子的货轮和拖轮，在行驶长江中下游时推广单炉生火，平均节约煤耗20％，全年就可以节约煤炭一万多吨；在航行川江下水时，采用单炉分汽办法，平均节约燃煤11％，全年也可节约煤炭六千多吨。在合理组织运输方面，如加强船、港、货的全面配合，贯彻专线运输，组织拖轮满载航行，把川江上水船队由品字队改为梭形队；在改进操作技术方面，认真改进分段烧火法等等，都能减少燃煤消耗。
