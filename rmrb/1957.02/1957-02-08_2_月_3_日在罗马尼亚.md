    February 3rd in Romania		By our correspondent Ding Man
      February 3rd was election day for the Romanian people. On this day, warm sunshine shone on Romania, with no fog or clouds in the sky. The Dâmbovița River, which runs through Bucharest, flowed quietly towards the Danube. After most of the winter, the wild grass on both sides of the river remained oily green. Compared with previous years, this should be the coldest time in Bucharest. Such clear weather as today has been rare recently. Some people said, "Heaven is also celebrating our election." Others said, "This symbolizes the happiness of our people."
    Today, Bucharest and its citizens were dressed in festive attire. Young men and women, wearing colorful clothes, enthusiastically played music on the streets, dancing their favorite "circle dance." Beautiful Bucharest was even more charming today.
    Bucharest has 445 polling stations, and many voters arrived half an hour or an hour before the polls opened. Dumitru, a 40-year-old mechanical repair worker from the "Red Grivița" district, said, "I have never been so happy as today. I got up very early today, shaved, tidied up my clothes, and rushed to cast my vote for the most beloved Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej." To welcome the election, their factory overfulfilled the production plan for January by 2%.
    In Bucharest, we saw the people's love for their party, government, and leaders. After Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Workers' Party, and Comrade Petru Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly, and other leading comrades cast their votes at the third polling station in the "New Bucharest" district, they were cheered by crowds of people in the streets, who rushed to shake their hands. Chairman of the Council of Ministers Chivu Stoica cast his vote at the second polling station in the "Filantropia" district. The candidate here was Ye Kenomu, an advanced worker from the "Mao Zedong Factory." After Apostol and other leading comrades voted in the "Red Grivița" district, they danced folk dances with hundreds of people cheering in the streets.
    Gailde, a housewife from the "Red Grivița" district, said, "For our happiness and for the prosperity of our motherland, I voted for Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej very early." She is 58 years old this year. She said, "If he is elected as our representative, our lives will be better." At a polling station in Bucharest, at 5:30 in the morning, an old man named Vasili, a 74-year-old pensioner, was waiting at the door. He strived to be the first to vote for the candidate of the People's Democratic Front.
    Voters quickly and smoothly cast their votes at the 8,800 polling stations across the country. By about noon, some entire cities and villages had finished voting. In the newly established "Victory City," all voters completed their voting by 12:30. The voting in the 22 townships of the Hungarian Autonomous Region ended at 12:00. Voters in many villages in the Cluj Region finished voting at 9:00 in the morning. By 8:30 in the evening, 96% of the voters nationwide had cast their votes.
    According to newspaper reports, "Everywhere in the country, people are shouting: Long live the candidates of the People's Democratic Front! Long live our party, government, and beloved leaders! Everywhere people are singing and dancing happily."
    Constantin, from Iași City, brought his wife and three daughters to be among the first to vote. They are all textile workers. After voting, Constantin said, "I am not a member of the Workers' Party, but I trust the candidates of the People's Democratic Front. I will follow the path indicated by the Party."
    In Târgu Mureș City, in the Hungarian Autonomous Region, a Hungarian teacher at the Bolyai Elementary School said after voting for the candidate of the People's Democratic Front, "The Party and the government are very concerned about the education of ethnic minorities." Their school received 5 million lei from the state for construction and education expenses. He said, "This has never happened in the 400-year history of the school. To thank the government for its care, all our teachers voted for the candidate of the People's Democratic Front." At the No. 30 polling station in the Cluj City, the candidate was a Hungarian writer. The first to vote here was a Hungarian worker named Skypo, followed by Romanians and Germans. They said, "To build socialism, we must consolidate our fraternal friendship, and we must unite better."
    In Bucharest, we visited the 12th polling station in the "Vladimirescu" district, a Jewish residential area. When we went there, we saw people dancing after voting. The People's Democratic Front candidate here was the Jewish Bishop Laurențiu Moisescu. Romania has more than two million ethnic minorities. Among the candidates of the People's Democratic Front, 67 are ethnic minorities. The national average is one candidate for every 40,000 people, so the proportion of ethnic minority candidates is very large.
    On this day, the countryside was as lively as the city. We went to Jilava Township, a suburb of Bucharest with 3,500 residents. The lively scene on the streets was the same as when we celebrated the Spring Festival in the Chinese countryside. We visited the 12th polling station set up in the village. A large group of collective farm members were waiting to vote at 5:30 in the morning. The polling room was a classroom in a seven-year primary school. On the wall in the center hung a large tapestry woven by a farmer, with wild rose flowers of various colors seeming to bloom in the center of the tapestry. Above the tapestry hung the national emblem, and on both sides hung the national flag. Inside the room, on one side were seven secret ballot booths, and on the other side were several ballot tables. After receiving the ballot, if the voter did not agree with the candidate written on the ballot, he could cross it out and write the name of someone he agreed with. In the very center of the polling room was a square ballot box, and voters would put their ballots into it from the top from time to time.
    The farmers of Desugăț Village in Galați County also put on new clothes. They said, "Today is not like ordinary days." The farmers of Călărași County said that the Party had pointed out the way to build a prosperous life for them—collectivization. In order to express their love for the Party, they actively participated in the election.
    In many villages in Constanța County, farmers collectively joined agricultural co-operatives on February 3rd. An old farmer from Craiova County who had participated in the Romanian peasant uprising of 1907 gave the election committee a letter while voting at the Viaf polling station. The letter described how peasants lived and struggled under the oppression of landlords in the past. The letter said: "We don't want landlords. For a better life and to work on our own land, we vote for the candidates of the People's Democratic Front."
    It is understood that on February 3rd, more than 99% of the 11.6 million voters in Romania participated in the election, and more than 98% of them voted for the candidates of the People's Democratic Front.

    2月3日在罗马尼亚	本报记者　丁曼
      2月3日是罗马尼亚人民的大选日。这一天，温暖的阳光照耀着罗马尼亚，天空中没有雾也没有云。横贯布加勒斯特市区的顿博维察河的河水，静静地流向多瑙河。小河两岸的野草，经过了大半个冬季，依然保持着油绿色。和往年相比，现在应当是布加勒斯特最寒冷的时候。像今天这样晴朗的好天气，最近是很少见的。人们有的说：“老天爷也在庆祝我们的选举。”有的说：“这象征着我们人民的幸福。”
    今天的布加勒斯特和它的市民都穿上了节日的盛装。年轻的小伙子和姑娘们，穿着花衣服，在大街上起劲的奏着乐，跳着他们最喜爱的“圆圈舞”。美丽的布加勒斯特今天更加动人了。
    布加勒斯特有四百四十五个投票站，很多选民在开始投票前半小时或一小时就到投票站来了。“红色格里维察”选区的四十岁的机械修理工人杜米特鲁说：“我从来没有像今天这样高兴过。今天起得很早，起来以后刮了胡子，整理了服装，就赶来投了最可爱的人乔治乌—德治同志的票。”为了迎接选举，他们的工厂在1月份超额2％完成了生产计划。
    在布加勒斯特，我们看到了这里的人民对他们的党、政府和领袖的热爱。工人党第一书记乔治乌—德治和国民议会主席团主席彼·格罗查等领导同志，在“新布加勒斯特”选区第三投票站投完票后，受到了满街群众的欢呼，大家抢着和他们握手。部长会议主席斯托伊卡在“非林塔尔”选区第二投票站投了票。这里的候选人是“毛泽东工厂”的先进工人叶可诺木。阿波斯托尔等领导同志在“红色格里维察”选区投票后，同在大街上欢呼的数百人一起跳了民间舞。
    “红色格里维察”选区的家庭主妇盖尔德说：“为了我们的幸福，为了我们祖国的繁荣，我很早就投了乔治乌—德治同志的票。”她今年五十八岁了。她说：“选他作我们的代表，我们的日子就会过得更好。”在布加勒斯特的一个选举站，在早晨五点半钟，就有一位领取养老金的七十四岁的老人华西里等在门前，他争取到了第一个投票选举人民民主阵线的候选人。
    选民们迅速和顺利地在全国八千八百个投票站进行投票。到正午十二点钟左右，有的整个城市和乡村都投完了票。在新建立的“胜利城”，全体选民的投票工作在十二点半钟就结束了。匈牙利族自治州的二十二个乡的投票是在十二点钟结束的。克罗什州的很多村庄的选民在早晨九点钟就投完了票。到晚八点半钟时，全国已有96％的选民投了票。
    此间报纸消息说：“全国到处都在高呼：人民民主阵线的候选人万岁！我们的党、政府和敬爱的领袖万岁！到处人们都在高兴地唱啊，跳啊。”
    雅西城的康斯坦基带着妻子和三个女儿第一批投了票。他们都是纺织工人。康斯坦基投票以后说：“我不是工人党党员，但是我信任人民民主阵线的候选人，我要按党指示的道路走。”
    在匈牙利族自治州的塔尔古谟勒斯城，波良依小学的一位匈牙利族教员在投了人民民主阵线候选人的票后说：“党和政府非常关心少数民族的学习。”他们学校得到国家拨给的五百万列依的建设和教育费。他说：“这是这个学校建校四百年来从来没有过的事情。为了感谢政府的关怀，我们教员都投了人民民主阵线候选人的票。”在克罗什城第三十号投票站，候选人是匈牙利族的一位作家。这里第一个投票的是匈牙利族的工人斯盖波，接着是罗马尼亚族人、日尔曼族人投了票。他们说：“为了建设社会主义，我们要巩固兄弟般的友谊，我们要更好地团结起来”。
    在布加勒斯特我们曾经到犹太族居住区“弗拉基米列斯库”选区第十二投票站参观，我们去时看到投完票的人正在跳舞。这里的人民民主阵线候选人是犹太主教劳仁莫日斯。罗马尼亚的少数民族共有二百多万人。在人民民主阵线的候选人中，有六十七个是少数民族。全国平均每四万人一个候选人，因此，少数民族候选人占的比重是很大的。
    这一天，乡村也像城市一样热闹。我们到了布加勒斯特郊区的一个有三千五百个居民的日拉娃乡，大街上的热闹情景同我们中国的农村过春节时一样。我们访问了设在该村的第十二投票站。一大批集体农庄庄员在早晨五点半钟时就在等着投票。投票室是一个七年制小学的教室，正中墙壁上挂着一个农民自织的大壁毯，各种色彩的野蔷薇花，像是正在壁毯的中央怒放。壁毯的上边挂着国徽，两旁挂着国旗。室内一边是七个秘密写票室，另一边排列着几张选票桌。选民领到选票后，如不同意票上写着的那个候选人，可以划掉另写上一个他所同意的人的名字。投票室正中间放着一个四方形的票箱，选民们不时把票从上口投进去。
    加拉茨州德苏盖茨村的农民们也穿上了新衣服，他们说：“今天不比往日。”卡特曼茨区的农民们说，党给他们指出了建立富裕生活的路——集体化，为了对党表示热爱，他们积极参加选举。
    康斯坦萨州很多村庄的农民，在2月3日集体参加了共耕社。克拉约伐州的一位参加过罗马尼亚1907年农民起义的老农民，在维阿夫投票站投票的同时给了选举委员会一封信，信上写着过去农民在地主压迫下如何生活和斗争。信上说：“我们不要地主。为了更好的生活，为了在自己的田地上劳动，我们投人民民主阵线候选人的票。”
    据了解，2月3日这一天，罗马尼亚的一千一百六十万以上的选民，有99％以上都参加了选举，其中有98％以上的人投了人民民主阵线候选人的票。
