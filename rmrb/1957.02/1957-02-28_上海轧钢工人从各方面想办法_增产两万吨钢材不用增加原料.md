Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 27th. The Shanghai Iron and Steel Industry Department held a steel rolling production increase and economy meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, and determined to adopt measures in eight aspects to save raw materials and increase steel production. According to calculations, after these measures are fully implemented, more than 20,000 tons of steel can be produced annually without increasing steel rolling raw materials.

At the meeting, the Xinhu Steel Plant introduced their experience in promoting "negative tolerance rolling." This is the most important measure that Shanghai's steel rolling plants plan to universally promote. In the past, the steel produced by various factories was larger than the usage requirements of steel using units, wasting a lot of raw materials; the widespread adoption of the "negative tolerance rolling" method allows the rolled steel to be as close as possible to the usage requirements, and more than 10,000 tons of steel can be produced annually.

Various steel rolling plants will also take further measures in steel heating, rolling, and cooling to reduce losses. The reduction in losses from the implementation of the "rapid cooling" method alone can increase steel production by three to four thousand tons per year.

In addition, Shanghai's steel rolling factories are also preparing to use scrap materials such as waste railway steel rails and stagnant materials to roll steel in order to make up for the shortage of steel rolling raw materials. At present, the utilization of some waste materials is being researched, and some have been successfully trial-rolled.

    上海轧钢工人从各方面想办法
    增产两万吨钢材不用增加原料
    新华社上海27日电　上海钢铁工业部门在26日下午举行轧钢增产节约大会，确定从八个方面采取措施来节约原料增产钢材。据计算，这些措施全面执行以后，不用增加轧钢原料，一年就可以增产两万多吨钢材。
    大会上，新沪钢铁厂介绍了他们推行“负公差轧制”的经验。这是上海各轧钢厂打算普遍推广的最重要的措施。过去，各厂轧制出的钢材都大于钢材使用单位的使用要求，浪费了许多原料；普遍采用“负公差轧制”的办法，使轧制出的钢材尽量接近使用要求，一年就可以增产一万多吨钢材。
    各个轧钢厂还将从钢料的加热、轧制、冷却等方面进一步采取措施，来减少损耗。单是推行“快速冷却”的办法所减少的损耗，一年也可以增产三、四千吨钢材。
    此外，上海的轧钢工厂还准备利用废旧的铁路钢轨等废料、滞料、来轧制钢材，以弥补轧钢原料的不足。目前，有的废料滞料的利用正在进行研究，有的已经试轧成功。
