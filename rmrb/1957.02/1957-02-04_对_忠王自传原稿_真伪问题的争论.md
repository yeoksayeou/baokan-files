Debate on the Authenticity of the "Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang's Autobiography"

Recently, the historical community has seen renewed debate regarding the authenticity of the confession of Li Xiucheng, the Loyal King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

The debate began with the publication of an article by Nian Zimin and Shu Shicheng in the fourth issue of the 1956 "Journal of East China Normal University," titled "Discussion on the Authenticity of the 'Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang's Autobiography'," which questioned the authenticity of the "Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang's Autobiography" as determined by Luo Ergang. Nian Zimin believes that the "Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang's Autobiography" was forged by Zeng Guofan. His main reason is that the handwriting of the "Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang's Autobiography" and another "Autograph Answers" does not match the handwriting of another surviving piece, "Zhong Wang's Edict to Li Zhaoshou in Handwriting." He believes that "Zhong Wang's Edict to Li Zhaoshou in Handwriting" is the only surviving piece of Zhong Wang's handwriting, and the "Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang's Autobiography" is fake (see the Academic Trends section of this newspaper on November 19, 1956).

Nian Zimin's argument was opposed by Jing Heng and Jin Yufu.

Jing Heng, in his article "Discussion on the Authenticity of Li Xiucheng's Autobiography" (published in the 98th issue of the "Guangming Daily" History Bi-Weekly), believes that from the perspective of comparing and examining the two documents with different handwriting, "Edict to Li Zhaoshou" and "Original Manuscript", the "Original Manuscript" is more likely to be a reliable autograph. Because the content of "Edict to Li Zhaoshou" was a type of official document system of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom at that time, not a private letter. The words and phrases are also a type of writing style commonly used by "scribes" in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom at that time. Not only is the calligraphy neat and experienced, but the diction is also neat and concise. Considering Zhong Wang's background and the arduous military revolutionary process, he would not have reached such a level of culture in such a short period of time. Official documents of this kind would not be drafted by staff and copied by Zhong Wang. On the contrary, the content, vocabulary, and calligraphy of the autobiography "Original Manuscript" are very consistent with Zhong Wang's situation. He believes that Nian Zimin's textual research, on the contrary, strengthens the authenticity of the "Original Manuscript," because it proves that the handwriting of the "Autograph Answers" and the "Original Manuscript" are the same, and the "Autograph Answers" are physical objects preserved by those who participated in it at the time, and it is indicated that it was written by Zhong Wang himself, which is relatively reliable.

Jin Yufu, in his article "Further Discussion on the Authenticity of the Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang Li Xiucheng's Autobiography" (published in the first issue of "Historical Research" in 1957), believes that one should not judge the authenticity of the "Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang's Autobiography" based solely on the "Edict to Li Zhaoshou." Zhong Wang's "Edict to Li Zhaoshou" was a document issued by Zhong Wang in October of the eighth year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, when he held the position of Deputy Commander of the Rear Army. At that time, Zhong Wang issued many similar documents, and he has seen eleven of them; the writing styles of these documents are somewhat similar to the "Edict to Li Zhaoshou," but none of them were written by Zhong Wang himself. He believes that the only basis for judging whether the "Original Manuscript of Zhong Wang's Autobiography" is genuine should be the "Autograph Answers" in the collection of Pang Jiyun's family. Now that the "Autograph Answers" and the "Original Manuscript" have been discovered in two different locations, and they are both from the same person's handwriting, it can be proved that the "Original Manuscript" is not forged. He also uses the content, words, and handwriting of the "Original Manuscript" to prove that the "Original Manuscript" is genuine.

Both Jing Heng and Jin Yufu believe that Luo Ergang was wrong to regard the "Edict to Li Zhaoshou" as Zhong Wang's handwriting. In addition, they raised different opinions on the reasons for Nian Zimin's assumption that Zeng Guofan forged the confession.

### 对“忠王自传原稿”真伪问题的争论

    对“忠王自传原稿”真伪问题的争论
    最近，史学界对太平天国忠王李秀成供词的真伪问题，引起了新的争论。
    先是在华东师范大学学报1956年第四期上，发表了年子敏、束世澂的“关于‘忠王自传原稿’真伪问题的商榷”的文章，对罗尔纲考定的“忠王自传原稿”的真实性发生了怀疑。年子敏认为，“忠王自传原稿”出于曾国藩的伪造，主要的理由是“忠王自传原稿”和另一“亲笔答词”的笔迹同又一遗墨“忠王谕李昭寿手书”的笔迹不符。他认为“忠王谕李昭寿手书”是目前忠王的唯一遗墨，而“忠王自传原稿”是假的（参见1956年11月19日本报学术动态）。
    年子敏的论证受到景珩和金毓黻的反对。
    景珩在“关于李秀成自传真伪问题的商讨”一文（载光明日报史学双周刊第98号）中认为，从“谕李昭寿书”和“忠王自传原稿”这两个笔迹不同的文献来对比考察，“原稿”是亲笔的可靠性较大。因为“谕李昭寿书”的内容是当时太平天国一种官文书体制，并不是私人手札。其中词句也是太平天国当时一般“书手”的一种撰文形式。不但书法整齐老练，而且词藻也整齐精练，从忠王的出身以及繁重的军事革命过程看，短短的年代里，不会达到这样的文化水平。像这一类官方文书，更不会由幕僚起草、忠王手抄。相反，自传“原稿”的内容、词汇、书法，很切合忠王的情况。他认为年子敏的考证，反而加强了“原稿”的真实性，因为证明了“亲笔答词”和“原稿”笔迹相同，而“亲笔答词”是当时亲身参与者所保留的实物，并且指明是忠王亲笔，可靠性比较大。
    金毓黻在“关于忠王李秀成自传原稿真伪问题的再商榷”一文（载历史研究1957年第一期）中认为，不能只拿“谕李昭寿书”判断“忠王自传原稿”的真伪。忠王“谕李昭寿书”是太平天国八年十月忠王职居副掌率后军主将时发出的文书。当时忠王发出的类似的文书很多，据他看到的有十一件；这些文书书写形式都和“谕李昭寿书”有些相似，但都不是忠王的亲笔。他认为判断“忠王自传原稿”是否真迹，应以庞际云家藏的“亲笔答词”为唯一根据。现在既然“亲笔答词”和“自传原稿”分在两地发现，并且都是出于一人的手笔，就可以证明“自传原稿”不是伪造的。他并且从“自传原稿”的内容、词句和笔迹等三个方面，来证明“自传原稿”是真的。
    景珩和金毓黻都认为，罗尔纲将“谕李昭寿书”看作是忠王手迹是错的。此外他们又对年子敏假定的曾国藩伪造供词的理由等问题，提出了不同的意见。
