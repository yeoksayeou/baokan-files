Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd: Employees of the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration are vigorously promoting ten effective advanced experiences.

More than one hundred tugboats, cargo ships, and passenger-cargo ships currently sailing on the Sichuan River are comprehensively promoting the safe navigation experiences of advanced producers Mo Jiarui and Yang Dafu, and the safe berthing experience of Zhou Bochang, and continuing to promote the shuttle-shaped pushing method and the single-row pushing method. Ships sailing between Yichang and Chongqing, using the shuttle-shaped pushing method, can shorten the average travel time by six hours compared to the original multi-row pushing method, increase cargo capacity by 20% to 30%, and save fuel by more than 10%. The single-row pushing method is even better than the shuttle-shaped pushing method. Once the spring flood arrives, the single-row pushing method will be promoted between Yichang and Wanxian.

Last year, the transportation capacity of the Sichuan River increased by 60% due to the continuous investment of newly built ships into production. Because the port facilities did not increase accordingly, a new situation arose where the port's throughput capacity could not meet the transportation needs. In order to improve throughput capacity, Chongqing Port, following the implementation of three-shift operations for tugboats last year, also focused on trial implementation of three-shift operations for loading and unloading work in December last year. In more than a month, loading and unloading efficiency has increased from not meeting the quota to now exceeding the quota by 20%. This experience not only improved loading and unloading efficiency, ensuring that fleets can depart on time with full loads, but also changed the previous situation of irregular working hours and uneven workload for loading and unloading workers. As of January 20, two of the three operating areas in Chongqing Port have implemented three-shift operations.

Last year, 93% of steam tugboats, cargo ships, and passenger-cargo ships on the Sichuan River promoted the three-stage firing method, saving the country more than 3,400 tons of coal in the second and third quarters. By the fourth quarter, due to the further reduction of coal consumption quotas, the increase in cargo capacity, and the decline in coal quality, the coal consumption of the Sichuan River fleet generally exceeded the quota. The Jiangyu vessel, because it created a cyclical segmented firing method on the basis of the three-stage firing method, still saved 70 tons of coal in the fourth quarter, reducing it by 8.8% compared to the quota. Now, the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration has dispatched specialists to specifically help steamships promote this advanced experience.

### 川江推行十种航运经验

    川江推行十种航运经验
    新华社重庆3日电　长江航运管理局重庆分局职工，大力推行十种行之有效的先进经验。
    现在航行在川江上的一百多条拖轮、货轮和客货轮正在全面推行先进生产者莫家瑞、杨大福的安全航行经验和周伯昌的安全开靠码头经验，继续推广梭形顶推法和一列式顶推法。航行宜昌到重庆间的船只采用梭形顶推法，比原来用多排式顶推法平均可以缩短航行时间六小时，增加载货量20％到30％，节约燃料10％以上。一列式顶推法比梭形顶推更加优越。春汛一到，宜昌到万县间就要推行一列式顶推法。
    去年川江运力因为新建船舶不断投入生产等原因，增加了60％；由于港口设备没有相应增加，出现了港口吞吐能力不能满足运输需要的新情况。重庆港为了提高吞吐能力，继去年拖轮实行昼夜三班作业之后，又在去年12月重点试行装卸工作昼夜三班作业。一个多月中，装卸效率由原来的达不到定额提高到现在突破定额20％。这一经验不但提高了装卸效率，保证船队可以按时满载开航，而且改变了以往装卸工人作息时间不固定、忙闲不均的情况。从1月20日起，在重庆港三个作业区中，已经有两个作业区实行了昼夜三班作业。
    去年川江上的蒸汽机拖轮、货轮、客货轮，有93％推行三段烧火法，在第二、第三季度曾为国家节约三千四百多吨煤。到第四季度，由于煤耗定额进一步降低，载货量增加，同时煤质下降，因此川江船队的煤耗普遍超过定额。江渝轮因为在三段烧火法的基础上创造循环分段烧火法，在第四季度仍然节约七十吨煤，比定额降低8.8％。现在长江航运管理局重庆分局已经分别派遣专人，具体帮助蒸汽船舶推广这一先进经验。
