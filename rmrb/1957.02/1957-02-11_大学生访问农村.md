    University Students Visit Rural Areas
    Dai Yue
    During the winter vacation, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League organized more than two thousand students from universities and colleges in Beijing to conduct publicity visits to rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing. After arriving in the countryside, they publicized the achievements of the country's first Five-Year Plan to the farmers, strengthening their confidence in taking the path of collectivization. They also saw the superiority displayed by agricultural cooperativization and the new look of the countryside, which also gave them practical education.
    During this time, the university students lived with the farmers in the countryside and took advantage of the Spring Festival to congratulate the farmers and have get-togethers with rural youths. Students from Beijing Agricultural University, who went to Luodaozhuang Agricultural Cooperative, also performed a crosstalk show they wrote themselves called "Running the Cooperative Diligently and Frugally" and "Managing the Family Diligently and Frugally," which was warmly welcomed by the farmers. The cooperative cadres enthusiastically introduced the students to the cooperative's high yields and the lives of the members, and accompanied the students to visit the homes of the members. Ke Yuzhuo, a fourth-year student in the Department of Soil Chemistry at Beijing Agricultural University, had come to Luodaozhuang during the 1955 Spring Festival to help them survey land boundaries and establish a library. Two years later, he came to this cooperative again during the Spring Festival. He saw that the members were all wearing new clothes, every family was eating dumplings, the houses were freshly painted, and several quilts were folded on the kangs (heated brick beds). Every household had a loudspeaker hanging on the door, so members could listen to the radio while sitting on the kang. He also learned that 90% of the farm households here had increased their income. In 1955, the farmers here did not eat much refined grain, but now they eat 70% refined grain. All of this made him feel that the changes in the countryside were changing with each passing day. The director of the cooperative also told him that they were preparing to install electric lights and welcomed him to come back and see them next year.
    Some of the students from Beijing Agricultural University were from the South and had little knowledge of the rural situation in the North in the past. This was the first time they had come to the rural areas of the North, and they felt that the soil, climate, crops, and customs of the farmers were very different from those in the South, which broadened their horizons and enriched their lives. During their visit, the farmers raised many questions about the promotion of agricultural technology. Last autumn, when the vegetable seedlings grew, the cooperative's vegetable technician used a sprayer to spray insecticide, and soon the seedlings were scorched, and the technician could not find the reason. The university students studied the matter and told the technician that it was because the sprayer nozzle was too large and too much pesticide was sprayed. This damage could be avoided if a mist sprayer was used. The students also learned a lot of production experience from the farmers. They felt that many of the farmers' experiences were not found in books and were very interesting. This time, they saw the superiority of agricultural cooperativization with their own eyes, which further consolidated their thinking about studying their majors.
    Students from Beijing Normal University went to the agricultural production cooperatives in Changping District and arrived just as the rectification of the cooperative was coming to an end. They learned about the hard work of the agricultural cooperative cadres in the conversations with the members, which was very educational.
    The Dongjiao District Advanced Agricultural Cooperative has more than 1,500 households and more than 7,000 people, and the allocation of labor is very complicated, so the cadres are very busy. The cooperative has more than 2,000 work point record books alone, which cannot be recorded during the day, so the cadres are busy until late at night, and no one complains. When there are shortcomings in their work, they earnestly correct them. The students were very moved by their selfless spirit of work. Some people said that we university students may not be able to do these things well. Some students also said that building socialism is not easy. Some students from Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Petroleum Institute used to complain that sleeping on double-decker bunks was uncomfortable, that there were not enough varieties of food, and some people did not cherish food and threw away leftover steamed buns at will. After visiting the countryside this time, they deeply felt that they should learn the farmers' diligent and simple style.
    More than 150 students from Beijing Institute of Technology visited Yongqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haidian District and Longquanwu and other townships in the Jingxi Mining Area. They lived with the local farmers for three days with simple luggage. Although the time was short, they got along very well with each other. The farmers' hard-working and simple style gave the students a meaningful lesson.

    大学生访问农村
    戴月
    在寒假期间，青年团北京市委员会组织了在北京的高等学校两千多名学生，到北京市郊农村进行宣传访问。他们到农村以后，向农民宣传了国家第一个五年计划的成就，加强了农民走合作化道路的信心。他们也看到了农业合作化所显示的优越性，农村的新景象，也使他们受到了实际的教育。
    这次大学生在农村里，同农民生活在一起，并利用春节，向农民祝贺，同农村青年联欢。北京农业大学的学生，到罗道庄农业合作社里，还演出了自编的相声“勤俭办社”、“勤俭治家”，受到农民的热烈欢迎。社干部们热情地向学生们介绍了社里丰产和社员的生活情况，并陪着学生访问社员家庭。北京农业大学土化系四年级学生柯于灼，在1955年春节曾到罗道庄帮助他们测划土地范围，建立图书馆。两年以后的春节，他又来到这个社。他看到了社员们都穿上新衣服，家家吃饺子，屋子粉刷一新，炕上的被子也叠起了好几床。每家房门上都挂着一个扩音器，社员坐在炕上就可以听广播。他还了解到这里90％的农户增加了收入。1955年，这里的农民吃细粮不多，现在就吃七成细粮。这一切，都使他感到农村的变化日新月异。社主任还告诉他：他们正在准备安装电灯。欢迎他明年再来看看。
    北京农业大学有些学生是南方人，过去对北方农村情况了解的很少。他们第一次到了北方的农村，感到土壤、气候、耕作物和农民的风俗习惯都跟南方有很大不同，开阔了眼界，丰富了生活。在他们的访问期间，农民向他们提出了许多推广农业技术的问题。去年秋天，菜苗长起来的时候，社里的蔬菜技术员用喷壶洒杀虫药水，不久菜苗就焦了，技术员找不到原因。大学生们研究了这件事，告诉技术员，那是因为喷壶眼太大，药水洒多了，如果用喷雾器就可以避免这种损害。学生们也向农民们学习了许多生产经验。他们感到农民们的许多经验是书本上所没有的，非常有兴趣。这次他们亲眼看到了农业合作化的优越性，进一步巩固了学习专业的思想。
    北京师范大学学生到昌平区的农业生产合作社去，正赶上整社工作刚刚结束。他们在社员的谈话里，了解到农业合作社干部工作的艰苦精神，受到很大教育。
    东郊区先进农业合作社有一千五百多户，七千多人，劳动力的调配非常复杂，干部工作很忙。社里单是记工手册就有两千多本，白天记不过来，干部们晚上一直忙到深夜，谁也不叫苦。工作有了缺点，他们都认真地改正。学生们看到了他们这种忘我的工作精神，都很感动。有的人说，这些事情让我们大学生来干也不一定干得好。还有些学生说，建设社会主义是不容易的。北京航空学院、北京石油学院有的学生过去嫌睡双层铺不舒服，伙食的花样少，也有的人不爱惜粮食，把吃剩的馒头随便扔掉。他们这次到农村访问以后，都深深感到要学习农民的勤俭朴素的作风。
    北京工业学院一百五十多名学生，到海淀区永青农业生产合作社和京西矿区龙泉雾等乡进行访问，他们带着简单的行李和当地农民生活了三天。虽然时间不长，但彼此处得很亲热。农民的艰苦朴素的作风，给同学上了有意义的一课。
