Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 12th: Shanghai has been experiencing unusually severe cold weather in the past few days, with snow accumulating on the streets and temperatures dropping to a low of -7.4 degrees Celsius, a level unseen in over eighty years of meteorological records. On the 10th and 11th, the city witnessed the rare phenomenon of snowfall under sunny skies. The sun shone brightly as snowflakes danced in the light, causing passersby to stop and gaze in wonder at the magnificent sight.

　　"One night of wind and snow, eight hundred children's corpses the next." These are the opening lines from poet Zang Kejia's poem "Zero Degree of Life," written in Shanghai in February 1947. It has been even colder these few days compared to ten years ago, but according to a survey by the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, no deaths due to freezing have been reported so far. The Civil Affairs Bureau has instructed all districts to strengthen relief work for residents facing hardship, particularly elderly individuals living alone with no support. To prevent the cold from affecting children's health, the Shanghai Education Bureau has postponed the opening date of all kindergartens in the city to the 18th.

    上海严寒民政局布置加强救济工作
    新华社上海12日电　这几天上海街头积雪不化，春寒料峭，最低温度下降到摄氏零下七点四度，上海人遇到了有气象记载的八十多年来罕见的严寒。10日和11日，这里出现了晴天下雪的现象。晴日高照，雪花在阳光中飞舞，行人纷纷住足仰视这个瑰丽的奇景。
      “前天一夜风雪，昨夜八百童尸。”这是诗人臧克家1947年2月在上海写下的诗篇“生命的零度”中开头的两句。这几天要比十年前冷得多，但据上海市民政局调查，到目前并没有发现冻死的人。民政局已布置各区加强对生活困难的居民特别是孤苦无依的老人的救济工作。为了避免寒冷影响儿童的健康，上海市教育局已将全市幼儿园的开学日期延至18日。
