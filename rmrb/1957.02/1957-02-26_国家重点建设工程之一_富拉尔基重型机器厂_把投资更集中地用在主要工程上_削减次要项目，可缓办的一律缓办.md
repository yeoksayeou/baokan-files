Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 25th: In arranging this year's construction projects, the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant is paying attention to the rational use of investment and the full utilization of funds to ensure that key projects can complete construction tasks on time.

This plant is one of the nation's key construction projects. This year is also the most critical year for the plant's construction. To ensure the commencement of key projects and to proceed according to the overall construction schedule, the plant conducted repeated studies and finally decided to concentrate investment on key projects, curtail secondary or deferrable projects, and defer all other basic construction and equipment. After proper arrangements, the main civil engineering workload, which accounts for the largest proportion of this year's construction investment, has not only not been reduced but has also increased. For example, according to the original plan, only the steel casting workshop was to have foundation piles. The new plan added more than 10,000 foundation piles for five workshops, including steel casting cleaning and rough machining heat treatment. The early completion of these major projects will play a significant role in the overall plant construction. According to the principle of ensuring key projects and appropriately taking care of welfare facilities, this year's dormitory construction project will be reduced from the original 70,000 square meters to 50,000 square meters; the staff spare-time school building has also been decided to be deferred. These two items alone can save more than 1.87 million yuan in investment. In terms of installation engineering, consideration is also given to installing projects that have a direct impact on current production or construction first; otherwise, installation will be deferred. Among them, such as underground cables, originally planned to be fully installed, are now planned to first install the most urgently needed main cables that have a direct impact on construction, which is expected to save more than one million yuan in investment. In terms of equipment purchase, the original plan was relatively large, but later it was considered that non-urgent equipment would be purchased and piled up without use, which would be a backlog of funds, so it was also greatly reduced.

To fully utilize the role of funds, the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant is working with the construction unit to comprehensively arrange this year's construction projects, prepare for winter construction and pre-construction work. And separately prepare for materials, construction design drawings, technical forces and other aspects. It is required to minimize idleness and waste in construction as much as possible, continuously improve engineering quality, and vigorously overcome the waste of materials.

    国家重点建设工程之一——富拉尔基重型机器厂
    把投资更集中地用在主要工程上
    削减次要项目，可缓办的一律缓办
    新华社哈尔滨25日电　富拉尔基重型机器厂在安排今年建设工程的时候，注意合理使用投资和充分发挥资金作用，以保证主要工程能按时完成建设任务。
    这个厂是国家重点建设工程之一。今年又是这个厂建设的最关键的一年。为了保证主要工程的开工和按建厂总进度进行，厂里做了反复研究，最后确定把投资更集中地使用在主要工程上，削减次要的或可以缓建的工程，其他基本建设和设备器具可缓办的一律缓办。经过妥善安排以后，占今年建设投资最大比重的土木建筑主要工程量不仅没有减少而且还有增加。如按原来计划，全厂只有铸钢车间要打基础桩，新计划增加了铸钢清理、粗加工热处理等五个车间打基础桩共一万多根。这些重大工程如能提前完工，对整个建厂将起重大作用。根据保证重点工程，适当照顾福利设施的原则，今年建设的宿舍工程将由原来的七万平方公尺，削减为五万平方公尺；职工业余学校大楼也决定缓建。仅这两项就可以节约投资一百八十七万多元。在安装工程方面，也考虑到先安装对当前生产或施工有直接影响的项目，否则，就缓安装。其中如地下电缆，原来准备全部安装，现在计划首先安装最急需的对施工有直接影响的主要电缆，预计能节约投资一百多万元。在设备购置方面，原计划较庞大，后来考虑到非急需的设备购置了堆放起来不用，就是积压资金，因此也大大的削减了。
    为充分发挥资金作用，富拉尔基重型机器厂正同施工单位研究，全面安排今年的建设工程，作好冬季施工和施工前准备工作。并且分头做好材料、施工设计图纸、技术力量等方面的准备工作。要求施工中尽可能做到少窝工浪费，不断地提高工程质量，大力克服材料的浪费现象。
