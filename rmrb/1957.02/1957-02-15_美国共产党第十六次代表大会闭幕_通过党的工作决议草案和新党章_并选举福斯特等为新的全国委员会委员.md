Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 13th (TASS dispatch): The 16th National Convention of the Communist Party USA concluded on February 12th. On this day, the convention amended and adopted the draft resolution on the work of the party and the new party constitution, and newly elected twenty members of the Party's National Committee.

A Party spokesperson told reporters that the convention adopted the draft resolution on the work of the Party and the amendments to the draft proposed at the convention. The resolution emphasized that the Communist Party USA is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The convention suggested that the newly elected Party's National Committee elect a drafting committee for a new party program, which will be submitted to all party members for discussion. The convention also adopted the new party constitution.

The convention then elected members of the National Committee of the Communist Party USA, electing twenty members in total. The remaining forty members of the committee will be elected at party conventions in each state. The elected members include: Alexander, Lightfoot, James Jackson, Dowell Healy, Ben Davis, Eugene Dennis, William Z. Foster, E. Bahm, Doxey Wilkerson, Carl Winter, D. Hermel, F. Fine, A. Korea, Carl Ross, A. Richmond, John Gates, S. Stein, D. Davis, Lohman, Joe Charny.

During a recess of the convention, the Party's National Committee held a meeting. Subsequently, Dennis, representing the National Committee, reported on the committee's work to the convention. He suggested that the convention establish a National Management Committee. This committee should implement the resolutions of the National Convention before the first plenary session of the National Committee is held, which is scheduled to take place after the conclusion of the party conventions in each state.

Dennis, representing the members of the National Committee, suggested that after the National Committee has been supplemented by the forty members elected by the party conventions in each state, it should establish a Standing Management Committee and a Secretariat. The convention approved the National Committee's report by an overwhelming majority.

The convention announced that it had received congratulatory messages from the Communist or Workers' Parties of twenty-nine countries, including the Soviet Union, China, Italy, France, and Czechoslovakia.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 13th (TASS dispatch): At its closing session on February 12th, the 16th National Convention of the Communist Party USA adopted the Party's new constitution.

The preamble to the Party constitution, which defines the Party's purpose, states: "The Communist Party is the political organization of the American working class based on the principles of scientific socialism."

"The Communist Party defends the fundamental and vital interests of workers, farmers, Black people, and all those engaged in manual and intellectual labor who oppose capitalist exploitation and oppression."

"The Communist Party believes that the exploitation of man by man, poverty, war, racism, and ignorance will inevitably be eliminated with the socialist transformation of society, the establishment of public ownership, and the development of the national economy under the leadership of a people's government headed by the working class."

"The Communist Party believes that there are various paths to socialism, and that the working people of our country will surely find their own path to socialism."

The preamble continues, stating that the Communist Party "conducts an irreconcilable struggle against imperialism and colonial oppression, sanctions and eliminates monopoly power, opposes racial, ethnic, and religious discrimination, opposes anti-Semitism and all forms of chauvinism. The Communist Party believes that the struggle to eliminate racial discrimination and immediately win full civil rights and unconditional equality for Black people is a fundamental condition for the struggle for democracy."

"The Communist Party follows a major principle: that there exists a commonality of interests, a link that unites the workers of all countries. The Communist Party also believes that the true national interests of our country, as well as the cause of peace and progress, require the unity of all freedom-loving peoples, the peaceful coexistence of all countries, and the strengthening of the United Nations as a universal means of guaranteeing peace. The Communist Party believes that these common links will be strengthened if the working-class movement operates in an independent and equal environment and enjoys the right to fraternal, comradely criticism."

The preamble points out that "the theoretical foundation of communism is the overall democratic, scientific, and humanitarian traditions of mankind, in particular the doctrines of the great figures of scientific socialism, Marx, Engels, and Lenin."

The Party constitution states that any American citizen who is at least eighteen years old and accepts the Party's principles and purposes may join the Party.

The constitution then explains the Party's general organizational principles and the organizational principles of Party organizations in each state and locality.

    丹尼斯代表全国委员会委员建议：全国委员会在补足了由各州党代表会议选出的四十名委员之后，成立一个党常务管理委员会和书记处。代表大会以绝大多数票通过了全国委员会的报告。
    大会宣布，大会接到了包括苏联、中国、意大利、法国、捷克斯洛伐克等二十九个国家的共产党或工人党的贺电。
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社纽约13日讯：美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会12日在闭幕会议上通过了党的新章程。
    党章中确定共产党宗旨的序言中说：“共产党是以科学的社会主义原则为基础的美国工人阶级的政治组织。”
    “共产党卫护工人、农民、黑人和一切从事体力和脑力劳动、反对资本主义剥削和压迫的人的根本切身利益。
    “共产党认为，人剥削人、贫穷、战争、种族主义和愚昧，必将随着社会的社会主义改造，公有制的建立以及国家经济在以工人阶级为首的人民政府的领导下得到发展而消灭。”
    “共产党认为，走向社会主义有着各种不同的道路，而我国的劳动人民一定会找到一条走向社会主义的自己的道路。”
    序言中接着说，共产党“进行不调和的斗争来反对帝国主义和殖民压迫，制裁和消灭垄断政权，反对种族、民族和宗教歧视，反对反犹太主义和各种各样的沙文主义。共产党认为，消灭种族歧视的斗争以及立刻为黑人争取充分的公民权利和无条件的平等，是争取民主的斗争的基本条件”。
    “共产党遵循着一个主要的原则：即存在着一种利益的共同性，这种共同性是联合各国工人的联系环节。共产党还认为，我国真正的民族利益以及和平和进步的事业，要求一切爱好自由的人民团结起来，要求各国和平共处和加强作为保证和平的普遍手段的联合国。共产党认为，如果工人阶级的运动在独立和平等的环境中进行活动，并且享有进行兄弟的、同志的批评的权利，这些共同的联系就会加强。”
    序言中指出，“共产主义的理论的基础是人类总的民主、科学和人道主义的传统，其中特别是科学的社会主义的伟人马克思、恩格斯和列宁的学说。”
    党章中说到，凡是年满十八岁，接受党的原则和宗旨的任何美国公民，都可以加入党。
