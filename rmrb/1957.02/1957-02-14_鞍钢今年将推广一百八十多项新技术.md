Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 12th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company will adopt and promote more than 180 new technologies and advanced experiences in various factories and mines this year. Among the new technologies already adopted, more than 40 have yielded good results in increasing production.

    No. 9 blast furnace of the Iron Smelting Plant has adopted the new high-pressure furnace top technology, and is now preparing to further promote seven important advanced experiences such as furnace top burden distribution, high hot blast temperature operation, and rapid tuyere changing. The No. 1 Steelmaking Plant promoted the experience of rapid furnace repair last year, which shortened the repair time and increased steel ingot production by more than 16,000 tons. This year, the plant plans to continue to promote this experience, as well as the experiences of steam injection of tar and compressed air blowing in molten iron ladles. The Medium Rolling Mill is currently promoting the cross-rolling method. Using this method, the yield of steel can be increased by 5%.

    The adoption of these advanced methods can not only increase production and quality but also save a lot of wealth. The rolling rolls used in Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various rolling mills are very expensive and mostly become waste after being used dozens of times. This year, the factory will promote the method of welding with high-quality alloy welding rods. The lifespan of the rolls after welding can be extended three times.

    鞍钢今年将推广一百八十多项新技术
    据新华社鞍山12日电　鞍山钢铁公司今年在各厂矿要采用和推广一百八十多项新技术和先进经验。在已经采用的新技术中，有四十多项在提高生产方面得到好的效果。
    炼铁厂九号高炉已经采用高压炉顶新技术，现在又准备进一步推广炉顶布料、高风温操作、快速换风口等七项重要的先进经验。第一炼钢厂去年推广快速补炉经验缩短了补炉时间，增产钢锭一万六千多吨。今年这个厂计划继续推广这项经验，并且推广蒸汽喷焦油和铁水罐吹压缩空气等经验。中型轧钢厂目前正在推广交叉轧钢法，用这种方法，可提高钢材收得率5％。
    采用这些先进方法，不仅能提高产量和质量，还能节约很多财富。鞍钢各轧钢厂所用的轧辊价格很贵，大都使用几十次以后就成了废物。今年这个厂将推行高质合金焊条焊补的方法，焊补后的轧辊寿命能延长三倍。
