    Response to Criticism

    A letter from the Zhaoliqiao Tax Office of the Puqi County Tax Bureau: The People's Daily published an article on January 22nd, third edition, entitled "What Doesn't Count as Forging a Certificate," which criticized our office for taxing the Atractylodes macrocephala produced by the Shiyan Agricultural Cooperative. After our review, these Atractylodes macrocephala were indeed self-produced, and we processed the tax refund on February 4th. Some agricultural cooperatives have been issuing "self-produced" certificates indiscriminately to their members, and some individual members have even sold "self-produced" certificates to speculators or given "self-produced" certificates to relatives and friends to evade national taxes. Therefore, we have been stricter in our checks. In addition, the certificate from the Shiyan Cooperative had several alterations, and individual cadres in our office were not careful enough in their work, so we levied the wrong tax.

    对批评的反应
    蒲圻县税务局赵李桥税务所来信：人民日报1月22日第三版所登
  “怎样才不算伪造证明”一文，批评我所把石堰农业社自产的白术征了税。经我们复查，这些白术确属自产，已于2月4日办理了退税手续。有些农业社给社员滥发“自产”证明，甚至有个别社员向投机商人出卖“自产”证明，或把“自产”证明送给亲友以偷漏国税。因此，我们在检查的时候控制得比较严格。加以石堰社的证明涂改了几处，我所个别干部在工作中又不够细致，就征错了。
