The "Eisenhower Doctrine" has been in the international political lexicon for less than two months, but it has already become a most sinister term in the hearts of millions. This colonialist plan for aggression against the Middle East, announced by the United States, has not only aroused strong protests from many government officials and the broad masses of the people in Arab countries, but has also been universally attacked by public opinion in Asia, Africa, and Europe. In the United States, too, many people have risen up to oppose this provocative plan. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is besieged on all sides.

In this situation, the US ruling clique has had to re-paint and re-equip this "Eisenhower Doctrine," which has already been revised twelve times, in order to deceive public opinion and ease and reduce opposition and resistance to the implementation of this aggressive plan. Thus, the menacing face has been transformed into a hypocritical smile, and the arrogant clamor has lowered its tone. Initially, the United States announced that the US president would have the "right" to act freely in the Middle East and use US armed forces whenever he deemed it necessary; but when the House of Representatives passed the plan, it changed its tune, saying that the president's "power" should be exercised "to the maximum extent practicable through the United Nations." Initially, the United States announced that if it believed that there was so-called "indirect aggression" and "subversive activities" in a certain Middle Eastern country, then the United States would also take action; however, when the House Foreign Affairs Committee put forward a draft congressional resolution on the "Eisenhower Doctrine," it had to admit that the United States should "avoid specifically discussing policies of internal subversion," because Middle Eastern countries would consider this to be "the United States usurping the right to interfere in their internal affairs." Initially, Dulles announced that if any country sent volunteers to the Middle East, the United States would consider it "open aggression"; but a few days later, he had to change his tune, saying that if these volunteers were invited by Middle Eastern countries, then the United States would not consider it an "act of aggression." At the same time, the United States also shelved its much-touted theory of so-called "filling the power vacuum." US news agencies reported that Eisenhower "intends to abandon this theory."

One thing is clear: wherever the United States has changed its tune, it is precisely where it has met with the strongest opposition from the people of all countries. These embellishments made by the United States to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" are entirely out of necessity. However, these revisions do not in the slightest indicate that the essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has changed. On the contrary, it is only to conceal and maintain the basic content of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The United States has not abandoned its policy of military threat to the Middle East; the so-called "through the United Nations" is merely a veil. The United States has also not abandoned its policy of interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. Dulles' declaration that the United States would help Middle Eastern countries establish a "loyal security force" to maintain the "order" of these countries is the most blatant interference. As for the ambitious plan to seize Middle Eastern oil included in the "Eisenhower Doctrine," it is well known; the recent support of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" by some American oil capitalists is the best proof.

While busy whitewashing the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States is conducting open and secret wooing and division activities in Middle Eastern countries. Recently, the US government invited some Middle Eastern leaders to visit the United States and tried its best to put on all kinds of friendly gestures, but behind these "friendly" gestures are hidden very sinister purposes. US news agencies openly admitted that all this was only to "induce" Middle Eastern countries to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." During the visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to the United States, this American activity was particularly evident. On January 28, the "New York Times" published an editorial saying: "Obviously, we want Saudi Arabia to be on the side of the free world." Then, this editorial nakedly provoked the relationship between Arab countries, saying that "Egypt is a dangerous ally of Saudi Arabia!" Other American newspapers revealed that the American approach was to use both hard and soft tactics, to please some Arab countries and to attack others, in order to achieve the purpose of division, so as to create conditions for the implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." A smile hiding a dagger! This is the true face of the planners of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The knife of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is aimed on the one hand at the independent countries of the Middle East, and on the other hand at the remaining forces of the British and French colonialists in the Middle East. Its purpose is to suppress the national independence movement in the Middle East, while at the same time squeezing out Britain and France, in order to completely turn the Middle East into its own sphere of influence. Therefore, while stepping up the promotion of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States is even more brazenly demanding that Britain and France withdraw from the Middle East. US officials openly discussed that Britain should not participate in Middle East "defense" and should withdraw from the Baghdad Pact. The "Washington Post and Times Herald" wrote aggressively: "The reality demands that the British recognize the power of the United States in the free world." However, the problem is not who should recognize whose "power," but that the conflicting interests of the colonialists are irreconcilable. Under the shadow of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," Western colonial countries are continuing to use the Middle East as a place for their fierce battles.

Insightful Arab political leaders and the broad masses of the people have seen that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has posed a great danger to their independence and freedom and to peace in the Middle East. There should be no illusions about the sweet words of imperialism, otherwise what is gained is insignificant, while what is lost will be incalculable. At present, the common and fundamental interest of the people of all Middle Eastern countries is to unite and smash the imperialist aggression plan. On February 11, Egyptian President Nasser pointed out that when the Arab world is not united, it will be easily harmed by aggressors and investors. Therefore, he called on Arab countries to unite. He said that Egypt firmly believes that it should maintain unity for its own security and strength in order to smash aggressors and imperialists.

Now, the US Congress is preparing to finally pass the "Eisenhower Doctrine." However, it is not the US Congress that determines the fate of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," but the unity and strength of the people of the Middle East and Asian and African countries. The people of the Middle East can defeat the guns of the British and French colonialists, and they can also defeat the hard and soft knives of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The people of the Middle East can drive the British and French aggressors into the sea, and they can also bury the aggressive plan of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the desert. As long as the people of all countries unite and fight, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is destined to go completely bankrupt and fail.

### 给“艾森豪威尔主义”涂脂抹粉

    给“艾森豪威尔主义”涂脂抹粉
    “艾森豪威尔主义”出现在国际政治辞典里还不到两个月，但是它在千百万人民的心中却已成为一个最邪恶的字眼了。美国所宣布的这个侵略中东的殖民主义计划，不仅引起阿拉伯国家的许多政府人士和广大人民的强烈抗议，而且遭到亚洲、非洲以及欧洲各国舆论的普遍的攻击。在美国国内，也有不少人起来反对这个挑衅的计划。“艾森豪威尔主义”正处于四面楚歌中。
    在这种情况下，美国统治集团不得不把这个已经修改过十二次的“艾森豪威尔主义”，再来加以粉刷和改装，以便蒙骗舆论，缓和和减弱对推行这一侵略计划的反对和阻力。于是，气势汹汹的面孔一变而为伪善的笑脸，狂妄的叫嚣也放低了腔调。开头，美国宣布说，只要美国总统认为必要，他就有“权”在中东自由行动，使用美国武装部队；但是当众议院通过这个计划时却改口说，总统的这种“权力”应该在“切实可行的最大限度内通过联合国而加以施行”。开头，美国宣布说，如果它认为某个中东国家存在所谓“间接侵略”和“颠覆活动”，那么美国就也要采取行动；但是，当众议院外委会提出关于“艾森豪威尔主义”的国会决议草案时又不得不承认：美国应该“避免具体谈到从内部颠覆的政策”，因为中东国家将认为这是“美国僭取干涉它们的内政的权利”。开头，杜勒斯宣布说，只要任何国家派遣志愿人员到中东去，那么美国就认为是“公开的侵略”；但是过了不几天，他又不得不改口说，如果这些志愿人员是应中东国家的邀请，那么美国就不认为是“侵略行动”了。与此同时，美国把它曾经大吹大擂的所谓“填补势力真空”论也收起来了，美国通讯社宣传说，艾森豪威尔“打算抛弃这个理论”。
    有一点是很清楚的，凡是美国改口的地方，恰恰是遭到各国人民反对最厉害的地方。美国对“艾森豪威尔主义”所作的这些装饰，完全是出于不得已。但是，这些修改丝毫也不能说明“艾森豪威尔主义”的实质有了改变。相反，它只是为了掩饰和保持“艾森豪威尔主义”的基本内容。美国并没有放弃对中东实行军事威胁的政策，所谓“通过联合国”，不过是一种面纱而已。美国也没有放弃对中东国家内政的干涉政策，杜勒斯宣称要由美国帮助中东国家建立一支“忠心耿耿的保安部队”来维持这些国家的“秩序”，就是最露骨的干涉。至于“艾森豪威尔主义”所包括的夺取中东石油的野心勃勃的计划，更是人所共知的；近来有一些美国石油资本家亲自出来支持“艾森豪威尔主义”，就是最好的证明。
    美国一边忙于粉刷“艾森豪威尔主义”，一边就对中东国家进行公开的和暗地的拉拢和分裂活动。最近美国政府邀请一些中东国家领导人访问美国，并极力装出各种各样的友善姿态，而在这种“友善”姿态的背后却隐藏着十分阴险的目的。美国通讯社公开承认，这一切只是为了“诱使”中东国家接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。在沙特阿拉伯国王访问美国期间，美国的这种活动进行得特别明显。1月28日，“纽约时报”发表社论说：“显然，我们希望沙特阿拉伯在自由世界方面”。接着，这篇社论竟赤裸裸地挑拨阿拉伯国家之间的关系，说什么“埃及是沙特阿拉伯的危险的盟国”（！）另外一些美国报纸则透露，美国的做法是软硬兼施，讨好一部分阿拉伯国家，打击另一部分阿拉伯国家，以达到分化的目的，这样来为执行“艾森豪威尔主义”创造条件。笑里藏刀！这就是“艾森豪威尔主义”策划者的真面目。
    “艾森豪威尔主义”的刀子一方面针对着中东的独立国家，一方面也针对着英法殖民者在中东的残余势力。它的目的就是要镇压中东的民族独立运动，同时排挤英法，以便把中东完全变为自己的势力范围。因此，美国在加紧推销“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，就更加嚣张地要求英法退出中东。美国官员们公开议论英国最好不要参加中东“防务”，并脱离巴格达条约。“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”咄咄逼人地写道：“现实局势要求英国人承认美国在自由世界中的威力”。但是，问题并不在于究竟谁应该承认谁的“威力，而在于殖民主义者的利害冲突是不可能调和的。在“艾森豪威尔主义”的阴影下，西方殖民国家正继续把中东地区作为它们激烈角斗的场所。
    有见识的阿拉伯国家的政治领袖和广大人民都看到，“艾森豪威尔主义”已经对它们的独立自由和中东地区的和平造成极大的危险。对于帝国主义的花言巧语是不能有任何幻想的，否则得到的东西微不足道，而失去的东西却将是不可估量的。目前中东各国人民的共同的根本利益，就是要团结一致粉碎帝国主义的侵略计划。2月11日，埃及总统纳赛尔指出，当阿拉伯世界不团结的时候，它就会容易遭受侵略者和投资者之害。因此，他呼吁阿拉伯国家团结。他说，埃及坚信应当为了自己的安全和力量而保持团结，以便粉碎侵略者和帝国主义者。
    现在，美国国会正准备最后通过“艾森豪威尔主义”。但是，决定“艾森豪威尔主义”命运的并不是美国国会，而是中东和亚非各国人民的团结和力量。中东人民能够打败英法殖民者的枪炮，也就同样能够打败“艾森豪威尔主义”的硬刀子和软刀子。中东人民能够把英法侵略者赶下海去，也就同样能够把“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划埋葬在沙漠里。只要各国人民团结起来斗争，“艾森豪威尔主义”是注定了要彻底破产和失败的。
