Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th Dispatch: Saudi Arabian King Saud, who is visiting the United States, held his last meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower on the 8th. The two countries issued a joint communiqué after the meeting. The communiqué stated that the United States agreed to provide Saudi Arabia with military "aid" "to strengthen the armed forces of Saudi Arabia." The United States also agreed to consider the issue of providing economic "aid." At the same time, the Saudi Arabian side agreed that the United States could continue to occupy the Dhahran Air Base in Saudi Arabia for a period of five years.

Saud stated in the communiqué that "he intends to continue to cooperate closely with the United States." He also "expressed satisfaction" with Eisenhower's explanation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The communiqué between the two countries also said that the two governments will do their best to seek a fair resolution of various issues in the Middle East region through peaceful and legal means within the scope stipulated by the United Nations Charter.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th Dispatch: The "Daily Telegraph" published an editorial on the 6th, saying that Britain is uneasy about the United States' intention to provide military aid to Saudi Arabia.

The newspaper worried that this action would hit Britain's influence in the Middle East. The newspaper believes that if Saudi Arabia's armed forces are strengthened, it may "do whatever it wants on the Buraimi issue," which will affect "some Sudanese and Muslim clerics who are friendly to Britain."

The newspaper also believes that the proposed meeting between the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister will not reach any understanding on Middle East policy unless their officials can first agree on a diagnosis of the situation there.

    艾森豪威尔同沙特会谈结束
    美国用军火和金元换取沙特阿拉伯的军事基地
    英报担心英国在中东的势力将遭到打击
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：访问美国的沙特阿拉伯国王沙特同美国总统艾森豪威尔8日举行了最后一次会谈。会后两国发表了一个联合公报。公报说明，美国答应给沙特阿拉伯军事“援助”，“以加强沙特阿拉伯的武装部队”。美国并且同意考虑给予经济“援助”的问题。同时，沙特阿拉伯方面同意美国在五年期间内继续占用沙特阿拉伯的扎赫兰机场。
    沙特在公报中表示，“他打算继续同美国密切合作”。他还对艾森豪威尔对“艾森豪威尔主义”所作的解释“表示满意”。
    两国的公报还说：两国政府将尽力争取在联合国宪章规定的范围内通过和平的、合法的手段公正地解决中东地区的各项问题。
    新华社9日讯　伦敦消息：“每日电讯报”6日发表社论说，英国对美国打算给沙特阿拉伯以军事援助感到不安。
    这家报纸担心这个行动将打击英国在中东的势力。报纸认为，如果沙特阿拉伯的武装力量有了增强，它就有可能“在布赖米问题上随心所欲”，这样一来，就会影响“对英国友好的一些苏丹和回教教主”。
    这家报纸还认为，拟议中的美国总统和英国首相会议在中东政策方面将得不到什么谅解，除非是他们的官员们首先能够同意对那里的局势作一次诊断。
