Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 29th - Chengdu is constructing a comprehensive telecommunications building. The ground floor of the building has been completed, and the cable duct project for automatic telephones on ten major streets in the city is nearing completion.

    This three-story building, covering an area of 4,700 square meters, will be completed this autumn. In addition to retaining most of the original manual telephones, Chengdu will also install a new batch of automatic telephones. The automatic telephone exchange in the comprehensive telecommunications building is equipped with sound insulation, fire prevention, dust prevention, and air conditioning equipment, which can maintain cleanliness and quietness indoors, reduce machine failures, and ensure clear calls.

    In terms of long-distance telephone service, new domestically produced common-battery long-distance switchboards, automatic timers, and new power supply equipment will be installed. The number of telephone circuits will increase by 20% compared to the present, enabling direct calls with many major cities in the country.

    The number of telegraph circuits will also increase by more than 20% compared to the present. Pneumatic and belt conveyor systems will be installed between the telegraph office, telegraph room, and delivery room, which can shorten telegraph transmission time by ten minutes.
