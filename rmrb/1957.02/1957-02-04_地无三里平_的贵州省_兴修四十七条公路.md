Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Guizhou Province, where mountain ranges are continuous and it is described as "where no three li of land is flat," is constructing forty-seven highways.

　　The newly built highways extend to remote mountainous areas and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities. Libo County in the southeastern corner of Guizhou Province, inhabited by the Bouyei and Shui ethnic groups, previously had no highways at all. Now, two highways are being built to this area from Dushan County and Sandu Shui Autonomous County respectively. Xishui County in the northern alpine region was originally not expected to have highways during the first Five-Year Plan, but now a highway to Xishui is also under construction. After these new lines are completed, most of them will be connected to the four main highways with Guiyang as the center: Sichuan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou, Hunan-Guizhou, and Guizhou-Guangxi, forming a roughly scaled mountain highway network. At that time, out of the province's eighty-one counties and cities, only Chishui County in the north and Congjiang County in the southeast will not have access to automobiles.

    “地无三里平”的贵州省
    兴修四十七条公路
    据新华社讯　在山岭绵延被形容成“地无三里平”的贵州省，有四十七条公路正在修建。
    新建的公路线是伸向交通闭塞的边沿山区和少数民族聚居区的。贵州省东南角上布依族、水族聚居的荔波县过去一条公路也没有，现在，有两条公路分别从独山县和三都水族自治县修往这个地方。北部高寒山区里的鳛水县原来预计在第一个五年计划期间还不通公路，现在一条通到鳛水的公路也正在施工。这些新线完工以后，大部分能和以贵阳为中心的川黔、滇黔、湘黔、黔桂四条公路干线衔接，构成一个粗具规模的山区公路网。那时，全省八十一县、市只剩北部的赤水县和东南的从江县不通汽车了。
