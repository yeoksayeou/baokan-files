Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" published on the 17th a letter from the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party to the Provisional Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. The letter was signed and issued by Nozaka Sanzo, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party.
    The letter, in discussing the Hungarian incident instigated by imperialist elements, stated that we believe that the Soviet Union's assistance saved socialism in Hungary and played a decisive role in the cause of defending world peace. If the imperialist elements had been victorious in Egypt and their attack on Hungary had been successful, they would have used these places as military bases to attack the people of the world, which would have increased the danger of a third world war. We sincerely express that we will stand in solidarity with the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian people in their struggle to overcome great difficulties and in their victory.
    The letter went on to say that the Hungarian incident has taught us many things. First of all, it has made us understand that the significance of international proletarian solidarity is now particularly increased. In the struggle against harmful views such as chauvinism and nationalism, the party should be armed with the ideas of proletarian internationalism. At the same time, mutual friendly criticism should be strengthened, cooperation between the parties of various countries should be strengthened, and international solidarity should continue to be strengthened.
    The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party hopes that the members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party will unite closely under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and work together to strive for world peace and the victory of socialism.

    日共中央写信给匈社会主义工人党
    坚决和匈牙利人民团结在一起
    据新华社18日讯　匈牙利“人民自由报”17日刊载了日本共产党中央委员会写给匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会的一封信，这封信是由日共中央第一书记野坂参三签名发出的。
    这封信在谈到帝国主义分子阴谋策动的匈牙利事件时说，我们相信，苏联的援助挽救了匈牙利的社会主义，并且在保卫世界和平的事业中起了决定性的作用。如果帝国主义分子在埃及得到了胜利，他们对匈牙利的进攻得到了成功，他们就会把这些地方当作军事基地，来进攻世界各国的人民，这就扩大了第三次世界大战的危险性。我们衷心地表示，在匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利人民在克服巨大困难的斗争中和胜利中，我们都将和他们团结在一起。
    这封信接着说，匈牙利事件使我们学会了许多东西，首先使我们明白，国际无产阶级团结的意义现在特别增大了，在反对如沙文主义和民族主义这些有害观点的斗争中，应该用无产阶级国际主义的思想把党武装起来，同时应该加强相互间的友善批评，加强各国党之间的合作，并且继续加强国际团结。
    日本共产党中央委员会希望匈牙利社会主义工人党的党员在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下紧紧地团结起来，同心协力为世界和平和社会主义的胜利而奋斗。
