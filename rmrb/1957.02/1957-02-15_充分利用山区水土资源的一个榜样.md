An Example of Fully Utilizing Mountainous Water and Soil Resources
Vice Minister of Water Resources, He Jili

In December 1956, I inspected the water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation work in Jiyuan County, Henan Province. The county has made great achievements in water conservancy work in recent years. Now, I will talk about some of the situations I saw and some of my experiences:

Jiyuan County is located in the northwest corner of Henan, spanning the southern foothills of the Taihang Mountains. Except for a few flatlands along the Mang River, most of the area is rocky mountainous forest and undulating hills. The mountainous area covers more than 2.1 million mu (accounting for more than 70% of the total area) and can be divided into deep mountainous areas, shallow mountainous areas, and hilly areas according to the terrain. In the long past, trees in the mountains were cut down indiscriminately. In order to maintain their livelihoods, the masses were forced to cultivate steep slopes, resulting in massive soil and water loss. The cultivated land was rocky with thin soil, and the yield was very low, with only about 80 jin of grain per mu. In the great drought of 1942, more than 60 of the 90 households in Huling Village starved to death. A folk rhyme circulated among the mountain people: "Bald mountains, no water in the gullies, hoping for next year, but never a harvest."

The Mang River is a large river within the county. The riverbed has a large longitudinal slope and is deep. The floods come suddenly and go quickly, with a maximum flow of up to 1,000 cubic meters per second, but only 100 cubic meters per second can be accommodated downstream. Therefore, floods often cause large-scale flooding every flood season.

From the above situation, it can be seen that Jiyuan is a region with complex terrain and frequent droughts and floods.

After liberation, the Party and the People's Government paid special attention to the production and construction work in the mountainous areas. The county's party and government leading organs, based on the principle of "overall planning and comprehensive development," adopted measures tailored to local conditions for different regions:

In the deep mountainous areas, forestry is the main focus, and activities such as closing hillsides for afforestation and planting trees are carried out. After liberation, hillsides were closed first, and the contradiction between forestry and animal husbandry was resolved. The solution was "three closures and three non-closures": pastoral areas are not closed, non-pastoral areas are closed; trees are closed, but not grass; mountains near are closed, but not distant mountains. After the trees have grown into forests, they can be reopened. In this way, it not only meets the long-term interests of the masses but also takes care of their current interests. In recent years, more than 710,000 mu of hillsides have been closed for afforestation, and 150,000 mu of trees have been planted. Currently, the trees have grown into forests, which controls soil and water loss. For example, before afforestation in Huling Village, a large amount of soil was washed away on the slopes during heavy rains, and the river water in front of the village turned yellow and dried up after the rain. After afforestation, the ground is now covered with about a foot of leaves and grass, the river water is light white after rain and gradually becomes clear, and there is water in the river all year round. The masses say that now it is "no water seen for three days after rain, and the water flows for many days after the rain." Tree planting is also combined with the interests of the masses. For example, from 1949 to the present, Li Bazhuang Township has planted more than 34,000 mu of trees. In 1955, the income from cutting pit props, rafters, and tree seeds totaled more than 20,000 yuan, equivalent to 18% of agricultural income.

Building valley dams in mountain gullies is an effective way to store water, conserve soil, silt land, and increase agricultural income. Since liberation, the county has built valley dams to silt up about 5,000 mu of land. Huling Village alone, with 62 households, has built 350 dams in gullies, with a total length of more than 5,200 zhang. The masses have summarized that this has four major benefits: retaining mud, storing water, preserving fertilizer, and expanding cultivated land area. In 1952, farmer Ren Yushan built a dam in an earthen gully next to his door to silt up two mu of land, and he harvested 800 jin of wheat in one year. The masses reflected: "Dam gully land, grain in storage, maintains soil and water, and also increases income, truly killing two birds with one stone."

Building small reservoirs in mountainous hills to turn water hazards into water conservancy. The county has built a total of 70 small reservoirs in the gullies with springs in the mountainous hilly areas in conjunction with soil and water conservation. The dam heights of these reservoirs are all between 10 and 17 meters, with a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, and the largest up to 2 million cubic meters. According to my understanding, these reservoirs are mainly built by the masses. A total of 63 reservoirs were built in the spring of 1956, and the state only subsidized 45,000 yuan for materials, which is only 714 yuan per reservoir. The reservoirs are also built to standard, with filter layers, spillways, and culverts, and they have not been washed away after being tested by floods. The upper reaches of the reservoirs are combined with hillside closure for afforestation and the construction of valley dam projects, so the reservoirs have very little siltation and are all clear water. The masses use clear water to irrigate the highlands through culverts. The 70 reservoirs store more than 6 million cubic meters of water in total, irrigating more than 80,000 mu of land, and can control floods in a watershed area of about 420 square kilometers, which not only combines irrigation but also plays a role in flood control. The masses say: "Small reservoirs are treasures of the mountains, preventing both drought and flooding."

How were the technical forces for these reservoirs obtained? I asked the responsible comrades of the county, and they said: There are only three technicians in the county, all of whom are on key projects. At the beginning of the project, more than 200 farmers from various places were transferred to participate in the construction. After completion, they all learned a set of skills, and after returning, they started working enthusiastically.

In the hilly and arid areas, terraced fields are built by cutting inside and padding outside, raising the high and padding the low to ensure increased production in the mountains. The terraces are slightly lower inside and higher outside. In addition, according to the size of the plots, earthen ridges are added in the middle so that water flows into the land, storing it if it is small and flowing around if it is large, silting up the land with sediment. This can play the role of "storing water in each plot and retaining mud in each section." The masses have summarized its three major benefits: sediment does not go down the mountain, reducing downstream siltation; silting land preserves moisture, preventing drought and flooding; the land changes from barren to fertile. For example, Ren Yushan in Li Bazhuang Township increased the yield per mu by 40 jin compared to land that was not processed. In recent years, the county has built about 60,000 dams (covering about 100,000 mu of land). In order to retain floodwater, water cellars are dug on both sides of the gullies with flood sources, where there are no trees and which do not affect production and transportation. One cellar can store 600 to 1,000 dan of water, which can resist drought and protect seedlings on 5 to 10 mu of land. For example, Gengzhang Township is an arid area, and in the past, the masses had difficulty even getting drinking water. In 1953, 291 water cellars were built, and in 1954, each household planted 0.3 mu of vegetables. In 1955, 995 mu of corn were planted during the drought.

In the plains, water resources are fully utilized for power generation and irrigation. A flood diversion and irrigation control gate was built in Gudan, allowing only 75 cubic meters per second of floodwater to pass through, with the rest of the floodwater flowing into the flood diversion canal to avoid breaches downstream. Embankments were also built on both sides of the flood diversion canal to prevent flooding over the banks. In peacetime, water can also be diverted to irrigate 50,000 mu of land. A small hydroelectric power station was also built by raising the water level at the gate, which can supply electricity for rural rice milling and rice pounding. A pumping station was established in Zhao Lizhuang to use the water of the Mang River for irrigation, which can irrigate 7,000 to 10,000 mu of land. A small hydroelectric power station was built near Jiyuan County, supplying urban lighting and will be able to transmit electricity soon.

In low-lying and flood-prone areas, the method of ditch and platform fields is adopted to overcome waterlogging disasters. The ditches of the ditch and platform fields can store and drain water, and the ditches are equipped with gate panels to control the water flow. If there is too much rainwater, it is drained, and if there is a drought, the gates are closed to lift water for irrigation. Double cropping of wheat and rice is implemented on the platform fields, and lotus is planted in the ditches, which can prevent both drought and waterlogging. By adopting this method, more than 120,000 mu of low-lying waterlogged land has been reduced to more than 35,000 mu.

The county has achieved great results after implementing unified planning and comprehensive management tailored to local conditions. In 1949, the unit area yield of grain was 94 jin, which increased to 137 jin in 1955, an increase of 45.7%. During the same period, the multiple cropping area also expanded by 59.1%, and the total output increased by 131.7%. In the past, the maximum flow of the Mang River reached 1,000 cubic meters per second, and a rainfall of 100 millimeters would cause breaches and disasters. In 1956, under the conditions of a daily rainfall of 120 millimeters, no flood disaster occurred on the Mang River, and the maximum flow was only 70 cubic meters per second.

After inspecting the water conservancy construction in Jiyuan County, I have the following experiences:

As long as the mountainous areas undergo overall planning and comprehensive management, and adopt different effective measures according to different terrains, so that water and soil resources can be fully utilized, there will be great potential for production to be unleashed. Some mountain people and cadres believe that the mountainous areas have no future and cannot build socialism, and these ideas are wrong.

Overall planning is a necessary measure to fully utilize mountainous water and soil resources. The main reason why Jiyuan County has achieved such great results is that it has made outline plans for areas with different terrains throughout the county. The plan not only solves the contradictions between upstream and downstream, but also enables cadres and the masses to have a clear understanding and avoid blindness. Only by carrying out overall planning and comprehensive management in this way can water and soil resources be fully utilized, and the roles of flood prevention, drought prevention, and waterlogging prevention can be fully played.

I believe that Jiyuan County is one of the banners of mountain production and construction. They have not only solved the problem of mountain production, but also taken care of the current interests of the masses. It will also play a great role in managing rivers and eliminating flood disasters. According to their practices, the state has not made a large investment in this regard, mainly relying on the strength of the masses. If every mountainous area does this, the tributaries of large rivers can be basically controlled, and the state can spend less investment on flood prevention. This experience is worth spreading everywhere.

    充分利用山区水土资源的一个榜样
    水利部副部长　何基澧
    1956年12月我视察了河南省济源县的水利建设和水土保持工作。这个县的水利工作几年来做出了很大成绩。现在谈一谈我看到的一些情况和我的一些体会：
    济源县位于河南的西北角，全境横跨太行山南麓，除漭河沿岸有少数平地外，大部为石山林区和丘陵起伏地带。山区面积二百一十多万亩（占全部面积的70％以上），按地形可分为深山区、浅山区和丘陵区。在过去的悠久的岁月里，山区树木被乱砍乱伐；群众为了维持生活，被迫进行陡坡开荒，以致水土大量流失。耕地石厚土薄，产量很低，每亩只能收粮八十斤左右。1942年大旱，虎岭村九十多户就饿死六十多人。山区群众中流行着这样的歌谣：“山上和尚头，沟里没水流，今年盼明年，年年都不收。”
    漭河是县境内的一条大河。河床纵坡大、河床深，洪水来猛去速，最大流量可达一千秒公方，但到下游只能容纳一百秒公方；因此，每年洪水季节，常造成大面积水灾。
    从以上情况可以看出，济源是一个地形复杂、旱涝多灾的地区。
    解放后，党和人民政府特别重视了山区的生产建设工作。这个县的党政领导机关根据“全面规划、综合开发”的方针，对不同地区采取了因地制宜的措施：
    在深山区以林业为主，开展封山育林和植树造林运动。解放后首先封山，并解决林牧矛盾。解决矛盾的办法是“三封三不封”：牧区不封，非牧区封；封树，不封草；封近山，不封远山。等树木成林以后，就可以再开放。这样，既符合群众长远利益，也照顾了群众当前利益。几年来山区共封山育林七十一万多亩，造林十五万亩。目前树已成林，控制了水土流失。如虎岭村在未造林前，大雨时山坡泥土大量冲刷，门前河水变黄，雨后即干。造林以后，现在地内都铺着一尺左右深的树叶和草，雨后河水为淡白，逐渐变清，河内也常年有水。群众说现在是“下雨三天不见水，雨后多日水长流”。植树造林也结合了群众利益。如李八庄乡由1949年到今植树造林三万四千多亩，1955年采伐坑木、椽材和树种共收入二万多元，相当于农业收入的18％。
    山沟修谷坊是蓄水保土淤地增加农业收入的有效办法。解放以来，这个县共修谷坊淤地约五千亩，仅虎岭一个行政村六十二户就拦沟筑坝三百五十道，总长达五千二百余丈。群众总结这样做有四大好处：拦泥、蓄水、保肥和扩大耕地面积。1952年农民任玉山在门边的一条土沟中筑一条坝淤地二亩，一年就收小麦八百斤。群众反映：“闸沟地，粮食屯，保持了水土，还增加了收入，真是一举两得。”
    山区丘陵修建小型水库，变水害为水利。这个县在山区丘陵区有泉水的沟内，结合水土保持先后共修建了七十座小水库，这些水库的坝高都在十到十七公尺，库容量二十万公方，最大的到二百万公方。据我了解，这些水库主要是依靠群众修筑的，全县1956年春共修了六十三座水库，国家只补助材料费四万五千元，每座只合七百十四元。水库做得也很合规格，反滤层、溢洪道、泄水涵洞应有尽有，经过洪水考验并没有冲垮。水库上边结合了封山造林和修筑谷坊工程，所以水库淤积很少，都是清水。群众利用清水通过泄水涵洞浇灌了高地，七十座水库共蓄水六百多万公方，浇地八万多亩，可控制流域面积约四百二十多平方公里的洪水，不但结合灌溉也起了防洪作用。群众说：“小水库是山地宝，又抗旱又防涝。”
    这些水库的技术力量是如何得到的呢？我问了这个县的负责同志，他们说：全县只有三个技术员，都在重点工程上，工程开始时，抽调了各地农民二百余人实际参加施工，完工后他们都学会一套本领，回去后便热火朝天地干起来了。
    在丘陵干旱地区为了保证山地增产，采取里切外垫、起高垫低的办法修梯田。梯田里稍低，外较高，另根据地块大小，中间再加上土垅道，使水流入地后，小则蓄，大则环绕而出，泥沙淤地。这样作可起到“块块蓄水，节节拦泥”的作用。群众总结出来了它的三大好处：泥沙不下山，减少下游淤塞；淤地保墒，抗旱防涝；土地由瘦变肥。如李八庄乡任玉山加工的地比不加工的每亩增产四十斤。几年来这个县共修堎垒堰约六万道（土地约十万亩）。为了拦蓄洪水，在有洪水来源，周围没树又不影响生产和交通的沟道两侧挖水窖，一个窖可蓄水六百到一千担，能抗旱保苗五亩到十亩。如庚章乡是干旱地区，过去群众吃水都很困难，1953年打了水窖二百九十一个，1954年每户都种上了三分菜，在1955年抗旱点种玉米九百九十五亩。
    在平原地区，充分利用水利资源发电灌溉。在谷旦修了一个分洪灌溉节制闸，只准洪水通过七十五秒公方，其余的洪水流入分洪渠，避免下游决口；并在分洪渠两边修堤，防止洪水越堤漫淹。平时还可引水灌溉五万亩土地。又利用闸口抬高水位，建造小型水电站一座，可供应乡村用电磨米打稻。在赵李庄建立抽水站一处，利用漭河水进行灌溉，可以浇地七千到一万亩。在济源县城附近建立了一个小型水电站，供应城市照明，最近即可送电。
    在低洼易涝地区，采用沟洫台田的办法战胜了内涝灾害。沟洫台田的沟能蓄水能排水，沟内设有闸板控制水流，雨水多了就排，旱的时候就闭闸提水灌溉。台田实行麦稻连作，沟内种藕，既能防旱，又能防涝。采用这个办法，使十二万余亩低洼积水地已减少到三万五千多亩。
    全县因地制宜、统一规划、全面治理以后，已取得很大效果。1949年粮食单位面积产量为九十四斤，1955年增至一百三十七斤，提高45.7％。同一期间，复播面积也扩大了59.1％，总产量增长了131.7％。漭河过去最大流量曾达一千秒公方，一百公厘雨量就要决口闹灾。1956年，在日雨量一百二十公厘的情况下，漭河未发生洪水灾害，最大流量仅七十秒公方。
    视察济源县的水利建设以后，我有以下几点体会：
    山区只要经过全面规划、综合治理，根据不同地形，采取不同的有效措施，使水土资源得到充分利用，就会有很大的生产潜力发挥出来。有些山区群众和干部认为山区没前途，建设不成社会主义，这种想法都是不对的。
    全面规划是充分利用山区水土资源的必要措施。济源县能取得这样大的成绩，主要原因是对全县不同地形的地区做了轮廓规划；规划不但解决了上下游的矛盾，也能使干部和群众心中有数，避免盲目性。只有这样进行全面规划、综合治理，才能充分利用水土资源，充分发挥防洪、防旱、防涝的作用。
    我认为济源县是山区生产建设的旗帜之一。他们不仅解决了山区生产问题，照顾了群众当前利益；对治理江河消除洪水灾害也会起很大作用。按照他们的做法，国家在这方面并没有付出很大的投资，主要依靠了群众的力量。如果每个山区都这样做，则大江大河的支流洪水可以基本上得到控制，国家可以花费较少的投资用在防洪上。这个经验值得在各地传播。
