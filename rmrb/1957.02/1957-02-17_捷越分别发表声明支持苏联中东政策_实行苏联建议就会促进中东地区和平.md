Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 16th: The Czechoslovak government issued a statement on February 15th regarding the situation in the Near and Middle East, announcing its full support for the proposals recently put forward by the Soviet government in its notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. The statement said that the Soviet government's proposal fully conforms to the interests of the people of the Near and Middle East countries. If this proposal is implemented, it will promote peace in the region, thereby promoting the cause of peace throughout the world.

The statement said that after stopping the aggression against Egypt, a real possibility has emerged for guaranteeing peace and resolving problems satisfactorily in the Near and Middle East. However, contrary to the hopes and wishes of the people of all countries, the situation has deteriorated again, and peace in the region has been threatened, especially because one country wants to use its armed forces to interfere in the internal affairs of Near and Middle Eastern countries without the consent of the United Nations.

The statement then pointed out that the Czechoslovak government maintains friendly relations with the countries of the Near and Middle East, and it is determined to further develop this relationship in the spirit of the United Nations Charter.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 16th: A statement issued on February 15th by Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, was released in Hanoi today. The statement supports the basic principles proposed by the Soviet Union to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France regarding guaranteeing peace and security in the Near and Middle East and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in this region.

The statement said that the Anglo-French military aggression against Egypt and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" have already caused tension in the Near and Middle East and threatened the security of the countries in this region and world peace. Under these circumstances, the proposals put forward by the Soviet government on February 11th are "a huge contribution to guaranteeing stable and lasting peace in the Near and Middle East."

The statement pointed out that after the Soviet Union and China issued a joint statement on January 19th, the Soviet government once again put forward proposals on the Middle East issue, which proves that the Soviet Union always respects the sovereignty and independence of the countries in the Near and Middle East and does not interfere in the internal affairs of these countries. In the joint statement, the Soviet Union and China expressed "readiness to continue to provide the necessary support to the people of the Near and Middle East countries to stop aggression and interference against countries in this region."

The statement by the Vietnamese Foreign Minister also said that the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly support the heroic struggle of the people of the Near and Middle East countries to win and maintain national independence and national sovereignty and to oppose all imperialist interference and aggressive conspiracies.

    捷越分别发表声明支持苏联中东政策
    实行苏联建议就会促进中东地区和平
    新华社布拉格16日电　捷克斯洛伐克政府15日就中近东局势发表声明，宣布完全支持苏联政府最近在对美、英、法三国政府的照会中提出的建议。声明说，苏联政府的这一建议完全符合中近东各国人民的利益，如果实行这个建议，那就会促进这个地区的和平，从而促进全世界的和平事业。
    声明说，在制止对埃及的侵略以后，出现了在中近东保证和平和圆满解决问题的真正可能性。然而，同各国人民的希望和愿望相反，局势又恶化了，并且这个地区的和平又遭到了威胁，特别是由于有一个国家想不得到联合国的同意就使用它的武装部队来干涉中近东国家的内政。
    声明接着指出，捷克斯洛伐克政府和中近东国家保持着友好关系，它决心按照联合国宪章的精神进一步发展这种关系。
    新华社河内16日电　今天在河内公布了越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在15日发表的声明，声明支持苏联向美、英、法三国政府提出的关于保障中近东和平和安全以及不干涉这一地区各国内政的基本原则。
    声明说，英、法对埃及的军事侵略和“艾森豪威尔主义”已经在中近东引起紧张局势并且威胁着这一地区国家的安全和世界和平。在这种情况下，苏联政府在2月11日提出的建议是“对保证中近东的稳固和持久和平的一个巨大的贡献”。
    声明指出，在苏联和中国1月19日发表联合声明以后，苏联政府又对中近东问题提出建议，这证明苏联永远尊重中近东各国的主权和独立，不干涉这些国家的内政。在联合声明中，苏联和中国表示“准备继续给予中近东各国人民必要的支持，以制止对这个地区国家的侵略和干涉”。
    越南外交部长的声明还说，越南民主共和国政府和人民热烈支持中近东各国人民为争取并保持民族独立和国家主权、为反对帝国主义的一切干涉和侵略阴谋而进行的英勇斗争。
