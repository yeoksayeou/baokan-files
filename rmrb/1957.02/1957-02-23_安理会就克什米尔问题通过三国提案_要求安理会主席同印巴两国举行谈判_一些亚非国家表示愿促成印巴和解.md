Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 22nd: The United Nations Security Council concluded its discussion on the Kashmir issue on the 21st. The meeting passed a proposal by the United States, Britain, and Australia, requesting the President of the Security Council, Swedish representative Jarring, taking into account the Security Council's previous resolutions and the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan's previous resolutions, to study with the governments of India and Pakistan any suggestions he deems may contribute to the resolution of this dispute, and to visit India and Pakistan for this purpose, and to submit a report to the Security Council no later than April 15, 1957.

In the vote, ten votes were in favor, none against, and the Soviet Union abstained.

Soviet representative Sobolev, in explaining the vote, said that the Soviet Union believed that the aspect of the three-country proposal that authorized the Council President to negotiate with India and Pakistan was acceptable. This proposal was better than the four-country proposal vetoed by the Soviet Union on the 20th (the rejected proposal advocated considering sending a United Nations emergency force to Kashmir to achieve the "demilitarization" of the region).

Sobolev said that the Soviet Union disagreed with the proposal because it referred to the Council's past resolutions, which could become obstacles to the Council President's negotiations.

Sobolev concluded by saying that the Soviet Union sincerely hoped that the negotiations would produce positive results and lead to the resumption of direct negotiations between the parties concerned.

Indian representative Menon, in his speech, expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal's reference to the Council's past resolutions and reiterated India's claims on the Kashmir issue. He said that he would submit the resolution passed by the Council to his government, and India's new cabinet would consider the resolution in March after the elections in India.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, February 22nd: Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike announced on the 21st that he had written to countries attending the Bandung Conference to mediate a peaceful resolution to the Kashmir issue and had received very favorable replies from many of them.

Bandaranaike said at a press conference that he had received replies from the Philippines, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Nepal, among others.

Bandaranaike also read out certain passages from the reply letters to him from Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy. Bandaranaike had earlier called on India and Pakistan to strive for a peaceful resolution to the Kashmir issue.

Nehru said in his letter: "We have always been willing to discuss this issue with the Government of Pakistan." He added: "But we cannot accept in negotiations anything that directly or indirectly damages our reputation and ignores the fact that we are victims of aggression."

Suhrawardy's reply stated: "I do not believe that holding further direct negotiations is useful. I can only hope that you will do your best to persuade India to be a faithful member of the United Nations."

    安理会就克什米尔问题通过三国提案
    要求安理会主席同印巴两国举行谈判
    一些亚非国家表示愿促成印巴和解
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会21日结束了克什米尔问题的讨论。会议通过了美国、英国和澳大利亚的一项提案，这个提案要求安全理事会主席、瑞典代表雅林在注意到安全理事会以前的决议和联合国印度及巴基斯坦委员会以前的决议的情况下，同印度和巴基斯坦政府一起研究任何他认为可能对于这一争端的解决有所贡献的建议，并为这个目的而访问印度和巴基斯坦，并且不迟于1957年4月15日向安全理事会提出报告。
    在表决时，十票赞成，没有人反对，苏联弃权。
    苏联代表索波列夫在解释投票态度时说，苏联认为，三国提案里授权理事会主席同印度和巴基斯坦谈判，这一点是可以接受的。这个提案比20日苏联否决的四国提案要好一些（被否决的提案主张考虑派遣联合国临时部队去克什米尔以实现这个地区的“非军事化”）。
    索波列夫说，苏联不同意这个提案的地方是，它提到了理事会过去的决议，而这些决议可能变成理事会主席进行谈判的障碍。
    索波列夫最后说，苏联真诚地希望，谈判将会产生积极的结果，并且导致有关双方直接谈判的恢复。
    印度代表梅农在发言中对提案提到理事会过去的决议表示不满，并且重申印度在克什米尔问题上的主张。他说，他将把理事会通过的决议交给他的政府，在印度举行选举后，印度的新内阁将在3月间考虑这个决议。
    新华社22日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克21日宣布，他曾经写信要求出席万隆会议的国家进行斡旋以实现克什米尔问题的和平解决，并且已经从其中许多国家得到了非常有利的答复。
    班达拉奈克在记者招待会上说，他收到了菲律宾、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯、埃塞俄比亚、阿富汗和尼泊尔等国的答复。
    班达拉奈克还宣读了印度总理尼赫鲁和巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底给他的复信中的某些段落。班达拉奈克早些时候曾经呼吁印巴两国争取克什米尔问题的和平解决。
    尼赫鲁在信中说：“我们一直是愿意同巴基斯坦政府讨论这个问题的。”他又说：“但是我们在谈判中不能够接受任何直接或间接有损我们的名誉并无视我们是侵略的受害者这个事实的东西。”
    苏拉瓦底的复信说：“我并不认为，举行进一步的直接谈判是有用处的。我只能希望你尽力劝印度当联合国的忠实的会员国。”
