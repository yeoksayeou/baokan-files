Launch the Masses to Fully Develop the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement
The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Puts Forward Specific Requirements

    (New China Daily Report) The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued specific instructions on how factories and mines should fully develop the increase production and practice economy movement.
    The basic requirements of the Provincial Committee for the movement are: to implement the guiding ideology of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift into the current work; to formulate active and reliable production plans based on the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy and the actual conditions of the unit; to mobilize the masses, tap potential, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of state plans. There should be different specific requirements and priorities for different objects. For example, in local industry, the main focus is to improve product quality, reduce costs, increase variety, and improve enterprise management and technical levels, striving to maintain and exceed the 1956 production plan. The main task of newly established joint state-private factories is to systematically adjust enterprises that were improperly merged during the economic restructuring last year, and to establish and improve various management systems on the original basis according to necessity and possibility. For state-owned factories, the general goal is to improve management and technical levels on the basis of consolidating existing achievements, and to do a good job in the trial production of new products, etc. In terms of capital construction, we should comprehensively consider investment, technical conditions, materials, power, and the balance of various aspects, review plans, and determine projects. For projects that have been determined, we must seize the time to design and construct them in a balanced manner, and save raw materials while ensuring quality. In terms of transportation, we should focus on improving transportation plans, improving the dispatch and use of transportation tools, and fully utilizing the potential of folk transportation tools. In terms of handicrafts, the main tasks are to implement the principles of running cooperatives with diligence and thrift and democracy, improve product quality and service attitude, increase production, increase variety, and continue to adjust the inappropriately concentrated production in cooperatives.
    In terms of approach, first, enhance the awareness of cadres and workers, and clarify the requirements, priorities, and methods of work. Second, in accordance with the spirit of the increase production and practice economy movement, prepare annual, quarterly, and monthly plans, and formulate plans for the movement. Third, mobilize the masses, on the one hand, expand and improve the democratic system of enterprise management and promote the system of employee representative conferences; on the other hand, continue to carry out the advanced producer movement and socialist labor emulation, implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, ensure the completion of production plans, and promote the continuous improvement of technical levels.
    Regarding the principles that must be grasped in the movement, the Provincial Committee pointed out: The first is to continue to implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical in industrial production. We should take into account the actual situation, comprehensively consider the connections between each other, and focus on implementation. We must strive to increase production where raw materials are guaranteed, products have sales, and the balance of electricity is not affected. All enterprises should promote good quality and economy. Saving raw materials, materials, tools, and using substitutes must be carried out on the premise of ensuring quality and safe production. Safe production is the greatest saving, and money that must be used to ensure safe production and improve working conditions cannot be unilaterally saved. Increasing production and practicing economy should be combined with scientific and technological research and trial production of new products, and the progress of technical research work should not be affected by economy. We must always care about the welfare of employees, and the necessary improvement of employee life and welfare should still be carried out gradually on the basis of production development. In short, we should distinguish between reasonable expenses and waste, and distinguish between reasonable reserves and stockpiled materials.
    Other issues, such as the issue of raw materials and the streamlining of enterprise management organizations, the instructions also explained the principles that should be followed.

    发动群众全面开展增产节约运动
    中共江苏省委提出具体要求
    本报讯　据新华日报消息：中共江苏省委员会最近对于厂矿企业如何全面地开展增产节约运动的问题专门作了指示。
    省委对运动的基本要求是：把勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的指导思想，贯彻到当前各项工作中去；根据增产节约的精神和本单位的实际情况，制定积极可靠的生产计划；发动群众，挖掘潜力，保证完成和超额完成国家计划。对不同的对象，要有不同的具体要求和重点。如在地方工业方面，主要是提高产品质量，降低成本，增加花色品种，提高企业管理水平、技术水平，力争保持和超过1956年的生产计划。新公私合营厂主要是有计划地调整去年经济改组中并得不适当的企业，在原有基础上，按照必要与可能，建立和健全各项管理制度；在国营工厂方面，一般是在巩固原有成绩的基础上提高管理水平、技术水平，搞好新产品的试制等。在基本建设方面，应该从投资、技术条件、材料、动力和各方面的平衡等问题进行通盘考虑，审查计划，确定项目；对已确定的项目，要抓紧及时设计和施工，做到均衡生产，并在保证质量的条件下节约原材料。在交通运输方面，着重搞好运输计划，改进交通工具的调度与使用，充分发挥民间交通工具的潜力。在手工业方面，主要是贯彻勤俭办社、民主办社的方针，提高产品质量和改善服务态度，增加生产，增加花色品种，继续调整办社中不适当的集中生产的部分。
    在做法上，首先，提高干部和职工群众的自觉，明确工作的要求、重点和做法。其次，根据增产节约运动的精神，编好年度、季度、月度计划，制定运动的方案。第三，发动群众，一方面扩大与健全企业管理的民主制度，推行职工代表大会制度；一方面继续开展先进生产者运动和社会主义劳动竞赛，贯彻增产节约精神，保证生产计划的完成和推动技术水平的不断提高。
    关于运动中必须掌握的原则，省委指出：首先是对于继续在工业生产中执行多、快、好、省的方针。应当照顾实际情况，既要全面地照顾彼此间的联系，又要有重点地贯彻执行。在原料有保证、产品有销路、又不影响电力平衡的必须力争增产。所有企业都应当提倡好和省。节约原材料、机物料、工具和利用代用品，必须在保证质量和安全生产的前提下进行。安全生产是最大的节约，必须用于保证安全生产、改善劳动条件的钱是不能片面加以节约的。增产节约应当与科学技术研究、新产品试制相结合，不能因节约而影响技术研究工作的进行。必须经常关心职工福利，在生产发展的基础上，对职工生活福利的必要改善，仍应逐步地进行。总之，应当把合理开支与浪费加以区别，把合理储备与积压物资加以区别。
    其他如关于原材料的问题，以及企业管理机构的精简问题，指示中都对应遵守的原则作了说明。
