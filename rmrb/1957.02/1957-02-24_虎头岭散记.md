Random Notes on Tiger Head Ridge
Xu Xuezeng

I was going to Tiger Head Ridge, and the leaders of the unit specially sent a small boat to take me. The small boat left the harbor, and in front of us was a vast ocean. Before long, we saw Tiger Head Ridge.

It is said that the name Tiger Head Ridge did not exist on maps before. Later, people could not climb it and became afraid of it, so they called it that. Since ancient times, there has been no place to walk on Tiger Head Ridge. Guarding this hilltop is a naval observation and communication station of the People's Liberation Army. They have been on the mountain for five years, and I heard that there are soldiers from five ethnic groups: Han, Manchu, Li, Miao, and Hui. They knew I was coming from the telephone and were afraid I would get lost, so they specially sent the medic, Comrade Su Shaobo, down the mountain to meet me.

In fact, I had already found someone to guide me. As soon as I got off the boat, I met seven young women fetching water by the well at the foot of the mountain. Among them were Han, Li, and Miao people. I asked them for directions, and they said they were going to the observation and communication station to deliver water, "Let's go together!"

Water is the most scarce thing for the troops stationed on this hilltop. In order to save water, the soldiers "used one water three times" (washing face - washing clothes - washing feet) and "used one water four times" (washing rice - washing pots - washing dishes - feeding pigs). This matter quickly spread among the local people, and young men and women from more than thirty miles away automatically ran to help carry water. As the troops had been stationed here for a long time, they simply fixed a few water carriers and paid them the wages they deserved. Now, the seven strong young women in front of me are the ones who carry water for the troops on the mountain.

I talked to the medic who came down to meet me about the water situation. He said, "We are building a road, and soon cars will be able to reach the top of the mountain. The higher authorities have already approved a water truck for us, and then there will be no shortage of water."

Further up, I saw many soldiers building roads, and several civilian workers splitting rocks. Along the way, dense forests blocked my view. When I reached the top of the mountain, I turned around and saw how vast it was! The sea was right at my feet.

I sat down to rest next to the kitchen, and several male and female civilian workers beside me were digging a cistern with clanging sounds. The station chief and the political instructor of the observation and communication station walked towards me smiling from the command post above. The station chief's name was Guo Lianchun, and the political instructor's name was Song Xiliang. Both were only twenty-seven years old, enlisted in the army in the same year, and both were from Heilongjiang. They came from the northernmost part of the motherland to the South China Sea and loved this place as much as they loved their hometown. In their spare time, they used the method of catching wild chickens by the Xingkai Lake to catch wild chickens on the mountain, and sometimes they threw pebbles into the sea with the same interest as skimming stones on the Songhua River. We talked about some everyday things, and then they took me to visit the soldiers' dormitories. On the way, the station chief happily said to me: "The soldiers are living in new tile-roofed houses! Tent - thatched shed - plank house - tile-roofed house is the development process of the troops living on the mountain." The political instructor said, "Now everyone has a house to live in."

When the troops first arrived here, they could not even find a flat piece of ground the size of a tent; the soldiers had to sleep in the woods. Now that there are houses, the living conditions are still difficult. Sometimes, when soldiers are lying in bed, small snakes crawl on the roof beams. Sometimes, after the soldiers have aired their quilts and swept the beds, a nest of small ants will live under the mattress the next day. Sometimes, when it rains heavily, the room is full of water, and shoes float like small boats from under the bed to the door. The next morning, the soldiers have to go down the mountain to find their shoes. Although there are tile-roofed houses now, some people still sleep in wooden houses, and the station chief and political instructor still live in thatched sheds.

Most of the residents within a hundred miles of this area are Li people. The political instructor said: "Although the minority nationalities do not understand our language, their hearts are very real. Take building houses as an example! A few months ago, we wanted to build two thatched houses, but we didn't have any coconut leaves (coconut leaves are woven and used as walls for thatched houses locally). When the Li people in Liudao Township, eighteen miles away, found out, they held a meeting, and everyone worked together to quickly weave more than 340 pieces, loaded them on boats, and sent them to us to build four houses. Our quartermaster calculated the price according to the market price and went to Liudao Township to send money. The villagers refused to take it no matter what we said. The quartermaster had to bring it back. I am the political instructor, so I cannot violate the mass discipline. I went there myself, but the villagers still refused. They said that the troops helped them fight drought and dug five wells, and they have not yet repaid us."

After lunch, we took a walk around the barracks. The barracks were surrounded by wild flowers with five petals, some red and some white. Because it blooms in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the soldiers call it "Four Seasons Flower." The station chief and the political instructor took me a few steps forward and pointed to show me: "This is wild cotton." I looked at the heavy flower peaches, which were not much smaller than domestic cotton peaches. "This is wild papaya. Last year, we couldn't go down the mountain because of the typhoon, so we ate it." "Look at the mountain lentils, they often bloom and bear beans, and they taste the same as the lentils we buy when stir-fried." The political instructor said, "There are also mountain peppers. Don't look at them being less than half an inch long, but they are very spicy. Pick a few for you to try at dinner."

I never thought that the barren mountain they lived on was actually a treasure land. No wonder the officers and soldiers fell in love with it.

After a while, the political instructor took me to see the fortifications in front. Although the road was difficult to climb, we did not feel tired while talking, and we quickly reached the front line. After resting for a while, the station chief and political instructor took me to visit the observation post. This is a steel and concrete structure. When the comrades of the observation and communication station first came here, the soldiers worked by erecting two wooden poles on a large tree nearby, getting rained on and unable to stand firm in the wind. The big tree later withered and was blown down by the wind, and it is still lying on the top of the mountain.

We went up to the observation post, and two young signal soldiers stood up to greet us. These two signal soldiers, one named Zhou Zhanqing and the other named Zhang Tianli, although they are new soldiers, their academic performance is not bad. They get all fives and fours in every test and have never made an accident or mistake in their work. During the day, Zhou Zhanqing can judge the type of ship from the masts and chimneys in the distance, and at night he can distinguish the size of the target based on the lights he finds. Zhang Tianli is also proficient in various techniques.

Before long, a black dot appeared on the distant sea. The signal soldiers determined that it was a British merchant ship coming to Yulin Port to load goods, so they raised their signal flags and sent it the designated anchorage signal. After receiving the signal, the ship slowly sailed into the designated position and dropped anchor with a splash.

The station chief said: "Our task seems simple, but it is actually very heavy. We have to navigate for our own naval vessels, and we have to send and receive signals to merchant ships coming and going from various countries. More importantly, we have to observe and report the enemy's naval activities at sea. It looks calm now, but you never know when something will happen. If we have anything to be proud of, it is because we are signal soldiers standing on the south gate of the motherland."

When the sun set, the soldiers who had been working hard all day came to the small square they had opened up to lift weights, sing, and play around. Originally, there was a basketball hoop in this square, but it was blown away by the typhoon and now only two broken iron rings remain. Someone found a large rope and invited the civilian workers who were hammering stones to play tug-of-war. The civilian workers couldn't beat the soldiers, and someone fell to the ground, making everyone laugh.

In the evening, the soldiers held a weekend party and insisted that I talk about the construction situation in the rear. Although this party was not large, it had many programs. Henan Opera, Shandong Fast Talk, Hubei Minor Tune, Hunan Folk Song, Shanghai Kung Fu, and Hainan Island Dance were all available. The medic who came down to meet me even "beat" the drums with his mouth and sang a section of Peking Opera. Finally, at everyone's request, I had to talk about the one and a half points of the motherland's construction that I knew. Whether it was about Beijing, Chairman Mao, Angang Steel, or the First Automobile Factory, the soldiers listened attentively. From these incomplete introductions, they saw the achievements of the cause they were defending.

    虎头岭散记
    徐学增
    我要去虎头岭，部队领导上特别派了一只小艇送我。小艇出了港口，面前是一片汪洋大海，没走多久就看见了虎头岭。
    据说，从前地图上没有虎头岭这个名字，后来人们攀登不上，见它生畏，才这样叫起来的。虎头岭自古以来，就没有可以走人的地方。驻守在这个山顶上的是人民海军某部的一个观通站，他们上山五年了，听说里面有汉、满、黎、苗、回五个民族的战士。他们从电话上知道我来了，怕我迷了路，特地派卫生员粟少伯同志下山来接我。
    其实，我已经找到了带路的人。我一下船，在海边山脚下的井旁，遇到七个打水的年轻妇女。她们中间有汉族人、黎族人，还有苗族人。我向她们问路，她们说她们就要到观通站去送水，“一块走吧！”
    水，是驻守在这个山头上的部队所最缺的东西。战士们为了节约用水，便“一水三用”（洗脸—洗衣—洗脚）和“一水四用”（洗米—刷锅—洗碗—喂猪）。这件事情很快地在当地人民中间传开了，三十里以外的一些青年男女便自动地跑来帮着挑水。部队守卫在这里日久天长，索性就固定了几个挑水的人，付给她们应得的工钱。现在我面前这七位结实的青年妇女，就是给山上部队挑水的。
    我和下山接我的卫生员谈起水的事。他说：“我们正在修公路，不久汽车就可通到山顶上。上级已经批给了我们一辆载水汽车，那时就不会缺水了。”
    再往上走，见许多战士在开公路，还有几个民工在破山劈石。一路上，密林遮住了我的视线。走到山顶，转眼一看，多辽阔啊！大海就在脚底下。
    我坐在伙房旁边休息，身旁的几个男女民工正在叮当地挖山修储水池。观通站站长和指导员从上面指挥所里笑嘻嘻地朝着我走过来。站长叫郭连春，指导员叫宋希良，两个人都才二十七岁，同一年参的军，都是黑龙江人。他们从祖国的最北方来到了祖国的南海边，爱这里如同爱自己的家乡。他们在空隙时间用在兴凯湖边捉野鸡的方法到山上去捉野鸡，有时候带着用石子在松花江上甩水波的兴趣，把石片投向大海。我们说了些家常话，他俩便带我去参观战士宿舍。路上，站长高兴地对我说：“战士们住上了新瓦房！帐篷——草棚——板屋——瓦房，是山上部队居住的发展过程。”指导员说：“现在大家都有房子住了。”
    部队刚到这里的时候，连一块帐篷大小的平地也找不到；战士们只好睡在树林里。现在有了房子，生活条件仍然是艰苦的。有时战士躺在床上，小花蛇就爬在屋梁上。有时候，战士们晒了被子扫了铺，第二天垫被下面就住上了一窝小蚂蚁。有时大雨来了，满房是水，鞋子像小船似地从床下漂出门口，第二天早上，战士们还要下山去找鞋。现在虽说有了瓦房，有些人还是睡在木板房子里，站长和指导员住的还是草棚。
    这一带百里之内的居民，大都是黎族人。指导员说：“少数民族虽讲话不懂，可是他们的心可实在啦。就拿盖房子来说吧！前几个月，我们要盖两座草房，没有椰子片（椰子片是用椰子叶编制的，当地盖草房，大都用它作墙壁），山下十八里外的六道乡的黎族老乡知道了，开了个会，大家一齐动手，很快编了三百四十多片，用船装着送来，供我们盖了四间房子。我们的给养员根据市价算了算，到六道乡去送钱。老乡说什么也不要。给养员只好又拿回来。我是指导员，可不能违犯群众纪律。我亲自跑去了，老乡们还是不要。说什么部队帮助他们抗旱挖了五口井，到现在还没有报答我们呢。”
    吃了中饭，我们在营房旁边散步。营房周围处处盛开着五个瓣儿的野花，有红的，有白的。因为它春夏秋冬都开放，战士们叫它“四季花”。站长和指导员带我往前走了几步，指给我看：“这是野棉花。”我一看累累的花桃比家棉桃小不了多少。“这是野木瓜。去年刮台风下不了山，我们就是吃的它。”“你看山扁豆，经常开花结豆，炒着吃和买来的扁豆一个味。”指导员说：“还有山辣椒，别看它长的不到五分长，可辣啦，晚饭时摘几个你尝尝。”
    真没想到，他们住的这座荒山原来是宝地。怪不得官兵们爱上了它。
    过了一会，指导员又带我到前面去看工事。虽然攀木登石道路难走，但是说着话不觉累，很快就到了前沿。休息了一会，站长和指导员又带我去参观了望台。这是一座钢骨水泥的建筑物。观通站的同志们刚来这里的时候，战士们是在附近一棵大树上架了两根木头进行工作的，下雨挨淋，刮风立不住脚跟。这棵大树后来枯干得被风刮倒了，至今还躺在山头上。
    我们走上了望台，两个年轻的信号兵迎面朝我们站起来。这两个信号兵，一个叫周占清，一个叫张天理。两个虽是新战士，但学习成绩可不坏，每次测验全是五分和四分，在工作中从来没出过事故和差错。周占清白天能从远处的桅杆、烟囱判断舰艇的类型，晚上能根据发现的灯光区别目标大小。张天理的各种技术也很熟练。
    不一会，在很远的海面上出现了一个黑点。信号兵断定是一只来榆林港装运货物的英国商船，他们便举起手旗，发出了给它指定的锚位信号。轮船接到信号后，徐徐驶进指定位置，哗哗地抛锚了。
    站长说：“我们的任务，看起来很简单，实际上很繁重。我们要给自己海军的舰艇导航，要与各国来往的商船收发信号。更重要的是观察、通报敌人舰艇在海上的活动情况。现在看起来风平浪静，可是说不定什么时候就会有情况。如果说我们有值得骄傲的地方，那就是因为我们是一个站在祖国南大门上的信号兵。”
    当太阳西下的时候，劳累了一天的战士们来到自己开辟的小广场上，举重、唱歌、闹着玩。本来这广场上还有个篮球架，被台风刮得现在只剩下了两个破铁环。不知谁找到根大绳子，把打石头的民工邀来拔河。民工拔不过战士，有人倒在地上，惹得大家哈哈笑。
    晚上，战士们举行周末晚会，一定要我去谈谈后方的建设情况。这个晚会，别看场面不大，节目可不少。河南梆子、山东快书、湖北小调、湖南民歌、上海的拳术、海南岛的舞蹈，样样俱全。下山去迎我的那个卫生员，还自己用嘴“敲打”着锣鼓唱了一段京戏。最后，在大家的要求下，我不得不把自己知道的一星半点祖国建设的情况谈了谈。不管是讲北京、讲毛主席，还是讲鞍钢、讲第一汽车厂，战士们都留心静听。他们从这些不全面的介绍中看到了他们所保卫着的事业的成就。
