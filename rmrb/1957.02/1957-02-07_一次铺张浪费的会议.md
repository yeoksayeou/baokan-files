    A Wasteful Meeting
    Bai Liao, Guang Mao
    There was such a meeting, it was very important, and it should have been held in a grand manner. But grand is not equal to extravagance. Unfortunately, this meeting was excessively extravagant.
    This meeting was the First National Congress of Activists for Popularizing Science and Technology among Workers, held in Beijing last October. The conference opened on October 29, but the preparatory committee established an office as early as June to begin preparations. However, during the preparation period, some staff members spent their office hours reading novels, playing chess, and playing cards. This indicates that there was a considerable waste of manpower. The waste of materials at this meeting was also astonishing. During the preparation period, the secretariat published fifteen or sixteen issues of working briefs on glazed printing paper. However, the content was unimportant reports of press conferences, detailed reports of the scientific and technological publicity activities carried out by central news organizations, and the main points of publicity reports for the briefs, etc. The paper used for printing conference documents and materials, newsprint alone, amounted to ten tons. If this newsprint were used to print the recently published first volume of Lu Xun's Complete Works (three hundred sheets), more than sixteen thousand six hundred and sixty copies could be printed. Other office supplies were also prepared in excessive quantities. After the meeting ended, the remaining supplies were used for another meeting with a larger attendance, and there would still be a surplus. Even the high-quality scented soap for washing hands in the conference venue's restrooms amounted to more than ten bars.
    During the seven-day meeting, the representatives and staff were invited to watch Peking opera, Soviet circus performances, dramas, and concerts. A week after the meeting closed, the staff were again invited to watch the drama "Second Love."
    Among the "souvenirs" received by the delegates at this conference, in addition to commemorative badges, there was also a set of photographs about the conference and a specially customized cowhide briefcase with gold lettering from Shanghai. Even some staff members and "related units" received this type of briefcase.
    Of course, many meetings were not so extravagant, but the idea of ​​making meetings grand by means of extravagance is quite common. We must oppose this wasteful trend.

    一次铺张浪费的会议	白辽　广袤
    有这样一次会议，它很重要，它应该开得隆重。但隆重不等于铺张，遗憾的是这次会议过分地铺张了。
    这次会议就是去年10月在北京召开的全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会。这次会议于10月29日开幕，而筹备委员会远在6月就组成办公室，开始了筹备事宜。但是在筹备期间，有些工作人员曾经用看小说、下棋、打扑克来消磨办公时间。说明这中间有不少浪费人力的现象。这次会议物资的浪费也是惊人的。秘书处在筹备期间就用道林纸出版了十五、六期工作简报，它的内容却是并不紧要的记者招待会的报道，中央各新闻单位已开展科学技术宣传活动的详细报道以及简报的宣传报道要点等等。印刷大会文件、资料等的纸张，仅新闻纸一项即达十吨。如果把这些新闻纸印成最近出版的鲁迅全集第一卷（三百张），可印一万六千六百六十多册。其它办公用品也准备得太多，会议结束时剩下的，供给另一次出席人数更多的会议使用以后还会有剩余。放在大会会场厕所里供洗手用的上等香皂，竟有十块之多。
    在七天的会议期间，请代表们和工作人员观赏了京剧、苏联马戏、话剧、音乐会等，在会议闭幕一星期以后，又请工作人员们观赏了话剧“第二次爱情”。
    这次大会的代表所领受的“纪念品”中，除了纪念章，还有一套关于这次大会情况的照片和一个烫着金字的在上海特别定制的牛皮皮包。甚至一部分工作人员和“有关单位”也得到了这种皮包。
    当然，有不少会议并没有这样铺张，但是企图用铺张的办法把会议开得隆重的想法却是相当普遍的。我们要反对这种铺张浪费的风气。
