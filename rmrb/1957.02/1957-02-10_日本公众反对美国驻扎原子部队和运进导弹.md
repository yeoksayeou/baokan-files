Xinhua News Agency, February 9th, Tokyo: TASS Tokyo, February 8th: Professor Giichiro Hirano, Director-General of the Japan Peace Committee, told a TASS reporter that the proposal of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the U.S. intention to deploy atomic weapons in Japan and other countries are threats to peace and attempts to revive the Cold War. He said that the atomic base encirclement that the United States has established around the Soviet Union is also used to suppress the national liberation movements of the Asian people.

Professor Giichiro Hirano continued, saying that the Japanese people attach great importance to the recent Soviet statement warning against the U.S. attempt to establish special atomic bases on the territory of other countries. At present, the Japanese people are doing everything possible to smash the plans of the war instigators. The spearhead of the Japanese people's struggle is aimed at abolishing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which is the root of all disasters. Professor Giichiro Hirano emphasized that more than 30 million people in Japan have signed petitions demanding the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which clearly demonstrates the beliefs and will of the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, February 9th, Tokyo: Representatives of four youth and women's organizations, including the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation, visited Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida at the Diet today and submitted a resolution opposing the stationing of U.S. atomic forces in Japan.

The resolution also opposes turning Okinawa into an atomic base, opposes the British testing of nuclear weapons on Christmas Island, and demands that the government refuse the U.S. to import missiles into Japan.

The four groups also decided to mobilize people to protest at the U.S. Embassy on the 11th.

    日本公众反对美国驻扎原子部队和运进导弹
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社东京8日讯：日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎教授对塔斯社记者发表谈话说，“艾森豪威尔主义”的提出，以及美国打算在日本和其它国家配置原子武器，这些恢复冷战的企图，都是对和平的威胁。他说，美国在苏联周围建立的原子基地包围圈也是用来镇压亚洲人民民族解放运动的。
    平野义太郎教授继续说，日本人民十分重视不久前苏联发表的警告美国企图在别国领土上建立专门的原子基地的声明，目前日本人民正在尽一切力量来粉碎战争挑拨者的计划。日本人民斗争的锋芒针对着废除美日“安全条约”，这个条约是一切灾祸的根源。平野义太郎教授着重指出，日本曾经有三千多万人签名要求禁止核子武器，这明显地表现了日本人民的信念和意志。
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：全日本学生自治会总联合会等四个青年、妇女团体的代表今天到国会访问内阁官房长官石田博英，递交了反对美国原子部队驻扎日本的决议。
    这个决议还反对把冲绳岛变成原子基地，反对英国在圣诞岛试验核子武器，并且要求政府拒绝美国把导弹运进日本。
    这四个团体还决定在11日动员人民到美国大使馆去提出抗议。
