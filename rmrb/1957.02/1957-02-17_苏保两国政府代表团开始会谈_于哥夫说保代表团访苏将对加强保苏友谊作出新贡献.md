    The Soviet side participating in the talks included: Bulganin, Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Saburov, Gromyko, and Prikhodov.
    The Bulgarian side participating in the talks included: Yugov, Zhivkov, Janko, Traikov, Damyano, Chervenkov, Staykov, Lukanov, and Gerasimov.
    The talks will continue.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 16th: The Bulgarian government delegation, led by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Yugov, arrived in Moscow by plane on the 15th.
    The delegation members included: First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party Zhivkov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Janko, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Secretary of the Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union Traikov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Trade Damyano, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Education and Culture Chervenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party Staykov, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Lukanov. Bulgarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Gerasimov was also a member of the delegation.
    Bulganin, Mikoyan, Saburov, Khrushchev, Furtseva, Soviet ministers, and other government officials were at the airport to welcome the guests.
    Representatives of the working people of Moscow, gathered at the airport, warmly welcomed the Bulgarian guests.
    Yugov delivered a speech at the airport.
    He said that the Bulgarian people and the Soviet people are eternally linked together by an unbreakable friendship. The friendship between the peoples of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union has deep roots. For Bulgarians, friendship with the Soviet Union is precious and sacred. This friendship is a powerful driving force for the socialist development of Bulgaria. Without this friendship, without the unity of the powerful socialist camp countries headed by the great Soviet Union, we could not imagine a free and independent socialist Bulgaria.
    Yugov continued by saying that the friendship and unity of the socialist countries, their peace-loving aspirations, and the peace policy of the Soviet government are, needless to say, disliked by the enemies of peace and socialism. The imperialists are very afraid of the unity and growing strength of the forces of peace and socialism. They are desperately trying to make the international situation tense again, and if possible, they also want to dismantle our friendly and strong socialist family. However, the unity of the socialist countries, the unity of the world's peace forces, is consolidated and unbreakable. Our friendship with the great Soviet Union is consolidated and unbreakable, because this friendship and unity are built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism of equality, mutual respect, mutual assistance, and fraternal cooperation. No dark forces can destroy this unity, friendship, and fraternal cooperation. This friendship and unity is eternal.
    Yugov concluded by saying, we are deeply convinced that our friendly visit will be a new contribution to further consolidating the fraternal friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union and expanding cooperation between the two countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 16th: Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Voroshilov and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin received the Bulgarian government delegation, which is on a friendly visit to Moscow, on the 15th.
    Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko also received the delegation member and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov on the same day.

    苏保两国政府代表团开始会谈
    于哥夫说保代表团访苏将对加强保苏友谊作出新贡献
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联政府代表团同保加利亚政府代表团16日在莫斯科克里姆林宫开始会谈。
    苏联方面参加会谈的有：布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫、米高扬、萨布罗夫、葛罗米柯和普里霍多夫。
    保加利亚方面参加会谈的有：于哥夫、日夫科夫、詹科夫、特莱科夫、达米扬诺夫、契尔文科夫、斯塔伊科夫、卢卡诺夫和格拉西莫夫。
    会谈将继续举行。
    新华社莫斯科16日电　由部长会议主席于哥夫率领的保加利亚政府代表团15日乘飞机到达莫斯科。
    代表团团员有：保加利亚共产党中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫，部长会议第一副主席詹科夫，部长会议第一副主席、保加利亚农民联盟书记特莱科夫，部长会议副主席兼贸易部长达米扬诺夫，部长会议副主席兼教育和文化部长契尔文科夫，保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记斯塔伊科夫和外交部长卢卡诺夫。代表团团员中还有保加利亚驻苏联大使格拉西莫夫。
    到机场欢迎客人的有布尔加宁、米高扬、萨布罗夫、赫鲁晓夫、福尔采娃、苏联部长们和其他政府官员等。
    聚集在机场上的莫斯科劳动人民的代表们热烈欢迎保加利亚的客人们。
    于哥夫在机场上发表了讲话。
    他说，保加利亚人民同苏联人民是以牢不可破的友谊永远联系在一起的。保苏两国人民之间的友谊具有深远的根源。对于保加利亚人来说，同苏联的友谊是宝贵的、是神圣的。这种友谊是保加利亚社会主义发展的强大推动力。如果没有这种友谊，没有以伟大苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营国家的团结，我们就不能想像会有一个自由和独立的社会主义保加利亚。
    于哥夫接着说，社会主义国家的友谊和团结、它们的爱好和平的愿望和苏联政府的和平政策，不用说，是和平和社会主义的敌人所不喜欢的。帝国主义者非常害怕和平和社会主义力量的团结和不断增长。他们拚命想要再使国际局势紧张，如果可能的话，他们还要拆散我们友好和强大的社会主义家庭。但是，社会主义国家的团结，世界上和平力量的团结是巩固的、牢不可破的。我们同伟大的苏联的友谊是巩固的、牢不可破的，因为这个友谊和团结是建筑在马克思列宁主义的平等、互相尊重、互助和兄弟合作的原则基础上的。任何黑暗势力都不能摧毁这种团结、友谊和兄弟的合作。这个友谊和团结是永恒的。
    于哥夫最后说，我们深信，我们的友好访问将是对进一步巩固保苏两国兄弟友谊和扩大两国合作的一个新贡献。
