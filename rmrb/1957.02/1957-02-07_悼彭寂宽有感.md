    Thoughts on Mourning Peng Jikuan	Wang Jin
    We deeply mourn the passing of Peng Jikuan, the mother of Nie Er (People's Daily, January 8th). During her lifetime, she humbly said, "I gave birth to Nie Er, but the Communist Party of China educated him." However, whether in cultivating his interest in music or in instilling the virtues of diligence and integrity, she was Nie Er's first teacher. This naturally brings to mind another great Chinese musician, Xian Xinghai's mother, who also nurtured her child with her own lifetime of labor and a tenacious, hardworking spirit. From the diaries and writings of both Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, we can read how much encouragement and support they received from their mothers on their path to learning music and embracing revolution.
    I do not believe that the growth of a genius is solely determined by whether or not they have a good mother, but it is also hard to imagine a genius being easily born without certain objective conditions (including a certain socio-historical environment and family upbringing). This is especially true for musical geniuses. Musical talent often emerges early, and many musical techniques require long-term training from childhood. Therefore, the environment in childhood often determines the lifelong destiny of a musical genius. It is well known that Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and others all had strict family education in their childhoods.
    Even with objective conditions, not everyone can become a musical genius. There are naturally issues of innate aptitude and subjective effort. But in the past, some people circulated a saying: "We only talk about the richness of our national musical heritage, but China has never produced a Beethoven!" The fact that we haven't produced a Beethoven is true, but if we don't look at it from a historical perspective, it is easy to come to the conclusion that China lacks musical geniuses.
    Is that so?… Let's hold off on arguing about historical issues for now. Even the examples of Fu Cong and Liu Shikun will be put aside for the moment. On the very next day after the news of Peng Jikuan's death was published, we read several exciting pieces of news. We learned about Chen Min, a five-year-old pianist in Guangzhou, who has already played more than two hundred pieces, including children's piano pieces by Beethoven and Tchaikovsky; we met Zhao Chengfu, an eleven-year-old Yao ethnic group suona player, who has mastered considerable playing skills; we even saw a photograph of Zhang Meiling, the four-year-old daughter of farmer Zhang Derong from Ningxian County, Gansu, playing the erhu solo. Compared to the child's childish face, the instrument is disproportionately large… But she can already skillfully play Qinqiang and folk songs in four or five different keys.
    I do not doubt that these children have excellent musical qualities. I look forward to seeing their names again among the winners of domestic and international music competitions in ten or twenty years. But I am even more eager to know what will happen after these children's names and photos are published in the People's Daily, after these children have been subjected to the flashing lights of reporters and the praises of enthusiastic people, and after they return home laden with awards and certificates. Will these tender seedlings of musical genius be able to grow smoothly?
    My concern is not without basis. Just a few days before this, we read in the newspaper about the unfortunate experience of Sun Yuxi, a six-year-old erhu player who became famous at a mass amateur music and dance performance. Two years ago, his photo was also printed in the People's Daily like Zhang Meiling's today (the photographer didn't even change the angle of the lens). But according to the reporter's report, after the performance, he became a local "celebrity," going everywhere with the Jilin Railway delegation to perform. The leaders, thinking he was a rare commodity in order to win awards, forced him to take on tasks that he could not handle physically or technically, to the point where the child cried and begged; they even made him accompany dances late at night, to the point where he fell off his chair from exhaustion… Having suffered these abuses, the child fell ill at home, selling his instruments and awards to maintain his life, and even now the problem of schooling has not been resolved…
    This infuriating example may be an isolated case, but it is a wake-up call for us. Chinese Beethovens will surely emerge from our descendants. Basic guarantees for this exist in terms of socio-historical conditions. But we must overcome the negative effects of those mediocre people who only offer blind praise and exploitation, without genuine care and cultivation. Good varieties need suitable gardens, and even more, they need suitable gardeners.
    We need more Nie Ers, but first and foremost, we need more Peng Jikuans.

### 悼彭寂宽有感

    悼彭寂宽有感	王晋
    聂耳的母亲彭寂宽逝世了（1月8日人民日报），我们深深地悼念她。她在生前曾谦虚地说过：“生聂耳的是我，教育聂耳的是中国共产党。”但不论在对音乐兴趣的培养上，或是在勤劳、正直的品德教育上，她都是聂耳的第一个教师。这很自然地令人联想到另一个伟大的中国音乐家冼星海的母亲，她也是以自己大半生的劳动，以顽强、刻苦的生活精神教养了自己的孩子的。我们从聂耳和冼星海的日记和一些论述中，都可以读到他们在学习音乐和走向革命的道路上得到了他们的母亲多大的鼓舞和支持。
    我并不认为一个天才的成长只是决定于他有没有一个好母亲，但离开一定的客观条件（包括一定的社会历史环境和家庭教养）期望天才轻易地诞生也是难以想像的事。特别是音乐天才更是这样。音乐天才往往是早慧的，音乐上的许多技术也需要从儿童时代就开始长期锻炼，因此小时的环境常常决定了一个音乐天才的终身命运。像巴哈、莫扎特、贝多芬等小时都有过严格的家庭教养，这是大家所熟知的。
    有了客观条件，并不是人人都能成为音乐天才，这里自然还有天赋素质和主观努力的问题。但过去在有些人中流行着一种这样的论调：“光说民族音乐遗产丰富，但中国没有产生过贝多芬！”——没有产生过贝多芬，这倒也是事实，但如果不以历史的眼光来看，很容易得出这样的结论：中国缺少音乐天才。
    是这样的吗？……历史上的问题且慢些论证，甚至傅聪、刘诗昆的例子也暂且不去引用，就在登载着彭寂宽逝世的消息的隔一天的报纸上，我们就读到好几条令人兴奋的消息。我们知道了广州的五岁小钢琴手陈敏，她已经弹会了包括贝多芬和柴可夫斯基的一些儿童钢琴曲在内的二百多首曲子；我们认识了十一岁的瑶族唢呐手赵成福，他已经掌握了相当熟练的吹奏技巧；我们甚至看到了甘肃宁县农民张德荣的四岁女儿张美玲二胡独奏的照片，和满脸稚气的孩子比起来，乐器是那样大得不相称……但她已能熟练地拉出四、五种调门的秦腔和民歌。
    我不怀疑这些孩子们有着优异的音乐素质，我期望着十年二十年以后在国内外音乐比赛的优胜者中再看到他们的名字；但是我更急切地愿意知道当这些孩子的姓名和照片在人民日报上公布以后，当这些孩子们经受了记者们的闪光灯和热心人士的颂词赞语并且满载着奖旗和奖状回去以后又怎么样，这些音乐天才的嫩苗能够顺利地茁长起来吗？
    我的这种担心并不是毫无根据的，恰好也是在这几天以前的报纸上我们读到在群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会上出名的六岁小二胡手孙玉玺的不幸遭遇。两年以前他的照片也像现在的张美玲一样印在人民日报上（摄影记者甚至连镜头的角度都没有变），但据记者报道，会演以后，他成了地方上的“红人”，随着吉林铁路代表团到处去演出，领导上为了得奖旗，以为奇货可居，就勉强他担任体力上和技术上都不能胜任的任务，以至孩子哭着哀求；甚至让他深夜伴舞，以至困得从椅子上掉下来……经受了这些摧残，孩子病倒家中，典卖乐器和奖品来维持生活，直到现在就学的问题还没有解决……
    这种令人激愤的例子也许是个别的，但却是对我们的一个当头棒喝。我们的后代中一定会产生出中国式的贝多芬来的，这在社会历史条件方面已经有了基本保证，但却必须克服那种只有盲目颂扬和利用没有真诚关心和培养的庸碌之辈的消极作用。好的品种需要适合的园地，更需要适合的园丁。
    我们需要更多的聂耳，但这首先需要更多的彭寂宽。
