Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Telegram: Two hundred thousand workers in Shaanxi Province received political education around the Spring Festival. This work was organized by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Nearly a hundred reporters, including Fang Zhongru, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, and Shi Yizhi, Deputy Governor, made hundreds of political reports in various factories and construction sites in Shaanxi Province during this period. The workers listened to the reports very enthusiastically, and even 90% of the construction workers scattered at various construction sites listened to the reports.

After listening to the reports, the workers had informal talks or discussions, and actively launched a campaign to increase production and practice thrift. After listening to the reports, the workers of the state-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory discussed again the target of reducing costs in the first quarter, and finally re-proposed to reduce it by more than 27,000 yuan from the originally planned reduction of more than 14,000 yuan. The workers of the joint state-private Xinchang Wood Factory also criticized the idea of "small stall, not much profit" and came up with a method of using lime and carbonic acid instead of Tianfen raw materials, saving more than 10,000 yuan. Even the workers of a "Wenqing Canopy and Color Shop" saved more than 1,600 yuan by using discarded straw mats when building sheds for the slaughterhouse. The formation of this atmosphere of increasing production and practicing thrift is a direct result of the political education received by the workers.

Many workers, after receiving education on strengthening organizational discipline and communist morality, launched self-criticism. A group of workers transferred from other places to an enterprise automatically reviewed their past thoughts that they disliked the hard life in Xi'an and were not at ease in their work. Some workers in a factory who had originally collectively demanded wage treatment consciously reviewed that this behavior was wrong.

More than 36,000 workers of the newly established joint state-private enterprises and members of cooperatives who listened to the political reports now also recognize the state's policy of redemption for capitalists, and understand that doing a good job in state-private relations is beneficial to the country and the working class.

    陕西省二十万职工受到政治教育
    据新华社西安电　陕西省有二十万职工在春节前后受到一次政治教育。这项工作是中共陕西省委组织的，省委书记方仲如、副省长时逸之等近百名报告员，在这期间曾深入陕西省各工厂工地做了上百次的政治报告。听报告的职工非常踊跃，连分散在各工地的建筑工人，也有90％听了报告。
    职工们听报告后都进行漫谈或讨论，并且积极展开了增产节约运动。国营西北第二棉纺织厂职工听了报告后，再次讨论第一季度降低成本的指标，最后从原拟定的降低一万四千多元，重新提出要降低二万七千多元。公私合营新昌木器厂的职工，也批判了“摊子小、油水不大”的思想，想出用石灰和炭酸代替天粉原料的办法，节约一万多元。连一家叫“文庆棚彩店”的职工，给屠宰场搭棚子时，也利用原想报废的席片，省了一千六百多元。这种增产节约风气的形成是职工受到政治教育后的直接结果。
    许多职工受了关于加强组织纪律和共产主义道德问题的教育后，都展开自我批评。有一个企业里从外地调来的一批职工，就自动检讨他们过去嫌西安生活苦，不安心工作的思想。还有一个工厂里原来集体闹工资待遇的一些工人，都自觉检讨这种行为是不对的。
    听了政治报告的三万六千多名新公私合营企业职工和合作社的社员，现在也认清了国家对资本家实行赎买政策，并且懂得了搞好公私关系对国家和工人阶级是有利的。
