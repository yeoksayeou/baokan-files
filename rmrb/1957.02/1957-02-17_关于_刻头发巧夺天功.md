Concerning "Hair Carving, Divine Skill"
		Huí Chūn

	On February 9th, many newspapers in Beijing published news about the Soviet Armenian sculptor Kasaryan's "unique" and "hair carving with divine skill" ("Beijing Daily" headline), which resolved a question that had accumulated in my mind for many years.
	In 1952, when I went to Guangzhou, I heard a friend mention that there was a folk carving artist in Changdi (sp?) of Guangzhou who had carved the five characters "Serve the People" on a single strand of hair. Some other friends absolutely did not believe this, but the person who told the story insisted that it was true.
	At that time, I thought: if this is the case, it is naturally very surprising, but even more worthy of study. Humanity is truly a strange thing. Its understanding must reveal the secrets of the infinitely vast macroscopic world and also exhaust the mysteries of the infinitely subtle microscopic world. And its creation is constantly striving towards both the macroscopic and microscopic directions. We usually no longer doubt the possibility of understanding the macroscopic and microscopic worlds; we also no longer doubt the possibility of the appearance of enormous creations, but we still find the fine labor of carving words on a single strand of hair to be incredible. It is already difficult to see the tip of an autumn hair clearly, and carving it is truly a miracle. One is the tool problem, which is easy to understand now; but hundreds of years ago in our country, someone had already created the story of "A Trip to the Red Cliff" on a peach (sp?) pit. Did they already have magnifying glasses or similar things at that time? I do not know. But the more difficult problem to solve is, given extremely sophisticated tools, how do people use them? At that time, I was interested in Pavlov's advanced nerve activity theory; therefore, I thought, if there is such a thing, then conducting a study on the formation process of such skills in terms of conditioned reflexes might also be "unique" and not without significance?
	At that time, only such an idea arose, and naturally no research was conducted; moreover, regarding the matter of carving words on a strand of hair itself, I only adopted a skeptical attitude and did not think of investigating it.
	The publication of the news about Kasaryan proves, at least, that carving words on a strand of hair is indeed possible; although whether the Guangzhou incident is real is still a question. I think that those who are interested in Guangzhou can investigate it; if this is indeed the case, then that folk carving artist is also worthy of attention.
	What I mean by attention is not to advocate or promote this kind of skill. The main creative power of the people should now – and in fact is – concentrated on solving the urgent needs of the people's livelihood in the production of living materials. The magnitude and fineness of creations generally develop according to the needs and possibilities of real life. Things that seem too huge now only have a small part of the collective force going to plan, design, and manufacture them; things that seem too subtle now also only have a very small number of people studying them; this is in accordance with the law. But since someone has actually created something very subtle, we don't have to oppose it, simply saying it is "indulging in trivialities and neglecting great matters"; and we should also affirm this fact and think about the significance of this fact. I think that this fact has at least the following meanings: first, it makes us understand that life is rich and complex, and not everything can be summarized by a few basic situations; second, it makes us understand that human interests and abilities also have such a possibility of development; third, it raises some new questions for scientific research. Thinking about these things will enlighten our minds and prevent our thoughts from becoming simplistic and solidified.
	We have begun to pay attention to the various "unique" creations of the people in art and technology, and many have already been discovered. Among these, some are of universal significance. Others are just some accidental, individual, or so-called "variant" flowers. But in the latter part, perhaps we can still divide them into two categories: one is something with development prospects, or at least something that can be grafted onto other normally developing things; the other is something that has no development prospects at all. But even the latter category is not without significance for scientific research, is it?
	However, when we appreciate and study very sophisticated things, we must indeed prevent the tendency of "indulging in trivialities and neglecting great matters." I don't know about Kasaryan's life and work, but I guess that since he is a sculptor, he must have large-scale works and not just be carving hair strands, right?

    关于“刻头发巧夺天功”
    回春
    2月9日的北京的许多报纸上，登载了苏联亚美尼亚一位雕刻家卡萨尔扬“别开生面”、“刻头发巧夺天工”（“北京日报”的标题）的消息，这解决了我蓄积多年的一个疑问。
    1952年，我到广州去，曾听一个朋友谈起，广州的长堤（？）有一位民间雕刻艺人，曾在一根头发上刻成“为人民服务”五个字。别的一些朋友绝对不信此事，讲的人却力说确有其事。
    我那时想了一下：倘有此事，自然很值得惊奇，但更值得研究。人类真是一种怪物，它的认识，既要显露无限巨大的宏观世界的秘密，又要穷究无限精细的微观世界的奥妙；而它的创造，也是不断向着宏大和精微这两个方向努力。我们通常对于认识宏观世界和微观世界的可能性，已经没有怀疑了；对于出现巨大的创造物的可能性，也已经没有什么怀疑，而对于在一根头发上刻字的精细劳动，却还觉得不可思议。明察秋毫，已是难事，刻划秋毫，确系奇迹。一是工具问题，这在现在是容易理解的了；但我国几百年前就已有人在一个桃（？）核上刻“赤壁之游”的故事的创作，那时是不是已经有放大镜之类的东西呢？我不知道。但更难解的问题，是有了极精巧的工具，人又是怎样运用它们的？我那时正对巴甫洛夫的高级神经活动学说有兴趣；因此想，如果有这样的事，那么，对这类技巧的形成过程作一番条件反射方面的研究，也许也是“别开生面”，不无意义的罢？
    当时只起了这样一种想法，自然并没有进行研究；而且对于在头发丝上刻字这事本身，我只是采取了将信将疑的态度，也没有想到该去调查一下。
    关于卡萨尔扬的消息一发表，至少证明在头发丝上刻字这事是确实可能的了；虽然广州的那件事是否实有还是问题。我以为，在广州的有心人，很可以调查一下；若果有此事，那么，那位民间雕刻艺人，也是值得重视的。
    我所谓重视，并不是去提倡、推广这类技艺的意思。人民的主要创造力量，现在还应当——而且实际上也正是集中在解决当前人民生活所迫切需要的生活资料的生产上。创造物的巨大程度和精细程度，一般是根据现实生活的需要和可能而发展的。现在看来还是太巨大的东西，只分出小部分集体力量去规划、设计和制造；现在看来还是太精微的东西，也只有极少数的人在钻研；这是合乎规律的。但实际上既已有人创作出非常精微的东西来了，我们也不必去反对它，简单地说是“玩物丧志”；而且还应当肯定这事实，并想一想这事实的意义。我以为，这事实至少有这样几点意义：第一，它使我们了解生活是丰富复杂的，并非几条基本情况所能概括一切；第二，它使我们了解人类的兴趣和能力，也有这样一个发展的可能；第三，它对科学研究提出一些新问题。想想这些，就会使我们的头脑得到启发，思想不至于简单化和凝固化。
    我们对于人民群众在文艺上和技术上的种种“别开生面”的创造，是注意起来了，发掘出来的也已不少。这里面，一部分是有普遍意义的。另一部分，则只是一些偶然的、个别的，或者叫做“变种”的花朵。但在后一部分里面，也许还可以分做两类：一类是有发展前途的东西，或者至少可以在别的正常发展的东西上面嫁接的；另一类则是完全没有发展前途的东西。但就是后一类对于科学研究，也不是毫无意义的罢？
    不过，我们在欣赏和研究非常精巧的东西的时候，的确也要防止“玩物丧志”的倾向。卡萨尔扬的生活和工作，我不知道，猜想起来，他既然是个雕刻家，未必没有大件的作品而一味只在刻头发丝罢？
