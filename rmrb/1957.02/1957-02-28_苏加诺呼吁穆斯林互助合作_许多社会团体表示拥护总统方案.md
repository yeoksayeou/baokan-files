Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 27th - President Sukarno, at a celebration of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascension Day on the evening of the 26th, called on the Muslims present to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation.

    He used a story of Muhammad to illustrate this point. The story tells of how, on one occasion, some people belonging to different tribes were competing to move a sacred black stone to build a house and could not agree. Muhammad came and asked everyone to work together to lift the black stone, resolving the dispute.

    Sukarno hoped that the four thousand Muslims attending the celebration would learn from Muhammad's spirit of tolerance and cooperation.

    The celebration, held solemnly at the State Palace in Jakarta, was initiated by the Indonesian Islamic Organizations Liaison Agency. This agency had previously expressed opposition to President Sukarno's plan because the plan advocated the participation of the Indonesian Communist Party in the cabinet.

    Up to now, the Islamic political parties have not formally expressed their opinions on the President's plan. According to newspaper reports, the Islamic Teachers Association will propose amendments to the issue of the Indonesian Communist Party joining the cabinet.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 27th - Students in Jakarta held a meeting on the 26th to express their support for President Sukarno's plan. The resolution of the meeting stated that Sukarno's plan is the "only way to overcome the unstable state of the government and get rid of the current difficult situation." The resolution pointed out that the unstable political situation in the past has prevented the thorough implementation of education plans, which has harmed the interests of students.

    The Council of the Indonesian National Teachers Association issued a statement expressing a "warm welcome" to the President's plan for being able to "realize the cause of domestic peace."

    The Provisional Council of the Indonesian Army Non-Commissioned Officers Association, a nationwide organization with broad influence, also issued a statement supporting the plan of the President and Supreme Commander.

    Trade unions, youth organizations, and other social groups in various places have expressed exceptionally warm concern for President Sukarno's plan. Many groups have held meetings, sent telegrams, issued statements, or sent representatives to meet with the President, expressing their support for the plan.

    Major cities such as Bandung, Palembang, Semarang, Surabaya, and Yogyakarta are preparing to hold mass rallies in the next two days to support the President's plan.

    Some local members of the Masyumi Party also expressed different opinions from some central leaders of the party. Sibran, the leader of the Sukabumi local Masyumi Party organization in West Java, said that he hoped to see further cooperation between all parties and the Indonesian Communist Party to achieve domestic peace.

    苏加诺呼吁穆斯林互助合作
    许多社会团体表示拥护总统方案
    新华社雅加达27日电　苏加诺总统26日晚在伊斯兰教主升天节的纪念会上呼吁到会的穆斯林发扬互助合作精神。
    他以穆罕默德的一个故事来说明这一点。这个故事说，有一回，有些属于不同部落的人们抢着搬一块神圣的黑石去修房子而争持不下，穆罕默德来了，他让大家一齐协力把那块黑石搬上去，解决了纷争。
    苏加诺希望参加纪念会的四千伊斯兰教徒学习穆罕默德的忍让合作精神。
    这个在雅加达国家宫隆重举行的纪念会是由印度尼西亚伊斯兰教团体联络机构发起的。这个机构曾经表示反对苏加诺总统的方案，因为方案主张印度尼西亚共产党参加内阁。
    直到现在为止，各伊斯兰教政党还没正式表示他们对总统方案的意见，据报纸消息，伊斯兰教师联合会将对印度尼西亚共产党入阁问题提出修正意见。
    新华社雅加达27日电　雅加达的学生在26日举行大会表示拥护苏加诺总统的方案。大会的决议说，苏加诺方案是“克服政府的不稳定状态和摆脱目前困难处境的唯一道路”。决议指出，过去不稳定的政局使教育计划不能彻底执行，损害了学生的利益。
    印度尼西亚全国教师协会理事会发表声明，对总统方案能够“实现国内和平事业表示热烈欢迎”。
    有广泛影响的全国性组织印度尼西亚陆军士官协会的临时理事会也发表声明拥护总统兼最高统帅的方案。
    各地工会、青年组织和其他社会团体对苏加诺总统的方案表示了异常热烈的关心。许多团体开大会、打电报、发表声明或者派代表去见总统，表示他们对方案的支持。
    万隆、巨港、三宝垅、泗水和日惹等主要城市都准备在这两天内举行拥护总统方案的群众大会。
    一些地方的马斯友美党的党员也表示同这个党的某些中央领导人不同的意见。西爪哇苏甲武眉地方马斯友美党组织的领袖希布兰说，他希望看到各党派同印度尼西亚共产党进一步合作以实现国内和平。
