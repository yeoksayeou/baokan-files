Xinhua News Agency News: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China recently held a domestic Overseas Chinese affairs work reporting meeting to review the Overseas Chinese affairs work in 1956 and formulate a work plan for 1957.

The meeting was attended by responsible cadres from the Overseas Chinese affairs departments of Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, as well as representatives from relevant central departments.

The meeting believed that the domestic Overseas Chinese affairs work in 1956 had achieved considerable success with the help and cooperation of local Party committees, governments, and relevant departments. However, there are still some problems in the work of various regions that need to be properly resolved.

The representatives believed that regarding the issue of Overseas Chinese dependents participating in agricultural production, in Overseas Chinese areas, economic crops should be developed and diversified operations should be carried out on a certain proportion of land on the basis of gradually increasing the yield per unit area. For Overseas Chinese dependents and returned Overseas Chinese who have handicraft skills, relevant urban and rural departments should, in the future, organize them to participate in handicraft production cooperatives or handicraft production groups within agricultural production cooperatives, under unified leadership and planning, and strengthened management, according to market supply, production, and sales conditions, in order to give full play to their production enthusiasm.

Regarding the issue of guiding Overseas Chinese to invest in the country, the meeting believed that unified leadership must be exercised over Overseas Chinese investment activities, Overseas Chinese investment shares should be incorporated into the national construction plan, and the interests of investors should be effectively protected. Under the principle of unified policy and separate fundraising, funds should be appropriately allocated to meet the construction needs of Overseas Chinese hometowns, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of Overseas Chinese for loving their country and native place. The Overseas Chinese Reclamation Company is currently in preparation, and Overseas Chinese should be actively called upon and organized to invest in reclamation.

The phenomenon of encroachment on Overseas Chinese remittances has decreased, but due to the unreasonable allocation of materials in Overseas Chinese areas, there has been a disconnection between supply and demand. Therefore, the meeting believed that the relevant departments should be advised to incorporate the supply of materials to Overseas Chinese hometowns into the national plan, without affecting national construction and material allocation plans, and on the premise of good Overseas Chinese-peasant relations, to reasonably and gradually meet the needs of Overseas Chinese dependents and returned Overseas Chinese.

Based on the situation and experience of various provinces and cities in resettling returned Overseas Chinese, the meeting believed that the policy of "resettlement according to origin, mainly oriented towards rural areas, and employing those with skills according to their talents" is correct and should be further implemented. Returned Overseas Chinese who have homes to return to should be resettled in agricultural production cooperatives that lack labor; if it is indeed difficult to resettle them in cooperatives, areas with wasteland can be selected within the province, and they can be provided with production funds to set up small farms for resettlement. The meeting also focused on discussing the reception and distribution work for resettling returned Overseas Chinese in employment in 1957, as well as the issue of living subsidies for needy families of returned Overseas Chinese.

The meeting suggested that relevant departments take effective measures to solve the current problem of children of Overseas Chinese dependents not being able to enter middle school, such as expanding existing Overseas Chinese-run middle schools, continuing to support schools that were once taken over by the government but have now been returned to Overseas Chinese for self-management; encouraging Overseas Chinese to invest in middle schools and various remedial Overseas Chinese schools; and implementing a two-part system in ordinary middle schools in Overseas Chinese areas. Regarding the issue of schooling for returned Overseas Chinese students, the meeting believed that the general policy should be "welcoming Overseas Chinese students to return to China for further education," but different measures should be taken according to different situations. Attention should be paid to the education of Overseas Chinese children abroad, and Overseas Chinese compatriots abroad should be actively encouraged to develop primary and secondary education. At the same time, Overseas Chinese students who have graduated from high school are welcome to return to China to apply for universities; for primary and secondary school students who have already returned to China, they should also be properly arranged to enroll in schools.

The meeting also discussed the issue of domestic Overseas Chinese affairs propaganda work. The meeting also requested Overseas Chinese affairs departments in various regions to call on Overseas Chinese dependents and returned Overseas Chinese to be diligent and thrifty. Overseas Chinese dependents and returned Overseas Chinese who are affluent should cherish their own and their relatives' labor income, and Overseas Chinese affairs departments in various regions should encourage them, on a voluntary basis, to use their surplus funds to participate in savings, invest in collective production, or develop household sideline production, in order to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland.

The meeting believed that in 1957, it is also necessary to do a good job in uniting Overseas Chinese abroad and unite all Overseas Chinese compatriots who can be united. Overseas Chinese abroad should respond to Premier Zhou's call, improve relations within the Overseas Chinese community, unite all those who can be united under the banner of patriotism, and strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Overseas Chinese abroad should also abide by the laws of the government of their country of residence, respect the customs and religious beliefs of the people of their country of residence, and humbly and cautiously establish close friendships with them, to make greater contributions to the motherland, to their country of residence, and to world peace.

    充分发挥华侨爱国爱乡的积极性
    侨务工作会议制定1957年工作计划
    新华社讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会最近举行了国内侨务工作汇报会议，检查1956年的侨务工作，并制定1957年的侨务工作计划。
    出席这次会议的有广东、福建、云南、广西、浙江、山东和北京、上海、天津等省、市侨务部门的负责干部以及中央各有关部门的代表。
    会议认为，1956年的国内侨务工作在各地党、政府和有关部门的帮助、配合下，取得了不少成绩。但是各地的工作中也有一些问题需要加以妥善解决。
    代表们认为，对侨眷参加农业生产的问题，在侨区采取在逐步提高单位面积产量的基础上，用一定比例的土地来发展经济作物，开展多种经营。有手工业技能的侨眷、归侨，今后城乡有关部门应该根据市场供、产、销的情况，组织他们参加适合于他们专长和技能的手工业生产合作社或农业生产合作社内的手工业生产小组，统一领导，统一规划，加强管理，以发挥他们的生产积极性。
    关于辅导华侨回国投资问题，会议认为，必须对华侨投资业务进行统一领导，将华侨投资股金纳入国家建设计划，并切实保障投资人的利益。在统一政策、分别劝募的原则下，应该适当地调拨资金，满足侨乡的建设要求，以发挥华侨爱国爱乡的积极性。目前华侨垦殖公司已在着手筹备，应该积极号召和组织华侨投资垦殖事业。
    目前侵犯侨汇的现象已经减少，但是因侨区物资调拨不合理，出现了供求脱节的现象。因此，会议认为应向有关部门建议：对侨乡的物资供应在不影响国家建设和物资调配计划以及侨、农关系的前提下，应纳入国家的计划之中，合理地逐步地满足侨眷、归侨的需要。
    会议根据各省市历来安置归侨的情况和经验，认为“按籍安置，主要面向农村，有技能者量才录用”的方针是正确的，应该进一步深入贯彻执行。归侨有家可归的，应该把他们安置在缺乏劳动力的农业生产合作社；如果将他们安置在合作社确实有困难，可以在省的范围内选择有荒地的地区，资助他们生产资金，举办小型农场进行安置。会议并着重对1957年安置归侨就业的接待、分配工作，以及对有困难的归侨家属的生活补助问题进行了讨论。
    会议建议有关部门采取有效措施来解决目前侨眷子女考不上中学的问题。如扩充现有侨办中学，对一度由政府接办现又归还华侨自办的学校继续给予支持；鼓励华侨出资举办中学及各种补习性质的侨校；在侨区普通中学实行二部制等。关于归国华侨学生就学问题，会议认为总的方针应该是“欢迎华侨学生回国升学”，但是应该根据不同情况采取不同的措施。应该充分重视国外华侨子弟的教育问题，积极鼓励国外侨胞发展中、小学教育，同时欢迎高中毕业的华侨学生回国投考大学；对于已回国的中小学学生，亦应妥善地安置他们入学。
    会议还讨论了国内侨务宣传工作问题。会议还要求各地侨务部门号召侨眷、归侨要勤俭节约。生活富裕的侨眷、归侨要珍惜自己和国外亲人的劳动所得，各地侨务部门要鼓励他们在自愿的原则下把余款参加储蓄、投资集体生产或用来发展家庭副业生产，以加速祖国的社会主义建设。
    会议认为，在1957年还要做好国外华侨的团结工作，团结一切可以团结的侨胞。国外华侨应该响应周总理的号召，搞好侨民内部的关系，把一切可能团结的人都团结在爱国主义的旗帜下，争取和平解放台湾。国外华侨还应该遵守侨居国政府的法律，尊重侨居国人民的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，谦虚、谨慎地与他们建立亲密的友谊，为祖国、为侨居国、为世界和平做出更大贡献。
