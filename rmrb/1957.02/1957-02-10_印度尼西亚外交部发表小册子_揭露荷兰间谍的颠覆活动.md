Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 9th: The Indonesian Foreign Ministry held a press conference this morning to release a booklet on subversive activities within Indonesia and the cases of Dutch subversive elements Rongschlager and Schmidt.

This ninety-five-page booklet contains undeniable evidence proving that Dutch colonialists are the masterminds behind subversive activities within this young republic.

The booklet points out: Colonial countries are unwilling to see their colonies gain autonomy, which is why subversive activities aimed at undermining and overthrowing the Republic of Indonesia exist.

It continues: The subversive activities supported by the Dutch are linked to the illegal armed bandits who have been disrupting security throughout Indonesia for the past seven years. It states: "These bandits could not continue to exist without foreign weapons, ammunition, and medicines being airdropped."

The booklet details how the Dutch aided illegal organizations in the country, including the "Republic of South Moluccas," the "Islamic State Movement," the "Netherlands East Indies Guerrilla Forces," "White Eagle," and the "Armed Forces of the Kingdom of the Bright Truth," among others.

The booklet lists the testimonies of some important witnesses during the Rongschlager case trial, which had not been published before. These testimonies show that since 1950, the Dutch military delegation in Jakarta has been a center for subversive activities. A man named Amirudin, who worked for Dutch military intelligence in Sumatra in 1949, infiltrated the Indonesian Ministry of Defense with the assistance of the Dutch military delegation and obtained a responsible position, thereby stealing "internal intelligence" for the officers of the Dutch military delegation. Furthermore, special agents were dispatched to infiltrate other departments.

The weapons used by the "Armed Forces of the Kingdom of the Bright Truth" led by Westerling in the 1950 attack on Bandung were taken from the warehouse of the Dutch military delegation, and the munitions were shipped from Singapore to Indonesia by ships belonging to the American General Motors Corporation.

In response to questions at the press conference, Dr. Subandrio, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, said: "We cannot avoid the impression that certain foreign elements want to influence Indonesia's democratic system. They openly express their desire for certain people to participate in the government. They probably do this while adhering to the tradition that they consider it their responsibility to provide such 'cooperation.'"

    印度尼西亚外交部发表小册子
    揭露荷兰间谍的颠覆活动
    新华社雅加达9日电　印度尼西亚外交部今天上午在记者招待会上发表了关于在印度尼西亚境内的颠覆活动以及荷兰籍颠覆分子荣斯拉格和施密特案件的小册子。
    这本九十五页的小册子中记载了许多无可否认的证据，证明荷兰殖民主义者是在这个年青的共和国境内进行颠覆活动的幕后指使者。
    小册子指出：殖民国家不愿意看到他们的殖民地获得自治，这就是目的在于破坏并且推翻印度尼西亚共和国的颠覆活动所以存在的原因。
    它继续说：荷兰人所支持的颠覆活动是同过去七年中不时扰乱印度尼西亚各地安全的非法武装匪徒有联系的。它说：“如果没有飞机空投外来的武器、弹药和药品等，这些匪帮就不可能继续存在下去。”
    小册子详细地揭发了荷兰人如何援助这个国家的非法组织，其中包括“南摩鹿加共和国”、“伊斯兰教国运动”、“荷兰东印度游击部队”、“白鹰”、“光明的真理王国武装部队”等等。
    这本小册子列举了在审理荣斯拉格案件的时候一些重要证人的证词，这些证词以前一直没有公布过。这些证词表明，自从1950年以来，荷兰驻雅加达的军事代表团一直是颠覆活动的中心。有一个名叫阿米鲁丁的人，1949年曾在苏门答腊的荷兰军事情报机关工作过。他在荷兰军事代表团的协助之下打入印度尼西亚国防部，并且取得了负责职位，这样来为荷兰军事代表团的军官们窃取“内部情报”。而且还派遣了一些特务分子打入其他部门。
    以韦斯特灵为首的“光明的真理王国武装部队”1950年进攻万隆时使用的武器是从荷兰军事代表团的仓库里取出来的，而且由属于美国通用汽车公司的船只从新加坡把军火运到印度尼西亚。
    印度尼西亚外交部秘书长苏班德里约博士在记者招待会上答复问题时说：“我们不免有这样的印象：某些外国分子要影响印度尼西亚的民主制度。他们公开表示他们希望某些人参加政府。他们这样做大概是坚持这样的传统：他们认为提供这样的‘合作’是他们的责任。”
