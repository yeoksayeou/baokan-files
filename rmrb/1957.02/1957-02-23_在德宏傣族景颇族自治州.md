In the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture
By our reporters Qin Junguang and Zhang Jiechun

In the southwest border of our motherland, in the southern part of the Hengduan Mountains, lies a fertile land of nearly 40,000 square kilometers—the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture. The autonomous prefecture includes the ten counties of Luxi, Ruili, Longchuan, Yingjiang, Lianshan, Lianghe, Baoshan, Tengchong, Changning, and Longling, and the town of Wan町. The first six counties are traditionally known as the border six counties, bordering Myanmar, with a border line of about 400 kilometers. The prefecture is inhabited by Han, Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Benglong and other ethnic groups, totaling more than 1.5 million people.

When the north is already covered with heavy snow, here it is a scene of spring and autumn. Swallows fly in the sky, wildflowers bloom by the roadside, and villages are hidden in the green barriers formed by banyan trees and bamboo groves. Getting up in the morning, there is a cool breeze, with a bit of autumn; looking up, the green mountains are covered with a faint veil, and the rosy glow moves between the peaks, which is full of the scenery of spring. In the afternoon, the blue sky is dotted with white clouds, resembling late autumn, but the weather is as hot as early summer.

This is a fertile land. In many areas, with rough cultivation and sparse planting, without weeding or fertilization, each mu can yield four to five hundred catties of grain. Last year, the Benglong ethnic agricultural cooperative in Santaishan, Luxi, improved its cultivation techniques and implemented reasonable close planting. Without fertilization, it yielded more than 1,000 catties per mu. Last year, the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Baochang Township, Baoshan, intercropped yams along the ditches of the tobacco fields, and the largest one was 1.35 feet long and weighed eight catties. The sugarcane at Nujiang Farm yields 20,000 catties per mu. Last year, the Baoshan Daojieba Cotton Production Cooperative had 36 mu of cotton, yielding 97 catties of ginned cotton per mu. In Longling, a second crop of regenerated cotton can be harvested after the cotton is picked. Elsewhere, a yield of one catty per plant per year during the peak production period is considered good for coffee; here, with good cultivation, the average yield can reach five catties. Wild agave is everywhere, and each labor day can produce five or six catties of rot-resistant hemp for fishing. Fruits are available all year round, including Manshanpo, Niuduguo, pineapples, mangoes, bananas, oranges, etc., which can be seen almost everywhere. Kapok, rubber, and jute also grow very well. There are good conditions for developing animal husbandry here, and there are wild grasses and vegetables for feeding pigs everywhere. There are currently 440,000 pigs in the prefecture, double the number in 1952, with an average of 1.5 pigs per household. Cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, sheep, etc. have also increased by more than half since 1952.

However, in the past, this rich land did not bring happiness to the people. Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty "opened up the southwest barbarians" and established counties in 130 BC, the people here have been under the heavy pressure of the rulers, and most of them lived a life of scarcity. Production technology was backward, paddy fields were cultivated extensively and yielded little, and many dry lands were "slash-and-burn." There was even less talk of medical care and hygiene, and many places became "malarial lands." When diseases came, entire villages died, leaving few households, resulting in terrible sayings such as "malarial areas," "malaria areas," "If you want to go down to the Nujiang Dam, marry your wife first," and the like.

Only after liberation did this place embark on the path it should take. People of all ethnic groups are moving towards a better future in the way they need; some areas carried out land reform through peaceful consultation, while others adopted direct transition methods. The vast number of farmers have their own land, and the upper-class people of all ethnic groups have also been properly settled. At present, the number of farmers who have joined cooperatives accounts for 66.7% of the total number of farmers in the prefecture, and more than 90% of the cooperatives increased their income last year. Handicrafts have basically been collectivized, and there are already 40 local state-owned factories and mines. Last year, the total output value of local industries in the prefecture increased more than six times compared with 1953. The plows and threshers produced in Baoshan and Luxi counties, the porcelain produced in Longling, the orange wine and pineapple wine produced in Mangshi, the iron produced in Tengchong, and the various light industrial products produced by the Baoshan Xinhua Factory are increasingly supplying the needs of various places. The Nujiang Sugar Factory, which will soon be put into production, can produce 58,600 catties of white sugar, 14,500 catties of brown sugar, and 2,600 catties of wine sugar every day. All ethnic groups have begun to have their own working class. At present, the total number of ethnic minority workers in the prefecture has increased by 64% compared with 1953. With the improvement of economic life, the spiritual outlook of people of all ethnic groups is also changing day by day. Now people of all ethnic groups have their own intellectuals, not only middle school students, but also college students. At present, there are nine middle schools and 974 elementary schools in the prefecture. Adult men and women also have the opportunity to learn, and 1,415 people's schools have been set up, as well as more than 100 literacy teams. There has been even greater development in medical care and hygiene. At present, there are more than 11,000 health care workers in the prefecture. Mangshi, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, was a well-known epidemic area before liberation, and malignant malaria and plague seriously threatened people's lives. According to a survey in the early days of liberation, 85 out of every 100 people suffered from malaria; now the annual incidence rate has dropped to below 2%. The Nujiang Dam, where miasma was most prevalent, has also built state-owned farms, reclamation farms, and modern sugar factories.

In the Dehong Autonomous Prefecture, people of all ethnic groups are advancing along the path that their own ethnic group should take. The economic outlook here is changing rapidly, and the spiritual outlook of people of all ethnic groups is also changing with each passing day.

    在德宏傣族景颇族自治州
    本报记者　秦军光　章皆淳
    在我们祖国的西南边境，横断山脉的南部，有一块近四万平方公里的沃土——这是德宏傣族景颇族自治州。自治州包括潞西、瑞丽、陇川、盈江、莲山、梁河、保山、腾冲、昌宁、龙陵十县和畹町镇。前六县习惯上称边六县，与缅甸毗连，约有四百公里的国境线。州内居住着汉、傣、景颇及傈僳、崩龙等十数个民族，共一百五十多万人。
    在北方已是大雪纷飞的时候，这里正是一片春秋景象。燕子在天空飞翔，野花在路旁盛开，村寨在大青树和大竹丛构成的绿色屏障中隐现。早上起来，习习凉风，颇有几分秋意；举眼一望，碧色的群山蒙着一层淡淡的轻纱，朝霞在峰峦间移动，又是十足的春天景象。在下午，蓝蓝的天上泛着朵朵白云，煞似深秋，但天气却热得有如初夏。
    这是一块肥美的土地，许多地区，粗耕疏种，不薅草也不施肥，每亩就可收四、五百斤谷子。潞西三台山崩龙族农业社，去年改进了耕作技术，实行了合理密植，没施肥，一亩就收了一千多斤。保山保场乡红旗农业社，去年在烤烟田沟边套种的山药中，最大的一个长达一点三五尺，有八斤重。怒江农场的甘蔗每亩收到两万斤。保山稻街坝棉花生产合作社，去年有三十六亩棉花，每亩收到皮棉九十七斤。在龙陵，棉花采摘后还可再收一季再生棉花。咖啡在别处，旺产期中每株年产一斤都算不错的；在这里，培植得好的，平均产量可达五斤。野生的龙舌兰到处都有，每花一个劳动日，就可以采制得五、六斤耐腐的渔业用麻。水果是四时不断，曼山坡、牛肚果、菠萝、芒果、芭蕉、香橙等等，几乎是到处都可以见到。木棉、橡胶、柴梗等也都生长得很好。这里有着发展牧畜业的良好条件，饲猪的野草野菜，遍地都是。全州现有猪四十四万头，比1952年增加了一倍，平均每户有一点五头。牛、马、骡、驴、羊等也比1952年增加了一半以上。
    但是，在过去，这富饶的土地并没有给人们带来幸福。从公元前一百三十年汉武帝“通西南夷”置郡县以来，这里的人民一直处在统治者的重压下，绝大部分人都是过着少吃无穿的日子。生产技术低下，水田是采取广种薄收的办法，许多旱地则是“刀耕火种”。医药卫生更谈不上，不少地方成为“瘴疠之地”，疾病来了，整个寨子死得不留几户，以致有什么“瘴气区”、“疟疾区”、“要下怒江坝，先把老婆嫁”以及诸如此类可怕的话语。
    只有解放以后，这里才踏上自己应走的道路。各族人民都按自己所需的方式走向美好的未来；有些地区以和平协商的办法进行了土地改革，有些地区则采取了直接过渡的办法。广大的农民有了自己的土地，各民族上层人士也得到了妥善的安置。现在，加入合作社的农户已占全州总农户的66.7％，去年有90％以上的合作社增加了收入。手工业基本上合作化了，地方国营厂矿也已有了四十个，去年全州地方工业总产值要比1953年增长六倍以上。保山、潞西等县生产的步犁、打谷机，龙陵生产的瓷器，芒市的桔子酒、菠萝酒，腾冲的铁和保山新华工厂生产的各种轻工业品等等，日多一日地供应着各地的需要。即将投入生产的怒江糖厂，每天可生产五万八千六百斤白糖、一万四千五百斤红糖和二千六百斤酒糖。各民族已开始有了自己的工人阶级，目前州内民族工人的总人数已比1953年增长了64％。随着经济生活的改善，各族人民的精神面貌也一天天地改变着。现在各族人民已有了自己的知识分子，不但有中学生，也有大学生。现在全州有中学九所、小学九百七十四所。成年男女也有了学习的机会，民校办起了一千四百一十五所，还有扫盲队一百多个。医药卫生方面更有很大的发展，目前全州已有卫生保健人员一万一千多人。自治州首府芒市，解放前是有名的疾病流行地区，恶性疟疾和鼠疫严重地威胁着人们的生命。据解放初期的调查，每一百个人中就有八十五人患疟疾；现在每年发病率已降低到2％以下。瘴气最盛的怒江坝也建起了国营农场、垦荒农庄和现代化的糖厂。
    在德宏自治州里，各族人民正沿着本民族应走的道路前进，这里的经济面貌在迅速地改变着，各族人民的精神面貌也在日新月异地改变着。
