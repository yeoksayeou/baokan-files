Xinhua News Agency report: The Facts of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Concrete Engineering Company Prove That Even Advanced Construction Enterprises Have Potential for Savings

Are there significant savings to be made in advanced construction enterprises? From the perspective of the Concrete Engineering Company at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation (WISCO) construction site, the answer is yes.

In 1956, the WISCO construction site's Concrete Engineering Company reduced costs by 12%, exceeding the state plan by 9%, and completed the state plan one month and four days ahead of schedule. It was one of the companies at the WISCO construction site that completed the plan faster and reduced costs more than other companies last year. However, this year, when the company convened meetings of Communist Party members, cadres, and worker representatives, and mobilized all employees to discuss and launch the campaign to increase production and practice economy, it still discovered many loopholes and wastes.

For example, regarding the saving of building materials, last year the company promoted bottomless formwork and the widespread use of bamboo formwork, bamboo scaffolding, bamboo utility poles, etc., saving a large amount of wood. Some construction sites used bamboo to replace more than 80% of the wood. However, while many employees paid attention to saving wood, there were many wasteful phenomena in the use of bamboo. The consumption rate of construction tools such as concrete pouring chutes, vibrators, iron hammers, shoulder pole hooks, etc., was unreasonably high, and significant savings can be made this year. There was also waste in administrative management expenses and welfare expenses.

The company's employees used accounting methods to find the waste loopholes from last year and tapped the potential for savings in the enterprise, greatly increasing their confidence in saving resources for the construction of WISCO. This year, the company is undertaking twice the workload of last year. According to this year's engineering characteristics and requirements, the employees have already formulated savings plans and measures. At the company's employee representative meeting held in mid-February, the representatives believed that this year's savings have potential and substance, and the view that there is nothing to save is unfounded.

    武钢混凝土工程公司的事实证明
    先进的建筑企业也有节约潜力
    据新华社讯　先进建筑企业里的节约潜力大不大？从武汉钢铁公司工地上的混凝土工程公司看来，回答是肯定的。
    武钢工地混凝土工程公司在1956年降低成本12％，比国家计划多降低了9％，还提前一个月零四天完成了国家计划。它是去年武钢工地各个工程公司中完成计划较快、降低成本较多的一个公司。但是，今年这个公司在召开共产党员、干部大会和职工代表会议、发动全体职工讨论开展增产节约运动的时候，仍然发现了很多浪费漏洞。
    譬如节约建筑材料，去年这个公司曾经推行无底模板，广泛使用竹模板、竹脚手架、竹电杆等，节约了大量木材，有的工地用竹材代替了80％以上的木材。但是很多职工注意了节约木材，使用竹材的时候却有不少浪费现象。施工工具如浇灌混凝土的串筒、震动器、铁锤、扁担钩等等，损耗率高得不合理，今年也可以大大节约。行政管理费用和福利费用的开支也有浪费。
    这个公司的职工用算账的办法找到了去年浪费的漏洞，挖掘了企业节约的潜力，节约建设武钢的信心大大增加。今年这个公司担负的工作量比去年增加了一倍，职工们已经根据今年的工程特点和要求，订出了节约计划和措施。在2月中旬召开的公司职工代表会议上，代表们认为：今年的节约有潜力、有内容，那种没有什么可节约的看法，是没有根据的。
