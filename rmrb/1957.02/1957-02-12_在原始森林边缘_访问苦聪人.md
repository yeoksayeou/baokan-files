Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 11th - The Kucong People's visiting delegation from Jinping County, Yunnan Province (previously reported as the Nationalities Visiting Delegation), is visiting Kucong people who have settled on the edge of the Ailao Mountain primeval forest.

The visiting delegation was divided into three groups, which arrived at the Kucong people's settlements of Laobaizhai, Daqizhai, and Kucong People's Dazhai before the Spring Festival. Huang Zhengzhong, a member of the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region People's Government Committee, led a visiting group to Kucong People's Dazhai, where the village chief and many young men and women went dozens of miles down the mountain to greet them.

During the visits, the visiting groups publicized the policies of national unity and production development to the Kucong people, and distributed many farm tools, cotton blankets, salt and other items to them. At the visiting meeting in Kucong People's Dazhai, Ta Ze, a 96-year-old Kucong man, received the cotton blanket with trembling hands. He kept stroking the fluff on the blanket, tears of gratitude streaming down his face. This old man had wandered in the deep mountains and forests for decades, never wearing cotton clothes or covering himself with a cotton quilt, and slept naked by the fire pit at night. Jia Ze and Mi Si, a young couple who got married on the day of the visiting meeting, also received a cotton blanket. When the wedding ceremony was held, Jia Ze's father, Mo Sha, said: "In the old forest, when I married Jia Ze's mother, I didn't even have clothes to wear, let alone a quilt to cover myself with." He encouraged his daughter-in-law to cultivate the fields and land well, and engage in labor production.

The visiting delegation also visited many Kucong families to understand the changes in their production and life since settling down and the difficulties that still exist. The visiting delegation also invited a centenarian grandmother to tell the history of the Kucong people.

The visiting activities in the settlements are coming to an end, and the visiting delegation is preparing to enter the primeval forest to find those Kucong people who are still in the forest and help them settle down.

    在原始森林边缘
    访问苦聪人
    新华社昆明11日电　云南省金平县苦聪人访问团（前报道为民族访问团），正在哀牢山原始森林的边缘访问定居的苦聪人。
    访问团分为三路，在春节前夕分别到达了苦聪人定居的老白寨、大七寨和苦聪人大寨。红河哈尼族自治区人民政府委员会委员黄正忠带领的访问小组到苦聪人大寨的时候，这个寨子的村长和许多男女青年都到几十里外的山下去迎接。
    访问团各小组在访问过程中，向苦聪人宣传了民族团结、发展生产的政策，并且发给苦聪人许多农具、棉毯、食盐等物品。在苦聪人大寨的访问大会上，一位九十六岁的苦聪老人塔则，用颤抖的双手接过了发给的棉毯。他不住地抚摸棉毯上的绒毛，感激得老泪横流。这个老人曾经在深山密林里飘流了几十年，从来没有穿过棉衣、盖过棉被，晚上就赤身裸体地睡在火塘边。在举行访问大会那天结婚的青年夫妇戛则和密斯，也得到了一床棉毯。举行结婚仪式的时候，戛则的父亲么沙说：在老林里，我娶戛则他妈那时，连衣服都没有穿的，哪里还有被子盖。他勉励儿媳要好好地开田开地，劳动生产。
    访问团还访问了许多苦聪人的家庭，了解他们定居以来生产生活方面的变化和现在仍然存在的困难。访问团还请一位百岁的老婆婆讲述了苦聪人的历史。
    定居地的访问活动即将结束，访问团正准备进入原始森林里去，寻找那些还在森林中的苦聪人，帮助他们定居下来。
