    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, 2nd: During the Spring Festival, the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Frontline conducted extensive propaganda work towards the Chiang troops entrenched on Kinmen Island.
    The long-distance loudspeakers installed in Xiamen and other places broadcast to the Chiang troops day and night, whenever the wind direction was right. Ignoring enemy fire, the broadcasters repeatedly told the Chiang troops about the joy of the people celebrating the Spring Festival and the fact that peaceful liberation of Taiwan has deeply taken root in people's hearts over the past year. At the request of family members who have sons serving in the Chiang army, the broadcast programs also included letters from the Chiang soldiers' families.
    In recent days, artillery units have continuously launched a large number of propaganda shells, delivering a large quantity of propaganda materials to Kinmen Island. Recently, the skies over Kinmen Island have been lit up at night by red fireballs from exploding propaganda shells, and colorful propaganda materials have often fluttered in the daytime. The artillerymen said that these were "New Year greeting cards" sent to the Chiang troops.

    春节期间福建前线部队
    向金门岛蒋军进行宣传
    新华社福建前线2日电　春节福建前线中国人民解放军向盘踞在金门岛上的蒋军进行了广泛的宣传工作。
    厦门等地安装的长距离的大喇叭，不分昼夜，只要风向适时都在向蒋军广播。广播员们冒着敌人的炮火，把祖国人民欢度春节和一年来和平解放台湾深入人心等消息反复地告诉蒋军。根据有子弟在蒋军中的家属的请求，广播的节目里，还增添了蒋军家信。
    各炮兵部队这几天连续发射了大批宣传弹。把大批宣传品送到金门岛上。最近几天金门岛的上空，夜间不时有宣传弹爆炸的红火球，白天常常飘舞着五色缤纷的宣传品。炮手们说，这是送给蒋军的“贺年片”。
