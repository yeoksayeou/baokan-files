Celebrating with Farmers

Xinhua News Agency

On Lunar New Year's Eve, the Tianjin Fourth Cotton Textile Factory invited over fifty farmers from the "Golden Star" and "Worker-Peasant Alliance" agricultural production cooperatives in the city suburbs to the factory as guests.

When the farmers arrived at the factory, the workers waiting at the gate immediately stepped forward to greet them warmly. The factory and these two agricultural production cooperatives had a close relationship for three to five years. As soon as they met, everyone looked for their old acquaintances. Hosts and guests gathered in groups of three or five to chat, and some participated in recreational activities. Shang Dewen, the deputy director of the "Worker-Peasant Alliance" cooperative who had delivered two large carts of watermelon, potatoes, and other non-staple foods to the factory as gifts last year, found the advanced producer from the factory's "Gulia Group," which was selected as an advanced production group last year. They went to the "Welcoming Spring Teahouse" to talk about their families. On behalf of his agricultural cooperative, Shang Dewen thanked the workers of the factory for their many visits and the more than two thousand books and other gifts they had given last year. At the same time, Shang Dewen also reported good news to everyone: the cooperative had accumulated more than 30,000 cartloads of fertilizer last year and reclaimed more than 7,000 mu of wasteland; the average yield of rice fields per mu had reached more than 720 jin, and the average income of farmers had increased by more than 50% compared to last year. Representatives of the "Gulia Group" also introduced the fact that each person had increased from watching six hundred spindles to eight hundred spindles.

The friendly celebration continued until late at night, and the workers promised to visit the agricultural cooperative on the third day of the Lunar New Year and perform entertainment programs for the farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    同农民联欢
    在农历除夕之夜，天津第四棉纺织厂邀请了市郊“金星”、“工农联盟”农业生产合作社的五十多位农民到厂里作客。
    当农民们来到这个工厂的时候，等候在大门口的工人们立刻热情地上前迎接。这个工厂和这两个农业生产合作社已有了三、五年的深交。大家刚一见面就互相寻找自己的老相识。主人和客人有的三五成群地在谈心，有的参加了文娱活动。曾在去年赶着两大车西瓜、土豆等副食品前来工厂送礼的“工农联盟”社副主任商德文找到了这个工厂在去年被评选为先进生产小组——“古丽亚小组”的先进生产者。他们来到“迎春茶社”谈起了家常。商德文代表他的农业合作社感谢这个工厂的工人们在去年的多次访问和赠送的二千多册图书等礼物。同时商德文也向大家报告了喜事：社里在去年积了三万多车肥料，开垦了七千多亩荒地；每亩稻田的平均产量已达七百二十多斤，农民的收入平均都比去年增加了50％以上。“古丽亚小组”的代表也介绍了每个人由看六百个纱锭增加到八百个纱锭等事迹。
    友好的联欢一直进行到深夜，工人们答应将在旧历初三到农业合作社里去做客，并且为农民演出文娱节目。　（新华社）
