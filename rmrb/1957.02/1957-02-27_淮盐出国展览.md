    Huai Salt to be Exhibited Abroad
    (Our report) The state-owned Huaibei Saltworks has shipped 750 jin of Huai salt, ready for exhibition at the Chinese Exhibition to be held in Japan in March.
    This is the first time Huai salt has been exhibited abroad. As early as mid-January, the Huaibei Salt Bureau selected first-class salt with white color and large grains for careful chemical analysis, and then transported it by train to Xingang in Tianjin, and then shipped it to Japan for exhibition abroad. Seven types of salt produced by saltworks in Liaoning, Shandong, Hainan Island and other places will also be exhibited abroad together with Huai salt.
