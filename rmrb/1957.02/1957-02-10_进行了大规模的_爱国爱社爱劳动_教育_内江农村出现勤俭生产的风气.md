    Large-scale "Love the Country, Love the Society, Love Labor" Education Conducted
    A Frugal Production Ethos Emerges in Rural Neijiang
    (Our Dispatch) Last year, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives in the Neijiang Special District of Sichuan Province increased their income, and the members became more determined to take the path of cooperation. However, some farmers developed the phenomenon of not caring about production within the cooperative and comparing each other's food and clothing. Starting in November of last year, the CCP Neijiang area's Party committees at all levels organized a propaganda army of 400,000 people to launch a large-scale propaganda campaign. Starting from summarizing and promoting the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, they conducted an in-depth education on patriotism, love for the society, and love for labor among the members, and focused on resolving the relationship between carrying out production and improving living standards, opposing excessive eating and drinking, opposing extravagance and waste, and promoting increased production and thrift in running the cooperatives. Various agricultural cooperatives also commended a large number of advanced producers and thrifty members. In addition, the practical actions of cadres going to the countryside, living a hard and simple life, and sharing weal and woe with the peasants, changed the atmosphere of the entire countryside. Last year, Xinyuan Cooperative in Quan'an Township, Neijiang County, increased production greatly. For a period of time, the members paid excessive attention to food and clothing, relaxed production, and fell behind in the township. Subsequently, the members realized that this was not right, so they quickly caught up. The men no longer idly went to market, and the women also pushed the preparations for the Spring Festival to the evening, working more during the day. Even students returning home for vacation all went to work in production. In this way, they finally caught up to the front of the township.
    This new ethos is also evident in the local primary markets. Although it was near the end of the old lunar year, the trading of cattle, pigs, farm tools, and fertilizers was actually more active than before, and the phenomenon of excessive eating and drinking decreased. At the same time, more than 4,000 agricultural cooperatives in the region announced that they would not borrow money from the state, and they relied on members' investment to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds for expanding production this year. Within a month, cooperative members throughout the region voluntarily reported investments of more than 6.9 million yuan to the cooperatives, and more than 3 million yuan in cash had already been paid. Farmers in Neijiang, Renshou and other counties broke through the original plan several times with their self-reported investments, and the investment coverage reached about 60%.

    进行了大规模的“爱国爱社爱劳动”教育
    内江农村出现勤俭生产的风气
    本报讯　四川内江专区去年绝大多数农业社都增加了收入，社员走合作化的道路更加坚定。但部分农民产生了不关心社内生产，相互比较吃穿的现象。去年11月份起中共内江地区各级党委先后组织了四十万人的宣传大军，展开一个声势浩大的宣传活动，从总结和宣传农业社的优越性入手，对社员进行了一次深入的爱国爱社爱劳动的教育，并着重解决了开展生产和改善生活的关系，反对大吃大喝，反对铺张浪费，提倡增产节约，勤俭办社。各个农业社也表扬了大批的先进生产者和勤俭持家的社员，再加下乡干部艰苦朴素与农民同甘共苦的实际行动，整个农村风气为之一变。内江县全安乡新元社去年增产很多，社员有段时间过分讲究吃穿，放松了生产，掉到全乡的后面。随后社员们认识到这样做不对，便急起直追，男的不再无事赶场，女的也把筹办春节的事务推到晚上做，白天多出工，连放假回家的学生也全部出工生产。这样他们终于赶到了全乡的前面。
    这种新风尚，在各地的初级市场上也显露出来，虽然在旧历年关，市场上耕牛、生猪、农具、肥料的交易反而较前活跃，大吃大喝的现象减少了。同时全区有四千多个农业社，宣布不向国家贷款，他们依靠社员投资解决今年扩大生产时资金不足的困难。全区在一个月内，社员向社自报投资六百九十多万元，已缴纳的现金有三百多万元。内江、仁寿等县农民自报的投资几次都突破原订计划，投资面达到60％左右。
