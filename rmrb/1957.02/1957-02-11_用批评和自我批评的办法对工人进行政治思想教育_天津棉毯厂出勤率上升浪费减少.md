Using Criticism and Self-Criticism to Conduct Political and Ideological Education for Workers
Tianjin Cotton Blanket Factory Achieves Increased Attendance Rate and Reduced Waste

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Tianjin Cotton Blanket Factory used criticism and self-criticism to critique the lax labor discipline tendencies that emerged among its workers, achieving good results.

This factory was established at the beginning of last year. The equipment in the factory is relatively simple. Many workers transferred from other factories believed they could not learn any skills and had no future, and were therefore not committed to their work. A group of newly recruited workers from handicraft industries, students, street women, and merchants were also undisciplined and had lax labor discipline. Due to the workers' lack of technical proficiency and lax labor discipline, the quality of the cotton blankets produced by the factory declined month by month. By the fourth quarter of last year, the rate of qualified products was only 47.6%.

The factory's Communist Party branch, trade union organization, and administrative leadership focused their efforts in early December of last year to investigate and study this situation. First, they examined shortcomings in the leadership's work, such as neglecting the political and ideological education of employees. Then, they conducted education on collectivism and compliance with organizational discipline among department cadres, all Party members, and members of the Communist Youth League. At the same time, the trade union organization and the Communist Youth League branch, through wall newspapers and big-character posters, focused on pointing out the losses caused by violations of labor discipline in production, commended outstanding employees who consistently observed discipline, and guided employees to consciously carry out criticism and self-criticism. The factory also established and improved attendance, reward, and other systems from the bottom up, gradually correcting the undesirable tendencies among employees.

Now, the factory workers' habit of observing labor discipline and practicing diligence and thrift has begun to take root. Worker absenteeism has decreased, and the attendance rate has risen from 92% to about 97%. Waste has also been reduced. In the past, the roving section produced an average of seven kilograms of waste yarn per shift, but now it has been reduced to about one kilogram. Wu Shouli, a worker in the weaving section's first shift, used to stop working and turn off his machine when there were too many cotton yarn breakages. Now, his daily output has increased by more than 30% compared to the past. Mu Ruiying, a new worker from a student background, was assigned to the cotton blanket factory last year and felt she had no future and was unenthusiastic about her work, often sleeping during night shifts. Now, she completes her production plan every day. In January, the factory's total output increased by about 20%, and the qualified product rate also rose to 74.5%.

### 用批评和自我批评的办法对工人进行政治思想教育  天津棉毯厂出勤率上升浪费减少

    用批评和自我批评的办法对工人进行政治思想教育
    天津棉毯厂出勤率上升浪费减少
    据新华社讯　天津市棉毯厂用批评和自我批评的办法，批判职工中出现的劳动纪律松弛的不良倾向，收到了良好的效果。
    这个厂是去年年初成立的。厂内的设备比较简单。许多从别厂调来的工人认为学不到技术，没有前途，不安心工作。新招收的一批手工业者、学生、街道妇女、商贩出身的新工人也有一些人自由散漫，劳动纪律松弛。由于工人的技术不熟练和劳动纪律松弛，这个厂生产的棉毯质量逐月下降，到去年第四季度正品率只有47.6％。
    这个工厂的中共支部，工会组织和行政领导方面在去年12月初集中力量对这种情况进行了调查和研究，首先检查了领导工作中忽视职工政治思想教育等缺点，然后，在科室干部、全体党员和青年团员中，进行了集体主义和遵守组织纪律的教育。同时，工会组织、青年团支部在墙报和大字报上，着重指出违犯劳动纪律在生产上造成的损失，表扬一贯遵守纪律的优秀职工，引导职工们自觉地开展批评和自我批评。工厂也自下而上的建立和健全了考勤、奖励等制度。逐步纠正了职工中的不良倾向。
    现在，这个工厂职工遵守劳动纪律、勤俭节约的风气已经开始树立起来。工人旷工的现象减少了，出勤率由过去的92％上升到97％左右，浪费现象也减少了。过去粗纱工段每班平均出废纱七公斤，现在减少到一公斤左右。织布工段甲班工人吴守礼，过去当棉纱断头多的时候就关了车不干活，现在每天的产量已比过去提高30％以上。学生出身的新工人穆瑞英去年被分配到棉毯厂以后，认为没前途，工作不起劲，上夜班时常睡觉。现在，她每天都能完成产量计划。1月份全厂产量约提高20％，产品正品率也上升到74.5％。
