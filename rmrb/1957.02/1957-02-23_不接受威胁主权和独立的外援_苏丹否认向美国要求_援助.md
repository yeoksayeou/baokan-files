Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 22nd -- The Sudanese government issued a statement on the 20th, denying a Reuters report stating that Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil had said his government had decided to seek economic and military assistance from the United States.

The Middle East News Agency quoted the Sudanese official statement as saying that the Sudanese government would not accept assistance from any country that would subject Sudan's sovereignty and independence to any foreign influence or threat.

The statement pointed out when discussing the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that any decision on this issue would first depend on whether it conforms to the interests and tasks of Sudan.

According to the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Gomhuria," Sudanese Foreign Minister Muhammad Ahmad Mahjoub told the newspaper's reporter in New York that Sudan does not accept any foreign aid with political conditions.
