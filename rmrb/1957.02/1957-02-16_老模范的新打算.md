The nationally renowned agricultural labor models Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli, Guo Yu'en, Shen Jilan, and Wu Houli recently met again at the first Shanxi Province Agricultural Production Cooperative Representatives Conference held in Taiyuan City. At this gathering, they spoke freely about their new plans to strive for a bumper harvest in the agricultural production cooperatives they lead this year.

Li Shunda wants "broken-down" land to continue to increase production.

When the reporter visited Li Shunda, he was giving a report at the meeting. His Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, which he leads, suffered three disasters and three rescues last year, achieving a yield of 400 jin of grain per mu on thin, rocky mountain land, and 93% of the cooperative members increased their income. When he reported these achievements, warm applause frequently erupted in the venue.

When he stepped down from the podium and talked to the reporter about his plans for this year, he was silent for a moment and then said: Last year's disasters were too severe, and there are many difficulties in increasing production this year: the land was washed away by heavy rain, houses and livestock pens collapsed, there is a lack of fuel..., but we have learned a lot of experience from fighting the disasters, and all the members of the cooperative are in high spirits and full of confidence. We will repair all the destroyed land, process and increase fertilizer, and build valley embankments. We must harvest 450 jin of grain per mu from these broken-down lands and complete the competition plan that was not achieved last year.

Li Shunda said: In order to complete this plan, our cooperative is currently improving organizational leadership based on the suggestions of the members. We are implementing a two-level leadership system, thoroughly improving financial work, relying mainly on the strength of the cooperative for production investment, and minimizing loans and external debts. The main cadres of the cooperative are responsible for leading production teams, using production to guide production. I personally plan to go deep into a production team for a long time, shorten the time spent in the office, and increase the time working with the members. And deeply guide and improve financial management.

Qu Yaoli wants to experiment with controlling cotton boll shedding.

The rampant growth phenomenon, which is the biggest obstacle to increased cotton production, has been initially controlled in the cooperative led by Qu Yaoli, a nationally renowned cotton planting model. Last year, despite heavy rain and waterlogging, it was still possible to prevent cotton seedlings from growing wildly, finally achieving a bumper harvest. This year, he plans to start turning to another new research topic—preventing cotton boll shedding. This new experiment will be conducted under his personal leadership in a specially designated 60-mu high-yield demonstration area, with fixed personnel carrying it out carefully.

Qu Yaoli narrated to the reporter with great interest his evaluation of this technological improvement. He said that if it is really possible to explore methods to reduce boll shedding, for which there is no mature experience in local cotton planting technology, it will greatly increase the unit yield of cotton. This old farmer, who has accumulated more than 20 years of cotton planting experience, had previously compared the phenomenon of boll shedding in cotton fields and found that reducing boll shedding by 10% increased the yield of cotton by 10%. Therefore, he decided to include this experiment in this year's work plan.

Wu Houli wants agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations to have "four joys" together.

In the meeting lounge, Wu Houli, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model, spoke freely to the reporter about the cooperative's plan to strive for "four joys" this year. The cooperative he leads—the Yangjingdi Red Star Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County—was once known throughout the country for its outstanding achievements in the overall planning of mountainous areas and soil and water conservation.

Wu Houli said: This year's agricultural production, in addition to continuing to process and increase fertilizer and improve management, will focus especially on the land far from the village. Last year, one-third of our cooperative's more than 1,500 mu of autumn land was not planted well, and the average yield per mu was half to two-thirds lower than that of the nearby land. This year, we will repair the edges of the land and improve the soil in these remote lands, plus the newly built river beaches and terraces will be harvested for the first time. The cooperative can increase the yield by 60 jin of grain per mu compared with last year, which is the first joy. This year is a big year for fruit trees and horticulture, so we must pay special attention to soil cultivation, pruning, and pest and disease control. The total output of pears, apples, and other fruits will increase by 100% compared with last year, which is the second joy. The number of livestock will increase by 25%, and the quality will also be greatly improved, which is the third joy. The types of sideline occupations will also increase with the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, which is the fourth joy.

When the reporter asked about the guarantees for achieving the production increase plan, Wu Houli smiled and handed over a copy of the original record material, which recorded the favorable conditions and production increase measures proposed by the cadres and members of their cooperative during the recent discussion of the plan. The cooperative will further improve production planning management and labor management according to the needs of production development. This year, we will better coordinate agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production and overcome the contradictions and waste of manpower and material resources among the three. When Wu Houli talked about the difficulties in increasing production this year, he said: The main worry is natural disasters, but even if we encounter natural disasters, this year's harvest will definitely be better than last year. Soil and water conservation projects are enough to withstand floods and torrential rains, and we have also made preparations for drought and insect pests. If they don't come, fine, but if they come, the advanced cooperative has the strength to deal with them!

Guo Yu'en wants to lead all the members of the cooperative to continue to move forward.

How to run the cooperative well on the basis of last year's disasters and continue to restore and develop production. This is a question that Guo Yu'en, director of the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Pingshun County, has been repeatedly thinking about recently without solving it. It was not until recently that he participated in the first provincial agricultural cooperative representatives conference and learned from the experiences of various places that he gradually clarified the direction of his efforts and strengthened his confidence in moving forward.

The reporter took advantage of the break in the meeting to visit him and ask him about this year's cooperative management and production increase plan. He said: Our goal this year is to adopt various methods to comprehensively prevent and control natural disasters, strive for a grain yield of 431 jin per mu of farmland in the cooperative, and double the income of the members, thoroughly compensating for the economic losses caused by the disaster and eliminating the unhappiness in people's minds. He went on to say that last year's big disaster certainly made us suffer, but it also taught us some knowledge and gave us a lot of lessons. This year, we will unite all the members of the cooperative and redouble our efforts to repair and build up the land damaged by water, and also plan to carry out land renovation and construction of protection projects. We will also excavate twice as many flood control channels as last year, and prepare early to prevent wind and insect disasters, to ensure an increase of 60,000 jin of grain. Finally, he said with confidence: "We will also better implement democratic management, overcome pessimistic and disappointed sentiments, give play to the initiative of every member of the cooperative, prepare to resist all disasters, and ensure that the advanced cooperative continues to move forward."

Shen Jilan wants to make sideline production fully bloom.

Shen Jilan, who is known throughout the country for leading women's production, also led all the female members of the cooperative to bravely fight the disaster and save themselves when the entire cooperative suffered a serious disaster last year, making outstanding contributions to the cooperative's increased production. The members praised them as "walking in step on the road to victory and never bowing their heads in the face of difficulties."

This time, the reporter went to visit Shen Jilan. She began by saying that sideline production played a major role in last year's disaster relief and self-help, giving all the members of the cooperative a lesson. This year, we plan to vigorously mobilize women to comprehensively develop sideline production while carrying out agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production. We will add three new avenues to the existing types of sideline occupations last year. We plan to raise 10 boxes of bees, feed 30 mats of silkworms, and develop from the 200 pigs currently in the cooperative to 700 pigs. Shen Jilan told reporters: Now the women in the cooperative have made scientific division of labor. In 1957, the women will show their talents in sideline occupations and must do what the members said: fully bloom and reap the benefits.

    老模范的新打算
    新华社记者　冯建伟　杨义　郭洁
    全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达、曲耀离、郭玉恩、申纪兰和武侯梨，最近在太原市举行的山西省农业生产合作社第一次代表会议上，又一次会见了。这次聚会，他们畅谈了如何使他们领导的农业生产合作社在今年争取大丰收的新打算。
    李顺达要“破烂”的土地继续增产
    记者走访李顺达的时候，他正在会上作报告。他领导的金星农林牧生产合作社，去年三灾三救，在土薄石厚的山地上，获得了每亩产粮四百斤的成绩，93％的社员都增加了收入。当他报告这些事迹的时候，会场上频频传出热烈的掌声。
    当他走下讲坛，和记者谈到今年的打算时，他沉默片刻后说：去年遭灾过重，今年增产有很多困难：地被大雨冲烂，房屋畜圈倒塌，缺乏燃料……，但是，我们从抗灾中学到了很多经验，全体社员情绪高昂，信心十足。我们要整修起全部被冲毁的土地，要加工增肥，还要修建谷坊，硬是要从这些破烂地里每亩收四百五十斤粮食，完成去年未达到的竞赛计划。
    李顺达说：为了完成这个计划，我们社目前正根据社员建议，改善组织领导。实行两级领导制度，彻底改进财务工作，在生产投资上主要依靠本社力量，尽量减少贷款和借外债。社里主要干部包干领导生产队，以生产指导生产。我个人准备长期深入一个生产队，缩短坐办公室的时间，增加和社员一起劳动的时间。并且深入指导改进财务管理工作。
    曲耀离要试验研究控制棉花落铃
    对棉花增产阻力最大的狂长现象，在全国著名植棉模范曲耀离领导的社里，已经初步取得防治经验。在去年雨多水涝的情况下，仍能制止棉苗狂长，终于获得丰收。今年他打算开始转向另一个新的研究课题——制止棉花落铃。这项新的试验将在专门划定的六十亩高产示范区中，由他亲自领导操作，固定专人慎重进行。
    曲耀离津津有味地向记者叙述了他对这项技术改进的评价。他说，如果真的能够探讨出在当地植棉技术上尚无成熟经验的减少脱铃的办法，就会大大提高棉花单位产量。这位积累了二十多年植棉经验的老农，过去在长期观察棉田脱铃现象中，曾逐株对比发现少脱一成铃，多收一成花的事实，因此，他决定今年把这项试验列入工作项目之中。
    武侯梨要农林牧副业“四喜”齐来
    在会议休息室里，全国著名农业劳动模范武侯梨对记者畅谈了今年社里要争取“四喜”一齐来的打算。他领导的社——平顺县羊井底红星农林牧生产合作社，曾以山区全面规划和进行水土保持的卓著成绩闻名全国。
    武侯梨说：今年的农业生产除继续加工增肥，改善管理外，特别在离村较远的地里下功夫。去年，我们社一千五百多亩秋地中有三分之一远地没种好，每亩平均产量比近地低一半到三分之二。今年要在这些远地里普遍修理地边、改良土壤，加上新修河滩和梯田第一次见收成，全社每亩可比去年增加六十斤粮食，这是第一喜。果树园艺今年是大年，要特别培土修枝、防治灾害，梨、苹果等总产量要比去年增产一倍，这是第二喜。牧畜数量要增加25％，质量也要大大提高，这是第三喜。副业种类随着农林牧业的发展也要增加，这是第四喜。
    当记者问到实现增产计划的保证时，武侯梨笑了笑，递过一份原始记录材料，上面记载他们社里的干部和社员最近讨论计划时提出的有利条件和增产措施。全社将根据生产发展的需要，进一步改善生产计划管理和劳动管理，今年要使全社农林牧业生产配合的更好，克服三者之间的矛盾和人力物力的浪费现象。武侯梨在谈到今年增产的困难时说：主要是怕闹天灾，但是就是遇到天灾，今年的收成一定会比去年好。洪水和暴雨有水土保持工程足能顶住，旱和虫灾也作好准备。不来便罢，来了，高级社有力量对付它！
    郭玉恩要领导全体社员继续前进
    如何在去年遭灾的基础上办好社，继续恢复和发展生产。这是平顺县“五一”农业社主任郭玉恩最近反复思考而没有解决了的问题。直到最近参加全省农业社第一次代表会议，学习了各地经验后，才逐渐明确努力方向，坚定了前进信心。
    记者趁会议休息空隙赶去拜访他，请他谈谈今年的办社和增产计划。他说：我们今年的目标要采用各种办法，全面防治自然灾害，争取全社农田每亩产粮四百三十一斤，社员收入增加一倍，彻底弥补灾害带来的经济损失和消除人们思想上的不愉快。他接着说，去年的大灾，固然让我们吃了苦头，但也长了些知识，得了不少教训。今年我们要团结全体社员，加倍努力，把被水冲坏的土地修补起来，垒起来，还计划进行土地整修和建筑防护工程，还要开挖比去年多一倍的防洪渠道，并且及早准备防治风、虫灾害，保证增产六万斤粮食。最后，他满怀信心地说：“我们还要更好的实行民主管理，克服悲观失望情绪，发挥每个社员的积极性，准备抗拒一切灾害，保证高级社继续前进。”
    申纪兰要使副业生产全面开花
    以领导妇女生产闻名全国的申纪兰，在去年全社遭遇严重灾害时，又带领全体女社员奋勇抗灾自救，为全社增产作了出色的贡献。社员称赞她们是“胜利路上齐步走，困难面前不低头”。
    这次，记者前去访问申纪兰。她开头就说，去年抗灾自救中副业生产顶了大事，给全社社员上了一课。今年我们准备在进行农、林、牧生产的同时，大力发动妇女全面地发展副业生产。在去年已有的副业种类中，再增添三项新门路。打算养上十箱蜜蜂、喂三十席家蚕，并且在全社现有二百只猪的基础上，发展到七百只。申纪兰告诉记者：现在全社妇女已经作了科学分工，1957年妇女们在副业上将大显身手，一定要作到像社员们说的那样：全面开花，结果得利。
