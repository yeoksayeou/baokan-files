Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, Washington dispatch: The U.S. Senate concluded the first week of discussions on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on the 23rd. The discussion process shows that the U.S. government wanted to organize senators to unanimously support this "doctrine," but did not succeed.

Senate Republican leader Knowland and Democratic leader Johnson have expressed support for the "Eisenhower Doctrine," but many senators, especially Democratic senators, attacked the government's plan both during and outside the sessions.

Senator Ellender worried that the Eisenhower plan might lead to war and demanded that the government not "rely on a policy of military deterrence" in the Middle East. Senator Douglas also said that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" makes "the possibility of war in the Middle East more certain" because "the Eisenhower Doctrine actually suggests increasing military power in this region."

Some congressmen criticized the Eisenhower plan for failing to solve the real problems of the Middle East. For example, Mansfield pointed out that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" "does not address the essence of the difficulties in the Middle East." He said, "I think it might be better to study things like the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Suez Canal issue, and the refugee problem."

Senator Ervin worried that the passage of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" would give the government too much power. He said that the purpose of this "doctrine" "is to turn the United States into a policeman of Middle Eastern countries." The Congressional resolution would give Dulles unlimited power in dealing with Middle Eastern countries.

The Senate's delay in passing Eisenhower's Middle East plan makes the U.S. government very uneasy. The U.S. government originally hoped that this plan could be passed by Congress before the end of January.

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, Washington dispatch: Senator O'Mahoney, chairman of the U.S. Senate subcommittee investigating the reasons for high oil prices, told reporters on the 22nd: "The Big Oil oligopoly has more influence on U.S. foreign policy than members of Congress."

O'Mahoney said that his subcommittee found some documents in the files of oil companies proving that on August 13, 1956, three days before the London Conference on the Suez Canal issue, Dulles and his former Undersecretary of State Hoover held a secret meeting at the State Department with representatives of the largest American oil monopoly capital with leases in the Near East. According to a report on the meeting by a representative of one of the oil companies, Dulles said at the meeting that "he understood the oil companies' particular concern about the nationalization issue and they wanted to know what his opinion was and what line he would take at the London conference..."

Commenting on the report, O'Mahoney said, "I think this document illustrates the close connection between the leaders of the oil oligopoly in the Middle East and the State Department, which implements U.S. foreign policy in the region." In his opinion, the oil companies "know more about the foreign policy we are pursuing in the Middle East than Congress does."

    据新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院23日结束了对“艾森豪威尔主义”的第一周的讨论。讨论的过程说明，美国政府想组织参议员一致支持这个“主义”，但是没有成功。
    参议院共和党领袖诺兰和民主党领袖约翰逊已经表示支持“艾森豪威尔主义”，但是许多参议员，特别是民主党的参议员却在会上和会外对政府的计划进行抨击。
    参议员埃伦德担心艾森豪威尔计划可能导致战争，他要求政府在中东问题上不要“指靠武力威慑政策”。参议员道格拉斯也说，“艾森豪威尔主义”使“中东发生战争的可能性更肯定了”，因为“艾森豪威尔主义实际上是建议在这一地区增加军事力量”。
    一些议员批评了艾森豪威尔计划不能解决真正的中东问题。例如，曼斯菲尔德指出，“艾森豪威尔主义”“并没有涉及中东困难的实质”。他说，“我认为研究一下诸如阿拉伯—以色列冲突，苏伊士运河问题，难民问题这类东西或许更好一些。”
    参议员欧文担心通过“艾森豪威尔主义”将使政府的权力过大。他说，这个“主义”的目的“是要把美国变成中东国家的警察”。国会的决议将使杜勒斯在对待中东国家方面有无限的权力。
    参议院迟迟没有通过艾森豪威尔的中东计划使美国政府非常不安。美国政府本来是希望这个计划在1月底以前就能够在国会通过的。
    据新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院研究石油价格高涨原因的小组委员会的主席、参议员奥马洪尼22日对新闻记者说：“大石油同业公会对美国的外交政策所产生的影响比国会议员还要大。”
    奥马洪尼说，他的小组委员会在石油公司的档案中找到了一些文件，这些文件证明，在1956年8月13日，就是就苏伊士运河问题召开伦敦会议前三天，杜勒斯和他以前的副国务卿胡佛同在中近东拥有租借权的美国最大石油垄断资本的代表在国务院举行了一次秘密会议。据其中一个石油公司的代表在关于这次会议的报告书指出，杜勒斯在这次会议上曾经说，“他明白各石油公司对国有化问题表示特别关心，它们想知道，他的意见是怎样的，他在伦敦会议上又将采取什么样的路线……。”
    奥马洪尼评述这个报告书的时候说，“我认为，这个文件正说明了在中东的石油同业公会领导人同在这个地区实行美国外交政策的国务院之间有着密切的联系。”根据他的看法，各石油公司“对我们在中东所采取的外交政策比国会了解得更多”。
