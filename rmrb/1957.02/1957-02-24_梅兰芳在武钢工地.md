    梅兰芳在武钢工地
    据新华社讯　20和21日晚上，著名表演艺术家梅兰芳，以他多年精心修改、整理的古典歌舞剧——“贵妃醉酒”，在武钢工地为建设者们作了两场慰问演出。
    梅兰芳精湛的表演，不止一次地博得观众春雷般的掌声。演出后，梅兰芳六次谢幕，热情沸腾的建设者们还不愿散去，纷纷拥向台口，鼓掌欢呼。梅兰芳卸妆以后，又特地走出前台，和大家见面。他容光焕发地对建设者们说，我来到武钢工地给大家演出，感到光荣。几年后，全厂落成时我们还要再来向你们道喜。
    工地建设者们把一面绣有“热心为基建服务”字样的紫红色金丝绒锦旗和一束束鲜花，在演出结束时献给梅兰芳。梅兰芳和工地建筑职工合影留念。
