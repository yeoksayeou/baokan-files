Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. According to TASS: The Soviet-Finnish communiqué signed in Moscow on February 2nd stated that good and sincere good-neighborly relations are maintained between the Soviet Union and Finland, and no external events should be allowed to affect this relationship. Soviet-Finnish relations have developed well in the spirit of the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed in 1948, and it is in the vital interests of both countries to continue to firmly maintain this relationship.
The publication of the Soviet-Finnish communiqué is the result of talks between Finnish Prime Minister Fagerholm and Soviet government leaders in Moscow from January 31st to February 2nd. The communiqué, signed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Bulganin and Finnish Prime Minister Fagerholm, pointed out that the talks further deepened mutual understanding between the two countries and once again demonstrated the spirit of mutual respect and trust between the two countries.
The communiqué said: The Soviet side affirmed that Finland's peaceful, neutral foreign policy and its friendly relations with all countries greatly contribute to ensuring international peace.
The two governments believe that good-neighborly relations among the Nordic countries, which are in the interests of European peace, are of great significance for consolidating international peace, and therefore, they are willing to work hard to promote the achievement of this goal.
The two governments also believe that, under the current circumstances, it is of great significance to achieve practical results in disarmament, especially in banning atomic and hydrogen weapons under appropriate international control.
The communiqué pointed out that the relations between the Soviet Union and Finland in trade, culture, scientific and technological cooperation, sports, etc., have reached a broad scale and are developing smoothly. At the same time, some practical issues related to further promoting mutually beneficial trade between the two countries have also been resolved. Both sides confirmed that, within the overall scope of Soviet-Finnish trade, the necessary preconditions for restoring the traditional trade relations between Finland and the Leningrad region now exist.
The communiqué finally pointed out the importance of direct talks between the national leaders of the Soviet Union and Finland. Prime Minister Fagerholm, on behalf of the Finnish President and government, extended an invitation to Bulganin and Khrushchev, member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, hoping that they would visit Finland. Bulganin and Khrushchev have accepted the invitation and decided to visit Finland this spring.
The Finnish Prime Minister and his entourage traveled to Leningrad on February 3rd and will return home from there on February 6th.
