Stepping into the Crop Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition, one is immediately greeted by the exhibit tower in the center of the hall, adorned with rice ears, wheat ears, and other crop stalks. On either side of this hall, bundles of rice and wheat are displayed, along with corn cobs over a foot long and as thick as an arm, giant sweet potatoes weighing over ten pounds each, potatoes, both yellow and rose-red, larger than fists, and a wide variety of minor grains and oil crops… What a vivid and wonderful picture of a bountiful harvest!

Rice Family Across the Country

Rice is China's most important grain crop, with a long history of cultivation. Our country began planting rice as early as five thousand years ago. Chinese farmers have rich experience in rice cultivation. Rice is widely distributed, and every province in the country, except Qinghai where it is being tried out, is capable of growing it. Among these, the central and southern provinces account for about 95% of the total rice cultivation area. There are many types of rice, including indica rice, japonica rice, glutinous rice, as well as dryland rice and deep-water rice. The varieties are even more diverse, with approximately over ten thousand throughout the country. Here, we can see over fifty excellent early and late rice varieties such as Nantao No. 1, Victory Indica, Yin Fang, and Old Laqing. In addition, there is "Purple Rice," blackish-purple, sent from Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces, and multi-embryo rice, where one grain can yield three kernels.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, rice production has greatly developed. Charts show that from 1949 to 1956, the rice planting area increased by 173,855,000 mu, and the yield per unit area increased by 88.9 jin. Calculated by the total planting area, the average yield per mu in 1956 reached 472.3 jin, and the total output reached 70.95 billion jin. Some people believe that the harvest is the result of favorable weather. Many typical examples introduced in the exhibition will help them draw the correct conclusion. Yiliang County in Yunnan Province is a small plain surrounded by mountains, with an altitude of over 1,500 meters. In the past, water and fertilizer were insufficient. In 1956, due to the implementation of "two guarantees," "five changes," and "one prevention" under the conditions of collectivization, more than 10,000 mu of single-season rice in the county achieved a high yield of 778 jin per mu. The experience of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province in actively fighting against nature to increase rice production is also relatively prominent. Many hills and mountains are within the autonomous prefecture, with an altitude of about 500 meters, an average annual temperature of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius, and a frost-free period of less than 150 days. The natural conditions are obviously not good. However, local farmers selected different varieties according to local conditions, transplanted seedlings early, and universally planted densely. The prefecture’s 490,000 mu of single-season rice achieved a yield of 497 jin per mu.

The exhibition also showcases high-yield examples of dryland rice and deep-water rice. Many visitors are quite interested in the deep-water rice with plants over ten feet tall. Deep-water rice is highly water-resistant and can be planted in deep water of two to eight feet, and can continue to grow as the water level rises, reaching up to fifteen feet at its tallest. Currently, there are about one million mu of deep-water rice throughout the country, mainly distributed in Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hebei, and other places. The general yield is 200 to 500 jin per mu; two mu of deep-water rice in Anfeng Cooperative in Anxiang County, Hunan Province, yielded over 1,000 jin per mu. Using lake marshes to grow deep-water rice is one of the ways to increase grain production in lake marsh areas.

Wheat is not a "Low-Yield Crop"

The second part of this pavilion showcases various wheat varieties. The large number of exhibits here tell people that wheat, like rice, is one of the main foods of the Chinese people. It is widely distributed, from Taiwan to Xinjiang, from Heilongjiang to the Yarlung Zangbo River, except for high-altitude cold regions above 3,800 meters. In recent years, wheat production has also been developing rapidly. The charts hanging in the pavilion tell us that the sown area, yield per unit area, and total output of wheat in 1956 all exceeded the targets of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule; and many large-scale high-yield examples have emerged. Under the large headline "The 800 Li Qin Chuan Reaps a Bountiful Wheat Harvest Every Year," many golden wheat bundles and bottles of plump wheat grains are displayed. From the charts, it can be seen that the rate of wheat production increase in Shaanxi Province is very fast, and the achievements are enormous. In 1956, the province sown over 20 million mu of wheat; due to the promotion of the improved variety "Bima No. 1" and various advanced high-yield experiences, despite suffering severe rain damage, a large-scale harvest was still achieved, with an average yield of 197 jin per mu; seven counties including Wugong, Chang'an, Lantian, Weinan, Sanyuan, Gaoling, Huaxian and two cities, Xi'an and Baoji, had an average yield of over 300 jin per mu; among them, twenty-six agricultural cooperatives had a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. A wheat yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, this was simply unimaginable in the past! Visitors also watched with suppressed excitement the introduction of Zhangye County, Gansu Province, creating a new national record for large-scale high-yield wheat production. Due to the adoption of Wugong "774" improved varieties, improved irrigation management methods, changing from broadcast sowing to strip sowing, increased fertilizer application, and prevention and control of wheat smut disease, the county's 300,000 mu of wheat yielded 382 jin per mu in 1956.

The exhibition also introduced the experience of some areas with double-cropping rice and wheat harvests. Zhenze County in Jiangsu is a double-cropping rice and wheat area. The county's rice yield in 1956 was 629 jin per mu, and the average yield of over 50,000 mu of wheat in the county was over 200 jin per mu, an increase of about double compared to 1955.

In the face of these many materials, who can still say that wheat is a "low-yield crop"?

Rich and Colorful Minor Grains

Corn with kernels as full as pearls, heavy millet, huge sweet potatoes and potatoes, attract visitors to the display of minor grains. Many visitors are very satisfied to see that the exhibition can use the method of comparing objects in kind to introduce the experience of significantly increasing yield by using inter-varietal hybridization and cultivating inter-line hybrids of corn. The exhibits also introduced: the results of experiments in eleven places in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, proving that artificial assisted pollination is also an effective method for increasing corn production.

The exhibition also showcased many high-yield examples of corn. Due to careful seed selection, phased fertilization, early planting and intercropping, and timely watering, Huang County in Shandong had a yield of 500 jin per mu on 270,000 mu of corn. Han Junchang, a labor model in Yanshi, Henan, adopted the method of "three attacks" fertilization based on the growth and development characteristics of crops, and has maintained a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu for five consecutive years. Here, I saw several members of the Shanxi visiting delegation, who came to the capital specifically to visit the National Agricultural Exhibition, listening intently to the explanation of the docent and taking notes in their notebooks.

Millet has always been considered a "low-yield crop," and the planting area has been shrinking in recent years. However, here we can see: Youyi Agricultural Cooperative in Ziyang County, Shandong Province, has achieved yields of over 1,000 jin per mu every year since 1953 due to improved farming and cultivation methods. It can be seen that its potential for increased production is also considerable.

Root crops are a high-yield crop and have developed rapidly in recent years, and a considerable number of high-yield cooperatives have emerged. In 1956, Dengta No. 1 Cooperative in Fan County, Shandong, had a yield of 8,157 jin per mu on 170 mu of spring sweet potatoes and 4,300 jin per mu on 770 mu of summer sweet potatoes. The large sweet potatoes weighing over 100 jin per plant, obtained by grafting morning glory and sweet potatoes by the South China Agricultural Science Institute, are particularly endearing, and are surrounded by layers of visitors.

The minor grains section also displays more than twenty kinds of beans and minor grains with various shapes and beautiful colors. Among them are the famous Mingguang mung beans in Anhui, Daming mung beans and red beans in Hebei, broad beans from Sichuan, Qinghai and Zhangjiakou, which are all valuable legacies passed down by our ancestors for many years. They contain nutritious fats and proteins, taste good, and are an important source of plant protein for people, and can be used to make a wide variety of nutritious non-staple foods based on the characteristics of different varieties. Various beans are not only necessities in people's lives, but also good preceding crops for various crops (with root nodules that can increase soil fertility), and can also be planted on the edges of fields and in open spaces, with great potential for development.

Oilseeds are an Infinite Source

The last part of this pavilion is oil crops. Here, the high-yield experiences and excellent variety specimens of various oil crops such as soybeans and peanuts are exhibited, as well as more than 30 kinds of edible and industrial oils. Oils such as fennel oil, Chinese toon seed oil, smartweed seed oil, flax seed oil, perilla seed oil, and cocklebur seed oil, which have only been discovered in recent years, have aroused great interest among visitors.

Soybean originated in China and has a cultivation history of four to five thousand years. China's soybeans are not only high in yield, but also of good quality, and have long been famous in the world. Soybeans have a wide range of uses. They are not only an important raw material for staple foods, non-staple foods, and edible oil for the Chinese people, but also occupy an important position in many industrial sectors. The exhibition displays ping pong balls, paints, inks, synthetic gasoline, soaps, glass combs, etc., pointing out to people that these things contain soybean components; it is currently known that soybeans have at least 200 industrial uses.

From the perspective of cultivation history, peanuts are not as long-standing as soybeans; however, because peanuts are the most oil-rich crop, with seeds containing 50% to 60% oil, one and a half to two times higher than soybeans, they have developed rapidly. In 1956, the sown area accounted for 13.54% of the total area of oil crops. Peanuts have a strong ability to adapt to the soil and can be cultivated on clay soil and even sandy soil. The exhibition features the high-yield experience of the three cooperatives of Unity, Voluntary, and Progress in Penglai County, Shandong Province, with peanut yields of over 370 jin per mu (more than twice the national average). In addition, high-yield experiences of rapeseed, sesame, flax, etc. are also exhibited. Sesame is the raw material for sesame oil, which people love to use for seasoning, and the national average yield per mu is only 49 jin; however, the exhibited materials show that its yield per unit area can still be greatly increased. Henan has an agricultural cooperative that created a new record of over 300 jin of sesame per mu. It can be seen from this part of the exhibits that increasing the yield per unit area is the main key to increasing oil crop production; in addition, using the sides of houses and slopes to plant crops such as sunflowers and castor beans is also one of the ways to increase oil production.

The Crop Pavilion has a large map, which indicates the yield targets per mu of grain land in the three categories of regions stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967. The text explanation next to the map states: In the areas where the target is set at 800 jin, seven counties have reached and exceeded 800 jin in one year; in the areas where the target is set at 400 jin and 500 jin, five counties and one city have reached and exceeded 400 jin and 500 jin in one year. These materials fully illustrate that as long as all localities can rely on the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives, earnestly implement the policy of adapting to local conditions in improving technology, actively learn advanced high-yield experiences, actively build farmland water conservancy and implement other production-increasing measures, the glorious task stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) will certainly be realized.

    多采的粮食油料丰收图
    ——记全国农业展览会农作物一馆
    邵礼昆
    走进全国农业展览会农作物一馆大门，首先呈现在人们面前的，是那座耸立在大厅中央的用稻穗、麦穗和别的作物穗茎镶制成的展品塔。这个馆的两旁，陈列着一捆捆的水稻、麦子，一尺多长手臂那样粗的玉米穗，一块就有十多斤重的大甘薯，比拳头还大得多的黄色和玫瑰红的马铃薯，种类繁多的小杂粮和油料作物……——多么鲜明、多么美妙的一幅巨大的丰收图！
    水稻家族遍全国
    水稻，是我国最重要的粮食作物，有悠久的栽培历史，早在五千年前，我国就种了稻子。我国农民有丰富的种植水稻的经验。水稻分布很广，全国除青海正在试种外，没有一个省不能种植。其中我国中部和南部各省水稻种植面积约占它的总面积的95％。水稻种类很多，有籼稻、粳稻、糯稻，还有陆稻、深水稻。品种更是丰富多样，全国约有一万多个。我们在这里可以看到南特号、胜利籼、银坊、老来青等五十多个优良的早稻和晚稻品种。此外，还可以看到从云南省和广西省送来的紫得发黑的“紫米”和一粒谷可以碾出三粒米的多胚稻。
    全国解放以来，我国的水稻有了很大的发展。图表显示，从1949年到1956年，水稻的种植面积增加了一亿七百三十八万五千亩，单位面积产量增加了八十八点九斤。按种植总面积计算，1956年平均每亩产量已经达到四百七十二点三斤，总产量已经达到七百零九亿五千万斤。有人以为：丰收是风调雨顺的结果。展览会里介绍的许多典型会帮助他得出正确结论。云南宜良县是四面环山的小平坝，海拔在一千五百公尺以上，历年水源、肥料都不足。1956年，由于在合作化的条件下实行了“两保”“五改”“一防”，全县一万多亩单季稻获得亩产七百七十八斤的高额产量。吉林延边朝鲜族自治州积极向自然作斗争增产了稻谷的经验，也是比较突出的。这个自治州境内很多丘陵、山地，海拔五百公尺左右，年平均温度为摄氏二至四度，无霜期不足一百五十天，自然条件显然是不好的。可是，当地农民因地选用不同品种，提早插秧和普遍密植，全州四十九万亩单季稻，亩产量达到了四百九十七斤。
    展览会还展出了陆稻和深水稻的丰产典型。许多参观者对植株高达一丈多的深水稻颇感兴趣。深水稻耐水性强，可以在二尺至八尺的深水中栽植，能随水位提高而不断生长，最高可达一丈五尺。目前全国约有深水稻一百万亩，主要分布在湖南、湖北、广东、云南、河北等地，一般亩产二百到五百斤；湖南安乡县安丰社两亩深水稻亩产千斤以上。利用湖沼泽地种植深水稻，是湖沼地区增产粮食的门路之一。
    麦子不是“低产作物”
    这个馆的第二部分，展出了各种麦类。这里大量的展品告诉人们：小麦和水稻一样，也是我国人民的主要食粮之一。它的分布很广，从台湾到新疆，从黑龙江到雅鲁藏布江，除了海拔在三千八百公尺以上的高寒地带以外，各地都有。近几年，小麦生产也在迅速发展。馆中悬挂的图表告诉我们：在1956年小麦的播种面积、单位产量、总产量都提前超额完成了第一个五年计划的指标；并且涌现出许多大面积的丰产典型。在“八百里秦川年年麦丰收”的大字标题下面，陈列着许多金黄色的麦捆和一瓶瓶肥硕的麦粒。从图表上可以看出，陕西省小麦产量增加速度是很快的，成绩是很巨大的。1956年全省共播种二千多万亩小麦；由于推广良种“碧玛一号”和各项先进丰产经验，在遭受了严重雨害情况下，仍然获得大面积丰收，平均亩产一百九十七斤；平均亩产在三百斤以上的有武功、长安、蓝田、渭南、三原、高陵、华县等七个县和西安、宝鸡两个市；其中并有二十六个农业社亩产千斤以上。小麦亩产一千多斤，这在过去简直是不可能想像的！参观者还怀着抑制不住的兴奋心情，观看了甘肃张掖县创造全国大面积小麦丰产新纪录的介绍。这个县由于采用武功“774”良种、改进灌溉管理方法、改撒播为条播、增施肥料和防治小麦黑穗病等等，1956年全县三十多万亩小麦亩产三百八十二斤。
    展览会还介绍了有些地区稻麦两熟丰收的经验。江苏震泽县是稻麦两熟区。这个县1956年水稻产量每亩六百二十九斤，全县五万多亩小麦平均亩产二百斤以上，比1955年增加一倍左右。
    在这许多材料面前，小麦谁还能再说是“低产作物”？
    丰富多采的杂粮
    籽粒饱满得像珍珠般的玉米和沉甸甸的谷子，硕大的甘薯和马铃薯，吸引着参观者走到了陈列杂粮的部分。许多参观者看到展览会能用实物对比的方法，介绍利用玉米品种间杂交和培育自交系间杂交显著增产的经验很满意。展品还介绍了：山西榆次县在十一个地方的试验结果证明，人工辅助授粉也是使玉米增产的有效方法。
    展览会还展出了许多玉米丰产典型。山东黄县由于精细选种、分期施肥、早种间作和适时浇水，全县二十七万多亩玉米亩产五百斤。河南偃师劳模韩俊昌根据作物的生长发育的特点，采用“三攻”施肥的方法，连续五年保持亩产千斤以上。在这里，我看到特地到首都来参观全国农业展览会的山西参观团的几个团员聚精会神地倾听讲解员的讲解，还把它记在本子上。
    粟谷一向也被认为是“低产作物”，播种面积历年来都在缩小。但是，我们在这里可以看到：山东滋阳县友谊农业社由于改进耕作和栽培方法，自1953年起，每年都亩产千斤以上。可见它的增产潜力也是不小的。
    薯类是一种高产作物，近年来发展得很快，并且出现了为数不少的高额丰产社。山东范县灯塔一社，在1956年，一百七十多亩春甘薯亩产八千一百五十七斤，七百七十多亩夏甘薯亩产四千三百多斤。华南农业科学研究所用月光花和甘薯嫁接而获得每株的块根重达一百多斤的大甘薯，特别惹人喜爱，在它旁边围满了一层层参观的人们。
    在杂粮部分还陈列着形状和色泽繁多而美丽的二十多种豆类小杂粮。其中有著名的安徽明光绿豆，河北大明绿豆、红小豆，四川、青海及张家口的大蚕豆等，都是我们的先人多年来留传下来的宝贵遗产。它们含有营养丰富的脂肪和蛋白质，味道又好，是供给人们植物性蛋白质的重要来源，又可根据不同品种的特点来制成花色众多，营养丰富的副食品。各种豆类既是人民生活中必需品，又是各种作物的良好前作（有根瘤可使土壤肥力增加），还可以利用田边隙地来种植，很有发展前途。
    油料有无穷的泉源
    这个馆的最后一部分是油料作物。在这里展览的，有大豆、花生等各种油料作物的丰产经验、优良品种标本，另外还有食用及工业用油三十种以上。像茴油、椿树籽油、蓼籽油、线麻籽油、苏籽油、苍耳籽油等等，都是最近几年才发现的，更引起参观者莫大的兴趣。
    大豆为我国原产，已有四五千年的栽培历史。我国的大豆，不仅产量高，而且品质好，久已闻名于世界。大豆用途极广，它不仅是我国人民重要的主食品、副食品和食用油的原料，在许多工业部门中也占重要的位置。展览会陈列了乒乓球、油漆、油墨、人造汽油、香皂、玻璃梳子等，向人们指出：这些东西都含有大豆的成分；目前已知大豆的工业用途至少在二百种以上。
    花生，从栽培历史来看，远不及大豆的悠久；但是，因为花生是最富于油份的作物，种子含油量达50％—60％，比大豆高一倍半到两倍，所以发展得很快，1956年播种面积已占油料作物总面积13.54％。花生适应土壤的能力强，在粘土以至砂土上，都可以栽培。这里展览了山东蓬莱县团结、自愿、前进三个社花生亩产三百七十斤以上（比全国平均产量高出一倍以上）的丰产经验。另外，还展出了油菜、芝麻、亚麻等丰产经验。芝麻，是人们最爱用来调味的香油的原料，全国平均每亩产量只有四十九斤；可是，展出的材料说明：它的单位产量也还是可以大大提高的，河南就有一个农业社创造了亩产芝麻三百多斤的新纪录。从这一部分展品可以看出：提高单位产量是油料作物增产的主要关键；另外，利用屋旁、坡地种植向日葵、蓖麻等作物，也是增加油料的途径之一。
    农作物一馆有一幅大地图，上面标明1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）规定的三类地区每亩粮田的产量指标。地图旁边的文字说明：在指标定为八百斤的地区，一年间达到和超过八百斤的县已经有七个；在指标定为四百斤和五百斤地区，一年间达到和超过四百斤五百斤的单位计有五县一市。这些材料充分地说明了，只要各地都能依靠农业社的集体力量，在改进技术上认真贯彻执行因地制宜的方针，积极学习先进丰产经验，积极兴修农田水利和实行别的增产措施，全国农业发展纲要（草案）所规定的光荣任务是一定能够实现的。
