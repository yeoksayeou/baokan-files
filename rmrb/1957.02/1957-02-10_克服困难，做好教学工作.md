    Overcoming Difficulties and Doing a Good Job in Teaching
	Li Youshan, Director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University

    This academic year, the number of students in colleges and universities has increased sharply, and the problem of school buildings is very tight. However, by adopting the two-shift system, the utilization rate of buildings has been improved, and the students' extracurricular homework time has been concentrated, which saves both buildings and time. Many schools have also rationally adjusted living and teaching rooms, so that the problem of school buildings has been basically solved. This is very good. We should continue to overcome difficulties and carry forward the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily in the future. Now I would like to put forward some personal opinions on how colleges and universities should run schools diligently and thriftily.
    In terms of teaching instruments and equipment, schools should pay attention to giving play to the role of teaching equipment and improving their utilization rate. Relevant enterprises can, under possible conditions, engage in some representative production for experimental research needs; they can also engage in trial production of some new products. Schools can use the same equipment to offer more experiments and reduce the duplication of instruments and equipment.
    Whether the equipment in the laboratory should be put into formal production is a question worth studying, because it involves the maintenance of the equipment and the guarantee of the completion of teaching tasks. However, if the role of the equipment is not actively brought into play, even if its integrity can be guaranteed, it will no longer be a new type of equipment in a few years. From the perspective of teaching, new things are also needed to replace them, or the old ones can be modified or improved. Therefore, it is very important to make full use of existing equipment. In solving this problem, I suggest that colleges and universities can add some technicians to use these equipment to manufacture instruments for scientific research; at the same time, industrial departments can cooperate with colleges and universities to jointly exploit the potential of college equipment.
    The problem of material supply is difficult for a single school to solve. It can be solved by the Higher Education Department or by cooperation between colleges and universities and industrial departments. In recent years, in order to cooperate with the development of experiments and scientific research, Tsinghua University has vigorously carried out the self-design and manufacture of application instruments, because some instruments are not formally produced at home and abroad, or the ordering time is too long, or they are simply not available on the market. Self-designing and manufacturing instruments can save foreign exchange, reduce the non-formal production tasks of production plants, and also give play to the potential of mechanical equipment in school teaching. Sometimes we can also manufacture some application machines for industrial departments during school internships. For example, in the teaching practice of the Metal Engineering course in 1956, about 200 water pumps were manufactured for industrial departments, which were exchanged for steel and necessary machines and equipment for teaching worth about 50,000 yuan. For example, the Radio Department has self-made a lot of equipment for experiments since 1952, which has met the needs of opening courses. However, in the process of exploiting the potential of school machines and solving the instrument manufacturing by ourselves, we have also encountered great difficulties. For example, in the supply of various necessary metal materials, the materials needed by the school for instrument manufacturing and scientific research are all small in quantity (such as the demand for alloy steel is generally only dozens of kilograms), but the types needed are more, the specifications are more complicated, and the time required is tight, and most of them cannot accurately formulate plans in advance half a year ago. When it is necessary to purchase materials temporarily, it is impossible to achieve the goal due to the small quantity, many types, and urgent time, coupled with the shortage of technicians, resulting in the failure to exert mechanical potential. These problems need to be further solved.
    In addition, among the colleges and universities in a region, it is necessary to pay attention to avoiding the duplication of laboratory types and the duplication of equipment, and to achieve mutual assistance and cooperation, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, in order to further exploit the potential of the laboratory. Especially in the planning of new laboratories in the future, each school should consider it.
    In addition to experimental equipment, the utilization rate of books and materials should also be greatly improved, especially the rare publications in the country or those subscribed from abroad, and each school should make mutual adjustments. Each school can exchange book catalogs with each other, open reading rooms, strive to improve the utilization rate of books and materials, and try to avoid duplication in procurement. If appropriate arrangements can be made in this regard, a lot of funds can be saved for the country.
    How to solve the problem that the supply of teachers cannot keep up with the needs of teaching? I think the first thing is to give play to the potential of teachers. Various methods can be adopted, such as large classes, part-time teaching, adjacent schools organizing joint classes, reducing the types of basic courses, mutual support between inter-school teaching and research groups of the same nature, and so on. These methods can be adopted separately in combination with specific circumstances. Secondly, it is necessary to train and enrich the necessary teachers and teaching assistants. Some courses (such as basic courses such as mechanics) should be specially arranged by the Higher Education Department to train teachers in order to shorten the learning years and ensure the unity of learning and application. The school should help teaching assistants improve their professional level in order to reduce the teachers' administrative burden and facilitate the improvement of teaching quality. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen the planning of cadre training, and a comprehensive plan should be made for the number and categories of cadres needed. For example, the source of engineers is not only supplied by higher industrial schools, but a large number of secondary technical school graduates and workers have the potential to become engineers after being trained and improved in their work. If these factors are estimated, a plan for training talents can be correctly formulated. In order to improve the quality of students, it is necessary to reasonably control the quantity, and to meet the country's needs for construction talents. The majors among colleges and universities should avoid duplication as much as possible in order to concentrate efforts to train higher-quality cadres.
    In scientific research work, it is necessary to distinguish between primary and secondary, and avoid average development. Schools and research institutions should communicate with each other, cooperate with each other, avoid duplication, and save manpower and material resources. Teaching and scientific research must conform to the characteristics of colleges and universities, and research work should be carried out on the basis of ensuring that teaching work is done well. In terms of the content of research, schools can encourage teachers to conduct research on teaching methods. This is beneficial to promoting teaching work.

    克服困难，做好教学工作	清华大学机械制造系主任　李酉山
    这一学年高等学校学生人数骤增，校舍问题十分紧张，但由于采用了二部制上课的办法，提高了房屋的使用率，又使学生的课外作业时间集中起来，既节约了房屋，也节约了时间。许多学校并且合理地调剂了生活用房和教学用房，使校舍问题基本上解决了。这是很好的。我们今后应当继续克服困难，发扬勤俭办学的精神。我现在就高等学校应当如何勤俭办学，提出一些个人意见。
    在供教学使用的仪器设备方面，学校应当注意发挥教学设备的作用和提高它们的使用率。有关企业部门在可能的条件下，可以从事一些供试验研究方面需要的代表的生产；还可以从事一些新产品的试制工作。学校可以利用同样设备开出更多的试验，减少重复的仪器设备。
    实验室的设备是否投入正规生产，这是值得研究的一个问题，因为它牵涉到设备的保养和保证教学任务的完成。但是，若不积极发挥设备的作用，即使能保证它们的完好，但再过几年它们已经不是什么新型设备了。从教学方面来说，也需要更新的东西来代替它们，或把旧的加以改装或改进。所以，充分使用现有设备是非常重要的。在解决这个问题时，我建议高等学校可添些技工来使用这些设备，为科学研究制造仪器；同时，产业部门可以和高等学校合作，共同发挥高等学校设备的潜力。
    关于材料供应问题，某一个学校是难以解决的，可以由高等教育部设法解决，或由高等学校和产业部门合作来解决。清华大学近几年来为了配合实验和科学研究工作的开展，大力进行应用仪器的自行设计与制造，因为有些仪器国内外都不正式生产，或者订制时间太长，或者根本是市场上买不到的。自行设计制造仪器，可以节省外汇，减少生产厂的非正规生产任务，同时也发挥了学校教学上机械设备的潜力。有时我们还可在校内实习时，代产业部门制造一些应用机器。如1956年金属工学课程的教学实习中，就为产业部门代制水泵约二百台，换回来钢材和教学上必需的机器设备约值五万元。又如无线电系自1952年以来自制很多实验用的设备，满足了开课的需要。但是，在发挥校内机器潜力，来自行解决仪器制造的过程中，我们也碰到了很大的困难。例如，在各种必需金属材料等的供应方面，学校对仪器制造和科学研究中所需要的材料都是少量的（如合金钢等的需要量一般只是几十公斤），但需要的种类较多，规格较繁，而需要的时间又较紧，多半不能在半年以前预先正确地制订计划。临时需要采购材料，又因数量少，种类多，时间急而达不到目的，再加上技术工人不足，致使机械潜力不能发挥。这些问题还要进一步设法解决。
    此外，在一个地区内的高等学校中，需要注意避免实验室类型的重复和设备的重复，要做到互助合作，取长补短，来进一步发挥实验室的潜力。尤其是对今后新建实验室的规划上，各学校更应当有所考虑。
    除实验设备外，图书资料利用率也要大大提高，尤其是全国稀有的或向国外订阅的刊物，更要做到各学校互相调剂。各学校可以相互交换图书目录，开放阅览室，努力提高图书资料的利用率，极力避免采购上的重复。在这方面如果能适当安排，就可为国家节省大量的资金。
    如何解决师资供应赶不上教学需要的问题？我觉得首先要发挥教师的潜力，可以采取各种办法，如大班上课，兼课，相邻各校组织共同开课，减少基本性课程的类型，同性质教研组的校际之间互相支援，等等。这些办法，可以结合具体情况分别采用。其次，要培养和充实必要的师资和教学辅助人员。某些课程（如力学等基础课程）应由高等教育部专门设法培养师资，以缩减学习年限，保证学用一致。学校要帮助教学辅助人员提高业务水平，以减轻教师的事务性负担，便于提高教学质量。此外，还要加强培养干部的计划性，对于干部需要数量和类别应全面地进行计划。例如工程师的来源不仅仅由高等工业学校源源供应，大量的中等技术学校毕业生和工人，在工作中得到锻炼和提高，都有可能成为工程师的条件。把这些因素估计进去，就可正确拟定培养人材的计划。为了提高学生的质量，就要合理地控制数量，并要做到满足国家对建设人材的需要。各高等学校间的专业，要尽量避免重复，才能集中力量培养质量较高的干部。
    在科学研究工作方面，必须分清主次，避免平均发展。各学校间和各研究机关间要互通消息，互相分工合作；避免重复，节省人力物力。教学与科学研究必须符合高等学校的特点，在保证教学工作做好的基础上开展研究工作。在研究的内容上，学校可以鼓励教师进行有关教学方法的研究。这对推动教学工作是有好处的。
