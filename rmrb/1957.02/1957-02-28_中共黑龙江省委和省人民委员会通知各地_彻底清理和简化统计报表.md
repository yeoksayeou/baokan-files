    CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and Provincial People's Committee Notify All Regions to Thoroughly Clean Up and Simplify Statistical Reports
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee issued a joint notice to all directly affiliated departments, local committees, special offices, municipal committees, county committees, people's committees, and factory and mine party committees on February 7th, requiring a thorough clean-up and simplification of statistical reports.
    The notice pointed out that the current number of statistical reports is exceptionally large, causing a lot of trouble for grassroots units and wasting a lot of manpower and material resources. In order to practice thrift and overcome bureaucracy, it is necessary to thoroughly simplify all reports issued by various departments and change the phenomenon of excessive reports.
    The notice stipulates that the scope of the cleanup includes: Party and government statistical reports, survey outlines that create a statistical burden, various forms of statistical data, etc., regardless of whether they have been approved through procedures, should be thoroughly cleaned up. Provincial departments are required to reduce the statistical workload of reports by 50% to 60% compared with the previous year; the reports issued by various cities and counties are required to be reduced by 70% compared with the previous year.
    In order to ensure that the work of cleaning up and simplifying statistical reports in the province is carried out in a thorough and in-depth manner, the notice charges the Provincial Bureau of Statistics with the overall organization and leadership of this work.
    In addition, the notice also stipulates the future approval methods for forms, the supply of statistical data, and ensuring the uniformity of statistical figures. It is expected that this work will be fully completed in late March.

    本报讯　中共黑龙江省委员会、黑龙江省人民委员会于2月7日向各直属部门，各地委、专署，各市委、县委、人民委员会和厂矿党委发出联合通知，要求彻底清理、简化统计报表。
    通知指出，当前统计报表异常繁多，给基层单位增加了不少麻烦，浪费了许多人力和物力。为了厉行节约，克服文牍主义，必须彻底地简化各部门所制发的一切报表，改变报表过多的现象。
    通知规定清理范围包括：党、政统计报表、造成统计负担的调查提纲、各种形式的统计资料等，不论曾否经过批准手续，一律进行彻底清理。要求省级各部门报表比上年精简50％到60％的统计工作量；各市县所发报表要求比上年精简70％。
    为使全省清理、简化统计报表工作进行得深入彻底，通知中责成省统计局负责全面组织领导这一工作。
    此外，通知中还对今后表格的审批办法、统计资料的供应及保证统计数字的统一等问题作了规定。预计这项工作在3月下旬全部完成。
