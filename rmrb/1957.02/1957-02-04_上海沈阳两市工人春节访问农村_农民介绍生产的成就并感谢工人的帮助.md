Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 2nd: A convoy of vehicles led by a Jiefang (Liberation) brand truck carried nearly a hundred worker representatives from Shanghai to the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative First Branch in the western suburbs of Shanghai this morning to pay a New Year's visit.

At this model vegetable production cooperative, the worker representatives met another group of visitors - officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army led by a major.

The PLA officers and soldiers and the workers sat together in the cooperative's clubhouse, adorned with honor rolls, medals, and banners, and listened to the introduction given by Gu Busheng, the director of the branch. He said that last year, the members overcame the severe cold in spring, the high temperature of 108 degrees in summer, and the heavy rain and typhoons in autumn, and still produced more than 10,000 catties of vegetables per mu on average, supplying vegetables to the people of Shanghai throughout the year.

While accompanying the guests to visit the various production teams, the members introduced that the electric irrigation network and artificial rain equipment were manufactured by Shanghai workers; the Hongxing Avenue for transporting vegetables and the wired broadcasting were built with the help of the PLA comrades; without the support of the workers and the PLA, the cooperative could not have achieved such results, which enabled 96% of the members to increase their income compared to before joining the advanced cooperative.

The PLA representatives and the worker representatives saw the newly cultivated fresh mushrooms in several heated darkrooms, some of which were as big as teacups. The members said that this was a new variety of vegetables they had added this year. This year, they will especially increase the new varieties of vegetables during the off-season, so as to better serve the city.

The amateur artists among the worker representatives enthusiastically performed for the members. Both hosts and guests encouraged each other with the words "Build the country with diligence and thrift, run the cooperative with diligence and thrift, manage the family with diligence and thrift."

Today, a total of more than two thousand worker representatives from Shanghai were divided into thirty-eight teams to visit farmers in the suburbs.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 2nd: On the 1st, workers from nearly a hundred factories in Shenyang visited various rural areas near Shenyang.

In the morning, the factory workers, carrying cultural and recreational supplies and gifts (New Year pictures, calendars), drove in large trucks from all directions to various agricultural cooperatives.

When the workers of the Shenyang Electrical and Mechanical Factory arrived at the Dapan Cooperative, seventy li away, groups of farmers were already waiting in front of the village. The sound of firecrackers rang in the air, and the stilt walkers danced for them amidst laughter.

The workers were divided into groups to visit the homes of cooperative members, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, demobilized soldiers, and "five-guarantee" households. The door of the newly built house of cooperative member Wang Zhanshan was decorated with bright and eye-catching Spring Festival couplets. Wang Zhanshan's wife talked to the workers about the first autumn harvest after collectivization. She said that her family had received more than 500 yuan, and they had no worries about food and clothing. They bought more than 40 catties of meat for the Spring Festival. The large and small bags hanging in the house were all sorghum, corn, rice, and white flour that had been distributed. Her house also had a pair of earphones for a crystal radio, a newly dug well in the yard, and a fat pig being raised. The director of the cooperative introduced that they were the poorest family in the village before liberation. The workers went into the home of martyr's family member Feng Huangshi, who enthusiastically said that she was both a martyr's family member and a "five-guarantee" household, and she had no worries about food, clothing, or fuel. Old Lady Feng received more than 500 catties of grain, four carts of firewood, and the cooperative also distributed 20 catties of soybeans to her to make her favorite "dajiang" (soybean paste). She also spent more than 14 yuan to buy a new piece of clothing.

In the village elementary school, the art troupe brought by the workers of the Shenyang Electrical and Mechanical Factory performed magic for the farmers. Then, a members' meeting was held here, announcing this year's guidance contract between the factory and the rural village. The contract includes three aspects: political education, production technology, and culture and health. This year, the factory will help them install water pumping equipment, guide the maintenance of agricultural machinery, improve the accounting system, train health workers, and carry out voluntary labor during the busy farming season. Both sides will also send representatives to report on the achievements in industrial and agricultural production, encourage each other, and complete the production plan. The Dapan Cooperative had a bumper harvest after collectivization. As a result of reclaiming wasteland and opening up paddy fields, the output of rice alone exceeded the planned output by three times. 98% of the cooperative's five hundred households increased their income. The average income per laborer was more than 500 yuan. After the autumn harvest, the entire cooperative delivered a total of 100,000 catties of public grain and sold 500,000 catties of surplus grain. Dapan Cooperative's bumper harvest is inseparable from the help of this factory. Last year, the workers of this factory carried out voluntary labor to jointly build the "Worker-Peasant Reservoir" with the farmers, donated four water pumps, and helped them install rice milling machines and flour milling machines.

    上海沈阳两市工人春节访问农村
    农民介绍生产的成就并感谢工人的帮助
    新华社上海2日电　一队由解放牌汽车为前导的汽车行列，今天早晨载着近百名上海的工人代表，冒雨前往上海西郊虹星农业生产合作社第一分社作新春访问。
    工人代表们在这个模范蔬菜生产合作社里，遇见了来访的另一批客人——由一位少校率领的中国人民解放军官兵们。
    解放军官兵和工人们一起坐在挂满光荣榜、奖章和锦旗的合作社俱乐部里听了分社主任顾步生的介绍。他说去年一年，社员们战胜了春季的严寒，夏季一百零八度的高温，秋季的暴雨和台风，平均每亩地仍生产蔬菜一万斤以上，一年四季都有蔬菜供应上海的人民。
    在伴同客人们参观各个生产队的时候，社员们介绍说：这些电力灌溉网和人工下雨设备，是上海工人制造的；运输蔬菜的虹星大道以及有线广播，是解放军的同志帮助修建的；没有工人和解放军的支援，社里不可能取得这样的成绩，这就使得96％的社员都比参加高级社以前增加了收入。
    解放军的代表和工人代表在几间备有暖气的暗房里看到了社里新培植的鲜蘑菇，有的长得有茶杯口那样大。社员们说，这是他们今年新增加的蔬菜品种。今年他们将特别增加蔬菜淡季的新品种，更好地为城市服务。
    工人代表中的业余艺术家们热情地为社员们作了演出。主客双方都用“勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭治家”的话相互勉励。
    今天，上海一共有二千多工人代表分成三十八队分别访问了郊区农民。
    新华社沈阳2日电　沈阳近百个工厂的职工们在1日分别访问了沈阳附近各农村。
    早上，各工厂职工带着文娱用品和礼品（年画、日历），乘着大卡车，从四面八方驶向各农业合作社。
    当沈阳电工机械厂职工到达七十里外的大潘社时，成群的农民已在村前等候，空中响起了鞭炮声，高跷队在欢笑声中为他们舞蹈着。
    职工分组到社员、烈属、军属、复员军人和五保户家中进行访问。社员王占山新盖的房子门前贴有鲜艳夺目的春联。王占山的妻子向职工们谈合作化后的第一个秋收。她说，她家分得了五百多元钱，吃穿都不愁，过春节买了四十多斤肉。屋里挂着的大袋小袋，都是分来的高粱、玉米、大米、白面。她家的屋里还挂着一付矿石收音机的耳机，院子里有一只新打的井，并且喂有一口肥猪。社主任介绍说，他们就是解放前村内最贫困的人家。职工们走进烈属冯黄氏家里，她热情地说她是烈属又是五保户，吃、穿、烧都不愁了。冯老太太分得了五百多斤粮食，四车柴火，社里还分给她二十斤大豆，让她作爱吃的“大酱”。她还用十四元多钱买了一件新衣裳。
    在村小学校里，沈阳电工机械厂职工们带来的文工队给农民们表演了魔术。接着又在这里召开了社员大会，宣布了这个工厂和这个农村今年的辅导合同。合同包括政治教育、生产技术、文化卫生三个方面。今年工厂要帮助他们再安装抽水设备，指导检修农业机械、改进会计制度、训练卫生员；并在农忙时进行义务劳动等，双方还要派代表报告工农业生产上的成就，互相鼓励，完成生产计划。大潘社合作化后曾获得大丰收，由于开荒地、辟水田的结果，仅水稻就超过计划产量的三倍。全社五百多户社员，98％都增加了收入。平均每个劳动力收入五百多元。全社秋收后，共交公粮十万斤，卖余粮五十万斤。大潘社丰收和这个工厂的帮助是分不开的。这个工厂职工去年曾进行义务劳动同农民们合修了“工农水库”，赠送了四台水泵并且帮他们安装了磨米机和磨面机。
