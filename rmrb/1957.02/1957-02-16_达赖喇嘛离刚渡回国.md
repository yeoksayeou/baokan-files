Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 15th: The Dalai Lama and his entourage left Sikkim in the Himalayas on the morning of the 14th to return home. They had been visiting Sikkim for two weeks.

    Before leaving Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, the Dalai Lama reviewed a joint guard of honor composed of Sikkim police and Indian troops on the square in front of the palace. The Maharaja of Sikkim, with his palms together and holding incense, led the way for the Dalai Lama. He bid farewell to the guests at the end of the road.

    A long line of lamas in red robes, principal officials, and people lined the road to see the Dalai Lama off. The air above every village along the road was filled with the smoke of incense.

    The Dalai Lama and his entourage, accompanied by the Prince of Sikkim and the Prime Minister of Sikkim, traveled by car to a place about ten miles up the mountain, from where they switched to mules.

    More than a hundred mules carried the guests along the winding, narrow mountain road. The Dalai Lama, wearing a yellow silk robe and a leather hat, walked at the head of the long line. Mr. Pant, an Indian government official stationed in Sikkim, and Mr. Ye Chengzhang, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in India, accompanied the Dalai Lama to Nathu La Pass on the Sikkim border. The Dalai Lama will cross this place, 14,000 feet above sea level, to return to Tibet.

    达赖喇嘛离刚渡回国
    新华社新德里15日电　达赖喇嘛及其随行人员14日早上从喜马拉雅山中的锡金启程回国。他们在锡金进行了两周的访问。
    在离开锡金首都刚渡以前，达赖在王宫前的广场上检阅了由锡金警察和印度军队组成的联合仪仗队。锡金大君双手合十，拿着香为达赖引路。他在路的尽头向客人们告别。
    一长列穿着红袍的喇嘛、主要的官员和人民排在路旁为达赖送行。在路旁每一村庄的上空都是香烟缭绕。
    达赖和他的随行人员由锡金王子和锡金首相陪同乘汽车到达山上约十英里的地方，从那里开始，他们改骑骡子。
    一百多匹骡子载着客人们在曲折狭隘的山路上行进。达赖穿着黄缎子的长袍，戴着皮帽子，走在这个长长的行列的最前面。印度驻锡金政府官员潘特和中国驻印度大使馆参赞叶成章陪同达赖喇嘛前往锡金边境的纳都拉关。达赖将越过这个拔海一万四千英尺的地方回西藏。
