Spring Festival Brings Good News
	Yan Shugui

	It's Spring Festival time again. Are the many people who have left their hometowns to come to the interior of the motherland enjoying the festival as happily as their families? How are they working and living this year on the Gobi Desert, on the year-round snow-capped Qilian Mountains, and on the boundless grasslands? "Every festival makes one think of one's relatives," who can not miss their distant relatives during this joyous festival?

	Let me report on their situation: the six or seven thousand young people from other places who are fighting on various fronts in Gansu Province are now celebrating the Spring Festival with everyone else. Although their New Year's Eve was spent on the construction sites of large enterprises such as the Lanzhou Refinery and the Thermal Power Plant, and the parties were held on the Gobi Desert and barren hills, and the living conditions were somewhat poor, they still ate a hearty "New Year's meal" and participated in dances and watched Peking Opera, Yue Opera, and Henan Opera that they themselves had rehearsed with great interest.

	However, these are not what we want to emphasize to our relatives. During this festival, the young people feel that what is worth telling their relatives is that they are bravely facing the difficulties in their work in Gansu Province and contributing a part of their strength to the socialist construction of the great motherland. What they feel is worth telling their relatives is that they have trained and improved themselves in labor and become skilled builders on various fronts. Many people have won the glorious title of advanced producer, and many have been accepted as glorious members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

	Of course, many young people have come to Gansu from prosperous cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and there are many unsatisfactory aspects of their lives. There is a tortuous process between not being used to it and burying oneself in work. Achievements in work often belong to those young people who dare to overcome difficulties and are brave enough to train themselves. Shanghai youth Ma Jegang was only eighteen years old when he came to Lanzhou last year, and he still had a childish face. When he first arrived in Lanzhou, he felt that there were many things he was not used to: many of the mountains were bare, without trees; and the roads were so bumpy and dusty. But when he was assigned to work at Qing'an Road Primary School in Lanzhou, the children's innocent faces and eagerness to learn immediately aroused his sense of responsibility: these children need their own work! This place needs its own work! He humbly asked his colleagues for advice, prepared his lessons carefully, and tried his best to make the lessons more vivid in the classroom so that the children could easily understand them. In his spare time, he played with the children and visited their families. As a result, he received unanimous praise from teachers and students and was elected as a people's representative in Lanzhou.

	Some young comrades, due to a lack of work experience, often cry when they first encounter difficulties and want to return to their mothers' side. After a period of work, the bravery of the younger generation is displayed in them, and they strive to become good sons and daughters of the Party. Yang Biyu, a young girl who grew up in Meixian County, Guangdong Province, was assigned to work as a medical worker in the Gannan Yugur Autonomous County. She could not understand the language. She repeated a sentence to the patient three times, but she still could not understand it. Wang Ailian, a minority woman, had lost four children at birth, and several treatments had not been effective. She said with great dissatisfaction: "You check today and diagnose tomorrow, what exactly have you treated?" When Yang Biyu heard this criticism, she thought of her warm family and her loving mother, and could not help but shed tears. But then she thought: can the young people cultivated by the Communist Party be so fragile in the face of difficulties? Absolutely not. From then on, she faced life boldly, riding her horse every day, carrying her medicine bag, running around Baiyange River, Fula Hai, and Ganggou Village, carefully treating the herdsmen, and patiently explaining to them. In her spare time, she helped them with some work and chatted with them, and her relationship with the masses quickly improved. For more than a year, Yang Biyu has been working on the grassland with full confidence, as if living in her own hometown.

	On the vast virgin land of the Hexi Corridor, on the barren plains of the Yellow River in northern Gansu Province, hundreds and thousands of young immigrants are using their own diligent hands to cut through thorns and build happy homes, increasing grain and cotton production for the country. They are scattering their sweat and seeds together on the newly cultivated fertile land. Many people have been praised and loved by the masses in agricultural production. Sun Qiuyue, a girl from Henan, is one of them. In March last year, when the dry wasteland was in urgent need of irrigation and sowing, the snow water from the Qilian Mountains did not flow down for two days, and everyone was very anxious. One night, Sun Qiuyue was so anxious that she could not sleep, and quietly got out of bed and ran to the barren mountains to see if the water had come down. She ran up along the canal, and suddenly heard the sound of snow water flowing down in the wind. Sun Qiuyue turned her head and ran, shouting, "Comrades, get up! The water's coming! The water's coming!" As she shouted, the water had already flowed to her. The water was too large and the canal could not hold it, so it broke through the canal and flowed outwards. We can't let the water flow away for nothing! Before the comrades came, she hurriedly took off her cotton jacket, filled it with some soil, and plugged the gap to stop the water. One cotton jacket was not enough, so she took off her cotton pants. The cotton jacket and cotton pants still could not stop it, so she took off six clothes in a row, filled them with soil, and finally plugged the gap around her. When everyone saw her taking off her clothes to stop the water, they all took off their own clothes as well, and finally stopped the water. It was precisely because of the efforts of countless young people like Sun Qiuyue that many immigrant agricultural cooperatives achieved a bumper harvest, built houses, and the members of the cooperatives all put on new clothes and spent a prosperous Spring Festival on the newly reclaimed land.

	Of course, field work is even harder. But what does this hardship mean to our young people? The 679 team, which is active in the Qilian Mountains, has more than 160 young people, more than 90% of whom are from other places. Some speak with a Hebei and Cantonese accent, and some speak with a Zhejiang and Shaanxi accent. They come from different corners, but for a common purpose - to find mineral deposits for the motherland. When passing the Changma River and Shule River, they stood in the cold and biting river water and dragged the cars out of the river. In Eagle Mouth Mountain, Tiger Cave Mouth, Hongshi Daban, Jiaoyin River, Daxiaogongcha and other places, they climbed over snow-capped mountains and cliffs. Many of them have had snow blindness, making them unable to see anything for a while. On high mountains of three or four thousand meters above sea level, the air is thin and the air pressure is too low, and many people have headaches and shortness of breath. Some comrades lost their way in the dark in order to do more work, and persevered in hunger and cold for three consecutive days before returning to the team headquarters. When the grain could not be supplied as planned, they insisted on working by eating one steamed bun and some vermicelli a day. What ideas are supporting them? Qin Zuyi, a member of the Communist Youth League, answered well: "I think the most important thing is the Party's education of our young people, which makes us clearly realize that to be a real person, we must be good at fighting against difficulties." Many young people are fighting in the barren mountains and wild mountains with this heroic spirit, finding iron, coal, copper, zinc, lead and other mineral deposits for the motherland.

	Relatives far away from Gansu, if you miss your children during the Spring Festival, you should think more about their labor achievements in the Northwest construction and believe that they are growing rapidly under the education of the Party. When they left their hometowns, they may have shed tears of farewell, but today, they have become brave and conscious fighters.

    春节报佳音	燕树桂
    现在正是春节。许多远离家乡来到祖国内地的人们，是不是和家人一样愉快地欢度春节呢？这一年，他们在平沙万里的戈壁滩上，在终年积雪的祁连山上，在一望无际的大草原上，工作得怎样？生活得怎样？“每逢佳节倍思亲”，在这个欢乐的节日里，谁能不惦念远方的亲人呢？
    让我来汇报一下他们的情况吧：战斗在甘肃省各个战线上的六七万外地青年，现在也同大家一样在欢度春节。虽然，他们的除夕是在兰州炼油厂、热电站等大型企业工地上过的，晚会是在戈壁滩、荒山野地上进行的，生活条件差一些；但是他们照样吃着丰盛的“年饭”，带着很大的兴趣参加舞会和观看自己排演的京剧、越剧和河南梆子。
    但是，这些不是我们所要着重告诉亲人的。青年们在这个节日里，认为值得告诉亲人的，是他们在甘肃省这个地方勇敢地迎接着工作中的困难，在伟大祖国的社会主义建设中贡献出自己一部分力量。他们感到值得向亲人告诉的，是在劳动中锻炼了自己，提高了自己，成为各个战线上熟练的建设者。不少人获得了先进生产者的光荣称号，不少人被接收为光荣的共产党员和青年团员。
    当然，许多青年从繁华的上海、天津、广州等城市来到甘肃，生活上有许多不如意的地方。从不习惯到埋头工作，中间都经过一段曲折的过程。工作中取得成就常常属于那些敢于克服困难勇于锻炼自己的青年。上海青年马捷岗，在去年来兰州时不过十八岁，还是一脸孩子气。他初到兰州的时候，感觉到有许多不习惯的地方：很多山头都是光秃秃的，没有树；马路又是这样坎坷不平，尘土飞扬。但是当他被分配到兰州市庆安路小学工作，孩子们的稚气的面孔和急于求知的欲望，马上激起他的责任感：这些孩子需要自己工作！这个地方需要自己工作！他虚心地向同事们请教，认真地准备功课，在课堂上又极力把课文讲得生动一些，叫孩子们容易听懂。在课余，和孩子们在一起玩，访问小朋友的家庭。结果，他在教师和学生当中获得一致的好评，并且被选举为兰州市的人民代表。
    有些青年同志，由于工作经验缺乏，初遇到困难，往往要哭鼻子，想回到妈妈身边。经过一段工作之后，青年一代的勇敢就在他们身上显示出来了，他们努力要求自己成为党的好儿女。杨碧玉，这个生长在广东省梅县的小姑娘，分派到甘南裕固族自治县作医务工作，言语不通，三番两次地向患者重复一句话，还是听不懂，少数民族妇女王爱莲，连生四个孩子都死掉了，几次治疗也没见效果。她很不满意地说：“你们今天检查，明天诊断，到底治疗了个啥？”杨碧玉听了这番责备，想起自己温暖的家庭和慈爱的母亲，不禁要掉下泪来。但是，她又想：共产党所培养的青年能在困难面前表现这样脆弱吗？万万不能。从此，她大胆地面对生活，每天骑着马，背着药包，奔驰在白杨格河、福拉海、甘沟村一带，细心地给牧民进行治疗，耐心地进行解释。工余时间又帮助他们做些活，拉拉家常，群众关系很快得到改善。一年多来，杨碧玉像生活在自己的家乡一样，满怀信心地在草原上工作着。
    在河西走廊辽阔的处女地上，在甘肃省北部黄河平原的荒原上，成千成百的青年移民用自己勤劳的双手，披荆斩棘，建设幸福的家园，为国家增产粮棉。他们把自己的汗珠和种籽一起，撒到新开垦的肥沃的土地上。许多人在农业生产中受到群众的赞扬和爱戴。河南姑娘孙秋月便是他们当中的一位。去年3月间，当干枯的荒地急需灌水、播种的时候，祁连山的雪水有两天没有流下来了，大伙都非常着急。一天夜里，孙秋月急得睡不着，悄悄地从床上爬了起来，跑到荒山上去看水下来了没有。她沿着渠道往上跑，忽然从风声里听见雪水哗哗地流了下来。孙秋月扭过头来，一边跑，一边喊：“同志们，快起来呀，水来了！水来了！”喊着，喊着，水已经流到她跟前了。水太大，渠里容不下，冲开渠道往外流开。不能让水白白地流掉呀！她不等同志们来，就急忙把自己身上的棉衣脱下来，装些土，塞在缺口上堵水。一件棉衣不中用，又脱下了棉裤。棉衣棉裤还是塞不住，一连脱了六件衣裳，装上了土，才把她周围的缺口堵住了。大家一看她脱了衣裳来堵水，也都纷纷脱下了自己的衣裳，最后终于把水口堵住了。正是由于无数像孙秋月这样的青年的努力，许多移民组成的农业社获得了丰收，修建了房屋，社员们都换上了新的衣衫，在新垦的土地上过着一个富裕的春节。
    野外工作当然要更苦一些。但是这种苦对于我们的青年又算得了什么呢？活跃在祁连山上的六七九队，有一百六十多个青年，其中90％以上是外地来的。有的说着一口的河北话和广东话，有的说着一口的浙江话和陕西话。他们来自不同的角落，却为着一个共同的目的——为祖国寻找矿藏。在路过昌马河、疏勒河时，他们站在寒冷刺骨的河水里，从河里把汽车拖上来。在鹰嘴山、虎洞口、红石大坂、焦银河、大小公岔等地方，他们爬过雪山，攀过悬崖。他们当中不少人得过雪盲病，弄得一时什么也看不见。在拔海三四千公尺的高山上，空气稀薄，气压过低，不少人头痛气喘。有的同志为了多做一些工作，黑夜里迷失方向，一连忍饥挨饿三天，才返回队部。在粮食不能按计划供应到的时候，他们每人每天靠吃一个馍馍和一些粉条坚持工作。什么思想在支持他们呢？青年团员秦祖翼回答得好：“我以为最重要的是党对我们青年的教育，使我们明确认识到要做一个真正的人，必须善于向困难作斗争。”许多青年正是用这种英雄气概战斗在荒山野岭，为祖国找到铁、煤、铜、锌、铅等矿藏。
    远离甘肃的亲人们，如果你们在春节期间惦念起自己的子女，应该多想一想他们在西北建设中的劳动成果，相信他们在党的教育下正在迅速地成长起来。在离开家乡的时候，他们也许流过惜别的眼泪，而今天，他们已经变成勇敢的自觉的战士了。
