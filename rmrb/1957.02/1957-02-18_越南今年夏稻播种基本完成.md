Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th: Vietnam's North has basically completed over 80% of its planned planting of more than 900,000 hectares of summer rice this year. Significant progress has been made in the fight against drought in arid areas.

The Fourth Interzone, which has the most planting, has reached 95% of its planted area, the Viet Bac Autonomous Region reached 85%, and the Hong Quang Special Zone reached 87%. The Third Interzone and the Left Bank region, which were more severely affected by drought, have also reached over 80% of their planted areas.

Last winter, there was little rainfall in northern Vietnam, and some areas experienced drought. Responding to the government's call to fight the drought, farmers launched a major production competition, actively digging ditches, wells, and storing water, so that many dry fields could be irrigated. Local garrisons also actively assisted the people in fighting the drought.

The more than 300 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects repaired last year and the large and medium-sized water conservancy irrigation systems basically completed in January this year will increase the irrigated area for summer rice this year by more than 61,000 hectares, which will greatly contribute to the planting of summer rice.

    越南今年夏稻播种基本完成
    新华社河内17日电　越南北方今年计划播种的九十多万公顷的夏稻，目前已经完成了80％以上。干旱地区的抗旱斗争取得很大成绩。
    播种最多的第四联区已经达到种植面积的95％，越北自治区达85％，鸿广特区达87％。受旱灾较严重的第三联区和左岸区也达到了播种面积的80％以上。
    去年冬天，越南北方雨量稀少，有些地区发生了旱情。农民们响应政府抗旱的号召，发动了生产大竞赛，积极挖水沟，开井和蓄水，使许多干旱的田地都有水灌溉。各地驻军也积极协助人民抗旱。
    在去年修复的三百多个大中型的水利工程和今年1月份基本完工的大中型水利灌溉系统，将使今年夏稻的灌溉面积比去年增加六万一千多公顷，这样对夏稻的种植起很大作用。
