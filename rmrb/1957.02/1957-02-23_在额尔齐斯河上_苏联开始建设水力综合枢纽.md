Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd -- According to TASS: The Soviet Union is building a series of hydraulic complexes on the Irtysh River, the largest tributary of the Ob River in Siberia, to comprehensively utilize the river's water resources to serve the booming industrial construction and agricultural production of Kazakhstan and Western Siberia.

The Irtysh River, originating in China, is more than 4,420 kilometers long. It flows through the Republic of Kazakhstan, Western Siberia, and joins the Ob River at Khanty-Mansiysk in Siberia. The section from Lake Zaysan in eastern Kazakhstan to Omsk in Siberia is particularly suitable for the construction of hydraulic complexes. The Leningrad Branch of the Soviet State Hydro-Design Institute has recently formulated a plan for the comprehensive utilization of the water resources of this section, deciding to build thirteen hydroelectric power stations on this 1,700-kilometer stretch of river. Among them, the Shimanovsk Hydroelectric Station in the Republic of Kazakhstan, with a generating capacity of over 300,000 kilowatts, is already generating electricity, and the Bukhtarma Hydroelectric Station will generate electricity next year. Construction of the largest Shulbinsk Hydroelectric Station will begin soon, and preparations are being accelerated. After the completion of these thirteen hydroelectric power stations, they will generate a total of 12 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually.

The Irtysh River, from Lake Zaysan to Omsk, flows through the main reclamation areas of Kazakhstan and the resource-rich East Kazakhstan, Semipalatinsk, and Pavlodar regions, as well as the southern part of the Omsk region. The development of water resources in this section of the river will meet the growing demand for electricity from these new industrial and agricultural production bases. In addition, the hydraulic complexes built on this river will also irrigate 4 million hectares of arid land in the above-mentioned areas and solve the water supply problem for several of Kazakhstan's largest industrial centers, such as Karaganda, Dzhezkazgan, and Atasu. The reservoirs of more than ten power stations will become the best artificial fish farms and will transform the Irtysh River from the Chinese border to the Siberian Railway into a deep-water navigable channel, fundamentally improving the river's water transport.

    在额尔齐斯河上
    苏联开始建设水力综合枢纽
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联正在西伯利亚鄂毕河的最大支流额尔齐斯河上建设一系列水力综合枢纽，以全面利用这条大河的水力资源为哈萨克和西部西伯利亚的正在蓬勃发展的工业建设和农业生产服务。
    发源于中国的额尔齐斯河全长四千四百二十多公里。它流经哈萨克共和国、西部西伯利亚，而在西伯利亚的汉特—马西斯克同鄂毕河会合。其中，从哈萨克东部的斋桑泊到西伯利亚的鄂木斯克这一段特别适于进行水力综合枢纽工程建设。苏联国家水利设计研究所列宁格勒分所最近制定出全面利用这一段的水力资源的计划，决定在长达一千七百多公里的这一段河上建设十三个水力发电站。其中位于哈萨克共和国境内发电能力为三十多万瓩的石山口水电站已经发电，布赫塔马水电站将在明年发电。最大的舒尔宾卡水电站不久就将开始建设，建设的准备工作已经在加紧进行。这十三个水电站建成后，每年总共将生产一百二十亿度电力。
    额尔齐斯河从斋桑泊到鄂木斯克这一段流经哈萨克的主要开垦区和蕴藏着丰富的矿藏资源的东哈萨克斯坦、塞米巴拉丁斯克和巴夫洛达州以及鄂木斯克州的南部。对这一段河流的水力资源的开发，将满足这些新工农业生产基地对电力日益增长的需要。此外，在这条河上建设的水力综合枢纽还将灌溉上述地区四百万公顷干旱的土地，并且为哈萨克几个最大的工业中心如卡拉干达、杰什卡什干、阿塔苏等地解决供水问题。十多个发电站的水库将成为最好的人工养鱼场，并且将把额尔齐斯河从中国边境到西伯利亚大铁道这一段变成一条深水航道，从根本上改进这条大河的水运工作。
