Responses to Criticism

    A letter from the Xingyang County Grain Bureau: The article "It's Time to Reduce Statistical Reports," published on page 4 of the People's Daily on October 25, 1956, criticized us. Our bureau immediately conducted a comprehensive review and, during the autumn grain purchase and marketing, eliminated all dispensable columns from the tables. As a result, the autumn survey tables had 71 fewer items than the summer ones. This demonstrates that there was a relatively serious problem of subjectivism and bureaucratic style in our past work.

    对批评的反应
    荥阳县粮食局来信：1956年10月25日人民日报第四版发表的“是减少统计表报的时候了”一文，对我们提出了批评，我局当即进行了全面检查，并在秋季统购统销中将表中可有可无的栏都减去了，结果秋季的调查表比夏季的栏目减少了七十一项。这样就说明我们过去工作中存在着比较严重的主观主义和文牍主义作风。
