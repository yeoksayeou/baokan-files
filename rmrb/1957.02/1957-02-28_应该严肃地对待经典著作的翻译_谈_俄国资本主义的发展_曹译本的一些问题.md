    Classic Works of Translation Should Be Treated Seriously
    --On Some Problems with Cao's Translation of "The Development of Capitalism in Russia"
    Zhou Xi
    Lenin's book "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" has had two translations, one by Jiao Minzhi and the other by Cao Baohua, with Cao's translation being the most popular. Recently, the Workers' Publishing House compiled an abstract of the book, included in "Lenin on Labor."
    I have not read Jiao Minzhi's translation. Last year, when studying political economics, I read Cao Baohua's translation. In order to assist my studies, I only selected and read a portion of it. However, because my knowledge base was too poor, I couldn't understand many parts and could only comprehend them according to my own level. I marked the unclear sections in the book and kept them in mind. I heard that the Workers' Publishing House had newly translated an abstract of this classic work, so I bought it to read it again. I found that the translation was not only more fluent than Cao's, but also had many obvious differences. This piqued my interest, so I further compared the two books and found that Cao Baohua's translation had many parts that were clearly wrong. --A person unfamiliar with Russian should not make such rash judgments, but because these errors are very obvious and some fall within the realm of common sense, I dare to say so. At the same time, because many people are studying political economics recently, and most of them will read this classic work, I would like to raise this issue from the reader's point of view, in order to attract the attention of readers and the correction of translators, so that this classic work can be further improved.
    The Cao translation I read was published by People's Publishing House in 1954 (third edition, fourth printing). After comparing the first, third, and part of the sixth chapters with the translation published by the Workers' Publishing House, I found many differences between the two books. These differences, in my opinion, are due to Cao Baohua's mistranslation or translation that is not accurate enough. Here are just a few obvious examples.
    First, in the section "The Significance of Machinery in Agriculture," after Lenin described the results of using machinery in agriculture, he said that in the already formed capitalist agriculture, a certain worker hierarchy was created, and using South Russian farms as an example, he divided them into the following grades: (A) Full labor force - adult males capable of doing all the work; (B) Half labor force, i.e., women and men under the age of twenty. Half labor force is further divided into two types: (1) From twelve-thirteen years old to fifteen-sixteen years old -- half labor force in the narrow sense; (2) Strong half labor force... From sixteen-twenty years old, capable of doing all the work of a full labor force except for harvesting grain (the above is based on the translation of the Workers' Publishing House). Lenin's classification of these grades is completely understandable. However, I suffered a bit when I read Cao's translation in the past. Cao's translation translates these grades as: "Complete workers," "Half workers" (these two terms, if carefully considered, can still be understood.) Under the "Half workers" are further divided into so-called "Half workers in the narrow sense" and "Strong Half workers," "Weak Half workers." Who can understand such terms?
    Second, the word "craft" often appears in Cao's translation, such as: "Hired labor is precisely the 'craft' specializing in middle peasants" (page 197), "Farmers going out to do 'craft'" (page 204), "Agricultural craft," "Craftsman" (page 207), "Combination of agriculture and craft" (page 210), etc. When reading Cao's translation, I once guessed the meaning of these two words, but could not understand them. This time, after reading the new translation, I suddenly understood. It turns out that the so-called "specialized craft" in Cao's translation is "specialized sideline," "farmers going out to do craft" is "farmers going out to do odd jobs," "agricultural craft" is "agricultural sideline," "craftsman" is "sideline worker," and "combination of agriculture and craft" is "combination of agriculture and handicraft."
    In addition, there are many other places where the translation of names is wrong, such as: translating "labor force" as "labor manpower," "serfdom" as "serf law," "lower-class peasant households" as "low-class farmers," "farmers" as "native farmers," "fitters" as "locksmiths," "vise" as "press," agricultural workers' "industrial accidents" as "serious injuries," "outside world" as "remaining world," "skilled masters caused by division of labor" as "division of labor masters." Even the "price" is mistranslated as "value" (see note 1 on page 197). I don't think this is due to the translator's lack of common sense in political economics, but obviously due to carelessness and irresponsibility. Such an attitude towards classic works is highly inappropriate; even minor errors should be avoided as much as possible.
    Lenin had unparalleled knowledge, and in his works, he often talked about the situation of many specialized industries in a very professional manner, convincingly agreeing with his arguments. Our translators, due to their lack of knowledge, will naturally encounter many difficulties when translating; but if they don't understand, they should try to consult others and avoid making wild guesses, otherwise they will make big mistakes. For example, there is a passage in Cao's translation on page 213 that reads: "Working in front of the machine causes occupational division and occupational diseases. For example, those who work under the thresher have drummers (they put the straw into the drum; this is the most dangerous and difficult work; dense plant dust flies out of the drum and hits people's faces)." I couldn't understand this passage at all. I couldn't imagine why the "drummer" would work under the thresher? Why would there be "drummers" under the thresher? It was not until I read the new translation of the Workers' Publishing House that I understood that it should be: "Working on machines causes occupational division and occupational diseases. For example, those who work under the thresher have 'threshers' (they put the bundles of grain into the threshing drum; this is a very dangerous and extremely difficult task, because a large amount of plant powder flies from the threshing drum and hits people's faces." In addition, translating the specialized agricultural term "fleshy taproot crops" as "tubers" and the textile term "bobbin boy" as "reelers" are all mistakes that occur because they are unwilling to consult others.
    Furthermore, how can readers understand the meaning of these words: "'No factories can be established in any village,' - we read about the silk weaving industry, - 'factories should follow the weavers to those villages, where a full staff familiar with the business has already been formed due to going out (or, let's add, by relying on family work).'" (See page 388 of Cao's translation) What does it mean that "no factories can be established in any village"? How can factories "follow the weavers to the villages"? After reading the following translation, I suddenly understood. "Regarding the silk weaving industry, we read the following sentence: 'Factories cannot be established arbitrarily in any village, and any number of factories cannot be established arbitrarily. Factories must be established in those villages where there are silk weavers, where a staff familiar with the business has been formed through foreign workers (or, to add a sentence, through family labor).'"
    In addition, there are still many places in Cao's translation where the Chinese is illogical and obscure, and I will give an example here. In note 1 on page 206, there is this sentence: "The number of rural workers who go out to 'make a living' and at least partially take the train is about one-tenth of the total workers..." Here, "at least partially take the train" actually means "took the train for a section." Other things such as "the use of machines... is also characterized by extremely large economic scale," "girls and children aged 12-17" (doesn't "children" include girls? it should be "boys and girls"), "landlessness is progressing rapidly," "during the harvest season of a bumper harvest" (both "bumper harvest" and "harvest"), etc. are even more common.
    It should be pointed out that this is a classic work, the translation was published by the People's Publishing House, and it has already been published in three editions; the translator is generally considered to be one of the good translators, and according to the translator's postscript, in addition to checking against the new version of the Soviet National Political Book Publishing Bureau, and comparing it with the English and Japanese versions, it is inappropriate to still have these obvious errors. The translator and publisher should pay attention to this issue, and I hope that they can seriously revise it again, so that this classic work can have a more perfect translation and meet with the broad masses of readers, so that it can better help readers and be worthy of this great work.

    应该严肃地对待经典著作的翻译
    ——谈“俄国资本主义的发展”曹译本的一些问题
    周熙
    列宁著的“俄国资本主义的发展”一书，曾经有过焦敏之和曹葆华的两种译本，而以曹译本最为流行；最近工人出版社又编译了该书的摘要，收在“列宁论劳动”一书中。
    焦敏之的译本，我没有读过；去年学习政治经济学的时候，曾经读过曹葆华的译本。为了配合学习，只选读了其中的一部分，但因为自己的知识基础太差，有许多地方读不懂，只能根据自己的水平去理解。不明白的地方，在书上打了些记号，也始终挂在心里。听说工人出版社新译了这本经典著作的摘要，所以买来重新读了一遍，觉得译文除比曹译本流畅之外，还有许多明显的不同。这引起了我的兴趣，于是又进一步将两本书来对照了一下，发现曹葆华的译文有许多地方显然是错误的。——一个不谙俄文的人，本来不应这样轻率地下断语，但由于这些错误十分明显，而且有些属于常识范围以内，所以我才敢于这样说。同时，因近来学习政治经济学的人很多，而且大多数人要读一读这本经典著作，所以我愿从读者的角度把这个问题提出来，以便引起读者的注意和翻译家的指正，从而使这本经典著作更加完善。
    我读的曹译本是1954年人民出版社出版的（第三版，第四次印刷）。对照了工人出版社出版的译文第一章、第三章和第六章的一部分，就发现两书有许多不同之处，而这些不同之处，在我看来是属于曹葆华的误译或译得不够确切。这里仅举几个明显的例子。
    一、在“机器在农业中的意义”这一节里，列宁在叙述了机器在农业中使用的结果之后，他说，在业已形成的资本主义的农业中，造成了一定的工人等级制，并以南俄农场为例，分为下列几等：（甲）全劳动力——能做一切工作的成年男子；（乙）半劳动力，即妇女和二十岁以下的男子。半劳动力又分两种：（一）从十二——十三岁到十五——十六岁——狭义的半劳动力；（二）强壮的半劳动力……从十六——二十岁，除了割谷以外能做全劳动力的一切工作。最后，（丙）是辅助半劳动力，即八岁以上十四岁以下的儿童，他们的工作是放猪、放牛、割草以及犁地时赶牲口（以上系根据工人出版社的译文）。列宁所分列的这几种等级，看了是完全可以理解的；但我过去读曹译本时，却吃了一些苦。曹译本是译为这样几种等级：“完全工人”，“半工人”（这两个名词，仔细琢磨的话，还是可以理解的。）在“半工人”之下又分做所谓“狭义的半工人”与“大力半工人”，“小力半工人”，又有谁能理解这样的名词呢？
    二、曹译本里经常有所谓“工艺”的字样出现，如：“工役正是中农底专门‘工艺’”（一九七页）、“农民外出工艺”（二○四页）、“农业工艺”、“工艺者”（二○七页）、“农业与工艺结合”（二一○页），等等。读曹译本时，我曾猜测这两个字的涵义，不得其解。这次读了新译本，才恍然大悟。原来曹译本上所谓“专门工艺”是“专门副业”，“农民外出工艺”是“农民外出做零工”，“农业工艺”是“农业副业”，“工艺者”是“副业工人”，“农业与工艺结合”是“农业与手工业结合”。
    此外，译名错误的地方还很多，如：将“劳动力”译为“劳动人手”，“农奴制”译为“农奴法”，“下等户农户”译成“低类农民”，“农场主”译成“土著农人”，“钳工”译成“制锁业”，“老虎钳”译成“压榨机”，农业工人的“伤残事故”译成“重伤症”，“外界”译成“其余世界”，“因分工而造成的技艺名手”译成“分工名手”。甚至将“价格”误译为“价值”（见一九七页注一）。我认为这不是译者缺乏政治经济学的常识，很明显的是粗枝大叶、不负责任所致。对经典著作采取这样的态度，是大不应该的；即使是微小的错误，也应力求避免。
    列宁具有渊博无比的知识，在他的著作中经常很内行地谈到许多专门行业的情况，令人信服地同意他的论断。而我们的译者，由于知识的贫乏，译起来当然会碰到许多困难；但是自己不懂，就应该想办法请教别人，不要随便妄加猜测，否则就会铸成大错。如曹译本二一三页有一段译文是这样的：“在机器面前的工作，造成了职业分工与职业病。例如，在打谷机下工作的有鼓手（他们将谷把放在鼓中；这是最危险和困难的工作；密集的植物灰尘从鼓里飞出来打到人们脸上）。”这段话我百思不得其解，无法想像出那“鼓手”为什么要在打谷机下工作？打谷机下又为什么会有“鼓手”？直到看了工人出版社的新译本我才弄明白，原来应该是这样的：“在机器上工作，造成了职业分工和职业病。例如，在打谷机下工作的有“脱粒工”（他们把禾捆放到脱粒滚筒上；这是很危险和极困难的工作，因为大量的植物粉从脱粒滚筒上飞打到人们脸上”）。此外，如将农业上的专门名词“肉质直根类作物”译为“块根”，纺织上的“纱管工”译为“卷丝者”，都是不肯请教别人而发生的错误。
    再如，读者又怎样能看懂这些话的意思呢：“‘在任何村庄都不能建立任何数目的工厂’，——我们关于丝织业读道，——‘工厂应当跟着织工走到那些村落中去，在那里由于外出（或者，我们且加上一句，凭着家庭工作），熟习业务的充分的人员已经形成了’。”（见曹译本三八八页）“任何村庄都不能建立任何数目的工厂”，究竟是什么意思？工厂又怎样“跟着织工走到村庄中去”？读了下面的译文，才会恍然大悟。“关于丝织业，我们读到如下的字句：“不能随意在哪一个村子里建立工厂，不能随意要建立几个就建立几个，工厂必须在那些有丝织工的村子里建立，那里通过外来工人（或者，再补充一句，通过家庭劳动）形成了熟悉业务的工作人员’。”
    此外，曹译本中文理不通、晦涩之处还不少，我这里也举一个例子。二○六页注一里有这样的话：“在其出外‘营生’而至少部分地乘火车的乡村工人数目，约为全体工人十分之一……。”这里“至少部分地乘火车”实际上是说“坐过一段火车”的意思。其他如“使用机器……也以经济的极大规模而著称”，“12—17岁的女孩和儿童”（儿童难道不包括女孩吗，应为“男女儿童”）。“无土地化进行得很快”，“在丰收的收获时期”（既是“丰收”，又是“收获”），等等，更是屡见不鲜。
    应该指出，这是一部经典著作，译本是人民出版社出版的，而且已经出过三版；译者一般地被认为是好的翻译家之一，而且据译者的译后记里说，除根据苏联国家政治书籍出版局的新版本校过之外，并对照过英文本和日文本，竟然还有这些明显的错误，是不应该的。译者与出版者都应该重视这个问题，希望能切实地重新校订一番，让这部经典著作能够有较完善的译文和广大读者见面，这样才能更好地帮助读者，才能无愧于这部伟大的著作。
