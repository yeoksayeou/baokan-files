    ·During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement·
    Collect Waste and Scrap Materials to Support Industrial Production
    According to the Changjiang Daily News: The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee, at its recent plenary meeting, adopted measures regarding cleaning warehouses, vigorously collecting waste and scrap materials, and supporting production. It requires all factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, military units, and street residents in the city to actively sort out various waste and scrap materials to support local industrial and handicraft production.
    The difficulty of insufficient raw material supply in current industrial production does exist. One of the ways to overcome this difficulty is to fully utilize the potential strength of various social waste and scrap materials. The potential strength of various waste and scrap materials and stockpiled materials in Wuhan is very large. Last year alone, the Waste Products Management Department of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative recovered waste and scrap materials worth a total of 2.96 million yuan from factories and enterprises in the city. This included 3,329 tons of scrap steel, 150 tons of scrap copper, 720,000 jin of waste cloth, and 870,000 jin of waste paper. These materials played a significant role in solving the problem of material supply for industrial production. However, a large portion of waste and scrap materials in society has not been collected and utilized.
    The Municipal People's Committee requires all enterprises, government offices, and citizens to make cleaning warehouses and vigorously collecting waste and scrap materials a part of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. The scope of collection includes various waste metal products, waste tires and broken rubber shoes, waste paper, broken cloth, broken glass, miscellaneous bones, fish scales, and so on. In order to make the collection of waste and scrap materials a regular and mass-based activity, all enterprises and government offices should also establish a regular system for collecting waste and scrap materials.

    ·在增产节约运动中·
    收集废残物资支持工业生产
    据长江日报讯　武汉市人民委员会在最近召开的全体会议上，通过了关于清理仓库，大力收集废残物资，支持生产的办法，要求全市工厂企业、机关学校、部队及街道居民，积极把各种废残物资清理出来，以支持地方工业和手工业生产。
    当前工业生产中原材料供应不足的困难是存在的，克服这一困难的办法之一，就是充分利用社会各种废残物资的潜在力量。武汉市各种废残物资和积压物资的潜在力量很大，市供销合作社废品经理部去年单是从市内工厂企业中回收的废残物资，总值就达二百九十六万元，其中有废钢铁三千三百二十九吨，废铜一百五十吨，破布七十二万斤，废纸八十七万斤，这些物资对解决工业生产材料供应问题起了很大的作用。但是社会上还有很大一部分废残物资没有被收集起来加以利用。
    市人民委员会要求各企业、机关、市民把清理仓库，大力收集废残物资的工作，作为增产节约运动的一项内容。收集范围包括各种废旧金属制品、废轮胎破胶鞋、废纸、破布、碎玻璃、杂骨、鱼鳞等等。为了使收集废残物资的工作形成一项经常性、群众性的工作，各企业、机关单位还应该建立起经常性的收集废残物资制度。
