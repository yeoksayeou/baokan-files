    Beijing First Commercial Bureau Reminds Commercial Workers:
    Do Not Repeat Past Mistakes
    Criticizing some who, seeing a decline in sales of daily-use industrial products, want to find excuses to cancel contracts for the transfer of certain commodities, or relax efforts to organize supply sources.

    (Our Newspaper) News – The sales volume of eleven companies and purchasing and supply stations in Beijing that deal in daily-use industrial products such as general merchandise, textiles, and cultural goods has been declining since December of last year. December was down 3.4% compared to November, and January of this year was down another 18.12% compared to December. Among these, retail sales fell by 22.52%. The largest declines were in goods such as paper, basketballs and volleyballs, musical instruments, typewriters, ink, cloth for government offices, and woolens. The retail turnover of department stores decreased by 11.45%, and the sales volume of supply and marketing cooperatives decreased by 14.5%. The main reason for the decline is that purchases have decreased since various departments actively carried out the campaign to increase production and practice thrift.

    After these changes appeared in the market, some comrades in some companies developed a blindly optimistic attitude towards future commodity supply work. For example, some comrades in department stores, because sales volume declined and capital turnover became somewhat difficult, wanted to find excuses to cancel the transfer contracts for certain commodities or refuse to pay for goods purchased. Some companies are already complaining about stockpiles and have relaxed their efforts to organize supply sources.

    In response to this situation, the Beijing First Commercial Bureau recently convened a meeting of company managers and business section chiefs, analyzed the current market situation, and criticized the sentiment of blindly optimistic views on the future commodity supply situation and incorrect ideas. At the same time, it warned everyone not to repeat the mistakes that have occurred repeatedly in recent years of first stockpiling and then running out of stock, and then running out of stock and then stockpiling; it is necessary to carefully investigate and analyze the characteristics of the current market changes, correctly arrange this year's purchase and sale plans, and appropriately increase inventory to prepare for peak season supply. The transfer-in, transfer-out, processing, and procurement contracts signed with various regions for the first quarter must be strictly implemented and must not be arbitrarily cancelled, so as not to disrupt the production and sales plans of various regions. For commodities with difficult sales (such as sporting goods, office supplies, woodenware, carpets, etc.), the minimum production level of industry should also be maintained, and efforts should be made in cooperation with industrial departments to produce some inexpensive commodities that meet the needs of the masses, to help these factories solve their current difficulties.

    北京市第一商业局提醒商业工作者
    不要重犯过去的错误
    批评有些人看到日用工业品销售额下降，就想找借口撤销某些商品的调入合同，或放松组织货源工作
    本报讯　北京市经营日用工业品的百货、纺织品和文化用品等十一个公司和采购供应站的销售额，自去年12月起开始下降。去年12月比11月下降了3.4％，今年1月又比12月下降18.12％。其中零售额下降了22.52％。下降最多的是纸张、篮排足球、乐器、打字机、墨水、机关公用布和呢绒等商品。百货公司的零售营业额下降了11.45％，供销合作社的销货额下降了14.5％。下降的主要原因是各部门积极开展增产节约运动以后购买减少了。
    在市场出现了这些变化以后，有些公司的部分同志，对今后的商品供应工作产生了一种盲目乐观的情绪。如百货公司一些同志因销货额下降，资金周转有些困难，就想找借口撤销某些商品的调入合同，或拒付进货款；有的公司已在叫喊积压，放松了组织货源的工作。
    针对这种情况，北京市第一商业局在最近召开了各公司经理和业务科长会议，分析了当前的市场情况，批判了那种对今后的商品供应情况抱着盲目乐观看法的情绪和不正确的想法。同时，警告大家不要重犯几年来不断发生的先积压而后脱销、脱销而后积压的错误；要认真调查和分析目前市场变化的特点，正确安排今年的购销计划，适当增加库存，以备旺季供应。同各地签订的第一季度调入调出和加工收购合同，一律要严肃执行，不得任意撤销，以免打乱各地产销计划。对销售困难的商品（如体育用品、机关用品、木器、地毯等），也应维持工业的最低生产水平，并协同工业部门努力生产一些价格低廉、适合群众需要的商品，帮助这些工厂解决当前的困难。　（晏振陵）
