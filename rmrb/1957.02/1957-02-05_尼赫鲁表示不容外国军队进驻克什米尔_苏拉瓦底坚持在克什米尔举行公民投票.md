Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 4th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in Delhi on the 3rd that India cannot tolerate any foreign troops stationed in Kashmir for even a moment. He said he was surprised that Pakistan wanted to propose in the Security Council that Indian and Pakistani troops should withdraw from Jammu and Kashmir and be replaced by United Nations forces.

    Nehru said at a large public gathering: "No matter what happens, we cannot tolerate foreign troops on our territory. We have seen enough foreign troops in our country."

    After briefly reviewing the history of the Kashmir issue in his speech, Nehru said that to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir, some important conditions must first be implemented. The first condition is that the Pakistani armed forces must completely withdraw from the land of Kashmir. India once asked the United Nations to rule that Pakistan had committed aggression against Kashmir, but the United Nations shelved the issue. Nehru pointed out that, up to now, Pakistani troops have not withdrawn from Kashmir. He also said that in the past eight years, the entire situation in Kashmir has changed, and new facts have occurred.

    Referring to the recent resolution on the Kashmir issue passed by the United Nations Security Council, Nehru said that, unfortunately, some countries in the Security Council were dissatisfied with India for "certain other reasons," and other countries, because they were so involved in military alliances and conventions, especially treaties like the Baghdad Pact, could only act in a special way. Therefore, entirely for other reasons, they helped each other and stood on the same side, without giving serious consideration to the facts regarding this Kashmir issue.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 4th: London, February 2nd: Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy, when meeting with a reporter from the British "Daily Telegraph," expressed his insistence on holding a plebiscite in Kashmir. He said that the Pakistani government could not agree to hold any direct negotiations with New Delhi until a plebiscite was held.

    Suhrawardy attacked neutralism and also attacked communism. He said that the neutralism mentioned by Indian Prime Minister Nehru was "simply a method of deceiving both sides." He also said that India and Egypt wanted to "dominate" the neutral zone from Morocco to Southeast Asia. Suhrawardy also said some things to provoke relations between China and India and other Asian and African countries.

    尼赫鲁表示不容外国军队进驻克什米尔
    苏拉瓦底坚持在克什米尔举行公民投票
    新华社新德里4日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁3日在德里说，印度不能容忍有一刻有任何外国部队驻扎在克什米尔。他说，他对于巴基斯坦想在安全理事会中提出要印度和巴基斯坦军队都从查漠和克什米尔撤退而代之以联合国部队的建议感到惊异。
    尼赫鲁在一个大规模的公众集会上说：“无论发生什么事情，我们都不能容忍外国军队在我们领土上。我们在我们的国家已经看够了外国军队。”
    尼赫鲁在演说中简短回顾了克什米尔问题的历史之后说，要在克什米尔举行公民投票，必须先实行一些重要条件。第一个条件就是巴基斯坦的武装部队必须完全撤出克什米尔的土地。印度曾经要求联合国裁定巴基斯坦对克什米尔进行了侵略，但是联合国搁置了这个问题。尼赫鲁指出，到现在为止，巴基斯坦军队还没有退出克什米尔。他还说，八年来，克什米尔的整个情况有了变化，新的事实发生了。
    尼赫鲁在提到最近联合国安全理事会通过的关于克什米尔问题的决议时说，不幸的是，安全理事会中的一些国家由于“某些其他理由”对印度不满，另外一些国家由于已经那样卷入军事联盟和公约，特别像巴格达条约那样的条约，它们只能以特殊的方式行动。因此，完全是为了其他缘故，它们互相帮助，并且站在同一边，而不对有关这个克什米尔问题的事实给予认真的考虑。
    据新华社4日讯　伦敦2日消息：巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底在接见英国“每日电讯报”记者的时候，表示坚持要在克什米尔举行公民投票的主张。他说，在没有举行公民投票以前，巴基斯坦政府不可能同意跟新德里举行任何直接谈判。
    苏拉瓦底攻击中立主义，也攻击共产主义。他说，印度总理尼赫鲁所说的中立主义“简直是一种欺诈双方的方法”。他并且说印度和埃及要“支配”从摩洛哥起到东南亚止的中立地带。苏拉瓦底还说了一些挑拨中国同印度和其他亚非国家的关系的话。
