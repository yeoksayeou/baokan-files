Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: Representatives attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference today visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.

　　When representatives from provinces such as Shaanxi, Guangdong, and Jiangxi visited the No. 1 blast furnace, the furnace workers were busily preparing to tap the iron. Zhang Mohe and others quickly came forward to receive the guests. Tan Changren (of the Li ethnic group), the director of the Dabao Agricultural Cooperative in Qiongdong County, Hainan Island, who created a double-cropping rice yield of more than 2,500 jin per mu, said to the iron smelting workers: "I have never been to a factory before. Seeing your hard work today, I feel that you are really working hard. I will definitely tell the cooperative members when I go back to produce more grain to support you." Zhang Mohe thanked them on behalf of the iron smelting workers, saying: "Our workers rely on the support of our farmer brothers to produce more. We guarantee to produce more steel to supply you." When Tan Changren parted with Zhang Mohe and others, they even took a photo together as a memento.

　　During the visit, the guests became very interested in the ironmaking and coking production processes. When they learned from the introduction of Jia Yao, the gas foreman of the coking workshop, that the coking workers not only produce coke, but can also recover the emitted coal smoke to make fertilizer powder and other by-products, the agricultural labor models were all surprised and felt that the workers were creating so much wealth for the country.

    农业劳动模范代表参观石景山钢铁厂
    据新华社27日讯　出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的代表们今天参观了石景山钢铁厂。
    当陕西、广东、江西等省的代表们在一号高炉前参观时，炉口工人正在紧张地准备出铁。张墨和等人连忙跑过来接待客人。创双季稻每亩产量二千五百多斤的海南岛琼东县大保农业社主任谭昌任（黎族）对炼铁工人们说：“我从来没有到过工厂，今天亲眼看到你们的劳动情况，感到你们实在辛苦，回去一定告诉社员们，多打粮食，支援你们。”张墨和代表炼铁工人感谢时说：“我们工人生产多靠农民兄弟支援，我们保证多生产钢铁供应你们。”谭昌任同张墨和等分手的时候，还合照一张像片作为纪念。
    在参观中，客人们对炼铁、炼焦的生产过程发生了很大的兴趣。当他们从炼焦车间煤气工长贾耀的介绍中，知道了炼焦工人不仅生产焦炭，还可以把冒出的煤烟回收制成肥田粉等多种副产品的时候，农业劳动模范们都表示惊讶，感到工人们为国家创造的财富实在多。
