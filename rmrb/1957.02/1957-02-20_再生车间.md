    Regeneration Workshop
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Sha Yin
    I recently visited a workshop at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant that specializes in bringing things back to life – the Regeneration Workshop.
    The workshop consists of four rooms; three are built of brick and wood, and one is nailed together with scrap iron sheets. These four rooms house the machinists, ironworkers, fitters, and welders of the Regeneration Workshop. The equipment in the workshop is very simple, with only two old lathes and some fans, grinders, drilling machines, and thread-cutting machines that the workers repaired themselves from scrap materials. The workshop employs thirty-six workers, plus several veteran craftsmen of the seventh and eighth grades.
    When I visited this extraordinary workshop, the lathe operators were machining parts for a welding machine made from scrap materials, while the welders had already wound the coils with scrap copper wire and were baking them with large electric lights. Old workers Gong Xi and Pang You, who showed me around, told me that in a few days, this welding machine, made entirely from scrap, would be put into production; another scrap-based product, a half-ton belt hammer, would also begin assembly.
    In July of last year, due to the tight supply of raw materials, the supply section of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant began to draw workers to prepare for the establishment of this "Regeneration Workshop." However, at the time, there was nothing but two lathes and two pairs of pliers. What to do? The workers searched the scrap yard for usable scrap tools and then used the tools left idle during the production gaps in the metalworking, forging, and iron smelting workshops to repair them. They didn't ask for bricklayers, they built their own kilns; they didn't ask for installation workers, they laid their own pipes and installed their own machines. In this way, the Regeneration Workshop was officially put into production in November of last year.
    From the day the Regeneration Workshop was born, the scrap tools from all the workshops of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, after a trip here, were transformed back into complete tools. The iron smelting department needed a large number of iron rakes, which also wore out very quickly. In the past, those worn-out iron rakes were piled up and sent to the scrap steel pile, becoming steelmaking raw materials. After the establishment of the Regeneration Workshop, the scrap iron rakes from the iron smelting department no longer needed to go into the steelmaking furnace. After being forged and processed by the workers of the Regeneration Workshop, these scrap iron rakes became new iron rakes again. From the establishment of the Regeneration Workshop to the end of January this year, more than 1,400 iron rakes were brought back to life in this workshop. During times of tight transportation, the workers of the Regeneration Workshop used scrap materials to make many parts for automobiles. During times of tight supply of refractory materials, the workers rushed to process more than 100 kilograms of foundation screws for the refractory materials workshop in three days using scrap materials. In addition to repairing and processing scrap for production workshops such as steelmaking, refractory materials, and steel rolling, the Regeneration Workshop has turned 5,500 kilograms of scrap steel into useful machines, tools, and accessories. Old electric switches that had been lying in the scrap yard for five or six years have now also been revived. In the half year from the preparation of the Regeneration Workshop last year to January this year, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant saved more than 29,000 yuan in funds due to the revival of a large number of scrap products.
    The workers of the Regeneration Workshop are even more confident in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. They have already taken a look at the bottom of the scrap warehouse and found that there are more than 780 scrap pressure gauges, electric switches, pipe wrenches, jacks, knife switches, oil switches, electric drills, and magnetos that can be revived through repair and processing. After these things are revived, they will save a large amount of funds for the country. Now, the employees of the Regeneration Workshop have put forward the 1957 savings plan, and they want to save more than 400,000 yuan in funds for the country by reviving scrap products. The old workers I spoke with all considered their work very important. One of the persons in charge of this workshop said to me: "The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is full of gold, and we are the people who pick up gold. If we can pick up more things for the country, we will feel the greatest comfort. Therefore, the thirty of us are all satisfied with our work and have enough confidence to do it well!"

    再生车间
    新华社记者　莎荫
    记者最近访问了太原钢铁厂的一个专门做起死回生工作的车间——再生车间。
    这个车间的四间房子，三间是用砖和木板盖的，一间是用废铁片钉起来的。这四间房子就是再生车间的机工组、铁工组、钳工组和电焊组。安装在这个车间里的设备很简单，只有两台老旧的元车和职工们自己用废料修理成的一些风机、砂轮机、钻床、绞丝车等。全车间有三十六个工人，另外还有几个七、八级的老工匠。
    记者到这个不平常的车间里访问的时候，元车工人们正在为一种用废料修成的电焊机加工零件，而电焊工人们却已经用废铜丝把线圈缠好了，正在用大电灯烤灼。带我参观的老工人弓喜和庞有告诉我：再有几天，这台完全用废料装起来的电焊机就可以投入生产；另一种废料制成品——半吨皮带汽锤，也将开始装配了。
    去年7月，因为原材料供应紧张，太原钢铁厂供应科就着手抽调工人筹建这个“再生车间”。但是，当时除了两部元车和两把老虎钳以外，什么也没有。怎么办呢？工人们就在废料库找寻可以用的废工具，然后利用金工车间、锻工车间、炼铁车间的生产空隙时间闲下来的工具来修理。他们不要瓦工，自己建筑了烘炉；不要安装工人，自己埋管子，自己安装机器。这样，再生车间就在去年11月份正式投入了生产。
    从再生车间诞生的那天起，太原钢铁厂各车间的废工具只要在这里旅行一次，就又变成完好的工具了。炼铁部的铁耙需用量很大，磨损也很厉害。过去那些磨坏了的铁耙成堆成堆地送进废钢堆，变成了炼钢原料；再生车间成立以后，炼铁部的废铁耙就再不要进炼钢炉了，经过再生车间工人锻造、加工，这些废铁耙又变成了新铁耙。从再生车间成立到今年1月底止，就有一千四百多个铁耙在这个车间起死回生。在运输紧张的日子里，再生车间的工人们利用废料给汽车配了许多零件。在耐火材料供应紧张的日子里，工人们又在三天中用废料为耐火材料车间突击加工了一百多公斤地基螺丝。加上给炼钢、耐火材料、轧钢这些生产车间整修、加工过的废品，再生车间已经使五千五百公斤废钢变成了有用的机器、工具和配件。在废品库里躺了五、六年的旧电闸，现在也出世了。从去年再生车间筹备到今年1月的半年中，太原钢铁厂因为有大量废品复活而节省了两万九千多元资金。
    再生车间的工人们在开展增产节约运动中更加信心百倍。他们已经在废品仓库里摸了一次底，发现有七百八十多个废气压表、电闸、管钳、千斤顶、刀闸、油开关、电钻、磁电门可以经过整修、加工复活。这些东西复活以后，将给国家节约大批资金。现在，再生车间的职工们已经提出了1957年的节约方案，他们要通过复活废品，给国家节约四十多万元资金。同我谈话的老工人都把他们的工作看得很重要。这个车间的一位负责人向我说：“太原钢铁厂黄金遍地，我们是拾黄金的人。如果我们能给国家拾回更多的东西来，我们就感到了最大的慰借，因此，我们三十多个人都满意我们的工作，并且有足够的信心把它做好！
