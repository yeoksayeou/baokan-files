    Shaanxi Province has Many Forest Fire-Free Counties
    Last Year, the Area of Forest Fires in the Province Decreased by 90.3% Compared to the Previous Year
    (Report from this newspaper) Compared to 1955, in 1956, the number of forest fires in Shaanxi Province decreased by 72.5%, the burnt area decreased by 90.3%, and the number of trees lost decreased by 80.1%.
    During the crucial fire prevention season last year, counties carried out competitions for forest fire-free zones between counties, districts, and townships, which was the main reason for the reduction in fires. Huanglong, Zhenping, and other counties implemented a joint forest protection system of "zoning and dividing sections, and assigning responsibility to each area" based on agricultural cooperatives. Over the past year, various localities have also constructed some fire prevention facilities in the main forest areas. Currently, the province has established 1,404 lookout towers, cleared more than 1,400 li of firebreaks, set up 150 pedestrian rest stations, 259 propaganda and inspection stations, 842 mountain entry registration stations, and posted more than 19,000 forest protection and fire prevention slogans. Generally, forest fires and wildfires were discovered early, extinguished quickly, and mobilized a large number of people, greatly reducing the extent of the disaster.
    Last year, thirty-six counties (districts) in the province, including Huanglong, Xunyi, Fu County, Lueyang, Zhenping, Shanyang, and Liping, were awarded the title of "Forest Fire-Free County." At the same time, there were fifty-three forest fire-free zones and two hundred and eighty-two forest fire-free townships.
    At the provincial special commissioner and county head conference on January 28 this year, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee rewarded eighteen forest fire-free counties (districts).

    陕西出现许多森林无火灾县
    去年全省山林火灾面积比前年减少了90.3％
    本报讯　1956年同1955年相比，陕西省发生山林火灾的次数减少了72.5％，焚烧面积减少90.3％，林木株数损失减少80.1％。
    各县在去年防火紧要季节，开展了县与县、区与区、乡与乡的无森林火灾区域的竞赛运动，是火灾减少的主要原因。黄龙、镇坪等县以农业社为基础，实行了“分区划段、分片包干”的护林联防制度。一年来各地在主要林区还作了一些防火设施，现在全省已建立了望台一千四百零四个，开辟防火线一千四百多里，设立行人休息站一百五十所，宣传检查站二百五十九个，入山登记站八百四十二个，插设护林防火标语牌一万九千多个。各地对于发生的山火、林火，一般都发现的早，扑灭的快，动员的群众多，使灾害程度大大减少。
    去年，全省有黄龙、栒邑、鄜县、略阳、镇坪、山阳、黎坪等三十六个县（区）都取得了“无林火灾县”的称号。同时有五十三个无林火灾区，二百八十二个无林火灾乡。
    陕西省人民委员会在今年1月28日的全省专员、县长会议上奖励了十八个无林火灾县（区）。
