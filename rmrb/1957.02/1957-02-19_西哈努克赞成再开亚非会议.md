Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 18th: Cambodian Prince Sihanouk said today that the suggestion by Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike to convene the Second Bandung Conference as soon as possible is a good idea.

At a press conference in Colombo, Sihanouk said, "I think it is good to convene the second (Bandung Conference) because it would certainly be meaningful to exchange views on the development of the situation since the first conference."

Referring to the relationship between Cambodia and China, Sihanouk said, "We have very good relations with Zhou Enlai and the Beijing People's Government. We have signed a joint declaration to establish our relations on the basis of Panchasila. At least for the moment, our impression of the Chinese is good."

Referring to Cambodia's foreign policy, Sihanouk said that Cambodia pursues a neutral policy and is friendly to all countries. It has received economic assistance from the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and France, which is within the scope of Cambodia's two-year economic development plan.

When asked about the "Eisenhower Doctrine," he said: "In our country, we are pursuing our own policies. We don't know if that doctrine is good or not."

Referring to the Kashmir issue, he hoped that India and Pakistan would resolve the dispute harmoniously.

Sihanouk arrived in Ceylon on February 13 to attend the释迦牟尼?槃 memorial event.

    新华社18日讯　科伦坡消息：柬埔寨亲王西哈努克今天说，锡兰总理班达拉奈克提出及早召开第二届万隆国家会议的建议是一个好主意。
    西哈努克在科伦坡记者招待会上说：“我认为召开第二届（万隆国家）会议是好的，因为就第一届会议以来的局势发展交换意见必定是有意义的。”
    西哈努克在谈到柬埔寨同中国之间的关系时说：“我们同周恩来和北京人民政府有非常好的关系。我们已经签订了联合宣言，把我们的关系建立在潘查希拉的基础上。至少在目前，我们对中国人的印象是好的。”
    西哈努克在谈到柬埔寨的外交政策时说，柬埔寨奉行的是中立政策，它对一切国家友好。它从美国、苏联、中国和法国得到了经济援助，这种援助是在柬埔寨的两年经济发展计划范围以内的。
    在被问到关于“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，他说：“在我们的国家内，我们正奉行我们自己的政策。我们并不知道那个主义是不是好。”
    在谈到克什米尔问题时，他希望印度和巴基斯坦将和谐地解决这个纠纷。
