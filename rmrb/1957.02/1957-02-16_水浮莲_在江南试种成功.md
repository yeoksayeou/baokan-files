Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Electric Dispatch: The transplanting of "water hyacinth," a pig feed produced in the Pearl River Delta, to the water network areas south of the Yangtze River has been successfully trial-planted at the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute. They used ponds for trial planting, and it can grow in the temperature range of 7 to 37 degrees Celsius, and it reproduces quickly, so it can be harvested every day. From mid-May to mid-October, in five months, each mu of pond yielded more than 40,000 jin of water hyacinth. The Zijinshan Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Nanjing also used this feed to raise more than 300 pigs, reducing the feed cost per pig by one-third.

This year, the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute will supply seedlings to further promote cultivation in southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and it is also planned to conduct trial planting in more aquatic areas north of the Yangtze River.

    “水浮莲”在江南试种成功
    据新华社南京电　把产在珠江三角洲的猪饲料“水浮莲”移植到长江以南的水网地区，已在华东农业科学研究所试种成功。他们利用水塘试种，气温在摄氏七度到三十七度这一段时间内，都能生长，繁殖很快，天天可以采摘。从5月中旬到10月中旬五个月中，每亩水塘收到四万多斤水浮莲。南京市郊区紫金山农业社也用这种饲料喂养三百多头猪，每头猪饲料成本降低三分之一。
    今年将由华东农业科学研究所供应苗种，在江苏南部和浙江一带进一步推广，还打算在长江以北多水地区试种。
