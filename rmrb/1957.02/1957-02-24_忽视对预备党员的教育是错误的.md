Party Member Letter:

    Ignoring the Education of Probationary Party Members is Wrong
    Editor:
    Recently, the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted inspections on the work of probationary party members in some rural townships and towns and found that many party organizations neglected the education of probationary party members.
    There are eighty-two probationary party members in Jianshe Township, Yangzhong County, accounting for half of the party members in the township. However, after accepting them into the Party, the township branch did not give them a single Party lesson in a whole year, nor did it conduct any basic knowledge education on the Party, and did not further examine the political quality of the probationary party members. Therefore, some probationary party members not only do not understand the rights and obligations of party members, but even do not know how long the probationary period is. After the probationary period of the probationary party members expires, the party branch does not discuss their transfer to full membership in a timely manner. Now, sixty-two probationary party members in the township have exceeded the probationary period, including seventeen who have exceeded within half a year, twenty-three who have exceeded more than half a year, eighteen who have exceeded more than one year, three who have exceeded more than two years, and one who has exceeded more than three years, but the party branch has not yet discussed their transfer to full membership. This must be said to be very serious. Some party members said, "We are old probationary party members."
    Neglecting the work of probationary party members has brought serious consequences. Seven probationary party members in the township have developed arrogance after joining the Party, and some have even become corrupt and degenerate. Among them, four probationary party members have completely lost the conditions to be a Communist Party member. In some places, after the probationary period expired, the party organizations hastily transferred them to full membership. For example, Jiang Jinda, a probationary party member in Chainan Township, Yixing County, was not studied by the party group or discussed by the general branch meeting. The branch secretary privately stamped his application and sent it to the district committee. The district committee did not investigate and approved his transfer to full membership. Soon, it was discovered that he had serious problems with his political quality, and he had to be expelled from the Party.
    Why did this situation occur? The main reason is that in the work of deploying the development of the Party to the lower levels, the county and district party organizations have focused closely on the work of developing new party members, with numbers, completion times, experience introductions, and specific measures; however, there are only general calls for how to do the work of probationary party members well, without specific measures. Therefore, these party branches naturally developed the idea of attaching importance to the development of party members and neglecting the education of probationary party members. They believed that as long as a non-Party activist was accepted into the Party, everything would be fine. This is of course completely wrong.
    The Party has always believed that doing a good job in the work of probationary party members is an important step in developing the Party, consolidating the Party, and improving the quality of party members, and it is also an important task for every party branch. Accepting a non-Party activist as a probationary party member is only the first step in Party building. What is more important is to conduct ideological education and examinations of political quality, etc., for each probationary party member during the probationary period, so that everyone who is accepted into the Party meets the requirements. Attaching importance only to development work and not to the education and transfer to full membership of probationary party members is harmful to Party building work.
    We hope that these party organizations will quickly change this situation.

### 忽视对预备党员的教育是错误的

    忽视对预备党员的教育是错误的
    编辑同志：
    最近，中共江苏省委组织部在一些农村乡、镇，进行了关于预备党员工作的检查，发现有不少党组织忽视对预备党员的教育工作。
    扬中县建设乡共有八十二名预备党员，占全乡党员的半数。但是，这个乡支部在接收他们入党以后整整一年内，没有给他们上过一次党课，也没有向他们进行过一次党的基础知识教育，更没有对预备党员的政治品质进一步加以考察。因此，有些预备党员，不但不懂得党员的权利与义务，甚至连预备期多长也不知道。在预备党员预备期满以后，党支部也不按时讨论他们的转正问题。现在全乡已有六十二名预备党员超过了预备期，其中超过半年以内的十七名，半年以上的二十三名，一年以上的十八名，二年以上的三名，三年以上的一名，但党支部至今还未去讨论他们的转正问题。这不能不说是十分严重的。有的党员说：“我们是老预备党员。”
    忽视对预备党员进行工作带来了严重的后果，全乡有七名预备党员在入党以后，滋长了骄傲情绪，有的甚至腐化堕落，其中有四名预备党员已经完全丧失了做一个共产党员的条件。还有些地方，在预备期满以后，党组织草草率率地把他们转为正式党员。如宜兴县柴南乡预备党员蒋金大，既没有经过党小组的研究，也没有经过支部大会讨论，由支部书记私人盖了章就送至区委，区委也没有调查，就批准他转为正式党员。不久，发现他政治品质上有严重问题，又不得不将他开除出党。
    为什么发生这一情况呢？主要原因是县、区党组织在向下布置发展党的工作中，对发展新党员的工作抓得很紧，有数字、有完成的时间，还有经验介绍和具体措施；但是对怎样做好预备党员的工作，只有一般号召，没有具体措施，因而，这些党支部就很自然的产生了重视发展党员，忽视教育预备党员的思想，他们认为只要把一个非党积极分子接收入党以后就“万事大吉”了。这当然是完全错误的。
    党历来认为，做好预备党员的工作，是发展党、巩固党、提高党员质量的一个重要步骤，也是每个党支部的重要任务。把一个非党积极分子接收为预备党员，仅是建党工作的第一步，更重要的是对每一个预备党员在预备期间进行思想教育和政治品质等方面的考察，使接收到党内的每个人都合乎条件。只重视发展工作，不重视预备党员的教育和转正工作，这对建党工作是有害的。
    我们希望这些党组织赶快改变这种状况。
