Nautical Tales (Fable)
    Wu Yan
    A friend of mine returned from a sea voyage. What was originally a two-day trip took him eight days to get home.
    "Why was it so slow?"
    "Because everyone was responding to the Hundred Schools of Thought campaign, advocating independent thinking."
    "Ah?"
    "Everyone was discussing new methods for sailing ships. Someone who considered himself courageous in breaking conventions resolutely insisted: with independent thinking, we can navigate the sea without compasses or anything like that. 'Right or wrong, let's test it on the spot!'"
    "The result was you being tossed about on the vast, bitter sea for eight days and nights, missing even the New Year's Eve dinner."
    "You're half right... The result was that, due to the lessons of reality, we still relied on the compass to determine direction, allowing me to return home in time for the joy of the Spring Festival!"

    航海奇谈（寓言）
    吴岩
    有个朋友从海道归来，原是两天的路程，却走了八天才到家。
    “为什么这样慢呢？”
    “因为大家响应百家争鸣，主张独立思考。”
    “啊？”
    “大家讨论驾驶海船的新方法。有个自以为勇于打破成规的人坚决主张：凭着独立思考，没有罗盘针什么的也能在大海上航行。——对不对，当场试验！”
    “结果是害你在茫茫苦海上颠簸了八天八夜，连年夜饭也没有赶上。”
    “你说对了一半。……结果是由于事实的教训，还是凭着罗盘针确定方向，使我能回到家里赶上了春节的欢乐！”
