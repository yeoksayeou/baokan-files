Glimpses of South America

"No Entry Without Formal Attire"

Brazilian theatrical life still retains many "ancient customs." For example, the premiere of each play, especially the first performance of a foreign troupe, is called "Black Tie," meaning that the audience must wear formal attire to enter that day. It is said that sometimes people who receive invitations to such premieres or happen to buy tickets for this performance often worry about black clothes and black bow ties. Because the invitation or ticket clearly states: "Please wear a smoking jacket (formal attire)" or "No entry without black attire." And ordinary people don't wear black clothes very often in a year, so who has the extra money to sew a set to keep at the bottom of the box?

The first performance of the Chinese Art Troupe in Rio de Janeiro, in the words of local friends, was not only a major event in cultural life, but also a major event in social life. Because, Brazil also has rumors that Chinese Peking Opera has influenced Parisian fashion. Western women really can't think of any new tricks for "rayon" and "nylon," and Chinese silk is exactly what women yearn for. During the first performance of Chinese drama, many socialite ladies had to consider the material and style of new clothes.

On that day, the wives of several members of parliament, lawyers, and writers who had visited China were the most noticed, because they were wearing real Chinese silk. But even more attention was paid to the wife of a cabinet minister, who wore a "bifu" (Mandarin square) from the Qing Dynasty, which was the bifu of a fourth-rank official. Some parts of the sleeves and collar were broken due to the age. This lady wore this official uniform of the Qing Dynasty as a coat, and during the intermission of the performance, she asked Chinese guests to identify the age of the garment. One of our friends looked at this rather dilapidated garment and guessed that it might be two or three hundred years old. This identification made the lady shout with joy, and she immediately ran around to tell all her acquaintances. She also said: "That is to say, when the residents of many places in Brazil were still wearing leaves, China already had such beautiful clothes."

The lobby of the theater was like a fashion exhibition venue, but the men's clothes were always the black, so-called "smoking jackets" with or without satin edges. Experts could only judge whether the style was fashionable or not from the amount of chest exposed and whether the corners of the clothes were square or round.

More interestingly, when we later performed in Sao Paulo, because too many people wanted to order tickets for the opening performance, and the good seats in the theater could not accommodate all the reservations, we had to hold two opening performances. For the first two days, all the male audiences wore black "smoking jackets" (the audience in the boxes also had to wear white stiff shirts), and the women wore long, shoulder-baring evening gowns.

"Lian Lian" and "Black Eyes"

Brazilians like to talk about everything in their hometown with a proud expression. If you meet someone from northern Brazil, they will tell you that "most of Brazil's national revolutionary heroes are northerners; and the fruits of the north are also unmatched anywhere else in Brazil."

Indeed, in northern Brazil, there are various tropical and subtropical fruits. A kind of jackfruit that we call "Lian Lian" has a strong, special aroma that makes people who have never eaten it afraid to touch it, but overseas Chinese who have lived abroad for a long time will tell you that the more you eat this fruit, the more you love it, so it is called "Lian Lian" (lingering), and eating too much will make you linger in a foreign land.

Another kind of berry like a plum, you put it in your mouth and spit out the pit and skin, leaving some fragrant sweet pulp in your mouth. If you accidentally break the skin, you will taste a bitter taste. Brazilians in the north call this fruit "Jabuticaba," which means black eyes, saying that the black skin of this fruit is as beautiful as a girl's black eyes. They talk about this fruit with great enthusiasm, and complain that you can't eat good "black eyes" in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. When we also tried to taste this delicacy, a Brazilian friend joked and said: "Be careful, all the black-eyed girls, if you don't handle them well, will make you taste bitter and astringent."

    南美见闻

    “非穿礼服不得入场”
    巴西的戏剧生活中，还保存着许多“古风”。比如说，每个戏的首次公演，特别是一个外国剧团的首次演出，被称为“黑领结”，意思是这一天的观众必须穿礼服才能入场。据说，有时人们接到这种首次演出的邀请或者碰巧买上这一场戏票，常为黑衣服和黑领结发愁。因为请帖或票子上写得很清楚：“请穿吸烟服（常礼服）”或者“非穿黑色衣服不得入场”。而一般人，黑色的衣服一年也穿不上好多次，谁有余钱去缝上一套来压箱底呢。
    中国艺术团在里约热内卢的首次演出，用当地朋友的话说，不仅是文化生活上的重大事件，也是社交生活的重大事件。因为，巴西也流传着中国京戏影响了巴黎时装的谈论。西方的妇女对于“人造丝”和“尼龙”也真的想不出什么新花样了，中国丝绸正是妇女们向往的东西。在中国戏剧首次演出时，许多社交界的贵妇人不得不考虑一下新衣服的质料和式样了。
    那一天，几位访问过中国的议员、律师、作家的夫人最受人们的注意，因为她们身上穿的是真正的中国丝绸。但更受人们注意的还是一位阁员的夫人，她穿了一件中国清代的“补服”，是一位四品官的补服，袖口、领口有些地方因为年深代久都破了。这位夫人把这件中国清代的官服当作外衣，当演出中途休息的时刻，便请中国客人来鉴定一下这件衣服的年代。我们之间有一位朋友看了这件已经相当破旧的衣服，推测可能有二、三百年了。这个鉴定使这位夫人高兴得叫了起来，立即跑来跑去告诉她所有的相识者。她并且说：“那就是说，当我们巴西许多地方的居民还穿着树叶的时候，中国已经有如此美丽的服装了。”
    剧院的大厅就像是时装展览的会场，但男人的服装总也不过是黑色的或有缎边或没有缎边的所谓“吸烟服”，行家们只能从胸口开敞的多少和衣角是方是圆来判断式样的时髦与否罢了。
    更有兴味的是，我们后来到圣保罗演出时，因为有太多的人要订购开幕演出的票子，而剧院的好位子不能容纳所有的订座者，只好举行两次开幕演出。头两天，所有的观众男的一律是黑色“吸烟服”（包厢的观众还要用白色的硬胸呢。）女的则是长裙露肩的夜礼服。
    “流连”和“黑眼睛”
    巴西人喜欢用一种自傲的神情谈论自己家乡的一切。如果你遇见了巴西北方人，他会告诉你“巴西的民族革命英雄大多是北方人；而北方的水果也是全巴西任何别处赶不上的。
    的确，在巴西北方，有着热带和亚热带的各种水果。我们叫做
  “流连”的一种树菠萝，强烈的特殊的香味使没有吃过的人不敢碰它，但久居国外的华侨都会告诉你，这种水果越吃越爱吃，所以叫“流连”，吃多了就在异乡流连忘返了。
    另一种像李子一样的浆果，放在嘴里把核和皮吐出去，剩在嘴里的便是一些有香味的甜浆。如果你不当心把皮咬破了，便会尝到一种苦涩的味道。巴西北方人管这种水果叫“雅普提卡巴”，意思是黑眼睛，说这种水果的黑皮像姑娘的黑眼睛一样美丽。他们谈起这种水果简直是眉飞色舞，并且抱怨在里约热内卢和圣保罗吃不到好的“黑眼睛”。当我们也试着尝尝这种美味时，一位巴西朋友打趣地说：“小心，所有的黑眼睛姑娘，弄得不好都会使你吃到又苦又涩的味道的。”
                        （未完）
