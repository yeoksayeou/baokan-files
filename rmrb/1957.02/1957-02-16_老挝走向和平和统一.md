    Laos Moves Towards Peace and Unity
    By Bei Que Di, Reporter for French Newspaper "l'Humanité"
    As you fly from Hanoi to Vientiane, the capital of Laos, you see a continuous range of mountains covered with vegetation, so close together that it seems unlikely that humans could live among these deep valleys and steep ravines. Only as you approach the Mekong River, which flows from Tibet, do the mountains gradually descend, and the vast plains stretch out, with villages clearly visible. If the plane flies low over the ridges, you can see small patches of cultivated land cleared from the jungle on the mountaintops, and sometimes patches of cultivated land on the mountainsides, with glimpses of verdant rice paddies from the narrow gaps in the valleys. But apart from the fertile Mekong River plain, Laos is a country of densely forested, sparsely populated mountains and plateaus.
    The Kingdom of Laos covers an area of approximately 230,000 square kilometers, more than twice the combined area of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. As for the population, no one knows for sure. Official estimates range from 1.5 million to 2.5 million. Unofficial estimates are much higher. At least in recent years, the population of Laos has never been counted. Official estimates are based on the taxpayer registers of the former French colonial authorities. But it is said that the Lao people go to great lengths to avoid having their names entered in the register and conceal the true size of their families on every occasion. One of the main sources of tax revenue for the French colonialists was extorting poll taxes, from which no member of any family, from the oldest grandmother to the newborn infant, was exempt. In the mountains, whenever the tax collectors were about to arrive, the villagers simply abandoned their homes and fled deep into the jungle to establish new villages in the most difficult places to find. Even in the plains and valleys, pregnant women would avoid markets and pagodas from the moment the external signs of pregnancy appeared, to evade the tax collectors and prevent them from knowing that another victim of taxation was about to be born.
      "Divide and rule," the old maxim of imperialism, has been newly applied in this part of the world, which greatly increases the difficulty of travel. The United States' policy here is to prevent Laos and Cambodia from being "infected" by the progressive regime of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, while also trying to prevent Laos from being "infected" by the neutralist regime of Cambodia. Thus, for an ordinary traveler, a Cambodian, or a Laotian, there is no way to travel to Hanoi, nor is it possible to travel directly between the capitals of Laos and Cambodia, even though they are close neighbors and until recently belonged to the unified administrative region of French Indochina. There are air routes from Vientiane, the capital of Laos, to Saigon in South Vietnam, Bangkok in Thailand, and even Hong Kong, but there is no route to its close neighbors, Hanoi or Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. Similarly, there are air routes from Phnom Penh to Saigon and Bangkok, but not between Phnom Penh and Hanoi or Vientiane. Whenever the issue of normalizing air transport is raised, the Americans who provide transport planes to the Lao and Cambodian airlines threaten to cut off the supply of spare parts for stone and oil aircraft. The only air link between Saigon-Phnom Penh-Vientiane and Hanoi is the postal plane of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission, which only carries the Commission's staff and some journalists commissioned by the Commission. Similarly, whenever Laos and Cambodia raise the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries or establishing diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the United States threatens to cut off "economic aid" to the two countries. There is also no trade between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Cambodian or Vietnamese currency cannot be exchanged in Laos; Lao currency has no value in Cambodia.
    This policy of isolating neighbors, long practiced by the French and now used by self-proclaimed new masters of imperialism, is similarly reflected in the domestic situation in Laos. Since the Geneva Accords guaranteed the independence of Laos, the goal of American policy has always been to maintain and expand the domestic disputes in Laos, some of which have traditional foundations and some of which were created by the French. The events that have taken place in Laos over the past century, and especially in the last twelve years, are rich material for a great historical drama.
    When the French began annexing Laos in the 1880s, there were actually three independent kingdoms. The capital of one was Luang Prabang in the north; the capital of another was Vientiane in the center; and the capital of the third was Champasak in the south. The French supported the Kingdom of Luang Prabang (actually limiting the king's power to the city of Luang Prabang). The other two kingdoms were also recognized by the French, but mainly used to exert necessary pressure on the Kingdom of Luang Prabang.
    In August 1945, at the same time as uprisings broke out in Vietnam and Cambodia, an organized uprising broke out throughout Laos to seize the power that the Japanese had taken from the French a few months earlier. The insurgents declared national independence and organized armed forces to resist the French, who were supported by the British and attempted to rebuild their colonial rule. The leader of the Lao national independence movement was Prince Souphanouvong, the son of the former King of Vientiane. He was a capable engineer, a specialist in road and bridge construction. When he was studying in France, he came into contact with progressive student groups; when he was an engineer in Vietnam, he had contact with the Vietnamese revolutionary movement. Also participating in this movement was Prince Souvanna Phouma, Souphanouvong's brother. He had obtained three engineering degrees: naval engineering, electrical engineering, and civil engineering. Another brother, Prince Phetsarath, served as the honorary head of the provisional government of national independence. He was an experienced printing expert. After the death of the king, he took on the responsibilities of a father for his brothers. Under French rule, Prince Phetsarath had served as vice-king, second only to the reigning King Sisavang Vong. The independence movement was supported by the people of the whole country, but its political power was almost entirely based in some urban centers. Therefore, after launching a barbaric sweep, and carrying out cruel bombing and shelling of the cities, the French regained control of the whole country. The provisional government led the remaining armed forces to retreat to Thailand.
    Faced with the situation of nationwide unity in Laos as embodied in the uprising, the French, shortly after regaining control, made a gesture of giving Laos a constitutional unity. They "persuaded" Prince Boun Oum of Champasak, who had not participated in the uprising, to renounce his rule over the Kingdom of Champasak. As Phetsarath, the successor to the Kingdom of Vientiane, was in exile abroad, the French declared the King of Luang Prabang to be the sole ruler of a unified Laos. In order to weaken the position of the government in exile, which was recognized by the Lao people as the true government of the country, the French promulgated a constitution in Laos in May 1947, giving Laos some semblance of independence, while the French had already launched a full-scale war against the Vietnamese people. There were differences of opinion among the members of the government in exile in Thailand, which were reflected in the different decisions taken by the three brothers. Souphanouvong analyzed the reasons for their military defeat, believing that it was mainly because the resistance relied only on the cities and not on the countryside. He believed that true independence could only be won through armed struggle. He reorganized the troops loyal to the cause and returned to the jungle to organize and lead a long-term national liberation war. Souvanna Phouma believed that the French had taken steps to make Laos "independent," which provided a basis for achieving true independence through political means. He returned to Vientiane and took a seat in the French-controlled government. Phetsarath hesitated: he did not participate in the armed struggle, but he also did not accept the French's repeated invitations for him to return home as vice-king. He remained in Thailand.
    Before the Geneva armistice agreements affirmed the collapse of French colonialism in Indochina, the Lao People's Liberation Army, led by Souphanouvong, with the assistance of Vietnamese volunteers, had already liberated half of Lao territory. They played an extremely important role in preventing the French colonial army from reinforcing Dien Bien Phu through Laos.
    According to the Geneva armistice agreements, the Lao People's Liberation Army withdrew from ten provinces in central and southern Laos to the two northern provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, pending a final settlement of the Lao question through consultation, which would stipulate the legal political activities of the Lao People's Liberation Army personnel. However, after the Geneva Conference, the United States began to intervene in Lao affairs, attempting to re-ignite the civil war in Laos and undermine the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Laos. However, the Royal Army was unwilling to wage war against those who were the best patriots of Laos. In early 1956, the Lao government, which had consistently refused to negotiate and tried to eliminate the Lao People's Liberation Army, collapsed; a government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma came to power. The Phouma government guaranteed to stop the bloodshed and to conduct sincere negotiations with the Lao People's Liberation Army. American diplomats in Vientiane had tried every means to prevent these negotiations, but they failed.
    Finally, a great historical moment arrived: in July of last year, when Prince Souphanouvong, the creator and leader of the Lao People's Liberation Army, stepped out of the cabin at Vientiane Airport, his brother, Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma, stepped forward and embraced him tightly. The two brothers quickly reached an agreement on the general principles guiding the negotiations. Then began long and difficult negotiations. Whenever a concrete agreement was reached, the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane would exert pressure and make threats, which made the negotiations longer and more difficult. From November 6 to December 23, 1956, the two sides reached three separate agreements: the October 31, 1956 agreement on the cessation of hostilities, the November 2, 1956 agreement on a policy of peace and neutrality, and the December 24, 1956 agreement guaranteeing the civil rights of members of the Lao People's Liberation Army and its supporters.
    The six-point agreement on peace and neutrality stipulated that Lao foreign policy should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, establish diplomatic relations with "neighboring countries," accept economic assistance from all countries without conditions, refuse to participate in any military alliances or establish foreign military bases on Lao territory, and exchange cultural and economic delegations with neighboring countries. The twelve-point agreement on guaranteeing civil rights stipulated that the political organization of the Lao People's Liberation Army, the "Patriotic Front," should enjoy all facilities for organization, newspaper publication, assembly, and participation in elections, without any discrimination; and stipulated that administrative cadres of the Lao People's Liberation Army should participate in government agencies.
    In order to implement these agreements, the two princes signed a joint communiqué on December 28, 1956, stipulating that the current Royal Government should be reorganized into a coalition government including personnel from the Lao People's Liberation Army. After the reorganization of the government, supplementary elections would be held, and the National Assembly, which currently has thirty-nine representatives, would elect twenty-one more representatives. The increase in the number of representatives was due to the increase in population and the acceptance of the Lao People's Liberation Army delegation's request to grant women the right to vote for the first time in Lao history.
    Obviously, these things were not to the liking of the United States. The "divide and rule" policy that imperialists had long used to rule Laos was on the verge of bankruptcy. The United States threatened to cut off "economic aid" if Laos implemented the above-mentioned measures, but this threat was met with indifference. Now that the two brothers had agreed to take necessary measures to achieve national unity, the U.S. Embassy began to look for new allies. They thought of the elderly Phetsarath, who was in exile in Thailand. Wouldn't he be willing to return to "save" Laos? Yes, he was willing to return home as vice-king. A Lao delegation visited him in Bangkok and learned that he would only be willing to return home after the coalition government was formed. He declared that he fully agreed with the agreements reached by both sides. This attitude was unexpected by the United States. They had to look for another object, so they thought of Prince Boun Oum, the former king of Champasak, who was the brother-in-law of the pro-American Prime Minister Katay. Katay had long refused to negotiate with the Lao People's Liberation Army and eventually lost his position as prime minister because of this. The U.S. Ambassador persuaded Boun Oum to abolish his abdication and demand to be king of Champasak again. Boun Oum accepted this suggestion. Thus, with the support of the British, the Americans formed a core around Boun Oum and Katay to oppose the agreements and the Souvanna Phouma government.
    Katay went to the United States and participated in a special anti-communist lecture hosted by the U.S. State Department, where he studied the U.S. State Department's version of "Marxism-Leninism." This lecture was specifically designed for "important" visitors, with the aim of ensuring that participants would become anti-communist experts equipped with "Marxist-Leninist" quotes within a few weeks.
    A few days after Souphanouvong left Vientiane and returned to the Sam Neua base to make final preparations for participating in the National Coalition Government, Katay also returned from the United States and launched a fierce offensive against the Lao People's Liberation Army, the Souvanna Phouma government, and the agreements. Because he had lost the support of most of the members of his own party, he created a "shadow" party called the "Defenders of the Kingdom," publishing almost appeals on his newspaper, calling for the overthrow of the Souvanna Phouma government. At the same time as Katay returned home, American weapons were smuggled into Laos from Thailand across the Mekong River at night, and distributed to elements bought by the United States to launch an armed coup. The U.S. Ambassador suggested to the British and French Ambassadors in Vientiane that they jointly make efforts to overthrow the Souvanna Phouma government by legal or "other" means. The British agreed, but the French refused. The French refusal meant that at least "legal" means would not be successful. In the third week of January, British and American "anti-subversion" experts began to arrive in Vientiane, including personnel from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Colonel Lambert, the head of the Far East Security Intelligence Bureau of the British Secret Service. At the same time, Vientiane was teeming with Thai "travelers." It is not clear whether all of the above was a kind of pressure to force Souvanna Phouma to cancel the agreements, or part of a widely rumored conspiracy to overthrow it when the coalition government was established. However, one thing is clear, the United States and Britain are racking their brains to prevent the agreements that have been reached from being implemented. They openly threatened that if all their methods failed, they would support Boun Oum in establishing a separatist regime in the south allied with Thailand, as a base for carrying out activities against the Lao coalition government.
    Whether these conspiracies can succeed is highly doubtful. The people support Souvanna Phouma's foreign policy of peace, unity, and independence. The Lao People's Liberation Army enjoys great prestige throughout the country. Souphanouvong is a popular figure, who is supported by the Orthodox because he has excellently fulfilled the duties of a prince on the social stage. In Lao society, people expect kings and princes to command armies in times of war and to personally represent the people in negotiations to strive for peace. He is supported by intellectuals because he is one of the very few Lao people who have received higher education and obtained degrees upon graduation. The people call him a people's hero because he has shared weal and woe with the people and led the people in a long-term armed struggle for national independence. Apart from Katay and a small handful of elements who go against the will of the people, no one dares to openly oppose the agreements, for fear of being called a "national traitor."
    After spending a week in Vientiane, and returning, flying over those continuous purple mountain ranges again; the mountaintops were shrouded in white clouds, appearing very peaceful, which was in stark contrast to the atmosphere of conspiracy seething in the Lao capital. At this time, one may be able to discover the key to the frenzied activities of the American diplomats in Laos. On the northwest side of those mountains is the border of the People's Republic of China, and on the northeast side is the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These two northern provinces of Laos seem to be a dagger inserted into the People's China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The United States has spent a lot of dollars on them and has made the Lao people shed rivers of blood. Laos has been used as the sharp edge of the Southeast Asia Treaty to stab into China's abdomen and insert into the flank of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This knife was originally an attempt by the United States to take timely action on the consolidated base of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization consisting of South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. But now Cambodia has refused to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty, insisting on neutrality and peaceful coexistence, which has broken a pillar of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and given the United States' plan a major blow. If the Vientiane joint communiqué of December 28 of last year and the attached agreements are effectively implemented, this means that Laos will not only not act as a sharp knife, but on the contrary, it will extend a hand of friendship to China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is a fatal blow to the Southeast Asia Treaty. In any case, this would be a complete failure of American policy in this part of the world.
    The Lao people and their leaders have clearly expressed that they are willing to live in peace and friendship with their neighbors, and will never be tools of imperialist war policies. But no one here underestimates the activities that the planners of American policy may carry out to reverse their defeat. Therefore, the Lao people must remain vigilant.

    老挝走向和平和统一
    法国“人道报”记者　贝却敌
    当你从河内飞向老挝的首都万象时，在你的面前出现了连绵的草木丛生的山脉，一座座挨得那样紧，看来在这深谷陡壑之间很难有人类居住的余地。只是当你飞近那条从西藏奔腾而下的湄公河时，山脉才逐渐下倾，广阔的平原伸展开来，村庄历历在目。要是飞机低飞着掠过山脊的话，你就能看到山顶上从丛林中开辟出的小块垦地，有时在山侧也有着一片片开垦过的土地，从山谷的狭缝里不时闪过碧绿的稻田。但是除了肥沃的湄公河平原之外，老挝是一个林木茂密、居民稀少的山地和高原的国度。
    老挝王国的面积约二十三万多平方公里，相当于比利时、荷兰和瑞士三国面积总和的一倍以上。至于人口，谁也不清楚。官方的估计从一百五十万到二百五十万不等。非官方的估计大大超过上述数字。至少近年来，老挝的人口一直未曾作过统计。官方估计的根据是过去法国殖民当局的纳税人登记簿。但是据说老挝人想尽一切办法不使自己的名字列入登记簿，并在任何场合都隐瞒他们家庭的真正人口。法国殖民者税收的主要来源之一是勒索人头税，每一个家庭的每一个成员，从最老的祖母到初生的婴儿都不能幸免。在山区里，每当收税人快要到来时，村民们就干脆舍弃了他们的家园，逃到丛林深处最难被发现的地方去建立新村。甚至在平原和河谷里，怀孕的妇女从怀孕的外部征象一出现起就不再去市场和宝塔，以躲避收税人的耳目，使他们不知道又有一个赋税的受害者要出世了。
      “分而治之”，帝国主义的这句老格言在世界的这一部分地区得到了新的应用，这就大大地增加了旅行的困难。美国在这里的政策是防止老挝和柬埔寨被越南民主共和国的进步的政权所“感染”，同时也力图防止老挝被柬埔寨的中立主义政权所“感染”。这样，对一个普通的旅行者、一个柬埔寨人或者老挝人来说，是没有办法到河内去旅行的，也不可能直接来往于老挝和柬埔寨两国的首都之间，尽管他们都是紧邻，而且在不久前还同属于印度支那法国殖民地的统一的行政区。从老挝的首都万象到南越的西贡和泰国的曼谷甚至到香港都有航空线，但和它的紧邻的河内或者柬埔寨的首都金边却无路可通。同样，从金边到西贡和曼谷也都有航空线，可是金边和河内、万象之间却没有。每当空运正常化的问题提出来的时候，为老挝和柬埔寨航空公司提供运输机的美国人就以中断石和油飞机零件的供应相威胁。唯一从空中联结西贡—金边—万象和河内的是国际监督和监察委员会的邮机，但它也只载送委员会的工作人员以及受委员会所委托的一些新闻记者。每当老挝和柬埔寨提出建立两国邦交的问题，或者提出和越南民主共和国建立外交关系的问题时，美国同样威胁要中断对这两国的“经济援助”。在越南民主共和国、老挝和柬埔寨三国之间，也没有贸易往来。柬埔寨或者越南民主共和国的货币在老挝无法兑换；老挝的货币在柬埔寨也没有价值。
    这种为法国人所长期奉行而今天又为自封的帝国主义新主人所运用的隔离邻居的政策，同样反映在老挝的国内局势中。自从日内瓦协议保证老挝的独立地位以来，美国政策的目标一向是在于保持和扩大老挝国内的纠纷，这些纠纷有的是有传统的基础的，有的则是法国人制造出来的。过去一个世纪中，特别是在最近十二年中，在老挝发生的事件足以为一部伟大的历史剧提供丰富的素材。
    当法国人在十九世纪八十年代开始并吞老挝的时候，实际上存在着三个各自为政的王国。其中一国的首府是北部的琅勃剌邦；另一国的首府是中部的万象；第三国的首府在南部的占巴塞。法国人支持琅勃剌邦王国（实际上把国王的权力限制在琅勃剌邦城的范围之内）。其他两个王国也为法国所承认，但主要是被用来对琅勃剌邦王国施加必需的压力的。
    1945年8月，在越南和柬埔寨爆发起义的同时，老挝全国爆发了有组织的起义，以夺取日本人在数月以前从法国人手里取得的政权。起义者宣告了民族独立，组织了武装部队以抵抗得到英国支持、企图重建殖民统治的法国人。老挝民族独立运动的领导人是前万象王国国王的儿子——年轻的苏发努冯亲王。他是一位能干的工程师、道路和桥梁建筑的专家。当他在法国读书的时候，他就和进步的学生团体有了接触；他在越南当工程师时又和越南革命运动有过接触。参加这个运动的还有苏发努冯的哥哥梭发那·富马亲王。他曾获得三个工程师学位：海运工程师、电气工程师和建筑工程师。另一个哥哥佩特萨拉特亲王，充任民族独立临时政府的名誉首脑，他是一位有经验的印刷专家。他在国王去世后曾对他的兄弟们负起父亲的职责。在法国人的统治下，佩特萨拉特亲王曾经担任过副国王，地位仅次于在位的西萨望·汪国王。独立运动得到全国人民的支持，但是它的政治权力几乎完全建筑在一些城市中心的基础上。因此法国人在发动了野蛮的扫荡，对城市进行残酷的轰炸和炮击以后，就重新控制了全国。临时政府率领了仅存的一些武装部队撤到泰国。
    面对着在起义中所体现的老挝举国团结的形势，法国人在重新取得统治后不久便作出姿态，表示要给予老挝以合乎宪法的统一。他们“说服”没有参加起义的占巴塞王国的国王蓬温，放弃了他对占巴塞王国的统治权。作为万象王国继承者的佩特萨拉特又流亡在国外，所以法国人宣布琅勃剌邦国王是统一后的老挝的唯一统治者。为了削弱被老挝人民公认为这个国家的真正政府的流亡政府的地位，法国人在1947年5月在老挝颁布了一个宪法，给老挝以某种表面的独立，而当时法国人已经发动了对越南人民的全面战争。在泰国的流亡政府的成员中存在着意见上的分歧，这些分歧反映在三个兄弟所采取的不同的决定上。苏发努冯分析了他们军事上失败的原因，认为主要是由于抗战只依靠城市进行，而没有依靠乡村去进行。他认为要赢得真正的独立只有通过武装斗争。他整顿了忠于这个事业的部队，回到丛林中去组织和领导了长期的民族解放战争。梭发那·富马认为法国人采取了使老挝“独立”的步骤，这就提供了通过政治手段来取得真正独立的基础。他回到了万象，在法国控制的政府中取得了一席地位。佩特萨拉特犹豫不决：他没有参加武装斗争，但也没有接受法国人几次要他回国当副国王的邀请。他一直留在泰国。
    在日内瓦停战协议肯定了法国殖民主义在印度支那的崩溃以前，苏发努冯领导的寮国战斗部队在越南志愿人员的援助下已经解放了老挝领土的一半。他们对阻止法国殖民军通过老挝增援奠边府起了极其重要的作用。
    按照日内瓦停战协议，寮国战斗部队从老挝中部和南部十个省撤退到北部的桑怒和丰沙里两个省，以待通过协商求得老挝问题的最后解决，这种解决办法将要规定寮国战斗部队人员的合法的政治活动。但是，在日内瓦会议以后，美国开始插手了老挝事务，企图重新挑起老挝的内战，破坏日内瓦协议在老挝的实施。但是，王国军队不愿对那些老挝的最优秀的爱国者进行战争。1956年初，一贯拒绝协商并竭力想消灭寮国战斗部队的老挝政府倒台了；以梭发那·富马亲王为首的政府上台执政。富马政府保证停止流血战争并和寮国战斗部队进行真诚的谈判。在万象的美国外交人员曾千方百计地企图阻止这种谈判，但是他们失败了。
    终于，一个伟大的历史性的时刻到来了：去年7月间当寮国战斗部队的创造者和领导者苏发努冯亲王在万象机场步出机舱时，他的哥哥梭发那·富马亲王首相就走上前去紧紧地拥抱了他。两兄弟在指导谈判的一般原则上很快地达成了协议。接着开始了长期而困难重重的谈判。每当一项具体协议达成时，万象的美国使馆就施加压力和进行威胁，这就使得谈判变得更长和更困难了。从1956年11月6日到12月23日双方达成了三项单独的协议：1956年10月31日签订的停止敌对行动的协议、1956年11月2日签订的关于和平中立政策的协议，和1956年12月24日签订的保障寮国战斗部队的成员和它的支持者的公民权利的协议。
    关于和平中立的六点协议规定了老挝的外交政策应该依据和平共处的五项原则，和“贴邻的国家”建立外交关系；接受不附加条件的所有国家的经济援助；拒绝参加任何军事联盟或在老挝领土上建立外国军事基地；和邻国互派文化和经济代表团。关于保障公民权利的十二点协议规定寮国战斗部队的政治组织“爱国战线”享有组织、出版报纸、集会和参加竞选等等的一切便利，而不受任何歧视；规定寮国战斗部队的行政干部参加政府机构。
    为了实现这些协议，两位亲王在1956年12月28日签署了一项联合公报，规定把现在的王国政府改组为包括寮国战斗部队人员在内的联合政府。在改组政府以后，将要进行补充选举，目前有三十九名代表的国民议会将要再补选二十一名代表。增加代表名额是因为人口的增加和接受了寮国战斗部队代表团关于在老挝的历史上第一次给予妇女以选举权的要求。
    显然，这些事情是美国所不喜欢的。帝国主义者长期用来统治老挝的“分而治之”的政策已经到了破产的边缘。美国威胁说，如果老挝实行了上述的许多措施，美国就要中断“经济援助”，但是这种威胁遭到了冷遇。现在两个兄弟已经同意采取必要措施以求得国家的统一，美国大使馆就开始物色他们的新的同盟者。他们想到了流亡在泰国的年老的佩特萨拉特。难道他不愿意回来“拯救”老挝吗？是的，他是愿意回国当副国王的。一个老挝代表团曾到曼谷访问了他，了解到只有在联合政府成立后他才愿意回国。他宣布完全同意双方达成的协议。这种态度是美国所意想不到的。他们只得另找对象，于是就想到了前占巴塞王国的国王蓬温，他是亲美首相克特的妹夫。克特长期拒绝同寮国战斗部队进行谈判，最后因此而失去了首相职位。美国大使劝说蓬温废除退位书，要求重新当占巴塞王国的国王。蓬温接受了这一建议。于是，在英国人的支持下，美国人在蓬温和克特周围组成了一个反对协议和梭发那·富马政府的核心。
    克特到了美国，并参加了美国国务院主持的反共特别讲座，学习美国国务院版本的“马克思列宁主义”。这个讲座是专门为“重要”的访问者而开设的，目的是保证在几个星期内使参加者变成用“马克思列宁主义”的引语装备起来的反共专家。
    在苏发努冯离开万象回到桑怒基地去进行参加国民联合政府的最后准备工作的几天以后，克特也从美国回来，发动了一个反对寮国战斗部队和梭发那·富马政府和反对协议的猛烈的攻势。由于他失去了自己政党内大多数党员的支持，他创造了一个所谓“王国卫护者”的“影子”政党，在自己的报纸上发表“王国卫护者”的近乎呼吁的声明，号召推翻梭发那·富马政府。与克特回国的同时，美国的武器在夜间偷偷地从泰国经湄公河运进老挝，分发给为美国所收买的分子以发动武装政变。美国大使向万象的英法大使建议共同努力用合法的，或者是用“其它”的手段来推翻梭发那·富马政府。英国同意了，但法国拒绝了。法国的拒绝意味着至少用“合法”的手段是不能获得成功的。在1月份的第三个星期里，英国和美国的“反颠覆”专家开始来到万象，其中包括美国联邦调查局的人员和英国特务机关远东安全情报局的头子兰伯特上校。同时，万象麇集了泰国的“旅行者”。究竟上述这一切是为了要迫使梭发那·富马取消协议的一种压力，还是广泛谣传中的要在联合政府成立时就推翻它的阴谋的一部分，这还不清楚。不过有一点是清楚的，那就是美国和英国正费尽心机要使已达成的协议不能实现。他们公开地威胁说，如果他们所有的办法都失败了，他们要支持蓬温在南部建立一个同泰国结成联盟的分裂主义者的政权，作为进行反对老挝联合政府的活动基地。
    这些阴谋能否得逞，是很值得怀疑的。人民支持梭发那·富马的和平、统一和独立的外交政策。寮国战斗部队在全国享有巨大的威信。苏发努冯是一个深得众望的人，他得到正统派的拥戴，因为他在社会舞台上出色地完成了亲王的职责。在老挝的社会中，人们期望国王和亲王在战争时期指挥军队，并在谈判中亲自代表人民以争取和平。他得到知识分子的拥戴，因为他是受到高等教育，并在毕业时获得了学位的极少数老挝人中的一个。人民称他为人民英雄，因为他和人民同甘共苦，领导人民为民族独立事业进行了长期的武装斗争。除了克特和一小撮违背人民愿望的分子之外，没有人敢于公开地反对协议，惟恐被称为“民族叛徒”。
    在万象过了一个星期，回来时，又飞过那些连绵的紫色山岭；山顶上笼罩着白云，显得十分平静，这和老挝首都沸腾着阴谋的气氛恰成鲜明的对照。这时，人们也许能够发现在老挝的美国外交人员进行疯狂活动的关键所在了。在那些山岭的西北边是中华人民共和国的边界，东北边是越南民主共和国的边界。这两个老挝北方的省份好像是一把插入人民中国和越南民主共和国的匕首。美国曾经为了它们花了不少美元，并使得老挝人民流了滚滚的鲜血。老挝被当作东南亚条约的利刃用来刺入中国的腹部，插入越南民主共和国的侧翼。这一把刀子本来是美国企图用来在由南越、柬埔寨和泰国组成的东南亚条约集团的巩固基地上采取及时行动的。但现在柬埔寨已经拒绝参加东南亚条约，坚持中立和和平共处，这就折断了东南亚条约组织的一根台柱，给了美国的计划一个重大的打击。而去年12月28日的万象联合公报和所附的协议如果得到切实的履行，这就意味着老挝也不仅不作为一柄尖刀，相反，它向中国和越南民主共和国伸出了友谊之手，这就是对东南亚条约的致命一击。无论如何，这将是美国对世界这部分地区的政策的彻底失败。
    老挝人民和他们的领袖们已经很清楚地表示，他们愿意和邻国和平地友好地相处，决不当帝国主义战争政策的工具。但这里没有一个人低估美国政策的策划人为了挽回他们的失败所可能干出的一切活动。因此，老挝人民仍然必须提高警惕。
