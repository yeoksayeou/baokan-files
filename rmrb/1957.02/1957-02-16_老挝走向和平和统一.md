    Laos Moves Towards Peace and Unity
    By Bei Que Di, Reporter for French Newspaper "l'Humanit√©"
    As you fly from Hanoi to Vientiane, the capital of Laos, you see a continuous range of mountains covered with vegetation, so close together that it seems unlikely that humans could live among these deep valleys and steep ravines. Only as you approach the Mekong River, which flows from Tibet, do the mountains gradually descend, and the vast plains stretch out, with villages clearly visible. If the plane flies low over the ridges, you can see small patches of cultivated land cleared from the jungle on the mountaintops, and sometimes patches of cultivated land on the mountainsides, with glimpses of verdant rice paddies from the narrow gaps in the valleys. But apart from the fertile Mekong River plain, Laos is a country of densely forested, sparsely populated mountains and plateaus.
    The Kingdom of Laos covers an area of approximately 230,000 square kilometers, more than twice the combined area of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. As for the population, no one knows for sure. Official estimates range from 1.5 million to 2.5 million. Unofficial estimates are much higher. At least in recent years, the population of Laos has never been counted. Official estimates are based on the taxpayer registers of the former French colonial authorities. But it is said that the Lao people go to great lengths to avoid having their names entered in the register and conceal the true size of their families on every occasion. One of the main sources of tax revenue for the French colonialists was extorting poll taxes, from which no member of any family, from the oldest grandmother to the newborn infant, was exempt. In the mountains, whenever the tax collectors were about to arrive, the villagers simply abandoned their homes and fled deep into the jungle to establish new villages in the most difficult places to find. Even in the plains and valleys, pregnant women would avoid markets and pagodas from the moment the external signs of pregnancy appeared, to evade the tax collectors and prevent them from knowing that another victim of taxation was about to be born.
      "Divide and rule," the old maxim of imperialism, has been newly applied in this part of the world, which greatly increases the difficulty of travel. The United States' policy here is to prevent Laos and Cambodia from being "infected" by the progressive regime of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, while also trying to prevent Laos from being "infected" by the neutralist regime of Cambodia. Thus, for an ordinary traveler, a Cambodian, or a Laotian, there is no way to travel to Hanoi, nor is it possible to travel directly between the capitals of Laos and Cambodia, even though they are close neighbors and until recently belonged to the unified administrative region of French Indochina. There are air routes from Vientiane, the capital of Laos, to Saigon in South Vietnam, Bangkok in Thailand, and even Hong Kong, but there is no route to its close neighbors, Hanoi or Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. Similarly, there are air routes from Phnom Penh to Saigon and Bangkok, but not between Phnom Penh and Hanoi or Vientiane. Whenever the issue of normalizing air transport is raised, the Americans who provide transport planes to the Lao and Cambodian airlines threaten to cut off the supply of spare parts for stone and oil aircraft. The only air link between Saigon-Phnom Penh-Vientiane and Hanoi is the postal plane of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission, which only carries the Commission's staff and some journalists commissioned by the Commission. Similarly, whenever Laos and Cambodia raise the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries or establishing diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the United States threatens to cut off "economic aid" to the two countries. There is also no trade between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Cambodian or Vietnamese currency cannot be exchanged in Laos; Lao currency has no value in Cambodia.
    This policy of isolating neighbors, long practiced by the French and now used by self-proclaimed new masters of imperialism, is similarly reflected in the domestic situation in Laos. Since the Geneva Accords guaranteed the independence of Laos, the goal of American policy has always been to maintain and expand the domestic disputes in Laos, some of which have traditional foundations and some of which were created by the French. The events that have taken place in Laos over the past century, and especially in the last twelve years, are rich material for a great historical drama.
    When the French began annexing Laos in the 1880s, there were actually three independent kingdoms. The capital of one was Luang Prabang in the north; the capital of another was Vientiane in the center; and the capital of the third was Champasak in the south. The French supported the Kingdom of Luang Prabang (actually limiting the king's power to the city of Luang Prabang). The other two kingdoms were also recognized by the French, but mainly used to exert necessary pressure on the Kingdom of Luang Prabang.
    In August 1945, at the same time as uprisings broke out in Vietnam and Cambodia, an organized uprising broke out throughout Laos to seize the power that the Japanese had taken from the French a few months earlier. The insurgents declared national independence and organized armed forces to resist the French, who were supported by the British and attempted to rebuild their colonial rule. The leader of the Lao national independence movement was Prince Souphanouvong, the son of the former King of Vientiane. He was a capable engineer, a specialist in road and bridge construction. When he was studying in France, he came into contact with progressive student groups; when he was an engineer in Vietnam, he had contact with the Vietnamese revolutionary movement. Also participating in this movement was Prince Souvanna Phouma, Souphanouvong's brother. He had obtained three engineering degrees: naval engineering, electrical engineering, and civil engineering. Another brother, Prince Phetsarath, served as the honorary head of the provisional government of national independence. He was an experienced printing expert. After the death of the king, he took on the responsibilities of a father for his brothers. Under French rule, Prince Phetsarath had served as vice-king, second only to the reigning King Sisavang Vong. The independence movement was supported by the people of the whole country, but its political power was almost entirely based in some urban centers. Therefore, after launching a barbaric sweep, and carrying out cruel bombing and shelling of the cities, the French regained control of the whole country. The provisional government led the remaining armed forces to retreat to Thailand.
    Faced with the situation of nationwide unity in Laos as embodied in the uprising, the French, shortly after regaining control, made a gesture of giving Laos a constitutional unity. They "persuaded" Prince Boun Oum of Champasak, who had not participated in the uprising, to renounce his rule over the Kingdom of Champasak. As Phetsarath, the successor to the Kingdom of Vientiane, was in exile abroad, the French declared the King of Luang Prabang to be the sole ruler of a unified Laos. In order to weaken the position of the government in exile, which was recognized by the Lao people as the true government of the country, the French promulgated a constitution in Laos in May 1947, giving Laos some semblance of independence, while the French had already launched a full-scale war against the Vietnamese people. There were differences of opinion among the members of the government in exile in Thailand, which were reflected in the different decisions taken by the three brothers. Souphanouvong analyzed the reasons for their military defeat, believing that it was mainly because the resistance relied only on the cities and not on the countryside. He believed that true independence could only be won through armed struggle. He reorganized the troops loyal to the cause and returned to the jungle to organize and lead a long-term national liberation war. Souvanna Phouma believed that the French had taken steps to make Laos "independent," which provided a basis for achieving true independence through political means. He returned to Vientiane and took a seat in the French-controlled government. Phetsarath hesitated: he did not participate in the armed struggle, but he also did not accept the French's repeated invitations for him to return home as vice-king. He remained in Thailand.
    Before the Geneva armistice agreements affirmed the collapse of French colonialism in Indochina, the Lao People's Liberation Army, led by Souphanouvong, with the assistance of Vietnamese volunteers, had already liberated half of Lao territory. They played an extremely important role in preventing the French colonial army from reinforcing Dien Bien Phu through Laos.
    According to the Geneva armistice agreements, the Lao People's Liberation Army withdrew from ten provinces in central and southern Laos to the two northern provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, pending a final settlement of the Lao question through consultation, which would stipulate the legal political activities of the Lao People's Liberation Army personnel. However, after the Geneva Conference, the United States began to intervene in Lao affairs, attempting to re-ignite the civil war in Laos and undermine the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Laos. However, the Royal Army was unwilling to wage war against those who were the best patriots of Laos. In early 1956, the Lao government, which had consistently refused to negotiate and tried to eliminate the Lao People's Liberation Army, collapsed; a government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma came to power. The Phouma government guaranteed to stop the bloodshed and to conduct sincere negotiations with the Lao People's Liberation Army. American diplomats in Vientiane had tried every means to prevent these negotiations, but they failed.
    Finally, a great historical moment arrived: in July of last year, when Prince Souphanouvong, the creator and leader of the Lao People's Liberation Army, stepped out of the cabin at Vientiane Airport, his brother, Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma, stepped forward and embraced him tightly. The two brothers quickly reached an agreement on the general principles guiding the negotiations. Then began long and difficult negotiations. Whenever a concrete agreement was reached, the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane would exert pressure and make threats, which made the negotiations longer and more difficult. From November 6 to December 23, 1956, the two sides reached three separate agreements: the October 31, 1956 agreement on the cessation of hostilities, the November 2, 1956 agreement on a policy of peace and neutrality, and the December 24, 1956 agreement guaranteeing the civil rights of members of the Lao People's Liberation Army and its supporters.
    The six-point agreement on peace and neutrality stipulated that Lao foreign policy should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, establish diplomatic relations with "neighboring countries," accept economic assistance from all countries without conditions, refuse to participate in any military alliances or establish foreign military bases on Lao territory, and exchange cultural and economic delegations with neighboring countries. The twelve-point agreement on guaranteeing civil rights stipulated that the political organization of the Lao People's Liberation Army, the "Patriotic Front," should enjoy all facilities for organization, newspaper publication, assembly, and participation in elections, without any discrimination; and stipulated that administrative cadres of the Lao People's Liberation Army should participate in government agencies.
    In order to implement these agreements, the two princes signed a joint communiqu√© on December 28, 1956, stipulating that the current Royal Government should be reorganized into a coalition government including personnel from the Lao People's Liberation Army. After the reorganization of the government, supplementary elections would be held, and the National Assembly, which currently has thirty-nine representatives, would elect twenty-one more representatives. The increase in the number of representatives was due to the increase in population and the acceptance of the Lao People's Liberation Army delegation's request to grant women the right to vote for the first time in Lao history.
    Obviously, these things were not to the liking of the United States. The "divide and rule" policy that imperialists had long used to rule Laos was on the verge of bankruptcy. The United States threatened to cut off "economic aid" if Laos implemented the above-mentioned measures, but this threat was met with indifference. Now that the two brothers had agreed to take necessary measures to achieve national unity, the U.S. Embassy began to look for new allies. They thought of the elderly Phetsarath, who was in exile in Thailand. Wouldn't he be willing to return to "save" Laos? Yes, he was willing to return home as vice-king. A Lao delegation visited him in Bangkok and learned that he would only be willing to return home after the coalition government was formed. He declared that he fully agreed with the agreements reached by both sides. This attitude was unexpected by the United States. They had to look for another object, so they thought of Prince Boun Oum, the former king of Champasak, who was the brother-in-law of the pro-American Prime Minister Katay. Katay had long refused to negotiate with the Lao People's Liberation Army and eventually lost his position as prime minister because of this. The U.S. Ambassador persuaded Boun Oum to abolish his abdication and demand to be king of Champasak again. Boun Oum accepted this suggestion. Thus, with the support of the British, the Americans formed a core around Boun Oum and Katay to oppose the agreements and the Souvanna Phouma government.
    Katay went to the United States and participated in a special anti-communist lecture hosted by the U.S. State Department, where he studied the U.S. State Department's version of "Marxism-Leninism." This lecture was specifically designed for "important" visitors, with the aim of ensuring that participants would become anti-communist experts equipped with "Marxist-Leninist" quotes within a few weeks.
    A few days after Souphanouvong left Vientiane and returned to the Sam Neua base to make final preparations for participating in the National Coalition Government, Katay also returned from the United States and launched a fierce offensive against the Lao People's Liberation Army, the Souvanna Phouma government, and the agreements. Because he had lost the support of most of the members of his own party, he created a "shadow" party called the "Defenders of the Kingdom," publishing almost appeals on his newspaper, calling for the overthrow of the Souvanna Phouma government. At the same time as Katay returned home, American weapons were smuggled into Laos from Thailand across the Mekong River at night, and distributed to elements bought by the United States to launch an armed coup. The U.S. Ambassador suggested to the British and French Ambassadors in Vientiane that they jointly make efforts to overthrow the Souvanna Phouma government by legal or "other" means. The British agreed, but the French refused. The French refusal meant that at least "legal" means would not be successful. In the third week of January, British and American "anti-subversion" experts began to arrive in Vientiane, including personnel from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Colonel Lambert, the head of the Far East Security Intelligence Bureau of the British Secret Service. At the same time, Vientiane was teeming with Thai "travelers." It is not clear whether all of the above was a kind of pressure to force Souvanna Phouma to cancel the agreements, or part of a widely rumored conspiracy to overthrow it when the coalition government was established. However, one thing is clear, the United States and Britain are racking their brains to prevent the agreements that have been reached from being implemented. They openly threatened that if all their methods failed, they would support Boun Oum in establishing a separatist regime in the south allied with Thailand, as a base for carrying out activities against the Lao coalition government.
    Whether these conspiracies can succeed is highly doubtful. The people support Souvanna Phouma's foreign policy of peace, unity, and independence. The Lao People's Liberation Army enjoys great prestige throughout the country. Souphanouvong is a popular figure, who is supported by the Orthodox because he has excellently fulfilled the duties of a prince on the social stage. In Lao society, people expect kings and princes to command armies in times of war and to personally represent the people in negotiations to strive for peace. He is supported by intellectuals because he is one of the very few Lao people who have received higher education and obtained degrees upon graduation. The people call him a people's hero because he has shared weal and woe with the people and led the people in a long-term armed struggle for national independence. Apart from Katay and a small handful of elements who go against the will of the people, no one dares to openly oppose the agreements, for fear of being called a "national traitor."
    After spending a week in Vientiane, and returning, flying over those continuous purple mountain ranges again; the mountaintops were shrouded in white clouds, appearing very peaceful, which was in stark contrast to the atmosphere of conspiracy seething in the Lao capital. At this time, one may be able to discover the key to the frenzied activities of the American diplomats in Laos. On the northwest side of those mountains is the border of the People's Republic of China, and on the northeast side is the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These two northern provinces of Laos seem to be a dagger inserted into the People's China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The United States has spent a lot of dollars on them and has made the Lao people shed rivers of blood. Laos has been used as the sharp edge of the Southeast Asia Treaty to stab into China's abdomen and insert into the flank of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This knife was originally an attempt by the United States to take timely action on the consolidated base of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization consisting of South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. But now Cambodia has refused to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty, insisting on neutrality and peaceful coexistence, which has broken a pillar of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and given the United States' plan a major blow. If the Vientiane joint communiqu√© of December 28 of last year and the attached agreements are effectively implemented, this means that Laos will not only not act as a sharp knife, but on the contrary, it will extend a hand of friendship to China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is a fatal blow to the Southeast Asia Treaty. In any case, this would be a complete failure of American policy in this part of the world.
    The Lao people and their leaders have clearly expressed that they are willing to live in peace and friendship with their neighbors, and will never be tools of imperialist war policies. But no one here underestimates the activities that the planners of American policy may carry out to reverse their defeat. Therefore, the Lao people must remain vigilant.
