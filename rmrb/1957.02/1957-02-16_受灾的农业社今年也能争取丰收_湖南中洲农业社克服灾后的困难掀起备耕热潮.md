    This newspaper reports: Agricultural production cooperatives that suffered production cuts due to disasters last year, have weak work foundations, and are insufficiently prepared for spring plowing, can still strive for a bumper harvest this year, provided they fully strengthen organizational and ideological leadership, solve practical difficulties, improve labor organization, and mobilize members to urgently prepare for plowing. The Zhongzhou Agricultural Cooperative in Gangkou Township, Yueyang County, Hunan Province, has made remarkable achievements in this regard.
    The Zhongzhou Agricultural Cooperative was formed in August last year by merging four elementary cooperatives into an advanced cooperative. The core strength of the cooperative is weak, and it suffered a severe drought last year, resulting in reduced production. The spring plowing preparations at the beginning of this year were very lax. By the end of mid-January this year, the cooperative's spring plowing work was still not up to par with the same period last year. Whether in terms of fertilizer, water conservancy, draft animals, farm tools, or production funds, it did not meet this year's production requirements. Therefore, if this year's production was carried out based on the spring plowing strength at the end of January, it would not only fail to increase production but would also be reduced by 30% compared to 1955.
    In order to quickly reverse this situation, the Zhongzhou Agricultural Cooperative vigorously carried out rectification and socialist propaganda work, while also solving some practical difficulties for the members. Subsequently, the Zhongzhou Agricultural Cooperative mobilized its members to calculate five sets of accounts and tapped the potential for increased production. As a result, it was discovered that as long as the entire cooperative caught up quickly and worked hard to prepare for plowing, there were still conditions to strive for a bumper harvest this year. At present, the negative emotions of the members have been eliminated, and the paralysis in production throughout the cooperative has also changed. A spring plowing upsurge has been set off in the cooperative. The Zhongzhou Cooperative has already put forward this year's production increase plan: rice production will increase by 22.4% compared to 1955, and total agricultural income will increase by 23.5% compared to 1955.
    After calculating the five sets of accounts, the Zhongzhou Agricultural Cooperative found the basis for achieving the production increase plan as follows:
    First, this year, the cadres have accumulated some experience in leading production, and the vast majority of members have the desire to increase production. Last year, sixty-one cooperative cadres did not know how to lead collective production, and many members still had some doubts about the agricultural cooperative. This year, out of the seventy-three cooperative and team cadres in the cooperative, sixty-nine have learned the experience of contracting work quotas, labor management, and other aspects of leading production. Among the two hundred and seventy-eight member households in the cooperative, one hundred and fifty-two poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants are actively demanding to run the cooperative well and increase production. According to the investigation of three teams, eight out of fourteen new and old upper-middle peasant households also demanded to run the cooperative well and increase production. Most members have realized that only by striving to work more and striving for increased production in the cooperative can they increase their income.
    Second, the labor potential is very large. Last year, some members, especially the upper-middle peasants, had doubts about the agricultural cooperative and were not active in working. The forty-three upper-middle peasant households in the cooperative did a total of one thousand six hundred and twenty fewer workdays throughout the year. Some of the female laborers and semi-laborers in the cooperative did not work regularly last year, for a total of three thousand fewer workdays. Last year, fifty-six households in the cooperative did one thousand and sixty fewer workdays due to living difficulties. Due to the chaotic labor management and unreasonable work point recording methods last year, the two hundred and sixty-eight male and female laborers who frequently worked were delayed by three thousand nine hundred and sixty workdays. In total, the cooperative did nine thousand six hundred and forty fewer workdays last year. This year, the members, including the upper-middle peasants, have mostly eliminated their doubts about running the cooperative, the living problems of the households in difficulty have been properly arranged, labor management has been improved, and labor quotas and remuneration standards have been revised and supplemented. The manpower invested in agricultural production this year can be increased by at least seven thousand seven hundred more than last year, and the labor efficiency of the members has also been greatly improved. According to calculations, the investment of these seven thousand seven hundred more workdays with improved efficiency in agricultural production can guarantee that all one thousand two hundred and fifty-one mu of farmland in the cooperative will be ploughed three times and harrowed six times, and the grass will be trampled three times, achieving intensive cultivation.
    Third, the land potential is large, and there are many sideline occupations. Last year, the total replanting area of the cooperative was only six hundred and eighty-five mu. This year, late rice alone can be planted on six hundred and fifty mu, plus the replanting area of autumn buckwheat, mud beans, early sweet potatoes, etc., for a total of one thousand two hundred and fifteen mu, an increase of nearly one-fold compared to last year. After the state opened up the free market, there are more sideline occupations than last year, and it is estimated that income can increase by more than six times compared to last year.
    Fourth, after the entire cooperative strengthened the organizational leadership of spring plowing preparation work, the material preparation for spring plowing production has become more certain. At this time last year, the seeds had not yet been collected, but this year, not only are the seeds sufficient, but they are also mostly improved varieties. For example, there are already five thousand four hundred and thirty-one catties of early rice seeds and three thousand two hundred catties of late rice seeds. After the cooperative formulated a system for managing and protecting draft cattle and strengthened the protection and maintenance, the existing draft cattle have improved their cultivation ability. At the same time, the cooperative plans to carry out spring ploughing early on ninety-four mu of hardpan fields to avoid the strain on cattle power during spring ploughing. In this way, the problem of cattle shortage can be completely solved. In terms of fertilizer, twelve sources of fertilizer have been found, which can accumulate about 100,000 dan of fertilizer, plus the existing 80,000 dan, which is only more than 8,000 dan less than the fertilizer planned for use this year. By opening up more fertilizer sources and buying some commercial fertilizer, the needs for this year's production increase can be met. The cooperative organized four carpenters to repair farm tools, and now there is absolutely no shortage of spring ploughing farm tools. In terms of production funds, a total of more than 6,500 yuan of agricultural production funds and living funds are still needed in the first half of this year, which can be raised from member investment, sideline income, spring harvest crop income, and member savings.
    Fifth, from January 24th to Qingming Festival, it is estimated that there are seventy-five working days. During this period, cultivating spring harvest crops, accumulating fertilizer, repairing water conservancy, ploughing fields, repairing roads, etc., will require a total of nine thousand three hundred and seventy-five workdays. The male and female labor force of the cooperative can do a total of eleven thousand five hundred and eighty workdays, which can completely make all the work meticulous and appropriate.
    After this series of work, the cooperative cadres and members of the Zhongzhou Agricultural Cooperative were full of confidence and energy. The number of members participating in collective production has increased from the original seven to one hundred and forty-seven. During and after the Spring Festival, the members did not slacken their efforts, braved the wind and snow, insisted on working, and launched a heated labor competition. In the days after the Spring Festival, they completely eliminated the hardpan fields, applied fertilizer to seven hundred and twenty-one mu of spring harvest crops, and accumulated fertilizer equivalent to more than one-third of that since last winter, increasing the average fertilizer per mu from twenty-six dan to nearly thirty-six dan. Three of the five water conservancy projects have also been repaired. According to the estimate of the Zhongzhou Agricultural Cooperative Committee, as long as the entire cooperative continues to work hard and does not encounter major natural disasters, it is entirely possible to achieve this year's production increase plan.

### 受灾的农业社今年也能争取丰收  湖南中洲农业社克服灾后的困难掀起备耕热潮

    受灾的农业社今年也能争取丰收
    湖南中洲农业社克服灾后的困难掀起备耕热潮
    本报讯　去年受灾减产、工作基础薄弱、春耕准备不足的农业生产合作社，只要全力加强组织领导和思想领导，解决实际困难，改善劳动组织，多方挖掘潜力，发动社员急起备耕，就有条件争取今年丰收。湖南省岳阳县筻口乡中洲农业社在这方面作出了显著成绩。
    中洲农业社是去年8月间由四个初级社合并组成的高级社。社的骨干力量薄弱，去年又因为受了严重旱灾而减产，年初的备耕工作很松懈。到今年1月中旬末，这个社的备耕工作还赶不上去年同时期的成绩，无论在肥料、水利、耕畜、农具和生产资金等方面，都没有达到今年的生产要求。因此，如果按照1月底时的备耕力量来进行今年的生产，不但不能增产，而且会比1955年减产30％。
    为了迅速扭转这种情况，中洲农业社大力进行了整社和社会主义宣传工作，同时解决了社员的某些实际困难。接着，中洲农业社发动社员算了五笔账，并且挖掘了增产潜力。结果，发现只要全社急起直追，努力备耕，今年还有条件争取丰收。目前，社员们的消极情绪已经打消了，全社在生产方面的瘫痪状态也改变了。社里掀起了一个备耕热潮。中洲社已经提出了今年的增产计划：稻谷比1955年增产22.4％，农业总收入比1955年增加23.5％。
    中洲农业社算过五笔账以后，找到了实现增产计划的根据如下：
    一、今年，干部已经积累了一些领导生产的经验，绝大部分社员都有增加生产的要求。去年，六十一个社干部都不懂得如何领导集体生产，不少社员对农业社还有些疑虑。今年，全社七十三个社队干部，有六十九人学会了包工定额、劳动管理等领导生产的经验。全社二百七十八户社员中，一百五十二户贫农和新、老下中农都积极要求办好社，增加生产。据三个队的调查，十四户新、老上中农之中也有八户要求办好社，增加生产。大多数社员都认识到只有争取多出工，争取社里增产，自己才能增加收入。
    二、劳动力潜力很大。去年，有部分社员，特别是上中农，对农业社有疑虑，出工不积极，全社四十三户上中农全年少做了一千六百二十个工。全社的女劳动力和半劳动力，去年有些人不经常出工，总计共少做了三千个工。去年全社有五十六户因生活困难而少做了一千零六十个工。由于去年的劳动管理混乱和记工方法不合理，经常出工的二百六十八个男女劳动力耽误了三千九百六十个工。总计起来，去年全社共少做了九千六百四十个工。今年，社员们、包括上中农在内，对办合作社的疑虑大都消除了，困难户的生活问题得到了妥善的安排，劳动管理搞好了，还修订、补订了劳动定额和报酬标准。今年投入农业生产的人工至少可以比去年增加七千七百多个，而且社员们的劳动效率也大大提高了。据计算，这七千七百多个提高了效率的人工投入农业生产，就能够保证全社一千二百五十一亩田地都做到三犁六耙，并且踩草三次，做到精耕细作。
    三、土地潜力大，副业门路多。去年，全社复种面积共只六百八十五亩，今年光晚稻就可以种六百五十亩，加上秋荞、泥豆、早红薯等的复种面积，共有一千二百一十五亩，比去年增加将近一倍。国家开放自由市场以后，副业门路比去年多，估计收入可以比去年增加六倍多。
    四、全社加强备耕的组织领导工作以后，春耕生产的物资准备已经有了把握。去年这时种子还没有筹齐，今年种子不仅足，而且大都是良种。如早稻种子已有五千四百三十一斤，晚稻种子已有三千二百斤。社里制定耕牛管理护养制度和加强护养以后，现有耕牛提高了耕作能力；同时社里计划把九十四亩板田提早春耕，避免春耕时牛力紧张。这样，缺牛问题完全可以解决。在肥料方面，已经找到了十二种肥源，可以积肥约十万担，加上现有的八万多担，比今年计划施用的肥料只少八千多担，再增辟肥料和买一点商品肥料，就可以满足今年增产的需要。社里组织了四个木匠整修农具，现在春耕农具已经完全不缺。在生产资金方面，今年上半年还需要农业生产资金和生活资金共六千五百多元，可以从社员投资、副业收入、春收作物收入和社员节约等方面来筹足。
    五、从1月24日到清明，预计有七十五个工作日，这段期间培育春收作物、积肥、修水利、犁田、修路等共需九千三百七十五个工，全社男、女劳动力共能做一万一千五百八十个工，完全可以把各项工作做得细致妥贴。
    经过了这一系列工作以后，中洲农业社的社干部和社员信心百倍，劲头十足。参加集体生产的社员，由原来的七人增加到一百四十七人。春节前后，社员们毫不松劲，冒风踏雪，坚持出工，展开了火热的劳动竞赛。春节过后的几天中，他们全部消灭了板田，在七百二十一亩春收作物田中追了肥，积的肥料相当于去年冬季以来的三分之一以上，使平均每亩田的肥料由二十六担增加到了将近三十六担；五处水利工程也修好了三处。据中洲农业社社委会估计，只要全社继续努力，又不遭遇重大天灾，完全可能实现今年的增产计划。　（据新湖南日报讯）
