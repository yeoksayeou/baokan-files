    The Indian Economy After World War II
    Yu Mingren
    After about two hundred years of British colonial rule, India regained its independence in August 1947. On January 26, 1950, the Republic of India was proclaimed, and the most brilliant jewel in the British crown was removed.
    British rule had caused extremely serious economic consequences for India. Historically, India was one of the earliest countries in the world to develop materially and spiritually. It possessed superior natural conditions and abundant mineral resources. However, the relentless exploitation by British colonialists had long hindered the development of social productive forces in India. India had become a poor and backward country.
    The Indian economy was backward after independence. The total output value of modern industry accounted for only 6.5% of the national income, and the industrial population accounted for only a tiny minority of the total national population. In terms of industrial structure, light industry held an absolute advantage, with the textile industry accounting for about half of the total industrial output value. In terms of heavy industry, apart from a few sectors such as steel and mining, the others were negligible. Machine manufacturing was out of the question. Even calculating steel production per capita, India was only one-eightieth of that of Britain and one-one hundred fortieth of that of the United States. The rural population of India accounted for more than 80% of the total national population, and the population engaged in agriculture accounted for 70% of the total national population. Agricultural production was carried out in extremely small units, and even today most areas still use ancient agricultural production tools, so the yield per unit area of agricultural products is very low. In the initial years after independence, India needed to import large quantities of grain every year, and even then, it could not save the vast impoverished class from starvation.
    After the founding of the Republic of India, the Indian government and people devoted themselves to the development of the national economy. In order to get rid of backwardness and poverty, the Indian government formulated and implemented the First Five-Year Plan, and began to formulate and implement the Second Five-Year Plan, proposing the realization of industrialization as the task of economic construction. In recent years, India's economic construction has made some good achievements. In agriculture, due to the implementation of some technical improvements, especially the expansion of irrigated area, as well as suitable climate and rainfall in recent years, agricultural production has increased to a certain extent. Among them, the production of grain and cotton exceeded and completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. There has also been a large increase in industrial production. If the industrial production volume in 1946 is taken as one hundred, then it was one hundred and five in 1950 and one hundred and fifty-nine in 1955. From 1950 to 1955, pig iron production increased from 1.5 million tons to 1.9 million tons, steel production increased from 1 million tons to 1.3 million tons, coal mining increased from 32 million tons to 38 million tons, and electricity production increased from 5.1 billion kilowatt-hours to 8 billion kilowatt-hours.
    In terms of economic structure, the current Indian economy is mainly composed of foreign enterprises, feudalist economy, and national capital. Although there have been slight changes in the proportions of these economic components in the past few years, the basic situation has remained unchanged.
    Long-term colonial rule has given foreign capital a dominant position in the Indian economy, mainly British capital. According to statistics from June 1948, foreign capital in India, calculated at face value, reached 3.2 billion rupees, accounting for 45% of the total investment in Indian industry and commerce. If we look at the various economic sectors separately, in 1951 foreign capital controlled 97% of the petroleum industry, 93% of the rubber industry, 90% of the match industry, 89% of the jute industry, 62% of coal mines, 43% of the power industry, and 21% of the textile industry. Foreign capital extracts huge profits from India every year. Part of it is remitted back to the home country, and part is used as additional investment. At the same time, some capital still flowed into India after the war. Therefore, the total amount of foreign investment in India continues to increase. From June 1948 to December 1953, long-term investment alone increased by more than 1.3 billion rupees, bringing its total face value to 4.19 billion rupees. The control of the Indian economy by imperialist enterprises is not only reflected in the proportion of investment, but also in the control of Indian private capital. Foreign capital controls Indian capital that cooperates with it, and controls many Indian companies through managing agency systems and foreign trade.
    For the benefit of national economic development, the Indian government has implemented some measures to restrict and weaken foreign capital in the post-war period. The Indian government's 1948 Industrial Policy Resolution and the 1956 New Industrial Policy Resolution stipulate that many of the most important industrial sectors must be operated by state capital, which has played a certain restrictive role for both domestic private capital and foreign capital. Since 1955, the Indian government has implemented a series of nationalization measures, nationalizing enterprises controlled by foreign capital such as the Imperial Bank, life insurance businesses, and Kolar gold mines through compensation, which has played a significant role in weakening the influence of foreign capital on the Indian economy. However, despite the implementation of the above measures, the main positions of foreign capital in the Indian economy have not been shaken.
    In rural India, feudalist relations of production occupy a dominant position. There are various forms of landlord system in India, including the so-called Zamindar, Inamdar, Jagirdar, Malguzar, etc. Some of them are old Indian systems, and some were cultivated during British rule in India. They ruthlessly suck the blood of the peasants. The land distribution in India is extremely unreasonable. The poor, hired, middle peasants and other people, who account for 85% of the rural population, only occupy 15% of the land, while the landlords and rich peasants, who account for only 15% of the rural population, occupy 85% of the country's land. Under this extremely unreasonable land distribution, the vast majority of peasant masses have to rent land from landlords and pay them large amounts of rent every year. According to the 1949 report of the Congress Party Land Reform Committee, the rent in kind paid by Indian peasants generally accounted for 50% of the total harvest, and in some areas it reached 75% of the total harvest. Under this feudal system and the exploitation of commercial and usurious capital, many Indian peasants live in extreme poverty.
    The Indian government after independence has taken some measures to weaken the feudal system in order to establish a better land management system. The Indian government's land reform plan is to stipulate the maximum limit of land holdings, take over land from landlords by giving compensation, and then sell the land to laboring peasants by the government. At the same time, in 1951, a land donation movement was launched, hoping that landlords would donate their land to landless peasants themselves. However, as the draft of the Second Five-Year Plan pointed out, "The provisions of the Land Reform Law have not been fully realized as hoped, due to the lack of enthusiasm of the administrative agencies and the weakness of rural organizations." Because of the long-term talk about the maximum land limit but the failure to implement it, landlords have time to disperse land by various means and drive tenant farmers off the land. At the same time, according to the announcement by the Indian government in the second half of 1955, although the government has taken over 160 million acres of land, only 7% of the wealthier class of peasants can actually afford to buy land. Therefore, until now, the vast majority of peasants still need to rent land from landlords or sub-landlords. Moreover, some landlords who have been abolished still carry out semi-feudal exploitation of the vast landless hired laborers because they have obtained huge compensation and retained a large amount of private land. Therefore, although feudal relations in rural India have been weakened to some extent in the past few years, such as the abolition of the Zamindar, Jagirdar and other landlord systems in some provinces, thereby canceling some illegal extortions and compulsory rights of landlords against peasants, and some provisions have also been made in some provinces and states to reduce the land rent rate, stipulating that the land rent does not exceed one-quarter or one-third of the total harvest (which has not been effectively implemented), the foundation of feudal exploitation has not been shaken, and the landlord class still occupies a dominant position in the rural economy and politics. Because some feudal landlords are gradually transforming into capitalist landlords, and the economy of rich peasants and tenant farmers is expanding, the movement of the rural economy in India is advancing in the direction of capitalism.
    The generation of national capital in India has a history of more than 100 years, but its development has been very slow under the oppression of British imperialism. Until the establishment of the Republic of India, national capital only accounted for a small part of the entire national economy. They are mainly concentrated in light industrial sectors, such as cotton weaving, sugar making, paper, food, etc., and many are small-scale industries and household industries. In terms of heavy industry, only steel and cement account for a larger proportion. At present, there are two forms of national capital in India. One is private capital enterprises, which originally existed and have been further developed after independence. The other is state capitalist enterprises, which were created after the establishment of the Republic of India. On the one hand, the Indian government has turned some banks, insurance businesses, shipping companies, gold mines, etc. into public sectors of the national economy through nationalization. On the other hand, in the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, it has established a number of new state-owned enterprises, including locomotive factories, carriage factories, shipyards, mineral fertilizer factories, machine tool factories, precision machine factories, cable factories, oil processing plants, and so on. At the same time, it has also established a number of large hydropower stations in various places and established the State Trading Corporation.
    Compared with the two, state capital and private capital, private capital occupies an absolute advantage. The total output value of Indian government enterprises is less than 3% of the national income. If we put aside agriculture and other labor services, government enterprises account for 11% of mining, transportation, processing, and commerce. Indian government officials have repeatedly pointed out that the public and private sectors should develop together and gradually give the public sector a dominant position. However, judging from the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan and the formulation of the Second Five-Year Plan, the public sector can only be in a secondary position in the near future. For example, in the industrial and mining investment of the First Five-Year Plan, government investment was only 1.73 billion rupees, of which investment in modern industry and mining was only 1.49 billion rupees. The investment of the private sector in industry is expected to be 3.83 billion rupees. In the draft of the Second Five-Year Plan, the industrial and mining investment of the public sector is 8.9 billion rupees, of which 6.9 billion rupees are invested in modern industry and mining. The private sector is stipulated to be 5.6 billion rupees.
    In addition to the above three main economic components, there are also a large number of handicraftsmen and self-cultivating farmers in India. The status of these small commodity producers is unstable, and they are in a process of constant differentiation.
    Among these various economic components, national capital, especially the national capital of the public sector, is currently a more progressive economic form in India, and it can also promote the development of social productive forces in India. The measures taken by the Indian government are to gradually weaken the economic forces of imperialism and feudalism, and develop a national capitalist economy, especially a state capitalist economy. These measures are of progressive significance. The Indian economy is today developing in the direction of a national independent economy. There are many obstacles and difficulties on this path of economic development, but the Indian people can overcome difficulties and move forward.

    第二次世界大战后的印度经济
    俞明仁
    经过英国约二百年的殖民统治，印度于1947年8月重新恢复了独立。1950年1月26日印度共和国宣告成立，英王皇冠上最灿烂的宝石被摘掉了。
    英国的统治给印度造成了极其严重的经济恶果。印度在历史上曾经是全世界物质文明和精神文明最早发达的国家之一。它拥有着优越的自然条件和丰富的矿产资源。但是英国殖民者敲骨吸髓的压榨，长期以来阻碍了印度社会生产力的发展。印度变成了一个贫穷和落后的国家。
    独立后的印度经济是落后的。现代工业的总产值只占国民收入的6.5％，工业人口也只占全国总人口中的极少数。而在工业的结构上，轻工业占着绝对的优势，其中纺织工业大约就占工业总产值的一半左右。在重工业方面除了钢铁、采矿等几个部门之外，其他都是微乎其微。机器制造业是根本谈不上的。而且就以钢的产量按人口平均计算，印度只及英国的八十分之一，美国的一百四十分之一。印度的农村人口占了全国总人口的80％以上，从事农业的人口占了全国总人口的70％。农业生产是分为极其细小的单位来进行的，直到今天大部分地区仍然使用着古老的农业生产工具，因此农产品的单位面积产量很低。在独立后的最初几年间，印度每年都需要大量的粮食进口，而且还不能使广大的贫苦阶层免于饥饿。
    印度共和国成立以后，印度的政府和人民曾经致力于国民经济的发展。为了摆脱落后和贫困，印度政府制定并执行了第一个五年计划，并且着手制定和实行第二个五年计划，提出实现工业化作为经济建设的任务。几年来印度的经济建设取得了一些良好的成绩。在农业方面由于实行了一些技术改良，特别是扩大了灌溉面积，以及连年来的气候雨量适宜，农业生产有了一定的增加。其中粮食和棉花的生产都超额提前完成了第一个五年计划。在工业生产方面也有了很大的增长。如果以1946年的工业生产量为一百，则1950年为一百零五，1955年为一百五十九。从1950年到1955年，生铁产量由一百五十万吨增加到一百九十万吨，钢的产量由一百万吨增加到一百三十万吨，煤的开采量由三千二百万吨增加到三千八百万吨，电力生产由五十一亿瓩小时增加到八十亿瓩小时。
    在经济结构上，目前印度的经济主要是由外国企业、封建主义经济和民族资本三个部分构成的。战后几年来的发展，这几种经济成份虽然在比重上略微有些变化，而基本的情况仍然是没有变动的。
    长期以来的殖民地统治使外国资本在印度经济中占据了支配的地位，其中主要是英国的资本。根据1948年6月的统计，在印度的外国资本按票面价值计算达三十二亿卢比，占印度工商业投资总额的45％。如果分别从各个经济部门来看，1951年外国资本控制了石油工业的97％，橡胶工业的93％，火柴工业的90％，黄麻工业的89％，煤矿的62％，电力工业的43％，纺织工业的21％。外国资本每年从印度榨取到庞大的利润。其中一部分被汇回本国，一部分作为追加的投资。同时战后仍有一部分资本流入印度。所以在印度的外国投资总额继续地增加。从1948年6月到1953年12月，单以长期投资来说就增加了十三亿卢比以上，而使它的票面价值总数达到四十一亿九千万卢比。帝国主义企业对印度经济的控制不仅表现在投资所占的比重方面，而且还表现在对印度私人资本的控制方面。外国资本控制着同它合作的印度资本，并且通过经理行制度和对外贸易控制了许多印度的公司。
    为了民族经济发展的利益，战后时期印度政府曾经实行过一些限制和削弱外国资本的措施。印度政府1948年的工业政策决议以及1956年的新工业政策决议中，规定了许多最重要的工业部门必须由国家资本来经营，这无论对本国的私人资本和对外国资本说来都起了一定的限制作用。自1955年以来，印度政府实行一系列的国有化的措施，通过给予补偿的办法将帝国银行、人寿保险事业、科拉尔金矿等受外国资本控制的企业收归国有，这对于削弱外国资本对印度经济的影响起了很大的作用。但是尽管实行了上述的措施，外国资本在印度经济中的主要阵地并未动摇。
    在印度的农村中封建主义的生产关系占着统治地位。印度存在着形形色色的地主制度，有所谓柴明达、印南达、加吉达、马尔古查等等。其中有些是印度旧有的，有的是英国统治印度期间所培植起来的，他们都无情地吮吸着农民的脂膏。印度的土地分配是极不合理的，占农村人口的85％的贫、雇、中农及其他人民，只占有了15％的土地，而全国土地的85％却被仅占农村人口15％的地主富农所占有。在这种土地分配极不合理的情况下，广大农民群众不得不向地主租种土地，而每年向他缴纳大量的地租。根据1949年国大党土地改革委员会的报告，印度农民所缴纳的实物地租一般占总收获量的50％，而有些地区则达到总收获量的75％。在这种封建制度以及商业资本和高利贷资本的剥削下，印度许多农民过着极贫困的生活。
    独立后的印度政府曾经采取了一些措施来削弱封建制度，以便建立一种较好的土地经营制度。印度政府的土地改革计划是规定土地持有的最高限额，用给予赔偿的方式从地主手中接管土地，然后再由政府将土地出卖给劳动农民。同时1951年还发起了一个捐田运动，希望地主自己把土地捐献出来分给无地的农民。但是，正如第二个五年计划草案所指出的，“土地改革法的规定并没有如所希望那样的得到完全实现，这是因为行政机构的缺乏积极性和农村组织的软弱无力。”由于长期谈论着土地最高限额而迟迟不能实行，使得地主有时间用种种办法分散土地，并且把租佃的农民从土地上赶走。同时，根据印度政府1955年下半年宣布，虽然政府业已接管了一亿六千万英亩的土地，但是真正购买得起土地的只占农民的7％的富裕阶层。因此，直到现在，绝大部分的农民仍需向地主或二地主租种土地。而且，某些被废除了的地主由于获得了巨额的补偿金和保留了大量的私有地，仍然对广大的无地雇农进行半封建的剥削。所以，战后几年来印度农村中的封建关系虽然有了一些削弱，如在某些省份中废除了柴明达、加吉达等地主制度，从而取消了地主对农民的某些非法勒索和强迫的权利。而且在某些省邦中也曾作了一些减轻地租率的规定，规定地租不超过总收获量的四分之一或三分之一（实际上并未切实地执行）。但是封建剥削的根基并没有动摇，地主阶级在农村的经济和政治上都还居于统治地位。由于某些封建地主逐渐转变为资本主义地主，同时富农和租地农业家的经济正在扩大，所以印度农村经济的运动乃是朝着资本主义的方向前进的。
    印度民族资本的产生已经有一百多年的历史，但是在英帝国主义的压抑下它的发展是很缓慢的。直到印度共和国的成立，民族资本在整个国民经济中只占一个不大的部分。它们主要集中在轻工业部门，如棉织、制糖、纸张、食品等等，而且很多是小规模的工业和家庭工业。在重工业方面，只有在钢铁、水泥上占有了较大的比重。目前印度的民族资本存在着两种形式，一种是私人资本的企业，这是原来就有的而在独立以后又获得了进一步的发展。另一种是国家资本主义的企业，这是印度共和国成立以后才产生的。印度政府一方面通过国有化的办法将某些银行、保险事业、船运公司、金矿等变为国民经济中的公营部分。另一方面，在五年计划的实施中又建立了一批新的公营企业，其中有机车制造厂、车厢制造厂、造船厂、矿质肥料厂、机床制造厂、精密机器制造厂、电缆制造厂、石油加工厂等等。同时还在各地建立了一批大的水电站，并且成立了国家贸易公司。
    目前国家资本和私人资本二者比较起来，私人资本占着绝对的优势，印度政府企业总产值还不到国民收入的3％。如果撇开农业和其他劳务，则政府企业在采矿、运输、加工、商业等方面占11％。印度政府负责人一再指出公营部分和私营部分要协同地向前发展，而使公营部分在其中逐渐取得优势地位。不过从第一个五年计划的执行和第二个五年计划的制定上看来，公营部分在最近的将来仍然只能处于次要的地位。例如在第一个五年计划的工矿业投资中，政府投资只有十七亿三千万卢比，其中用于现代工矿业的投资又只有十四亿九千万卢比。而私营部分对工业的投资预计是三十八亿三千万卢比。在第二个五年计划的草案中，公营部分的工矿业投资是八十九亿卢比，其中投于现代工矿业的是六十九亿卢比。而私营部分则是规定为五十六亿卢比。
    除了上述三种主要的经济成份以外，在印度还存在着大量的手工业者和自耕农。这种小商品生产者的地位是不稳定的，它们处在时刻分化的过程中。
    在这各种经济成份中，民族资本、特别是公营部分的民族资本是目前印度较进步的经济形式，它还能够促进印度社会生产力的发展。印度政府所采取的措施是逐渐削弱帝国主义和封建主义的经济势力，发展民族资本主义经济，特别是国家资本主义经济，这种措施是有进步意义的。印度的经济今天正朝着民族独立经济的方向发展，在这条经济发展道路上有着许多的障碍和困难，但印度人民能够克服困难而前进。
