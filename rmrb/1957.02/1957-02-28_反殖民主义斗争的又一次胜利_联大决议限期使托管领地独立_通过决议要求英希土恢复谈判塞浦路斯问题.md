Xinhua News Agency, February 27th Dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly adopted several resolutions from the Trusteeship Council on the 26th, including one that requests Britain, France, Belgium, and Australia to set dates for the trust territories currently under their administration to achieve autonomy or independence. This resolution was passed with 44 votes in favor, 14 votes against, and 17 abstentions. Due to opposition from Western countries, a sentence in the original proposal was removed, which stated that the United Nations was convinced that "most trust territories are capable of exercising autonomy or independence in the near future."

The General Assembly also passed another resolution with 47 votes in favor, 15 votes against, and 11 abstentions, recommending that Britain "consider issuing a statement outlining the policies it plans to implement in Tanganyika," and specifically state that it will guide the territory towards self-determination or enable it to achieve independence as a "democratic country where all residents enjoy equal rights."

British Minister of State Allan Noble spoke against the resolution concerning the future of Tanganyika. Representatives from Britain, Australia, and France all opposed the resolution requiring the setting of dates for trust territories to achieve autonomy or independence.

Soviet representative Tarabayev, who worked in the Trusteeship Council to pass the aforementioned proposals, refuted their arguments, stating that a timetable was necessary because progress in the territories was too slow and that the administering powers were using every means to maintain colonial policies.

The General Assembly also passed the Trusteeship Council's resolution to continue demanding that the Union of South Africa place South West Africa under UN trusteeship and to request the UN Secretary-General to find a way to make the Union of South Africa accept this demand.

On this day, the General Assembly also decided to postpone consideration of the issue of increasing the number of non-permanent members of the Security Council, as well as expanding the membership of the Economic and Social Council and the International Court of Justice, to the next session.

Xinhua News Agency, February 27th Dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session on the 26th adopted the recommendation of the Political Committee, calling on Britain, Greece, and Turkey to resume negotiations on the Cyprus issue and to find a peaceful, democratic, and just solution based on the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.

The result of the vote was: 55 votes in favor, none against, and one abstention (Afghanistan).

    反殖民主义斗争的又一次胜利
    联大决议限期使托管领地独立
    通过决议要求英希土恢复谈判塞浦路斯问题
    据新华社27日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会26日通过了托管委员会的一些决议，其中有一项要求英国、法国、比利时和澳大利亚规定使目前由它们管辖的托管地获得自治或者独立的日期。这项决议以四十四票对十四票、十七票弃权获得通过。由于西方国家的反对，原提案中的一句话被删去了，这一句话说，联合国确信“大多数托管地区都有能力在今后不久实行自治或者独立”。
    大会还以四十七票对十五票、十一票弃权通过了另外一项决议，建议英国“考虑发表声明，说明它计划在坦噶尼喀执行的政策”，并且具体地声明它将要引导这个领地走向自决，或者使它获得独立而成为“全国居民都享受平等权利的民主国家”。
    英国国务大臣阿兰·诺布尔在发言中反对关于坦噶尼喀前途问题的决议。英国、澳大利亚和法国的代表都反对要求规定使托管领地获得自治或独立的日期的决议。
    在托管委员会中努力使上述提案获得通过的苏联代表塔日巴耶夫驳斥了他们的论点，他说，必须有时间表，因为各领地的进步过于迟缓，而且，宗主国为了维护殖民主义政策，使用了一切的方法。
    大会还通过了托管委员会关于继续要求南非联邦把西南非交给联合国托管和请联合国秘书长设法使南非联邦接受这一要求的决议。
    大会在这一天还决定把增加安全理事会非常任理事国问题以及扩大经济及社会理事会和国际法院的成员国问题移交下届会议考虑。
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议26日通过了政治委员会的建议，要求英国、希腊、土耳其三国恢复关于塞浦路斯问题的谈判，并且根据联合国宪章的原则和宗旨找到一个和平、民主和公正的解决办法。
    表决的结果是：五十五票赞成，没有人反对，一票弃权（阿富汗）。
