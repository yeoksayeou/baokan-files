    Caring for Pioneers Away from Home
    Kong Sang
    In recent years, a large number of employees have left their hometowns to participate in construction in the interior. They are glorious, and they bear significant responsibilities. However, some of their families left behind in their hometowns have not received the care they deserve. In some machinery factories in Shenyang, after the people who went to the interior to support the construction of new factories left, the welfare benefits that their families originally enjoyed were also cancelled. If they got sick, the clinic would not treat them; if they had difficulties, there was nowhere to ask for help. It is said that because these employees are no longer from the factory or the local area, these expenses cannot be reimbursed. Some factories even urged the families of transferred employees to move and asked them to vacate their dormitories.
    This approach obviously cannot help those in the interior to engage in construction work with peace of mind, nor can it encourage successors to follow in their footsteps with joy.
    Some people think that going to the interior to participate in construction is just a job transfer. Why not bring the family along and instead stay in the original place and cause trouble? They cannot understand this reasoning, so they intentionally or unintentionally adopt the attitude of "affection exists when the person is present, affection disappears when the person leaves," wanting to force these families to move to the new industrial zone voluntarily.
    To sever all ties and ignore everything after the person leaves is certainly a quick and easy solution. However, have these comrades considered what consequences would arise if all the construction workers brought their families along?
    Currently, in many new industrial cities and new industrial areas, the development of living and welfare facilities cannot keep up with the needs of population growth. An important reason for this is that too many construction workers bring their families. In some places, before the factory is even built, the "dependent population" has increased by tens of thousands, even two or three times more than those directly participating in the construction. In this way, before the factory even starts production, a lot of money must be spent to solve consumer problems such as dormitories, shops, clinics, roads, buses, and non-staple food supply. This is not only economically unfeasible but also makes it impossible to solve these problems to everyone's satisfaction. And when the factory is built, a large number of people will have to move to another place, and the expense of construction plus relocation fees is staggering. If the comrades who participate in the construction of the interior leave their families in their original place and only return to reunite with them during annual vacations, this expense can be greatly reduced. In this situation, the comrades who go to support the construction of the interior endure the pain of temporary separation and leave their families in their hometowns. Can it be said that they are not making sacrifices for the overall interests of the country? Can it be said that taking care of their families is unrelated to everyone and should not be a matter of concern?
    Even today, people cannot help but feel deep respect when they hear the words "old revolutionary base." In the current construction period, old industrial bases are like old revolutionary bases during the revolutionary period. They are the starting point for victory, the most powerful supporters of the people who are opening up new areas, and the most reliable rear areas. We believe that the people who remain in the old industrial bases will fully recognize their glorious responsibility, actively support the new industrial areas not only in production and manpower, but also enthusiastically take care of the families of the pioneers away from home. In this way, not only will the builders far away in the interior thank them, but everyone who cares about the construction of the motherland will also thank them with respect.

    关怀远征人
    孔桑
    近几年来，不断有大批的职工远离故乡，到内地去参加建设。他们是光荣的，他们肩负的责任是重大的。但是，他们留在故乡的家属，有一些却没有得到应有的关怀。在沈阳的某些机械工厂里，到内地去支援新厂建设的人走了，他们的家属原来所能享受的福利待遇也随着被取消了，有了病医务所不给治疗，有了困难也无处请求帮助。据说因为这些职工已不是本厂本地的人，这些费用无法报销。有个别工厂，甚至还催促被调职工的家属搬家，要她们把宿舍退让出来。
    这种做法显然不能帮助远在内地的人安心从事建设工作，更不能鼓励后继者心情愉快地去步他们的后尘了。
    有些人认为到内地去参加建设，不过是调动一下工作而已，为什么不把家眷带走，偏要留在原地给人添麻烦呢？他们想不通这个道理，便有意无意地采取了“人在人情在，人去人情亡”的态度，想挤得这些家属不得不自动地搬到新工业区去。
    一刀两断，人走了一切都不管了，这当然痛快省事。可是，这些同志有没有想到过，如果所有的建设者都把家属带上走，会产生什么样的后果呢？
    现在，许多新工业城市和新工业区中，生活福利设施的发展赶不上人口增长的需要，一个重要的原因就是因为建筑职工带的家属太多了。有些地方，工厂还没有建设起来，“被抚养人口”就已增加了好多万，甚至比直接参加建设的人还要多两三倍。这样，工厂还没有生产，就先要花很多钱来解决宿舍、商店、医务所、道路、公共汽车和副食品供应等等消费性的问题。这不但在经济上不合算，而且也无法把这些问题解决得使大家满意。而等到工厂一建成，大批人马又要随着搬到另一个地方去了，建设费再加上迁移费这一笔开支是大得惊人的。如果参加内地建设的人把家眷留在原地，只在每年休假的时候回去团聚一下，这笔开支就可以大大减少。在这种情况下，去支援内地建设的同志，忍受着暂时离别的痛苦，把家人留在故乡，能说不是为了国家的整体利益所做的牺牲吗？能说照顾他们的家属是和大家没有关系的、不应当关心的事吗？
    直到今日，人们听到“老根据地”这几个字时，还不能不引起深深的敬意。在目前建设时期，老工业基地正如革命时期的老根据地一样，它是胜利的出发点，是开拓新区的人们最有力的支持者，最可靠的大后方。我们相信，留守老工业基地的人们，一定会充分认识自己这个光荣的责任，不仅在生产上、人力上积极支持新工业区，而且也能热情地照顾远征者的家属。这样，不仅远在内地的建设者要感谢他们，连一切关怀祖国建设的人都会带着敬意来感谢他们的。
