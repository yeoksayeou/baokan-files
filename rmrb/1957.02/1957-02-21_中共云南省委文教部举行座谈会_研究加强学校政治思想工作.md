The Culture and Education Department of the CPC Yunnan Provincial Committee recently held several symposiums to study how to strengthen political and ideological work in schools. The Yunnan Provincial Committee's Culture and Education Department analyzed the current situation of schools, believing that Yunnan's education has greatly developed. Over the past year, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over school work, systematically adding and adjusting a number of leading cadres to schools, and developing and expanding Party and Youth League organizations. They have also done a lot of work in implementing the Party's policy on intellectuals, eliminating chaos in schools, and resolving major ideological issues for teachers and students at various stages. The socialist enthusiasm of teachers and students has also improved. Teachers generally can actively study their professional work and improve teaching, and students' learning consciousness has greatly improved. This is the main aspect of the current state of teachers and students. However, overall, the Party's work in schools is still a relatively weak link in the current work.

In order to further strengthen the Party's leadership over school work, in addition to continuing to strengthen and improve the leading cadres in schools, and continuing to select and send some cadres with considerable knowledge and good political and ideological qualities to work in schools, it is also necessary to earnestly strengthen the political and ideological work in schools. The regular central task of the school is teaching, but at the same time, political and ideological work must be taken as the foundation of all school work. At present, there are two tendencies in some schools. One is that since the proposal to march towards science and culture, they only care about professional work and do not care about politics, and the situation of "managing but not guiding" students has grown. Even among some political work cadres, there is also a situation of neglecting Party and Youth League work and only wanting to study teaching. The other is that some Party and Youth League work cadres have simplified political and ideological work, attempting to take on the task of political and ideological work by a few people and not being good at using various organizations to promote the strength of all parties to work.

According to the characteristics of school work, political and ideological work in schools must be carried out in the spirit of positive guidance and full persuasion. Simple and crude methods, excessive use of administrative methods, or small-mindedness in daring to manage will not achieve good results.

The basic content of current political and ideological work in schools, everyone believes, is still to strengthen socialist ideological education in combination with the current situation and tasks, and to overcome petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideology with the ideology of the working class. According to existing experience, it has been proven that the following measures are effective in strengthening political and ideological work in schools: First, in response to current affairs and policy issues and ideological conditions in schools, conduct ideological education in the form of political classes and reports. Second, seize on certain universal or prominent ideological and practical problems in the school during a certain period, and organize discussions in the form of symposiums, debates, and wall newspapers. This method of conducting discussions "on the spot" is a good way for the masses to conduct self-education, distinguish right from wrong, and improve understanding. Adopting this approach requires openness, not avoiding problems, and not being afraid of raising opposing opinions; on the other hand, it must strengthen leadership and not allow it to develop unchecked. Reasonable opinions and requirements put forward by everyone should be adopted and resolved reasonably; but it is also necessary to explain the difficulties in our progress in a realistic manner and emphasize the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily. Third, through visits, exchanges, get-togethers, and participation in social activities with educational significance, students have more opportunities to contact workers and peasants, understand the production and life of workers and peasants, and learn the ideological qualities of working people from practice.

Of course, the basis of political and ideological work in schools lies in strengthening the construction of the Party's grassroots organizations in schools, first of all to ensure the Party's leadership. Education and assistance must be strengthened for Party branches and members, and attention must be paid to summarizing experience from grassroots activities.

### 中共云南省委文教部举行座谈会  研究加强学校政治思想工作

    中共云南省委文教部举行座谈会
    研究加强学校政治思想工作
    本报讯　最近中共云南省委文教部召开了几次座谈会，研究如何加强学校中的政治思想工作。云南省委文教部分析了当前学校的状况，认为云南教育事业有很大发展，一年多来，各级党委加强了对学校工作的领导，有计划地向学校加派和调整了一批领导骨干，发展壮大了党、团组织；在贯彻执行党的知识分子政策，消除学校的混乱现象，以及解决教师、学生各个时期的重大思想问题等方面，做了不少工作。广大师生的社会主义积极性也有了提高。教师们一般都能积极钻研业务，改进教学工作，学生的学习自觉性有很大提高，这是当前师生面貌的主要方面。但是，从整个看来，党在学校里的工作仍然是当前各项工作中比较薄弱的一环。
    为了进一步加强党对学校工作的领导，除了继续加强和提高学校的领导骨干，继续选派一些具备相当知识水平、政治思想品质较好的干部到学校工作以外，还需要认真地加强学校的政治思想工作。学校经常的中心任务是教学，但同时必须把政治思想工作作为全部学校工作的基础。目前在一部分学校中，有两种偏向，一种是，自提出向科学文化进军以后，只管业务，不问政治，对学生“管教不管导”的情况有所滋长；即使在一部分政治工作干部中，也有忽视党、团工作，只想钻研教学业务的情况。另一种是，若干党、团工作干部，有把政治思想工作简单化的情况，企图把政治思想工作的任务由少数人包揽下来，不善于运用各种组织推动各方面的力量去工作。
    根据学校工作的特点，在学校中进行政治思想工作必须贯彻正面引导、充分说服的精神，简单粗暴、过多采用行政办法或小手小脚不敢管理，都不会收到好的效果。
    当前学校政治思想工作的基本内容，大家认为仍然是结合当前形势、任务，加强社会主义的思想教育，以工人阶级思想克服小资产阶级思想和资产阶级思想。根据现有经验，证明采取以下措施来加强学校的政治思想工作是有效的：一，针对某一时期的时事政策问题和学校中的思想状况，采用上政治课、作报告的形式，进行思想教育。二，抓到某一时期学校带有普遍性的或突出的思想问题和实际问题，以座谈会、辩论会、墙报等形式组织讨论。这种“就地取材”开展讨论的办法是群众进行自我教育，辨明是非，提高认识的一种较好的形式。采取这种方式，一方面要求放得开，不要回避问题，不怕提出相反的意见；另方面必须加强领导，不能放任自流。对于大家提出的合理的意见和要求，应当加以采纳，合理解决；但也还必须实事求是地说明我们前进中的困难，强调勤俭办学的精神。三、通过参观、访问、联欢和参加带有教育意义的社会活动等，使学生有更多的机会去接触工农，了解工农的生产和生活，使他们从实际中学习劳动人民的思想品质。
    当然，作为学校中政治思想工作的基础，还在于加强学校中党的基层组织建设，首先保证党的领导。对支部和党员，必须加强教育和帮助，重视从基层活动中去总结经验。
