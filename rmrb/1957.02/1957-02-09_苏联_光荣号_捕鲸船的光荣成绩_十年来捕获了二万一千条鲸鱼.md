Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: According to TASS reports: The Soviet "Slava" whaling ship has captured approximately 21,000 whales in the Antarctic over the past ten years. During the same period, the whaling crew never experienced any serious accidents or casualties.

The whaling captain, Solyanik, who goes to the Antarctic for whaling every year, recently published an article in the Soviet "Pravda" newspaper, in which he talked about these circumstances. He also said that many of the captured whales were blue-grey baleen whales. Each of them weighs about 150 tons. About 200,000 tons of valuable oil, and thousands of tons of whale meal and whale liver for the food industry and agricultural sector have been produced from these whales.

The "Slava" whaling ship was the first Soviet vessel to navigate the route opened up by the Russians who first discovered Antarctica in the early 19th century.

The technical equipment of the entire whaling fleet is constantly being supplemented and innovated. Currently, in addition to the "Slava" whaling base, there are eighteen whaling ships, three of which are huge diesel-electric ships. The latest technical equipment such as radio buoys and radar are widely used on board.

During the voyage, the whaling personnel, including thirty women, lived a very pleasant life. They could listen to lectures on various topics, read their own newspapers, watch movies, participate in various amateur art groups, and more than two hundred people were students of various Soviet correspondence schools.

The Soviet government highly values the achievements of the whalers. They have been awarded Soviet medals and awards, and the best whalers have also been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.

    苏联“光荣号”捕鲸船的光荣成绩
    十年来捕获了二万一千条鲸鱼
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联“光荣号”捕鲸船十年来在南极捕获了约二万一千条鲸鱼。在同一期间，捕鲸队人员从来没有发生过任何严重事故和伤亡。
    每年都要到南极捕鲸的捕鲸队长索利亚尼克不久以前在苏联“真理报”上发表了一篇文章，他在文章中谈到了这些情况。他还说，捕获的鲸鱼中有不少是青灰色的大鲸鱼。它们每条都重一百五十吨左右。已经用这些鲸鱼制造了约二十万吨贵重的油脂，几千吨供食品工业和农业部门用的鲸鱼粉和鲸鱼肝。
    “光荣号”捕鲸船是苏联最先沿着上一世纪最初发现南极的俄国人所开辟的道路航行的船只。
    整个捕鲸队的技术装备不断得到补充和革新。目前除了“光荣号”捕鲸基地以外，还有十八只捕鲸船，其中有三只是巨大的柴油电动船。船上广泛利用无线电浮标和雷达等最新技术装备。
    在航行的时候，包括三十位妇女的捕鲸人员们过着非常愉快的生活。他们可以听到各种题目的讲演，阅读自己的报纸，观看电影，参加各种业余艺术小组，还有两百多人是苏联各种函授学校的学生。
    苏联政府对捕鲸者的成绩给予很高的评价。他们获得了苏联的勋章和奖章，最优秀的捕鲸者还获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。
