    Shaanxi's Winter Irrigation Work is Fast and Early
    Great Enthusiasm for Water Conservancy Construction, Many Projects Can Be Used for Summer Irrigation
    (Our Newspaper) News: Shaanxi is universally grasping winter irrigation work. As of January 15th, the irrigated area of state-owned canals was approximately 1.7 million mu; according to incomplete statistics from the Hanzhong and Shangluo Special Districts and 24 counties in Guanzhong, the winter irrigated area for small canals, weirs, waterwheels, and well irrigation areas was 1.05 million mu. The characteristics of winter irrigation are: early, fast, and extensive irrigation. The Guanzhong area generally started 20 days earlier than in previous years, and the irrigated area of state-owned canals exceeded any previous year. After Xianyang County completed 95% of the summer field irrigation task by the end of December, they also irrigated the 20,000 mu of fields in the Weihe Canal irrigation area for a second time.
    During the intense winter irrigation, the peasants' enthusiasm is high. Members of the Five-Star Cooperative in Xi'an City composed a ditty for winter irrigation: "Five stars, five stars shining bright, cooperative members busy irrigating day and night. No water in the well, build new canals, and even lift water to the highlands. Strive for every wheat field to see water, guarantee a bumper harvest and more grain."
    The enthusiasm for water conservancy construction in winter is also great. The first water storage reservoir in the Guanzhong area – the Yangtian River Reservoir in Zhouzhi County – started construction in mid-October last year, and the peasants have persisted in construction in the severe cold. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of April and can irrigate more than 22,000 mu of land. By January 10th, the Hanzhong Special District had started construction on 26 reservoirs, 17 mountain bay ponds, and a large number of weir and pond projects. Most of these projects can be used for summer irrigation this year, and it is estimated that the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 100,000 mu. This year, all projects have strengthened technical guidance. The townships and agricultural cooperatives in the project areas have also generally established construction organizations this year to specifically take charge of construction tasks.

### 陕西冬灌工作又快又早  兴修水利劲头很大，许多工程可以赶上夏灌使用

    陕西冬灌工作又快又早
    兴修水利劲头很大，许多工程可以赶上夏灌使用
    本报讯　陕西各地普遍抓紧了冬灌工作。到1月15日止，国营各渠道灌溉面积约有一百七十万亩；各小型渠堰和水车水井灌区，据汉中、商雒两个专区和关中二十四个县不完全统计，冬灌面积为一百零五万亩。冬灌的特点是：灌得早、快、多。关中地区一般较往年提前二十天，国营各渠灌溉面积超过以往任何一年。咸阳县在12月底完成夏田面积的95％灌溉任务以后，在渭惠渠灌区的两万亩田地上，还灌了第二遍。
    在紧张的冬灌中，农民情绪高涨。西安市五星社的社员们，为冬灌编了顺口溜：“五星五星放金光，社员日夜浇地忙。井内没水修新渠，还要提水上高梁。争取麦田都见水，保证丰收多打粮”。
    冬季兴修水利的劲头也很大。关中地区蓄贮雨水第一个水库工程——盩厔县的仰天河水库，在去年10月中旬开工以后，农民们坚持在严寒中施工。这个工程预定在4月底竣工，可浇地二万二千多亩。汉中专区到1月10日，开工的水库有二十六座，山湾塘库十七座和大量堰塘工程。这些工程大部分都可以赶上今年夏灌。预计夏灌可扩大面积十万多亩。所有工程，今年都加强了技术指导。工程所在地区的乡和农业社，今年也普遍建立了施工组织，专门负责修建任务。
