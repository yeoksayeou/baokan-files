Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 4th. Sichuan Province's paper mills are tapping the potential of their equipment and will significantly increase paper production this year to supply the market.

　　The 601, 602, and Zhongyuan paper mills, which account for 70% of the province's paper industry output, as well as the Chongqing Paper Mill, have all set production increase and conservation plans. Employees at the 602 Paper Mill are further exploring production potential in all aspects of production. Under the conditions of ensuring machine safety and product quality, they have found ways to increase paper machine speed, increase paper machine operating time, and produce wide-format paper, so that the daily output of each paper machine is increased by 1% to 10% compared to the original. In this way, the entire factory can increase newsprint production by 780 tons this year. At the factory-wide employee representative meeting held in late January at the Zhongyuan Paper Mill, the representatives discussed and studied that the key to the factory's current production is insufficient cooking capacity, creating an imbalance between pulping and papermaking. In response to key production issues, employee representatives from the pulping workshop proposed reducing production auxiliary time, improving labor organization, and shortening the cooking time from nine and a half hours to five and a half hours, which could greatly increase pulp production. The papermaking workshop proposed methods such as widening the paper web and avoiding shutdowns to increase paper production. After repeated calculations and exploring potential, the entire factory can increase paper production by 1,864 tons this year, accounting for 16.25% of this year's production plan. The planned output of machine-made paper at the 601 Paper Mill this year will increase by 43% compared to last year. Employees in the factory's capital construction and production departments are actively taking measures to ensure that two new paper machines are put into production ahead of schedule and that old equipment is fully utilized. For example, after overhauling a discarded boiler in the Fourdrinier wire section and putting it into production, this section will be able to increase the production of typing paper by 208 tons this year.

　　Each factory is also starting from saving raw materials and finding substitutes to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The main product of the 601 Paper Mill this year, coated printing paper, will use bamboo pulp for all ingredients to save wood pulp. The Fourdrinier wire section of this factory also plans to install white water recovery equipment to reduce fiber loss, reduce the amount of pulp used per ton of paper by 2.77%, and save 124 tons of pulp throughout the year. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw bamboo supply, the Chongqing Paper Mill recently successfully used a kind of wild thatch grass growing in the mountains of northern Sichuan to produce a batch of posting paper. The paper's gloss, whiteness, uniformity, and water resistance all meet quality standards. This will ensure that the entire factory can increase the production of various glossy papers by more than 400 tons this year.

### 挖掘设备潜力　寻找新的原料  四川各纸厂订出增产指标

    挖掘设备潜力　寻找新的原料
    四川各纸厂订出增产指标
    新华社重庆4日电　四川省各造纸工厂发挥设备潜力，今年将大量增产纸张供应市场。
      占全省造纸工业产量70％的六零一、六零二、中原等三个造纸厂和重庆造纸厂，都已经订出增产节约计划。六零二造纸厂职工，从生产的各个环节进一步挖掘生产潜力。他们在保证机器安全和产品质量的条件下，找出提高造纸机车速、增加造纸机作业时间和抄造宽边纸等办法，使各台造纸机的日产量都比原来提高1％到10％。这样，全厂今年可以增产七百八十吨新闻纸。中原造纸厂在1月下旬举行的全厂职工代表会议上，代表们讨论研究厂内当前生产的关键是蒸煮能力不够，制浆与造纸之间不平衡。针对生产关键问题，制浆车间的职工代表提出减少生产辅助时间，改进劳动组织，把煮浆时间由九时半缩短为五时半，因而可以大大提高纸浆生产量。抄纸车间提出改宽纸幅、避免停车等办法来增产纸张。经过反复算细账，挖潜力，全厂今年可以增产纸张一千八百六十四吨，占今年生产计划的16.25％。六零一造纸厂今年机制纸的计划产量，将比去年增加43％。这个厂的基本建设和生产部门的职工，都积极采取措施，保证两台新造纸机提前投入生产，并且充分利用旧设备。如圆网车间将一个废弃锅炉加以大修后投入生产，就能使这个车间今年生产的打字纸增产二百零八吨。
    各厂还从节约原料和寻找代用品着手，克服原料不足的困难。六零一造纸厂今年的主要产品——胶版印刷纸，将全部采用竹浆配料，以节约木浆。这个厂的长网车间还计划安装白水回收设备，减少纤维流失，使每吨纸的用浆量降低2.77％，全年能节约纸浆一百二十四吨。重庆造纸厂为克服原竹供应不足的困难，最近利用一种川北山地野生的蓑草，成功地制出一批张贴纸，纸的光洁白度、匀度和抗水度，都达到质量标准。这样就能保证全厂今年增产四百多吨各种光面纸。
