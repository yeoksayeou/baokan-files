Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 12th. An article published by the Economic Department of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party in the Indonesian "People's Daily" on the 7th stated that the colonial nature of the Indonesian economy has not changed much because the position of foreign capital in Indonesia remains the same as before.

The article stated that the Indonesian government's annual budget deficit averages about 2.6 billion rupiah. According to foreign experts, foreign capitalists remit about 15 billion rupiah from Indonesia to their home countries each year, which is equal to the total annual financial expenditure of the Indonesian government.

The article, entitled "Building an Indonesian National Economy Does Not Require Further Absorption of Foreign Investment," argues that the draft bill on absorbing foreign capital formulated by the Indonesian government last year contradicts the people's desire to oppose foreign monopoly capital. The aforementioned draft will be discussed in Congress this month.

The article cited incomplete statistics obtained from the government, stating that the total foreign capital in Indonesia is US$2.1 billion, equivalent to approximately 63 billion Indonesian rupiah (calculated at US$1 to 30 rupiah). The largest investment comes from the Netherlands, accounting for US$1.47 billion. In recent years, American investment in Indonesia has increased to US$350 million, ranking second. There are also investments from Britain, France, Belgium, and other countries. Foreign capitalists earn US$500 million annually, calculated at a profit rate of 25%.

The article stated that this foreign capital almost controls all of Indonesia's international trade, industry, mining, and plantations producing high-grade raw materials (such as plantations producing high-grade rubber). Dutch investment in industrial and mining enterprises amounts to approximately 11.2 billion Indonesian rupiah, and investment in plantations amounts to approximately 24 billion Indonesian rupiah. Only a smaller portion of industrial and mining enterprises, and some rubber and coconut plantations, are operated by the Indonesian government and Indonesian citizens. In terms of transportation, apart from railway and postal and telecommunications, which are already state-owned, other industries such as inter-island shipping and transportation with neighboring countries are operated by foreign enterprises. Foreign capital also has a significant influence in the banking sector. To date, Indonesian government banks and banks operated by national capitalists cannot compare with the large foreign banks in Indonesia.

The article stated that 95% of Indonesia's main production is controlled by large foreign capitalists. The article pointed out that the result of foreign capital monopolizing the Indonesian economy has led to extreme poverty for the Indonesian people. According to statistics from the Dutch colonial government before World War II, there were only 640 wealthy Indonesians with assets of more than 120,000 rupiah, accounting for 0.01% of the Indonesian population. However, there were 7,714 foreigners (mostly Europeans) with the same amount of wealth.

The article also exposed that foreign capitalists frequently engage in political and subversive activities in Indonesia. The article pointed out that since political power is now in the hands of the Indonesian nation, the way to overcome the lack of funds in building a national economy is not to rely on foreign investment, but to take clear actions against certain foreign enterprises in Indonesia, such as, as Sukarno said, seriously implementing the abolition of the Round Table Conference agreements. The article stated that there are currently legal and factual grounds to take clear actions against Dutch capital forces in Indonesia, such as starting by prohibiting the repatriation of Dutch capital profits to the Netherlands, preparing to take over its important enterprises in Indonesia such as port enterprises, shipping industry, power enterprises, mining, and prohibiting Dutch banks from continuing to operate in Indonesia.

The article concluded by saying that rejecting new foreign investment in Indonesia does not mean that it is unnecessary to establish trade and economic relations with foreign countries. On the contrary, in the development of the national economy, it is necessary to expand foreign trade on the basis of mutual benefit, and it is also possible to accept financial, economic, and technical assistance that is not attached to political and military conditions.

### 印度尼西亚共产党中央经济部指出  外国垄断资本仍居控制地位  主张在建设民族经济中不再吸收外资

    印度尼西亚共产党中央经济部指出
    外国垄断资本仍居控制地位
    主张在建设民族经济中不再吸收外资
    据新华社雅加达12日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央经济部7日在印度尼西亚“人民日报”发表的一篇文章中说，印度尼西亚经济的殖民地性质目前还没有什么改变，原因是由于外国资本在印度尼西亚的地位还是照旧不变。
    文章说，印度尼西亚政府每年预算的财政赤字平均约为二十六亿盾。而据外国专家估计，外国资本家每年从印度尼西亚汇到他们本国去的利润约为一百五十亿盾，等于印度尼西亚政府每年财政支出的总和。
    这篇题目为“建设印度尼西亚民族经济不必再吸收外资”的文章认为，印度尼西亚政府去年拟定的关于吸收外国资本的法案草案，同人民反对外国垄断资本的愿望相抵触。上述草案本月间将在国会中讨论。
    文章引用从政府方面获得的不完全的统计说，在印度尼西亚的外国资本共二十一亿美元，约合印度尼西亚币六百三十亿盾（以一美元合三十盾计算）。其中以荷兰的投资最大，占十四亿七千万美元。美国近年来在印度尼西亚的投资已经增加到三亿五千万美元，占第二位。此外还有英、法、比等国的投资。外国资本家每年获得的利润，以利润率25％计算就有五亿美元。
    文章说，这些外国资本几乎控制了印度尼西亚全部的国际贸易、工矿业和生产高级原料的种植园（如出产高级橡胶的种植园）。荷兰在工矿企业方面的投资约有一百一十二亿印度尼西亚盾，在种植园方面的投资约有二百四十亿印度尼西亚盾。只有规模较小的一部分工矿企业和一些橡胶园和椰子园为印度尼西亚政府和印度尼西亚公民所经营。在交通运输方面，除了铁路交通和邮电交通已经由国家经营以外，其他如岛际航运业和同邻国的交通业，都由外国企业经营。外国资本在银行方面的势力也很大。到目前为止，印度尼西亚政府的银行和民族资本家经营的银行，都还不能同在印度尼西亚的外国大银行相比。
    文章说，印度尼西亚的主要生产有95％被外国大资本家所操纵。文章指出，外国资本垄断印度尼西亚经济的结果，已经使得印度尼西亚人民生活陷于极度贫困。据第二次世界大战以前荷兰殖民政府机构的统计，财产在十二万盾以上的富有的印度尼西亚人只有六百四十人，占印度尼西亚人口的0.01％。而拥有同等数量财富的外国人（其中大部分是欧洲人）却有七千七百一十四人。
    文章还揭露了外国资本家经常在印度尼西亚搞政治活动和颠覆活动。文章指出，目前政权已经掌握在印度尼西亚民族手中，克服在建设民族经济中资金缺乏的办法，不是依靠外国投资，而是要对在印度尼西亚的某些外国企业采取明确的行动，如苏加诺所说，要认真实施废除圆桌会议协定。文章说，目前在法律上和事实上有依据，可以对荷兰在印度尼西亚的资本势力采取明确的行动，例如从禁止荷兰资本利润汇回荷兰着手，准备接收它在印度尼西亚的海港企业、航运业、电力企业、矿业等重要企业，以及禁止荷兰的银行继续在印度尼西亚经营。
    文章最后说，拒绝新的外资投入印度尼西亚不是意味着无须同外国建立贸易和经济关系，相反地，在发展民族经济中必须在互利的基础上扩大对外贸易，同时也可以接受不附带政治和军事条件的财政、经济援助和技术援助。
