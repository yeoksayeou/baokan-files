    Soviet Experts and China's Plastics Industry
    Engineer of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, Yang Guangqi
    My first meeting with expert Beskhlebnov more than three years ago left a deep impression on me. When he learned that I would be his translator, he was very happy and immediately enthusiastically introduced me to various books, and repeatedly told me to go to him at any time if I had any questions. From that day on, I was attracted by his unique enthusiasm and humility, and I began to develop a strong interest in plastics.
    Today, expert Beskhlebnov has returned to his country for more than a year, and China's plastics industry has also achieved certain development. In the past, we could not produce many plastics ourselves, but now we can not only produce them, but also have more varieties that we are researching and trial-producing, and will be put into production one after another in the future. All of this is inseparable from the hard work of expert Beskhlebnov.
    Starting from Scratch Empty-Handed
    Looking back at the situation three years ago, I remember that when we learned that the Soviet government had sent a plastics expert to help China develop its chemical industry, everyone felt a little strange, because the concept of plastic was vague in everyone's minds. Some people could barely equate "Bakelite," "nylon stockings," and "oilcloth bags" with the word plastic, but some people were surprised and said: Is there even a specialist in plastics?!
    The conditions for expert Beskhlebnov to start working were very difficult, it can be said that he was "starting from scratch." The first step in carrying out the work was to understand the situation, but who to understand from? At that time, the comrades in our agency did not have a good grasp of the national plastics industry situation, because the legacy of the plastics industry that old China left us was too small, just like many other sectors of the national economy, and our knowledge of plastics was also too little. In this way, before the expert could understand the situation from us, he had to first introduce the situation to us. He began to give reports, starting from the definition of plastics and the current situation of the world plastics industry, all the way to the methods and uses of various plastics, in order to arouse everyone's interest and attention to plastics. From this time on, everyone began to realize that the scope of plastics was much larger than we generally understood. It could not only be used to make Bakelite switches, stockings, and bags, but also bearings. It could be used for sand casting. It could be used to make various brightly colored boxes, cups, and arc-resistant igniters. It could be used to make heat-insulating and sound-insulating porous materials. Various polymer compounds could be used to glue wooden boards and wood chips. Bonding metal was stronger than rivets, and all-purpose glue was something that could stick anything. It was also from that time that everyone knew that the world's plastic production had greatly exceeded two million tons and was still growing. The facts made us increasingly realize a sentence that experts often said: "Without the plastics industry, the development of any sector of the modern national economy is unimaginable. Plastics have penetrated into all aspects of industrial technology and people's lives."
    In order to understand the situation in detail, the expert spared no effort to travel almost everywhere in China where there was a plastics industry, from Harbin to Guangzhou, from Shanghai to Chongqing, from factories to small workshops in the alleyways, conducting investigations and research on the national plastics production and scientific research. He "excavated" China's plastics industry like he was unearthing a treasure, asking around everywhere. When he heard that there was even a small plastic factory somewhere, he felt happy from the bottom of his heart. Finally, he had a comprehensive understanding of China's plastics industry, and based on the information he collected himself, he was the first to put forward a report on the state of China's plastics industry and its future development direction. We should deeply thank expert Beskhlebnov, it was he who planned the development outline and steps of the plastics industry for us. Even today, many of the suggestions and data he put forward are still important basis for our work.
    Conscientious and Tireless in Teaching
    The expert had a lot of work to do during his time in China, from long-term planning, scientific research plans, and the development direction of each factory, to solving various specific problems in scientific research, production, and design. But he was very conscientious and responsible for every piece of work. When comrades came to him to talk about work, he always talked with such energy, sometimes for too long, and when the comrades advised him to rest, he would never leave the work for the next day.
    When on business trips, the work was even more intense. He often talked with many working comrades from morning to night. After getting off work and returning to his residence in the evening, he still studied the questions raised by everyone and prepared answers. Sometimes he felt unwell, but he still insisted on working. For those specific questions that could not be answered on the spot, he always wrote them down one by one, and after returning to Beijing, he consulted materials, and even wrote letters back to his country to ask, and answered everything that could be answered by correspondence.
    Anyone who has been in contact with Soviet experts probably has a common feeling, that is, no matter what the expert's profession, they have a great interest in their profession. Expert Beskhlebnov's feelings for the plastics profession were very strong. He was thinking about plastics anytime and anywhere. As long as anyone's conversation involved plastics, it would immediately attract his attention and interest. After finishing his work, his mind was still constantly thinking about some unresolved issues or talking to you about some new, creative opinions or ideas; I heard the expert's wife say that he often thought about this and that at home, always wanting to come up with some new ideas, so he also had a small laboratory in his own home. To achieve some achievements in science, it is impossible to leave the tenacious spirit and enthusiasm for the cause. All comrades who have been in contact with comrade Beskhlebnov have a deep understanding of his spirit of research.
    The expert was very concerned about cultivating China's own technical cadres. In his work, he always tried to enable Chinese comrades to obtain more comprehensive knowledge. He often told us not to simply copy formulas and process conditions, but to understand the principles behind them, not to mechanically copy, but to combine them with China's specific conditions and apply them, and to cultivate our own ability to work independently. Therefore, he never simply "handed over" the information, but always took the opportunity to combine work and systematically explain the basic principles to the comrades; when comrades encountered problems, he always answered them patiently, making you clear. For example, in order to cultivate our design talents, the expert personally and systematically gave many lectures. In order to improve the technical level of research workers and production personnel, the expert organized a national plastics research class for us. In order to better cultivate our own technical cadres, the expert suggested that Chinese comrades serve as lecturers, and the expert helped prepare the lessons. In addition, he often took the opportunity to go to factories and research units in various places to give various special reports. It is precisely because of the help and guidance of expert Beskhlebnov and other Soviet experts and the efforts of the comrades that our design force in plastics has grown from nothing, and has grown to be able to independently design fairly complex plastic production. Our research force has also grown from a negligible force to be able to carry out multi-faceted research work on a broad front at the same time.
    Good Teacher and Helpful Friend
    For me personally, expert Beskhlebnov is my good teacher. Usually in my work, when I encountered any problems, he always explained them to me in detail. Sometimes I asked a question that only needed to know "yes" or "no," and he often talked to me for half an hour, an hour, or even longer. The expert's intention was very clear. He wanted to pass on his knowledge to Chinese comrades without reservation. In addition, in order to enable us to learn plastics industry knowledge more systematically, the expert took the initiative to propose to give me lectures every day, and he did what he said, and his first job every morning when he came to work was this, without any slack. I remember that for a considerable period of time before he returned to his country, I could not be his translator because I had some other work. In the first few days of this period, I unconsciously put aside the matter of learning because I was relatively busy. One day, the expert called me and said:
    "Is it possible for you to take some time every day to continue learning, because if you don't learn again, I won't be able to complete the planned plan before I return to my country. I hope to be able to talk as much as possible before I leave." In this way, my learning continued. When the expert gave lectures, in addition to theory, there were also many of his own work experiences and research insights. He enthusiastically showed me a lot of information, because he considered that these might be what we needed in our future work.
    The expert's style and working methods have greatly educated me and all the comrades who have worked with him, and have brought strength to my work.
    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the signing of this great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, I would like to express my special respect and gratitude to my good teacher, comrade Beskhlebnov. All Chinese comrades and friends who have been in contact with him also deeply miss him. In addition, I would also like to take this opportunity to express my greatest respect and gratitude to expert Isakov, expert Oleinik, who are also my good teachers and have given me a lot of knowledge and have greatly helped me in all aspects, and to all Soviet experts in our country. The names of these experts, with the increasing development of our industry, will be increasingly deeply engraved in the hearts of their Chinese comrades and friends.

    苏联专家和我国塑料工业
    化学工业部工程师　杨光启
    三年多前和别什赫诺夫专家的第一次见面，就给我留下了深刻的印象。当他知道我将做他的翻译时，非常高兴，立即热情地给我介绍各种书籍，并且再三嘱咐有问题一定随时去找他。从那天起，我就为他所特有的热情与谦虚吸引住了，我开始对塑料发生浓厚的兴趣。
    今天别什赫诺夫专家已经回国一年多了，我国的塑料工业也获得了一定的发展。以前，我们自己不能生产的许多塑料，现在我们不仅也能生产，而且还有更多的品种我们都在研究试制中，今后都将陆续投入生产。所有这一切是与别什赫诺夫专家的辛勤劳动分不开的。
    赤手空拳平地起家
    回想三年前的情况，记得那时当我们知道苏联政府派来一位塑料专家帮助我国发展化学工业时，大家都感觉有些奇怪，因为塑料这个名词在大家头脑中的概念是模糊的，有些人只能勉勉强强地把“电木”、“玻璃丝袜”、“玻璃皮包”等与塑料这个词等同起来，但也有人吃惊地说：塑料这行还有专门人搞哪！？
    别什赫诺夫专家开始工作的条件是非常困难的，可以说是“平地起家”。开展工作的第一步，是了解情况，但是向谁了解呢？当时我们机关的工作同志，对全国塑料工业的情况是不掌握的，因为旧中国给我们留下的塑料工业的遗产正如国民经济的其他许多部门一样是太少了，我们对塑料的知识也太少了。这样，专家在向我们了解情况之前，必须首先向我们介绍情况。他开始作报告，从塑料的定义、世界塑料工业的现状讲起，一直讲到各种塑料的制法和用途，以引起大家对塑料的兴趣和重视。从这时起大家才开始知道塑料的范畴比我们一般所了解的要大得多，它不仅可以制电木开关以及丝袜、皮包，而且还可以制轴承，可用于翻砂铸造，可以制各种色彩鲜艳的盒子、杯子以及耐电弧的发火器，可以制绝热、隔音的多孔材料，各种高分子化合物的胶可以用于粘合木板、碎木，用来粘合金属比铆钉还要结实，万能胶则是无所不粘的东西。也是从那个时候起，大家才知道全世界塑料的产量已大大超过二百万吨，而且还在不断增长中。事实使我们越来越体会到专家常说的一句话：“没有塑料工业，现代国民经济任何部门的发展都是不可想像的。塑料已经深入工业技术和人民生活的各个方面了。”
    专家为了详细了解情况，不辞劳苦地几乎跑遍了中国有塑料工业的每一个地方，从哈尔滨到广州，从上海到重庆，从工厂到里弄内的小作坊，对全国塑料生产与科学研究的情况作了调查研究。他如同发掘至宝那样，“发掘”我国的塑料工业，到处打听，当他听说什么地方那怕只有一个小小的塑料工厂时，他都从心里感到高兴。终于，他对我国的塑料工业有了一个全面的了解，根据自己亲手收集的资料，他第一个提出了关于我国塑料工业的状况以及今后发展方向的报告。我们应该深深感谢别什赫诺夫专家，是他为我们规划了塑料工业的发展轮廓与步骤。一直到今天，他提出的许多建议与数据仍然是我们工作中的重要依据。
    认真负责诲人不倦
    专家在中国期间的工作是非常多的，从长远规划、科学研究计划、每个工厂的发展方向，一直到解决科学研究、生产、设计中的各式各样的具体问题。但是对每一件工作他都是非常认真负责。当同志们来找他谈工作时，他总是谈得那样有劲，有时谈的时间太长，同志们劝他休息，他总不会把工作留给第二天的。
      出差时，工作就更紧张了，常常是从早到晚川流不息地与许多工作同志谈话，晚上下班回到住处，仍然研究大家提出的问题，准备解答。有时候身体不大舒服，仍旧坚持工作。对于那些不能就地回答的具体问题，他总是一一记下，回到北京后，翻阅资料，甚至写信回国去问，凡是能够作答的都一一用通信方式回答。
    凡是与苏联专家接触过的同志大概都有一个共同的感觉，就是不论那个专业的专家都对自己的专业有极大的兴趣。别什赫诺夫专家对塑料专业的感情是非常浓厚的。他随时随地都想着塑料，任何人谈话中只要一牵涉到塑料，就会立即引起他的注意和兴趣。工作完毕之后，他的脑子也仍然不停地想着一些没有解决的问题或与你交谈一些新的、创造性的意见或想法；我听专家的夫人说，他在自己家里也是经常想这想那，总是想搞出些什么新的名堂来，因此他自己家里也有一个小小的试验室。要想在科学上获得一些成就，离开对事业的顽强精神与热情是不行的，凡是与别什赫诺夫同志接触过的同志都对他的钻研精神有很深的体会。
    专家非常关心培养中国自己的技术干部的问题。他在工作中总是设法使中国同志能够获得更多的、较全面的知识，他经常告诉我们不要简单地抄录配方和工艺条件，必须了解其中的原理，不要生搬硬套，而要结合中国的具体情况加以运用，要培养起自己独立工作的能力。因此他从来不是简单地把资料“转手”一下，总是一有机会就结合工作，给同志们系统地讲解基本原理；碰到同志们有问题，总是不厌其烦地解答，使你一清二楚。譬如为了培养我们的设计人材，专家亲自系统地讲了许多课。为了提高研究工作人员与生产人员的技术水平，专家为我们组织了全国性的塑料研究班，为了更好地培养我国自己的技术干部，专家提议由中国同志担任讲解员，由专家帮助备课。此外，他常利用去各地工厂、研究单位的机会，作各种专题报告。正是由于别什赫诺夫专家与其他苏联专家的帮助、指导与同志们的努力，我们在塑料方面的设计力量已经从无到有，而且已经成长到能够独立设计相当复杂的塑料生产了。我们的研究力量也从微不足道的力量成长到能够同时在宽广的战线上开展多方面的研究工作了。
    良师和益友
    对于我个人来说，别什赫诺夫专家则是我的良师。平时在工作中，当我遇到什么问题时，他总是详细地给我解释，有时我问一个在我只需要知道“是”或“不是”的问题，他往往给我讲半小时、一小时甚至更久。专家的用心是很明显的，他是想把他的知识无保留地传授给中国同志。除此之外，为了使我们更有系统地学习塑料工业知识，专家主动提出每天给我讲课，而且说到就做到，每天早晨一上班他的第一件工作就是这个，一点也不放松。记得在他回国前相当长的一段时间中，我因为有些别的工作不能做他的翻译了。在这段时期的开头一些日子里，我因为比较忙，就无形中把学习的事搁下了，一天专家把我找去了，他说：
  “你是不是可能每天抽一点时间继续学习，因为如果再不学，我回国之前就不能完成预定的计划了，我希望在离开之前能够尽量多讲一些。”这样，我的学习又坚持下去了。专家讲课时，除理论外，还有许多他自己的工作经验与研究心得，他热情地给我看许多资料，因为他考虑到这些可能是我们今后工作中所需要的。
    专家的作风和工作方法给我本人和所有与他工作过的同志以很大的教育，给我的工作带来了力量。
    在此伟大的中苏友好互助同盟条约签订七周年的时候，我愿意向我的良师别什赫诺夫同志表示特别的敬意和感谢，所有与他接触过的中国同志和朋友也都深深地怀念着他。此外，我也愿意趁这个机会，对同样是我的良师，同样给我许多知识，对我各方面有很大帮助的伊萨科夫专家、奥列尼克专家和所有在我国的苏联专家表示我最大的敬意与感谢。这些专家的名字随着我们工业的日益发展，将日益深刻地铭记在他们的中国同志和朋友的心上。
