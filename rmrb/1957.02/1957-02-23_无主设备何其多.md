How Many Ownerless Devices There Are

　　Last year, when the central warehouse of the supply department of the Southwest First Engineering Company had just erected its framework, it unexpectedly received a batch of precision instruments sent by the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Navigation Administration. Later, they received some wrongly delivered machinery and other equipment.

　　Seeing the machinery and instruments rusting in the warehouse, and the advanced freight charges and overdue fines accumulating, the supply department of the Southwest First Engineering Company, starting in October last year, wrote letters and sent people to relevant units to inquire, and even adopted the method of "delivering goods to the door" to find the owners for some planers, line cutting machines, etc. Some belonged to the Capital Construction Department of the Southwest Engineering Management Bureau, and some belonged to the General Party Committee... However, some items, after repeated inquiries, still could not find their owners. At the end of last year, there were still twenty-five boxes of instruments, machinery, etc., in the warehouse that were unclaimed; the accounts showed that there were also 9,100 yuan in advanced freight charges, and it was not known who would repay them.

　　Until now, boxes of large and small machines and instruments are still being shipped in continuously. On January 3rd, they received twenty boxes of "starting blocks." The person in charge of the supply department said: "How could our construction department order so many sporting goods? I don’t know when these will be returned to their rightful owners!"

    无主设备何其多
    去年，西南第一工程公司供应处的中心仓库刚刚竖起房架，就意外地收到一批由长江航运管理局运来的精密仪器。以后又收到了一些错送的机械等设备。
    眼看机械、仪器放在仓库里生锈，垫付的运费和逾期罚款也不少了，西南第一工程公司供应处从去年10月份起，先后写信和派人到有关单位了解，甚至采取“送货上门”的办法，才给一部分刨床、割线机等找到了货主。其中有的是西南工程管理总局基建处的，有的是总甲方委员会的……。但是，也有一些东西经过辗转查询，仍然没有找到物主。去年年底，仓库里还有仪器、机械等二十五箱，无人认领；账面上还有垫付的运费九千一百元，不知道归谁偿还。
    直到现在，大箱小箱的机具、仪器仍旧源源不断地运来。1月3日，他们收到“起跑器”二十箱。供应处的负责人说：“我们建筑部门怎么会订购这么多体育用品呢？这又不知道要到哪天才能物归其主了！”
