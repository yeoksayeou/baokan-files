    Why are Certain Commodities in Short Supply?
    In markets across China, a phenomenon of tight supply of certain materials has gradually emerged in recent years. Whether in large or small towns, there are several items for which people often have to queue to buy. Some commodities are frequently out of stock. How did this situation arise? It is very necessary to explain it.
    Some people say, "The tight supply of materials in the domestic market is caused by excessive exports." This statement is unfounded. Although China must export a considerable amount of materials in order to import machinery and equipment, the tight supply of materials in the domestic market is not due to limited exports. Take pork as an example. For the past seven years, China's annual pork exports have been roughly the same. In 1954, pork exports accounted for only about 3% of total hog production, equivalent to 6.8% of domestic market retail sales; in 1956, pork exports even decreased compared to 1954. Obviously, the reason for the tight supply is not caused by exports.
    Some also say, "The tight supply of materials is because production has decreased." This statement is also incorrect. China's grain production has increased year by year, and this year it has already reached the 1957 production target set by the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Taking 1950 as 100, by 1955, edible vegetable oil had increased to 191.9, and cotton cloth had increased to 179.9. Only hog production increased year by year before 1954, with the highest output reaching over 101 million heads; later, due to insufficient feed, the problems of public and private raising were not resolved in time after cooperativization, and coupled with the fact that purchase prices were too low in some areas, hog production slightly decreased, with hog production in 1955 falling to over 87.9 million heads. However, even so, it was still 14.3% more than the highest annual output before liberation (1934). This shows that production has not decreased, and the situation of supply falling short of demand is certainly not due to any reduction in production.
    Production has increased, but for a country with a population of 600 million, the current production level is still very low. For example, taking cotton cloth, China's cotton cloth production in 1955 was 1.0322 billion bolts, more than double the highest annual output before liberation (1936), but if calculated per capita, each person only had a little over 17 feet. Our Party and government are constantly striving to increase production, and that is the reason why.
    The reason why certain commodities are in short supply is neither because production has decreased, nor because of excessive exports, so what exactly is it due to? The main reason is that the rate of growth of the consumption needs of our people exceeds the rate of development of consumer goods production. Although the production of many consumer goods is growing every year, because the consumption needs of the people are growing even faster, the increased production of consumer goods still feels insufficient to meet demand. This situation reflects the fact that China's original economic foundation was very weak and cannot be completely changed in a short period of time. For example, in 1955, cotton cloth production increased by 79.9% compared to 1950, while the market sales of cotton cloth increased by 122.1% in the same period. This will inevitably lead to a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand.
    Then, does this mean that there are no shortcomings in our work? Of course not. Although we achieved great successes in production, construction, and other tasks in 1956, there were still shortcomings in certain aspects of our work. To a certain extent, it increased the degree of tight supply of materials on the market. This is mainly reflected in two aspects: On the one hand, in planning work and the implementation of plans, some disconnects have emerged. For example, in order to gradually improve the living standards of workers and staff, wages were generally increased in 1956, which was absolutely necessary. However, due to the excessive increase in the number of workers and staff at the same time, the excessive expansion of the scope of upgrading for workers and staff, and the fact that the wages of some workers and staff also increased a little too much, the increase in the purchasing power of workers and staff was somewhat larger. In 1956, agricultural cooperativization was realized nationwide. In order to consolidate the newly organized agricultural production cooperatives, the government should appropriately increase agricultural loans. However, the increase was also somewhat large, and a considerable portion of it was used to purchase consumer goods. In 1956, the vast majority of investments in capital construction and other undertakings were correct, but a small portion was spent inappropriately or excessively. All of these have created an imbalance between social purchasing power and the growth of consumer goods production, exacerbating the phenomenon of short supply of certain commodities.
    On the other hand, some inappropriate measures in commercial work are also a reason for the market situation becoming tight. For example, when there is a little more of a certain commodity, they rush to sell it on credit, demanding that industrial departments reduce production; when there is a little less of a certain commodity, they rush to buy it (especially secondary wholesale stores), and dare not release supplies (mainly grassroots stores). This shows that commercial work departments have not yet been able to conduct investigation and research work in conjunction with the overall production situation and consumption situation, and have not yet well undertaken the task of balancing the development of production and supplying the needs of the people. In specific work, shortcomings such as the untimely and inappropriate allocation of certain commodities, and the failure of varieties to fully meet the needs of residents, also need to be further improved.
    These shortcomings are completely overcomeable. However, even if these shortcomings are overcome, the supply of various daily necessities will still not be very abundant. Because we are building socialism on the basis of a backward agricultural country. China's land, averaged per capita, is only about three mu per person. It is very difficult to improve the living standards of everyone even by a little. For example, if each person eats just one or two more liang of grain per day, the whole country will consume more than 13 billion jin more per year. Just to increase this amount of grain, it is necessary to increase China's agricultural production level by about 3.5%. Although China's agricultural production increases by a larger amount than this number each year, it is not much larger. Under China's current conditions, there is a certain limit to agricultural production increases. We can only guarantee a certain degree of tense balance between national construction and the people's livelihood. The people of the whole country should have a full understanding of this basic situation.
    Under the basic condition that the needs of the people exceed the supply capacity, contradictions of mismatch between supply and demand will often occur in the market. The glorious task of commercial workers is to constantly and promptly adjust and overcome this contradiction, and try to reduce it, so that people no longer feel this contradiction. As long as commercial workers can closely rely on the masses, constantly conduct investigation and research, and patiently listen to the demands and opinions of the people, they will certainly be able to alleviate the contradiction of supply falling short of demand to a great extent.
    Of course, it is also unrealistic to demand that tens of thousands of commodities, regardless of time, place, and conditions, can be completely supplied to meet demand, without either being out of stock or overstocked. Because this is not in line with China's economic situation and the objective laws of economic development. In the stage of national socialist construction, we cannot imagine solving the problems of reasonable inventory and national reserves all at once. Overly considering national reserves will delay the speed of national industrialization. In a considerable period of time to come, we can only maintain a tense balance. Therefore, the phenomenon of temporary, local, and specific supply tensions or out-of-stocks will be unavoidable for a considerable period of time.
    The Chinese people are fighting heroically for the great cause of socialism. At this time, it is especially necessary for us to continue to carry forward the style of hard work and plain living, strive to increase production, and practice strict economy. China is a country with a population of 600 million. If everyone saves a little bit, it can solve a big problem for the country's economic construction; if everyone wastes a little bit, it can also add a lot of difficulties to the country's economic construction. For example, if we each eat one less egg per year and export these eggs, we can exchange them for 300,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, or exchange them for a complete set of machinery and equipment for four and a half thermal power plants with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts, which can supply electricity to 800,000 to 1.2 million people. From this, it can be seen that it is not very difficult for each person to save a little bit of consumer goods; it is a great contribution to national construction.

### 某些商品为何供不应求

    某些商品为何供不应求
    在我国各地市场上，近年来逐渐地出现了某些物资供应紧张的现象。不论大小城镇，有几种东西买起来常常要排队。有些商品常常脱销。这种情况是怎样产生的呢？很有加以解释的必要。
    有人说，“国内市场物资供应紧张，是外销过多造成的。”这种说法没有根据。虽然为了进口机器装备，我国必须出口相当的物资，但是国内市场物资供应紧张，却并不是由于有限的出口。以猪肉为例，七年来，我国每年出口的猪肉大体相等。1954年猪肉出口量只有生猪产量的3％左右，相当于国内市场零售量的6.8％；1956年猪肉出口量还比1954年减少了。显然，供应紧张的原因，并不是出口造成的。
    也有人说，“物资供应紧张，是因为生产减少了。”这种说法也不正确。我国粮食产量逐年增加，今年已经提前达到五年计划规定的1957年的产量指标。以1950年为一百，到1955年，食用植物油增加到一百九十一点九，棉布增加到一百七十九点九。只有生猪生产，在1954年以前逐年增加，最高产量达到一亿零一百多万头；后来由于饲料不足，合作化以后公养、私养问题没有及时解决，再加上有些地区收购价格偏低，以致生猪生产略有减少，1955年生猪产量下降到八千七百九十多万头。但是，即便是这样，还比解放前最高年（1934年）产量多14.3％。这就表明，生产并没有减少，而供不应求当然也不是由于什么生产减少。
    生产是增加了，但是对我们这样一个六万万人口的国家来说，现时的产量水平还是很低的。比方拿棉布来说，1955年我国棉布产量为一亿零三百二十二万匹，比解放前最高年（1936年）产量增加了一倍多，但是，如果按人口平均计算，每个人只有十七尺多。我们的党和政府不断努力增加生产，道理就在这里。
    某些商品供不应求，既不是因为生产减少，又不是由于出口过多，那末，究竟是因为什么呢？主要的原因，是我国人民消费需要增长的速度，超过了消费资料生产发展的速度。许多消费资料的生产虽然每年都在增长，但是，因为人民的消费需要增长得更快，所以增产了的消费品仍然感到供应不足。这种情况反映了我国原来的经济基础非常薄弱，不是短时间能够完全改变过来的。例如，1955年棉布产量比1950年增加了79.9％，同一个时期棉布市场销售量却增加了122.1％。这就必然会产生供不应求的现象。
    那末，这是不是说，我们工作中就没有任何缺点呢？当然不是这样。1956年我们虽然在生产、建设和其他各项工作中都获得了巨大成就，但在我们工作的某些方面还是有缺点的。它在一定范围内增加了市场上物资供应紧张的程度。这主要表现在两个方面：一方面，在计划工作和计划的执行上，出现了一些脱节的现象。例如，为了逐步提高职工的生活水平，1956年普遍地增加了工资，这是完全必要的。但是，由于同时过多地增加了职工，过多地扩大了职工的升级的范围，一部分职工的工资也增加得多了一些，这就使职工购买力增加的幅度大了一些。1956年全国实现了农业合作化，为了巩固新组织起来的农业生产合作社，政府应该适当地增加农业贷款。但是，增加的数字也大了一些，其中不小的一部分被用来购买生活资料。1956年在基本建设投资和其他事业开支方面，绝大部分是正确的，但也有一小部分花得不够恰当，或者花多了。所有这些，就造成了社会购买力和消费资料生产增长之间的不平衡，加重了某些商品供不应求的现象。
    另一方面，商业工作中某些措施不妥当，也是促使市场情况趋于紧张的一个原因。例如，一时某种商品多了一些，就忙着赊销，要求工业部门减产；一时某种商品少了一些，就忙着争购（尤其是二级批发商店），不敢放手供应（主要是基层商店）。这说明，商业工作部门还没有能够结合全面生产情况和消费情况进行调查研究工作，还没有很好地担负起平衡发展生产和供应人民需要的任务。在具体工作中，某些商品调拨不及时、不对路、花色品种不能完全符合居民需要的缺点，也有待进一步的改进。
    这些缺点，是完全可以克服的。但是，即使克服了这些缺点，各种日常用品的供应，还是不很宽裕。因为我们是在落后的农业国的基础上建设社会主义。我国的土地按人口平均，每人只有三亩左右。要想把每个人的生活水平都提高一点，那是很不容易的。比如，每人每天如果多吃一两粮食，全国每年就要多消费一百三十多亿斤。仅仅为了增产这份粮食，就需要把我国的农业生产水平提高3.5％左右。我国农业生产每年增加虽然比这个数目要大些，但是也大得不多。在我国目前的条件下，农业增产是有一定限度的。我们只能保证国家建设和人民生活中间一定程度的紧张的平衡。全国人民对于这种基本情况都应该有充分的了解。
    在人民的需要超过供应能力的基本情况下，市场上会经常发生供求不相适应的矛盾。商业工作者的光荣任务，就是要经常和及时地调整和克服这种矛盾，尽量使它减少，以至使人不再感觉有这种矛盾。商业工作者只要能够密切地依靠群众，经常地进行调查研究，耐心地倾听人民群众的要求和意见，就一定能够在很大程度上减轻供求不相适应的矛盾。
    当然，要求千万种商品不分时间、地点和条件，完全做到满足供应，既不脱销，又不积压，也是不现实的。因为这是不符合于我国的经济情况和客观的经济发展规律的。在国家社会主义建设阶段，我们不能设想一下子解决合理库存和国家储备问题。过多地考虑了国家储备，会延迟国家工业化的速度。我们在今后一个相当长的时期内只能保持一种紧张的平衡。因此，一时一地一物的供应紧张或脱销的现象，在一个相当长的时期内将是难免的。
    我国人民正在为社会主义的伟大事业而英勇奋斗。在这个时候，特别需要我们继续发扬艰苦朴素的作风，努力增加生产，厉行节约。我国是一个拥有六万万人口的国家，每人节约一点点，就能给国家的经济建设解决很大的问题；每人浪费一点点，也能给国家的经济建设增加很多的困难。比方，我们每人每年如果少吃一个鸡蛋，并把这些鸡蛋出口，就可以换回三十万吨化学肥料，或者换回四个半容量两万五千瓩、能供应八十到一百二十万人口用电的火力发电厂的全套机器设备。由此可见，每个人节约一点点消费品，并没有多大的困难；对于国家建设，却是很大的贡献。
