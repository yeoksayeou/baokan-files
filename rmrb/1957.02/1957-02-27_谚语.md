Proverbs

    Steal a needle when young, steal gold when old.
    If your neighbor's house is on fire, not helping is endangering yourself.
    If you want to quit drinking, soberly observe drunk people.
    Beat the drum in front of the face, don't knock the gong behind the back.
    An honest person will meet honest people, a straight road will have people walking on it.
    Three days without reading, speech becomes tasteless.
    Beating someone causes two days of worry, scolding someone causes three days of shame.
    If you are unwilling to part with golden bullets, you won't be able to shoot a phoenix.
