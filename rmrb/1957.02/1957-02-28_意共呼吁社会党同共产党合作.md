Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 27th: "Unità" published on the 19th a statement issued by the leadership of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) regarding the recently held 32nd Congress of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). The statement reiterated the call for unity among the working class and urged socialists to cooperate with communists in struggle, in parliaments at all levels, and in mass organizations, to create the fundamental conditions for Italy's shift to the left.

The statement said that the socialists affirmed that their party's merger with the Social Democratic Party could make an important contribution to enabling labor forces to lead the country. Communists do not deny that this assertion contains positive elements. Any step that can overcome division, create broader unity, and struggle for democracy and progress is a positive step forward.

The statement emphasized that the consistent action of communist and socialist workers is an invaluable asset of the Italian labor movement and a fundamental factor in promoting a truly socialist revolutionary strategy and tactics, and that the unity of the two parties is the result of their consistent cooperation in action. The PCI leadership views with concern and condemns certain tendencies that believe that, to achieve socialist unity and change the current situation, the price to be paid for certain democratic "guarantees" is to weaken the political cooperation between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, provoke disputes between the two working-class parties, and make concessions to anti-communist discrimination. This approach is, in fact, intentionally or unintentionally, a concession to conservative and reactionary groups; it will not help to accelerate the progress of workers but will only cause confusion, thereby delaying the progress of the working class.

The statement pointed out that socialists and communists have different evaluations of the situation in Hungary and of the developments in the entire communist movement after Stalin's death and the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. However, communists do not believe that accepting the communist viewpoint is a necessary condition for joint action. However, "making concessions to anti-Soviet and anti-communist forces in the hope that progress can be made in safeguarding the interests of workers and upholding socialist ideals is a harmful and dangerous mistake." The statement concluded by pointing out that there is no other way to change the current stagnation in Italy and oppose conservative and reactionary regression except by mobilizing the masses to launch correct and powerful struggles.

    意共呼吁社会党同共产党合作
    据新华社27日讯　罗马消息：“团结报”在19日刊载了意大利共产党指导部就不久前举行的意大利社会党第三十二次代表大会所发表的声明，声明再次呼吁工人阶级团结，呼吁社会党人同共产党人在斗争中、各级议会中和群众组织中进行合作，以创立意大利向左转的根本条件。
    声明说，社会党人肯定说，他们的党同社会民主党的合并能够成为促使劳工力量得以领导国家的重要贡献，共产党人绝不否认这种论断中含有积极的成分。任何步骤，只要能克服分裂、造成更广泛的团结，为民主与进步而斗争，就是具有积极意义的前进步骤。
    声明强调指出：共产党劳动者和社会党劳动者的一致行动，是意大利工人运动不可剥夺的宝贵财富，是促使社会真正走向社会主义的革命战略和战术的根本因素，而两党的团结是两党在行动中合作一致的结果。共产党指导部心怀忧虑地看待并且谴责某些倾向，这些倾向认为：要实现社会党统一、改变目前局面，就得付出的某种民主“保证”的代价是：削弱社会党同共产党的政治合作，挑起两个工人阶级政党之间的争吵，对反共歧视让步。这种作法其实是有意无意地向保守集团和反动集团让步，它丝毫也不能有助于促使劳动者加速前进，而只能造成混乱，从而延缓工人阶级的进展。
    声明指出，对匈牙利局势，对斯大林逝世以后和苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后整个共产主义运动中的发展，社会党人和共产党人的评价是不同的。但是共产党人并不以为接受共产党的意见是必要的联合行动的条件。然而，“向反苏反共让步，希望这样可以在维护劳动者利益和维护社会主义理想方面取得进展，却是一个有害的危险的错误”。声明最后指出：要改变目前意大利国内的停滞状态、反对保守和反动倒退，除发动群众起来进行正确而有力的斗争外别无他途。
