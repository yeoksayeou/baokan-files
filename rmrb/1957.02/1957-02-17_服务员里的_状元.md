    The "Top Scholar" Among Service Personnel

    Before ticket sales began each time, Wu Lianghong, a platform attendant at the Maji Railway Station in Guizhou Province, would systematically introduce the train schedule to passengers: "Passengers going to Beijing will depart today and arrive at 9:50 PM on the fourth day; it will take just over five days to reach Shenyang in Northeast China; to Shanghai, an ordinary hard seat ticket is 25 yuan and 7 jiao...." He introduced train numbers, arrival times, and fares to all major cities across the country. After the introductions, he walked through the crowd, answering the various questions raised by passengers, proactively telling first-time travelers how to buy tickets, and sometimes even drawing travel route maps for them. Passengers call him a "living timetable."

    Wu Lianghong took even more meticulous care of the elderly and children. He often said, "Everyone has parents and children. Since the country has assigned me to be a service worker, I must serve these people as if they were my own relatives." Once, he lent his quilt and blanket to an old woman who couldn't find a hotel for the night and slept in his overcoat himself. When he was working at the Jinchengjiang Station, a train attendant from a train coming from Liuzhou handed him a little girl who was only six years old. The girl's father had just passed away, and her mother worked in Nanchang and had difficulty taking care of her, so she asked the railway department to transfer her from Nanchang via Jinchengjiang by bus to her uncle's house in Guiyang. Wu Lianghong sympathized with the little girl, took her back to his dormitory, and washed her face and feet. When the child cried, he would take her to the street to buy candy or to the bridge opposite the station to look at the moon. When the child cried for her mother in the middle of the night, he took her to the station to play so as not to disturb the sleep of other comrades, until the child fell asleep. The next morning, Wu Lianghong personally took the child to the bus station and handed her over to the driver. He has taken care of unaccompanied children like this more than ten times.

    Since Wu Lianghong became a platform attendant, the station has frequently received letters from passengers praising him. From 1953 to 1955, he was named an outstanding employee in the Liuzhou Railway Bureau system every year. Last year, he was twice named an advanced worker by the Bureau. People not only call him a "living timetable" but also call him the "top scholar" among service personnel.

    服务员里的“状元”
    每逢开始售票以前，贵州省麻尾火车站站台服务员吴良鸿就向旅客系统地介绍行车情况：“到北京的旅客，今天动身，第四天的晚上九点五十分到达；到东北沈阳只要五天多的时间；到上海，普通硬席票二十五元七角……。”到全国各大城市去的车次、到达时间、票价，他都一一加以介绍。介绍完以后，他就在人群中走来走去，解答旅客们提出的各种问题，主动告诉初次出门的旅客如何买票，有时候还为他们画出旅行路线图。旅客们都称他作“活行车表”。
    吴良鸿对老年人和小孩的照顾更为周到。他常说：“谁都有父母子女，国家既然叫我当服务员，我就要像对待自己的亲人一样为这些人服务。”有一次，他把自己的被子和毯子借给一个没有找着旅馆的老太太过夜，自己就盖着大衣睡觉。他还在金城江车站工作的时候，从柳州来的列车上的乘务员，把一个仅有六岁的小姑娘交给了他。这个女孩的父亲刚刚去世，母亲在南昌工作，对她照顾有困难，就请铁路部门把她由南昌经金城江转汽车送到贵阳她舅舅家去。吴良鸿非常同情这个小女孩，把她领回自己宿舍，给她洗脸，洗脚。当这个小孩哭的时候，他就带她到街上买糖果，或者到车站对面的大桥上去看月亮。小孩睡到半夜，又哭着找妈妈，为了不影响其他同志睡眠，他又抱着小孩到车站去玩，直到小孩睡着。第二天清早，吴良鸿亲自把这个小孩送到公共汽车站，交给驾驶员。像这样照顾孤身小旅客的事，已经有十次以上。
    自从吴良鸿做站台服务员以来，车站上经常收到旅客们表扬他的信。1953年到1955年，每年他都被评为柳州铁路管理局系统的优秀职工。去年又两次被评为管理局的先进工作者。人们不仅称他作“活行车表”，还称他为“服务员里的‘状元’”呢。
