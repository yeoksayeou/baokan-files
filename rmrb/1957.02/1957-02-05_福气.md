    Fortune	Ma Tieding
    Recently, a neighbor's father came from the South and chatted with me one evening. After a bit of back and forth, I realized it was this conversation:
    Question: How much is mutton per pound here, how much is rice per pound?
    Answer: I don't know, I eat in the public canteen.
    Question: Is it expensive to take a bath?
    Answer: I don't know, we have public bathhouses.
    Question: How much is a movie ticket?
    Answer: I don't know, the organization buys them for us.
    Question: (He noticed a broken piece of glass in my window) How much is a piece of glass?
    Answer: I don't know, the public helps us repair it.
    Question: "You are really fortunate, the public takes care of you so well! ... I'm going back tomorrow, how do I buy a train ticket? Probably don't know that either..."
    I couldn't answer, nor did I want to continue the conversation. Frankly, I didn't feel ashamed at the time, just felt that talking about these things would take all night.
    Really, we more responsible "public people" living in the world, besides going to work in the office, all private matters, whether it be clothing, food, housing, transportation, entertainment, medical care, or weddings, funerals, marriages, childbirth, raising children, and education, are all "contracted" to the public. And people's private lives are so complex and meticulous, a mother's loving heart, a couple's love, a patient's sorrow, an old person's warmth, and so on, which of these isn't the public concerned with!
    Thinking about this, I suddenly felt a great sense of emotion. Because, as far as I know, such treatment hasn't satisfied some people. A portion of people (somehow, this portion seems to have expanded again last year) whose "rank" is already high, yet still strive to be promoted, whose "treatment" is already good, yet still strive to be even better, who are already "cared for" a lot, yet still strive for more, who are already riding in small cars, yet still strive for a private car; whose houses are already big enough, yet strive for even better and more houses. And so on, all sorts of insatiable demands still endlessly pour in to the public. Regarding this, I really want to choose some of the most vicious words to rebuke them.
    But then, I thought, it's really just a small portion of people's fault, and some other cadres don't have so many desires, they are working diligently, and what they enjoy hasn't exceeded the limits set by the public. To allow them to concentrate on their work, what's wrong with taking care of them a little more!
    However, right here, we run into an even more serious question. Was my embarrassment in front of that neighbor's father something to be proud of? Thus, I thought: it's precisely because the public serves us too much that we are isolated from the lives of ordinary people, and become more ignorant of the people's hardships, not knowing the price of firewood, rice, oil, and salt. This seems unimportant, but in fact, it's a manifestation of being very disconnected from the lives of the people, and if so, how can we deeply understand the people's demands? And we, these public people, aren't we working for the people? That's one. Second, precisely because of this, the number of general affairs personnel increases, administrative departments expand, increasing the state's financial expenditure, which is equal to wasting the people's blood and sweat, so what benefit does this approach have for the majority of people?
    It seems that the biggest advantage for us "public people" is handling public affairs, but there are also shortcomings. One of the shortcomings is not handling or not handling our own private affairs much, and not handling private affairs in some cases also hinders handling public affairs well.
    Here, I also feel that a portion of people's insatiable personal desires are also somewhat related to the public taking care of them too much, and to not knowing the people's hardships. We don't approve of absolute egalitarianism, but we absolutely cannot allow these people's lives to be too different from the lives of ordinary people, let alone allow them to be detached from the people! Sharing weal and woe with the people, that is our fortune!

    福气	马铁丁
    最近，有位邻居的父亲刚从南方来，在一个晚上跟我闲谈起来。一问一答，谈了好一会。回头一想，原来是这样一段对话：
    问：这里羊肉多少钱一斤，大米多少钱一斤？
    答：不知道，我是在公共食堂吃饭的。
    问：洗澡贵不贵？
    答：不知道，我们有公共澡堂。
    问：电影票多少钱一张？
    答：不知道，机关有人给买。
    问：（他见我房子窗户玻璃坏了一块）玻璃多少钱一块？
    答：不知道，公家帮我们修。
    问：“你们真有福气，公家管你们管得多周到！……我明天就回去啦，火车票怎么买法呀？大概也不清楚吧……。”
    我既不能回答，也不想再谈下去了。说实在的，我当时并不感到羞愧，只是觉到，要说这些，一晚上也谈不完。
    真的，我们这些比较负责的“公家人”活在世上，除了上班办公以外，一切私事，无论衣、食、住、行、娱乐、看病，也无论婚、丧、嫁、娶，孩子的生育、抚养和读书，全给公家“包干”了。而人的私生活又何其复杂细致，母亲的慈心，夫妻的爱情，病人的忧愁，老人的寒暖，如此等等，公家哪一样不在关心之列呢！
    想到这里，我忽然大有感触。因为，像我所知这样的待遇，还并没有使某些人得到满足。有一部分人（不知怎的，去年这一部分好像又扩大了）“级”已经很高，却还要争着往上提，“待遇”已经很好，却要争着再好，被“照顾”得已经很多，却还争着更多，已经坐上小汽车的，却还争着要专车；房子已经够住，却争着要更好更多的房子。如此等等，种种没有餍足的要求，还在无休止地向公家涌来。对于这，我真想选用一些最刻毒的字眼予以斥责。
    可是，我又一想，觉得这实在不过是一小部分人的过失，而另外的一些干部并没有这么多的欲望，他们是辛勤地工作着，他们所享受的也并未越出公家规定的界限一步。为了使他们集中精力于工作，多照顾一些又有什么不可以呢！
    然而，正在这里，恰恰碰上了一个更严重的题。我在那位邻居的父亲面前的窘态难道是什么光荣的事体吗？于是，我想到：正是公家为我们服务太多的原故，才使我们同普通人民的生活隔绝，弄得更加不知民间疾苦，柴、米、油、盐的价钱不知道。这好像不要紧，其实，正是与人民生活的情形很隔膜的表现，既如此，又怎么能够深入地理解人民的要求呢？而我们，这些公家人，不正是为人民而工作吗？这是一。第二、正因为这样，总务工作人员就增多，行政部门膨胀，加大了国家的财政支出，而这，也就等于浪费了人民的血汗，那么，这种作法，与大多数人又何益之有呢？
    看来，我们这批“公家人”的最大的好处是办公家的事，但也有缺点，缺点之一，就是不办或不大办自己的私事，而不办私事在一些情况下也就有碍于办好公事。
    这里，我又感到，一部分人的那种没有餍足的个人欲望，也多少与公家照顾得太多有关系，与不知民间疾苦有关系。我们不赞成绝对平均主义，但是也决不可以使这些人的生活与普通人民的生活相差太远，更不能让他们脱离人民！与人民共甘同苦，这才是我们的福气！
