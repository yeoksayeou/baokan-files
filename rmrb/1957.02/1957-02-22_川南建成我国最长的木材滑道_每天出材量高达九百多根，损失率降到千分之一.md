Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 21st: The Sichuan Forestry Industry Bureau pointed out in a recent summary that the Jifeng Timber Slide in the Southern Sichuan Forest Area is the longest, highest-output, and lowest-loss-rate slide in China.

    The Jifeng slide is the first timber slide built in China with reference to Soviet experience. This slide is 9,200 meters long, making it one of the longest forest area slides in the world. It is strong and durable, generally usable for about ten years without frequent maintenance; its daily timber output reaches as high as 940 logs, while the usual earth-and-wood mixed structure slide can only produce 200 logs.

    When using this slide, the workers converted the timber transfer site in the middle of the slide line into a pool by using mountain stream water, which not only reduced the number of management personnel by 70% and facilitated the classification of timber by size for continued transfer, but also reduced the timber loss rate during transportation to one in a thousand, which is more than 90% lower than the loss rate of earth-and-wood mixed structure slides.

    Because timber slides are relatively expensive, they must be built on the premise that the cutting area has a long operating time and a large transportation task to be economical. The Sichuan Forestry Industry Bureau is preparing to promote this type of slide in forest areas with suitable conditions.

### 川南建成我国最长的木材滑道  每天出材量高达九百多根，损失率降到千分之一

    川南建成我国最长的木材滑道
    每天出材量高达九百多根，损失率降到千分之一
    据新华社成都21日电　四川森林工业管理局在最近总结中指出，川南林区极峰木材滑道，是一条我国最长、出材量最高、损失率最小的滑道。
    极峰滑道是我国参考苏联经验第一次用木材修成的一条滑道。这条滑道长九千二百公尺，是世界上最长的林区滑道之一。它坚固耐久，一般可用十年左右，不需经常维修；每天出材量最高达九百四十根，而通常的土木混合结构滑道只能出二百根。
    职工们在使用这条滑道的时候，由于利用山沟水把滑道线路中间作转运木材的场地改成了水池，不但减少了管理人员70％，便于把木材的大小分类，继续转运下放，而且使木材在运输中的损失率降低到千分之一，比土木混合结构滑道的损失率要低90％以上。
    木材滑道因为造价较高，必须要在伐区经营时间长和运输任务大的前提下修建才经济。四川森林工业管理局正准备在有条件的林区推广这种滑道。
