Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 14th: Japanese Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated today in the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that, although Japan is striving to improve its self-defense forces in terms of quality, it will not adopt atomic weapons and will refuse the introduction of atomic weapons by foreign countries.

The Foreign Minister made this assurance in response to an interpellation from Socialist Party member Masaru Tsuneizumi.

Nobusuke Kishi said that Japan's defense capabilities must be modernized and should be improved in terms of quality, but the Japanese people have had a tragic experience with atomic weapons, and this aversion to atomic warfare cannot be ignored. He said that we must seize every opportunity to work to eliminate the possibility of atomic warfare existing in the world.

Director General of the Defense Agency, Akira Kotaki, also stated this morning in response to an interpellation in the House of Representatives Cabinet Committee that, due to constitutional restrictions, Japan cannot possess intercontinental missiles or weapons that threaten other countries. He also said that the Japanese government's policy is not to bring atomic warheads, atomic bombs, and hydrogen bombs into Japan.

Officials of the Japanese Defense Agency also revealed in the House of Representatives Cabinet Committee that, in addition to seven types of missiles, Japan is also requesting the United States to provide F86D all-weather aircraft, new tanks, a light cruiser, and two destroyers, and the United States has agreed to provide the destroyers.

At the same time, they reiterated that the Defense Agency's Chemical School is conducting experiments and research on poison gas and bacteriological warfare.

Vice Minister of the Defense Agency Masuhara revealed that the United States had informally requested Japan to strengthen the "Secrecy Law" after receiving American missiles.

The current "Secrecy Law" has already been criticized by Japanese public opinion as interfering with Japan's internal affairs and democratic rights.

    日本人民憎恶原子战争的情绪不容忽视
    岸信介表示拒绝运进原子武器
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本外务相岸信介今天在参议院外务委员会上说，虽然日本争取在质量上提高自卫力量，但是它不采用原子武器，并且拒绝外国运进原子武器。
    外务相是在答复社会党议员曾称益提出的质询时，作了这样的保证。
    岸信介说，日本的防御力量必须现代化，应该在质量上有所改进，但是日本人民对于原子武器有过悲惨的体验，这种憎恶原子战争的情绪是不能忽视的。他说，我们要抓住一切机会，为消除世界上存在着原子战争的可能性而努力。
    防卫厅长官小泷彬今天上午在众议院内阁委员会上答复质询时也说，由于宪法的限制，日本不能拥有洲际导弹和威胁别国的武器。他又说，日本政府的方针是不把原子弹头、原子弹和氢弹运进日本。
    日本防卫厅负责官员们在众议院内阁委员会上还透露，除了七种导弹以外，日本还在要求美国提供F86D超气候飞机、新型战车、一艘轻型巡洋舰和两艘驱逐舰，而且美国已经同意提供驱逐舰。
    同时，他们再次承认，防卫厅的化学学校正在进行毒气和细菌战的试验和研究。
    防卫厅次长增原透露，美国曾经非正式地要求日本在接受美国导弹以后加强“保密法”。
    现行的“保密法”已经被日本舆论指责为干涉日本内政和民主权利。
