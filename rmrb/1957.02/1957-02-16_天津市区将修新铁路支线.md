Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 15th. Tianjin City will construct a railway spur line encircling half of Tianjin this year. The surveying team from the Third Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, which is responsible for designing the spur line, began surveying work on the 14th.

	This railway spur line will start from Tianjin West Station on the Jinpu Railway, pass through the western suburbs, and reach the Chentangzhuang factory area on the Haihe River, with a total length of approximately 24 kilometers. It is expected to be basically completed by the end of this year. Factories and enterprises along this railway line transport nearly 1.3 million tons of materials in and out each year. In the past, because they were far from the railway, they needed to be equipped with a large number of trucks for transportation, which was costly and inefficient. After the completion of this railway spur line, it can save 2 million yuan in handling costs and the transportation capacity of more than 100 trucks each year, which will also greatly help to alleviate traffic congestion in the city.

	This railway spur line will utilize some embankment and old roadbeds for construction, requiring less national investment, and it is expected that all investment can be recovered within three to five years.

    天津市区将修新铁路支线
    新华社天津15日电　天津市今年将兴建一条环绕半个天津的铁路支线。负责设计这条支线的铁道部第三设计院的勘测队已经从14日起开始进行勘测工作。
    这条铁路支线将从津浦铁路天津西站起，经过西郊到达海河河边的陈塘庄工厂区，全长约二十四公里，预计今年年底可以基本建成。这条铁路沿线的工厂企业，每年有将近一百三十万吨的物资运进运出。过去因为离铁路较远需要配备大批汽车运输，成本既高效率又低。这条铁路支线建成以后，每年就可以节约二百万元搬运费用和一百多辆汽车的运力，对改变市内运输拥塞情况也会有很大作用。
    这条铁路支线将利用一部分堤岸和旧路基来修建，国家投资较小，预计在三、五年内就可以全部收回投资。
