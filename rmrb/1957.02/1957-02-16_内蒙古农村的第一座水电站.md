Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: The first small-scale hydroelectric power station in rural Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region – the Guantunbao Hydroelectric Power Station in Fengzhen County – has been completed. This hydroelectric power station was built by the agricultural cooperative with the help of the government and workers. This year, in addition to being used for pumping water to irrigate farmland and providing nighttime lighting, it can process 700,000 jin of grain and press 400,000 jin of oil. When the hydroelectric power station successfully generated electricity and the electric lights in the village suddenly lit up on Lunar New Year's Eve, an elderly farmer said: This spring has been flowing for hundreds of years, but only under the leadership of Chairman Mao can we utilize it and have electric lights.

The Autonomous Region's water conservancy department plans to assist farmers and herdsmen in building nine more small-scale hydroelectric power stations in rural areas and grasslands this year.

    内蒙古农村的第一座水电站
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区农村里建成了第一座小型水力发电站——丰镇县官屯堡水电站。这座水电站是政府和工人们帮助下，由农业社兴建起来的。今年除去用做提水灌溉农田和供夜晚照明外，能加工粮食七十万斤和榨油四十万斤。当水电站发电成功，村里的电灯在旧历除夕突放光明的时候，老年农民说：这股泉水不知流了几百年了，只有在毛主席的领导下，我们才能利用它，才能有了电灯。
    自治区水利部门准备今年在农村和草地协助农牧民再兴建九个小型水电站。
