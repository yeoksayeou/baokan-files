Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 31st — The captain and all twenty-six crew members of the British merchant ship "Ho Feng," which ran aground and was in distress, have been rescued by Chinese ships and transported safely to Xiamen. They are receiving excellent care regarding food and accommodation.

The British ship "Ho Feng," carrying 500 tons of fertilizer from Hong Kong to Xiamen, ran aground east of Zhenhaijiao, outside Xiamen port, at 1:20 AM on January 24th. The grounding location was at 24 degrees 16 minutes 7 seconds North latitude, and 118 degrees 8 minutes 6 seconds East longitude. After the ship sent out a distress signal, the People's Liberation Army naval forces stationed in the Xiamen area, as well as the Xiamen Port Authority and Customs, immediately dispatched ships to the rescue. When the British captain, Max, and the chief engineer, the last two to leave the ship, were rescued, the ship's hull was already listing, and most of the deck was submerged.

The "Ho Feng" is a 1,200-ton merchant ship belonging to the Hong Kong Wan Kwok Import & Export Co., Ltd. It was twice bombarded by Chiang Kai-shek's artillery from nearby Jinmen Island when entering and leaving Xiamen port last December.

The news of the ship's distress has been notified to the Hong Kong Wan Kwok Company to facilitate handling the aftermath of the incident.

    英商船触礁遇险
    我营救全体船员
    新华社福建前线31日电　触礁遇险的英国商船“和丰号”上的船长及全体二十六名船员，已经由中国的船只营救出险送到厦门。他们的饮食和住宿都受到很好的照顾。
    英船“和丰号”在载运五百吨肥田粉从香港赴厦门途中，于1月24日一时二十分在厦门港外镇海角以东触礁。触礁地点在北纬二十四度十六分七秒，东经一百一十八度八分六秒处。当船上发出呼救信号后，中国人民解放军驻厦门地区海军部队和厦门的港务局及海关立即派出船只前往抢救。在救出最后离船的英籍船长麦士和轮机长二人时，船躯已经倾斜，甲板大部已被淹没。
    “和丰号”是香港万国进出口股份有限公司的一只载重一千二百吨的商船。去年12月两次进出厦门港都遭到附近金门岛上蒋军炮兵的轰击。
    商船遇险消息已通知了香港万国公司，以便对此次事件进行善后事宜。
