Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th dispatch from TASS: The 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of the United States closed on the 12th.

Seven years have passed since the last congress, and these seven years have been an extremely difficult period in the history of the Communist Party of the United States. During this period, the reactionaries launched an anti-communist frenzy and persecuted the Communist Party. The reactionary forces failed to achieve their goal of eliminating the Communist Party of the United States, however, the party still suffered considerable losses in terms of organization. These years were basically years of economic "prosperity" in the United States, and this "prosperity" created the illusion of possible "permanent prosperity" among the ranks of the workers' movement. Under these circumstances, some Communist Party members also wavered.

Among intellectual party members, a call began to circulate demanding that the party be transformed into some kind of political association or educational association. A debate unfolded within the party, which was particularly intense in the area of eliminating the consequences of the cult of personality and recent international events. During this debate, some views with obvious revisionist overtones were exposed. The bourgeois press was already gloating over the "inevitable" split of the Communist Party.

However, the party's 16th National Congress was full of the spirit of unity, preservation, and strengthening of the Communist Party. The resolution on opposing the proposal to turn the party into an "association" is undoubtedly one of the most important resolutions of the congress. As early as during the preparation for the congress, the slogan of turning the party into an "association" was widely condemned at the state party representative conferences and grassroots organization meetings.

The congress criticized past sectarian errors, and at the same time pointed out the danger of right-leaning opportunistic tendencies that have been exposed, especially in recent months.

The congress reaffirmed that the Communist Party of the United States is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, especially the principle of proletarian international solidarity. The congress said in its resolution: "The Soviet Union, People's China, and the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe are socialist countries. In these countries, the system of capitalist exploitation has been eliminated, and the roots of poverty and fascism, war, national oppression, and racial discrimination have also been eliminated... The attitude of the Communist Party of the United States towards these countries reflects the party's loyalty to the great principle of proletarian internationalism, which has a long history in our country. This is a glorious tradition of international solidarity. The party inherits this tradition and considers it a glorious cause of its own."

The congress analyzed the modern economic situation in the United States, emphasizing the falsity of the "people's capitalism" myth and the unfounded illusion of "permanent prosperity." The congress assessed the adventurous foreign policy of the American ruling group and called for strengthening the struggle to strive for the implementation of a policy of peaceful coexistence. The congress analyzed the mistakes made by the party in the past on the Black question and formulated a program for Communist Party members to actively participate in the struggle against racial segregation and discrimination against Blacks, to strive for equal treatment for Blacks in employment and wages, to strive for the political equality of the 17 million Black residents of the United States, and a program for ideological struggle against racism. This resolution is of particular significance in the current situation of the rising struggle of Black Americans against racial discrimination.

The congress adopted a special resolution on the relationship between the Communist Party and social democrats. This resolution pointed out that the party must develop cooperation with socialists in workers' groups and movements and other mass groups and movements to establish a universal alliance against monopoly capital and achieve unified action in the struggle for peace and civil liberties. The resolution emphasized that the party cannot successfully eliminate its isolation if it does not correctly treat social democratic and reformist groups and organizations.

The congress approved a series of measures to bring the party's leadership closer to party members and the working masses. The congress decided to move the party's central organs to Chicago, the largest workers' center in the United States. The party's National Committee has been greatly expanded, and two-thirds of the members are to be elected by the state party representative conferences. The congress approved a new party constitution that strengthens intra-party democracy.

    美共代表大会充满团结和加强党的精神
    重申党忠于马克思列宁主义和国际主义原则
    批判了宗派主义的错误和右倾机会主义倾向
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约13日讯：美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会于12日闭幕。
    自上次代表大会到现在已经过去了七年，这七年是美国共产党历史上极为艰苦的时期。反动派在这一时期展开了反共狂潮，迫害共产党。反动势力没有能够达到消灭美国共产党的目的，不过，党在组织方面还是遭到了不小的损失。这些年基本上是美国经济“繁荣”的年代，这种“繁荣”在工人运动队伍中造成了可能有“永久繁荣”的幻觉。在这种情况下，某些共产党员也产生了动摇。
    在知识分子党员中开始流传一种呼声，要求把党变成某种政治协会或者教育协会。党内展开了辩论，在消除个人崇拜后果方面和最近一些国际事件方面，辩论尤其激烈。在这次辩论过程中暴露了一些带有明显的修正主义色彩的主张。资产阶级报刊已经在为共产党“不可避免”会要分裂而幸灾乐祸。
    然而党的第十六次全国代表大会却充满了团结、保存和加强共产党的精神。关于反对把党变成“协会”的主张的决议，无疑是代表大会的最重要决议之一。早在代表大会筹备期间，把党变为“协会”的口号就在各州党代表会议上和基层组织大会上受到普遍的谴责。
    代表大会批判了过去的宗派主义错误，同时指出了特别是在最近几个月内暴露出来的右倾机会主义倾向的危险。
    代表大会重申，美国共产党忠于马克思列宁主义原则，特别是无产阶级国际团结原则。代表大会在决议中说：“苏联、人民中国和东欧人民民主国家是社会主义国家。在这些国家里消灭了资本主义剥削制度，同时也消除了贫穷和法西斯主义、战争、民族压迫和种族歧视的根源……美国共产党对这些国家的态度反映了党对伟大的无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚，无产阶级国际主义在我国历史中具有悠久渊源。这是国际团结的光荣传统。党继承这种传统，并且认为这是自己的一项光荣事业”。
    代表大会分析了美国现代经济状况，强调指出“人民资本主义”神话的虚伪性，“永久繁荣”是没有根据的幻觉。代表大会对美国统治集团的冒险外交政策作了估计，号召加强斗争，争取实行和平共处政策。代表大会分析了党过去在黑人问题上犯的错误，拟定了共产党员积极参加斗争来反对对黑人实行种族隔离和歧视、争取在就业和工资方面平等对待黑人、争取美国一千七百万黑人居民的政治平等地位的纲领，以及同种族主义作思想斗争的纲领。在目前美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争高涨的情况下，这项决议具有特别重大的意义。
    代表大会通过了关于共产党对社会民主党人关系问题的特别决议。这项决议指出，党必须发展同工人团体和运动以及其它群众团体和运动中的社会主义者的合作，以建立反对垄断资本的普遍联盟，取得在争取和平和公民自由斗争中的行动一致。决议强调指出，如果不正确地对待社会民主党和改良主义集团和组织，党就不可能成功地消除自己的孤立状态。
    代表大会批准了一系列使党领导机构同党员和工人群众接近的措施。大会决定把党的中央机关迁到美国最大的工人中心——芝加哥。党全国委员会大大扩大了，并且其中有三分之二的委员要由各州党代表会议选出。代表大会批准了加强党内民主的新党章。
