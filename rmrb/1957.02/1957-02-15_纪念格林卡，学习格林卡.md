Commemorating the centenary of the death of the "Father of Russian Music" – Glinka, Chinese musicians should deeply study the rich legacy of the great master and systematically learn from the outstanding composer who enriched world musical culture.

It is simply impossible to talk about all aspects of learning from Glinka in a short article. Glinka's musical creations involve all aspects of the music culture field: his two most famous operas, one a tragic heroic epic "Ivan Susanin", and the other a comedic legend "Ruslan and Lyudmila", each has different approaches due to the different subjects. In terms of symphonic music, Glinka did not leave many works, but both "Kamarinskaya" and "Night in Madrid" are cornerstones for establishing the Russian school of symphonic music. Every chapter of Glinka's vocal works is a sparkling gem, from mournful contemplation to profound drama, from simple sketches of social customs to complex and sharp psychological depictions, almost every romance is a treasure in the world's vocal literature. Referring to his special position in Russian music history, it is enough for us to mention only one of his works. The composer himself called "Ivan Susanin" "a tragic opera of the motherland". Although it was called "coachman's music" by the Russian aristocratic dignitaries at the time, it was this opera that created the Russian school of opera. It also has special significance in opera history, in terms of both subject matter and performance techniques. It can be said that this is the first opera of the people. Therefore, Glinka is not only the founder of the Russian school in music history, but also, in that era when Romanticism was popular, he was a great master who, on the one hand, maintained a firm and objective classical tradition, and on the other hand, did not exclude or reject the romantic spirit of unconstrained imagination.

If we want to discuss Glinka's operas, orchestral music, and vocal works, as well as his special position in music history, especially in Russian music history, we need to conduct specialized academic research. Today, as Chinese musicians commemorate the immortal Glinka, I would like to raise two questions. In my opinion, these two questions are problems that urgently need to be overcome and resolved in the expressive methods of our country's music creation circles.

Learn from Glinka's highly rigorous logic in musical language, musical ideas, and musical structure.

During the mass song creation award competition held the year before last, it was statistically found that nearly 10,000 mass songs were publicly published across the country in three or four years. Many of the award-winning works were very excellent creations. However, apart from the excellent works among the award-winning works, there are very few songs that are truly loved by the masses and can be easily remembered and recited. Many people reflect that one of the reasons why many mass songs cannot be widely circulated is that these songs are not easy to remember or recite. Of course, generally speaking, these songs are not loved by the masses because they cannot centrally and vividly reflect the thoughts, feelings, and spiritual outlook of the masses' real lives. However, there are many authors who have a certain experience of the thoughts and feelings of the masses' real lives, and who can also, to a certain extent, breathe and share with the masses politically and emotionally. They also have a keen desire to express the lives and struggles of the masses, but why can't they still write songs that centrally and vividly reflect the thoughts and feelings of the masses? In my opinion, one of the important reasons is that the musical language and musical ideas lack the persuasive power and appeal of eloquence, and the musical conception lacks rigorous logic. Great poets spare no effort to polish their language, scrutinizing every word and sentence, which is also a spirit that a composer must possess. We must overcome the serious shortcomings of lacking organization and tailoring, and lacking structural and formal correspondence in song creation.

I believe that studying Glinka's rich romances, learning from the symphonic nature of Glinka's orchestral works, and studying the vast and precise conception of Glinka's operas from beginning to end will greatly benefit us. The logic of musical language, musical ideas, and musical structure is a major sign of Classicism and, it should be said, also a characteristic of Realism. Many Romantic composers often become overly immersed in subjective imagination, making their works passionate and moving in many places, but generally speaking, scattered and weak. This is also worth pondering.

Secondly, learn from Glinka's simple and unadorned characteristics in musical language, musical techniques, and musical expression.

In recent years, our country's music creation circles have also achieved great success in the adaptation of folk songs and the creation of large-scale works. However, it cannot be denied that some authors have a tendency to over-accumulate and be enthusiastic about complex techniques in harmony and orchestration. A simple folk song is arranged with overly heavy harmony, often using the form of many soloists and large choirs, which sometimes dilutes the original rich colors of the folk song. An orchestral piece, the musical ideas are not complex, and the theme is not fully developed, but a lot of effort has been put into the composition of the orchestra. We must never confuse serious technical innovation and serious creativity with aimless novelty and showing off skills. Therefore, we should welcome any serious innovation. However, completely negating traditional techniques and unilaterally pursuing novel modernist tendencies also stem from the pursuit of technique for the sake of technique. Of course, I am not saying that our country's music creation circles have already produced a systematic modernist creative ideology, I am just pointing out that simplicity is often the true color of masters, and any technique must be subordinate to the expression of the content of the artwork. Sometimes, false innovation is often a manifestation of laziness and taking shortcuts. Singing a folk song is definitely not easier than singing an operatic aria, and even a simple folk song requires the singer to have a deeper interpretation and a higher degree of skill. On the other hand, in a technically complex operatic aria, the singer can use the drama of the music itself to move the audience. Therefore, using simple and unadorned techniques to profoundly express things is precisely what can show whether the creator's foundation is solid. We see that many outstanding composers adapt folk songs, and they must start from the content and form of the folk song to find the most appropriate method of expression. Too much decoration and accumulation will only obscure the original mood and characteristics of the folk song.

We know that Glinka never misused harmony, and using no more than four-part writing even became his creative motto. But that never diminished the quality of any of his works. On the contrary, it made his works more expressive and distinctive.

Of course, I am not saying that the great Glinka only has the above two characteristics in his creation, nor am I saying that the most important problems in our country's music creation circles are only the above two problems. I am just suggesting that our country's musicians take systematically learning from Glinka as an action of commemoration on the memorial day of the great Glinka, and I offer the above two superficial thoughts for the correction of comrades in our country's music circles.

    纪念格林卡，学习格林卡
    赵沨
    纪念“俄罗斯音乐之父”——格林卡逝世一百周年，中国音乐工作者应该深入地研究伟大的大师的丰富遗产，系统地向丰富了世界音乐文化的卓越的作曲家学习。
    要想在一篇短文中，谈到学习格林卡的各个方面，这简直是不可能的。格林卡的音乐创作，涉及了音乐文化领域的各方面：他的最著名的两部歌剧，一个是悲壮的英雄史诗“伊凡·苏萨宁”，一个是喜剧的传奇“卢斯兰和柳德米拉”，由于题材的不同而手法也各异其趣。在交响乐方面，格林卡留下的著作也不多，但无论“卡玛林斯卡亚”或是“马德里之夜”，都是奠定交响乐的俄罗斯学派的基石。格林卡的声乐著作的每一篇章都是晶莹的宝玉，从悲哀的沉思到深刻的戏剧性，从白描式的世态风俗画到复杂尖锐的心理刻划，几乎每一个浪漫曲都是世界声乐文献中的瑰宝。提及他在俄罗斯音乐史上的特殊地位，我们只提及他的一个作品就足够说明了。作曲家自称为“祖国的悲壮歌剧”的“伊凡·苏萨宁”，虽然曾被当时的俄国贵族显宦们称之为“马车夫的音乐”，但也就是这部歌剧开创了歌剧的俄罗斯学派。它在歌剧史上，无论题材、表现技巧各方面，也都有着特殊的意义。可以说，这是第一部人民的歌剧。所以，格林卡不只是一个音乐史上的俄罗斯学派的创始人，在浪漫乐派风靡一时的当时，他是一方面保持着坚定、客观的古典主义传统，另一面又不排斥、拒绝那种驰骋想像的浪漫主义精神的集大成者。
    如果要讨论格林卡的歌剧、管弦乐和声乐著作以及他在音乐史上特别在俄罗斯音乐史上的特殊地位，都需要作专门的学术研究，今天，中国的音乐工作者纪念不朽的格林卡，我愿意提出两个问题来。我认为，这两个问题是我国音乐创作界在表现方法上亟待克服和解决的问题。
    学习格林卡在音乐语言、音乐意念、音乐结构上的高度严密的逻辑性。
    在前年举行群众歌曲创作评奖时，据统计，三、四年中，在全国各地公开发表的群众歌曲将近一万首。其中许多获奖的作品都是非常优秀的创作。但除获奖作品中的优秀作品外，真正为群众所喜爱，能脍炙人口被人们过目成诵的歌曲便为数极少。许多群众反映，不少的群众歌曲不能广泛流传的原因之一是这些歌曲不易记忆，不易背诵。当然，总的说，这些歌曲的不为群众喜爱是因为这些歌曲不能集中、生动地反映群众生活现实的思想情感和精神风貌。但是，有许多作者，对群众生活现实的思想情感有着一定的体验，并且也在政治上和思想情感上能和群众在一定程度上呼吸与共，他们也有着热切地表现群众生活和斗争的愿望，但为什么仍然不能写出集中、生动地反映群众的思想情感的歌曲呢？在我看，重要原因之一便是音乐语言、音乐意念缺乏雄辩的说服力和感染力，音乐构思上缺乏严密的逻辑性的原故。大诗人们对自己的语言不惜千锤百炼，一字一句之间推敲至再，这也是一个作曲家必具的精神。我们必须克服歌曲创作上缺乏组织和剪裁、缺乏结构和形式呼应这个严重的缺点。
    我认为，研究格林卡的丰富的浪漫曲，学习格林卡管弦乐著作的交响性，研究格林卡的歌剧的自始至终呵成一气的广大而精密的构思，这是会使我们获益极多的。音乐语言、音乐意念、音乐结构的逻辑性，正是古典主义的一个主要标志，应该说，也是现实主义的一个特征。许多浪漫主义的作曲家常因过于沉溺于主观想像而使作品在许多地方虽热情动人，而总体说来却涣散无力。这也是值得我们深思的。
    其次，学习格林卡在音乐语言、音乐技法、音乐表现上的单纯和质朴的特点。
    近年来，我国音乐创作界在改编民歌和大形式作品的创作上，也取得很大的成绩，但也不容隐讳，有些作者在和声、配器的技巧上有着过分堆砌和热中于繁复手法的倾向。一首质朴的民歌被配上过分浓重的和声，动辄运用许多独唱者和大合唱团的形式，有时反倒把民歌的原有的浓郁色彩给冲淡了。一首管弦乐小品，乐思并不复杂，主题也没有充分展开，但却在乐队编成上下了许多工夫。我们绝不能把认真的技法革新、严肃的创造性来和无目的的标新立异、炫耀技巧相混同。因而，对任何严正的革新都应该表示欢迎。但是，全部否定传统技法，片面追求新奇的现代主义倾向，也正是从为技巧而技巧出发的。我当然不是说我国音乐创作界已经产生了系统的现代主义创作思想，我只是指出，单纯常是大师们的本色，任何技法必须服从于对艺术品内容的表现。有时，假革新常是偷懒和取巧的表现。演唱一首民歌绝对不比演唱一首歌剧抒情调容易，甚至正是质朴的民歌需要演唱者更深刻的解释和更高度的技巧，而一首技巧复杂的歌剧抒情调，演唱者倒可以用音乐本身的戏剧性来激动听众。所以，用单纯和质朴的技法来深刻地表现事物才正是能显示创造者的工力基础深厚与否的。我们看许多杰出的作曲家改编民歌，必是从民歌的内容和形式出发，找出最适宜的表现方法，过多装饰和堆砌有时反而只会把民歌本来的情调和特点掩没了。
    我们知道格林卡从不滥用和声，少用不多于四声部的写作甚至变成了他的创作的座右铭了。但绝没有因而使他的任何一个作品因此而有所减色。相反的，倒因而使他的作品更富表现力、更有特色了。
    当然，我不是说伟大的格林卡在创作上只有上述的两个特点，我也不是说我国音乐创作界目前创作思想上最主要的问题只是上述这两个问题。我只是在伟大的格林卡的纪念日，建议我国的音乐工作者以系统地学习格林卡来作为行动的纪念。并提出以上两点粗浅的感想供我国音乐界的同志们指正。（附图片）
