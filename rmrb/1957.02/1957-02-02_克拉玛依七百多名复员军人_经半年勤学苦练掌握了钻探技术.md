Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 30th – Over seven hundred demobilized soldiers in the Karamay Oilfield have mastered petroleum drilling technology after half a year of diligent study and hard practice, becoming a new technical force. Recently, most of them have completed their planned studies and have been rated as formal drillers, rig workers, diesel engine operators, oil production workers, and other technical workers.

These demobilized soldiers worked hard in their studies and achieved excellent results. Over five hundred of them were rated as third-grade technicians when they completed their study plans and became formal workers, and some with particularly good results were rated as fourth-grade technicians. Yan Jiyi, from well team number 66, had a low level of education, was older, and did not have a good memory, which made learning very difficult. However, because he studied diligently, paying attention to recording every action of the master craftsmen, he finally mastered the rig worker and driller techniques and was rated as a third-grade technician. Chen Tianzeng, from team number 68 who was studying rig work, initially felt dizzy when he went up the derrick, but he persisted in his studies and has now become a skilled fourth-grade rig worker and has made creations in his work.

    克拉玛依七百多名复员军人
    经半年勤学苦练掌握了钻探技术
    新华社乌鲁木齐30日电　有七百多名复员军人在克拉玛依油田经过半年的勤学苦练，现在已经掌握了石油钻探技术，成为一支新生的技术力量。最近，他们大都完成了预定的学习计划，被评为正式的钻工、架工、柴油机工、采油工等各种技术工人。
    这批复员军人在学习中刻苦努力，学习成绩大都很好。有五百多人在完成学习计划转为正式工人的时候被评为三级技工，有一部分成绩特别好的，技术等级被评为四级。六十六号井队的阎积义文化水平很低，年岁也比较大，记忆力也不够好，学习上困难很多。但由于他学习认真，对老师傅的每个动作都注意记下，终于熟练地掌握了架工，钻工两套技术，被评为三级技工。六八号队学习架工的陈天增，在开始时一上钻塔架子头就发晕，但他坚持学习，现在已经成为一个技术熟练的四级架工，并且在工作上有了创造。
