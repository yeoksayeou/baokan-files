    Economic Cooperation Among Socialist Countries Expanding Year by Year
    By 1962, the Soviet Union Will Help People's Democratic Countries Build 462 Enterprises
    People's Democratic Countries Also Supply the Soviet Union with Raw Materials and Necessities and Help Build Factories
    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent, February 22) "Based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have ten years of experience in industrial construction cooperation." This was said by Smirnov, Deputy Director of the Economic Liaison Administration Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade, at a press conference on the 20th.
    He said: The economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is expanding and strengthening year by year. By 1962, the Soviet Union will help the people's democratic countries build 462 factories and enterprises, and 120 separate workshops and other technical equipment. Of these, 177 factories and enterprises and 62 separate workshops had been completed by the end of 1956. In order to help the people's democratic countries train a large number of technical personnel, the Soviet Union sent more than 14,000 experts of various kinds from 1947 to 1956 to help build factories and impart advanced technology and experience in the people's democratic countries. During the same period, the Soviet Union also received nearly 10,000 experts from the people's democratic countries for mutual learning.
    In addition to helping China build 211 factories and enterprises, and 27 separate workshops and technical equipment, the Soviet Union also helped the Democratic People's Republic of Korea build 23 enterprises and 15 separate workshop projects. Since 1955, it has been helping the Democratic Republic of Vietnam build 15 factories and enterprises and 14 workshop projects. The Soviet Union has also helped the Mongolian People's Republic build nine enterprises, including coal mines and thermal power plants. Economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Eastern European people's democratic countries is also increasingly strengthened. The Soviet Union is helping Poland build 75 factories and enterprises, hydropower stations, and nine separate workshops. It is helping Romania build 57 factories and enterprises, and 13 separate workshops and equipment. The Soviet Union is also helping Bulgaria, Albania, and Czechoslovakia build a large number of factories and enterprises.
    Smirnov said that the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in industrial construction is a completely new type of mutually beneficial and mutually supportive economic cooperation. The Soviet Union exports factory construction equipment to the people's democratic countries. The Soviet Union also imports various raw materials and necessities from the people's democratic countries. At the same time, some people's democratic countries are now also helping the Soviet Union build factories for building materials and the like.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 22nd: According to TASS, Bui Cong Tranh, Director of the Economic Committee of the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, spoke to TASS reporters about the tremendous assistance of fraternal countries to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The Soviet Union's gratuitous aid to Vietnam totals about 200 million rubles, including 170,000 tons of rice, nearly 10 million meters of cotton fabrics, 14,000 tons of mineral fertilizers, and machinery and equipment for restoring enterprises and mines.
    Bui Cong Tranh then pointed out that the Soviet Union not only helped us restore our economy, but also helped us establish the foundation of national industry. With the help of the Soviet Union, Vietnam has established mineral processing plants, several thermal power stations and other industrial enterprises, and installed radio in ten cities; two tea factories, a large machinery factory, a canned fish food company, several power stations and other enterprises are currently under construction.
    Bui Cong Tranh then talked about the tremendous assistance given to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by the People's Republic of China. He said that China provides us with a large number of different types of technical equipment, food, and industrial products. With the help of China, we have built a large match factory, two brick factories, and are planning to build a paper mill, a textile factory, and other enterprises.
    Bui Cong Tranh pointed out that the assistance of fraternal countries has helped the Vietnamese working people basically restore the national economy in a short period of time.

    社会主义国家经济合作逐年扩大
    到1962年苏联将帮助人民民主国家建起四百六十二项企业
    人民民主国家也供给苏联原料和必需品并帮助建设工厂
    本报莫斯科22日电　“在平等互利、互相帮助的基础上、苏联和各人民民主国家在工业建设方面的合作已有十年经验了。”这是苏联对外贸易部经济联络管理总局副局长斯米洛夫在20日记者招待会上说的。
    他说：苏联和各人民民主国家的经济合作逐年扩大和加强。到1962年苏联将帮助各人民民主国家建设起四百六十二项工厂企业和一百二十个单独车间与其他技术装备，其中的一百七十七项工厂企业和六十二个单独车间到1956年底已全部建成。为了帮助各人民民主国家大批培养技术人材，苏联自1947年到1956年共派出了一万四千多名各种专家，到各人民民主国家帮助建设工厂和传授先进技术和经验。同一时期，苏联还接待了来自各人民民主国家的将近一万名专家，进行相互学习。
    苏联除了帮助中国建设二百一十一个工厂企业和二十七个单独车间与技术装备外，又帮助朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建设二十三项企业和十五个单独车间工程。从1955年开始帮助越南民主共和国建设十五个工厂企业和十四个车间工程。苏联还帮助蒙古人民共和国建设煤矿、热电厂等九项企业。苏联和东欧人民民主国家经济合作也日益加强。苏联帮助波兰建设七十五项工厂企业、水电站和九个单独车间。帮助罗马尼亚建设五十七项工厂企业和十三个单独车间与装备。苏联也在帮助保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克建设大批的工厂企业。
    斯米洛夫说，苏联和各人民民主国家在工业建设方面的合作是完全新型的互利和互助的经济合作。苏联向各人民民主国家输出工厂建设装备。苏联也从各人民民主国家输入各种原料和必需品。同时，目前有些人民民主国家也帮助苏联建设建筑材料等工厂。
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社河内21日讯：越南民主共和国总理府经济委员会主任裴功澄同塔斯社记者谈到兄弟国家对越南民主共和国的巨大帮助。
    苏联方面给越南的无偿援助总值二亿卢布左右，其中包括十七万吨大米、近一千万公尺的棉织品、一万四千吨矿物肥料、恢复企业和矿井用的机器装备等。
    裴功澄接着指出，苏联不仅帮助我们恢复了经济，而且帮助我们建立了民族工业的基础。在苏联的帮助下，越南建立了选矿工厂、好几个火力发电站和其他的工业企业，在十个城市装设了无线电；现在还在建设阶段中的有两个茶叶厂、一个大型的机械工厂、制鱼罐头的食品公司、几个发电站和其他的企业。
    裴功澄随后谈到中华人民共和国给予越南民主共和国的巨大帮助。他说，中国供给我们大批种类不同的技术装备、粮食和工业品。在中国的帮助下，我们建立了一个大型的火柴厂、两个制砖厂，正计划建设一个造纸厂、一个纺织工厂和其他的企业。
