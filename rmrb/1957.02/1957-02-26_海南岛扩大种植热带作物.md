Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 25th: It is currently the coffee planting season, and commune members on Hainan Island are stepping up the transplanting of coffee seedlings.

This year, Hainan Island plans to develop a total of 170,000 mu of tropical crops including rubber, coconut, sisal hemp, coffee, oil palm, and pepper. As early as last year, counties mobilized agricultural cooperatives to reserve coconut seedlings for large-scale planting this year. State-owned tropical crop farms also cultivated a large number of sisal hemp and coffee seedlings for agricultural cooperatives starting last winter. The Hainan Administrative Office's Tropical Crop Department also sent people to Yunnan Province to transport more than 800 jin of coffee seeds.

The state has issued a large number of low-interest loans to encourage agricultural cooperatives to actively plant tropical crops.

    海南岛扩大种植热带作物
    据新华社广州25日电　目前是种植咖啡的季节，海南岛上许多农业社的社员们正在加紧移植咖啡种苗。
    今年海南岛计划发展橡胶、椰子、剑麻、咖啡、油棕和胡椒等热带作物共十七万亩。各县早在去年就发动农业社留好椰子种苗，以便今年大量种植。各国营热带作物农场也都从去年冬季开始，为农业社培育了大批的剑麻和咖啡等种苗。海南行政公署热带作物处还派人到云南省，运来了八百多斤咖啡种子。
    国家为鼓励农业社积极种植热带作物，发放了大批低利贷款。
