Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Xinhua News Agency reporters learned today from relevant departments that China's capital construction tasks in the machine manufacturing industry this year remain very large.

The focus of machine industry construction this year is on the manufacturing sectors of metallurgical, coal mining, electric power, locomotive vehicles, and other machine equipment urgently needed by the national economy, as well as the manufacturing sectors of precision instruments, heavy-duty machine tools, grinding wheels, ball bearings, etc., which are extremely weak in the machine industry. Among the projects planned for construction this year, there are more than fifty machine manufacturing plants above the quota.

Among the key construction projects this year, five are for manufacturing machines for metallurgy, coal mining, and metal mining. Among them, the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant, a large-scale plant producing complete sets of large-scale ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling equipment, will have the civil engineering construction of nine large workshops this year and will begin installing relatively complex machinery and equipment. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, which manufactures coking, forging, and lifting equipment, and the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, which produces ore crushing equipment and sintering equipment, and the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant, which manufactures coal mine washing and selection equipment and hoisting winches, will all carry out large-scale equipment installation projects this year.

More than twenty machine manufacturing plants that manufacture power generation equipment or equipment related to power generation are also included in the list of major construction projects this year. The equipment installation project of more than a dozen workshops of the Harbin Turbine Plant will be fully constructed this year. The Harbin Electric Machinery Plant, which completed the first phase of construction last year, will start the second phase of construction this year. The civil engineering of the Xi'an Power Capacitor Plant, the Harbin Electric Brush Plant, and other plants will enter the final stage this year, and a large amount of equipment will be installed.

There are four key locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing projects under construction this year, one locomotive factory and one passenger car factory are newly built projects that started construction this year. The completion of these factories will greatly improve the efficiency of railway transportation and alleviate the tense situation of railway transportation.

China's precision instrument manufacturing industry, which was extremely backward in the past, will not only expand several existing small old factories this year but also build a new type of instrument factory in Xi'an. The completion of this factory is of great significance for improving China's industrial technology level and developing scientific research work and will lay the foundation for the development of China's precision instrument manufacturing industry.

There are eight important machine tool, measuring tool, cutting tool, and grinding wheel manufacturing plants under construction this year. Among them, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, which can produce heavy-duty machine tools weighing from tens to one hundred and tens of tons, and the main plant buildings of the Zhengzhou Grinding Wheel Plant will be constructed on a large scale this year.

The main factories under construction this year also include ball bearing factories, boiler factories, petroleum machinery manufacturing factories, shipyards, tractor factories, etc. Among them, the main equipment of the Luoyang Ball Bearing Factory will be installed this year and will be basically completed. The First Tractor Factory will continue to carry out civil engineering construction this year, and the civil engineering of some major workshops will be completed this year.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th. China's machine industry department has recently adjusted the 1957 capital construction plan based on the needs of national economic development and the country's financial and material resources. It has decided to reduce or postpone some of the construction projects originally planned for construction this year to ensure the investment in key projects that the country urgently needs and to give full play to the investment effect. The adjusted capital construction plan will be submitted to the State Council for review and approval.

Among the projects to be reduced or postponed, some are because the product needs have changed and are not needed at present, or although they are needed, they can be solved by giving full play to the potential of the old factories, so there is no need to build them at present. For example, the Wuhan Boiler Plant, which was originally planned to be constructed on a large scale this year, produces boilers that are needed domestically, but the other two boiler plants can temporarily meet the domestic needs for boilers by giving full play to their potential, so the main part of this project will not be constructed this year. For the same reason, the Beijing Milling Machine Factory, which was already under construction last year, has also decided to stop construction this year; the completed parts of the factory buildings will be handed over to the old factory for utilization.

Among the projects planned for reduction or postponement this year, some are because the speed of technological transformation of various departments of the national economy has been adjusted, and the products they produce are no longer urgently needed at present, so they can be temporarily not built or postponed in order to adapt to the speed of technological transformation of various departments of the national economy. For example, the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, because China has less existing arable land, more labor, and a relative lack of steel and fuel used to manufacture and operate tractors, it will still take some time to use tractors on a large scale, so it was decided to slow down the construction speed of this factory, and postpone the construction time of a large number of equipment installation projects originally planned for this year, while the civil engineering that has already started will continue to be constructed. For the same reason, the construction project of the expanded Tianjin Tractor Factory has also been decided to be stopped.

Among the projects planned for reduction or postponement, some are less important or can be postponed in key projects. For example, the second metalworking workshop of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant was originally planned to install a large amount of equipment this year; however, considering the national investment situation, it was decided to only carry out civil engineering construction this year, and concentrate investment in the first metalworking workshop and the foundry workshop and other projects that are extremely needed for starting production, so that this year's investment can be reduced by more than 8 million yuan compared with the original plan, and it can also ensure that the first metalworking workshop is put into production more quickly.

After the adjustment of China's machine industry's capital construction plan this year, although the overall investment is slightly less than last year, the investment in some key projects urgently needed by the national economy has been guaranteed, and at the same time, the investment is used more reasonably.

    机器制造工业调整建设计划
    今年有五十多个重点工程施工
    新华社26日讯　新华社记者今天从有关部门获悉：我国机器制造工业今年的基本建设任务仍然十分巨大。
    今年机器工业建设的重点，是国民经济当前迫切需要的冶金、煤矿、电力、机车车辆等机器设备的制造部门，以及机器工业极为薄弱的精密仪表、重型工作母机、砂轮、滚珠轴承等制造部门。今年计划施工的工程中，限额以上的机器制造厂共有五十多个。
    今年施工的重点工程中，有五个是制造冶金、煤矿、金属矿山等机器的，其中，将生产全套大型炼铁、炼钢、轧钢设备的规模巨大的富拉尔基重型机器厂，今年有九个大车间的土建工程进行施工，并且将开始安装比较复杂的机器设备；制造炼焦、锻压、起重等设备的太原重型机器厂，生产矿石破碎设备和烧结设备的沈阳重型机器厂，制造煤矿洗选设备、起重卷扬设备的洛阳矿山机器厂，今年都将进行较大规模的设备安装工程的施工。
    二十多个制造发电设备或同发电有关设备的机器制造厂，也列入了今年施工的主要工程的名单。哈尔滨汽轮机厂的十多个车间的设备安装工程，今年将全面施工；在去年完成了第一期建设工程的哈尔滨电机厂，今年开始进行第二期工程的施工；西安电力电容器厂、哈尔滨电刷厂等厂的土建工程，今年都进入了收尾阶段，开始大量安装设备。
    今年施工的机车车辆制造厂重点工程有四个，其中一个机车厂和一个客车厂都是今年开始施工的新建工程。这些工厂的建成，对提高铁路运输效能、缓和铁路运输的紧张情况，将有很大作用。
    我国机器工业过去极端落后的精密仪表制造业，今年除了扩建几个原有的规模较小的老厂以外，将在西安建设一个新型仪表厂。这个厂的建成对提高我国工业技术水平和发展科学研究工作有很大意义，并且将为我国精密仪表制造业的发展奠定基础。
    今年施工的工作母机、量具刃具、砂轮等制造厂，重要的有八个。其中，能够生产重达几十吨到一百几十吨的重型工作母机的武汉重型机床厂，以及郑州砂轮厂的主厂房工程，今年将进行大规模施工。
    今年施工的主要工厂还有滚珠轴承厂、锅炉厂、石油机械制造厂、造船厂、拖拉机厂等，其中，洛阳滚珠厂的主要设备都将在今年安装。并且将基本建成；第一拖拉机厂今年继续进行土建工程的施工，其中有些主要车间的厂房土建工程，将在今年完工。
    新华社26日讯　我国机器工业部门根据国民经济发展需要和国家财力物力的情况，最近调整了1957年基本建设计划。决定削减或缓建一部分原计划在今年施工的工程项目，以保证国家当前最急需的重点工程的投资，充分发挥投资效果。调整后的基本建设计划将提交国务院审核批准。
    计划削减或缓建的工程中，有的是因为产品需要情况有了变化，当前不需要，或者虽然需要，但是可以靠老厂发挥潜力来解决，因而当前可以不必建设。如原计划今年大量施工的武汉锅炉厂，它所生产的锅炉虽然国内需要，但是其他两个锅炉厂充分发挥潜力，暂时可以满足国内对锅炉的需要，因此这个工程的主要部分今年不进行施工。由于同样原因，去年已经施工的北京铣床厂，今年也决定停止施工；已经建成的部分厂房将交老厂加以利用。
    今年计划削减或推迟的工程中，有的是由于国民经济各部门技术改造的速度有了调整，它们所生产的产品已经不是当前十分迫切需要的，因此可以暂时不建或缓建，以便同国民经济各部门技术改造的速度相适应。如第一拖拉机制造厂，由于我国现有耕地少、劳动力多、制造和开动拖拉机所用的钢铁、燃料目前又较缺乏，大量地使用拖拉机还需要一定时间，因此决定放慢这个厂的建厂速度，把原计划今年进行的大量设备安装工程的施工时间向后推迟，而已经动工的土建工程继续施工。由于同样原因，扩建的天津拖拉机厂的建厂工程，也决定停止建设。
    计划削减或推迟的工程中，有的是重点工程中比较次要的或者是可以缓建的项目。如武汉重型机床厂第二金工车间，原计划今年大量安装设备；但是考虑到国家投资情况，决定今年只进行土建工程施工，而集中投资建设对开工生产极为需要的第一金工车间和铸造车间等工程，这样今年的投资可以比原计划减少八百多万元，还可以保证第一金工车间更快地投入生产。
    我国机器工业今年的基本建设计划经过调整以后，整个投资比去年虽然略有减少，但是国民经济当前迫切需要的一些重点工程的投资，都有了保证，同时也使投资使用得更加合理。
