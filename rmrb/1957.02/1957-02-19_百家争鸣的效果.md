Title: The Effects of Letting a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend

A friend told me: Not long ago, at a conference of biologists discussing genetics, a debate arose between the Morgan school and the Michurin school. During the speeches, the majority favored Morganism, and many mentioned a professor present, saying he was an authority on the Morgan school, hoping to hear his opinion. Later, the professor spoke, but to the surprise of the entire audience, he agreed with the basic viewpoints of Michurin, and based on the results of his own years of research, he launched a "counter-attack," sharply criticizing the Morgan theory.

This matter, taken as a story, is merely interesting. But I think it reflects the positive effects of the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend and has very important significance. It is conceivable that without the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, the supporters of Morganism might not have been willing to so clearly express their academic position. Similarly, without the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, that professor who had transformed from a believer in Morgan to a critic of Morgan might have been misunderstood by some people as "dishonest."

Now, everyone is open and honest without any reservations; therefore, everyone also believes that the other is honest. This spirit is extremely important for academic discussions. Academic research is about pursuing truth; the most important thing for those who pursue truth is to be honest first, regardless of the reasons or motives.

When I told this story to another friend, that friend said that such a thing was not unique. He said that in the early days of liberation, in the biology department of a university, an old professor began to study the Michurin theory and agreed with it, so he wanted to offer a course to introduce this theory. Most of the professors in the department, however, adopted a lukewarm attitude towards this. But the school leaders at that time were a bit "leftist," impatient and rash, and strongly supported this matter, organizing party members and Communist Youth League members to vigorously strive for the opportunity to introduce the Michurin theory, and inevitably crudely criticized Morganism. This stimulated another professor, who was a Morganist. He felt that it was impossible to remain indifferent to Michurin, so he also began to study Michurin, his original intention being to understand the "enemy's situation," to find the faults of the Michurin theory and strike at it. He started attacking it several times, causing heated debate. But over time, the more he understood the "enemy's situation," the more this professor was captured by Michurin's ideas, and his own inherent views were transformed to the opposite. It was truly a case of "no acquaintance without a fight."

Both of these things happened in the field of biology. But I guess that in various scientific departments, such things are not uncommon.

If such a thing is normal, then the key, I think, lies in being able to pay attention to theories with opposing viewpoints, rather than ignoring them.

Now, Morganists and idealists have the legal right to speak and are being paid attention to, so they feel that the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is very correct. But, do Michurinists and dialectical materialists not feel the same way! It was a very difficult process for Michurinists to gain the right to speak on the podiums of many universities. Even for dialectical materialists, in the early days of liberation, for political reasons, in many environments, they could talk as much as they wanted, but in reality, what did the listeners think? Many thought it was "political propaganda" and had no academic value, just sneering and ignoring it. Such a right to speak was really not very useful. To be fair, in the past, some Marxists, whenever they encountered non-Marxist theories, would only say they were "idealistic" and "reactionary" and ignore them; this was indeed crude and simplistic. However, some non-Marxists, whenever they encountered Marxist theories, would only say they were "political propaganda" and also ignore them; this was also inevitably cold and simplistic.

Another positive effect of the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is that people with opposing views have begun to pay attention to each other. Wang Chong said: "When two blades rub against each other, the sharpness is known; when two theories are discussed, right and wrong are seen." This "discussion" is extremely important. Through "discussion," it becomes possible not only to mutually discover and criticize what is wrong, but also to mutually discover and affirm what is right, which will make the truth more and more clear, more abundant, and more perfect; only then will there be a conclusion, and the academic world will be truly lively, and it will be able to become more and more united. In fact, even if it is entirely for the purpose of defeating the opponent, one must deeply understand the opponent's arguments, as Lu Xun had long ago compared it: Heracles, in order to strangle Antaeus, tightly embraced him.

Last year, an old professor who studies classical Chinese literature chatted with me. He said, "After learning about the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, he believed that the academic world would become lively; however, lively does not mean that everyone is singing their own tune, making a chaotic noise, but that they should sing in a way that gradually becomes harmonious, and finally sing a tune." He also said: "In the past, some people only allowed themselves to speak and did not allow everyone to speak. As a result, everyone did not speak, but they did not pay attention to his words either, and his words did not produce any effect. This is the state of 'one bird singing alone makes the mountain even more secluded' and 'one bird not singing makes the mountain even more secluded.' Now, everyone is singing, but, as the ancient poem says: 'Cicadas chirping make the forest even more quiet, birds singing make the mountain even more secluded,' there is such a realm. If letting a hundred schools of thought contend is not done properly, it will be very lively on the surface; in reality, it will only make people hear a cacophony of noise, and the voice of truth will become even more subtle."

I think this old professor's words are very meaningful.

    百家争鸣的效果
    弗先
    一位朋友告诉我：不久以前，在一次生物学家的会议上，讨论遗传学的问题，发生了摩尔根学派和米丘林学派的争论。在发言中，拥护摩尔根主义的比较占多数，而且许多人都提到在场的一位教授，说他是摩尔根学派的权威，希望听听他的意见。后来，这位教授发言了，但出于全场的意外，他赞成米丘林的基本观点，而且根据他自己多年研究的结果，“反戈一击”，对摩尔根学说进行了尖锐的批判。
    这事情，当作一个故事看，只是有趣而已。但我觉得，这里面，反映了百家争鸣政策的积极效果，有很重要的意义。可以设想，假如没有百家争鸣的政策，摩尔根主义的拥护者，未必愿意这样显明地表示自己的学术上的立场；同样，假如没有百家争鸣的政策，那位由摩尔根的信徒转变为摩尔根的批判者的教授，可能被有些人们误会为“不老实”的。
    现在是，大家毫无顾虑，开诚相见了；从而，大家也就相信对方是老实的了。这种精神，对于学术讨论是极其重要的。学术研究是追求真理的；追求真理的人，最忌的首先是不老实，不管由于什么原因和动机。
    当我把这故事告诉另一位朋友时，那朋友说，这事竟是无独有偶的。他说，解放初期，在一个大学的生物系里，有一位老教授开始学习米丘林学说，而且赞成了它，于是想开一门课，介绍这学说。系内的多数教授，对此却采取了冷淡的态度。但那时的学校领导人，有点“左”，急躁冒进，大力支持这事，组织了党团员，大张旗鼓地给米丘林学说争取了介绍的机会，而且不免粗暴地批判了摩尔根主义。这就刺激了另一位教授，他是摩尔根主义者，他觉得冷淡米丘林是冷淡不下去了，于是他也研究起米丘林来，其本意却是了解“敌情”，要找米丘林学说的错处，给以打击。开始打击了好几回，引起了热烈的论争。但久而久之，愈多了解“敌情”的结果，这位教授，却被米丘林的思想所掌握住了，他自己的固有观点，向对立面转化了。真是所谓“不打不成相识”。
    这两件事，都出在生物学界。但我猜想起来，在各个科学部门内，这样的事是不会少的。
    这种事情如果是正常的，那么，其关键，我以为，在于对观点相反的学说能够理睬，而不是置之不理。
    现在是，摩尔根主义者和唯心主义者有合法的发言权了，被理睬了，所以他们觉得百家争鸣的政策十分正确。但是，米丘林主义者和辩证唯物主义者，何尝没有同感！米丘林主义者在许多大学的讲坛上争取到发言权，是有一个很困难的过程的。就是辩证唯物主义者，解放初期，由于政治的原因，在许多环境里，讲是可以大讲特讲的，但实际上，听的人怎么样？很多认为这是“政治宣传”，没有学术价值，冷笑而已，置之不理。这样的发言权，实在也不是很受用的。平心而论，过去有些马克思主义者，一逢非马克思主义的学说，就只说是“唯心”、“反动”，不予理睬；这固然是粗暴而简单。但是，有些非马克思主义者，一逢马克思主义的理论，就只说是“政治宣传”，也不予理睬；这也未免冷淡而简单。
    百家争鸣政策的又一积极效果是，持有相反观点的人们互相理睬起来了。王充说过：“两刃相割，利钝乃知；二论相订，是非乃见”。这相“订”，是十分重要的。相“订”，就会不但可能互相发现、批判其非，而且也能互相发现、肯定其是，这就会使真理愈来愈显明，愈丰富，愈臻完善；这才算有个结论，学术界也才算真正是热闹，也才能愈来愈团结。其实，就是完全为了打倒论敌，也必须深知对方的论点，如鲁迅早就比喻过的：海尔库利斯为了要扼杀安泰，就紧紧地拥抱住他。
    去年，一位研究中国古典文学的老教授同我闲谈。他说，“在学习了百家争鸣的政策之后，他相信学术界要热闹起来了；但是，热闹并不是各鸣各的，乱鸣一气，而要鸣得渐趋和谐，终于鸣出一个曲子来。”他又说：“在过去，有的人，只许自己说话，不许大家发言，结果是，大家不说话，但也并不理会他的话，他的话说了也就不产生什么效果。这是一鸟独鸣山更幽和一鸟不鸣山更幽的状态。现在是，大家鸣起来了，但是，古诗上说：蝉噪林逾静，鸟鸣山更幽，是有这境界的。百家争鸣得不对头，表面上是很热闹了；实际上，使人只听见一片噪音，而真理之声，倒会更幽微的。”
    这位老教授的话，我觉得很有意思。
