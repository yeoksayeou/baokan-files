    Strive for a Bumper Harvest in the Fortieth Year of the October Revolution
    Soviet Rural Areas Vigorously Prepare for Spring Plowing
    More Tractors and Agricultural Machinery Will Be Obtained This Year
    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent, February 23) Soviet rural areas are nearing completion in their preparations for spring plowing. Collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations in various regions are actively welcoming spring plowing in order to strive for a bumper harvest in the fortieth year of the October Revolution. As of February 20, 89% of tractor stations and 93% of state farms throughout the Soviet Union had completed their tractor repair plans; Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldavia, Armenia, and Georgia are in the lead. The Don River region had already repaired agricultural machinery and implements by February 20. Most of the seeds prepared by Ukrainian collective farms are selected high-grade varieties. Almost all of the seeds prepared by Moldavia, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Armenia are high-grade varieties. Many places in the non-black soil region are paying attention to preparing fertilizer. Collective farms in the Moscow region transported more than 800,000 tons of manure and more than 500,000 tons of peat to the fields in January and the first half of February.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 22) Factories under the Soviet Ministry of Tractor and Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing will manufacture 154,000 tractors for agriculture this year. This output is 17,500 units more than last year.
    Tractor manufacturing plants across the Soviet Union will manufacture many new types of more efficient tractors this year. Currently, about 30 types of new general-purpose diesel tractors and crawler tractors are being manufactured in various regions, some of which are already in mass production. These new tractors have 28, 38, 40 to 60 horsepower, are highly efficient, and are more convenient to use than ordinary old-style tractors.
    While tractor production increases, Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing plants will also manufacture 126,000 grain drills, 140,000 grain cultivators, 123,000 tractor-drawn plows, and a large number of other agricultural machines and implements this year.

    争取十月革命第四十年的丰收
    苏联农村大力准备春耕
    今年将获得更多的拖拉机和农业机器
    本报莫斯科23日电　苏联农村准备春耕的工作日益接近完成。各地集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的劳动者都为了争取十月革命第四十年的丰收，在积极迎接春耕。到2月20日止，全苏已有89％的拖拉机站和93％的国营农场完成了拖拉机的修理计划；乌克兰、哈萨克斯坦、摩尔达维亚、阿尔明尼亚、格鲁吉亚走在前面。顿河流域在2月20日已经修理好农业机器和器具。乌克兰集体农庄准备的种籽中大部分是选过的高级品种。摩尔达维亚、格鲁吉亚、塔吉克斯坦、阿尔明尼亚准备的几乎全是高级品种。非黑土地带的许多地方注意准备肥料。莫斯科州集体农庄在1月和2月上半月把八十多万吨粪和五十多万吨泥炭送到了田间。
    据新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联拖拉机和农业机器制造部所属各工厂今年将为农业制造十五万四千台拖拉机。这个产量比去年多一万七千五百台。
    苏联各地拖拉机制造厂今年将制造许多新型的效力更高的拖拉机。目前，各地正在制造的一般用新型的柴油拖拉机和履带拖拉机就有约三十种，其中有的已经大量生产。这些新式拖拉机有二十八、三十八、四十到六十匹马力，效率高而且使用起来也较一般旧式拖拉机方便。
    和拖拉机产量增加的同时，苏联农业机器制造厂今年还将制造十二万六千台谷物播种机、十四万台谷物中耕机、十二万三千架拖拉机曳引犁以及大量其他农业机器和农具。
