Xinhua News Agency, Madrid: Two million workers and citizens in Madrid, the capital of Spain, boycotted public transportation on the 7th and 8th to protest the rising cost of living. This is another large-scale protest action by the Spanish people following the boycott of public transportation by 2.5 million citizens in Barcelona on January 14th of this year. The Barcelona citizens' boycott was also to protest the rising cost of living.

These past two days, in the suburbs where working people live, people have continued to refrain from taking buses, trams, and subways, and instead walk to work.

According to Western news agencies, about a week ago, many leaflets appeared on the streets of Madrid, calling on citizens to boycott public transportation on the 7th and 8th to protest "the suffering caused by the Franco regime."

At the same time, thousands of university students in Madrid held demonstrations to protest the rising cost of living and to support the Madrid workers' and citizens' boycott of public transportation.

Franco's police used batons to disperse the demonstrating students, and clashes occurred. At least four students were arrested in the clashes, and some students suffered head injuries.

Meanwhile, the Barcelona residents' movement to boycott public transportation is still ongoing. The citizens of this city have not been taking trams for two weeks. University students here are also actively participating in the boycott and demonstrations.

    马德里和巴塞罗那数百万居民
    抗议佛朗哥政权造成的苦难
    据新华社讯　马德里消息：西班牙首都马德里的职工和市民二百万人在七、八两日抵制市内公共交通工具，抗议生活费用上涨。这是西班牙人民继今年1月14日巴塞罗那二百五十万市民抵制公共交通工具之后的又一大规模抗议行动。巴塞罗那市民的那一次抵制也是为了表示抗议生活费用上涨。
    这两天，在劳动人民居住的郊区，人们继续不乘坐公共汽车、电车、地下电车，而徒步前去工作。
    据西方通讯社报道，大约在一个星期以前，马德里街头出现了许多传单，号召市民们在7日和8日两天抵制公共交通工具，抗议“佛朗哥政权造成的苦难”。
    同时，马德里成千名大学生也举行示威，抗议生活费用的上涨，支持马德里职工和市民对市内公共交通工具的抵制。
    佛朗哥的警察用警棍来驱散示威的学生，和学生发生了冲突。在冲突中至少有四名学生被捕，有一些学生头部受伤。
    同时，巴塞罗那居民抵制公共交通工具的运动仍在继续中。这座城市的市民已有两个星期不乘坐电车。这里的大学生也积极参加了抵制和示威。
