Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 6th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the Central Committee delegations of the Polish United Workers' Party and the French Communist Party, after holding talks here from January 27th to February 2nd, issued a joint statement.

The statement pointed out that the easing of the international situation, achieved due to the peace aspirations of the people of all countries and the correct policies of the socialist camp, has recently been undermined by the activities of imperialist forces. The aim of imperialist forces is to intensify international tensions, maintain or restore colonial rule over the peoples of Asia and Africa, and create discord among the countries of the socialist camp. The recent aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel eloquently demonstrates this intention.

After the failure of imperialist aggression in the Middle East, U.S. imperialism formulated a plan to interfere in the affairs of this region. This plan is not only a threat to the independence of the peoples of the Middle East and Near East but also a threat to world security.

The statement said that the colonial war waged by the French government against the Algerian people violates both the interests of the Algerian people and the interests of the French people. Recognizing the Algerian people's right to independence is an indispensable condition for a peaceful solution to this problem.

The statement, in referring to the plans of imperialism to revive militarism in West Germany and equip it with atomic weapons, pointed out that this poses a serious threat to Germany's neighboring countries and to peace. The two party delegations believe that the struggle against German militarism and against the so-called Europeanization plan is a common task of immeasurable importance to the Polish and French peoples. The French Communist Party and the French working class unreservedly support Poland's Oder-Neisse border, which is a border of European peace.

The two parties support the struggle of the German Democratic Republic for a unified, peaceful Germany, and support the heroic struggle of the German Communist Party and the peaceful democratic forces in West Germany.

The statement said that all peace forces in France and Poland must intensify the struggle to reach an international agreement on universal disarmament.

The statement said that after exchanging views on the Hungarian events, the Polish United Workers' Party and the French Communist Party expressed their support for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, as well as their declared program of building socialism and reforming political and economic life.

The statement emphasized that the friendship and growing solidarity and cooperation of all socialist countries and all communist and workers' parties, linked by proletarian internationalism and ideological unity of purpose, is one of the decisive factors in the struggle of the working class in capitalist countries against exploitation, and also in the efforts of socialist countries to build a new life and in the struggle to safeguard and consolidate world peace.

The statement said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the first party to successfully realize the socialist revolution, paved the way for the establishment of a new type of workers' party. Its history and activities constitute the richest treasure trove of experience for the entire international working-class movement.

The statement pointed out that the 20th Congress of the CPSU created conditions for fully respecting Leninist principles in cooperation among socialist countries and among communist and workers' parties of all countries. These principles are equality, non-interference in internal affairs, and mutual assistance, and exchanging the experience of the peoples of each country in realizing their own path of building socialism. There is only one essence of this socialism, namely the revolutionary transformation of production relations under the political leadership of the working class.

The statement then pointed out that the two party delegations attached great importance to the criticism made by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the errors in the cult of personality, and emphasized that Leninist principles must be strictly observed in the life of the party and in inner-party democracy. The two parties oppose all attempts to use this fair criticism to spread doubts about the basic principles of the class struggle and the indispensable unity of the party ranks. Friendly party criticism based on the above principles can greatly help the struggle of communist and workers' parties of all countries to build socialism.

The statement said that communist and workers' parties, in their activities and their mutual relations, should always be faithful to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, should be vigilant in preventing any revisionist tendencies, especially attempts to blur the essence of the class struggle, and at the same time should prevent all ideas that attempt to narrow the scope of theory, because theory is not a dogma but a living science and a pointer for action. Communist and workers' parties should wage an unremitting struggle against the influence of reactionary ideologies in the consciousness of a part of the working masses, especially against chauvinism, nationalism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Soviet sentiment.

The statement said that the Polish United Workers' Party supports the unyielding struggle of the French Communist Party and the French working class for socialism, for the unity of all national and democratic forces, for the interests of the working masses and against fascism, for peace, for the rights of the Algerian people, and for the right to self-determination of all oppressed nations.

The statement continued by saying that the French Communist Party delegation congratulates the Polish United Workers' Party, the leading force of the Polish National Unity Front, on the great victory it achieved in the January 20th election. The results of this election show the Polish people's trust in socialism, which guarantees national independence and development, and show the Polish people's determination to maintain peace and maintain friendship with the peoples of all countries around the world. The French Communist Party delegation assures the Polish United Workers' Party that the French Communist Party will definitely support the efforts of the Polish United Workers' Party to consolidate socialism in Poland on the basis of Leninist principles.

The statement concluded by saying that the talks conducted by the two party delegations have helped to clarify many issues and enhance the mutual understanding necessary for cooperation between the two parties. The Polish United Workers' Party and the French Communist Party, guided by the principles of proletarian internationalism in their mutual relations, have decided to continue to maintain and strengthen cooperation in various forms for the benefit of the working people of both countries, for the continuous strengthening of Polish-French friendship, and for peace and socialism.

    波法两党发表会谈联合声明
    继续保持和加强两党合作
    反对德国军国主义和“欧洲化”计划是两国人民共同任务
    新华社华沙6日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰统一工人党中央委员会代表团和法国共产党中央委员会代表团在从1月27日到2月2日在这里举行了会谈以后，发表了联合声明。
    声明指出，由于各国人民的和平愿望和社会主义阵营国家的正确政策而取得的国际局势的和缓，最近遭到帝国主义势力活动的破坏。帝国主义势力的目的是要加剧国际紧张局势，保持或恢复对亚非各国人民的殖民统治，在社会主义阵营国家之间制造不和。英、法、以色列最近对埃及的侵略雄辩地说明了这种意图。
    帝国主义在中东的侵略失败以后美帝国主义制订了干涉这个地区的事务的计划。这种计划不仅是对中东、近东各国人民独立的威胁，而且也是对世界安全的威胁。
    声明说，法国政府对阿尔及利亚人民进行的殖民战争，既违反阿尔及利亚人民的利益，也违反法国人民的利益。承认阿尔及利亚人民独立的权利是和平解决这个问题的不可缺少的条件。
    声明在谈到帝国主义在西德复活军国主义和用原子武器把它装备起来的计划时指出，这造成了对德国各邻国以及对和平的严重威胁。两党代表团认为，反对德国军国主义和反对所谓欧洲化计划的斗争是对波法两国人民具有不可估量的重要性的共同任务。法国共产党和法国工人阶级毫无保留地支持波兰的奥得—尼斯边界，这是欧洲和平的边界。
    两党支持德意志民主共和国为实现统一、和平的德国而进行的斗争，支持德国共产党和西德的和平民主力量所进行的英勇斗争。
    声明说，法国和波兰的一切和平力量必须加紧争取达成关于普遍裁军的国际协议的斗争。
    声明说，波兰统一工人党和法国共产党在交换了关于匈牙利事件的意见以后，表示支持匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利工农革命政府以及它们所宣布的建设社会主义和革新政治、经济生活的纲领。
    声明强调指出，由无产阶级国际主义和思想上的目的一致性所联系起来的一切社会主义国家和一切共产党、工人党的友谊和日益增长的团结合作，是资本主义国家工人阶级在反对剥削斗争中的决定性因素之一，也是社会主义国家在建设新生活的努力和争取维护及巩固世界和平的斗争中的决定性因素之一。
    声明说，第一个胜利实现社会主义革命的政党苏联共产党为建立新型工人政党铺平了道路。它的历史和活动构成了整个国际工人阶级运动的最丰富的经验宝库。
    声明指出，苏共第二十次代表大会为在社会主义国家之间和各国共产党、工人党之间的合作当中充分尊重列宁主义原则创造了条件。这些原则是平等、互不干涉内政以及互相帮助、交流各国人民在实现自己的建设社会主义的道路方面的经验。这种社会主义的实质只有一个，即在工人阶级的政治领导下实现生产关系的革命转变。
    声明接着指出，两党代表团极为重视苏联共产党对于在个人崇拜方面的错误所进行的批评，并且强调在党的生活和党内民主方面必须严格遵守列宁主义原则。两党反对利用这种公正的批评而对阶级斗争的基本原则和党的队伍的不可缺少的团结散布怀疑情绪的一切尝试。依据上述原则而进行的友好的党的批评对于各国共产党、工人党为建立社会主义而进行的斗争，能够有很大的帮助。
    声明说，共产党、工人党在它们的活动和它们的相互关系中，应当始终忠实于马克思列宁主义的原则，应该警惕防止任何修正主义的倾向，特别是要防止以模糊阶级斗争本质为目的的企图，同时也要防止一切企图缩小理论的范围的想法，因为理论不是教条，而是活的科学和行动的指针。共产党、工人党应当对一部分工人群众意识中的反动观念形态的影响进行不懈的斗争，特别是对沙文主义、民族主义、排犹主义和反苏情绪进行斗争。
    声明说，波兰统一工人党支持法国共产党和法国工人阶级为社会主义、为一切民族、民主力量的团结、为工人群众的利益和反对法西斯主义、为和平、为阿尔及利亚人民的权利和一切被压迫民族的自决权利而进行的不屈不挠的斗争。
    声明接着说，法国共产党代表团祝贺波兰全国统一阵线的领导力量波兰统一工人党在1月20日的选举中所取得的伟大胜利。这次选举的结果表明了波兰人民对于保证国家独立和发展的社会主义的信任，表明了波兰人民维护和平和保持同全世界各国人民的友谊的决心。法国共产党代表团向波兰统一工人党保证，法国共产党一定支持波兰统一工人党为在列宁主义原则的基础上巩固波兰的社会主义而进行的努力。
    声明最后说，两党代表团所进行的会谈已经有助于澄清许多问题和增进为两党合作所必需的相互了解。波兰统一工人党和法国共产党在相互关系中以无产阶级国际主义的原则为指导方针，两党为了两国劳动群众的利益，为了不断加强波法友谊，为了和平和社会主义，决定继续保持和加强各种形式的合作。
