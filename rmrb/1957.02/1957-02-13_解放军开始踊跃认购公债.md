    解放军开始踊跃认购公债
    新华社12日讯　中国人民解放军许多机关、部队的广大军官和其他工薪制人员，开始踊跃认购1957年国家经济建设公债。到11日止，总后勤部已有七个单位认购完毕，认购款数超过计划数字38％。总政治部的六个单位、工程兵司令部的十个单位和防空军政治部的许多单位，也都在最近先后超额完成了认购任务。海军领导机关各部门认购公债的活动春节前就先后开始了，认购款数都超过计划认购的数字。公安军政治部和干部部的军官也在最近踊跃认购了公债。
    今年许多机关、部队认购公债的工作都进行得很早、很快。某军医院五官科的全体工作人员在报上看到国家发行1957年经济建设公债的消息后，立即主动地认购了五百七十五元，比他们去年认购的还多。某部队的军官们在一次动员会上当场认购完毕，超过他们原来计划认购数字的27％强。某部全体军官在半小时内就超额完成了认购任务。某部生活一向俭朴的瞿象富大尉，认购了六百元公债，并且一次交款四百元。为了支援国家建设，许多军官和职工订了勤俭持家的节约计划或推迟购买手表或非迫切需要的用品的日期，省下钱来购买公债。
