    The First Aluminum Plant About to Be Completed
    Czechoslovakia will soon have its own aluminum production. The construction of the first aluminum plant in Czechoslovakia, which began near Žiar nad Hronom two years ago, is now progressing rapidly. The main construction will be completed this year, allowing for trial production, with large-scale production scheduled to begin next year. It is estimated that by 1960, Czechoslovakia will produce 56,000 tons of aluminum annually, which will fully meet domestic needs. Previously, Czechoslovakia had been importing aluminum from abroad to meet its demand.
    Caring for the Education of Young People
    Recently, the issue of children's education and extracurricular activities has garnered widespread attention from schools, families, youth organizations, and trade unions in Czechoslovakia. At the initiative of the Education Workers' Union and the Czechoslovak Youth League, a special conference was held in Prague to discuss this issue.
    Several people spoke at the meeting, citing numerous figures and facts, not only exchanging opinions but also sharing experiences in educating children. The topics discussed included: how to rationally arrange students' homework to avoid overburdening them; after-school care for children; cooperation between teachers and Young Pioneer organizations; and the assistance that trade union organizations need to provide in this regard.
    Similar meetings have also been held in some factories and enterprises. They play an important role in improving children's education.
    Good News for Moviegoers
    Twenty new domestic films will be released on Czechoslovak screens this year, including a color film adapted from the world-famous Czechoslovak novel "The Good Soldier Švejk." Several of the new films are being made in collaboration with foreign filmmakers, such as "A Love Story," co-produced with Bulgaria and adapted from the play of the same name by Turkish writer Hikmet. The film "Class 1921," co-produced with the German Democratic Republic, depicts the story of a young Czech who was taken to Germany during the war to perform forced labor. A film in collaboration with French screenwriter Jacques Rémy will depict the story of French soldiers participating in the 1944 Slovak National Uprising. (Chen)

    在捷克斯洛伐克共和国
    第一个制铝厂就要建成
    不久的将来捷克斯洛伐克就将有本国出产的铝了。二年前在捷克斯洛伐克齐亚尔地方附近开工兴建的第一个制铝工厂的建设工程，现在正在迅速进行中。主要工程在今年建成后就可以试行生产，明年起就要开始大规模的生产。据估计，到1960年时，捷克斯洛伐克将每年生产五万六千吨铝，这个数目可以完全满足本国的需要，而过去捷克斯洛伐克一向是从国外进口铝来供应本国需求的。
    关怀青少年的教育
    最近一个时期来，关于孩子们的教育和课外活动的问题，引起了捷克斯洛伐克的学校、家庭、青年组织和工会的广泛注意。在教育工作者工会和捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟的发起下，曾经在布拉格召开了讨论这个问题的专门会议。
    会上有好几个人发了言，他们列举了许多数字和事实，不但交换了意见，而且也交流了培养儿童的经验。讨论的问题有：如何合理地安排学生的作业，以免负担过重；放学后对儿童的照顾；教师和少先队组织的合作，以及工会组织在这方面需要提供的帮助等。
    类似这样的会议也曾在一些工厂企业举行。它们对改进儿童教育工作有重要的作用。
    电影观众的好消息
    在捷克斯洛伐克的银幕上，今年将要有二十部新的国产影片同观众见面，其中包括根据闻名世界的捷克斯洛伐克小说“好兵帅克”改编的彩色片。新摄影片中有几部是同外国电影工作者合作的，如同保加利亚合摄的根据土耳其作家希克梅特同名的话剧改编的“爱情的故事”。同德意志民主共和国合摄的影片“第一九二一班”描写一个年青的捷克人在战时被劫到德国去从事强迫劳动的故事。同法国影剧作家雅·雷米合作的一部影片将描写法国士兵参加1944年斯洛伐克民族起义的故事。　（陈）
