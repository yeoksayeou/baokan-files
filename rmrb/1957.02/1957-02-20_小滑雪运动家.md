Little Ski Athletes
　　Lǐ Détiān, Hé Zhìchāo

At the 1957 National Skiing Competition, a group of young skiers attracted much attention from the audience.

These young skiers came from Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other places. They are physically strong and also do well in their studies. Although the oldest of them are only sixteen years old and the youngest are only nine years old, many of them have two or three years of skiing experience and have participated in two or three skiing competitions.

When the young athletes started learning to ski, they all liked to sit on small sleds and slide down the mountains. Then, they used bamboo strips or small wooden boards to make their own simple skis, and used two short sticks as ski poles to practice skiing. At this competition, the young skiers showed good skiing skills in their performances. In the slalom obstacle course performance, they were all quick-witted and calm, and rarely fell down while flying quickly through the flag gates from the hillside. Agile young athletes tucked their arms and ski poles while skiing down quickly, their bodies hunched over, like little swallows, flying down the snow-covered mountains. Many of these young athletes have also mastered the technique of ski jumping. In this competition, the young athletes from Jilin City also performed their own invented "pancake" style skiing. One after another, they spun around and slid down the mountain, winning cheers from the audience.

The young athletes share the common characteristics of being brave and tenacious. During skiing, some of them accidentally fell in the middle of the mountain, tumbling several times, but they immediately stood up and skied down again with a smile. Tong Zhenghui, a thirteen-year-old female athlete from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, fell as soon as she went downhill when she first arrived, but now she can ski freely.

In recent years, the state has been paying attention to cultivating this new force in skiing. Jilin City has an amateur ski school, which uses spare time to hire specialized instructors to teach skiing techniques to outstanding young skiers. The sports department also provides young athletes with skis, ski poles, etc. Tonghua City also regularly trains young skiers. Under the influence of these young athletes, more and more young skiing enthusiasts can now be seen on the ski slopes of the Hunjiang River in Tonghua and the Beishan ski slopes in Jilin. A future force for skiing will soon emerge.

    小滑雪运动家
    李德天　何志超
    在1957年全国滑雪运动会上，一群少年、儿童滑雪运动员使观众很感兴趣。
    这些小滑雪运动员来自吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古自治区等地。他们身体强壮，学习成绩也好。虽然他们年龄最大的只有十六岁，小的才九岁，但他们当中的许多人已经具有二、三年以上的滑雪经历，并且参加过二、三次滑雪比赛了。
    小运动员们在开始学滑雪时，都喜欢坐小雪撬从山上滑下来。接着，他们就用竹条或小木板自己制造最简单的小滑雪板，拿两根短棍当滑雪杖，练习滑雪。这次运动会上，小滑雪运动员在表演中显示了很好的滑雪技巧。在回旋障碍滑行表演时，他们都很机敏、沉着，从山坡上飞快地穿过各道旗门很少摔倒的。矫捷的小运动员在快速降下滑行时，双臂把滑雪杖一挟，身体俯缩，像一只小燕，飞一般地从雪山上滑下来。这些小运动员中有很多人还掌握了飞跃滑行技术。在这次运动会中，吉林市的小运动员们还表演了自己发明的“摊煎饼”式滑雪。他们一个接一个，一面打转、一面从山上滑下来，博得观众的喝彩。
    小运动员们共同具有的特点是勇敢、顽强。在滑行中他们有的不慎在半山腰摔倒，翻了几个跟斗，但是马上站起来，又笑嘻嘻地滑下去。内蒙古自治区十三岁的女运动员童蒸慧初来时，一下坡就滑倒，但现在她已滑行自如了。
    近年来，国家已在注意培养这一批滑雪运动的新生力量。吉林市设有业余滑雪学校，利用业余时间，聘请专门指导人员为优秀的小滑雪运动员讲授滑雪技术。体育部门还供应给小运动员们滑雪板、雪杖等。通化市也定期训练小滑雪运动员。在这些小运动员影响下，现在通化浑江畔的滑雪场和吉林北山滑雪场上，已经可以看到越来越多的少年儿童滑雪爱好者。一支未来的滑雪运动生力军不久就要出现。
