    With the development of the publishing industry, the influence of book design and illustration art in people's lives has also expanded. In Beijing alone, there are about fifty publishing institutions, publishing more than ten thousand kinds of books every year, with print runs ranging from several thousand to hundreds of thousands of copies. What a huge number this is! From this, one can imagine why publishing institutions often receive a large number of letters from readers—they are praising the achievements of publishing work, but at the same time, they are more urgently demanding to improve the quality of book design and illustration.
    To study and improve the work of book design and illustration, two aspects cannot be ignored: First is the technical aspect, including printing technology and the quality of book materials. The Publishing Administration has already begun to pay attention to this issue. For example, in recent years, many new printing and phototypesetting equipment have been added, and the Printing Research Institute has also been established recently. The second is to improve the artistic level of publication design and illustration. This issue does not seem to have been valued by the relevant departments so far.
    The issue of improving the artistic level of publication design and illustration is essentially the issue of improving the artistic cultivation and professional skills of design and illustration workers. Therefore, it is necessary for us to first discuss the working conditions of design and illustration personnel.
    Taking Beijing as an example, there are more than a hundred design and illustration workers in various publishing institutions, scattered in various publishing houses to work. As the division of labor in publishing institutions becomes increasingly detailed, and dozens of established publishing houses are followed by the continuous emergence of new specialized publishing houses, book design and illustration workers are also increasingly divided into finer categories. This kind of professional division of labor may be "scientific" for publishing institutions (but there is also a great need for research), but for book design and illustration art, it is clearly unscientific. Under this meticulous division of labor, the art workers of publishing houses are gradually separated from broad life practice and confined to a corner, resulting in increasingly one-sided and impoverished artistic cultivation and life knowledge.
    At the same time, the leaders of specialized publishing institutions are, of course, experts in various fields, but they may not all understand the characteristics of art work, and some may even have little interest in art. Even if they want to do this work well, they often interfere without principle because they do not understand the nature of artistic creation. Please see some examples below: A leader of a publishing house likes red, so the books published by this publishing house are primarily red. The art workers disagree, believing that colors should be diverse, otherwise it will cause reader fatigue. The leader disagreed, saying: "Red is a symbol of revolution, and our revolutionary publishing house should use red," and also said: "How can red be annoying? The five-star red flag is flying everywhere, who is annoyed?" Some publishing houses, because the leaders like simplified so-called "serious and generous" designs, decorative patterns, multi-color printing, etc., are mostly rejected across the board, resulting in a large number of so-called "white papers" ridiculed by readers. Someone designed the book "The Great Soviet Union" to be magnificent, and it was criticized as having "imperial color flavor" and rejected. An art worker of a magazine aimed at women invited the old traditional Chinese painter Yu Fei'an to paint a "Peony" and wanted to publish it on the cover. Their leader disagreed: "Why publish this painting? What is the relationship between peony and women, and what is the role of encouragement for production?" Some leaders of publishing houses like large fonts, so "No. 1 Old Song" often appears on some book covers. Some leaders insisted that the designers "combine with the content." For example, a book whose content is roughly about the shadow of the United States shrouding a certain region of the world, so the designer was required to draw both an American and the shadow of this American falling on a certain region on the cover. May I ask, doesn't such a cover design become a simple illustration or "picture reading"?
    The above are just a small part of similar examples. Because the publishing house has layers of leaders doing "instructions" and "approval" work, art works often become unrecognizable after passing through these many levels.
    Some of the leaders mentioned above are still relatively concerned about design art. In addition, there are some leaders of publishing houses who only know how to simply require art workers to "complete and overfulfill the production plan every month," stipulate a series of indicators and quotas, and also have a "super-achievement bonus system," etc., and lead in the same way as industrial production. They only know to be "fast" and "saving," as for whether it is good or not, they often do not care.
    Design and illustration workers also face many difficulties in artistic improvement. Except for a very small number of publishing houses where art personnel are slightly more and can adjust their time to conduct some study, the art workers of most publishing houses do not have the possibility of further study and contact with life. They have been like this for many years, so their works often become similar, monotonous and boring formats. For example, using ancient cloud patterns to symbolize the smoke of factories, using vertical and horizontal line patterns to symbolize the transportation network, many book covers have appeared with bronze patterns…. They often design books reflecting our country's socialist construction, but they have not left the office for a long time. Some people often design books about rural areas, but even now they cannot distinguish the five grains clearly, or paint the livestock shed of the agricultural production cooperative as the donkey pen of the former individual farmers. Some, when designing books on industrial production, often obviously draw the posture of machines or workers incorrectly, or it is not even the case at all. There are many similar examples. In addition, many design designers often use dim colors, because they sit in the office all day long "working," and rarely come into contact with the rich and colorful real life, it is difficult for them to tune out brilliant colors in their brushes.
    The long-term depression of design and illustration workers who cannot get further study is a common problem. Some of them have requested to be given fixed time for study every week, and the leaders' reply is: "The organ study is unified, no special arrangements are allowed," or "this cannot hinder the production plan" and "this is an enterprise unit and no time can be given for further study!" Therefore, everyone can only study secretly in their spare time, and some can only run out of the city during annual holidays to do some sketching. And even so, sometimes they cannot avoid being criticized by the leaders for "being detached from politics" and "individual development."
    In addition, the waste of human resources of book design and illustration workers is also a problem. Some of them have served as section chiefs or group leaders in publishing houses, some have been assigned to do management work for "art design plans," or serve as "business secretaries." With the development of the publishing industry, more and more art workers are constantly becoming "promotion targets" for administrative leading cadres. In fact, they have all changed careers or are about to change careers. Coupled with the inappropriate distribution of work, for example, someone is good at drawing illustrations of rural life, but is assigned to a publishing house that publishes science or theoretical books, someone has more research on the design of historical books, but is assigned to do current affairs reading materials, etc. Therefore, even the publishing houses that currently have more art personnel still feel "insufficient manpower" in design and illustration work.
    The four of us are all book design and illustration workers. In many years of practical work, we have deeply felt that the above-mentioned situations should be improved, otherwise, it will be difficult to talk about the improvement of design and illustration art. We hope that the leaders of the publishing administration departments and various publishing units attach importance to these issues, recognize that design and illustration work is a kind of artistic creation; do not interfere with simple administrative orders; give design and illustration workers the conditions that may facilitate creation, and help them carry out business study; respect the characteristics and creative styles of art workers; various publishing houses should exchange experiences with each other, jointly organize further study, research, exhibitions, observation and evaluation; reasonably use art cadres, and also cultivate them regularly; and also encourage the absorption and reference of advanced foreign experiences. The People's Daily editorial "To Cultural Workers" on December 28 last year said it very well, flourishing culture and art "if we do not resolutely take specific administrative measures and change certain management systems, improving quality will always be empty talk." Only in this way, the statement "China's publications should catch up with the world's advanced level in twelve years" may not be in vain!

    书籍装帧插图工作者的希望
    张慈中　魏水山　袁运甫　孙正
    随着出版事业的发展，书籍装帧插图艺术在人们生活中的影响也扩大了。仅北京一地的出版机构就有五十家左右，每年出书在万种以上，每种印数自几千册至几十万册不等，这是一个多么巨大的数字！由此可以想像到，为什么出版机构常常收到大批读者来信——他们在称赞出版工作成绩的同时，更迫切地要求提高书籍装帧插图的质量。
    研究改进书籍装帧插图工作，不能忽略两个方面：第一是技术方面，包括印刷技术与书籍用料的质量。这一问题出版事业管理局已经开始注意到了，例如近年增添了不少新式印刷、照像制版设备，印刷研究所最近也成立起来了。第二是提高出版物的装帧插图艺术水平，这一问题至今似乎还未被有关部门所重视。
    提高出版物的装帧插图艺术水平问题，实质上就是提高装帧插图工作者艺术修养和专业技术的问题。因此我们首先来谈谈装帧插图人员的工作状况，是必要的。
    以北京一地为例，各个出版机构的装帧插图工作者，约共有百人以上，他们三三两两地分散在各出版社进行工作。由于出版机构的分工日趋细密，随着早已成立的数十家之后，还不断有新的专业出版社产生，书籍装帧插图工作者因此也跟随着愈益细密地分起工来了。这种专业分工，对出版机构来说或许是“科学”的（不过也大有研究的必要），但对书籍装帧插图艺术来说，则是十分明显地并不科学。在这种细密分工之下，出版社的美术工作者因此逐渐脱离了宽广的生活实践而被局限于一隅，造成了艺术修养和生活知识的日益片面和贫乏。
    同时，专业出版机构的领导者，固然都是各个方面的专家，但他们对美术工作的特点，并不一定都能理解，有的甚至干脆对美术兴趣不大。即使他们想把这一工作搞好，但往往由于不理解艺术创作工作的性质，实际上反而形成无原则的干预了。请看下面的一些例子：有个出版社的领导者，因为他喜爱红色，这个出版社出的书就以红为尚。美术工作同志们不同意，认为颜色应该多彩多样，否则将会引起读者厌烦，领导者大不以为然，他说：“红色是革命的象征，我们革命的出版社就要用红色”，又说：“红色怎会叫人厌烦呢？五星红旗到处飘扬，有谁厌烦？”有的出版社因领导者喜爱简单化的所谓“严肃大方”，于是装饰纹样、多彩套印，等等，多被一概否定了，这样就出现了大量被读者讥讽的所谓“白皮书”来。有人把“伟大的苏联”一书设计得富丽堂皇，就被指为有“帝国色彩风味”而否定了。一个以妇女为对象的杂志的美术工作者，约请老国画家于非暗先生画了一幅“牡丹”，想刊登在封面上。她们的领导者却不同意：“为什么要刊登这幅画呢？牡丹与妇女有什么关系，对生产又有什么鼓舞作用呢？”有的出版社的领导者喜爱大的字体，因此有些书面上就经常出现“头号老宋”。有的领导者则硬要设计者“结合内容”，例如有一本书，内容大意是说美国的阴影笼罩着世界的某一地区，于是就要设计者在封面上既要画出一个美国佬，又要画出这个美国佬的影子倒在某一地区。试问，这样的封面装帧不是成了简单的图解或“看图识字”了吗？
    以上所举，仅是类似事例的一小部分。由于出版社有层层领导在做“指示”和“批审”工作，美术作品通过这许多关口，往往面目全非。
    上面所说的一些领导者，究竟对装帧艺术还是比较关心的。而此外，还有这样一些出版社的领导者，他们只知单纯地要求美术工作者“按月完成并超额完成生产计划”，规定了一系列的指标和定额，还有什么“超额奖励制度”，等等，采取对工业生产一样的方式进行领导。他们只知道要“快”和“省”，至于好不好，就往往不过问了。
    装帧插图工作者在艺术进修方面也困难重重，除了极少数的出版社因美术人员稍多略能调剂时间进行一点学习外，绝大多数出版社的美术工作者得不到进修和接触生活的可能，多年来始终如此，于是作品往往都变成大同小异、枯燥乏味的格式了。例如以古代云纹图案来象征工厂的烟雾，以纵横线图案象征交通网，很多书籍封面都出现了古铜器图案……。他们经常设计反映我国社会主义建设的书籍，但自己却长久没有离开过办公室。有人经常设计关于农村方面的书籍，但至今连五谷也识别不清，或把农业生产合作社的牲口棚画成以前个体农户的驴圈。有的在设计关于工业生产方面的书籍时，往往把机器或工人操作的姿态明显地画错，甚至根本不是那回事了。类似的例子是很多的。另外，很多装帧设计工作者经常在使用着灰暗的颜色，因为他们整日坐在办公室里“办公”，很少接触到丰富多采的现实生活，他们的笔下就很难调得出灿烂夺目的色彩。
    装帧插图工作者长期得不到进修的苦闷是个普遍的问题。他们有的曾要求每周予以固定时间进行学习，领导者的答复是：“机关学习统一布置，不得特殊”，或“不能因此妨碍了生产计划”和“这里是企业单位不能给进修时间”！因此，大家只能在业余时间自己偷偷学习，有的只能借年节假期出城跑跑，作些写生画。而这样，有时还不免受到领导者的指责，说是“脱离政治”、“个人发展”。
    此外，书籍装帧插图工作者人力上的浪费，也是一个问题。他们有的在出版社中担任了科长或组长，有的被分配做“美术设计计划”的管理工作，或担任什么“业务秘书”，随着出版事业的发展，有更多美术工作者不断成为行政领导干部的“提拔对象”，事实上他们都已改行或者行将改行。加以工作分配的不尽恰当，例如有人长于画农村生活方面的插图，却被分配在出版科学或理论书籍的出版社，有人对历史书籍的装帧较有研究，却被分配搞时事读物等等，因此，即如目前美术人员较多的出版社，在装帧插图工作上也还是感到“人力不足”。
    我们四人都是书籍装帧插图工作者，在多年来的实际工作中深深感到上述这些情况应该加以改善，不然，要谈装帧插图艺术的提高，是比较困难的。我们希望：出版事业管理部门和各出版单位的领导者，重视这些问题，承认装帧插图工作是一种艺术创作；不要以简单的行政命令去加以干涉；要给予装帧插图工作者以创作上可能便利的条件，帮助他们进行业务学习；要尊重艺术工作者的特点和创造风格；各出版社应互相交流经验，共同组织进修、研究、展览、观摩和评奖；对美术干部要合理地使用，也要经常地培养；对于外国的先进经验，也要鼓励吸收和参考。去年12月28日人民日报“致文化工作者”这篇社论说得很对，繁荣文化艺术“如果不坚决采取具体的行政措施和改变某些管理制度，提高质量永远是一句空话” 。只有这样，“我国出版物要在十二年内赶上世界先进水平”这句话，才可能不致落空！
