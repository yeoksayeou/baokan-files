	Workers' Council Congress to be Held in June
	The first congress of Yugoslavia's Workers' Councils is scheduled to be held in June this year. According to the "Yugoslav News Bulletin" published in Belgrade, the congress will discuss the position and role of workers' self-management as the basic form of socialist democracy in Yugoslavia, and will summarize the experience of workers' councils and workers' management. In addition to hearing a main report analyzing the theory and practice of workers' management, the congress is expected to hear reports on the material basis of workers' self-management, the working methods of workers' councils, and the new social and labor relations arising from workers' self-management, etc.
	Seventeen hundred representatives from various workers' councils will participate in the congress. In addition, representatives from trade union organizations, economic institutions, the Producers' Chamber of the Federal and Republic National Assemblies, factory directors, and political and cultural workers will also attend the congress, totaling approximately two hundred and fifty people.
	Developing Backward Areas
	The National Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina recently approved the Republic's development plan for 1957. Industrial production is expected to increase by 15% this year.
	This republic possesses abundant resources of timber, coal, oil, and minerals, but it was one of the most backward areas in Yugoslavia in the past. Since the war, many new factories and hydroelectric power stations have been built here. In addition to the large steel plant built in Zenica and a modern iron smelting plant built in Ilijaš, several chemical plants and timber processing factories, two textile factories, and several power stations have been built, including the "Jablanica" hydroelectric power station with an annual power generation of 700 million kilowatt-hours. New coal mines have also been established, and old mines have been expanded and renovated. Due to this rapid development, Bosnia and Herzegovina's industrial output today has increased threefold compared to pre-war 1939 and is higher than the national output of Yugoslavia before the war.
	Designing and Building Projects for Foreign Countries
	The port construction enterprise in Split (one of Yugoslavia's largest seaports) is building the port of Latakia on the Mediterranean coast for Syria. This is the largest project undertaken by Yugoslav enterprises for foreign countries, with a total value of 2.3 billion dinars (300 dinars equals one US dollar). In Syria, Yugoslavia has also completed the construction of a dam for the country.
	Last year, Yugoslavia signed new contracts with foreign countries for assistance in construction projects or enterprises, with a total value of 1 billion dinars. According to the contracts, Yugoslavia will build four thermal power stations for India and several hydroelectric power stations and pumping stations for Syria. In addition, Yugoslavia plans to build the port of Tripoli for Lebanon and a hydroelectric power station for Burma.
	The Tourist Season is Approaching
	With the passing of the harsh winter and the return of spring, the travel and tourism season is about to begin in Yugoslavia. In the Dalmatian region, the first group of foreign tourists will be welcomed in March. After that, another 250 groups totaling 6,500 foreign tourists will come for sightseeing. 60% of the rooms in various hotels have already been booked. In addition, approximately 15,000 foreign tourists will visit Split, Makarska, and Dubrovnik. Travelers from West Germany, Britain, France, Switzerland, Austria, and the Nordic countries are particularly interested in the scenery along the Adriatic coast. In addition, some travelers from Eastern countries will also travel to Yugoslavia for sightseeing in a few months.

    在南斯拉夫
    工人委员会代表大会六月举行
    南斯拉夫工人委员会的第一届代表大会预定将在今年6月间举行。据贝尔格莱德出版的“南斯拉夫新闻公报”载称，这次代表大会将研讨作为南斯拉夫社会主义民主基本形式的工人自治的地位和作用，并将总结工人委员会和工人管理的经验。大会预定除了听取有关工人管理的理论和实践的分析的主要报告外，还将听取这样一些报告：工人自治的物质基础，工人委员会的工作方法，在工人自治的基础上所产生的新的社会和劳动关系，等等。
    参加这次代表大会的将有各工人委员会的代表一千七百人。另外，各工会组织，经济机构，联邦和各共和国国民议会的生产者院的代表，工厂厂长，政治和文化工作者也将出席这次大会，这部分人总共将有二百五十名左右。
    开发落后地区
    波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那共和国国民议会最近通过了1957年的共和国发展计划。预定今年的工业生产要增加15％。
    这个共和国拥有十分丰富的木材、煤炭、石油和矿藏，但它在过去却是南斯拉夫最落后的地区之一。战后，这里已经建立了许多新的工厂和水电站。除了在泽尼查建立的大钢铁厂和在伊里亚斯建立的一个现代化的冶铁厂外，还建立了几个化学厂和木材加工工厂，两座纤维工厂和几个发电站，其中包括每年发电量达七亿瓩时的“雅布兰尼查”水电站。新的煤井也已建立，而旧有的矿坑亦进行了扩大和改建。由于这种迅速的发展，波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那今天的工业生产量已比战前1939年增加了两倍而高于战前南斯拉夫全国的产量。
    为外国设计和建造工程
    斯普里特（南斯拉夫最大的海港之一）的港口建筑企业，正在为叙利亚建设濒临地中海的拉塔基亚港。这是南斯拉夫企业为外国建造的最大的工程，其价值共为二十三亿第纳尔（三百第纳尔合一美元）。在叙利亚，南斯拉夫还为这个国家完成了一个水坝的建设。
    南斯拉夫去年又和外国签订了一些帮助建设工程或企业的新的合同，总值一十亿第纳尔。根据合同，南斯拉夫将为印度建造四个热电站，为叙利亚建造几个水电站和抽水站。此外，在计划中，南斯拉夫还将为黎巴嫩建造的黎波里港，为缅甸建造一个水电站。
    游览季节即将到来
    随着严冬的逝去和大地的回春，旅行和游览的季节即将在南斯拉夫开始。在达尔马西亚地区，3月间就要迎接第一批外国旅行者到来。此后还将有二百五十批共六千五百名外国旅行者前来观光游览。现在各个旅馆的60％的房间已被预订一空。另外，大约有一万五千名外国旅行者将到斯普里特，马卡尔斯加和杜布罗夫尼克去游览。西德、英国、法国、瑞士、奥地利和北欧各国的旅行家们对于亚得里亚海沿岸的风光特别感到兴趣。另外，东方国家的一些旅行者也将在几个月以后到南斯拉夫去旅行观光。
