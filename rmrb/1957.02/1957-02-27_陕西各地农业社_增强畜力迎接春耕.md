Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch: Currently, over 30,000 agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi Province are adopting the method of "less use, increased feed" to restore and enhance livestock power in preparation for the upcoming spring plowing.

Many agricultural cooperatives, in order to give draught animals more rest time before the spring plowing, are now taking various measures to reduce their labor. In counties such as Pucheng, Dali, and Chang'an, since the beginning of spring, the work of delivering manure nearby has been done with handcarts and human carrying, with animals only used for longer distances. On the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi, many villages have newly built water cellars to solve the problem of water for people and livestock, reducing the need for animals to haul water from distant mountain gullies. Many agricultural cooperatives in the Qinling Mountains are installing water mills. It is estimated that a water mill with the capacity to grind 600 jin of flour per day can save the labor of ten livestock workers.

Shaanxi Province had a bumper harvest last year, and the spring fodder for draught animals is generally well stocked. Most agricultural cooperatives have further promoted the method of "separate feeding" for old, young, and weak animals. In addition to adding half a jin to one jin of feed per day for general livestock, special care is also given to young and weak animals.

### 陕西各地农业社  增强畜力迎接春耕

    陕西各地农业社
    增强畜力迎接春耕
    据新华社西安电　陕西全省三万多个农业社目前正在采取“少使、加料”的办法，来恢复和增强畜力，迎接即将到来的春耕。
    许多农业社为了使耕畜在春耕前能得到较多的休息时间，现在正采取各种办法减少耕畜的劳役。蒲城、大荔、长安等县，开春以来近处的送粪工作都用手车推和人担，远处才使牲口。渭北高原上已有不少村庄新打了许多水窖，解决人畜的用水问题，减少了牲畜到远处山沟驮水的劳役。秦岭山区许多农业社正在安装水磨，据估计，设备一个每天磨面六百斤的水磨就可以节省下十个畜工。
    陕西省去年丰收，耕畜的春季饲料一般都贮备充足。大多数农业社进一步推行了老、幼、弱畜“分槽喂养”的办法，除了给一般牲口每天加料半斤到一斤外，还对幼畜和弱畜加以特殊照顾。
