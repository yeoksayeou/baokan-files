Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 26th: The summit conference of the four Arab nations—Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan—opened on the morning of February 25th at the Kubba Palace in Cairo.

Attending the conference were the presidents of Egypt and Syria, the kings of Saudi Arabia and Jordan, and the government heads of these countries.

According to an official press release after the meeting, the four heads of state studied the general international situation at their first meeting, with a particular focus on Arab issues. The second meeting was scheduled for the morning of February 26th.

The official agenda for the conference was not announced. However, Cairo observers point out that the primary issue for discussion will be Israel's refusal to withdraw its troops and the common policy Arab nations will adopt towards Israel. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" will also occupy an important position on the conference agenda, as the King of Saudi Arabia recently visited the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 26th: According to the Middle East News Agency, Jordanian Prime Minister Suleiman Nabulsi said on February 25th: "We reject any interference from any country that attempts to impose its own will on us under the pretext of protecting us, because this is incompatible with our sovereignty."

Nabulsi also stated that any claims about "Communist infiltration" into Jordan are imperialist propaganda.

Nabulsi said: "We do not believe the claims of some Western countries about the existence of a vacuum. We believe that the defense of the Arab world should be the responsibility of the Arab nations themselves."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 26th: Egyptian newspapers published editorials on February 25th welcoming the opening of the Arab four-nation summit and emphasized the hope that Arab countries would unite and cooperate to counter the various conspiracies of Western countries.

"Al-Gomhouria" stated that the conference is significant because of the situation surrounding Arab nations, the various conspiracies brewing against Arab nationalism, the political and economic pressures being exerted on Arab nations that have already gained freedom, and the interference in their national affairs.

The newspaper pointed out that, in essence, this conference is aimed at organizing the Arab countries' struggle against imperialism, using a strong Arab front, loyal to the Arab spirit and full of victorious confidence, to defeat all imperialist conspiracies and tricks. Western politicians will see that, despite their attempts to undermine Arab unity, the Arab front is stronger today than ever before.

"Al-Ahram" pointed out that the Arab world is currently facing four major problems: the issue of wanting Israeli ships to enjoy freedom of navigation in the Arab territorial waters around the Gulf of Aqaba; the Gaza issue; attempts to organize alliances to bind North African Arab countries with treaties, isolating them from the rest of the Arab world and tightly binding them to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and the Eisenhower's Middle East Plan. "Al-Ahram" stated that all these problems are intertwined and therefore constitute the reason for the current clear trend of Arab countries strengthening internal unity.

"Al-Akhbar," in discussing this issue, emphasized that the problems faced by the liberated Arab nations are so closely related to each other that a common decision should be made on all problems as a whole.

    阿拉伯四国首脑会议在开罗开幕
    约旦首相反对外国借口“保护”进行干涉
    埃报希望加强团结对付西方国家的阴谋
    据新华社开罗26日电　埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和约旦四个阿拉伯国家的首脑会议25日上午在开罗库巴宫开幕。
    参加会议的有埃及和叙利亚的总统，沙特阿拉伯和约旦的国王，以及这些国家的政府负责人。
    据会后官方发表的新闻公报说，四国首脑在他们的第一次会议上研究了一般的国际局势，特别讨论到阿拉伯问题。第二次会议预定在26日上午举行。
    这次会议的正式议程没有宣布。但是据开罗的观察家们指出，首先讨论的问题将会是以色列拒绝撤军的问题和阿拉伯国家将对以色列的态度采取的共同政策。“艾森豪威尔主义”也将在会议议程上占重要地位，因为沙特阿拉伯国王最近刚访问了美国。
    新华社开罗26日电　据中东通讯社报道，约旦首相苏莱曼·纳布西25日说：“我们拒绝企图以保护我们为借口而把它自己的意志强加在我们身上的任何国家的任何干涉，因为这是同我们的主权不相容的。”
    纳布西还说，任何关于“共产党渗入”约旦的说法都是帝国主义的宣传。
    纳布西说：“我们不相信某些西方国家关于存在一种真空的说法。我们认为阿拉伯世界的防御应该由阿拉伯国家本身来担当。”
    据新华社开罗26日电　埃及各报25日发表社论欢迎阿拉伯四国首脑会议开幕，并且都强调希望阿拉伯各国团结合作，以对付西方国家的各种阴谋。
    “共和国报”说，这次会议之所以具有重要意义是由于围绕着阿拉伯国家发生的事态，是由于酝酿中的对阿拉伯民族主义的各种阴谋，是由于对已经获得自由的阿拉伯国家施加政治压力、经济压力的活动，也是由于对它们各国事务的干涉。
    这家报纸指出，实质上，这次会议是要组织阿拉伯国家对帝国主义的斗争，以一个忠于阿拉伯精神并且充满胜利信心的强大的阿拉伯阵线去击败帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计。西方政界人士将会看到，尽管他们企图破坏阿拉伯的团结，阿拉伯阵线今天比以前任何时候都更加强大。
    “金字塔报”指出，现在阿拉伯世界面临着四个重大问题：想使以色列船只在亚喀巴湾这一带阿拉伯领海内享有航行自由的问题；加沙问题；有人企图组织联盟把北非阿拉伯国家用条约束缚起来，使它们同阿拉伯世界其他国家隔离开来，并且把它们同北大西洋公约组织紧紧缚在一起；以及艾森豪威尔的中东计划问题。“金字塔报”说，所有这些问题都互相交织在一起，并且因而构成了阿拉伯国家当前加强内部团结这种明白趋势的理由。
    “消息报”在谈到这个问题的时候强调指出，已经获得解放的阿拉伯国家所面临的问题互相之间具有这样密切的关系，因此应该对所有问题作为一个整体做出共同的决定来。
