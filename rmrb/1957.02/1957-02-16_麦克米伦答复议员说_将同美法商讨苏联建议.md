Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th dispatch: British Prime Minister Macmillan said in the House of Commons on the 14th, in response to questions from members of parliament, that Britain would carefully study the recent Soviet proposals on the Middle East issue and would discuss these proposals with the United States and France. He said he would not express his attitude toward these proposals until after consulting with the United States and France.

Labor MP Younger suggested that the British Prime Minister should explain to the US government that "the (US) State Department's very discouraging statement on the Soviet proposals without prior consultation is not a good approach, and this practice will create a bad impression on America's allies."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Washington "Star" published an article commenting on Shepilov's report and the Soviet government's note to the three Western powers, calling on the US government not to underestimate the Soviet proposals.

The newspaper said: It is best to "look to the future. There are two problems in this regard. First, Moscow's proposals may arouse widespread sympathy in Arab countries. Second, the Eisenhower Plan, which Moscow is targeting, does not guarantee a solution to the fundamental problems of the Middle East." "We believe that the Russian proposals should not be rejected outright."

The "Star" suggested "seeking some common ground for negotiation."

    麦克米伦答复议员说
    将同美法商讨苏联建议
    新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦14日在下院回答议员的质问时说，英国将仔细研究最近苏联关于中东问题的建议，并且同美国和法国商讨这些建议。他说，在同美、法商讨以前，他将不对这些建议表示态度。
    工党议员杨格建议英国首相向美国政府说明，“（美国）国务院不经事先磋商就对苏联的建议发表了十分令人沮丧的声明，这不是一个好方法，这种做法会使美国的盟国产生不好的印象”。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿“明星报”发表文章评论谢皮洛夫的报告和苏联政府给西方三国的照会，它呼吁美国政府不要轻视苏联的建议。
    报纸说：最好是“看一看未来。在这方面存在着两个问题。第一，莫斯科的建议在阿拉伯各国可能引起广泛的同情。第二，莫斯科所针对的艾森豪威尔计划一点也不能保证解决中东的基本问题。”“我们认为，不应该断然拒绝俄国人的建议”。
    “明星报”建议“寻求进行谈判的某种共同基础”。
