Xinhua News Agency, London, 14th (TASS dispatch): The Executive Committee of the Anglo-Soviet Friendship Association has passed a resolution requesting that Macmillan accept Bulganin's invitation and, after returning from his visit to the United States, hold talks with Bulganin "as soon as possible on issues such as the development of trade, disarmament, European security, and the Middle East, as well as further development of cultural exchange."

The resolution points out the increase in unemployment in Britain and the current shortage of oil, and mentions the mutually beneficial long-term trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and France a few days ago, requesting the British government to take measures to expand trade with the Soviet Union.
