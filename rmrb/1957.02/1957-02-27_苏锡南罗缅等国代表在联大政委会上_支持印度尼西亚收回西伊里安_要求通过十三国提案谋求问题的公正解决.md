Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee continued its discussion of the West Irian issue on February 25th. Many representatives spoke in support of the proposal put forward by representatives of India, Burma, and thirteen other countries at the meeting on the 23rd. This proposal suggests that the President of the United Nations General Assembly appoint a conciliation committee to assist the governments of Indonesia and the Netherlands in negotiations to seek a just and peaceful resolution of this issue.

    Sri Lankan representative Gunawardene said that the Bandung Conference had discussed the West Irian issue and unanimously decided to support Indonesia's claim to West Irian, considering it legitimate and well-founded. He advocated resolving the issue through the thirteen-nation proposal.

    Soviet representative Zharubin emphasized the importance of discussing the West Irian issue, saying that the unresolved West Irian dispute was adversely affecting relations in an important region of the world. The Soviet Union believes that Indonesia's demands are well-founded, both from the perspective of justice and international law. Sovereignty over the Dutch East Indies has been unconditionally transferred to Indonesia. Therefore, Indonesia's sovereignty must also extend to West Irian, which is an inseparable part of Indonesia.

    Zharubin pointed out that the Netherlands' attitude on this issue seriously threatens peace. He said that resolving the West Irian dispute would have great political significance not only for Indonesia but for the entire Asia.

    Zharubin concluded that the struggle for the freedom of West Irian is part of the overall struggle of Asian countries to strengthen their independence and national sovereignty. He supported the thirteen-nation proposal.

    Yugoslav representative Belovski, Romanian representative Micescu, and Burmese representative U Pe Khin all supported the thirteen-nation proposal in their speeches and requested its adoption.

    Bolivian representative Ortiz, another initiator of the thirteen-nation proposal, demanded that the Netherlands should recognize Indonesia's sovereignty over West Irian.

    Australian representative Spender and Belgian representative Van Langenhove spoke from the standpoint of colonial countries. They opposed the thirteen-nation proposal and argued that the United Nations should not discuss Indonesia's claim to the island.

    Also speaking at yesterday's meeting were representatives from Chile and Japan. The Chilean representative hoped to adopt a spirit of "reconciliation" on this issue. Japanese representative Renzo Sawada requested that the United Nations could take a "constructive" step to mediate.

    The meeting concluded at this point, and the date of the next meeting was not set.

    苏锡南罗缅等国代表在联大政委会上
    支持印度尼西亚收回西伊里安
    要求通过十三国提案谋求问题的公正解决
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会25日继续讨论西伊里安问题，许多代表发言支持印度、缅甸等十三国代表在23日会议上提出的提案，这个提案建议联合国大会主席任命一个斡旋委员会，协助印度尼西亚和荷兰两国政府进行谈判，以求得这个问题的公正而和平的解决。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼说，万隆会议曾经讨论过西伊里安问题，并且一致作出决定，支持印度尼西亚对西伊里安的要求，认为这是正当的，而且是有充分根据的。他主张通过十三国提案使这个问题获得解决。
    苏联代表查鲁宾强调指出讨论西伊里安问题的重要性，他说，由于西伊里安争端仍然没有解决，因而使世界一个重要地区的关系受到不良影响。苏联认为，不论从正义角度和国际法角度来看，印度尼西亚的要求都是很有根据的。荷属东印度群岛的主权已经无条件地移交给印度尼西亚。因此，印度尼西亚的主权也必然伸展到西伊里安，这是印度尼西亚的不可分割的一部分。
    查鲁宾指出，荷兰在这个问题上的态度严重地威胁了和平。他说，西伊里安的争端如果获得解决，不仅对印度尼西亚而且对整个亚洲都有很大的政治意义。
    查鲁宾最后说，争取西伊里安自由的斗争是亚洲各国人民为加强自己的独立和国家主权而进行的总斗争的一部分。他支持十三国提案。
    南斯拉夫代表贝洛夫斯基、罗马尼亚代表米辛契斯库和缅甸代表吴佩庆在发言中都支持十三国提案，并且要求通过这个提案。
    十三国提案另一发起国玻利维亚的代表奥尔蒂斯要求荷兰应该承认印度尼西亚对西伊里安的主权。
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德和比利时代表范朗根霍维站在殖民国家的立场上说话，他们反对十三国提案，并且认为联合国不应该讨论印度尼西亚对这个岛屿的要求。
    在昨天会议上发言的还有智利代表和日本代表，智利代表希望对这个问题采取“和解”精神。日本代表泽田廉三要求联合国可以采取一种“建设性”的步骤来进行斡旋。
    会议至此结束，下次会议日期未定。
