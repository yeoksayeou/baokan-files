    No Additional Conditions Should Be Attached Beyond Voluntariness
    Yan Chuan, Bi Ye
    Recently, the large-scale employment of workers by handicraft production cooperatives in Changchun City has become very common. The number of employees in some handicraft cooperatives has exceeded the total number of members. The Changchun No. 16 Garment Cooperative, with only 187 members, employs 258 workers, almost one and a half workers per member. This situation is even more serious in Siping, Dalai, and other counties and cities.
    Why do handicraft production cooperatives have so many employees? Don't they want to join the cooperative? No. From the perspective of these employees, they all live by their labor. For many years, they have been unable to afford food and clothing. They yearn to take the path of cooperativization, but because the "door" of the handicraft cooperative is tightly closed, they cannot easily enter.
    Handicraft cooperatives are originally production organizations of handicraft laborers. The cooperative's charter stipulates that anyone who volunteers (except those without civil rights) and is approved by the members' congress can become a member. However, some handicraft departments act against the charter and fabricate many conditions. To join the cooperative, one must go through more than ten procedures, first a historical review, then submit a written application, fill out a membership application form, write an autobiography, then be introduced by the board of directors, discussed by the members' congress, and finally reviewed and approved by the superior cooperative. The Changchun No. 15 Sewing Cooperative also stipulated that seven conditions must be met for membership: 1. Concern for the cooperative; 2. Not picky about work; 3. Good labor viewpoint; 4. Have the viewpoint of the cooperative as home; 5. Actively willing to work; 6. Good character; 7. Abide by discipline. If one condition is not met, one must be "tested." For example, the employee Xiao Meiqing was not approved for membership after several applications because she did not sweep the floor when she was on duty and was picky about work a few times. More than 20 people like her have been "tested." The length of the "test" varies, the longest being more than a year. Under these conditions, many people are locked out of the cooperative's "door" and have to work as employees.
    In cooperatives with employed workers, there is a big difference between members and non-members: each member has the right to elect and be elected and the right to participate in the members' congress, while employed workers only have the right to work. This invisibly creates a divide between handicraft workers. Members believe that the cooperative is ours, and you (referring to the employees) are hired, so you should work honestly. The employed workers feel that they work the same as the members, cannot participate in cooperative management, and do not receive profit sharing based on labor, so they are not as enthusiastic about the cooperative as the members. Some employees regard the cooperative as their employer, and whether the cooperative is doing well or poorly has nothing to do with them. They only seek to pass the grade for the products they produce, not to make them better; they only pay attention to saving labor when working, not to saving materials. They say, "The materials belong to others, and the labor is my own."
    Now, the main production tools of many employees still belong to individuals. In addition, although some tools have implemented the method of "pricing, depositing in the cooperative, and paying interest," because they are not members of the cooperative, many difficulties arise when the cooperative handles internal matters.
    Handicraft production cooperatives have formulated many restrictive rules to restrict some handicraft laborers from joining the cooperative, but they hire them to participate in the cooperative's labor. This not only affects the production enthusiasm and the enthusiasm to take the path of cooperativization of some handicraft laborers, but it is also detrimental to the handicraft production cooperative itself. If it is required that handicraft workers have these conditions before joining the cooperative, then what is the meaning of transformation! Therefore, in addition to the membership conditions stipulated in the cooperative's charter, there should be no additional conditions.

    不该在自愿之外附加条件	言川　碧野
    最近，长春市手工业生产合作社大量雇用工人的情况很普遍，部分手工业合作社的雇用人数已经超过了社员的总数。仅长春市第十六被服社一百八十七名社员，雇用工人就有二百五十八人，几乎等于一个社员雇一个半工人。这种情况在四平、大赉等县市更为严重。
    为什么手工业生产合作社会有那么多雇工呢？难道他们都不愿意入社吗？不是。从这些雇工本身来看，都是靠劳动过日子的，多少年来他们吃不上、穿不上，他们向往着走合作化的道路，但是由于手工业合作社的“大门”关得紧紧的，他们轻易进不来。
    手工业社本来是手工业劳动者的生产组织。社章规定：凡本人自愿（没公民权者除外）、经社员大会讨论批准就可以成为社员。但是有些手工业部门硬是逆章行事，臆造了许多条件。一个人要想入社，得经过十多道手续，先是历史审查，然后提出书面申请，填写入社志愿书，写自传，再经理事会介绍，社员大会讨论，最后上级社审查批准。长春市第十五缝纫社还规定了必须具备七个入社条件：1、对社关心；2、不挑活；3、劳动观点好；4、有以社为家的观点；5、积极肯干；6、品德良好；7、守纪律。其中有一条不符，就得“考验考验”。例如雇工萧美庆几次申请入社都没有被批准。因为她值日的时候没扫地，挑了几次活。像她这样受“考验”的就有二十多人。“考验”的时间长短不等，最长的在一年以上。在这些条件限制下，很多人都被关到合作社的“门”外，只好当个雇工。
    在有雇用工人的合作社里，社员和非社员之间区别很大：每个社员都有选举权和被选举权，有参加社员大会的权利，而被雇工人只有劳动权。这样作无形中给手工业者之间划了一道鸿沟。社员认为合作社是我们的，你们（指雇工）是雇来的，应该老老实实干活。而雇用工人觉得和社员同样干活，不能参加合作管理，也得不到按劳分红，所以关心合作社远不如社员起劲。有的雇工把合作社看成是自己的雇主，合作社办好办坏与自己无关。他们对自己生产的产品只求及格，不求更好；做活只注意省工，不注意省料。他们说“料是人家的，工是自己的”。
    现在不少雇工的主要生产工具还归个人所有，另外还有一部分虽然工具实行了“作价、存社、付息”的办法，但因他本人不是社员，在合作社处理内部问题时，发生了很多困难。
    手工业生产合作社制定了许多清规戒律来限制一部分手工业劳动者入社，却又雇用他们参加社的劳动，这不仅影响了部分手工业劳动者的生产积极性和走合作化道路的积极性，而且对手工业生产合作社本身也是不利的。如果说要求手工业者在入社前就具备这些条件，那么改造还有什么意义呢！所以，除了社章规定的入社条件之外，是不该有什么附加条件的。
