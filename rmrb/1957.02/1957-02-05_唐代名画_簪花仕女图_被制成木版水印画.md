Tang Dynasty Famous Painting "Court Ladies Wearing Flowers" Reproduced as Woodblock Print

Using China's ancient woodblock printing method, Rongbaozhai completed the reproduction of the masterpiece "Court Ladies Wearing Flowers" by the great Tang Dynasty painter Zhou Fang on January 30th. This painting is more than 240 centimeters long and 57 centimeters wide, and it is the first time in more than 60 years that Rongbaozhai has reproduced such a large-scale famous painting.

More than 700 printing woodblocks were used to reproduce "Court Ladies Wearing Flowers." Each reproduction requires more than 1,000 impressions. The main colors used are mineral colors, which not only accurately reproduce the colors, but also naturally and vividly express the brushstrokes of the original painting.

"Court Ladies Wearing Flowers" is a famous painting from more than a thousand years ago. The woodblock print made this time is just like Zhou Fang's original. The picture shows the scene of noble women in the Tang Dynasty wearing flowers and enjoying themselves, with plump figures and brightly colored dresses. At the end of the painting, next to the stone, there is a purple-red magnolia flower, which makes people feel that the characters in the painting are slowly walking in a vast garden. The woodblock print still retains the original author's very skillful techniques: the combination of strength and softness and the well-proportioned lines are used exceptionally maturely, and the gestures and movements of the characters are painted in great detail.

Zhou Fang's original painting was treasured in the Forbidden City in Beijing in its early years, and later scattered in the Northeast. It is now preserved in the Shenyang Museum.

### 唐代名画“簪花仕女图”被制成木版水印画

    唐代名画“簪花仕女图”被制成木版水印画
    用我国古老的木板水印方法，荣宝斋1月30日完成唐代大画师周昉的杰作“簪花仕女图”的复制。这幅图长二百四十多公分，宽五十七公分，是荣宝斋六十多年来第一次复制的巨幅名画。
    复制“簪花仕女图”，有印刷木板七百多块，每复制一幅须套印一千多次，主要的是使用矿物颜色，不仅色彩印得准确，并且自然而生动地表达出原画的笔态。
    “簪花仕女图”是一千多年前的一幅名画，这次印制成的木板水印画，宛如周昉的原作。画面呈现了唐代贵族妇女簪花喜乐的情景，姿态丰盈，衣裙艳丽。画尾在石旁有一株紫红色的辛夷花，使人感到画中人物正缓步在广阔的花园里。木刻水印画依然保留原作者十分高明的表现手法：刚柔兼备和繁简适中的线条，运用得异常成熟，人物的举止动作画得细致入微。
    周昉的原画早年珍藏在北京的故宫，后来流散在东北，现在在沈阳博物馆保存。
