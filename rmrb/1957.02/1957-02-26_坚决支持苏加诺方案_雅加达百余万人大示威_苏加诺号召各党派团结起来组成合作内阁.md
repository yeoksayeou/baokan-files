Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 25th: Over one million people in Jakarta held a demonstration in front of the Independence Palace on the afternoon of the 24th, expressing their resolute support for President Sukarno's political reform plan announced three days prior. The demonstrating masses presented the President with a written statement supporting his proposal to establish a National Council and a cooperative cabinet composed of all national forces. The statement called on all patriotic people to work together to facilitate the implementation of this plan.

Sukarno expressed his gratitude for the people's enthusiastic support, saying that the matter would ultimately be decided by the nation's 82 million people, because they know what is right and what is wrong. He recalled that when the Republic of Indonesia declared independence in 1945, some people opposed the declaration of independence. However, facts later proved that it was not this small group of political leaders who were correct, but the overwhelming majority of people across the country who universally supported the declaration of independence, and now the Republic has stood firm for eleven years.

The President said that the ideals of the Declaration of Independence have not been fully realized and the revolution has not been completed, because the democratic system practiced in the past was Western democracy, which is obviously not in line with the spirit of the Indonesian people. What is suitable for Indonesia is Indonesian-style democracy, that is, merging all parties and groups into one big family to form a cooperative cabinet. Sukarno said, "I can't find any other way to overcome the current difficulties except to implement this plan."

The President reiterated that he has no prejudice against any group, but only hopes that all groups will sit down around a table. Sukarno said that revolutionary unity is a necessary condition for building a just and prosperous society.

At the same time, more public organizations issued statements supporting the President's plan. Among the groups that recently issued such statements is the largest plantation workers' organization - the Indonesian Republic Plantation Workers' Union.

Slogans demanding the implementation of the President's plan have appeared more frequently on the streets, especially on the buildings of Dutch companies. People in Jakarta say that the atmosphere prevailing in the Indonesian capital at present is like that during the revolutionary war against Dutch colonialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 25th: According to the Indonesian National News Agency, the United Islamic Teachers Association will agree to the composition of the National Council in President Sukarno's plan, that is: participation by political parties that have legal representation in Congress and groups that play a certain role in society.

The news agency said that some senior figures in the United Islamic Teachers Association "do not absolutely reject the organization of a cooperative cabinet including the Indonesian Communist Party."

It is reported that Muslim parties, including the United Islamic Teachers Association, are preparing to meet tonight to discuss their attitude towards the President's plan.

According to Antara News Agency, many parties, groups and individuals have issued statements expressing support for the President's plan. This includes the Wangsonegoro faction of the Greater Indonesia Unity Party.

Lieutenant Colonel Sumual, commander of the 7th Military District (in Sulawesi), also said that the President's plan emphasizes the realization of domestic peace, which is in line with the army's wishes.

According to today's Jakarta "People's Daily," Winarno Danuatmodjo, the Governor of South Sumatra Province, and Mirianu, the Mayor of Palembang, made speeches in favor of the plan. Former Army Chief of Staff Major General Bambang Utoyo said that the plan would change the turbulent situation in various regions. The South Sumatra Kuomintang and the Islamic Union Party organizations telegraphed the President to express their support for the plan.

People from all walks of life in South Sumatra will hold a mass rally on the 27th to support the President's plan.

    坚决支持苏加诺方案
    雅加达百余万人大示威
    苏加诺号召各党派团结起来组成合作内阁
    据新华社雅加达25日电　雅加达一百多万人在24日下午在独立宫前面举行示威，表示坚决支持苏加诺总统在三天前宣布的政治改革方案。示威群众给总统一篇书面声明，支持他的成立民族委员会和由全国一切力量组成的合作内阁的主张。声明要求全体爱国人民共同努力促使这个方案实现。
    苏加诺对人民的热烈支持表示感谢，他说，事情最后是要由全国八千二百万人民来决定的，因为他们知道甚么是正确的，甚么是错误的。他追溯说，当1945年宣布印度尼西亚共和国独立的时候，有些人曾反对过宣布独立。但是后来事实证明，正确的并不是这一小撮政治领袖，而是普遍支持宣布独立的全国占压倒多数的人民，而现在共和国已经稳固地站立了十一年。
    总统说，独立宣言的理想还没有完全实现，革命还没有完成，因为过去这个国家实行的民主制度是西方的民主，而西方的民主显然是不符合印度尼西亚人民的精神的。适合于印度尼西亚的是印度尼西亚式的民主，那就是，把所有政党和集团合并成一个大家庭，组成一个合作内阁。苏加诺说：“除了实现这个方案之外，我再也找不出克服目前困难的其他办法了。”
    总统重申他对任何集团都没有偏见，只是希望所有集团在一张桌子周围坐下来。苏加诺说，革命的团结是建立一个正义和繁荣的社会的必要条件。
    同时，更多的公众团体发表支持总统方案的声明。最近发表这种声明的团体中，有最大的种植园工人组织——印度尼西亚共和国种植园工人工会。
    要求实现总统方案的标语在街头出现得更多了，特别是在荷兰人公司的建筑物上贴得很多。雅加达人士说，目前在印度尼西亚首都洋溢的气氛好像在进行反对荷兰殖民主义的革命战争那个时期一样。
    据新华社雅加达25日电　据印度尼西亚民族通讯社报道，伊斯兰教师联合会将同意苏加诺总统方案中的民族委员会的组织成分，即：由在国会中拥有合法代表的各政党和在社会中有一定作用的团体参加。
    这家通讯社说，伊斯兰教师联合会的一些上层人物“并不绝对地拒绝组织包括印度尼西亚共产党在内的合作内阁”。
    据悉，包括伊斯兰教师联合会在内的穆斯林党派准备在今天晚上开会讨论他们对总统方案的态度。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，许多党派、团体和个人发表声明表示支持总统的方案。其中包括大印度尼西亚统一党的旺梭尼哥罗派。
    第七军区（在苏拉威西）司令苏穆阿尔中校也说，总统方案强调实现国内和平，这和陆军的愿望是一致的。
    另据今天雅加达的“人民日报”说，南苏门答腊省长威纳诺·达努阿莫佐和巨港市长米利安都发表谈话赞成这个方案。前陆军参谋长班邦·乌多约少将说，这个方案将会改变各地区的动乱局面。南苏门答腊国民党、伊斯兰联盟党的组织打电报给总统表示支持这个方案。
    南苏门答腊各阶层人民将在27日举行群众大会支持总统方案。
