Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 14th. The spring fishing season has begun in Guangdong. Fishermen in various ports are busy checking and replenishing their production tools, and arranging various types of operations to welcome the arrival of various fish schools.

The Guang'ao Fisheries Production Cooperative in Chaoyang County, which had a bumper harvest from its first voyage to the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian last April, is currently completing port procedures. It plans to send 800 members, forming four "艚" production teams, to set off again to the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang to intercept the southward-migrating yellow croaker schools. Fishermen in Aotou Port, Huiyang County, known for capturing whales with simple tools, have begun to discover whale migration in the Daya Bay fishing grounds and are actively pursuing them. Recently, they captured a whale weighing more than 3,000 kilograms.

The fish production during the spring fishing season in Guangdong's coastal areas accounts for about half of the total annual output. There are many types of fish, and the fishing season for each type varies in length, so it is necessary to carry out various types of operations. This year, the aquatic product leadership departments have reversed the past practice of only focusing on deep-sea production and neglecting shallow-sea production, and have strengthened leadership over the overall spring fishing season production. Around the Spring Festival, various coastal regions and counties held meetings one after another to summarize and exchange various operational techniques of fishermen in production. Various localities have also established fish school intelligence networks to monitor fish schools in order to timely organize port production and achieve "welcoming the head of the fish school and chasing the tail of the fish school." In the first ten days of this month, the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Department has issued 4.6 million yuan in fishery loans to help fishermen strive for a bumper harvest in the spring fishing season.

    广东春季鱼汛开始
    新华社广州14日电　广东春季鱼汛开始了。各港渔民正紧张地进行检查和添置生产工具，安排多种作业生产，迎接各类鱼群的到来。
    去年4月第一次远航到浙江、福建沿海捕鱼获得丰收的潮阳县广澳渔业生产合作社，这两天正在办理过港手续，准备派出八百名社员，组成四个?艚生产队，再度出发到闽、浙沿海一带，迎捕南游的黄花鱼群。以简陋工具捕捉鲸鱼闻名的惠阳县澳头港渔民，在大亚湾渔场开始发现了鲸鱼洄游，纷纷进行追捕。最近，他们已捕获一条重三千多斤的鲸鱼。
    广东沿海春季鱼汛期间的鱼产量约占全年总产量的一半，鱼类较多，各种鱼类的汛期长短不一，因此要进行多种作业生产。今年，水产领导部门扭转了过去只重视深海、忽视浅海生产的思想，对春汛的全面生产加强了领导。春节前后，沿海各专区、县都先后召开会议，总结和交流渔民在生产上的各种作业技术。各地并且建立了鱼汛情报网，监视鱼群，以便及时组织过港生产，做到“迎鱼头、追鱼尾”。本月上旬，广东省水产厅已发放了四百六十万元渔业贷款，帮助渔民力争春汛丰收。
