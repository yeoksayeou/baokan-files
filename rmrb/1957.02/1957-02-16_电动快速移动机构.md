    Electric Quick Traverse Mechanism

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory successfully tested an electric quick traverse mechanism – a power device to drive the tool holder for cutting – on the IK36 lathe on January 20th, during the improvement of machine tool design.

    The previous transmission mechanism consisted of more than two hundred parts, including gears, seamless steel pipes, and rollers; it was bulky, complex, and inconvenient to manufacture. The factory's design department improved the design of this mechanism from three aspects: saving steel, reducing auxiliary man-hours, and improving machine tool performance. At the same time, referring to the advantages of similar devices on advanced foreign machine tools, they boldly eliminated one hundred and sixty kinds of valuable parts, such as seamless steel pipes and rollers, from the original design, and used a 0.6 kW motor and a small gearbox to undertake the transmission device of all the gears in the past. After testing, it was proved that the weight of each machine tool was reduced by one hundred and thirty kilograms, the cost was reduced by about three hundred yuan, and because the parts were simpler, operation, inspection, and maintenance were more convenient than before.

    After technical appraisal, the factory has affirmed this new design. It is expected that the new electric quick traverse mechanism will be installed on the IK36 lathes produced in the second quarter. (Wen)

    电动快速移动机构
    本报讯　沈阳第三机床厂在改进机床设计中，1月20日试验成功一种装置在IK36车床上的电动快速移动机构——一种带动刀架进行切削加工的动力装置。
    过去的传动机构，是由齿轮、无缝钢管、滚轴等二百多种零件组成的；笨重，复杂，生产起来不方便。这个厂的设计科从节约钢材、减少辅助工时、提高机床性能等三方面来改进这一机构设计，同时参考了外国先进机床类似装置的优点，大胆地取消了原有设计中的无缝钢管、滚珠等一百六十种贵重零件，以一个零点六瓩的马达和小变速箱承担了过去全部齿轮的传动装置。经过试验证明：每台机床体重减轻了一百三十公斤，成本降低了三百元左右，而且由于零件简单，操作、检查、维修都比过去方便。
    经过技术鉴定，该厂已肯定了这项新设计，预计在第二季度出产的IK36车床上，就将装置这种新的电动快速移动机构了。　（文）
