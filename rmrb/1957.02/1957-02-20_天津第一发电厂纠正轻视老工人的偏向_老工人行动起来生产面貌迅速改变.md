Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric Report, Xinhua News Agency reporter Shu Ti reports: After the veteran workers took active action, the long-term backward production outlook of Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant underwent rapid changes.

This factory has ninety-one veteran workers with ten to forty years of service. They have rich work experience and high technical skills. Shi Dechang and Xu Changyou, who are famous for repairing generator rotors or stators, have assisted in repairing generator or boiler auxiliary equipment in many power plants across the country. However, in the past, this factory did not give enough importance to this force. Some leading cadres of the factory had some one-sided views on the veteran workers. They believed that the veteran workers were unwilling to attend meetings, did not grasp the leaders' intentions as quickly as the young workers, and the veteran workers would retire in a few years and were not the objects to rely on. Some cadres even believed that veteran workers' rationalization proposals were aimed at winning bonuses, and therefore rarely supported them. The work arrangements for veteran workers were also inappropriate, and even some sixth-grade workers were assigned to do the work of second-grade workers. The enthusiasm of the veteran workers could not be fully utilized, the technical improvement of the young workers was hindered, the entire factory could not complete or fully complete the state plan for a long time, and machine accidents increased year by year.

This serious situation attracted the attention of the higher-level Party committee. The former Tianjin Electric Power Bureau Committee specially sent a resident work team to assist the Party organization of this factory in conducting an inspection. When they organized forces to conduct a thorough investigation and analysis of the factory's veteran workers, they found that many veteran workers still loved the factory even when they were not valued. Some veteran workers, whenever there were strong winds and heavy rains late at night, would think that some part of the factory might be unsafe, so they would get up quickly and run to the factory, and only go back to sleep after seeing that everything was fine. It is even more common for veteran workers to be consistently punctual and not absent from work, late or leaving early. Through this thorough investigation, the factory's leading cadres changed their one-sided views on the veteran workers and realized the importance of relying on the veteran workers; at the same time, they also realized that some shortcomings of the veteran workers could be overcome through education. Subsequently, the Party organization actively carried out education on valuing veteran workers among young workers and cadres. Leading cadres also visited the families of veteran workers and talked with them. When the Party organizations at all levels within the factory discussed production and other issues, they absorbed some veteran workers to participate. When the administrative side formulated production plans and studied key production issues, they also absorbed them to participate. In addition, some inappropriate arrangements for veteran workers were also readjusted.

After a series of changes were made in the leadership, the enthusiasm of the veteran workers was greatly improved. In order to solve the key problems in the factory's production, they often studied until after 10 o'clock after work. On Sundays, they sometimes braved heavy rain to conduct collective research in the factory. Yang Xiuyan and other veteran workers in the repair and distribution workshop used waste materials accumulated bit by bit in the factory to make a conveyor belt and sixty repair tools in their spare time. The implementation of a rationalization proposal by veteran worker Shen A'fa saved the factory 540,000 kWh of electricity. For more than ten years, two generators in the factory had been forced to limit power generation every summer due to excessive internal machine temperatures; after research by veteran workers Shi Defa, Xu Changyou, and Deputy Director of Maintenance Pan Shihua, both reached the design capacity of the machines. In the one month or so since the launch of the increased production and conservation campaign, veteran workers have put forward many technical measures regarding safe power generation, reducing coal consumption, and saving plant power consumption. The entire factory comprehensively overfulfilled the January production task and has not experienced a single machine accident.

    天津第一发电厂纠正轻视老工人的偏向
    老工人行动起来生产面貌迅速改变
    新华社天津电　新华社记者舒倜报道：当老工人们积极行动起来以后，天津第一发电厂长期落后的生产面貌便起了迅速的变化。
    这个工厂有九十一位十年到四十年工龄的老工人。他们有丰富的工作经验和较高的技术能力。以检修发电机转子或静子著名的师德成、徐长有等，曾经到全国许多发电厂协助检修发电机或锅炉的附属设备。但是在过去，这个工厂却没有重用这一支力量。工厂的有些领导干部对老工人存在一些片面的看法，他们认为，老工人不愿开会，不像青年工人那样很快地领会领导意图，老工人待几年就要退休，不是依靠的对象；有些干部，甚至连老工人提合理化建议都认为是想得奖金，因而很少给以支持。对老工人的工作安排也不妥当，甚至有的六级工被分配去做二级工做的活。老工人的积极性得不到充分发挥，青年工人的技术的提高受到阻碍，整个工厂在长时期不能完成或不能全面完成国家计划，机器事故逐年上升。
    这种严重情况，引起了上级党委的重视。前中共天津电业局委员会特地派出一个驻厂工作组，协助这个厂的党组织进行检查。当他们组织力量对全厂老工人进行摸底和分析的时候，发现很多老工人，即使在不被重用的时候，仍然热爱着工厂。有些老工人每当刮风下雨的深夜，想到工厂某个部分可能不安全，就赶紧起来跑到工厂，看到没事以后，才回去睡觉。常年不缺勤、不迟到早退，更是老工人中的普遍现象。经过摸底，也发现老工人存在一些缺点。比如有些人由于自己的经验较多，工厂中推广一些先进经验，开始时有较大的抵触情绪等。通过这次摸底，工厂的领导干部才改变了对老工人的片面看法，认识到依靠老工人的重要性；同时也认识到老工人中的一些缺点，经过教育是可以克服的。随后，党组织便积极地在青年工人、干部中进行重视老工人的教育。领导干部又访问了老工人的家庭，同老工人谈心。厂内的各级党组织，在讨论生产等问题的时候，吸收一部分老工人参加。行政方面制定生产计划和研究生产关键问题的时候，也吸收他们参加。此外，对一些老工人安排不当的也重新作了调整。
    在领导方面作了一系列的转变以后，老工人们的积极性便大大提高。为了解决工厂生产当中的关键问题，他们往往在下班以后，研究到十点多钟。在星期天，有时冒着大雨，还到工厂里进行集体研究。修配分场的老工人杨秀岩等，利用平时在工厂一点一滴积累起来的废料，在业余时间制成了一部传送带和六十件检修工具。老工人沈阿法的一项合理化建议的实现，就使工厂节约厂用电五十四万度。工厂有两部发电机，十多年来，每到夏天，都由于机器内部温度过高，被迫限制发电；经过老工人师德法、徐长有和检修副主任潘士华三人研究，都达到了机器的设计能力。增产节约运动开展后的一个多月中，老工人已经提出了许多关于安全发电、降低煤耗、节约厂用电等技术措施，全厂全面超额完成了1月份生产任务，并且没有发生过一次机器事故。
