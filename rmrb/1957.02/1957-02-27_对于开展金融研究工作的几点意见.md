Several Suggestions on Carrying out Financial Research Work
    Zeng Ling, Yang Peixin

According to materials reflected by the editorial department of "China Finance" and other sources, many comrades working in the banking system are very concerned about carrying out financial research work and advancing towards science. However, at the same time, there are still many ideological issues. For example, why and how to carry out financial research work, whether comrades who have not done research work in the past can and how to start research work, etc. We now put forward some opinions for comrades to study and refer to.

    I. Why carry out financial research work

We believe that the purpose of carrying out financial research work should be to continuously improve our country's financial work.

The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China declared the basic victory of China's socialist revolution and pointed out the main contradictions of socialist construction in the future. In the past, financial work actively played its role in coordinating the task of resolving "who will defeat whom." In the future, it needs to coordinate with the new political and economic situation to further improve its work. Facing the new situation, we are beginning to come into contact with many new problems. Such as:

In terms of settlement work: Is it possible to simplify settlement procedures? Should banks simultaneously undertake the tasks of settlement notarization, deduction, and supervision in settlement?

In terms of credit work: How should credit quotas be controlled? Some commodities are sometimes overstocked and sometimes out of stock. How should our "red light" signal be displayed? Is it necessary for banks to participate in quotas to reflect credit supervision? What impact does the emergence of the free market have on credit plans?

In terms of currency circulation and cash management: After the opening of the free market in some large cities, there is more cash injection and less withdrawal, resulting in a large difference. Is this reasonable or unreasonable? The amount of currency injected in rural areas has increased, and a small number of farmers have savings of one or two hundred yuan in Renminbi that they do not use temporarily. Is this currency "sedimentation" phenomenon healthy or unhealthy? What changes have taken place in rural currency circulation after agricultural cooperation and the opening of the free market?

In terms of rural financial work: What changes have taken place in the supply and demand relationship of rural funds after agricultural cooperation? How should agricultural loans and credit cooperative work adapt to this change?

In terms of savings work: Can internal accounting procedures be simplified? Will this have a certain effect on "convenient deposit and withdrawal" and avoiding queuing? Can savings checks be appropriately opened?

This series of questions also involves deeper issues, such as: In terms of the financial system, how to combine centralized management with giving play to local initiative? In the implementation of fund management and systems and methods, how to reflect local flexibility? In the financial system, is it necessary to set up other specialized banks besides unified state banks? How to treat the Soviet Union's experience in this regard? What changes have taken place in credit cooperatives in the development process of agricultural cooperation? What are the basic tasks of the state bank during the Second Five-Year Plan period? Is the nature of the state bank an agency or an enterprise?

The problems that have already appeared or are about to appear in real life are far more than those listed above.

The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that overcoming subjectivism in ideological understanding is the fundamental key to ensuring the smooth development of work and avoiding major errors. It warned us not to replace investigation with empty talk, formulate policies based on feelings, but to go deep into the lower levels, painstakingly study new things, and correctly support the development of new things. This requires us to strengthen the investigation and research of actual situations. Carrying out scientific research on major problems in financial work and finding out the laws of objective things can help leading organs at all levels and the vast number of workers avoid subjectivism and formulate and implement correct guidelines and policies. As long as we do not adopt a bureaucratic attitude, we will find that there are many new problems in the work we are engaged in, and these are precisely the topics that our actual work and scientific research need to solve.

Therefore, we believe that some people narrow the purpose of carrying out scientific research work and advancing towards science only to cultivating a few doctors and associate doctors. This understanding is very incomplete. In the process of carrying out scientific research work, many doctors and associate doctors with both theoretical cultivation and practical work experience, as well as many workers with university degrees or secondary school diplomas, may emerge in the future; but this is not the ultimate goal of scientific research work, and in fact, the state cannot grant degrees to all people engaged in scientific research work. The purpose of scientific research can only be to help us overcome subjectivism by studying the objective laws of the development of things, so as to correctly formulate and implement various guidelines, policies, systems, and methods in banking work, so as to correctly exert the active role of financial work in socialist construction. We hope that the comrades in our banking system can, in the long-term painstaking study in the future, and in the actual struggle, be able to emerge many economists, monetary scientists, bankers, and excellent financial workers with considerable Marxist-Leninist theoretical level, rich struggle experience, and a certain scientific level. This is an important guarantee for the smooth development of our work. But this is not our ultimate goal. Our purpose is to do financial work even more and even better.

    II. What aspects does financial research work include

Financial research work needs to revolve around current major issues, and strive from the three aspects of "investigation and research," "reviewing the past to know the new," and "learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries."

Conducting investigation and research on the current economic situation and financial work situation is the basic aspect of scientific research work. For example, if we want to study credit and settlement issues, we must better investigate the changing laws of socialist industry and commerce and their opinions and requirements on credit work; to study rural currency and credit issues, we must investigate the situation of agricultural production, the income and expenditure of farmers, and so on. At the same time, it is necessary to conduct detailed and specific analysis and research on the basis of investigation. But at the same time, we must also adopt the methods of "reviewing the past to know the new" and "learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries." "Reviewing the past to know the new" is to conduct a consistent historical investigation of things, so as to deeply understand the laws of the development of things. Our country's financial work has historical origins, and various financial problems also have a consistent development process. To correctly understand today, it is necessary to look at yesterday and the day before yesterday. Because the longer the period of investigation, the clearer the laws of things are revealed, which can help us avoid looking at problems in isolation and one-sidedly.

First of all, we must review the "past" of the past seven years. That is to say, we must summarize the experience and lessons of financial work during the socialist revolution period and the resolution of various financial problems, and study its objective laws of development. Our current work system and policies have been gradually formed in the past seven years. In the seven years of the socialist revolution process, in order to solve the task of "who will defeat whom," banking work has actively played its role. For example, in stabilizing currency, restoring and developing production, combating capitalist speculation, strengthening the leading force of the state-owned economy from the perspective of capital supply, utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist finance and industry and commerce, and supporting and promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, banking work has achieved great achievements and rich experience, and has also gained some lessons from failures. The summary of this period of history is helpful to our future work.

Secondly, we must review the "past" of twenty years. That is to say, we must summarize the financial work experience in the people's democratic revolution process from 1929 to 1949. For example, the experience of each liberated area in establishing a monetary base, fighting against enemy currency, stabilizing currency, supporting the revolutionary war, issuing agricultural loans, and supporting agricultural production. These experiences once benefited the advancement of financial work since the founding of the country, and are also the precious buds and beginnings of our country's national financial work. Many of the valuable experiences, after summarizing and theoretical improvement, are still beneficial to our future work.

Again, we must review the "past" of one hundred years. That is to say, we must specifically analyze the development of the old China's financial industry from the Opium War to 1949. Summarizing the development of the old China's financial industry in the past century is of significance to us in theoretical and business aspects. In the study of modern Chinese history, modern Chinese economic history occupies a very important position, and modern Chinese financial history is an important part of modern Chinese economic history. We must study the imperialist financial control over China, the financial monopoly of bureaucratic capitalism, the financial division of feudal warlords, and the dying national capitalist financial industry, and provide specific analysis in conjunction with the political and economic situation at that time. This is the significance in theoretical aspects. Some systems of banking work in the old China accepted some things from foreign countries and inherited some traditions of the Chinese silver industry, and at the same time simplified and created these, so as to facilitate the past industry and commerce. In fact, many of these systems were formulated and revised by financial practitioners and some experts based on practical work experience, or were customary practices, such as remittance, transfer, and bill exchange systems, which were relatively simple. This is a wealth, and we should not completely discard it. We must conduct specific research, select the good parts and transform them, and not completely abandon them simply because the nature of financial work in New China is fundamentally different from the financial system in the old China. We can do some work to remove the dross and select the essence, which will be conducive to preserving and inheriting the national heritage in financial work.

In the process of reviewing the past, we can also trace back to the "past" of thousands of years, such as studying the history of Chinese currency, etc. These are all meaningful in academic terms. These tasks require us to proceed gradually from near to far, according to needs and possibilities.

Learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries is still an extremely important reference for our scientific research. But it should be pointed out:

First, we must learn the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries in depth, and not simply copy it. The development of financial work in the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries has common things, such as bank nationalization, stable currency system, and gradual reform of the credit and settlement system. This is because the economic development laws of the transition period in various countries have a common aspect. However, due to the different specific historical conditions of various countries, the development process of financial work cannot be completely the same. For example, our country has achieved bank nationalization through the road of redemption, adopted the method of stabilizing prices before issuing new currencies to stabilize currency, and the transformation of our country's credit and settlement system must also adapt to the characteristics of our country's socialist industry and commerce, and so on. Some books introducing foreign experience only talk about banking business technology in isolation, and do not mention the political and economic conditions at that time, which is very insufficient for our country's readers. We should first thoroughly understand the development process of financial work in various countries, the objective conditions at that time, and the characteristics of their policies, systems, and methods, and then master the laws. As for whether these methods need to be adopted, it should be based on the actual situation in our country. In this regard, we must oppose the dogmatic attitude. We must not only know how people do it, but also know why people do it; we must not only understand the development process of their financial work, but also understand the political and economic background behind this development process.

Second, the Soviet experience is one of the main objects of our study, but we must also learn from the experience of other people's democratic countries; we must learn from successful experiences, and we must also draw lessons from failures. We should learn from the experience of socialist countries, and we should also pay attention to the dynamics of capitalist countries, such as the financial measures of Asian and African countries in the process of striving for national independence, as well as the financial dynamics and financial aggression of imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France. Studying these issues is helpful for criticizing modern capitalist monetary banking theories, exposing the contradictions of the capitalist economy, enriching Marxist political economy, and determining the guidelines, policies, and practices of our country's foreign exchange work.

We believe that studying our country's financial work and important financial issues from several aspects such as ancient, modern, Chinese, and foreign (with today's China as the main focus) is an indispensable aspect of expanding our horizons and systematically and deeply carrying out financial research work.

These financial research work can be carried out not only in the senior leading organs of financial work, but also by comrades working in financial institutions at the provincial, county, and township levels. For example, making a systematic investigation and research on the financial situation of a province, a county, a district, a township, a department, an agricultural cooperative, a factory, or a store, and linking it to banking work, has great scientific significance. At the same time, comrades working in financial institutions at the provincial, county, and township levels can also carry out "reviewing the past" work. They can summarize the experience of a certain financial work in a province, a county, a district, or a township, as a basis for carrying out financial research work, so as to achieve the purpose of improving work.

    III. On mastering basic theoretical knowledge and other issues

Some comrades working at the grassroots level have raised the question: I lack basic theoretical knowledge about banking work, so I ask to introduce some books so that I can master some basic theoretical knowledge and common sense. In this regard, we feel that: First of all, we must emphasize the study of the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism (including socialism, philosophy, and political economy), study textbooks of Marxism-Leninism and some classic works, and avoid plunging into some books that simply talk about the technological development of banking business from the beginning.

Mastering the basic knowledge of socialism, philosophy, and political economy of Marxism-Leninism, in addition to reading some textbooks, you can also try to read some classic works. For example, studying Marx's "Critique of Political Economy" is very important for learning monetary theory. For those who are learning, listing many professional bibliographies (such as the monetary circulation profession, etc.) and recommending all the works on the profession published by the Soviet Union without selection, we think is not necessarily completely appropriate. If you think that you have mastered the knowledge of monetary circulation by reading these books thoroughly, it may lead to dogmatism and a business viewpoint that is divorced from politics.

Some people think that in the stage of mastering scientific knowledge, you can only read books, and then conduct research work after the theoretical foundation is laid. This view is not very appropriate either. If you are required to be proficient in Marxism before doing scientific research work, I am afraid that many people have to put down their pens and bury themselves in reading. Investigation and research work itself is a kind of practice, an application of theory, which can help us better understand theory, make us understand it more specifically and deeply, and combine rational knowledge with perceptual knowledge. Therefore, we believe that we should study and research at the same time, and be good at linking with reality and conducting investigation and research work when studying.

Some people think that doing investigation and collecting materials is meaningless, despise these works, and are willing to take some time to read classic works, thinking that reading well and memorizing well can get a degree. At present, some people are willing to engage in research, but are unwilling to sort out materials and are unwilling to conduct investigations. This is also an unrealistic idea. To study, you need to occupy materials and conduct meticulous investigations. Without investigation, there is no right to speak. To study, you need to occupy written historical materials. Without sorting out materials, it is impossible to carry out research work. Therefore, we should overcome this habit of being ambitious and unrealistic, and earnestly carry out investigation and material organization work to create a solid foundation for research work.

    对于开展金融研究工作的几点意见
    曾凌　杨培新
    根据“中国金融”编辑部和其它方面反映的材料，目前在银行系统工作的许多同志，对于开展金融研究工作和向科学进军都是很关心的，但同时思想上也还存在着不少的问题。例如，为什么和怎样展开金融研究工作，过去没有做过研究工作的同志能否和如何着手进行研究工作等。我们现在提出一些意见，供同志们研究参考。
    一、为什么要开展金融研究工作
    我们认为，开展金融研究工作的目的，应该是为了不断提高和改进我们国家的金融工作。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，宣告了中国社会主义革命的基本胜利，并指出了今后社会主义建设的主要矛盾。金融工作过去配合解决“谁战胜谁”的任务，积极发挥了它的作用，今后需要配合新的政治经济形势，进一步做好工作。面临着新的形势，我们开始接触到许多新的问题。如：
    在结算工作方面：可否简化结算手续？银行在结算中是否应同时担负结算的公证、扣款、监督等任务？
    在信贷工作方面：信贷方面定额应如何掌握？有些商品时而积压，时而脱销，我们的“红灯”信号怎么挂？银行有无必要为体现信贷监督而参加定额？自由市场出现后，对信贷计划有什么影响？
    在货币流通和现金出纳工作方面：有些大城市在自由市场开放后，现金投放多、回笼少、差额大，这是合理的还是不合理的？农村地区投放的货币增多，有一小部分农民手中存有一、二百元人民币暂时不用，这种货币“沉淀”现象究竟是健康的还是不健康的？农业合作化和自由市场开放后，对农村货币流通发生了哪些变化？
    在农村金融工作方面：农村资金的供求关系在农业合作化后起了什么变化？农业放款、信用合作工作如何适应这种变化？
    在储蓄工作方面：内部账务处理手续是否可以简化？这对“存取方便”同避免排队现象是否可起一定作用？储蓄支票是否可以适当开放？
    这一系列问题还牵涉到更深入一层的问题，如：金融体制上，中央集中管理同发挥地方积极性如何结合？在资金管理及制度办法的执行上，如何体现地方的机动灵活性？在金融体系中，除统一的国家银行外，是否有必要设置其它的专业银行？如何对待苏联在这方面的经验？信用合作社在农业合作化发展过程中有什么变化？国家银行在第二个五年计划时期的基本任务是什么？国家银行的性质是机关还是企业？
    实际生活中已经出现或即将出现的问题，还远比上面所列举的要多。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，指出克服思想认识上的主观主义，是保证工作顺利发展，避免重大错误的根本关键；警告我们不要用空谈代替调查，由感想制定政策，而要深入下层，刻苦地研究新鲜事物，并正确地支持新鲜事物的发展。这就要求我们加强对于实际情况的调查研究工作。对金融工作中发生的重大问题开展科学研究，找出客观事物发展规律，能够帮助各级领导机关和广大工作人员避免主观主义，制定和执行正确的方针、政策。只要我们不抱着官僚主义的态度，就会发现自己所从事的工作中有许多新问题，而这也正是我们实际工作和科学研究所要解决的课题。
    因此，我们认为，有些人把开展科学研究工作和向科学进军的目的，仅仅缩小为培养若干博士、副博士，这种理解是很不完全的。在开展科学研究工作过程中，将来可能出现不少有理论修养又有实际工作经验的博士和副博士，以及许多具有大学程度或中等学校毕业程度的工作者；但这并不是科学研究工作的最终目的，而且事实上国家也不可能对所有从事科学研究工作的人都授予学位。科学研究的目的，只能是通过研究事物发展的客观规律，帮助我们克服主观主义，以正确地制定和执行银行工作中各项方针、政策、制度和办法，从而正确地发挥金融工作对社会主义建设的积极作用。我们希望我们银行系统的工作同志们，在今后长期刻苦钻研过程中，在实际斗争中，能够涌现出许许多多的具有相当的马克思列宁主义理论水平、丰富的斗争经验和有一定科学水平的经济学家、货币学家、银行家和优秀的金融工作者，这是我们工作得以顺利发展的重要保证。但这不是我们的最终目的，我们的目的是要把金融工作做得更多更好。
    二、金融研究工作有哪些方面
    金融研究工作，需要围绕着当前的重大问题，从“调查研究”、“温故而知新”、“学习苏联和其它国家先进经验”三个方面来努力。
    对当前的经济情况和金融工作情况进行调查研究，是科学研究工作的基本方面。例如，我们要研究信贷结算问题，就必须更好地调查社会主义工商业情况的变化规律和他们对信贷工作的意见、要求；研究农村的货币、信贷问题，就要调查农业生产的情况、农民收支的情况等等。同时需要在调查的基础上进行细致、具体的分析研究。但同时也要采用“温故而知新”、“学习苏联和其它国家的先进经验”的方法。“温故而知新”是对事物作历史的一贯的考察，从而深刻地了解事物发展的规律。我国金融工作是有历史渊源的，各种金融问题也是有它一贯发展的过程，要正确理解今天，就有必要看看昨天和前天。因为考察的时期愈长远，事物的规律就愈暴露得清楚，可以帮助我们避免孤立、片面地看问题。
    首先，我们要温以往七年来的“故”。这就是说我们要总结社会主义革命时期的金融工作以及解决各种金融问题的经验、教训，并研究其发展的客观规律。我们今天的工作制度、政策，是七年来逐步形成的，在社会主义革命的七年过程中，为了解决“谁战胜谁”的任务，银行工作积极发挥了它的作用。例如在稳定通货、恢复和发展生产、打击资本主义投机方面，从资金供应上壮大国营经济领导力量方面，在利用、限制、改造资本主义金融业和工商业方面，在支持和促进农业、手工业社会主义改造方面，银行工作都获得了很大的成绩和丰富的经验，同时也取得了一些失败的教训。对于这一段历史的总结，对于我们今后进行工作是有帮助的。
    其次，我们要温二十年的“故”。这就是说，我们要总结自1929年至1949年这二十年间的人民民主革命过程中的金融工作经验。例如，每个解放区在建立货币阵地、同敌币作斗争、稳定货币、支持革命战争，发放农业放款、支持农业生产的经验等等。这些经验曾经有益于建国以来金融工作的推进，也是我国国家金融工作宝贵的萌芽和开端，其中许多宝贵的经验，经过总结和理论上的提高后，仍有益于我们今后工作的开展。
    再次，我们要温一百年的“故”。这就是说，我们要具体分析鸦片战争以来到1949年为止旧中国金融事业发展的情况。总结近百年来的旧中国金融事业的发展，对于我们具有理论上和业务上的各个方面的意义。在中国近代史的研究中，中国近代经济史占很重要的地位，而中国近代金融史又是中国近代经济史的重要部分。我们要研究帝国主义对中国的金融控制，官僚资本主义的金融垄断，封建军阀的金融割据和民族资本主义金融业的奄奄一息，并结合当时政治经济情况提供具体的分析，这是理论方面的意义。旧中国银行工作的若干制度，接受了外国的一些东西，也继承了中国银钱业的一些传统，同时对这些又都有所简化和创造，从而使过去的工商业感到方便。这类制度，实际上有许多是金融从业职工和部分专家根据实际工作经验制定和修订的，或是约定俗成的，如汇兑、转账、票据交换等制度，都是较简便的。这是一笔财富，我们不应该一笔抹煞，完全丢弃。我们要具体地进行研究，选择其中好的部分加以改造，而不能因为新中国金融工作与旧中国金融制度在性质上根本不同，就把它们完全抛弃。我们做一些去粗存精的工作，就可以有利于保存和继承金融工作中的民族遗产。
    在温故过程中，我们还可以追溯到数千年的“故”，如研究中国货币史等等，这些在学术上都是有意义的。这些工作需要我们根据需要和可能，由近及远，逐步进行。
    学习苏联和其它国家的先进经验，仍然是我们进行科学研究中极其重要的借镜。但应该指出：
    第一、学习苏联和其它国家的先进经验，一定要深入地学习，不要照搬。苏联、中国和其它人民民主国家金融工作的发展有共同的东西，如银行国有化、稳定货币制度、逐步改革信贷结算制度等。这是因为各国的过渡时期经济发展规律有共同性的一面。但是由于各国具体的历史条件的不同，金融工作发展过程便不能完全相同，例如我国经过赎买的道路实现银行国有化，采取先稳定物价后换发新币的方法来稳定通货，我国信贷结算制度改造也要适应我国社会主义工商业的特点等等。有些介绍外国经验的书籍，只是孤立地讲银行业务技术，未提当时的政治经济条件，对于我国的读者是很不够的。应先把各国金融工作发展的过程、当时的客观条件及其政策、制度、办法的特点彻底搞清，融会贯通，摸出规律。至于是否需要采取这些办法，则应从我国的实际情况出发。在这方面，必须反对教条主义的态度。不仅要知道人家是怎样做的，而且要知道人家为什么这样做；不仅要了解其金融工作发展经过，而且要了解这发展过程背后的政治经济背景。
    第二、苏联经验是我们学习的主要对象之一，但我们对其它人民民主国家的经验也要学习；成功的经验要学习，失败的教训也要吸取。社会主义国家的经验要借镜，资本主义国家的动态，如亚非国家在争取民族独立过程中的金融措施，以及美、英、法等帝国主义国家的金融动态和金融侵略情况也要注意。研究这些问题，对于批判现代资本主义的货币银行学说，揭露资本主义经济的矛盾，丰富马克思主义的政治经济学，以及决定我国外汇工作的方针、政策和做法都有帮助。
    我们认为从古、今、中、外等几个方面（其中又以中国的今天为主）来研究我国的金融工作和重要金融问题，是扩大我们眼界，系统地、深入地展开金融研究工作不可缺少的几个方面。
    这些金融研究工作，不但是在金融工作的高级领导机构中能够进行，即在省、县、乡一级金融机构中工作的同志也能够进行。例如，对一个省、一个县、一个区、一个乡、一个部门、一个农业社、一个工厂、一个商店的资金情况作系统的调查研究，并联系到银行工作，就有很大的科学意义。同时，在省、县、乡一级金融机构工作的同志也能进行“温故”的工作，他们可以总结一省、一县、一区、一乡的某一项金融工作的经验，以这作为开展金融研究工作的基础，达到改进工作的目的。
    三、关于掌握基本理论知识及其它问题
    有些基层工作的同志提出：我缺乏关于银行工作的基本理论知识，因此我要求介绍几本书，让我掌握一些基本理论知识和常识。在这方面我们觉得：首先要强调学习马克思列宁主义的基础知识（包括社会主义、哲学、政治经济学），学习马克思列宁主义的教科书和一些经典著作，而避免一开始就钻在一些单纯讲银行业务技术发展的书籍里面。
    掌握马克思列宁主义的社会主义的、哲学的和政治经济学的基本知识，除了读一些教科书外，也可尝试着读些经典著作。如学习马克思的“政治经济学批判”，这对于学习货币理论就是很重要的。对于学习的人，开列许多专业书目（例如货币流通专业等），把苏联出版的关于专业的所有著作不加挑选地全部推荐，我们认为不一定是完全妥当的。如果认为熟读了这些书籍就算是了解了货币流通知识，就有可能导致教条主义和脱离政治的业务观点。
    有些人认为，在掌握科学知识的阶段只能读书，等到理论基础打好后再进行研究工作。这个看法也不很妥当。如果要求精通马克思主义以后，才来作科学研究工作，那恐怕许多人只好搁下笔来，埋头读书。调查研究工作本身就是一种实践，是理论的一种应用，它能帮助我们更好地了解理论，使我们理解得更具体而深刻，使理性知识同感性知识结合起来。因此，我们认为应当边学习边研究，在学习时就应善于联系实际，进行调查研究工作。
    有人认为搞调查、搞资料没有什么意思，轻视这些工作，愿意抽出些时间读经典著作，认为读得好，背得熟，才能考取学位。目前有些人愿意搞研究，但不愿整理资料，不愿作调查。这也是不切合实际的想法。要研究就需要占有材料，进行细密的调查。没有调查便没有发言权。要研究便要占有书面的历史的材料，不整理材料便不可能进行研究工作。因此，我们应该克服这种好高鹜远的习气，切实地进行调查和整理资料工作，为研究工作创造坚实的基础。
