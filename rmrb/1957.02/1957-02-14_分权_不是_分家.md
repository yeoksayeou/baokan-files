Editorial Notes:

	The agricultural cooperative's management committee should specifically lead production; cooperative cadres should not just sit in the office and talk about leadership. However, no matter how specific the leadership is, it should still be leadership and not taking over everything.
	Each production team in an agricultural cooperative is a component of the entire cooperative. However, it must not be forgotten that it is the basic production unit of the agricultural cooperative.
	To fully promote the initiative of each production team and to avoid the management committee from taking over the affairs of the production teams, the powers of the management committee and the production teams should be clearly divided. The Ya'hou Village Agricultural Cooperative has clearly demarcated the boundaries between the management committee and the production teams in terms of production planning and financial management; some agricultural cooperatives in other places have also done this. This is a step forward in the management and operation of agricultural cooperatives.
	It should be noted that production teams are not, after all, individual "small cooperatives," and "decentralization" should not be "division of the family property." After decentralization, the management committee is not so busy and should learn more about the specific situation of each team, strengthen leadership, and pay attention to reasonably adjusting the relationship between the teams when necessary. Each team should also always care about the interests of the entire cooperative and always be vigilant against localism.

### “分权”不是“分家”

    “分权”不是“分家”
    农业社的管理委员会应该具体地领导生产，社干部不可只是坐在办公室里空谈领导。可是，领导无论怎样具体，都应该是领导，而不应该是包办代替。
    农业社的各个生产队都是全社的一个组成部分。可是，也不能忘记，它是农业社的基本生产单位。
    要使各个生产队充分发扬主动精神，要避免管委会对生产队的事情包办代替，就应该明确划分管委会和生产队之间的权限。崖后村农业社在生产计划、财务管理等方面明确地划分了管委会和生产队分权管理的界限；别的地方有些农业社也这样做了。这是在农业社的经营管理方面向前跨进了一步。
    应该注意的是：生产队毕竟不是一个个的“小社”，“分权”也不应该是“分家”。分权之后，管委会不那么忙乱了，应该更多了解各个队的具体情况，加强领导，并且注意在必要的时候合理调节各队之间的关系。各个队也应该时时关心全社的利益，时时警惕不要发生本位主义的毛病。
