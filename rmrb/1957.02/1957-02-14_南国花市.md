　　“The east wind sways, cherry trees and plum trees burst into bloom.” With the gentle and warm spring breeze, flowers bloom everywhere on the earth. At this time, it is easy to recall the ancient Chinese legends of "a county of flowers" and "Hibiscus City." The flower market in Guangzhou on New Year's Eve is even more beautiful than the scenes in historical legends. Having lived in Guangzhou for these years, I always have to squeeze into the annual flower market and shed a few drops of sweat. On this night, it seems that many Guangzhou people have the kind of "holding up a flower and smiling" demeanor mentioned in Buddhism.

　　Guangzhou is a city where flowers bloom all year round. I really don’t know when the Bauhinia among the woody plants and the gladiolus among the herbaceous plants don’t bloom. Small flower stalls are densely scattered everywhere on ordinary days, but the large-scale flower market only happens once a year. Precisely because it is once a year, the grandeur is even more beautiful. The geographical environment enables Guangzhou to welcome the spring breeze first, becoming the city with the most flowers in the country. Because that northern tropic line that reminds people of warmth passes not far north of Guangzhou! I remember that Soviet literature mentioned a flower there called "primrose" (different from the magnolia called "primrose" in some parts of China), which blooms with small bell-like flowers. Russian folk legends believe that when the spring breeze blows, these small bells in the fields shake their heads, calling to the earth: "Blooming, blooming, spring is coming." Guangdong has a special famous flower called "hanging bell flower," and each flower stamen can grow about ten upside-down bell-like flowers. It is as if they are also messengers of spring, ringing their little bells to report the spring news, and then, the goose-yellow and tender green, the myriad purples and reds all awaken, and in an instant, the earth is covered with a flower scarf.

　　There are three flower market locations in Guangzhou, and connecting them one after another would probably be several miles long. These places that have become flower markets have quite a historical origin. For example, near the "Thirteen Hongs," which is very famous in modern Chinese history, at Shuangmen Di (the area of ​​the current Yonghan North Road) where the "copper clepsydra" was placed in ancient times, and in Xiguan, where wealthy families used to be concentrated, there was always a flower market. In the two or three days approaching the Spring Festival, flower racks are set up along the streets in these places, and the appearance is a bit like the stands in a circus. The racks are filled with flowers and fruit trees, making these bamboo racks become rows of "flower walls." The streets also become "flower streets" one by one. People flow back and forth through these flower streets. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the so-called Lunar New Year's Eve, the lively scene of the flower market reaches its climax. On this night, those who come to see the flowers and those who buy the flowers rub shoulders and jostle, continuing until dawn. Almost the majority of the city's people, like rural people going to the market, run to see the flowers.

　　People in the past have lamented "planting flowers for a year, watching flowers for ten days." In "Stories Old and New," ancient literati used the words of characters in novels to say: "All flowers only bloom once a year, occupying only one season out of the four seasons, and only a few days in one season. It endures the coldness of three seasons before earning these few days of glory... Moreover, within these few days, it is still in bud at first, and then withers and fades. There is even less time when it is in full bloom." These words are quite right. Precisely because of this, the flower market in Guangzhou makes people feel like stepping into a dreamlike realm, feeling particularly fascinated and amazed. Because in this flower market, there are dozens of kinds of blooming flowers displayed at the same time. Those that originally bloom in autumn are made to bloom in these two days by the flower farmers. Those that originally bloom in late spring are urged to bloom in these two days in advance by the flower farmers. The scene makes people think of the masterpiece of the "Flower God" in Chinese mythology, who makes all the flowers bloom in one night. In the flower market, there are plum blossoms with "faint fragrance and sparse shadows," peonies with "lying in a cluster, weak and drunk," peonies with "full muscles and weak bones needing a doctor," chrysanthemums with "accumulating beauty on the tip of the brush, writing in the frost," narcissus with the beautiful name of "Nymph of the Waves," peach blossoms "lightly dyed with rouge," camellias as elegant as Song paintings, hanging bell flowers shaking many small bells, "smiling" with a strange fragrance, gladiolus and colorful birds blooming from the bottom to the top, dignified jade hairpins, enchanting roses..., the variety of flowers is truly extreme. Another feature of the South China Flower Market is that many fruit trees with abundant fruits are also displayed at the same time. These are kumquats, oranges, vermilion tangerines, sapodilla fruits, and the like. A well-grown kumquat can have more than a hundred fruits on a single plant. The arrangement of flowers and plants makes people think that various flowers and plants seem to have their own personalities. Some are strong, some are weak, some are dignified, and some are coquettish. The fantasies they give people are not necessarily associated with young girls; they also remind people of other people. Small palm trees remind people of quiet and serious middle-aged people, cacti remind people of iron men who have experienced the vicissitudes of life. Gladiolus is like a female athlete, cockscomb is like a matchmaker waving a large sunflower fan and wearing a big red flower...

　　Squeezing back and forth in the flower market, the fun is difficult to describe. For festivals like the Spring Festival, an ancient and wonderful feeling seems to have been drilling into our capillaries. That atmosphere is felt by our entire nation. On the surface, the crowds are watching the flowers, but in the crowds, there always seems to be a voice ringing, which is the sound of welcoming the spring, the sound of mutual congratulations, and the sound of reciting Tang poems or maxims of the sages (such as "A year's plan lies in spring"). It evokes a strong sense of national emotion in this atmosphere. When I was young, when spring came, when people set off firecrackers and inserted plum blossoms, I had a warm feeling. In the past, I thought this was just because spring had come and the yeast of love was acting up in the blood vessels, but in fact, this is not entirely the case. That is the national life emotion evoked by the festival. In the flower market, how familiar and harmonious a person seems to be with everything around him.

　　On such days, many stalls selling antiques, selling porcelain, selling calligraphy and paintings, and selling goldfish appear at the same time. A wide variety of flowers, a wide variety of goldfish, Ge ware, Jun red, sky blue, famille rose... porcelain, all come to celebrate the festival. That is the crystallization of labor of many people in many generations, such a profound cultural accumulation! In the flower market, holding a bunch of flowers and carrying a branch of hanging bell flowers slowly walking home is the most leisurely and enjoyable thing. Seeing that everyone can do this these years is an even happier thing. In that occasion, it is easy for people to think of poetry, so I wrote these few lines:

　　"The silver night flower street is ten miles long, the city is full of men and women with fragrant temples and clothes.
　　The crowd is drunk under the lights, vying to see the spring flowers in their first makeup!"

    南国花市
    秦牧
    “春风摇荡自东来，折尽樱桃绽尽梅”。暖融融的春风一吹，大地上就到处花开了。这时节，很使人想起中国古代那些“一县花”、“芙蓉城”之类的传说。广州春节前夜的花市，比历史传说的境界还要美些。这些年我住在广州，每年一度的花市，总是非得去挤一挤流几滴汗不可。这一夜，似乎许多广州人都有佛教所说的那种“拈花微笑”的风度了。
    广州是一个终年都有花开的城市。木本中的紫荆，草本中的剑兰，我真不知道它们究竟什么时候不开花。小小的花摊平时是到处密布的，但是大规模的花市却只是一年一度。唯其是一年一度，气派可就更好看啦。地理环境使广州最先地迎接春风，在全国各个城市中最先地成为花团锦簇的城市。因为那道使人想起了温暖的北回归线就在广州北面不远穿过！记得苏联文学作品中曾经提到他们那里有一种花叫做“报春花”（和中国一些地方称为“报春花”的木兰不同），开的是一个个小铃似的花朵。俄国民间传说认为春风一吹，这些田野的小铃就摇起头来，呼唤大地道：“开花啦，开花啦，春天来了。”广东有一种特产的名花叫做“吊钟花”，每一个花蕊里面能长出十个左右的倒吊的小钟儿似的花朵来。仿佛它们也是春天的使者，敲着它们的小钟儿报告春讯，于是，鹅黄嫩绿、万紫千红都苏醒过来，倏忽间大地就披上花巾了。
    广州的花市共有三个地方，把它们前后连接起来，恐怕有几里路长。这些成为花市的地方，是很有点历史渊源的。例如在中国近代史上很著名的“十三行”附近，在古代放置“铜壶滴漏”的双门底（现在的永汉北路一带），在从前朱门大户集中区的西关，就每每有一个花市。在临近春节的三两天，这些地方沿街搭起了花架，那模样儿很有点像马戏的看台。沿架置满花卉果树，使这些竹架一列列变成了“花墙”。街道也就一条条变成了“花街”。人流就在这些花街中穿来穿去。春节的前夜，即所谓农历的除夕，花市的热闹景象达到了高潮。这一夜，看花的，买花的，摩肩接踵，一直闹到天亮。几乎全城的大多数人，像乡村人家赶集似地，都跑来看花了。
    从前的人们曾经叹惜过“种花一年，看花十日”。在“今古奇观”中，古代文人借小说里人物之口，说过这样的话：“凡花一年只开得一度，四时中只占得一时，一时中又只占得数日。它熬过了三时的冷淡，才讨得这数日的风光……况就此数日间，先犹含蕊，后复零残，盛开之时，更无多了。”这些话是说得不错的。就正因为这样，广州的花市更加使人像踏进一个梦幻的境界似地，感到格外迷恋和赞叹。因为在这个花市里，同时陈列的盛开的花总有好几十种。原来在秋天开的，花农使它延迟在这一两天开。原来在暮春开的，花农又催它提前在这一两天开。那景气，颇使人想起中国神话中的“司花使者”一夜中使群花尽开的杰作。在花市里，“幽香淡淡影疏疏”的梅花、“卧丛无力含醉妆”的牡丹、“丰肌弱骨要人医”的芍药、“毫端蕴秀临霜写”的菊花，有“凌波仙子”美号的水仙、“淡染胭脂”的桃花、古雅一如宋画的茶花、摇着许多小钟的吊钟花、香得离奇的“含笑”、从下端开花开到顶端的剑兰彩雀、端庄的玉簪、妖冶的玫瑰……，花样儿真是多极了。南国花市的另一个特色是有许多结实累累的果树同时陈列着。这就是金橘、橙子、朱砂桔、人心果之类。种得好的金橘，有一株结果在百枚以上的。花花卉卉排列得多，使人想起各种各样的花卉似乎也各有性格，它们有刚强的，有软弱的，有庄重的，也有撒娇卖俏的，它们给人的幻想不一定和少女们联系在一起，他们也使人想起其他的人们。小葵树使人想起恬静严肃的中年人，仙人掌类植物使人想起饱历风霜的铁汉。剑兰像是女体育家、鸡冠像是摇大葵扇插大红花的媒婆……。
    在花市挤来挤去，那风趣是很难形容的。对春节这一类的节日，一种古老的美妙的感觉似乎一直钻进我们的微血管里。那种气氛是我们全民族所共同感受的。表面上，人山人海在看花，而在人丛中似乎总有一个声音在响着，那是迎春的声音，互相祝贺的声音，那是背诵唐诗或者先哲格言（例如“一年之计在于春”之类）的声音。它使人在这种气氛中唤起一种强烈的民族感情。年轻时代一到春天来了、人家燃爆竹、插梅花就有一种暖融融的感觉。从前以为这不过是春天来了，爱情的酵母在血管里作怪的缘故，其实这是不尽然的。那是节日唤起的民族生活感情。在花市里，一个人对周围的一切，是显得多么的熟悉和水乳交融啊。
    在这样的日子里，同时有许多卖古董的、卖瓷器的、卖字画的、卖金鱼的摊子一齐出现了。品种纷繁的花，品种纷繁的金鱼，哥窑、均红、天青、粉彩……的瓷器，一起给人贺节来了。那是多少人在多少世代中劳动的结晶，一种多么深厚的文化积累啊！在花市里，举着一束花、肩着一枝吊钟慢慢走回家去是悠闲享福不过的事。这些年来看到大家都能够这样做，更是一种快乐的事。在那场合，人是很容易想到诗的，我就写了这么几句：
    “银夜花街十里长，满城男女鬓衣香。
    人潮灯下浑如醉，争看春穠初上妆！”
