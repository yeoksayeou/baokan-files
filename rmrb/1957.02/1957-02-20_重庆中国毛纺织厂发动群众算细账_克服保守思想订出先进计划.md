The Chongqing China Wool Textile Factory overcame right-leaning conservative thinking. Through repeated careful accounting and tapping of potential, it revised its original production increase and economization plan.

After the factory's Party committee convened a meeting to propose the direction and methods for increasing production and practicing economy, the workshops and offices began to brew and formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy. Initially, some workshop leading cadres were busy with daily production and only allowed a few functional personnel in the workshop to handle it. Some workshop leading cadres felt that there was not much "profit" to be made. Some office leading cadres were also afraid that if the economization targets were set too high, they would not be able to complete them in the future, so they always wanted to calculate less. In general, when looking for ways to economize and carefully calculate accounts, workshops generally did not pay enough attention to economization through technological improvements. Therefore, the initially formulated production increase and economization plans were generally low, with the total from all departments only being 390,000 yuan, which was about the same as the factory's cost reduction figure last year.

After the factory Party committee and administration discovered this problem, they criticized conservative thinking and emphasized that careful accounts must be repeatedly calculated to formulate advanced and realistic production increase and economization plans. The factory also organized engineering and technical personnel and management personnel to go to the workshops and groups to help carefully calculate accounts and find ways to save money from technical improvements and management. For example, the initial target set by the entire factory's main workshop, the dyeing and finishing workshop, was to save 19,000 yuan for the year, which was equivalent to half of the workshop's economization figure in the fourth quarter of last year. Later, after the workshop Party branch mobilized the workers to criticize conservative thinking and recalculate the accounts, they found many ways to save money. Technician Lü Ziliang proposed replacing imported dyes with domestic dyes, which could save 29,000 yuan a year. Originally, a car could wash and dye four pieces of tweed and serge, but after mass discussion, it could be increased to five pieces. As a result of the workshop's recalculation of accounts, the economization target increased to 118,000 yuan.

When the factory Party committee and administration mobilized the masses to recalculate accounts, they also paid attention to correcting rash advances and unreliable aspects. For example, during the account calculation process, the dyeing and finishing workshop once planned to control the unit weight of products below the tolerance specified by the central government (which would still meet quality standards), which could save an additional 30,000 yuan a year. After listening to the report from the workshop branch secretary, the Party committee believed that this approach might affect product quality and corrected their approach. In addition, the administrative department also established a special review team to conduct detailed calculations for each production increase and economization plan formulated by the workshops and offices, and eliminated unrealistic or duplicated parts. Finally, they formulated a more realistic production increase and economization plan for the entire factory, with the factory planning to increase production and save 680,000 yuan this year.

### 重庆中国毛纺织厂发动群众算细账  克服保守思想订出先进计划

    重庆中国毛纺织厂发动群众算细账
    克服保守思想订出先进计划
    本报讯　重庆中国毛纺织厂克服右倾保守思想，通过反复算细账、挖潜力，修订了原来的增产节约计划。
    当厂里党委开会提出增产节约的方向和途径以后，各车间科室就开始酝酿制定增产节约计划。最初，有的车间领导干部忙于日常生产，只让车间少数职能人员去搞，有的车间领导干部认为“油水”不大；有的科室领导干部也怕节约指标订高了，将来完不成，总想少算点。一般的车间在寻找节约门路、算细账的时候，普遍对技术改进这方面的节约注意不够。因此，最初制定的增产节约计划一般偏低，各部门汇总只有三十九万元，和去年全厂降低成本的数字差不多。
    厂里党委和行政发现这个问题后，批判了保守思想，强调必须反复算细账，订出先进而又切合实际的增产节约计划。厂里还组织工程技术人员和管理人员下车间和小组帮助算细账，从技术改进和管理方面寻找节约办法。例如全厂的主要车间之一——整染车间最初订出的指标，是全年节约一万九千元，相当于这个车间去年第四季度节约数字的一半。后来，经车间党支部发动职工批判了保守思想重新算细账，就找出了许多节约的办法。车间技术员吕子良提出用国产染料代替进口染料的建议，一年可以节约二万九千元。原来一部车子洗染花呢、哔叽四匹，经群众讨论，可以增加到五匹。这个车间重新算细账的结果，节约指标增加到十一万八千元。
    厂里党委和行政在发动群众重新算细账的时候，也注意到纠正冒进情绪和不可靠的地方。例如整染车间在算细账当中，曾经打算把产品的单位持重掌握在中央规定的公差以下（这样仍然合乎质量标准），一年就可以多节约三万元。党委在听取车间支部书记的汇报以后，认为这种作法可能影响到产品质量，便纠正了他们这种作法。此外，行政部门又专门成立了审查小组，对各车间科室制定的增产节约计划，逐项进行了详细的核算，剔除了其中不切实际或者重复的部分。最后，他们才制定出全厂比较切合实际的增产节约计划，全厂今年计划增产节约六十八万元。
