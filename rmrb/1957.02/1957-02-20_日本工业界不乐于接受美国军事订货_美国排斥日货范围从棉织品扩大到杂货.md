    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th: According to Kyodo News Agency, Japanese industrial circles are not very willing to accept special procurement orders of a military nature from the United States (“special demand” orders).

    Due to the rapid increase in orders from abroad and domestic demand, especially for coal, steel, machinery, and non-ferrous metal products, Japanese industrial circles have no choice but to abandon the US procurement orders that they have always relied upon in the past, now in short supply.

    Although the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has called on industrial circles to do their utmost to accept US procurement orders, industrial circles still favor conducting domestic and foreign trade, and are reluctant to accept US procurement orders. The reasons are: special procurement orders are not permanent, and US troops may suddenly terminate orders at any time; the prices of such orders are always kept very low, and a strict acceptance system is implemented for the supplied goods; the nature of such orders cannot establish business relationships for future transactions.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 19th: According to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," the movement in the United States to reject Japanese goods has expanded from cotton textiles to general merchandise.

    Most of Japan's general merchandise merchants are small and medium-sized enterprises. On average, their products exported to the United States account for more than 50% of their total exports. The US rejection of Japanese general merchandise will deal a fatal blow to these small and medium-sized enterprises. According to reports, Japanese watch strap merchants and other related enterprises have launched a movement to oppose the US rejection of Japanese goods.

    日本工业界不乐于接受美国军事订货
    美国排斥日货范围从棉织品扩大到杂货
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：据共同社报道，日本工业界不太愿意接受美国的军事性的特别采购订货（“特需”订货）。
    日本工业界由于来自国外的订货和国内的需求都在急剧增加，尤其是煤、钢铁、机器和有色金属的产品供不应求，使他们不得不放弃过去所一向依赖的美国采购订货。
    通商产业省虽然已经号召工业界要竭尽全力来接受美国的采购订货，但是工业界仍然赞成进行国内外贸易，而不乐于接受美国的采购订货。原因是：特别采购订货不是永久性的，美国驻军可能任何时候突然中止订货；这种订货的价格一向被压得很低，而且对供应的货物实行一套严格的验收制度；这种订货的性质本身不能为今后的交易建立买卖关系。
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：据“日本经济新闻”报道，美国排斥日本货的运动，已经从棉织品扩大到一般杂货。
    日本的杂货商大多是中小企业。它们的产品对美国的输出平均都占全部输出额的50％以上。美国对日本杂货的排斥，将给这些中小企业以致命打击。据报道，日本的表带商等有关企业已经发起反对美国排斥日本货的运动。
