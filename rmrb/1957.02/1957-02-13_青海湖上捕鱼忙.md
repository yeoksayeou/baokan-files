Xinhua News Agency, Xining Electric Dispatch. On Qinghai Lake, fishermen are still braving the severe cold to break the ice and catch the famous Huang fish of the lake. Every morning, groups of fishermen, draped in sheepskin coats, carrying fishing rods and wooden fish boxes, set out from their lakeside tents and walk towards the frozen lake surface against the biting cold wind. On the lake, each fisherman chisels two holes in the ice, holding a fishing rod in each hand, and lowers the fishing line into the holes, waiting for the fish to bite. After the Huang fish are caught, they are placed on the ice to freeze. This is the frozen fish that appears in markets in Qinghai Province, as well as Lanzhou, Yumen, and Wuwei in Gansu Province, and Xi'an in Shaanxi Province.

This fishing season, from last winter to this spring, has seen a bumper harvest of frozen fish, with an estimated catch of more than one million jin, exceeding the highest annual output in history.

    青海湖上捕鱼忙
    据新华社西宁电　青海湖上，渔民仍在冒着严寒破冰捕捉湖中著名的湟鱼。每天早晨，成群结队的渔民披着羊皮袄，拿着钓竿和装鱼木箱，从湖滨的帐篷中出发，迎着刺骨的寒风向结冰的湖面上走去。在湖面上，每个渔民都在冰上凿开两个洞，每只手各执一根钓竿，把钓线垂入洞内，等待游鱼上钩。把湟鱼钓上之后，便放在冰上让它冰冻。这就是在青海省内和甘肃省兰州、玉门、武威以及陕西省西安等地的市场上出现的冰鱼。
    去冬和今春的这个捕鱼季节，冰鱼大丰收，估计可捕捉一百多万斤，超过历史上最高的年产量。
