    Academy of Sciences Fourth Quaternary Academic Conference Opens
    Institute of Botany Academic Committee Established

    Xinhua News Agency - The Quaternary Research Committee, composed of twenty scholars and experts, announced its establishment at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Fourth Quaternary Academic Conference, which opened on the 11th. Li Siguang, Hou Defeng, and Yang Zhongjian were appointed as Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the committee, respectively.

    The Quaternary is the most recent period in the Earth's crustal development, and it was during this period that humans appeared on Earth. Geological processes during the Quaternary period have had a significant impact on humanity. Quaternary strata form the foundation for various civil and industrial constructions. The major river basin development projects, water conservancy and irrigation projects, and soil and water conservation efforts in the vast loess regions currently underway or about to begin in our country are all being carried out on Quaternary strata. Conducting research on the Quaternary is of great significance to economic construction.

    At the meeting on the 11th, Hou Defeng discussed the current state of Quaternary science development in China: After 1929, Chinese scholars conducted relatively extensive investigations and research on Quaternary strata, human fossils, and other animal fossils, and achieved some successes. In recent years, research in various aspects of the Quaternary, such as paleoanthropology, paleozoology, paleobotany, archaeology, and loess research, has seen new development based on existing foundations. Scholars have collected a great deal of information on Quaternary strata and landforms, and have conducted studies on Quaternary geology and landforms to varying degrees in mineral distribution areas, petroleum prospecting and exploration areas, water conservancy project construction areas, agricultural construction areas, and urban and industrial construction areas. In particular, specialized mapping and surveying of Quaternary landforms has begun, marking a new direction in the development of Quaternary science in China.

    More than eighty academic papers on Quaternary geology and landforms were presented at this academic conference. More than 160 experts in geology, landforms, and paleontology attended the conference, which will conclude on the 15th.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 11th - The Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Botany held its Academic Committee founding meeting in Beijing today.

    Qian Chongshu, Director of the Institute, introduced the institute's recent work achievements and discussed future work plans at the meeting. This comprehensive botanical research institute was established in 1953. Currently, it has five research groups: Higher Plant Taxonomy and Geography Group, Plant Ecology and Geobotany Group, Plant Morphology, Anatomy and Cytology Group, Botanical Garden Group, and Plant Resources Group.

    Over the past few years, the Higher Plant Taxonomy and Geography Group has accumulated a great deal of data in the study of the types and distribution of plants in China. Scientists have also participated in the investigation of plant resources and regional development. This group has collaborated with other units to publish the "Key to Families and Genera of Chinese Plants," etc., and has published several manuals on economic plants. The scientists of the Plant Ecology and Geobotany Group have cooperated with river basin planning, wasteland utilization, and soil and water conservation efforts, and have conducted multiple investigations and studies of vegetation and plant ecology in various regions of northern and southern China. The Plant Resources Group was established recently and mainly studies plant anatomy. The Plant Morphology, Anatomy and Cytology Group has conducted research on pollen morphology, seed plant embryology, and cytology. This research can help solve some problems in the evolution of seed plants and can also provide valuable material for identifying the age of strata, which is of great significance to geological exploration. The institute's various professional groups have also participated in the investigation and research work of various comprehensive expedition teams.

    When discussing future work plans, Qian Chongshu said: The preparatory work for a large-scale "General Herbarium" is about to begin. This museum will collect plant data from all over the world and will be the national research center for plant taxonomy.

    At the meeting, Qian Chongshu, on behalf of Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, presented a certificate of merit to the scientist Zhong Buqiu, rewarding him for donating over 5,000 books and over 5,000 specimens related to plants, which were the lifelong collection of his father, Professor Zhong Guangguang, to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    科学院第四纪学术会议开幕
    植物研究所学术委员会成立
    据新华社讯　由二十个学者、专家组成的第四纪研究委员会，在11日开幕的中国科学院第四纪学术会议上宣布成立。李四光、侯德封、杨钟健分别担任这个委员会的主席、副主席。
    第四纪是地壳发展历史的最新时期，到这个时期人类才在地球上出现。第四纪时期的地质作用，对人类影响很大。第四纪地层是各种民用建设、工业建设等的基础。我国正在进行的或即将进行的各大流域的开发工作、水利灌溉工程和广大黄土区域的水土保持工作，都是在第四纪地层上进行的。开展第四纪的研究，对经济建设具有重大的意义。
    侯德封在11日的会上谈到我国第四纪科学的发展现状：在1929年后，我国学者对第四纪地层、人类化石和其他动物化石进行了比较广泛的调查研究，并获得一些成就。近几年来，第四纪各方面的研究工作如古人类学、古动物学、古植物学、考古学及黄土研究等，都在已有基础上有了新的开展。学者们收集了很多关于第四纪地层和地貌的资料，在矿产分布地区、石油普查勘探地区、水利工程建设地区、农业建设地区以及城市建设和工矿建设等地区，在不同程度上作了第四纪地质和地貌的研究，特别是开始了专门性的对第四纪的地貌测量和制图，它标志着我国第四纪科学发展的新方向。
    在这次学术会议上提出的有关第四纪地质、地貌的学术论文共八十多篇。参加会议的有地质、地貌和古生物等方面的专家共一百六十多人，会议将在15日结束。
    据新华社11日讯　中国科学院植物研究所今天在北京举行学术委员会成立大会。
    研究所所长钱崇澍在会上介绍了研究所近年来的工作成就并谈到今后的工作。这个综合性的植物研究所是在1953年成立的。现在，它有高等植物分类及地理组、植物生态及地植物学组、植物形态解剖及细胞组、植物园组、植物资源组等五个研究组。
    几年来，高等植物分类及地理组在中国植物的种类和分布的研究方面积累了很多资料。科学家们还参加了植物资源、区域开发的调查工作。这个组同其他单位合作，出版了“中国植物的科属检索表”等，并刊印了几种关于经济植物的手册。植物生态及地植物学组的科学工作者配合流域规划、荒地利用、水土保持等工作，在我国南北各地区，进行了多次植被和植物生态的调查研究。植物资源组成立不久，主要研究植物解剖方面的问题。植物形态解剖及细胞组进行了花粉形态和种子植物胚胎以及细胞学的研究，这一研究可以帮助解决种子植物进化中的一些问题，同时也能为鉴定地层年代提供有价值的材料，对地质勘探有着很大意义。研究所的各个专业组还参加过各种综合考察队的调查研究工作。
    在谈到今后的工作规划时，钱崇澍说：一个规模巨大的“总植物标本馆”的筹建工作即将开始。这个馆将搜藏世界各地区植物资料，它将是全国性的植物分类学的研究中心。
    钱崇澍在会上代表中国科学院院长郭沫若把奖状赠给科学家钟补求，奖励他把他父亲钟观光教授毕生收藏的有关植物的图书五千多册以及五千多件标本赠给中国科学院。
