    埃及检察长对英国间谍起诉
    新华社开罗8日电　据中东通讯社报道，埃及检察长7日正式提出起诉书，控告二十名为英国服务的间谍，其中包括前阿拉伯通讯社社长、英国人詹姆士·斯温布恩。
    起诉书说，这些被告“进行间谍活动，以取得被认为是国防机密的有关武装部队、它们的调动和装备以及军事行动的资料、情报和文件”。
    起诉书指出：“进行这种活动的目的，是要把这些机密传递给一个外国——英国，并且已经把这种情报交给英国和其他为英国服务的人。”起诉书还说，所有这些被控告的人每月从英国领薪水。
    起诉书要求把所有被控告的间谍判处死刑。
    在起诉书提到的二十个人中，有四个是英国人，十六个是埃及人。斯温布恩是这个间谍网的头子。他所办的阿拉伯通讯社驻开罗办事处已经在今年1月1日被埃及当局下令取消。
    埃及法院将在2月14日审理这个案件。
