Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 18th. Experiments conducted by the Apiculture Professional Committee of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in various parts of the Soviet Union over the past few years have proven that bee pollination plays a significant role in increasing the yield and quality of crops such as buckwheat, sunflowers, cotton, sugar beets, flax, melons, and fruits.

According to a recently published report by apiculture experts, a single bee flying over a field of buckwheat can visit five hundred flowers, transferring between five hundred thousand and five million pollen grains at the same time. Experiments conducted in the Kazakh Republic and the North Caucasus have shown that using bee pollination can increase sunflower yields by 25% to 30%, and in some cases even by 50%. State farms in northern regions have used bees to spread pollen in greenhouses, increasing cucumber yields threefold or fourfold. Bee pollination not only increases yields, but it also improves the quality of flax and increases the sugar content of sugar beets.

Experiments in Azerbaijan are of great interest. A colony of bees can collect 800 grams to 2 kilograms of nectar from cotton pollen in a single day, while also bringing many benefits to the cotton: the phenomenon of cotton boll abscission is reduced; the weight of the cotton bolls increases, and cotton seeds are thus improved. Cotton seeds that have been pollinated by bees germinate three to seven days earlier than ordinary cotton seeds and grow vigorously.

    苏联农学家实验证明
    蜜蜂授粉可提高农作物产量
    新华社莫斯科18日电　全苏列宁农业科学院养蜂专业委员会几年以来在苏联各地进行的实验证明，蜜蜂授粉对提高蓼属植物、向日葵、棉花、甜菜、亚麻、瓜果等农作物的产量和质量有重大作用。
    根据最近发表的养蜂专家的报告，一只蜜蜂到种植蓼属植物的田野上飞行一次，就可以在五百个花朵上停留，同时传递五十万到五百万颗花粉。在哈萨克共和国和北高加索进行的实验证明，用蜜蜂授粉的方法，可使向日葵的产量提高25％到30％，在个别情形下甚至可以提高50％。在北方地区的国营农场利用蜜蜂在温室里传播花粉的方法，使黄瓜产量提高了三、四倍。蜜蜂授粉不但可以提高收获量，它还可以提高亚麻的质量和提高甜菜的含糖量。
    在阿塞拜疆所作的实验是饶有兴趣的，一族蜜蜂在一天内可以从棉花花粉中采集八百克到二公斤的蜜，同时又给棉花带来很多好处：棉桃雕落现象减少了；棉桃重量增加，棉花种子也因而改良。经过蜜蜂授粉的棉花的种子，要比普通棉籽早发芽三天到七天，并且生长茂盛。
