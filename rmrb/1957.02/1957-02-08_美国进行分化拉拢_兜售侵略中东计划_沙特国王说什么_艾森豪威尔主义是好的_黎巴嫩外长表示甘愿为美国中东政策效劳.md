Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: Washington authorities have been conducting intense activities in the past few days with certain Arab leaders in an effort to win them over to help promote the United States' new Middle East policy.

After US President Eisenhower held successive talks with the King of Saudi Arabia and the Crown Prince of Iraq, he held talks with a third Arab leader, Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik, on the Eisenhower Plan on the 6th.

In the past few days, diplomatic officials from Arab countries in Washington have also been in frequent contact. On the 6th, Egyptian Ambassador to the United States Ahmed Hussein and Jordanian Ambassador to the United States Abdul Monem Rifai visited Saudi King Saud and held talks with him.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: Saudi Arabian King Saud said at a press conference on the 6th that his talks with Eisenhower were "very satisfactory." He obtained a clearer understanding of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" from Eisenhower, and he will tell other Arab leaders about his understanding.

Saud said that "the Eisenhower Doctrine is good" and "it deserves (the Arab people's) consideration and attention." However, he declined to say whether he would try to get other Arab countries to support the "doctrine" after he returned to the Middle East.

Saud said he hoped the United States would help Saudi Arabia expand the number of troops and hoped to receive more "military assistance" from the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik said after meeting with Eisenhower on the 6th that he intends to try to get Arab countries to support Eisenhower's Middle East plan. He has already made this guarantee to Eisenhower.

Malik said that Lebanon currently receives military assistance from the United States, but "this is negligible, and we hope to get more assistance."

    美国进行分化拉拢　兜售侵略中东计划
    沙特国王说什么“艾森豪威尔主义是好的”  黎巴嫩外长表示甘愿为美国中东政策效劳
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：华盛顿当局这几天正在对某些阿拉伯国家领袖进行紧张的活动，以争取他们来帮助推行美国的新中东政策。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔接连同沙特阿拉伯国王、伊拉克王储会谈以后，6日又同第三个阿拉伯国家领袖、黎巴嫩外交部长马利克就艾森豪威尔计划举行会谈。
    这几天里，在华盛顿的阿拉伯国家的外交官员们也在进行着频繁的接触。6日，埃及驻美大使艾哈迈德·侯赛尼和约旦驻美大使阿卜杜勒·莫奈姆·里法伊访问了沙特阿拉伯国王沙特，同他进行了会谈。
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：沙特阿拉伯国王沙特6日在记者招待会上说，他同艾森豪威尔的会谈进行得“十分令人满意”。他从艾森豪威尔那儿得到了关于“艾森豪威尔主义”的更清楚的理解，他将把他理解的情况告诉其他阿拉伯领袖们。
    沙特说“艾森豪威尔主义是好的”，“它理应受到（阿拉伯人民的）考虑和重视”。但是他拒绝说明在他返回中东以后是否将设法使其他阿拉伯国家支持这个“主义”。
    沙特说，他希望美国帮助沙特阿拉伯扩大军队的数目，并且希望从美国得到更多的“军事援助”。
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：黎巴嫩外交部长马利克6日在同艾森豪威尔会谈后说，他打算设法使阿拉伯国家支持艾森豪威尔的中东计划。他已经对艾森豪威尔提出了这个保证。
    马利克说，黎巴嫩目前从美国得到军事援助，但是“这是不足道的，我们希望得到更多的援助”。
