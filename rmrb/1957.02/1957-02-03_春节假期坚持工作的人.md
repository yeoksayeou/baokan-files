To Those Working During the Spring Festival Holiday
                      By Yuan Shuipai
    The New Year's Eve fire glows red against the window curtains,
    In the mine shaft, the wind drill spins rapidly,
    Smiling faces are streaked with black sweat,
    We work happily during the festival for everyone's holiday.
    Firecrackers pop in the village, one burst after another,
    In the distant port, the docks are brightly lit,
    Towering cranes transport fertilizer,
    We work during the festival for the farmers' holiday.
    The cold wind bites, and heavy snow seals the roads,
    Postmen and purchasing agents are still busy during the holiday,
    Doctors and nurses are on duty during the holiday,
    Steelworkers haven't gone home, guarding the blast furnace...
    Not letting a minute be wasted,
    Accumulating construction materials for the country.
    We are builders of socialism,
    Creating future holidays for hundreds of millions of people. (Attached picture)

    Happy Spring Festival

    Over ten thousand miners in the Jingxi Mining Area contributed their two-day holiday during the Spring Festival to increase coal production in the mines. The first shift of workers at the Chengzi Coal Mine mined more than 453 tons of coal during the Spring Festival holiday, exceeding the state's holiday production increase target by more than 80%. The picture shows miners digging coal at the Chengzi Coal Mine in the Jingxi Mining Area.

    The chefs in the Chengzi Coal Mine canteen in the Jingxi Mining Area did not rest during the Spring Festival holiday either. In order to ensure that employees eat well and work better, they carefully prepared a variety of delicious foods.

    This is a corner of the children's toy department of the Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing, where salespersons are helping customers choose their children's favorite toys. During the Spring Festival, the streets must be kept clean. These two sanitation workers are cleaning Dongchang'an Street in Beijing.

    Many people always want to take a picture in front of Tiananmen Square with lanterns and flags, so the photographers at the photography service are even busier.

    The operators in the domestic service room of the Beijing Telegraph Bureau are receiving and sending telegrams.

    Thank you, Comrade Driver, you've worked hard.

    During the holiday, there are more vehicles and pedestrians in Dongdan, Beijing, and the traffic police there hardly have a minute to rest.

    During the Spring Festival, the work of Beijing actors is very intense. This is a scene from the historical drama "Tiger Tally" performed at the Capital Theater.

    The actors performed many wonderful programs during the holiday, earning warm applause from the audience. All photos on this page are taken by reporters from this newspaper.

    Nurses in the obstetrics department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing are working as usual during the Spring Festival holiday.

    致春节假日工作的人

    除夕的炉火映红了窗帘，
    矿坑里风镐飞快地旋转，
    微笑的脸上淌下黑色的汗水，
    为了大家的节日我们在节日干得欢。
    村子里爆竹声一阵又一阵，
    远方港口的码头上灯火通明，
    隆隆的吊车运送着肥田粉，
    为了农民的节日我们在节日也出勤。
    寒风刺骨，大雪封路，
    邮递员、采购员节日还在奔忙，
    医生和护士假期也值班，
    炼铁工人没有回乡，守着高炉……
    一分钟也不让它白白丧失，
    要为国家累积建设的物资。
    我们是社会主义的建设者，
    为千百万人创造未来的节日。（附图片）
    春节好
