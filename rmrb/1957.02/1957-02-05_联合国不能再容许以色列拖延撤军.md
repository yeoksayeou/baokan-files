The United Nations Must No Longer Allow Israel to Delay Withdrawal

On February 1st and 2nd, the United Nations General Assembly plenary session discussed the issue of the withdrawal of Israeli invading forces from Egyptian territory, and passed two proposals regarding the demand for Israeli withdrawal. One was for Israel to immediately withdraw its troops to behind the 1949 Egyptian-Israeli armistice line; the other advocated for the stationing of United Nations forces on the Egyptian-Israeli armistice line after the Israeli withdrawal, and for the United Nations forces to enter the Gulf of Aqaba.

Since the United Nations General Assembly decided on November 2nd of last year to demand Israel's withdrawal, this is the seventh time it has passed resolutions of the same nature. The Israeli government has repeatedly defied and refused to implement the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations General Assembly should take effective measures to force Israel to implement the resolutions in order to maintain the dignity of the United Nations and peace in the Middle East. However, this time, the United Nations General Assembly not only failed to condemn Israel's refusal to implement the resolutions and take decisive measures, but also, in the second proposal it passed, actually satisfied Israel's unreasonable "condition" of demanding that United Nations forces occupy the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip after its invading forces withdrew from Egypt.

At the United Nations General Assembly, although the Indian representative made a correct interpretation of the second proposal, the interpretation of the American representative was to allow the United Nations forces to occupy Egyptian territory indefinitely. From the discussions at this United Nations General Assembly, it has become increasingly clear that the reason Israel refuses to implement the United Nations resolutions and delays its withdrawal from Egypt is a joint scheme by the three Western colonial powers of the United States, Britain, and France. French Foreign Minister Pineau and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd had long clamored for the Gaza Strip to be handed over to the United Nations for "administration." This time at the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. Representative Lodge insisted on having United Nations forces stationed on both sides of the Egyptian-Israeli armistice line, advocating that United Nations forces must be stationed in the Gaza Strip and the Tiran Island area. U.S. news agencies even revealed as early as January 17th that the United States, Britain, and France had agreed that United Nations forces would occupy the Straits of Tiran and the Gaza Strip and "oppose any attempt by Asian and African countries to impose sanctions on Israel." This clearly exposes the true inside story of this farce recently performed by the Western colonial powers and Israel.

The Washington ruling clique's active encouragement of Israel to delay its withdrawal is also inseparable from its overall aggressive plan of promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East. As the Damascus "Al-Alam" pointed out: "The United States is trying to use the issue of withdrawing Israeli troops to bargain with the Arab people, forcing them to agree to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine."

The immediate and complete withdrawal of Israeli invading forces to behind the 1949 armistice line is the primary issue currently facing the restoration of peace in the Middle East. Israel destroyed the Egyptian-Israeli armistice agreement, invaded Egypt, and endangered peace in the Middle East, and should have been severely sanctioned; now, there can be no "conditions" whatsoever for its withdrawal. If Israel is allowed to propose conditions that are detrimental to Egyptian sovereignty, it would be encouraging aggression. This is neither in line with the interests of world peace nor with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly should, in accordance with previous resolutions on the issue of Israeli withdrawal, take effective steps to order Israel to immediately withdraw its troops to behind the 1949 armistice line.

As for who should "manage" these Egyptian territories after the withdrawal of Israeli invading forces, it is not an issue at all. Whether it is Gaza, the Gulf of Aqaba, or the Tiran Straits area, after the Israeli withdrawal, Egypt should be able to restore the exercise of its sovereignty in these places without any interference. United Nations forces have the right to supervise the withdrawal of invading forces, but have no right whatsoever to occupy an inch of Egyptian territory in place of the British, French, and Israeli invading forces. According to the terms of the agreement between Egypt and the United Nations regarding the entry of United Nations armed forces into Egyptian territory, United Nations forces cannot carry out occupation tasks. Not long ago, Indian Prime Minister Nehru said: "The Indian government, along with the governments of Burma, Ceylon, and Indonesia, believes that the United Nations Emergency Force in Egypt should be a temporary force"; "According to the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the task of the United Nations Emergency Force is to ensure and supervise the cessation of hostilities." Indian Representative to the United Nations Menon also said: "India will never support the proposition of turning the United Nations Emergency Force into an occupation force." Therefore, the attempt by Western colonial powers to use United Nations forces to occupy Egyptian territory for a long time and exert pressure on Egypt will be resolutely opposed by all peace-loving and just countries and peoples.

### 联合国不能再容许以色列拖延撤军

    联合国不能再容许以色列拖延撤军
    2月1日和2日，联合国大会全体会议讨论了以色列侵略军撤出埃及领土的问题，并且通过了关于要求以色列撤军的两项提案。一项是要以色列马上把它的军队撤退到1949年以埃停战线的后面去；一项主张在以色列撤军之后，要在以埃之间的停战分界线上驻扎联合国部队，并把联合国部队开进亚喀巴湾。
    联合国大会自去年11月2日决定要以色列撤军以来，这是第七次通过相同性质的决议了。以色列政府一再藐视和拒不执行联合国大会的决议，联合国大会是应该采取有效措施，强迫以色列执行决议，以维护联合国尊严和中东和平的。可是，这次联合国大会不仅没有对以色列拒不执行决议进行谴责和采取决定性的措施，并且在它所通过的第二项提案中，实际上满足了以色列要求在它的侵略军从埃及撤退之后，由联合国部队占领亚喀巴湾和加沙地区的无理“条件”。
    在联合国大会上，印度代表虽然对第二项提案作了正确的解释，可是美国代表的解释却是要让联合国部队无限期地占领埃及领土。从这次联合国大会的讨论中，越来越清楚地证明以色列之所以拒不执行联合国决议，拖延从埃及撤军，乃是美英法三个西方殖民国家共同策划的。法国外长比诺和英国外交大臣劳埃德早就叫嚷要把加沙地带交由联合国“管理”。美国驻联合国代表洛奇这次在联合国大会上坚持要让联合国部队驻扎以埃停战线的两边，主张联合国部队必须进驻加沙地区和蒂朗岛地区。美国通讯社甚至早在1月17日就透露，美英法三国已经协议由联合国部队占领蒂朗海峡和加沙地带，并“反对亚非国家对以色列实施任何制裁的企图”。这都清楚地暴露了西方殖民国家和以色列最近所演唱的这一出双簧戏的真实内幕。
    华盛顿统治集团积极怂恿以色列拖延撤军，也是同它在中东推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的总的侵略计划不可分的。正如大马士革“旗帜报”所指出：“美国企图利用撤退以色列军队的问题同阿拉伯人民讨价还价，强迫他们同意接受艾森豪威尔主义。”
    以色列侵略军队应该立即全部撤退到1949年停战线后面去，这是目前恢复中东和平所面临的首要问题。以色列破坏了以埃停战协定，侵略了埃及，危害了中东的和平，本来应当受到严厉的制裁；现在要它撤出侵略军是根本不能有什么“条件”的。如果允许以色列提出有损埃及主权的条件来，那就是鼓励侵略。这既不符合于世界和平的利益，也不符合于联合国宪章的宗旨。因此，联合国大会应根据历次关于以色列撤军问题的决议，采取有效的步骤，勒令以色列把军队立即撤退到1949年停战线的后面去。
    至于以色列侵略军撤出之后，这些埃及领土应该由谁来“管理”，根本不成为问题。无论是加沙、亚喀巴湾或蒂朗海峡地区，在以色列撤军以后，埃及就能够在这些地方恢复行使其主权，而不应该受到任何干涉。联合国部队有权监督侵略军队的撤退，而根本无权代替英法以侵略军侵占埃及的一寸土地。根据埃及和联合国关于联合国武装部队进入埃及领土的协议的条件，联合国部队是不能执行占领任务的。不久前，印度总理尼赫鲁就曾说过：“印度政府同缅甸、锡兰和印度尼西亚的政府都认为在埃及的联合国紧急部队应该是一支暂时性的部队”；“按照联合国大会的决议，联合国紧急部队的任务是保证和监督敌对行动的停止”。印度驻联合国代表梅农也说：“印度决不会支持使联合国紧急部队成为一支占领军的主张。”因此，西方殖民国家企图利用联合国部队长期占领埃及领土而对埃及施加压力的作法，必将遭到一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民的坚决反对。（附图片）
