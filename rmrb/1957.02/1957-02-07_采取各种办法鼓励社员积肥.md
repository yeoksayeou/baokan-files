    Adopt Various Methods to Encourage Commune Members to Accumulate Fertilizer

    The Tie嶺 area of Liaoning Province currently has only half the amount of manure needed for this year. Most agricultural cooperatives in the Jinzhou area also lack manure. In Tai'an County, the amount of black soil collected at this time last year was enough for 30,000 *qing* of land, but this year it's only enough for 3,000 *qing*. Why is the enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer now less than before? *Liaoning Daily* published an editorial on January 29th, stating that, in addition to the leadership not paying close attention and neglecting the work of accumulating fertilizer year-round, the fundamental reason is the failure to stimulate the enthusiasm of commune members to accumulate fertilizer in all aspects.

    First, because many agricultural cooperatives' production plans were too ambitious last year, the output targets were set too high, the system of contracting work and output became a formality, and the system of rewarding over-production was not fully implemented, this weakened the sense of responsibility of commune members to guarantee output and their interest in over-production, affecting their enthusiasm for accumulating manure. Therefore, this year, we should conscientiously implement the system of contracting work and output and rewarding over-production based on setting achievable output targets. This is a good way to combine the collective interests of the cooperative with the individual interests of the commune members. It gives the commune members a clear goal to strive for over-production, which can greatly stimulate their enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer.

    Secondly, the phenomenon of excessively low manure prices, where manure collectors make little or no profit, must be changed. After collectivization, some cooperative cadres one-sidedly believed that low manure prices could reduce production costs, so they lowered the manure prices. Lowering manure prices seems to reduce production costs on the surface, but this reduction is false. In reality, it reduces the labor remuneration due to the manure-collecting commune members, only benefiting those who do not collect manure, which is tantamount to encouraging not collecting manure. The correct way to reduce production costs is to tighten unnecessary expenditures, reduce waste of labor, improve labor efficiency and work quality, and strive to increase the yield per unit area. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in various regions should conscientiously correct the deviation of unreasonable remuneration for accumulating fertilizer and excessively low manure prices, and formulate reasonable manure prices through democratic discussions by commune members. In addition to pricing pen manure based on quality, keeping clear accounts, and making regular payments, a portion of the cash income from sideline occupations should be used to purchase scattered manure collected by commune members. Purchases should also be priced according to the quality of the manure, with different grades and prices. Facts have proven that as long as the manure price is reasonable, commune members are willing to participate in manure accumulation labor.

    The editorial said that the fertilizer accumulation movement should also be closely integrated with the development of pig production, because raising more pigs is the best way to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer. One pig can accumulate enough manure for five *mu* of land per year. If each commune member household raises two pigs, it can not only overfulfill the Liaoning Province's task of developing 5.5 million pigs, but also accumulate enough fertilizer for 2.75 million *qing* of land. In the past, the price of pig manure was too low, which affected the enthusiasm of commune members to raise pigs. This deviation should also be corrected. The editorial said that we must use the three months before spring plowing to vigorously solve the problem of insufficient manure, so that the fertilized area and the amount of fertilizer applied are at least not lower than last year, creating good conditions for completing this year's increased production tasks and striving for a bumper harvest every year in the future.

### 采取各种办法鼓励社员积肥

    采取各种办法鼓励社员积肥
    辽宁省铁岭地区现有粪肥比今年需要的还差一半。锦州专区大部分农业社也缺粪肥。台安县去年这时候起的黑土够上三万垧地，今年起的只能上三千垧地。为什么现在积肥的劲头反而不如从前了呢？辽宁日报在1月29日发表社论说，除了领导上抓的不紧，忽视了常年积肥的工作以外，根本原因是没有从各方面来刺激社员积肥的积极性。
    首先，由于去年许多农业社生产计划偏大，产量定得过高，包工包产制度流于形式，超产奖励制度没有完全实现，这就减弱了社员保证产量的责任心和超产的兴趣，影响了社员们攒粪的积极性，因此，今年应当在制定确实能够达到的产量指标的基础上，认真贯彻包工包产和超产奖励制度，这是把合作社的集体利益和社员个人利益结合起来的好办法，它使社员们有一个为超产而奋斗的明确目标，可以大大地激发社员积肥的积极性。
    其次是粪价过低，攒粪者无利可图或利益微薄的现象必须改变。合作化后，有些社干部片面地认为粪价低可以降低生产成本，于是就压低粪价。压低粪价从形式上看是降低了生产成本，但这种降低是虚假的，实际上是减少了攒粪社员应得的劳动报酬，只能使不攒粪的人得到好处，等于鼓励不攒粪。降低生产成本的正确方法是紧缩不必要的开支，减少劳动力的浪费，提高劳动效率和作业质量，努力提高单位面积产量。因此，各地农业社应该认真纠正积肥报酬不合理、粪价过低的偏向，由社员民主讨论，订出合理的粪价。除圈肥可以按质论价、记清账目、定期付款外，目前还应从副业收入中拿出一部分现款，收买社员们拣的散粪。收买时也应按粪肥好坏，分级定价。事实证明，只要粪价合理，社员们是愿意参加积肥劳动的。
    社论说，积肥运动还应和发展生猪生产紧密结合，因为多养猪是大量积肥的最好办法。一口猪一年可攒五亩地的粪，如果每户社员养两头猪，不仅可以超额完成辽宁省发展生猪五百五十万头的任务，而且可以积攒二百七十五万垧地的粪肥。过去猪肥作价偏低，影响了社员们养猪的积极性，这种偏向也应该纠正。社论说，我们要利用春耕前这三个多月的时间，大力解决粪肥不足的问题，使施肥面积和施肥量至少不次于去年，为完成今年的增产任务创造良好条件，争取今后年年丰收。
