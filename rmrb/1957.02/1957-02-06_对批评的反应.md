    Response to Criticism
    The People's Daily published an article titled "Serious Waste" by Comrade Bao Zengyuan in the reader's letter section on page 7 on December 6, 1956. This article criticized the original Jiangsu Province No. 1 Rehabilitation Hospital for the mismanagement of buildings after its closure, resulting in damage to internal equipment. It was hoped that relevant departments would investigate this damage and waste of state property. After our inspection, the actual situation of this issue is explained as follows:
    According to the State Council's regulations, all organs, troops, and organizations occupying and borrowing middle school buildings should gradually return them to the education departments, unless it is genuinely impossible to do so. Therefore, the school buildings of Qian Yancheng Middle School in Xie Yaqian Lane, Suzhou City, originally occupied by our province's No. 1 Rehabilitation Hospital, should be returned to the education department in accordance with the regulations. Moreover, the Provincial Education Department and the Suzhou Municipal Education Bureau repeatedly urged an early return in preparation for use at the beginning of the second semester of 1956. However, because the hospital still had many convalescents at the time, and the processing of staff and all preparations for the closure required a long time, the complete property was not handed over to the Suzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education for management until June 4, 1956. At the time of handover, all equipment was intact. However, after receiving the property, the Suzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education did not use it as a school building but instead used it as a public meeting place for a time. In addition, poor management led to serious damage to the equipment inside the buildings. From the perspective of cherishing public property, we believe it is necessary to point out the responsibility of the Suzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education in this regard. We hope they will conduct an inspection of this situation.

    对批评的反应
    1956年12月6日人民日报第七版读者来信栏登载鲍增元同志写的“严重的浪费现象”一文，批评原江苏省第一康复医院撤消后房屋无人管理，内部设备遭到损坏，希望有关部门对这种损害和浪费国家财产的事情进行检查。现在经过我们进行检查，将这一问题的实际情况说明如下：
    根据国务院的规定：各机关、部队、团体占用和借用中学校舍，除确实不可能交还教育部门的以外，都应逐步交还教育部门。因此，我省原第一康复医院占用苏州市谢衙前巷前晏成中学的校舍自应按照规定，归还教育部门。而且省教育厅及苏州市教育局也屡次催促早日交还，准备1956年下学期开学使用。但因当时该院还有许多休养员，同时工作人员的处理及一切撤消准备工作都需较长时间，因此延至1956年6月4日才将全部房产移交给苏州市文教局接管。移交时所有设备均完好无损。但苏州市文教局接收房产后，并未作校舍使用，而曾一度成为公共会议场所，加之平时管理不善，致使房屋内设备遭受严重损坏。我们认为从爱护公共财产的观点出发，有必要指出苏州市文教部门在这一方面的责任。希望他们对这一情况进行一次检查。
