    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Agricultural Departments Step Up the Supply of Farm Tools, Fertilizers, Draft Animals, and Seeds
    State Banks and Credit Cooperatives to Loan a Large Sum of Spring Farming Production Funds Soon
    (Reported by this newspaper) To support the vast number of farmers in carrying out this year's large-scale production campaign, supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments at all levels are actively preparing and supplying spring farming production materials in large quantities.
    According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives: Supply and marketing systems nationwide have prepared more than 1.6 million units of double-wheeled double-share plows and various iron waterwheels, more than 90,000 units of large agricultural implements such as seeders and disc harrows, and a batch of boiler-locomotives, gas engines, and water pumps. As of the end of January, various regions had prepared more than 535,600 tons of chemical fertilizers, an increase of 48.8% over the same period last year; more than 187,000 tons of chemical pesticides, an increase of 252.7% over the same period last year; and more than 1.54 million units of pesticide equipment, an increase of 249.7% over the same period last year. Most of these materials have been allocated to county and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces have made advance arrangements for the supply of new agricultural implements and other production materials this year.
    Various regions have learned from the lessons of last year's impractical plans and have attached importance to investigation and research. The Zhejiang Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative convened a provincial conference on the supply of rural production materials as early as late December last year, requiring all regions to earnestly learn from the lessons of blindly promoting new agricultural implements last year and to base this year's agricultural implement supply plan on a solid and reliable foundation. The Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Department of Agriculture requested all regions to "eliminate blindness and maintain enthusiasm" when supplying double-wheeled double-share plows, and to conscientiously carry out "technical instruction, experimental demonstration, and publicity and promotion" work to ensure that each new agricultural implement promoted is used and its role is fully发挥发挥. The supply and marketing cooperatives of 19 counties in Shandong, including Wendeng, De, Changi, Junan, and Yiyuan, investigated the needs of 180 agricultural cooperatives for new and old agricultural implements, fertilizers, livestock, seeds, and other production materials in the first quarter of this year, and then formulated sales plans based on those needs.
    Many regions' supply and marketing cooperatives, in order to support agricultural cooperatives in building farmland water conservancy projects, and in view of the relatively little rain and snow last winter and the occurrence of varying degrees of drought in some areas, have attached importance to the supply of power machinery and tools for farmland irrigation. The Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone purchased 100 gas engines in Tianjin. The Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to supply 150,000 waterwheels to meet the needs of spring farming production.
    Regarding small agricultural implements, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have learned from the lessons of the shortage of small agricultural implements during the spring farming season last year. In addition to adopting the method of "local production and sales, self-production and self-use by agricultural cooperatives" as the main approach, preparations have been made for small agricultural implements that cannot be solved locally or for which there is an insufficient supply. The nine counties of Taihu and Zhide in Anhui Province have now prepared more than 420,000 pieces of various old-style small agricultural implements. Wuming County in Guangxi Province has a sufficient supply of local small agricultural implements that can be solved locally. The county and district cooperatives are organizing agricultural and handicraft cooperatives to process them in a timely manner to meet production needs.
    This year, the planned supply of chemical pesticides and pesticide equipment to farmers has increased significantly compared to last year; the supply of chemical fertilizers has also increased somewhat. Jiangsu Province has currently transferred nearly 100 million jin of chemical fertilizers, "666" pesticide powder, and seed-dressing agents to rural areas. In addition, it has also stored and supplied large quantities of local miscellaneous fertilizers, granular fertilizers, oil cakes, bone meal, and other fertilizers. Xinfeng County in Jiangxi Province and other counties have prepared 60,000 tons of lime for fertilizing fields; since the fourth quarter of last year, the supply and marketing cooperative in the suburbs of Tianjin has organized the supply of 110,000 tons of miscellaneous fertilizers.
    In order to support agricultural production, the five key draft animal producing areas of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, and Sichuan have proposed plans to transfer more than 158,000 head of various draft animals, including 62,000 draft horses and more than 87,000 draft cattle. Among the livestock that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is supporting agricultural production in northern provinces this year, there are 20,000 draft horses, more than 17,000 draft cattle, 3,000 mules, and 110,000 ewes. About 30% of these livestock can be shipped out in the first quarter to participate in spring production in various regions in a timely manner. Liaoning and Hebei have signed a procurement agreement with Jilin and Inner Mongolia for 4,500 draft horses. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Anhui and Tianjin have transported more than 2,000 draft horses from Inner Mongolia. Malong and Huaning counties in Yunnan Province have also sent people to Guizhou and other places to purchase draft cattle. At the same time, the state will import 40,000 draft horses from the Mongolian People's Republic.
    Agricultural departments in various regions have arranged for the supply of spring sowing seeds this year. The government has purchased and stored a certain amount of seeds. According to preliminary statistics from 15 provinces including Anhui, Jiangsu, and Guangxi, a total of more than 1.14 billion jin of grain and oilseed crop seeds have been stored. In order to vigorously promote improved varieties, seven provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, and Guangxi have purchased more than 930 million jin of improved varieties. According to statistics, there are more than 420 million jin of cotton seeds stored nationwide, accounting for about 36% of the national cotton field sowing volume.
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th: State banks and credit cooperatives have raised and prepared a large amount of funds needed by farmers for spring farming production.
    The total target for agricultural loans from the Agricultural Bank of China this year has been set at 3.9 billion yuan, an increase of 300 million yuan over last year. Among them, in addition to the 3 billion yuan of loans currently in the hands of farmers that have not been recovered, the actual amount that can be issued this year is 900 million yuan. Most of this 900 million yuan will be issued to farmers before spring farming.
    More than 100,000 rural credit cooperatives nationwide have share capital and deposits of 1.24 billion yuan. At present, basically every township in the country, except for remote ethnic minority areas and pastoral areas, has a credit cooperative. Before spring farming this year, in addition to paying farmers' deposits to farmers for investment in spring farming production, credit cooperatives in various regions also have a considerable amount of funds that can be transferred and loaned to farmers.
    In order to make this year's agricultural loans and credit cooperative loans more reasonable, the Agricultural Bank of China has determined that these two funds should be unified with the state's advance purchase deposits for agricultural products, and used uniformly to avoid unbalanced fund distribution. The focus of loans should also be well grasped. The state bank's loans are mainly issued to agricultural cooperatives as production expenses for the purchase of fertilizers, seeds, small agricultural implements, feed, etc., and appropriate care is also given to farmers' difficulties in life. Credit cooperative loans are first lent to members of agricultural cooperatives to solve production and living difficulties, and if there is any remaining strength, they can also be lent to agricultural cooperatives.

    多方面积极支持农民开展大生产
    供销社和农业部门加紧供应农具、肥料、耕畜和种籽
    国家银行和信用社即将贷放一大笔春耕生产资金
    本报讯　为支持广大农民开展今年大生产运动，各级供销合作社和农业部门积极准备和大量供应春耕生产资料。
    据中华全国供销合作总社统计：全国供销系统已备妥双轮双铧犁和各种铁制水车一百六十多万部、大型农具如播种机和圆盘耙等九万多部，另外还有一批锅驼机、煤气机、水泵等。截至1月底，各地已准备化学肥料五十三万五千六百多吨，较去年同期增加48.8％；化学农药十八万七千多吨，较去年同期增加252.7％；农药器械一百五十四万多架，较去年同期增加249.7％。这些物资大部分已经调拨到县供销社和基层供销社。
    浙江、山东、安徽、湖南、湖北、广西、甘肃、青海等省供销社对今年新式农具等生产资料的供应工作，都提前作了安排。
    各地接受去年计划不切合实际的教训，重视了调查研究工作。浙江省供销社早在去年12月下旬就召开了全省农村生产资料供应工作会议，要求各地认真吸取去年盲目推广新式农具的教训，把今年农具供应计划建立在切实可靠的基础上。广东省供销社和农业厅，要求各地在供应双轮双铧犁的时候，要“去掉盲目性、保持积极性”，并认真做好“技术传授，试验示范，宣传推广”工作，保证新式农具推广一部，使用一部，充分发挥作用。山东文登、德县、昌邑、莒南、沂源等十九县供销社，调查了一百八十个农业社今年第一季度对新旧农具、肥料、牲畜、种子等生产资料需要的情况，然后根据需要，制定了销售计划。
    不少地区的供销社为了支持农业社兴修农田水利建设，并根据去冬雨雪较少，有些地区发生不同程度的干旱现象，重视了农田灌溉动力机械工具的供应工作。仅湖北省供销社在天津就采购了一百台煤气机。河南省供销社配合春耕生产需要，计划供应水车十五万部。
    在小农具方面，各地供销社吸取了去年春耕期间小农具脱销的教训，除采取“地产地销、农业社自产自用”为主的方法外，对当地不能解决或货源不足的小农具，都进行了准备。安徽省太湖、至德等九县现已准备好各种旧式小型农具四十二万多件。广西省武鸣县当地小农具货源充足，可以就地解决，县社和各区社即组织农业社、手工业社及时进行加工，以供应生产上的需要。
    今年计划供应农民的化学农药、农药器械比去年有很大程度的增加；化学肥料也增加了一些。江苏省目前调到农村的化学肥料、“六六六”药粉和拌种用的药剂已近一亿斤。此外还储备和供应了大量土杂肥、颗粒肥料、油饼、骨粉等肥料。江西省信丰等县，已准备好六万吨肥田的石灰；天津市郊区供销社自去年第四季度以来，已组织供应杂肥十一万吨。
    为了支援农业生产，吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古、贵州、四川五个重点耕畜产区，已经提出外调各种耕畜十五万八千多头的计划，其中耕马六万二千匹，耕牛八万七千多头。内蒙古自治区今年支援北方各省农业生产的牲畜中，有耕马两万匹、耕牛一万七千多头、骡子三千头和母羊十一万只。这批牲畜在第一季度可以运出30％左右，以便及时参加各地春季生产。辽宁、河北已和吉林、内蒙古签订了四千五百匹耕马的采购协议。安徽、天津供销社已从内蒙古运到耕马两千多匹。云南省马龙、华宁等县也已派人到贵州等地采购耕牛。同时，国家将从蒙古人民共和国进口耕马四万匹。
    今年春播种子的供应工作，各地农业部门都已作了安排。政府已购储了一定数量的种子。据安徽、江苏、广西等十五个省的初步统计，共储备了粮食、油料作物种子十一亿四千多万斤。为了大力推广优良品种，河北、山东、广东、广西等七省已收购良种九亿三千多万斤。据统计，全国共存有棉花种子四亿二千多万斤，约占全国棉田播种量的36％。
    新华社10日讯　国家银行和信用合作社为农民筹集和准备了大笔春耕生产所需要的资金。
    中国农业银行今年的农业贷款总指标已经确定为三十九亿元，比去年增加三亿元。其中除了现在在农民手中未收回的贷款三十亿元以外，今年实际可发放的数目为九亿元。这九亿元中的大部分将在春耕以前发放给农民。
    全国十万多个农村信用合作社拥有股金和存款十二亿四千万元。目前全国除边远的少数民族地区和牧业区以外，其他地区每个乡基本上都有一个信用合作社。今年春耕以前，各地信用合作社除了把农民的存款支付给农民投入春耕生产以外，还有相当一笔资金可以调剂贷放给农民。
    为了使今年的农业贷款和信用合作社的贷款发放得更为合理，中国农业银行确定要把这两笔资金同国家发放的农产品预购定金统一安排，统一使用，避免资金发放得不平衡。贷款重点也要好好掌握，国家银行的贷款主要发放给农业社作为生产费用，用以购买肥料、种籽、小农具、饲料等，对农民生活上的困难也适当予以照顾。信用合作社的贷款首先贷给农业社社员解决生产、生活上的困难，如果还有余力也可以贷给农业社。
