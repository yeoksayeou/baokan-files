Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 10th. Vice Premier of the State Council, Bo Yibo, met with all the representatives attending the first Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Production Cooperative Representative Conference on the morning of February 9th and delivered a speech. Based on his recent understanding of the situation in rural areas, he emphasized the issues of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and treating the cooperative as one's home. He also explained that running cooperatives requires perseverance and the need for everyone to work hard to consolidate the cooperatives over three to five years. He pointed out that many cooperative members currently do not adequately understand the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. When the cooperative encounters difficulties, they do not work together to overcome them, but instead rely on the cooperative cadres and the state to solve them. There is also a "three不怕" ("three no fear") mentality: first, not fearing owing the state; second, not fearing owing middle peasants; and third, not fearing owing taxes. It is not good for an agricultural cooperative to owe a lot of debt. He said: To run an agricultural cooperative well, one should start a business diligently and thriftily, and cannot rely solely on state support. Consolidating an agricultural cooperative by relying on debt is not possible. We should educate cooperative members that only by relying on themselves, working hard, and managing their households diligently and thriftily can the agricultural cooperative be consolidated more firmly. To run a cooperative diligently and thriftily, there must be some accumulation. Some peasants say that they will not buy houses or land in the future, and their children's marriages will be free, so they do not need to spend money. Therefore, when they have money, they spend it, which is not in line with the principle of running a household diligently and thriftily. The most important issue at present is to educate cooperative members to cherish the agricultural cooperative and treat it as their own home. Every blade of grass and tree must be carefully protected, so that they understand that only by running the cooperative well can their own lives be better.

He also said: Through everyone's efforts, the cooperatives were run very well last year. Can they be run well this year and next year as well? This depends on everyone's concerted efforts. It should take three to five years to consolidate the cooperatives. One cannot expect to fully demonstrate the superiority of advanced cooperatives within a year; therefore, it is inevitable that some cooperatives will not be run very well in the first year. Do not attempt to run all cooperatives well in one or two years, but rely on continuously summarizing experience. It will take three to five years to run all cooperatives well. He asked the representatives to explain this principle clearly to the cooperative members. Being a cooperative director is indeed not an easy task. One must be able to calculate accounts, record work points, and also learn to follow the mass line. Cooperative cadres also need to practice for several years to learn their skills well. Running a cooperative requires perseverance. First, believe that the collective is better than the individual; second, believe that the cooperative is better than individual farming. In this way, one can feel happy during a bumper harvest and will not lose confidence even after a reduction in production.

Bo Yibo then talked about the relationship between workers and peasants. He said that this time in the countryside, he heard and saw that some peasants were not content to produce in the countryside, and they had some misunderstandings about the relationship between workers and peasants. For example, they believe that public servants are all supported by peasants, and workers do not contribute to the country's burden; workers have good lives, peasants have bad lives; workers' labor is easy, and peasants' labor is heavy, etc. He said that in the past, during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, public servants were indeed supported by peasants, and even only by peasants in mountainous areas. But now the situation has changed. It is no longer entirely the case that peasants support public servants. On the contrary, the state's investment in farmland and water conservancy and the issuance of agricultural loans are very large. He said that socialist construction relies on peasants and even more on workers; neither can be missing. The improvement of peasants' lives can only be achieved by running cooperatives better, not by reducing workers' wages, because workers' production is mechanized, workers' labor is complex labor, and the value created by workers is greater than that of peasants, so it is reasonable that their remuneration is slightly higher.

He also made a specific comparison of the average annual income and expenditure of workers and peasants, explaining that the cost of living in cities is higher than in rural areas, and the actual living standards of workers and peasants are still about the same. As for some people who think that workers' labor is easy, they only need to visit a factory to know that this statement is not in line with the facts. He emphasized that in the great cause of building socialism, industry and agriculture must support each other, and workers and peasants must unite as one.

Finally, Bo Yibo expressed his hope that the representatives would actively respond to Chairman Mao's call, try every means to strive for a bumper harvest in 1957, produce more grain, and increase income from sideline occupations. 70% of Shanxi is mountainous area, and agricultural income is limited, so more attention should be paid to the development of sideline occupations. The policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry is particularly important in mountainous areas. We must strive to unremittingly struggle for several five-year plans to fundamentally change the original poverty of the barren mountainous areas and make the cause of cooperation more consolidated and more developed.

    薄一波副总理向山西农业社代表讲话
    办社要有坚韧性
    应该用三年到五年功夫把社巩固起来
    新华社太原10日电　国务院副总理薄一波9日上午，会见了出席山西省农业生产合作社第一次代表会议的全体代表，并且讲了话。他就最近在农村了解的情况，着重地讲了勤俭办社、以社为家的问题，并且说明办社要有坚韧性，要靠大家努力，用三年到五年功夫，把社巩固起来。他指出目前不少的社员对勤俭办社的方针理解得很不够。社里遇到困难不是共同努力克服，而是依靠社干部、依靠国家解决。还有一种“三不怕”的思想：一不怕欠国家的债；二不怕欠中农的债；三不怕欠税款。一个农业社欠了很多债是不好的。他说：办好农业社，应该是勤俭起家，不能光依靠国家支援，靠欠债是不能巩固农业社的，应该教育社员只有依靠自己，艰苦奋斗，勤俭持家，农业社才能巩固得更牢靠。要勤俭办社，就要有些积累。有些农民说，今后不置房买地，儿女们结婚也是自由恋爱，用不着花钱了，所以手中有了钱，就花掉了，这是不符合勤俭持家的原则的。当前最主要的问题是教育社员爱护农业社，把农业社当成自己的家，一草一木，都要加意爱护，使他们懂得：只有办好社，自己的生活才能过得更好。
    他还说：经过大家的努力，去年社办得很好。今年、明年是不是也能办好？这要靠大家的一致努力。应该用三年到五年的功夫，把社巩固起来。不能希望在一年内，就把高级社的优越性完全显示出来；因此有些社在第一年办得不很好是难免的。不要企图在一、二年内就把所有的合作社都办得很好，要依靠不断地总结经验，经过三年至五年的时间，才能够把所有的社办好。他要求代表们向社员讲清楚这个道理。当个社主任，确实是件不容易的事情，要会算账，会记工分，还要学会走群众路线，社干部也要经过几年的练习，才能学好本领。办社要有坚韧性，第一要相信集体比个人好，第二要相信合作社比单干好。这样，才能在丰收的时候感到愉快，在减产以后也同样不会失掉信心。
    薄一波接着谈到了工农关系问题。他说，这一次在农村听到和看到有些农民不安心在农村生产，并且对工农关系有一些误解。譬如认为公家人都是农民养活的，工人不给国家出负担；工人生活好，农民生活坏，工人劳动轻，农民的劳动重等等。他说，过去在抗日战争和解放战争时期，公家人确实是农民养活的，甚至只是山区农民养活的。但是现在情况变化了，不是完全由农民养活公家人了，相反的，国家对农田、水利的投资和发放农贷的数字却是很大的。他说，搞社会主义建设要靠农民，更要靠工人，缺少谁也不行。农民的生活改善只有靠合作社办得更好，不是把工人的工资减低，因为工人的生产是机械化的，工人的劳动是复杂的劳动，工人创造的价值比农民大，所以报酬也稍微高一些是合理的。
    他并且把工人和农民每年的平均收入和支出作了具体对比，说明城市生活费用比农村高，工人和农民的实际生活水平还是差不多的。至于有人认为工人劳动轻，那只要到工厂去参观一趟，就知道这种说法不符合事实了。他强调说，在建设社会主义伟大事业中，工业和农业必须互相支援，工人和农民必须团结一致。
    最后，薄一波希望代表们积极响应毛主席的号召，想尽一切办法，争取1957年的大丰收，粮食打得更多，副业的收入也更多。山西70％的地区是山区，农业收入有限，更要重视发展副业，农林牧全面发展的方针在山区特别重要。要努力用几个五年计划的时间坚持不懈地奋斗下去，使贫瘠的山区从根本上改变原来的贫困面貌，使合作化的事业，更加巩固，更加发展。
