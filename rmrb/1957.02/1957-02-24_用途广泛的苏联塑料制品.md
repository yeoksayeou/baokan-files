    Visitors to Moscow often like to take away a beautiful, lightweight, and inexpensive souvenir: various plastic plates and boxes printed or engraved with various images and patterns.
    The doors and tables inside the Moscow-Beijing "Tu-104" aircraft are decorated with a layer of glossy plastic.
    The first car with a plastic body has appeared on the streets of Moscow. Now, scientific research institutes are experimenting with using fiberglass plastic for the body of the "Moskvich" car.
    The use of plastics, in the Soviet Union as in countries around the world, is becoming more widespread every day. World production of plastics in 1929 was only 85,000 tons, but by 1955 it had increased to 3 million tons. Soviet industry now produces 2,100 kinds of plastic products, and by 1960 the output of plastic products will double.
    There are many raw materials for plastic products: coal, petroleum, natural gas, salt, wood shavings – anything can be used. So there is no shortage of sources, and the cost is very low. In a telephone factory in the Soviet Union, I saw workers pour a spoonful of coal dust into a mold, pass an electric current through it, and press it to make the bakelite case for a telephone. Plastic products reduce the operation of many machine tools and machinists because only one operation remains: molding.
    Plastic products are widely used to replace metal. They are fireproof and waterproof, rustproof and corrosion-resistant, and even stronger than metal. In the Soviet automotive and tractor industry alone, more than 350 parts are made of plastic. The Soviet Plastics Research Institute has produced a plastic to replace lead-tin solder, which can be used to repair cracks or dents on metal car bodies without leaving a trace. Soviet engineers have used plastic to make printing type, which is nine-tenths lighter and half the price of lead type. Plastic type can print up to 150,000 impressions, while metal type can only print up to 40,000 impressions.
    Soviet industry has recently begun producing fluoroplastics No. 3 and No. 4, which are successfully used to replace steel, silver, and gold. Containers made of this plastic can hold corrosive liquids for a long time. These containers can hold hot hydrochloric acid and nitric acid or their mixtures. Covering a metal with a thin film of fluoroplastic prevents corrosion from external concentrations of acids and alkalis.
    A plastic called polyethylene is also used in everyday life in the Soviet Union. Polyethylene is an ideal dielectric for communication technology. Telephone lines made of it can carry from 20 to 480 conversations simultaneously. Fruits, vegetables, bread, and other items can be kept fresh for a long time in bags made of polyethylene. Foods such as salt, sugar, and flour do not become damp when stored in these bags in humid places. Nurseries also use polyethylene covers to resist the attacks of severe cold.
    There is also a plastic synthesized from carbolic acid and formalin. Soviet engineers used it to make "miracle sand." This sand is a free substance. Seawater becomes potable fresh water after being filtered through it. Many newly reclaimed areas use it to purify drinking water. This sand is also used to separate rare metals from minerals and vitamins and amino acids from animals and plants.
    Soviet scientists have solved the problem of manufacturing artificial rubber and synthetic fibers themselves. These are two plastics with unlimited uses. Not long ago, Western bourgeois publications predicted that the Soviet Union would not be able to produce artificial rubber. Now, Western scientists are surprised that Soviet artificial rubber is stronger than real rubber, both durable and frost-resistant. Not long ago, chemically synthesized fibers appeared on the international market, and their production process was still a secret to the Soviet Union at that time. However, after their own painstaking exploration, Soviet chemists finally found a suitable catalyst and obtained synthetic fibers.
    The firmness of synthetic fibers exceeds that of cotton, wool, and silk. In addition to nylon, kapron, and anide, there is also a stronger lavsan. It is not afraid of relatively high temperatures and does not deform under considerable pressure. The Soviet Union now produces 400 million meters of synthetic fiber textiles, and the production of this youngest textile will increase to 2 billion meters by 1960. (Li He)

### 用途广泛的苏联塑料制品

    用途广泛的苏联塑料制品
    到莫斯科作客的人们，临别时候很喜欢带走一种又美观、又轻巧、又便宜的纪念品，那就是用塑料制成的各色盘子、盒子，上面印着、刻着各种画像、图案。
    来往在莫斯科—北京之间的“图—104”飞机里面的门、桌，装饰着一层光泽的塑料。
    在莫斯科街道上出现过第一辆用塑料做车身的汽车。现在科学研究所在试验以玻璃塑料做“莫斯科人”牌汽车的车身。
    塑料的用途，在苏联正如在世界各国一样，一天比一天广泛。世界各国在1929年还只出产了八万五千吨塑料，而在1955年已增加到三百万吨。苏联工业现在出产着二千一百种塑料制品，到1960年塑料制品的产量还要增加二倍。
    塑料制品的原料很多：煤、石油、天然气、食盐、木屑，无所不可。所以来源不缺而且成本很低。在苏联一个电话机制造厂，我见过工人把一勺煤末倒在模型里，通过电流，一压便制出了电话机的电木壳。塑料制品使许多机床和车工的操作减少了，因为只剩下一项压模的操作了。
    塑料制品被普遍用来代替金属。它们不怕火不怕水，不锈不蚀，比金属还强。仅仅苏联汽车和拖拉机工业中就有三百五十多种零件是用塑料制造的。苏联塑料研究所制出了一种代替铅锡焊料的塑料，用它可以把汽车的金属车身上的裂缝或凹凸弥补得无痕无迹。苏联工程师用塑料制造了印刷的活字，它们比铅字轻十分之九，贱一半。塑料活字能印到十五万印张，而金属活字只能印到四万印张。
    苏联工业最近开始生产第三号和第四号氟化塑料，用它们成功地代替钢、银、金。用这种塑料制成的容器，能够长久保持腐蚀性的液体。这种容器可以盛灼热的盐酸和硝酸或者它们的混合物。盖上一层氟化塑料薄膜的金属，便防止了外来的浓度的酸和碱的腐蚀。
    一种叫做聚合乙烯的塑料，在苏联也被使用到日常生活中去了。聚合乙烯对于通讯技术是比较理想的电介质。用它制的电话线，可以同时进行从二十起到四百八十起的对话。水果、蔬菜、面包和其他物品，放在用聚合乙烯制的袋子中，可以长期地保持新鲜。盐、糖、面粉等等食物装在这种袋子中，放在潮湿地方也不发潮。苗圃里也使用聚合乙烯制的罩子，来抵抗严寒的袭击。
    又有一种石炭酸和福马林合成的塑料。苏联工程师用它制成“奇妙的沙子”。这种沙子是游离物。海水经它过滤后便成为可饮的淡水。许多新开垦地区用它来滤清饮水。这种沙子还用来从矿物中分出稀有金属，从动植物中分出维他命和氨基酸。
    苏联科学家已经自己解决了制造人造橡胶和合成纤维问题。这是两种用途无限广阔的塑料。不久以前西方资产阶级刊物曾预言苏联制造不出人造橡胶来，现在西方科学家惊讶苏联的人造橡胶比真橡胶还强，既耐用又耐冻。不久以前国际市场上出现了化学合成纤维，它的生产过程对苏联来说，当时还是秘密的。但是苏联化学家经过自己辛勤的探索，终于找到了恰当的催化剂，取得了合成纤维。
    合成纤维的坚固性超过棉、毛、丝。除了尼隆、卡普朗、安尼以外，还出产一种更结实的拉普桑。它不怕相当高的温度，受相当重的压力也不变形。苏联如今生产四亿公尺合成纤维纺织品，这种最年轻的纺织品的生产到1960年将提高到二十亿公尺。　　　（李何）
