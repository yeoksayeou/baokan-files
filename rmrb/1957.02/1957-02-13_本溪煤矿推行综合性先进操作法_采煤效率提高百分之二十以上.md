    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Benxi Coal Mine workers have been promoting a comprehensive advanced coal mining method - the Wang Hengcheng, Yu Chengyi, and others comprehensive operation method since February 7. According to the performance in the experimental stage, the use of this method can increase coal mining efficiency by more than 20%.

    The Wang Hengcheng, Yu Chengyi, and others comprehensive operation method is a summary of the experiences of outstanding pneumatic drill operators in the entire mine after repeated comparisons by leaders and workers of Benxi Coal Mine. Many pneumatic drill operators in Benxi Coal Mine have their own specialties: some are fast at door opening, some are fast at pushing and penetrating stacks, and some are fast at digging beam nests and supporting frames. Although these operating methods included various processes of coal mining, in the past they only gave play to their respective specialties without learning from each other's strengths and summarizing a complete coal mining method. Generally, coal mining workers learned their experiences, but because they could only learn the operating methods of some of them, the effect was not great. Based on this situation, in late January, the leaders of Benxi Coal Mine convened Wang Hengcheng, Yu Chengyi, and other outstanding pneumatic drill operators to perform technological demonstrations in turn in working faces with different conditions. After observation, evaluation, and comparison by coal mining workers and identification by technical personnel, a complete set of advanced coal mining methods was finally synthesized and promoted throughout the mine.

    In order to enable coal mining workers to truly master this advanced operating method, the leadership specially organized outstanding pneumatic drill operators to personally teach in each coal mining section when promoting this experience. In the process of their performances, whether mining in medium-hardness coal seams or grade one hardness and special grade hardness coal seams, they showed outstanding results.

    本溪煤矿推行综合性先进操作法
    采煤效率提高百分之二十以上
    据新华社讯　本溪煤矿工人从2月7日起推行一种综合性的先进采煤方法——王恒成、于成义等综合操作法。根据试验阶段的表演证明，运用这种操作法可以提高采煤效率20％以上。
    王恒成、于成义等综合操作方法，是本溪煤矿领导干部和工人反复比较了全矿优秀风镐手的经验以后总结出来的。本溪煤矿的很多风镐手都各有各的特长，有的拉门开邦快，有的推垛透垛快，有的掏梁子窝支架快。虽然这些操作方法包括了采煤过程的各个工序，但是他们过去只发挥各自的特长，而没有互相取长补短，总结出一套完整的采煤方法；一般采煤工人学习他们的经验，由于只能学得他们之中个别人的操作方法，收效不大。本溪煤矿领导方面根据这种情况，在1月下旬召集王恒成、于成义等优秀风镐手，让他们在各种条件不同的掌子里轮流作工艺表演。经过采煤工人的观摩评比和技术人员的鉴定，最后综合出了一套完整的先进采煤方法，在全矿推广。
    为了使采煤工人能够真正掌握这种先进操作方法，在推广这一经验的时候领导方面特别组织优秀风镐手亲自到各采煤段传授。他们在表演过程中，不论在中等硬度煤层或者一级硬度、特级硬度煤层采煤，都表现出出色的成绩。
