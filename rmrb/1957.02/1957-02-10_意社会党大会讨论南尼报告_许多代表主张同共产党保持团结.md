Xinhua News Agency, Venice, 8th: According to TASS, the General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, Pietro Nanni, delivered a political report at the Socialist Party Congress on the evening of the 6th.

    A significant portion of Nanni's report addressed the relationship between the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party. He also discussed the issue of unified action between Socialists and Communists.

    Nanni also spoke about the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, particularly the resolution on overcoming the consequences of the cult of personality, and about the events in Poland and Hungary. He also discussed the domestic situation in Italy, pointing out that the working masses' dissatisfaction with the status quo was growing.

    The Congress began on the 7th to discuss Nanni's report and the report of the Party's leadership, which was published last December.

    The representative of the Party's Florence Provincial Committee, Senator Buzoni, pointed out in his speech that the Socialists should not abandon efforts to merge with the Social Democrats, but the merger should be realized unhurriedly on the basis of a clear class stand. He demanded that the Party's leaders not abuse their power and not force the Party to accept decisions that most Socialists consider premature. He emphasized that the most important task of the Socialist Party is to adhere to the fraternal friendship with the Italian Communist Party and, in the face of the common enemy—capitalism—to safeguard the unity of the working class with the greatest determination.

    Tonietti, a veteran Socialist Party member and Member of Parliament with more than forty years of Party membership, criticized the Socialist Party's leadership, especially for starting negotiations with the Social Democratic leaders on the issue of merger without the full knowledge of the general Party members. He pointed out that the mistakes made by the Socialist Party's leadership in the formulation of the merger issue had caused divisions within the Party.

    He advocated that the Socialists implement a policy of transforming the country in a socialist spirit. He pointed out that this transformation is impossible without the participation of the Communists and if the main principles of Marxism-Leninism are violated.

    Other delegates spoke in support of the documents issued by the Party's leadership and Nanni's report before the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Venice, 8th: The 32nd Congress of the Italian Socialist Party continued to discuss General Secretary Nanni's report and the report of the Party's leadership published last December.

    Party leadership committee members Tolloy, Martino, Lombardi, Varori, and others spoke in favor of the principles of these two reports.

    When many delegates spoke about the issue of merging the Socialist Party with the Social Democratic Party, they expressed opposition to the Social Democrats' demands for splitting the working-class movement and splitting with the Communists.

    Delegate Lussu spoke about the attitude towards the October Revolution. He said that the Socialists recognize the historical regularity of the October Revolution and recognize that this revolution will forever be a lesson and example for all those who are determined to build socialism according to certain national conditions.

    Delegate Giacometti pointed out that it is necessary to maintain the unity of the working class and the unity with the socialist camp countries.

    意社会党大会讨论南尼报告
    许多代表主张同共产党保持团结
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社威尼斯讯：意大利社会党总书记彼特罗·南尼在社会党代表大会6日晚间会议上作了政治报告。
    南尼的报告中有相当大的一部分谈到关于社会党和社会民主党之间的相互关系。他也谈到了社会党人和共产党人行动一致的问题。
    南尼还谈到了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，特别是关于克服个人崇拜的后果的决议，并且谈到波、匈事件。他也谈到了意大利的国内情况，指出劳动群众不满现状的情绪在增长。
    代表大会7日开始讨论南尼的报告和在去年12月发表的党的领导机构的报告。
    党的佛罗伦萨省委员会代表、上议员布佐尼在发言中指出：社会党人不要放弃同社会民主党人合并的努力，但是，应当在鲜明的阶级立场的基础上不慌不忙地实现合并。他要求党的领导人员不要滥用自己的职权，不要强迫党接受大多数社会党人认为为时过早的决定。他强调说，社会党最重要的任务是坚持同意大利共产党的兄弟友好关系，在共同的敌人——资本主义面前，以最大的决心维护工人阶级的团结。
    有四十多年党龄的社会党老党员、议员托内提批评了社会党的领导人员，特别是批评党的领导人员在一般党员完全不知道的情况下同社会民主党领袖们开始谈判合并问题。他指出，社会党领导人员在合并问题的提法上所犯的错误引起了党内的意见分歧。
    他主张社会党人执行以社会主义精神改造国家的政策。他指出，如果没有共产党人的参加，如果违背马克思列宁主义的主要原则，这种改造是不可能实现的。
    另外一些代表发言拥护会前所发的党的领导机关的文件和南尼的报告。
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社威尼斯8日讯：意大利社会党第三十二次代表大会继续讨论总书记南尼的报告和党的领导机构在去年12月发表的报告。
    党领导机构委员托洛伊、马蒂诺、龙巴迪、瓦罗里等发言赞同这两个报告的原则。
    许多代表在发言中谈到社会党同社会民主党合并的问题的时候，表示反对社会民主党人提出的分裂工人阶级运动和同共产党人分裂的要求。
    代表路苏在发言中谈到了对待十月革命的态度问题。他说，社会党人承认十月革命所具有的历史规律性，并且承认，这个革命对于一切决心根据一定的民族条件建成社会主义的人永远具有教训和范例的意义。
    代表亚科梅蒂指出，必须保持工人阶级的团结和同社会主义阵营国家的团结。
