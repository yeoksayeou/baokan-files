Introducing Discussions on Logic in the Soviet Union and East Germany
Jiang Tianji

I

    The Soviet journal "Problems of Philosophy" conducted a discussion on logic in 1950 and 1951. The articles participating in this discussion have been compiled and published by Sanlian Bookstore. The situation of the Soviet discussion on logic is not unfamiliar to the broad masses of readers in our country.
    In November 1951, philosophical workers in East Germany began a discussion on logic at a philosophical conference. Later, articles participating in the discussion were published in the theoretical journal "Einheit" of the Socialist Unity Party and in the "German Philosophy Journal." In particular, since the "German Philosophy Journal" was founded in 1953, it has continued to discuss logic. We do not yet have sufficient information to make a more comprehensive introduction and analysis. However, judging from some of the articles we have read, it can be determined that the various representative viewpoints that appeared in the Soviet Union also appeared in East Germany. Regarding the relationship between formal logic and materialist dialectics, there are also two basically opposing views: one acknowledges dialectical logic as distinct from formal logic; the other takes a skeptical or negative attitude towards dialectical logic.
    The discussion in the "German Philosophy Journal" began with a paper by W. Harich published in the first issue of 1953. Harich made a comprehensive rebuttal to an article published by E. Hofmann in the "Einheit" magazine the previous year. The basic arguments of both sides are briefly described below:
    Hofmann believes that the object of formal logic is thinking, the laws of thinking, and the forms of thinking that provide objective truth. The object of dialectical logic is also thinking and its laws and forms. Therefore, the difference between formal logic and dialectical logic "lies not in the difference of objects, but in the different methods used for the same object, and in the different methods of understanding the object." Hofmann pointed out that formal logic studies its object with the help of the law of identity, the law of contradiction, the law of excluded middle, and the law of sufficient reason. "Dialectical logic uses the dialectical method, it studies thinking and its laws and forms with the help of the dialectical method."
    According to Hofmann, the main thing is the difference between the formal logic method and the dialectical logic method: "The formal logic method is based on the application of four preliminary laws of thinking. Therefore, formal logic can only provide preliminary knowledge about reality," while "the dialectical logic method is based on the application of the dialectical method," so it can provide sufficient knowledge about reality. Knowledge of the dialectical nature of reality can only be achieved by breaking through the limitations established by the four preliminary laws.
    The above is Hofmann's basic argument. The concepts he uses when expressing his views are not precise enough. Two points are pointed out here: First, he says that formal logic uses four laws of thinking to study its object. Does this "object" refer to the forms and laws of thinking themselves, or to the objects of objective reality? If it refers to the former, then formal logic uses the laws of thinking to study the laws of thinking, so Harich pointed this out to refute him. But his so-called "object" can also refer to objects in objective reality, because he said that the application of the four laws of thinking provides preliminary knowledge about reality. At least in expression, he did not distinguish between the object of formal logic as a science and the object of the formal logic method. Secondly, he said that the method of dialectical logic is based on the application of the dialectical method. This statement is also inaccurate. To express his meaning accurately, it should be like this: the dialectical logic method is based on the application of the laws of dialectics (also laws of thinking); just as the method of formal logic is based on the application of the law of identity, etc.
    However, on the issue of the relationship between formal logic and dialectical logic, Hofmann's argument is very clear. He believes that: (1) formal logic is also a method of understanding real objects, and it is a different method of thinking from dialectics; (2) the formal logic method of applying the law of identity, etc. to understand reality can only provide preliminary knowledge about objects, and it is necessary to break through the limitations of the four preliminary laws to obtain sufficient knowledge about objects.
    On this issue, Harich's argument is directly opposed to Hofmann's. He first raises the question of whether formal logic is a method of thinking: can the application of the four laws of thinking become a method of thinking? Can formal logic provide knowledge about objective reality? His answer is negative. He said: "Metaphysics is a framework that restricts knowledge, which is overcome by the application of materialist dialectics. Formal logic is not like this, so its norms do not become invalid with the overcoming of metaphysics. But it itself generally cannot obtain knowledge, so in this respect, its achievements are smaller than the achievements of the narrow method of metaphysical observation of phenomena itself." ("German Philosophy Journal" first issue of 1953, page 194) Therefore, Harich believes that only dialectics and metaphysics are methods of understanding phenomena, are methods of thinking, while formal logic is not a method of thinking and cannot provide knowledge. Secondly, Harich raises the question of the relationship between "correct logical thinking" and dialectical knowledge: are the characteristics of the dialectical method and the regularity of logical thinking contradictory or incompatible? His answer to this question is also negative. He pointed out that "logical thinking connects the same words with the same definite concepts, it affirms judgments that can be combined according to the law of contradiction, it draws consistent conclusions from existing premises, it avoids errors in reasoning, such as four terms, circular argumentation, etc." According to his view, formal-logically correct thinking is precisely the logical aspect of dialectical knowledge. The two are like the relationship between form and content, and abstract logical form and concrete dialectical knowledge are mutually presupposing and complementary.
    In short, Harich's basic argument is as follows: (1) formal logic is not a method of thinking, it cannot provide any knowledge; (2) logical thinking constitutes an aspect of dialectical knowledge, namely the logical form aspect of dialectical knowledge. Therefore, Harich denies that dialectics is "higher" logic, and denies that the relationship between formal logic and dialectics is the relationship between elementary logic and advanced logic. He advocates calling formal logic logic, because the word "formal" seems redundant.
    Then, is there dialectical logic? Harich believes that when Engels used the term "dialectical logic," he was referring to the dialectical materialist theory of formal logic; when Lenin used the same term, he was referring to the dialectical materialist method of thinking. The dialectical materialist theory of logic was formed in the process of fighting against idealism and metaphysics. It includes the following issues: the relationship between language and thinking; the essence of logical laws (are they laws of existence or laws of thinking); the objective basis for the correctness of reasoning laws; the interrelationship of various judgment and reasoning forms; the relationship and distinction between logic and psychology, epistemology, methodology, grammar, etc. All doctrines about these issues can be collectively called "dialectical logic."
    Harich's rebuttal to Hofmann has received the approval of many participants in the discussion, so I have made a more detailed introduction above. For example, G. Klaus, who basically agrees with Harich's view, said: "I am fully convinced that it is unnecessary to use the concept of 'dialectical logic,' it is better to call it Marxist dialectics... Logic is indeed formal, and here people must fully agree with Paul Link's view." ("German Philosophy Journal" fourth issue of 1954, page 913; for Paul Link's argument, see the same journal second issue of 1953, pages 357-358). Bauman's article on logic published not long ago in the "German Philosophy Journal" second issue of 1956 also has similar views. They all believe that logic and formal logic are equivalent, and it seems impossible to have non-formal logic.
    These two opposing arguments appear everywhere in the discussion of logic, and representatives can be found in the Soviet Union, East Germany, and our country. The dispute seems difficult to resolve. What is the key to the debate between the two sides? The key lies in what logical laws are applied in the process of understanding reality according to the Marxist dialectical method? Are they the laws of formal logic, or some other laws of thinking? Although people can, like Harich, believe that formal logic is not a method of thinking and cannot provide knowledge about objective reality, and that dialectical logic is only Marxist doctrine about formal logic; or, like Klaus, believe that logic must be formal and that the concept of dialectical logic should be discarded. But the key question we have raised still exists and must be answered. Different answers to this question divide the two opposing arguments: one argument says: in order to obtain comprehensive and sufficient knowledge about reality (such as knowledge about the dialectical development process of objects), it is necessary to break through the limitations of formal logic laws, as Hofmann's view is like this. The other argument believes that the truthfulness of thought or the highest standard of knowledge lies in the consistency of dialectical knowledge and formal logic laws. If it is not in accordance with the laws of formal logic, the dialectical method cannot obtain any knowledge. This is the view of Hofmann's opponents.
    Now this key question can be expressed as follows: Under the premise of acknowledging the correctness of formal logic laws themselves, is their application to the real world (strictly speaking: applying them to understanding the real world) universally valid, or is there a limitation to the scope of application? Below, we will briefly comment on the answers given by some Soviet logicians to this question recently.

II

    P. Tcherkesov raises this key question in this way, he said: "Is it possible to reflect the facts of movement, change, and development in consciousness with the method of formal logic? People who advocate the universal nature of formal logic answer this question affirmatively. They believe that the laws of thinking and the forms of thinking expressed by formal logic are more than enough to reflect any connection and any regularity of the objective world" ("Study Translation Series" ninth issue of 1956, page 18). If we ask the question more specifically, then for such a question: "According to what logical laws should movement be reflected?" there may be the following different answers.
    First, the view of those who advocate the universal validity of formal logic, represented by Bakradze. Bakradze said: "The 'simplest' and most complex relationships between things and phenomena are subject to dialectics. When understanding all phenomena and all relationships, whether the simplest or the most complex, thinking must abide by the laws of logic" ("Collection of Discussions on Logic Problems", Sanlian Bookstore edition, page 10). From this view, it can be concluded that thinking reflects movement according to the logical law of contradiction. But this view contains a premise, which, if stated clearly, is like this: dialectical laws (such as the law of the unity of opposites) only work in the objective world, and formal logic laws (such as the law of contradiction) only work in thinking. As Lenin pointed out, "That is to say, thinking and existence are not connected" (Lenin: "Philosophical Notebooks" page 258), the laws of thinking and the laws of existence are inconsistent. This makes it difficult to explain why thinking can reflect existence.
    The second view, in order to avoid the obvious errors of the first, admits that it is necessary to reflect movement according to the law of the unity of opposites, but believes that this reflection must also conform to the formal logic law of contradiction, otherwise it is incorrect. People who hold this view can admit the role of the law of the unity of opposites in cognition, but they also believe that this law is only a principle of the method of thinking, and it must be combined with the formal logic law of contradiction, just like the mutual combination of content and form. Representatives of this view can be found in the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, and our country. The views of Harich introduced above belong to this type. Polish philosopher A. Schaff also has similar views. Schaff said: "... Only by taking into account the logical law of contradiction can we understand the viewpoint of dialectical change and development, and can we consciously talk about this viewpoint" ("Study Translation Series" eleventh issue of 1956, page 44). But this view is unclear about the relationship between the method of thinking and logic. It only affirms that formal logic and dialectical methods can be combined, but it cannot explain and solve the relationship between the two.
    The second view is essentially the same as the first. It affirms the universal validity of formal logic laws, but at the same time does not deny the role of dialectical laws in cognition. Therefore, they are essentially the same, because this view also leads to the inconsistency of logical form and the content of cognition. In fact, there are fewer people who hold the first view, and most people who advocate the universal validity of formal logic adopt the second view.
    The third view is directly opposed to the view that admits the universal validity of formal logic. It is represented by P. Tcherkesov, M. Alekseyev, and D. Gorsky, etc. Tcherkesov first affirms that "we can reflect movement and development in their original form with thought," and secondly, "movement can only be reflected in this way on the basis of applying the law of the unity of opposites" ("Study Translation Series" ninth issue of 1956, page 19). When criticizing Schaff's argument cited above, Alekseyev pointed out: "To reduce the explanation of the dialectical movement process to the logical law of non-contradiction means rejecting the scientific explanation of movement." He said: "The content of the dialectical law of the unity and struggle of opposites is completely different from the content of the formal logic law of non-contradiction. ... The logical law of non-contradiction itself can never explain dialectical contradictions. It is impossible to understand dialectical contradictions with the help of this law, and it is even more impossible to prove this contradiction with its help" ("Study Translation Series" eleventh issue of 1956, page 45). But the clearest and most specific answer to this key question is given by Gorsky, one of the editors of the newly compiled "Logic" by the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1956. He said: "Although the scope of application of formal logic laws is very broad, ... however, these laws will lose their effectiveness under certain conditions (for example, when we cannot set aside the development and change of the object being studied)." To give a concrete example, the judgment "movement is intermittent and non-intermittent" is true in terms of content, contradictory in terms of form, and "from the perspective of formal logic used to analyze our thoughts, all thoughts that are formally contradictory must be wrong. In such places, the method of formal logic loses its effectiveness, so at this time, we must analyze the thoughts based on the essence of the concrete content of the thoughts. When analyzing the essence of the content of this judgment, we can treat it as true regardless of the form of this judgment" (Soviet Academy of Sciences 1956 newly compiled "Logic" first chapter, the translation is based on the translation by the Logic Teaching and Research Section of Peking University, the same below). That is to say, thoughts that seem wrong according to the laws of formal logic can be true according to the specific content. At this time, the laws of formal logic become invalid and must give way to the laws of dialectics. This shows the limitations of formal logic. Gorsky hurriedly stated here: "This limitation of the scope of application of formal logic laws ... must not be understood as, for example, that we can contradict ourselves when we talk about movement and developing objects" (the same book, first chapter, emphasis added by the quotation). Despite this statement, in the view of people who study formal logic, the claim that the law of contradiction can fail is always contrary to common sense, and even a harmful and dangerous idea.
    Therefore, among Marxists, regarding this sharply raised question: "Does the logical law of contradiction (or called the law of non-contradiction) apply to reflecting movement?" there are essentially two different views: Some people firmly believe that the validity of the law of contradiction must be maintained everywhere. This view is consistent with common sense and easily accepted by everyone. Others believe that the law of contradiction is not applicable when reflecting movement, but self-contradiction is not allowed in discussion. Marxists who oppose this view may think so, but Gorsky and others do not think so. The crux of the dispute lies here. Let's take a look at this argument represented by Gorsky.
    Gorsky believes that the scope of application of formal logic laws is limited, but we must abide by these laws in any discussion. For example, the law of contradiction is invalid when recognizing the movement of objects, but we do not allow self-contradiction in discussion. He said: "There should be no formal contradictions in any argument or any scientific system. These contradictions will destroy the system" ("Logic" chapter 16). How to understand his view?
    Some people emphasize the effectiveness of formal logic laws, especially the law of contradiction, in scientific theory. For example, Polish philosopher Schaff pointed out in his famous book "Several Problems of the Marxist Theory of Truth": "According to the Marxist classics, contradictions in the sense of logical contradiction are not allowed in the system. Therefore, if a self-contradictory conclusion can be deduced from a statement (that is, two judgments, one of which negates what the other affirms), this statement is false. It can be clearly seen from the remarks of the Marxist classics that they believe that the incorrectness of a system lies in proving its logical contradiction" (German edition, page 111, emphasis added by the quotation). There is no doubt that Schaff's words are correct. He is talking about the effectiveness of the law of contradiction in proof and its role in the theoretical system. This is also what Gorsky emphasized. We all agree that the discovery of any contradiction is the destruction of the scientific system. In the process of proof, if two mutually contradictory judgments are allowed, then any conclusion can be drawn. If what people who advocate that the law of contradiction is "unconditionally valid," "universally and absolutely valid" (such as E. Klüger and G. Klaus, see "German Philosophy Journal" fourth issue of 1954, pages 907 and 946) affirm is limited to effectiveness in this sense, then their views are also consistent with Gorsky's views. But they did not distinguish between the effectiveness of the law of contradiction in discussion, in proof, and in the theoretical system, and its effectiveness in general methods of cognition and in application to real objects. This is where the divergence of the two views lies. If we start from the fact that our discussion does not allow logical contradictions and draw the conclusion that the law of contradiction can be used as a principle of the method of cognition in any case, then this goes against the views of Gorsky and others.
    The characteristic of the latter argument is that it recognizes the effectiveness of the law of contradiction in discussion and scientific systems, but it also affirms that its application is conditional and its scope of application is limited. We believe that it is completely correct to distinguish between the limitations of the scope of application of formal logic laws and their role in argumentation. Because since we admit the theoretical premise of materialists: the object exists objectively and can be recognized by us, then the question of applying logical laws to objective objects must arise. This question is different from the question of the correct connection of logical laws to thinking and the significance of argumentation, and must be examined separately.
    In fact, the central issue of the relationship between formal logic and Marxist dialectics is the question of the conditions or scope for which formal logic applies to the real world. To deny this question, to think that this question is meaningless, would violate the principles of materialism. Only talking about the effectiveness and role of logical laws in discussion and proof, without mentioning this question, is only discussing the question of formal logic itself, and has not touched on the question of its relationship with dialectics at all. Therefore, this question must be raised first in the discussion of logical problems. And for this question, there can essentially only be two answers: one believes that logical laws are universally valid, and the other believes that their scope of application is limited.
    In my opinion, the difficulties encountered in the discussion of logical problems are due to the fact that people have not distinguished between formal logic itself and its application, and have not distinguished between the validity of logical laws in argumentation and the conditions of their application to real objects. Often, some people start from the logical laws themselves, and in view of the fact that they constitute the necessary conditions for the correct connection of thinking and are necessarily correct, they infer that they are universally applicable to real objects. This inference is problematic. In addition, some people start from the relationship between logical laws and real objects, and in view of the fact that they are not completely consistent with real laws and their application is conditional, they infer that they themselves are also incorrect and that it is not necessary to abide by logical laws in discussion. This inference is even more unacceptable. The first step in solving logical problems is to distinguish between questions related to formal logic itself and questions about its scope of application. Then, concretely study the conditions of application of each logical law. This research is closely related to the research on the specific content of objective objects, thus going beyond the scope of purely formal logic and entering the field of scientific methods. But this is not surprising at all, the logical problem we are discussing is an important problem in methodology and epistemology.

    介绍苏联和民主德国关于逻辑问题的讨论
    江天骥
    一
    苏联“哲学问题”杂志在1950年和1951年进行关于逻辑问题的讨论。参加这次讨论的文章已由三联书店汇集出版。苏联逻辑问题讨论的情况对于我国广大读者并不是生疏的。
    在1951年11月，民主德国的哲学工作者就在哲学会议上开始了关于逻辑问题的讨论，后来在统一社会党的理论刊物“统一”上，在“德国哲学杂志”上都发表了参加讨论的文章。特别是“德国哲学杂志”从1953年创刊到现在，对于逻辑问题一直在继续讨论之中。我们还没有得到充分的资料，不能作出较全面的介绍和分析。但就我们所读到的某些文章看来，可以断定：在苏联出现的各种有代表性的见解在民主德国也同样出现过。对于形式逻辑与唯物辩证法的关系问题，也有基本上互相对立的两种主张：一种承认有和形式逻辑不同的辩证逻辑；另一种则对辩证逻辑抱怀疑或否定的态度。
    “德国哲学杂志”上的讨论由吴·哈利希发表于1953年第一期的论文开始。哈利希对于恩·霍夫曼发表在前一年“统一”杂志上的文章提出全面的反驳，现在把双方的基本论点简述于后：
    霍夫曼认为形式逻辑的对象是提供了客观真理的思维、思维规律和思维形式。辩证逻辑的对象也是思维及其规律和形式。因此形式逻辑和辩证逻辑的区别“不在于对象的不同，而在于对相同对象所使用的方法有别，而在于认识对象的方法不同”。霍夫曼指出，形式逻辑借助于同一律、矛盾律、排中律和充足理由律来研究它的对象。而“辩证逻辑使用辩证方法，它借助于辩证方法来研究思维及其规律和形式”。
    按照霍夫曼看来，主要的是形式逻辑方法与辩证逻辑方法的区别：“形式逻辑的方法基于四个初步的思维规律的应用。因此形式逻辑只能提供关于实在的初步知识”，而“辩证逻辑的方法基于辩证方法的应用”，所以它能够提供关于实在的充分知识。关于实在的辩证性质的知识只是由于突破了四个初步规律所建立的限制，才能达到的。
    以上就是霍夫曼的基本论点。他在表述自己的主张时所使用的概念是不够确切的，这里指出两点：第一，他说形式逻辑借助于四个思维规律来研究它的对象。这“对象”是指思维形式和规律本身，还是指客观现实的对象呢？如果是指前者，那么形式逻辑便借助于思维规律来研究思维规律了，所以哈利希曾指出这一点来反驳他。但他所谓“对象”也可以指客观实在中的对象，因为他说四个思维规律的应用提供关于实在的初步知识。至少在表述上他没有把形式逻辑这门科学的对象和形式逻辑方法的对象区别开来。其次，他说辩证逻辑的方法基于辩证方法的应用，这个提法也是不确切的。把他的意思确切地表述出来，应该是这样：辩证逻辑方法基于辩证法规律（也是思维规律）的应用；正如形式逻辑的方法基于同一律等等的应用一样。
    但在形式逻辑和辩证逻辑的关系问题上，霍夫曼的主张是很明确的，他认为：（一）形式逻辑也是认识现实对象的方法，而且是和辩证法不同的思想方法；（二）应用同一律等等去认识现实的形式逻辑方法只能提供关于对象的初步知识，必须突破四个初步规律的限制才能获得关于对象的充分知识。
    在这个问题上，哈利希的论点和霍夫曼是直接对立的。他首先提出形式逻辑是否思想方法的问题：四个思维规律的应用能否成为一种思想方法呢？形式逻辑能否提供关于客观实在的知识呢？他的答案是否定的。他说：“形而上学是一个使知识受限制的框框，通过唯物辩证法的应用便被克服了。形式逻辑却不是这样，所以它的规范并不随形而上学的克服而失效。但它自身一般地并不能获致知识，所以就这方面说，它的成就比较形而上学观察现象的狭隘方法本身的成就还要小些。”（“德国哲学杂志”1953年第一期第一百九十四页）因此哈利希认为只有辩证法和形而上学才是认识现象的方法，才是思想方法，形式逻辑却不是思想方法，不能提供知识。其次，哈利希提出“正确的逻辑思维”和辩证认识的关系问题：辩证方法的特征和逻辑思维的规律性是否相矛盾或不能结合呢？他对这一问题的答案也是否定的。他指出，“逻辑思维使同一的词和同一确定的概念联系起来，它断定按照矛盾律可以结合的判断，它由已有的前提得出首尾一贯的结论，它避免推理中的错误，例如四名词、循环论证等等”。按照他的看法，形式逻辑地正确的思维恰恰是辩证知识的逻辑方面，它们两者好像是形式与内容的关系，抽象的逻辑形式和具体的辩证知识是互为前提互相补充的。
    简括起来，哈利希的基本论点如下：（一）形式逻辑不是思想方法，它不能提供任何知识；（二）逻辑思维却构成了辩证知识的一个方面，即辩证知识的逻辑形式方面。因此，哈利希否认辩证法是“高级的”逻辑，否认形式逻辑和辩证法的关系是初级逻辑和高级逻辑的关系。他主张把形式逻辑叫做逻辑，因为“形式”一词似乎是多余的。
    那末，有没有辩证逻辑呢？哈利希认为恩格斯使用“辩证逻辑”一词，所指的是辩证唯物主义关于形式逻辑的理论；列宁使用同一名词所指的是辩证唯物主义的思想方法。辩证唯物主义关于逻辑的理论是在与唯心主义和形而上学进行斗争的过程中形成起来的。它包括以下这些问题：语言与思维的关系；逻辑规律的本质（是存在规律呢还是思维规律）；推理规律的正确性的客观基础；各种判断及推理形式的相互联系；逻辑和心理学、认识论、方法论、语法等等的联系和区别。所有关于这些问题的学说可以总称为“辩证逻辑”。
    哈利希对霍夫曼提出的反驳获得不少参加讨论者的赞同，因此我在上面作了较详细的介绍。例如基本上同意哈利希看法的格·克劳斯说：“我完全相信，使用‘辩证逻辑’这一概念是不必要的，还是叫做马克思主义辩证法好些……逻辑确实是形式的，这里人们必须完全同意保·林克的看法。”（“德国哲学杂志”1954年第四期第九百一十三页；关于保·林克的主张参看同杂志1953年第二期第三百五十七—三百五十八页）。不久以前在“德国哲学杂志”1956年第二期上发表的宝曼关于逻辑问题的文章也有类似的见解。他们都认为逻辑和形式逻辑是相等的，似乎不可能有非形式的逻辑。
    这两种互相对立的主张在逻辑问题的讨论中到处都出现着，在苏联，在民主德国，在我国都可以找到代表。争论似乎很难得到解决。双方争论的关键何在呢？关键在于：人们在按照马克思主义辩证方法去认识现实的过程中所应用的逻辑规律是什么？是形式逻辑的规律呢，还是别的什么思维规律？尽管人们可以像哈利希一样，认为形式逻辑不是思想方法、不能提供关于客观实在的知识，认为辩证逻辑只是马克思主义关于形式逻辑的学说；或者像克劳斯一样，认为逻辑必定是形式的，辩证逻辑这一概念应当废弃不用。但我们所提出的这个关键性问题还是照旧存在着，必须给予答复。对于这一问题的不同答案就把两种互相对立的主张划分开来：一种主张说：人们为要获得关于实在的全面的充分的知识（例如关于对象的辩证发展过程的知识），必须突破形式逻辑规律的限制，如霍夫曼的看法就是这样。另一种主张却认为：思想的真理性或知识的最高标准就在于辩证认识和形式逻辑规律的一致性，如果不按照形式逻辑的规律，辩证方法就不可能获得任何知识。这就是霍夫曼的反对者的看法。
    现在可以把这一关键性的问题这样地表述出来：在承认形式逻辑规律本身的正确性的前提之下，它们对于实在世界的应用（严格地说：把它们应用于认识实在世界）是普遍有效的呢，还是有适用范围的限制？下面我们就把最近苏联某些逻辑学家对于这一问题的解答扼要地加以评述。
    二
    甫·切尔凯索夫这样地提出这个关键性的问题，他说：“以形式逻辑的方法是否能够在意识中反映运动、变化和发展的事实呢？主张形式逻辑具有普遍性质的人对这个问题的答复是肯定的。他们认为，形式逻辑所表述的思维规律和思维形式，用来反映客观世界的任何联系和任何规律性都是绰绰有余的”（“学习译丛”1956年第九期第十八页）。我们如果把问题提得更加具体些，那么对于这样一个问题：“按照甚么逻辑规律去反映运动？”便可能有以下几种不同的答案。
    第一，主张形式逻辑普遍有效的人的看法，以巴克拉节为代表。巴克拉节说：“事物、现象间‘最简单的’和最复杂的关系都服从于辩证法。而在认识一切现象、一切关系时，无论是最简单的或者是最复杂的，思维都要遵守逻辑的规律”（“逻辑问题讨论集”，三联书店版第十页）。从这种看法可以得出：思维是按照逻辑的矛盾律去反映运动的。但这种看法含有一个前提，如果明白说出，就是这样：辩证法规律（例如对立面统一的规律）只是在客观世界中起作用的，形式逻辑规律（例如矛盾律）只是在思维中起作用的。正如列宁所指出的，“那就是说，思维和存在不相联系”（列宁：“哲学笔记”第二百五十八页），思维规律和存在规律是不一致的。这就很难说明为什么思维能够反映存在了。
    第二种看法为了避免第一种的明显的错误，承认必须按照对立面统一的规律去反映运动，但是认为这种反映也必须符合形式逻辑的矛盾律，否则就是不正确的。持这种看法的人可以承认对立面统一的规律在认识上的作用，但他们又认为，这个规律只是思想方法的原则，它必须和形式逻辑的矛盾律结合起来，正如内容与形式的互相结合一样。这种看法在苏联、波兰、民主德国和我国都可以找到代表，上面所介绍的哈利希的观点属于这个类型。波兰哲学家阿·莎夫也有类似的看法，莎夫说：“……只有估计到逻辑的矛盾律，我们才可能理解辩证的变化和发展的观点，才可能自觉地谈到这种观点”（“学习译丛”1956年第十一期第四十四页）。但是这种看法对于思想方法和逻辑的关系是不明确的，它只是断定形式逻辑和辩证方法可以结合，却并不能够说明和解决两者的关系问题。
    第二种看法和第一种看法实质上是相同的，它肯定了形式逻辑规律的普遍有效性，不过同时也不否认辩证法规律在认识上的作用。所以实质上相同，因为这种看法同样引导到逻辑形式和认识内容的不一致。事实上持第一种看法的人较少，主张形式逻辑普遍有效的人大都采取第二种看法。
    第三种看法和承认形式逻辑的普遍有效性的看法是直接对立的。以甫·切尔凯索夫、莫·阿列克谢也夫和德·高尔斯基等人为代表。切尔凯索夫首先肯定：“我们能够用思想把运动和发展按照它们的本来面貌反映出来”，其次，“只有在运用对立面的统一的规律的基础上，才能这样反映运动”（“学习译丛”1956年第九期第十九页）。阿列克谢也夫在批评上文所引莎夫的论点时指出：“把解释辩证的运动过程归结为逻辑的非矛盾律，就意味着拒绝对运动作科学的解释”。他说：“对立面的统一和斗争的辩证规律的内容同形式逻辑的非矛盾律的内容是完全不同的。……逻辑的非矛盾律本身决不能解释辩证的矛盾。要借助于这一规律来理解辩证的矛盾是不可能的，而要借助于它来论证这一矛盾则更是不可能”（“学习译丛”1956年第十一期第四十五页）。但是对这个关键问题给予最明确具体的答复的，要推苏联科学院1956年新编“逻辑”的主编者之一高尔斯基。他说：“尽管形式逻辑规律的适用范围是非常宽广的，……然而这些规律在一定条件下就会失掉自己的效力（例如当我们不能撇开被研究的对象的发展和变化时）。”举个具体的例，“运动是间断的又非间断的”这个判断，就内容方面看是真实的，就形式方面看是矛盾的，而“从用来分析我们的思想的形式逻辑来看，一切在形式上矛盾的思想都必然是错误的。在这样一些地方，形式逻辑的方法就失掉了效力，因而在这种时候，我们必须就思想的具体内容的实质来分析思想。而分析这种判断内容的实质，我们就可以不管这一判断的形式如何，而把它当作真的来处理”（苏联科学院1956年新编“逻辑”第一章，译文根据北京大学逻辑教研室所译，下同）。这就是说，按照形式逻辑规律看来是错误的思想，按照具体内容可以是真实的，这时形式逻辑的规律就失效，须要让位于辩证法的规律，这就说明形式逻辑的局限性。高尔斯基在这里赶紧声明：“形式逻辑规律这种适用范围的局限性……，决不能理解为，例如，当我们谈论运动、发展着的对象时，可以自相矛盾”（同上书第一章，着重点是引用者加的）。尽管作了这个声明，在研究形式逻辑的人看来，矛盾律可以失效的说法总是违反常识的，甚至是有害的、危险的思想。
    所以在马克思主义者中间，对于这个提得很尖锐的问题：“逻辑的矛盾律（或叫做非矛盾律）是否适用于反映运动？”实质上有两种不同的看法：有些人坚决认为在任何地方都必须保持矛盾律的效力，这种看法和常识是一致的，容易为大家所接受。另一些人认为在反映运动时矛盾律是不适用的，但是在议论中却不容许自相矛盾。双方争论的症结何在呢？
    形式逻辑的矛盾律禁止我们在同一时间同一关系中对同一对象断定互相排斥的属性。如果矛盾律是普遍有效的，那么，“运动的物体在一定的点上又不在一定的点上”这个判断便是错误的。为了不违反矛盾律，必须把这种判断解释成：互相排斥的属性是在不同的时间或不同的关系中属于同一对象的。的确在我们的抽象思维中，任何时候都可以应用这样的分析方法，把含有互相排斥的属性的同一对象分成彼此分离的两个方面或两个对象，这样我们就得到两个互不矛盾的判断：某事物一方面是这样，另一方面不是这样。从这种观点出发，波兰学者伏·罗尔别茨基就认为，“借助于形式逻辑，可以把客观世界的矛盾毫无矛盾地反映到思维中来，在最高的综合中，可以‘消除’现实某一片断的最初的辩证形态中所存在的矛盾”（参看“学习译丛”1956年第九期第十五页）。这种分析方法，固然保持了矛盾律的效力，但是统一体中两个互相依存又互相排斥的对立面却被分解成两个独立的方面，事物内部的活生生的矛盾也就消失了。须知这种排除内在矛盾的方法，不是别的，恰恰是恩格斯所指摘的形而上学方法。恩格斯说：“当我们把事物看作是静止的，没有生命的各个单独的、相互并列的，或先后相继的时候，我们在事物中自然会碰不到什么矛盾。我们在这里看到一定的属性，这些属性，一部分是相同的，一部分是相异的，或甚至是相互矛盾的，可是在后一个场合下它们是分别存在于不同事物之中的，所以它们内部并不包含任何矛盾。在我们的观察限于这种范围的时候，我们用通常的形而上学的思想方法也就行了。可是当我们从事物的运动、变化、生命和相互作用方面去观察事物时，那么情形就完全不同了”（“反杜林论”中文版第一百二十三页）。恩格斯接着就说出那个关于运动着的物体的判断。这个判断在形式上是违反矛盾律的，可是它却反映着运动本身的矛盾。
    由此可见：如果认为矛盾律是无条件地可以适用的，把它看做认识方法的普遍有效的原则，应用它来分析具体矛盾，就会排除了事物的内在矛盾，排除了辩证法的思想方法，尽管这是违反我们的初衷的。
    问题既然提得很明确，不同主张的后果就都可以看出来了。排除辩证方法是不能容许的，这是主张形式逻辑普遍有效的马克思主义者所面临的不可克服的困难。那末，矛盾律可以失效的说法又会引导到什么后果呢？是否意味着：可以容许议论中的自相矛盾？反对这种说法的马克思主义者也许是这样想的，但高尔斯基等人却不这样想。争论的症结就在这里。我们试看看以高尔斯基为代表的这种主张。
    高尔斯基认为形式逻辑规律的适用范围是有限制的，但是我们在任何议论中都要遵守这些规律。例如在认识物体的运动时矛盾律是无效的，但是我们在议论中却不容许自相矛盾。他说：“在任何论断或任何科学体系中都不应有形式的矛盾。这些矛盾会破坏体系”（“逻辑”第十六章）。如何理解他的看法呢？
    有些人强调形式逻辑规律、特别是矛盾律在科学理论中的效力。例如波兰哲学家莎夫在他的名著“马克思主义真理论的几个问题”中指出：“按照马克思主义经典作家的看法，逻辑矛盾意义下的矛盾在系统中是不能容许的。因此，如果从一个论断中能够推出自相矛盾的结论来（就是说两个判断，其中一个否定另一个所肯定的东西），这个论断就是假的。从马克思主义经典作家的言论中可以清楚地看到，他们认为一个系统的不正确性就在于证明它的逻辑矛盾”（德文版第一百一十一页，着重点是引用者加的）。莎夫这些话无疑是正确的，他所谈的是矛盾律在证明中的效力，在理论体系中的作用，这也是高尔斯基所强调的。我们大家都同意，任何矛盾的发现就是科学体系的破坏，在证明过程中，如果容许两个互相矛盾的判断，那末甚么结论就都可以得出来。主张矛盾律“无条件地有效”、“普遍和绝对地有效”的人们（例如爱·克吕格和格·克劳斯，参看“德国哲学杂志”1954年第四期第九百零七页和九百四十六页。）所断定的如果限于在这种意义下的有效性，那么他们的看法和高尔斯基的看法也是一致的。但是他们并没有把矛盾律在议论中、在证明中及在理论体系中的效力，和它在一般认识方法上、在应用于现实对象上的效力区别开来。这就是两种看法的分歧所在。如果从我们的议论不容许有逻辑矛盾出发，作出结论：矛盾律在任何场合下都可以作为认识方法的原则，这就和高尔斯基等人的主张背道而驰了。
    后一种主张的特点在于既承认矛盾律在议论和科学体系中的效力，却又断定它的应用是有条件的，它的适用范围是有限制的。我们觉得，把形式逻辑规律适用范围的局限性和它们在论证中的作用区别开来是完全正确的。因为既然承认唯物主义者的理论前提：对象是客观存在的又是能够为我们所认识的，那末就必定产生把逻辑规律应用于客观对象的问题。这个问题和逻辑规律对于思维正确联系、对于论证的意义问题是不同的，必须分别考察。
    事实上，形式逻辑和马克思主义辩证法的关系问题的中心问题，就是形式逻辑适用于实在世界的条件或范围问题。否认这个问题，认为这个问题没有意义，便会违背唯物主义的原则。只谈论逻辑规律在议论、证明中的效力和作用，不提这个问题，那就只是讨论形式逻辑本身的问题，还完全没有触及它与辩证法的关系问题。所以在逻辑问题讨论中首先必须提出这个问题。而对于这个问题实质上只能够有两种答案：一种认为逻辑规律是普遍有效的，另一种认为它们的适用范围是有限制的。
    依我看，逻辑问题讨论中所遇到的困难，由于人们没有把形式逻辑本身和它的应用区别开来，没有把逻辑规律在论证中的有效性和它们对于现实对象的适用条件区别开来。往往有人从逻辑规律本身着眼，鉴于它们构成思维正确联系的必要条件，是必然正确的，因而推论到它们对于现实对象也是普遍适用的。这种推论是有问题的。另外也有人从逻辑规律和现实对象的关系着眼，鉴于它们和现实规律是不完全一致的，它们的应用是有条件的，因而推论到它们本身也是不正确的，在议论中是不必遵守逻辑规律的。这种推论更是不能容许的。解决逻辑问题的第一步就是要把有关形式逻辑本身的问题同它的适用范围问题区别开来。然后具体研究每一个逻辑规律的适用条件。这种研究是与对客观对象的具体内容的研究密切相联地进行的，因此超出了纯粹的形式逻辑的范围，而进入了科学方法的领域。但这是一点也不足为奇的，我们所讨论的这个逻辑问题乃是方法论和认识论上的一个重要问题。
