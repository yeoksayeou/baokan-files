    Sichuan Province Strives for Eighth Year of Bumper Harvest

    (Our report) Sichuan is striving to achieve its eighth bumper harvest year since liberation this year. On both sides of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, the western Sichuan Plain, and the Aba, Ganzi, and Liangshan Autonomous Prefectures are stepping up preparations for spring plowing according to local seasonal conditions. Farmers in some areas of the Yibin, Luzhou, and Xichang Special Zones have already begun spring plowing.

    This year, the province plans to increase grain production by 7% on the basis of last year's agricultural production increase, with a total output reaching 46.7 billion jin. Production plans for cotton, rapeseed, and sugarcane are all higher than last year. In order to achieve the above agricultural production increase plan, various means of production have been prepared as early as possible. The Provincial Department of Agriculture alone has raised more than 130 million jin of early and late rice varieties. The province already has more than 300,000 tons of various commercial fertilizers. In order to increase fertilizer, counties throughout the province have launched a widespread movement to accumulate and produce fertilizer after the Spring Festival.

    Currently, local prefectural and county Party committees are also successively dispatching large numbers of cadres to the countryside to assist agricultural cooperatives in preparing for spring plowing.

    At present, the major problems in spring plowing preparation are: after the autumn harvest last year, various localities successively focused on other central tasks in rural areas, so some places relaxed water conservancy construction, water storage, and water conservation. If effective measures are not taken in time, it is estimated that about 11% of the province's fields will not be fully planted. The Provincial People's Committee has issued instructions requiring all localities to pay attention to solving this problem. All localities are stepping up the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects and repairing ponds. Responsible comrades from special zones such as Jiangjin and Da County have personally gone down to guide the work. Secondly, the leadership strength of a few county Party committees has not yet caught up, and some weak links have appeared in the preparation for spring plowing. For example, the slack mood among some farmers, especially township and commune cadres, has not been completely eliminated. Before and after the Spring Festival, various localities conducted large-scale publicity to farmers about increasing production and practicing economy, as well as achievements in establishing cooperatives and increasing production. However, according to estimates from the Jiangjin, Leshan, and Neijiang special zones, about 20% of agricultural cooperatives are not very motivated. Some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the early start of this year's spring production and the increase in the multiple cropping index, and they are not prepared enough. Therefore, some agricultural cooperatives have not yet prepared fertilizer, draft cattle, and production funds. All localities are solving the above problems through checking the preparation for spring plowing, which has achieved great results. For example, since the Emei County Party Committee checked the preparation for spring plowing, it has mobilized collective farmers throughout the county to accumulate more than 10 million jin of various natural fertilizers; invested 120,000 yuan; and actively sought water sources for 14,000 mu of water-deficient fields. The Shengli and other three townships, which lack draft cattle, have rented 150 draft cattle from nearby townships. It is expected that various localities can basically eliminate the various weak links in the preparation for spring plowing before the spring plowing begins.

### 四川省争取第八个丰收年

    四川省争取第八个丰收年
    本报讯　四川今年争取实现解放后的第八个丰收年。在长江、嘉陵江两岸，川西平原，以及阿坝、甘孜、凉山自治州正根据当地季节情况，加紧春耕准备。宜宾、泸州、西昌三个专区的部分地区的农民已经开始了春耕。
    今年全省计划在去年农业增产的基础上，再增产粮食7％，总产量达到四百六十七亿斤。棉花、油菜、甘蔗的生产计划都高过去年。为了实现上述农业增产计划，各种生产资料都及早作了准备。单是省农业厅已筹集了早、晚稻良种一亿三千多万斤。全省已有各种商品肥料三十多万吨。各县为了增加肥料，在春节以后普遍掀起了积肥、造肥运动。
    现在，各地委、县委还陆续抽调大批干部下乡，协助农业社做好各项春耕准备。
    目前，备耕中问题较大的是：去年秋收以后，各地接连抓紧其他农村中心工作，因此有部分地方放松了兴修水利，蓄水保水。要不及时采取有效措施，估计全省约有11％的田不能满插满栽。省人民委员会已经发出指示要求各地重视解决这一问题。各地正抓紧兴修小型水利，整修堰塘。江津、达县等专区的负责同志亲自下去指导。其次，少数县委的领导力量还没有赶上去，在备耕中出现一些薄弱环节。如部分农民，特别是乡、社干部中的松劲情绪还没有完全消除。春节前后，各地向农民大规模地宣传了增产节约和建社、增产成绩。但是，据江津、乐山、内江三个专区估计，约有20％农业社的干劲不大。有些干部对今年大春生产提早、复种指数提高这一点认识不足，准备不够。因此，有些农业社的肥料、耕牛以及生产资金还没有准备好。各地正通过检查备耕情况，对上述问题加以解决，收效较大。例如中共峨眉县委在检查备耕以来，又发动全县集体农民积了各种自然肥一千多万斤；投资十二万元；积极为一万四千亩缺水田寻找水源。缺少耕牛的胜利等三个乡，又从附近各乡租来耕牛一百五十头。预计各地在春耕前就可以基本上消除备耕中的各个薄弱环节。
