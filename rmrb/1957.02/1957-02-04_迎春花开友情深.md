　　Welcoming Spring Flowers Bloom with Deep Friendship Xu Fang
　　On the second day of the Spring Festival, the north wind outside the window was still a bit chilly, and the snow on the roadside had not yet melted; but when people stepped into this sunny apartment, they immediately smelled the breath of spring. Winter jasmine blossomed, and the pale yellow four-season osmanthus in the house exuded a rich fragrance, and the red crabapple flowers looked even more delicate. Soviet experts walking towards us greeted their Chinese friends with kind smiles, making people feel that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union was as warm as spring. Dozens of Soviet experts who are helping our country build Anshan Iron and Steel Company live here. These experts have spent countless nights and immeasurable energy for the construction and production of Anshan Iron and Steel. Today—on our happy holiday, the experts are also singing and dancing with the leaders, engineers, technicians, and workers of Anshan Iron and Steel to welcome a new spring.
　　At three o'clock in the afternoon, the small banquet held by the comrades of the Electrical Installation Engineering Company and the experts had just ended, and the reporter followed the manager Sun Zhaosen, Guo Yingchen, and technicians to the experts' bedrooms. The lark in the cage on the eaves chirped crisply like a song, as if warmly welcoming Chinese friends with its master. The host Shevchenko and his wife Gorki Shevchenko warmly entertained everyone. After the chat began, Manager Guo told the reporter with gratitude about an unforgettable assistance from the expert. He said: In order to complete the construction of a large steel rolling mill two months ahead of schedule, we encountered a difficult problem—the lack of three control panels and two other signal signs on the main drive motor. Without them, these huge machines would not be able to turn, and the construction period would be delayed. This is the key to determining whether the factory can start production. What to do? Some people proposed to ask the Soviet Union to transport these parts to us by plane, but it would also take a long time. At this critical moment, Shevchenko proposed to design it himself. In order to save time, his wife Gorki Shevchenko also participated in the design work. After seven consecutive days and nights, they finally solved this key problem and saved time. Speaking of this, Shevchenko smiled modestly and said: Nothing can be done by one person alone. When we build, it is like being on the battlefield. One person cannot win a battle. Our little contribution is also achieved together with Chinese comrades. When people's eyes turned to Gorki Shevchenko, she smiled and said that my little help is like a drop of water in the sea. At this time, the photojournalist captured the humble smiles of this Soviet couple in the lens.
　　I followed the managers to the rooms of Borisov and Ivanov. They were very hospitable. The 59-year-old expert Ivanov chatted with everyone while treating guests with wine, fruits, and sugar. An engineer who specially followed this expert to study told the reporter that when installing the protective box in the new sintering plant, it suddenly malfunctioned. This elderly Soviet man climbed onto a building more than 50 meters high to guide Chinese technicians. Others were afraid that he would be tired from walking, but he said, "I am the same as you young people." Expert Ivanov has used his more than 30 years of experience in telecommunications to train many new talents for us.
　　At this time, Borisov's room was also crowded with people. They were talking and laughing, talking about work and life. Borisov is a very cheerful person, always smiling gently. When Manager Sun talked about how he helped the Electrical Installation Engineering Company improve technical management and came up with various ways to save a large amount of steel, he said, "Don't praise me. Ninety-nine percent of the achievements belong to Chinese comrades. I only have one percent of the credit." His humble and amiable eyes really made people feel that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union was so deep.
　　When I said goodbye to these experts and walked into the living room, I only heard a burst of laughter. It turned out that the party between the directors of the steel rolling mill and the steel rolling expert Turupov had not yet ended. Today, some experts and their wives went ice skating, and those who liked the game of throwing wooden sticks enthusiastically engaged in a fierce competition; experts who liked quietness were playing billiards in the club, and some experts and their wives went to Chinese friends' homes as guests.
　　The people from the design institute were especially happy today. At the party they held, young people and experts danced and set off firecrackers together.
　　The first night of the Spring Festival was also a very lively night. Anshan Iron and Steel's managers, factory directors, and model workers celebrated our national festival with Soviet experts. Soviet expert Filechkin, who was helping the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant with the renovation project, found Zeng Yangqing, the director of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, and congratulated him on the fact that the steelworkers had created a new monthly production record in the first month of this year. Coincidentally, sitting next to Director Zeng were Zhou Xuancheng and Ding Weijian, the two deputy deans of the Anshan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute. Expert Filechkin said to the two deputy deans Zhou and Ding: "I hope you designers will help the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant design and transform it into the best steelmaking plant." Because expert Filechkin already knew that Vice Dean Ding was Director Zeng's wife, he smiled humorously at Vice Dean Ding and said: "You should help the steelmaking plant even more, both helping the country increase steel production and helping your husband." These words made everyone laugh.
　　In the downstairs recreation room, Director Li Wen of the large steel rolling mill played billiards with the experts, and the dance on the third floor was in full swing.
　　It was late at night, and a picture hanging in front of the apartment depicting Moscow, Beijing, and Anshan looked very magnificent under the dazzling lights, symbolizing that the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, which is building our motherland, cannot be separated from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union.

    迎春花开友情深	徐放
    春节第二天，窗外的北风还有些寒峭，道旁的积雪还未溶化；可是当人们踏进这座充满阳光的公寓时，立即闻到了春天的气息。迎春花开了，屋子里淡黄色的四季桂散发着浓郁的芳香，红色的海棠花也更加显得娇艳。迎面走来的苏联专家们带着和悦的笑容正和中国朋友们相互问好，在这里使人感到中苏友情像春天一般温暖。就在这儿正住着几十位帮助我们祖国建设鞍钢的苏联专家。这些专家们为着鞍钢的建设和生产，曾经熬过了多少夜晚，花费了无法计算的精力。今天——在我们愉快的节日里，专家们也和鞍钢的领导人员、工程技术人员和工人们一同唱着、舞着，迎接一个新的春天。
    下午三点钟，电气安装工程公司的同志和专家们一起举行的小型欢宴刚刚结束，记者随着经理孙照森、郭英忱和技术员们一起来到了专家的寝室。窗檐上笼子里的云雀歌唱似的发出清脆的叫声，好像也和主人一起热情地迎接中国友人。主人舍夫琴柯和他的爱人高尔基舍夫琴娜热情地招待着大家，闲谈开始后，郭经理用感激的口吻向记者叙述了专家的一次难忘的援助。他说：为了提前二个月要建成一座大型轧钢厂的工程，可是遇到了一个难以解决的问题——缺少主传动马达上的三个操作盘和另外两个信号牌，没有了它，这些巨大的机器就转不起来，工期就要延缓。这就是决定工厂能否开工生产的关键。怎么办？有人提出请求苏联用飞机给我们运送这些机件，但是也需要较长的时间。在这紧张关头，舍夫琴柯提出由他来设计，为了争取时间，他的爱人高尔基舍夫琴娜也参加了设计工作，他们经过连续七个白天和黑夜，终于把这个关键打开了，时间争取到了。郭经理讲到这儿，舍夫琴柯谦逊地笑着说：单靠一个人什么事情也干不出来，我们建设的时候正如在战场上一样，一个人是不能打胜仗的，我们的一点贡献也是和中国同志一起取得的。当人们的眼光转向高尔基舍夫琴娜的时候，她笑了笑说，我的一点帮助只像大海中浍上一滴水一样。这时摄影记者把这一对苏联人谦虚的笑容摄入了镜头。
    我随着经理们来到包利索夫和伊万诺夫的房间。他们十分热情好客，五十九岁的伊万诺夫专家一边和大家谈笑着，一边用葡萄酒、水果和糖来招待客人。一位专门跟随这位专家学习的工程师告诉记者，在建设新烧结厂的时候，安装的保护箱突然出了毛病，这位年迈的苏联人，就爬上五十多公尺高的建筑物上去指导中国技术人员。别人怕他走累了，他说，我和你们年青人一样。伊万诺夫专家用他三十多年的电讯工作经验，为我们培养了不少新的人材。
    这时，在包利索夫专家的屋子里，也挤满了人。他们正在谈笑着、谈着工作、谈着生活。包利索夫是一个十分愉快的人，总是温和地笑着，当孙经理讲到他帮助电气安装工程公司改进技术管理和想出各种办法节约了大批钢材时，他说，不要表扬我，百分之九十九的成绩是中国同志的，我呢，只有百分之一的功劳。他那谦虚和蔼的眼光，真使人感到中苏之间的友情是那么深厚。
    当我告别了这几位专家，走进客厅的时候，只听得一阵谈笑声，原来这里是轧钢厂的厂长们正和轧钢专家图鲁波夫的联欢还未结束。今天，有的专家和他的爱人溜冰去了，喜欢掷木棍游戏的兴高采烈地进行了一场激烈的比赛；喜爱安静的专家正在俱乐部里打弹子，还有的专家和他的爱人一起到中国朋友家去作客。
    设计院的人今天特别高兴，在他们举办的联欢会上，年轻人和专家一起跳舞，一起放爆竹。
    春节第一个晚上，也是一个十分热闹的夜晚。鞍钢的经理、厂长和劳动模范等和苏联专家在一起欢度了我们民族的节日。正在帮助第一炼钢厂进行改建工程的苏联专家菲列奇肯，找到了第一炼钢厂厂长曾扬清，向他祝贺在今年的第一个月炼钢工人们又创造了月产量的最高新记录，恰好坐在曾厂长旁边的正是黑色冶金设计院鞍山分院的周宣城、丁惟坚两位副院长，菲列奇肯专家就对周、丁两位副院长说：希望你们设计人员帮助第一炼钢厂设计改造成为最好的炼钢厂。因为菲列奇肯专家已经知道丁副院长是曾厂长的爱人，他很有风趣地笑着对丁副院长说：你更应该帮助炼钢厂了，既帮助国家增产了钢，又帮助了自己的丈夫。这一席话引得大家哈哈大笑起来。
    在楼下娱乐室里，大型轧钢厂厂长李文和专家们一起打弹子，三楼的舞兴正浓。
    夜深了，高挂在公寓前面的一幅绘着莫斯科、北京和鞍钢的图案，在那耀眼的灯光下显得十分雄伟，象征着建设我们祖国的鞍钢是离不开苏联无私的援助的。
