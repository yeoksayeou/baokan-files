Ensure a Good Supply of Agricultural Production Materials

Spring plowing is about to begin in rural areas of most provinces in our country. In order to strive for a bumper harvest this year, all localities must work hard to ensure a good supply of agricultural production materials.

The supply of production materials is important for the development of agricultural production at all times. Agricultural production in our country has been collectivized, and the supply of production materials is even more important. This is because the purchasing power of agricultural cooperatives, as collective production units, is much greater than the sum of the purchasing power of all its members when they were operating individually. Currently, the demand for high-quality and new agricultural production materials has greatly increased. Whether this demand can be well met is closely related to whether agriculture can rapidly increase production.

In order to appropriately guarantee the needs of agricultural production, the national supply and marketing system has currently prepared more than 1.6 million new farm tools and various iron waterwheels, more than 90,000 various large-scale farm implements, and more than 60,000 horsepower of power machinery. As of the end of January, various localities had prepared more than 530,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, more than 187,000 tons of chemical pesticides, and more than 1.54 million sets of pesticide equipment. Most of these materials have been allocated to county and grassroots cooperatives. In addition, the agricultural and grain departments have also stored large quantities of various improved seeds.

However, having these production materials does not mean that the supply work is well done. This is because we must promote these production materials according to the needs of various localities; at the same time, it is not enough to simply promote the production materials, but to ensure that these materials can play a practical role in production. For example, last year the national supply and marketing cooperative system supplied 1.5 million double-wheeled double (single) plowshares, but because the planning and supply departments were very blind in formulating sales plans, many of those sold did not play a role. This not only tied up the state's valuable funds and raw materials, but also caused complaints from many agricultural cooperatives. This is a problem that must be paid close attention to in this year's agricultural production materials supply work.

This year, we must especially emphasize doing a good job in investigation and research, so that the supply plan of production materials can conform to the actual situation and the different needs of different regions. Taking new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery as an example, we need to investigate the use of various new-style farm tools and agricultural machinery through key experimental methods, analyze their usage conditions, and determine which farm tools and agricultural machinery to promote according to the soil properties, the strength of draft animals, and the farming habits of different regions; it is also necessary to determine the number of farm tools and agricultural machinery to be promoted according to the purchasing power of agricultural cooperatives, the actual needs for production materials, and the staffing of technical personnel. The practice of simply dividing the number of cultivated acres by the annual working capacity of a certain farm tool or agricultural machinery to arrive at a supply plan, without considering the specific situation and conditions, is completely wrong. In addition, some regions, when formulating plans to promote large-scale farm tools, did not base them on the actual needs of the local area, but simply made promotional plans because certain large-scale farm tools were stored in warehouses. This practice should also be prevented and corrected.

The supply of agricultural production materials should be combined with technical guidance work. Although some new-style farm tools are suitable for promotion in some areas, farmers cannot use them even if they want to because the technical guidance work does not keep up. Especially for chemical pesticides, the varieties, specifications, and quality are very complex, and it is difficult to promote and apply them without technical guidance; improper use of highly toxic pesticides can cause casualties to humans and animals, and farmers dare not use them even more without technical guidance. When supplying certain large-scale farm tools, if farmers are not given technical education, it often leads to losses. For example, the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, used a seeder to sow corn, but because they did not know how to calculate the sowing amount and width, all the corn sown was wasted; 38 farmers in six townships in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, injured their fingers when using threshing machines, and as a result, farmers were unwilling to use them again. In the past few years, especially last year, although the agricultural departments trained and cultivated more than 2 million technicians in promoting technology, the number and experience of this technical team cannot match the scale of the supply work, and it is still necessary to train a large number of technicians step by step, and actively improve the technical level of the original technicians, so that they can skillfully use, disassemble, install, and carry out simple repairs of new farm tools and agricultural machinery. In short, various localities have accumulated many effective experiences in technology promotion, and they should be summarized and applied in a timely manner.

Due to the further development of the cooperative movement and the continuous expansion of agricultural production, agricultural cooperatives still need a considerable number of various large-scale new-style farm tools this year. For agricultural cooperatives that truly need them and have the purchasing power and conditions for use, supply and marketing cooperatives should actively supply them on a voluntary principle of cash transactions. It is not good for some supply and marketing cooperatives to take a passive waiting attitude because they are afraid of stockpiling. For farm tools and agricultural machinery that have been supplied to agricultural cooperatives but have not yet been used, the reasons why they cannot be used should be found out: if it is due to improper use of technology, technical guidance should be strengthened; if it is due to the wrong model and can be solved through inter-regional adjustment, it should be solved through inter-regional adjustment; for those that can still be used after simple modification and repair, active efforts should be made to modify and repair them. Only in this way can the maximum use be made of the farm tools that have been promoted but not yet used.

Since last winter and this spring, many places across the country have had little rain and snow, showing varying degrees of drought. The supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas should first do a good job in supplying water-lifting tools (power water-lifting tools and waterwheels, etc.) during the spring plowing period, to ensure that these areas can smoothly carry out the drought resistance struggle and sow in a timely manner. The operation of old-style farm tools and small farm tools should not be neglected either. Supply and marketing cooperatives should actively organize local handicraft production cooperatives to manufacture them, in order to meet the needs of local farmers. Although the supply of chemical fertilizers is more abundant this year than last year, it is still far from meeting the actual needs. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on supplying the most needed areas, such as technical crop areas and major grain-producing areas. The current solution to the shortage of commercial fertilizers should be to actively organize various local miscellaneous fertilizers. Local miscellaneous fertilizers have a wide variety and abundant sources, can be processed and sold locally, and are relatively cheap, which are very popular among farmers.

Last year, in the manufacture of various new-style farm tools, agricultural machinery, and chemical pesticides, thanks to the efforts of the vast number of employees and the strict implementation of the product inspection system, the quality of the products was generally guaranteed; in allocation and transportation, the transportation departments also provided great support, providing great convenience for the supply of production materials. Other relevant departments have also given great help to the supply of agricultural production materials. These are the guarantees for the achievements made in the supply work last year. This year, all relevant departments are still required to cooperate and effectively ensure that the current supply of spring plowing production materials is well done.

### 好好供应农业生产资料

    好好供应农业生产资料
    我国多数省份的农村即将开始春耕。为了争取今年农业大丰收，各地都要努力做好农业生产资料的供应工作。
    生产资料的供应对于农业生产的发展，在任何时候都是重要的。我国农业生产已经合作化，生产资料的供应工作就更加重要了。因为农业合作社这个集体生产单位的购买力，比它所有社员在个体经营的时候的购买力总和要大得多。现在农业方面对于质量高的和新的生产资料的需求大大增加了。能否很好地满足这种需求，对于农业能否迅速增产有着十分密切的关系。
    为了适当保证农业生产的需要，全国供销系统目前已经备妥一百六十多万部新农具和各种铁制水车，九万多部各种大型农具和六万多匹马力的动力机器。截至一月底，各地已经准备了化学肥料五十三万多吨，化学农药十八万七千多吨，农药器械一百五十四万多架。这些物资大部分已经调拨到县社和基层社。此外，农业和粮食部门还大量地储备了各种优良种籽。
    但是，有了这些生产资料并不等于供应工作就做好了。因为我们还要根据各地需要的情况，把这些生产资料推销出去；同时，也并不是单纯地把生产资料推销出去就算完事，而是要使这些物资能够在生产中切实发挥作用。举例来说，去年全国供销合作社系统供应了一百五十万部双轮双（单）铧犁，但是由于计划和供应部门在制定推销计划的时候，盲目性很大，结果有不少卖出去的没有发挥作用。这不但积压了国家宝贵的资金和原料，而且也引起了不少农业社的怨言。这是今年农业生产资料供应工作中必须很好注意的一个问题。
    今年必须特别强调做好调查研究工作，使生产资料的供应计划能够符合实际情况和不同地区的不同需要。拿新式农具和农械来说，我们就需要通过重点试验的方法，调查各种新式农具和农械的使用情况，分析它们的使用条件，根据不同地区土壤的性质、耕畜体力的强弱，以及耕作的习惯，确定推广哪种农具和农械；还要根据农业社购买力的情况和对于生产资料的实际需要，以及技术人员配备的情况，来确定推广农具和农械的数字。那种不看具体情况和条件，简单地用某种农具或农械的一年工作能力来除耕地亩数而得出供应计划的作法，是完全不对的。另外有一些地区在制定推销大型农具计划的时候，并不是根据当地的实际需要，而是因为有某些大型农具放在仓库里，就随便作了推销计划。这种作法也应当防止和纠正。
    供应农业生产资料要同技术指导工作结合起来。有些新式农具虽然适宜于在某些地区推广，但因技术指导工作跟不上去，农民想使用也无法使用。特别是化学农药，品种规格质量很复杂，没有技术指导是很难推广应用的；毒性较烈的农药，使用不当就会造成人畜伤亡事故，没有技术指导，农民更是不敢使用。供应某些大型农具的时候，如果不对农民进行技术教育，往往会造成损失。比如，江苏东海县黎明农业社用播种机播种玉米，因为不会计算播种量和宽幅，结果种下的玉米全部作废；浙江余姚县的六个乡有三十八个农民在使用打稻机的时候轧伤了手指，结果农民就不愿再使用。几年来，特别是去年，虽然农业部门在推广技术方面曾经训练和培养了二百多万技术手，但是这个技术队伍的人数和经验还不能和供应工作的规模相适应，仍然需要有步骤地大量训练技术人员，并且积极提高原有技术手的技术水平，使他们对于新的农具和农械能够熟练地使用、拆卸、安装和进行简单的修理。总之各地在技术推广方面已经有不少行之有效的好经验，应该及时进行总结，推广应用。
    由于合作化运动的进一步发展，农业生产的不断扩大，农业社今年仍然需要相当数量的各种大型新式农具。对于真正需要而又有购买能力和使用条件的农业社，供销社应该在自愿的原则下实行现款交易，积极供应。有些供销社因为害怕积压而采取消极等待的态度，是不好的。对于已经供应到农业社但尚未使用起来的农具农械，应该找出不能使用的原因：属于使用技术不当的，要加强技术指导；属于型号不对而通过地区间调剂可以解决的，则通过地区间的调剂来解决；对于经过简单的改装和修理以后仍然能够使用的，应当积极设法进行改装和修理。这样才能够把已经推销出去而尚未使用的农具最大限度地使用起来。
    去冬今春全国不少地方雨雪稀少，呈现不同程度的旱象。这些地区的供销社还应该首先做好春耕期间提水工具（动力提水工具和水车等）的供应，以保证这些地区能够顺利地进行抗旱斗争，适时播种。对于旧式农具和小农具的经营，也不能忽视。供销社应该积极组织当地手工业生产合作社进行制造，以满足当地农民的需求。今年化学肥料的货源虽然比去年多一些，但距离实际需要仍然很远，因此，必须有重点地供给最需要的地区，如技术作物区和主要产粮区。目前解决商品肥料不足的办法应该是积极地组织地方性的各种杂肥。地方杂肥品种繁多而且来源丰富，可以就地加工，就地销售，成本也比较便宜，很受农民欢迎。
    去年在各种新式农具、农械和化学农药制造方面，由于广大职工的努力和严格执行了产品检验制度，产品一般都保证了质量；在调拨运输上，各运输部门也给予很大支持，对生产资料的供应提供了很大的便利。其它有关部门对于农业生产资料的供应工作，也都给了很大的帮助。这些都是去年供应工作取得成绩的保证。今年仍然要求各有关部门分工协作，切实保证把当前春耕生产资料供应工作做好。
