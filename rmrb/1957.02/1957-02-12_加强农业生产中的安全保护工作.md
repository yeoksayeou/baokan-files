    Strengthen Safety Protection in Agricultural Production
    Since the realization of agricultural cooperativization in the Jinzhou area of Liaoning Province, while farmers' enthusiasm for labor has soared and production has achieved unprecedented harvests, many places have also experienced some personal injury and death accidents.

    Among the casualties, accidents in farmland capital construction, injuries and deaths involving vehicles and horses, and miscarriages and hematemesis in women due to overwork are the most frequent. This situation has already caused great losses to agricultural production cooperatives in terms of production, economy, and the lives and health of their members. The reasons for these accidents are, first of all, that some rural Party organizations and rural work cadres have insufficient understanding of the significance of safety production and strengthening labor protection in large-scale collective production after agricultural cooperativization. Many people believe that agricultural production is different from industrial production and that "there is no issue of safety or unsafety." Therefore, farmers lack the necessary safety production education and inspection.

    Secondly, agricultural production cooperatives lack necessary operating procedures and labor protection measures for large-scale collective labor, basic construction, and driving vehicles and horses, and have not established necessary responsibility systems.

    Thirdly, some agricultural production cooperatives do not allocate labor reasonably according to the different physical strength, technical experience, and physiological characteristics of their members. For example, some places require women and elderly and weak laborers to do heavy work just like young and strong laborers, and even mobilize pregnant women to work. In other places, young people who lack technical skills, have insufficient experience, and are impatient are sent to "crash" certain technically demanding and highly dangerous basic construction projects. Obviously, these are not appropriate.

    In order to do a good job in safety in agricultural production and eliminate casualties, it is recommended that rural Party organizations and rural work cadres pay attention to educating and supervising farmers to pay attention to safety in production, and help them take various safety measures, formulate necessary operating procedures, and establish a responsibility system. At the same time, it is hoped that agricultural production cooperatives in various places can appropriately allocate labor according to the different physical conditions and technical proficiency of their members, so as to effectively carry out safety work in all links.

    加强农业生产中的安全保护工作
    辽宁省锦州地区在实现了农业合作化以后，在农民劳动热情高涨和生产上获得空前丰收的同时，不少地方还发生了一些人身伤亡事故。
    伤亡事件中，以农田基本建设中发生事故、车前马后伤亡和妇女因劳累过度而流产、吐血的事件为最多。这种情况，已经使农业生产合作社在生产上、经济上和社员在生命上、健康上受了很大损失。发生这些事故的原因，首先是有些农村党的组织和农村工作干部对农业合作化后，在大规模集体生产中，必须注意安全生产和加强劳动保护的意义还认识不足，不少人认为农业生产不同于工业生产，“没有什么安全不安全的问题”，因此对农民缺乏必要的安全生产的教育和检查。
    其次，农业生产合作社在进行大规模集体劳动、基本建设施工、和驾驶车马方面，都缺乏必要的操作规程和劳动保护措施，更没有建立起必要的责任制度。
    第三，某些农业生产合作社在劳动力调配上，没有按照社员体力强弱、技术经验、生理特点等不同情况合理调配。例如有的地方要求妇女和老弱劳动力同青壮劳动力一样地去作很重的活，甚至动员孕妇也去作。还有的地方把某些缺乏技术、经验不足和性情急躁的青年打发去“突击”某些技术性较强和危险性较大的基本建设工作，显然，这些都是不适宜的。
    为了作好农业生产中的安全工作，消灭伤亡事故，建议农村党的组织和农村工作干部，注意教育和监督农民注意生产中的安全工作，并且帮助他们采取各种安全措施，制定必要的操作规程，建立责任制度。同时也希望各地农业生产合作社能够根据社员的体质和技术熟练程度等不同情况，适当调配劳动力，以便在各个环节上切实作好安全工作。　种田
