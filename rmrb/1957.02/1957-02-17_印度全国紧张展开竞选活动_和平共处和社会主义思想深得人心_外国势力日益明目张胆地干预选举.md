Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th - Our correspondent Kong Mai reports: The Indian capital, New Delhi, presents a vibrant election atmosphere on the eve of the general election. Large banners with the emblems of various parties are hung across the streets. In recent days, various parties have held mass rallies at Ramlila Ground and Gandhi Ground. Some constituencies even held voting exercises a few days ago.

The Congress Party, the Communist Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the People's League, among other parties participating in India's second general election, have already published their election manifestos, nominated candidates, and an intense campaign is rapidly unfolding nationwide. Compared to the last election, the most obvious characteristic in India's current political life is that the advocacy of peaceful coexistence and socialist ideas has taken deep root in the hearts of the people. The Indian people's desire for peace and Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) is so strong that almost all parties participating in the election talk about maintaining peace. Kitchlew, President of the All-India Peace Council, recently issued a statement calling on candidates and voters to make the struggle for world peace an important part of the election. "Shanti" (Hindi for peace) and "Panchsheel" are the loudest calls of the people at all gatherings. Many parties mention the implementation of socialism in their manifestos. This expression reflects the general trend and the will of the people, although their views on socialism and their practices are different.

In its election manifesto, the Communist Party of India calls for amending the Second Five-Year Plan to make it a genuine socialist construction plan, while establishing a "socialist pattern of society" is the goal announced by the ruling Congress Party. The Communist Party of India believes that only by breaking the control of British capital over important sectors of the Indian economy and eliminating feudal exploitation of peasants can India's economy achieve smooth development.

Indian newspapers point out that in this election, the Communist Party of India is the main competitor of the Congress Party, and the alliance of left-wing parties is more active than in the last election. In the last election, the Congress Party's main competitors were originally sectarian organizations. At that time, the Communist Party of India had just turned from underground to legal, and many cadres were still in prison. However, the result of the election was that the Communist Party of India jumped to become the second largest party, with the number of seats it won second only to the Congress Party. Political observers in the Indian capital believe that in recent years, the Communist Party of India's role and influence in mass movements such as defending peace, opposing the US-Pakistan military treaty and the Manila Pact military bloc, striving for the liberation of Goa, and demanding the establishment of linguistic states has developed significantly. The socialist consciousness of the people has also been improved. A columnist for the Birla Group's newspaper "Hindustan Times," which is pro-Congress Party, wrote: The Communist Party of India is the main competitor of the Congress Party, and people's social parties and sectarian organizations such as the People's League have lost the ability to compete with the Congress Party on a national scale. In recent years, the Communist Party of India's victory in by-elections in places like Bihar has proven that his estimate is not without basis. The "Times of India" recently published long articles on the front page about the alliance of the Communist Party of India and left-wing parties in West Bengal and the growth of the Communist Party of India's strength in Kerala in southern India. This newspaper believes that the Congress Party will "face a serious challenge." At present, the Congress Party is actively forming alliances with sectarian organizations including the Akali Party, the Muslim League, and the Catholics, and is fiercely competing with the Communist Party of India.

The Communist Party of India has put forward the goal of strengthening democratic opposition parties and breaking the Congress Party's monopoly on power. Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, expressed optimism about the future of the West Bengal left-wing party alliance. The Communist Party of India and other opposition parties have also formed election alliances in some other states. However, a nationwide left-wing alliance has not yet been achieved. The People's Socialist Party has been weakened considerably after Lohia split off and formed the Socialist Party because its upper-level leaders pursued an unpopular anti-Soviet and pro-American policy. The People's Socialist Party cannot put forward a clear and forceful program in this election. It is generally estimated that this party is likely to lose some seats in places other than where it is allied with the Communist Party of India.

The People's League has always used inciting Hindu sentiment against Pakistan as its political capital. Currently, it only has some influence in states with relatively large feudal forces such as Uttar Pradesh, but as people's awareness increases, this influence has been declining.

The Congress Party government led by Nehru has won the support of the people by implementing a policy of peace and neutrality, and has raised India's international status. The completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan are factors that are beneficial to the Congress Party in the election. Prime Minister Nehru's personal prestige will undoubtedly also play a role. Due to these factors, coupled with the ruling party's superior position, it is estimated that the Congress Party will continue to maintain its majority in parliament.

With the unfolding of the election campaign, foreign forces' interference in the Indian election is becoming increasingly blatant. India's big bourgeoisie and their agents are also actively engaged. According to the "Times of India," Nehru wrote to Patil, the Congress Party leader in Bombay State, asking him to be vigilant about the imperialists' conspiracy in Bombay to defeat Menon. According to newspaper reports, pro-American groups such as the Democratic Studies Association, the Cultural Freedom Association, and the Free Enterprise Forum are using the alliance formed in the struggle to redraw state boundaries in Bombay to nominate Peter Alvares of the People's Socialist Party as a candidate to compete with Menon in order to undermine Nehru's policy of peace and neutrality. Nehru's brother-in-law, Hutheesing, is also promoting Alvares and attacking Menon. The heads of the Free Enterprise Forum, which aims to develop state capitalism in India, and representatives of Tata Capital, such as Masani, ran from Bombay to the minority areas of Bihar State to become candidates. These agents of big capitalists used various means such as spending money to buy votes. Some served as candidates for the Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, or the People's League, and some participated in the election as "independents." Imperialism and the big bourgeoisie associated with imperialism intend to increase their influence on India's domestic and foreign policies through their agents.

### 印度全国紧张展开竞选活动  和平共处和社会主义思想深得人心  外国势力日益明目张胆地干预选举

    印度全国紧张展开竞选活动
    和平共处和社会主义思想深得人心
    外国势力日益明目张胆地干预选举
    新华社新德里16日电　本社记者孔迈报道：大选前夕的印度首都新德里呈现着一片竞选的气象。马路上横挂着画有不同徽号的各党派的大幅标语。连日来，各党派都在拉姆利拉广场和甘地广场召开了群众大会。有些选举单位前些日子还举行了投票演习。
    参加印度第二届大选的国大党、共产党、人民社会党和人民同盟等党派都已经发表了竞选宣言，提出了候选人，紧张的竞选活动正在全国范围内迅速展开。和上次大选相比，目前印度政治生活当中最明显的特点是和平共处的主张和社会主义思想已经深入人心。印度人民对和平和潘查希拉（五项原则）的愿望是如此强烈，以至于几乎所有参加竞选的党派都谈到要维护和平。全印和平理事会主席克其鲁最近发表声明，号召候选人和选民们把争取世界和平作为选举的重要内容。“香地”（印地语和平）和“潘查希拉”是在所有集会上人民最响亮的呼声。许多党派在它们的宣言中谈到要实行社会主义。这种表示反映了大势所趋和人心的向背，尽管它们对社会主义的见解和它们的作法是不相同的。
    印度共产党在竞选宣言中要求修改第二个五年计划，使它成为名副其实的社会主义的建设计划，而建立“社会主义式样的社会”本是执政党国大党所宣布的目标。印度共产党认为，只有打破英国资本对印度经济重要部门的控制和消除对农民的封建剥削，才有可能使印度经济获得顺利的发展。
    印度报纸指出，在这届大选中，印度共产党是国大党的主要竞选对手，左翼党派的联盟比上届活跃。国大党在上届选举中本来是以教派组织为主要竞选对手，当时印度共产党刚从地下转为合法，许多干部还在狱中。但是，选举的结果是印度共产党一跃而为第二大党，它所获得的席位仅次于国大党。印度首都的政治观察家们认为：这几年来，印度共产党在保卫和平、反对美巴军事条约和马尼拉条约军事集团、争取果阿解放和要求成立语言邦等群众运动中的作用和影响有显著的发展。人民群众的社会主义觉悟也有所提高。亲国大党的比尔拉财团的报纸“印度斯坦时报”专栏评论员写道：印度共产党是国大党主要的竞争者，人民社会党和教派组织如人民同盟等已经失去在全国范围内同国大党竞选的能力。近年来印度共产党在比哈尔等地方补选中获胜，证明他的估计不是没有根据的。“印度时报”最近在第一版连续刊载了印度共产党和左翼政党在西孟加拉邦结成联盟和印度南部喀拉拉邦印度共产党实力增长的长篇报道。这家报纸认为国大党将“面临严重挑战”。目前，国大党正积极同教派组织包括阿卡利党、穆斯林联盟、天主教缔结联盟，并且对印度共产党展开猛烈竞争。
    印度共产党提出了加强民主的反对党派和打破国大党对政权的垄断的目标。印度共产党总书记高士对西孟加拉邦左翼党派联盟的前途表示乐观。印度共产党和其他反对党派还在另外一些邦当中结成了竞选联盟。但是全国范围的左翼联盟目前还没有能够实现。人民社会党因为它的上层领导执行反苏亲美政策不得人心，在洛希亚分裂出去另组社会党以后，已经相当削弱。人民社会党这次竞选提不出明确有力的纲领。一般估计这个党除了在同印度共产党联盟的地方外，在其他地方很有可能要丢失一些席位。
    人民同盟向来以煽动印度教徒反对巴基斯坦的情绪为它的政治资本，目前它只在北方邦等封建势力较大的邦有些影响，但随着人民觉悟的提高，这种影响已经日益衰落。
    尼赫鲁领导下的国大党政府，执行和平中立政策得到国内人民的拥护，并且提高了印度的国际地位。第一个五年计划的完成和第二个五年计划的执行等都是在大选中有利于国大党的因素。尼赫鲁总理的个人威望无疑也将发生作用。由于这些因素，加上执政党的优越地位，估计国大党将继续保持它在国会中的多数地位。
    随着竞选活动的展开，外国势力对印度大选的干预日益明目张胆。印度大资产阶级及其代理人也积极活动。据“印度时报”透露，尼赫鲁曾写信给孟买邦的国大党负责人帕蒂尔，要他警惕帝国主义分子在孟买策动击败梅农的阴谋。据报纸报道，民主研究会、文化自由协会、自由企业论坛等亲美团体正在孟买利用当地在重划省邦斗争中结成的联盟，提出人民社会党的彼得·阿尔瓦雷斯为候选人来同梅农竞选，以打击尼赫鲁的和平中立政策。尼赫鲁的妹夫胡特辛格也为阿尔瓦雷斯鼓吹，对梅农大肆攻击。以及对印度发展国家资本主义为宗旨的自由企业论坛负责人和塔塔资本的代表马萨尼等从孟买跑到比哈尔邦少数民族地区当候选人。这些大资本家的代理人通过花钱收买等各种手段，有的充当了国大党、人民社会党或人民同盟的候选人，有的则以“独立人士”资格参加竞选。帝国主义和同帝国主义有联系的大资产阶级打算通过他们的代理人来增加他们对印度的内外政策的影响。
