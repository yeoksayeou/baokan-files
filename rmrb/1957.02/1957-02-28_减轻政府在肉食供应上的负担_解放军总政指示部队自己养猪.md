Xinhua News Agency, February 27th - The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued instructions on the issue of troops raising pigs, requiring all units to raise their own pigs in order to reduce the government's burden of meat supply.

The instructions stated that the meat supply situation in our country has been quite tight in recent years. In order to alleviate the government's burden of meat supply, all units should, based on their actual conditions, rely on raising their own pigs to solve the meat problem, and strive to achieve partial or complete self-sufficiency in about a year. Each unit will solve the problem of pig feed by themselves. Where green fodder can be grown, more green fodder should be grown to feed pigs. Where possible, the government should be asked to supply some bran. Feeding personnel should be undertaken by cooks or hired with the income from pig raising, but the size of the troops should not be increased.

The instructions stated that this is a major issue concerning the material life of military personnel and involving the relationship between the military and the people. All levels of political organs are required to earnestly study this issue in conjunction with relevant units, make overall plans, and commend and reward units and individuals who have achieved success in raising pigs.

    减轻政府在肉食供应上的负担
    解放军总政指示部队自己养猪
    新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部最近发出关于部队养猪问题的指示，要求各部队自己喂猪，以减轻政府在肉食供应上的负担。
    指示说，近年来我国肉类供应情况相当紧张，为了减轻政府在肉食供应上的负担，各部队应该根据实际情况，依靠自己喂猪来解决肉食，争取在一年左右以后达到部分自给或全部自给。养猪的饲料各部队自行解决，凡是可以种青饲料的地方，应该多种青饲料喂猪，可能时要求政府供给一部分糠麸。饲养人员由炊事员担任或用养猪收益雇请，但不得增加部队编制。
    指示说，这是一个关系到军队人员物质生活而又牵涉到军民关系的重大问题，要求各级政治机关会同有关单位认真研究，统筹进行，并且对目前养猪有成绩的单位和人员予以表扬和奖励。
