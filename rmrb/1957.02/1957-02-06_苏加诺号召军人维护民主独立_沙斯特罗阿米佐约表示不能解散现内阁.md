Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 5th: The Indonesian news agency Antara reported that President Sukarno said yesterday at a military officers' meeting in Bogor that the task of the armed forces is, first and foremost, to safeguard and realize the ideals of the 1945 Declaration of Independence.

He called on members of the armed forces not to undermine democratic principles in the struggle to resolve current difficulties. He said a military commission is not suitable for Indonesia.

Sukarno warned the military to beware of the activities of political parties that attempt to use the army as a tool for their policies.

The head of state reiterated: "Our revolution is not yet complete, especially in terms of our declared desire to establish social justice." He said: "One of the main conditions for the victorious conclusion of our revolution is to establish a strong unity within the army and among the people."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 5th: Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo said on the evening of February 4th that the grievances left over from the Dutch colonial rule still cannot be completely eliminated, "because there are still connections linking the Indonesian people with the former colonial rulers, and that is the Round Table Conference Agreement."

He added: "The abrogation of the Round Table Conference Agreement gives the government the greatest opportunity to formulate its plans in accordance with the ideals of August 17, 1945 (the date Indonesia declared independence)." "The government is making its best efforts to lay the foundation for the immense task of eliminating these grievances."

The Prime Minister was responding in Parliament to a preliminary general debate on the government's statement regarding the Sumatra incident.

Sastroamidjojo emphasized: "The practice of completely dissolving the cabinet and then reorganizing a new cabinet does not guarantee that the Sumatra issue will be easily resolved; all the more so if the cabinet changes only its members and not the policies it implements."

He said that improving the composition of the cabinet should be carried out through discussions between the parties currently forming the coalition government. The issue of the vacant post of Minister of Defense can be resolved by the government parties soon. Regarding the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he said: "Mr. Ruslan Abdulgani -- due to illness -- is no longer actually performing the duties of the minister. His case has been submitted to the Supreme Court for handling."

He said: "As for resolving the Central Sumatra issue, the government insists on a flexible, firm, and correct policy. The so-called 'flexibility' is also the impartiality required by some members of parliament."

Sastroamidjojo reiterated: "In resolving the Sumatra issue, the steps taken by the government are based on the interests and aspirations of the various regions as part of a unified Republic of Indonesia. The government's attitude is: to consider various requirements for regional development within the scope of the entire country."

Speaking on military matters, Sastroamidjojo emphasized that the armed forces must be unified and must abide by the law and military discipline.

He said that because the rebellion launched by Simbolon in Sumatra last December was a clear violation of the law, the government has decided to suspend him from all positions within the armed forces. An order for the arrest of Lubis has been issued. The Prime Minister agreed with the opinions of some members of parliament that the Simbolon incident and the Lubis incident are interrelated.

Regarding the military conference recently held in Palembang to discuss military issues in Sumatra, the Prime Minister said that his government has established a clear policy: although special attention is paid to consultation, order must be maintained.

Sastroamidjojo also said that in accordance with the strategic concept of defending Indonesia, Sumatra will be divided into four defense zones: Aceh, Tapanuli and East Sumatra, Central Sumatra, and South Sumatra.

When discussing President Sukarno's method of curing the country's chronic ills, the Indonesian Prime Minister said he was convinced that the President's ideas would not be unconstitutional, because he knew that the President had opposed any violation of the provisional constitution from the beginning. The Prime Minister said, however, that his government would only put forward its attitude on this issue after the President officially announced his concept.

Sastroamidjojo said that the government regrets that some parties participating in the government have abandoned it at a time when the government must face major tests, and that these parties had been involved in deciding the government's policies for resolving these difficulties until they withdrew from the cabinet. He said that the Masyumi Party could be compared to a cowardly soldier who flees before the battle. The Prime Minister said that his government cannot agree with the demand made by Masyumi Party member Sukiman Wirjosandjojo to dissolve the current cabinet and let the issue be resolved by a new cabinet, because the government is responsible to the Parliament.

The Indonesian Prime Minister's statement aroused great public interest. On the evening of February 4th, many people gathered around the Parliament building to listen to the Prime Minister's speech.

It is expected that a vote of confidence will be held after the end of the second reading debate that begins on February 6th, although the government has not formally requested such a vote.

The "East Star Newspaper" and "People's Daily" in Jakarta on February 5th both published editorials praising the government's response statement. The "People's Daily" said that it was encouraging that the government pointed out that the current dissatisfaction was caused by the Round Table Conference Agreement. The newspaper said that this shows that the government has a clear view of the current problems.

    苏加诺号召军人维护民主独立
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约表示不能解散现内阁
    新华社雅加达5日电　印度尼西亚新闻社报道，苏加诺总统昨天在茂物军官会议上说，武装部队的任务，首先是维护和实现1945年独立宣言的理想。
    他要求武装部队的成员们在争取解决目前的困难时不要破坏民主原则。他说，军事委员会对印度尼西亚并不适合。
    苏加诺警告军人要提防那些企图利用军队作为它们政策工具的政党的活动。
    这位国家元首重申：“我们的革命尚未完成，在我们所宣布的建立社会正义的愿望方面特别是这样。”他说：“要使我们革命胜利结束的主要条件之一是要在军队中间以及人民中间建立牢固的团结。”
    新华社雅加达5日电　阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理2月4日晚说，国内在荷兰殖民统治期间所留下来的不满至今还不能完全消除，“因为还存在着把印度尼西亚人民同前殖民统治者连结一起的联系，那就是圆桌会议协定”。
    他又说：“废除圆桌会议协定，使得政府有最大的机会按照1945年8月17日（印度尼西亚宣告独立的日子）的理想来制订它的计划。”“政府正在尽最大的努力，为消除这种不满的巨大工作奠定基础”。
    总理是在国会进行答辩，国会对政府关于苏门答腊事件的声明进行了初读一般性辩论。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约着重指出：“希望全部解散内阁然后重新组织新内阁的这种做法，并不能保证苏门答腊问题很容易地得到解决；如果内阁所更动的仅仅是它的阁员而不是它所执行的政策的话，那就更不必说了。”
    他说，改善内阁的组成，应该通过目前组成联合政府的各政党之间的讨论来进行。国防部长一职出缺的问题，不久就能由政府各党解决。关于外交部长问题，他说：“鲁斯兰·阿卜杜加尼先生——由于患病——实际上已经不执行部长职务。关于他的案件已经提交最高法院处理。”
    他说：“至于解决中苏门答腊问题，政府坚持灵活、坚定和正确的政策。所谓‘灵活’也就是某些议员所要求的公正。”
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约再次指出：“在解决苏门答腊问题时，政府所采取的步骤是以各个作为统一的印度尼西亚共和国的一部分的地区的利益和愿望为依据的。政府的态度是：在整个国家的范围内考虑关于区域发展的各种要求。”
    在谈到军事问题的时候，沙斯特罗阿米佐约强调武装部队必须统一以及必须遵守法律和军纪。
    他说，由于去年12月西姆波朗在苏门答腊发动的叛变明显地违反了法律，政府已经决定停止他在武装部队内的一切职务。逮捕卢比斯的命令已经发出。总理表示同意一些议员的意见，就是西姆波朗事件同卢比斯事件是互有关系的。
    关于最近在巨港举行的讨论苏门答腊军事问题的军事会议，总理说，他的政府已经确定了明确的方针，就是：虽然特别注重磋商，但是秩序必须维持。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约又说，按照关于保卫印度尼西亚的战略概念，苏门答腊将分为四个防区：亚齐，打板奴里和东苏门答腊，中苏门答腊，南苏门答腊。
    印度尼西亚总理在谈到苏加诺总统的医治这个国家宿疾的方法时说，他确信，总统的想法是不会不合宪法的，因为他知道总统从开始的时候起就一直反对违反临时宪法的任何条款。总理说，但是只有在总统正式宣布他的概念以后，他的政府才提出它对这个问题的态度。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，政府感到遗憾的是，在政府必须面临重大考验的时候，参加政府的一些政党背弃了它，而这些政党一直到它们退出内阁前，还是参加决定政府解决这些困难的政策的。他说，马斯友美党可以比拟为一个贪生怕死而临阵脱逃的士兵。总理说，他的政府不能同意马斯友美党议员苏基曼·威约桑佐约提出的解散现内阁而让问题由新内阁来解决的要求，因为政府是对国会负责的。
    印度尼西亚总理的声明引起公众很大的兴趣。2月4日晚有很多人聚集在国会大厦的周围听取总理的发言。
    预料在2月6日开始的二读辩论结束以后，将举行信任投票，虽然政府没有正式要求举行这样的投票。
    2月5日雅加达的“东星报”和“人民日报”都发表社论赞扬政府的答复声明。“人民日报”说，政府指出目前的不满是由于圆桌会议协定所引起的，这是令人鼓舞的事。这家报纸说，这说明政府对于目前的问题有着明确的看法。
