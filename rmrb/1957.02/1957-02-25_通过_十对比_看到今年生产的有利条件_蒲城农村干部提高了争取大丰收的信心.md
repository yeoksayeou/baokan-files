Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Telegram: The Pucheng County in Shaanxi Province, in its recent three-level cadre meeting, used the method of "Ten Comparisons" to reverse the conservative thinking of some rural cadres, greatly enhancing the confidence of cadres throughout the county in leading farmers to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

After Pucheng County realized agricultural collectivization last year, it achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and the county's grain output reached the level of "one surplus after cultivation." However, the county has abundant land and a small population; the historical pattern is "a major famine every five years, and a minor famine every three years." Therefore, some rural cadres believed that after last year's bumper harvest, there would inevitably be a famine this year. Some cadres also believed that although there was a bumper harvest last year, "human power was exhausted, land fertility was depleted, and potential was fully tapped," and this year there would be "thin land, weak livestock, and less fertilizer." Therefore, catching up with last year's harvest was impossible. Due to these problems in the thinking of the cadres, there was some relaxation in production leadership.

In response to this situation, the three-level cadre meeting in the county explained to all cadres that this conservative sentiment was essentially a reflection of the "relying on heaven for food" mentality of farmers in the era of the individual economy, and did not see the fundamental changes in production conditions brought about by agricultural collectivization. To solve this ideological problem and let the cadres see the favorable conditions for striving for a bumper harvest this year, the meeting adopted the method of "Ten Comparisons" – comparing labor, water conservancy, technology, investment, cultivation, seeds, pesticides, close planting, base fertilizer, and leadership – to educate the cadres.

The comparisons pointed out that the county has already achieved advanced collectivization this year, and the historical difficulty of labor shortage in Pucheng will be further resolved. According to surveys, the attendance rate of members of advanced cooperatives throughout the county can generally increase by 10% to 20% compared with before the establishment of elementary cooperatives. Moreover, with the improvement of labor organization, labor efficiency will inevitably be further improved. The irrigated area of the county this year has expanded five times compared with last year, and if the water conservancy projects planned to be built this spring are added, it can be increased by about ten times, which will greatly alleviate the historical threat of drought to Pucheng County. New farming techniques, such as harrowing and rolling wheat fields to preserve soil moisture, pruning and topping cotton, and artificial pollination of corn, have established prestige among the farmers in the county and will be gradually promoted. Agricultural cooperatives' investments have increased compared to last year. The waterwheels and double-wheeled double-shared plows that have already been ordered are more than three times more than last year. The area of land that has been deep-plowed since last winter accounts for half of the total cultivated land area, an increase of ten times compared to previous years. This year, the county's wheat is basically using improved varieties, and improved varieties of cotton and corn will also be gradually promoted. The area of wheat treated with pesticides has reached 50% in the county, an increase of more than one time compared to last year. Close planting of wheat accounts for 43.7% of the wheat field area, more than double that of last year. In terms of close planting of cotton and corn, a lot of experience has also been accumulated last year. The area of winter crops fertilized with base fertilizer in the county has increased two times compared to last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased from the general two large carts to four large carts. The experience of cadres leading farmers in collective production is also richer than last year.

The cadres attending the meeting, due to recognizing the favorable factors in this year's production and discussing ways to overcome difficulties, have increased their confidence and decided that the county will continue to carry out a high-yield movement centered on grain and cotton in 1957. The unit area yield of wheat in the county will increase by 4.8% compared to last year. Cotton will increase by 31.7%. Various other crops will increase by about 10% to 15% compared to last year.

    通过“十对比”看到今年生产的有利条件
    蒲城农村干部提高了争取大丰收的信心
    据新华社西安电　陕西省蒲城县在最近召开的三级干部会议上通过“十对比”的办法，扭转了部分农村干部的保守思想，大大提高全县干部领导农民争取今年大丰收的信心。
    蒲城县去年实现农业合作化以后，获得空前丰收，全县粮食产量已经达到“耕一余一”。但是，这个县地多、人少；历史常规又是“五年一大荒，三年一小荒”，因此，有些农村干部认为：去年丰收了，今年不免要遭荒歉。还有些干部认为，去年虽然丰收，但是已把“人力使尽、地力拔净、潜力挖净”，今年是“地薄、畜瘦、肥料少”，因此，要赶上去年的收成是不可能的。由于干部思想上有这些问题，在生产领导上便有些松懈。
    针对这种情况，这个县的三级干部会议向全体干部说明：这种保守情绪实质上是个体经济时代农民“靠天吃饭”思想的反映，没有看到农业合作化后在生产条件上所起的根本性的变化。为了解决这个思想问题，让干部看到争取今年大丰收的有利条件，会上即采取比劳力、比水利、比技术、比投资、比耕作、比籽种、比农药、比密植、比底粪、比领导的“十对比”的办法向干部进行了教育。
    在对比中指出：今年全县已经实现高级合作化，蒲城历史性的劳力不足的困难将得到进一步解决。根据调查，全县高级社的社员出勤率一般可以比初级社以前增加10％到20％。而且随着劳动组织的改善，劳动效率也必然进一步提高。全县今年的灌溉面积比去年扩大了五倍，如果加上今春计划兴修的水利工程，更可增加到十倍左右，将大大减轻干旱对蒲城县具有历史性的威胁。新的耕作技术如麦田耙耱保墒、棉花整枝打杈、玉米人工授粉等已在全县农民群众中树立威信，并将逐步进行推广。农业社的投资都比去年增加。现在已经订货的水车和双轮双铧犁就比去年多了三倍以上。全县去冬以来实行深耕的土地占耕地总面积的一半，比往年增加十倍。今年全县小麦基本上都用了良种，棉花和玉米也将逐步推广良种。全县实行药剂拌种的小麦已经达到50％，比去年增加一倍多。小麦密植占麦田面积的43.7％，比去年高出一倍多。在棉花和玉米密植方面，去年也积累了不少经验。全县越冬作物施底肥的面积比去年增加两倍，每亩地施肥量由一般的两大车增加到四大车。干部领导农民进行集体生产的经验也比去年丰富。
    参加会议的干部由于认清了今年生产的有利因素，并且讨论了克服困难的办法，都提高了信心，决定1957年全县将继续开展以粮棉为中心的丰产运动。全县小麦单位面积产量要比去年提高4.8％。棉花提高31.7％。其他各种作物都要比去年分别提高10％到15％左右。
