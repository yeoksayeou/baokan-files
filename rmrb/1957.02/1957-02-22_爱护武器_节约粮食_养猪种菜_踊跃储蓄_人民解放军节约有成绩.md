    Cherish Weapons, Conserve Grain, Raise Pigs and Grow Vegetables, Actively Save
    The People's Liberation Army Achieves Success in Thrift
    (Our report) The organs, troops, and schools of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have maintained and promoted the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and diligence and thrift have been implemented in the daily life and actions of the vast number of officers and soldiers.
    The vast number of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army deeply know that "cherishing weapons and equipment is saving." Thanks to the great attention paid to the maintenance and upkeep of weapons and equipment by various services and arms, damage has been reduced and the service life has been extended. According to incomplete statistics from the armored forces alone, the use time of vehicle engines was extended by more than 33,000 motor hours last year, which can be converted into a value of 8.25 million yuan. Not long ago, the Shenyang troops inspected the weapons and equipment of 21 units, and 88% were in good condition.
    The transportation units have made great achievements in saving fuel. The troops stationed in the Nanjing area saved more than 400,000 kilograms of gasoline and diesel from January to September last year. In 1956, a transportation unit of the Xinjiang Military Region not only overfulfilled the transportation task by 66%, but also saved 350,000 kilograms of gasoline.
    All units attach great importance to saving grain, and the call to "save one tael of rice per person per day" put forward last year has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from troops in Shaanxi, Shandong, Fujian and other regions and the Air Force Logistics Department, more than 13 million catties of grain were saved in the past year. A certain unit on the Zhoushan front line added 15 catties of sweet potato dried for every 100 catties of rice when cooking, in order to save more grain.
    Last year, the troops' quartermaster cooks actively improved stoves and promoted experience in saving coal, so that the amount of coal used for cooking generally decreased. The standard stipulates 1.6 catties per person per day, and many units actually use an average of only half a catty of coal per person per day. Some kitchens even use only six or four taels of coal per person per day on average. This year, all organs and troops have actively responded to the State Council's call to save coal, and the amount of coal used for heating in winter has also been greatly reduced. The Political Academy has reduced its daily coal consumption for heating from 45 tons to 30 tons. The Dezhou Military Service Bureau in Shandong Province merged offices and reduced the number of stoves from eleven to four, and the amount of coal used for the entire heating period was reduced from 20,000 catties to 8,000 catties. All logistics agencies require their subordinate units to burn as much inferior coal as possible for cooking and heating.
    Last year, the entire army saved a lot of expenses by using old clothing items. In order to support national construction, many troops also carried out activities to pick up scrap iron. In order to collect scrap steel scattered in barren mountains and ports, a certain naval base specially established a material cleaning committee, which collected more than 1,300 tons of steel in ten months, worth more than 110,000 yuan.
    The military academies and military schools of the People's Liberation Army strictly practice economy in the expenditure of military education funds. For example, a recent field exercise organized by a certain military academy saved hundreds of catties of explosives, thousands of rounds of ammunition, and reduced the use of 47 vehicles, and the training effect also achieved the expected purpose. The officers and soldiers of various colleges and universities also designed and produced a large number of practical teaching equipment by themselves, saving a large amount of expenditure. Now, various military academies and schools are further taking saving measures to reduce the expenditure of education funds and public miscellaneous expenses.
    Under the condition that it does not affect border defense, coastal defense and training tasks, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army also carried out sideline production such as reclaiming wasteland, growing vegetables, raising pigs, and grinding tofu. Last year, the coastal troops in Zhejiang produced more than 2 million catties of various vegetables, and also raised more than 3,000 pigs and sheep. Last year, a certain unit stationed in Anhui produced 27,000 catties of pork and did not buy a catty of pork from the market throughout the year.
    Depositing the surplus money into the state bank to support national construction is the general atmosphere of the People's Liberation Army. The amount of savings in the state bank of a certain regiment stationed in Xiamen accounts for 65% of the allowances and salaries that the regiment should receive. At present, the vast number of officers and soldiers are enthusiastically purchasing the 1957 economic construction bonds.
    Under the policy of "building the army through diligence and thrift," the simple style of hard struggle of the People's Liberation Army continues to rise, and the entire army is further widely carrying out the saving movement.

    爱护武器　节约粮食　养猪种菜　踊跃储蓄
    人民解放军节约有成绩
    本报讯　中国人民解放军各机关、部队、学校保持和发扬了艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，勤俭节约已经贯彻到广大官兵日常的生活行动当中。
    人民解放军广大官兵深知“爱护武器装备就是节约”，各军种、兵种由于非常注意武器装备的维护和保养，因而减少了损坏，延长了使用时间。仅据装甲兵部队不完全统计，去年共延长车辆发动机的使用时间三万三千多个摩托小时，可折价八百二十五万元。沈阳部队不久以前检查了二十一个单位的武器装备情况，良好的占88％。
    各运输部队节约燃料的成绩很大。驻南京地区部队去年1月至9月，共节约汽油和柴油四十多万公斤。新疆军区某运输部队在1956年不但超额66％完成了运输任务，而且节约了汽油三十五万公斤。
    各部队对节约粮食非常重视，去年提出的“每人每日节约一两米”的号召已经收到很大成绩。据陕西、山东、福建等地区部队和空军后勤不完全统计，去年一年内就节约粮食一千三百多万斤。舟山前线某部，在煮饭时每百斤大米中掺入十五斤地瓜干，以求更多地节约粮食。
    去年部队给养炊事人员，积极改进炉灶，推广节约烧煤的经验，使炊事用煤量普遍下降。标准规定每人每日一斤六两，有不少单位实际用煤平均每人每天只用半斤。有的伙房甚至平均一人一天只用六两、四两煤。今年各机关部队又积极响应了国务院节约用煤的号召，冬季烤火用煤也大大减少。政治学院每天取暖用煤已经从四十五吨减到三十吨。山东德州兵役局合并办公室，从十一个火炉减为四个火炉，全烤火期用煤量从二万斤减为八千斤。各后勤机关要求所属单位，炊事、烤火都尽量烧用次煤。
    去年全军利用被服旧物品节约了大量开支。为了支援国家建设，不少部队还开展了拣废铁活动。海军某基地为了收集散布在荒山和港内的废钢铁，专门成立了物资清理委员会，十个月中就收集了一千三百多吨钢铁，价值十一万余元。
    人民解放军各军事学院和军事学校，在军事教育经费的开支上，厉行节约。例如某军事学院最近组织的一次野外演习，就节约了几百斤炸药，几千发子弹，还少用了四十七辆汽车，训练效果也达到预期目的。各院校的官兵还自己动手设计和制作了大量的实用教学器材，节省了大笔经费支出。现在各军事院校，正进一步采取节约措施，缩减教育经费和公杂费的开支。
    解放军官兵在不影响边防、海防和训练任务的情况下，还进行了开荒、种菜、养猪、磨豆腐等副业生产。浙江沿海部队，去年生产各种蔬菜二百多万斤，还养了三千多头猪和羊。驻安徽某部队去年生产猪肉二万七千斤，全年没有向市场买过一斤猪肉。
    把节余的钱存入国家银行，支援国家建设，是人民解放军的全军风气。驻厦门某团在国家银行的储蓄金额，占这个团应领津贴和薪金的65％。目前，广大兵官又在踊跃认购1957年的经济建设公债。
    在“勤俭建军”的方针下，人民解放军艰苦奋斗的俭朴风气继续上升，全军正进一步广泛开展节约运动。
