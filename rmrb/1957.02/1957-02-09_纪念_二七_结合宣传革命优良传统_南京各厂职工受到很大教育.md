    Commemorating the "February 7th" Incident Combined with Propaganda of Revolutionary Traditions:
    Workers in Nanjing Factories Received Great Education
    (Our Newspaper) Nanjing – In activities commemorating the 34th anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident, workers in Nanjing proposed the slogan: “Carry forward revolutionary traditions, build the country through diligence and thrift in factories.”
    Before "February 7th," factories in Nanjing universally launched propaganda activities to promote revolutionary traditions and the spirit of hard struggle. State-owned factories throughout the city successively adopted forms such as interviews, storytelling, and recollection/comparison to conduct education among workers and cadres. The Nanjing Machine Tool Plant and China Cement Plant held factory-wide "Learning from the Revolutionary Traditions of Veteran Comrades" activity days and "February 7th" propaganda weeks. The Party Committee of Nanjing Automobile Assembly Plant organized eighteen veteran cadres to recount to workers the deeds of hard struggle of workers in military factories during the guerrilla war period. Workers in the factory also visited "February 7th" veteran workers and the mother of martyr Sun Jinchuan. Workers in the Puzhen factories, who held "February 7th" sympathy strikes, said after recalling past struggles: our current happiness was obtained through untold hardships, we must inherit past traditions, work hard, and create a happier tomorrow. Many young workers in factories shed tears after hearing the reports. Zhou Hongsheng, a mechanic at Jiangnan Automobile Company, after hearing the story of the 25,000-Li Long March, once picked up thirty or forty old steel bowls from the factory's scrap pile, cleaned them, and made spare parts for repairing cars, which is estimated to save the country more than one hundred yuan.
    On February 7th, nearly two thousand workers and students in the city held a conference to commemorate the 34th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike. Old workers Zhang Jinting and Liu Shu, who participated in the strike in Wuhan and Puzhen, and Han Xiuying, the family member of a revolutionary martyr, introduced the heroic struggle deeds of their predecessors at the meeting. Peng Chong, First Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also called on all workers in the city in his speech to learn from the example of their predecessors, be diligent and thrifty, and actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy. On the same day, many people, with feelings of mourning, went to the Yuhuatai Martyrs Cemetery to pay tribute to the revolutionary martyrs such as Deng Zhongxia and Luo Dengxian, leaders of the Chinese workers' movement.

    纪念“二七”结合宣传革命优良传统
    南京各厂职工受到很大教育
    本报讯　南京市职工在纪念“二七”三十四周年活动中，提出了“发扬革命优良传统、勤俭办厂建国”的口号。
    “二七”前夕，南京市各工厂普遍展开了发扬革命传统、发扬艰苦奋斗精神的宣传活动。全市各国营工厂先后采用访问、讲故事、回忆对比等形式，在工人和干部中进行了教育。南京机床厂和中国水泥厂举办了全厂性的“学习老前辈的革命传统”活动日和“二七”宣传周。南京汽车制配厂党委组织了十八个老干部，向职工追述了游击战争时期随军工厂工人艰苦奋斗的事迹，该厂工人还访问了“二七”老工人和孙津川烈士的母亲。举行过“二七”同情罢工斗争的浦镇各工厂的工人，在回忆了过去的斗争以后，都说：现在的幸福是经过了千辛万苦才得来的，我们一定要继承过去的传统，艰苦的努力，创造更幸福的明天。很多工厂的青年工人在听过报告以后，感动得流下了泪。江南汽车公司机工周洪生，在听了二万五千里长征故事后，一次就从厂里废料堆中拣出了三、四十个旧钢碗，洗净后做修车配件，估计可为国家节约一百多元。
    2月7日，全市近二千工人和学生举行了大会，纪念“二七”罢工斗争三十四周年。曾在武汉和浦镇参加过罢工斗争的老工人章锦庭、刘树，革命烈士家属韩秀英，在会上介绍了前辈们的英勇斗争事迹；中共南京市委第一书记彭冲在讲话中还号召全市职工学习前辈们的榜样，克勤克俭，积极参加增产节约运动。当天，许多人怀着悼念的心情，前往雨花台烈士墓凭吊了中国工人运动领袖邓中夏、罗登贤等先烈。　（谢祖荫）
