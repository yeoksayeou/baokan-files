The few days of our visit to Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic of the Soviet Union, left us with the most vivid and profound impression: cotton.

Camels leisurely strolled along poplar-lined roads, while beside them, the more massive cotton-picking machines majestically drove past.

In the art museum, we saw that artists were most interested in one theme: oil paintings of boundless cotton fields, and sculptures of cotton-picking girls. We also attended some evening parties, where we heard "cotton farmer selections" in folk songs, and saw graceful movements imitating cotton picking in dances.

In front of the magnificent opera house named after the poet Navoi, there was a large fountain in the shape of a budding cotton boll, with water columns shooting high up, like millions of cotton fibers. At dusk, the lights in the fountain changed colors, reflecting on the water columns, adding to the atmosphere of infinite peace and joy.

Tashkent has recently opened a large stadium that can accommodate 56,000 spectators. The comrade who led us on the tour did not hide his pride when introducing it. The name of this stadium is "Cotton Farmers' Home." The Uzbeks are very fascinated by football, and their football team won a victory in a competition in Afghanistan. The football team is also called "Cotton Farmers' Home."

Cotton, cotton, cotton... cotton everywhere.

This is completely understandable. Uzbekistan is famous for producing cotton, accounting for two-thirds of the total Soviet production. For the people, cotton occupies such an important position and has such a close relationship, how can it not leave a deep mark everywhere in life!

Last December 5th, the day of the Soviet Constitution Day and the opening of the Uzbek Supreme Soviet meeting, in the evening, we watched a song and dance performance at the opera house. Just as the moving voice of a soprano singer aroused enthusiastic welcome from the audience, the head of the theater came onto the stage, and the entire venue quickly quieted down. Something was being solemnly announced on the stage, and the audience below held their breath and listened. At first, we thought something unexpected had happened, but then there was thunderous applause and fervent cheers. The translator told us that they had just received news that Uzbekistan had exceeded its cotton production plan this year, and the republic had been awarded the Order of Lenin. The applause and cheers lasted for a long time, and we were swept into this sea of joy, sharing this supreme happiness.

Because of this kind of infection, we also developed great interest in things related to cotton. One day, we made a special trip to visit the "Kaganovich" Collective Farm, sixty kilometers from Tashkent.

The car passed through fields still with remnants of red cotton stalks, and we were met by large trucks and animal-drawn carts filled with cotton. The last section of the road wound through hilly areas, with streams flowing in the nearby ditches and green poplars along the banks. Turning a corner, there was a wide tree-lined avenue ahead, with newly built wooden houses and some bungalows surrounded by earthen walls, each house with grape trellises and orchards. The farm's office was located here.

The chairman of the farm, Comrade Hamrakul Dursunkulov, accompanied us on the tour. He was tall and straight, with a high forehead, thick black eyebrows and a mustache, wearing an embroidered skullcap, a black cloth jacket, closely spaced gray cotton pants, and tall felt boots. He seemed to have just returned from the fields, or was ready to roll up his sleeves and work at any time. He was already sixty-five years old, but he was still very healthy and cheerful.

We visited several farm members' homes. Whether wooden houses or mud walls, the interior furnishings were very neat and clean. The floors were covered with carpets, the walls were hung with valuable tapestries, and the windows were covered with embroidered curtains. Some families had flower quilts piled up from the floor to the ceiling; others were more Europeanized, with wire beds and writing desks. The radio was playing broadcasts from the capital, and dishes were being cooked on the electric stove. We heard that 29 families in the farm had bought televisions, and 29 families were about to buy them. Some farm members also had their own "Moskvich" cars and motorcycles.

We praised the lives of the farm members, but the old chairman talked about the past of the farm with the expression often seen in old soldiers who had experienced many hardships: before the October Revolution, the land in this area belonged to two landlords, and most of the land was idle, overgrown with thorns and weeds. This was also a hilly area, uneven, with poor soil, mostly alkaline. It was not until 1935 that the first batch of farm members moved in from other places and began to reclaim this wasteland. They brought good soil from afar, spread it on the alkaline soil, and dug ditches to divert water for irrigation, so that crops could grow.

"The old man always likes to compare with the past," the old chairman said, "Our real construction started in 1941. If you had come before, you wouldn't even see houses, and the trees hadn't grown yet. At that time, we all lived in caves. The caves had no windows, no lights, and we relied on the moon to go out at night. There were often owls calling in the middle of the night."

What about now? He didn't continue, because we saw everything with our own eyes: beautiful houses replaced the caves, electric lights replaced the moon, and radios replaced the owls. In addition, there were clubs, open-air theaters, shops, pharmacies, some primary schools, three seven-year schools and one ten-year school, a telephone bureau, a broadcasting room, nurseries, hospitals... The elderly had retirement subsidies, and pregnant women had more than three months of maternity leave. Each family had its own orchard, vegetable garden, dairy cows, and bees.

Looking at their current affluent lives, and then thinking about the old chairman's introduction to the past, it became clear that good days do not come overnight, but through long-term labor and creation. The "Kaganovich" Collective Farm only started building houses six years after its establishment, and it took more than ten years to reach its current scale.

"Our farm is still very young. There are many good farms in the republic, and we hope to catch up with them in the future," the old chairman said modestly. Then, like a summary, he used some figures to illustrate the changes in the farm.

When the farm was first established in 1935, there were 63 households, the cotton planting area was 220 hectares, the yield per hectare was 220 kilograms, and the total income of the farm was 360,000 rubles. In 1956, there were 640 households, the cotton planting area was 1,900 hectares (not including the area of other crops), the average yield per hectare was 4,000 kilograms, and the total income of the farm was 20,058,000 rubles.

Wherever we went, the farm members, regardless of men, women, old, or young, greeted the old chairman cordially. He was respected by everyone like an old father. He was a capable housekeeper, and leading such a farm was not easy, not only in terms of management, but also in terms of the multi-ethnic relations.

The farm members here included eleven nationalities: Uzbek, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Korean, Uyghur, Tatar, Azerbaijani, Ukrainian, Russian, and Jewish. "This is simply a microcosm of our country," as the old chairman said. The living habits of each ethnic group are different, but they get along very well and have never had any quarrels.

"People of each ethnic group have their own characteristics, and we should give play to their respective strengths." The old chairman not only did not feel troubled by the complex ethnic composition, but also introduced their specialties as if enumerating family treasures. For example, Kazakhs are good at managing livestock, Koreans are good at growing rice, Russians are good at tractor and automobile technology, Uyghurs are good at housekeeping, Tatars – some work in the fields, some work in the office, and Uzbeks and Tajiks basically grow cotton.

The old chairman added: "When we plant crops, we don't look at how much money we will earn in the future. As long as the government calls on us, we will do it. Of course, the government will not forget those who work well, no matter what their nationality, they will be given medals, awards, and certificates. Two hundred people in our farm have received various medals, and nine people have received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor."

"But what about you? Please tell us about yourself!" we asked him.

"Me? I herded sheep for the landlords since I was a child, worked as a hired laborer, joined the guerrillas after the October Revolution, and started working in the countryside in 1920. I came here in 1935, and was elected chairman of the farm on October 6th of that year, and I'm still here." He spoke of himself so simply, as if the achievements of the farm had nothing to do with him.

He invited us to "drink tea" in his guest room. The guest room was covered with thick carpets, with a piano, television, and sofa placed against the walls. The bookshelves were filled with Marxist-Leninist works, Pushkin's poems, and Tolstoy's novels. The long table was filled with plates of dishes, bright red pomegranates, crystal-clear white and red grapes, and half a very large and fresh watermelon was placed in front of each person.

The old chairman stood up, raised his glass, and paid tribute to the Chinese peasant brothers. He said that in November 1954, Comrade Khrushchev visited China and came to the "Kaganovich" Collective Farm, sat in this room and talked about many things he saw in China, and especially praised the Chinese peasants. The old chairman wished the Chinese peasant brothers a bumper cotton harvest, and that the friendship between the Soviet Union and China would become closer. We also wished him a long life. He replied, "Thank you! If you work well for the people, you will not grow old."

A reporter from the Uzbek Literary Gazette suggested taking a photo of him. He hurriedly went to change into a woolen coat, and we were suddenly shocked by the medals hanging all over his chest. There were two Gold Star Medals of Hero of Socialist Labor, six Orders of Lenin, one Order of the Patriotic War, two Orders of the Red Banner of Labor, and two gold medals from the Agricultural Exhibition. They were so many, so bright, like stars in the sky.

Regarding the medals, this aroused his interest in talking. He said: "When I attended the 20th Congress of the CPSU in Moscow, I sat with Marshal Sokolovsky. We didn't know each other, and we looked closely at each other's chests. We both had six Orders of Lenin, but one was obtained for peaceful labor, and the other was obtained for defending peaceful labor. In this way, without introduction, we immediately became old friends."

Since leaving Tashkent, Dursunkulov's tall figure, his voice, smile, and that large row of shining gold medals, often vividly jumped into my mind. For some reason, although we didn't spend much time together, it aroused my deep feelings for him.

On February 6th, the "People's Daily" published a photo of the opening of the Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. From the photo, I immediately recognized Dursunkulov's familiar face. Three days later, news came that more than 100,000 Soviet agricultural workers had received awards, and Dursunkulov was specially mentioned. He was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for the third time. I looked at that photo again, and on the old man's chest, next to the two Gold Star Medals that I had seen before, a third Gold Star Medal was clearly hanging.

I am happy for him, and I can't help but tell people the little bit that I know about him. Let me raise my glass and warmly extend my distant congratulations to him, congratulating him on the honor he has received for his outstanding work, and congratulating his farm on achieving even better results this year.

    第三枚金星奖章
    严辰
    在苏联乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干短短几天的访问，留给我们印象最鲜明最深刻的是：棉花。
    在白杨夹道的马路上悠闲地走着骆驼，而从它旁边，更为庞大的棉花采摘机威武地驶过。
    在艺术馆里，我们看到艺术家们最感兴趣的一个题材：油画上是无边无际的棉田，雕塑的是摘棉花的姑娘。我们也参加过一些晚会，从民歌里听到了“棉农选曲”；从舞蹈里看到了模仿采棉的优美的动作。
    在以诗人拿伏伊命名的堂皇的歌剧院门前，有一个很大的喷泉，喷泉的形状就是一朵含苞初放的棉桃，那喷射得很高的水柱，好像千万缕棉花的纤维。黄昏时，喷泉里的灯光变换色彩，映照着水柱，增添了无限安宁、欢乐的气氛。
    塔什干新近开辟了一个大运动场，可以容纳五万六千观众。领我们参观的同志，介绍的时候并不掩饰他的自豪。这运动场的名字，叫做“棉花农家”。乌兹别克人对足球很着迷，他们的足球队到阿富汗比赛取得了胜利，足球队的名字也叫“棉花农家”。
    棉花、棉花、棉花……到处都是棉花。
    这是完全可以理解的，乌兹别克以出产棉花著称，它的产量占全苏联的三分之二。对于人们，棉花占着何等重要的地位，有着何等密切的关系，怎能不在生活里到处留下深刻的痕迹呢！
    去年12月5日，这天是苏联宪法日，又是乌兹别克最高苏维埃会议开幕的日子。晚上，我们在歌剧院看歌舞演出，正当一位女高音歌唱家的动人的声音引起了观众热烈欢迎的时候，剧院负责人走上舞台，全场很快安静下来。台上严肃地在宣布什么事情，台下的观众屏息着在倾听。最初，我们以为发生了什么意外的事件，一会儿，爆发了雷似的掌声和狂热的欢呼。翻译同志告诉我们，刚得到消息，由于乌兹别克今年棉花生产超过了计划，共和国获得了列宁勋章。掌声和欢呼经久不息，我们卷进了这个欢乐的海洋，也分享了这种无上的欢乐。
    由于这种种感染，使我们对于和棉花有关的事物也发生了极大的兴趣。一天，特地去访问了离塔什干六十公里的“卡冈诺维奇”集体农庄。
    汽车穿过还残留着红色棉秸的田野，迎面而来的是堆满了棉花的大卡车和兽力车。最后一段道路蜿蜒在丘陵地带，近处的沟渠里流水淙淙，渠边的杨树还有着绿意。转一个弯，前面是宽阔的林荫道，道旁有着一幢幢新修的木屋和一些围着土墙的平房，每家屋旁是葡萄架和果树园。农庄的办公处就在这里。
    农庄主席哈姆拉库·杜尔松古洛夫同志陪我们参观。他身材高大、挺直，高高的前额，浓黑的眉毛和八字须，戴着绣花便帽，穿一件黑布的上衣，密密行着的灰棉裤，长统毡靴。他好像刚从田里回来，或者是随时可以卷起袖子干活的样子。他已经六十五岁了，可还非常健康、爽朗。
    我们访问了几家庄员的家。不管是木屋，不管是泥墙，农家内部的陈设都很整齐清洁。地上铺着地毯，墙上挂着贵重的壁毯，窗上是挑花的窗帘，有的人家花被子从地板上直堆得齐及天花板；有的人家比较欧化，放着钢丝床和写字桌。收音机里播放出首都的广播，电炉上正做着菜。听说农庄里有二十九家买了电视机，有二十九家正要去买。有些庄员还有着自己的“莫斯科人”小汽车和摩托车。
    我们称羡着庄员们的生活，老主席却用一种经历过不少艰苦的老军人常有的神情谈起了农庄的往昔：十月革命前，这一带的土地属于两个地主，大部分土地闲着，长满了荆棘和杂草。这里又是丘陵地带，高低不平，土质不好，多碱性。直到1935年，才有第一批庄员从别处移来，着手开垦这片荒原。他们一边从远方搬来些好的泥土，铺在碱土上面，一边挖掘沟渠引水灌溉，这样庄稼才生长起来。
      “老头子总爱和从前比较，”老主席说：“我们真正的建设还是1941年开始的，以前你们来的话，连房屋也看不见，树木也不曾长大。那时我们都住的地洞，地洞里没有窗户，没有灯光，晚上出门靠月亮，半夜里常有夜猫子叫唤。”
    现在呢？他没有说下去，因为我们亲眼看到了一切：漂亮的住宅代替了地洞，电灯代替了月亮，无线电代替了夜猫子。此外还有俱乐部、露天剧场、商店、药房、一些小学、三所七年制中学和一所十年制中学、电话局、广播室、托儿所、医院……老人有养老补贴，产妇有三个多月的产假。每家有自己的果园、菜圃、乳牛和蜜蜂。
    看了他们目前富裕的生活，再想想老主席对过去情况的介绍，使人清楚地看到一点：好日子不是一夜功夫得来的，它经过了长期的劳动和创造。“卡冈诺维奇”集体农庄是成立了六年之后才开始建造房屋，又经过十多年的时间才有了今天这样规模的。
    “我们的农庄还很年青，在共和国有许多好的农庄，我们希望将来赶上他们。”老主席谦虚地说。接着他像总结一样，用一些数字来说明农庄的变化。
    1935年农庄刚成立时，庄员有六十三户，棉花种植面积是二百二十公顷，每公顷收获二百二十公斤，农庄总收入三十六万卢布。1956年，庄员已有六百四十户，棉花种植面积一千九百公顷（不计其他作物面积），每公顷平均收获四千公斤，农庄总收入二千零五万八千卢布。
    我们走到那里，庄员们无论男女老少，都亲切地和老主席招呼，他像老父亲一样受到众人尊敬。他是一个能干的管家，领导这么个农庄不是容易的事，不但在经营方面，也在多成分的民族关系方面。
    这里的庄员包括十一个民族：乌兹别克、哈萨克、塔吉克、吉尔吉斯、朝鲜、维吾尔、鞑靼、阿塞拜疆、乌克兰、俄罗斯、犹太。“这简直就是我们国家的缩影”，正如老主席说的一样。各个民族的生活习惯不同，可是他们相处得很融洽，从来没有发生过什么争吵。
      “每个民族的人都有他们的特点，我们就应发挥他们各自的长处。”老主席不但不因民族成分复杂觉得麻烦，反而如数家珍一样介绍了他们的专长。比如：哈萨克族人善于管理牲口，朝鲜族人善于种稻子，俄罗斯族人擅长拖拉机和汽车等技术，维吾尔族人善于料理内务，鞑靼族人——一部分在田里，一部分在办公室工作，乌兹别克族人和塔吉克族人基本上都种棉花。
    老主席又补充说：“我们在种庄稼的时候，并不看将来钱收入得多不多，只要政府号召，我们就干。当然，政府也不会忘记劳动好的人，不管他是什么民族，都给以勋章、奖章、奖状。我们农庄就有两百人得到各种奖章，九个人得到了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。”
    “可是你呢？也请你谈谈自己吧！”我们请求他。
    “我吗？从小给地主放羊，当雇工，十月革命后参加游击队，1920年开始在农村做工作，1935年到这儿，那年10月6日当选农庄主席，直到现在。”他把自己讲得如此简单，好像农庄的成绩和他并没有关系似的。
    他邀我们到他的客室里“喝茶”，客室里铺着厚厚的地毯，墙边放着钢琴、电视机、沙发，书架上摆满了马克思列宁主义的著作和普希金的诗集、托尔斯泰的小说。长桌上是一盘盘的菜肴、鲜红的石榴、水晶似的白色红色的葡萄，每人面前还放了半个很大很新鲜的西瓜。
    老主席就举杯站起，向中国的农民兄弟致意。他说，1954年11月，赫鲁晓夫同志访问中国回来，曾到过“卡冈诺维奇”集体农庄，就坐在这房间里谈过话，谈了许多中国的见闻，特别赞扬了中国的农民。老主席祝中国农民兄弟棉花丰收，苏中友谊更加亲密。我们也祝他长命百岁。他回答：“谢谢！如果为人民工作得很好，人也就不会衰老。”
    乌兹别克文学报的记者提议为他拍照，他匆匆地去换了一件呢子上衣来，我们突然为他挂满在胸前的奖章所震惊。这是两枚社会主义劳动英雄的金星奖章、六枚列宁勋章、一枚卫国战争勋章、两枚劳动红旗勋章、两枚农业展览会的金质奖章。它们那么多，那么亮，如同满天繁星。
    关于勋章，这引起了他的谈兴。他说：“我在莫斯科参加苏共第二十次代表大会的时候，和索科洛夫斯基元帅坐在一起，我们并不相识，互相细看着对方的胸前，都是六枚列宁勋章，不过一个是为了和平劳动得的，一个是为保卫和平劳动而得的。这样，不用介绍，我们立刻成了老朋友啦。”
    自从离开塔什干以后，杜尔松古洛夫的魁伟的影子，他的声音笑貌，以及那一大排金光闪闪的奖章，常常鲜明地在我的脑子里跳动。不知怎的，我们相处的时间虽然不长，却引起了我对他的深厚的感情。
    在2月6日的“人民日报”上，登了一张苏联最高苏维埃第六次会议开幕的照片，从照片上，我一眼就认出了杜尔松古洛夫的熟悉的面影。又三天，消息说苏联十多万农业劳动者得奖，其中特别提到了杜尔松古洛夫，他第三次获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。我又一次看那照片，老人的胸前，在我曾看到过的两枚金星奖章旁边，分明已挂上了第三枚金星奖章了。
    我为他高兴，忍不住要把我所知道的关于他的仅有的一点情况告诉给人们。让我举起酒杯，热烈地向他致以遥远的祝贺，祝贺他由于卓越的劳动而获得的荣誉，祝贺他的农庄今年有更好的成绩。（附图片）
