Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 21st – TASS reports: Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti delivered a speech in Rome on the 19th, discussing certain important issues within the workers' movement. He stated that the principle of transitioning to socialism through parliamentary struggle by no means implies that, due to the natural development of productive forces and social forces, one can sit and wait for the arrival of socialism without the existence of a party leading this movement, without engaging in class struggle against capitalism, and without conducting political struggle against the enemies of socialism.

Togliatti continued, saying that if such an illusion—"to advance is to wait"—were to spread within our party or other parties, the workers would be the first to distrust us.

Togliatti also discussed the issue of the merger between the Italian Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party. He pointed out that if the Socialists and Social Democrats were to come closer on the basis of a program that opens the path for working people to participate in political power, this would certainly be a positive factor, but only under one condition: that they do not believe that there is no need for a mass struggle to win fundamental social reforms, nor believe that moving towards the position held by the Social Democrats in recent years can make this rapprochement something that sufficiently changes the situation in favor of the working people.

    陶里亚蒂说不能坐待社会主义的到来
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂19日在罗马发表演说，谈到了工人运动中的某些重要问题。他说，通过议会斗争的方式过渡到社会主义的原理，决不意味着由于生产力和社会力量的自然发展，可以坐待社会主义的到来，而不需要有领导这个运动的党的存在，不需要进行反对资本主义的阶级斗争和反对社会主义敌人的政治斗争。
    陶里亚蒂接着说，如果这种幻想——“前进就是等待”——在我们党或者其他党内得到流传，那么，首先不相信我们的就会是工人。
    陶里亚蒂还谈到意大利社会党和社会民主党合并的问题。他指出，如果社会党人和社会民主党人在为劳动人民参加政权打开道路的纲领基础上接近，这当然是一种积极的因素，不过要有一个条件：就是不要认为不需要争取根本社会改革的群众性的斗争，也不要认为能到社会民主党人近几年来所持的立场上去，就可以使这种接近成为一种足以使形势改变得有利于劳动人民的东西。
