After the meeting, the representatives will also systematically visit the agricultural exhibition.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Representatives attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Meeting began their general session speeches this afternoon.

A total of eight representatives spoke at the meeting today. They were: Zhang Xingyu, the Secretary of the County Party Committee of Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, who led the county to raise an average of 3.8 pigs per household in 1956; Bao Hanying (Zhuang nationality), the director of Napo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mubi County, Guangxi Province, who achieved the highest single-season rice yield per unit area and large-area high yield in the first year of transitioning to a higher-level cooperative; Yue Yuanqing, the director of Lufeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luxian County, Sichuan Province, who achieved high yields in the first year of trial planting double-cropping rice; Cheng Qinglin, the Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of Xiaomiao Township, Tianmen County, Hubei Province, who implemented a cotton-wheat double-cropping method to achieve a large-area cotton harvest throughout the township; Li Shunda, the director of the nationally renowned Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, who, after continuously suffering from severe hail, wind, and rain disasters, still managed to achieve a significant increase in the cooperative's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations; Huang Haicheng, the director of Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, who created a national record for large-area high yield of double-cropping rice; Wang Guofan, the director of Jianming Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, who has consistently adhered to the principles of diligent and thrifty cooperative management; and Li Chunduo, the Secretary of the County Party Committee of Xingzi County, Jiangxi Province, who made the county shift to double-cropping rice, enabling the county to achieve a large-area rice harvest and transform from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county.

Among the speeches, the most valued by the representatives were the rapid progress in pig farming in Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, after cooperation, and the astonishing strength displayed by the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, in resisting disasters. In Wangcheng County, there were more than 69,000 pigs in 1955, which increased to more than 398,000 after cooperation in 1956. In addition to collective pig farming by agricultural cooperatives, 94.5% of farmers also raised pigs; the income from pig farming accounted for 21.8% of the county's total annual output value, with an average income of 106 yuan per farmer; due to large-scale pig farming, the county averaged about 830 jin more fertilizer per mu of land. In July 1956, a hailstorm in Jinxing Cooperative damaged 84% of the cooperative's crops, followed by a strong wind and several days of heavy rain. At the time, it was estimated that these three disasters would reduce the cooperative's total annual agricultural income by 45%, and more than 50% of the cooperative members would have lower incomes than in 1955; however, they actively carried out production self-rescue and field processing, replanting and converting crops, and expanding sideline production, and finally overcame the disasters, enabling the cooperative's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations to achieve significant increases and exceed the 1956 production plan. The total output value increased by 16.8% compared with 1955, and more than 93% of the cooperative members had higher incomes than in 1955. The representatives unanimously agreed that such achievements—including the eight reports at today's meeting—were unimaginable before cooperation.

The meeting will continue with general session speeches tomorrow (the 19th).

    更好地发挥骨干作用带动全国农民掀起新的生产高潮
    农业劳动模范代表会议开幕
    代表开始发言：望成县养猪一年增加五倍，金星社抗灾显示惊人力量
    新华社18日讯　全国农业劳动模范代表会议今天在北京开幕。
    这次会议的主要任务是通过全国农业（包括渔业、畜牧业）劳动模范的代表、先进农业社代表以及其他有关农业生产先进单位代表的聚会，来交流各地的先进生产经验，鼓励劳动模范们在今年的农业生产中更好的发挥骨干作用，并通过他们带动全国农民掀起一个新的生产高潮，争取今年更大的丰收。
    出席今天会议的，有来自全国各省、区的代表九百多人，和农业部、农垦部、水产部以及中央有关部门的代表和来宾共一千三百多人。在到会的这些代表中，有全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达、郭玉恩、耿长锁、曲耀离和吕鸿宾、张富贵，有坚持三户贫农办社的河北省安平县南王庄农业社社主任王玉坤，有创造七千多亩水稻每亩产一千四百五十五斤全国大面积丰产的福建省海澄县黎明农业社主任黄海澄，有创造全国棉花单位面积最高产量的新疆生产建设兵团某部丰产小组组长薛占春，有实行民主办社获得显著成绩的山西省阳曲县“五二”农业社主任朱文华，有领导发展养猪工作增加社员收入受到表扬的山东阳谷县宋长生农业生产合作社主任宋长生。其他都是在农业、渔业、牧业和国营农场、农业机器拖拉机站、农业技术推广站等方面的先进人物和先进单位的代表。
    会议的开幕式在上午九时举行。各省、区的代表和农业部等有关部门的代表共七十一人组成了大会主席团。今天的执行主席由农业部副部长刘瑞龙担任。
    农业部部长廖鲁言向大会致开幕词（见第三版）。农垦部长王震、水产部长许德珩、水利部长傅作义、林业部副部长张庆孚、中华全国总工会书记处书记栗再温、中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处书记罗毅、中华全国民主妇女联合会书记处书记曹冠群和中国农业水利工会筹备委员会主任何英才都到会讲了话。他们在讲话中对全体农业劳动模范和先进单位的代表在过去工作中取得的成绩都表示敬意，并且祝他们在今年农业生产、民主办社、勤俭办社和推广新技术等工作中获得更大的成绩。
    这个会议预计开六天。会议期间，代表们将听取各地有关丰产经验、民主办社和勤俭办社经验以及苏联专家和中国农业科学研究工作者的专题报告，并将参加20日举行的全国农业展览会的开幕式。会议结束后，代表们还将系统的参观农业展览会。
    新华社18日讯　参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议的代表，今天下午开始大会发言。
    今天在大会上发言的代表共有八人。他们是：领导全县1956年平均每户养猪三点八头的湖南省望城县的中共县委书记张兴玉，转入高级社第一年就获得单季稻单位面积产量全国最高纪录和大面积丰产的广西省睦边县那坡农业生产合作社主任鲍汉营（僮族），试种双季稻第一年就获得高额丰产的四川省泸县泸丰农业生产合作社主任岳元清，实行棉麦两熟耕作方法使全乡取得棉花大面积丰收的湖北省天门县小庙乡中共总支书记程清林，连续遭受严重的雹、风、雨等灾害后仍使全社的农业、林业、牧业和副业获得巨大增产的全国著名的山西省平顺县金星农林牧生产合作社主任李顺达，创造全国双季稻大面积丰产纪录的福建省海澄县黎明农业生产合作社主任黄海澄，一贯坚持勤俭办社的河北省遵化县建明农林牧生产合作社主任王国藩，改种双季稻使全县获得水稻大面积丰收、由缺粮县一跃而变为余粮县的江西省星子县的中共县委书记李春铎。
    发言中最受代表们重视的，是湖南省望城县合作化后养猪事业获得突飞猛进的情况，和山西省平顺县金星农业社在抵抗灾害上所发出的惊人力量。望城县1955年养猪六万九千多头，1956年合作化后发展到三十九万八千多头，全县除了农业社集体养猪外，还有94.5％的农户都养了猪；全县养猪收入占全县全年总产值的21.8％，平均每户农民收入一百零六元；由于大量养猪，全县平均每亩田地约多施肥八百三十斤。金星社1956年7月一场冰雹使全社84％的庄稼受了灾，接着又刮了一场大风、下了几天大雨，当时计算这三次受灾将使全社全年农业收入减少45％、全社50％以上的社员比1955年减少收入；但是他们积极开展生产自救和田间加工、补种改种，扩大副业生产，终于战胜了灾害，使全社的农业、林业、牧业和副业都获得很大增产、超过了1956年的生产计划，生产总值比1955年增加16.8％，全社有93％以上的社员都比1955年增加了收入。与会代表一致认为这样的成绩——包括今天会上的八个报告，在合作化以前都是不可想像的。
    明天（十九日），会议将继续进行大会发言。
