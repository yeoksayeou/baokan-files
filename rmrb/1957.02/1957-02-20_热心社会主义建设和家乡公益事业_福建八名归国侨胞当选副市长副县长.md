Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 19th: In the recent People's Congress meetings held in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou cities, and Fuqing, Jinjiang, Tong'an, Nan'an, and Longyan counties of Fujian Province, returned overseas Chinese Gao Zhirong, Zhang Chukun, Chen Qizi, Xie Baiqiu, Li Jiuling, Ke Chaoyang, Zheng Rihui, and Shen Hui (female) were elected as deputy mayors and deputy county heads, respectively. Since returning to China, these returned overseas Chinese, who have been elected as leaders of government organs, have enthusiastically participated in socialist construction and hometown public welfare, and are loved by the local people.

    Ke Chaoyang, who was elected as the deputy county head of Tong'an County, was already over sixty years old when he returned to China, but he diligently went to the countryside for inspections, wholeheartedly wanting to impart the knowledge of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry that he had learned while living in Singapore to the local farmers. He discovered that some ponds in the countryside were not being utilized, so he suggested planting water hyacinths in the ponds and building pigsties on top of the ponds. In this way, the water used to wash the pigsties could be used to nourish the water hyacinths, and the lush water hyacinths could be used to feed the pigs. This suggestion brought many benefits to the local farmers, and since then, farmers have consulted him on various matters.

    Gao Zhirong, who was elected as the deputy county head of Fuqing County, after returning to China in 1953, took the lead in investing in the construction of local industry and the development of overseas Chinese farms, driving many overseas Chinese from Fuqing, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese to actively invest. This led to the emergence of a mechanized oil pressing factory in Fuqing County, and soon a modern sugar factory will also appear, which will greatly improve the economic life of the people of Fuqing County.

    Overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese are very happy to see their friends or relatives become deputy mayors and deputy county heads of their hometowns. Gao Zhirong had only been the deputy county head for a little over a month and had already received many letters from overseas Chinese asking him about the situation in his hometown.

    热心社会主义建设和家乡公益事业
    福建八名归国侨胞当选副市长副县长
    新华社福州19日电　福建省福州、厦门、泉州三个市和福清、晋江、同安、南安、龙岩五个县，在最近举行的人民代表大会会议上，分别选出归国华侨高至荣、张楚琨、陈启紫、谢白秋、李鸠陵、柯朝阳、郑日晖、沈慧（女）等人为副市长和副县长。这些当选为政府机关领导人的归国华侨，在他们归国以后，就热心参加社会主义建设事业和家乡公益事业，为当地人民所爱戴。当选为同安县副县长的柯朝阳，回国时已经六十多岁，但他不辞劳苦地经常下乡视察，一心一意想把在侨居新加坡时学到的农林、畜牧等方面知识，传授给当地农民。他发现农村中有些池塘没有利用，便建议在池塘里种水浮莲，把猪舍盖在池塘上。这样，可以利用冲洗猪舍的水来滋养水浮莲，用生长茂盛的水浮莲来喂猪。这个建议给当地农民带来了不少好处，从此农民们有事情就向他请教。被选为福清县副县长的高至荣，在1953年回国后，就以身作则投资建设地方工业和开辟华侨农场，带动了许多国外福清籍华侨、归国华侨和侨眷踊跃投资。使福清县出现了一座机械化的榨油厂，不久还将出现一座现代化设备的糖厂，对改善福清县人民的经济生活有很大作用。
    国外华侨、归国华侨和侨眷，看到自己的朋友或亲戚当了家乡的副市长和副县长，都非常高兴。高至荣才当了一个多月副县长，就接到了国外华侨许多来信，向他了解家乡情况。
