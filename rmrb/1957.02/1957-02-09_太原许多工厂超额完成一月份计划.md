    Many Factories in Taiyuan Exceeded January's Production Plan
    (Our Newspaper) News from Taiyuan – In the first month of the new year, eighteen locally-run state-owned and joint state-private factories in Taiyuan City, including Shanxi Chemical Plant and Dazhong Iron Factory, actively launched a production increase and economy campaign and exceeded their state plans.
    According to incomplete statistics, the products by these eighteen units which exceeded their plans include more than twenty kinds such as solid caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, bleaching powder, cloud wood flour, bakelite products, tobacco, soap, white wine, flour, heavy leather, and light leather. In the past, the products of Shunde Cheng Soap Factory were often stockpiled due to poor quality. After switching to self-sales this January, they actively improved quality, thereby expanding sales, exceeding the production plan, and changing from past stockpiling to selling out. (Ma Dengke)
    (Our Newspaper) News – The Shanxi Machine Factory in Taiyuan City, which reached the production level of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in July last year, successfully completed the state-stipulated variety plan again this January, producing major products such as 500-meter drilling rigs, 5-ton hand winches, and 3-ton hand winches. Some of these products are used to support fraternal countries.
    The biggest difficulty this factory encountered in the first month of this year was the lack of steel. They adopted methods such as clearing warehouses, using substitute materials, using scrap steel for steelmaking, and exchanging materials with fraternal factories to ensure production. In addition to completing the variety plan, they also made twenty-eight kinds of miscellaneous products for fraternal factories and mines, thus exceeding the January production value plan by 14%.

    太原许多工厂超额完成一月份计划
    本报讯　太原市区山西化学厂、大中铁工厂等十八个地方国营、公私合营工厂，在步入新的年度的第一个月里，积极开展增产节约运动，超额完成了国家计划。
    这十八个单位超额完成计划的产品，据不完全统计有固体烧碱、盐酸、漂白粉、云木粉、电木制品、烟草、肥皂、白酒、面粉、重革、轻革等二十多种。顺德诚造胰厂过去的产品因为质量不好，经常积压，今年1月份改为自销后，积极改进质量，从而扩大了销路，超额完成了生产计划，并改变过去的积压为脱销。

    本报讯　在去年7月就提前达到了第一个五年计划生产水平的太原市山西机器厂，今年1月份又胜利地完成了国家规定的品种计划，生产了五百公尺钻探机、五吨手摇绞车、三吨手摇绞车等主要产品。其中有的产品是用来支援兄弟国家的。
    这个厂在今年头一个月遇到的最大困难是缺乏钢材。他们采用了清理仓库、利用代用材料、利用废钢炼钢，向兄弟厂交换材料等办法，保证了生产，除了完成品种计划，还为兄弟厂矿作了二十八种零星产品，因此，超额14％完成了1月份生产总值计划。　（黄）
