Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 15th: The Northwest Textile Administration Bureau recently formulated a product classification production plan, which will fully utilize the nearly 100,000 dan of low-grade raw cotton currently available in Shaanxi Province for production. It is estimated that this will increase the national cotton cloth production by more than 120 million meters annually. This new plan will be implemented in cotton textile factories throughout Shaanxi Province starting March 1st this year.

The new plan formulated by the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau, "Adjusting the varieties of cotton textile factories in Shaanxi, implementing product classification, reducing cotton blend ratios, and fully utilizing Shaanxi raw cotton for production," has the greatest advantage of fully utilizing Shaanxi's raw cotton resources, increasing production, ensuring that the quality of most products does not decline, and minimizing changes or limiting the need to change the existing equipment of each factory. According to the requirements of this plan, cotton textile factories in Shaanxi will classify products according to their intended use, and formulate different blending schemes for different varieties and different product uses, in order to change the past situation where factories did not arrange production according to product use, so as to achieve "using superior cotton for superior products, and inferior cotton for inferior products," and rationally use raw cotton. For example, the plan stipulates that market cloth, light-colored printed and dyed cloth, etc., will continue to use first-grade yarn; warp and weft yarns for dark-colored printed cloth will be made entirely of second-grade yarn; dark-colored cloth, flour sack cloth, packaging cloth, etc., will all be woven with seventh-grade cotton. Although cotton knots and impurities will increase slightly, the strength of the cotton cloth will still be maintained.

    实行产品分类　降低配棉成分
    陕西各棉纺织厂合理使用原棉
    据新华社西安15日电　西北纺织管理局最近制定出产品分类生产方案，这样就可以充分利用陕西省现有的近十万担低级原棉进行生产，据估计全年能为国家增产一亿二千多公尺棉布。这个新方案将在今年3月1日在陕西省各棉纺织厂开始实行。
    西北纺织管理局制定的“调整陕西各棉纺织厂品种，实行产品分类，降低配棉成分，充分利用陕西原棉进行生产”的新方案，最大的好处是可以充分利用陕西原棉资源，增加生产，保证多数产品质量不下降，并且能尽量不改变或少改变各厂现有设备。根据这个方案的要求，今后陕西各棉纺织厂将按产品用途实行产品分类，制定不同品种、不同产品用途的不同混棉方案，以改变过去各厂不根据产品用途来安排生产的情况，做到“优棉优用，劣棉劣用”，合理使用原棉。如方案中规定的市布、浅色印染布等，今后将仍用一级纱；深色印花布经纬纱将全由二级纱制作；深色布、面袋布、包装布等将全部用七级棉纺织。这样虽然棉结杂质稍有增加，但仍保持了棉布的坚牢度。
