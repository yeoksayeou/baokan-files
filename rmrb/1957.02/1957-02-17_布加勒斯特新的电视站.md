    Bucharest's New Television Station
    Until the end of last year, Bucharest had only one experimental television station. On December 31st last year, a new television station began operating. Its first program was the broadcast of the New Year's greetings from Dr. Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly. The broadcast went well. Not only in Bucharest, but also in other cities, such as Ploiești, sixty kilometers from Bucharest, and Buzău, one hundred and twenty kilometers away, could the programs broadcast by the new television station be received.
    The new television station is located in a film studio in Bucharest. It has two television transmitters installed on a famous tall building in Bucharest – the "Spark Building." Soon, the public in Bucharest will be able to see more diverse television programs on television sets, including current affairs reports, live broadcasts from theaters, concerts, and sports stadiums, and so on.

    布加勒斯特新的电视站
    在去年年底以前，布加勒斯特只有一座实验电视站。去年12月31日，一座新的电视站开始工作了。它的第一个节目是播送罗马尼亚国民议会主席团主席格罗查博士的新年祝词。播送经过情形良好。不仅在布加勒斯特，而且在其他城市，如距布加勒斯特六十公里的普洛什蒂和一百二十公里的布兹乌，都能收到新电视站播送的节目。
    新的电视站设在布加勒斯特的一家电影制片厂里。它在布加勒斯特一座著名的高大建筑物——“火花大厦”——上面，装有两部电视发射机。不久以后，布加勒斯特的公众将能在电视机上看到更加丰富多采的电视节目，其中包括时事报道，剧院、音乐会和体育场的实况转播等等。
