    Two Poems
            Lü Jian
    Ascending Yueyang Tower
    Where is the vast expanse of lake?
    Where is the azure light of the sky?
    Not even a hint of cloud shadows,
    Only this expanse of blue!
    Dongting, where are your boundaries?
    You are nothing less than the entire universe!
    Ah, those surging, ceaseless waves,
    Seem to have all arrived within my chest.
    Yueyang Tower, Yueyang Tower,
    Please let me ascend yet another level...

    Singing to the Xiang River
    My song, I sing to the Xiang River.
    I sing to her clear, emerald, smooth waters,
    I sing to those layers upon layers of ripples,
    I sing to those sails, full of fresh wind,
    I sing to the flags on the boats, stirred by the sunlight,
    I sing to the rows of wooden rafts drifting down from upstream,
    I sing to the boats laden with rice, oranges, and pomelos,
    I sing to the sunflowers on both banks, turning golden wheels,
    I sing to the tallow trees adorned in purple-red robes,
    I sing to that boundless green grass, filled with affection,
    I sing to those clusters of rice stacks, sleeping soundly,
    I sing to the drooping reflections of washing girls by the riverbank,
    I sing to the gentle, pleasing language trembling on the river,
    I sing to the songs of the boatmen and laborers on the full boats,
    I sing to the bright, luminous sky above the Xiang River. — My song, I sing to the Xiang River.

    诗两首
            吕剑
    登岳阳楼
    哪是淼茫的湖水？
    哪是青青的天光？
    云影也没有半点，
    只见这样的一片碧蓝！
    洞庭，你的边际在哪里？
    你不就是整个的宇宙！
    啊，那奔涌不息的波涛，
    仿佛都来到了我的胸中。
    岳阳楼，岳阳楼，
    请让我更上一层。……
    唱给湘江
    我的歌，唱给湘江。
    唱给她的清碧柔滑的流水，
    唱给那一层连着一层的微波，
    唱给那一片片鼓满了清风的白帆，
    唱给那拂动着阳光的船上的旗子，
    唱给从上游漂流下来的一排排木筏，
    唱给载满了稻米、橘子和柚子的船只，
    唱给两岸上旋转着金轮的向日葵，
    唱给那身披紫红袍子的乌桕树，
    唱给那充满了情思的无边的碧草，
    唱给那酣睡着的一簇簇禾堆，
    唱给江边上浣衣女儿的垂影，
    唱给颤动在江上的柔和悦耳的语言，
    唱给满船的船工和劳动者们的歌声，
    唱给湘江的明丽光亮的上空。——我的歌，唱给湘江。
