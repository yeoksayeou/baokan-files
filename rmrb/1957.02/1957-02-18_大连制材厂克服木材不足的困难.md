Xinhua News Agency report:

    Dalian Lumber Mill has mobilized its workers to find ways to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials. The wood needed for the first half of this year has been basically resolved.
    In the first half of this year's production, the factory needed a total of 6,400 cubic meters of wood, but the state could only allocate 690 cubic meters of logs. Faced with this serious difficulty, factory leaders convened workers, technicians, and cadres several times to conduct repeated investigations and find solutions to the wood shortage problem. They first checked the inventory and found 3,300 cubic meters of various types of wood that could be used, which could sustain the factory's production for a quarter. Immediately afterwards, they mobilized designers to modify the design of 50% of the products, ensuring quality and without changing the appearance of the products. This could save 390 cubic meters of finished wood. The factory leaders also organized technicians to successfully research and develop "glued wood" from waste materials to make bottom plates, partitions, and skirting boards for desks, cabinets, etc., which could replace 530 cubic meters of wood in the first half of the year.
    Workers at various production and processing posts have also found many good ways to improve the wood yield. Employees have successfully researched the use of thin-kerf gang saws instead of circular saws to cut wood, increasing the wood yield by 18.6% compared to the past.
    Through various efforts, the factory's employees have basically solved the problem of wood needed in the first half of the year.

    大连制材厂克服木材不足的困难
    据新华社讯　大连制材厂发动职工从多方面想法克服原材料不足的困难，今年上半年全厂所需要的木材，已经基本上得到解决。
    这个工厂在今年上半年的生产中，共需要六千四百立方公尺木材，国家只能拨给六百九十立方公尺原木。在这个严重的困难面前，工厂的领导者召集工人、技术人员和干部座谈好几次，进行反复摸底，寻找解决木材不足问题的办法。他们首先清查库存情况，查出了可以利用的各种木材达三千三百立方公尺，这些木材能使工厂维持一个季度的生产。紧接着又发动设计人员在保证质量、不改变产品外貌情况下，修改了50％的产品设计，这样可以节约成材三百九十立方公尺。这个工厂的领导者又组织技术人员们研究成功用废料做“胶合木”，做写字台、立柜等的底板、格板和裙板，上半年就可以代替五百三十立方公尺木料。
    工人们在各个生产和加工的岗位上，也找出不少提高出材率的好办法。职工们研究成功了用锯路小的夹锯代替圆锯割木料，出材率比过去提高18.6％。
    这个工厂的职工经过多方面的努力，上半年所需要的木料，已经得到基本解决。
