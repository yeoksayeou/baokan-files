    The Malice of American "Philanthropists"
                Lu Ying
      In his recent "State of the Union Address," U.S. President Eisenhower, in addition to reiterating his old tune of "strength policy," specifically proposed providing refuge for Hungarian refugees and requested Congress to enact legislation to determine the status of Hungarian refugees in the United States. It seems that the U.S. ruling group has placed the Hungarian refugee issue at the level of national policy.
    People know that after the failure of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, U.S. officials and numerous U.S. charitable organizations put on a charitable face and made a big fuss about the Hungarian refugee issue. The U.S. President once called on the nation to "guarantee that Hungarian refugees receive housing, employment, and economic assistance," and requested Congress to pass a bill allowing Hungarian refugees to reside permanently in the United States. He also established a fifteen-member "President's Committee" specifically to handle the Hungarian refugee issue. U.S. Vice President Nixon was ordered to conduct an "inspection" in Austria, and U.S. air and sea transport forces were dispatched in large numbers to rush Hungarian refugees away from their homeland.
    Why is the U.S. ruling group making such a big fuss about the Hungarian refugee issue, even placing it at the level of national policy?
    U.S. government authorities describe this as a "humanitarian work" and express "pride" in it. This is, of course, not true. Even many Americans doubt the "humanitarian" heart professed by the U.S. government and question in newspapers why the U.S. government does not care for American blacks as it cares for Hungarians. And people know that the United States has three million unemployed, and the lives of most blacks, in particular, are very miserable. Moreover, the "Pittsburgh News" pointed out that the United States rarely mentions the suffering of the Egyptian people due to the attacks by Britain, France, and Israel. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine that the "concern" shown by the U.S. government for Hungarian refugees truly comes from a "humanitarian" heart.
    The fact is that the U.S. big shots' "concern" for Hungarian refugees has ulterior motives. The U.S. "New York Daily News" revealed the U.S. authorities' sinister intentions in this matter. The newspaper openly suggested forming Hungarian refugees into an anti-communist army. It said: "After being trained in the United States, they will join our armed forces. Once a war breaks out, they will become a combat unit of our army, a unit that is like a dagger ready to stab the throat of the Communist Party and stab into Budapest." U.S. Vice President Nixon, upon landing at the Austrian airport, gleefully said: "I hope to obtain first-hand information from the refugees themselves." It is evident that the U.S. is making a big fanfare about the Hungarian refugee issue not for the sake of the refugees themselves, but to recruit the backbone of Wall Street's "secret army" under the guise of "sympathizing with suffering people," in preparation for further plotting subversion conspiracies in the future.
    Engaging in such "charitable" undertakings with such malicious intent is nothing new for the United States. In the years after World War II, many so-called exiled "refugee" organizations directly commanded by the U.S. intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, emerged in the United States, gathering exiles from Eastern European countries to engage in espionage and special agent activities. Among these organizations were the so-called "East European Mid-European Committee," "Federation of Hungarian Americans," "Czechoslovak Struggle Committee," etc. Without exception, their purpose was to subvert the people's democratic regimes of their own countries; their funding was provided by U.S. intelligence agencies or institutions such as the U.S. "Crusade for Freedom" and the Rockefeller Foundation. According to statistics, the reactionary organization called "Crusade for Freedom" alone allocated as much as 33 million U.S. dollars annually to the aforementioned exiled "refugee" organizations for their activities. The U.S. authorities' actions on the Hungarian refugee issue are merely another development of this sinister activity.
    It is worth noting the U.S. attempt to use Hungarian "refugees" to organize an anti-communist army. Because the U.S. Department of Defense has long had a plan to send armed elements to Eastern European countries to carry out conspiracy activities. As early as 1952, the U.S. Department of Defense passed a plan to send saboteurs to Eastern European people's democratic countries as an important part of conducting "cold war and hot war." Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Defense established a special department called the "Special Warfare Act" in 1952. This agency led the special forces at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and two special groups: the 77th Group at Fort Bragg and the 10th Group in Germany. According to the "New York World-Telegram and Sun," many of these troops were "immigrants" recruited from Balkan countries. The "New York Times" also wrote in a report that "there is a special feeling about this kind of troops (referring to the special forces at Fort Bragg). The first impression people have is that they are all foreigners," and said: "If war breaks out again, these special forces will go to the enemy's rear. In fact, many of them will return to their old homes, because the soldiers of the special forces include many refugees who have suffered under the Communists."
    The United States not only uses refugees to organize such special forces in its own country, but also engages in this sinister activity in other countries. The members of the "Free Europe College" established by the "Free Europe Committee" in France are selected from some exiles lured out of Eastern European countries by the United States. A correspondent for the British "Manchester Guardian" reported that the purpose of the exiles' training at this college is: "As soon as the situation permits, the students must return to their own countries. They are being trained to become a new elite cadre to take over the liberated people's democratic countries."
    The United States' mobilization of naval and air forces to abduct Hungarian refugees this time aims to force the refugees to serve as tools for the United States to continue conducting espionage and subversion activities in Hungary and to expand the aforementioned so-called special forces. News about Hungarian refugees sent by U.S.-based reporters from some Austrian newspapers also proves this point. The reports said that the person in charge of transporting Hungarian refugees in the United States was not a representative of the Red Cross, but an American general named B. Dani. Furthermore, after Hungarian refugees were transported to the United States, they were not sent to the places where ordinary immigrants should go, but to Camp Kilmer, fifty kilometers away from New York. This camp is a huge camp that once housed twenty U.S. divisions during World War II. Austrian "Neue Express" and "Kleine Volkszeitung" reported that Hungarian refugees are required to give their fingerprints after being transported to the camp. If they cannot find a job, they must join the U.S. military, especially young people. No wonder Nixon said in Munich that after returning to the United States, he "will advocate helping young people and students among the refugees." The mask of American philanthropists has now been completely unmasked.
    Facts have proven that under the hypocritical mask of "relief" and "assistance" to Hungarian refugees, the U.S. government hides a fierce and malicious heart, which is to use Hungarian refugees to intensify the "cold war." This is why the U.S. government places this issue at the level of national policy.

    美国“慈善家”的坏心肠
                鲁映
      美国总统艾森豪威尔在他最近发表的“国情咨文”里，除了重弹其“实力政策”的陈腔滥调之外，还特别提出要为匈牙利难民提供避难所，并要求国会制定立法以确定匈牙利难民在美国的地位。看来，美国统治集团已把匈牙利的难民问题放置在国家政策的水平上了。
    人们知道在匈牙利反革命叛乱失败以后，美国官方及名目繁多的美国慈善机关，就摆出一付慈善的面孔，在匈牙利难民问题上大做文章。美国总统曾号召全国人民“保证使匈牙利难民获得住房、职业和经济上的援助”，并要求国会通过一项使匈牙利难民能够在美国永久居住的法案，还专门成立了一个处理匈牙利难民问题的十五人“总统委员会”。美国副总统尼克松为此曾受命到奥地利进行了“视察”，美国海空军的运输部队并大批出动抢运匈牙利难民。
    美国统治集团在匈牙利难民问题上这样大做文章，甚至把这个问题放置在国家政策的水平上，这是为了什么呢？
    美国政府当局把他们的这种作为说成是一种“人道工作”，并且表示以此而“自豪”。这当然不是真实的，连许多美国人对于美国政府所标榜的“人道”心肠也表示怀疑，并在报纸上质问，为什么美国政府不像关怀匈牙利人那样的关怀美国的黑人？而人们知道，美国有着三百万的失业者，特别是大多数的黑人的生活是十分悲惨的。不止如此，“匹兹堡新闻报”还指出：美国很少提到由于英、法、以色列三国的进攻使埃及人民遭受的苦难。因此，很难想像，美国政府对匈牙利难民表示的“关怀”真正是出于“人道”心肠。
    事实是，美国的大人先生们为匈牙利难民的“关怀”是别有用心的。美国“纽约日报”透露了美国当局在这个事情上所怀抱的罪恶目的。这个报纸公开建议把匈牙利难民组成一支反共军队。并且说：“在美国经过训练后，他们将加入我们的武装部队，一旦发生战争，他们便成为我们军队的一支作战部队，这支部队就像是一把准备刺入共产党咽喉和刺入布达佩斯的匕首”。美国副总统尼克松在奥地利机场一着陆，就得意忘形地说：“我希望从难民自己那里获得第一手的情报”。可见，美国大张旗鼓地在匈牙利难民问题上做文章，其目的不是在难民本身；而是在“同情苦难的人”的幌子下招募华尔街“秘密大军”的骨干，以备将来进一步策划颠复阴谋。
    怀着这种恶毒的目的，进行这样的“慈善”事业，在美国说来并不是什么新鲜事情。在第二次世界大战之后的年代中，在美国出现了许多由美国特务机关中央情报局直接指挥的所谓流亡“难民”组织，搜罗东欧国家流亡分子，来从事间谍和特务活动。在这些组织中，有所谓“东欧中欧委员会”、“旅美匈牙利人联合会”、“捷克斯洛伐克斗争委员会”等等，它们毫无例外地都是以颠复本国的人民民主政权作为本身活动的目的；它们的经费都是由美国特务机关，或者是美国的“争取自由十字军”和洛克菲勒基金这种机构供给的。据统计，像所谓“争取自由十字军”这个反动组织，每年拨给上述各流亡“难民”组织的活动费用即达三千三百万美元。美国当局在匈牙利难民问题上所做的文章，不过是这种罪恶活动的又一发展。
    值得注意的是，美国企图利用匈牙利“难民”组织一支反共军队的打算。因为美国国防部早有一种派遣武装分子到东欧国家进行阴谋活动的计划。还在1952年，美国国防部就通过了一项计划，以向东欧人民民主国家派遣破坏分子作为进行“冷战和热战”的一个重要部分。并且，就在1952年美国国防部就成立了一个“特殊作战法”专署。这个机关领导了北卡罗来纳州布拉哥堡的特别部队和两个特别小组：一个是布拉哥堡的第七十七小组，一个是在德国的第十小组。据“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”透露，这些部队中有许多人是招募来的巴尔干国家的“移民”。“纽约时报”在报道中也曾写道，“对这种部队（即指布拉哥堡的特别部队）有一种特殊的感觉，人们的第一个印象就是他们都是外国人”，并且说：“假如再度发生战争，这些特种部队将到敌人的后方去，事实上其中的许多人都要回到老家，因为特种部队的士兵中包括许多曾在共产党下面受过苦难的难民”。
    美国不仅在本国利用难民组织这种特种部队，而且也在别的国家进行这种罪恶勾当。“自由欧洲委员会”在法国所设立的“自由欧洲学院”中的成员就是美国从东欧国家诱骗出来的一些流亡分子中挑选的。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”特派员曾报道说，流亡分子在这个学院受训的目的是：“一到情况许可时，学生们必须回到他们的本国去。他们正被训练成为新的优秀干部来接管解放后的人民民主国家。”
    美国这次出动海、空军劫夺匈牙利难民，目的就是要迫使难民们来充当美国在匈牙利继续进行间谍和颠复活动的工具，并扩大上述的所谓特别部队。奥地利一些报纸的驻美记者发出的关于匈牙利难民的消息，也证明了这一点。报道说，美国主持运送匈牙利难民的不是什么红十字会的代表，而是一个叫做布·达尼的美国将军。并且匈牙利难民在被运到美国后，不是被送到通常移民应当去的地方，而是被送到离纽约五十公里远的圣耳默兵营去。这个兵营是一个在第二次世界大战期间曾经驻扎过二十个美国师的庞大兵营。奥地利“新快报”和“小人民报”报道说，匈牙利人在被运到兵营之后都要按下指印，如果找不到工作，他们就必须加入美国军队，特别是青年。怪不得，尼克松在慕尼黑的时候就说，在他回到美国后，“将主张帮助难民中的青年人和学生”。美国慈善家的面孔至此已被完全揭穿了。
    事实证明美国政府在“救济”和“援助”匈牙利难民的伪善面幕下，藏着一付凶恶的坏心肠，那就是要利用匈牙利难民来加紧进行“冷战”。这就是为什么美国政府把这个问题放置在国家政策水平上的原因。
