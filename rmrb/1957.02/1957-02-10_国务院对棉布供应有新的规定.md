The instructions stipulate that from February 10th of this year, all children's clothing (large and small sizes) and cloth shorter than five inches will be charged according to the actual cloth used; mosquito netting cloth will be charged at a 2-fold rate (i.e., two inches of cloth coupon for every foot of cloth), and the top cloth, side cloth, and clothing mesh fabric of finished mosquito nets will all be charged according to the actual cloth used.

The instructions also require all localities to cooperate with the development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign and find ways to save some cotton cloth in preparation for supplying the market during the peak season after autumn.
