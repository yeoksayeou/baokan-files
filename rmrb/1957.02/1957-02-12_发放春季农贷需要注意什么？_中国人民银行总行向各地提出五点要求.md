Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The People's Bank of China Headquarters issued instructions on the 10th to branches in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, requesting that they do a good job in spring agricultural loans and deposit payments to support spring plowing production.

The instructions pointed out that the main task of rural financial work in the spring is to issue spring plowing production loans in a timely and reasonable manner, while also doing a good job in paying out farmers' deposits, to provide agricultural cooperatives and members with the necessary production funds and help them lay the foundation for the year's production, thereby striving to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

The instructions pointed out that last year, with the rapid development of agricultural cooperation, rural financial work, while completing huge loan tasks, also produced the shortcoming of rough work. The instructions require that this spring, when issuing loans and carrying out other tasks, rural financial cadres should further improve the quality of their work, so that the funds invested are more rationally allocated and used, and that their work methods and work style are better adapted to the requirements of agricultural cooperatives and the masses of members.

The instructions said that the agricultural loan funds that can actually be issued this year are approximately 900 million yuan, which is a decrease compared to last year in terms of numbers. However, a comprehensive analysis of the relevant situations in all aspects shows that the production and living funds problems of agricultural cooperatives and the vast number of farmers can basically be properly resolved. This spring, the amount of funds that can be used for agricultural loans, advance purchase deposits, and credit cooperative funds is 1.7 to 1.8 billion yuan. The financial strength of agricultural cooperatives themselves has also been strengthened compared to last year. The state issued a large number of agricultural loans to agricultural cooperatives last year that have not yet been fully recovered. Most agricultural cooperatives achieved a bumper harvest last fall, and various economic activities were carried out in winter. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives themselves already have some accumulation. In particular, with the widespread development of the increased production and economy campaign this year, agricultural cooperatives have one year of experience in running the cooperative, and will pay more attention to saving and rationally using production funds. Among the members of the cooperative, due to the large number of poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans issued last spring and the winter before last, the difficulty of poor farmers joining the cooperative has been basically resolved. In addition, the vast majority of members have increased their actual income due to the autumn harvest distribution last year. The number of people who will experience living difficulties this spring, excluding disaster areas, will also decrease compared to last year. Therefore, although the agricultural loan funds actually issued this year are less than last year, if they can be used reasonably, it is still an important force for solving the financial difficulties of this year's spring plowing production.

In order to do a good job in spring agricultural loans, the instructions put forward five requirements:

    First, under the leadership of the local Party and government organs, cooperate with relevant departments to uniformly arrange various funds invested in rural areas to avoid duplication and disconnection in the use process.

    Second, require local Party and government leaders to incorporate agricultural loan work into the unified arrangement when arranging spring plowing production, and cadres in charge of production should care about the allocation and use of loans and related funds, to ensure reasonable allocation and proper use.

    Third, under the guidance of the policy of increasing production and practicing economy and running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, master the issuance of loans based on the agricultural cooperative's production plan and financial plan. State loans are mainly used to solve the reasonable needs of agricultural cooperatives in terms of production expenses turnover. Loans for long-term basic construction projects are generally not granted or are granted as little as possible. When determining the amount of loans to agricultural cooperatives, both the needs of the agricultural cooperative and the loan power that the state can provide must be considered.

    Fourth, for loans to members of the cooperative, in areas where the credit cooperative has a strong force, the credit cooperative should be responsible for solving it; in areas where the credit cooperative has a small force, the difficulties of the masses should be solved through the bank's financial support to the credit cooperative.

    Fifth, appropriately pay attention to supporting the sideline businesses of agricultural cooperatives (such as animal husbandry, pig raising, etc.), so that they may be able to increase the actual income of the cooperative and individual members more through the development of sideline businesses.

In addition, the instructions also emphasized the importance of credit cooperatives doing a good job in deposit payment, requiring all localities to organize the force for paying deposits and ensure the convenience of withdrawals.

    发放春季农贷需要注意什么？
    中国人民银行总行向各地提出五点要求
    新华社11日讯　中国人民银行总行10日向各省、市、自治区分行发出指示，要求各地做好春季农业贷款和存款支付工作，以支援春耕生产。
    指示指出，春季农村金融工作的主要任务，就是要及时和合理地发放春耕生产贷款，同时作好对农民存款的支付工作，以供应农业社和社员以必要的生产资金，帮助他们为全年生产打下基础，从而争取实现今年农业的丰收。
    指示指出，去年在农业合作化迅速发展的情况下，农村金融工作在完成巨大贷款任务的同时，也产生了工作粗糙的缺点。指示要求今年春季在发放贷款和进行其他各项工作时，农村金融工作干部应该进一步提高工作质量，使投放出去的资金，分配使用更加合理；使自己的工作方法和工作作风，更能适应农业社和社员群众的要求。
    指示说，今年实际可以发放的农贷资金大约有九亿元，从数字上看，比去年是有所减少。但是全面的分析一下各方面的有关情况，就可以看到，今年农业社和广大农民的生产、生活资金问题，基本上是可以得到妥善地解决的。在今年春季，以农业贷款、预购定金和信用社资金三项来说，可动用的数额就有十七、八亿元；农业社本身的资金力量也比去年加强，国家去年发放给农业社大批农贷尚未全部收回，去年秋季大部分农业社获得了丰收，冬季又开展了多种经济活动，因此农业社本身已经有了一些积累，特别是今年随着增产节约运动的广泛展开，农业社有了一年办社的经验，对生产资金的使用必将更加注意节约合理；在社员群众方面，由于去年春天和前年冬天，发放了大批贫农合作基金贷款，基本上解决了贫困农民入社基金的困难，加上去年秋收分配，绝大多数社员都增加了实际收入，在今年春季中将发生生活困难的人，除去灾区以外，也将比去年减少。因此，今年实发的农贷资金虽然比去年有所减少，但如果能够合理使用，它对解决今年的春耕生产的资金困难，仍然是一个重要的力量。
    为了做好春季农贷工作，指示提出了五点要求：
    第一、要在当地党、政机关领导下，配合有关部门统一安排当地投向农村的各项资金，避免发生使用过程中的重复和不衔接现象。
    第二、要求各地党政领导在安排春耕生产时，把农贷工作统一安排进去，负责领导生产的干部要关心贷款和有关资金的分配使用，保证分配合理，使用得当。
    第三、要在贯彻执行增产节约与勤俭办社的方针下，根据农业社的生产计划和财务计划，掌握贷款的发放。国家贷款主要用来解决农业社生产费用周转方面的合理需要，对长期的基本建设性质的贷款，一般不贷或尽量少贷。确定农业社的贷款数额时既要根据农业社的需要，也要根据国家可能拿出的贷款力量。
    第四、对于社员的贷款，在信用社力量较大的地区，应由信用社负责解决；在信用社力量较小的地区，通过银行对信用社的资金支持，解决群众的困难。
    第五、适当注意对农业社副业（如牧畜、养猪等）的扶持，以便使他们有可能通过副业的发展，更多地增加社和社员个人的实际收入。
    此外，指示还强调指出了信用社做好存款支付工作的重要性，要求各地组织支付存款的力量，保证取款的方便。
