    Fellow Travelers
    Xu Guangyu
    My brother and I set out together. Our destination is the same, not exactly close, not exactly far, requiring us to walk steadily for a while, undoubtedly.
    I wore a magnifying glass. After only fifty steps, I lowered my head and discovered a small puddle of water. This was a great discovery for me. I squatted down, studied it again and again, described it again and again, indicating that this journey would be full of hardships and the future was not optimistic.
    My brother, however, stepped over this puddle and strode forward. He had a telescope around his neck, pressed to his eyes, exclaiming that the scenery ahead was beautiful and wonderful. When he had proceeded smoothly for about a hundred steps, a rather wide gully lay across his path. If he had seen it, he could have jumped over it, and even if he couldn't, a shout to me, and the two of us could easily have filled it in. But he didn't see it. He ended up tumbling.
    We discussed it for a while and continued to move forward. The only thing worth reporting is that my brother did not break my magnifying glass, nor did I ask him to throw away his telescope.

    我和我的兄弟结伴登程。我们的目的地是一个，说近不近，说远不远，需要结结实实地走一阵是无疑的。
    我戴着一个放大镜，才走了五十步，低头发现一个小小的积水洼，这在我却是一个大发现。我蹲了下来，研究了又研究，描绘之又描绘，表示由此可见，此行艰险重重，前途不可乐观。
    我的兄弟却一脚跨过这个积水洼，大步向前走去。他脖子上套着一架望远镜，扣在眼上，高呼前面美啊妙啊。当他顺利行进到一百步光景，他的面前横着一道相当阔的沟壑。如果他看见了，他跳得过去，即使跳不过，招呼我一声，两个人也容易填平它。可是他没有看见。他只好跌跟斗了。
    我们商量了一会，继续前进。值得报告的只有一点，我的兄弟并没有打碎我的放大镜，我也没有要他扔掉他的望远镜。
