To fully supply new farm tools and repair old farm tools in a timely manner, the Nanchang Prefecture is mobilizing the handicraft industry to support spring plowing.

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 17th) To implement the policy of local industry serving the rural economy, the local industrial departments of various counties in Nanchang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, are mobilizing all forces to support spring agricultural production.

The industrial departments of the county committees of Pingxiang, Yichun, Fengcheng, Qingjiang, Nanchang, Gaoan, and other counties have selected cadres from the industrial and handicraft management departments to form working groups to conduct typical investigations and visits in rural areas. They are understanding the needs of farmers and soliciting opinions and requirements from farmers regarding the product specifications, quality, and quantity of agricultural tools needed for each agricultural season. According to the investigations and visits in various counties, the farmers' need for agricultural tools this year, especially small farm tools, has increased compared to last year, both in terms of repair and new production.

According to the investigation by Futian Cooperative in Pingxiang County, the need for newly made small farm tools this year has increased by two times compared to last year. After investigating, visiting, and understanding the needs of farmers, the industrial departments, factories, enterprises, and handicraft cooperatives of various counties have formulated plans for producing agricultural tools, some have signed production and sales contracts with agricultural cooperatives, and others are actively preparing raw materials. In Yichun County alone, twelve iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft cooperatives have signed seventy-two production and sales contracts with agricultural cooperatives, newly producing 26,085 various large and small farm tools. As of now, the handicraft cooperatives in Xinjian, Yifeng, Jing'an, Tonggu, and other counties have repaired and manufactured more than 17,400 various iron, wood, and bamboo large and small farm tools for farmers.

The Industry and Transportation Department of the Nanchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China requires the industry and transportation bureaus and handicraft management bureaus of various counties to strengthen political and ideological leadership, earnestly educate employees and cooperative members, establish the idea of serving agricultural production, and criticize the capitalist management style of "only caring about making money and not caring about quality" and "cutting corners and producing shoddy products." It requires that product quality achieve the "three guarantees" of "guaranteed use, guaranteed repair, and guaranteed round trip"; organize and establish farm tool repair and fitting stations; organize cooperative members to go to the countryside to help repair farm tools, ensuring that "new farm tools are supplied, old farm tools are repaired in a timely manner," without delaying the farming season, and fully support the agricultural production movement.

    南昌专区动员手工业支援春耕
    本报南昌17日电　江西南昌专区各县地方工业部门，为贯彻地方工业为农村经济服务的方针，动员一切力量，支援春耕生产。
    萍乡、宜春、丰城、清江、南昌、高安等县委工业部门抽调了工业、手工业管理部门的干部，组织工作组到农村作典型调查访问，了解农民需要，征求农民各个农事季节需要农具的产品规格、质量、数量的意见和要求。根据各县调查访问，今年农民所需要的农具，特别是小型农具，不论是修理与新制比去年都有所增加。
    据萍乡县福田社的调查，今年需要新制的小型农具比去年要增加两倍。各县的工业部门、工厂企业、手工业合作社，在调查访问与了解了农民的需要后，有的工厂企业和手工业合作社已订出了生产农具的计划，有的与农业社签订了产销合同，有的在积极准备原材料。仅宜春县就有十二个铁、木、竹手工业社与农业社签订了产销合同七十二件，新制各种大小农具二万六千零八十五件。新建、宜丰、靖安、铜鼓等县，到目前为止，手工业合作社已给农民修理与制造了各种铁、木、竹大小农具一万七千四百余件。
    中共南昌地委工业交通部要求各县工业交通局，手工业管理局加强政治思想领导，切实教育职工、社员群众，树立为农业生产服务的思想，批判那种“只顾赚钱，不顾质量”和“偷工减料、粗制滥造”的资本主义经营作风。要求产品质量做到三包“包用、包修、包来回”；整理并建立农具修配站。组织社员下乡，帮助修理农具，做到“新农具有供应，旧农具修理及时”，不误农时，全力支援农业生产运动。
