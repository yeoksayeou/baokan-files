Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 25th: The Rural Work Conference convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, through a comprehensive summary of rural work in 1956 and an analysis and study of the current new situation in the countryside, greatly strengthened the confidence of the cadres attending the meeting in striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. The conference also formulated the guidelines, tasks, and measures for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

The conference used an exceptionally rich array of facts to powerfully criticize the current error of some people's insufficient understanding of the superiority of agricultural cooperativization, and therefore their lack of sufficient confidence in continuing to consolidate and improve agricultural cooperatives to strive for a bumper harvest this year. The conference pointed out that last year, in the first year of achieving agricultural cooperativization, with the organizational and economic foundations of most agricultural cooperatives being very weak, and despite being continuously attacked by various natural disasters, the total output of grain and cotton in the province still increased compared to the bumper year of 1955. This fact vividly confirms that agricultural cooperativization is the most reliable path to ensure increased agricultural production. The income of most cooperative members in the province increased significantly. Even in the severely affected areas of Xinxiang Prefecture, over 59% of cooperative members increased their income. In addition, the average general agricultural cooperative in the province accumulated more than 7,000 yuan worth of public property last year. During the winter consolidation of agricultural cooperatives last year, various places universally implemented the system of contracting work and output, and established and improved the internal financial management system. These are all favorable conditions that did not exist in last year's production, and are of great significance for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

In summarizing last year's agricultural production, the conference also emphasized the tremendous achievements of the province in promoting agricultural technology reform and farmland water conservancy construction. For example, in nine counties, including Nanyang, Xinye, and Dengxian, where cotton production has always been very low, last year they focused on helping farmers improve cotton planting techniques, resulting in a more than doubling of cotton production per mu compared to 1955. Shangqiu Prefecture seized the measure of transforming low-yield crops into high-yield crops. The 480,000 mu of corn newly promoted last year yielded an average of 40 to 80 jin more per mu than the original planting of sorghum. In terms of farmland water conservancy construction, the province actively promoted well-drilling, spring tapping, and small reservoir construction last year, increasing the average irrigated land per farmer by more than six fen; of the 1.04 million new wells drilled in the province, only 50,000 were truly abandoned. The conference criticized the current tendency of some people to one-sidedly exaggerate the shortcomings in promoting agricultural technology reform and farmland water conservancy construction last year, and to endlessly criticize errors and find fault. It demanded that rural work cadres throughout the province earnestly summarize and absorb last year's experiences and lessons, and strive to win greater victories in this year's agricultural technology reform and farmland water conservancy construction.

The cadres attending the meeting unanimously agreed to the Henan Province's 1957 agricultural production plan proposed by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The plan stipulates that the province will produce 28.5 billion jin of grain (including soybeans), 4.2 million dan of cotton (lint), and 9.5 million dan of oil crops, an increase of approximately 9%, 25%, and 34% respectively compared to last year's output; livestock (excluding pigs) will be developed to 7.45 million head, and pigs will be developed to 6 million head, an increase of approximately 6% and 66% respectively compared to last year. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also proposed striving to reach or exceed the level of local well-to-do middle peasants in the income of cooperative members of all agricultural cooperatives in the province in about three years. The cadres attending the meeting also expressed their determination to work hard to achieve this goal. Many county cadres further explored the potential for increased production at the meeting, automatically revised the original production targets that were too low, and also wanted to cultivate a group of agricultural cooperatives with large-scale high yields of grain, cotton, and other crops. Cadres in areas with significant production increases last year or consecutive years of bumper harvests changed their past negative thinking that "they had already reached their peak and there was no more production to increase." Cadres in areas that had been affected by disasters for many years or were severely affected last year also reversed their past pessimistic mood that there were many difficulties in disaster areas and there was no guarantee of increased production.

The meeting believes that it is currently necessary to earnestly educate the whole Party and the people of the province to deeply understand the great political significance and favorable conditions for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. It is necessary to continue to launch a vigorous propaganda campaign centered on publicizing and mobilizing production, so that the various indicators and measures of this year's agricultural production in the province truly reach every household, in order to further mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of farmers and rural work cadres; and it is necessary to adhere to the implementation of production as the center, continue to consolidate agricultural cooperatives, improve the management of agricultural cooperatives and strengthen political and ideological work within the cooperatives, and strive to earnestly solve the problems of backward agricultural cooperatives within one year. The meeting also put forward five specific criteria for measuring whether an agricultural cooperative is consolidated: 1. The Party organization within the cooperative can play a core role, has a strong leading backbone, and has established the leading advantage of poor peasants; 2. Cooperative members have a high level of socialist consciousness and have established the idea of ​​taking the cooperative as their home; 3. The cooperative's management has been put on the right track in accordance with the model charter of advanced agricultural cooperatives; 4. Labor productivity has been improved, production has increased significantly, the cooperative has relatively more public accumulation, and the income of cooperative members has reached or exceeded the level of well-to-do middle peasants; 5. The task of eliminating illiteracy has been basically completed, and the cultural and technical level of cooperative members has been generally improved. The meeting demanded that rural work cadres throughout the province continue to work hard and in-depth, and strive to truly consolidate agricultural cooperatives throughout the province in three to five years.

The conference started on the 12th and ended on the 21st. More than 1,800 people attended the meeting, including secretaries of local Party committees, county Party committee secretaries, heads of rural work departments, heads of finance and trade departments, commissioners, heads of agricultural sections, heads of water conservancy sections, and Party committee (branch) secretaries of key townships and cooperatives in various counties.

    河南农村工作会议研究了农村新形势
    提出争取大丰收的方针和任务
    新华社郑州25日电　中共河南省委员会召开的农村工作会议，通过全面总结1956年的农村工作，分析和研究目前农村的新形势，大大坚定了到会干部对于争取今年农业大丰收的信心。会议还制定了争取今年农业大丰收的方针、任务和措施。
    会议以异常丰富的事实，有力地批评了当前有一些人对于农业合作化的优越性认识不足，因而对于继续整顿提高农业社争取今年大丰收缺乏足够信心的错误。会议指出，去年全省在实现农业合作化的第一年，大部农业社的组织基础和经济基础都很薄弱的情况下，连续受到多种自然灾害的袭击，但是全省粮、棉总产量仍都比丰收的1955年有所增加。这一事实生动地证实了农业合作化是保证增加农业生产的最可靠的道路。全省大部分社员收入显著增加。新乡专区的重灾地区，也有59％强的社员 增加了收入。此外，全省一般农业社去年平均积累了价值在七千元以上的公共财产。在去年冬季整顿农业社中，各地普遍推行了包工包产制，建立和健全了社内的财务管理制度。这些都是去年生产中所没有的有利条件，对于争取今年农业大丰收有很大的意义。
    在总结去年农业生产的过程中，会议还强调指出了全省推行农业技术改革和农田水利建设的巨大成就。例如，棉花产量一向很低的南阳、新野、邓县等九个县，去年抓紧帮助农民改进植棉技术，结果使每亩棉花产量比1955年提高了一倍多。商丘专区抓住变低产作物为高产作物的措施，去年新推广的四十八万亩玉米，平均每亩比原来种植高粱多收了四十斤到八十斤。在农田水利建设方面，去年全省积极推行打井、下泉和修小水库等，使每个农民平均增加了六分多水地；全省新打的一百零四万眼水井中，真正的废井只有五万眼。会议批评了当前有一些人片面夸大去年推行农业技术改革和农田水利建设中的缺点，而一味评头品足和无休止地指责错误，并且要求全省农村工作干部认真地总结和吸取去年的经验教训，争取在今年的农业技术改革和农田水利建设中赢得更大的胜利。
    到会干部一致同意中共河南省委员会提出的河南省1957年农业生产计划。计划规定，全省产粮食（包括大豆）二百八十五亿斤、棉花四百二十万担（皮棉）、油料九百五十万担，分别比去年产量大约增加9％、25％、34％；牲畜（不包括猪）发展到七百四十五万头、猪发展到六百万头，分别比去年大约增加6％和66％。中共河南省委员会还提出，争取在三年左右的时间，使全省所有农业社的社员收入基本上达到或超过当地富裕中农的水平。到会干部也都表示要努力实现这个目标。不少县的干部在会上进一步挖掘增产潜力，自动修正了原来过低的生产指标，并且要培养一批粮食、棉花等大面积丰产的农业社。去年增产很多或者连续几年丰收的地区的干部，改变了过去认为“已经顶上开花、无产可增”的消极思想。连年受灾和去年受灾较重的地区的干部，也扭转了过去认为灾区困难多，增产没有保证的悲观情绪。
    会议认为，当前要认真地教育全党和全省人民深刻认识争取今年农业大丰收的重大政治意义和有利条件，要继续深入展开一个大张旗鼓地以宣传动员生产为中心的宣传运动，使今年全省农业生产的各项指标和措施真正达到家喻户晓，以进一步调动广大农民群众和农村工作干部的积极性和创造性；并且要坚持贯彻以生产为中心，继续整顿巩固农业社，以提高农业社的经营管理和加强社内的政治思想工作，争取在一年内认真解决落后农业社的问题。会议还提出了具体衡量一个农业社是否巩固的五条标准：一、社内党组织能起核心作用，有坚强领导骨干，确立了贫农的领导优势；二、社员有高度的社会主义觉悟，树立了以社为家的思想；三、社的经营管理已经按高级农业社示范章程走上了正轨；四、提高了劳动生产率，生产有显著增加，社内有比较多的公共积累，社员收入已经达到或超过了富裕中农的水平；五、基本上完成了扫除文盲的任务，普遍提高了社员的文化和技术水平。会议要求全省农村工作干部继续艰苦深入工作，争取在三、五年内使全省农业社真正得到巩固。
    这次会议从12日开始，到21日结束。参加会议的有全省各地委书记、县委书记、农村工作部长、财贸部长、专员、农业科长、水利科长和各县重点乡、社的党委（支部）书记等共一千八百多人。
