    匈牙利经济情况继续好转
    据新华社布达佩斯3日电　匈牙利全国各煤矿区在1月份共采煤一百二十三万八千三百七十七吨，完成了预定计划的108.1％。
    这几天，匈牙利的煤产量平均每天增长一千七百七十多吨，已经达到去年十月事件前平均日产量的85％左右。1月31日这一天，共产煤五万八千四百七十吨，这是去年十月事件以来的最高产量。
    煤矿工人的数目也在不断增加，据重工业部最近的统计，全国矿工已有八万三千多人，相当于去年十月事件前的88％以上。
    匈牙利国家计划局局长阿·基什最近在一次记者招待会上说，最近几星期，匈牙利工业生产和国家全部经济生活的主要问题是煤和电力的供应问题。由于采煤量的增长，电力供应的情况也好转了。他说，通货膨胀的危险是可以避免的。现在匈牙利具有提高商品产量的一切条件。消费品的生产已快达到去年的水平。
