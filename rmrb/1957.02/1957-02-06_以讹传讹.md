Passing on Errors
    Not long ago, a wave of purchasing fish scales swept through the rural areas of Fenjie District, Maoming County, Guangdong Province. Here's how it happened: The county supply and marketing cooperative issued a notice in September of last year regarding the purchase of local and waste products. The Fenjie District purchasing station reprinted this notice and sent it down as publicity material. However, Huang Guanglan, a purchasing agent at this station, mistakenly wrote the purchase price of fish scales as 1.59 yuan per jin (斤) instead of 15.9 yuan per dan (担) when reprinting. Mai Pei, a purchasing agent at the Renli purchasing station in Datang Township, received this document and began purchasing fish scales according to it without checking.

    The news that selling fish scales was highly profitable spread quickly. Farmers in Datang Township requested certificates from township cadres to transport and sell fish scales, and some even went to Shuidong Town in Dianbai County, more than sixty li away, to snap them up. To buy fish scales, some people even sold their rations and chickens. December 20th was market day in Renli, and so many people came to the purchasing station to sell fish scales that the purchasing agent couldn't keep up. Li Yuming, the director of the distribution cooperative, felt suspicious when he saw this scene and asked Mai Pei to double-check the original notice from the higher authorities. This check revealed the terrible truth! The purchase price was nine times higher than it should have been! Several hundred jin of fish scales had been purchased, resulting in an immediate loss of more than 500 yuan. Stop purchasing? Impossible. Change to the correct price according to the higher authorities? Also impossible. The fish scales were painstakingly collected from distant places at high prices by the farmers; doing so would be cheating them. In the end, they had to pay the farmers a price slightly higher than the official price.

    This mistake could have easily been found. For example, someone saw that the price of fish scales was so shockingly high and felt something was amiss, but others replied matter-of-factly: "This stuff is extremely useful." Meaning: it should be that expensive. However, for several months, no one bothered to check the original notice from the higher authorities.

    This incident may seem like a mere accident; however, aren't many of the seemingly accidental disasters in daily life precisely caused by people's carelessness and assumptions?

    以讹传讹
    不久以前，广东省茂名县分界区的农村里发生了一场关于收购鱼鳞的风潮。事情是这样的：县供销合作社在去年9月发出了关于收购土产品和废品的通知，分界区收购站把这份通知翻印后当作宣传资料又发到下面去。但是，这个站的收购员黄广兰在翻印的时候，把鱼鳞的收购价每担十五元九角写成每斤一元五角九分。大塘乡仁里收购站收购员麦沛接到这份资料后，不加查对，就按照它收购起鱼鳞来了。
    卖鱼鳞有厚利可图的消息，很快传开了。大塘乡的农民纷纷要求乡干部给开证明出去贩运鱼鳞，有些人到六十里以外的电白县水东镇去抢购鱼鳞。为了收买鱼鳞，有些人甚至把口粮、小鸡都卖出去了。12月20日，是仁里的墟期，到收购站门前卖鱼鳞的人多得使收购员应接不暇。分销社主任李毓铭看见这般情景，心里疑惑，叫麦沛再核对一下上级通知的原文。这一核对，可糟了！原来收购价高出了九倍！鱼鳞收购了几百斤，眼前就损失五百多元。停止收购吗？不成。改按上级的正确牌价收购吗？也不成。鱼鳞是农民辛辛苦苦从远地用高价收买来的，如果那样做，就坑了农民了。最后只好付给农民比正式牌价高一些的价钱。
    这个差错本来是很容易查出来的。比如，有人看到鱼鳞价格高得这样惊人，觉得其中有些蹊跷，但是，另外的人却想当然地回答说：“这东西顶有用。”意思是说：理应这么贵。但是，好几个月里，谁也不肯去查一查上级通知的原文。
    这场风波，看来好像不过是一次偶然的事件；可是，日常生活里有好多看来像是偶然的祸害，不恰恰就是人们的粗心大意和想当然的作风造成的吗？
