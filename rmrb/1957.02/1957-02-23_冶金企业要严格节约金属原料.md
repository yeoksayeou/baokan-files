Metallurgical Enterprises Must Strictly Conserve Metal Raw Materials
Yu Bing

A rather prominent difficulty in the metal smelting industry at present is the shortage of various metal raw materials. This not only affects the further increase in the production of various metal materials, but also seriously affects the exploitation of the potential of the equipment of metal smelting enterprises themselves. The ways to overcome this difficulty are not only to actively strive to create conditions, accelerate mine construction, and strengthen the recovery of waste metal by various departments using metal materials, to provide sufficient ore and waste metal to meet the needs of metal smelting enterprises, but also for metal smelting enterprises themselves to strictly conserve the consumption of metal raw materials, which is an important aspect of overcoming the shortage of raw materials and achieving increased metal production.

In recent years, various metal smelting enterprises have generally paid more attention to conserving the consumption of metal raw materials and have achieved certain results. For example, in steelmaking, from 1953 to 1956, the average amount of materials used per ton of steel produced by open-hearth furnaces and electric furnaces has been reduced by 60 to 70 kilograms. In 1956, the reduction in raw material consumption alone resulted in the production of nearly 100,000 tons of additional steel for the country. Some non-ferrous metal smelting plants have also achieved significant results. In 1953, the Shenyang Smelting Plant could only produce 94.8 kilograms of copper for every 100 kilograms of raw materials input, but by 1956, it was able to produce 96.13 kilograms of copper.

However, in various metal smelting departments, the consumption of metal raw materials is extremely unbalanced between factories and between workshops, and the difference is very large. The materials used by some factories have been reduced to below the consumption quota, while the materials used by some factories far exceed the consumption quota. The materials used to make one ton of steel in open-hearth furnaces have been reduced to 1,020 kilograms (referring to the exclusion of ore, including only pig iron and waste metal); the lowest has been reduced to 990 kilograms; while some are still above 1,070 kilograms. The materials used to make one ton of steel in electric furnaces have been reduced to 1,105 kilograms; while some are still above 1,150 kilograms. The materials used in converter steelmaking not only did not decrease in 1956 compared with 1955, but the average amount of raw materials used per ton of steel increased by 15 kilograms. The Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant only needs 1,195 kilograms of materials per ton of converter steel, while the national average is more than 1,240 kilograms. In steel rolling mills, merely after heat treatment, 30 kilograms of steel are lost per ton, and some factories even lose 70 to 80 kilograms. Including the losses in the electrolysis process, the copper recovery rate of the Shenyang Smelting Plant's copper smelting workshop can still reach more than 95.5%, while the copper recovery rate of the Tongguanshan Smelting Plant's crude copper smelting, which does not have an electrolysis process loss, can only reach 92%. The Kunming Smelting Plant uses crude lead with a lead content of more than 90% to refine refined lead, but the loss rate is still more than 25%. If these enterprises with high raw material loss rates generally reach the level of advanced enterprises, a lot of raw materials can be saved and a lot of metal can be produced.

The facts of many factories prove that as long as the leading personnel of the smelting enterprises pay full attention to it, it is possible to further reduce the consumption and loss of metal raw materials. The facts of the electric furnace workshop of the Benxi Steel Plant are an example. This plant did not complete the state-stipulated raw material consumption quota in 1954 and 1955. Later, after the plant's leading personnel conducted in-depth inspections, carefully studied the reasons for the excessive raw material consumption, and relied on employees to come up with ideas and methods to solve a series of problems in operation, batching, and labor organization, the raw material consumption from January to April 1956 fell from an average of 1,163 kilograms per ton of steel in 1955 to 1,108 kilograms and 1,105 kilograms, with the lowest reaching 1,095 kilograms. In 1955, the raw material consumption per ton of steel in the 50-ton open-hearth furnace of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company was 4 kilograms more than that of Taiyuan Steel Plant. Due to their efforts, the material consumption per ton of steel in 1956 was 22 kilograms less than the best month of Taiyuan Steel Plant. The Shenyang Smelting Plant's electrolytic zinc workshop originally planned to recover 88 catties of zinc from every 100 catties of raw materials. Recently, when mobilizing employees to review this year's production plan draft, veteran workers and technicians increased the recovery rate to 88.84 kilograms through measurement, which alone can increase the production of zinc worth more than 37,000 yuan a year. If Benxi Steel Plant, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and Shenyang Smelting Plant can do it, why can't other similar plants do it?

It is said that some leading personnel still believe that saving metal raw materials is "not a priority," and saving metal raw materials is still considered an insignificant task. Many factories often only pay one-sided attention to smelting "more" and smelting "faster," and only emphasize speeding up the smelting time, but rarely consider or do not consider at all how to save more metal raw materials to increase production. Although many factories have proposed to pay attention to the conservation of metal raw materials, they are still in a state of no one being responsible. Administrative management personnel regard it as the matter of technical personnel, technical personnel believe that it is the matter of raw material supply staff, and raw material supply staff regard this work as a cost issue, which belongs to the matter of accounting staff. The result of such irresponsibility and mutual buck-passing has seriously affected the development of the work of saving metal raw materials.

It should be seen that further reducing the consumption of metal raw materials and minimizing the loss of metal raw materials can not only promote the improvement of the management level of metal smelting plants from the existing basis, but also is an important way for metal smelting enterprises themselves to overcome the current shortage of raw materials and achieve further increase in production. According to existing materials, if all our smelting plants can attach importance to this work and find ways to overcome excessive raw material consumption, so that the material consumption per ton of steel in open-hearth furnaces can be reduced by another 20 kilograms, the material consumption per ton of steel in electric furnaces can be reduced by another 25 kilograms, and the material consumption per ton of steel in converters can be reduced by another 30 kilograms, and the advanced experience of negative tolerance steel rolling is earnestly and universally promoted, then, without increasing raw materials, at least more than 100,000 tons of steel can be supplied to the country every year. Various non-ferrous metals also have the same potential for increased production.

At present, the employees of various metal smelting enterprises are reviewing and revising this year's production plan. It is hoped that everyone can further analyze and study the consumption and loss of metals, so as to find practical and feasible ways to save more metal raw materials and produce more steel and non-ferrous metal materials to meet the needs of the country.

    冶金企业要严格节约金属原料
    于冰
    在金属冶炼工业中，当前一个比较突出的困难，是各种金属原料不足。这不仅影响了各种金属材料的进一步增产，并且严重地影响了金属冶炼企业本身设备潜力的发挥。克服这一困难的办法，除了积极努力创造条件，加速矿山建设，加强各使用金属材料部门对废旧金属的回收工作，提供充足的矿石和废旧金属，以满足金属冶炼企业的需要以外，金属冶炼企业本身严格地节约金属原料的消耗，是克服原料不足和达到增产金属的一个重要方面。
    近几年来，各个金属冶炼企业，对于节约金属原料消耗，一般是比较重视的，也收到了一定的效果。例如在炼钢方面，从1953年到1956年，平炉和电炉炼每吨钢的用料，平均已减少六十到七十公斤。1956年，仅是原料消耗量降低部分，就给国家多生产了近十万吨钢。部分有色金属冶炼工厂，也同样收到了显著成绩。沈阳冶炼厂在1953年，每投入一百公斤原料，只能炼出九十四点八公斤铜，到1956年，已经能炼出九十六点一三公斤铜。
    然而，在各金属冶炼部门中，厂与厂之间，车间与车间之间，金属原料消耗量是极不平衡的，而且相差很远。有些厂的用料，已减少到消耗定额以下，而有些厂的用料却远远超过消耗定额。平炉炼每吨钢的用料，有的已减少到一千零二十公斤（指不包括矿石，只包括生铁和废旧金属）；最低的已减少到九百九十公斤；而有的却仍然在一千零七十公斤以上。电炉炼每吨钢的用料，有的已减少到一千一百零五公斤；而有的却仍在一千一百五十公斤以上。转炉炼钢的用料，1956年不但没比1955年降低，平均每吨钢反而多用了十五公斤原料。上海钢铁一厂每吨转炉钢只要一千一百九十五公斤，而全国平均每吨转炉钢的用料却在一千二百四十公斤以上。在轧钢厂，仅是经过加热处理，每吨钢就要损失三十公斤，有的厂甚至要损失七、八十公斤。沈阳冶炼厂炼铜车间加上电解过程中损耗在内，收得率仍能达到95.5％以上，而铜官山冶炼厂炼粗铜没有电解的过程损耗，收得率反只能达到92％。昆明冶炼厂利用已经含铅在90％以上的粗铅炼精铅，但损耗率仍在25％以上。如果这些原料损耗率高的企业普遍达到先进企业的水平，那就可以节约许多原料，增产许多金属。
    不少厂的事实证明，只要冶炼企业领导人员充分重视，金属原料消耗量和损失量再降低一些是可能的。本溪炼钢厂电炉车间的事实，就是一个例证。这个厂在1954年和1955年中，都没有完成国家规定的原料消耗定额，后来经过这个厂的领导人员深入检查，仔细研究了原料消耗过高的原因，依靠职工出主意想办法，从操作上，配料上，以及劳动组织上解决了一系列的问题以后，1956年1至4月份的原料消耗量，从1955年平均每吨钢的用料一千一百六十三公斤，下降到一千一百零八公斤、一千一百零五公斤，最低的达到一千零九十五公斤。重庆钢铁公司的五十吨平炉，在1955年每吨钢的原料消耗量比太原钢厂要多用四公斤，由于他们的努力，1956年每吨钢的用料，比太原钢厂最好的月份还要少用二十二公斤。沈阳冶炼厂电解锌车间，原来计划每百斤原料收得八十八斤锌，最近在发动职工审查今年生产计划草案时，老工人和技术人员们通过测算，把收得率提高到八十八点八四公斤，仅这一项一年就可以增产价值三万七千多元的锌。本溪钢厂、重庆钢铁公司、沈阳冶炼厂能作到的事，其他同类的厂为什么不能作到呢？
    据说，至今仍有某些领导人员，对节约金属原料的工作认为“排不上队”，节约金属原料仍然被认为是无足轻重的工作。不少厂往往只片面地注意炼得“多”炼得“快”，只强调加快冶炼时间，对如何更多的节约金属原料以增加生产，则很少考虑，或根本不考虑。有不少厂虽然提出要注意金属原料的节约，但至今仍流于无人负责状态。行政管理人员把它看成是技术人员的事，技术人员认为是原料供应工作人员的事，而原料供应工作人员又把这一工作看成是成本问题，属于会计工作人员的事。这样无人负责，互相推诿的结果，就严重地影响了节约金属原料这一工作的开展。
    应该看到，进一步降低金属原料的消耗，最大限度地减少金属原料的损失，不仅能促使金属冶炼工厂管理水平从现有基础上提高一步，同时也是金属冶炼企业本身克服当前原料不足、达到进一步增产的一个重要途径。根据现有材料计算，如果我们所有的冶炼厂都能重视这一工作，找出克服原料消耗过多的办法，平均使平炉炼每吨钢的用料再减少二十公斤，电炉炼每吨钢的用料再减少二十五公斤，转炉炼每吨钢的用料再减少三十公斤，并认真地普遍地推行负公差轧钢的先进经验，那末，在不增加原料的情形下，每年至少还可以多供给国家十余万吨钢。各种有色金属也同样有可能做到增产。
    目前，各金属冶炼企业的职工，都在审查和修改今年的生产计划，希望大家能把金属的消耗和损失情况，作进一步的分析研究，从而找出切实可行的办法，节约更多的金属原料，生产更多的钢铁和有色金属材料，以满足国家的需要。
