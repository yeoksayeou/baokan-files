Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 2nd: The Polish Council of Ministers passed the draft of the 1957 National Economic Plan on January 31st. This draft plan will be submitted to the next parliament for approval.

The draft plan stipulates that the total industrial output value in 1957 will increase by 4.2% compared to 1956, a lower growth rate than in 1956.

The draft states that industrial investment has remained roughly at the same level for the past three years, and the implementation of investment tasks in 1956 was delayed in some important projects. This year's supply of industrial raw materials must not only meet the needs of increased production, but also ensure increased reserves. This year's plan has a greater possibility of overfulfillment than last year's (the 1956 plan was overfulfilled by 2.7%).

The 1957 plan aims to produce 93 million tons of coal. Pig iron production will increase by 6.7% compared to last year, steel by 7.2%, and steel materials by 7.1%. Compared to 1956, electricity will increase by 11%, the machinery manufacturing industry will increase by 6.3%, the chemical industry will increase by 14.3%, and the light industry will increase by 5.6%. Handicraft industry will have a great development. Agricultural production will increase by 3.5%.

The national income in 1957 will increase by 4.7% compared to last year. The wages of workers and the income of farmers will increase to some extent.

    新华社华沙2日电　波兰部长会议在1月31日通过了1957年国民经济计划草案。这一计划草案将提交下届议会批准。
    计划草案规定，1957年工业总产值将比1956年增加4.2％，这个增长比率低于1956年。
