Golden Thread Tune
To a Friend and His Family in America, Urging Them to Return

When will we meet again? Such a mood, with ambition waning, lingering long in a foreign land. Eight years have slipped by in dreams abroad, soon seeing your prime years wasted. You should pity the children at your knee, who know so little of their homeland, let alone those who have never spoken a word of their ancestral Chinese tongue. Their education and upbringing are truly a cause for concern!

Friends and relatives are adding to your worries, composing new verses with heartfelt, earnest words, sending them to you with diligence. Only by turning back can you reach the shore; do not fear the wide waves and deep waters. The motherland is blooming everywhere, with a tapestry of mountains and rivers displaying the myriad facets of spring. Waiting for your return, we will sing and dance together. Do not delay the date of your return again!

    金缕曲
    友人全家在美寄词促归
      钱昌照
    何日重相聚？甚心情消沉壮志，异邦久住。八载悠悠海外梦，行见盛年孤负。应怜惜膝前儿女，少小不知乡国事，况之无未识先胡语。教与养，真堪虑！亲朋为尔添愁绪，制新词心长语重，殷勤寄与。但得回头便是岸，浪阔水深毋惧。正祖国花开处处，锦绣山河春万象，待归来与尔同歌舞。莫再把，归期误！
