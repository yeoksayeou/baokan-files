    Xingtai Area Does a Good Job in Winter Livestock Protection
    The Phenomenon of Weak and Dead Livestock Has Been Basically Reversed
    (Our Newspaper Reporter Wang Lin reports) Xingtai Special District, Hebei Province, has taken some effective measures in livestock protection work, basically reversing the phenomenon of weak and dead livestock in some agricultural cooperatives during the rapid development of agricultural cooperation at the beginning of last year, and the phenomenon of farmers indiscriminately slaughtering and selling livestock after suffering from floods last autumn. In addition to using various methods to educate farmers to recognize the importance of livestock protection for developing production, party and government leading organs in the Xingtai area have also taken many measures.
    Xingtai area is a cotton-producing area, and there are not many feeding grasslands. In addition, the floods last year were severe, and feed grass was even more scarce. Therefore, after the disaster, all counties universally mobilized the masses to seize the time to collect and store feed. Each agricultural cooperative, according to the amount of grass shortage, the amount of labor, and the busy and slack seasons of farm work, separately stipulates the method of paying cash or recording work points to pay the remuneration of grass-cutting personnel, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the members to cut grass and solve the living difficulties of the members. Now, the hay that has been cut and the fallen leaves that have been collected in this area can basically feed the livestock.
    In order to ensure that livestock can safely survive the winter, the counties have repaired the collapsed livestock sheds. According to statistics from thirteen counties including Longyao, Julu, and Qinghe, most of the collapsed livestock sheds have been repaired.
    In order to ensure that draught animals are regularly protected, in addition to making many improvements to the methods of feeding and management, the agricultural cooperatives in this area have also established and improved the system of using livestock, so as to prevent members from disregarding cherishing livestock in order to earn more work points. The Ximeng Village Cooperative in Julu County has set a daily usage quota based on the size, strength, and speed of work of the livestock, and is not allowed to exceed the quota standard. After the establishment of the handover system in the Datuntou Township Agricultural Cooperative in Julu County, the members who use the livestock exchange information about the livestock with the feeders at any time, so that the livestock can be used appropriately, and if the livestock becomes ill, it can be treated in time.
    In the severely affected areas, methods such as foster care, grazing, and transportation have been adopted to ensure that livestock is properly fed, and to achieve "raising livestock with livestock and raising people with livestock." For example, Longyao, Ningjin and other counties drove more than one hundred head of livestock to Neiqiu, Lincheng and other places with more pasture to graze, and also drew a part of the livestock to engage in transportation sideline occupations. The income from this sideline occupation can not only buy feed, but also help members solve their living difficulties.

    邢台地区冬季保畜工作做得好
    牲畜瘦弱伤亡现象已经基本扭转
    本报讯　本报记者王林报道：河北省邢台专区在保畜工作上采取了一些有效的措施，基本上扭转了去年年初农业合作化迅速发展当中部分农业社牲畜瘦弱伤亡和去秋遭受水灾后农民滥宰滥卖牲畜的现象。邢台地区的党政领导机关，除了运用各种办法教育农民认识保畜工作对发展生产的重要意义以外，还采取了许多措施。
    邢台地区是产棉区，饲草原不多，加上去年水灾严重，饲草更加缺乏。因此，在受灾后各县即普遍发动群众抓紧打草贮备饲料。各个农业社根据缺草数量、劳动力多少、农活忙闲等情况，分别规定用付现款或记工分的办法付给打草人员的报酬，以激发社员打草的积极性，和解决社员的生活困难。现在，这个地区所打割的干草和收集的落叶，基本上可以够喂牲畜。
    为了保证牲畜安全过冬，各县对倒塌的牲口棚进行了修复。据隆尧、巨鹿、清河等十三个县统计，倒塌的牲口棚已大部修好。
    为使耕畜受到经常的保护，这个地区的农业社除了对饲养管理方法作了许多改进以外，还建立和健全了使用牲口的制度，以免社员为了多挣工分不顾爱惜牲口。巨鹿县西孟村社根据牲口大小、强弱、作活快慢等条件，定出每天使用定额，不准超过定额标准。巨鹿县大屯头乡农业社，建立交接制度后，使用牲口的社员同饲养员随时交换牲口情况，使牲口能够得到适当的使用，如果牲口有了病，也能得到及时治疗。
    在重灾区采取了寄养、放牧和搞运输等办法，使牲口得到适当的饲养，并且作到了“以畜养畜、以畜养人”。如隆尧、宁晋等县，赶了一百多头牲畜到内丘、临城等地牧草较多的地方去放牧，并且还抽出一部分牲口去搞运输副业，在这项副业中所得的收入，不但可以买饲草，而且还可以帮助社员解决生活困难。
