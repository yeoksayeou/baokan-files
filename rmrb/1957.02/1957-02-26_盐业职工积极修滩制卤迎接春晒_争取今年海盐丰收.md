Salt industry workers actively repair salt pans and prepare brine to welcome spring sunning
    Striving for a bumper harvest of sea salt this year
    (Our dispatch) In less than a month, the national sea salt spring sunning season will begin. Workers in the sea salt areas are busy preparing for the spring sunning, striving for a bumper harvest of sea salt this year.
    Sea salt production in our country accounts for more than 85% of the total salt production in the country and is the main source for increasing salt production. Except for the Guangdong and Fujian salt areas, which can produce year-round, other salt areas have switched to preparing for this year's production since the end of autumn sunning last winter. The main tasks are repairing the salt pans (production sites) and preparing brine (raw materials). Salt fields with saltpeter production tasks are also carrying out frozen saltpeter work at the same time. In the brine production work, the vast number of workers, in order to make full use of the low temperatures, carry out brine extraction under the ice, often persisting in their work in the freezing cold. The Donglaotan salt production area of ​​the Piziwo Salt Farm in Liaoning Province suffered a sixteen-millimeter snowstorm on December 6 last year, and the only water delivery route in the entire area was frozen. In order to complete the brine cultivation plan, more than fifty young workers spontaneously organized an ice-breaking commando team, and within two days, they completely removed all the ice in the water delivery channel, which was more than 400 meters long, 2 meters wide, and more than 10 centimeters thick. As of the beginning of February, the total brine volume in key sea salt areas such as Liaoning, Hangu, Changlu Tangda, Shandong, and Huaibei has completed more than 99% of the winter preparation and brine production plan, an increase of 3.76% compared with the same period last year. Among them, the brine production work in the Changlu Tangda and Hangu areas has been done faster, and the increase in brine water at all levels is also relatively balanced. All areas have attached more importance to the repair of salt pans than in previous years. The leadership has grasped it tightly and started early, so the quantity and quality of salt pan repairs have improved compared with previous years. In terms of saltpeter production, Changlu Tangda and Huaibei have completed their tasks, and Hangu has completed 87% as of the beginning of February. Glauber's salt is a chemical raw material, and workers sweep the salt in the morning when the temperature is lowest to supply the needs of the country.
    Now, the preparation work for spring sunning has entered a new stage with climate change. The Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Food Industry has instructed all salt fields to pay attention to arranging the next step of work while doing a good job in production preparation, especially to do a good job in the treatment of ice-melting water and the repair of salt pan ponds. Salt ponds that are repaired flat and compacted can reduce brine seepage losses and increase brine concentration, which is an important measure to increase salt production. Therefore, the Salt Affairs Bureau requires all fields to pump and compress 50%-80% of the evaporation ponds to lay a good material foundation for spring sunning.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 25th: This year, the five salt farms in Jinzhou, Fuzhouwan, Wudao, Jinzhou, and Yingkou in Liaoning Province plan to increase sea salt production by 130,000 tons compared with last year without increasing equipment, manpower, and investment.
    In late December last year, just as the increase production and thrift campaign had begun, salt production encountered serious difficulties. The weather was cold, there was heavy snow, and the tide level was low, making it impossible to take in seawater. Various farms successively lacked water. More than 80% of the more than 600 salt pans in the Yingkou Salt Farm lacked water. Many water circles, water storage ditches, and water cultivation ponds in the Jinzhou Salt Farm were frozen dry, seriously threatening alkali extraction under the ice.
    Under these most difficult circumstances, the salt farm leaders separately convened symposiums with production technicians, experienced old team leaders, advanced producers, and young activists to convey the policy of increasing production and practicing thrift. Through discussions, they clarified the main directions of salt industry production increase and thrift. At the same time, they conducted education among all employees on hard work and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, further improving the enthusiasm of employees for production, and launched an ice-breaking and water-drawing brine cultivation competition on the salt farms.
    Thanks to the tenacious struggle of the salt workers, the bureau had already overfulfilled the February mixed brine production plan by more than double as early as the end of January. The brine produced is expected to produce more than 490,000 tons of sea salt.

    盐业职工积极修滩制卤迎接春晒
    争取今年海盐丰收
    本报讯　不到一个月，全国海盐春晒就要开始了。海盐区职工们正在忙着做好春晒前的准备工作，争取今年海盐丰收。
    我国海盐产量占全国盐的总产量的85％以上，是增产盐的主要依靠。除广东、福建盐区可以常年生产外，其他各盐区自去冬结束秋晒以后，即转入今年生产的准备工作。其中主要的是修滩（生产场地）和制卤（原料），有制硝任务的盐场同时进行冻硝工作。在制卤工作中，广大职工为了充分利用低温，进行冰下抽卤，经常在冰天雪地里坚持工作。辽宁省貔子窝盐场东老滩制盐区，在去年12月6日遭受一次十六公厘大雪的袭击，全区唯一的一条送水路被冰封了。为了完成养卤计划，五十多名青年工人自动组织破冰突击队，两天内把四百多公尺长、二公尺宽、十多公分厚的送水道里的冰全部除净。至2月上旬止，辽宁、汉沽、长芦塘大、山东、淮北等重点海盐区总卤量已经完成冬季准备制卤的计划的99％以上，比去年同期增加3.76％。其中以长芦塘大和汉沽两区的制卤工作做得较快，各级卤水的增长也比较均衡。各区比往年都更重视盐滩的修理工作，领导上抓的紧，动手早，因而修滩的数量和质量都比往年提高。在制硝方面，长芦塘大及淮北两区均已完成任务，汉沽至2月上旬止已完成87％。芒硝是化工原料，工人们在早晨气温最低时进行扫硝，以供应国家需要。
    现在，春晒的准备工作已随着气候的变化进入新的阶段。食品工业部盐务总局已指示各个盐场在作好生产准备工作的同时，还必须注意安排下一步工作，特别是要做好对化冰水的处理和修整滩池工作。滩池修得平，压得实，可以减少卤水渗透损失和提高卤水浓度，是增产盐的一个重要措施。所以，盐务总局要求各场抽压蒸发池50％—80％，给春晒打好物质基础。
    据新华社沈阳25日电　辽宁省金州、复州湾、五岛、锦州、营口五个盐场，今年在不增加设备、人力和投资的条件下，计划比去年增产海盐十三万吨。
    去年12月下旬，增产节约运动刚刚开始，盐业生产就碰到了严重困难，天冷雪大，潮位低，纳不上海水，各场相继缺水。营口盐场六百多付滩，有80％以上缺水。锦州盐场有不少水圈、贮水沟、养水池等被冻涸，严重地威胁冰下抽碱。
    在这种最困难的情况下，盐场领导分别召开了生产技术人员、有经验的老组长、先进生产者、青年积极分子座谈会，传达了增产节约方针，通过讨论明确了盐业增产节约的主要方向；同时，向全体职工进行艰苦奋斗、勤俭办企业的教育，进一步提高了职工的生产积极性，在盐场上展开了破冰引水养卤竞赛。
    由于盐工们的顽强斗争，全局早在1月底就超额一倍完成了2月份的混合卤水生产计划；制出的卤水，预计能产四十九万多吨海盐。
