South American Impressions
	Zhao Feng
		Travels on the Pacific Coast
	A few dozen kilometers from Santiago, on the Pacific coast, lies a picturesque fishing port called San Antonio. This is a typical Latin American place name; the clerics of the colonial era seemed to have assigned every saint in the Bible a domain. The area around San Antonio is full of resorts, with winding coastlines and many beaches suitable for swimming. The famous poet Neruda has a small villa here, and we were passing through this fishing port precisely to visit him.
	On the coast of San Antonio, many vendors sell seafood: fresh grouper and various kinds of clams and crabs. One type of clam, which we call oysters, is best eaten raw. At these roadside stalls, many city dwellers make a special trip here to feast. People stand by the road, pry open the hard shells of the oysters with a knife, cut the connecting bands between the oyster meat and the shell, and squeeze on some fresh lemon juice to eat. Unfamiliar Chilean friends, seeing us distant guests, repeatedly invited us to try it with them. We used these freshly caught oysters from the sea, accompanied by a large glass of Chile's most famous "Casablanca" white wine, which was truly a special flavor.
	Neruda was already waiting for us at the door. On the beach, he loudly called out the name of his Chinese counterparts towards the east. He earnestly told us, "Chile and China are only separated by the Pacific Ocean, they will definitely hear my call." In his house, filled with small nautical objects and various ship models, he added, "The only thing missing in my house is a Chinese ship model. Look, this is Spanish, this is British... but I don't want to correct this defect. Because, the day will soon come when I see a Chinese ship flying the five-star red flag sailing past my window."
	The entire display in Neruda's house consists of objects related to navigation, and the most striking among them is a person-sized wooden statue of a woman. The owner told us: this is an ornament from the keel of a Spanish sailing ship from the early colonial period. This wooden statue has weathered countless storms, and the erosion of wind and rain has made its refined and concise style even more prominent. This is the masterpiece of an anonymous sculptor, and it truly deserves to occupy this proper place in the home of a poet who loves navigation.
	Lunch consisted of large and small plates of raw and cooked seafood, and large and small glasses of red and white wine. The special Chilean beer glasses can hold more than a liter. Hosts and guests ate and drank to their heart's content. After the meal, Mrs. Neruda sang one Chilean folk song after another, many of which were Neruda's verses, but were also recited by every household like traditional folk songs. One drinking song expressed the optimism and boldness of the common people, which made us involuntarily hum along. The host asked the hosts and guests to take turns singing folk songs from their respective countries to accompany the wine, but when we had already racked our brains and had nothing to offer, the host could immediately follow up when we had just finished our finale. If the blood-red sunset over the sea had not attracted everyone's attention, this folk song competition would have been destined for our defeat. At this time, we also remembered that we still had a long journey of nearly a hundred kilometers to leave Santiago, and we had to say goodbye to our hosts.
	The Artistic Life of Santiago
	In the Santiago Art Museum, in addition to the permanent displays, two other exhibitions are being held: one is an exhibition of Chilean painters, and the other is a North American print exhibition.
	The older generation of Chilean painters has achieved great success. Polma's (1855-1908) "Awakening" dramatically expresses the characters' personalities. Lira's (1845-1912) "On the Colonnade" depicts the vibrant colors and bright sunshine of young women.
	In the second Chilean painting exhibition, we were pleased to see several works by our old friend from the Chinese cultural and artistic circles, Van Turennout. One of them is "Portrait of a Chinese Girl," and the other is called "Chinese Landscape." People are amazed by some of the changes in the painter's style in recent times. In his works from three or five years ago, the colors were relatively dark and the images were more tragic. But in recent works, people have seen bright colors and cheerful interest in the painter's brushstrokes. Many Chilean friends said: it seems that the painter's travels in China have not only influenced his brushwork and lines with the influence of traditional Chinese painting, but also the life of New China has given the painter an unforgettable infection. The painting "Portrait of a Chinese Girl" is full of infinite love and confidence. From the child's playful braids and wise eyes, people see strength and hope.
	At the North American print exhibition, we saw a clear contrast between two distinctly different schools of painting: one is a firm realist style, and the other is a deformed modernist style. The former mostly depicts landscapes and life, while the latter mostly depicts abstract themes, many of which either fail to arouse people's aesthetic interest, or simply cannot be understood. We are very surprised to see that even in North America, the tradition of realism is still insisted upon and loved by people. But on the other hand, there are also some people who seem to be too obsessed with the pursuit of new forms of expression and original styles. But if they are indeed skilled artists, sometimes the pursuit of new expression methods can indeed create techniques with a different kind of charm. As for some people who are dedicated to the pursuit and creation of novelty as their sole purpose, this can only be said to be a clever way to avoid arduous labor.
	Leaving the art museum, Chilean friends wanted to take us to listen to a concert by the Chilean Music Association Symphony Orchestra. We were late when we took our seats, and only heard the last piece: Vivaldi's G minor viola concerto. This is a Sunday concert dedicated to popularizing music appreciation, and each seat only costs five pesos (this is only a symbolic fee, because the ticket price for a Chinese art troupe is as high as seven hundred pesos). The conductor of the orchestra is German guest artist Remoned. The orchestra did not slack off in the slightest because it was a popular music concert. German rigor and Latin boldness were combined to create a colorful and vivid performance. Most of the audience were students, young people, and even children. We feel that this approach of popularizing music concerts is worth learning from. Because, the Chilean friend accompanying us told me that many young people have learned to appreciate music and improved their aesthetic taste in this way. Because, the experiences of his own children are the most convincing examples. (To be continued) (Attached picture)

    南美见闻	赵沨
      太平洋岸的旅行
    离圣地亚哥几十公里，在太平洋岸上，有一个风景如画的渔港，名字叫圣安东尼。这是典型的拉丁美洲的地名，殖民时代的教士们差不多给圣经上所有的圣者都封了领邑了。圣安东尼港附近都是休养地，这一带的海岸曲折，很多的沙滩，适合游泳。著名的诗人聂鲁达便有一所小别墅在这里，我们正是去拜访他而经过这个渔港的。
    圣安东尼的海岸上，许多摊贩在贩卖海鲜，新鲜的石斑鱼和各种各样的蚌、蟹。有一种我们叫做蚝的蚌类，是最适宜生吃的。在这些街边的小摊子上，许多城里人专门赶到这里来大嚼一顿。人们就站在路边，用小刀掀开生蚝的硬壳，把蚝肉连结蚌壳的絍带切开，挤上一些鲜柠檬汁就可以吃了。不相识的智利朋友看见我们这些远道的客人，便再三地邀请我们一同和他们尝试一下。我们就用这些刚从海上捞出来的生蚝，送上一大杯智利最著名的“卡萨布兰卡”（白屋）白葡萄酒，真是别有风味。
    聂鲁达早已在门口等着我们。就在沙滩上，他向着东方大声呼唤他的中国同行的名字。他认真地告诉我们：“智利和中国只隔着一个太平洋，他们一定会听见我的呼声的。”在他的摆满了航海的小物件和各种船舶的模型的房子里，他又加上一句：“我这房里就是没有中国船的模型，看，这是西班牙的，这是英国的……但我并不想补充这个缺陷。因为，很快就会有这么一天，我看见挂着五星红旗的中国船，在我这窗口驶过。”
    聂鲁达整个房子的陈列全是和航海有关的物件，而其中最引人注意的是一个人样高的木雕女像。主人告诉我们：这是西班牙初期殖民者所用的帆船龙骨的装饰。这个木雕女像不知经过了多少惊涛骇浪，风雨的侵蚀却使它的洗练、简洁的风格更为显著了。这是无名的雕刻家的杰作，它真该在爱好航海的诗人的家中占据这个应有的地位。
    午餐是大盘小盘生的熟的海味，喝的是大杯小杯红色白色的酒，智利人特有的装啤酒的大杯子可以装一公升还多点。宾主都尽情吃喝着。饭后，聂鲁达夫人一个接着一个地唱着智利的民歌，其中有许多是聂鲁达的诗句，但也和传统的民歌一样的家传户诵了。有一首饮酒歌表现了普通人民的乐观和豪放，使我们也不由得跟着咿呀起来了。主人要求宾主轮流唱各自国家的民歌来侑酒，但当我们已经搜索枯肠无以应对时，主人还能在我们尾声刚住的时候立刻接上去。如果不是大海上血红的落霞引起大家的注意时，这个民歌竞赛会是注定我们要失败了的。这时，我们也才想起来，我们离开圣地亚哥还有着将近百公里的长途，不得不向主人们告辞了。
    圣地亚哥的艺术生活
    在圣地亚哥的美术馆，除了经常的陈列外，正在举行着另外两个展览会，一个是智利画家的展览，一个是北美版画展览。
    智利的老一代的画家有着很好的成就，波尔玛（1855—1908）的“苏醒”，戏剧性地表现了人物的性格。利拉（1845—1912）的“在柱廊上”，写出了青年妇女的充满活力的色彩和灿烂的阳光。
    在智利第二届画展中，我们高兴地看到中国文化艺术界的老朋友——万徒勒里的几幅出品。其中一幅是“中国女童像”，另一幅叫“中国风景”。人们很惊奇于画家最近时期的画风的某些改变，在三、五年前的作品里，色彩比较阴暗，形象也比较悲壮。但最近的作品中，人们在画家的笔下看了明亮的色彩和愉快的情趣。许多智利朋友们说：看来，画家在中国的旅行，不仅使他在笔法和线条上受到了中国传统绘画的影响，而且，新中国的生活也使画家得到了难忘的感染。“中国女童像”这幅画中，充满着无限的爱情和信心，从这孩子的俏皮的辫子和智慧的眼神上，人们看到了力量和希望。
    在北美版画展览会上，我们看到迥然不同的两种画派的鲜明的对照：一种是坚定的现实主义作风，而另一种是畸形的现代主义。前者大多是风景和生活的描绘，后者则大多是抽象的主题，其中有许多或者不能引起人们的审美兴趣，或者则根本不能使人理解。我们很惊讶地看到即使在北美，现实主义的传统也仍为人们坚持和喜爱。但另一方面，也有一部分人，看来是太醉心于新的表现形式和独创的风格的追求了。但如果是确有工力的艺术家，有时对新的表现方法的追求，也确能创造出另有一番情趣的技法。而对于有些专为追求、创造新奇为能事的人，这只能说是一种躲避艰辛劳动的偷巧。
    从美术馆出来，智利朋友们要带我们去听一听智利音乐协会交响乐队的演奏会。入座时已经迟到了，只听了最后一个节目：维瓦尔第的G小调提琴协奏曲。这是专为普及音乐欣赏的星期音乐会，每张入座券只收五个比索（这只是象征性的收费，因为，一张中国艺术团的入座券定价达七百比索呢）。乐队指挥是德国客籍艺术家雷莫乃德。乐队并不因为是普及音乐会而有丝毫松懈，德国式的严谨和拉丁式的豪放结合在一起，演奏得有声有色。听众大多是学生、青年以至儿童。我们觉得，这种普及音乐会的做法很值得我们学习。因为，同行的智利朋友告诉我，许多青年就是这样学会了欣赏音乐，提高了审美趣味的。因为，他自己的孩子们的经历便是最使人信服的例子。（未完）（附图片）
