    Wuhan Auto Parts Factory Recycles Metal Scrap Worth Nearly 500,000 Yuan in One Year

    (Our report) Last year, the Wuhan Auto Parts Factory melted various metal scraps into ingots worth 689,000 yuan, and ingots worth 499,000 yuan have already been used in production. Last year, they used only more than 27,000 kilograms of new materials to manufacture tin-based alloy bearings, and the remaining more than 37,000 kilograms were ingots made from recycled scraps. The amount of scrap recycled was 36.9% more than the new materials; the amount of recycled scrap materials used to manufacture copper-lead alloy bearings was also 36.6% more than the new materials.

    They only started paying attention to waste metal recycling in June 1955. Before that, although they collected metal scraps, they were not well-maintained, and some were oxidized and deteriorated after long-term exposure to the sun and rain. At the same time, various metal scraps were not strictly separated during collection, and some, even if melted into ingots, could not be reused in production due to unqualified composition. Later, the factory repeatedly conveyed instructions on strengthening waste metal recycling, and helped employees establish the idea of ​​recycling waste metal through physical objects, picture exhibitions, and other education. At the same time, a Waste Metal Recycling and Utilization Working Committee was established, and a responsibility system and operating procedures for recycling and utilizing waste metal were gradually established, making this work more and more normalized.

    The biggest feature of their work is that they closely grasped three links, focusing on ensuring that waste metal must be recycled into production without affecting product quality.

    First, classify, sort and recycle and store according to the metal composition and the cleanliness of the scraps, so that the recycled scraps are not mixed with different types of metal scraps as much as possible. The scrap storage areas in the factory's machining workshops are separated by concrete slabs, and each compartment has a sign. The workshop porters store various scraps according to the sign numbers, and then the supply section workers drag them back to the warehouse for classification and storage, with wooden boards underneath to prevent the scraps from getting wet in rainy days. Second, strengthen the technical work of scrap melting, establish melting operating procedures, and strictly implement the system of testing each furnace, so that the quality of the recycled ingots fully meets the production requirements. Third, through repeated experiments, specifically determine the ratio of the amount of waste metal recycled to the amount of new material used, so as to balance the amount of recycling and the amount of scrap as much as possible.

    At present, the factory's steel scrap recycling is not good enough, and iron scrap cannot be fully recycled this year because it does not produce cylinder liners. They plan to use an electric furnace to re-refine steel scrap into low-carbon steel to make steel shells for bearings, and prepare to make white cast iron from iron scrap to cast miscellaneous items.

    武汉汽车配件厂在一年当中
    回用金属切屑价值近五十万元
    本报讯　武汉汽车配件厂去年一年将各种金属切屑熔成了价值六十八万九千多元的锭块，并且已有四十九万九千多元的锭块用到生产中去。去年，他们制造锡基合金轴承只用了二万七千多公斤新料，其余三万七千多公斤都是回用的这种切屑熔成的锭块，切屑的回用量比新料还多36.9％；制造铜铅合金轴承所回用的切屑材料也比新料多出36.6％。
    他们对废金属回收工作是从1955年6月才开始注意的。在这以前，他们虽然把金属切屑收集起来，但由于保管的不好，有的经过长期日晒雨淋氧化变质了。同时，收集时没有将各种金属切屑严格分开，有的即或熔成了锭块，因为成分不合格，不能回用于生产。后来，该厂一再传达了关于加强废金属回收工作的指示，并通过实物、图片展览等教育，帮助职工们树立了回用废金属的思想。同时，又成立了废金属回收利用工作委员会，逐步建立了回收和利用废金属的责任制度和操作规程，使这个工作一天天正常化。
    围绕废金属必须回用到生产中去而又不影响产品质量，紧紧抓住了三个环节，是他们工作中最大的特点。
    首先，按各种金属成分和切屑的清洁程度分类、分质回收和保管，使回收的切屑尽可能地不混有不同种类的金属切屑。这个厂机械加工车间的切屑堆放处都用混凝土板隔开了，每格挂有牌子，车间搬运工就按照牌号堆存各种切屑，然后由供应科工人拖回仓库分类存放，并在下面垫着木板，防止切屑在雨天受潮。第二、加强切屑熔化的技术工作，建立熔化的操作规程，并严格实行每炉化验的制度，使回收的锭块的质量完全合乎生产要求。第三、通过反复试验，具体确定废金属回用量同新料用量的比例，尽可能地使回用量与切屑量平衡。
    目前，这个厂的钢屑回用的还不够好，铁屑也因为今年不生产汽缸套而不能全部回用，他们准备用电炉将钢屑回炼成低炭钢做轴承的钢壳，准备将铁屑作成白口铁浇铸杂活。
