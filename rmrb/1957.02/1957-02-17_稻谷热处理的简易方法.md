Editor's Note: In recent years, newspapers and periodicals have advocated eating steamed rice, and people and agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places have asked the Ministry of Food for methods of heat-treating rice. Comrade Lu Shiyi of the Ministry of Food has written this article based on his observations during previous on-site inspections for everyone's reference.

The methods of heat-treating rice vary greatly from province to province. The methods used in the counties around Taihu Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are relatively practical, simple, and easy to implement.

The method in this area is to build an ordinary brick stove in a rectangular shape. The stove is divided into two types: forced draft and induced draft (also known as 'lifting draft'). The induced draft type utilizes the natural draft effect of a tall chimney for combustion and does not require manual operation of a bellows like the forced draft type. Place iron pots of varying sizes, 25 inches or more in diameter, on top of the stove, with three or four pots arranged in a row, each pot about a foot apart. Except for the smaller pot near the chimney, which is used exclusively for boiling water, all other pots are covered with wooden buckets, 25 inches high, with the bucket diameter matching the pot diameter. To prevent air leakage and friction between the bucket bottom and the pot edge, place a pot ring (made of woven rice straw) between the pot edge and the wooden bucket. The buckets generally hold 280 to 300 catties of rice, and the bucket bottom is fitted with a bamboo-woven ring to allow air to pass through. Coal or miscellaneous firewood can be used as fuel; in the Taihu area, rice husks are generally used, with about seven or eight to ten catties of rice husks needed to steam 100 catties of rice. There are three steaming methods:

(1) Water-Bath Steaming: Before steaming the rice, first wash it with clean water, either in a water tank or with rice baskets. After washing, place the rice in bamboo storage bins in batches and store it overnight (at least for two hours or more) to allow the rice bran to absorb some moisture. The storage time should be adjusted according to the weather. Then, pour the washed rice into the wooden bucket on top of the pot for steaming. During steaming, the wooden bucket is usually not covered, but some people use a bamboo hat-like cover. When the hot air rises from the pot, passes through the rice in the bucket, and wets the top layer of the rice, remove the bucket from the pot, and then either cover the bucket for ten minutes or immediately pour the rice into a storage circle and cover it with straw mats for one or two days to even out the heat. The steaming time is about twenty minutes, until steam is seen coming out of the top of the bucket.

(2) Watering Steaming: Also known as splash-water steaming. The rice is not washed but is poured directly into the wooden bucket. When the steam rises to the surface of the rice, pour warm water onto the surface of the rice to slightly reduce the steam. When the steam rises to the top of the rice again, the process is considered successful. Alternatively, clean water can be sprinkled on the top of the rice in the bucket before steaming or after placing it on the pot. Although the timing of watering varies, it is essential to ensure that the rice grains are evenly moistened; otherwise, the rice will not be uniformly cooked.

(3) Dry-Grain Steaming: This method involves neither washing nor watering the rice, but simply steaming the original rice until it is moistened. This method is suitable for rural areas because newly harvested rice can be steamed directly without first being dried. Damp rice can also be steamed using this method.

After steaming the rice using any of the above methods, allow it to sit for a sufficient amount of time, and then take it out to dry. Generally, the rice is dried in the sun, but some people also stir-fry it in a pot to dry it. Drying the rice is more difficult to control than steaming it because the water content of the rice increases after steaming, and the grains expand. Once exposed to sunlight, the moisture evaporates, and the grains shrink. Therefore, it is necessary to control the temperature to determine the thickness of the rice layer and the length of drying time. Generally, in winter, the rice layer should be only one to one and a half inches thick, in autumn one and a half to two inches, and in summer two to three inches or more. In summer, it takes one or half a day to dry the rice, while in winter it takes two days. The drying ground should preferably be brick or stone paved. The dried rice is not very firm and should be stored for at least three to five days before processing; it is even better to store it for a longer period.

A complete set of steaming equipment like this, including the building and drying ground, costs only two or three thousand yuan, and a stove costs about three to five hundred yuan. The equipment and premises can mostly be utilized from existing farmhouses, without the need for new construction. A single stove can steam nearly 100,000 catties of rice if operated day and night.

    稻谷热处理的简易方法
    陆士一
    编者按　近年，报刊提倡食用蒸谷米后，各地群众和农业生产合作社纷纷向粮食部询问稻谷的热处理方法。粮食部陆士一同志根据历次实地考查所见，写出这篇文章，供大家参考。
    热处理稻谷的法子，各省很不一致。江苏和浙江两省环太湖各县的方法，是比较合用而简单易行的。
    这一带的方法是：用普通的砖，砌一个长方形的灶；灶分拉风和吊风（亦称提风）两式，吊风式系利用高烟囱自然的起助燃作用，无须像拉风式的要用人力拉动风箱。灶的上面放置直径二十五英寸以上的不等大小的铁锅，每三、四只列成一行，每只之间，距离尺许；除了靠近烟囱的较小的锅子专作煮开水之用外，其他锅子之上，都复以木桶，桶高二十五英寸，桶径与锅径要恰相配合。为要避免透气和桶底与锅边的摩擦，在锅边与木桶之下，放一个锅圈（用稻草编制）。桶一般能装谷二百八十斤到三百市斤，桶底装有竹丝制成的圈，可以透气。燃料用煤或杂柴都可以；太湖地区一般利用砻糠，每蒸谷百斤，约需砻糠七、八斤到十斤。蒸法分为三种：
    （一）浴谷蒸　把稻谷在上蒸之前，先用清水淘洗，用水缸或稻箩等器淘洗淋浇都可以。洗过的谷，分批放进竹囤，存放一夜（至少也要两小时以上），使谷皮的部分水分吸入米粒。囤谷时间要视气候的冷热有所伸缩。然后把洗过的谷倒入锅上的木桶中蒸。蒸的时候，木桶上多不加盖，但也有加一竹笠式的盖的。等到锅中热气上升，透过桶中稻谷，直到谷的上层潮湿，把桶从锅上扛下，连桶闷十几分钟或马上倒入囤圈，再加上草垫闷一、二天，使谷的热度均匀。蒸的时间大约在二十分钟左右，看见桶顶冒气就可以了。
    （二）浇水蒸　亦称泼水蒸。稻谷不用水洗，就倒入木桶中，等汽水上升到谷的表面时，以温水浇于谷面，使水汽稍退，等气再冒到谷的上面，就算成功。也可在上蒸以前，先用清水向桶顶谷面泼下，或放在锅上后再浇。浇水的先后虽不同，必须使谷粒受湿均匀，否则谷的生熟不能一致。
    （三）干谷蒸　这种方法既不洗谷，也不浇水，纯以原来的谷直接蒸湿为止。此法宜于农村采用，因为新收的谷，不用经过先晒干，就可以直接蒸；受潮的谷子，也可用此法来蒸。
    用各种方法蒸了以后的稻谷，经过充分时间的闷，然后再取出来晒。一般都是利用阳光晒干，也有放在锅子里炒干的。晒谷比蒸谷更难掌握一些，因为谷经蒸过后，含水量增加，粒子涨大，一经日光，水分蒸发，谷粒收缩，所以要掌握温度的高低，来定摊谷的厚薄和晒的时间的长短。一般冬季只摊一寸到寸半厚，秋季寸半到二寸，夏则二寸到三寸多；夏季晒一天或半天，冬季却要晒二天。晒场最好是砖砌或石铺的。晒后的谷，还不大坚韧，至少要储存三、五天，方可加工，能多放些时更好。
    像这样的全套蒸谷设备，连房屋、晒场，不过二、三千元，灶一只约三、五百元。器材和屋场，大都可以利用农家原有的，无需另制。一灶蒸谷，倘日夜不息，可蒸谷近十万斤。
