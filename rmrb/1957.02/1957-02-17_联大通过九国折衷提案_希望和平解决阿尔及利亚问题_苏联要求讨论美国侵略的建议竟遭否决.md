Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the 16th to discuss the Algerian issue.

Before the meeting, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand on one side, and Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Italy, and Peru on the other, held talks with the participation of some other countries to compromise on the two different proposals they had respectively submitted and which had been adopted by the Political Committee. After the talks, they submitted a nine-nation compromise proposal to the General Assembly, stating: "The United Nations General Assembly has heard the statements of the various delegations and discussed the Algerian issue; noting the situation in Algeria that is causing great human suffering and loss of life; expresses the hope that, in a spirit of cooperation, through appropriate means, and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, a peaceful, democratic, and just solution will be sought."

At the beginning of the assembly, the President of the General Assembly, the Thai representative Mr. Naradhip, immediately suggested that the assembly proceed to a vote so that the representatives would have time to explain their voting attitudes. The assembly then adopted this compromise proposal by a vote of seventy-seven to zero. France did not vote, and Hungary and South Africa were absent.

Ceylonese representative Mr. Gunawardene said that the compromise proposal was put forward in a spirit of understanding and a sincere wish, which was "a willingness to see the Algerian people gain freedom, while helping France maintain those traditions it has represented for many centuries. We hope that no more repressive action will be taken. The conditions for negotiations are now present."

Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: New York dispatch: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 14th to discuss the Soviet delegation's proposal to include the issue of "Aggressive Actions by the United States Threatening Peace and Security" on the agenda of the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Due to the opposition of some representatives, the committee rejected the proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: New York dispatch: At the plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the 15th, the head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, once again requested the plenary meeting to discuss the United States' aggressive actions threatening peace and security.

Kuznetsov said that the United States' current activities in international affairs are reverting to a Cold War policy, thus exacerbating relations with other countries. Kuznetsov also said that the Eisenhower Plan proves that the United States hopes to implement a broad economic expansion and direct military aggression policy in the Middle East. This plan shows the United States' attempt to suppress national liberation movements and replace British and French influence in the Middle East.

The General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal by a vote of fifty-three to thirteen. Countries supporting the Soviet proposal included Eastern European People's Democratic countries, Yugoslavia, Egypt, India, Jordan, and Syria.

The plenary meeting adopted a U.S. proposal recommending that the closing date of this session be set for February 23rd, and also stipulated that before the 23rd, the General Committee of the UN General Assembly should meet to decide whether it is necessary to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the Middle East issue and the so-called "Hungarian issue." The Soviet delegation moved to delete the so-called "Hungarian issue," which is currently on the agenda of the General Assembly, but the motion was not adopted.

    联大通过九国折衷提案
    希望和平解决阿尔及利亚问题
    苏联要求讨论美国侵略的建议竟遭否决
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会16日举行全体会议，讨论阿尔及利亚问题。
    在会议举行前，日本、菲律宾和泰国一方和阿根廷、巴西、古巴、多米尼加共和国、意大利和秘鲁另一方在其他一些国家的参加下举行了会谈，就它们分别提出的并且得到政治委员会通过的两项内容不同的提案进行折衷。会谈后，它们向大会提出了一个九国折衷提案，这个提案说：“联合国大会听取了各个代表团的发言并且讨论了阿尔及利亚问题；注意到了正在造成人类生命的巨大痛苦和损失的阿尔及利亚的局势；表示希望，根据合作的精神，通过适当的手段，并且按照联合国宪章的原则，将会求得一个和平、民主和公正的解决办法。”
    在大会开始时，大会主席、泰国代表那拉底立即建议大会进行表决，以便使代表们有时间解释投票态度。大会接着以七十七票对零票通过了这项折衷提案。法国没有投票，匈牙利和南非缺席。
    锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼说，折衷提案是以谅解的精神和真诚的愿望提出的，这个愿望就是“愿意看到阿尔及利亚人民获得自由，同时帮助法国获得它许多世纪以来所代表的那些传统。我们希望不再采取镇压行动。进行谈判的条件已经具备了。”
    据新华社15日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会总务委员会14日举行会议，讨论苏联代表团提出的把“关于美国威胁和平与安全的侵略行动”问题列入联合国大会第十一届会议议程的建议。由于一些代表的反对，委员会否决了这个建议。
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：在15日的联合国大会全体会议上，苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫再次要求全体会议讨论美国威胁和平与安全的侵略行动。
    库兹涅佐夫说，美国目前在国际事务中的活动正在回到冷战政策上去，因此加剧了和其他国家的关系。库兹涅佐夫还说，艾森豪威尔计划证明美国希望在中东实行一个广泛的经济扩张和直接的军事侵略政策，这个计划表明美国企图镇压民族解放运动和取代英法在中东的势力。
    大会以五十三票对十三票否决了苏联的提案，支持苏联提案的有东欧人民民主国家、南斯拉夫、埃及、印度、约旦和叙利亚。
    全体会议通过了美国的一项提案，这项提案建议把本届会议的闭幕日期定为2月23日，并且还规定在23日以前由联大总务委员会开会决定是否需要举行紧急会议来讨论中东问题和所谓“匈牙利问题”。苏联代表团动议删去目前列在联大议程上的所谓“匈牙利问题”，这个动议没有得到通过。
