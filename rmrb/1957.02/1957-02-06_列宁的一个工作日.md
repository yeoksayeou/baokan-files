    “A Day in the Life of Lenin”	Gancao
    The People’s Daily published a short news item on January 24: "A Day in the Life of Lenin."
    I don’t know about others, but after reading it, I felt very ashamed: we are doing too little work in a day.
    Lenin was probably one of the busiest revolutionary workers. On this very ordinary day—February 2, 1921—he personally drafted several important documents, presided over and attended three meetings, and signed dozens of resolutions. Lenin did not just sign the documents without looking at them like some bureaucrats, but "carefully revised the original manuscripts of various documents."
    Here, of course, many comrades also have heavy workloads, but there are also some workers who are not very busy but shout "busy" all day long. What do you think after looking at Lenin's work?
    The heads of some units are said to be so busy that they don't even have the opportunity to approach lower-level cadres, so that some out-of-town cadres who come to report on their work have to send telegrams from hotels to discuss their work. But what about Lenin? "I hope to be free between 9 and 10 o'clock tonight and let Vladimirsky give me a call." Lenin was busy all day, and he "hoped" that his secretary would leave him an hour free in the evening, without arranging other schedules, so that he could talk to a comrade.
    Lenin was so busy from morning to night, and he still wrote dozens of volumes of the "Complete Works of Lenin." Lenin was not only good at arranging work, but also good at "squeezing" time, reading tens of thousands of books, and writing so many great works. This is something we should learn from.
    An exhibition like "A Day in the Life of Lenin" is a very vivid form of propaganda and mobilization. It uses the method of typical demonstration, using the work example of a historical giant to inspire people and spur them on.

    “列宁的一个工作日”	甘草
    1月24日人民日报发表了一篇短讯：“列宁的一个工作日”。
    不知道别人怎么样，我看了之后感觉十分惭愧：我们一天的工作是做得太少了。
    列宁大概要算是一个最忙碌的革命工作者。就在这个最普通的日子里——1921年2月2日，他亲手起草了好几个重要文件，主持和出席了三次会议，签署了几十个决议。在这些决议上，列宁不是像某些官僚主义者那样看也不看就在文件上签个字了事，而是“经过他仔细修改过的各种文件的原稿”。
    在我们这里，当然有不少同志的工作也很繁重，但也有一些并不很忙却整天大喊“忙”的工作者。看看列宁的工作，作何感想？
    有些单位的负责人据说是忙得连接近下级干部的机会都没有了，以至有些前来汇报工作的外地干部不得不在旅馆里打电报谈工作。可是列宁怎么样？“我希望今天晚上九—十点钟的时候有空，让弗拉吉米尔斯基给我打个电话来”。列宁忙了一整天，他“希望”秘书同志给他在晚上留下一点钟的空子，不要安排其他的日程，以便他和一个同志谈谈。
    列宁从早到晚这样忙，还写出了几十卷“列宁全集”。列宁不仅善于安排工作，而且善于“榨取”时间，读破万卷书，写出那么多伟大的著作来。这是多么值得我们学习呀。
    像“列宁的一个工作日”这样的展览会，是非常生动的宣传鼓动形式。它以典型示范的方法，用一个历史巨人的工作范例来鼓舞人们，鞭策人们。
