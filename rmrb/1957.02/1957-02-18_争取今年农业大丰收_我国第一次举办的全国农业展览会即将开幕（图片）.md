Strive for a Bumper Harvest This Year
China's First National Agricultural Exhibition Is About to Open

The National Agricultural Exhibition, jointly organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Central Meteorological Bureau, and the Ministry of Aquatic Products, is about to open the day after tomorrow.

This exhibition is located in the Soviet Exhibition Hall in the capital and is divided into eleven pavilions: the Comprehensive Pavilion, the Crop Pavilion I and II, the Increased Production Measures Pavilion, the Animal Husbandry Pavilion, the State-owned Farm Pavilion, the Tropical Crop Pavilion, the Forestry Pavilion, the Water Conservancy Pavilion, the Meteorology Pavilion, and the Aquatic Products Pavilion.

The exhibition introduces the great achievements and experiences China has made in agricultural socialist transformation and in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, water conservancy, and meteorology in recent years. The exhibition of these achievements and the introduction of these experiences at this exhibition will greatly encourage and promote farmers across the country to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

In Crop Pavilion I, abundant products such as rice, millet, wheat, corn, and oil crops are displayed. At the same time, many high-yield and large-area high-yield experiences are introduced.

This is one of the charts exhibited in Crop Pavilion I. It tells people that the rice planted by the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, yielded 380 jin per mu in 1950, and the yield per mu increased to 826 jin in 1956.

Cotton is one of the important industrial raw materials. The total national output increased from 8,888,800 dan in 1949 to about 30,500,000 dan in 1959. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu increased from 21 jin to 35 jin. In 1956, the yield of ginned cotton per mu exceeded 50 jin on 17 million mu of cotton fields across the country, of which 3 million mu reached 100 jin.

Edible oil is a necessity of people's daily life and also a raw material for industrial production. These are specimens of oil materials such as peanuts, soybeans, rapeseed, and sesame.

In the center of the Water Conservancy Pavilion, China's self-made water conservancy survey instruments are displayed. The quality of this instrument has reached the international level.

In the Tropical Crop Pavilion, crops such as rubber, sisal, coffee, and coconut, as well as their finished products, are displayed. The commentator is practicing explaining the growth process of sisal and its use value.

If China's timber production in 1950 is taken as 100, then it has increased to 336.1 in 1956. This display stand shows finished products made from wood.

Crop Pavilion II also exhibits many valuable Chinese medicinal materials. These are musk from Tibet and ginseng from Jilin.

These are excellent breeds of livestock and poultry.

The agricultural machinery section of the Increased Production Measures Pavilion exhibits various farm implements, from the oldest to the newest. The farm implements and charts exhibited in this section tell people that in order to increase production, it is necessary to promote various new-style farm implements according to the different natural conditions of each region.

Since liberation, China has expanded many meteorological observatories and stations, and strengthened weather forecasting, which has played a certain role in ensuring increased agricultural production. This is a model of meteorological equipment exhibited in the Meteorology Pavilion.

The exhibition also displays agricultural machinery from fraternal countries supporting China.

    争取今年农业大丰收
    我国第一次举办的全国农业展览会即将开幕
    由农业部会同农垦部、林业部、水利部、中央气象局、水产部共同举办的全国农业展览会，后天就要开幕了。
    这个展览会设在首都苏联展览馆内，共分十一个馆，即：综合馆，农作物第一、第二馆，增产措施馆，畜牧馆，国营农场馆，热带作物馆，林业馆，水利馆，气象馆和水产馆。
    展览会介绍了我国几年来农业社会主义改造和农、林、渔、牧、水利、气象等方面所取得的巨大成就及其经验。在这个展览会上，这些成就的展出和经验的介绍，将会大大鼓励和推动全国农民争取今年农业的大丰收。

    在农作物第一馆里，陈列了丰产的稻子、谷子、麦子、玉米和油料作物等产品，同时，介绍了许多高额的和大面积的丰产经验。
    这是在农作物第一馆展出的图表之一。它告诉人们，辽宁省营口县前进农业生产合作社种的水稻，1950年亩产三百八十斤，1956年的亩产量增加到八百二十六斤。
    棉花是重要的工业原料之一。全国总产量由1949年的八百八十八万八千担增加到1959年的三千零五十万担左右。皮棉的亩产量平均由二十一斤增加到三十五斤。1956年，全国有一千七百万亩棉田亩产量皮棉超过五十斤，其中有三百万亩达到一百斤。
    食油是人民日常生活的必需品，也是工业生产的原料之一。这是花生、大豆、油菜籽、芝麻等油料的标本。
    在水利馆的中央，陈列着我国自制的水利勘测仪器。这种仪器的质量已经达到国际水平。
    在热带作物馆里，陈列着橡胶、剑麻、咖啡和椰子等作物及其制成品。解说员正在练习讲解剑麻的生长过程和它的使用价值。
    我国的木材生产量，如以1950年作一百，则1956年已增加到三百三十六点一。这个展览台上展出的是用木材加工制出的成品。
    在农作物第二馆里还展出了许多我国出产的贵重药材。这是西藏的麝香和吉林的人参。
    这是优良的牲畜和家禽品种。
    在增产措施馆的农业机械部分展出了各种农具，这里有最老式的，也有最新式的。这一部分展出的农具和图表，告诉人们，为了要增产，就需要根据各地区不同的自然条件，推广各种不同的新式农具。
    自从解放以来，我国扩建了不少气象台和气象站，加强了天气预报工作，对保证农业增产起了一定的作用。这是气象馆里展出的气象设备的模型。
    在展览会里，也陈列了各兄弟国家支援我国的农业机器。
