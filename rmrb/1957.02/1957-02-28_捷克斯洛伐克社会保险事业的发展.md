The Development of Social Insurance in Czechoslovakia
Ye Erban, Director of the Czechoslovak National Social Security Bureau

It has been less than twelve years since Czechoslovakia was liberated from the Nazi German occupation, but this short period can be said to be an extremely important era in its history. The labor achievements and experiences gained by the Czechoslovak people during this period in the process of building socialism are not only of great significance to our people, but also very meaningful to the people of other countries that have embarked on the road of socialism. At the same time, these experiences and achievements are also instructive for the people of capitalist countries, especially for the people of Western European countries that used to have many common points with Czechoslovakia in terms of economy and society. Before the war, Czechoslovakia's industrial development was already among the most advanced in Europe, and our social conditions at that time were similar to those of Western European countries. But at the same time, Czechoslovakia's industry was often affected by the fluctuations of the capitalist world economy, and sometimes even suffered serious economic crises.

After liberation, Czechoslovakia began a new stage of development. From a historical point of view, this stage powerfully proves the brilliant achievements made by a country with originally highly developed economy in socialist construction.

Since its birth, our Communist Party has led the people in the struggle against exploitation and for social liberation, and it enjoys great prestige among the broad masses of working people. During the occupation, our Communist Party led the underground struggle against the Nazi bandits, in which it made great sacrifices for the freedom of the people. After liberation, the Party began to lead the National Front and the Czechoslovak people in the creative labor of building socialism.

From the very beginning, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the National Front government formulated a program for a new life for all working people. This new national program included the demands that various strata of working people had put forward long ago. Its main goals were: to eliminate unemployment and poverty; to guarantee employment for all workers and intellectuals; to guarantee peasants' access to land; to guarantee all working people the right to health care, rest and education, as well as the right to material security for citizens during prenatal and postnatal periods, old age, lack of support, and loss of working ability.

During the period from 1945 to 1948, the Party led the people in a fierce class struggle against all forces that maintained the old system. Thanks to the unity and high consciousness of the working class, and thanks to the strong revolutionary leadership, the democratic forces, with the working people as the mainstay, finally nationalized the basic means of production and implemented land reform. In the years when the working class struggled for economic and political rights and for alliance with the peasants, the most serious economic wounds and social consequences of the war and fascist occupation were overcome.

In the February events of 1948, the reactionary forces' attempt to restore their original class status was crushed without bloodshed, thanks to the solidarity of the working class and the support of the peasants and intellectuals for the working class. In the same year, industrial production exceeded pre-war levels for the first time, and major social achievements were made, the most important of which was the implementation of the Social Insurance Law. The implementation of this law greatly improved the security of employees when they temporarily lost their ability to work and when they received pensions. After the implementation of the Social Insurance Law, not only workers and staff, but also the welfare of farmers, trade workers and handicraftsmen was guaranteed. After 1948, Czechoslovakia's economy has been greatly developed. During the first Five-Year Plan from 1949 to 1953, Czechoslovakia's industrial production nearly doubled. The second Five-Year Plan, which started in 1956, stipulates that by 1960, Czechoslovakia's industrial production should be two and a half times more than the highest output during the capitalist period. At the same time, agricultural production, which has already exceeded the pre-war level, will be increased by another 30%.

In terms of output per capita, People's Democratic Czechoslovakia is catching up with the most developed industrial countries in Western Europe. Czechoslovakia not only surpasses Western European countries in terms of the growth rate of production, but also greatly surpasses those capitalist countries that were famous in Europe for their advanced social insurance laws before the war in terms of the growth of the welfare of the working people and social insurance.

After the war, prices in Czechoslovakia have been reduced six times, and working days have been shortened, while wages have been continuously increasing during this period. Now the actual wages of employees are 130% higher than before the war. The planned development of the national economy guarantees the right to work for every citizen. Among the more than 13 million people in the country, there are 4.5 million workers and staff, and the total number of employees has increased by a quarter compared with before the war. All employees are entitled to vacations ranging from two weeks to five weeks, during which they retain their original salaries. The material and cultural living conditions in the countryside have also been greatly improved.

At the end of 1956, a new Social Insurance Law for working people was promulgated, which is currently the law that reflects the highest degree of socio-economic progress in the world. Working women are entitled to 18 weeks (126 days) of maternity leave before and after childbirth and are entitled to a subsidy equivalent to 90% of their wages. Workers, staff, members of agricultural production cooperatives, pension recipients and their family members have the right to enjoy public medical care and sanatorium treatment, while in the past, only the wealthy class could enjoy sanatorium treatment. During illness, employees can receive temporary incapacity benefits from the first day of illness, which is usually equivalent to 90% of their wages. Employees are also entitled to receive childbirth subsidies and funeral subsidies. Workers, staff and pension recipients can receive family allowances to educate their children.

Workers, staff, members of agricultural production cooperatives, individual farmers, self-employed individuals and their family members are entitled to old-age pensions and disability pensions. According to the new social insurance law that came into effect at the beginning of this year, the pensions received by workers and staff have been greatly increased, and the conditions have been relaxed. Following the example of the Soviet Union's social insurance law, we also divide pensions into several types according to the nature and significance of the work. Miners and pilots who are 55 years old or older and have worked for more than 20 years are entitled to an old-age pension, which is equivalent to 60% to 90% of their average wage, and the specific amount depends on the length of service. Women who are 55 years old or older are also entitled to an old-age pension. Other employees who are 60 years old or older and have worked for more than 20 years are entitled to an old-age pension, which is equivalent to 50% to 85% of their average wage. Employees who have lost their ability to work for a long time can receive a disability pension, which is roughly equal to the old-age pension. Widows and orphans can receive a pension for the loss of their supporters. The conditions and amounts of material security enjoyed by members of agricultural cooperatives and other self-employed individuals are different from those of employees. In addition to the pensions allocated by the state to cooperative members, there is also a mutual aid fund for cooperative members, so the amount of pensions for members is also considerable.

At present, there are a total of 1.8 million people receiving pensions in Czechoslovakia, and last year a total of 7.5 billion crowns were spent on pensions. The national expenditure on health care, temporary incapacity benefits, prenatal and postnatal subsidies, and pensions accounts for almost one-fifth of the national budget. By 1960, social insurance costs will increase by 50%. According to statistics from the International Labor Organization, Czechoslovakia spends 900 crowns per person per year on social insurance, the Federal Republic of Germany spends 650 crowns, and the United Kingdom spends 600 crowns. In 1957, due to the implementation of the new social insurance law, the social insurance fee spent on each person will reach 1,200 crowns.

The great achievements of Czechoslovakia's social policy have greatly improved the people's living standards and reflect the strength of our socialist production. In 1960, Czechoslovakia's heavy industry production, calculated on a per capita basis, will reach the level of the current Federal Republic of Germany. In terms of the production of daily necessities, for example, the production level of our textile industry and leather shoe industry per capita has exceeded that of the United Kingdom. The achievements made in cultural and living facilities are the result of the unity of our people in socialist construction, the result of our peaceful foreign policy and the further consolidation of the socialist camp, and the result of our alliance with the Soviet Union and the common stance taken by all countries in the socialist camp against imperialist aggression.

So far, there is no second country like Czechoslovakia, a country with a high level of economic and cultural development, engaged in socialist construction. The greater our responsibility in the peaceful competition with Western countries, the more significant our contribution in the struggle for the socialist future of mankind. The people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia will prove with their own policies and labor that they clearly understand their own interests and historical mission.

Although Czechoslovakia is far away from China, the people of our two countries are close friends in the struggle and labor to achieve common goals. The birth and rapid development of People's China, the increase in its international prestige, its achievements in construction, and its contribution to revolutionary science all make the people of Czechoslovakia feel proud and encouraged, and provide them with a brave and wise example.

    捷克斯洛伐克社会保险事业的发展
    捷克斯洛伐克国家社会保险局局长　叶·艾尔班
    捷克斯洛伐克从纳粹德国占领下解放出来还不满十二年，但在它的历史上，这短短的时期却可以说是一个极为重要的时代。捷克斯洛伐克人民在这个期间在建设社会主义的过程中所取得的劳动成果和所获得的经验不仅对于我国人民具有重大意义，而且对于已经走上社会主义道路的其他各国人民也是很有意义的。同时，这些经验和成果，对于资本主义国家的人民来说也有教益，特别是对于那些过去在经济和社会方面同捷克斯洛伐克有着许多共同点的西欧国家的人民来说更是如此。战前，捷克斯洛伐克工业的发展程度就已经位于欧洲的前列了，而我国的社会状况当时也和西欧各国相类似。但与此同时，捷克斯洛伐克的工业也经常受到资本主义世界经济的波动的影响，有时甚至受到经济危机的严重灾害。
    解放以后，捷克斯洛伐克开始了一个新的发展阶段。从历史观点看来，这个阶段有力地证明了一个原来经济高度发展的国家在社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就。
    由于我国共产党从它诞生的时候起就领导人民进行反对剥削争取社会解放的斗争，它在广大劳动群众中享有巨大的威信。在被占领期间，我们共产党领导了反纳粹匪帮的地下斗争，在这个斗争中它为人民的自由做出了重大牺牲。解放以后，党又开始领导民族阵线和捷克斯洛伐克人民进行建设社会主义的创造性劳动。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和民族阵线政府，从一开始就为全体劳动人民拟订了新生活的纲领。这个新的全国性纲领包括劳动人民各个阶层很久以前所提出的要求。它的主要目标是：消灭失业和贫困；保障全体工人和知识分子的劳动就业；保障农民取得土地；保障全体劳动人民有保健、休息和受教育的权利，以及公民在产前产后、年老、无人供养和丧失劳动能力时获得物质保障的权利。
    在1945到1948年这个时期内，党领导人民同一切维护旧制度的势力进行了剧烈的阶级斗争。由于工人阶级的团结和高度觉悟，由于坚强的革命领导，以劳动人民为主的民主力量终于把基本生产资料收归国有，并实行了土地改革。在工人阶级为争取经济和政治权利以及争取同农民结成联盟而进行斗争的几年过程中，克服了战争和法西斯占领的最严重的经济创伤和社会后果。
    在1948年的二月事件中，由于工人阶级的团结一致和农民与知识分子对工人阶级的支持，反动势力想恢复原有阶级地位的企图未经流血而被粉碎了。同年，工业生产第一次超过了战前水平，并且取得了重大的社会成就，其中最主要的是实行了社会保险法。这项法律的实施大大改善了职工在暂时失去工作能力时和在领取抚恤金时所得到的保障。社会保险法实行以后，不但工人和职员，而且农民、贸易工作者和手工业者的福利也得到了保障。1948年以后，捷克斯洛伐克的经济得到了巨大的发展。在1949到1953年的第一个五年计划期间，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产增加了近一倍。从1956年开始的第二个五年计划规定，到1960年，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产要比资本主义时期的最高产量多两倍半。同时，已经超过了战前水平的农业生产量也将再提高30％。
    在按人口平均的产量方面，人民民主捷克斯洛伐克正在赶上西欧工业最发达的国家。捷克斯洛伐克不但在生产的增长速度方面超过西欧国家，而且在劳动人民的福利增长和社会保险方面，也大大地超过了那些战前在欧洲曾以先进的社会保险法而著名的资本主义国家。
    战后，捷克斯洛伐克的物价已降低了六次，劳动日也缩短了，而在此期间工资却一直在不断地提高着。现在职工的实际工资已比战前高130％。由于有计划地发展国民经济，保证了每一个公民的劳动权。在全国一千三百多万人口中，有工人和职员四百五十万人，职工总数比战前增加了四分之一。全体职工都享有休假两个星期到五个星期的权利，休假期间保留原薪。乡村的物质和文化生活条件也得到了很大的改善。
    在1956年年底，颁布了新的劳动人民社会保险法，这是目前世界上反映社会经济进步程度最高的法律。劳动妇女在产前产后享有休假十八个星期（一百二十六天）的权利，并有权领取相当于工资90％的补助金。工人、职员、农业生产合作社社员、领抚恤金者及其家庭成员有享受公费医疗的权利，也有享受疗养院治疗的权利，而在从前，只有富有阶层才能享受疗养院治疗。患病期间，职工从患病的第一天起即可领取临时丧失劳动能力的补助金，这种补助金通常相当于工资的90％。职工还有权领取生育子女补助金和安葬补助金。工人、职员和领抚恤金者可以领取用来教育子女的家庭补助费。
    工人、职员、农业生产合作社社员、个体农民、从事独立劳动的人以及他们的家庭成员都有享受年老抚恤和残废抚恤的权利。根据本年年初开始实行的新的社会保险法，工人和职员领取的抚恤金大大增加了，条件也放宽了。我们仿效苏联的社会保险法，根据工作性质和意义的不同也把抚恤金分成若干种类。年满五十五岁的矿工和飞行员，其工龄在二十年以上者有权领取年老抚恤金，抚恤金的数额相当于平均工资的60％到90％，其具体数额根据工龄长短而定。年满五十五岁的妇女也有权领取年老抚恤金。年满六十岁的其他职工，工龄在二十年以上者有权领取年老抚恤金，抚恤金数额相当于平均工资的50％到85％。长期丧失劳动能力的职工可以领取残废抚恤金，残废抚恤金的数额大致和年老抚恤金相等。寡妇和孤儿可以领取丧失供养人的抚恤金。农业合作社社员以及其他从事独立劳动的人享受物质保障的条件和数额同职工有所不同。除国家拨出的合作社社员的抚恤金以外，还有合作社社员的互助基金，因此社员的抚恤金数额也是很可观的。
    现在捷克斯洛伐克领抚恤金的人一共有一百八十万人，去年共支出抚恤金七十五亿克郎。国家支出的卫生保健费、临时丧失劳动能力补助金、产前产后补助金和抚恤金几乎占国家预算的五分之一。到1960年社会保险费用还要增加50％。根据国际劳动组织的统计，捷克斯洛伐克每年用在每一个人身上的社会保险费用是九百克郎，德意志联邦共和国是六百五十克郎，英国是六百克郎。1957年由于实行了新的社会保险法，用在每一个人身上的社会保险费将达到一千二百克郎。
    捷克斯洛伐克的社会政策所取得的巨大成绩大大提高了人民的生活水平，并反映了我们的社会主义生产的力量。1960年，捷克斯洛伐克的重工业生产，按人口平均计算将达到现在德意志联邦共和国的水平。在日用品生产方面，例如我国的纺织工业和皮鞋工业按人口计算的生产水平已超过英国。在文化和生活设施方面取得的成绩是我国人民在社会主义建设中团结一致的结果，是我国和平的对外政策和社会主义阵营进一步巩固的结果，是我国同苏联缔结同盟、和反对帝国主义侵略的整个社会主义阵营各国采取共同立场的结果。
    到现在为止，像捷克斯洛伐克这样一个经济文化原先就已高度发展的国家在从事社会主义建设的，还没有第二个。在和西方国家的和平竞赛中我们的责任愈大，在争取人类的社会主义前途的斗争中我们的贡献也就愈显著。捷克斯洛伐克各族人民将用自己的政策和劳动证明，他们是清楚地理解自己的利益和历史使命的。
    尽管捷克斯洛伐克同中国的距离很远，但在为达到共同目的而进行的斗争和劳动中，我们两国人民是亲密的好朋友。人民中国的诞生和迅速发展、它的国际威望的提高、建设中的成就以及对革命科学的贡献，这一切都使捷克斯洛伐克人民感到骄傲和鼓舞，并为他们作出了勇敢和智慧的榜样。　（本报特约稿　仲瑞译）
