Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Today, the famous mechanician Qian Xuesen spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters about his thoughts on attending the ongoing National Mechanics Academic Conference.

Qian Xuesen said: "Judging from the papers presented at the six group sessions of this conference—Structural Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, Elastic Mechanics, Plastic Mechanics, General Mechanics, and Automatic Control—almost every group has several papers that have reached international level. This means that in various fields of mechanics in our country, there are already some very mature researchers. Other papers are the result of the efforts of the new forces in China's mechanics field. The fact that these young people's papers can be reported at the mechanics academic conference shows that the new forces are growing very rapidly." He said, "Of course, we cannot demand too much from their papers."

Qian Xuesen continued, "From this academic conference, we can see that we have begun to pay attention to filling some important gaps in mechanics as a discipline. At the same time, it also reflects the uneven development of various departments of mechanics in China. Some departments are developing faster, while some important departments are relatively weak. For example, judging from the papers at this conference, there are the most papers on elastic mechanics, far fewer on plastic mechanics, and the number of papers on fluid mechanics falls in between. But everyone believes that fluid mechanics and elastic mechanics should have the same number of papers, and the work of plastic mechanics should also be more substantial than it is now. Of course, in the future, we must achieve a corresponding balance between branches according to the importance of each branch." Qian Xuesen said, "In general, the conference reflects that the experimental work of mechanics is much weaker than theoretical research. This is because mechanics research has only been vigorously developed after liberation, especially in recent years, and experimental equipment requires long-term efforts to establish."

Qian Xuesen said, "Mechanics is a multifaceted science that requires a close integration of theory and practice. Mechanics workers must not only master theory, experiment, and calculation methods, but also understand engineering technology. That is to say, mechanics workers are required to have a broad scope, be familiar with the problems occurring in actual industrial sectors, and know how to refine them into research objects. This is the most fundamental and most important ability of mechanics workers, but it is also what most young mechanics workers in our country currently lack." Qian Xuesen believes that to achieve this, mechanics workers in universities, the Academy of Sciences, and industrial sectors must be closely integrated. In this way, the mechanics research cause will develop rapidly.

When talking about the future development direction of mechanics research in our country, Qian Xuesen said: "The direction of mechanics research in all countries is determined by the development needs of the national economy and national defense construction. Therefore, as mechanics researchers in a developing country that is catching up with the world level, we must also pay attention to combining the current development needs of our national economy and national defense construction; but for long-term interests, we must also pay attention to the needs of further development in all aspects of mechanics as a discipline itself, so as to be able to adapt to the ever-changing development of national defense construction and the national economy in the future, which will place higher demands on mechanics."

Qian Xuesen also talked about the situation of the mechanics worker team in our country. He said, "Now, the total number of mechanics workers nationwide has reached more than 1,000, which is more than five times the number of representatives attending this academic conference. Representatives from various places have reported that they still lack leadership when carrying out research work. Therefore, the future work should be how to gradually improve the professional level of this vast team so that more new forces can emerge at each subsequent mechanics academic conference, and can have higher academic standards." He said, "He firmly believes that with the support of the Party and the government for science, the leadership of the Academy of Sciences, and the establishment of the Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, this hope can be achieved. Although our current level is backward, we have many favorable conditions that can enable us to progress quickly."

Qian Xuesen praised the spirit of academic discussion at this conference. This was the first domestic academic conference he had attended. He said that in each group meeting, he saw that participants in the discussion put forward sincere, enthusiastic, and realistic opinions on each paper report, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. This kind of discussion spirit is beneficial to the reporter, the discussant, and the listener. He said that many academic conferences he had attended in capitalist countries in the past were not like this; whether it was the person giving the report or the person participating in the discussion, they were only trying to compete and show that they were superior to others.

    钱学森谈参加力学学术报告会的感想
    有些力学论文达到国际水平
    新华社8日讯　今天，著名力学家钱学森对新华社记者谈到他参加正在举行的全国力学学术报告会的感想。
    钱学森说：从这次报告会的结构力学、流体力学、弹性力学、塑性力学、一般力学、自动控制等六个分组会上提出的论文看，差不多每个分组都有几篇论文已经达到国际水平。这就是说，在我国力学的各个领域都已经有了一些很成熟的研究工作者。而其他的一些论文也是我国力学界新生力量努力的结果。这些年轻人提出的论文能拿到力学学术会上报告，可见新生力量成长得很快。他说，当然对他们的论文还不能要求过高。
    钱学森接着说，从这个学术报告会上可以看出，我们对力学这一个学科有些空白的重要方面已经开始注意填补。同时，也反映出中国力学的各个部门的发展是不平衡的。有的部门发展较快，而有些重要的部门却比较薄弱。比如从这次会上的论文看，弹性力学方面的论文最多，塑性力学方面的就少得多，而流体力学方面的论文数量介乎两者之间。可是大家认为流体力学、弹性力学的论文应该是有同样数量的，而塑性力学的工作，也应该比现在的分量重些。当然以后我们要根据各分支的重要性，做到分支间相应的平衡。钱学森说，总的说来，报告会反映出目前力学的实验工作比理论研究薄弱得多，这是因为力学研究还只是在解放后，特别是最近几年才大力开展的，而实验设备要长期的努力才能建立起来。
    钱学森说，力学这门科学是多方面的，它必须要求理论和实际的密切结合。力学工作者不单要掌握理论、实验和计算方法，也要知道工程技术。这也就是说要求力学工作者接触的面很广，熟悉实际产业部门发生的问题，知道如何提炼成为研究对象。这是力学工作者最根本最主要的能力，却也是目前我国一般年轻力学工作者所缺少的。钱学森认为要做到这一点就要求高等学校、科学院和产业部门的力学工作者密切结合起来。这样力学研究事业才会得到很快的发展。
    钱学森谈到今后我国力学研究的发展方向时说：世界各国力学研究方向都是由国民经济和国防建设发展需要所决定的。所以作为一个正在赶上世界水平的后进国家的力学研究工作者，也必须注意结合我国目前国民经济和国防建设的发展需要；但是为了长远的利益，我们也要注意力学这门学科本身各方面进一步发展的需要，以便能适应将来国防建设和国民经济日新月异的发展对力学所提出的要求。
    钱学森还谈到现在我国力学工作者队伍的情况。他说，现在，全国力学工作者总人数已达一千多人，相当于出席这次学术报告会代表的五倍以上。各地代表们反映在展开研究工作时还都缺乏领导力量。因此以后的工作应该是如何逐步提高这支广大队伍的业务水平，使今后每次召开力学学术报告会时，能出现更多的新生力量，而且能有更高的学术水平。他说，他深信在党和政府对科学的支持，和科学院的领导下，以及中国力学学会的成立，这个希望是可以达到的。虽然我们现有的水平是落后的，但是我们有很多有利的条件可以促使我们进步得很快。
    钱学森赞扬了这次报告会上学术讨论的精神。这是他第一次参加的本国的学术报告会。他说在各分组会里，看到参加讨论的人对每篇论文报告都提出了恳切、热烈和实事求是的意见，这是非常可喜的现象。像这种讨论的精神对报告者、讨论者和旁听者都有益处。他说，他过去参加的资本主义国家里的许多学术讨论会却不是这样的，不论是做报告的或是参加讨论的人都只是为了比高低，想显得只有自己比别人高明。
