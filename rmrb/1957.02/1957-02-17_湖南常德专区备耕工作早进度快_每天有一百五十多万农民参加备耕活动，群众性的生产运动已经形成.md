Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 16th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Luo Houren): More than 8,000 agricultural cooperatives in Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, located on the shores of Dongting Lake, are making every effort to prepare for spring ploughing, striving to increase grain production this year by 13% compared to 1956, which saw a slight reduction due to disasters, and by more than 11% compared to the bumper harvest of 1955.

A few days ago, snow and rain fell continuously along the Dongting Lake area. However, wherever I went, I could see thousands upon thousands of farmers accumulating fertilizer, digging pond mud, and engaging in water conservancy projects. The earthwork for the Dongting Lake levee reinforcement, undertaken by more than 80,000 laborers, is nearing completion. Some farmers even put up large slogans like "Defend the Levee, Strive for a Bumper Harvest" on the completed levees, using turf. In addition, members of the agricultural cooperatives are inspecting and collecting seeds, preparing rice paddies, and repairing and oiling farm tools. To support spring ploughing, all 128 ironware handicraft cooperatives in the region have also sent large numbers of personnel to the countryside, setting up farm tool repair stations in various locations. The clang of blacksmiths' forges can be heard day and night in every village and market town.

In the office of the Changde Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, I saw a production and preparation report. This report indicated that more than 1.5 million farmers in various counties are participating in various spring ploughing preparation activities daily, and the preparation work has formed a large-scale mass production movement. So far, an average of more than 60 dan of various mixed fertilizers per mu has been accumulated on the region's 10,790,000 mu of paddy fields. In many places, the amount of fertilizer accumulated exceeds that of the same period last year, with Linli County reaching the highest level, averaging 162 dan per mu. More than 86% of the region's hard land has also been plowed, which is about twice as much as the same period last year. Topdressing fertilizer has been applied to 2,778,000 mu of the 5,440,000 mu of spring-harvested crops. In addition to the imminent completion of the lake area levee reinforcement, 83% of the 85 reservoirs and more than 3,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in the hilly and mountainous areas have also been completed. One hundred and ten pumping stations with a total of 2,600 horsepower have also begun installation. After the completion of these projects, they will be able to eliminate more than 165,000 mu of rain-fed fields and turn 113,000 mu of lakeside wasteland into fertile land.

Sun Yunying, Secretary of the Changde Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, told reporters: This year's production preparation work here started early, is progressing rapidly, and the masses have high enthusiasm for production. This is the result of consolidating agricultural cooperatives with production as the center and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses through rectification of the cooperatives. Last year, 85% of the agricultural cooperatives in this region increased production. However, due to the lack of experience among cadres in the first year of cooperation, there were still some shortcomings in the work, such as coercion, commandism, and subjectivism. In addition, some economic problems left over from last year's advanced cooperation work were not dealt with in a timely manner, and some areas suffered from waterlogging and drought. The income of wealthy cooperative members did not increase much, and their enthusiasm was not high. Therefore, after the autumn harvest distribution, agricultural production in the cooperatives stagnated for a time, and some cooperative members even requested to withdraw from the cooperatives. In December of last year, the Changde Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the county committees sent large numbers of cadres to the countryside to help the agricultural cooperatives carry out rectification and consolidation work. They adopted the method of focusing on doing a good job in winter production, publicizing the superiority of the cooperatives, affirming achievements, conducting criticism and self-criticism, examining and overcoming shortcomings, summarizing the experience and lessons of running cooperatives, and implementing the policy of democratic cooperative management. In this way, the relationship between cadres and the masses began to improve, and winter production work quickly got back on track. Before the rectification of the cooperatives, only more than 200 million dan of fertilizer had been accumulated in the region. During the more than one month of rectification, more than 300 million dan were additionally accumulated. The labor attendance rate of cooperative members also more than doubled compared to before.

At present, the rectification of the cooperatives in the region has basically ended, and the socialist consciousness of both the cooperative cadres and the members has greatly improved. Among the region's more than 1.5 million cooperative member households, except for 313 wealthy farmers who withdrew from the cooperatives, all the rest are determined to run the cooperatives well and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

    湖南常德专区备耕工作早进度快
    每天有一百五十多万农民参加备耕活动，群众性的生产运动已经形成
    新华社长沙16日电　新华社记者罗厚仁报道：湖南省洞庭湖滨常德专区各县八千多个农业社正全力准备春耕，争取今年粮食产量比因灾略有减产的1956年增产13％，比大丰收的1955年增产11％以上。
    前几天，沿洞庭湖一带雪雨连绵，但是，记者不论走到那里，田野里到处都可看见成千上万的农民积肥、挖塘泥和进行兴修水利等活动。现在，有八万多民工从事整修的洞庭湖滨大堤的土方工程快要全部完工了。有些农民在修完的湖堤上用草皮做起了“保卫大堤，争取丰收”的大标语。另外，各农业社社员正在检查收集种籽、准备秧田和修整、油洗农具。全区一百二十八个铁器手工业合作社为了支援春耕，也派了大批人员下乡，在各地设置农具修配站。每天，在各个村落里、集镇上，铁匠炉叮噹的响声，昼夜不停。
    记者在中共常德地委会办公室看到一份生产备耕的汇报表，这份汇报表说明：各县每天有一百五十多万农民参加各种备耕活动，备耕工作已经形成了一个群众性的大生产运动。到目前为止，全区一千零七十九万亩水田平均每亩积有各种混合肥料六十多担，许多地方超过了去年同期积肥的数量，最高的临澧县平均每亩已达一百六十二担。全区的板田，也已翻耕了86％以上，比去年同期要多两倍左右。五百四十四万多亩春收作物，有二百七十七万八千多亩已经施了追肥。冬修水利工程除湖区大堤整修即将完工外，丘陵山区的八十五处水库和三千多处小型农田水利工程也完成了83％，共有二千六百匹马力的一百一十部抽水机也已开始安装。这些工程完工后，能够消灭十六万五千多亩天水田，使十一万三千亩湖荒洼地变成良田。
    中共常德地委书记孙云英对记者说：今年这里的生产备耕工作动手早，进度快，群众生产热情高，这是以生产为中心进行了整顿巩固农业社和通过整社改善了干部与群众关系的结果。去年，这个专区有85％的农业社增产，但是，由于合作化第一年中干部缺乏经验，工作中还存在一些强迫命令和主观主义的缺点，加上去年高级合作化工作中遗留的一些经济问题没有及时处理，部分地区遭受渍涝旱灾，富裕社员收入增加不多，情绪不高，因此，秋收分配后，农业社的生产曾一度停滞，还有一些社员要求退社。去年12月间，中共常德地委和各县委即派了大批干部下乡，帮助农业社进行整顿巩固工作，采取以做好冬季生产为中心的办法，宣传合作社的优越性，肯定成绩，开展批评与自我批评，检查克服缺点和总结办社的经验教训，贯彻民主办社的方针。这样，干部和群众之间的关系开始改善了，冬季生产工作很快地就纳入正轨。整社前，全区只积有两亿多担肥料，在整社期间一个多月内，就增积了三亿多担。社员劳动出勤率也比以前提高了一倍多。
    现在，全区整社工作已经基本结束，社干部和社员的社会主义觉悟都大大提高了。全区一百五十多万户社员中，除三百一十三户富裕农民退社外，其余都坚决要办好合作社，争取今年农业大丰收。
