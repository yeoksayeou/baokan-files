Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has requested cotton purchasing personnel in various regions to seize the next month or two to strive to purchase more cotton.

On the 12th, a relevant person in charge of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives told this reporter that as of January 25th, the national cotton procurement volume was only equivalent to 78.43% of the original procurement plan. Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Liaoning, and Yunnan provinces have overfulfilled the original procurement plan. Other provinces and cities are far from the procurement plan. The major cotton-producing provinces of Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Shaanxi have only completed 60% to 80% of their plans. The time remaining before spring plowing is very short. If more is not procured before spring plowing, it will seriously affect the production of the textile industry, and the tight supply of cotton cloth will still not be alleviated.

The person in charge said that there is still a considerable amount of cotton that can be purchased in rural areas. The main aspects are: First, many agricultural cooperatives still have a batch of publicly owned cotton. Some of this cotton has not been sold because it has not been processed into ginned cotton; some is retained by the cooperatives for their own use; and some cooperatives are concerned that they will not receive cash after returning the cotton pre-purchase deposits, and therefore do not sell cotton in accordance with the pre-purchase contract. According to a survey of nine agricultural cooperatives in the Shangqiu Special District of Henan Province, the cotton stock of agricultural cooperatives accounts for 20% of the total output. More than 20 agricultural cooperatives in Gongxian County, Kaifeng Special District, retained 50,000 to 60,000 jin of bagged cotton. Second, the cotton matured relatively late last year, and many cotton bolls did not open. In some areas, cotton fields had as much as a dozen jin per mu. Some cotton can still be picked by peeling these cotton bolls, and there is also a lot of fallen cotton because the picking was not clean. The Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Duandian, Linfen County, Shanxi Province, has 7,750 mu of cotton fields, and picked 87,000 jin of peeled boll cotton and 9,530 jin of fallen cotton. In Pingyao County, more than 900 people in four villages picked more than 98,000 jin of fallen cotton in half a month. Third, some of the cotton retained by farmers in some areas can still be sold. For example, according to regulations, Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, should have distributed 430,000 jin of cotton to its members, but in reality only 310,000 jin was enough, and the remaining 120,000 jin was sold to the state.

The person in charge said that under these circumstances, the purchasing personnel of the supply and marketing cooperatives should not become discouraged when they see that it is difficult to complete the task, but should actively go to purchase. At the same time, they should change their working methods, go to the countryside with scales and cash for mobile purchases and door-to-door purchases, purchasing one jin if there is one jin, and half a jin if there is half a jin, accumulating small amounts into large amounts. Assistance should be provided to solve the difficulties of agricultural cooperatives in processing ginned cotton and mobilizing members to pick peeled boll cotton. All restrictions on agricultural cooperatives selling cotton to their members should be lifted. In the procurement process, it is necessary to adhere to the method of persuasion and education to mobilize farmers to sell cotton, and the phenomenon of coercion and command that has appeared in some areas should be corrected. In addition, the most important thing is to require local party committees and governments to strengthen leadership and support.

### 棉花收购量距离计划很远  各地棉花采购人员要加紧收购

    棉花收购量距离计划很远
    各地棉花采购人员要加紧收购
    据新华社13日讯　中华全国供销合作总社要求各地棉花采购人员抓紧在最近一两个月内努力多收购一些棉花。
    中华全国供销合作总社有关负责人12日对本社记者说，到1月25日止，全国棉花收购量只相当于原定收购计划的78.43％，湖北、浙江、安徽、湖南、江西、辽宁、云南七省超额完成了原定收购计划，其他省市距收购计划则相差很远，主要产棉省河北、河南、江苏、山西、四川、陕西等省只完成计划的60％到80％。现在离春耕生产时间很短，如果不抓紧在春耕生产以前多收购一些，将会严重地影响到纺织工业的生产，棉布供应的紧张状况仍旧不能得到缓和。
    这位负责人说，目前各地农村还是有相当数量的棉花可以收购，主要的方面有：一、不少农业社还存留了一批公有的棉花，这些棉花有的是由于没有加工成皮棉，尚未卖出；有的是合作社留作自用的；还有一些合作社顾虑归还棉花预购定金后得不到现款，因而不按预购合同规定出售棉花。河南省据商丘专区九个农业社的调查，农业社的存棉量占总产量的20％；开封专区巩县二十多个农业社留有口袋棉五、六万斤。二、去年各地棉花成熟比较晚，有很多棉桃没有开，有的地区一亩棉田多到十几斤，剥开这些棉桃还可以摘下一些棉花，另外因为拣摘不干净，落地棉也不少。山西临汾县段店烽火农业社有棉田七千七百五十亩，摘到剥桃棉八万七千斤，拾到落地棉九千五百三十斤；平遥县有四个村九百多人在半个月内拾到落地棉九万八千多斤。三、有些地区农民的自留棉中还可以卖出一些。如山西汾阳县按规定标准应该分四十三万斤棉花给社员，但实际只分三十一万斤就够了，其余十二万斤就卖给了国家。
    这位负责人说，在这种情况下，供销合作社的收购人员不要看到完成任务有困难，就产生松劲情绪，而要积极去收购，同时改变工作方法，带秤带现款下乡流动收购和上门收购，有一斤就收购一斤，有半斤就收购半斤，聚少成多。对于农业社加工皮棉、动员社员拣摘剥桃棉中的困难，要协助解决。取消农业社对社员出售棉花的一切限制。在收购中必须坚持用说服教育的方法动员农民卖棉，个别地区已经出现的强迫命令现象应该纠正。此外，最重要的是要求当地党委和政府加强领导和支持。
