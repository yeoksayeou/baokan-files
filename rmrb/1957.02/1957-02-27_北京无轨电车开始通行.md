    Beijing Trolleybuses Begin Operation

    (Our newspaper reports) Beijing's trolleybuses began operating yesterday afternoon on the section of line from Fuchengmen to the northern entrance of Beichizi.

    These trolleybuses are all assembled using domestically produced components. The carriages are painted milky yellow, with green curtains hanging on the bright, clean glass windows. The carriages have twenty-eight spring seats, and each bus can accommodate more than eighty people, including both seated and standing passengers.

    The current trial line in operation is 7.76 kilometers long and is the middle section of the entire line from Chaoyangmen to the Western Suburbs Zoo. This year, Beijing initially plans to open three trolleybus lines: one from Chaoyangmen to the Zoo; another from Qianmen to Xidan, exiting through Fuxingmen to the Zoo; and another from Qianmen via Dongjiaomin Lane, Nanheyan to Andingmen. The three lines are a total of twenty-six kilometers long, and ninety-five trolleybuses will run on these lines. (Photo attached)

    北京无轨电车开始通行
    本报讯　北京的无轨电车于昨天下午在阜成门到北池子北口这段线路上开始通行。
    这些无轨电车都是用国产机件装配起来的。车厢里漆成乳黄颜色，明净的玻璃窗上挂着绿色的窗帘，车厢里设有二十八个弹簧座位，车上连坐带站，共可以容纳八十多人。
    目前通车的这段试行线，全长有七点七六公里，是从朝阳门到西郊动物园全线的中间一段。今年北京市初步计划开辟三条无轨电车线路：一条是从朝阳门到动物园；另一条是从前门到西单出复兴门到动物园；还有一条是从前门经东交民巷、南河沿到安定门。三条线路共长二十六公里，行驶在这些线路上的无轨电车将达九十五辆。（附图片）
