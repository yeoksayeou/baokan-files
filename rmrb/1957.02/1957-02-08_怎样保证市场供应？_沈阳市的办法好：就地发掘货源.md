How to Guarantee Market Supply?
	Shenyang's Method is Good: Discovering Local Sources of Goods

    (Reported by this newspaper) Some commercial departments in Shenyang City have changed their thinking of solely relying on a few large cities for the supply of goods. They are using various methods to organize sources of goods from local industrial and handicraft production departments, and have achieved positive results.
    After the employees of Shenyang City Cultural Goods Company conducted in-depth investigations of production units, they discovered that the workers of the First Cultural and Educational Supplies Production Cooperative, which produces set squares, had the technology to produce ballpoint pens, while the Second Cultural and Educational Supplies Production Cooperative, which produces plastic products, had machines that could also produce ballpoint pens. They suggested that they try to produce ballpoint pens, which are in short supply in the market. Now they have successfully trial-produced them. The Dongguan Plastics Second Handicraft Production Cooperative used to produce French curves, set squares, chemical T-squares, and other products. After the cooperative was established, the machine for producing French curves was not in use. The Cultural Goods Company helped them resume production. After Shenyang City Pharmaceutical Company helped Defeng Chemical Factory successfully trial-produce sodium hydride, it solved the difficulty of not being able to buy this commodity in the market in the past. Because Shenyang City Coal and Building Materials Company proactively went to Qingyuan, Liaoyang, Fengcheng, Lushun, and other lime factories, helping them calculate detailed accounts and tap production potential, these factories increased their production.
    The specialized companies in Shenyang City that manage production materials found some urgently needed products in the stagnant materials of some local factories and mines. They also organized various factories and mines to adjust surpluses and shortages, solving the difficulty of some factories and mines not being able to find raw materials. For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, the Chemical Raw Materials Company found 29 kinds of items, such as calcium oxide and phosphoric acid, which were lacking in the market, in the stagnant raw materials of various factories and mines, which greatly helped the production of many related factories.
    After the above-mentioned commercial departments in Shenyang City discovered sources of goods from local production departments through various methods, the tense situation of some products falling short of demand has been eased; in addition to meeting the needs of the local market, some products can also meet the needs of the entire Liaoning Province.

    怎样保证市场供应？
    沈阳市的办法好：就地发掘货源
    本报讯　沈阳市有些商业部门，扭转了单纯依靠几个大城市供应商品的思想，运用各种方法向当地工业、手工业生产部门组织货源，已获得成效。
    沈阳市文化用品公司的职工深入生产单位调查以后，发现第一文教用品生产社生产三角尺的工人，有生产元珠笔的技术，而第二文教用品生产社生产塑胶的机器又能生产元珠笔，便建议他们试制市上缺销的元珠笔，现在已经试制成功。东关塑胶第二手工业生产合作社，过去生产云形规、三角尺、化学丁字尺等产品，合作化以后，生产云形规的机器没有使用。文化用品公司便帮助他们恢复生产。沈阳市医药公司帮助德丰化工厂试制氢化纳成功后，解决了过去在市场上买不到这种商品的困难。沈阳市煤建公司由于主动深入到清原、辽阳、凤城、旅大等石灰厂，帮助它们算细账，挖掘生产潜力，这些厂因此增加了生产量。
    沈阳市经营生产资料的专业公司，在当地一些厂矿的呆滞材料中，找到了一些急需的产品，又组织各厂矿调剂有无，解决了某些厂矿找不到原料的困难。例如去年第四季度化工原料公司在各厂矿的呆滞原料中找到了市场上缺乏的氧化钙、磷酸等二十九种物品，便大大帮助了好些有关工厂的生产。
    沈阳市上述商业部门，通过种种方法向当地生产部门挖掘货源以后，已使某些产品供不应求的紧张情况得到缓和；有的产品除供应本市市场需要以外，还可以供应全辽宁省的需要。　（车轰）
