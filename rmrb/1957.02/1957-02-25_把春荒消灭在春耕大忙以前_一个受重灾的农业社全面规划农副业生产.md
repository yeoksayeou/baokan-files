Eliminate Spring Famine Before the Spring Plowing Rush
An Agricultural Cooperative Severely Affected by Disaster Makes Comprehensive Plans for Agricultural and Sideline Production

　　This newspaper reports: The members of the Dongdafo Agricultural Cooperative in Cuiqiao District, Anyang County, Henan Province, which suffered severe disasters last year, are determined to "thoroughly eliminate the disaster before the spring plowing rush and strive for a bumper harvest this year."

　　After suffering severe disasters last year, this agricultural cooperative actively carried out production for self-salvation. In five months, sideline income exceeded 20,000 yuan, exceeding the original self-salvation plan by 34.9%. At this time, the cooperative cadres developed blind optimism and a relaxed attitude, believing that the disaster problem had been solved. However, the cooperative cadres were not sure whether the disaster had been completely eliminated, whether there were new changes in the ways of sideline production this spring, and whether there would be conflicts between agricultural and sideline production. In order to further clarify the situation and have a clear understanding, the CCP branch of the cooperative discussed and studied with the cooperative cadres, and conducted careful analysis from three aspects: life, production, and labor and animal power.

　　In terms of life, after five months of production for self-salvation, 115 cooperative member households could be self-sufficient and have a slight surplus before the wheat harvest; 39 cooperative member households still had difficulties, which would not be a problem as long as they further carried out production for self-salvation; 39 households still lacked more than 1,000 yuan in living expenses before the wheat harvest due to low income and poor self-salvation ability; and 51 households still needed to rely on relief funds and loans to solve their living problems. In terms of production, 1,600 mu of wheat in the cooperative had not been top-dressed with fertilizer, and 1,100 mu of winter-plowed uncultivated land had not been applied with base fertilizer, and the winter-plowed land had to be harrowed again; the existing 710 large carts of ripe manure had not been sent to the fields; and the preparation of soil fertilizer, burning coal, and chopped straw had not been completed. The preparations for spring plowing production had not yet been completed. In terms of labor and animal power, the cooperative had a total of 521 full and semi-laborers, but only 136 people regularly participated in sideline production, and only 78 people participated in fertilizer accumulation, straw cutting, and other odd jobs. The cooperative had a total of 103 livestock, but only nine were currently used for hauling manure and 36 were used for odd jobs. The cooperative had more than 300 surplus full and semi-laborers, and 58 draught animals had no work to do.

　　After the above analysis, the cadres of the agricultural cooperative knew that the cooperative had not completely overcome the disaster, and that hard struggle was still necessary to eliminate the disaster and strive for a bumper harvest. They immediately made a plan for agricultural and sideline production in two stages: before spring sowing and from spring sowing to the wheat harvest. Before spring sowing, there was not much farm work. In addition to using one-third of the labor force for harrowing, sending manure, accumulating fertilizer, and repairing dikes for preparations for cultivation, the proportion of investment in sideline production should still be increased, and 16 kinds of sideline production activities such as kiln industry, transportation, and workshops should be carried out. It is estimated that the sideline income in the first stage can reach more than 9,400 yuan, and the existing disaster-stricken households will be completely eliminated. After the spring sowing begins, it will gradually enter the busy stage of agricultural production, and 72.6% of the cooperative's labor force will be invested in agricultural production activities, and the remaining labor force will still participate in sideline production.

　　In order to realize the comprehensive agricultural and sideline production self-salvation plan, the agricultural cooperative, in conjunction with the rectification of the cooperative, first implemented the "five guarantees" system, that is, agriculture, sideline, livestock, farm tools, and financial investment were guaranteed to the production team. Secondly, the leadership of the production team was strengthened, and two deputy directors of the cooperative and one deputy branch secretary were drawn to strengthen the leadership of the three weak teams, and it was determined that each team should be led by a deputy team leader in sideline production. At the same time, systems such as planned management, quota management, financial management, and rewards and punishments were also stipulated. After taking these measures, all the cadres and members of the cooperative unanimously stated that they were confident of eliminating the disaster before the spring plowing rush.

### 把春荒消灭在春耕大忙以前  一个受重灾的农业社全面规划农副业生产

    把春荒消灭在春耕大忙以前
    一个受重灾的农业社全面规划农副业生产
    本报讯　去年遭受重灾的河南省安阳县崔桥区东大佛农业社的社员们，决心“把灾荒彻底消灭在春耕大忙之前，努力争取今年大丰收”。
    这个农业社去年遭受重灾后积极进行生产自救，五个月来，副业收入二万多元，超过了原定自救计划的34.9％。这时，社干部便产生了盲目乐观和松劲情绪，认为灾荒问题已经解决了。但是社干部对于是否彻底消灭了灾荒、今春副业生产门路有没有新的变化和农副业生产是否会有矛盾等等问题，心里也没有底。这个社的中共支部为了进一步澄清情况，做到心中有数，和社干部们进行了讨论研究，并从生活、生产和劳动力畜力三方面，进行了仔细的分析。
    在生活方面，全社经过五个月的生产自救，有一百一十五户社员麦收前可以自足和稍有富余；有三十九户社员仍有困难，只要进一步进行生产自救就不成问题；尚有三十九户因收入少和自救能力差，到麦收前还差一千多元的生活费用；还有五十一户要靠救济款和贷款解决生活问题。在生产方面，全社有一千六百亩小麦没有施追肥，冬耕的一千一百亩白地没有施底肥，冬耕地还必须普耙一遍；现存的七百一十大车熟粪也没有送到田间；土肥、烧煤和碎草没有拉完和铡够；春耕生产的准备工作还没有作好。在劳动力畜力方面，全社共五百二十一个全半劳动力，目前经常参加副业生产的只有一百三十六人，参加积肥、铡草等零活的也只有七十八人。全社共一百零三头牲口，目前仅拉粪用着九头，做零活用着三十六头。全社剩余全半劳动力三百多人，五十八头耕畜没有活做。
    这个农业社的干部经过上述的分析后，知道全社并没有彻底战胜灾荒，要消灭灾荒和争取丰收，还必须作艰苦的斗争。他们立即作出了全社春播前和春播至麦收前两个阶段的农副业生产规划。春播前农活不多，除了要用三分之一的劳动力进行耙地、送粪、积肥和修堤等备耕活动外，仍应加大副业投工比例，开展窑业、运输、作坊等十六种副业生产活动。预计前一阶段的副业收入可达九千四百多元，现有灾荒户将彻底消灭。春播开始后，逐渐转入农业生产繁忙阶段，全社72.6％的劳动力要投入农业生产活动，其余的劳动力仍然参加副业生产。
    为了实现农副业全面生产自救规划，这个农业社结合整社，首先实行了“五包”制度，即农业、副业、牲口、农具和财务投资包到生产队。其次，充实生产队的领导，抽出两个副社长和一个副支部书记到三个薄弱的队加强领导，确定各队由一个副队长领导副业生产。同时还规定了计划管理、定额管理、财务管理、奖罚等制度。采取了这些措施以后，全社干部和社员一致表示，春耕大忙前有把握消灭灾荒。
