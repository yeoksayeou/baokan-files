Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 12th: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a decree on February 11th to expand the powers of the Union Republics. It stipulates that the legislative power over the organization of courts and litigation procedures in the Union Republics, as well as the power to pass civil and criminal laws, shall be transferred to the Union Republics, while only the power over the basic principles of these legislations shall remain with the All-Union Soviet Union. At the same time, the power to approve the establishment of new oblasts and krais in the Union Republics will no longer belong to the All-Union, but can be decided by the Union Republics themselves.

After a one-day recess, the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet continued their meetings separately on the morning and evening of this day, and both unanimously passed the above-mentioned two decrees. Due to the changes in the powers of the Soviet Union caused by these two decrees, the relevant parts of the Soviet Constitution were amended accordingly.

When the two houses were deliberating on the decree on transferring the power to decide on the administrative division of oblasts and krais to the Union Republics, members of the Bills Committees of the two houses made reports. Zhuyeva, a member of the Bills Committee of the Council of the Union, said that the transfer of the power to establish oblasts and krais in the Union Republics to the Union Republics themselves shows that the Soviet Union has taken a step forward on the road to expanding the sovereignty of the Union Republics. She pointed out that the multinational Soviet state has always closely linked the establishment of administrative regions with the implementation of the nationalities policy stipulated by Lenin, which must carefully consider the characteristics of all nationalities and safeguard the special interests of all nationalities.

In the discussion in the Council of Nationalities, the Chairman of the Council of Nationalities, Lacis, spoke about the work of cultural development and the training of ethnic cadres in the Union Republics. He said that Uzbekistan, which was almost entirely illiterate in the era of Tsarist rule, now has twice as many people per thousand receiving higher education as France and six times as many as Turkey. In Tajikistan, before the revolution, only one in every two hundred people was literate, and there were a total of ten schools. Now, illiteracy has been eliminated there, and there are more than two thousand six hundred schools.

At this meeting of the Council of Nationalities, the Economic Commission, established on the recommendation of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, was also established. Olga Ivashchenko, a representative from Ukraine, was elected as the chairman of the committee.

At the meetings of the two houses on this day, laws and resolutions on approving the decrees promulgated by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union were also passed. These included: the decree on restoring the national autonomous status of the Balkar, Chechen, Ingush, Kalmyk, and Karachai nationalities; and the decree on abolishing the prosecution system for employees who leave enterprises and institutions without authorization and for absenteeism without justification.

As of this day, five of the seven items on the agenda originally scheduled for discussion at the Supreme Soviet meeting had been completed. The two houses will hold a joint meeting on the 12th to conduct the final two items on the agenda of this meeting: approving the Statute of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union and the issue of the international situation and Soviet foreign policy.

    仔细考虑民族特点　保障民族特殊利益
    苏联最高苏维埃决定扩大加盟共和国职权
    新华社莫斯科12日电　苏联最高苏维埃11日会议通过了扩大加盟共和国职权的法令。规定各加盟共和国法院组织和诉讼程序的立法权以及通过民法和刑法的权限划归各加盟共和国，而只有这些立法的基本原则的权限仍然属于苏联全联盟。同时，各加盟共和国建立新的州和边疆区的批准权也不再属于全联盟，而可以由各加盟共和国自行决定。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议在休会了一天以后，联盟院和民族院在这天上午和晚上分别继续举行会议，并且都一致通过了上述的两个法令。由于这两个法令所引起的苏联权限的改变，法令对苏联宪法的有关部分作了相应的修改。
    两院在进行关于把州和边疆区的行政区划的决定权划归各加盟共和国的法令的时候，两院法案委员会委员作了报告。联盟院法案委员朱耶娃说，现在，把在各加盟共和国设立州和边疆区的职权交给各加盟共和国自己执行，表明苏联在扩大各加盟共和国主权的道路上迈进了一步。她指出，多民族的苏维埃国家对行政区域的设立，是始终跟实行列宁规定的必须仔细考虑到各民族的特点和保障各民族的特殊利益的民族政策紧密地联系在一起的。
    在民族院的讨论上，民族院主席拉齐斯在发言中谈到各加盟共和国文化发展和培养民族干部方面的工作。他说，乌兹别克在沙皇统治的年代几乎全是文盲，现在每千人中受高等教育的人数比法国多一倍，比土耳其多六倍。塔吉克在革命前每二百人中只有一个识字的，总共有十所学校。现在，那里已经扫除了文盲，有二千六百多所学校。
    在民族院的这次会议上，还成立了根据苏共第二十次代表大会的建议设立的经济委员会。乌克兰代表奥利加·伊娃申科当选为委员会主席。
    在两院这天的会议上，还通过了关于批准苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁布的法令的法律和决议。其中包括：关于恢复巴尔卡尔、车臣、印古希、卡尔梅克和卡拉恰伊等民族的民族自治地位的法令；关于取消对擅自离开企业和机关以及无故旷工的职工的起诉制度。
    到这天为止，最高苏维埃会议原定讨论的七项议程已经进行了五项。两院将在12日举行联席会议，进行这次会议的最后两项议程：批准苏联最高法院条例和国际局势和苏联外交政策问题。
