Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd: Coal miners in the four state-owned coal mines in Liaoning Province, namely Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao, responded to the State Council's call and increased production by more than 90,000 tons of raw coal in the three days from January 30 to February 1.

    The attendance rate of miners in each mine during the Spring Festival holiday was very good, and the daily output was also improved compared to usual. The daily output of Fuxin Coal Mine in the three days increased by 9.8% compared to the average in January, and Beipiao Coal Mine increased by 6.6% compared to the average daily output in January.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 3rd: The staff and workers of the seven coal mines under the Harbin Administration of the Ministry of Coal Industry increased coal production for the country by more than 99,000 tons during the Spring Festival holiday. The coal mines under this administration originally planned to mine 82,700 tons of coal during the two-day holiday, but the actual coal production of each mine reached 86,456 tons. At the same time, due to the mines staggering their maintenance time, six coal mines increased production by more than 12,600 tons of coal on January 31.

    According to statistics from six coal mines under the administration, the average attendance rate of coal miners during the Spring Festival holiday production reached 82%. No serious injuries or fatalities occurred during the production process in the entire administration.
Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd: Miners in state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province increased coal production for the country by 65,769 tons during the two days of the Spring Festival holiday. Among them, the coal produced by miners in the four coal mines of Datong, Xishan, Yangquan, and Fenxi during these two days exceeded the original production increase plan. Datong Coal Mine exceeded the plan by 18.5%, and Yangquan Coal Mine exceeded the plan by 31.74%.

    The miners who persisted in production received visits from many responsible persons. Around the Spring Festival, Chen Yu, Minister of the Ministry of Coal Industry, visited the staff and workers of the three coal mines of Xishan, Fenxi, and Yangquan successively.
Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Workers in the coal mines under the Jingsi Mining Bureau produced more than 10,000 tons of coal for the country during the two days of the Spring Festival holiday. The workers of these coal mines responded to the State Council's call to increase coal production with actions that exceeded the two-day coal mining plan by more than 60%.

    During these two days, the attendance rate of workers in each mine reached 100%. The miners showed a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm in production. In many mines, workers transported the mined coal out of the mine before their shift even started. On the second day of the Spring Festival, the workers of Chengzi Coal Mine created the highest daily output in the mine's history, producing more than 1,800 tons of coal for the country. On the same day, the workers of Mentougou Coal Mine produced more than 1,500 tons of coal, exceeding the highest daily output since the resumption of production by more than 400 tons.

    In order not to affect the Spring Festival holiday production, 1,629 mechanical and electrical workers, drivers, technicians, and cadres inspected 33 major mechanical equipment projects before the Spring Festival production. Each mine also organized a large number of personnel to conduct safety inspections throughout the mine area.

    In the first two days of the Spring Festival holiday, the entire mine area transported 13,459 tons of coal to major cities, industrial areas, and coal consumption areas to support industrial construction and the needs of the people's lives.
Xinhua News Agency, Jiaozuo, 3rd: The staff and workers of the coal mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau attended all shifts during the two days of the Spring Festival without taking a holiday, increasing production by more than 8,400 tons of coal.

    During these two days, except for the mines that had to carry out major machine repairs during the Spring Festival, all the mines of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau exceeded their normal output and ensured safety and quality.
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd: The staff and workers of the two largest coal mines in Southwest China, Nantong Coal Mine and Tianfu Coal Mine, persisted in production during the Spring Festival holiday and produced more than 11,900 tons of coal for the country.

    The staff and workers of both coal mines showed great enthusiasm for production during the Spring Festival holiday. The attendance rate of the staff and workers of Nantong Coal Mine reached 100% every day, and many workers who should have been on leave also automatically went to work. Mine directors, engineers, and district heads took turns going down the mine to inspect production and comfort the workers. The technical department also formed three groups for production, safety, and assistance to go down the mine to solve production problems. Doctors also organized mobile teams to go deep into the mine to work. The propaganda and mobilization team composed of family members of this coal mine stayed at the mine entrance in three shifts every day. As soon as a worker who had completed the task well came out of the mine entrance, the family members would put a glorious red flower on him. With the assistance and encouragement of all parties, the workers of this coal mine increased production by more than 6,210 tons of coal during the Spring Festival holiday.

    During the Spring Festival holiday, each shift of Tianfu Coal Mine overfulfilled the plan every day. The staff and workers increased production by 5,782 tons of coal.
Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd: The staff and workers of more than 70 state-owned and local state-owned coal mines in Hunan Province actively responded to the State Council's call and produced a large amount of raw coal during the Spring Festival holiday. According to calculations by the Coal Industry Bureau of the Provincial Department of Industry, local state-owned coal mines throughout the province alone can increase the production of raw coal by 15,000 tons during the holiday.

    During the holiday production of the staff and workers of each coal mine, the leading cadres of the party, government, labor union, and communist youth league departments personally went to the site to direct and comfort them, which greatly encouraged the workers.
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd: The workers of the state-owned Agangzhen Coal Mine and Shmengou Coal Mine in Gansu Province produced 1,400 tons of coal on February 1.
