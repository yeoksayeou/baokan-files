    Helpless

    For a long time, many American politicians and newspapers have expressed anxiety about the increasingly unfavorable situation of the United States in various parts of the world, especially in Asia. But they often don't understand, or pretend not to understand, the reasons why the United States' situation has deteriorated to this point. William O. Douglas, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who recently made an extensive trip to various parts of Asia, seems to have gained some insights in this regard. In a recent speech, he listed several reasons for the poor situation of the United States in Asia.

    Douglas pointed out that there are four forces prevalent in Asia, and the United States is in opposition to them. He said: Asian countries are opposed to feudalism, but the United States has "supported corrupt warlords," thus colluding with colonialism and reactionary leaders; Asian countries have a desire for independence, but the "independence" given by the United States to the Philippines has not gained any prestige; Asian countries have a desire for equality, but the United States is mainly pursuing military alliances and suspects those countries that refuse military alliances; Asian countries yearn for socialism, but the economic ideas of the United States and Asia are incompatible.

    Douglas's analysis cannot be said to be without insight. However, although his observations are accurate, his idea for reversing the declining situation of the United States is not very clever. He advocates shifting the focus of American policy in Asia from military to political, in order to win people's hearts. The people of Asia should be vigilant about this, but the problem facing the United States is by no means just a matter of diplomatic tactics. Can the United States abandon puppets like Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem? Can the United States support the national independence movements of Asian countries to break free from foreign rule? Can the United States abandon military alliances such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization? Can the United States support Asian countries in taking the development path of their own choice? In a word, can the United States change its expansionist and aggressive policy of single-mindedly seeking to dominate Asia? Since it cannot be done, then the reputation of the United States in Asia is destined to continue to decline. Douglas's advice is also futile. (Rui)

    无可奈何
    很久以来，美国的许多政客和报纸就为美国在世界各处、特别是在亚洲的日益不妙的处境表示焦灼不安。但是他们往往弄不明白，或假装弄不明白美国的处境所以落到这种地步的原因。不久前曾到亚洲各地作了一次广泛旅行的美国最高法院院长道格拉斯在这个方面似乎得到了一些启发。他在最近的一次演说中列举了美国在亚洲处境不佳的几个原因。
    道格拉斯指出，在亚洲普遍存在着四种力量，而美国同它们处于对立的地位。他说：亚洲各国是反对封建主义的，但是美国却“支持了腐朽的军阀们”，因而同殖民主义和反动的领袖们沆瀣一气；亚洲各国有着争取独立的愿望，但是美国给予菲律宾“独立”并没有得到什么声望；亚洲各国有着争取平等的愿望，但是美国主要是在追求军事联盟，而怀疑那些拒绝军事联盟的国家；亚洲各国向往社会主义，但美国和亚洲的经济思想却格格不入。
    道格拉斯的这番分析不能说不是颇有见地的。但是，尽管他的所见不差，然而他为挽回美国这种江河日下的处境而出的主意却并不怎样高妙。他主张把美国的亚洲政策的重点从军事转移到政治上去，以收笼络人心之效。亚洲人民应该对这点提高警惕，但美国所面对的问题绝不只是一个外交策略的问题。难道美国能够丢掉蒋介石、李承晚、吴庭艳这些傀儡吗？难道美国能够支持亚洲国家摆脱外国统治的民族独立运动吗？难道美国能够放弃东南亚侵略集团这样的军事联盟吗？难道美国能够支持亚洲国家走它们自己选择的发展道路吗？一句话，美国能够改变它一心要独霸亚洲的扩张侵略政策吗？既然办不到，那么美国在亚洲的声名就注定要继续低落下去。道格拉斯的献策也是无济于事的。　（瑞）
