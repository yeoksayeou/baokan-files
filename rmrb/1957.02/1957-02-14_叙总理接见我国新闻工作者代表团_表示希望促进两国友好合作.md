Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, February 13th: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali, when receiving the Chinese journalists delegation here yesterday, said, "The position of the liberated Arab countries is well known. They will not deviate from the neutral path of implementing a neutral policy in the Middle East. Syria's general policy is not to be attached to any side in the struggle between East and West. Syria will never deviate from the policy of active neutrality adopted a few years ago." He said, because "we believe that by pursuing this policy, we can realize our political aspirations for independence, freedom, and sovereignty. We also believe that by pursuing this policy, we will not become a source of disputes, whether to the East or to the West, and if this policy is implemented, it will drive away the shadow of a new war and bring peace and prosperity to this region."

Al-Asali said, "There is great potential for economic and cultural cooperation between China and Syria. This cooperation, coupled with the exchange of views and cooperation in international affairs, will establish better understanding and promote world peace and the welfare of our two peoples. We are very concerned about realizing this wish, and hope that this will become our common goal and practice."

Al-Asali said that what Syria and China have in common cannot be other than a love of peace, the right to self-determination, and avoidance of a third world war. Their common aspirations will help their people build a better future and build prosperity for all mankind.

The Prime Minister also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and people for their support of the Arab cause, and praised the great achievements of the Chinese people in construction and the lofty goals of the Chinese government, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other Chinese leaders.

The Chinese journalists presented gifts to the Prime Minister to express their gratitude and respect to the Syrian government and people.

Earlier that morning, the delegation called on Foreign Minister Bitar. In his conversation, Bitar asked the Chinese journalists to convey the friendly feelings and respect of the Arab people to the Chinese people.

    叙总理接见我国新闻工作者代表团
    表示希望促进两国友好合作
    据新华社大马士革13日电　叙利亚总理阿萨利昨天在这里接见中国新闻工作者代表团时说，“解放了的阿拉伯国家的立场是众所周知的。它们不会离开在中东实行中立政策的中立道路。叙利亚的总的政策是不依附于东方和西方斗争中的任何一方。叙利亚决不脱离在几年前采取的积极的中立政策。”他说，因为“我们相信，奉行这个政策，我们能够实现我们对独立、自由和主权的政治愿望。我们还相信，奉行这个政策，我们不会成为纠纷的根源，不论是对东方还是对西方，并且如果执行了这个政策，就会驱走新战争的阴影和给这个地区带来和平和繁荣”。
    阿萨利说，“在中国和叙利亚之间存在着经济和文化合作的巨大可能性。这种合作再加上在国际事务中交换意见和合作，就会建立更好的谅解并且促进世界和平和我们两国人民的福利。我们非常关心实现这个愿望，并且希望这将成为我们共同的目标和实践”。
    阿萨利说，叙利亚和中国的共同点不能不是为了爱好和平、自决权和避免第三次世界大战。它们的共同愿望将有助于它们人民建立更美好的前途和为全人类建立繁荣。
    这位总理还对中国政府和人民支持阿拉伯事业表示感谢，并且赞扬中国人民在建设中的伟大成就和中国政府、毛泽东主席和其它中国领袖们所抱的崇高目标。
    中国新闻工作者们向总理赠送了礼物，以表示对叙利亚政府和人民的感谢和敬意。
    当天上午早些时候，代表团拜会了外交部长比塔尔。比塔尔在谈话中要求中国新闻工作者们把阿拉伯人民的友好感情和敬意转达给中国人民。
