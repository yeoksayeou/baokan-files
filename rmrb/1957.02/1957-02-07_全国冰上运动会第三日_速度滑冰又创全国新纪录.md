    全国冰上运动会第三日
    速度滑冰又创全国新纪录
    新华社齐齐哈尔6日电　1957年全国冰上运动会今天已经进入第三天的比赛，齐齐哈尔的运动员李太权以九分零秒八的成绩，打破了男子五千公尺速度滑冰九分三秒二的全国纪录。
    今天齐齐哈尔的风比前两天更大，但是李太权在比赛时仍旧飞快地滑跑前进。到了最后一圈，观众曾以热烈的喝采声来鼓舞他，因此他终于打破了全国纪录。在他以后的五名运动员是：齐齐哈尔的傅锡珠，哈尔滨的张鹏瑞，沈阳的全灿实，哈尔滨的张绍君和柳元用（原名柳元龙）。
    今天还举行了男子五百公尺速度滑冰比赛。哈尔滨的杨菊成获得第一名，成绩是四十七秒五（全国纪录是四十六秒五）。在他以后的是齐齐哈尔的杨景清，沈阳的全灿实，李太权和长春的姜应星（他们的成绩都是四十八秒八），以及哈尔滨的张兴才。
    女子花样滑冰比赛也在今天开始。穿着红绿衣裙的女运动员们给冰场生色不少。十二岁的小运动员吕雅群和另一名女运动员那景华是母女俩，她们今天分别参加了乙组和甲组的比赛。甲组和乙组的冰球队今天也开始了决赛。
