    The Yunnan Daily Editorial Department reports: The Luquan County Gunpowder Processing Plant in Yunnan Province has started from scratch through diligence and thrift. In the past six months, it has produced more than 30,000 jin of black powder and accumulated more than 4,000 yuan in funds.
    Last year, after the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, Luquan County actively carried out construction such as building roads and constructing water conservancy projects. At that time, it was estimated that more than 200,000 jin of explosives would be needed for the whole year, but the supply could not keep up. Therefore, the county decided to build a small gunpowder plant on its own. At that time, only two cadres were transferred, and several technicians with experience in indigenous methods of refining saltpeter and ten workers were found to prepare for the construction of the factory. Without a factory building, they exchanged a house with farmers for a public house in the village to be used as a factory building; they borrowed 2,500 yuan from the county finance section as funds. The staff and workers also took advantage of the time when raw materials were temporarily in short supply to build their own mill, workshop, and warehouse.
    In production, the staff and workers paid great attention to conservation. They used old wooden boxes to pack finished products, and tried to filter out useful parts from the saltpeter slag, refining more than 300 jin of saltpeter. As a result, the cost of black powder per kilogram in this factory was 30% lower than that of other chemical factories. Now, the loan at the time of construction has been repaid, and the staff and workers are confidently striving to produce more, better, and cheaper gunpowder this year.

    火药加工厂勤俭起家
    本报讯　云南省禄劝县火药加工厂勤俭起家，半年来生产了三万多斤黑色炸药，积累了四千多元资金。
    去年，农业合作化高潮来到以后，禄劝县积极进行修筑公路，兴修水利等建设。当时估计全年需用二十多万斤炸药，但是供应不上。县里于是决定自建一个小型火药厂。当时只调了两个干部，找了几个有土法熬火硝经验的技术人员和十个工人筹建工厂。没有厂房，就利用村上的公房向农民交换了一处房屋做厂房；向县财政科借了二千五百元做资金。职工们还利用原料暂时供不上的时间自己修了碾房、车间和仓库。
    在生产中，职工们很注意节约。他们用旧木箱包装成品，从火硝渣子里设法滤出有用的部分，熬出了三百多斤火硝，因而这个厂的黑火药每公斤成本比其它化工厂低30％。现在，建厂时借款已经还清，职工们正在满怀信心地争取今年生产更多更好更便宜的火药。
