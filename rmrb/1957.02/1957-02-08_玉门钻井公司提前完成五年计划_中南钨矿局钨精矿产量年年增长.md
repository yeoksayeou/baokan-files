Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 7th: The Yumen Oil Mine Drilling Company has completed its first Five-Year Plan's drilling footage task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. From 1953 to the end of January this year, the total drilling footage of this company is equal to ten times the total drilling footage of the Yumen Oil Mine in the fourteen years from 1939 to 1952.

Since the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, the Drilling Company has continuously improved the technical level of drilling workers by adopting methods such as signing apprenticeship contracts and running technical training courses. Now, drilling workers have mastered the technology of drilling deep oil exploration wells over 3,000 meters deep; while in 1952, the deepest oil exploration well in the country was only over 2,000 meters. In 1952, the average monthly drilling speed of each drilling rig in this company was 149.8 meters, which reached more than 538 meters in 1956, and the best drilling team reached more than 1,100 meters. In 1955, only the most outstanding oil drilling team in the country achieved a record of more than 5,000 meters of drilling footage for the whole year, while last year, there were nineteen drilling teams in this company that drilled more than 5,000 meters for the whole year, among which the 3203 drilling team drilled as much as more than 10,000 meters. In addition, drilling workers have also learned to use turbine drills to drill new technologies for drilling straight oil wells, deviated wells, and double-barrel wells. Rich experience has also been gained in the well team's "fast relocation," "fast drilling," and the use of different drill bits for drilling according to different geological conditions.

Due to the improvement of technical level and the acceleration of drilling speed of drilling workers, it has played a significant role in rapidly increasing the production of oil wells, exploring the oil-bearing conditions and geological conditions of oil-bearing structures. For example, as a result of drilling by the Drilling Company on six oil-bearing structures and buried structures last year, except for one structure whose geological conditions were explored, oil and gas shows, crude oil, and new oil-producing layers were discovered in the remaining five structures.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 7th: The Central South Tungsten Mine Bureau's tungsten concentrate output has increased annually during the implementation of the country's first Five-Year Plan. The bureau's tungsten concentrate output in 1956 increased by 150.3% compared with 1952. In 1956, the bureau overfulfilled the annual total output value, tungsten concentrate output, and labor productivity plans.

In recent years, all employees of the Central South Tungsten Mine Bureau have implemented the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and extensively and deeply carried out socialist emulation. In the competition, they grasped the central link of summarizing and promoting advanced experience, so that various technical and economic indicators were improved. In 1956, the Central South Tungsten Mine Bureau studied, summarized, and promoted more than 120 important advanced experiences in mining, mineral processing, tunneling, and enterprise management. After the Huameishan Mine implemented advanced experiences such as controlling mining width and rapid track delivery, it eliminated the long-standing weak links in mining, transportation, and mineral processing. After the Pangu Mountain Mine implemented advanced experiences such as shaking table classification and washing, the mineral processing recovery rate increased by 15%. Technicians and staff also carried out office competitions, went deep into the front line, and solved many key problems in production technology and enterprise management; in the advanced producer movement, many backward units have been transformed. The Huameishan Mine had failed to complete the national plan for more than ten consecutive months before 1956, but after the first quarter of 1956, it continuously completed the national plan.

    玉门钻井公司提前完成五年计划
    中南钨矿局钨精矿产量年年增长
    新华社玉门7日电　玉门油矿钻井公司提前超额完成了第一个五年计划的钻井进尺任务。这个公司从1953年到今年1月底，钻井进尺的总数等于玉门油矿从1939年到1952年这十四年间钻井进尺总和的十倍。
    钻井公司在执行第一个五年计划以来，采用签订师徒合同、办技术训练班等办法，不断提高钻井工人的技术水平。现在，钻井工人已经掌握了钻凿深达三千公尺以上的石油深探井的技术；而1952年全国最深的石油探井仅仅两千多公尺。这个公司在1952年平均每台钻机每月钻进速度是一百四十九点八公尺，1956年达到五百三十八公尺多，最好的钻井队达到一千一百多公尺。1955年全国只有最优秀的石油钻井队达到了全年钻井进尺五千多公尺的纪录，而去年这个公司全年钻进五千公尺以上的钻井队就有十九个，其中三二零三钻井队的全年钻进进尺高达一万多公尺。此外，钻井工人还学会了使用涡轮钻具钻凿石油直井、斜向井和双筒井的新技术。在井队“快速搬家”、“快速钻井”和根据不同地质情况使用不同钻头钻进等技术方面，也都取得了丰富的经验。
    钻井工人由于技术水平提高、钻井速度加快，对于迅速增加生产井增产原油、探明储油构造的含油情况和地质情况等方面，都起了重大作用。如去年钻井公司在六个储油构造和潜伏构造上钻探的结果，除了有一个构造探明地质情况以外，其余五个构造都发现了油气显示、原油和新的产油层。
    新华社南昌7日电　中南钨矿局在执行国家第一个五年计划中，钨精矿产量年年增长。全局1956年钨精矿产量比1952年提高了150.3％。全局在1956年，超额完成了全年总产值、钨精矿产量和劳动生产率计划。
    几年来，中南钨矿局全体职工贯彻执行了“多、快、好、省”的方针，广泛深入地开展了社会主义竞赛。在竞赛中抓住了总结和推广先进经验这一中心环节，使各项技术经济指标获得提高。1956年，中南钨矿局在采矿、选矿、掘进以及企业管理等方面，共研究、总结和推广了一百二十多项重要的先进经验。画眉?矿在推行了控制采幅和快速送道等先进经验以后，消除了长期存在的采矿、运输和选矿中间的薄弱环节。盘古山矿推行摇床分级洗选等先进经验以后，选矿收回率提高了15％。技术人员和职员也开展了科室竞赛，深入现场，解决了生产技术和企业管理上的许多关键问题；在先进生产者运动中，许多落后的单位有了转变。画眉?矿1956年以前连续十几个月未完成国家计划，1956年第一季度以后，连续完成国家计划。
