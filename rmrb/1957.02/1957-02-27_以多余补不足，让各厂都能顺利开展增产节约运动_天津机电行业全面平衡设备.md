Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 25th. For nearly two months, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry has balanced the production man-hours and machine-hours of more than 200,000 products from 272 factories, alleviating the urgent situation in which companies and factories were idle due to a shortage of raw materials, or unable to complete tasks due to a lack of equipment and types of work.

Tianjin's local mechanical and electrical industry's production equipment is outdated, and there is a lack of various precision and large machine tools. No factory can fully undertake the production of complete sets of machines. Due to the increased quality and specification requirements of most products, and the tight supply of major raw materials such as steel and coke, most factories had insufficient or surplus production man-hours and machine-hours when arranging this year's production tasks, affecting the development of the increase production and practice economy movement in many factories. On the basis of investigating the use of production equipment, man-hours, and machine-hours in various factories in December last year, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry began to balance the equipment, types of work, and man-hours of various factories within the overall bureau in January this year. The elevator factory had a batch of freight elevator tasks in the first quarter to support key construction areas and units, which greatly exceeded the factory's equipment and man-hour capacity. It was decided that the crane machinery factory and other factories with sufficient equipment and man-hours would produce parts such as elevator tracks and safety wedges, so that this batch of products could be delivered one month ahead of schedule. The Tianjin Vehicle Tool Industry Company accepted the task of producing 30,000 handcarts to support farmers in disaster areas in February this year, which were assigned to the rickshaw axle factory and axle skin factory for production. Due to the limitations of equipment and man-hours in these two factories, many parts could not be manufactured. The Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry and the Vehicle Tool Industry Company decided to balance 40,000 axle skin discs, 40,000 axle bowls, and five-cent axle rods to factories such as the Metrology Factory and the Center Axle Factory, which had insufficient tasks and surplus equipment. The Machine Tool Factory accepted the production task of three steel pushers required for the basic construction of the Fushun Steel Plant in November 1955. Because there were no heavy-duty precision lathes, it was impossible to process a type of pusher rod weighing more than one ton on the steel pusher. Recently, it was arranged to the Forging Press Machine Tool Factory, so that this problem that had been delayed for more than a year was resolved.

    以多余补不足，让各厂都能顺利开展增产节约运动
    天津机电行业全面平衡设备
    新华社天津25日电　近两个多月以来，天津市机电工业局平衡了二百七十二个工厂的二十多万件产品的生产工时和台时，使公司、厂因缺少原材料造成窝工待活，或因缺少设备与工种不能完成任务的紧迫情况得到缓和。
    天津市地方机电工业的生产设备陈旧，各种精密、大型的机床缺乏，没有一个工厂能够全部担负起成套机器的生产。由于大部分产品质量规格要求的提高，以及钢铁焦炭等主要原材料供应紧张，在安排今年的生产任务时大部分厂的生产工时和台时有的不足，有的有多余，影响到许多工厂增产节约运动的开展。天津市机电工业局在去年12月份对各厂的生产设备、工时和台时的使用情况进行了调查的基础上，从今年1月开始，就在全局范围内平衡各厂的设备、工种和工时。电梯厂第一季度有一批支援重点建设地区和单位的载货电梯的任务，大大超过了这个工厂的设备和工时的能力，决定由设备和工时充裕的起重机械厂等工厂生产电梯的跑道和保险楔等零件，使这批产品可以提前一个月交货。天津市车具工业公司今年2月份接受了三万辆支援灾区农民生产的手推车的任务，布置给人力车轴厂和轴皮厂生产，因为这两个厂的设备和工时的限制，有许多零件不能制造，市机电工业局和车具工业公司就决定把四万个轴皮盘、四万个轴碗，以及五分轴棍等零件，平衡给度量衡厂、中轴厂等一些任务不足、设备有余的工厂。机床厂1955年11月曾经接受抚顺钢厂基本建设需要的三台推钢机的生产任务，因为没有重型的精密旋床，不能加工推钢机上的一种一吨多重的推杆，最近安排给锻压机床厂以后，使这个拖了一年多的问题得到解决。
