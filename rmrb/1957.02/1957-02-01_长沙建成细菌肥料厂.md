Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 29th. The Hunan Provincial Local State-Owned Bacterial Fertilizer Plant has been completed in the suburbs of Changsha City. It will soon begin mass production of green manure Rhizobium inoculant, peanut Rhizobium inoculant, and experimentally produce Azotobacter inoculant.

Bacterial fertilizer has good effects. According to the results of the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station's four years of key promotion, the yield of green manure using Rhizobium inoculant of vetch and purple cloud clover can be increased by 30-40% to 2-3 times; the use of peanut Rhizobium inoculant can increase peanut production by an average of 30 jin per mu compared to using manure alone.

Rhizobium is taken from the root nodules of various leguminous plants. After it is cultivated and mixed with grass ash, it becomes a black, moist powder, which is Rhizobium inoculant. This year, the factory will produce 25,000 bottles of green manure Rhizobium inoculant, which can be used for inoculation of 500,000 mu of green manure; it will produce 12,000 bottles of peanut Rhizobium inoculant, which can be used for inoculation of 120,000 mu of peanuts.

In addition to the bacterial fertilizer plant, Hunan Province has also built 76 fertilizer plants for superphosphate, bone meal, and granular fertilizer. This year, these plants will produce more than 440,000 tons of fertilizer for farmers throughout the province.

    长沙建成细菌肥料厂
    新华社长沙29日电　湖南省地方国营细菌肥料厂已经在长沙市郊建成，不久就要大量生产绿肥根瘤菌剂、花生根瘤菌剂和试验性地生产自生固氮菌剂。
    细菌肥料效果好。据湖南省农业综合试验站四年来重点推广的结果，使用苕子、紫云英两种草的根瘤菌剂拌种的绿肥，产量可以增加三、四成到二、三倍；使用花生根瘤菌剂拌种，平均每亩花生能比单用粪肥增产三十斤。
    根瘤菌是从各种豆科植物的根瘤上取来的，把它加以培养以后混合在草灰上，成为黑色的潮湿粉剂，就是根瘤菌剂。今年这个厂将生产绿肥根瘤菌剂二万五千瓶，能供五十万亩绿肥拌种用；生产花生根瘤菌剂一万二千瓶，能供十二万亩花生拌种用。
    湖南省除了细菌肥料厂以外，还先后建成了过磷酸钙、骨粉、颗粒肥料等七十六个肥料厂，今年这些厂将为全省农民生产四十四万多吨肥料。
