Xinhua News Agency report: Tianjin's medical and health circles recently held the first medical and health academic discussion meeting. At the meeting, more than 250 academic papers were presented in twelve academic societies covering internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and hygiene.

The vast majority of papers submitted this time dealt with some practical problems that need to be solved in current clinical practice. Some medical experts put forward new insights into clinical treatment based on years of clinical experience. The paper "Eosinophilic Proliferative Lymphogranulomatosis" presented by tumor expert Jin Xianzai and others not only discovered a disease that has not been seen in domestic and foreign literature, but also developed effective treatment methods.

Dr. Jin Xianzai and others have been studying 23 such cases in detail since 1937. They found that this disease is not rare. The main symptoms are lumps on the face, rough skin, and itching. If this disease is not treated, the lumps will grow larger and larger, some as large as the head, and the skin will gradually turn black. Dr. Jin Xianzai and others adopted a method of surgical resection combined with X-ray irradiation to cure the disease. According to long-term observation of these 23 cases, there has been no recurrence in the affected area after treatment. Tumor experts from Beijing, Shanghai and other places believe that this paper is of great value to the study of tumor diseases.

Several papers on tuberculous meningitis in children presented by Tianjin Children's Hospital and other units unanimously affirmed that spinal canal injection of streptomycin is not necessary for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis in children. Because the above method not only increases the pain of multiple spinal punctures for the patient, but also causes various neurological complications.

In the field of industrial hygiene, academic papers on lead poisoning, benzene poisoning, and occupational pneumoconiosis in dust industries put forward many specific methods and opinions on improving workers' working conditions and reducing workers' labor intensity.

The papers submitted this time were all completed by medical and health workers in the past year. At present, medical and health workers in Tianjin have submitted more than 480 research topics for 1957.

    天津医药卫生界学术研究活跃
    据新华社讯　天津市最近举行了第一届医药卫生学术讨论会，会上提出了内科、外科、妇产科和卫生等十二个学会方面的二百五十多篇学术论文。
    这次提出的绝大多数论文都涉及到目前临床中需要解决的一些实际问题。有些医学专家根据多年的临床经验提出了临床治疗的新见解。肿瘤科专家金显宅等人提出的“嗜伊红细胞性增生性淋巴肉芽肿”论文，不但发现了一种在国内外文献上还没有看到的疾病，同时还研究出有效的治疗方法。
    金显宅大夫等人从1937年以来详细地研究了二十三个这种病例。发现这种病并非罕见，主要的症状是在脸部长有肿块、皮肤粗糙、发痒等。这种病如果不治疗，肿块会越长越大，有的长得和头部一样大，而且皮肤也会逐渐发黑。金显宅大夫等采用了手术切除合并爱克斯线照射治疗的方法，使这种疾病可以治愈。根据对这二十三个病例的长期观察，治疗后患部没有复发的情形。北京、上海等地来的肿瘤科专家们认为这篇论文对肿瘤病的研究有很大的价值。
    天津市儿童医院等单位提出的有关小儿结核性脑膜炎的几篇论文，一致肯定了治疗小儿结核性脑膜炎，可以不用脊椎管中注射链霉素的方法。因为用上述的方法，病人不但增加了多次脊椎刺穿的痛苦，而且会使患者引起种种神经系统的合并症。
    在工业卫生方面，有关论述铅中毒、苯中毒和粉尘工业职业性肺病等问题的学术论文，提出了许多改进工人劳动条件、减轻工人劳动强度等方面的具体方法和意见。
    这次提出的论文都是医药卫生工作者在近一年来完成的。目前，天津市的医药卫生工作者提出的1957年的研究题目已经有四百八十多个。
