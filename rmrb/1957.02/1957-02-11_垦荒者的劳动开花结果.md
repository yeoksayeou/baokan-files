The boundless wilderness is covered with 220,000 hectares of land suitable for high-yield and yield-guaranteed crops such as soybeans, sorghum, and corn. Further from the villages, there are still 130,000 hectares of wasteland suitable for mechanical reclamation, sowing grains, and developing animal husbandry. The crisscrossing Yalu River and other nine rivers not only provide people with fishery production but, after water conservancy projects are built, can also irrigate a large amount of paddy fields that can produce more than 1,000 catties per mu. Hundreds of kinds of sideline production can account for 20% to 40% of the total agricultural income each year. This land is located in the "Great Northern Wilderness," adjacent to the Hulunbuir League of Inner Mongolia, and belongs to Longjiang County, one of the important agricultural counties in Heilongjiang Province.

	The Reward Given by the Land
In the spring of last year, 4,075 young and middle-aged reclamation team members from Shandong and other places awakened this sleeping fertile land. They sowed various crops on the more than 9,000 hectares of land they opened up, totaling 6,830 hectares. The reclamation workers also carried out a variety of sideline activities. A year of hard work has already borne fruit. Last year, they produced more than 8,000 tons of grain, and sideline income reached 200,000 yuan. Among the seventeen new villages established by reclamation workers in the county, there are six new villages where the average per capita income from agricultural and sideline industries can reach about 350 yuan; five new villages with about 250 yuan; and six new villages with about 200 yuan. Generally speaking, the actual income of most people is around 300 yuan.

The state requires reclamation workers to produce enough to eat in one year, have a surplus in two years, and become prosperous in three years. And their actual income in the first year has already reached or exceeded the level of the second year.

Last October, in the season of abundant harvests, we came to Longjiang County to understand the county's reclamation and production work and to visit the people who are developing the wilderness of the motherland.

The clear sky is without a trace of floating clouds, the flat and fertile land stretches as far as the eye can see, and the newly built houses that make up the villages have been connected to the original villages. The fields are filled with the fragrance of grain everywhere. Teams of large carts loaded with crops are running on the field roads and highways. This scene of harvest almost makes us forget that less than a year ago, this was still a wild grassland overgrown with weeds.

We came to the Fourth New Village
The 154 reclamation team members of the Fourth New Village cultivated 332 hectares of land, which can yield more than 958,000 catties of grain, more than 170,000 catties of vegetables, and more than 300,000 catties of hay; and there are more than 6,000 yuan in sideline income. The average net income per capita from agriculture and sideline industries can reach 300 yuan. Thirty people can receive 460 yuan. More than 96% of the villagers have increased their income compared with their hometown, and those whose income has increased by one to one and a half times account for more than 80%.

The new village office and the reclamation workers' dormitories were silent. We crossed the sports field, bypassed the large stable that can tether two to three hundred horses, the poultry farm, and walked to the entrance of the collective canteen, where four women were busy pickling vegetables.

"Can you finish pickling so many vegetables?" I asked, pointing to a row of a dozen large jars.

"The young lads can eat a lot! Some people's families are coming soon, and this little bit of pickled vegetables is not enough!" A middle-aged woman pointed to a place about twenty meters away and said, "Those are three large vegetable cellars, filled with radishes, cabbage, and potatoes. Our director said: We must let everyone eat fresh vegetables all year round."

She wiped her hands with her white apron and picked up a radish from the vegetable pile. "This is not the biggest, but it weighs three catties. Comrade, cut it open and taste it!" After she finished speaking, she handed me the radish.

At this time, the kitchen door opened. The cooks were picking up large white steamed buns from the steamer into baskets. A large pot of fragrant vegetables—potatoes, cabbage, and vermicelli—simmered with a bubbling sound. We learned from them that they have one stewed dish and one stir-fried dish every day, not only eating soybean oil, but also lard. They slaughter a big fat pig weighing two hundred catties every month to improve their lives.

The reclamation workers can have such a life, which they have gained from arduous struggles. But it is also inseparable from the strong support of the state and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people. Even in the season of ice and snow, the county's party and government leading organs organized cadres to survey the land and plan the village sites for the reclamation workers. The local people automatically lent more than 900,000 adobe bricks, more than 4,000 meters of foundation stones, and voluntarily helped them build houses. The state invested and loaned more than 1.74 million yuan to help them purchase livestock, carts, and various large and small agricultural tools, as well as seeds, food, horse feed, and clothing. All of these laid a good material foundation for the reclamation workers to advance to the wasteland.

"Today and the past are exactly reversed"
When the second production team was resting in the fields, we met Sun Shanyuan, a 46-year-old reclamation team member. He had lived in the Northeast for a long time in the past. At that time, he came from Shandong to escape famine, and the traces of his labor are still preserved in the "Great Northern Wilderness." After several applications, the government approved his return to this land that he had been away from for many years. He told us about the past.

"In the past, in Shandong, there was no place to use strength, and there was no firewood to burn in spring and winter. A family of old and young worked hard for a year, and as a result, they couldn't eat enough or dress warmly. There was no way, so they had to leave their homes and seek a living thousands of miles away. Many people came to 'Guandong' carrying burdens. When they got here, they were unfamiliar with the place and had no relatives to rely on. They still had to work for the landlords and be exploited by them, living a life worse than cattle and horses all year round."

He then talked about the present, and said meaningfully: "Today and the past are exactly reversed. In the past, we were fleeing famine and begging for food; today, we are doing it for socialism."

	Any difficulties can be overcome
Zhen Qingfang, the women's production team leader, came to the "Great Northern Wilderness" with her husband, Wu Huatian, last spring. After less than a year of hard work, the two of them can receive 15,000 catties of grain, equivalent to 900 yuan. When she was in Shandong, a family of four and a half people could only harvest more than 2,000 catties a year, and they were always short of food for two and a half months of the year. She is already very satisfied with her current living conditions. She said: "Working here for a year is better than working hard at home for several years. After we came here, we have already made several advance distributions. Look," she pointed to the new quilt on the bed, the new overcoat hanging on the wall, the new velvet coat and new cotton-padded jacket and pants she was wearing, the new Warrior sneakers on her feet, the furniture in the room, and other daily necessities, and said happily: "If we were in our hometown, we would have to wait several years before we could afford these things."

"Do you have any difficulties in production or life?" we asked.

"Difficulties, that depends on how you say it. Compared with when we first came in the spring, what is there to say now?" She introduced to us in great detail the scene when she first arrived in the "Great Northern Wilderness."

It was in March, when the grassland had not yet shed its winter clothes, and the ground was frozen solid, making it difficult to work. Some houses had not yet been completed, and some people had to live in shacks temporarily. Some women ran to the nearby old commune to live every day. They were not used to living on the opposite kang and eating whole-grain meals. Some people had never seen large new agricultural implements before, let alone knowing how to use them. There were many market towns in Shandong, and the masses went to the market twice a month. The "Great Northern Wilderness" was a vast grassland, not to mention a market, even visiting a familiar person would require running for ten or twenty miles. In short, everything from what to eat, wear, use, hear, and see was different from Shandong. In Zhen Qingfang's words, "It was extremely awkward."

When we asked her how they overcame these difficulties, she said: "No matter how great the difficulties we encounter, as long as we remember that we are standing on the front line of labor production, carrying out the tasks assigned to us by the motherland and the people, we feel an endless amount of strength in our bodies. On the second day we arrived here, everyone started working. ... We overcame one obstacle after another. The autumn harvest was the most tense stage. Our village planted a lot of land this year, and it was a bumper harvest, but we didn't have enough manpower. If the heavens had brought heavy snow early, the crops would have been buried by the snow, and that would have been terrible. But people always have a way. We worked at night by the moonlight. The 150 hectares of corn in our village were all harvested at night."

"That's too hard!" we said.

"Hard work? Our director is right! In order to bring the grains home, we must be ahead of time." She paused and then continued: "Everyone has gotten used to everything, and the difficulties have been overcome. In the past, we were not used to eating whole-grain meals, but now we crave cornmeal, sorghum rice, and dried bean curd after not eating them for three days. However, we want to build socialism in the 'Great Northern Wilderness', and we will encounter difficulties in the future, but we are not afraid!" (Attached picture)

    垦荒者的劳动开花结果
    于廷栋
    一望无边的原野，平铺着二十二万公顷适于大豆、高粱、玉米等高产、保产作物生长的土地。离村屯较远的地方，还沉睡着十三万公顷适合机械开垦、播种五谷和发展畜牧业的荒原。纵横交错的鸭绿江等九条河流，不仅可供人们从事渔业生产；兴修水利以后，还可以灌溉大量每亩可产千斤以上的稻田。千百种的副业生产，每年收入可占农业总收入的20％到40％。这块土地坐落在“北大荒”上，和内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟相毗邻，属于黑龙江省重要农业县份之一的龙江县。
      土地给予的酬谢
    去年春季，来自山东等地的四千零七十五名青壮年垦荒队员唤醒了这块沉睡着的肥沃的土地。他们在开出的九千多垧土地上，播种各种庄稼六千八百三十垧。垦荒者们还开展了多种多样的副业活动。一年的辛勤劳动已经开花结果，去年生产粮食八千多吨，副业收入可达二十万元。在全县由垦荒者们建立的十七个新村中，农副业收入平均每人能到三百五十元左右的有六个新村；二百五十元左右的有五个新村；二百元左右的有六个新村。总的说来，多数人的实际收入都在三百元左右。
    国家要求垦荒者们一年生产够吃，两年生产有余，三年生产富裕。而他们第一年的实际收入，已经达到有的并超过了第二年的水平。
    去年10月，五谷丰登的深秋季节，我们来到了龙江县，了解了全县的垦荒生产工作，并访问了开发祖国荒原的人们。
    晴朗的天空，没有一丝浮云，平坦而肥沃的土地，一望无际，新建起的屋舍组成的村庄，已同原有的村屯连成一片。田野间，到处散发着扑鼻的谷香。一队队满载庄稼的大车，在甸道上、公路上奔跑。这幅丰收的景象，几乎使我们忘记：在不到一年以前，这里还是一片野草丛生的荒原。
    我们来到了第四新村
    第四新村一百五十四名垦荒队员，种地三百三十二垧，可收粮九十五万八千多斤，菜十七万多斤，谷草三十多万斤；还有六千多元的副业收入。每人农副业纯收入平均可得三百元。有三十人能分到四百六十元。全村96％以上的人比在老家时增加了收入，增加一倍到一倍半的，占80％多些。
    新村办公室和垦荒者们的宿舍周围，鸦雀无声。我们穿过体育场，绕过能拴二、三百匹马的大马棚、家禽饲养场，走到集体食堂门口，这里有四个妇女正在忙着腌菜。
    “腌这多菜吃得完吗？”我指着一并排十几口大缸问。
    “小伙子们能吃呵！有些人的家属快要来了，腌这点菜哪够吃呀！”一个中年妇女指向约有二十公尺远的地方说：“那是三个大菜窖，萝卜、白菜、土豆子都窖满了。咱主任说：要叫大伙一年到头吃鲜菜。”
    她用白围裙擦擦手，从菜垛上拿起一个萝卜。“这个不算顶大个，可也有三斤重。同志，切开尝尝吧！”说完她把萝卜递给我。
    这时厨房的门开了。炊事员们正把笼里的大白馒头捡在笸箩里。一大锅香喷喷的菜——土豆、白菜加粉条，炖得咕嘟咕嘟地响。我们从他那里知道，他们每天一顿炖菜、一顿炒菜，不光吃豆油，还有猪油。哪个月都杀一口二百来斤重的大肥猪改善生活。
    垦荒者们能有这样的生活，是他们从艰苦斗争中得来的。但也是同国家的大力扶持和广大人民的热情支援分不开的。还在冰天雪地的季节里，县的党政领导机关便组织干部，为垦荒者们勘测土地，规划村址。当地群众自动借出九十多万块土坯，四千多公尺房基石，并自愿帮工给他们修盖房屋。国家投资、贷放一百七十四万余元，帮助他们购买牲口、大车和各种大、小型农具，以及种子、食粮、马料和服装等。所有这些，都为垦荒者们向荒地进军打下了良好的物质基础。
    “今天和过去，恰恰翻了个”
    第二生产队在地头上休息的时候，我们认识了已经四十六岁的垦荒队员孙善元。过去他在东北住过很久，那时是从山东逃荒来的，至今“北大荒”上还保存着他劳动过的痕迹。他经过几次申请，政府才批准他重新来到这块阔别多年的土地上。他对我们讲起了过去的情况。
    “过去，在山东有力无处使，春冬无柴烧。一家老小劳苦一年，结果吃不饱、穿不暖。没办法，只好背井离乡、千里迢迢另谋生路。好多人是挑挑担担来到‘关东’。到这里人地两生，举目无亲，还是得给地主扛活，受他们剥削，一年到头过着牛马不如的生活。”
    他又谈到了现在，意味深长地说：“今天和过去，恰恰翻了个。过去是逃荒、要饭；今天是为了社会主义。”
      什么困难都能克服
    妇女生产队长甄清芳，是去年春天和她爱人吴化田一起来到“北大荒”的。经过不到一年的辛勤劳动，他俩可以分到一万五千斤粮食，折款九百元。她在山东的时候，四口半人一年只能收两千多斤，年年都差两个半月的口粮。她对眼下的生活情况，已经很满意了。她说：“在这里干一年，顶在家忙好几年。咱来了以后，已经预分好几次了。你们看，”她指着炕上的新被，墙上挂的新大衣，身上穿的新绒衣和新棉袄、新棉裤，脚上穿的新回力球鞋，还有屋中摆设的家具，以及其他生活用品，高兴地说：“要是在老家，这些东西还得几年以后才能顾得上啊。”
    “你们在生产、生活上还有甚么困难吗？”我们问。
    “困难，那看怎么说啦。要是跟春天乍来时比，现在还有啥说的。”她滔滔不绝地给我们介绍了刚到“北大荒”时的情景。
    那正是春三月，草原尚未脱去冬装，地冻得蹦蹦硬，干起活来很不得手。少数房子还未盖完，有的人不得不暂时住在窝棚里。有的妇女天天跑到就近的老社去住。住对面炕、吃整粒的饭，很不习惯。大型新式农具，有些人从前见都没见过，更谈不到会用了。山东集镇多，群众哪个月都赶两趟集。“北大荒”一片草原，别说集呀，找个熟人串串门都得跑上一二十里。总之，吃的、穿的、使的、用的、听的、见的，处处都跟山东不一样。用甄清芳的话来说：“可别扭透了。”
    当我们问到他（她）们是怎样战胜这些困难的时候，她说：“不管遇到多大困难，只要想起咱是站在劳动生产的第一线，执行着祖国和人民交给咱的任务，就觉得身上有一股使不完的力气。到这里的第二天，大家就干起来了。……过了一关又一关，秋收这关最紧张。咱村今年地种的多，又丰收，人手不够。老天爷要提前下大雪，庄稼要叫雪给埋了，那还得了。可人总是有办法的，夜里借着月亮光干，咱村一百五十垧棒子 （玉米），都是夜里收的。”
    “那太辛苦了！”我们说：
    “辛苦？咱主任说的对呀！为了颗粒归家，一定得走在时间的前面。”她停了停又接着说：“大家甚么都习惯了，困难也都克服了。过去吃不惯整粒饭，现在苞米渣子、高粱米豆干饭，三天吃不着就想。但是，咱要在‘北大荒’建设社会主义，往后还会遇到困难，可咱不怕呀！”（附图片）
