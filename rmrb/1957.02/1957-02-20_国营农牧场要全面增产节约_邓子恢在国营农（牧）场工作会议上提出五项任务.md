The conference determined that this year's land reclamation task for state-owned farms and ranches nationwide will be expanded by about 20% compared to last year's actual reclaimed area, the sown area will increase by 4.5 million mu compared to last year, and the output of crops such as grain, soybeans, and cotton, and the number of pigs raised will be doubled compared to last year. The number of cattle, sheep, and horses will also increase compared to last year.

The conference demanded that all farms must implement the spirit of running farms diligently and thriftily, streamline and economize, reduce costs, resolutely overcome extravagance and waste, and reduce non-productive expenditures. The conference proposed that production team leaders of each farm should not be divorced from production, and that farm directors, deputy directors, and CCP Party secretaries should all participate in production and share weal and woe with agricultural (ranch) workers. Each farm should also properly arrange various productions according to primary and secondary importance, actively develop diversified operations, rationally allocate labor, increase the utilization rate of labor and land, and strive for a bumper harvest.

During the conference, Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui, Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, and Minister of Land Reclamation Wang Zhen all made reports to the conference. In his report, Deng Zihui proposed that the five tasks for state-owned farms and ranches in the future are: to expand farms and arable land area; to develop agricultural and animal husbandry production to supply the needs of the state, the people, and for export; to support cooperatives in all aspects; and to accumulate funds for national construction and cultivate management and technical personnel for large-scale production.

The conference also exchanged views on large-scale land reclamation in the Northwest, Northeast, and South China regions during the Second Five-Year Plan, as well as survey, planning, and design work for the reclamation of wasteland in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Bohai Bay area.
