This newspaper reports: The 270-plus townships in the Zhanjiang Special District of Guangdong Province that suffered from last year's late rice crop are actively carrying out a production self-rescue movement, striving to change the face of the disaster areas.

The agricultural cooperatives in these 270-plus disaster-stricken townships are generally arranging production and famine relief work household by household and cooperative by cooperative. Now, sideline production in the disaster area's agricultural cooperatives is very active, with generally 20% to 30% of the labor force投入into sideline production. The fifty-seven disaster-stricken townships in WuChuan and Dianbai counties are engaged in more than forty kinds of sideline occupations, with twenty-one thousand people participating in sideline production, and having an income of more than 160,000 yuan in just over two months.

In order to steadily overcome the spring famine, the agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas have generally expanded the area of winter planting. The winter crops in the forty-four disaster-stricken townships of Dianbai County have been expanded by 20%. The winter planting area in the four severely affected areas in the south of Maoming County is more than 380,000 mu, an expansion of more than 26,000 mu compared with last year. Many agricultural cooperatives have also strengthened field management of winter crops.

The disaster areas of Zhanjiang Special District are now striving to build water conservancy projects to improve water conservancy conditions. In the Jianjiang Plain, which has suffered from disasters for many years, more than 18,000 people are participating in the construction of the Jianxi flood control and drainage project. After the completion of this project, it can change the water conservancy conditions of more than 100,000 mu of disaster-stricken farmland in Wuchuan and Hua counties. In addition, mass activities to build small-scale farmland water conservancy have been widely carried out in the disaster areas.

Since the autumn harvest, the state has issued 1 million yuan in loans to the disaster-stricken areas to help the disaster-stricken cooperatives carry out shallow-sea fisheries production and agricultural and sideline production. In addition, 750,000 yuan has been issued for winter relief funds and 250,000 yuan for key disaster prevention construction subsidies.

    逐户安排生产努力战胜春荒
    本报讯　广东省湛江专区去年晚造受灾的二百七十多个乡，正在积极开展生产自救运动，争取改变灾区面貌。
    这二百七十多个灾乡的农业社，普遍逐社逐户安排生产度荒工作。现在灾区农业社的副业生产十分活跃，一般的都以20％到30％的劳动力投入副业生产。吴川、电白两个县的五十七个灾乡经营的副业有四十多种，参加副业生产的有二万一千人，两个多月已有十六万多元的收入。
    为了稳度春荒，灾区的农业社普遍扩大了冬种面积。电白县四十四个灾乡的冬种作物扩大了20％。茂名县南部四个重灾区的冬种面积有三十八万多亩，比去年扩大了二万六千多亩。许多农业社还加强了冬种作物的田间管理工作。
    湛江专区的灾区现在正在努力兴建水利工程，改善水利条件。连年受灾的鉴江平原，有一万八千多人参加修建鉴西防洪排灌工程。这个工程完成后，可以改变吴川、化县十多万亩受灾农田的水利条件。此外，灾区还普遍开展了群众性兴修小型农田水利的活动。
    秋收以来，国家已在受灾地区发了一百万元贷款，帮助受灾的合作社进行浅海渔业生产和农副业生产。另外，还发了冬令救济款七十五万元、重点防灾建设补助费二十五万元。
