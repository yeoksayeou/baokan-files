Discoveries on the Banks of the Salawusu River

The Cultural Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region dispatched cultural relics workers to the Salawusu River in Uxin Banner, Ik Zhao League, in April and October 1956 to investigate the Paleolithic cultural sites and made considerable gains.

The Salawusu River is located at the southern end of Uxin Banner in Ik Zhao League and is called Hongliu River in Chinese. The river is usually only a little over four meters wide and half a meter deep. However, the general river valley is fifty to sixty meters deep and more than five hundred meters wide. Ancient biological fossils and human cultural relics from ancient times, buried on both sides of the river, are often exposed by the river water. The western part of this river was archaeologically investigated by French priests Teilhard de Chardin and Emile Licent in 1924. They obtained many ancient biological fossils, some stone tools, and a fossilized human tooth. They called the people of that time "Ordos Man" and the culture of that time "Ordos Culture," which occupies an important position in archeology and history. However, from that time to the present, for more than thirty years, no Chinese archaeologists have gone to investigate.

The staff sent by the Inner Mongolia Cultural Bureau this time discovered human fossils, stone tools, and animal fossils in Dagouwan Village on the Salawusu River in the first district of Uxin Banner.

More than 70 pieces of Paleolithic tools and stone flakes were discovered in the original layer of Huangshagang in the west ditch of Dagouwan Village, along with fossils such as rhino skulls and horse teeth. The method of making the stone tools is different from the later microliths and may be tools used by humans in the Paleolithic Age.

There is one parietal bone fossil of a human being, found on the terrace of Dishao Gouwan Village, four kilometers west of Dagouwan Village, along with a fossilized cattle leg bone. Their surfaces are dark brown, the same color as the local ancient biological fossils, and they are quite petrified. There is also a section of femur, which was found on the dirt wall in front of a farmer's cave dwelling on the western terrace of the human parietal bone fossil discovery site. Its surface is also dark brown, heavier than a modern femur, and quite petrified.

The materials discovered this time are of great significance for scientific research. All the materials are currently being sorted out, and a preliminary draft of the excavation report will be published soon.　(Wang Yuping)

    萨拉乌苏河畔的发现
    内蒙古自治区文化局于1956年4月和10月两次派遣文物工作人员，前往伊克昭盟乌审旗萨拉乌苏河调查旧石器时代的文化遗址，获得不少收获。
    萨拉乌苏河在伊盟乌审旗的南端，汉语叫红柳河。河里的水，平常不过四公尺多宽，半公尺多深。一般河谷却有五、六十公尺深、五百多公尺宽。两岸埋藏的远古时期的古生物化石和人类文化遗物，常被河水冲露出来。这条河上的西部一带，早在1924年曾有法国神甫德日进、桑志华等人进行考古调查。他们曾得到许多古生物化石、一些石器和一颗人牙化石。他们把当时的人叫做“河套人”，把当时的文化叫做“河套文化”，在考古学和历史学上占着重要地位。但是从那时到现在，三十多年来一直没有中国的考古工作者前往调查。
    内蒙古文化局这次派去的工作人员在乌审旗一区萨拉乌苏河上的大沟湾村，又发现了人类化石、石器和兽类化石。
    在大沟湾村西沟的一处黄沙岗原生层中，发现旧石器和石片七十多件，与它同时出土的有犀牛头骨、马牙等化石。石器的打制的方法和后期细石器不同，可能是旧石器时代人类使用的工具。
    人类化石有顶骨化石一件，发现于大沟湾村西方四公里滴哨沟湾村的阶地上，与他同时同地出土的还有牛腿骨化石一件。它们的表面都呈暗褐色，与当地古生物化石颜色相同，并已相当石化。人类化石还有股骨一段，是在人顶骨化石出土地点的西方阶地上一家老乡的窑洞门前土墙上发现。它的表面也呈暗褐色，比现代股骨为重，也相当石化。
    这次发现的资料在科学研究上具有重要意义。全部资料现在整理中，不久即可发表发掘报告的初稿。　（汪宇平）
