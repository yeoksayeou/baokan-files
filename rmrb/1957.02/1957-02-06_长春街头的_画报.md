    The "Illustrated Newspaper" on the Streets of Changchun By our reporter, Wen Shuxian

    Winter in Changchun is a silver-white expanse, with ice everywhere. The temperature is often around minus twenty degrees Celsius. But a street-side open-air illustrated newspaper in Changchun is like a bonfire in the severe cold, attracting crowds of viewers day and night.

    This is the newly released issue number 58, and its content mainly opposes bureaucracy and dogmatism, and promotes the current international situation. Several young workers, pointing to a cartoon titled "Official Demeanor," laughed and said: "This trend is really unacceptable!" This cartoon depicts two cadres: one standing, warmly calling out to the other sitting at the table, "Old Liu." Old Liu ignores him, smoking a cigarette and glaring sideways. "Comrade Liu," the cadre changes his tone and calls out again, but Comrade Liu still ignores him, though the sideways glare becomes a little more direct. Finally, the cadre calls out "Section Chief Liu," and only then does this section chief raise his left hand behind him and say, "That's more like it!" The cartoon is naturally somewhat exaggerated, but the "official demeanor" it exposes is indeed still lingering in real life. Other viewers were saying as they looked, "Hey, that's a big hat!" They were looking at a cartoon titled "Criticize Bureaucracy to the End": a brave person repeatedly raises criticisms and suggestions to a bureaucratic leader, but this leader not only does not value his opinions and refuses his criticisms, but also uses big labels like "unorganized, undisciplined," and "resisting leadership" to cover him up. However, he breaks free from the hat and resolutely raises his opinions to the bureaucrat. Many other viewers stood in front of the current affairs cartoon section, reluctant to leave.

    This "illustrated newspaper" is run by the Changchun Municipal Culture Center (now being prepared as the Municipal Mass Art Center) and is a street gallery erected on Stalin Street, spanning 126 feet. It regularly meets the masses with brightly colored cartoons, comic strips, political propaganda posters, charts and more. Since April 1955, it has published more than 2,700 works.

    People greatly love this illustrated newspaper, calling it a "street university" and a "drummer promoting the central work of Changchun." At the beginning of last year, Changchun launched a high tide of socialist transformation. The "illustrated newspaper" quickly published "A Picture of Changchun Celebrating the Victory of Socialist Transformation," which attracted and inspired countless viewers. When news of the Anglo-French imperialist aggression against Egypt came, the "illustrated newspaper" immediately opened a news flash column, publishing news flashes every afternoon, reporting important news of the day in eye-catching fonts, and accompanied by current affairs cartoons, arousing the broad masses' indignation towards the aggressors, as well as their enthusiasm for supporting the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people. Everyone praised the "illustrated newspaper" for being quick and timely.

    Some of the paintings published in the "illustrated newspaper" are selected from "Cartoon" magazine and newspapers and periodicals from various places. Some are original creations by comrades in the Art Group of the Municipal Culture Center, and some are contributed by the masses. These paintings mostly take events related to the lives of the masses in Changchun as their subject matter, often expressing the advanced workers with the greatest enthusiasm and criticizing the backward phenomena in life. The "illustrated newspaper" once published a set of comic strips praising the youth sales team of the Changchun State-owned Canteen. A relatively backward waiter in this team, after seeing this set of comic strips, realized his erroneous idea that being a waiter was not a "promising" job, and then he became active and proactive in his work. When Changchun launched a hygiene campaign last year, the cartoons in the "illustrated newspaper" severely criticized those who did not pay attention to hygiene. Two of them were particularly impressive: one criticized the family dormitory of the Jilin Provincial People's Committee and the Second Store of the Department Store, because they secretly dumped garbage in the alley. Many people who saw this cartoon said, "It's really energetic! Even the dormitory of the Provincial People's Committee is being criticized, how can we not do a good job in hygiene?" Another one was titled "White-Clad Heavenly Maid Scattering Flowers": In the magnificent Changchun Municipal Hospital building, a female comrade wearing white work clothes dumped garbage from a fourth-floor window onto the street, accidentally scattering it on several passers-by. The "building" in the picture was exactly the same as the real Changchun Municipal Hospital building, and the hospital was exactly across the street from the "illustrated newspaper." Since then, people have never seen a similar incident happen in this hospital again. A few months ago, the "illustrated newspaper" published a comic strip criticizing two factories for neglecting safe production and causing personal accidents. After seeing this, the director of the Changchun Machinery Factory No. 1, which was criticized, held a staff meeting, made a self-criticism, and took effective measures to eliminate accidents.

    Because this "illustrated newspaper" is militant and can use the weapon of criticism to speak for the masses, the masses greatly love it. Some masses, who cannot paint themselves, also write to the Art Group about the bad phenomena they have seen, requesting that they be drawn and published. Some masses try to submit paintings to the "illustrated newspaper." For example, the cartoon "Official Demeanor" and "White-Clad Heavenly Maid Scattering Flowers" introduced earlier were creations of the masses.

    The comrades of the Art Group of the Municipal Culture Center did not have much confidence when they started doing this street illustrated newspaper, and they even thought that this work was not "promising." But the Party cares about them very much, and the masses are increasingly welcoming their work.

    One afternoon in the spring of the year before last, the Propaganda Department of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China asked them to talk. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department encouraged them to learn from the famous Soviet satirical poet Mayakovsky, to make the "illustrated newspaper" as militant as the "ROSTA Windows," to play a fighting role, to be used as a weapon for educating the masses, and as the eyes to supervise the city's work.

    This conversation made them realize that it was only they themselves who looked down on the work of the street illustrated newspaper. The Party and the masses care about them. They realized the important significance of this work, and thus loved their work even more.

### 长春街头的“画报”

    长春街头的“画报”	本报记者　温述仙
    冬天的长春市，一片银白色，到处是冰冻。气温经常在零下二十度左右。但是长春一个露天的街头画报，却好像严寒中的篝火，一天到晚吸引着大批大批的观众。
    这是新出的第五十八期“画报”，内容主要是反对官僚主义、教条主义；宣传当前的国际形势。几个年轻的工人，指着一幅题为“官风”的漫画笑道：“这股风真要不得！”这幅漫画画着两个干部：站着的一人，亲热地向坐在桌旁的另一人叫道：“老刘”，老刘没有理睬，抽着香烟，斜瞪着眼珠。“刘同志”，这个干部改换口气，再叫一声，但刘同志仍然不理睬，不过斜瞪着的眼珠转正了一些。最后，干部又叫了一声“刘股长”，这位股长才把左手往后面一扬，说道：“这才像个样子！”漫画自然有些夸张，不过它所揭露出来的这种“官风”，在现实生活中，确实还遗留着。另外有些观众在那儿边看边说：“嘿，这顶帽子真大！”原来他们正在看一幅题为“向官僚主义批评到底”的漫画：一个勇敢的人，三番五次地向官僚主义的领导者提出批评和建议，但是这位领导人员不仅不重视他的意见，拒绝他的批评，并且用“无组织、无纪律”、“反抗领导”等等大帽子把他罩起来，然而，他从帽顶上冲出来，又向官僚主义者坚决地提出了意见。还有许多观众，站在时事漫画栏前面，舍不得走开。
    这个“画报”是长春市文化馆（现在改为市群众艺术馆筹备处）办的，是竖立在斯大林大街的街头画廊，长达一百二十六尺。它经常以色彩鲜明的漫画、连环画、政治宣传画以及图表等等，和群众见面。从1955年4月以来，共刊出了二千七百多幅。
    人们非常喜爱这个画报，称它为“街头大学”、“推动长春市中心工作的鼓手”。去年年初，长春掀起了社会主义改造的高潮，“画报”很快刊出了“长春市庆祝社会主义改造胜利图”，吸引和鼓舞了无数的观众。当英法帝国主义者侵略埃及的消息传来以后，“画报”马上开辟了快报栏，每天下午刊出快报，用醒目的字体，报道当天重要的消息，并配上时事漫画，激起了广大人民对于侵略者的义愤，以及支援埃及人民英勇斗争的热情。大家都称赞“画报”出得迅速及时。
    “画报”刊登的画，有一部分选自“漫画”杂志和各地报刊，一部分是市文化馆美术组同志自己创作的，还有一些是群众投稿。这些画多以长春市群众生活有关的事件为题材，常常以最大的热情，表扬先进工作者和批评生活中的落后现象。“画报”曾经刊登过一套连环画，表扬长春国营食堂的青年推销组，这个组里有一个比较落后的服务员，看到这套连环画以后，认识到自己以为服务员工作没“出息”的错误思想，于是工作积极主动起来。去年长春市开展卫生运动的时候，“画报”上的漫画，严厉地批评了不讲卫生的人，给人们印象较深的有这样两幅：其一批评吉林省人民委员会家属宿舍和百货公司第二商店，因为他们偷偷地把垃圾倒在胡同里。许多人看了这幅漫画都说：“真带劲！连省人民委员会的宿舍都批评上了，我们还能不搞好卫生吗？”另外一幅题为“白衣天女散花”：在雄伟的长春市立医院大楼里，一个穿着白工作服的女同志，从四楼窗口往街上倒垃圾，恰巧撒在几个过路人的身上。画上的“大楼”和真的市立医院大楼一模一样，而且医院同“画报”恰恰隔街相对。从此，人们便再也没有看到这个医院发生类似的事件了。前几个月，“画报”刊登了批评两个工厂忽视安全生产、发生人身事故的连环画。被批评的长春机械一厂厂长看到以后，召开了职工大会，作了自我检讨，并采取了消灭事故的有效措施。
    由于这个“画报”具有战斗性，能够运用批评的武器，代表群众说话，群众非常喜爱它。有些群众，自己不会绘画，也把看到的不良现象，写给美术组，请求绘画刊出。有些群众则尝试着以画稿投寄“画报”，例如前面介绍的漫画“官风”和“白衣天女散花”就是群众的创作。
    市文化馆美术组的同志们，在开始搞这个街头画报的时候，信心不大，还认为这个工作没有“出息”。但是党非常关心他们，群众对他们的工作也越来越欢迎了。
    前年春天的一个下午，中共吉林省委宣传部找他们去谈话，省委宣传部的负责同志鼓励他们，要他们向苏联著名的讽刺诗人马雅可夫斯基学习，把“画报”办得像“罗斯塔之窗”一样，发挥战斗性，作为教育群众的武器，作为监督全市工作的眼睛。
    这次谈话，使他们认识到，看不起街头画报工作的不过是他们自己，党和群众是关怀他们的，他们认识到这一工作的重要意义，从而更热爱自己的工作。
