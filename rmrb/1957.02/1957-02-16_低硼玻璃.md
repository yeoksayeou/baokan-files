    Low-Boron Glass
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The local state-owned Wuhan Glass Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a type of low-boron glass. Repeated tests within the factory and at relevant pharmaceutical factories have proven that this glass possesses the same acid and alkali resistance as the borosilicate glass currently produced by various glass factories in China. It can replace borosilicate glass in the manufacture of medicine bottles for injection solutions. However, the amount of borosilicate used to manufacture this glass is 77.5% less than that of borosilicate glass. Therefore, at a time when China is currently lacking borax, it plays a significant role in ensuring the production of injections at pharmaceutical factories.
    Currently, low-boron glass is undergoing mass production. The raw material cost for producing this glass is 5.6% lower than that of ordinary borosilicate glass.

    低硼玻璃
    据新华社讯　地方国营武汉玻璃厂最近试制成功一种低硼玻璃。经过厂内和有关药厂的反复试验证明，这种玻璃有同现在我国各玻璃厂通常生产的硼硅玻璃一样的抗酸抗咸性能，它能代替硼硅玻璃制造装注射剂溶液用的药瓶。但是制造这种玻璃的硼硅用量，要比硼硅玻璃少77.5％。因此，在我国目前缺少硼砂的时候，它对保证药厂针剂生产有很大的作用。
    现在，低硼玻璃正在进行成批生产。生产这种玻璃的原料成本比一般硼硅玻璃要低5.6％。
