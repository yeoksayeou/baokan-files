The sound of gongs and drums, firecrackers, laughter, and the brisk military music and applause rise and fall in succession. The streets and alleys are filled with joy. Naturally, the Spring Festival is always lively and joyous, but this year's Hekou is different from previous years, and different from other places. The residents are particularly interested in this year's Spring Festival. In addition to pasting bright red Spring Festival couplets on their doors, they also put up strings of exquisite colored paper-cuts. Small and exquisite colored arches were erected at the gates of government offices and enterprises. More than a dozen memorial arches were also built in the streets, decorated with lanterns and colored paper-cuts. On the memorial arch at the head of the China-Vietnam Bridge, the national flags of China and Vietnam are flying, and portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and President Ho Chi Minh stand side by side. This is because the border residents of Hekou County and the border residents of Lao Cai Province in Vietnam will hold a Spring Festival get-together here.

The people of Hekou are hospitable. They have long been talking about how to receive our close neighbors, the Vietnamese friends. Those who have relatives in Vietnam are busy preparing to entertain them; those who do not have relatives in Vietnam are equally enthusiastic. Resident Qin Hemei said: When people from Lao Cai come, whether they are relatives or not, we must treat them as well as possible. Many comrades from government offices, enterprises, and handicraft cooperatives went to the mountains several miles away to find ferns to build arches.

The residents of Hekou, who have developed good hygiene habits over the years, have cleaned up particularly well this time, and some have even arranged early-blooming peach blossoms in their windows. The lion dance, which has not been performed for several years, is being rehearsed again. Members of various ethnic groups in the blacksmith and carpenter handicraft production cooperative are earnestly practicing singing and dancing, and they want to dedicate their traditional ethnic programs to the get-together. Many overseas Vietnamese, who originally wanted to go back to celebrate the festival, are now acting as hosts, busy preparing to receive their relatives. In order to show their enthusiasm for their compatriots, the overseas Vietnamese also volunteered to build a large archway on the road leading to the assembly square.

The news spread quickly to the countryside, and the farmers in the countryside were even more enthusiastic. The Xiaobazi area, located in the northeast corner, was told to send fewer people because the transportation was too inconvenient. Many Miao farmers said: Such a major event has never happened before, we must go. If transportation is inconvenient, we can ride livestock and bring dry food.

In order to ensure the food and drink of the border residents participating in the get-together, several more supply points have been added to the street and have already started supplying. Staple foods such as rice, flour, and noodles, as well as various daily necessities, have been transported in large quantities.

Literary and art troupes and sports teams from Kunming, Honghe, Mengzi, and Kaiyuan have also arrived one after another. The Vietnam Democratic Republic Photo Exhibition Hall has been roughly arranged. The guesthouse has long been cleaned up and is waiting for the Lao Cai delegation to stay.

At night, Hekou is no longer as boiling as during the day. Looking from the small hill, the front is a sea of lights like stars. Only the particularly bright lights of the archway at the head of the China-Vietnam Bridge make it clear where Hekou is and where Lao Cai is; at the same time, these particularly bright lights also make people think more clearly of China and Vietnam, and of the brotherly relationship between China and Vietnam.

### 新春佳节候亲人

    新春佳节候亲人	章皆淳
    锣鼓声，爆竹声，欢笑声，还有轻快的军乐声和拍掌声此起彼落地响着，大街小巷到处喜气洋洋。自然，春节总是热闹的、欢乐的；但今年的河口却和往年不同，和别处也不同。居民们对今年的春节特别感到兴趣，他们除了在门口贴上鲜红的春联外，还拉上一串串精巧的彩色剪纸。机关、企业的大门口扎上了小巧的彩门。街上也搭起了十多个牌坊，上面装饰着花灯和彩色剪纸。在中越大桥桥头上的那个牌坊上面，飘扬着中越两国的国旗，并立着毛泽东主席和胡志明主席的画像。这都是因为我们河口县的边民和越南老街省的边民将在这里举行春节联欢大会。
    河口的人民是好客的。他们早就相互谈论着怎样接待我们亲密的邻居——越南朋友。有亲戚在越南的，忙着准备款待亲戚；没有亲戚在越南的，也是同样热心。居民秦和妹说：老街人过来，不管是亲戚不是亲戚，都要尽可能好地招待他。许多机关、企业和手工业合作社的同志，跑到几里远的山上找了蕨蕨草来扎牌坊。
    几年来已经养成良好的卫生习惯的河口居民，这次收拾得特别整洁，有的还在窗口布置上初放的桃花。几年没有耍的狮子舞，又在重新排练了。铁匠、木匠手工业生产合作社中的各族社员，认真地练习着歌舞，他们要把本民族的传统节目献给联欢大会。有不少越侨，本想回去过节的，现在也反客为主，在忙着准备接待亲人。越侨为了表示对他们同胞的热情，还自告奋勇在通向大会广场的路上搭了一座大牌坊。
    消息很快地传到乡里，乡里的农民更是热心。处在东北角的小坝子区，因交通太不方便，区里叫他们少来些人。许多苗族农民都说：这样的大事哪里有过，我们一定要去。交通不便，我们可以骑牲口带上干粮。
    为了保证参加联欢的边民的饮食，街上添设了好多个供应点，并已开始供应。大米、面粉、挂面等主食和各种日用百货已大量运到。
    昆明、红河、蒙自、开远等地的文艺队伍和球队也都先后到达。越南民主共和国图片展览馆，已经大致布置就绪。迎宾馆则早已收拾停当，就等着老街的代表团来住了。
    入夜，河口不再像白天一样的沸腾了。在小山包上望去，前面是繁星一样的一片灯光，只有中越大桥桥头上那牌坊的特别明亮的灯光，才使人清楚地分出哪是河口，哪是老街；同时，这特别明亮的灯光也使人更清楚地想起中国和越南，想起中越两国亲兄弟一样的关系。
