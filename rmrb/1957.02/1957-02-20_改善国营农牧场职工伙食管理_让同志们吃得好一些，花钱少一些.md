Improving the Food Management of State-Owned Farms and Ranches
——Let Comrades Eat Better and Spend Less
Zhang Linchi, Vice Minister of Agricultural Reclamation

Over the past few years, state-owned agricultural and pastoral enterprises have accumulated a lot of experience. The unit area yield of various crops and livestock products has been increasing year by year, and most of the production costs have been decreasing year by year. However, our management level is still very low, and there are still many shortcomings and errors. One of the problems that cannot be ignored is that we have not fully relied on the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and staff, so that the lives of the workers and staff have not been improved as they should have been under diligence and thrift.

A major problem in the lives of workers and staff in state-owned farms today is that the food costs of many farm workers and staff are too high. For example, the average monthly salary of workers and staff in state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province is about 40 yuan, and the canteen food cost is 18 to 20 yuan per person per month; the average monthly salary of workers and staff in state-owned farms (reclamation farms) in Guangdong Province is 35 to 43 yuan, and the canteen food cost is 12 to 16 yuan per person per month; the food costs of workers and staff in many other state-owned farms are almost one-third or even more than half of their wages.

Are food costs so high because people are eating well? No, they are not eating well. Many farm workers and staff cannot get enough fresh vegetables, and cannot eat meat for days or even dozens of days. Many canteens do not pay attention to economy or nutrition, nor do they pay attention to taste. Sometimes the workers and staff have to eat cold rice and cold dishes.

Since the food is not good, why spend so much money? It turns out that the grains, vegetables, meat, oil, etc. eaten in many farm canteens are bought from outside or even from very far away. All the grain produced by state-owned farms is sold to the state, while the grain eaten by workers and staff has to be supplied by the grain department. The coarse grains that originally cost five or six cents a pound are transported back and forth to be exchanged for rice and white flour costing ten cents to eighteen cents a pound. For example, in the Friendship Farm canteen, each steamed bun sells for five cents. Each person eats three meals a day, eight steamed buns. Staple foods alone cost about twelve yuan per month. Many farms sell live pigs and then buy pork back from the market at a price one or two times higher to eat. In addition, vegetables, oil, salt, sauce, and firewood (coal) all have to be purchased from outside, so the food cost is naturally high.

This problem has not aroused widespread attention from the leading cadres of state-owned farms. Some leading comrades of state-owned farms believe that the production tasks are busy and they have no time to take care of personal life trivia such as eating and clothing, and they put the completion of production tasks in opposition to improving the lives of workers and staff. Some farm leading cadres never go to the staff canteen to see, or even if they do, they do not solve specific problems. This bureaucratic style must be seriously overcome. Facts have proved that if the leading cadres follow the mass line, they can use the favorable conditions of the farm to reduce food costs, so that the workers and staff can eat well and save food. For example, Datong Lake Farm in Hunan Province grows its own vegetables and raises pigs, and the monthly food cost per person has been reduced from ten yuan to seven or eight yuan; the food cost of workers and staff in Jixian Farm in Heilongjiang Province has also been reduced by 30%.

Building farms through diligence and thrift, increasing production, practicing economy, and caring for the lives of workers and staff are the responsibilities of every farm leader. The leaders of every farm and ranch should conscientiously implement the policy of gradually improving the lives of workers and staff on the basis of developing production. Here are just a few important issues and some solutions.

I. Each farm should allocate a small plot of land near the canteen for the canteen to grow vegetables. The amount of land should be determined according to the number of people eating and the yield of vegetables. The leading comrades of the farm should help the canteen managers and lead the workers and staff to grow, preserve, and adjust the vegetables well, so as to achieve high yields and low costs. Every food unit should raise pigs and chickens, and those with ponds can also raise fish and ducks. On average, the staff canteen should gradually raise one pig for every ten people. In addition to feeding the pig swill, leftovers, and vegetables, the farm should also sell feed for raising pigs to the canteen at a price slightly higher than the cost, and purchase pig manure as fertilizer. In this way, workers and staff can eat cheap and fresh vegetables and meat.

II. We have reached an agreement with the grain department that, in addition to selling the grain produced by the farm to the state according to the plan, we can keep the grain for our own consumption and other uses, and we can process it ourselves. In this way, farm workers and staff can eat cheap grains that are suitable for the tastes of most local people. In some areas, farms produce too few types of grain, so they can also ask the grain department to appropriately adjust the grain seeds.

III. Reduce fuel costs. Many farm canteens burn an average of more than one catty of coal per person per day, but some canteens only need half a catty of coal. We should earnestly study various experiences in saving coal. Many farms do not burn coal at all. They use stalks that cannot be fed to livestock or easily used as fertilizer as firewood. This is also a way to save fuel costs.

IV. We must strengthen the ideological education of cooks and managers, improve their understanding and enthusiasm for food work, and on this basis, launch a socialist labor competition to exchange advanced experiences in making good meals and good dishes. A food management committee should be established by the workers and staff who eat in the canteen to be responsible for managing the food.

V. While improving the food of farm workers and staff, we must also plan to move the families of workers and staff to the farm in batches. After the families move in, in addition to solving the housing problem for the families of workers and staff, they should also be given small plots of land to grow their own vegetables, and they should be encouraged to engage in sideline production such as raising pigs and chickens. Those family members who are suitable for long-term labor should be given priority to be admitted to the farm. Seasonal labor on the farm should be absorbed by family members as much as possible, which will not only increase their income but also solve the problem of temporary workers on the farm.

On the premise of saving state expenditures and reducing production costs, reducing the food costs of workers and staff so that everyone can eat better and spend less will play a major positive role in inspiring the labor enthusiasm and creativity of workers and staff and striving to overfulfill production tasks.

    改善国营农牧场职工伙食管理
    ——让同志们吃得好一些，花钱少一些
    农垦部副部长　张林池
    几年来，国营农牧企业积累了不少的经验，各种作物的单位面积产量和畜产品均在逐年提高，大多数的生产成本也逐年降低。但是，我们的经营管理水平还很低，还有很多缺点和错误。其中一个不可忽视的问题，就是没有充分地依靠职工群众的积极性和创造性，使职工生活在克勤克俭之下得到应有的改善。
    当前国营农场职工生活中的一个主要问题是，很多农场职工的伙食费太高。如黑龙江省国营农场职工的工资平均每月四十元左右，食堂的伙食费每人每月就需要十八至二十元；广东省国营农场（垦殖场）职工的工资平均每月三十五至四十三元，食堂的伙食费每人每月就要十二至十六元；其他地区许多国营农场职工的伙食费也几乎都要占工资的三分之一，甚至一半以上。
    伙食费这样高，是不是吃得很好呢？不，吃得并不好。许多农场的职工不能吃到充足的新鲜蔬菜，几天甚至几十天也吃不到肉。许多食堂既不注意经济、营养，也不注意口味，有时职工们还不得不吃冷饭冷菜。
    吃的既然不好，为什么要花那么多的钱呢？原来很多农场食堂里吃的粮食、菜、肉、油等都是从外边甚至很远的地方买来的。国营农场生产的粮食全部交售给国家，而职工们吃的粮食却要由粮食部门供应。本来五、六分钱一斤的粗粮，运来运去却换来了一角到一角八分一斤的大米、白面。如友谊农场职工食堂每个馒头卖五分钱，每人每天吃三顿饭八个馒头，仅主食每月就要十二元左右。很多农场把生猪卖出去，再用高一、二倍的价钱从市场上把猪肉买回来吃，再加上蔬菜、油、盐、酱、烧柴（煤）等都要从外边购买，伙食费自然就高了。
    这个问题并没有引起国营农场领导干部的普遍重视。某些国营农场的领导同志认为生产任务繁忙，无暇顾及吃饭、穿衣等个人生活上的琐事，而把完成生产任务和改善职工生活对立起来。有的农场领导干部，从来不去职工食堂看看，或是去看了也不给解决具体问题。这种官僚主义作风必须认真加以克服。事实证明，领导干部走了群众路线，就能利用农场的有利条件，把伙食费用降低，使职工吃的既好，还节省了粮食。如湖南大通湖农场自己种菜养猪，每人每月的伙食费用从十元降到七、八元；黑龙江集贤农场职工的伙食费用也因此降低了30％。
    勤俭建场、增加生产厉行节约和关心职工生活是每一个农场领导人员应负的责任。每个农牧场的领导人员都应该认真地贯彻执行在发展生产的基础上逐步改善职工生活的方针。这里仅就几个比较重要的问题提出一些解决的办法。
    一、每个农场都应当在食堂附近划出小块土地给食堂种菜，土地的多少应按吃饭的人数和蔬菜的产量来定。农场的领导同志应当帮助食堂的管理人员并率领职工把菜种好，保存好、调剂好，作到产量高、成本低。每一个伙食单位都应该养猪、养鸡，有水塘的还可以养鱼养鸭，应该逐步作到职工食堂平均每十个人养一口猪。猪食除喂洗锅泔水、剩饭菜外，农场还应按稍高于成本的价钱卖给食堂养猪的饲料，并收购猪粪作肥料。这样，就可以使职工吃到便宜的新鲜蔬菜和肉食。
    二、我们已经和粮食部门商妥，农场生产的粮食除按计划交售给国家外，可以留下自己吃的及其他用途的粮食，并可自行加工。这样，农场职工就能够吃到价钱便宜而又适合多数当地人口味的粮食了。有些地区的农场生产粮食的种类太少，还可以请粮食部门适当地调剂粮种。
    三、降低燃料费。许多农场食堂每人每天平均要烧一斤多煤，但有些食堂半斤煤就够了，应该认真学习各种节省烧煤的经验。也有许多农场根本不烧煤炭，他们利用既不能喂牲口又不易作肥料的秸秆作烧柴，这也是节约燃料费的一种方法。
    四、必须加强对炊事员和管理人员的思想教育，提高他们对伙食工作的认识与积极性，并在此基础上展开社会主义劳动竞赛，交流做好饭、好菜的先进经验。由在食堂吃饭的职工选举成立伙食管理委员会，负责管理伙食。
    五、在改善农场职工伙食的同时，还必须有计划的分期分批的把职工的家属搬到农场来。家属搬来以后，除必须解决职工家属的住房问题外，还应给予家属小块土地，让他们自己种菜，提倡家属从事养猪、养鸡等副业生产。家属中有适合长期劳动的应尽先吸收入场，场内季节性的劳动应尽量吸收家属去做，既增加其收入，又解决农场的临时工的问题。
    在节约国家开支和降低生产成本的前提下，降低职工的伙食费用，让大家吃得好一些，花钱少一些。这对启发职工们的劳动积极性和创造性，争取超额完成生产任务，将会起重大的积极作用。
