Xinhua News Agency, February 13th: According to a TASS report on February 12th: The Soviet government, on February 11th, delivered identical notes to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.

    In the note, the Soviet government proposed that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France formulate and announce basic principles regarding peace and security in the Middle East and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in this region. These principles could serve as the basis for a joint declaration. Such a joint declaration would make it impossible for any major power to take dangerous unilateral actions against Middle Eastern countries and would promote peace and security in this vital region, as well as the development of national economies and the consolidation of independence of these countries.

    The Soviet government's notes were delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov to US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlen, French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Dejean, and British Chargé d'affaires to the Soviet Union Parrott, respectively.

    The note stated that, thanks to the efforts of peace-loving people and the support of the United Nations, the aggression against Egypt was stopped, and a favorable situation has emerged, creating a real possibility for guaranteeing peace and resolving international issues in the Middle East.

    However, regrettably, the period of easing tensions in the region was short-lived. Due to the unilateral actions of certain countries, the situation in the Middle East has recently deteriorated severely again. This is primarily because of attempts to unilaterally use the armed forces of a major power stationed in the Middle East to arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of the region without the consent of the United Nations. Others want to provide so-called economic assistance to Middle Eastern countries, but the conditions attached are that these countries must not have any contact with certain member states of the United Nations. This means that to obtain "assistance," they must accept political conditions that are incompatible with their dignity, sovereignty, and the lofty principles of the United Nations.

    The note continued, "It cannot be ignored that the implementation of such policies that disregard the United Nations will further exacerbate the situation in the region and threaten the cause of peace throughout the world."

    This plan is nothing more than a continuation of the policy of establishing exclusive military-aggressive blocs like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact.

    The note stated that the foundation of Soviet foreign policy is the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries, regardless of their social and state systems. When establishing friendly relations with Arab countries, the Soviet Union has not only never sought to worsen the relations between these countries and other major powers, but on the contrary, the Soviet Union advocates broad international cooperation, the guarantee of lasting peace, and the establishment of an atmosphere of trust in the Middle East region. The Soviet Union's own interests require maintaining peace in the Middle East region, which is directly adjacent to its borders. It sincerely hopes that the countries in this region will consolidate their national independence and achieve economic prosperity.

    According to the Soviet government, maintaining peace in the Middle East is not only a necessary condition for the development of Middle Eastern countries but also a necessary condition for ensuring the economic stability of many other countries. The Soviet government believes that the joint efforts of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, can guarantee lasting and solid peace in this region, as long as the relations between these countries and Middle Eastern countries are based on the common principles of non-interference in internal affairs and respect for national independence and sovereignty.

    The note then discussed the basic principles of the joint declaration proposed by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and stated that the declaration welcomes the participation of any country concerned with peace and security. The proposals regarding the relevant obligations of the signatory countries can be immediately notified to the governments and peoples of the Middle Eastern countries.

    The note concluded with a draft of the basic principles of the declaration by the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on peace and security in the Middle East and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in this region.

    The draft states:

    "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the French Republic,

    Following the lofty peace-loving aims and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,

    Declare their agreement that the desire to establish peace and security in the Middle East and the world shall be the basis of their policies towards Middle Eastern countries;

    Recognizing and respecting the lofty principles of relations between countries as set forth in the Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries;

    Striving to create favorable conditions for the national independence and national sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries;

    Sincerely hoping to promote the economic prosperity of countries in this region selflessly through joint efforts, and at the same time, believing that the natural resources of underdeveloped countries are the inalienable national wealth of the peoples of these countries, therefore, they have the full right to independently and autonomously control and utilize them for the development of their national economy and progress.

    The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France

    Are willing to promote the comprehensive development of economic, trade, and cultural relations between Middle Eastern countries and all countries based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

    Believing that the extensive economic and trade ties between the countries of this region are not only in the interests of these countries but also in the interests of ensuring the economic prosperity of other countries in the world,

    Believing that all international issues and disputes concerning the Middle East must be resolved peacefully through negotiation.

    The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, aware of their important responsibilities for maintaining world peace and security, guarantee to abide by the following principles in their policies towards the Middle East:

    1. To maintain peace in the Middle East by resolving disputes only by peaceful means on the basis of negotiation.

    2. Non-interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries; respect for the sovereignty and independence of these countries.

    3. No attempts to drag these countries into military blocs with major powers participating.

    4. Withdrawal of foreign bases and foreign troops from the territories of Middle Eastern countries.

    5. Joint refusal to supply weapons to Middle Eastern countries.

    6. Promoting the economic development of Middle Eastern countries without attaching any political, military, or other conditions incompatible with the dignity and sovereignty of these countries.

    The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France express their hope that other countries will also abide by these principles in their relations with Middle Eastern countries."

    苏联提出不干涉中近东国家内政的基本原则
    照会美英法政府建议发表联合宣言
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社12日报道：苏联政府在2月11日以内容相同的照会递交给美、英、法三国政府。
    苏联政府在照会中建议由苏联、美国、英国和法国政府制定和宣布关于中近东和平和安全以及不干涉这一地区各国内政的基本原则。这些原则可以作为联合宣言的基础，通过这样一个联合宣言就会使任何大国没有可能对中近东国家采取危险的片面行动，将会促进这一十分重要的地区的和平和安全，促进这些国家民族经济的发展和独立的巩固。
    苏联政府的照会是由苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫分别交给美国驻苏联大使波伦、法国驻苏联大使德让和英国驻苏联临时代办帕罗特的。
    照会说，由于爱好和平的人民的努力和联合国的支持，侵略埃及的行动被制止了，良好的局面已经形成，保障和平和解决中近东地区的国际问题已经有了真正的可能。
    但是，遗憾的是，这个地区紧张局势趋于缓和的时期并不长久。由于某些国家的片面行动，中近东的局势最近又严重地恶化了。这首先是因为有人企图不经联合国的同意单方面地利用一个大国驻在中近东的武装部队任意干涉这个地区的内政。还有人想向中近东国家提供所谓经济援助，而强迫这些国家接受的条件是：这些国家不得同联合国某些会员国发生任何联系，这就是说，要想得到“援助”就得接受同它们的尊严和主权以及同联合国的崇高原则绝不相容的政治条件。
    照会接着说，不能不看到，实行这种把联合国撇开一边的政策，将会使这个地区的局势再次紧张起来，并且将使全世界的和平事业受到威胁。
    这种计划无非是建立北大西洋公约组织、东南亚公约组织和巴格达条约这一类排它性军事侵略集团的政策的继续。
    照会说，苏联外交政策的基础是各国（不问它们社会和国家制度如何）和平共处的原则。苏联在和阿拉伯国家建立友好关系的时候，不仅从来没有要使这些国家同其他大国的关系变坏，恰恰相反，苏联主张广泛的国际合作，主张保障持久和平，以及在中近东地区建立信任的气氛。苏联的切身利益要求同它的边境直接相邻的中近东地区保持和平。它衷心地希望这个地区的国家巩固民族独立并获得经济的繁荣。
    据苏联政府看来，保持中近东地区的和平不仅是中近东各国发展的必要条件，而且也是保证其他许多国家经济稳定的必要条件。苏联政府认为，苏联、美国、英国和法国这几个作为联合国安全理事会常任理事国的大国共同努力，就能够保证这个地区的持久而巩固的和平，只要这些国家同中近东各国的关系都以不干涉内政和尊重民族独立和主权的共同原则为基础。
    照会接着谈到了苏联建议由苏、美、英、法四国制定和宣布的联合宣言的基本原则，并且声称这个宣言欢迎关心和平和安全的任何一个国家参加，关于宣言签字国有关义务的建议可以立即通知中近东各国政府和人民。
    照会最后附上了苏、美、英、法四国政府关于中近东和平和安全以及不干涉这个地区国家内政问题的宣言的基本原则草案。
    这个草案说：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、美利坚合众国、联合王国和法兰西共和国，
    遵循联合国宪章所阐述的崇高的爱好和平的宗旨和原则，
    声明同意，以建立中近东和全世界和平和安全的愿望作为它们对中近东国家的政策的基础；
    承认和尊重亚非国家万隆会议所定出的国与国之间关系的崇高原则；
    努力创造中近东国家民族独立和国家主权的有利条件；
    真诚希望通过共同努力无私地促进这个地区国家的经济繁荣，同时并认为，不发达国家的自然资源是这些国家人民不可剥夺的民族财富，因此，他们有充分的权利为了发展自己的民族经济和进步而独立自主地支配和利用它们。
    苏联、美国、英国和法国政府
    愿意根据平等互利原则促进中近东国家和一切国家的经济、贸易和文化关系的全面发展。
    认为，这个地区各国广泛的经济和贸易联系，不仅符合这些国家的利益，而且符合保证世界其他各国经济繁荣的利益，
    认为必须用谈判方式和平解决一切国际问题和有关中近东的争执问题。
    苏联、美国、英国、和法国四国政府意识到它们对维护世界和平和安全所负的重大责任，保证在自己对中近东的政策中遵行下述原则：
    一、在谈判方式基础上只用和平方法解决争执问题，以维护中近东和平。
    二、不干涉中近东国家内政；尊重这些国家的主权和独立。
    三、不企图把这些国家拖入有大国参加的军事集团。
    四、撤消中近东领土上的外国基地并撤退外国军队。
    五、共同拒绝把武器供给中近东国家。
    六、促进中近东国家经济发展而不附带提出同这些国家尊严和主权不相容的任何政治、军事或其他条件。
    苏联、美国、联合王国和法国政府表示希望，其他国家在同中近东国家的关系中也将遵行这些原则。”
