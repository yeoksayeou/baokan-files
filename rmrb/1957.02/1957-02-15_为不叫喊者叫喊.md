    Crying Out for Those Who Don't Cry Out
    Gong Changjing
    Recently, I often see voices in the newspaper from those who are "bored out of their minds." Someone full of enthusiasm, wanting to diligently do some work for the revolution, finds that there is almost no work to do. Firstly, they feel they have no place to use their talents and are not getting the training they should; secondly, they feel guilty for just eating and receiving a salary without contributing to the revolution; hence, they "panic," become dissatisfied, offer opinions, create trouble, complain, and report to higher authorities. This is easy to understand and extremely sympathetic.

    It is said that some leaders are very afraid of cadres below shouting "bored out of their minds," saying that it is not that there is no work to do, but that they have not actively developed their work, and so on. Among those who shout "bored out of their minds," there are probably some who "have not actively developed their work." However, using this as a shield is obviously not acceptable. I think their voices and shouts are enough to prove that at least the majority of them are conscious workers who regard work as a pleasure, do as much as they can, and prefer to be busy rather than idle; if they were people who enjoyed being idle and doing nothing, liking to "eat their fill all day long without applying their minds," wouldn't being "idle" be just right, why would they offer opinions, complain, report to higher authorities, and shout loudly?

    Speaking of fear, for some leaders who hold the philosophy that "many hands make light work," it is indeed a bit unpleasant, even a bit frightening, to hear cadres below shouting "bored out of their minds." However, in fact, the shouting of these cadres is like a sick person shouting "I'm sick!" Whether it's appendicitis, requiring surgery; or a bad cold, with a high fever, requiring medicine to reduce the temperature, as long as they know they are sick, there is hope for treatment. What is frightening is that some cadres, although idle all day long, do not "panic," do not shout, but are calm and composed, with a serene state of mind. Unfortunately, in many of our institutions, this kind of person is not an isolated case; they are probably more numerous than those who loudly shout "bored out of their minds."

    Isn't it common to see some comrades spending half a day flipping through newspapers? This is a symbol. Reading the newspaper, although not work, is also not completely idle; it seems to be somewhere between work and idleness, and as some people say, "you can't work without reading the newspaper," so even if you read for half a day or even more than half a day, others can't criticize you, and you can barely feel at ease. Besides, the newspapers in the office today are of many varieties and complete colors. Since there is free time, why not read this one and then that one, read the main section and then the supplement, read the supplement and then the advertisements, know all the major events in the world, and enjoy poetry and sketches! Not to mention doing "calisthenics during work breaks" and chatting, even just reading non-stop, a morning is indeed not enough. Furthermore, in addition to this, there are various internal documents to read, and meetings and reports related to and unrelated to the work of the department to attend and listen to, and there are often various exhibitions to visit… As the saying goes: Time flies like an arrow, the sun and moon like shuttles, and eight hours a day pass very easily. Here, I am by no means saying that reading newspapers, reading documents, listening to reports, visiting exhibitions, etc., are all completely unnecessary; I am saying that the vast majority of these activities are not work in themselves, and many people "work" in this way for half a day, more than half a day, or the whole day. This is ultimately not a normal situation.

    So, why don't these people "panic" and shout, even though they are idle? Is it that they have a habit of "eating their fill all day long without applying their minds"? Probably not. The main reason is that they have become accustomed to and numb to "idleness"; naturally, some have not yet become idle to the point of "panicking." In this way, they no longer want to be "busy," and some have even come to this conclusion: "This is how work is in large institutions!" In this way, day after day, these comrades' vigor is declining, their minds are rusting, their writing skills are becoming less and less flexible, and their actual work ability can no longer be improved… Moreover, precisely because they do not "panic" and do not shout, their illness may not be treated, and there is a danger that the condition will spread and deeply affect them!

    Therefore, I want to cry out for those who don't cry out!

    为不叫喊者叫喊
    弓长静
    最近常常看到报上有“闲得心里发慌”者的呼声。一个满怀热情，想勤恳地为革命做些工作的人，却竟几乎没有工作可做。这一则觉得自己无用武之地，得不到应有的锻炼；二则觉得光吃饭、领薪，对革命无所贡献，心里有愧；因而“发慌”，以至不满，提意见，闹情绪，发牢骚，告状，这是很容易理解，也极令人同情的。
    据说有些领导者很怕下面干部喊“闲得慌”，说并不是没有事做，而是他们没有主动地开展业务，云云。在叫喊“闲得慌”的人中，“没有主动地开展业务”者，恐怕会有的。但是，若以此作为挡箭之牌，显然是不行的。我想，他们的呼声、叫喊，足以证明他们中至少大部分是把工作视为乐事，能多做就多做，愿意忙而不愿意闲的自觉的工作者；如果他们是些以闲而无事为乐，喜欢“饱食终日，无所用心”的人，“闲”了岂不正好，何必去提意见、发牢骚、告状、大喊大叫？
    说到怕，对于有些持“人多好办事”哲学的领导者来说，下面干部喊“闲得慌”的确有些不太悦耳，甚至有点可怕的。然而，其实这些干部的叫喊，就像得了病的人喊出“我有了病！”一样，不管得的是阑尾炎，需要作切除手术；或得的是重感冒，发高烧，需要吃药降温，只要知道得了病，就有了医治的希望。令人可怕的，倒是有些干部虽整天空闲无事，但不“发慌”，不叫喊，安之若素，心情泰然。不幸，在我们许多机关里，这种人并不是个别的，恐怕比大声喊叫“闲得心里发慌”者还要多。
    不是常见有些同志半天半天地翻阅报纸么？这就是象征。看报，虽非工作，但也非完全闲着，它好像介乎工作与闲着之间，而且如有些人所说的“不看报就不能工作”，所以尽管一看就是半天甚至多半天，别人无可厚非，自己也能勉强地心安理得。何况，现今机关的办公室里的报纸，都是品种很多，花色齐全，既然有空闲，何妨看了这份看那份，看了正刊看副刊，看了副刊看广告，尽知天下大事，博赏诗画小品！不要说还要做“工间操”，还要聊聊天之类，就是不停地看，一个上午也的确不够呢。再说，除此以外，还有各种各样的内部文件要看，还有与本部门工作有关的以及无关的会议和报告，要参加，要听，还常有这样那样的展览会要参观……常言道：光阴似箭，日月如梭，一天八小时，自然是很容易过去的。这里，我决不是说，看报、看文件、听报告、参观等等，都一概要不得；是说，这些活动的绝大部分，本身并不就是工作，许多人或半天或多半天或整天就是这样地“工作”，究竟不是正常的气候。
    那末，为什么这些人虽闲却并不“发慌”，不叫喊呢？是他们有了“饱食终日，无所用心”之癖么？恐怕不是。主要是他们对于“闲”，已经习惯了，麻痹了；自然，也有的是因为还没有闲到“发慌”的程度。这样，他们也就不再想“忙”，不是有的竟已得出了这样的结论么：“大机关的工作，就是这样！”就这样，日久天长，这些同志的朝气在衰退，脑子在生锈，笔杆子越来越不灵活，实际工作能力再无从提高……。而且，正因其不“发慌”，不叫喊，他们的病也就可能无从医治，病情就有蔓延和深入膏盲的危险！
    所以，我要为这些不叫喊者叫喊！
