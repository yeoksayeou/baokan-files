Love of the People—The Innate Nature of the People's Army
Helping Shepherds in the Forest Build Cooperatives

	In the dense tung forests of Halakule in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, there is an agricultural cooperative with a rather unusual history.

	This cooperative has only five member households, all of whom were originally shepherds in the forest. In the past, they were almost completely isolated from the outside world, only leaving the forest to go to Awati to exchange for some necessities. When thirsty, they would use gourds to get water to drink; when hungry, they would slaughter sheep to eat. At night, they would cover themselves with old sheepskins and sleep on platforms supported by tree branches, resembling flat-roofed houses.

	In the winter of 1955, soldiers from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, who were reclaiming Halakule, arrived here one after another. At first, the shepherds were wary of these people in military uniforms, because their ancestors had a very tragic experience: more than two hundred years ago, more than 32,000 people lived here. One day, Qing Dynasty soldiers suddenly attacked the forest. The shepherds' leader was killed, the people were scattered, and the fields were abandoned.

	Since the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army settled here, the shepherds saw that these people wearing "August 1st" cap badges went out early and returned late every day, reclaiming wasteland in the wind and snow, and were respectful and kind to people. Gradually, the shepherds were relieved and began to guide the comrades of the army, introducing the soil quality, water sources, climate, and other conditions. Over time, the shepherds in the forest became friends with the soldiers producing here.

	Last spring, in order to help the shepherds change their backward production conditions and impoverished lives, the farm leaders of the army farm personally held discussions with them and conducted interviews. After repeated explanations, they helped these five families organize an agricultural production cooperative. The army then leveled sixty mu of land for them, built houses, and specifically diverted water from the South Main Canal to irrigate their land, and allocated cotton seeds to them. In the spring, the farm also gave them a plow, a horse, and a set of farm tools. From sowing to harvesting, the farm specially sent people to provide technical guidance. More than twenty people in the cooperative learned the general techniques of cotton cultivation. Last year, on the virgin land, they harvested more than 20,000 jin of corn, more than 1,200 jin of cotton, and other crops such as barley and rapeseed for the first time.

	After the autumn harvest, they held a get-together with the comrades of the army. The elderly, young men and women all came. By the blazing bonfire, they danced and sang to their hearts' content, celebrating their new life.

The Grace of Saving a Life

	On January 22nd, in Xinde Street, Zhang'an Town, Jinshan County, Jiangsu Province, nine-year-old Xiao Changrui and his parents welcomed PLA soldier Wang Tingchuan's visit like a relative, thanking him for saving his life. This happened on April 7th last year. That afternoon, on a small earthen mountain east of Zhang'an Town, Jinshan County, three children, Xiao Changrui, Gu Qiuxin, and Jiang Jiafang, were cutting purslane.

	Nine-year-old Xiao Changrui finished cutting purslane and went to the river to wash his hands, when he accidentally fell into the river and was about to sink. At this critical moment of life and death, the sound of "Help!" was heard by Comrade Wang Tingchuan, a soldier from the Military Education Company of the 7092 Unit of the local garrison, who immediately ran to the river. However, the screams and precious time did not allow him to go out the gate and take a detour, so he used the obstacle climbing skills he had mastered to quickly cross two low walls and a fence and ran to the river. At this time, only a corner of the cotton coat of the child who fell into the river could be seen. Without taking off his cotton coat, Comrade Wang Tingchuan jumped into the ice-cold water and rushed to the center of the river, rescuing Xiao Changrui.

	When everyone sent the child home, her parents were moved to tears. Later, Xiao Changrui's parents, in order to thank the benefactor who saved their child's life, prepared to make a silk banner to send to Wang Tingchuan, but because Comrade Wang Tingchuan had been transferred, they searched for more than half a year without finding him. The innocent, lively, and academically excellent Xiao Changrui also often thought about his savior, often saying to her mother: "Where did Uncle Wang go? I want to see him!"

	At noon on January 22nd, Comrade Wang Tingchuan came to the Military Education Company again, and the comrades in the company told him about Xiao Changrui and her parents' concern, so Comrade Wang Tingchuan was very happy to come to Xinde Street to see Xiao Changrui.

	When his relative came, Xiao Changrui's heart was so excited that he panicked and couldn't say a word, but just served tea and candy to Uncle Wang with a flushed face, and then showed Uncle Wang his report card. Finally, he held Uncle Wang's hand and said softly: "Thank you, Uncle, for saving me. I will study hard in the future and live up to your expectations." Her parents said with emotion: "Fortunately, PLA comrade Wang disregarded his own safety and saved my child. How can we repay this great kindness?" Comrade Wang Tingchuan then replied: "It's nothing. This is the responsibility we PLA should fulfill."

Sun Meiling and Captain Yao Guoyu

	Sun Meiling was originally a lively and active mountain student, but not long ago, she suddenly became very quiet. Although her little face was frozen red and her little hands were frozen cold, she used to run outside and play and sing with the children, but now she would sit silently on the kang as soon as school was over, and cough loudly from time to time.

	Her family lives in Nanshan Village, Ganjingzi District, Dalian City. Her father, Sun Dingcheng, is a worker in a cement factory, and her mother is a member of the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative. The kind-hearted parents thought that the child had a cold and would be fine after sweating it out. So they put her on the hottest kang and covered her with a thick quilt, and soon she was covered in sweat. But the child's cough did not lessen. On the contrary, two more layers of illness appeared: one was that her face lost its color, and the other was that she went from sitting quietly to nodding off with her eyes closed.

	Sun Dingcheng and his wife watched their child become like this every day, and their hearts ached as if they were being pierced by ten thousand needles. However, the father, as a worker, was busy with work and study every day, and the mother, as a member of the cooperative, had to participate in the cooperative's activities and take care of household chores. On the one hand, they hoped that the child's illness would slowly get better, and on the other hand, they did not have time to take the child to the hospital several miles away for treatment. Thus, the lovely Sun Meiling was tortured by illness for a long time.

	On December 25th last year, the agricultural cooperative received a phone call: doctors from a certain air force unit of the People's Liberation Army would come to treat the cooperative members tomorrow. This was truly a piece of good news like sending charcoal in the snow for Sun Dingcheng and his wife.

	After breakfast on the 26th, a burst of car sounds came from the biting northwest wind in Nanshan Village, followed by more than a dozen military doctors and nurses.

	It happened that the head of the health team, Captain Yao Guoyu, was the one who received Sun Meiling. Captain Yao determined at a glance that the child was seriously ill, so he immediately sent someone to take her to the air force hospital for fluoroscopy. The fluoroscopy confirmed that Sun Meiling was suffering from a severe lung abscess, which was life-threatening.

	"We must save her life. The current method is to contact the air force hospital and do everything possible to arrange for her to be admitted to the hospital. If her family can't afford the money, I will give her the money to do it!" After careful consideration, Captain Yao said to the instructor. The instructor supported his opinion.

	Sun Meiling, who had never left her parents' side, was reluctant to leave her dear parents and warm home; the parents were also unwilling to let their child leave their side, but Captain Yao was right: "Such a serious illness cannot be cured at home. If it is delayed any longer, it will be difficult to treat. She must be sent to the hospital as soon as possible."

	On December 27th, Captain Yao Guoyu personally took Sun Meiling to a certain air force hospital in the heavy wind and snow. He also specially bought her a pile of candy and left some money.

	Captain Yao was about to return to the team. Sun Meiling grabbed him with her thin little hand and said in her weak voice, "Uncle, don't go!" "I can't stay here. There are many aunts and uncles here to accompany you. You take good care of yourself here. I'll come to see you again when I have time!" Captain Yao comforted her kindly. She didn't say anything, but her big eyes were filled with tears.

    热爱人民——人民军队的天性
    帮助森林中的牧人建社
    在新疆维吾尔自治区哈拉库勒茂密的梧桐林中，有一个历史颇不平常的农业社。
    这个社一共只有五户社员，原来都是森林里的牧人。过去他们几乎与外界隔绝，除非到阿瓦提去换取一些生活必需品，总不离开森林。渴了，他们用葫芦取水喝；饿了，便杀羊吃。晚间，就盖着老羊皮，睡在像平顶房一样的、用树枝撑起的平台上。
    1955年冬天，开垦哈拉库勒的新疆生产建设部队的战士陆续来到这里。开始牧人们对这些穿军装的人总是有着戒心，因为他们的祖先有过一段非常悲惨的遭遇：在二百多年以前，这里本来居住有三万二千多人。一天，清朝的官兵突然向森林进攻。牧人们的首领被杀了，人民妻离子散，逃向四方，田野也荒芜了。
    自从人民解放军的战士们在这儿住下，牧人们看到这些戴着“八一”帽徽的人，天天早出晚归，在风雪中开荒整地，对人又尊重又亲切，于是牧人们渐渐放心了，并且开始给部队的同志们带路，介绍土质、水源、气候等情况。天长日久，森林中的牧人跟在这里生产的战士们交上了朋友。
    去年春天，部队农场为了帮助牧人们改变落后的生产状况和贫困的生活，农场的首长亲自找他们座谈，又进行了访问。经过反复解释，帮助这五户人家组织起了一个农业生产合作社。部队又给他们平了六十亩地，盖了房子，并专门从南干渠引出一股水来给他们浇地，拨给他们棉花种子。春天，农场还送给他们一架犁、一匹马、一付农具。从播种到收割，农场都专门派人去进行技术指导。社里二十多个人都学会了栽培棉花的一般技术。去年他们在处女地上，第一次收获了二万多斤包谷，一千二百多斤棉花，还有大麦、菜籽等作物。
    秋收后，他们和部队的同志进行了联欢。老人、青年男女们都来了。在熊熊的篝火旁，他们尽情地跳舞、歌唱，庆祝自己的新生活。

      救命之恩
      1月22日，在江苏省金山县张埝镇新德街，九岁的小孩萧昌瑞和他的父母，接待亲人一样地欢迎解放军战士王庭川的来访，感谢他的救命之恩。那还是去年4月7日发生的事情。那天下午，金山县张埝镇东边的小土山上，有三个小孩，萧昌瑞、顾秋心、蒋家芳正在割马莱菜。
    九岁的萧昌瑞割好马莱菜，到河边洗手时，失足跌在河里，眼看就要沉没了。正在这千钧一发的生死关头，“救命”的声音给当地驻军七○九二部队军教连的战士王庭川同志听到了，他立即向河边奔去。但是，惨叫的声音，可贵的时间，不允许他出大门绕道而去，于是就利用平时所熟练的爬障碍技术，一刹那，翻过了二垛矮墙和一道篱笆，奔到河边。这时掉在河中的孩子只能看到一只棉衣角了。王庭川同志来不及脱下棉衣，就奋不顾身地跳入冰凉的水中，窜到河心，救出了萧昌瑞。
    当大家把孩子送回家去的时候，她的父母感动得掉下泪来。后来，萧昌瑞的父母为了感谢救孩子命的恩人，曾准备做面锦旗送给王庭川，因王庭川同志调走了，找了半年多没有找到。那天真活泼、品学兼优的萧昌瑞也时常惦念着救命恩人，常常对她的妈妈说：王叔叔到哪儿去了，我要去看看他呀！
      1月22日中午，王庭川同志又来到军教连，连里的同志告诉他关于萧昌瑞和她的父母挂念的情况，于是，王庭川同志非常高兴地到新德街来看萧昌瑞。
    亲人来了，萧昌瑞的心激动得都慌了，却说不出一句话来，只是带着通红的脸给王叔叔送茶、送糖，后又把自己的成绩报告单给王叔叔看，最后握着王叔叔的手小声地说：“谢谢叔叔救了我，我今后要好好学习，不辜负你的期望。”她的父母在旁边感动地说：幸亏解放军王同志不顾自己，救了我的孩子，这种天大的恩，叫我们怎样报答？王庭川同志接着回答说：“算不了什么，这是我们解放军应尽的责任。”

    孙美苓和姚国余大尉
    孙美苓本是一个爱蹦爱跳的山学生，但在不久以前，突然变得非常沉静起来。往日虽然小脸冻得通红，小手冻得冰凉，她还是跑到外边和孩子们去玩呀唱的，现在却一放学便不声不响地坐到炕上，并且不时地大声咳嗽起来。
    她家住在旅大市甘井子区南山村，她的父亲孙鼎成是水泥厂的工人，母亲是金星农业社社员，好心的父母以为孩子是受感冒，发发汗就好了。于是将她放在最热的炕头上，盖上床厚厚的大被，一会儿她就出了满身大汗。可是孩子的咳嗽并没有减轻，相反，又出现两层病：一是小脸没了血，一是她从沉静的坐着坐着变成两眼合拢前仰后合地打瞌睡。
    孙鼎成夫妇眼看着孩子每日如此，真似万针钻心一样地疼。然而当工人的父亲每日忙着工作、学习，当社员的母亲要参加社的活动，还要料理家务。他们一方面抱着孩子的病会慢慢转好起来的希望，一方面也没时间到几里路以外去给孩子治病。就是这样，可爱的孙美苓长期被病魔折磨着。
    去年12月25日，农业社接到一个电话：明天解放军空军某部的医生来给社员们治病。这对孙鼎成夫妇来说，真是一个雪里送炭般的好消息。
    26日早饭后，在南山村，刺骨的西北风传来了一阵汽车叫声，随后送来了十几名军医和护士。
    接诊孙美苓的正好是卫生队长姚国余大尉。姚队长一看就断定这小孩病不轻，便立刻派人送她到空军医院透视。经透视确知孙美苓患着严重的肺脓肿，已经有性命的危险。
      “我们一定要挽救她的生命，目前的办法是和空军医院联系，想尽一切办法安排她到医院里。如果她家中拿不起钱，我给她拿钱也要这样办！”姚队长慎重地考虑之后，向指导员说道。指导员支持他的意见。
    向来没离开过父母身旁的孙美苓，不愿离开她那亲爱的父母和温暖的家；父母也不愿意孩子离开自己身旁，但姚队长说得对：“这样重病在家是绝对养不好的，再拖，将不好治疗，必须赶快送到医院去。”
    12月27日，姚国余大尉冒着漫天的风雪，亲自将孙美苓送到某空军医院里，他还特意为她买了一堆糖，又留下一些钱。
    姚队长要回队了，孙美苓用她那干瘦的小手拉住他，又用她那微弱的声音说“叔叔你别走！”。“我不能留这啊，这里有好多阿姨和叔叔来陪你，你在这好好养病，以后有工夫叔叔再来看你！”姚队长亲切地安慰着她，她不作声了，只是她那双大眼睛里饱含着两汪热泪。
