Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 3rd: Teachers from Chongqing University, at the first scientific discussion meeting held recently at the university, reported on a number of scientific research topics conducted in conjunction with industrial production increase and thrift issues.

Qin Bohong, teaching assistant of the Department of Metallurgy, proposed "Initial Slag of Alkaline Open Hearth Furnace and Mechanization of Slag Removal," and Luo Tingying, lecturer, proposed "Research on Desulfurization of Acidic Slag from Blast Furnace of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company," which aroused great interest among the engineering and technical personnel from factories and mines who were invited to participate in the discussion. When using a higher proportion of pig iron in alkaline open hearth steelmaking, a large amount of slag is generated in the early stage of melting. In the past, these slags were often automatically overflowed or dumped, and the amount and speed of slag discharge could not be controlled manually, and it was easy to carry out molten iron; some factories have adopted a combination of manual slag removal and overflow slag removal, but workers have to bear heavy labor for more than 20 minutes continuously in front of a high-temperature furnace of more than 1,500 degrees Celsius. After a long period of research, Qin Bohong designed a slag removal machine with small body, high slag removal efficiency, simple and flexible structure. This slag removal machine uses a motor to drive the crank shaft and other parts through a reducer to control the slag removal rod to remove the slag in time. Timely slag removal is beneficial to shortening the melting period, prolonging the life of the furnace, improving the operation of slag making and dephosphorization, and improving the quality of steel. This slag removal machine is easy to operate, the parts are economical, and it can prevent the loss of molten iron entrained during slag discharge. During the discussion, the engineers of the factories and mines hoped that this slag removal machine could be successfully developed and put into production as soon as possible, and put forward some suggestions for improvement in the design.

"Several Opinions on the Quality of Boring" was proposed by Yun Daqiong, a teaching assistant in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, after conducting actual investigations and research at machine tool factories in Kunming and other places. Yun Daqiong plans to absorb the opinions in this discussion as a reference for further research.

In order to find more ways to save and more substitutes, veteran professors Jin Xiru, Jiang Daojiang, and Min Chuanjing also squeezed out time to conduct scientific research in this area despite their busy work. Jin Xiru's "Research on Wood Oil-Bearing Bearings" is to use bearings made of oil-bearing wood to replace the metal bearings currently used in textile machines. Now, he has completed the research on oil-bearing wood and the medium-speed and medium-pressure test of oil-bearing cypress wood bearings, and is preparing to continue to conduct tests and research on bearings made of three other kinds of wood, and on the speed and pressure conditions of other grades. Jin Xiru also worked with lecturers and teaching assistants to conduct a "Preliminary Study on the Trial Use of Different Fuels in Domestic Gas Stoves."

Among the scientific papers presented at this scientific discussion meeting, 22 were researched in conjunction with the actual production of factories and mines. When conducting scientific research, teachers at Chongqing University often go to factories and mines to conduct on-the-spot investigations and understanding.

In addition, at this discussion meeting, engineering and technical personnel from factories and mines also presented three scientific research papers to discuss and study with the teachers.

    重庆大学教师深入厂矿生产单位
    结合工业增产节约进行科学研究
    新华社重庆3日电　重庆大学的教师们，在学校里最近举行的第一次科学讨论会上，报告了许多结合工业增产节约问题所作的科学研究题目。
    冶金系助教秦伯弘提出的“碱性平炉的初期渣及扒渣机械化”，和讲师罗廷英对“重庆钢铁公司高炉酸性渣脱硫的研究”，引起了应邀参加讨论会的厂矿工程技术人员很大兴趣。在碱性平炉炼钢采用生铁配料的比例较高时，熔化初期要生成大量的渣。这些渣过去往往是自动溢出或倾倒出去，放渣量与速度都不能人为控制，而且容易把铁水带出；有的厂虽采用了人工扒渣与溢渣相结合，但工人要在摄氏一千五百多度的高温炉前连续担负二十多分钟的繁重劳动。秦伯弘经过长时间的研究，设计了一种机体小，扒渣效率高，结构简单灵活的扒渣机。这种扒渣机，是由电动机通过减速箱传动曲柄轴等机件，控制扒渣杆及时把渣扒出。及时扒出渣对缩短熔化期，延长炉子寿命，改善造渣、去磷的操作和钢的质量都有好处。这种扒渣机容易操作，机件又经济，同时可以防止放渣时夹带铁水的损耗。讨论中，厂矿的工程师们都希望这种扒渣机能早日研究成功投入生产，并且对设计方面提出了一些改进意见。
    “对于绞孔质量的几点意见”，是机械系助教云大燆到昆明等地机床厂作过实际调查研究后提出的。云大燆准备吸收这次讨论中的意见，作为进一步研究时的参考。
    为了找出更多的节约途径和更多的代用品，老教授金锡如、蒋导江、闵传经等也在工作繁忙的情况下，挤出时间来进行这方面的科学研究。金锡如所作的“木质含油轴承的研究”，就是要用含油的木材所作的轴承来代替目前纺织机器中所采用的金属轴承。现在，他已经完成了木材含油的研究和含油柏木轴承的中级轴速、中级轴压的试验，还准备继续进行其他三种木材做轴承，和其他级的轴速、轴压情况下的试验研究工作。金锡如还和讲师、助教等共同作了“国产煤气炉试用不同燃料的初步研究”。
    这次科学讨论会提出的科学论文中，有二十二篇是结合厂矿生产的实际进行研究的。重庆大学的教师们在进行科学研究时，经常到厂矿生产单位去实地调查和了解。
    另外，在这次讨论会上，厂矿生产单位的工程技术人员也提出三篇科学研究论文，和教师们一起讨论研究。
