Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 9th: The Third Congress of the China Democratic League's Fujian Provincial Organization was held in Fuzhou from February 5th to 8th, with over 100 delegates attending.

The China Democratic League's Fujian local organization has developed rapidly in the past year, and has now established municipal committees in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou, with sixty-two grassroots organizations. Among the League members, more than 100 have served as representatives to the provincial and municipal People's Congresses and members of the CPPCC, and many others have served as members of the provincial and municipal People's Committees and other leadership positions. League members in universities and colleges have completed 114 scientific papers and published nine scientific works in the past two years; League members in primary and secondary schools have also created many teaching aids and teaching experiences.

At the congress, the delegates unanimously agreed that the League members had been greatly encouraged after the Chinese Communist Party put forward the principles of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." The delegates stated that they would continue to earnestly implement these principles in the future, promote cooperation between League members and all parties under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice thrift. The delegates also proposed to learn from the Communist Party members' hard-working and simple style and strengthen the ideological remolding of intellectuals in order to play a greater role in socialist construction.

The congress also elected Lin Zhifu, He Gonggan, Zhang Chukun, Zhang Zhuangfei, Huang Luping, and 17 others as members of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League.

    新华社福州9日电　中国民主同盟福建省第三次代表大会5日到8日在福州市举行，参加大会的代表有一百多人。
    中国民主同盟福建省地方组织最近一年来发展很快，目前已经在福州、厦门和泉州三个市成立了市委员会，拥有六十二个基层组织。在盟员中，有一百多人分别担任了省、市人民代表大会代表和政协委员，还有不少人担任了省、市人民委员会委员和其他各种领导职务。在高等学校中的盟员，两年来完成了一百十四篇科学论文，已经出版九种科学著作；在中、小学校的盟员也创造了许多教具和教学经验。
    在这次大会上，代表们一致认为，在中国共产党提出“长期共存，互相监督”、“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针以后，盟员们都受到了很大鼓舞。代表们表示今后将继续认真贯彻这些方针，在中国共产党领导下，推动盟员和各方面搞好合作共事关系，积极参加增产节约运动。代表们还提出要学习共产党员的艰苦朴素作风，加强知识分子的思想改造工作，以便在社会主义建设中发挥更大作用。
    这次大会还选举了林植夫、何公敢、张楚琨、张壮飞、黄绿萍等二十二人为中国民主同盟福建省委员会委员。
