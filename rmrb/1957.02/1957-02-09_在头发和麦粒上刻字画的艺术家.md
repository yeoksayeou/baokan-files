Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. According to the Soviet "Culture Newspaper", a peculiar package was recently sent from Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Republic, to Berlin. It was a small marble box containing a smooth strand of hair one centimeter long. If you look at the hair with a magnifying glass, you can see the German words "The Armenian people send brotherly greetings to the German people" neatly engraved on it.

This is the latest masterpiece of Kasaryan, an Armenian sculptor. He recently received a letter from a reader forwarded by the German "Berliner Zeitung", inquiring about his work and expressing doubt about the newspaper's report that he had carved a tractor on half a grain of wheat. Kasaryan decided to answer him with this carving.

Kasaryan has created many exquisite small objects, including the world's smallest violin, which is only fourteen millimeters long and half a gram in weight. He once carved a complete opera house on the head of an ordinary pin, and landscapes on grains of rice. These items can only be seen clearly with a magnifying glass.

He is currently making a gift for the World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship. It is a pin with two internal combustion locomotives and seventy-five carriages engraved on the head. The train is also engraved with the words "The first grain from the virgin land is dedicated to the motherland." Before the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, he will complete another work. He will carve a picture of Lenin talking to soldiers on a three-centimeter-long boxwood stick.

    在头发和麦粒上刻字画的艺术家
    新华社莫斯科8日电　据苏联“文化报”报道，最近从亚美尼亚共和国首都埃里温向柏林寄去了一件奇特的包裹，它是一只大理石小匣，里面藏着一公分长的一根光洁的头发。如果拿着放大镜去照那根头发，便可以看出上面整齐地刻着的德文“亚美尼亚人民向德国人民致兄弟的敬礼”。
    这是亚美尼亚一位雕刻家卡萨尔扬最近的杰作。他不久前收到了德国“柏林日报”转来的一封读者来信，询问他的工作情况，并且对报纸上登载的关于他曾经在半颗麦粒上雕刻过一辆拖拉机的消息表示怀疑。卡萨尔扬就决定用这件雕刻品来回答他。
    卡萨尔扬已经制作过不少精巧的小物件。其中包括一把世界上最小的提琴，它只有十四公厘长、半公分重。他曾在一根普通的大头针的头上，雕刻了一座完整的歌舞剧院；在米粒上雕刻风景。这些东西都只能用放大镜才能看得清楚。
    现在，他正在制作一件献给世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的礼物。它是一根大头针，针头上刻着两辆内燃机车和七十五节车厢。在列车上还刻着一行字“处女地上的第一批粮食献给祖国”。在十月革命四十周年纪念以前，他还要完成另一件作品。他要在一根三公分长的黄杨木小棍上雕刻一幅列宁和士兵谈话图。
