    In the People's Reception Room of the District People's Committee, I received a rather pleasant young man. Judging by his age, he couldn't have been more than twenty-one or two years old, with fluffy, curly hair, a strand of which lightly brushed his forehead. A pair of round, bright eyes made him appear simple yet intelligent; however, his cheeks were somewhat thin, shrouded in a sorrow that didn't quite match his intelligence.

    I politely asked the young man to sit down and, as usual, inquired about the purpose of his visit. He didn't speak immediately, but I clearly saw his lips tremble with effort. He then took out two very worn newspapers from his pocket, found a short poem and a short story in the newspapers, and pointed to the signature above, saying:

    "This is my pen name."

    "So, you are a young writer!" I said.

    His face seemed to flush slightly, but he remained silent. He then took out a thick stack of letters and placed them on the table, saying:

    "These are all rejection letters."

    I noticed that the envelopes were all from well-known domestic literary publications.

    Oh! So he came to denounce those editors for not valuing new talent. That's what I thought to myself.

    But he hurriedly said, "I'm not here today because of these rejection letters. I'm here to ask you... to ask you to recommend me for a job... preferably as a fitter."

    This left me somewhat bewildered.

    "So, you're requesting a job change? To experience the life of a fitter?"

    He shook his head. After a moment, he sighed again, his eyes unconsciously looking at his hands, which were fidgeting with each other, and said in a low voice:

    "Yes, I plan to tell you everything." He paused, "But I hope you can keep it a secret for me."

    I agreed to his request. At this point, I noticed that his cheeks had become completely flushed, with a hint of nervousness, since I didn't know when.

    "It's like this," he began his narrative rather awkwardly. "I was originally a fitter at the joint state-private Da Tong Machine Factory. I had studied junior high school for two years, and I usually liked to write limericks on the factory's blackboard newspaper, sometimes satirizing things I didn't like. To be honest, at that time, whether it was workers or cadres in our factory, they were all afraid of me catching their mistakes! Of course! My production has always been pretty good, and a year ago, I was even awarded a third-class advanced producer.

    "On the night of the award ceremony, I lay down for a long time but couldn't fall asleep. I don't know where the energy came from, but I got up again and, according to my mood at the time, wrote an article for the blackboard newspaper. The article was written in the form of a poem, and the next day, the poem appeared on the blackboard newspaper. Everyone said it was very good, and of course, I was very happy myself. The trade union's cultural and educational committee asked me to copy it and send it to the newspaper office. 'Send it, then send it!' That's how I casually sent it to the city's 'Worker's Daily' office. Hey! I really didn't expect that the newspaper would publish it so quickly!" He smiled happily, and even I felt a little happy for him. At this point, he was no longer nervous, and his words flowed out like a rushing stream through a mountain valley.

    "After this, my courage grew. I spent another three Sundays writing a story about the labor competition in our factory. It's this one." He picked up another newspaper; it was folded, so I didn't see clearly what newspaper it was.

    "The Little Wang inside is me, and the Party branch secretary and factory director are our Party branch secretary and factory director.... Things went wrong as soon as this manuscript was published...." He slapped his palm on his knee.

    "Things went wrong after the manuscript was published?" I asked eagerly.

    "Yes!" He took a deep breath.

    "As soon as the manuscript was published, 'writer'! 'poet'! These titles were constantly ringing in my ears. My brother, who is a primary school teacher, also wrote to me after he found out, saying that he had always understood my talent; he also said that he had seen my talent as a writer from my compositions in elementary school; saying that it was a pity for me to be an ordinary worker! That I should become an 'engineer of the human soul'!... I began to re-evaluate myself. I thought: being a writer must be many times better than being a worker! I don't know how it happened, but from then on, the vise I used became heavier and heavier every day; the roaring sound in the workshop became more and more noisy and irritating every day. I simply quit my job." He smiled bitterly and looked up at me embarrassedly.

    "The situation afterwards was simple. To create conditions, I relied on several hundred yuan of savings to first go to various places to experience life, I travelled to Suzhou, Hangzhou, and then went to Beijing and Tianjin. My savings were used up, and I wrote several hundred pages of manuscript, what I got was this thick stack!" He picked up the rejection letters and threw them on the table.

    "The last few months have been so difficult. I am a resolute person, if I can't write, I rack my brains to think; if it doesn't look good, I revise it again and again. I used the greatest willpower to restrain myself, and finally wrote ten or so poems and three short stories. Who would have thought that one rejection letter after another would be like gusts of cold wind, not only blowing out the flames of hope in my heart, but also making my heart tremble. Indeed, I also scolded the editors, and when I was anxious, I even went to their doors. Their talks calmed me down a lot... Now I know I was wrong.

    "No, I'm not saying that I can't write, maybe I'll become a real writer in the future. Do you believe it? But it's better not to talk about these things now, it's for the future. What bothers me most now is the longing for that kind of work from the past. You know, how much I yearn for that kind of intense, boiling life! That kind of work gives me real happiness."

    "Maybe writers have their real happiness when they write," he continued, as if talking to himself. "But what about me? Apart from the two manuscripts published in the newspaper that once made my head spin, I really didn't experience the real joy of writing. Alas! What are these things I'm writing now!" He looked at me with a thoughtful look. "The work that can give a person the most real joy is probably this person's best work, comrade, do you think that's right?"

    I agreed with his view. But I added my opinion: the joy of work can be transformed, and I also talked about some great principles such as "the truly lasting joy of work lies in a deep understanding of the significant social significance of the work itself." He interrupted me.

    "Last time I met the Party branch secretary of the factory, he told me that the factory still hoped that I would go back, and if I was willing to return to work, he was planning to recommend me to be responsible for the factory's blackboard newspaper. But, comrade, think about it, what face do I have to go back to the factory? I said I didn't want to go back to the original factory no matter what. So I ask the government to forgive me, help me, and introduce me to a job! Good comrade! I have told you everything, please help me get back on the road of life! I will never lie, my skills are still the same as before, and..."

    After listening to his talk, I couldn't calm down for a long time. The vivid experience of this young worker raises an important issue worthy of deep thought for us.

    一个来访者的经历
    子中
    在区人民委员会的人民接待室里，我接见了一个挺不错的青年人。看年纪他顶多不过二十一、二岁，蓬松鬈曲的头发，有一缕轻拂在前额上，一双圆溜溜的眼睛使他显得单纯而又聪颖；只是两颊有些消瘦，笼罩了一层和他的聪颖不调和的愁容。
    我客气地请这位小伙子坐下，照例问他有什么事情来访。他没有立即开口，但是我清楚地看到他的嘴唇费力地颤动了一下，接着从衣袋里拿出了两张十分破旧的报纸，找到了报纸上的一首短诗和一篇小故事，指了指上面的署名说：
    “这是我的笔名。”
    “您原来是一个青年作者！”我说。
    他的脸似乎微微红了，仍旧没有作声。他又拿出了厚厚的一叠信，放在桌子上说：
    “这些都是退稿信。”
    我注意到了那些信封，都是国内知名文艺刊物寄给他的。
    噢！原来他是来控诉那些编辑们不重视新生力量呀。我心里这样想。
    但他急忙地说：“我今天来并不是为了这些退稿信的事。我来这里是想请你们……请你们给我介绍一个工作……最好是钳工。”
    这使我有些茫然了。
    “那么，您是要求调换工作岗位吧？为了要去体验一下钳工的生活吗？”
    他摇摇头。停了一会，又叹了口气，眼睛下意识地看着他那两只在互相摆弄着的手，用低沉的声音说：
    “是啊，我是打算把全部情况都告诉您的。”他顿了一顿，“但是我希望您能为我保守秘密。”
    我答应他的要求。这时我发现，不知道从什么时候起，他的面颊已经完全涨红，还带有几分紧张的神色。
    “是这样，”他很局促地开始了他的叙述。“我本来是在公私合营大同机器厂当钳工。我曾经读过两年初中，平时就喜欢在厂里的黑板报上写写打油诗，有时对看不顺眼的事讽刺讽刺。老实说，那个时候我们厂里不管是工人还是干部，都怕让我抓住小辫子呢！当然啦！我的生产一直还是蛮不错的，一年前，我还被评上了个三等先进生产者。
    “在给奖大会的那天晚上，我躺下好久，怎么也睡不着。不知道哪里来的一股劲，使我又爬了起来，依照当时的心情，写成了一篇黑板报稿子。稿子是按照诗的样子写的，第二天这首诗便出现在黑板报上了，大家都说很好，当然我自己也很高兴。工会的文教委员让我抄一份给报社寄去，‘寄去就寄去！’当时我就这样随随便便地寄给了市‘工人报’社。嘿！真想不到，报纸很快就给登出来了！”他愉快地笑了笑，连我也有点替他高兴了。这时他已经不再紧张，他的话就像一条急湍的小河流过山涧一样地滔滔地倾泄出来。
    “这一下我的胆子可就大起来啦。又用了三个星期天的时间，写了我们厂里劳动竞赛的一个故事。就是这个。”他拿了拿另一份报纸，报纸折叠着，我没有看清楚是份什么报。
    “这里面的小王便是我自己，党支部书记和厂长就是我们的党支书和厂长……。这篇稿子一登出来可就糟了……。”他的手掌在膝盖上打了一下。
    “稿子登出来了，怎么倒会糟了呢？”我急切地问。
    “是啊！”他深深地抽了口气。
    “稿子一登出来，什么‘作家’呀！
    ‘诗人’呀，便成天价在我耳朵边响起来了。我那位做小学教师的哥哥，在知道以后也写信来，说什么他是一向了解我的才能的；还说什么他从我在小学里的作文中，便看出了我有成为一个作家的天赋；说什么我当个普通工人实在太可惜呀！什么我应该成为一个‘人类灵魂的工程师’呀！……我就开始重新估计自己了。我想：当个作家，一定比当个工人要好不知多少倍吧！不知道怎么搞的，从此以后我手里使的钳床变得一天比一天重起来；车间中的轰隆声变得一天比一天喧嚣而令人烦躁了。我干脆辞掉了工作。”他苦笑了一下，不好意思地抬头望望我。
    “以后的情况很简单，为了创造条件，我靠了几百元的积蓄，先到各地去体验生活，游了苏州、杭州，又去了北京、天津。储蓄花光了，稿纸也写了好几百张，得到的就是这厚厚的一叠！”他拿起那些退稿信往桌子上一摔。
    “最近几个月的日子多么艰难啊，我是一个坚毅的人，写不出，我绞干了脑汁地去想；看看不像样，就改一遍又一遍。我用最大的意志克制着自己，终于写出了十来首诗和三个短篇小说。谁想到一封封的退稿信，就像是一阵阵的冷风，它不仅吹熄了我心头一烛烛希望的火焰，简直是把我的心也吹得一阵阵发抖。确实，我也曾骂过编辑，在我气急的时候还上门找过他们，他们的谈话，使我平静了许多……现在我知道，是我想错了。
    “不，我并不是说我不能写作，也许我将来会成为一个真正的作家。你相信吗？不过现在还是不要谈这些的好，这是以后的事。现在最苦恼着我的是对于从前那种工作的渴念，你知道，我是多么向往着从前那种紧张、沸腾的生活啊！那种工作给我的是真正的快乐。”
    “也许作家有他们写作时真正的快乐，”他接着好像自言自语地说。“可我呢？除了报纸上发表的两篇稿子曾经冲昏了我的脑袋以外，实在没有体验到写作的真正乐趣。唉！我现在写的这些东西又是些什么呢！”他用一种深思的眼神望着我。“最能使一个人产生真正乐趣的工作，大概就是这个人的最好的工作吧，同志，你说对吗？”
    我表示同意他的看法。但是又补充说明我的意见：工作的乐趣是可以转换的，而且还讲了一些“真正持久的工作乐趣，是在于对工作本身的重大社会意义的深刻理解”等等大道理。他打断了我的话。
    “上次我碰到厂里的党支部书记，他告诉我说厂里还希望我回去，如果我愿意回厂复工的话，他倒打算推荐我负责厂里的黑板报。可是，同志，你想想我有什么脸回厂呢？我说什么也不想回原厂了。所以我请求政府能够原谅我，帮助我，给我介绍个工作！好同志！我已经统统对你讲了，请你千万帮助我重新回到生活的道路上来！我决不说谎，我的技术还照样的熟练，而且……。”
    听了他的谈话，我久久不能平静下来。这位青年工人的活生生的经历，向我们提出了一个值得深思的重要问题。
