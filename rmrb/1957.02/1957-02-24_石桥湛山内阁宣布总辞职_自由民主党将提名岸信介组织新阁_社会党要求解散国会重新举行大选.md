Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese government and leaders of the ruling party held a temporary cabinet meeting this afternoon and formally decided that the Ishibashi cabinet would announce its resignation, and immediately notified the Diet of this decision.

　　The Ishibashi cabinet took office on December 23 last year, succeeding the Hatoyama cabinet. However, only a month after Prime Minister Ishibashi Tanzan took office, he was unable to perform his duties due to bronchial pneumonia. Last night, doctors diagnosed that the 72-year-old new prime minister would need to continue to rest for two months. Therefore, Ishibashi decided to resign. He wrote to the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, saying that his resignation was to avoid political turmoil within the country and within the Liberal Democratic Party, and called on the entire party to unite and avoid factional infighting.

　　According to Kyodo News, Liberal Democratic Party leaders have decided to nominate the Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Kishi Nobusuke as the successor to form a cabinet. This matter will be formally decided tomorrow by the Liberal Democratic Party Diet members' meeting and submitted to the Diet for approval on the 25th. Kishi Nobusuke, the former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, is the head of a powerful group within the Liberal Democratic Party. After Ichiro Hatoyama's retirement, Kishi Nobusuke competed with Ishibashi for the party presidency, losing by seven votes. His group held four seats in the Ishibashi cabinet.

　　In the first Diet session held since the establishment of the Ishibashi cabinet, the opposition parties repeatedly demanded that the Ishibashi cabinet implement a truly independent policy. In view of Ishibashi's long-term absence from the Diet, the Socialist Party strongly demanded Ishibashi's resignation, the dissolution of the Diet, and a general election. The Socialist Party's leadership meeting decided on February 20 that if Ishibashi was absent from the Diet for a long time, the Socialist Party would oppose the Diet's deliberation of the 1957 fiscal year budget.

　　Kyodo News estimates that due to this political change, the possibility of dissolving the House of Representatives after the Diet passes the budget has greatly increased.

　　Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd Dispatch: According to Kyodo News: US government officials are concerned about the future development of the Japanese political situation.

　　They believe that Japanese Foreign Minister Kishi Nobusuke has so far pursued a "prudent" foreign policy. If Kishi Nobusuke becomes Prime Minister, the United States is not too worried. US government officials do not believe that the new cabinet formed after Ishibashi Tanzan's resignation will change Japan's attitude.

　　The news also said that British experts on Japanese affairs believe that the resignation of the Ishibashi cabinet may make the Japanese political situation more chaotic.

　　Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today demanding the dissolution of the Diet and a new general election.

　　After discussing the Japanese political situation following the resignation of the Ishibashi cabinet, the Socialist Party's leadership organization stated that it opposes the Liberal Democratic Party privately awarding and receiving power within the party. The Socialist Party believes that any successor cabinet to the Ishibashi cabinet can only be a caretaker cabinet. The Socialist Party will nominate its chairman, Suzuki Mosaburo, as the candidate for head of this cabinet, to compete with the Liberal Democratic Party's candidate.

　　Japanese business circles hope that Foreign Minister Kishi Nobusuke, who is serving as acting Prime Minister, will become Prime Minister, minimize changes to the original cabinet ministers, and quickly enable the Diet to continue its work on deliberating the budget.

　　Major Japanese newspapers today published comments on the resignation of the Ishibashi cabinet. Most newspapers demanded that the Diet be dissolved and a general election held as soon as possible after the budget is passed.

    石桥湛山内阁宣布总辞职
    自由民主党将提名岸信介组织新阁
    社会党要求解散国会重新举行大选
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本政府和执政党首脑今天下午举行内阁临时会议，正式决定石桥内阁宣布总辞职，并且立刻把这个决定通知了国会。
    石桥内阁是在去年12月23日继鸠山内阁上台的。但是首相石桥湛山刚上任一个月就因患支气管肺炎不能执行职务。昨天晚上，医生经过诊断认为这位七十二岁的新首相还要继续休养两个月。于是，石桥决定提出辞职。他写信告诉自由民主党的领袖们说，他的辞职是为了避免国内和自由民主党内部的政治混乱，并且呼吁全党团结一致，避免党内派系斗争。
    据共同社报道，自由民主党领袖们已经确定要提名临时代理首相、外务相岸信介为继任组阁首长，这件事将在明天由自由民主党国会议员大会作出正式决定，并且在25日提交国会通过。岸信介前任自由民主党干事长，是自由民主党内一个有势力的集团的首脑。在鸠山一朗退休以后，岸信介曾与石桥竞选党的总裁职务，以七票之差落选。他的集团在石桥内阁中占有四席。
    在石桥内阁成立以来第一次召开的国会会议中，在野党一再要求石桥内阁执行真正独立自主的政策。社会党鉴于石桥长期不能出席国会，强烈要求石桥下台，解散国会，举行大选。社会党的首脑会议在2月20日又决定，如果石桥长期不出席国会，社会党将反对国会审议1957财政年度的预算案。
    共同社估计，由于这次政局变化，在国会通过预算案以后，众议院解散的可能性已经大大增加。
    新华社23日讯　据共同社报道：美国政府官员对今后日本政局的发展表示关心。
    他们认为，日本外务相岸信介迄今为止一直推行了“稳健的”外交政策，如果岸信介出任首相，美国是不大担心的。美国政府官员不相信石桥湛山辞职后组成的新内阁会改变日本的态度。
    消息又说，英国熟悉日本问题的人士认为，石桥内阁的辞职可能使日本政局更加混乱。
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，要求解散国会，重新举行大选。
    社会党的领导机构在讨论了石桥内阁总辞职后的日本政局以后表示，反对自由民主党在党内私自授受政权。社会党认为，任何石桥内阁的后继内阁都只能是一个看守内阁。社会党将提名它的委员长铃木茂三郎为这个内阁的组阁首长候选人，同自由民主党的候选人竞选。
    日本实业界人士希望由临时代理首相职务的外务相岸信介来担任首相，尽量不更动原内阁的大臣，并且迅速使国会继续进行审议预算案的工作。
    日本各大报今天都对石桥内阁辞职这件事发表了评论，大多数报纸要求在国会通过预算案以后尽快解散国会，举行大选。
