Guangze County Farmers Apply Base Fertilizer Early

(Reported by this newspaper) Farmers in most villages in Guangze County, Fujian Province, have already applied base fertilizer to their spring耕 fields in advance. In Ma Agricultural Cooperative and 74 other advanced cooperatives alone, more than 400,000 dan of fertilizer have been cleared from more than 15,000 pig and cattle pens in recent days, and applied to more than 30,000 mu of land, averaging 12 dan per mu. After the Yangtang Advanced Cooperative mobilized the transportation of fertilizer to the fields, the more than 400 mu of land prepared for planting double-cropping rice have been applied with an average of more than 80 dan of fertilizer such as pond mud and turf per mu. Yunji, Qingxi, Youxi and other townships have adopted the method of collecting materials locally, accumulating fertilizer locally, and using it locally, and have dug more than 100 manure pits in the fields, and trampled the cut field embankment grass into the fields as base fertilizer.

    光泽县农民提早施基肥
    本报讯　福建光泽县大部分乡村已提早在春耕的田地里施下基肥。仅马农业社等七十五个高级社，近日来已从一万五千多个猪、牛栏中清出了四十余万担肥料，施在三万多亩的田地里，平均每亩达十二担。洋塘高级社发动挑肥下田后，四百多亩准备种植双季稻的田地，每亩平均已下塘泥、草皮等肥料八十多担。云际、清溪、油溪等乡采用就地取材、就地积肥、就地使用的办法，已在田头挖了一百余个粪堀，并把劈下的田塝草踩入田中作基肥。
