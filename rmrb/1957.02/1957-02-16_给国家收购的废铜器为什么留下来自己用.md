    Why Keep Nationally Purchased Scrap Copperware for Personal Use?

    In recent years, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have actively carried out the acquisition of scrap copper and tin, playing a significant role in supporting national construction. However, some cadres, driven by petty greed, have kept some of the acquired old copper and tin utensils for their own use. In the eleven grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Wuyuan County, Jiangxi Province, that I have visited, staff members have, to varying degrees, "accumulated" some furniture and utensils in this way, such as copper basins, copper stoves, copper rulers, copper mirrors, tin basins, tin kettles, hot pots, etc., all acquired for personal use at scrap copper and tin prices. As a result, this batch of copper and tin cannot be used where the country needs it most. I hope that grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives with similar situations in various regions will quickly hand over the withheld old copper and tin utensils to the state through normal procedures, so that they can play a role in the country's industrialization.

    给国家收购的废铜器为什么留下来自己用
    几年来，各地基层供销合作社积极开展废铜、废锡的收购工作，对支援国家建设起了很大作用。但是在这中间，有某些干部由于贪小利，把一些收购的旧铜、锡器皿留下来自用。我所走过的江西婺源县十一个基层供销合作社的工作人员，都程度不同地从这方面“积累”了一些家具和用具，如铜盆、铜炉、铜尺、铜镜、锡盆、锡壶、暖锅等等，都以废铜、废锡的价格收购下来自用。这样，这批铜、锡就不能用到国家最需要的地方去了。我希望各地有这类情况的基层供销合作社，把扣留下来的旧铜、锡器皿赶快按正常手续交给国家，让它们为祖国工业化发挥作用。　汪人杰
