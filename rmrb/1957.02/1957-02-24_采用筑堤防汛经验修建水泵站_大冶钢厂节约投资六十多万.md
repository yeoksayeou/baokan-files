(Our Wuhan dispatch, February 21) Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has adopted China's experience in building dikes for flood prevention to construct the Daye Steel Plant's pumping station project, saving more than 650,000 yuan in funds. This sum of money could be used to build another two and a half pumping stations of the same scale, and the construction period could also be shortened by one year.

The original plan for the Daye Steel Plant's pumping station was to use the "island building and freezing caisson method" for construction. This method required more than 60 tons of steel sheet piles, more than 1,700 meters of seamless steel pipes, four freezers, and 5,000 cubic meters of filling soil, as well as the coordination of various construction machinery. In this way, the special construction costs required for this project would be more than 700,000 yuan.

Initially, due to a lack of the above conditions, the company decided to use China's method of building dikes for flood prevention for construction. During the construction process, they boldly blasted away the bank slope, flattened the riverbed, and directly poured concrete from the riverbed, based on the local geological conditions. In this way, the pumping station project did not use a single steel sheet pile or a single seamless steel pipe, and was built more than two meters above the water surface, which can strive to be completed during this year's flood season.

### 采用筑堤防汛经验修建水泵站  大冶钢厂节约投资六十多万

    采用筑堤防汛经验修建水泵站
    大冶钢厂节约投资六十多万
    本报武汉21日电　武汉冶金建筑总公司采用我国筑堤防汛的经验来修建大冶钢厂的水泵站工程，节约了资金六十五万多元。这笔钱可以再建同样规模的两个半水泵站，工期还可缩短一年。
    大冶钢厂水泵站原计划采用“筑岛冷冻沉井法”施工。这种方法需要六十多吨钢板桩、一千七百多公尺无缝钢管、四台冷冻机和填土五千立方，还要各种施工机械配合。这样，这个工程所需的特殊施工费用就要七十万多元。
    这个公司最初因为缺乏上述条件，决定采用我国筑堤防汛的办法施工。在施工中，他们又根据当地的地质条件，大胆地炸去岸坡、削平江底，直接从江底浇灌混凝土。这样，这个水泵站工程就没有用一块钢板桩和一根无缝钢管，而修出了水面两公尺多，可以争取在今年汛期完工。
