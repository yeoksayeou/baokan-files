Editor's Note: February only has twenty-eight days and includes the Spring Festival, making it the month with the shortest production time and the most difficult to complete the state plan. Now, news has come of some advanced workers and units completing their plans ahead of schedule, which is undoubtedly encouraging news in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. Their strong determination to complete the state plan and their positive spirit in overcoming difficulties are worth learning from.

    Firing the First Shot
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Works' No. 1 Steel Plant, which overproduced 5,700 tons of steel for the state in January, overproduced another 1,700 tons of steel for the state in twenty-four days in February.
    In February, the steelworkers of No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace fired the first shot, completing the February state plan four days ahead of schedule. At the No. 1 and No. 2 sister open hearth furnaces, the steelworkers launched a warm friendly competition. The workers of No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace used rapid steelmaking methods to produce sixty-seven heats of steel in twenty-four days in February. The workers of No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace also shortened the time for smelting each heat of steel compared to the state plan. Li Shangzhong, a famous steelmaking expert from No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace, told reporters that the steelworkers of this open hearth furnace also expressed their intention to strive to complete the February state plan one or two days ahead of schedule.

    Forging Workers Show Their Skills
    These days, in the huge workshop of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Works' Forging Workshop, three steam hammers are tirelessly hammering blood-red steel ingots. The forging workers, who completed the February production plan seven days ahead of schedule, are working with full confidence to produce 520 tons more steel for the entire month.
    In February, the workers of the Forging Workshop all showed their skills and invested in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. Nine production teams exceeded their production tasks by 1% to over 20% in the first three weeks of February, and the product quality was further improved.
    Engineer Yuan Wenlong and veteran workers Liu Ergou, Tao Peng, Xin Xiaochun, and others, after collective research, made significant changes to the forging process specifications this month—changing the original "two-fire forging" to "joint one-fire operation." This change means that after the steel ingot is opened, it is forged into a finished product without reheating, which reduces the loss of 15 kilograms of iron oxide scale per ton of steel, saves 120 kilograms of raw coal, and significantly improves the internal and external quality of the steel.

    Everything for More Coal
    The miners of the Jingsi Mining Bureau completed the February coal mining plan four days ahead of schedule. The coal mined by the miners in February this year was more than in any February since liberation. The coal mining volume from the 1st to the 24th was one-third more than the entire month of February last year.
    The production preparation meeting of Production Team 5 of the Mentougou Mine used to be held at the working face underground, and the meeting often took up ten or twenty minutes of production time. In February, they moved the production preparation meeting to the surface to use their spare time. In this way, they not only made full use of working hours, but also everyone knew what work to do today before going down the well, so they could carry out production smoothly at the working face. As a result, this group set two new records.
    After a cycle of work underground, the miners of Excavation Team 8 of the Chengzi Mine often had to wait for coal trucks. In early February, team leader Zhang Shiqing led everyone to find a solution. Everyone remembered the two-stage slotting method previously adopted by the rock excavation team. Although it took one-third more time to complete a cycle than the "one-stage slotting" currently used, the excavation footage was also one-third more, which could avoid the waiting time for trucks. After implementing this method, the group completed the February production plan twelve days ahead of schedule.

    In the Severe Cold of Karamay
    On the morning of the 20th, when the sun broke through the hazy morning fog and just rose on the Gobi Desert, the early shift workers of the Karamay No. 225 Drilling Team ended a night of intense labor. Each of them was covered with a shining armor of mud ice, but their underwear was soaked with sweat. They were all very happy, talking and laughing, without a trace of fatigue. It turned out that in their shift, they completed the team's monthly footage plan of 700 meters ahead of schedule, and exceeded it by 32 meters.

    Drillers on the Weibei Coalfield
    At eight o'clock on the morning of the 24th, it was snowing heavily in the Tongchuan Mining Area of the Weibei Coalfield. After the shift change, Song Fengqi, the leader of the Song Fengqi drilling rig, and four drillers braved the snow. The recorder Guo Jiayou said, "Now, we have drilled one hundred and seventy meters." Song Fengqi added, "This is two and a half meters more than our February plan."
    The sound of the conversation was immediately drowned out by the "clatter" of the diesel engine. This was the most tense moment for the drilling workers. All five drillers were around the drilling rig, cooperating in their respective positions as a whole. The sharp-eyed Zuo Wuting held the "lifting handle," concentrating on the overall operation. The driller Chen Zewen, who was climbing on the second floor of the derrick, was coordinating with the driller Zhang Junting, who was squatting next to the machine, to move the drill pipes to the crane to lift them. Deputy team leader Xing Qinghai and driller Qi Dongpan then tightly connected the drill pipes. Seeing that the connection was good, Zuo Wuting moved the "lifting handle" to send the drill pipes into the well hole section by section. In less than an hour, forty-five drill pipes were lifted up and put back into the well. As Zuo Wuting shouted, "Add oil!" Xing Qinghai had pressed the "feeding handle." The diesel engine roared and spewed out a plume of black smoke, and the drill pipe successfully drilled forward in excess.

    Exceeding the Quota Every Month, Improving Step by Step
    Wang Minqing, an advanced producer and veteran worker at the Chongqing Water Turbine Factory, completed the February production plan on the 17th. By the 24th, he had overfulfilled the plan by more than 70%, and the quality of his work fully met the specifications.
    In February, Wang Minqing was responsible for the scribing work of the main parts such as the water turbine cover and the air compressor frame in this factory. According to past regulations, the work of scribing water turbine covers and other main parts must be carried out on a specially set platform. However, the water turbine produced by this factory this year is larger than those produced in the past. A single cover weighs more than three tons, and the equipment in the factory responsible for lifting the water turbine cover onto the platform only has a capacity of one and a half tons. Seeing that the water turbine cover could not be placed on the platform, it affected the scribing work. At the beginning of February, Wang Minqing devised a way to creatively change the scribing on the platform to scribing on the factory construction site, which not only solved the equipment problem, but also saved the working hours of the cover going to the platform.
    Wang Minqing has not produced any defective products from last year to the present, and has completed his production tasks ahead of schedule every month. He was rated as an advanced producer of the factory in all four quarters of last year.

    Conquering "Difficulties"
    Wang Zhengyong, a young worker at the Tianjin Forging Machine Tool Factory, completed his February workload five days early and exceeded it by 18%.
    This fifth-grade lathe operator, who had completed the workload of the first Five-Year Plan more than a year ahead of schedule as early as December last year, operates a hexagonal lathe, specializing in small parts such as screws. It is impossible to cut these small things with a large tool, and the auxiliary time for changing work is long. After launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, Wang Zhengyong always thought: it only takes thirty seconds to make a screw, and it takes six seconds to stop the machine every time the work is changed. This is a waste of working hours. In addition, because the work is small and the number of changes is large, the "coupling piece" that controls the machine's operation heats up, affecting the machine's ability to increase its speed. How can the auxiliary time be shortened and the efficiency of the machine be improved? Wang Zhengyong never forgot this matter even in his dreams.
    Later, he remembered that on another machine he operated in the past, there was a "brake." As long as it was switched, the machine would stop quickly. Therefore, he planned to install one on the hexagonal lathe as well. His idea was immediately supported by the director of the workshop.
    After this "brake" was installed on the hexagonal lathe, the rapidly rotating machine stopped in two seconds with a light lift of the "brake," saving four seconds compared to the past. Because of the "brake," the "coupling piece" no longer heats up. In this way, in February, Wang Zhengyong kept the machine speed up to 1,400 revolutions without stopping the machine, which increased production efficiency by four times; the quality of the screws also met the standards.

### 走在增产节约运动的前面

    走在增产节约运动的前面
    编者按　2月份只有二十八天，又逢春节，是一年中生产时间最短，完成国家计划比较困难的一个月。现在传来了一些先进工人和单位提前完成计划的消息，这无疑是增产节约运动中令人鼓舞的消息。他们这种完成国家计划的坚强决心和克服困难的积极精神，是值得学习的。
    打响第一炮
    今年1月份超额为国家生产五千七百多吨钢的鞍钢第一炼钢厂，在2月份的二十四天中，又超计划给国家多生产了一千七百多吨钢。
    2月份，六号平炉的炼钢工人们打响了第一炮，他们已经提前四天完成了2月份的国家计划。在一号、二号两座姊妹平炉上，炼钢工人们展开热烈的友谊竞赛。一号平炉的工人在2月份的二十四天，用快速炼钢的方法，炼出了六十七炉钢，二号平炉的工人们冶炼每一炉钢的时间，也比国家计划缩短了很多。著名的炼钢能手一号平炉的炼钢工李尚忠告诉记者，这座平炉的炼钢工人也表示要争取提前一天到两天完成2月份的国家计划。
    锻钢工人大显身手
    这几天，太原钢铁厂锻钢车间巨大的厂房里，三部汽锤不停息地锤打着血红的钢锭。提前七天完成了2月份生产计划的锻钢工人们，正在信心百倍地为全月多生产五百二十吨钢材而劳动着。
    2月份，锻钢车间的职工们都各显身手地投入了增产节约运动。九个生产小组在2月的前三周便超额1％到20％以上完成了生产任务，产品质量也有进一步的提高。
    袁文龙工程师和老工人刘二苟、陶朋、辛效春等经过集体研究，在这一个月对锻钢的工艺规程作了重大修改——把原来的“两火锻造”改为“联合一火操作”。这种改变使钢锭开胚以后，不再经过加热就锻成成品，这使每吨钢材减少十五公斤氧化铁皮的损失，节约一百二十公斤原煤，钢材的内部和外部质量也有了显著提高。
    一切为了多出煤
    京西矿务局的矿工提前四天完成了2月份采煤计划。今年2月份，矿工们采的煤比解放后任何一年的2月份都多。1日到24日的采煤量比去年2月份全月还多三分之一。
    门头沟矿生产五组生产准备会议过去是在井下掌子面上开，开会往往要占去一、二十分钟的生产时间。2月份他们把生产准备会议挪到井上利用工余时间开。这样，不仅充分利用了工时，并且大家在下井前就知道今天干什么活，一到掌子面，就从容顺利地进行生产。这个组因此连创两个新纪录。
    城子矿掘进八组的矿工下井作了一个循环后，常常得窝工等煤车。2月上旬，班长张士清就领导大家想办法。大家想起过去岩石掘进组曾经采取的两次拉槽工作方法，它比现在使用的“一次拉槽”作一个循环的时间虽多三分之一，可是掘进进尺也要多三分之一，这样就可避免等车的窝工时间。推行这个方法后，这个组提前十二天完成了2月份的生产计划。
    在严寒的克拉玛依
    20日清晨，当太阳冲破迷蒙的晨雾，在戈壁滩上刚刚升起的时候，克拉玛依二二五号钻井队的早班工人们结束了一夜紧张的劳动。他们每个人身上都披上了一副明晃晃的泥浆冰的铠甲，但是内衣却被汗浸透了。他们个个都很高兴，说说笑笑，没有一丝倦意。原来就在他们这个班上，提前完成了全队七百公尺的月进尺计划，并且还超额了三十二公尺。
    渭北煤田上的钻工
    24日早晨八点钟，渭北煤田铜川矿区漫天大雪，宋凤岐钻机的班长左武廷和四个钻工冒雪接班以后，钻机长宋凤岐走近纪录员郭家有，纪录员拨拨算盘说：“现在，我们已钻了一百七十公尺。”宋凤岐补充说：“这比我们2月份计划多钻了二点五公尺。”
    谈话声顿时被“咯咯”的柴油机声淹没了。这时正是钻井工人们最紧张的时刻。五个钻工都围着钻机，各就其位地配合得像一个整体。眼光机警的左武廷握着“升降把”，眼神集中地注视着整体的操作。爬在二层井塔上的钻工陈泽文，正同蹲在机旁的钻工张俊廷配合动作，把一根根钻杆搬给起重机吊起来，副班长邢清海和钻工齐东盼接着把钻杆紧接起来。左武廷眼看一接好，就动一下“升降把”，让钻杆一节节地送到井孔里去。不到一个钟头，四十五根钻杆就在井里提上又放进了。随着左武廷喊了声：“加油！”邢清海已压上“给进把”。柴油机急吼着喷出一股黑烟，钻杆在顺利地超额钻进了。
    月月超额，步步提高
    重庆水轮机厂先进生产者、老工人王民庆，在17日就完成了2月份的生产计划。到24日，他已经超额完成计划70％以上，工作质量全部符合规格。
    王民庆在2月份担负这个厂里的水轮机盖和空气压缩机的机架等主件的划线工作。按照过去规定，划水轮机盖等主件的工作必须是在一个专设的平台上进行。可是，今年这个厂所生产的水轮机比过去生产的大，单是一个机盖就有三吨多重，而厂里担负起吊水轮机盖上平台的设备只有一吨半的能力。眼看水轮机盖不能上平台，影响划线的工作。王民庆在2月初就设法把在平台上划线创造性地改为在厂房工地上划线，不但解决了设备的难题，还省掉了机盖上平台的工时。
    王民庆从去年到现在一直没有出过废品，月月提前完成生产任务，在去年四个季度都被评为厂的先进生产者。
    征服“难关”
    天津市锻压机床厂的青年工人王政永提前五天多超额18％完成了2月份的工作量。
    这位早在去年12月就提前一年多完成第一个五年计划工作量的五级车工，操纵着一台六角车床，专做螺丝等小零件。做这些小东西没法吃大刀，换活的辅助时间又多。在开展增产节约运动以后，王政永总在想：做一个螺丝才三十秒钟，每换一次活停机床就要六秒钟，这样太浪费工时，另外由于活小换活次数多，使得控制机器运转的“结合片”发热，影响机器提高转数。怎样才能使辅助时间缩短、提高机器效率呢？王政永连作梦都没有忘记这件事。
    后来，想起过去操纵的另一个机器上，有一个“闸”，只要一扳，机器很快地就停下来。于是，他打算也在六角车床安一个，他的想法立即得到了车间主任的支持。
    这个“闸”安装在六角车床上以后，轻轻地把“闸”一提，飞快转动的机器在两秒钟内就停了下来，比过去省了四秒钟。由于用了“闸”，“结合片”再也不发热了。这样，在2月份王政永一直把机器的转数提高到一千四百转没有停过车，使生产效率提高四倍；螺丝的质量也都合乎标准。
