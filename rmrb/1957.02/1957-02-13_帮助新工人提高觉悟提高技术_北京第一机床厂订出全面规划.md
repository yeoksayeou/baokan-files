Xinhua News Agency, February 12th—The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant recently decided to adopt various effective methods to strengthen political and ideological education for new workers and help them become workers with a high degree of awareness.

More than 900 new workers joined the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant in 1956, accounting for more than 50% of the total number of production workers. According to a survey by the plant's Party organization, after some new workers entered the factory, they were consistently active in production, respected their teachers, observed discipline, and made rapid progress in all aspects. Their technical learning scores were above four points. Nearly 400 new workers were already able to operate independently, of which 131 joined the Communist Youth League, and 27 were selected as outstanding apprentices.

According to the survey, the situation of most new workers in the plant is: they can do production work and learn from their masters, but they are sometimes enthusiastic and sometimes lukewarm, restless, and lack the idea of taking the plant as their home and the spirit of hard work. These new workers can be transformed after patient education and assistance, but they lack the foundation of high awareness, and their progress is not sustained.

A small number of new workers perform poorly in production, have very poor discipline, do not respect their masters, do not obey the leadership, are often late or absent, and there are even individual workers with depraved morals and illegal and undisciplined behavior.

Based on the above situation, the Party Committee of Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant believes that systematically conducting communist education for new workers is an urgent task and has formulated a comprehensive plan for educating new workers throughout the plant this year. According to the plan, the plant will educate new workers with a combination of phased off-the-job study at the workers' school and after-school education. The content of the workers' school will be political education, and 150 new workers will participate in the first phase of study. In addition, in addition to the regular political and ideological education conducted by the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations for new workers, the plant will also focus on educating new workers through various activities such as reports by advanced figures, forums for new and old workers, visits, and movie screenings, and will constantly commend good people and good deeds, and launch a "competition for outstanding apprentices" so that new workers can establish the idea of learning from the advanced through comparison of the old and new, and comparison of good and bad.

The plant's plan for educating new workers specifically points out that the master's education of apprentices is an important method. The plant's experience proves that many older workers have a high level of awareness and perform very well in production. Old workers not only teach new workers technology, but also conduct regular and meticulous political and ideological work for new workers, which is very effective. The plant plans to educate older workers to play an exemplary role in production and be fully responsible for their apprentices, not only helping them learn technology, but also helping them learn politics, and helping new workers grow into workers with both skills and awareness.

### 帮助新工人提高觉悟提高技术  北京第一机床厂订出全面规划

    帮助新工人提高觉悟提高技术
    北京第一机床厂订出全面规划
    据新华社12日讯　中共北京第一机床厂委员会最近决定要采取各种有效的方法，来加强对新工人进行政治思想教育，帮助他们作一个具有高度觉悟的工人。
    北京第一机床厂1956年进厂工作的新工人有九百多人，占生产工人总数的50％以上。据这个厂的党组织调查，有一部分新工人进厂以后，在生产上一贯积极，尊师守纪，各方面的进步都很快，技术学习的成绩在四分以上，有将近四百个新工人已经能独立进行操作，其中有一百三十一人加入了青年团，并且有二十七人被评选为优秀的学徒。
    根据调查，这个厂多数新工人的情况是：生产能够干，能够向师傅学习，但是时冷时热，不安心，缺乏以厂为家的思想和埋头苦干的精神。这些新工人经过耐心教育和帮助后都能够转变，但是缺乏高度觉悟的基础，进步不能持久。
    有一部分新工人，生产不好，纪律性很差，不尊敬师傅，不服从领导，经常迟到、旷工，甚至有个别工人道德品质败坏，违法乱纪的情况也有。
    北京第一机床厂党委根据以上这些情况，认为对新工人系统地进行共产主义教育是一个迫切的任务，并且订出了全厂今年教育新工人的全面规划。根据规划，这个厂将以分期脱产进职工学校学习和业余教育相结合的方针对新工人进行教育。职工学校将以政治教育为内容，第一期将有一百五十个新工人参加学习。此外，这个厂除了由党、工会、青年团组织向新工人进行经常性的政治思想教育以外，还将着重通过先进人物报告会、新老工人座谈会、参观、看电影等各种活动来对新工人进行教育，并且不断表扬好人好事，发动“优秀学徒工”的竞赛，使新工人通过新旧对比、好坏对比，树立起向先进看齐的思想。
    这个厂在新工人教育工作规划中，特别提出师傅教育徒弟是一个重要的方法。这个厂的经验证明，很多比较老的工人觉悟很高，生产很好，老工人不但教给新工人技术，而且还对新工人进行经常的细致的政治思想工作，收效很大。这个厂准备教育比较老的工人，使他们在生产中起模范作用，对徒弟全面负责，不仅帮助徒弟学习技术，而且要帮助徒弟学习政治，帮助新工人成长为一个有技术有觉悟的工人。
