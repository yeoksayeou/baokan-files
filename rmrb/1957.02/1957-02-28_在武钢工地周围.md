Around the Construction Site of Wuhan Iron and Steel
　　By our correspondent Cao Baoming

    The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has only been under construction for over a year, but a new urban area with 90,000 city residents has already formed nearby.

    Here, not only are hundreds of vehicles, thousands of tons of barges, and thousands of stevedores working day and night transporting and loading and unloading building materials and daily necessities, but also, almost every construction site and every neighborhood has sky-blue kiosks or temporary stalls made of reed mats, supplying workers with daily necessities. Some larger construction sites also have post offices, banks, department stores, and cooperative canteens specializing in breakfast. On both sides of the main road in "Workers' Village," where workers are concentrated, in addition to the large department stores of the Department Store, Bookstore, and Handicraft Production Cooperative Joint Society, there are also large restaurants, hotels, barbershops, photo studios, cinemas, and theaters, as well as many inconspicuous but essential grain stations, coal shops, vegetable markets, tailor shops, dry cleaners, and general stores selling pots, bowls, and pans, as well as various handicraft production cooperatives for shoe repair, watch repair, and bicycle repair.

    At six or seven o'clock in the evening, "Workers' Village" becomes lively. The salespeople in these stores are busy serving the many customers. The cinema is showing the latest films from the city. The famous Chu opera actress Guan Shaobin is performing for the workers in the theater. …

    Before August 1955, this was still a barren hill, with only a few hundred workers scattered around dozens of miles doing site exploration and surveying. At this time, three comrades from the department store, carrying a box of daily necessities with flashlights, rushed to set up a supply point here overnight; eleven comrades from the cultural center also carried erhus, gongs and drums, and book boxes to carry out recreational activities here.

    When the 670 houses in "Workers' Village" were built at the end of 1955, and tens of thousands of workers began to enter the construction site, the relevant units in Wuhan City were mobilized to send people from various districts to set up more supply points here. Li Guizhu, an old chef from Mianyang Restaurant, recalled: "At that time, it was really tense. We only heard the relocation mobilization report on December 25th, and we had to start cooking here on New Year's Day. We started moving on the 29th, with pots, pans, bowls, chopsticks, tables, and benches filling a large boat, and we didn't finish moving until two or three o'clock in the morning. There was only an empty house here, with nothing. Everyone immediately split up to set up stoves and go to the city to buy goods. We finally opened on time on New Year's Day. After opening, there was a shortage of water here. Usually, we could hire horse-drawn carts to drag water from five or six miles away, but when it snowed heavily, the roads were so slippery that the horse-drawn carts couldn't go. How could such a large restaurant operate without water? Everyone went step by step to carry well water from two miles away to cook and make rice. As a result, our supply was not interrupted for a single day."

    When more than 30,000 workers all entered the construction site last year, the supply of daily necessities here suddenly became tense again. People had to queue to buy things, queue to take public buses, and even stand in long queues to buy fried dough sticks, go to restaurants, and watch movies. Sometimes, because the variety of goods was incomplete, people couldn't buy what they wanted even after standing in line for a long time. The movies were also blurry and unclear due to poor screening technology, and often broke down, often taking three hours to watch a show.

    At this time, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China urgently convened a meeting of responsible party member cadres from relevant bureaus to specifically study the issue of supporting Wuhan Iron and Steel, reiterating that the support work must be "active and proactive, handled first, only allowed to be done well, not allowed to be done badly." The deputy director of the Finance, Grain, and Trade Office of the Municipal People's Committee, together with the director of the Commerce Bureau and managers of various companies, came here to inspect the work. The District People's Committee also convened meetings of workers' families by area to solicit opinions.

    Too few supply points were the main reason for the serious queuing phenomenon at that time. Twenty-six relevant units in the city immediately transferred forces from the city to set up 322 large and small stores, stalls, and 24 handicraft production cooperatives here, with a total of more than 3,000 staff members. The coal shop also implemented the method of "selling tickets door-to-door and delivering goods to the door."

    If there were too few varieties of goods, the department store would organize salespeople from the new urban area stores to visit the central department stores in the city. When they saw new varieties and good colors, they would immediately ask the city for goods. As a result, their goods increased from 2,800 kinds to 6,800 kinds.

    The staff of each store also made a pact to correct their service attitude. Retail stores with a wide variety of goods proposed to do: "Ask one, take two, introduce three, so that customers come happily and return satisfied." Vegetable market salespeople used to be afraid that unsold vegetables would rot and cause losses, so they insisted on selling them together with popular vegetables, causing resentment among housewives. Now, they have implemented "grading and pricing," "allowing selection, never pairing." The catering industry used to be annoyed when customers urged them again and again when they were too busy. They demanded that they "have a better attitude the busier they are." Since November last year, the Mianyang Restaurant has received 842 written commendations from customers in 70 days.

    In order to solve the transportation problem of the workers here, Wuhan City had a total of 176 public buses and 13 ferries, and 14 buses and 2 ferries were fixed here for regular transportation. On Saturday afternoons and Sundays, the number of public buses here increased to 25, and the ships were changed to only carry passengers and not transport goods.

    In order to solve the cultural life problems of the workers, the Cultural Bureau sent cadres to help projectionists improve their skills, and at the same time designated the cinemas here as first-class cinemas, so that the four cinemas and three projection teams here could regularly screen first-run films. They also organized famous Han opera troupes, Chu opera troupes, and Peking opera troupes in the city to perform here regularly. Cadres from the Cultural Center also held seven training courses here successively, including accordion playing, theatrical makeup, and library management, held sixteen literary lectures, and assisted the construction site in establishing more than 30 clubs and 40 amateur cultural and recreational organizations, including drama troupes, bands, song and dance teams, and creation groups. More than 90 teams have been organized.

    Because all relevant parties, within possible conditions, gave play to the spirit of being active and proactive, and tried their best to solve the livelihood problems of the workers at the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site. At one time, palm beds were in short supply in Wuhan City, but the Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative Joint Society tried to ensure that palm beds were supplied here continuously. It took one or two months to sew a set of clothes in the city, but the sewing cooperative tried to ensure that the workers here could wear warm new cotton clothes within seventeen or eight days. There was a shortage of rubber boots in the city, so the manager of the Municipal Department Store personally went to Tianjin to handle a batch of rubber boots and first transferred 5,000 pairs to here.

    Because the staff of the commercial department paid attention to carrying out work according to the characteristics of the workers on this construction site, workers from other places were able to live as if they were in their hometowns. There are many northern workers here, with large hands and feet, so the department store specially transferred many large-size gloves and shoes. Northern workers like to eat dumplings and stir-fried dishes, so the retail company and the vegetable company supplied a large number of dried shrimps, day lily, wood ear, and leeks for making dumplings and stir-fried dishes before each festival... The catering company also tried to maintain the characteristics of the "three steams" (steamed chicken, steamed meat, steamed meatballs) of Mianyang Restaurant, the "burnt three pastes" of Jiefang Canteen, and the Shanxi knife-cut noodles and Henan dumplings of Chunheji, in order to meet the needs of workers from all over the country. The comrades of Xinhua Bookstore also supplied books at any time according to the progress of the project. When the thermal power plant started installing machines, they supplied books related to electricity; recently, the factory area in front of the plant is building the factory buildings of several auxiliary workshops, and they supplied a large number of books related to steel structure, welding, and hoisting. In the fourth quarter of last year, they sold 200,900 books, worth more than 58,000 yuan.

    In order to let the workers spend this year's Spring Festival happily, the vegetable company here timely prepared more than 30 kinds of fresh vegetables, about 1.3 million catties, including Shandong's fat green onions and Guangzhou's green peppers and eggplants; the retail company prepared 980,000 catties of more than 1,000 kinds of goods, including Sichuan cured meat, Shandong frozen chicken, etc. Mianyang Restaurant also added New Year's cake and yuanxiao. In terms of cultural and recreational activities, in addition to the theater troupes in the city performing here, the workers' amateur Peking opera troupes and Chu opera troupes also scheduled performances to various construction sites from January 24.

    Of course, because the population here is increasing rapidly and the demand for materials is very large, the workers at the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site still have many difficulties in life. The relevant departments in Wuhan City are also studying how to gradually improve the lives of the workers here based on the principle of "spending less money and doing more things."

    在武钢工地周围
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉钢铁公司才兴工一年多，附近便形成了一个拥有九万城市居民的新市区。
    在这里，不仅有数百辆汽车、几千吨驳船和几千名搬运工人在日夜运输和装卸建筑材料、日用百货，同时，几乎每个工地、每道街坊，都设有天蓝色的售货亭或用芦席搭成的临时小店，供应职工生活必需品。一些较大的工地上，还设有邮局、银行、百货商店和专卖早点的合作食堂。在职工集中的“工人村”的大马路两旁，除了百货、图书和手工业生产合作社联合社的大门市部以外，还有大型的餐馆、旅社、理发厅、照相馆、电影院和戏院，另外还有许多不惹人注意但在生活中不可缺少的粮站、煤店、菜场、缝衣店、洗染店和出售锅碗瓢盆的日用杂品商店，以及补鞋、修表、修理自行车的各种手工业生产合作社。
    一到夜晚六、七点钟，“工人村”就热闹起来了。这些商店的营业员都忙碌地接待着众多的顾客。电影院里放映着市里新到的首轮影片。楚剧名演员关哨彬在戏院里为职工演出。……
    在1955年8月以前，这里还是一片荒丘，只有几百名工人分散在周围几十里的地方做厂址钻探和测量工作。这时候，百货公司就有三个同志打着手电筒，抬着一箱日用品，连夜赶来在这里设立了供应点；文化馆也有十一个同志背着胡琴、锣鼓、书箱，到这里来开展文娱活动。
    当“工人村”的六百七十栋房屋在1955年年底修建起来，成千上万的工人开始进入工地的时候，武汉市各有关单位都紧张地动员起来，从各区抽人到这里来增设供应点。沔阳饭店的李贵柱老厨师回忆说：“当时真紧张得很。我们在12月25日才听了搬家的动员报告，元旦就要在这边开火。我们29日开始搬，锅盆碗盏、桌凳一大船，搬到深夜两三点钟才搬完。这边就只有一座空房子，要啥没啥，大家马上又分头安锅灶，上市里办货，到底在元旦准时开张了。开张以后，这里缺水，平常还能雇到马车去五、六里以外拖水，一下大雪，路上滑的马车不能走。这么大的餐馆没有水怎么能营业呢？大伙就一步一滑地到两里路以外去挑井水来做菜，做饭。结果我们的供应没有中断一天。”
    当三万多名职工在去年全部进入工地以后，这里的生活供应工作又骤然紧张起来了。买东西要排队，搭公共汽车要排队，甚至买油条、上餐馆、看电影也要站很长的队。有时候，因为货物的花色品种不全，在站了很久的队以后，还买不到自己想要的东西。电影也因为放映技术不高，模糊不清，时常断片，往往要花上三个钟头才能看完一场。
    就在这时候，中共武汉市委连夜召集有关各局党员负责干部开会，专门研究了支援武钢的问题，重申了支援工作必须“积极主动，尽先办理，只准办好，不许办坏”的方针。市人民委员会财粮贸办公室副主任同商业局长和各公司经理一起到这里检查工作。区人民委员会也分片召集职工家属开会，征求意见。
    供应点太少，是造成当时排队现象严重的主要原因。全市二十六个有关单位马上又从市内抽调力量，在这里设立了三百二十二个大小商店、摊亭和二十四个手工业生产合作社，共有三千多名工作人员。煤店还实行了“挨户售票，送货上门”的办法。
    花色品种太少，百货公司就组织新市区商店营业员到市内中心门市部参观，见到有什么新品种、好花色，马上就向市里要货。结果他们的货物由二千八百种增加到六千八百种。
    各店的工作人员也订出公约，端正服务态度。货物品种繁杂的零售商店提出要作到：“问一拿二介绍三，使顾客高兴而来，满意而归”。菜场营业员过去总怕滞销菜腐烂了受损失，硬要同畅销菜搭配着一起卖，引起主妇们的反感，现在已实行了“分等论价”，“任凭挑选，绝不搭配”。饮食业过去在生意忙不过来的时候，顾客们一催再催，服务员就烦了，他们便要求自己做到“工作越忙，态度越好”。沔阳饭店从去年11月以来，七十天中就受到顾客八百四十二次书面表扬。
    为了解决这里职工的交通问题，武汉全市总共有一百七十六辆公共汽车和十三条轮渡，就固定了十四辆汽车和两条轮渡经常在这里运输。一到星期六下午和星期日，这里的公共汽车增加为二十五辆，轮船也改为只载乘客不运货。
    为了解决职工文化生活问题，文化局派了干部来帮助放映员提高技术，同时将这里的电影院列为甲等影院，使这里的四座电影院和三个放映队能够经常放映首轮影片。他们还组织市内著名的汉剧团、楚剧团和京剧团经常到这里演出。文化馆的干部也在这里先后举办了手风琴演奏、戏剧化妆和图书管理等七个训练班，举办了十六次文艺讲座，并且协助工地成立了三十多个俱乐部、四十多个业余文娱组织，有剧团、乐队、歌舞队和创作小组等。球队已经组织起九十多个。
    由于各有关方面在可能的条件下，发挥积极主动的精神，尽量设法解决武钢工地的职工生活问题。有个时期，武汉市内的棕床脱销，市手工业生产合作社联合社却设法使这里的棕床源源供应。在市里缝一套衣服要等一两个月的时间，缝纫合作社却设法使这里的职工在十七、八天内就能穿上暖和的新棉衣。市里的胶靴很缺，市百货公司经理就亲自到天津办了一批胶靴回来，首先调给这里五千双。
    由于商业部门的职工注意根据这个工地上职工的特点开展工作，外地来的职工能够像在家乡一样地生活。这里，北方工人多，手大脚大，百货公司就特地调来了很多大尺码的手套和鞋子。北方工人喜欢吃饺子和炒菜，零售公司和蔬菜公司在每个节日之前，都大批供应做饺子和炒菜用的虾皮、黄花、木耳和韭菜……。饮食公司还想法保持了沔阳饭店的“三蒸”（蒸鸡、蒸肉、蒸元子）、解放食堂的“烧三糊”、春合记的山西刀削面和河南水饺的特点，以适应从全国各地来的职工的要求。新华书店的同志们也随时根据工程的进展情况供应书籍。热电厂开始安装机器了，就供应有关电气的书；最近厂前区正在修建几个辅助车间的厂房，他们便大量供应有关钢结构、电焊和吊装的书。在去年第四季度里，他们就销售了二十万零九千册书，值五万八千多元。
    为了让职工们欢度今年的春节，这里的蔬菜公司及时地准备了三十多种、约一百三十万斤鲜菜，有山东的肥大葱和广州的青椒、茄子等；零售公司准备了九十八万斤、一千多种货物，其中有四川腊肉，山东冻鸡，等等。沔阳饭店也增加了年糕和元宵。在文娱活动方面，除市内的剧团到这里演出以外，职工们的业余京剧团和楚剧团也从1月24日起就排满了到各工地演出的节目。
    当然，因为这里人口增加很快，物资需要量很大，武钢工地上的职工在生活方面还有不少困难。武汉市有关方面也正在研究根据“少花钱，多办事”的原则，使这里的职工生活逐步改善。
