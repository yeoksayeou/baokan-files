    China's First Giant Transformer is Born
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 17th) On February 16th, the Shenyang Transformer Factory successfully trial-produced China's first giant power transformer with a capacity of 40,500 kVA and a voltage of 154 kV. This transformer has a three-winding structure, weighs 152 tons, is 7.4 meters high, and has an installation area of 46 square meters. It stands like a two-story building in the high-voltage test station of the factory's assembly workshop.
    This giant power transformer is the largest one designed and trial-produced independently in China's first Five-Year Plan. It is specially designed for long-distance power transmission in large power stations, reducing voltage and supplying industrial electricity to more than ten large machine manufacturing plants. This type of transformer is called a "three-phase transformer" because it can exert the same effect as a group of three single-phase transformers with a capacity of 13,500 kVA and a voltage of 154 kV each. However, compared with a group of three single-phase 13,500 kVA transformers, it can save 30% of materials and requires a smaller installation area, making it particularly suitable for the current needs of industrial production in China.
    When the Shenyang Transformer Factory accepted the task of trial-producing this giant transformer, the designers referred to the design data of a Soviet 20,000 kVA, 154 kV single-phase transformer, adopted China's design and production experience of three-phase transformers, and actually understood the situation of China's power transmission system. At the beginning of the design, the designers proposed to achieve zero-error design and completely avoid rework. The workers also proposed that not only should the quality of this transformer meet the specifications, but it should also reach the standard of excellent products. Now, the designers and workers have fulfilled their promises and completed this task one month ahead of schedule.
    On February 16th, the factory conducted the final test of the transformer. To verify its pressure resistance, it had to undergo overvoltage and induced voltage tests exceeding twice its own voltage. During the test of this new product, the designers and workers came to the control console. The bell rang, and a voltage of 320,000 volts was quickly sent to the new transformer. People invariably watched the instruments on the control console, which steadily indicated the normal operation. A few minutes later, the transformer passed the test and was officially declared born.

    我国第一台巨型变压器诞生
    本报沈阳17日电　2月16日，沈阳变压器厂试制成功了我国第一台四万零五百仟伏安、十五万四千伏电压的巨型电力变压器。这台变压器是三线卷的结构型式，重一百五十二吨、高七公尺四十公分、安装面积四十六平方公尺，像一幢两层楼的房屋矗立在厂内装配车间高压试验站内。
    这台巨型电力变压器是我国第一个五年计划中自行设计试制的最大的一台。它是专供大型发电站中距离输电、把电压降低和供应十个以上的大型机器制造厂工业用电使用的。这种变压器叫做“三相变压器”，因为它能发挥三个一万三千五百仟伏安、十五万四千伏电压的单相变压器组的同等效能。但是它和三台单相一万三千五百仟伏安变压器组比较起来，材料可以节约30％，安装面积也较三台小，特别适合我国目前工业生产的需要。
    沈阳变压器厂接受试制这台巨型变压器的任务的时候，设计人员曾经参考了苏联二万仟伏安、十五万四千伏电压的单相变压器设计资料，采用了我国三相变压器设计的生产经验，并且实际了解了我国电力输电系统的情况。开始设计的时候，设计人员就提出要在无错误设计中，完全做到不返工；工人们在试制中，也纷纷提出不仅要使这台变压器质量合乎规格，而且还要达到优良品的标准。现在，设计人员和工人们都实现了自己的诺言，而且提前一个月完成了这项任务。
    2月16日，工厂最后试验了这台变压器。为了证实它的耐压力，它要经受超过本身二倍以上的外施高压和感应高压试验。在这个新产品试验的时候，设计人员和工人来到了控制台。电铃响了，三十二万伏的电压很快地送到了这个新的变压器里。人们不约而同地注视着控制台上的仪表，它一直平稳地指示着运转的正常。几分钟后，这台变压器通过了考验，正式宣告诞生。
