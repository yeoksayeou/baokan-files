Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 24th: Mao Yingji, a physician at the First People's Hospital of Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, has been trialing the use of oral antimony agents to treat patients with early and late-stage schistosomiasis, with efficacy comparable to the currently widely used antimony injection therapy. According to the preliminary results of treating 223 cases in this hospital over the past ten months, the cure rate reached 66.7%.

At the second meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Schistosomiasis Research Committee, which closed on the 22nd, experts, professors, and doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine unanimously agreed that this method is simple and easy to implement, inexpensive (costing only one-fifth of the three-day antimony injection therapy), has few side effects, and allows for door-to-door delivery of medication. If further trials are successful, it will indeed be a good method for treating schistosomiasis in rural areas.

The meeting believes that the possibility of the oral antimony agent trial being successful is very high, and preparations are being made to conduct trials using the same specifications of the preparation in hospitals in Shaoxing, Hangzhou, Jiangshan, Qu County, Jiaxing, and other places, so as to reach a conclusion as soon as possible.

    试用口服锑剂治疗血吸虫病
    据新华社杭州24日电　浙江省金华市第一医院医师毛应骥，试用口服锑剂治疗早、晚期血吸虫病患者，疗效和目前普遍使用的锑剂注射疗法相同。根据这个医院十个月来治疗二百二十三个病例的初步效果，治愈率达到66.7％。
    在22日闭幕的浙江省血吸虫病研究委员会第二次会议上，到会的专家、教授、中西医师们一致认为这个方法简单易行、花钱少（费用只占锑剂三日疗法的五分之一）、反应少，并且可以送药上门。如果进一步试验成功，确是目前农村治疗血吸虫病的好方法。
    会议认为口服锑剂试验成功的可能性很大，准备用同一规格的制剂在绍兴、杭州、江山、衢县、嘉兴等地医院进行试验，以便及早得出结论。
