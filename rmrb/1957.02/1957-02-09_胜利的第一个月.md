    The First Month of Victory	Li Qian
    On the last working day of January, I visited the Northwest Third State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory.
    As soon as I entered this factory, I was drawn in by the intense and enthusiastic atmosphere of labor. In the weaving workshop, the weavers were quickly and accurately inspecting the fabric surfaces around the twenty-four looms they were responsible for; the weft changers pushed small carts to add weft yarn to each loom; the oilers, cleaners, and assistant foremen were also walking back and forth between the loom passages, some oiling the looms, some removing cotton fluff, and some inspecting the machines. The distance between each loom was not large, and workers of many types were shuttling back and forth to do their work, but the order was maintained, and there was no confusion.
    The workshop director excitedly told me that the weaving workshop, like the entire factory, had already overfulfilled the January production plan across the board. The percentage of first-grade plain cloth had reached 97.52%, and the percentage of first-grade twill cloth had reached 96.66%. This workshop also changed the situation of failing to complete the yarn consumption plan last year, using one kilogram less yarn per thousand meters of cloth than planned, which had never happened before. Then, he said: The quality of the weaving workshop is not only a reflection of the quality situation of this workshop, because if the front spinning and fine spinning workshops cannot spin good yarn, the quality of the cloth will not improve! This month, the standard rate of the medium-count yarn they supplied has reached 100%.
    It has been two Spring Festivals since the Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 officially went into production. In the past, every Spring Festival, many workers were busy buying things to prepare to go home for the Spring Festival, and they were not focused on their work. Weaving workers often let substandard cloth pass, and weft changers often dropped the shuttles outside the shuttle box, causing mechanical accidents. Therefore, the completion of various plans in January each year was not as good as usual, and many cadres regarded the Spring Festival as a hurdle. Now, the situation is different. The workers have proposed to enter the last year of the first Five-Year Plan with a new attitude.
    This new attitude is reflected in all aspects. Every worker in the workshop regards every job in the workshop as their own job. If someone has a problem at work or in life, everyone helps to find the cause and think of a solution. For example, weaver Du Guizhen often produced substandard cloth last year. Cui Xiuqin carefully observed her operation and found that the reason for her substandard cloth was that she did not bend over during operation, handled stops slowly, and could not grasp the patrol time. So, she told her her experience of not producing substandard cloth for several months. After get off work every day, she asked her if she had produced substandard cloth, and helped her find the cause of the substandard cloth. Du Guizhen was very touched. She examined the root cause of her excessive substandard cloth production, and realized that unfocused thinking was an important reason in addition to technical problems. From then on, she wrote the slogans "Concentrate Thinking" and "Prevent Substandard Cloth" on the loom to warn herself at all times. In this way, she did not produce a single piece of substandard cloth in January.
    At about 3:30 in the afternoon, I saw that the workers who had not yet left the factory from the first two shifts were preparing for the shutdown. As soon as the machine stopped, everyone ran to the machine, swept away the dust on the machine, padded the parts of the machine that were prone to rust with paper, and wiped them clean.

    胜利的第一个月	李茜
    在1月份的最后一个劳动日，我访问了国营西北第三棉纺织厂。
    一走进这个工厂，我就被紧张热烈的劳动气氛吸引住了。在织布车间里，值车工人们都在自己负责的二十四台布机旁边迅速准确地巡回检查布面；换纬工推着小车子给每台布机上增添纬纱；加油工、清洁工和副工长们也都在布机的弄档间走来走去，有的给布机加油，有的在清除棉花毛，有的在检查机器。每个布机之间距离不大，很多工种的工人又都在这里穿梭似地进行工作，秩序井然，没有一点儿忙乱现象。
    车间主任兴奋地告诉我，织布车间像全厂一样，已经全面超额完成了1月份的生产计划。平布的上等品率已经达到97.52％，斜纹布的上等品率达到96.66％。这个车间还改变了去年完不成用纱量计划的情况，每千公尺布比计划少用一公斤纱，这是过去从来没有过的事情。接着，他又说：织布车间的质量好坏，不仅是表现这一个车间的质量情况，因为前纺和细纱等车间如果纺不出好纱，布的质量也不会提高呀！这个月，他们供给的中支纱，标准品率已经达到100％了。
    西北国棉三厂正式投入生产以来，已经过了两个春节了。过去，每到春节，不少工人就忙着买东西准备回家过春节，工作的时候思想不集中，织布工人往往把次布放过去，换纬工往往把梭子掉在梭箱外边，造成机械事故，所以每年1月份的各项计划完成得都不如平常好，很多干部都把春节当成一关。现在，情况不同了，工人们提出以新的姿态进入第一个五年计划的最后一年。
    这种新的姿态表现在各个方面。车间的每一个工人，把车间里的每一种工作都看成自己的工作，有一个人工作上或生活上发生问题，大家都帮助找原因，想办法。例如，织布工杜桂珍去年经常出次布，崔秀琴注意观察了她的操作情况，发现她出次布的原因是操作时不弯腰，处理停台慢，不能掌握巡回时间，于是就把自己几个月不出次布的经验告诉她。每天下班以后，都问她出了次布没有，并且帮助她找出了出次布的原因。杜桂珍很受感动，她检查了自己出次布多的根由，不光是技术问题，思想不集中也是个重要原因。从此，她在布机上写上“思想集中”，“防止次布”的口号，时时警惕自己。就这样，1月份她没有出一匹次布。
    在下午三点半钟左右，我看到前两班还没有离厂回家的工人都在做关车前的准备工作。刚刚停车，大家就跑到机器旁边，扫除机器上的灰尘，把机器上容易生锈的部分用纸垫起来，把它擦得亮亮的。
