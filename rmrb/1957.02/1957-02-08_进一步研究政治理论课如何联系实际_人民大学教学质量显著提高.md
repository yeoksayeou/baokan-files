Xinhua News Agency report by Xinhua News Agency reporter Ding Baofang: Judging from the results of the final exams, the teaching quality of Renmin University of China has improved significantly this semester.

    The outstanding impression students give when answering exam questions is their ability to fully elaborate and apply principles in connection with reality. Some students in the Journalism Department were able to profoundly connect and illustrate with their familiar professional knowledge when answering questions on form and content in philosophy class. Many students were also able to link their majors to current academic debates and offer their own views and opinions on various schools of thought. Among the 235 first-year students in the Journalism Department who took the philosophy exam, 130 received excellent grades and 88 received good grades.

    Renmin University of China's improvement of teaching quality starts from the fundamentals. All departments in the university have made the writing of lecture notes closely integrated with China's reality the primary task. According to statistics from the finance and economics departments alone, 130 teachers with strong professional skills and rich teaching experience have left or semi-left production to specialize in writing lecture notes. In the past, the lecture note systems for many courses such as industrial economics, enterprise organization and planning, agricultural economics, and criminal law, were often focused on introducing the situation in the Soviet Union. Even when some Chinese realities were mentioned, they were often used to illustrate the Soviet situation. Now, the lecture notes written by the teachers have been reformed in terms of the system, with China's reality and characteristics as the main content. To enrich the content of the lecture notes, more teachers have gone into practice for further studies or social investigations this semester than in any previous period. Currently, out of more than 90 courses in the university, more than 60 courses have basically achieved the pre-class distribution of lecture notes, enabling students to have conditions to think about problems.

    Teachers not only can closely integrate with China's situation and characteristics when lecturing, but also pay attention to the development of the international situation, and emphasize the connection with current academic debates in their lectures. They pay attention to inspiring and guiding students to study and think in all aspects of teaching.

    The content and methods of examinations have also been greatly improved. Outside of class, teachers pay more attention to understanding students' difficulties in learning than in the past, and actively help them with self-study.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Renmin University of China discussed the issue of how to connect political theory classes with reality at a recent meeting of the Academic Committee.

    Since November of last year, the Department of Political Theory Education of the Ministry of Higher Education has organized teachers of political theory courses from nine universities across the country and Renmin University of China to form a working group to systematically summarize the teaching experience of the four political theory teaching and research sections of Renmin University of China.

    The preliminary summary affirms the efforts made by the teachers of political theory courses at Renmin University of China in implementing the principle of integrating theory with practice in recent years, and the achievements are the main aspect. In teaching, they generally pay attention to connecting with the Party's policies and major issues in political and economic life. In classroom discussions, topics that integrate theory with practice have gradually increased. When writing teaching outlines or teaching materials for various courses, they can reflect China's situation and characteristics, and also pay attention to inducing teachers to study issues of practical significance to national construction in scientific research work.

    The inspection also revealed that there is still a certain degree of dogmatism in political theory teaching at Renmin University of China. The conceptualization, generalization, and abstraction of some teachers when explaining principles is a common problem in lecturing. In the inspection process, many teachers criticized the idea of treating individual principles and formulas in Marxism as immutable dogmas. This idea manifests itself in teaching as objectivism when publicizing foreign experiences, disregarding time, place, conditions, and the rich experience and actual conditions of the Chinese revolution, applying them mechanically, and not being good at using the principles of Marxism-Leninism to explain the reality of the Chinese revolution. Some teachers neglect to use Marxism-Leninism as a methodological ideological weapon to transform the subjective world of students, which is a serious shortcoming in teaching.

    There is also a tendency of dogmatism in scientific research work, mainly manifested in the fact that some scientific research topics and papers are generally empty talk, not starting from summarizing a large amount of practical materials, but from theory to theory, and some papers quote extensively but lack analysis.

    Renmin University of China proposes that the teaching content of the foundation of Marxism-Leninism will be fundamentally changed through the revision of the teaching syllabus. The principle of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" will be implemented in teaching ideology. In the future, when conducting systematic theoretical teaching, the spirit of the teaching content should be considered. For issues that are easily blurred and have practical significance among students, attention should be paid to key teaching, and close integration with reality should be maintained in all aspects of teaching such as classroom discussions, tutoring, and examinations.

    进一步研究政治理论课如何联系实际
    人民大学教学质量显著提高
    据新华社讯　新华社记者丁宝芳报道：从期终考试的结果看来，中国人民大学这一学期教学质量有了显著的提高。
    学生们在考场上回答考题时，给人的突出印象是能够联系实际充分阐述和运用原理。新闻系有的学生在回答哲学课上关于形式和内容的试题时，能够深刻地联系自己所熟悉的专业知识，加以阐述和引证。还有很多学生能就自己的专业联系当前学术界正在争论的问题，提出自己对各学派的看法和见解。新闻系二百三十五个参加哲学课考试的一年级学生中，得到优等成绩的有一百三十人；成绩良好的八十八人。
    中国人民大学提高教学质量是从根本上着手的。全校各专业都把编写密切结合中国实际的讲义列为首要任务。仅据财经各专业统计，就有一百三十名有较强业务能力和丰富教学经验的教师脱离生产或半脱离生产，专门编写讲义。过去，工业经济企业组织与计划、农业经济和刑法等很多课程的讲义体系都偏重于介绍苏联的情况，即使联系中国的一些实际也往往只是去引证说明苏联的情况。现在教师们编写的讲义从体系上作了改革，以中国的实际和特点为主要内容。为了丰富讲义的内容，这学期轮流深入实际进修或作社会调查的教师比往年任何时期都多。现在全校九十多门课程，有六十多门课程基本上做到课前发讲义，使学生们有条件思考问题。
    教师们不单在讲课时能密切结合中国情况和特点，同时也注意联系国际形势的发展，并且强调在讲课中联系当前学术界正在争论的问题。他们在各个教学环节都注意启发诱导学生钻研思考。
    考试的内容和方法也有了很大的改进。在课外，教师们比过去更加注意了解学生学习中的困难，主动地帮助他们自学。
    据新华社讯　中国人民大学在最近举行的一次学术委员会会议上讨论了政治理论课如何联系实际的问题。
    从去年11月起，高等教育部政治理论教育司组织全国九个高等学校和中国人民大学的政治理论课教师成立工作组，系统总结中国人民大学四门政治理论课教研室的教学经验。
    初步总结肯定了几年来中国人民大学政治理论课教师在贯彻理论联系实际方面的努力，成绩是主要的。在讲授中一般能注意联系党的政策和政治、经济生活中的重大问题，课堂讨论中已经逐渐增加了理论联系实际的题目，在编写各门课程的教学大纲或教材讲义时，能反映中国的情况和特点，也注意在科学研究工作中诱导教师研究对国家建设有现实意义的问题。
    从检查中也暴露出中国人民大学政治理论教学还有一定程度的教条主义的倾向。有些教师在讲解原理时的概念化、一般化和抽象化是讲课中的一个通病。在检查过程中，不少教师批判了把马克思主义中的个别原理、公式看作一成不变的教义的思想。这种思想表现在教学上，就是宣传外国经验时的客观主义，不考虑时间、地点、条件和中国革命实践中的丰富经验和实际情况而生搬硬套，不善于运用马克思列宁主义的原理来说明中国革命的实际。一些教师忽视把马克思列宁主义作为一种方法论的思想武器来改造学生的主观世界，这是教学中的一个严重缺点。
    在科学研究工作中也存在着教条主义倾向，主要表现是有些科学研究的选题和论文泛泛空谈，不是从总结大量实际材料出发，而是从理论到理论，有些论文连篇引证而缺乏分析。
    中国人民大学提出，马克思列宁主义基础的教学内容，将通过教学大纲的修订，从根本上改变。在教学思想上贯彻百家争鸣的方针。今后在进行系统的理论教学时，应考虑讲授内容的精神实质，对学生中易于模糊和带有现实意义的问题，注意重点讲授，并在课堂讨论、辅导和考试等各个教学环节中密切联系实际。
