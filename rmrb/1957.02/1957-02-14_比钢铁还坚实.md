    More Solid Than Steel
    Guang Xin, Lu Wei

    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we cannot help but think of the Soviet experts who have worked tirelessly to help our country develop its metallurgical industry.

    In recent years, China's metallurgical industry has developed at an astonishing rate. In 1957, China's steel production is planned to reach 4.12 million tons, an increase of 25 times compared with 1949 (158,000 tons). When the country was founded in 1949, China had almost no non-ferrous metallurgical industry. In these short few years, new blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and rolling mills have been put into production, and new metallurgical enterprises and mining enterprises have been built or are under construction. Now China's metallurgical industry has been initially established. The achievements made in China's metallurgical industry are inseparable from the generous and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, and from the fraternal help of thousands of Soviet experts.

    When Anshan was first liberated in 1948, Angang, China's only large-scale iron and steel complex, was completely destroyed by Japanese imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionary government. At that time, the Japanese imperialists, who were hostile to us, mocked and said: "Let the Chinese grow sorghum here." However, on this ruin, China's first automated large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel pipe plant, and automated seventh blast furnace have long been put into production, and a large amount of steel is produced to support national economic construction. This is the result of the friendship established and the joint creative labor of metallurgical workers from China and the Soviet Union in their heroic labor.

    We will never forget the selfless enthusiasm and responsibility shown by the Soviet experts who helped our country build the metallurgical industry in their work.

    Steelmaking expert Comrade Malyshev came to China twice to help with his work. He has been to many steel plants, personally guiding steelmaking beside the high-temperature open hearth furnace, and has trained many steelmaking workers in the Tianjin Steel Plant and the Chongqing Steel Plant. Ironmaking expert Comrade Okolkov personally went into the hot air duct to guide the work during the overhaul of a blast furnace in Angang. When he was in Beijing, whenever the blast furnace in Shijingshan experienced hanging charges or nodules, he always went to the scene in person to help, whether it was day or night.

    The non-ferrous metallurgical Soviet experts currently working in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry regularly go to factories and mines across the country to impart new technologies and advanced experience. The experts who are building non-ferrous metal mines in the Northwest have very harsh living conditions. They live in earthen houses and, in addition to working during the day, they also take turns working night shifts in the mines every day, working day and night with Chinese mine workers. They take pride in helping the Chinese people with construction.

    The design workers of the Leningrad Branch of the Soviet Black Metallurgy Design Institute have helped our country compile the designs of many iron and steel enterprises. Here, we cannot help but think of Comrade Sidorov, the chief engineer of the Soviet Black Metallurgy Design Institute, who also came to China twice to help us build the steel industry. The first time was from 1949 to 1952, and the second time was from 1954 to 1956. One of his legs was injured in the Great Patriotic War, but he still traveled tirelessly to all the iron and steel enterprises in China, making valuable contributions to the development of China's iron and steel industry. After returning to his country, he still kept Chinese friends in mind. He wrote us a meaningful letter during the New Year this year, saying: "We are helping Chinese friends build new blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces and rolling mills with joy." "The Soviet experts who work in China are proud to be able to contribute their strength to China's industrialization and the consolidation of the friendship between our two peoples." This is the feeling of all Soviet experts.

    On this great day of the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we recall a few fragments of Sino-Soviet friendship, and we cannot help but deeply thank the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Soviet metallurgical workers, and we cannot help but feel the warmth and strength of friendship. This friendship of ours is an eternal friendship generated by the people of the two countries for a common ideal, in a common struggle and labor, and consolidated by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. People often describe this friendship as "deeper than the ocean and stronger than a rock." We metallurgical workers feel from our own experience that this friendship is more solid than steel. It is not afraid of the erosion of wind and rain, nor is it afraid of the attacks of various evil forces. It is like a special high-quality steel. May this steel-like friendship be further consolidated and developed.

    比钢铁还坚实
    光昕　芦苇
    在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订七周年的日子里，使我们不能不想起那些不辞劳苦帮助我国发展冶金工业的苏联专家们。
    几年来，我国的冶金工业以惊人的速度发展着。1957年我国钢的产量按计划将达到四百一十二万吨，比1949年（十五万八千吨）增加了二十五倍。1949年建国的时候，我国几乎没有什么有色冶金工业，在这短短的几年中，一座座新的高炉、平炉、轧钢机投入生产了，一个个新的冶金企业和矿山企业建成或正在建设着。现在我国的冶金工业已经初步建立起来了。中国冶金工业中所获得的成就是与伟大苏联的慷慨无私的援助分不开的，也是和上千个苏联专家兄弟般的帮助分不开的。
    1948年鞍山刚解放的时候，鞍钢这个我国唯一的大型钢铁联合企业，被日本帝国主义者和国民党反动政府破坏无遗。当时敌视我们的日本帝国主义者嘲笑说：“让中国人在这里种高粱吧。”但是，就在这个废墟上我国第一个自动化的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和自动化的七高炉早已投入生产，并且生产大量的钢铁支援国家经济建设。这正是中苏两国冶金工作者在英勇劳动中建立起来的友谊和共同创造性劳动的结果。
    帮助我国建设冶金工业的苏联专家们，在工作中所表现的忘我的劳动热情和负责精神，是我们永远不会忘记的。
    炼钢专家马立舍夫同志曾两次来中国帮助工作，他到过许多炼钢厂，在高温的平炉旁亲自指导炼钢，并在天津钢厂和重庆钢厂中培养了许多炼钢工作者。炼铁专家奥柯尔柯夫同志在鞍钢某高炉大修时亲自钻到热风管指导工作。他在北京时，每逢石景山的高炉发生挂料或结瘤时，无论是白天或黑夜总是亲临现场帮助工作。
    目前在冶金工业部工作的有色冶金苏联专家们，经常地到全国各地厂矿传授新技术和先进经验。在西北建设有色金属矿山的专家们，生活条件很艰苦，他们住在土房里，除了白天工作而外，每天还轮流到矿山值夜班，和中国矿山工作者共同夜以继日地工作着。他们以帮助中国人民进行建设而引为光荣。
    苏联黑色冶金设计院列宁格勒分院的设计工作者们帮助我国编制了许多钢铁企业的设计。在这里，我们不能不想到苏联黑色冶金设计院总工程师希多洛夫同志，他也曾两次来中国帮助我们建设钢铁工业。第一次是1949年——1952年，第二次是在1954年——1956年。他的一只腿在卫国战争中负伤了，可是仍不辞辛苦地走遍了中国所有的钢铁企业，对中国钢铁工业的发展做出了可贵的贡献。他回国以后，对中国朋友仍然念念不忘，今年新年时候给我们写了一封意味深长的信，信中说：“我们怀着愉快的心情帮助中国朋友建造新的高炉、平炉和轧钢机。”“我们在中国工作的苏联专家则以自己能够为中国实现工业化和巩固我们两国人民的友谊事业中贡献自己的力量而感到骄傲。”这正是所有苏联专家的心情。
    在这中苏友好同盟互助条约签订七周年的伟大日子里，我们回忆了中苏友谊中的几个片断，不能不深深地感谢苏联人民、苏联政府和苏联的冶金工作者，不能不感到友谊的温暖和力量。我们这种友谊是两国人民为着一致的理想，在共同斗争和劳动中产生，为中苏友好同盟互助条约所巩固的永世的友谊。人们往往把这种友谊形容为“比海洋还深，比磐石还坚”，我们冶金工作者们从自身的体会中感到这种友谊比钢铁还坚实，它既不怕风雨的浸蚀，也不怕各种恶势力的袭击，它好像一块特殊的优质钢。愿这种钢铁般的友谊更加巩固和发展。
