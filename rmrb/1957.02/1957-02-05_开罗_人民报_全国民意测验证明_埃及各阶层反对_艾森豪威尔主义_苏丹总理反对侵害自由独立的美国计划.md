Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 4th: "People's News" reported on the 3rd that, to date, in the nationwide poll regarding the Eisenhower Doctrine, only three people have expressed approval, while 68,342 people have expressed opposition. Those who oppose the Eisenhower Doctrine believe that this doctrine will harm Egypt's interests.

The percentages of people from various strata of society participating in this poll are as follows:

	Students and professors 45%, workers and freelancers 25%, officials and clerks 20%, others including housewives and military personnel and other various occupations 10%.

Some nationals of other Arab countries residing in Egypt also participated in this survey.

This poll, which was initiated by the Egyptian "People's News," began two weeks ago.

Xinhua News Agency, February 4th: TASS, Cairo, February 3rd, reported: According to the Middle East News Agency, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdullah Khalil, when talking about the "Eisenhower Doctrine," said that Sudan opposes any program that infringes on Sudan's freedom and independence.

Sudanese Minister of Local Autonomy Mohammed Noureddine told a reporter from the Cairo "Evening News": "No country that desires freedom would approve of the so-called vacuum theory in the Eisenhower Doctrine. From what I understand, this theory means replacing the influence of Britain and France in the Middle East with the power of another country." Noureddine said that this theory has been condemned by all Arab people.

Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, February 3rd: The Afghan "Reform News" published an editorial on January 30th, refuting the American argument of filling the Middle East "vacuum."

The editorial pointed out that colonialists entered Asian countries dressed as merchants, but after the Second World War, the people of Asia awakened and are fighting to regain everything they lost in the past centuries.

The newspaper also pointed out that in order to fill this "vacuum," imperialists are trying to win over relevant countries. According to the new American policy, it not only attempts to fill the "vacuum" in Asia, but also attempts to fill the "vacuum" in Africa.

    开罗“人民报”全国民意测验证明
    埃及各阶层反对“艾森豪威尔主义”
    苏丹总理反对侵害自由独立的美国计划
    新华社开罗4日电　“人民报”3日报道，到目前为止，在关于艾森豪威尔主义的全国性的民意测验中，只有三个人表示赞成，有六万八千三百四十二人表示反对。反对艾森豪威尔主义的人认为，这个主义会损害埃及的利益。
    参加这次民意测验的各阶层人士的百分比数如下：
    学生和教授45％，工人和自由职业者25％，官员和职员20％，其他包括家庭主妇和军事人员等各种职业的人10％。
    居住在埃及的其他阿拉伯国家的国民也有一些人参加了这次测验。
    这次民意测验在两星期前开始，是由埃及“人民报”主持的。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社开罗3日讯：据中东通讯社报道，苏丹总理阿卜杜拉·哈利勒在谈到“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候说，苏丹反对任何侵害苏丹的自由和独立的纲领。
    苏丹地方自治部长穆罕默德·努赛丁对开罗“晚报”记者发表谈话说：“没有一个希望自由的国家会赞成艾森豪威尔主义中所谓的真空理论。据我的了解，这个理论意味着，用另一个国家的势力来替换英、法两国在中东的势力。”努赛丁说，这种理论遭到全阿拉伯人民的谴责。
    新华社喀布尔3日电　阿富汗“革新报”1月30日发表社论，驳斥美国所谓填补中东“真空”的论调。
    社论指出，殖民主义者穿着商人的服装进入了亚洲国家，但是在第二次世界大战以后，亚洲人民觉醒了，并且正在为收回他们在过去几世纪中失去的一切进行着斗争。
    这家报纸还指出，为了想填补这个“真空”，帝国主义者正在设法拉拢有关国家。按照美国的新政策，它不但企图填补亚洲的“真空”，而且还企图填补非洲的“真空”。
