In 1956, especially in the first half of the year, the work of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas developed greatly and achieved great results. However, the current actual situation of the work of eliminating illiteracy is not satisfactory. As of December 1956, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei and other provinces generally completed only 50% of the enrollment tasks; in some areas, the number of enrolled students accounted for only about 10% of the original plan, or even did not start school; in many areas, the number of enrolled students was far less than before the autumn harvest last year. This is a very abnormal phenomenon.

Last year, the autumn harvest in many places was late, and some places suffered from disasters to varying degrees. Winter production, especially sideline production, was high, coupled with heavy other work tasks. These situations affected the development of the work of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas. More importantly, some places did not incorporate the work of eliminating illiteracy into the overall arrangement of rural winter work. Therefore, under the heavy rural work, the progress of the work of eliminating illiteracy was extremely difficult.

Due to the relaxation of leadership, the publicity work for eliminating illiteracy in winter was very poor, and the enthusiasm of the masses for learning was not fully mobilized. At the same time, there was a lack of investigation and research before the winter school began, and there were no specific measures to adapt to the new situation when arranging work. For example, whether and how people engaged in sideline production can learn, which areas can be organized for learning in areas with poor harvests or disasters, and which areas cannot be organized for learning have not been well studied, and no appropriate measures have been proposed, so that many people who could have learned did not participate in learning. Due to the relaxation of leadership, some specific problems in the masses' learning have not been solved in time. For example, in some places in Shanxi Province, most of the classrooms of people's schools were used as warehouses. In the Tai'an area of Shandong Province, the problem of lost work by many teachers has not been resolved, and teaching is not reassuring. In Yangshan County, Guangdong Province, almost all the people's schools are concentrated learning, and other organizational forms such as group learning are not adopted, so that the masses who are engaged in sideline production and live in scattered areas cannot enroll.

It is a fact that rural work tasks are heavy. This is a normal situation. It is impossible to imagine eliminating illiteracy in rural areas when they are in a state of leisure. Since this is the case, the work of eliminating illiteracy should be carried out with a positive attitude and appropriate methods. However, after correcting the shortcomings of overly high and urgent planning in the work of eliminating illiteracy last summer, some cadres relaxed the work of eliminating illiteracy. We must resolutely oppose blindly carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy regardless of the conditions; we must also resolutely oppose adopting a negative attitude towards the work of eliminating illiteracy. We advocate that the work of eliminating illiteracy should be carried out actively and steadily under the principles of not affecting production, not affecting the health of the masses, and not forcing orders. To achieve this, the key lies in rationally arranging the spare time of the masses and adopting different learning forms suitable for the needs of the masses for different objects. The learning time should be arranged appropriately, and the gaps in production should be used as much as possible. In order to prevent forced orders, it is necessary to carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization to inspire the enthusiasm and consciousness of the masses for learning, and should not regard preventing blind advancement as an excuse for negative slackness.

The unified leadership of party committees and governments at all levels and the support of agricultural cooperatives play a major role in the development of the work of eliminating illiteracy. This requires party committees and governments at all levels to promptly determine the plans and tasks for eliminating illiteracy, make appropriate arrangements for the work of eliminating illiteracy when arranging various tasks in rural areas, and conduct supervision and inspection to help solve some major problems. As for daily work, it should rely on educational administrative departments, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the anti-illiteracy associations and other organizations at all levels, as well as activists among the broad masses. Facts have proved that doing so will not involve much power from party and government leaders and agricultural cooperative leaders. For example, when the Xinjing County Committee of the Communist Party of China focused its main efforts on agricultural cooperation in the winter of 1955, it also planned the work of eliminating illiteracy, made arrangements through the party representative meeting, and assigned special personnel to lead the work of eliminating illiteracy, and major problems could be studied and resolved in a timely manner. After the transformation into advanced cooperatives, the work in the cooperatives was very busy, and learning may be squeezed out. At this time, the county party committee made unified arrangements for production, meetings, and learning time. This ensured the smooth progress of the work of eliminating illiteracy.

Now the Spring Festival is over, and the busy farming season is about to begin. All localities should conduct an inspection of the current work of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas. All places where the work of eliminating illiteracy has been relaxed should strengthen leadership and make unified arrangements and deployments for the work of eliminating illiteracy and spring rural production. The organizational forms of learning should be diversified, and people engaged in sideline production should also be actively organized to learn as much as possible. All localities should mobilize the vast number of literate people in rural areas to participate in teaching work, and these teachers should be avoided from delaying their production as much as possible. If work is delayed due to teaching, appropriate subsidies should be given under the principle of running the society diligently and thriftily. Specific issues such as funding and classrooms for mass learning should be resolved in a timely manner.

Eliminating illiteracy is an arduous historical task. We should continue to mobilize the broad masses to participate in literacy learning on the basis of the work in 1956, and correct the current phenomenon of slackness in the work of eliminating illiteracy. This phenomenon of leadership slackness also exists in factories, mines, and urban streets. Therefore, the work of eliminating illiteracy for cadres, workers, and citizens must also be inspected. All localities should take effective measures to improve teaching quality, consolidate learning results, and make preparations for leading year-round learning ideologically and in work, so as to better complete this year's task of eliminating illiteracy.

### 扫除文盲工作不能松懈

    扫除文盲工作不能松懈
    1956年，尤其是上半年，农村扫除文盲工作有了很大的发展，也取得了很大的成绩。但是，目前扫除文盲工作的实际情况是不能令人满意的。辽宁、山东、山西、湖北等省截至1956年12月止，一般只完成了入学任务的50％；有的地区入学人数只占原计划的10％左右，甚至没有开学；不少地区入学人数远不及去年秋收以前。这是一种很不正常的现象。
    去年许多地方秋收较晚，有些地方有不同程度的灾害，冬季生产，特别是副业生产较多，再加上其他工作任务繁重，这些情况都影响农村扫除文盲工作的开展。更重要的是有一些地方在安排农村冬季工作中没有把扫除文盲工作统一安排进去，因此，在农村工作繁重的情况下，扫除文盲工作的进展极为困难。
    由于放松了领导，冬季的扫除文盲宣传工作做的很差，群众学习的积极性没有充分地发动起来。同时，在冬季开学以前缺少调查研究，在布置工作的时候缺乏适应新情况的具体办法。例如，对于参加副业生产的人能不能学习和如何学习，对于歉收或受灾的地方有哪些可以组织学习，有哪些不可能组织学习等等情况，都没有很好地研究，也没有提出适当的办法，以致有不少可以学习的人没能参加学习。由于放松了领导，群众学习中的若干具体问题也没有得到及时的解决。例如，山西省有些地方大部分民校教室被当作仓库用。山东省泰安专区许多教师误工问题没有解决，教学不安心。广东省阳山县的民校几乎全是集中学习，没有采用小组学习等其他组织形式，以致搞副业生产的和居住较分散的群众不能入学。
    农村工作任务繁重是事实。这是一种通常情况。不可能设想在农村处于一种清闲状态的时候再来扫除文盲。既然如此，就应该用积极的态度、采取适当的办法开展扫除文盲工作。但是从去年夏季纠正扫除文盲工作中规划偏高偏急的缺点以后，有些干部对于扫除文盲工作就松懈了。我们要坚决反对不看条件地盲目地进行扫除文盲的工作；我们同样要坚决反对采取消极的态度来对待扫除文盲的工作。我们主张扫除文盲的工作应当在不影响生产、不影响群众健康、不强迫命令的原则下积极地稳步地进行。要做到这一点，关键就在于合理地安排群众业余时间和针对不同对象采取不同的适合群众需要的学习形式，学习时间要安排的适当，尽量利用生产的空隙。为了防止强迫命令，必须进行深入的宣传动员，启发群众学习的积极性和自觉性，而不应该把防止盲目冒进当作消极松懈的借口。
    各级党和政府的统一领导和农业合作社的支持，对于扫除文盲工作的开展起着重大的作用。这就要求各级党和政府及时地确定扫除文盲的规划和任务，在布置农村的各种工作的时候把扫除文盲工作也作适当的安排，并且进行督促检查，帮助解决某些重大的问题。至于日常工作，应该依靠各级教育行政部门、青年团、妇联、扫除文盲协会等组织以及广大群众中的积极分子去做。事实证明，这样做，并不会牵扯党政领导和农业社领导上的多大力量。例如，中共山西省新绛县委会在1955年冬季，以主要力量搞农业合作化的时候，把扫除文盲工作也规划进去，通过党代表会议作了布置，并责成专人领导扫除文盲的工作，重大问题都能及时研究解决。转为高级社以后，合作社里工作很忙，学习有被挤掉的可能，这时候县委又把生产、会议和学习时间做了统一的安排。这样就保证了扫除文盲工作的顺利进行。
    现在春节已过，农忙季节快要开始。各地应该对当前农村扫除文盲工作进行一次检查。凡是扫除文盲工作松懈了的地方，应当加强领导，把扫除文盲工作和春季农村生产作统一的安排和布置。学习的组织形式要多样化，对于参加副业生产的人，在可能范围内也要积极地组织他们学习。各地要发动广大农村识字的人参加教学工作，对这些教师应尽量避免耽误他们的生产。如果因教学误了工，要在勤俭办社的原则下采取适当的办法给以适当的补助。对于群众学习的经费、教室等具体问题应该及时加以解决。
    扫除文盲是一项艰巨的历史任务。我们应当在1956年工作的基础上，继续发动广大群众参加识字学习，纠正目前扫除文盲工作的松懈现象。这种领导松懈的现象，在工厂、矿山、城市街道中也有。因此，对干部、职工、市民的扫盲工作也必须进行检查。各地要采取有效措施，提高教学质量，巩固学习成绩，并且在思想上和工作上做好领导常年学习的准备，更好地完成今年的扫除文盲的任务。
