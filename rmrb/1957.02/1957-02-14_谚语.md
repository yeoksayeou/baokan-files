    Proverbs
    Prepare in leisure for times of need; digging a well when thirsty is too late.
    Money is dead treasure, strength is living treasure; dead treasure is not as good as living treasure.
    One pole is easy to bend, but three strands of hemp rope are hard to break.
    Save an ounce or two of grain each day, and in ten years you'll fill a granary.
    Looking at people through a crack in the door - seeing them as insignificant.
    The palest ink is better than the best memory.
    It is better to teach children than to accumulate wealth; it is better to read books than to sit idly.
    Saving rice ensures food to eat; saving cloth ensures clothes to wear.
    In bumper years, don't forget the hardships of lean years; when full, don't forget the suffering of hunger.
