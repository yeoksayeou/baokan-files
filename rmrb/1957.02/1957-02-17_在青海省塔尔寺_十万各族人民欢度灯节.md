Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 16th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Liben reports: Approximately 100,000 people of Tibetan, Han, Tu, Hui, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups gathered at the Ta'er Monastery in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province—the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Yellow Sect—on the evening of the 14th to joyfully celebrate the Lantern Festival.

On the night of the Lantern Festival, the moonlight was clear and bright. The people crowded on the hillsides and in the monastery greeted each other and exchanged well wishes in various ethnic languages. When thousands of butter lamps were lit in the square to the right of the Great Golden Tile Temple, illuminating two towering, multi-tiered butter flower displays over six zhang high, the crystal-clear moon seemed to pale in comparison. Yellow canopies floated above the butter flower displays, and countless silk banners embroidered with Buddha images rose on all sides. The two butter flower displays were sculpted by the Upper Flower Courtyard and Lower Flower Courtyard of the Ta'er Monastery. According to custom, the two courtyards kept their techniques secret from each other during sculpting, each wanting to surpass the other with extraordinary craftsmanship. Amidst the melodious Buddhist music, the Upper Flower Courtyard's butter flower panels were hoisted onto the flower frame by ropes, drawing exclamations of admiration from the gazing crowds. The butter flowers depicted not only vivid flowers, birds, and animals, and Buddha images of varying sizes and expressions, and magnificent pavilions and palaces, but also statues of Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni standing on Tiananmen Square. The Lower Flower Courtyard's butter flowers also won the praise of their competitors and the people. The butter flowers depicted religious stories, with the top layer portraying the scene of Chairman Mao, the Dalai Lama, and the Panchen Erdeni joyfully celebrating the Tibetan Wood Sheep New Year together, flanked by flower plaques in Tibetan and Chinese: "Great Unity of All Nationalities."

Both courtyards' butter flowers incorporated new content this year.

In the days leading up to the Lantern Festival, people of all ethnic groups from Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Gansu, Sichuan, and Qinghai had been continuously gathering at the Ta'er Monastery. Some came with their entire families, and a village of tents with rising smoke formed on the hillsides surrounding the monastery.

During the Lantern Festival, the government allocated additional transportation vehicles to facilitate the travel of people of all ethnic groups coming to view the lanterns and pay homage. Commercial departments also held a materials exchange conference, selling agricultural and pastoral production tools and daily necessities worth 237,700 yuan to farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups from the 12th to the 14th, and also purchasing a large quantity of hides, wool, and other local specialties from them.

    在青海省塔尔寺
    十万各族人民欢度灯节
    新华社西宁16日电　新华社记者杨立本报道：十万左右的藏、汉、土、回、蒙古等族人民，14日晚聚集在青海省湟中县的塔尔寺——黄教创始人宗喀巴的诞生地欢度灯节。
    灯节之夜，月色清朗，拥挤在山坡上和寺院里的人们用各种民族语言互相祝贺问好。当大金瓦寺右侧的广场上燃起几千盏酥油灯，照耀着两架六丈多高的层层叠叠的酥油花的时候，晶莹的月亮似乎也黯然失色。酥油花架上面飘动着黄罗盖伞，四边升起无数面绣着佛像的绸缎屏幡。两架酥油花是塔尔寺的上花院和下花院塑造的。根据习惯，两院在塑造时互相保守秘密，都想用出奇的手艺赛过对方。在悠扬的佛乐声中，上花院的酥油花分幅用吊绳绞上花架了，翘首观望的群众啧啧赞赏。酥油花上不仅塑造着生动的花卉鸟兽，神态不同的大小佛像，壮丽的楼阁宫殿，还有毛主席和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼站在天安门上的塑像。下花院的酥油花也赢得了竞赛对方和人们的赞赏，酥油花上塑造着宗教故事，最上一层是毛主席和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼一起欢度藏历木羊年新年时的情景，两旁还有藏文和汉文的花匾：“各民族大团结”。
    两院的酥油花今年都增加了新的内容。
    灯节的前几天，来自内蒙古、西藏、甘肃、四川和青海各地的各族人民就陆续向塔尔寺汇集，有的全家都来了，寺院周围的山坡上形成了一座座炊烟缭绕的帐篷村落。
    政府在灯节期间增拨许多交通车辆，便利观灯和朝拜的各族人民来往。商业部门还举办了物资交流大会，从12日到14日共销售了二十三万七千多元的农牧业生产工具和生活用品给各族农牧民，还向他们收购了大批皮张羊毛等土特产品。
