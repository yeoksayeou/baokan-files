　　The Camel Team of Karamay
　　Tao Xingeeng

　　For several nights, when I was sound asleep, I was often awakened by a crisp ringing sound. Once, filled with curiosity, I sat up in bed and peered out through the frost-covered window. Snowflakes were falling from the sky, and the wind was blowing hard. On the road not far from the window, I could vaguely see a camel team, with several herders bending over, slowly leading the camels past.

　　Where did this camel team come from in this sparsely populated Karamay oil field area?

　　By chance, I met Zhai Fubin, the person in charge of this camel team, in the office of the Mining Bureau Director. He told me that this camel team was specially organized by herders from Emin, Tuoli and other counties to support the construction of Karamay. Karamay has very few transport vehicles. When the government mobilized the herders to organize camel teams to participate in transport work, many herders came to sign up from far-off mountain gullies; elderly herders, unable to participate in the transport team, insisted on sending their camels to the team. More and more people joined the camel team. By the end of last year, there were already 469 camels, and in January of this year, more than 1,500 camels joined the transportation effort. With so many people in the camel team, there were not enough houses to live in, so they brought their tents, yurts, and cooking stoves. The camel team often had to set off in the middle of the night to fetch firewood from places more than 20 kilometers away from their residence, and they would spend the night on the Gobi Desert by lighting a few bonfires. The winter in Karamay is very cold; even sleeping in a heated house, one would still be awakened by the cold at night, so spending the night in the open air was, of course, even colder. But in order to support the construction of Karamay, the herders overcame the severe cold of minus forty degrees, working day and night.

　　The camel team has solved many difficulties for the Karamay oil field area. In the past, firewood had to be transported by trucks, and materials also had to be transported by trucks, but there were very few trucks, so the firewood for cooking and heating for the workers was often not guaranteed. Since the arrival of the camel team, the firewood piles in the coal yard have been getting higher and higher.

　　One night, when I passed by the coal yard, I saw a camel team coming from afar, led by Bai Kesilun, the captain of the camel team. When he came closer, I firmly shook his hand and said, "You've worked hard!" He shrugged and said, "It's nothing!" At that moment, I felt that the cracks on his hands seemed to be longer than before. I asked him, "How much firewood did you fetch this time?" He said, "More than 1,500 kilograms. An average of more than 200 kilograms per camel." I felt a little strange, so I asked, "Didn't a camel only carry more than 100 kilograms in the past?" He said, "That was in the past. Now other teams are catching up, and if we don't work harder, we will fall behind." At this moment, a smile appeared on his weathered face.

    克拉玛依的骆驼队
    陶鑫耕
    有几天夜晚，当我正熟睡的时候，常常被一种清脆的铃声惊醒。有一次，我怀着好奇心，从床上坐起来，拨开窗上的霜花向外望去。天上正飘着雪花，风刮得很紧。在窗外不远的公路上，隐隐约约地有一支骆驼队，几个牧民弯着腰，赶着骆驼缓缓地走了过去。
    在这人烟稀少的克拉玛依油田区，哪里来的骆驼队啊？
    一个偶然的机会，我在矿务局局长办公室里，遇见了这个骆驼队的负责人——翟福彬。他告诉我，这个骆驼队是额敏、托里等县的牧民专门组织了来支援克拉玛依建设的。克拉玛依的运输车辆很少。当政府动员牧民组织骆驼队参加运输工作的时候，很多牧民都从老远的山沟里赶来报名；上了岁数的老牧民，不能参加运输队，也坚持要把自己的骆驼送到队里来。参加骆驼队的人，一天比一天多，到去年年底已经有四百六十九峰骆驼，今年1月份又有一千五百多峰骆驼参加运输。骆驼队人多，房子不够住，他们就把帐篷、蒙古包和锅灶一起带来。骆驼队常常要在半夜出发，到距离住地二十公里以外的地方去打柴，夜晚就在戈壁滩上燃起几堆篝火过夜。克拉玛依的冬天很冷，就是睡在生火的屋子里，晚上也要被冻醒，在露天地里过夜，当然就更冷了。但是牧民们为了支援克拉玛依的建设，战胜了零下四十度的严寒，日日夜夜地忙碌着。
    骆驼队为克拉玛依油田区解决了不少困难。过去运柴要用汽车，运材料也要用汽车，但是，汽车又很少，职工们做饭和取暖的用柴就常常没有保障。自从有了骆驼队，煤炭场的柴堆就一天比一天高了。
    有一天晚上，我路过煤炭场的时候，远远看见走来一支骆驼队，走在最前面的是一个骆驼队的队长白克史伦。当他走到跟前的时候，我紧紧地握住他的手，说了声：“辛苦了！”他耸了耸肩说：“没什么！”就在这时候，我感觉到他手上的裂痕好像比以前更长了。我问他：“这回又打多少柴？”他说：“有一千五百多公斤。平均每峰骆驼驮两百多公斤。”我感到有些奇怪，于是问了一句：“过去一峰骆驼不是只能驮一百多公斤吗？”他说：“那是过去的事了。现在别的队都追上来了，我们再不加把劲，就要落在别人后边了。”这时候，在他那饱经风霜的脸上，露出了微笑。
