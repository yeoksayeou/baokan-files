　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: According to TASS reports: After negotiations in Paris, the Soviet Union and France signed a long-term barter agreement for three years starting this year. The long-term agreement stipulates that the volume of Soviet-French barter trade will expand year by year, and the types of exchanged goods will also be expanded. It is expected that by the end of the three-year period (1959), the trade volume between the two countries will increase by approximately two times compared to 1955.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch from Paris by TASS: The signing of the long-term trade agreement between the Soviet Union and France has caused a good reaction in the French capital. According to Agence France-Presse, French authorities believe that this agreement will enable France to obtain important raw materials that would otherwise require the payment of foreign exchange, especially US dollars. In addition, this agreement opens up new sales markets for French industry.

　　These people emphasized that the Sino-French agreement is a fruitful new contribution to the development of East-West relations. While reporting on the news of the signing of the agreement, the Paris newspapers also emphasized the great significance of this matter to France. "Liberation" pointed out that France's purchase of Soviet raw materials could save it $222 million.
