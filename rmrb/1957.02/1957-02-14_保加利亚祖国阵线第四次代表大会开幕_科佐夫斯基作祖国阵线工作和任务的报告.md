Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 12th: The Fourth Congress of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front opened in Sofia on the 11th. Zhivkov, Yugov, and others attended the congress.

The congress was opened by Chervenkov, Chairman of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front.

Kozovski, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National Council of the Fatherland Front and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Assembly, delivered a report on the work of the Fatherland Front since the Third Congress and its future tasks. He first pointed out that in the five years since the Third Congress, Bulgaria has taken a major step forward in developing its economy and culture. In 1956, industrial production increased four and a half times compared to 1939, and heavy industrial production increased nine times. The cooperative system has been thoroughly and firmly established in Bulgaria's rural areas. The people's living standards have greatly improved. In the first four years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the real wages of workers and staff have increased by more than 40%.

Kozovski said that in the past five years, the political education work and all daily activities of the Fatherland Front have been more consciously focused on further strengthening the unity of the working people around the Bulgarian Communist Party and the people's government, enhancing the people's patriotic awareness and their enthusiasm for participating in state management, strengthening the struggle to increase labor productivity and achieve agricultural harvests, encouraging and carrying out mass criticism of the shortcomings of individual state organs and social organizations, further raising the vigilance of the working people, and more extensively carrying out the struggle to defend peace and further strengthening Bulgarian-Soviet friendship. He said that the Fatherland Front's greatest achievement is that it has become an increasingly strong pillar of the people's government.

Kozovski said that in the past five years, the Fatherland Front has absorbed members of many new resident classes into its ranks. Before the Third Congress, the Fatherland Front had approximately 16,250 organizations at all levels nationwide, with 2,113,803 members. Now there are more than 37,500 organizations at all levels, with more than 2,916,000 members, accounting for approximately 58% of all voters, including 1,962,000 rural working people, accounting for 57.94% of rural voters, and women accounting for 46% of the total membership.

In his report, Kozovski pointed out some shortcomings in the work of the Fatherland Front and talked about the current tasks of the Fatherland Front. He said that the Fatherland Front should continue to work unswervingly, more fully mobilize the strength and enthusiasm of the Bulgarian people, and enable them to participate most actively in socialist construction. For this, it is necessary to conduct the most vigorous struggle against any phenomenon that underestimates the socio-political role of the Fatherland Front. He said that the most important political task of the Fatherland Front is to more extensively develop and consolidate Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, because Bulgarian-Soviet friendship is the most necessary prerequisite for us to advance along the socialist road.

The congress also heard the report of the Financial Supervisory Committee and the report of Popzlazev, member of the National Committee of the Fatherland Front, on the revision and supplement of the Fatherland Front's charter.

    科佐夫斯基说，五年来祖国阵线吸收了许多新的居民阶层的成员到自己的队伍中来。第三次代表大会前，祖国阵线在全国约有一万六千二百五十个各级组织，拥有二百一十一万三千八百零三个成员。现在各级组织共有三万七千五百多个，拥有二百九十一万六千多成员，约占全体选民的58％，其中有农村劳动人民一百九十六万二千人，占农村选民的57.94％，妇女占成员总数的46％。
