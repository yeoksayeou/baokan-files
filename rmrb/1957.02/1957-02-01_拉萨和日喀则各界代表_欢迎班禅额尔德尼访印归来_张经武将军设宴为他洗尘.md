Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 31st: Panchen Erdeni was welcomed by more than 300 representatives from all circles in Lhasa and Xigaze when he arrived at the airport near Lhasa on the morning of the 29th.

Those welcoming him included Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee; Jin Shaoshan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Pingcuo Wangjie, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region; Xiazha Se, an official of the Tibetan local government; and Dingjie Living Buddha, a representative of the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall Committee.

The acting Consul General of the Indian Consulate General in Lhasa, Cai Boer, also went to welcome him.

Panchen Erdeni reviewed the honor guard at the airport.

At the welcoming ceremony held at the airport, Fan Ming delivered a welcome speech, saying: During their visit to India, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama successfully completed various religious activities, and carried out many beneficial works to promote the international unity of Buddhists, enhance the friendship between the people of China and India, strengthen Sino-Indian cultural exchanges, and safeguard world peace. They have achieved great accomplishments. This is the glory of the Tibetan people and the glory of the people of the motherland.

Panchen Erdeni said in his reply: The Dalai Lama and I went to India last November to participate in the 2,500th Anniversary Commemoration of Sakyamuni's Nirvana. After the meeting, we visited and paid homage to various parts of India for nearly two months. This visit and pilgrimage has further strengthened the friendship between our country and India, brought us closer to and deepened our understanding of the peace-loving people of India, and enriched our knowledge of Buddhism. At the same time, it has once again given us a deeper experience of the great and correct Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's policy of freedom of religious belief. We believe that through this visit, the friendship between the people of China and India will be further developed and consolidated, and cultural exchanges and trade will become more frequent. It will not only benefit the friendship between the people of China and India, but also the friendly cooperation of the Asian people, and even more the prosperity of Buddhism and world peace.

After the meeting, Panchen Erdeni rested briefly at the airport and then took a car to Yangbajing.

Among those who arrived with Panchen Erdeni that day were his scripture teacher Enjiu Living Buddha, his father, mother, younger brother, and more than a dozen others. Yang Gongsu, the representative of the Central People's Government stationed in Tibet who was sent to India to welcome the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, also arrived on the same plane.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 31st: Panchen Erdeni arrived at Yangbajing near Lhasa by car on the afternoon of the 29th. General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, went to the area to welcome him and hosted a banquet in the evening to welcome the Panchen Erdeni back.

Representative Zhang Jingwu and Panchen Erdeni had a cordial conversation in a specially set-up yellow tent.

Yangbajing is the fork in the road from the airport to Lhasa and Xigaze. Panchen Erdeni stayed here overnight and then returned to Xigaze.
