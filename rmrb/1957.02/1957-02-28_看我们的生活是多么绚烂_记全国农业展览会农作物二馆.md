Look How Splendid Our Life Is
    ——A Record of the National Agricultural Exhibition's Crop Pavilion II
    By Our Reporter Ai Ling

    The entrance to the National Agricultural Exhibition's Crop Pavilion II is like a sea of snow-white cotton. Fluffy cotton bolls greet visitors with smiling faces. On both sides of the hall are displays of flax, hemp, silkworms, tea, flue-cured tobacco, and the lustrous linen yarn and colorful silk brocade made from these products… The golden-yellow tobacco leaves, the faintly shimmering cocoons, the multi-colored fruits and vegetables, the screen-like herbs, precious deer antlers, ginseng… all reflect and complement each other in a dazzling array. As our economic crops increase, the colors of our lives become more vibrant, and the interest in life becomes richer. The exhibits here evoke in us a love for life and respect for the laboring farmers who create them.

    The exhibition tells us that our ancestors invented sericulture and silk reeling thousands of years ago. Traditional Chinese medicine is one of the most precious heritages of our nation. Tea cultivation also has a history of more than two thousand years, and hemp and cotton have also been cultivated in our country for a long time. We truly owe a debt of gratitude to our ancestors for cultivating and spreading such a rich and diverse range of economic crops.

    Today, the tremendous achievements in economic crop production in our country in recent years, as displayed at the exhibition, can be a source of comfort to our ancestors: our generation has not failed their millennia of hard work.

    Let us first look at the achievements of cotton production in our country!

    From 1949 to 1956, the total national cotton production increased from 8.88 million dan to 31.01 million dan, and the national average yield per mu increased from 21 jin to 35 jin. In 1956, there were 17 million mu of cotton fields nationwide, each mu producing more than 50 jin of ginned cotton; among them, 3 million mu yielded 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. What a tremendous achievement!

    More than a dozen new varieties of cotton are on display here. The guide tells us that to wear good quality cloth, we must plant improved varieties of cotton. In the past, because we used degraded varieties, the yield was low, and we could only weave ordinary cloth and twill. Now, new varieties are being promoted nationwide. The cotton fibers are nearly four millimeters longer than before, and we can weave beautiful fabrics such as poplin, khaki, and gabardine. There is also a kind of fine-staple cotton for special purposes, which can be used to make cord fabric for aircraft and automobile tires, and it has now been successfully trial-planted. In 1956, the area of improved cotton varieties in our country accounted for about 90% of the total cotton field area, up from 10% in 1952.

    Cottonseeds also have many uses! On display here are some records, telephones, transparent combs, rayon, soap… all made from cottonseeds through chemical methods.

    The achievement of increased cotton production encourages people and promotes the development of the textile industry. Cotton cloth production in 1956 more than doubled that of 1949. In 1949, the national average per capita cotton cloth allocation was only 12.2 chi, but in 1956 it had increased to 28.5 chi. In the past, few people in the countryside wore new floral cloth clothes, but now, which young woman doesn't have one or two new floral cloth outfits?

    People watched with respect and admiration the pictures of large-scale high-yield cotton areas and the typical examples of high-yield experiences. The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Turpan County, Xinjiang, planted 1,800 mu of cotton. Due to the dry climate and little rainfall, the use of irrigation and the selection of "Si San Yi Qi San" and "Ba Wu Yi Qi" varieties resulted in an average yield of 109 jin of ginned cotton per mu on 1,656 mu of cotton fields, of which 20 mu yielded more than 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Other regions have also seen large-scale high-yield records in some counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives.

    In the south, there are places where they harvest a crop of cotton and then harvest a crop of grain, and they have achieved large-scale high yields for consecutive years. In Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, 52 mu of cotton fields were universally planted with green manure in addition to the implementation of general technical measures. As a result, they yielded 85 jin of ginned cotton and 120 jin of wheat per mu.

    The natural conditions of many high-yield units are not very favorable. Most of Xiajinxian County, Shandong Province, is dry land, and fertilization is ineffective, with an average yield of just over 20 jin of ginned cotton per mu. After collectivization, the farmers seized upon the local characteristics of drought and wind, strengthened drought prevention and moisture conservation, increased fertilizer application, and other measures. In 1956, 4.65 million mu of cotton fields achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 70 jin of ginned cotton per mu, 40% higher than the bumper year of 1955. There is also such a cotton-growing area, the Jinghui Canal area in Shaanxi Province (including five counties), with 420,000 mu of cotton fields, which is an ancient irrigated cotton area. Initially, the yield of dry land significantly increased with canal water irrigation; however, continuous cotton planting, little organic fertilizer application, and the use of flood irrigation led to soil alkalization, and cotton production gradually declined. In 1952, the yield of ginned cotton per mu fell to just 25 jin. Later, farmers carried out comprehensive technical improvements and soil fertility cultivation, and cotton production gradually increased. In 1956, a large-scale bumper harvest was achieved, with an average yield of 93 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Some people doubted whether disaster-stricken low-lying alkaline-saline land could also increase production. The exhibition answered this question: The Taizitan Basin in Quwo County, Shanxi Province, is a historically famous wasteland, which the masses described in a folk song: "Desolate waterlogged Taizitan, wolves, insects, and poisonous snakes hide in the grass, empty villages and isolated temples with few people, hard work to make a living!" In 1955, after eradicating water damage and improving the soil, and leveling the terrain, more than 8,000 mu of cotton were planted on more than 22,000 mu of farmland. In 1956, the average yield was 79 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the wasteland was transformed into a "golden and silver beach." Like the more than 5,000 mu of alkaline land in the Longhai Agricultural Cooperative in Dangshan County, Anhui Province, the salt-reclaimed fields in Gong'an Township, Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, and the Jiangbei District of Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, which suffered serious natural disasters… all achieved bumper harvests because they brought into play the role of collective management, seized the key to increasing production in light of local conditions, and implemented rational technical measures.

    The facts of high-yield typical examples exhibited here tell us that increasing production is not an easy task, because it requires farmers to change some unreasonable farming habits left over from history, which requires hard work. Farmers in Xiaomiao Township, Tianmen County, Hubei Province, have always been accustomed to "broadcasting" and "scattering seeds" in wheat fields, resulting in cotton seedlings being shaded by wheat seedlings, "dark and sunless," growing like sprouts. In 1950, they only harvested 30 jin of cotton and 90 jin of wheat. After many evaluations, demonstrations, and practical experiments, they changed broadcasting to "row planting," adopted measures such as "wide and narrow row planting of wheat, dense planting of cotton intercropped in wide rows, and early sowing" (all of which were successful after a considerable period of practice). Now, not only has the labor efficiency of the whole township increased, but the speed of production increase is also very fast. In 1956, the average yield was 109 jin of ginned cotton and 200 jin of wheat per mu, an increase of several times.

    The experiences of these high-yield typical examples all tell us that the potential for increasing cotton production is endless, as long as we continue to work hard, the targets proposed in the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft) -- starting from 1956, within twelve years, the cotton yield per mu will be increased from 35 jin (national average) in 1955 to 60 jin, 80 jin, and 100 jin respectively, depending on local conditions. It must be realized.

    The sericulture section attracts every visitor with a wide variety of products. Sericulture can be practiced almost everywhere in our country. On display here are mulberry silkworms, tussah silkworms, and castor silkworms. In recent years, the total output of cocoons and silk production has increased significantly. In 1949, it was only 860,000 dan, but in 1956 it increased to 2.71 million dan. Moreover, most of them can produce grade A or higher-quality raw silk. Look, the silk on display here is so bright and dazzling!

    What is encouraging is that the achievements of agricultural science and technology in our country have been effectively applied in silkworm production. For example, many silkworm eggs are bred after scientific research and strict national selection. Here, we see a high-yield typical example: the Shuguang Cooperative in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, uses the scientific silkworm rearing method of high-temperature sensitization of young silkworms to achieve high yields in just 22 days.

    In the sugar section, every exhibit raises noteworthy questions, captivating the viewers. A sugarcane plant a zhang tall is the Taitang No. 134 improved variety, like a strong young man; next to it is a short and thin local sugarcane variety, like a starving child. Seeing this contrast, who wouldn't want to choose improved varieties? Although densely planted sugar beets are small and sparsely planted ones are large, the guide tells people not to look at the form, as densely planted ones produce 10,000 jin more per hectare, with a sugar content 0.8% higher. Another interesting model tells us that if we cut the sugarcane lower when harvesting, the country can increase 50,000 tons of sugar every year. Currently, sugar production has increased by more than 15.6 million dan compared to before liberation. Here, we learned that sugar beet leaves, stems, and waste silk are originally juicy livestock feed, with a national output of 2.38 million tons per year. By-products of sugarcane and sugar beet can also be made into alcohol, paper, fiberboard (which can be soundproofed), yeast, wax, etc.

    We came to the colorful fruit and vegetable department. There are so many kinds of fruits. Taking pears as an example, there are fragrant pears with a fragrant aroma, winter pears that can be stored for a long time, snow pears with high yield, and apple pears that look and taste like apples. The vegetable department has surprisingly large Chinese cabbages, radishes, and Shandong scallions that are three or four feet long. Vegetables are essential for our daily life, but the seasonality of vegetables is the strongest. They are concentrated on the market during the peak season, and the supply is insufficient during the off-season. This is the most troublesome problem for workers in charge of non-staple food supply in cities and mining areas. After Dalian and Lushun implemented the method of staggered planting, phased harvesting, and balanced supply, citizens can eat fresh vegetables all year round. Harbin and other places have built greenhouses and use industrial waste heat to grow vegetables, so that even in the severe winter, they can eat cheap fresh vegetables, which is truly good news for workers and citizens. We also found it interesting that the clever members of the Xiguang Agricultural Cooperative in Sichuan Province actually intercropped nine kinds of vegetables on one piece of land, achieving a high yield of 30,000 jin per mu!

    Flax, flue-cured tobacco, tea, medicinal materials, etc. are all crops with high economic value. The guide tells us that the output of these products is also increasing year by year. Crops such as cotton, hemp, sugar, and flue-cured tobacco are raw materials for light industry and handicrafts. Silk, fruits, tobacco, and tea are the main export commodities. In recent years, the state has not only appropriately supplied the domestic market with the needs for these products but also exported a part of them, using them to exchange for many steel and machines. The total value of silk exported in the past six years is equivalent to the value of the nation's rails. Fruit exports have increased more than tenfold compared to 1950. Nearly one-third of tea production is exported, an increase of 318.5% in 1955 compared to 1949. It can be seen that developing the production of these economic crops is of great significance for our socialist construction.

    Economic crop production occupies an important position in agriculture. At present, farmers in various places are vigorously developing diversified operations, which is not only to meet the needs of the people but also a way to improve the lives of farmers. When introducing sugarcane planting, the Crop Pavilion II pointed out that this is a production with small investment and large profit. Guangdong Province invested 110,000 yuan in improved varieties from 1950 to 1955, and the revenue reached 15 million yuan. Planting a variety of economic crops is of special significance for mountainous areas. Crop Pavilion II specifically pointed out that fruit trees, mulberry trees, hemp, tea, etc. can all be "put on the mountains." Here, we see the achievements of the Leping Township Qikeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province, in developing sericulture in the mountains: This cooperative, with less than 100 members, used barren mountains to plant mulberry trees and raise silkworms on a large scale. In 1956, 47,700 mulberry trees were planted on the mountains, and this year, the income from silkworm rearing was 3,800 yuan. They have formulated a five-year plan: to start with "farming to support silkworms," then "silkworms to support silkworms," and finally "silkworms to support farming." As long as farmers in mountainous areas work tirelessly, the fact that "barren mountains become mulberry seas, and poor mountains become treasure mountains" will surely appear in more mountainous areas of the motherland!

    We also saw the creative achievements of the Delisi Agricultural Cooperative in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province. They planted apples on barren mountain land. Due to the good soil conservation work and strict technical management, they harvested 11,333,301 jin of apples in 1956. Could this have been imagined in the past?

    The resources of the motherland are so rich, and the hardworking farmers have accumulated so much valuable production experience. The development prospects of economic crops in our country are so vast!

    看我们的生活是多么绚烂
    ——记全国农业展览会农作物二馆
    本报记者　艾玲
    全国农业展览会农作物二馆的入口处，好像一片雪白的棉花的海洋。朵朵棉絮笑盈盈地迎接着客人。大厅的两边陈列着的是麻类、桑蚕、茶叶、烤烟，以及用这些产品制造出来的光洁的麻纱，艳丽的绸绢锦缎……。那金黄色的烟叶，那淡淡闪光的蚕茧，五光十色的水果蔬菜，像画屏似的草药，珍贵的鹿茸、人参，……相互辉映，琳琅满目。我国的经济作物越来越多，我们的生活的色彩就越来越绚烂，生活的趣味也就越来越浓厚。这里的展品，唤起我们对生活的热爱，和对创造它们的劳动农民的尊敬。
    展览会告诉我们，早在几千年前，我们的祖先就发明了栽桑养蚕和缫丝。中药是我们民族最珍贵的遗产之一，栽茶也有二千多年历史，麻和棉花在我国栽培也很悠久了。我们真要感激先人为我们培育和传播了这么丰富多采的经济作物。
    今天展览会上表现出来的我国几年来在经济作物生产上的巨大成就，可以向我们的祖先告慰：我们这一代并没有辜负他们千百万年的辛劳。
    让我们首先看看我国棉花生产的成就吧！
    从1949年到1956年，全国棉花总产量由八百八十八万担增加到三千一百零一万担，全国总平均每亩产量由二十一斤增到三十五斤。1956年全国有一千七百万亩的棉田，每亩生产皮棉超过五十斤；其中有三百万亩，每亩产皮棉达到一百斤。这是多么巨大的成就！
    这里陈列着十几种棉花新品种。讲解员告诉我们，要穿质量好的布，必须种良种棉。以前就因为用的是退化品种，所以产量低，只能织出市布和斜纹布。现在全国都在推广新品种。棉花的纤维比过去长了近四公厘，能织出府绸、卡叽和华达呢等优美的布了。还有一种有特殊用途的细绒棉，可用它作飞机汽车轮胎里的线帘布，现在已试种成功了。1956年，我国棉花良种的面积占全国棉田的总面积，由1952年的10％普及到90％左右。
    棉籽也有很多用处哩！这里陈列着一些留声片、电话机、透明梳子、人造丝、肥皂……都是用棉籽经过化学方法制成的。
    棉花增产的成就鼓舞着人们，同时推动了纺织工业的发展。1956年的棉布产量比1949年增加了一倍多。1949年平均全国每人只合得十二点二市尺布，1956年每人已合得二十八点五市尺布了。过去，农村里很少有人穿上花布新衣，现在哪个年轻姑娘没有一两件新花布衣服呢？
    人们以尊敬和羡慕的眼光观看那些棉花大面积丰产区的图片和丰产经验的典型。新疆吐鲁蕃县的五星农业社植棉一千八百亩，当地气候干燥雨少，由于采用灌溉和选用“斯三一七三”和“八五一七”品种，使一千六百五十六亩棉田平均亩产皮棉一百零九斤，其中二十亩地每亩产皮棉达三百斤以上。其他地区也都出现了一些县、区、乡、合作社的大面积丰产记录。
    在南方，有收完一季棉花再收一季粮食的地方，并且还连年获得大面积的丰产。浙江省的慈溪县有五十二亩棉田，除了一般技术措施做到之外，还给棉田普遍种植了绿肥。结果亩产八十五斤皮棉和一百二十斤小麦。
    许多丰产单位的自然条件并不是很优越的。山东省夏津县大部分都是旱地，施肥都不顶用，每亩平均产量不过二十余斤皮棉。合作化以后，农民们抓住当地干旱多风的特点，加强了防旱保墒、增施肥料等措施。1956年四百六十五万亩棉田丰产了，平均亩产皮棉七十斤，比丰收的1955年还高了40％。还有这样的棉区，陕西省的泾惠渠一带（包括五个县）有四十二万亩棉田，是一个古老的灌溉棉区。当初旱地得到渠水灌溉，产量显著提高；但连年种棉花，有机肥料施得少，又用大水漫灌，土壤碱化，棉花产量逐渐下降，1952年每亩皮棉产量竟降到二十五斤。以后，农民们进行了综合技术改进和地力的培养，棉花产量才逐渐提高，1956年获得大面积的丰收，平均每亩产皮棉九十三斤。有人怀疑受灾害的低洼碱盐地是不是也能增产，展览会上回答了这个问题：山西省的曲沃县太子滩盆地，是历史上有名的荒草滩，群众用一首歌谣来形容说：“荒凉水泊太子滩，狼虫毒蛇藏草间，空庄孤庙人烟少，辛勤劳动度日难！”1955年根除了水害，改良了土壤，使地势平坦后，在二万二千多亩耕地上种了八千多亩棉花，1956年每亩平均收获了七十九斤皮棉；荒草滩变成了“金银滩”。像安徽省砀山县陇海农业社的五千余亩碱地，江苏省南通县贡安乡的盐垦田，受着严重自然灾害的江西省彭泽县的江北区……都是因为发挥了集体经营作用，因地制宜地抓住了增产的关键，施行了合理的技术措施，而获得了丰产。
    这里展出的丰产典型事实告诉我们，增产并不是一件容易的事情，因为要农民改变一些历史上遗留下来的不合理的耕作习惯，需要作艰苦的工作。湖北省天门县小庙乡的农民在麦田间作棉花，一向习惯“撒播”、“抛天花”，结果棉苗被麦苗遮挡得“暗无天日”，长得像芽菜一样。1950年只收棉花三十斤，麦子九十斤。经过多次的评比、观摩、实际试验，才把撒播改为“条播”，采取“小麦宽窄行播种、棉花套种在宽行里密植，提早播种”等等措施（都是经过相当长时间实践成功的），现在全乡不仅劳动效率提高了，增产速度也很快，1956年平均每亩产皮棉一百零九斤，小麦二百斤，增产了数倍。
    这些丰产典型的经验，都告诉我们，棉花增产的潜力是无穷无尽的，只要继续努力，“全国农业发展纲要”（草案）中提出的指标——从1956年开始，在十二年内，棉花亩产皮棉按各地情况，由1955年的三十五斤（全国总平均数）分别增加到六十斤、八十斤、和一百斤。一定能够实现。
    蚕桑部分用多种多样的产品吸引住每个参观者。我国几乎到处都能生产蚕桑。这里展出的有家蚕、柞蚕、蓖麻蚕，几年来，蚕茧的总产量、出丝量都有显著提高。1949年只有八十六万担，1956年提高到二百七十一万担了。而且大都能生产甲级以上的优等生丝。看，这里陈列着的绢丝，多么鲜艳夺目！
    令人振奋的是，我国农业科学技术的成就，已经在桑蚕生产中得到有效的运用。例如，蚕种有许多都是经过科学研究再经过国家严格选择以后繁育的。这里，我们看到一个丰产典型：江苏省震泽县曙光社，用稚蚕高温感光的科学养蚕法，仅二十二天就能得到高额产量。
    糖料部分件件展品都向人提出了值得注意的问题，使看的人都入神了。一株丈把高的甘蔗，是台糖一三四号良种，像个健壮的小伙子；旁边是又低又瘦的土种甘蔗，像个饿坏了的孩子。看到这个对比，谁还不愿意选择良种呢？甜菜密植个儿虽小，稀植个儿虽大，讲解员叫人不要从形式上看，密植的每公顷多产一万斤，含糖率高0.8％。另一个有趣的模型告诉我们，收获时把甘蔗低砍一些，全国每年就可增加五万吨糖。目前，糖料比解放前增加了一万五千六百余担。在这里，我们了解到甜菜的叶、茎、废丝原来是多汁的牲畜饲料，全国每年可产二百三十八万吨。甘蔗甜菜的副产品还可制成酒精、纸、纤维板（可以隔音）、酵母、蜡等等。
    我们来到千红万紫的水果蔬菜部。水果的种类真多，就以梨子来说，有香得扑鼻的香梨，耐久藏的冬果梨、产量高的雪梨、还有不论形状和味道都像苹果的苹果梨。蔬菜部有大得出奇的大白菜、大萝卜、三四尺长的山东大葱。蔬菜是我们日常所必需的，但是，菜的季节性最强，旺季时集中上市，淡季又不够供应，这是各地城市工矿区副食品供应工作者最感头痛的问题。旅大推行了排开播种、分期收获、平衡供应的办法以后，使市民终年能吃上新鲜蔬菜。哈尔滨等地建立了温室，利用工业废热取暖种菜，即使在严冷的冬天，也能吃上价廉的新鲜蔬菜，这真是工人市民的福音。我们还感到有趣的是，四川省西光农业社聪明的社员们，竟在一块土地上套种了九种蔬菜，获得了亩产三万斤的高额产量！
    麻类、烤烟、茶叶、药材等都是有很高经济价值的作物。讲解员告诉我们，这些产品的产量也在逐年提高。棉花、麻、糖料、烤烟等作物都是轻工业和手工业的原料，丝绸、水果、烟、茶叶是外销的主要出口物资，几年来，国家不但适当供应了国内市场对这些产品的需要，而且出口了一部分，用它们换回来许多钢材、机器。六年来出口的丝绸总值相当于全国铁轨的价值。出口的水果比1950年增长了十几倍。茶叶差不多有三分之一的产量是出口的，1955年比1949年增长了318.5％。可见，发展这些经济作物生产，对于我们社会主义建设有着多么重要的意义。
    经济作物生产在农业中有着重要地位。目前各地农民都在大力发展多种经营，这不仅是为了满足人民的需要，而且也是提高农民生活的门径之一。农作物二馆在介绍种甘蔗的时候指出，这是一项投资小获利大的生产。广东省1950年到1955年在良种方面投资十一万元，收益竟达一千五百万元。种植多种多样的经济作物，对于山区更有特殊意义。农作物二馆特别指出果树、桑、麻、茶叶等等都是可以“上山”的。在这里，我们看到浙江省于潜县乐平乡七坑农业社在山区发展桑蚕的成绩：这个社不到一百户社员，社员们利用荒山大规模地种植桑树育蚕。1956年有四万七千七百株桑树上山，这一年养蚕收入了三千八百元。他们订出了五年规划：开始“以农养蚕”，继而“以蚕养蚕”，最后“以蚕养农”。只要山区农民努力不懈，“荒山变桑海、穷山变宝山”的事实一定会在祖国更多的山区里出现！
    我们还看到辽宁省复县得利寺农业社的创造性的成就。他们在土质瘠薄的山地上栽植苹果，由于做好保土工作和严格地加强技术管理，1956年收获苹果一千一百三十三万三千三百零一斤，这在过去难道是可以想像的事吗？
    祖国的资源是那么富饶，勤劳的农民已经积累了那么多的宝贵生产经验，我国经济作物的发展前途，是多么远大呵！
