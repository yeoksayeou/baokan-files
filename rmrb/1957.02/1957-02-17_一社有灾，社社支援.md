One Cooperative in Trouble, All Cooperatives Help
Yang Zhongchen

On November 29th of last year, the Baquan Town Firecracker Production Cooperative in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, accidentally caught fire. Five factory buildings and nearly a year's worth of hard work by the cooperative members – finished products, semi-finished products, and raw materials worth more than 8,000 yuan – were reduced to ashes. All that was salvaged were burnt scraps of paper, a few vats, and iron pots. The cooperative members who escaped from the fire, without cotton clothes in the sub-zero temperatures of more than thirty degrees below zero, were left with nowhere to eat and nowhere to sleep, especially the unmarried members.

After the incident, in addition to the higher-level joint cooperative providing loans to the firecracker cooperative to buy cotton clothes, hats, and shoes for the members, the members of the weaving production cooperative were the first to donate 61 yuan to the firecracker cooperative.

When the members of all the handicraft production cooperatives in the county heard the news, they actively donated to help, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and friendship among handicraft workers after the realization of cooperation. Nie Chaoxuan, a member of the Ironworkers' Cooperative No. 1, insisted on donating 5 jiao, despite having a large family and being dissuaded by others. Even the 25 members of the shoe repair cooperative, who had lower wages, donated 14 yuan and said, "Although we are not wealthy, we are much better off than those affected by the disaster. It is entirely right to support our brother cooperative." By mid-December, 14 cooperatives including weaving, ironwork, woodwork, leather, sewing, sheet metal, bicycle and watch repair, and shoe and hat repair, as well as one joint group and 440 cadres from the joint cooperative, had donated more than 340 yuan (including goods).

In addition, when the ironwork, woodworking, and carpentry cooperatives undertook to manufacture tools for the firecracker cooperative to resume production, they provided great convenience and assistance in terms of time and price. They put aside other work to do it for them first. The woodworking cooperative only charged the cost of raw materials and wages for the more than ten kinds of tools they made, without adding any profit.

The brother cooperatives' spiritual and material assistance to the firecracker cooperative was like sending charcoal in the snow. The members and families of the firecracker cooperative, after buying firewood, rice, cotton clothes, and bedding, were moved to tears. Sun Yao, the director of the cooperative, said with tears in his eyes, "If we hadn't taken the road of cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, who would have cared about us!"

The people who are organized are as close as flesh and blood, and they jointly withstood the storm of disaster. The firecracker cooperative had already resumed production on December 14th of last year. The members said: We are determined to use practical actions of striving to do a good job in production and meeting the needs of society to thank everyone for their deep concern for us.

    一社有灾，社社支援
    杨忠忱
    去年11月29日，黑龙江省拜泉县拜泉镇制硝鞭炮生产合作社不慎失火，五间厂房和社员们近一年来辛勤劳动的成果——价值八千多元的成品、半成品和原材料化为乌有，抢救出来的只是烧剩的废纸，几口缸和铁锅。从火堆里逃出来的社员，在零下三十多度的严寒里，身无棉衣，几个独身社员没处吃饭，没处睡觉。
    事情发生以后，除了上级联社为鞭炮社垫款替社员买了棉衣、棉帽、棉鞋外，编织生产合作社的社员们首先把六十一元捐款送给了鞭炮社。
    全县的手工业生产合作社的社员们听到这个消息，都积极捐款援助，充分表现出实现合作化后手工业者的团结友爱精神。铁工一社社员聂朝选，家里人口多，虽经别人劝阻，也非要捐五角钱不可。就连工资收入较少的修理鞋合作社的二十五个社员，也捐款十四元，并且说：“我们虽然不算富裕，但比受灾的还强得多，支援兄弟社是完全应该的。”到12月中旬，已有编织、铁业、木业、皮革、缝纫、白铁、自行车和钟表修理、鞋帽和修鞋等十四个社、一个联组以及联社干部四百四十人，捐款（包括实物在内）三百四十多元。
    此外，铁工、车木、木器等社在为鞭炮社承制复工生产的工具的时候，在时间、价格等方面，都给了极大的方便与帮助。放下别的活，先给他们做；木器社承做的十多种工具，只要原材料和工资钱，不加利润。
    兄弟社对鞭炮社的精神和物质援助，好比雪里送炭。鞭炮社的社员、家属买了柴、米、棉衣和被褥，都感动得流下泪来。社主任孙耀含着热泪感激地说：“要不是在共产党领导下走了合作化的道路，谁管咱们呵！”
    组织起来的人民亲如骨肉，他们共同抵挡了灾难的风暴。鞭炮社已经在去年12月14日恢复生产了。社员们说：我们决心用努力搞好生产、满足社会需要的实际行动来感谢大家对我们的深切关怀。
