    Lesson

    “The Lessons of the Hungarian Event”—this is the title of a section in a series of articles recently published in the Paris newspaper “Le Monde” by Anthony Nutting, who recently resigned as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. For Western imperialists, after their shameful failure in instigating a counter-revolutionary riot in Hungary, it is indeed natural and necessary to explore the lessons of this event.

    But how did Nutting understand the lessons of the “Hungarian Event”? He wrote self-indulgently: "The Hungarian event vaguely reveals opportunities and possibilities that no one would have believed in not long ago: it seems that assistance and encouragement can be given to national resistance (should be read as counter-revolutionary riots) against communism. NATO secretly provides weapons not only to Hungarian patriots (should be read as counter-revolutionary bandits) but also to patriots (should be read as counter-revolutionary bandits) in other satellite states."

    Thus, the “Hungarian Event” did not teach Nutting and his ilk the lessons they should have learned. However, Nutting's words reveal how shameless the Western countries were in spreading rumors in the past that the "Hungarian Event" was a spontaneous movement of the Hungarian people. Nutting has now once again confessed to the world that the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary were instigated by Western aggressive blocs, and the weapons used by the Hungarian counter-revolutionary bandits to massacre Hungarian patriots and innocent people were "secretly supplied" by them.

    Not only that, but Nutting also advocated that subversive activities in people's democratic countries should be the main means of Western countries' foreign policy in the future. He said self-righteously: constantly creating troubles within the socialist camp can "make Moscow focus its attention on its own security, and thus weaken the internal position of the Russians." Protracted implementation of this "ruse" can "defeat the Soviet Union." He also believes that this approach will not entail any significant risks.

    What a sweet calculation. But things will not be as Nutting imagined. Because, as the "Hungarian Event" shows, any attack by imperialism on the socialist camp will inevitably be met with a deserved counterattack. And Nutting's frank reactionary rhapsody is also quite instructive to us, reminding us: we must not relax our vigilance against the subversive conspiracies of imperialism! (Ping)

    教训
    “匈牙利事件的教训”，这是不久以前才辞去英国外交部国务大臣和议员职位的安东尼·纳丁最近在巴黎“新闻报”上连续发表一系列文章中一节的题目。对于西方的帝国主义者来说，他们在匈牙利策动反革命暴动遭到了可耻的失败之后，来探讨一下这一事件的经验教训，确是十分自然而且也是十分必要的。
    但是纳丁怎样来领会“匈牙利事件”的教训的呢？他竟然自我陶醉地写道：“从匈牙利事件使人隐约看出不久以前谁也不会相信的机会和可能性：看来大可以援助和鼓励针对共产主义的民族抵抗（应读作反革命暴动）。北大西洋公约组织不仅对匈牙利爱国者（应读作反革命匪徒），而且对其他各卫星国爱国者（应读作反革命匪徒）秘密提供武器”。
    这样说，“匈牙利事件”并没有使纳丁之流得到应有的教训。但是纳丁的这番言语却揭露了西方国家过去造谣说什么“匈牙利事件”是匈牙利人民自发的运动那种鬼话是多么的无耻。纳丁现在再一次向世人供认了：匈牙利的反革命暴动就是西方侵略集团策动的，匈牙利反革命匪徒用来屠杀匈牙利爱国者和无辜人民的武器就是他们“秘密供应”的。
    不仅如此，纳丁并且主张以后要把在人民民主国家进行颠覆活动作为西方国家外交政策的主要手段。他自以为是地说：在社会主义阵营内部不断进行捣乱，就可以“做到促使莫斯科把注意力放到自身的安全上去，做到因此削弱俄国人的内部阵地”。而长期实行这种“诱兵之计”，就能够“击败苏联”。他还认为这种做法不会有什么巨大的风险。
    多么如意的一个算盘呵。但是事情是不会像纳丁所想像那么如意的。因为正像“匈牙利事件”所表明的那样，帝国主义对社会主义阵营的任何进攻，都必然会遭到应有的回击。而纳丁的这一段坦率的反动狂想曲，对于我们也颇有教益，它提醒我们：不能对帝国主义的颠覆阴谋放松警惕！　（萍）
