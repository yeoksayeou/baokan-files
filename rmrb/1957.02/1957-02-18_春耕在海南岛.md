While the fields of northern China are still covered in white snow, Hainan Island in southern China is already in the midst of its busy spring plowing season.

At this time of year, driving through Hainan Island, one is presented with a series of beautiful tropical landscapes. The waterfalls on Wuzhi Mountain cascade down from the mountain peaks. Flocks of parakeets fly over green forests and fields. Coffee and mango trees are covered with white and orange-yellow blossoms. In the Wuzhi Mountain area, tens of thousands of Li women, who only learned to work in the fields after liberation, wear thin short skirts and floral tops, and bamboo hats. At dawn, they carry seedlings, walk out of villages under betel nut trees, and come to the fields to plant rice.

Hainan Island is the region with the earliest agricultural production season in China. When Beijing is still snowing, farmers on the island's east coast begin spring plowing and rice planting; when the spring plowing season ends on both sides of the Yangtze River, news of the summer harvest is already coming from here; when the wheat ripens in the Yellow River basin, farmers in the three-crop-a-year areas of the island begin sowing the middle rice crop. Although Hainan Island is engaged in farming and harvesting all year round, the production seasons in different regions are not the same. Wanning, Lehui, and Qiongdong counties on the east coast, and part of Wenchang County, have the earliest seasons and plant rice before the Spring Festival every year. The central region, which accounts for more than half of Hainan Island's cultivated land, begins plowing and planting after the Spring Festival, while some areas on the west coast are still in the stage of preparing for farming. By Qingming Festival, the entire island will have finished planting rice.

Walking into the coconut grove-covered Hainan countryside, you will see a production campaign underway to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture. On the eve of the Spring Festival, more than 700 townships on the island launched a production upsurge and completed the plan to plant one million mu of sweet potatoes in winter. Now, many regions have begun a competition campaign for advanced and prosperous agricultural cooperatives. The Fanmao Agricultural Cooperative of the Li people in the suburbs of Tongshi City under Wuzhi Mountain is one of the six model agricultural cooperatives that recently proposed launching a competition campaign for advanced and prosperous agricultural cooperatives to the island. A few days ago, when the reporter came to this cooperative, it was a bit cold in the mountains due to the influence of spring rain and cold air, but the Li ethnic group members were still working in the fields. According to the cooperative members, such high enthusiasm for labor was not seen before the establishment of the agricultural cooperative. This year, the cooperative plans to increase the yield per mu from more than 500 jin last year to 700 jin for all 900 mu of paddy fields. Wang Yuanchang, the Li ethnic group director of the cooperative, said that in 1955, before the establishment of the advanced cooperative, more than 200 Li families only planted more than 100 mu of rice in the spring. Last year, after the establishment of the cooperative, the spring planting area increased to more than 600 mu, and this year, the cooperative members are confident of planting more than 700 mu in the spring.

This year, Hainan Island has had continuous spring rain and abundant water sources. More than 20 large and small rivers on the island irrigate the fertile farmland on both banks. Many farmers along the coast are digging ditches and building water conservancy projects, and plan to build water conservancy to irrigate more than 500,000 mu of land this year. The construction of water conservancy is the most reliable guarantee for agricultural production on Hainan Island. This tropical island has hot weather and no frost or snow in winter. If there is a lack of rain, crops will suffer. In the late spring and early summer of 1955, because there was no rain, local party and government agencies had to mobilize nearly one million people to seal rivers, block rivers, dig wells, and fetch water to fight drought and protect seedlings. In 1956, many large and small water conservancy projects were built in various places, irrigating more than 900,000 mu of land. On the banks of the Taiyang River in Wanning County, because many new water conservancy projects have been built, the paddy fields in this irrigation area, which stretch for more than 20 *li*, have been connected into one piece by densely-webbed ditches. The rice seedlings planted in these fields more than a month ago are growing lush and green as far as the eye can see.

Wanning County has the earliest farming season on Hainan Island. Now, the seedlings here have grown to more than a foot high. Observing in the fields of this county, one will see that the seedlings are planted very neatly. The rows of green rice seedlings are straight when viewed from the front and straight when viewed from the side. Local cadres said that more than 80% of the paddy fields in the county implemented close planting of small seedlings in the spring plowing. Last year, they relied on pulling lines to plant, and this year they are doing well based on experience.

Fu, Deputy Director of the Agriculture Department of the Hainan Administrative Office, also came to Wanning County with a working group. I went to the countryside with them. Deputy Director Fu told me that their working group was just a small batch of the large number of cadres going to the countryside. In order to do a good job in spring plowing and production, the Hainan District Party Committee transferred 40% of the cadres from the Hainan Administrative Region-level party and government agencies to the countryside to strengthen the leadership of the county, district, and township. After the Secretary of the Wanning County Party Committee and the County Mayor went deep into the townships, cooperatives and fields, they drove the vast number of cadres to also go deep into them, and the practical actions of the cadres encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the masses. Wu Shengtan, Secretary of the Fifth District Committee of Wanning County, recently inspected spring plowing and production in Heshun Township and found many abandoned fields. He then led the cattle and plowed the fields himself. When the local agricultural cooperative members saw that the District Party Committee Secretary personally helped them plow more than four mu of fields, they were deeply moved, and they also went to work one after another, eliminating all the abandoned fields and quickly completing the spring plowing work.

When we were resting under the tall coconut trees, I opened the local newspaper and saw the Hainan District Party Committee's spring plowing instructions, calling on the island's 2.7 million people of all ethnic groups to strive to overfulfill this year's spring plowing task of 2.4 million mu. This year, Hainan Island plans to produce more than 1.9 billion *jin* of grain, an increase of 7% compared to 1956.

### 春耕在海南岛

    春耕在海南岛
    新华社记者　冯子平
    现在祖国北方的原野还铺盖着白雪的时候，祖国南方的海南岛，已经是春耕大忙了。
    这时候，在海南岛上坐汽车驶行，眼前呈现的是一幅幅绮丽的热带风光图。五指山上的瀑布，从高山之巅倾泻下来。成群的鹦哥飞过绿色的山林和原野。咖啡和芒果树上开满了白色和橙黄色的花朵。五指山区成千上万解放后才学会田间劳动的黎族妇女，她们身上只穿着薄薄的短裙花衣，头戴竹笠，天刚亮就挑着秧苗，走出槟榔树下的村庄，来到田间插秧。
    海南岛是我国农业生产季节最早的地区。当北京还在飘雪的时候，岛上东海岸的农民就开始春耕插秧；当长江两岸春耕结束的时候，这里就传出夏收的喜讯；当黄河流域麦子成熟的时候，岛上一年三熟地区的农民又开始了中造稻的播种工作。海南岛虽然一年到头都在耕作和收获，但各地的生产季节也并不一致。季节最早的东海岸万宁、乐会、琼东三县和文昌县一部分地区，每年都是插完秧过春节。占海南岛耕地面积一半多一些的中部地区，春节后才开始犁田插秧，而西海岸的部分地区，现在还在备耕阶段。到清明，全岛才插完秧。
    走进椰林密布的海南农村，便会看到一个争取农业大丰收的生产运动正在开展。春节前夕，岛上有七百多个乡掀起生产高潮，完成了冬种番薯一百万亩的计划。现在，许多地区又开始掀起先进富裕社竞赛运动。五指山下通什市郊黎族的番茅农业社，就是最近向全岛农业社倡议开展先进富裕社竞赛运动的六个模范农业社中的一个。前几天，记者来到这个社的时候，因为春雨和寒流的影响，山中有些寒冷，但黎族社员还是下田耕作。像这样高的劳动热情，据社员说是在办农业社以前看不到的。全社九百多亩水田，今年计划每亩产量要从去年的五百多斤提高到七百斤。这个社的黎族社长王元昌说，1955年没办高级社的时候，二百多户黎族农民春天只插水稻一百多亩，去年建社后春插面积增加到六百多亩，今年社员都有信心做到春耕插秧七百多亩。
    今年海南岛春雨连绵，水源充沛。岛上二十多条大小河流灌溉着两岸肥沃的农田。沿岸许许多多的农民开沟挖渠，兴修水利工程，今年计划修水利灌溉五十万亩以上的田地。兴修水利，是海南岛农业生产最可靠的保证。这个热带岛屿，天气炎热，冬天也没有霜雪，如果缺雨，农作物就要遭殃。1955年春末夏初，因为没有雨，当地党政机关只好动员近百万人封江堵河挖井要水，抗旱保苗。1956年，各地修了许多大小水利工程，灌溉田地九十多万亩。在万宁县太阳河畔，因为新修了不少水利工程，这个灌溉区中纵横二十多华里的水田，已被密如蛛网的沟渠连成一片，这些田里一个多月前插的秧苗，长得绿油油的一眼望不到边。
    万宁县在海南岛上是耕作季节最早的地区，现在，这里的禾苗已经长到一尺多高。在这个县的田里观察，便会看到秧苗插的很整齐，一行行葱绿的禾苗，正面看是直的，侧面看也是直的。当地干部说，这个县有80％以上的稻田春耕中实行小株密植。去年是靠拉线插，今年凭经验干也很好。
    海南行政公署农业处傅副处长率领的工作组也到万宁县来了。我跟他们一道到农村去。傅副处长告诉我，他们工作组只是大批下乡干部中的一小批。海南区党委为了搞好春耕生产，从海南行政区一级党政机关抽调了40％的干部下乡，充实县区乡的领导。万宁县委书记和县长深入乡、社和田间后，带动了广大干部也深入下去，而干部的实际行动又鼓舞了群众的劳动热情。万宁县第五区区委书记吴盛坦，最近到和顺乡检查春耕生产，发现了许多荒田，他便自己牵牛背犁，到田里去犁。当地农业社员看到区委书记亲自帮自己犁了四亩多田，深受感动，也纷纷出工，全部消灭了荒田，很快地完成了春耕工作。
    当我们坐在高高的椰子树下休息的时候，我打开当地出版的报纸，看到了海南区党委的春耕指示，号召全岛二百七十万各族人民努力争取超额完成今年春耕二百四十万亩的任务。今年，海南岛计划生产粮食十九亿多斤，比1956年增产7％。
