　　China's mountain forest sideline production has great potential. In some areas, the income from mountain forest sidelines accounts for one-third to one-half or more of the total income from agricultural sidelines. Mountain forest sideline products are diverse. Industrial raw materials include rosin, cork, tung oil, camphor, tannin, etc.; food includes fruits, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, honey, etc.; medicinal materials include pilose antler, musk, ginseng, cinnamon, poria cocos, etc.; and there are also furs of various wild birds and animals, etc. These sideline productions are not only related to the economic benefits of the people in mountainous areas and the living needs of the people in the country, but also related to the country's foreign trade and the entire economic construction.
　　At present, some agricultural production cooperatives in mountainous areas have already carried out mountain forest sideline production according to local conditions after preliminary planning, and have made considerable achievements; at the same time, many places have also encountered some problems due to lack of work experience.
　　First of all, some rural leading cadres are afraid that after developing mountain forest sideline production, the members will all engage in sideline occupations, which will affect the agricultural production and income of the community; they are afraid that the members' engagement in household sideline occupations will develop capitalism and disrupt the market. Therefore, they do not actively lead agricultural cooperatives to carry out sideline production. Although there is a sideline production team or group in some agricultural cooperatives, it is entirely composed of the old, weak, women and children, and cannot meet the needs of mountain forest sideline production. Due to the lack of unified and reasonable arrangement of labor for agricultural and sideline production, mountain forest sideline production is often squeezed out. For example, in 19 townships in Dikou and Xiaoqiao districts of Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, the production of dried bamboo shoots decreased by more than 690,000 catties last year, mainly because cadres did not allow farmers to go to the mountains to dig bamboo shoots during the bamboo shoot digging season, but mobilized the masses to go down the mountains to engage in agriculture. At the same time, some agricultural cooperatives have also stipulated unreasonable labor remuneration for managing mountain forest sideline production. For example, hunters in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, are only given work points for hunting wild animals in the mountains, but not for those who do not catch them, and no rewards are given for those who catch more. The original organized hunters had more than 500 people, but due to the unreasonable assessment of work points, there are now only more than 100 people left, which seriously affects their hunting enthusiasm and reduces the production of fur.
　　Secondly, some regions are not clear enough about the guiding principles for leading mountain area sideline production, lack technical guidance, and have produced partiality and blindness in production. Some agricultural cooperatives, in carrying out diversified operations and developing mountain area sideline production, only care about immediate interests and regard indiscriminate logging as a sideline production of "no cost and profit". Many townships in Jiangle County, Fujian Province, once put forward the slogan of "entering the mountains to collect treasures" and "marching into the forests", so that all the large and small fir trees in Zujiao, Dayuan and other four townships in the county were cut down in a few days; Shangdun Township Rong'an Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Minhou County once mobilized more than 300 members to enter the forest area and cut down all the bamboo they saw, regardless of mother bamboo or son bamboo. In the past two or three months, many areas in Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces have also experienced extremely serious indiscriminate logging. This phenomenon not only occurs in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, but also in plain areas; not only is timber forest cut down indiscriminately, but also water source forest, protective forest, scenic forest, and mother trees and young trees of economic forests. Furthermore, artificial cultivation of shiitake mushrooms, poria cocos, ginseng, and stripping of bark from cork trees and eucommia trees, etc., also destroy a large number of trees every year due to improper operation. There are also many products, such as jujube kernels and bupleurum, whose quality is reduced or even many unqualified products are produced due to lack of technical guidance in cultivation or processing, resulting in stockpiling.
　　Thirdly, commercial departments still have some shortcomings in the purchase and sale of mountain forest by-products. The purchase plan is sometimes large and sometimes small, the purchase price fluctuates, the purchase and sale range is narrow, and the allocation is not timely, often resulting in either stockpiling or out of stock. These phenomena have also seriously affected the restoration and development of forest and sideline specialties. For example, the gallnut produced in Shicheng County, Jiangxi Province, has not been purchased for a long time. In Geban Township, Shangrao County, due to the low purchase price of moso bamboo and bamboo silk, the masses have completely burned one-third of the moso bamboo mountains and replanted them with corn. More than 20 counties in Heilongjiang Province produce agaric, but due to the low purchase price, there has been a shortage of agaric in many local markets in the province recently. Even Nenjiang County, which is rich in agaric, could not buy agaric from June to mid-September last year. In some areas of Baode County, Shanxi Province, the purchase price of licorice root is less than one cent per catty. Winter flower and astragalus in Xingxian, Wuzhai, Ningwu and other places are not purchased at all. Therefore, the masses said dissatisfiedly: "Digging medicinal materials is not as good as cutting firewood." In addition, many mountain forest sideline productions require a certain amount of working capital, such as managing oil tea, papermaking, planting poria cocos, etc., all require a lot of investment before production. Sometimes, production is not conducive because agricultural cooperatives lack funds, and the advance payment from purchasing departments or bank loans is not timely.
　　In order to better carry out mountain forest sideline production, increase farmers' income and national wealth, it is hoped that the departments leading agricultural and forestry production in various places will strengthen the organization and leadership of mountain forest sideline production, and formulate practical plans for developing agriculture and mountain forest sideline production based on the principle of both consolidating agricultural cooperatives and taking care of the interests of members, rationally dividing the scope of collective management and individual management of members, appropriately solving the labor organization, labor remuneration, and production fund in carrying out mountain forest sideline production; and educate farmers to combine current interests with long-term interests, and not to cut down trees indiscriminately. Under the principle of not destroying forests and maintaining soil and water, forestry departments should actively cooperate with relevant production and purchasing departments to give farmers as much production convenience and technical guidance as possible, reasonably adjust the prices of forest and sideline products, and provide agricultural cooperatives and forestry cooperatives with the necessary financial support for managing mountain forest sideline production. In short, the departments leading agricultural and forestry production must closely cooperate with other relevant economic departments, strengthen leadership and assistance to agricultural cooperatives, so that mountain forest sideline production can be better carried out.

    各部门密切配合，更好地发展山林副业生产
    林经山
    我国山林副业生产潜力很大，有些地区的山林副业收入要占农业副业总收入的三分之一到二分之一以上。山林副业产品是多种多样的。工业原料有松脂、栓皮、桐油、樟脑、单宁等；食品有果类、竹笋、蕈类、蜂蜜等；药材有鹿茸、麝香、人参、桂皮、茯苓等；还有各种野生鸟兽的毛皮等等。这些副业生产，不仅关系到山区群众的经济收益和国内人民的生活需要，还关系到国家的对外贸易和整个经济建设。
    目前，有些山区农业生产合作社经过初步筹划以后，已经因地制宜地开展了山林副业生产，做出了不少成绩；同时，也有不少地方由于缺乏工作经验，发生了一些问题。
    首先，有些农村领导干部怕发展山林副业生产后社员们都去搞副业而影响社里的农业生产和社里的收入；怕社员经营家庭副业会发展资本主义，搞乱了市场。因此，不积极地去领导农业社开展副业生产。有的农业社内虽然有一个副业生产队或组，但是完全是由老弱妇孺组成的，不能适应山林副业生产的需要。由于对农副业生产的劳动力没有进行统一合理的安排，结果常常挤掉了山林副业生产。如福建省建瓯县迪口、小桥两个区有十九个乡，去年笋干减产六十九万多斤，主要原因是正当挖笋季节，干部不让农民上山挖笋，却动员群众下山搞农业。同时，有些农业社对经营山林副业生产的劳动报酬也规定得不合理，如黑龙江省桦川县猎民狩猎，上山打着野兽的才给记工分，打不着不给记工分，打得多的也不给奖励。原来已经组织起来的猎民有五百多人，因评工记分不合理，现在只剩一百多人，严重影响他们的狩猎积极性，减少了毛皮的生产。
    其次，有些地区对领导山区副业生产的方针还不够明确，缺乏技术指导，在生产上产生了片面性和盲目性。有些农业社在开展多种经营、发展山区副业生产工作中，只顾眼前利益，竟把滥砍林木当作“无本生利”的副业生产。福建省将乐县不少乡曾提出“进山取宝”、“向森林进军”的口号，使该县祖教、大源等四个乡的大小杉木在几天之内全部砍光；闽侯县上塅乡榕岸高级农业社曾发动三百多个社员进入林区，不管母竹、子竹，见竹就砍。最近两三个月内，广东、广西等省不少地区也出现了极为严重的滥伐林木的现象。这种现象不但发生在山区、半山区，还发生在平原区；不仅乱砍用材林，而且乱砍水源林，防护林、风景林和经济林的母树和幼林。又如人工培植香菰、茯苓、人参和剥取黄柏、杜仲的树皮等，由于操作不当，每年也要毁坏大量的树木。还有很多产品，如枣仁、柴胡等，在培植上或加工上，因为缺乏技术指导，减低了产品的质量，甚至生产出许多不合规格的产品，造成积压。
    第三，商业部门在山林副产品的购销经营方面还有一些缺点。收购计划时大时小，收购价格忽高忽低，购销面窄，调拨不及时，时常不是积压就是脱销。这些现象也严重地影响了林副业特产的恢复和发展。如江西省石城县出产的五棓子，很长一个时期没人收购。上饶县革坂乡由于毛竹、竹丝收购价格低，群众已将三分之一的毛竹山完全烧毁，改种了玉米。黑龙江省有二十多个县出产木耳，由于收购价格偏低，最近省内许多地方的市场上，都发生了木耳脱销现象。甚至连盛产木耳的嫩江县，去年6月到9月中旬也买不到木耳。山西省保德县有些地方的甘草收购价，每斤不到一分钱。兴县、五寨、宁武等地的冬花、黄芪，根本无人收购。因此，群众不满地说：“刨药材还不如砍山柴。”此外，许多山林副业生产需要一定周转资金，如经营油茶、造纸、种茯苓等，在进行生产之前都需要不少投资，有时因为农业社缺乏资金，采购部门的预购付款或银行贷款又不及时，都不利于生产。
    为了更好地开展山林副业生产，增加农民收入和国家财富，希望各地领导农业林业生产的部门，加强对山林副业生产的组织领导工作，根据既能巩固农业社，又能照顾社员利益的原则，制定切实可行的发展农业和山林副业生产的全面规划，合理划分集体经营和社员个人经营的范围，适当解决开展山林副业生产中的劳动组织、劳动报酬和生产基金等问题；并且教育农民把目前利益和长远利益结合起来，不要滥砍滥伐树木。在不破坏森林和水土保持的原则下，林业部门要主动地配合有关生产、收购部门，尽量给农民以生产上的方便和技术上的指导，合理调整林副产品的价格，给农业社和林业社以经营山林副业生产所必需的资金支援。总之，必须领导农林业生产的部门同其他有关经济部门的密切配合，加强对农业社的领导和帮助，才能更好地开展山林副业生产。
