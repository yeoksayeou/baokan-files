    A Tricycle Worker
    Quan Rongda

    One afternoon, I rode my bicycle into the city to buy a bookcase. Because I couldn't find a suitable one, I spent three hours running around without any luck. Finally, I managed to find one at the Xidan Second Woodworking Cooperative, but it wasn't a bookcase, it was a kitchen cabinet. I hired a tricycle to transport it.

    It was already dark, and I was very anxious because I only had a little over an hour left on my leave. I urged the tricycle worker to hurry up with the binding, saying that it could be a little sloppy, as long as it didn't fall off. But he didn't. He tied it carefully and securely, and padded every corner of the kitchen cabinet that touched the rope with rags or cotton scraps. I said it wasn't necessary, but he said:

    "No, it's better to pad it. It cost several tens of yuan to buy, it would be a pity if even a little bit of the paint got scratched!"

    When I heard him say this, I thought he was right, so I hurried to help him.

    "Are you getting married, settling down?" he suddenly asked.

    "No, I'm not getting married, I don't even have a girlfriend yet." I hurriedly explained.

    He smiled and said:

    "Then why are you buying a kitchen cabinet? Young man, why are you lying? Getting married is a good thing!"

    I told him that I bought the kitchen cabinet as a substitute because I couldn't find a suitable bookcase. He said "Oh."

    The kitchen cabinet was tied up, the tricycle worker got on the vehicle, and I got on my bicycle. We hurried home.

    "Hey, comrade, turn on your light! Turn on your light!" I heard the traffic police shout.

    "The light is broken." I turned my head and said apologetically to the traffic police.

    For some reason, the traffic police didn't ask me to get off the vehicle, and actually let me go.

    When I caught up with the tricycle worker and walked alongside him, he suddenly said to me:

    "Move to the right, get off!"

    "What's wrong? Is the rope loose?" I asked impatiently, even a little rudely.

    But he didn't answer, he just waited for me to get off. I had no choice but to get off.

    "What are you doing?" I asked.

    "What am I doing," he didn't look at me, pointed to a grocery store and said, "Go buy a paper lantern! You didn't check it when you left, and you still don't correct it when you know it's wrong, how can that be?"

    I finally understood why he asked me to get off the vehicle. At the same time, I was intimidated by his serious face.

    I bought a paper lantern and we continued on our way.

    I unconsciously pedaled my bicycle, vaguely lost in thought. For some reason, Lu Xun's "A Small Incident" floated into my mind. I felt that the worker next to me was tall and remarkable, while I was ashamed and shrunk into a ball – a small ball.

    Suddenly, I woke up from my reverie. I looked at my watch, "Oh dear, there's only one hour left!" I pedaled faster. My bicycle was in front of the tricycle, sometimes pulling it far, far away. So I had to slow down a little, even though I was very anxious.

    "What, are you in a hurry?" the tricycle worker asked, catching up.

    "Yes, I have to get home before seven o'clock." I replied, and told him about the military regulation that soldiers must return to the team on time.

    "What time is it now?" he asked.

    "Six ten."

    "Ah, I can't possibly get there in fifty minutes."

    "What should I do?" I frowned and pondered.

    "How about this," he said, "you go back first, I'll come later."

    "What?" I doubted if I had heard correctly.

    "I said you go back first, you can ride your bicycle and get there before seven."

    "Is… is that okay?"

    "Why not?" he said, "Are you afraid of losing your things?"

    "No, I don't mean that..." I defended myself.

    "Yes," he said, as if he hadn't heard my words. "There was a small group of people among us who have done some bad things. But that was before, it's different now."

    Speaking of this, he paused for a moment. I looked at him with surprise and joy. In the light of the street lamp, I saw that his hair was already gray, but his eyes were still bright. Judging from his slightly hunched back and two large hands, he was an old man who had experienced a lot.

    "Do you know how this kind of bad thing was eradicated?" he said: "It's a long story. In the past, the Kuomintang couldn't eliminate it with whips, prisons, and bayonets, but when the Communist Party came, it disappeared. Who would want to do that kind of shameful thing? Don't believe it? Try it, find any tricycle worker and give him something, even if it's gold and silver treasures, as long as you tell him the address, he'll definitely deliver it to your door."

    While saying these words, you could hear from his voice that he was so excited and excited.

    I looked at him again with respect, and my heart couldn't help but jump with excitement. I wanted to say something, but what could I say? In front of such an honest, simple, and frank old man! I mustered up my courage and said:

    "Thank you. I'll go first, you take your time."

    一个三轮车工人
    权容达
    一天下午，我乘自行车进城买书柜，因为没有合适的，跑了整整三个钟头还没买上。最后，总算在西单第二木器合作社选购了一个，但不是书柜，而是厨柜；雇了一辆三轮车准备运走。
    天已经黑了，我很着急，因为请假时间只剩下了一个多钟头。我催着三轮车工人快点捆绑，说马虎点可以，只要掉不下来就行。可是他却不然，他在那里又仔细、又牢固地捆绑着，并且在厨柜的碰到绳子的每一棱角上都垫上破布或乱棉花。我说这不必，他却说：
    “不，还是垫的好。花了几十块钱买的东西，哪怕磨损了一点油漆也是怪可惜的啊！”
    我听他这样说，觉得也很对，于是就忙着帮他。
    “你要结婚了，安顿家庭？”他忽然问。
    “不，我不结婚，我连对象还没有呢。”我急忙解释。
    他笑着说：
    “那么买厨柜做什么？青年人，为什么要撒谎呢？结婚是一件好事呀！”
    我把没有合适的书柜才买厨柜来代用的事告诉他了。他“噢”了一声。
    厨柜捆绑完了，三轮车工人跨上了车，我也上了自行车，我们急忙地往家走。
    “喂，同志，开灯！开灯！”听见交通警的喊声。
    “灯坏了。”我回头望着交通警抱愧地说。
    不知是什么缘故，交通警没有叫我下车，竟把我放走了。
    当我追上那位三轮车工人，和他并肩走去的时候，他突然对我说：
    “往右边靠，下车！”
    “怎么啦？绳子松了吗？”我不满地、甚至有点粗暴地问。
    可是他不回答，只是等着我下车。我无可奈何，只好下车了。
    “做什么？”我问。
    “做什么，”他并不看我，指了指一家杂货店说，“去买一个纸灯！出门的时候不检查一下，现在知道不对了还不改正，这样行吗？”
    我这才领悟他叫我下车的原因，同时我被他那严肃的脸孔吓住了。
    纸灯买回来了，我们继续走。
    我下意识地蹬着车子，朦胧地陷入了沉思。不知为什么，这时鲁迅的“一件小事”浮在我的脑子里，觉得旁边的那位工人是高大的、了不起的，而自己则惭愧得缩成一团——小小的一团。
    忽然间我从沉思中惊醒了过来。我看了看表，“唉呀，只剩一个钟头了！”我加快蹬了起来。我的车走在三轮车的前面，有时把它拉得老远老远的。于是我又不得不把脚放慢一点，虽然心里是很急的。
    “怎么，着急啦？”赶上来的三轮车工人问。
    “是的，我得在七点钟以前赶回家去。”我回答，并把军人请假，一定要按时归队的规定告诉他了。
    “现在几点了？”他问。
    “六点十分。”
    “啊，五十分钟内，我无论如何是赶不到的。”
    “那怎么办呢？”我皱起眉头苦思起来。
    “这样吧，”他说，“你先回去，我后来。”
    “什么？”我怀疑自己是否听错话了。
    “我说你先回去，你骑着自行车可以在七点前赶到。”
    “这……这行吗？”
    “怎么不行？”他说，“你怕丢了东西是不是？”
    “不，我不是这个意思……”我为自己辩护。
    “是啊，”他说，好像没听见我的话。“我们中间有那么一撮人，他们曾做过一些坏事。可是这是以前的事，现在就不同啦。”
    说到这里，他停了一会儿。我用又惊又喜的眼光望着他。借路灯的光，我看见他的头发已经斑白了，可是眼睛还炯炯有神。从他那微微驼的背和两只粗大的手看来，他是一位饱经风霜的老人。
    “你知道这种坏事是怎么绝迹的吗？”他说：“说起来话可长了。过去，国民党用鞭子、监狱、刺刀也消灭不了的，共产党来了，就没有了。谁还愿意干那种丢人的事呢？不信，试试看，你随便找哪一个三轮车工人，交给他东西，那怕是金银宝贝，只要你把地址告诉他，没错，他准会送到你门口。”
    说这些话时，从他的声音里可以听出他是那样的激动和兴奋。
    我再一次以尊敬的目光望着他，心里不禁激动得跳起来，我想说话，但我说什么呢？在这样一位诚实、淳朴而坦率的老人面前！我鼓起勇气说：
    “谢谢。我先走啦，您慢慢来吧。”
