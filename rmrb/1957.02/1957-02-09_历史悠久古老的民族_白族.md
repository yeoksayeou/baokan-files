The Yunnan Minority Social History Investigation Group, organized by the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, has concluded its preliminary survey of historical relics in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture. This investigation proves that the Bai people are a long-standing and ancient ethnic group.

Before the investigation, the investigation group consulted many relevant documents. Based on the clues provided by these documents, they conducted field investigations in eight counties including Dali, Jianchuan, and Fengyi. In over a month, they inspected many important sites of the ancient Nanzhao Kingdom and Dali Kingdom, and collected some cultural relics.

Polished stone axes and stone knives from the Neolithic Age were unearthed in Dianwei Village, Jianchuan County, and Shangda Village, Shandashang Village, Weishan Yi Autonomous County. They show that humans inhabited the area around Erhai Lake a long time ago. The stone carvings on Shibao Mountain in Jianchuan depict the court ceremonies and costumes since the founding of the Nanzhao Kingdom in 736 AD. Many newly discovered scriptures in Baitangtian, Fengyi County, include Song and Yuan Dynasty printed editions, and a hand-copied edition from the eighth year of Baotian of the Dali Kingdom (approximately 1136 AD) and a Ming Dynasty hand-copied edition. The Ming Dynasty hand-copied edition also contains translations of Bai language in Chinese characters, providing new materials for the study of Bai language and writing. Oral literature contains an exceptionally rich trove of historical legends.

After returning to Kunming, the investigation group, along with personnel and experts from the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee, the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, and other relevant departments, studied a plan for systematically excavating and collecting Bai historical relics, and prepared to gradually launch a comprehensive investigation.

    历史悠久古老的民族——白族
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会组织的云南少数民族社会历史调查组，结束了大理白族地区历史文物的初步察访工作。这次调查证明，白族是一个历史悠久、古老的民族。
    调查组在察访前，曾参阅了许多有关的文献，根据文献所提供的线索，他们到大理、剑川、凤仪等八个县作了实地调查。在一个多月的时间里，他们察看了古南诏国和大理国的许多重要遗址，搜集到了一些文物。
    剑川县甸尾村和巍山彝族自治县山达上村出土有新石器时代的磨光石斧石刀等。它们表明，很早以前洱海的周围就有过人类居住。剑川石宝山的石刻，描绘了公元736年南诏国开国以来，宫廷的仪式和服饰。在凤仪县白汤天新发现的许多经卷，其中有宋元刻本，并且还有一本大理国保天八年（约为公元1136年）和明代的手抄本，明代手抄本中还有用汉字记录白语的译文，对白族语言文字的研究提出了新的材料。口头文学中，更蕴藏了异常丰富的历史传说。
    调查组在回到昆明以后，与中共云南省委员会、云南省人民委员会、大理白族自治州等有关部门的人员和专家们，一起研究了今后系统发掘和搜集白族历史文物工作的计划，准备逐步展开全面的调查工作。
