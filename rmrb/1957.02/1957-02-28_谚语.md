    Proverbs
    Man is iron, food is steel; fields without fertilizer, crops won't grow.
    Business money is for immediate needs; farming money lasts ten thousand years.
    If you beat the bird outside the door, you lose the old hen at home.
    People cheat the land, and the land cheats the belly.
    If you collect fertilizer actively, the cost of spring plowing is low.
    Business deals are like fleeting flowers, but the plough tail cannot be blown down by a storm.
    Farming depends on ponds, life depends on grain.

    谚语
    人是铁，饭是钢，田无肥，禾不长。
    生意钱，顾眼前，锄头钱，万万年。
    打了门前见眼鸟，丢了家里老鸡婆。
    人哄地皮，地哄肚皮。
    积肥抓得起，春耕成本低。
    生意买卖眼前花，狂风吹不倒犁尾巴。
    作田靠塘，养命靠粮。
