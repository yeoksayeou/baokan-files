International Notes

    "If only I could fly freely in the sky like a bird" – countless poets throughout history have used similar lines to express people's longing for freedom. But now, even birds – like wild geese – cannot soar as they please in the skies over the American continent; because they are at risk of being intercepted at any time as unidentified airplanes.
    The U.S. Air Force authorities recently revealed that American jet fighters, currently equipped with nuclear missiles, are scrambling almost daily to intercept airplanes of unknown nationality. In the past two weeks alone, there have been eighteen such "scrambling" incidents. Each time they take off, the pilots are ordered: "If you cannot identify" the "nationality" of one or more aircraft detected on the radar screen, "shoot it down." A U.S. Air Force spokesman also explained that such interception is absolutely necessary, "because an aircraft of unknown nationality, unless intercepted, could signify the beginning of a devastating nuclear attack on the United States."
    According to this spokesman, the United States is in such great danger. But one cannot help but ask: Where do so many aircraft of unknown nationality come from? And who is going to launch "a devastating nuclear attack" on the United States?
    It turns out that Pentagon officials said rather bashfully that these unidentified aircraft often turn out to be American commercial or military aircraft that may have strayed off course, been delayed, or failed to submit complete flight plans. Not only that, but sometimes these unidentified aircraft are just "flocks of wild geese." For the war hysterics on the other side of the ocean, it can truly be said that "a rustle in the wind is mistaken for the cry of wild geese, every bush and tree looks like an enemy soldier."
    Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal, who committed suicide by jumping from a building a few years ago, mistook the sound of fire engine bells for air raid sirens of Soviet aircraft, which has become a laughingstock for people all over the world. Now it seems that the ridiculousness of the Pentagon officials is no less than that of their deceased old boss.

### 风声“雁”唳

    风声“雁”唳
    “但愿能像鸟儿那样无拘无束地在天空中飞翔”这样类似的诗句，曾经被古今不知多少诗人用来表达人们对自由的渴望。但是现在在美洲大陆的上空，连鸟儿——像大雁，也不能随心所欲地翱翔了；因为它们随时有被当作国籍不明的飞机而遭到截击的危险。
    美国的空军当局最近透露，目前正在以核子导弹装配起来的美国喷气式战斗机，几乎每天都匆忙起飞截击国籍不明的飞机。最近半个多月当中，已经发生过十八次这种“匆忙起飞”的事件。每一次起飞的时候，驾驶员都奉令：“如果不能辨明”雷达镜中所探测到的一架或许多架飞机所属“的国籍，就‘击落它’”。美国空军的发言人并且解释说：这种截击是十分必要的，“因为，一架国籍不明的飞机，除非是被截住了，否则就可能意味着美国将要遭受的一次摧毁性的核子攻击的开始。”
    照这位发言人说来，美国是处于多大的危险之中呵。但是人们不禁要问：从何而来这么多国籍不明的飞机呢？并且又是谁要对美国进行“一次摧毁性的核子攻击”呢？
    原来事情是这样：五角大楼的官员颇为腼腆地说：这种国籍不明的飞机结果往往就是美国的商用飞机或者军用飞机，它们也许是走错了航线、耽误了时间，也许是没有提出完备的飞行计划来。不仅如此，有时候这种国籍不明的飞机不过是“成群的飞雁”。对于大洋彼岸的战争歇斯底里病患者们，真可以说是“风声‘雁’唳，草木皆兵”了。
    几年前跳楼自杀的前美国国防部长福莱斯特尔把救火车的铃声当作是苏联飞机空袭的警报，已成为普天下人们的笑柄。现在看来，五角大楼的官员们的可笑程度，绝不稍逊于他们已经死了的老上司。
