    (By our correspondent) According to the Gansu Daily, after the counties of Dingxi Special District in Gansu Province basically completed the transition to communes and the final accounting and distribution in December 1956, the local Party committees and village branches immediately shifted their leadership focus to spring plowing preparations. The secretary of the District Committee, the secretary of the County Committee, and other responsible cadres led a large number of cadres to go deep into the rural areas to promote current production. According to statistics from the Special District organs and six counties including Huining, 692 cadres went to work in the rural areas during this period. In order to prevent the threat of drought, all localities have prominently focused on watering winter fields and preparing the land to conserve moisture. Jingyuan has already watered 110,742 mu of winter fields, reaching 92.4% of the total area of irrigated land. Yongdeng and Lintao watered 200,000 mu of winter fields, accounting for more than 80% of the 250,000 mu that should be watered. The winter irrigation area in Weiyuan increased by more than 4,000 mu compared with last year. Where conditions permitted, small-scale water conservancy projects were continued. Snow removal and ice breaking have also been widely carried out. Wang Jizhou, Deputy County Head of Weiyuan County, personally carried snow to motivate the masses, and 3,015 mu of land in 14 townships across the county have been covered with snow.
    The movement to accumulate manure and deliver fertilizer is more vigorous than before. According to understanding in 20 townships in Lintao: Fertilizer for summer fields has been fully accumulated, and most of it has been delivered to the fields.

    定西专区领导重心转向备耕
    本报讯　据甘肃日报报道，甘肃定西专区各县在1956年12月内基本完成了转社和决算分配后，从地方党委到乡支部立即把领导重心转到了备耕工作方面。由地委书记、县委书记和其它负责干部带领大批干部深入农村，推动当前生产。据专区机关和会宁等六个县统计，这一期间就有六百九十二个干部下到农村工作。为预防干旱威胁，各地都突出地抓住了浇灌冬水和整地保墒的工作。靖远已灌冬水十一万零七百四十二亩，达水地总面积92.4％。永登、临洮灌冬水二十万亩，占应浇冬水面积二十五万亩的80％以上。渭源冬灌面积较去年增加了四千余亩。有条件的地方还继续兴修了小型水利工程。背冰扫雪也已普遍开展起来。渭源县副县长王继周亲自背雪带动了群众，全县十四个乡已积雪上地三千零一十五亩。
    积肥送粪运动搞得较前更起劲了。据在临洮二十个乡了解：夏田肥料已经全部攒足，大部分都送到了地里。
