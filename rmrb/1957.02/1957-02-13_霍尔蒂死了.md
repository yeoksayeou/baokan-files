Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Miklós Horthy, the fascist dictator of Hungary before liberation, died of illness in Portugal on February 9th. From 1919 to 1944, Horthy was the bloody ruler of Hungary. Relying on imperialist assistance, he strangled Hungary's first regime led by the working class in 1919, restored the monarchy, and made himself regent. During World War II, Horthy made Hungary a vassal of Hitler. At the end of 1944, when Soviet troops defeated the Nazi German forces and entered Hungary, Horthy fled abroad. He was eighty-nine years old at the time of his death.
