Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, 30th - (Delayed) Before leaving Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, on January 29th, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a farewell speech to the Nepalese people on Nepal Radio, the full text of which is as follows: Dear Nepalese friends:

	In the past four days, we have realized a long-held wish – to personally visit our close neighbor, Nepal, and get to know the Nepalese people, who have had friendly relations with the Chinese people for over a thousand years. Although our stay here has been very short, thanks to the kind concern of His Majesty King Mahendra and the proper arrangements made by Prime Minister Acharya and the Kingdom Government, we have had the opportunity to understand many aspects of Nepalese life.

	The impressions we have gained here are very profound and will remain in our memories forever. The beauty of Nepal's mountains and rivers and the richness of its land amazed us almost at first glance. The long-standing culture of the Nepalese people has filled us with admiration. Whether it is in Kathmandu, known as the City of Glory, in Lalitpur, known as the City of Beauty, or in Bhaktapur, known as the City of Devotion, the art created by the Nepalese people fully demonstrates the wisdom of the heart and the skill of the hand.

	However, among all things, what impressed us the most was the people of Nepal. The Nepalese people love freedom and independence; they are industrious, brave, warm, and hospitable. We have seen your efforts to build the country and your dedication to maintaining peace. We firmly believe that the cause undertaken by such people will surely succeed.

	In the past few days, the deep friendship shown to us by the Nepalese people has particularly moved us. I want to express my heartfelt thanks to you once again. At the same time, I want to say again that the Chinese people will always be the loyal friends of the Nepalese people. Our two peoples are not only united by history and geography, but also by our common goals of supporting national independence, maintaining world peace, and conducting friendly cooperation. On the road to this common goal, we will always need to help each other. We will also always need to cooperate with all countries that share the same goals.

	China and Nepal are linked by the great Himalayas with a common border of nearly a thousand kilometers. The friendly cooperation between our two countries is of great significance to the peace of this vast region. We are very pleased that India, another great country also located on the edge of the Himalayas, maintains close relations with both China and Nepal. Our three countries have unanimously declared that we will steadfastly adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence – Panchsheel – as the guiding principles for our relations. This unity of our three countries can undoubtedly guarantee the peace of this region and have a positive impact on the peace of the entire Asia and the world.

	When we talk here about the desire for lasting world peace, we are not just talking about a beautiful fantasy. The situation of our times gives us reason to be confident that our common desire can be realized through our joint efforts. The Five Principles have been accepted by more and more countries, and the Bandung Spirit is becoming increasingly rooted in people's hearts. Our gathering here proves that the era in which imperialist forces could arbitrarily prevent the approach and friendship between the peoples of various countries has passed. We all have the determination to safeguard world peace, and as long as we remain vigilant, persist in the struggle to maintain peace, and unite all the forces of peace in the world, no force can drag us into war.

	Dear friends, we are about to leave now. Although we regret that we cannot be together often, our hearts are always together. Through Prime Minister Acharya's visit to China and our visit to Nepal this time, the Chinese and Nepalese people have felt closer. The friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese peoples will continue to grow. Let us always advance side by side!

	Dear friends, I wish you eternal victory!
	Nepal – Chini Bhai Bhai (Nepalese and Chinese people are brothers)!
	Shanti Zindabad (Long live peace)!
	Jai Nepal (Victory to Nepal)!

The association president Subarna Shum Shere Jung Bahadur Rana delivered a speech welcoming the guests. Then, Premier Zhou Enlai gave a reply.

    中尼人民的心永远亲近
    周总理向尼泊尔的告别词
    新华社加尔各答30日电　（迟到）周恩来总理1月29日离开尼泊尔首都加德满都以前，在尼泊尔广播电台发表了对尼泊尔人民的告别词，全文如下：亲爱的尼泊尔朋友们：
    在过去的四天中，我们实现了一个久已存在的宿愿——亲自来看一看我们亲近的邻邦尼泊尔，结识一下同中国人民已经有千年以上友好关系的尼泊尔人民。虽然我们在这里逗留的时间十分短促，但是，由于马亨德拉国王陛下的亲切关怀，由于阿查里雅首相阁下和王国政府的妥善安排，我们已经得到机会了解了尼泊尔生活的许多方面。
    我们在这里所得到的印象是十分深刻的，它们将永远留在我们的记忆中。尼泊尔山川的美丽和土地的富饶几乎在第一瞥就引起了我们的赞叹。尼泊尔人民的悠久的文化，更使我们钦佩不已。无论是在被称为光荣之城的加德满都，在被称为美丽之城的拉利特普尔，还是在被称为虔信至诚的巴克塔普尔，尼泊尔人民所创造的艺术，充分的表现了心的智慧和手的灵巧。
    然而，在所有一切中间，给我们最深刻印象的还是尼泊尔的人民。尼泊尔人民热爱自由、热爱独立，尼泊尔人民是勤劳、勇敢、热情、好客的人民。我们看到了你们对建设国家的努力和对维护和平的忠诚。我们深信这样的人民所从事的事业是一定会成功的。
    在过去几天中，尼泊尔人民对于我们所表现的深情厚谊，特别使我们感动。我要再一次向你们表示衷心的感谢。同时，我也要再一次说，中国人民将永远是尼泊尔人民的忠实的朋友。我们两国人民不但是被历史和地理团结在一起的，而且也是被我们支持民族独立、维护世界和平、进行友好合作的共同目标团结在一起的。在走向这个共同目标的道路上，我们永远需要互相帮助。我们也永远需要同一切具有共同目标的国家合作。
      中国和尼泊尔是由伟大的喜马拉雅山以将近一千公里的共同边界联结在一起的。我们两国之间的友好合作对于这一片广大地区的和平具有重大的意义。使我们感到十分欣慰的是，同样位在喜马拉雅山边的一个伟大的国家——印度同中国和尼泊尔都保持着亲密的关系。我们三个国家一致宣布坚定不移的以和平共处的五项原则——潘查希拉作为指导我们之间的关系的准则。我们三个国家的这种团结，无疑的可以使得这个地区的和平得到保证，而且可以对整个亚洲和世界的和平起着良好的影响。
    当我们在这里谈到对于世界的持久和平的愿望的时候，我们并不只是在谈一种美丽的幻想。我们所处的时代的形势使我们有理由确信，我们的共同愿望是可以经过我们的共同努力而实现的。五项原则已经被越来越多的国家所接受，万隆精神正在越来越深入人心。我们在这里聚会就证明了帝国主义势力能够任意阻止各国人民之间的接近和友好的时代已经过去了。我们都有着保卫世界和平的决心，只要我们提高警惕，坚持维护和平的斗争，团结世界的一切和平的力量，那就没有任何力量可以把我们拖入战争。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们现在就要离别了。虽然我们因为不能常在一起而感到遗憾，但是我们的心是永远在一起的。通过阿查里雅首相在中国的访问，通过我们这次在尼泊尔的访问，中国人民和尼泊尔人民是已经感到靠得更近了。中尼两国人民的友谊将会不断地得到增长。让我们永远并肩前进吧！
    亲爱的朋友们，祝你们永远胜利！
    尼泊尔——秦尼巴依巴依（尼中人民是兄弟）！
    香地津达巴（和平万岁）！
    贾尼泊尔　（尼泊尔胜利）！
    据新华社加德满都电　（迟到）1月28日下午，周恩来总理参加了尼泊尔亚洲关系及国际事务协会举行的招待会。协会会长苏伯纳·休姆·谢勒·中格·巴哈杜尔·拉纳致词欢迎客人。接着，周恩来总理致答词。
