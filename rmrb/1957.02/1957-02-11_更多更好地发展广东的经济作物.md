More and Better Development of Guangdong's Economic Crops
Xiao Juncheng Wu Erxiang

Guangdong Province is located in the tropics and subtropics, with a warm climate and abundant rainfall. The average temperature is around 22 to 25 degrees Celsius. Except for areas north of Qujiang County where frost and snow are occasionally seen, other areas are "green all year round without snow in the three winter months." These are unique and advantageous conditions for Guangdong to develop economic crops. According to statistics, there are no less than several thousand kinds of economic crops in the province, including world-renowned fruits such as lychees, bananas, pineapples, and citrus fruits; silkworms and mulberries that can be harvested seven or eight times a year and tea that can be picked all year round; sugarcane production that accounts for half of the country's mainland output; and flax planted using winter fallow fields. In addition, there are many precious tropical crops such as rubber, oil palm, quinine, sisal hemp, coconut, coffee, cocoa, pepper, and lemongrass. Developing Guangdong's economic crops is of particular and significant importance to meeting the needs of national industrial construction and people's lives.

In the past few years, the production of economic crops in Guangdong Province has greatly developed. In 1956, the province's economic crop cultivated land area reached more than 7.47 million mu, exceeding the pre-war peak level by one-third, and increasing by about four times compared with 1949. Among them, the cultivated land area of five major industrial raw material crops, such as sugarcane, jute, silkworm, tea, and flue-cured tobacco, was about 2.2 million mu in 1956, an expansion of 1.26 million mu compared with 1949; the total output increased by more than four times. Sugarcane alone produced more than 9.4 million dan of various types of sugar in 1955, supplying the needs of people in 21 provinces; Guangdong's fruits and vegetables, in addition to meeting the needs of people in major cities across the country, also have a large number of exports, earning foreign exchange to support national construction.

The production of economic crops in Guangdong Province is still far from meeting the requirements of national industrial construction and people's lives. Whether from a national perspective or from the province's specific conditions, Guangdong has the necessity and the possibility to provide more and better economic crop products to meet the needs of the country and the people. According to Guangdong Province's preliminary plan, by 1962, the province's economic crop cultivated land area will be developed from the current 7.47 million mu to about 20 million mu; among them, perennial economic crops, such as sugarcane, silkworm, sea island cotton, rubber, sisal hemp, oil palm, coconut, coffee, lemongrass, ramie, castor, tea, citrus, banana, pineapple, and various medicinal materials, will be developed from the current 3 million mu to more than 14 million mu; the total output value of economic crop production in the province will increase three times compared with 400 million yuan in 1955.

It is possible to realize this plan. In addition to the superior natural conditions conducive to the development of economic crops, the people of Guangdong also have rich experience in cultivating economic crops; at the same time, there are a large number of barren hills and wasteland that can be utilized (it is estimated that there are at least more than 30 million mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed in the province). From 1956 to 1962, the province plans to reclaim more than 10 million mu of wasteland, which will mainly be used to develop economic crops. In the past few years, on the basis of gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, annual increases in grain production have been achieved, fundamentally changing the historical situation of grain shortages in Guangdong Province. In 1956, the province's total grain output reached 24 billion jin, with an average of about 600 jin per person. The victory of cooperation and the improvement of the grain situation have created a solid foundation for Guangdong Province to further develop economic crops. Therefore, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that in the next six years, from the existing 50 million mu of grain cultivated land, on the premise of increasing the yield per unit area, 5 million mu of land will be gradually adjusted to grow economic crops. Guangdong's existing arable land for grain has great potential for increased production. The yield of high-yield and low-yield areas differs by several times. If the number of multiple cropping can be increased, three crops a year can be promoted, and the level of cultivation technology can be improved, grain production can still be guaranteed to increase year by year after reducing the cultivated land area by 5 million mu.

This is a great plan, which points out a beautiful and prosperous prospect for the people of Guangdong. In the near future, in the deserted areas of Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula, tropical crops such as rubber, coconut, coffee, and sea island cotton will be planted everywhere; the sugarcane in the Pearl River Delta will also be extensively planted on the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island. Recently, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has established nine disease-free citrus nurseries in nine counties and cities including Chaoyang and Haikou, which will be able to cultivate more than 2 million citrus seedlings by 1960; the famous Chaozhou citrus will be planted all over the province. At that time, hundreds of new factories will be established to process these products. The lives of farmers will be greatly improved. It is estimated that by 1962, the average household of farmers in the province will increase their income by about 150 yuan due to the development of economic crop production.

In realizing this plan, there are some issues that need to be paid attention to. Years of experience have proven that developing economic crops on the basis of ensuring increased grain production is an unshakable policy for the development of agricultural production in Guangdong Province. In the past, especially in the first half of 1956, due to one-sided emphasis on grain production, some land originally planted with economic crops was inappropriately converted to grain; too much effort was concentrated on grain production, resulting in a sharp decline in the production of many economic crops. However, at present, some areas have shown a tendency to neglect grain production after criticizing the one-sided view of grain, and demand to greatly compress the area of grain production and switch to economic crops, which is also one-sided. Grain production is the foundation of the agricultural economy. Although Guangdong's grain situation has greatly improved, the province's average per capita is only about 600 jin, which is not enough to further improve people's lives. Therefore, there must be a correct ratio between grain and economic crop production.

Economic crop production has the characteristics of large investment, high labor demand, high fertilizer consumption, high technical and commercial requirements, and slow returns (especially perennial economic crops). Therefore, when developing economic crops, based on past experience and lessons, not only should natural conditions be considered, but more importantly, economic conditions should be considered. A comprehensive consideration must be given to labor, capital, fertilizer, transportation, sales, processing, prices, and technical conditions. In the past, some areas neglected these factors, resulting in insufficient labor, lack of fertilizer, or difficulties in transportation, processing, and sales, causing considerable losses. Therefore, the Provincial People's Committee believes that the current priority should be to consider expanding the planting area on the basis of increasing the yield per unit area. At present, the yield per unit area of economic crops is still very low. For example, sugarcane, the high-yield area produces more than 20,000 jin per mu, while the average yield in the province is only about 6,000 jin; the high-yield area of jute is more than 1,000 jin per mu, while the average yield in the province is less than 300 jin. This shows that there is still great potential for increasing the yield per unit area. The expansion of the planting area of economic crops must be carried out with caution. Areas with conditions can develop more, and areas without conditions should first create conditions to lay the foundation for future development.

While developing economic crops, attention should also be paid to improving quality and increasing varieties. In recent years, although various major economic crops have developed greatly, small and sporadic economic crops have shown a shrinking phenomenon. For example, local specialties such as water chestnuts, straw mushrooms, Buddha's hand, and fruit sugarcane have been greatly reduced. The famous water chestnuts (ie,荸荠) in Haizhong Township, Nanhai County, have almost become extinct; the famous Buddha's hand (medicinal material) in the first and second districts of Gaoyao used to have an annual output of more than 500,000 jin, but now only 500 jin remain. The decline in quality is even more serious. For example, tea, although the output has increased, the amount of first and second grade tea has greatly decreased. Pineapples in Shuixi Township, Panyu County, used to be mostly six or seven jin and four or five jin each, but now there are no six or seven jin ones, and the four or five jin ones only account for 0.5%. The main reason is that in the past few years, the agricultural leadership departments only managed the main economic crops and rarely intervened in the small ones; they managed the quantity but neglected the quality. For example, there are more than 100 kinds of fruits, but the agricultural department only manages the four major fruits such as bananas, pineapples, lychees, and citrus, and lets the others fend for themselves. If this serious situation is not corrected, it will result in the extinction and degradation of many varieties, affecting farmers' income and the reputation of the market. Of course, solving this problem requires multiple approaches. In addition to strengthening leadership, prices that are too low should be adjusted and raised, and the policy of high quality and high price should be firmly implemented to overcome the phenomenon of downgrading and price suppression; sporadic economic crops suitable for individual management by members should be encouraged for individual management; the labor remuneration in agricultural cooperatives should be reasonable, and the main reason for the decline in tea quality is unreasonable labor remuneration. In addition, issues such as the evaluation of economic crops for joining the community, fertilizers, and loans also need to be properly resolved, otherwise, they will all have an adverse impact on the development of economic crops.

    更多更好地发展广东的经济作物
    肖俊城　吴尔祥
    广东省地处热带和亚热带，气候温暖，雨量充沛，平均温度在摄氏二十二度到二十五度左右，除了曲江县以北地区偶见霜雪以外，其他地区“三冬无雪，四季常青”。这是广东发展经济作物特具的优越条件。据统计，全省的经济作物不下数千种，其中有闻名中外的荔枝、香蕉、菠萝、柑桔等水果，有一年可以采摘七、八次的蚕桑和终年可采的茶叶，有占全国大陆产量一半的蔗糖生产，有利用冬闲田种植的亚麻。此外，还有许多珍贵的橡胶、油棕、金鸡纳霜、剑麻、椰子、咖啡、可可、胡椒、香茅草等热带作物。发展广东省的经济作物，对满足国家工业建设和人民生活的需要，具有特殊重大的意义。
    广东省的经济作物生产，过去几年已经有了很大的发展。1956年，全省经济作物的耕地面积已达到七百四十七万多亩，超过战前最高水平的三分之一，比1949年增加了四倍左右。其中甘蔗、黄麻、蚕桑、茶叶、烤烟等五种主要工业原料作物，1956年的耕地面积约有二百二十余万亩，比1949年扩大了一百二十六万亩；总产量增加了四倍多。单是甘蔗，1955年制成各种食糖九百四十多万担，供应了二十一个省份人民的需要；广东的水果、蔬菜，除了供应全国各大城市人民需要外，还有大量的出口，换取外汇，支援国家建设。
    广东省经济作物的生产，还远不能满足国家工业建设和人民生活的要求。不论是从全国的角度或是从本省具体条件来看，广东都有必要而且有可能提供更多更好的经济作物产品，以满足国家和人民的需要。根据广东省的初步规划，到1962年，全省经济作物的耕地面积要从现在的七百四十七万余亩，发展到两千万亩左右；其中属于多年生的经济作物，如甘蔗、蚕桑、海岛棉、橡胶、剑麻、油棕、椰子、咖啡、香茅、苎麻、蓖麻、茶叶、柑桔、香蕉、菠萝，以及各种药材等，将从现在的三百多万亩发展到一千四百多万亩；全省经济作物生产总产值，将比1955年的四亿元增长三倍。
    实现这个规划是可能的。除了有利于发展经济作物的优越的自然条件外，广东人民还有栽培经济作物的丰富经验；同时，还有大量的荒山荒地可以利用（全省估计至少有三千万亩以上的荒地可以开垦）。从1956年到1962年全省准备开荒一千多万亩，这些新垦的荒地，主要是用来发展经济作物。过去几年，在逐步实现农业社会主义改造的基础上，获得了粮食的逐年增产，根本改变了广东省历史上历年缺粮的情况。1956年全省粮食总产量已达到二百四十亿斤，平均每人有六百斤左右。合作化的胜利和粮食情况的好转，为广东省进一步发展经济作物创造了坚实的基础。因此，中共广东省委决定，在今后的六年中，从现有的五千万亩粮食耕地中，在提高单位面积产量的前提下，逐步地再调剂出五百万亩土地改种经济作物。广东省粮食的现有耕地增产潜力还很大，高产和低产的产量相差几倍，如果能够增加复种次数，推广一年三熟，提高耕作技术水平，在减少五百万亩的耕地面积后，还可以保证粮食的逐年增产。
    这是一个伟大的规划，它向广东人民指出了美丽、繁荣的前景。不久的将来，在海南岛和雷州半岛上的荒无人烟的地带，将遍植橡胶、椰子、咖啡、海岛棉等热带作物；珠江三角洲的甘蔗也将大量扩种到雷州半岛和海南岛。最近省农业厅已在潮阳、海口等九个县、市建立了九个柑桔无病苗圃，到1960年将可以培植柑桔苗木二百多万株；著名的潮州柑桔将遍布全省。那时，成百个新的工厂将建立起来，为这些产品进行加工。农民生活将大大提高，预计到1962年，全省平均每户农民将由于发展经济作物生产而增加收入一百五十元左右。
    在实现这个规划中，有一些问题是需要加以注意的。几年来的经验证明：在保证粮食增产的基础上发展经济作物，是广东省发展农业生产不能动摇的方针。过去，特别是1956年上半年，由于片面强调粮食生产，不适当地把一些原来种植经济作物的土地改种粮食；过多地集中力量在粮食生产上，使不少经济作物严重减产。但是，目前有些地区在批判片面的粮食观点后，又出现忽视粮食生产的倾向，要求大大压缩粮食生产面积，改种经济作物，这同样也是片面的。粮食生产是农业经济的基础。广东的粮食情况虽已有很大的好转，但是全省每人平均才只有六百斤左右，要进一步提高人民生活，这是不够的。因此，粮食和经济作物生产必须要有正确的比例。
    经济作物生产具有投资大、需要劳动力多、用肥多、技术性和商品性高，而收效慢（特别是多年生经济作物）的特点。因此，在发展经济作物的时候，根据过去的经验和教训，不但要考虑到自然条件，更重要的是要考虑经济条件。必须从劳力、资金、肥料、运输、销路、加工、价格和技术条件等方面加以全盘考虑。过去有些地区由于忽视了这些因素，因而发生劳动力不足，或是肥料缺乏，或是运输、加工、销路等困难，造成不少的损失。因此，省人民委员会认为当前首先要在提高单位面积产量的基础上来考虑扩大种植面积。目前经济作物的单位面积产量还是很低的，比如甘蔗，高产的每亩产二万多斤，而全省平均产量只有六千斤左右；黄麻高产的每亩有一千多斤，而全省平均产量还不到三百斤。这说明提高单位面积产量的潜力还很大。扩大经济作物的种植面积，必须慎重从事，有条件的地方可以多发展，没有条件的，应当首先创造条件，为今后发展打下基础。
    在发展经济作物的同时还应该注意提高质量，增加品种。几年来，各种主要经济作物虽有很大的发展，但小宗的零星的经济作物却有萎缩的现象。比如马蹄、草菇、佛手、果蔗等土特产目前已大大减少。著名的南海县海中乡的马蹄（即荸荠），几乎已经绝种；著名的高要一、二区的佛手（药材），过去年产量五十多万斤，现在只剩下五百斤了。品质下降的情况更为严重。比如茶叶，产量虽增加了，但一、二级茶大大减少了。番禺县水西乡的菠萝，过去很多是六、七斤和四、五斤一个，现在六、七斤的一个都没有了，四、五斤一个的也只占0.5％。主要原因是这几年来，农业领导部门只管主要的经济作物，小宗的很少过问；管了产量，忽视了质量。比如水果有一百多种，农业部门只管香蕉、菠萝、荔枝、柑桔等四大果品，其它就让它自生自灭。这种严重情况如果不加纠正，结果就会导致许多品种的绝种和退化，影响农民收入和市场的声誉。当然解决这个问题是要从多方面着手，除了加强领导外，价格偏低的要调整提高，坚决贯彻优质优价政策，克服压级压价的现象；适宜于社员个人经营的零星的经济作物，要鼓励社员个人经营；农业合作社劳动计酬要合理，茶叶质量下降的主要原因就是劳动计酬不合理造成的。此外，如经济作物评价入社、肥料、贷款等问题，也都需要妥善解决，不然，都会给发展经济作物带来不利的影响。
