    Great Cooperation
    Mikhail Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

    Seven years have passed since that significant day when the Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in Moscow. These past years have vividly demonstrated the great significance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty for the peoples of our two countries and its remarkable international significance.

    The friendship between the peoples of our two countries has existed since ancient times, but since the establishment of the free, independent, and unprecedentedly united great nation of the People's Republic of China next to the Soviet Socialist Republics, the friendship between the two peoples has become particularly sincere and intimate. At this time, the People's Republic of China has established a people's democratic dictatorship, uniting the broad masses of the people at home to jointly build a socialist society.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have completely eliminated the old world of oppression, enslavement, and exploitation of man by man in their own country, established a socialist society, smoothly developed their economy and culture, and are moving forward towards communism. The working people of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the long-tested vanguard—the Communist Party of China—are eliminating past backwardness, working hard to turn China into a great socialist industrial power, and are successfully realizing socialist construction.

    The fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is so solid, so lasting, and so unshakable because the great peoples of our two countries are fighting for a common cause. It is the first time in the world that the peoples of two countries like ours, with a combined population of almost one-third of humanity, have united their destinies so closely in such a fraternal alliance. The alliance between our two countries is unprecedented in its nature and purpose.

    There have been many alliances between countries in the history of capitalism, including alliances between great powers. However, such alliances have never been, and cannot be, a solid alliance between the peoples themselves. Usually, it is a military alliance built on a temporary coincidence of certain goals and interests between countries, and it is directed against other countries. Such alliances can only be temporary and unstable; they quickly disintegrate, and old allies often become enemies. The aggressive groups of today, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact, are such alliances.

    The alliance between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union has nothing in common with such alliances. It is an alliance between two great socialist countries built on complete equality, the coincidence of goals and interests of the two peoples with world-historical significance, and it is a fraternal alliance between the peoples of two great countries. At the same time, this alliance is not directed against any other country, nor does it threaten any country. On the contrary, this alliance not only conforms to the interests of the peoples of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, but also, without exception, conforms to the interests of all peace-loving countries and peoples. This alliance is a strong pillar of peace, security, and peaceful cooperation among all countries.

    The sincere and profound friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is built on the basis of full trust, mutual understanding, and close cooperation between our two countries. This friendship is developing and consolidating day by day. The ideological unity between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and the common cause of world-historical significance in building socialist and communist societies, unite the peoples of China and the Soviet Union into an indestructible fraternal alliance. The complete agreement of views between our two great parties is particularly manifested in the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

    Sino-Soviet friendship is accelerating the pace of progress in both countries. This friendship is of great significance to both countries, and its role in consolidating the world socialist system is inestimable. Our friendship has an increasing influence on the development of the international situation. It restrains the aggressive ambitions of the bellicose imperialist groups and vigorously supports and inspires the growing forces of peace.

    The friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, which is strengthening the unity of the countries in the socialist camp, is the most important factor for world peace. This friendship arms the peace-loving people of all countries in the world with confidence in a bright future.

    Comrade Mao Zedong once wrote: "The friendship between the great peoples of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable because our friendship is based on... the great principle of internationalism...

    "Obviously, the power generated by our friendship is infinite and truly invincible.

    "Let all imperialist aggressors and warmongers tremble before our great friendship!"

    The positive results of the joint efforts of our socialist countries in the struggle against imperialist aggression, against colonialism, and for lasting peace and the security of all peoples cannot be overestimated. If the people of all countries are able to enjoy the fruits of peaceful life today without suffering the disasters of war and massacre, then they should greatly appreciate the strength of the Sino-Soviet alliance. The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is an insurmountable obstacle in the path of imperialist aggressors.

    The working people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the world will continue to vigilantly monitor all the plots and tricks of the imperialists, who will not relax their sabotage activities for a minute.

    Answering the clamor and war cries of propaganda from the imperialist camp is the confident and firm voice calling for peace, truth, and justice that resounds throughout the world. This powerful voice from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China cannot be suppressed by any clamor from the warmongers. When people hear this voice of the powerful advocates of peace, their hearts will be at ease, and their confidence in tomorrow will be strengthened.

    Sino-Soviet friendship, the indestructible unity of the socialist countries, is the guarantee of lasting peace and the hope of mankind.

    The events of international life in recent years have made us deeply convinced of this. The joint efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union extinguished the flames of war in Korea in 1953, which seriously threatened the cause of peace. The contribution of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the struggle for peace in Korea should be seen not only as great support for the Korean people but also as support for the entire peace camp.

    In 1954, thanks to the joint efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries and peoples, peace was restored in Indochina. In the same year, the People's Republic of China and India formulated the world-famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different political and social systems. These principles, which have been supported by the Soviet Union and many other peace-loving countries, are powerful weapons in the struggle for world peace.

    The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have consistently adhered to a common position in resolving various important international issues. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China firmly opposed imperialist aggression against Egypt, and also opposed the attempts of international reactionaries to restore the fascist system in Hungary and establish a source of war in Europe.

    Sino-Soviet friendship plays a positive role in the economic and cultural development of both countries. The mutual assistance and comprehensive cooperation between our two countries have achieved remarkable results. It is well known that the Soviet Union is helping the People's Republic of China build industrial enterprises and supplying China with necessary goods. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also obtaining goods necessary for the Soviet economy and the Soviet people from China on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    When the Soviet people think of the achievements of the fraternal Chinese people in the past few years, they cannot help but be filled with joy and admiration. These achievements are great, and they have brought fundamental changes to the lives of the Chinese working people.

    The Soviet people built their own powerful country through tenacious labor. Therefore, the extremely joyous feelings of our Chinese brothers when they celebrate the birth of some new industrial enterprises are fully understood and deeply felt by the Soviet people.

    We know from our own experience that industrialization requires a great deal of sacrifice for a country that is economically backward compared to other countries. It is undoubtedly not easy to build socialism under such conditions. It is necessary to practice thrift, endure temporary hardships and difficulties. However, when the blast furnace built with their own hands produces iron, when the first car rolls off the assembly line of the car factory built with their own hands, every patriot can see at that moment that the sacrifices and temporary hardships are not in vain, and he has been compensated a hundredfold.

    The Soviet people, especially our working class, are proud that they have made a small contribution to the great program of realizing China's industrialization. This pride does not come from wanting to hear praise, but from the pure heart of a creator who has done a good deed for his best friend. The Soviet people fully understand that the benefits we both receive from economic cooperation, trade, and fraternal mutual assistance are also of great significance for the further development of the Soviet economy.

    The Soviet people, especially the collective farm peasants, are also proud of the remarkable victories of the Chinese peasants, who make up the majority of the Chinese population. Soviet agriculture has achieved great success on the road to socialism. These achievements, especially in the rapid expansion of grain production, can not only meet our domestic grain needs but also provide necessary assistance to fraternal countries in need of grain. The Chinese peasants have also embarked on the socialist path pointed out by the Communist Party of China with unprecedented enthusiasm. The collectivization of agriculture has been basically completed. This is the most significant change in the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants, opening up broad prospects for a prosperous life for the first time for Chinese peasants. Last year, the Chinese peasants already felt the benefits brought to them by collectivization. Despite the severe natural disasters that affected farmland last year, agricultural output still increased compared to the previous year.

    Thanks to the correct policies of the Communist Party of China and its tireless concern for the people, the lives of the Chinese working people are constantly improving, and their material well-being and cultural level are also constantly improving. The improvement of life more eloquently than any words shows the working people that they have not made a mistake in choosing the socialist path of development, and that a happier future awaits them.

    The Soviet people cannot but give due respect to the foresight and wisdom of the Communist Party of China, which resolutely follows the principles of Marxism-Leninism and creatively applies these principles to solve the political and economic problems of its own country. The Communist Party of China, with its fruitful activities, makes outstanding contributions to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism and enriches the experience of the international workers' movement. This once again demonstrates the strength and creative spirit of Marxism-Leninism. The 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held last September, pointed out the program for the Chinese people to strive for the complete victory of socialism. This congress was an event of great historical significance.

    We Soviet people are happy to realize that we are advancing shoulder to shoulder with the great Chinese people along the bright road of socialism. Mutual assistance in building a new life has become a standard for both the Soviet and Chinese peoples. Our cultures, like giant rivers with abundant water, merge with each other, and the mutual exchange of cultural treasures enriches the spiritual lives of the peoples of our two countries.

    According to existing cultural agreements, dozens of delegations and many activists in the fields of science, literature, and art from our two countries visit each other every year. Thousands of Chinese university students and graduate students are studying in the Soviet Union. Soviet youth are also beginning to go to the People's Republic of China to study. Soviet science and culture are enriching themselves with the achievements of Chinese culture. In the past six years, the Soviet Union has published 370 works by Chinese writers in Russian, with a total of about 20 million copies. The works of Chinese writers have been translated into more than 30 national languages of the Soviet Union.

    We welcome the future in rock-solid unity. The visit to the Soviet Union by the Chinese government delegation led by Comrade Zhou Enlai not long ago brought the peoples of our two countries one step closer. The Sino-Soviet talks in Moscow were conducted in a spirit of sincere friendship. The Moscow talks, as well as the Sino-Polish talks and the Sino-Hungarian talks held not long ago, undoubtedly greatly promoted the unity of the countries in the socialist camp. These talks are the practical realization of the unshakable Leninist spirit of proletarian internationalism.

    Our enemies never forget to see the division between the peoples of our two countries and our two countries. They always console themselves with the dream of splitting the socialist camp. It should be pointed out that this dream is as illusory as the dream of capitalist restoration in socialist countries! No matter how hard the dark forces try to prevent mankind from building a classless communist society, the ideal of friendship and great unity among the people of all countries has become a reality.

    The solidarity of the socialist countries, especially the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China, is the greatest victory of the international workers' movement. We will maintain and further develop this unity and carefully cherish it in order to crush all the sabotage plots of the enemy.

    Today, as we celebrate the seventh anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, together with the peoples of other socialist countries in Europe and Asia, are confidently and resolutely advancing in the forefront of building a new society, advancing under a red banner, fully confident in the strength and victory of our common cause.

    伟大的合作
    苏联共产党中央委员会书记　米·苏斯洛夫
    自从苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国在莫斯科签订了友好同盟互助条约那个意义重大的日子起，已经过去七年了。过去的这几年，鲜明地证明了苏中条约对于我们两国人民的伟大意义以及它的卓越的国际意义。
    我们两国人民之间的友谊自古以来就存在着，但是自从在苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的比邻成立了自由、独立、空前团结的伟大国家——中华人民共和国以后，两国人民的友谊就变得特别诚挚和亲切了。这时，中华人民共和国已建立起人民民主专政，把国内广大群众团结起来共同建设社会主义社会。
    在共产党的领导下，苏联人民在自己的国家里已彻底消灭了压迫、奴役、人剥削人的旧世界，建立起社会主义社会，顺利地发展着自己的经济和文化，并一往直前地走向共产主义。中华人民共和国的劳动人民，在久经考验的先锋队——中国共产党的领导下，正在消灭过去的落后现象，他们为了使中国变成一个伟大的社会主义工业强国而辛勤地劳动着，他们在顺利地实现社会主义建设。
    我们两国伟大人民都为共同的事业而奋斗，因此，苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民的兄弟般的友谊是如此牢固，如此持久和不可动摇。像我们这样人口合起来几乎占全人类三分之一的两个国家的人民，把自己的命运如此亲密地团结在这样一种兄弟的同盟中，在世界上还是首次。我们两国之间的同盟按其性质和目的来说，都是史无前例的。
    资本主义的历史上也有不少种国与国之间的同盟，其中也包括大国和大国之间的同盟。但是，这种同盟从来都不是，而且也不能是人民自己之间的巩固的同盟。通常，这是建筑在国与国之间的某些目的和利益临时一致上的军事同盟，而且是反对另外一些国家的。这种同盟永远只能是临时性的和不巩固的，这种同盟很快就会瓦解，同时旧的同盟者时常变成敌人，今天的侵略集团如北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约就是这样的同盟。
    中华人民共和国和苏联之间的同盟与这种同盟毫无共同之处。这是两个伟大的社会主义国家建筑在完全平等、两国人民的具有世界历史意义的目标和利益一致之上的同盟，这是两个伟大国家的人民之间的兄弟般的同盟。同时，这个同盟不是为了反对任何其他国家，它也不威胁任何国家的。相反，这个同盟不仅符合于中华人民共和国和苏联两国人民的利益，而且也毫无例外地符合于一切爱好和平的国家和人民的利益，这个同盟是所有国家之间的和平、安全和和平合作的强大支柱。
    苏中两国人民真诚、深厚的友谊建筑在我们两国充分信任、互相了解和密切合作的基础上。这种友谊在一天天地发展和巩固。苏联共产党和中国共产党基于马克思列宁主义原则上的思想一致，建设社会主义和共产主义社会的具有世界历史意义的共同事业，使中苏两国人民团结成为一个不可摧毁的兄弟同盟。我们两个伟大的党的观点的完全一致，特别表现在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会和中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上。
    苏中友谊在加快着两国前进的速度，这种友谊对两国具有巨大的意义，它对巩固世界社会主义体系的作用是无法估计的。我们的友谊对国际局势发展的影响也越来越大，它制止好战的帝国主义集团的侵略野心，大力支持和鼓舞着日益壮大的和平力量。
    日益加强社会主义阵营各国团结的人民中国和苏联的友谊是全世界和平的最重要的因素。这种友谊以对美好未来的信心来武装世界各国爱好和平的人民。
    毛泽东同志曾经写道：“伟大的中苏两国人民的友谊之所以是牢不可破的，因为我们的友谊是根据……伟大的国际主义的原则而建立起来的……。
    “显然，我们这种友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽和真正无敌的。
    “让一切帝国主义侵略者和战争贩子们在我们伟大的友谊面前颤抖吧！”
    对于我们社会主义国家在反对帝国主义侵略、反对殖民主义、争取持久和平和各国人民安全的斗争中共同努力所获得的那些良好的结果，是怎样估计也不会过高的。如果各国人民今天有可能享受和平生活的果实而不经受战争大屠杀的灾祸，那么他们对这一点应大大感激苏中同盟的强大力量。中苏两国的友谊是帝国主义侵略者道路上不可克服的障碍。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和世界各国的劳动人民今后仍将警惕地注视帝国主义分子的一切阴谋诡计，帝国主义分子一分钟也不放松它们的破坏活动。
    回答来自帝国主义阵营宣传的喧嚷和战争叫嚣的，是响彻全世界的要和平、真理和正义的充满信心的坚定的呼声。苏联和人民中国的这种强大呼声，是战争贩子的任何叫嚣都压不下去的。当人们听到强大的和平喉舌的这种呼声的时候，他们的心就会平静下来，他们对明天的信心就坚定起来了。
    苏中友谊、社会主义国家的不可摧毁的团结一致就是持久和平的保障，就是人类的希望。
    最近几年国际生活的事件使我们对这一点深信不疑。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的共同努力，在1953年扑灭了严重威胁和平事业的朝鲜的战火。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜争取和平斗争中的贡献，不仅应当看做是对朝鲜人民的巨大支援，而且也是对整个和平阵营的支援。
    1954年，由于越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国、苏联和其他爱好和平的国家和人民的共同努力，曾恢复了印度支那的和平。同年，中华人民共和国和印度制定了世界闻名的、政治和社会制度不同国家和平共处的五项原则。这些得到苏联和其他许多爱好和平的国家支持的原则，是争取世界和平斗争中的有力武器。
    苏联和中华人民共和国在解决各种重要的国际问题时，始终如一地坚持着共同一致的立场。苏联和中华人民共和国坚决反对帝国主义对埃及的侵略，也反对国际反动派在匈牙利恢复法西斯制度、在欧洲建立战争策源地的企图。
    苏中友谊对两国的经济和文化发展起着良好的作用。我们两国的互相帮助和全面合作已经获得了卓越的成果。大家知道，苏联正在帮助中华人民共和国建设工业企业，供应中国必需的货物。与此同时，苏联也在平等和互利的条件下从中国得到苏联经济和苏联人民所必需的货物。
    当苏联人想到兄弟的中国人民过去几年的成就的时候，就不能不充满愉快和赞美的心情。这些成就是伟大的，它们给中国劳动人民的生活带来了根本的变化。
    苏联人用顽强的劳动建成了自己的强大的国家，因此，中国兄弟当庆祝一些新的工业企业诞生时的那种极其愉快的心情，是苏联人完全了解而感到亲切的。
    我们根据自己的切身经验知道，在经济发展上落后于其他国家的一个国家，实现工业化是需要大量牺牲的。在这种条件下建成社会主义无疑是不容易的，要厉行节约，要忍受暂时的艰苦和困难。但是，当亲手建成的高炉出铁的时候，当亲手建成的汽车厂的传送带上开出第一辆汽车的时候，每一个爱国者在这个时刻都能看到：牺牲和暂时的艰苦不是徒劳的，他已得到了百倍的补偿。
    苏联人，首先是我们的工人阶级，以他们在实现中国工业化的伟大纲领的事业中有一份微薄的劳动而感到自豪。这种自豪感并不是出自想要听到赞扬，而是出自一个为最好的朋友做了好事的创造者的纯洁的心。苏联人十分了解，我们两国在经济合作、贸易和兄弟般互助方面互相得到的利益，对苏联经济的进一步发展也有巨大的意义。
    苏联人，首先是集体农庄农民，也以占中国居民大多数的中国农民的卓越胜利而感到自豪。苏联的农业在社会主义道路上达到了巨大的成就。这些成就，特别是在急剧扩大谷物生产方面的成就，不仅可以满足我国内部的粮食需要，而且还可以对需要粮食的兄弟国家给以必要的帮助。中国农民也以空前的热情走上了中国共产党所指出的社会主义道路。农业的合作化已基本上完成了。这是几万万中国农民生活中的最巨大的变化，在中国农民面前第一次打开了广阔的富裕生活的前景。去年，中国农民就已感到了合作化给他们带来的好处。尽管去年农田遭到了严重的自然灾害，农业产量还是比前年增加了。
    由于中国共产党的正确的政策和它对人民的不倦关怀，中国劳动人民的生活不断地改善，他们的物质福利和文化水平也不断提高。生活的改善比任何言语都更雄辩地向劳动人民说明，他们选择了社会主义的发展道路是没有错误的，在前面等候着他们的是更幸福的未来。
    苏联人对于中国共产党的远见和英明不能不给予应有的尊敬，中国共产党坚决地遵循着马克思列宁主义原则，并且创造性地运用这些原则来解决本国的政治和经济问题。中国共产党以其富有成效的活动给马克思列宁主义宝库以卓越的贡献，丰富了国际工人运动的经验。这再一次表明了马克思列宁主义的力量和创造精神。去年9月举行的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会向中国人民指出了争取社会主义完全胜利的纲领。这次代表大会是一项有巨大历史意义的事件。
    我们苏联人高兴地意识到我们同伟大的中国人民一起沿着社会主义的光明大道并肩前进。在建设新生活中的互相援助对苏联人和中国人都已经变成一项准则了。我们的文化像水量充分的巨流一样彼此汇合在一起了，文化珍品的互相交换使我们两国人民的精神生活更加丰富多采。
    根据现有的文化协定，我们两国每年有几十个代表团和许多科学和文学艺术界的活动家互相访问。几千名中国大学生和研究生在苏联学习。苏联的青年也开始到中华人民共和国去学习。苏联的科学和文化正在以中国文化的成就来丰富自己。在最近六年中苏联用俄文出版了三百七十种中国作家的作品，总数约达两千万册。中国作家的作品已译成苏联三十多种民族文字。
    我们在磐石般的团结一致中迎接未来。不久以前以周恩来同志为首的中国政府代表团的访问苏联，使我们两国人民更加接近了一步。莫斯科的苏中会谈是在真挚友好的精神下进行的。莫斯科的会谈以及不久以前举行的中波会谈和中匈会谈，无疑地大大促进了社会主义阵营各国的团结一致。这些会谈是不可动摇的列宁的无产阶级国际主义精神的实际的实现。
    我们的敌人念念不忘于看到我们两国人民和我们两个国家的分裂。他们总是以分裂社会主义阵营的梦想来自慰。应当指出，这个梦想就像梦想资本主义在社会主义国家中复辟一样地虚妄！不论黑暗势力怎样力图阻碍人类建成没有阶级的共产主义社会，可是关于各国人民友好和伟大团结的理想是变成现实了。
    社会主义国家的团结，首先是苏联和中国的永恒的、牢不可破的友谊，是国际工人运动的最伟大的胜利。我们将维护和更加发展这个团结，并且小心地爱护这个团结，以粉碎敌人的一切破坏阴谋。
    今天，当庆祝苏中友好同盟互助条约七周年的时候，苏中两国人民同欧亚两洲其他社会主义国家的人民一起，满怀信心地坚决地在建设新社会的前列前进，在一个红旗下前进，充分相信我们共同事业的力量和胜利。
