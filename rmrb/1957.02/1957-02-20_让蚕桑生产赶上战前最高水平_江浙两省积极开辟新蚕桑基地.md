Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th – In order to vigorously restore and develop silkworm production, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will increase new mulberry gardens by 790,000 mu this year. Zhejiang Province has already planted more than 160,000 mu, more than 40 million trees, which is 87% of the total area of mulberry gardens developed in the province over the past seven years, and will plant another 430,000 mu this spring. Jiangsu Province has opened up new mulberry gardens of 190,000 mu last winter and plans to this spring, an increase of nearly 70% compared with the seven years since liberation.

Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are the main sericulture bases in the country, the famous "silk hometowns." However, before liberation, they were severely damaged by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang. The area of mulberry gardens in Jiangsu decreased from 1.08 million mu before the war to 460,000 mu, and the total output of fresh cocoons accounted for only 20% of the pre-war total output. In the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas of Zhejiang, half of the more than 2.6 million mu of mulberry gardens were destroyed, and the output of fresh cocoons dropped by more than three-quarters.

In the seven years since liberation, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have actively cultivated old mulberry gardens, expanded new mulberry gardens, and increased the yield per unit area of mulberry gardens and cocoons. Last year, the total output of fresh cocoons in Jiangsu increased from more than 120,000 dan in 1949 to more than 230,000 dan, and Zhejiang more than doubled, but Zhejiang Province still only has 40.5% of the highest annual output before the war, and Jiangsu Province only has 35%. The low output of fresh cocoons affects farmers' income, and silk cannot meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets.

In order to rapidly and greatly increase the production of cocoons, the two provinces are actively opening up new sericulture bases under the principle of not encroaching on farmland. In addition to the Taihu Lake basin, Jiangsu is developing towards the mountainous areas of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, and the sandy wasteland of Xuzhou and Huaiyin areas. The number of cocoon-producing counties and cities has increased from 21 in the early days of liberation to 77 this year. Last year, more than 100,000 sericulture technicians were trained for agricultural cooperatives. Because a number of state-owned mulberry nurseries were established, the situation of relying entirely on other provinces for the supply of mulberry seedlings, which did not exist before liberation, was changed. Zhejiang expanded the original 37 silkworm-raising counties to 68. Farmers from Taihu Lake in western Zhejiang to Yandang Mountain in southern Zhejiang are taking planting mulberries and raising silkworms as a major part of developing diversified operations.

At present, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are combining spring rectification work, correctly handling the leftover problems of mulberry trees entering the cooperatives, improving the management of silkworm production by agricultural cooperatives, strengthening scientific research and technical guidance, and mobilizing farmers' enthusiasm for developing silkworm production from all aspects, striving to restore silkworm production to pre-war levels as soon as possible.

### 让蚕桑生产赶上战前最高水平  江浙两省积极开辟新蚕桑基地

    让蚕桑生产赶上战前最高水平
    江浙两省积极开辟新蚕桑基地
    新华社南京16日电　江苏、浙江两省为大力恢复和发展蚕桑生产，今年将增加新桑园七十九万亩。浙江省已栽桑十六万多亩，四千多万株，为过去七年全省发展桑园面积总和的87％，今年春天还要再栽桑四十三万多亩。江苏省去冬已经开辟和今春计划开辟的桑园也有十九万亩，新桑园面积比解放七年来增加近70％。
    江、浙两省是全国主要蚕桑基地，著名的“丝绸之乡”。但在解放前受到日本帝国主义和国民党的严重破坏，江苏桑园面积从战前的一百零八万亩减少到四十六万亩，鲜茧总产量只占战前总产量的20％。浙江杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）一带二百六十多万亩桑园毁坏一半，鲜茧产量下降了四分之三强。
    解放七年来，江、浙两省积极培育老桑园，拓植新桑园，提高桑园和蚕茧单位面积产量。江苏去年鲜茧总产量从1949年的十二万多担增加到二十三万多担，浙江则增加了一倍多，但浙江省仍只有战前最高年产量的40.5％，江苏省只有35％。鲜茧产量少影响到农民收入，丝绸远不能满足国内外市场需要。
    两省为了迅速和大量增产蚕茧，在不侵占粮田的原则下积极开辟新的蚕桑基地。江苏除太湖流域外，正向镇（江）、扬（州）山区和徐（州）、淮（阴）地区沙荒隙地发展，产茧县已从解放初期的二十一个县市增加到今年的七十七个县市。去年一年为农业社培养的养蚕技术人员有十万多人。因为建立了一批国营桑苗圃，改变了解放前没有桑苗圃，桑苗全部靠外省供应的情况。浙江把原有三十七个养蚕县扩大到六十八个，从浙西太湖到浙南雁荡山的农民，都把栽桑养蚕作为开展多种经营的一个主要内容。
    目前，江、浙两省正结合春季整社工作，正确处理桑树入社遗留问题，改善农业社对蚕桑生产的经营管理，加强科学研究和技术指导，从各方面调动农民发展蚕桑生产的积极性，争取尽快地把蚕桑生产恢复到战前水平。
