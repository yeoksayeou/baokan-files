Young People Reclaiming the Tropical Island Treasure
Huang Xiangqing, Zhou Wei

In the winter of 1955, as young people from all over North China rushed to the grasslands of Heilongjiang to reclaim land, young people from all over Guangdong Province also organized volunteer land reclamation teams, crossing the Qiongzhou Strait batch after batch to come to Hainan Island, known as the motherland's tropical treasure.

The first 298 young men and women from Guangzhou established the first collective farm in Chenxiu Township and the adjacent Dashan Township in Qiongshan County. He Shaoxiong, the farm's vice chairman, led us on a tour of the farm's cultivation site. This straightforward and talkative young man said during our visit: "Let people know that young people are reclaiming wasteland for the motherland not only in the frozen Heilongjiang, but also on this tropical island!"

The wasteland is boundless. Because typhoons are frequent, there are few tall trees here, and it is covered with weeds, thorns, and wind-resistant, low-lying shrubs. Now, a new scene has emerged: slopes and patches of lemongrass and coconut palms, clustered and shimmering in the sunlight; in the low-lying mountain depressions, there are sugar cane forests taller than people, and the long, wide leaves rustle against each other in the breeze.

He Shaoxiong excitedly told us that the government allocated us more than 10,000 mu of land at once, and also transferred tractors. The ground was covered with thorns and miscellaneous trees, and there were tree roots and stones underground, which made the tractor drivers frown. Over the past year, we have painstakingly reclaimed nearly 2,000 mu of land, of which more than 1,000 mu have been planted with lemongrass, and the rest with rice, vegetables, sugar cane, coconut palms, and potatoes. The land reclamation team has raised hundreds of cattle, sheep, and pigs, and the brick and tile kiln and tofu workshop have already started production. This year, a lemongrass oil processing factory will also be built...

Of the more than 290 farm members, only 40 to 50 are from the suburbs of Guangzhou, and the rest are workers, students, and unemployed young housewives. These hands that had never held a hoe before blistered their fingers on the first day, hurting so much that tears streamed down their faces. Many people moaned in bed because their shoulders and backs were so sore. But these hardships were expected, and everyone did not waver. When the blisters broke, they wrapped them with handkerchiefs, and padded their shoulders with towels to continue working.

The climate on Hainan Island is hot, and there are a lot of leeches in the swamps. When they first arrived, the girls were terrified of leeches and screamed and jumped around. Now, no one is afraid anymore. When they see a leech, they just flick it off, and if it sticks to their body, they pull it off and throw it away.

In March 1956, when the first batch of crops were planted, a severe drought struck. The Party and Communist Youth League branches promptly called on everyone to fight the drought. For more than a month, they took turns carrying water to irrigate the fields day and night. When the river dried up, they dug wells to get water. Finally, the wasteland grew crops. The yield also reached the general level of the local area.

The next day, we visited the animal husbandry sideline and vegetable areas. Three pigsties were built on a wide open space across a quiet small river. Several young girls were carrying buckets of water from the small river back to the pigsties. He Shaoxiong told us that the pig raising team leader, Liang Zhang, was originally a pig raising expert from the suburbs of Guangzhou; there are also some primary and secondary school students here, and they are all determined to become animal husbandry experts. Last October, this pig farm had already shipped sixty pigs to Guangzhou.

Going around the pigsties and along the small river are rows of melon and vegetable fields. Ruan Shaoqiong, the nineteen-year-old vegetable team leader, was squatting in front of a newly sprouted vegetable field, observing something intently. She told us that the sunshine on Hainan Island is stronger than on the mainland, especially in summer, and vegetables are very difficult to grow. In the past, vegetables had to be transported from the mainland. But because the farm members are diligent in irrigating, the vegetables here are growing fairly well (averaging 2,500 jin of vegetables per mu), but it is still far from the yield in the suburbs of Guangzhou. Ruan Shaoqiong said confidently: "I want to study the problem of growing vegetables in the tropics."

Ruan Shaoqiong, like many of the young people we visited, has great confidence in the land reclamation cause. When she graduated from junior high school, she wanted to be a tractor driver and go to Anshan Iron and Steel or Yumen; when she learned that the geological school was enrolling students, she wanted to be an exploration team member, a vanguard in building the motherland. At that time, she read the volunteer letter of the Beijing Youth Land Reclamation Team in the newspaper, and read Comrade Hu Yaobang's report on "Loving Hainan Island and Building Hainan Island," so she decided to come to Hainan Island. She wanted to fill the wasteland with rubber, sisal, and lemongrass, so that it could exert a huge force for the motherland's industrial construction.

One night in July, a typhoon from the Pacific Ocean attacked Hainan Island again. Ruan Shaoqiong crawled out of her sleep and called the team members to rescue the pig sheds. The farm members ignored the danger and rushed into the dark, vast wilderness like a sea, groping to the pigsties. At this time, everyone was soaked through by the heavy rain, but they still worked with the pig raising team members to drive piles, tie ropes, and stabilize the swaying pigsties. After the typhoon passed, none of the pigs were damaged, but Ruan Shaoqiong fell ill for a few days.

Before leaving the farm, we asked He Shaoxiong: "Is your hometown better or is it better here?" He pondered for a while and said, of course his hometown is better! But then he looked at the wilderness, stretched out his arms, and said in a loud voice, "This place is also so lovely! In a few years, our life will be better. By then, young people will be getting married in pairs!" (Attached pictures)

    开垦热带宝岛的年轻人
    黄向青　周围
    1955年冬天，当华北各地青年奔向黑龙江草原垦荒的时候，广东省各地的青年也纷纷组织了志愿垦荒队，一批一批地渡过琼州海峡，来到被誉为祖国热带的宝岛的海南岛上来。
    最初来自广州的二百九十八名男女青年，在琼山县陈秀乡和毗邻的大山乡境内建立了第一个集体农庄。农庄副主席何绍雄，带领着我们参观农庄的垦殖场地。这个直爽健谈的青年，在我们来访时说：“让人们知道，不仅在冰天雪地的黑龙江，在热带的岛上也有青年人在为祖国开垦荒地！”
    荒地是一望无垠的，因为台风频繁，这里很少高大的树木，到处丛生杂草荆棘和抗风力强的低矮灌木林。现在这儿已经出现了新的景象：坡连坡、片连片的香茅草、南椰，丛丛撮撮地在阳光下闪耀着；在低伏的山坳里，有着比人高的甘蔗林，微风吹过，又长又宽的叶片互相摩擦着，发出“沙沙”的喧声。
    何绍雄兴奋地对我们说，政府一次就划给我们一万多亩土地，还调来了拖拉机。地面上尽是荆棘杂树，地下还有树根石头，拖拉机手看了也皱眉头。一年来，我们辛苦地开垦了将近二千亩土地，其中一千多亩种上了香茅草，其他还种有水稻、蔬菜、甘蔗、南椰、薯类等。垦荒队养了成百只牛、羊和猪，砖瓦窑和豆腐房已经开始生产，今年还要建立香茅油加工工厂……。
    二百九十多个庄员中，只有四五十个人是来自广州郊区的，其他都是工人、学生和未就业的家庭青年妇女。这些没有抓过锄头的手，在第一天把指头都磨出了血泡，痛得眼泪直掉；许多人睡在床上哼哼不绝，因为他们肩膀腰骨酸痛得利害。但是这些苦处都是预料到的，大家并没有动摇，血泡破了就用手帕包起来，用毛巾把肩膊垫起来继续干。
    海南岛的气候炎热，水沼地里的蚂蝗特别多。刚来时，姑娘们看见蚂蝗都毛骨悚然，呱呱地乱叫乱跳；现在，谁也不怕了，看见蚂蝗就随手一泼，粘在身上就把它拉下来扔掉。
    1956年3月，当种上第一批庄稼时，严酷的旱灾降临了。党、团支部及时地号召大家突击抗旱，在一个多月里，不分昼夜地轮流挑水灌田；河水干了，就凿井取水。终于使荒地长出谷物来。产量也达到了当地一般的水平。
    第二天，我们参观了畜牧副业和蔬菜地区。在一条幽静的小河对岸的阔地上，建立了三座猪寮。几个年青的姑娘，挑着一担担的水从小河边飞奔回猪寮去。何绍雄对我们说，养猪组长梁章本来是广州市郊的养猪能手；这里还有些中小学生，他们都决心成为畜牧家。去年10月，这个猪场已经运往广州六十头猪。
    绕过猪寮，沿着小河走去，是一垅垅瓜菜田。十九岁的蔬菜组长阮少琼正蹲在一畦刚发芽的菜地前凝神观察着什么。她告诉我们，海南岛的阳光比大陆强烈，特别是夏天，蔬菜很难生长，过去，吃菜得从大陆运来。但是由于庄员勤于灌溉，这里的蔬菜生长得还算好（平均每亩收获蔬菜二千五百斤），不过，比起广州郊区的产量还是差得远。阮少琼很有信心地说：“我想研究研究热带种菜的问题。”
    阮少琼同我们访问过的许多年青人一样，对垦荒事业抱有很大的信心。她初中毕业时，曾经想当一名拖拉机手，想到鞍钢或者玉门去；当她知道地质学校招生，她又想当一名建设祖国尖兵的勘探队员。正在那个时候，她从报纸上读到了北京青年垦荒队的志愿书，读了胡耀邦同志“热爱海南岛，建设海南岛”的报告，于是她决定到海南岛来，她要让荒地种满橡胶、剑麻和香茅草，使它对祖国工业建设发挥巨大的力量。
    7月的一个晚上，太平洋上的台风又袭击海南岛了。阮少琼从睡梦中爬起来招呼队员们去抢救猪棚。庄员们顾不了危险，冲进了黑茫茫大海般的旷野，摸索着到了猪寮，这时大家全身里外都让暴雨打得湿透了，但还是跟养猪组的同志们一起打桩子，扎绳拉索，把摇动的猪寮稳固下来。台风过后，所有的猪没有受到损害，但阮少琼却病倒了几天。
    离开农庄之前，我们问过何绍雄：“家乡好还是这里好？”他沉思了一会儿说，家乡当然好！但他又望着旷野，伸开两臂，用洪亮的声音说，“这儿也实在太可爱了！再过几年，我们的生活会更好起来。那时候，年青人都要成对成双了！”（附图片）
