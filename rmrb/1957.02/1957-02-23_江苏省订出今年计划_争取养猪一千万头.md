Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangsu Province's pig population this year will increase from 6.5 million at the end of last year to 8.6 million, striving to reach 10 million. The head of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department of the Provincial Department of Agriculture said: Jiangsu Province is prepared to take some measures to solve the problems of pig feed, piglet breeding, and improving pig quality, overcome difficulties, and strive to achieve this production increase plan.

The solution to the pig feed problem mainly relies on the masses. As a result of the planning carried out by agricultural cooperatives this year, about 1.5 million mu of land will be planted with feed crops throughout the province. The province will also utilize 5% of the water surface to plant water hyacinth, water peanut, and other crops. These two items alone can produce 55 billion jin of refined, coarse, and succulent feed, which is sufficient to supply the feed for 10 million pigs. Agricultural cooperatives will restore a portion of rural product processing industries to increase refined feed.

Since the implementation of the "self-breeding and self-raising" policy, there are now 740,000 sows in the province, which can breed 8.9 million piglets throughout the year. The purchase of piglets from other places this year will be greatly reduced. In order to improve the quality of pigs, the province has designated three places, including Dalunzhuang in Taixian County, which produces good breeds of pigs, as breeding areas for fine breeds of pigs, and established three fine breed breeding stations to strengthen the guidance of agricultural cooperatives in cultivating fine breeds of pigs.

Jiangsu Province will provide free vaccinations against swine fever and swine erysipelas this year to prevent pig diseases.

    江苏省订出今年计划
    争取养猪一千万头
    据新华社南京电　江苏省今年养猪数量将从去年年底的六百五十万头增加到八百六十万头，争取达到一千万头。省农业厅畜牧兽医处负责人说：江苏省在解决猪的饲料和繁殖仔猪，提高猪的质量等方面准备采取一些措施，克服困难，争取实现这个增产计划。
    猪饲料问题的解决主要是依靠群众，今年各农业社进行规划的结果，全省约有一百五十万亩地种植饲料作物。全省再利用5％的水面种植水浮莲、水花生等作物，这两项就可出产精、粗、多汁饲料五百五十亿斤，足可供给一千万头生猪的饲料。农业社内恢复一部分农村产品的加工业，增加精饲料。
    从贯彻“自繁自养”方针以来，现在全省有母猪七十四万头，全年可繁殖苗猪八百九十万头。今年向外地购买的苗猪将大大减少。为了提高猪的质量，这个省已把出产良种猪的泰县大伦庄等三个地方划为良种猪培育区，建立了三个良种培育站，加强对农业社培育良种猪的指导工作。
    江苏省今年将免费注射猪瘟、猪丹毒疫苗，预防猪病。
