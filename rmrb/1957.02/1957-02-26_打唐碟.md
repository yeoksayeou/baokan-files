    Hitting the "Tang Die"
    Wang Yi, Duan Yuehua

    "Tang Die" is a Jingpo word, meaning target. Hitting the "Tang Die" is the most popular game for Jingpo young men and women during the Spring Festival. Usually, unmarried girls hang a cloth package high on a bamboo pole, and young men use guns to shoot at it. The "Tang Die" can contain all kinds of things: objects symbolizing auspiciousness and love, as well as things that poke fun at men; but most of them contain money, which is used to buy wine and treat everyone. Girls always hesitate for a long time when wrapping the "Tang Die": they are afraid that if they wrap too much money, others will hit it and take it away; if they wrap too little, and their sweetheart hits it, that would be embarrassing.

    During the Spring Festival, we made a special trip of a hundred li, rushing from Mangshi to the Xishan Cultural Station to see the "Tang Die" game.

    The young men heard that the "Tang Die" was hung by Shi Mujie, and they all came with their guns. Because Shi Mujie is the most beautiful girl in Xishan, and also the most capable female cadre in leading the masses to run the cooperative, who wouldn't want to get closer to her? Qi Gan's marksmanship is considered one of the best among the young men. He ran up and hit the target with just one shot. Without even bothering to pick up the "Tang Die," he grabbed Shi Mujie and demanded wine. Shi Mujie saw that it wasn't her sweetheart, so she played rogue and said, "The rules weren't set clearly. You stood too close. You have to hit it again to get wine." Qi Gan also felt that he was too rash and agreed to shoot again.

    Shi Mujie is no fool. This time she wrapped what she thought would be the most difficult things to hit in the "Tang Die": a piece of ploughshare iron, two necklace beads, and a nickel coin. She also laid a bamboo pole horizontally ten "pa" [note] away. Behind the bamboo pole stood fifty or sixty young men, concentrating twenty-eight bronze cannons and six or seven rifles. Perhaps they were nervous (the girls said the things inside the "Tang Die" had an effect). Ping, pang, ping, pang, after thirty or so shots, the "Tang Die" was still swaying in the wind on the bamboo pole. Old Man Pao Liang was so anxious that he was sweating profusely. He stared at the wine bottle in the girl's arms and drooled, yelling at the young men, "What kind of men are you? When I was young, I hit the target every time!" As he spoke, he tried to snatch someone else's gun to show off his skills. The young men knew he was bragging and didn't mind his words, and of course, they didn't lend him the gun. A kind-hearted old woman pleaded with Shi Mujie for the young men, saying, "Even though they didn't hit it, they put in a lot of effort. Let them drink some wine before they shoot again." The girls were having too much fun to consider personal feelings. So they kept shooting one shot after another, until the fifty-eighth shot, when it was finally hit by Yin Qieyong.

    At that moment, the young men were like a group of young bulls, rushing up to surround the girls and grab wine to drink. Old men and young children also squeezed in to join the fun. Those who got the wine nodded to Yin Qieyong repeatedly, "We're benefiting from you!" Yin Qieyong was so happy that he was shaking his head and didn't even bother to greet them, taking one sip after another.

    [Note] "Pa" is pronounced "pai." Extending both arms to the left and right is one "pa." The Jingpo people use "pa" as a unit to calculate distance.

    打唐碟
    王一　段月华
    唐碟是景颇话，就是靶。打唐碟是景颇族青年男女在春节中最喜爱的游戏。往往是未婚的姑娘把一个布包高挂在竹梢上，让小伙子们用枪打。唐碟内可以包着各式各样的东西：有象征吉祥、爱情的物件，也有取笑男人的东西；但多数包的是钱，用它拿去买酒请大家喝。姑娘们包唐碟时，总要犹豫半天：钱包得多了怕别人打中拿去，包得少了要是自己的爱人打着，那才难为情哩。
    春节，我们特意奔跑百十里，从芒市赶到西山文化站去参观打唐碟。
    小伙子们听说唐碟是石木介挂的，都背着枪赶来了。因为石木介是西山上最漂亮的姑娘，领导群众办社又是能力最强的女干部，谁不愿意多多接近她呢？奇干的枪法在小伙子中也算是数一数二的，他跑去只一枪就命中了，也顾不得拣唐碟，拉住石木介就要酒喝。石木介一看不是自己的心上人，耍赖皮说：“规矩没有讲好，站得太近了，再打中一枪才得喝酒。”奇干也觉得自己太冒失了，同意再打。
    石木介也不傻，这一次她在唐碟内包上她认为最难打的东西：一块犁头铁，两颗项珠，一枚镍币。又在十?〔注〕远的地方平摆一根竹子。竹子后面站着五十几个小伙子，集中了二十八枝铜炮枪和六、七枝步枪。也许是他们思想紧张吧（姑娘们说是唐碟内的东西起了作用），乒乓、乒乓，打了三十几响，唐碟依旧在竹梢上随风摆动。泡良用老汉在一旁急得满头大汗，瞅着姑娘怀里抱的酒瓶直淌口水，对着青年人乱嚷嚷：“你们算得上什么男子汉，我年轻的时候百发百中！”说着，就要夺别人的枪显显身手。小伙子们知道他是吹牛，听了毫不介意，当然也不把枪借给他。好心的老妈妈向石木介给小伙子讲情说：“虽说没有打中，可也费了不少力气，先请他们喝了酒再打吧。”姑娘们正在兴头上，哪里会看私人情面。就这样一枪一枪地打下去，直打到第五十八响，才被尹切勇打中了。
    这一下小伙子们真像一群小牯牛，冲上去围着姑娘们抢酒喝。老头子、小娃娃也挤上去凑热闹。喝到酒的人连连向尹切勇点头：“沾你的光！”直乐得尹切勇摇头晃脑，哪里还顾得打招呼，喝了一口又一口。
    〔注〕“?”读排，两臂向左右一伸就是一?。景颇族计算远近以?为单位。
