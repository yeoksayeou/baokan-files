Yellow winds swirl, obscuring the Yan City, it was here our friendship began.
Forty years ago, two young men, clapping hands and discussing essays with joy.
You studied philology with meticulous care, vermilion ink shining in tiny characters;
I loved literary embellishment and practiced ci poetry, ashamed of my insignificant skills.
East of Jingshan, schools stand in rows, we visited each other daily without rest.
Suddenly, you were struck with sorrow, closing your door, hiding your books, overwhelmed by worry.
So many injustices in the world, glaring at the sky, seeing only darkness!
Bloody winds and rain swept across China, the innocent people, why were they drained of their lifeblood!
Desiring to save the nation from decline, tears of passion were poured, hesitating without plan, forgetting food and sleep.
Suddenly hearing the truth of Marxism-Leninism,
You were delighted, throwing down your pen and rising up with determination.
One morning casting aside your old scholar's gown, pioneering the history of the labor movement.
Building a new China through hardships, experiencing all the difficulties of life and death.
Secret police intensely searching and arresting, sharing mornings and evenings in Lishi Hutong①.
Talking endlessly, wind and rain on the same bed, this feeling is still vivid today.
Anonymously seeking shelter, wandering the world②, breaking through the nets, spreading your wings.
Visiting me by the West Lake the following year③, in May, Jiangnan, the fallen flowers are beautiful.
Again, we parted like swallows flying in different directions, meeting again in Guangzhou④.
The sea water swirled in angry waves, raising the Hong Kong strike tide;
Washing away the filth, torrents surging, wind and thunder battling, dragons fleeing.
Old friend's affection long, days short, earnestly teaching me to abandon frivolous pursuits.
Waving goodbye in Guangzhou, this farewell became eternal!
Poisonous flames filled the sky, day turned to dusk, the orchids of the nine fields were all destroyed!
Taking righteousness, achieving benevolence, your ambition never wavered, a pure heart shining like the sun and moon.
Your blood was shed on Yuhuatai that year, today your great name is recorded in history.
I come to the platform and linger for a long time, the Yangtze River flows, the wind whispers;
Looking back over the past forty years, recalling past events without end!

① In 1921, I was living in my relatives' home in Lishi Hutong, Beijing. Zhongxia hid in my room, sharing the same bed.
② Zhongxia's original name was "Kang," courtesy name "Zhongxie," later changing to his current name. However, whether the name was changed at this time, I cannot clearly recall now.
③ In the summer of 1922, I was in Hangzhou, Zhongxia came to Hangzhou and stayed at a hotel by the lake.
④ In 1926, I went to Guangzhou, Zhongxia was in Guangzhou leading the Hong Kong workers' general strike.

    谒南京雨花台人民革命烈士墓，追怀邓中夏烈士
    许宝驹
    黄风漠漠翳燕市，此是与君结交始。
    四十年前两少年，抚掌论文各自喜。
    君治朴学实谨严，朱墨灿烂蝇头字；
    我爱文藻习词章，自愧雕虫小技耳。
    景山之东黉舍列，日日过从无休息。
    君忽枨触多悲辛，闭户掩卷忧横集。
    人间多少不平事，白眼看天天漆黑！
    腥风血雨遍神州，苍生何辜飞膏血！
    欲挽沉沦热泪倾，徬徨无计废寝食。
    忽闻马列主义之真理，
    君乃欢然投笔奋袂起。
    一朝抛却旧青衫，首创劳工运动史。
    艰难缔造新中国，历尽崎岖生死以。
    缇骑汹汹搜捕急，礼士胡同共晨夕①。
    风雨联床谈不足，此情而今犹历历。
    匿名投止走天涯②，冲碎罗网奋羽翼。
    隔年访我西湖滨③，五月江南正落英。
    又是东西各劳燕，与君再遇五羊城④。
    海水群飞卷怒涛，扬起香港罢工潮；
    荡涤浊垢洪流涌，风雷战斗蛟龙逃。
    故人情长日苦短，殷殷教我废甄陶。
    羊城挥手一为别，此别茫茫成永诀！
    毒焰漫天日昼昏，九畹兰蕙都摧折！
    取义成仁志不逾，一片精诚皎日月。
    当年血洒雨花台，今日大名垂竹帛。
    我来台上久徘徊，江水汤汤风飒飒；
    回首苍茫四十年，追怀往事无终极！
  ①1921年我在北京寄居礼士胡同亲戚家中，中夏避居我室内，共卧一榻。
  ②中夏原名“康”，字“仲澥”，后改今名　但是否确于此时改的名，现已记不甚清了。
  ③1922年夏间我在杭州，中夏来杭住湖滨旅馆。
  ④1926年我到广州，中夏正在广州领导香港工人总罢工的工作。
