Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 27th – Before the Spring Festival, the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce distributed the first batch of mutual aid funds. More than 770 private personnel from joint state-private enterprises with relatively difficult living conditions received more than 9,600 yuan in mutual aid funds. This mutual aid fund was raised by private personnel from various joint state-private factories and shops donating a portion of their dividends.

Many industrialists and businessmen who received the mutual aid funds were very moved. They said that only in the new society can the industrial and commercial sectors achieve unity and mutual assistance. Liu Hong'an, a private person from the joint state-private Yuanda Cloth Factory, and Yang Shisheng, a private person from the joint state-private Clock and Watch Store, received mutual aid funds because they were recuperating at home due to illness, had less dividend income, and had heavier family burdens. Yang Shisheng said that in the old society, the industrial and commercial sectors were all fighting each other, but in the new society, they have become as close as family.

    旧社会互相倾轧  新社会亲如家人
    新华社重庆27日电　春节前，重庆市工商业联合会发放了第一批互助金，七百七十多户生活困难较多的公私合营企业的私方人员得到了九千六百多元互助金。这笔互助金是由各公私合营厂、店私方人员捐献一部分股息而筹集起来的。
    许多得到互助金的工商业者都很感动。他们说，只有在新社会工商界才能做到团结互助。公私合营远大布厂私方人员刘鸿安和公私合营钟表商店私方人员杨时升因病在家休养，股息收入少，家庭负担较重，他们都得到了互助金。杨时升说，在旧社会工商界都是互相倾轧，到新社会变成了亲如家人。
