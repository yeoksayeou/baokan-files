    Dry Land Turns into Paddy Field, Disaster Turns into Bumper Harvest
                  Hui Mingshen
    Last December, I visited the Yuetan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanshi County, Henan Province. Here, I saw the cooperative members who had overcome disasters and achieved a bumper harvest working vigorously and intensely to strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year.
    This area had been experiencing continuous drought for three or four months, but the wheat seedlings were growing vigorously. Over 1,730 mu of the cooperative's 2,224 mu of wheat had been watered with "sealing root water," and seedlings were being transplanted and replanted in areas with missing seedlings. Looking at the tender green and fertile wheat seedlings, who could imagine that this place was in the midst of a drought?
    In the autumn of 1956, the Yuetan Agricultural Production Cooperative suffered a severe flood. Over 1,500 mu of the 2,270 mu of autumn crops were flooded, of which 470 mu collapsed into the Luo River, washing away months of hard work. But the cooperative members did not lose heart. They actively carried out drainage and disaster resistance, so that the autumn crops still yielded more than 320,000 jin. Coupled with the unprecedented bumper harvest of more than 2,400 mu of summer wheat, the average yield per mu was 375 jin, excluding losses due to rain and mildew. Despite the disaster, the total annual output last year increased by more than 130,000 jin compared to the bumper year of 1955. There are many reasons for the bumper harvest. For example, converting dry land into paddy fields, adopting improved varieties, reasonable close planting, overcoming wheat midges and wind and sand, and applying fertilizer reasonably in stages. Among them, the decisive factor was the conversion of dry land into paddy fields. But without agricultural collectivization, it would have been very difficult to convert dry land into paddy fields in Yuetan.
    Converting dry land into paddy fields has been the ideal of the people of Yuetan for many years. After agricultural collectivization, it was realized in one winter.
    Before the winter of 1955, despite years of effort, the farmers of Yuetan had only developed 561 mu of well-irrigated land. Watered land was very precious here. Cooperative Director Liu Yingxiang said humorously: "In the past, when girls from other villages 'proposed marriage' to Yuetan, as long as the man had five mu of watered land, the marriage was 80% certain." Digging a well was very difficult. The soil layer here is thin, and underneath is sandy soil, so the well shaft must be completely lined with bricks; plus a waterwheel, it cost no less than 300 yuan to dig a well. Therefore, in the past, very few households dug wells.
    Speaking of water, the people of Yuetan always had a feeling of both envy and fear. Envy of well water, fear of river water. The villages located between the Yi and Luo rivers, tributaries of the Yellow River, are collectively called "Jihe Tan" (Sandwiched River Beach). Yuetan is located close to the confluence of the Yi and Luo rivers, surrounded by water on three sides. The Yi and Luo rivers have brought "two disasters in three years" to the people of Yuetan, and no one dared to expect to benefit from the Yi and Luo rivers.
    In 1952, Liu Yingxiang organized the first mutual aid group. He boldly thought of using the water of the Yi and Luo rivers to irrigate the fields. He saw someone using a "lever" to lift water from the canal to irrigate the land, and he wondered: Could the water of the Yi and Luo rivers be lifted with a "lever"? This idea was quickly rejected: large-scale irrigation with a "lever" would be of no avail.
    In the same year, news of the making of hand-cranked waterwheels was reported in the newspapers. Liu Yingxiang was extremely excited. From then on, he studied waterwheels. In 1953, he found a discarded wheel from a Liberation-style waterwheel in the county construction department. He explained his plan to the comrades in the construction department and asked for the wheel. Just as he was energetically experimenting, a merciless flood destroyed the crops. They put all their efforts into production and disaster relief. In the spring of 1954, they overcame the disaster, and the first elementary cooperative in Yuetan Village was established. Liu Yingxiang was elected as the director, and the autumn crops grew exceptionally well; however, they suffered an even greater flood than in 1953.
    In those two years, they overcame the disasters by organizing themselves, and they could not take care of the agricultural infrastructure construction to transform nature.
    In the summer of 1955, the agricultural cooperative had an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest, with an average of 341 jin per mu (before this, a yield of 200 jin per mu was considered a great harvest). This inspiring initiative attracted many farmers to the cooperative. In the autumn, this village of 352 households established six elementary agricultural cooperatives. At this time, turning dry land into paddy fields became the urgent demand of the Yuetan farmers after collectivization.
    Liu Yingxiang picked up the hand-cranked waterwheel that had been put aside for two years and studied it again. With the help of the Huaimiao Iron Industry Production Cooperative, the first hand-cranked waterwheel was made; then the problem of mud and sand in the water was solved, and lifting river water with a hand-cranked waterwheel was successful. A hand-cranked waterwheel could irrigate five or six mu of land a day, twice as fast as a Liberation-style waterwheel. Thus, a mass and magnificent water conservancy construction movement was formed. The cooperative members, according to the surveyed terrain and riverbank conditions, dug diversion canals where appropriate, and dug river-penetrating wells where canals could not be dug. In three months, they opened 13 diversion canals, dug 10 river-penetrating wells, installed 30 hand-cranked waterwheels, and erected a spider web-like network of irrigation channels in the fields, expanding the irrigated area by 1,750 mu, bringing the total watered area of the cooperative to more than 2,310 mu, accounting for 88.5% of the total cultivated land area. It only cost 1,800 yuan to do so much work. In 1956, about 90% of the wheat was watered with warming water, greening water, jointing water, booting water, and filling water, creating a large-scale bumper harvest.
    Autumn crops were planted according to the land conditions, "White Horse Tooth" corn was planted, millet was planted on slightly higher ground, and sorghum was planted on lower ground. In the autumn, when the flood occurred, the cooperative organized members to drain water and resist the disaster in a timely manner. After fighting the water for two days, they dug trenches, allowing the water in the low-lying areas to flow into the river along the trenches, ensuring a better harvest for 1,500 mu of crops. At the same time, the cooperative immediately organized sideline production and prepared for wheat planting.
    I couldn't see any sign that they had suffered a severe flood in the autumn here. New houses were being built one after another. The collectively managed timber and bamboo industries were producing and selling at the same time. The cooperative's agriculture and sideline occupations, collective management and individual management in sideline occupations, have reasonable division of labor. The whole cooperative wants to earn more than 30,000 yuan in winter sideline production, which can compensate for the losses caused by the disaster.
    Cooperative Director Liu Yingxiang told me: "In the past, when we saw the river rising, we would plan to go out. After the water receded, no one cared if the crops in the fields were soaked in the water. After being exposed to the sun, the crops would be 'cooked' to death. In 1956, we actively drained water and saved crops that could not have survived in previous years, reducing the disaster. In those years after the floods, the government provided relief and unified sales. In 1956, after suffering the disaster, our cooperative did not ask for government relief, nor did we ask the state to sell a single grain of grain. 1954 was a disaster year, and the state supplied a net of 190,000 jin of grain after offsetting purchases and sales; in 1955, there was no disaster, and only more than 40,000 jin of surplus grain were sold after offsetting purchases and sales; 1956 was also a disaster year, and our cooperative sold more than 150,000 jin of surplus grain, and not a single jin needed to be supplied by the state. The cooperative has the strength to increase production, and also has the strength to resist disasters."

    旱田变水田，灾荒变丰收
                  惠明深
    去年12月间，我访问了河南偃师县的岳滩农业生产合作社。在这里，我看到战胜灾害获得了丰收的社员们正在精神奕奕地为了争取今年的小麦丰收而紧张地劳动。
    这一带连续三、四个月都是干旱天气，但是麦苗却生长得很旺盛。全社二千二百二十四亩小麦有一千七百三十多亩浇过了“封根水”，缺苗的地方正在移苗补栽，看到叶儿嫩绿而肥实的麦苗，人们哪能想到这里正在干旱之中呢？
    1956年的秋季，岳滩农业生产合作社曾遭受了严重的水灾，二千二百七十余亩秋庄稼被水淹了一千五百亩，其中四百七十亩塌到洛河里去，几个月的勤劳付之东流了。但是社员们没有泄气。他们积极地进行了排水抗灾，使秋季作物仍有三十二万多斤的收成。加上夏季的二千四百多亩小麦空前丰收，除因雨霉烂的损失外，每亩平均实收三百七十五斤。在受灾的情况下，去年全年比丰收的1955年还增产十三万多斤。丰收的原因很多。如旱田改水田，采用优良品种，合理密植，战胜吸浆虫和风沙，分期合理施肥，等等，都是。其中决定性的因素是旱田改水田。可是如果没有农业合作化，在岳滩要把旱田改成水田是很不容易办到的。
    旱田改水田是岳滩人多少年来的理想。农业合作化后，一个冬天就实现了。
    1955年冬季以前，岳滩的农民不知经过多少年的努力，井浇地只发展到五百六十一亩。水地在这里是很珍贵的。社长刘应祥诙谐的说：“从前外村的姑娘‘提媒’到岳滩，只要男方有五亩水地，这门亲事就八成中啦。”打一眼井是很不容易的。这里土层薄，底下是沙土，井筒必须全部用砖圈起来；再加上一部水车，打成一眼井不下三百元。因此过去打井的户寥寥无几。
    提起水，岳滩的人们总是怀着一种既羡慕又畏惧的心情。羡慕的是井水，害怕的是河水。座落在黄河支流伊河、洛河之间的村庄，人们统称它“夹河滩”。岳滩紧临伊河、洛河汇流处，三面环水。伊河、洛河给岳滩人民带来的是“三年两灾”，谁也没敢指望过从伊河、洛河里得益。
    1952年刘应祥组织了第一个互助组。他曾大胆地想到利用伊河、洛河的水灌溉田地。他看见有人在水渠上用“秤杆”提水浇过地，他就琢磨：伊河、洛河的水能不能用“秤杆”提呢？这个打算很快被自己否定了：大面积的灌溉用“秤杆”是无济于事的。
    就在这一年，报纸上介绍了做成手摇水车的消息。刘应祥兴奋极了。从此，他就研究水车。1953年在县建设科发现了一个解放式水车的废旧轮子，他向建设科里同志说明了他的打算，要了轮子来。正当他满劲试验的时候，无情的水灾淹坏了庄稼。他们全力投到生产救灾上去了。1954年春天度过了灾荒，岳滩村的第一个初级社建成了，刘应祥当选为社长，秋季的庄稼长的格外好；可是，又遭受了比1953年更大的水灾。
    那两年，他们是在组织起来战胜灾荒的情况下度过的，改造自然的农业基本建设还顾不到。
    1955年的夏季，农业社的小麦空前丰收，每亩平均三百四十一斤（在这以前，每亩地能收到二百斤小麦，就是大好的收成）。这个振奋人心的创举把许多农民吸引到社里来了。秋天，这个三百五十二户的村建成了六个初级农业社。这时候，变旱田为水田成了合作化后的岳滩农民迫切的要求。
    刘应祥重新拿起了放了两年的手摇水车来研究。在槐庙铁业生产合作社的帮助下，第一部手摇水车做成了；接着又解决了水里带泥沙的问题，用手摇水车提河水成功了。一部手摇水车一天可浇地五、六亩，比解放式水车快两倍。于是，一个群众性的规模壮阔的水利建设运动形成了。社员们根据勘查好的地形、河岸情况，宜挖引水渠的挖引水渠，不能挖渠的打透河井。三个月的时间，就开成了十三条引水渠，打成十眼透河井，安上了三十部手摇水车，地里垅起了蛛网般的流水道，扩大了水浇地一千七百五十亩，使全社水田扩大到二千三百一十余亩，占总耕地面积的88.5％。办这么多事，只花了一千八百元。1956年，90％左右的小麦浇了地温水、返青水、拔节水、孕穗水、灌浆水，创造了大面积的丰收。
    秋季作物因地种植，玉米种的“白马牙”，稍高的地种谷子，低地种高粱。秋天遭受了水灾，社里及时组织社员排水抗灾。和水斗争了两天，挑成壕沟，使低下地里的水顺沟流到河里去，保证了一千五百亩庄稼的较好的收成。同时，社里立即组织了副业生产，并做好了种麦工作。
    我在这里看不出秋季遭受了严重水灾的样子。一间一间的新房子盖起来了。集体经营的木业、竹业，一面生产，一面推销。社里的农业和副业，副业中的集体经营和个人经营，都有合理的分工，全社要在冬季副业生产中收入三万多元，可以弥补受灾的损失。
    社长刘应祥告诉我：“过去一见河涨水，就打下外出的谱，水落了，任凭下地的庄稼浸到水里也没人管，经太阳一晒，庄稼就被‘煮’死了。1956年我们积极排水，救活了在往常年不能活的庄稼，减轻了灾害。那几年水灾后，政府又救济，又统销。1956年受了灾，我们社没要政府救济，也没要国家统销一斤粮食。1954年是受灾年，购销相抵国家净供应了十九万斤粮食；1955年没受灾，购销相抵，只卖余粮四万多斤；1956年也是受灾年，我们社卖余粮十五多万斤，一斤也不用国家供应。合作社有力量增产，也有力量抗灾。”
