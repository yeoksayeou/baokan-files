    Letter of Correction
    In my article "We Are Not Powerless Before Nature," published on the third page of the December 14th issue last year, there are serious inaccuracies. The actual increase in grain production in Gansu Province last year was 3.02 billion jin, cotton production increased by nearly 100,000 dan, and the irrigated area was expanded by 4.34 million mu. However, in my article, I wrote that grain production increased by 3.33 billion jin, cotton production increased by 240,000 dan, and the irrigated area was expanded by 5.3 million mu.
    The figures I cited when writing this article were preliminary estimates from a unit in Gansu Province in September. By the time I wrote the article, the actual increase figures had already been calculated, but I failed to verify them. This shows that I lacked the necessary sense of responsibility in my work. I am very grateful for and fully accept the opinions and criticisms of the responsible comrades of the Rural Work Department of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding this article, and I am determined to prevent similar errors from occurring in future work.　Kang Weizhong

    来函更正
    去年12月14日第三版发表的我所写的“我们在大自然面前不是无能为力的”一稿，有严重失实的地方。去年甘肃全省粮食实际增产三十亿二千万斤，棉花增产近十万担，扩大灌溉面积四百三十四万亩；而我在稿中写的是粮食增产三十三亿三千万斤，棉花增产二十四万担，扩大灌溉面积五百三十万亩。
    我写这篇稿件的时候引述的数字是9月份甘肃省的一个单位初步估计出来的。在我写稿的时候，实际增产的数目字已经计算出来了，我却没有加以核对。这说明了我在工作上缺乏应有的责任心。我十分感激并完全接受中共甘肃省委农村工作部负责同志对这篇稿件提出的意见和批评，并决心在今后工作中防止类似错误的发生。　  康伟中
