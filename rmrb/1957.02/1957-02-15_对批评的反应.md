Responses to Criticism

    Hebei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office writes: The letters from Comrades Jiang Zhensheng and Lin Xiao published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 7, 1957, and December 20, 1956, respectively, which criticized the large price difference between purchasing and selling sheepskin in Hebei Province, the numerous operating links, high costs, and high prices of leather clothing, are basically correct.

    In order to solve this problem, we have organized an investigation and research group to conduct in-depth investigations at the grassroots level and have determined to spend two months identifying the operational links that should be reduced and lower costs in order to narrow the purchase and sale price difference. This issue involves many departments, and we will report to the Provincial People's Committee for resolution after clarifying the situation.

    Jiangxi Province, Fenyi County Agricultural Products Purchasing Bureau writes: The situation described in the article "The Ramie Market in Fenyi is Too Chaotic" published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 17 is factual. We have conducted an inspection and requested relevant leading departments to help resolve this issue.

    对批评的反应
    河北省供销合作总社来信：人民日报1957年1月7日和1956年12月20日读者来信栏中分别登载的姜振声、林虓两同志的信，批评河北省羊皮购销差价大，经营环节多，费用大，皮衣价格高等问题，基本上是正确的。
    为了解决这个问题，我们已经组织了调查研究组，深入基层进行调查，确定用两个月的时间，找出应该减少的经营环节，降低费用，以缩小购销差价。这个问题涉及很多部门，我们将情况弄清后将报请省人民委员会解决。
    江西省分宜县农产品采购局来信：1月17日人民日报读者来信栏所登载的分宜苎麻市场太混乱一稿所说的情况是事实，我们已进行检查，并请有关领导部门帮助解决这个问题。
