    阿尔巴尼亚去年国家计划超额完成
    新华社地拉那4日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国家计划委员会中央统计局3日公布了1956年国家计划执行结果的公报。
    公报说，1956年工业总产量计划完成了101.7％，比1955年总产量提高了8.2％；农业部门完成了原计划的100.2％；商业部门完成了102.2％；文化教育部门完成了106.1％。
    在去年一年中，国家共完成了二百七十一项新建工程。
    各工业部门完成计划的百分比如下：
    石油工业103.5％；沥青工业102.3％；煤矿工业102.1％；铬工业101.6％；电力工业108.2％；机器制造业108.5％；建筑材料工业100.6％；木材工业97.1％；轻工业95.1％；食品工业110.7％。这一年生产的工业和生活用品的品种增加了，劳动生产率也大大提高了。
    农业方面，与上个农业年度相比较，耕地面积扩大了3.1％，其中种植面包谷物的面积扩大了7.6％，耕种荒地的计划完成了100.4％，耕种荒地的面积比整个第一个五年计划多一倍。
    1956年标志着转向农业合作化方向的转折点。到1956年年底，农业合作社的数目由1955年底的三百十八个增加到了八百八十一个。就是说，目前农业合作社总数中63.9％是在去年建立的。参加合作社的农户已经占全国农户总数的58.8％。
    由于劳动生产率的提高和生产成本的降低，1956年曾两次降低物价，并且在1956年1月开始取消了工业品的配给制度。在过去的一年中，国家为劳动人民建造了六万五千多平方公尺的住宅，新设了不少学校，增设了夜大学和函授学校等。在这一年，政府还增加了优抚金和提高了低薪人员的工资。
    （编者注）1956年是阿尔巴尼亚第二个五年计划的第一年。根据计划规定，到1960年，工业总产值将增加91％，轻工业产值将增加一倍，食品工业将增加94％。农产品和畜产品的产量也将大大扩大。1960年的谷物收获量应比1955年增加46％，棉花87％。合作社的播种面积到1960年将占全国播种面积的70％。国民收入将提高53％，工人和职员的实际工资将提高23％。
