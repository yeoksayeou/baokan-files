The “Omnipotent Factory” at the Head of the Yangtze River Bridge
				By our correspondent Cao Baoming

    One afternoon, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau installed the first vibration pile driver they manufactured on Pier No. 1 for a test run.

    The workers from the Mechanical Repair and Leasing Station who personally manufactured this machine came, and the Soviet expert team leader, Sirin, and mechanical expert Prokhorov also came. Everyone quietly watched the machine. The worker in charge of the electricity pushed the switch, and the large gears inside the vibration pile driver rotated rapidly, emitting a huge roar. The large pipe column with a diameter of 1.55 meters, which had been difficult to drive in using many previous methods, then penetrated the very resistant overburden and gradually sank towards the bedrock at the bottom of the river. It sank 8.4 cun in three and a half minutes. The quiet crowd gathered around immediately stirred. Expert Prokhorov also turned around and shook hands with each of the workers who manufactured the machine. He also said to Zhou Mingqi, the deputy director of the machine and fitter workshop in this station, "Thank you and the workers for making such a good machine!" Zhou Mingqi wanted to say at the time: "How could we have manufactured such a machine without your help? We should be thanking you!" But before he could say it, comrades from the newspaper office came to take pictures. Prokhorov then fetched a stool and asked the workers to sit down, while he and Sirin stood beside them, and they took a picture together.

    Prokhorov was so excited because many of the large pipe columns of Pier No. 1 had already sunk to the bedrock at the bottom of the river, and only these few pipe columns remained. Because the overburden at the bottom of the river was very solid, they could not sink to the bedrock no matter what they did. They had tried using a vibration pile driver manufactured by the Shenyang Bridge Factory, but it could not drive the columns in. They also hoisted a 21-ton cement hammer to drive them in, but it only sank 2 centimeters in eight hours. Now, the machine they manufactured themselves sunk the pipe column so much in three and a half minutes, how could he not be excited?

    Although the vibration pile driver manufactured by the Shenyang Bridge Factory only had 17 tons of vibratory force, it was still the most advanced pile driver in our country. Before this, our country did not even have a copy of such a blueprint. Because the Yangtze River Bridge project needed it, the Soviet Exhibition Hall specially disassembled their exhibit and allowed people from the Yangtze River Bridge to trace the drawings and hand them over to the Shenyang Bridge Factory for manufacturing. However, even such an advanced machine could not meet the requirements of the Yangtze River Bridge project. At this time, Soviet experts produced a design drawing they had brought from Moscow for a vibration pile driver with 44 tons of vibratory force. Under the direct guidance of expert Prokhorov, the employees of the Mechanical Repair and Leasing Station of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau manufactured this powerful vibration pile driver. Then, with Prokhorov's help, they designed and manufactured a second and a third vibration pile driver, each more powerful than the last. This solved the problem of the pipe columns sinking for the Yangtze River Bridge. A few days ago, a vibration pile driver with 140 tons of vibratory force that they manufactured sank a large pipe column with a diameter of five meters, the same size as a bridge pier, by four meters and four centimeters in one minute and twenty-six seconds.

    The Mechanical Repair and Leasing Station of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau played a significant role in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge. Large crane ships were needed to lift and transport large objects on the river. Out of the five in the entire country, three were sent, but they were still not enough. The employees of this station then manufactured a large crane ship with a lifting capacity of 35 tons themselves. Many drilling machines and drill bits were needed for drilling holes. These drilling machines and drill bits had to be tested and the designs modified on the river, making it difficult to order them from abroad. The employees of this station then manufactured eight large drilling machines one after another, including impact drills, pneumatic drills, and rotary drills; they also manufactured twenty-one large drill bits. This met the needs of the drilling construction. To erect the bridge, steel beams needed to be lifted and transported at high altitude, so they manufactured a crawler crane with a lifting capacity of 35 tons and a double-boom crane with a lifting capacity of 40 tons. They also assembled floating power plants, floating concrete mixing plants, and floating repair plants specially suitable for bridge construction, as well as a combined work boat with various equipment for power generation, lifting, pile extraction, and concrete mixing. At the same time, they manufactured a wide variety of tools for bridge construction. These many lifting equipment they manufactured were also automatically controlled by electricity. Therefore, the workers of the Yangtze River Bridge call the Mechanical Repair and Leasing Station the "Omnipotent Factory at the Head of the Yangtze River Bridge."

    In my imagination, this mechanical station must be a factory with complete equipment and excellent technology. However, the person in charge of this station told me: There were originally only two or three old machines and fifty or so people here. It took four months to repair a welding machine. After expert Prokhorov arrived, he believed that this station should serve the bridge construction and serve it well, so more people were added and equipment was increased. Even after this expansion, they still did not have equipment such as boring machines, rolling mills, and gantry planers. Before the first quarter of last year, the chief engineer of their station was still the lowest-ranking fourth-grade, third-level engineer. In the technical office responsible for design and drafting, in addition to two engineers, all were interns just out of school, and the vast majority were graduates of secondary technical schools. The workers who manufactured the vibration pile driver were at most fifth-grade workers, and most were below fourth grade. However, with the help of experts such as Prokhorov, they manufactured many machines that our country had never manufactured before!

    When they first accepted the task of manufacturing the first vibration pile driver, Prokhorov asked Zhou Mingqi: "Do you think you can do it or not?"

    Zhou Mingqi had heard before that even the Soviet Union had not yet officially produced such a machine, so he hesitated and replied: "This, this, I'm afraid we can't do it."

    "Have you done it before?"

    "Of course, I haven't done it."

    "If you haven't even done it, how can you say you can't do it?" Prokhorov said with a smile, and gave him a lot of encouragement.

    At that time, the young people in the technical office sometimes made mistakes when tracing drawings, so Prokhorov taught them what drawings to draw and how to draw them. After they finished drawing, he personally proofread and revised them. During manufacturing, he always went back and forth in the workshop to check specifically, and immediately told the workers to correct any mistakes he found.

    At this time, everyone's work enthusiasm was very high. The bearing holes for manufacturing the pile driver shell needed to be bored with a boring machine, but they did not have a boring machine, so they tried to modify a lathe to replace the boring machine; before boring the holes, they needed a flat plate marking device, but they did not have one, so they tried to find other things to replace it…

    Precisely because Comrade Prokhorov provided conscientious and specific assistance, and the employees actively studied technology and tried to overcome difficulties, this mechanical station manufactured many machines and tools. Now, they are preparing to further improve their technology in order to better serve the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge.

    长江桥头的“万能工厂”
                本报记者　曹葆铭
    一天下午，武汉长江大桥工程局把他们制造的第一台震动打桩机安在一号桥墩上试车。
    亲手制造这台机器的机械修配经租站的工人们来了，苏联专家组长西林和机械专家普罗赫罗夫也来了。大家都肃静地望着这台机器。管电门的工人将开关一推，震动打桩机里的大齿轮便飞速地旋转起来，发出了巨大的轰鸣声。过去想了很多办法都没有打下去的直径一点五五公尺的大型管柱，这时穿过阻力很大的复盖层，逐渐向江底岩盘下沉。三分半钟下沉了八公寸四。聚集在周围的静悄悄的人群立即骚动起来了。普罗赫罗夫专家也转过身来，跟制造这台机器的工人一一握手。他还向这个站的机钳车间副主任周鸣岐说：“感谢你和工人们做出了这样好的机器！”周鸣岐当时想说：“要没有你的帮助，我们怎么能制造出这样的机器来呢？应该是我们感谢你才对！”但他还没有说出口，报社的同志便来照像了。普罗赫罗夫又去端了条板凳来，要工人们坐着，他和西林站着，一起拍照。
    普罗赫罗夫这样兴奋，是因为一号墩的许多大型管柱都下沉到江底岩盘了，就剩下这几根管柱，因为江底的复盖层很结实，怎么也下不到岩盘上去。他们曾经用沈阳桥梁厂制造的震动打桩机来打，打不动。他们又吊起二十一吨重的水泥锤来打，八小时才打下了二公分。现在，他们自己制造的这台机器三分半钟就将管柱打下去了这么多，怎能叫他不兴奋呢？
    沈阳桥梁厂制造的震动打桩机，虽然只有十七吨的震动力，但它还是我国最新式的打桩机呢。在这以前，我国连一份这样的图纸也没有。因为长江大桥工程需要，苏联展览馆特地将他们的展品拆开，让长江大桥的人去描出图来，交给沈阳桥梁厂制造。但是，就是这样的新式机器，也不能满足长江大桥工程的要求。这时，苏联专家们拿出了他们从莫斯科带来的一份具有四十四吨震动力的震动打桩机的设计图。武汉长江大桥工程局机械修配经租站的职工们，在普罗赫罗夫专家直接指导下，把这台威力强大的震动打桩机制造了出来。接着，他们又在普罗赫罗夫帮助下，设计和制造了第二台、第三台震动打桩机，而且一台比一台的威力强大。这样就解决了长江大桥的管柱下沉问题。他们前些日子制造出的一台具有一百四十吨震动力的震动打桩机，在十分二十六秒钟内，就把跟一座桥墩一样大小的五公尺直径的大管柱下沉了四公尺四。
    武汉长江大桥工程局的机械修配经租站，在长江大桥施工中起了很大的作用。在江上吊运大型物件需要大吊船，全国只有五艘就派来了三艘，但是还不够用。这个站的职工们就自己制造了一艘吊重三十五吨的大吊船。钻孔需要许多钻机、钻头，这些钻机、钻头要在江上边试验边修改设计，很难向国外订货。这个站的职工们便先后制造了八台大型钻机，有冲击式的，有汽动式的，有旋钻式的；他们还制造了二十一个大型钻头。这就满足了钻孔施工的需要。架桥需要在高空吊运钢梁，他们就制造了一台吊重三十五吨的爬行吊机和一台吊重四十吨的双动臂吊机。他们还装配了专门适用于桥梁施工的水上发电厂、水上混凝土搅拌厂、水上修配厂，以及一艘具有发电、吊重、拔桩和混凝土搅拌等各种设备的联合工作船。他们同时制造了大桥施工用的多种多样的工具。他们制造的这许多吊重设备，还都是电力自动控制的。所以，长江大桥的工人们都把机械修配经租站叫做“长江桥头的万能工厂”。
    在我的想像中，这个机械站一定是座设备齐全、技术优良的工厂。但是，这个站的负责人却向我说：这里原来只有两三台旧机器，五十来个人，修理一部电焊机花了四个月时间。普罗赫罗夫专家来了以后，认为这个站应该为大桥施工服务，而且要服务得很好，才添了人，增加了设备。这样扩充以后，他们也还没有搪床、滚床和龙门刨床等设备。在去年第一季度以前，他们站里的总工程师，也还是级别最低的四等三级工程师。负责设计绘图的技术室里，除了两个工程师外，都是刚出学校的实习生，而且绝大多数是中等技术学校毕业的。制造震动打桩机的工人，技术最高的也只是五级工，一般都在四级以下。但是，他们就在普罗赫罗夫等专家的帮助下，制造了许多我国从来没有制造过的机器！
    当他们刚接受制造第一台震动打桩机的任务的时候，普罗赫罗夫问周鸣岐：“你说能做不能做？”
    周鸣岐事前听说过苏联都还没有正式生产这样的机器，便迟疑不决地回答道：“这，这，恐怕不能做。”
    “你从前做过吗？”
    “当然没有做过。”
    “你做都没有做过，怎么能说不能做呢？”普罗赫罗夫笑了笑说，并且给了他许多鼓励。
    当时，技术室的青年们有时候描图都会描错，普罗赫罗夫便教给他们画什么图，怎么画，等他们画好以后，又亲自校订和修改。在制造的时候，他总是来来回回地在车间里具体检查，一发现有做得不对的地方，就马上告诉工人改正。
    这时候，大家的工作热情很高。制造打桩机外壳的轴承孔需要用搪床搪眼，他们没有搪床，就想法改装车床，用车床代替搪床；在搪眼以前需要用平板画线的设备，他们没有，就想办法用别的东西代替……。
    正因为普罗赫罗夫同志认真、具体地进行帮助，职工们积极钻研技术，设法克服困难，这个机械站才制造出了许多机具。现在，他们准备进一步提高技术，以便更好地为长江大桥施工服务。
