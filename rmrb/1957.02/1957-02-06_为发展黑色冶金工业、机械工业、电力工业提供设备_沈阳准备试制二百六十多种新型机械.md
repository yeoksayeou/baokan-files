Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 5th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Dianxue reporting): Workers from fifteen machinery and electrical factories in Shenyang will trial-produce more than 260 types of new heavy, precision, and specialized machine equipment this year to equip important industrial sectors such as the ferrous metallurgical industry, mechanical industry, and power industry. Currently, the first domestically produced 2,500-ton hydraulic press has begun manufacturing at Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant; a 40,500 kVA transformer will be shipped from Shenyang Transformer Plant to its designated user in early April; and five new products already designed by Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant began material preparation in February. Some new products are under intense design.

This year's trial production includes 77 types of heavy machinery equipment such as crushing, washing, ore dressing, metallurgy, steel rolling, and steel forging equipment. The heavy-duty plate feeder independently designed by Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant can send 180 cubic meters of iron ore per hour into the crusher. The jaw crusher trial-produced by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant can crush one cubic meter of iron ore into 0.2 cubic meter fragments. The 2,500-ton forging hydraulic press trial-produced by this factory weighs more than 500 tons and can generate 2,500 tons of pressure, processing 45-ton heavy forgings. It can be used to forge turbine blades for turbine engines, large rolling rolls for rolling mills, and forging dies for forging hammers. The 40,500 kVA transformer currently being assembled at Shenyang Transformer Plant is as tall as a two-story building and occupies an area of 44.8 square meters. Now, this factory is preparing to manufacture a giant 60,000 kVA transformer.

Three machine tool factories will trial-produce 14 types of specialized, automated or semi-automated, and precision machine tools this year. A lathe trial-produced by Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant will be specifically used to process machine tool lead screws. The lead screws processed by this machine tool will have an error of only one or two wires. The four-axis automatic lathe trial-produced by Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant only requires workers to feed the material to the lathe on time, and the remaining work will be done by the lathe itself.

Shenyang Water Pump Factory will trial-produce boiler feed water pumps, condensate pumps for conveying steam condensate, and large circulating water pumps with a diameter of 0.8 meters this year. Shenyang Cable Factory will trial-produce cables and wires used in ships, automobiles, tractors, and oil drilling rigs this year. The 35,000 kVA oil-immersed paper-insulated cable trial-produced by this factory this year can be buried underground or laid on the seabed to transmit high-voltage current. A pneumatic wrench tool trial-produced by Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory can be used to tighten screws on bridges or various machines instead of by hand.

Many of the new products trial-produced by Shenyang's machinery and electrical factories this year are independently designed based on foreign advanced technological achievements and according to China's specific conditions. Two-thirds of the new products at Shenyang Water Pump Factory are independently designed. Among the seven types of mining washing and ore dressing equipment trial-produced by Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant, five are independently designed. The blooming mill independently designed by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant consists of 35 sets of machines, is 140 meters long, and weighs more than 2,000 tons. From feeding to rolling out steel billets, the entire process is operated by this machine itself. This is the first complete set of blooming mill designed and manufactured independently in China.

    为发展黑色冶金工业、机械工业、电力工业提供设备
    沈阳准备试制二百六十多种新型机械
    新华社沈阳5日电　新华社记者王殿学报道：沈阳十五家机械和电机工厂的职工，今年将试制两百六十多种重型、精密、专用的新型机器设备，以装备黑色冶金工业、机械工业、电力工业等重要工业部门。目前，国产第一台两千五百吨水压机，已经在沈阳重型机器厂开始制造；四万零五百千伏安变压器，在4月初就要从沈阳变压器厂运给定户；沈阳矿山机器厂已经设计好的五种新产品从2月份开始投料制造。有的新产品正在紧张设计中。
    今年试制的这些新产品里，破碎、洗选、冶金、轧钢、锻钢等重型机器设备就有七十七种。沈阳矿山机器厂自行设计的重型板式给矿机，每小时可以把一百八十立方公尺铁矿石送进破碎机里去。沈阳重型机器厂试制的颚式破碎机，可以把一立方公尺的铁矿石碾成零点二立方公尺的碎块。这个厂试制的两千五百吨锻造水压机，重五百多吨，能产生出两千五百吨压力，加工四十五吨重锻件，可以用来锻造透平机的汽轮叶、轧钢机上的大轧辊、锻钢汽锤上用的锻件模。沈阳变压器厂正在装配的四万零五百千伏安变压器，有两层楼那么高，占地面积四十四点八平方公尺。现在这个厂又准备制造六万千伏安的巨型变压器。
    三家机床厂今年将试制十四种专用、自动化或半自动化和精密的机床。沈阳第一机床厂试制的一种车床，将专门用来加工机床的丝杠。用这种机床加工好的丝杠，误差只有一道到两道。沈阳第三机床厂试制的四轴自动化车床，只要工人按时把料递给车床，剩下的工作就都由这种车床自己来干。
    沈阳水泵厂今年要试制锅炉给水泵、输送蒸汽凝结成水的凝结水泵、口径零点八公尺的大循环水泵等。沈阳电缆厂今年要试制用在船舶、汽车、拖拉机、石油钻探机上的电缆和电线。这个工厂今年试制的三万五千千伏安油浸纸绝缘电缆，可以埋在地下或铺设在水底来输送高压电流。沈阳风动工具厂试制的一种风扳手工具，可以用来代替双手紧桥梁或各种机器上的螺丝。
    今年沈阳机械、电机工厂试制的很多新产品，是运用外国先进的技术成就，根据我国的具体情况独立设计出来的。沈阳水泵厂有三分之二的新产品是独立设计的。沈阳矿山机器厂试制的七种矿山洗选设备中，也有五种是独立设计的。沈阳重型机器厂独立设计的初轧机，由三十五组机器组成，长一百四十公尺，全重两千多吨，从给料到轧出钢坯来，都是这台机器自己操作。这是我国自行设计制造的第一台全套初轧机。
