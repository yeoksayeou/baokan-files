Of the 593 demobilized soldiers placed at the Benxi Steel Plant, 194 have become activists in socialist construction in the past year, an average of one socialist construction activist for every three demobilized soldiers.

Of the 552 demobilized soldiers engaged in production, approximately 90% originally did not understand production technology, but now have mastered a certain level of skill. Among them, 256 have become skilled technical workers at levels four through seven. Demobilized soldier Wang Yanting, who initially knew nothing about technology upon entering the factory, mastered steel rolling technology in seven or eight months after signing a master-apprentice contract with veteran worker Chang Guofa. He was also recognized as an advanced producer of the factory. In addition to organizing veteran workers to sign master-apprentice contracts with demobilized soldiers and organizing them to participate in amateur technical and cultural studies, the factory also sent them for off-site training to improve their cultural and technical levels in all aspects.

When assigning work to demobilized soldiers, the factory strived to "assign each to their proper place" and "make the best use of their talents," and was very concerned about the lives and welfare of the demobilized soldiers. The labor union distributed more than 3,700 yuan in relief funds to demobilized soldiers in need over the past year. In the fourth quarter of last year, over sixty newly built residential units in the factory were preferentially allocated to forty demobilized soldier households, and through relatives and friends, spouses were introduced to three single demobilized soldiers, enabling them to establish happy families.

    在本溪钢厂工作的复员军人
    大多数人学会技术
    本报讯　安置在本溪钢厂的五百九十三名复员军人，一年来有一百九十四名成为社会主义建设积极分子，平均每三名复员军人当中就有一名社会主义建设积极分子。
    在五百五十二名从事生产的复员军人中，原来有90％左右不懂生产技术的现在已经掌握了一定的技术，其中有二百五十六人已成为四级到七级的熟练技术工人。复员军人王延廷，刚入厂一点不懂技术，自从和老工人常国发签订师徒合同后，教的热心，学的努力，七、八个月就掌握了轧钢技术，还被评为厂的先进生产者。工厂除了组织老工人与复员军人签订师徒合同，组织他们参加业余技术、文化学习外，还送他们去厂外培训，从各方面提高他们的文化技术水平。
    这个厂在给复员军人分配工作时，尽力做到“各得其所”“各尽所长”，对复员军人的生活福利也十分关心。工会对有困难的复员军人，一年来共发放三千七百余元救济款；去年第四季度，厂内新建六十几户住宅优先分配给复员军人四十户，并且通过亲友关系给三名独身复员军人介绍了爱人，使他们建立了幸福的家庭。
