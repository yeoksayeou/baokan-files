Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 5th. More than 120 graduates of the Anshan Iron and Steel Workers' Technical School have completed their skill testing. More than 70% of them passed the Grade 4 worker level, and a dozen outstanding graduates reached the Grade 5 worker level.

These graduates were staff members of Anshan Iron and Steel a year and a half ago. In the first half of 1955, Anshan Iron and Steel streamlined its management structure and called on young staff members to learn technology and directly participate in production. At that time, many staff members submitted applications. In July, they entered the Anshan Iron and Steel Workers' Technical School to study.

The year and a half of study was not smooth sailing. These young people, accustomed to sitting in offices, often felt sore and back pain after swinging a sledgehammer and holding a file in the practice factory for the first time. Liu Shuen, the production administrator of the foundry workshop, couldn't handle the hammer well when he started learning fitter work. He accidentally hit his hand holding the chisel, and the back of his hand swelled as high as a bun. However, when they thought about learning technology to build the motherland, they became energetic. They overcame various difficulties. If they lacked physical strength, they persisted in physical exercise for a long time. If there were not enough tools and raw materials for practice, they made their own tools. The trainees in the electrician class helped the school assemble a laboratory with a distribution board and a generator. They finally mastered the techniques of electrician and fitter work.

### 学好技术　建设祖国  鞍钢许多青年职员成为技术工人

    学好技术　建设祖国
    鞍钢许多青年职员成为技术工人
    新华社鞍山5日电　在鞍山钢铁工人技术学校里，有一百二十多个毕业生结束了考工测验。其中有70％以上的人考上了四级工，还有十几个优秀的毕业生达到五级工的水平。
    这些毕业生在一年半以前是鞍钢的职员。1955年上半年，鞍钢在精简管理机构的同时，号召青年职员学习技术，直接参加生产。当时有很多职员递上了申请书。7月间，他们就进入鞍山钢铁工人技术学校学习。
    一年半的学习过程不是一帆风顺的。这些坐惯了办公室的青年们，第一次在实习工厂里抡着大锤、拿着锉刀干上一天，常常累得腰酸背痛。铸造车间生产管理员刘树恩在开始学钳工时，锤子打不好，一不小心打在把铲的手上，手背肿得像馒头一样高。但是，当他们想到学好技术建设祖国的时候，劲头就来了。他们克服了各种困难。体力不足，就长期坚持体育锻炼。实习的工具和原材料不足，就自己做工具。电工班的学员帮助学校装配了一个有配电盘、发电机的实验室。他们终于熟练地掌握了电工和钳工的技术。
