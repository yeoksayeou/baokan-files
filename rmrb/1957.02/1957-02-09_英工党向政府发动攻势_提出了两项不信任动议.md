Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th. Since the new British Prime Minister Macmillan took office, he has suffered his first serious attack. The Labour Party proposed two motions of no confidence in the government on the evening of the 7th.

    One motion states that the attack on Egypt shows that Britain has misused a large portion of its military expenditure. This motion calls for "significant cost reductions" and the abolition of conscription.

    The second motion of no confidence criticizes the Conservative Party's economic policies. This motion states that the government "is driving up prices and rents, threatening full employment, and depleting the country's gold and dollar reserves."

    Both motions are to be voted on in Parliament next week.

    英工党向政府发动攻势  提出了两项不信任动议
    新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：英国新任首相麦克米伦就职以来第一次遭受到严重的攻击，工党7日晚上向政府提出了两项不信任动议。
    一项动议说，进攻埃及的事件表明，英国滥用了它的军费中很大一部分款项。这项动议要求“大大削减费用”并且废除征兵制。
    第二项不信任动议抨击保守党的经济政策。这项动议说，政府“正在促使物价和房租上涨，威胁充分就业并且耗尽国家的黄金和美元储备。”
    这两项动议都要在下星期在议会表决。
