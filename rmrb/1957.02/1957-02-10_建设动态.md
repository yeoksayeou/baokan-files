Construction Updates

    Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture's Counties Have Unimpeded Roads
    (Reported by this newspaper) The transportation industry in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, developed rapidly in 1956, with newly built roads crisscrossing the entire prefecture.
    In 1956, a total of 369 kilometers of new simple roads were built in the prefecture. Together with the previously built and restored roads, the total length reached 823.2 kilometers, more than four times the length of roads in the entire prefecture before liberation. Now, all counties in the prefecture have access to automobiles, and most districts and some townships also have access. On these roads, trucks fully loaded with passengers, livestock products, and daily necessities travel back and forth every day. Daily necessities favored by the Tibetan people, such as snuff bottles, woolens, silks, and silver ornaments for women, are available. Local specialties and livestock products from these areas are also transported to all parts of the country via these roads.

    Baotou-Lanzhou Railway Construction Stepped Up
    (Reported by this newspaper) The second railway trunk line connecting North China and Northwest China—the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway—is being constructed at an accelerated pace. Construction teams are working simultaneously from the north and south ends. To date, the southern section has crossed China's first large arch bridge—the Yellow River Railway Bridge—passed through thirteen tunnels, and laid tracks to the Dijia Tai Station, the first station specified in the First Five-Year Plan, 82 kilometers from Lanzhou. The northern section has crossed the Urad Front Banner of the Ulanqab League and laid tracks south to the Gongmiaozi Station, 91 kilometers away. The roadbed engineering in both the north and south sections has been constructed for more than 370 kilometers.
    Once this railway is completed, it will be the shortest railway connecting China's Ji'er and Lanxin trunk lines. Taking the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway from Lanzhou to Jining will be more than 1,000 kilometers shorter than taking the Longhai Line and transferring to the Beijing-Hankou Line.

    Fujian Builds Forest Railway
    (Reported by Xinhua News Agency) The dedicated forest railway line extending from Anji Station on the Nanping-Fuzhou Railway to Dazhou Island, the largest timber storage yard in the Fujian forest area, recently started construction. This dedicated line is 2.8 kilometers long and will cross a bridge more than 300 meters long and six culverts.
    Dazhou Island is an oasis in the Minjiang River, four li long and half a li wide, located twelve kilometers east of Nanping. This small island is a good distribution base for timber from the upper reaches of the Minjiang forest area. When the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway was being laid to Nanping, the Fujian Provincial Forestry Industry Department decided to build a large-scale timber storage yard here, which has now been surveyed and will soon begin construction.
    After the storage yard and dedicated line are completed, 300,000 to 400,000 cubic meters of timber will be transported from here to all parts of the country by rail each year.

    Tibet Starts Construction of Bangda-Ningjing Highway
    (Reported by Xinhua News Agency) The highway from Bangda, west of Qamdo, to Ningjing Zong (county) began construction in mid-January and has already been built for fifteen kilometers.
    This highway is approximately 280 kilometers long, starting from Bangda on the Kangding-Tibet highway, passing southeast through Zuogong Zong, crossing the Lancang River to Ningjing Zong (Jiangka). It will traverse two large mountains and pass through many rocky cliffs. It is expected to be completed to Zuogong Zong in the first quarter of this year. The Tibet Military Region is dispatching mechanical units to provide support. The people on both banks of the Lancang River, hearing that the highway will be built to their hometowns, have also actively signed up to participate in road construction.
    It is currently the height of winter on the Kangding-Tibet Plateau. Tibetan and Han workers brave the severe cold, clearing six- to seven-inch-thick snow from the grasslands and using branches to burn and thaw the frozen soil to build the road.
    Bangda is an important pastoral town in the Qamdo area, while Zuogong Zong and Ningjing Zong are major agricultural areas in the Qamdo area, rich in highland barley, wheat, and other crops. Historically, merchants traveling from Yunnan Province have also mostly taken the route through Ningjing Zong to Qamdo. After the completion of the Bangda-Ningjing highway, it will be of great significance for strengthening the material exchange between Qamdo and the lower reaches of the Lancang River, as well as for future connections between Tibet and Sichuan and Yunnan.

    Another Highway Built in Liangshan, Sichuan
    (Reported by Xinhua News Agency) The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province is building a highway from Zhaojue to Butuo. This highway starts from the Sanwan River on the Yibin-Xichang Highway in Zhaojue County and ends in Butuo County, with a total length of more than 30 kilometers.
    This is the second highway built in the autonomous prefecture after the opening of the Yibin-Xichang Highway.
    Butuo is a wealthy county in the southern part of the autonomous prefecture, with the autonomous prefecture's famous and largest Butuo Plain, rich in potatoes, buckwheat, and corn. In the past, transportation to and from the area relied entirely on human labor and pack animals.

    建设动态甘南藏族自治州各县公路畅通
    本报讯　甘肃省甘南藏族自治州1956年交通运输事业发展很快，新建公路已纵横分布全州。
    1956年全州新建简易公路共有三百六十九公里，连同以前新建和恢复的公路达八百二十三点二公里，等于解放前全州公路的四倍还要多。现在，全州各县都能畅通汽车，绝大部分的区和一部分乡也能通汽车了。在这些公路上，每日都有满载旅客和畜产品、日用百货品的汽车往返各地。藏族人民喜爱的鼻烟盒、呢绒、绸缎和妇女们的银饰等生活日用品，都能得到供应。而这些地区的土特产和畜产品也通过公路运到全国各地。
    包兰铁路加紧修建
    本报讯　沟通华北、西北的第二条铁路干线——包（头）兰（州）铁路正在加快修建，施工队伍分南北两头同时并进；截至目前，南段已跨过我国第一座大拱桥——黄河铁桥，穿过十三座隧道，铺轨到第一个五年计划所规定的、距离兰州八十二公里的狄家台车站，北段已越过乌兰察布盟的乌拉特前旗，向南铺轨到九十一公里的公庙子车站。路基工程南北两段已修筑三百七十余公里。
    这条铁路修通后，将是连接我国集二、兰新两条干线的最短铁路，从兰州走包兰路到集宁，要比走陇海转京汉路少一千多公里。

    福建修筑森林铁路
    据新华社讯　从南平—福州铁路的安济车站通向福建林区最大贮木场大洲岛的森林专用铁路线，在最近开工修建。这条专用线全长二点八公里，中间要跨过一座三百多公尺长的大桥和六座涵管。
    大洲岛是闽江中的一个四里长、半里宽的绿洲，位于南平以东十二公里。这个小岛是闽江上游林区木材的良好集散基地。当鹰厦铁路铺轨到南平的时候，福建省森林工业部门就决定在这里修建一座大型贮木场，现在已经勘测完毕，不久就要动工。
    在贮木场和专用线建成以后，每年将有三十万到四十万立方公尺的木材从这里由铁路运往全国各地。
    西藏兴修邦达宁静公路
    据新华社讯　从昌都以西的邦达到宁静宗的公路在1月中旬动工修筑，已修了十五公里。
    这条公路全长约二百八十公里，从康藏公路线上的邦达起，向东南经左贡宗跨澜沧江到宁静宗（江卡），中间要翻两座大山，穿过许多石崖，预计今年第一季度可以修到左贡宗。西藏军区正在调派机械部队前往支援。澜沧江两岸人民听说要把公路修到自己家乡，也积极报名参加修路。
    现在康藏高原上正是隆冬季节，藏族和汉族工人冒着严寒，清除草原上六、七寸厚的积雪，用树枝烧开冻土筑路。
    邦达是昌都地区的重要牧区市镇，左贡宗和宁静宗都是昌都地区的主要农业区，盛产青稞和小麦等作物。历来从云南省来的商旅，也多取道宁静宗来昌都。邦达—宁静公路修成后，对加强昌都和澜沧江下游地区物资交流以及将来西藏同四川、云南的联系都有重大的意义。
    四川凉山又建一条公路
    据新华社讯　四川凉山彝族自治州正在修建一条从昭觉到布拖的公路。这条公路从昭觉县的宜（宾）西（昌）公路上的三湾河起到布拖县城，全长三十多公里。
    这是继宜西公路通车后在自治州修建的第二条公路。
    布拖是自治州南部富庶的县份，有自治州著名的最大的布拖平坝，盛产马铃薯、荞麦和玉米。过去这里和区外交通运输全靠人力和驮马。
