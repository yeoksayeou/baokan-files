    Sichuan Builds Reservoirs on Longquan Mountain
    On Longquan Mountain, which is adjacent to the western Sichuan Plain, five reservoirs are being built to irrigate farmland. In addition, the sites for seven more reservoirs have been surveyed, and they will be built gradually in the future. Two of these reservoirs were completed in 1956 and have begun to store water, so they can irrigate farmland by the time of the spring plowing. After all five reservoirs are completed, they can provide gravity irrigation to more than 55,000 mu of higher-elevation land that cannot be irrigated otherwise.
    This group of reservoirs was jointly requested by more than 300 agricultural cooperatives around Longquan Mountain during the high tide of agricultural cooperation in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956.

    四川龙泉山上兴修水库
    在紧邻川西平原的龙泉山上，正在兴修五个灌溉农田的水库；另外还勘测了七个水库的地址，将在今后逐步兴修。这批水库已经有两个在1956年内完工，并开始蓄水，一到春耕就可以灌溉农田。这五座水库全部完工后，可使五万五千多亩无法灌溉的地势较高的田实行自流灌溉。
    这批水库是1955年冬和1956年春农业合作化高潮中龙泉山周围三百多个农业社联合要求兴修的。
