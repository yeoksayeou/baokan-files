    The Biggest Fear of Difficulties is a Hardworking Person
    Tian Yu
    At one end of Lishi Bridge, a small town in Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, there is a very small Minsheng Rice Mill.
    I visited this factory, which had only sixteen workers and three management personnel, in May of last year. The factory director, Wen Jiliang, told me at the time: The entire factory had only four thousand yuan in assets, and two months ago it owed nearly one thousand yuan in debt. For several months, the workers hadn't received a single cent of their wages...
    However, by the end of the year, they had handed over more than 13,000 yuan in profits to the state.
    How did they turn things around? According to the factory's leaders, "It all depends on the Party's leadership and everyone's efforts. Furthermore, it relies on two words: 'diligence' and 'frugality.'"
    Diligence Opened the Way
    Speaking of diligence, what the workers talked about most was their facing the countryside and opening up the situation from difficulties.
    For a period in the first half of last year, the factory lacked processing tasks, and production almost completely stopped. The factory director actively discussed solutions with the employees. The result was that the only way out was: in operation, serve the countryside; within the factory, rely on the masses, and run the factory diligently and frugally.
    So, taking advantage of the downtime, they studied the nature and tasks of local industry and the worker-peasant alliance. Then they all organized and went to the countryside separately. In the fields, in agricultural cooperatives, and in farmers' homes, they learned about the needs of the farmers while publicizing the nature and tasks of the factory, and established connections with agricultural cooperatives. Finally, a way was found—the farmers said that what bothered them most at the moment was that they didn't have feed for raising pigs. If you could solve this problem, that would be great! Based on this suggestion, the factory borrowed some funds and bought a batch of raw materials to grind rice bran. After overcoming some more difficulties, the number of people coming to buy bran increased day by day, and the number of people bringing rice to the factory for processing gradually increased as well.
    At this time, the workers, encouraged by the upsurge of socialist transformation and the new look of the factory, also put forward the slogan of "more diligence and more frugality." Regardless of whether they were busy or not, the factory always sent people to the countryside to understand the demands of the farmers and listen to their opinions to improve production. One day during the busy "fourth month in the countryside," Director Wen heard farmers in an agricultural cooperative say that they didn't have time to go to the factory to buy bran and processed rice. After returning to the factory, he discussed this issue with the workers. "They are busy, so we will deliver it to their doorsteps!" This suggestion from the workers quickly became a reality. In addition to those operating the machines, everyone else was organized into several groups to deliver loads of feed to the farmers. This not only further expanded sales but also established deep feelings with the farmers.
    The factory also warmly welcomed farmers who came to the factory to process grain. If they needed to eat, the factory helped them cook; if they lived too far away to return, the factory provided accommodation... In order to ensure that the farmers could get more and better quality rice from processing their paddy, the workers studied and improved the machines until late at night, resulting in the quality and rice yield exceeding the standards.
    Over the past year, thanks to the workers' diligent efforts, the factory has won the universal trust of the farmers and earned the glorious comment of "white rice, fine bran, high yield, thoughtful service, and good service." Throughout the year, they processed a total of three million jin of unified bran and more than 344,000 jin of paddy for the farmers, turning the off-season into the peak season and losses into profits.
    Frugality Laid the Foundation
    When the factory was still in a difficult situation, someone suggested to the factory director that he ask the higher authorities to lend some funds. At that time, the factory director said that we haven't made any contribution to the country yet, how can we ask the country to divert construction funds to help us? We must rely on diligence and thrift to solve the problem.
    The factory only had one desk for office work. The factory director asked the accountant to write accounts on it, and when he needed to write something himself, he would run to that dining table to write. Someone said, "Director, buy a desk!" He replied, "We will buy it. Not only desks, but we also have many things to add. However, like a tree, if the roots are not strong and the foundation is not solid, it is unreliable to want green branches, lush leaves, and blooming red flowers."
    Now, the factory's buildings have also changed. All the employees of the factory used their holidays or when they had fewer tasks to build earth foundations and brick walls themselves. Before long, a dilapidated and broken shed became spacious and clean.
    With the development of production, the factory's employee benefits have also improved. Not to mention wages, which are paid twice a month; not to mention medical care and hardship subsidies, people in difficulty always receive help. What particularly excited everyone was that there were dormitories for accommodation, dining halls and tables for eating, and even bathrooms for bathing. However, it didn't cost much money.
    This year, due to last year's poor harvest and difficulties in the supply of raw materials, most of the oil and rice factories in Jiangsu Province have processing tasks that are insufficient for one quarter of production needs. However, the Minsheng Rice Mill has already arranged tasks for the whole year. Their planned total output value and profit to be handed over are even higher than last year.

    困难最怕勤劳人
    天语
    在江苏省靖江县礼士桥这个小镇的一端，有一个很小的民生米厂。
    去年5月间，我到过这个只有十六个工人、三个管理人员的工厂。厂长闻积良当时曾对我说：这个厂一古脑儿是四千元的资财，两个月前欠债倒有近一千元，几个月都发不出一文工人的工资……。
    但是，到了年底，他们给国家上缴了一万三千多元的利润。
    他们是怎样打开局面的呢？据这个厂的领导人员说：“全靠着党的领导和大家的努力。再有就是靠的两个字：一个是‘勤’，一个是‘俭’。”
    勤劳打开了局面
    说到勤，工人们向我谈得最多的是他们面向农村，从艰难中打开局面的事情。
    去年上半年有一个时期，这个厂的加工任务不足，生产几乎全部停了下来。厂长就积极和职工研究解决办法。结果发现出路只有一条：在经营上，为农村服务；在厂内，依靠群众，勤俭办厂。
    于是，趁着停工的时间，他们进行了关于地方工业的性质、任务和工农联盟的学习，接着都组织起来分头下了乡。在田间，在农业社，在农民的家里，他们一面了解农民的需要，一面宣传工厂的性质任务，和农业社建立联系。最后，一个门路找到了——农民们说，眼前大家最伤脑筋的，是养猪没有饲料，要是你们有办法解决这个问题，那可太好了！根据这个意见，厂里就贷了一点资金，买了批原料碾起大糠来。经过又克服了一些困难，上门买糠的人一天比一天增加，到厂加工稻子的人也逐渐多起来。
    这时，为社会主义改造高潮和工厂新面貌鼓舞着的工人们，又提出了“勤上加勤，俭上加俭”的口号。不管闲忙，工厂总要派出人去到农村里了解农民的要求，听取他们的意见来改进生产。一个“乡村四月闲人少”的日子，闻厂长在农业社里听到农民们说没有时间到厂里买糠和机米，回厂以后，他就和工人研究了这个问题。“他们忙，我们就送上门去！”工人们的这个建议很快就成了现实。除了开机生产的，其他的人都编成几个小组，把一车车、一担担的饲料送到农民的手上。这样一来，不但进一步扩大了销路，还同农民建立了深厚的感情。
    到厂里加工粮食的农民，厂里也热情招待。要吃饭，厂里就给代烧；路远实在回不去了，厂里就招待住宿……。为了使农民加工的稻子打得多、打得好，工人们研究改进机器一搞就是半夜，结果使质量、出米率都超过了标准。
    一年来，就凭着工人们这样辛勤的努力，这个工厂赢得了农民们的普遍信任，博得了“米白糠细出率高，招待周到服务好”的光荣的评语。全年一共为农民加工了三百万斤统糠和三十四万四千多斤稻子，使淡季变成了旺季，亏本变成了盈余。
    节俭奠定了根基
    还在工厂处于艰难的境地的时候，有人曾向厂长建议请求上级贷给些款子，当时厂长就表示：我们还没有给国家作出一点贡献，怎么能反而要求国家分散建设资金来帮助我们？我们要靠勤俭节约来解决问题。
    厂里办公只有一张桌子，厂长让会计在上面写账，自己要写个什么，就跑到那张饭桌上去写。有人说：“厂长，买张桌子吧！”他回答说：“要买的。不但桌子，我们要添的东西还多着呢。不过，就像一棵树一样，根没牢，本没固，要想青枝绿叶开红花，那是靠不住的。”
    现在，这个厂的厂房也变了样了。全厂职工们趁假日休息或者任务不多的时候，就自己动手打土基，砌墙头。没有多久，一所烂旧的破棚子就变得又宽敞，又干净。
    随着生产的发展，这个厂的职工福利也有了改进。工资不说了，一月两次照领；医药、困难补助也不说了，困难的人总会得到帮助。特别叫大家兴奋的，是住宿有了宿舍，吃饭有了饭堂、桌子，而且，洗澡也有了浴室。但是，都没有花了几个钱。
    今年，江苏省的油米工厂因为去年农业歉收，原料供应困难，绝大部分厂子的加工任务不足一个季度的生产需要。但是民生米厂全年的任务已经安排好了。他们计划完成的总产值和上缴利润比去年还要高呢。
