Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: The Wenjiang Special District of Sichuan Province has decided to further promote double-season rice on the Western Sichuan Plain this year, expanding the planting area to more than 700,000 mu. The implementation of this plan is expected to increase rice production by more than 100 million jin.

The promotion of double-season rice in the Western Sichuan Plain began last year. Last year, counties on the plain planted more than 100,000 mu on a trial basis, with an average yield of more than 700 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30% over single-season rice. The Second Agricultural Cooperative of the Sixth Village of Xiangyang Township, Guanghan County, harvested more than 1,200 jin of rice per mu on six mu of double-season rice. According to a survey by the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Western Sichuan Plain has little land but a large population, with surplus labor. The plain has the Dujiangyan self-flowing irrigation system, with a frost-free period of about 260 days throughout the year, and an average annual temperature of more than 17 degrees Celsius. There is also confidence in meeting the demand for seeds, fertilizers, and technicians needed for large-scale planting of double-season rice. Therefore, it was decided to plant it on a large scale this year.

At present, agricultural cooperatives on the Western Sichuan Plain are actively preparing for the large-scale planting of double-season rice.

    川西平原去年双季稻亩产量比单季稻高三成多
    今年决定把双季稻扩大到七十万亩
    据新华社成都电　四川省温江专区决定今年在川西平原上进一步推广双季稻，把种植面积扩大到七十万多亩。这个计划实现后约可增产稻谷一亿多斤。
    川西平原推广双季稻是去年开始的，去年平原各县共试种了十万多亩，每亩产量平均在七百斤以上，比单季稻增产三成多。广汉县向阳乡六村第二农业社有六亩双季稻每亩产一千二百多斤稻子。根据中共温江地委的调查，川西平原地少人多，劳力有剩余。平原上有都江堰自流灌溉，全年无霜期在二百六十天左右，常年气温平均在摄氏十七度以上。大量种植双季稻所需的种子、肥料和技术人员，也有把握满足，因此决定在今年大量种植。
    现在，川西平原上的农业社正在积极进行大量种植双季稻的准备工作。
