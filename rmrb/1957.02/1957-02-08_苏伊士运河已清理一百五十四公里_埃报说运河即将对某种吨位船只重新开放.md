Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch from New York: According to a United Nations radio broadcast on the 6th, General Wheeler, the UN representative assisting Egypt in clearing the Suez Canal, announced that 154 kilometers of the Suez Canal have been cleared, which is practically the entire stretch from Port Said to Port Suez. Only two obstacles remain to be cleared.

The Suez Canal, including the artificial waterways at the port entrances at both ends, is 175 kilometers long in total.

Wheeler said he hopes to open a navigable channel in the canal by early March. This was the original target date. He said that 75% of oil tankers would be able to pass through the canal at that time.

Wheeler told the United Nations radio station in Ismailia, in the Suez Canal area, that he believes he can fully guarantee that the entire Suez Canal will be fully navigable by mid-May.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 6th Dispatch: The Egyptian newspaper "Al Shaab" ("The People") today quoted official sources as saying that the Suez Canal will reopen to ships of certain tonnage on February 15.

The report said that the maritime company in Port Taufiq, at the southern end of the Suez Canal, is making preparations for resumption of operations; the port's customs office has resumed normal operations. (Attached picture)

    苏伊士运河已清理一百五十四公里
    埃报说运河即将对某种吨位船只重新开放
    据新华社7日讯　纽约消息：据联合国电台6日广播，协助埃及清理苏伊士运河的联合国代表惠勒将军宣布，苏伊士运河已经清理了一百五十四公里，这实际上差不多就是塞得港到苏伊士港的全程。现在只有两个障碍尚待清除。
    苏伊士运河包括两端港口入口部分的人造航路，全长一百七十五公里。
    惠勒说，他希望能够在3月初以前在运河中开辟一条可以通航的航道。按照原来计划，预定在3月初达到这个目标。他说，那时候将有75％的油船可以通过运河。
    惠勒在苏伊士运河区的伊士美利亚向联合国电台说，他认为他可以完全保证，苏伊士运河到5月中旬全程可以完全通航。
    新华社开罗6日电　埃及“人民报”今天援引官方人士的话说，苏伊士运河将在2月15日对某种吨位的船只重新开放。
    消息说，苏伊士运河南端的托菲克港的海运公司正在进行恢复工作的准备；这个港口的海关已经恢复正常工作。（附图片）
