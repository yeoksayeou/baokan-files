    Eliminating Obstacles to Deepening Leadership
    Many leading comrades in the local industrial system of Tangshan City are eager to step out of their offices and go deep into the grassroots to overcome the situation where leadership lags behind the advanced producer movement. However, they universally complain that they “cannot go deep.” What are the reasons for this? In my opinion, there are at least three obstacles on the objective side.
    First, there are too many meetings. For example, when a meeting is held by a city-level leading organ, a series of meetings will be held at the lower levels. After the Municipal Party Committee holds a meeting, the District Party Committee will convene cadres responsible for Party and mass work in various factories. The Bureau of Industry will convene various companies under its jurisdiction, and the companies will then convene cadres responsible for administrative work in each factory. Sometimes, the District Party Committee also convenes meetings of Party member cadres in Party, government, labor union, and Youth League organizations. When the Bureau of Industry convenes meetings of factory directors, it sometimes invites Party branch secretaries from various factories to participate. After the cadres responsible for Party and mass work and administrative work in each factory return, they have to hold a series of meetings. In addition, the factories under the jurisdiction of various industrial companies are not in the same district, and the meeting times are different, which sometimes causes the phenomenon of branch secretaries waiting for factory directors after returning from meetings, and factory directors waiting for branch secretaries after returning from meetings, so that the instructions from higher levels cannot be earnestly studied and implemented in the factory in a timely manner.
    Second, the upper-level leading organs with detailed divisions of labor often simultaneously make various different demands on the factories, forming a situation where “thousands of threads from above, but only one needle below, and too many threads cannot be threaded.” For example, the Gongjucheng Magnetic Materials Factory has more than 300 people. The factory director also serves as the branch secretary, the deputy branch secretary is full-time, and other committee members are part-time. Not long ago, the District Party Committee asked them for the following materials: the District Party Committee Office wanted a summary of the year's work and a summary of letters and visits; the Ministry of Industry wanted a summary of the year's leadership in the advanced producer movement, with four major categories, ten sub-items, and more than eighty large and small figures; the Organization Department wanted a summary of organizational work, with the outline alone reaching 1,500 words; the Propaganda Department wanted a summary of the year's propaganda work, as well as a summary of the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents; the United Front Work Department wanted a summary of the relationship between public-private cooperation. The latest of these summary outlines was issued to the factory on December 12th last year, but the summary had to be submitted by the 25th. Under such circumstances, the factory leaders are too busy just writing summaries, how can they have time to go deep into leading production?
    Third, the cadres sent by the leading organs to the factories spend more time listening to reports and asking for materials, and less time providing concrete assistance to the factories. The Mechanical and Electrical Company has nearly 40 cadres, but only six factories under its jurisdiction, of which only four are larger. A large group of company cadres goes to the factory. After arriving at the factory, they mostly ask for materials and listen to reports, which takes up a lot of time for the factory leaders. Someone said: "Like this, it is better if the higher-ups do not go deep into the work, if they go deep, we cannot go deep."
    Although we should oppose the ideological style of enterprise leaders who are not hardworking and in-depth, if the higher-level leading organs do not simultaneously try to eliminate these obstacles, it will be relatively difficult for factory leading cadres to go deep into their work. Zilin

    消除深入领导的障碍
    唐山市地方工业系统许多工厂的领导同志，很想走出办公室，深入下去，克服领导落后于先进生产者运动的局面，但是普遍喊“深入不下去”。这是什么原因呢？据我看，在客观方面，至少有三个障碍。
    一是会议多。例如，市级领导机关开一个会，下边就要开一连串的会。市委开过会以后，区委就要召集各厂作党群工作的干部开会，工业局就召集所属各公司开会，各公司再分别召集各厂作行政工作的干部开会；有时候，区委还召开党、政、工、团组织里的党员干部会，工业局召开厂长会议的时候，有时也邀请各厂支部书记参加；各厂作党群工作、行政工作的干部回去以后，还要开一系列的会。加以各工业公司所属的厂不在一个区，开会时间又不一样，有时就造成支部书记开会回来等厂长，厂长开会回来等支部书记的现象，使上级的指示在厂里反而不能及时进行认真的研究贯彻。
    二是分工细密的上级领导机关常常同时向厂里提出各种不同的要求，形成“上边千条线，下边一根针，线多引不进”的局面。例如公巨成磁厂有三百多人，厂长兼支部书记，副支书专职，其他委员都是兼职。不久以前，区委曾经向他们要如下的材料：区委办公室要全年工作总结和来信来访总结；工业部要全年领导先进生产者运动的总结，内容为四大类，十小项，大小数字八十余个；组织部要组织工作总结，提纲即长达一千五百字；宣传部除了要全年宣传工作总结，还要“八大”文件学习总结；统战部要公私合作共事关系总结。这些总结提纲最迟的到去年12月12日才发到厂，可是25日就要把总结交上去。在这种情况下，工厂领导人员只是写总结就忙不过来，又怎么有时间去深入领导生产呢？
    三是领导机关下厂的干部听汇报、要材料多，对厂里具体帮助少。机铁公司有近四十名干部，所辖厂只有六个，其中较大的厂又只有四个。公司的干部一下厂就是一大群。到工厂以后，又多是要材料，听汇报，这就占用了工厂领导人员的很多时间。有人说：“像这个样子，上边不深入工作还好些，他们一深入，我们就不能深入了。”
    尽管应该反对企业领导人员不艰苦深入的思想作风，但是，如果上级领导机关不同时来设法消除这些障碍，工厂领导干部要深入到工作中去也是比较困难的。　子林
