Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. The East China Sea fishing grounds are bathed in spring sunshine, and large schools of small yellow croaker are being discovered moving from south to north. From the sea near Dachen Island to the area around Shenjiamen Port on Zhoushan Island, more than 1,000 pairs of wooden sailing boats and over 40 pairs of motorized sailing boats from Zhejiang and Fujian provinces are setting sail to search and capture them. Initial net trials have already yielded a number of bountiful catches.

The spring small yellow croaker fishing season is one of the main fishing seasons in the East China Sea, lasting for more than five months. This year, various fishery cooperatives made thorough preparations early on. The boats that had been catching hairtail during the winter returned to their cooperatives and quickly set out to sea again to engage in the spring small yellow croaker fishing season production. This is something that had not happened in the past.

    东海渔场春季小黄鱼汛开始
    据新华社杭州电　东海渔场上春光明媚，小黄鱼群正由南而北地大量被发现。从大陈岛附近的海面到舟山岛沈家门港口一带，浙江、福建两省有一千多对木帆船和四十多对机帆船在扬帆搜捕。下网初试，就已经出现了不少丰产成绩。
    春季小黄鱼汛是东海的主要鱼汛之一，捕鱼时间连续五个多月。今年各渔业社及早做好充分准备，冬季捕带鱼的船只刚返航回社，很快地就又出海投入捕小黄鱼的春汛生产。这是过去没有过的事情。
