Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 8th. The Yemeni Legation in Egypt issued a statement on the 7th, suggesting direct negotiations with Britain to arrange a ceasefire and resolve the dispute between the two countries over the Aden issue.

The statement said: "If Britain does not agree to hold direct negotiations, in accordance with the 1934 treaty (regarding the friendship between the two countries) to resolve outstanding issues, then Yemen will submit its issue to the United Nations."

The statement said that Yemen would not negotiate a ceasefire with the "so-called Aden government." Yemen has repeatedly stated that the so-called "Aden Protectorate" is Yemeni territory occupied by Britain.

On the same day, the Yemeni Legation in Britain issued a statement to the press saying that British troops "are still continuing their aggression," launching attacks near Harib with aircraft, tanks and machine guns. These attacks are directed against Natia, Norman and Jamaliyat on the Harib border.

The statement also said: "British troops have resumed their offensive against Tahrif on February 5. The British authorities are attempting further aggression against the Bayda area."

    也门建议同英国谈判停火
    新华社开罗8日电　也门驻埃及公使馆7日发表声明，建议同英国举行直接谈判以便安排停火和解决两国在亚丁问题上的争论。
    声明说：“如果英国不同意举行直接谈判，根据1934年（关于两国的友好的）条约来解决悬而未决的问题，那么也门将把它的问题提交联合国。”
    这个声明说，也门不会同“所谓亚丁政府”谈判停火。也门曾经一再申明，所谓“亚丁保护地”是被英国占领的也门领土。
    也门驻英国公使馆同一天向报界发表的一篇声明说，英国部队“仍然在继续进行它们的侵略”，用飞机、坦克和机关枪在哈里布附近发动进攻。这些进攻是针对哈里布边界上的纳提亚、诺曼和贾马利亚特的。
    声明还说：“英国部队在2月5日又重新恢复对塔希弗进攻。英国当局正企图进一步侵略贝达地区。”
