    Scenery of the Motherland
    The Weng River originates in Lianping County, Guangdong Province, and flows into the North River near Yingde County, with a length of 150 kilometers. The Weng River has abundant water, and the river water will not dry up even in winter. The scenery along the river is very beautiful. The agricultural products and bamboo and wood produced on both banks are transported to various places through the Weng River. Guo Weiqi (Manuscript from Southern Daily)

    祖国风光
    滃江发源于广东省连平县，在英德县附近流入北江，长一百五十公里。滃江水量丰富，冬天江水也不会枯竭。沿江风景很优美。两岸出产的农产品和竹木材，都通过滃江运送到各地。　　郭伟祺（南方日报社稿）
