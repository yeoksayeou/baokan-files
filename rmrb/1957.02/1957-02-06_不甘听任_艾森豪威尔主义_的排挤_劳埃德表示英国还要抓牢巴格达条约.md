Xinhua News Agency, London, 5th: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd stated on the 4th that, despite the "Eisenhower Doctrine," Britain remains determined to maintain its relationship with the Baghdad Pact in the Middle East.

According to American news agencies, some American officials believe Britain should withdraw from the Baghdad Pact to pave the way for promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Lloyd yesterday rejected a Labor Party request in the House of Commons to re-examine Britain's relationship with the Baghdad Pact member states. He said that Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy's statement that "Britain will continue to be a member of this treaty" was "well said."

Lloyd also spoke about the seven-nation proposal passed by the United Nations General Assembly. He did not mention the first proposal, which called for Israel to withdraw its troops, but only said that the second proposal, which called for the deployment of United Nations forces on the Israeli-Egyptian armistice line, was "not clear enough" but was "constructive."

At the House of Commons meeting on the 4th, the British government also rejected a Labor MP, Mikardo's, request to lift the trade "embargo" against China.

    不甘听任“艾森豪威尔主义”的排挤
    劳埃德表示英国还要抓牢巴格达条约
    新华社5日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德4日表示，尽管有了“艾森豪威尔主义”，英国仍旧决心保持它在中东的巴格达条约中的关系。
    据美国通讯社报道，某些美国官员认为英国应该退出巴格达条约，这样来为推行“艾森豪威尔主义”铺平道路。
    劳埃德昨天在下院拒绝工党提出的重新审查英国同巴格达条约成员国的关系的要求。他说，巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底所说的“英国将继续是这个条约的成员”这句话“说得很好”。
    劳埃德还谈到联合国大会通过的七国提案问题。他没有提到要以色列撤军的第一项提案，而只是说，要求派遣联合国部队驻在以色列—埃及停战线上的第二项提案还“不够明确”，然而却是“建设性”的。
    在4日下院的会议上，英国政府还拒绝了工党议员米卡多提出的解除对中国的贸易“禁运”的要求。
