Every Item Has a Resolution, Every Case Has an Explanation:
Jiangsu Seriously Handles People's Representatives' Proposals

(Reported by this newspaper) At the fourth session of the First Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress held in August last year, the 250 proposals put forward by the representatives have now been seriously dealt with, achieving a situation where every item has a resolution and every case has an explanation.

Many proposals and opinions reflected situations and problems that the government had not yet discovered, or although had discovered, did not understand in detail, which played a certain role in improving government work and promoting socialist construction. For example, People's Representative Zhang Jingli proposed that some machinery and factory equipment in the province were not being utilized, resulting in great waste. The Provincial Textile Industry Bureau conducted an investigation based on this opinion and confirmed that some textile enterprises did indeed have vacant factory buildings and idle equipment. The vacant factory buildings could install 92,800 spindles, and there were 749 idle looms. Therefore, it was decided to expand the spindles and replace manual wooden looms with looms in a planned way. People's Representative Wen Zhongrang proposed mobilizing all workers in the province to save a portion of their retroactive wage payments. The Provincial People's Bank and the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions accepted this suggestion and vigorously carried out publicity and education on saving and deposit among workers. As a result, from September to mid-December last year, the province increased deposits by 17.5 million yuan, accounting for one-fifth of the total increase in deposits in the past four years. Representatives Fan Guquan, Zheng Dexiang, Tang Junyuan and others criticized the fact that the unreasonable purchase prices of medicinal materials stipulated by the province had affected the unsalability of dozens of medicinal materials. After repeated investigations and studies, the Jiangsu Provincial Company of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, in addition to explaining other reasons for the unsalability of medicinal materials to representatives such as Fan Guquan, adjusted the prices of more than 100 kinds of medicinal materials successively. The reasonable adjustment of purchase prices stimulated the development of medicinal material production. For example, after raising the purchase price of codonopsis pilosula, Zhenjiang alone purchased only 40 dan in 1955, but it increased to 652 dan in 1956.

For some proposals or opinions that could not be handled at present due to financial and material constraints, governments at all levels, in addition to adopting the correct parts, also provided explanations and clarifications to the people's representatives. Generally, they contacted the proposers twice, and in some cases, three to four times. For example, some representatives proposed allocating funds to build theaters and cinemas, increase transportation routes, and build a large number of workers' dormitories, etc. The relevant departments made realistic explanations to the people's representatives.

These proposals were able to be dealt with in a timely and correct manner mainly because the Provincial People's Committee attached importance to this work. The Provincial People's Committee extracted and summarized 205 opinions from the criticisms and suggestions made by the people's representatives at the conference, and frequently urged the relevant units to handle them conscientiously.

### 件件有着落　案案有交代  江苏认真处理人民代表提案

    件件有着落　案案有交代
    江苏认真处理人民代表提案
    本报讯　在去年8月份召开的江苏省第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上，代表们提出来的二百五十件提案，现在已经作了认真处理，做到了件件有着落、案案有交代。
    不少提案和意见反映了政府还没有发现的或虽然已经发现但是了解得不够详细的情况和问题，对改进政府工作、推动社会主义建设起了一定作用。如省人民代表张敬礼提出本省有些机器和厂房的设备没有加以利用，浪费很大。省纺织工业局根据这个意见进行调查了解，证明纺织企业中确有一部分空余厂房及闲置设备，空余厂房可安装纱锭九万二千八百枚、闲置的布机有七百四十九台，因而决定扩建纱锭和有计划地把布机代替人力木机。省人民代表文中让提出了发动全省职工将补发工资的一部分进行储蓄的提案，省人民银行和省工会联合会接受了这个建议，即在职工中大力进行节约储蓄的宣传教育，结果从去年9月至12月中旬止，全省共增加存款一千七百五十万元，占全省四年来存款增加总额的五分之一。范谷泉、郑德翔、唐君远等代表批评了由于省里规定的药材收购价格不合理而影响了几十种药材脱销的情况，中国药材公司江苏省公司经过多次调查研究，除了向范谷泉等代表解释了药材脱销的其他原因外，先后调整了一百余种药材价格，由于收购价格的合理调整，刺激了药材生产的发展，如党参收价调高后，单以镇江一地来说，1955年只收购了四十担，1956年即增长到六百五十二担。
    对于因财力、物力限制而目前还不能办理的一些提案或意见，各级政府除采纳正确部分外，还向人民代表作了解释和说明，一般都和提案人联系过两次，多的联系到三次至四次。例如有的代表提议拨款兴建剧场和影院、增加交通路线、兴修大批职工宿舍等等，有关部门向人民代表作了实事求是的交代。
    这些提案所以能得到及时正确的处理，主要因为省人民委员会重视这个工作，省人民委员会从人民代表在大会发言的批评和建议中，摘录归纳成二百零五条意见，并经常督促各有关单位认真处理。
