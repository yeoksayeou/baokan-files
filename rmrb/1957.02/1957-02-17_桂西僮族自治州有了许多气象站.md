Xinhua News Agency report: The Guangxi Provincial Meteorological Bureau has selected the sites for eleven weather and climate stations in remote mountainous areas of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, including Longlin and Sanjiang. Construction is underway. The number of meteorological observatories, stations, and climate stations distributed across the forty-two counties of Guixi has increased from eleven to thirty last year. Although these new stations lack equipment and have relatively difficult working conditions, their weather forecasting work has been completed relatively well over the past year. At the Luodong climate station, it takes half a day to walk back and forth to fetch a load of water, and six *li* to get a meal. However, the staff does not slacken their work because of this. They once worked continuously for seventeen nights to ensure the quality of frost forecasts. As a result, areas using the station's forecast materials did not experience deaths of draught cattle from frost, and crops were also protected from frost damage. Climate stations established in Ningming, Longjin, and other counties in the southern part of the autonomous prefecture are conducting phenological observations and accumulating data on the cultivation of tropical crops such as rubber and Sea Island cotton while also making agricultural meteorological forecasts.
   The number of meteorological technicians from minority nationalities in the various stations of the autonomous prefecture is also increasing day by day. Of the one hundred and eighty-one junior cadres trained by the Provincial Meteorological Bureau in this term, one hundred and twenty-seven are cadres from Zhuang, Hui, and other ethnic groups; the three hundred and eighty junior cadres from various ethnic groups trained last year are also performing well in their work.

    桂西僮族自治州有了许多气象站
    据新华社讯　广西省气象局已在桂西僮族自治州隆林、三江等边远山区选定十一个气象站、气候站地址，建站工作正在进行。分布在桂西四十二个县的气象台、站和气候站，去年已由十一个增加到三十个。这些新站虽然器材不足，工作条件也比较艰苦，但是一年来气象预报工作完成的都比较好。洛东气候站，挑一担水来回得走半天，吃一顿饭要走六里路。但是工作人员并不因此而放松工作，曾经为了保证霜冻预报质量，连续工作十七个夜晚。结果，采用这个站预报材料的地区，都没有冻死耕牛，也防护了农作物免受冻害。设在自治州南部的宁明、龙津等县的气候站，在进行农业气象预测的同时，还对橡胶、海岛棉等热带作物的培植进行物候观测和积累资料工作。
    自治州各台、站的少数民族气象技术干部也日益增多。省气象局本期培养的一百八十一个初级干部中，僮、回等族干部有一百二十七人；去年培养的三百八十名各族初级干部，工作中的表现也很好。
