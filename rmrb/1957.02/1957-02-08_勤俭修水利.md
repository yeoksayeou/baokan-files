　　(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Fujian Daily, Xinglin Township in Hui'an County has been paying attention to diligence and thrift in the construction of water conservancy projects. Currently, the township has saved more than 1,100 yuan in construction costs, equivalent to 25% of the total project cost.

　　The five newly built mountain ponds and check dams in Meiren, Tazinei and other villages of Xinglin Township originally planned to use stone blocks for the spillways. Later, after detailed investigation and design, the spillways were built on a solid foundation, saving more than 300 yuan from this item alone. At the same time, they also created the use of "I-beam gates" to replace rotating gates, which is not only convenient for water discharge but also saves more than 500 yuan. Without affecting the quality of the water conservancy project, the township also put forward the slogan of "reviving old stones and turning dead treasures into living treasures". At present, the masses in the township have collected more than 4,000 old stones, which has also saved a part of the expenditure.

    勤俭修水利
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：惠安县杏林乡在兴修水利中注意勤俭，现在全乡已节省工程费用一千一百多元，等于全部工程费的25％。
    杏林乡的美仁、塔仔内等村新建的五个山塘、谷坊，原计划溢洪道砌石块，后来经过详细勘查设计，把溢洪道建设在坚实的基础上，单这项就省掉三百多元。同时，他们还创造了用“工字闸”来代替转动门闸，这样不但放水便利，而且还可节省五百多元。在不影响水利工程质量的条件下，这乡还提出“叫旧石翻身、把死宝变活宝”的口号。现在全乡群众已收集了旧石头四千多块，这也省下了一部分的开支。
