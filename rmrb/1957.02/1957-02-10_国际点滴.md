	The Reading Habits of West Germans
	The West German weekly "Parliament" recently conducted a survey on the reading habits of West Germans. The weekly stated: "According to the survey results, one-third of West German families do not own a single book, this one-third includes six million families, about 17 million people... 11% own fewer than ten books, 22% own fewer than thirty books, and 20% own fewer than one hundred books." "So who is reading?" the weekly asked, and then answered: "Besides those who read pulp fiction and bestsellers, basically no one."
	Japanese Women's "Kimono Fever"
	After the war, under the American occupation of Japan, the "American way of life" prevailed, and many Japanese women, in pursuit of "fashion," stopped wearing Japanese kimonos with their distinctive national characteristics and stopped styling their hair in "Japanese hairstyles." However, this January was very different from previous years. Whether on the street or in offices, one could see many women wearing brightly colored kimonos and with "Japanese hairstyles." Liking kimonos and "Japanese hairstyles" has begun to become a trend. The Japanese call this "Kimono Fever." Famous Japanese writer Hiroshi Minami believes that this is one of the manifestations of the increased national consciousness of the Japanese people.

    日本妇女的“和服热”
    战后日本在美国占领下，“美国生活方式”盛行，许多日本妇女为求“时髦”，早就不穿有鲜明民族特点的日本和服和梳“日本发”了。但是，今年1月却和往年大不相同，无论在街上或是在机关里，都可以看到许多穿着鲜艳的和服、梳着“日本发”的妇女。喜欢和服和梳“日本发”已经开始成为一种风气。日本人把这叫做“和服热”。日本名作家南博认为，这是日本人民民族意识的增强的表现之一。
