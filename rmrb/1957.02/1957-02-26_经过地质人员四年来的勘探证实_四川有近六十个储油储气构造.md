Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th - Sichuan petroleum geological exploration personnel, after four years of hard work, have confirmed that there are nearly sixty promising geological structures for oil and natural gas storage within Sichuan. This year, the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau will concentrate its efforts on further clarifying the oil and gas reservoirs in the Petroleum Gully - Dongxi area of Ba County and the Huangguashan area of Yongchuan County in eastern Sichuan. During the drilling process of these two gas reservoirs, each well has revealed a large amount of natural gas and oil shows, and some wells have also found very valuable white condensate gasoline. This type of oil can be used to drive cars without refining; with slight refining, it can be used to fuel airplanes.
	The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau has carried out deep well drilling on several representative geological structures over the past four years, and has confirmed that the Shengdengshan area of Longchang contains valuable natural gas. The carbon black produced using this natural gas now has a quality approaching international standards. Last year, Sichuan petroleum geological exploration personnel also found an oil-bearing zone with an area of more than 1,000 square kilometers in central Sichuan, and the underground oil content in this zone is extremely rich. At the same time, various shallow wells drilled in northwestern Sichuan have also discovered varying degrees of crude oil shows, and one inclined well extracted more than 20 tons of crude oil during an oil test. The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau has decided to conduct trial refining there this year.

    经过地质人员四年来的勘探证实
    四川有近六十个储油储气构造
    新华社成都24日电　四川石油地质勘探人员经过四年来的辛勤工作，已经证实在四川境内有近六十个有希望的储油和储天然气的地质构造。今年，四川石油勘探局将集中力量进一步探清川东巴县石油沟——东溪和永川县黄瓜山两个天然气藏。这两个气藏在钻探过程中，每口井都曾经发现大量的天然气和石油显示，有些井内还发现有非常宝贵的白色凝析汽油。这种油不经提炼就可用来开汽车；稍加提炼就可以供飞机使用。
    四川石油勘探局四年来曾经在几个具有代表性的地质构造上进行深井钻探，已经证实了隆昌圣灯山储有珍贵价值的天然气。现在用这种天然气制造的碳黑，质量接近国际标准。去年，四川石油地质勘探人员还在川中地区找到一个面积达一千多平方公里的储有石油的地带，在这个地带的地下含油量极丰富。同时在川西北钻探的各口浅井，也发现了不同程度的原油显示，有一口斜井在试油中提捞出二十多吨原油。四川石油勘探局决定今年在那里进行试炼。
