Reader Letters

    Improving the Technical Skills of Medical Personnel

    I am a young medical assistant. In the spring of 1953, I graduated and started working in the countryside. In the district health center where I work, there is an older doctor besides me and another medical assistant. The three of us are responsible for the medical work of the entire district. In the summer, sometimes there are more than one hundred outpatient and home visits a day. However, due to our limited professional and technical level, the therapeutic effect is not satisfactory. We feel even more helpless, especially when encountering seriously ill patients or difficult cases.

    Every medical worker has a common feeling: when the patients we personally treat recover their health under our diagnosis and treatment, we feel most happy; conversely, when we feel helpless about the suffering of patients, or when the diagnosis is unclear and we cannot draw conclusions, how uncomfortable we feel, and our hearts are filled with infinite apologies to the patients. However, to achieve miraculous cures, in addition to hard work, one must have rich treatment experience and a high technical level. Therefore, young rural medical workers like me, how much we hope to have the opportunity to improve our technical level!

    Over the past few years, I have been determined to study on my own, but due to my limited theoretical level, I cannot deeply understand the reference materials I read, and there is nowhere to ask when encountering difficult problems. This kind of superficial learning method has very little effect. At the same time, there are very few books and periodicals that are suitable for practical application and for reference by intermediate medical personnel.

    I hope that the health leaders can deeply care about our group of intermediate medical personnel in the countryside, help us improve our medical technical level, so that we can do more for the vast masses of rural people.

    Suggestions on Book Design

    When you open the first page of a book, it is mostly a title page, a table of contents, or first a flyleaf, then a title page, a table of contents, a publisher's note, an editor's note, and finally a copyright page. This does create a sense of beauty. However, under the current situation of such tight paper supply, I think some books can omit these decorative pages.

    The "Basic Knowledge of Agricultural Production Technology" series published by the Finance and Economics Publishing House, as far as I have seen the second, sixteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twentieth volumes, if each book cancels the title page, prints the editor's note in a smaller font on the second cover page, and prints the copyright uniformly on the fourth cover page, it can save a lot of paper.

    Of course, some ancient books still need to maintain their original style. However, some books recently published by the Ancient Books Publishing House are somewhat wasteful. For example, the book "Selected Poems and Annotations," the main text is only sixty-five pages, but flyleaves, title pages, tables of contents, copyrights, etc. take up eight pages, including eight sides of blank paper with not a single word. If the blank pages are also used, at least five pages can be saved without destroying the original style of the ancient book.

    Some popular booklets have very short texts, but the paper used for title pages, tables of contents, etc. accounts for more than 20% of the total paper used in the book. The book "Our Methods of Promoting Advanced Experience" published by the Workers' Publishing House has a total of 12,000 words and 10 pages. If the title page is cancelled, the table of contents is printed on the second cover page, and the content summary and copyright are printed on the fourth cover page, two sheets of paper can be saved, accounting for 20% of the total paper used in the book.

    I am not advocating that all books should cancel flyleaves and title pages. Some important books that need to be preserved for a long time, such as classic works and some famous works, need to maintain their design requirements, but they should also save paper as much as possible. For some popular booklets, especially those with large print runs, special attention should be paid to saving paper and lowering book prices. Gao Ming

    Too Frequent Replacement of Farmers' Textbooks

    Why are farmers' textbooks not selling? One reason is that the education administrative departments replace textbooks too frequently. For example, in 1955, the education administrative department first decided to adopt the "Farmers' Quick Literacy Textbook" and "Farmers' Literacy Reading Textbook" published by the Liaoning People's Publishing House. Just as the Xinhua Bookstore had just stocked the goods, the education administrative department instructed not to adopt these two textbooks, but to adopt the "Farmers' Literacy Textbook" published by the People's Education Publishing House. Before the newly adopted textbook had time to be distributed, the education administrative department instructed to adopt the "Work Point Textbook." Due to the repeated replacement of textbooks, it has brought great difficulties to the bookstores. For example, the Xinhua Bookstore Liuhe branch has a backlog of eight types of farmers' language textbooks, 22,200 copies; and two types of political textbooks, 4,000 copies. It is unknown when these farmers' textbooks will sell a single copy, so they can only sleep in the warehouse for a long time or be sold as waste paper.

    For this reason, we hope that the education administrative department will carefully compile and determine farmers' textbooks, and do not replace them as in the past, deciding to adopt them today and replacing them tomorrow or the day after.

    提高医务人员技术水平
    我是一个年轻的医士。1953年春，我毕业后就在农村中工作。在我所工作的区卫生所里，除了我和另一个医士之外，还有一个年老的医生。我们三个人负责全区的医疗工作。夏季里有时候每天的门诊和出诊共一百多人次。但是，由于我们的业务技术水平有限，疗效不能令人满意，特别是遇有重病人或疑难症，更感束手无策。
    每个医务人员都有一个共同的感受：当我们亲自处理的患者，在我们的诊断治疗下恢复了健康的时候，我们的心情最为愉快了；反之，当我们对病人的疾苦感到束手无策，或是对病情诊断不明，没法下结论的时候，我们的心情是多么地难受，内心充满着对病人的无限歉疚。然而，要做到起手回春，除了辛勤劳动，还得有丰富的治疗经验和较高的技术水平。因此，像我这样年轻的乡村医务工作者，多么希望有提高技术水平的机会啊！
    几年来我曾经下定决心自学，然而由于理论水平有限，阅读参考材料不能深刻理解，碰到疑难问题又无处求问，这种不求甚解的学习方法，效果就很小了。同时适合实际应用，适合于中级医务人员参考的书刊又极少。
    希望卫生领导机关能够深切关心到我们这批为数不少的在乡村中的中级医务人员，帮助我们提高医疗技术水平，使我们能够更好地为农村中广大群众做更多的事情。

    对书籍设计的建议
    翻开一本书的第一页大都是扉页、目录，或者是先环衬，然后扉页、目录、出版者的话、编者的话，最后又有一张版权页。这的确使人产生一种美感。可是在目前纸张如此紧张的情况下，我认为某一些书似乎可以取消这些装饰页。
    财政经济出版社出版的一套“农业生产技术基本知识”，就我看到的第二、十六、十七、十九、二十等六个分册来说，如果每本书取消扉页，把编者的话用小一号字排印在封二上，版权一律印在封四上，就可以节省许多纸张。
    一些古籍当然还有必要保持其原有的风格。最近古籍出版社出版的一些书，却有些浪费。如“诗选与校笺”一书，正文只有六十五页，而环衬、扉页、目录、版权等却用了八页，其中有八面一个字没有的白纸。如果把空白页也利用上，至少可节省五页，也不会破坏古籍原有的风格。
    有些通俗小册子，正文很短，扉页、目录等用纸竟占全书用纸量的20％以上。工人出版社出版的“我们推广先进经验的方法”一书，全书一万二千字，共十页，如果把扉页取消，目录印在封二上，内容提要和版权印在封四上，就可以节省两张纸，占全书用纸量的20％。
    我并不主张把所有的图书的环衬、扉页一律取消，一些需要长远保存的重要书籍，如经典著作和一些名著等，有必要保持其设计上的要求的，但也应当尽可能地节省纸张。对一些通俗的特别是印数很大的小册子，应当特别注意节约纸张、降低书价。　羔　鸣
    农民课本更换太繁
    农民课本为什么卖不出去呢？教育行政部门对课本的更换太频繁是一个原因。如1955年教育行政部门先确定采用辽宁人民出版社出版的“农民速成识字教材”和“农民识字阅读课本”。新华书店刚刚进货，教育行政部门又指示不采用这两种课本，要采用人民教育出版社出版的“农民识字课本”，新采用的课本还没有来得及发行，教育行政部门又指示采用“记工课本”。由于课本一次又一次的更换，给书店带来了很大的困难。如新华书店柳河支店，积压农民语文课本八种，两万二千二百册；政治课本两种，四千册。这些农民课本不知何年何月才卖掉一本，只好让它们长期地睡在仓库里或者当成废纸卖掉。
    为此，我们希望教育行政部门，要认真编审和确定农民课本，不要再像往日那样，今天确定采用了，明天或后天又来更换。
