Nanjing Chemical Plant Reduces Raw Material Consumption Quotas

    (Our report) The entire staff of the state-owned Nanjing Chemical Plant has excellently fulfilled the January quota targets for various major raw materials. They have also actively sought substitutes and improved the utilization rate of raw materials to overcome the difficulties caused by material shortages.

    The plant's main products are rubber antioxidants and dye intermediates. In January, the supply of a quarter of the major raw materials was insufficient. The plant's leadership foresaw this situation at the end of last year and convened a factory-wide workers' representative assembly and a production increase and economy drive conference. They educated the workers on the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy ideologically. They studied and determined that the production of products lacking raw materials this year should focus on saving raw materials, reducing consumption quotas, and increasing pot yield. The main raw material for manufacturing aminophenol in the amino workshop – carbon dioxide – is expensive and difficult to buy on the market. Sodium hydrosulfide is also often in short supply. Engineer Wu Jingguang's leading key group, after multiple experiments, found that hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid could be used to replace carbon dioxide, and sodium bisulfite could be used to replace sodium hydrosulfide. These two substitutes are abundant in supply, which can double the production of aminophenol, and the price is cheap and the quality meets the requirements. Using sulfuric acid instead of carbon dioxide alone can save more than 1,600 yuan per month. In the past, due to insufficient raw materials, aminophenol had never reached the specified production target. The state had to compensate more than 2,000 yuan for each pot produced. In January, the method of adding water-soluble metacarbonate was used, which reduced the number of washings. The average pot yield was 15 kilograms more than the planned target, which can save the state more than 66,000 yuan per month. In the nitration workshop, due to the strengthening of intermediate product analysis control and the implementation of the "slight sweating" method for nitro crystal proposed by veteran workers Xia Zhonggeng and Hu Guanghua, none of the only two products were substandard throughout the month, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in history. Thanks to the various efforts of the plant's staff, although production was reduced and some varieties were suspended due to insufficient raw material supply, the pot yields of eight major products in January all exceeded the plan, and the raw material consumption quotas for seven types were lower than in December last year.

    南京化工厂原料消耗定额降低
    本报讯　国营南京化工厂全体职工比较出色地完成了1月份各种主要原材料的定额指标，并积极寻找代用品和提高原材料的利用率，克服原料不足的困难。
    这个厂生产的主要产品是橡胶防老剂和染料中间体，1月份有四分之一的主要原料供应不足。这种情况，厂的领导人员在去年年底就预料到了的，并召开了全厂职工代表大会和增产节约行动大会，教育职工从思想上认识到增产节约的重大意义，研究并确定了今年缺乏原材料的产品的生产应以节约原材料、降低消耗定额、提高锅产率为工作重点。氨基车间制造氨基酚的主要原料——二氧化碳，价格贵，市场上很难买到，硫氢化钠也经常供应不足，工程师吴景光领导的关键小组，经过多次试验，找到了可以用盐酸和硫酸代替二氧化碳，用亚硫酸氢钠代替硫氢化钠，这二种代用品货源充足，可以使氨基酚的产量提高一倍，而且价格便宜，质量符合要求。单以用硫酸代替二氧化碳一项，每月就可节省一千六百多元。过去，因为原料不足，氨基酚一直达不到规定的生产指标，每生产一锅，国家要赔二千多元，1月份使用了先加水溶介碳酸盐的方法，减少了洗涤的次数，平均锅产率比计划指标多十五公斤，每月可为国家节约六万六千多元。硝化车间由于加强了中间品分析的控制和实现了老工人夏忠耕、胡光华提出的对硝基结晶采用“轻微发汗”的方法后，仅有的二种产品全月无一台次货，这是历史上从未有过的现象。由于全厂职工多方面的努力，虽然因原料供应不足而减产和部分品种停工，但1月份八种主要产品的锅产量都超过计划，原料消耗定额有七种都比去年12月份有所降低。
