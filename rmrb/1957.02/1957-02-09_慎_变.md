    Be Cautious About "Changing"	Kong Sang
    Unstable plans and too many changes are a major source of waste. During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, it is hoped that the agencies responsible for drafting and deciding on plans will also tap into this area's potential.
    How much potential is there in this area? It's difficult to estimate this. Here are just two examples to give a general idea.
    Construction of the Erdaogouzi vertical shaft in the Jixi Coal Mine began in April of last year. On July 11th, an instruction was received from superiors to immediately halt construction; and it was decided to dismantle all semi-permanent buildings such as lath houses, and transport all materials and equipment back to the warehouse. Unexpectedly, ten days later, while the construction site was busy with dismantling and transportation, superiors issued another instruction to resume construction. Shortly after resuming construction, on September 12th, another instruction was received to halt construction. With these starts and stops, the loss from transportation costs and dismantling alone amounted to more than 55,000 yuan.
    The Fifth Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry is a large design organization of nearly a thousand people. In four years, it has completed nearly twenty preliminary designs, five technical designs, and three construction designs. However, due to changes in plans, only two of these designs were "finished products," and the rest were scrapped. Not counting the waste of design manpower, the agency's expenses alone for these four years amounted to nearly ten million yuan.
    There are also some factories that need to be renovated, but have been delayed for years because the product plan cannot be finalized, and they remain the same to this day. If a decision had been made earlier, not only would the expansion projects have been completed long ago, and the products could have alleviated the current tight supply of national materials, but even the expansion investment would have been recovered long ago.
    Our country's planned construction started not long ago, and many comrades lack experience and have not yet grasped the laws of economic development. Changes in plans are difficult to avoid. However, are all plan changes unavoidable? Can we summarize some lessons learned so that there will be fewer plan changes in the future, or at least less loss when changes occur? Take the Jixi Erdaogouzi vertical shaft as an example. The plan was reversed four times in less than three months. Surely, it cannot be said that changes were carefully considered?
    Currently, the basic construction plan is undergoing changes. In order to save and concentrate the use of funds, it is absolutely necessary to reduce some secondary projects that can be delayed, compress investment in some projects, and change the original plan. However, when "changing," do not forget to be "cautious," and do not cause avoidable losses due to rashness and subjectivity.
    We hope that planning workers will guard this pass and avoid erroneously changing plans due to subjective reasons as much as possible. This will be a great contribution to the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign.

### 慎“变”

    慎“变”	孔桑
    计划不稳定，变动太多，这是浪费的一大来源。在增产节约运动中，希望编制和决定计划的机关也来挖挖这方面的潜力。
    这方面的潜力有多少？这笔账很难估算。这里只举两个例子，从中可以略见一般。
    鸡西煤矿二道河子竖井从去年4月开始施工。7月11日，接到上级指示，叫立即停工；并且决定把板条房子等半永久性建筑物全部拆掉，各种材料和设备都运回仓库。不料，过了十天，工地正在忙于拆运，上级又发来指示叫复工。复工不久，9月12日又接到指示叫停工。停工二十四天后，又接到了指示叫复工。这样停停开开，仅只运费和拆房子的损失就达五万五千多元。
    第一机械工业部第五设计分局是一个将近千人的大设计机构，四年来做了近二十个初步设计、五个技术设计、三个施工设计。但是，因为计划变更，这些设计中只有两件是“成品”，其余的全报废了。设计力量的浪费不算，仅只这四年中的机关开支就近千万元。
    还有一些需要改建的工厂，就是因为产品方案定不下来，一拖就是好几年，到今天还是老样子。如果早些下决心，现在不但扩建工程早已完成，产品可以缓和目前国家物资供应紧张的局面，就连扩建投资也早已收回了。
    我们国家开始有计划的建设为期不久，很多同志经验不多，还没有摸清经济发展的规律。计划的变更是难以避免的。但是，是不是一切计划的变更都是不可避免的呢？是不是可以总结出一些教训来，使得以后计划可以变得少些，或者至少在变的时候少遭到些损失？就拿鸡西二道河子竖井来说吧，不到三个月的时间，计划反复了四次，这总不能说在变更的时候是慎重考虑了的吧？
    目前基本建设计划正在变动之中。为了节约，为了集中使用资金，削减一些次要的可以缓建的工程，压缩一部分项目的投资，改变原订的计划，是完全必要的。但是，在“变”的时候，千万不要忘记“慎”，不要因为轻率和主观，造成本来可以避免的损失。
    我们希望计划工作者们把住这道关口，尽可能避免因为主观上的原因而错误地变更计划。这将是增产节约运动中一项莫大的贡献。
