    More Education, Fewer Punishments
    Yan Jun
    In the current rural Party rectification work, a small number of rural Party organizations are not starting with ideological education for Party members, but with punishing Party members, and the results of the rectification are very bad.
    This is the case with some rural branches in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province. When studying the Party rectification plan, the Party rectification work group sent to Yong'an Township in this county first considered which Party members to punish during the rectification, and first put forward a list of Party members who should be punished, and then collected materials on the "mistakes" made by these Party members according to the list. The general branch secretary of Tuanshan Township in this county even believed that "if some Party members are not severely punished, they will never raise their awareness." Under the guidance of this wrong thinking, 13 of the 18 Party members in this township were punished. It has recently been found that four of the punishments were too severe, and five should not have been punished at all.
    Did this kind of punishment raise the awareness of the punished Party members? Did it raise the enthusiasm of all Party members? The opposite is true. Both the punished Party members and the unpunished Party members developed a fear of Party rectification. They were thinking about whether they would be punished and how to avoid punishment, so it was impossible for them to seriously examine their thinking and actively improve their work. Therefore, after the Party rectification, the political enthusiasm of the Party members not only did not increase, but even decreased for some, because they learned a very negative lesson from this Party rectification: if you want to work, you will inevitably make mistakes, and if you make mistakes, you will inevitably be punished, so it is better not to work or work less. The fact that many comrades in the Heibei Cooperative Party Branch of Huachuan County were unwilling to take on Party positions after the Party rectification proves this. Due to the incorrect Party rectification methods adopted, the confidence of Party members in leading production in the Wangxing Cooperative in Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, was not strengthened, but reduced, and there was a phenomenon of being timid and not daring to be boldly responsible in their work.
    Some comrades do not understand that ideological education is the fundamental method for our Party to raise the awareness of Party members, and it is also the fundamental method for our Party to overcome shortcomings and mistakes within the Party. Party rectification is a method for the Party to conduct a relatively systematic and concentrated education of Party members. It is to help Party members examine and summarize a period of thought and work, to allow Party members to use the standards of a Communist Party member, to use the methods of criticism and self-criticism to recognize their shortcomings and mistakes, to raise their communist awareness, and to boost the confidence and courage of Party members to strive for the cause of communism. In order to achieve this goal, there is no other way except to start with ideological education. The idea that only punishing a group of Party members can raise the awareness of Party members is a very naive idea and a very bad Party rectification method, because this method itself destroys the most normal and basic relationship between the Party and Party members, that is, the Party's care and trust for Party members. It also violates the principle that the Party believes that the vast majority of Party members are willing to accept the Party's education and are able to correct their shortcomings and mistakes. This puts the Party and Party members in an antagonistic position. Doing so fundamentally violates the principles of the Party.
    It is hoped that the rural Party organizations in various localities, especially the Party committees of counties and the work groups sent by higher-level Party committees to the countryside to help with Party rectification, will conscientiously implement the policy of Party rectification that mainly conducts ideological education of Party members, and overcome and prevent the phenomenon of excessive punishment or even pure punishment.

### 多教育　少处分

    多教育　少处分	岩军
    在目前的农村整党工作中，有一小部分农村党组织，不是从对党员进行思想教育入手，而是从对党员进行处分入手，因而整的结果很坏。
    黑龙江省桦川县的个别农村支部就是这样。这个县派到永安乡的整党工作组，在研究整党计划时，首先考虑到的就是在整党中准备处分哪些党员，并且首先就提出了一个该受处分的党员的名单，然后根据名单去收集这些党员所犯“错误”的材料。这个县的团山乡总支书记甚至认为：“如果不狠狠地处分一些党员，他们绝不能提高觉悟。”就在这种错误思想的指导下，这个乡的十八名党员中即有十三名受了处分。最近查明，其中四名处分过重，还有五名根本不该受处分。
    这样处分的结果是不是提高了被处分党员的觉悟呢？是不是提高了所有党员的积极性呢？事实恰恰相反，不论是被处分的党员或者没有被处分的党员，都对整党产生了一种恐惧的心理，他们心里想的是自己会不会受处分，怎样才能避免处分，因而就不可能认真地检查思想，积极地改进工作。因此，整党以后，党员的政治热情不但没有提高，有的甚至降低了，因为他们从这次整党中得出了一个非常消极的教训：既要作工作，就难免犯错误，而犯了错误，又难免受处分，还是不作工作，少作工作的好。桦川县黑背合作社党支部在整党以后，许多同志不愿再担负党内职务，就是证明。由于采取了不正确的整党方法，黑龙江省集贤县王兴合作社党员领导生产的信心没有加强，反而减低了，在工作中发生了缩手缩脚不敢大胆负责的现象。
    有些同志不懂得进行思想教育的方法，是我们党提高党员觉悟的根本方法，也是我们党克服党内缺点和错误的根本方法，整党正是党对党员进行比较系统的和比较集中的教育的一种方法。是为了帮助党员检查和总结一个时期的思想和工作，让党员运用共产党员的标准，运用批评和自我批评的方法来认识自己的缺点和错误，来提高自己的共产主义觉悟，来鼓起党员为共产主义事业奋斗的信心和勇气。为了达到这个目的，除过从思想教育入手，不可能有其他的办法。那种认为只有处分一批党员才能提高党员的觉悟的想法，是一种非常幼稚的想法，是一种很坏的整党方法，因为这种方法本身就破坏了党和党员之间最正常最起码的关系，即党对党员的关怀体贴和信任。也破坏了党认为绝大部分党员是愿意接受党的教育，能够改正自己的缺点和错误的这一原则。而使党和党员处于一种对立的地位。这样作是从根本上违反了党的原则的。
    希望各地农村党组织，尤其是党的县委会和上级党委派到农村帮助整党的工作组，能够认真贯彻主要对党员进行思想教育的整党的方针，克服和防止过多处分以至单纯处分的现象。
