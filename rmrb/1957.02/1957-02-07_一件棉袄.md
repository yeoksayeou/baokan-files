    A Cotton-padded Coat	Xiao Yingjun

    My wardrobe holds a worn, blue cotton-padded coat. Whenever I recall its origin, my heart cannot remain calm.

    Ten years ago, during a severe winter, Comrade Wang Ru and I were imprisoned together in a Kuomintang concentration camp in Xi'an. It was freezing cold, with water dripping and turning to ice. I was only wearing a lined jacket, and I shivered from the cold all day long. Comrade Wang Ru had a cotton-padded coat sent by his mother, and he insisted that I wear it every day, but I firmly refused each time. This was not only because he was my leader, but also because he was older, and I had a responsibility to protect his health.

    However, an unfortunate event suddenly occurred:

    That evening, he was brought back from interrogation. When he was pushed through the door, he walked with faltering steps, his face full of anger. I went forward to support him, and he turned his head to look at me blankly for a moment, a tear glistening in the corner of his eye, and he tightly grasped my hand, saying, "Comrade, we are going to be separated. Every day you live here, you must fight." I wanted to ask him more about the interrogation, but he just shook his head and did not answer. His eyes stared straight at the night sky outside the iron window, where a few cold stars twinkled.

    A biting cold wind swept in from the iron window. Comrade Wang Ru suddenly stood up, took off the cotton-padded coat, and handed it to me, saying, "Comrade, you wear it! This was sewn stitch by stitch by my elderly mother..." I was about to refuse him as usual, but he suddenly became so stern and said, "Wear it! Can you listen to me this once?" I had no choice but to say, "Then what about you? Aren't you cold?" "No, my heart is very warm," he said, and then he paced to the iron window again, gazing for a long time at the northern sky. Beneath those distant stars, there was his hometown, his mother, and our beloved Party.

    After a long time, he turned back and asked me, "Comrade, what do you think is the most precious thing in the world?"

    "Freedom, happiness," I said without hesitation.

    He took a deep breath and said, "Yes! Freedom, happiness—do you still remember that poem by Petőfi? 'Life is dear, and love is dearer, but both must give way to freedom.'"

    I nodded, and then remained silent.

    In the middle of the night, heavy leather shoes sounded in the corridor. Comrade Wang Ru suddenly walked up to me and embraced me with unusual warmth. "Take care of yourself! Comrade, farewell!" he whispered. I was suddenly stunned, as if in a daze, and a cold tear fell on my cheek.

    The door opened, and several wolf-like, tiger-like beasts pulled him away, never to return.

    Not long after, with the help of underground comrades, I escaped from that hell on earth. For ten years, I have cherished this worn cotton-padded coat. I feel that no gorgeous clothes in the world can compare with it. Even during the intense days of war, I did not throw it away.

    Today, when I look at this cotton-padded coat, I am still so moved. A huge shadow is permanently imprinted on my heart. I saw the conscience of a Communist. This conscience also frequently leads me to self-reflection, to remember the tradition of hard struggle, and not to forget the original fine qualities.

### 一件棉袄

    一件棉袄	萧英俊
    我的衣箱里藏着一件破旧的毛蓝布的棉袄，每当我回忆起它的来历时，心情总是不能平静。
    十年前一个严寒的冬季，我和王如同志同时被囚在西安一个国民党的集中营里。那是滴水成冰的寒天，我身上只穿了一件夹袄，整天冷得浑身哆嗦。王如同志有一件他母亲寄来的棉袄，天天强迫着要我穿上，但我每次都坚决地拒绝了。这不仅因为他是我的领导者，而且因为他年纪大了，我有责任要保护他的身体。
    可是，不幸的事情忽然发生了：
    那天晚上，他被传审回来了。当他被推进门时，走着蹒跚的脚步，满脸怒容。我向前去扶着他，他扭过头来呆呆地看了我一会，眼角噙着一粒泪珠，紧紧地握着我的手说：“同志，我们要分开了。你在这里活一天就要斗争一天。”我想再问他一些传审的情况，他只摇摇头不回答。两只眼直望着铁窗外的夜空，那里闪烁着几颗寒星。
    一阵刺骨的寒风从铁窗中刮进来。王如同志忽然站起来，脱下那件棉袄，递给我说：“同志，你穿上吧！这是我年老的母亲一针一线缝的……。”我正准备和往常一样地拒绝他，可是他忽然变得那样严厉地说：“穿上吧！听我一次话好吗？”我只得说：“那你呢，你不冷吗？”“不，我心里很热。”他说着又踱到铁窗旁边，长久地凝望着北边的天空，在天边那遥远的繁星下面，有他的家乡，他的母亲，和我们亲爱的党。
    过了很久，他回过头来问我：“同志，你说世界上最宝贵的是什么呢？”
    “自由，幸福。”我毫不思索地说。
    他长呼了一口气说：“是啊！自由，幸福——你还记得裴多菲的那首诗吗？‘生命诚可贵，爱情价更高，若为自由故，两者皆可抛’。”
    我点了点头，此后就一直沉默着。
    半夜的时候，走道上响起了沉重的皮鞋声。王如同志突然走到我跟前，异乎寻常地拥抱着我。“自己保重吧！同志，永别了！”他低声地说。我猛一下痴呆了似的，有一滴冰凉的眼泪落在我脸颊上。
    门开了，几个如狼似虎的黄皮野兽，把他拉走了，再也不回来了。
    不久以后，依靠地下同志的帮助，我逃出了那座人间地狱。十年来，我一直珍藏着这件破旧的棉袄，我觉得世界上任何华丽的衣服都不能跟它相比。即使在紧张的战争的日子里，我也没有把它抛掉。
    今天，当我看着这件棉袄的时候，我仍然是那样激动。一个巨大的影子长久地烙印在我的心上，我看到了一个共产党人的良心。这个良心也频频地引我自省，记住艰苦奋斗的传统，不要把原来的优良品质遗忘了。
