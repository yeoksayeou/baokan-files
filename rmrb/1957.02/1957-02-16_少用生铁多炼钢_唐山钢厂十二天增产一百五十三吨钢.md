Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, February 15th: The steelworkers of the state-owned Tangshan Steel Plant increased steel production by 153 tons from February 3rd to 14th. The steel's qualification rate reached 99.72%, exceeding the state quota by 0.72.

This factory has been experiencing a shortage of pig iron supply since January of this year, which has greatly affected the increase in steel production through the open-hearth furnace method. In order to supply the country with more and better steel even with insufficient pig iron supply, the steelworkers put forward the slogan "Use less pig iron, produce more steel." Technicians also went deep into the production teams to help workers research and improve operating techniques, reduce pig iron consumption, and increase the yield and quality of steel ingots. They converted all the old pig iron melting furnaces into top-charged furnaces and expanded the tuyeres, which raised the molten iron temperature to over 1370 degrees Celsius. The temperature of the molten steel also increased accordingly, greatly reducing splashing and sticking. At the same time, the amount of iron oxide scale added per ton of molten steel was increased from a few kilograms in the past to 25 kilograms, and the average pig iron consumption per ton of steel was reduced from 1212 kilograms in January to 1190.59 kilograms. In addition, the steelmaking workshop also summarized the experience of early slag formation and appropriate increase of lime for desulfurization by the steelmaking worker Liu Yuzhu and other groups, which improved the quality of steel ingots.

    少用生铁多炼钢
    唐山钢厂十二天增产一百五十三吨钢
    新华社唐山15日电　国营唐山钢厂炼钢工人从2月3日到14日增产一百五十三吨钢；钢的合格率达到99.72％，比国家定额提高零点七二。
    这个厂从今年1月份就发生了生铁供应不足的现象，使精炉炼钢增产受到很大影响。为了在生铁供应不足的情况下也能供给国家更多更好的钢，炼钢工人提出少用生铁多炼钢的口号；技术人员也深入生产小组帮助工人研究改进操作技术，降低生铁消耗，提高钢锭的产量和质量。他们把所有的旧化铁炉都改装成炉顶布料，并且扩大了风眼，使铁水温度提高到一千三百七十多度，钢水的温度也随着提高，因而使喷溅、粘包等现象大大减少；同时还把每吨钢水的氧化铁皮加入量由过去的几公斤增加到二十五公斤，每吨钢的生铁消耗平均由1月份的一千二百一十二公斤降低到一千一百九十点五九公斤。此外，炼钢车间还总结了炼钢工刘玉柱等小组早化渣、适当增加石灰等去硫的经验，提高了钢锭质量。
