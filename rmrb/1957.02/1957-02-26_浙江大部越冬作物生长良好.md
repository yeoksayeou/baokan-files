Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou -- Of the 23 million mu of winter crops in Zhejiang Province, wheat, barley, and grass seeds (green manure crops) are generally growing better than last year. Rapeseed has also begun to sprout leaves. In Wenzhou and other areas where the season is earlier, rapeseed has already begun to bolt.

Agricultural cooperatives in Zhejiang Province generally pay more attention to field management of winter crops this year. Barley, wheat, and grass seeds have generally been fertilized once or more, and the second fertilization of rapeseed fields has generally been completed, with many areas carrying out a third fertilization. Recently, after a period of rain and snow in Zhejiang Province, most winter crops have been ditched and drained.

    浙江大部越冬作物生长良好
    据新华社杭州电　浙江省二千三百万亩越冬作物中的小麦、大麦、草子（绿肥作物）普遍长得比去年好。油菜也已发叶。季节较早的温州一带，油菜已经开始抽苔。
    浙江省各地农业社今年普遍重视越冬作物的田间管理工作。大麦、小麦和草子已经普遍施肥一次以上，油菜田的第二次施肥一般已经结束，不少地区正进行第三次施肥。最近，在浙江省一度雨雪以后，大部分越冬作物又进行了开沟排水的工作。
