As Close as Brothers
Liu Bang

Comrade Kang Jianwu, from the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau's working group stationed at the Yumen Oil Mine, had a stack of telegrams from the Qaidam Basin on his desk. I casually flipped through them, and the content was as follows:

	Urgently allocate five tons of ferrous sulfate from Yumen Oil Mine.

	Manggai’s gasoline and diesel reserves are low, send them quickly.

	Manggai. Oxygen is urgently needed, please ship it quickly,
	and telegraph the shipping date. ......

Comrade Kang Jianwu said to me: "Since the start of petroleum exploration in the Qaidam Basin, we have often taken these 'urgent telegrams' to various relevant departments of the Yumen Oil Mine, requesting support. As a result, we obtained drill pipes, drill bits, and mud shakers from the Drilling Company; gates and joints from the Refinery; and oxygen and other items from the Material Supply Department. In 1956, we transported more than a thousand tons of various materials and sixteen thousand tons of various fuels from the Yumen Oil Mine. One of the main reasons why the first exploration well in the Qaidam Basin—the Youquanzi exploration well—was able to start drilling on time was because of the generous assistance from the Yumen Oil Mine. At that time, our bureau had just been established and was like a baby just leaving the womb, possessing nothing beyond itself; at that time, the drill pipes came from Yumen, the derricks came from Yumen, and the water tanks also came from Yumen. Regarding supporting Qaidam, the relevant staff of Yumen Oil Mine often said: 'Whatever we have, we can give you.' In fact, they gave us things they didn't even have..."

I couldn't quite understand his last sentence for a moment. Another member of the working group, Comrade Chang Shengxiang, then told me the following two things:

At the end of the year before last, the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau sent the working group a list of materials, listing more than sixty kinds of equipment. These items were not available at the Yumen Oil Mine. To immediately order and process them, there were neither drawings nor actual samples. How difficult! In the end, they had to bite the bullet and ask the Production Technology Department of the Yumen Oil Mine for help. The Production Technology Department immediately approved it to the Machinery Plant. Under the circumstances of tight work and material shortages, the Machinery Plant managed to squeeze out time each month to manufacture this equipment for Qaidam. Engineers at the Machinery Plant collected information from all sources and designed this special order. Last year, between March and April, one heavy truck after another finally left Yumen City on time and headed towards Qaidam. The trucks were loaded with ball mills, mud pools, and derrick bolts, and also filled with the deep friendship of the Yumen Oil Mine workers for their brothers fighting on the shores of Lake Gas.

At the end of last October, the working group received another urgent telegram: a shortage of more than 76,500 refractory bricks was hindering the installation of boilers and other insulation equipment in Da Qaidam, and they were asked to find a way to raise them at the Yumen Oil Mine. Before this, the working group had already transported 150,000 refractory bricks from the Yumen Construction Company's brick factory. Now it was a bit difficult to ask for more. Moreover, the "tight" situation of the Yumen Oil Mine in terms of refractory brick supply was obvious to all. The brick factory itself had several kilns waiting for bricks; and of the hundreds of thousands of bricks ordered by the Oilfield Construction Engineering Company, only more than 30,000 had been produced at that time. However, thinking of the scene of thousands of comrades shivering in the snowy Qaidam Basin, they had no choice but to take this "urgent telegram" to discuss with the relevant departments. As a result, with the support of the mine bureau leaders, 30,000 refractory bricks, which had been ordered by the Yumen Oilfield Construction Engineering Company, inspected, and temporarily stored in the brick factory, were first transferred to the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau; and it was also agreed that the remaining 46,500 bricks would be given in two installments after they were produced. When loading the trucks, the director of the brick factory led the cadres of the factory to help load the trucks, which ensured that this batch of urgently needed materials was transported to Qaidam as soon as possible, so that there was also a warm winter under the Kunlun Mountains.

After listening to this moving account, I decided to visit the Machinery Plant. When I talked to the workers about why they so enthusiastically supported Qaidam, an old worker pulled out two oil-stained "Petroleum Workers' News" from the drawer, spread them out in front of me, and said, "Look for yourself!"

The first newspaper published an article by Costel Moisă, the chief engineer of the Romanian drilling team supporting China:

	Drilling has begun. This is one of the most complex industrial operations, especially as it
	requires close coordination. For example, if a lathe worker encounters a material
	supply problem during production, he can wait a while and then make up for the
	delayed time by working harder. Naturally, a lack of material supply is harmful to any kind of
	production. But it is especially serious for the drilling team. For example, when the well wall
	needs to be reinforced, the lack of necessary materials will cause the drill bit to be stuck by the collapsed
	rock, and sometimes even more serious technical accidents will occur. To prevent
	this from happening, the solution of supply problems must be given priority.
	...

The second newspaper published a speech by Wang Zaitian, the head of the First Branch of the Central Delegation, at a meeting to comfort the workers of the Yumen Oil Mine. The full text is very long, but the workers underlined the following sentences:

	Our country does not have many petroleum industry talents, and the Yumen Oil Mine, which has a long history, must
	unquestionably take on the task of supporting brother oil mines. ...

It turned out that it was these words that moved the hearts of the Yumen Oil Mine workers; it was these words that were constantly stimulating the workers' enthusiasm for supporting Qaidam! Although there are sometimes uncoordinated aspects in the work collaboration between these two units, judging from the above situation, they have established a friendship as close as brothers.

    亲如兄弟
    柳梆
    青海石油勘探局驻玉门油矿工作组亢建武同志的办公桌上，放着一叠来自柴达木盆地的电报，我随手翻阅了一下，内容是这样的：
    速在玉门油矿调拨绿矾五吨。
    汽油和柴油茫崖存数不多，速运。
    茫崖。氧气待用至急，希速发运，
    并电告运出日期。…………
    亢建武同志对我说：自从柴达木盆地进行石油勘探以来，我们就经常拿着这类“急电”去找玉门油矿的各个有关部门，请求支援。于是，我们从钻井公司得到了钻杆、钻头和泥浆筛，从炼油厂得到了闸门和接头，从器材供应处得到了氧气和其他的东西。1956年，我们先后从玉门油矿运走各种器材一千多吨，各种油料一万六千吨。柴达木盆地的第一口探井——油泉子探井能够及时开钻的主要原因之一，就是因为得到玉门油矿的慷慨援助。那时候，我们局成立不久，就像一个刚离开母腹的娃儿一样，一身之外别无长物；那时候，钻杆是玉门来的，井架是玉门来的，水罐也是玉门来的。对于支援柴达木，玉门油矿的有关工作人员常常这样说：“凡是我们有的，都可以给你们。”实际上，他们没有的也给了我们………。
    对于他后面的这句话，我一时还不能理解。工作组的另一个成员——常盛祥同志接着就告诉了我下面的两件事：
    前年年底，青海石油勘探局给这个工作组寄来一张要器材的单子，上面开列了六十几种器材。这些东西都是玉门油矿所没有的。马上订制和加工吧，既没有图纸，也没有实样。好为难哪！最后他们还是硬着头皮去请玉门油矿生产技术处帮忙。生产技术处立刻批到机械厂。机械厂在工作紧张和材料缺的情况下，每月硬是挤出时间来为柴达木制造这些设备。机械厂的工程师从各方面为这批特殊的订货收集资料，进行设计。去年三、四月间，一辆接着一辆的载重汽车，终于按时开出玉门市，驶往柴达木。汽车上面，装满了球磨机、泥浆池和井架螺丝，也装满了玉门油矿职工对于战斗在尕斯湖畔的兄弟的深厚情谊。
    去年10月末，工作组又接到一封告急的电报：大柴旦安装锅炉和其他的保温设备，尚缺耐火砖七万六千五百多块，要他们在玉门油矿设法筹措。在这以前，工作组已经从玉门建筑公司制砖厂运走了十五万块耐火砖。现在再向人家伸手，实在有点难以启口。再说，玉门油矿在耐火砖供应上的“捉襟见肘”的情形，是有目共睹的。制砖厂自己就有几座窑在等着砖用；油田建设工程公司订制的几十万块砖，当时也只生产了三万多块。但是，一想到千百个伙伴瑟缩在漫天风雪的柴达木盆地的情景，他们又不得不把这封“急电”拿去同有关部门商量。结果在矿务局领导人员的支持下，把玉门油田建设工程公司订制的、已经验收过、暂时寄存在制砖厂的三万块耐火砖，先行调给青海石油勘探局；其余的四万六千五百块，也说好等生产出来以后分两期给。在装车的时候，制砖厂的厂长带领着厂里的干部一齐动手帮助装车，这样就保证了这批急如星火的材料早日运往柴达木，使得昆仑山下也有了一个温暖的冬天。
    听完了这番动人的叙述，我决定到机械厂去访问。当我同工人们谈起他们为什么这样热情地支援柴达木的时候，一位老师傅从抽屉里翻出来两张沾满油污的“石油工人报”，把它摊开在我的面前，说：“你自家瞧吧！”
    头一张报纸上刊载着罗马尼亚支援中国钻井队主任工程师柯斯代尔·莫伊赛写的文章：
        钻井开始了。这是最复杂的工业操作之一，尤其是它要
    求工作密切衔接。比方说，一个车床工人在生产中遇到材料
    供应不上时，他可以等一会儿再干，然后只要加一把劲就可
    以把耽误的时间弥补起来。自然，材料供应不上对任何一种
    生产都是有害的。但是对钻井队来说尤其严重。例如在井壁
    需要加固时，缺少了必要的材料，那么钻头就会被塌下来的
    岩石卡住，有时甚至还会发生更严重的技术事故。为了防止
    这种情况的发生，必须把解决供应问题，放在优先的地位。
    ……
    第二张报纸上登的是中央代表团第一分团团长王再天在慰问玉门油矿职工大会上的讲话。全文很长，但是工人们在下面这些句子旁边划上了红杠：
        我国石油工业人材不多，有了多年历史的玉门油矿就要
    义不容辞地担负起支援兄弟油矿的任务。……
    原来正是这些话，把玉门油矿职工们的心弦拨动了；正是这些话，在不断地激发着职工们支援柴达木的热情！尽管在这两个单位的工作配合中有时还存在着不够协调的地方，但从上述情况看来，他们已经建立了亲如兄弟的友谊。
