Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 14th: The "Indonesia Torch" newspaper reported today that President Sukarno said on the 13th that one of the contents of his upcoming plan is to organize a broadly composed committee. The people participating in this committee will include representatives from all levels, such as workers, farmers, youth, women, chiefs of staff of the three armed forces, police, some cabinet members, and representatives from various regions of Indonesia.

The President said that this committee will assist the government in carrying out its tasks, especially in construction. After the establishment of the committee, the parliament does not need to be "frozen" or dissolved, and the government will still be accountable to the parliament as usual.

On the 13th, President Sukarno received a delegation from the Jakarta anti-subversion mass rally and explained to them the content of his reform plan. The delegation submitted to President Sukarno the resolution of the rally and a public letter from the rally expressing support for his reform plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 13th: The Indonesian Parliament concluded this morning the debate on the government's statement regarding the Sumatran incident. Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo made his second response to the parliament.

The parliament did not vote on the status of the current government regarding the Sumatran incident because no member of parliament raised a motion of no confidence in the government's policies.

In his reply, the Prime Minister said that the government still believes that its policies and measures are correct. The government has not found any parliamentarians putting forward other principled ways to replace the government's policy of resolving the Sumatran incident.

He said, "The government still adheres to the position it expressed in the statement on January 21st and the reply on February 4th."

He also said that unless the parliament has different opinions, the government will continue to implement its policies and measures to resolve the Sumatran issue quickly and correctly, while carrying out a comprehensive reorganization to improve and strengthen the cabinet organization.

He said that the government believes that the "Banteng Division Committee's" unauthorized granting of autonomous province status to Jambi is unconstitutional.

In response to a question from a member of parliament, the Prime Minister said that what happened in Sumatra was more of a conspiracy than a coup. The government is taking preventive measures in the military field.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 14th: Hadi, chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party's parliamentary group, said in today's "Indonesia Torch" regarding the conclusion of the parliament's debate on the government's statement on the 13th, that the opposition led by the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party was unable to introduce a vote of no confidence in the parliament, indicating that the government has gained the trust of the parliament to continue working. Hadi hoped that all government parties would sincerely help the government in its reorganization work.

Sakirman, chairman of the Communist Party's parliamentary group, said that the parliament's debate proved that the opposition could not politically point out any errors in the government's policies.

Today's "Social Messenger" believes that after the parliament's debate, the government parties should concentrate all their efforts on solving the current problems.

The "People's Daily" said that the result of the parliament's debate shows that the United States has miscalculated again, and the prediction of the "New York Times" has failed. This American newspaper once predicted that the Indonesian cabinet would collapse within a week. The "People's Daily" believes that efforts must be made to thwart the reactionary's future conspiracies to overthrow the cabinet.

    苏加诺说明革新方案的内容
    国会结束对苏门答腊事件的辩论　反对派未能提出不信任政府案
    新华社雅加达14日电　今天的“印度尼西亚火炬报”报道，苏加诺总统在13日说，他的即将公布的方案内容之一是要组织一个成分广泛的委员会。参加这个委员会的人将包括一切阶层的代表，如工人、农民、青年、妇女、三军参谋长、警察、一些内阁阁员和印度尼西亚各地区的代表。
    总统说，这个委员会将从旁协助政府执行任务，特别是建设方面的任务。委员会成立以后，国会不必“冻结”或解散，将来政府还是照常向国会负责。
    苏加诺总统在13日接见了雅加达反颠覆活动群众大会的代表团，向他们说明了他的革新方案的内容。代表团向苏加诺总统提交了大会的决议和大会表示支持他的革新方案的公开信。
    据新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚国会今天上午结束了对政府关于苏门答腊事件的声明所进行的辩论。沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理对国会作了第二次答辩。
    国会没有就苏门答腊事件对现政府的地位问题进行投票，因为没有任何议员对政府的政策提出不信任案。
    总理在答辩中说，政府仍然相信它的政策和措施是正确的。政府并未发现有任何议员提出其他原则性的办法来代替政府解决苏门答腊事件的政策。
    他说，“政府仍然坚持它在1月21日的声明和2月4日的答辩中所表明的立场”。
    他还说，除非国会有不同的意见，政府在进行全面改组以改善和加强内阁组织的同时，还将继续执行它的政策措施以便迅速而正确地解决苏门答腊问题。
    他说，政府认为，“雄牛师委员会”擅自给予占碑以自治省的地位是违反宪法的。
    总理在回答一位议员的询问时说，在苏门答腊发生的事情，与其说是政变，倒不如说是阴谋。政府正在军事方面采取预防措施。
    新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚国民党国会党团主席哈迪今天在“印度尼西亚火炬报”上就13日国会结束对政府声明的辩论发表谈话说，马斯友美党和社会党两党领导的反对派没有能力在国会中提出不信任案，表明政府得到了国会的信任而继续工作下去。哈迪希望所有政府党诚意地帮助政府进行改组工作。
    共产党国会党团主席萨基尔曼说，国会的辩论证明反对派不能从政治上指出政府的政策有错误。
    今天的“社会使者报”认为国会辩论结束后，政府党应当集中全力去解决当前的问题。
    “人民日报”说，国会辩论结果说明美国又一次失算了，“纽约时报”的预言落空了。这家美国报纸曾经预测印度尼西亚内阁将在一周内倒台。“人民日报”认为，必须努力挫败反动派今后继续倒阁的阴谋。
