Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: According to TASS, Bulgarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gerasimov, held a reception on the 18th for the Bulgarian government delegation headed by Yugov, which was visiting the Soviet Union.
    Soviet Party and government leaders Bulganin, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Molotov, Pervukhin, Suslov, Khrushchev, and others, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries, were invited to attend the reception.
    At this sincere and friendly reception, Yugov, Bulganin, and others delivered speeches.
    In his speech, Yugov emphasized the friendship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. He said that there exists a relationship of complete mutual trust between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. This is a sincere relationship based on comradely cooperation and mutual assistance, free from any selfishness or prejudice. It is precisely because of this sincere fraternal friendship that Bulgaria has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country, established its own industry in a short historical period, achieved the socialist transformation of agriculture, equipped agriculture with new technologies, and improved the material and cultural welfare of the working people.
    Yugov then spoke about further consolidating the unity of socialist countries and uniting more closely all forces that cherish the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. He said that our strength lies in unity, and unity can frustrate all actions of the enemies of peace and socialism.
    In his speech, Bulganin said that the peoples of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria have a long tradition of friendly relations, fraternal friendship, and mutual assistance. The current friendship between the two peoples is based on the unity of socialist interests of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, and on the unwavering implementation of the Marxist-Leninist principles of complete equality of rights of large and small countries, respect for national independence, and broad cooperation in economic, political, and cultural life. The fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria will continue to develop and consolidate in the future, benefiting the peoples of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria and the peoples of other peace-loving countries.

    在保加利亚驻苏联大使举行的招待会上
    两国领导人强调巩固保苏兄弟友谊
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社报道：保加利亚驻苏联大使格拉西莫夫18日为以于哥夫为首的保加利亚政府代表团访问苏联举行了招待会。
    苏联党和政府的领导人布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫等和各国外交使节应邀出席了招待会。
    在这个诚恳友好的招待会上，于哥夫、布尔加宁等先后讲了话。
    于哥夫在讲话中强调了保苏两国的友谊。他说，保苏之间存在着彼此完全信任的关系。这是一种真诚的、没有任何自私和偏见的以同志合作和互助为基础的关系。正是由于这种诚挚的兄弟友谊，保加利亚由落后的农业国变成了工业农业国，在一个短短的历史时期内建立了自己的工业，实现了农业的社会主义改造，为农业装备了新技术，提高了劳动人民的物质文化福利。
    于哥夫接着谈到要进一步巩固社会主义国家的团结，更加紧密地团结一切珍视和平、民主和社会主义事业的力量。他说，我们的力量在于团结，团结可以使和平和社会主义的敌人的一切行动落空。
    布尔加宁在讲话中说，苏保两国人民有着悠久的友好关系、兄弟情谊和互助的传统。两国人民现在的友谊是基于苏联和保加利亚社会主义利益的一致，基于始终不渝地贯彻大小国家权利完全平等、尊重民族独立，以及在经济、政治、文化生活各方面实行广泛合作的马克思列宁主义原则。苏保两国人民的兄弟友谊今后将不断发展、巩固，为苏保两国人民和其他爱好和平国家的人民造福。
