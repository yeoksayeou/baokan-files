Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd News: TASS Moscow reported that "Pravda" published an editorial on February 2nd on the statement of the talks between the Soviet Communist Party and the Czechoslovak Communist Party delegations, saying that this statement is new evidence of the strengthening of brotherly ties between communist and workers' parties. This connection united all the forces of the socialist camp.

The editorial pointed out that the principle of proletarian internationalism is the unshakable foundation of the life and activities of revolutionary Marxist parties. The statement of the talks between the Soviet and Czech Communist Party delegations proves that the two parties firmly uphold the principle of proletarian internationalism and hold high its great banner. Between the Soviet and Czech Communist Parties, unbreakable fraternal relations have been laid on the basis of complete equality and mutual respect, and full mutual understanding has been established. This is of great benefit to the common cause of building socialism and developing the international workers' movement. The Soviet Communists warmly support the determination expressed by the two parties in the negotiations to continue to develop the brotherly ties between the two parties in the future.

The editorial said that in recent times, the communist and workers' parties of the socialist camp have strengthened their mutual contacts. Representatives of some fraternal parties held talks. All these talks show the determination of the Communist Party to carry out a joint struggle against imperialist provocations, and against various anti-socialist activities of opportunists and traitors in the workers' movement. The Communist Party resolutely struggles against all phenomena that waver and deviate from the principles of proletarian internationalism, against taking nationalist and revisionist positions, and against the recently spread ideas of so-called "national communism." Consistently protecting and strengthening the position of proletarian internationalism is the most reliable way to strengthen the unity of socialist countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 2nd: The Czechoslovak "Red Right" published an editorial on January 31st on the results of the talks between the Soviet and Czech delegations in Moscow, saying that the sincere and friendly relations between the Soviet and Czech peoples were felt by the Czechoslovak delegation and all Czechoslovak people who visited the Soviet Union. However, some people, especially some in the West, find it difficult to understand this brotherly friendship and sincere unity between the Soviet and Czech peoples, because they do not understand that the friendship between socialist countries is based on complete consensus of interests, full equality and selfless assistance.

The editorial then emphasized that the Czechoslovak and Soviet delegations affirmed in the joint declaration that their views on disarmament, the German question, and the prevention of German militarist aggression were in complete agreement, which is particularly important to all the Czech people, because the Czech people do not want history to repeat itself.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Czechoslovak people had watched the progress of the Moscow talks with great interest and confidence, because they knew that whenever talks were held between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, it always meant that the working people of Czechoslovakia would receive benefits, assistance and security guarantees.

    苏“真理报”和捷“红色权利报”
    欢迎苏捷会谈的重要成果
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在2月2日就苏联共产党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团会谈声明发表社论说，这个会谈声明是共产党和工人党之间的兄弟联系加强的新证据。这种联系把社会主义阵营的一切力量团结了起来。
    社论指出，无产阶级国际主义的原则，是革命的马克思主义政党的生活和活动的不可动摇的基础。苏共和捷共代表团会谈声明证明，两党坚决维护无产阶级国际主义的原则，高举着它的伟大旗帜。苏共和捷共之间，在完全平等和相互尊重的原则基础上，奠定了牢不可破的兄弟关系，建立了充分的相互谅解。这对建设社会主义和发展国际工人运动的共同事业有很大好处。苏联共产党人热烈支持两党在谈判中所表示的今后要继续发展两党间的兄弟联系的决心。
    社论说，最近时期，社会主义阵营各国的共产党和工人党加强了相互间的接触。一些兄弟党的代表举行了会谈。所有这些会谈都表明共产党有决心来进行共同的斗争，反对帝国主义挑衅，反对工人运动中的机会主义者和叛徒的种种反社会主义活动。共产党坚决斗争，反对一切对无产阶级国际主义原则有所动摇和背离的现象，反对采取民族主义和修正主义的立场，反对最近散播的所谓“民族共产主义”的思想。贯彻始终地保护和加强无产阶级国际主义立场，是加强社会主义国家团结的最可靠的道路。
    新华社布拉格2日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”1月31日就苏、捷两国代表团在莫斯科会谈的结果发表社论说，苏捷两国人民间真挚、友好的关系是捷克斯洛伐克代表团和一切访问苏联的捷克斯洛伐克人都感受到的。但是，有人，特别是西方有一些人难于理解捷苏两国人民中的这种兄弟情谊和真诚团结，因为他们不懂得社会主义国家间的友谊是建立在利益的完全一致、充分平等和无私援助的基础上的。
    社论接着强调指出，捷苏两国代表团在联合宣言中肯定它们对裁军问题、德国问题和防止德国军国主义侵犯的问题看法的完全一致，这对全捷人民特别重要，因为捷克斯洛伐克人民不希望历史再次重演。
    社论最后说，捷克斯洛伐克人民曾经怀着极大的兴趣和信心注视莫斯科会谈的进程，因为他们知道，每当捷、苏两国间举行会谈的时候，这总是意味着捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民将得到好处、援助和安全的保障。
