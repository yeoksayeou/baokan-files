Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 9th. The Shandong Provincial Bureau of Culture and the cultural organs of Qufu County are assisting the Ministry of Culture in organizing and restoring the almost lost ancient music and dance of the Confucius Temple in Qufu.

The ancient music (i.e., Dacheng music) and ancient dance of the Confucius Temple in Qufu were performed by ancient emperors and descendants of Confucius during annual ceremonies to worship Confucius, consisting of three parts: music, dance, and rituals. Some musical instruments and songs and dances are almost lost locally. The proposal to restore the ancient music and dance of the Confucius Temple was put forward by Wu Xiaobang, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, during his inspection in Qufu County last November. In early January of this year, the Ministry of Culture sent cadres to Qufu to form a "Confucius Temple Music and Dance Committee" with responsible persons from local relevant organs to study the music and dance of the Confucius Temple, and invited and assembled elderly people who had participated in the sacrificial ceremonies and people who had participated in the "Ancient Music Training Center" to jointly train dancers. The organization work is expected to be completed by the end of March; preparations are also being made to film the ancient music and dance of the Confucius Temple as archival material.

    文化部整理孔庙古乐古舞
    新华社济南9日电　山东省文化局和曲阜县的文化机关正在协助文化部整理恢复几乎失传的曲阜孔庙的古乐古舞。
    曲阜孔庙的古乐（即大成乐）古舞，是古代皇帝和孔子的后代在每年祭祀孔子的仪式上演奏的，共有乐、舞、礼三个部分。有的乐器和歌舞在当地几将失传。恢复孔庙古乐古舞的倡议，是政协全国委员会委员吴晓邦去年11月到曲阜县视察工作时提出的。今年1月上旬，文化部派出干部到曲阜同当地有关机关负责人组成“孔庙乐舞委员会”，研究孔庙乐舞，并且邀请、调集当地参加过祭祀仪式的老人和参加过“古乐传习所”的人员，共同训练舞蹈人员。这次的整理工作，预计将在3月底结束；还准备把孔庙的古乐古舞拍成影片，作为资料保存。
