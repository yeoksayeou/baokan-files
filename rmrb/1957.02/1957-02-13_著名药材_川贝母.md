    Famous Medicinal Material - Sichuan Fritillaria
    Wang Zixin
    Sichuan Fritillaria is a famous medicinal material, with high yield and good quality.  Dajianlu, Xiaojin, and Songpan in Sichuan Province are the main producing areas of fritillaria.  Every time the fritillaria production season arrives, men, women, and children go to the mountains to dig fritillaria. This is one of the main sideline productions of local farmers.

    Fritillaria is the main raw material for Chinese medicine preparations, and it is also one of the commonly used medicinal materials in winter. It is a good medicine for resolving phlegm and relieving coughs, and it has the effect of clearing heat and moistening the lungs. In Western medicine, fritillaria is also used to make "cough syrup" and "fritillaria cough pastilles." Fritillaria belongs to the perennial herbaceous plant of the lily family. The stem is about two or three feet high, the leaves are alternate, the upper leaf tips are curled, it blooms pale yellow and green flowers in summer, and it bears fruit in autumn. The underground scaly rhizome is enlarged, composed of two to three thick and fleshy scales, like garlic.

    Pharmaceuticals use the underground bulb of fritillaria, usually dug in June and July, because at this time the cells of the underground bulb store a lot of juice, and the content of active ingredients is also the highest.

    Sichuan Fritillaria not only has a broad sales market in the domestic market, but also enjoys a high reputation in the international market. In recent years, fritillaria has been in short supply in domestic and foreign markets. In order to develop farmers' sideline production and meet market needs, state-owned pharmaceutical companies have reasonably adjusted the purchase price during the fritillaria production season and sent people to the fritillaria producing areas to guide farmers' production. As a result, the output of fritillaria has increased year by year, more than doubling in 1956 compared to 1951.

    著名药材——川贝母
    王子新
    四川贝母，是一种著名的药材，产量多、质量好。四川省打箭炉、小金、松潘等地，是贝母主要产地。每到贝母生产时期，男女老幼都到山上挖掘贝母。这是当地农民主要的副业生产之一。
    贝母是中药制剂的主要原料，也是冬季常用药材之一，为化痰、止咳良剂，有清火、润肺的效用。在西药中，也用贝母制成“止咳糖浆”“贝母流青膏”等。贝母属百合科多年生草本植物，茎高约二、三尺，叶互生，上叶尖端卷曲，在夏季开淡黄、绿色花朵，到秋季结成果实。地下鳞状根茎肥大，由二至三片肥厚多肉鳞片状组成，像大蒜。
    制药是用贝母的地下鳞茎，通常在六、七月间挖掘，因为这时候地下鳞茎细胞中贮藏的汁液很多，有效成分的含量也最多。
    四川贝母不仅在国内市场上有广阔的销路，在国际市场上，也享有很高的声誉。近几年来，贝母在国内外市场上已有供不应求的趋势。国营药材公司为了发展农民副业生产，满足市场需要，曾在贝母生产季节，合理地调整了收购价格，并派人到贝母产地指导农民生产。贝母的产量因此逐年提高，1956年比1951年提高了一倍多。
