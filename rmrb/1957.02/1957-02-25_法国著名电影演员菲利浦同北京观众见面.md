Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: The famous French film actor Philippe and his wife met with the audience in Beijing tonight. He was warmly applauded and cheered by more than a thousand people.

This world-renowned film actor once served as the announcer for the first performance of the Chinese Art Troupe in Paris. This enthusiasm of his was reciprocated in Beijing tonight. When Philippe and his wife arrived at the Capital Cinema, hundreds of audience members who had been waiting for a long time had already gathered inside and outside the cinema. People applauded them, scrambling to ask Philippe for autographs. He was almost not walking, but being pushed to the stage by the "sea of people."

Philippe humorously told the Chinese audience that he was willing to be an ambassador between the Chinese and French film industries. He told the Chinese audience that you have seen many French films, and the French Film Week has been a great success in China. Many French audiences have also seen the Chinese film "The White Haired Girl," and they think it is one of the best films they have ever seen. French film audiences all hope that French and Chinese film circles will strengthen their ties, and sincerely hope that Chinese films can also achieve the same success in France.

After the meeting, the French film "Les Aventures de Till L'Espiègle" starring Philippe was screened.

    法国著名电影演员菲利浦同北京观众见面
    据新华社24日讯　法国著名电影演员菲利浦和他的夫人今天晚上在北京同观众会面。他受到一千多人的热烈鼓掌和欢呼。
    这位世界知名的电影演员曾经充当过中国艺术团在巴黎第一场演出的报幕人。他的这种热情今晚在北京得到了回答。当菲利浦和他的夫人到达首都电影院的时候，电影院的门外门内已经拥集着好几百守候已久的观众。人们向他俩鼓掌，争抢着请菲利浦签名。他几乎不是走，而是被“人浪”涌到台上去的。
    菲利浦幽默地对中国观众说，他愿意作中国和法国电影界之间的大使。他对中国观众说，你们已经看过不少法国电影，法国电影周在中国获得很大的成功。法国不少观众也曾看过中国影片“白毛女”，他们认为这是他们看过的最好的影片之一。法国电影观众都希望法、中电影界加强联系，衷心地希望中国影片在法国也能获得同样的成功。
    见面会后，放映了由菲利浦主演的法国影片“勇士的奇遇”。
