    A Work Group from a Yunnan Border Defense Unit Helps the Masses Build Cooperatives and Develop Production

    (Our report) A certain unit of the Yunnan Border Defense Army has extracted forty-one outstanding officers and soldiers (including seven ethnic groups) to form eleven ethnic work groups. They have been dispatched to remote, high-altitude mountainous areas along the border to assist local governments in carrying out ethnic work centered on strengthening ethnic unity, developing production, and defending the border. Under the unified leadership of local Party committees, the work groups helped the people of Han, Miao, Nong, Tu, Yi, Yao, and other ethnic groups establish a total of forty-one elementary agricultural production cooperatives. Among them, six have been merged into three advanced cooperatives, with a total of 1,882 peasant households joining the cooperatives. After helping the people of all ethnic groups get organized, the work groups further assisted the cooperatives in production and management, educated cooperative members to process land and increase fertilizer application, and introduced them to advanced production experiences and farming techniques, basically ensuring increased production within the cooperatives. For example, with the assistance of Comrade Yang Zhongfu from the work group, the Huadiping Production Cooperative in Malipo County accumulated more than 100,000 jin of fertilizer and adopted the method of close planting with double maize plants, which increased the income of the cooperative's twenty-five peasant households from more than 50,000 jin last year to more than 70,000 jin.

    In order to meet the people's ever-growing cultural needs, this unit has successively opened twenty cultural night schools for fraternal ethnic groups near its station, with a total enrollment of 1,020 people. Three school buildings were built by the unit. These night schools have trained four accountants, seventy-eight scorekeepers, and twelve propagandists for fraternal ethnic groups. The unit also assisted local health departments in treating diseases for the fraternal ethnic groups. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,100 people were treated. As a result of medical treatment and publicity, the health knowledge of the fraternal ethnic groups has been greatly improved. (Li Bohua)

    云南边防军某部派出工作组
    协助群众建社发展生产
    本报讯　云南边防军某部抽调了优秀的军官和士兵四十一人（包括七个民族），组成了十一个民族工作组，分赴边沿高寒山区，协助地方政府展开了以加强民族团结、发展生产、保卫边防为中心的民族工作。工作组在地方党委的统一领导下，共帮助汉、苗、侬、土、彝、瑶等各族人民建立了四十一个初级农业生产合作社，其中有六个已并为三个高级社，入社农民共一千八百八十二户。在帮助各族人民组织起来以后，工作组又帮助合作社进行生产、经营管理，教育社员实行土地加工、增施肥料，向他们介绍先进生产经验和先进耕作技术，基本上保证了社内增产。如麻栗坡县花地坪生产合作社，在工作组杨忠福同志的帮助下，积了十万多斤肥料，采用了包谷双株密植的方法，使该社二十五户农民的收入，由去年的五万多斤提高到七万多斤。
    为了满足群众不断增长的文化要求，这支部队先后为驻地附近兄弟民族开办了二十个文化夜校，入学的共有一千零二十人。有三个校舍，都是部队给盖起来的。这些夜校，给兄弟民族培养了会计四人、记分员七十八人、宣传员十二人。部队还协助地方卫生部门，替兄弟民族人民治疗疾病。据不完全统计，给群众治疗二千一百多人次。通过治病和宣传的结果，大大地提高了兄弟民族的卫生常识。　	（李伯华）
