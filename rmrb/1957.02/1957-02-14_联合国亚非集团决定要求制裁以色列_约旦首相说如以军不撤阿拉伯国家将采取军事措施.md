Xinhua News Agency, February 13th, New York: The chairman of the United Nations Afro-Asian Group, Jordanian representative Rifai, told reporters on the evening of the 12th that because Israel refuses to implement the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the complete withdrawal of troops from Egypt, the twenty-seven Afro-Asian countries have decided to submit a proposal demanding sanctions against Israel. This proposal will be submitted before the General Assembly discusses the Middle East issue again. The General Assembly's discussion on this issue will be held soon.

Xinhua News Agency, February 13th, Amman: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi told reporters on the 12th that Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq have agreed to "take military measures" against Israel if Israel refuses to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and Sharm el-Sheikh.

He said that the Arab countries agreed to do so at the Beirut conference in November last year. That conference was held shortly after Israel and the United Kingdom and France invaded Egypt.

He said: "The United Kingdom and France should be held responsible for Israel's actions of contempt for the United Nations resolution (demanding Israel's withdrawal)."

    联合国亚非集团决定要求制裁以色列
    约旦首相说如以军不撤阿拉伯国家将采取军事措施
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国亚非集团主席约旦代表里法伊12日晚上对记者说，由于以色列拒绝执行联合国大会关于从埃及全部撤军的决议，二十七个亚非国家已经决定提出一项要求对以色列实行制裁的提案。这个提案将在大会再次讨论中东问题以前提出。大会关于这个问题的讨论将在不久举行。
    新华社13日讯　安曼消息：约旦首相纳布西12日对记者说，约旦、黎巴嫩、埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯和伊拉克已经同意对以色列“采取军事措施”，如果以色列拒绝撤出加沙地带和沙姆沙伊赫的话。
    他说，阿拉伯国家在去年11月的贝鲁特会议上同意这样做。那次会议是在以色列和英法两国侵入埃及以后不久举行的。
    他说：“英法两国应该对以色列藐视联合国（要求以色列撤军的）决议的行动负责。”
