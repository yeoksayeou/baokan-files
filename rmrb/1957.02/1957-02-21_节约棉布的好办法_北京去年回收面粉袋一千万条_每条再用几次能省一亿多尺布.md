    Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- Recycling flour sacks has become a regular task for the Beijing grain supply departments. From last year to now, over ten million flour sacks have been recycled. The number of recycled sacks has increased monthly, from over 300,000 sacks at the beginning to 840,000 or 850,000 sacks recently.
    Now, collective mess halls of government agencies, enterprises, and schools, as well as food and beverage, brewing, pastry, and other industries, mostly consciously abide by the "sack-for-sack" system when purchasing flour. According to statistics, the flour sacks recycled from these units alone account for 60% of the total number of flour sacks released in the city. A person in charge of the Municipal Grain Management Department told reporters that the recycled batch of flour sacks is equivalent to approximately 24 million feet of cotton cloth. If each flour sack is disinfected, washed, and continues to be used four or five times, it can save the country over 100 million feet of cotton cloth.
    Currently, the Municipal Grain Management Department is actively studying measures to gradually promote this method among citizens as well.

    节约棉布的好办法
    北京去年回收面粉袋一千万条
    每条再用几次能省一亿多尺布
    新华社20日讯　回收面粉袋已成为北京市粮食供应部门一项经常工作。从去年到现在，回收的面粉袋在一千万条以上。回收的数量逐月上升，从开始每个月收三十多万条增加到最近每月收八十四、五万条。
    现在各机关、企业、学校的集体伙食单位和饮食、酿造、糕点等行业在购买面粉时，大都自觉地遵守“以袋换袋”制度。据统计，光从这一部分单位回收的面袋，就占全市面袋投放总数的60％。市粮食管理部门负责人对记者说，回收的这批面袋，约折合棉布二千四百万尺，如果每条面袋经过消毒洗濯，继续使用四、五次，就能为国家节省一亿多尺棉布。
    目前，市粮食管理部门正在积极研究措施，准备在市民中也逐步推行这种办法。
