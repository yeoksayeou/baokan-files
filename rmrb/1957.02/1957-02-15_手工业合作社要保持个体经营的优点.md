Handicraft Cooperatives Should Maintain the Advantages of Individual Operation
Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives

China's handicraft products are characterized by their smallness, exquisiteness, and variety. In particular, the famous handicrafts and various household goods, both domestically and internationally, possess distinct national characteristics and local styles. They play a significant role in meeting the production and living needs of the people and enriching their cultural lives.

In recent years, China's handicraft production has greatly developed, especially after the launch of the cooperative movement, where achievements have been even more remarkable. However, there are also many problems that urgently need to be solved in the course of the handicraft transformation.

Maintaining Diverse Organizational Forms

Handicrafts include manufacturing and repair service industries, which are flexible in operation, adapt to seasonal market changes, and meet the needs of the broad masses of people. In particular, many service industry craftsmen provide door-to-door service by wandering through streets and alleys, which is very convenient for residents. For example, there is a cobbler in Beijing named Zou Zhilin who has been in business for more than 30 years. He knows the situation of nearby residents very well, even the size, width, and preferences of each person's feet. Therefore, the shoes made by Zou Zhilin are very pleasing to his customers. In the handicraft cooperative movement, it is necessary to maintain the original advantages, adopt diverse organizational forms, and fully promote the production enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of members. However, after the high tide of handicraft cooperativization in the spring of 1956, some staff members of handicraft cooperatives had insufficient understanding of this point, and there was a tendency to blindly pursue large scale, centralized production, and unified calculation of profits and losses. As a result, the original production enthusiasm of the craftsmen was constrained, resulting in reduced variety, decreased quality, chaotic production coordination, increased non-production personnel, high expenses, high costs, and reduced income for members.

At present, the development of most production cooperatives in China is normal and healthy. A part of the decentralized production cooperatives and a part of the supply and marketing production cooperatives, production groups, especially repair service production cooperatives are all decentralized operations, and their retail departments and service points mostly implement group accounting, each calculating its own profits and losses. As for those mobile industries, such as mending pots and sawing bowls, sharpening knives and scissors, repairing shoes, and welding tin kettles, they can only pay the membership fee and not the share capital, continue to maintain the mobile service mode, and strive to improve service attitude and quality. During the high tide of cooperativization, some blindly centralized production and unified operation cooperatives have been adjusted and reorganized in many places, and have achieved good results. For example, after the reorganization of the large cooperatives in Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou and other places, a new and prosperous atmosphere has emerged. After the reorganization of large companies in Tianjin, the machine repair company immediately restored the repair of machines for factories and enterprises; the hardware company immediately resumed production of iron flower buttons and hairpins that were always loved by rural women; the horseshoeing team restored the flexible working hours system and door-to-door service model; the output value increased by more than double before the reorganization; met social needs and increased members' incomes.

Properly Arranging Auxiliary Labor

The "Lianjiapu" (family workshop) is an important business model for individual handicrafts. They take each household as a production unit and are good at widely using auxiliary labor. Most areas have maintained this characteristic after cooperativization. However, some areas did not have enough understanding of the benefits of "Lianjiapu", and there was a blind concentration of production, without paying attention to the reasonable arrangement of auxiliary labor, resulting in a situation where members said "It is good for one person to join the cooperative, but the whole family has difficulty making a living." In order to solve this difficulty, in addition to allowing families with large burdens and the elderly and infirm to operate independently as supply and marketing households in terms of organizational form, family members who originally participated in labor and have certain skills should be absorbed into the cooperative as much as possible. For other auxiliary labor, adopt measures such as "processing outside the cooperative", "selling products for the cooperative on commission", and "organizing sideline production" to arrange production, ensure life, and strive to achieve each person's ability and each person's place. For example, in 1956, more than 80% of the auxiliary labor force in Xiangtan Prefecture, Hunan Province, was arranged. Some counties also established family committees to organize groups for raising poultry, washing clothes, and growing vegetables to engage in sideline production. This not only meets market needs, but also increases the income of the members' families. Members said: Arranging family auxiliary labor is much better than increasing individual wages.

Handicraft workers have always had the habit of long working hours in the peak season and short working hours in the off-season, "supporting the off-season with the peak season." Some areas blindly implemented the "factory-oriented" and "standardized" working hour system, resulting in a situation where, on the one hand, the market supply was in short supply, and on the other hand, the income of members was reduced. At present, many places have corrected this tendency to mechanically stipulate working hours, and allow members to extend working hours in the peak season on the principle of voluntary and not affecting health. For example, last winter, many areas had difficulty in making cotton clothes. Sewing cooperatives in Beijing, Shenyang, Tianjin, Chongqing, Zhangjiakou and other cities adopted measures such as arranging family members to produce and appropriately extending working hours, which changed the tense situation of "no place to sew winter clothes in October" and increased the income of members.

Local Materials, Direct Production and Sales

China's handicraft workers are good at using local raw materials, especially using waste products and substitutes, to manufacture high-quality and inexpensive products. Handicraft workers use a variety of business methods such as catching up with markets, temple fairs, setting up stalls, and setting up stores to sell locally and deliver goods to their homes. Handicraft cooperatives should use local raw materials, waste products, waste materials and substitutes as an important direction for obtaining raw materials for production. Handicraft cooperatives use their own stores to purchase waste products and waste materials, send people to the countryside to purchase or exchange old materials for new products, or sign cooperation contracts with large factories to supply scraps and production parts and components. By adopting these methods, a broad source of raw materials can be opened up. According to typical materials from Huixian County, Henan Province, and Shunyi County, Hebei Province, the use of local raw materials, waste products and waste materials by handicraft cooperative organizations accounts for 60%-70% of the total value of handicraft raw materials. In 1956, handicraft cooperatives across the country purchased and utilized 350,000 tons of waste steel from urban and rural residents. A large number of substitutes were also used, saving raw materials and increasing social wealth.

In terms of product sales, by setting up stores or joint stores, the original production and sales relationships should be restored and developed as much as possible. In addition to the state-owned commercial companies selecting and selling them, contracts should also be signed with supply and marketing cooperatives, industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, schools, troops and agricultural cooperatives to promote products. For example, Dongxiaoshi in Beijing was an important market for the combination of production and sales between individual handicraftsmen and small vendors. After the high tide of cooperativization, production and sales were separated, and Dongxiaoshi was once deserted. After the Beijing Municipal People's Committee discovered this situation, it immediately instructed relevant departments to quickly restore the original business model of Dongxiaoshi, and retained the market's original various operating habits that were convenient for customers. Since then, small vendors and farmers have been very satisfied. Since the opening of the free market under the leadership of the state, handicraft products are sold, selected, sold on commission, or sold by handicraft cooperatives themselves by state-owned and cooperative commercial departments; handicraft associations and professional associations in many large and medium-sized cities have also gradually delegated import and export business to grass-roots associations for independent operation. This is beneficial to reducing operating links, facilitating market supply, increasing public accumulation, and improving members' material and cultural life.

Democratic Management, Thrifty Management

Individual handicraftsmen in the old society lived in poverty and often toiled all year round without getting enough to eat; therefore, they paid special attention to careful calculation, and even bamboo heads and wood scraps had to be used. This is the main condition for them to survive and not be eliminated. After being organized from individuals to collectives and receiving socialist education, this enthusiasm for individual operation and the attitude of masters are still important factors for consolidating and developing handicraft cooperatives. After cooperativization, most handicraft cooperatives can pay attention to relying on members and preserve the fine tradition of thrifty operation, so that cooperatives have gradually developed and grown. Like the Shanghai No. 1 Iron Bed Cooperative, which started with "three hammers", and the Beijing No. 1 Food Cooperative, which started with "a broken washbasin", they have now developed into large-scale mechanized production cooperative factories by relying on members and operating thriftily. The Tianjin No. 2 Wire Reeling Head Cooperative still maintains the production form of "Lianjiapu" after being organized. There is not a single full-time cadre in the entire cooperative. They are thrifty and united and help each other. Since the high tide of cooperativization, output has increased by 30%-50%, while the average burden of various expenses for each member is only 0.56 yuan, and the wages of members have generally increased by about 40%. The raw material for the Beijing Hairpin Cooperative is the tinplate edge of the canning factory; it plans to sell the remaining scraps to the shoe eyelet cooperative to make shoe eyelets and thumbtacks. There are 250 cooperatives in Beijing like this that use most or all waste products, accounting for a quarter of the total number of cooperatives in the city. There are more than 140 cooperatives in Tianjin that use waste products and waste materials for production, creating wealth worth 50 million yuan for the society every year.

However, there are still many cooperatives that are not good at management, have huge organizations, have many non-production personnel, have chaotic finances, and even have corruption and waste. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen socialist education, promote democracy, advocate thrifty management, so that members are concerned about the development of the cooperative, improve management, and establish production and financial systems. These are necessary conditions for consolidating and developing cooperatives.

Preserve Advantages, Proceed Step by Step

Individual handicrafts do have certain advantages in production and operation, but there are also some backward things. Handicrafts are small and scattered, and production is affected by the season. "Starving to death in the off-season and busy to death in the peak season", and shoddy production during peak season and using inferior products to top good ones are all shortcomings of handicrafts, which must be gradually transformed through the road of cooperativization. Overcome the difficulties of small capital and short legs through various organizational forms, unified supply and marketing or self-production and self-sales, unified use of funds or support from bank loans. Arrange production and overcome seasonal difficulties by state-owned and cooperative commercial departments processing in the off-season, or giving play to collective strength, making reserves in the off-season; or adjusting labor within the cooperative organization. Some cotton weavers only have a hand-pulled small wooden machine or a foot-operated iron-wood machine. Blacksmiths and red stove households only have a few hammers and pliers. The production tools of the bamboo and wood industry and cloth shoe industry are even simpler. In 1955, the average annual output value per individual handicraft worker in the country was only 900 yuan. In 1956, the average output value per member of the production cooperative was 2,300 yuan. Members with semi-mechanization and mechanization reached more than 6,000 yuan. This fully demonstrates the superiority of being organized. However, because China's machinery manufacturing industry is not yet developed enough, the accumulation of funds in the handicraft industry itself is slow, and the cultural and technical level is low; therefore, the implementation of technical transformation must adopt a step-by-step approach. We should make full use of the existing technical foundation, continuously improve it, and gradually improve it. We should criticize those ideas and practices that are too ambitious regardless of specific conditions. For example, the small hardware cooperative in Xiamen City, Fujian Province, uses molds to produce iron shovels instead of manual operation, which increases efficiency by 20 times. A bamboo weaving cooperative in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, made its own "foot-operated bamboo splitting machine" to replace manual bamboo splitting, which can split 1,800 pieces per hour, increasing production efficiency by 21 times. It can be seen that improving tools and increasing production efficiency is an important content of the current labor competition in the handicraft industry. In addition, we also encourage handicraft cooperatives to make full use of waste machinery, expand capital accumulation, and, where possible, build factories, train technical personnel, and arrange surplus labor in a planned manner, using modern scientific and technological equipment to implement semi-mechanized and mechanized production.

In short, the superiority of China's handicraft organization is very significant. However, there are also many shortcomings. The central task in 1957 is to further improve production, strengthen socialist education, advocate thrifty management, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The grass-roots cooperatives in various places should, under the leadership of the local party and government, rely on the socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of members to make further development in the cause of handicraft cooperativization in China.

    手工业合作社要保持个体经营的优点
    中华全国手工业合作总社筹备委员会副主任　邓洁
    我国的手工业产品，具有小巧玲珑、产品多样的特点。特别是驰名国内外的工艺美术品和各种生活用品的名牌货，更具有民族特点和地方风格。对于满足群众生产生活需要，丰富人民的文化生活起着重大的作用。
    这几年来，我国的手工业生产有了很大的发展，尤其是在开展合作化运动以后，成绩更为显著。但是，手工业改造在前进的道路上，同样有许多急待解决的问题。
    保持多种多样的组织形式
    手工业有制造性行业和修理服务性行业，经营灵活，适应市场季节变化，供应广大人民需要。尤其是许多服务性行业的手工业者游街串巷上门服务，对居民来说非常方便。如北京市有个名叫邹致林的鞋匠，开业三十多年，他对附近居民的情况，连那一家那一个人脚的尺码大小肥瘦和爱好那种式样都很清楚，因而邹致林做出的鞋很合主顾的心意。在手工业合作化运动中，保留原来的优点，采取多种多样的组织形式，充分发扬广大社员的生产积极性和创造性是十分必要的。然而，在1956年春季手工业合作化高潮以后，有些手工业合作社人员对这一点却认识不足，出现了贪高图大，盲目集中生产、统一计算盈亏的偏向；结果束缚了手工业者原有的生产积极性，造成品种减少、质量下降。生产协作混乱；非生产人员增多，开支大，成本高，社员收入降低等不良后果。
    目前，我国大部分生产合作社的发展是正常的、健康的。有一部分分散生产的合作社和一部分供销生产社、生产小组、特别是修理服务性的生产合作社都是分散经营的，它们的门市部和服务点大多数实行分组核算，各计盈亏。至于那些流动性的行业，如补锅锯碗、铲刀磨剪、修鞋、焊洋铁壶等行业，他们可以只缴入社费，不缴股金，继续保持流动服务方式，并且努力改善服务态度、提高服务质量。合作化高潮的时候某些盲目集中生产、统一经营的合作社，许多地方已经进行调整改组，收到了良好效果。如天津、石家庄、郑州等地的手工业合作社，进行分社改组以后，都出现了欣欣向荣的新气象。天津市的大社改组后，机器修配社立即恢复为工厂企业修理机器；五金社立即恢复生产一向受农村妇女喜爱的铁花扣和发卡；马掌小组恢复了灵活的工时制度和串店服务方式；产值都比改组前提高了一倍多；满足了社会需要，增加了社员收入。
    妥善安排辅助劳动
    “连家铺”是个体手工业重要的经营方式。他们以一家一户为生产单位，善于广泛利用辅助劳动力。合作化后大多数地区保持了这一特点。但是有一些地区对“连家铺”的好处没有足够的认识，曾经发生盲目集中生产，不注意合理安排辅助劳动，以致造成社员“一人入社好，全家生活难”的情况。为了解决这个困难，除了在组织形式上让家庭牵累大的和年老体弱的作为供销户独立经营外，对原先参加劳动和有一定技术的家属，都应尽量设法吸收入社。对其他辅助劳动力，采取“社外加工”、“为合作社代销产品”、“组织副业生产”等办法安排生产，保障生活，努力做到各尽所能、各得其所。如湖南省湘潭专区1956年有80％以上的辅助劳动力得到了安排。有的县还成立家属委员会，组织养家禽、洗衣、种菜小组，从事副业生产。这样做既满足了市场需要，又增加了社员全家收入。社员说：安排家庭辅助劳动力，比增加个人工资强得多。
    手工业者向来有旺季工时长，淡季工时短，“以旺养淡”的习惯。有些地区盲目实行“工厂化”“正规化”的工时制度，以致造成一方面市场供不应求，另方面社员收入减少。目前，许多地方已经纠正了这种机械规定工时的偏向，允许社员在自愿和不影响健康的原则下，旺季可以延长工时。例如去年冬季不少地区棉衣制作困难，北京、沈阳、天津、重庆、张家口等市的缝纫合作社采取安排家属生产和适当延长工时等办法，改变了“十月寒衣无处缝”的紧张局面，又增加了社员的收入。
    就地取材，自产自销
    我国手工业者善于利用地方原料，特别是利用废品废料和代用品，制造物美价廉的产品。手工业者利用赶集、赶庙会、摆摊子、设门市等等多种多样的经营方式，就地销售，送货上门。手工业合作社应该利用地方原料、废品、废料和代用品作为取得原料进行生产的重要方向。手工业合作社利用自己的门市部收购废品废料，派人下乡收购或以新产品换回旧料，或跟大工厂订立供应下脚料和生产部件、另件的协作合同，采用这些办法，可以开辟广阔的原料来源。据河南省辉县和河北省顺义县的典型材料，手工业合作组织利用地方原料、废品废料的占手工业原料总值的60％—70％。1956年全国手工业合作社收购和利用了城乡居民的废钢铁达三十五万吨。还大量地利用各种代用品，节约了原料，增加了社会财富。
    在产品销售上，通过设立门市部或联合门市部，尽量恢复和发展原有的产销关系，除由国营商业公司选购包销外，并且跟供销社、工矿企业、机关、学校、部队和农业合作社签订合同推销产品。如北京市的东晓市，原来是个体手工业者同小商贩产销结合的重要市场。合作化高潮后，产销脱节，东晓市曾经一度门庭冷落。北京市人民委员会发现这一情况后，当即指示有关部门，迅速恢复东晓市原有的经营方式，并保留了市场原有的便利顾主的各种经营习惯。此后小商贩和农民非常满意。自从国家领导下的自由市场开放后，手工业产品由国营和合作社营商业部门包销、选购、代销或由手工业合作社自销；许多大中城市的手工业联社和专业联社也将进销业务逐步下放由基层社自行经营。这对减少经营环节，便利市场供应，增加公共积累，改进社员物质和文化生活都是有利的。
    民主办社，勤俭办社
    旧社会个体手工业者生活贫困，往往终年劳动，不得一饱；因此，他们特别注意精打细算，竹头木屑，都要设法利用。这是他们能够生存不被淘汰的主要条件。从个体到集体组织起来并得到社会主义教育以后，这种个体经营的积极性和主人翁的态度，仍然是巩固和发展手工业合作社的重要因素。合作化以后，大部分手工业合作社都能注意依靠社员，保存勤俭经营的优良传统，使合作社日渐发展壮大。像“三把鎯头”起家的上海第一铁床社，“一个破面盆”起家的北京第一食品社，由于依靠社员，勤俭办社，今天都发展成为大型的机械化生产合作工厂。天津市第二线制马笼头合作社组织起来后，仍然保持“连家铺”的生产形式，全社没有一个脱产干部，他们勤俭节约，团结互助。合作化高潮以来，产量提高30％—50％，而每个社员各项费用的平均负担才0.56元，社员工资普遍增加40％左右。北京市发卡合作社的原料是罐头厂的马口铁边；它准备把剩下的下脚料卖给鞋眼合作社制作鞋眼和图钉。北京市像这样大部或全部利用废品废料的合作社有二百五十个，占全市总社数的四分之一。天津市有利用废品废料生产的合作社一百四十多个，每年为社会创造的财富达五千万元。
    但是还有不少合作社，不善于经营管理，机构庞大，非生产人员多，财务混乱，甚至发生贪污浪费现象。今后必须加强社会主义教育、发扬民主、提倡勤俭办社，使社员都关心合作社事业的发展，改善经营管理，建立生产和财务制度，这些都是巩固和发展合作社的必要条件。
    保存优点，循序渐进
    个体手工业在生产上、经营上固然有某些优点，但是也有一些落后的东西。手工业小而分散，加上生产受季节影响，“淡季饿死、旺季忙死”，旺季脱销粗制滥造，以次顶好，都是手工业的缺点，必须通过合作化道路逐步加以改造。通过各种组织形式，统一供销或自产自销，统一使用资金或由银行贷款扶持等办法克服本小腿短的困难。通过国营和合作社营商业部门在淡季加工，或发挥集体力量，作淡季储备；或在合作组织内部调剂劳动力等办法安排生产、克服季节性的困难。有些棉织户只有一架手拉小木机或脚踏铁木机。铁匠红炉户只有几把锤子、钳子。竹木业和布鞋业生产工具就更简单了。1955年全国个体手工业每人平均年产值只有九百元。1956年生产合作社社员的每人平均产值为二千三百元。半机械化和机械化的社员达到六千元以上。这就充分显示了组织起来的优越性。但是，由于我国的机器制造业还不够发达，手工业本身资金积累慢；文化技术水平低；因此，实行技术改造就必须采取循序渐进的方针。应该充分利用现有的技术基础，不断改进，逐步提高。应该批判那些不顾具体条件好高骛远的想法和做法。例如：福建省厦门市的小五金社，利用印模生产铁铲子，代替手工操作，即提高效率二十倍。江西省永新县一个竹篾社，自制了一架“脚踏破篾机”代替手工破篾，每小时可破一千八百根，提高生产效率二十一倍。可见改进工具，提高生产效率是当前手工业劳动竞赛中的重要内容。此外，我们也鼓励手工业合作社尽量利用废旧机器，扩大资金积累，在可能条件下，兴建厂房，培养技术力量，有计划地安排剩余劳动力，利用近代化的科学技术设备，实行半机械化和机械化生产。
    总之，我国手工业组织起来的优越性是很显著的。但是，缺点也是很多的。1957年的中心任务，是进一步地把生产搞好，加强社会主义教育，提倡勤俭办社，开展增产节约运动。各地基层社应该在当地党和政府的领导下，依靠广大社员的社会主义积极性，使我国手工业合作化事业获得进一步的发展。
