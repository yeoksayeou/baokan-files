Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: According to TASS reports, Khrushchev delivered a speech on the 18th at a reception held by the Bulgarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union for the Bulgarian government delegation's visit to the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said: The Soviet people established friendly relations with the Bulgarian people long ago. There is no issue that can divide the Soviet and Bulgarian people, and no issue that can prevent the two Communist Parties from uniting in the struggle for the victory of communism. This is a great guarantee for continuing to strengthen the genuine friendly relations between the Soviet and Bulgarian peoples and the two Communist Parties.

Khrushchev then spoke about the recent talks between the Soviet Union and delegations from some socialist countries. He added: The common struggle for the cause of socialism, for peace, and for the security of all nations unites us. The bourgeois governments have no sympathy for our socialist countries. Capitalists spend tens of millions of dollars on espionage and subversive activities against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. They spend hundreds of billions of dollars on armaments and on establishing military bases on foreign territories. We have seen through all the enemies' conspiracies, and we have taken the necessary measures to avoid being caught off guard by the enemy's surprise attacks. We do not want to fight, and we are not prepared to invade anyone. But if someone comes to invade us, then we will defend ourselves. However, when we rise up to defend ourselves, those who invade others will find it difficult to cope.

Referring to the Hungarian events that occurred not long ago, Khrushchev said: The Hungarian people are strong. The people of all fraternal countries came to help the Hungarian working people. We have said, and we will say now, that we will never disregard our friends in distress, either in the past or in the future. We will always defend the interests of socialist countries, and if necessary, we will step forward ourselves to save our friends from disaster.

Next, Khrushchev emphasized the fraternal friendship and unity of socialist countries. He said: The unity of our people and the struggle to safeguard the purity of Marxist-Leninist doctrine are the foundation of foundations, and we should fight for this foundation. Those who attempt to undermine the unity of socialist countries should be crushed with three times the strength in one blow.

Finally, Khrushchev talked about the issue of Stalin. He said: Our Party condemned the errors and distortions related to the cult of personality of Stalin. It was a powerful party that made this condemnation automatically; no one forced us to do so. We criticized these errors out of principled considerations and out of a desire to move more quickly along the road of building communism. Our people understand, approve, and support the Leninist policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The errors and shortcomings of Stalin that our Party criticized were also resolutely criticized by Lenin long ago. These errors and shortcomings became particularly evident in Stalin's later years.

However, Stalin, with whom we worked, was an outstanding revolutionary. The Party advanced along the road of Lenin, defeated the enemies of socialism, united all the people of our country, and built a strong socialist country.

In the arduous struggle to smash Hitlerite fascism, the Soviet people defended the great achievements of the socialist revolution and saved the people of Eastern European countries from the threat of fascist enslavement. This great victory was achieved under the leadership of our Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Stalin. Stalin was loyal to the interests of the working class and the cause of Marxism-Leninism, therefore we will never call Stalin an enemy.

    赫鲁晓夫在保加利亚大使招待会上说
    苏联永远要保卫社会主义各国的利益
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社报道：赫鲁晓夫18日在保加利亚驻苏联大使为保加利亚政府代表访问苏联举行的招待会上发表了讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫说：苏联人民很早就同保加利亚人民建立了友好关系。没有任何问题足以使苏保两国人民不和好，没有任何问题足以使两国共产党在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中不团结。这是继续加强苏保两国人民和两国共产党真正友好关系的很大的保障。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了苏联最近和一些社会主义国家代表团的会谈。他又说：争取社会主义事业、争取和平和各国人民安全的共同斗争把我们团结在一起。资产阶级政府对我们社会主义国家没有同情，资本家们用几千万美元进行反对苏联和其他社会主义国家的间谍颠覆活动。他们把几百亿美元花在军备上，用于在异国领土上建立军事基地。我们识破了敌人的一切阴谋诡计，我们采取了必要的措施，以免我们受敌人的突然袭击而手足无措。我们不愿意打仗，我们不准备去侵犯谁。但是如果有人来侵犯我们，那么我们将要自卫。不过当我们起来自卫的时候，侵犯别人的人就将难于招架了。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到不久前发生的匈牙利事件的时候说：匈牙利人民是坚强的。各个兄弟国家的人民都来援助匈牙利劳动人民。我们曾经说过，并且现在还要说，我们无论过去和将来都永远不会置朋友于苦难之中而不顾。我们永远要保卫社会主义各国的利益，如果需要，我们要自己挺身出来把我们的朋友从灾难中救出来。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫着重谈到了社会主义国家的兄弟友谊和团结。他说：我们人民的团结和为维护马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁而进行的斗争是基础的基础，我们应该为这一基础奋斗。对那些企图破坏社会主义国家团结的人，应当一下子用三倍力量的打击把他们打垮。
    赫鲁晓夫最后谈到了有关斯大林的问题。他说：我们党谴责了与对斯大林个人崇拜有关的错误和歪曲。它是一个强大的党自动作出这种谴责的；没有人强迫我们这样作。我们批判这些错误是出自原则上的考虑，是本着更迅速地沿着建设共产主义的道路前进的愿望。我国人民了解、赞同和支持苏联共产党中央委员会的列宁主义政策。我们党批评斯大林的那些错误和缺点也是列宁早就坚决批评过的。这些错误和缺点在斯大林晚年表现得特别明显。
    但是，和我们共事的斯大林是一位杰出的革命家。党沿着列宁的道路前进，打垮了社会主义的敌人，团结我国全体人民、建成了一个强大的社会主义国家。
    苏联人民在粉碎希特勒法西斯主义的艰苦斗争中保卫了伟大的社会主义革命成果，从法西斯奴役的威胁下拯救了东欧各国人民。这一伟大的胜利是在我们党和以斯大林同志为首的党中央委员会的领导下取得的。斯大林矢忠于工人阶级的利益、马克思列宁主义事业，因此我们决不会把斯大林说成是敌人。
