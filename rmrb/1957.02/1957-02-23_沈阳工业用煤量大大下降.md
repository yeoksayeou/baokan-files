Shenyang, February 22nd (By our correspondent) - A campaign to conserve coal is underway in factories and enterprises throughout Shenyang.

　　Workers at the Shenyang Public-Private Joint Venture Zhaoxin Ceramics Factory improved kiln eye and firing techniques and adopted quantitative, temperature-controlled, and timed methods, converting their entire block coal plan, originally requiring over 3,900 tons, to raw coal. Consumption has also significantly decreased. It is estimated that over 1,200 tons of raw coal can be saved annually. The quality of the fired products has also improved, with the first-class product rate increasing by more than 10%. Consequently, coal costs have decreased by 14%. Their improvements have attracted the attention of relevant departments. The Municipal Second Industry Bureau and the Municipal Daily-Use Metal, Glass, and Porcelain Industry Company convened relevant units to introduce their experiences. The Third Workshop of the Shenyang Enamel Factory first implemented Shanghai's furnace building experience in one firing furnace. Burning raw coal completely achieved the temperature of block coal, and consumption was reduced. Previously, it required 2,400 jin of block coal per hour; after the improvement, only 2,100 jin of raw coal were needed. This factory has proposed implementing this method in all firing furnaces throughout the factory without requiring state investment. The Public-Private Joint Venture Dongyuan Dyeing Factory used lower-grade coal to replace high-grade coal and utilized waste heat from flues and waste heat warm water, saving an estimated 1,100 tons of good coal annually. The large kiln in the firing workshop of the Municipal Acid-Resistant Materials Factory, which previously used only block coal, also changed its old ways this year, mixing in 80% raw coal. Boiler workers at the Shenyang Textile Factory, Chemical Factory, and Leather and Clothing Factory have all researched ways to save coal. Boiler workers at the Shenyang Textile Factory actively improved operations, saving 154 tons of coal in January compared to the plan. The Second Workshop of the Shenyang Steel Rolling Plant improved its coal-burning methods, saving 429 tons of coal in January. Boiler workers at the Shenyang Third Rice Mill successfully researched using rice husks mixed with coal to fire boilers, saving a large amount of raw coal. They all believe that this year, the coal miners have given up their holidays to produce "grain" for us, and we should not waste it at all!

    沈阳工业用煤量大大下降
    本报讯　节约用煤工作已经在沈阳市各个工厂企业展开。
    沈阳公私合营肇新陶瓷厂职工，改进窑眼和烧窑技术，并采取定量、定温、定时的方法，把原需三千九百多吨的块煤计划全部改为原煤，消耗量还大大下降，预计全年能省原煤一千二百多吨。烧窑质量也有所提高，现在一等品率比过去提高10％以上，煤的成本也因此降低14％。他们的改进已引起有关部门重视。市第二工业局、市日用金属玻璃瓷器工业公司曾召集有关单位介绍了他们的经验。沈阳搪瓷厂三车间先在一个烧成炉推行上海砌炉的经验，烧原煤完全达到块煤的温度，损耗也降低了，过去每小时要二千四百斤块煤，改进后只用二千一百多斤原煤。这个工厂已提出，不用国家投资，在全厂所有烧成炉推行这个方法。公私合营东源染厂用次煤顶好煤和利用烟道余热、余热温水等办法，初步统计，全年可节约好煤一千一百多吨。市耐酸材料厂烧成车间大窑过去全用块煤，今年也改变了老规矩，掺用80％的原煤。沈阳纺织厂、化学厂、皮革装具厂锅炉工人都研究过节约煤的办法。沈阳纺织厂司炉工人积极改进操作，1月份就比计划节约了一百五十四吨煤。沈阳轧钢厂二车间改进烧煤办法，1月份节约四百二十九吨煤。沈阳第三制米厂锅炉工研究用稻皮掺煤烧锅炉成功，可节省大量原煤。他们都认为今年煤矿工人放弃了假日为我们生产“粮食”，我们一点也不该浪费啊！
