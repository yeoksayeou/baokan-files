Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 21st. The first session of the new Polish Parliament opened at 4:00 PM on February 20th in the Parliament Hall. During the session that day, the Speaker, Deputy Speakers, and the new Council of State headed by Zawadzki were elected. At the session, Cyrankiewicz was re-elected and continued to serve as Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

    The parliamentary session that day was unprecedentedly grand. The surroundings of the Parliament Hall presented a festive scene. At the top of the milky-white circular hall, the red and white Polish flags were hung. More than half an hour before the meeting began, the press box and the audience were packed. Originally, there were only seven hundred seats in the auditorium, but more than ten thousand people requested to attend.

    Before the meeting began, members of parliament from the Polish United Workers' Party, the United People's Party, the Democratic Party, the Catholic Church, and non-party members were seated in order from left to right. At exactly four o'clock, the oldest member of parliament, 74-year-old Droobner, announced the opening of the meeting. In his brief opening remarks, he said: The results of the Polish election are a sign of the people's support for socialism, which greatly disappointed those abroad who hoped the election would weaken the socialist camp. Although the parties in parliament have different worldviews, patriotism, moving towards socialism, and the desire to unite with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries bind us together.

    After Droobner's speech, he led all members of parliament in taking the oath.

    Then, Member of Parliament Podedworny nominated Wicech (United People's Party) as a candidate for Speaker on behalf of the parties.

    The meeting unanimously elected Wicech as Speaker. At this time, Wicech took office amidst warm applause.

    Subsequently, the meeting unanimously elected Kliszko of the United Workers' Party and Jodłowski of the Democratic Party as Deputy Speakers.

    Deputy Speaker Jodłowski then nominated Zawadzki (United Workers' Party) as Chairman of the Council of State, Albrecht (United Workers' Party), Kulczyński (Democratic Party), Lange (United Workers' Party) and Podedworny (United People's Party) as Vice-Chairmen, Horodiński (United People's Party) as Secretary, Banach (United People's Party), Hain (Democratic Party), Gomulka, Kruczkowski, Loga-Sowiński, Musiałowa, Nowak (the above five are from the United Workers' Party), Ożga-Michalski (United People's Party) and Zawieyski (Catholic) as nine members. These nominations were unanimously or overwhelmingly passed in the vote.

    After a fifteen-minute break, the meeting elected the Credentials Committee and the Parliamentary Rules Drafting Committee.

    Then Speaker Wicech read a letter from the current Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz. The letter stated that in accordance with the constitution, the government had resigned to the new parliament.

    The meeting accepted the resignation of the government and immediately elected the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

    At this time, Gomulka rose to speak. He said that, according to the consultations of the parties, he was entrusted to nominate Cyrankiewicz as a candidate for Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Gomulka said that we unanimously believe that Cyrankiewicz has performed the duties of Chairman of the Council of Ministers very well, and we believe that under his leadership, the government will be able to fully realize the program of the National Unity Front.

    Gomulka's speech won warm applause from the audience. In the vote, Cyrankiewicz was elected with the support of the vast majority of members.

    The meeting adjourned here and decided to reconvene on the 26th. During the adjournment, the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, will form a government.

    波兰新议会第一次会议开幕
    萨瓦茨基和西伦凯维兹分别重新当选为国务委员会主席和部长会议主席
    新华社华沙21日电　波兰新议会的第一次会议2月20日下午四时在议会大厅开幕。在这一天会议上，选出了议长、副议长、以萨瓦茨基为首的新的国务委员会。会上，西伦凯维兹重新当选，连任部长会议主席。
    这一天，议会会议盛况空前。议会大厅四周呈现出一片节日景象。在乳白色的圆形大厅的顶端，悬着红白两色的波兰国旗。还在开会以前半个多小时，记者席和旁听席上就挤满了人。原来旁听席上只有七百个座位，但是要求旁听的人却在一万以上。
    会议开始以前，波兰统一工人党、统一农民党、民主党、天主教会和无党派的议员们从左至右按顺序就座。四时整，年纪最大的议员——七十四岁的德罗布纳宣布会议开幕。他在简短的开幕词中说：波兰大选的结果是人民拥护社会主义的表示，这使国外那些希望大选会削弱社会主义阵营的人大失所望。议会中各党派虽然世界观不同，但是爱国主义、向社会主义前进和同苏联及一切社会主义国家友好团结等愿望把我们结合在一起。
    德罗布纳致词后，又领导全体议员宣誓。
    接着，议员波戴德沃尔尼代表各党派提名维策赫（统一农民党）为议长候选人。
    会议一致选举维策赫为议长。这时维策赫在热烈掌声中就职。
    随后，会议又一致选举统一工人党的克利什科和民主党的约德洛夫斯基为副议长。
    副议长约德洛夫斯基接着代表各党派提名萨瓦茨基（统一工人党）为国务委员会主席，阿尔布列赫特（统一工人党）、库耳钦斯基（民主党）、兰格（统一工人党）和波戴德沃尔尼（统一农民党）为副主席，霍罗丁斯基（统一农民党）为秘书，巴纳赫（统一农民党）、哈因（民主党）、哥穆尔卡、克鲁奇科夫斯基、洛加—索文斯基、穆霞沃娃、诺瓦克（以上五人是统一工人党）、奥兹加—密哈尔斯基（统一农民党）和扎维斯基（天主教）九人为委员，这些提名在表决中都被一致或者以压倒多数通过。
    会议在休息十五分钟以后，又选举了资格审查委员会和议会章程起草委员会。
    接着议长维策赫宣读现任部长会议主席西伦凯维兹的信。信中说，按照宪法规定，政府向新议会辞职。
    会议接受了政府的辞职，随即选举新部长会议主席。
    这时，哥穆尔卡起立发言。他说，根据各党派的协商，他被委托提名西伦凯维兹为部长会议主席候选人。哥穆尔卡说，我们一致认为西伦凯维兹很好地完成了部长会议主席的职务，并且相信在他的领导下，政府将能够完全实现全国统一阵线的纲领。
    哥穆尔卡的讲话博得了全场热烈的鼓掌。在表决中，西伦凯维兹获得绝大多数议员的拥护而当选。
    会议到此休会，并且决定在26日复会。在休会期间，新的部长会议主席西伦凯维兹将筹组政府。
