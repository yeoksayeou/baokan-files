Xinhua News Agency, 12th — Since the Spring Festival, national coal mines have overfulfilled the production target for the first ten days of February (excluding the increased production figures during the Spring Festival) by 3.9% from the 3rd to the 10th, producing an average of over 8,000 tons of coal more for the country every day. Among them, the Xi'an Bureau of Mines completed 115% of its plan, and the Shenyang Bureau of Mines completed 113.67% of its plan. Compared with the same period last year, national coal mines produced an average of more than 30,000 tons of coal per day.

    In order to consolidate the enthusiasm for increased production during the Spring Festival and ensure the overfulfillment of the first quarter's production target, many units have made specific arrangements. The Liaoyuan Mining Bureau has decided that the working groups dispatched by the bureau and mines to assist in the work of each pit will continue to work, mobilizing cadres and the masses to prevent a slackening mood; the Fuxin Mining Bureau will re-arrange the projects that were not overhauled during the Spring Festival without affecting normal production.

    煤矿工人持续开展增产运动
    每天多生产了八千多吨煤
    二月上旬的生产任务超额完成
    新华社12日讯　全国煤矿在春节以后，从3日到10日超额3.9％完成了2月上旬的生产任务（春节增产的数字除外），平均每天为国家多生产八千多吨煤。其中西安管理局完成计划的115％，沈阳管理局完成计划的113.67％。同去年同期比较，全国煤矿平均每天多生产三万多吨煤。
    为了巩固春节增产的热情，保证超额完成第一季生产任务，不少单位已经做了具体布置。辽源矿务局确定由局、矿派到各坑帮助工作的工作组仍然继续工作，动员干部、群众防止松劲情绪；阜新矿务局对春节未检修的部分工程，将在不影响正常生产的情况下重新进行安排。
