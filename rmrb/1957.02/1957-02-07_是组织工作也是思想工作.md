It is wrong to view streamlining organizations as too difficult, but it is equally wrong to view it as too easy. Streamlining organizations is an organizational task, but it is also an ideological task. The reason it is also an ideological task is that to organize an agency or group more rationally, the masses must be mobilized. In order to mobilize the masses and eliminate various ideological obstacles in the work process, a series of meticulous ideological work must be carried out.

The fact is this:

Many leaders agree with the policy of "streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels." However, when it comes to streamlining their own units, they raise various reasons why streamlining is not possible. For example, they say: "Future tasks are too big, and we won't be able to do the work with too few people." "There have been significant improvements in work since the establishment of separate organizations." "The reason the work was not done well in the past was because the staffing was too small." "Compared with other regions, the organization of this county cannot be said to be large, and the personnel cannot be said to be many."…

It is not that these people do not understand the significance of streamlining organizations, or that they are against streamlining organizations, but that they do not see the bloated organizations and overstaffing in their own units. Therefore, to get these people to implement the policy of "streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels," they must be made to see these situations. To make them see these situations, investigations and research must be organized.

The Ding County Bureau of Commerce and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative put forward very convincing materials and opinions on streamlining the commercial organizations in Ding County's villages and towns. They used many materials to prove that there were too many commercial organizations in the county's villages and towns and that they needed to be streamlined; after streamlining, not only would it not affect the development of commercial work, but it would also provide a lot of convenience for the allocation of materials and the purchase of local people. In this opinion, not only was a streamlining plan put forward, but also three plans were put forward for everyone to compare.

Only by adopting this method can those who disagree with streamlining be sincerely convinced to implement the streamlining policy.

After careful streamlining, many personnel will be streamlined in various places. This is of course good. But some people are worried about this. Where should these people be arranged to go? Yes, where to go? This is a good question.

Among the personnel streamlined, many can be placed in the "lower levels" to work. Many are new to industrial or agricultural production and are still familiar with industrial and agricultural production, or although they have been away from industrial and agricultural production for a long time, they have been leading industrial or agricultural production and are still familiar with production. Many of these people can return to workshops and cooperatives and rejoin industrial or agricultural production. Some people who are physically weak and have lost their ability to work can be mobilized to retire home or be properly resettled. Some female staff members who really cannot work can also be mobilized to go back to engage in household labor.

According to the reporter's understanding, whether it is people who are placed in the "lower levels," or people who return to workshops or cooperatives to participate in production, or people who go back to engage in household labor, there will be many ideological problems.

Here are two examples:

The Hebei Provincial Party Committee recently transferred a group of staff to work at the grassroots level for a relatively long period of time (one year). When the Provincial Party Committee put forward this plan, the responsible persons of various units enthusiastically supported it. However, problems arose when personnel were transferred from various units. Some people said, "The lower levels need people, and the upper levels also need people." Some people said that they could not spare anyone. For example, the Department of Agriculture has eight directors and deputy directors, and no one signed up to go to the countryside, so the higher-level authorities had to designate them; the Department of Transportation has eight directors and deputy directors, and they also said that no one could go down to help with the work. Among the staff members who were transferred, some people also exposed some unhealthy thoughts. For example: they would rather go to the south than to the north; they would rather go to the plains than to the mountains; they would rather go to places with a good work foundation than to places with a bad work foundation… What to do? Only patient ideological education work can be carried out.

When Ding County abolished districts and merged townships, it mobilized a group of township staff to return to production posts. When this issue was raised, a small number of district and township leaders did not agree with this approach and tried every means to prevent these people from continuing to disengage from production work. And some of these township staff members were unwilling to return to production. Within three months after the abolition of districts and the merger of townships, the Organization Department of the Ding County Party Committee received people every two or three days who came to request to continue to be full-time staff members. Some people, although they returned to production, were not in high spirits. Some people even complained, saying: "This is killing the donkey after it has ground the mill."

Therefore, to mobilize a group of staff to go to the "lower levels" and to go into production, a lot of meticulous persuasion and education work must be carried out.

On the other hand, streamlining organizations must also be combined with improving work style and work methods. Now some people's work style and work methods are not very good, using meetings to listen to reports instead of in-depth investigations and research, using issuing many instructions instead of specific guidance work. As a result, there cannot be fewer meetings and documents. The People's Committee of Dongkouqiao Township, Pingxiang County, Hebei Province, received forty-four kinds of forms and reports from August to November last year, with an average of fifty columns in each form and report. The Baoding Municipal People's Soap Factory is a small factory with only thirty-two workers and twelve staff members, but the leadership requires this factory to make sixty-eight kinds of forms and reports, with six copies of each form and report. From January to November last year, this factory made 4,126 forms and reports to the higher authorities. On average, each staff member had to make 344 forms and reports.

This bad work style and work methods are certainly related to bloated organizations and overlapping layers, but especially related to the thinking of the staff. Therefore, while streamlining organizations, education on improving ideological style should also be carried out for all staff members, requiring them to strive to overcome bureaucratic work styles, improve bad work methods, and establish a work style that closely links with reality and closely links with the masses. Only in this way can the purpose of streamlining organizations and improving work efficiency be achieved.

In summary, whether it is reducing the size of organizations, transferring cadres to lower levels, mobilizing cadres to return to production, or improving work style and work methods, all require both meticulous organizational work and patient ideological education work. Treating streamlining organizations as merely organizational work and adopting hasty and simple methods will definitely not be done well.

### 是组织工作也是思想工作

    是组织工作也是思想工作	金沙
    把精简机构看得过于困难是不对的，但是，把它看得过于容易，同样是错误的。精简机构是一件组织工作，但是又是一件思想工作。所以说它又是思想工作，就是说要把一个机关或团体组织得更加合理，就得把群众发动起来。为了发动群众，为了消除工作过程中的各种各样的思想障碍，就要进行一系列的细致的思想工作。
    事实就是如此：
    许多领导人员是同意“精简上层，充实下层”这个方针的。但是在一涉及到本单位的精简问题时，就会提出各种各样不能精简的理由来。例如他们说：“今后的任务太大，人太少了就无法进行工作。”“分设机构以后，工作是有显著改进的。”“过去工作没有做好，就因为编制太小。”“同别的地区比较，这个县的机构不能说大，人员不能说多。”……
    这倒不是这些人不了解精简机构的意义，或者是反对精简机构，而是因为他们没有看到本单位机构庞大，人浮于事的情况。因此要这些人执行“精简上层，充实下层”的方针，就要让他们看到这些情况。要让他们看到这些情况，就要组织调查研究。
    定县商业局和供销社对精简定县乡村商业机构，提出了很有说服力的材料和意见。他们用许多材料证明全县乡村商业机构过多，需要精简；精简以后，不但不会影响商业工作的开展，而且会给调配物资和当地群众购买上以很多的方便。在这个意见书中，不仅提出了一个精简方案，而且提出了三个方案，让大家来比较。
    只有采取这种办法，才能使那些不同意精简的人也心悦诚服地执行精简方针。
    经过认真地精简，各地会精简出不少的人员来。这当然是好的。但是有人因此发起愁来。把这些人安排到哪里去呢？是的，到哪里去呢？这问得很好。
    在精简出来的人员中，有不少人可以放到“下层”去工作。有不少是刚从工业或农业生产中来的，对工业农业生产还很熟悉，或者虽然离开工业农业生产较久，但是一直在领导工业或农业生产，对生产也还熟悉。这些人中有很多人可以回到车间、合作社去，重新参加工业或农业生产。有些身体衰弱已丧失工作能力的人，可以动员他们退休回家或作另外的适当的安置。有些实在不能工作的女工作人员，也可以动员她们回去从事家庭劳动。
    据记者了解，不论是放到“下层”去的人，还是回到车间或合作社中去参加生产的人，还是回去从事家庭劳动的人，都会有着不少的思想问题。
    举两个例子：
    河北省委最近抽调一批工作人员比较长期（一年）地下去帮助工作。在省委提出这个方案时，各单位的负责人员都是热烈拥护的。但是在向各单位抽调人员时，就发生了问题。有人说“下边需要，上边也需要。”有人说抽不出人来。例如农业厅有八个正副厅长，没有人报名下乡，要上级机关指定；交通厅有八个正副厅长，也说没有人可以下去帮助工作。在被抽调的工作人员中，也有部分人暴露了一些不健康的思想。例如：愿意到南边去，不愿意到北边去；愿意到平原去，不愿意到山地去；愿意到工作基础好的地方去，不愿意到工作不好的地方去……。怎么办呢？只有进行耐心的思想教育工作。
    定县撤区并乡时，曾动员一批乡的工作人员回到生产岗位上。在提出这个问题时，少数区、乡负责人员就不大同意这种作法，而且多方设法让这些人继续脱离生产工作。而这些乡的工作人员中也有人不愿意回到生产中去。定县县委组织部，撤区并乡以后的三个月内，三天两头有人来要求继续当专职工作人员。有些人虽然回到生产中去了，但情绪不高。有些人甚至发牢骚说：“这是卸磨杀驴。”
    因此，要动员一批工作人员到“下层”去，到生产中去，就要进行许多细致的说服教育工作。
    另一方面，精简机构，还必须结合改进工作作风和工作方法。现在有些人的工作作风和工作方法是不大好的，用开会听汇报的方法来代替深入的调查研究，用多发指示的方法来代替具体指导工作。这样，会议文件不能不多。河北平乡县东口桥乡人民委员会，从去年8月到11月，收到表报四十四种，每种表报平均有五十个栏目。保定市人民造胰厂是一个只有三十二名工人、十二名工作人员的小厂，但是领导上要求这个厂作的表报有六十八种，每种表报造六份。去年1月到11月，这个厂向上边作了四千一百二十六份表报。平均每个工作人员要造表三百四十四份。
    这种不好的工作作风和工作方法，固然和机构臃肿，层次重叠有关，但是尤其和工作人员的思想有关。因此在精简机构的同时，还应对全体工作人员进行关于改进思想作风的教育，要他们努力克服官僚主义作风，改进不好的工作方法，树立起密切联系实际密切联系群众的工作作风。只有这样，才能达到精简机构，提高工作效率的目的。
    综上所述，不管是减缩机构，下放干部，动员干部回到生产中去，以及改进工作作风和工作方法，都是既需要细致的组织工作，更需要耐心的思想教育工作。把精简机构仅仅看作是组织工作，采取草率简单的办法是一定作不好的。
