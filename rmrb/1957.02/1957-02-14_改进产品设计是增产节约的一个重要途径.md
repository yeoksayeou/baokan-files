    Improving Product Design is an Important Way to Increase Production and Practice Economy
    By our reporter Ji Yin
    Not long ago, the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Product Design Company received a design task: to design a complete set of ramie textile machines for a new factory in Guangzhou – the Ramie Textile Factory. The designers set off to various textile factories to survey all the machines they needed. If they followed the old practice, their task would have been completed once the surveying was done and the machine drawings were produced. However, this time they were not satisfied with the old way of doing things, and they carefully checked the entire design.
    Why check the design? Huang Zupei, of the Technology Section of the Design Company, told me: China has never designed a set of machines specifically for ramie factories. The machines used in the past were copied from foreign products. In fact, these foreign machines were not necessarily advanced, and most of them are already very old. The result of this inspection proved that there are many wasteful and unreasonable aspects of these machines. As long as some obviously unreasonable parts are modified, the whole set of machines can save one hundred tons of steel, and it can also be more reasonable and more convenient to use than the original design.
    This practice of the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Product Design Company is now being widely applied in other light and heavy industrial sectors in Shanghai. I once visited the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory. Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, together with other rubber factories in Shanghai, successfully improved the design of the 10.00-20 truck tires. Zeng Yanmu, a designer at the factory, showed me the appearance of this truck tire. He said: Before the design was improved, the guaranteed mileage of this tire was only 15,000 kilometers, and it often failed to reach that. A large number of tires were scrapped before reaching 10,000 kilometers, and the factory paid a lot of compensation every year for this. What caused the large number of early tire failures? They had repeatedly studied this and found that the original design was unreasonable.
    Speaking of the original design, this young technician smiled. He said: In the past capitalist management period, the tire workshop of the Da Zhonghua Factory was absolutely confidential. The door of the workshop was a specially made iron door, which was kept closed all day long to prevent people from other factories from sneaking in and stealing the secrets of tire manufacturing. In fact, their truck tires were not independently designed, but dissected foreign tires and then copied them into drawings for production. As for why these tires were designed in this way and whether they were suitable for Chinese vehicles and roads, they were not clear about it. That was the whole "secret." This time, the Shanghai rubber factories found in their inspections that the past imitation had a great deal of blindness, so they completely revised the original design and removed two layers of cord fabric. According to the new design, the test results showed that the driving mileage reached 75,000 kilometers, several times more than the original guaranteed mileage. Now, Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory is also making such modifications to the design of rickshaw tires, rubber shoes and other rubber products.
    Starting from strengthening product design work, this is an important development in the work of increasing production and practicing economy in Shanghai factories and enterprises this year. After many factories paid attention to strengthening this work, they opened up an important way to increase production and practice economy, the movement became more vigorous, some saved a lot of raw materials, some improved product quality, or reduced product costs. Some found new sources of materials, relieving the threat of insufficient raw material supply. Although only a part of the factories in Shanghai have carried out this work so far, their remarkable achievements prove that the potential for improving design work can be said to be endless.
    Why is there such a large potential to tap in improving product design? This is because product design work is one of the weakest departments in Shanghai's industrial production. This is also a characteristic of old China's industry. Although Shanghai's industry, which developed under semi-colonial conditions, has undergone great development and changes since liberation, its technical level is still low. One of the characteristics of low technical level is the lack of independent design capabilities. Many machine products are still being produced according to the old foreign product models. Most of these products are old and backward, the machines are bulky, the materials are wasted, the efficiency is not high, and they are not suitable for the specific conditions of China. This is its characteristic. In the previous period, the Shanghai local heavy industry department touched on the situation of joint state-private factories, which proved that the waste in this area was extremely alarming. For example, a printing machine factory in Shanghai is still producing the Miller-style folio printing machine from the United States more than twenty years ago. This machine wastes materials and can only print thirty-two to thirty-four sheets per minute, while the new printing machine has already reached fifty sheets per minute, and the style is much lighter. For example, the stoker of the Babcock boiler currently produced by some small factories in Shanghai can save eight tons of steel per unit with some reasonable modifications, accounting for 21% of the total material consumption; according to the current production tasks, more than 400 tons of steel can be saved in one year. Not long ago, the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory changed the three-gas-bag boiler to a two-gas-bag boiler, which can save 30 tons of iron per boiler. In fact, this two-gas-bag is not the most advanced design. Some technologically advanced countries have already changed to single-gas-bag. Indeed, we currently know too little about the industrial technology improvements in various countries. Recently, a Japanese technician visited the Shanghai local state-owned weighing instrument factory. He was surprised to see that the balance beam of the factory's scale was made of copper. He said: Weighing instrument factories that still use copper in this way are probably rare in the world. People have long used other metals instead, and the volume of the scale has mostly been reduced.
    The situation of backward and wasteful product design is also common in daily consumer goods. Many daily consumer goods in Shanghai have not been modified for decades. For example, a double-bell alarm clock produced by the Shanghai Clock Factory has an outdated and ugly style and uses a lot of materials. Recently, the Shanghai Henderley Clock Factory redesigned a single-set small table clock. The overall volume of its parts is only two-fifths of that of the old alarm clock, and each clock uses five taels less copper, which is both beautiful and practical. According to rough calculations, just by changing it like this, the factory can increase its production of more than 150,000 table clocks a year.
    It can be seen from the above facts that strengthening product design can not only reasonably save raw materials, improve product quality, and reduce product costs to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy, but also inevitably promote the technical transformation of enterprises and drive a series of reforms in enterprise production technology. Product design is the first and decisive link in the factory's production activities. To carry out the technical transformation of enterprises, we need to do a lot of technical work. One of the most important tasks is to gradually get rid of our backward situation of simply relying on foreign drawings and imitating foreign products in product design work, and cultivate independent design capabilities. By improving product design activities, we can unify the long-term task of enterprise technical transformation with the current task of increasing production and practicing economy. Factories that have done this work relatively well, such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory and the Second Textile Machinery Factory, have truly deepened the activities of increasing production and practicing economy into production, and have condensed with the activities of technical transformation, becoming consolidated and lasting activities. The technical personnel who had been unable to move in the past have now become a very active force.
    However, the work of improving product design is a complex organizational work. It cannot be "rushed up" by some drumming and gongs. According to Shanghai's experience, the work of improving product design needs to adopt a policy that is both active and cautious. That is, first of all, we must boldly support the efforts of design and technical personnel and give them full trust and specific help. Some factories in Shanghai have encountered great resistance in this regard. Some people underestimate China's current design level, believing that products can only be imitated according to foreign products forever, and that they do not have the ability to design good products themselves, and groundlessly doubt and obstruct the efforts of the technical personnel in their own factories. In fact, many products in Shanghai that have been improved in design are far better than the original foreign products. For example, the state-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory has improved the heavy and inefficient spinning machine, reducing the weight of the seven-ton machine to about five tons, and increasing the speed of the machine from 9,000 revolutions per minute in the past to 13,000 revolutions per minute. The power consumption of the machine has also been reduced, and the overall quality has been improved. Because the machine has been rationally simplified in the improved design, the machining man-hours are more than half less than in the past, and the product cost is reduced by half. Many successful facts have proved that our technical design personnel are capable of undertaking the task of improving product design.
    On the other hand, we also need to take a cautious attitude towards improving product design. In the process of work, we must discuss and study more, especially before putting it into production, we must make careful identification and testing. It is better to be slower and better, and do not easily let go of even a small problem that seems to be small. Otherwise, reckless actions will cause losses. Not long ago, in order to save aluminum, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory changed the aluminum protective covers of some machine tools to cast iron. It seemed that this improvement was no problem, but later it was found that because cast iron was much heavier than aluminum, the accuracy of the machine tool was affected. Although this was not a serious accident and was quickly corrected, the lesson is worth remembering.

    改进产品设计是增产节约的一个重要途径
    本报记者　季音
    不久以前，上海机电产品设计公司接到了一个设计任务：为广州的一个新工厂——苎麻纺织厂设计一整套苎麻纺织机。设计人员出发到各地的一些纺织厂去，将各种需要的机器一一进行了测绘。如果按过去的做法，测绘完毕，画出机器图纸，他们的任务就算完了。但是，这一次他们没有满足于过去的做法，他们对全部的设计进行了仔细的检查。
    为什么要检查设计呢？设计公司技术科黄祖培同志对我说：中国国内自己没有设计过一套专供苎麻厂的机器，过去所用的机器都是测绘外国的产品而仿制的，其实这些外国机器不一定先进，现在大部分已经很老旧了。这次检查的结果，证明这些机器有许多浪费和不合理的地方，只要把一些显著不合理的部分修改一下，全套机器就可以节省一百吨钢材，而且还可比原设计更合理，使用时更方便。
    上海机电产品设计公司的这个做法，在上海其他轻、重工业部门里，现在也都在普遍地应用着。我曾经访问了大中华橡胶厂。大中华橡胶厂和上海其他橡胶厂一起，在改进10.00—20型的卡车轮胎的设计方面获得了成功。厂的设计人员曾燕沐，拿出了这种卡车轮胎的样子给我看，他说：这种轮胎在改进设计以前，它的保证里程只有一万五千公里，实际上经常达不到，大批轮胎走不到一万公里就报废了，厂里每年都为此付出了很多赔款。造成轮胎大量早期损坏的原因是什么呢？他们曾为此进行了反复的研究，发现了原设计不合理。
    说到原设计，这位年轻的技术人员笑了起来。他说：在过去资本主义经营时期，大中华厂的轮胎车间是绝对保密的，车间的大门是特制的铁门，终日紧闭，为的是防止别厂的人混进去偷走了制造轮胎的机密。而实际上，他们的卡车轮胎也不是自己独立设计的，而是解剖了外国轮胎，然后依样画葫芦地测绘成图纸，进行生产。至于这些轮胎为什么要设计成这样？它是否适合中国的车辆和道路？也并不了然。全部的“秘密”就是如此。这次，上海各橡胶厂在检查中才发现过去的仿制带有很大的盲目性，便将原设计进行了彻底的修改，去掉了两层帘布。按照新设计制造的轮胎，试验结果行驶里程达到七万五千公里，超过原来的保证里程好几倍。现在大中华橡胶厂正在对力车胎、胶鞋等其他橡胶制品的设计也进行这样的修改。
    从加强产品设计工作入手，这是今年上海工厂企业中增产节约工作的一个重要发展。许多工厂在注意加强了这个工作之后，增产节约工作便打开了一条重要的出路，运动就更加有了生气，有的节约了大量的原材料，有的提高了产品质量，或者降低了产品的成本。有的找到了新的材料来源，解除了原料供应不足的威胁。上海目前虽然还只是一部分工厂进行了这一工作，但它们的显著成就，证明了改进设计工作方面的潜力可以说是无穷无尽的。
    为什么在改进产品设计方面有这样大的潜力可挖呢？这是因为产品设计工作是上海工业生产中最薄弱的部门之一。这也正是旧中国工业的特点。在半殖民地条件下发展起来的上海工业，在解放后虽然有了很大的发展和变化，但它的技术水平还是低的。技术水平低的特征之一就是缺乏独立设计能力，许多机器产品依然仿照着很久以前的外国产品型式在进行生产，这些产品大部分都已陈旧而落后，机器笨重，用料浪费，效率不高，不适合中国具体条件，这都是它的特点。上海地方重工业部门前一时期曾摸了一下公私合营厂的情况，证明这方面的浪费是极为惊人的。例如上海有一家印刷机厂至今还在生产二十多年前美国的密勒式对开印刷机，这种机器用料浪费，每分钟只能印三十二到三十四张，而新式印刷机早就达到每分钟五十张，样式要比它轻巧得多。又如目前上海一些小厂在生产的一种拔伯葛式锅炉的加煤机，合理地作些修改，每台就可节省八吨钢材，占用料总量的21％；按目前的生产任务，一年就可省钢材四百多吨。国营上海锅炉厂不久前把三气包锅炉修改为二气包，每台锅炉即可省三十吨铁材。其实这种二气包也不是最先进的设计，目前一些技术上先进的国家，早已改成为单气包了。确实，我们目前对于世界各国工业技术改进的情况，是知道得太少了，最近，有一个日本的技术人员参观了上海地方国营的衡器厂，他看到这个厂的磅秤横尺都是用铜做的，感到很惊讶，他说：磅秤上还在这样用铜的衡器厂恐怕在世界上已很少见了，人们早已用别的金属代替，磅秤的体积也大都改小了。
    产品设计落后而浪费的情况，在日用工业品中也是普遍现象。上海有许多日用工业品已几十年没有修改了。如上海钟表厂生产的一种双铃闹钟，式样陈旧难看，用料又多，最近上海亨得利钟厂改设计了一种单套小型台钟，它的机件总体积只有旧闹钟的五分之二，每只钟可少用五两铜，既美观又实用。据粗略计算，仅仅这样改变一下，这个工厂一年就可增产十五万多只台钟。
    从上边所讲的这些事实中可以看出，加强了产品设计，它不但可以合理地节约原材料，提高产品质量，降低产品成本，达到增产节约的目的，而且还必然地会促进企业的技术改造工作，带动企业一系列生产技术工作的改革。产品设计是工厂生产活动中具有决定意义的第一个环节。我们要进行企业的技术改造，需要作许多技术工作，其中最重要的工作之一就是逐步地摆脱我们在产品设计工作上单纯依赖国外图纸、仿制国外产品的落后状况，培养独立设计能力。而通过改进产品设计的活动，就把企业技术改造的长期任务与当前的增产节约任务统一起来了。凡是这个工作做得比较好的厂，如上海机床厂、第二纺织机械厂等，增产节约活动真正深入到了生产中去，并和技术改造的活动凝结在一起，成为巩固、持久的活动，过去一直动不起来的技术人员现在成了一支很活跃的力量。
    但是改进产品设计的工作，是一个复杂的组织工作。它不是用一些敲锣打鼓的鼓动办法就可以“轰”起来的。根据上海的经验，改进产品设计的工作需要采取既积极而又慎重的方针。即首先要大胆地支持设计技术人员们的努力，给以充分的信任和具体的帮助。上海有些厂在这方面曾遇到过很大的阻力，有些人低估了我国目前的设计水平，认为产品永远只能按照国外产品仿制，自己没有能力设计出好的产品，对本厂技术人员们的努力无端地怀疑、阻挠。事实上，上海不少工厂改进设计以后的产品，都远比原来的国外产品为好。如上海国营第二纺织机械厂改进了机身笨重、效能不高的精纺机，使七吨重的机器减轻到五吨左右，机器的转速由过去的每分钟九千转提高到一万三千转，机器的耗电量也降低了，整个质量都提高了。由于在改进设计中合理地简化了机器，因而机器加工工时比过去减少了一半多，产品成本降低了一半。许多成功的事实，证明了我国技术设计人员是有能力担负起改进产品设计的任务的。
    另一方面，我们也需要对改进产品设计采取慎重的态度。在工作过程中，一定要多商量，多研究，尤其在投入生产之前，必须作认真的鉴定，试验，宁可慢些，必须好些，不要轻易地放过那怕是一个看来细小的问题。否则，轻举妄动，就会造成损失。不久前，上海机床厂为了节省铝，曾将一些机床上铝质的防护罩，改为生铁的，看来这个改进是毫无问题的，但后来发现，由于生铁远较铝为重，使机床的精密度受到了影响。这虽然不是一件严重的事故，而且也很快纠正了，但这个教训是值得记取的。
