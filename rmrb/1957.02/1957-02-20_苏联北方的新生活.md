    Moscow Dispatch, February 19th. Since the October Revolution, a new life has emerged in the Soviet North. Tarasov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, recently discussed interesting developments there in "Ogonyok" magazine.
    The Soviet North, bordering Norway to the west and reaching the Pacific Ocean to the east, is vast and expansive. During the years of socialist construction, the face of the North has changed rapidly.
    Murmansk is no longer a desolate place. The first-class ice-free port of Murmansk has grown on the Barents Sea coast, and many fishing fleets have appeared. Kirovsk's chemical industry produces mineral fertilizers from the world's richest apatite mines. The Monchegorsk and Norilsk non-ferrous metal smelters are working on the Kola Peninsula and the Taimyr tundra, producing nickel and other non-ferrous metals. The Vorkuta coal mining area is now called the Donbas of the Arctic Circle. Uhta's oil refineries produce petroleum products.
    Various modes of transportation link the northern borderlands with the entire Soviet Union. The Northern Pechora Railway extends to Ukhta, Vorkuta, and down to the lower reaches of the Ob River. The Northern Sea Route has been opened, the shortest route between east and west. Thousands of kilometers of highways cross the tundra and mountains. From Moscow, you can fly to any city in the Arctic Circle.
    The Yakuts and Komi people are the most populous ethnic groups in the North, and they have had autonomous national organizations for more than 30 years. The Yakutsk and Komi Autonomous Republics are the two largest territories among the fourteen autonomous republics of the Russian Federation. Many ethnic groups in the North have autonomous regions, and they have representatives in the Nationalities Chamber of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.
    Agricultural collectivization has united workers in the tundra and forest zones into cooperatives for reindeer herding, hunting, and fishing. The Soviet government, through an extensive network of consumer cooperatives, supplies them with goods and tools. The hunting and animal husbandry industries in the North produce more than half of the country's furs, including the most valuable squirrel, sable, silver fox, and Arctic fox pelts. Michurin's agricultural biology extends agriculture into the Arctic Circle. In places where people used to suffer from scurvy due to lack of vitamins, northern state farms now supply people with potatoes, cabbage, and fresh milk. The way of life of the northern ethnic groups has also changed. Many nomadic peoples have become settled. Villages are growing in places where tents used to stand.
    Before the revolution, northern residents were almost entirely illiterate. Even the more populous Yakut people had no written language. Now Yakutsk has a university. There are more than 600 schools in the national regions of the North, where more than 40,000 students are studying. The pedagogical schools in various regions are preparing teachers for them at the Northern Nationalities Department of the Leningrad and Herzen Pedagogical Institutes. About 22,000 doctors and medical personnel are now working in the North. The Buryat Medical Institute and the secondary schools in the national regions are training medical personnel from northern ethnic groups. A national intelligentsia is growing. Among the young Yakuts, Chukchi, Evenki, and Nenets, you can find teachers, doctors, pilots, radio operators, scientists, writers, and actors.
    In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet North, Siberia, and the Far East occupy a prominent position. The large natural gas deposits discovered in the lower reaches of the Ob River can supply Ural industry with cheap fuel. Diamond mines are being developed in Yakutia. Many new mineral deposits will be developed in Chukotka. The northern coast is currently being further developed. The Arctic fleet will be supplemented with new ships, including the first icebreakers with nuclear-powered engines. (Attached picture)

    苏联北方的新生活
    本报莫斯科19日电　十月革命以来，苏联的北方出现了新的生活。苏联俄罗斯联邦共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席塔拉索夫最近在“星火”杂志上谈到了那里发展的有趣的情景。
    苏联北方，西边和挪威交界，东边到太平洋，辽远广阔。在社会主义建设的年月中，北方的面貌迅速改变了。
    摩尔曼斯克再不是荒凉的地方了。在巴仑支海边成长了头等的摩尔曼斯克不冻港，出现了许多捕鱼船队。基洛夫斯克化学工业，以世界上最丰富的磷灰石矿出产矿物肥料。在科拉半岛和泰麦尔的苔原上工作着蒙切哥尔斯克和诺里尔斯克多种金属冶炼厂，它们出产镍和其他有色金属。伯绍拉煤矿区现在被叫做北极圈里的顿巴斯。乌赫塔的油厂出产石油制品。
    各种交通把北部边疆和苏联全国联结起来。北方伯绍拉铁路伸向乌赫塔，沃尔库塔，直到鄂毕河下游。北方的海路开辟了，它是东西之间最短的航线。几千公里的公路穿越苔原和山脉。从莫斯科可以乘飞机到北极圈里的任何城市。
    雅库特人和科米人是北方人口最多的民族，他们已经有三十多年自主的国家组织。雅库次克和科米自治共和国是俄罗斯联邦十四个自治共和国中领土最大的两个。北方的许多民族都有自治州，在苏联最高苏维埃的民族院有它们的代表。
    农业集体化把苔原和森林地带的劳动者联合在养鹿、打猎和捕鱼的合作社里。苏维埃政府经过广泛的消费合作社网，供给他们商品和劳动工具。北方的打猎业和养畜业出产全苏半数以上的皮毛，包括最贵重的灰鼠皮、黑貂皮、银鼠皮、北极狐皮。米丘林的农业生物学使农业伸到北极圈里去。在原先人们因为缺乏维他命而患坏血病的地方，现在有北方的国营农场供给人们洋芋、白菜和新鲜牛奶。北方各族人民的生活方式也起了变化。许多游牧民族成为定居民族。在搭帐篷的地方成长着村庄。
    革命前北方居民几乎全是文盲。甚至人口较多的雅库特人也没有文字。现在雅库次克城有大学。在北方各民族州有六百多所学校，四万多学生在那里学习。各地的师范学校由列宁格勒和伯力的师范学院的北方民族系，替他们准备教员。现在约有二万二千医生和医务人员在北方工作。伯力医学院和各民族州的中等学校培养着北方民族的医务人员。民族知识分子成长着。在年青的雅库特人、楚克契人、埃文基人、连采人中可以遇见教员、医生、飞行员、无线电员、科学家、作家和演员。
    在第六个五年计划中，苏联的北方和西伯利亚、远东都占有显要的地位。在鄂毕河下游发现的大量天然气矿，可以供给乌拉尔工业以便宜的燃料。在雅库特亚开采金刚石矿。在楚科特卡将开发许多新的矿藏。目前北方海边正在进一步发展着。北极船队将补充新的轮舶，包括第一批带着原子能发动机的破冰船。（附图片）
