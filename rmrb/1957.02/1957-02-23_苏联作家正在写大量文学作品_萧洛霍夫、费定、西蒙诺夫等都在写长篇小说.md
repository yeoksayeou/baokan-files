The famous author of the novel "Time, Forward!" Kataev is writing "Peace in the Hut," a work with the theme of the October Revolution and the establishment of Soviet power in the South.

    The writers Polevoi and Katelinskaya, who recently visited China, are writing features about China. The first feature written by Polevoi, "30,000 Li in China," was recently published in the "October" magazine.
