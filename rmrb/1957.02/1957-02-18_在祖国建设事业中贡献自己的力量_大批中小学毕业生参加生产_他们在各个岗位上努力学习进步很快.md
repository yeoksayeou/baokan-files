To contribute their strength to the construction of the motherland

A large number of primary and secondary school graduates participate in production

They study hard and make rapid progress in various positions

(Our Newspaper) News: In 1956, many middle and primary school graduates participated in industrial and agricultural production and various national construction undertakings.

According to incomplete statistics, last year alone, 600,000 middle and primary school graduates joined the industrial front. Last year, Jiangsu Province had more than 40,000 junior high school and senior primary school graduates participating in various national construction projects. Some of them were in the Northeast Geological Exploration Team, some went to Qaidam and Karamay, and some worked in factories and mines. Many young students from Chongqing City and Leshan Prefecture in Sichuan also went to Qinghai to participate in construction, all with a cultural level of junior high school graduation or above. In the spring of last year, more than 1,100 junior high school graduates in Beijing participated in industrial production. Some were able to carry out production independently after studying for more than a month in machine tool factories. More than 400 young students from Guangzhou went to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to participate in Party, government, industrial and commercial administration, and various technical departments. More than 700 female junior high school graduates from Qingdao participated in technical work such as geological exploration and coal mine design in areas such as Xi'an, Urumqi, and Changsha. They were all able to study technology diligently and complete their tasks.

Last year, more than 92,000 middle and primary school graduates studied at worker technical schools. After graduation, they will become a new force on the industrial front.

On the agricultural production front, many middle and primary school graduates also participated in labor. More than 500 young students from Kunming went to the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan to reclaim wasteland. More than 900 Han Chinese junior high school and senior primary school graduates from Hainan Island went to the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture to serve as accountants in agricultural cooperatives, voluntarily going in response to the call of the Hainan Island District Committee of the Communist Party of China. A youth voluntary reclamation team from Shanghai settled in Fuliang, De'an, and other counties in Jiangxi. In Beijing, more than 800 middle and primary school graduates participated in agricultural production last year.

A large number of young students have also been absorbed into various service industries that are indispensable to people's lives. In Beijing, more than 27,000 young people have become barbers, ticket sellers, telephone operators, postal workers, and broadcasters. In the technical training courses organized by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Social Welfare, more than 300 young students are learning techniques such as cooking, photography, and hairdressing. Some young students are also apprentices in the service industry. They are growing up quickly. For example, Zhang Ruzhi, a senior primary school graduate, worked as a trainee at the Siliang Barber Shop. After only two months of work, he learned general hairdressing techniques and was praised by customers and his work unit.

Before the summer vacation in 1956, the Ministry of Education issued a notice on the publicity, education, and organizational work for senior primary school graduates to enter higher education and engage in labor production, requiring schools in various places to educate graduates and rationally arrange the organizational work for entering higher education and engaging in labor production. At present, education departments in many provinces have also issued notices requiring schools to strengthen labor education for students. The Education Department of Liaoning Province requires all schools to conduct practical education for students on their prospects for entering higher education and participating in labor production. The Education Department of Hunan Province requires all schools to strengthen guidance to graduating students on entering higher education and employment, and to establish a correct attitude towards entering higher education and labor production.

Also News: In 1956, more than 800 senior primary school and junior high school graduates in the suburbs of Beijing participated in agricultural production.

Many of these middle and primary school graduates have now taken on the work of accountants, statistics keepers, work recorders, and librarians. Some have been rated as model members because of their active work.

In order to train agricultural technicians, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry held various training courses last year, and many of the students were senior primary school and junior high school students. Because they have a certain amount of cultural knowledge, they make rapid progress in learning technology. Most of the students in the locomobile operator training class are senior primary school graduates. After half a month of study, they all became locomobile operators, which played a significant role in suburban water conservancy and irrigation. The Nanyuan Tractor Station training class also absorbed more than 300 young students with senior primary school qualifications last year. After their spring plowing production internship this year, they will graduate and officially participate in work.

Many of the senior primary school graduates and junior high school students who participated in agricultural production before 1956 have become the backbone of agricultural cooperatives, holding important positions such as directors, team leaders, and accountants. They are already familiar with and even proficient in their own business. Zhou Liqin, a Beijing model worker and accountant of the Yongqing Agricultural Cooperative in Dongran Village Township, is a senior primary school graduate. She started working as an accountant in 1955, and handled more than 30,000 accounts in one year without a single mistake. Gong Chengduo, the statistics keeper of the Tiancun Agricultural Cooperative in Shijingshan District, was rated as a model member because of his good work.

    在祖国建设事业中贡献自己的力量
    大批中小学毕业生参加生产
    他们在各个岗位上努力学习进步很快
    本报讯　1956年，许多中学和小学毕业生参加工农业生产劳动和各项国家建设事业。
    据不完全统计，去年一年内，有六十万中学和小学毕业生投入工业战线。江苏省去年有四万多初中、高小毕业生参加了国家的各项建设工作，他们有的在东北地质勘查队里，有的到了柴达木和克拉玛依，有的在厂矿企业工作。四川重庆市和乐山专区也有许多青年学生到青海参加建设，他们都具有初中毕业以上的文化程度。北京市在去年春天，有一千一百多名初中毕业学生参加工业生产，有的在机床厂内经过一个多月的学习，就能独立进行生产。广州市的四百多青年学生到新疆维吾尔自治区，参加了党、政、工商业行政和各项技术部门工作。青岛市的七百多名初中毕业的女学生，在西安、乌鲁木齐、长沙等地区参加了地质勘查、煤矿设计等技术工作。她们都能刻苦学习技术，完成任务。
    去年，还有九万二千多名中、小学毕业生在工人技术学校学习。他们毕业后，将成为工业战线上一支新生的力量。
    在农业生产战线上，也有许多中学和小学毕业生参加劳动。昆明市五百多名青年学生，到云南西双版纳傣族自治州去开垦荒地。海南岛九百多名汉族初中、高小毕业生，到海南岛黎族苗族自治州去担任农业合作社的会计，他们是响应中共海南岛区委员会的号召自愿去的。上海市一支青年志愿垦荒队在江西的浮梁、德安等县安了家。北京市在去年内，有八百多名中、小学毕业生参加了农业生产。
    在人民生活中不可缺少的各种服务性行业中，也吸收了大量的青年学生参加。北京市有两万七千多名青年成为理发员、售票员、电话员、邮递员、广播员。在北京市社会福利事业局举办的技术训练班里，有三百多青年学生学习烹饪、照像、理发等技术，也有一些青年学生在服务性行业当徒工。他们的成长很快。例如高小毕业生张汝芝在四联理发馆当练习生，刚刚工作两个月的时间，就学会了一般的理发技术，受到顾客和本单位的好评。
    1956年暑假前，教育部即发出了关于高小毕业生升学和从事劳动生产的宣传教育、组织工作的通知，要求各地学校向毕业生进行教育，并合理安排升学和从事劳动生产的组织工作。目前，许多省的教育厅也发出了通知，要求对学生加强劳动教育。辽宁省教育厅要求各学校对学生进行切合实际的升学、参加劳动生产的前途教育。湖南省教育厅要求各学校加强对毕业班学生升学和就业的指导，树立他们对升学和劳动生产的正确态度。
    又讯　1956年，北京市郊区有八百多名高小毕业生和初中毕业生参加了农业生产。
    这些中、小学毕业生中，许多人现在已担任了会计、统计保管员、记工员、图书管理员的工作。有的因为工作积极，已被评为模范社员。
    为了培养农业技术人员，去年北京市农林局举办了各种训练班，学员中有不少是高小、初中的学生。由于他们有一定的文化知识，学起技术来，进步都很快。锅驼机手训练班里，绝大部分的学员是高小毕业生。经过半个月的学习，他们都成了锅驼机手，对郊区水利灌溉工作，起了显著的作用。南苑拖拉机站训练班，去年也吸收了三百多名高小程度以上的青年学生。他们在今年春耕生产实习以后，就要结业正式参加工作。
    1956年以前参加农业生产的高小毕业生和初中学生，有很多人已成了农业合作社里的骨干，担任了社长、队长、会计等重要职务。他们已熟悉甚至精通了自己本行的业务。北京市劳动模范、东冉村乡永青农业社会计周立琴，是个高小毕业生，1955年开始做会计工作，一年内过手的账目三万多笔，没有一笔出过差错。石景山区田村农业社统计保管员巩成铎，因为工作做得好，被评为模范社员。
