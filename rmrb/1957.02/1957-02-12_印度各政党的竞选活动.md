    Indian Political Parties' Campaign Activities
    India's second general election will begin in the latter half of this month, and all parties are stepping up their campaign activities.
    The national parties recognized by the Indian Election Commission are the Congress Party, the Communist Party of India, the People's Socialist Party, and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. According to regulations, only parties that have obtained at least 3% of the votes in the previous general election can be recognized as national parties. In addition to the four national parties, some smaller parties are also participating in the campaign.
    In the upcoming general election, India's 200 million voters will elect 500 members of the People's Assembly and 2,906 members of the State Legislative Assemblies (another 196 members of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council have already been elected in 1955). According to newspaper reports, approximately 15,000 candidate lists have been submitted as of January 29. The campaign situation shows that the upcoming general election will mainly be a competition between the Congress Party and left-wing parties, especially the Communist Party of India. The Congress Party's campaign propaganda initially targeted the Communist Party of India and the People's Socialist Party. In his campaign speeches, Nehru has been vehemently attacking the policies of the Communist Party of India and the Marxist doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat. So far, the main content of the Congress Party leaders' campaign speeches has been to emphasize India's foreign policy, the achievements of the first five-year plan and the implementation of the second five-year plan, as well as the slogans put forward in the Congress Party's campaign manifesto: "Socialism, democracy and peaceful methods".
    Nehru began the Congress Party's campaign in Delhi at a public gathering in Ramlila Square on the evening of February 3. At the request of the Congress Party's state committees, he made campaign trips to Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, and Aurangabad. Home Minister Pant, Congress Party President Debar, and other Congress Party leaders are also actively engaged in campaign activities. The Indian press pointed out that the Congress Party organization is making every effort to use Nehru's personal prestige to carry out the campaign.
    The Congress Party has raised a large amount of campaign funds. According to the "Hindustan Times," the Congress Party will spend one million rupees on publicity alone. The Congress Party bought more than 100 jeeps and 1,600 loudspeakers. It is also using 2,000 gramophone records, advertising paintings, mobile film screening vehicles, and other means of transportation. Leaders of the People's Socialist Party said that most of the Congress Party's campaign funds were provided by industrialists and monopoly capitalists. Triloki Singh, general secretary of the People's Socialist Party, said that in Uttar Pradesh alone, sugar industrialists had donated 2.5 million rupees, and textile and oil tycoons in Kanpur had also donated 2.5 million rupees to the Congress Party as campaign funds. Asoka Mehta said that Tata Steel Company donated 2 million rupees as the Congress Party's campaign fund.
    The Communist Party of India is also strengthening its campaign movement. Communist Party leaders Ajoy Ghosh and A.K. Gopalan are making campaign trips across the country. The Communist Party of India emphasizes the unity of all left-wing and democratic forces and the formation of a strong democratic opposition in order to end the Congress Party's monopoly. It strongly criticizes the Congress Party's mistakes on domestic economic issues, exposes the suffering of workers and peasants, unemployment, exorbitant taxes, and other phenomena. It advocates breaking the control of British capital over important sectors of the Indian economy and curbing monopoly capitalists. It demands land for peasants and agricultural laborers. The Communist Party of India demands that India withdraw from the British Commonwealth and cooperate more closely with socialist countries.
    In its campaign program, the People's Socialist Party criticizes the Congress Party for not being thorough enough in opposing foreign monopoly capital and demands withdrawal from the Commonwealth. It advocates nationalizing "all basic industries," including plantations owned by foreigners, but with full compensation; turning the land over to the peasants while compensating the landlords. It advocates "economic decentralization," that is, only developing handicrafts. It believes that India is unable to develop large-scale industries.
    The Bharatiya Jana Sangh is trying to win the votes of orthodox Hindus. It raised the slogan of danger from Pakistan and therefore urged strengthening defense. It advocates establishing a "unified India" after "eliminating" Pakistan.
    In the 1951-1952 general election, the Congress Party received approximately 45% of all parliamentary votes, but won 74.43% of all parliamentary seats. Similarly, in the elections to the State Legislative Assemblies, the Congress Party obtained 42.36% of the votes, but obtained 68.56% of all seats.
    The results of the last general election showed that the Communist Party of India became the largest opposition party, with twenty-six seats in the People's Assembly and one hundred and seventy-three seats in the State Legislative Assemblies.
    In order to strengthen its chances of winning in this general election, the Congress Party has allowed the Akali Dal (the Sikh ethnic party in Punjab) to join its ranks. Therefore, several of the Congress Party's candidates in Punjab are members of the Akali Dal. The Congress Party also has the support of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and the Anglo-Indian Association. The Christian Church in Kerala and the big landlords in Rajasthan also support the Congress Party.
    The Communist Party of India and the People's Socialist Party have not been able to organize a united front on a national scale to participate in this general election. However, these two parties and three other left-wing parties have formed a campaign alliance in West Bengal. In Kerala, the Congress Party faces strong opposition, and the Communist Party is campaigning alone here, while the People's Socialist Party has formed a campaign alliance with the Muslim League. In Bombay State, the question of forming a single-language state is the most acute issue in the campaign. Competing with the Congress Party is the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti. This association consists of: the Communist Party of India, the People's Socialist Party, the Peasants and Workers Party, a splinter group of the Congress Party, the Scheduled Castes Federation, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, and the Hindu Mahasabha. This association demands the establishment of the Maharashtra State, which the Indian government opposes. Similarly, in the Gujarati-speaking area of ​​Bombay State, the Congress Party is opposed by the Maha Gujarat Janata Parishad and the united front formed by various opposition parties, which demand the establishment of Gujarat State.

    印度各政党的竞选活动
    印度第二次大选将在本月下旬开始，各政党正在加紧进行竞选活动。
    印度选举委员会承认的全国性政党有国大党、印度共产党、人民社会党和印度人民同盟。按照规定，在上次大选中至少获得3％的选票的政党才能够被承认为全国性政党。除了四个全国性政党以外，参加竞选的还有一些比较小的党派。
    在即将举行的大选中，印度的两亿选民将选出五百名人民院议员，二千九百零六名邦立法会议议员（另有安得拉邦立法会议的一百九十六名议员已经在1955年选出）。据报纸消息，到1月29日为止，已经提出了大约一万五千个候选人的名单。竞选活动的情况表明：即将到来的大选将主要是国大党和左翼党派尤其是印度共产党之间的竞争。国大党的竞选宣传一开头就针对着印度共产党和人民社会党。尼赫鲁在竞选演说中一直激烈地攻击印度共产党的政策和马克思主义关于无产阶级专政的学说。到目前为止，国大党领袖的竞选演说的主要内容是强调印度外交政策、第一个五年计划的成就和第二个五年计划的执行、以及国大党竞选宣言中所提出的口号：“社会主义、民主和和平方法”。
    尼赫鲁2月3日晚在拉姆利拉广场的公众集会上开始了国大党在德里的竞选运动。他应国大党各邦委员会的要求在加尔各答、孟买、马德拉斯和阿兰迦巴等地作了竞选旅行。内政部长潘特、国大党主席德巴和其他国大党领袖也在活跃地从事竞选活动。印度报界指出，国大党组织正竭力利用尼赫鲁的个人声望来从事竞选运动。
    国大党募集了大量竞选基金。据“印度斯坦时报”说，国大党仅仅在宣传上就要花一百万卢比。国大党购买了一百多辆吉普车和一千六百个扩音机。它还在利用二千张留声机唱片，广告画，以及电影流动放映车和其他交通工具。人民社会党领袖说，国大党竞选基金大部分是由工业家和垄断资本家所提供的。人民社会党总书记特里洛基·辛格说，仅仅在北方邦，制糖工业家就已经捐款二百五十万卢比，康波尔的纺织和石油巨头也捐了二百五十万卢比给国大党作为竞选基金。阿索卡·梅达说，塔塔钢铁公司捐了二百万卢比作为国大党竞选基金。
    印度共产党也在加强它的竞选运动。共产党领袖阿约艾·高士和阿伊莱斯·库特尔·高普兰在全国各地作竞选旅行。印度共产党强调所有左翼和民主力量团结一致和组成强有力的民主反对派，以便结束国大党的垄断地位。它强烈抨击国大党在国内经济问题上的过错，揭露工人和农民的苦难、失业、苛捐杂税等现象。它主张打破英国资本对印度经济重要部门的控制，遏制垄断资本家。它要求给农民和农业劳工以土地。印度共产党要求印度脱离英联邦，并且和社会主义国家更紧密地合作。
    人民社会党在竞选纲领中批评国大党反对外国垄断资本不够彻底，并且要求退出英联邦。它主张把包括外国人所拥有的种植园在内的“一切基本工业”收归国有，但是付给充分的赔偿；把土地交给农民，同时给地主以补偿。它主张“经济分散化”，也就是说只发展手工业。它认为印度发展大工业是力难胜任的。
    印度人民同盟竭力想争取正统的印度教徒的选票。它提出了来自巴基斯坦的危险的口号，并且因而敦促加强防御。它主张在“消灭”巴基斯坦以后建立“统一的印度”。
    在1951年—1952年大选时，国大党得到全部国会选票的大约45％，但是却赢得了全部国会席位的74.43％。同样，在各邦立法会议的选举中，国大党获得了42.36％的选票，但是却获得了全部席位的68.56％。
    上次大选结果表明，印度共产党成了最大的反对党，它在人民院中拥有二十六个席位，在各邦立法会议中获有一百七十三个席位。
    国大党为了加强它在这次大选中获胜的机会，已经让阿克利党（旁遮普的锡克教族政党）参加它的队伍。因此，国大党在旁遮普邦的候选人中有几个就是阿克利党的党员。国大党还得到印度穆斯林学者协会和英印协会的支持。喀拉拉的基督教会和拉贾斯坦的大地主也是支持国大党的。
    印度共产党和人民社会党没有能够在全国范围组织联合阵线来参加这次大选。然而，这两个党和三个其他左翼政党在西孟加拉邦组成了竞选联盟。在喀拉拉，国大党面临强大的反对，共产党在这里单独竞选，人民社会党已经同穆斯林联盟成立竞选联盟。在孟买邦，成立单一的语言邦的问题是竞选中最尖锐的问题。同国大党竞选的有统一马哈拉施特拉协会。组成这个协会的有：印度共产党、人民社会党、农工党、国大党的分裂派、表列种姓联盟、印度人民同盟和印度教大会。这个协会要求成立为印度政府所反对的马哈拉施特拉邦。同样的，在孟买邦古吉拉特语地区，国大党受到大古吉拉特人民协会和各反对党组成的统一阵线的反对，它们要求成立古吉拉特邦。
