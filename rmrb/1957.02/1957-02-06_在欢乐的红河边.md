Double joy fell upon the banks of the Red River, one was the annual Spring Festival, and the other was an unprecedented get-together – the Spring Festival get-together of border people in Hekou Old Street. The double joy brought doubled happiness to the people on both sides of the Red River.

	Breaking Old Customs

In the welcoming crowd for the Old Street residents coming to Hekou for the get-together, there was a minority girl wearing brand-new green clothes. She was a very ordinary girl, but being able to stand here on this early morning of the third day of the Lunar New Year was no simple matter.

Her name is Wang Lianying. Her home is in Mane Village, Basha District, twenty-five li away from Hekou.

The minority people of Mane Village have an old custom: no one is willing to go out before the third day of the Lunar New Year. Even if you want to go out, your family won't agree; even if your family agrees, the villagers will gossip. In short, everyone can only stay at home, and no matter how big the matter is, it has to wait a few days.

When asked about the origin of this custom, it's just superstition, with legends saying that going out these days will encounter wandering, un-worshipped souls. After liberation, superstitious ideas have been greatly weakened, but this old custom remains.

Somehow, the news of this get-together made Wang Lianying's mother forget this custom. Just because she herself is the head of the agricultural cooperative. Spring production will begin soon, and she really couldn't leave, so she had to mobilize her daughter to go.

Wang Lianying was a little worried at first, but was finally persuaded by her mother. Before leaving, her mother also told her: "Go sing some folk songs, or just have a good look!"

So, on the third day of the Lunar New Year, Wang Lianying went to the district with the villagers and arrived in Hekou City. Now, she is wearing the new clothes her mother personally gave her, holding a small colored flag saying "Welcome Vietnamese Comrades" and standing in the welcoming crowd.

During this get-together, she indeed saw a lot of things, but didn't sing any folk songs. It's not that she didn't want to sing, but she really didn't have the opportunity to sing, because she didn't meet a suitable acquaintance. Being unfamiliar, she didn't dare to sing randomly – if the other party was engaged, it would cause trouble.

	The Awakened "Lion"

Hekou, known as a calm area, rarely had some wind in the afternoon, and it wasn't small. However, the tropical sun was still scorching, and even wearing only a single shirt, people were sweating profusely. So, people had to sit in the shade of the trees with regret. Only a large circle of people was still gathered at the edge of the square. They forgot the scorching sun, forgot everything, and stretched their necks to watch something intently inside the circle.

At this time, a lion in the circle was fast asleep – it was really too tired from performing. It wanted to sleep, but it couldn't sleep steadily, burying its head and twisting from side to side.

Suddenly, the drumbeats accelerated, and the lion woke up. It looked up, it jumped, as if it were not in the square, but in the wilderness.

This is a newly awakened lion. When the news of the Hekou Old Street border people's Spring Festival get-together spread, the residents of Hekou Chengguan Town racked their brains, and everyone was thinking about adding to the joy of the conference. Gong Chengkun, Zhao Rijiang and others remembered that in the past, they themselves loved to play with lions the most, and the people of Old Street loved to watch lions even more. The people of Old Street also had their own lions, but they still invited them to play every Spring Festival. The lions here and there are played a little differently, and there are also martial arts performances.

But this was many years ago. During the celebration of liberation, they played to their heart's content once, but later they were busy with production and never played again. They gathered their old partners from many years ago, redecorated the lion, practiced for three consecutive nights, and then this lion, which had been sleeping for six years, appeared in the square again as lively as a dragon and tiger.

	Easy to Meet, Hard to Part

As soon as people began to enter the venue, several comrades from Old Street came to the medical tent by the side of the venue. However, they were not patients, but asked to serve in the medical tent. This request was not granted because there were already enough medical personnel in the medical tent, but they still insisted on leaving two behind. Then everyone started talking, and when they learned that the people serving in the medical tent were comrades from the Hekou Health Center, they requested to visit the health center. This request was enthusiastically accepted, with the time set at 6:00 PM.

A moving scene appeared in the health center. What was held here was not a simple visit, but a small get-together. A total of thirty-four comrades from Old Street arrived one after another. Liu Yuedun, the director of the Old Street Provincial Hospital, said: We are really happy to participate in today's Spring Festival get-together, and we also have the opportunity to meet with the medical workers of Hekou. How is this possible without the leadership of the Communist Party and the Labor Party? Director Liu was very excited and had a lot to say, but the comrade who was temporarily acting as a translator only translated a few sentences. But what does that matter? Feelings do not necessarily have to be expressed through language.

Then another comrade stood up to speak. He said: I am a railway worker, I have nothing to say, I can only do my job well to repay the enthusiasm of the people of Hekou; to ensure smooth railway traffic. This comrade did not consider whether he was a medical worker, he rushed over as soon as he heard about such a meeting.

Speeches followed one after another. Later, everyone shouted slogans and solemnly raised their glasses to wish Chairman Mao and President Ho health. Everyone called this meal the unity meal, and while eating the unity meal, everyone sang unity songs.

In addition, everyone also introduced the incidence and prevention methods of various seasonal diseases in Hekou Old Street to each other, and did not go to see the entertainment performance until after 8:00 PM.

The next evening, Director Liu brought another group of medical workers. They were taking turns to participate in the get-together. Because the meeting on the first day was too long and delayed their watching the movie, Comrade Cheng Baogui, the director of the Hekou Health Center, tried his best to end it earlier this time. But how much did everyone have to say! How could they finish it all at once? They simply didn't want to leave.

It was really late, so everyone had to shake hands and say goodbye. The comrades of the health center habitually said: "See you tomorrow!" The comrades from Old Street said: "We can't see you tomorrow!" They embraced, one hugging another, and Director Cheng of the Health Center was hugged all the way to the street by them. So everyone went to see the play together, and it was not until late at night that everyone said goodbye at the Viet Bridgehead, and these friends from Old Street were still waving their hands for a long, long time when they reached the bridgehead on the other side.

    在欢乐的红河边
      本报记者　章皆淳
    双重喜事落在红河畔，一件是一年一度的春节，一件是前所未有的联欢大会——河口老街边境人民春节联欢大会。双重的喜事，给红河两岸的人民带来了加倍的欢乐。
        打破老惯例
    在欢迎老街边民来河口联欢的队伍中，有一个穿着崭新的绿色衣服的少数民族姑娘，她是一个非常普通的姑娘，可是在这大年初三的大清早能站在这里就不是简单的了。
    她的名字叫王莲英。家在坝洒区曼峨村。离河口有二十五里远。
    曼峨村的少数民族有这样一个老习惯，就是正月不过初三是谁也不肯出门的。就是你愿出去，家里的人也不答应；即使家里的人答应了，村里的人也会说长道短的。总之，谁也只能在家里呆着，有多大的事也只好过几天再说。
    追问起这习惯的来因，只不过是迷信，传说这几天出去会碰到无祀孤魂。解放以后，迷信观念虽已大大地减弱了。但这个老习惯却依旧保持着。
    不知怎样，这次联欢的消息，竟使王莲英的母亲忘了这个习惯。只因为她自己是农业社社长。不久就要开始春季生产了，实在走不开，于是只好动员她闺女去。
    王莲英开始也有些顾虑，但终于被她母亲说服了。临走她母亲还嘱咐说：“去唱唱山歌，不然就好好地看看吧！”
    于是王莲英就在初三那天和村里的人一块到区上会齐，来到了河口城里。现在，她已穿着她母亲亲手交给她的新衣服，拿着“欢迎越南同志”的小彩旗站在欢迎队伍中了。
    在这联欢的日子里，她确实看了不少东西，只是没有唱山歌。这不是她不肯唱，实在是没机会唱，因为她没有遇到合适的熟人。陌生的她可不敢乱唱——如果对方已订了婚，那是要闹乱子的。
      醒来的“狮子”
    被称为静风地带的河口，难得下午竟起了些风，而且不算小。不过热带的太阳究竟是炎热的，就是只穿单衫，还是被晒得汗流浃背。于是，人们只好遗憾地坐到树荫下面去。只有广场的边上还围着一大圈人。他们忘了烈日的烤晒，忘了一切，一个个伸着脖子目不转睛地看着圈内的什么东西。
    这时圈内有一只狮子正在沉沉欲睡——它是实在戏耍得太倦了。它想睡，可总是睡不稳，把头埋下，又东扭西歪的。
    突然，鼓点加急了节奏，狮子醒来了。它昂视，它奔跳，仿佛不是在广场中，而是在原野上。
    这是一只刚醒来的狮子。当河口老街的边境人民春节联欢的消息传开后，河口城关镇的居民们就在搜索枯肠，大家都在为增加大会的欢乐而思索着。龚承焜、赵日江等想起了，在过去，他们自己就最爱耍狮子，而老街的人们更是爱看狮子。老街的人们也有他们自己的狮子，但还是每年春节都请他们过去耍。这边的狮子和那边是耍得不大一样的，而且还有武术表演。
    不过这已是多年以前的事了，在庆祝解放时，还尽情地耍了一次，后来因忙着搞生产就再没耍了。他们召集起多年前的老伙伴，重新修饰好狮子，一连练了三个晚上，于是这只睡了六年的狮子又生龙活虎一样地在广场上出现了。
    见时容易别时难
      人们刚开始入场，会场边的医疗棚前就来了好几个老街来的同志。不过他们并不是病人，而是要求到医疗棚里服务地。这请求没有被答应，因为医疗棚内已有足够的医疗人员，但他们还是硬留下两个。接着大家就交谈起来，当他们知道在医疗棚服务的是河口卫生院的同志时，就要求到卫生院参观。这请求被热情地接受了，时间约在晚上六时。
    动人的场面在卫生院内出现了，在这里举行的不是简单的参观，而是一个小型的联欢会。陆续来到的老街同志一共有三十四位。老街省医院院长刘越盾说：我们参加了今天这样的春节联欢大会，心里真是高兴，而且又有机会能和河口的医务工作同志见面，不是在共产党、劳动党领导下哪有可能。刘院长很激动，话也很多，可是临时充当翻译的同志，却只翻了这么几句。但这又有多大关系？感情是不一定要通过语言的。
    接着又一个同志站起来发言，他说：我是个铁路工人，我没有什么说的，我只有做好工作来回答河口人民的热情；保证铁路畅通。这位同志并没有考虑自己是不是医务人员，他一听到有这么一个会见就赶着来了。
    发言一个接着一个，后来大家高呼口号，并庄严地举起酒杯祝毛主席、胡主席健康。大家把这饭叫做团结饭，在吃团结饭中大家又唱起团结歌。
    此外，大家还相互介绍了河口老街各季节的发病情况及预防办法，一直到八时多才去看文娱演出。
    第二天的晚上，刘院长又带着另一批医务工作同志来了，他们是轮班来参加联欢的。第一天的会见因为拖得太长了，耽误了他们看电影，这次河口卫生院院长程宝贵同志就尽量想法提早结束。但大家的心里有多少话要说啊！一下子怎么讲得完呢？他们简直就不想走。
    时间实在是迟了，大家只好握手告别，卫生院的同志习惯地说：“明天见！”老街的同志说：“明天见不了啦！”他们拥抱了，一个抱着一个，卫生院程院长一直被他们抱到街上。于是大家又一道去看戏，一直到深夜大家才在越桥头告别，而这些老街的友人，直到那边桥头了，还在长久长久地挥着手。
