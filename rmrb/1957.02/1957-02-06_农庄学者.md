	My method cannot become a new dogma.
	We must strive for harvests from nature, not wait for nature's bounty!
					— T.S. Maltsev

	The fields of the Urals have their unique and captivating charm. The dense birch forests present a magnificent scene rarely seen even in watercolor paintings. The slender pine forests, with their dense branches like millions of open umbrellas, seem to shield even the high sky. Terenty Semyonovich Maltsev accompanied us to the fields of the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm.
	Maltsev and I were in a car. Had no one told me beforehand, I would never have believed that he was already sixty-one years old. When he spoke, he liked to wave his strong hands. He looked as if he had just returned from the fields; he was wearing a dark green military uniform top, and like a soldier, he had a wide leather belt around his waist, full of energy. He must have been working in the fields just now, because he hadn't even had time to wipe off the mud on his coat, and the edges of his shoes were still covered with moist black soil. In his hand he held a small iron stick as thick as a little finger, like a small walking stick, probably because he often dealt with the soil, so it was bright and shiny, gleaming with a black light. I thought: this is the honorary academician of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the famous farm scholar, whom I came to visit specifically; it was he who, based on his specific circumstances, independently thought and overturned the conclusions of contemporary authoritative scientists; it was he who made the land serve him and created a new cultivation method, achieving high yields in many places throughout the Soviet Union. But he is such a simple person!
	The car stopped beside a field of wheat, hundreds of hectares connected together. The air was filled with the fragrance of ripe wheat, the heavy, full ears standing upright in high spirits. Maltsev pointed to a field of wheat and said, "This is our 'Lyuteschenskaya 758' wheat variety."
	I had heard of this "Lyuteschenskaya 758" wheat variety long ago. I knew that it was a good seed that Maltsev had started cultivating as early as twenty-two years ago to suit the needs of his own collective farm. It was transplanted from the Saratov Specialized School. At that time, no one could conquer the capricious and annoying climate of the Shadrinsk region. In June, the dry winds blowing from the Kazakh steppes made it difficult to see even clouds in the sky, and severe drought threatened the newly growing crops; but in July, continuous rainy seasons often caused waterlogging disasters in the fields; and just as September began, the frost period arrived early. Maltsev, who had never even attended school for a day, had read many books through his own hard work. He thought: if only we could have a panacea seed. When there is severe drought in June, it grows slowly and can withstand drought; and in July, it can rely on rainwater to grow quickly; and before the frost period arrives, the wheat has already matured early.
	Maltsev found all kinds of seeds and, in the first agricultural team he led, tried planting more than four hundred kinds of spring wheat. Some were early-maturing, some were late-maturing; some liked moisture, some were not afraid of cold; some had red grains, some had white grains. After a long period of breeding and cultivation, he finally found seeds suitable for his hometown's land and climate. "Lyuteschenskaya 758" was one of them.
	On this boundless wheat field, I saw combine harvesters skillfully harvesting the wheat. Piles of wheat straw that had already been harvested were discharged from behind the combine harvester; uniform grains of wheat fell like raindrops into a large box above the machine. This scene of harvest made me recall some things I had been told about Maltsev in Moscow, about some things that had happened in his quest for harvest.
	In the past, there was a period when the sowing time was often uniformly stipulated by the calendar of the superior office. Regardless of whether spring came early or late; regardless of whether there was more or less moisture in the ground, an order came down, and sowing had to be carried out without exception. At that time, Maltsev had already cultivated seeds suitable for his own land and climate, but in his work, he increasingly painfully felt that if he did not follow the laws of natural development and did not cooperate closely with nature, it would still be impossible to guarantee high yields every year. In his view, in the land of the Shadrinsk region, if the sowing time could be delayed a little, the moist land could still guarantee the growth of wheat seedlings, and when severe drought arrived, it would be precisely when the drought resistance of the wheat had already been enhanced. July is the rainy season, which is precisely when the wheat needs water for filling; and early sowing is detrimental to the growth of wheat. Based on his cultivation experience, he determined that if the sowing time could be delayed a little, it would definitely be beneficial to the growth of crops.
	One spring, an order came from above, stipulating that the sowing work in the entire state had to be completed on May 20th. But in the fields of the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm, at this time, the thick snow had just melted, and the soil moisture was still too much. Maltsev explained the situation in the fields to everyone and discussed with the villagers to decide to postpone the sowing until the 25th to complete it.
	The fact that Maltsev did not sow on schedule was known to the State Committee. The State Committee Secretary summoned him to Kurgan and instructed him: "You are not yet a perfect person, why are you so confident in yourself?"
	"Comrade Secretary, there is no perfect person in the world. Our sowing is not for reporting, it is for the autumn harvest." Maltsev replied: "As for when it is best to sow, in my opinion, it is difficult for anyone to know more than the villagers. You should trust the villagers, they only want the country to be happy, they are loyal people!"
	"You are not yet a Socialist Labor Hero, you are just an ordinary person, it is almost enough if you can manage yourself well."
	"I cannot agree with your opinion." Maltsev said firmly: "My purpose is not for honor. The villagers elected me, I cannot leave the position given to me by everyone!" From then on, the differences became greater and greater.
	A few days later, a reporter from the state newspaper "Red Kurgan" came. He stayed in the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm for a day and a night and saw that by June 8th, this collective farm had only completed 5% of the total sowing. He went back and wrote an article, the main idea of which was: the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm has four crawler-type seeders, one hundred head of livestock, and nearly four hundred laborers; but now they are still sleeping. This caused quite a stir, and the District Committee immediately issued an order, instructing that sowing must be completed within the time limit, and anyone who violates this order will be imprisoned.
	There was no way, everything still had to be done in accordance with the regulations of the superiors. Maltsev and the villagers finished sowing their land with painful hearts. But they were not willing to give up. Two weeks later, oat grass had already grown in the fields together with the sown spring wheat. In order to test whether his theory of delaying the sowing time was correct, he plowed up all the crops and weeds that had been sown not long ago on two hundred and forty hectares of land and resowed wheat for the second time.
	In those days, a great sense of responsibility made him restless day and night. He knew how heavy his burden was. Under these circumstances, even the slightest mistake would affect the harvest in the fields, affect the state's plan for purchasing grain, and affect whether the villagers had food to eat. That year, the climate was particularly dry. There were fifty days without rain in June and July. The ground cracked. The spring wheat and weeds that had been sown early were sparse, thin, and short, growing together, and had long withered and turned yellow. But the two hundred and forty hectares of land that had been sown later had green wheat growing on them, which was full and strong. Because it had been plowed again, all the weeds had been cleared. At harvest time, the early-sown land yielded only twenty-four poods of grain per hectare, while the late-sown land yielded one hundred and fourteen poods of grain per hectare. Maltsev, proceeding from the conditions of the natural world, not acting according to mechanical regulations, and slightly postponing the sowing time, harvested nearly four times more grain.
	After this incident, the higher leading organs made a special decision. This decision allowed Maltsev to cultivate his land freely according to his own needs, and no one was allowed to interfere with him.
	When we casually asked Maltsev about this matter, Maltsev replied with a smile: "Every spring they criticize me, but at harvest time they praise me. In those years, it simply became a habit."
	After we had seen the harvesting of the bountiful crops, Maltsev then led us to visit the new cultivation method of the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm. The car stopped on a piece of land where a tractor was plowing. Maltsev told us: "This land is deep-plowed only once every five years, and in the other four years, it is only shallow-plowed once a year." What we are seeing now is the land that is due for deep plowing this year. We saw a tractor pulling a plow without a moldboard to cultivate the land. It plowed very deeply. When we walked behind it, our shoes were almost stuck in the mud. Although the soil was very loose, it was not turned over at all. Maltsev squatted down, and without any effort, he inserted the small iron stick in his hand into the ground, then pulled it out. When we all looked at it, we knew that the ground had been plowed to a depth of about fifty-five centimeters. We also stopped on the land that was only shallow-plowed. This shallow plowing was only twelve centimeters deep. The tractor was pulling a specially made shallow plowing machine to work. In one pass, a strip of land sixteen meters and sixty centimeters wide was shallowly plowed. The surface soil had been completely loosened, and the wheat roots had been turned over and pressed into the soil, while the land below that had not been deep-plowed was as hard as a stone slab.
	We listened to Maltsev telling us about the process of creating the new cultivation method. As he spoke to us, he introduced us to the actual situation in the fields.
	"Our agricultural production, for a long period of time, universally promoted the grass-arable crop rotation method created by the famous agronomist Williams. Because before this, many great agricultural scientists believed that planting annual plants such as rice, millet, and wheat would only make the land increasingly barren. But the contemporary Soviet authoritative agronomist Williams refuted this claim. He believed that the grass-arable crop rotation method of planting perennial grasses could restore soil fertility. So the grass-arable crop rotation method became a cultivation method that was universally promoted at that time. On many lands, instead of planting annual plants such as grains and miscellaneous grains, only clover, timothy grass, and other perennial plants were planted. Williams's view seemed to be an absolutely correct conclusion. For more than ten years, no one dared to doubt him. People felt that this was already an indisputable principle of agricultural science.
	"Our 'Lenin's Legacy' Collective Farm of course also adopted the grass-arable crop rotation method. However, on the land planted with perennial grasses, some lands could only harvest three quintals of dry grass per hectare. In the thirteen years, our average grain harvest per hectare was only eleven point two quintals. And this seemed to have reached a saturation point. It seemed impossible to harvest more yields.
	"The facts made me begin to doubt Williams's theory. I thought: planting perennial grasses may be suitable in other places; but it is not suitable here. I had many questions in my heart: why can so much land only grow grass and not grain? Besides perennial grasses, can crops also allow the land to restore fertility? ...
	"Our cultivation method mainly proves that planting crops can also give fertility to the land, and the higher the yield, the more fertile the soil is. The question is whether you can utilize the laws of natural development. Comparing the situation in 1911 and 1953 can make it clear. The summers in both years were particularly dry. During the growing season of the crops, there was only about forty-eight millimeters of rainfall. In 1911, the farmers did not even recover the seeds; but in 1953, we harvested eighteen quintals of grain per hectare."
	Maltsev bent down and pulled up a handful of wheat. This wheat was growing on a piece of land that had been shallow-plowed for four years. The grains of wheat were very full. When placed in the palm of your hand, they were really like beads. Its fine roots did not grow deep, but were intricately propagated on the surface layer of the soil. Maltsev used his hand to pull open those shallow-plowed soils in a small area, and then used his small stick to insert it and laboriously dug out a piece of the soil below. Before our eyes, these two kinds of soil clearly had two different colors. The surface layer was black and rich in nutrients; the lower layer was yellow, which was barren soil. Maltsev told us: In the past, the land we deep-plowed often turned the upper layer of soil with nutrients to the bottom, and turned the lower layer of barren soil to the top, but when we deep-plow now, the soil on the top is still on the top, and the soil on the bottom is still on the bottom. Because it is precisely this surface soil that is the richest kitchen for giving nutrition to plants.
	The next day, before leaving the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm, we went to Maltsev's home to say goodbye. It was a genuine peasant's home. Walking into the wooden fence, there were two large white pigs sunbathing in the yard, and a group of white-haired, red-crested chickens were actively competing for food. The house he lived in was the same as the houses of ordinary villagers in this area. Even the walls were made of wood. In his not very spacious room, we saw that the windowsills, tables, and his two bookcases were all filled with books, some of which were books in different languages ​​that described his deeds. The iron stick like a small walking stick leaned against the corner of the wall. His light yellow coat hung on the hanger. The moist soil on the coat had not yet dried, and his shoes were still covered with mud. He forcefully extended a hand to me. I saw that his hand still had traces of the soil of the Urals. I thought: he must have just returned from the fields, what an ordinary person! A person who has tamed the earth! (Attached image)

    我的方法不能变成新的教条。
    我们要向自然争取丰收，而不是等待自然的赐予！
                                ——捷·谢·马尔采夫
    乌拉尔的田野有她独特的迷人的魅力。密密的白桦林呈现着在水彩画里也难常见的那种瑰丽的景致。瘦削的松树林，浓密的枝叶像千万把张开的大伞，它好像把高高的天空都遮掩起来了。捷连季·谢苗诺维奇·马尔采夫陪着我们到“列宁遗训”集体农庄的田间去。
    马尔采夫和我坐在一辆汽车里，要是没有人预先告诉过我，我无论如何也不会相信他已经有六十一岁的年纪了。他说起话来，喜欢挥动自己有力的手。看样子他是刚从田间回来不久，他穿着深绿色的军服上身，腰际还像军人那样系着一根宽皮带，精神旺盛。一定是方才还在地里工作过，所以连大衣上的烂泥还没有来得及擦去，鞋子的四边还沾着湿润的黑土。他手里拿着一根有小手指那样粗的小铁棍，像根小手杖那样，可能是由于常常和泥土打交道，所以澄亮澄亮的，闪着乌黑的光。我想：他就是我特地要来访问的苏联农业科学院的荣誉院士、有名的农庄学者，是他根据自己的具体情况独立思考，推翻了当代权威的科学家的论断；是他使大地为自己服务，创造了新耕作法，在全苏联很多地方取得了高额的产量。但他却是一个多么质朴的人啊！
    汽车在成百公顷连在一起的麦地边上停了下来。空气里充满了成熟的麦子所散发的清香，沉甸甸的饱满的麦穗精神抖擞地挺立着。马尔采夫指着一片麦地说：“这就是我们的‘留捷斯琴斯七五八号’麦种”。
    我早就听说过这“留捷斯琴斯七五八号”麦种了。我知道它是马尔采夫早在二十二年以前开始培育的适合自己农庄所需要的一种好种子，它是从萨拉托夫专科学校移植来的。那时候，还没有任何人可以征服这谢德林斯克区变化多端的恼人的气候。这一带在6月份，从哈萨克斯坦草原刮过来的干燥的风，使天上连云彩也很难看到，苦旱威胁着刚刚生长的庄稼；但一到7月份，连绵的雨季常常使地里的庄稼涝害成灾；9月刚刚开始，霜冻期就提前来到了。原来一天学校也没有上过的马尔采夫，依靠自己的苦学，这时已经阅读过很多书籍。他想：我们如果能够有一种万能的种子就好了。当6月苦旱的时候，它长得慢，能耐旱；而在7月的时候能依靠雨水很快地生长；不等霜降期来到，麦子却已经提早成熟了。
    马尔采夫找到了各式各样的种子，在最初领导的农业小组里，试种了四百多种春小麦。有的是早熟的，有的是晚熟的；有的是喜欢湿润的，有的是不怕寒的；有的是红颗粒的，有的是白颗粒的。经过了长久的繁殖和培育，终于寻到了适合自己的家乡的土地和气候的种子，“留捷斯琴斯七五八号”就是其中的一种。
    在这无边无际的麦田上，我看到联合收割机正在轻巧地收割麦子。一堆一堆已经割完麦穗的麦秸从联合收割机的身后放下来；均匀的麦粒像雨点般地撒落到机器上面的一个大箱子里去。这丰收的情景使我想起在莫斯科的时候，有人曾经告诉过我的关于马尔采夫为了争取丰收曾发生过的一些事情。
    在过去的岁月里，有一个时期，播种的时间常常是由上级办公室的日历上统一规定的。不管是春天来得早，还是来得晚；不管地里的水分是多还是少，一道命令，播种就得毫无例外地进行。当时，马尔采夫已经培育了适合自己的土地和气候的种子，但在工作中却越来越痛苦地感觉到如果不管自然发展的规律，不和自然亲密地合作，要想保证年年达到高额的产量，这仍然是不可能的。据他看来，在谢德林斯克区的土地上，如果推迟一些播种的时间，湿润的土地仍旧可以保证使麦芽成长，而在苦旱到来的时候，也恰是麦子的抗旱性已经增强了。7月份是雨季，那正是麦子灌浆需要水分的时候；而早播种，对于麦子的成长是不利的。他根据自己耕作的经验，断定如果能够把播种的时间推迟一些，这对于农作物的成长一定是有好处的。
    有一年的春天，上级来了一道命令，限定全州的播种工作要在5月20日那天完成。但在“列宁遗训”集体农庄的地里，这时厚厚的积雪刚刚化完，土地的水分还太多，马尔采夫向大家解释了地里的情形，和庄员们商量决定把播种延至25日完成。
    马尔采夫不按期播种的事被州委会知道了。州委书记把他叫到了库尔干训示他说：“你现在还不是一个完善的人，你为什么那样相信你自己？”
    “书记同志，世界上还没有十全十美的人。我们的播种不是为了汇报，是为了秋天的丰收。”马尔采夫回答说：“关于什么时候播种最好，据我看来谁也很难比庄员们知道得更多。你应当相信庄员们，他们只愿国家幸福，这是忠实的人们！”
    “你还不是社会主义劳动英雄，你不过是一个普通的人，你能够管好你自己就差不多了。”
    “我不能同意你的意见。”马尔采夫坚定地说：“我的目的并不是为了荣誉。庄员们选了我，我不能离开大家给我的岗位！”从此，分歧就越来越大了。
    几天以后，州的机关报“红色库尔干”来了一个记者。他在“列宁遗训”集体农庄逗留了一昼夜，看到这个农庄到6月8日为止，才完成了全部播种的5％。他回去写了一篇文章，文章的大意说：“列宁遗训”集体农庄，有四个履带式播种机、一百头牲畜和将近四百个劳动力；但现在他们还在睡觉。这一下可热闹了，区委会马上来了命令，指示必须在限期内播种完毕，谁要违反这个命令，就要被关进监狱。
    没有办法，一切还得遵照上级的规定办事，马尔采夫和庄员们带着痛苦的心情种完了自己的土地。但是他们并不甘心，两个星期以后，燕麦草已经和播种的春小麦一起在地里长出来了，为了试验自己延迟播种时间的论断是否正确，他在二百四十公顷的土地上把不久之前种下的庄稼和杂草全部犁去，重新第二次种上了小麦。
    在那些日子里，重大的责任感使他日夜不安。他知道自己的担子是多么重大，在这种情况下面，哪怕是发生一些极其微小的错误，也会影响到地里的收成，影响到国家收购粮食的计划和庄员们有没有饭吃。这一年，恰恰气候异常干旱，6、7月份有五十天没有下雨，地里裂了缝，早种的春小麦和杂草，稀稀拉拉，又瘦又短，长在一起，早已枯黄了。但那后种的二百四十公顷土地上却长着绿油油的麦子，又丰满，又茁壮。因为重新犁过一次，杂草也全被清除了。到秋收的时候，先种的每公顷只收了二十四普特粮食，后种的每公顷收了一百十四普特粮食。马尔采夫根据自然界的情况出发，不按照机械的规定办事，把播种的时间稍许向后推移了一些，就多收了将近四倍的粮食。
    在这件事情发生以后，上级领导机关专门作过一个决定。这个决定允许马尔采夫能够根据自己的需要自由地耕种自己的土地，谁也不准干涉他。
    我们顺便问起马尔采夫这件事情的时候，马尔采夫笑着回答说：“每年春天批评我，而到秋收的时候却表扬我。那几年，简直是成为习惯了。”
    我们看过了正在收割的丰收的庄稼，马尔采夫接着领我们去参观“列宁遗训”集体农庄的新耕作法。汽车在一块拖拉机正在犁地的土地上停了下来。马尔采夫告诉我们：“这里的土地，每五年只深耕一次，其他的四年每年只进行一次浅耕。”我们现在见到的是今年轮到深耕的土地，只见拖拉机牵引着一种没有犁壁的犁在耕地，它耕得很深，我们在后边走过去，鞋子险些儿被陷在泥土里。泥土虽然十分松软，但根本没有翻过来。马尔采夫蹲下去，他并不费力地用手里的那根小铁棍插下地去，然后拔出来，我们大家一看，知道这地耕得大约有五十五公分深。我们也在只进行浅耕的土地上停留过，这种浅耕只有十二公分深，拖拉机拉着一种特殊制造的浅耕机在工作，它一次走过，就有十六公尺六十公分宽的地方浅浅地被犁过，表层的土壤已经完全松碎，麦根都被翻转身来压在土壤里，而下面未曾深耕的土地却坚硬得如同石板。
    我们倾听着马尔采夫向我们叙述的新耕作法的创造的经过。他一面给我们讲，一面把田间的实际情形介绍给我们。
    “我们的农业生产，有一个较长的时期曾经普遍地推广过著名的农学家威廉斯创造的草田轮作法。因为在这以前，有很多大农业科学家们都认为种植像稻、谷、小麦之类的一年生植物，土地只会越种越贫瘠。而当代的苏维埃权威农学家威廉斯反驳了这种说法，他认为种植多年草的草田轮作法可以使土壤恢复肥力。于是草田轮作法当时成了被普遍推广的耕作方法。在很多土地上，不种五谷杂粮一年生植物，只种三叶草、猫尾草以及其他多年生植物。威廉斯的见解仿佛是一种绝对正确的定论，十几年以来，没有人敢怀疑他，人们觉得这已经是无可争辩的农业科学的原理了。
    “我们‘列宁遗训’集体农庄当然也采用了草田轮作法。可是，在种植多年草的土地上，有的每公顷土地只能收三公担干草。在十三年的时间里，我们每公顷土地的食粮收获量平均仅仅是十一点二公担。而这好像已经到了饱和点，要想收获更多的产量似乎是不可能的了。
    “事实使我开始怀疑威廉斯的论断。我想：种多年草在别的地方也许是适合的；而在我们这里是不适合的。我的心里有很多问题：为什么那样多的土地只能长草而不能长粮食？除了多年草，是不是也可以让农作物给土地恢复肥力？……
    “我们的耕作法主要是证明了种植农作物也能给予土地肥力，而且是产量越高，土壤的肥力越足。问题是在于你会不会利用自然发展的规律。拿1911年和1953年的情形作比较就可以明白，这两年的夏季特别干旱，在农作物生长期间，一共只降雨四十八毫米左右。在1911年，农民连种子也没有收回来；但在1953年，我们每公顷土地收获了十八公担粮食。
    马尔采夫弯下腰去拔起一把麦子，这麦子是生长在一块已经浅耕了四年的土地上的。麦粒长得很饱满，放在手心里，真像一粒一粒珠子一样。它的细密的根长得并不深，只是错综地繁殖在土壤的表层上。马尔采夫在一小块地方用手扒开了那些经过浅耕的土壤，然后用他那根小棍插下去，费力地掘出一块下面的土壤来。在我们眼前这两种土壤显然地有着两种不同的颜色，表层的是黑色的，富有养分；下边的是黄色的，那是贫瘠的土壤。马尔采夫告诉我们说：过去我们深耕过的土地，常常把上层有养分的土壤翻到下面去，而把下面贫瘠的土壤翻到上面来，而我们现在深耕的时候，上头的土还在上头，下头的土还在下头。因为正是这表面的土壤，才是给予植物营养的最丰富的厨房。
    第二天，在离开“列宁遗训”集体农庄之前，我们到马尔采夫的家里去告别。那是一个道地的农民的家，走进木板制成的围墙，院子里头有两口大白猪在晒太阳，一群白毛红冠的鸡在活跃地争食。他住的房子和这一带普通的庄员们住的房子一样，连墙壁也是木头做成的。在他的并不宽敞的房间里，只见窗台上、桌子上和他的两个书柜里头，到处都摆满了书籍，其中有一部分是叙述他的事迹的各国不同的版本的书籍。那根像小手杖似的铁棍靠在墙角里，他的那件浅黄色的大衣挂在衣架上，大衣上润湿的泥土还没有干，他的鞋子上还沾着烂泥。他用力地伸给我一只手，我看到他的手上还留有乌拉尔的泥土的痕迹。我想：他大约又是刚从田间回来，一个多么平凡的人！一个使大地都驯服的人啊！（附图片）
