Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 21st: According to the "Soviet Russia" newspaper, Chinese oil workers interning at the Grozny oil industrial enterprise in the Russian Federation recently learned by chance that in a collective farm near Grozny lives a Shandong man named Chayanchi (transliteration) - a participant in the Soviet Civil War and a famous fighter in the Budyonny's army. The Chinese oil workers sought out Chayanchi and invited him to visit them.

In the residence of the Chinese interns, the young Chinese oil workers had an interesting conversation with the gray-haired old man. The old man, who had participated in the battles to defend the Soviet regime in the Soviet Union, spoke about his experiences. He was the son of a farmhand, and from a young age, he was forced to leave his hometown due to poverty. He walked thousands of miles to Harbin, where he was recruited by Russian forestry capitalists and came to Tsarist Russia with some of his compatriots to work as coolies. During the October Revolution in 1917, Chayanchi and his companions were in Kishinev, Moldavia. The long-suffering Chinese working brothers were sincerely delighted by the victory of the Russian proletariat. Therefore, when the local People's Committee called on the people to participate in the struggle against the counter-revolution, Chayanchi and his fellow countrymen also decided to fight to defend the Soviet regime. They volunteered to join the Fourth Dnepr Revolutionary Regiment and were soon sent to Ukraine to fight against the White bandits.

In those fighting years, this young Chinese volunteer fought alongside the combat troops! In August 1918, a company of Chinese volunteers, including Chayanchi, broke through the encirclement of the White bandits after a battle to assist the working brothers who were bravely defending the city of Grozny. They tenaciously defended the freedom of Shibelnikovka. Many of Chayanchi's fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in this battle with unequal forces, and their blood flowed together with the blood of Russian soldiers.

After the end of the Soviet Civil War, Chayanchi came to Vladikavkaz. Here, he volunteered to join the ranks of the Cheka (肃反委员会) and fought against the remaining counter-revolutionary bandits. Later, he fell in love with a Russian girl, Cheenaida Mikhalskaya, and married her. Thirty-five years later, to Chayanchi's surprise, he met a group of young people from his homeland in Grozny and had this interesting and moving conversation with them.

In the conversation, Chayanchi said that he regretted not having seen Lenin, but he had not only met but also talked with Kirov, Voroshilov, and Budyonny, as intimately as he was talking with his fellow countrymen now.

When talking about the construction of New China, two young men from Shandong Province among the Chinese interns told Chayanchi many stories about the construction of his hometown. After hearing this, Chayanchi said with emotion and excitement, "Everything has changed, how quickly everything has changed!"

"Comrade Chayanchi, you know," a young technician interjected, "we must thank you for all of this, thank you and all those who defended the achievements of the October Revolution!" (Picture attached)

    有趣的会见
    访问参加过保卫十月革命成果的战斗的中国老工人
    新华社莫斯科21日电　据“苏维埃俄罗斯报”报道：在俄罗斯联邦格罗兹尼石油工业企业中实习的中国石油工人最近意外地知道了，在格罗兹尼附近的一个集体农庄住着一位叫查扬奇（译音）的山东人——一个苏联国内战争的参加者、有名的布琼尼部队的战士。中国石油工人寻访到了查扬奇，并且邀请他到他们那里去作客。
    在中国实习生居住的房舍里，年青的中国石油工人和这位两鬓灰白的老人进行了有趣的谈话。这位在苏联参加了保卫苏维埃政权的战斗的老人谈到了自己的经历。他是一个雇农的儿子，从青年时代起就因为家中穷困被迫离开了老家，徒步几千里到了哈尔滨，并且在那里受到俄国林业资本家的招募和一些同胞一同来到当时的沙皇俄国做苦工。1917年十月革命的时候，查扬奇和他的同伴正在摩尔达维亚的基什纽。饱经苦难的中国劳苦弟兄对俄国无产阶级的胜利从心眼里感到高兴。因此，在当地人民委员会号召人民参加反对反革命的斗争时，查扬奇和他的同乡也决定为保卫苏维埃政权而战斗。他们志愿加入了第聂伯第四革命团，而且很快就开往乌克兰同白匪作战去了。
    在那战斗的年代里，这位年轻的中国志愿兵随着战斗部队转战奋斗！1918年8月，包括查扬奇在内的一连中国志愿兵经过战斗，突破白匪的包围，去援助英勇地保卫着格罗兹尼城的工人弟兄。他们顽强地捍卫了希别利诺夫卡的自由，查扬奇的不少同乡在这场力量悬殊的战斗中牺牲了，他们的血同俄国战士的血流在一起。
    苏联国内战争结束以后，查扬奇来到夫拉季卡夫卡斯。他在这里又自愿参加了肃反委员会的队伍，同残余的反革命匪徒作斗争。后来，他爱上了一个俄国姑娘契娜伊达·米哈尔斯卡娅，并且同她结了婚。又过了三十五年，出乎查扬奇的意料，他在格罗兹尼会晤了一批来自他的祖国的青年，并且同他们进行了这场有趣的、动人的谈话。
    查扬奇在谈话中说，他可惜没有看见过列宁，但是和基洛夫、伏罗希洛夫和布琼尼不仅相见过，而且还谈过话，正像现在和同乡们谈话一样亲切。
    在谈到新中国的建设时，中国实习生当中的两个来自山东省的青年给查扬奇讲了许多关于他的故乡的建设情况和有趣的故事。听到这些以后，查扬奇感慨而兴奋地说：“全都变了，一切变化的多快啊！”
    “查扬奇同志，您知道，”一位青年技师插嘴说，“对于这一切，我们要感谢您，感谢您和所有保卫十月革命成果的人们！”（附图片）
