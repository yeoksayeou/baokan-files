    Nanchang Power Plant Neglects Political Work
    Seven Power Outages in Three Months

    (Our Dispatch) In the past three months, the Nanchang Power Plant has experienced seven power outages of varying degrees, causing significant losses to the city's industrial production and the people's livelihoods.

    The Party Committee of the plant conducted a comprehensive inspection and analysis of the outages. It concluded that, in addition to some reasons related to regulations and technology, the neglect of ideological and political work was the main reason for the continuous occurrence of accidents. From the nature of the accidents, most of them were due to human error. For example, before the accident on November 3, 1956, the on-duty operators became lax because of the low load. The stoker went upstairs to "chip slag," and the assistant stoker asked someone else to operate for him while he went to eat. Even the on-duty fitter was not in front of the furnace. As a result, when the machine malfunctioned, everyone rushed over but could not figure out the situation. Therefore, errors occurred in the judgment and handling of the accident, resulting in a forced shutdown and power outage. The accident did not receive enough attention from the leadership, and then on November 26, another accident occurred due to improper dispatching. The boiler shift leader did not make thorough arrangements for the entire plant's work. Seriously, the worker handover system was sloppy, leading to the accident. Even when the accident occurred, the driver of machine number × did not know the machine's operating mode at the time. As a result, the power outage lasted for more than eight hours. At that time, the plant leadership launched a major inspection of safety regulations, but it was not thorough enough, and accidents continued to occur. On January 15, a young worker at the Qilijie branch made a mistake in switching during a switch flash test, causing a shutdown and power outage, which caused many factories to stop production due to the sudden interruption of power. On February 1, just as people were celebrating the Spring Festival, another citywide power outage occurred because the on-duty personnel did not have a sufficient grasp of the accident situation and were flustered during handling, causing people to spend two hours in disappointment and darkness.

    Through this inspection, it was found that neglecting ideological and political work was a common phenomenon among leaders at all levels. Some leaders believe that ideological and political work cannot solve practical problems; some leaders of administrative departments believe that ideological education is the business of the Party, labor union, and Youth League, and are accustomed to administrative orders; when arranging work, they only give simple indicators, numbers, and simple measures; some individuals even mistakenly believe that "production" is "politics." At the same time, due to the rapid development of production, 40% of the plant's workers are new workers who have only recently joined the plant. They are only focused on business and technical education, while neglecting political education. Therefore, the phenomena of "seeking ease and disliking work" and lax labor discipline have grown more common among employees, and some individuals even absent themselves from work.

    In response to the above situation, the Party Committee convened a meeting of branch secretaries, deputy directors of workshops, and deputy section chiefs and above to conduct discussions. It was decided to start by strengthening ideological and political work, taking measures to improve the quality of on-site training, deeply educating the masses, conscientiously implementing regulations and systems, preventing accidents from continuing to occur, and ensuring safe power generation.

### 南昌电厂忽视政治工作  三个月连续发生七次停电事故

    南昌电厂忽视政治工作
    三个月连续发生七次停电事故
    本报讯　近三个月来，南昌电厂曾经连续发生大小停电事故七起，给全市工业生产和人民生活带来了很大损失。
    厂党委会针对事故发生的情况，进行了全面的检查分析。认为除某些有关规程技术等方面的原因外，忽视思想政治工作是事故不断产生的主要原因。从事故发生的性质来看，大都属于人为过失。如1956年11月3日出事故前，因为负荷低，值班运行人员思想就松懈起来。司炉上楼去“打焦”，副司炉也叫别人替他操作，自己吃饭去了，连值班钳工也不在炉前，结果机器出了故障，大家跑来一时却搞不清情况，因此，对事故判断处理发生了错误，造成被迫停机停电事故。事故发生了，也没有引起领导上的足够重视，接着于11月26日又因调度不当，锅炉值班长对全场工作未作周密布置，严重的是工人交接班制度马虎，以致发生了事故，甚至到事故发生的时候，×号机司机尚不知该机器当时的运行方式。结果，停电达八个多小时。当时该厂领导上虽然针对这个严重的教训，发动群众进行了一次安全规程大检查，但是不深不透，事故仍然连接发生。1月15日七里街分场一个青年工人，在作开关闪光试验的时候，扭错了开关，造成停机停电，使很多工厂因电源突然中断而停止生产。2月1日，正当人们欢度春节的时候，又因值班人员对事故情况掌握不够，处理时手忙脚乱，而造成全市停电，使人们扫兴摸黑度过了两个多小时。
    通过这次检查，发现在各级领导人员中，忽视思想政治工作，是较普遍的现象。有些领导人员认为思想政治工作不能解决现实问题；有些行政部门的领导人员认为思想教育工作是党、工、团的事，习惯于行政命令；布置工作时，只是简单的几个指标数字和几项简单的措施；甚至有个别人错误地认为“生产”即“政治”。同时，由于生产的迅速发展，全厂有40％是进厂不久的新工人，对他们也只着重业务技术的教育，而忽视政治教育。因此，在职工中较普遍滋长着“好逸恶劳”和劳动纪律松弛的现象，个别的甚至旷工缺勤。
    党委会针对上述情况，召开了各支部书记、车间副主任和各科副科长以上的干部会议，进行了讨论。决定从加强思想政治工作着手，采取措施，以提高现场培训质量，深入教育群众，认真贯彻执行规程制度，杜绝事故继续发生，保证安全发电。
