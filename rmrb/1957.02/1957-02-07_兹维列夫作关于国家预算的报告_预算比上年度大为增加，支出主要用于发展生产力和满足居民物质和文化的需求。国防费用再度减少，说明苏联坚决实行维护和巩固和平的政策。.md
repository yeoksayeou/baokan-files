Xinhua News Agency, February 6th. (TASS dispatch) Soviet Finance Minister Zverev, in his budget report to the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting, said that the 1957 Soviet national budget is planned to be 614.8 billion rubles in terms of revenue and 603.8 billion rubles in terms of expenditure. Compared with the 1956 budget, revenue increased by nearly 32 billion rubles and expenditure increased by 43 billion rubles. The national budgets of the various union republics are set at 193.3 billion rubles, 11.7% more than last year and twice as much as in 1950.

In his report on the 1957 Soviet national budget and the implementation of the 1955 Soviet national budget, Zverev first spoke about the main figures for the implementation of the 1955 budget and the preliminary summary of 1956. He said that the 1955 budget was 100.7% complete in terms of revenue and 101.2% complete in terms of expenditure; revenue exceeded expenditure by 24.8 billion rubles. According to preliminary materials, the 1956 Soviet national budget was completed with revenue of 583 billion rubles and expenditure of 561 billion rubles. The budget was 100.5% complete in terms of revenue and 100.7% complete in terms of expenditure.

Zverev pointed out that in 1957, the Soviet national income will increase by 8% on the basis of expanding material production and increasing social labor productivity.

Zverev then analyzed the revenue of the Soviet 1957 budget. He said that the accumulation of the socialist economy accounts for 85% of the total budget revenue, while the proportion of residents' taxes has decreased from 8.7% last year to 8.4%. The total amount of taxes will be reduced by 1.5 billion rubles, because the minimum wage subject to tax payment has been relaxed from January 1 this year, and a large number of employees will not pay taxes. The income from public bonds in the budget will decrease because the number of public bonds issued will be a quarter less than last year, but the total amount of principal and interest on national public bonds is set at 15.4 billion rubles, which is 1.5 billion rubles more than last year.

Zverev said that the main part of the expenditure of the Soviet national budget is used to develop the country's productive forces and meet the material and cultural needs of residents. The total amount of expenditure for developing various industrial sectors is 201.4 billion rubles, of which 118.4 billion rubles is allocated from the budget. The most funds are used to develop industries such as metallurgy, fuel, power, and building materials. A large amount of funds is also allocated for the development of light industry and the food industry.

The Soviet Finance Minister then talked about using the large amount of state funds invested in industry more productively and economically. He pointed out that we still have many enterprises that not only cannot guarantee the prescribed amount of profit, but also suffer losses. For example, the steel, logging, and coal mining industries all suffer great losses, which is contrary to the principles of socialist economics. He believes that ensuring that every enterprise has a surplus is a task of great importance. Those leaders who cause enterprises to suffer losses due to unsatisfactory work should be condemned by public opinion. The Ministry of Finance is taking some measures to strengthen the inspection of financial and economic work in enterprises.

In agriculture, 61.6 billion rubles will be allocated this year, of which 52.9 billion rubles will be allocated from the budget. In the past three years, 150 billion rubles have been allocated to agriculture from the budget, which is 41 billion rubles more than in the previous three years. These funds have promoted the upsurge and further development of various agricultural sectors.

The investment in capital construction this year is 175 billion rubles, but in reality 178.6 billion rubles will be allocated in order to ensure this investment amount and increase the working capital in construction projects.

The Soviet national economic plan and budget clearly embody the Party and government's concern for the people's welfare. The expenditure on social and cultural measures in this year's budget has increased by 24.5 billion rubles compared with last year, reaching 188.2 billion rubles. This year's national social insurance and social support funds will be 16.3 billion rubles more than last year, which is one-third more. This is related to the improvement of social insurance and the increase in preferential treatment standards.

Zverev said that in order to realize the urgent task of expanding housing construction proposed by the December Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, the housing construction allocation this year is 29.9 billion rubles, which is 4.9 billion rubles more than last year. In addition, the state will also issue private housing construction loans worth 1.8 billion rubles.

The national budget this year stipulates that defense expenditure is 96.7 billion rubles, accounting for 16% of the total budget expenditure; while last year it was 102.5 billion rubles, accounting for 18% of the total budget. This is the result of the Soviet Union's adoption of disarmament measures and the gradual reduction of defense expenditure, which also proves that the Soviet Union is determined to implement a policy of maintaining and consolidating peace.

Zverev finally said that the smooth implementation of the budget will promote the greater prosperity of our great motherland and achieve new achievements in communist construction.

    兹维列夫作关于国家预算的报告
    预算比上年度大为增加，支出主要用于发展生产力和满足居民物质和文化的需求。国防费用再度减少，说明苏联坚决实行维护和巩固和平的政策。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联财政部长兹维列夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上作预算报告时说，1957年苏联国家预算在收入方面计划为六千一百四十八亿卢布，在支出方面为六千零三十八亿卢布。和1956年的预算相比，收入差不多增加三百二十亿卢布，支出增加四百三十亿卢布。各加盟共和国的国家预算规定为一千九百三十三亿卢布，比去年多11.7％，为1950年的两倍。
    兹维列夫在他的关于1957年苏联国家预算和1955年苏联国家预算执行情况的报告中，首先谈到了1955年预算执行情况的主要数字和1956年的初步总结。他说，1955年的预算在收入方面完成100.7％，在支出方面完成101.2％；收入超过支出二百四十八亿卢布。根据初步材料，1956年苏联国家预算的完成情况是，收入五千八百三十亿卢布，支出五千六百一十亿卢布。预算在收入方面完成100.5％，在支出方面完成100.7％。
    兹维列夫指出，在1957年，苏联国民收入将在扩大物质生产和提高社会劳动生产率的基础上增加8％。
    兹维列夫接着分析了苏联1957年预算的收入。他说，社会主义经济积累占整个预算收入总额的85％，而居民纳税所占的比例从去年的8.7％减少到8.4％。赋税的总额将减少十五亿卢布，这是因为从今年1月1日起缴税的工资的最低限额放宽了，大量的职工都将不缴税。预算中的公债收入将因比去年少发行四分之一而减少，但是国家公债的还本付息总额定为一百五十四亿卢布，即比去年多十五亿卢布。
    兹维列夫说，苏联国家预算的支出的主要部分用在发展国家的生产力、满足居民物质和文化的需求。发展工业各部门的费用总额为二千零十四亿卢布，其中由预算拨款一千一百八十四亿卢布。用于发展冶金、燃料、动力和建筑材料等工业的款项最多。为发展轻工业和食品工业也拨出大笔款项。
    苏联财政部长接着谈到要更有生产效力地和更经济地使用国家投在工业上的大量资金。他指出，我们还有不少企业，非但不能保证所规定的利润数目，而且受到亏损。如钢铁、伐木和采煤工业部门都受到很大的亏损，这是同社会主义经济原则相违背的。他认为保证每一个企业有赢余，这是具有十分重要意义的任务。那些由于工作的不能令人满意而使企业遭受亏损的领导人，应当受到舆论的谴责。财政部正在采取一些措施以加强对企业中的财经工作的检查。
    在农业方面，今年将要拨出六百一十六亿卢布，其中从预算中拨出五百二十九亿卢布。在过去三年间从预算中拨给农业的经费是一千五百亿卢布，比前三年多了四百一十亿卢布。这些资金促进了各农业部门的高涨和进一步发展。
    今年基本建设的投资是一千七百五十亿卢布，但实际上要拨出一千七百八十六亿卢布，以便保证这个投资数额和增加建设工程中的流动资金。
    苏联国民经济计划和预算显明地体现了党和政府对人民福利的关怀。今年的预算中社会文化措施的支出比去年增加二百四十五亿卢布，达到一千八百八十二亿卢布。今年的国家社会保险和社会赡养经费将比去年多一百六十三亿卢布，也就是多三分之一。这是同社会保险事业的改善和优抚金标准的提高有关的。
    兹维列夫说，为了实现苏共中央十二月全会提出的扩大住宅建筑的迫切任务，今年的住宅建筑拨款是二百九十九亿卢布，比去年多了四十九亿卢布。此外，国家还将发放为数十八亿卢布的私人住宅建筑贷款。
    今年国家预算中规定国防费用为九百六十七亿卢布，占预算全部开支的16％；而去年是一千零二十五亿卢布，占全部预算的18％。这是由于苏联采取了裁军措施，防务费用逐渐减少了的结果，这也证明了苏联坚决实行维护和巩固和平的政策。
    兹维列夫最后说，预算的顺利执行将促进我们伟大的祖国更加繁荣，在共产主义建设方面获得新的成就。
