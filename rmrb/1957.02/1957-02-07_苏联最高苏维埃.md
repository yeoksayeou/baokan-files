The Sixth Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union opened on February 5th.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the supreme organ of state power and the sole legislative body of the Soviet Union. It is elected by the people according to the principles of universal, equal, and direct suffrage using secret ballots, with a term of four years.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union exercises all the rights vested in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics under Article 14 of the Soviet Constitution: it is responsible for enacting all-Union laws, defining the national economic plans of the Soviet Union, approving the unified state budget of the Soviet Union, deciding on issues of war and peace, supervising the observance of the Soviet Constitution, ensuring that the constitutions of the Union Republics conform to the Soviet Constitution, amending the Soviet Constitution, and admitting new republics into the Soviet Union, etc.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union elects the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, organizes the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, elects the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, and appoints the Procurator-General of the Soviet Union. All these bodies are accountable to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union possesses unlimited rights to supervise the activities of the entire state apparatus. When necessary, it may organize committees of inquiry and investigation on any issue. All organs and civil servants must comply with the requirements of these committees and provide them with the necessary materials and documents. The Supreme Soviet has the power to repeal any instruction of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet or the government. Deputies of the Supreme Soviet may address inquiries to the government or individual ministers regarding their activities, and the person questioned must respond within three days.

The Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country, so the Supreme Soviet consists of two chambers: the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. The Soviet of the Union represents the common interests of all working people, while the Soviet of Nationalities embodies the special interests of each nationality. The Soviet of the Union is elected by electoral districts, with one deputy elected for every 300,000 people; the election of deputies to the Soviet of Nationalities is conducted in another way, that is, regardless of population size, each Union Republic elects 25 deputies, each Autonomous Republic elects 11 deputies, each Autonomous Region elects 5 deputies, and each National Area elects 1 deputy. These two chambers are elected simultaneously, and they meet and work at the same time, with a term of four years. Each chamber enjoys equal rights to initiate legislation. A law is enacted after it is passed by a majority vote in each of the two chambers. The Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities are completely equal.

The current fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union consists of 1,347 deputies in the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. These deputies are outstanding activists and excellent workers of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union.

In February 1955, the Second Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted the famous declaration calling for the establishment of direct contacts between the parliaments of all countries and the exchange of parliamentary delegations in order to strengthen mutual understanding and trust between the peoples of all countries through regular contacts between the parliaments of all countries. This declaration was endorsed by the parliaments of many countries. At present, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is engaged in increasing exchanges with the parliaments of many countries, making significant contributions to the cause of world peace and friendly cooperation among the peoples of all countries.

    苏联最高苏维埃
    第四届苏联最高苏维埃第六次会议已于2月5日开幕。
    苏联最高苏维埃是苏联国家最高权力机关和唯一的立法机关，是由人民按照普遍、平等、直接选举的原则，用秘密投票的方法选出的，任期四年。
    苏联最高苏维埃行使苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟根据苏联宪法第十四条所具有的一切权利：负责颁布全苏联的法律，规定苏联国民经济计划，批准苏联统一的国家预算，决定战争与和平问题，监督苏联宪法的遵行情形，保证加盟共和国宪法与苏联宪法适合，修改苏联宪法，接收新共和国加入苏联等。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举产生苏联最高苏维埃主席团，组织苏联部长会议，选出苏联最高法院和任命苏联总检察长。所有这些机关都对苏联最高苏维埃负责。
    苏联最高苏维埃拥有监督整个国家机关活动的无限权利。必要时，它得组织关于任何问题的审查和调查委员会。所有的机关和公务人员必须执行这些委员会的要求，并向它们提供必要的材料及文件。最高苏维埃有权取消最高苏维埃主席团或政府的任何指示。最高苏维埃代表可以向政府或个别的部长就其活动提出质问，而被质问者必须在三天之内作出答复。
      苏联是个多民族的国家，所以最高苏维埃由联盟院和民族院两院组成。联盟院代表着全体劳动人民的共同利益，民族院则体现着各个民族的特殊利益。联盟院按选区选举，每三十万人口产生一个代表；民族院代表的选举是用另一种方式进行的，即不问人口多少，每一个加盟共和国选出代表二十五人，每一自治共和国选出代表十一人，每一自治州选出代表五人，每一民族州选出代表一人。这两个院是同时选出的，并且同时开会，同时进行工作，任期都是四年。每一个院享有同等的创制法律的权利。法律经过两院中每个院过半数通过后即告成立。联盟院和民族院是完全平等的。
    这一届苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的代表共有一千三百四十七人，这些代表是苏联共产党和政府的杰出活动家和优秀的劳动者。
    1955年2月，第四届苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议通过了著名的宣言，呼吁各国议会之间建立直接的接触，互派议会代表团，以便通过各国议会之间的经常联系而加强各国人民的互相了解和信任。这个宣言得到许多国家议会的赞同。目前，苏联最高苏维埃同许多国家的议会进行着越来越多的交往，对世界和平和各国人民友好合作的事业作出了重大的贡献。　（方萱）
