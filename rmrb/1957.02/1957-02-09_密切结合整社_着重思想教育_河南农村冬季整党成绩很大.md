Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th: In areas of Henan Province where rural winter Party rectification work has concluded, the leadership level of Party branches has been greatly improved, and the morale of Party members is unprecedentedly high.

Henan Province's Party rectification was conducted in close combination with the work of rectifying agricultural cooperatives. Party organizations at all levels paid attention to educating and improving Party members ideologically. When Party rectification began in December of last year, some areas focused solely on criticizing certain Party members' errors and shortcomings in their work, thereby damaging the enthusiasm of some Party members in running the cooperatives. After this deviation was discovered, it was immediately corrected. Generally, all localities first organized Party members to thoroughly understand the documents of the Party's Eighth National Congress, and then deeply summarized the enormous achievements the local Party organizations had made in "taking a new path" and "starting new things" since the realization of agricultural cooperativization last year. Many agricultural cooperative Party branches, while affirming their achievements, examined the losses and waste caused by a lack of experience in operation and management in the past. Although Sima Township in Xingyang County increased its total income by 36% compared to the previous year, it suffered losses and waste of more than 71,000 yuan due to poor management. Through the summary, many Party members improved their understanding and their confidence in running the cooperatives well. They stated that in the new year, they must earnestly correct the shortcomings and errors in their past work.

All localities also paid attention to conducting discussions within the Party through the educational method of comparing good and bad examples, in order to educate Party members to consciously implement the mass line policy in their work. The Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Lushan County organized all Party members in the cooperative to seriously discuss the example of Party members in the Zongzhuang production team who listened attentively to the opinions of the masses and prevented 14,000 jin of wheat from being rained on during the continuous rainy harvest, and the example of the Yangzhuang production team who did not pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses and caused wasted labor in drought-resistant wheat planting. After such discussions, the vast majority of Party members proposed to ensure that they would consult with the masses in everything they encountered in the future. The Party branches of the agricultural cooperatives analyzed the reasons why they had not earnestly implemented the mass line policy in the past, and also formulated plans to improve their future work in response to the shortcomings of the Party branches in the past, such as giving fewer methods and urgent requirements when assigning tasks to Party members, and criticizing too much, which easily fostered the coercive command style of Party members. In many areas, the Party branches of agricultural cooperatives also conducted education on hard work and plain living for Party members, in response to the growing phenomena of some Party member cadres despising labor and becoming detached from the masses in their lives. In Xinxiang County, more than 500 Party members who had originally been detached from production in 86 agricultural cooperatives voluntarily returned to the production teams to directly participate in production after receiving education, strengthening the leadership of the production teams and work groups.

In the process of Party rectification, Party organizations in various places also paid attention to educating Party members to learn to use the method of class analysis to conduct a serious analysis and research on the ideological situation of various members in the cooperative. Through such analysis and research, Party members generally reflected that their eyes were brighter. Some Party members who had been confused by the arguments of a small number of wealthy peasants who were dissatisfied with agricultural cooperativization were even more pleased to say: "In the future, as long as we learn to use the method of class analysis to look at problems, we will have a 'backbone' for our work."

Because all localities paid attention to educating and improving Party members ideologically in this Party rectification, and taught Party members the correct working methods, the morale of Party members was unprecedentedly high. According to statistics from Anyang, Linxian and other places, more than 10% of the rural Party members who were not active enough in the past are now active.

### 密切结合整社　着重思想教育  河南农村冬季整党成绩很大

    密切结合整社　着重思想教育
    河南农村冬季整党成绩很大
    新华社郑州8日电　河南省农村冬季整党工作已经结束了的地区，支部领导水平大大提高，党员情绪空前高涨。
    河南省这次整党是密切结合整顿农业社工作进行的。各级党组织在这次整党工作中，都注意从思想认识上来教育提高党员。去年12月间整党开始时，部分地区由于单纯注意批判某些党员在工作中的错误和缺点，因而损伤了一部分党员的办社积极性。这一偏向被发现后，立即作了纠正。各地一般都先组织党员弄通党的第八次全国代表大会的文件，再深入总结自去年实现农业合作化以后当地党组织在“走新路”、“办新事”的情况下所获得的巨大成绩。不少农业社的党支部在肯定成绩的同时，检查了过去因为经营管理没有经验而造成的损失和浪费的情况。荥阳县司马乡去年虽然总收入较前年增加36％，但因为经营管理不善，社内损失浪费达七万一千多元。通过总结，不少党员提高了认识，也提高了把社办好的信心。他们表示：在新的一年里，一定要认真地改正过去工作中的缺点和错误。
    各地还注意通过好坏事例对比的教育方法，在党内进行讨论，以教育党员在工作中自觉地贯彻执行群众路线方针。鲁山县红星农业社组织全社党员认真讨论了这社宗庄生产队的党员因为虚心倾听群众意见，在阴雨连绵的麦收中使一万四千斤小麦没有被雨淋坏，和杨庄生产队不注意倾听群众意见，抗旱种麦中造成了窝工浪费的事例。经过这样讨论以后，绝大部分党员都提出保证今后遇事一定要和群众商量。各农业社党支部分析了过去没有认真执行群众路线方针的原因，同时还针对过去党支部向党员分配任务时交代办法少、要求急和批评多等容易助长党员的强迫命令作风的缺点，制定出了今后改进工作的计划。不少地区的农业社党支部，还针对一部分党员干部中正在滋长着的轻视劳动和在生活上脱离群众等现象，向党员进行了艰苦朴素的教育。新乡县八十六个农业社内有五百多名原来脱离生产的党员，经过教育以后，自愿回到生产队直接参加生产，加强了对生产队和作业组的领导。
    各地党组织在整党过程中还注意教育党员学会运用阶级分析的方法，对社内各个社员的思想情况进行了认真的分析和研究。通过这样分析研究，党员普遍反映说，他们的眼睛亮了。一些曾经被少数对农业合作化不满的富裕农民的论调迷惑过的党员，更是高兴地说：今后只要学会运用阶级分析的方法看问题，咱们做工作就有了“主心骨”。
    由于各地在这次整党中注意从思想上教育和提高党员，并且教给党员以正确的工作方法，因而党员的情绪空前高涨。根据安阳、林县等地统计，约占农村党员10％以上的过去不够积极的党员，现在都积极起来了。
