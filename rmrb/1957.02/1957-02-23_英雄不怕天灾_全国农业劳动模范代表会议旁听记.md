	Heroes Are Not Afraid of Natural Disasters
	——A Record of Attending the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives
	By Our Correspondent Lin Li

	This year, spring in Beijing seems to be arriving a little late. Until the opening day of the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives—February 18th—the mercury in the outdoor thermometer had not yet crossed the red line above zero; everywhere was ice and snow, everywhere was severe cold.

	The spring cold may bring some trouble to agricultural production. However, the heroes attending this meeting unanimously put forward guarantees to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

	The heroes' bold words can be believed. This is not only because they have full confidence and courage, but also because they do indeed have rich experience in fighting against natural disasters.

	Take last year as an example. In this year, the areas affected by natural disasters in our country were quite extensive, and the degree of disaster was indeed not shallow. However, the main crops in our country not only did not decrease, but also increased by 20 billion catties of grain. How did such an achievement come about?

	Listen to the speech of Comrade Li Shunda from Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province. Last year, in July, when the crops were growing vigorously, hail the size of eggs and hail the size of walnuts hit their area for more than an hour. Sweet potatoes and cabbage were completely destroyed, corn was scattered, and millet lay all over the ground with disheveled heads. They had just painstakingly helped the fallen ones up, and then there was a strong wind, heavy rain, and flash floods. …

	They did not show weakness in the face of natural disasters. They fully utilized the collective strength to fight against disasters. The total output value in 1956 actually increased by 16.8% compared to 1955.

	Last year, the Patriotic Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong, conducted a friendly competition with the Wielimowo Agricultural Cooperative of the People's Republic of Poland. The competition conditions they set were an average yield of 404 catties per mu. However, they encountered forty-six consecutive days of "continuous overcast weather." Usually, the annual rainfall in this area is 665 millimeters, but in these forty-six days, it exceeded twice the annual rainfall. The overcast and rainy weather prevented them from harvesting their wheat on time and risked it becoming moldy. The cooperative director, Lü Hongbin, did not disappoint the trust of the cooperative members. He organized people to thresh with primitive sticks, thresh with modern threshing machines, and used all possible tools. After four days and three nights of intense labor, he saved 50,000 catties of wheat from being lost.

	Soon after, wind and insect disasters followed one after another. Lü Hongbin said: Typhoons uprooted old trees, blew down old houses, and the corn in the fields was scattered, with 20% being broken by the wind; heavy rain flooded more than 500 mu of low-lying land. Later, the corn was infested with corn borers, and aphids appeared in the cotton fields. Despite the disasters coming one after another, the people of the Patriotic Cooperative remained as strong as ever. They said: Since we have participated in international competitions, we must make a good showing; if we don't do well, we will lose face not only for our Patriotic Cooperative, but also for all the farmers in China. They blocked the wind when it came, blocked the rain when it came, and treated the insects when they came. By autumn, they overfulfilled the plan, and the yield per mu was 408.48 catties.

	The Sanshan Cooperative in Zhenhai, Zhejiang, is surrounded by mountains on three sides and faces the sea on one side. Powerful typhoons and huge waves of magnitude twelve destroyed three seawalls and more than 150 houses. Rice was submerged by salt tides on 2,090 mu. Almost all of the cotton crop was lost. More than 70,000 catties of harvested rice were washed away along with the houses, and more than 30 pigs were crushed to death. Under the leadership of the Party branch and cooperative director Zheng Mingyuan, they fully utilized the superiority of collective management and developed diversified operations; as a result, they achieved a better harvest than in the unprecedented bumper year of 1955.

	Zheng Mingyuan said that the disaster relief measures they proposed at that time were "production first, house repairs later, unity and mutual assistance, and overcoming temporary difficulties." They put forward the slogan "The sea washes away our property, and we must take it back from the sea." In the fields damaged by saltwater, they carried out salt drainage and fresh water storage; added three new fishing boats to the aquatic product brigade; and organized the Gaoshan Brigade to go up the mountain to cultivate sweet potatoes; the original cotton brigade switched to growing miscellaneous grains and cutting firewood; at the same time, they helped cooperative members develop sideline production. As a result, the total income increased by 29.8% compared to 1955. The average income per household increased by 90 yuan and 65 cents compared to 1955.

	Before the high tide of cooperativization, Nanwangzhuang Village in Anping County, Hebei Province, had a cooperative run by only three poor peasant households, which Comrade Mao Zedong called "the direction of 500 million peasants." This cooperative has now developed into an advanced cooperative with 325 households and 4,728 mu of cultivated land. Wang Yukun, the director of the Nanwangzhuang Cooperative, said at the meeting that their village used to be a sandy area. In the spring, it was dry, and when the wind blew, the sky was dark. Sometimes lights had to be turned on during the day. Crop yields were very low. Because windbreaks were built in the past few years, the original appearance has been changed. Last year, they also encountered an unprecedented flood. Within one or two hours, most of the land was submerged. They built a six-li flood control embankment, which protected the village and more than 200 mu of crops. They also drained the accumulated water from more than 2,000 mu of land. The 73 mu of corn after drainage yielded 680 catties per mu, an increase of 267% compared to 1955. The Nanwangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative has become more consolidated after being tempered by the struggle against floods. They are confident that a bumper harvest in 1957 is entirely possible.

	Work hard, heroes who overcame the various disasters of 1956, you will surely win consecutive victories in 1957!

    英雄不怕天灾
    ——全国农业劳动模范代表会议旁听记
    本报记者　林里
    今年，北京的春天来得似乎迟了一点。直到全国农业劳动模范代表会议开幕的那天——2月18日，室外寒暑表里的水银柱还没有跨过零度上边的红线；到处是冰雪，到处是严寒。
    春寒，可能给农业生产带来一些麻烦。但是，出席这次会议的英雄们，却异口同声地提出争取今年大丰收的保证。
    英雄们的豪语是可以相信的。这不光是因为他们有着充分的信心和十足的勇气，而且他们的确也有了同自然灾害斗争的丰富经验。
    就说去年吧。这一年，我国遭受自然灾害的地区相当广阔，受灾程度也着实不浅。可是，我国的主要农作物不但没有减产，而且增产了二百亿斤粮食。这样的成绩是怎样来的呢？
    听听山西省平顺县西沟村李顺达同志的发言吧。去年庄稼正长得茂盛的7月，鸡蛋大的冰雹，核桃大的冰雹，在他们那里一连打了一个多钟头。红薯、白菜被毁无遗，玉米东倒西歪，谷子披头散发的躺了一地。千辛万苦，刚刚把倒了的扶了起来，接着又是一场狂风，暴雨，山洪。……
    他们没有在自然灾害面前示弱。他们充分运用集体的力量同灾害抗争。1956年的生产总值，反比1955年增加了16.8％。
    山东莒县爱国农业生产合作社，去年曾跟波兰人民共和国维兰莫瓦农业社进行友谊的竞赛。他们预订的竞赛条件，是每亩平均产量四百零四斤。可是，他们碰上了一连四十六天“连阴天”。往常，这一带每年降雨量是六百六十五公厘，在这四十六天当中，竟超过了全年降雨量的一倍。阴雨使他们的小麦不能按时收割，并有霉烂的危险。社主任吕鸿宾没有辜负社员们的信赖，他组织人们用原始的棍棒打场，用现代化的脱粒机脱粒，利用了一切可能利用的工具，经过四个白天又三个黑夜的紧张劳动，挽救了五万斤小麦的损失。
    不久以后，又连续来了风灾和虫灾。吕鸿宾说：台风拔去了古树，刮倒了旧屋，地里的玉米东倒西歪，有20％被刮断；暴雨淹没了五百多亩洼地。以后，玉米又生了钻心虫，棉花地里出现了蚜虫。尽管灾害接连着灾害，爱国社的人们始终坚强如一。他们说：我们既然参加了国际竞赛，就一定要做出个样子；要是做不好，不光给我们爱国社，而且还给全中国的农民丢脸。他们风来了挡风，雨来了挡雨，虫来了治虫。到秋后，超额完成了计划，每亩地的产量是四百零八点四八斤。
    浙江镇海三山社，三面靠山，一面临海。十二级的强大台风和巨浪，冲毁了三道海塘，冲毁了一百五十多间民房。水稻被咸潮淹没了两千零九十亩。棉花几乎全都没收成。已收获的七万多斤稻子，连粮带屋一起被冲走，还压死了三十多头猪。在党支部和社长郑明元领导下，他们充分地利用了集体经营的优越性，开展了多种经营；结果，获得了比空前丰收的1955年还要好的收成。
    郑明元说他们当时提出的救灾办法，是“先生产，后修屋，团结互助，克服暂时困难”。他们提出了“海水冲走我们的财产，我们要从海里夺回来”的口号。他们在咸水冲坏了的田里，进行排咸蓄淡；为水产大队新添了三只渔船；又组织高山大队上山培育甘薯；原来的棉花大队改种杂粮和砍柴；同时，帮助社员发展副业生产。结果，总收入比1955年增加了29.8％。每户平均比1955年增加收入九十元六角五分。
    在合作化高潮以前，河北省安平县的南王庄村，有一个只有三户贫农办的合作社，毛泽东同志称他们为“五亿农民的方向”。这个社，现在发展成了拥有三百二十五户的高级社，耕地四千七百二十八亩。南王庄社社长王玉坤在会议上说，他们的村庄，原来是一片沙土。春天干燥，刮起风来天昏地暗，有时候白天也要点灯。庄稼产量很低。因为前几年造了防风林，就改变了原来的面貌。去年他们也遇见了史无前例的洪水。一两个钟头以内，就淹没了大部分土地。他们修了六华里防洪堤，保住了村庄，保住了二百多亩庄稼。他们还排除了二千多亩地的积水。有七十三亩脱水后的玉米，每亩打了六百八十斤，比1955年增产267％。南王庄农业社，经过跟洪水搏斗的锻炼，越发巩固了。他们有把握地说：1957年的大丰收，是完全可能的。
    努力吧，战胜了1956年各种灾害的英雄们，你们在1957年一定能连战连胜！
