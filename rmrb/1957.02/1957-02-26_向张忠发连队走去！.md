    March Towards Zhang Zhongfa's Company!
    Ma Tieding
    After seeing the movie "Shangganling," communist morality and collectivist spirit are no longer abstract principles, but tangible entities.
    When water is extremely scarce, and everyone's mouth is parched, everyone needs water, everyone wants to drink water, but when you actually pick up the water bottle, it's more like pretending to drink than actually drinking. When the enemy releases poisonous gas, everyone needs protective gear, but we see this scene: the company commander is holding a machine gun, firing at the enemy, and the medic Wang Lan covers the company commander's mouth with her only towel, supporting him until she faints. Why is this? Because they are not thinking of themselves, but first and foremost of their comrades, their brothers-in-arms, and the entire company!
    Here is a noble common language: suffering belongs to oneself, happiness and joy belong to others. No, saying "suffering" is not entirely correct, it should be said: to make one's comrades, brothers-in-arms, and company happy and joyful is one's greatest happiness and joy!
    Please allow me to make a hypothesis: if you and your comrades are traveling in the desert and haven't had water for a long time, and suddenly find a bottle of nectar. What attitude will you take? I think there can be three kinds: one is to be afraid that the nectar will be drunk by others, rushing forward and drinking it all in one gulp; one is to neither want too much nor too little, dividing it into equal shares; and the other is to satisfy others as much as possible, and be happy even without getting a single drop. This problem has been solved in Zhang Zhongfa's company, but it has not been solved among some other people, and is even far from being solved.
    True, we are not really traveling in the desert, we live in Beijing or somewhere else, and water is not too scarce. Just turn on the tap, and the water flows out. However, many of our necessities of life are not all like water, many are not abundant, and cannot endlessly satisfy everyone's needs. Buying rice requires rice coupons, buying cloth requires cloth coupons, and buying pork requires queuing, which is proof. It is on this issue that everyone has been tested and continues to be tested. Hasn't there been such a thing? The meeting to mobilize grain conservation has not yet ended or has just ended, and some people rush to the street to snap up rice and white flour; when pork is scarce, some people insist on trying every means to buy more pork; when housing is tight, some people and some units that already live quite comfortably continue to expand their space; and some simply use their convenience and privileges to preferentially enjoy things that everyone needs but are relatively scarce. If someone proposes "this trend cannot be allowed to continue," they will be labeled with a "egalitarianism" or other dishonorable hat.
    In Ostrovsky's play "Family Happiness," there is a businessman named Bolshov who has a philosophy of life: "I only want to make myself as good as possible, as for who suffers or who benefits, that's none of my business; if someone is suffering, then it's their own fault: they are too careless!" In Bolshov's mirror, don't some people's shadows and even their mental state appear, more or less?
    I hope that those who only care about themselves and not about others will feel their faces burning when watching "Shangganling." This does not contain any schadenfreude, because knowing shame is close to courage. A burning face shows that they are beginning to feel that some garbage needs to be swept away in their souls; there have been some shameful things that need to be corrected. Their erroneous ideological journey needs to change direction: march towards Zhang Zhongfa's company!

    向张忠发连队走去！
    马铁丁
    看了电影“上甘岭”之后，共产主义道德、集体主义精神就再不是抽象的原则，而是可感可触的实体了。
    当水非常缺少，大家嘴里渴得将要冒烟的时候，谁也需要水，谁也想喝水，但真正拿起水瓶的时候，与其说是喝水，倒不如说做个喝水的样子。当敌人放毒气的时候，谁都需要防毒用具，但我们看到这么一幕：连长在托着机枪向敌人射击，卫生员王兰把自己仅有的一条毛巾捂住连长的嘴，一直支持到自己昏倒。为什么这样呢？因为他们考虑的不是自己，首先是自己的同志、战友和整个连队！
    这里有一条崇高的共同语言：受苦受难属于自己，幸福愉快属于别人。不，说“受苦受难”并不是完全正确的，应该说：让自己的同志、战友、连队幸福、愉快，正是自己最大的幸福和愉快！
    请允许我来一个假设：假如你和你的战友们在沙漠旅行，很久没有喝上水了，忽然发现了一瓶甘露。你将采取什么态度呢？我想可以有三种：一种是生怕甘露被别人喝去，抢上一步，端起来一饮而尽；一种是既不想多得，少了也不成，分得平均分派的一份；还有一种，尽量地满足别人，自己一滴没有分到，也是乐意的。这个问题，在张忠发连队已经解决了，可是在别一些人中间则是没有解决的，甚至于离解决问题还差得很远。
    不错，我们并不是真的在沙漠上旅行，我们住在北京或其他什么地方，水并不太缺，把水龙头的开关一拧，水就哗啦啦地流。我们的许多生活必需品，却并不都像水一样，许多生活必需品并不都是很充足的，并不能无限止地满足每个人的需要。买米要米票，买布要布票，买猪肉要排队，就是证明。就在这个问题上，曾经考验过、还在继续考验着每个人。不是有过这样的事吗？动员节约粮食的会议还没有散或刚刚结束，就有人飞快地走上街抢购大米，抢购白面了；在猪肉紧张的时候，有人偏要千方百计地去多买一些猪肉；在住房紧张的时候，有的人、有的单位住得已经相当宽裕了，还在继续扩张空间；还有的干脆利用自己的方便和特权，优先享受那些大家需要而又比较缺少的东西。如果有人提出“此风不可长”，会被戴上一顶“平均主义”或其他不光彩的帽子。
    奥斯特罗夫斯基的剧本“家庭幸福图”里，有个名叫鲍尔萧夫的商人，他有一项处世哲学：“我只想把自己尽量弄得好一点，至于谁挨受谁的折磨，或者谁得到利益，这可不干我的事；要是有谁在受苦，那末这是他自己的过错：他太疏忽啦！”在鲍尔萧夫这面镜子里，不是或少或多地照出一些人的影子乃至他们的精神状态吗？
    我希望那些只顾自己、不顾别人的人，在看“上甘岭”的时候，脸上发烧。这里决不包含任何幸灾乐祸的意思，因为知耻近乎勇。脸上发烧，表明他们开始感到：自己灵魂里有些垃圾需要扫净；曾经有过一些不得见人的事情需要纠正。他们的错误的思想行程需要转变一个方向：向张忠发连队走去！
