    Trying to Rhyme with Chairman Mao
         Guo Moruo
     Nian Nu Jiao
          Little Tangshan
     The capital's strategic point,
     Little Tangshan, a stream of colorless hot springs.
     Thousands of new buildings have been established,
     Introducing clear springs into jade ponds.
     Winter feels like spring,
     North wind breeds warmth,
     Turtles and soft-shelled turtles swim in the stream.
     How does it compare to Huaqing?
     It's hard to say which is superior.
     Lingering by the Jasper Bridge,
     The desolate pond awaits management,
     Still covered in ice and snow.
     Pointing to the dilapidated building, reminiscing about the past,
     People say it was the end of a prosperous dynasty,
     Empress Dowager Cixi often visited,
     The bathing palace is destroyed,
     Selfish pleasure led to the downfall of the nation.
     Look at today,
     Soldiers and civilians share the warmth.
     Lang Tao Sha
          Watching Ice Skating
     Snow waves lock in the clouds and mist,
     The water surface stretches across the sky,
     Pairs of ice skates cut through the ice.
     People fly by like shooting stars,
     Boundless joy.
     The eye can see only youth,
     Striving to be the first,
     Carefree wandering enters a new chapter.
     Paradise on earth is now realized,
     In the blink of an eye.
     Shui Diao Ge Tou
          On the Way Home
     Not envying the birds of Heavenly Lake,
     Nor admiring the fish of the Northern Sea.
     In an instant, riding the wind for thousands of miles,
     Iron wings spread in the clouds.
     Just passed New Siberia,
     Already arrived in Ulaanbaatar,
     The Gobi Desert is viewed without end.
     Who says the universe is vast?
     It's like a bubble to me.
     Singing wearily,
     Heroic talks cease,
     Unrolling the painting.
     The Great Wall suddenly appears before my eyes,
     Lofty and winding through the clouds.
     Mountains upon mountains horizontally painted with dark blue,
     Everyone in the sky bows their heads,
     And Kunming Lake is seen again.
     The landscape is beautiful,
     Today's atmosphere is extraordinary.

    试和毛主席韵	郭沫若
     念奴娇
          小汤山
     京畿肘翼，
     小汤山，一脉温泉无色。
     广厦万间新建立，
     引入玉池清澈。
     冬日疑春，
     朔风孕暖，
     溪内游龟鳖。
     华清何似？
     令人高下难说。
     小伫怀碧桥边，
     荒池待理，
     犹自封冰雪。
     遥指颓楼思往事，
     人道胜朝末截，
     那拉常游，
     浴宫已毁，
     独乐亡家国。
     请看今日，
     兵民同享温热。
     浪淘沙
          看溜冰
     雪浪锁云燕，
     水面横天，
     刀鞋对对剪冰船。
     人似流星飞过去，
     快活无边。
     举目尽青年，
     争著先鞭，
     逍遥游又入新篇。
     地上乐园今实现，
     转瞬之间。
     水调歌头
          归途
     不羡天池鸟，
     不慕北溟鱼。
     瞬息乘风万里，
     铁翼云中舒。
     才过新西比利，
     已到乌兰巴托，
     翰海览无余。
     谁谓乾坤大？
     浑似一沤夫。
     高歌倦，
     雄谈歇，
     展画图。
     长城蓦地眼底，
     岪郁盘云途。
     地上山山横黛，
     天上人人俯首，
     又见昆明湖。
     锦绣山河好，
     今朝气象殊。
            1957年1月23日
