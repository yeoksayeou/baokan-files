Xinhua News Agency, February 19th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Zhiqing reports: The head of the Ministry of Food Industry recently spoke to reporters in the capital on the issue of how to carry out the production increase and conservation movement in the food industry. He believes that this industry still has a lot of potential to be tapped.

    Food Industry has many potential to be tapped
    Equipment capacity has not been fully utilized, the utilization rate of raw materials is very uneven, and the quality of many products is not good. If raw material resources can be fully utilized and expanded, and the rejection rate reduced, production can be greatly increased.

The head of the Ministry of Food Industry said that the potential of the food industry is manifested in all aspects. All industries have potential in terms of equipment. For example, the unutilized equipment capacity in the cigarette and edible oil industries is still 30% - 50%. Although the equipment potential in the soap, sugar, canned food, and brewing industries is not large, the difference in equipment utilization rates between different enterprises in the same industry is also very large.

The uneven utilization rate of raw materials is also a major aspect of the food industry's consideration of how to realize its potential. In the sugar industry, the planned output of local sugar this year accounts for 39.18% of the country's sugarcane sugar output. At present, the sugar extraction rate of local sugar varies greatly. For example, the average sugar extraction rate in Guangdong Province reaches 10%, while in Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces, it only reaches about 6.5%. Although the sugar content of sugarcane is different, comparing the sugar content with the sugar extraction rate, the raw material utilization rate in Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces is also very low. In the salt industry, the disparity in output is also very large. According to the materials from 1956, the output of two production units with the same conditions differs by 20% - 30%. In the brewing industry, the highest liquor yield is 78%, and the lowest is only 47%. If the liquor yield averages 60%, each ton of liquor can save more than one thousand jin of grain based on the current average grain consumption.

Improving the quality of various foods and reducing the rejection rate is also an important link in increasing production. In 1956, although a lot of work was done in improving and upgrading product quality and certain achievements were made, there are still serious problems in the quality of many products. For example, there are currently seven hundred tons of egg powder that do not meet the national standards. The apple sauce made by the Tianjin Canned Food Factory with white sugar contained burlap fibers, making 250,000 tons of canned food unqualified, resulting in a loss of 100,000 yuan. In 1956, the Tianjin Monopoly Company inspected and found more than 3,000 boxes of unqualified cigarettes.

When talking about fully utilizing raw materials and increasing food production, the person in charge said: The current shortage of raw materials in the food industry is a practical difficulty, but production can be greatly increased by trying every means to find various substitutes and fully utilizing and expanding raw material resources. At present, the loss of sugar crops in the sugar industry during harvesting, transportation, and processing is very serious. Taking sugarcane as an example, the general loss in various provinces is 15% - 25%. If some measures are taken to rationally organize transportation and shorten storage time, the loss of sugarcane can be reduced. If the national sugarcane loss rate is reduced by 1%, the annual sugar production can be increased by more than 10,000 tons. In the edible oil industry, it is also possible to open up new oil sources. China is extremely rich in wild oil crops. According to current discoveries and chemical verifications, there are more than 70 kinds of oil crops available for oil extraction. If these oil crops can be used, the output of oils and fats can be greatly increased. In salt production, if we strengthen brine cultivation, brine preservation, and do a good job in beach field maintenance and repairs, improve the utilization of effective evaporation, reduce infiltration losses, and improve labor organization, the national estimated salt production can be increased by hundreds of thousands of tons. In the dairy industry, the raw material loss rates in different regions vary greatly. For example, the raw material loss rate of Yimin No. 3 Factory is only 0.97%, while that of Songjiang Canned Food Factory is 2%, and that of Anda Milk Powder Factory is as high as 3.17%. If the latter two factories reduce the loss by 1%, they can save 390 tons of raw materials throughout the year.

    食品工业有许多潜力可挖
    设备能力没有充分发挥，原材料利用率很不平衡，不少产品的质量不好。　如果能够充分利用和扩大原材料资源，降低废品率，就可以大大增产。
    新华社19日讯　新华社记者张志清报道：食品工业部负责人最近就食品工业中如何开展增产节约运动的问题，向首都的记者发表谈话，他认为这个行业还有许多潜力可挖。
    食品工业部负责人说，食品工业的潜力表现在各个方面。各行业在设备方面都有潜力。如卷烟、食油等行业没有发挥的设备能力，还有30％—50％。肥皂、食糖、罐头、酿酒行业的设备潜力虽然不大，但是同一个行业的各个企业之间的设备利用率，悬殊也是很大的。
    原材料利用率不平衡的情况，也是食品工业考虑如何发挥潜力的一个主要方面。在制糖行业中，今年土糖计划产量占全国甘蔗糖产量的39.18％，目前土糖的产糖率高低不一。如广东地区产糖率平均达到10％，而湖北、湖南等省仅达到6.5％左右。虽然甘蔗含糖量有所不同，但是以所含糖分同产糖率比较，湖北、湖南等省原材料利用率也是很低的。在食盐行业中，产量高低悬殊也很大。根据1956年的材料，两个条件相同的生产单位，产量却相差20％—30％。在酿酒行业中，白酒的出酒率最高为78％，最低的只有47％。如果出酒率平均达到60％，每吨白酒按照目前平均用粮，可以节约粮食一千多市斤。
    提高各种食品质量，降低废品率，也是增加产量的重要环节。1956年中，在提高和改进产品质量方面虽然作了不少工作，取得了一定的成绩。但是，还有不少产品在质量方面，存在着严重的问题。如目前就有七百吨蛋粉没有达到国家规定的标准。天津罐头厂用白砂糖制造的苹果酱，因为糖里含有麻袋毛，使二十五万吨罐头不合格，造成十万元的损失。天津专卖公司在1956年中，检查出不合格的卷烟有三千多箱。
    负责人在谈到充分利用原材料，增加食品产量时说：目前食品工业原材料不足是一个实际困难，但是从多方面千方百计的寻找多种代用品，充分利用和扩大原材料资源，就可以大大增加产量。目前在制糖行业中，糖料作物的收割、运输和加工生产过程中的损失是很严重的。以甘蔗为例，各省一般损耗是15％—25％，如果采取一些措施，合理组织调运，缩短贮存时间，甘蔗的损耗是可以减少的。如果全国甘蔗损耗率减少1％，全年就可以增产糖一万吨以上。在食油行业中，开辟新油源也是可能的。我国野生油料作物极为丰富，据目前已经发现并经化验证明可供榨油的油料作物，就有七十多种。如能设法利用这些油料，就能大大增加油脂的产量。在食盐生产中，如果加强养滷、保滷和作好滩田维护检修工作，提高有效蒸发量的利用，减少渗透损失，改善劳动组织，全国预计可以增产几十万吨食盐。在乳制品行业中，各地原材料损耗率相差很大。如益民三厂原材料损耗率只有0.97％，松江罐头厂就有2％，安达乳粉厂高达3.17％，如果后两个厂降低损耗1％，全年就可以节约原材料三百九十吨。
