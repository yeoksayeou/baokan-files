Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 24th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Kuihua): At a time when national construction requires a large amount of timber, the waste of timber in Fujian Province's forest areas is very serious. The Fujian Provincial Supervisory Department and the Fujian Provincial Forestry Department recently jointly inspected timber production in forest areas and found that more than 60,000 cubic meters of timber had decayed and deteriorated at the Fuzhou Timber Yard and the Jiangxi Hecun Timber Supply Station, which are under the jurisdiction of the Forestry Industry Bureau. Some of this timber was even felled on the mountains in 1955 and 1954 and left to rot.

In Jian'ou County, in March 1955, workers were organized to fell more than 1,300 cubic meters of large pine trees in Xiaokang Township. By the end of 1956, 630 cubic meters were still abandoned in the mountains, rotting for a full year and a half. Cadres of the local agricultural and forestry production cooperatives had criticized the local forestry departments several times, and even filed a complaint with the county people's court, but no attention was paid. In the end, most of the timber rotted and was downgraded to firewood for sale.

The joint inspection team also saw many large logs with diameters of 40 to 50 centimeters abandoned in mountain areas, roadsides, and streams in the northern Fujian forest area for one or two years without anyone paying attention. During the flood season, batches of timber along the streams were washed away by mountain floods. According to incomplete statistics from the Fujian Forestry Industry Bureau, 91 incidents of floating timber occurred in the province last year, resulting in the loss of more than 65,000 logs.

On the logging sites, large felled trees were left with very high stumps, and piles of usable top wood and side materials were also discarded. At the Chenqian logging site in Jianyang County, the joint inspection team inspected 728 tree stumps and found that the average stump height was 37.2 centimeters, which was more than 17 centimeters higher than the prescribed standard; the highest stump height was 90 centimeters. In addition to discarding a large number of top wood that could be used as mine props, an average of about 6 cubic meters was lost for every 100 cubic meters of timber felled.

The reasons for these serious timber waste phenomena, in addition to the fact that the work of the forestry industry departments in Fujian Province has not kept up with the needs of production development in recent years, and that most of the forests here are privately owned, with more self-felling by the masses, scattered production, and difficulty in controlling planned production, the main reasons are that the forestry industry departments in Fujian Province lack concrete organizational work and in-depth guidance in the links of timber felling, afforestation, storage, and transportation, and lack regular education for cadres, loggers, etc. in forest areas on cherishing timber, and some forestry work cadres are indifferent to the phenomenon of timber waste.

Although the Fujian Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau has put forward instructions on rational felling and rational material production in some meetings and documents, it lacks planned promotion of advanced experience and new tools in various logging sites. Some logging sites simply pay workers according to the volume of timber felled per person, and do not reward workers who fell efficiently, quickly, and cherish timber, thus forming some loggers who only care about felling more and faster to earn more wages, and do not pay attention to saving timber.

Now these timber waste phenomena have attracted the attention of relevant parties. The Fujian Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau is plugging loopholes in timber waste from all aspects and plans to launch a province-wide timber saving campaign in forest areas.

    福建省检查林区浪费木材
    森林工业部门缺乏具体组织和教育工作以致大量木材腐朽流失
    新华社福州24日电　新华社记者刘葵华报道：正当国家建设需要大量木材的时候，福建省林区浪费木材现象却非常严重。福建省监察厅和福建省林业部门最近联合检查了林区木材生产情况，发现森林工业局所属的福州贮木场、江西贺村木材供应站等处腐朽变质的木材，即达六万多立方公尺，其中一部分还是1955年和1954年砍伐下来腐烂在山上的。
    建瓯县在1955年3月间组织工人在小康乡砍伐了一千三百多立方公尺大松木，到1956年底，还有六百三十立方公尺丢在山场上，整整腐朽了一年半以上。当地农林业生产合作社的干部曾经几次向当地林业部门提出批评，直到向县人民法院控告，但是都没有被重视，最后这批木材绝大部分都腐烂，被降为烧柴售出。
    联合检查组在闽北林区还看到很多直径四十到五十公分的粗大木头丢在山场、路旁、溪边一两年之久，无人过问；在洪水季节，沿溪成批木材被山洪冲走。据福建森林工业局不完全统计，去年全省发生九十一次漂木事故，损失木材六万五千多根。
    在伐木场上，成片砍倒的大树都丢下很高的伐根；成堆可以利用的梢头木和边材也被丢弃。在建阳县宸前砍伐场上，联合检查组检查了七百二十八株树根，平均伐根高度三十七点二公分，比规定标准高出十七公分多；最高伐根达九十公分；加上丢弃大批可做矿柱的梢头木，平均每砍伐一百立方公尺木材，就损失约六立方公尺。
    这些严重浪费木材现象产生的原因，除了几年来福建省森林工业部门许多工作赶不上生产发展的需要，以及这里大部是私有林，群众自伐较多，生产分散，掌握计划生产困难等客观困难以外，主要还是福建省森林工业部门在木材砍伐、造林贮运等环节中，缺乏具体组织工作和深入指导，又缺乏经常对林区干部、伐木工人等进行爱护木材的教育，以及一部分林业工作干部对浪费木材现象漠不关心。
    福建省森林工业局在一些会议上和文件中，虽然提出合理采伐、合理造材的指示，但是缺乏有计划地在各个伐木场推广先进经验和推广新的工具。有些砍伐场只简单地按每人砍伐的材积发给工钱，对伐得又省、又快、爱惜木材的工人没有给予奖励，因而形成有些伐木工人只顾砍得多、砍得快，可以多领工钱，不注意节约木材。
    现在这些浪费木材现象，已经引起有关方面的注意。福建省森林工业局正在从各方面堵塞浪费木材的漏洞，计划在林区内全面展开节约木材运动。
