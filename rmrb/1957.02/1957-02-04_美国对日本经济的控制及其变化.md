    U.S. Control of the Japanese Economy and Its Changes	Lan Hai
    Today, eleven years after the war, the Japanese economy still depends on the United States in many ways. However, the U.S. control over the Japanese economy was different before and after the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect in April 1952, and there have been considerable changes in the last two years (1955, 1956).
    In the process of its recovery, Japanese monopoly capital has been extremely eager for the United States to allocate aid funds and absorb U.S. private capital to strengthen its own strength. The United States, on the other hand, used Japan as a base and armory for the war of aggression against Korea, militarizing the Japanese economy. Therefore, at that time, the aid funds provided by the United States to Japan were not unconditional, but as a means of occupying and ruling Japan. At the same time, these aid funds also played a role in strengthening Japanese monopoly capital. However, Japanese monopoly capital is now different from what it used to be, and it has broken away from the situation of relying on political loans or private capital from the United States. When Yoshida visited the United States as Prime Minister in the autumn of 1954, he begged the United States to lend him $1 billion and requested the United States to guarantee the continued issuance of "special procurement" orders. When Finance Minister Ichimanda visited the United States in September 1956, he emphasized the economic cooperation between Japan and the United States in Southeast Asia, that is, combining American capital, Japanese technology and machinery with local raw materials and labor. Comparing these two situations, the changes in the past two years are very significant. This shows that Japanese monopoly capital no longer feels strongly about relying on the United States in domestic investment; now it is only seeking cooperation with the United States because of insufficient capital in order to actively develop overseas capital export markets. More than two years ago, Shigeru Yoshida's cabinet collapsed shortly after he returned home after failing to negotiate a loan from the United States. During Ichimanda's visit to the United States last September, the Hatoyama cabinet determined the policy of the Prime Minister visiting the Soviet Union to complete the Japan-Soviet diplomatic normalization negotiations. When the Japanese government concluded the Third Surplus Agricultural Products Agreement with the United States last year, the amount was reduced by half compared with the previous one. Compared with the past, the need for funds has decreased, and conversely, various unfavorable conditions in this agreement are felt to be a shackle. The Ministry of Finance has changed its past attitude of desiring foreign capital input to an attitude of "foreign capital input must be strictly selected" since the year before last.
    The "special procurement" (supply of U.S. Far East military materials, service contracts, U.S. military personnel consumption, etc.) that began during the Korean War amounted to more than 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in the six years from 1950 to the end of 1955. This special military demand market stimulated the rapid expansion of Japanese production and the increase in profits. At the same time, Japan used this foreign exchange income to make up for the deficit in its international balance of payments and made it possible to import raw materials and machinery and other technical equipment needed to expand production. At least in 1954, Japanese capitalists regarded "special procurement" as indispensable. The highest "special procurement" in 1953 totaled 800 million U.S. dollars; however, due to the Korean armistice, it was reduced to more than 569 million U.S. dollars by 1955. On the other hand, due to the significant increase in exports, Japan's international balance of payments began to achieve a rough balance in 1955 without relying on "special procurement." The proportion and significance of "special procurement" in the Japanese economy has relatively decreased. However, "special procurement" income still accounts for 30% of Japan's dollar income. In 1955, "special procurement" was still more than 569 million U.S. dollars, plus the total value of exports to the United States of 400 million U.S. dollars, totaling 900 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 45% of Japan's total foreign exchange income this year. From this point of view, the Japanese economy is still firmly bound by the U.S. dollar, which cannot be denied.
    The cumulative amount of foreign private capital imported by Japan after the war, up to the end of 1955, was 14.2 billion yen in terms of investment in the purchase of stocks (of which U.S. capital accounted for 70%), and 64 billion yen in terms of loan investment (of which U.S. capital accounted for 67%, and World Bank capital accounted for 30%). In terms of stock purchases, U.S. capital is particularly significant in the oil processing industry, with most of the stocks being controlled by U.S. capital. In terms of loan investment, most of it is used as loans for the price of machinery imported from the United States. The characteristic of foreign capital input after the war is not direct investment, but the form of concluding technical cooperation contracts with foreign capital. By the end of 1955, there were 482 valid technical cooperation contracts, of which U.S. capital accounted for about 70%, and the capital of European countries accounted for 30%. In particular, the electric power industry, electrical machinery manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, oil processing industry, etc. must fully rely on U.S. technology. In the chemical industry, most also rely on U.S. technology.
    According to this technical cooperation contract, 10% to 15% of the selling price is given to the United States as remuneration, and the United States also sells outdated technical equipment to Japan. The amount spent on this technical cooperation contract totaled 20.4 billion yen by the end of 1955. This is simply a "free ride" windfall. Nevertheless, thanks to the input of this technology, Japanese capitalists have, on the one hand, secured the domestic market and accumulated a large amount of capital, and on the other hand, have appropriately reversed the technological backwardness caused by the excessive disparity between wartime and postwar technology and the world's advanced technology.
    The number of technical cooperation contracts reached a maximum of 133 in 1952, and decreased to 72 in 1955. The proportion of U.S. capital has also decreased from 72% before 1953 to 66% after 1954. Japan's technology import is gradually shifting to Europe, the ratio of machinery import volume to the total output value of the machinery manufacturing industry is decreasing, and the tendency to rely on domestic machinery is increasing.
    Most of Japan's industrial raw materials must be imported. Currently, 80% of the coking coal and 50% of the scrap iron imported for iron smelting rely on the United States. In the total import volume of oil, the import from the United States is only 15%, but the oil capital is controlled by the Americans. American cotton and Mexican cotton controlled by the United States account for more than 50% of cotton imports, so cotton imports in fact rely on the United States.
    However, the situation in the early days of the U.S. occupation (1946-1949) generally no longer exists. This refers to the fact that at that time, 90% of steelmaking coking coal, oil, 80% of cotton, and 99% of wheat were supplied by the United States. Moreover, the transactions of these commodities were carried out under the comprehensive trade control of the U.S. occupying authorities. Not only was the quality poor, but the price was also very high. At that time, U.S. commodities accounted for 75% of the total imported goods. The current situation is: U.S. commodities account for only 30%, Asian countries account for 37%, and other countries account for 33%. Now, the United States still has the shackles of the surplus agricultural products agreement on Japan, and Japan has the obligation to purchase cotton from the United States at high prices. Japanese cotton textile capitalists oppose this agreement.
    Recently, the issue of the U.S. government restricting the import of Japanese cotton fabrics has become somewhat acute, but the U.S. policy towards Japan that currently imposes the greatest restrictions on the Japanese economy is the "embargo" policy against socialist countries, especially China. Up to now, Japan is one of the most loyal countries in the world in implementing the U.S. "embargo" policy. However, it is not without changes.
    Japan's exports to China in 1955 were second only to Hong Kong and Pakistan, ranking third among capitalist countries; and in 1956, exports to China, mainly chemical industrial products such as fertilizers and cement, and machinery, increased even more. To counter the U.S. "embargo" policy, the Japanese government also adopted the practice of recognizing the "exception procedure" ex post facto in September last year. In the past, Japan's trade with China was centered on small and medium-sized companies, but since the first half of last year, companies of the old Zaibatsu system have begun to replace their positions. The holding of the Beijing Commodity Exhibition and the visit of the fertilizer delegation to China all show that the trend of Japanese monopoly capital's concern for Japan-China trade is increasingly strengthening. The U.S. "embargo" policy is becoming more and more obviously a stumbling block for Japanese monopoly capital.
    According to the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" concluded in March 1954, the United States provides U.S.-made weapons to Japan free of charge. This enables Japanese monopoly capital to quickly complete rearmament while saving financial expenditures and gaining profits. However, on the other hand, the balanced approach of the army, navy and air force that Japanese monopoly capital strongly demanded from the beginning is still rejected by the United States. The desire of Japanese capitalists to control the profitable military industry in their own hands has not yet been satisfied.
    From these situations, the dependence of the Japanese economy on the United States and the U.S. control over Japan in the economic field are gradually weakening in all aspects. Therefore, it can be said that the Japanese economy is developing in the direction of relative self-reliance. Of course, as mentioned above, although the Japanese economy is still dependent on the United States in all aspects today, the Japan-U.S. relationship is neither the "subordinate" relationship during the period when the U.S. occupiers held full power before the San Francisco Peace Treaty, nor the subordinate relationship under the special military economy during the Korean War. The interests of the monopoly capital of the United States and Japan have both consistency and opposition. It is an undeniable fact that the contradictions between the monopoly capital of the United States and Japan are deepening.
    On the one hand, Japanese monopoly capital still feels that it is profitable to have U.S. "special procurement" orders, exports to the United States, import of U.S. technology, seek U.S. capital assistance for exporting capital to Southeast Asia, and U.S. weapons loans that can save financial expenditures. However, on the other hand, unfavorable situations such as the United States restricting the import of Japanese goods, implementing the "embargo" policy against socialist countries, politically motivated loans with unfavorable conditions, interfering in the preparation of the Japanese budget through defense burden sharing, and suppressing Japan's production of advanced weapons make Japanese monopoly capital feel dissatisfied.
    From the Japan-U.S. economic relations discussed above, the favorable aspects of the Japan-U.S. relationship for Japanese monopoly capital will continue to constrain the foreign policy of the Japanese ruling class in the future, but the unfavorable aspects will also become the main factors for Japan to move towards the revival of imperialism and embark on the path of self-reliance. At present, the internal conflicts of the Japanese reactionary forces and the struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party are all complex reflections of these two aspects.

    美国对日本经济的控制及其变化	蓝海
    战后十一年的今天，日本经济还在许多方面依赖于美国。但是，美国对日本经济的控制，在1952年4月旧金山和约生效以前和生效以后的情况是不一样的，并且最近两年来（1955、1956年）又有了相当的变化。
    日本垄断资本在其恢复的过程中，极力要求美国对日拨发援助资金和吸收美国私人资本，想借以加强自己的实力。美国则把日本当作侵朝战争的基地和军火厂，使日本经济军事化。因此，那时美国给日本援助资金并不是无条件的，它是作为占领和统治日本的一种手段。同时，这种援助资金也起了强化日本垄断资本的作用。可是，现在日本垄断资本和从前不一样，它已摆脱了依赖美国的政治性借款或私人资本的处境。1954年秋天，吉田以首相身份访美的时候，曾经恳求美国贷予十亿美元借款，并请求美国保证继续提出“特需”订货。1956年9月，一万田藏相访美的时候，却强调日美两国在东南亚进行经济合作，就是把美国的资本、日本的技术和机器同当地的原料和劳动力结合起来。把这两种情形对照起来，就可看出这两年内的变化是很显著的。这说明，日本垄断资本在国内投资方面，对于依赖美国一事已无强烈的感觉；现在只是为了积极开辟海外资本输出市场，因资本不足，才寻求同美国合作。两年多以前，吉田茂因向美国借款交涉失败，回国后不久，他的内阁就垮台了。去年9月一万田访美期间，鸠山内阁确定了首相访苏、完成日苏复交谈判的方针。去年日本政府同美国缔结第三次剩余农产品协定时，金额比上一次减少了一半。同过去比起来，需要资金的因素减少了，相反地却感到这一协定中的各种不利条件是一种桎梏。大藏省从前年以来把过去渴望外资输入的态度改为“外资输入时必须严加选择”的态度。
    在朝鲜战争中开始的“特需”（美国远东军用物资的供应，服务性合同，美国军人的消费等），从1950年到1955年年底六年间达三十五亿多美元。这种特殊的军需市场，曾刺激了日本生产的急速扩大和利润的增加。同时，日本用这项外汇收入弥补了国际收支的赤字，并有可能进口为扩大生产所需的原料和机器等技术设备。至少在1954年的时候，日本资本家是把“特需”看成不可缺少的东西。“特需”最高的1953年总计达八亿美元；可是由于朝鲜停战，到1955年便减为五亿六千九百多万美元。另一方面，由于出口的显著增加，1955年的国际收支开始不依靠“特需”而达到大体平衡。“特需”在日本经济中所占的比重和意义相对地减少了。不过，“特需”收入在日本的美元收入中仍占30％。1955年“特需”仍为五亿六千九百多万美元，再加上对美输出总值四亿美元，合计为九亿美元，占这一年日本外汇收入总额的45％。由此看来，日本经济仍然牢固地受美元的束缚，这是不容讳言的。
    战后日本输入外国私人资本的累计额，到1955年末为止，在购买股票的投资方面为一百四十二亿日元（其中美国资本占70％），在贷款投资方面为六百四十亿日元（其中美国资本占67％，世界银行资本占30％）。美国资本在购买股票方面，尤以石油加工工业最为显著，其中大半的股票均为美国资本所掌握。而在贷款投资方面，多半是以从美国进口的机器的价款充作贷款。战后外国资本输入的特征，不是直接投资，而是采取同外国资本缔结技术合作合同的形式。到1955年末，有效的技术合作合同有四百八十二件，其中美国资本占70％左右，欧洲各国的资本占30％。特别是电力工业、电机制造业、飞机制造业、石油加工工业等须全面地依靠美国技术。在化学工业中，多数也依赖美国技术。
    根据这种技术合作合同，以卖价的10％到15％作为酬金交给美国，美国还把已经陈旧的技术设备卖给日本。对于这种技术合作合同所支出的款项，到1955年末累计达二百零四亿日元。这简直是“白占便宜”的暴利。尽管如此，日本的资本家由于这种技术的输入，一方面确保了国内市场，积累了大量资本，另一方面还适当地扭转了在战时和战后因同世界进步技术过分悬殊而造成的技术落后状态。
    技术合作合同的件数，以1952年为最高达一百三十三件，到1955年已减少到七十二件了。其中美国资本所占的比重也从1953年以前的72％减少到1954年以后的66％。日本的技术输入渐渐转到欧洲方面去，机器进口额对机器制造工业总产量的比例在减少，依靠国产机器的倾向增大了。
    日本工业原料大多数都要靠进口，现在进口的炼铁用焦炭的80％和废铁的50％是依靠美国的。在石油的进口总量中，从美国进口的不过15％，但石油资本是掌握在美国人手里的，棉花进口中美棉及美国控制下的墨西哥棉花合在一起占50％以上，因而棉花进口事实上是依靠美国的。
    然而，美国占领初期（1946—1949年）的情况，一般说来现在已经不存在了。这指的是当时原料供应方面有90％的炼钢用焦炭、石油，80％的棉花，99％的小麦都是依靠美国供给的。而且，这些商品的交易是在美国占领当局的全面贸易管制下进行的，不但质量粗劣，而且价格也很高。当时，在整个进口货物中，美国商品占75％。现在的情况是：美国商品只占30％，亚洲国家占37％，其它国家占33％。现在，美国对日本还有剩余农产品协定的束缚，日本有从美国用高价购入棉花的义务。日本棉纺工业资本家反对这个协定。
    最近，美国政府限制日本棉织品进口问题虽有些尖锐化，但目前美国对日政策中使日本经济受到最大限制的则是对社会主义国家特别是对中国的“禁运”政策。到现在为止，日本是世界上执行美国“禁运”政策最忠实的国家之一。不过，也并不是没有变化的。
    日本对中国的输出，在1955年仅次于香港、巴基斯坦，在资本主义国家中占第三位；而在1956年，以肥料、水泥等化学工业制品、机器为主的对中国输出，更为增加。为对付美国的“禁运”政策，日本政府在去年9月也采用了事后承认“例外程序”的作法。过去，日本对中国贸易是以中小公司为中心的，但自去年上半期以来，旧财阀系统的公司开始代替了它们的地位。举办北京商品展览会、肥料代表团访问中国等等，都说明日本垄断资本关心日中贸易的趋势越来越增强了。美国的“禁运”政策，越来越明显地成为日本垄断资本的绊脚石。
    根据1954年3月缔结的美日“共同防御援助协定”，美国对日本无偿地贷予美制武器。这使得日本垄断资本在节省财政开支下迅速地完成重新武装而获得利益。然而，另一方面，日本垄断资本从当初就强烈要求的陆海空军均衡方式，仍然遭到美国的拒绝。日本资本家想把获利多的军火工业掌握在自己手里的欲望至今仍未能得到满足。
    从这些情况看来，日本经济的对美依附、美国在经济上对日本的控制，在各个方面都渐渐削弱下来。因此，可以说日本经济正朝着相对自立的方向发展。当然，如上面所说的，虽然今天日本经济在各方面仍依附于美国，但日美关系既不同于旧金山和约前美国占领者握有全权时期的“隶属”关系，也和朝鲜战争期间在特殊军事经济下的从属关系不一样。美日两国垄断资本的利益有一致性，也有对立的一面。美日两国垄断资本的矛盾在加深是不容讳言的事实。
    日本垄断资本一方面对于美国的“特需”订货、对美输出、输入美国新技术、为向东南亚输出资本而求得美国资本的协助以及能以节省财政开支的美国武器贷予等等，仍然感到有利可图。但另一方面，美国限制日本商品进口、对社会主义国家实行“禁运”政策、附有不利条件的政治性借款、通过防卫分担费干涉日本预算的编制、压制日本生产高级武器等等显然不利的情况，又使日本垄断资本感到不满。
    从以上所谈的日美经济关系来看，今后日美关系中对日本垄断资本有利的一面仍会制约着日本统治阶级的外交政策，但不利的一面也会成为日本向复活帝国主义和走上自立的方向的主要因素。现在，日本反动势力内部的对立、自由民主党内的斗争，都是这两方面因素错综复杂的反映。
