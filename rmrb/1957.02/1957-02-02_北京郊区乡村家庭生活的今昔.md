    The Past and Present of Rural Family Life in the Suburbs of Beijing	Li Jinghan
    (Continued from yesterday)

    Comparison of Actual Living Standards Between Past and Present

    To ensure a clear, striking, and relatively detailed and accurate comparison, let me use a common, ordinary five-person household as the unit of measurement for contrasting past and present life. This means consolidating the values related to living expenses from the surveyed families, both large and small, into the values for this unit (similar to the method of converting the population of different genders and ages into equivalent "adult males"). This five-person household includes a couple of able-bodied adults, a boy and a girl between the ages of six and twelve, and an elderly father or mother over fifty years old. For monetary comparison, unless otherwise specified as silver dollars used in the past, all figures are in current Renminbi. In the "past," this roughly refers to the period of the previous thirty years, during which many rural life surveys were conducted in the suburbs of Beijing. In terms of purchasing power, one silver dollar at that time was equivalent to approximately 2.62 Renminbi in 1956, or one Renminbi in 1956 was equivalent to 0.38 silver dollars in 1926. All monetary figures used in this article have been converted, and all units of measurement have been converted to current units.

    (1) Food

    Rice and Flour:  In the daily consumption of these rural families, food occupies the main portion, and among food, rice and flour are the main components. In the past, an ordinary five-person household used about 1,800 catties of rice and flour annually, approximately 150 catties per month. Coarse grains accounted for more than 95% of this, including corn flour, millet, millet flour, buckwheat flour, sorghum, and beans. Fine grains, including white rice and white flour, accounted for only about 5% or less. Guajiatun is a rice-producing village, but the rice farmers themselves could not afford to eat rice, only eating white rice a dozen times a year. Many families ate more sweet potatoes during the cold season, using more than 1,000 catties a year. Almost every meal consisted of cornbread, millet porridge, or things like vegetable scraps and old pumpkins. Many extremely poor households could not even reach this low standard of living. Today, in the nearly 2,000 catties of rice and flour used annually by a five-person household, fine grains account for about 60% and coarse grains about 40%. White rice accounts for slightly more than 60% of the fine grains, and white flour slightly less than 40%.

    Vegetables:  The secondary component of food for these families is vegetables. In the past, the most common vegetables for a five-person household were pickled radishes, pickled mustard greens, chili peppers, and other kinds of pickled vegetables, using more than 100 catties a year, about 20 catties per person, or only about one tael per person per day. Even the most commonly eaten vegetable for Beijingers, Chinese cabbage, was only used about 200 catties a year in these families, with each person eating only 40 catties. In addition, the combined amount of scallions, garlic, bean sprouts, spinach, radishes, chives, and tofu was only about 100 catties, with each person eating only about one tael per day. The total weight of vegetables used by the whole family throughout the year was about 400 catties, with each person eating only three or four taels per day, or one or two taels per meal. Malianwa was a large village producing many vegetables, but the laborers who grew the vegetables themselves could not afford to eat enough vegetables. Today, a five-person household uses about 1,500 catties of vegetables annually, about three to four times the amount used by a household of the same size in the past. Chinese cabbage accounts for the largest proportion. In addition, commonly eaten fresh vegetables include cucumbers, eggplants, tomatoes, radishes, spinach, and more than twenty other kinds. The proportion of each type varies greatly depending on the different preferences of each family, unlike the monotonous diet of the past. Many families often eat several kinds of homemade pickled vegetables, using about 200 catties a year. Today, ordinary people in vegetable-producing areas can eat more green vegetables than they could in the past.

    Condiments:  In the past, edible oil accounted for the largest proportion of the condiment expenses of a five-person household, as much as six-tenths of the total condiment expenses; salt was second, accounting for about three-tenths; soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, peppercorns, and other items accounted for one-tenth. The whole family used about 30 catties of salt a year. Sesame oil was the most common type of edible oil, followed by lard, mutton fat, soy sauce, shrimp oil, and other types, totaling about 10 catties a year. Each person only consumed about one mace (0.11 oz) of oil per day, and some families did not even get a few drops a day. Today, a family of the same size uses a fixed amount of 15 catties of sesame oil and peanut oil, as well as 20-30 catties of lard, mutton fat, soy sauce, sesame paste, etc. A family uses as much as 70 catties of salt a year, mostly for making sauces and pickling vegetables. About 50 catties of soy sauce and 20 catties of vinegar are used, and some even exceed this amount. Some "luxury goods" that were rarely bought in the past are now gradually being purchased, such as eating a few catties of sugar a year. As for seasonings such as peppercorns and star anise, they can be bought whenever desired. In the past, people felt good as long as they filled their stomachs with coarse food, but now not only is the rice and flour more palatable than before, but even the vegetables taste better and better.

    Meat:  In the past, ordinary farmers were so poor that eating a meal with meat was called "celebrating the New Year," which was a great satisfaction. From my repeated door-to-door inquiries in the past, I am very clear that the vast majority of families, except for the Spring Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Dragon Boat Festival, could hardly eat meat throughout the year, and some only ate meat on New Year's Eve. However, almost every family raised pigs at that time. Today, it is not surprising for an ordinary family to eat 20-30 catties of pork a year, and they may even eat a few catties of beef and mutton, a few catties of fish and shrimp, or a few chickens and ducks. I asked a housewife whether she ate more meat in 1956 than the year before. The answer was: "If it weren't so difficult to buy meat, of course we would eat more."

    Not only meat, but also dozens of eggs laid by the family's chickens are willingly used by the family, especially for the children. The comparison of other foods used in the past and present, such as fruits, snacks, and even cow and goat milk, are also obviously different. The comparison of the quantity and quality of nutrients contained in the food used in the past and present is even more worth mentioning, but due to limited space, I have to reluctantly omit it.

    (2) Clothing

    In the past, if an ordinary five-person household bought 30 chi (approx. 30 feet) of coarse cloth a year, it would average only six chi per person. Although this was far from meeting the needs of everyone, it might be considered "better than some, but not as good as others." Generally, people bought old clothes, old shoes, and old hats from peddlers selling scraps inside and outside Beijing, using them as needed in the most needed seasons, except for some shoes and socks made at home. Often, people would take off their single pants and put on quilted cotton pants, wearing them until the warm season of the following year when they would switch back to single pants. These families tried to get donated cotton clothes every year. Today, a five-person household can buy nearly 150 chi of ordinary cloth a year, mostly in blue, followed by white and blue, and then more attractive categories such as prints, plaids, and stripes. In addition, some families buy better cloth such as twill and serge according to their needs and preferences. Today, there is no need to buy scraps to wear. Instead, they can choose ready-made clothing such as socks, undershirts, shirts, sanitary clothes, skirts, hats, and uniforms that suit their wishes. More than 90% of the people in Guajiatun village have someone in their family who wears leather shoes and sneakers, and almost every young person has a uniform, and young women wear "four-eye" shoes. The quantity and quality of clothes worn in the past and present are very different, just like food.

    (3) Housing and Furniture

    In the past, in terms of housing and furniture, due to the fact that the old gardens and residences of Yuan Shikai's family in Guajiatun village had more than 200 rooms for rent, an ordinary family mostly rented two rooms, with only some dilapidated utensils inside. The bedding on the kang (heated brick bed) was mostly one or two decades old, providing warmth impartially. The strings of saw teeth on the ancient teapots and bowls well represented the traditional virtue of thrift. Of course, this was better than the "bare walls" and "no place to stand" in the surrounding villages, and even better than those who had no home to return to. Today, a five-person household mostly lives in their own three rooms, planting some flowers and grass in the yard and some green vegetables on their private plots. Bamboo curtains hang at the door. What makes me feel a little lost is that the "door gods" are gone. Cold cloth is pasted on the windows, and shiny glass is also installed. New mats are laid on the new kang. New life paintings are pasted on the walls, but I can't say "long time no see" to the "Kitchen God" and "God of Wealth" that I saw in the past. A new-style stove stands on the floor in the house; new porcelain bowls and plates are placed in the cabinets; teapots, teacups, tea canisters, porcelain washbasins, mouthwash cups, soapboxes, toothpaste, snow cream, face cream, thermos bottles, wine pots, ink bottles, paper, and pens are placed on the tables and desks; clean towels hang on the rope, and umbrellas stand in the corner. Sometimes you can also see flashlights, bicycles, or other things that were relatively rare in the past. Here, I must mention that on the first day I arrived in the village this time, I happened to come to the Cheng family, who used to belong to the poor peasants. As soon as I entered the street gate, I saw the blooming flowers and plants and the clean yard across the street. Then, the hostess led me into the room and sat me down by the Eight Immortals table. When she went to prepare tea, I glanced around the room, and I couldn't help but feel unusually (the "norm" of past impressions) and respect. I felt that every corner I looked at was good. The layers of bedding at the corner of the kang were stacked so well, and the various pieces of furniture were arranged so well. In short, the room was neat, tidy, and clean. This extraordinary feeling of mine is not surprising, because in my life I have never encountered and never thought I would be able to see the face of such a poor peasant family in this area. No matter what others think, as far as I am concerned, this simple beauty really makes me marvel, and also makes me understand that this is not just a change in superficial form, but also a fundamental change in substance. Just as the hostess was talking about how her family had changed from a poor peasant to today's wonderful situation, her child came home from school. As soon as he entered the door, he took off his clean coat, folded it neatly, and put on an older one. The mother smiled and said: "The children today are so sensible, I didn't tell him to do this. If it weren't for liberation, how could five children, even girls, have gone to school!" This deep first impression opened the door for me to understand the new face of today's countryside from the very beginning, so that all kinds of old impressions left over from the past quickly gave way and said goodbye.

    (4) Fuel

    In the past, a five-person household mostly burned straw and firewood picked up in the wild. In winter, they had to buy a few catties of briquettes to cook and heat the house. During the long days of the month, they tried to use as little kerosene as possible, only lighting the small kerosene lamp for a while during the long nights of winter, and turning the light down as low as possible, using one or two catties of oil per month. They used about 100 boxes of matches a year, and at that time there were still money-saving methods of using fire chains to make fire. Today, a five-person household uses several thousand catties of straw and firewood, as well as about 3,000 catties of briquettes and coal, so that they won't freeze their hands and feet in winter like they used to. Regarding lighting, some households in Guajiatun have already used electric lights. Families that use kerosene lamps need about 15 catties of oil per year. Due to the increasing number of people going to school and becoming literate, the amount of oil used has also increased accordingly. The annual cost of matches is as high as four or five hundred boxes, most of which are used on the pipes of two or three people in the family, and ordinary people often smoke more than twenty bags a day.

    (5) Medical Care and Hygiene

    In the past, ordinary families mostly could not afford to hire a doctor, pay for medicine, or pay attention to hygiene, so spending on this area was insignificant. There were families that did not even use soap all year round. Dirty clothes were mostly washed on stones by the river. Today, due to the great improvement in economic ability and knowledge, more attention is paid to medical care and hygiene. Many ordinary families spend as much as twenty or thirty yuan on medical expenses throughout the year, and many exceed this amount. An old man said to me with a smile: "People today are so delicate! They go to the doctor even for minor illnesses. The medical station has both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, which is very convenient. They even find illnesses in healthy people! There are even more things for pregnant women, and every child born is healthy. Anyway, Chairman Mao has a way, no one will starve." Regarding soap and alkali related to hygiene, many families buy thirty or forty bars a year. Most young people have the habit of brushing their teeth. Public hygiene is also obviously much better than in the past.

    (6) Tobacco, Alcohol, and Tea

    In the past, ordinary families rarely drank tea, except when occasionally entertaining relatives and friends, using only about one catty of tea dregs a year. Most families had one or two people who smoked tobacco leaves, using about ten catties a year. A very small number of families had people who drank a little alcohol, using three or four catties a year. Today, ordinary families can afford to drink tea, using about three or four catties a year. It is common for two or three people in a family to smoke, using about twenty catties of tobacco leaves a year, and some smoke more than fifty packs of cigarettes. Families that drink alcohol on weekdays are still a minority.

    (7) Culture and Education

    In the past, except for wealthy families such as landlords and rich peasants, ordinary families could not afford to send their children to school. Today, all school-age children in every family can go to school, and adults also have the opportunity to become literate. Almost every household is a family of farming and reading. The annual expenditure on culture and education is about twenty yuan. Guajiatun already has families that have purchased radios. The Oriental Society's library has more than 6,000 books. In the past, the leisure life of working people was very monotonous. Due to the pressure of making a living, they couldn't take care of entertainment, let alone spend money on leisure activities. Today, they watch movies, listen to operas, and participate in various recreational activities more and more frequently, and they also have the ability to buy tickets, and the entertainment they enjoy is beneficial to their physical and mental health. The unfortunate events of being lured into gambling and losing all their wages, which used to happen, no longer occur. Each agricultural production cooperative has its own club.

    (8) Socializing with Relatives and Friends and Other Expenses

    In the past, various social obligations to relatives and friends were an unavoidable burden in the daily life of an ordinary family, costing one or two silver dollars a year. Today, the economic ability of ordinary families to interact with others has greatly improved compared to the past, costing about ten to twenty yuan in Renminbi a year.

    In the past, an ordinary household spent about half a silver dollar a year on incense for the Kitchen God and the God of Wealth, paper for ancestors, and vows made for patients. Today, very few families still have these expenses. Most families have shifted from believing in gods and ghosts to believing in their own labor.

    (9) Relationships Between Family Members

    Within these families, due to the great changes in the economic relations and material living conditions between family members, the spiritual life has also been renewed. What I have particularly realized is that the relationship between people has also changed greatly. Today, a new type of family is increasingly emerging in these villages. In the past, in these households, especially in families with relationships such as mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law, most of them had disharmonious relationships. Family life and production suffered greatly. Today, harmonious and beautiful families are in the majority. Old sayings that used to be popular in these villages, such as "Three years of evil treatment, a lifetime of good treatment," "If the sister-in-law is not virtuous, grab a handful of salt," "There are no wrong parents in the world," "Three obediences and four virtues," and "One daughter is two thieves, two daughters are three thieves," are no longer valid today. The reason is very simple. People in the family, regardless of gender, can participate in production, earn work points, and have economic ability, so each family member can get his or her due status, respect, and warmth. This forward-developing harmonious family is an important favorable condition for improving labor productivity and improving family life.

    (10) Comparison and Analysis of Total Family Living Expenses

    Concrete facts prove that today, all aspects of these families' lives have greatly improved compared to the past. Exactly how much has the total amount of living expenses actually enjoyed today increased compared to the past? Taking the poor peasant households, which accounted for the largest number of households in the past, the total amount of living expenses for these families today has increased by about two-fifths compared to the past, and some have even doubled (when comparing, the impact of monetary inflation has been removed). Many of the original poor peasants and farm laborers have become new middle peasants after the land reform and are now enjoying a life that they find very satisfactory. Regarding the comparison between the past and present, an old lady surnamed Liu said these few words: "Why mention the past, anyway, it was just suffering! Then it was hell, and now it's heaven!" In her vocabulary, what could express her satisfaction more vividly than this? This visit realized that the increase in living expenses of the original middle peasants was not as much as that of the poor peasants and farm laborers. The increase in the living expenses of the rich peasants was even less. Today, the living standards of hard-working landlord families are not lower than in the past. The living standards of families of various components are becoming increasingly close, especially the boundaries between the poor, hired, and middle peasants are becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish. However, among the original rich peasants, some may have higher living standards due to better foundations and sufficient labor in the family. Since the abolition of land dividends, the income of some families who were relatively wealthy in the past has decreased, and if the family's labor force is also relatively poor, the living standards will be lower than average; families with a relatively weak labor force but a small population can still maintain a good life. It is clear that labor has become the main source of family living expenses today. From the overall perspective of these villages, the living standards of these residents are generally rising together, moving towards a future that is not limited to a comfortable life, but is becoming increasingly prosperous.

    北京郊区乡村家庭生活的今昔	李景汉
    （续昨）
    实际生活程度的今昔对比
    为了力求清楚、醒目而又能够做到较为细致准确地比较起见，让我以一个常见的普通户、不大不小的五口之家作为今昔生活对照的测量单位。这就是把调查过的大小家庭里面有关生活用途的量值都合成这一单位的量值（类似折合家中一切性别、年龄不同的人口等于多少“等成年男子”的方法）。这个五口之家包括一对壮年夫妇和他们的六至十二岁之间的一个男孩和一个女孩，及一位五十岁以上的老年父亲或母亲。为了在货币上能够比较起见，本文中除特别提明系过去使用的银元外，都是以现用人民币为单位。“昔日”大致系指做过京郊生活调查较多的前三十年的时期。按购买力来说，当年的银币一元约等于1956年的人民币二元六角二分，或1956年的人民币一元等于1926年的银币三角八分。本文所用货币数字都折合过了，所用度量衡也都折合为现用单位计算。
    （1）食品
    米面　这些乡村家庭的日常消费中，以食品占主要部分，而食品中以米面为主要部分。昔日一个普通的五口之家，全年约用米面一千八百斤，每月约用一百五十斤。其中粗粮约占95％以上，包括玉米面、小米、小米面、荞麦面、高粱和豆类。所吃细粮，包括白米和白面，仅约占5％以下。挂甲屯是产米之村，而种稻的农民反倒吃不到大米，在一年内仅吃到十几次白米饭而已。许多家庭在冷季多吃些白薯，一年用到一千多斤。几乎天天的饭食总离不开窝窝头、小米粥，或在里面加上些菜帮子、老倭瓜野菜等类的东西。不少的极贫户连这样很低的生活程度也达不到。今日的五口之家，在全年所用近二千斤的米面中，细粮约占60％，粗粮约占40％。细粮中白米占60％强，白面40％弱。
    菜蔬　在这些家庭的食品中次要者为菜蔬。昔日的五口之家最常吃的是腌萝卜、水咯哒、咯哒缨（即芥菜）、辣椒等几种咸菜，年用一百多斤，每口约合二十多斤，每人每日仅合一两。连北京人最常吃的白菜，在这些家庭内一年也只约用二百多斤，每人仅吃四十多斤。此外，葱、蒜、豆芽、菠菜、萝卜、韭菜、豆腐等合在一起，也不过一百多斤，每人每日仅吃到一两左右。全家全年所用菜蔬的总重量约计四百多斤，每人每日仅合三、四两，每餐一、二两。马连洼本是一个产菜很多的大村，但是亲自种菜的一般劳动者却吃不到够用的菜。今日的五口之家，一年所用菜蔬总量约达一千五百斤之多，约等于昔日同样大小之家用菜量的三、四倍。白菜的比重占第一位。此外常吃的鲜菜有黄瓜、茄子、西红柿、萝卜、菠菜等二十余种之多。每种数量所占的比重，按照各家人口不同的爱好、选择就很有出入，不像昔日彼此差不多的那样单调了。很多家里常吃自腌的几种咸菜，一家一年约用二百斤。在今日出菜区的普通人家，比在昔日能吃到更多的青菜了。
    调和　昔日的五口之家所用的调和费中，食油居首位，竟占调和总费用的十分之六；盐次之，约占十分之三；酱、醋、姜、花椒等物合占十分之一。全家一年用盐约三十余斤。食油中以香油为最多，外有猪油、羊油、酱油、虾油等类，合计一年约十余斤。每人每天仅合一钱重的油，且有些家一天连几滴也吃不到。在今日，同样大小的一家，全年除用定量的十五斤香油和花生油外，还用二、三十斤猪油、羊油、酱油、芝麻酱等。一家全年用盐竟达七十多斤，除平常吃外，多用作酱和腌菜。用酱约五十斤，醋约二十斤，且有远超过此数者。昔日极少买的一些“奢侈品”，在今日也渐渐购用起来了，例如一年内肯吃糖几斤。至于花椒、大料等作料是想买就买的。从前只要把粗食填满肚皮就觉着混的不错，而现在不但吃的米面比从前大为顺口，连吃的菜也越来越有香味儿了。
    肉类　昔日一般的农民是那样穷苦，只要遇机会吃上一顿肉，就称为“过年”，也就是一次很大的满足。从我过去挨户反复的询问里，很清楚的熟悉：绝大多数的人家，除春节、中秋和端午三节外，几乎一年到头吃不着肉，甚至有的仅在除夕吃到肉，可是，当时几乎每家都养猪。今天的一个普通家庭，一年内吃到二、三十斤猪肉是无足怪的，而且也许还能吃上几斤牛羊肉、几斤鱼虾或几只鸡鸭呢。曾问过一个内当家的：1956年是否比前年吃的肉更多一些。回答是：“要不是这么难买到肉的话，当然要多”。
    不仅是肉类，连家里鸡下的蛋一年内也舍得自己用几十个了，尤其是给小孩吃。关于今昔所用其他食品的对比，如水果、闲食，甚至牛羊奶等方面也都显然不同。今昔所用食物里面所含滋养料的量质对比更值得提及，但篇幅有限，只得割爱。
    （2）衣服
    昔日的一个普通五口之家，如果一年添购三十尺粗布，平均每口仅合六尺，虽然远不够一切人口的需要，说不定也算已“比上不足、比下有余”了。一般的人家，除部分鞋袜在家做外，就在京城内外卖破烂儿的摊子上买旧衣裳、旧鞋帽，将就着用于最需要的季节。往往人们刚脱下单裤就穿上空心棉裤，一直穿到次年的暖季才又换上单裤。这类人家每年争取得到施舍的棉衣。今日的一个五口之家，一年中可购用近一百五十尺的普通布，其中以青色者为最多，白、蓝色次之，再次为印花、格、条等较漂亮些的品类。此外，有的人家按照自己需要和爱好的不同，还加购些斜纹、哔叽等类较好的布。今日无须寻买破烂儿穿了，而是恰恰相反，能够选购称自己心愿的织袜、汗衫、衬衣、卫生衣、裙子、帽子、制服等现成的衣着了。挂甲屯村中90％以上的人家里有人穿上了皮鞋、球鞋等物，且几乎每个青年都有制服，女青年穿着四眼鞋。在今昔所穿衣服的量、质上，同食品一样，也大不相同。
    （3）房屋和家具
    昔日在居住和家具方面，在挂甲屯村由于当时袁世凯家的旧花园和苑宅两处有二百多间的屋子出租，一个普通家庭，多是租住两间屋子，里面仅有一些破旧的用具。炕上的被褥多半具有一二十年的资历，且发挥其一视同仁的温暖。古老壶碗上一串串的锯齿，很能表示出传统的节约美德。这当然比这一带乡村里“家徒壁立”、“贫无立锥”，甚至无家可归的人们还好一些。今日的五口之家，多是住着自己的三间屋子，在院里种些花草和自留地上种些青菜。门口挂着竹帘。使我若有所失的，是“门神爷”不见了。窗上糊着冷布，也安着亮晶晶的玻璃。新炕席上又铺着新凉席。墙上贴着新生活的画，但我不能向昔日所见的“灶王爷”、“财神爷”道一声“久违”了。屋内地面上立着新式的火炉；橱柜里放着些新磁碗、盘碟等物；几案上摆着茶壶、茶碗、茶叶罐、磁脸盆、漱口盂、胰子盒、牙膏、雪花膏、润面油、暖水瓶、酒壶、墨水瓶、纸、笔；绳子上悬着几条干净毛巾，墙角立着雨伞。也有时看见手电筒、自行车或其他昔日比较稀罕的东西。在此，我不能不提一提当我这次到村内的第一个白天里，首先碰巧来到的一个原属贫农的程家。一进街门，就看见对面盛开的花草和清洁的院子。随后主妇把我让到室内，坐在八仙桌旁。当她去预备茶水，我向室内扫了几眼的时候，我不禁感觉异常（系昔日印象的“常”）而起敬。我看到哪一个角落，就觉哪一个角落好。炕角一层层的被褥叠的那么好，各种的家具安置的那么好。总之，屋内整整齐齐、干干净净。我的这一超乎寻常的感觉也是无足怪的，因为在我一生中我从未碰到过也没想到过能够在这一带村庄里见到像这样一个贫农家庭的面貌。不管别人怎样想法，仅以我个人而论，这种朴素的美好，真使我叹观止矣，也使我理解到这不只是表面形式的变化，而也是根本的实质的变化。当主人谈到她家如何从一个贫农变到今天这样美好境况的当儿，正赶上她的孩子下学回家，一进屋门就把他的整洁上衣脱下叠好，换一件较旧的。母亲笑着说：“现在的孩子真懂事，我没告诉过他这样做。要不是解放，哪能五个孩子、连女孩都上了学！”这一先入为主的深刻印象，从一开始就给我打开了认识今日农村新面貌的门，使从昔日留下的种种旧印象都很快的一一让位而告别了。
    （4）燃料
    昔日的五口之家，多烧秸秆和野外拾的柴草。在冬季得添购几斤煤球做饭，带暖屋子。在昼长的月份尽量少点小煤油灯，仅在夜长的冬季每日才点一会儿，也把灯火捻得小小的，每月用油一二斤。全年约用火柴一百多盒，当时仍有使用火链打火的省钱方法。今日的五口之家，全家除用秸秆、柴草几千斤外，约用煤球、煤块三千斤，不致在冬季像从前冻手冻脚的了。关于照明，挂甲屯的一部分住户已用电灯。用煤油灯的人家全年需油约十五斤。由于上学和识字的人数越来越多，因之用油量也随之增加了。每年所费火柴达四五百盒之多，其中大部分是用在家内两三口人的烟袋锅上，普通每日每人常抽二十多袋。
    （5）医药卫生
    昔日一般人家多半请不起医生，拿不出药费，也讲不起卫生，因之对这方面的消费是微不足道的。有一年到头连胰子也不用的家庭。脏衣裳多在河边石头上砸洗。今日由于经济能力和知识的大为提高，对医药卫生都随之大为注意了。不少的普通人家，全年医药费竟达二三十元之多，还有不少超过此数者。一个老汉笑着对我说：“今儿的人可娇气喽！有点儿小病也去看大夫。医疗站又有中医又有西医，可方便啦，他们在好人身上还找病呢！对孕妇事儿更多啦，家家生的孩子都是好好儿的。反正毛主席有办法儿，饿不着一个人”。和讲求卫生有关的胰子与碱，许多人家一年内购用三、四十块。大部分青年都有了刷牙习惯。公共卫生也显然比昔日好得多了。
    （6）烟酒茶
    昔日的平常人家，除偶尔招待亲友外，喝茶的次数极少，全年不过用上一斤茶叶末儿。家内多半有一两个人抽烟叶，一年约用十斤。极少数的人家内有喝点儿酒的人，一年用三、四斤。今日的普通人家都喝得起茶了，一年约用三、四斤。家内有两三个人吸烟是常见的，一年用烟叶约二十斤，也有吸五十多盒纸烟的。平日饮酒的家庭仍占少数。
    （7）文化教育
    昔日除地主富农等富裕人家外，普通家里的儿童是上不起学的。今日家家的学龄儿童都能入学，大人也都有识字的机会。几乎户户是耕读之家了。全年为文化教育支出的费用约二十多元。挂甲屯已经有购置收音机的家庭了。东方社的图书室有书六千多册。昔日劳动人民的业余生活是很单调的，由于为生计所迫，顾不到娱乐，更谈不到出钱的消遣。今日他们看电影、听戏、参加各种文娱活动的次数越来越多，也有了买票的能力，且所享受的娱乐都是对身心有益的，不再发生从前那种被引诱去赌博、把工资输光的不幸事件。各农业生产合作社都有了自己的俱乐部。
    （8）亲友应酬及其它
    从前对于亲友、邻舍的种种应酬，在一普通之家是日常生活中一项不易免的负担，一年得花一两元银币。今日的一般人家对人情往来上比昔日的经济能力大为提高，全年约用人民币一二十元。
    从前一个普通户为灶王和财神烧的香、为祖先烧的纸、为病人许的愿等花销，一年约用银币半元。今日极少的人家尚有这类费用。一般的人家都由信仰鬼神而转变到信仰自己的劳动力了。
    （9）家庭成员之间的关系
    在这些家庭里面，由于家庭成员间的经济关系和物质生活的面貌大有改变，精神生活亦随之面貌一新。使我特别理会到的，是人与人之间的关系亦因之大为改观。今日在这些村庄里，正在日益增加着一种新型家庭。从前在这些住户里，尤其是在有婆媳、妯娌、姑嫂等关系的人家里，闹人口不和的占大多数。家庭生活和生产都受了很不利的影响。在今日，和睦的、和美的家庭占多数了。昔日的“恶使三年，善使一辈子”、“小姑不贤，抓把盐”、“天下没有不是的父母”、“三从四德”、“一个女儿两个贼，两个女儿三个贼”等流行在这些村庄里的老话，在今天都失效了。理由很简单，家里的人口，不分男女都能参加生产，挣工分，有经济能力了，因之每一家庭成员就可能得到他或她应得的地位、尊重和温暖。这种向前发展着的和谐家庭，对于劳动生产率的提高和家庭生活的改善是重要的有利条件。
    （10）家庭生活费用总数的对比和分析
    具体的事实证明了：今日这些家庭生活的各方面都比昔日大大改善了。究竟今日实际享受的生活费用总数比昔日提高了多少呢？以昔日占总户数最多的贫农户而论，今日这类家庭的全年生活费总数比昔日增加了五分之二左右，其中有的高到一倍以上（在对比时把货币膨胀因素的影响除开了）。许多原来的贫雇农，在土地改革以后变成新中农，现在享受着自己觉得很满意的生活。对于今昔的对照，一位刘老太太说了这样几句话：“还提从前干什么呀，反正就是苦罢！那会儿是地狱，这会儿是天堂！”在她的辞汇中，还能找出什么比这个更能鲜明的表达出她的满足心情呢？这次访问理会到，原来中农的生活费的增加不如贫雇农增加的多。富农生活费的增加更比较少些。今日肯劳动的地主成份家庭的生活水平并不比昔日降低。各种成份的家庭生活程度日益接近，尤其是贫、雇和中农的界限越来越不易分了。但在原来的富农中，有的由于底子好些，且家中又有充足的劳动力，现在的生活享受可能比较高些。自土地分红取消以后，在原来比较富裕的人家中，有的家庭收入减少了一些，如果家里的劳动力又比较差些的话，则生活水平就比一般要低一点儿；劳动力虽比较弱但人口比较少的家庭，还可以维持不错的生活。很清楚的情况是，劳动力成为今天家庭生活费用的主要来源了。从这几个乡村的整体来看，这些居民的生活水平大致是一齐的上升的，共同向着不止于小康，而是日益富裕的前程迈进。　（未完）
