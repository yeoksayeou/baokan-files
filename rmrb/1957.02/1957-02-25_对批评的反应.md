Reaction to Criticism

    The Office of the Shijiazhuang Commissioner's Office in Hebei Province wrote: The People's Daily on February 12th, page 4, criticized the wasteful phenomenon of our lavish banquets to entertain the visiting comfort groups and medical teams working in our region. We are willing to sincerely accept this criticism, and in conjunction with the current campaign to increase production and practice economy, we will examine and improve our work and resolutely plug loopholes in this area.

    对批评的反应
    河北石家庄专员公署办公室来信：2月12日人民日报第四版批评我们大摆酒席招待来我专区工作的慰问团、医疗队的浪费现象。我们愿意诚恳接受这种批评，并结合目前增产节约运动检查改进我们的工作，坚决堵塞这方面的漏洞。
