Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: American newspapers reveal that the purpose of the U.S. government's plan to support Israel is to attempt to use the free navigation of the Gulf of Aqaba to establish another important oil transportation route in the Middle East through Israel, in order to facilitate the United States' plunder of Middle Eastern oil resources.

American newspapers published news on the 13th revealing Dulles's plan, saying that it had been suggested to build an oil pipeline from Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba through Israel to the Israeli port of Haifa on the Mediterranean Sea. "This would break Egypt and Syria's economic stranglehold on Europe."

United Press International (UPI) reported from Washington on the 13th that U.S. officials admitted that "as far as U.S. policy is concerned, the American proposal (to support free navigation of the Gulf of Aqaba) does contain an important new element."

The news agency said that in the past, U.S. government spokesmen agreed that the Gulf of Aqaba was an "international waterway," but the United States cautiously avoided participating in the dispute caused by Egypt's blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba against Israel. Now, Washington officials say that the United States intends to actively participate in establishing the international nature of the Gulf of Aqaba. They say the United States intends to exercise this right itself.

According to UPI, the U.S. plan is that if Israeli troops withdraw from Egyptian territory, the United States intends to send ships to Israel's port of Eilat. U.S. officials believe that "this will establish the international nature of this waterway through convention, and if Egypt wants to reimplement the blockade, it will find this practice politically dangerous."

At the same time, UPI also reported that some U.S. officials in Washington believe that the U.S. plan "seems unworkable." They said that for political reasons, it is impossible to transport Saudi Arabian oil to Israeli ports, and it is also very difficult to transport oil from the British protectorates of Kuwait and Bahrain. They believe that if necessary, Iranian oil can be transported through Israel, but they emphasized the technical difficulties of reorganizing the supply system.

### 美国支持以色列的自私目的  企图利用亚喀巴湾另建输油路线

    美国支持以色列的自私目的
    企图利用亚喀巴湾另建输油路线
    据新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国报纸透露，美国政府支持以色列的计划的目的，是企图利用亚喀巴湾的自由通航在中东建立另外一条贯穿以色列的重要输油路线，以便于美国掠夺中东的石油资源。
    美国报纸在13日刊载透露杜勒斯计划的这一企图的消息说，曾经有人建议从亚喀巴湾上的埃拉特穿过以色列建筑一条输油管道，到地中海上以色列港口海法。“这样将会突破埃及和叙利亚对欧洲经济的束缚”。
    合众社记者13日从华盛顿报道说，美国官员们承认，“就美国政策而言，美国（支持亚喀巴湾自由通航）的建议里的确包含着一种重要的新因素”。
    这家通讯社说，过去美国政府的发言人同意亚喀巴湾是一条“国际性水道”，但是美国谨慎地避免参与埃及对以色列封锁亚喀巴湾而引起的争执。现在，华盛顿的官员们说，美国打算积极参预确立亚喀巴湾国际性质的工作。他们说，美国自己也打算行使这种权利。
    据合众社说，美国的计划是，如果以色列军队从埃及领土撤出，美国就打算派船只到以色列的埃拉特港去。美国官员认为，“这样就能通过惯例把这条水道的国际性质旨定下来，埃及如果想重新实行封锁，就会发现这种做法在政治上很危险”。
    合众社同时又报道说，华盛顿有一些美国官员认为美国的计划“似乎是行不通的”。他们说，由于政治上的原因，要把沙特阿拉伯的石油运到以色列港口是不可能的，要运出英国保护地科威特和巴林的石油也非常困难。他们认为，如果必要的话，伊朗的石油是可以通过以色列运出的，但是，他们又强调指出改组供应系统在技术上的困难。
