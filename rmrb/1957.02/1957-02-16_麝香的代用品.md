    Musk Substitute

    Xinhua News Agency report: A substitute for the precious traditional Chinese medicine musk has been preliminarily trial-produced by engineer Yuan Shaoyi and others at the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Factory. Preliminary tests have shown that the trial-produced musk substitute has the same excitatory reflex and bactericidal effects as natural musk.

    The main raw material for this musk substitute trial-produced by Yuan Shaoyi and others is extracted from the leaves of Chinese arborvitae and other pine and cypress trees, which are traditional Chinese medicines. They are now further researching how to make its fragrance closer to natural musk, in order to meet the testing requirements of traditional practices.

    Musk has a wide range of uses, and many Chinese medicines for treating wind-phlegm, children's diseases, and other conditions require musk. However, the source of natural musk is scarce. According to staff at the well-known traditional Chinese medicine store Tongrentang, due to the lack of musk, more than sixty famous proprietary medicines, such as "Liushen Pills" and "Angong Niuhuang Pills," cannot be prepared.

    麝香的代用品
    据新华社讯　名贵中药麝香的代用品已经由天津制药厂工程师袁少逸等初步试制成功。初步的试验证明，试制的这种麝香代用品和天然麝香具有同样的兴奋反射、杀菌等作用。
    袁少逸等人试制的这种麝香代用品的主要原料是从中药侧柏叶等松柏叶子中提炼出来的，现在他们正在进一步研究使它的香味能够更近于天然麝香，以符合传统习惯的检定要求。
    麝香的用途很广，中药治疗风痰、小儿病等方面的许多药品都需要麝香。但是天然麝香的来源少。据著名的中药店同仁堂的工作人员说，由于麝香的缺乏，已经有“六神丸”、“安宫牛黄丸”等六十多种有名的成药不能配制。
