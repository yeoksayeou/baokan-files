    East Asian Monsoon
    Gao Youxi
    A monsoon, also known as a seasonal wind, refers to a significant change in wind direction with the changing seasons. In meteorology, the seasonal change of wind direction caused by the seasonal variation of thermal differences between land and sea, with winds blowing from the continent to the ocean in winter and from the ocean to the continent in summer, is often called a monsoon. In the case of East Asia, the Asian continent is colder than the Pacific Ocean in winter. The accumulation of cold air on the continent forms a high-pressure area in the Mongolian region, while the air over the Pacific Ocean rises due to heating, forming a low-pressure area in the Aleutian region. On the rotating Earth, when cold air flows from the Mongolian high-pressure area to the oceanic low-pressure area, it deflects into northwest or northeast winds, which are the winter monsoon. The situation is reversed in summer, with the temperature of the Pacific Ocean lower than that of the East Asian continent. The Pacific high-pressure area strengthens, and the thermal low-pressure on the continent also intensifies. Therefore, southerly southwest and southeast winds are formed from the ocean to the continent, which are the summer monsoon. The winter monsoon originates from the continent, and the summer monsoon comes from the ocean, so the air properties are very different. Therefore, not only are the climates completely different under the control of a single winter monsoon or a single summer monsoon, but their strength, the timing of their arrival and departure, and the circumstances of their interaction essentially determine the weather and climate of different seasons in East Asia.
    In discussing the weather and climate of East Asia, we must not ignore the study of this monsoon problem, which is rich in regional characteristics.
    Just one example is enough to illustrate the importance of the East Asian monsoon to the national economy. South of the Yellow River, including the entire Yangtze River basin and most of South China, is under the control of subtropical high pressure. These areas are where the major deserts of the earth—the Arabian Desert, the Sahara Desert, and the deserts of Iran, Afghanistan, and northwestern India—appear in this latitude range. Without the influence of the monsoon, the year-round climate would inevitably be very hot and dry. The Yangtze River basin, now known as the granary of the motherland, would be a barren desert. Of course, it is also because of the monsoon that every year after the beginning of spring, the cool and humid summer monsoon from the ocean not only moderates the scorching summer climate, but also brings a large amount of rain to South China, Central China, and North China due to its abundant water vapor, which turns the originally barren desert area into a granary of the motherland with three or two harvests a year.
    For the climate, the monsoon phenomenon between the Eurasian continent and the Pacific Ocean is one of the foundations for the formation of the climate in the East Asian region. The monsoon factor produced by the difference in land-sea distribution is one of the decisive factors in the formation of atmospheric activity centers and seasonal changes. In winter, the temperature difference between the continent and the ocean determines the position, approximate intensity, and changes of the two semi-permanent atmospheric activity centers—the Mongolian high pressure and the Aleutian low pressure. In summer, the continent is warmer than the ocean, and the distribution of atmospheric activity centers determined by the monsoon factor is exactly the opposite of that in winter. A very developed Pacific high pressure appears over the Pacific Ocean, while the Indian thermal low pressure is particularly significant over the Asian continent. Spring and autumn are the transition seasons for the changes in land-sea thermal differences. In spring, the situation changes from the winter situation where the ocean is warmer than the continent to a season where it is colder than the continent. During this season, the Mongolian high pressure declines and becomes the Mongolian low pressure, and the Indian low pressure and the Pacific high pressure gradually replace the Aleutian low pressure. Autumn is a transition period from the summer situation where the ocean is colder than the continent to a period where it is warmer than the continent. It is also the process in which the Mongolian high pressure rapidly replaces the Mongolian low pressure and the Indian low pressure, and the Aleutian low pressure develops to regain dominance. In the same season, the location, distribution, and strength of these land-sea atmospheric activity centers, as well as their seasonal changes in different seasons, are basically the processes of the prevailing winter and summer monsoons and their seasonal changes. Therefore, it can be said that the distribution of atmospheric activity centers formed by monsoon factors maintains the monsoon phenomenon, and the appearance of the monsoon phenomenon in turn affects the semi-permanent atmospheric activity centers, which in turn affects the weather of the continent and the ocean, and determines the climate of East Asia.
    Although it is not yet possible to well link the seasonal changes of these atmospheric activity centers, which are closely related to monsoon factors, directly with the weather phenomena of the day or a short period of time and its changes, it can be believed that the seasonal changes of these activity centers determine the weather characteristics of different seasons in a certain region, that is, in the short-term weather, there must generally be traces of the monsoon. For example, in East Asia in winter, the thermal difference between land and sea is particularly large, and the role of the monsoon is particularly strong, so the Mongolian high pressure and the Aleutian low pressure are particularly developed. The pressure gradient between the Mongolian cold high pressure and the Aleutian low pressure causes the cold air from the continent to continuously invade the south. This southward invading cold high pressure is affected by monsoon factors and can stabilize on our mainland. Therefore, the cold high pressure forms the weather system that controls this period, and the weather characteristics of this period are cold and dry. After midwinter, the sun's radiation strengthens, and the heating on the continent is faster than that on the ocean. The thermal difference between land and sea first gradually decreases, and then becomes the opposite. Therefore, under the weakening effect of winter monsoon factors and the increasing effect of summer monsoon factors, the Mongolian high pressure on the continent and the Aleutian low pressure on the Pacific Ocean gradually weaken, while the Pacific high pressure and the continental low pressure gradually develop. Under this seasonal change, the winter monsoon originating from the continent weakens, while the summer monsoon originating from the ocean develops daily. Under the mutual impact of these winter and summer monsoons, the weather characteristics of spring, which are unpredictable with alternating sunshine and rain, cold and warmth, are formed. After spring, the ocean becomes colder than the continent, the continental low pressure replaces the winter Mongolian high pressure, and the Pacific high pressure replaces the Aleutian low pressure. Most of the Chinese mainland is under the control of the Indian low pressure and the Pacific high pressure, forming tropical and subtropical weather, which is characterized by sultry heat and many thunderstorms, and the changes in all meteorological elements are small. After midsummer, the continent cools rapidly, and the ocean turns warmer than the continent again. Monsoon factors cause the Indian low pressure and the Pacific high pressure on the continent to gradually weaken, while the Mongolian high pressure and the Aleutian low pressure gradually develop. The cold high pressure that rapidly moves southward from Mongolia and invades the Chinese mainland gradually becomes the main weather system of this season. Therefore, we say that in East Asia, if we ignore the role of the monsoon, we cannot have a more comprehensive understanding or explanation of the weather characteristics of different seasons in East Asia.
    Similarly, without studying the nature, structure, and activity of the East Asian monsoon, it is difficult to have a clearer understanding of the climate characteristics of East Asia, which are dry and cold in winter, hot and humid with abundant rain in summer, and changeable with sunshine and rain in spring and autumn. But after knowing the nature of the East Asian winter and summer monsoons and their mutual waxing and waning, it is easy to qualitatively explain these climate phenomena from the activity of the monsoon in different seasons. "Qualitative" must be emphasized, because there are many factors that form the climate of a region. The monsoon between land and sea is one of the factors. For East Asia, the monsoon factor may be very important, but whether it is the most important must be confirmed by many research works. This is another reason to emphasize the importance of studying the monsoon problem.
    For the formation of East Asian weather and climate, the study of this monsoon factor or monsoon phenomenon, which is one of the foundations (or even the most important one) of East Asian weather and climate, should not and cannot be ignored. That is, for long-term forecasts and seasonal forecasts of more than one month, this monsoon factor must also be taken seriously, because one of the main bases for long-term forecasts is the persistence of seasonal changes in atmospheric activity centers, and the formation and seasonal waxing and waning of atmospheric activity centers are directly and very closely related to the seasonal changes of monsoon factors.
    More importantly, in meteorology, when discussing certain atmospheric circulation or climate phenomena, there are often debates that emphasize thermal effects and emphasize dynamic effects. It is generally accepted that the direct north-south thermal exchange formed by the latitude difference of solar radiation is very important for the heat balance on the earth's surface, atmospheric circulation, and climate formation. However, there are very different views on the monsoon phenomenon formed by the distribution of land and sea, and the role of direct land-sea thermal exchange produced by it. Although there is currently not much and in-depth research, and therefore it is impossible to give a correct evaluation, the study of the monsoon problem as a direct thermal circulation will certainly allow people to further understand the impact of thermal effects on weather, climate, and atmospheric circulation.
    The importance of land-sea distribution monsoon factors is only for the generation of the monsoon phenomenon. The specific monsoon phenomenon is restricted by the atmospheric circulation and specific geographical conditions of the region. Therefore, the same land-sea monsoon factors, but expressed in the monsoon phenomena on the east and west coasts of the continent at the same latitude (Western Europe and East Asia), are obviously different. That is, even on the east coast of the same continent (for example, the eastern part of North America and the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent), due to the differences in the size and shape of the land-sea distribution and the differences in specific topography, the monsoon phenomena in North America and East Asia have differences in obviousness, simplicity, and complexity. Not only that, but even on the east coast of the same continent, the monsoon phenomenon will not be the same if the atmospheric circulation conditions are different. Southeast Asia and China are on the same east coast of the same continent, but the monsoon phenomena are not exactly the same. This illustrates two problems: first, the monsoon problem is very complex. This complexity will inevitably increase many difficulties in the study of the monsoon problem. That is to say, any simplified research will certainly not fit the actual situation well. Second, the monsoon phenomenon has extremely important regional characteristics. Therefore, although the causes of formation are consistent for the monsoons in North America, India, Africa, or East Asia, the expressed monsoon phenomena are very different.
    Therefore, when studying the East Asian monsoon problem, we must pay attention to the characteristics of the position of the East Asian monsoon phenomenon in the atmospheric circulation. The East Asian winter monsoon appears under the influence of the westerly circulation. Therefore, in the southern half of the Mongolian cold high pressure, the northwest monsoon or northeast monsoon caused by monsoon factors changes to westerly and southwest winds at an altitude of more than two kilometers. This is an extremely opposite change. Therefore, the monsoon and anti-monsoon in this region must be very clear and easy to distinguish. However, in the northern half of the cold high pressure, westerly winds prevail both on the ground and at high altitudes. Therefore, it is difficult to separate the monsoon part produced by the land-sea distribution from the westerly circulation, which increases the difficulty in studying the winter monsoon in this region. The summer monsoon appears in the equatorial westerly belt, the subtropical easterly belt, and the westerly belt, so the monsoon phenomenon must be intricate and complex. In South China and the South China Sea, south of the summer thermal equator, the southwest monsoon produced by the land-sea distribution is consistent with the southwest wind produced by the seasonal movement of the planetary wind system. Therefore, the southwest monsoon is quite deep, and the change of wind direction between the winter and summer monsoons is almost opposite. Therefore, it can be believed that the seasonal change of the monsoon in this region must be very obvious. North of the thermal equator and south of the subtropical high-pressure ridge, the eastern and southeastern coastal areas of China, due to the coast being nearly north-south, the south wind generated by the land-sea distribution coincides with the easterly belt caused by the seasonal changes of the planetary wind belt, forming the southeast monsoon in China. Therefore, it can be inferred that the southeast monsoon in this region must also be very deep. North of the subtropical high-pressure ridge, or in the border areas north of the Yellow River basin in China, the winter and summer are both under the influence of the westerly belt and are often disturbed by non-periodic pressure systems. Therefore, the winter and summer monsoons will not be stable, and their changes will not be obvious.
    Because the East Asian and Southeast Asian regions have different and similar atmospheric circulation locations, the monsoon phenomena also have differences or similarities. For example, in some parts of South China and the South China Sea, the nature, structure, and seasonal changes of the winter and summer monsoons should be similar to those in India. On the east coast of China, the seasonal change of land-sea influence is more obvious than on the east coast of the Indian Peninsula. Therefore, the change between the northeast monsoon in winter and the southeast monsoon in summer in China is more significant than in India. In summer, East Asia is under the influence of the equatorial westerly belt, the easterly belt, and the westerly belt, while India is under the control of a single equatorial westerly belt. The monsoon phenomena are fundamentally different in many aspects. Therefore, using the method of dealing with the Indian monsoon to study the East Asian monsoon phenomenon will certainly not get good results.
    When comparing the monsoon phenomena in North America and the Eurasian continent, it is often believed that the Eurasian continent is three to four times larger than the North American continent. Therefore, the monsoon phenomenon in the Eurasian continent should be three to four times more obvious than that in North America. We believe that a more reasonable consideration of the size of the land and sea should also take the African continent north of the equator into account. In this way, not only should the monsoon phenomenon in the Afro-Eurasian continent be four to five times more obvious than that in North America, but it is also easier to explain why the center of the Indian low pressure in midsummer is not in North Africa, but in Arabia. Because for a continent of this size, its center should not fall in Xinjiang, China, but should be in the Arabian Desert.
    Not only will the size of the land and sea affect the obviousness and stability of the monsoon, etc., but even if the land and sea are the same size but have different shapes, the monsoon phenomena will be different. The North American continent is mainly arranged in a north-south direction (60 degrees of latitude long north-south, and 35 degrees of longitude wide east-west), and the shape is wide in the north and narrow in the south, while the Afro-Eurasian continent is arranged in a near east-west direction, and is nearly equally wide in the north-south direction (nearly 150 degrees of longitude wide east-west, and nearly 70 degrees of latitude wide north-south). Precisely because of this difference, closed isotherms can appear at the same latitude due to the influence of land-sea distribution in both winter and summer on the Afro-Eurasian continent. The North American continent, however, is mainly west-east, and there are few closed isotherms. This difference will cause great differences in the monsoon phenomena in North America and the Afro-Eurasian continent.
    Also, because the west-east coastline of the Afro-Eurasian continent is more than three times longer than that of North America, this also stipulates that the transformation of the northeast monsoon to the southwest monsoon in Southeast Asia must be more obvious than in North America (North America does not have a southwest monsoon at all). Similarly, the main land distribution in North America is at high latitudes, while the Afro-Eurasian continent is mainly distributed at low latitudes. Therefore, the monsoon phenomenon in the latter is less affected by the westerly circulation than the former, which further increases the significance of the Afro-Eurasian monsoon phenomenon.
    There are also the characteristics of the large terrain. The monsoon phenomenon is a comprehensive phenomenon under the intricate influence of atmospheric circulation and specific underlying surface (in addition to land and sea, mainly terrain). The complexity of the terrain and the size of the plateau in East Asia are unparalleled in the world. The area of the plateau with an altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level accounts for 35% of China's area, 2,000 meters or more accounts for 33%, and 3,000 meters or more accounts for 16%. Not to mention the dynamic effect of the high and large Tibetan plateau barrier to the west on the monsoon; it can be imagined that the importance of such a large plateau in terms of thermal effects, if it has the role of cold and heat source for the surrounding free atmosphere, and the cold and heat source has seasonal changes, then it can be imagined that the East Asian monsoon is not only the result of temperature differences and seasonal changes between land and sea, but the airflow field formed by the temperature difference between the plateau and the free atmosphere at the same altitude and its relative changes will also increase the diversity and complexity of the East Asian monsoon. Without considering the characteristics of the large terrain, it may be impossible to explain some of the characteristics of the monsoon phenomenon.
    Therefore, once again emphasizing the importance of studying the East Asian monsoon is not only because it is a problem of fundamental significance in meteorology, but also because it is a characteristic of East Asian weather and climate—a characteristic that is difficult to compare with regions at the same latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. The meteorological workers of the motherland have a responsibility to study it.

    东亚季风
    高由禧
    季风又叫季候风，即风向随季节的不同发生显著改变的意思。在气象学上，常常把海陆之间热力差异的季节变化所引起的冬季从大陆吹向海洋、夏季从海洋吹向大陆的风向的季节变换叫做季风。就东亚来说，冬季亚洲大陆比太平洋冷，大陆上冷空气的堆积，形成蒙古地区的高气压，太平洋上的空气受热上升，形成阿留申地区的低气压；在自转的地球上，当冷空气从蒙古高气压流向海洋低气压时，偏转成西北风或东北风，即冬季季风。夏季的情况相反，太平洋的温度比东亚大陆的低，太平洋高气压增长，大陆的热低气压也强；因此，形成了从海洋向大陆偏南的西南风和东南风，即夏季季风。冬季季风起自大陆，夏季季风来自海洋，空气性质有很大不同；因此，不仅在单一冬季风或单一夏季风控制下的气候完全不同，它们的势力强弱，来去时间的早迟以及它们相互冲击的情况，基本上决定了东亚的各不同季节的天气和气候。
    在讨论东亚的天气和气候时，决不能忽略这一富有区域特征的季风问题的研究。
    仅仅举出一种情况就足以说明东亚季风对国民经济的重要性。黄河流域以南，包括整个长江流域和华南大部分地区，都在副热带的高气压控制下，这些地带是地球上的主要沙漠——阿拉伯沙漠、撒哈拉沙漠、伊朗、阿富汗和印度西北方的沙漠，都出现在这纬度范围上，如果没有季风的影响，常年气候必然非常干热，现在号称祖国谷仓的长江流域，将是一片不毛的沙漠。当然，也正是季风的关系，每年入春以后，从海洋来的凉湿的夏季风，不仅使夏季的酷热气候变得缓和，而且它的丰富的水汽量，也带给华南、华中和华北大量雨水，这就使本来应该是不毛的沙漠地区，变成了一年三熟或两熟的祖国的谷仓。
    对气候来说，欧亚大陆和太平洋间的季风现象是形成东亚地区气候的基础之一。海陆的分布差异所产生的季风因素，是形成大气活动中心和季节变化的决定因素之一。冬季，大陆海洋的温度差异，决定了两个半永久性的大气活动中心——蒙古高气压和阿留申低气压的位置、大致的强度以及它们的变化。夏季，大陆比海洋暖，被季风因素所决定的大气活动中心的分布，恰好同冬季相反，太平洋上出现非常发达的太平洋高气压，而在亚洲大陆上则是印度热低气压特别显著。春秋二季是海陆热力差异的转变季节。春季，从海洋比大陆暖的冬季情况转变为比大陆冷的季节，在这季节里也正是蒙古高气压衰退变为蒙古低气压、印度低气压和太平洋高气压逐渐取代阿留申低气压的转变过程。秋季则从海洋比大陆冷的夏季情况转变为比大陆暖的过渡时期，也正是蒙古高气压又迅速取代蒙古低气压和印度低气压，以及阿留申低气压发展到重占优势的变化过程。在同一季节，这些海陆间大气活动的中心位置、分布和强弱，以及不同季节里它们的季节变化情况，基本上也就是冬夏季风盛行和它的季节变化的过程。因此可以说，季风因素所形成的大气活动中心的分布，维持了季风现象，而季风现象的出现转而影响了半永久性的大气活动中心，进而影响大陆和海洋的天气，并且决定东亚的气候。
    目前虽然还不能很好地把这些同季风因素密切联系的大气活动中心的季节变化，直接同当天的或短时间的天气现象和它的变化联系起来，但是可以相信，这些活动中心的季节变化，决定了某一定地区各不同季节的天气特色，也就是说在短时期的天气里，一般也必然烙下季风的痕迹。例如东亚冬季各月，海陆热力差别特别大，季风的作用特别强，所以蒙古高气压和阿留申低气压特别发达。蒙古冷高气压和阿留申低气压间的气压梯度，使发自大陆的冷空气不断地南侵，这南侵冷高气压受季风因素的影响，又可以稳定在我国大陆上，因此，冷高气压形成了控制这时期的天气系统，这时期的天气特色是冷干。隆冬以后，太阳的辐射增强，大陆上加热比海洋快，海陆间热力的差异，先是日益变小，继则变为相反；因此，在冬季季风因素的作用日见减弱，而夏季的季风因素的作用日益加强下，大陆上蒙古高气压和太平洋上阿留申低气压强度日趋衰弱，而太平洋高气压和大陆低气压却日见发展。在这种季节变化的情况下，发自大陆的冬季风变弱，而发自海洋的夏季风却日有发展；在这冬夏季风相互冲击下，形成了春季晴雨寒暖无常的天气特色；春季以后，海洋变得比大陆冷，大陆低气压代替了冬季的蒙古高气压，太平洋高气压取代了阿留申低气压，中国大陆大部分地区在印度低气压和太平洋高气压控制下，形成热带和亚热带天气，它的特色是闷热多雷阵雨，一切气象要素的变化都小。盛夏以后，大陆迅速冷却，海洋又转而比大陆暖，季风因素使大陆的印度低气压和太平洋高气压日渐减弱，而蒙古高气压和阿留申低气压又日渐发展，从蒙古迅速南下，入侵中国大陆的冷高气压，逐渐成为这季节的主要的天气系统。因此我们说，在东亚要是忽略季风的作用，就无法比较全面地了解或说明东亚各不同季节的天气特色。
    同样，要不研究东亚季风的性质、结构以及活动情况，很难对东亚冬季干冷、夏季湿热多雨和春秋季晴雨多变的气候特征，有比较清楚的了解。但在知道了东亚冬夏季风的性质和它的相互消长情况以后，从不同季节季风的活动情况，很容易定性地说明这些气候现象。必须强调“定性”，因为一地区气候的形成因素很多，海陆间的季风是其中的一个因素，对东亚来说，季风因素可能是很主要的，但到底是不是最主要的，必须进行许多研究工作才能肯定，这也是强调研究季风问题的重要性的另一个理由。
    对东亚天气气候的形成来说，不应该也不能忽视这作为东亚天气气候基础之一（甚至可能是最主要的一个）的季风因素或季风现象的研究。即对一个月以上的长期预报和季节预报来说，也不能不重视季风这一因素，因为长期预报的主要根据之一，是大气活动中心季节变化的持续性，而大气活动中心的形成、季节消长和季风因素的季节变化有着直接的、非常密切的联系。
    更重要的，在气象学上讨论某些大气环流或气候现象时，常常出现强调热力作用和强调动力作用的争论。一般都承认太阳辐射的纬度差别所形成的南北向热力直接交换，对地表上热量的平衡、大气环流和气候的形成是很重要的。但是对海陆分布所形成的季风现象，并由它所产生的海陆方向的热力直接交换的作用，却有很不同的看法。虽然目前没有较多的和较深入的研究，因而无法肯定正确的估价，但是通过作为热力直接环流的季风问题的研究，一定可以使人们进一步认识热力作用在天气、气候以及大气环流上所产生的影响。
    海陆分布的季风因素的重要性，只是对季风现象的生成说的，具体的季风现象是受所在地区的大气环流和具体的地理条件的制约；因此同样的海陆间的季风因素，而表现在同纬度大陆的东西岸（西欧和东亚）的季风现象，显然不同。即同在大陆东海岸（例如北美东部和欧亚大陆的东岸），由于海陆的分布有大小和形状的不同，具体地形有差别，因而北美同东亚的季风现象就有明显与否、简单与复杂的不同。不仅这样，就是在同一大陆的东海岸，但所在地的大气环流情况不同，季风现象也不会是一样的；东南亚和中国同处在同一大陆的东岸，季风现象就不是完全一样的。这说明两个问题：第一，季风问题是非常复杂的，这种复杂性在季风问题的研究上必然增加许多困难，也就是说任何简单化的研究，一定不会很好地切合实际情况。第二，季风现象具有极其重要的地区色彩，因此，虽然在形成原因上，北美的、印度的、非洲的或东亚的季风都是一致的，而表现的季风现象很不同。
    因此，在研究东亚季风问题时，必须注意东亚季风现象在大气环流中的位置的特点。东亚冬季风是出现在西风环流影响下的，因此在蒙古冷高气压的南半部，季风因素所引起的西北季风或东北季风，在二公里以上的高空，就转变为西风和西南风，这是极相反的变化；因此，这地区上的季风和反季风必然是非常清楚而容易分别的。可是在冷高气压的北半部，地面和高空都盛行西风，因而很难把海陆分布所产生的季风部分和西风环流分开，这就增加了在这地区上研究冬季季风的困难。夏季季风分别出现在赤道西风带、副热带、东风带和西风带里，因此季风现象必然是错综复杂的。在夏季热赤道以南的华南和南中国海上，由于海陆分布所产生的西南季风，和因行星风系季节移动所产生的西南风是一致的，因此西南季风是相当深厚的，同时冬夏季风风向的变换几乎是相反的，因此可以相信这地区季风的季节变换必然非常明显。热赤道以北，副热带高压脊以南，我国东部和东南沿海地区，由于海岸近于南北走向，海陆分布所产生的南风同行星风带季节变动所引起的东风带重合，形成我国的东南季风，因此可以推论，这地区的东南季风也一定很深厚。在副热带高气压脊以北，或我国黄河流域以北国境地区，冬夏季都在西风带影响下，经常受非周期性气压系统的扰乱，因此冬夏季风不会是稳定的，它的变换也不会是明显的。
    由于东亚和东南亚所在的大气环流位置有异有同，因此季风现象也有差别或者类同。例如在华南的一部分地方和南中国海上，冬夏季风的性质、结构和季节变化，都应该同印度是相似的；在我国东海岸，海陆影响的季节变换比印度半岛东海岸明显；因此，我国的冬季东北季风和夏季东南季风的变换就比印度显著。夏季，东亚在赤道西风带、东风带和西风带影响下，而印度则在单一赤道西风带控制下，季风现象在许多方面都根本不同。因此用处理印度季风的方法来研究东亚季风现象一定不会得到好结果。
    在比较北美和亚欧大陆的季风现象时，常常认为欧亚大陆比北美大陆大了三到四倍，因此欧亚大陆的季风现象应该比北美明显三到四倍。我们认为比较合理地考虑海陆的大小，应当把赤道以北的非洲大陆也考虑在内，这样不仅亚欧非大陆的季风现象应当比北美明显四到五倍，而且更容易解释盛夏印度低气压中心不在北非，而在阿拉伯。因为这样大小的大陆，它的中心不是落在我国的新疆，而应当在阿拉伯沙漠上。
    不仅海陆的大小将影响到季风的明显性和稳定性等，就是同样大小的海陆而形状有差异，季风现象也将有差别。北美大陆主要是南北向排列（南北向长六十纬度，东西向宽三十五经度），形状北宽南窄，而欧亚非大陆为近东西向的排列，南北向近乎等宽（东西向宽近一百五十经度，而南北向宽近七十纬度）。正因为这差异，无论冬夏，在欧亚非大陆上，因海陆分布影响可以在同纬度上出现闭合等温线。而北美大陆则主要为西东走向，很少有闭合的等温线。这差异会引起北美和亚欧非大陆的季风现象有很大的不同。
    还由于亚欧非大陆的西东向海岸线比北美长三倍多，这也规定了东南亚地区东北季风转变为西南季风，必然比北美明显（北美根本没有西南季风）。同样的，北美的主要大陆分布在高纬度，而亚欧非大陆主要分布在低纬度，因而后者的季风现象受西风环流影响比前者小，这样也就更增加了欧亚非季风现象的显著性。
    还有大地形的特点。季风现象是在大气环流和具体下垫面（除海陆外，主要是地形）的错综影响下的综合现象。东亚地形的复杂、高原之大，世无其匹，拔海一千到二千公尺的高原面积占我国面积35％，二千公尺以上的占33％，三千公尺以上的占16％，姑不论既高又大的西藏高原屏障以西对季风所起的动力作用；可以设想，这样大的高原在热力作用方面的重要性，如果它对四周的自由大气来说，有冷热源作用，并且冷热源有季节变化，那就可以想像东亚季风并不单是海陆间温度差异和季节变化的结果，而高原和同高度自由大气间温度差异以及它的相对变化所形成的气流场，也必然会增加东亚季风的多样性和复杂性。不考虑大地形的特点，就可能对季风现象的某些特征无法解释。
    因此，再一次强调研究东亚季风的重要性，不仅仅因为它是气象学上具有根本意义的问题，而且是东亚天气气候的特色——北半球同纬度地区难于比拟的特色，祖国的气象工作者有责任去研究它。
