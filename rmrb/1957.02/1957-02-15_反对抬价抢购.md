    Against Price Gouging and Panic Buying

    Since the opening of the free market, some state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private commercial personnel in some provinces have been raising prices to搶購黑瓜子 and buying up large quantities (套購) of black melon seeds produced in Jiangxi Province, even engaging in illegal and undisciplined behavior. For example, Chen Ziping and Liu Guihai, purchasing agents from the dried and fresh fruit management department of the Wuhan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative, carried blank introduction letters stamped with their unit's official seal and went to Chashi Township and Niuwan Township in Qingjiang County last September to conduct covert, high-price抢購黑瓜子 activities. They did not go through the local administrative departments, nor did they contact relevant units. They hired four "second-hand dealers" (二販子) at a wage of 1.5 yuan per day and used petty favors to win over several members of agricultural cooperatives to help purchase black melon seeds. After receiving the melon seeds, they paid an additional handling fee of more than one yuan per 100 jin. What price did they pay? At that time, the local purchase price was 31 yuan per 100 jin, but they purchased at 39 yuan, exceeding the listed price by 25.8%, creating market chaos.

    Similarly, Wang Xichang, a purchasing agent from the Guilin City Trading Company in Guangxi Province, went to Youjia Agricultural Cooperative in Taiyang Township, Fengcheng County, in early December last year to抢購黑瓜子 at high prices. At that time, the cooperative had more than 17,000 jin of melon seeds, but the goods had already been shipped to the North Station in Nanchang City, ready for transport to Hankou for sale. At this time, he said to the cooperative cadres, "Sell me the melon seeds! I can offer a higher price." He immediately offered 70 yuan per 100 jin. The farmers saw that he was so generous, so they bargained, and the final price was 75 yuan, exceeding the local purchase price by 78.5%. They also prepaid a deposit of 460 yuan.

    There were also high-price抢購黑瓜子 activities from Hunan, Anhui, Hubei and other places. According to incomplete statistics, more than 700,000 jin were bought away at high prices. This not only affected Jiangxi Province's export and internal allocation tasks for black melon seeds, but also affected the completion of the state's procurement plan, affected the relationship between farmers and local governments and supply and marketing cooperatives, and stimulated local price increases.

    This unhealthy business style must be resolutely stopped.

    Since entering the peak season, some commercial departments in Shenyang, Dalian, Beijing, Nanchang, Wuhu, Shanghai and other places have used methods such as "raising prices to搶購黑瓜子," "long-term advance purchases," and "paying loans in advance" to compete for goods in the Zhejiang market. A purchasing agent from Shanghai went to Ningbo and bought up all the hot water bottle bamboo shells produced by Ningbo handicraft factories at 4.6 yuan per dozen, which was one yuan higher per dozen than the purchase price of the Ningbo Department Store. The Dalian Glass Factory also抢購黑瓜子 the white bamboo shells that Ningbo handicraft factories were preparing to produce for the department store. The Nanchang Department Store ordered 3,000 leather suitcases and 6,500 pairs of leather shoes from the Wenzhou Leather Factory by raising prices. Some purchasing personnel even purchased unqualified goods at the price of qualified products. A joint state-private store in Beijing bought 200 dozen unqualified iron locks from Wenzhou Hardware Cooperative No. 1 and even sent a letter praising "your products are good, and we hope to supply more in the future." The Nanchang Department Store ordered 60,000 knives and scissors from the Ningbo Knife and Scissors Production Cooperative and even stipulated in the contract that the goods would not be inspected upon receipt.

    Recently, it was also discovered that some unidentified out-of-town purchasing agents were套購 goods from Zhejiang Province's department store retail shops. In the Jinhua City market, there were people from Jiangsu and other places claiming to be buying old goods, who套購 90 dozen plastic hair combs from the local department store at retail prices and were preparing to搜羅 more in Wenzhou and other places. It is said that after buying these new hair combs, they broke them and used them as raw materials to be transported to Shanghai to be remade into plastic hair ties for exorbitant profits.

    This situation of抢購 in the market has fueled the phenomenon of some production units producing substandard and shoddy products, regardless of product quality. The Ningbo Leather Making Cooperative delivered 25 airline leather suitcases to the Ningbo Department Store in October last year, of which 16 suitcases had broken straps. The Ningbo Suitcase Production Cooperative and the Knife and Scissors Production Cooperative refused to replace the substandard products rejected by the receiving unit.

    Some production units, in order to obtain high profits, even refused to establish business relations with local state-owned companies. After accepting orders from certain units in Nanchang, the local state-owned Wenzhou Leather Factory demanded that the Wenzhou Department Store raise the purchase price, otherwise it would sell on its own. Wenzhou No. 2 Hardware Production Cooperative also unreasonably demanded that the Wenzhou Department Store raise the purchase price of iron locks. The cooperative director openly said to the members, "To improve our lives, we can only strive for self-sales." The production units in Wenzhou that produce suitcases, leather shoes, wooden corner combs, mirrors, bamboo baskets, etc., are unwilling to accept the commercial departments' procurement tasks for the first quarter of next year. Zhejiang's commercial departments are already facing great difficulties in organizing sources of goods.

    Some members of handicraft production cooperatives are not focused on production and want to produce and sell on their own. Some members of the Ningbo Knife and Scissors Production Cooperative, Suitcase Production Cooperative, and Leather Making Production Cooperative have already withdrawn from the cooperative. What will happen if this continues?

### 反对抬价抢购

    反对抬价抢购
    开放自由市场以来，有些省的国营、合作社、公私合营商业人员，对江西省出产的黑瓜子抬价抢购、套购，甚至出现了违法乱纪的非法行为。如武汉市供销社干鲜果经理部采购员陈子平、刘桂海，随身带着本单位盖好公章的空白介绍信，于去年9月前往清江县槎市乡和牛湾乡一带，进行暗地高价抢购黑瓜子的活动，他们既不通过当地行政部门，又不同有关单位联系。他们以每天一元五角工资雇用了四个二贩子，又用小恩小惠手段拢络了几个农业社社员，帮助收购黑瓜子。收到了瓜子，另按每百斤给一元多的手续费。以什么价格收购呢？当时当地收购牌价每百斤为三十一元，而他们竟以三十九元收购，超出牌价25.8％，造成市场的混乱现象。
    另如广西省桂林市贸易公司采购员王锡昌，在去年12月上旬，到丰城县太阳乡游家农业社高价抢购瓜子。当时该社有瓜子一万七千多斤，但货已起运到南昌市北站，准备运往汉口出售。这时他便对该社干部说：“瓜子卖给我吧！可以多出价钱。”开口就出七十元一百斤。农民看到他这样慷慨，便来个讨价还价，结果以七十五元成交了，并预付四百六十元定金，超过当地收购牌价78.5％。
    还有湖南、安徽、湖北等地来此地高价抢购黑瓜子的活动。据不完全统计，各地高价买走的竟达七十余万斤。这不仅影响了江西省对黑瓜子的出口和内外调剂任务的完成，还影响了国家收购计划的完成，影响了农民同当地政府和供销社的关系，刺激了当地的物价上涨。
    这种不良的经营作风，必须坚决制止。　　　巩继山　徐和耕
    自进入旺季以来，沈阳、旅大、北京、南昌、芜湖、上海等地有些商业部门，用“抬价抢购”、“长期预购”、“先付贷款”等方法到浙江市场上争货。上海一个采购员到了宁波，就把宁波手工厂生产的热水瓶花竹壳搜罗光了，每打四元六角，比宁波百货站的收购价每打高一元。旅大玻璃厂，也把宁波手工厂准备给百货站生产的白竹壳，也抢购去了。南昌市百货公司以抬高价格的手段，向温州皮革厂订购了皮箱三千只，皮鞋六千五百双。有些采购人员，连不合规格的商品也按正品价格收购去。北京公私合营商店，向温州五金一社买去不合规格的铁锁二百打，还去信表扬“你们产品好，希望今后多供应”。南昌百货站向宁波刀剪生产社订购了六万把刀剪，竟在合同上订明收货时不验货。
    最近还发现一些身分不明的外来采购员，向浙江省百货零售商店套购商品。金华市市场上，有来自江苏等地自称收旧货的人员，他们以零售价向该地百货业套购塑胶发梳九十打，还准备到温州等地搜罗。据说，他们买去这些新发梳后，便把它打破作为原料，贩运到上海改制塑胶发绳，以牟取暴利。
    市场上这种抢购的情况，助长了某些生产单位粗制滥造、不顾产品质量的现象。宁波制革社，去年10月向宁波百货站交航空皮箱二十五只，其中有十六只皮箱的皮带已断。宁波市衣箱生产社、刀剪生产社，不肯掉换被收货单位剔出来的次品。
    部分生产单位，为了获取高利，竟拒绝和当地国营公司发生业务关系。地方国营温州制革厂，接受了南昌某些单位的定货后，便要求温州百货站提高收购价格，否则便要自销。温州第二五金生产社，也曾无理要求温州百货站提高铁锁的收购价。该社主任公开向社员说：“要改善生活，只有争取自销”。温州的皮箱、皮鞋、木角梳、镜子、篾箕等生产单位，都不愿接受商业部门明年第一季度的收购任务。浙江的商业部门在组织货源上已遇到很大的困难。
    部分手工业生产社社员，不安心生产，要自产自销。宁波市刀剪生产社、衣箱生产社、制革生产社、已有部分社员退了社。这样下去，怎么得了？　　赵公杰　王彭年
