Actively Promote the 岱 (Dai) Character Cotton Improved Variety
    Jin Xibin

    The Dai Character Cotton No. 15 is a relatively outstanding improved variety. In 1950, the total cotton fields planted with Dai Character Cotton in the country were only 330,000 mu, but by 1956 it had expanded to 28.41 million mu, an increase of 85 times in seven years. This has played a significant role in increasing cotton production and quality, and at the same time increased the income of cotton farmers.

    According to existing data, Dai Character Cotton has great adaptability. In Shijiazhuang, Handan, Xiao County, Luoyang, Yuncheng, Suining, Jianyang and other places, the growth of the planted Dai Character Cotton is good. In Wuqiao, Zhengzhou, Shangqiu and other places, the yield of Dai Character Cotton ranks first.

    In 1956, the planting area of improved cotton varieties in the country accounted for 89% of the total cotton field area. This year, the country plans to continue to promote improved cotton varieties by more than 16 million mu (including the second variety replacement area), of which Dai Character Cotton accounts for about 70%. If this year's task of promoting improved cotton varieties is completed, the area of improved varieties will reach 96% of the total cotton field area, which can basically meet the requirements put forward in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967.

    Completing the promotion plan of Dai Character Cotton is the key to completing this year's promotion plan of improved cotton varieties. Last year, the yield increase in the new promotion areas of Dai Character Cotton in Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Sichuan and other places was very significant, and it was generally welcomed by the masses. Therefore, in areas suitable for planting Dai Character Cotton, there are favorable conditions for actively expanding the improved variety of Dai Character Cotton No. 15.

    Generally speaking, the situation of promoting the improved variety of Dai Character Cotton this year is that the quantity is sufficient and the quality is good. However, the promotion plans of Dai Character Cotton in some areas have not been finalized, and some areas are not adequately prepared for improved varieties. Now there is only one month left before cotton sowing. If the promotion plan is not finalized quickly or the improved varieties cannot be mastered according to the plan, this year's plan for promoting improved varieties will not be completed. In areas where there is not enough quantity of improved Dai Character Cotton, agricultural departments should further cooperate with cotton purchasing and oil departments to find ways to obtain more improved varieties, and actively gin and preserve the seeds. At the same time, they can also try to exchange the excellent Dai Character Cotton seeds that farmers have reserved for edible oil raw materials from agricultural cooperatives in these areas. In the peripheral areas where trial planting, demonstration or cultivation of Dai Character Cotton seeds have matured, agricultural cooperatives that plan to change to Dai Character Cotton this year can also be organized to exchange with agricultural cooperatives that have surplus Dai Character Cotton seeds. In short, in areas where the improved variety of Dai Character Cotton No. 15 has been determined to be suitable for cultivation and growth, time should be seized to actively promote the improved variety of Dai Character Cotton in various ways.

    积极推广岱字棉良种
    金熙彬
    岱字棉15号是一个比较突出的优良品种。1950年全国种岱字棉的棉田总计不过三十三万亩，1956年已扩展到二千八百四十一万亩，七年间增加了八十五倍。这对提高棉花产量和质量起了显著作用，同时增加了棉农的收益。
    根据现有资料来看，岱字棉的适应性很大。在石家庄、邯郸、萧县、洛阳、运城、遂宁、简阳等地，种植的岱字棉的生长情况良好，在吴桥、郑州、商丘等地，岱字棉的产量都居第一位。
    1956年，全国棉花良种的种植面积已占总棉田面积的89％，今年全国计划继续推广棉花良种一千六百多万亩（包括第二次换种面积），其中岱字棉约占70％。如果完成今年棉花良种推广任务以后，良种面积将达棉田总面积的96％，基本上可以实现1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）中提出的要求。
    完成岱字棉的推广计划，是完成今年推广棉花良种计划的关键。去年在山东、河南、湖北、四川等地新推广岱字棉地区的增产都很显著，普遍受到了群众欢迎。所以在适宜种植岱字棉的地区，积极扩大岱字棉15号良种是有有利条件的。
    今年推广岱字棉良种的情况，一般说是数量充足、质量也好。但是个别地区推广岱字棉的计划仍未最后确定下来，有的地区良种准备不足。现在距棉花播种只有一个来月的时间，如果不赶快确定推广计划或不能按计划完成掌握良种，就会使今年推广良种的计划不能完成。在没有掌握足够岱字棉良种数量的地区，农业部门应该进一步结合棉花采购和油脂部门，设法获得更多的良种，积极轧花保种；同时还可尽量从这些地区的农业社中，换出农民自己留作食油原料的优良岱字棉种。在试种、示范成熟或已栽培岱字棉种的边沿地区，也可组织今年计划改种岱字棉的农业社，向存有多余岱字棉种的农业社进行互换。总之，在已经确定岱字棉15号良种适宜栽培生长的地区，应该抓紧时间，采用各种方式，积极推广岱字棉良种。
