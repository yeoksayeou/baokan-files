    Let Waste Become Good Raw Materials for Industrial Production
    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Acquire Large Quantities of Discarded Materials

    (Our Dispatch) In 1956, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country expanded their procurement of waste and discarded materials. Over the past year, they acquired a total of 1,267,200 tons of various types of waste products. Among these, the total volume of scrap copper, scrap steel, tin, lead, waste rubber, animal bones, rags, and waste cotton amounted to more than 810,000 tons, an increase of 58.5% compared to 1955, supporting national economic construction and increasing the income of the masses.

    The various types of waste and discarded materials collected by the supply and marketing cooperatives in a scattered and decentralized manner were processed and sorted, effectively supporting the production of national metallurgy, rubber, papermaking, chemical and other industries, local industries, and handicrafts, and reducing the production costs of industrial products. For example, in the past three years, the supply and marketing cooperatives have acquired more than 1.12 million tons of scrap steel, supplying the needs of steelmaking, machinery manufacturing, and handicrafts, and during processing, they selected many high-quality steel and machine parts, preventing them from being destroyed by remelting. In addition to being used for extracting oil and manufacturing bone glue and bone char for industrial use and export, animal bones are also used to produce large quantities of bone meal fertilizer. Using waste materials such as rags, waste cotton, waste hemp, broken fishing nets, and worn-out cloth shoes to make paper saved 660,000 cubic meters of wood.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have also supported the production and self-salvation of people in disaster areas with a large number of waste items and raw materials; the supply of cotton clothing, cotton shoes, bedding, rags, and used rubber tires to the disaster-stricken people of Tianjin Prefecture alone amounted to more than 130 tons.

    In their work of procuring waste products, the supply and marketing cooperatives have focused on the characteristic that wherever there is people's production and life, there is waste. They have tried every means to tap potential and go deep into urban and rural areas to carry out acquisitions. The varieties of goods acquired and managed by supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have increased from 120 in the past to more than 500 at present. In some provinces and cities, such as Liaoning, Shanghai, and Beijing, the varieties managed have reached more than 10,000. Many varieties that could not be recycled and utilized in the past, such as fish scales, used batteries, cattail mats, waste plastic, and industrial and mining waste slag, can now be recycled and utilized in large quantities after research with production units.

    Mechanical manufacturing enterprises have long discarded large quantities of steel shavings and filings, amounting to approximately 300,000 tons per year, some of which are piled up like mountains or severely oxidized and corroded. After the supply and marketing cooperatives recover these waste products, they can be processed into iron cakes and recycled iron, and then supplied to the metallurgy and machinery manufacturing industries. From January to September 1956, the Tianjin Waste Products Management Office alone acquired more than 6,300 tons of scrap steel shavings from various enterprises. (Zhang Runsheng)

    让废品成为工业生产的好原料
    供销合作社收购了大批废弃物资
    本报讯　1956年，全国各地供销合作社扩大了废旧物资的采购业务。一年来收购各种废品一百二十六万七千二百吨。其中杂铜、废钢铁、锡、铅、废橡胶、兽骨、破布、废棉的总量为八十一万多吨，比1955年增加58.5％，支援了国家经济建设，增加了群众收入。
    供销社零星分散地收集起来的各种废旧物资，经过加工整理，有效地支援了国家冶金、橡胶、造纸、化学等工业、地方工业和手工业的生产，并减低了工业产品的生产成本。例如，过去三年供销社收购的废钢铁达一百十二万多吨，供应了炼钢、机器制造和手工业的需要，并在加工中拣选出许多优质钢、机器部件，防止了回炉毁坏。兽骨除可熬油和制造工业用与出口的骨胶、骨炭以外，还生产了大批骨粉肥料。用破布、废棉、废麻、破鱼网、破布鞋等废料造纸，节省了木材六十六万立方公尺。
    各地供销社还以大量的废旧物品、废品原料支援了灾区人民的生产自救，仅供应天津专区灾民的棉衣、棉鞋、被褥、破布、废旧橡胶轮胎等即达一百三十多吨。
    供销合作社在采购废品工作中，针对哪里有人们生产和生活，哪里就有废品的特点，从多方面想办法，挖潜力，深入城乡收购。各地供销社收购、经营的品种从过去的一百二十种增加到目前的五百多种。有的省市如辽宁、上海、北京经营品种达到一万多种。过去不能回收利用的许多品种如鱼鳞、废电池、蒲包、废塑胶、工厂企业的垃圾堆渣等，经过同生产单位研究，也能够大量回收利用了。
    机械制造企业长年废置着大量钢铁的切屑、刨花等，每年约有三十万吨，有的堆积成山或受到严重氧化腐蚀。供销社把这些废品回收后，可以加工成铁饼、再生铁，再供应冶金和机器制造业。天津废品经营处1956年1至9月即收购各企业六千三百多吨废钢铁屑。（张润生）
