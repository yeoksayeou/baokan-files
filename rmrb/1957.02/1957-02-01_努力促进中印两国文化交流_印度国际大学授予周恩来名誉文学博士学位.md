Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, January 31st: Premier Zhou Enlai received an honorary Doctorate of Literature from Visva-Bharati University, founded by Tagore, in Santiniketan near Calcutta on the morning of January 30th.

Professor Bose, the Vice-Chancellor of Visva-Bharati, delivered a speech at the degree-awarding ceremony. He draped the highest degree stole over Zhou Enlai's shoulders and presented him with the degree certificate. More than a thousand people attended the ceremony.

In his speech, Professor Bose said: "We believe that you have been serving the same great ideals that once inspired our prophet and founder, Tagore; at Visva-Bharati University, we want to organize the study of the cultural contributions of all countries to realize this great ideal."

He mentioned Premier Zhou Enlai's efforts to maintain peace and his work for a "great future." He said, "At that time, all countries will unite like a family, everyone will live in peace, and each country will plan its own destiny in harmony with other countries."

In his speech of thanks, Premier Zhou Enlai said that he felt unworthy of receiving the honor bestowed upon him. He said that he would regard this as an expression of the friendship of the Indian people and their appreciation of the achievements of the Chinese people in their cause of liberation and national construction.

He praised the founder of the university, saying that he was "a talented poet who made outstanding contributions to world literature," and also "an outstanding representative of the great Indian people who hated darkness and strived for light." He said that the Chinese people would not forget Tagore's support for their struggle for national independence.

Zhou Enlai praised the university for both promoting excellent Indian national culture and appropriately emphasizing modern science and technology and the study of the culture of other countries – especially China. He expressed that he would place more emphasis on the study of Indian culture in Chinese universities and would do everything possible to develop cultural exchanges with India.

Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that the unity and cooperation between China and India, which have the largest populations in the world, would play an increasingly important role in maintaining peace in Asia and the world. He said: "I believe that our two countries will continue to strengthen our friendship and further develop cooperation in all fields so that we can jointly fulfill our due responsibilities."

After the ceremony, Zhou Enlai, He Long, and their entourage observed two minutes of silence with the university faculty and students to commemorate the ninth anniversary of Gandhi's assassination.

Premier Zhou Enlai received Professor Tan Yunshan, who has lived in India for twenty-nine years and is now the Dean of the Cheena-Bhavana (Chinese Department) at Visva-Bharati.

Zhou Enlai and He Long spent nearly an hour in the room where Tagore lived and worked during his lifetime. They saw photos of Tagore's visit to China in 1924. They also received gifts of Tagore's works. Among the poet's many items collected was a letter written by Sun Yat-sen to the poet in 1924, inviting him to Guangzhou. Sun Yat-sen not only called Tagore a great writer and scholar, but also called him "the most valuable worker in the department of undertakings that nurtures the seeds of human future happiness and spiritual fruits."

The guests then visited the university library and some departments.

Before leaving, Zhou Enlai donated 60,000 rupees to the Tagore Memorial Fund. He told the Vice-Chancellor that he would send some Chinese books to the Cheena-Bhavana. He also agreed to a suggestion from the Vice-Chancellor of the University: students from the Cheena-Bhavana could be sent to China to study after their third year.

The guests returned to Calcutta at around 7:00 p.m. that evening.

    努力促进中印两国文化交流
    印度国际大学授予周恩来名誉文学博士学位
    据新华社加尔各答31日电　周恩来总理1月30日上午在加尔各答附近的和平村（山提尼克坦）接受了泰戈尔创办的印度国际大学所授予的名誉文学博士学位。
    国际大学副校长鲍斯教授在授予学位的集会上发表了演说。他把最高学位披巾披在周恩来肩上，并且把学位证书递交给他。出席集会的有一千多人。
    鲍斯教授在演说中说：“我们认为您一直在为那种曾经鼓舞过我们的先知和创始人泰戈尔的相同的伟大理想而服务；我们在国际大学就是想组织对所有国家的文化贡献的研究来实现这种伟大的理想。”
    他提到了周恩来总理为维护和平而作的努力和为“伟大的将来”而进行的工作。他说，“到那时，各国将团结得像一家人，大家都将和平共处，而每一个国家将在与其他国家融洽的情况下规划出自己的命运。”
    周恩来总理致词表示感谢，他说，他对领受给予他的荣誉感到不敢当。他说，他将把这件事看作是印度人民的友谊和对中国人民在解放和国家建设事业中所取得的成就的赞赏的一种表示。
    他赞扬了这所学府的创办人，说他是“一位对世界文学作出了卓越贡献的天才诗人”，也是“一位厌恶黑暗、争取光明的伟大印度人民的杰出代表”。他说，中国人民将不会忘记泰戈尔对他们争取民族独立的斗争的支持。
    周恩来赞扬这所大学既能发扬优秀的印度民族文化，同时又能适当重视现代科学技术和对其他国家——尤其是对中国——的文化的研究工作。他表示将在中国大学中更多地强调研究印度文化，并且要尽一切力量发展同印度的文化交流。
    周恩来总理指出，拥有世界上最多人口的中印两国的团结与合作，对于维持亚洲以及世界的和平将发挥越来越大的作用。他说：“我相信我们两国将继续加强我们的友谊和进一步发展各方面的合作，以便我们能够共同履行我们应尽的责任。”
    在仪式结束后，周恩来、贺龙和随行人员同大学师生一同静默两分钟，悼念甘地被刺九周年。
    周恩来总理接见了住在印度已有二十九年、现在担任国际大学中国学院院长的谭云山教授。
    周恩来和贺龙在泰戈尔生前工作和生活的房间内逗留了将近一小时。他们看到了泰戈尔在1924年访问中国时的照片。他们还接受了赠送给他们的泰戈尔的著作。在收藏的诗人的许多物品中有孙中山在1924年写给诗人的一封邀请他到广州去的信。孙中山不但称泰戈尔为伟大的作家和学者，而且称他为“在孕育着人类未来的幸福和精神果实的种子的事业部门中的最可贵的工作者”。
    客人们接着参观了大学的图书馆和一些学系。
    在离开前，周恩来捐赠了六万卢比给泰戈尔纪念基金。他对副校长说，他将送一些中文图书给中国学院。他还同意了大学副校长的一个建议：中国学院的学生在三年级以后可以送到中国去留学。
    客人在当天晚上七时左右回到加尔各答。
