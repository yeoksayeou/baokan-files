　　Modifying Stoves and Improving Firing Methods
　　Firemen and Cooks Conserve Coal

　　This newspaper reports that since the Ministry of Communications office building began using coal for heating on November 7 of last year, it has saved more than 210,000 jin of coal for heating in fifty-four firing days. The average daily coal consumption per square foot of the furnace bed has been reduced by 31.37% compared to the prescribed standard. The reasons for these achievements are, on the one hand, that the leaders of the competent departments attach importance to this and often educate the workers on saving coal; on the other hand, the firemen have researched and improved the firing methods.

　　In terms of operating methods, they adopted intermittent fire-picking and fire-pressing methods and used the method of switching steam valves to regulate the air supply in separate paths, implementing cyclical steam delivery. Other measures were also taken to save coal, such as burning lump coal and pulverized coal separately; shortening the coal burning area while maintaining the normal indoor temperature; setting air-blocking pads on radiators with high indoor temperatures to regulate the temperature; stopping the air supply to corridors and unused conference rooms and offices; plastering the fire channels at the rear of the furnace with mud to prevent the chimney from drawing away residual fire; strictly controlling the firing time according to changes in the weather, and so on. The workers also paid attention to fully utilizing the burned coal slag.

　　On January 14, at a meeting held by the State Council Administration of Government Offices and the Beijing Coal Construction Company to exchange experiences in saving coal, the experience of the Ministry of Communications in saving coal for heating was also introduced. Afterwards, twelve units, including the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, successively sent representatives to the Ministry of Communications to visit and learn.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xining, January 27th: The boiler workers of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China used to put up to 800 jin of lump coal into the boiler every day, but now they only burn 500 jin of coal slag every day. The boiler workers of more than 30 boilers in the city saved more than 1,700 tons of lump coal and slag in November and December of last year. Up to now, more than 90 units in Xining City, including the Qinghai Provincial Department of Transportation and the joint state-private brick and tile factory, have modified their stoves. The firemen and cooks of these units respectively mix 40% to 60% of coal slag when burning, changing the past habit of burning all lump coal and slag.

　　In the process of modifying the stoves, these units increased the furnace bars on the stoves and changed the in-line cooking stove to a mixed stove. The Qinghai Provincial Company of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company sent cadres to Lanzhou and other places several times last year to visit and learn about the experience of modifying stoves. It also held a forum for managers and firing technicians of units using heating boilers to study and improve coal burning methods.

    改炉改灶改进烧火方法
    烧火工人和炊事员节约煤炭
    本报讯　交通部办公大楼从去年11月7日开始烧火取暖起，在五十四个烧火日中已经节约了二十一万多斤取暖用煤。平均每天每平方尺的炉床耗煤量比规定标准降低了31.37％。取得这些成绩的原因一方面是因为主管部门领导重视，经常向工人进行节约煤的教育；一方面是由于生火工人研究改进了烧火方法。
    在操作方法上，他们采用间断挑火压火法和倒换汽门分路调节送气办法，实行循环送汽，在节约用煤方面还采取了其他措施，如烧煤时块、末分开烧；在保持室内正常温度前提下缩短烧煤面积；在室温高的暖气片上设阻气垫，调节温度；走廊和不用的会议室，办公室停止送气；把炉膛后部的火道缝用泥抹上，避免烟囱将余火抽走；根据天气变化，严格控制烧火时间等等。工人们也注意充分利用烧过的煤渣子。
    1月14日在国务院机关事务管理局和北京市煤建公司召开的交流节约用煤经验会议上，还介绍交通部节约取暖用煤的经验。以后，煤炭工业部、第二机械工业部和全国工商业联合会等十二个单位都先后派代表到交通部参观、学习。

    新华社西宁27日电　中共青海省委的烧锅炉工人过去每日投到锅炉中的块炭达八百市斤，现在每日只烧煤渣五百市斤。全市三十多个锅炉的烧锅炉工人在去年11、12两个月内就节省了块、渣炭一千七百多吨。到现在，西宁市已有青海省交通厅、公私合营砖瓦厂等九十多个单位改了炉灶，这些单位的烧火工人和炊事员在烧火时分别搭配40％到60％的煤渣，改变过去全部烧块、渣炭的习惯。
    在改炉灶过程中，这些单位在炉灶上加密了炉条，把一字形的吃饭灶改为混合灶。中国煤业建筑器材公司青海省公司去年好几次派出干部前往兰州等地参观、学习改炉改灶经验。并召开了使用暖气锅炉单位的管理人员和烧火技术人员座谈会，研究改进烧煤方法。
