Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 4th: Farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province are supporting national industrial construction with large quantities of livestock products. The initial plan for this year is to sell livestock products to the state worth more than 18 million yuan, an increase of more than 18% compared to last year.

In the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan, the total value of various livestock products sold to the state by farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province reached more than 70 million yuan. Among them, wool alone amounted to more than 57 million catties. If all this wool were exported, it could be exchanged for more than 250,000 tons of steel or a complete set of machinery and equipment for six textile factories with 50,000 spindles each. Qinghai Province has more than 15.9 million head of livestock, large and small, and livestock products are an abundant construction resource here. At present, the state purchases of livestock products alone number fifty or sixty varieties. Such as "Xining Wool," goat cashmere, sheep casings, and the pelts of wild animals such as marmots, lynx, and snowshoe hares, are all popular in domestic and foreign markets.

In recent years, the state has stipulated reasonable purchase prices for livestock products and has also established many purchasing stations in producing areas. After the cooperativization of agricultural areas, many farmers and purchasing departments have signed contracts or agreements for the sale of livestock products. Last year, in seven counties in agricultural areas, more than 70% of agricultural cooperatives established such connections with purchasing departments.

    青海农牧民大量出售畜产品
    据新华社西宁4日电　青海省各族农牧民以大量的畜产品支援国家工业建设。今年初步计划卖给国家的各种畜产品，价值一千八百多万元，比去年增长18％以上。
    在第一个五年计划的头四年中，青海省各族农牧民卖给国家的各种畜产品的总值达到了七千多万元。其中仅羊毛就有五千七百多万斤。如果这些羊毛全部出口，就可以换回二十五万多吨钢材或者是六个拥有五万纱锭的纺织厂的全套机器设备。青海省现有大小牲畜一千五百九十多万头，畜产品在这里是一项丰富的建设资源。目前仅国家收购的畜产品就有五、六十种。如“西宁羊毛”、山羊绒、羊肠衣以及旱獭、猞猁、扫雪等野兽皮张，在国内外市场上都受欢迎。
    近年来，国家规定了合理的畜产品收购价格，还在产区设立了许多收购站。农业区合作化以后，不少农民和采购部门订立了出售畜产品的合同或协议。去年，在农业区的七个县中就有70％以上的农业社与采购部门建立了这种联系。
