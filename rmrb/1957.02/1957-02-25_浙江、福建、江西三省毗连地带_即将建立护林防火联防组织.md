    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. Representatives from the forestry departments of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces held a joint forest fire prevention meeting in Hangzhou City from February 7th to 10th, deciding to establish a joint forest fire prevention organization in thirty-eight counties in the border area of the three provinces to strengthen forest fire prevention work.
    The meeting requested that joint prevention meetings at the township level be held in March, and that joint forest protection covenants be established by cooperatives, unifying fire prevention signals, maintaining close contact, preventing fires, pests and diseases, and illegal logging of trees, strengthening the unity of the masses in the border areas, and jointly doing a good job in forest fire prevention.
    The border area of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces is the area where the Yandang, Wuyi, and Xianxia mountain ranges meander, and it is rich in various timber, mainly Chinese fir, and is one of the important bases of timber in our country. However, due to the vast area and sparse population, forest fires and mass mountain forest disputes often occurred in the past. After a fire broke out, due to the lack of organized mutual support and fire fighting, it was often allowed to burn itself out, causing damage to state property. For example, in April 1955, in the border area between Shaowu County in Fujian and Lichuan County in Jiangxi, a large fire burned about 300 square *li* of woodland. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-two counties in the three provinces, seventeen major and minor mountain forest disputes have occurred in the past two years. Because they were not resolved in a timely manner, they affected the unity of the masses. In the past, the phenomenon of stealing and cutting down timber was also very serious.

    浙江、福建、江西三省毗连地带
    即将建立护林防火联防组织
    新华社杭州电　浙江、福建、江西三省的林业部门代表，2月7日到10日在杭州市举行护林防火联防会议，决定在三省毗连地带的三十八个县内，成立护林联防组织，加强护林防火工作。
    会议要求在3月份内开好乡一级的联防会议，以合作社为单位订立护林联防公约，统一防火信号，密切联系，制止火灾、病虫害和滥伐偷盗林木的现象，加强边界地区群众的团结，共同做好护林防火工作。
    浙江、福建、江西三省交界地区是雁荡、武夷、仙霞岭等山脉盘桓地带，盛产以杉木为主的各种林材，是我国林木的重要基地之一。但由于地广人稀，过去经常发生森林火灾和群众山林纠纷。火灾发生后又因为缺少有组织的互相支援、扑火，时常任其自烧自灭，使国家资财受到损失。如1955年4月间福建邵武县和江西黎川县交界地带，一次大火就烧去面积约三百平方华里的林木。据三个省二十二个县的不完全统计，两年来发生的大小山林纠纷十七次，因为得不到及时的解决，影响了群众团结。过去偷砍盗伐木材的现象也很严重。
