Achievements in Astronomical Scientific Research in China
First Member Representative Assembly of the Astronomical Society Held in Nanjing

    (Reported by this newspaper) The first Member Representative Assembly of the Chinese Astronomical Society and the inaugural meeting of the Academic Committee of the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were held in Nanjing from February 6th to 11th.

    Since liberation, China's astronomical science has greatly developed and achieved many accomplishments. The time service work, which is directly related to economic construction and national defense construction, has made considerable progress in instrument installation and constant determination over the past few years. The Purple Mountain Observatory has carried out time reception, time measurement, timekeeping, and trial determination of the time signal correction number for the Xujiahui Observatory, laying the foundation for the development of national time service work. The time signal transmission work of the Xujiahui Observatory has been increased from twice a day to five times a day based on previous operations; and efforts have been made to improve and trial-produce instruments, thereby improving the accuracy of time signal transmission. The latitude determination work has also prepared the technical conditions for the future establishment of latitude stations. Since 1951, the almanac compilation work has produced an astronomical almanac every year to meet the needs of astronomy and surveying departments. In the past three or four years, an aviation almanac and a nautical almanac have been added. In terms of positional astronomy work, one or two hundred positions of asteroids and comets obtained by photographic observations are published every year. In this work, four new asteroids have been discovered, and photographic studies of five galactic star clusters have been completed. Sky survey photography work is mainly carried out at the Kunming Phoenix Mountain Astronomical Work Station. Under conditions of extreme manpower shortage, nearly two hundred high-quality star image plates have been obtained. These plates have played a significant role in the study of long-period variable stars. Solar sunspot observation is a regular task jointly observed and uniformly published by the Purple Mountain, Sheshan, and Kunming observatories. Many experiments have also been carried out on solar physics and stellar physics. Some results have recently been obtained in photographic photometry of Cepheid variables and globular cluster variables. In the work of grinding astronomical telescopes, nearly ten qualified reflecting mirrors have been completed under extremely difficult working conditions, with the larger ones reaching forty centimeters in diameter; two sets of Schmidt telescope corrector lenses and spherical mirrors have also been ground. Most of these works have been written into papers or reports. From 1953 to the present, astronomers have published 123 papers and articles in the Acta Astronomica Sinica alone.

    At the meeting, Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Purple Mountain Observatory, made a report on "The Work Situation and Development Direction of the Purple Mountain Observatory," and Professor Dai Wensai made a report on the draft of the Twelve-Year Long-Term Plan for Astronomy. At the meeting, academic papers on astronomical science were also read and discussed, the current situation and long-term planning of astronomical work were discussed, the Board of Directors of the Astronomical Society was elected, and the Academic Committee of the Purple Mountain Observatory was established. Zhou Zanheng, Director of the Nanjing Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, announced on behalf of the Academy that Zhang Yuzhe and other thirteen people were members of the Academic Committee.

    我国天文科学研究取得成就
    天文学会首届会员代表大会在南京举行
    本报讯　中国天文学会第一届会员代表大会和中国科学院紫金山天文台学术委员会成立大会，于2月6日至11日在南京举行。
    解放以来，我国天文科学有了很大的发展，并取得不少成就。同经济建设和国防建设有直接关系的时辰工作，几年来在仪器安装、常数测定等方面作出了不少成绩。紫金山天文台进行了收时、测时、守时和试定徐家汇观象台时号改正数等工作，给全国时政工作的开展打下基础。徐家汇观象台的授时工作，在以往每天发播两次时号的基础上，增加到每天五次；并努力改进和试制仪器，提高了授时精确度。纬度测定工作，也为将来建立纬度站准备了技术上的条件。编历工作，自1951年起，每年编印一本天文年历，以适应天文和测量部门的需要。最近三、四年，又加编了航空历和航海历各一种。在方位天文工作方面，每年发表一、二百个用照相观测所得到的小行星和彗星的位置。在这项工作中，曾发现四个新的小行星，并完成了五个银河星团的照相研究。巡天摄影工作，主要在昆明凤凰山天文工作站进行。在人力极度缺乏的情况下，曾经得到近二百张质量优良的星象底片。这些底片，在长周期变星的研究工作中，已经起了不少作用。太阳的黑子观测，是紫金山、佘山、昆明三个台站联合观测统一发布的一项经常工作。对太阳物理和恒星物理也作了许多试验。关于造父变星和球状星团变星的照相测光，最近也得到一些成果。天文远镜磨制工作，在工作条件异常困难的情况下，完成了近十个合乎规格的反光镜面，直径大的达到四十厘米；还磨制了两套史密特型远镜的改正透镜和球面镜。所有这些工作，大多写成论文或报告。从1953年到现在，天文学工作者仅发表在天文学报上的论著就有一百二十三篇。
    会上，紫金山天文台台长张钰哲，作了“紫金山天文台的工作情况和发展方向”的报告，戴文赛教授作了天文学十二年远景规划草案报告。会上，还宣读和讨论了有关天文科学的学术论文，讨论了天文工作的现状和远景规划，选出了天文学会理事会，成立了紫金山天文台学术委员会，中国科学院南京办事处主任周赞衡代表科学院宣布了张钰哲等十三人为学术委员。
