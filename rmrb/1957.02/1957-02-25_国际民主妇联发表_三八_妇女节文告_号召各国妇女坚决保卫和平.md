Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 24th - The International Democratic Women's Federation issued a "March 8th" International Women's Day message on the 24th.

The message pointed out that since the establishment of International Women's Day in 1910, the women's movement has made many achievements, and women have contributed to all aspects of social life. In recent times, millions more women have participated in their peoples' struggles for national independence, progress, and peace, which is particularly encouraging.

The message said that on International Women's Day in 1957, women and mothers will express their firm determination to defend peace. Because women have made such great contributions to the realization of the Geneva and Bandung spirit, they will increase their vigilance to spare their children from the horrors of war and thwart those who pursue a policy of force. On March 8, 1957, women will raise their voices in favor of abiding by negotiations, opposing military blocs, and advocating friendship among nations.

The International Democratic Women's Federation reaffirms its friendly cooperation with various women's organizations. It firmly believes that closer relations will be more effective than ever before in consolidating the achievements already made, in moving more rapidly towards common goals, and in striving for the happiness of children, equal rights, human dignity, and peace.

    国际民主妇联发表“三八”妇女节文告
    号召各国妇女坚决保卫和平
    新华社柏林24日电　国际民主妇女联合会24日发表了“三八”国际妇女节文告。
    文告指出，自从1910年规定国际妇女节以来，妇女运动已经获得许多成就，妇女在社会生活各个方面都作出了贡献。在最近时期中，又有数以百万计的妇女参加了她们本国人民争取民族独立、进步和和平的斗争，这是特别令人鼓舞的。
    文告说，在1957年的国际妇女节，妇女和母亲将表示她们保卫和平的坚定决心。由于妇女对实现日内瓦精神和万隆精神作了这样大的贡献，她们将提高她们的警惕来使她们的儿童免受战争的恐怖，并且挫败那些奉行武力政策的人。在1957年的3月8日，妇女将发出主张遵守谈判、反对军事集团和主张各国友好的呼声。
    国际民主妇女联合会重申它同各妇女组织友好合作。它深信，更为密切的关系对于巩固已经获得的成就，对于更迅速地向共同目标前进，对于争取儿童的幸福、平等权利、人类的尊严和和平，将会比以前任何时候更加有效。
