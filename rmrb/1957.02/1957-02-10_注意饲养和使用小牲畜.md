    Pay Attention to Raising and Using Small Livestock
    In the past, Chinese farmers paid great attention to raising small livestock, regarding it as an important sideline occupation for the family. At the beginning of the agricultural cooperativization movement, some farmers thought that agricultural production cooperatives would not need so many small livestock, so they took them to the market to sell, which caused the price of small livestock to fall for a time. In the winter of 1955, the State Council issued instructions calling on agricultural cooperatives to take on all the small livestock, and many supply and marketing cooperatives also carried out the purchase and transfer of small livestock. This played a great role in stabilizing market prices and stopping the indiscriminate slaughter of livestock at that time. However, there are still many agricultural production cooperatives that have not paid enough attention to the breeding and management of small livestock. Therefore, we believe it is still necessary to draw the attention of rural cadres and agricultural cooperative cadres in various places.
    The reluctance of agricultural cooperatives to raise small livestock is related to some inappropriate publicity about agricultural mechanization. Many farmers thought that the days of "not using oil for lamps and not using cattle for plowing" would come soon. In some places, there was even a saying that "it doesn't matter if the cattle die, because we will have mechanization in the future." In fact, it will take a long time for China's agriculture to achieve mechanization; moreover, even in the distant future after mechanization is realized, there will still be many farm jobs that require animal power.
    According to statistics from 1949 to 1954, the number of draft animals in rural China increased by an average of about 7.3% per year, while in 1955 it only increased by 2.8% compared with 1954. This obviously cannot keep up with the needs of production development. Now, in many places, large draft animals are very expensive, and the shortage of draft animals is quite serious. If we do not find ways to protect the existing young livestock and small draft animals, and actively breed them, it will have an adverse impact on agricultural production.
    Of course, there will be some difficulties in using small livestock in cooperatives, because their farming ability is not great, but they still require labor and fodder. Raising small draft animals is obviously not as cost-effective as raising large draft animals. However, the development of agricultural production now requires more and more animal power. Expanding the multiple cropping index, applying more fertilizer, and deep plowing and careful cultivation all require more animal power. This situation should attract the general attention of all agricultural production cooperatives, and it is necessary to plan from a long-term perspective and step up the breeding of small livestock.
    Spring plowing is approaching. When arranging spring plowing production in various places, it is necessary to help each agricultural cooperative calculate the account of animal power. Land that cannot be plowed by large draft animals must be arranged to be plowed by small draft animals. Do not overburden large draft animals too much, so as to delay the farming season. Of course, with the same labor, the work done by small draft animals is not as much as that done by large draft animals. Therefore, the work quotas for using small draft animals and the remuneration for breeders should also be different from those for using large draft animals. It is necessary to ensure that the cooperative members who use small draft animals do not suffer losses.
    In the past, during individual management, farmers fed draft animals according to the amount of their own fields. Those with more fields raised large mules and horses and large cattle; those with fewer fields raised small donkeys and small cattle. Now, agricultural cooperatives in various places can also refer to the methods used by each household to use draft animals in the past, and divide most of the land for cultivation by large draft animals and a small part of the land for cultivation by small draft animals. This can ensure that all cultivated land can catch up with the plowing season, and large and small draft animals can each be used to their best advantage. When the agricultural cooperatives have bred more large draft animals in the future, they can gradually replace these small draft animals. Now, some places are not trying to arrange for the use of many small draft animals, but are sending people to other places to buy large draft animals. This impractical practice should be corrected.
    In the north and mountainous areas, small draft animals are very useful, and rolling mills, grinding grains, carrying goods, and traveling cannot do without them. In these places, after the agricultural cooperatives have made overall arrangements for large and small draft animals, if there are still surplus small draft animals, ask whether the cooperative members need them at home. If the cooperative members want to use them, they should be kept for the cooperative members, and if both the cooperative and the cooperative members have enough, the surplus part can be sold. Some places have adopted the method of public ownership, private feeding and private use for small draft animals distributed to cooperative members for their own use; some places sell them to cooperative members at a price, and the price is paid off in installments over several years; some are jointly raised and used by several households. These methods are feasible. All localities should actively think of more ways to breed draft animals, first of all, pay attention to the breeding and use of existing small livestock, so as to facilitate the development of agricultural production.

### 注意饲养和使用小牲畜

    注意饲养和使用小牲畜
    我国农民过去都很注意饲养小牲畜，把它当作一项重要的家庭副业。在农业合作化运动刚开始的时候，有些农民认为农业生产合作社要不了这么多小牲畜，就把小牲畜拿到市场上出卖，因而引起小牲畜的价格一度下跌。1955年冬国务院曾发出指示，号召农业合作社把所有的小牲畜包下来，许多供销社也进行了小牲畜的收购和调剂工作。这对于当时稳定市场价格、制止滥宰牲畜起了很大作用。但是，现在还有许多农业生产合作社对于小牲畜的饲养和管理，没有充分地加以重视。所以我们认为仍然有必要提起各地农村工作干部和农业合作社干部们的注意。
    农业社不愿意养小牲畜，和某些不恰当的关于农业机械化的宣传有关。有许多农民以为“点灯不用油、耕地不用牛”的日子很快就会来了。有的地方还出现了“耕牛死了也不怕，反正将来机械化”的说法。实际上我国农业要实行机械化还需要很长的时间；而且，即使在很远的将来实行了机械化以后，也还有很多农活是要用畜力的。
    我国农村的耕畜，据1949年到1954年的统计，平均每年约增加7.3％，而1955年只比1954年增加2.8％。这显然跟不上生产发展的需要。现在不少地方大耕畜价格很贵，耕畜不足的情况相当严重。如果再不设法把现有的幼畜和小耕畜加以保护，并且积极繁殖的话，就会给农业生产带来不利的影响。
    当然，在合作社里使用小牲畜会有一些困难，因为它们的耕作能力不大，却同样要花费人工草料。养小耕畜显然不如养大耕畜上算。但是，现在农业生产的发展对畜力的要求却越来越大。扩大复种指数、多施肥料、深耕细作等等增产措施都要多用畜力。这个情况应该引起所有的农业生产合作社的普遍注意，必须从长远的利益打算，加紧饲养小牲畜。
    现在春耕快到了。各地在布置春耕生产的时候，要帮助各个农业社算一算畜力的账。大耕畜耕不完的地，必须安排小耕畜去耕种。不要过分加重大耕畜的负担，以致贻误了农时。当然，同样的劳动力，用小耕畜所做的活不如用大耕畜做得多。因此，对于使用小耕畜的包工定额和对于饲养人员的报酬也要同用大耕畜的有所区别。要做到用小耕畜的社员不吃亏。
    在过去个体经营的时候，农民按照自己的田亩数量来喂耕畜。田多的养大骡马大牛；田少的养小驴小牛。现在各地农业社也可以参考过去各户使用耕畜的方法，划出大部分土地用大耕畜耕作，小部分土地用小耕畜耕作。这样可以使所有的耕地都能赶上耕种季节，大小耕畜又能各得其所。等到以后农业合作社的大耕畜繁殖得多了，就可以逐步地代替这些小耕畜。现在有的地方放着许多小耕畜不设法安排使用，却派人到别处去买大耕畜，这种不实际的做法应该纠正。
    在北方和山区，小耕畜很有用处，推碾、拉磨、驮运、赶路都离不了它。在这些地方，农业合作社把大小耕畜统筹安排以后，如果还有多余的小耕畜，要问问社员家中是不是需要。社员要用，就留给社员，社和社员都够用了，多出来的一部分可以出卖。分给社员自用的小耕畜，有的地方采取公有私养私用；有的地方是作价卖给社员，价款分几年还清；有的是几户伙养伙用。这些办法都是可行的。各地都应该积极地多想办法，繁殖耕畜，首先是注意饲养和使用现有的小牲畜，以利于农业生产的发展。
