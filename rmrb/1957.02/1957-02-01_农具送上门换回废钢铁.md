Farm Tools Delivered to Doors in Exchange for Scrap Steel

    (Our report) This reporter learned that the Luoyang Special District Iron Production Cooperative in Henan Province criticized the idea of solely relying on higher authorities to solve raw material problems. It actively organized personnel to deliver goods to the countryside and exchange them for farmers' accumulated scrap steel at reasonable prices. Farmers exchanged unwanted scrap steel for needed farm tools at fair prices, and the goods were delivered to their doorsteps, so they welcomed this approach. The Iron Production Cooperative also solved the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, ensuring normal production. According to statistics from fourteen counties and one Sanmenxia working area in the entire special district, from the third quarter of last year to early January this year, more than 6,389,000 jin of scrap steel have been recovered.

    农具送上门换回废钢铁
    本报讯　河南省洛阳专区铁业生产合作社批判了单纯依靠上级解决原料问题的思想，积极组织人员送货下乡，以合理的价格，换回农民积存的废旧钢铁。农民把不需要的废钢铁，换回了需要的农具，价钱公道，又是送货上门，因此都很欢迎这种做法。铁业生产合作社也解决了原料不足的困难，保证了正常生产。据全专区十四个县一个三门峡工区的统计，从去年第三季度到今年1月上旬，已收回废钢铁六百三十八万九千多斤。（胡宪宗）
