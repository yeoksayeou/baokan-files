Remembering the "February 28th" Uprising
Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Xie Xuehong
On the tenth anniversary of the Taiwan people's "February 28th" armed uprising, I mourn the heroic martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the "February 28th" struggle with immense sorrow! I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and pay my respects to the patriots!

Ten years ago, on February 28, 1947, the people of Taiwan Province, filled with boundless anger at the heinous conspiracy of American imperialism to invade Taiwan and the bloody rule imposed on them by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, finally took up arms and launched a heroic and magnificent struggle against the American invaders and the reactionary ruling clique in Taiwan. The people of the whole country—especially the people of Taiwan Province—will never forget this glorious "February 28th" armed uprising. Although the "February 28th" uprising was ultimately suppressed by the reactionary army wielding the bayonets and cannons of American imperialism, with its frenzy of slaughter, the people of Taiwan will never forget the glorious mission of the "February 28th" uprising: to defend the sacred territory of Taiwan from foreign invasion and to return Taiwan to the embrace of its motherland.

After Japan surrendered, the Chiang Kai-shek clique implemented policies that violated the interests of the country and the people. Domestically, it rejected all suggestions for peace and democracy from the Chinese Communist Party and the people, launched a large-scale civil war, and intensified its fascist rule. As a result, the people of the whole country, after a prolonged civil war and eight years of anti-Japanese war, were unable to rest and recuperate and restore the national economy, forcing them to plunge into a state of misery once again. Externally, it sold out national sovereignty, implemented the American imperialist policy of aggression against China, obeyed the dictates of American imperialism, and intensified the oppression and exploitation of the people. At this time, the people of Taiwan had just freed themselves from fifty years of enslavement under Japanese imperialism, ending the painful life of national oppression and colonialist trampling under Japanese imperialist colonial rule. They were overjoyed, thinking that they had finally returned to the embrace of the motherland and would surely be able to enjoy a life of national independence and democratic freedom together with the people of the whole country. However, the reactionary ruling clique that stepped into Taiwan began to discriminate against and insult the people of Taiwan as "conquerors." The reactionary ruling clique and bureaucratic capital colluded with each other, seized all the wealth plundered by Japanese imperialists in Taiwan for fifty years, inherited the entire apparatus and all the exploitative systems used by the Japanese rulers to oppress the people of Taiwan, and carried out even more cruel plunder and extortion of the people of Taiwan.

In October 1946, the reactionary ruling clique in Taiwan held secret consultations with American imperialists in Taipei to auction off Taiwan. From then on, American imperialism began to openly invade Taiwan. The American air and naval forces built military bases everywhere in Taiwan, and American monopoly capital invaded and gradually controlled important enterprises in Taiwan, with the whole of Taiwan gradually becoming a market for American goods. Facing the reactionary ruling clique's perverse acts and the colonial crisis, the people of Taiwan could not suppress their anger and hatred, and they shouted against fascist rule and American imperialist aggression against Taiwan. Soon afterwards, the "February 28th" uprising of the people of Taiwan broke out.

At that time, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yan'an expressed great concern for the armed uprising of the people of Taiwan. The Party's newspaper, the "Liberation Daily," began to publish news of the uprising of the people of Taiwan from March 6 onwards, and called on the people of the entire Liberated Areas to actively support the struggle of the people of Taiwan, especially calling on the Chinese People's Liberation Army to actively annihilate the enemy on the front lines in order to support the armed uprising of the people of Taiwan. The "February 28th" uprising temporarily failed under the historical conditions at the time, especially due to the savage suppression by the reactionary army. Tens of thousands of revolutionary patriots and innocent people were slaughtered; but the people of Taiwan did not succumb in the slightest, and indeed, could not succumb.

In June 1950, while launching the Korean War of aggression, American imperialism brazenly ordered its naval and air forces to carry out armed aggression against Taiwan, attempting to use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and shamelessly engaged in open aggression against our country's territory and interference in our country's internal affairs. In December 1954, the US government, disregarding the repeated warnings of our government and the resolute opposition of our people, actually signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, attempting to legalize its acts of aggression against Taiwan and plotting to use Taiwan as a base to expand its aggression against China, disrupt and provoke new wars. After the signing of the US-Chiang treaty, American imperialism further strengthened its military control over Taiwan, thus creating a tense situation in the Taiwan region and hindering the liberation of Taiwan, while the people of Taiwan lived an unprecedentedly miserable life under American military rule. Due to the plunder of American imperialism and the oppression of the reactionary ruling clique, Taiwan has become a desolate and terrifying living hell, and the people of Taiwan are plunged into deep suffering. Of the more than eight million people in Taiwan Province, as many as one million are starving. In Taipei County, which is relatively economically developed, there is an average of one beggar for every forty-one people. In Taichung County, there is an average of one poor person in need of relief for every four people. Many starving people starve to death or freeze to death, many starving people take the risk of committing theft, and many poor people have no way out and go crazy under the torment of life. It is reported that there are 100,000 mentally ill patients in the province. Taiwanese newspapers openly say that "madmen are in groups." Many starving people commit suicide or commit suicide as a whole family because they cannot make a living. A woman in Nantou County, overwhelmed by poverty and illness, and unable to survive the New Year, first poisoned her three-year-old child a few days before the Spring Festival, and then committed suicide by taking poison herself. In order to intensify the exploitation of the people, the reactionary ruling clique, in addition to the indiscriminate issuance of paper money causing continuous and huge increases in prices and the forced collection of exorbitant taxes, forcing the people to sell their children and wives, has deployed a net of heaven and earth consisting of troops, police, secret agents, party thugs, prisons and concentration camps throughout the province in order to suppress the people's resistance, implementing various "joint responsibility and joint guarantee systems," conducting so-called "general inspections" anytime and anywhere, and arbitrarily arresting and killing the people. In this hell shrouded in an atmosphere of terror, not only patriotic people and revolutionary patriots, but even poor people who are unable to pay donations, innocent people who are falsely accused, and even officers and soldiers in the Chiang army who are deemed suspicious and have homesickness are arrested. Taiwanese newspapers admit that the prisons and concentration camps in Taiwan are "crowded with prisoners," and therefore, they are building prisons on a large scale. Those arrested are subjected to mental and physical persecution and torture, and many people have no return, resulting in many people being ruined, their families destroyed, and their wives and children scattered.

However, the vast majority of the people of Taiwan, mired in suffering under the aggression of American imperialism, have not and will not become pessimistic and disappointed because of their current plight. They also know that one day they will be liberated, and they see a bright future like the people of the whole country. Inheriting the Chinese people's revolutionary tradition of loving democracy and freedom, and inheriting the patriotic spirit of the national hero Zheng Chenggong's recovery of Taiwan, the people of Taiwan will not succumb to foreign aggressors and willingly become colonial slaves. The people of Taiwan see that the US imperialist aggression against Taiwan is resolutely opposed by the people of the world, especially seeing the increasingly powerful motherland and the motherland people's warm concern for the people of Taiwan, and are convinced that Taiwan will surely be liberated. How moved and happy the people of Taiwan were when they heard the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties and People's Organizations of the People's Republic of China for the Liberation of Taiwan," and the repeated calls to the people of Taiwan by Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and others! The voices of relatives in the motherland and the care for the suffering of the people of Taiwan are like the five-star red flag already appearing before their eyes. The people of Taiwan are waiting so eagerly for liberation. In order to know the real situation of the motherland, the people of Taiwan must wage a sharp struggle against the reactionary ruling clique's strict blockade, but the people of Taiwan have indeed learned of many of the great achievements of the motherland's socialist construction. The people of Taiwan greatly admire the happy life of the people in the motherland, and they know how important the strength of the motherland and their own future are. From many facts, the people of Taiwan know how strong the national defense forces of the motherland are. The people of Taiwan are extremely concerned about the achievements of the motherland's industrial construction, knowing that the motherland is able to produce jet aircraft and automobiles, concerned about the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, and knowing when the Yingxia Railway will be completed. The people of Taiwan are convinced that the people of the motherland not only have the determination to liberate Taiwan, but also have the full potential to crush the US imperialist conspiracy to invade Taiwan and achieve the great task of liberating Taiwan. On the other hand, the people of Taiwan also see that in addition to the fact that the US imperialist aggression against Taiwan is opposed by peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the reactionary ruling clique in Taiwan is not only extremely isolated among the people of Taiwan, but also has many internal contradictions and difficulties. The financial crisis alone is bound to lead to its downfall, and some officers and soldiers within it who have some patriotic spirit are gradually realizing that continuing to follow American imperialism and oppose the motherland is a dead end, and therefore, they are expressing dissatisfaction with the American military rule in Taiwan. They see that the motherland is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, and are even more willing to return to the motherland as soon as possible to live a free and happy life. Everyone knows that "counterattacking the mainland" is just a dream from a few years ago. Due to the rapid growth of the peace forces of socialist countries and nationally independent countries around the world, and due to the great achievements of the motherland's socialist construction and the development and strength of its economy and national defense, these changes have promoted and created the conditions for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. The people of Taiwan feel even more encouraged and shout from the bottom of their hearts "Long live the motherland!"

The people of Taiwan fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's call in January 1956: "Taiwan compatriots and all personnel who have fled to Taiwan from the mainland, stand on the banner of patriotism, and together with the people of the motherland, strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the complete unification of the motherland!" and fully agree with what the People's Daily (February 4, 1956 editorial) said: "Taiwan compatriots! The motherland has sent you a warm call, asking you to work for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, to make Taiwan return to the motherland. The motherland is very concerned about your current difficult situation and is working hard to liberate you as soon as possible. The motherland is waiting for you to participate in the great socialist construction and participate in the extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done." Yes, the people of Taiwan are extremely willing to dedicate their greatest strength according to this call of the motherland. The people of Taiwan are willing to work hard to strive for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    回忆“二·二八”起义
    台湾民主自治同盟主席　谢雪红
    在纪念台湾人民“二·二八”武装起义十周年的时候，我以万分沉痛的心情悼念“二·二八”斗争中英勇牺牲的烈士！向烈士们的家属致以亲切的慰问，并向志士们致敬！
    十年前，即1947年2月28日，全台湾省人民对于美帝国主义侵略台湾的罪恶阴谋和蒋介石集团对台湾人民所施行的血腥统治感到无比愤怒，忍无可忍，终于拿起武器向美国侵略者和在台湾的反动统治集团展开了英勇壮烈的斗争。全国人民——特别是全台湾省人民永远也不会忘记这一次光荣的“二·二八”武装起义。虽然“二·二八”起义在手持着美帝国主义的刺刀枪炮的反动军队的疯狂屠杀下终被镇压下去；但台湾人民永远也不会忘记“二·二八”起义的光荣任务——保卫祖国领土台湾不受外国侵犯，使台湾回到自己祖国的怀抱。
    在日本投降后，蒋介石集团实行违反国家和人民利益的政策：对内，拒绝中国共产党和全国人民的一切和平、民主的建议，发动大规模内战，全面进攻解放区，加紧施行其法西斯统治，以致全国人民在长期国内战争和八年抗日战争后得不到休养生息、恢复国民经济的机会，迫使人民重新陷入涂炭的惨境；对外，出卖国土主权，执行美帝国主义侵略中国的政策，听从美帝国主义的指使，加紧压迫和剥削人民。这时，台湾人民刚从日本帝国主义五十年的奴役下摆脱出来，结束了在日本帝国主义殖民地统治下受尽民族压迫和殖民主义蹂躏的惨痛生活，欢欣鼓舞地以为终归回到了祖国的怀抱，必定能够同全国人民一起享受民族独立和民主自由的生活。可是，踏进台湾的反动统治集团一开始就以“征服者”的姿态来歧视和侮辱台湾人民。反动统治集团和官僚资本互相勾结，劫收了日本帝国主义者五十年来在台湾掠夺的全部财富，继承日本统治者压榨台湾人民的整套机构和全部剥削制度，对台湾人民进行更加残酷的掠夺和榨取。
    在台湾的反动统治集团于1946年10月就在台北与美帝国主义者举行秘密会商，拍卖台湾。从此美帝国主义开始公开侵略台湾，美国海、空军在台湾到处建设军事基地，美国垄断资本侵入并逐渐控制台湾重要企业，整个台湾逐渐成为美国商品的市场。台湾人民面对着反动统治集团的倒行逆施和殖民地化危机，抑压不住满腔的愤怒和仇恨，发出了反对法西斯统治，反对美帝国主义侵略台湾的吼声，不久就爆发了台湾人民的“二·二八”起义。
    当时在延安的中国共产党中央，对台湾人民的武装起义表示了极大的关怀。党的机关报“解放日报”在3月6日以后，就陆续发布台湾人民起义的消息，并号召全解放区人民积极声援台湾人民的斗争，尤其号召中国人民解放军在前线积极消灭敌人，以支援台湾人民的武装起义。“二·二八”起义在当时的历史条件下，特别由于遭到反动军队的野蛮镇压暂时失败了，成千上万的革命志士和无辜人民被屠杀了；但台湾人民丝毫也没有屈服，而且是不能屈服的。
    美国帝国主义于1950年6月在发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，悍然命令它的海、空军武装侵略台湾，企图以武力阻止中国人民解放台湾，无耻地公开进行侵略我国领土和干涉我国内政。1954年12月，美国政府不顾我国政府的多次警告和我国人民的坚决反对，竟同蒋介石集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图使它侵略台湾的行为合法化，并阴谋以台湾为基地扩大对中国的侵略、破坏和挑拨新的战争。在美蒋条约签订以后，美帝国主义就进一步加强它对台湾的军事控制，因而造成了台湾地区的紧张局势和阻碍了台湾的解放，而台湾人民即在美国的武力统治下过着空前无比的悲惨生活。由于美帝国主义的掠夺和反动统治集团的压榨，台湾成为一座凄凉恐怖的活地狱，台湾人民陷于水深火热的苦难中。在台湾省八百多万人口中，饥民竟达一百多万，在经济较为发展的台北县，平均四十一个人中，就有一个乞丐，在台中县平均约四个人中，就有一个需要赈济的贫民。许多饥民饿死、冻死，许多饥民冒险而为盗窃，许多贫民走头无路受不了生活的折磨而发疯，据悉全省精神病患者达十万人，台湾报纸公开说“疯人成群”。许多饥民因无法度日而自杀或实行全家自杀。南投县一妇女因贫病交迫，难过年关，在春节前几天先毒死亲生的三岁幼儿，然后自己服毒自杀。反动统治集团为要加紧榨取人民，除了滥发纸币造成物价不断巨涨和强迫征收苛捐杂税，迫使人民卖子鬻妻而外，为了镇压人民的反抗，在全省布置军队、警察、特务、党棍、监狱、集中营的天罗地网，实行各种“连坐连保制度”，随时随地进行所谓“总检查”，随意滥捕滥杀人民。在这个笼罩着恐怖气氛的地狱里，不但那些爱国人士和革命志士，连那些无力缴纳捐款的贫民，被诬陷的无辜人民，以至在蒋军部队中被认为有嫌疑、有思念家乡情绪的官兵都遭逮捕。台湾报纸承认在台湾的监狱、集中营“犯人拥挤”，因而大肆兴建监狱。被捕者均遭精神上和肉体上的迫害和折磨，许多人有去无返，因而许多人因此家破人亡妻离子散了。
    可是，在美帝国主义侵略下，陷于水深火热中的台湾人民绝大多数并没有而且也不会因为眼前的苦境而悲观失望，他们也知道总有一天会得到解放的日子，也看到有和全国人民一样的美好前途。继承着中国人民热爱民主自由的革命传统，并继承着民族英雄郑成功收复台湾的爱国主义精神的台湾人民，是不会屈服于外国侵略者而甘愿当殖民地奴隶的。台湾人民看到美帝国主义侵略台湾的行为遭到全世界人民的坚决反对，尤其看到日益强大起来的祖国，和祖国人民对台湾人民的亲切关怀，确信着台湾是一定会解放的。当台湾人民听到“中华人民共和国各民主党派、各人民团体为解放台湾联合宣言”，以及毛泽东主席、周恩来总理等屡次对台湾人民召唤的时候，是多么感动和高兴呀！祖国亲人的呼声，对台湾人民疾苦的关照，像在眼前已经出现了五星红旗，台湾人民是这样殷切地等待着解放。台湾人民为了要知道祖国的真实情况，必须同反动统治集团的严密封锁进行尖锐的斗争，但台湾人民的确也获悉了祖国的许多社会主义建设的伟大成就的消息。台湾人民是很羡慕祖国人民目前的幸福生活的，他们知道祖国的强大和自己的前途是有着多么重大的关系。从许多事实中，台湾人民知道祖国国防力量是多么强大。台湾人民极其关心祖国工业建设的成就，知道在祖国已能够生产喷气式飞机和汽车，关心长江大桥的建设情况，知道鹰厦铁路什么时候完成铺轨。台湾人民确信祖国人民不但有决心要解放台湾，而且是完全有可能粉碎美帝国主义侵略台湾的阴谋，实现解放台湾的伟大任务的。另一方面，台湾人民也看到除了美帝国主义侵略台湾的行为遭到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的反对而外，在台湾的反动统治集团不但在台湾人民中已经是极其孤立的，而且它的内部也极矛盾，困难重重。只因财政危机也要造成它必定垮台，而在它的内部有点爱国精神的官兵也逐渐认清了继续追随美帝国主义而与祖国作对是没有出路的，因而对美国在台湾的武力统治表示不满。他们看到祖国日益强盛，更加愿意早日回到祖国过自由幸福的生活。“反攻大陆”谁都知道只是几年前的梦想。由于世界社会主义国家和民族独立国家的和平力量迅速壮大，由于祖国社会主义建设的伟大成就和经济、国防力量的发展、强大，这些形势的变化，促成了和出现了和平解放台湾的条件，台湾人民更加感到振奋，并从心里喊出了“祖国万岁”！
    台湾人民完全拥护周恩来总理1956年1月发出的“台湾同胞和一切从大陆上跑到台湾的人员，站到爱国主义旗帜下来，同祖国人民一起，为争取和平解放台湾、实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗吧！”的号召；并完全同意人民日报（1956年2月4日社论）所说的：“台湾的同胞们！祖国已经向你们发出了热情的召唤，要求你们为台湾的和平解放、为使台湾归还祖国而努力。祖国十分关怀你们目前的痛苦处境，并且正在为使你们早日得到解放而努力。祖国在等待着你们参加伟大的社会主义建设，参加我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”是的，台湾人民是极其愿意按照祖国的这个召唤，献出自己最大的力量的。台湾人民愿意为争取和平解放台湾而努力。
