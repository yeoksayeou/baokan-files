Northern Kunqu Opera Begins Public Performances in Beijing Today

Kunqu Opera, which has experienced several periods of prosperity and decline, will meet Beijing audiences again. The Northern Kunqu Opera Troupe will begin public performances starting from the 10th.

The cast participating in the performance is remarkably complete, featuring the renowned Northern Kunqu Opera performing artists Han Shichang (Dan), Bai Yunsheng (Xiaosheng), Hou Yongkui (Wusheng), Ma Xianglin (Dan), Hou Yushan (Hualian), Bai Yuzhen (Hualian), Wei Qinglin (Laosheng), and Meng Xiangsheng (Xiao Hualian). Twenty years ago, they were all famous for a time, and countless audiences were captivated by their superb performing arts. As they have aged, their performing arts have become even more mature. This time, they will all perform their signature pieces. Li Shujun, a young female actress who attracted attention from the music circle for singing folk songs at the first National Music Week held last year, will also participate in the performance, playing Zhaojun in the Kunqu Opera "Leaving the塞 (Sai) Border," which she recently learned. In addition, young actors who are just beginning to show their talents, such as Kong Zhao, Cong Zhaohuan, Zhang Fengling, Liu Xiuhua, Hou Changzhi, An Weili, Cui Hao, Lin Ping, and Wang Juan, will also showcase their skills to Beijing audiences.

Kunqu Opera has a history of nearly five hundred years. It was first created by Wei Liangfu, an outstanding opera musician from Kunshan in the Ming Dynasty. It was introduced to Beijing during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty and soon occupied the leading position in the opera scene. By the Qing Dynasty, it was popular throughout the country, from the court to the countryside. During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, there were as many as fifty or sixty Kunqu Opera troupes in the area from Beijing to Baoding alone. Later, due to the fact that men of letters and scholars of all dynasties regarded Kunqu Opera as an elegant pursuit for showing off their talents and pleasing their moods, it became detached from the masses, and gradually declined.

Northern Kunqu Opera art experienced a period of prosperity after Han Shichang and other excellent actors came to Beijing in 1917, but after 1939, it tended towards silence. At that time, some of the old artists switched to performing Peking Opera, some returned to their hometowns to farm, and some made a living by doing small business. For more than ten years, Kunqu Opera almost disappeared from the Beijing stage. It was not until after liberation that Jin Ziguang, the former vice president of the Beijing People's Art Theater, and others found them one by one and brought them back to Beijing for a short period of public performances. Later, the old artists were invited by performing arts groups in Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places to serve as classical dance teachers, making great contributions to the cultivation of a new generation of dance talents. Last November, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Dramatists Association held a grand "Kunqu Opera Observation Performance" in Shanghai. The Northern Kunqu Opera actors organized a Northern Kunqu Opera delegation to participate in the performance, which was unanimously praised by the literary and art circles and the southern audience.

Currently, the Ministry of Culture is preparing to establish a specialized Northern Kunqu Opera art research and performance group based on this delegation. Now, all that can be seen in the delegation is an atmosphere of establishing a career. As soon as you step into that small courtyard, you either hear young female actors practicing singing to the melodious flute music, or you see young martial artists practicing sparring in the courtyard in the severe cold. Some of the old artists are energetically pointing out their successors, while others are seriously reviewing old tunes. The old artists have all said that they are very excited to meet the Beijing audience again after a long absence; they are also rejoicing that the art of Northern Kunqu Opera will shine again.

### 北方昆剧今天开始在京公演

    北方昆剧今天开始在京公演
    几经盛衰的昆剧又将和北京观众见面了——北方昆剧代表团从10日起开始公演。
    参加演出的演员阵容是如此的整齐：有久负盛名的北方昆剧表演艺术家韩世昌（旦）、白云生（小生）、侯永奎（武生）、马祥麟（旦）、侯玉山（花脸）、白玉珍（花脸）、魏庆林（老生）和小花脸孟祥生。他们在二十年前都曾名重一时，有无数观众为他们高超的表演艺术倾倒。随着年岁的增长，他们的表演艺术也愈加成熟，这次，他们都将演出自己的拿手好戏。在去年举行的第一届全国音乐周上演唱民歌而引起音乐界重视的青年女演员李淑君，也将参加演出，在她新近学会的昆剧“出塞”中扮演昭君。另外还有孔昭、丛兆桓、张凤翎、刘秀华、侯长志、安维黎、崔浩、林萍、王卷等初露头角的青年演员，也将在北京观众面前一显身手。
    昆剧已有近五百年的历史，它是明代杰出的戏曲音乐家、昆山人魏良辅首创的。在明代万历年间传入北京，不久便在剧坛上占了首座。到了清代，上至宫庭，下至乡村，风行全国，在乾隆、嘉庆年间，仅北京到保定一带地区，就有五、六十个昆曲班社。后来由于历代文人墨客把昆剧当作逞才怡情的雅事，造成脱离群众的现象，以至逐渐衰落。
    北方昆曲艺术从1917年韩世昌等优秀演员来到北京以后，又曾一度繁荣，到1939年之后趋向沉寂。那时老艺人们有的改演京戏，有的回故乡种地，有的做小买卖糊口，十多年来昆剧几乎在北京舞台上绝迹。直到解放后，才由前北京人民艺术剧院副院长金紫光等人把他们一一找回北京，作了短期公演。以后，老艺人们分别应北京、天津和武汉等地表演艺术团体的聘请，担任古典舞蹈教师，对培养新生一代的舞蹈人才有很大贡献。去年11月间，上海市文化局和中国戏剧家协会上海分会在上海举办了一次盛大的“昆剧观摩演出”，北方昆剧演员们组织了北方昆剧代表团参加演出，得到文艺界和南方观众一致的推崇。
    目前，文化部准备以这一代表团为基础，成立专门性的北方昆剧艺术研究、表演团体。现在一到代表团看到的尽是兴家立业的气象。只要跨进那个小小庭院，不是听见青年女演员们在和着悠扬的笛声练唱，就是看见小武生们冒着严寒在院子里练习对打。老艺人们有的精神抖擞地在指点着自己的后继者，有的在认真地重温旧曲。老艺人们都表示能和阔别已久的北京观众重新会面很兴奋；他们也为北方昆曲艺术又将重放光采而庆幸。
