    Excessive Purchase and Sale Price Difference of Southern Vegetables Operated by Vegetable Companies in Changchun and Other Places
    Guangdong Province has a surplus of vegetables due to its four distinct seasons. According to central instructions, large quantities of Guangdong vegetables are to be transported to major northern cities during the winter. However, recently, representatives of the vegetable companies in northern sales areas have been jointly suppressing prices in Guangdong in order to seek high profits, which has affected the production enthusiasm of vegetable farmers in Guangdong Province.
    The purchase and sale price difference of these vegetables operated by the sales area companies is too large. For example, the retail price of spinach in Changchun is 39 cents per jin, and in Beijing it is 37 cents per jin; while the delivery price per jin at the railway car in Guangdong is 7.5 fen, and the transportation and packaging miscellaneous fees are no more than 6 fen per jin. In this way, the gross profit of the sales area companies reaches more than 2 jiao per jin! While in the producing areas, the purchase price of each county can only be 5 fen per jin due to the need to deliver the goods in railway cars. Another example is chives, the delivery price per dan at the railway car in Guangdong is 8 yuan, but the retail price in Tianjin is 1.02 yuan per jin, a difference of more than ten times! The price difference for other varieties also reaches four or five times.
    Guangdong Province produces many varieties of vegetables, but the sales area companies only purchase a few kinds. Guangdong county companies once suggested that sales area companies increase the transportation of more than a dozen kinds of vegetables in the form of trial sales and consignment sales, and the sales were also very good; but the sales area companies only want four varieties such as yuán jiāo (round peppers) and purple eggplant; for other varieties, they only want them when there is a small amount of goods on the market, and they don't want them when there are a lot of goods, while also suppressing grades and prices. They suddenly urge Guangdong county companies to ship large quantities of goods, and after the county companies transport the goods to Guangzhou, they rush to take the goods if there are few goods, and push them away if there are too many, arguing back and forth, delaying the train schedule. Or they are excessively picky, leaving the vegetables at the station to be exposed to wind and rain, and failing to inspect them for several days, eventually causing them to rot in large quantities.
    The above-mentioned issues have been met with serious protests from Guangdong county companies, but they have not attracted the attention of the sales area company representatives and the Guangdong Provincial Company, and the problem continues to occur. I urgently request the relevant departments to thoroughly investigate and quickly stop this wrong practice. Wu Yuanheng

### 长春等地蔬菜公司经营南菜购销差价太大

    长春等地蔬菜公司经营南菜购销差价太大
    广东省四季盛产蔬菜，供过于求。根据中央指示，冬季把广东的蔬菜大量运往北方各大城市。但是，近来北方各销区蔬菜公司派驻广东的代表联合压价，为的是牟取高利，影响了广东省菜农的生产情绪。
    销区公司经营这些蔬菜的购销差价过大。如长春每市斤菠菜的零售价是三角九分，北京的是三角七分；而在广东车厢交货价为每市斤七分五厘，运费及包装杂费每市斤不超过六分。这样，销区公司的毛利达到每市斤二角多！而产区则由于要在车厢交货，各县的收购价就只能是每市斤五分钱。又如韭菜，在广东车厢交货价每市担八元，天津零售价却是每市斤一元零二分，差价达十倍多！其他品种的差价也都达到四、五倍。
    广东省出产的蔬菜品种很多，但销区公司只来购少数几种。广东各县公司曾经建议销区公司以试销代销方式增运了十几种菜，销路也很好；但销区公司只要元椒、紫茄等四个品种；对其他品种，上市货少就要，货多就不要，同时压级压价。他们忽而催促广东各县公司大量来货，待各县公司把货运到广州后，货少他们就抢要，多了就推，争来争去，耽误车期。或是过分挑剔，把菜放在车站任风吹雨淋，几天也不验收，最后大量霉坏。
    上述种种，虽经广东各县公司提出严重抗议，都没有引起销区公司代表们和广东省公司的注意，问题还在继续发生。我迫切要求有关部门彻底检查一下，迅速制止这种错误做法。　伍元亨
