    Financial Research Institute of the People's Bank of China Headquarters Holds Meeting to Discuss
    Whether the Renminbi Has the Function of a Store of Value

    At the beginning of this year, the Financial Research Institute of the People's Bank of China Headquarters convened a scientific discussion meeting on the issue of the monetary functions of the Renminbi. The meeting mainly focused on the new situation of currency circulation in our country and discussed whether the Renminbi has the function of a store of value.

    Since the high tide of socialist transformation in early 1956, some changes have taken place in the laws of currency circulation nationwide. The most prominent manifestation is that farmers are hoarding large amounts of Renminbi. According to surveys and estimates, about one-third of the currency in rural areas nationwide may be in a state of hoarding, forming a "sedimentation" phenomenon of currency. Studying the reasons for the Renminbi sedimentation phenomenon, especially exploring whether this phenomenon is the result of the store of value function being exerted, has important practical significance for banking work. This is because currency in the role of store of value should generally not be included in the necessary amount of currency in circulation. If the Renminbi does not have the function of a store of value, then in organizing currency issuance, it is necessary to consider taking correct organizational measures for the current sedimented currency, such as vigorously organizing savings, recovering currency, and preparing sufficient commodities to prevent this part of the currency from impacting the market.

    Regarding the question of whether the Renminbi has the function of a store of value, there are two different opinions in the discussion.

    One opinion is: The Renminbi is different from ordinary banknotes and past banknotes, but is a type of credit currency symbol under socialist economic conditions. Banknotes cannot perform the function of a store of value. However, the Renminbi is different from ordinary banknotes. Because the purchasing power of the Renminbi has long-term stability and has won a high reputation among the people of the country, people are happy to store it; the Renminbi is the only means of circulation in the country, and the "Gresham's Law" cannot take effect; our country neither needs gold and silver circulation, nor does it allow other currency substitutes to circulate, so if we want to preserve value with a general equivalent that can purchase any commodity, we can only hoard the currency symbol—the Renminbi; at the same time, with the development of monetary relations in rural areas and the increase in the degree of commodification of agricultural products, as well as the annual increase in farmers' income, farmers are accumulating savings according to the principle of "cultivating three acres and saving one," therefore, it is an inevitable economic law for people to save money. This has formed the economic reason for farmers hoarding currency in the past two years and will continue to do so in the future.

    In theory, it can also be inferred that the currency performing the function of a store of value does not necessarily have to be concrete "gold and silver." Marx pointed out when analyzing the conditions for the emergence of the store of value function of currency: "The function of hoarding currency arises partly from the function of currency as a means of domestic circulation and means of domestic payment, and partly from the function of currency as world money. In the latter function, there must be real monetary commodities, that is, concrete gold and silver." Marx only emphasized that the store of value as a reserve of world money must be real gold and silver, while the store of value prepared as a means of domestic circulation and payment means that it does not necessarily have to be real gold and silver. Since the Renminbi can replace gold coins in circulation to perform the functions of means of circulation and means of payment, then it can also replace gold coins to perform the function of store of value that arises on the basis of the first two functions.

    Marx's analysis of the necessary amount of currency is calculated based on the total price of commodities to be realized, that is to say, the necessary amount of currency in circulation is limited to the currency of means of circulation and means of payment that participate in the realization of commodities, and does not include the currency of the store of value. Then, in actual work, when considering the turnover of commodities and the necessary amount of currency in circulation, the currency balance stored in the hands of residents must be deducted. In this way, when the bank controls currency issuance, it must make appropriate issuance in addition to the necessary amount of currency in circulation to realize the total price of commodities, in order to meet the needs of storage and prevent the stagnation of national construction funds due to currency sedimentation.

    Another opinion believes that the sedimented currency should not be understood as the store of value function of currency. The reason is: the causes of the currency sedimentation phenomenon, in addition to the basic stability of prices in recent years and the increased monetary income of farmers after the development of the commodification of agricultural products, and the corresponding increase in the amount of currency held by farmers, there is also another aspect: due to the state's management of the market, the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton, and oil, makes it so that the currency flowing into the hands of farmers may not be quickly withdrawn; at the same time, in the high tide of agricultural socialist transformation, farmers have various concerns about the use of currency, which prompts some currency to be in a state of hoarding, this phenomenon is not necessarily completely normal, and it cannot be said that the Renminbi truly has the function of a store of value because of the superiority of the socialist system. Furthermore, the phenomenon of storing banknotes is not only found in socialist societies, but also in capitalist societies where US dollars and pounds are stored. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there was also storage of puppet French currency. Therefore, the superiority of the current socialist system cannot be used as a reason to explain that the Renminbi has the function of a store of value. Since storing currency is storing wealth, it cannot be replaced by any arbitrary currency symbol. From the essence of the store of value, it cannot be inferred that because currency symbols can replace currency to perform various other functions, they can also replace currency to perform the function of a store of value; this inference is not scientific enough. Because the storage function is not artificially formed, it must unconditionally and indefinitely perform this function, but the Renminbi must be attached with many conditions before it can be talked about the possibility of storage, even if it can be stored, it cannot be stored indefinitely like gold and silver for a long time. The Renminbi has many natural shortcomings that make it unsuitable for storage, such as being burned by fire and chewed up by rats, which will inevitably affect the preservation of true value.

    The currency currently retained in the hands of residents, regardless of the length of time it is retained, should be regarded as standby currency, as a reserve for means of circulation. It should not be regarded as a store of value function simply because the time between buying and selling is prolonged. The meaning of circulation is broad, and it cannot be said that the money kept in the hands of residents for a certain period of time has withdrawn from the circulation sphere. Due to the sedimentation of currency, it is cyclical and not fixed in terms of region; in terms of time, it is also impossible for everyone's currency income to increase every year, or never be spent, it is very likely that it will be sedimented this year and spent all next year. Therefore, when calculating the necessary amount of currency in circulation, it should be included as a standby fund for means of circulation. If it is not included in the necessary amount of currency in circulation, and a corresponding amount of currency is issued again, it will inevitably cause the amount of currency in circulation in society to be greater than the amount of goods turnover needed, which will promote price increases and inflation, thereby affecting the pace of our socialist construction, which is extremely dangerous.

    In addition, during the discussion, everyone also raised questions about the concept of store of value, the division between storage and savings, and the relationship between sedimentation and storage, which need to be further discussed and studied.

### 人民银行总行金融研究所开会讨论  人民币有没有贮藏手段的机能

    人民银行总行金融研究所开会讨论
    人民币有没有贮藏手段的机能
    今年年初，人民银行总行金融研究所召开了一次关于人民币的货币机能问题的科学讨论会。会上主要针对当前我国货币流通的新情况，讨论了人民币有没有贮藏手段机能问题。
    自从1956年初，社会主义改造高潮以来，全国货币流通规律发生了一些变化。其中突出地表现为，农民大量收藏人民币，据调查估计，目前全国农村货币量中可能有三分之一左右是处于收藏状态，形成货币的“沉淀”现象。研究造成人民币沉淀现象的原因，特别是研讨这种现象是否为货币的贮藏机能所发挥的作用，对于银行工作具有重要的实践意义。因为，处于贮藏手段机能作用中的货币一般是不应计算在货币流通必要量内的。如果人民币并没有贮藏手段机能，那末，在组织货币发行工作时，就需要考虑对当前沉淀的货币采取正确的组织措施，如大力组织储蓄，收回以及准备足够的商品，以防备这部分货币冲击市场等。
    对于人民币有没有贮藏手段机能问题，在讨论中有两种不同的意见。
    一种意见是：人民币不同于一般的纸币，也不同于过去的银行券，而是社会主义经济条件下属于信用货币类型的货币符号。纸币是不能执行贮藏手段机能的。但是人民币却不同于一般的纸币。由于人民币的购买力具有长期的稳定性，在全国人民中已赢得了高度的威信，人民都乐于贮藏它；人民币又是全国范围内唯一的流通手段，“劣币驱逐良币律”不可能发生作用；我们国家既不需要金银流通，又不准许其它货币代用品流通，所以想用能购买任何商品的一般等价物来保存价值，就只有收藏货币符号——人民币；同时，农村中货币关系的发展和农产品商品化程度的提高，以及农民收入逐年增加，农民们都按照“耕三余一”的原则进行积蓄，因而，人民保存货币就成为必然的经济规律了。这就形成农民近两年来并在今后仍将继续收藏货币的经济原因。
    在理论上，也可推断执行贮藏手段机能的货币不一定完全是具体的“金和银”。马克思在分析货币贮藏手段产生的条件时就曾指出：“货币贮藏的机能，一部分是由货币充作国内流通手段和国内支付手段的机能发生，一部分是由货币充作世界货币的机能发生。在后一种机能上，必须有现实的货币商品，那就是具体的金和银”。马克思只强调了作为世界货币准备金的贮藏手段必须是现实的金和银，而作为国内流通手段和支付手段的准备的贮藏手段，就意味着不一定非要现实的金、银不可。既然人民币在流通中，可以代替金币执行流通手段和支付手段机能，那末，它也就可以代替金币执行在前两种机能基础上产生的贮藏手段机能。
    马克思关于货币必要量的分析，是以待实现的商品总价格来计算的，也就是说流通中货币必要量，只以参加商品实现的流通手段和支付手段货币为限，并不包括贮藏手段的货币。那末，在实际工作中，考虑商品流转和货币流通必要量时，就得把贮藏在居民手中的货币余额扣除。这样在银行掌握货币发行时，就须在实现商品总价格的货币流通必要量之外，再作适当的发行，以适应贮藏需要和不使因货币沉淀而影响国家建设资金的周转不灵。
    另外一种意见认为，沉淀的货币不应该作为货币的贮藏手段机能来理解。理由是：货币沉淀现象产生的原因，除了几年来物价基本上稳定和农产品的商品化有了发展后，农民的货币收入有所增加，农民持有货币量应有增加这一些正常因素外，还有另一方面：由于国家对市场的管理，粮、棉、油料实行了统购统销政策后，使货币流入农民手中不一定很快回笼；同时又在农业社会主义改造高潮中，农民对于使用货币有种种顾虑，这就促使一部分货币不得不处于收藏状态，这种现象不一定是完全正常的，不能说人民币因为社会主义制度的优越性而真正具有了贮藏手段机能。再则，保存纸币的现象不仅在社会主义社会才有，在资本主义社会里也有保存美金和英镑的。在抗日战争以前也有保存伪法币的。所以不能以目前社会主义制度的优越性为理由来说明人民币有贮藏手段机能。贮藏货币既然是贮藏财富，那就不能以任意的货币符号来代替。从贮藏手段的本质来看，不能因为货币符号可以代替货币发挥其它种种机能，因而也可以代替货币发挥贮藏手段的机能，这种推论是不够科学的。因为贮藏机能不是人为形成的，它要无条件地无限期地执行这一机能，但是人民币则要附加很多条件才能谈到贮藏的可能，即使能贮藏也不是无限期地当作黄金和白银似地长期贮藏下去。人民币有很多天然的不适宜于贮藏的缺点，如火可以焚烧，鼠可以咬碎，这必然会影响真正价值的保存。
    目前保留在居民手中的货币，不管其保留的时间长短，都应该看成是待用的，作为流通手段的准备金。而不应该仅从买与卖之间的时间拖长了就算作是贮藏手段机能。流通的意义是广义的，不能说在一定时间内保存在居民手中的钱是退出了流通界。由于货币的沉淀，在地区上是循环的，不固定的；在时间上，也不可能每人每年货币收入都增加，或永远不用出去，很可能这一年是沉淀，下一年就花光了。所以在计算货币流通必要量时，应把它作为流通手段备用金来计算在里面。如果不把它计算在货币流通必要量内，并且相应地再发行一部分货币，则必会造成社会上货币流通量大于商品流转需要量，促使物价上涨，通货膨胀，从而影响及我国社会主义建设步调，这是极端危险的。
    另外，在讨论中，大家还提出了关于贮藏手段的概念问题，贮藏和储蓄的划分问题，沉淀同贮藏的关系问题等，有待继续讨论研究。
