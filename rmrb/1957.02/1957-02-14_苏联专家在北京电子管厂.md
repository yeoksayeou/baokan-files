    Soviet Experts at the Beijing Electron Tube Factory
    Zhang Quan

    We learned many stories about how Soviet comrades helped the workers of the Beijing Electron Tube Factory learn production technology as soon as we entered the factory.

    What deeply moved people was the Soviet comrades' enthusiasm and selfless, concrete guidance to the factory's workers. In Workshop No. 10, there was a young worker named Zhang Mingcheng, only twenty years old. He had neither made tungsten filaments thinner than a strand of hair nor had he ever seen such complex technology. Moskova, the Soviet expert working in this workshop, explained the machine's structural principles to him in detail and personally demonstrated the operation several times in a row. Once, Zhang Mingcheng made a tungsten filament that was 0.40 instead of 0.012. Moskova immediately pointed out his mistake: "The important thing is to adjust the speed and pay attention to the heating." Zhang Mingcheng followed her instructions, and after dozens of practice runs, he was indeed able to make tungsten filaments. Now, he has skillfully mastered the entire production process and has become the leader of a technical team.

    Zhou Tianguang, deputy director of Workshop No. 2, said: "It's not just one person who has learned the technology with the help of Soviet comrades; in our workshop alone, there are three hundred people." Workshop No. 2 is the electron tube assembly workshop, where the technology is particularly delicate and meticulous. Some processes require working under a magnifying glass. Initially, when more than three hundred young men and women first came here from junior high school, they were intimidated by this complex technology and couldn't help but ask the Soviet experts: "Can we learn it?" The Soviet expert Babushkina encouraged them: "As long as you are determined, you are guaranteed to learn it." Babushkina and Valya, among others, were in the workshop from morning to night. They were either demonstrating operations or running to the workers' sides to patiently guide them, and they used the method of master teaching apprentice to pass on advanced experience to the workers. One day, Hu Shufang assembled an electron tube incorrectly, and she was so anxious that she couldn't even eat. Valya quickly called her to her side, demonstrated for her, and said to her: "Assemble each part with special patience and care. You must grasp the dimensions and ensure vacuum and hygiene." After more than a month of learning, Hu Shufang learned to assemble frame electron tubes. Now, she can assemble more than thirty a day.

    Soviet comrades also humbly learned from the experience of Chinese workers. Last December, technician Dong Dawei installed an accessory on the exhaust machine, allowing the electron tubes to automatically fall into the fixture on the electromagnetic vibrating frame. Then, he installed a time-delay relay on the vibrating frame to automatically stop it, which reduced one person's workload. Although this was not a shocking creation, Milinikov carefully studied Dong Dawei's technical reform. He praised it, saying, "This is applicable to production and should be adopted. We will also implement this method when we return to the Soviet Union."

    What is particularly moving is the noble quality of Soviet comrades in opposing waste and saving wealth for China. Zhou Tianguang, deputy director of Workshop No. 2, talked about the following story: In November 1956, the rejection rate of a certain type of electron tube rose to 17% during testing. Many people were checking, but they could not find the cause. At this time, the Soviet expert Batuueva felt very sad. She went deep into the workshop every day and patiently checked every part. After checking for a week, she found that the workers had not done a good job of hygiene during operation, and small fibers had fallen in, causing obstacles. Therefore, Batuueva emphasized the importance of doing a good job of hygiene, such as keeping clothes clean and covering semi-finished products with glass covers... As a result, the rejection rate was reduced to 5.6%.

    The Beijing Electron Tube Factory is a newly established factory, and there are many difficulties in all aspects; however, with the help of Soviet experts, these difficulties have been overcome. For example, in the past, the frame assembly platform in Workshop No. 3 often had problems, sometimes almost exploding and sometimes having no current, directly affecting production. After seeing this situation, Oleg, the Soviet expert working in this workshop, and the old worker Sergeyev always felt uneasy. Since then, they have put their minds to work and actively modified the original equipment, lengthening the current circuit so that it can be applied to a certain type of electron tube. In less than half a year, those accidents on the original frame assembly platform gradually disappeared. When people praised Sergeyev for his courage to overcome difficulties, he replied to his Chinese comrades: "Your business is our business, and your difficulties are our difficulties."

    Now, the Soviet comrades have returned to their country one after another, but people will always remember them.

    苏联专家在北京电子管厂
    张泉
    我们走进北京电子管厂，就了解到许多关于苏联同志帮助这个厂的工人学习生产技术的故事。
    使人们深受感动的是苏联同志对于厂里工人的热情和无私的具体指教。在十号车间里，有一个只有二十岁的青年工人张明城，他既没有制造过比头发丝还细很多的钨丝，也从未见过这种复杂的技术。在这车间工作的苏联专家莫斯柯娃，向他详细地讲解机器构造原理，又连续几次亲自进行操作表演。有一次，张明城做出的钨丝不是0.012，而是0.40了，莫斯柯娃立即向他指出毛病：“重要的问题是在于调整速度，注意加温。”张明城按照她的教导，经过几十次实习后，果然能够制造钨丝了。现在，他已经熟练地掌握全部生产过程，并且当上了技术小组长。
    二号车间副主任周天广说：“在苏联同志帮助下，学会技术的不是一个人，仅我们车间的就有三百人。”二号车间是电子管装配车间，这里的技术特别精巧细致，有几道工序需要在放大镜下才能工作。开始，当三百多青年男女刚从初中学校来到这里的时候，他们被这种复杂的技术吓住了，禁不住向苏联专家问：“我们能学会么？”苏联专家巴布施金娜就鼓励他们：“只要下决心，保证能学会。”巴布施金娜和娃丽亚等，从早到晚都在车间里，她们是在示范操作，或者跑到工人身边耐心指教，并且用师傅带徒弟的方法，向工人们传授先进经验。一天，胡淑芳把电子管装坏了，她急得连饭也吃不下去。娃丽亚连忙把她叫到身旁，一边做给她看，一边就对她说：“装每个零件都要特别耐心仔细，既要掌握分寸尺度，又要保证真空卫生。”胡淑芳经过一个多月的学习，就学会了装架电子管。现在，她每天能装三十多个了。
    苏联同志同样虚心地学习中国工人的经验。去年12月，技术员董大为在排气机上装一个附属用具，使电子管自动落入电磁振动架的装具上，然后又在振动架上装了一个延时继电器，使它自动停车，这样就可以减少一个人工作。虽然这不是什么惊人的创造，但是米里尼柯夫却认真地研究了董大为在技术上的改革，他赞扬说：“这是适用于生产的，应该采用，我们回到苏联也将实行这种办法。”
    使人们特别感动的是苏联同志反对浪费、为中国节约财富的高贵品质。二号车间副主任周天广谈了这样一个故事：1956年11月间，有一种电子管在试验时废品率上升到17％，许多人都在检查，但始终找不出原因。这时，苏联专家巴都也娃心里十分难过，她每天深入车间，耐心地检查着每一个零件；直到检查了一个星期，她发现工人们在操作时，没有做好卫生工作，使细小的纤维落进去了，因而产生了障碍。因此，巴都也娃强调提出了做好卫生工作的重要，比如，衣服要清洁，半成品要用玻璃盖好……，这样做的结果，使废品率降低到5.6％。
    北京电子管厂是一个建立不久的工厂，在各方面都有着许多困难；但是，在苏联专家帮助下，这些困难被战胜了。比如说，过去三号车间的装架台上常常发生毛病，有时几乎焊炸，有时就没有电流，直接影响了生产。在这车间工作的苏联专家奥列克和老工人谢尔盖也夫看到这种情形以后，心里总感到不安。从此，他们开动脑筋，积极改装了原有设备，把电流线路改长，使它能适用于某一种电子管。在不到半年的时间里，原来装架台上的那些事故就逐渐被消灭了。当人们称赞谢尔盖也夫勇于克服困难的时候，他回答中国同志说：“你们的事情就是我们的事情，你们的困难就是我们的困难。”
    现在，苏联同志已陆续回国了，但是人们永远怀念着他们。
