    Yunnan Broadcasting Undertaking Has Great Development

    (Our Newspaper News) The rural broadcasting network in Yunnan Province has greatly developed. Currently, there are forty-four rural wired broadcasting stations already broadcasting in the province, possessing five thousand six hundred and thirty-four loudspeakers. The majority of the loudspeakers are installed in the production teams of agricultural cooperatives. Fifteen additional broadcasting stations are under construction, with the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture broadcasting station partially completed. Soon, the Dai people here will be able to hear programs broadcast in the Dai language. There are one thousand two hundred and eighty-five radio stations in the province. Based on current listening conditions, it is estimated that over one million farmers can listen to the radio.

    The development of rural broadcasting has enlivened the cultural life of the countryside and facilitated ideological education for the peasant masses. In many areas, Party committees use the broadcasting stations to explain the Party's policies, current central tasks, and other issues to the masses.

    The broad masses of farmers love the radio, calling it a "living newspaper." Farmers in some areas report that broadcasting has five benefits: first, it allows them to hear instructions from higher levels; second, they can hear domestic and international news; third, they can hear weather forecasts; fourth, they can exchange experiences; and fifth, men, women, young, and old can all receive education.

    云南广播事业有很大发展
    本报讯　云南省农村广播网有很大发展。现在全省已经播音的农村有线广播站有四十四个，拥有喇叭五千六百三十四支，大部分喇叭都安在农业社的生产队里。还有十五个广播站正在施工，其中部分完工的有西双版纳傣族自治州广播站。不久，这里的傣族人民就可以听到用傣族语言广播的节目。全省有收音站一千二百八十五个。按现有的收听条件估计，可以供一百万以上的农民听广播。
    农村广播事业的发展，活跃了农村的文化生活，便利向农民群众进行思想教育。不少地区的党委在广播站向群众讲解党的政策，当前的中心工作和其它各种问题。
    广大农民热爱广播，他们称广播为“活报纸”。有的地区的农民反映广播有五好：一可以听上级指示，二可以听国内外新闻，三能听天气预报，四能交流经验，五是男女老少都能受到教育。
