    Swiftly Curb Gambling

    To the Editor:
    Recently, serious gambling has occurred in rural areas of Shaodong and Shuangfeng counties in Hunan Province. In Shaodong County, more than 880 people have participated in gambling in 24 townships, including Xujiapu and Shangcheqiao. In Shuangfeng County's Guangchong Township, 46 out of 61 households in the Fenshui Agricultural Cooperative have participated in gambling. The majority of these gamblers are members of agricultural cooperatives, except for a few who are idle professional gamblers.
    Many people have lost money gambling, which has affected their family life. Xu Xiaosheng, a young member of the Central Agricultural Cooperative in Xujiapu Township, Shaodong County, lost money gambling and had no food to eat, and his wife was threatening to divorce him. Some farmers have even lost the relief funds they received from the government. Some who have lost money have even resorted to crimes such as embezzlement and theft in order to continue gambling. For example, Zhou Taiping, an accountant at the Songjiatang Township Agricultural Cooperative in Shaodong County, embezzled 40 yuan of military dependents' relief funds to gamble after losing 120 yuan in cash. Deng Yunzhang, a member of the Jiangheqiao Township Agricultural Cooperative, stole his neighbor's clothes and more than 100 jin of sweet potatoes from the agricultural cooperative to pay off his debts after losing money.
    Gambling has also seriously affected agricultural production. For example, some members of an agricultural cooperative in Shuangkou Township, Shaodong County, were keen on gambling last winter, which affected the completion of the pond and dam repair plan. The Central Agricultural Cooperative in Xujiapu Township also delayed the sowing of five mu of wheat because of this.
    Gambling is an absurd act of speculation, and if this trend becomes popular in rural areas, it will be very harmful to farmers' production and life as well as social order. We hope that the relevant units will quickly correct it.

### 迅速制止赌风

    迅速制止赌风编辑同志：
    近来，湖南省邵东、双峰等县农村中发生了严重的赌博现象。邵东县徐家铺、上车桥等二十四个乡中参加赌博的有八百八十多人，双峰县光冲乡分水农业社六十一户中参加赌博的就有四十六户。这些赌博的人，除个别人是不务正业的惯赌分子外，绝大部分的人都是农业社的社员。
    许多人赌输了钱，影响了家庭生活。邵东县徐家铺乡中心农业社青年社员徐小生赌输了，没有饭吃，妻子闹着要和他离婚。有些农民把从政府领来的救济款也都输光了。还有些输了钱的人，为了继续赌博竟走上贪污、偷盗的犯罪道路。如邵东县宋家塘乡农业社会计周太平在输了一百二十元现款以后，就盗用四十元军属救济款又去赌博；蒋和桥乡农业社社员邓云章输了钱后，就偷了邻居的衣服和农业社的一百多斤红薯去还债。
    赌博还严重地影响了农业生产，如邵东县双口乡某农业社去年冬季有一部分社员贪图赌博，因而影响了整修塘坝计划的完成。徐家铺乡中心农业社也因此耽误了五亩麦子下种。
    赌博，是一种投机取巧的荒唐行为，这种风气如果在农村中流行，对于农民生产和生活以及社会秩序为害很大，希望有关单位迅速加以纠正。
