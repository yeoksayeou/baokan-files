Changchun (By Our Own Correspondent) The eighteen companies (stations) under the Changchun Municipal Bureau of Commerce have initially resolved the problems of overlapping institutions and overstaffing. According to the plans of each company (station), sixty-eight sections (units), stores, and district companies will be reduced and merged. At the same time, according to needs, it is planned to add Muslim stores, veterinary drug outlets, and expand the operations of some stores of department stores and trading companies to meet market needs. In terms of personnel, according to preliminary calculations from sixteen companies (stations) alone, 306 cadres can be transferred to strengthen grassroots units. Nine companies (stations) have already abolished and merged institutions, and transferred 63 cadres to strengthen grassroots units.

However, because some personnel have insufficient understanding of grassroots work, they are not only unwilling to work as salespersons, but also unwilling to be assigned to grassroots administrative work. Some leading cadres have varying degrees of departmentalism and are unwilling to transfer stronger cadres outward. The commercial department is strengthening ideological education to solve these problems.

    长春商业系统各公司
    精简管理机构加强基层工作
    本报讯　长春市商业局所属十八个公司（站）初步解决了机构重叠、人浮于事的问题。根据各公司（站）的计划，将要削减和合并六十八个科（股）室、商店及区公司，同时按需要准备增设回民商店、兽药门市部，并扩大百货、贸易公司部分商店的经营，以适应市场需要。在人员方面，仅据十六个公司（站）初步计算，可调出三百零六名干部充实到基层单位里去。现在已经有九个公司（站）撤销和合并了机构，抽调了六十三名干部充实到基层单位去。
    但由于部分人员对基层工作认识不足，不仅不愿意做营业员工作，就是分配到基层做行政工作也不愿意。有的领导干部存在不同程度的本位主义思想，不愿意往外调较强的干部。商业部门正通过加强思想教育，解决这些问题。
