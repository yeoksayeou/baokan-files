    "Ascend Another Level"
        Dù Líjūn
    The Tang Dynasty poet Wang Zhihuan has a famous five-character quatrain:
    "The white sun leans on the mountain's edge and vanishes,
    The Yellow River flows into the sea.
    To exhaust a thousand miles in view,
    Ascend another level."
    With just twenty characters, it vividly and graphically depicts the scene of climbing a height by the river for a distant view. Truly the work of an artist!
    I am reminded of life from this poem.
    When we stand in a relatively high place, we can see far. For example, when we climb to the highest peak of Fragrant Hills, "Ghost Worry," the dozens of miles of Beijing's misty scenery are clearly visible and completely unobstructed. Facing the magnificent mountains and rivers of our motherland, singing to our hearts' content, we immediately feel broad-minded and harmonious.
    When we look at life from the heights of socialism, when we consider problems from the perspective of the revolutionary interests of the entire people, our eyes will see far, and we will be brave enough to overcome temporary difficulties. The more we think from a long-term perspective, the more joyful our spirit will be.
    Gorky said: "I often repeat this sentence: the higher a person's goal, the faster his talent develops, and the more effective he is for society. I regard this as a truth. This truth is determined by my entire life experience, that is, everything I have observed, read, compared, and deeply considered."
    Lying on the ground, one can only see a few feet away. People with a narrow view can only see a little bit of personal interest in front of their noses.
    To see far, one must climb high. If you want to "exhaust a thousand miles in view," you must "ascend another level"!

    “更上一层楼” 
        杜黎均
    唐代诗人王之涣有一首著名的五言绝句：
    “白日依山尽，黄河入海流。
    欲穷千里目，更上一层楼”。
    仅仅二十个字，就鲜明而形象地描绘出在河边登高望远的情景。的确是艺术家的手笔！
    我从这首诗联想到生活。
    当我们站在比较高的地方的时候，我们就可以看得远。比方说吧，我们爬到香山最高峰“鬼见愁”，数十里京华烟云，历历在目，一览无余。我们面对祖国雄伟山河，尽情高歌，顿感胸襟开阔，其乐融融。
    当我们从社会主义的高处来看待生活的时候，当我们从全人民的革命利益的角度来考虑问题的时候，我们的眼睛就会望得远，我们遇到暂时的困难也就会勇于去克服。越从远大处着想，我们的精神也就越愉快。
    高尔基说：“我常常重复这一句话：一个人努力的目标越高，他的才力就发展得越快，对于社会就更有效果。我把这点当作真理。这真理是经过我全部的生活经验、即我的观察、阅读、比较和深思熟虑过的一切所确定下来的。”
    躺在地上，只能望见几尺的距离。眼光如豆的人，只能看到自己鼻子前面的一点点个人利益。
    望远，必须登高。你要“欲穷千里目”，必须“更上一层楼”！
