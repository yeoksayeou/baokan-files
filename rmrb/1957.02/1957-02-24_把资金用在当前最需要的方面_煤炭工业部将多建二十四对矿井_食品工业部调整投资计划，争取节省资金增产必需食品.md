Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd. China's state-owned coal industry will build twenty-four more pairs of mine shafts with a total annual output of 7.73 million tons, and two coal washing plants with a total annual output of 3 million tons this year, without increasing national investment. The funds needed for the construction of these newly added mine shafts and coal washing plants came from the Ministry of Coal Industry's recent adjustment of this year's basic construction plan, which minimized investment in various secondary projects that could be postponed or cancelled.

Although China's coal output has increased from 63.52 million tons in 1952 to 105.3 million tons in 1956, it still cannot keep up with the country's needs. In the future, with the development of the national economy, the demand for coal will be even greater. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase the construction of mine shafts and coal washing plants.

In this adjustment of the plan, the Ministry of Coal Industry implemented the central government's spirit of "building the country with diligence and thrift," and first made a significant reduction in investment in non-productive construction. Except for the currently urgently needed 1.3 million square meters of housing for coal mine workers nationwide, which will remain untouched, office buildings and guest houses will be built as little as possible. Administrative management expenses have also been greatly reduced. The Xi'an Coal Mining Administration, which was originally planned to be moved to Lanzhou this year, will not be moved this year. The establishment of a new mining bureau in the Yongchuan and Rongchang areas of Sichuan, which was originally planned for this year, will also not be established. The preparatory organizations for new factories and mines in Taiyuan, Baotou, and other places have also been scaled down. This will save a lot of money.

Investment in culture, education, and scientific research has also been appropriately adjusted in accordance with the principles of economy and steady progress. Considering that under China's current conditions, the most economical and effective way to train new workers in the future is still to rely on production factories and mines for on-site training, technical schools will no longer be expanded this year. After merging the duplicate experimental research projects originally planned to be launched this year by the three scientific research institutions in Beijing, Tangshan, and Fushun, not only will financial resources be saved, but also technical strength will be concentrated and effectively used.

In terms of productive investment, after in-depth research and balancing, the arrangements are also more appropriate and reasonable than originally planned. The Bentun vertical shaft in Benxi is planning to increase coal production by 250,000 tons this year compared to last year, which requires an additional 200 coal cars. After careful calculation, only 100 additional cars are needed. The Datong and Tongchuan mining areas will jointly use a single repair factory for production and basic construction departments, so the two repair factories originally planned to be built in these two mining areas this year can be saved. Some transportation and mining equipment such as combines, coal cutters, and electric locomotives that are currently needed for production and are being purchased from abroad, although the investment has already been listed, it has been reduced in order to avoid the accumulation of funds, considering that the goods will not arrive.

After the adjustment, in addition to increasing the construction of the aforementioned mine shafts and coal washing plants, in order to increase coal production as soon as possible, investment will also be appropriately increased for some mine shafts that can be put into production earlier or can increase output. In this way, it is estimated that 1.5 million tons more coal will be produced in 1958 than originally planned.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd. The Ministry of Food Industry has recently rearranged this year's investment plan. The implementation of this plan will not only increase the production of food needed by the people and raw materials needed by the national industry but also save a lot of funds.

The Ministry of Food Industry originally planned to use a portion of the investment to prepare for and build the Yangjiang Sugar Factory, Pingnan Sugar Factory, Huaibei Washing Salt Field, and the expansion project of the Zhengzhou Oil Factory for the Second Five-Year Plan. However, these projects were originally planned to be put into production in 1959, so it is still possible to postpone the investment to 1958. Most of the non-productive projects originally planned to be built this year, such as the school buildings, office buildings, warehouses, and research institutes of secondary technical schools, will not affect production if they are temporarily not built, and it has been decided not to build them this year. The Ministry of Food Industry has also made appropriate modifications to the projects that have already been under construction, based on the actual needs of national industrial production and people's lives. For example, Zigong City has built four salt wells in the previous four years, which can basically meet the local market's demand for edible salt, so the plan to build ten salt wells this year has also been modified.

As a result of the above project modifications, investment can be saved in large quantities.

In order to ensure the food needed by the people and the chemical raw materials needed by the country, the Ministry of Food Industry has studied in detail the project items that need investment this year and decided to concentrate most of the investment on salt, sugar, wine, and other food industries that are urgently needed by the country and people's lives. For example, it has been decided to continue building and restoring the salt flats in Huaibei, Yingkou, and Fuzhou Bay this year. After completion, the production of edible salt can be increased by more than 500,000 tons. It has been decided to continue building the Zhongshan and Nanhai large sugar factories with a total annual output of more than 80,000 tons, which can be completed and put into production this year. In addition, it has been decided to expand the Qingdao and Beijing breweries, Beijing Winery, and Food Factory No. 1 within the year, and only a small amount of investment and a small amount of equipment need to be added to increase the production capacity of more than 2,500 tons of beer, more than 2,100 tons of fruit wine, and 2,100 tons of canned fruit, respectively.

    把资金用在当前最需要的方面
    煤炭工业部将多建二十四对矿井
    食品工业部调整投资计划，争取节省资金增产必需食品
    新华社23日讯　我国国营煤炭工业今年在不增加国家投资的情况下，将比原计划多建设二十四对年产量共七百七十三万吨的矿井和两座年产量共三百万吨的选煤厂。这些新增加的矿井和选煤厂建设所需要的资金，是煤炭工业部最近在调整今年基本建设计划中，尽量地压缩了各种次要的、可以缓办或不办的项目的投资中得来的。
    我国煤炭的产量虽然已从1952年的六千三百五十二万吨提高到1956年的一亿零五百三十万吨，但是煤炭的产量仍然赶不上国家的需要。今后，随着国民经济的发展，煤炭的需要量还更大。因而，迫切需要增加矿井和选煤厂的建设。
    煤炭工业部在这次调整计划中，贯彻中央指示的“勤俭建国”的精神，首先对非生产性建设的投资做了很大的压缩。除了对原计划为全国煤矿职工建设的目前急需的一百三十万平方公尺的住宅还保持不动外，对办公楼房和招待所都尽量不盖。行政管理费用也大大削减。原打算今年迁到兰州去的西安煤矿管理局，今年不搬了。原计划今年在四川永川和荣昌地区新成立一个矿务局，也不成立。太原、包头等地新建厂矿的筹备机构也加以缩小。这样就可以节约不少钱。
    对文教和科学研究的投资也本着节约和稳步前进的原则，进行了适当的调整。考虑到在我国的现实条件下，今后培养新工人的经济有效的方法主要还是依靠生产厂矿在现场代训，因而今年就不再扩建技工学校了。北京、唐山和抚顺三个科学研究机构原来计划今年开办的性质重复的试验研究项目经过合并以后，不仅节约了财力，而且技术力量也得到了集中有效的使用。
    在生产性投资方面，经过深入研究和平衡以后，也比原来安排得更得当合理。本溪采屯竖井今年计划比去年增产二十五万吨煤，需要增加煤车二百辆，经过仔细核算，只要增加一百辆就够用了。大同和铜川两个矿区生产和基本建设部门共同使用一个机修厂，这样今年计划在这两个矿区建设的两个机修厂就可以省掉。有些目前为生产上需要的从国外购置的运输采掘设备如康拜因、割煤机和电机车等，投资虽然已经列上，但是考虑到货到不了，为了避免资金积压，也把它削减了。
    经过调整以后，除了增加上述的矿井和选煤厂的建设外，为了尽快地增产煤炭，对于一些能够提前投入生产或能够提高产量的矿井，在投资上也要适当地增加。这样，估计1958年将比原计划多生产一百五十多万吨煤炭。
    新华社23日讯　食品工业部最近重新安排了今年的投资计划。实行这个计划既能增产人民需要的食品和国家工业需要的原料，又能节省很多的资金。
    食品工业部原来计划用一部分投资为第二个五年计划筹建和兴建阳江糖厂、平南糖厂、淮北洗涤盐场以及郑州油厂等扩建工程。但是这些工程原计划要到1959年才能投入生产，因此，推迟到1958年投资也来得及。原来计划在今年兴建的中等技术学校校舍、办公楼、仓库和研究所等大部非生产工程，暂时不建也不影响生产，决定今年不建了。对已经施工的工程，根据国家工业生产和人民生活实际需要，食品工业部也作了适当的修改。如自贡市在前四年中已经建成四个盐井，基本上能够满足当地市场对食盐的需要，因此原定要在今年建成十个盐井的计划也作了修改。
    以上工程修改的结果，投资可以大量节省。
    为了保证人民需要的食品和国家所需要的化工原料，食品工业部详细研究了今年需要投资的工程项目，决定把大部投资集中用在国家和人民生活急需的盐、糖、酒和其他食品工业方面。如决定今年续建和恢复的淮北、营口、福州湾的盐滩，建成后就可以增产食盐五十多万吨。决定续建的中山、南海两个共年产八万多吨的大型糖厂，在今年内就能建成投入生产。另外，决定在年内扩建的青岛和北京啤酒厂、北京酿酒厂、食品一厂，只需要增加少量的投资，增添少量设备，就可以分别增加两千五百多吨啤酒和两千一百多吨果子酒、两千一百吨水果罐头的生产能力。
