    I am Willing to Go to the Grassroots Level
    Cai Fu'en
    I was very happy to hear that the higher authorities decided to transfer me to work in the countryside. Since I served as the Deputy Minister of the Production Cooperation Department of the Tie嶺 County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Liaoning Province, I and many comrades have had a common feeling: although the work is very tiring, we have not made much achievement. Tracing the root cause, I think this is largely related to the weakness of the leadership at the grassroots level in the townships.
    When the district-level organizations were abolished, many leading cadres were transferred to work in the county. Most of the township work was done by the original village cadres. They used to lead only one village, but now they have to lead a whole township, which is indeed very difficult for them. Although the county-level departments are equipped with a lot of leading cadres, most of them are trapped in the circle of affairs and cannot go deep into the townships to do concrete leadership work, relying only on issuing documents, instructions, and bulletins. This not only does not help the work of township cadres, but also fosters bureaucracy in the leading organs.
    It is difficult to ensure the completion of rural work tasks when the leadership at the township level is weak. In order to solve this problem, the county party committee has to frequently transfer cadres from various departments to organize work teams to go to the countryside. Each transfer is very difficult and causes dissatisfaction in various departments. Moreover, most of the cadres transferred are not familiar with the work, so they are not at ease and do not do their work well. What's more, in the past year, due to the weakness of grassroots leadership, the county has not been able to see reports from below for a long time, and the situation and problems in rural work cannot be grasped and resolved in a timely manner. Once, the county party committee assigned tasks to the cadres working in the countryside, but because they did not understand the situation, they proceeded solely from subjective wishes and deviated from reality, resulting in many adverse consequences.
    In order to reverse this situation that is detrimental to work, the county party committee recently decided to transfer a group of leading cadres to strengthen the grassroots level, which is very necessary. Only by doing so can we strengthen the leadership of agricultural cooperatives and overcome bureaucracy in leadership. For the sake of the Party's interests and the people's interests, I am willing to go to the grassroots level. I am determined to overcome all the difficulties that going to the countryside may bring me, strive to study the Party's policies and guidelines, humbly learn from the working experience of local cadres, closely contact the masses, work diligently, and strive to build a new socialist countryside.

    我愿意到基层去
    蔡福恩
    听到上级决定调我到乡里工作，我很高兴。自从我担任中共辽宁省铁岭县委生产合作部副部长以来，我和许多同志都有一个共同的感觉：工作虽然很累，却没做出多少成绩。追起根来，我认为这与乡基层组织领导力量的薄弱有很大的关系。
    区级机构撤销时，许多领导骨干都被调到县里工作，乡的工作大部分都由原来的村干部担任。他们过去仅仅领导一个村，现在，一下子就要领导一个乡，工作确实很吃力。县级各部门虽然配备了不少的领导干部，但大部分都陷到事务圈子里，不能深入到乡去做具体领导工作，只靠发文件指示、通报办事。这样不但对乡干部的工作帮助不大，还滋长了领导机关的官僚主义。
    乡级的领导力量差，要保证农村工作任务的完成，是有困难的。为了解决这个问题，县委只得经常从各部门抽调干部组织下乡工作队。抽调一次费劲很大，惹得各部门都有意见，而且抽下去的干部大部分业务不熟悉，因此不安心，工作也做不好。这还不算，一年来，由于基层领导力量薄弱，县里很长时间看不到下面的报告，农村工作中的情况和问题都不能及时掌握、解决。有一次，县委向下乡工作干部布置任务，就因不了解下情，单从主观愿望出发，脱离了实际，产生了许多不良后果。
    为了扭转这种对工作不利的情况，县委最近决定抽调一批领导骨干充实基层，这是非常必要的。只有这样做，才能加强对农业合作社的领导，才能克服领导上的官僚主义。为了党的利益，人民的利益，我愿意到基层去。我决心克服下乡给我带来的一切困难，努力钻研党的方针政策，虚心向当地干部学习工作经验，密切联系群众，兢兢业业，为建设社会主义新农村而奋斗。
