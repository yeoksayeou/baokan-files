Xinhua News Agency, Xining, February 2nd. In the oil exploration areas of the Qaidam Basin, Spring Festival couplets in bright red are pasted on the doors of the various mobile homes and earth-and-wood structured bungalows. Drilling workers tie red paper flowers to the derricks as people joyously celebrate the Spring Festival.

Thousands of drilling workers in exploration areas like Mang'ai and Lenghu who persist in winter construction continue with drilling operations during the Spring Festival. After getting off work, they take off their work clothes covered in mud and put on new clothes, going to various prepared cultural venues to enjoy dramas, ballad singing, cross-talk and other programs performed by the workers themselves. Many workers also participated in Spring Festival basketball, volleyball and table tennis matches.

In the houses of the more than twenty newly married couples who married in Qaidam, well-wishers come and go all day long during the Spring Festival. Everyone feels as happy as celebrating the Spring Festival in their hometown, forgetting the severe cold of twenty or thirty degrees below zero here.

Party and government leaders of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau celebrated the Spring Festival with the workers. They offered greetings to the workers of each drilling team and also visited the sick wards in the hospital with gifts to comfort the injured and sick.

    春节在柴达木
    新华社西宁2日电　在柴达木盆地的石油探区，各幢活动房屋和土木结构的平房门上都贴着大红春联，钻工们在井架上系着红纸花，人们喜气洋洋地欢度春节。
    茫崖、冷湖等探区坚持冬季施工的几千名钻工，春节期间继续进行着钻井工作。他们下班后脱去沾满泥浆的工作服，换上新装，到各个准备好的文艺场所欣赏职工们自己演出戏剧、曲艺、相声等节目。许多职工还参加了春节篮、排球和乒乓球赛。
    在柴达木结婚的二十多对新婚夫妇的房子里，春节中成天熙熙攘攘来往着祝贺的客人。大家感到像在家乡欢度春节一样地快乐，忘掉了这里已是零下二三十度的严寒。
    青海石油勘探局的党、政负责人和职工们一起欢度春节。他们慰问了各钻井队的职工，还带着慰问品到医院病房慰问伤病员。
