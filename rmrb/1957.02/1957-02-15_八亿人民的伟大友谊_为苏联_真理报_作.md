The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, signed on February 14, 1950, is a historical symbol of the great friendship between the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union. Over the past seven years, the continuous consolidation and development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union have played a significant role in promoting the development of both countries' construction endeavors, safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, and promoting the cause of human progress. Without a doubt, in the future lives and practices of the two peoples, the content of this cooperative relationship will become even richer, and its role will become even more important. Therefore, on the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Chinese people, like the Soviet people and all peace-loving people around the world, are celebrating this great festival with great satisfaction and joy, and are rejoicing for the common prosperity of China and the Soviet Union.

While celebrating this festival, we are pleased to see that the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, have achieved many new successes in the magnificent cause of communist construction. After successfully completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in 1955, the Soviet people, with unparalleled labor enthusiasm, overfulfilled the first annual plan of the Sixth Five-Year Plan in 1956. The total industrial output value in 1956 increased by about 11% compared with 1955. Agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with the total grain harvest increasing by about 20% compared with 1955, and the production of many advanced collective farms and state farms has already reached the targets that should be achieved by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. New developments have also been made in various fields such as science, technology, culture and education. With the development of production, the material and cultural life of the Soviet people has become richer and more colorful. These achievements have greatly strengthened the strength of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, and at the same time eloquently demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. While hailing the achievements made by the Soviet people, the Chinese people sincerely wish the Soviet people continued and greater achievements in the cause of communist construction.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Government, the Chinese people have also made significant achievements in socialist construction and socialist transformation. The cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts in our country has been basically completed, and capitalist industry and commerce have also realized the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, and the socialist enthusiasm of the people has been unprecedentedly high. The total industrial output value in 1956 increased by about 25% compared with 1955, and although agriculture suffered serious disasters, output still increased. These achievements make it possible for us to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan and lay a good foundation for the Second Five-Year Plan. We believe that as long as we unite as one, work hard, learn modestly, and maintain the style of diligence and thrift, and hard work, we will be able to build China into a socialist industrial country in the period of three five-year plans or a longer period.

The achievements of the Chinese people are inseparable from the support and assistance of the Soviet people. The Chinese people have not only learned many valuable things from the Soviet revolutionary experience, but also from the Soviet experience in building socialism. Especially in the socialist construction of our country, the Soviet people and the Soviet government have given us multifaceted and fraternal assistance. Over the past few years, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other related agreements, the Soviet Union has helped our country restore its national economy and develop socialist construction through preferential loans, development of trade, supply of complete sets of equipment and technical data, dispatch of experts, and scientific, technological and cultural cooperation. In April 1956, the Soviet government decided to help our country build 55 new industrial enterprises in addition to helping our country build 156 projects. These industrial enterprises are the center of our country's socialist construction, and their completion will greatly change the long-term backwardness of our country. In terms of scientific and technological cooperation, according to the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement, the cooperation between our two countries in this area has been strengthened year by year, and the number of cooperative projects has also increased year by year. China and the Soviet Union have sent a large number of investigation experts, interns, and students to each other. Especially in 1956, when our country put forward the task of marching towards science, in order to help our country develop science, the Soviet Union sent excellent Soviet experts to help our country formulate a long-term plan for the development of scientific research, and also helped our country develop research work on the peaceful use of atomic energy. Through these assistance from the Soviet Union, it will be possible for our country to get rid of the backward state of science and technology in a relatively short period of time and reach the level of advanced science and technology in the world. In terms of cultural cooperation, in 1956, according to the increasing development of cultural cooperation between the two countries, China and the Soviet Union signed the first cultural cooperation agreement, and recently formulated the 1957 cultural cooperation implementation plan, further strengthening the planning of cultural cooperation between our two countries. The Chinese people are very grateful for the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet people, and will continue to strengthen the research and study of the advanced experience of Soviet construction. The Chinese people will always work together with the Soviet people to develop our mutual friendly cooperation in order to promote the common upsurge of the construction undertakings of our two countries.

It should be particularly pointed out that recently, at the invitation of the Soviet government, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai paid a friendly visit to and held talks with the Soviet Union. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, attach great importance to the results of this meeting. Soon, Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, will visit our country. We firmly believe that the mutual visits and talks between the leaders of the two countries will create new conditions for further developing and strengthening the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, thereby making new contributions to promoting the construction undertakings of the two countries and world peace.

Thanks to the solidarity, cooperation and mutual support of the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of socialist countries, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has been continuously consolidated and strengthened, and has become the most powerful pillar of world peace and human progress. Precisely because of this, the imperialist aggressive forces have been trying to subvert socialist countries and undermine the unity between socialist countries by various means. The Chinese people know from their own experience that as long as they rely on the unity of the broad masses of the people, thoroughly expose the enemy's conspiracies and resolutely fight against them, any enemy's rampant attacks can be defeated.

While celebrating the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we are particularly pleased to see the new development of unity among the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. Socialist countries have a common ideological basis and a common goal of building communism. The relations between them are based on the principles of Marxist-Leninist proletarian internationalism and complete equality of all nations. The "Declaration on the Basis of Developing and Further Strengthening the Friendship and Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Other Socialist Countries" issued by the Soviet government on October 30, 1956, fully embodies these principles. Recently, the Soviet Union, China and other socialist countries have successively held a series of comradely bilateral or multilateral talks, adjusted and strengthened the friendly and cooperative relations with each other, further strengthened the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and made new and great contributions to repelling the enemy's rampant attacks against socialism, against peace, and against the people. In this regard, the close unity of the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union is an important part of the unity of socialist countries. The Chinese people will always work together with the Soviet people and the people of other socialist countries to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp.

In the international arena, China and the Soviet Union have unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and have been making great efforts to maintain peace and ease international tensions together with the peace-loving people of the world. We insist on continuing to develop relations between countries according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, insist on solving all international disputes through peaceful consultation, insist on replacing aggressive military blocs with collective security systems, resolutely oppose colonialist acts of aggression, and resolutely advocate disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction. Thanks to the efforts of our two countries and peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the international situation has been eased repeatedly. However, the imperialist aggressive forces are always unwilling to see this easing. Whenever the international situation is somewhat eased, they desperately step up the Cold War and carry out aggressive expansion. But past facts have proved that as long as we are vigilant and fight resolutely, any conspiracy of international reactionary forces can be defeated, and the wheel of history will not go backwards. The Chinese people will continue to work together with the Soviet people and the peace-loving people all over the world to make unremitting efforts for the lasting peace of the world.

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
Long live the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!

    八亿人民的伟大友谊
    为苏联“真理报”作
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理　李先念
    1950年2月14日，中苏两国政府签订的友好同盟互助条约是中苏两国八亿人民伟大友谊的历史标志。七年来，中苏两国友好合作关系的不断巩固和发展，对于促进两国建设事业的发展，对于维护亚洲和世界的和平，以及对于促进人类进步事业都起了重大的作用。毫无疑问，在今后两国人民的生活和实践中，这种合作关系的内容还会更加丰富，它的作用也会更加重要。因此，在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订七周年的今天，中国人民同苏联人民以及全世界所有爱好和平的人民一样，怀着十分满意和愉快的心情，热烈庆祝这一伟大节日，并为中苏两国的共同繁荣而欢欣鼓舞。
    在庆祝这个节日的时候，我们愉快地看到，伟大的苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，在宏伟的共产主义建设事业中获得了许多新的成就。苏联人民在1955年胜利完成了第五个发展国民经济的五年计划之后，1956年又以无比的劳动热情超额完成了第六个五年计划的第一个年度计划。1956年工业生产总值比1955年增加了约11％。农业生产获得了空前的大丰收，谷物总收获量比1955年增加了约20％，而且许多先进集体农庄和国营农场的生产已经达到了第六个五年计划结束时应达到的指标。在科学技术和文化教育等各个方面，也都有了新的发展。随着生产的发展，苏联人民的物质和文化生活也更加丰富多采了。这些成就大大地加强了苏联和整个社会主义阵营的力量，同时雄辩地显示了社会主义制度的优越性。中国人民在欢呼苏联人民所取得的成就的同时，衷心地预祝苏联人民在共产主义建设事业中继续获得更大的成就。
    中国人民在中国共产党和中国人民政府的领导下，在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中也取得了重大的成绩。我国农业和手工业的合作化已经基本完成，资本主义的工商业也已经实现了全行业的公私合营，人民群众的社会主义积极性有了空前的高涨。1956年工业生产总值较1955年增长了25％左右，农业虽遭受严重灾害，但产量仍有增加。这些成绩使我们有可能超额完成第一个五年计划，并为第二个五年计划打下良好的基础。我们相信，只要我们团结一致、努力工作、虚心学习，并且保持勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的作风，我们就有可能在三个五年计划时期或者更长一些的时期内把中国建成为一个社会主义工业国家。
    中国人民这些成就的取得是同苏联人民的支持和援助分不开的。中国人民不但从苏联的革命经验中，而且也从苏联建设社会主义的经验中学到许多宝贵的东西。特别是在我国社会主义建设事业中，苏联人民和苏联政府给予了我们多方面的、兄弟般的巨大援助。几年以来，根据中苏友好同盟互助条约和其他有关协定，苏联通过优惠贷款、发展贸易、供应成套设备和技术资料、派遣专家和科学技术文化合作等方式，帮助我国恢复了国民经济，发展了社会主义建设。1956年4月，苏联政府继帮助我国建设一百五十六个项目之后，又决定帮助我国增建五十五个新的工业企业。这些工业企业是我国社会主义建设的中心，它们全部建成，将大大改变我国长期落后的面貌。在科学技术合作上，根据中苏科学技术合作协定，我们两国在这方面的合作一年比一年加强，合作项目也一年比一年增多。中苏两国互相派遣了大批的考察专家、实习生、留学生。特别是在1956年当我国提出向科学进军的任务后，苏联为了帮助我国发展科学事业，曾派遣了优秀的苏联专家来帮助我国制订关于发展科学研究的远景规划，此外还帮助我国发展和平利用原子能的研究工作。通过苏联的这些帮助，将使我国有可能在较短的时期内摆脱科学技术上的落后状态，而达到世界先进科学技术的水平。在文化合作方面，1956年根据两国文化合作关系日益发展的情况，中苏两国签订了第一个文化合作协定，最近又制订了1957年的文化合作执行计划，进一步加强了我们两国间文化合作的计划性。中国人民十分感激苏联人民的、兄弟般的无私援助，并将继续加强对苏联建设的先进经验的研究和学习。中国人民将永远同苏联人民一起努力发展我们相互间的友好合作，以促进我们两国建设事业的共同高涨。
    特别应该指出，最近以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团应苏联政府的邀请，到苏联进行了友好访问和会谈，中国人民和苏联人民一样，极为重视这次会谈的结果。不久苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志即将来我国访问。我们深信，两国领导人员的相互访问和会谈，必将对进一步发展和加强两国的友好合作关系创造新的条件，从而对促进两国建设事业和世界和平作出新的贡献。
    由于中苏两国人民以及社会主义各国人民的团结合作和相互支持，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营得到不断的巩固和壮大，并已成为世界和平和人类进步事业最有力的支柱。正因为如此，帝国主义侵略势力一直企图用各种方法颠覆社会主义国家，破坏社会主义国家之间的团结。中国人民根据自己的切身经验深知，只要依靠广大人民群众的团结一致，对敌人的阴谋进行彻底的揭露和坚决的斗争，任何敌人的猖狂进攻都是可以击败的。
    在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订七周年的时候，我们特别高兴地看到以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的团结有了新的发展。社会主义国家有着共同的思想基础和建设共产主义的共同目标，它们之间的关系是建立在马克思列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义和各民族完全平等的原则上的。苏联政府1956年10月30日发表的“关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言”，充分体现了这些原则。最近以来，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家先后进行了一系列的同志式的双边或多边会谈，调整和加强了相互间的友好合作关系，进一步加强了以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结，并为击退敌人反社会主义、反和平、反人民的猖狂进攻作出了新的巨大贡献。在这方面，中苏两国八亿人民的亲密团结是社会主义各国团结的重要部分。中国人民将永远同苏联和其他社会主义国家人民一起，为加强社会主义阵营的团结而共同努力。
    在国际上，中苏两国坚持不渝地奉行着和平的外交政策，并且同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，一直为维护和平、为和缓国际紧张局势进行着巨大的努力。我们坚持根据和平共处五项原则继续发展各国间的关系，坚持以和平协商的办法解决一切国际争端，坚持以集体安全体系来代替侵略性军事集团，坚决反对殖民主义的侵略行为，坚决主张裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器。由于我们两国和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的努力，国际局势一再得到缓和。可是帝国主义侵略势力总是不甘心于这种缓和的。每当国际局势有所和缓的时候，他们就拼命加紧冷战，进行侵略扩张。但是过去的事实证明，只要我们提高警惕，坚决斗争，国际反动势力的任何阴谋活动都是可以挫败的，历史的车轮是不会后退的。中国人民将继续和苏联人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民一道，为世界的持久和平进行不懈的斗争。
    中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
