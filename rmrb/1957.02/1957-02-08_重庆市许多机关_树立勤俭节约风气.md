Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th. Many agencies in Chongqing Municipality have begun to establish a new style of frugality and thrift. In the past, the Housing Allocation Section of the Chongqing Municipal Real Estate Management Bureau was busy all day solving housing problems for various units. The two telephones in the section rang constantly, and people sent by various units to ask for houses lined up in a long snake-like queue at the door every day. The seven or eight cadres in the section felt overwhelmed. Since December of last year, this situation has changed. Many units, based on the principle of saving housing and improving the utilization rate of houses, have rationally adjusted their housing. The Municipal Insurance Company's office in the Nan'an District had surplus dormitories in the central urban area, while the Construction Bank in the central urban area had large dormitories in the Nan'an District. Originally, both units felt that the dormitories near the office were insufficient. After negotiated exchanges, the Municipal Insurance Company's Nan'an office saved the entire expense of 18,000 yuan that it had originally planned to spend on building dormitories. In late January, the Municipal People's Committee also vacated three guest houses and handed them over to the Municipal Service Industry Company for management. These houses can accommodate 800 tourists, solving some of the company's housing shortage.

How can we do more with less money? Many agencies have recently found many tricks. The Municipal Public Security Bureau mobilized agency cadres to carefully calculate the details and save unnecessary expenses, and has already cut this year's budget by more than 300,000 yuan. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has also preliminarily drawn up a plan to save 120,000 yuan in administrative expenses throughout the year. They changed the paper used for internal publications from good paper to second-class paper, which can save more than 60,000 yuan. The consumption of gasoline in the city's agencies has also been significantly reduced. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China used 1,390 kilograms of gasoline in twenty days in January last year, but only 356 kilograms in the same period this year. In order to save expenses, the staff of the Pharmacy Department of the First People's Hospital decided to produce the distilled water they needed themselves. The first batch of 800 bottles has already been produced. In this way, this department can save more than 30,000 yuan for the entire hospital this year.

    重庆市许多机关
    树立勤俭节约风气
    新华社重庆7日电　重庆市许多机关开始树立起勤俭节约的新风气。重庆市房地产管理局房屋调配科过去整天忙于解决各单位用房的问题，科里两部电话整天响个不停，各单位派来这里要房子的人，每天都在门口排成一条长蛇阵，科里七、八个干部感到应接不暇。去年12月份以来，这种情况改变了，不少单位本着节约用房和提高房屋使用率的原则，合理地调整了用房。在南岸区的市保险公司办事处，在市中心区有多余宿舍，在市中心区的建设银行又在南岸区有大幢宿舍。原来这两个单位都感到机关附近的宿舍不够。经过协商调换后，市保险公司南岸办事处原来准备花一万八千元修建宿舍的费用就全部节省下来了。市人民委员会1月下旬也腾出了三个招待所，交给市服务业公司管理。这些房舍可以容纳八百名旅客，解决了这个公司房舍缺少的部分困难。
    怎样才能少花钱、多办事？许多机关最近找出了不少窍门。市公安局动员机关干部切实算细账节省不必要的开支，已经把今年的预算削减了三十多万元。中共重庆市委员会机关也初步订出了全年节约十二万元行政费用的计划。他们把内部刊物用纸由好纸全部改为次纸，可以节约六万多元。全市机关汽油的消耗量也已经显著减少。中共重庆市委员会去年1月份的二十天内用了一千三百九十公斤汽油，今年同期只用了三百五十六公斤。第一人民医院药剂科的职工为了节省开支，决定自己生产需用的蒸馏水，第一批八百瓶已经生产出来。这样，这个科今年就可以为全医院节约三万多元。
