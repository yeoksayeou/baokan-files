    Xinhuanet, Xining, 7th February – The workers of Datong People's Coal Mine in Qinghai Province, who overfulfilled the state plan by 25% last year, plan to increase coal production by another 12.8% this year on the basis of last year.

    The mine's production has developed rapidly in recent years. In the early days of liberation, the entire mine only had five small shafts and one adit, with a daily output of less than 100 tons. Now the daily output has reached more than 1,100 tons. A slope shaft that the mine began constructing in January of last year has been basically completed and is expected to be put into production in April. After the Qiaotou Power Plant, which is specifically for supplying electricity to the coal mine, begins to transmit power in the second quarter, the mine's coal mining and transportation operations will gradually adopt machinery such as electric drills, pneumatic picks, and chain conveyors. This will greatly reduce the physical labor of the workers.

    In order to further develop this mining area, the 132 Team of the Northwest Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry is conducting general and detailed exploration drilling here. According to the person in charge of Team 132, preliminary materials from the general survey and exploration show that this large intermountain basin is a mining area with very rich coal resources.

    Datong People's Coal Mine is located relatively close to Xining City, and most of the coal used by factories, mines, agricultural areas, and government agencies and residents in Qinghai Province is supplied by this mine.

### 大通煤矿加紧生产和建设

    大通煤矿加紧生产和建设
    新华社西宁7日电　去年超额25％完成国家计划的青海省大通人民煤矿职工，今年计划在原有的基础上比去年再增产12.8％的煤炭。
    这个煤矿几年来生产发展很快。解放初期，全矿只有五对很小的矿井和一个平洞，日产量还不到一百吨。现在日产量已经达到一千一百多吨。这个矿去年1月开始建设的一口斜井已经基本建成，预计4月份就可以投入生产。专为供应煤矿用电的桥头电厂第二季度开始送电以后，这个煤矿的掘煤、运煤等工作，就将逐步采用电钻、风镐、链板运输机等机械。这样就可以大大减轻工人的体力劳动。
    为了进一步建设这个矿区，煤炭工业部西北管理局一三二队正在这里进行普查和详查钻探工作。据一三二队负责人说，从普查勘探的初步材料来看，这个面积很大的山间盆地，是一个煤矿资源很丰富的矿区。
    大通人民煤矿距西宁市较近，青海省各厂矿、农业区和机关、居民的用煤，大部分靠这里供应。
