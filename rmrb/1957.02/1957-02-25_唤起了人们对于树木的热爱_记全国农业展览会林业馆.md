    Aroused People's Love for Trees
    ——A Record of the Forestry Pavilion at the National Agricultural Exhibition
    Our reporter Chen Bowei
    The Green Treasure
    Having visited the Meteorology Pavilion and bid farewell to "wind, rain, thunder, and lightning," we took a few steps and entered another beautiful and quiet world – the world of trees. More than fifty kinds of timber forests, protection forests, economic forests, and other precious trees, from Heilongjiang in the north to Hainan Island in the south, all converged here. Wandering in this green palace, we were completely surrounded by the vibrant, verdant color. Yes, everything here seemed to be green. Not to mention the long rows of lush pine and cypress trees, the glossy-leaved rubber trees and eucommia trees, the fir trees that grow abundantly in the south, and many, many other trees. Even the colorful and dazzling wood industrial products and forestry by-products on the two tall platforms in the center of the hall seemed to give people a green feeling, because they were all products of trees or products from the forest.

    This is the Forestry Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition.

    This pavilion attracts crowds of visitors with its richness and beauty; it tells you about all kinds of interesting knowledge about trees, and it arouses your love for trees.

    Which day do we not see trees? What's so special about them? However, if you carefully visit this Forestry Pavilion, you will exclaim: How precious are trees! At the same time, you will also sigh: Although we see trees hundreds of times every day, how little we knew about trees in the past!

    Building houses, constructing railways, erecting bridges and power lines, manufacturing vehicles and ships, making furniture, and making paper and matches, etc., none of these can be done without wood, which everyone knows. However, how great is the usefulness of wood in these aspects? This is not very clear to everyone. Regarding these, the narrators of the Forestry Pavilion will point to charts to tell you some important figures:

    Building a mixed-structure factory building with an area of 1,000 square meters requires 130 cubic meters of wood. During the Five-Year Plan period, thousands of factories of all sizes will be built, which requires a lot of wood! In the past two or three years, the wood allocated by the state for general construction accounted for 69.17% of the total wood production.

    Constructing one kilometer of railway requires 1,800 sleepers, equivalent to about 300 cubic meters of wood. The construction of the 697-kilometer Yingtan-Xiamen Railway alone required 209,100 cubic meters of wood. The wood used by the state for railway sleepers accounts for 10.61% of the total wood production. By the time of the Third Five-Year Plan, the amount of wood needed for railways will double.

    Mining 100 tons of coal requires about 25 cubic meters of mine props; in 1957, 100 million tons of raw coal will be mined, requiring 25 million cubic meters of wood. The wood allocated by the state for mine props accounts for 13.22% of wood production. During the Third Five-Year Plan, the amount of wood needed for coal mines will triple.

    Producing one ton of paper requires 2.9 cubic meters (using mechanical grinding method) or 6 cubic meters (using chemical method). At present, the wood supplied for papermaking raw materials accounts for 2.43% of the total wood production. During the Third Five-Year Plan, the amount of wood needed for the paper industry will increase tenfold.

    These are just a few major uses of wood. These alone show how important wood is in the country's industrial and transportation construction.

    Speaking of the use of forests in construction, we cannot ignore a promising tree species, which is bamboo. In the Forestry Pavilion, we saw photos of the bamboo-reinforced concrete structure of the No. 7 Middle School in Guangzhou. It was built in 1918 and still serves people well. Also on display here is a model of the building of the nursery of Tongji University in Shanghai. In addition to brick walls and tile roofs, this building is mainly composed of bamboo-reinforced concrete and bamboo-structured frame. Bamboo's compressive and tensile strength is more than three times stronger than that of fir. Bamboo grows faster than any tree: it grows more than ten feet tall in a year and can become timber in four or five years. In the future, bamboo can be used to replace some wood and steel to build houses. Of course, bamboo has more uses than just this.

    However, if you only know this, you are far from uncovering the secrets of trees. The large number of wood industrial products displayed in the Forestry Pavilion will open our eyes from another aspect. Here, the narrators first tell us that wood dry distillation alone has so many tricks: the gas after wood dry distillation can be used as fuel; the liquid can be refined into wood alcohol, acetic acid, wood tar, and turpentine; and acetic acid is the raw material for rayon, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and film; wood tar can be used as an antioxidant for synthetic gasoline, a softener for rubber, a wood preservative, a plastic for electrical insulation, and so on.

    Here, we also saw products such as glucose, xylose, and furfural made by hydrolyzing wood. What particularly aroused the interest of the audience was the explanation that making alcohol from wood can save a lot of grain: 10,000 kilograms of sawdust can replace 3,000 kilograms of grain to produce 1,000 kilograms of alcohol, and its cost is only equivalent to 5% of the alcohol made from grain!

    We have seen the scene where customers enthusiastically snapped up expensive imported synthetic fiber products in the market, but many beautiful synthetic fiber fabrics are made of wood and other inexpensive materials. On the physical display table of wood industrial products in the Forestry Pavilion, we saw dazzling silks and fabrics made of rayon and synthetic wool, which are not only beautiful but also durable. Here, the narrator did the math: 320 catties of rayon can be extracted from one cubic meter of wood, which is equivalent to the cotton produced by 7.5 mu of cotton fields in a year, or the silk spun by 380,000 silkworms, or the wool sheared from 30 sheep. The cost of rayon is only one-tenth of the price of natural silk.

    Walking to the glossy compressed wood, we couldn't help but want to touch this wooden product that is almost as hard and heavy as steel. It is made by pressing and heating ordinary wood and can be used to replace steel in many aspects of industry. It is said that the conduits of the lock of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal in the Soviet Union are made of plywood tubes made of compressed wood. Unfortunately, what is displayed here is plywood tubes imported from the Soviet Union, and our country has not yet manufactured them.

    People often discard or burn a large amount of sawdust as waste. However, the narrator is telling us that sawdust is also a treasure. It can not only be used to refine alcohol and other products, but also to make bakelite products, such as telecommunications tools, film machinery, measuring instruments, and so on. It is said that there are about 20,000 kinds of bakelite products in the world.

    Forestry by-products are also part of the forest treasure trove. As long as you walk around the circular platform of by-products, you will see many large bottles filled with rosin, tea oil, tung oil, camphor, eucommia gum, gallnut, etc., and see mottled tiger skins, precious sable furs, otter furs, and other furs, as well as medicinal materials such as ginseng. We know that these world-renowned treasures have been praised by many people in the international market. In this regard, shouldn't we also thank the gifts of the forest?

    A Solid Barrier to Fighting Nature
    The Forestry Pavilion tells us with concrete images and eloquent facts how important a role forests play in the great struggle of mankind to transform nature. In the western part of Northeast China, parts of Inner Mongolia, northern Shaanxi, and other regions, the harm caused by wind and sand is well known. We often hear that how many houses and fertile fields have been swallowed by shifting sand, and how many villages have been chased by wind and sand and moved year after year. However, once a protection forest is built, the wind and sand are subdued by people. And this is not a very distant thing that is out of reach. In the Forestry Pavilion, we can see such pictures: the Bajiazi Township of Fuyu County, Jilin Province, which was harmed by wind and sand, built a farmland protection forest network five years ago, and now the trees have grown to two feet tall. Lush and lovely millet grows in the forest network. In the sixteen counties of Minquan and Lankao in eastern Henan Province, there are 4.2 million mu of sandy wasteland. Every winter and spring, wind and sand destroy crops and bury villages like floods. After liberation, the Party and the government led the people to build 527,000 mu of protection forests. In addition to protecting 4 million mu of farmland, they also expanded the cultivated land by 250,000 mu. Such examples can be found in the Yulin area of northern Shaanxi, the western area of Hebei Province, and some other areas. All of these remind us that if we want to reduce and eliminate wind, sand, water, and drought disasters, so as to change the natural appearance of the motherland, we must regard the forest as a solid barrier on this front.

    For thousands of years, the Chinese people, who have suffered from water and drought disasters, have longed for good weather and dreamed of the day when the Yellow River will become clear. In order to overcome water and drought disasters, we must not only build many water conservancy projects, but also seek protection from forests. The Forestry Pavilion uses an electric chart and many models and photos to illustrate the fact that forests can maintain soil and water. The following is the history of the vicissitudes of Yushe County, Shanxi Province: In the years of reactionary rule in the past, the forests along Heshun Mountain and the Zhuozhang River in the county were completely destroyed, and soil erosion was very serious. Mountain floods washed away 150,000 mu of farmland out of the county's only 250,000 mu, and people were separated from their wives and children and fled everywhere. In the seven years after liberation, the county planted 42,000 mu of trees and built a bank protection forest belt 120 miles long along the Zhuozhang River. Now, the water in the upper reaches of the Zhuozhang River, 40 miles away, has become clear, and 55,000 mu of fertile farmland has been restored in the places that were flooded in the past. The yield per mu has increased from 80 jin to 200 jin. The forest also provides a large amount of timber and firewood, and the grassland protected by the forest belt has become a good pasture. The Forestry Pavilion also introduced the Yuanyao River Basin in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, and the Shiru Township in Huaiji County, Guangdong Province... These places have significant achievements and rich experience in afforestation and soil and water conservation.

    Struggling for the Greening of the Land
    However, in daily work and life, people often ignore the value of forests. Some people mistakenly believe that my country has boundless forests and will never be exhausted. In fact, this is an illusion. The fact is that my country's forest resources are not too many, but too few! As soon as you enter the hall of the Forestry Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition, you will see an electric chart showing the distribution of forests in my country. It points out to us that there are more than 5,000 kinds of cold, temperate, and tropical trees growing on my country's vast land. My country is one of the countries with the most kinds of trees in the world. However, the forest area only accounts for 7.9% of the total land area. Compared with other countries, the situation is as follows: the forest area of the Soviet Union accounts for 33.9% of the total land area, the United States is 32.8%, and Japan is 61.8%. Calculated by population, the Soviet Union has 3.5 hectares of forest per person, the United States has 1.8 hectares, and Japan has 0.3 hectares; while my country has only 0.13 hectares per person. Knowing this, it is not surprising that we often feel that the supply of wood cannot meet the demand in industrial construction and daily life.

    In the past few years after liberation, my country's forestry construction has been developing rapidly. From 1949 to the first half of 1956, a total of 10,340,000 hectares of afforestation were carried out across the country (Note: The afforestation figures recorded in the article "One Year and Ten Thousand Years" published on the third page of this newspaper on February 22 were incorrect and should be based on this). This is equal to 18.6 times the total area of afforestation in the 22 years of Kuomintang rule. This includes the large-scale protection forest belts built in the western part of Northeast China, the western part of Hebei, the eastern part of Henan, and other places using the state-owned afforestation method; many of the trees in these forest belts have become forests and are playing a role in preventing wind and sand. In addition to this, judging from the greening achievements of individual regions shown in the exhibition, there are also many excellent examples of greening the countryside and changing the natural appearance of their hometowns, which are also worthy of our admiration. In this regard, there are Yangjingdi Township (Pingshun County, Shanxi Province) and Jianpu Township (Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province), which implement diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry on the basis of comprehensive planning and develop production, and the Xiling Township Agricultural Cooperative (Yanggao County, Shanxi Province), which is headed by forestry models Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai to transform Daquanshan, and Yifeng Village (Lankao County, Henan Province), which has transformed the "sand country" (the sandy wasteland formed after the breach of the Yellow River in the Qing Dynasty) into a new village with abundant agricultural products, as well as other regions. All these achievements cannot but play a huge role in promoting and encouraging our greening movement.

    However, compared with the large area of bare mountains and wastelands in our country, the green area that we have expanded on the land of our motherland in the past few years is only a few small green spots, and our task is to green all the barren hills and wastelands that can be greened within the twelve years starting from 1956. This is the glorious and magnificent task of our generation. Everyone who visits the Forestry Pavilion will eventually stand in front of a large picture depicting the beautiful scenery of the greened mountains and linger. At this time, we cannot help but ask ourselves with deep feelings for trees: In order to add more trees to your hometown, in order to add more green to the land of the motherland, what do you plan to do...

    唤起了人们对于树木的热爱
    ——记全国农业展览会林业馆
    本报记者　陈泊微
    绿色的宝库
    参观过气象馆，同“风雨雷电”告别以后，我们迈过几步就跨进了另一个美丽而安静的世界——树木的世界。北起黑龙江南到海南岛所有的用材林、防护林、经济林的树和其他名贵的树五十多种，都在这里会师了。漫游在这座绿色的宫殿里，我们完全为那青春焕发的葱绿的颜色所包围了。是的，这里的，一切似乎都是绿色的，那长长的一行行的茂盛的松树和柏树、叶子光润的橡胶树和杜仲树，南方大量生长的杉树，以及许多许多别的树，都不用说了，就是矗立在大厅中央的那两座高大的台子上的五光十色、琳琅满目的木材工业品和林业副产品，仿佛也给人以绿色的感觉，因为它们都是树木的产物或林中的产品。
    这就是全国农业展览会的林业馆。
    这个馆以它的丰富和美丽吸引着参观的人群；它告诉你关于树木的种种有趣的知识，它唤起你对于树木的热爱。
    我们哪一天还看不见树木？它有什么稀奇呢？但是，如果细心地参观过这个林业馆以后，你就会发出赞叹：多么宝贵的树木呵！同时你也会发出感慨：尽管我们每天几百遍地看见树木，可是，关于树木的知识，我们过去知道得多么少呵！
    建筑房屋，修筑铁路，架设桥梁和电线，制造车辆和船舶，制造家具，以及造纸造火柴，等等，没有一样能离开木材，这是谁都知道的。但是，木材在这方面的功用究竟有多么大？这却不是人人都十分清楚的了。关于这些，林业馆的讲解员会指着图表告诉你一些重要的数字：
    建筑一座一千平方公尺面积的混合结构的厂房需要一百三十立方公尺木材。在五年计划期间要建筑几千座大大小小的工厂，这需要多少木材呵！近两三年来，国家拨作一般建筑用的木材，占木材总产量的69.17％。
    修筑一公里铁路就需要一千八百根枕木，约合三百立方公尺木材。单是修筑六百九十七公里的鹰厦铁路，就需要二十万九千一百立方公尺木材。国家用作铁路枕木的木材占木材总生产量的10.61％。到第三个五年计划的时候，铁路需要的木材量将增加二倍。
    采一百吨煤就需要矿柱约合二十五立方公尺木材；1957年将开采原煤一万万吨，需要木材二千五百万立方公尺。国家拨作矿柱用的木材占木材生产量的13.22％。第三个五年期间，煤矿需要的木材量将增加三倍。
    生产一吨纸张需要二点九立方公尺（用机械磨碎法），或六立方公尺（用化学方法）现在供应造纸原料的木材，占木材总产量的2.43％。第三个五年计划期间，造纸工业需要的木材量将增加十倍。
    这只不过是木材的几项大宗的用途。仅仅这些，就已可以看出木材在国家工业和交通建设中占着怎样重要的地位了。
    谈到林木在建设中的用途，我们不可忽视一个大有前途的树种，这就是竹子。我们在林业馆里看到广州市第七中学的竹筋混凝土结构的楼房照片，它是1918年建成的，现在仍然很好地为人们服务。这里陈列的还有上海同济大学托儿所的楼房模型，这所楼房除了砖墙和瓦顶外，主要是竹筋混凝土和竹结构的房架构成的。竹子的抗压力和抗拉力，都比杉木强三倍多。竹子比任何树生长得都快：一年长一丈多高，四、五年就可成材。今后可以用竹材代替一部分木材和钢材，建筑房屋。当然，竹子的用途并不止这一项。
    但是，如果你仅仅了解到这些，你还是远没有揭开树木的秘密。林业馆中陈列着的大量木材工业品会从另一个方面打开我们的眼界。在这里，讲解员首先告诉我们，光是一项木材干馏就有这末多的名堂：木材干馏后的气体可以做燃料；液体可以提炼出木精、醋酸、木焦油和松节油；而醋酸则是人造丝、药剂、塑料和电影胶片的原料；木焦油可以做人造汽油的防氧化剂、橡胶的软化剂、木材防腐剂、电气绝缘的塑胶，等等。
    在这里，我们还看到把木材经过水分解制成的葡萄糖、木糖、糖醛等产品。特别引起观众的兴趣的是：用木材制酒精可以大量节约粮食的说明：一万公斤锯末可以代替三千公斤粮食，制出一千公斤的酒精，它的成本只不过相当于用粮食造出的酒精的5％！
    我们曾经在市场上看到从外国进口的价格昂贵的人造纤维品被顾客们踊跃争购的情形，但是，很多漂亮的人造纤维织品却不过是用木材和其他廉价的东西制成的。在林业馆的木材工业品的实物台上我们就看见一幅幅灿烂夺目的人造丝和人造羊毛制成的绸缎和衣料，它们不仅美观，而且耐用。这里说明员算了一笔账：从一立方公尺木材中可以提炼出三百二十斤人造丝，相当于七亩半棉田一年产的棉花，或三十八万只蚕吐的丝，或三十头绵羊身上剪下来的羊毛。人造丝的成本只相当于天然丝价格的十分之一。
    走到富有光泽的压缩木的前面，我们禁不住想摸一摸这种几乎像钢铁一样坚硬、沉重的木材制品。它是把普通木材加压、加热制成的，可以在工业的好些方面代替钢铁使用。据说，苏联列宁伏尔加顿河运河水闸的导管，就是用的压缩木制成的层板木管。可惜这里陈列的是从苏联进口的层板木管，我国目前还没有制造。
    人们常常把大量锯末当作废物抛弃或者烧掉。但是，说明员在告诉我们，锯末也是宝贝，用它不仅可以提炼酒精等产品，而且可以制成电木制品，如电讯工具、电影机械、测量仪器等等。据说，光是电木制品，世界上就约有二万种。
    林业副产品也是森林宝库的一部分。只要环绕着副产品的圆台走一周，你就会看到许多装着松脂、茶油、桐油、樟脑、杜仲胶、五棓子等的大瓶子，看到斑烂多纹的虎皮、名贵的紫貂皮、水獭皮以及其他毛皮，还有人参等药材。我们知道，这些驰名世界的珍贵的东西，在国际市场上曾经受到了多少人的称赞。在这方面，难道我们不也应当感谢森林的赐予吗？
    向自然作斗争的坚固屏障
    林业馆以具体的形象和雄辩的事实告诉我们，森林在人类改造自然的伟大斗争中，起着多么重大的作用。在我国东北地区的西部、内蒙古的部分地区、陕北等地区，风沙为害之惨，是尽人皆知的。我们常听说，有多少房屋和良田被流沙吞没了，有多少村庄被风沙追赶着逐年移动。但是，一旦造起防护林的时候，风沙就被人们制服了。而且这并不是十分遥远的可望而不可即的事情。在林业馆里，我们可以看到这样一些图片：风沙为害的吉林省扶余县八家子乡五年前营造起护田林网，现在树木已长到两丈来高。林网里长起了繁盛可爱的谷子。河南省东部民权、兰考等十六个县有四百二十万亩沙荒，每当冬春季节，风沙像洪水一样摧毁庄稼，掩没村庄。解放后，党和政府领导人民营造防护林五十二万七千亩，除了使四百万亩农田得到保护外，还扩大耕地二十五万亩。像这样的事例，在陕北榆林地区、河北省西部地区和其他一些地区，都可以找到。
    几千年来饱受水旱灾害之苦的我国人民，渴望着风调雨顺的好气候，梦想着黄河变清的一天早日到来。为了战胜水旱灾害，我们不但要建设许多水利工程，而且必须向森林求庇护。林业馆用一幅电动图表和许多模型、照片来说明森林可以保持水土的事实。下面就是山西省榆社县的沧桑更嬗的历史：在过去反动统治的年代，这个县境内的和顺山和浊漳河沿岸的森林完全被破坏，水土流失很严重，山洪把全县仅有的二十五万亩中的十五万亩农田冲去了，人民妻离子散，四处逃荒。解放后的七年来，全县造了四万二千亩林木，在浊漳河两岸造起了长达一百二十里的护岸林带。现在，浊漳河上游四十里的河水变清了，在过去被水淹过的地方，恢复起了五万五千亩良田，每亩产量从八十斤提高到二百斤。森林还提供了大量的木材和烧柴，在林带庇护下的草地，成了良好的牧场。林业馆还介绍了山西省翼城县的元窑河流域、广东省怀集县仕儒乡……这些地方都有造林保持水土的显著成绩和丰富经验。这些都在提醒我们，要想减轻和消除风沙水旱灾害，从而改变祖国的自然面貌，必须把森林作为这条战线上的坚固的屏障。
    为国土的绿化而斗争
    但是，在日常工作和生活中，人们往往忽视了森林的可贵。有些人误认为我国树海无边无际，永远取用不竭。其实这是一种错觉。事实是，我国的森林资源不是太多，而是太少了！一走进全国农业展览会的林业馆的大厅，你就会看见一幅表明我国森林分布的电动图表，它向我们指出，在我国辽阔的土地上生长有寒、温、热带的树木种类在五千种以上，我国是世界上树木种类最多的国家之一。但是，森林面积只占国土总面积的7.9％。同别的国家相比，情形是这样：苏联的森林面积占国土总面积的33.9％，美国是32.8％，日本是61.8％。如果按人口平均计算，苏联每人有森林三点五公顷，美国是一点八公顷，日本是零点三公顷；而我国每人仅有零点一三公顷。了解到这一点，对于目前，我们在工业建设和日常生活中常感到木材供不应求，就丝毫不会觉得奇怪了。
    解放后几年来，我国的林业建设正在飞跃地发展。从1949年到1956年上半年，全国共造林一千零三十四万公顷（按：本报2月22日第三版所载“一年和万年”一文中所记造林数字有误，应以此为准），等于国民党统治时代二十二年造林总面积的十八点六倍。其中包括利用国营造林的方式，在东北西部、河北西部、河南东部等地营造的大规模的防护林带；这些林带的树木许多都已成林，正在起着防御风沙的作用。除这以外，再从展览会所展示的个别地区的绿化成绩看，也有许多绿化乡土、改变了家乡的自然面貌的优秀榜样，也值得我们钦敬。在这方面，有实行在全面规划的基础上实行农林牧多种经营的、发展生产的羊井底乡（山西省平顺县）和简朴乡（广东省潮阳县），有以林业模范张枫林、高进才为首改造大泉山的西岭乡农业社（山西省阳高县），有把“沙土国”（清朝黄河决口后形成的沙荒地区）改造成为农产丰富的新村的仪封村（河南省兰考县），以及另外一些地区。所有这些成就，不能不在我们的绿化运动中发挥巨大的推动和鼓舞作用。
    可是，过去几年中我们在祖国的国土上扩大的一些绿色的面积，同我国的大量秃山和荒地面积比较起来，那还只不过一块块绿色小斑点，而我们的任务，却是在从1956年开始的十二年内绿化一切可能绿化的荒山荒地。这是我们这一代人的光荣而宏伟的任务。每个人在参观林业馆的最后都要站在一大幅描绘绿化后的山区的美丽景色的图画面前，流连忘返。这时候，我们不禁怀着对于树木的深厚的感情，向自己发出这样的问题：为了给自己的乡土增加更多的树木，为了给祖国的国土增加更多的绿色，你打算作些什么呢……
