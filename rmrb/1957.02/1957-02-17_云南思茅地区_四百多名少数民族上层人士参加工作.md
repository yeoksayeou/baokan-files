    Over Four Hundred Ethnic Minority Upper-Class Figures Participate in Work

    (By our correspondent) By the end of 1956, over four hundred ethnic minority upper-class figures in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Lancang Lahu Autonomous County, Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County, and Menglian Dai, Lahu, and Va Autonomous County in Simao Region, Yunnan, had participated in work. Among them, some are deputies to the National People's Congress or representatives to the Provincial, Autonomous Prefecture, and County People's Congresses (Representative Conferences), or members of the Provincial, Autonomous Prefecture, and County People's Committees; some are members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference or local committees of the Provincial, Autonomous Prefecture, and County CPPCC; and some hold leading positions in autonomous organs, becoming staff members of state organs.

    The Party and the government also take good care of their lives. After peaceful consultations were used to carry out land reform in the border areas, ethnic minority upper-class figures gave up exploitation. Based on their previous living standards, the state allocated 97,000 yuan to provide them with living subsidies, so that their living standards would not be reduced. (Peng Bin)

    云南思茅地区
    四百多名少数民族上层人士参加工作
    本报讯　云南思茅地区西双版纳傣族自治州、澜沧拉祜族自治县、江城哈尼族彝族自治县和孟连傣族拉祜族佧佤族自治县的少数民族上层人士，到1956年年底，已经有四百多人参加了工作。其中有的是全国人民代表大会代表或省、州、县人民代表大会（代表会议）代表，或省、州、县人民委员会委员；有的是中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会或省、州、县政协地方委员会委员；有的在自治机关内担任领导职务，成为国家机关的工作人员。
    党和政府对他们的生活也很照顾，在边疆地区用和平协商办法进行土地改革以后，少数民族上层人士放弃了剥削。根据他们以往的生活水平，国家拨出了九万七千元，分别给他们作为生活补贴，使他们的生活水平不致降低。（彭彬）
