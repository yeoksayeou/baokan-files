    Thank you for your support, our fellow coal mine worker brothers:
    We are deeply moved by your action of voluntarily contributing two days of your Spring Festival holiday to alleviate the tension in the nation's first quarter industrial production and civilian coal supply. We know that in socialist construction, you – our dear coal mine worker brothers – have been working diligently. During this grand festival, you have sacrificed the opportunity to reunite with your families, visit relatives and friends, watch theater performances and enjoy yourselves, completing the urgent and glorious task assigned to you by the state. What an admirable spirit of selflessness! Your actions fully embody the fine tradition of hard work and diligence of our working class and the noble quality of "everything for socialism." For this, we steelworkers extend our cordial greetings and high respect to you.
    Coal is our food. Without it, we cannot produce. Your hard work is your support for us. When we see the golden molten iron flowing continuously from the furnace, we will think of the results of your selfless labor contained within it, and deeply thank you. When we celebrate the Spring Festival, we raise our glasses high and wish you good health.
    To produce more and better steel for the country, we are working day and night in earnest. During the Spring Festival, the vast majority of our comrades still adhered to their posts. In the future, we will work harder to increase production. Comrades! Let us join hands on different production fronts to advance towards the victorious completion of the national plan!
    The entire staff of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

    Learning from You, Dear Coal Mine Worker Comrades:
    With gratitude and respect, we extend our heartfelt and high respect to you – all the coal mine workers who contributed two days of your holiday to alleviate the coal supply tension.
    Comrades! During the Spring Festival, when we hear the hissing sound of the radiator in the room, when we add coal in the kitchen, when we see the smoke rising from the boiler chimney, when we hear the rumble of the train, when we see the bright electric lights, we think that these precious light and heat are inseparable from your hard work. As the People's Daily editorial pointed out: "Those who sacrifice their own happiness for the happiness of others are always the model of the people, and always worthy of people's gratitude and respect!"
    Comrades! Your spirit of consciously overcoming difficulties for the country and courageously sacrificing yourselves is worth learning from. We must learn from your fine tradition of hard work and diligence, and we must support you with actions such as saving coal, water, and electricity.

    Inspired and Educated Us, Dear Coal Mine Worker Comrades:
    You gave up the happy life of returning home for a family reunion during the Spring Festival, some even postponed their wedding dates, sacrificing your holidays to increase coal production for the country. This high degree of labor enthusiasm has inspired us and educated us!
    In addition to expressing our condolences to you, we also assure you that on the road to advancing military science, we will overcome all difficulties, study diligently, so as to skillfully wield the weapons in our hands and master the technology to defend our great motherland. May we, in different positions, jointly contribute all our strength to the motherland!

    Brought Us Warmth, National Coal Mine Worker Comrades:
    You have worked hard. Your glorious labor brings people infinite warmth and happiness. Especially for those of us recuperating in hospital beds, when the cold wind blows outside the house and snowflakes are falling, we can celebrate the Spring Festival warmly inside the house, how can we not deeply thank you! For the warmth of the people, you resolutely sacrificed personal interests, warmly responded to the call of the Party and the country, and contributed your holidays to produce more coal for the country. Many people also refunded the train tickets they had already bought to go home, and some even postponed their happy wedding dates. This is so touching!
    Comrades, your great selfless spirit of the working class has inspired the people of the whole country and has also inspired us. We must take good care of ourselves, strive to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible, and contribute our share to socialist construction.

    向煤矿职工致敬
      感谢你们的支援煤矿职工兄弟们：
    你们为了缓和国家第一季度工业生产和民用煤炭供应紧张的情况，而毅然贡献出春节期间两天假期的行动，使我们受到深深的感动。我们知道，在社会主义建设中，你们——可敬爱的煤矿职工兄弟们，一直是辛苦地进行着劳动。在这盛大的节日里，你们又牺牲了跟家人欢聚、探亲访友、观剧娱乐的机会，完成了国家给予的紧急而光荣的任务。这是多么令人感佩的伟大的忘我精神啊！你们的行动充分体现了我们工人阶级艰苦勤劳的优良作风和“一切为了社会主义”的高贵品质。为此，我们钢铁工人向你们致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意。
    煤是我们的食粮。没有它，我们就不能进行生产。你们的辛勤劳动，就是对我们的支援。当我们看到金色的铁水从炉中源源流出的时候，我们就会想到这里面包含着你们忘我劳动的成果，而深深地感谢你们。当我们欢度春节的时候，我们高高举杯，祝你们身体健康。
    为了给国家生产更多、更好的铁，我们昼夜在紧张地劳动着。在春节的时候，我们绝大部分的同志仍然坚持在工作岗位上。今后，我们将更加努力提高生产。同志们！让我们在不同的生产战线上，为了胜利地完成国家计划而共同携手前进吧！　石景山钢铁厂全体职工
    向你们学习亲爱的煤矿职工同志们：
    我们怀着感激和尊敬的心情，向您们——为缓和煤炭供应紧张情况而贡献假日两天的煤矿全体职工同志们致以衷心的崇高敬意。
    同志们！在春节里，当我们听到室内的暖气发出吱吱的响声的时候，当我们在厨房里添煤的时候，当我们看到锅炉的烟筒在冒着轻烟的时候，当我们听到火车的轰鸣的时候，当我们看到明亮的电灯的时候，我们就想到这些宝贵的光和热，都是和你们辛勤的劳动分不开的。正如人民日报社论所指出的：“为了别人的快乐而牺牲自己快乐的人永远是人民群众的模范，永远值得人们的感激和尊敬！”
      同志们！你们自觉地为国家克服困难和勇于自我牺牲的精神，是值得我们学习的。我们要学习您们艰苦勤劳的优良作风，我们要以节约煤、水、电等行动来支援您们。
    中国教育工会
    北京矿业学院全体会员
    鼓舞和教育了我们亲爱的煤矿职工同志们：
    你们放弃了春节回家团圆的幸福生活，有的还延迟了婚期，牺牲假日为国家增产煤炭，这种高度的劳动热情鼓舞了我们，教育了我们！
    我们除向你们表示慰问以外，也向你们保证：在向军事科学进军的道路上，要克服一切困难，勤苦钻研，以便熟练手中的武器，掌握技术，来捍卫我们伟大的祖国。愿我们在不同的岗位上，共同为祖国贡献出一切力量！
    解放军战士
          米日庸、汤孟范、李俭
    给我们带来了温暖全国煤矿职工同志们：
    你们辛苦了。你们光荣的劳动，给人们带来了无限的温暖和幸福。特别是我们这些在医院病床上休养的人们，当屋子外面吹着寒风，飘着雪花的时候，我们却能在屋子里面温暖地欢度春节，这怎能不使我们深深地感谢你们呢！为了人们的温暖，你们毅然牺牲个人的利益，热烈响应党和国家的号召，贡献出自己的假期，为国家多生产煤炭。许多人还退了已经买好的回家的火车票，有的人甚至推迟了美满的婚期。这使人太感动了！
    同志们，你们这种工人阶级的伟大无私的精神，鼓舞了全国人民，也鼓舞了我们。我们一定要好好休养，争取早日出院，为社会主义建设贡献出自己的一份力量。北京市耳鼻喉医院	  二号病房二十六名休养员
