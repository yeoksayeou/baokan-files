Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 26th. This year, Sichuan Province plans to ship out 2.7 million to 2.8 million tons of grain, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. As of February 20th, more than 340,000 tons of grain have been transported to the Northeast, North China, East China, and Northwest regions via the Yangtze River and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, including the well-known Karamay oil mining area and the Sanmenxia Yellow River construction site.

Sichuan Province, which has achieved bumper harvests for consecutive years, reached a total grain output of 44.5 billion jin last year, an increase of 10% compared to 1955. Since last autumn's harvest, farmers in various regions have successively sold surplus grain to the state. Due to the sharp increase in grain storage in rural warehouses in various regions, the busy transportation season has arrived earlier in the first quarter this year. Now, on rural roads in mountainous, hilly, and plain areas, teams of porters and cart drivers transporting grain are constantly moving. They concentrate large quantities of grain to ports and wharves along rivers and roads, and railway stations, and then transship them out of the province.

    川粮外运量今年将增加一半
    新华社成都26日电　今年四川省计划运出粮食二百七十万吨到二百八十万吨，比去年增加50％以上。到2月20日止，已有三十四万多吨粮食通过长江航路和宝成铁路运到东北、华北、华东和西北等地区，其中包括著名的克拉玛依油矿区和黄河三门峡工地。
    连年获得丰收的四川省，去年粮食总产量达到四百四十五亿斤，比1955年增加10％。各地农民从去年秋收以后陆续出售余粮给国家。由于各地农村仓库的粮食储存量激增，因而今年运输的繁忙季节提早在第一季度到来。现在在山区、丘陵区和平坝地区的乡村道路上，运粮的挑运队和车运队络绎不绝。他们把大批粮食集中到江河沿岸的港口码头和公路、铁路车站，然后再转运出省。
