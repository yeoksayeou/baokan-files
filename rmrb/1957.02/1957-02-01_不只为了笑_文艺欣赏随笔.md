    Not Just For Laughs
    --Essays on Literary Appreciation Wang Chaowen
    I live in a large building outside Beijing. Those who fear quiet, unless their ears are failing, will certainly not feel lonely living here.
    The most overwhelming sound is the new-style scrap collector's cry. The style and manner are very different from the "drum beaters." Not only do they shout loudly, but they also use megaphones for amplification, fearing that people's ears are not working well. When you are concentrating and not expecting their visit, suddenly, unexpectedly, you hear a shout of "Comrades!..." It's truly enough to make one suffer.
    Vegetable sellers and broken ironware repairmen, although their voices are also loud, are not so jarring. They are drawn out, with attention to intonation, unhurried. This reminds me of the cries of peddlers in Chengdu and Hangzhou. Even in the deep of night, though the sound is loud, it is not so harsh. This kind of cry seems to be the same everywhere: in order to attract attention, expand influence, adapt to the various living conditions of the masses (including those using their brains), and avoid becoming a malignant stimulus, a not-so-harsh way of calling out is used.
    This makes me think about the relationship between theater and the audience. Of course, theater is different from the cries of peddlers. However, in terms of how to adapt to the audience and then act upon the audience, the two are not without similarities.
    The theater can be said to be a lecture hall teaching people how to behave, and the formation of many people's good qualities is related to watching plays. But rather than saying that people go to the theater for education, it is better to say that they go to find entertainment. Of course, it is not only entertainment that can meet the needs of the audience, but entertainment is an important factor in whether drama can reach a broad audience. It is not to say that only making people laugh counts as entertainment, but making people laugh is an important factor in whether drama can entertain the audience. The seriousness and entertainment value of art are not opposed to each other; serious ideological content can also be embodied in a relaxed form. Traditional drama has always emphasized educational effect; however, it does not put on a pose of educating people, but first makes people feel intimate. It entertains people, so that they are influenced by thought unconsciously. Even tragedies, such as "Liu Yin Ji," do not neglect entertainment value. As for comedies, they pay even more attention to "happy events." As long as it is not pandering to the audience with gimmicks, catering to low tastes, or spreading yellow poison, it not only does not hinder the clarity of the content, but also helps to expand and deepen the influence of the content.
    The Sichuan opera currently meeting audiences in Beijing, like other local operas, is a genre that can closely combine seriousness and entertainment. The dozens of programs brought by the actors, such as the full-length opera "One Shoe," "Radish Garden," and the selected scene "Beautiful Bridal Chamber," are both serious and humorous. It doesn't make the audience feel like they are listening to a lecture in the theater because it has positive content.
    When "One Shoe" was rehearsing in Beijing, the audience laughed from beginning to end. People who were not very familiar with Sichuan opera also said that they really couldn't help but laugh. This play is actually absurd: how can there be a tiger asking someone to deliver its baby, or a person asking a tiger to arbitrate a grievance? But it is not absurd either: these two tigers, like the old couple (rural doctors) who befriend them, are kind people, fair people, and brave people; although they cannot speak human language. The clever and imaginative playwright uses a fan as a thread to connect the old couple with the tigers, the county magistrate, and the yamen runners, showing the excellent qualities of the tiger and Mother Mao as good people, and also making the ugliness of the county magistrate and the yamen runners exposed in the laughter of the audience.
    This comedy, built on the foundation of life, gives people the impression of, as it were, "I didn't mean to tell a joke, but who knew the joke would force itself on people" (Li Yu). When Mother Mao (the female doctor) is drunk before meeting the tiger, the drunken words and actions she speaks when she can't stand still are both funny and consistent with the character and her situation. She doesn't believe she is drunk, and says to herself: "Would I believe you if you fell?" Before she finishes speaking, "Oops," she slowly collapses. This is very amusing. But her demeanor of trying to hold on but failing to do so is real and natural, reminding people of the hearty old women in the Sichuan countryside. Towards Mother Mao, the playwright's attitude is humorous, but towards the county magistrate, he often adopts sharp satire. The county magistrate, frightened by the tiger, is so confused that he asks the tiger's name and origin. And that's not all. When people say that tigers don't have such things, and advise him not to ask these questions, he replies solemnly, "This is the rule for the magistrate to hear cases." This county magistrate, who pays so much attention to rules and still wants to show off his airs, neglects that the one being interrogated is not the common people who are usually interrogated, but it doesn't care about your rules. This laughable sentence is not just a hard-to-believe joke without basis. It can be said that behind the laughter hides a profound realistic meaning that still has a role to play in today's reality.
    The comedy "Radish Garden," with anti-feudal ethics as its main ideological content, the scene where the engaged couple who everyone is interested in meet in the radish garden, is laughable, but it is not a simple, thoughtless amusement. Even the scene where the Minister of Rites quarrels with his son-in-law embodies a serious theme in a similar form. This way of expressing conflict is very interesting: the two parties involved appear very serious. Because they are so serious, it is even more laughable. One wrongly accuses his future son-in-law and daughter of having an affair, and the other thinks his father-in-law is dissatisfied with his behavior of going out to play privately. One is unwilling to make public what he considers to be damaging to the family reputation, and the other blames his father-in-law for regretting the marriage because he is poor. Contrary to the audience's expectations, the quarrel between the two develops further, the more they say, the more wrong it becomes, and the more they say, the more laughable it is. Wonderful: the audience knows that this quarrel between the two can be avoided, is unnecessary, but cannot help but be attracted to it.
    If it can be said that one of the important characteristics of this play is to ridicule the Minister of Rites' credulity, rash judgments, and stubbornness, then in this scene, it not only repeatedly ridicules these characteristics of him, but also allows him to fully expose these characteristics with his own words and deeds. The words and deeds of the groom in another Sichuan opera, "Beautiful Bridal Chamber," are different in all aspects from this Minister of Rites. But he clings to his own prejudices, mistakenly believing that the bride is the ugly woman he once saw, and his thoughts are similar in nature to the Minister of Rites. Similarly, the dramatic artists also adopted a relaxed approach, tightly grasping his mistakes or shortcomings -- not investigating or researching, and repeatedly and fully ridiculing them.
    Towards these people's mistakes or shortcomings, and even sins, the dramatists are uncompromising. However, this spirit of uncompromising is not embodied in blowing beards and glaring eyes, pointing fingers, and appearing agitated. Rather than saying that the dramatists are too "welfarist" towards them, it is better to say that in order for art to be more accessible to the majority of people and have a greater educational effect, they avoid rigid preaching.
    The Sichuan opera performed in Beijing this time is not without its shortcomings. Its advantages are by no means only the ability to combine serious content with entertainment value. But I believe that in order for art to be more accessible to the people, this advantage is still very worthy of our consideration, so as to strive to fully utilize the special laws of drama, especially comedy.

    不只为了笑
    ——文艺欣赏随笔	王朝闻
    我住在北京城外一座大楼里。怕清静的人，除了耳朵不灵的，住在这儿决不至于感到寂寞。
    最能压倒一切声音的声音，是新式的收买破烂的叫喊。那气派和“打小鼓的”很不一样。不只大喊大叫，而且，唯恐人们的耳朵都不灵似的，还用扩音器助威。当你正在用心思、没有想到他们会光临的时候，突然，出人意料之外，来一声“同志们！……”真是，够人受的。
    卖菜的，修补破铁器的，虽然声音也不小，却不那么刺耳。拖长着，讲究抑扬顿挫，从容不迫。这使我回想起成都和杭州的小贩的叫声。尽管是在深夜，声音很响，听起来也不那么刺耳。这种叫法似乎各地都一样：为了引人注意，扩大影响，适应各种生活状况的群众（包括正在用脑子），避免成为恶性刺激，运用了不很刺耳的叫法。
    这使我想到戏剧和观众之间的关系的问题。当然，戏剧和小贩的叫喊不同。可是，就怎样和观众相适应然后才起作用于观众这一点而论，两者不是没有相似之处的。
    戏园子可以说是教人应该怎样做人的讲坛，很多人的优良品质的形成和看戏有关。但与其说人们进戏园子是为了受教育，不如说是去找娱乐。当然，不是只有娱乐性才能适应观众的需要，但娱乐性是戏剧能否接近广大观众的重要因素。并不是说只有逗人笑才算是娱乐性，但逗人笑是戏剧能否娱乐观众的重要因素。艺术的严肃性和娱乐性不是对立的，严肃的思想内容，也可以体现在轻松的形式之中。传统的戏剧，从来就讲究教育作用；不过，它不摆着要教育人的架式，首先是使人感到亲切。它娱乐着人们，使人在不知不觉的状况之下受到思想的影响。即令是悲剧，例如“柳荫记”，也不忽视娱乐性。至于喜剧，更讲究“乐事”。只要它不是讨好观众的噱头，低级趣味的迎合，黄色毒素的散播，它不仅不妨碍内容的明确，而且有利于内容的影响的扩大和深入。
    正在北京和观众见面的川剧，也和别的地方戏一样，是能够使严肃性和娱乐性密切结合的剧种。演员们带来的几十个节目，例如大戏“一只鞋”，“萝卜园”，折子戏“美洞房”，都是又严肃又滑稽的。不因为它有积极的内容而使观众觉得是在戏园子里听课。
    “一只鞋”在北京彩排的时候，从头至尾观众都笑。和川剧接近不多的人也说，实在忍不住要笑。这个戏，其实荒唐：世上那有老虎请人接生，人请老虎辩冤的事情。但也并不荒唐：这两个老虎，像跟它们做朋友的老夫妇（乡村医生）那样，是善良的人，公正的人，勇敢的人；虽然它们不会说人话。聪明的富于幻想的剧作者，用一把扇子作为引线，把老两口儿与老虎、县官、衙役联系起来，显示了作为好人的虎和毛大娘夫妇的优良品格，也使得县官和衙役的丑态，在观众的笑声中暴露无遗。
    这个建立在生活基础上的喜剧，它给人的印象，正所谓“我本无心说笑话，谁知笑话逼人来”（李渔）。醉了的毛大娘（女医生）遇虎之前，酒性发作，站立不住的时候所说的酒话和行为，又可笑又合于人物性格及其处境。她不相信自己醉了，对自己说：“我肯信你就倒了？”话还没说完，“咦”，人就慢慢软瘫下去了。这是很逗乐的。但她那企图自持又不能自持的神气，真实，自然，使人想到四川乡下那些爽朗的老妇人。对待毛大娘，戏剧家的态度是幽默的，对待县官，却常常采用了尖刻的讽刺。被老虎吓坏了的县官，竟糊涂到这样的程度：问老虎的名姓和籍贯。这还不说。人们说老虎没有这些名堂，劝他别问这些的时候，他还正正经经地回答道：“这是老爷问案的规矩”。这位太讲究规矩、还想摆摆架子的县官，他忽略了被审问的不是平时受审的老百姓，它是不管你这一套规矩的。这一句可笑的话，完全不是没有根据的硬滑稽。可以说，在笑的背后隐藏着深刻的对于今天的现实也还有作用的现实意义。
    以反封建礼教为主要思想内容的喜剧“萝卜园”，大家都感兴趣的未婚夫妇在萝卜园里相遇的那一场，是引人发笑的，但它不是简单的无思想的逗乐。就是礼部尚书和女婿争吵那一场戏，也是用类似的形式体现着严肃的主题。这种表现冲突的方式很有趣：两个当事人表现得一本正经。因为很正经，所以更可笑。一个错怪了未婚女婿和女儿偷情，一个以为岳父是因为自己私自上街玩耍的行为不满。一个不愿把他所认为败坏门风的事公开出来，一个怪岳父嫌贫悔亲。出乎观众的意料之外，两人的争执向前发展，愈说愈不对头，愈说愈可笑。妙得很：观众明知这两个人的争吵是可以避免的，无谓的，可是，却不能不被它所吸引。
    如果可以说这个戏的重要特点之一是嘲笑礼部尚书的轻信、妄断和固执，那么，就在这一场，不只是翻来复去地嘲笑他的这些特点，而且是让他自己用自己的言行来尽情地把这些特点暴露出来。另一川剧“美洞房”里的新郎的言行，各方面都和这一个礼部尚书不同。但他死抱住自己的成见，错以为新娘是他曾经见过的丑女子，其思想在性质上和礼部尚书相似。同样地，戏剧艺术家也是采取了轻松的方式，紧紧抓住他的错误或缺点——不调查不研究，翻来复去地尽情加以嘲笑。
    对于这些人的错误或缺点，以至罪过，戏剧家们是毫不妥协的。但，这种不妥协的精神，却不体现在吹胡子瞪眼、指手划脚和显得激动的姿态之中。与其说戏剧家对于他们太“温情主义”，不如说是为了艺术更能够和多数人接近，更有教育作用，避免了生硬的说教。
    这次在北京演出的川剧，不是没有缺点的。它们的好处也决不只是能够使严肃的内容和娱乐性结合。但我以为：为了艺术更能够和人民接近，这一点好处却还很值得我们去捉摸，从而争取充分运用戏剧、特别是喜剧的特殊规律。
