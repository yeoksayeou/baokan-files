Reader's Letters

    When will the forest fire prevention problem in the Nanpan River forest area of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi be resolved?
    The area bordering Longlin Autonomous County in Guangxi, Anlong and Xingyi in Guizhou Province, and Guangnan, Qiubei, Shizong, and Luoping counties in Yunnan Province is covered with dense forests.
    Due to the local people's habit of burning mountains, forest fires occur frequently in this area. In Longlin Autonomous County, Guangxi alone, from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, there were 261 forest fires, burning over 1.2 million mu of forest, with an estimated loss of 6 million cubic meters of timber. In Sanka Township, Zhedo District, Guangnan County, Yunnan Province, a mountain fire burned for three days and three nights last March.
    In May of last year, the Ministry of Forestry agreed to the Guangxi Provincial Forestry Department's suggestion to hold a joint forest fire prevention conference in Longlin Autonomous County, Guangxi, involving relevant counties in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces. A "Provisional Measures for Joint Forest Fire Prevention in the Nanpan River Forest Area of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi Provinces (Draft)" was formulated, and resolutions were made. The joint prevention conference was very successful, but the current situation is terrible. Because the last article of the provisional measures states "These measures shall be implemented upon approval by the Ministry of Forestry," the Ministry of Forestry has not yet given any approval or instructions, so the joint prevention mechanism has not been established.
    Now is the season when mountain fires easily occur. When will the joint forest fire prevention problem at the border of the three provinces be resolved? Li Jihe

    The Mountain Fire in Guangming Township Burned for Five Days and Nights
    In early December of last year, during the days when socialist activists were holding meetings in Guangming Township, Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, a forest fire broke out not far from the Township People's Committee and lasted for five days and five nights, destroying more than 50,000 trees.
    Why were these activists not so active? It turned out that Yan, the Deputy Director of the Kaihua County Bureau of Culture and Education, who was leading the conference, fled the scene after watching the fire for a while (supposedly to attend a telephone conference in another village), which was very discouraging to the firefighters. The next day, the activists came from various villages to attend the meeting and heard that "the fire in Shuzhuang Village continues to burn." Everyone requested that the fire be put out before the meeting, but Deputy Director Yan and Branch Secretary Li replied, "Someone is already fighting the fire," and asked everyone to continue the meeting.
    On the third night, the mountain fire was burning closer and closer to the entrance of the Township People's Committee. Coincidentally, the Kaihua County film projection team came to Guangming Township to show movies that night, and the township decided to suspend the meeting and let everyone have a holiday to watch the movie. Just as the movie was at its most exciting, the forest fire on the opposite mountain was also burning particularly fiercely. Some people complained, "Tonight, one eye watches the movie, and the other eye watches the lanterns [of the firefighters]."
    Deputy Director Yan once said when educating the younger generation, "Forests are the wealth of the motherland, an important material for national socialist construction, and the main reliance for the livelihood of people in mountainous areas." But these words can only become empty theories for him. Shi Liang

    Quickly Supply Spare Parts for New Farm Tools
    Last year, the Huailai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Hebei, supplied many new farm tools to agricultural cooperatives. After a period of use, many parts of these tools have been damaged or lost and need to be repaired and replaced in order to continue to be used. However, the handicraft cooperative in the county that deals in spare parts currently has very little stock. Spring plowing is about to begin, and farmers urgently request that the farm tools be repaired. It is hoped that relevant departments will seize the opportunity to solve this problem. Otherwise, it will affect spring plowing and create difficulties for the future promotion of new farm tools. Qu Zhongxin Zhao Huanzhang

    滇黔桂三省南盘江林区防火问题何时才能解决？
    广西隆林各族自治县和贵州省的安龙、兴义及云南省的广南、丘北、师宗、罗平等县交界的地方，到处生长着茂密的树林。
    由于当地人民有烧山的习惯，所以这一带经常发生山林火灾。仅广西隆林各族自治县，自1955年冬到1956年春天，发生的山火有二百六十一次，烧去森林一百二十多万亩，损失木材约为六百万立方公尺；云南省广南县者度区三卡乡在去年3月间，山火烧了三天三夜。
    去年5月间，林业部同意广西省林业厅的建议，请云南、贵州、广西三省有关联防各县在广西隆林各族自治县召开护林防火联防会议，订出滇、黔、桂三省南盘江林区护林防火联防暂行办法〔草案〕，并作出决议。这个联防会议开得很好，但现在的实际情况却很糟。因为暂行办法的末一条说“本办法报林业部批准执行”，到今天林业部既不作批示，也没有任何指示，所以联防机构至今未建立起来。
    现在正是山火容易发生的季节，三个省边界的护林防火联防问题何时才能解决呢？　　　李继和
    光明乡山火烧了五昼夜
    去年12月初，当社会主义积极分子在浙江省开化县光明乡召开会议的日子里，在离乡人民委员会不远的地方发生了一场延续五天五夜的山林火灾，烧毁林木五万多株。
    为什么这些积极分子这样不积极呢？原来是领导这次大会的开化县文教局颜副局长到火场看了一会就临阵逃脱了（据说到别村开电话会议去了），这给打火的人很泄气。第二天积极分子们从各村赶来开会，听说“树庄村的火灾继续燃烧”，大家都要求先把火打灭了再开会，但颜副局长和李支书的答复是“已经有人在打”，要求大家继续开会。
    第三天晚上，山火离乡人民委员会的门口越烧越近了。正巧，开化县的电影放映队这天晚上到光明乡放映电影，乡里决议，会议停开，大家放假看电影。正当电影放得精彩的时候，对面山上的林火也烧得特别猛，有些群众不满地说：“今晚是一眼看电影，一眼看提灯”。
    颜副局长教育年青一代时曾说“森林是祖国的财富，是国家社会主义建设的重要物资，是山区人民生活的主要依靠”。但这些话对他来说只能成为空洞的理论。史　良
    快供应新式农具的零件
    河北怀来县供销社去年供应农业社很多新式农具，有些农具使用了一个时期后，已有不少零件损坏或丢失，需要修配补充才能继续使用。但该县经营零件的手工业社现在备货很少。春耕就要开始了，农民迫切要求把农具修配起来。希望有关部门抓紧解决这个问题。否则，将会影响春耕，并给今后推广新式农具造成困难。　　曲忠信　赵焕章
