    "Sacrificing to the Kitchen God" and Other Customs
    Cao Chang

    According to the old calendar, the period from the end-of-year sacrifice to the Kitchen God to the Lantern Festival on the fifteenth day of the first month all falls within the scope of the Spring Festival. These twenty-odd days have always been regarded as a grand festival in our nation's customs and habits. The written records of the past about the New Year festival tell us how the social economy gradually moved towards prosperity; but they also tell us that even during the New Year festival, the traces of class struggle were reflected.
      Sending Off and Welcoming the Kitchen God
    In superstitious legends, the Kitchen God is a "family god" sent by the Jade Emperor to reside in the homes of ordinary people. He supervises the behavior of the family and controls their good and bad fortune. At the end of each year, he goes to heaven to report to the Jade Emperor. When he leaves, the people send him off, called "sending off the Kitchen God"; estimating that he has been gone for a few days, and returns, they have to welcome him back, called "welcoming the Kitchen God." These two rituals together are generally called "sacrificing to the Kitchen God."
    The ritual of sending off the Kitchen God is quite grand, requiring the preparation of offerings, and even the beans for the Kitchen God's mount. After the ceremony, the statue of the Kitchen God is burned, and the Kitchen God goes to heaven. After a few days, usually on New Year's Eve, a new statue of the Kitchen God is pasted up, which is to welcome him back from heaven. The offering is only a cup of tea, because the rituals of sending off and welcoming the Kitchen God have different levels of complexity, so generally speaking, sacrificing to the Kitchen God only refers to sending him off.
    On the shrine of the Kitchen God, there is a common couplet: "Report good things to heaven, protect peace in the lower realms." This is the purpose and wish of the people in offering sacrifices to the Kitchen God.
    In order to prevent the Kitchen God from talking too much when he goes to heaven, a special kind of malt candy is prepared as an offering. It is very sticky when eaten. The idea is that the Kitchen God will have difficulty speaking after eating this kind of candy, so he can say less or not say anything at all. This candy is called "Kitchen God candy." The manufacturing methods and forms vary from place to place, but the raw materials are generally the same. Many older people, when recalling their childhood, often think of Kitchen God candy; it has both a beautiful mythological color and a special "hometown flavor."
    The date for sending off the Kitchen God in the old days had an unwritten rule, called: "Military on the 23rd, civilians on the 24th, prostitutes on the 25th." 23rd, 24th, and 25th are abbreviations for the twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth.
    This unwritten rule was probably established during the Ming Dynasty. At that time, the military families were all descendants of meritorious officials, very prominent, and were the domineering rulers in the local areas. Sacrificing to the Kitchen God had to be done by them first; only after they had finished sacrificing were ordinary people allowed to sacrifice. As for prostitutes, they were a class of "lowly people."
    Initially, this unwritten rule seemed to be strictly enforced, and no deviation was allowed. If anyone did not comply and moved the date forward, if discovered, they would be beaten or even punished.
    In the last period of feudalism, gradually no one cared about such trivial matters, and everyone sacrificed to the Kitchen God on the 23rd.
      The Chief Seat at the Reunion Dinner
    New Year's Eve is the most abundant meal of the year. This meal is called "reunion dinner."
    The reunion dinner is primarily a family gathering; however, other organizations and groups also routinely eat such a meal. For example, at the end of the year, shop owners would host a banquet for their employees to reward them for their hard work throughout the year.
    The boss doesn't necessarily want to invite the employees, but he has to. According to general custom, seats are arranged according to the size of the position. Sometimes, however, it is not the case, and the lower-ranking person is invited to sit in the chief seat. The person sitting in the chief seat will be fired next year. At that time, both parties understand each other, but do not say it clearly. Needless to say, this meal is very unpleasant. The boss is still pretending to be polite, "Please! Please!" But the employee is inwardly anxious, planning the way to make a living next year. Thus, a widespread saying goes: "One reunion dinner this year, one goes east and one goes west next year."
      Satire in Spring Couplets
    From the "peach charms" to ward off evil spirits to the "spring couplets" that are renewed by every household every year, there is also a thousand-year history.
    The purpose of spring couplets, although to say auspicious words and encouraging words, is actually inseparable from politics.
    In the past, there was a spring couplet that read: "Imperial grace is vast as spring, literary rule shines like the sun." Everyone loved to copy a pair and paste it on their door. It is said that this couplet was written by Emperor Shizong of Ming Dynasty and bestowed upon a minister. Later, spring couplets like "National grace and family celebration, people's longevity and year's abundance" could not deviate from this format.
    How could the common people all love to praise "sacred virtues"; there were also people who used the form of spring couplets to express their dissatisfaction with the politics of the time. For example, in the early years of the Republic of China, when Yuan Shikai was the president, there was a spring couplet that read: "The people are still the same, the country is still the same; in short, unify them." This was a profound satire of the "Republican president." Also at that time, a spring couplet on a land temple read: "The public says the public is right, the woman says the woman is right; you celebrate your New Year, I celebrate my New Year."
      A Poem about the Lantern Festival
    The Lantern Festival is called the "Lantern Festival." Lanterns are hung from the thirteenth day and taken down on the eighteenth day. In ancient times, it was very lively. The government made lanterns, such as the large lanterns called "Ao Mountain," and there were also various entertainment and banquet programs. Anyway, they used the people's hard-earned money and squandered it as much as possible, not to mention it. The most hateful thing was that in order to whitewash peace, the general public was ordered to hang at least one colored lantern per household. If they did not hang one, it was illegal. As a result, some people suffered a lot of exploitation caused by lanterns, and some even went bankrupt because of it.
    There is a poem that says: "A lantern for a rich family, a grain of millet in the granary; a lantern for a poor family, father and son cry face to face. Does the romantic governor know, still hate that the flute music has no wonderful tune." It is clearly a joyful festival, but it is made to "father and son cry face to face." How hateful the feudal rulers are!

    “祭灶”及其他	草厂
    按旧历，从年底的祭灶，到正月十五闹元宵，都属于春节的范畴。这二十多天，在我们民族的生活风俗习惯中，一直被当作盛大的节日。前人关于年节的文字记载，告诉了我们，社会经济，如何逐步走上繁荣；却也告诉了我们，即便是过年过节，其中也反映了阶级斗争的痕迹。
      送灶和接灶
    在迷信传说中，灶神是玉皇大帝所派，驻在老百姓家中的“家神”。他监督一家行为，掌管一家吉凶。每年年底，要上天向玉皇大帝去做汇报。在他去的时候，老百姓给他送行，名叫“送灶”；估计他去了几天，仍然回来，就得给他接风，名叫“接灶”。这两个节目合在一起，总名叫“祭灶”。
    送灶的仪式相当隆重，要备供品，甚至还准备好了灶神坐骑所用的料豆。行过礼，把灶神神像焚化，灶神上天去了。过几天，一般是年三十晚上，贴上新的灶神神像，这就是把他从天上接回来了。所供的却不过清茶一杯，因为送灶和接灶的仪式有繁简的不同，所以一般称祭灶，都只指送灶。
    在灶神神龛上有一副通用的对联：“上天奏好事，下界保平安。”这就是老百姓供灶神的目的和愿望。
    为了怕灶神上天时多话，在送灶的祭品中，就特制一种麦糖，吃起来很粘牙。意思说，灶神吃了这种糖，说话困难，就可以少说或者不说了。这种糖，叫做“灶糖”，各地制造方法和形式不一，原料却大体相同。很多年纪大一点的人，回忆儿时，每每会想起灶糖来；灶糖是既带有美丽神话色彩，又有一种特别的“家乡风味”的。
    送灶的日期，古老的年代里，有个不成文法，叫做：“军三、民四、王八五。”三、四、五，是二十三、二十四、二十五的省称。
    这个不成文法，可能是明代规定的。当时军家，都是功臣后裔，十分显赫，在地方上，是豪霸的统治者。祭灶要让他先祭；他祭完了，一般老百姓才许祭。至于王八，是指娼妓“贱民”一类的人。
    最初，这个不成文法，好像执行的很严，不许错乱。如果有谁不遵守，提前了日子，被发觉了，小则挨打，大则受刑。
    封建的最后期，渐渐地没有人管这样的闲事了，大家就全都在二十三日这一天祭灶。
      团圆饭的首席
    除夕是一年中最为丰富的一餐。这一餐叫做“团圆饭”。
    团圆饭固然主要是家庭中的聚餐；但在其它组合中，也照例要吃这么一顿。例如说，商店，到了年终，老板要办酒请伙计们，以酬一年辛苦。
    老板请伙计，不一定是愿意请的，却是不得不请的。一般习惯，按职位大小，排列座次。有时却又不然，把职位低的却请了坐首席。这个坐首席的，到明年就是被解雇的。当时彼此心照，并不言明。不用说，这餐饭吃得是很不愉快了。老板还在假情假义地“请！请！”伙计却是内心焦苦，筹划明年谋生的道路。这样，广泛流传一句话，说的是：“今年一顿团圆饭，明年一个东来一个西。”
      春联的讽刺
    从辟邪辟鬼的“桃符”，发展成为一年一度、万户更新的“春联”，也有千年的历史了。
    春联的目的，虽然在说吉利话，说勉励话，其实也还是离不开政治的。
    在以前，有一副春联，写的是：“皇恩春浩荡，文治日光华。”大家都爱照抄一副，贴在自己门前。据说，这副春联乃是明世宗写了赐与一个大臣的。后来什么“国恩家庆，人寿年丰”之类的春联，都离不开这一套规格。
    老百姓岂能全爱颂扬“圣德”；也尽有人，利用春联这一形式，表示对当时政治的不满。例如，民国初年，袁世凯做大总统，在某处有副春联，写的是：“民犹是也，国犹是也；总而言之，统而言之。”对于“民国总统”作出深度的讽刺。也就在那个时候，一个土地庙上的春联写道：“公说公有理，婆说婆有理；你过你的年，我过我的年。”
      元宵一首诗
    元宵节，叫做“灯节”，十三上灯，十八落灯，古时十分热闹。官府扎灯，有所谓“鳌山”之类的大灯，还有多种戏耍饮宴的节目。反正用的是民脂民膏，尽量挥霍，且不说它。最为可恶的，乃是为了粉饰太平，限令一般老百姓，每家至少要挂一盏彩灯。如若不挂，便是违法。这样，使得一些老百姓，受到许多由灯而起的剥削，竟有因之倾家荡产的。
    有一首诗说：“富家一盏灯，太仓一粒粟；贫家一盏灯，父子相对哭。风流太守知不知，犹恨笙歌无妙曲。”明明是一个欢乐的节日，却弄得“父子相对哭”，封建统治者是多么令人可恨啊！
