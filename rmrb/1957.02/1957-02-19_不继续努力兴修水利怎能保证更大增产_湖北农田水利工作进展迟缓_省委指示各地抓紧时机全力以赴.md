How can we guarantee greater production without continuing to work hard on water conservancy?
Slow progress in farmland water conservancy in Hubei Province
Provincial Party Committee instructs all localities to seize the opportunity and go all out

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 17th (by Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Zhuang): The progress of farmland water conservancy construction in Hubei Province has been slow, and the province's leading organs have taken measures to change this situation.

In order to strive for a greater harvest this year, Hubei Province plans to continue to raise and thicken the dikes in the areas along the rivers and lakes so that they can withstand greater floods. In the plains and hilly areas, it is planned to build and renovate more than 460,000 small reservoirs and ponds. In the mountainous areas, soil and water conservation work should be done well. After the completion of these projects, the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 2.55 million mu, and the irrigation area can be improved by more than 8 million mu. After this plan was determined, some areas began water conservancy construction work since last winter. Judging from the progress, wherever the leadership has seriously strengthened leadership, farmland water conservancy work has momentum, scale, and has achieved great results. For example, the Xiangyang area in the dry crop area has always been a famous low-yield area. In order to change the face of this area, leading cadres of various counties personally took action and went deep into the field, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the farmers in building water conservancy projects. The reservoirs and ponds newly built and renovated in many places are more numerous, faster, better, and more economical than last year. The farmland water conservancy projects already completed in Guanghua County alone can turn more than 60,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. However, there are still many areas in this province that are in another situation. They believe that a lot of water conservancy projects have been built in the past, and it does not matter if they are not repaired now. In addition, there was more rural work last winter, so the farmland water conservancy work was not arranged until late December last year and early this year. At the same time, individual areas lack strong leadership, and Yingshan County even drew the main cadres of the water conservancy department to do other work. In this way, farmland water conservancy work almost fell into a state of laissez-faire. The Huanggang area plans to build and repair more than 120,000 small mountain reservoirs and ponds, but only about 25% are currently under construction and completed. The areas along the rivers and lakes believe that the dikes have been built high and strong, and floods can be resisted. They have relaxed the leadership of this year's dike maintenance work. In some places, the migrant workers on the dikes pick and rest, and some even go home without working for a day.

Now, there are only one or two months left before the busy spring plowing season. The Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Department has calculated that, taking only the dike maintenance project as an example, if it takes 40 working days and each person completes one cubic meter of soil per day, one million migrant workers need to be on the dike to complete the dike maintenance project, which guarantees the bumper harvest of farmland on both sides of the Yangtze River and the Han River. Therefore, time is tight and the task is heavy. In order to quickly change the current slow phenomenon of various water conservancy works, the relevant leading organs of Hubei Province have conducted an inspection of the completion of farmland water conservancy work plans in various places. Xiangyang, Guanghua and other counties have achieved remarkable results in water conservancy construction and have been commended and rewarded. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee instructed the local party committees to seize the opportunity, go all out, and lead the masses to change the slow state of farmland water conservancy work. According to this spirit, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Department decided that in addition to leaving one or two directors and some cadres to adhere to daily work, they will all go deep into the counties and construction sites, and strive to complete farmland water conservancy work before the arrival of the spring plowing season.

    不继续努力兴修水利怎能保证更大增产
    湖北农田水利工作进展迟缓
    省委指示各地抓紧时机全力以赴
    新华社武汉17日电　新华社记者田庄报道：湖北省的农田水利兴修工作进展迟缓，这个省的领导机关已经采取措施，决定改变这种状况。
    湖北省为了争取今年更大的丰收，沿江滨湖地区计划继续把堤防加高培厚，使它能够抵御更大的洪水。平原和丘陵地区计划新建和整修小型水库、塘堰四十六万多处。山区就要做好水土保持工作。这些工程完成以后，可以扩大灌溉面积二百五十五万多亩，改善灌溉面积八百多万亩。这个计划确定以后，从去冬以来，有些地区就开始了水利兴修工作。从进展情况看，凡是领导上认真加强领导的地方，农田水利工作就有声势，有规模，获得了巨大成绩。例如，旱作物区的襄阳专区，历来就是个著名的低产地区。为了改变这个地区的面貌，各县领导干部都亲自动手，深入现场，大大地鼓舞了农民们兴修水利的情绪，许多地方新建和整修的水库、塘堰，与去年相比，又多、又快、又好、又省。仅光化县已经完成的农田水利工程，就可把六万多亩旱地改成水田。但是，这个省还有不少地区却是另一种情况，它们认为过去已经修了不少水利工程，现在不修也不要紧，加上去冬农村工作较多，直到去年12月底和今年年初，才迟迟把农田水利工作布置下去，同时个别地区又缺乏有力地领导，应山县甚至把水利部门的主要干部抽出搞别的工作。这样，农田水利工作就几乎陷于自流状态。黄冈专区计划兴修小型山库、塘堰十二万多处，目前动工和完工的仅只有25％左右。沿江滨湖地区认为堤防已经修得高大、坚固，洪水来啦可以抵挡得住，放松了对今年堤防岁修工作的领导，有的地方民工上堤后，挑挑歇歇，甚至有的没做一天就回家了。
    现在，离繁忙的春耕季节只剩下一、两个月了。湖北省水利部门算了个账，仅以堤防岁修工程来说，若以四十个工作天，每人每天完成一公方土计算，需要一百万民工上堤，才能按期完成这项保障长江、汉水两岸广大农田丰收的堤防岁修工程。因此时间紧迫，任务繁重。为了迅速改变目前各项水利工作迟缓的现象，湖北省有关领导机关已经对各地农田水利工作计划完成情况，进行了一次检查，襄阳、光化等县兴修水利成绩显著，得到了表扬和奖励。最近，中共湖北省委指示各地党委必须抓紧时机，全力以赴，领导群众，改变农田水利工作迟缓的状态。根据这种精神，湖北省水利厅决定除留下一至两个厅长和部分干部坚持日常工作外，都深入到县、工地，争取春耕季节到来以前完成农田水利工作。
