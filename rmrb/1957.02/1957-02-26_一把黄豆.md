    A Handful of Soybeans
    Regiment Commander Zhang Shaoji
    In the summer of 1935, when our Red 25th Army advanced westward to southern Shaanxi and north of the Qinling Mountains, the Kuomintang assembled forces several times our size to pursue us. After several days and nights of fierce fighting, the higher-ups ordered us to collect four days' worth of rations while fighting, preparing to pass through the uninhabited area of southern Shaanxi.
    One gloomy morning, the troops assembled, and comrades were asking each other:
    "Are your rations enough for four days?"
    "The area is so small, we can't touch the food of poor families. How can the food of just a few landlords be enough for our thousands of troops for four days!" The squad deputy next to me muttered.
    As soon as he finished speaking, someone shouted, "What are you afraid of? There must be something to eat in those mountains. Didn't we find a lot of wild vegetables and fruits when we crossed the mountains last time?"
    Before long, the main force set off. At this time, the sky was full of dark clouds, as black as the bottom of a pot. Before we had gone far, a torrential rain poured down, soaking our clothes, and the road was slippery, making it even more difficult to walk. Before long, a mountain flood broke out, and the road was cut off. The troops had to temporarily stop at the foot of the trees by the roadside.
    After about the time it takes to smoke a bag of tobacco, the order came: "The water ahead is too high to cross. Go back." After retreating a short distance, we encountered the enemy and fought another battle.
    A day passed. After the mountain flood subsided, we advanced again along the original route. Thousands of Red Army soldiers, along the winding mountain paths, crossed the steep Qinling Mountains and entered the uninhabited area. At this time, everyone had very little food left. Each squad sent two or three comrades to find wild vegetables to mix with their rations to stave off hunger.
    On the afternoon of the second day of passing through the uninhabited area, just as the troops were preparing to camp, we suddenly heard the third platoon leader shout:
    "Attention all squads, send someone to the battalion to get meat immediately!"
    This shout stunned us. We thought: There isn't even a single person in this place, where would the meat come from?
    "Squad Leader Wang, what meat are we getting?" Liu Yuanlin asked curiously.
    Squad Leader Wang Yuqing stood there dumbfounded, looking in the direction of the shout. Only when Liu Yuanlin asked him did he turn around and say excitedly, "Isn't it that the battalion leader's livestock was slaughtered? If there were any other way, they wouldn't do it."
    On the third day, there were no livestock in the marching ranks, and everyone's rations were gone. All that was left to fill our stomachs were wild vegetables and fruits.
    At noon on the fourth day, the troops stopped in a river bend. Battalion Political Commissar Liu Zhen came over to speak to everyone.
    "Comrades! Are you hungry?"
    "No!"
    "It's not true that you're not hungry. I could eat two pounds of dry rice right now. Now it's good, there is Liangdang County about seventy or eighty li away from here. Everyone, grit your teeth and walk this stretch of road. Taking that county town will not only open up the road to victory, but also allow us to have a good 'New Year.' In this battle, our battalion is preparing to request to take on the main attack mission. Do you all think it's okay?"
    "Okay!"
    After the battalion political commissar finished speaking, everyone was discussing the new mission.
    However, Wang Yuqing didn't say anything, sitting there steadily as usual. But from his face, you could see that he was a little excited inside.
    When the companies separated for discussion, the comrades unanimously expressed their determination to take Liangdang City. When it came to fighting, some comrades said, "People are iron, food is steel, even a little bit of rice crust can solve the problem, 'moving your mouth takes three points of strength.'"
    Just then, Wang Yuqing suddenly stood up, holding a gun in one hand and carrying a backpack in the other, heading straight for the instructor.
    "Squad Leader Wang, what's the matter?"
    Wang Yuqing shook his backpack and said, "Instructor, I have saved one or two sheng of stir-fried soybeans here. Now I'm handing them over to the Party!" Then he carefully leaned the gun against a crooked-neck tree, quickly opened his backpack, took out a small, bulging pocket, and handed it to the instructor with both hands.
    This small pocket of beans was prepared by him six days ago. During the march, when he was hungry, Squad Leader Wang would rather eat wild vegetables than eat a single bean. Now he gave it all to the Party.
    After the instructor took the beans, tears streamed down his face before he could say anything. He was silent for a moment, then said to everyone, "Comrades! Squad Leader Wang has saved so many beans, everyone can get some. Now we have a way to complete the task of the assault company. The discussion is over, and we will now start distributing the beans." A portion of the bag of soybeans was left for the first and second companies, and everyone else received a handful. Finally, there was still more than half a enamel bowl left, which the instructor personally handed to Wang Yuqing.
    "Instructor, although I carried the beans, I have already handed them over to the Party. I can only get my deserved share, I shouldn't get so much," Wang Yuqing stubbornly said.
    "This is your deserved share, take it. Now, on behalf of the Party branch, I announce to you: our company is right behind the sharpshooter regiment, and your squad is the company's assault squad."
    Wang Yuqing understood the instructor's meaning, and while taking the beans with his hand, he said, "Our squad will definitely complete the task assigned by the Party!" The instructor then turned to everyone and said, "Comrades! Eat, when we are full we will go to fight."
    Everyone ate the beans while talking. The squad leader divided his half-porcelain bowl of beans into small pinches for each of us in the squad. The well-spoken comrades opened the floodgates of conversation again.
    "These soybeans are more precious than gold beans!"
    The eighty-li march began. Hey! We were full of energy. We made it through the last thirty li or so of the forced march. The mighty troops pressed straight to Liangdang City. When we waded across the river outside the east gate of Liangdang City, the enemy was still confused and didn't know who we were. It wasn't until we climbed the city gate tower and shouted to them: "Those who lay down their arms will not be killed, we are the Red Army!" that the terrified "Security Team" suddenly realized what was happening.
    At the end of the battle, Liu Yuanlin asked a prisoner playfully, "Hey! Did you know we were coming?" The prisoner stuttered, "We only knew you were hundreds of li away, we...never...thought...you...would come...so fast!" At this time, Li Qingge, who was standing aside, grinned and said, "Hmph! We only ate a handful of soybeans, if we had rice to eat, you would have become war trophies a few days ago!"

    一把黄豆
    团长　张绍基
    1935年夏天，我红二十五军西进到陕南和秦岭以北时，国民党纠集了数倍于我们的兵力赶上来了。激战几昼夜后，上级命令我们边战斗边筹集四天干粮，准备通过陕南无人区。
    在一个阴沉的早晨，部队集合了，战友们都互相询问着。
    “你的干粮够四天吃吗？”
    “地区这样小，穷人家的粮食咱们不能动，光几个地主的粮食，怎么能够咱们千军万马四天用的呢！”站在我身旁的四班副嘟囔了两句。
    他的话刚一落尾，不知是谁就拉开了嗓门搭了腔：“怕什么，那些大山上还能没有吃的，咱们上次过山时，不是找到不少野菜和野果子吗？”
    不一会儿，大队出发了，这时，天上堆满了乌云，黑得像锅底一样。没走好远，瓢泼似的大雨倒下来了，淋透了衣服，道路又滑，走起来更加困难。走了不远，山洪暴发了，路也被截断了，部队不得不暂时停在路旁的树脚下。
    约莫一袋烟的工夫，传来了命令：“前面水大，过不去，往回走。”折回走了不远，和敌人遭遇了，又干了一仗。
    一天过去了。山洪退去后，我们又向原路挺进。千万个红军战士，沿着蜿蜒的羊肠小道，翻过了险峻的秦岭，进入了无人区。这时大家带的干粮很少了。各班都派两三个同志去找野菜，以便合着干粮充饥。
    在通过无人区的第二天下午，部队正准备宿营，忽然听到三排长喊：
    “各班注意，马上派人到营里去领肉！”
    这一喊可把我们给楞住了，心想：这个地方连个人都没有，那来的肉呢？
    “王班长，领什么肉？”刘元林好奇地问。
    王玉清班长朝着喊声来的方向，呆呆地站在那里，直到刘元林问他，才转过脸来，激动地说：“还不是营首长的牲口杀了，要是有一点办法，也不能这样干。”
    第三天，行军行列里没有牲口了，大家的干粮也光了，用来充饥的只有野菜和野果子。
    第四天中午，部队停在一个河湾里，营政委刘镇同志走过来给大家讲话。
    “同志们！饿不饿？”
    “不饿！”
    “不饿是假的，就是有二斤干饭我也能吃光它。现在好了，离这个地方七、八十里路有个两当县，大家再咬咬牙，走过这段路，拿下那个县城，不但打开了通往胜利的道路，还能痛痛快快过个‘年’。在这次战斗中，咱们营准备要求担任主攻任务，大家说行不行？”
    “行！”
    营政委讲完话后，大家就你一言我一语地在议论着新的任务。
    可是，王玉清却啥话也没说，像平常一样稳稳当当地坐在那里。但从他的脸上可以看出他的内心有些激动。
    各连分开讨论时，同志们都一致表示，坚决拿下两当城。提起打仗，有的同志就说：“人是铁，饭是钢，那怕是有点锅巴也能解决问题，‘动动嘴，三分力’。”
    就在这时，王玉清忽地站起来，一只手拿着枪，一只手提着背包，照直向指导员走去。
    “王班长，你有啥事？”
    王玉清把背包用手一晃说：“指导员，我这里保存有一、二升炒熟了的黄豆，现在把它交给党吧！”随后他就小心地把枪靠在一棵歪脖子树上，迅速地打开了背包，拿出了一个装得鼓鼓的小口袋，双手递给了指导员。
    这一小口袋豆子，是他在六天前准备的。在行军中，肚子饿了，王班长宁肯吃野菜也舍不得动一粒，现在却全部交给了党。
    指导员接过豆子后，没等把话说出来，眼泪就流下来了。他沉默了片刻，就对大家说：“同志们！王班长保存了这么多豆子，每人可以分到一些。这下子完成突击连的任务可有办法了。讨论会就到这里结束，现在开始发豆子。”一袋子黄豆留下一部分给一、二连，其余的大家每个人分到了一把。最后还剩多半搪瓷碗，指导员亲手端给了王玉清。
    “指导员同志，虽然豆子是我背来的，可我已经交给党了。我只能分到应得的一份，不应该给我这么多。”王玉清固执地说。
    “这就是你应得的一份，收下吧。现在我代表党支部向你宣布：手枪团后面就是咱们连，你们班是连的突击班。”
    王玉清明白了指导员的意思，一面用手接过来豆子，一面说：“我们班一定完成党交给的任务！”指导员这时又转向了大家说了声：“同志们！吃吧，吃饱了咱们就去打仗。”
    大家一面说话，一面吃起豆子来。班长又把他那半瓷碗豆子，给我们班里每人分了一小捏。好说好道的同志，话匣子又打开了。
    “这些黄豆比金豆子还宝贵哩！”
    八十里的行军开始了。嘿！劲头可足啦，最后三十里左右的急行军，我们都顶下来了。浩浩荡荡的队伍直迫两当城下。当我们涉过两当城东门外大河时，敌人还昏头昏脑地弄不清我们是谁，一直到我们登上了城门楼，向他们喊：“缴枪不杀，我们是红军！”那些吓呆了的“保安队”才恍然大悟。
    战斗结束时，刘元林俏皮地问一个俘虏：“喂！你们知道不知道我们来？”俘虏结结巴巴地说：“我们只知道你们在百里以外，想……想不到……你们……来得……来得这么快！”这时，站在一旁的李清阁咧开了大嘴笑着说：“哼！我们还只吃了一把黄豆，若是有饭吃啊，前几天你们就当了胜利品了！”
