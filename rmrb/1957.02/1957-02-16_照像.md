    Taking a Photo
    Zhang Zhimin
    The photojournalist arrived on time,
    But the pig-raising model worker—Auntie Yu—
    Where did she go?
    The Director was anxious and complaining:
    "I told her yesterday,
    To prepare at home..."
    A child ran over to report:
    "My mom said, she's not taking the photo,
    Something is more important than this..."
    The Director pressed him: "What is it?"
    The child clapped his hands and laughed,
    "Our sow has given birth!"
    The two of them dashed outside,
    One shouting: "Good! Good! Good!"
    The other shouting: "Photo! Photo! Photo!"

    摄影记者按时来到，
    养猪模范——于大嫂
    却不知哪去了？
    社长急得发牢骚：
    “昨天我就嘱咐了她，
    让她在家准备好……”
    孩子跑来作报告：
    “我妈说，像片不照了，
    有个事儿比这还重要……”
    社长追问他：“什么事？”
    孩子拍着手儿笑，
    “咱们的母猪下崽了！”
    两人撒腿向外跑，
    一个嚷着：“好！好！好！”
    一个嚷着：“照！照！照！”
