    People Returning to Production Posts
    Resuming Special Skills

    Xinhua News Agency reporter in Tianjin reports: In the streamlining of administrative bodies in Tianjin's local industrial departments, 300 management personnel have successively gone into workshops to directly participate in production. In their new work posts, their special skills are being better utilized.

    Su Chunwang, an excellent shaving worker at the Jinan Tannery, walked to the dry shaving machine he had left for over a year on February 9th, wearing a brand-new work uniform, and pressed the button to start the machine. He picked up a piece of raw leather and skillfully fed it into the blade, causing a stream of shavings to fly in all directions. In less than three minutes, a soft, shiny piece of leather was shaved. That day, he shaved over 300 square feet of leather, setting a new daily output record for the team.

    Su Chunwang was originally a seventh-grade skilled worker. In 1955, he was transferred to be a management cadre. This year, the factory's task of manufacturing industrial leather increased. Because there were few dry shaving machines and their efficiency was low, the factory had accumulated over 7,000 square feet of semi-finished products. When he learned about this situation, he requested to participate in production from the administrative leadership; the workers also hoped that he could return to the team to help everyone improve their skills. From February 9th to 20th, he exceeded his production plan every day and actively helped everyone, increasing the team's daily output by 44%, and reducing the backlog of semi-finished products to 4,000 square feet.

    Among the many workers wearing white work uniforms in the shoe-making workshop of this factory, there was a person wearing a blue uniform. He was bent over his work table, briskly arranging shoe uppers. This was Wang Fenglou, the secretary of the Party branch of the workshop, who had just returned to his production post. Fang Hengjun, a rationalization proposal member of the production section, also returned to the workshop with him. They were originally skilled workers in the lasting group. Recently, because the production of the lasting group could not meet the needs of the bottoming group, they voluntarily returned to their production posts. They formed a core group with the team leader to study operating methods and improve labor organization. Seeing the secretary of the Party branch taking the lead in participating in production, the workers were very excited. Now, the team's monthly output has increased from 128 pairs to about 190 pairs.

    Zhu Shulan, a staff member of the personnel section of the Beiyang Textile Factory, had just returned to the spinning workshop and was unfamiliar with the machine conditions and operating techniques. Although she patrolled back and forth in the roving frame, she still missed many yarn tubes that she couldn't connect, and even found it difficult to break the roving strips. Her fingers were chafed after the first day of work, but she was not discouraged at all. After persisting in her work for a few days, she gradually became familiar with the operation, her output increased, and she was able to complete her quota every day.

    The Rebirth of the Chimney Team

    Xinhua News Agency reporter in Taiyuan, Sha Yin, reports: Since returning to his production post, He Yongming, together with his partners, exceeded their quota for the ninth working day by 20% on the 17th. On the 18th, he climbed onto the nine-meter-high scaffolding on the construction site and nervously tied the reinforcing steel for the seismic belt, beginning his tenth working day.

    He Yongming is an old skilled worker of the First Engineering Company of the Seventh Metallurgical Construction Corporation and the captain of the chimney team. In 1953, he was awarded the title of Provincial Labor Model in Heilongjiang Province. After coming to Taiyuan with the company in 1955, his team was selected as the model team of the corporation. Last year, in the advanced producer movement, he and his chimney team exceeded their plan every month and saved more than 6,000 yuan worth of building materials. Last November, he was transferred to be a foreman, separating him from production. After he left, the chimney team wasted more than 1,000 jin of mortar and the quality of the project decreased in nearly three months. At the beginning of February this year, the company leadership suggested that he return to his production post, which he happily accepted.

    On February 9th, he returned to the production team. He immediately called a meeting of the workers and rationally adjusted the labor organization based on everyone's opinions. In addition, after work every day, he would check the work situation of that day. As a result, in these ten days, whether it was grouting or tying reinforcing steel, not only could they exceed the quota, but the quality of the project also improved.

    Like He Yongming, recently, more than 30 workers from the First Engineering Company have returned to their production posts from management positions.

    Female Planners Resume Old Careers

    Xinhua News Agency reporter in Shenyang, Jin Yuanqing, reports: More than ten days ago, two female planners from the punching and shearing workshop of the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory—Hou Fenglan and Qian Yingzhi—who had been transferred from among the workers to management positions in the past, returned to their production posts.

    When Hou Fenglan returned to the team, she first discovered that half of the twenty workers were new workers who had entered the factory after she became a planner three years ago. They had little production experience, and the plans were not thorough. Therefore, the team often experienced shutdowns, which often affected the normal production of the next process. Therefore, Hou Fenglan quickly helped everyone to make a good production plan; at the same time, when each lathe was running, she prepared all the materials and tools needed for the next job. From then on, there was no more interruption of production.

    In the past ten days, Qian Yingzhi has also been busy changing the chaotic situation in the team and enthusiastically helping young workers strengthen their sense of responsibility. When she first arrived in the team, she saw parts piled all over the floor, and damaged molds were put into the warehouse without inspection, which would affect the quality of the next use. Now, the team has changed. Everyone takes the initiative to check the quality and quantity after finishing their work each time; after the molds are used, they are carefully inspected before being put into the warehouse; the parts, materials, and tools next to the machine tools are also cleaned up neatly.

    He Returned to the Driver's Seat

    Xinhua News Agency reporter in Hubei, Feng Jian, reports: Yu Junxiang, a young crane operator on the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company construction site, has been back at the construction site from the personnel section, resuming his driver's work, for a full three months. In the past three months, Yu Junxiang and his companions in the same car have been driving a red crawler crane from the Metallurgical Power Plant construction site, the Metal Structure Factory construction site, to the factory front area construction site, happily completing the lifting of roof trusses, roof panels, and other heavy objects.

    Youth League member Yu Junxiang was transferred away from the crane to the office of the construction machinery station at the construction site to do personnel work more than a year ago. This time, when he returned to the crane's driver's seat, some of the techniques he had learned before had become unfamiliar. However, thanks to the enthusiastic help of the captain, Li Yunlou, and other companions, as well as his own hard work, now, when he lifts objects weighing five or six tons, raises and lowers the crane's hook, and rotates the crane's boom, he can operate them steadily.

    回到生产岗位上的人们
    重新发挥专长
    新华社驻天津记者报道　天津市地方工业部门在精简管理机构中，已经有三百名管理人员先后走进车间直接参加了生产，在新的工作岗位上，他们的专长得到了更好的发挥。
    津南制革厂优秀的削里工人苏春旺，在2月9日穿着崭新的工作服走到离别一年多的干削机前面，按动电钮把机器开动起来。他拿起一张原皮熟练地送进刀口，一股股碎屑向四方迸飞。不到三分钟，一张柔软光亮的皮子就削好了。在这一天，他削好皮子三百多平方尺，创造了全组日产量最高纪录。
    苏春旺原是七级技术工人，1955年被调作管理干部。今年工厂制造工业用革的任务增加了，因为干削机少效率又低，工厂曾经积压半成品七千多平方尺。当他知道这种情况以后，就向行政领导方面提出参加生产的要求；工人们也盼望他能回到小组帮助大家提高技术。从2月9日到20日，他每天都超额完成生产计划，并且积极帮助大家，使全组的日产量提高44％，积压的半成品也减少到四千平方尺。
    这个工厂制鞋车间的许多穿着白工作服的工人中间，有一个穿着蓝制服的人，他伏在工作案上轻快地整理着鞋帮。这是车间的中共支部书记王凤楼，他刚刚回到生产岗位上。同他同时回车间的，还有生产科合理化建议员方恒均。他俩原来都是帮工组的技术工人，最近由于帮工组生产不能满足底工组的需要，才自愿回到了生产岗位。他们同小组长组成核心组，研究操作方法，改进劳动组织。工人看到中共支部书记带头参加生产，情绪十分振奋，现在全组月产量已经由一百二十八双提高到一百九十双左右。
    北洋纱厂人事科职员朱淑兰刚回到细纱车间，对机器情况和操作技术都生疏了。虽然她在弄档中来回巡视着，还是空了许多纱管接不上头，甚至连弄断粗纱条子也感到费劲。第一天下了班手指就磨破了，但是她一点也不灰心。坚持工作了几天，操作逐渐熟悉起来，产量提高了，每天都能完成定额。
    烟囱队的新生
    新华社驻太原记者莎荫报道 何永铭重新回到生产岗位上以后，在17日同他的伙伴们一起超额20％完成了第九个工作日的定额。18日，他登上建筑工地上九公尺高的脚手架，紧张地绑扎着防震带的钢筋，开始了第十个工作日。
    何永铭是第七冶金建筑总公司第一工程公司的老技术工人，烟囱队的队长，1953年曾经在黑龙江省获得省级劳动模范的称号；1955年随公司来太原以后，他领导的小组又被评选为总公司的模范小组。去年，在先进生产者运动中，他同他的烟囱队月月超额完成计划，并且先后节约了价值六千多元的建筑材料。去年11月他被调任为工长，脱离了生产。他离开以后，烟囱队在近三个月中浪费了一千多斤砂浆，工程质量也降低了。今年2月初，公司领导上建议让他重新回到生产岗位上去，他愉快地接受了。
    2月9日他回到了生产队。他立刻召集工人们开会，根据大家的意见合理地调整了劳动组织。此外，每天下班以后，他还要检查这一天工作的情况。结果，这十天中，不论灌浆还是绑扎钢筋，不仅都能超过定额，而且工程质量也好转了。
    像何永铭一样，最近，第一工程公司已经有三十多个工人从管理工作岗位回到生产岗位。
    女计划员重理旧业
    新华社驻沈阳记者金原青报道  十多天以前，沈阳低压开关厂冲剪车间有两个过去从工人中间调到管理岗位上的女计划员——侯凤兰和钱英芝，重新回到了生产岗位上。
    侯凤兰回到小组，首先发现在二十个工人中，有一半是在她三年前当了计划员以后入厂的新工人，他们生产经验少，计划作的不周密，因此，小组里经常发生停车现象，往往影响下道工序不能正常生产。于是，侯凤兰便很快地帮助大家订好生产计划；同时，当每台床子开动着的时候，她就把下一手活要用的材料和工具都准备齐全。从此，就不再发生生产中断的现象了。
    钱英芝十多天来也在忙着改变小组的混乱现象，并且热心地帮助青年工人们加强责任心。当她刚到小组的时候，见到零件堆得满地都是，使坏了的模具不检查就入库，下次使用便影响质量。现在，小组里变了样，大家每次干完活都主动检查一下质量和数量；模具使完以后，都经过细心检查再入库；机床旁边的零件、材料和工具，也都清理得有条不紊。
    他又来到了驾驶台
    新华社驻湖北记者冯健报道  武钢工地上的青年起重机司机于俊祥，从人事科回到施工现场，重新开始他的司机工作，已经整整三个月了。在三个月来，于俊祥和他同车的同伴们一起，驾驶着一部红色的履带式起重机，从冶电厂工地、金属结构厂工地到厂前区工地，愉快地完成了屋架、屋面板和其它重物件的起吊工作。
    青年团员于俊祥，是在一年多以前，被调离起重机到工地建筑机械站的机关里作人事工作的。这次当他重新回到起重机的驾驶台时，原先学到的一些技术已经丢生了。但是由于机长李云楼和其他同伴的热情帮助以及他自己努力学习，现在，当他起吊五、六吨重的物件，起落起重机的吊钩，回转起重机的臂杆，都能够稳稳当当地操纵了。
