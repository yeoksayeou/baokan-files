Finding Oil Materials from Ditches
　　Hu Daoyuan

The dishwater from the dining hall and the pot-washing water from the kitchen are poured into the ditches by people who find them a bit dirty. Who would have thought that these dirty things could become industrial raw materials? Last year, a handicraft production cooperative in Beijing used these kinds of dirty things to produce 320,000 jin of industrial oil.

320,000 jin of industrial oil, if produced from vegetable oil materials, would require at least more than 2 million jin of soybeans, according to the oil extraction rate of Li Chuanjiang's workshop at the Siping Oil and Wine Factory. If all of this oil were supplied to the soap factory, it could produce more than 26,000 boxes of various soaps.

After hearing about this situation at the Beijing Daily Use Goods Production Cooperative Union, I went to visit this cooperative outside Xuanwumen.

In a very remote corner, I found the "Beijing Waste Oil Refining Production Cooperative." Upon entering, the courtyard was full of gasoline drums and large earthenware jars. Inside were the scorched "oil bottoms" from oil companies and pastry shops, the oil scum floating from meat cooked in food companies and large restaurants, and the discolored sheep intestines and beef lungs from slaughterhouses. Most of these things emitted unpleasant odors. A little better were the leftovers of mixed meat scraps, fish bones, chicken bones, and tofu pieces. Comrades from the cooperative said: "These are obtained from large restaurants and large canteens, generally free of charge. We just need to put a bucket there and transport them back regularly. These things are also not easy for them to handle; letting us take them back is also good for their sanitation work." Now, the canteens of units such as the Beijing Hotel and Tongren Hospital regularly provide them with these things. In the front yard, there was also a pile of things that looked like garbage, unrecognizable in their original form. Comrades from the cooperative said: "These are dug out from the ditches." The ditches of many enterprises, organizations, and schools have become a good source of raw materials for this production cooperative. In August last year, the "sludge" dug out from the ditch of a factory once yielded more than 170 jin of oil.

Digging for oil refining materials from ditches was something that few people did before the cooperative was organized. Ditches are very dirty, smelly in summer, and cold in winter. Going down into the ditch often results in being covered in stinky mud. However, none of the members of this cooperative disliked the dirt or the fatigue. As soon as digging ditches was mentioned, they rushed to go. Because they believe that there are usable things in the ditches, and not digging them out would be a waste. Especially after the recent launch of the production increase and economy campaign in various units, the amount of "oil bottoms" and leftover scraps has decreased, so they have made digging ditches an important source of raw materials.

The oil refined from such raw materials has many uses. Soap factories use this oil to make various soaps. The putty factory in the construction department and the material factory in the railway department also use this oil as raw material or lubricant. According to the director of the cooperative: "In the past, the vehicle factory and vehicle cooperative used lard to tan leather. Last year, we also supplied them with eight or nine thousand jin of this kind of oil, which saved the country eight or nine thousand jin of lard. This has a certain effect on increasing the supply of lard on the market." The residue left over from oil refining can also be used as fertilizer for agricultural cooperatives, and the fertilizer effect is sometimes better than bean cake. Last year, the cooperative supplied suburban agricultural cooperatives with more than 500,000 jin of residue fertilizer. Some residue can also be used as pig feed.

After seeing such raw materials and such products, I thought there might be some mystery in the refining process. But in reality, their production tools are very simple. In three simple oil refining rooms, each has only a few large stoves and one or two "pressing machines." After the raw materials are cooked in a large pot, they are placed in a specially made sack and pressed on a "pressing machine," which separates the residue from the oil. Then, after refining, it becomes useful oil. The entire oil refining process is done manually. Although the production process is simple, it is quite laborious. The members of this cooperative are using their own hands to diligently turn discarded waste into industrial oil, and diligently creating wealth for the country in inconspicuous posts.

### 从地沟里找油料

    从地沟里找油料
    胡道源
    食堂里的洗碗水，厨房里的刷锅水，人们把它往地沟里倒，都有点嫌脏，谁想到这些脏东西会变成工业原料呢？北京市有一个手工业生产合作社，在去年利用这类脏东西生产了三十二万斤工业用油。
    三十二万斤工业用油，如果用植物油料来生产，按照四平油酒厂李川江所在车间的出油率计算，至少也需要二百多万斤大豆。这些油，如果全部供给肥皂厂，可以制出各种肥皂二万六千多箱。
    我在北京市日用百货生产合作社联合社听到这个情况以后，就到宣武门外去访问了这个社。
    在一个非常偏僻的角落里，找到了这个“北京市废油提炼生产合作社”。一进门，满院子都是汽油桶和大瓦缸。里面装的是油脂公司和糕点铺子的焦黑的“油底子”，食品公司和大饭店里煮肉漂下来的油沫子，还有从屠宰场弄来的变了颜色的羊肠和牛肺。这些东西，大都发出难闻的气味。比较好一点的，是那些乱七八糟的杂有肉皮、鱼刺、鸡骨头、豆腐角的残汤剩菜。社里的同志说：“这是从大饭店、大食堂里弄来的，一般都不要钱，只要放个桶在那里，定期去装运回来就可以了。这些东西，他们也不容易处理；让我们拉回来，对他们的清洁卫生工作也有好处。”现在，北京饭店、同仁医院等单位的食堂，都经常供给他们这些东西。前面院子里，还有一堆像垃圾一样的东西，根本看不出它的原形。社里的同志说：“这是从地沟里掏出来的。”许多企业、机关、学校的地沟，都成为这个生产合作社取得原料的好地方。去年8月，从一个工厂的地沟里一次掏出来的“污泥”，就炼出了一百七十多斤油。
    从地沟里挖炼油原料这桩事，在组织合作社以前，是很少有人去干的。地沟里很脏，夏天臭、冬天冷，下到沟里，往往弄得浑身是臭泥。可是，这个社的社员们没有一个嫌脏，嫌累，一提掏沟，就抢着去。因为他们认为，地沟里有可以利用的东西，不把它挖出来，就浪费了。特别是在最近各个单位开展增产节约运动以后，“油底子”、残汤剩菜少了，他们便把掏地沟作为取得原料的重要来源。
    利用这样一些原料炼出来的油，用处可不小。肥皂厂使用这种油做出了各种肥皂，建筑部门的油灰厂、铁路部门的材料厂，也使用这种油作原料或润滑剂。据这个社的社长说：“车具厂、车具社熟皮子，过去都是用猪油。去年我们也给他们供应了八、九千斤这样的油，结果就为国家节省了八、九千斤猪油。这对增加市场上的猪油供应量是有一定作用的。”炼油剩下的渣子，还可以给农业合作社做肥料，肥效有的比豆饼还大。去年，这个社供给郊区农业合作社的渣子肥料，就有五十多万斤。有些渣子还可以做养猪的饲料。
    看了那样的原料，又见到这样的产品，我想，在提炼过程中也许有些奥妙吧。实际一看，他们的生产工具非常简单。在三间简陋的炼油房里，每间只有几口大锅灶和一、两台“压榨机”。原料在大锅里煮好以后，装在特制的麻包里，放在“压榨机”上一压，就使渣子和油分离了，然后再经提炼，就成了有用的油脂。炼油的全部过程都是手工操作。生产过程虽然简单，但是相当劳累。这个社的社员，就是这样凭着自己的双手，辛勤地把人家扔掉的废物变成工业用油，辛勤地在不为人注意的岗位上不断为国家创造着财富。
