    Science Press Expands Publishing Scope
    Publication of Foreign Scientific Translations Begins to Increase
    (Our Dispatch) In order to implement the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom," and to facilitate academic research and reference, the Science Press will, in the future, in addition to introducing excellent Soviet scientific works, extensively select and translate for publication representative scientific classics from other countries, especially works in basic science and emerging disciplines.
    Among the publications in the most recent two months is the famous 19th-century classic work, Mendel's "Experiments in Plant Hybridization." Since the 20th century, scientists have been debating the genetic laws created by Mendel, especially intensely in the last decade. At last year's International Congress of Genetics, geneticists from the Soviet Union and other countries engaged in fierce debates over this issue. The contents of this book largely concern the central issues of the debate. Also recently published is "Embryology" by the renowned contemporary American embryologist Professor Barth. This book explores the principles of development from a physiological basis, using experimental materials to combine experimental embryology and morphological embryology, linking the development of embryonic structures with their physiological factors. The basic concepts in Chapter 20 of this book, "Sexual Differentiation," are based on Weismann's and Morgan's genetics theories to connect the developmental process. This concerns gene inheritance theory and is also an important issue currently being researched and discussed by China's biological community. "The Comparative Method in Historical Linguistics," one of the important works by the famous French bourgeois linguist Meillet from the first half of the 20th century, and "A Concise History of Mathematics" by American mathematician Professor Struik have also been translated and published. In addition, recently published titles include the German physicist Hund's "Theory of Heat," "Pacific Ocean Area Mammals" co-authored by Carter et al., and the "Barlow's Tables" consisting of square roots, cube roots, and reciprocals of numbers from 1 to 12,500, which is of practical value to scientific research work.
    In the various journals published by the Science Press, such as the specialized "Translation Reports" and "Abstracts" for various disciplines, many works by foreign scientists have been published more widely than before, reporting on academic activities and research results from various countries.

    科学出版社扩大出书范围
    外国科学译著的出版开始增多
    本报讯　为了贯彻百家争鸣的方针，便于学术界研究参考，科学出版社今后在出版外国科学著作方面，除了介绍苏联的优秀科学著作以外，对其他国家的具有代表性的科学名著、特别是基础科学和新兴学科的著作，也将广泛选译出版。
    在最近两个月的出版物中，有十九世纪著名的经典著作孟德尔的“植物杂交的试验”。二十世纪以来，科学家们一直为孟德尔所创造的遗传定律问题讨论不已，尤其是最近十年来争论更为激烈。在去年的国际遗传学会中，苏联和其他国家的遗传学家为了这个问题展开了激烈的论战。本书内容大多是争论的中心问题。最近出版的还有美国当代著名的胚胎学家巴斯教授的“胚胎学”，这本书从生理学基础上探讨发育原理，引用实验材料把实验胚胎学和形态胚胎学合而为一，把胚胎构造的发育和它们的生理学的因素联系起来。这本书第二十章“性的分化”的基本概念是根据魏斯曼、摩尔根的遗传学说来联系发育过程的，这是有关基因的遗传理论，也是我国生物学界正在研究讨论的重要问题之一。二十世纪前半期著名的法国资产阶级语言学家梅耶的重要著作之一“历史语言学中的比较方法”、美国数学家斯特洛伊克教授的“数学简史”也已翻译出版。此外，不久以前出版的还有德国著名物理学家洪德的“热学理论”、美国卡特等合著的“太平洋区域的哺乳类动物”以及对科学研究工作具有实用价值的从一到一万二千五百各数的平方根、立方根和倒数组成的“巴罗表”等。
    在科学出版社出版的多种期刊中，如各学科的专门“译报”和“文摘”，也都较前更加广泛地刊载了许多外国科学家的著作，报道了各国的学术活动和研究成果。
