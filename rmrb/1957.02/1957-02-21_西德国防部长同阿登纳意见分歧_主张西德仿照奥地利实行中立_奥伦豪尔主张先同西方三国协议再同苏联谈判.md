Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 20th: The West German "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin," published in Bonn, carried a statement on February 18th from Defense Minister Strauss saying that he put forward political propositions that directly contradict Adenauer's views. Strauss believes that it is possible for West Germany to follow Austria's example and implement neutralization.

The bulletin said: Parliamentary figures in Bonn consider Strauss's statement to be a "startling political event" because West German Chancellor Adenauer, as recently as February 15th, emphasized at a press conference for foreign reporters that "the Christian Democratic Union clearly opposes neutralization."

The bulletin quoted Strauss's remarks to a reporter from the Christian Democratic Union's official newspaper, "Political Social Correspondence," saying: "Such a situation is entirely possible: although the overall German tendency and security aspirations would go in the direction of belonging to the Western military alliance system, strong political demands could prompt the German people to make a decision based on the Austrian example. The West will not or cannot prevent Germany from making such a decision."

Strauss also said: "No one in the Bonn government advocates that a unified Germany automatically become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." He believes that a unified Germany will be able to make a decision "freely."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 20th: West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer said on February 19th: On the issue of German unification, "The Social Democratic Party will never agree to reach any one-sided agreement with Russia." He advocates reaching an agreement with the three Western powers first, and then negotiating with the Soviet Union.

    西德国防部长同阿登纳意见分歧 
    主张西德仿照奥地利实行中立
    奥伦豪尔主张先同西方三国协议再同苏联谈判
    据新华社柏林20日电　波恩出版的西德“议会政治新闻公报”18日刊载国防部长施特劳斯的谈话说，他提出了和阿登纳的政见正相矛盾的政治主张。施特劳斯认为：西德仿照奥地利的先例实行中立化是可能的。
    这个公报说：波恩议会人士认为施特劳斯的谈话是“惊人的政治事件”，因为西德总理阿登纳就在2月15日还在外国记者招待会上强调说：“基督教民主联盟明确地反对中立化。”
    这个公报引用施特劳斯对基督教民主联盟机关报“政治社会通讯”记者发表的谈话说：“这样的情形是完全可能的：尽管全德的倾向和安全愿望会向隶属于西方军事联盟体系的方向走去，但是强烈的政治要求却有可能促使德国人民就奥地利的榜样作出决定。西方将不会或者不能阻止德国作出这样的决定。”
    施特劳斯还说：“波恩政府里没有人主张统一后的德国自动地成为北大西洋公约的成员国。”他认为，统一后的德国将能够“自由地”作出决定。
    据新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔19日说：在德国统一问题上，“社会民主党决不会同意同俄国达成任何片面的协议”。他主张先同西方三国取得协议，然后才同苏联进行商谈。
