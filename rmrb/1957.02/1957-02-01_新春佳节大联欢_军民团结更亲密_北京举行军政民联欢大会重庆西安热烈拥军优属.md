Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch. Today, Beijing held a Spring Festival joint celebration with over five thousand army, government and people attending, and they happily spent the first night of the lunar new year.

At the joint celebration, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Beijing, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Party and government organs and the people of the whole city, congratulated the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing and the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in Beijing on a happy Spring Festival. He said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing have consistently strictly observed mass discipline and adhered to policies and laws over the past few years, establishing an incomparably deep relationship with the people of the city. The families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in the city have continuously actively responded to the call of the Party and the government over the past few years, and have worked hard with the people of the city to engage in the production and construction of the capital. He also listed examples of the troops stationed in Beijing actively supporting the socialist construction of the capital.

Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu reported on the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen, and after examining the shortcomings in this work, he said that in order to effectively improve the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen, we have instructed all organs in the city to conduct a thorough inspection of this work before the end of February this year. Each district is holding representative meetings of families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers to widely solicit opinions from all sides. Some responsible cadres of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee have also held discussions with the troops stationed in Beijing. During the Spring Festival, the people of the city are conducting extensive contact with the troops stationed in Beijing, families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. By collecting opinions from these many aspects and carefully studying and handling them item by item based on these opinions, we will surely greatly improve our work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen.

Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, on behalf of the troops stationed in Beijing, congratulated those attending the celebration on the new year. He said that our People's Liberation Army, after spending a long period of war, is now also working hard and joyfully in the youth of building a modern revolutionary army, and is striving to defend the socialist construction of our great motherland. Then, Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai said that tonight's celebration is a symbol of our unity and also a symbol of greater progress towards victory and better work. May our Party, government, and army further unite with the people.

The joint celebration was held in the auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The venue was filled with a harmonious atmosphere. Soldiers wearing army, navy, and air force uniforms danced with government cadres and citizens, and played games such as "Hen Laying Eggs" and "Toad Jumping into Water." Families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers wearing big red flowers were welcomed by the people everywhere. In the halls on the first, second, and third floors of the auditorium, clusters of people burst into laughter from time to time.

Leading personnel of Party and government organs, and generals with golden epaulettes also watched the artistic performances with the masses.

Xinhua News Agency Chongqing, 30th dispatch. Extensive and warm activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen have made the mountain city of Chongqing particularly lively before the Spring Festival.

Last night, more than 4,000 people in the city held a comfort meeting to comfort the PLA troops stationed in Chongqing, families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, and Sichuan geological exploration personnel. Representatives of the troops, families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and geological exploration personnel, as well as Soviet experts, all spoke at the meeting. An evening party was held after the meeting.

In recent days, groups of residents and Young Pioneers, beating gongs and drums, have been visiting the homes of families of martyrs and families of servicemen to offer New Year greetings in the streets and alleys of Chongqing. The Dayanggou and Guihua Street offices in the central district and the Chongqing Youth Palace jointly held a Spring Festival army-people get-together on the evening of the 25th, with more than 3,000 people attending. Responsible government cadres and district people's representatives expressed cordial greetings to the local troops, families of martyrs, families of servicemen, and disabled soldiers. The preferential treatment committee members and district people's representatives of various streets in the central district also extensively visited and understood the life and work of more than 2,000 families of martyrs and families of servicemen in the district. The masses in Side Village and Tuqiao Township launched the activity of "Doing Something for Families of Martyrs and Families of Servicemen."

Holding symposiums to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen is something that many agencies and groups in Chongqing have been busy with recently. On the afternoon of the 28th, the Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Mayor and Deputy Mayors of Chongqing invited the leaders of the troops, agencies, and schools stationed in Chongqing to hold a symposium on supporting the army to solicit their opinions on the work of Chongqing. After the meeting, a get-together was held.

Xinhua News Agency Xi'an, 30th dispatch. From the 26th to the 29th, the people of Xi'an widely launched Spring Festival activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen. Seven mayors and deputy mayors of Xi'an also participated in the consolation activities.

Mayor of Xi'an Liu Geng personally visited and comforted Tao Mama, a family member of a martyr in Caojia Lane. This eighty-year-old woman is the mother of martyr Tao Yongli, secretary of martyr Li Dazhao. Before liberation, she was arrested twice for helping her son do underground work. Deputy Mayor Chen Shiyu braved the snow and stepped through the mud to visit and comfort the masses in Pingmin Institute. At a consolation symposium attended by Deputy Mayor Yang Xiaochu, the families of martyrs and soldiers in Shangqiaozikou requested the mayor to help them solve the problem of insufficient feed and suggested collective pig raising instead of separate households to save labor. Yang Xiaochu accepted their opinions.

This year, Xi'an's work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen was simple but thorough. From the 26th, consolation teams and consolation groups were active everywhere in the streets and alleys. They visited the families of martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers and convalescents of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Xi'an from house to house.

In these few days, the people of Xi'an wrote more than 5,000 Spring Festival consolation letters to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Volunteer Army and convalescents. The people of Xi'an also cleaned houses, dismantled and washed bedding, carried water, chopped firewood, and pasted Spring Festival couplets for families of martyrs and soldiers and disabled soldiers. The relevant departments in Xi'an also inspected the work of preferential treatment throughout the city, distributed Spring Festival preferential treatment funds, and reissued preferential treatment certificates.

    张友渔副市长报告了拥军优属工作，并且检查了这一工作存在的缺点之后说，为了切实改进拥军优属工作，我们已经责成全市各机关，在今年2月底以前，对这项工作进行一次彻底的检查。各区正在分别召开烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人和复员军人的代表会议，广泛听取各方面的意见。中共北京市委和市人民委员会的一些负责干部也已经分别同驻京部队进行了座谈。全市人民在春节期间正在同驻京部队，同烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人进行广泛的接触。通过这许多方面搜集意见，并且根据这些意见逐件认真研究处理，必将使我们的拥军优属工作大大提高一步。
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇代表驻京部队向参加联欢的人们恭贺新禧。他说，我们人民解放军在度过了漫长的战争岁月以后，今天也正在现代化革命军队建设的青春里，紧张的无比愉快的进行工作，为保卫我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设而奋斗。接着内务部部长谢觉哉说，今天晚上的联欢，是我们团结一致的象征，也是更大的走向胜利和更加做好工作的象征。愿我们的党、政府、军队同人民进一步团结无间。
  联欢大会在中国人民政治协商会议礼堂举行。会场里充满了乐融融的气氛。穿着陆、海、空军制服的军人和机关干部、市民一起跳舞，一起玩着“母鸡下蛋”、“蛤蟆跳水”等游戏。戴着大红花的烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人到处受到人民的欢迎。礼堂的一、二、三楼大厅里，一簇簇人群，不时爆发出欢笑声。
    党、政机关的领导人员，挂着金色肩章的将军们也和群众一起观看了文艺演出。
    据新华社重庆30日电　广泛热烈的拥军优属活动，使春节前夕的山城重庆显得格外热闹。
    昨晚，全市四千多人举行了慰问大会，慰问解放军驻重庆部队、烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人和四川地质勘探人员。部队、烈属、军属和地质勘探人员代表以及苏联专家都在会上讲了话。会后举行了晚会。
    近日来，在重庆的街头巷尾，一群一群的居民、少先队员，敲着锣鼓，到烈属、军属家里去拜年。市中区大阳沟、桂花街等六个街道办事处和重庆市青年宫，在25日晚上联合举行了有三千多人参加的春节拥军优属联欢晚会。政府负责干部和区人民代表分别向驻地部队、烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人表示亲切的慰问。市中区各街道的优抚委员和区人民代表等，还普遍深入地访问和了解全区两千多户烈属、军属的生活和工作情况。肆德村、土桥乡的群众发起了“为烈属军属做一件事”的活动。
    召开拥军优属座谈会更是最近重庆很多机关团体忙碌的一件事情。28日下午，中共重庆市委书记和重庆市市长、副市长们，邀请解放军驻重庆的部队、机关、学校的负责人举行拥军座谈会，征求他们对重庆地方工作的意见。会后，还举行了联欢。
    据新华社西安30日电　西安市人民从26日到29日，广泛地展开了春节拥军优属活动。西安市的七位市长和副市长也参加了慰问活动。
    西安市市长刘庚亲自到曹家巷慰问了烈属陶妈妈。这位八十岁的老人，是李大钊烈士的秘书长陶永立烈士的母亲，解放前她因帮助儿子做地下工作曾两次被捕。副市长陈式玉冒着雪、踏着泥泞和群众一起到平民所去慰问。上桥梓口的烈军属们在副市长杨晓初参加的慰问座谈会上，曾要求市长帮助他们解决饲料不足等问题，并且建议集体养猪，不要一家一户的分开养，以节省劳力。杨晓初接受了他们的意见。
    今年西安市的拥军优属工作做得简朴而深入。从26日起，大街小巷到处都活跃着慰问队和慰问组。他们挨家逐户地慰问了烈军属、残废军人、复员军人和驻在西安的中国人民解放军休养员。
    在这几天里，西安人民给中国人民解放军、志愿军和休养员写了五千多封春节慰问信。西安人民还给烈军属、残废军人打扫房子、拆洗被褥、担水、劈柴、贴对联。西安市有关部门也在全市范围内检查了优抚工作，发放了春节优抚金，换发了优待证。
