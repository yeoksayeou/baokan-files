Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Yi reported): The advantages of advanced cooperatives have moved the hearts of primary cooperative members and individual farmers. From last autumn to the present, nearly a thousand primary cooperatives in Shanxi have been transformed into advanced cooperatives, and more than fifteen thousand individual farmers have joined advanced cooperatives. Now, the number of advanced cooperatives in Shanxi Province has increased from 97% during the peak of the cooperative movement last spring to 99%. Only more than five thousand individual households remain in the province. The agricultural cooperatives in Changzhi and Yuci districts have all been upgraded to advanced cooperatives. Most of the more than nine thousand individual farmers in the Jinan district have also joined advanced cooperatives. Now, there are very few individual farmers in many areas.

In the past year, primary cooperatives and individual households have clearly seen the superior role of advanced cooperatives. For example, they have carried out large-scale water conservancy, soil and water conservation, manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaigns, and changed farming systems and techniques. In particular, they have tenaciously fought against natural disasters. These significant achievements they have witnessed have further promoted the determination of these farmers to join advanced cooperatives. Li Yuqi and three other individual farmers in Beidong Township, Quwo County, had greater ideological concerns last year. However, in the same circumstances last year, the agricultural cooperatives had a bumper harvest, while they themselves suffered a reduction in production and suffered from waiting and seeing. This year, they have applied to join the cooperative repeatedly, expressing that they will no longer farm individually under any circumstances.

    高级社的好处打动了山西一万多户单干农民的心
    新华社太原4日电　新华社记者杨义报道：高级社的好处打动了初级社社员和个体农民的心，山西各地从去年秋季到目前止，有近千个初级社转办起高级社，一万五千多个体农户分别加入了高级社。现在，山西省高级社已由去年春季合作化大发展高潮时的97％强发展到99％，全省个体农户仅留有五千多户。长治、榆次两个专区的农业社，已经全部升为高级社。晋南专区的九千多个个体农户也大部加入了高级社。现在，许多地区已经很少有个体农户了。
    各地初级社和个体户在去年一年中，曾经清楚地看到了高级社的优越作用，例如，开展了大规模的兴修水利、水土保持、积肥造肥运动和改变耕作制度、耕作技术等，特别是顽强地和自然灾害斗争。他们亲眼看到的这些重大成就，更促进了这些农户参加高级社的决心。曲沃县北董乡李玉棋等四户个体农民，去年思想顾虑较大，但去年一年间在同样情况下，农业社丰收了，自己却减了产，吃了观望的亏。今年三番五次申请入社，表示无论如何不再单干了。
