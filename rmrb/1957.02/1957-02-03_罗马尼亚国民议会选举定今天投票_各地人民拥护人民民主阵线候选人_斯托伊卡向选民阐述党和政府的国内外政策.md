Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 2nd: The elections for the Romanian National Assembly will take place tomorrow throughout the country.

Recently, the election campaign has generated an unprecedented upsurge in Romanian cities and villages. Workers and farmers have actively participated in the election campaign, and people from other strata of society have also taken action.

In the 437 constituencies across the country, more than ten million voters have met with the 437 candidates of the People's Democratic Front. In addition, countless voters have held individual talks with the candidates. During their meetings with the candidates, they discussed various issues related to the country's domestic and foreign policies. The entire election campaign process has shown that voters have expressed full support for the candidates of the People's Democratic Front, and no one has raised any dissenting opinions regarding the nomination of any candidate.

During the election campaign, the ties between the working people and the Workers' Party and the government have become even closer. During this period, leaders of the Party and the government have visited various parts of the country to meet with the masses. They have participated in mass rallies and visited factories and collective farms. At various gatherings during the election campaign, voters compared their current happy lives with the painful days before liberation. Whenever they talked about the current prosperity of the country and their own good lives, they expressed their gratitude for the leadership of the Party and the government, and for the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. While criticizing shortcomings in their work and raising difficulties, demands, and suggestions, people expressed their willingness to work with the Party and the government to overcome difficulties and realize their aspirations. Voters wholeheartedly support the policies of the Party and the government and firmly believe that the resolutions of the Central Committee's plenary session in December last year will bring greater happiness to the country and the people. They have expressed their determination to greet the general election with practical actions in their production and work posts.

Voters are also very concerned about the international situation. At meetings, they condemn the imperialists' conspiracies against the people's democratic countries. They firmly stated, "We want socialism, we want peace, we don't want landlords, we don't want capitalists."

The election campaign for the Romanian National Assembly is led by the People's Democratic Front, headed by the Workers' Party. After the start of the campaign, the People's Democratic Front issued a manifesto, and the various mass organizations participating in the Front also issued appeals, calling on voters to elect the candidates of the People's Democratic Front. Various organizations have selected their outstanding members to conduct in-depth and extensive propaganda work among the voters.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, February 2nd: The "August 23rd" constituency in Bucharest held a grand rally on the afternoon of January 31st, at which voters met Stoica, the candidate of the People's Democratic Front for the National Assembly and Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers.

Stoica spoke at the rally. He began by saying that this election campaign is being carried out in a situation where the people's political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm are even higher. The working people have more forcefully than ever expressed their unwavering confidence in the people's democratic regime and their determination to implement the domestic and foreign policies of the Workers' Party and the government.

Stoica said that the Party's policy of socialist industrialization has proven to be correct and in line with the fundamental interests of the country and the people. We now have a strong heavy industry and a strong material foundation for using oil, natural gas and other natural resources to benefit the people. By the end of 1956, Romania's industrial output had increased to more than three times that of 1938. The electricity produced in one year in 1938 can now be produced in just three months; while iron ore only takes eighty-four days, and steel takes only three months. Compared with 1938, in 1956, electricity production increased by 4.2 times, coal production increased by 2.3 times, and pig iron production increased by 4.3 times. Now, the oil industry can produce 11 million tons of crude oil annually.

Stoica said that one of the major achievements of our people's democratic regime is the establishment of our own machine manufacturing industry. In 1955, the output of the machine manufacturing industry increased fourfold compared with 1949. Now, we can not only almost entirely meet domestic needs for machinery and equipment, but also export more and more machinery and industrial equipment. All of this proves the profound changes that have taken place in our country's economy, changes that have transformed Romania from a backward agricultural country into a continuously developing industrial-agricultural country.

While heavy industry has developed greatly, the consumer goods industry has also developed. Today, Romania produces three times more textiles than in 1938, and five times more meat products and canned foods.

In agriculture, in the years since the establishment of the people's regime, the total grain output has exceeded pre-war output.

Stoica said that while reviewing the achievements that have been made, our Party also openly explains to the working people that there are still many difficulties and shortcomings, and the living standards have not improved to the expected level. Stoica said that it is of particularly great significance to implement the Party and government's policy of systematically improving the people's living conditions, and it is necessary to strive to implement the various decisions adopted at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party in December last year.

When talking about the international situation, Stoica said that recently, Western imperialists have stepped up their aggressive actions, which have worsened the international situation. But the strength of the people who yearn for peace around the world is growing stronger. The unity of the working people's struggle in the international arena is developing and consolidating. The most powerful force for defending peace is the unity of socialist countries. The bilateral and multilateral talks held recently by delegations from fraternal countries have shown that socialist countries are fully united and fraternally support each other. The Romanian people know that the most reliable guarantee for their future is friendship and fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

Stoica finally said that the program that the People's Democratic Front has proposed to voters is a program for building socialism and advocating peace. The election of members of the National Assembly will further strengthen the unity of the Party, the government, and the people, and prove that the working people are determined to contribute all their strength to building a socialist society.

    罗马尼亚国民议会选举定今天投票
    各地人民拥护人民民主阵线候选人
    斯托伊卡向选民阐述党和政府的国内外政策
    新华社布加勒斯特2日电　罗马尼亚国民议会的选举，明天就要在全国各地投票了。
    最近时期，选举运动在罗马尼亚的城市和乡村中形成空前的热潮。工人、农民积极参加了选举运动，其他阶层的群众也都行动起来。
    在全国的四百三十七个选区中，有一千万以上的选民同人民民主阵线的四百三十七个候选人会见。另外还有无数的选民同候选人进行了个别谈话。他们在同候选人会见时，讨论了有关国家对内、对外政策的各种各样的问题。整个选举运动的进程表明，选民们对人民民主阵线的候选人表示了完全的拥护，没有人对任何一个候选人的提名提出过不同的意见。
    在选举运动中，劳动人民同工人党和政府的联系更加密切了。在这一段日子里，党和政府的领导人分别到全国各地同群众见面，他们参加了群众大会，到工厂、集体农庄访问。选民们在选举运动的各种集会上都把现在的幸福生活和解放以前的痛苦日子作了对比。每当谈到现在国家的富强和自己的美好生活时，他们表示感谢党和政府的领导，感谢苏联对他们的无私帮助。在批评工作中的缺点，提出困难、要求和建议的时候，人们表示要和党、政府一道克服困难和实现自己的愿望。选民们衷心支持党和政府的政策，深信党中央去年12月全会的决议将给国家和人民带来更大的幸福。他们纷纷表示要在生产和工作岗位上以实际行动来迎接这次大选。
    选民们也很关心国际局势。他们在会议上谴责帝国主义者对人民民主国家的阴谋，他们坚决表示“要社会主义，要和平，不要地主，不要资本家”。
    罗马尼亚国民议会的选举运动，是由以工人党为首的人民民主阵线领导的。运动开始以后，人民民主阵线发表了宣言，参加阵线的各个群众组织也发出了号召，号召选民选举人民民主阵线的候选人。各个组织都选出了自己的优秀分子，深入和广泛地向选民们进行宣传工作。
    新华社布加勒斯特2日电　布加勒斯特“8月23日”选区在1月31日下午举行了一次盛大的集会，会上，选民们会见了人民民主阵线的国民议会议员候选人、罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡。
    斯托伊卡在这次集会上讲了话。他首先说，这一次选举运动是在人民群众政治积极性和劳动热情更加高涨的情况下展开的。劳动人民比任何时候都更加有力地表达了他们对人民民主政权的不可动摇的信心，表达了他们实现工人党和政府的对内、对外政策的决心。
    斯托伊卡说，党的社会主义工业化的政策已经证明是正确的，是符合国家和人民的根本利益的。我们现在有了强大的重工业，有了利用石油、天然气和其他天然财富来为人民谋福利的强大的物质基础。到1956年年底，罗马尼亚的工业产量已经增加为1938年的三倍以上。1938年一年所生产的电力，现在只需要三个月的时间就可以生产出来；而铁矿砂只要八十四天，钢只要三个月。同1938年比较，1956年电力的产量增加了四点二倍，煤产量增加了二点三倍，生铁产量增加了四点三倍。现在，石油工业一年可以出产一千一百万吨原油。
    斯托伊卡说，我们人民民主政权的重大成就之一，就是创立了自己的机器制造工业。1955年机器制造工业的产量比1949年增加了四倍。现在，我们不仅几乎能够全部满足国内对机器和设备的需要，而且还能出口愈来愈多的机器和工业设备。所有这一切都证明了我国经济中所发生的深刻变化，这些变化把罗马尼亚从落后的农业国变成了不断发展的工业—农业国。
    在重工业大大发展的同时，消费品工业也有了发展。今天罗马尼亚所生产的纺织品比1938年增加了三倍，肉制品和罐头食品增加了五倍。
    在农业方面，在人民政权成立以来的几年中，谷物总产量已经超过战前的产量。
    斯托伊卡说，我们党在回顾已经取得的成就的同时，也公开向劳动人民说明现在仍旧存在着许多困难和缺点，生活水平没有提高到预计的水平。斯托伊卡说，对于党和政府有计划地改善人民生活条件的政策的实现是有特别重大意义的，是要努力执行罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会去年12月全体会议上所通过的各项决定。
    斯托伊卡谈到国际形势时说，最近，西方帝国主义者加紧了他们的侵略行动，使国际形势恶化了。但是全世界渴望和平的人民的力量日益加强。劳动人民的斗争在国际方面的团结日益发展巩固。保卫和平的最强大的力量是社会主义国家的团结。最近兄弟国家的党和政府代表团先后举行的双边和多边会谈，表明社会主义国家是充分团结和兄弟般地相互支持的。罗马尼亚人民知道，他们的将来的最可靠的保证是同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友谊和兄弟联盟。
    斯托伊卡最后说，人民民主阵线向选民提出来的纲领是建设社会主义、主张和平的纲领。国民议会议员的选举将更加加强党、政府和人民的团结，并且证明，劳动人民决心以全部力量贡献给建设社会主义社会。
