Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Today, in the Capital Theater, relatives of Beijing students studying in the United States gathered with students who returned from the US last year and students who returned from other capitalist countries to celebrate the Lunar New Year's Eve.

    The relatives of students studying in the US who participated in the gathering all hoped that their loved ones would break through the obstruction of the US government and return to the motherland and reunite with their families as soon as possible. Many family members gathered around the returned students to inquire about the situation of their relatives abroad. Zhang Qingyun, an elementary school teacher, had not heard from her younger brother in the United States for seven years. Coincidentally, she learned her brother's address from Gao Lianpei, a returned student with a doctorate in physics, which made her very happy. She is prepared to write to her relatives and ask him to return to the motherland as soon as possible.

    Jin Yongzuo, who recently returned from the United States, said excitedly at the gathering that the students studying in the United States are the same; they also miss you very much.

    Mao Yisheng, chairman of the Beijing Association of Relatives of Students Studying in the United States, wished the relatives of students studying in the United States a happy Spring Festival. He said: Today is a day for Chinese reunion. May your loved ones return to the country and reunite with you as soon as possible.

    北京留美学生家属  盼同亲人早日团聚
    据新华社30日讯　今天，北京市留美学生家属在首都剧场和去年回国的留美学生以及从其他资本主义国家归国的留学生欢聚一堂，共度旧历年的除夕。
    参加联欢的留美学生家属，都盼望着自己的亲人冲破美国政府的阻挠，早日回到祖国和家人团聚。许多家属都围着归国留学生打听亲人在国外的情况。小学教员张青云和在美国的弟弟不通音信已七年了，可巧，她从归国留学生物理学博士高联佩那里得知了她弟弟的地址，她非常高兴。他准备写信给亲人，让他早日回到祖国。
    新近从美国回来的金永祚在联欢会上激动地说，在美国的留学生也是一样，他们也很想念你们。
    北京市留美学生家属联谊会会长茅以升向留美学生家属祝贺春节快乐，他说：今天是中国团圆的日子，愿你们的亲人早日回国和你们团聚。
