　　"Guests, come and stay at our inn. We have tea and water available, and the food and lodging are economical." Every time a ship docks at the Han River shipping wharf, inn worker Jiang Daji is there to greet them, welcoming batches of travelers to the inn so they can have a good rest.

　　Jiang Daji is in his fifties this year and has been working in the hotel industry for thirty-seven years. After the joint state-private ownership of the Tiansheng Inn in Yuekou Town, Hubei Province, he realized that he was also a master of the enterprise, and he became even more motivated in his work. Every time a ship is about to dock an hour in advance, he and the other workers prepare tea, water, and bedding properly. As soon as the travelers arrive, tea is served immediately; after washing off the dust of the road, the travelers can rest on the soft beds.

　　Based on his long years of service experience, he understands the psychology of travelers very well. For example, when the weather is hot, he moves the travelers' beds one by one to the open ground; after it cools down in the middle of the night, he moves these beds back indoors. He doesn't let the travelers get hot, nor does he let them catch a cold. In May of last year, a guest named Zhou Qianshun who was staying at the inn had to go to Qianjiang County to work. When he was about to leave, a strong wind suddenly blew up, and the weather was very cold. Jiang Daji lent the guest his own cotton coat. Later, when this guest came to return the cotton coat, he said to him with great gratitude: "You are a good host, and your cotton coat helped me complete my work task!"

　　People who take ships late at night are always worried about missing the ship and can't sleep well. After Jiang Daji checks the travelers in, he finds out the time they need to board the ship so they can sleep soundly. An hour before the ship departs, he gently wakes up the travelers who are leaving to wash their faces, drink tea, and prepare to board the ship. Guests who have stayed here can sleep well and have never missed a ship.

　　Because Jiang Daji and the other comrades at the inn receive travelers so diligently, the travelers have a good impression of the inn. Looking through the opinion book, among the hundred or so opinions, except for two or three suggestions for improving the equipment, the rest are words of praise. (Ji Tao, Mang Ping)

### 体贴旅客的客栈工人

    体贴旅客的客栈工人
    “客人们，到我们店里住下吧，茶水方便，食宿经济。”每当轮船一靠汉江航运码头，客栈工人蒋大吉就在那里招呼着，把要投宿的旅客一批批地迎接到店里，让他们好好地休息。
    蒋大吉今年五十多岁了，在旅店当工人已经有三十七年的历史。在湖北省岳口镇天生客栈公私合营以后，他认识到自己也是企业的主人了，工作更有了劲头。每当轮船停泊前一个钟头，他就和其他工人一起把茶水、床铺准备得妥妥贴贴。旅客一落店，茶水马上就端上来；洗涤风尘以后，旅客们就可以倒在轻软的客床上休息了。
    凭着他长期的服务经验，他很懂得旅客的心理。例如，天气热的时候，他就把旅客的床铺一个个地搬到敞地上；午夜转凉之后，他又把这些床铺移到屋内。不让旅客受热，也不让旅客着凉。去年5月间，有个住店的客人周谦顺要到潜江县去工作，临行时突然刮起大风，天气很冷。蒋大吉就把自己的棉衣让客人穿去。后来这个客人来还棉衣的时候，极为感谢地对他说：“你是个好主人，你的棉衣帮助我完成了工作任务！”
    深夜搭轮船的人，总耽心误点，觉也睡不好。蒋大吉在旅客一住店以后，就把他们乘船的时间打听清楚，让他们放心睡觉。到开船前一个钟头，他就轻轻叫醒要走的旅客起来洗脸、喝茶，准备上船。住过这里的客人都能睡好觉，也没有漏过船。
    因为蒋大吉和客栈的其他同志如此殷勤地接待旅客，旅客们对这个客栈也都有好感。翻开意见簿，一百多条意见中，除了两三条建议改进设备的意见以外，其余都是赞扬的话语。　（季涛、蟒平）
