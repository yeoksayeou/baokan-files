    On the Collection of Historical Materials on Imperialist Economic Aggression Against China	Xie Juzeng
    Mr. Zhu Qi published an article in the People's Daily on August 29th last year entitled "The History of Imperialist Economic Aggression Against China Should Be Studied," arguing that historical materials on imperialist economic aggression against China should be collected, sorted, compiled, and published in a timely manner to lay the foundation for the study of modern Chinese economic history, and so on. I agree with Mr. Zhu Qi's opinion and would also like to add some of my own.
    As everyone knows, foreign banks were the vanguard of imperialist economic aggression against us, but we still don't know which foreign bank appeared in China first. Mr. Zhu Qi said that the earliest established was the British HSBC, but in fact, the British Mercantile Bank established branches in China many years earlier than HSBC. According to some books, a British bank opened a branch in Shanghai from Hong Kong as early as 1848, but closed down in 1892 due to business losses. However, the name of this bank has never been clarified. Some say it was the Oriental Bank Corporation (as per the Japanese "East Asia Research Institute" data), some say it was the Far East Bank (as per the "Fifty Years of China's Economy" published by the Bank of Communications), and some say it was the Oriental Bank (as per the 1937 pseudo-"Shanghai Yearbook"). Later, after consulting old books, I found in the diary of Xu Run, the former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, that the first bank in Shanghai was named Liru Bank, founded in the nineteenth year of Daoguang (1839), and so on. In the "Complete Works of Zuo Wenxianggong," there are also memorials involving borrowing foreign loans from Liru Bank. Recently, after reading Xu Yisheng's "Qing Government's Foreign Debt Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895," the article mentioned that both Chonghou and Zuo Zongtang had borrowed foreign debt from this bank. Therefore, Liru Bank was undoubtedly the first foreign bank to open in China. However, the problem is that this is only about a hundred years ago, and it is already confusing, which makes one imagine how much more difficult it is for other matters.
    Mr. Zhu Qi's article mentioned the direct circulation of foreign currencies in various trading ports in China, but mainly referred to foreign silver dollars, the Japanese "Old Man's Notes" in Northeast China during the Beiyang warlord era, and the US dollar in the Kuomintang-controlled areas after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In fact, the wealth that foreign banks in China plundered from our people through the abuse of issuing banknotes was many times greater than directly using foreign coins and foreign currency. However, exactly how many banknotes did foreign banks issue in China? We have not yet come up with a clear figure. Although general books and periodicals occasionally mention it, they are mostly based on Japanese survey data, which is passed down indirectly. These data often come from the banks' published full-bank business reports, in which the issuance figures include those issued in the colonies, so it is impossible to know the exact number issued in China. After the "May Fourth" Movement, due to the upsurge of anti-imperialist sentiment among the broad masses of our people and the decline of foreign bank credit, foreign bank banknotes often experienced runs, and the circulation in the market decreased day by day. However, the fact that foreign bank banknotes no longer circulate in the market later does not necessarily mean that they have been fully recovered. Because, over the decades, natural disasters and man-made calamities have been continuous, and a portion of these banknotes in circulation must have been damaged every year. Over time, this small amount accumulates into a large amount, which is definitely astonishing and becomes a huge invisible source of wealth for foreign banks. Therefore, how to collect relevant historical materials in this area to clarify the entire process of foreign banks issuing banknotes in our country is an important topic for studying the history of imperialist economic aggression against us.
    Mr. Zhu Qi's article did not mention foreign insurance companies, but in fact, they were also forerunners of imperialist economic aggression against China, and they established branches in our country earlier than foreign banks. As early as 1835, the Union Insurance Society of Canton (with the Shanghai branch named as the Canton Insurance Office), which focused on Guangzhou and Shanghai for business development, established its headquarters in Macau. The following year, it established the Canton Insurance Society (now renamed as Union Insurance) in Hong Kong. At the same time, the British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire in Shanghai acted as agents for foreign insurance companies from the very beginning. By 1846, the British Union Insurance Society and the Great Eastern Insurance Company had also established branches in Shanghai. Just look at the cover of the first issue of the 1850 "North China Herald" to find many advertisements from Shanghai agencies of foreign insurance companies soliciting business, including life insurance, marine insurance, and fire insurance. At that time, it is said that there was already one foreign bank in Shanghai, but it was still unknown. This shows that foreign insurance companies were qualified in China earlier than foreign banks. In the last twenty years or so before liberation, Chinese-owned insurance companies sprung up, and on the surface, it seemed that they had recovered many rights and interests from foreign companies and blocked a large leak, but in fact, many domestic companies were limited by their financial resources. Each business only retained a very small limit, and the vast majority was still reinsured with foreign companies. Therefore, in essence, domestic companies were still agents of foreign companies. Someone estimated that the insurance premiums plundered from China by foreign insurance companies amounted to 2.4 million pounds sterling per year. Therefore, the study of the history of imperialist economic aggression against us must not ignore the information about foreign insurance companies.
    Secondly, we must also focus on collecting information on imperialist monopoly of China's industrial securities market. As early as 1891, foreigners established the "Shanghai Stock Exchange" in Shanghai to engage in stock trading. In 1905, the organization was further expanded and the "Shanghai Stockbrokers' Association" was established. From then until the eve of the Pacific War, China's entire industrial securities market was always under their control. They tried their best to use this institution to suck the blood of the Chinese people. Many people always think that imperialist economic aggression against us always comes with huge capital, but the opposite is true. Many of them rely solely on the Chinese people's money to plunder the Chinese people's wealth, and the Shanghai Stockbrokers' Association is their main weapon in this regard. For example, US monopoly capital once bought the Shanghai Municipal Council Electric Department and the Shanghai Hua Yang Telegraph Company in the old Shanghai International Settlement, and reorganized them into the Shanghai Power Company and the Shanghai Telephone Company, respectively. On the surface, it seemed that they had taken out a huge sum of money, but in fact, the Shanghai Power Company subsequently issued 88 million silver dollar bonds and 22 million Shanghai taels of 6% preference shares through the Shanghai Stockbrokers' Association; the Shanghai Telephone Company also issued 5 million Shanghai taels of 6% bonds and 14 million silver dollar bonds through the Shanghai Stockbrokers' Association. A large part of this was squeezed from the Chinese people. In addition to leaving some as operating funds, the rest was remitted to their home countries. If we can find ways to collect, combine, research, and analyze the archives of the Shanghai Stockbrokers' Association and its famous foreign brokers, as well as the annual business reports of the relevant foreign-owned enterprises, we will definitely achieve significant gains.
    To study the history of imperialist economic aggression against China, the "North China Daily News" published by the British in Shanghai is a good reference. The newspaper was first published in the form of a weekly (i.e., the North China Herald) on August 3, 1850, and began to be published as a daily in 1864, until December 9, 1941, when the Japanese army invaded the area south of the Suzhou Creek, and the premises were occupied and the publication was suspended. After Japan surrendered, it resumed publication on October 8, 1945, and ended shortly after the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea. Its entire content is a true record of imperialism's rampage in China and its various economic plunders over the past century. The newspaper itself also has a valuable archive, including important political events in China over the past century and various activities of imperialism in China. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the premises of the newspaper were occupied by the Mainland Daily News run by the Japanese, and the above-mentioned archives were all moved away by the Japanese without a trace. It was not until after Japan surrendered that it was found in the house of Jardine Matheson & Co. at No. 27, East Zhongshan Road, Shanghai. It is possible that the Japanese originally intended to transport this archive to Tokyo. These things were later taken back by the "North China Daily News." The newspaper has been closed for six years, and it seems necessary to find out the whereabouts of this archive.
    The "North China Daily News" also published a "Directory of Foreign Firms," which was published annually from the first volume in 1865 until 1941, without interruption. Although the contents of the book mainly record the general situation of foreign-owned enterprises in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou, the names and titles of foreign personnel, and the names of compradores, etc., valuable research data can also be unearthed from it.
    As for the archival materials left by foreign banks in China, they have always been neglected. For example, the German Bank of China closed down once during World War I, and the premises were confiscated by the Beiyang warlord government, and its archival materials may not have been preserved by anyone; also, banks such as the Russo-Asiatic Bank and the Banque Franco-Chinoise went bankrupt and closed down successively, and China was responsible for the liquidation on their behalf, but after all the documents and archives were liquidated, it is feared that no one would take care of them and they would be lost. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionary regime took over all the archives and account books of all Japanese banks in China, of which there were more than 300 boxes belonging to the Yokohama Specie Bank, but because most of them were the annual account books of the branches in China, and their era dated back to the middle of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, they were considered to have lost their timeliness and were of no value. It is not known where they are now. In fact, their account books, like the account books of landlords, are valuable materials for studying modern Chinese economic history and should not be destroyed casually.
    It should be pointed out that Shanghai was the main base for imperialism to carry out economic aggression against China. Their important enterprises and commercial institutions took root in Shanghai. The written records, books of accounts, and annual reports submitted to shareholders' meetings, etc., are all valuable materials for studying the situation of imperialist economic aggression against China. Unfortunately, since 1941, due to the Japanese imperialists' occupation of all enterprises and institutions operated by foreign merchants and the detention of their principals in concentration camps, the archives, documents, and account books they left behind were arbitrarily moved away or allowed to be lost. When the Anti-Japanese War was won and Japan surrendered, all Japanese enterprises and commercial institutions in China were immediately taken over by the Kuomintang reactionary regime, and all their documents and archives suffered the same fate. Before and after liberation, European and American merchants in China were eager to end their business and return to their home countries, and those cumbersome documents and books could not be taken away, so they had to be discarded or sold as waste paper. It is conceivable that in these ten years or so, many valuable historical materials have been lost and destroyed.
    In addition, many historical materials related to imperialist economic exploitation of us still exist in the hands of our own commercial groups or enterprises. For example, the Shanghai Henan North Road Money Exchange Guild Hall used to have a plaque hanging on it, recording the process of a case decades ago in which foreign banks relied on their power to force money shops to return remittances collected on their behalf. Later, the guild hall was used for other purposes, and the plaques were all taken down and, it is said, destroyed. Because the money shops did not have archives in the early years, they originally wanted to erect plaques to preserve the record for a long time, but now they have disappeared along with the plaques and cannot be found. For example, in the past, cotton cloth merchants in Shanghai and Tianjin specially ordered foreign cloth from abroad. Because China used silver and foreign countries used gold, foreign banks were able to collude with foreign firms to manipulate exchange rates and do whatever they wanted. At the time of ordering, they first ordered a lengthening (i.e., the exchange rate fell) to lure Chinese merchants into their trap. Once the goods arrived, they would shorten the forward exchange rate (i.e., the exchange rate rose), often causing the orderers to go bankrupt. In the period from 1904 to 1905, and more recently in 1921, many Tianjin and Shanghai foreign cloth merchants went bankrupt and closed down due to the expiration of orders, the soaring exchange rate, and the inability to settle prices, resulting in huge losses. Among them, Tianjin merchants lost as much as 500,000 pounds sterling in 1921 when they ordered 20 million taels of goods. The Tianjin and Shanghai Chambers of Commerce and foreign cloth industry associations at the time must have detailed files of the entire process of such ordering disputes. If they still exist today, they are also valuable historical materials.
    In recent years, all aspects of the protection and excavation of historical relics have been meticulous. We often see Shang and Zhou bronzes found in scrap metal and good copies of Ming and Qing books picked out from waste paper and old books; we also often hear of famous people's relics found in deserted villages and ruins or Taiping Heavenly Kingdom historical materials obtained in dilapidated temples, and so on, which are really exciting; but we rarely hear of valuable historical materials related to imperialist economic aggression against China being found in piles of old paper or from old goods stalls. This does not mean that such things do not exist, but reflects that everyone has not paid attention to this issue. Taking Shanghai as an example, in recent years, it is not known how many foreign books, account books, and documents have been collected from all directions by old goods stalls. Some directly become papermaking raw materials for paper mills, some are supplied to vendors for wrapping goods, and some are transferred to old bookstores or old goods stalls for sale by the catty, and finally all disappear. If we can closely contact the relevant departments and ask research institutions to carefully review these things that are regularly collected before they are processed, we may be able to unearth many valuable historical materials at any time. These opportunities are disappearing day by day, and it is hoped that the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other research institutions will catch up and give them the attention they deserve.

    谈谈帝国主义对中国经济侵略的史料搜集问题	谢菊曾
    朱契先生在去年8月29日的人民日报上发表了“应该研究帝国主义对中国经济侵略的历史”一文，认为应该及时把帝国主义对中国经济侵略的史料加以搜集、整理、编纂和印行，为研究中国近代经济史打下基础，云云。我同意朱契先生的意见，同时也想补充一点儿意见。
    大家知道，外国银行是帝国主义对我经济侵略的先锋，可是中国境内第一家出现的外国银行究竟是哪家，我们到今天还搞不清楚。朱契先生说最早设立的是英国的汇丰银行，事实上英国的麦加利银行在我国设立分行比汇丰要早好多年。另据若干书上记载，则知在麦加利银行之前，远在1848年就有一家英商银行从香港分设来上海，后来至1892年因营业亏折停业。但这家银行的名称，始终没有弄清楚。有的说是东方银公司（如日本人的“东亚研究所”资料），有的说是远东银行（如中国通商银行出版的“五十年来之中国经济”），有的说是东方银行（如1937年伪“上海市年鉴”）。以后，我查考旧书，发现在前招商局总办徐润的日记里记有上海第一家银行，其名为丽如银行，成立于道光十九年（1839），云云。在“左文襄公全集”里，也有涉及向丽如银行举借洋款的奏稿。最近，读徐义生的“甲午战争前清政府的外债”一文，文中提到崇厚、左宗棠都曾向这家银行借过外债。可见，丽如银行是第一家在中国开设的外国银行无疑。但是，问题在于，这不过是百年左右的事，已经纠缠不清，其他可想而知了。
    朱契先生文中说到外国货币直接在中国各贸易口岸流通情形，但主要是指外国银元、北洋军阀时代东北的日本“老头票”和抗战胜利以后蒋管区的美钞而言。事实上，过去在华的外国银行，通过滥发纸币所掠夺的我国人民的财富，比起直接行使外国硬币和外钞来，更不知要多出若干倍。但是，到底外国银行在中国发行过多少钞票呢？我们直到现在为止还没有得出一个明确的数字。一般书刊上虽偶有提到，但大都是根据日本人的调查资料，辗转传述。这些资料又往往来自各银行公布的全行营业报告，其中发行数字是包括其在殖民地所发行的在内，因此，无法知道在中国发行的确数。“五四”运动以后，由于我国广大人民反帝情绪的高涨和外国银行信用的衰落，外国银行钞票时常发生挤兑，市上流通日少一日。但是，外国银行钞票后来虽然不再在市面流通，并不足说明已被全数收回。因为，几十年间，天灾人祸连绵不断，这些流通在外的钞票每年必有一部分遭到毁损，经年累月，积少成多，其数定堪惊人，成了外国银行的一笔看不见的巨大财源。所以如何搜集这方面的有关史料，明确外国银行在我国发行钞票的前后经过，是研究帝国主义对我经济侵略的历史的一个重要课题。
    朱契先生文中未提到外国保险公司，实则它们同样是帝国主义对中国经济侵略的前驱者，而且在我国设立分支机构的时间比外国银行更早。远在1835年，一家以广州、上海为业务发展对象的於仁保险公司（上海行名称做保安）即在澳门成立了总公司，次年又在香港创办了一家广东保险公司（现在名称改为隆德），同时上海的英商怡和洋行和太古洋行一开始就兼任外国保险公司的代理人。到了1846年英商永福和大东方两保险公司又在上海设立了分公司。只要看看1850年第一期“华北捷报”的封面，就可发现许多外国保险公司的上海代理店招徕生意的广告，其中寿险、水险以及火险应有尽有。而当时上海外商银行据说已经有了一家，但尚默默无闻。这就说明，外国保险公司在中国的资格比外国银行更老。在解放以前的最后二十多年中，中国人自己创办的保险公司风起云涌，表面上似乎从外国公司手中挽回了不少利权，堵塞了很大漏巵，实则许多本国公司限于资力，每笔生意自己只保留很小的限额，绝大部分仍分保与外国公司，因此骨子里本国公司仍然是外国公司的代理人。有人估计，外国保险公司从中国掠夺去的保费每年要达英金二百四十万镑之巨。所以要研究帝国主义对我经济侵略的历史，决不能忽视有关外国保险公司方面的资料。
    其次，我们还须着重搜集帝国主义垄断中国产业证券市场方面的资料。早在1891年，外人即在上海设立“上海股份公所”，从事股票卖买，至1905年进一步扩大组织，成立了“众业公所”，从此直到太平洋战事爆发前夕为止，中国整个产业证券市场始终处在它们的控制之下。它们尽量利用这个机构，吮吸中国人民的血液。好些人总以为，帝国主义对我经济侵略，总是挟着雄厚的资本而来，但事实恰恰相反，他们不少是专靠中国人民的钱来掠夺中国人民的财富的，而众业公所正是他们在这方面的主要武器。例如美国垄断资本过去收买上海旧公共租界工部局电气处和上海华洋德律风公司，分别改组为上海电力公司和上海电话公司。表面上似乎曾拿出过一笔巨款，实际上，上海电力公司事后即通过众业公所发行了五厘银元债券八千八百万元和六厘优先股票上海规银二千二百万两；上海电话公司事后也同样通过众业公所发行了六厘债券上海规银五百万两和银元债券一千四百万元。其中很大部分是从中国人民身上搜括去的。他们除了留下若干充作营运基金外，其余都汇往本国去了。如果我们能把众业公所和它的那些著名外国经纪人的档案簿籍以及各有关外商企业的历年营业报告等设法搜集并汇合研究分析，一定可以取得重大的收获。
    要研究帝国主义对中国经济侵略的历史，英人在上海发行的“字林西报”是很好的参考资料之一。该报先于1850年8月3日以周刊（即华北捷报）形式出版，至1864年开始发行日刊，直至1941年12月9日，日军侵入苏州河以南地区，馆址被占而停刊。日本投降后，又于1945年10月8日复刊，直到美国帝国主义侵朝战争发生后不久才寿终正寝。它的全部内容，是一百年间帝国主义在中国横行霸道、进行种种经济掠夺的实录。这家报馆自己还保藏着一份珍贵的档案，其中包括有百年来中国的重要政事和帝国主义在中国的种种活动。太平洋战争爆发后，该报馆址即被日人所办的大陆日报占用，上项档案遂被日人全部搬走无踪，直到日本投降后，才在上海中山东一路二十七号怡和洋行的房子内发现，可能当初日人是企图把这份档案运往东京去的。这些东西后来由“字林西报”全部取回。该报结束已有六年，这部档案的下落如何，似有查明的必要。
    “字林西报”还出版有“行名簿”，从1865年出版的第一册起，每年出版一册，直至1941年为止，从未间断。虽然该书内容主要是记载上海、天津、汉口和广州等地外商企业的一般情况，外籍人员的姓名职衔和买办姓名，等等，但也可以从这里面发掘出有价值的研究资料。
    至于外国银行留在中国的档案资料，也一向不受重视。如德华银行早在第一次世界大战时停业过一次，行屋被北洋军阀政府没收，它的档案资料未必有人加以保存；又如华俄道胜银行和中法实业银行等先后亏折停业，均由我国代为负责清理，但其所有的文书档案清理完毕后，恐亦无人收拾，听其散失。抗日战争胜利之后，国民党反动政权接收了在中国的所有日本银行的一切档案帐册，其中属于正金银行的即有三百多箱，但因大部分都是在华各分行的历年帐册，其年代远溯到前清光绪中叶，因此认为已经失去时效，毫无价值。现在不知下落如何。实则它们的帐册和地主的帐册一样，都是研究中国近代经济史的珍贵资料，是不应当随便予以销毁的。
    应该指出，上海过去是帝国主义对中国进行经济侵略的大本营，它们的重要企业和商务机关都在上海生过根，它们留存的一些文字记录、簿籍帐册和历年向股东会提出的报告书等，无一不是研究帝国主义对我经济侵略情况的珍贵资料。所可惜的，从1941年以后，由于日本帝国主义者把外商经营的企业、机关，一律加以占领，并将主持人拘禁集中营，从而它们留下来的档案文书帐册，悉被任意搬走或听其散失。等到抗战胜利，日本投降，所有在华的日本企业和商务机关随即为国民党反动政权接收，它们的一切文书档案，也遭到同样的命运。解放前后，在华欧美商人急欲结束营业束装归国，那些累坠的文件簿籍，已无法携走，只好丢弃不管，或当作废纸变卖。可以想像得到，在这十几年里，散失和毁灭的珍贵史料，一定不少。
    此外，许多有关帝国主义对我经济压榨的史料，不少还存在于我们自己的商业团体或企业的手里。例如上海河南北路钱业会馆过去悬有一方匾额，记载数十年前外商银行如何恃势压迫钱庄退还代收汇款的一件案子经过。后来会馆改作别用，匾额一齐取下，听说已经销毁了。这件案子由于早年钱业没有档案，当时原想立匾以垂久远，现在已随着匾额的消灭而无从查考了。又如过去上海和天津两地的棉布匹头商专向国外定购洋布，由于我国用银而外国用金，外国银行遂得勾结洋行操纵汇价，上下其手，在订购时先令放长（即外汇下降）诱华商入彀，等货一到，就把先令改缩（即外汇上涨），往往害得定货者倾家荡产。较远如1904至1905年，较近则如1921年，津沪洋布商因定货到期、外汇暴腾、无力结价，破产倒闭的家数甚多，损失浩大，其中天津商人在1921年定了二千万两的货，损失即达英金五十万镑之巨。此等定货纠纷前后经过，当时津、沪两地的商会及洋布业公所等，当有详细卷宗，如果至今还存在的话，也是一件有价值的史料。
    年来各方面对于历史文物的爱护和发掘无微不至，我们时常看到在废铜烂铁中找到商周铜器，在废纸旧书里拣出明清善本；也时常听说在荒村残墟中发现名人遗迹或在萧寺破屋里获得太平天国史料，等等，不一而足，真是令人兴奋；但很少听到在故纸堆中或从旧货摊上发现某些有关帝国主义对中国经济侵略等一类的珍贵史料。这不是说明没有这类东西存在，而是反映大家对这问题没有好好注意。以上海为例，近年旧货摊贩从四面八方收来的外文书本、帐册、文件等不知有多少，有的直接成为纸厂的造纸原料，有的供应摊贩作包物品之用，有的转到旧书摊或旧货摊上论斤出卖，最后均归于消灭。如果能密切地和有关部门联系，将这些经常收下来的东西，在处理之前，先请研究机构详细审阅一过，可能随时发掘出不少有价值的史料。这些机会日在消逝，希望中国科学院和其他研究机关急起直追，给予应有的重视。
