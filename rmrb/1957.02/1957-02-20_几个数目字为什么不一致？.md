Why Are Some Numbers Inconsistent?

Reader Feng He writes: In several articles and news items concerning the Shimen Songxiang Agricultural Cooperative's pig farming, published on the first and third pages of the People's Daily on December 23rd of last year, there are several inconsistent figures. For example, in the article "Our Cooperative Will Raise 20,000 Pigs," the first paragraph states, "Currently, the entire cooperative only raises 4,110 pigs," while the news item "Over 95% of Shimen Songxiang Agricultural Cooperative Members Increase Income" (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd) states, "This cooperative currently feeds 17,097 pigs." Furthermore, the former article states, "Last year (1955), the yield was an average of 1,009 jin per mu," while the latter news item states, "The annual (1956) grain yield was 466 jin per mu." This means that the 1956 yield per mu was 543 jin less than in 1955. However, the article "'Our Cooperative Will Raise 20,000 Pigs' Plan is About to be Realized" states that this cooperative "increased production by 20%" last year compared to the previous year. What's going on?

Editor's Reply: Regarding the number of pigs raised by the Shimen Songxiang Agricultural Cooperative, the number "17,097" in the Xinhua News Agency's Jinan dispatch on the 22nd is the figure at that time; while "4,110" is the figure for the first half of last year. If we had indicated when the article "Our Cooperative Will Raise 20,000 Pigs," published in the eighth issue of the "Rural Work Bulletin" on December 20th of last year, was written, readers would not have been misled. As for the grain yield per mu, according to information from the Xinhua News Agency's Rural Group to the Jinan branch, "an average yield of 1,009 jin per mu" was the average yield per mu of the 59 households in the Shimen Song Village primary cooperative in 1955; while "an annual grain yield of 466 jin per mu" was the average yield per mu after the 2,700 households in Shimen Songxiang and other four townships were merged into an advanced cooperative in January of last year. The statement that the cooperative increased production last year compared to the previous year is based on a comparison of the average yield per mu in 1956 (466 jin) after the four townships were merged into an advanced cooperative, with the average yield per mu in 1955 (387 jin) when the four townships had not yet merged.

    几个数目字为什么不一致？
    读者冯和来信：去年12月23日人民日报第一版、第三版刊登的有关石门宋乡农业社养猪的几篇文章和新闻中，有几个数字不一致。如“我们一个社要养猪两万头”一文第一段中说“现在全社只养猪四千一百一十头”，而“石门宋乡农业社95％以上的社员增加收入”的消息（新华社济南22日电）中却是“这个社现在喂养的一万七千零九十七头生猪”。再如前一篇文章中说“去年（1955）的产量，每亩平均收到一千零九斤”，后一条消息中却说“每亩年（1956年）产粮食四百六十六斤”。这样，1956年的亩产数就比1955年少五百四十三斤，然而“‘我们一个社要养猪两万头’的计划就要实现”一文中，却说这个社去年比前年“增产二成”，这是怎么一回事呢？
    编者的答复：关于石门宋乡农业社养猪的头数问题，新华社济南22日电中“一万七千零九十七头”是当时的数字；而“四千一百一十头”则是去年上半年的数字。如果我们在转载去年12月20日出版的“农村工作通讯”第八期所刊“我们一个社要养猪两万头”一文的时候，注明此文写于何时，就不会使读者误解了。至于粮食的亩产量问题，经新华社农村组向济南分社了解，“每亩平均收到一千零九斤”，是石门宋村五十九户的初级社在1955年的平均亩产数；而“每亩年产粮食四百六十六斤”，则是石门宋乡等四个乡的两千七百多户农民在去年1月转并为高级社后的亩产平均数。所说该社去年比前年增产，这是根据1956年四个乡转并为一个高级社后的平均亩产数（四百六十六斤）与1955年四个乡未转并为一个高级社时的平均亩产数（三百八十七斤）比较而得出的。
