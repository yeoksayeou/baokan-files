This newspaper article reports the following:
    Hunan is accelerating the construction and repair of key water conservancy projects and most general water conservancy projects. Among them, 764 reservoirs have been completed, accounting for 31.8% of the planned tasks. More than 190,000 general ponds, dams, canals, and ditches have been completed, accounting for 26.6% of the planned tasks. The larger key water conservancy projects have been basically completed or are nearing completion.
    The broad masses of laborers and water conservancy engineering technicians have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity in the winter water conservancy work. When ice and snow froze and broke the branches of large trees, many laborers at the reservoir construction sites still wrapped the steel chisels used for chiseling stones with straw, and used hammers to break the ice frozen in the waterlogged areas of the construction sites, continuing to persist in construction. At the Zhang Jiutai dike relocation construction site in Anxiang County, sixteen of the twenty-six-mile-long new dike line had to pass through lakes and ports, and the bottom layer of the lakes and ports was all silt, making construction very difficult. The heroic laborers drained the accumulated water from these lakes and ports, wove rafts from pine wood, and "pressed" the thin and soft silt before building the dike on top of it. Some laborers at the reservoir construction sites used the motto "A single inch not tight, ten thousand feet not strong" to warn themselves, adopting the method of "thin filling, tight ramming" to build the dam body solid. Some areas paid attention to conservation in the winter water conservancy work, reducing construction costs. For example, Tong Biao, a blaster at the Renhe Dam irrigation project construction site in Ningyuan County, created a triangular steel chisel to replace the general steel chisel for drilling blasting holes, enabling one blaster to do the work of two blasters in a day. Carpenter Zhang Xibin invented and improved more than ten kinds of tools, saving the state more than 7,000 yuan.

    湖南水利冬修正在加紧进行
    许多民工特别重视工程质量和降低修建成本
    本报讯　湖南计划新建和整修的重点水利工程以及大部分一般水利工程，都已经先后开工，其中水库已经完成七百六十四座，占计划任务的31.8％；一般的塘、坝、圳、沟等已经完成十九万多处，占计划任务的26.6％。规模较大的重点水利工程都已经基本完成或接近完成。
    广大民工和水利工程技术人员在水利冬修工作中发挥了高度的劳动热情和创造精神。当冰雪把大树的枝干都冻得折断了的时候，不少水库工地上的民工仍然用稻草裹住凿石用的钢钎，用锤子击破冻结在工地积水地带的冰块，继续坚持施工。在安乡县张九台移堤工地上，一条长达二十六里的新堤堤线中有十六里长的堤线要穿湖过港，湖港的底层尽是淤泥，施工非常困难。英勇的民工便把这些湖港的积水排干，用松木编成簰，把又稀又软的淤泥“压”住，然后再在上面筑堤。有些水库工地上的民工，用“一寸不紧，万丈不牢”的格言警惕自己，采取“薄填土、紧捶硪”的办法，把坝身筑得结结实实。有些地区在水利冬修工作中注意节约，降低了修建成本。如宁远县仁和坝灌溉工程工地炮工童彪创造三角钢钎来代替一般钢钎打炮眼，使一个炮工一天能干两个炮工的活；木工张锡斌发明和改良十多种工具，为国家节约了七千多元。
