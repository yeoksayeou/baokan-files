Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng reported: Currently, on the industrial production front, people are brewing two important questions. One is, "Even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice," how can production be increased when raw materials are insufficient? The other is, should labor competitions still be held when machines are "starving"?

The shortage of raw materials in industrial production already appeared in the second half of last year, and became even more acute in January of this year. The reason is that the scale of capital construction was somewhat too large last year; at the same time, more than a hundred newly built large factories have been put into production in whole or in part, so the production of industrial raw materials and building materials such as coal, iron ore, cotton, wood, and steel cannot keep up with demand. This tension will not be easily changed for a while and will become a prominent difficulty in industrial production throughout the year. However, on the other hand, the country's construction and the improvement of people's lives urgently require increased industrial production. With raw materials in short supply, yet production needs to be increased, this is where the difficulty lies.

So, is there a way out? Judging from all aspects, the answer is affirmative. The way out lies in the departments that produce raw materials "doing everything possible" to increase the production of raw materials, and the departments that use raw materials "doing everything possible" to save raw materials. Doing everything possible to increase the production of raw materials and save raw materials is the main way to overcome the difficulties in industrial production this year, and it is also a characteristic of this year's industrial sector's increase in production and economy.

However, some people still have various doubts about the potential for increasing production and saving. They say, "We have been increasing production and saving every year, there is no more to squeeze out," or they believe that their company is special, and the technology and products of their company are advanced foreign technology and standard products and cannot be improved, and so on. However, the facts show that even these companies still have ways to increase production and save. The Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory produces two types of diesel engines, 60 horsepower and 40 horsepower, and its drawings are based on foreign products. Some designers in this factory originally believed that there was nothing to be saved in this product. However, after the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory changed the design of the same type of product, the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, after detailed analysis and research, also modified the design and process methods of the two diesel engines. As a result, 300 to 400 kilograms of steel were saved per unit, and the steel saved throughout the year could produce more than 200 40-horsepower diesel engines. China's textile industry has made great achievements in saving cotton in recent years, so some people think that it is no longer possible to save. However, the Shanghai Textile Bureau, after research and trial production, proved that by spinning the yarn of nineteen kinds of cotton cloth finer, 1.2 million more bolts of cloth can be produced this year, and the quality of the cotton cloth will not be affected. Similar examples can be cited a lot.

Up to now, many enterprises have formed special groups according to different workshops and different jobs to conduct a thorough investigation, investigate ways to increase production and save, and understand the thoughts of the masses to determine the direction of increasing production and saving in their enterprises. About 60% of the enterprises in Tianjin have done the preliminary investigation, and 30% of the enterprises have formulated measures to increase production and save according to the preliminary investigation. Some enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the Ministry of Light Industry have also taken some effective measures. Trade union organizations in fifteen provinces or cities across the country have also carried out work in this regard. All the results of the investigation and research and the proposed measures prove that a lot of raw materials can be saved in improving design, improving process processing or operating methods, reducing waste products, using waste and old materials, widely adopting substitutes, reducing raw material consumption quotas, and reducing the storage time of semi-finished products and raw materials, thus opening up a broad road for increasing production.

Regarding the issue of labor competitions, some enterprise departments of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry raised the question: If raw materials are insufficient, should we still "compete"? "What should we compete on"? This question also exists in other departments with insufficient raw materials. They hesitate and wander in the face of this powerful weapon for organizing the masses—labor competition (advanced producer movement), as if this weapon has no "place to use." Therefore, it is very necessary to clarify this thinking. The leadership of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's answer to this question is: It must be competed, compete on whatever link is weak, and whatever is most difficult. If ore is lacking, the mine will compete to increase production; blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces will compete to save raw materials; if product quality is poor, they will compete on quality; if there are many defective products, they will compete to reduce defective products... Some enterprises in this ministry are preparing to convene a representative meeting of advanced producers to start mobilization. This approach of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is realistic and seems to be suitable for all industrial and mining enterprises.

### 原材料不足能不能增产和竞赛？  千方百计地增产和节约原材料是克服困难的主要方法  什么环节薄弱，什么最困难，就在什么方面展开竞赛

    原材料不足能不能增产和竞赛？
    千方百计地增产和节约原材料是克服困难的主要方法
    什么环节薄弱，什么最困难，就在什么方面展开竞赛
    新华社9日讯　新华社记者李峰报道：目前在工业生产战线上，人们酝酿着两个重要问题。一个是“巧媳妇作不出没米的饭”，原材料不足怎样增产？一个是机器“吃不饱”还搞不搞劳动竞赛？
    工业生产中原材料不足的情况，去年下半年就已经出现，今年1月，显得更加紧张。原因是去年基本建设规模过大了些；同时又有一百多个新建的大工厂全部或部分投入生产，所以煤炭、铁矿石、棉花、木材和钢材等工业原料和建筑材料的生产，就赶不上需要。这种紧张一时还不易改变，将成为全年工业生产的突出困难。然而，另一方面国家的建设和人民生活的改善，又迫切需要工业增产。原材料既紧张，又要增加生产，这就是困难所在。
    那么，有没有出路呢？从各方面的情况看来，答复是肯定的。出路就在于生产原材料的部门，“千方百计”的增产原材料，使用原材料的部门，“千方百计”的节约原材料。千方百计的增产原材料和节约原材料，就是克服今年工业生产中的困难的主要办法，也是今年工业部门增产节约的特点。
    但是，有部分人对增产节约的潜力，仍然有着种种怀疑。他们说：“年年增产节约，没有油水了”，或者认为本企业特殊，本企业的工艺和产品都是国外先进的工艺和标准产品无法改进等等。可是，事实表明，即使是这样一些企业，也仍然有增产节约的办法。上海柴油机厂生产的六十马力和四十马力的两种柴油机，其图纸是根据国外产品测绘的。这个厂有的设计人员原来认为这种产品在节约上是没有油水的。但是，无锡柴油机厂改变了同种类型产品的设计之后，上海柴油机厂经过详细的分析研究，也修改了那两种柴油机的设计和工艺方法。结果每台节省钢铁三百到四百公斤，全年节省的钢铁可以生产二百多台四十马力的柴油机。我国纺织工业，近几年节约用棉有很大成绩，因此，有人就认为再不能节约了。可是上海纺织管理局经过研究和试制，证明把十九种棉布的纱纺细些，今年就可以增产一百二十万匹布，而且棉布的质量不受影响。类此事例还可以举出很多。
    到目前为止，很多企业，根据不同的车间，不同的工作，组成了专门的小组，进行摸底工作，调查研究增产节约的门路，了解群众的思想，以确定本企业增产节约的方向。天津市约有60％的企业作了摸底工作，有30％的企业根据摸底的情况，制定了增产节约的措施。冶金工业部、第一机械工业部和轻工业部等所属的一些企业，也采取了一些有效的措施。全国有十五个省或市的工会组织，在这方面也进行了工作。所有调查研究的结果和拟定的措施证明，在改进设计、改进工艺加工或操作方法、减少废品、利用废品旧料、广泛采用代用品、降低原材料消耗定额、减少半成品和原材料库存时间等等方面，都可以节省很多原材料，因此也就能给增产开拓宽广的道路。
    关于劳动竞赛的问题，冶金工业部有的企业部门提出：原材料不足还“赛不赛”？“赛什么”？这个问题，在其它原材料不足的部门同样存在着。他们在这个组织群众有力的武器——劳动竞赛（先进生产者运动）面前，犹豫徘徊，似乎这个武器已无“用武之地”。因此，澄清这种思想就非常必要。冶金部领导方面对这个问题的回答是：肯定要赛，什么环节薄弱，什么最困难，就赛什么。矿石缺，矿山就赛增产；高炉、平炉就赛节约原料；产品质量差的，就赛质量；废品多的，就赛减少废品……。这个部有的企业已准备召开先进生产者代表会议，开始动员。冶金工业部的这种作法，是实事求是的，看来也是适合于所有工矿企业的。
