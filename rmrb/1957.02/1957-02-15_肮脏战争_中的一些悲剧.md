Some Tragedies in the "Dirty War"

Lovers Find it Hard to Marry

Recently, the French National Institute of Statistics announced that the number of marriages in France in 1956 decreased by 5.6% compared to 1955.

What is the reason for this? The "dirty war" in Algeria has made it impossible for many lovers to marry.

As early as a few months ago, a French statistical agency warned that the Algerian war had already caused the number of marriages in France in the first half of 1956 to drop by 3.3% compared to the same period in 1955; if this war continues, the number of marriages in the second half of 1956 will drop even more sharply. However, solely for the sake of the colonial bosses' pockets, the dirty war continues, and the flames are burning ever more fiercely. The warning from this statistical agency has finally become a reality.

The Saddest Thing is Separation

When the Mollet government came to power in early 1956, there were only 150,000 French troops stationed in Algeria; but now, according to some French newspapers, there are already 600,000. A large number of reservists were called up, which not only delayed the happy occasion for many young men and women, but also plunged countless families into misfortune.

On April 13, 1956, the Mollet government ordered the mobilization of 200,000 reservists at one time – the largest mobilization in France since 1939.

In the 1939 mobilization, the young men who enlisted and their relatives said goodbye in an atmosphere of excitement and enthusiasm. The call to "resist Nazi aggression! Defend France!" stirred their hearts. But now, the young men who are enlisting and their relatives are asking in their hearts: For the benefit of a small group of big bosses, what is the reason for separating us?

Severed Finger Means Guilt and Prison

In the call-up, there were many tragedies like that of "Xin Feng's arm-broken old man."

Théothile, a 24-year-old youth from Rouen, immediately married a woman who already had three children after receiving his enlistment notice, and then asked his brother-in-law to chop off his index finger with an axe. He thought that in this way, he could avoid even greater misfortune.

However, Théothile's behavior was considered a crime. He was sentenced to one year in prison for refusing to serve in the military; even his brother-in-law was imprisoned for four months as an "accomplice" to serve as a warning to others.

Countless Skeletal Remains Buried in Foreign Lands

Indeed, compared to Théothile's plight, the disasters of the French youths who were conscripted to Algeria were much more terrible. They were ordered to plunge a large number of peaceful Algerian residents, who had no grudges against them, into a pool of blood; many of their comrades turned into piles of bones in foreign lands, and those who were still alive were in danger of being shot at any time.

Regarding their uneasy situation, an eyewitness gave the following description: In some places, French soldiers even have to hang grenades on their belts, lean their guns on their arms, or put machine guns on their knees when going to cafes or restaurants to guard against sudden attacks by Algerian insurgents.

How many French youths have become skeletal remains and been buried in foreign lands because of this "dirty war"? The office of the French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, announced on May 25, 1956, that this was not allowed to be reported unless officially permitted. Isn't it because the number has become too large to be made public?

Sparse Production After Conscription

The massive conscription of reservists is also a tragedy for the French economy.

More and more skilled workers are putting on military uniforms and being separated from production for a long time, and the shortage of labor in French industrial sectors is becoming more and more serious. At present, 40% of enterprises across France have had to reduce production as a result; and in the Paris region, the number of enterprises that have reduced production has reached 50%. In addition, the business of 42% of stores and 60% of engineering companies has also been affected.

In the coal mining industry, it is estimated that coal production will be reduced by 2 million tons due to a shortage of skilled workers. Therefore, in the first eight months of 1956, France imported 26% more coal from West Germany and Belgium than in the same period in 1955; while coal exports were greatly reduced. This has further increased France's foreign trade deficit. (West)

### “肮脏战争”中的一些悲剧

    “肮脏战争”中的一些悲剧
    有情人难成眷属
    最近，法国全国统计局宣布：1956年法国结婚数字比1955年降低了5.6％。
    这是什么缘故呢？阿尔及利亚的“肮脏战争”，使得许多有情人成不了眷属。
    早在几个月以前，法国有一个统计机构就提出警告说：阿尔及利亚战争已经使得法国1956年上半年的结婚数字比1955年同期下降了3.3％；如果这个仗再打下去，1956年下半年的结婚数字会下降的更厉害。可是，仅仅是为了殖民老板们的钱袋的缘故，肮脏的战争还在打下去，而且烽火越燃越炽。这个统计机构的警告就终于成了事实。
    最伤心事是别离
    当1956年初摩勒政府上台时，法国驻阿尔及利亚的军队只有十五万人；而现在，据法国的一些报纸报道，已经有六十万人了。大批后备人员被召入伍，不但误了许多男女青年的佳期，而且使无数家庭陷入了不幸中。
    1956年4月13日这一天，摩勒政府一次下令征召二十万后备人员入伍——这是1939年以来法国最大的一次征召。
    在1939年的征召中，应征入伍的年青人和他们的亲人是在振奋和激昂的情绪下话别的，“抵抗纳粹侵略！保卫法兰西！”的召唤激动着他们的心。但是现在，应征入伍的青年人和他们亲人们心里在问：为了一小撮大老板的利益，要使我们分离，这是什么道理啊？
    断指有罪入囹圄
    在征召声中，出现了不少像“新丰折臂翁”那样的惨事。
    卢昂地方二十四岁的青年特奥铁在接到入伍征召书以后，马上同一个已经有三个孩子的妇女结婚，然后请大舅子用斧头把他的食指砍掉。他以为，这样一来，自己就能免掉更大的不幸了。
    然而，特奥铁的行为被认为有罪。他以拒服兵役的罪名被判处徒刑一年；连他的大舅子也因为“帮凶”而被囚禁四个月，以儆效尤。
    枯骨无数埋异乡
    的确，比起特奥铁的遭遇来，那些被征召到阿尔及利亚去的法国青年们的灾难是要可怕得多了。他们奉命把大批同他们无冤无仇的阿尔及利亚的和平居民投入血泊；他们自己许多的同伴也在异乡变成了一堆枯骨，而活着的也处在随时可能被击毙的危险中。
    关于他们不安的处境，有一个目击者作了这样的描述：在某些地方，法国的士兵甚至在上咖啡馆或者餐馆的时候，也要把手榴弹挂在腰带上，把枪靠在手臂上，或者把机关枪放在膝盖上，来防备突如其来的阿尔及利亚起义者的袭击。
    究竟有多少法国青年，已经因为这场“肮脏战争”而身成枯骨、长埋异乡了呢？法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特的办公室在1956年5月25日宣布说：除非有官方允许，这是不准报道的。难道不是因为数目已经多得不便公布？
    生产寥落征召后
    大量征召后备人员入伍，对法国的经济来说也是一场悲剧。
    越来越多的各种熟练工人穿上军装而长期脱离了生产，法国工业部门缺乏劳动力的情况就一天比一天严重。目前，在法国全国已经有40％的企业不得不因而缩减生产；而在巴黎区，缩减生产的企业已经达到50％。另外，有42％的商店和60％的工程公司业务也受到了影响。
    在煤矿工业中，由于熟练工人不足，估计煤产量就要减少二百万吨。因此，1956年头八个月，法国从西德和比利时输入的煤就比1955年同期增加了26％；而出口的煤却大大减少了。这又使得法国对外贸易的逆差增多了。　　　（西）
