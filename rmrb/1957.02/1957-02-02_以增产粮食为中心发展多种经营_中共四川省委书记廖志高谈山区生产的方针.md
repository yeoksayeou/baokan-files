    Developing Diversified Economy with Increased Grain Production as the Center
    Liao Zhigao, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, Talks About the Production Policy in Mountainous Areas

    (Our News) "Mountainous area production should still focus on increasing grain production while developing diversified economy to reserve and transport grain for the country." This statement was made by Comrade Liao Zhigao, Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, at the recent Sichuan Provincial Conference of Advanced Agricultural, Forestry, Water Conservancy, and Meteorological Production (Work) Representatives.

    After correcting the neglect of developing diversified economy in 1956, some agricultural cooperatives in Sichuan Province overemphasized the development of diversified economy, developing economic forests, local specialties, and other sideline occupations, but regarding grain production, some people advocated "enough to eat is enough." If this continues, it will inevitably affect the increase of grain production in mountainous areas.

    Why should mountainous areas focus on increasing grain production? Comrade Liao Zhigao said, "First, the vast majority of the mountainous economy is still grain and animal husbandry that cannot be separated from grain; second, many mountainous areas have an average of about eight hundred catties of grain per person. If we only talk about 'enough to eat,' it will cause farmers in mountainous areas to relax on grain production, to engage in returning farmland to forest, and to engage in diversified economy, which will reduce grain production. This is not beneficial to the country or the people's livelihood." This is an issue involving the production policy in mountainous areas of Sichuan.

    The representatives attending the meeting fully agreed with this view. Agricultural cooperatives that had deviations on this issue decided to correct it upon their return. A representative from a mountainous agricultural cooperative in An County wrote a letter back during the meeting. The cooperative had a total of 527 mu of land and originally planned to allocate 270 mu to return farmland to forest and plant walnut trees, and even the seedlings were cultivated. The representative wrote back, suggesting that the cooperative replant the walnut trees on barren slopes.

    After studying the ways to increase grain production in mountainous areas, the representatives from mountainous areas believed that the potential for increasing grain production in mountainous areas of Sichuan is very large. Generally speaking, mountainous areas do not lack land, do not lack fertilizer, have a mild climate, and have a longer frost-free period. Some mountainous areas can harvest two or three crops a year, which is a powerful proof.

### 以增产粮食为中心发展多种经营  中共四川省委书记廖志高谈山区生产的方针

    以增产粮食为中心发展多种经营
    中共四川省委书记廖志高谈山区生产的方针
    本报讯　“山区生产仍然应该以增产粮食为中心，来发展多种经营，为国家储备和运送粮食。”这话是中共四川省委书记廖志高同志在最近召开的四川省农业、林业、水利、气象先进生产（工作）者代表大会上讲的。
    四川省各地在1956年纠正了不注重发展多种经营以后，有些山区的农业社片面地强调发展多种经营，发展经济林木、土特产和其他副业，但对于粮食生产，有人主张“够吃就行了”。这样发展下去，势必要影响山区的粮食增产。
    为什么山区要以粮食增产为中心呢？廖志高同志说：“第一，山区经济绝大部分还是粮食和与粮食不能分离的畜牧业；第二，不少山区每人平均收入的粮食就有八百斤左右，如果只提够吃，那就会使山区农民放松粮食增产，去搞停耕还林，去搞多种经营，使粮食减少，这对国家、对人民生活都不利。”这是一个涉及到四川山区生产方针的问题。
    出席会议的代表们完全赞同这个意见。在这个问题上犯有偏差的农业社，都决定回去纠正过来。安县有个山区农业社的代表，在会议期间就写信回去。这个社总共有五百二十七亩田，原来准备拨出二百七十亩停耕还林、种核桃树，连树苗都培育好了。这位代表写信回去，建议社里把核桃树改栽在荒坡上。
    山区代表们研究了山区增产粮食的办法后，认为四川山区增产粮食的潜力是很大的。一般说来，山区土地不缺，肥料不缺，气候温和，无霜期较长。这样好的自然条件，黄河以北的一些地区都是赶不上的。有些山区，一年能够收两熟、三熟，就是一个有力的证明。
