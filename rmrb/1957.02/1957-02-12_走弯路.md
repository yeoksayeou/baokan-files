Taking Detours
Qin Wen

    In Hangzhou, I used to take rickshaws, but now I take tricycle rickshaws or cars. When traveling between Zhaoqing Temple and J亭 Bridge, the drivers always prefer to go along the small road beside the Huansha Creek, instead of taking the wide road directly. Earlier in Beijing, I often felt that rickshaw pullers liked to take small alleys, avoiding the straight main streets, and always winding around in the small alleys. When turning in the small alleys, it was difficult for two vehicles to run side by side, so they often had to "stop." At first, I was a bit annoyed by this situation. Later, I realized that taking a few more turns was actually to shorten the distance. "A broken line is greater than a straight line," and although most drivers hadn't studied "geometry," they knew from experience that taking an extra turn could save effort and gasoline. The working people are good at careful calculations, and this was understandable. – On the main street, you have to make almost right-angle turns according to traffic rules; in the alleys, turning means not taking the two sides of a triangle, but only taking one diagonal line. Accumulating turn after turn, the distance can be shortened considerably. Taking the diagonal of a triangle is the most economical way, so there are always many vehicles traveling on the diagonal streets, and vehicles traveling between Zhaoqing Temple and J亭 Bridge often have to travel on the road along Huansha Creek, because they want to take the "diagonal."

    "Taking detours" seems undesirable; but "detours" actually have different qualities. As mentioned above, driving in alleys, as long as you don't get lost, taking a few more turns can shorten the distance. I remember Mr. Sun Yat-sen once gave such an example: He had to rush to a meeting on time, and time was already tight; he told the driver that the car had to arrive in a few minutes. The driver did drive very fast, but the route he took was beyond Mr. Sun Yat-sen's expectations, as he took a long detour. As a result, the car arrived just in time for the meeting. Mr. Sun Yat-sen didn't say anything at first, but asked later: Why did you go so fast but still take a long detour? The driver replied: Because the close road was congested with traffic, and he had to stop from time to time, so the time couldn't be accurately calculated. It was better to take a long detour, which he was sure could get him there. Mr. Sun Yat-sen trusted the driver and wasn't afraid of him "taking a detour," so he arrived at the meeting on time. Not long ago, I went to the train station to pick up a foreign guest, and first went to the Liuhe Pagoda to pick up a professor to travel with me. Time was already tight, and I wanted the driver to take the "No. 2 bus" route directly to the train station, but the driver wanted to go to the train station via Hupao Temple from Qixia, on the grounds that taking the No. 2 bus route near Nanxing Bridge might be blocked by passing trains, and the road surface was in poor condition, so it was better to take a long detour, which he was sure could get me there. This reminded me of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's story, and I admired the driver. As a result, I made it on time.

    Since "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," many traditional plays have been staged, and classical literature has attracted the attention of many people. Now, in newspapers, magazines, and on the stage, the creation reflecting the new life is proportionately less. Therefore, some people worry and fear that we have taken a detour. Now we do need more creations reflecting the new life; but the new culture cannot be produced out of thin air. Lenin said, "Proletarian culture must be the logical development of the knowledge accumulated by mankind under the yoke of capitalist society, landlord society and bureaucratic society." Lu Xun said, "The new class and its culture do not fall from the sky suddenly, but mostly develop in resistance to the old rulers and their culture, that is, in opposition to the old ones. Therefore, the new culture still has some inheritance, and still makes some selections from the old culture." He also said, "We have a history of art, and since we were born in China, we must turn to the Chinese history of art... just as we eat cattle and sheep, discarding the hooves and hair, and retaining their essence, to nourish and develop the new body."

    Let a hundred flowers bloom – "Turn to the Chinese history of art." Weed through the old to bring forth the new – "Discard the hooves and hair, retain the essence." Let a hundred schools of thought contend. On the one hand, this can draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas; on the other hand, it allows ideas to be exposed without reservation, so that we can study together, help each other, and correct each other. The question is whether we can "discard," "retain," "absorb," and "criticize." As long as we can do this, why be afraid of taking detours? As long as we understand the process by which the new culture is produced, we will not be afraid of taking detours. If we are afraid of taking detours and stop implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," then we will truly have taken a detour!

    走弯路
    钦文
    在杭州，以前坐人力车，现在坐三轮车或者汽车，当往来昭庆寺和井亭桥之间，驾驶车子的工人总是喜欢经过沿着浣纱溪的小路，不愿意一直顺着广阔的马路的。早先在北京，我也时常感觉到拉车工人的喜欢走小胡同，避开平直的大街，老是在小胡同里弯来弯去；在小胡同转弯，两辆车子难以并行，因此不时地要“站住”。当初我有点厌恶这种情况。后来感觉到了多转几个弯，原是为着缩短些路程，“折线大于直线”，一般驾驶车子的工人虽然没有学过“几何”，可是凭经验，多转一个弯，可以少花些力气、节省点汽油。劳动人民善于精打细算，这样做原是可感的。——在大街上按照交通规则要几乎直角地转弯；在胡同里转弯就是不走三角形的两腰，只走一条对角线。一个弯一个弯地累积起来，路程可以缩短不少。走三角形的对角线是最经济的办法，所以往来在斜街上的车子总是特别多，往来在昭庆寺和井亭桥之间的车子常要到沿浣纱溪的那条路上去行驶，原是要走“对角线”的缘故。
    “走弯路”好像是要不得的；可是“弯路”，实在有着各种不同的性质。像上面说的，在胡同里行车，只要不弄错方向，多转几个弯，是可以缩短路程的。记得孙中山先生曾经举过这样的例子：他守约要赶去出席会议，时间已经很局促；他告诉司机，汽车必须在几分钟内开到。那位司机的确把车子开得很快，可是所走的路线，出于孙中山先生的意料，是在远道绕过去，就是走了弯路的。结果，车子开到刚好是要开会的时候。孙中山先生当初不则声，到了以后才探问：为什么要快，反而远绕了路？那位司机回答说：因为走近路，路上车辆拥挤，不时地要停驶，时间算不准，不如远绕些路一直可以开到的有把握。孙中山先生是信任司机的，不怕他“走弯路”，所以准时到了会场。不久以前我到城站去接外宾，先到六和塔接得一位教授同行，时间已经局促，我要司机走“二路车”的路线直达城站，司机却要经过虎跑寺从旗下转往城站，理由是走二路车的路线在南星桥附近怕有火车经过被拦住，而且路面较坏，不如远绕些路有把握。我因此记起来了孙中山先生的故事，佩服这位司机，结果也赶上了时刻。
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”以来，许多传统剧目上演，古典文学已为许多人注意，如今报章、杂志和舞台上，按比例说，反映新生活的创作反而更少了；因此有人疑虑，害怕走了弯路。现在我们的确需要更多反映新生活的创作；可是新文化不能凭空产生。列宁说，“无产阶级文化应当是人类在资本主义社会、地主社会、官僚社会压迫下所创造出来的知识总汇发展的必然结果。”鲁迅先生说，“新的阶级及其文化，并非突然从天而降，大抵是发达于旧支配者及其文化反抗中，亦即发达于和旧者的对立中，所以新文化仍然有所承传，于旧文化也仍然有所择取。”他又说，“我们有艺术史，而且生在中国，即必须翻开中国的艺术史来。……恰如吃用牛羊，弃去蹄毛，留其精粹，以滋养及发达新的生体。”
    百花齐放——“翻开中国的艺术史来”。推陈出新——“弃去蹄毛，留其精粹。”百家争鸣，这一方面可以集思广益，另方面使得毫不保留地暴露思想，以便共同研究，互相帮助、纠正。问题在于能否“弃”、“留”、“吸收”和“批评”。只要能够这样，何必怕走弯路？只要明白了新文化产生的过程，是不会怕走弯路的。如果怕走弯路而中止“百花齐放，百家争鸣”这方针的贯彻执行，那就真地走了弯路了罢！
