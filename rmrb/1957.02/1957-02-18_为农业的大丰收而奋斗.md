    As the people of the whole country are stepping up their efforts to finally complete the first Five-Year Plan, the National Congress of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives has opened. This is the first grand meeting of advanced producers and advanced workers on the agricultural front after the great victory of the agricultural cooperation movement in our country. We respectfully wish the conference a complete success.
    As everyone knows, China suffered from severe natural disasters in 1956; however, the national output of major agricultural products in 1956 still increased somewhat compared with the bumper harvest of 1955. This is because, on the basis of cooperation and new relations of production, a high tide of agricultural production was universally set off in rural areas across the country. Various localities have launched large-scale mass movements in farmland water conservancy construction, reform of cultivation systems, improvement of production technology, promotion of superior varieties, increased fertilizer accumulation, and resistance to natural disasters, giving full play to enormous creativity and initiative. In all production construction and disaster relief activities, labor models have been at the forefront of the masses. With a high degree of socialist enthusiasm, they have warmly responded to the call of the Party and the government and worked diligently. They are not only good at accepting new things and new knowledge, taking the lead in learning and disseminating new technologies and new experiences, but also using their wisdom to create many advanced production and work experiences, effectively guiding the broad masses forward. They have become good examples that attract the broad masses to build a new socialist life and are sincerely supported by the broad masses.
    At this meeting, labor models from various regions and positions will exchange their rich experiences, learn from each other, encourage each other, and move forward together. Through this meeting, they will more clearly recognize the glorious tasks before them and make greater efforts to realize these glorious tasks.
    At present, the most important task facing all farmers and agricultural workers in the country is to fully utilize the superior conditions of cooperation, develop agriculture, animal husbandry, and various sideline occupations as much as possible, and produce more grain, cotton, oil crops, sugar crops, hemp, silk, tea, and other agricultural products, and more livestock products as well as native and special products, to meet the needs of the country and the people.
    In the past few years, China's agricultural production has developed rapidly. However, the increase in agricultural products still lags behind the rapidly growing needs of the country and the people. Therefore, we must not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made, but must make persistent efforts and make greater efforts in the future.
    Under China's specific conditions, what should we rely on to develop agricultural production? Since it is impossible for our country to universally use agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers in large quantities for a considerably long period of time, the most important and reliable way to increase agricultural production is to rely on the superior system of cooperation and adopt various effective measures to increase production in accordance with local conditions. The large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and various technological reforms carried out in various places last year are important factors in increasing agricultural production. We must not fundamentally negate these measures simply because some shortcomings and errors have occurred in their implementation. We should carefully summarize and absorb past experiences, strengthen our confidence, give play to the spirit of active advancement, and correctly implement various measures to increase production.
    In order to develop production, it is necessary to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives. At present, most agricultural production cooperatives in the country have a short history, and their management has not yet been fully on track. There are many complex problems within the cooperatives that need to be solved urgently. This requires us to rectify them in a planned and step-by-step manner, further implement the policy of running the cooperatives democratically and thriftily, gradually improve the management of agricultural cooperatives, properly adjust the relationships between members, between cooperatives, and between cooperatives and the state, and constantly improve the socialist consciousness of the cooperative members, increase labor productivity, increase production, and increase the income of the members. In this way, after three to five years of efforts, we will definitely be able to completely consolidate the existing agricultural cooperatives economically, organizationally, and ideologically, and stabilize the new relations of production and the order of the new society in the countryside. This is a fundamental guarantee for the continuous development of agricultural production.
    More and more advanced producers are emerging on the agricultural production front in our country. The Party and the government should regard them as the valuable wealth of the country and the people. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee at the National Congress of Advanced Producers on April 30 last year: "Advanced producers are an indispensable part of the leadership of society and the country; without advanced producers, there can be no completely correct leadership." It should be admitted that carrying out large-scale collective agricultural production in accordance with socialist principles is still a new undertaking for us. Any leader, any labor model, and any activist who wants to lead the broad masses to do this undertaking well, and to avoid or reduce mistakes, must prevent arrogance, complacency and exaggerated mood, resolutely implement the mass line, consult with the masses more often in case of trouble, and learn more from the masses. A valuable experience in agricultural production leadership in recent years is that: wherever the mass line is conscientiously implemented in leading production, there is a real increase in production; conversely, wherever the mass line is neglected, the production leadership makes this or that mistake, causing losses to the masses and the country. We hope that labor models and activists in various places will always pay great attention to maintaining their fine style of modesty and close ties with the masses at all times. Only in this way can we make continuous progress.
    Comrade labor models! The spring plowing this year is coming soon. The Party and the government hope that after this meeting, you will exchange experiences, encourage each other, and better lead the broad masses of farmers to launch a larger-scale agricultural production increase movement with greater confidence and higher enthusiasm, and strive for a great harvest in 1957!

### 为农业的大丰收而奋斗

    为农业的大丰收而奋斗
    正当全国人民为最后完成第一个五年计划而加紧努力的时候，全国农业劳动模范代表会议召开了。这是我国农业战线上的先进生产者和先进工作者在农业合作化运动取得伟大胜利以后的第一次大会师。我们敬祝会议的圆满成功。
    大家知道，1956年我国遭受了严重的自然灾害；但是，1956年全国主要农产品的产量比丰收的1955年还有某些增加。这是因为在合作化的基础上，在新的生产关系的基础上，全国农村中普遍掀起了农业生产的高潮。各地在兴修农田水利、改革耕作制度、改良生产技术、推广优良品种、增积肥料、抗御自然灾害等方面，展开了群众性的大规模的运动，发挥了巨大的创造性和积极性。在所有的生产建设和抗灾活动中，劳动模范们都走在群众的前面。他们以高度的社会主义积极性，热烈地响应了党和政府的号召，勤勤恳恳地劳动。他们不但善于接受新事物、新知识，带头学习和传播新技术、新经验，而且用自己的智慧创造出许多先进的生产经验和工作经验，有力地引导广大群众前进。他们成了吸引广大群众建设社会主义新生活的好榜样，受到广大群众的衷心拥护。
    在这次会议上，来自各个地区、各个岗位的劳动模范们将交流他们丰富的经验，互相学习，互相鼓励，共同前进。通过这次会议，他们将更加明确地认识摆在自己面前的光荣任务，并且为实现这些光荣任务作更大的努力。
    目前，摆在全国农民和一切农业工作者面前的最主要的任务，就是要充分运用合作化的优越条件，尽一切可能发展农业、畜牧业和各种副业，生产更多的粮食、棉花、油料、糖料、麻、丝、茶等农产品，生产更多的畜产品以及土产和特产品，以适应国家和人民的需要。
    过去几年，我国的农业生产已经有较快的发展。但是，农产品的增产仍然落后于国家和人民迅速增长的需要。因此，我们决不能满足于已有的若干成就，而必须再接再厉，在今后作更大的努力。
    在我国的具体条件下，发展农业生产依靠什么呢？由于我国在一个相当长的时期内不可能普遍地大量使用农业机械和化学肥料，因此增加农业生产的最主要和最可靠的办法，就是依靠合作化的优越制度，因地制宜，采取各种有效的增产措施。去年各地大量进行的农田水利建设和各种技术改革，就是使农业增产的重要因素。我们决不能因为在推行中发生过某些缺点和错误而根本否定这些措施。我们应当很好地总结和吸取过去的经验，更加坚定信心，发挥积极进取的精神，正确地推行各种增产措施。
    为了发展生产，必须巩固农业生产合作社。现在，全国大多数农业生产合作社的历史较短，经营管理还没有完全走上轨道，社内存在着许多亟待解决的复杂问题。这就要求我们有计划、有步骤地对它们加以整顿，进一步贯彻执行民主办社和勤俭办社的方针，逐步地改善农业合作社的经营管理，妥善地调整社员之间、社员同社之间、社同国家之间的关系，不断地提高社员群众的社会主义觉悟，提高劳动生产率，增加生产，增加社员的收入。这样，经过三年五年的努力，我们一定能够从经济上、组织上和思想上把现有的农业生产合作社完全巩固起来，把农村中新的生产关系和新的社会秩序稳定下来。这是不断地发展农业生产的根本保证。
    我国农业生产战线上正在涌现出越来越多的先进生产者。党和政府应当把他们看做国家和人民的宝贵财富。刘少奇同志代表中共中央在去年4月30日全国先进生产者代表会议上的祝词中说过：“先进生产者是社会和国家的领导力量的不可缺少的组成部分；没有先进生产者，也就不可能有完全正确的领导。”应当承认，按照社会主义原则实行集体的农业大生产，对于我们来说还是一项新的事业。任何领导者、任何劳动模范和积极分子，要想带领广大群众做好这个事业，要避免或减少错误，就必须防止骄傲自满和虚夸的情绪，坚决地贯彻执行群众路线，遇事多同群众商量，多多地向群众学习。近年来农业生产领导上的一条宝贵的经验就是：哪里在领导生产上认真执行了群众路线，哪里就真正获得了增产；反过来，哪里忽视了群众路线，哪里的生产领导就犯了这样或那样的错误，给群众和国家造成损失。我们希望各地劳动模范和积极分子们，在任何时候都要十分注意保持谦虚和密切联系群众的优良作风。只有这样才能永远进步。
    劳动模范同志们！今年的春耕快要来到了。党和政府希望你们经过这次会议，交流经验，互相鼓励，更好地带动广大农民群众，以更大的信心和更高的热情，掀起一个更大规模的农业增产运动，全力争取在1957年得到一个大丰收！
