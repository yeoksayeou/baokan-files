    Striving to Overcome Difficulties in Raw Material Shortages
    Paper Industry Bureau Exceeds January Production Plan
    (Our Newspaper News) The enterprises under the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry overcame the difficulties of raw material shortages and exceeded the January production plan. For the bureau as a whole, paper production reached 103.5% of the plan (newsprint reached 106.6%), cardboard production reached 102.7%, and pulp production reached 105.1%.
    The reason why the enterprises under the Paper Industry Bureau were able to exceed the January plan was mainly because the factory leaders focused on material supply. For example, the director of the Yingkou Paper Mill personally went to northern Manchuria to purchase reeds, and the Tianjin Paper Mill transferred more than a dozen section chiefs and higher-level cadres to purchase materials in various places. In order to overcome the difficulty of fuel shortages, the Jilin and Tianjin factories shoveled up topsoil (which originally had coal slag and ash mixed in) and mixed it with coal for burning; at the same time, they saved coal for heating workshops and used it for production instead. In addition, factories in Jinzhou, Yingkou, and Andong adopted appropriate measures to reduce the whiteness of reed pulp, thereby reducing the consumption of bleaching powder. Secondly, the active assistance of local Party and government leadership departments in solving the difficulties of raw material procurement and transportation for paper mills was also an important reason for exceeding the January plan. For example, when the Tianjin and Jinzhou factories had difficulty in fuel supply, they received a lot of help from the local Party and government leadership departments.
    Although the January production plan of the paper industry has been exceeded from the overall point of view, the completion of the plan is still uneven in terms of enterprises and varieties. The pulping tasks of the Shixian and Kaishantun factories were not completed, and the papermaking tasks of the Anhui, 601, 602, and Hanyang factories were not completed; the production plans for sulfate wood pulp, cement bag paper, and cigarette paper of the entire bureau were not completed. These enterprises should strive to catch up in February. At the same time, continuing to overcome the difficulty of raw material shortages is still a key issue in future production. At present, the inventory of each factory is lower than in the past. In addition to continuing to focus on material supply, each enterprise should first pay special attention to saving raw materials. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to opening up new sources of raw materials and using materials such as wheat straw, rice straw, and sorghum stalks for pulping.

    努力克服原材料不足的困难
    造纸局超额完成一月份生产计划
    本报讯　轻工业部造纸工业管理局所属企业克服原材料不足的困难，超额完成了1月份生产计划。就全局来说，纸张生产完成103.5％（其中新闻纸完成106.6％），纸板生产完成102.7％，纸浆生产完成105.1％。
    造纸局所属企业所以能够超额完成1月份计划，主要是因为各厂领导方面抓紧了材料供应工作。如营口造纸厂厂长亲自到北满去采办苇子，天津造纸厂抽调了十多名科长级以上干部到各地采购。吉林、天津两厂为了克服燃料不足的困难，把地皮土（原来有煤渣煤灰混在里边）铲起来掺在煤里烧；同时，节省车间取暖用煤，把它用到生产中去。此外如锦州、营口、安东三厂采取适当降低苇浆白度的办法，减少漂白粉的消耗。其次，各地党、政领导部门积极协助造纸厂解决原料采购和运输的困难，也是超额完成1月份计划的一个重要原因。如天津、锦州两厂在燃料供应不上的时候，曾得到当地党政领导部门的多方帮助。
    造纸工业1月份生产计划虽然从全局来说已经超额完成，但是，就企业和品种说，完成计划的情况还是不平衡的。石岘、开山屯两厂的造浆任务没有完成，安徽、六○一、六○二、汉阳等厂的造纸任务没有完成；全局硫酸盐木浆、水泥袋纸和卷烟纸的生产计划都没有完成。这些企业在2月份应该努力赶上。同时，继续克服原材料不足的困难，还是今后生产中一个带关键性的问题。目前，各厂库存都比过去减少了，各个企业除了继续抓紧材料供应工作外，首先应当特别重视节约原材料。同时，还要注意开辟新的原料来源，利用麦秸、稻草、高粱秆等材料造浆。
