    Production Teams That Are Too Large Should Be Appropriately Reduced
    (Our report) The one-year practice of the Shifen Township Agricultural Cooperative in Longyan County, Fujian, shows that the production team should not be too large or too small, with twenty to thirty households being the best size.
    In the winter of 1955, the cooperative's committee divided the entire cooperative of 380 households into six large production brigades, each brigade including 60 to 80 member households, further divided into several cultivation groups, implementing brigade-level contracting for work and output. This was indeed beneficial for the unified allocation of labor, but contradictions also arose: First, work became chaotic, with group leaders and members waiting for the brigade leader to assign tasks every day, resulting in widespread lateness, early departures, loafing, and shoddy work; Second, specific problems could not be handled in a timely manner. For example, grading fertilizer took seven or eight households arguing for the better part of a day without any resolution; Third, due to the increased layers of management, the cooperative's leadership could not deeply engage with the masses and promptly identify problems.
    After the autumn harvest last year, the cooperative committee summarized the experiences and lessons learned in labor organization over the past year and decided to abolish the large production brigades. Based on the original thirty-plus cultivation groups, and considering terrain and neighborly relations, they were divided into fourteen production teams, each with twenty to thirty households. Several months of practice have proven that this team size is neither too large nor too small, making it easy for leadership to manage, and labor allocation is not difficult, resulting in a universal increase in labor efficiency. In 1955, the Third Production Brigade squeezed thirty or forty people together to carry out winter planting, with very low efficiency, spending more than 500 workdays to plant sixty mu of wheat. Last November, this brigade was divided into two production teams, implementing contracting for work and output, and labor quotas were established. Only 220-plus workdays were needed to plant all 103 mu of wheat, and the time was also shortened by five days compared to 1955. Adjusting the production organization also promoted closer ties between cooperative cadres and the masses, enabling them to solve problems in production in a timely manner.

### 生产队过大的应该适当缩小

    生产队过大的应该适当缩小
    本报讯　福建龙岩县石粉乡农业社一年的实践表明：生产队不宜过大过小，二十至三十户最好。
    1955年冬季社务委员会把全社三百八十户编为六个生产大队，每个大队包括六十至八十户社员，下分几个耕作小组，实行大队包工包产。这样对统一调配劳力确有好处，但矛盾也产生了：一、干起活来一窝蜂，小组长、社员每天等大队长分派工作，迟出早归、窝工、偷工现象普遍发生；二、处理具体问题不及时，例如评定肥料等级，七、八十户吵了大半天，也没个结果；三、由于层次增加，社的领导不能深入群众，及时发现问题。
    去年秋收以后，社务委员会总结了一年来劳动组织方面的经验教训，决定撤销生产大队，以原来的三十多个耕作小组为基础，根据地形和照顾亲邻友好关系，划分为十四个生产队，每队二十多户到三十户。经过几个月的实践证明：这样的队不大不小，领导很好掌握，调配劳力也不感到困难，劳动效率普遍提高。1955年第三生产大队三、四十个人挤在一起搞冬种，效率很低，种六十亩小麦花了五百多个工。去年11月，这个大队划分为二个生产队，实行包工包产，又制订了劳动定额，一百零三亩麦子只做二百二十多个工就全部种下了，时间也比1955年缩短了五天。调整生产组织，也促使社干部密切联系群众，及时解决生产中的问题。
