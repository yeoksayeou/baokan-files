    Discussion of the Geological Structure Map of China
    At the academic report sessions of the Second National Congress of Chinese Geological Society Members on the 7th and 9th, geologists discussed the Geological Structure Map of China, tentatively prepared by geologist Zhang Wenyou and his collaborators.
    The geological structure map divides regional units according to the changes in the historical development of the Earth's crust. From the division of these units, it can be roughly inferred that iron ore, oil fields, or other rare metal mineral deposits may exist in those areas. It has a certain guiding role in judging the prospects of mineral deposits. The compilation of geological structure maps is of great significance in both the theory and practice of geological science.
    Li Siguang was the first Chinese geologist to compile a geological structure map of China, which he compiled in 1929 while lecturing in the United Kingdom. After 1945, Huang Jiqing and other geologists also compiled them separately. Li Siguang focused on explaining the changes in the Earth's crust morphology from the analytical method of geomechanics. Huang Jiqing mostly studied the changes in the Earth's crust from the historical process of geological changes. Zhang Wenyou, etc., used some of their respective methods to compile this structure map based on existing geological data. The historical changes of the Chinese geosyncline (that is, the geological structure unit with a greater degree of activity) can be seen on this structure map.
    During the discussion of Zhang Wenyou's geological structure map, some people raised different views on his research methods and the division of structural units. Zhang Wenyou stated that he would solicit more opinions from the geological community before making revisions.
    Geological structure is a new science widely studied by international geologists, and there are many controversial issues. In China's geological circles, there are still many scientists who have achieved success in this area. Li Siguang, a famous Chinese geologist, analyzed the geological structure morphology from a mechanical point of view and systematized it, which is a first in the development of geology. His research results have attracted the attention of international geologists, and some countries have even organized geological experts to study his theory. Li Siguang has become a new school of geomechanics in geological structure in the international geological community. Huang Jiqing is known for studying crustal movement using geological history analysis methods. In recent years, many Chinese geologists have conducted extensive research on geological structure in various parts of the country in conjunction with geological exploration. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国大地构造图的讨论
    在中国地质学会第二次全国会员代表大会7日和9日的学术报告会上，地质学家们对地质学家张文佑及其合作者试制成的中国大地构造图进行了讨论。
    大地构造图根据地壳历史发展的变化来划分地区单位，从这些单位的划分上，大体上可以初步推测出在那些地区上可能有铁矿、油田或其它稀有金属矿藏。对判断矿藏的远景具有一定的指导作用。编制大地构造图在地质科学的理论上和实践上都有很大的意义。
    我国地质学家中第一个编制中国大地构造图的是李四光，他是1929年在英国讲学时编制的。1945年以后，黄汲清和其它的地质学家也曾经分别编制过。李四光着重从地质力学的分析方法来解释地壳形态的变化。黄汲清多从大地变迁的历史过程来研究地壳的变化。张文佑等分别采用他们两人的某些方法，就现有的地质资料编制出这个构造图。在这个构造图上可以看出中国地槽（即活动程度较大的大地构造单位）的历史变化。
    在讨论张文佑的大地构造图时，有的人对他的研究方法和构造单位的划分提出了不同的看法。张文佑表示他将更广泛地征求地质学界的意见后再进行修改。
    大地构造是国际地质学家们广泛研究的一门新的科学，其中争论的问题很多。在我国地质学界中，这方面有成就的科学家还是比较多的。我国著名地质学家李四光根据力学观点分析大地构造形态，并把它加以系统化，这在地质学发展中尚属首创。他的这一研究结果，已经引起国际地质学家的注意，在有些国家中还专门组织地质专家研究他的学说。李四光已经在国际地质学界中成为大地构造学中的地质力学的新学派。黄汲清是以研究地壳运动采用地质历史分析的方法而知名的。近年来，我国许多地质学家曾分别在全国各地结合着地质勘探，广泛地进行对大地构造的研究工作。　（新华社）
