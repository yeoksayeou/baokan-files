Soviet Science and Technology News

    Interplanetary Television Rocket
    Soviet scientists are planning to launch rockets carrying television transmitters to the Moon, Mars, and Venus. When the rockets fly close to these planets, the television transmitters will send images of these planets back to Earth.
    Soviet scientist Slepkevich said that this interplanetary television rocket will have no passengers and will be remotely controlled by people on Earth via radio. Transmitting images over such a large distance is currently a "difficult problem," but Slepkevich believes that this plan could be realized between 1962 and 1967.
    Telescopic Spectacles
    The Soviet Union has recently manufactured a very strange pair of glasses. It is not made of single-sided lenses, but is based on the principle of a telescope, using lenses of various degrees in combination. It can not only adjust the distance, but also magnify the object to be viewed by 1.8 times. If needed, a top hat attached to the front of the lens barrel can be used to magnify the object to be viewed even further.
    This type of glasses was specially created by the Soviet National Helmholtz Eye Disease Scientific Research Institute for people with extremely weak vision due to trauma, congenital defects, malignant myopia, and optic nerve atrophy. For such people, even the best ordinary glasses are of no use. However, with these special glasses, they can read newspapers and resume normal work.
    Exposure of 2.5 Millionths of a Second
    The Moscow Institute of Chemical Physics recently manufactured a photographic device that can perform exposures of 2.5 millionths of a second and can photograph any object within about ten kilometers. As everyone knows, ordinary cameras have an exposure of only one thousandth of a second.
    This photographic device is able to take pictures at such a high speed because it has a special shutter that uses optical principles. This shutter is composed of a special set of lenses and a mirror that rotates at high speed.
    This high-speed camera can help physicists investigate and study phenomena such as nuclear reactions, electrical discharges, and the combustion process of gas mixtures in jet engines. At present, some Soviet coal mines have begun to use this new photographic equipment to study methods of preventing coal mine explosions.
    Automatic Diamond Sorter
    The Soviet Union has created an automatic diamond sorter. It can increase the efficiency of diamond selection by workers in diamond mines by 15 times.
    The automatic diamond sorter is based on the principle discovered by Soviet Academician Vavilov that uncut diamonds emit flashes under X-ray irradiation. When a rock containing diamonds is irradiated by the sorter's X-rays, it emits a light. This light is absorbed by a photoelectric tube, which emits a signal to a special device. This device immediately sends it to a special container. If the rock does not contain diamonds, this series of actions will not occur. The rock is then discarded.

    苏联科学技术消息
    星际电视火箭
    苏联科学家们正在计划向月亮、火星和金星放射装着电视放送机的火箭，当火箭飞近那些星球的时候，电视放送机就能把这些星球上的形象送回地球。
    苏联科学家斯勒普凯维奇说，这个星际电视火箭上没有乘客，它将由人们在地球上用无线电操纵。电视要在这样大的距离内传送形象，目前还是一个“难题”，不过斯勒普凯维奇认为在1962年到1967年之间，这个计划就有可能实现。
    望远镜式的眼镜
    苏联最近制造了一种很奇怪的眼镜。它不是用单面镜片制成，而是根据望远镜的原理，用各种不同度数的镜片配合而成的。它不仅能够调整距离，而且能够把要看的东西放大到一点八倍。如果需要还可以利用镜筒前附加的一个顶帽，把所要看的东西再放大一些。
    这种眼镜是苏联国立格尔姆戈尔茨眼病科学研究所专门为一些由于外伤、先天的缺陷、恶性近视和视神经萎缩而视力极度微弱的人创制的。对这种人来说，即使最好的普通眼镜也无济于事。但是，有了这种特别的眼镜，他们就能读书看报，恢复正常的劳动了。
    二百五十万分之一秒的曝光
    莫斯科化学物理学研究所不久前制造的一种摄影设备能够进行二百五十万分之一秒的曝光，而且能够拍摄约十公里以内的任何物体。大家知道，一般的照像机只有千分之一秒的曝光。
    这种摄影设备所以能够以这样快的速度照像是因为它有一个特别的利用光学原理的快门，这种快门是一套特殊的透镜和一面以高速旋转的镜子组成的。
    这种高速照像机可以帮助物理学家调查和研究核子反应、放电和喷气发动机中气体混合物燃烧过程等现象。目前，苏联一些煤矿已经开始采用这种新的摄影设备来研究预防煤矿爆炸的方法。
    钻石自动选拣机
    苏联创制了一种钻石自动选拣机。它可以使开采钻石的工人选钻石的效率提高十五倍。
    钻石自动选拣机是根据苏联瓦维洛夫院士所发现的未经琢磨的钻石在X射线照射下会发闪光的原理制成的。当一块含钻石的岩石受到选拣机的X射线照射的时候，便会发出一种光线，这种光线被光电管所吸收发出一个信号给一个特别装置，这个装置就立刻会把它送到一个专门的容器内。如果岩石内不含钻石，这一系列的动作就不会发生。岩石便被抛弃掉。
