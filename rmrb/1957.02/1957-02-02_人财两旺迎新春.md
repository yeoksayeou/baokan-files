    Welcoming the New Spring with Prosperous People and Wealth
                                    Zhu Xianzong
    On the eve of the Spring Festival, on the south bank of the Nemor River in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, the peasants who had reaped their first bumper harvest since the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives were happily preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival. Immigrant Dong Chengyou was happier than anyone else. All seven members of his family had new clothes. The house was plastered white and looked brand new. He had just slaughtered a big, fat pig. Besides freezing the meat that couldn't be eaten right away, he picked out the fatty parts to prepare dumplings and the lean parts to make dishes. Ever since the cooperative harvested the rice, he had been able to eat half rice every meal. Recently, he had ground some good rice to eat during the festival. He said in front of the villagers, "I'm really lucky to have come to this blessed land. In my first year in the Great Northern Wilderness, I've had both prosperous people and wealth!"
    The "prosperous people and wealth" that Dong Chengyou was talking about were these: In April of last year, he came from Shandong Province to the Great Northern Wilderness and settled down in the Youli Agricultural Cooperative in Lumin Township, Nehe County. Soon after arriving, his wife gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl. This was originally the first happy event for him after coming to the Great Northern Wilderness, but he turned it into a cause for worry. The reason was that he was already fifty-two years old and couldn't do heavy work. The three children he had before were not big, and only the eldest daughter could help a little. His wife was also tied up with the children and couldn't get away. His family's life was already difficult, and now with the addition of more people, the burden was even heavier. So, he and his wife discussed it and decided to give the newborn children away. When the cooperative members found out, they went to comfort them,劝 them not to give the children away, and said that everyone would help them overcome their difficulties. After the cooperative members took action, they sent them more than a hundred eggs, as well as some rice and cash, for Dong Chengyou's wife to eat during her confinement period, and helped solve the problem of feeding the children. Dong Chengyou said movedly, "You are so enthusiastic towards me. This is all thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao. I must work hard and build a home and career in the Great Northern Wilderness!"
    In the past, this place suffered from floods year after year. After the establishment of the advanced cooperative last year, the river water was utilized, and some of the dry land was converted into paddy fields. Based on Dong Chengyou's weak health and lack of knowledge of local production techniques, the cooperative assigned him to do light work. He worked very hard and also let his eldest daughter, Dong Sixiang, participate in production. In the first year of running the advanced cooperative, the whole cooperative had a bumper harvest of both paddy fields and dry land, averaging 5,500 jin of grain per hectare, surpassing any year in local history. The remuneration for each labor day reached more than four yuan. Dong Chengyou and his daughter earned a total of more than 2,600 work points, with an income of more than 1,100 yuan, an increase of more than five times compared to 1955 in Shandong Province. His family, besides keeping enough food and sewing new clothes, also bought a new house.
    Now Dong Chengyou's twin children are growing very well. He named the boy "Baoguo" (Protect the Country) and the girl "Nehai" (Ne River Child). He explained, "The main reason why I can achieve both prosperous people and wealth is because we have a good country. In the future, I will educate my son to grow up and defend the motherland. I came to the Great Northern Wilderness and live right along the Nemor River. This is a good place to get rich. I will educate my daughter to love this place when she grows up. We will live here forever and build the frontier of the motherland!"

    人财两旺迎新春
                朱显忠
    春节前夕，黑龙江省讷河县讷谟尔河南岸，获得农业高级合作化以后第一个丰收年的农民们，都在欢欢乐乐地准备过春节。移民董成有比谁都快乐。全家七口人，都穿上了新衣服。屋里糊得洁白如新。新宰一口大肥猪，除把一时吃不了的肉用冰冻起来以外，挑出肥的准备包饺子，瘦的准备作菜。他自从社里打下稻子以来，平常都能吃一半大米饭，最近又磨了一些好大米，准备过节吃。他当着屯里人说：“我这回算落到福地了，来北大荒头一年就闹的人财两旺！”
    董成有所说的“人财两旺”，原来是这样的：去年4月，他从山东省来到北大荒，在讷河县鲁民乡有利农业社落了户。来后不久，他老伴一胎生了一男一女。这本来是他到北大荒以后的第一件喜事，但是他却把它当成了忧愁。原因是他已经五十二岁了，不能干硬活。以前生的三个孩子都不大，只有大女儿还能帮助一把子。老伴又被孩子缠的脱不开身。他家生活本来就很困难，现在添了人口，负担更加沉重了。于是，他和老伴合计好，准备把新生的两个小孩送给别人。社员们知道了，便去安慰他们，劝他们不要把小孩送给人，并且表示大家要帮助他们克服困难。社员们一活动，就给他们送去一百多个鸡蛋，还有一些大米和现款，给董成有的老伴坐月子吃用，同时帮助解决了小孩的吃奶问题。董成有感动地说：“你们对我这样热心，这都是毛主席领导的好。我一定要好好干，在北大荒安家立业！” 
    过去，这里连年遭受水灾。去年建立高级社以后，把河水利用起来，一部分旱地改成了水田。社里根据董成有身体弱、不懂当地生产技术的情况，给他分配做轻便活。他很努力干，并且让大女儿董四香也参加生产。办高级社头一年，全社水田、旱地都丰收，平均每公顷打粮食五千五百斤，超过当地历史上任何一年，每个劳动日的报酬达四元多。董成有爷女俩共挣两千六百多工分，收入一千一百多元，比1955年在山东省的时候增加收入五倍多。他家除留下足够的口粮、缝制新衣等外，还买了一间新房。
    现在董成有的双生小孩长得很好，他给男孩起名叫“保国”，给女孩起名叫“讷孩”。他解释说：“我所以能够闹上人财两旺，主要是有了好国家。以后我要教育我的儿子，长大了去保卫祖国。我来北大荒，正好住在讷谟尔河沿上，这是发财致富的好地方。我要教育我的女儿，长大了热爱这个地方。我们要永远在这里生活下去，建设祖国的边疆！”
