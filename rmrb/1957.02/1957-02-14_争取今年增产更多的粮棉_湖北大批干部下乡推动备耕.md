In order to strive for greater increases in grain and cotton production this year, rural areas throughout Hubei Province are intensifying preparations for spring planting, struggling to produce 22.5 billion jin of grain and 4.4 million dan of ginned cotton this year.

During the winter production campaign, members of agricultural cooperatives in various locations broke ice to repair ponds and braved snow to accumulate fertilizer. To date, the Xiangyang Special District has completed approximately 80% of its farmland irrigation and water conservancy tasks, while the Jingzhou Special District has completed 70% of its fertilizer accumulation tasks for this winter and spring. Counties such as Huanggang, Macheng, Xinzhou, Luotian, Qichun, Huangmei, Yangxin, Daye, and Echeng have accumulated more than 600 million dan of various natural fertilizers.

After the Spring Festival, Party committees throughout Hubei Province organized work teams to go to the countryside to investigate spring planting preparations. The Enshi Prefectural Party Committee selected seven members of the Prefectural Party Committee to lead 79 cadres to the countryside. The Huanggang County Party Committee also dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to assist township and cooperative cadres in their work. The Jingzhou Special District's counties separately convened meetings of guidance team leaders and township branch secretaries from various townships to summarize and inspect winter production work and make comprehensive arrangements for spring planting preparations. The Provincial Department of Agriculture has also prepared 12,000 tons of pesticides (double the amount from last year) and 60,000 tons of chemical fertilizers (5,000 tons more than last year) for the large-scale spring planting.

According to typical investigations in various locations, Hubei Province's spring planting preparations this year were made earlier and are better than in previous years. However, some agricultural cooperatives have not yet adequately prepared agricultural tools and production funds. In addition, due to heavy snowfall last winter, the progress of water conservancy work has been relatively slow. Currently, Party committees in various locations are assisting agricultural cooperatives in solving these problems. (Hubei Daily Editorial Department)

    争取今年增产更多的粮棉
    湖北大批干部下乡推动备耕
    本报讯　湖北省各地农村正加紧春耕生产的准备工作，为今年生产二百二十五亿斤粮食和四百四十万担皮棉而斗争。
    在冬季生产运动中，各地农业社社员破冰修塘，冒雪积肥。到目前为止，襄阳专区已完成了兴修农田水利任务80％左右，荆州专区完成去冬今春积肥任务70％，如黄冈、麻城、新洲、罗田、圻春、黄梅、阳新、大冶、鄂城等县已积了各种自然肥料六亿多担。
    春节过后，湖北省各地党委组织了工作组下乡调查备耕工作。恩施地委抽调了七个地委委员带领七十九个干部下乡；黄冈县委也抽调了大批干部下乡帮助乡社干部工作；荆州专区各县分别召开了各乡的指导组长和乡支部书记会议，总结检查冬季生产工作，和全面安排了春耕准备工作。省农业厅也为大规模的春耕生产准备了一万二千吨农药（比去年增加一倍）和六万吨化学肥料（比去年增加五千吨）。
    根据各地典型调查，湖北省今年备耕工作作得比往年早，也比往年好；但有些农业社对农具、生产资金还没有作好准备；再加上去冬多雪，水利工作进度也较迟缓。目前，各地党委正在帮助各农业社解决这些问题。（湖北日报编辑部）
