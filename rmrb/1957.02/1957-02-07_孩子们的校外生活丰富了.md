Children's Extracurricular Life Enriched
	Dai Yue

Beijing is paying great attention to the extracurricular education of primary and secondary school students. Recently, the People's Congress meetings held in Beijing and its districts have included the issue of children's extracurricular education as one of the agenda items, discussed it, and made decisions. The Municipal Education Bureau has also made a decision on strengthening the political and ideological and moral character education of primary and secondary school students, proposing many measures to improve extracurricular education. Now, most schools in Beijing have full-time counselors to guide students' extracurricular activities.

Many cinemas have added children's screenings, and a children's cinema has recently been renovated with the support of more than twenty units throughout the city. Some parks are preparing to open to children for free, and the Working People's Cultural Palace has opened children's activity venues and established an extracurricular counseling team. Some museums have also opened to children. Cultural centers (stations) in various districts, neighborhood committees, and families also have facilities for children's extracurricular activities. Thanks to the efforts of all parties, rich and varied extracurricular activities for children can now be seen everywhere.

	A Group of Little Musicians

When school is dismissed at the Maxian Hutong Primary School in Dongdan District, one often sees a group of children carrying various musical instruments, blowing trumpets, playing the erhu, and playing various songs while walking towards the "Children's Home."

This group of little national musicians are some of the students in the fifth and sixth grades. In the past, they had nothing to do during most of the half-day when the two-part system was in effect, so they wandered the streets, visited shops, some smoked and drank, and went to empty places to fight. After the school discovered this situation, they introduced them to the "Children's Home" to participate in various activities. The comrades at the "Children's Home" also cared about them very much.

Now, these children have become active members of the school in carrying out extracurricular activities.

	Children's Paradise

The Dongdan District Cultural Center has converted most of its space into a paradise for children. The service staff of this paradise are students in the first and second grades of junior high school and the fifth and sixth grades of elementary school from various middle and primary schools. The paradise has a music room, a recreation room, and a reading room. It attracts many enthusiasts of various activities. An hour before the park opens every day, several neat lines have already formed in front of the door. In the park, children can perform, read, and participate in various other activities. The comrades of the Cultural Center have also organized a slide show team of more than twenty people according to the children's hobbies. Now they are preparing to perform "The Fisherman and the Goldfish Story" in the form of dialogue narration. This kind of activity not only enriches the children's knowledge of science and literature, but also enables them to serve everyone, and also cultivates children's good moral character.

	Family Groups

In most primary schools in Beijing, all kinds of family groups have been established, some studying, some listening to the radio, and some participating in some household chores. These groups have played a certain role in children's education. Ji Zhiwei's family group is one example.

Ji Zhiwei's mother not only loves her own children, but also loves other people's children. She felt that Ji Zhiwei was a little lonely studying at home alone. At the same time, she saw that some children's homes were too small to study well, so she vacated a room in her house for the students to use. In this way, seven students came together and formed a study and radio listening group. Every day, Ji Zhiwei's mother cleaned the house spotlessly, arranged tables and chairs, and prepared boiled water for the children. The children review their lessons and listen to children's broadcasts every day after two o'clock in the afternoon. In addition, they also help their mother wash clothes, mend socks, and clean up the house, which makes the parents very happy.

Ji Zhiwei's mother also often encourages students with better grades to help those with poorer grades. Chang Yonghai's academic performance used to be often two points. After he joined this group, the team members often helped him. He not only eliminated the two points, but also wore a red scarf. Since then, this group has become a red scarf group.

Satisfying Children's Hobbies

Pudu Temple Primary School is a small school with a small number of students. The students do not have activity venues, but extracurricular activities are very active. The school has organized various extracurricular activity groups according to the different hobbies of the students. The students in the plant group plant various flowers and plants in the open space around the school buildings every spring, and carefully record the growth of the flowers and plants in small notebooks every day; the children in the animal group raise rabbits.

Some of the students at Kuijia Factory Primary School like to play the harmonica the most, so the teacher invited two students from the Twenty-Sixth Middle School who play the harmonica well to teach them. These two little teachers are very enthusiastic and come to teach every Wednesday afternoon. The harmonica team has increased from a dozen people to more than one hundred and forty people. Now they can play many songs and have won the third prize in the Beijing Children's Art Festival.

	Broad Activity Garden

Everywhere in Beijing, you can see children's activity gardens. The Dongdan District Workers' Club is open to children for free, and children can carry out a variety of activities there. Many cinemas have also added children's screenings, showing films suitable for children to watch. Some cinemas explain the content of the film to the children before the performance in order to help them understand the content of the film. The children on the skating rink, wearing wooden ice skates made by the "Children's Home" and the school, are carrying out ice sports. Many Young Pioneers can happily spend their team day in the park. During this year's winter vacation, many schools turned classrooms into game rooms and reading rooms, and many teachers sacrificed their rest time to provide extracurricular tutoring to the children at school. Some neighborhood committees have also set up book stations for the children in the streets, and the children are responsible for borrowing and lending.

The extracurricular activities of children in Beijing are relatively rich, but there are still some problems. Although there are several "Children's Homes," and some of them have relatively good conditions, because there are no counselors, many activities cannot be carried out, and the potential of the equipment has not been well utilized; some schools do not pay enough attention to the work of family groups, and some family groups have disbanded due to lack of guidance after their establishment. These problems still need to be solved by the relevant parties.

    孩子们的校外生活丰富了	戴月
    北京市各个方面非常重视中、小学生的校外教育。最近，北京市、区召开的人民代表大会会议上，都把孩子们的校外教育问题列为会议议程之一，进行了讨论并作出了决定。市教育局也作了关于加强中、小学生政治思想和道德品质教育的决定，提出了许多改进校外教育的措施，现在北京市大部分学校都设了专职辅导员，指导学生们的课外活动。
    许多电影院增加了儿童场，最近在全市二十多个单位的支援下改建成了一所儿童电影院。有些公园正在准备免费为儿童开放，劳动人民文化宫开辟了儿童活动场所，并成立了校外辅导工作组。有的博物馆也为孩子们开放了。各区的文化馆（站）、居民委员会和家庭里也都有了孩子们的校外活动的设备。由于各方面的努力，现在处处可以看到孩子们丰富多采的校外活动。
      一群小音乐家
    东单区麻线胡同小学放学的时候，经常看到一群孩子拿着各种乐器，一边走一边吹着喇叭，拉着二胡，奏着各种歌曲，走向“少年之家”。
    这群小国乐家是五、六年级的一部分学生。过去二部制空闲下的大半天时间，他们没事可干，就逛街、串商店，有的抽烟、喝酒，到空地方去打架。学校发现这种情况后，便把他们介绍到“少年之家”去参加各种活动。“少年之家”的同志也很关心他们。
    现在，这些孩子已经成为学校开展课外活动的积极分子。
        儿童乐园
    东单区文化馆用馆内大部分地方为孩子们改建了一所乐园。这个乐园的服务员由各个中、小学校初中一、二年级和小学五、六年级的学生担任。乐园里辟有音乐室、游艺室、阅览室等。它吸引着许多各种活动的爱好者，每天开园的前一个钟头，门前已经排成了整整齐齐的好几个队。在乐园里，孩子们可以进行演奏、阅读等各种活动。文化馆的同志还根据孩子们的爱好，组织了个二十多人的幻灯队。现在他们正准备用对话解说形式演出“渔夫和金鱼的故事”。这种活动不仅丰富了孩子们的科学、文学方面的知识，而且能为大家服务，也培养了孩子们良好的道德品质。
        家庭小组
    在北京的绝大部分小学里都成立了各种各样的家庭小组，有的温书，有的收听广播，有的参加一部分家务劳动。这些小组对孩子的教育都起了一定的作用。计志伟的家庭小组就是一例。
    计志伟的母亲不但爱自己的孩子，而且也爱别人的孩子。她感到计志伟一个人在家温书有些寂寞，同时她看到有些孩子家里地方太小，不能好好学习，她便把自己家的房子腾出一间给学生们用。这样，就有七个学生结合在一起，成立了一个温书、收听广播小组。每天，计志伟的母亲把房子打扫得干干净净，摆好桌椅，还为孩子们准备好开水。孩子们每天下午两点以后温习功课，收听儿童广播。此外，他们还帮助妈妈洗衣服、缝补袜子、收拾屋子，家长都很高兴。
    计志伟的母亲还经常鼓励成绩较好的学生帮助成绩较差的。常永海过去学习成绩经常是两分，他参加这个小组以后，队员们经常帮助他。他不但消灭了两分，而且戴上了红领巾。从此，这个小组就成了红领巾小组了。
  满足孩子们的爱好
    普渡寺小学是个规模小、人数少的学校，学生们没有活动场地，但是课外活动却搞得很活跃。学校根据学生们不同的爱好，组织了各种课外活动小组。植物小组的学生每年春季在校舍周围的空地上种上各种花草，并且每天都认真地在小本子上记录着花草的成长情况；动物小组的孩子们饲养小兔子。
    盔甲厂小学有一部分学生最喜欢吹口琴，教师便请二十六中两位口琴吹得好的学生来教。这两位小先生很热心，每星期三下午来教，口琴队从十几个人增加到一百四十多人。现在他们都能吹奏好多曲子，曾经得过北京市儿童文艺会演三等奖。
    广阔的活动园地
    在北京处处可以看到孩子们的活动园地。东单区工人俱乐部为孩子们免费开放，孩子们可以在那里开展多种多样的活动。许多电影院也为孩子们增加了儿童场，演出适合孩子们看的影片。有的电影院为了使孩子们理解影片的内容，演出前给孩子们讲解影片的内容。在溜冰场上的孩子们，穿着“少年之家”和学校为孩子们制的木板冰鞋，开展冰上运动。许多少先队员可以愉快地在公园里过队日。今年寒假，许多学校都把教室变成了游艺室、阅览室，并且有许多教师牺牲了休息时间，在学校给孩子们作校外辅导。有的居民委员会也为街道的孩子们设了图书站，由孩子们自己担负借阅工作。
    北京市孩子们的校外活动比较丰富了，但是还有一些问题。“少年之家”虽有好几个，有的条件也比较好，因为没有辅导员，许多活动项目开展不起来，设备潜力也没有很好发挥；有的学校对家庭小组工作重视还不够，有些家庭小组成立后因缺乏指导又散了。这些问题，还需要有关方面加以解决。
