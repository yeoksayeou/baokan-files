    Happiness Brought by Cooperativization
    Left: In the Chaoyang Agricultural Cooperative of Handan City, Hebei Province, twenty-four households were originally helpless elderly people and children. In addition to the 80 yuan living expenses the agricultural cooperative gives them each year, they also receive care in many other ways. Granny Wei is already over seventy years old, and young female cooperative members often come to help her with sewing and mending. Photo by Li Yu (New China News Agency manuscript)
    Bottom Left: The Qinfen Agricultural Cooperative in Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, achieved a bumper harvest in the autumn after the merger of the Qinjian and Fendou elementary cooperatives into an advanced cooperative in the spring of last year. The average yield per mu was 600 jin, an increase of nearly 50% compared to 1955. In addition to the more than 130,000 yuan in sideline income, among the 142 households in the cooperative, the 26 households that previously lacked food no longer lack food, and the number of households with increased production reached more than 92%. The lives of the cooperative members have generally improved compared to before cooperativization.

    左下：甘肃省临夏回族自治州勤奋农业社在去年春季由勤俭、奋斗两个初级社合并转为高级社后，秋季获得丰收。平均每亩产粮六百斤，比1955年增产近50％；加上十三万多元的副业收入，全社一百四十二户中，过去有缺粮户二十六户，现在已没有一户缺粮了，增产户达到92％以上。社员们的生活较合作化前普遍提高。
