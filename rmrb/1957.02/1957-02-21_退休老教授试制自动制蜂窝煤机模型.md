Xinhua News Agency, 20th - On the 19th, Mr. Yan Ruo, a retired professor in Beijing, received several guests at his home: the director of the Beijing Municipal Coal Supply Office, the manager of the Coal Construction Company, and the director of the Mechanized Coal Briquette Factory. They visited the automatic honeycomb coal briquette machine model that the professor had recently successfully built. They told the professor, "We have long wanted to have such a machine, and we will strive to produce a machine based on this model and put it into production this year."

The machine model is one-eighth the size of the real thing. The professor demonstrated the production process to the guests. He mixed the wet coal, turned on the power, and the two coal pressing plates turned "ka-da, ka-da," and honeycomb coal briquettes, pressed like candies, immediately appeared on the conveyor belt. This machine can produce more than 40,000 honeycomb coal briquettes in eight hours, equivalent to the work of two hundred people. It is estimated that the cost of manufacturing a machine is only more than 4,000 yuan, while the molds used by two hundred workers cost more than 7,000 yuan.

Honeycomb coal is a coal briquette made of coal dust with honeycomb-like small holes on it. After being lit in the stove, it can burn for a long time without going out. Compared with coal balls, it saves both firewood and coal.

Last year, this old professor learned at an exhibition that the manual pressing of honeycomb coal briquettes was labor-intensive and had a low output, so he began to study making this machine, and it took him more than four months to successfully build it.

Mr. Yan Ruo is 75 years old this year and was formerly a professor in the Department of Crafts at Beijing Normal University. After retiring in 1951, he served as a consultant to the Beijing Municipal First Local Industry Bureau and still diligently studies various machines at home.

    退休老教授试制自动制蜂窝煤机模型
    新华社20日讯　19日，北京市一位退休老教授老炎若的家里来了几位客人——北京市煤炭供应办公室主任、煤建公司经理和机制煤球厂厂长，他们参观了老教授最近试制成功的自动制蜂窝煤机模型，告诉老教授说：我们早就想有这样的机器，争取今年根据这个模型制成机器投入生产。
    这台机器模型比实物小八分之一。老教授给客人表演了生产过程。他拌好湿煤，扭开电门，两个压煤盘卡达、卡达地转起来，传送带上立刻出现了压好的像糖果一般大的蜂窝煤。这台机器八小时可以制出四万多块蜂窝煤，等于两百个人的工作。据估计制造一台机器的费用只要四千多元，而两百个工人用的模具却要七千多元。
    蜂窝煤是煤末压成的上面带有蜂窝般小孔的煤块，在炉子内点着以后可以长时间不灭，比起煤球来，又省劈柴又省煤。
    这位老教授去年在一个展览会上了解到人工压制蜂窝煤，劳动强度大，产量小，他就开始研究作这台机器，经过四个多月才试制成功。
    老炎若今年七十五岁，原任北京师范大学工艺系教授。1951年退休以后，就担任了北京市第一地方工业局的顾问，平常在家里还孜孜不倦地研究各种机械。
