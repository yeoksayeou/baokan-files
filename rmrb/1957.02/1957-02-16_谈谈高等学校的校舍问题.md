Talking About the Dormitory Problems of Higher Education Institutions
Du Erqi

The number of newly built school buildings in the past seven years is 202% of the total in the fifty years before liberation – the so-called dormitory shortage mainly refers to the relative lack of dormitories – adopting the method of interspersed scheduling to improve the utilization rate of teaching rooms – more suitable houses should be built within the established funding range

The school buildings left by the old China were very few. In 1949, the total construction area of school buildings in national universities was only more than 3.7 million square meters. In the past seven years, nearly 80 schools have successively completed new construction and relocation tasks; all the original universities have also carried out expansion projects of varying scales or purchased school buildings. By the end of 1956, the number of school buildings in national universities had reached more than 11.2 million square meters. That is to say, in the seven years since liberation alone, the number of newly built school buildings in universities and colleges was 202% of the total built in the fifty years before liberation. The average annual construction speed after liberation is 14.5 times higher than before liberation. This fully reflects the Party and the government's concern for higher education.

However, with the development of the situation, many new problems have also emerged. Although the speed of increase in school buildings is fast, the number of students enrolled has increased even faster, which makes it easy to cause a disconnection between the development of the cause and the work of material guarantee. Before 1955, the development of the cause was relatively gradual, and some new construction projects could be completed in time. The original living quarters still had a certain potential to be exploited, and newly built, relocated schools and key schools could also be taken care of appropriately. Therefore, the issue of the number of school buildings was not prominent at that time, and it could basically guarantee the needs of the development of the cause. But in 1956, on the one hand, the enrollment task increased rapidly, and more than 2,000 students were temporarily over-enrolled, and some department adjustment plans were temporarily changed, and a number of teaching staff were newly added; on the other hand, due to the general lack of basic construction materials, insufficient construction force in some areas, and design data and design drawings could not be supplied in time, so that very few school buildings were completed and used at the beginning of the new semester; furthermore, because some schools and management units excessively increased the proportion of teaching rooms when formulating basic construction plans at the beginning of the year, resulting in a reduction in living quarters, a man-made tense situation arose; in addition, a group of graduates failed to be assigned in time that year, so after the start of school, many schools, especially some schools in several major cities where the enrollment task was relatively concentrated, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Chengdu, some school buildings were once very tight, and did affect the normal operation of teaching work to varying degrees.

However, further research shows that the so-called need for school buildings cannot keep up with the development of the cause, which mainly refers to the relative lack of student dormitories, followed by the relative lack of dormitories for general faculty and staff. At present, the living conditions in student dormitories in some schools are such that each person only occupies a living area of ​​2 to 2.5 square meters, and the lowest is only 1.7 square meters; according to statistics on the living conditions of 138 universities and colleges, the average number of households solving housing problems accounts for about 36% of the total number of faculty and staff, so these difficulties do exist. Due to past social conditions, almost all students and most faculty and staff require the state to solve the housing problem. Because the current urban living and traffic conditions are also very tense, it is difficult to emphasize the methods of implementing commuting and solving housing problems by oneself. Therefore, relevant units and schools, in order to jointly run the motherland's higher education cause well, try their best to gradually meet the requirements of the majority of people. In recent years, new dormitories and residences have been built every year, and the construction area in this regard has reached about 40% of the total school building area in the country. This proportion cannot be considered low. The main reason is that the development of the cause requires a lot, and temporary difficulties have occurred due to financial and material constraints. This can be explained to everyone. As long as we follow the spirit of running schools diligently and thriftily and sharing weal and woe, difficulties can be overcome. As for the teaching and related rooms, which account for about half of the school buildings in universities and colleges, the situation is different. In recent years, a lot of teaching rooms have been newly built, but the utilization rate of classrooms, laboratories, training factories and related ancillary rooms in many schools is very low. The average weekly use is below 30 class hours. Administrative and teaching administrative rooms in many schools occupy too much area; reading rooms and sports venues are sometimes very crowded and sometimes very empty; the cafeterias of schools with thousands of students still use a batch-eating method, resulting in extremely low utilization rates; and some welfare ancillary rooms also have uneven busy and idle phenomena. Obviously, the potential of these school buildings has not been brought into play.

Experience tells us that the main key to improving the utilization rate of teaching rooms and related school buildings lies in changing the scheduling method. Since the second half of 1954, a few schools have begun to explore, but some people say that it is not good to implement the interspersed scheduling method; others say that this is forced and it is best to continue to use the old single scheduling method. If we look at it from the point of view that "it is always better to have more houses than fewer houses" and "we don't need to use the interspersed scheduling method if the houses can be built", then that statement may be correct, but we cannot measure it in this way. Some people also believe that after adopting the interspersed scheduling method, "teaching effect will be affected" because of afternoon classes. I think the main factors affecting teaching effect are the number of teachers, the level of teachers, the content of teaching materials and teaching methods. The fact is often that even if classes are held in the morning, it is difficult to teach students well without good teachers and good teaching material content; with good teachers and good teaching material content, classes in the afternoon may not necessarily absolutely affect the teaching effect (of course, the summer lunch break time and the afternoon temperature being too high in some cities in the south need to be appropriately considered and arranged). Taking the utilization of school buildings at Tsinghua University and Peking University at the beginning of the first semester of the 1956-1957 academic year as an example, each of the two schools then added more than 2,000 students, but most of the basic construction tasks for that year were not completed. Except that Tsinghua University built 3,500 square meters of temporary classrooms and Peking University built about 2,000 square meters of temporary classrooms, the number of school buildings basically remained the same as in the previous semester. In order to solve the difficulty of having more people than houses, Tsinghua University and Peking University adopted the method of interspersed scheduling in separate departments, and the cafeteria adopted the system of batch rotation; sports activities were arranged in the morning and afternoon; and the reading room could be fully utilized all day long. Therefore, the utilization rate of their classrooms, basic course laboratories, reading rooms, cafeterias, sports venues and related ancillary rooms has been significantly improved. The average weekly utilization rate of classrooms at Tsinghua University has generally reached 45 to 55 class hours, and the highest can reach 62 class hours; the average utilization rate of classrooms at Peking University has also reached 46 class hours. The fact that the number of students has increased significantly and these school buildings have basically not been added shows that the economic effect of adopting the interspersed scheduling method is certain. Now the teaching management department of Tsinghua University is further studying the scheduling method and believes that the summer lunch break time can be appropriately arranged after implementing the interspersed scheduling in separate departments. Of course, it is undeniable that the scheduling problem is a complex problem, involving the arrangement of all courses and the activities of all teachers, students and staff; it also involves regional conditions and old school building conditions, etc., and it should not and cannot be required that all schools adopt the same interspersed scheduling method. The main issue is that while building school buildings to ensure teaching needs, we must actively and as much as possible improve their utilization rate.

The quality of school buildings should first of all be considered in the principle of economy and applicability, which is conducive to the learning, work and life of students and teachers, and the building structure and decoration should be solid, durable, simple and elegant. Since the expansion and new construction of universities and colleges, many design units, construction departments and schools have worked together to build more suitable school buildings with a small amount of funds. However, before 1954, due to the high cost standards set, some schools and design departments inappropriately raised the building quality standards, and then adopted high-level structures, luxurious decorations, spacious and overly elaborate entrances and corridors, expensive equipment, and large roofs with flying eaves and beasts, which could be not adopted. This kind of design that deviates from the current national economic level and inappropriately raises the construction quality or carries out waste is very wrong and lessons should be learned from it. After the implementation of comprehensive savings in 1955, universities and colleges across the country and relevant design departments saved the country more than 35 million yuan in school building construction projects. This achievement is certain. However, many school building projects have also produced a phenomenon of one-sided "savings", ignoring the minimum quality requirements. Obviously, this phenomenon of one-sided "savings", which loses sight of the big picture for the sake of small gains, is also wrong, and we should also learn lessons from it. However, some schools have recently shown excessive demands when formulating the 1957 plan.

In short, on the issue of school building quality, school building quality standards and cost indicators should be formulated based on the current national economic conditions, based on the principle of opposing both extravagance and waste and opposing one-sided "savings". Combined with the current situation that the development of school buildings cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the cause, the main problem is still the number of school buildings. Therefore, all schools should consider building more suitable houses within the established funding range.

The biggest feature of the requirements of universities and colleges for the completion time of construction is the hope that all or most of the construction projects can be completed and used before the start of the new autumn semester. Especially in the current situation where the basic construction plan tasks for the current year can only meet the enrollment task requirements for the current year, there is this requirement, otherwise it will inevitably affect the normal operation of teaching work. The reason why school building projects could not be completed on time in the past few years is mainly because the phenomenon of approving plans, designing and constructing in the same year has not changed. In order to improve this work, the best way is to change the plan preparation method. For example, instead of determining the annual basic construction plan after first determining the annual enrollment plan, the long-term basic construction plan is prepared according to the long-term career development plan, and the annual basic construction plan is prepared according to the long-term basic construction plan with reference to the estimated enrollment number and balanced design and construction forces in each year; or each year, in addition to approving the basic construction area and investment according to the enrollment task of the current year, an additional amount of construction area and investment will be approved, so that the high-rise building projects that must be designed separately for the next year can be designed and constructed one year in advance, and strive to reverse the passive situation in four or five years; or first advance the design year of the basic construction projects of universities and colleges by one year, and after the basic construction plan is issued in the current year, the design work of all or most of the projects has been completed, and there can be more time for construction, etc. Of course, there are still many difficulties in requiring the comprehensive implementation of these methods, which requires the joint efforts of all parties. However, while actively striving to improve the planning work, we must also pay attention to improving material supply and daily management work.

    谈谈高等学校的校舍问题
    杜尔圻
    七年来，新建校舍数量为解放前五十余年总和的202％——所谓校舍紧张主要是宿舍比较缺乏——采用穿插排课方法提高教学用房的利用率——应在既定的资金范围内多盖些适用的房子
    旧中国留下的高等学校校舍很少，1949年全国高等学校校舍建筑面积只有三百七十余万平方公尺，近七年来已有近八十所学校陆续完成了新建和迁建任务；原有各高等学校也全都进行了规模不等的扩建工程或购置校舍，到1956年年底，全国高等学校校舍数已达一千一百二十余万平方公尺。这就是说，仅仅解放后的七年里，高等学校新建校舍的数量即为解放前五十余年间修建总和的202％。解放后的平均每年建设速度要比解放前的高出十四点五倍。这充分体现了党和政府对高等教育事业的关怀。
    但是，随着形势的发展也出现了许多新的问题。校舍增加速度虽快，在校学生数却增加得更快，因而这就容易造成事业发展与物质保证工作的脱节现象。1955年以前，事业发展比较循序渐进，有些新建工程尚能及时完成，原有生活用房尚有一定潜力可以发挥，新建、迁建学校和重点学校也能得到适当照顾，因而那时校舍数量问题还不突出，基本上能够保证事业发展的需要。但到1956年，一方面由于招生任务增加很快，又临时超额录取了二千多名学生，部分院系调整计划临时改变以及新增加了一批教学力量等；另一方面由于基本建设材料普遍缺乏，某些地区施工力量不足，有些设计资料和设计图纸也不能及时供应，以致新学年开学时竣工使用的校舍很少；再一方面由于有些学校和管理单位在年初制定基本建设计划时，过多地提高了教学用房数量的比例，造成生活用房减少，于是产生了人为的紧张局面；又加上当年一批毕业生未能及时分配出去，所以开学后许多学校，尤其是招生任务比较集中的几个大城市，如北京、上海、南京、武汉、成都等市的一些学校，某些校舍曾一度十分紧张，也确实在不同程度上影响了教学工作的正常进行。
    然而，进一步研究所谓校舍赶不上事业发展的需要，主要是指学生宿舍比较缺乏，其次是指一般教职员工的宿舍比较缺乏。目前有些学校学生宿舍的居住情况是，每人只占居住面积二到二点五平方公尺，最低的仅达一点七平方公尺；根据一百三十八所高等学校居住情况统计，平均解决住宅的户数约占教职员工总数的36％左右，所以这些方面的困难也确实存在。由于过去社会条件的关系，几乎全部学生和大部分教职员工的住房问题都要求国家解决。因为当前城市的居住和交通条件也很紧张，这就难于强调实行走读和自行解决居住问题的办法，因而有关单位和学校为了共同办好祖国的高等教育事业，尽可能地逐步满足大多数人的要求。这些年来，年年新建宿舍和住宅，这方面的建筑面积数已达全国校舍总面积的40％左右了。这个比例不能算低，主要是因为事业发展需要大，受财力、物力限制发生的暂时困难，这是可以向大家说清楚的，只要本着勤俭办学，同甘共苦的精神，困难是可以克服的。至于约占高等学校校舍半数的教学及其有关用房的情况就不相同了。近几年来已新建了不少教学用房，但许多学校教室、实验室、实习工厂和有关附属用房的利用率很低，一般的每周平均使用数都在三十多学时以下，许多学校行政和教学行政用房占的过大；阅览室和运动场地有时很拥挤，有时又很空闲；数千学生学校的食堂仍用一批吃饭方法，以致利用率极低；还有一些福利附属用房也有忙闲不均现象。显然这些校舍的潜力还没有发挥出来。
    经验告诉我们，提高教学用房及其有关校舍利用率的主要关键在于改变排课方法。1954年下半年以来已有少数学校开始摸索，但有人却说实行穿插排课方法不好；也有人说这是被迫的，最好还是沿用旧的单一排课方法。如果从“房子多总比房子少来得好”和“房子盖得起来就不用穿插排课方法”的观点来看，也许那种说法是正确的，可是我们不能这样来衡量。也有人认为，采用穿插排课方法后，因下午上课要“影响教学效果”。我觉得影响教学效果的主要因素是师资数量、师资水平、教材内容和教学法等。事实往往是，虽在上午上课而没有好的教师和好的教材内容也难把学生教好；有了好的教师和好的教材内容而在下午上课也不一定绝对影响教学效果（当然，夏季午休时间和南方某几个城市午后温度过高的因素需要适当考虑和安排）。就以1956—1957学年度上学期开学时清华大学和北京大学校舍利用情况为例，该二校当时各净增二千多名学生，而当年基本建设任务绝大部分都没有完成，除清华大学修建了三千五百平方公尺、北京大学修建了约二千平方公尺的临时教室以外，基本上都仍然维持上一学期的校舍数量。为了解决人多房少的困难，清华大学和北京大学都采用了分部穿插排课方法，食堂采用了分批轮作制；体育活动安排在上午和下午；阅览室整天都可充分利用。因之，他们的教室、各基础课实验室、阅览室、食堂、运动场地及有关附属用房的利用率显著提高。清华大学教室每周平均利用率一般已达四十五到五十五学时，最多的可达六十二学时；北京大学的教室平均利用率也已达四十六学时。学生大量增加而这些校舍基本上没有增添的事实，说明采用穿插排课方法后经济效果是肯定的。现在清华大学教学管理部门正进一步研究排课方法，并认为在实行分部穿插排课后夏季午休时间是可以适当安排的。当然，不可否认，排课问题是个复杂问题，它涉及全部课程的安排和全体师生员工们的活动；也涉及地区条件和旧有校舍条件等，不应该也不可能要求各校都采用同一的穿插排课方法。主要的问题是在修建校舍保证教学需要的同时，必须积极地尽可能地提高它们的利用率。
    校舍的质量问题，首先应该在经济、适用的原则下，考虑有利于学生和教师的学习、工作和生活，建筑结构和装修则要坚固、耐用和朴素大方。自高等学校扩建和新建以来，不少设计单位、施工部门和学校共同努力，以少数的资金修建出较适用的校舍。但1954年以前，由于造价标准订的偏高，有些学校和设计部门又不恰当地提高了建筑质量标准，于是采用了可以不采用的高级结构、豪华的装饰、宽阔的过分讲究的门厅和走道、华贵的设备、飞檐走兽的大屋顶等现象都出现了。这种脱离当前国家经济水平，不恰当地提高建筑质量或进行浪费的设计，是十分错误的，应该从中吸取教训。1955年里贯彻全面节约以后，全国高等学校和有关设计部门在校舍建筑工程方面为国家节约了三千五百多万元，这个成绩是肯定的。但是不少校舍工程又产生了片面“节约”，忽视起码质量要求的现象。显然，这种片面“节约”，因小失大的现象也是错误的，我们也应该从中吸取教训。但是，近来有些学校在拟制1957年计划时又出现要求过高现象。
    总之，在校舍质量问题上，应从当前国家经济可能条件出发，根据既反对铺张浪费又反对片面“节约”的原则制定校舍质量标准和造价指标。结合当前校舍发展赶不上事业发展需要的情况看，主要还是校舍数量问题。因此，各学校应当考虑在既定的资金范围内多盖些适用的房子。
    高等学校对建筑落成时间的要求，最大特点是希望秋季新学年开学以前全部或大部分建筑工程能够竣工使用。尤其在当前当年的基本建设计划任务只能满足当年招生任务要求的情况下，更有此要求，否则势必影响教学工作的正常进行。过去几年校舍工程不能如数及时完成的原因，主要是当年批准计划、当年设计、当年施工的现象没有改变。为了改善这方面的工作，最好的办法是改变计划编制方法。如，不是在先确定年度招生计划之后再确定年度基本建设计划，而是根据长期事业发展计划编制长期基本建设计划，根据长期基本建设计划参照各年预计招生数和平衡设计、施工力量等因素编制年度基本建设计划；或者每年除按当年招生任务核定基本建设面积和投资外，另外多批给一些建筑面积和投资，以便将次年应进行修建的必须单独进行设计的高层的建筑工程项目，提前一年设计和施工，争取在四、五年内扭转被动局面；或者首先将高等学校基本建设工程的设计年度提前一年，基本建设计划于当年下达后，全部或大部分工程的设计工作均已完毕，可以有较多的时间进行施工等。当然，要求全面实施这些方法，困难还是很多的，这有待各方面共同努力。但，在积极争取改进计划工作的同时，还必须注意改善材料供应和日常管理工作。
