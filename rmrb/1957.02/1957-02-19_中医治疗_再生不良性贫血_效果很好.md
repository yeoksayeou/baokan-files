Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 17th: Chinese medicine practitioner Wu Songkang of Zhejiang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital recently cured a disease that has long been considered difficult to treat in the medical field - "aplastic anemia."

    "Aplastic anemia" is a severe form of anemia caused by the decline of the bone marrow's hematopoietic function, which prevents normal blood production. Patients with this disease have significantly reduced hemoglobin levels, a sharp drop in white blood cells and platelets, making their lives extremely dangerous. To date, modern medicine has not found an effective treatment for this disease.

    The patient cured by Wu Songkang was Wang Jundi, a 23-year-old female worker at Zhejiang Administrative College. She began to experience pale skin and shortness of breath upon exertion in mid-February 1956. By March, she frequently fainted. Later, she developed bleeding gums and purplish spots on her skin. Her menstrual periods were prolonged to twenty days each time; her hemoglobin decreased to six grams, her white blood cell count dropped as low as 500, and her platelet count fell to 14,000. After diagnosis by Zhejiang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital (formerly Hangzhou Hospital) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Medical College, she was confirmed to have "aplastic anemia." From March onwards, in addition to using various expensive drugs for anemia, Western doctors administered blood transfusions totaling 14,000 cc. However, her condition did not improve.

    From September of last year, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Medical College invited Wu Songkang for consultation. Initially, Wu Songkang prescribed the traditional Chinese medicine "Jiupi Tang" (Old Spleen Decoction), but the effect was not significant. In early November, he switched to the traditional Chinese medicine "Baozhen Tang" (Protecting the Truth Decoction) with added donkey-hide gelatin and danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) decoction, followed by a powder made from three traditional Chinese herbs: danshen, danggui (Angelica sinensis), and chishao (Paeonia lactiflora). Her condition gradually improved. The number of blood transfusions decreased and eventually stopped completely. By the time she was discharged from the hospital on December 31, the patient's hemoglobin had increased to 12.5 grams (the same as a normal person). She continued to receive outpatient treatment at the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, and her hemoglobin has now reached 13 grams; her white blood cell count has increased to 6,850; her platelet count has increased to 68,000; all bleeding symptoms have stopped, and her menstrual periods are normal. Bone marrow examination proved that the patient's bone marrow hematopoietic function has been restored and is growing vigorously.

    中医治疗“再生不良性贫血”效果很好
    据新华社杭州17日电　浙江中医院中医师吴颂康，最近治好了一个一向被医学界认为很难治疗的绝症——“再生不良性贫血”。
      “再生不良性贫血”是一种由于人体骨髓造血机能衰退，因而不能正常造血所引起的极度贫血。患这种病的病人，血色素大大降低，白血球和血小板都剧减，生命非常危险。到目前为止，在现代医学上还没有找到这种病的有效疗法。
    吴颂康治好的患者是浙江行政学院的工作人员、二十三岁的女青年王骏弟。她在1956年2月中旬开始发现皮肤苍白，行动时气急，到了三月间，常常要晕倒，以后并发现牙龈出血，皮肤出现紫斑，每次月经时间要延长到二十天；血色素减少到六克，白血球最低时到过五百，血小板降至一万四千。经过浙江中医院（原杭州医院）和浙江医学院附属第一医院的诊断，确定为“再生不良性贫血”。从3月份起，西医师们除了采用各种治疗贫血症的贵重药品外，并多次给以输血，先后达一万四千西西。但是病情却并没有减轻。
    从去年9月起，浙江医学院附属第一医院延请吴颂康去会诊。开始时，吴颂康给她服用中药“旧脾汤”，效果不显著；11月初，他又改用中药“保真汤”加阿胶和丹参的汤剂，接着又加服中药丹参、当归和赤芍等三味中药合制的粉剂。病情就日见好转。输血次数减少，终至完全停止。到12月31日出院时，病人的血色素已增加到十二点五克（和正常人相同），以后她又继续在中医院门诊治疗，目前血色素已达到十三克；白血球增加到六千八百五十；血小板增到六万八千；各种出血现象停止，月经正常。经抽骨髓检查，证明病人骨髓的造血机能已经恢复，并且生长旺盛。
