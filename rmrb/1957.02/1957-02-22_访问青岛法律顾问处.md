    Visiting the Qingdao Legal Advisory Office
    Fan Zhen
    The day I went to visit the Qingdao Legal Advisory Office, it was snowing heavily, and the road was covered with a thick layer of snow, but people kept coming one after another. That day, I met visitors: old women in their fifties and sixties, young workers, middle-aged housewives, as well as two landlords and representatives of capitalists. They revealed various expressions on their faces, pouring out their inner doubts and desires to the lawyers. Among them were disputes between landlords and tenants, marital conflicts, and inheritance issues. Problems occurring in different corners of society were brought to these two small rooms.

    The Qingdao Legal Advisory Office was established on June 27 last year. It hasn't been long, and currently only four people are working as lawyers. They faithfully implement the principle of "basing on facts and taking the law as the criterion," realistically safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of clients. It has initially demonstrated the role of the people's lawyer and gained the trust of the masses. Some people say, "Although the court also has an inquiry office, we feel more at ease coming here and can speak without any reservations." In the past six months, they have received more than 2,800 visitors. Some were answering questions, some were providing legal advice, and some were writing complaints on their behalf. Since October of last year, criminal defense and civil representation services have also begun.

    A woman from Gaomi County, leading a middle-aged man, came to the Legal Advisory Office. They looked very tired, but once they arrived, they began to tell the lawyer about an infuriating incident. This woman's twenty-eight-year-old daughter had been tricked into Qingdao by Sheng Xiangwu, a married man nearly fifty years old, to live with him as his concubine, and had a child. Later, because Sheng Xiangwu didn't care about their mother and daughter's life, the court ruled to sever the cohabitation relationship. She returned to her original home in Gaomi and soon married a demobilized soldier. This time, her daughter came to Qingdao to ask Sheng Xiangwu for child support, but he tricked her again with sweet words! Her mother, leading the demobilized soldier, found Qingdao. Sheng Xiangwu bullied them because they were unfamiliar with the place and resorted to many hooligan tricks. They could not do anything to Sheng Xiangwu and came to ask for a lawyer's help. After carefully listening to their statement, the lawyer told them that it could only be resolved through legal procedures, and immediately wrote a complaint on their behalf and contacted the Sifang District People's Court, which quickly handled the matter.

    In the old society, many people suffered from the troubles of old lawyers inciting lawsuits. But today's people's lawyers are completely different. For those who illegally entangle in lawsuits, they persuade them to settle out of court according to the law. In the case of cloth merchant Sun Shoushan inheriting his son's (deceased) inheritance for his daughter-in-law, the Taidong District People's Court ruled that the 200 yuan share of the inheritance should belong to his daughter-in-law. Sun Shoushan refused to accept the judgment and, as a result, the appeal was rejected. He asked the lawyer to write a complaint on his behalf to appeal again, claiming that his daughter-in-law had once declared to give up the right to inherit the inheritance and that he had evidence. The lawyer asked him to bring the evidence, but he couldn't produce it. After the lawyer's persuasion and education, he expressed his willingness to abide by the judgment and no longer appeal. The lawyers believe that doing so is fulfilling their duty.

    People's lawyers handle affairs according to the law, and the defendant can also be convinced wholeheartedly. Not long ago, the lawyers here represented a civil case entrusted by female landlord Wu Shouen. Wu Shouen had a bad relationship with her tenants on weekdays, and the four tenants would rather deposit the rent on a monthly basis than give it to her. She asked the lawyer to file a lawsuit in court. The lawyer in charge analyzed the case, went to the scene to understand the situation, and measured the house, believing that the rent was too high. He discussed it with Wu Shouen in advance, pointed out that landlords and tenants should respect each other, and obtained her authorization to the lawyer to accept mediation in court. In court, based on the law, the lawyer pointed out objectively that the tenants' reasons for refusing to pay the rent lacked legal basis, and also represented the landlord in reducing the excessive rent. After mediation, they immediately expressed that they would pay the rent on time, and said, "If it weren't for the people's lawyer appearing in court today, we would have 'risked' an appeal and would not have been able to settle the matter so happily."

    In less than three days, the tenants indeed paid the arrears.

    When people's lawyers defend criminal defendants, they must not violate the law, reverse right and wrong, and turn something into nothing. They must also argue for the defendant. How can this contradiction be resolved? The lawyers here told me:

    When they accept a commission or are designated as defenders, they first carefully review the indictment to see if it is appropriate. Then they request relevant files and evidence from the court, and then carefully check, analyze, and research the facts that the defendant requests to defend him, according to the defendant's crime time, place, object and motive, purpose, process, means, consequences, and confession situation, and determine whether the defendant really committed the crime. Then, they find out the favorable facts and factors for the defendant, and, with an objective and calm attitude, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the defendant in court in a realistic and truthful manner, so as to be reasonable and legal. Based on this preliminary experience, they have appeared in court for defense 38 times in more than two months, and the effect is still good. Now, criminal defendants detained in Qingdao courts all know that they have the right to ask a lawyer to defend themselves, and nearly half of them have applied for a lawyer to defend them.

    The defendant, Du Junfeng, was a puppet village chief during the Japanese occupation, participated in the "Returning Home Corps," and later joined the Chiang Kai-shek army. After being liberated by our army, he joined the People's Army and is now working at the Qingdao Dye Factory after being transferred to civilian work. According to mass accusations, when he was a puppet village chief in Laixi County, he asked the masses for grain and conscripted soldiers for the Japanese puppets, and relied on his power to beat and scold the masses; in 1947, he also "led" the organization of the "Returning Home Corps" to carry out liquidation. The Sifang District People's Procuratorate therefore filed a public prosecution, believing that the circumstances were serious and requested the court to sentence him. The lawyer accepted Du Junfeng's request to defend him and carefully checked the materials and testimonies provided by the accusers, as well as the confessions of accomplices. In court, he argued that Du Junfeng did not "lead" the organization of the Returning Home Corps for liquidation, and cited that he had confessed his crimes after being transferred to the Qingdao Dye Factory and had no current activities. Therefore, he requested the court to deal with him leniently in accordance with the spirit of the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the lenient handling and resettlement of urban residual counter-revolutionaries. As a result, the court sentenced Du Junfeng to exemption from criminal punishment.

    The above is only a part of the activities of the lawyers here in the past six months. Liu Yuantian, director of the Legal Advisory Office, told me that although their work is still progressing through exploration, practice has clearly proved that the establishment of a people's lawyer system is an urgent requirement of the people. Recently, new situations have emerged in the work. Some disputes between agencies and enterprises have also begun to seek help from lawyers. There are also cases where both the plaintiff and defendant in the same case come to lawyers for representation and assistance. Obviously, the work of the people's lawyers will increasingly play its role in improving the people's democratic legal system and protecting the legitimate interests of the broad masses of the people.

    访问青岛法律顾问处
    范真
    我去访问青岛市法律顾问处的那天，正在下大雪，马路上覆盖着厚厚的一层雪，但是到这里来的人还是接连不断。这天，我遇见的来访者：有五、六十岁的老太婆，有年轻工人，还有中年家庭主妇，以及两个房主和资方代理人。他们脸上流露着各种神情，向律师倾诉着心里的疑难和愿望。这当中有房主与房客的争执，婚姻纠纷，以及遗产继承等等问题。发生在社会上不同角落的问题都被带到了这两间不大的屋子里来了。
    青岛市法律顾问处是在去年6月27日成立的，时间并不长，目前只有四个人做律师工作，他们忠诚地贯彻了“以事实为根据，以法律为准绳”的原则，实事求是地维护委托人的合法权益。已经初步显示出人民律师的作用，取得了群众的信任。有些人说：“虽然法院也有询问处，但是我们觉得到这里来要更自如些，可以毫无顾忌地说话。”半年来他们已接待了两千八百多人次。有的是解答疑问，有的是提供法律意见，有的是代写诉状。从去年10月份起，又开始了刑事辩护和民事代理业务。
    一个从高密县来的妇女，领着一个中年男人来到法律顾问处。他们精神显得很疲倦，来到后却滔滔不绝地向律师叙述着一件令人气愤的事情。这位妇女的二十八岁的女儿，曾经被近五十岁的已婚男人盛香五骗到青岛来姘居，生有一个小孩。以后因为盛香五不管她们母女的生活，经过法院判处断绝姘居关系，回到高密原籍，不久便与一个复员军人结了婚。这次她女儿来青岛向盛香五要孩子生活费，又被他花言巧语蒙住了！她母亲领着那位复员军人找到了青岛，盛香五欺负他们人地生疏，耍了许多流氓手腕。他们奈何不得盛香五，来请律师帮助。律师细心地听取了他们的陈述后，告诉他们要经过法律手续才能解决，随即代他们写了诉状，并且和四方区人民法院联系，很快就进行了处理。
    在旧社会，很多人都吃过旧律师挑词架讼的苦头。但是今天的人民律师却完全是两回事。他们对于违法缠讼的人，根据法律说服他们息讼。布商孙寿山为儿媳继承其子（已故）遗产一案，经台东区人民法院判决遗产中的二百元股份应归其儿媳所有，孙寿山不服判决，结果上诉驳回。他要求律师代写诉状再次上诉，理由是他的儿媳妇曾经声明放弃遗产继承权，并且说他有证据，律师要他找来证据，却拿不出来。经律师说服教育，他表示愿意服从判决，不再上诉。律师们认为这样做是尽自己的职责。
    人民律师依法办事，被告也能心悦诚服。不久前，这里的律师代理了女房主吴受恩委托的民事案件。吴受恩平日与房客关系不好，四个房客宁肯按月把房租存起来也不交给她。她请求律师代理向法院起诉。承办律师分析了案情，又到现场了解了情况，丈量了房屋，认为房租偏高。事先与吴受恩商谈，指出房主房客之间应该互相尊重，并且取得她授予律师可以在法庭上接受调解的权利。在法庭上，律师依据法令，中肯地指出房客们提出不交租的理由缺乏法律根据，也代理房主减去过高的租金。经过调解，他们即表示要按期交租，并说：“今天如果不是人民律师出庭，我们‘豁’上上诉也不能这样痛快了事。”
    不到三天，房客们果然补交了欠租。
    人民律师在为刑事被告辩护时，既不能违背法律，颠倒是非，把有化无，又要为被告申辩，这个矛盾如何解决呢？这里的律师告诉我：
    他们接受委托或被指定充当辩护人时，首先仔细审阅起诉书，看是否恰当。然后向法院调阅有关卷宗材料和证据，再根据被告要求为他辩护的事实，对他的犯罪时间、地点、对象和动机目的、过程、手段、后果以及供认情况逐项仔细查对，分析研究，确定被告是否真正犯罪。然后从中找出对被告的有利的事实和因素，抱着客观冷静的态度，在法庭上实事求是地维护被告的合法权益，做到有理、合法。他们根据这样初步摸索出的经验，两个多月中，共出庭辩护了三十八次，效果还好。现在，青岛法院在押的刑事被告，都知道有请律师为自己辩护的权利，并且有近半数的人申请过律师为自己辩护。
    被告杜俊峰是一个日伪保长，曾参加“还乡团”，以后参加蒋军，被我军解放后又参加人民军队，现在转业在青岛染料厂做工。根据群众检举，他在原籍莱西县充当日伪保长时曾为日伪向群众要粮、拔丁，并仗势打骂群众；1947年又曾“为首”组织“还乡团”进行倒算。四方区人民检察院因此提起公诉，认为情节严重，请法院判处。律师接受杜俊峰的请求为他辩护，并详细查对了检举人提供的材料和证词，以及同案犯的供词，在法庭上论证了杜俊峰并没有“为首”组织还乡倒算，并举出他在转业到青岛染料厂后对自己的罪恶已作过交代，并且没有现行活动。因此请求法庭按照全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于宽大处理和安置城市残余反革命分子的决定精神，从轻处理。结果法庭判处杜俊峰免予刑事处分。
    以上这些仅是这里律师们半年多来活动中的一部分。法律顾问处主任刘元田告诉我，虽然他们的工作还在摸索中前进，但是实践已经清楚地证明建立人民律师制度是人民群众的迫切要求。最近工作还出现了新的情况，有些机关企业之间发生争执，也开始来找律师给予帮助了。还有同一案件的原、被告双方都来找律师代理、帮助的。很明显，人民律师的工作，在健全人民民主法制和保护广大人民的合法利益中将日益发挥它的作用。
