Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th (TASS) - A reporter from "Labor Daily" in Prague asked some representatives of the international trade union movement attending the 13th session of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions to answer the following questions:

These questions are: an evaluation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and its possible consequences, and what efforts the working class of all countries should make to prevent atomic war and strive for a cessation of the arms race.

Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his reply that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a disguised form of colonialism by the United States, which will exacerbate international tensions. However, the people of all countries have long launched a struggle against colonialism and have achieved many major victories. Therefore, this "doctrine" has been condemned by the people of the East and the West from the very beginning.

Liu Changsheng said that the working class of People's China believes that the basic guarantee for preventing atomic war is to accelerate the socialist construction of our country, consolidate the unity of the working class of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, consolidate the unity of the international working class, and develop friendly and business relations with all peace-loving countries.

Bittosi, Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, said that the United States put forward this new "doctrine" in an attempt to disguise its intention to seize the markets and natural wealth of the Middle East and Near East, hoping to continue the imperialist exploitation policies previously implemented by France and Britain and to ensure the possibility of sending American troops to the Arab Orient.

Akira Yoshida, Chairman of the All-Japan Metalworkers' Union, refuted Eisenhower's so-called "vacuum" argument in his reply. Toledano, Chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation, pointed out that this "doctrine's" provision of "assistance" to the Middle East and Near East is a hypocritical propaganda. He said that in reality, its purpose is to establish exclusive control of American monopoly capital in the region.

Mendis, a leading member of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation, said that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" means enslavement and impoverishment of the people of the East and the West. The sacred responsibility of the people of the East and the West is to rise up against the new plans of the colonialists.

In response to the question of what efforts the working class of all countries should make to prevent atomic war and stop the arms race, the Japanese representative said that the Japanese people stand at the forefront of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. Under the pressure of the people, the Japanese Diet unanimously passed a resolution on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. He said that the struggle for peace and independence is an integral part of the international labor movement. It is necessary to consolidate the international solidarity of the working people.

Toledano and Bittosi pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the masses' struggle against the expansion of armaments and against war by using concrete examples to explain to the people the scourge of a new war. In his reply, the Ceylon representative stated that the Ceylon working class will consolidate its ranks and the unity of the entire nation, and lead the people to fight against American imperialism and new wars.

    出席世界工联执委会的各国代表
    反对美国殖民主义者的新计划
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：“劳动报”驻布拉格记者要求参加世界工会联合会执行委员会第十三次会议的一些国际工会运动代表回答下列的问题：
    这些问题是：对“艾森豪威尔主义”的评价和它可能带来的后果以及各国工人阶级为了防止原子战争和争取停止扩充军备，应当做的努力。
    中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜在答复中说，“艾森豪威尔主义”是美国变相的殖民主义，它将加剧国际紧张局势。但是，各国人民早就掀起了反殖民主义的斗争，而且取得了许多重大胜利。因此，这个“主义”从一开始就受到东西方人民的谴责。
    刘长胜说，人民中国的工人阶级认为，防止原子战争的基本保障是加紧我们国家的社会主义建设，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义国家的工人阶级的团结、巩固国际工人阶级的团结以及同一切爱好和平的国家发展友好和事务关系。
    意大利总工会书记比托西说，美国提出这个新的“主义”，是企图掩饰它的攫夺中近东市场和天然财富的意图，希望继续执行过去法国和英国所执行的帝国主义剥削政策和保证有可能把美国军队派遣到阿拉伯东方。
    全日本金属工会委员长吉田明在回答中驳斥了艾森豪威尔的所谓“真空”的论调。拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席托列达诺指出，这个“主义”对中近东提供“援助”是一种虚伪宣传。他说，实际上它的目的是要在这个地区建立美国垄断资本的独家控制。
    锡兰工会联合会领导委员曼迪斯说，“艾森豪威尔主义”意味着对东西方人民进行奴役和使他们贫困。东西方人民的神圣责任是：起来反对殖民主义者的新计划。
    在回答各国工人阶级为了防止原子战争和停止扩军而应当做些什么努力的问题时，日本代表说，日本人民站在争取禁止原子弹和氢弹的运动的最前列。在人民的压力下，日本国会一致通过了关于禁止核子武器的决议。他说，争取和平和独立的斗争是国际工人运动的组成部分。必须要巩固劳动人民的国际团结。
    托列达诺和比托西指出，必须用具体的事例向人民说明新战争的祸害，来加强群众的反对扩张军备和反对战争的斗争。锡兰代表在回答中表示，锡兰工人阶级将巩固自己的队伍和全民族的团结，领导人民同美国帝国主义和新战争进行斗争。
