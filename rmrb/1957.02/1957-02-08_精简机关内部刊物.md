Streamline Internal Publications of Government Agencies	Chen Zhong
    Some internal publications issued by state agencies do indeed play a role in "exchanging experiences and guiding work." However, too many and too poor internal publications can lead to waste and foster the development of bureaucracy. According to incomplete statistics from 58 units at the provincial and municipal levels in Zhejiang, there are 90 types of regular and irregular internal publications, with countless names. The banking system has "Banking Communications," and the health department has "Health Communications." Their affiliated institutions also have internal publications. For example, the Provincial Department of Culture has "Zhejiang Cultural Work Communications," and various sections, divisions, and business units also publish "Reference Materials for Mass Cultural Work," "Film Work," "Book Distribution," "Workers' Singing," "Mass Creation," "Drama Work," and various communications and materials on music, dance, and fine arts, as well as performance summaries. Some departments also issue official circulars and various learning reference materials. Because there are too many publications, the source of articles is exhausted, so they publish empty and meaningless summaries, reports from the heads of their departments, compilations and reprints of articles from other newspapers and periodicals, and even openly performed songs and photos that have been repeatedly published in newspapers and periodicals are used to fill the ranks; what could be typeset in five-point font is changed to four-point font. The so-called business publications are actually mostly the same, boring, and unable to guide work.

    These publications are run in excessive quantities and with poor quality, which inevitably leads to waste of manpower, financial resources, and materials. First of all, each unit has full-time or part-time personnel to write articles for these publications, which expands the staffing. Secondly, it causes a great waste of funds. In the Hangzhou area alone, it is estimated that more than 200,000 yuan is spent on paper alone each year to publish these publications, and the expenses for printing, postage, staff salaries, and manuscript fees are even greater. In particular, many publications, regardless of the difficulty of paper supply, in order to expand the publicity effect, in addition to blindly distributing them, also give away a large number of them for free, which cannot but increase the number of copies issued. The Provincial Department of Education's "Literacy Communications" farmers' edition has 55,000 copies printed each issue; the Forestry Department's "Forestry Communications" used to print 20,000 copies each issue.

    The proliferation of internal publications not only causes waste but also fosters the bureaucracy of leaders at all levels. They "guide" work with empty publications, without going deep into reality to solve the more pressing problems in their work.

    Waste and bureaucracy are contrary to the principles of the Party and state organs to connect with the masses and increase production and practice economy. I suggest that all localities re-examine the existing internal publications, some of which can be retained, and some of which should be suspended or merged. For those that continue to be published, a subscription and cost recovery approach should be adopted, and free distribution should be stopped, in order to promote the publishing organs to improve the quality of the publications and meet the real work needs of the business departments. Currently, the Zhejiang provincial organs have already started doing this with individual internal publications.

    精简机关内部刊物	陈中
    国家机关出版的内部刊物，有的确起了“交流经验，指导工作”的作用。但是，又多又滥的内部刊物，就会造成浪费，助长官僚主义的发展。据浙江省级和杭州市级五十八个单位不完全统计，各种定期和不定期的内部刊物有九十种；名目繁多，不可胜数：银行系统有“银行通讯”，卫生部门有“卫生通讯”；它们所属机构，还有内部刊物。如省文化局有“浙江文化工作通讯”，各科、处和业务单位又出版了“群众文化工作参考资料”、“电影工作”、“图书发行”、“工人演唱”、“群众创作”、“戏剧工作”及音乐、舞蹈、美术等各种通讯和资料、会演简报等。有些部门还出了公文通报和各种各样的学习参考资料。因刊物太多，稿源枯竭，就登些空泛的意义不大的总结、本部门首长的报告，汇编和转载其他报刊的文章，甚至连公开演唱的歌曲、报刊上一再登过的照片，也滥竽充数地用上了；可以用五号字排的，改排为四号字。名为业务性的刊物，实际内容大都是千篇一律，枯燥无味，起不了指导工作的作用。
    这些刊物办得又多又滥，必然会造成人力、财力、物力的浪费。首先，各单位都有专职或兼职人员为这些刊物编写稿件，这就扩大了人员编制。其次，造成经费上的很大浪费，就杭州地区来说，为了出版这些刊物，仅纸张一项，估计一年要花二十万元以上，印刷费、邮寄费、工作人员的开支、稿费等支出就更多了。尤其是许多刊物，不顾纸张供应困难的情况，为了扩大宣传效果，除了盲目发行以外，还大量赠送，这就不能不增加发行份数。省教育厅“扫盲通讯”的农民版每期要印五万五千份；林业厅的“林业通讯”，过去每期要印二万册。
    内部刊物泛滥，不仅造成浪费，也助长了各级领导干部的官僚主义。他们在凭空洞的刊物“指导”工作，不去深入实际，解决工作中更为迫切的问题。
    浪费、官僚主义，是同党和国家机关必须联系群众、增产节约的原则相违背的。我建议：各地重新审查一遍现有的内部刊物，有的可保留，有的应停办或合并。而对于继续出版的，也应该采取定阅和收回成本的办法，停止免费赠送，以促使出版机关提高刊物的质量，满足业务部门的真正工作需要。目前，浙江省级机关对个别的内部刊物，已开始这样做了。
