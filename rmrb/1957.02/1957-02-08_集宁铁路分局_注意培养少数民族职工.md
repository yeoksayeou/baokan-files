Jining Railway Sub-bureau

Pays Attention to Training Ethnic Minority Employees

    (Our dispatch) Since the joint operation of the Ji-Er Line began in January 1956, the Party organization of the Jining Railway Sub-bureau has been paying attention to training ethnic minority cadres and employees, and has achieved certain results in the past year.

    The employees of the Jining Railway Sub-bureau were originally mostly Han Chinese, with ethnic minority employees accounting for only 1.1% of all employees. By the end of last year, the number of ethnic minority employees and cadres had increased more than fourfold, and more than 98% of them had been converted into formal workers. At the same time, five leading cadres at the station and section level have been assigned.

    In order to help ethnic minorities develop into modern nationalities, the Party committee believes that it is necessary to actively help ethnic minorities train their own scientific and technical cadres and business management cadres. Strive to have more than half of the main leading cadres of stations and sections on the entire line be ethnic minority cadres by the end of 1962; secondly, actively recruit ethnic minorities to participate in railway work. It is planned that by the end of the second five-year plan, the ratio of ethnic minority employees to Han employees can reach ten to one. The Party committee requires Party organizations throughout the line to strengthen leadership in the work of training ethnic minority employees and develop organizations among ethnic minorities in a planned manner.

    集宁铁路分局
    注意培养少数民族职工
    本报讯　从1956年1月集二线开始联运以来，集宁铁路分局党组织就注意培养少数民族干部和职工，一年来已经取得了一定成绩。
    集宁铁路分局的职工，原来大多是汉族职工，少数民族职工只占全体职工的1.1％。到去年年底，少数民族职工干部增加了四倍多，其中已有98％以上转为正式工人。同时，已经配备了站段级以上领导干部五名。
    为了帮助少数民族发展成为现代民族，党委认为必须积极帮助少数民族培养自己的科学技术干部和企业管理干部。争取在1962年末，全线站段的主要领导干部，半数以上由少数民族干部担任；其次要积极吸收少数民族参加铁路工作。计划到第二个五年计划末少数民族职工与汉族职工的比例，可成十比一，党委要求全线党组织，加强对培养民族职工工作的领导，有计划地在少数民族中发展组织。
