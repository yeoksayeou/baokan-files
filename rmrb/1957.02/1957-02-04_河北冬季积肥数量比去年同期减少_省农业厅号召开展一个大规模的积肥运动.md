    (This article reports that) this year, Hebei Province requires the accumulation of approximately 400 billion jin of manure before the spring sowing; spring crops should be fertilized with an average of more than 3,000 jin per mu, and wheat fields should be top-dressed with an average of about 2,000 jin per mu. As of around January 13th, the province had accumulated 167.2 billion jin of manure, averaging about 1,800 jin per mu of spring fallow land. Among them, the Chengde Special District has accumulated enough fertilizer to apply more than 3,600 jin per mu of spring fallow land. Although Hebei Province's manure accumulation work has made great progress, it is still very uneven and not very widespread. According to statistics from five counties including Fengrun, Liangxiang, Anguo, Gaocheng, and Cheng'an: only 33% of the townships have formed a manure accumulation movement; more than 40% of the townships have just begun to lead manure accumulation; 22% of the townships are left to their own devices, and manure accumulation activities are sluggish. The amount of manure accumulated in the province is also 35.9 billion jin less than in the same period last year. Therefore, the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture called in the Hebei Daily to launch a vigorous manure accumulation campaign to ensure the completion of the manure accumulation plan before spring plowing and sowing.
    Due to some formalistic shortcomings that occurred during last year's manure accumulation upsurge, some people are currently hesitant and dare not engage in movements again. The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture believes that we should see that the formalism in the manure accumulation movement is a shortcoming of the work, not an inevitable product of the mass movement. At the same time, agricultural production inherently requires the masses to do it. Without engaging in mass movements and without mobilizing the masses, the work will certainly not be done well. Of course, we must also learn from last year's lessons in the manure accumulation movement, avoid formalism, emphasize practical results, attach equal importance to quality and quantity, and pay attention to safety.
    The broad masses of peasants are very concerned about the current shortage of manure. So, why are they not actively accumulating manure? The problem lies in the fact that the various policies of rewarding manure accumulation have not been implemented more deeply. According to key understandings, at least more than half of the agricultural cooperatives have not yet promptly cleared the old accounts of manure contributed by members to the cooperative in the past. Members do not receive remuneration for the manure they contribute to the cooperative, which hurts their enthusiasm. Therefore, it is necessary to clear the old manure accumulation accounts of the past cooperative by cooperative and household by household, and help the agricultural cooperative formulate new and reasonable manure accumulation remuneration methods in the spirit of more work, more gain.
    As long as a manure accumulation upsurge is launched, fertilizer sources can be actively tapped from many aspects. According to rough estimates, Hebei Province has more than 4 million head of large livestock, which can excrete more than 68 billion jin of feces and urine throughout the year; more than 5 million pigs, which can excrete more than 10 billion jin of feces and urine throughout the year; more than 4.31 million sheep, which can excrete more than 3.4 billion jin of feces and urine throughout the year; the province's population is more than 40 million, which can accumulate more than 20 billion jin of human feces and urine throughout the year. The above four items total 105 billion jin of feces and urine. If mixed with bedding soil, weeds, leaves, etc. at a ratio of one to five, more than 520 billion jin of fertilizer can be accumulated. Calculated according to the ingredients and value contained in these fertilizers, it is equivalent to 4.25 billion jin of ammonium sulfate and 2.58 billion jin of superphosphate, which is more than 16 times the amount of chemical fertilizer supplied in the province in 1956. In addition, there are also kang soil, fallen house soil, kitchen stove soil, poultry manure, plant ash, etc. in various places. Various places should help agricultural cooperatives make full use of these fertilizers.

### 河北冬季积肥数量比去年同期减少  省农业厅号召开展一个大规模的积肥运动

    河北冬季积肥数量比去年同期减少
    省农业厅号召开展一个大规模的积肥运动
    本报讯　1957年河北省要求在春季播种以前积肥四千亿斤左右；春播作物每亩平均施肥三千斤以上，麦田追肥平均每亩两千斤左右。截至1月13日前后，全省已积肥一千六百七十二亿斤，全省春白地平均每亩可施一千八百斤左右。其中承德专区每亩春白地可施的肥料已达到三千六百多斤。河北省的积肥工作虽然已有很大进展，但还很不平衡和很不普遍。据丰润、良乡、安国、藁城、成安等五个县统计：仅有33％的乡形成了积肥运动；有40％多的乡才开始领导积肥；有22％的乡领导自流，积肥活动消沉。现在全省积肥数量也比去年同期少三百五十九亿斤。因此，河北省农业厅在河北日报上号召发动一个轰轰烈烈的积肥运动，以保证在春耕播种前完成积肥计划。
    由于去年积肥高潮中发生了一些形式主义的缺点，目前还有些人束手束脚，不敢再搞运动了。河北省农业厅认为：我们应当看到，积肥运动中的形式主义是工作的缺点，不是群众运动的必然产物。同时，农业生产本来需要群众来做，不搞群众运动，群众没发动起来，就一定作不好工作。当然，在积肥运动中也必须接受去年的教训，避免形式主义，讲求实效，质量并重，注意安全。
    广大农民群众对于当前积肥少很耽心。那末，为什么他们不积极积肥呢？问题在于还没有更深入地贯彻执行奖励积肥的各项政策。据重点了解，至少还有半数以上的农业社到现在还没有及时地清理过去社员入社肥料的旧账，社员入社的肥料得不到报酬，伤害了他们的积极性。因此，必须逐社逐户地清理过去积肥旧账，帮助农业社本着多劳多得的精神，制定新的合理的积肥计酬办法。
    只要掀起了积肥高潮，就可以从多方面积极地挖掘肥源了。据粗略估算，河北省有大牲畜四百多万头，全年可排泄粪尿六百八十多亿斤，有生猪五百余万口，全年可排泄粪尿一百多亿斤，羊四百三十一万多只，全年可排泄粪尿三十四亿多斤，全省人口四千多万，全年可积人粪尿二百多亿斤，以上四项共计粪尿一千零五十亿斤。如果按一比五掺垫圈土、杂草、树叶等，可以积肥五千二百多亿斤。按这些肥料所含成分和价值计算，相当于硫酸铵四十二亿五千万斤，和过磷酸钙二十五亿八千万斤，相当1956年全省供应化肥数量的十六倍多。此外，各地还有炕土、落房土、锅台土、家禽粪、草木灰等等。各地应该帮助农业社充分利用这些肥料。
