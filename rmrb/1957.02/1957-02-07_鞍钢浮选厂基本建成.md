    Anshan Iron and Steel's Flotation Plant Basically Completed

    (Our dispatch) The new flotation plant project of Anshan Iron and Steel has been basically completed.

    The newly built flotation plant is an automated and mechanized factory. The entire plant has five main production workshops, and over 90% of the factory buildings and equipment are manufactured by our own country.

    After this plant is put into production, it can supply a large amount of artificial rich ore to the iron-smelting furnaces every day, and it can also train more technical personnel for the Dagushan Flotation Plant and the Donganshan Flotation Plant, which are starting construction and will soon be constructed.

    鞍钢浮选厂基本建成
    本报讯　鞍钢新建的浮选厂工程，已经基本完工。
    新建的浮选厂是一座自动化机械化的工厂，全厂共有五个主要生产车间，厂房设备有90％以上全是我国自己制造的。
    这个厂投入生产以后，每天可以供给炼铁炉大量的人造富矿，还可为正开工兴建和即将兴建的大孤山浮选厂、东鞍山浮选厂培养出更多的技术人材。
