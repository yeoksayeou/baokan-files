Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 14th. This year, Shanghai's iron and steel industry will increase production by more than 50,000 tons of steel and more than 40,000 tons of steel products compared to last year, while continuously overcoming difficulties in the supply of raw materials. This is calculated by the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company based on the latest annual plan figures for this year.

　　In January, Shanghai's iron and steel industry increased production by more than 11,000 tons of steel and more than 15,000 tons of steel products compared to the same period last year, achieving the first victory of the year. Those familiar with the situation said that this achievement was made with the constant and intense calculation, balancing, and allocation of raw materials by the raw material supply staff of the Shanghai iron and steel industry, as well as the efforts and support of iron smelting plants and transportation departments in various regions. Raw material supply staff also stated: This year, we will never let any steelmaking furnace in Shanghai's iron and steel industry shut down for even a minute due to lack of materials.

　　Converter steelmaking workers at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant have recently begun using lower-quality high-phosphorus pig iron for steelmaking. This is another important measure to overcome the shortage of raw materials this year. Because they paid attention to operation in production, the use of this high-phosphorus pig iron for steelmaking did not cause fluctuations in steel quality and output.

　　Various steel plants will also further improve quality and reduce losses during the production process to increase the production of steel and steel products.

    努力节约原材料增产原材料
    上海今年将增产九万多吨钢和钢材
    今年第一个胜利：一月份比去年同期多产两万六千多吨
    新华社上海14日电　上海钢铁工业今年将在不断战胜原材料供应困难的情况下，比去年多生产五万多吨钢和四万多吨钢材。这是上海钢铁公司根据最新的今年年度计划数字计算出来的。
    1月份上海钢铁工业比去年同期增产了一万一千多吨钢和一万五千多吨钢材，取得了今年的第一个胜利。熟悉情况的人说，这个成就是在上海钢铁工业部门原材料供应工作人员们经常紧张的计算、平衡和调拨原材料，以及各地炼铁厂、运输部门的努力支援下取得的。原材料供应工作人员还表示：今年，决不让上海钢铁工业所有的炼钢炉因断料而停炉一分钟。
    上海第三钢厂和上海第六钢厂的转炉炼钢工人，最近已经开始采用质量较差的高磷生铁炼钢。这是克服今年原材料不足困难的又一重要措施。由于他们在生产中注意操作，采用这种高磷生铁炼钢没有造成钢的质量和产量的波动。
    各个钢铁厂还将进一步提高质量，减少生产过程中的损失，来增产钢和钢材。
