Before My Several Documentary Films Are Released 	Yoris Ivens

Sometimes I feel that some documentaries only begin their lives after they are completed. And sometimes, long after these documentaries are made, when they are screened for new audiences, I meet them again on their life's journey like meeting old friends.

This is how I feel now that my three films are about to be released in Beijing. These three films were made many years ago: "Rain" was filmed in 1928, "The Spanish Earth" in 1937, and "Indonesia Calling" in 1946. As documentaries, they are quite old, and each one was made under different circumstances.

"Rain" was filmed in my homeland, the Netherlands, during the silent film era, and later a young Dutch musician composed music for it. "Rain" began its life in film clubs and new cinemas in Paris, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, and other places. In the early days of our young film art history, it surprised the audience by showing that the beauty of rain, its unpleasantness, and the nostalgia it evokes could be expressed through close-up shots in film; that documentary films could have a lyrical component.

Then, in 1930, when I first visited filmmakers in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev, I brought a copy of "Rain" with me. After the screening, it sparked many heated discussions about the principles and tasks of documentary filmmaking.

After this, "Rain" grew up. In the following years, it was sometimes shown as part of regular commercial programs, and screened in large cinemas alongside excellent feature films. Later, it was also welcomed by students at film schools in various countries. Currently, "Rain" lives quietly in film archives in many countries. I feel very honored and happy that it can now appear on the screen of the Capital Cinema in Beijing.

"Rain" is a film I love very much, and this is often how an artist feels about their early works. And I am very happy that it still feels like a fresh rain.

The life history of "The Spanish Earth" is completely different and more moving. It was filmed during the heroic struggle of the Spanish people to defend freedom and democracy and resist the fascists. Here, one can see the first fire set by the fascists in Europe, which resulted in the tragedy of World War II.

"The Spanish Earth" began its life on the screens of about four hundred cinemas and social gatherings in the United States. In addition to introducing the truth about the Spanish people's struggle to millions of people, it also helped raise funds to purchase seventeen ambulances to send to the Spanish democratic army and the international brigades fighting alongside them against fascism.

When "The Spanish Earth" was screened at the League of Nations in Geneva, it convincingly proved the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Spanish Republic with vivid facts, as he appealed for the just cause of the Spanish people.

Subsequently, "The Spanish Earth" went to many countries, allowing countless people to hear the call to be vigilant against fascism and the story of the Spanish people's struggle. The Spanish people live on the land of Spain, which should belong to them because they labor on this land, and now they are fighting for the freedom and independence of their country and to possess this land.

Of course, the fascist censorship system did not allow this film conveying justice to be screened in Hitler's Germany and Japan.

In my homeland, the Netherlands, the film was successful when it was screened in 1937, and only one copy was preserved in the Netherlands. In 1940, when Hitler's army invaded the Netherlands, they brought a list of films to be confiscated immediately, and "The Spanish Earth" was at the top of this list.

Many years passed, and after the end of World War II, the Soviet Union transferred the collection of the former Goebbels National Film Archive, seized by the Soviet army when they liberated Berlin, to the German Democratic Republic. It was in the storage room of this archive that we found the complete and undamaged old copy of "The Spanish Earth" that the fascist army had stolen in Amsterdam.

Now, this film is about to be released in Beijing. Although it has lost the current political value it had when it was made as a fighting documentary, like many documentaries, it now has a second value as a historical document, even as a living historical document representing the voice of the people.

It gives the Chinese audience a real sense of the story of the heroic Spanish people. After watching this film, Chinese audiences can more clearly understand that the current heroic strikes of Barcelona workers, the student movement of the Spanish revolution, and all actions of the Spanish Communist Party against Franco's reign of terror are a continuation of this struggle.

The life of "Indonesia Calling" is even more dramatic than that of "The Spanish Earth." The making of this film itself was a difficult adventure.

This documentary originated from some newsreel footage reporting on a strike in the port of Sydney, Australia, in 1945. This strike was not expected to develop so seriously beforehand, and in retrospect, we can say that history itself wrote the story for this film with the theme of international solidarity of the working class.

Of course, the Australian authorities tried every possible means to prevent the making of this anti-colonial film. I still clearly remember the heroic filming by female photographer Marijn Mitchell, and also the effective assistance given by the striking Australian dockworkers to protect our filming work from the sabotage of the Sydney port police.

Under mass pressure, the newborn "Indonesia Calling" passed the Australian censorship authorities. It was even more difficult to transport this film to other countries for screening. The struggle to obtain an export license for this short and powerful film caused a political incident in the Australian Parliament in Canberra. Finally, the export license was obtained, and copies of the film reached Europe and the Americas. In addition to the English version, copies of the Malay version were also reproduced on small film.

The difficulty at this time was how to transport these copies to Indonesia, because the Dutch colonial fleet was blockading the Indonesian archipelago at that time. Several Malay versions of the film were transported by plane from Australia to Singapore, and on a pitch-black night, a small boat broke through the blockade and reached the coast of Java via Sumatra.

We didn't know until much later that a copy had safely arrived in Indonesia. This copy was widely screened outdoors at night, sometimes simultaneously in various cities and villages of Java to tens of thousands of people, reporting the truth about the massive solidarity strikes of workers, dockworkers, and sailors from Indonesia, Australia, China, India, and Malaya. This strike prevented ships loaded with weapons and ammunition from sailing from Australian ports to Indonesia to destroy the young republic.

The Dutch propaganda machine told the eighty million people of Indonesia that no one in the world cared about their struggle for independence. This film powerfully refuted the lies of the Dutch propaganda machine in Indonesia.

"You are not isolated," the film convincingly told them with concrete facts, "Look at what is happening in Australia, it is not in vain for Indonesia to ask its friends for help."

In this way, this short, twenty-minute film, smuggled from Australia to Java, unexpectedly became a powerful weapon of struggle for this young republic, helping to mobilize new fighters to fight for the independence of Indonesia.

"Indonesia Calling" originated from the daily struggle of Indonesian and Australian sailors, and after it was made, it returned to the reality of the struggle, even playing a positive role in this struggle—but in its own way.

The spiritual and emotional impact of documentary films cannot be underestimated, and the works of many documentary filmmakers around the world in recent years have proved this.

Our direct and intimate contact with the daily lives of the people gives us documentary filmmakers strength and makes us aware of our responsibility: we must use this strength to serve the highest ideals and aspirations of the people.

Together with the other branch of our young film art—feature films—we must use our respective special creative methods to seek our own paths and express vivid and inspiring film language.

I fully believe that young Chinese documentary filmmakers will create such films, because, having mastered their art and technology, they have—and see and feel around them—the vitality of modern China; they will listen to the beating of their motherland's heart. I believe that their films will realistically and vividly reflect their people's enthusiasm for the socialist cause and their firm will to demand peace.

Such films—expressions of national art—can not only serve the Chinese people, but also inspire a wide audience in other countries.

Our film language is also an international language, which must promote the understanding of the people of all countries and consolidate their true friendship. The hands of friends clasped tightly together are a powerful force, and we must use this force to defend world peace.

### 写在我的几部纪录片上映之前

    写在我的几部纪录片上映之前	约里斯·伊文思
    有时候我觉得有些纪录片是在创作完成了之后才开始它们的生命的。而且有的时候，在这些纪录片制成很久以后，当它们在新的观众面前放映时，我又像旧友重逢一样在它们的生命道路上遇见了它们。
    现在我的三部影片即将在北京上映，我的感觉就是这样。这三部影片是在多年以前摄制的：“雨”摄于1928年，“西班牙的土地”摄于1937年，“印度尼西亚的召唤”摄于1946年。作为纪录片，它们的年岁已经不小了，而且每一部都是在不同的情况下摄制的。
    “雨”是在默片时代在我的祖国荷兰拍摄的，后来由一位年轻的荷兰音乐家为它配了音乐。“雨”这部影片是在巴黎、伦敦、阿姆斯特丹、柏林等地的电影俱乐部和新型电影院开始它的生命的。在我们年轻的电影艺术的历史初期，它出乎观众意料，使他们感到诧异的是：雨的美丽，它的可厌和它所引起的乡愁竟然能够用电影的特写镜头表现出来；纪录片竟然能够有一种抒情的成分。
    接着在1930年，我第一次访问莫斯科、列宁格勒和基辅的电影工作者的时候，随身带去了一部“雨”的拷贝。放映之后，引起了许多次关于纪录片的原则和任务的热烈讨论。
    在这以后，“雨”成长起来了。在以后几年中，有时候它也作为普通的营业性的节目上映，而且在大电影院中和出色的故事片一同放映。后来，它还受到各国电影学校的学生们的欢迎。目前，“雨”在许多国家的电影资料馆中过着静悄悄的生活。现在它能够在北京首都电影院的银幕上出现，使我感到非常荣幸和高兴。
    “雨”是我心爱的一部电影，一个艺术家对于他的初期作品的感觉往往是这样的。而且我感到很高兴的是，它仍旧像一阵初下的新雨。
    完全不同的是“西班牙的土地”的比较动人心弦的生命史。它是在西班牙人民保卫自由和民主、抵抗法西斯分子的英勇斗争中摄制的。在这里可以看出法西斯分子在欧洲放的第一把火，其结果是引起了第二次世界大战的惨祸。
    “西班牙的土地”的生命是在美国大约四百家电影院和社会团体会场的银幕上放映时开始的。除了把西班牙人民的斗争的真相介绍给千千万万的人们以外，它还帮助募集了款项，因而能够购买十七辆急救车送给西班牙民主军队和与他们并肩作战反对法西斯主义的国际纵队。
    “西班牙的土地”在日内瓦国际联盟会场上放映时，用活生生的事实令人信服地向代表们证实了西班牙共和国外交部长的发言，当时他为了西班牙人民的正义事业进行了呼吁。
    接着，“西班牙的土地”到了许多国家，使得许许多多人们听到了要对法西斯主义保持警惕的呼声和西班牙人民的斗争故事。西班牙人民生活在西班牙的土地上，这块土地理应属于他们，因为他们在这块土地上劳动，现在他们又正在为了争取自己国家的自由独立和占有这土地而进行斗争。
    当然法西斯检查制度不允许这部传递正义信息的电影到希特勒德国和日本去放映。
    在我的祖国荷兰，这部影片在1937年放映时获得了成功，当时只有一部拷贝保存在荷兰。1940年，当希特勒军队侵入荷兰的时候，他们带着一份要立即加以没收的影片的清单，列在这份清单的首位的就是“西班牙的土地”。
    过了许多年，在第二次世界大战结束以后，苏联把苏军解放柏林时缴获的前戈培尔国家影片资料馆的藏片移交给德意志民主共和国。就在这个资料馆的藏片室中，我们找到了法西斯军队在阿姆斯特丹盗去的“西班牙的土地”完整无损的旧拷贝。
    现在，这部影片即将在北京上映，它虽然已经失去了在摄成的时候所具有的作为战斗性纪录片的当前政治价值，但是正像许多纪录片一样，它现在具有了作为历史文件，甚至是代表人民呼声的有生命的历史文件的第二种价值。
    它使得英勇的西班牙人民的故事在中国观众心目中有了真实的感觉。在看了这部影片之后，中国观众可以更清楚地认识到目前巴塞罗那工人的英勇罢工，西班牙革命的学生运动，以及西班牙共产党反对佛朗哥恐怖统治的一切行动都是这个斗争的继续。
    “印度尼西亚的召唤”这部影片的生命甚至比“西班牙的土地”更加富于戏剧性。摄制这部影片本身就是一种困难的冒险。
    这部纪录片是从报道1945年澳大利亚悉尼港口的一次罢工的一些新闻纪录镜头中产生的。这次罢工事先没有预料到会这么严重地发展，事过境迁之后，我们可以说，正是历史本身为这部以工人阶级的国际团结为主题的影片写下了它的故事。
    当然，澳大利亚当局千方百计地要阻止这部反殖民主义影片的摄制。我现在还清楚地记得女摄影师玛丽恩·米歇尔英勇地进行拍摄的情况，也记得澳大利亚码头罢工工人为了保护我们的拍摄工作不受到悉尼港口警察的破坏所给予的有效协助。
    在群众压力下，新生婴儿“印度尼西亚的召唤”通过了澳大利亚的检查当局。更困难的是把这部影片运到其他国家去放映。为了替这部短而有力的影片取得出口执照而进行的斗争，曾经在堪培拉的澳大利亚议会中引起了一次政治事件。最后终于领到了出口执照，这部影片的拷贝到了欧洲和美洲。除了英语版以外，还用小型胶片复制了马来语版的拷贝。
    这时候的困难是用什么办法把这些拷贝运到印度尼西亚去，因为荷兰殖民舰队当时封锁了印度尼西亚群岛。几部马来语版的拷贝用飞机从澳大利亚运到了新加坡，在一个漆黑的夜晚，一艘小船闯过了封锁线，经过苏门答腊到达了爪哇岛的海岸。
    我们直到很久以后才知道有一部拷贝安然无恙地到了印度尼西亚。这部拷贝曾经广泛地在晚上露天放映，有时候是同时在爪哇各个城市和乡村中向成千上万的人放映，报道了印度尼西亚、澳大利亚、中国、印度、马来亚五国工人、码头工人和海员的声势浩大的声援罢工的真相。这次罢工阻止了澳大利亚港口的装了武器和弹药的船只驶向印度尼西亚去摧毁那个年轻的共和国。
    荷兰的宣传机构对八千万印度尼西亚人民说，世界上没有人关心他们争取独立的斗争。这部影片有力地驳倒了荷兰在印度尼西亚的宣传机构的谎言。
    “你们不是孤立无援的，”这部影片却用确实的事实令人信服地告诉他们，“看一看澳大利亚发生的事情吧，印度尼西亚向它的朋友们求援并不是没有结果的。”
    这样，这部从澳大利亚偷送到爪哇，放映二十分钟的短短的影片出乎意料地成了这个年轻的共和国有力的斗争武器，帮助动员了新的战士为印度尼西亚的独立进行斗争。
    “印度尼西亚的召唤”这部影片产自印度尼西亚和澳大利亚海员的日常斗争，摄成之后，又回到了斗争的现实中去，甚至在这个斗争中起了一种积极的作用——不过是以它自己的方式。
    纪录片在精神上和感情上的影响是不能低估的，最近几年来，全世界许多纪录片制片人的作品都证明了这一点。
    我们同人民日常生活的直接亲密接触，使我们纪录片摄制者获得了力量，使我们知道了我们的责任：我们必须使用这种力量为人民的最高理想和愿望服务。
    同我们年轻的电影艺术的另一支流——故事片一起，我们必须运用各自的特殊的创作方法去寻求自己的道路，将生动的鼓舞人心的电影语言表达出来。
    我完全相信，年轻的中国纪录片摄制者会创造出这种影片来的，因为，他们在掌握了他们的艺术和技术以后，他们是有——而且在他们的周围看到和感受到——现代中国的活力的；他们会倾听他们祖国的心脏的跳动。我相信，他们的影片会现实地生动地反映他们的人民对社会主义事业的热情和他们要求和平的坚强意志。
    这种影片——民族艺术的表现形式，不但能够为中国人民服务，而且也能够鼓舞其他国家的广大观众。
    我们的电影语言也是一种国际语言，它必须促进各国人民的了解，巩固他们的真正友谊。朋友们的手紧握在一起就是一股强大的力量，我们必须用这种力量来保卫世界和平。
