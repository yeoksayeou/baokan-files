Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Responding to the State Council's call to increase coal production, coal miners across the country produced more than 450,000 tons of raw coal during the Spring Festival holiday. Among them, state-owned coal mines produced more than 380,000 tons, exceeding the Ministry of Coal Industry's expected figure by more than 63,000 tons; local state-owned coal mines in eight provinces and regions, including Liaoning, Shanxi, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia, produced more than 60,000 tons.

　　The vast majority of coal mines exceeded their original production plans during this Spring Festival holiday production increase. The mines under the Harbin Bureau produced nearly 100,000 tons, exceeding the plan by 19.7%; the mines under the Jinan Bureau produced more than 57,000 tons, exceeding the plan by 13%; the output of the Jingxi Coal Mine more than doubled the plan; the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine even created the highest daily output record in recent years, increasing raw coal production by more than 10,000 tons.

　　During the Spring Festival holiday production, the attendance rate of workers in various mines was very high. The attendance rate of workers in the Jiawang Coal Mine reached 100%; although there was heavy snow for several days in the Jiaozuo mining area, the workers in the four mines under its jurisdiction were fully staffed every shift. Twenty-two newly married miners in the Wangfeng Mine also worked as usual.

　　During the Spring Festival, all personnel of the Ministry of Coal Industry and regional administrations only took one day off, and worked as usual for the remaining two days, just like the miners.

    煤矿工人的光荣——春节采煤四十五万吨
    新华社4日讯　全国煤矿职工响应国务院增产原煤号召，在春节假期中共为国家增产了四十五万多吨原煤。其中，国营煤矿生产了三十八万多吨，比煤炭工业部预计的数字超过了六万三千多吨；辽宁、山西、河北、内蒙古等八个省区的地方国营煤矿生产了六万多吨。
    绝大多数煤矿在这次春节假期增产中都超过了原来的产量计划。哈尔滨管理局所属各矿生产了近十万吨，超过计划19.7％；济南管理局所属各矿生产了五万七千多吨，超过计划13％；京西煤矿的产量超过计划一倍以上；阜新海州露天矿甚至创造了几年来最高日产量纪录，增产原煤达一万多吨。
    在春节假期生产中，各矿工人出勤率都很高。贾汪煤矿工人出勤率达百分之一百；焦作矿区虽然连日大雪，所属四个矿的工人都是班班满员，王封矿二十二名新结婚的矿工，也都照常出勤。
    春节期间，煤炭工业部和各地区管理局的全体人员，都和矿工一样只放一天假，其余两天照常工作。
