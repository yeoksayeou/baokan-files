    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th – The North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau obtained proven reserves of 5.875 billion tons in the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan. This figure reaches 103.3% of the target stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. The passive situation of geological exploration lagging behind coal mine construction in the Shanxi Province area under the Bureau's responsibility has been fundamentally changed.

    The reserves provided by the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau in the past four years not only guarantee the reserves needed for the seventeen pairs of mines restored and rebuilt in the North China region during the First Five-Year Plan, but are also sufficient to build another fifty-five pairs of new mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons in this region. These mines can operate for sixty years.

    In the past four years, in order to find underground coal deposits, geological exploration personnel have conducted large-scale detailed, thorough, and general surveys and explorations in all old mining areas in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, and some old mining areas in Hebei. The footprints of geological exploration personnel have been left almost everywhere. They have completed a total drilling workload of more than 400,000 meters, measured the geological conditions of more than 16,000 square kilometers and the topographic conditions of 2,465 square kilometers.

    In 1953, this bureau had only more than 800 employees and 24 drilling rigs. Now, it has eleven geological exploration, topographic surveying, geological surveying, and water source teams, and the total number of employees has increased to 9,000; the number of main equipment such as drilling rigs has also increased to more than 100, and some new equipment such as electrical measuring instruments has also been equipped.

    Due to the rapid improvement in technology, this new exploration team will undertake greater geological exploration tasks this year.

    华北已探明煤矿储量五十八亿吨
    足供七十多对矿井开采六十年
    新华社太原10日电　华北煤田地质勘探局在第一个五年计划的前四年中，获得精查储量五十八亿七千五百万吨。这个数字达到五年计划规定数字的103.3％。这个局所负责勘探的山西省地区，地质勘探赶不上煤矿建设的被动情况已经有了根本改变。
    华北煤田地质勘探局在过去四年中所提供的储量，不仅保证了华北地区第一个五年计划中恢复、改建的十七对矿井所需要的储量，还足够在这个地区再新建五十五对年产九十万吨的矿井，这些矿井可以开采六十年。
    四年来，地质勘探人员为寻找地下煤藏，在山西、内蒙古的全部老矿区、河北的部分老矿区进行了大规模的精查、详查和普查勘探。几乎到处都留下了地质勘探人员的足迹。他们共完成了四十多万公尺的钻探工作量，测量了一万六千多平方公里的地质状况和二千四百六十五平方公里的地形状况。
    1953年，这个局只有八百多个职工和二十四台钻机。现在，已经拥有十一个地质勘探、地形测量、地质测量和水源队，职工总数已经增加到九千人；钻机等主要设备也增加到一百多台，还装备了电测仪等一些新型的设备。
    这支新生的勘探队伍由于技术上的迅速提高，今年将担负更大的地质勘探任务。
