Xinhua News Agency, 18th: "We textile workers should not only save cotton in production but also take the lead in saving cotton cloth in our lives," said Xu Shumei, a thrifty female worker in the fine yarn workshop of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, to reporters. She usually only has two sets of old outerwear to alternate wearing. She originally planned to make two sets of floral fabric clothes this summer, but since learning about the difficulty in supplying raw cotton and cotton cloth in production, she decided not to.

Many workers, cadres, and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Beijing plan to use existing clothing as much as possible this year, making fewer or no new clothes. Ma Xishan, 65, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Finance Bureau, has always been hardworking and simple. The old cotton quilt he brought from the liberated area has been used for twelve years and is still in use. He has been wearing a cotton-padded coat for three or four years, and the cuffs of his pants have been patched. He said he can wear them for a few more winters. Ma Xishan's wife, Zhang Suting, is also an elderly person who often pays attention to saving. Her cotton-padded jacket is an old uniform worn by her son. When reporters visited Zhang Suting, she was cutting up an old dress of her eldest niece, Yang Senlin, preparing to remake it for her six-year-old niece, Yang Jiarui. She said, "I want to try my best to remake or mend some old clothes for adults and children, and strive not to buy or buy less new cotton cloth this year."

In the Beijing Post Office, there is an old employee, Zhang Guozhen, who has worked in postal services for more than 30 years. He usually cherishes his clothes, alternating between new and old clothes, washing and changing them frequently, and often wearing a piece of cloth clothing for many years. The blue shirt he is wearing now has been worn for seven years, and after changing the white collar, it still doesn't look worn out. He has accumulated some old and worn-out clothes in the past and plans to mend them and wear them again.

Wang Yuxun, a captain in a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, plans to wear old clothes as much as possible this year, except for adding a few single garments for his children and wife, and not go to the market to buy cotton cloth.

    北京有些职工、干部、军人
    今年准备少添新衣
    新华社18日讯　“我们纺织工人不仅在生产中要节约棉花，在生活中也要带头节约棉布。”国营北京第一棉纺织厂细纱车间一位生活俭朴的女工徐淑美对记者说。她平常只有两套旧外衣轮换着穿，原来打算今年夏天做两套花布衣服，自从在生产中知道原棉、棉布供应有困难以后，决定不做了。
    北京有不少职工、干部和解放军军官，打算今年尽可能地利用旧有服装，少制或不制新衣。六十五岁的北京市财政局副局长马溪山，一贯艰苦朴素，他从解放区带来的旧棉被已经盖了十二年，现在仍在使用。他穿了三、四年的一身棉衣，裤脚已经补过了，他说还可以再穿几个冬天。马溪山的爱人张素亭也是一位经常注意节约的老人。她的棉袄套衣是一件她儿子穿过的旧制服。在记者访问张素亭的时候，她正在剪裁大外甥女杨森林的一件旧衣服，准备改制了给六岁的小外甥女杨嘉瑞穿。她说，我要尽量地为大人、孩子改制或缝补一些旧衣服，争取今年不买或少买新棉布。
    在北京市邮局里，有一位作了三十多年邮政工作的老职员张国桢，平时很爱惜衣服，新旧衣服倒换着穿，勤洗勤换，常常一件布衣服穿好多年。他现在穿的一件蓝衬衣，已经穿了七年，换了白领子，还不显得破旧。他过去积存了一些破旧衣服，准备把它们整补一下再穿。
    中国人民解放军驻北京某部上尉军官王玉珣，打算今年除了给孩子、爱人增添几件单衣外，尽量穿旧衣服，不到市场上去买棉布了。
