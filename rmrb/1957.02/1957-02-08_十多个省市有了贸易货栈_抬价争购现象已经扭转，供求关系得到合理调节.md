    Trade Warehouses Established in More Than a Dozen Provinces and Cities
    Panic Buying Reversed, Supply and Demand Rationally Regulated

    (Our Dispatch) Trade warehouses have been widely restored and established in more than a dozen provinces and cities including Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. According to incomplete statistics from Hubei and Henan provinces alone, more than 1,200 trade warehouses have been restored and established. Most trade warehouses offer attentive service and charge low handling fees; some warehouses also provide accommodation for farmers, and therefore have won praise from the masses.

    These trade warehouses are playing an increasingly significant role in the market. In Beijing, Henan, Shandong and other places, some warehouses, when the market demand for certain commodities exceeds supply, adopt methods of rationally allocating goods, based on the urgency of each unit's needs and the availability of goods. The Yongdingmen Dry and Fresh Goods Warehouse in Beijing, when the supply of certain commodities fell short of demand, convened state-owned commercial enterprises, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint state-private stores, and small vendors to discuss the situation and, through consultation, reversed the phenomenon of price gouging and competitive purchasing. The warehouses also established contact with the demanding units, regularly learning what goods they needed, how much they needed, and when they needed them. They also actively contacted the producing areas to organize sources of goods. When the supply of certain commodities exceeded demand, the warehouses actively helped sellers promote sales to government agencies, schools, state-private enterprises, and other units; if there was still a surplus after local sales, they promoted sales to other areas. For example, the Yangming Town Warehouse in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, mobilized small vendors to promote the sale of more than 1.5 million jin of watermelons to other areas.

    Through their business activities, trade warehouses have largely guided the healthy development of farmers' trade. In many areas, at the beginning of the opening of free markets, some agricultural cooperatives and farmers blindly rushed to large cities to transport and sell products, only to suffer losses. After the establishment of trade warehouses, this phenomenon has greatly decreased. Agricultural cooperatives and farmers trade at the warehouses, and small vendors and state-private stores purchase goods at the warehouses, which has reversed the phenomenon of demanding units raising prices to snap up goods from agricultural cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives blindly transporting and selling goods.

    Trade warehouses have also played a coordinating role in assisting market management agencies in managing the market. In Jiaomei Town in Longxi County, Fujian Province, and Huailai County, Hebei Province, some warehouses assist market management agencies in understanding market conditions. If they encounter farmers selling state-monopolized goods (such as grain, etc.) or state-unified purchase goods (such as mandarin oranges, etc.) during the unified purchase period, they promptly report to the local finance and trade team, and the Market Management Committee comes forward to carry out appropriate management. This can both supervise agricultural cooperatives and farmers in implementing state policies, and assist market management agencies in grasping market conditions, so as to better coordinate and manage the free market under state leadership.

    十多个省市有了贸易货栈
    抬价争购现象已经扭转，供求关系得到合理调节
    本报讯　河北、山东、河南等十多个省、市已经普遍恢复和建立了贸易货栈。仅据湖北、河南两省不完全统计，已恢复和建立的贸易货栈即有一千二百多个。大部分贸易货栈服务周到，收取手续费不多；有的货栈还负责招待农民食宿，因此，获得了群众的好评。
    这些贸易货栈在市场上所起的作用日益显著。北京、河南、山东等地有些货栈，在市场上某些商品供不应求的时候，即采取合理分配货源的办法，根据各需货单位需货的缓急，结合货源情况，进行合理分配。北京永定门干鲜货栈，曾在某些商品供不应求的时候，召集国营商业，供销社，公私合营商店和小商贩等需货单位座谈，采用协商的办法，扭转了抬价争购的现象。货栈同需货单位还建立了联系，经常了解他们需要什么货，需要多少，什么时候需要。并积极同产区联系，组织货源。当某些商品供过于求的时候，货栈就积极帮助卖主到机关、学校、公私企业等单位推销；在当地推销后仍有剩余部分，即向外地推销。如浙江余姚县阳明镇货栈，曾发动小商贩向外地推销西瓜一百五十多万斤。
    贸易货栈通过自己的业务活动在很大程度上引导农民贸易健康开展。不少地区在开放自由市场之初，有些农业社和农民盲目跑大城市运销产品，反而受到损失。贸易货栈成立后，这种现象大大减少。农业社和农民到货栈交易，小商贩，公私合营商店等需货单位到货栈进货，这就扭转了需货单位到农业社抬价抢购，农业社盲目运销的现象。
    贸易货栈对协助市场管理机关管理市场亦起了配合作用。福建省龙溪县角美镇和河北省怀来县等地，有些货栈协助市场管理机关了解市场情况，遇到农民在统购期间出售国家统购物资（如粮食等）或国家统一收购物资（如柑桔等），就及时报告当地财贸小组，由市场管理委员会出面进行适当管理，这样既可以监督农业社和农民执行国家政策，又可以协助市场管理机关掌握市场情况，以便更好地配合管理国家领导下的自由市场。（李黎）
