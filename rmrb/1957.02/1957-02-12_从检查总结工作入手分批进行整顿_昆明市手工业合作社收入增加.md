Xinhua News Agency report: Kunming's Handicraft Production Cooperatives are being rectified in batches. Cooperatives that have undergone rectification have seen production development, increased income for members, and greater convenience for the masses.

Kunming is the most concentrated city for handicrafts in Yunnan Province. During the high tide of cooperativization last year, handicraftsmen in the city merged to form 167 cooperatives. Even some handicraftsmen with different production natures or suitable for small cooperatives were blindly concentrated, causing many difficulties in operation and management. Some cooperatives reduced the variety of products and lowered the quality. In several clothing production cooperatives with three or four hundred people, the rework rate once reached 50%. Some cooperatives reduced output and decreased the income of members, which affected the consolidation and development of the cooperatives. The Kunming Municipal Handicraft leadership analyzed the above situation and decided to conduct a general rectification of the cooperatives based on the characteristics of handicraft production. The rectification starts with inspection and summarization, finding the main problems of each cooperative and solving them. For example, the Oilcloth and Felt Production Cooperative was formed by merging two small cooperatives with completely different production natures, located more than twenty miles apart, making management extremely inconvenient. After being divided into oilcloth and felt cooperatives, production increased by 20.6% compared to before, and the average monthly wage of members also increased from 42 yuan to more than 50 yuan. During the rectification of the Fourth Ironware Production Cooperative, production and repair were separated, and four repair points were set up in the urban area to facilitate residents' repair of ironware. Some clothing cooperatives that were too large in the past were divided into several small cooperatives, and the rework rate was reduced.

Some cooperatives with chaotic production management also focused on solving problems in production. After solving problems such as unsound organization, lack of production planning, and unreasonable labor organization, the Fifth Spinning Production Cooperative increased its daily output value by 20% compared to before the rectification, reduced the defective rate by 40%, and reversed the past situation of losses. In the past, the leaders of the Machine Repair and Manufacturing Production Cooperative had a poor democratic style, which affected production. In this rectification, leaders were re-elected and democratic management was improved, which enabled the enthusiasm of the members to be brought into play, thereby successfully completing the long-standing backlog of processing orders.

At present, the first batch of 48 cooperatives has completed rectification, and the second batch of rectification work has also begun. It is expected that all handicraft production cooperatives can be rectified by the end of the first quarter.

    从检查总结工作入手分批进行整顿
    昆明市手工业合作社收入增加
    据新华社讯　昆明市手工业生产合作社正在分批进行整顿。经过整顿的合作社，生产发展，社员收入增加，并且便利了群众。
    昆明市是云南省手工业最集中的城市。在去年合作化高潮中，全市手工业者曾合并组成为一百六十七个合作社，甚至连一些生产性质不同或宜于办小社的手工业者也盲目集中起来，造成经营管理中许多困难。有的合作社产品品种减少，质量下降。几个拥有三四百人的服装生产合作社，返工率一度达到50％。有的合作社产量降低，社员收入减少，这些都影响了合作社的巩固和发展。昆明市手工业领导部门分析了上述情况，决定根据手工业生产的特点普遍进行一次整社。整社是从检查总结工作入手，找出各个社的主要问题，加以解决。如油布毛毡生产合作社是由两个生产性质完全不同的小社合并起来的，相距二十多里，管理极为不便，划分为油布和毛毡两个社后，生产就比前增加20.6％，社员每月平均工资也由四十二元增加为五十多元。第四铁业生产合作社在整社中，把生产和修理分开，并且在市区设立四处修补点，便于居民修补铁器。过去一些规模过大的服装社，分别划为若干小社后，返工率都降低。
    有些生产管理混乱的合作社还集中解决生产中的问题。第五机纺生产合作社在解决了机构不健全、生产无计划、劳动组织不合理等问题以后，日产值比整社前增加20％，次品率降低40％，扭转了过去亏本的局面。机器修造生产合作社过去社干部民主作风差，影响生产。这次整社中改选领导，健全民主管理，使社员的积极性得到发挥，从而顺利完成了长期积压的加工订货任务。
    目前，第一批四十八个社已经整顿结束，第二批整社工作也已经开始，预计在第一季度内全部手工业生产合作社可以整顿完毕。
