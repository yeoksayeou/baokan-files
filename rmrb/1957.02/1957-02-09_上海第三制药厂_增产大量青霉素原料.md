    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th - This January, the state-owned Shanghai Third Pharmaceutical Factory overproduced more than 200 billion units of penicillin raw material than planned. These raw materials, after processing, can be made into approximately 700,000 bottles of 300,000-unit penicillin oil injection. The fineness, purity, and content of penicillin were all 100% qualified this month, and there were no quality accidents involving bacterial contamination throughout the month. This is a new phenomenon that this pharmaceutical factory has never experienced before.
    By the end of January, the Shanghai Third Pharmaceutical Factory had already completed the state-mandated penicillin production target for the first Five-Year Plan period ahead of schedule.
    Currently, the factory's employees are studying ways to increase production and save resources by further improving production technology and product quality.

    上海第三制药厂
    增产大量青霉素原料
    据新华社上海8日电　今年头一个月，国营上海第三制药厂比计划多生产了两千多亿单位的青霉素原料，这些原料经过加工可以制成约七十万瓶三十万单位的青霉素油剂。青霉素的细度、纯度、含量等在这个月也都百分之百合格，全月没有发生染菌的质量事故。这是这个制药厂过去所没有过的新气象。
    到1月底，上海第三制药厂已经提前完成了国家规定的第一个五年计划期间青霉素产量的任务。
    目前，厂里职工正在研究进一步用改进生产技术和提高产品质量的方法来增产节约。
