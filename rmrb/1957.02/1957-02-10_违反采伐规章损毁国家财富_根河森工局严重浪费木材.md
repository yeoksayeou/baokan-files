Violating Logging Regulations Damages National Wealth
Genhe Forestry Bureau Seriously Wastes Timber

(Our report) According to the Inner Mongolia Daily, the Genhe Forestry Bureau in Inner Mongolia has very serious violations of logging regulations.

In 1956, this forestry bureau opened more than 300 logging areas and harvested 250,000 cubic meters of timber. Violating regulations, they destroyed more than half of the reserved strips in these 300+ logging areas. In some reserved strips, even excellent trees were cut down, seriously affecting forest regeneration.

The disregard for preserving mother trees and damaging young trees is even more shocking. To facilitate natural regeneration in the logging areas, the state-owned forest's main logging trial regulations stipulate that 15 to 20 healthy mother trees of the main tree species should be retained per hectare and evenly distributed in the logging area. In most logging areas of the Genhe Forestry Bureau, the trees retained are mostly diseased, rotten, or immature trees. There are many young trees in the logging areas, but in all logging areas, more than 80% or even 100% of the healthy young trees were damaged, which is a huge and irreparable loss.

According to regulations, for large-diameter trees with a diameter at breast height of 30 cm or more, the stump height should not exceed one-third of the diameter of the cut surface; for small-diameter trees, the stump height should not exceed 10 cm. However, the average stump height of the Genhe Forestry Bureau exceeds 10 cm. In 1956 alone, more than 220 cubic meters of timber was wasted due to stump heights exceeding the stipulated height. Due to unreasonable afforestation and arbitrary discarding, a lot of economically valuable timber was also wasted. According to the inspection of sixteen logging areas, more than 2,800 cubic meters of timber were wasted. Preliminary estimates indicate that more than 30,000 cubic meters of timber was wasted in this way in the 300+ logging areas. If all these timbers were made into railway sleepers, they could lay about 100 kilometers of railway, worth more than 2.5 million yuan.

### 违反采伐规章损毁国家财富  根河森工局严重浪费木材

    违反采伐规章损毁国家财富
    根河森工局严重浪费木材
    本报讯　据内蒙古日报消息，内蒙古根河森林工业局违章采伐木材的现象十分严重。
    1956年，这个森工局开辟了三百多个采伐带，采伐了二十五万立方公尺木材。他们违反规定，在三百多个采伐带中，破坏了半数以上的保留带。有的保留带内的优良树木也被砍伐了，严重地影响了森林的更新。
    不注意保留母树和伤害幼树的现象更为惊人。为了使伐区天然更新，国有林主伐试行规程规定，每公顷应当保留生长健壮的主要树种母树十五至二十株，并均匀分布在伐区上。根河森工局多数采伐带里保留的多是病腐或发育不成熟的树木。采伐带里的幼树是很多的，但是，所有采伐带里的80％以上甚至100％生长健壮的幼树被伤害了，这是无法挽回的巨大损失。
    按规定，胸高直径在三十公分以上的大径木，伐根高度不应当超过径断面的三分之一；小径木的伐根高度不应当超过十公分。根河森工局的伐根高度平均却超过十公分。1956年一年，因伐根超过规定高度，就浪费木材二百二十多立方公尺。由于造林不合理和任意丢弃，也浪费了不少有利用价值的经济材。据十六个采伐带的检查，浪费的木材有二千八百多立方公尺。初步推算，在三百多个采伐带里被这样浪费的木材达三万多立方公尺。这些木材若全部制成枕木，可以铺设一百公里左右的铁路，价值二百五十多万元。
