Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 11th – Negotiations between Jordanian and British delegations regarding the termination of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty resumed on the 10th in Amman, the capital of Jordan. These negotiations began on February 4th and adjourned on February 6th.

    According to foreign news agencies, the Jordanian delegation requested at the meeting the immediate publication of a joint communiqué announcing the termination of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty within one month, followed by negotiations on the details of the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan and the abolition of British military bases in Jordan. However, the British delegation insisted on reaching an agreement on all detailed issues before issuing the communiqué.

    Meanwhile, Jordanian public opinion expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's deliberate delay in the negotiations. Jordan's national radio station said on the 9th that since the first day of the negotiations, Jordanians had been expecting the publication of a joint statement announcing the end of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, the withdrawal of British troops, and the abolition of British-occupied bases. But a week has passed, and people are still waiting for the statement. The public is beginning to feel uneasy about this delay. The broadcast pointed out that the responsibility for this delay naturally lies with the British delegation, because the Jordanian delegation is very eager to reach an agreement as soon as possible.

    英国故意拖延谈判
    约旦要求一个月内停止英约条约
    据新华社11日讯　安曼消息：约旦和英国的代表团10日在约旦首都安曼恢复关于结束英约条约的谈判。这个谈判是在2月4日开始的，后来在2月6日休会。
    据外国通讯社报道，在会上，约旦代表团要求立即发表联合公报，宣布在一个月内停止英约条约，然后再谈判关于英军撤出约旦和取消英国在约旦的军事基地的细节。但是英国代表团却坚持要在一切细节问题上达成协议后才发表公报。
    同时，约旦舆论对于英国在谈判中故意拖延表示不满。约旦的国家广播电台9日说，自从谈判的第一天起，约旦人就在期望发表联合声明宣布结束英约条约，撤退英国军队，取消英国所占领的基地。但是一星期过去了，人们还在盼望着声明。公众对于这种拖延，开始感到不安。广播指出，这种拖延的责任当然是在英国代表团身上，因为约旦代表团是十分希望尽早达成协议的。
