Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 9th. The Budapest Fifth District Executive Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party convened a meeting of party and non-party intellectual activists on the evening of the 6th. Kolloi, a member of the Provisional Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party, attended the meeting and answered questions raised at the meeting.

    The Party and the government have always distinguished peaceful demonstrators from counter-revolutionaries.

    Kolloi first answered the question of why there appeared to be "inconsistencies" and a "leftward turn" in the speeches of Party and government leaders and in Party and government documents. He said that there was no contradiction in the Party's and government's past and present statements regarding the nature of the October events. We have always described the armed rebellion as counter-revolutionary, and we have distinguished peaceful demonstrators from counter-revolutionaries. Our documents point out both the mistakes of the leaders of the Hungarian Workers' Party and the activities of the Nagy group and domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, in essence, there are no inconsistencies. Of course, it is also necessary to consider what issues are mainly emphasized in a statement, and not to emphasize all issues equally. At the same time, it is necessary to consider that as we obtain more and more materials, the issue becomes clearer and clearer, and therefore certain issues can be stated more precisely later. Telling the truth is not the same as "turning to the left."

    The October events could have been avoided. Delay in solving the problems gave the enemy an opportunity. The Nagy group caused ideological confusion.

    Next, Kolloi answered the question of whether the October events could have been avoided. He said that we believe they could have been avoided. Regardless of the good intentions of those who raise this question, they are actually saying, intentionally or unintentionally, that the counter-revolutionary rebellion improved our situation, and therefore there was justification for carrying out the armed rebellion. But in fact, if there had been no counter-revolutionary rebellion, we would have been able to move forward faster and more peacefully. At the Party's Central Plenary Session in July of last year, a series of important resolutions were adopted, and Rakosi was replaced. The voices of comrades in the Party leadership who opposed dogmatism and sectarianism became more and more weighty. In the Party's central organs, advanced party schools, and party organizations at all levels, the calls for change became more and more obvious. Party life began to be more democratic than before. In addition, a resolution on intellectuals was also made. Originally, it was possible to solve the most pressing problems according to the principles of the Party. Because there were many delays in taking the above measures, and the problems were not solved for a long time, this gave the enemy an opportunity. However, the enemy became anxious only when they saw that the Party could correct its mistakes. At the same time, the Nagy group caused widespread ideological confusion. Every enemy of Hungary regarded Nagy as a banner. They also pretended to be "fighters for Lenin's norms." Later, they called the counter-revolution a "national revolution," and nationalism and chauvinism "patriotism," and anti-Soviet incitement "defending independence." They also said they "supported socialism" and recognized land reform and nationalization. These were all disguises. The Nagy group became more and more right-leaning. He did not rely on the Party, on the revolutionary forces of Hungary, on the socialist camp, or on the Soviet Union. Instead, at a critical moment, he canceled the Warsaw Pact, declared "neutrality," and demanded that the United Nations intervene. What is this if not betrayal?

    The establishment of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the request for Soviet military assistance were both necessary. Only by wiping out the counter-revolutionary forces can the current state of emergency be ended.

    Regarding whether the conditions for stabilizing order were met on November 4th of last year, that is, whether it was necessary to organize a new government and request Soviet military assistance, Kolloi said that it was very obvious that both of these things were necessary under the circumstances at that time. The Nagy government had proved to be weak and incapable, and had no intention of opposing the counter-revolutionary offensive. In fact, it was equivalent to laying down its arms in front of the counter-revolution. Of course, in this case, order could also be stabilized; but what kind of order would it be? The Party was disintegrating, and nearly twenty-five open or covert right-wing parties had begun their organizational work, and there was the threat of Western imperialist intervention. Right-wing elements gradually gained a major position in the government. Therefore, this could only be the stabilization of counter-revolutionary order. In this situation, the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government was established, and Soviet troops, who were carrying out proletarian internationalist obligations, were requested to provide assistance.

    Someone asked how long the current state of emergency would last, and Kolloi replied that this special state was not created by ourselves, but was caused by the counter-revolutionary offensive. Only by wiping out the counter-revolutionary forces can this state of emergency be ended.

    Now democracy has been established for the people, and a strong dictatorship has been established over the counter-revolutionaries. The Party will always be the leading force.

    Kolloi continued, "Someone asked whether this 'hard-line policy' can be called a restoration of 'Rakosi-ism.' Our answer is a firm 'no.' Everyone knows that in the past few years, the proletarian dictatorship was not fully and correctly implemented in our country. Neither was true democracy practiced for the working masses, nor was dictatorship practiced over the enemies. Now democracy has been established for the people, and a strong dictatorship has been established over the counter-revolutionaries. This is not a step backward, not a restoration of old mistakes, but a big step forward on the road to correcting mistakes."

    Regarding the Party's organizational problems, Kolloi said that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party will be a united and firm Party in organization, politics, and ideology. It should be considered that these Party members who have joined the Party have joined it in the most difficult days and when the most courage was needed. In the future, there will be many changes in our Party and in our country, but one thing is certain: the Party will always be the leading force.

    The Party and the government believe that most intellectuals are not counter-revolutionaries, but honest patriots. Many intellectuals have now participated in the formulation of the government's program.

    Regarding the situation of intellectuals, he said that although there has been, and still is, some confusion among intellectuals, the Party and the government still believe that most intellectuals are not counter-revolutionary elements, but honest patriots.

    What we need are intellectuals who grasp the essence and spirit of Marxism-Leninism and can apply it to the specific realities of Hungary.

    Many intellectuals have now participated in the formulation of the government's program. Our plan is to organize various specialized committees in various departments to absorb the participation of intellectuals.

    匈社会主义工人党布达佩斯组织召开知识分子积极分子大会
    科洛伊解答有关十月事件的几个问题
    新华社布达佩斯9日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党布达佩斯第五区执行委员会6日晚召开了党和非党的知识分子积极分子大会。社会主义工人党临时中央执行委员会委员科洛伊出席了这次会议，并且就会上提出的问题作了答复。
    党和政府一直把和平示威的群众区别于反革命分子。
    科洛伊首先答复关于在党政领导人的讲话和党与政府的文件中为什么有前后“不一致”和“向左转”的现象这个问题。他说，关于十月事件的性质，党和政府过去和现在的声明中并没有任何矛盾。我们一直把武装暴乱说成是反革命，把和平示威的群众区别于反革命分子。我们的文件中既指出了劳动人民党领导者的错误，也指出了纳吉集团和国内外反革命分子的活动，因此，从实质上说，并没有前后不一致的地方。当然，还要看到在一个声明中主要着重讲什么问题，而不能对各种问题都同样强调。同时，还要考虑到，当我们获得越来越多的材料时，问题就越来越清楚，因此后来就可以把某些问题说得更确切些。把真理说出来不等于是“向左转”。
    十月事件是可以避免的。解决问题方面的拖延给了敌人可乘之隙。纳吉集团引起了思想混乱。
    接着科洛伊回答了关于十月事件是否可以避免的问题。他说，我们认为是可以避免的。提出这个问题的人不论动机如何善良，实际上是有意无意地在说：反革命暴乱改进了我们的局势，因此进行武装暴乱是有理由的。但事实上，如果没有反革命暴乱，我们就能够更快地和和平地前进。在去年7月党的中央全会上，通过了一系列重要的决议，撤换了拉科西。党的领导中反对教条主义和宗派主义错误的同志的话变得越来越有分量。在党中央机构、高级党校和党的各级组织中，要求转变的呼声越来越明显。党内生活开始较前民主，此外，还作出了关于知识分子的决议。本来，按照党的原则，是可以解决那些最迫切的问题的。由于在采取上述措施的时候，有很多拖延现象，问题长期没有得到解决，从而给了敌人以可乘之隙。但是，敌人是在看到党能够纠正错误的时候才着急起来的。在这同时，纳吉集团又引起了广泛的思想混乱。匈牙利的每一个敌人都把纳吉当作旗帜。他们也装出“列宁准则的斗士”的样子。后来他们又把反革命说成是“民族革命”，把民族主义和沙文主义说成是“爱国主义”，把反苏挑拨说成是“保卫独立”。他们也说“拥护社会主义”，承认土地改革和国有化。这些都是伪装。纳吉集团越来越右倾，他不是依靠党，依靠匈牙利革命力量，依靠社会主义阵营，依靠苏联，而是在危急的时刻取消了华沙条约，宣布“中立”，要求联合国进行干涉。这不是叛变又是什么呢？
    成立工农革命政府和请求苏军援助都是需要的。只有把反革命势力消灭干净，目前的非常状态才能结束。
    关于去年11月4日是否具备了安定秩序的条件，也就是说，需不需要组织新政府和要求苏军援助的问题，科洛伊说，很显然，在当时的情况下，这两件事都是需要的。纳吉政府已经证明软弱无力，根本不想反对反革命的进攻，实际上等于在反革命面前放下武器。当然在这种情况下，也可以使秩序安定；但是，这是什么样的秩序？党瓦解了，有差不多二十五个公开或隐蔽的右翼政党开始了组织工作，存在着西方帝国主义的干涉的威胁。右翼分子在政府中逐渐取得了主要地位。因此，这只能是反革命的秩序安定。在这种情况下，才成立了工农革命政府，并且请求执行无产阶级国际主义义务的苏军给予援助。
    有人问，目前这种非常状态将要延续多久，科洛伊答复说，这种特殊状态不是我们自己造成的，而是反革命的进攻所引起的，只有把反革命势力消灭干净，这种非常状态才能结束。
    现在对人民建立了民主，对反革命建立了强硬的专政。党将永远是领导力量。
    科洛伊接着说，有人问，这种“强硬政策”是否可以称为“拉科西主义”的复辟，我们的答复是坚决的，否定的。大家知道，过去几年，在我国没有完全正确地贯彻无产阶级专政，既没有对劳动群众实行真正的民主，也没有对敌人实行专政。现在才对人民建立了民主，对反革命建立了强硬的专政。这不是向后退，不是恢复旧的错误，而是在纠正错误的道路上向前迈了一大步。
    关于党的组织问题，科洛伊说，匈牙利社会主义工人党将是在组织上、政治上和思想上统一的、坚定的党。应当考虑到已经参加党的这些党员是在最艰难的日子里和最需要勇气的时候参加到党内来的。今后，我们党内、国内将有很多变化，但是有一点是肯定的，就是党将永远是领导力量。
    党和政府认为大部分知识分子不是反革命，而是正直的爱国者。现已有很多知识分子参与了政府纲领的制定工作。
    关于知识分子的状况，他说，虽然在知识分子中有过，而且现在还有些混乱，但是党和政府仍旧认为知识分子中的大部分不是反革命分子，而是正直的爱国者。
    我们所需要的知识分子是掌握马克思列宁主义的实质和精神，并且能把它运用到匈牙利具体实际中去的知识分子。
    现在已经有很多知识分子参与了政府纲领的制定工作。我们的计划是，在各个部门中组织各种吸收知识分子参加的专门委员会。
