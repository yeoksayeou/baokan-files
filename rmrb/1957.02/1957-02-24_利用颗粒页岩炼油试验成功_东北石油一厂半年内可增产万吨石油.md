The Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 1 has successfully completed a granulated shale retorting experiment, which maximizes the utilization of oil shale and creates conditions for increasing oil production. This year, 15% to 20% of the factory's retorting equipment, which would have been shut down due to insufficient raw materials, can now be fully operational. It is estimated that 10,000 tons of synthetic petroleum can be produced within six months.

The use of granulated shale to produce petroleum is a major advancement in the production technology of China's synthetic petroleum industry. In the past, the retorting furnaces designed by Japanese invaders could only use shale larger than 20 mm for oil extraction, and all crushed shale pieces smaller than 20 mm were discarded. In order to use these crushed shale pieces for oil extraction, the Japanese invaders conducted research and experiments for eight years without achieving industrialized production. After liberation, the engineering and technical personnel and workers of Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 1, with the help of Soviet experts, overcame various obstacles in less than a year and a half to utilize all small shale pieces ranging from 8 mm to 20 mm, increasing the utilization rate of oil shale from 60% to 65% to 75% to 80%. However, the factory still had to discard about two million tons of powdered shale smaller than 8 mm each year.

Last year, the factory's engineering and technical personnel continued to work hard to find ways to maximize the utilization of oil shale resources. They first used the discarded powdered shale to extract oil through heap retorting. Immediately afterwards, they began experimenting with using existing retorting furnaces to retort granulated shale of 4 mm to 8 mm and briquetting shale powder smaller than 4 mm for retorting. Granulated shale has a high density and few pores. How to overcome resistance in the retorting furnace to achieve normal production was the key problem facing more than 100 experimenters at the beginning of the experiment. In order to solve this key problem, the engineering and technical personnel carefully analyzed the properties and composition of the shale and repeatedly studied how to modify the furnace equipment. The oil refining workers stayed by the retorting furnace, recording the changes in the fire layer at every moment, and painstakingly explored the corresponding operating methods. After five months of repeated experiments, they achieved good results. The experiment proved that as long as the existing retorting furnace equipment is slightly modified, it is not only possible to extract oil from granulated shale, but also the oil extraction rate is only slightly lower than that of large shale pieces. On average, 28 tons of granulated shale can produce one ton of oil. In this way, granulated shale of 4 mm to 8 mm can be fully utilized, and 60% of the shale powder, which has always been discarded as waste, can be recovered as raw material for production. At present, the briquetting retorting experiment of shale powder smaller than 4 mm has also made great progress. Soon, after this experiment is successful, the valuable raw material for synthetic petroleum - oil shale - can be 100% utilized.

### 利用颗粒页岩炼油试验成功  东北石油一厂半年内可增产万吨石油

    利用颗粒页岩炼油试验成功
    东北石油一厂半年内可增产万吨石油
    本报讯　一项最大限度地利用油母页岩、为增产石油创造条件的颗粒页岩干馏试验，已经在东北石油一厂获得成功。今年工厂由于原料不足要停止运转的15％到20％的干馏炉设备，仍然可以全部开动，预计半年内就可以增产一万吨人造石油。
    利用颗粒页岩生产石油，是我国人造石油工业生产技术上的一大进步。过去，日本侵略者设计的干馏炉只能用二十公厘以上的页岩炼油，小于二十公厘的碎页岩块总是全部被扔掉。为了利用这些碎页岩块炼油，日本侵略者曾经研究试验了八年，也没有达到工业化生产的地步。解放后，东北石油一厂的工程技术人员和职工，在苏联专家帮助下不到一年半的时间就突破各种障碍，把八公厘到二十公厘的小块页岩全部利用起来，使油母页岩的利用率由过去的60％到65％提高到75％到80％。但是，全厂每年仍然要扔掉不足八公厘的粉末页岩二百万吨左右。
    去年，厂内工程技术人员继续努力寻找最大限度地利用油母页岩这项资源的办法。他们首先利用被扔弃的粉末页岩进行成堆干馏炼出了油。紧接着他们就开始试验利用现有干馏炉干馏四公厘到八公厘的颗粒页岩和把四公厘以下的页岩粉末压锭进行干馏。颗粒页岩密度大，空隙少，在干馏炉里如何克服阻力，达到正常生产，这是试验开始时摆在一百多名试验者面前的关键问题。为了解决这个关键问题，工程技术人员仔细分析了页岩的性质和组成，反复研究了如何改装炉内设备；炼油工人守在干馏炉旁记录着每一时刻的火层变化，苦心摸索着相适应的操作方法。经过五个月的反复试验，他们获得了良好的结果。试验证明：只要把现有干馏炉设备稍加改装，从颗粒页岩中炼取石油不仅可能，而且炼油率只略低于大块页岩，平均二十八吨颗粒页岩就能出一吨油。这样，四公厘到八公厘的颗粒页岩可以全部加以利用，一向被当作废物抛弃的粉末页岩，就有60％可以收回作为生产原料。目前，四公厘以下的页岩粉末的压锭干馏试验，也有了很大的进展。不久，这个试验成功以后，就可以把宝贵的人造石油原料——油母页岩百分之百地利用起来。
