    Peasants on Four Million Mu of Low-lying Land in Tianjin Special District
    Formerly Wandering and Begging in Poverty
    Now Enjoying Abundant Harvests with Several Times the Grain Output

    (Our Newspaper News) Our newspaper reporter He Li reports: In 1956, Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, implemented the transformation of low-lying areas on the basis of advanced cooperativization throughout the district, achieving great success and transforming an area that had suffered from severe flooding and poverty into a rich land of fish and rice. The counties in Tianjin Special District are located downstream of the Haihe River system, and the terrain is particularly low-lying. Low-lying marshes and wetlands account for 69% of the total land in the special district, approximately nine million mu. Among these, approximately three to four million mu are marshes and lakes that are flooded year-round. Other areas that are not flooded year-round are frequently washed by floods, making people's lives very difficult. According to investigations in Dazhongzhuang in Baodi County and Tuanbowa in Jinghai County, ordinary farmers used to subsist on bran and vegetable gruel. 90% of the labor force was forced to go out to earn a living, and 30% of the families wandered and begged everywhere. After liberation, although the People's Government often provided relief, it could not solve the fundamental difficulties in people's lives. In 1955, during the development of elementary cooperatives, the local Party and government leading organs had already used state aid and the advantages of cooperatives to begin transforming low-lying areas, achieving considerable success. In 1956, advanced cooperativization was realized throughout the special district. Due to the concentration of land, manpower, and financial resources, it was easier to make unified plans. The Tianjin Special District leading organs then further carried out large-scale transformation.

    The characteristic of low-lying areas is that there are floods every year, generally with spring droughts and autumn floods. The special district adopted a unified arrangement for flood prevention, water storage, irrigation, and drainage. In low-lying marshes and lakes with sufficient water sources and drainage outlets, formal irrigation and drainage projects were built. In steep terrain with large low-lying areas that are flooded year-round, methods such as "abandoning the low for the high" and "dividing and governing" were implemented. Water retaining embankments were built along the boundary of the accumulated water in the center of the low-lying area, and the embankments were connected to drainage ditches to ensure that the land outside the embankments would not be flooded by the overflowing water from the low-lying area. In addition, the dikes of various rivers were strengthened to enhance flood resistance. In total, the special district used nearly ten million workdays to transform low-lying areas in 1956, completing 25 million cubic meters of earthwork, building terraced fields and ridges on two million mu of land, and building more than 900 sluice gates, culverts, and electric pumping stations, transforming 4.2 million mu of low-lying land, accounting for more than 45% of the total low-lying land.

    On the basis of transforming the low-lying areas, the crop planting system was also reformed. Early-maturing summer crops such as barley, wheat, potatoes, and peas were promoted in flood-prone areas. In areas that may accumulate water in the autumn, crops such as marsh rice, paddy rice, and dry rice were planted according to the depth of the water. Due to these measures, the low-lying areas achieved huge bumper harvests last year despite unprecedented floods. In total, the special district replanted 4.44 million mu with early-maturing and water-resistant crops last year, including 360,000 mu of paddy rice, 3.5 times more than in 1955; 1.42 million mu of marsh rice and dry rice, 3.7 times more than in 1955; and 150,000 mu of potatoes, 1.4 times more than the previous year. Together with other crops, the low-lying areas harvested a total of 667 million jin of grain, three to four times more than in ordinary years.

    Coupled with abundant fisheries and aquatic products, the lives of people in the low-lying areas have been greatly improved. Many commune members said, "This year I tasted the sweetness of the advanced cooperative. Without establishing a cooperative, there is no way to transform the low-lying areas and improve our lives."

    The Tianjin Prefectural Committee has decided to comprehensively manage floods this year, continue to implement crop replanting according to local conditions, and strive to basically complete the transformation of low-lying areas in the entire special district within two or three years.

    天津专区四百万亩洼地上的农民
    过去到处流离乞讨贫困不堪
    现在粮食增产几倍其乐融融
    本报讯　本报记者贺笠报道：河北省天津专区1956年在全区高级合作化的基础上实行洼地改造，获得巨大成就，使过去历遭严重水患贫困不堪的地区，一跃而为富饶的鱼米之乡。天津专区各县地居海河水系下游，地势特别低洼。全专区的土地，洼淀占去69％，约九百万亩。其中常年积水的淀泊约三、四百万亩，其他非常年积水的地区，历年常被洪水洗涮，人民生活非常痛苦。据宝坻县大中庄和静海县团泊洼调查，过去一般农民都依糠菜糊口，有90％的劳动力被迫外出谋生，有30％的人家到处流离乞讨。解放以后，人民政府虽常有救济，但并不能解决人民生活的根本困难。1955年在初级合作社发展的时期，当地党政领导机关已利用了国家的援助和合作社的优越性开始改造洼地，取得不少成绩。1956年全专区都实现了高级合作化，由于土地、人力、财力的集中，更便于统一筹划，天津专区领导机关即进一步进行大规模的改造。
    洼地的特点是年年都有水灾，一般春旱秋涝。该专区便采取了防涝、蓄水、灌溉、排水统一安排的办法。在水源充足又有排水出路的洼淀，兴修了正规的灌溉排水工程；地势陡斜在长年积水的大洼，实行“舍低就高”、“分割治理”等法，沿着洼心的积水界线筑成围水埝，并使围埝与排水沟相连，保证围水埝以外的土地不致因洼内的积水外溢而被淹没。另外并加固各河堤防，增强抗洪能力。总计1956年全专区为改造洼地共用了将近一千万个工作日，完成土方工程二千五百万公方，修筑了二百万亩土地的土埂畦田和九百多座闸涵、电力扬水站，改造洼地四百二十万亩，占全部洼地数的45％强。
    在改造洼地的基础上，又改革作物种植制度，在易涝地区都推广夏收早熟作物，如大麦、小麦、马铃薯、豌豆等。在秋季可能积水的地区，则根据水的深浅种植淀稻、水稻、陆稻等。由于这些措施，去年的洼地在空前洪水的情况下获得了巨额丰收。总计全专区去年共改种早熟、耐水作物四百四十四万亩，其中水稻三十六万亩，比1955年多三点五倍；淀稻、陆稻一百四十二万亩，比1955年多三点七倍；马铃薯十五万亩，比前年多一点四倍。连同其他作物，各洼共收粮食六亿六千七百万斤，比过去一般年成多收三至四倍。
    连同丰富的渔业水产，现在洼内人民生活已大为改善，不少社员说，今年我尝到高级社的滋味了，不成立合作社就不用想改造洼地，改善生活。
    天津地委已决定今年全面治理水患，继续因地制宜的实行作物改种，争取在两三年内基本完成全专区的洼地改造。
