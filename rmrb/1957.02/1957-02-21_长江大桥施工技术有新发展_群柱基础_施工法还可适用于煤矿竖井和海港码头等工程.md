A reporter for this newspaper, Cao Baoming, reports: New technological developments have been achieved in the scientific research conducted by Soviet experts and Chinese engineering personnel, in combination with on-site construction, for the construction techniques used for the Yangtze River Bridge foundation. This was stated to the reporter by the technical负责人 (person in charge) of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau.

It has now been preliminarily proven that this new technology is not only suitable for the geological conditions of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, but can also be used to build bridge foundations under any geological conditions. At the same time, it can also be used to build coal mine shafts, large water collection wells, seaport docks, etc., and will become a new construction method that can be widely used. This will enable many projects to achieve construction safety, low cost, and a very short construction period, while also implementing factory-style construction.

The "group pile foundation" construction method using sunk 1.55-meter diameter pipe piles, as used on the Wuhan Yangtze River, has proven through practice that using this method to build the underwater foundations for the eight piers of a double-layer bridge like the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge requires only one year (i.e., one dry season) in addition to preparatory work. Completing the pier body takes another year and a half, and the entire bridge can be completed in two years, which is much faster than older construction methods. Similar experience has been gained in the construction of the Minjiang Bridge and at the three locations of Guishan, Tianxingzhou, and Fengtai, which shows that this method can be universally used to build bridge foundations under any geological conditions.

Initially, when this method was used on the Wuhan Yangtze River, old calculation standards were adopted because the scientific research had not yet produced calculation standards for the new structure resulting from this new technology. However, recent tests have proven that the bearing capacity of each pipe pile is three to four times greater than originally estimated. When building such bridges in the future, each pier can use one-third to two-thirds fewer pipe piles, saving even more investment. They are continuing to study the calculation standards and formulas for the new structure resulting from this new technology, as well as the quotas for machinery, electricity consumption, and labor used in construction.

The second problem they are researching is the prefabricated reinforced concrete "open caisson" sunk by vibration, which has been developed from this method. An "open caisson" is a hollow pipe with a larger diameter. Previously, open caissons used were thick-walled, relying entirely on the weight of the caisson itself to sink. In the past, the largest open caissons used in our country were four to six meters in diameter, and it took three to six months to sink them twenty to twenty-five meters. Now, a thin-walled open caisson has been created, using a vibratory pile driver to force it to sink, which only takes a month. In this experiment, they manufactured pile drivers with a vibration force of 140 tons. These vibratory pile drivers can also be combined into a group to drive, and the multiple of the vibration force is correspondingly increased. When sinking an open caisson with a diameter of three meters, they only vibrated for fourteen minutes in sandy soil to sink it twenty-three meters, and only vibrated for two to three hours in clay, gravel-sand layers to sink it twenty meters. This method has been proven to be used to build ventilation shafts for coal mines, and it can also be used to replace smaller diameter pipe piles to build bridges, reducing the number of pipe piles required. This year, it has been decided to use this type of open caisson to build the foundation of the double-track railway bridge over the Zhang River in Henan. Each pier will only use two open caissons with a diameter of 3.6 meters (i.e., one caisson will bear one railway line), which greatly simplifies construction. They also plan to continue testing near Hanyang Railway Station in March to further study how to smoothly remove the dense clay in the caisson and make this method suitable for building coal mining shafts with very strict specifications.

The third problem they are researching is using spun pipe piles as "pile caps." This method has been successfully used on the Hanshui Bridge, Fenghua Bridge, and Yuyao Bridge. Currently, they are studying how to increase the bearing capacity of each pile and develop calculation formulas and quotas.

The comrade finally said: "After these three methods are successfully tested, the old methods in foundation construction, such as pneumatic caissons, thick-walled open caissons, etc., can be completely discarded."

Based on the research results, they have already compiled a set of construction regulations, and it is expected that this scientific research work will be fully concluded by the end of this year.

### 长江大桥施工技术有新发展  “群柱基础”施工法还可适用于煤矿竖井和海港码头等工程

    长江大桥施工技术有新发展
    “群柱基础”施工法还可适用于煤矿竖井和海港码头等工程
    本报记者曹葆铭报道　修建长江大桥基础所用的新技术，在苏联专家和我国工程人员结合现场施工进行的科学研究中，又有了新的发展和成就。这是武汉长江大桥工程局的技术负责人对记者说的。
    现在初步证明：这种新技术不仅适用于武汉长江大桥的地质条件，并且能在任何地质条件下修建桥梁基础，同时还能用来修建煤矿竖井、大汇水井和海港码头等等，将成为一种能广泛使用的新施工方法。这样就使许多工程能作到施工安全、造价低廉、工期很短，而又实行工厂化施工。
    在武汉长江上所用的下沉直径一点五五公尺管柱的“群柱基础”的施工方法，经过实践，证明用这种方法修建武汉长江大桥这样的八个墩子的双层桥梁，除准备工作外，只需一年（即一个枯水季节）就能修成水下基础，一年半修完墩身，两年修成全桥，比旧的施工方法快的多。岷江大桥施工和龟山、天星洲和丰台三处也有同样的经验，这说明了这个方法可以普遍地用来在任何地质条件下修建桥梁基础。
    最初在武汉长江上使用这个方法时，因为科学研究方面还未提出过由于这种新技术而产生的新结构的计算标准，所以采用了旧计算标准，而最近试验证明，每根管柱的承载力比原来预计的要大三、四倍。将来再建这样的大桥时，每个桥墩就可少用三分之一至三分之二的管柱，节约更多的投资。他们还在继续研究由这个新技术而产生的新结构的计算标准和计算公式，以及施工所用的机具、用电和劳动力定额。
    他们研究的第二个问题，是由这个方法发展起来的用震动方法下沉的装配式钢筋混凝土“开口沉井”。“开口沉井”即是直径更大的空心管子，以前，所用的开口沉井都是厚壁的，全靠沉井本身重量下沉。我国过去所用的开口沉井最大为四公尺至六公尺直径，每下沉二十至二十五公尺，得三个月至半年，现在创造出一种薄壁的开口沉井，用震动打桩机强迫下沉，只要一个月就行。在这个试验中，他们制造出了具有一百四十吨震动力的打桩机，这些震动打桩机还能组成一组机群来打，其震动力的倍数也相应提高。在下沉直径三公尺的开口沉井时，他们在砂土中只震动了十四分钟就下沉了二十三公尺，在粘土层、卵石夹砂层中也只震动二、三小时就下沉二十公尺。这个方法已经试验证明，可以用来修建煤矿的通风竖井，也可用来代替直径较小的管柱修建桥梁，减少下管柱的数量。今年要修建河南漳河的双轨铁路桥，决定用这种开口沉井来修桥墩基础，每个桥墩只用两个三点六公尺直径的开口沉井（即一个沉井就承载一条铁路），其施工就简便多了。他们还计划3月份在汉阳车站附近继续试验，进一步研究怎样顺利地取出沉井中的密实的粘土，并使这个方法能用来修建规格很严的取煤竖井。
    他们研究的第三个问题是用旋制的管桩来作“桩承台”。这个方法已在汉水桥、奉化桥和余姚桥使用成功，现时在研究如何提高每根桩的承载能力，并作出计算公式和定额。
    这位同志最后说：“这三种方法试验成功后，就能完全摒弃基础施工中的旧方法，如压气沉箱、厚壁开口沉井等等。
    根据研究结果，他们已经编出了一套施工规程，预计这项科学研究工作到今年年底可以全部作出结论。
