    Shanxi Province Agricultural Cooperative's Experience in Planned Production and Labor Management
    Wang Xiujin, Bai Xinghua
    Production Plan
    In 1956, all cooperatives in Shanxi Province, in accordance with the spirit of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)," formulated annual production plans, and one-third of the cooperatives formulated twelve-year long-range development plans, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of cooperative members in building a new socialist countryside, and rapidly setting off a province-wide upsurge in agricultural production.
    Large-scale collective economies must have comprehensive production plans to guide production; they must also conscientiously implement planned management in order to put the development of production on a normal track; otherwise, it will cause confusion in production, and even cause losses in production. In the past year, many cooperatives, due to formulating advanced and reliable production plans based on their own actual needs and conditions, and implementing them well, successfully completed the plans, which not only ensured increased grain and cotton production, but also made multiple economies develop in an all-round way, and the living requirements of cooperative members were generally met. However, in the past year, many cooperatives also had blindly progressive tendencies in formulating production plans, so some cooperatives, although greatly increased production compared to 1955, still failed to reach the planned targets, and the plans became "empty talk," hurting the enthusiasm of cooperative members. Some cooperatives set the plans too low, failing to mobilize the enthusiasm of cooperative members. Some cooperatives did not conduct comprehensive planning for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and sideline production, resulting in the phenomenon of grasping the east and losing the west, and attending to one thing and losing sight of another in the production process. Some cooperatives, because they did not plant according to the needs of reasonable crop rotation, not only affected the increase in production that year, but also created difficulties for future rotation and stable increases in yield.
    In order to learn from the experience and lessons of the past year and do a good job in planning management, first of all, when each cooperative formulates a production plan, it must conduct investigations and research on the soil conditions, climate conditions, historical operating conditions of each piece of land, and the needs of reasonable crop rotation of various crops in the cooperative, and at the same time, it is necessary to grasp one's own investment strength and labor force conditions, so that the production plan is placed on a reliable basis. Second, it is necessary to implement the policy of increasing grain and cotton production as the main task, while actively developing animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations and other productions, comprehensively and rationally planning the proportion of agricultural, animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations and other production developments, and rationally planning the current year's production and farmland capital construction work such as water conservancy and soil and water conservation. Reasonable allocation should be made in the utilization of land, labor and investment. Only in this way can various productions develop in proportion and promote each other. According to the current situation in the province, in general areas, the income from animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline production of each cooperative should account for at least about 20% of the total income for the year. In areas with better conditions for developing diversified economies, the income from diversified economies should generally account for about 50% of the total income. When planning the development of various economies of the whole cooperative, appropriate planning should also be made for the production of cooperative members' household sideline occupations. Generally, it is required that the total income of cooperative members' personal household sideline occupations should account for 5% to 10% of the total income of the cooperative. Third, for the planting of various crops, a rotation plan should be carried out. Each cooperative should conduct investigation and research on its own soil conditions and how to rotate crops, and combine the requirements of the state plan and the needs of cooperative members' lives with the conditions of the cooperative to rationally arrange the planting ratio of various crops. Fourth, cooperatives must carry out production under the guidance of the state economic plan, but the state should not exercise excessive control over the production plans of cooperatives, but should give play to the independence and initiative of cooperative production and management. The state only controls the planting area and output targets of several major crops related to the national economy and the people's livelihood (cotton, wheat, oil crops, hemp skins, and tobacco leaves), and only stipulates the output per unit area for other crops, without controlling the planting area. The state should also give cooperatives a certain degree of flexibility in the planting area of the several major crops controlled by the state. Fifth, each cooperative should find out the law of increasing production for each piece of land based on the historical management foundation and yield level of each piece of land, and then tap the potential for increasing production, study practical and feasible measures, and stipulate a correct target for increasing production. According to the experience of the past few years, the speed of production development in cooperatives should generally be around 10% per year.
    The process of formulating a plan is also a process of mobilizing the masses. The experience of 1956 tells us that production plans formulated through democratic discussions by cooperative members are more advanced and reliable. Cooperative members are also active and hardworking in implementing the plans; plans formulated by a few cadres without mobilizing cooperative members for discussion are either conservative or blindly progressive, and cooperative members adopt a passive attitude towards implementing the plans.
    Labor Management
    After the establishment of advanced forms of cooperatives, the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers soared unprecedentedly. The attendance rate of male laborers in the province reached more than 90%, an increase of about 10% compared with before the cooperation. The attendance rate of female laborers reached about 80%, an increase of 30% to 40% compared with before cooperation. The number of working days per male laborer reached about 250, an increase of about 25% compared with before cooperation. The average number of working days per female laborer reached about 120, an increase of nearly double compared with before cooperation. However, due to the lack of experience in labor management, there was initially a tendency for chaotic labor order and only looking at quantity regardless of quality.
    In order to establish a normal production order and overcome the chaotic state, various cooperatives have attached importance to continuously rectifying and improving the work of labor organization. Over the past year, the experience in labor organization has been: it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the field production team. The scale of the field production team should not be too large. If it is too large, it is not easy to lead; if it is too small, it cannot give play to the advantages of collective labor. Therefore, it is generally appropriate to have 30 to 40 households in the plains area and 20 to 30 households in the mountain area. In order to strengthen the responsibility system in production, the labor force, the cultivated land, the used farming livestock and farm implements of the field production team should be fixed. In particular, the labor force and the land should be fixed for several years according to the crop rotation plan. The production groups under the production team have adopted two forms: the first is that the labor force and the cultivated land of the group are basically fixed, and they are cultivated on the fixed land at ordinary times. When necessary, the production captain can adjust the labor force between the groups. The second is to organize temporary production groups according to the needs of production in the several production seasons of spring plowing and sowing, summer harvesting and planting, autumn harvesting and plowing, and winter. Both of these methods can be promoted. Some cooperatives fix the land for each person or each household to contract for cultivation, which has more shortcomings, and it is not advisable to promote it. In addition, when the small village in some joint village cooperatives is not enough to establish a production team, it is also possible to establish a fixed production group that basically performs the functions of a production team. As for forestry, animal husbandry, various sideline occupations, and farmland capital construction work, professional production teams or groups can also be established according to production needs.
    In order to implement the piece-rate wage system, two main tasks have been grasped in various places: the first is to universally formulate labor quotas and continuously revise quotas. Over the past year, 80% of the cooperatives in the province have formulated quotas. According to the experience of one year, cooperatives must strive to formulate quotas for the vast majority of agricultural work, and in particular, the quality standards of the quotas must be clearly and specifically stipulated. The second is to overcome the tendency of egalitarianism in labor remuneration and formulate and continuously revise the standards of labor remuneration. Egalitarianism is mainly manifested in too few grades of agricultural work and too small a difference in labor remuneration. However, since agriculture is still manual cultivation, the level of technology is not much different, the grades cannot be too many, and the difference in remuneration cannot be too large. According to the experience of many cooperatives, the grading of agricultural work is generally better to be divided into nine to eleven grades in grain crop areas; in economic crop areas, it is generally better to be divided into seven to nine grades. The grade difference in labor remuneration is generally appropriate to be one point per grade, five thousandths of a point per grade below the middle grade, and one working day difference between the highest grade agricultural work and the lowest grade agricultural work.
    On the basis of quota management, an excess reward system should be implemented. Without implementing overproduction rewards, backward production teams do not pay attention to technology, the quality of labor is low, working days are wasted, and production is reduced. On the contrary, they receive higher incomes due to increased labor input, which is extremely unreasonable and does not conform to the principle of distribution according to work. In order to overcome this unreasonable phenomenon, 60% of the cooperatives in the province have implemented an overproduction reward system. That is, if the production team completes the production plan in excess, the production team will be rewarded with a certain percentage of the excess. A small number of cooperatives have adopted more reasonable methods: one is to add or deduct working days according to the production plan that the production team should complete; one is to add or deduct working days to the production team according to the proportion of the average completion of the production plan of the whole cooperative; and the other is to add or deduct working days according to the actual value of each working day for each crop. The latter three methods are better able to reflect the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work.

    山西省农业社计划生产和劳动管理的经验

    生产计划
    1956年，山西省所有的合作社都根据“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”的精神，制定了年度的生产计划，并且有三分之一的社制定了发展生产的十二年远景规划，大大鼓舞了社员群众的建设社会主义新农村的积极性，迅速地掀起了全省的农业生产高潮。
    大规模的集体经济，必须有全面的生产规划来指导生产；还必须认真地实行计划管理，才能够使生产的发展走上正常的轨道；否则，就会造成生产中的混乱状况，甚至会造成生产上的损失。一年来，许多合作社由于根据自己的实际需要和条件，制定了先进可靠的生产计划，而且执行得很好，计划胜利地完成了，既保证了粮棉增产，又使多种经济全面地发展起来，社员的生活要求也一般地满足了。但是，过去一年中，也有不少的合作社，制定生产计划有盲目冒进的偏向，因此有些社虽然比1955年大大增产了，但是仍然达不到计划指标，计划成了“放空炮”，伤害了社员的积极性。也有些合作社把计划定得太低了，没有能够把社员的积极性调动起来。有些合作社对于农业、林业、畜牧业和副业生产没有进行全面规划，因而在生产过程中就产生了抓东丢西、顾此失彼的现象。有些合作社因为没有根据各种作物合理轮作的需要进行种植，不但影响了当年的增产，而且还给今后的轮作和产量的稳定上升造成了困难。
    为了吸取过去一年的经验教训，做好计划管理工作，首先，每个合作社在制定生产计划的时候，必须对本社的土壤条件、气候条件、每块土地的历史的经营状况和各种作物合理轮作的需要等进行调查研究，同时，要掌握自己的投资力量和劳动力的条件，使生产计划放在可靠的基础上。第二、要贯彻执行以增产粮棉为主，同时积极地发展畜牧业、林业、副业等各种生产的方针，全面地合理地规划农业、畜牧业、林业、副业等各种生产发展的比例，合理地规划当年的生产和水利、水土保持等农田基本建设工作。对于土地、劳动力和投资的利用方面要进行合理的分配。这样才能够使各种生产有比例地互相促进发展。根据目前全省的情况看，在一般地区每个合作社的畜牧业、林业、副业生产的收入至少应该占到全年全部收入的20％左右，在发展多种经济的条件较好的地区，多种经济的收入一般应该占到全部收入的50％左右。在规划全社的多种经济的发展的时候，对于社员家庭副业的生产也应当有适当的规划。一般地要求全社社员个人家庭副业收入的总和应当占到全社全部收入的5％到10％。第三、对于各种作物的种植，应该进行轮作规划。每个合作社对自己的土壤条件以及如何倒茬，都应当进行调查研究，把国家计划的要求、社员生活的需要同本社的条件结合起来，合理安排各种作物的种植比例。第四、合作社必须在国家经济计划指导下进行生产，但国家对合作社的生产计划不应当控制过严，而应当发挥合作社生产经营的独立性和主动性。国家只控制几种关系国计民生的主要作物
  （棉花、小麦、油料、麻皮、烟叶）的种植面积和产量指标，其他作物只规定单位面积产量，不控制播种面积。国家所控制的几种主要作物的种植面积，也应当给合作社一定的机动权。第五、每个合作社应当根据自己的每块土地的历史的经营基础和产量水平，找出每块土地的增产规律，然后挖掘增产潜力，研究切实可行的措施，规定出一个正确的增产指标。根据几年来的经验，合作社的生产发展的速度，一般地以每年增产10％左右为宜。
    制定计划的过程也是一个发动群众的过程。1956年的经验告诉我们，凡是经过社员民主讨论所制定的生产计划，就比较先进可靠。社员对实行计划也积极努力；凡是由几个干部包办而不发动社员讨论所制定的计划，不是保守就是冒进，社员对实行计划也抱着一种消极态度。
    劳动管理
    当高级形式的合作社建立起来以后，广大农民的劳动积极性空前高涨。全省男劳动力的出勤人数达到90％以上，比合作化以前提高了10％左右。女劳动力的出勤人数达到80％左右，比合作化以前提高了30％到40％。每个男劳动力的出勤日数达到二百五十个工作日左右，比合作化以前增加了25％左右。每个出勤的女劳动力的出勤日数平均达到一百二十个工作日左右，比合作化以前增加将近一倍。但由于大家对劳动管理都还缺乏经验，最初也曾发生了劳动秩序混乱和干活只看数量不顾质量的偏向。
    为了建立正常的生产秩序，克服混乱状态，各个合作社都重视了不断地整顿和改善劳动组织的工作。一年来，在劳动组织方面的经验是：必须加强田间生产队的领导。田间生产队的规模不宜太大。太大了不便于领导；太小了不能够发挥集体劳动的优越性。因此，平川地区一般以三十户到四十户为宜，山地区一般以二十户到三十户为宜。为了加强生产上的责任制，田间生产队的劳动力、所耕作的土地、所使用的耕畜和农具，都应当固定下来。特别是劳动力和土地，应当根据作物的轮作规划，固定几年不变。生产队下面的生产小组，采取了两种形式：第一种是小组的劳动力和所耕作的土地基本固定，平时在固定的土地上耕作，必要时可以由生产队长在组与组之间调剂劳动力。第二种是在春耕播种、夏收夏种、秋收秋耕和冬季这几个生产季节，按照生产的需要，组织临时性的生产小组。这两种办法都是可以推行的。有些合作社按人或者按户固定土地包干耕作的方法，缺点比较多，以不推广为好。此外，在有些联村社的小村不够成立一个生产队的时候，成立固定的生产小组，基本上履行生产队的职能也是可以的。至于林业、畜牧业、各种副业以及农田基本建设工作，也可以按照生产需要建立专业性的生产队或者组。
    为了贯彻实行按件计酬制，各地抓了两件主要工作：第一件是普遍制定劳动定额和不断地修订定额。一年来全省有80％的合作社制定了定额。根据一年的经验，合作社必须力求绝大部分的农活都制定出定额来，并且特别要把定额的质量标准规定得明确具体。第二件是克服劳动报酬上的平均主义的偏向，制定和不断地修订劳动报酬的标准。平均主义主要表现在农活分等太少和劳动报酬的级差太小上。但是由于目前农业还是手工耕作，技术高低相差不多，分等也不能太多，报酬的级差也不能太大。根据许多合作社的经验，农活的分等，在粮食作物区，一般以分为九级至十一级为好；在经济作物区，一般以分为七级至九级为好。劳动报酬的级差，一般以每级相差一分为宜，中间级以下的每级以差五厘为宜，最高一级农活和最低一级农活以相差一个劳动日为宜。
    在定额管理的基础上，要实行超额奖励制。不实行超产奖励，落后的生产队不讲究技术，劳动质量低，浪费了劳动日，减了产，反而由于增加用工得到了较高的收入，这是极不合理的，不符合按劳取酬的原则。为了克服这种不合理的现象，全省有60％的合作社实行了超产奖励制。即生产队超额完成生产计划的，从超额部分中给生产队以一定比例的奖励。还有少数的合作社采取了比较更合理的办法：一种是按照生产队应当完成的生产计划，加记或者扣减劳动日；一种是按照全社平均完成生产计划的比例，给生产队加记或者扣减劳动日；再一种是按照每种作物每个劳动日的实际价值，加记或扣减劳动日。后面这三种办法是比较更能体现按劳取酬、多劳多得的原则的。
