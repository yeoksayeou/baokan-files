Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 25th: The Northeast Institute of Technology, where young teachers constitute the vast majority, is employing various methods to improve the quality of its faculty.

This institute of technology, newly established after liberation, initially encountered the difficulty of low faculty quality. The ratio of old to new teachers in the college is about one to ten. The new teachers are of lower standard and lack experience. Even the old teachers need to improve their professional skills. By adopting the method of internal and external training to improve the level of faculty, the new teachers have grown up rapidly. Last semester, a total of 327 people taught courses, of which 162 were teaching assistants, and 70 of the teaching assistants were teaching for the first time.

The work of internal faculty training is carried out through conducting scientific research and teaching method research, organizing special lectures, basic course learning, and foreign language learning; Soviet experts working at the college also participated in this work. After studying, most of the teachers in the college can now read Russian reference books. External training mainly involves sending teachers to relevant universities, scientific research institutions, and production departments for study, investigation, research, and experimentation, so as to open new courses or new specialties. At present, the college has sent more than 60 teachers for external training. Courses such as "Automatic Control," "Hydrogeology," and "Enterprise Economic Organization and Planning" were newly opened after teachers returned from external training. In recent years, the college has also selected dozens of teachers to study abroad. Zheng Huanwen, who went abroad for further study in 1950, has now returned to the Department of Mechanical Engineering to teach. He obtained a PhD in the Soviet Union.

    东北工学院运用多种方法培养师资
    新教师教学能力迅速提高
    新华社沈阳25日电　青年教师占绝大多数的东北工学院正运用多种方法提高师资质量。
    这个在解放后新开办的工学院，一开始就遇到师资质量不高的困难。这个学院老教师很少，新老教师的比例约为十比一，新教师水平不高，缺乏经验，老教师的业务也需要提高。由于学院采用校内、校外培养的办法提高师资水平，新教师很快地成长起来。上学期共有三百二十七人开课，其中助教占一百六十二人，助教中有七十人是第一次开课的。
    在院内培养师资的工作是通过开展科学研究和教学法研究、组织专题讲座、基础课学习和外语学习等办法进行的；在学院工作的苏联专家也参与了这一工作。经过学习，目前这个学院绝大部分教师都能阅读俄文参考书。在院外培养主要是选派教师到有关的高等学校、科学研究机构和生产部门去学习、调查、研究、实验，以便开出新课或新专业。目前这个学院送到校外培养的师资有六十多人。“自动控制”、“水文地质”、“企业经济组织与计划”等课都是送到校外培养的教师回来后新开的。几年来，学院还选拔了数十名教师出国深造。1950年出国深造的郑焕文现已回到机械系任教，他在苏联获得了副博士学位。
