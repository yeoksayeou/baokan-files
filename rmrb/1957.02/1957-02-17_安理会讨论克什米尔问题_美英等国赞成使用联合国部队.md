Xinhua News Agency, February 16th, New York Dispatch: The Security Council met on the morning of the 15th to continue discussing the Kashmir issue.

    The United States, Britain, Australia, and Cuba jointly submitted a proposal to the Security Council, advocating consideration of the Pakistani representative's suggestion to use a United Nations temporary force in Kashmir to achieve the demilitarization of the region. The proposal also suggested authorizing the President of the Security Council for February, Swedish representative Gunnar V. Jarring, to visit Pakistan and India to study with the governments of these two countries various proposals that might contribute to the realization of demilitarization in the aforementioned region, and tasking him to report the results of his visit to the Security Council no later than April 15, 1957.

    Indian representative Menon, in his speech at the afternoon meeting, strongly opposed the four-nation proposal. He said that the four-nation proposal was against India. India will never allow foreign troops to be stationed on its land, and this is an absolute and unconditional statement authorized by him. He also said that the four-nation proposal's emphasis on demilitarization distorts the situation in Kashmir. In his speech, Menon criticized Britain's position on this issue, saying that the British representative's actions would be detrimental to relations between the two countries.

    安理会讨论克什米尔问题
    美英等国赞成使用联合国部队
    据新华社16日讯　纽约消息：安全理事会15日上午开会，继续讨论克什米尔问题。
    美国、英国、澳大利亚和古巴四国向安理会提出一项提案，主张考虑巴基斯坦代表关于在克什米尔使用一支联合国临时部队，以实现这个地区的非军事化的建议。提案还建议授权2月份的安理会主席瑞典代表古纳尔·瓦·雅林前往巴基斯坦和印度访问，同这两国政府一同研究对在上述地区实现非军事化可能有所贡献的各种建议，并且责成他至迟在1957年4月15日以前向安理会报告访问结果。
    印度代表梅农在下午会议上发言强烈反对四国提案。他说，四国提案是反对印度的。印度绝不允许外国军队驻扎在它的土地上，这是他授权所作的一个绝对的、无条件的声明。他还说四国提案强调非军事化一点是对克什米尔局势的歪曲。梅农在发言中指责英国在这个问题上的立场，他说，英国代表的作法将会不利于两国之间的关系。
