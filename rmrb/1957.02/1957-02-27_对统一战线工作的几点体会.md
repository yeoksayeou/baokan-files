Some Experiences in United Front Work
Lin Zhicheng, Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association

I am an engineering and technical personnel who returned from studying abroad and have been engaged in the machinery manufacturing industry in Guangzhou for many years. Since liberation, thanks to the continuous cultivation and education of the Communist Party of China, I have had more opportunities to be tempered in study and work, constantly transform my thinking, and gradually improve my political and ideological level. Over the past seven years, I have deeply felt the meticulous care and love of the Party for intellectuals, and I have also deeply felt the greatness of the Party's united front policy. After studying the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, I would like to offer some opinions on the current united front work in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City. If there are any inaccuracies, please comrades, offer criticisms and corrections.

I. On the Issue of Fully发挥 the Potential Strength of China's Intellectuals

The solid alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals is an important guarantee for building socialism. In recent months, relevant departments, in order to implement the Party and the state's policy on intellectuals and further发挥 the potential strength of China's intellectuals, have been actively展开 recruitment work, absorbing more experts and senior intellectuals to serve the country's economic and cultural construction. This is an encouraging and exciting event.

However, in the work of employing intellectuals, there is still a tendency to demand too much, especially for those who are older or have some political and historical problems, many are still unwilling to employ them, and even if they are employed, they are often discriminated against in terms of political status and material treatment. This will undoubtedly increase the concerns and difficulties of intellectuals in finding employment. Let me cite two examples to illustrate: A cadre in Guangzhou was a university professor before liberation and collected relevant statistical data for the underground Communist Party organization through his students. After liberation, he worked in a municipal organ, but because he had previously served as a secretary to a certain pseudo-National Assembly representative, the leadership considered his history to be complicated and he was dismissed in 1953, causing extreme difficulties in his life. This year, after learning about this matter, I reported it to the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee of the CPC. After in-depth understanding by the Party organization, it was believed that the unit's handling was inappropriate, and he has been re-employed and given a more important position. Now, this cadre is working well in his post. Another example is an old expert in Guangzhou who has decades of experience in the paper industry. In the early days of liberation, he had disagreements with the military representative of the enterprise and was transferred back to the Provincial Department of Industry. After that, he was discriminated against by the leaders of the unit everywhere, causing him extreme mental pain. Recently, after the unit inspected the policy on intellectuals, he gained the trust of the organization and发挥 great enthusiasm in his work.

In carrying out united front work among intellectuals, we must not forget the characteristics of China's intellectuals. Intellectuals all come from the old society, and they all have some political and historical problems to varying degrees, which is very natural. Therefore, an incorrect attitude towards employing intellectuals will arouse their ideological concerns. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay full attention to this point.

II. On the Implementation of the Policy of United Front Work and Mutual Supervision

(1) United front work is a very complex and meticulous task. In order to do this work well, the leadership must be able to correctly grasp the principles and maintain regular contact with the masses. Some people criticize united front work as "uniting the upper but not the lower," which means that there are shortcomings in the past united front work, such as a narrow range of contacts and insufficient in-depth work. This should be improved. Secondly, it is hoped that the leadership will strengthen the inspection and ideological education of cadres, and correctly implement the spirit of the united front policy in specific work, so as to avoid causing adverse effects among the masses.

(2) To do a good job in united front work, the leadership must attach importance to the opinions of the masses, and promptly deal with the opinions or suggestions reflected by the masses, so as to ensure that there is an explanation and a solution. Correct opinions and positive and beneficial suggestions from the masses should, of course, be promptly adopted and implemented, and incorrect opinions or things that cannot be done should also be explained in a timely manner to educate the masses. In 1955, the Guangzhou Municipal Office of State Capitalism fully重视 this work and designated a cadre to be specifically responsible for contacting me. Therefore, many suggestions and opinions reflected by the business community could be quickly forwarded to relevant departments for timely handling. This approach is a good way of contacting and is very popular among the business community. I now suggest that the Eighth Office of Guangdong Province also do this, so that communication between the top and bottom can be smoother.

(3) Be good at listening carefully to different opinions. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "Allowing unrestricted debate on different viewpoints so as to reflect more comprehensively the various opinions of the masses inside and outside the Party, that is, to reflect more comprehensively the various aspects of the development process of objective things." This instruction is equally significant for united front work. If the leading cadres are only satisfied with the vulgar atmosphere of those who echo and agree at meetings or forums, and do not like to listen to different or even opposing opinions, this will greatly weaken our democratic life, damage the enthusiasm of the masses, and even cause deviations in work. Of course, the different or opposing opinions referred to here are not those who deliberately try to be different and confront the leadership in everything, let alone those who deliberately make trouble and attempt to harm the socialist cause, but constructive opinions that are well-founded, reasonable, and based on the interests of socialism. We must understand and grasp this boundary well.

In order to implement the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and other democratic parties, the democratic parties should not only prevent "sharing the limelight" and "setting up a rival court," but also respect their political freedom and organizational independence within the scope stipulated by the Constitution. It is undeniable that the democratic parties have not fully appreciated the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" in the past, because some members of the democratic parties, when the Party organization solicits their opinions, adopt an attitude of obedience and caution, and are unwilling to publicly express their views. When they find that there are shortcomings in some of the Party organization's work, they are also unwilling to offer criticisms, which is not right. If our democratic parties want to earnestly implement the policy of "mutual supervision," we must first correct our ideological attitude. When the United Front Department raises a question and seeks the opinions of the democratic parties, everyone has the responsibility to carefully consider it and put forward their own opinions. However, there are also individual leading members of democratic parties who not only do not do this, but instead regard these opinions as "instructions from the United Front" and "pass them down"; instead of mobilizing the masses to discuss and study, they rigidly ask the masses to "follow and implement." This not only fails to truly implement the intentions of the leadership, but also affects the mutual understanding and trust between members of the democratic parties and hinders the democratic style. This approach is not beneficial to the Party and the democratic parties themselves. How should democratic parties do a good job in united front work? I think that first of all, we must wholeheartedly accept the leadership and supervision of the Party, strengthen the unity and education of members of the democratic parties, carry out self-transformation through study and work practice, gradually improve our political and professional level, so that they can发挥 their enthusiasm in the socialist cause and make better achievements. Secondly, we must fully promote democracy, encourage members to offer more criticisms and suggestions on certain shortcomings in the work of the Party organization and within the democratic parties, fully开展 criticism and self-criticism within the association, strengthen contact and unity education with the masses of all strata, listen to their different opinions and suggestions from all sides, promptly总结 work experience, correct shortcomings, and improve the organization. Only in this way can we work together and make progress together under the correct leadership of the Communist Party.

### 对统一战线工作的几点体会

    对统一战线工作的几点体会
    中国民主建国会中央委员　林志澄
    我是国外留学回来的一个工程技术人员，多年来都在广州经营机器制造业。解放后，由于中国共产党对我不断地培养和教育，使我有更多的机会在学习和工作中得到锻炼，不断地改造自己的思想和逐步提高政治思想水平。七年来，我深刻地体会党对知识分子无微不至的关怀和爱护，也深深地体会到党的统一战线政策的伟大。在学习党的第八次全国代表大会文件以后，我仅对目前广东省、广州市的统一战线工作，提供一些意见。不正确之处，请同志们批评指正。
    一、关于充分发挥我国知识分子的潜在力量问题
    工人、农民和知识分子的坚固的联盟，是建设社会主义的重要保证。近几个月来，有关部门为了贯彻执行党和国家对知识分子的政策，进一步发挥我国知识分子的潜在力量，已在积极展开招聘工作，吸收更多的专家、高级知识分子为国家的经济、文化建设事业服务。这是一件令人鼓舞和兴奋的大事情。
    但是，在录用知识分子的工作中，还存在着要求过高的偏向，特别是对年纪较大，或有一些政治历史问题的人，不少仍不愿录用，即使录用了，在政治地位和物质待遇上也往往有所歧视。这样，无疑会增加知识分子就业的顾虑和困难。试举二个例子来说明：广州市有一位机关干部，解放前是大学教授，曾通过他的学生收集有关统计资料供给当时的共产党地下组织。解放后在市属机关供职，因他以前曾做过某伪国大代表的秘书，领导上认为他历史复杂，于1953年被撤职，引起生活极度困难。今年我获悉这事后，即反映给中共广州市委，经党组织深入了解后，认为该单位处理失当，已予录用，并给予更重要的职务，现在这位干部在自己的岗位上工作得很好。又如广州市有一位老专家，对造纸工业有数十年的经验，解放初期，因与企业的军事代表有意见，被调返省工业厅工作。以后，就处处受到该单位领导的歧视，引起他精神上极度的痛苦。最近该单位检查了对知识分子的政策以后，他得到了组织上的信任，在工作上发挥了很大的积极性。
    对知识分子进行统一战线工作，不要忘记我国知识分子的特点。知识分子都是从旧社会过来的，他们在不同程度上都有着若干政治历史问题，这是很自然的。因此，对录用知识分子不正确的态度会惹起他们的思想顾虑。这点，希望有关部门充分加以注意。
    二、关于贯彻统一战线工作的政策和相互监督的问题
    （一）统战工作是非常复杂、细致的工作。为了做好这个工作，领导上要能够正确地掌握原则，经常和群众接触。有些群众批评统战工作是“统上不统下”，是说过去在统战工作中存在联系面不广，工作不深入的缺点，这是应该改进的。其次希望领导方面加强对干部工作的检查和思想教育，把统战政策精神正确地贯彻到具体工作中，以避免在群众中造成不良影响。
    （二）要作好统一战线工作，领导上必须重视群众的意见，对群众反映出来的意见或建议，要迅速处理，做到有交代、有着落。群众的正确意见及积极有益的建议，固然要迅速采纳实行，对不正确的意见或办不到的事情，也应及时进行解释，以教育群众。在1955年时，广州市国家资本主义办公室对改造私人工商业工作能充分重视，曾指定一干部专责与我联系，因此工商界反映的许多建议和意见，都能迅速地转到有关部门，及时处理。这样做法是一种良好的联系方式，很受工商界欢迎。我现在建议广东省第八办公室也这样做，使上下更能通气。
    （三）要善于认真地听取不同的意见。刘少奇同志在党的第八次代表大会的政治报告中曾说：“容许不同观点的无拘束的争论，以便比较全面地反映党内外群众的各种意见，也就是比较全面地反映客观事物发展过程中的各个侧面。”这个指示对统一战线工作来说，同样具有深刻的意义。如果领导干部在会议或座谈会上，只满足于那些随声应和、唯唯诺诺的庸俗气氛，不欢喜听取不同的甚至相反的意见，这样将会大大地削弱我们的民主生活，损害了群众意见的积极性，以致使工作上发生偏差。当然这里所指的不同意见或者相反意见，并不是那些故意标新立异，遇事与领导抗衡的“意见”，更不是那些存心捣乱、企图损害社会主义事业的“意见”，而是持之有故，言之成理，并从社会主义利益出发的、建设性的意见。这一界限，我们必须好好地领会和掌握。
    为了贯彻执行共产党同其他民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，在民主党派方面，既应防止“平分秋色”、“分庭抗礼”，也应该在宪法规定的范围内尊重自己的政治自由和组织的独立性。无可讳言，对“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，过去民主党派体会得不够深刻，因为有些民主党派成员，在党组织征询他们意见时，抱着唯唯诺诺、奉命唯谨的态度，不肯公开发表自己的主张。发现党组织某些工作有缺点时，亦不肯提出批评意见，这是不对的。我们民主党派要认真贯彻“互相监督”的方针，就首先要端正思想态度，当统战部把某个问题提出来征求民主党派的意见时，大家就有责任加以慎重考虑并提出自己的意见。但也有个别的民主党派领导人员，不仅没有这样做，反而把这些意见作为统战的“指示下达”；不是发动群众讨论研究，而是生硬地要群众“遵照执行”。这样固然不能真正贯彻领导上的意图，而且会影响民主党派成员彼此之间的互相了解和信任，使民主作风受到窒碍。这样做法，对党和民主党派本身，都不会有什么好处。民主党派组织应该怎样来做好统战工作呢？我以为首先要衷心地接受党的领导和监督，加强对民主党派成员的团结教育，通过学习和工作的实践来进行自我改造，逐步提高政治和业务水平，使他们在社会主义事业中发挥他们的积极性，作出更好的成绩。其次，要充分发扬民主，鼓励成员对党组织和民主党派内部工作上的某些缺点，多提出批评的意见和建议，在会内充分开展批评和自我批评，加强对各阶层群众的联系和团结教育，听取他们的来自各方面的不同意见和建议，及时总结工作经验，改正缺点，健全组织。只有这样，才能够在共产党的正确领导下，共同工作，共同进步。
