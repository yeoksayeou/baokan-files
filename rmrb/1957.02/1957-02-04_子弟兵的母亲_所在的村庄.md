The village where the "Mother of the Soldiers," Rong Guanxiu, lives—Xiapan Song in Guangyu Township, Jianping County, Hebei Province—has undergone great changes in recent years. In 1955, the Guangyu Agricultural Cooperative (advanced cooperative) consisting of 68 households was established here, with Rong Guanxiu as the deputy director. In order to improve production and develop a diversified mountain economy, the cooperative members worked diligently on 440 mu of land and actively planted many trees. Although the area suffered from wind and rain disasters in 1956, its output still exceeded that of 1955.

The "Mother of the Soldiers," Rong Guanxiu, took the lead in developing production and organizing mutual aid groups as early as 1943. Since then, the morning bell has become the signal for the people here to go to the fields to work. Although other methods have now replaced the bell ringing, the role that this bell played in the past, and the expression of Mother Rong Guanxiu ringing the bell (see left picture), are still deeply imprinted in people's memories, inspiring them to move forward.

(Except for the photo of Rong Guanxiu ringing the bell, which was taken by Jiang Bo in the past, all the photos in this set were recently taken by Yuan Hao.) (Photos attached)

### “子弟兵的母亲”所在的村庄

    “子弟兵的母亲”所在的村庄
    子弟兵的母亲戎冠秀所在的村庄——河北省建屏县光宇乡下盘松，几年来变化很大。1955年，这里建立了六十八户组成的光宇农业社（高级社），戎冠秀是这个社的副主任。社员们为了搞好生产、发展山区多种经济，在四百四十亩土地上进行了辛勤的劳动，并积极地栽种了许多林木。这个地方1956年虽然遭受了风雨灾害，产量仍然超过了1955年。
    “子弟兵的母亲”戎冠秀，1943年就带头发展生产，组织互助组。从那时候起，黎明的钟声就成了这里的人们下地生产的信号。现在虽然用别的方法代替了敲钟，但这座钟过去发挥的作用，和戎冠秀老妈妈敲钟的神态（见左图），仍然深深地留在人们的记忆中，鼓舞着人们前进。
