Recently, reporters visited the Friendship Hospital in Urumqi. This hospital was originally established by the Soviet Union and was transferred to our country free of charge a year ago. To commemorate the sincere friendship of the Soviet government, this hospital was named "Friendship Hospital," and four experienced Soviet female medical experts are still employed here as doctors in internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics.

The female doctors all have more than fifteen years of work experience. The white-haired pediatric expert, Nadali Ivanovna, worked at the Moscow Children's Hospital for thirty years.

In October last year, a Uyghur farmer named Mamutihalike, suffering from a severe stomach ulcer, was escorted by his family from Turpan to the Urumqi Friendship Hospital. The patient was vomiting blood profusely, his face was sallow, and he was on the verge of death. Chinese and Soviet doctors in the hospital immediately conducted an emergency consultation. Under normal circumstances, a healthy person has more than 5,000 cc of blood; this patient had vomited more than half of that amount, and it seemed that he could not be saved. However, Soviet surgeon Alexandra Antonovna believed that the doctor's highest duty is to do their best to heal the wounded and rescue the dying. It was decided to immediately perform a gastrectomy. Gastrectomy is a major abdominal surgery. Antonovna and a Chinese doctor jointly performed this surgery. More than twenty days later, the patient finally passed the danger period and recovered his health. During this period, Antonovna often personally washed the stomach, administered oxygen, and performed other nursing work for the comatose patient during the day. When she returned home in the evening, she would either call to inquire about the patient's condition or run back to the hospital to check on the condition herself. This female surgeon had served as a front-line doctor in the Soviet Patriotic War, and years of battlefield life had cultivated her calm, firm character and careful, patient work style. Sometimes she performed as many as three surgeries during the day and continued to work at night.

Many patients at the Friendship Hospital, after recovering and being discharged, still remember the life-saving kindness of the Soviet doctors. They wrote letters to thank the Soviet doctors and gave them photos as mementos. Pediatric expert Nadali Ivanovna has received dozens of photos of children of various ethnic groups in China. Many photos have words of gratitude from the mothers on the back. Whenever she has free time, she always happily takes out these photos and looks at them again and again. These innocent little faces once took a lot of Nadali Ivanovna's effort.

One summer night last year, a Tatar baby named Ilik, less than a week old, suddenly vomited blood. The Chinese doctor on duty lacked experience and could not determine the infant's condition, so he called Nadali Ivanovna, who had already left work and returned home. Nadali Ivanovna rushed to the hospital immediately after receiving the call. She examined the condition in detail and took emergency treatment. And personally stayed by the baby's bed until late at night when the baby was out of danger.

When diagnosing illnesses, these Soviet female doctors study with Chinese doctors and explain the pathology at any time. When encountering complex treatment work, they often let Chinese doctors take the lead and closely follow them, providing guidance at any time. More than a month ago, a Tatar woman named Shageya came to the Friendship Hospital to give birth to her first child. Because her pelvis was slightly small, she had a difficult labor. The woman moaned constantly, and by the afternoon of the third day, the child had still not been born. The Chinese doctor guarding her discovered that there was a risk of uterine rupture and suggested a cesarean section to remove the baby. Soviet obstetrician and gynecologist Genus Lijievanna, after careful examination, found that the amniotic fluid had not yet ruptured and flowed out, and the uterus might not rupture temporarily. If surgery was performed, it would bring a lot of pain to the young mother. So she guarded with the Chinese doctor, and at more than one o'clock in the morning, Shageya finally safely gave birth to her first baby with the help of the Soviet doctor.

In this way, under the painstaking guidance of Soviet doctors, the nine Chinese doctors in this hospital have learned a lot of advanced medical knowledge. Uyghur surgeon Hamiti graduated from Lanzhou University School of Medicine only half a year ago, and now he is able to independently perform abdominal surgeries such as hernia repair and cholecystolithotomy. In addition to imparting experience clinically, Soviet experts also compile their medical experience into systematic lecture notes and use their rest time to give lectures to Chinese doctors.

Chinese and Soviet medical personnel have developed a deep friendship in the short process of cooperation. Whenever there are New Year's or holidays, Chinese comrades in the hospital go to pay them a visit. Some people even invite Soviet doctors to their homes to celebrate the holidays together. When the news that a Soviet doctor was about to return to her country recently came out, some Chinese medical staff couldn't help but shed tears.

    苏联女大夫在友谊医院
    新华社记者　杨克现　丁文
    最近，记者访问了乌鲁木齐市的友谊医院。这个医院原来是苏联举办的，一年前已经无偿地移交我国。为了纪念苏联政府真挚的友情，这个医院被命名为“友谊医院”，并且仍然聘请了富有经验的四位苏联女医学专家在这里担任内科、外科、妇产科和小儿科的医生职务。
    女大夫们都已经有十五年以上的工作经验。头发雪白的儿科专家娜达丽·依万诺芙娜，曾经在莫斯科儿童医院工作了整整三十年。
    去年10月间，一个患有严重胃溃疡的维吾尔族农民马木提哈力克，在家人护送下从吐鲁番来到了乌鲁木齐友谊医院。病人大口吐血，脸色腊黄，奄奄一息。医院里的中国和苏联医生立即进行了紧急会诊。在一般情况下，一个健康的人约有五千多西西血液，这个病人吐血量已超过了一半，看来已是无法挽救了。然而，苏联外科大夫亚历山大·安托诺芙娜却认为：医生最高的职责，是要尽最大努力救死扶伤。决定立即进行胃切除的手术。胃切除手术是腹腔外科的大手术。安托诺芙娜和中国大夫共同担任了这一手术。二十多天后，病人终于度过危险期，恢复了健康。这期间，安托诺芙娜白天常常亲自给昏迷不醒的病人洗胃、输氧和进行其他护理工作。晚上回到家里不是打电话询问病状，就是又跑回医院亲自检查一次病情。这位外科女大夫在苏联卫国战争中曾经担任过前线医生，多年战地生活锻炼出她沉着、坚定的性格和仔细、耐心的工作作风。有时她白天动手术三次之多，晚上还继续坚持工作。
    友谊医院的许多病人病愈出院后还念念不忘苏联医生救命的恩情，他们写信感谢苏联医生，赠送照片给她们留念。儿科专家娜达丽·依万诺芙娜就接到了数十张中国各族儿童的照片。许多照片背面留下了母亲感激的话语。每逢闲暇，她总高兴地把这些照片取出来看了再看。这些天真的小面孔曾经花费了娜达丽·依万诺芙娜不少的心血。
    去年夏天的一个夜晚。出生不满一周的塔塔尔族婴儿伊丽克，突然口吐鲜血。住院的中国医生缺乏经验，无法判断婴儿病情，就打电话告诉已经下班回家的娜达丽·依万诺芙娜。娜达丽·依万诺芙娜接到电话后立即赶到医院。她详细地检查了病况，采取了紧急治疗。并且亲自守在婴儿床边，直到深夜婴儿脱离险境。
    这几位苏联女大夫诊断病情时，都和中国医生一起研究，随时地解释病理。遇到复杂病情的治疗工作，多让中国大夫主治，自己紧跟在中国大夫身边，随时进行指导。一个多月前，塔塔尔族产妇沙格雅来到友谊医院生第一胎孩子。因为骨盆稍小而难产。产妇不断呻吟，直到第三天下午，孩子还没有生下来。守护的中国医生发觉子宫有破裂的危险，提出剖腹取出婴儿的意见。苏联妇产科医生葛奴斯·立杰依万娜经过仔细检查，发现羊水还没有破裂外流，子宫暂时还可能不会破裂，如果开刀，对年青的母亲，会带来许多痛苦，于是她和中国医生一起守护，到深夜一点多钟，沙格雅终于在苏联大夫的助产下，安全地生下了第一个婴儿。
    就这样，在苏联医生的苦心教导下，这个医院的九名中国医生学会了许多先进的医疗知识。维吾尔族外科医生哈米提半年以前才从兰州大学医学院毕业，现在已经能够单独地进行疝气修补、胆囊石切除等腹腔手术。苏联专家们除临床传授经验外，还把自己医疗经验编写成系统的讲义，利用休息时间给中国大夫讲课。
    中苏两国医务人员在短短的合作过程中，已产生了深厚的友谊。每逢过年过节，医院里的中国同志便去给她们拜节，有的人还邀请苏联医生来自己家里一起过节。当一位苏联医生最近要回国的消息传出后，有的中国医务人员情不自禁地流下了眼泪。
