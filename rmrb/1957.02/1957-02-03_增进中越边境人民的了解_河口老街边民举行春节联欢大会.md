Hekou, February 2nd (by our own correspondent) To enhance mutual understanding between the people on the Sino-Vietnamese border, a Spring Festival celebration was held today in Hekou for residents of the Hekou and Lao Cai border areas. At 8:40 AM, a delegation of thirty people from Lao Cai, Vietnam, led by Truong Minh, Secretary of the Lao Cai Provincial Party Committee, arrived in Hekou via the Sino-Vietnamese bridge connecting Hekou and Lao Cai. Accompanying the delegation were over three thousand residents from Lao Cai, including a basketball team, volleyball team, ping-pong team, a film crew, and an arts troupe composed of one hundred people.

When the delegation passed under the colorful archway at the bridgehead, adorned with the national flags of China and Vietnam and the words "Welcome Vietnamese Comrades" in both Chinese and Vietnamese, the over one thousand residents of various ethnic groups and overseas Vietnamese in Hekou, who had been waiting, erupted in cheers. Thousands of colorful flags were waved, and slogans and the sound of drums filled the air. Nong Kaiguo, the head of Hekou County, Xu Hongzhi, the Secretary of the County Party Committee, and others who came to welcome the delegation shook hands with the representatives of the Lao Cai residents. A large group of girls dressed in their ethnic costumes rushed forward, offering bouquets of flowers wrapped in betel leaves to the Lao Cai resident representatives. Showers of multi-colored confetti fell, cheers rose one after another, and firecrackers echoed throughout the quiet border town. Our close neighbors – friends from Vietnam – advanced slowly through this warm sea of friendship.

At 11:00 AM, accompanied by Nong Kaiguo, the head of Hekou County, Xu Hongzhi, the Secretary of the County Party Committee, and others, the Lao Cai resident representatives entered the venue and ascended the simple yet solemn rostrum. The venue immediately erupted in thunderous applause and the sound of drums. The meeting began, and Nong Kaiguo, the head of Hekou County, expressed the sentiments of the people of all ethnic groups in Hekou. He said: The residents of Hekou and Lao Cai, living on both sides of the Red River, have been close neighbors since ancient times, and even more so, brothers in adversity for the past hundred years. The people of both countries have always sympathized with and supported each other in their respective struggles for national independence and people's democracy. Now, the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are both fraternal countries in the socialist camp. The border residents of Hekou and Lao Cai mostly belong to the same ethnic group. They share a common language, culture, and customs, and have always had close blood ties and economic and cultural connections and exchanges. Truly, mountains are connected to mountains, waters are connected to waters, and hearts are connected to hearts. It is a joy we have long awaited to celebrate the festival together with our brotherly residents of Lao Cai today. He then stated that the people of Hekou, together with the entire Chinese people, would forever support the Vietnamese people's struggle for the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of their motherland.

Truong Minh, the head of the Lao Cai resident delegation, then spoke. He said: We are very pleased and excited to have been invited by the People's Government of Hekou County, People's Republic of China, to participate in the Spring Festival celebration.

Delegation Leader Truong Minh briefly described the close geographical and ethnic relations between the people of China and Vietnam, especially the people of Hekou and Lao Cai, and the long-standing history of friendship, sharing weal and woe and supporting each other. He also firmly believed that with the close unity and assistance of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, the Vietnamese people would surely be victorious.

The heartfelt speeches of County Head Nong Kaiguo and Delegation Leader Truong Minh were met with sustained applause from the border residents of both sides. The Lao Cai residents and over two thousand Hekou residents shouted in different languages, "Long live the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of China and Vietnam," "Long live Chairman Mao," "Long live President Ho," and "Long live world peace."

It was noon, and the meeting was temporarily adjourned. From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, over five thousand residents of various ethnic groups from Hekou and Lao Cai held a joint celebration.

Hekou, February 2nd (by our own correspondent) Tonight at 7:00 PM, a Spring Festival banquet was held at the Hekou Guesthouse for residents of the Hekou and Lao Cai border areas. The banquet was hosted by the Hekou County People's Committee. Attending the banquet were the Lao Cai resident delegation, comrades from the Hekou Overseas Vietnamese Association, and responsible comrades from the Party and government of Hekou County. At the banquet, the two sides engaged in cordial conversations and congratulations. The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere, and ended at 9:30 PM with the singing of "Unity is Strength."
