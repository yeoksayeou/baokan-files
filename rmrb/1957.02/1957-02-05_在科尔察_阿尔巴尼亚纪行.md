    In Korçë
    ——An Albanian Travelogue——
              Lin Li
    The car from Tirana sped for six hours, bringing us to the southeastern corner of Albania.

    Here is Korçë, 181 kilometers from Tirana. Not far to the east lies the land of Yugoslavia.

    Before arriving in Korçë, I had heard many legends about this heroic city. In 1886, Albania's first Albanian-language primary school appeared here. Teachers and students risked their lives, treating the study of their national language as a weapon to fight against the Turkish rulers. During the Italian fascist occupation, the brewery workers, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, set fire to the warehouse and sneaked into the mountains to organize guerrillas. On the day the German bandits entered Korçë, the people bravely held a large-scale demonstration with unprecedented anger. In this struggle, fifty-nine patriotic people sacrificed their lives, more than one hundred and twenty outstanding young people were wounded, and more people were arrested, exiled, and detained. However, bullets, blood, and prisons did not frighten the freedom-loving people of Korçë. They ran into the mountains in groups and joined the guerrillas led by the Communists, re-igniting the torch of fighting for national independence and freedom.

    In the eyes of the Albanian people, Korçë is like Yan'an in China, and is praised as a glorious revolutionary base. Because before the founding of the Albanian Communist Party, the communist group here was one of the earliest, most active, and most effective revolutionary organizations in the country. Ali Kelmendi, the first to bring Marxism to the Albanian people, grew up here. Comrade Enver Hoxha, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, also worked here for a long time...

    The history of Korçë is glorious, and the current achievements of Korçë are also admirable.

    Miti Lapo, the Secretary of the Regional Committee, and Vasili Narazani received me. When they introduced rural work, they said that the agricultural collectivization movement in the Korçë region has a full ten-year history. Both the number of cooperatives and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives are more than in other regions. Now, there are one hundred and thirteen agricultural production cooperatives and seventy-six mutual aid groups in the Korçë region. The number of farmers joining the cooperatives has reached 35% of all farmers, and the cultivated land occupied by the cooperatives accounts for 40% of the total cultivated area. In grain-producing areas and plains, many villages have basically been collectivized. In order to promote the development of agricultural collectivization, the Korçë region has successively established three machine tractor stations, with one hundred and fifty tractors. The land cultivated by tractors accounts for 70% to 80% of the total cultivated area. The Maliq area of Korçë was originally a lake and swamp. Since the slogan of improving the soil and seizing land from nature was put forward, the lake water has been drained, and the swamp has been turned into 4,500 hectares of fertile land. The result of opening canals and repairing rivers has turned more than 4,000 hectares of dry land in the Korçë region into paddy fields. Those malaria-ridden areas where mosquitoes used to run rampant are now raw material bases for the sugar industry. The vast majority of the cotton needed by the cotton textile factory is supplied by Korçë. The development of agricultural collectivization and mechanization has greatly improved the material and cultural living standards of farmers. Before the war, the illiteracy rate in the Korçë region accounted for more than 90% of the total population. Now, people under the age of forty have a cultural level of primary school or above. The Third District, which has forty-one villages, has small power generation equipment in twenty-eight villages.

    With the help of the Regional Committee, I visited one of the three tractor stations in the Korçë region.

    The station director is called Bejted Çungursani, and he is twenty-nine years old this year. During the war, he was a youth cadre in the People's Army. After the war, he was the secretary of the Labor Youth League in Durrës. During the period of national economic recovery, he responded to the call of the Party, volunteered to transfer to the economic front, and was assigned to the Durrës machine tractor station. At that time, there were only a few old and broken machines in the station, and most of the employees were demobilized soldiers who did not understand technology. What made him particularly annoyed was managing the money. He repeatedly asked the organization to transfer him back, but the Ministry of Agriculture gave him a severe criticism, saying that he "wanted to be a deserter in the face of difficulties." Deserter - this was a great insult to a soldier who had participated in the national liberation war. However, Bejted Çungursani did not act rashly. He felt that the Ministry of Agriculture was right to criticize him. When the motherland needs her sons and daughters to engage in construction and economic work, how can Bejted Çungursani fail the needs of the motherland? So, he abandoned his personal interests, put aside his troubles, and happily continued to work at the tractor station.

    Bejted Çungursani quickly learned the skills of managing a machine tractor station, and then participated in the swamp drying project in the Kavaja area. The machine tractor station under his leadership won the prize and became one of the outstanding machine tractor stations. Before being transferred to the machine tractor station in Korçë, he was already a skilled tractor station director.

    The Korçë machine tractor station was established on February 15, 1947. At that time, in addition to fighting against the backward situation of not understanding technology, they also had to do mobilization work among the farmers. People still remember that when their tractors first drove to the village of Gështas, the farmers did not accept their support. People said that tractors destroy the "earth energy" and that the fields cultivated by tractors do not grow crops. Saboteurs and class enemies also took the opportunity to fabricate all kinds of rumors. In this case, the comrades of the tractor station were not in a hurry. They held a meeting of Communist Party members to explain the benefits of plowing the land with tractors and called on Party members to plow the land with tractors. They did a lot of hard and meticulous work before a party member was willing to use a tractor. It was not until crops grew in this party member's field that other party members began to use tractors. Because the vast majority of farmers did not understand the benefits of tractors, only ninety hectares of land were cultivated that spring. Despite this, the Party and the government continued to give them a lot of encouragement, saying that they did not force orders and adhered to the principle of farmers' voluntariness, saying that with this foundation, they could quickly expand in the future. The fact is exactly like this. As soon as the spring plowing of the second year arrived, the farmers rushed to the tractor station to "ask for tractors." Some activists, seeing that tractors were inconvenient to move on small plots of land, proposed abolishing land boundaries and organizing agricultural cooperatives. They also suggested that the tractor station increase the number of tractors. Over the past few years, the tractor station, which initially had only six old-fashioned tractors, now has one hundred and one of the latest tractors, and the cultivated land has expanded from the first year's ninety hectares to more than 32,000 hectares. In addition, the tractor station has also established its own repair shop, and the number of employees has increased to 210. More than 90% of the Labor Party members and Youth League members of this station participate in field labor. Therefore, the work tasks are always overfulfilled, and they have been awarded the red flag by the Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers twice.

    The countryside of Korçë, like the city of Korçë, has a glorious history.

    In the village of Baban, which I visited, thirty-five people joined the army and seven sacrificed in the anti-fascist war. One of them, called Buhar Baban, was particularly famous. Buhar Baban originally studied at the Italian Military Academy. Not long after returning to China, he encountered the Italian fascist war of aggression. When the motherland was in danger, Buhar Baban tore up the diploma given to him by the Italians and resolutely organized a guerrilla team with his compatriots. Because of his bravery in combat, he quickly became a guerrilla captain and became a well-known hero. In an encounter, his guerrilla team fought a bloody battle with the enemy all day long. In the case of running out of ammunition and being without support, he attracted the enemy to his front, allowing his comrades to safely escape the danger. When the enemy discovered that he was Buhar Baban and persuaded him to surrender, he shot and killed the enemy representative and ended his life with the last bullet. Therefore, Baban village built the Buhar Baban Cemetery after the war, and the villagers named their village and agricultural production cooperative after Baban.

    This is an area of undulating hills, with mountains but no stones, and the land is golden, which looks extraordinarily tranquil. The temperature is much lower than in Tirana. The southeastern mountains within sight are the dividing line between Albania and Greece.

    When the people of Baban village heard that "Kinezi (Chinese)" had come, they all put down their work in the fields and ran over. Party branch secretary, cooperative chairman, livestock director, primary school teacher... The village cadres here, like many rural workers in China, each have a notebook. They answered the various questions I raised.

    There are 189 households in Baban village, and the agricultural cooperative was established in September 1949. There were only forty-eight households at the beginning. At the end of 1955, except for two rich peasant households, all of them joined the cooperative. The main crops are wheat and beets, and livestock production is also a large income. People say that after collectivization, the output of various agricultural products has greatly increased. For example, wheat only yielded eight quintals per hectare when working individually, but now it has reached nineteen quintals. The average income for a working day is six kilograms of grain, seventy leks in currency, and other in-kind benefits. Farmers' material lives have improved, and their cultural lives have also improved. They have changed the past four-year primary school to a seven-year one. An eighty-person choir was organized. Power generation equipment was installed in the winter of 1953, and a cinema is planned to be built this year. The villagers have more than ten radios. The village cadres explained that the biggest change is for women. In the past, women did not go to the fields, let alone sing. Now, more than half of the members of the choir are women, and they can also perform on stage. ...

    People talked to me a lot, very naturally and sincerely. At the same time, they also frankly raised a series of questions to me, from the Chinese Communist Party's current stage of class policy to the cultivation methods of Chinese rice, totaling no less than thirty. I was deeply moved by their strong interest and deep concern for the Chinese people. Although China and Albania are thousands of miles apart, the close friendship of the Albanian people is forever engraved in my heart.

    在科尔察
    ——阿尔巴尼亚纪行——
              林里
    从地拉那开出的汽车，经过六个钟头的奔驰，把我们送到了阿尔巴尼亚的东南角。
    这里是科尔察，离地拉那一百八十一公里。往东不远就是南斯拉夫的土地。
    到科尔察之前，我已听过不少关于这个英雄城市的传说。1886年间，这里出现了阿尔巴尼亚的第一所阿文小学，师生们冒着生命危险，把学习本国语言文字当成跟土耳其统治者斗争的武器。意大利法西斯占领期间，有着光荣革命传统的啤酒厂工人，放火烧毁了仓库，又潜入山区组织游击队。德国强盗进入科尔察的那天，人们以前所未有的愤怒，勇敢地举行了声势浩大的游行示威。在这次斗争中，五十九名爱国志士牺牲了，一百二十多名优秀青年负伤了，更多的人被逮捕、流放、扣押起来了。然而枪弹、鲜血和监狱，都没有吓倒爱好自由的科尔察人。他们成群结伙地跑进山区，加入了共产党人领导下的游击队，重新举起了为祖国独立和自由而战斗的火炬。
    在阿尔巴尼亚人民的眼里，科尔察就像我们中国的延安，被誉为光荣的革命根据地。因为在阿尔巴尼亚共产党成立前，这里的共产主义小组，是全国成立最早、最活跃、也最有成效的革命组织之一。第一个把马克思主义带给阿尔巴尼亚人民的阿里·凯尔曼第是在这里成长的，劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志也曾长期在这里工作……。
    科尔察的历史是光荣的，科尔察的现实成就也是令人钦佩的。
    州委书记米蒂·拉波和华西里·奈良济接待了我。他们介绍农村工作时说，科尔察州的农业合作化运动，已经有了整整十年的历史。合作社和入社农户的数目都比别的州多。现在，科尔察州有一百一十三个农业生产合作社和七十六个互助组，入社农户已达所有农户的35％，入社耕地占所有耕地面积的40％。在产粮区和平原地区，许多村庄已经基本上合作化了。为了推动农业合作化的发展，科尔察州先后建立了三个机器拖拉机站，拥有一百五十台拖拉机。用拖拉机耕作的土地，已占所有耕地面积的70％到80％。科尔察州的马利其地方，原是一片湖泊和沼地。自从提出改良土壤、向大自然夺取土地的口号以后，湖水已被吸干，沼地变成了四千五百公顷良田。开渠修河的结果，使科尔察州的四千多公顷旱地变成了水田。那些以前蚊虫肆虐的瘴疠地区，现在是制糖工业的原料基地。棉纺厂所需要的棉花绝大部分是科尔察供给的。农业合作化和机械化的发展，使农民的物质生活和文化生活水平也大大提高了。战前，科尔察州的文盲占人口总数的90％以上，现在，四十岁以下的人都具有小学以上的文化程度。拥有四十一个乡村的第三区，已有二十八个乡村有了小型发电设备。
    在州委会的帮助下，我访问了科尔察州三个拖拉机站当中的一个。
    站长叫贝捷得·卓古尔萨尼，今年二十九岁。战争时期，他在人民军任青年干事。战后在都拉索的劳动青年联盟当书记。在国民经济恢复时期，他响应党的号召，自愿转到经济战线上，被派到都拉索机器拖拉机站。那时，站上只有几台又老又旧的破机器，职工大都是不懂技术的转业军人。尤其使他懊恼的是管钱。他两次三番要求组织上把他调回去，但农业部给了他一场严厉的批评，说他“想在困难面前当逃兵”。逃兵，——这对一个参加过民族解放战争的战士来说，真是一种极大的侮辱。然而贝捷得·卓古尔萨尼没有冲动。他觉得农业部批评得对。当祖国需要她的儿女们从事建设、从事经济工作的时候，贝捷得·卓古尔萨尼怎能辜负祖国的需要呢？于是，他丢下个人兴趣，抛下烦恼，高高兴兴地又在拖拉机站干下去了。
    贝捷得·卓古尔萨尼很快学会了管理机器拖拉机站的本领，紧接着又参加了卡瓦亚地区的沼地干涸工程。他领导下的机器拖拉机站得了奖，成了出色的机器拖拉机站之一。在调到科尔察的机器拖拉机站来以前，他已是一个熟练的拖拉机站站长了。
    科尔察机器拖拉机站是1947年2月15日成立的。那时，他们除了跟不懂技术的落后状况斗争以外，还要到农民当中去做动员工作。人们都还记得，当他们的拖拉机第一次开到格斯格夫村的时候，农民们都不接受他们的支援。人们说拖拉机破坏“地气”，拖拉机耕过的田不长庄稼。破坏分子和阶级敌人也就乘机编造了种种谣言。在这种情况下，拖拉机站的同志们并没有着急，他们召开共产党员会议，解释拖拉机耕地的好处，号召党员们用拖拉机耕地。他们做了许多艰苦而细致的工作，才有一个党员愿意使用拖拉机。直到这个党员的地里长出庄稼，另外的一些党员才开始使用拖拉机。因为广大农民不懂得拖拉机的好处，这年春天只耕作了九十公顷土地。尽管这样，党和政府还是继续给了他们不少的鼓励，说他们没有强迫命令，坚持了农民自愿的原则，说是有了这个基础，往后就可以迅速扩大。事实也正是这样。第二年的春耕一到，农民们就纷纷到拖拉机站去“请拖拉机”。一些积极分子，看见拖拉机在小块土地上行动不方便，就提议废除地界，组织农业合作社。还建议拖拉机站增加拖拉机。几年来，最初只有六台老式拖拉机的拖拉机站，现在已拥有一百零一台最新式的拖拉机了，耕地也由第一年的九十公顷扩大到了三万二千公顷以上。此外，拖拉机站还建立了自己的修理厂，职工人数增加到了二百一十名。这个站的劳动党党员和青年联盟盟员，90％以上都参加田间劳动。因此，工作任务总是超额完成，曾经两次得到党中央和部长会议奖给他们的红旗。
    科尔察的农村，也像科尔察市一样，有着光荣的历史。
    我所访问的巴朋村，在反法西斯战争中，有三十五人参军，七人牺牲。其中有个叫布哈特·巴朋的，特别出名。布哈特·巴朋原在意大利军事学院学习，回国不久，就遇上了意大利法西斯的侵略战争。在祖国处于危难的时候，布哈特·巴朋撕掉了意大利人给他的毕业证，毅然跟他的同胞一起组织了游击队。因为作战勇敢，很快就当了游击队长，成了远近驰名的英雄。在一次遭遇战中，他的游击队跟敌人血战竟日，在弹尽无援的情况下，他把敌人吸引到自己的面前，让同志们安全地脱离了险地。在敌人发现他是布哈特·巴朋而劝他投降的时候，他开枪打死了敌人的代表，又用最后一颗子弹结束了自己的生命。因此，巴朋村在战后修建了布哈特·巴朋墓，村里的人并以巴朋命名他们的村子和农业生产合作社。
    这里是一带起伏不平的丘陵，有山无石，土地金黄，看来异常恬静。气温比地拉那低得多。视线所及的东南群山，是阿尔巴尼亚—希腊的分界线。
    巴朋村的人们听说来了“基乃斯（中国人）”，全都放下地里的活计跑来了。党支部书记、合作社主席、畜牧主任、小学教师……。这里的村干部，也像我们中国的许多农村工作者一样，每人都有一个笔记本。他们回答了我提出的各项问题。
    巴朋村有一百八十九户，农业合作社是1949年9月建立的。开始只有四十八户，1955年底，除了两户富农之外，全都入社了。农作物主要是小麦和甜菜，畜牧业生产也是一项大收入。人们说，合作化以后，各项农产品产量都大大提高了，比如小麦，单干时每公顷不过收八公担，现在已经达到十九公担。一个劳动日，平均收入是六公斤粮食，货币七十里克，还有其他实物。农民的物质生活提高了，文化生活也改善了。他们把过去的一所四年制小学改成了七年制。组织了八十个人的合唱团。1953年冬天安装了发电设备，计划今年修建电影院。村民有十多部收音机。村干部们解释说，变化最大的是妇女。过去妇女不下地，更不能唱歌，现在的合唱团团员，半数以上是妇女，而且还能登台演戏。……
    人们跟我谈了许多，谈得很自然，很诚恳。同时，他们也坦率地向我提出一连串的问题，从中国共产党现阶段的阶级政策，到中国水稻的栽培方法，总共不下三十个。他们对中国人民所表现的这样浓厚的兴趣和深切的关怀，使我深受感动。中国和阿尔巴尼亚虽然相去万里，但阿尔巴尼亚人民的亲密的友情却永远铭记在我的心里。
