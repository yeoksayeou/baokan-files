    Spring Comes to the Water Dwellings
      Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Weiqun, Li Zuoji
    The southeast wind has already blown back to the Pearl River, and the river water is warm. Spring has come to the water dwellings of Guangzhou City.
    From the afternoon of the day before the Spring Festival to the early morning of the day after the Spring Festival, firecrackers resounded continuously across the Pearl River for more than ten kilometers through the urban area of Guangzhou, as the water dwellers welcomed the Spring Festival and received blessings in thousands of boats. On New Year's Eve, the reporter walked from Shamian at the western end of the central area of Guangzhou along the South Bank and the East Bank, counting along the way, and saw dozens of small pier docks with houseboats, passenger boats, and tourist boats parked side by side, as dense as combs.... Almost every boat head had already been pasted with "red money paper," inserted with incense, and placed with several stalks of celery, scallions, and lettuce tied with red paper strips, as well as two golden oranges and a red envelope containing New Year's money. The reporter asked the water dwellers, and it turned out that these symbolize diligence, cleverness, vitality, and good luck.
    On the East Bank, hundreds of passenger boats and tourist boats were concentrated, with various potted flowers and bottle flowers displayed on the boat heads, truly a riot of colors, a pleasant spring scene. Usually, this place is full of guests every day. There were not many tourists on New Year's Eve, which was a good time for the hosts to reunite and have fun. When the reporter arrived here, many water dwellers had already drunk their reunion dinner wine and were preparing to go to the flower market on land or participate in a gala, while others were sitting in the boats playing cards and chess. Some girls and young men were discussing their Spring Festival travel plans. At the end of a pier dock, the reporter found Mai En, the director of the women's association of this dock, who invited us to her boat. The bulkheads of the passenger boat were inlaid with bas-reliefs and painted screens, which were very elegant. The director of the women's association was very happy that her son, who works in a petroleum company, was coming home to spend the Spring Festival with his mother. This young man was very handsome and strong. The young man said that he had only graduated from junior high school the year before last, and he paid great attention to physical exercise at school, but he also buried himself in reading day and night, which caused him to become nearsighted. Now he wears glasses. Mai En explained for him: "In the past, the water dwellers were contemptuously called 'Tankas,' and people said, 'Tanka boy, Tanka boat, three feet away from the water is not your share.' You think, after liberation, he was able to go to middle school, how could he not study desperately!" Mai En also told the reporter that there were already eleven middle school students in the fifty-plus households of water dwellers at this dock.
    Before the Spring Festival, the reporter also went to two wooden sailboat transportation cooperatives. Both cooperatives slaughtered the large, fat pigs they had raised and distributed them to the members to celebrate the festival, and also distributed wages and dividends in advance. At the office of one cooperative, the reporter met a middle-aged couple. They were both dressed neatly. The woman had permed hair, wore new leather shoes, and had a jade bracelet on her right wrist; the man also wore a watch. The reporter visited them on their boat. It was a wooden sailboat of dozens of tons that transported stone to the cement factory. The stern cabin was their "home." New floral cloth quilts were stacked on the bed, and a radio was placed on the tall rice bucket near the head of the bed. The deck, furniture, pots, and stoves were all scrubbed clean and shiny. The hostess poured two bowls of boiled water from the thermos for the reporter to drink, then pulled the little girl who was jumping around on the boat to her side, adding a floral dress for her, and said: The cooperative will open a nursery after the Spring Festival, it would be great to send this little devil to the nursery. The couple talked excitedly with the reporter about the benefits of cooperation.
    During these two days of the Spring Festival, the water dwellers all paid New Year's visits to each other to celebrate the Spring Festival, and relatives from afar also came in small boats. People on land also paid New Year's visits to the water dwellers.

    春到水上人家
      新华社记者　杨伟群　黎作骥
    珠江上已经吹回东南风了，江水暖和和的。春，来到了广州市的水上人家。
    从春节的前一天下午起到春节的后一天凌晨，横贯广州市区十多公里的珠江上，连连续续响起鞭炮，水上人家千船万艇都在“迎春接福”。除夕，记者从广州市中心区西端的沙面沿着南堤、东堤走去，一路数数，有好几十个小艇码头的小栈桥两旁，并排湾泊着密如栉比的住家艇、住客艇和游客艇……。几乎每个艇头上都已经贴了“红钱纸”，插上香，放着用红纸条扎着的几棵芹菜、葱、生菜，还有两个金黄的桔子和一封压岁钱。记者问过水上人家，原来这些是象征勤快、聪明、生气勃勃、大吉大利。
    在东堤，集中地停泊着好几百只住客艇和游客艇，艇头分别摆设有各种盆花、瓶花，真是群芳吐艳，春色宜人。平时，这里日日客满。除夕旅客不多，正是主人们团聚玩乐的好时机。记者到这里时，许多水上人家都已经饮过团年酒，准备到陆岸上去逛花市或参加联欢晚会，也有的坐在艇里打牌、下棋。有的姑娘、小伙子正商量着春节旅行的事。记者在一个码头栈桥的末端，找到了这个码头的妇女会主任麦奀，她希望我们到她艇里。客艇里的板壁镶满浮雕、画屏，十分雅致。妇女会主任很高兴，她的在石油公司工作的儿子正回家来和妈妈一起过春节。这小伙子长得很漂亮，很强壮。小伙子说，他前年才从初中毕业，在学校时很注意锻炼身体，但是却不管昼夜地埋头读书，以致弄成近视眼。现在他眼上戴着一副眼镜。麦奀便为他解释说：“过去水上人家被贱称为‘蛋家’，人们说‘蛋家仔、蛋家船，离水三丈没你份’。你想，解放后他能读上中学，怎不拼命读啊！”麦奀还告诉记者，这个码头五十多户水上人家已经有十一个中学生了。
    春节前，记者还到了两个木帆船运输合作社。这两个社都把自养的大肥猪杀了分给社员过节，还提前分发工资和红利。在一个社的办事处，记者遇到一对中年夫妇，他俩穿得都很整齐，女的烫了发，穿着新皮鞋，右手带个玉镯；男的也带着手表。记者到他俩的船上作了访问。那是给水泥厂运石料的载重数十吨的一艘木帆船。船尾舱就是他俩的“住宅”。床上叠着新花布面的棉被，靠近床头的高大的米桶上安放着收音机。船板、家具和锅灶都洗擦得洁净光亮。主妇从热水瓶倒了两碗开水请记者喝，然后把在船上跳跳蹦蹦玩着的小女孩拉到身边，一面给她添穿一件花衣裳，一面说：社里过了春节就开办托儿所，这小鬼送到托儿所多好啊。夫妇俩兴奋地同记者畅谈了合作化的好处。
    春节的这两天，水上人家都互相团拜贺新春，远道的亲戚也划小艇来了。陆上的人也纷纷同水上人家互相团拜。
