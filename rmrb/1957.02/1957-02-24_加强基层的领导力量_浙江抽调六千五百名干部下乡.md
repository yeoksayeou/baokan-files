    Strengthening Leadership at the Grassroots Level
    Zhejiang Sends 6,500 Cadres to the Countryside
    (Our Hangzhou dispatch, February 20) As of the end of January, Zhejiang Province had dispatched 6,558 outstanding cadres to the countryside to strengthen leadership at the grassroots level.
    The majority of these cadres sent to work in the rural areas are familiar with rural work and have relatively rich experience in rural work. According to statistics, among the cadres dispatched, 300 are at the county committee level and 1,300 are at the district committee level. The Jiaxing Special District dispatched over 1,000 cadres in the first batch, ensuring that 84% of townships have county and district committee-level cadres serving as township general branch secretaries and township heads. Among these cadres are 59 individuals, including deputy county heads of the county people's committees, county committee ministers, deputy ministers, and office directors. Among the more than 2,600 cadres dispatched to the countryside in the Ningbo Special District, 93% are party members.
    Many cadres, after going to the countryside, have demonstrated a hardworking and simple style, earning the love and respect of the masses. Jin Shunxiang, a cadre dispatched by the Fuyang County Committee to work in Lishan Township, is relatively familiar with agricultural production but did not understand the paper industry production, which accounts for a significant portion of the farmers' sideline income. Therefore, he humbly learned from the commune members every day. Although he had to work until after 11 o'clock every night before going to bed, he still insisted on studying for two hours. The masses in the township reflected: "The county has sent such a good cadre to help us with production, and we must also help him do his job well." Yao Jiangxi, who was sent to Yongxin Township in Lanxi County as the general branch secretary, began working with the masses to carry river mud and cultivate fields as soon as he arrived in the township, establishing a high reputation among the masses and promoting the development of the manure accumulation movement throughout the township.

    加强基层的领导力量
    浙江抽调六千五百名干部下乡
    本报杭州20日电　截至1月底止，浙江省已经抽调六千五百五十八名优秀干部下乡，加强基层领导。
    这次到农村工作的干部，大部分熟悉农村工作，有着较丰富的农村工作经验。据统计，在下调的干部中，有县委级干部三百人，区委级干部一千三百人。嘉兴专区第一批抽调一千多干部下乡，使84％的乡都有县委和区委级干部担任乡总支书记和乡长。这些干部中有县人民委员会的副县长，县委部长、副部长和办公室主任等五十九人。宁波专区抽调下乡的二千六百多干部中，党员占93％。
    许多干部下乡后，发挥了艰苦朴素的作风，受到了群众的爱戴。中共富阳县委派到里山乡工作的干部金顺祥，对农业生产比较熟悉，但对占农民副业收入较大的纸业生产不懂，于是他天天虚心向社员学习，每晚虽然要工作到十一点多钟才回去睡觉，他仍要坚持两小时的学习。乡里的群众反映：“县里派了这样好干部来帮助我们生产，我们也要帮助他做好工作。”派到兰溪县永新乡担任总支书记的姚江西，一到乡里就和群众一起挑河泥、耕田，在群众中树立了很高威信，推动了全乡积肥运动的开展。
