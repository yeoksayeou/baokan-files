Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 27th. The first session of the new Polish Parliament resumed on the afternoon of the 26th.

After approving the Credentials Committee's report, the meeting heard a report from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Józef Cyrankiewicz, on the government's program.

Cyrankiewicz said that the government's main task is to implement the program of the National Unity Front, which was formulated based on the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party and, as demonstrated in the elections, is supported by the people of the whole country. This is a more sensible and realistic program for further building socialism. The 1957 national economic plan and the 1957 budget submitted by the government to this session will fully embody the government's action program.

Cyrankiewicz pointed out that the government's course of action in the past period was: to improve the planning and management institutions of the economy; to give play to the role of various economic components to increase commodity production; to increase agricultural production, promote exchange between urban and rural areas, and develop the agricultural cooperative movement. Within its economic capacity, the government has tried its best to adjust the wages of employees in certain sectors.

Speaking about the current economic situation in Poland, Cyrankiewicz pointed out that both industrial and agricultural production had increased considerably last year. The Soviet Union cancelled Poland's previous debts and granted Poland long-term loans. Without this assistance from the Soviet Union, the situation would have been very serious.

Cyrankiewicz pointed out that despite the achievements made last year, the economic situation in the new year remains difficult. Some of the problems left over from the past period have not yet been resolved. Further economic development in the future will depend on the strengthening of workers' initiative. Workers' committees should focus on improving the utilization of enterprise production capacity and fighting against waste. The government will reject the idea of ​​abolishing state planning agencies and allowing enterprises complete freedom.

Cyrankiewicz said that realistically setting tasks is one of the main characteristics of the 1957 plan. The tasks set for this year are: a 4% increase in industrial production, which is less than before, but through improved management and reduced waste, there is a greater possibility of overfulfilling the industrial production plan. National investment expenditure remains at last year's level. This is not due to reduced concern for industrialization, but due to material difficulties and the need to save some financial resources to increase wages, social welfare expenses, and farmers' income. The characteristics of the 1957 budget are: increasing social and cultural expenses, reducing military spending, streamlining administrative organs, and reducing land taxes and taxes on handicrafts and small-scale private industries.

Cyrankiewicz said that Poland's foreign trade still faces great difficulties, namely, insufficient foreign exchange reserves and reduced exports of coal and certain materials (coal exports decreased by 6.5 million tons compared with 1956). This year's import plan mainly ensures the import of industrial raw materials, improves the supply of chemical fertilizers and consumer goods. He said that the current negotiations with foreign countries for loans are not only to stabilize the balance of payments, but also to increase production more rapidly and accelerate the improvement of market commodity supply based on obtaining foreign raw materials.

Speaking about foreign policy, Cyrankiewicz said that the purpose of Polish foreign policy is to consolidate the country's independence and sovereignty, the inviolability of its borders, and the international foundation for the socialist development of its economy and culture. The main tasks of Polish foreign policy are: to consolidate peace, strengthen ties with socialist countries, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, and strengthen cooperative relations with countries fighting to consolidate the independence they have gained in the anti-colonialist struggle. Poland will continue to adhere to the principles of national equality and self-determination, and will fight for peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems, for disarmament, and for collective security.

Cyrankiewicz stated that Poland supports the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals put forward last November, supports China's proposal for the establishment of a collective peace treaty in the Asian and Pacific region, and supports the Soviet Union's recent proposal for peace and security in the Middle East.

Cyrankiewicz emphasized that under the circumstances that the policies of the imperialist bloc, especially their policies in West Germany, threaten Poland's security, strengthening Poland's internationalist unity with socialist camp countries, especially with the Soviet Union, is of fundamental importance. He emphasized the important significance of the Warsaw Pact for defending Poland's independence.

Cyrankiewicz said that our relations with socialist countries are fully in line with Leninist principles, which are fully embodied in the declarations of the Soviet and Chinese governments last year and in the Polish-Soviet and Polish-Chinese joint statements last year.

Relations between Poland and Yugoslavia have been normalized, and cooperation between the two countries is developing smoothly.

The Polish government is providing support to the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and believes that its program is correct.

Cyrankiewicz mentioned that Poland is anxiously watching the situation caused by imperialist policies: China has not yet obtained its legitimate seat in the United Nations, Taiwan has not yet returned to China's embrace, the unification of Korea is hindered, the Geneva Agreement on Vietnam is being undermined, Israeli troops have not yet withdrawn from Egyptian territory, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" constitutes a threat to the independence of Arab countries, creating the danger of new conflicts.

Cyrankiewicz then talked about the establishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and Japan, and pointed out that Poland will cooperate with more Asian countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Cyrankiewicz said that Poland is developing its network of diplomatic, consular, and commercial missions abroad. On October 6 last year, Poland made a proposal to the United States requesting negotiations to resolve contentious issues. He also said that Poland is conducting negotiations with France to promote the traditional friendship between the two countries. He also pointed out the improvement of Polish-British relations.

Cyrankiewicz said that in developing economic relations with capitalist countries, Poland is guided by its economic needs, while also recognizing the principles of equality and mutual benefit. On this basis, economic relations between Poland and Britain, France, and other countries have shown some vitality. Recently, Poland has begun talks with the United States.

Cyrankiewicz also put forward proposals at the meeting on reorganizing and merging some government departments. Finally, based on consultations among the various parties, he submitted a list of the new government to the parliament.

After hearing Cyrankiewicz's report, the plenary session of the parliament announced a recess until 5:00 p.m. on the 27th.

    波兰新议会第一次会议复会
    西伦凯维兹报告政府施政纲领
    新华社华沙27日电　波兰新议会第一次会议在26日下午复会。
    会议在通过了资格审查委员会的报告以后，听取了部长会议主席西伦凯维兹关于政府施政纲领的报告。
    西伦凯维兹说，政府的主要任务是实现全国统一阵线的纲领，这是根据波兰统一工人党八中全会决议制定的、并且在选举中证明为全国人民所拥护的纲领，这是更明智、更现实的进一步建设社会主义的纲领。政府向这次会议提出的1957年国民经济计划和1957年预算将全面地体现政府的行动纲领。
    西伦凯维兹指出，政府在过去一个时期的行动方针是：改进经济的计划和管理机构；发挥各种经济成分的作用，以增加商品生产；提高农业生产，促进城乡交流和发展农业合作化运动。政府在经济能力许可的范围内，尽力调整了某些部门职工的工资。
    西伦凯维兹在谈到波兰目前的经济状况时指出，去年工、农业生产都有了相当大的提高。苏联取消了以前波兰所负的债务，并且给予波兰长期贷款。如果没有苏联的这些援助，那么情况会是十分严重的。
    西伦凯维兹指出，尽管去年已经取得了成就，新的一年的经济状况仍然是困难的。过去一个时期留下的某些问题还没有得到解决。今后经济的进一步发展将依靠工人积极性的加强。工人委员会的注意力应当集中在提高利用企业生产能力和反对浪费的斗争上面。政府将拒绝那种取消国家计划机关和让企业完全自由的意见。
    西伦凯维兹说，实事求是地规定任务是1957年计划的主要特点之一。今年规定的任务是：工业生产增加4％，比以前增加得少些，但是通过改善管理和减少浪费，工业生产计划存在着超额完成的更大可能性。国家投资支出保持在去年的水平上。这并不是由于减少了对工业化的关心，而是由于物资方面的困难，以及必须保存一些财力来增加工资、社会福利费用和农民收入。1957年预算的特点是：增加社会和文化费用，削减军费，精简行政机构，减少土地税和手工业、小规模私营工业的税收。
    西伦凯维兹说，波兰的对外贸易还有着很大的困难，这就是外币储备不足，煤和某些物资的出口减少（煤的出口比1956年减少六百五十万吨）。今年进口计划主要是保证工业原料的进口、改善化学肥料和对居民消费品的供应。他说，目前同外国进行贷款的谈判不仅是为了稳定支付平衡，也是为了在得到外国原料的基础上更加迅速地提高生产，加速改善市场的商品供应。
    西伦凯维兹在谈到外交政策的时候说，波兰外交政策的目的在于使国家的独立和主权、边界的不可侵犯性以及经济和文化的社会主义发展的国际基础得到巩固。波兰外交政策的主要任务是：巩固和平，加强同社会主义国家的联系，加强社会主义阵营的团结，以及同为巩固在反殖民主义斗争中获得的独立而斗争的国家加强合作关系。波兰将继续坚持民族平等和自决的原则，并且为社会制度不同的国家的和平共处、为裁军和集体安全而斗争。
    西伦凯维兹表示，波兰支持苏联去年11月提出的关于裁军的建议，支持中国关于建立亚洲和太平洋地区集体和平公约的主张，支持苏联最近提出的关于中近东和平和安全的建议。
    西伦凯维兹强调指出，在帝国主义集团的政策特别是它们在西德的政策威胁着波兰的安全的情况下，加强波兰同社会主义阵营国家，首先是同苏联的国际主义团结，具有根本的重要性。他强调指出华沙条约对保卫波兰独立的重要意义。
    西伦凯维兹说，我们同社会主义各国的关系是完全符合列宁主义原则的，这些原则充分体现在苏联、中国政府去年的声明中和去年的波苏声明和波中联合声明当中。
    波兰和南斯拉夫的关系已经正常化，两国的合作正在顺利发展。
    波兰政府正在给予匈牙利工农革命政府以支持，并且认为它的纲领是正确的。
    西伦凯维兹提到，波兰不安地注视着帝国主义政策所造成的局面：中国还没有取得在联合国的合法地位，台湾还没有回到中国的怀抱，朝鲜的统一受到阻碍，关于越南问题的日内瓦协定遭到破坏，以色列军队还没有撤出埃及领土，“艾森豪威尔主义”构成对阿拉伯国家独立的威胁，产生了发生新冲突的危险。
    西伦凯维兹接着谈到波兰同日本建立外交关系，并且指出，波兰将根据和平共处五项原则同更多的亚洲国家进行合作。
    西伦凯维兹说，波兰正在发展它在国外的外交、领事和商务代表团网。去年10月6日，波兰向美国提出建议，要求举行谈判，以解决引起争端的问题。他又说，波兰正在同法国进行谈判，以促进两国之间的传统友谊。他还指出了波英关系的改善。
    西伦凯维兹说，在发展同资本主义国家的经济关系方面，波兰是以它的经济需要作为指针的，同时也承认权利平等和互利的原则。在这个基础上，波兰同英法和其他国家的经济关系已经有了一些生气。最近波兰已经开始同美国举行会谈。
    西伦凯维兹在会上还提出了关于改组和合并政府一些部门的建议。他最后根据各党派协商的结果，向议会提出了新政府名单。
    议会全体会议在听取了西伦凯维兹的报告以后，宣布休会到27日下午5时复会。
