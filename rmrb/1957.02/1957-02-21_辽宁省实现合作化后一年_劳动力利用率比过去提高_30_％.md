Liaoning Province One Year After Realizing Cooperativization
Labor Utilization Rate Increased by 30% Compared to the Past

    (Our dispatch) Liaoning Province, in the first year of realizing agricultural cooperativization, has increased its labor utilization rate by 20%-30% compared to the past. According to statistics, over 534,000 laborers are now participating in agricultural production across the province, an increase of 11.8% compared to the individual economy era. The attendance rate of cooperative members has also greatly improved. Male laborers participate in production for approximately 200 workdays per year, an increase of 33% compared to the past; female laborers have surged to over 100 workdays, an increase of 150% compared to the past. According to investigations by the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee Working Group, the attendance rate of able-bodied laborers in the "Longhua" Agricultural Cooperative in Gaiping County and the "Fuguo" Agricultural Cooperative in Fengcheng County reached over 250 days for men and 150 days for women, both meeting the standards stipulated in the Draft National Agricultural Development Program.

    The main reason for the increased labor utilization rate after advanced cooperativization is that cooperatives can break down boundaries, comprehensively arrange manpower, organize diverse production labor, and make the best use of talent. In particular, it has opened up broad avenues for semi-laborers and female laborers to participate in production. Taking farmland water conservancy projects as an example, last year, over 10,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province built over 12,000 small reservoirs and ponds, over 8,000 large and small irrigation projects, and also dug nearly 100,000 water wells, increasing the irrigated area of cultivated land in the province by over 3 million mu, an expansion of 150% compared to the past. As a result, the rice planting area has also increased from 1.2 million mu to 3 million mu. Agricultural cooperatives along rivers and in mountainous areas have constructed flood control, drainage, and water and soil conservation projects. Although the rainfall in Liaoning Province last year was relatively high and the flood season arrived early, many areas that previously suffered from floods in nine out of ten years still achieved a bumper harvest last year. Cooperative members said: "Relying on our own hands, we have turned the rivers that ruined our families for many years into rivers of happiness." (Zhao Lin)

    辽宁省实现合作化后一年
    劳动力利用率比过去提高30％
    本报讯　辽宁省在实现了农业合作化的头一年，劳动力利用率已经比过去提高了20％—30％。据统计，全省参加农业生产的劳动力已经达到五十三万四千多个，比个体经济时候增加了11.8％。社员的出勤率也大为提高，男劳动力全年参加生产约二百多个工作日，比过去增加33％；女劳动力突增到一百多个工作日，比过去提高了一倍半。据辽宁省委工作组调查：盖平县的“隆华”和凤城县的“富国”两个农业社，整劳动力的出勤率男的达到二百五十个以上，女的达到一百五十个，都合乎全国农业发展纲要草案所规定的标准。
    高级合作化后劳动力利用率提高的主要原因，是由于合作社可以打破界限，全面安排人力，组织多种生产劳动，做到人尽其才，特别是给半劳力和妇女劳力参加生产开辟了广阔道路，即以农田水利工程一项来看，去年，全省上万个农业社共修筑小型水库和塘坝一万二千多座，大小灌溉工程八千多处，还打了近十万眼水井，使全省耕地的灌溉面积增加三百多万亩，比过去扩大一倍半。因此，水稻种植面积也由一百二十万亩，增加到三百万亩。沿河和山区的农业社修建了防洪排涝及水土保持工程。辽宁省去年的降雨量虽然较大，汛期提前，但是，许多以前十年九涝的地区，去年仍然获得丰收，社员们说：“靠我们的双手，把多年的败家河，变成了幸福水”。　（赵麟）
