    The Life of the Soviet People
        A Good Hunting Season
    Severe cold blankets the land of Yakutia. It's the perfect season for hunting. Tens of thousands of hunters are active in the boundless snow-covered forests. Thousands of small houses for hunters can be seen on both banks of the Lena River, the Kolyma River, and other rivers. Some hunters live here with their families. Igor, from the "Communist" collective farm in the Ordzhonikidze district, and his wife live in this small house. They have been hunting for more than thirty years. Two of their eight children have also become hunters, and now they hunt chipmunks together in the great forest.
    The Yakutsk region is rich in silver sable, sable, and fox furs, and its fur products are world-renowned.
    On this freezing morning, at the break of dawn, Yushmanov and his team set off. At this time, it was snowing heavily, and the snow in the forest was half a person deep. The spacious sleigh carried the hunters swiftly across the snow. That day, Yushmanov returned fully loaded, having hunted seventeen chipmunks and ten silver sable.
      Ice Fishing
    The Soviet people are always full of optimism and enthusiasm. They have a wide range of interests and can find various ways to entertain themselves in their spare time or on holidays.
    In these icy and snowy days, on many frozen rivers in the Soviet Union, you can see people, scattered here and there, sitting motionless on small stools on the ice. What are they doing? It turns out they are fishing by drilling holes in the ice. Especially on holidays, some people bring bread, cigarettes, and alcohol, and sit on the ice from morning till night, enjoying the endless fun of fishing in ice holes.
    Look at this photo: This is steelworker Lakhno taking a fish he just caught out of the ice hole. (Fang Xuan)

    苏联人民生活
        打猎的好季节
    严寒笼罩着雅库特的大地。正是打猎的好季节。在无边的雪复盖的大森林里，有上万的猎人在活动。在勒拿河、科雷玛河等河的两岸可以看见数千所猎人住的小房子。有些猎人全家都住在这里。奥尔忠尼启则区“共产党人”集体农庄的伊果尔和他的妻子就住在这小房子里。他们从事打猎已经三十多年了。他们的八个孩子中有两个也成了猎人，现在他们一起在大森林里打灰鼠。
    雅库特边疆区盛产银鼠皮、黑貂皮和狐狸皮，这里的皮货世界闻名。
    在这天寒地冻的一个清晨，天蒙蒙亮的时候，尤什曼诺夫同他的小队就出发了。这时，正是大雪纷飞，大森林里积雪有半人深。宽敞的雪橇载着猎人在雪地上灵便地奔驰。这一天，尤什曼诺夫满载而归，他打了十七只灰鼠，十只银鼠。
      凿冰垂钓
    苏维埃人总是充满了乐观、饱满的情绪。他们的兴趣很广，在工作之余或假日里，都能为自己找到各种方式的娱乐。
    在这冰天雪地的日子里，在苏联许多封冻的河上，都可以看到一些人，东一个，西一个，一动不动地坐在冰上的一张小凳子上。他们在作什么？原来他们把冰凿个洞在钓鱼。特别是在假日的时候，有些人带着面包和烟酒，从早到晚坐在冰上，享受在冰窟中钓鱼的无穷乐趣。
    请看这张照片：这是炼钢工人拉赫诺正在把刚刚钓到的一条鱼从冰窟中取上来。　　　（方萱）
