Recently, I visited the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Yichun County, Jiangxi Province. The cooperative's total grain output last year more than doubled compared to the bumper year of 1955, and sideline income increased more than twenty-four times. All members of the cooperative increased their income, with the highest increasing tenfold and the lowest increasing by 40%. The average income per person in the cooperative was 124 yuan.

When discussing last year's bumper harvest, the members of the cooperative always mention the reservoirs in front and behind the village. Before liberation, this place was known as a place where "toads die of dryness and rats die of starvation," and drought occurred if it didn't rain for three days. In the winter of 1955, advanced agricultural cooperativization was realized here, and the farmers vigorously built water conservancy projects, constructing three new reservoirs and five ponds, and repairing the five reservoirs and four ponds that had been built in the previous two years. Therefore, although they suffered the longest drought in history last year, they still achieved a good harvest.

The cooperative is also able to "make the best use of talent" in the use of labor. Huang Linhua, a young blind man, could only sit and eat in the past. Last year, the cooperative arranged for him to chop sweet potato roots for pig feed, earning five and a half points per workday, and he received more than 120 yuan at the end-of-year settlement. There was also a cooperative member who could not straighten his back due to illness. The cooperative also arranged appropriate work for him. Last year, he received more than 2,000 catties of grain, more than 20 catties of oil, as well as wheat and sweet potatoes, and no longer had to worry about food and clothing.

With the increase in income, the lives of the members have naturally improved. In 1955, the farmers in this cooperative only bought 31 new cotton quilts, but last year they bought 293. In 1955, they only made 61 new cotton-padded jackets, but last year they made 185. Many cooperative members' families had painted large floral beds, tables, wardrobes, and enamel washbasins for the first time. Zou Fachang, a cooperative member who was very poor in 1955, now has a new cotton quilt, new clothes, and made more than 70 catties of cured meat for the Spring Festival, and still has two large pigs weighing more than 100 catties in the pen.

The fact that 100% of the members increased their income has encouraged the members' enthusiasm for labor and running the cooperative. On January 7, the cooperative launched a campaign to propose rationalization suggestions, and the members put forward 110 suggestions in two days. Yuan Yanxiang, an elderly cooperative member who used to not care about things, also put forward rationalization suggestions. The preparations for spring plowing and production were done very well. The construction project of the ninth reservoir, which was originally scheduled to be completed in half a month with 6,500 workdays, was completed in ten days with only 4,500 workdays. The planting area of rapeseed and green manure crops increased by one-third compared to 1955. The winter plowing fields that should be plowed have been completed one month ahead of schedule. Although the amount of fertilizer accumulated is lower than in 1955, the quality has been improved.

Last year's bumper harvest enriched the members' experience in increasing production. A few days ago, the cooperative discussed this year's production plan from the bottom up. The members used the method of ranking fields one by one, comparing upper fields with lower fields, and comparing lean fields with fertile fields to set this year's yield targets. Last year, 17 mu of land in this cooperative had a yield of 1,800 catties per mu. About one-half of the fields in the cooperative have similar soil quality and sunlight conditions to these 17 mu, and the yield last year was 1,100 catties. The members believe that it is no problem to increase the yield by another 200 catties per mu. About one-quarter of the fields in the cooperative are considered to be relatively lean, and the yield last year was 600 catties. The members believe that as long as they apply more fertilizer, apply it evenly, pay attention to weeding and pulling grass, and master the planting and weeding time, it is entirely possible to increase the yield. After such careful research, they determined that this year's grain output should increase by 33.4% compared to last year. The members said that this plan is entirely possible to achieve because the results of water conservancy construction over the years can ensure that the rice seedlings will not die of drought even if it does not rain for 50 to 60 days.

    百分之百的社员增加收入的五星农业社
    新华社记者　彭江流
    最近，记者访问了江西省宜春县五星农业社。这个社去年粮食总产量比丰收的1955年增加一倍多；副业收入增加二十四倍多。全部社员增加了收入，最多的增加十倍，最少的也增加40％。全社平均每口人收入一百二十四元。
    这个社的社员们在谈论去年的丰收时，总爱提到村前村后的水库。解放前，这里被人称为“干死蛤蟆，饿死老鼠”的地方，三天不下雨就出现旱情。1955年冬这里实现了高级农业合作化，农民们大力兴修水利，新建了三座水库、五口水塘，修补了前两年修的五座水库、四口水塘。因此，去年虽然遭受了历史上时间最久的旱灾，仍然获得了好年景。
    这个社在使用劳动力方面，也能够“人尽其才”。社员黄林华，是一个青年瞎子，过去只能坐着吃饭；去年社里安排他切红薯根子等作猪饲料，每个工作日五分半，年终决算时分得了一百二十多元。还有一个因为有病不能直腰的社员，社里也给他安排了适当的活计，去年他共分得两千多斤谷子，二十多斤油，还有麦子、蕃薯，不再愁穿愁吃了。
    社员收入增加，生活自然改善。1955年这个社的农民们只买进新棉絮三十一床，去年买进二百九十三床；1955年只做新棉袄六十一件，去年做了一百八十五件；许多社员家里第一次有了油漆大花床、条桌、衣柜、洋瓷脸盆。1955年还很贫困的社员邹发昌，现在一家三口，棉絮是新的，衣服是新的，这次过春节还做了七十多斤腊肉，栏里还留着两只一百多斤重的大猪。
    百分之百社员增加收入的事实，鼓舞着社员们劳动和办社的热情。1月7日，社里发动提合理化建议，在两天中社员们就提出一百一十条，过去是不问事的老年社员袁燕祥，也提出了合理化建议。春耕生产准备工作做得很好，第九个水库的修建工程，原定在半个月内用六千五百个工修好，结果在十天中只用四千五百个工就修好了；油菜、绿肥作物比1955年增种了三分之一；应耕的冬耕田已经提前一月耕完；积肥数量虽比1955年低些，但是质量却提高了。
    去年的丰收，丰富了社员的增产经验。前几天，社里自下而上的讨论了今年的生产计划。社员们通过逐丘排队、上丘比下丘、瘦田比肥田的办法来订今年的产量指标。这个社，去年曾有十七亩田每亩产量达到一千八百斤；全社约有二分之一的田和这十七亩田的土质以及日照条件差不多，去年产量是一千一百斤，社员们认为每亩再增产二百斤是没有问题的。全社还有约四分之一被认为是较瘦的田，去年产量是六百斤，社员们认为只要多施肥料、施得均匀、注意耘禾扯草，掌握栽耘时间，产量是完全有可能提高的。他们经过这样细致的研究，确定今年粮食产量要比去年增产33.4％。社员们说，这个计划是完全有可能实现的，因为历年兴修水利的结果，已能保证五十天至六十天不下雨也不会旱死禾苗。
