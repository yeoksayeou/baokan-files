Let Everyone Get Along More Harmoniously
　　Zhang Shihong

　　Since a large number of cadres have been sent to the countryside, the front lines of the agricultural front have been greatly strengthened, and all kinds of work are being taken care of. There is no doubt that a new atmosphere will emerge in rural work in the future.

　　The cadres who were originally in the countryside welcome the cadres sent down from above, as they need the support of fresh troops. The cadres who are transferred to the countryside are also willing to truly play their role and make achievements in their new positions. However, since it has not been long since the cadres were sent down, the understanding between the cadres sent down and the cadres originally in the countryside is not sufficient, and some inconsistencies in the work are inevitable. This requires both parties to actively seek closeness and consistency, and eliminate possible misunderstandings and estrangement.

　　At present, in some places, the cadres sent down and the cadres originally in the countryside do not get along harmoniously enough. Although this phenomenon is still only a small sprout, it should be paid attention to so that it can be cleared away in the bud. The cadres sent down have a strong sense of responsibility and hope to make more achievements, which is a good wish. However, some people are therefore a little impatient, not patient enough to listen to the opinions of the original cadres in the countryside in their work, and do not cooperate well with them. A few people even have a sense of superiority and look down on the original cadres in the countryside. For example, some cadres sent to the countryside in Leiyang County, Hunan Province, believe that they are district-level cadres and can disobey the leadership of the township general branch; instead of adopting a patient and helping attitude towards the shortcomings of the comrades in the township, they adopted a blaming attitude, which of course will affect mutual unity. On the side of the original township cadres, some people also have some feelings of gain and loss, fearing that the cadres sent to the countryside will weaken their status and prestige. Therefore, they do not cooperate enough in the work of the cadres sent to the countryside, and do not care enough about their lives. A cadre in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, was sent to work in Tanghui Township. On the same day, the secretary of the party general branch raised many questions for him to answer, and said behind his back: "I am weighing him. If his weight is not enough, I will not listen to him." Obviously, this attitude is also not good.

　　At present, the task of rural work is arduous, various complex problems within the cooperatives need to be solved urgently, and spring ploughing preparations need to be carried out urgently. Everyone should work together to overcome various difficulties and solve various problems. The cadres sent to the countryside are not very familiar with the local situation, and they should rely on the original township cadres in their work, listen to their opinions more, and at the same time give them practical help. In strengthening the mutual assistance and unity between the two sides, the cadres sent to the countryside should do more work. The cadres originally in the township should vigorously support this group of fresh troops from above, let them become familiar with the situation as soon as possible, and at the same time be good at learning from their strengths and improving their own working methods. The county and township party organizations should pay special attention to the issue of cadre relations, criticize all thoughts and actions that are not conducive to unity, eliminate possible misunderstandings and estrangement, and let everyone get along more harmoniously and fight together for this year's bumper harvest in agriculture.

    让大家相处得更融洽些
    章世鸿
    大批干部下放到农村以后，农业战线的前哨阵地大大加强了，各种工作都有人管了。毫无疑问，今后农村工作会出现新的气象。
    原来在乡下的干部是欢迎上面的干部下放的，他们需要生力军的支持；而被抽调下乡的干部也都愿意真正发挥自己的作用，在新的岗位上作出成绩来。但因为下放不久，下去的干部和原在乡下的干部相互了解还不够，工作中有些不一致的地方是很难免的。这需要双方主动地去求得接近和一致，消除可能引起的误解和隔阂。
    目前有些地方，下去的干部和原来在乡下的干部相处不够融洽，这种现象虽还只是小小的萌芽，但应该注意它，以便在萌芽状态就动手来清除它。下去的干部有强烈的责任感，希望能多做出些成绩来，这种愿望是好的。但有些人因此有些急躁，在工作中耐心地听取原在乡下的干部的意见不够，和他们合作得不够好；少数人甚至有优越感，看不起原在乡下的干部。例如，湖南耒阳县有一些下乡干部，认为自己是区级干部，可以不服从乡总支的领导；对乡里的同志的缺点，不是采取耐心帮助的态度，而采取了指斥的态度，这当然会影响相互之间的团结。在原来的乡干部方面，也有些人产生一些患得患失的情绪，生怕下乡干部会削弱自己的地位和威信，因此，对下乡干部工作上合作不够，生活上关心不够。浙江嘉兴县一个干部派到塘汇乡去工作，当天党总支书记就提出很多问题要他解答，背后对人说：“我是秤秤他，如果他的斤两不足，我就不听他。”显然，这种态度也是不好的。
    目前，农村工作的任务是艰巨的，合作社内各种复杂的问题亟需解决，春耕准备工作亟需进行，大家应该同心协力，克服各种困难，解决各种问题。下乡干部对当地情况不很熟，工作中应该依靠原来的乡干部，多听取他们的意见，同时给予他们切实的帮助。在加强双方的互助团结方面，下乡的干部应多做些工作。原来在乡里的干部则应大力支持这批来自上面的生力军，尽快地让他们熟悉情况，同时要善于向他们的长处学习，改进自己的工作方法。县和乡的党组织特别要关心干部的关系问题，批评一切不利于团结的思想和行动，消除可能引起的误解和隔阂，让大家相处得更融洽些，共同为今年的农业大丰收而斗争。
