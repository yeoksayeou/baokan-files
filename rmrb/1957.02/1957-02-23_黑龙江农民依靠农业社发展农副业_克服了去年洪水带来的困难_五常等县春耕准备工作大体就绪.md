　　This Newspaper News—The difficulties brought to the production and life of the people along the river in Heilongjiang Province by the largest flood on record last year have been basically overcome by the province's farmers who have already realized cooperation. At present, except for the severely affected cooperatives where production and life still have certain difficulties and require some assistance from the state, the production and life of the generally affected cooperatives have been guaranteed.

　　After the flood occurred, agricultural cooperatives in various regions, under the slogan of "Save one mu if we can, harvest one stalk if we can," actively carried out farmland rescue work. Anda County organized nearly 20,000 people to dig drainage ditches, rescuing more than 7,700 hectares of farmland and harvesting more than 2 million jin of grain. Wuchang County dug 240,000 meters of drainage trenches in half a month, draining accumulated water from more than 5,000 hectares, enabling the affected farmland to still yield 40% of the harvest. At this time, many regions also seized the opportunity to replant late autumn crops. In four or five days, Pingxiang Township in Tailai County replanted 150 hectares of buckwheat, 45 hectares of cabbage, and transplanted rice seedlings on 6 hectares; these crops all yielded good harvests. The masses reflected, "Without agricultural cooperatives, it would have been impossible to rescue so many crops."

　　All disaster areas in the province also vigorously mobilized disaster victims to develop sideline production. According to incomplete statistics from 38 counties, by the end of last year, the province's sideline income had reached more than 2.9 million yuan. This income can compensate for about 40% of the losses caused by the disaster and can also solve the problem of food for one million disaster victims for a year. It is estimated that by the end of March this year, the sideline income in the disaster areas of the province can basically compensate for the significant losses to people's property caused by the flood. At present, there are more than 100 types of sideline industries, and about 90% of the labor force in the disaster areas of the province has been invested in various productions.

　　While carrying out production for self-relief, all disaster areas actively prepared for spring ploughing production. According to understanding of seven counties including Wuchang, Shuangcheng, Bin County, Mingshui, and Baiquan, spring ploughing production preparations have been largely completed. In many disaster areas of Shuangcheng County, while threshing and delivering grain, they began to carry out spring ploughing preparations such as delivering manure, replenishing farm implements, and buying horses. The county's 54 disaster-stricken cooperatives have delivered manure to 1,600 hectares, accounting for 58% of the cultivated area; more than 50 horses have been purchased. More than 1,500 tons of seeds have been stored; positive measures are being taken to solve the problem of horse fodder. These facts of production and disaster relief fully demonstrate the great superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. (Sun Yushan, et al.)

    黑龙江农民依靠农业社发展农副业
    克服了去年洪水带来的困难
    五常等县春耕准备工作大体就绪
    本报讯　去年黑龙江省发生的有记载以来的最大一次洪水给沿江人民生产和生活所带来的困难，基本上被已经实现了合作化的全省农民克服了。现在，除重灾社生产和生活尚有一定的困难，需要国家稍加扶助以外，一般受灾社的生产和生活都已经有了保证。
    水灾发生后，各地农业社在“救一亩是一亩，收一棵是一棵”的口号下，积极地进行了农田抢救工作。安达县组织了近两万人挖掘排水沟，抢救出农田七千七百多垧，收获粮食二百多万斤。五常县在半月内挖出排水壕长达二十四万公尺，排出积水五千多垧，使受灾农田还得到四成收获。在这个时候，许多地区还抓紧补种晚秋作物。泰来县平详乡四、五天工夫，补种了一百五十垧荞麦，四十五垧白菜，插稻秧六垧；这些作物收成都良好。群众反映：“没有合作社，要想抢救出这么多庄稼是不可能的”。
    全省各灾区还大力发动灾民开展了副业生产。据三十八个县的不完全统计，到去年年底，全省的副业收入已达二千九百多元。这些收入可以弥补灾害损失40％左右，也可以解决一百万灾民的一年吃粮问题。预计到今年3月底，全省灾区副业收入基本上可以弥补水灾给人民财产带来的重大损失。目前，副业门路已达一百余种，全省灾区的劳动力约有90％投入了各种生产。
    在开展生产自救的同时，各灾区积极地准备了春耕生产。据对五常、双城、宾县、明水、拜泉等七个县的了解，春耕生产准备工作已大体就绪。双城县许多灾区在打场和送粮的同时，就开始进行送粪、添补农具、买马等春耕准备工作。全县五十四个受灾社，已送粪一千六百垧，占耕地面积58％；已买马五十余匹。贮备了种籽一千五百多吨；马草问题正在采取积极措施解决。这些生产救灾的事实，充分证明了农业生产合作社有巨大优越性。　（孙玉山等）
