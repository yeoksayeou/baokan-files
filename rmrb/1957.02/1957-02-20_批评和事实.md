    Criticism and Facts
    Dai Bufan
    The first issue of "Opera Research" contains an article by Comrade Lin Hanbiao entitled "On the Western Chamber and Its Adaptations." When discussing the ending of the Western Chamber, Comrade Hanbiao said: Wang Shifu here "uses a romantic approach to write about the complete victory of young men and women in feudal times striving for freedom of marriage, and he encourages young men and women to persevere in their struggle with optimism. The reunion in the Western Chamber is meaningful... Some comrades believe that Wang Shifu 'ultimately had to arrange for Zhang Sheng to become a top scholar to solve the problem,' and believe that this is the 'backward part' of the Western Chamber. Such criticism is very unfair." – The original text has a note under the four words "backward part": "See Dai Bufan's 'Review of the Adaptation Work of the Yue Opera 'Western Chamber''." (Note: This article was published in the People's Daily in 1952 and later included in my book "Hundred Flowers Collection." The words in "single quotes" in Comrade Hanbiao's article above can be found on page 69 of "Hundred Flowers Collection.") The note also says: "Many people hold similar views," and then cites Xu Shuofang's view: "The reason its ending is unsatisfactory is that it is not realistic." It also cites Zhang Jiangdong's view: "This is an alteration by the feudal ruling class, a 'reunion' of compromise."
    After reading Comrade Hanbiao's article, I hurriedly flipped through my own article to check it. To explain the problem, I have to quote the original text here again:
    Wang Shifu wrote "Western Chamber" and allowed Zhang Sheng and Yingying to finally reunite, and the old lady finally failed, which showed his humanism and optimism, which is very valuable. However, due to historical limitations, Wang Shifu, who condemned the evils of family status and the imperial examination system, ultimately had to arrange for Zhang Sheng to become a top scholar to solve the problem; on this point, Wang Shifu is self-contradictory. Today, when we adapt "Western Chamber," while accepting the humanism and optimism of the original work, there is no need to preserve some of the backward parts of the original work intact. Changing the ending of the "Western Chamber" to a happy ending is necessary on today's stage. (Emphasis is newly added.)
    Comparing this passage with Comrade Hanbiao's opinion, it will not be difficult to find that the point of disagreement between us is: Hanbiao completely affirms the positive significance of the ending of the Western Chamber; while I believe that the ending of the Western Chamber has both a progressive and positive side, and a backward side limited by the times. My advocacy of deleting the happy ending is obviously not because this ending is completely "unrealistic" or a "compromise 'reunion'." My views are not completely the same as those of Shuofang and Jiangdong.
    Whether the views of Hanbiao, Comrade Shuofang, and myself mentioned above are consistent with the facts remains to be corrected by readers and experts. At the same time, I do not want to talk about my views on this issue in a long article "On Yingying" that I recently wrote. Here, I want to talk about this: If you only look at Comrade Hanbiao's article and footnotes, it is easy to make people think that I completely negate the fifth act of the Western Chamber. However, the "complete victory" and "optimistic spirit" mentioned in Comrade Hanbiao's article were also mentioned in my article. However, he omitted it, which is puzzling. At the same time, in the footnote, he spent a lot of space to introduce and criticize the opinions of Comrade Xu Shuofang and others who held "similar" views to me, but only selected individual words and phrases such as "backward part" to summarize my original opinion, which is even more puzzling. Comrade Hanbiao wanted to prove that my criticism of the Western Chamber was "very unfair." Why didn't he criticize based on the original text, but insisted on saying that the original text was like Comrade Shuofang's opinion?
    Because I have encountered similar situations more than once. I would like to bring it up here through this matter. I think: If criticism is to be kind and help others make progress, then it is necessary to understand the other party's views first. If only take the other party's fragmentary remarks and criticize them, the criticized person can humbly accept them, but the critic inevitably has the suspicion of quoting out of context. I also feel that: As an editor of a newspaper, he should trust the facts and materials provided by the author in the article; but in order to be more responsible to the readers, it is often necessary to check these facts and materials. For example: If the editor of "Opera Research" can check my original text, he will definitely find that there are "differences"; if these opinions are provided to Comrade Hanbiao and let him criticize my view of the ending of the Western Chamber: "It is both progressive and backward"; wouldn't it be possible to go deeper into the issue than criticizing the view that the ending of the Western Chamber is only a "backward part"?
    Simplifying the other party's opinion and saying that it is what one imagines is not enough to convince people, and it does not help to conduct in-depth discussions on the issue. It is not a serious attitude of "contention" – because I often criticize others, and I am also an editor. This is written as a self-encouragement for the new year.

    批评和事实
    戴不凡
    “戏曲研究”第一期载有林涵表同志“论西厢记及其改编”一文。在谈到西厢记结尾的时候，涵表同志说：王实甫在这里是“以浪漫主义的手法写出封建时代青年男女争取婚姻自由的彻底胜利，他以乐观精神鼓舞着青年男女坚韧不屈的斗争。西厢记的团圆是有意义的，……有的同志认为王实甫‘最后还不得不安排张生中状元来解决问题’，并认为这是西厢记的‘落后部分’，这样的批评是很不公允的。”——原文在“落后部分”四字下有个注：“见戴不凡‘评越剧“西厢记”的改编工作’”。（按：这篇文章于1952年发表于人民日报，后来收入拙著“百花集”中。上引涵表同志文中两个“单引号”中的话，见“百花集”69页）注中并说：“持有类似见解的人很多”，接着，就引证了徐朔方的看法：“它结尾之所以不能令人满意，就是因为它不真实。”又引证了张江东的看法：“这是封建统治阶级的窜改，是妥协的‘团圆’”。
    看了涵表同志的文章，我急忙翻出自己的文章来检查。为了说明问题，我只得把原文在这里再引一下：
    王实甫写“西厢记”让张生和莺莺终于团圆，老夫人终于失败，表现了他的人道主义和乐观主义精神，这是很可贵的。可是，由于受历史条件的限制，控诉了门第、科举制度罪恶的王实甫，最后还不得不安排张生中状元来解决问题；在这一点上，王实甫是自相矛盾的。今天我们改编“西厢记”，在接受原著人道主义和乐观主义精神的同时，是没有必要把原著中某些落后的部分也原封不动地保留下来的。把“西厢记”大团圆的结尾改一下，在今天舞台上是有必要的。（重点是新加的。）
    把这段文字和涵表同志的意见对照一下，将不难发现，我们意见分歧之处是：涵表完全肯定西厢记结尾部分的积极意义；而我则认为，西厢记的结尾既有进步的、积极的一面，又有受时代限制的、落后的一面。我主张删去大团圆，显然不是由于这个结尾是彻底的“不真实”，或是“妥协的‘团圆’”。和朔方、江东的见解并不完全一样。
    涵表、朔方同志以及我上述看法的本身，是否合乎事实，都有待读者和专家指正。同时，我也不想谈自己新近写成的一篇长文“论莺莺”中对这问题的看法。这里，我想谈的是：如果只看涵表同志的文章和附注，那么，很容易使人认为，我是彻底否定西厢记的第五本的。可是，涵表同志文中所提到的“彻底胜利”、“乐观精神”，在拙文中也是涉及过的。然而他却略而不谈，这就令人难解了。同时，他在附注中不惜篇幅详细介绍和批判见解和我“类似”的徐朔方等同志的意见，但是对我原来的意见却只选取了“落后部分”等个别字句来概括，这是益为令人费解了。涵表同志要证明我对西厢记的批评“是很不公允的”，为什么不根据原文来批评，而一定要把原文说成像朔方同志的意见那样呢？
    因为相似的情形，我已碰到不止一次。这里特借这件事提出来。我觉得：假如批评是与人为善，帮助别人进步的话，那么，首先就有必要看清对方的看法。如果只选取对方的片言只语，就加以批评，被批评者虽可虚心接受，但批评者却难免有断章取义之嫌了。我又觉得：作为一个报刊的编辑，他应当信任作者在文章中所提供的事实、材料；但为了更好地对读者负责，他往往有必要去查对这些事实和材料。譬如说：“戏曲研究”的编辑同志，如果能查一查我的原文，一定会发现“有所出入”的地方；如果把这些意见提供给涵表同志，让他来批判我对西厢记结尾的这种看法：“它既进步，但又落后”；那岂不是比批判那种一味认为西厢记的结尾是“落后部分”的看法，更可以把问题深入一步了么？
    把对方的意见简单化，说成像自己设想的那样，既不足以服人，更无裨深入研讨问题，不是一种严肃的“争鸣”态度，——由于自己也常批评别人，自己也是个编辑。新正试笔，特书此自勉。
