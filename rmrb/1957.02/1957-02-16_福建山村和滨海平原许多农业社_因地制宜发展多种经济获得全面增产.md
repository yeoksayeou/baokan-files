Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 15th—In the first year of agricultural cooperativization in Fujian Province, a number of agricultural production cooperatives have emerged in remote mountain villages and coastal plains that have developed diversified economies and achieved overall production increases.

　　Last year, the Liyang Agricultural Cooperative in Nanjing County, based on the local natural conditions, formulated a comprehensive production development plan in accordance with local conditions. They organized members to participate in various productions based on their physical strength and different technical expertise. As a result, the average yield of double-cropping rice reached 1,042 jin per mu, an increase of 55% compared to 1955; sweet potatoes, wheat, jute, tangerines, bananas, mangoes, etc. increased by 10% to 50%; in addition, a large number of poultry and livestock were bred. The total net income of this agricultural cooperative last year reached 115,000 yuan, with an average of 1.9 yuan per labor day. The income of all 172 cooperative members increased, with the most increase being 1,258 yuan.

　　After the Jianjia Agricultural Cooperative in Shunchang County, northern Fujian mountainous area, became an advanced cooperative last year, it opened up many production avenues and formed many specialized production teams and groups by category. When arranging production, the cooperative cadres also sought the opinions of the members on everything, and properly solved the problems of labor quota management and labor remuneration for various different productions. Therefore, the members' enthusiasm for labor was very high. Last year, the total grain production of the cooperative increased by more than 20%; economic crops and 13 kinds of handicraft sideline productions such as bricks, tiles, bamboo ware, and papermaking have been developed, and many pigs, dairy cows, goats, chickens, ducks, etc. were raised. The total income of the cooperative and the income of the members have increased significantly. Now, every member of this cooperative has no worries about food and clothing, and the cooperative has also taken out a part of the public welfare fund to run welfare undertakings such as medical clinics, nurseries, and clubs for the members.

　　The Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Haicheng County, which saw a significant increase in rice production last year, accumulated a large amount of fertilizer last year due to the development of animal husbandry production, and also made its own granular fertilizer and promoted rice straw returning to the fields, reducing the use of commercial fertilizers, thereby saving a lot of expenses. This cooperative also raised more than 30,000 freshwater fish and planted fruit trees in the hillside area. Last year, the total income of the cooperative reached more than one million yuan, becoming a "millionaire" agricultural cooperative in Fujian Province.

    福建山村和滨海平原许多农业社
    因地制宜发展多种经济获得全面增产
    新华社福州15日电　福建省农村实现合作化第一年中，在偏僻山村和滨海平原，都出现一批发展多种经济获得全面增产的农业生产合作社。
    南靖县历阳农业社去年根据当地自然条件，因地制宜地制定全面发展生产的计划，并且根据社员劳力强弱和不同的技术专长，组织他们参加各项生产。结果去年双季稻平均每亩产量达到一千零四十二斤，比1955年增加五成半；甘薯、小麦、黄麻、柑桔、香蕉、芒果等增产一成到五成；此外，还大量繁殖了家禽家畜等。这个农业社去年全年纯收入达到十一万五千元，平均每个劳动日分到一点九元，全社一百七十二户社员户户增加收入，最多一户增加收入一千二百五十八元。
    闽北山区顺昌县建铗农业社去年建成高级社以后，增辟了许多生产门路，分门别类地组成许多专业生产队和组。社干部在安排生产时，还事事征求社员意见，妥善地解决了劳动定额管理和各项不同生产的劳动报酬等问题。因此，社员劳动情绪很高。去年全社粮食增产二成多；经济作物和砖瓦、篾器、造纸等十三种手工业副业生产都有发展，并且养了许多猪和奶牛、山羊、鸡鸭等，全社总收入和社员收入都有显著增加。现在，这个社每户社员都吃穿不愁，社里还拿出一部分公益金为社员举办了医疗所、托儿所、俱乐部等福利事业。
    去年，水稻增产显著的海澄县黎明农业社，去年由于发展畜牧业生产增积大量肥料，并且自制颗粒肥料和推广稻秆回田，减少使用商品肥料，因而节省了大量开支。这个社去年还放养了三万多尾淡水鱼，在山坡地带种植果树。去年全社总收入达到一百万元以上，成为福建省的“百万富翁”农业社。
