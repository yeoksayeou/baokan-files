Xinhua News Agency, 5th: According to statistics from the China Highway Transport Trade Union, over 94,000 kilometers of highways nationwide were passable in both sunny and rainy weather last year, an increase of over 8,000 kilometers compared to 1955. This is the result of socialist competition among highway maintenance workers.

Highway maintenance workers, recognizing the large number of dirt roads and low road quality in our country, vigorously carried out work to improve dirt roads and add wear-resistant and protective layers last year. According to preliminary statistics, over 11,000 kilometers of dirt roads were improved nationwide last year, a fourfold increase compared to 1955. In some areas, such as Shandong, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia, the dirt roads improved in one year were equivalent to 30% to 50% of the total highways in the province or autonomous region. The vast majority of improved and hardened dirt roads are now passable in both sunny and rainy weather, changing the past situation of muddy conditions during rainy days and dusty conditions during sunny days. In some southern regions, the experience of laying wear-resistant and protective layers has been widely promoted, improving the quality of stone road surfaces. This experience, which was only promoted in Zhejiang, Fujian, and other regions before 1955, has now been popularized nationwide. According to statistics from twenty-four provinces and autonomous regions, over 16,000 kilometers of highways had wear-resistant and protective layers added last year, equivalent to 27% of the nation's clay-bound macadam roads. Adding a wear-resistant layer not only reduces major and medium repairs of highways and saves road maintenance costs, but also makes the road surface smooth and unobstructed, eliminating potholes.

The active efforts of highway maintenance workers to improve dirt roads and improve road surface quality have brought great benefits to automobile transportation and provided favorable conditions for tapping transportation potential. Preliminary calculations show that wherever road conditions were improved last year, the average speed of vehicles increased by an average of five to ten kilometers per hour, equivalent to increasing the transportation capacity of two thousand vehicles.

The improvement of highways not only accelerates the turnover of vehicles but also directly helps to save gasoline, extend tire mileage, and reduce mechanical wear. In the past, the automobiles of the Weinan Transportation Company in Shaanxi Province consumed 25 liters of gasoline per 100 kilometers when traveling on highways maintained by the Weinan road maintenance section. After the road surface was improved, the same brand of car, still traveling on the original route, reduced gasoline consumption to about 20 liters. After a highway in Jiangsu Province had a protective layer added, the average tire mileage increased from 42,681 kilometers to 61,487 kilometers.

In the work of improving dirt roads and repairing road surfaces, road maintenance workers have implemented the principle of using local materials, actively searching for natural material sites, and utilizing local materials, thereby saving a lot of expenses. The more than 10,000 kilometers of dirt roads improved last year saved the country approximately 90 million yuan.

### 全国养路职工积极提高公路质量  去年改善土路一万多公里，为国家节约九千万元

    全国养路职工积极提高公路质量
    去年改善土路一万多公里，为国家节约九千万元
    新华社5日讯　据中国公路运输工会统计，去年全国能晴雨通车的公路有九万四千多公里，比1955年增加八千多公里。这是公路养护职工开展社会主义竞赛的结果。
    公路养护职工根据我国土路多、路面质量低的情况，去年大力开展了改善土路，加铺磨耗层和保护层的工作。据初步统计，去年全国改善土路一万一千多公里，比1955年增加四倍。有的地区如山东、山西、内蒙古等地区，在一年内改善的土路相当于全省或全自治区公路的30％到50％。凡是经过改善、硬化了的土路，绝大部分能作到晴雨通车，改变了过去雨天泥泞翻浆、晴天尘土飞扬的状况。在南方的一些地区，普遍推广了铺磨耗层和保护层的经验，提高了石料路面的质量。这项经验在1955年以前还只在浙江、福建等地区推广，而去年已经普及全国。据二十四个省、自治区的统计，去年加铺磨耗层和保护层的公路有一万六千多公里，相当于全国泥结碎石路面的27％。加铺磨耗层不仅减少公路的大修和中修，节约养路费用，而且能使路面平整畅通，消灭坑槽。
    养路职工们积极改善土路，提高路面质量，给汽车运输带来很大好处；为挖掘运输潜力提供了有利条件。初步计算，去年凡是改善了路况的地方，汽车行驶速度每小时平均提高五公里到十公里，相当于增加二千辆汽车的运输能力。
    公路的改善不光加速了汽车的周转，对节约汽油、延长轮胎行驶里程、减少机件磨损也有直接帮助。陕西省渭南运输公司的汽车，过去在渭南养路段养护的公路上行驶，每一百公里消耗汽油二十五公升；改善路面以后，同样厂牌的汽车，仍然在原路线行驶，汽油的消耗却降低到二十公升左右。江苏省有一条公路加铺保护层以后，轮胎行驶里程平均由四万二千六百八十一公里延长到六万一千四百八十七公里。
    养路工人们在改善土路、整修路面的工作中贯彻了就地取材的方针，积极寻找天然料场，利用当地材料，因而节省很多开支。去年改善的一万多公里土路，大约为国家节约九千万元。
