    Jiangsu Local Party Committees Comprehensively Analyze Current Production Situation
    Identify Weak Links, Strengthen Specific Leadership
    A Large-Scale Production Campaign Primarily Aimed at Securing a Bumper Harvest of Summer Crops is Unfolding

    (Our Newspaper News) Our Newspaper reporter Zhen Weimin reports: Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province, through investigating "whether the current agricultural production is better or worse than the same period last year," have identified the weak links in current production, mobilized the masses, and strengthened field management of summer crops. A large-scale spring production campaign is now unfolding.

    The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, seeing that many rural cadres had a fear of difficulties in carrying out this year's agricultural production, previously posed a question: "How is the current agricultural production situation compared to the same period last year? Which aspects are better than last year? Which aspects are worse than last year?" It requested local committees to conduct comprehensive analysis and typical investigations in a realistic manner, to find the causes and methods to overcome difficulties. The third provincial district committee secretary meeting also held a special discussion and study on this issue, and reached a relatively unified view.

    According to reports, the natural conditions and production situations vary in different parts of the province, and the conclusions of the investigation and analysis are also not completely the same. However, on the whole, the current production mood of the peasants is normal and is gradually rising. This year's agricultural production still has many measures to increase production that are better than last year. For example, although summer crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and green manure were planted later than last year, with insufficient fertilization, and their growth is worse, the sown area is larger than last year; the use of improved varieties, wide ridges, and close planting, and other technical measures are better than last year. Small-scale farmland water conservancy projects are not as good as last year, but large and medium-sized farmland water conservancy projects are no less than last year. Although the accumulation of natural fertilizer is less than last year, the amount of fertilizer accumulated from pig raising has increased compared to last year; winter sideline production has also increased compared to last year. Therefore, it is generally believed that there are many favorable conditions for striving for a large-scale bumper harvest of summer crops this year.

    Around the time of the third provincial district committee secretary meeting, the socialist publicity campaign throughout the province is unfolding in depth. Cadres and the masses have further realized the great role of advanced cooperatives in resisting disasters, protecting production, improving cultivation systems, ensuring agricultural production increases, and ensuring increased income for cooperative members.

    After investigation and analysis, Party committees at all levels prominently put forward the slogan of strengthening field management of summer crops. The output of summer crops accounts for about one-third of the province's total grain output. It is currently the growing season for summer crops. The masses believe that "summer harvest is the foundation of the autumn harvest," and universally demand that the leadership strengthen production leadership. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee and various prefectural committees have repeatedly emphasized strengthening Party leadership and have dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside in the rain and snow to help with work. In the process of strengthening field management of summer crops, the top priority has been to do a good job in topdressing summer crop fields. In the Songjiang Special Zone and Kunshan, Wujiang, Zhenze, and other counties, more than 80% of the wheat fields have been topdressed once, and in Zhenze County, 85% of the rapeseed has also been topdressed twice. After topdressing, the wheat seedlings have generally turned from yellow to green, and those that had not emerged completely have now emerged.

    Around the Spring Festival, rain and snow fell widely throughout the province. Various localities seized the opportunity of warmer weather and melting snow to moisten the soil, and universally carried out ditching and drainage, loosening soil, earthing up, protecting seedlings from frost, preserving moisture, and draining waterlogged fields.

    In addition to summer crop management, all localities have also made great efforts in many important aspects of other agricultural production. Farmland water conservancy projects throughout the province last winter can improve irrigation conditions for more than three million mu of farmland, and spring repairs have also begun successively. Various localities have also launched diverse fertilizer accumulation campaigns. In the water network areas, many agricultural boats broke the ice and went out to collect mud from the rivers; in the hilly areas, ponds and dams were overturned; in the plains areas, rivers were dredged and mud was excavated to accumulate a large amount of base fertilizer for the autumn harvest.

    On February 12th, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee and the Provincial Party Committee jointly issued instructions on launching a spring production campaign, requiring all localities to seize the opportunity to launch a large-scale, vigorous spring production campaign.

    江苏各地党委全面分析当前生产情况
    找到薄弱环节加强具体领导
    以首先争取夏熟作物丰收为主的大生产运动正在展开
    本报讯　本报记者甄为民报道：江苏省各地党委通过对“当前农业生产比上年同期究竟是好是坏”的调查，找到了当前生产的薄弱环节，发动群众，加强夏熟作物田间管理，一个巨大规模的春季大生产运动正在展开。
    中共江苏省委看到许多农村干部对开展今年的农业生产有畏难情绪，不久以前曾出了一个题目：“当前的农业生产情况，比上年同期究竟如何？哪些地方比去年好？哪些地方比去年差？”要求各地委实事求是地进行全面分析和典型调查，寻找原因和克服困难的办法。全省第三次区委书记会议上也对这个问题作了专题讨论研究，并且取得了比较一致的看法。
    据汇报，全省各地自然条件、生产情况不尽相同，调查分析的结论也不完全相同，但是，总的看来，当前农民的生产情绪是正常的，并且是逐步高涨的。今年的农业生产仍然有许多增产措施比去年好。例如三麦、油菜、绿肥等夏熟作物虽较上年种得迟，施肥不足，生长情况较差，但播种面积比上年扩大；选用良种、宽垅密植等技术措施，比去年做得好。小型农田水利虽不如上年，但大、中型的农田水利工程却不比上年少。积聚自然肥料虽比上年减少，但养猪积肥量却比上年增加；冬季副业生产也比上年有所增长。因此，普遍认为争取今年大面积夏熟作物丰收，是有许多有利条件的。
    全省第三次区委书记会议前后，全省范围内的社会主义宣传运动正在深入展开，干部群众都进一步认识到高级社在抗灾保产和改良耕作制度、保证农业增产、保证社员增加收入中的巨大作用。
    各地党委调查摸底、排队分析之后，突出地提出了加强夏熟田间管理的口号。夏熟产量约占全省粮食总产量的三分之一，目前正到夏熟生长发育时期，群众认为“夏熟是秋熟的本钱”，普遍要求领导上加强生产领导。因此，省委和各个地委都一再强调了加强党的领导，并且已经派出大批干部冒雨冒雪下乡，帮助工作。在加强夏熟田间管理的过程中，首先做好了夏熟田追肥工作。松江专区和昆山、吴江、震泽等县都有80％以上麦田追施了一遍肥料，震泽县85％的油菜也已追施了两遍肥料。追肥以后，麦苗已普遍由黄转青，没有出齐的也出齐了。
    春节前后，全省各地普降雨雪。各地抓紧了天气转暖、融雪润土的时机，普遍在开沟排水、松土、壅土、保苗防冻，保墒排涝。
    除夏熟管理外，各地对于其他农业生产上的许多重要环节，也作了巨大的努力。全省去冬农田水利工程可以改善三百多万亩农田的灌溉条件，春修也相继动工。各地还开展了多样性的积肥运动。水网地区许多农船破冰出动，下河取泥；丘陵地区翻塘倒坝；平原地区开河挖泥，大量积聚秋熟基肥。
    2月12日，江苏省人民委员会和省委又发出了关于开展春季生产运动的指示，要求各地抓紧时机，掀起一个规模巨大的、轰轰烈烈的春季大生产运动。
