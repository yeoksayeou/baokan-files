Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 7th. The precious drug Aureomycin, successfully trial-produced in our country, has been processed into its first batch of finished products around the Spring Festival and has begun to be supplied to medical units in Shanghai.

　　This batch of Aureomycin was made by the Shanghai Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry and processed by the Shanghai Kefa Pharmaceutical Factory. The quantity is not large. The expansion project of the Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory, which is being expanded for mass production of Aureomycin, is currently underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of this year. After completion, mass production of Aureomycin will save the country tens of thousands of yuan in foreign exchange each year.

　　Aureomycin is a highly effective antibiotic drug. It has special effects on diseases such as pneumonia and typhus. In the past, our country has relied on imports from abroad.

    国产金霉素开始供应
    新华社上海7日电　我国试制成功的贵重药品金霉素，已经在春节前后加工制成第一批成品，并且开始向上海各医疗单位供应。
    这一批金霉素是化学工业部上海科学研究所做出来的，由上海科发药厂加工，数量不多。为大量生产金霉素而进行扩建的上海第三制药厂，扩建工程目前正在积极进行，预计在今年上半年可以完工；完工以后大量生产金霉素，每年能使国家节省几十万元的外汇。
    金霉素是疗效很高的一种抗生素类药品。它对肺炎、斑疹伤寒等疾病，有特殊功效，过去我国一直是依靠国外进口的。
