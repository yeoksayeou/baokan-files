    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 19th: Yesterday, more than one hundred cadres departed from Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province, to work in the new immigrant villages of the "Great Northern Wilderness." This group of cadres was recently selected by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party from provincial-level leading organizations. Among them, 95% are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, and more than forty people previously held positions as section chiefs and division chiefs. These cadres have all worked in rural areas in the past, many of them have held leadership positions in rural areas, participated in the land reform movement, and have certain experience in rural work.

    The vast majority of these cadres will be assigned to serve as secretaries of the Communist Party's general branch in the new villages, as well as village heads and other positions, thereby changing the current situation of weak leading backbone and poor political and ideological work in the new immigrant villages.

    百余干部到“北大荒”
    加强移民新村的工作
    据新华社哈尔滨19日电　昨天，有一百多名干部从黑龙江省会哈尔滨市出发，到“北大荒”的移民新村去工作。这一批干部是中共黑龙江省委员会最近从省级领导机关中抽调出来的，其中95％是共产党员和青年团员，有四十多人原来担任处长和科长职务。这批干部过去都在农村工作过，许多人担任过农村领导工作，参加过土地改革运动，有一定的农村工作经验。
    这些干部绝大部分将被分配担任新村的中共乡总支书记，乡长等职务，从而改变目前移民新村领导骨干弱，政治思想工作差的局面。
