Xinhua News Agency Report: The violin used by the famous Chinese violinist Ma Sicong in his recent violin solo concert in Beijing was a precious ancient qin purchased for four thousand yuan. According to Ma Sicong, this violin is the work of the Italian violin master Amati from more than 300 years ago. Amati was the creator of the modern violin style, and very few of the violins he personally made still exist in the world today.

This violin is as light as a stack of cotton. Most of the paint on the head and body of the violin has peeled off, and the maple fish-scale grain of the faceplate gleams. Only by looking through the half-finger-width "f-holes" can one see the maker's name and date written inside in Italian.

According to this famous violinist, the characteristic of this qin is its soft and resonant tone. When he used this ancient violin to perform at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou, which was filled with five thousand spectators, without an amplifier, the sound of the qin still resounded throughout the entire venue.

    一把珍贵的古琴
    据新华社讯　我国著名小提琴家马思聪最近在北京举行的小提琴独奏会上所用的小提琴，是用四千元买到的一把珍贵古琴。据马思聪说，这把小提琴是三百多年前意大利制琴大师阿马底的作品。阿马底是现代小提琴式样的创造者，他亲手制作的琴至今留在世界上的已经异常稀少了。
    这把琴轻如一叠棉絮。琴头和琴身的油漆大部脱落，面板的枫木鱼纹闪闪有光。透过半指宽的“爱福孔”才能看见里边用意大利文写的制作者的名字和年代。
    据这位著名小提琴家说：这个琴的特点是音色柔和响亮。他用这把古老的小提琴在广州坐满五千观众的中山纪念堂演奏时，没有扩音器，琴声依然响亮地传遍全场。
