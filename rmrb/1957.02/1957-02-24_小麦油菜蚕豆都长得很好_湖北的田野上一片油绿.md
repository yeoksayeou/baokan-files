Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd. Hubei Province, which achieved a bumper harvest in agricultural production last year, has over 40 million mu of summer-harvested wheat, rapeseed, barley, and broad beans growing very well this year. The fields are a sea of green, wheat seedlings are already half a foot tall, and rapeseed and broad beans are developing well. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions are stepping up cultivation to strive for even greater harvests.

　　These days, on the vast banks of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, the weather is mild and sunny, and the fields are alive with people clearing ditches, draining waterlogged areas, and weeding and applying fertilizer. Agricultural cooperatives in the Jianghan Plain and eastern and northern Hubei, through field inspections, discovered that a small number of wheat seedlings and rapeseed were growing somewhat weak, and thus launched a "movement to eliminate the three categories of seedlings." More than 100 agricultural cooperatives in Xiaogang District, Yangxin County, initiated a red flag competition, with 30,000 people working in the fields every day. They guarantee that before "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects) on March 6th, they will complete all weeding and fertilization work for summer-harvested crops. Members of agricultural cooperatives in Baimiaohe Township, Luotian County, in the Dabie Mountains, proposed to eliminate the three categories of seedlings, improve the second category of seedlings, and catch up with the first category of seedlings. All male and female laborers were mobilized, and in three days, they universally applied fertilizer to the second and third categories of seedlings. The Dongfanghong First Agricultural Cooperative in Zao Yang County implemented three defenses for wheat fields: against flooding, against damage from livestock, and against yellowing and weakness. All ditches in the fields have been cleared, poultry and livestock are being looked after by cooperative members, and fertilizer has been applied to the thin fields.

　　After the Spring Festival, Hubei Province experienced several heavy snowfalls and continuous rain, and crops in some low-lying areas suffered from waterlogging and frost. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions also universally carried out work to break the ice, drain waterlogged areas, and apply fertilizer to promote seedling growth, not allowing a single crop to be harmed. Agricultural cooperatives in Zao Yang County mobilized young people and strong laborers to rush to clear ditches and drain waterlogged areas, quickly rescuing the waterlogged crops. In Chenchang Township, Dangyang County, in the Wudang Mountains, which suffered more severe waterlogging, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members took the lead in breaking the ice and draining waterlogged areas, moving many families who planned to visit relatives and friends to join the struggle to drain waterlogged areas and rescue more than 20,000 mu of summer-harvested crops.

    小麦油菜蚕豆都长得很好
    湖北的田野上一片油绿
    新华社武汉22日电　去年农业生产获得大丰收的湖北省，今年四千多万亩夏收的小麦、油菜、大麦和蚕豆等，大部长得很好。田野里一片油绿，麦苗已半尺高，油菜和蚕豆正发棵。各地农业社正加紧培育，争取更大的丰收。
    这几天，辽阔的长江、汉水两岸，风和日暖，田间到处活跃着清沟排渍和薅草追肥的人群。江汉平原和鄂东、鄂北地区的农业社，通过田间检查，发现少数麦苗和油菜等长得有些瘦弱，于是就掀起了一个“消灭三类苗运动”；阳新县肖港区的一百多个农业社，发起了红旗竞赛，每天有三万人下畈，他们保证在3月6日“惊蛰”前，把夏收作物除草和追肥工作全部作好；大别山区罗田县白庙河乡的农业社社员们提出要消灭三类苗，提高二类苗，赶上一类苗。男女劳动力全部出动，三天时间，就给二类和三类苗普遍追了一次肥；枣阳县东方红第一农业社并对小麦地实行了三防：防涝、防六畜害、防黄瘦。地里已全部清沟，家禽牲畜由社员看管起来，瘦田都追了肥。
    春节过后，湖北省接连落了几场大雪和霪雨，有些低洼地区的作物，受渍冰冻。各地农业社还普遍开展了破冰排渍，追肥提苗的工作，不让一棵庄稼受害。枣阳县的农业社发动青年、壮年突击清沟排渍，很快救出了受渍的作物；受渍较重的武当山区当阳县陈场乡，共产党员和青年团员带头破冰排渍，感动了很多打算串亲访友的人家，也一起投入排渍的斗争，救出了两万多亩夏收作物。
