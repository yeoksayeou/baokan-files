Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 13th. More than two million mu of rapeseed in Yunnan Province have universally branched and are in bloom. According to estimates from the provincial agricultural leadership departments, barring unexpected losses, Yunnan will have a bumper rapeseed harvest this year, and the total output may increase by more than 20% compared to last year.

Rapeseed oil is the main cooking oil for the people of Yunnan, and rapeseed planting is relatively common. In 1953, relevant departments in Yunnan Province mistakenly believed that Yunnan had a surplus of rapeseed oil, and reduced the planting area of rapeseed, which led to a tight supply of oil on the market. Last winter, the above-mentioned error was corrected, and the rapeseed planting area was expanded by 16.2% compared to 1955.

At present, all localities attach great importance to striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest this year. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have strengthened field management of rapeseed, are processing and cultivating it, and are taking measures to prevent possible disasters.

    云南油菜开花了
    种植面积比去年大
    新华社昆明13日电　云南省二百多万亩油菜已普遍分枝开花。据省农业领导部门的估计，今后如果没有意外的损失，今年云南的油菜籽将丰收，总产量可能比去年增加20％以上。
    菜油是云南人民的主要食油，油菜种植较普遍。1953年云南省的有关部门曾错误地以为云南菜油过剩，缩小了油菜的种植面积，因而市场油料供应一直紧张。去年冬天，纠正了上述错误，油菜播种面积比1955年扩大了16.2％。
    现在，各地对争取今年油菜丰收都很重视，各地农业社都加强了油菜的田间管理，加工培育，并且正在采取措施预防可能的灾害。
