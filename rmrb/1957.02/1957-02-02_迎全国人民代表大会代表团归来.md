    Welcoming the Return of the National People's Congress Delegation
    Our National People's Congress Delegation, led by Comrade Peng Zhen, returned to Beijing yesterday after being invited to visit the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia. The delegation began its visit on November 15 last year, lasting over two months and traveling over ten thousand miles. This visit not only brought the friendship and respect of our six hundred million people to the six socialist countries in Europe, but also returned laden with the deep friendship of the peoples of those six countries. The facts of the past two months have made us satisfied that this first delegation sent by our National People's Congress has achieved good results in enhancing the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of our country and the people of the European socialist countries, and in strengthening the cause of unity among socialist countries.
    During this friendly visit, the delegation not only met with the parliaments and party and government leaders of various countries, but also with the broad masses of working people of those countries. The delegation extensively visited factories, enterprises, farms, organizations, and schools in these countries, contacted representative figures from all walks of life, and held talks or discussions with them. In these meetings and contacts, the delegation learned about the organizational structure and specific work of the parliaments of various countries, the great achievements made by various countries in socialist construction, and the problems they need to solve on their way forward; it learned about many basic commonalities in the socialist development of various countries and some characteristics arising from different historical conditions. At the same time, the delegation also introduced to the people of various countries the achievements of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and introduced the situation in various aspects of our society. These have undoubtedly greatly enhanced the mutual understanding and recognition between the people of our country and the people of various socialist countries, thereby further consolidating and deepening the profound friendship between them; at the same time, it has also given us the opportunity to learn from the valuable experience accumulated by various countries in many years of socialist construction, especially the rich experience of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union. During this visit, the delegation witnessed the economic upsurge, cultural prosperity, and happy life of the people in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and became even more convinced that the advanced socialist system is the fundamental guarantee for promoting the unlimited development of productive forces, the continuous expansion of the people's democratic freedom, and the increasing growth of material welfare. Therefore, this visit will not only greatly strengthen the confidence of our people in the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, but will also further encourage the great enthusiasm of our people to further build socialism.
    Our National People's Congress Delegation went on its visit with the deep desire to strengthen the unity among socialist countries. This desire has been universally echoed. The unity and mutual assistance among socialist countries based on proletarian internationalism has been recognized as being in the fundamental interests of the people of all socialist countries and the entire socialist cause. In the current international situation, at a time when the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is continuing to attempt to undermine the unity of socialist countries, it is even more necessary to protect and strengthen the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. Because this unity is the most important factor in defeating all the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressive forces and guaranteeing the victory of peace and the socialist cause.
    Socialist countries are linked together by the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and common vital interests. Even if there are some inconsistencies in certain views and understandings, this does not hinder and should never hinder their consistency in the most important and fundamental aspects, and these different views can be gradually understood and unified through frank exchanges of opinions and comradely discussions. In strengthening the unity of socialist countries and enhancing mutual understanding of various issues, in addition to the talks between the leaders of the parties and states of various countries, the mutual exchanges and contacts of parliamentary delegations as the highest organs of state power are undoubtedly an effective way that deserves attention.
    In the past few years, our country has received some foreign parliamentary delegations who have come to visit our country. This time, our National People's Congress sent a delegation to visit the Soviet Union and other socialist countries for the first time. The external relations of our National People's Congress will be further strengthened in the future. We are very willing to receive parliamentary delegations from various socialist countries on our land, and we also welcome parliamentary delegations from all countries in the world. We sincerely hope that through the mutual visits and contacts of parliamentary delegations from various socialist countries and countries around the world, the great unity of socialist countries will be further strengthened, and the mutual understanding of countries around the world will be further deepened. We believe that if the parliaments of various countries, which possess the highest state power and are the most direct and most concentrated representatives of the will of the people of various countries, strengthen their ties with each other, find a common language on major issues concerning the vital interests of the people of various countries, and undertake the cause of promoting international cooperation and safeguarding peace, then they will make a significant contribution to the noble cause of human progress.

### 迎全国人民代表大会代表团归来

    迎全国人民代表大会代表团归来
    我全国人民代表大会代表团，由彭真同志率领，在应邀访问了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和南斯拉夫以后，已于昨日返抵北京。从去年11月15日起，代表团就开始了这次访问，历时逾二月，行程过万里。这次访问不但把我国六亿人民的友谊和敬意带给了欧洲的六个社会主义国家，并且也满载了六国人民的深厚友谊而归来。两个多月来的事实使我们满意地认为，我全国人民代表大会第一次派出的这个访问团，在增进我国人民同欧洲各社会主义国家人民的友谊和相互了解方面，在加强社会主义国家之间团结的事业方面，已经获得了良好的成果。
    在这次友好访问中，代表团不但会见了各国议会和党政领导人，而且也会见了各国的广大劳动人民。代表团广泛地访问和参观了这些国家的工厂、企业、农庄、机关和学校，接触了这些国家各方面的代表性人物，同他们进行了交谈或举行了座谈。在这些会见和接触中，代表团了解了各国议会的组织情况和具体工作，各国在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就和它们在前进途中需要解决的问题；了解了各国社会主义发展中的许多基本的共同点和在若干不同的历史条件下所产生的一些特点。同时，代表团也向各国人民介绍了我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的成就，介绍了我国社会各方面的情况。这些无疑地大大增进了我国人民同各社会主义国家人民的相互了解和认识，从而进一步巩固和加深了相互之间的深厚友谊；同时也使我们有机会学习各国在多年社会主义建设中积累起来的宝贵经验，特别是第一个社会主义国家苏联的丰富经验。代表团在这次访问中看到了苏联和其他社会主义国家的经济高涨、文化繁荣和人民幸福生活的情况，更加深信先进的社会主义制度是促进生产力无限发展、人民的民主自由不断扩大和物质福利日益增长的根本保证。因此，这次访问不但将大大地加强我国人民对于社会主义制度无比优越性的信心，而且将更加鼓舞我国人民进一步建设社会主义的巨大热情。
    我全国人民代表大会代表团带着加强社会主义各国之间团结的深切愿望而去进行访问的。这种愿望已得到了普遍的共鸣。社会主义国家之间以无产阶级国际主义为基础的团结和互助，已被公认是各个社会主义国家的人民和整个社会主义事业的根本利益之所在。在目前的国际局势下，在以美国为首的帝国主义集团正在继续企图破坏社会主义国家团结的情况下，保护和加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结显得更加必要。因为这种团结是击败帝国主义侵略势力的一切阴谋和保证和平与社会主义事业胜利的最重要的因素。
    社会主义各国是由马克思列宁主义的共同思想和共同的切身利益而联系在一起的。即使在某些见解和认识上有不完全一致的地方，但这并不妨碍也决不应该妨碍它们在最主要和最根本方面的一致，而这些不同的见解是完全可以经过坦率的交换意见和同志般的讨论而逐步地求得谅解和一致的。在加强社会主义国家的团结和增进彼此对于各种问题的相互了解方面，除了各国党和国家领导人的会谈以外，作为最高国家权力机关的议会代表团的相互往来和接触，无疑地也是一种值得重视的有效方式。
    在过去几年里，我国曾经接待过来我国访问的一些外国的议会代表团。这次我全国人民代表大会第一次派出了代表团去苏联和其他社会主义国家访问。我全国人民代表大会的对外联系今后将进一步加强起来。我们很愿意在我国的土地上接待来自各社会主义国家的议会代表团，同时也欢迎来自世界上一切国家的议会代表团。我们衷心地希望，通过各社会主义国家和世界各国议会代表团的互相访问和接触，进一步加强社会主义各国的伟大团结，进一步加深世界各国的相互了解。我们认为，如果拥有国家最高权力、为各国人民意志的最直接和最集中的代表者的各国议会，加强它们彼此之间的联系，在有关各国人民切身利益的重大问题上找到共同的语言，并且把增进国际合作和维护和平的事业担当起来，那么，它们就会对人类进步的崇高事业作出重大的贡献。
