    On the Grassland
    Gaoyuan
    The Longriba area of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is an endless grassland, but it is more than 3,200 meters above sea level, and it enters a severe winter season with heavy snow in October every year. Here, since ancient times, the population has been sparse, and large tracts of land have been abandoned.
    Today, the grassland has awakened. Now there is a state-owned mechanized farm here. Tractors plow the black, oily soil, and people work hard. Crops that were once thought unable to grow are now growing. Test results have proven that highland barley, rapeseed, sunflowers, and flax are suitable for growing here. If managed properly, it can produce a large amount of grain for the country.
    I arrived on the grassland just in time for the upcoming New Year. Team Leader Wang of the mechanized farming team received me very warmly. At night, fearing that I would be cold, he asked Xiao Chen to bring me two thick quilts. In fact, I was not cold at all. There was a charcoal brazier in the room, and I also had an old sheepskin coat.
    Xiao Chen is the clerk of the mechanized farming team. He is twenty-three or four years old, with a flushed face and a ready smile. The mechanized farming team headquarters is a newly built wooden house with four rows in a 口 shape. Xiao Chen lives in a small room next to the captain's office. The two large glass windows of this small room are open, and golden sunlight shines into the room.
    For the better part of the day, Xiao Chen has been carefully arranging his room. I couldn't help, so I took the opportunity to observe this "new room." On the wall, I saw a double portrait. Xiao Chen's head was tilted, grinning, and the woman had a pair of watery eyes, with a large bow tied on her head. She was very plump, and the flesh under her neck was tightly constricted by her collar. It seemed that she also liked to smile, and her mouth always wanted to be pursed, but she still couldn't hide her smile.
    "Is this your wife?" I asked, pointing to the picture.
    "Hehe...yes."
    "Why haven't I seen her?"
    "She's not here. She works in cultural and educational work at the Western Sichuan Forestry Bureau in Li County."
    "It's almost the New Year, isn't she coming back?" I asked again.
    "She's coming back soon. According to her letter, she should have been back the day before yesterday."
    It is completely understandable that Xiao Chen yearns for his long-separated lover. He tried his best to decorate this room beautifully so that the young couple could spend a happy and joyful New Year here.
    The courtyard was noisy. Some were beating small drums, some were singing newly taught songs, and yaks were swaying their heavy bodies in the golden sunlight.
    "Xiao Chen!" Team Leader Wang walked over: "There's a task. Just now, the farm headquarters sent a notice to re-calculate the highland barley harvest accounts. You go to the farm headquarters on horseback immediately..."
    "I..." Xiao Chen wanted to say something, but quickly swallowed it back, scratched his black hair, and then said, "Okay, I'll go."
    Xiao Chen stood in the middle of the room and looked around for a while, then turned back and told me to sit in his room temporarily: "My wife might arrive today."
    Xiao Chen rode a chestnut horse and left. I stayed in the room. As the sun gradually set in the west, Lu Xia arrived. Her face was red from the cold, and a red scarf around her neck made her look very bright and beautiful. She was also carrying a large wild pheasant with bright feathers in her hand.
    "Lu Xia, do you think this room is pretty?" A young man wearing a fox fur hat looked into her eyes.
    "Pretty, pretty, let me ask you! Where did Xiao Chen go?" Lu Xia rubbed her hands and said with a smile.
    "Xiao Chen! He's angry. He waited for you on the left and waited for you on the right, but you didn't come. Why are you so late?"
    "We are busy. The fourth quarter timber felling task has not been completed. Yesterday, I just came back from Daban Zhao. I finally managed to buy a bus ticket... To be honest, I'll cook pheasant tonight for you to eat."
    "Keep your word, don't lie! I'm telling you the truth, Xiao Chen went to the farm headquarters."
    "Went to the farm headquarters?"
    "There's a task! You only know that your logging work is busy, but you don't know that we engaged in production are also busy."
    "Busy? The grassland is covered with ice and snow in winter, what production are you doing?"
    "Look, you're at it again. After we finish a year of production, shouldn't we fully summarize the experience?"
    The room was crowded and noisy. Everyone was concerned about and asking about the forest logging situation. Lu Xia always answered with a smile, from pheasants to muntjacs, to red-faced monkeys, saying that the forest is not only the wealth of the motherland, but also has many unfathomable treasures in the mountains.
    Lu Xia went outside for a while, and then went to the yard to look at the sun. Team Leader Wang joked with her: "Don't be too anxious, you will always see him tonight."
    It was getting dark, and the room was lit with lights, and the charcoal in the basin was bursting with sparks. The night on the grassland was quiet, but this small room was full of laughter, friendship, and joy.
    "Listen! The big red horse is snorting as it comes." A squadron leader wearing a leopard skin coat suddenly stood up and said.
    Two young men ran out.
    Xiao Chen walked in, and the laughter in the room was even louder than before. Lu Xia stepped forward and used a towel to wipe the frost that had formed on his hat and clothes.

    在草原上
    高原
    阿坝藏族自治州龙日坝一带，虽然是一望无垠的大草原，但却有拔海三千二百余公尺的高度，每年十月便进入大雪霏霏的严寒季节。这里，自古以来，人烟稀少，大块大块的地荒废着。
    今天，草原已经睡醒了。现在这里已经有了国营机耕农场，拖拉机把黑油油的土地翻耕起来，人们辛勤地劳动着。过去认为不能生长的庄稼现在生长起来了。试验结果证明：青稞、油菜、向日葵、亚麻都宜于在这里生长。经营得法，能为国家生产大量的粮食。
    我到草原上，正赶上快要过年。机耕队王队长招待我非常热情，夜里，他怕我冻着，叫小陈抱两条厚棉被给我盖。其实，我一点不冷，屋子里既有炭火盆，我又有一件老羊皮袄。
    小陈，是机耕队的文书，二十三、四岁，脸红糊糊的，很爱笑。机耕队部是口字形四排新修的木房子，小陈就住在紧靠队长办公室的一个小房间里。这个小房间两扇大玻璃窗敞开着，屋子里射进来金灿灿的阳光。
    大半天来，小陈都在认真地布置着他的房间。我在一旁又插不上手，便趁空来观察这个像“新房”一样的房间。在墙上，我看到一张双人合照的像片，小陈头歪着，咧着嘴笑，女的一对水汪汪的大眼，头上打一个大蝴蝶结，人很胖，脖子下面的肉被衣领勒得紧绷绷的。看样子，也有点爱笑，嘴老是想抿着，但仍然掩饰不住笑容。
    “这是你的爱人吧？”我指着像片问。
    “嘿嘿……是的。”
    “怎么没有见她呢？”
    “她不在这里，她在理县川西森林工业局搞文教工作。”
    “快过年了，她还不回来吗？”我又追着问。
    “快回来了，照她的信上说，前天就应当回来了。”
    完全可以理解小陈渴望久别的爱人的心情。他尽量想把这个房间打扮得漂亮一些，小两口好在这里度过一个欢乐愉快的年节。
    院子里闹哄哄的，有的在敲打着小鼓，有的在唱着新教的歌子，牦牛在金灿灿的阳光里摇动着笨重的身躯。
    “小陈！”王队长走了过来：“有个任务，刚才场部来了一个通知，要把青稞的收获账再核算一遍，你马上骑马到场部去一趟……”
    “我……”小陈刚想向下说，连忙又吞回去，用手抓了抓他那乌黑的头发，紧接着说：“好，我去。”
    小陈站在屋子的中间左右端详了一会，回过头来，叮咛我暂时坐在他的屋里：“我爱人说不定今天就会到来。”
    小陈骑着一匹枣红色的马走了。我留在屋子里。太阳渐渐地西斜的时候，陆霞来了。她脸冻得红通通的，脖子上围着一块红围巾，显得非常艳丽好看，她手里还提着一只羽毛鲜丽的大野鸡。
    “陆霞，你看这房间漂亮不？”一个戴狐皮帽子的小伙子瞅着她的眼睛。
    “漂亮，漂亮，我问你哟！小陈到哪里去了？”陆霞搓了搓手，笑着说。
    “小陈啊！他生气了，左等你也不来，右等你也不来，你为什么来得这样晚？”
    “我们正在忙着哩，第四季度砍伐木材的任务还没有完成，昨天，我才从大板昭回来，好容易才买到一张汽车票，……说实话，今天晚上煮野鸡肉给你吃。”
    “说话算话，不要骗人！跟你说真的，小陈到场部去了。”
    “到场部去了？”
    “有任务嘛！你光晓得你们伐木工作忙，你就不晓得我们搞生产的也忙。”
    “忙，冬天的草原冰天雪地，还搞什么生产？”
    “看，你又来了，我们搞完一年生产，是不是要把经验全面地总结一下呢？”
    屋子里闹哄哄地挤满着人。大家都在关心和询问着森林采伐的情况，陆霞总是笑呵呵地回答着，由野鸡说到麂子，说到红面猴，说到森林不但是祖国的财富，山里还有许多摸不透的宝藏。
    陆霞一会儿到外面去一次，一会儿又到院坝里看看太阳。王队长和她开玩笑说：“不要太急，今晚上你总会看见他的。”
    天快黑了，屋子里已点上了灯火，盆里的炭火爆着火星。草原上的夜是静寂的，但在这间小屋子里却充满着笑声，充满着友谊和欢乐。
    “听！大红马打着响鼻子来了。”一个穿豹子皮大衣的分队长突然站起来说。
    两个小伙子跑出去了。
    小陈走了进来，屋子里的笑声比先前更加响亮了。陆霞走上前去，用手巾拂去他帽子上和衣服上凝结成的霜花。
