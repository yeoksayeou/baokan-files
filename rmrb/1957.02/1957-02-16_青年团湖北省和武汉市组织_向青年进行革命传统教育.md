Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 15th: On the afternoon of the 12th, Major General Ding Wenxuan of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan told more than 1,500 young people from directly subordinate organizations in Hubei Province the story of crossing the snowy mountains and grasslands during the Long March. Major General Ding Wenxuan, who was then a division commander in the Fourth Front Army, recalled the situation at the time, saying: The biggest difficulty on the grassland at that time was the lack of food, and it rained all day, so some comrades sacrificed. Even under such difficult conditions, everyone maintained high revolutionary enthusiasm. Some Communist Youth League members, only fourteen or fifteen years old, not only shouldered the tasks of marching and fighting like adults, but also actively conducted social surveys and propaganda to the masses after arriving at their驻地. They encouraged many young people to join the Red Army. He called on the young people to learn this spirit of hard struggle, inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition of the older generation of youth, and build our socialist motherland.

This report meeting was organized by the Hubei Province Directly Subordinate Organizations Working Committee of the Youth League. In the future, various story report meetings will also be held on the historical stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Self-Defense War, and it is expected that 30,000 young people will receive this revolutionary tradition education.

Recently, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Youth League has also universally carried out revolutionary tradition education among young people in government offices, enterprises, and schools, and organized a lecture group composed of more than 70 comrades who personally experienced struggles in various historical stages to give reports to young people in different districts and areas. Around the "February 7th" period, the Youth League organizations at all levels also organized visiting groups to visit the families of martyrs and veteran workers of the "February 7th" strike in Jiang'an. Some visited the sites of the struggle in those years. Up to now, more than 30,000 young people from more than 20 units have listened to the reports of veteran workers on the "February 7th" struggle.

    青年团湖北省和武汉市组织
    向青年进行革命传统教育
    新华社武汉15日电　12日下午，人民解放军驻武汉部队丁文选少将向湖北省直属机关一千五百多名青年讲述了长征时过雪山草地的故事。丁文选少将当时在红四方面军任师长，他回忆当时的情景说：草地上当时最大的困难是没有粮食，还整天下雨，有的同志因此牺牲了。就在这样艰苦的情况下，大家都保持着高涨的革命热情，一些年仅十四、五岁的共青团员不仅和成人一样担负着行军、打仗的任务，而且到驻地后还积极进行社会调查工作和向群众进行宣传，他们鼓动许多青年参加了红军。他号召青年们学习这种艰苦奋斗的精神，继承上一代青年光荣的革命传统，建设我们的社会主义祖国。
    这次的报告会是青年团湖北省直属机关工作委员会组织的。今后还将举行抗日、自卫战争等历史阶段中的各种故事报告会，预计将有三万名青年受到这次革命传统的教育。
    最近，青年团武汉市委也在机关、企业、学校中向青年普遍进行革命传统教育，并且组织了一个由七十多名亲历各历史阶段斗争的同志组成的讲师团，分区分片地向青年们作报告。“二七”前后，青年团的各级组织还分别组织了访问小组，到江岸访问烈士家属和“二七”老工人，有的参观了当年斗争的遗址。到目前为止，已有二十多个单位的三万多名青年听了老工人关于“二七”斗争的报告。
