    Algerian National Liberation Army Intensifies Attacks on French Troops
    Negotiations on the Issue of French Troops Stationed in Tunisia Stalled
    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 17th: In the past two days, the Algerian National Armed Forces have launched attacks in eastern and western Algeria. Heavy fighting has also occurred between the National Armed Forces and French troops in other regions of Algeria. Reports indicate that the Algerian National Liberation Army has recently seen a significant increase in the quantity and quality of its weapons and personnel.
    In order to counter the increasingly frequent sabotage activities carried out by Algerian patriots behind French lines, the French colonial authorities have dispatched a large number of police in the past few days to conduct large-scale searches and arrests in Algiers and other cities. Nearly three hundred people were arrested in Algiers alone on the 13th. Some Algerian police officers and officials were also arrested. On the 14th, another Algerian patriotic fighter was executed in Oran.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 17th: French Deputy Foreign Minister Fouchet and Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba have failed to reach an agreement on the issue of French troops stationed in Tunisia during their three-day negotiations. The negotiations ended on the 16th.
    Reports say that Bourguiba insisted during the negotiations that French troops must withdraw from all areas of Tunisia except for the coastal areas of Bizerte and Ferryville. He also believes that negotiations between the two countries on establishing a joint defense organization can only begin after a principled agreement is reached on this issue.
    Fouchet stated after the meeting that negotiations regarding the issue of French troop deployments in Tunisia will continue soon.

    阿民族解放军加强打击法军
    法军驻扎突尼斯问题的谈判搁浅
    新华社17日讯　阿尔及尔消息：过去两天中，阿尔及利亚民族武装部队在阿尔及利亚东部和西部出击。在阿尔及利亚其他地区内，民族武装部队同法军也发生激战。消息说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的武器和兵员无论在数量和质量上，近来都有明显的增强。
    为了对付阿尔及利亚爱国者在法军后方日益开展的破坏活动，法殖民当局在过去几天里曾出动大批警察在阿尔及尔和其他城市中实行大规模的搜查和逮捕。阿尔及尔市在13日一天之内就有近三百人被捕。一些阿尔及利亚籍的警察和官吏也被逮捕。14日又有一名阿尔及利亚爱国志士在阿兰被处死。
    新华社17日讯　突尼斯消息：法国外交部副部长富尔和突尼斯首相布尔吉巴在为期三天的谈判中，没有能够就法军驻扎突尼斯问题达成协议。谈判已在16日结束。
    消息说，布尔吉巴在谈判中坚持：除了沿海的比塞大和菲雷维尔两地区外，法军必须自突尼斯境内其他地区撤退。他并且认为，只有就这个问题在原则上达成协议之后，两国关于建立共同防御组织的谈判才可能开始。
    富尔在会后表示，有关法国在突尼斯驻军问题的谈判不久将继续举行。
