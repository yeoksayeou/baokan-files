County Party Secretary Wang Mingjiang's Working Methods
Yi Mengchun

Although Hunan suffered an extremely severe drought last year, six or seven counties still achieved a bumper harvest, one of which was Linli County. I lived in Linli for about twenty days and heard people praising the benefits of the agricultural cooperatives, as well as praising their county party secretary.

One evening, around ten o'clock, in the thatched house of the Tongwen Agricultural Cooperative Management Committee, County Chief Wu Lanbo was sitting opposite the cooperative director under an oil lamp, considering problems. At this moment, a cadre from the County Committee came in. He took out several pages of densely written manuscript from his pocket and began to convey the County Committee's opinions on the current rectification of the cooperative. Finally, the cadre said, "Secretary Wang said that now, with the cold weather, the problem of fuel for the members is a major issue, and agricultural cooperatives should help members solve this problem when arranging collective production."

After listening, County Chief Wu said with emotion, "Secretary Wang is so thoughtful about the masses' firewood problem."

The comrade from the County Committee couldn't help but add, "Secretary Wang went to several backward agricultural cooperatives to understand the situation for a few days. He just came back at noon today. Without resting, he conducted research with the County Committee members who were at home. The office sorted out their opinions and transmitted them to the townships by telephone before dinner."

Listening to their conversation, I was strongly impressed by the leadership style of County Party Secretary Wang Mingjiang, so I decided to visit him.

The County Party Secretary's office was simply furnished. On the walls were several eye-catching photos and certificates, showing a glorious page in Wang Mingjiang's history. Wang Mingjiang had been awarded the title of Model Worker three times. In 1949, when the million-strong army went south, the task of selling and delivering grain locally was very heavy, and bandits were rampant. In such difficult days, he worked day and night as a district chief, excellently completing his tasks, and was awarded the glorious title of First-Class Grain Sales and Bandit Suppression Model Worker. During the autumn harvest in 1950, because he completed his tasks quickly and grasped the policies well, he was again rated as a Model Worker. At the end of 1954, eight hundred thousand laborers prevented and controlled floods and renovated Dongting Lake. The Linli labor team, with Wang Mingjiang as its political commissar, won the glorious title of "Iron Hero Brigade," and he himself was commended as a First-Class Model Worker by the headquarters.

When I arrived at the County Committee, Wang Mingjiang had gone to the countryside. I waited two days before he returned. That day, the north wind roared and snow was flying. Wang Mingjiang walked into the County Committee, his trouser legs covered in mud, and even his back had spots of mud. He was a burly figure with a smile always on his face. We talked for several hours, and his words caused me to ponder, making me deeply feel how much influence a leading cadre's leadership style has on the development of work. What is Wang Mingjiang's leadership style like? I think the following example is representative.

During last year's spring plowing production, double-cropping rice was being expanded everywhere, but there was a great shortage of draught cattle. The members couldn't make up their minds, and the county was also anxious. Just at this time, a farmer in Yuanjiang County created a double-shared wooden plow, and the drawings were published in the newspaper. The report said that this plow could double efficiency. Wang Mingjiang was very happy when he saw it and wanted to promote it throughout the county. But it was just a drawing after all. The farmers had never seen it, let alone how to operate it. So he decided to experiment himself and asked the carpenter to make two plows overnight according to the drawings.

The next day, Wang Mingjiang brought the double-shared wooden plow to the agricultural cooperative. By this time, the sun was already setting, and the members who had finished their early work were washing their hoes. When they saw the County Party Secretary with something novel, they gathered around in groups of three or five. Wang Mingjiang explained it to everyone. Several young people couldn't help but immediately move it to the field to try it out. They tied a large water buffalo to the front of the plow, and with a crack of the whip, the buffalo moved forward, and two rows of field mud rolled under the plow at the same time. But after a few minutes, the buffalo was covered in sweat, its mouth was spitting out hot air, and it wouldn't move. The young man holding the plow whipped it hard, but the buffalo didn't move at all. Someone on the bank shouted, "Don't beat the buffalo to death!" They stopped.

When the young man returned to the ridge, the members had scattered away in dissatisfaction. Wang Mingjiang was also covered in sweat. Only the township party secretary, Ding Shitong, and a few old farmers were still standing beside him.

In the evening, Wang Mingjiang ate some food casually at a member's house and carried the plow with Ding Shitong to the house of Sun Minglan, a member. Sun Minglan was the captain of the fifth production team and also a carpenter. He had originally held great hope for this double-shared wooden plow, but after seeing the plowing situation during the day, his confidence wavered.

Wang Mingjiang quickly figured out Sun Minglan's thoughts. He asked him, "Does your team lack draught cattle when it comes to four plows and four harrows to seize the season?" "We lack a lot." "Is there a solution?" "No. Everyone is very anxious." Wang Mingjiang said, "I think, since everyone can't come up with an idea right now, this double-shared wooden plow is a glimmer of hope."

Only then did Sun Minglan take out a ruler and, while looking at the drawings, measured to see if there were any errors in the dimensions. He took an axe and shaved a little here and hammered a few times there. By the time he, Wang Mingjiang, and Ding Shitong were all satisfied, it was already midnight.

The next day, Sun Minglan took the plow to the field to try it, but it didn't work. So he carried it back to shore to repair it. He tried again and repaired it again, doing this for a whole day. Wang Mingjiang was always with him.

Early the third morning, Wang Mingjiang came to the field again. He took off his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers, and said to Sun Minglan, "I'll try it today!" Sun Minglan also went down to the field to watch. After plowing for an hour, the effect was very good. Sun Minglan rushed to say, "It's a success!"

That evening, Wang Mingjiang convened a telephone conference with the district party secretaries and district chiefs, requesting that each district immediately promote this wooden plow. When promoting it, the district leaders should personally grasp the experiment and conduct demonstrations. Soon, more than 300 double-shared wooden plows were promoted throughout the county, and early rice seedlings were transplanted in time.

After telling the above story, I raised the following question: "What do you think the County Committee's work should focus on?"

He said modestly, "I can't talk about any experience. I always do this myself: For any major task, first clarify the guidelines and policies, unify the thoughts of the cadres, and make specific arrangements; after the work begins, frequently check and do investigation and research; at this time, the leaders should go down and set an example; afterwards, they should seriously summarize." He paused and continued, "Maybe none of these are the most important. The most important thing for the Party Committee is to care about people. The quality of all work depends first on how well the work on people is done. In other words, political work is the Party Committee's top priority." He thought for a moment and narrated the following incident:

"There is a female deputy director of the Lingquan Agricultural Cooperative named Wen Chungu, who has been very active in leading production and running the cooperative. She joined the Party in 1953 and was a banner for the entire county at the time. However, during this rectification of the cooperative combined with Party rectification, I heard that Wen Chungu had regressed. The cooperative cadres didn't consult with her on matters, and they often criticized her during meetings.

"I decided to go down and take a look. In Wen Chungu's small room, I talked to her for several hours. It turned out that the matter was like this: She saw that the director, accountant, and others never discussed work with her, and they passed notes to each other during meetings, as if there were some things they didn't want her to know. She thought that she had a low level of education, and since they were in charge of the cooperative's affairs anyway, she relaxed her leadership responsibilities. This was of course just a small fluctuation in thought. However, during the Party rectification, people said that she had forgotten her roots and had been poisoned by capitalist ideology, which made her very distressed and her emotions even worse.

"During the conversation, I inspired her to recall the facts of overcoming difficulties in the past. In 1955, when the male members went to control the lake, only women were left in the cooperative. She led everyone to break ice that was more than a foot thick, stood in the muddy water, dug up the pond mud, and her whole body was frozen purple, and her feet were cracked. The members who returned from controlling the lake praised the power of women when they saw the fields full of fertilizer. The Secretary of the CPC Changde Prefectural Committee also praised her in person.

"When Wen Chungu recalled these situations, she deeply felt that her current attitude towards work was wrong and expressed her willingness to make a self-criticism at the branch meeting.

"I later talked to the director and accountant to inspire them to examine their mistakes in taking on everything themselves and looking down on women.

"The branch meeting on the third day was very successful. Criticism and self-criticism were carried out well. Wen Chungu is now active again, taking the lead in production in the cold and actively doing the cooperative's affairs.

"This incident has been very enlightening to me. The Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee have both instructed that in the rectification of the cooperative and the Party, we must adhere to the method of persuasion and education and use a key to open each lock. After this incident, I understood the above instructions of the superiors more deeply and implemented them more resolutely."

    县委书记王明江的工作方法
    易孟醇
    湖南去年虽然遭受了极其严重的旱灾，但是仍然有六、七个县获得丰收，其中有一个是临澧县。我在临澧住了二十来天，听到人们称道农业社的好处的时候，同时也称道他们的县委书记。
    一天晚上十点多钟，在同文农业社管理委员会的茅舍里，吴兰波县长正和社主任相对坐在油灯下考虑问题。这时候，进来了一位县委会的干部。他从口袋里掏出几页写得密密麻麻的稿纸，开始传达县委对当前整社工作的一些意见。最后这位干部说：“王书记说，现在，天气寒冷，社员们没有柴烧，是个大问题，应该叫农业社在安排集体生产的时候，帮助社员解决这个问题。”
    吴县长听了感慨地对大家说：“王书记对群众的烧柴问题都想得这么周到。”
    县委会的这位同志听了这话，情不自禁地补充说：“王书记这次到几个后进农业社了解了几天情况，今天中午刚刚回来，没有休息，就跟在家的县委委员一起进行了研究。办公室把他们的意见整理了一下，在晚饭前就用电话下达到了各乡。”
    听了他们的谈话，县委书记王明江的领导作风给了我强烈的印象，于是我决定去访问他。
    县委书记办公室的陈设很简单，墙壁上有几张引人注意的照片和奖状，显示了王明江历史上光荣的一页。王明江曾经三次获得模范工作者的称号。1949年，百万大军南下时，地方上售粮送粮任务很繁重，土匪又很猖狂。在这样艰苦的日子里，他作为一个区长夜以继日地工作着，出色地完成了自己的任务，获得甲等售粮剿匪模范工作者的光荣称号。1950年秋征时，因为他任务完成得快，政策掌握得好，再次被评为工作模范。1954年终，八十万劳动大军防治水灾，整修洞庭湖，由王明江担任政治委员的临澧民工总队获得了“钢铁英雄总队”的光荣称号，他自己被指挥部传令嘉奖为甲等模范工作者。
    我到县委会的时候，王明江下乡去了。等了两天，他才回来。那天，北风怒号，大雪纷飞。王明江走进县委会，两裤脚满是泥浆，连背上也有点点泥斑。他的身材很魁梧，脸上老挂着笑容。我们谈了几个钟头的话，他的话引起了我的沉思，使我深深感到一个领导干部的领导作风对工作的开展会起多大的影响。王明江的领导作风是怎样的呢？我想，下面的事例是有代表性的。
    去年春耕生产时，到处都扩种双季稻，但耕牛非常缺乏。社员们拿不出主意，县里也着急。恰好这个时候，沅江县一个农民创造了一种双铧木犁，图样在报纸上公布了。报道说，用这种犁可以提高效率一倍。王明江见了很高兴，想在全县推广。可是它到底只是个图样，农民没见过，更谈不上如何操纵它。于是他决定亲自试验，请木匠照着图样，连夜赶制了两张。
    第三天，王明江带着双铧木犁到农业社来了。这时，太阳已经偏西，收早工的社员正在洗锄头。大伙一见县委书记带着新奇的东西，三五成群地围过来。王明江向大伙解释了一番。几个青年忍不住，马上搬到田里去试。他们在犁前系着一头头号大水牛，把鞭子一扬，牛带着犁哗啦哗啦向前走，两行田泥同时在犁下翻滚。但是，没等几分钟，牛出了一身大汗，口里直吐热气，不走了。扶犁的青年使劲抽鞭子，牛一动也不动。岸上有人高叫：“不要打死了牛！”他们这才住手。
    青年回到田埂上的时候，社员们已经不满意地散开了。王明江也冒了一身冷汗，只有乡支部书记丁诗同和几个老农还站在他身边。
    晚上，王明江在一个社员家里随便吃了些饭，跟丁诗同扛着犁来到了社员孙明兰家里。孙明兰是第五生产队队长，又是个木匠，他对这双铧木犁原本抱着很大希望，但看了白天的试耕情况信心动摇了。
    王明江很快摸清了孙明兰的心思。问他：“你们队里做到四犁四耙，抢住季节，缺不缺耕牛？”“缺得多。”“有没有解决办法？”“没有。大家急得很。”王明江说：“我看，既然眼前大家都拿不出主意，这双铧木犁倒是一线希望。”
    孙明兰这才拿出尺，一面看图样，一面量着，看尺寸有没有错误。他拿着斧头在这里削一点，那里锤几下。等到他和王明江、丁诗同三个人都满意的时候，已经是半夜了。
    第二天，孙明兰拿着犁在田里试，不行，又背上岸修理；再试，再修理，这样整整搞了一天。王明江总是跟他在一起。
    第三天清早，王明江又来到了田野里。他脱掉鞋袜，高卷起裤脚，对孙明兰说：“今天我来试吧！”孙明兰也下田在旁边看。犁了一个时辰，效果很好。孙明兰抢着说：“成功啦！”
    这天晚上，王明江召集各区的区委书记和区长开电话会议，要求各区立即推广这种木犁，推广时各区领导人要亲自掌握试验，进行示范。不久，全县共推广了三百多张双铧木犁，及时插下了早稻秧苗。
    在讲完上面这件事后，我提出这样一个问题：“你认为县委的工作应该抓住哪些环节？”
    他谦虚地说：“谈不上有什么经验。我自己总是这样做：任何一件重大工作，首先搞清方针政策，统一干部思想，具体布置；工作开始后，经常检查，做调查研究工作；这时领导人员要深入下去，作出榜样；事后则要认真总结。”他停了停接着说：“也许这些都不是最重要的。党委最重要的是关心人，一切工作的好坏首先看人的工作做得怎样。换句话说，政治工作是党委首位的工作。”他想了想，叙述了这样一件事：
    “灵泉农业社有个女副主任，叫文春姑，领导生产，办社，一直很积极。1953年入党，当时是全县的一面旗帜。但是，这次整社结合整党时，我听说文春姑退步了，社干部有事不找她商量，开起会来老批评她。
    “我决定下去看看。在文春姑的小屋里，我跟她谈了几个小时。原来事情是这样的：她看到主任、会计等人从来不跟她商量工作，开会时相互递纸条子，似乎有些事不愿让她知道似的。她想，自己文化低，社里的事情反正有他们管，因而放松了领导责任。这当然只是思想上的一个小小波动。但是，在整党中，人们就说她忘了本，中了资本主义思想的毒，弄得她十分苦恼，情绪更不好了。
    “我在谈话中启发她回忆过去克服困难的事实。1955年，男社员治湖去了，社里只留下妇女。她带领大家打破一尺多厚的冰块，站在泥水里，把塘泥挖上来，一身冻紫了，脚也裂了缝。治湖回来的社员看到满田的肥料，都满口称赞妇女的力量。中共常德地委书记还当面表扬过她。
    “当文春姑回想起这些情形的时候，深深觉得自己现在对待工作的态度不对，表示愿意在支部会上检查。
    “我后来又找正主任、会计谈了，启发他们检查自己包办代替、看不起妇女等等错误思想。
    “第三天的支部会开得很成功，批评和自我批评开展得不错。文春姑现在又积极了，在严寒中带头生产，社里的事情也主动地去做。
    “这件事对我自己有很大的启发。省委和地委都指示过：在整社和整党中，必须坚持说服教育的方式，并且要一把钥匙开一把锁。这件事以后，我对上级的这个指示领会得更深，贯彻得更坚决了。”
