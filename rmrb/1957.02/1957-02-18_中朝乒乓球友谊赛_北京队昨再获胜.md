    Sino-North Korean Table Tennis Friendship Tournament
    Beijing Team Wins Again Yesterday
    (Our dispatch) The North Korean table tennis team, in its second match yesterday against the Beijing Municipal Table Tennis Team, lost all three women's singles matches, five men's singles matches, and two men's doubles matches.
    The Beijing team players were generally able to exploit the weaknesses of their opponents and score points by utilizing a variety of tactics according to the situation. However, the North Korean team's powerful forehand smashes, with good angles, were rapid and forceful. This style of play is worth learning from.
    Yesterday, the North Korean players were Li Dong-suk, Baek Ok-hee, Kang Won-ok (all women), Kang Da-hyun, Kim Hong-jip, Kim Dong-soo, Li Jae-woo, Kim Jeong-soon, Seo Won-joon, and Ahn Young-sang. The Beijing team fielded Yan Jiaying, Zhang Baodi, Huang Yuqin (all women), Liang Yuhai, Cai Mingshu, Guo Yiping, Shi Jiaxian, Yang Kaiyun, and Jin Shenghua.
    After the match, Vice Premier He Long, who watched the competition, met with the entire North Korean team and took photos with them.

    中朝乒乓球友谊赛
    北京队昨再获胜
    本报讯　昨天再度同北京市乒乓球队交锋的朝鲜乒乓球队，在三场女子单打、五场男子单打和两场男子双打比赛中，全部失利。
    北京队队员基本上能够根据对手情况利用多样化战术攻其弱点得分。但是，朝鲜队的大板正手猛抽球，角度好，急而有力。这种打法是值得我们学习的。
    昨天，朝鲜队的出场队员是李东淑、白玉姬、康元玉（以上女）、康达铉、金弘集、金东洙、李在雨、金正淳、徐元俊、安英祥。北京队以严家英、章宝娣、黄玉琴（以上女）、梁玉海、蔡明枢、郭毅萍、施家贤、杨开运、靳声华上阵。
    比赛结束后，观看比赛的贺龙副总理到场上接见了朝鲜队的全体人员，并且和他们在一起照了像。
