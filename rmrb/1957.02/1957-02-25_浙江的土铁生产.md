    Zhejiang's Indigenous Iron Production
    Fu Baoyong, Zhang Tang
    In the context of tight steel raw material supplies, how to tap local production potential, alleviate the strain on steel raw material supplies, and ensure the production needs of certain products is a problem that must be taken seriously at present.

    According to surveys, Zhejiang Province has several million tons of indigenous iron ore reserves. Indigenous iron production has a history of about 300 years. The main producing areas are the Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Jinhua special districts, with Wenzhou Special District accounting for the largest share, about half of the province's annual output.

    In the past, the main raw material for Zhejiang's indigenous agricultural tools was indigenous iron. Since 1955, when a large amount of scrap steel from other places was imported into Zhejiang, indigenous iron sales were greatly affected due to the low price and ease of processing of scrap steel, and production plummeted. Yunhe County, which had the highest output, reduced production by 10% in 1955 compared to 1954; and in 1956, production decreased by another 5% compared to 1955. As a result, some leading departments doubted the development prospects of indigenous iron and adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards indigenous iron production.

    This year, in the context of insufficient pig iron raw material supply, indigenous iron production has attracted attention from all sides. However, at present, there are still many problems in indigenous iron production. To develop indigenous iron production, leading departments must start to solve these problems.

    First, the backwardness of indigenous iron production equipment and the low level of operational technology are important obstacles affecting the development of indigenous iron production. According to a survey of nine better-performing indigenous iron production cooperatives, in terms of power equipment, only two cooperatives use charcoal engines, one uses hydropower, and the rest use manpower. According to the survey, the Pingyang Tiaoxi Production Cooperative, which uses charcoal engines, has a daily output of 650 to 750 kilograms of iron per furnace. The Ruian Gaolou Township Cooperative, which uses manpower, has a daily output of only 300 kilograms per furnace.

    Second, the unequal technical level of cooperative members and the disparity in technical strength among cooperatives also affect the output of indigenous iron. The equipment level of the Cuntou Cooperative in Yunhe County and the Suichang Indigenous Iron Production Cooperative in Jinhua is not much different, but because the former has a higher technical level, the highest daily output per furnace is 1,000 kilograms; and for every 100 jin of iron smelted, it only consumes 200 jin of iron sand and 280 jin of charcoal. Due to the low technical level of the members of the Suichang Indigenous Iron Production Cooperative, the maximum daily output per furnace is only 450 kilograms; and for every 100 jin of indigenous iron smelted, it consumes 350 jin each of iron sand and charcoal.

    Third, most indigenous iron production units have very weak capital. This is also an important factor affecting the development of indigenous iron production. Because the main raw material for indigenous iron, iron sand, comes from farmers, who generally engage in mining during the slack farming season. The raw materials needed by iron production cooperatives throughout the year must be collected in full during the slack farming season. Many iron cooperatives have limited funds and cannot purchase raw materials for the entire year, often suspending work for several months each year. If the capital problem can be appropriately solved, indigenous iron production can be greatly increased.

    To fully utilize Zhejiang's indigenous iron resources to supply the needs of industrial production, the relevant industrial leading departments need to actively help solve the above-mentioned problems.

    浙江的土铁生产
    傅宝永　张唐
    在钢铁原料供应紧张的情况下，如何挖掘地方生产潜力，减轻钢铁原料供应紧张程度，保证部分产品的生产需要，是当前必须重视的问题。
    据调查，浙江省土铁的矿藏量有几千万吨。土铁生产约有三百年的历史。主要产地为温州、宁波、金华三个专区，其中以温州专区为最多，年产量约占全省的一半。
    过去浙江省土制农具的主要原料就是土铁。自从1955年外地废钢大量输入浙江以后，由于废钢价格低、加工容易，土铁销路大受影响，产量骤然下降。产量最多的云和县1955年比1954年减产10％；1956年又比1955年减产5％。于是有的领导部门便怀疑土铁的发展前途，对土铁生产采取放任自流的态度。
    今年在生铁原料供应不足的情况下，土铁生产引起了各方面的重视。但是目前土铁生产中，尚有不少问题。要发展土铁生产，领导部门必须着手解决这些问题。
    首先土铁生产设备落后、操作技术水平低，这是影响土铁生产发展的重要障碍。据九个生产较好的土铁生产合作社的调查，动力设备方面，只有两个社利用木炭引擎、一个社利用水力，其余的都用人力。据调查，用木炭引擎的平阳苕溪生产合作社，每天每炉铁的产量是六百五十公斤到七百五十公斤。用人力的瑞安高楼乡合作社，每天每炉产量只有三百公斤。
    其次，社员技术水平不等，各社之间技术力量配备悬殊，也影响了土铁的产量。云和县村头社和金华遂昌土铁生产合作社设备水平相差不大，但是由于前者技术水平较高，每天每炉最高产量有一千公斤；并且每炼一百斤铁，只要耗用铁砂二百斤、木炭二百八十斤。遂昌土铁生产合作社因社员技术水平低，每天每炉最多只能炼铁四百五十公斤；而且每炼一百斤土铁耗用的铁砂、木炭，各需三百五十斤。
    其三，大多数土铁生产的生产单位，资金都很薄弱。这也是影响土铁生产发展的重要因素。因为土铁的主要原料铁砂来自农民，农民一般都在农闲季节从事开采。铁业生产合作社全年所需的原料，要在农闲时节全部收足。许多铁业社资金较少，无法购买全年的原料，每年往往因此停工数月。如果资金问题能够适当解决，土铁就可增产许多。
    充分利用浙江的土铁资源，供应工业生产的需要，需要有关工业领导部门积极帮助解决上面提出的这些问题。
