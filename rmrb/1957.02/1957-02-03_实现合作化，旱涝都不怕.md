Achieving Cooperation, Fearing Neither Drought Nor Flood
      Zong Dexiang, Director of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative, Baicheng County, Jilin

    Our Dongfanghong Agricultural Production Cooperative is located in the famous "Eight Hundred Li Drought Sea" of Baicheng County, Jilin Province, where drought occurs nine years out of ten, with little rain and much wind. Although the western part of the cooperative is close to the Tao'er River, we do not get any benefit from irrigation, only water damage. Because the water level of the Tao'er River is abnormal, sometimes the river water dries up completely, and sometimes floods rise sharply, inundating cultivated land. In 1954 and 1955, although we had elementary cooperatives, we suffered from floods one year and drought the next. Each workday earned only 8 jiao in 1954 and 3 jiao in 1955.

    In 1956, the establishment of the advanced cooperative brought about a great change. First, we concentrated our efforts on water conservancy, digging 145 wells in one winter. With the addition of the original 48 wells, we overcame the spring drought last year. Between summer and autumn, the water level of the Tao'er River rose sharply. Seeing that more than 400 hectares of good crops were about to be flooded, we immediately concentrated 250 laborers and braved the wind and rain to rush repair a more than 400-meter-long dike to divert the water, and the flood was defeated. In addition, we changed the old cultivation methods in crop cultivation. In 1956, we achieved a bumper harvest that had not been seen in 20 years. The average annual yield here is 1,700 jin per hectare, and in 1956 the average yield of the entire cooperative reached 4,001 jin per hectare. In 1956, the total income of the cooperative was 220,000 yuan, and each workday earned more than 1.80 yuan. Among the 245 households in the cooperative, 97.5% of the members increased their income. The average net income per household was 650 yuan, and the average income per full laborer was 450 yuan.

    Our lives have changed greatly in just one year. Originally, the members did not have enough to eat or wear, and 70% of the households were in debt or had borrowed money from the state. Now, not only do we not worry about food and clothing, but we have also increased our means of production. In one year, we bought three rubber-tired carts capable of carrying 5,000 jin each, as well as 13 double-wheeled double-share plows, seeders, disc harrows, and 35 waterwheels. In addition, 30 new houses for members and 20 livestock sheds were built. Every member's home has glass windows installed. During the ten days of autumn, male and female members bought a total of 150 overcoats. Of the 308 male laborers in the cooperative, 275 already have overcoats. In general, members' income, after repaying state loans and buying necessities, is still not exhausted. 50% of the households have surplus funds deposited in the bank, with the highest deposit being 500 yuan.

    实现合作化，旱涝都不怕
      吉林白城县东方红农业社主任　宗德祥
    我们东方红农业生产合作社，处在吉林省白城县著名的“八百里旱海”上，十年九旱，风多雨少。社的西部虽靠近洮儿河，但是得不到一点水利，只有水害。因为洮儿河水位不正常，有时河水完全干涸，有时洪水猛涨，淹没耕地。1954年和1955年，我们虽然有了初级社，但一年涝、一年旱，每个劳动日1954年只分八角钱，1955年只分三角钱。
    1956年成立了高级社，情形就大不同了。我们首先集中力量兴修水利，一个冬天打了水井一百四十五眼，加上原有的四十八眼，去年的春旱就被我们战胜了。夏秋之间，洮儿河水位猛涨，眼看四百多垧好庄稼要被淹，我们当即集中了二百五十名劳力，冒着风雨抢修了四百多公尺长的一条顺水坝，堵住了洪水，涝灾又被我们战胜了。加上在作物栽培上改变了旧的耕作方法，1956年我们得到了二十年来没有过的丰收。我们这里的常年产量平均每垧是一千七百斤，1956年全社平均每垧地产量达到四千零一斤。1956年全社总收入是二十二万元；每个劳动日分一元八角多。全社二百四十五户社员，有97.5％的社员增加了收入。平均每户社员纯收入折款六百五十元；每个全劳力平均收入四百五十元。
    我们的生活在短短一年间就起了很大的变化。原来社员们吃的不足，穿的不够，70％的户都负债或借了国家的款。现在不仅吃穿不愁，还增加了不少生产资料。一年中买进了能载重五千斤的胶轮车三台、双轮双铧犁、播种机、圆盘耙等共十三台、水车三十五台；此外，新修社员住房三十间，畜舍二十间。每户社员家里都安上了玻璃窗。在秋季十几天当中，男女社员们就买了大衣共一百五十件。全社三百零八名男劳力，已有二百七十五人有了大衣。一般社员的收入除了归还国家贷款、买了生活必需品外还用不完，50％的户都有余资存入银行，最多的一户存了五百元。
