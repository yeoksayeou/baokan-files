Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 15th: The Communist Party Committees of various counties in Hunan Province have recently issued circulars to commend a large number of rural cadres. These rural cadres have made achievements in leading the winter production campaign in various agricultural cooperatives. Due to their outstanding work, the preparatory work for spring plowing has been rapidly launched in this province, which accounts for a large proportion of the country's rice production. The province has accumulated an average of more than 37 piculs of fertilizer per mu, and large and small water conservancy projects will be completed by the end of February and early March, creating conditions for striving to complete the task of reaching a total grain crop output of 24.5 billion jin in 1957 (an increase of 9.4% over the great harvest of 1955).

According to statistics from Xiangtan, Changde, Hengyang, and Shaoyang four special districts, and the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the 8,751 people who were commended were mostly secretaries and members of the general party branches of various townships, and township chiefs. Among them, more outstanding cadres emerged in the Changde Special District, with a total of 3,834 people commended in the region. Production work in this area has also been better promoted under the leadership of these outstanding cadres.

Since December of last year, tens of thousands of key rural cadres in various places have gone deep into various agricultural cooperatives, mobilized the masses, cultivated backbones, and lived, ate, and labored with the commune members, helping to solve specific difficulties. As a result, the production enthusiasm of the commune members has been greatly improved. Among the sixty-one general branch secretaries in Ningxiang County, fifty-four went to remote areas and agricultural cooperatives with more problems to help with their work, so that the average daily attendance rate in the county increased from 27% in December of last year to 78% in the past few days, and fertilizer accumulation increased from an average of 17 piculs per mu to 68 piculs. Winter water conservancy projects will also be completed by the end of February.

Among the cadres who were commended, some were recently transferred from leadership organs at various levels to work in the countryside. Of the 1,244 outstanding cadres commended in Hengyang Special District this time, 540 were newly transferred to the countryside. Luo Zefen, a Communist Party member, went to Xiatang Township in Leiyang County as soon as he was transferred there, and took charge of leading the Xinxin Agricultural Cooperative to build a reservoir. Last month, when the most important part of the reservoir project—the 58.2-meter-long culvert project—was completed and tested, water kept gushing out. Technicians suggested a complete rework. This would not only waste more than 800 workdays and more than 2,000 yuan, but more seriously, it would affect spring plowing production. Luo Zefen decided to check it first. So he took off his cotton coat and pants, and wore only a shirt and shorts, and went into the cave regardless of everything. He found that the stonemasons had cut corners, and the cement between the stones was too little, and in some places there was even no cement. When he crawled out of the cave, many places on his elbows and legs were scratched by the stones. Based on his suggestion, the culvert was repaired in only five days. The CPC Chen County Prefectural Committee issued a circular to commend his exemplary deeds.

### 出色的工作为今年大丰收创造了条件  湖南表扬大批优秀乡村干部

    出色的工作为今年大丰收创造了条件
    湖南表扬大批优秀乡村干部
    新华社长沙15日电　中共湖南省各县的委员会最近分别通报表扬了大批乡村干部。这些乡村干部在这次领导各农业社开展冬季生产运动上作出了成绩。由于他们出色的工作，已使这个稻谷产量占全国很大比重的省份的备耕工作迅速开展起来，全省平均每亩已积肥三十七担以上，大小水利工程将在2月底、3月初全部完工，为争取完成1957年粮食作物总产量达到二百四十五亿斤的任务（比大丰收的1955年增产9.4％）创造了条件。
    根据湘潭、常德、衡阳、邵阳等四个专区和湘西苗族自治州的统计，这次受到表扬的八千七百五十一人，大都是中共各乡总支书记、委员和乡长等干部。其中以常德专区涌现出来的优秀干部较多，全区共表扬了三千八百三十四人，这个地区的生产工作在这些优秀干部带动下也搞得较好。
    从去年12月以来，各地有成千上万的乡村主要干部纷纷深入各农业社，发动群众，培养骨干，并且和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，帮助解决具体困难问题，因而大大提高了社员们的生产热情。宁乡县六十一个乡总支书记中就有五十四人深入到偏僻地区和存在问题较多的农业社帮助工作，使这个县平均每天出工率从去年12月份的27％提高到前几天的78％，积肥从平均每亩十七担增加到六十八担，冬修水利工程也将在2月底全部完工。
    在这批受到表扬的干部中，有一部分是最近才从各级领导机关抽调下乡的。这次，衡阳专区表扬的一千二百四十四名优秀干部中，刚调下乡的就有五百四十人。共产党员罗泽芬刚调到耒阳县夏塘乡，就去领导新新农业社修建水库。上月份，这座水库工程最重要的部分——五八点二公尺长的涵洞工程完工后在试水时，里面的水直往外冒。技术人员提议全部返工。这样，不但要浪费八百多个工、二千多元钱，更严重的是要影响春耕生产。罗泽芬决定检查一下再说。于是他就脱下棉衣棉裤，只穿一件衬衣，一条短裤，不顾一切地钻到洞里去了。他发现原来是石工们偷工减料，在石块与石块的接头处，水泥糊得太少，有些地方甚至没有糊。当他从洞里爬出来时，肘上和腿上许多地方都被石块擦破了。根据他的建议，这条涵洞只花五天时间就整修好了。中共郴县地委会通报表扬了他的模范事迹。
