Correctly Implement the "Five Guarantees" System

In many advanced agricultural production cooperatives in most areas of our country, the "Five Guarantees" system is implemented for elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled members, guaranteeing food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial. The members who receive the "Five Guarantees" treatment say with emotion, "Parents are dear, but the cooperative is even dearer." This system has stimulated the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. They have personally witnessed the care of the socialist system for people, and they understand that as long as they work hard in the future, they will have a happy old age and no longer have to worry about old age, sickness, or disability.

However, the "Five Guarantees" system is, after all, only just beginning to be implemented. Various regions have encountered some problems in promoting this system, which need to be properly resolved.

First, who should enjoy the "Five Guarantees" treatment? This is clearly stipulated in the model charter of advanced agricultural production cooperatives. Only elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled cooperative members who lack labor power or have completely lost their labor power and have no means of support can enjoy the "Five Guarantees" treatment. Many agricultural cooperatives have implemented this regulation, and the effect has been very good. However, many agricultural cooperatives have also experienced excessive or lenient deviations when evaluating cooperative members who are eligible for the "Five Guarantees" treatment. For example, the Yangshan Township Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haifeng County, Guangdong Province, is a large cooperative with 645 households. In 1956, only two households enjoyed the "Five Guarantees" treatment. Later, after inspecting the living conditions of 70 cooperative member households, it was discovered that there were still six households that should have enjoyed the "Five Guarantees" treatment. It can be seen that the original provision of only two households enjoying the "Five Guarantees" treatment was too strict. On the other hand, some agricultural cooperatives have also included poor cooperative members with many people and little labor power, whose income is not enough to maintain their livelihoods, and cooperative members who are experiencing temporary difficulties as "Five Guarantees" recipients, which is of course very inappropriate.

There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first reason is that when determining the "Five Guarantees" recipients, the mass line working method was not adopted, and the masses were not mobilized to conduct evaluations, but rather a few cadres made subjective decisions. These grassroots cadres did not dare to mobilize the masses to discuss the issue, fearing that openly discussing this issue would foster the dependency mentality of some cooperative members. In fact, the less the masses are mobilized to discuss, the less supervision they receive when determining the list of recipients of the "Five Guarantees" treatment, and the more likely problems are to occur. Cooperative members who should enjoy the "Five Guarantees" treatment are even more worried about whether their lives are secure. In this way, how can the "Five Guarantees" work be done well?

The second reason is that some cooperative members use the "Five Guarantees" system as an excuse to arbitrarily separate from their parents and completely push the burden of supporting the elderly to the agricultural cooperative. This also creates some difficulties for agricultural cooperatives in appropriately determining "Five Guarantees" recipients. For example, the Aiguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, had 1,771 households before the wheat harvest in 1956, and increased to 1,808 households after the wheat harvest. The newly added 37 households were mostly elderly people abandoned by their sons. Those who arbitrarily separated from their parents said: "The family does not care about the elderly's lives, and the elderly can go to the cooperative to enjoy the Five Guarantees." Some of the people who say this are due to misunderstandings about the "Five Guarantees" system and the "distribution according to work" principle, while most are using it as an excuse to evade their due responsibilities. It should be pointed out that the behavior of these people who do not care about their parents' lives violates the morality of our people. Everyone has been raised by their parents since they were young, and everyone has the obligation to support their parents who have lost their ability to work after they reach adulthood. We oppose feudal blind loyalty and blind filial piety, and at the same time we advocate respecting and supporting the elderly. Anyone who violates this social morality and abandons their parents will not only be blamed by public opinion, but will also not be tolerated by the laws of the country.

Secondly, to what extent should the lives of helpless elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled cooperative members be guaranteed? This is also an issue that should be well resolved. Some agricultural cooperatives have set the "Five Guarantees" standards too high, so that the living standards of cooperative members enjoying this treatment exceed those of ordinary cooperative members, thus alienating them from the masses. Some agricultural cooperatives have set the standards too low, so that these cooperative members have encountered undue difficulties in their lives. These are all issues that cannot be ignored. Most advanced cooperatives have not been established for long. When stipulating the "Five Guarantees" standards, the living needs of these cooperative members and the ability of the agricultural cooperatives to bear the burden should be taken into account. In agricultural cooperatives that have been established for a long time and have better economic conditions, the lives of cooperative members enjoying the "Five Guarantees" treatment can be equivalent to the living standards of ordinary cooperative members. In some agricultural cooperatives that have been established for a shorter time and have poorer economic conditions, the level can also be appropriately lowered.

Among the cooperative members enjoying the "Five Guarantees" treatment, many are not completely without labor power. Agricultural cooperatives should allocate them some appropriate work according to their ability and help them develop household sideline occupations. In this way, their lives can be better, and the burden on agricultural cooperatives can be reduced. Some cadres of agricultural cooperatives one-sidedly believe that since these cooperative members enjoy the "Five Guarantees" treatment, they should not participate in production; if they participate in production, the "Five Guarantees" treatment should be cancelled. Therefore, some people used to pick up manure, raise pigs, graze sheep, collect firewood, and weave before enjoying the "Five Guarantees"; after enjoying the "Five Guarantees" treatment, they do nothing. This phenomenon is very abnormal. Advanced agricultural production cooperatives have many agricultural and sideline activities, and the division of labor is relatively detailed. They are fully capable of utilizing the semi-labor and auxiliary labor of these cooperative members. Of course, when arranging production for these cooperative members, it is absolutely forbidden to only reduce the burden on agricultural cooperatives and assign them too much or too heavy farm work.

The experience of implementing the "Five Guarantees" in various regions over the past year proves that it is entirely possible to correctly implement the "Five Guarantees" policy and properly arrange the production and lives of these cooperative members. Advanced cooperatives also have the strength to implement the "Five Guarantees," and the burden is not too heavy. According to statistics from agricultural cooperatives in Maoming County, Guangdong Province, the expenditure on the "Five Guarantees" accounts for about 20% of the public welfare fund. In eight agricultural cooperatives in Yongxing County, Hunan Province, the expenditure on the "Five Guarantees" accounts for 30% of the public welfare fund. Of course, some agricultural cooperatives are too poor to implement or fully implement the "Five Guarantees." Especially in some old revolutionary base areas and barren mountainous areas, due to long-term destruction by the enemy, due to low productivity, and due to the large number of families of martyrs and soldiers, the burden of preferential treatment labor days is very heavy, and there are still certain difficulties in implementing the "Five Guarantees." The "Five Guarantees" work in these areas should be carried out within their capacity. For agricultural cooperatives that are currently unable to implement or fully implement the "Five Guarantees" system, the local people's committees should continue to do a good job in social relief work to solve the difficulties of elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled cooperative members.

### 正确实行“五保”制度

    正确实行“五保”制度
    我国多数地区的许多高级农业生产合作社，对于老弱孤寡残疾的社员，实行了保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬的“五保”制度。受到了“五保”待遇的社员都感动地说：“爹亲，娘亲，不如社亲”。这个制度激发了广大农民的生产积极性，他们亲眼看到社会主义制度对人的关怀，他们懂得今后只要努力劳动，就有幸福的晚年，再不必为衰老、病残而担心了。
    但是，“五保”制度毕竟还只是开始实行，各个地区在推行这个制度的时候，都遇到一些问题，需要加以适当的解决。
    首先，什么人应当享受“五保”待遇？这在高级农业生产合作社示范章程中是明确规定了的。只有缺乏劳动力或者完全丧失了劳动力的、生活没有依靠的老弱孤寡残疾社员，才能享受“五保”待遇。很多农业社执行了这个规定，效果很好。但是，也有不少农业社在评定享受“五保”待遇的社员的时候，发生了过严或过宽的偏向。例如，广东省海丰县阳山乡高级农业生产合作社是一个六百四十五户的大社，1956年只有两户享受“五保”待遇。后来检查了七十户社员的生活状况，发现还有六户应该享受“五保”待遇。可见原先只规定两户享受“五保”待遇是过严了。在另一方面，也有一些农业社把人多劳动力少、收入不足维持生活的贫困社员和临时发生困难的社员，也列为“五保”对象，这当然也是很不妥当的。
    发生这种现象的原因有两个。第一个原因是在确定“五保”对象的时候，没有采取群众路线的工作方法，没有发动群众进行评议，而是由少数干部主观决定的。这些基层干部不敢发动群众进行讨论，他们害怕公开讨论这个问题，会助长某些社员的依赖思想。其实，越不发动群众讨论，在确定享受“五保”待遇的名单的时候，越得不到群众的监督，越可能发生毛病。应该享受“五保”待遇的社员，对于自己的生活有无保障的问题也越加担心。这样，怎么能够把“五保”工作做好呢？
    第二个原因是有些社员借口“五保”制度，随意和父母分家，而把老年人的生活完全推给农业社去负担。这也给农业社适当地确定“五保”对象造成一些困难。例如，山东省莒县爱国农业生产合作社在1956年麦收前有一千七百七十一户，麦收后增至一千八百零八户，这新增加的三十七户，大都是被儿子抛弃的老人。那些随意和父母分家的人说：“家里不管老年人的生活，老人可以到社里享受五保。”说这种话的人，有些是由于对“五保”制度和“按劳取酬”的分配原则发生了误解，而大多数却是借口逃避自己应尽的责任。应该指出，这些不管父母生活的人的行为，是违背我国人民道德的行为。我们每一个人在幼小的时候都受过父母的抚养，每一个人在成年以后也都有赡养丧失了劳动力的父母的义务。我们反对封建的愚忠愚孝，我们同时提倡尊老养老。谁如果违背了这种社会道德，遗弃了自己的父母，那不但要受到社会舆论的责备，而且是国家的法律所不容许的。
    其次，对于无依靠的老弱孤寡残疾社员的生活，究竟应该保证到什么程度？这也是应该很好地加以解决的问题。有些农业社把“五保”标准订得过高，使享受这种待遇的社员的生活水平超过了一般的社员，因而脱离了群众。也有些农业社把标准订得过低，以致这些社员的生活发生了不应有的困难。这都是不可忽视的问题。现在多数高级社都还建立不久，在规定“五保”标准的时候，应当兼顾这些社员的生活需要和农业社的负担能力。在那些建立时间较久、经济条件较好的农业社里，享受“五保”待遇的社员的生活可以相当于一般社员的生活水平。在一些建立时间较短、经济条件较差的农业社里，也可以适当放低水平。
    享受“五保”待遇的社员当中，有许多并非完全没有劳动力。农业社应该按照他们力之所能，给他们分配一些适当的工作，并且帮助他们开展家庭副业。这样，他们的生活可以过得好一些，农业社的负担也可以减轻一些。有些农业社的干部片面地认为这些社员既然享受“五保”待遇，就不应该参加生产；他们如果参加生产，就应该取消“五保”待遇。因此，有些人在没有享受“五保”以前，拾粪、养猪、放羊、拾柴、编织，能作许多事情；享受“五保”待遇以后，反而什么都不干了。这种现象很不正常。高级农业生产合作社的农业和副业活动很多，分工比较细致，完全有条件把这些社员的半劳动力和辅助劳动力运用起来。当然，在给这些社员安排生产的时候，也决不可只图减轻农业社的负担，而把过多、过重的农活分给他们。
    一年来各个地区实行“五保”的经验证明，正确地执行“五保”政策，妥善地安排这些社员的生产和生活是完全可能的。高级社也有力量实行“五保”，负担并不太重。据广东省茂名县的农业社统计，实行“五保”的开支约占公益金的20％。湖南省永兴县八个农业社“五保”的开支占公益金的30％。当然，也有一些农业社因为基础太差，无力实行或者无力全部实行“五保”。特别是某些革命老根据地和贫瘠山区，由于长期受到敌人摧残，由于生产力很低，加上烈属军属较多，优待劳动日负担很重，实行“五保”还有一定的困难。这些地区的“五保”工作应当量力而行。对于当前无力实行或无力全部实行“五保”制度的农业社，当地的人民委员会要继续做好社会救济工作，解决老弱孤寡残疾社员的困难。
