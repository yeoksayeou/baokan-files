    Not All Are Individualists
    Xing Huan
    Bloated organizations and overstaffing are long-standing problems. Why hasn't it been discovered in the past, allowing it to persist for so long? In fact, it’s not that it hasn’t been discovered, but that it hasn’t been properly resolved. Some people who have nothing to do, who are extremely bored, have raised objections more than once, but the result has been very bad. They often encounter a hat of "individualism" or "not being content with their work," which is used to suppress those who raise objections. Consider the following facts:
    In the Private Industry and Commerce Transformation Office of the Jilin Provincial Department of Industry, several comrades have had little to do, some being idle for more than two years. Everyone is very dissatisfied with this situation. Some comrades feel that it is not right to take wages for nothing and have requested transfers from their superiors. The leadership neither accepts the opinions of the cadres nor studies the problems in their work, but uses such a hat to suppress them. Thus, the situation becomes calm, and the problem of overstaffing seems to have been resolved.
    In the Statistics Group of the Planning and Statistics Section of the Northwest Second Engineering Company, there were only two people in the first quarter of last year. They completed their work and did it in an organized manner. In the second quarter, without any increase in tasks, two more people were added, and in September and October, two more were added. As a result, these comrades were often forced to "rest." However, it is distressing for good people to "rest" there without working. Comrade Li Xinfeng in this group could not bear it any longer. He went to the manager, the section chief, and the cadre section, making oral requests and written reports: requesting more work to do. However, the result of Li Xinfeng's suggestion was not a reasonable adjustment of his work, but being labeled as "individualistic" and "disobeying the organization," receiving criticism from the section chief and advice from the Communist Youth League group (later, due to his repeated insistence, the leadership transferred him out, but the problem of overstaffing in this group was not resolved – note).
    A conscious revolutionary cadre always hopes to do more work for the country and the people. Who would be willing to waste their precious years playing chess, playing cards, and chatting? Since they cannot be content with "eating the people's food without doing things for the people," they must raise objections to the leadership, requesting more work or requesting to be placed in more needed places.
    For those who raise such legitimate demands, indiscriminately slapping them with a hat of "individualism"—what will be the result besides frustrating the enthusiasm of these comrades? If the purpose of these leaders is to turn cadres into mediocre people who only eat and do nothing, they would certainly cry injustice and say: We only want the cadres to be "content." However, how exactly can cadres be made "content," and what should they be content to do? They rarely consider this. They tend to consider their own or their unit's "convenience." Because although these cadres are indeed "prepared but not used," "an army raised for a thousand days is meant to be used for one moment"! It would be much easier to use them when the time comes. Hoarding cadres in this way is genuine departmentalism. Take a look! Who should be criticized?
    However, among those who are dissatisfied with the current work situation and raise objections, some are indeed restless and creating trouble. For such people, we should of course criticize their individualism, but in criticizing them, we should not simply and crudely put hats on them, but replace it with in-depth and meticulous ideological education.

    并不都是个人主义者
    星环
    机构臃肿，人浮于事是一个早已存在的问题。为什么过去一直没有发现，使它长久地存在下来呢？事实上，不是没有发现，而是得不到正确的解决。有些没有事干、闲得发慌的人不止一次地提过意见，但是，结果却很不好。往往会遇到一顶“个人主义”“不安心工作”的帽子，把提意见的人压回来。请看以下事实：
    吉林省工业厅对私营工商业改造办公室有几位同志，由于事少人多，有的人已经闲了二年多了，对于这种情况，大家很不满意。有的同志感到白拿工薪对不起人民，向领导上提出调动工作的要求。领导上既不接受干部的意见，也不研究工作中的问题，就用这样的帽子一压，于是风平浪静，人浮于事的问题好像已经解决了。
    西北第二工程公司计划统计处的统计组，去年第一季度只有两个人，工作任务也完成了，而且做得很有条理。第二季度并没有增加什么任务，却增加了两个人，到9、10月份又增加了两个。这样一来，这几个同志就不能不经常被迫“休息”。但是，好好的人不工作而在那里“休息”是很叫人难过的。这个组的李鑫峰同志熬不住了，他找经理，找处长，找干部科，口头申请，书面报告：要求多做工作。可是，李鑫峰提意见的结果，不是合理地调整他的工作，而是被戴上了“个人主义”、“不服从组织”的帽子，受到处长的批评和团小组的劝告（后来，由于他一再坚持，领导上把他调出去了，但这个组人浮于事的问题并未解决——注）。
    一个有觉悟的革命干部，总是希望能够尽力为国家、为人民多做一些工作。谁甘愿把大好年华虚度在下棋、打扑克牌和谈天说地上？既然不能甘心于“白吃人民的饭不给人民做事”，就得找领导提意见，要求多做一点工作，或者要求把自己放到更需要的地方去。
    对于提这样的正当要求的人，不分青红皂白地扣上一顶“个人主义”的帽子。这除去挫折了这些同志的积极性以外，还会有什么结果呢？如果说这些领导人的目的就是要叫干部变成庸庸碌碌只吃饭不做事的人，那他们一定会大叫冤枉说：我们只不过是要干部“安心”而已。但是，究竟怎样才能叫干部“安心”，安下心来做什么？他们却很少考虑。他们偏重于考虑自己或本单位的“方便”。因为尽管这些干部确实是“备而不用”，但“养兵千日，用兵一时”啊！有朝一日要用起来就顺手得多。像这样地囤积干部，这就是真正的本位主义。看看吧！究竟是谁该受批评！
    不过，在那些对现在的工作状况不满而提意见的人中，有些人确实是不安心工作而在那里闹情绪的。对于这样的人，当然应当批评他的个人主义，但是，在批评时，也还是不要简单粗暴地戴帽子，而应代之以深入细致的思想教育。
