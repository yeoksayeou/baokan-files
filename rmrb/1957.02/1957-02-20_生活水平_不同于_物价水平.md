	"Living Standards" are Different from "Price Levels"

	In newspapers, we often see the terms "living standards" and "price levels" being used interchangeably. For example, the article "Cooperative for Employees' Families" on page 2 of the People's Daily on January 19th said: "The average salary of more than 60% of workers is a little over forty yuan, and coupled with the relatively high local living standards, there are many households facing difficulties." It is evident that the phrase "relatively high living standards" here actually refers to "relatively high price levels." We hope that authors and editors will pay attention to the usage of these two terms. (Wan Peirui, Peking University)

### “生活水平”不同于“物价水平”

    “生活水平”不同于“物价水平”
    在报纸上时常看到把生活水平一词和物价水平一词的用法混淆起来的现象。例如1月19日人民日报第二版“职工家属合作社”一文中说：“60％以上的工人平均工资是四十元多一点，加上当地生活水平较高，困难户比较多。”显而易见，这里说的“生活水平较高”，实际上是指的“物价水平较高”。希望作者和编者对这两个词的用法注意一下。　（北京大学　万培瑞）
