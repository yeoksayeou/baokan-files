    "Document Company"
    I am a county company manager. Every morning, the clerk sends me a large stack of documents, including notices and instructions, covering everything. Upon opening them, I find the text lengthy, encompassing everything from grand principles to specific issues. I asked the clerk to calculate that, apart from confidential documents and documents from local Party and government and related units at the same level, the ordinary documents from the superior company alone, from October 3rd to November 3rd of last year, totaled one hundred and sixty-two. How enthusiastic the superior company is in guiding the work of subordinate units, and how earnest its education is! The subordinate must, of course, respectfully accept the teachings, and thus spends every day buried in piles of documents, unable to escape. One day, a comrade came to the manager's office and asked: "Manager, are we a county-level monopoly company, or a document company?" This question shocked me and left me speechless.　Query

    “文件公司”
    我是一个县公司经理。每天上午，文书送给我一大堆文件，有通知，有指示，面面俱全。打开一看，只见文字冗长，从大道理到具体问题，无所不包。我请文书同志计算了一下，除了机密文件、当地党政和同级有关单位的文件以外，仅仅上级公司来的普通文件自去年10月3日到11月3日止，就有一百六十二件。上级公司对下属单位的业务指导是多么的热情，教育是多么的恳切啊！下级当然要恭恭敬敬地领教，于是每天钻在文件堆里，跳都跳不出来。有一天，经理室来了一个同志，问道：“经理，我们是县级的专卖公司，还是文件公司？”这一问，弄得我心惊肉跳，无话可答。　咨文
