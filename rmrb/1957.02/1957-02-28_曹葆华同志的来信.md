To the Editor:

Comrade Zhou Xi's criticism of my translation of "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" is generally correct. I should thank him here for pointing out the errors and shortcomings in my translation.

I have translated this classic work twice. The first time was in 1945-1946, and the manuscript was burned by the enemy when we evacuated Wayaobao in northern Shaanxi. The second time was in 1948, when I lived in a village near Shijiazhuang. At that time, I was translating it alone. Some industrial and agricultural terms, due to my lack of knowledge in this area and no one to consult, were copied from existing terms in the Japanese translation (for example, "full workers," "semi-workers," "strong semi-workers," "weak semi-workers," "presses," "severe injuries," "drums," "drummers," "winders"). In addition, I had the following shortcomings in my translation work at that time: I tried my best to directly translate each sentence according to the order of the Russian words (for example, "The factory should follow the weavers to those villages..."), and each noun had to be translated the same way throughout (for example, "工艺" [gongyi - craft/technology]), instead of appropriately translating the meaning from its content. As for the expression of Chinese words and sentences, the effort of deliberation and refinement was also far from enough.

After entering Beijing in 1949, this book has been printed four times. Although some changes have been made to the words and sentences each time (mainly related to theoretical and statistical figures), because I have not heard any unsatisfactory reactions, I presumptuously thought that my translation was not a big problem, and I did not make an effort to make a thorough revision. Now, facing these shortcomings and errors, I certainly feel deeply ashamed of this great classic work, and I have also let down the vast number of readers in our country.

In the future, I have decided either to carefully revise the translation word by word against the original work myself, or to thoroughly re-translate this book together with others upon invitation, so that the translation of this classic work can be of some help to comrades who study political economics.　With best regards,
                               Cao Baohua

    曹葆华同志的来信
    编辑同志：
    周熙同志对我所译的“俄国资本主义的发展”一书的批评，一般是正确的。在这里应当感谢他把我的译文的错误和缺点指了出来。
    这部经典著作，我先后翻译过两次。第一次是在1945——1946年，译稿在撤离陕北瓦窑堡的时候被敌人焚毁了。第二次是在1948年，住在石家庄附近乡村的时候。当时我是独自一个人翻译的，有些工业和农业上的术语，由于自己缺乏这方面的知识而又无从向人请教，都是从日译本中现有的名词抄录下来的（例如，“完全工人”，“半工人”，“大力半工人”，“小力半工人”，“压榨机”，“重伤症”，“鼓”，“鼓手”，“卷丝者”）。另外，当时我在翻译工作上还有着这样的缺点，就是每句话都是尽量顺着俄文词儿的次序直译出来（例如，“工厂应当跟着织工走到那些村落中去……”），每个名词都要前后译成一样（例如“工艺”），而不从其内容上恰当地把意思翻译出来。至于在中文词句的表达上，推敲和琢磨的工夫也是下得很不够的。
    1949年进北京后，此书印行过四次，虽然每次也都在字句上作了一些改动（主要是有关理论和统计数字方面的），但是由于没有听到什么不满的反应，所以就妄自认为自己的译文没有多大问题了，也就没有努力去作彻底的修改。现在面对着这些缺点和错误，我当然深深感到有愧于这部伟大的经典著作，而且也有负于我国广大的读者。
    今后我决定或者自己对着原著逐字逐句仔细地把译文校改一遍，或者在邀请别人合作之下共同把此书彻底改译一次，务求这部经典著作的译文对于研究政治经济学的同志们能有一些帮助。　此致敬礼　
                               曹葆华
