Improving the Official Document System, Appropriately Decentralizing Power
The Number of Official Documents and Telegrams of the General Administration of Customs Decreases Year by Year

(Reported by this newspaper) The number of official documents and telegrams in the General Administration of Customs system has decreased year by year. According to statistics: In 1954, there were 13,352 pieces; in 1955, there were 9,375 pieces; and in 1956, there were 6,898 pieces. Along with the decrease in official documents and telegrams, there has also been a reduction in personnel. The authorized staff of the General Administration of Customs was 335 in 1954, and it has been reduced to 179 in 1956.

At the beginning of the establishment of the People's Customs, due to the unfamiliarity of the staff with the new customs business, it was somewhat difficult to handle specific issues according to policy principles. At the same time, major regulations and laws were being drafted and implemented one after another. Local customs offices had to maintain consistency in the methods of inspecting and releasing goods, passenger luggage, and means of transport entering and leaving the country. Moreover, everyone had a habit of handling affairs based on documents and official seals, so the requests and reports from port customs to the General Administration of Customs were very numerous.

In order to change this situation of rampant bureaucracy, the General Administration of Customs first formulated a number of separate measures based on the established policies and in combination with some of the problems frequently encountered in the actual work of various port customs, and based on the relevant basic laws and regulations that had already been formulated and promulgated, so that port customs had something to follow in their work. This reduced a lot of official documents and telegrams where the lower level asks and the higher level answers.

In the past, the General Administration of Customs managed the lower levels too much and too rigidly. Port customs almost asked for instructions on everything, and the General Administration of Customs almost always replied to every document received. In order to change this situation, the General Administration of Customs gradually expanded the powers of lower-level organs. For example, some implementation measures formulated by various customs offices based on the laws, instructions, and regulations promulgated by the central government and in combination with the port situation, as well as the internal business systems of various customs offices, could be handled by the port customs themselves without having to ask for instructions and report on everything. This not only directly helps to overcome bureaucracy, but also plays a very good role in giving play to the enthusiasm of various port customs and improving their sense of responsibility.

The General Administration of Customs also paid attention to improving handling procedures and the official document system. When dealing with problems, oral and telephone solutions are used instead of official documents whenever possible; official document procedures are not supplemented unless necessary; simple problems are answered with a "simple reply form"; documents that do not need to be kept are handled by returning the original document with instructions or forwarding the original document to the relevant unit, without issuing a separate document; documents unrelated to customs business are returned to the issuing unit; simple inquiries and replies are made with informal letters. These measures have all played a good role in overcoming bureaucracy.

### 改进公文制度　权力适当下放  海关总署公文函电逐年减少

    改进公文制度　权力适当下放
    海关总署公文函电逐年减少
    本报讯　海关总署系统的公文函电逐年减少。据统计：1954年为一万三千三百五十二件，1955年为九千三百七十五件，1956年为六千八百九十八件。同公文函电减少的同时是人员的减少，海关总署编制人员1954年为三百三十五人，1956年已减至一百七十九人。
    人民海关建立之初，由于工作人员对新海关的业务不熟，根据政策原则处理具体问题有些困难；同时，主要的章则法令正在陆续拟订实施，各地海关对进出国境的货物、旅客行李和运输工具的查验放行办法又必须一致，而且大家有看文件凭印章办事的习惯，所以口岸海关向海关总署的请示报告十分繁多。
    海关总署为了改变这种文牍泛滥的情况，首先根据既定的政策结合各口岸海关实际工作中经常碰到的一些问题，在已经制定颁布的有关的基本法令的基础上，陆续制定了若干单行办法，使口岸海关在工作中有所遵循。这样就减少了很多下边一问上边一答的公文函电。
    过去，海关总署对下级管得过多过死。口岸海关几乎无事不请示，海关总署也几乎是来文必批复。为了改变这种局面，海关总署逐步地扩大了下级机关的职权。如各关根据中央公布的法令、指示、规章结合口岸情况所制定的某些实施办法、各关内部业务制度等，都可以由口岸海关自行处理，不必逐事请示报告。这不仅直接有助于克服文牍主义，而且对发挥各口岸海关的积极性、提高他们的责任心也起了很好的作用。
    海关总署还注意了改进办事手续和公文制度。在处理问题时，能口头和电话解决的就不用公文；不是必要的时候不要补办公文手续；问题比较简单的用“简复单”答复；没有留存必要的文件用原件批回或原件转有关单位的办法处理，不另发文；来文同海关业务无关的退回发文单位；简单问题的查询和答复用便函。这些办法对克服文牍主义都有很好的作用。
