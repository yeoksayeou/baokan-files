	Each time I close my eyes, I seem to hear the sound of his heart beating.

	One summer night, I left the hotel in Leningrad after a short three-day stay.

	It was late, but the night was not dark. The stern buildings, the elegant spires, the rows of linden trees, and the flat stone roads were all draped in a layer of silver-blue, soft light. The gently flowing Neva River seemed to be whispering sweet nothings to the clear blue night sky. The lights on the boats reflected in the heart of the river, creating golden dragon-like reflections... I was lost in thought. I seemed to hear the hurried footsteps of Comrade Lenin, I seemed to hear the cannon fire of 1917 announcing the arrival of spring for the working people of the world, and I seemed to see the people here struggling through the thousand days of the fascist German siege... I stood on the banks of the Neva, bidding farewell to this heroic city.

	"Friend, are you saying goodbye to Leningrad?" I thought I was asking myself in my thoughts, but the voice repeated itself. I turned around, and before me was an unfamiliar but friendly face.

	"You're from China, aren't you? Am I disturbing you?" Then he introduced himself: "My name is Oleg." Then he began a general conversation.

	He suddenly pulled out a copper box for tobacco, wrapped in a flowered bag, opened it, and offered it to me.

	"Thank you, I don't smoke," I said.

	"It's not tobacco, take a sniff," he said, his hand holding the tobacco box still raised in front of me.

	To my surprise, the box contained soil, ordinary, dried soil. I looked at him strangely. He smiled.

	"Don't the Chinese have a saying: 'On festive occasions more than ever one thinks of one's dear ones'?" he said. "Today, according to our calendar, is the Mid-Autumn Festival. Although there isn't a jade-like full moon like in China, it still makes me think of my loved ones!"

	His words aroused my great interest, and I asked him:

	"Are your relatives in China?"

	He shook his head, then nodded again.

	"In 1945, I spent an unforgettable Mid-Autumn Festival in a poor little village in China. At that time, I was seriously injured..." he said slowly. The summer night wind, carrying the fragrance of lilacs, accompanied by the ripples of the Neva River, seemed to be composing music for his words. But he only said this one sentence and stopped. In the dim light, I saw him squinting, looking east, as if looking to the end of the river, perhaps even further, towards my hometown. His words led me into reverie. He remained silent for a long time. I didn't want to break this deeply affectionate silence, waiting for him to continue. "Once the topic is brought up, it becomes a long story. In short, when I was seriously injured, a Chinese peasant family saved me. When I left, in front of his dilapidated mud house, I grabbed a handful of soil, put it in this tobacco box, and brought it back... to forever commemorate them, to commemorate our Chinese loved ones." He himself smelled the soil in the box again, and said excitedly:

	"How fragrant!"

	He very carefully put the tobacco box away, and then asked with infinite concern about the lives of the peasants in Northeast China, asked about the size of the sorghum ears, asked about everything.

	We forgot about the time, and the eastern half of the sky was almost dawning.

	"Leningrad is really lovely, I really hate to leave it!"

	"Everyone loves it, I'm a Leningrad native, of course I love it even more. Tonight I also came to the riverbank to say 'goodbye' to it, and unexpectedly met you."

	"Where are you going?"

	"To reclaim wasteland!" In his firm tone was an indescribable joy.

	Leningrad is indeed lovely, but what is most lovely is that there are people like this here. They love their hometown, so they hope that every corner of the motherland is as lovely as their hometown; they love the people of the motherland, so they hope that the working people of the world are as happy as they are.

	I reached out to shake his hand, but unexpectedly he gave me his left hand. Perhaps he sensed my surprise, so he immediately explained: "I lost my right hand when I was wounded in the liberation of Northeast China." Only then did I realize that his right sleeve was tucked into his pocket and had not moved the whole time.

	I grew up in Northeast China, and I know the tragic life of the people of Northeast China under the rule of Japanese imperialism, and I personally experienced the joy when the Soviet army liberated Northeast China. The Chinese people will always remember the Soviet people as their loved ones. Now, in front of him, how should I thank him for his brotherly friendship? I tightly grasped his only hand, so moved that I couldn't say a word. But he put his arm around my neck and kissed me warmly for a long time. I wanted to thank him with the most sincere words of the Chinese people, but something choked in my throat.

	"Don't be sad for me for having only one hand left," he said. "If the Chinese brothers and sisters need me to dedicate my other hand, I will not hesitate in the slightest, because..." He pulled open his left lapel, put my hand on his chest, and said: "...because I have a sound heart like the 200 million Soviet people!"

	Each time I close my eyes, I always clearly hear the sound of his heart beating.

	"On festive occasions more than ever one thinks of one's dear ones"—what a deeply affectionate and meaningful Chinese saying!

	Oleg! I don't know where you are today, but I am sure that you, like us who miss the Soviet people, are missing your Chinese loved ones!

    心
    乌兰汗
    每次，当我阖起眼睛的时候，我就仿佛听到他的心跳动的声音。
    在一个夏季的夜里，我走出了短留三日的列宁格勒的旅馆。
    夜深了，可是夜色并不黑暗。严峻的楼房、秀挺的塔尖、成排的菩提树、平坦的石块路都披上了一层银蓝色的、柔和的薄光。涓涓的涅瓦河水好像在跟澄蓝的夜空缠绵私语。船艇上的灯火在河心里映照出一条条金龙般的倒影……。我，陷入沉思。我仿佛听见了列宁同志急促的脚步声，我仿佛听见了1917年寒冬宣布世界劳动人民的春天已降临的炮声，我也仿佛看到了这儿的人民在法西斯德国围困时艰苦奋斗的一千天……。我站在涅瓦河畔，和这座英雄城市告别。
    “朋友，在和列宁格勒告别吗？”我以为是自己在沉思中问自己，可是声音又重复了一遍。我回过头去，眼前是一副陌生的、但是亲切的面孔。
    “您是从中国来的吧？我不会打搅您吗？”然后他做了自我介绍：“我叫奥列格。”随即开始了一般的谈话。
    他突然掏出一个套在花袋子里的装烟丝的铜盒，打开来拿给我。
    “谢谢，我不会吸烟。”我说。
    “不是烟丝，您闻一闻。”他那只托着烟盒的手，仍然举在我的面前。
    出乎我的意外，烟盒里装的是土，普通的、干了的土。我奇怪的望着他。他笑了。
    “中国人不是有一句谚语嘛：每逢佳节倍思亲。”他说，“今天按我们的日历是中秋，天上虽然没有中国那样一轮白玉般的满月，可是仍然让我思亲呀！”
    他的话引起我很大的兴趣，我问他：
    “您的亲人在中国吗？”
    他摇了摇头，然后又点了点头。
    “1945年，我在中国的一个贫穷的小村子里，度过了一个难忘的中秋节。那时我负了重伤……”他慢慢地讲着。夏夜的风含着丁香花的馥郁，伴着?瓦河的微波，仿佛为他的话谱着曲。但，他仅说了这一句便停住了。在朦胧中，我看见他眯缝着眼睛，望着东面，似乎在望河的尽头，也许是更远更远的地方，望着我的家乡。我被他的话引入遐想。他沉默很久不语。我不肯打破这情意深长的寂静，等他说下去。“话一提起来，就长了。总之，在重伤时，一家中国农民救了我。临别时，我在他破陋的泥巴房前，抓了一把土，装在这个烟盒里，带回来了……为了永远纪念他们，纪念我们的中国亲人。”他自己又闻了闻这盒土，激动地说：
    “多么香呵！”
    他非常珍重地把烟盒收起来，然后便无限关切地问起东北农民的生活，问道高粱穗的大小，问到一切一切。
    我们忘记了时间，东半天已经快破晓了。
    “列宁格勒实在可爱，真舍不得离开它！”
    “每个人都爱它，我是列宁格勒人，当然更爱它。今夜我也是来到河畔和它说一声‘再见’的，意外地遇见了您。”
    “您准备到哪儿去呢？”
    “去开荒！”在他的坚定的语气里，蕴藏着难于形容的欢欣。
    列宁格勒实在可爱，但最可爱的是因为这儿有这样的人。他们热爱自己的家乡，所以希望祖国每个角落都和家乡一样的可爱；他们热爱祖国人民，所以希望世界的劳动人民都和他们一样的幸福。
    我伸出手来跟他握别，不料他却把左手伸给了我。也许他感觉到了我的诧异，所以立刻做了解释：“那次在解放东北负伤时，我失去了右手。”只是这时，我才发觉他的右袖筒插在衣兜里，一直没有动。
    我在东北长大，我知道东北人民在日本帝国主义统治时期的悲惨生活，我也亲自感受到苏军解放了东北时的欢乐。中国人民把苏联人民当作亲人永远记在心里了。如今，在他的面前，应当怎样感激他的兄弟情谊呢？我紧握着他那仅有的一只手，激动得说不出一个字来。他却一把抱住了我的脖颈，长时间地、热烈地吻着。我愿用中国人最赤诚的话来感谢他，但是不知什么东西哽住了喉咙。
    “你不要为我剩下一只手而难过。”他开了口，“如果中国兄弟姊妹还需要我献出另一只手的时候，我决不会有丝毫的犹豫，因为……”他拉开了左襟，把我的手按在他的胸前，说：“……因为我有一颗和两万万苏联人民一样的健全的心！”
    每次，当我阖上眼睛的时候，我总会清清楚楚地听到他的心跳动的声音。
    “每逢佳节倍思亲”——这是一句情意多么浓厚、意味多么深长的中国老话呀！
    奥列格！我不知道你今天在什么地方，但是，我确信，你和我们思念苏联人民一样，在思念着中国的亲人！
