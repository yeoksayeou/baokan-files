    Hunan Liling, Hengshan, and Ten Other Counties
    Nearly a Thousand Agricultural Cooperatives Strive to Become "Thousand-Jin Cooperatives"
    (Our newspaper reporter Huang Yubai reports) From the beginning of February to February 20th, sixty-nine counties in Hunan Province have successively convened enlarged county-level cadre meetings. During the meetings, each county engaged in heated discussions, formulated agricultural and sideline production plans for this year, proposed a series of measures to increase production, and studied how to strengthen leadership over agricultural production. Liling County, a renowned double-cropping rice production area, decided to continue to carry out the "Thousand-Jin High-Yield Movement," planting double-cropping rice on 94% of the county's paddy fields, striving to increase rice production by 26% compared to last year. Shaoyang and Hengyang prefectures, which suffered severe droughts last year, both proposed striving to increase production by more than 10% compared to 1955. The Changde area, located on the shores of Dongting Lake, plans to increase rice production by 13% compared to last year. Wangcheng County, a well-known pig-producing area, plans to raise 530,000 pigs, an average of more than five pigs per person, an increase of 33.1% compared to 1956. According to statistics from only ten counties, including Liling, Hengshan, Xiangtan, and Wangcheng, nearly a thousand agricultural cooperatives have proposed striving to become "Thousand-Jin High-Yield Cooperatives."
    This year, Hunan Province has particularly strengthened ideological work in organizing the great production movement. In Shaodong County, which suffered the most severe drought last year, some township and cooperative cadres, when discussing this year's production plan, believed that there were too many difficulties and doubted whether production could be increased this year; some even planned to reduce or not plant double-cropping rice. The meeting analyzed the real reasons for the decline in grain production in recent years, believing that the severe drought last year and shortcomings in the management of agricultural cooperatives had indeed brought many problems to this year's production. However, there were still many favorable conditions for striving for a good harvest this year. More than 70% of the county's winter water conservancy projects had been completed, greatly improving this year's drought resistance capacity. Seed grain supplies had been prepared, and although fertilizer accumulation and plowing were worse than at the same time last year, there were still more than a month from now until Qingming to address these issues. Township and cooperative cadres throughout the county already had a year of experience in leading agricultural cooperatives in production, coupled with the urgent desire of the broad masses of farmers to develop production. As long as they worked hard, fully utilized the superiority of advanced cooperatives, and used all favorable conditions, difficulties could be completely overcome. In accordance with this spirit, the meeting planned to increase grain crop production in the county by 10% compared to 1955. After repeated discussions and calculations at the enlarged cadre meeting in Hengshan County, the three townships of Dianmenqian, Nanyue, and Bailiansi proposed plans to strive to achieve "Thousand-Jin High-Yield Townships." In addition, ninety cooperatives and six hundred and ten teams from four hundred and thirty cooperatives respectively proposed plans to achieve "Thousand-Jin Cooperatives" and "Thousand-Jin Teams."
    Counties that held meetings earlier have already conveyed the spirit of the meetings to townships and cooperatives. At the same time, all parts of the province are continuing to transfer cadres to the countryside to strengthen grassroots leadership. Many counties have selected different types of key production areas, assigned cadres to these areas, strengthened leadership, and used the method of key demonstrations to drive the overall production and improve production.

    湖南醴陵、衡山等十个县
    近千个农业社争取成为千斤社
    本报讯　本报记者黄驭白报道：湖南省从2月上旬起到2月20日止已有六十九个县先后召开了县的扩大干部会。各县在会议上经过热烈的讨论，制定了今年的农副业生产计划，提出了一系列的增产措施，并研究了加强对农业生产的领导问题。著名的双季稻产区醴陵县，决定继续开展千斤丰产运动，在全县94％的水田都种上双季稻；稻谷产量争取比去年增加26％。去年旱灾严重的邵阳、衡阳两专区均提出争取在1955年的基础上增产一成以上。洞庭湖滨的常德地区计划水稻比去年增产13％。著名的生猪产地望城县，计划养猪五十三万头，平均每人养猪五头多，比1956年增加33.1％。仅据醴陵、衡山、湘潭、望城等十个县统计，有近千个农业社提出要争取成为粮食千斤丰产社。
    今年湖南各地在组织大生产运动中，特别加强了思想工作。邵东县去年受旱最重，部分乡社干部在讨论今年生产计划时，认为困难太多，对今年能否增产有怀疑，有的还打算少种或不种双季稻。会议上分析了几年粮食减产的真正原因，认为由于去年遭受大旱和农业社经营管理工作上的缺点，的确给今年生产带来了不少问题。但是争取今年丰收的有利条件还是很多，全县水利冬修已完成70％以上，大大提高了今年的抗旱能力。种谷供应已作了准备，其他积肥、犁田工作虽然比去年同时期差，但是从现在起到清明还有一个多月，可以抓紧解决。全县乡、社干部已有了一年的领导农业社进行生产的经验，加上广大农民发展生产的迫切要求，只要经过艰苦的工作，充分发挥高级社的优越性，利用一切有利条件，困难是完全可以克服的。会议根据这一精神，计划全县粮食作物比1955年增产10％。衡山县在扩大干部会上经过反复讨论算账，有店门前、南狱和白莲寺三个乡提出了争取实现千斤丰产乡的计划。此外，还有九十个社和四百三十个社的六百一十个队，分别提出了实现千斤社和千斤队的计划。
    会议开得较早的县，已经将会议精神贯彻到乡和社。与此同时，全省各地正在继续抽调干部下乡，加强基层领导力量。许多县都选定了不同类型的生产重点，在这些点上配备干部，加强领导，用重点示范的办法，带动全面，搞好生产。
