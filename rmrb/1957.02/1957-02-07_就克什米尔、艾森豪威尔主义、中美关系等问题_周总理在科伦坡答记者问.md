Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 5th (Delayed Dispatch) Premier Zhou Enlai said this afternoon in Colombo, answering questions from reporters, that China does not approve of sending UN troops to Kashmir. He said: This is because China has always believed that submitting the Kashmir issue to the United Nations will not yield any good results.

The press conference held by Premier Zhou Enlai lasted for a total of one hour, attended by approximately twenty Sri Lankan and foreign journalists.

Western countries are using the Kashmir issue to create conflict between India and Pakistan in an attempt to divert world attention from the Middle East.

China will continue to work to encourage India and Pakistan to seek a peaceful solution to the Kashmir issue themselves.

Continuing to answer questions about Kashmir, Premier Zhou warned that Western countries are currently using the Kashmir issue to create conflict between India and Pakistan. "Their aim is to sow seeds of discord among Asian countries in an attempt to divert world attention from the Middle East."

He called for Asian countries to unite. He said: "Only when Asian countries are united in the spirit of the Bandung Conference can they build their countries and get rid of the backwardness caused by colonialism."

He said that he had appealed to India and Pakistan, asking them to seek a peaceful solution to the Kashmir issue themselves.

When a reporter asked about the results of his efforts in this regard, he said that neither India nor Pakistan had rejected his call for direct negotiations between the two countries. He pointed out that achieving this would take time. "It is precisely because this matter is difficult that we are making efforts to facilitate its resolution, rather than allowing Western countries to use the Kashmir issue to create discord."

He said that this issue had already been raised in the joint statement issued today by the Chinese Premier and the Sri Lankan Prime Minister. "We will continue to work."

Eisenhower's policy towards the Middle East will not have good results.

Israel's refusal to withdraw its troops from Egypt is another trick by Western countries to facilitate their intervention in the region in another way.

When a reporter asked Zhou Enlai for his opinion on the Eisenhower Doctrine, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "In a word, Eisenhower's policy towards the Middle East will not have good results."

He said that even before the Eisenhower Doctrine was announced, he had said at a press conference in India that "the United States' aim is to replace Britain and France in the Middle East." He said that this was proven by Eisenhower's special message and reports in Indian newspapers.

Zhou Enlai said that foreign aid needed by countries engaged in construction would be welcomed by Asian countries, including China, provided that such aid was sincere and did not come with conditions. He said that aid provided in order to obtain privileges, to establish military bases, and to make recipient countries join military blocs would not be welcomed by the people. Such aid might have some effect for a period of time, but eventually it would reveal its true colors. Because the people must bear the heavy burden of military spending, the result is poverty. He said: "Therefore, the people will eventually oppose it."

Someone asked Zhou Enlai how he viewed reports that Israel's refusal to withdraw its troops from Egypt was causing further tension in the region. Premier Zhou Enlai said that he had not studied the reports, but he had expected there would be trouble over the withdrawal of Israeli troops. "This is also another trick by Western countries, the purpose of which is to maintain tension in the Middle East to facilitate their intervention in the region in another way."

The United States adopts a hostile attitude towards China. It does not recognize China. Let the United States refuse to recognize us for ten, one hundred, or a thousand years, China will never collapse, but will stand even more firmly.

Someone asked whether the Chinese government intended to release the American prisoners in China, because Eisenhower had said that the United States would not improve its relations with China if they were not released. Zhou Enlai said: "Asian friends who have suffered from colonialism should not only listen to the US government, but should appeal to the United States to change its attitude towards China on behalf of China."

He pointed out that the United States adopts a hostile attitude towards China. It does not recognize China, prevents China from restoring its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and imposes an embargo on China. But, he said, "Without American recognition, China will still exist and live well. Without American recognition, we will even work harder. Let the United States refuse to recognize us for ten, one hundred, or a thousand years, China will never collapse, but will stand even more firmly."

Visiting Asian countries is to seek knowledge, seek peace, and seek friendship. These three purposes have all been achieved.

Someone asked Zhou Enlai whether his visits to many Asian countries, especially his several visits to India, were of a general goodwill nature or of special significance. Premier Zhou said that he had said several times that his visits had three purposes: to seek knowledge, to seek peace, and to seek friendship. He said that in his visits to eight Asian countries, all three purposes had been achieved. In all these countries, he found that the people strongly wanted peace, and he had gained a lot of knowledge. He explained that China has always believed that all countries have advantages worth learning from. He said: "In fact, we have found many things that we can learn."

He went on to say that his contacts and talks with the leaders of the eight Asian countries were also based on these three purposes and the common desire to strive to promote world peace and to cooperate in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the spirit of the Bandung Conference. He said: "The relations between these countries have greatly improved."

Premier Zhou said that he was very happy about his visit to Sri Lanka. He mentioned Sri Lanka's beautiful scenery, fertile land, and enthusiastic and talented people. "I admire your independent and peaceful policy, and I believe Sri Lanka will have its own brilliant future."

Answering several questions, the Premier said that specific issues regarding economic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka would be dealt with after the exchange of ambassadors. Bandaranaike's recent proposal to establish an economic cooperation mechanism between Asian countries is a good proposal because it is in line with the resolutions adopted by the Bandung Conference.

Regarding Hungary, Premier Zhou said that Western countries, using propaganda and sending secret agents from Vienna to sneak into Hungary, used the Hungarian people's dissatisfaction with the mistakes of the past leadership to carry out subversive activities. These agents and counter-revolutionaries within Hungary succeeded in their plot, took control of the Nagy government, and massacred workers, communists, and those who supported socialism. The then Minister of Defense was a fascist Horthy element, and Bishop Mindszenty fled to the US embassy in Budapest. Documents in the possession of the Kádár government confirmed Western interference.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the proposal for the conclusion of a collective peace pact, first put forward by Nehru, is still in the propaganda stage, because "if the scope of this treaty is Asia, then no Asian country should be missing, and if the scope of the treaty is the Pacific region, then no country along the Pacific coast should be missing."

### 就克什米尔、艾森豪威尔主义、中美关系等问题  周总理在科伦坡答记者问

    就克什米尔、艾森豪威尔主义、中美关系等问题
    周总理在科伦坡答记者问
    新华社科伦坡5日电（迟到）周恩来总理今天下午在科伦坡答复记者们的问题的时候说，中国不赞成派联合国部队到克什米尔去。他说：这是因为中国始终认为把克什米尔问题提交联合国是得不到什么好结果的。
    周恩来总理举行的这次记者招待会共进行了一小时，出席的有大约二十名锡兰和外国记者。
    西方国家利用克什米尔问题在印、巴两国之间制造冲突，以图转移世界人民对中近东的注意力。
    中国将继续努力促使印、巴两国自己寻求和平解决克什米尔问题的办法。
    在继续回答有关克什米尔的问题的时候，周总理警告说，西方国家目前正在利用克什米尔问题在印度和巴基斯坦之间制造冲突。“他们的目的是在亚洲国家中间散播不和的种子，以图转移世界人民对中近东的注意力。”
    他要求亚洲国家团结一致。他说：“只有当亚洲国家在万隆会议的精神下团结一致的时候，它们才能建设它们的国家和摆脱殖民主义所造成的落后状态。”
    他说，他曾经向印度和巴基斯坦呼吁过，要求它们自己来寻求和平解决克什米尔问题的办法。
    有记者问到他在这方面所作的努力的结果时，他说，印度和巴基斯坦都没有拒绝他要求两国举行直接谈判的呼吁。他指出，要实现这一点，需要时间。“正是因为这件事难，我们才正在作努力来促使它得到解决，而不是让西方国家利用克什米尔问题来制造不和。”
    他说，这个问题已经在今天发表的中国总理和锡兰总理的联合声明中提出了。“我们将继续努力。”
    艾森豪威尔对中近东的政策不会有好结果。
    以色列拒绝从埃及撤军是西方国家另一个鬼把戏，以便于它们在这个地区用另一种方式进行干涉。
    有记者要求周恩来对艾森豪威尔主义发表意见，周恩来总理说：“一句话，艾森豪威尔对中近东的政策不会有好结果。”
    他说，甚至在艾森豪威尔主义宣布以前，他就在印度的一次记者招待会上说过，“美国的目的是想在中近东取英法而代之”。他说，这从艾森豪威尔的特别咨文和印度报纸的报道中得到了证明。
    周恩来说，为从事建设的国家所需要的外国援助会受到包括中国在内的亚洲国家的欢迎，这种援助必须是真诚的并且不附带条件。他说，但是为了取得特权、为了建立军事基地和为了使接受援助的国家加入军事集团而提供的援助是不会受到人民的欢迎的。这种援助在某个时期也许会产生一些效果，但是最终它会暴露出它的本来面目。因为人民必须承担军费的沉重负担，结果就陷入贫困。他说：“因此，人民最后会反对它的。”
    有人问周恩来他对以色列拒绝从埃及撤回军队而在这个地区造成进一步紧张局势的报道是怎么看的。周恩来总理说，他没有研究过这种报道，但是他曾料到在以色列军队撤退的问题上会有麻烦。“这也是西方国家的另一个鬼把戏，其目的在于在中近东保持紧张局势以便于它们在这个地区用另一种方式进行干涉。”
    美国对中国采取敌对态度。它不承认中国。让美国拒绝承认我们十年、一百年和一千年吧，中国决不会垮，而将站得更稳。
    有人问中国政府是否打算释放在中国的美国犯人，因为艾森豪威尔说过，假如不释放他们的话，美国不会改善它和中国的关系。周恩来说：“吃过殖民主义的亏的亚洲朋友们不应该只听美国政府的话，而应该替中国呼吁要美国改变它对中国的态度。”
    他指出，美国对中国采取敌对态度。它不承认中国，阻止中国恢复在联合国中的合法席位和对中国实施禁运。但是，他说，“没有美国的承认，中国会仍然存在，并且过得很好。没有美国的承认，我们甚至工作得更有力量。让美国拒绝承认我们十年、一百年和一千年吧，中国决不会垮，而将站得更稳”。
    访问亚洲国家是为了寻求知识、寻求和平和寻求友谊。这三个目的都已经达到了。
    有人问周恩来，他访问了好多亚洲国家，特别是几次到达印度，究竟是具有一般的亲善性质还是具有特殊的重大意义。周总理说，他已经说过好几次，他的访问旅行有三个目的，就是：寻求知识，寻求和平和寻求友谊。他说，在他对八个亚洲国家的访问中，三个目的都已经达到了。在所有这些国家中，他发现人民强烈地要和平，他已经得到很多知识。他解释说，中国一向认为，所有的国家都有值得别人学习的优点。他说：“事实上，我们发现很多我们能够学习的东西。”
    他接着说，他和八个亚洲国家的领导人的接触和会谈，也是根据这三个目的以及努力促进世界和平和按照万隆会议精神与共处的五项原则实行合作的共同愿望来进行的。他说：“这些国家相互之间的关系已经有了很大的增进。”
    周总理说，他对他在锡兰的访问感到非常高兴。他提到锡兰的美丽的风景、肥沃的土地和热情而富有才能的人民。“我敬佩你们的独立的和平政策，我相信锡兰将有它自己的光辉的未来。”
    总理在回答若干问题时说，关于中国和锡兰之间的经济合作方面的具体问题，将在互派大使以后进行处理。班达拉奈克最近所提出的建立亚洲国家之间的经济合作机构的建议是一个好建议，因为它是符合万隆会议所通过的决议的。
    关于匈牙利，周总理说，西方国家用宣传和派遣特务从维也纳潜入匈牙利的方式，利用匈牙利人民对过去领导方面的错误的不满情绪进行颠覆活动。这些特务和匈牙利境内的反革命分子凶谋得逞，控制了纳吉政府，屠杀工人、共产党人和拥护社会主义的人。当时的国防部长是法西斯霍尔蒂分子，明曾蒂主教逃入了驻布达佩斯的美国公使馆。卡达尔政府所掌握的文件证实了西方的干涉。
    周恩来总理说，由尼赫鲁最先提出的缔结集体和平公约的主张现在还在宣传阶段，因为，“如果这个条约的范围是亚洲，那么，就不应该少掉任何亚洲国家，如果条约的范围是太平洋地区，那么，就不应该少掉太平洋沿海的任何国家”。
