    Tianjin Greatly Saves Coal for Heating

    (Our report) Many organizations, troops, and schools in Tianjin are actively responding to the state's call and have formulated strict management systems for heating. Various units are adopting methods such as improving coal burning techniques, extending the time between firings, appropriately lowering indoor temperatures, and re-burning coal cinders to save fuel. Consequently, coal consumption has been effectively reduced in a short period. According to statistics from the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the People's Bank of China, and the Commodity Inspection Bureau, daily coal consumption has decreased from 61,190 catties in the past to 45,910 catties, a reduction of 25.98%.
    As of February 12, these units have saved 7,925 tons of coal during the heating period. (Zhu Zhensheng)
