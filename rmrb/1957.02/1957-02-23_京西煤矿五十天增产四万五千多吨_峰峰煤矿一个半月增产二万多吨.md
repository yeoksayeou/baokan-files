Xinhua News Agency, 21st: In the first fifty days of this year, the miners of Jingxi Coal Mine overfulfilled the state production plan by 18%, increasing the production of raw coal for the state by more than 45,700 tons.

    Based on the completion of the increased production tasks during the Spring Festival holiday, the workers of various production mines continued to maintain high production enthusiasm. Workers in the Panjiangou mining area of the Datai Mine put forward the slogan: Create new records and happily celebrate the Lantern Festival. On the 13th—the day before the Lantern Festival—this area indeed created a new record of 1,100 tons of daily output, exceeding the plan by 30%.

    As early as the end of last year, the leaders of Jingxi Coal Mine repeatedly reviewed the production deployment of various mines, arranged coal mining areas, and increased mining power by adjusting labor organization, creating conditions for increased production. Since the beginning of this year, the director of the mining bureau, the chief engineer, and the heads of the CCP party organization, trade union, and Communist Youth League have gone to the mines twice to help the miners solve many difficult problems in increasing production.

    According to Xinhua News Agency: In the first half of the first quarter of this year, the employees of the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine increased the production of raw coal for the country by 21,900 tons.

    At the beginning of this year, the Fengfeng Mining Bureau Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the widespread slackening of thought among the employees, promptly issued a call to all employees to prevent slackening of thought after the new year and to step up efforts to increase production and practice economy. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the employees of various mines reviewed their past work and generally formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy, thus overfulfilling the January production plan by 3%. During the Spring Festival, the employees enthusiastically responded to the call of the State Council and produced an additional 9,680 tons of coal for the country. As of the 15th, the coal mines under this bureau had overfulfilled the production task for the first half of the first quarter by 21,942 tons.

    京西煤矿五十天增产四万五千多吨
    峰峰煤矿一个半月增产二万多吨
    新华社21日讯　京西煤矿矿工在今年头五十天中超额18％完成国家生产计划，共为国家增产了四万五千七百多吨原煤。
    各生产矿井职工在完成春节假日增产任务的基础上，继续保持着饱满的生产热情。大台矿潘涧沟采区工人提出口号：创造新纪录，愉快过灯节。13日——灯节前一天，这个区果然创造日产一千一百吨的新纪录，超过计划30％。
    京西煤矿领导方面早在去年底，就一再审查各矿的生产部署，安排采煤地区，从调整劳动组织中增加回采力量，为增产创造条件。今年以来，矿务局局长、总工程师和中共党组织、工会、青年团负责人又两次深入到矿，帮助矿工们解决了增产中的许多困难问题。
    据新华社讯　国营峰峰煤矿职工在今年第一季的前半季为国家增产原煤二万一千九百吨。
    今年初，中共峰峰矿务局委员会根据当前职工群众普遍存在着的松劲思想，及时向全体职工发出了防止年后松劲思想、加紧进行增产节约的号召。各矿职工在党委的领导下，检查了过去的工作，普遍制定出增产节约计划，因而超额3％完成了1月份生产计划。春节期间，职工们又热烈响应国务院的号召，为国家多产了九千六百八十吨煤。到15日为止，这个局所属煤矿超额二万一千九百四十二吨完成了第一季上半季的生产任务。
