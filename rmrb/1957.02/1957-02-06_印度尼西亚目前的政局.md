    The Current Political Situation in Indonesia	Shen Dingyi

    At a time when domestic and foreign reactionary forces are desperately trying to overthrow the current Indonesian government, three noteworthy things are happening in the current Indonesian political situation: First, the parliament is in session to discuss the government's report on the Sumatra issue, which will draw a conclusion on the long-debated issue of the government's position; second, a meeting of senior military officers from all over Sumatra Island was held in Palembang, and there is hope that the island's military issues will be resolved through consultation; third, President Sukarno is preparing to participate in politics to resolve Indonesia's unstable situation and will announce his reform plan.

    People in Jakarta hope that the Indonesian political situation will gradually become clearer as a result, and they believe that the issue has reached a critical juncture that must be resolved.

    In recent months, the Indonesian political situation has been particularly complex, with the emergence of a cabinet-overthrow movement launched by elements opposed to the current cabinet in the central government, coordinated with the coups by military figures such as Lubis, Simbolon, and Hussein. When the coup elements in Central and North Sumatra declared their secession from the central government, the Masyumi Party, one of the ruling parties at the time, and the opposition Indonesian Socialist Party, as well as some other small parties, immediately demanded the dissolution of the current cabinet. On the grounds of dissatisfaction with the status quo, they demanded that the current Sastroamidjojo cabinet step down and be replaced by a "caretaker cabinet" led by former Vice President Hatta. Lubis had even drafted a list of "shadow cabinet" members with Hatta as Prime Minister and himself as Deputy Prime Minister.

    Imperialism Stands Behind the Cabinet-Overthrow Activities

    Behind the political activities against the current cabinet stands imperialism. President Sukarno once pointed out at a mass rally in Bandung that imperialism is doing everything possible to undermine the integrity of the Republic of Indonesia and carry out political and economic subversion activities. Imperialism has planted its agents in Indonesia like burying "time bombs."

    Imperialism has attempted to use a small number of upper-level members of certain opposition parties, feudal elements, and warlord politicians to launch a military coup in Indonesia, as the United States has done in some South American countries. After this conspiracy failed, it desperately created local separatist activities to achieve the goal of undermining and overthrowing the current government. There is already a lot of material proving that American and Dutch imperialism are supporting Lubis, Simbolon, and Hussein. Newspapers run by the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, and democratic人士 have continuously exposed this. Newspapers said that American oil trusts are ardent supporters of the "Banteng Council" that seceded from Central Sumatra. The Texaco Oil Company and Mobil Oil Company almost monopolized the oil interests of Central Sumatra. The Secretary-General of the "Banteng Council" also admitted to receiving loans from foreign capitalists.

    After Simbolon launched a coup in North Sumatra, American diplomatic officials in Indonesia expressed their intention to recognize Simbolon's regime. Washington officials also proposed that Hatta be appointed Prime Minister of the cabinet.

    The propaganda machines of the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands also started up together to coordinate with the separatist and disruptive activities of those rebel officers, and tried their best to undermine the Indonesian government. The government has repeatedly pointed out the names of these propaganda agencies and accused them of blatant interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.

    After the coup in North Sumatra, an American news agency asserted that the current cabinet would collapse within five days. However, it was Simbolon and the United States who failed within five days. Because Simbolon was driven away by soldiers opposed to secession activities within this time limit.

    American Ambassador to Indonesia, Cumming, was replaced. Observers in Jakarta believe that he was replaced because his methods of operation in Indonesia were not clever.

    Imperialism is very dissatisfied with the current cabinet that is implementing an anti-colonialist program. Although this program has not yet been fully realized, it has taken unilateral measures to abolish the Round Table Conference Agreement, strengthen the struggle to recover West Irian, and pass some decrees and decisions related to eliminating rebellion activities and building a national economy in ten months.

    "Indonesia Torch Newspaper" pointed out that imperialism has always wanted to turn Indonesia into their anti-communist base in Southeast Asia and plans to seize Indonesia's oil and other rich strategic materials. Of course, they do not want such a country to have a government that implements an independent and autonomous policy.

      The Current Cabinet Has Not Been Intimidated

    In the month or more since the Sumatra incident, domestic and foreign reactionary forces have intensified their attacks on the current Indonesian government, but the current government has not been intimidated. Under the threat of a cabinet overthrow, the current government has always opposed the activity of overthrowing the government without going through the parliament, which violates parliamentary democracy, and has overcome difficulties to maintain the cabinet. The government explicitly announced that the rebellious actions of Lubis, Simbolon, and others were violations of national law and military discipline and took some measures. It is believed that if the government had shown wavering and retreat at that time and announced its dissolution, it might have caused very dangerous internal divisions and foreign interference consequences.

    The government's position was supported by President Sukarno. Sukarno condemned the actions of Simbolon and others, and called on them to mend their ways. This had a great impact on the situation at the time.

    When the Masyumi Party firmly demanded the dissolution of the cabinet, the main political parties of Indonesia took a firm attitude towards the difficult situation. The Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Nahdlatul Ulama both believed that overthrowing the government at that time was an irresponsible act and rejected the Masyumi Party's opinion. The Indonesian Communist Party, which had been the largest opposition party until the Masyumi Party withdrew from the cabinet, resolutely and clearly expressed its opposition to the conspiracy to split the country and repeatedly called on the people to support the current cabinet and assist the government in repelling the attacks of domestic and foreign reactionaries.

    In dealing with the Sumatra issue, the Indonesian government has taken a cautious attitude and tried its best to seek to restore the unity of the army through negotiations and consultations, and strive for coup figures such as Hussein and Simbolon to return to the right path. However, some newspapers in Jakarta also believe that if the government's repeated efforts to win over Simbolon and the "Banteng Council" are ineffective, then decisive measures should be taken to prevent the bad influence they have caused from continuing to spread.

    At the same time, the government, together with the parliament, has taken measures to accelerate the realization of local autonomy and strengthen local construction to meet the legitimate aspirations of the people in various places. This shows that the Indonesian government is treating the general discontent of the people and the conspiracy of the reactionaries differently. The government acknowledges that certain shortcomings and errors do exist in its governance.

    The government is maintaining vigilance against the subversive activities of the imperialist elements.

    Now, the parliament is debating the government's report. It is estimated that the government will receive the understanding and support of a majority of parliamentarians. However, the activities to overthrow the cabinet outside the parliament have not stopped. In addition, some parties have put forward the demand for a thorough reorganization of the cabinet and even a change of the Prime Minister. The Indonesian Nationalist Party stated that this demand was unacceptable, because the party believes that changing the Prime Minister is equivalent to dissolving the cabinet. The current situation shows that although the current cabinet has overcome a major difficulty, there are still difficulties ahead. The situation is still developing. It is believed that if the current Indonesian government can defeat the cabinet-overthrow activities outside the parliament, properly handle the difficult situation it faces, better unite the forces of all parties, and implement its program to meet the aspirations of the people, its position will be consolidated. In such a situation, this cabinet will continue after appropriate reorganization.

      The People Yearn for Political Stability

    President Sukarno is drafting a reform plan (or nation-building plan) that is adapted to the characteristics of Indonesia. The content of this plan has not yet been announced. However, according to Sukarno's own explanations and the materials published in newspapers, the main spirit of this plan is to change the long-term instability of the Indonesian political situation and widely unite the forces of all parties to carry out national construction and oppose colonialism. According to this plan, an advisory committee including a wide range of members will be organized. Sukarno will be the chairman of this committee. However, the role of the parliament and the cabinet will still be respected. Sukarno explained that his plan uses the traditional Indonesian democratic methods of consultation and mutual assistance and cooperation.

    Various political parties have not yet formally expressed their attitude towards this plan. However, it is estimated that many political parties, including the Indonesian Nationalist Party, as well as the headquarters of the three armed forces of the army, navy, and air force, the broad masses of soldiers, and young people will support this plan. The Indonesian Communist Party stated that it would seriously study it. It is also believed that the Nahdlatul Ulama will not have much resistance to this plan. At present, only the Masyumi Party has expressed its opposition.

    The reason why this plan has attracted the widespread attention of the Indonesian people and various political parties is that the majority of the Indonesian people have become tired of the long-standing struggles and competitions between some party groups and yearn to find a way to solve this chaotic situation. They hope to concentrate all their efforts to implement political and economic independence, oppose division and internal strife. They hope that Sukarno's plan is a feasible way to solve this situation at present.

    In the past few months, the Indonesian patriotic and democratic forces, facing the difficult situation, have been strengthened in the struggle, and domestic and foreign reactionary forces have been hit. It is becoming increasingly difficult for imperialism to relive its old dreams in Indonesia.

    印度尼西亚目前的政局	沈定一
    当国内外的反动势力正在竭力要推翻印度尼西亚现政府的时候，印度尼西亚目前的政局中有三件引人注意的事情：一是国会正在开会讨论政府关于苏门答腊问题的报告，它将对争论已久的政府地位问题作出结论；二是在巨港举行了全苏门答腊岛的高级军官会议，这个岛的军事问题出现了通过协商得到解决的希望；三是苏加诺总统准备为解决印度尼西亚的不稳定局势而参政，并且将公布他的革新方案。
    雅加达的人们希望印度尼西亚政局将因此渐趋明朗，人们认为，问题已经到了必须解决的关头了。
    近几个月来，印度尼西亚政治局势特别复杂，出现了反对现内阁分子在中央发动的倒阁风潮和卢比斯、西姆波朗、侯赛尼等军人的政变互相配合的情况。在中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊的政变分子宣布脱离中央的时候，当时作为执政党之一的马斯友美党和在野的印度尼西亚社会党以及其它一些小党派，立即要求解散现内阁。他们以不满现状为理由，要求现在的沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁下台而代之以前副总统哈达领导的“事务内阁”。卢比斯甚至已经拟定了一份以哈达为总理而由他自己任副总理的“影子内阁”名单。
    帝国主义站在倒阁活动的后面
    在反对现内阁的政治活动中，后面站着帝国主义。苏加诺总统曾经在万隆的群众大会上指出，帝国主义正千方百计地破坏印度尼西亚共和国的完整，进行政治上和经济上的颠覆活动。帝国主义像埋藏“定时炸弹”一样地在印度尼西亚布置了它的代理人。
    帝国主义曾企图利用某些反对党派中的少数上层分子、封建主义分子和军阀政客，在印度尼西亚发动军事政变，像美国在南美洲某些国家所干的一样。在这种阴谋失败以后，它就竭力制造地方的分裂活动，以此来达到破坏和推翻现政府的目的。已经有很多材料证明，美、荷帝国主义在支持卢比斯、西姆波朗和侯赛尼。印度尼西亚国民党、印度尼西亚共产党和民主人士所办的报纸曾经连续加以揭露。报纸说，美国的石油托辣斯是割据中苏门答腊的“雄牛师委员会”的热心支持者。德士古石油公司和美孚油公司几乎垄断了中苏门答腊的石油利益。“雄牛师委员会”的秘书长也承认从外国大资本家手中得到了贷款。
    在西姆波朗在北苏门答腊发动政变以后，美国驻印度尼西亚的外交官员曾经表示要承认西姆波朗的政权。华盛顿官员也提出过由哈达出任内阁总理的主张。
    美国、英国和荷兰的宣传机关也一齐开动机器来配合那些反叛军官的分裂和捣乱活动，竭力破坏印度尼西亚政府。政府已经一再指出了这些宣传机关的名字，并且指斥他们对印度尼西亚内政进行粗暴的干涉。
    在北苏门答腊政变发生以后，一家美国的通讯社曾经断言，现内阁会在五天以内垮台。可是，在五天内失败的却是西姆波朗和美国。因为西姆波朗就在这个期限内被反对割据活动的军人赶走了。
    美国驻印度尼西亚大使柯明被撤换了。雅加达的观察家认为，他是因为在印度尼西亚活动的手法很不高明而被撤换的。
    帝国主义对执行着反殖民主义的政纲的现内阁很不满意。这个政纲虽然还未彻底实现，但是，它已经在十个月中采取了单方面废除圆桌会议协定、加强收复西伊里安的斗争、通过了一些有关肃清叛乱活动和建设民族经济的法令和决定。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”指出，帝国主义一向想把印度尼西亚变成它们在东南亚的反共基地，并且打算攫夺印度尼西亚的石油和其他丰富的战略物资。它们当然不愿让这样一个国家有一个执行独立自主政策的政府。
      现内阁没有被吓倒
    在苏门答腊事件发生以来的一个多月中，国内外反动势力加紧了对印度尼西亚现政府的进攻，但是，现政府没有被吓倒。在倒阁的威胁下，现政府一直反对不通过国会就推翻政府这种违反国会民主的活动，并且排除困难，竭力把内阁维持下去。政府明确地宣布卢比斯、西姆波朗等人的反叛行动是违反国法军纪的行动，并且采取了一些措施。人们认为，如果那个时候政府表现动摇退缩而宣告解散，那就可能引起非常危险的内部分裂和外国干涉的后果。
    政府的立场得到了苏加诺总统的支持。苏加诺谴责西姆波朗等人的行动，号召他们改邪归正。这对当时的局面发生了很大影响。
    在马斯友美党坚决要求解散内阁时，印度尼西亚的主要政党对困难的局势采取了坚定的态度。印度尼西亚国民党和伊斯兰教师联合会都认为在那时候推翻政府是一种不负责任的行为，拒绝了马斯友美党的意见。直至马斯友美党退出内阁以前一直是在野第一大党的印度尼西亚共产党，坚决明确地表示反对分裂国家的阴谋，屡次号召人民支持现内阁，协助政府打退国内外反动派的进攻。
    印度尼西亚政府在处理苏门答腊问题上，采取了审慎的态度，尽量通过谈判和协商的方式来谋求恢复军队的统一，争取侯赛尼、西姆波朗等政变分子回到正路上。但是，雅加达也有些报纸认为，如果政府对西姆波朗和“雄牛师委员会”的一再争取无效，那就应该采取断然的措施，免得他们所起的恶劣影响继续蔓延。
    同时，政府同国会在一起采取了加速实现地方自治和加强地方建设的措施，以满足各地人民的正当愿望。这说明印度尼西亚政府是把人民的一般不满情绪和反动派的阴谋区别对待的。政府承认，在施政中，某些缺点和错误确实是存在的。
    政府正对帝国主义分子的颠覆活动保持警惕。
    现在，国会正对政府的报告进行辩论。人们估计，政府将会得到多数议员的谅解和支持。但是，在国会之外进行的倒阁活动并没停止。此外，有些党派提出了彻底改组内阁以至调换总理人选的要求。印度尼西亚国民党表示这个要求无法接受，因为这个党认为调换总理等于解散内阁。现在的情况说明，现内阁虽然度过了一个重大的难关，但是前面还有困难。局势还在发展之中。人们认为，如果印度尼西亚现政府能够击败国会以外的倒阁活动，妥善地处理面临的困难局面，更好地团结各方面的力量，并且贯彻实施它的政纲以满足人民的愿望，它的地位将会得到巩固。在这样的情况下，在进行了适当的改组之后，这届内阁将会维持下去。
      人民渴望政局稳定
    苏加诺总统正在拟定一项适应印度尼西亚的特点的革新方案（或称建国方案）。这个方案的内容还没有公布。但是，据苏加诺自己所作的说明和报纸所刊载的材料，这个方案的主要精神是要改变长期来印度尼西亚政局的不稳定现象，广泛地团结各方面的力量来进行国家建设和反对殖民主义。根据这个方案，将组织一个包括广泛成分的顾问委员会。苏加诺将任这个委员会的主席。但是，国会和内阁的作用仍将被尊重。苏加诺解释说，他的方案是运用了印度尼西亚传统的协商和互助合作的民主方式。
    各政党对这个方案还没有正式表示态度。但是，人们估计包括印度尼西亚国民党在内的许多政党，以及陆海空三军的参谋部、广大的军人和青年都会支持这个方案。印度尼西亚共产党表示要认真地研究。人们还认为，伊斯兰教师联合会对这个方案不会有很大的阻力。目前只有马斯友美党表示了反对的意见。
    这个方案所以引起印度尼西亚人民和各政党的广泛注意，是因为印度尼西亚的多数人民已经对长期以来存在着的一些党派集团之间的斗争和角逐感到厌倦，渴望找到解决这种混乱局面的途径。他们希望集中一切力量来贯彻政治上和经济上的独立，反对分裂和内部倾轧。他们希望苏加诺的方案是一项目前解决这种局面的可行的办法。
    几个月来，面对困难局面的印度尼西亚爱国民主力量在斗争中得到了加强，国内外反动力量已经受到了打击。帝国主义要想在印度尼西亚重温旧梦是越来越困难了。
