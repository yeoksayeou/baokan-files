	Response to Criticism

	Strengthening Education, Respecting the Rights of Performers
	Your newspaper published an article by Comrade Wei Zhenqing, a reader, on page 8 on November 9, 1956, entitled "Protecting the Human Rights of Performers," exposing the incident in which the Yigong Huai Opera Troupe of our county was beaten and injured by some lawless Party members, cadres, and members of the Xizhi Agricultural Cooperative in Qin Gong Town, Haoqu District. The article is generally consistent with the actual situation, with only slight discrepancies in individual details. We accept this criticism. The County Party Committee expresses deep sympathy for the performers' experience. The County Party Committee and the Discipline Inspection Commission believe that the education of the vast number of Party members and the masses in our county on abiding by laws and respecting the rights and interests of performers is very inadequate. The handling of this incident has also been relatively slow. Now, the County Party Committee has instructed us to organize a team including the court, the procuratorate, and cultural and scientific departments to re-investigate and deal with the incident at the scene of the incident. (Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Huai'an County Committee, Jiangsu Province)

	Investigating the "Problems in the Trash"
	After your newspaper published the article "Problems in the Trash" on page 8 on November 1, 1956, it has attracted the attention of the Anhui Provincial People's Procuratorate, the branch procuratorate, and the Ningguo County Procuratorate. The county procurators conducted a careful investigation, thoroughly clarifying the situation and the reasons for the security breach. The court and relevant personnel conducted a review and, with the help of the Provincial Procuratorate, improved the document storage system. At present, the chaotic situation in document storage in the Ningguo County Procuratorate has been basically eliminated.

    对批评的反应
    加强教育、尊重艺人权益
    你报1956年11月9日八版刊载读者魏镇清同志作的“保障艺人的人权”一文，揭发了我县艺工淮剧团被郝渠区钦工镇西支农业社一部分不守法的党员、干部、社员拦路殴打成伤事件，基本符合实际情况，仅个别情节略有出入。我们接受这一批评。县委对艺人的这一遭遇深表同情。县委和监委认为：对本县广大党员、群众的遵纪守法、尊重艺人的权益的教育，是很不够的。对这一事件的处理也是比较迟缓的。现在，县委已责成我们组织了一个包括法院、检察院、文化科学部门参加的小组，再去肇事地点复查、处理。（中共江苏省淮安县监察委员会）
    检查“垃圾里的问题”
    本报1956年11月1日八版发表“垃圾里的问题”一文后，已引起安徽省人民检察院、分院以及宁国县检察院的重视。县检察员认真进行了检查，彻底查清了失密的情况和原因，该院及有关人员进行了检讨，并在省检察院帮助下，健全了公文保管制度。目前宁国县检察院公文保管中的混乱现象已经基本消除。
