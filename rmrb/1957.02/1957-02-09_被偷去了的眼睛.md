The Stolen Eyes
        By Soviet Writer, Wa·Lieduniefu

    According to reports, a British doctor removed the eyes of an Egyptian youth named Mohammed Mahran Osman in order to transplant a living cornea to a British soldier.

    I know there are many thieves in the world,
    I know thieves can steal money
    honor, sincerity, secrets,
    poetry
    lovers, even power.
    It has all happened.
    Clever old thieves can even crack safes.
    It has all happened….
    But no one has ever stolen eyes before.
    Now someone has stolen them….
    Those eyes can no longer see the world,
    Completely stolen.
    Englishmen,
    This priority belongs to you!
    The eye-stealing thief is cruel and indifferent.
    Osman is blind.
    The soldier who brought the war to the East has regained his sight!
    Soldier!
    You have eyes,
    But do you know,
    It wasn't your mother who loved to kiss them when you were a child,
    It was another mother singing lullabies.
    It wasn't you who protected them,
    It wasn't you who first saw life with them,
    Admiring the flowers of the Nile, the sky, and Cairo.
    These eyes are someone else's, not yours.
    Nature endowed them to someone who fought loyally for the honor of their country.
    Eyes,
    I cherish them!
    But, to let Osman see the light again,
    I would give him one of my eyes,
    To let him fight bravely.
    Be strong, Osman,
    Osman, don't cry, remember
    Your pain.
    Let the executioner doctor fear those eyes that cannot cry!
    You are not alone—the people,
    Tens of millions of people shake hands with you.
    Your stern gaze calls people to fight—this gaze no one can steal!
              (Translated by Jun Qiang and Wan Qing)

    被偷去了的眼睛
        苏联　瓦·列德涅夫
    据报载，一个英国医生，把一个名叫穆罕默德·玛赫兰·奥斯曼的埃及青年的眼睛挖去，为的是给一个英国士兵移植活角膜
    我知道世界上有许多盗贼，
    我知道盗贼能偷金钱
    荣誉  真诚  秘密，
    诗歌
    爱人  甚至  权力。
    这都发生过。
    巧妙的老贼甚至能咬开保险柜。
    这都发生过……。
    但是过去从未有人偷过眼睛。
    如今有人偷了……。
    那双眼已看不见世界，
    被偷得干干净净。
    英国人，
    属于你们啊这份优先权！
    偷眼睛的贼惨酷而冷淡。
    奥斯曼失明了。
    带战火到东方的士兵复明了！
    士兵啊！
    你有了眼睛，
    但你知道，
    儿时不是你的母亲喜欢亲吻它们，
    那是另一位母亲唱着摇篮歌的时辰。
    不是你保护了它们，
    不是你用它们初次看生活，
    欣赏尼罗河鲜花  天空和开罗。
    这双眼是别人的不是你的。
    大自然把它们赋给一位为祖国荣誉忠诚奋斗的人。
    眼睛，
    我珍贵它们！
    但是，为了让奥斯曼重见光明，
    我愿送他一只眼睛，
    让他去勇猛斗争。
    坚强起来奥斯曼，
    奥斯曼不要哭要记住
    你的痛苦。
    让刽子手医生惧怕那哭不出泪的眼睛！
    你不是一个人——人民
    千千万万的人同你握手。
    你那严峻的目光号召人们战斗这种目光谁也不能偷！
              （君强　万青译）
