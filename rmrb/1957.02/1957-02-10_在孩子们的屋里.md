    In the Children's Room	Deng Youmei
    The school called to say that my little sister, who is not yet nine years old, was "starting a revolution." She secretly took a quilt with a little girl who was a year younger than her and moved from the first dormitory to the second dormitory. The reason was that the children in the first dormitory all paid childcare fees, and she thought it was embarrassing to ask the nanny for help when she could do everything herself. The little one also thought it was too embarrassing to have the nanny take care of everything, but she hadn't learned how to wash her hair or clothes yet, so my little sister said, "What are you afraid of? I'll wash them for you."
    The teachers and nannies tried to persuade them to go back several times, but they refused, so the school asked me to persuade them.
    I was very happy to hear this news, feeling that they were more sensible than I was at their age, but I had no reason to refuse the school's suggestion. One evening, I went to the school.
    I found the room where my sister had moved. There were only three little girls in the room. One with short hair and one with braids were sitting on the edge of the bed playing cards. The short-haired one was from Guangdong and called the four of hearts "Féng táo xì" (a Cantonese pronunciation). Both of them were only eleven or twelve years old. The other one was standing on the bed, doing her homework close to the light. She looked only seven or eight years old, was quite chubby, and missing a tooth.
    I asked, "Little friends, do you know where Deng Xiaolan went?"
    The three of them looked at me together, then looked at each other, and giggled for no reason. I laughed along with them, feeling puzzled.
    The little girl from Guangdong stopped laughing first and said, "She moved away."
    The chubby little one with the missing tooth said, "Moved in, then moved back."
    The one with braids said, "She couldn't stand the atmosphere here and went back crying."
    I asked strangely, "Who would make her feel that way?"
    "She argued with the dormitory supervisor!" The chubby little one jumped off the bed, identified her shoes and said, "Wait a moment, I'll go call her. You can persuade her to move back later."
    The chubby little one had just run out the door when she retreated, looking panicked and whispering, "Dorm inspection!" After saying that, she stood properly against the wall. The one with braids winked at the little girl from Guangdong, and the two continued to play cards, pretending they didn't know anything.
    Three people came in. The first was a girl, holding a pen and notebook in her hand. The second was wearing a cadre cap and a gray uniform, a head taller than the girl. The third was standing behind, and I couldn't see clearly.
    The one wearing the cadre cap surveyed the entire room with his hands behind his back. When he saw half a dustpan of paper scraps in the corner, he put on a stern face and asked the one with braids, "Who's on duty today?"
    The one with braids also glanced at the corner, but didn't say anything.
    "Who's on duty? I'm asking you!" The one wearing the cadre cap said in an adult-like tone, "Why aren't you answering me?"
    "Collective duty." After the one with braids said that, she threw out a card: "Old K".
    "Don't play cards," said the one wearing the cadre cap, "Who told you to implement collective duty? Collective duty! Lying! Why didn't you empty the trash?"
    The two playing cards threw down their cards, lowered their heads and didn't say a word. The little chubby one glanced at the one wearing the cadre cap and tried to shrink herself into the corner. The air in the room became tense.
    "Do you still look like anything? Huh? Does this still look like a dormitory? Huh? I told you to lead them, and you lead them like this! You still have the face to lie to me? And you're taking the lead in playing here? What kind of ideological style is this? Huh? You should be more conscious? Huh? You can go visit other dormitories and learn from them? Huh? Do you still look like anything?..." He lectured for a full five minutes.
    Perhaps these words weren't anything terribly wrong, but that tone was too scary. I had heard this tone in the adult world more than once. People who used this unhurried, drawn-out tone, saying "Huh?" after every sentence, were mostly wearing uniforms, with their hands behind their backs, and their cold faces turned towards the sky. I am over twenty years old, and even in the summer, hearing this tone sends a chill down my spine. And the people in front of me were three children! That unlucky "leader" was only eleven or twelve years old!
    I thought the one wearing the cadre cap was a school staff member with a bad work style, and I really wanted to say a few words to his face, but when I saw his majestic face, I swallowed the words back.
    Finally, the girl with braids burst into tears on the bed.
    "You still have the face to cry! Not strong at all. I won't say much to you today!" The one wearing the cadre cap turned and walked out majestically, saying loudly, "Write it down, we'll talk about it tomorrow."
    The air in the room didn't warm up for a long time.
    I asked, "Is that a cadre?"
    "A classmate, from sixth grade!" The little girl from Guangdong pouted. "Extremely arrogant, a lot of people are afraid of him! But the teacher likes him a lot, he's involved in everything! Xiaolan argued with him because he always criticizes Xiaolan whenever he comes in, saying she has no discipline and is not a good student!"
    At this moment, the chubby little one, shrinking in the corner, quietly picked up the dustpan and walked outside. The little girl from Guangdong shouted, "Put it down, what's wrong with keeping the trash we swept tonight until tomorrow morning?"
    The chubby little one said with a crying voice, "I'm on duty today. He'll scold me if he finds out tomorrow! Sister Liu is crying..."
    I comforted them for a couple of sentences and walked out, feeling inexplicably uncomfortable. I vaguely felt that I had let the children down and hadn't done enough for them. I felt sorry for them, and I also felt sorry for that "dormitory supervisor." He was only sixteen or seventeen years old, wasn't he! Could it be that he was born this way...

    在孩子们的屋里	邓友梅
    学校里打电话来说，我那个未满九周岁的小妹妹“闹起革命来了”。她带着一个比她还小一岁的小姑娘，偷偷抱着被子从第一宿舍搬到第二宿舍去了。原因是第一宿舍的孩子都交保育费，她认为自己什么都会作，叫阿姨帮助是件丢人事。那个小的也认为事事有阿姨管太丢人，不过自己还没学会洗头洗衣服，我小妹妹就说：“那怕什么，我给你洗好了。”
    老师和阿姨去劝了几次，她们不肯回去，学校就叫我去说服。
    听了这消息我倒很高兴，觉着她们比自己小时懂事的多，但也没理由拒绝学校的建议。有一天黄昏，就上学校去了。
    我找到妹妹新搬去的那间屋。屋里只有三个小姑娘。一个剪了发的和一个梳小辫的坐在床沿上打扑克，剪头发的是广东人，管红桃四叫“逢桃细”。这两人都不过十一二岁。另一个站在床上凑近电灯作功课，看来只有七八岁，长的挺胖，缺一棵牙齿。
    我问：“小朋友，知道邓小兰上那儿去了吗？”
    她们三人一齐看看我，又互相看看，无原无故地格格地笑了起来。我也莫名其妙地跟着笑了。
    广东小姑娘先停住笑，说：“她搬走了。”
    缺牙齿的小胖子说：“搬来了，又搬回去了。”
    梳小辫的说：“她受不了这儿的气，哭着回去了。”
    我奇怪道：“谁会给她气受？”
    “她跟宿舍干事吵架了！”小胖子从床上跳下来，脚认着鞋说：“你等一等，我去叫她，回头你劝她再搬回来吧。”
    小胖子刚跑出门，又退了回来，满脸慌张地，小声说：“查宿舍来了。”说完就规规矩矩的靠墙站好。梳小辫的对广东小姑娘挤了挤眼，两人又继续玩牌，假装什么也不知道。
    进来了三个人。头一个是女孩，手里拿着钢笔和本儿。第二个戴着干部帽，穿着灰制服，个子比女孩高一头。第三个站在后边，看不大清。
    戴干部帽的倒背着手扫视了全屋，回头看见墙角上有半簸箕纸头，便把脸一板，问梳小辫的说：“今天谁值日？”
    梳小辫的也偷偷看了一眼那墙角，没言语。
    “谁值日？我问你哪！”戴干部帽的用成人式的调子说：“为什么不回答我？”
    “集体值日。”梳小辫的说完，又扔出一张牌去：“老K”。
    “不要打牌了，”戴干部帽的说：“谁让你们实行集体值日的？集体值日！撒谎！为什么不倒土？”
    两个打牌的把牌扔下，低着头一声不响，小胖拿眼瞧瞧戴干部帽的，使劲的往墙角里缩了缩身子，屋子里空气紧张起来了。
    “你们还像个样子吗？嗯？这还像个宿舍吗？嗯？叫你领导她们，你领导成这个样子！还有脸跟我说谎？还带头在这玩？这是什么思想作风？嗯？应该自觉一点?，嗯？可以到别的宿舍去参观一下，学学人家?，嗯？你们还像话吗？……”这样，他足足训了五分钟。
    也许这些话没什么大错，但那腔调可太可怕了。我曾不止一次在成年人的世界里听到过这种腔调，操这种不慌不忙、拖着长声、一句一个“嗯？”的腔调的人，多半都穿着制服，倒背着手，把一张冷冰冰的脸孔朝着天空。我是二十多岁的人了，即使在夏天听到这腔调，背上都一阵发凉。而我面前的却是三个孩子啊！那个倒霉的“领导者”也只不过十一二岁呢！
    我以为戴干部帽的是位作风不佳的校方工作人员，很想当面顶他两句，但一见他那威严的面孔，又把话咽了回去。
    终于，梳小辫的女孩子伏在床上哭了。
    “还有脸哭！一点也不坚强，今天不跟你多讲了！”戴干部帽的威风凛凛地转身朝外走去，大声说：“记下来，明天再说。”
    这屋里的空气好久也没暖过来。
    我问：“这是个干部吧！”
    “同学，六年级的！”广东小姑娘噘着嘴说。“骄傲极了，好多人都怕他！可是老师顶喜欢他，作什么都有他！小兰就是跟他吵架的，他每次进来都说小兰，说她没有纪律性，不是好学生！”
    这时，缩在墙根的小胖子悄悄地端起簸箕来就往外走，广东小姑娘喊道：“放下，晚上才扫的土，留到明早一起倒有什么不对？”
    小胖子带着哭声说：“我是值日生，明天他查出来要说我的！刘姐姐都气哭了……”
    我安慰了她们两句，走出来了，心中说不出不舒服。愰忽觉得自己有些对不起孩子们，为她们作的事太少了。我心疼她们，也心疼那位“宿舍干事”，他也不过才十六七岁吧！难道是天生的……
