Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th -- The Tianjin Scientific Research Supplies Service Department, which is welcomed by scientists, has helped twenty-six scientific research units and universities solve one hundred and twenty-two supply problems of materials and instruments in the past two months.

　　During the hydraulic research process at the Hydraulic Hall of Tianjin University, the lack of a DC generator set on the market stalled some research work for more than a year. Later, with the help of the supply service department, the needed instrument was purchased from the Tianjin Waste Products Management Office. The Chemistry Department of Tianjin Normal College needed fifty hard glass bottles that could withstand atmospheric pressure for experimental research. The staff of the supply service department found a batch of usable old bottles for them in an old bottle shop. When Tianjin obstetrics and gynecology expert Dr. Ke Yingkui was studying a new method for measuring the pelvis of Chinese women, he needed a batch of brass plates to make pelvic measuring instruments. The supply service department also promptly solved his difficulties in order to support Dr. Ke's research work.

　　This supply service department also supplied many valuable chemical reagents to the Tianjin Industrial Experimental Institute and the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Research Office. It solved the need for rare metals such as tungsten wire, molybdenum wire, and nickel plates for Nankai University and Tianjin Normal College.

　　This commercial institution, which specializes in serving scientific research, was established in November of last year by drawing professional and knowledgeable commercial workers from Tianjin's five state-owned companies: medicine, culture, hardware, chemical industry, and electrical appliances. Its establishment has been praised by many scientists.

    天津科学研究用品供应服务处受到科学家欢迎
    新华社天津10日电　受到科学家们欢迎的天津市科学研究用品供应服务处，两个月来已经帮助二十六个科学研究单位和高等学校解决了一百二十二件材料、仪器的供应问题。
    天津大学水利馆在进行水利研究过程中，由于在市场上购买不到直流发电机组，曾使部分研究工作停顿了一年多。后因得到供应服务处的帮助，才在天津市废品经营处买到了所需要的仪器。天津师范学院化学系需要五十个硬质能抗大气压力的玻璃瓶作实验研究用，供应服务处的工作人员就在一家旧瓶子店里为他们找到了一批可以代用的旧瓶子。天津妇产科专家柯应夔大夫在研究测量中国产妇骨盆新方法时，需要一批制造骨盆测量器的黄铜板。供应服务处为了支持柯大夫的研究工作，也及时地解决他的困难。
    这个供应服务处还供应给天津市工业试验所、天津市药物研究室很多贵重的化学试剂。为南开大学、天津师范学院解决了钨丝、钼丝、镍板等稀有金属的需要。
    这个专门为科学研究服务的商业机构，是去年11月间由天津市医药、文化、五金、化工、交电五个国营公司抽调有专业知识的商业工作者成立的，它的设立得到了许多科学家的赞扬。
