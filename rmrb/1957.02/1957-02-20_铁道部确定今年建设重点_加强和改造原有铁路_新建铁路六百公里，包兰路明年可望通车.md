Xinhua News Agency, 19th. This year, the focus of railway construction in our country will be on strengthening and transforming existing railways, and the construction speed of new railways will be appropriately adjusted. This was determined recently by the Ministry of Railways after studying the state's construction guidelines for this year and the current railway transportation situation.

According to the established plan, about three-fifths of the state's investment in railways this year will be used for the reconstruction of existing railways, the construction of double tracks, the expansion of hub stations, and the increase of locomotives and vehicles. Only about 600 kilometers of new railways will be built this year.

The current situation of railways in our country is as follows: the track-laying task for new railways stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan has been completed ahead of schedule, but the task of strengthening and transforming existing railways has only completed 72% of the requirements of the Five-Year Plan in the past four years. In 1956, the national railway transport volume had already reached the level stipulated for 1957 in the Five-Year Plan. Due to the rapid growth of transport volume, while the strengthening and transformation of existing railways has not kept pace accordingly, great difficulties occurred in last year's transportation. In particular, the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the western section of the Longhai Railway, and the Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan railways were particularly strained. The transportation situation last year proved that the vast majority of railway transportation volume in our country is currently borne by existing railways. In the next few years, the construction of new inland industrial bases will mainly rely on the support of existing industrial bases in coastal areas, and the transportation of large quantities of materials will still be concentrated on existing railways. Therefore, this year it is necessary to appropriately shift the focus of railway construction to strengthening and transforming existing railways in order to meet the needs of national economic development.

This year's transformation of existing railways mainly focuses on strengthening the passing capacity of several major trunk lines within the area north of the Longhai Railway and west of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. In addition to reconstructing the major artery to the Northwest—the Baoji to Lanzhou Railway, the north-south Tongpu Railway traversing Shanxi Province, and some other railways this year, we will also focus on building more than 600 kilometers of double tracks on the very busy sections of the Fengtai to Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang to Yangquan, Zhengzhou to Shanxian, and Jingbao lines. The passing capacity of double tracks can be increased by one to one and a half times compared to single tracks. In order to strengthen the transportation capacity of existing railways, 14 hub stations such as Beijing and Wuhan will also be expanded this year, and 212 kilometers of automatic block equipment that can automatically indicate train operation will continue to be installed on the double-track railway from Beijing to Jinzhou. Installing this new technical equipment on double tracks can increase the passing capacity of the line by more than one time.

Another important measure to strengthen the transportation capacity of existing railways is to increase locomotives and vehicles. This year, it is planned to add 160 new locomotives and more than 6,800 new passenger and freight cars. In addition, some of the locomotives currently in operation will also be renovated to improve the traction capacity of these locomotives.

Since a considerable portion of funds, materials, and manpower are being transferred to the strengthening and transformation of existing railways, coupled with the fact that there are still many unfinished projects left over from new lines that have completed track-laying, such as the Baocheng Railway and the Yingxia Railway, the number of new railways built this year cannot be too many. This year, we will mainly concentrate our efforts on building the second transportation trunk line to the new industrial area in the Northwest—the Baotou to Lanzhou Railway. A total of 320 kilometers of track will be laid on the northern and southern sections of this railway this year, and it is planned to be open to traffic before the end of 1958. In order to connect with the transportation of the Gansu-Xinjiang and Qinghai-Tibet highways, the Lanxin Railway will also lay another 36 kilometers of track to Hongliuyuan, which is close to Xinjiang, this year. The southwest railway trunk line mainly focuses on the key project of the Duyun to Guiyang section of the Qian-Gui Railway. Efforts will be made to open the railway from Bisezhai to Hekou in Yunnan Province to traffic by the end of this year. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which connects the Beijing-Hankou and Yue-Han railways, will be basically completed this year.

### 铁道部确定今年建设重点  加强和改造原有铁路  新建铁路六百公里，包兰路明年可望通车

    铁道部确定今年建设重点
    加强和改造原有铁路
    新建铁路六百公里，包兰路明年可望通车
    新华社19日讯　今年我国铁路建设的重点将放在加强和改造原有的铁路方面，对于新建铁路的建设速度将加以适当调整。这是铁道部研究了国家今年的建设方针和目前铁路运输的状况以后在最近确定的。
    按照已经确定的计划，国家今年对铁路的投资将有五分之三左右用在原有铁路的改建、修建复线、扩建枢纽车站和增加机车车辆等方面。今年建筑的新铁路只有六百公里左右。
    我国铁路目前的情况是：第一个五年计划规定的新建铁路铺轨任务已经提前完成，但原有铁路的加强和改造任务在过去四年中只完成五年计划规定的72％。1956年全国铁路的运输量已经达到五年计划规定的1957年的水平。由于运量的迅速增长，而原有铁路的加强和改造工作却没有相应地赶上去，因而在去年的运输中就发生了很大的困难。特别是京汉北段、陇海西段和石家庄到太原几条铁路，运输特别紧张。去年运输的情况证明，目前我国铁路绝大部分的运输量是由原有的铁路承担的。在今后若干年内，内地新工业基地的建设主要还是依靠沿海地区原有工业基地的支援，大量物资的运输仍将集中在现有的铁路上。因而，今年必须将铁路建设的重点适当转移到加强和改造原有的铁路方面，这样才能适应国民经济发展的需要。
    今年对原有铁路的改造主要是加强陇海路以北、京汉路以西这个范围内几条主要干线的通过能力。今年除了改建通往西北的大动脉——宝鸡到兰州的铁路、纵贯山西省的南北同蒲铁路和其他一些铁路外，还将着重在丰台到郑州、石家庄到阳泉、郑州到陕县和京包等线路运输十分繁忙的区段，修建复线六百多公里。复线的通过能力可以比单线提高一倍到一倍半左右。为了加强原有铁路的运输能力，今年还将扩建北京、武汉等十四个枢纽车站，并且在北京到锦州的铁路复线上，继续装设能够自动指示列车运行的自动闭塞装置二百一十二公里。在复线上装设这种新的技术装备，可以提高线路的通过能力一倍以上。
    加强现有铁路运输能力的另一个重要措施是增加机车车辆。今年计划增加的新机车有一百六十台，新的客车和货车有六千八百多辆。此外，现在正在运行的机车也有一部分要加以改造，以提高这些机车的牵引能力。
    由于相当大的一部分资金、材料和人力转移到原有铁路的加强和改造方面，再加上已经完成铺轨的新线如宝成铁路和鹰厦铁路等遗留的未完工程还很大，因而今年新建的铁路就不能太多了。今年主要是集中力量修建通往西北新工业区的第二条运输干线——包头到兰州的铁路。这条铁路南北两段今年总共要铺轨三百二十公里，计划在1958年年底前通车。为了和甘新、青藏两条公路的运输相衔接，兰新铁路今年还将再铺轨三十六公里到邻近新疆的红柳园。西南的铁路干线主要是进行黔桂铁路都匀到贵阳一段的重点工程。云南省境内碧色寨到河口的铁路争取在今年年底通车。联结京汉和粤汉两条铁路的武汉长江大桥将在今年基本建成。
