    Modifying Machine Design
    (Our report) The Jianxin Machine Factory in Tangshan City modified the design of a large filter press, saving materials and reducing steel consumption by one hundred and thirty tons annually.
    In order to conserve steel, the Jianxin Machine Factory in Tangshan City conducted a comprehensive review of the blueprints for its large filter presses. Under the principle of not affecting quality and usage, the design was modified to reduce material consumption. For example, the filter plates of the filter press, which were originally 43 mm thick, have been changed to 40 mm thick. This saves 45 jin of gray pig iron per plate. Each machine has a total of forty plates, so this improvement alone saves 1,800 jin of iron. The large shaft was originally 85 mm thick, but has been changed to 70 mm thick, saving 60 jin of iron. Originally, for aesthetic reasons, two tie rods were installed on the machine base, but they had no practical use. Now they have been removed, saving 6 meters of one-inch round steel per machine. With the newly modified design, the total weight of the machine has been reduced from the original seven tons to six tons. After testing, it does not affect the machine's lifespan or usage in any way. (Zu Yin, Qing He)

    修改机器设计
    本报讯　唐山市建新机器厂修改大型滤泥机的设计节约用料，全年可以节省一百三十吨钢铁。
    唐山市建新机器厂为了节约钢铁，对其生产的大型滤泥机图样进行了全面审核，在不影响质量和使用的原则下，修改了设计，减少了用料。像滤泥机的滤泥片，厚四十三公厘，这次改为四十公厘，每片可以节省四十五斤灰白铁，每台机器共四十片，这一项改进，可以节省铁一千八百斤。大轴原来是八十五公厘粗，这次改为七十公厘，省铁六十斤。原来机器上为了美观在机座上安两根拉条，实际没有一点用处，现在把它去掉，每台机器可以节约一寸元钢六公尺。新修改的设计，机器全重由原来七吨减少到六吨。经过鉴定丝毫不影响机器寿命和使用。　（祖印、庆和）
