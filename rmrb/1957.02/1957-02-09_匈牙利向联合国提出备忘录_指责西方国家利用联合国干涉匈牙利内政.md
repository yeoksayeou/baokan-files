Xinhua News Agency, February 8th dispatch from New York by TASS: The United Nations Secretariat has published a memorandum from the government of the Hungarian People's Republic "regarding the issues discussed at the second emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly held from November 4th to 10th, 1956."

The memorandum first accuses the United Nations, at the instigation and pressure of certain Western countries, of interfering in Hungary's internal affairs. It states that the United Nations arena was used to exacerbate tensions and obstruct the restoration of order and tranquility in Hungary, thereby forcing the Hungarian delegation to withdraw from the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The memorandum goes on to say that the government of the Hungarian People's Republic has so far been unable to participate in the 11th session of the General Assembly as an equal nation because the General Assembly continues to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. Based on the proposal of the United States and twenty-one other countries, a special committee was established on January 18th to investigate and interrogate various slanderers of the Hungarian People's Republic and its government in order to conduct propaganda hostile to socialist countries. Therefore, the Hungarian government cannot consider the work of this committee to be legitimate.

The memorandum emphasizes the legitimacy of the current Hungarian government, pointing out that its measures are in line with the vital interests of the Hungarian people, and citing facts to accuse the governments of many Western countries of supporting the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary. The memorandum also points out that the Hungarian government's request for Soviet troops to assist in crushing the counter-revolutionary riots is in accordance with the peace treaty signed in Paris on February 10, 1947. As for the issue of the arrival and withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungarian territory, it concerns only the Hungarian and Soviet governments, and the other participating countries of the Warsaw Pact.

The memorandum also cites facts to refute the hostile slanders that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government disregards the interests of the working people.

    匈牙利向联合国提出备忘录
    指责西方国家利用联合国干涉匈牙利内政
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约7日讯：联合国秘书处公布了匈牙利人民共和国政府“关于联合国大会1956年11月4日到10日举行的第二次紧急会议所讨论的问题”的备忘录。
    备忘录首先指责联合国在某些西方国家的发起和压力下干涉匈牙利内政，并且使得联合国的会场被利用来加剧紧张局势和阻止匈牙利的秩序和安宁的恢复，从而迫使匈牙利代表团退出了联合国大会第十一次会议的会场。
    备忘录接着说，匈牙利人民共和国政府至今未能作为平等国家参加第十一届联大会议，因为联大还在继续干涉匈牙利的内政。根据美国和二十一国的建议，1月18日成立了一个专门委员会，向形形色色诽谤匈牙利人民共和国及其政府的人调查讯问，以便进行敌视社会主义国家的宣传。因此匈牙利政府不能认为这个委员会的工作是合法的。
    备忘录强调指出现任匈牙利政府的合法性，指出它的措施是符合匈牙利人民的切身利益的，并且引证事实指责许多西方国家的政府支持匈牙利的反革命暴乱。备忘录还指出，匈牙利政府要求苏联军队援助粉碎反革命暴乱是符合1947年2月10日在巴黎签订的和约的。至于苏军的到来和从匈牙利领土撤退的问题，则只同匈牙利和苏联政府以及华沙条约的其他参加国有关。
    备忘录还举出事实驳斥了关于匈牙利工农革命政府不顾劳动人民利益的敌意谰言。
