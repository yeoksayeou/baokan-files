    District Committee Secretary Fails to Understand Specific Circumstances Despite Living in the Commune
    Preparatory Work for Spring Plowing in Linhui County's Hualing Agricultural Cooperative is Very Poor
    (Reported by this newspaper) The preparatory work for spring plowing in Hualing Cooperative, Liangjiang District, Linhui County, Guangxi, is very poor this year.
    Hualing Cooperative has 1,199 households and 9,643 mu of land. The plan stipulates that agricultural production this year should increase by 20% compared to last year, sideline production should increase by 68% compared to last year, and economic crop production should increase even more. However, none of the fifteen water conservancy projects planned for construction and repair have started yet. The plan was to burn 1.65 million jin of lime as fertilizer by the end of January, but only 900,000 jin were burned, completing 54% of the plan. The plan was to plant 5,200 mu of green manure, but only 3,600 mu were planted, which is 700 mu less than last year. In addition, the management after planting was poor, and it is estimated that the entire cooperative will have 40% less green manure than last year. Other fertilizer accumulation work has not been carried out from last autumn until now. Chucun has a tradition of cutting grass for livestock bedding and accumulating manure. In previous winters, a production team would cut more than 20,000 jin of grass and accumulate or compost more than 2,000 dan of fertilizer. This winter, no production team accumulated fertilizer. The situation of cattle deaths and emaciation is even more serious. Out of the 850 cattle in the entire cooperative, 44 have died, and 60% of the remaining cattle are too emaciated to be used. Because of this, 841 mu of land in the cooperative will lack cattle power for plowing in the spring. The loss of farm tools is also very serious. Out of the 700 plows in the cooperative, 420 are damaged and unusable. Out of the 645 harrows in the cooperative, 190 have broken teeth or damaged frames. In addition, the cooperative is short more than 800 plowshares, and the cooperative has not made any plans to remedy this.
    The main reason why the preparatory work for spring plowing in Hualing Cooperative is not going well is that the cadres are satisfied with last year's 4% increase in production and are developing complacency. The township branch secretary who leads the cooperative said, "This year, the higher authorities are not emphasizing the promotion of advanced technology, and less wheat and barley are planted than last year. With the existing amount of lime and manure, we can guarantee increased production even without accumulating fertilizer." Comrade Zhou Qiaobao, the Liangjiang District Committee Secretary who personally directed production in the cooperative, also believed that the preparatory work for spring plowing did not have much content, and the problems were not significant, and there was nothing to be done. Under the guidance of this thinking, the work of the cadres is extremely superficial. Three of the nine full-time cadres in the cooperative resigned. Out of the 93 cadres above the production team leader level, 69 were unwilling to be cadres. The broad masses of cooperative members are dissatisfied with the cooperative's failure to implement the policy of "to each according to his work, more work more pay," and their enthusiasm for production is low. In the past, the staff living in the cooperative did not understand these situations in depth.

### 区委书记住在社里也不深入了解具体情况  临桂县花岭农业社备耕工作做得很差

    区委书记住在社里也不深入了解具体情况
    临桂县花岭农业社备耕工作做得很差
    本报讯　广西临桂县两江区花岭社今年的备耕工作搞的很差。
    花岭社共有一千一百九十九户、九千六百四十三亩田，规划规定今年农业要比去年增产20％，副业要比去年增收68％，经济作物要比去年增产更多。但是，目前计划兴修和修补的十五处水利，还没有一处动工；计划1月底烧成石灰一百六十五万斤做肥料，结果只烧得九十万斤，完成计划54％；计划种绿肥五千二百亩，结果只种了三千六百亩，比去年还少七百亩，加以种后管理得不好，整个社的绿肥预计要比去年少40％；其他积肥工作，从去年秋天到现在一直没有搞。褚村素有割草垫栏和积堆肥的习惯，往年冬季，一个生产队要割草二万多斤，积堆肥或沤肥二千余担，这个冬季却没有一个生产队积肥。耕牛死亡和消瘦的情况更是严重。全社八百五十头耕牛，死去四十四头，消瘦得不能用的占所有耕牛的60％。因为这个缘故，春耕中全社将有八百四十一亩田缺乏牛力耕作。农具损失也很严重，全社七百架犁，损坏不能用的就有四百二十多架；全社六百四十五架耙，断折耙齿、损坏耙柱的有一百九十架。另外，全社还缺犁头八百多个，社里对此也未作任何补救的打算。
    花岭社备耕工作搞得不好的主要原因，是由于干部满足于去年增产4％的成绩，滋长着麻痹情绪。领导这个社的乡支部书记就说：“今年上级不强调推广先进技术了，大小麦也比去年种的少，现有几担石灰和粪肥，不积肥也保证增产了”。亲自在这个社指导生产的两江区区委书记周乔保同志，也认为备耕工作内容不多，问题不大，没有什么搞头。在这种思想指导下，工作干部极端漂浮。社里九个脱产干部有三个辞职不干，生产队长以上的干部九十三人，不愿当干部的有六十九人。广大社员对社里没有执行按劳取酬、多劳多得的政策不满，生产情绪低落。这些情况，住社工作人员过去都没有深入了解。
