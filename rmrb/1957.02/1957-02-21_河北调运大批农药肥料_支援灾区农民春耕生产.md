Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 20th -- The Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, based on the characteristic of last year when many areas of the province suffered from flooding, is transferring large quantities of agricultural production materials urgently needed by rural areas to support spring planting.

The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, considering the wet soil and loose earth in the disaster areas, which makes them prone to pests and fertilizer loss, has recently transported more than 44 million jin of pesticides for spring sowing, seed mixing, and controlling above-ground pests, and 64.4 million jin of chemical fertilizers, granular fertilizers, bone meal, miscellaneous fertilizers, etc., to rural areas in disaster-stricken regions. The Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture has also purchased more than 12 million jin of early-maturing crop seeds such as spring wheat, spring barley, and peas, and more than 10 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds from Gansu, Heilongjiang, and other places, and is transporting them to rural areas. Among them, more than 8 million jin of spring wheat seeds have been supplied to agricultural cooperatives. In addition, according to the shortage of draught animals in agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing departments at all levels in Hebei Province have also ordered 30,000 head of draught animals from Inner Mongolia, Jilin, and other places. The supply and marketing cooperatives have also prepared more than 4.3 million pieces of agricultural tools of various sizes to supply agricultural cooperatives damaged by the disaster. In many areas, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have signed contracts with local handicraft production cooperatives to produce agricultural tools, organizing sources of goods locally, purchasing and supplying simultaneously.

    河北调运大批农药肥料
    支援灾区农民春耕生产
    新华社保定20日电　河北省供销合作社根据这个省去年不少地区遭受水灾的特点，正在把大批灾区迫切需要的农业生产资料调往农村，支援春耕生产。
    省供销社根据灾区地湿、土松，容易发生虫害和肥效流失的情况，最近把四千多万斤供春播拌种、除治地上害虫用的农药和六千四百多万斤化学肥料、颗粒肥料、骨粉、杂肥等运到灾区各地农村。河北省农业厅从甘肃、黑龙江等地选购的一千二百多万斤春小麦、春大麦、豌豆等早熟作物良种和一千多万斤优良棉籽，也正往农村调运，其中的八百多万斤春小麦种籽已供应到了农业社。此外，河北省各级供销合作部门根据农业社畜力不足的情况，还到内蒙古、吉林等地订购了三万头耕畜。供销社还准备了四百三十多万件大小农具，供应因灾受损的农业社。许多地区的基层供销社和当地的手工业生产合作社订立了生产农具的合同，就地组织货源，边进货、边供应。
