Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 9th: Soviet Minister of Power Station Construction, Loginov, said at the meeting of the Soviet Supreme Soviet’s Council of the Union on the morning of February 8th that the power enterprises newly built in the Soviet Union in 1956 increased the country's power generation capacity by 4,554,400 kilowatts. This figure is three and a half times more than the total power generation capacity of all power stations in Tsarist Russia. Half of the new turbines put into production were hydraulic turbines. Nearly 7,000 kilometers of transmission lines were laid across the country last year.

    At the meeting of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities that day to discuss the national economic plan and the state budget, many delegates paid close attention to the country's achievements in power construction.

    Deputy Minister of Power Stations, Pavlenko, spoke at the meeting of the Council of Nationalities in the afternoon, talking about the Soviet Union's utilization of the latest achievements in world science and technology in designing new power stations. He went on to say that the power produced by the Ministry of Power Stations in the past year had increased more than threefold compared with the pre-war year of 1940, and 13.6% compared with 1955. As a result, the power supply situation in major industrial cities in the country has greatly improved. Due to the further automation of power stations, the number of power station workers has increased by only 0.5% in the past year, while the power generation capacity has increased by 20%. Power station workers have over-fulfilled the state plan by producing billions of kilowatt-hours of electricity and saving nearly three million tons of fuel through the adoption of new technologies and fuel conservation.

    Lithuanian representative Matulis, in his speech at the meeting of the Council of the Union, focused on the speed of construction of new power stations in this republic, which was established seventeen years ago. He said that during the last Five-Year Plan period, the republic's industrial output increased 1.6 times, and its electricity output increased 1.3 times.

    The representatives who spoke at the two meetings that day unanimously approved the draft national economic plan and budget, and also put forward revisions and supplements, exposing certain oversights in the work of the planning agencies and various ministries, and put forward concrete suggestions on the further development of their respective regions. He emphasized that industrial development should not only focus on new investments, but also pay attention to the more rational utilization of all possibilities and reserves, as well as the role of more extensive development of the principle of democratic centralism in economic management. He said that the Krasnoyarsk Combine Factory produced less than 5,000 combine harvesters in 1955. Since this factory and other enterprises cooperated, it produced 8,000 combine harvesters last year and can produce 10,000 this year. Its production has doubled, but it does not require increased investment.

    苏联发电站利用世界科学技术新成就
    一年来发电能力增加20％，人员只增加0.5％
    据新华社莫斯科9日电　苏联电站建设部长洛吉诺夫8日上午在苏联最高苏维埃联邦院会议上说，苏联1956年新建的动力企业，使全国发电能力增加了四百五十五万四千瓩，这个数字比沙皇俄国全国电站的发电能力多三倍半。新投入生产的涡轮机中水轮机占一半。在去年一年中全国敷设的输电线将近有七千公里长。
    这一天联邦院和民族院讨论国民经济计划和国家预算的会议上，许多代表都很注意国家在动力建设方面的成就。
    电站部副部长巴甫连科下午在民族院会议上发言时谈到了苏联在设计新发电站时利用世界科学技术最新成就的情况。他接着说，电站部在过去一年所出产的电力比战前1940年增加了三倍多，比1955年增加了13.6％。因此国内大工业城市的动力供应情况大大改善了。由于发电站的进一步自动化，一年来发电站的工作人员只增加了0.5％，而发电能力增加了20％。发电站的工作人员在采用新技术、节约燃料方面给国家超计划出产了几十亿度的电力并且储备了近三百万吨燃料。
    立陶宛代表马图利斯在联邦院会议上发言的主要部分谈到了这个成立十七年的共和国建设新电站速度的问题。他说，在上个五年计划时期里，这个共和国的工业产量提高了一点六倍，电力产量提高了一点三倍。
    在这一天两次会议讨论中发言的代表一致同意国民经济计划和预算草案，同时也提出了修正和补充，揭露了计划机关和各部工作中某些疏忽，并且就本地区进一步发展的问题提出了具体建议。他强调指出，工业发展不能光看新的投资，还要注意到更合理地利用一切可能和后备力量以及在管理经济中更广泛地发展民主集中制原则的作用。他说，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克联合机工厂在1955年生产了不到五千台联合机。自从这个工厂和其他企业合作以后，去年就生产了八千台联合机，今年能生产一万台。它的生产提高了一倍，可是并不需要增加投资。
