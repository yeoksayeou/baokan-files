Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 21st (TASS): The Provisional National Committee of the Communist Party USA has issued a statement protesting the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee's subpoena of Dennis.

    The statement pointed out that the proceedings of the CPUSA's National Convention were widely publicized. The statement said: "Every important resolution and vote was immediately released through all news channels. Our resolutions were not only published in newspapers, but a number of non-Communist observers attended the various sessions of the convention."

    The statement also pointed out that if Eastland (Chairman of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee) is concerned about America's "internal security," "we advise his committee to pay attention to the situation in Montgomery, Alabama, and other parts of the South, where the safety of millions of black citizens is threatened by bombs, murder, and various actions of white segregationist committees. Only such an investigation would be in the best interests of American democracy."

    美共抗议国会传讯丹尼斯
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约21日讯：美国共产党临时全国委员会就参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯丹尼斯发表了一个抗议声明。
    声明指出，美国共产党代表大会的会议情况是广泛地公开发表的。声明说：“每一个重要的决议和表决，都利用一切新闻途径立刻发布出去。我们的决议不仅是在报纸上刊载，而且有一批非共产党的观察家出席了代表大会的各次会议。”
    声明还指出，如果伊斯特兰（参议院国内安全小组委员会主席）关心美国的“国内安全”，“我们劝他的委员会最好注意一下亚拉巴马州的蒙哥马利市和南部其他地区的情况，在那些地方千百万黑人公民的安全受到炸弹、谋害、白人破坏委员会的各种行动的威胁。只有这种调查才会符合美国民主的最大利益。”
