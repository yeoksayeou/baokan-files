Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. Representatives attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Conference continued their plenary speeches today.

    A total of twenty-seven people spoke at today's meeting. Most of their reports concerned the achievements and experiences in the construction and production of agricultural cooperatives. The speeches of representatives such as Liu Ying (female), leader of the joint operation machine group of the Heilongjiang State-owned Friendship Farm, Hua La (Mongolian, female), director of the Aiguo Pastoral Production Cooperative in Keshiketeng Banner, Chen Dai, director of the Daqiu Fishery Cooperative on Dongshan Island on the Fujian Front, and He Zhengli, researcher at the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, were warmly welcomed by everyone.

    Liu Ying began learning to drive tractors in Beidahuang at the age of fourteen, and she went to the Friendship Farm when it was first established. Last year, the joint operation machine group she led completed 407 hectares of harvesting tasks, exceeding the original plan by 80%. The tractor's plowing and sowing tasks also exceeded the original plan by more than 300 hectares. Such work efficiency is generally unattainable by joint operation machine groups. In her speech, Hua La introduced the rapid development of animal husbandry after they established the pastoral production cooperative. She said that the pastoral cooperative she leads has more than 4,700 livestock, with 2,000 newborn animals this year. The breeding rate accounts for more than 90% of all female animals, and the survival rate of newborn animals also reaches 90%. This achievement surpasses any year before the organization of the pastoral cooperative.

    In his report, Chen Dai described how their fishery cooperative overcame harassment and sabotage by enemies at sea and attacks from various natural disasters last year, while fishery production still exceeded 1955, and the income of all cooperative members increased. He Zhengli was the first agricultural scientific research worker to speak at the conference in several days. In his speech, he stated that in the future, he would work with agricultural scientific research workers across the country to strengthen the study and research of agricultural science and technology, and to combine scientific research with farmers' production, so as to make greater contributions to the development of agricultural scientific research and agricultural construction.

    At today's meeting, Xia Zhixiang, director of the Changzheng Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Shanghai, introduced the cooperative's experience in implementing vegetable production to serve the city and adjusting production to solve the uneven supply of vegetables during the off-season and peak season.

    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, received the young agricultural labor models attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Conference tonight.

    This morning and at noon, twenty-nine nationally renowned agricultural labor models, including Li Shunda and Geng Changsuo, also went to fourteen units, including the Armored Forces Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Electric Power Design Institute, and Beijing No. 8 Girls' Middle School, to report on their production and construction situations and achievements.

    新华社25日讯　出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的代表今天继续进行大会发言。
    在今天会议上发言的，一共有二十七人。他们报告的大部是属于农业社的建设和生产方面的成绩和经验。其中黑龙江省国营友谊农场联合作业机组组长刘瑛（女）、内蒙古克什克旗爱国牧业生产合作社主任花拉（蒙族、女）、来自福建前线东山岛大?渔业社主任陈歹、华东农业科学研究所研究员何正礼等代表的发言，都受到大家的热烈欢迎。

    陈歹在报告中，叙述了他们的渔业社去年如何战胜海上敌人的骚扰、破坏和各种自然灾害的袭击，而渔业生产仍然超过1955年和全部社员都增加收入的成绩。何正礼是会议几天来第一个发言的农业科学研究工作者，他在发言中，表示今后要和全国农业科学研究工作者一起，加强对农业科学技术的学习和钻研，并且要做到科学研究和农民的生产结合起来，以便为农业科学研究工作的发展和农业建设作出更大的贡献。
    在今天会议上，上海市郊区长征农业社主任夏志祥介绍了这个社怎样贯彻蔬菜生产为城市服务和调整生产解决了蔬菜淡季和旺季供应不匀的经验。
