Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 4th. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long attended a civic welcome rally at Colombo City Hall on the afternoon of the 3rd. As they arrived at City Hall Square at 4:30 p.m., they were accompanied by many soldiers with guns, ethnic musicians, and dancers, who shaded them from the hot tropical sun with two giant mica fans.

They entered City Hall amidst lively drum and horn sounds and the jingling of silverware ornaments of twelve dancers in brightly colored costumes dancing in front of them.

More than 10,000 people stood in front of City Hall for several hours, braving the hot sun, to welcome the Chinese Premier and Vice Premier. Many stood on newly installed fences to prevent the crowd from obstructing traffic, while others stood on the bases of nearby monuments. Many monks wore golden robes that shone brightly in the sunlight, and many women brought large drums, sitting beside them and rapidly beating them with their hands. When the Chinese Premier and Vice Premier arrived, excited voices erupted from the crowd, followed by waves of cheers.

At the entrance to City Hall, Mayor Sugathadasa, wearing a red sash, presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a garland. The Chinese guests were then led into City Hall, where they were introduced to the other hosts of the welcome rally—thirty-three members of the Municipal Council, including three women.

A meeting of the Municipal Council was held immediately in the hall. The Mayor welcomed the Chinese Premier and praised Zhou Enlai's contributions to China, praising him as one of the initiators of Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence). He also said: "Ceylon was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China. Since ancient times, there have been ties of friendship and goodwill between our two countries. This friendship and connection have been strengthened by the trade agreement signed between our two countries. We believe that Your Excellency's visit will help to further strengthen this connection."

In his speech, Zhou Enlai said that when he first passed through Colombo thirty-six years ago, he was impressed by the city's beauty. Now, it is still as beautiful, but the difference is that it is no longer under colonialism. He said, "It will always belong to the people of Ceylon."

Zhou Enlai said that he was deeply moved by the enthusiasm of the Ceylon people. He said, "From the day we arrived, everywhere we went, whether day or night, whether in cities or villages, hundreds and thousands of Ceylon people came out to wave and cheer to welcome us."

Zhou Enlai said that although the two countries have different political systems and may not have exactly the same views on certain international issues, they are the joint formulators of the Five Principles, and the new friendship between them has been developed on the basis of these principles. He said: "I firmly believe that as long as we abide by the principles of the Bandung Conference, the further development of our friendly relations will always have broad prospects."

After the speech, the Chinese guests went outside, where Ceylonese dances were being performed. Zhou Enlai walked towards the cheering crowd and returned their greetings.

At 7 p.m., Premier Zhou Enlai held a reception. Four hundred people attended the reception, including Governor-General Oliver Goonetilleke and Prime Minister Bandaranaike.

After the reception, the Chinese Premier and Vice Premier and their party were invited to attend a state banquet hosted by Governor-General Oliver Goonetilleke.

    科伦坡市民集会热情欢迎中国客人
    周总理举行招待会并应邀参加锡兰总督国宴
    新华社科伦坡4日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在3日下午参加了在科伦坡市政厅举行的市民欢迎会。当他们在下午四时三十分到达市政厅广场时，许多持枪的士兵、民族音乐家和舞蹈家陪着他们，并且打着两把巨大的云母扇为他们遮蔽炎热的热带阳光。
    他们在热闹的鼓号声和十二个穿着鲜艳服装在他们前面跳舞的舞蹈家的银器装饰品的叮铃声中走进市政厅。
    一万多人不顾炎热的阳光在市政厅前站了好几个钟头，等候欢迎中国总理和副总理。许多人站在新设的防止群众妨碍交通的栅栏上，另外一些人站在附近的纪念碑的台基上。许多和尚披着在太阳光下更显得光彩夺目的黄金色袈裟，另外有许多妇女带来了一些大鼓，她们坐在鼓旁，用双手迅速地击鼓。当中国总理和副总理到达的时候，人群中发出了激动的声音，接着是此起彼落的欢呼声。
    在市政厅的大门前，身佩红带的市长苏加塔达萨给周恩来总理戴上了花环。然后，中国客人们被引进了市政厅，在那里，他们被介绍给欢迎会的其他主人——三十三个市政委员会委员，其中有三个妇女。
    在大厅里，立即举行了市政委员会的会议。市长表示欢迎中国总理，并且赞扬周恩来对中国的功绩，赞扬他是潘查希拉的发起人之一。他又说：“锡兰是最先承认中华人民共和国的国家之一。从远古以来，我们两国就存在着友谊和善意的联系。由于我们两国之间签订了贸易协定，这种友谊和联系得到了加强。我们相信，阁下的访问将会有助于进一步加强这种联系。”
    周恩来在讲话中说，当他三十六年前第一次路过科伦坡的时候，他为这个城市的美丽所打动。现在，它仍然是那样美丽，但是不同的是，它已经不再处于殖民主义之下了。他说：“它将永远属于锡兰人民。”
    周恩来说，他深深地为锡兰人民的热情所感动。他说，“从我们到达的那一天起，我们走到的每一个地方，无论在白天或夜晚，无论是城市或乡村，都有成百成千的锡兰人民出来挥手和欢呼来欢迎我们。”
    周恩来说，虽然两国的政治制度不同，两国对某些国际问题的看法可能不完全一样，但是它们是五项原则的共同制订者，它们之间新的友谊就是在这些原则的基础上得以发展的。他说：“我深信，只要我们遵守万隆会议的原则，我们的友好关系的进一步发展就会永远有广阔的前途。”
    在讲话以后，中国客人们走到外面，那里正在表演锡兰的舞蹈。周恩来走向高声欢呼的人群，向他们答礼。
    晚上七时，周恩来总理举行了招待会。出席招待会的有四百人，其中有古?狄莱克总督和班达拉奈克总理。
    会后，中国总理、副总理一行应邀参加古?狄莱克总督所设的国宴。
