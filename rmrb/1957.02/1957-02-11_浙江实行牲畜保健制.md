Xinhua News Agency report: Various agricultural departments in Zhejiang Province are actively helping agricultural cooperatives strengthen livestock healthcare. The majority of traditional Chinese veterinary doctors scattered throughout the province's rural areas have already been organized. In Pinghu and Jiaxing counties of Jiaxing Special District, traditional Chinese veterinary doctors have implemented a healthcare system for agricultural cooperative's oxen. Each ox only requires an annual fee of one yuan, and the traditional Chinese veterinary doctors are responsible for the oxen's epidemic prevention and treatment work, resulting in very few deaths or illnesses among the oxen.

Agricultural departments in various regions are also helping agricultural cooperatives train a large number of epidemic prevention workers and feeders. By the end of last year, the province already had more than 13,000 epidemic prevention workers and feeders with scientific feeding experience and capable of undertaking regular epidemic prevention work.

    浙江实行牲畜保健制
    据新华社讯　浙江省各地农业部门积极帮助农业社加强牲畜的保健工作。散布在全省农村的中兽医大部分都已经组织起来。嘉兴专区平湖、嘉兴等县的中兽医对农业社耕牛实行保健制度，每头耕牛每年只要出一元钱，由中兽医负责耕牛的防疫和治疗工作，耕牛很少死亡或生病。
    各地农业部门还帮助农业社训练大批防疫员和饲养员。到去年年底止，全省已经有一万三千多名有科学饲育经验和能担任经常性防疫工作的防疫员和饲养员。
