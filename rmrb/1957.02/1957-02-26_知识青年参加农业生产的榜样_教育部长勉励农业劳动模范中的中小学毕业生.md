Xinhua News Agency, February 25th – Minister of Education Zhang Xiruo said to ten representatives attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference who are junior high and senior elementary school graduates engaged in agricultural production: "You are not only advanced in production but also advanced in your views on productive labor. You are role models for many junior high and senior elementary school graduates.” He said that in the future, the number of educated youths participating in agricultural production will increase year by year, which will allow agricultural technology to improve rapidly. Zhang Xiruo made these remarks at a symposium held by the Ministry of Education for them today.

Zhang Xiruo said that a country of 600 million people needs modernized agriculture. Building a socialist industrial country also requires modernized agriculture. One of the tasks of general education is to cultivate people with considerable cultural level and technical knowledge to engage in agricultural labor. He said that some educated youths only recognize one path—further education—and are unwilling to engage in productive labor. This is the feudal idea that "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior," which should be changed.

Zhang Xiruo encouraged educated youths engaged in productive labor to continue to learn on the basis of their existing knowledge, to keep up with the ever-changing development of production technology, and to play a leading role in production.

Xu Jianchun, who attended today's symposium, has been engaged in agricultural production since graduating from senior elementary school in 1951. Since 1954, she has served as the director of the Xu Jianchun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yexian County, Shandong Province. Among the more than 1,100 households in the cooperative she leads, there are already more than 150 educated youths. She said that these educated youths have great expectations for agricultural production and mostly have the confidence and determination to run the cooperative well. However, educated youths in rural areas have their worries. They are not satisfied with the little knowledge they have learned from books in the past and are very eager to learn. However, cooperatives often do not make good arrangements for learning, which is one of the reasons why some educated youths cannot wholeheartedly engage in agricultural production. She believes that cooperatives should attach importance to organizing learning and strive to solve difficulties such as learning time and teachers.

Junior high school graduate Hu Zhaokun graduated in 1950. The Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangliu District, Weixian County, Shandong Province, which he leads, achieved a bumper harvest in 1956, with the total income of the cooperative increasing by more than 60% compared to 1955. He said at today's symposium that he would dedicate all his knowledge and strength to the socialist construction of agriculture.

Senior elementary school graduate Ou Zhizhen is a model family member of a soldier. The Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Juxian County, Henan Province, which she leads, has already eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and most of the cooperative's accountants are senior elementary school graduates.

Also participating in today's symposium were Li Fenglan, deputy director of the grain-increasing cooperative—Xitun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longhua, Hebei; Hu Ying, a model pig farmer from Yongji County, Jilin Province; Shen Wenjun, a tractor driver from the western suburbs of Shanghai; and Wei Chengke, Lin Jinrong, and Wu Youlian, outstanding accountants who implemented diligence and thrift in running the cooperative.

    知识青年参加农业生产的榜样
    教育部长勉励农业劳动模范中的中小学毕业生
    新华社25日讯　教育部部长张奚若今天对出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的十位代表、参加农业生产的初中和高小毕业生说：“你们不仅在生产上是先进者，在对待生产劳动的看法上也是先进者。你们是很多初中和高小毕业生的榜样。”他说，今后参加农业生产的知识青年将会一年比一年增多，这样农业技术才可能很快提高。张奚若是在教育部为他们举行的座谈会上说这番话的。
    张奚若说，六亿人民的国家需要现代化的农业。建设社会主义的工业国，也必需有现代化的农业。普通教育的任务之一就是培养出有相当文化水平和技术知识的人去从事农业劳动。他说，有些知识青年只认识一条路——升学，不愿意从事生产劳动，这是“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”的封建思想，应该改变。
    张奚若勉励参加生产劳动的知识青年在已有的知识基础上，继续不断地学习，赶上日新月异的生产技术的发展，在生产上起领导作用。
    出席今天座谈会的徐建春，在1951年高小毕业以后就从事农业生产。她从1954年以来，一直担任山东省掖县徐建春农业生产合作社的主任。她所领导的一千一百多户的合作社中，已经有知识青年一百五十多名。她说，这些知识青年对农业生产的期望很大，大多有把合作社办好的信心和决心。但是，农村知识青年有苦闷。他们不满足于过去书本上所学到的一点知识，要求学习的心情很迫切，而合作社往往在学习上安排得不好，这是一部分知识青年不能安心从事农业生产的原因之一。她认为，合作社应该把组织学习重视起来，努力解决学习时间和教师等困难问题。
    初中毕业生胡兆坤是1950年毕业的。他领导的山东省潍县望留区红星农业生产合作社在1956年获得了丰收，全社的收入比1955年增加了60％多。他今天在座谈会上表示，他要把一切的知识和力量贡献给农业的社会主义建设。
    高小毕业生欧志真是个模范军属。她所领导的河南省雎县和平农业生产合作社，在青壮年中已经扫除了文盲，合作社的会计大多是高小毕业生。
    今天参加座谈会的，还有粮食增产社——河北隆化西屯农业生产合作社的副主任李凤兰、吉林省永吉县的养猪模范胡英、上海市西郊区的拖拉机驾驶员沈文俊、贯彻勤俭办社的优秀会计韦成科、林锦荣、吴友联等。
