    Economic Research Magazine Discusses the Issue of Compensation for Pure Circulation Costs

    For nearly half a year, "Economic Research" has been engaged in a discussion on the "Issue of Compensation for Pure Circulation Costs." Up to now, articles by Jiang Shiyong, Xu Yunan, Fan Hong, Jiang Xuemo, and Song Chengxian have been published successively. From these articles, it can be seen that there are mainly two different opinions on this issue. The first opinion is that the constant capital portion of pure circulation costs can increase the nominal value of commodities and be compensated from prices, while the variable capital portion of pure circulation costs (merchants' advanced wages) cannot increase commodity prices and can only be compensated from surplus value. The second opinion is that the compensation for pure circulation costs, from the perspective of the entire capitalist class, comes from surplus value, while from the perspective of individual capitalists (including commercial capital), it is compensated by raising prices. These two views are not mutually exclusive but can be unified.

    Those who advocate the first view use the furniture in a commercial office as an example to explain the constant capital portion, stating that merchants can either buy ready-made furniture or hire carpenters to make it themselves. Furniture made by carpenters hired by merchants can be regarded as pure circulation costs in the office or sold as commodity furniture. If it is sold as furniture, it can realize a certain price, but if it is regarded as pure circulation costs, it cannot increase the price and must be compensated from the existing surplus value. This shows that the constant capital in the pure circulation costs advanced by the merchant is both the result of production in other production departments and materialized labor, so it can increase the price of commodities, but this is not caused by the increase in real value in production. Therefore, Marx called it the nominal value of commodities. This is an important development of the theory of value when Marx further studied the reality of capitalism and analyzed commercial issues, that is, the socially necessary labor time in commodity production determines the real value of commodities, and the socially necessary labor time in commodity circulation increases the nominal value of commodities.

    When discussing the variable capital portion, they believe that the labor provided by commercial workers is non-productive labor, which does not create value and surplus value, but it functions as necessary labor in circulation. The labor of commercial workers, in its nature, also has necessary labor and surplus labor. The essence of merchants' exploitation of commercial workers lies in the exploitation of workers' surplus labor time. During the surplus labor time, commercial workers realize surplus value for commercial capitalists without compensation. Since commercial workers realize a surplus value equivalent to the value of labor power during the necessary labor time, it can be seen that the variable capital advanced by merchants is compensated from surplus value. However, the role of the law of socially necessary labor in circulation must be considered. Only when the labor of commercial workers employed by merchants is socially necessary can the wages (variable capital) paid by them conform to the general social level. If it is higher than the general level, the excess portion of pure circulation costs will not be compensated, and conversely, it can be supplemented with additional profits.

    Those who advocate the second view believe that Marx's theory on how pure circulation costs should be compensated should be understood in the following three points:

    First, all expenses caused only by changes in the form of commodities (pure circulation costs), whether advanced by industrial capitalists themselves or by merchants, do not increase the value of commodities. Therefore, the existence of pure circulation costs does not increase the value of the total social output.

    Second, from the perspective of the entire capitalist class, all pure circulation costs are wasteful and must be compensated from surplus products or surplus value.

    Third, individual capitalists will add pure circulation costs to the price of commodities and obtain compensation for pure circulation costs from the selling price of commodities. However, the resulting increase in commodity prices is only nominal, that is, there is no real increase in value corresponding to it.

    In the above three points, the so-called pure circulation costs include both the variable capital portion and the constant capital portion. From the perspective of compensation, there is no difference between these two parts. From the perspective of the handling method of the pure circulation cost compensation issue, they believe that after pure circulation costs are incurred, the average profit rate is no longer equal to the total surplus value divided by the total capital, but will be equal to the total surplus value minus the total pure circulation costs divided by the total capital. In the latter ratio, the total capital includes both industrial capital and commercial capital, and commercial capital includes both the capital advanced for purchasing goods and the capital advanced for pure circulation costs. The price at which industrial capitalists sell to merchants, that is, the merchants' purchase price, will be equal to the cost price of the commodity plus the average profit of the industrial capital. The latter is calculated according to the new average profit rate mentioned above. The merchant's selling price will be equal to his purchase price plus the pure circulation costs advanced by him plus the average profit that can be obtained from all his commercial capital. If these pure circulation costs are composed of circulating capital, they will be added entirely to the purchase price; if these pure circulation costs are composed of fixed capital, they will be added to the purchase price of the commodity according to their degree of depreciation. The reason why this scheme can be fully established is that there is a force in capitalist society, and this force is the law of competition and anarchy of production under capitalism.

    Therefore, it is one-sided to say only that pure circulation costs are compensated by surplus value without mentioning how individual capitalists recover the capital they advanced in pure circulation costs from raising commodity prices; or to say only that capitalists want to obtain compensation for pure circulation costs from raising commodity prices without mentioning the ultimate source of compensation for pure circulation costs, both are only looking at the problem from a one-sided perspective. This kind of statement puts things that are not opposed in the first place in opposition. This is a failure to understand the dialectical unity of the two (pure circulation costs compensated by surplus value and pure circulation costs compensated by raising prices), and a failure to understand the dialectical process of unity between the two.

### 经济研究杂志讨论  纯粹流通费用的补偿问题

    纯粹流通费用的补偿问题
    近半年来，“经济研究”就“纯粹流通费用的补偿问题”展开了讨论。到目前为止，先后发表了江诗永、徐毓枬、樊弘、蒋学模和宋承先等人的文章，从这些文章里可以看出，大家对于这个问题，主要有两种不同的意见，第一种意见认为：纯粹流通费用中的不变资本部分能提高商品的名义价值从价格中得到补偿，纯粹流通费用中的可变资本部分（商人垫支的工资）不能提高商品的价格只能从剩余价值中得到补偿。第二种意见认为：纯粹流通费用的补偿从整个资本家阶级看是由剩余价值中得到补偿，从个别资本家看（包括商业资本）是由提高价格得到补偿，这两种看法不是互相对立而是可以统一起来的。
    主张第一种说法的人，在阐明不变资本部分时以商业事务所中的家具为例，说明商人既可以买现成的，也可以自己雇木工来做。商人雇木工做的家具，可以当作事务所中的纯粹流通费用，也可以当作商品家具出卖。如果当作家具出卖就能实现一定的价格，但若当作纯粹流通费用就不能提高价格，而必须由已有的剩余价值中得到补偿。这说明商人所垫支的纯粹流通费用中的不变资本它既是其他生产部门生产的结果，是物化的劳动，就能提高商品的价格，但这又不是起因于生产中现实价值的增加，所以马克思称为商品的名义价值。而这正是马克思在进一步研究资本主义的现实方面，在分析商业问题时对价值理论的重要发展，即：商品生产上社会必要的劳动时间决定商品的现实价值，商品流通中社会必要的劳动时间提高了商品的名义价值。
    在谈到可变资本部分时，他们认为商业工人所提供的劳动是非生产性的劳动，不创造价值与剩余价值，但它是作为流通中必要的劳动来发生作用。商业工人的劳动就其性质说也有必要劳动与剩余劳动之分，商人对商业工人剥削的实质在于剥削工人的剩余劳动时间，在剩余劳动时间中，商业工人无酬地为商业资本家实现剩余价值。既然商业工人在必要劳动时间内实现一个相当于具有劳动力价值大小的剩余价值，那末可见，商人所垫支的可变资本是由剩余价值中得到补偿的。但要考虑到流通中社会必要劳动这一规律的作用，只有当商人所雇用的商业工人的劳动必须是社会必要的，它所支付的工资（可变资本）才能符合于社会一般水平。如果高于一般水平，则多余的这部分纯粹流通费用将得不到补偿，反之则能得到补充利润。
    主张第二种说法的人，认为马克思关于纯粹流通费用应如何补偿这一问题的理论，应作以下三点理解：
    第一，一切仅由商品的形态变化所引起的费用（纯粹流通费用），不论是由产业资本家自己垫支，或由商人垫支，都不增加商品的价值。所以纯粹流通费用的存在，不增加社会总产值的价值。
    第二，从整个资本家阶级看，一切纯粹流通费用都是虚费，都必须从剩余生产物或剩余价值中得到补偿。
    第三，个别资本家都会把纯粹流通费用加在商品的价格上，从商品的售价中得到纯粹流通费用的补偿。但是由此引起的商品价格的提高只是名义的，即没有真正的价值增大与之相应。
    在上述三点中，所谓纯粹流通费用是既包括可变资本部分，也包括不变资本部分。从补偿问题看，这二部分没有什么区别，从纯粹流通费用补偿问题的处理方法看，他们认为有了纯粹流通费用以后，平均利润率不再等于总剩余价值除以总资本，而将等于总剩余价值减去总纯粹流通费用再除以总资本。在后一比例中，总资本包括产业资本和商业资本二者，而商业资本则又包括垫支于进货的资本以及垫支于纯粹流通费用的资本。产业资本家售予商人的价格，也就是商人的进货价格，将等于商品的成本价格加该产业资本的平均利润。后者是按上述新的平均利润率计算出来的。商人的出售价格将等于他的进货价格加他所垫支的纯粹流通费用加他的全部商业资本所能取得的平均利润。如果这些纯粹流通费用是由流动资本构成的，则将全部加在进货价格上；如果这些纯粹流通费用是由固定资本构成的，则将按照其磨损程度，加在商品的进货价格上。这个方案的所以能完全成立，是由于资本主义社会有一种力量，这种力量便是资本主义下竞争和生产无政府状态的规律的作用。
    因此，只说纯粹流通费用由剩余价值补偿，而不提个别资本家如何从提高商品价格收回他在纯粹流通费用上所垫支的资本；或只说资本家要从提高商品价格得到纯粹流通费用的补偿，而不提纯粹流通费用的最终补偿来源，这都是片面的说法，都只从片面的角度看问题。这种说法把本来不是对立的东西对立起来了。这就是不懂得二者（纯粹流通费用由剩余价值补偿和纯粹流通费用由提高价格补偿）的辩证的统一，不懂得二者辩证的统一过程。
