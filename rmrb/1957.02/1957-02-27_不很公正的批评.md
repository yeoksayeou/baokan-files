    Not Very Fair Criticism
    Xiao Shicong

    Recently, some people in the newspapers have been making a criticism, saying that some people writing articles lately like to cite a story from ancient Chinese books, and then make some comments, which has become a new formula. One author even said that the craze for buying ancient books has arisen because of this.

    First of all, I want to say that from one aspect of the matter, namely from opposing formalism, opposing imitation, opposing copying, opposing "following the trend," I unconditionally support this kind of criticism. It wouldn't hurt every writer, whether he is a writer or not, to keep this in mind.

    However, I would like to add that I think this criticism is not entirely fair, or, in a more familiar language, not comprehensive enough.

    How so? The criticism seems to be directed at so-called essays and miscellaneous writings. These kinds of articles, because they are "miscellaneous," inevitably touch on everything from ancient times to the present, from natural sciences to social sciences. If they completely lacked this characteristic, and simply said what I praise and what I oppose, they would be almost like a regular letter to the editor, which would be tedious. I think the main shortcoming of these kinds of articles at present is precisely because the great writers do not participate much in this kind of writing, and most of the people who write them are people with shallow and narrow knowledge (forgive my bluntness, and I ask these comrades to look at this sentence with a humble spirit). Therefore, the vast majority of articles do not have the ability to use our national cultural heritage. Only a few occasionally touch on it, and I think it is far from a problem of an unhealthy trend.

    Citing Greek and Roman examples, citing foreign historical stories, does not seem to have received such treatment. Take the recent essays, short articles, or "talks" of several days, for example, I see more citations of foreign historical stories, and some are quoted very reluctantly, not necessarily much better or more noble than citing domestic historical stories.

    Greek mythology, Aesop's fables, the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Old Testament have been cited for thousands of years in Europe, or among white people. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have cited them countless times, and we are used to seeing them, so we don't find them strange. But on the other hand, when people, especially those who are not from the dusty piles of old books, also begin to cite "ancient books," it is, of course, easy to cause some unease, fearing that they will make mistakes due to their superficial understanding. I think this kind of well-intentioned reminder is good. However, if someone feels at ease seeing thousands upon thousands of foreign historical stories cited, and has a strange feeling seeing a few citations of domestic historical stories, then that is probably a little unfair.

    I think we shouldn't be afraid to use our own things more, as long as they are used well. For example, parables and fables are often quoted from foreign sources, but quoting Chinese fables should not be more distressing than quoting foreign ones. If you don't believe me, take a look at "Ancient Chinese Fables" compiled by the writer Wei Jinzhi and others. They collected parables and satirical stories from several of our "Zi" books and historical books, and rewrote them into five small booklets in vernacular Chinese. Try comparing these things with Aesop's Fables. In quantity, there are more than two hundred, which is quite considerable. In terms of quality, at least ours have these two characteristics: one is the diversity of the materials, rather than simply stories of birds and animals; and the other is that there are very few that are the same, while this situation is quite common in Aesop's Fables. If we can cite them like Greek mythology and the Bible, I don't think we need to be embarrassed at all.

    Therefore, the problem is not that more people should not use them on more occasions, but that they should be used more popularly, more vividly, and more correctly, so that ancient things can also emit a little brilliance for our modern people.

    不很公正的批评
    萧时聪
    最近在报上接连有人提出一种批评，说近来有些人写文章，喜欢从中国古书上引证一个什么故事，然后发点什么议论，这已经成了一种新公式了。有一位作者甚至说，抢购古书的风气，也因之而起。
    我先要说，从事情的一个方面说来，即从反对公式化、反对搬弄、反对东施效颦、反对“一股风”这个方面说来，我是无条件地拥护这一种批评的。每个提笔写作的人，不管他是作家或者不是作家，经常想起这一点不会没有好处的。
    不过，我想补充一点，我觉得这个批评还不完全公正，或者用大家都比较习惯的语言：还不够全面。
    怎么说呢？批评看来是针对所谓小品文和杂感一类文章而说的。这种文章，因为他“杂”，难免要上下古今，从自然科学到社会科学都要扯到一点，如果完全没有这个特点，简单地说我表扬什么、反对什么，又与普通的一篇读者来信差不多，要使人感到枯燥了。我倒觉得，目前这类文章的主要缺点，正是由于大手笔们不大参与这种写作，而写作的人大多数是知识不深不广的人（恕我的直率，请这些同志用一种谦虚的精神来看这一句话吧），因而绝大多数的文章都没有运用我们民族文化遗产的能力，仅仅偶然几篇牵扯到了，我看，也远远谈不到是一种不良的倾向问题。
    引用希腊、罗马，引用外国故实，似乎还没有受到过这样的待遇。就以近来的杂感、小品文、或什么几日谈之类文章来说吧，我看到更多的还是引用外国故实，有些还引得很勉强，不见得比引用本国故实要高明很多，或者高尚许多。
    希腊的神话、伊索的寓言、伊利亚特、奥得赛、旧约在欧洲或者说在白色人种中，引用了成千年了，马、恩、列、斯也不知引用过了多少回，连我们也看惯了，不觉得稀奇。但反过来，看到人们、特别不是从故纸堆中钻出来的人也引用起“古书”来了，这当然就容易引起人们的某种不安，怕他们一知半解出笑话。这种好意的提醒，我以为是好的。不过，如果有人看到引用成千成万的外国故实而心安理得，看到几则引用本国故实的事就发生异样的感觉的话，那恐怕是稍稍有点欠公允的。
    我以为，我们自己的东西，不怕多用，只要用得好。例如，寓言一类东西，外国的自然是常常引用的，但是引用中国的寓言也不见得就要比引用外国的寓言更令人难过些。不信，看看作家魏金枝等人所编译的“中国古代寓言”吧。他们把我国若干“子”书和史书上的寓言和讽喻故事收集起来，用白话改写成了五本小册子。试把这些东西拿来与伊索寓言比一比吧，在量上有二百多则，很是可观。在质上呢，至少我们的还有这么两个特点：一是取材的多样化，而不是单纯的禽鸟故事；二是极少雷同的，而在伊索寓言上这种情形却相当多。如果我们能够把它们像希腊神话、圣经一样地引用起来的话，我想我们是一点也用不着难为情的。
    所以，问题不是不应该有更多的人在更多的场合下使用它们，而是要更通俗、更生动、更正确地使用它们，使古老的东西也为我们现代的人们发出一点光辉来。
