Xinhua News Agency, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee continued its discussion of the Algerian question on the 7th, 8th, and 9th.

    At the meeting on the 7th, representatives from Tunisia, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and other countries successively criticized France's policy of repression, demanding that France grant Algerians the right to independence and self-determination. The Cuban representative, however, repeated the Western powers' assertion that the United Nations should not "interfere" in the Algerian question.

    At the meeting on the 8th, Egyptian representative Omar Lutfi condemned France's policy of force. Subsequently, representatives from Iraq, Ceylon, Sudan, and Yemen spoke, all advocating that France should grant Algeria autonomy.

    At the meeting on the 9th discussing Algeria, Syrian representative Tarazi and Japanese representative Shunichi Kase called for UN intervention to seek a political solution.

    Soviet representative Sobolev stated that the situation existing in Algeria is a direct result of colonial conquest. However, the Algerian people are no longer willing to accept this situation, and these people are actively fighting for independence.

    Sobolev said that France's level-headed political leaders know the true situation in Algeria. The situation in Algeria is constantly deteriorating due to the adoption of retaliatory measures. He said that if we take into account that, with the permission of the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France is able to transfer a considerable number of troops to Algeria, we can say that US military aid enables France to invest new forces against a peace-loving nation. We should draw attention to the fact that this activity demonstrates the aggressive nature of this bloc.

    In his speech, Sobolev also criticized the US policy of infiltration into North Africa. He pointed out that this policy has nothing to do with the national interests of the Algerian people, the interests of the people of other North African countries, or the national interests of France. He also pointed out that American monopoly capitalists are trying to drive out their partners, the British and French colonialists.

    苏联支持阿尔及利亚独立斗争
    亚非国家代表谴责法国镇压政策要求联合国干预
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会7、8、9三日继续讨论阿尔及利亚问题。
    在7日会议上，突尼斯、利比亚、沙特阿拉伯和印度尼西亚等国代表相继指责法国的镇压政策，要求法国给予阿尔及利亚人独立和自决的权利。古巴代表却重复了西方大国硬说联合国不应当“干涉”阿尔及利亚问题的说法。
    在8日会议上，埃及代表欧默尔·卢特菲，谴责了法国的武力政策。接着伊拉克、锡兰、苏丹和也门代表发言，都主张法国应给予阿尔及利亚以自主权。
    在9日讨论阿尔及利亚会议上，叙利亚代表塔拉齐和日本代表加濑俊一要求联合国进行干预，以求得政治解决。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言指出，阿尔及利亚存在的局势，是殖民征服的一种直接的结果。但是阿尔及利亚人民已经不再愿意接受这种局势，这些人民正在积极为独立而斗争。
    索波列夫说，法国头脑冷静的政治领袖们知道阿尔及利亚的真正局势。由于采取了报复措施，阿尔及利亚的局势正在不断恶化。他说，如果我们考虑到这种情况的话，就是由于得到北大西洋公约组织高级司令部的准许，法国能够把相当多的军队调往阿尔及利亚，我们就能够说，美国的军事援助使得法国能够投入新的武力以反对一个爱好和平的民族。我们应该提请注意这一事实，就是这种活动表明了这个集团的侵略性质。
    索波列夫在发言里还指责美国渗入北非的政策。他指出，这种政策同阿尔及利亚人民的民族利益或北非其他国家人民的利益或者法国的民族利益毫无关系。他还指出，美国垄断资本家正在企图把他们自己的合伙人——英国和法国殖民主义者赶出去。
