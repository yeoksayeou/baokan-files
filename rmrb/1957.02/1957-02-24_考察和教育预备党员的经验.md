Experiences in Examining and Educating Probationary Party Members
The CCP Committee of the Lüda Electric Power Bureau

Our bureau currently has 114 probationary party members, accounting for 17.1% of all party members. Over the past year, we have paid attention to the education, examination, and formalization of probationary party members, ensuring that those who have completed their probationary period are able to become full party members on schedule. Our approach is as follows:

I. Ensuring a Good Party Organizational Life

Every probationary party member strictly participates in the party's organizational life from the day they join the party. The party life of our bureau's branches is relatively normal, generally holding a branch meeting once a month, and one or two party group meetings. The meeting content mainly includes discussing production plans and specific measures to ensure the completion of plans, as well as carrying out criticism and self-criticism in conjunction with each party member's work, production, study, and ideological situation. In order to enable probationary party members to be educated and tempered through party life, we pay special attention to allowing probationary party members to express their opinions on various issues at the meeting, or to conduct self-examination conscientiously. We encourage and support the correct opinions put forward by probationary party members and provide patient explanations for incorrect opinions. For those probationary party members who are afraid to express their opinions at the meeting, we send people to have individual talks with them after the meeting, solicit their opinions, and dispel their ideological concerns. Regarding the shortcomings of probationary party members, we help them analyze them, find out the causes, and the methods for correcting them in the future. Due to the frequent development of criticism and self-criticism, the shortcomings of probationary party members can generally be corrected in a timely manner. For example, probationary party member Wang Wenqun, had a very close relationship with the masses before joining the party. After joining the party and becoming the deputy squad leader, deputy secretary of the Youth League branch, and people's supervision correspondent, he became arrogant, thinking that he was superior to others, and picking on the faults of the masses everywhere, and the masses had opinions about him. After this phenomenon was criticized by the party branch meeting, not only Wang Wenqun himself corrected his shortcomings, but other probationary party members with arrogant thoughts were also profoundly educated.

II. Educating and Examining in Work

The tempering of actual work is an effective method to improve the working ability of probationary party members and examine their political qualities. In addition to their own work, we also assign them certain social work. Among the 114 probationary party members, nearly 80% of them are responsible for fixed social work. Some serve in trade union work, some in Youth League work, and some as party propagandists. For probationary party members who do not hold fixed social work, the party organization also frequently assigns them certain work tasks. Such as publicizing the party's policies among the masses, collecting the reactions of the masses, and deepening the understanding of the lives of the masses. The party organization also pays attention to checking their work in a timely manner, explaining work methods, and helping them solve the difficulties encountered in their work. Some branches have also established a regular reporting system for probationary party members. The party committee and general branch also regularly hold small-scale symposiums to listen to their opinions and requirements for the party organization, and teach and encourage them to actively do the work assigned by the party, overcome shortcomings, and continuously improve their level in accordance with the obligations of party members stipulated in the Party Constitution. With the continuous help of the party organization, probationary party members can generally actively complete the tasks assigned to them by the party.

III. Conducting Regular Appraisals

Since 1955, we have implemented a system of regular appraisals for probationary party members, appraising them every 3 months from the date of joining the party. The content of the appraisal mainly includes performance in work and study, relationship with the masses, compliance with discipline, and the development of criticism and self-criticism. During the appraisal, the probationary party member first makes preparations, then conducts an inspection at the group meeting, and after group discussion, writes a written material, which is submitted to the branch committee for review. This can help probationary party members overcome shortcomings in a timely manner and improve their awareness more quickly; on the other hand, it can also serve as an important basis for the party committee to discuss and approve the formalization of probationary party members. In order to do a good job in the appraisal, the party organization should send people to provide specific assistance to probationary party members with more shortcomings before the appraisal. During the appraisal, other party members participating in the appraisal meeting should truthfully point out their shortcomings, patiently help them analyze the root causes of the shortcomings, and find out the methods to correct the shortcomings.

IV. Conducting Frequent Education

We have adopted the following methods to educate probationary party members:

(1) Appointing party introducers to frequently have individual talks with probationary party members to understand the work and ideological situation of probationary party members, and provide assistance and education on the ideological problems they have.

(2) In April 1956, when the party committee held a training class for non-party activists, it absorbed all of the probationary party members at the time (a total of more than 30 people) to participate in the study. During the study period, the focus was on educating probationary party members on basic party knowledge. At the end of the study, a study appraisal was also conducted for the probationary party members who participated in the study.

(3) Probationary party members are absorbed to participate in various current affairs and policy report meetings held by the party committee.
In 1956, such report meetings were generally held once a month.

V. Handling Formalization Procedures in a Timely Manner

New party members who joined the party in 1956 have been formally formalized on schedule after completing their probationary period. There is no phenomenon of delay in our handling of the formalization of probationary party members. This is mainly because the education and examination of probationary party members is done well on a daily basis, and we can be clear about the situation when discussing and approving the formalization of probationary party members. Secondly, the party committee grasps this work relatively tightly, and can frequently urge the branches to discuss the formalization of probationary party members on time, and can also approve the materials for the formalization of probationary party members sent by the branches in a timely manner.

    考察和教育预备党员的经验
    中共旅大电业局委员会
    我局现有预备党员一百一十四名，占全体党员的17.1％。一年来我们注意了对预备党员的教育、考察和转正工作，使预备期满的党员都能按期转为正式党员。我们的做法是这样的：
    一、过好党的组织生活
    每一个预备党员从入党那一天起就严格地参加党的组织生活。我局各支部党的生活是比较正常的，一般都能做到每月召开一次支部大会，一次或两次党的小组会。会议内容主要是讨论生产计划和保证计划完成的具体措施，以及结合每个党员的工作、生产、学习和思想情况，开展批评与自我批评。为了使预备党员能通过党的生活受到教育和锻炼，我们特别注意让预备党员在会上对各种问题提出自己的意见，或认真地进行自我检查。我们对预备党员提出的正确意见予以鼓励和支持，不正确的意见则进行耐心的解释。对那些在会议上不敢发表意见的预备党员，会后派人和他们进行个别谈话，征求他们的意见，解除他们的思想顾虑。对于预备党员的缺点，帮助他们进行分析，找出产生的原因和今后改正的办法。由于经常地开展批评与自我批评，预备党员的缺点一般都能及时地改正。如预备党员王文群，在入党前和群众关系很密切，入党后当了副班长、团支部副书记、人民监察通讯员，就骄傲起来，认为自己高人一等，处处挑群众的毛病，群众对他有意见。这种现象经过党支部大会的批评后，不仅王文群本人改正了缺点，其他有骄傲思想的预备党员也都受到了一次深刻的教育。
    二、在工作中教育和考察
    实际工作的锻炼是提高预备党员工作能力和考察他们的政治品质的有效方法。除本身工作外，我们还分配给他们一定的社会工作。在一百一十四名预备党员中，近80％的人担负了固定的社会工作。有的担任工会工作，有的担任青年团的工作，有的担任党的宣传员。对于未担任固定社会工作的预备党员，党组织也都经常分配给他们一定的工作任务。如在群众中宣传党的政策，收集群众的反映和深入了解群众生活等。党组织也注意及时地检查他们的工作情况，交代工作方法，帮助他们解决工作中遇到的困难。有的支部还建立了预备党员的定期汇报制度。党委和总支还定期召开小型的座谈会，听取他们对党组织的意见和要求，教导和鼓励他们积极地做好党所分配的工作，克服缺点，按照党章规定的党员义务，不断地提高自己的水平。在党组织不断帮助下，预备党员一般地都能积极地完成党所分配给他们的任务。
    三、进行定期鉴定
    从1955年开始，我们对预备党员实行了定期鉴定的制度，自入党之日起每隔3个月鉴定一次。鉴定的内容，主要有工作和学习的表现、群众关系、遵守纪律、开展批评与自我批评等方面。鉴定时首先由预备党员个人做好准备，然后在小组会上进行检查，经过小组讨论，写成书面材料，交支部委员会审查。这样做，一方面可以帮助预备党员及时地克服缺点，更快地提高觉悟；另一方面也可以做为党委在讨论和审批预备党员转正时的重要依据。为了把鉴定做好，在鉴定之前党组织要派人对缺点较多的预备党员进行具体帮助。在鉴定时，参加鉴定会议的其他党员，要实事求是地指出他们的缺点，耐心地帮助他们分析缺点产生的根源，找出改正缺点的办法。
    四、进行经常教育
    我们采取了以下几种方法来对预备党员进行教育：
    （一）指定入党介绍人经常和预备党员进行个别谈话，了解预备党员的工作和思想情况，针对他们思想上存在的问题进行帮助和教育。
    （二）1956年4月党委在举办非党积极分子训练班时，吸收了当时全部的预备党员（共三十多人）参加了学习。在学习期间着重对预备党员进行党的基本知识教育。学习结束时，对参加学习的预备党员还进行了一次学习鉴定。
    （三）党委举办的各种时事政策报告会，都吸收预备党员参加。
    1956年这种报告会一般地每月都能举行一次。
    五、及时办理转正手续
    1956年入党的新党员预备期满的都已按期转为正式党员。我们在处理预备党员转正工作中没有拖延的现象。这主要是由于日常对预备党员的教育考察工作做得较好，在讨论和审批预备党员转为正式党员时，能心中有数。其次党委对这项工作抓得比较紧，能够经常地督促各支部按时讨论预备党员转正的问题，对于各支部送来的预备党员转正的材料，也能做到及时审批。
