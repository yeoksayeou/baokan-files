Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The Beijing Knitwear Factory is improving product specifications based on consumer feedback. After successful improvements, it can save more than 9,000 kilograms of cotton yarn this year.

Women often find that thick-flannel knitwear such as undershirts, Chinese-style shirts, and ribbed trousers don't fit well. Sometimes the waist is right, but the length is too long; sometimes the length is right, but the waist is too tight. This is because these products were produced without differentiating between men and women, with the same size for both. The Beijing Knitwear Factory is now designing men's and women's flannel garments separately, shortening the body length according to women's figures. This allows women to wear well-fitting flannel garments, and the factory can save more than 2,900 kilograms of cotton yarn this year. In addition, the body length of small and medium-sized and large-sized (over 95 cm) of six types of undershirts and vests has also been shortened by one centimeter, as these knitwear items were also considered too long in the past.

They are also improving cutting methods based on actual consumer needs. The legs of cotton ribbed trousers are too wide, so slimming them down allows the cut-off fabric to be used for the crotch, eliminating the need to cut crotch fabric separately. The necklines cut off from spring and autumn shirts and sports vests were previously treated as waste, but are now being used to piece together triangular briefs. This year, the knitwear factory will supply 150 dozens of these inexpensive triangular briefs.

In addition to reducing recycled cotton fibers and modifying the weight of flannel fabric after it comes off the machine, the factory can save more than 9,000 kilograms of cotton yarn this year. This cotton yarn can be used to increase production by 100,800 pieces of undershirts and vests, which are in high demand in the market.

    北京市针织厂改进产品规格
    既适合消费者需要又节约棉纱
    新华社9日讯　北京市针织厂根据消费者的意见，正在改进产品规格；改进成功以后，今年可以节省九千多公斤棉纱。
    妇女买的厚绒的球衫、中式衫、罗口裤等针织品，往往穿着不合适，有的腰围合适，身长长了，有的身长合适，腰围又瘦了。这是因为这几种产品生产的时候男女不分，尺码一样。北京市针织厂现在把男女绒衣分开设计，根据妇女的身材，减短身长，这样妇女既能穿到合身的绒衣，而且工厂今年可以节约两千九百多公斤棉纱。另外，中小号和九十五公分以上大号的六种汗衫、背心也都缩短身长一公分，这几种针织品过去穿起来也都嫌长。
    他们还根据消费者的实际需要改进剪裁方法。棉毛罗口裤，裤腿肥，改瘦一点以后裁下来的布就可以利用来做裤裆，不用另裁裆布。春秋衫、运动背心裁下来的领口，过去都当成废料，现在利用拼成三角裤。今年针织厂将供应一百五十打这种价格便宜的三角裤。
    加上减少回丝、修改绒布下机重量等措施，这个工厂今年可以节约九千多公斤棉纱；这些棉纱可以用来增产十万零八千件市场上很需要的汗背心。
