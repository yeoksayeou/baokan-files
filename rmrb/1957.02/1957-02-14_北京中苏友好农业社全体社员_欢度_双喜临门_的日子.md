Xinhua News Agency, February 13th. All members of the Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative are celebrating today, a day of "double happiness," like a festival—the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the first anniversary of the cooperative's naming.

    More than a thousand members of the cooperative held a celebration meeting. The cooperative's director, Guo Zhen, said at the meeting: We will never forget the cordial help of the Soviet elder brother. Last year, Shavvarov, chairman of the Soviet Stalin Collective Farm, came from afar to personally help us formulate a long-term development plan for the cooperative. In the past year, we have transformed more than 4,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields and planted more than 5,000 fruit trees. Despite suffering from disasters, the cooperative still achieved a bumper harvest, with the average income of each member household increasing by more than 11% compared to 1955. These achievements are inseparable from the help of the Soviet elder brother. The meeting also approved a letter to the Ilyich Collective Farm in the Lenin District of Moscow Oblast, with which they regularly correspond, telling them that they would build their agricultural cooperative as beautifully as the Soviet collective farms in a few years.

    The Beijing China-Soviet Friendship Association and several fraternal cooperatives sent hundreds of representatives to the meeting to offer their congratulations.

    北京中苏友好农业社全体社员
    欢度“双喜临门”的日子
    据新华社13日讯　北京市中苏友好农业生产合作社全体社员像过节一样，欢度今天这个“双喜临门”的日子——中苏友好同盟互助条约签订七周年和该社命名一周年。
    全社一千多个社员举行了庆祝大会。社主任郭振在会上说：我们永远也忘不了苏联老大哥对我们的亲切帮助。在去年，苏联斯大林集体农庄主席沙弗瓦罗夫不远万里而来，亲自帮助我们制定社的发展远景规划。一年来我们把四千多亩旱田变为水田，并且种植了五千多株果树。在遭受灾害的情况下，全社仍获得了丰收，平均每户社员收入比1955年还多11％以上，这些成绩都是和苏联老大哥的帮助分不开的。会上还通过了寄给经常通信的苏联莫斯科州列宁区伊里奇集体农庄的一封信，告诉他们要在几年内把自己的农业社建设得和苏联的集体农庄一样的美好。
    北京市中苏友好协会和各兄弟社派了几百个代表到会祝贺。
