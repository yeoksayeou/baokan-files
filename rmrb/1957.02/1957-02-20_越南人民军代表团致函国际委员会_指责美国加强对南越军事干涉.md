Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 19th. The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, in a recent letter to the International Commission, pointed out that the United States' dispatch of General Carlson to South Vietnam at the end of January to serve as the Deputy Chief of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group "proves that the United States is intensifying its military intervention in South Vietnam and strengthening its military collusion with the South Vietnamese regime, which seriously violates the military clauses of the Geneva Accords."

The United States has established military representative organizations in South Vietnam such as the "Military Assistance Advisory Group," the "Military Training Mission," and the "Combat Training Agency," with a total military personnel of over two thousand.

The Vietnam People's Army Delegation has also recently written a series of letters to the International Commission, accusing the United States of continuously transporting military personnel and war materials into South Vietnam.

According to the materials listed in the letters, the United States transported more than 160 military personnel into South Vietnam by military aircraft in November 1956; and on December 5th and 11th, 1956, ships transported 250 tons of war materials and 1,000 boxes of bomber and military transport aircraft parts into South Vietnam.

    越南人民军代表团致函国际委员会
    指责美国加强对南越军事干涉
    据新华社河内19日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在最近写给国际委员会的信中指出，美国在1月底增派卡尔逊将军到南越充当美国军事援助顾问团副团长一事，“证明美国正在加强对南越的军事干涉，加强同南越政权的军事勾结，严重违反了日内瓦协议中的军事条款”。
    美国在南越设有“军事援助顾问团”，“军事训练代表团”，“作战训练机构”等军事代表组织，全部军事人员已经达到二千多人。
    越南人民军代表团最近还连续写信给国际委员会，指责美国不断把军事人员和战争物资运进南越。
    根据信中列举的材料，美国在1956年11月用军用飞机运入南越一百六十多名军事人员；在1956年12月5日和11日由轮船运入南越二百五十吨战争物资和一千箱轰炸机和军用运输机的配件。
