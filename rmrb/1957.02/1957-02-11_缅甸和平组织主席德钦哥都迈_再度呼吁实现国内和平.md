Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 10th: Chairman of the Burmese Domestic Peace Organization, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, yesterday reiterated his appeal to the Burmese government and underground forces to hold peace talks.

At a press conference, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing said he believes that as long as the warring parties can sit down and negotiate, finding a basis for a ceasefire and lasting peace, it is possible for Burma to achieve peace.

A statement issued by the Burmese Domestic Peace Organization at the press conference pointed out that if neither side is willing to negotiate as a means of achieving peace, there is absolutely no hope for peace in the country.

The statement called on both sides to eliminate distrust and suspicion between them, as this distrust and suspicion undermine the possibility of negotiations.

The Burmese Domestic Peace Organization was established at the end of January this year, with Thakin Kodaw Hmaing as chairman and U Swe Byu as secretary.

    缅甸和平组织主席德钦哥都迈
    再度呼吁实现国内和平
    新华社仰光10日电　缅甸国内和平组织主席德钦哥都迈昨天再度吁请缅甸政府和地下力量进行和平谈判。
    德钦哥都迈在记者招待会上说，他相信，只要交战双方能够坐在一起谈判，为停火和持久和平找到一个基础，缅甸是可能实现和平的。
    缅甸国内和平组织在记者招待会上发表的一篇声明指出，如果双方都不愿进行作为实现和平的手段的谈判的话，国内就完全没有希望实现和平。
    声明要求双方消除彼此之间的不信任和猜疑，因为这种不信任和猜疑破坏了谈判的可能性。
    缅甸国内和平组织是在今年1月底成立的，由德钦哥都迈担任主席，吴瑞彪担任书记。
