Xinhua News Agency, Gyantse, February 25th: The Dalai Lama arrived in Gyantse on the 23rd from Pari.

At a welcoming rally attended by over 20,000 people, the Dalai Lama said: “The Panchen Lama and I were invited to India to participate in the Buddhist conference commemorating the 2,500th anniversary of the Nirvana of the benefactor of Buddhism. After the conference concluded, we also paid homage to various Buddhist holy sites and visited major cities in India.” The Dalai Lama recounted the history of close exchanges between Chinese and Indian Buddhists. He said, "Because the Panchen Lama and I participated in the international Buddhist conference in India, the Buddhist connections between China and India have entered a new era.”

The Dalai Lama said: "During my trip to India, all Tibetan and Han cadres in the Gyantse region united and worked hard to build Tibet. Today, we are gathering together, and we feel extremely excited." The Dalai Lama encouraged the Tibetan and Han cadres in the Gyantse region to make unremitting efforts to gradually consolidate and strengthen the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and within Tibet, and to promote the prosperity and development of Tibet.

When the Dalai Lama arrived in the suburbs of Gyantse at 4:00 PM on the 23rd, two Young Pioneers from Gyantse Elementary School immediately ran up to present him with flowers. Dingjia·Duoje Tangpu, Director of the Gyantse Basic Office of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Ming Fatang, Secretary of the Gyantse Branch of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, presented hadas to the Dalai Lama and accompanied him into a specially set up tent.

The Dalai Lama will stay in Gyantse for eight days, spend the Tibetan New Year, lecture on Buddhist scriptures to monks and lay people, and learn about the work situation in Gyantse.
