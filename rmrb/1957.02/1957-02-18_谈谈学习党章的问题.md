    On the Question of Studying the Party Constitution
    Wang Jue

    The Constitution of the Communist Party of China adopted by the Eighth National Congress of the Party was analyzed and explained by Comrade Deng Xiaoping from various aspects. These analyses and explanations are of great guiding significance for our study of the Party Constitution. Now, I would like to briefly talk about the matters that deserve attention in the study of the Party Constitution, which is the question of what to study and how to study.

    The Party Constitution is the Party's regulations, the ideological foundation of Party building, and also the ideological weapon for the Party to realize its political tasks. Therefore, when studying it, we must conduct in-depth research in a comprehensive manner from all aspects. Whether it is the general program or the details of each chapter, whether it is political principles or organizational principles, we should study it carefully. However, in this study, what are the most important things? I think the most important things are the following points.

    First, the question of the Party's world outlook. The General Program states: "The Communist Party of China takes Marxism-Leninism as its guide to action. Only Marxism-Leninism correctly explains the laws of social development and correctly points out the path to realize socialism and communism. The Party adheres to the Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and historical materialism as its world outlook, and opposes idealism and metaphysics as its world outlook." From this, we can clearly see the important significance of the Party's world outlook. It should be said that in the Party Constitution, like a red thread running through all aspects and playing a guiding role, is the Party's world outlook, which is Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and historical materialism. Therefore, this is the issue we should pay attention to first in our study. Let me give a more obvious example. As long as we compare the Party Constitution adopted by the "Eighth National Congress" with the Party Constitution adopted by the "Seventh National Congress" a little, we can fully see that, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, there is no fundamental difference in principle; but in specific content, there have been many changes, including some changes of a principled nature. The question here is, since the two Party Constitutions do not have fundamental differences in principle, why are there some changes of a principled nature? Obviously, we can see the guiding role of the Party's world outlook from here. It goes without saying that the current situation of our country has undergone fundamental changes compared to the time of the "Seventh National Congress," and the Party's situation has also changed greatly during this period. It is precisely because of this change that the basis for revising the Party Constitution has been formed. That is to say, the situation has changed, and the Party Constitution must adapt to or reflect this change. The question here is, what principle and what guiding ideology make our Party consciously adapt to and reflect this new change? This is the Party's world outlook, which is dialectical materialism. Everyone knows that dialectics insists on the law of the unity of opposites and contradictions of things, and admits that all things are in a state of development and change, while materialism insists that existence is primary and thinking is secondary, and that the subjective must be consistent with the objective. This principle has led to the Party's realistic style of work and the working method of investigation and research. Seeking truth from facts and investigation and research are the concrete application of the dialectical materialist world outlook, epistemology, and methodology in practical work. Certain articles and certain principled revisions of the new Party Constitution are precisely the subjective reflection of the objective dialectics of China's revolution from the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution and construction. This is a correct reflection, that is, a scientific reflection. The changes in certain parts and certain articles of the new Party Constitution are the most vivid manifestation of the Chinese Communist Party's use of the principle of unity of subjective and objective in dialectical materialism to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution. The provisions of the Party's political tasks and organizational principles are closely related to the Party's world outlook. Without paying attention to the issue of the Party's world outlook, it is impossible to obtain a practical or true understanding of the various components of the Party Constitution.

    However, this problem is easily overlooked by some of our comrades, and they cannot often pay attention to the guiding role of the world outlook in practical work. Certain manifestations of subjectivism existing in our Party, whether they appear in the form of dogmatism or empiricism, ultimately violate dialectics, violate materialism, and violate the Marxist-Leninist principles of seeking truth from facts and investigation and research. Facts have proved that: abandoning the Party's world outlook, abandoning the dialectical materialist way of thinking and working methods that a Communist Party member should have, and not solving problems in work through investigation and research and seeking truth from facts, it is obviously impossible not to make subjective mistakes. We often say that we want to improve the ideological level of Party and state cadres, and we are also willing to work hard to improve our ideological level. On the appraisal forms of comrades, we often use this clear phrase to express our wishes. However, what is the sign of the ideological level that we want to improve? The answer can only be the ideological level of Marxism-Leninism, and the most essential thing among them is dialectical materialism, which is the Party's world outlook. The Party calls on us to withstand new tests in the new situation, and to make fewer mistakes or even no mistakes in practical work. Then, acting in accordance with the Party Constitution in all aspects is a very important thing. If we really want to act in accordance with the Party Constitution, striving to study the Party's world outlook and striving to study dialectical materialism cannot but be a fundamental issue. It is precisely in this sense that paying attention to the study of the Party's world outlook is extremely important in the study of the Party Constitution.

    Second, the question of the Party's mass line. The General Program states: "The realization of all the propositions of the Communist Party of China must be achieved through the activities of the Party's organizations and members among the people, and must be achieved through the conscious efforts of the people under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly carry forward the tradition of the mass line in the Party's work." The glorious tradition of the Party's mass line was learned from the great October Revolution. This great creation of the October Revolution is a guideline that all Communists in the world must abide by. Precisely because of the importance of this issue, Comrade Liu Shaoqi in his report at the "Seventh National Congress" and Comrade Deng Xiaoping in his report at the "Eighth National Congress" both regarded it as a key point and made detailed and profound explanations. As everyone knows, when Marx and Engels extended dialectical materialism to the field of social history and scientifically discovered that the development and changes of the social mode of production determine the development and changes of the nature and appearance of society, and that the creators of social wealth and the bearers of revolutionary undertakings—the masses of the people—are the decisive force in the development and changes of history, Marxist historical materialism was born. From the point of view of historical materialism, since human history is the history of producers (and at the same time the history of class struggle in class society), and is the history of the masses of the people, this determines that our Communist Party must resolutely rely on the working class and the working people to carry out great struggles for their thorough liberation. Therefore, when our Party solves the issue of the mass line, the first thing is the issue of serving the people wholeheartedly; and what follows is the working method of the mass line: relying on the conscious efforts of the people under the leadership of the Party, so that the workers can liberate themselves through their own struggle. The former point is relatively easy to achieve among most of our comrades, and most of our comrades are loyal to the cause of the Party and the people. However, the latter point is often not easy for us to achieve. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the Party's traditional experience as: "From the masses, to the masses." Although we recite these eight characters by heart, in actual work, we are often prone to making mistakes on this issue. The main manifestation of this mistake today is bureaucracy and commandism. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report at the "Eighth National Congress": "In many of our state organs, there are bureaucratic phenomena of being high above, not understanding the opinions of subordinates and the masses, suppressing the opinions of subordinates and the masses, and being indifferent to the lives of the masses. This bureaucracy that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality seriously hinders the development of the country's democratic life, hinders the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and hinders the progress of the socialist cause." This kind of bureaucracy cannot correctly come from the masses, and of course it is impossible to correctly go to the masses. This practice of violating the mass line is bound to replace policies with feelings and conduct leadership with wishful thinking. Under this kind of leadership, it is bound to create or foster the commanding style of lower-level cadres. Experience has proved that bureaucracy and commandism are always interconnected. This style always causes errors in work and damages the interests of the people. Of course, it must also be pointed out that another manifestation of violating the mass line is sectarianism. Where there is a manifestation of sectarianism (if it is not resisted and criticized), there can be no mass line, and there can be no good work done. We must understand that if there is sectarianism in the Party, we will inevitably fail to unite the majority of comrades in the Party to work together to do the Party's work well, and if there is sectarianism outside the Party, we will inevitably be divorced from the masses and unable to mobilize the positive factors in all aspects to jointly complete the great cause of revolution and construction. Whether it is sectarianism manifested in exclusiveness within the Party or exclusiveness outside the Party, it can only harm the interests of the country and the people. Whether it is bureaucracy or sectarianism, it is anti-historical materialism, and of course it is also anti-dialectical materialism. For this reason, Comrade Mao Zedong raised the issue of the mass line to the height of epistemology in his article "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" to solve it, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping specifically raised the mass line to the height of the method of cognition (of course, it is also epistemology) in his "Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution" to solve it, which cannot but arouse our deep consideration. Scientifically solving the mass line by raising it to the height of epistemology, and combining the knowledge of the Party and Party members with the revolutionary practice of the masses of the people, this is the most basic and most vivid and concrete application of Marxist dialectical materialism and historical materialism in working methods and leadership methods. The knowledge of our revolutionaries cannot be separated from the practice of the revolutionary struggle of the masses of the people in any case. If we leave it, we will turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, and there will be no question of knowledge at all. The General Program states: "Whether the Party's leadership can remain correct depends on whether the Party can systematically gather the experience and opinions of the masses through analysis and generalization, turn them into the Party's propositions, and then turn them into the masses' own propositions and actions through the Party's propaganda and organization work, and test, supplement, and revise the Party's propositions in the actions of the masses. The responsibility of the Party's leadership is to be good at making the Party's and the masses' understanding constantly improve and the Party's and the people's cause constantly advance in this infinitely repeated process of 'from the masses, to the masses'." This profoundly shows that our knowledge cannot be separated from the practice of the masses for a moment, otherwise our correct knowledge will be blocked and lose its basis, and our wrong knowledge will not be corrected. Therefore, we must closely combine the epistemological principles of Marxism-Leninism with the mass line, or, in other words, we must deeply understand the working methods and leadership methods of the mass line by raising them to the height of epistemology. Only when this problem is solved in our way of thinking can our leadership methods and working methods maintain a historical materialist attitude and effectively overcome the bureaucracy and sectarianism that exist in our work. Obviously, the issue of the mass line is one of the important issues in our study of the Party Constitution.

    Third, the question of the Party's democratic centralism. Democratic centralism is the Party's fundamental organizational principle. At the same time, in order to effectively overcome the mistakes of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, that is, in order to implement Marxist-Leninist epistemology and the leadership methods and working methods of the mass line in the Party's leadership work, adhering to the Party's democratic centralism is of particular importance. The General Program proposes: "The organizational principle of the Communist Party of China is democratic centralism. That is, centralization based on democracy and democracy under the guidance of centralization." The General Program believes that only when the Party's democratic centralism is correctly implemented can the Party's life be full of vitality and the Party's cause be developed greater and faster. Chapter Two further stipulates how the Party implements democratic centralism. Therefore, Party organizations and individual members at all levels must truly attach great importance to this aspect of study in order to implement the principle of democratic centralism in practice. The tendency of excessive centralization in the relationship between higher and lower levels that once appeared in the history of the Party has brought great harm to our cause; and the tendency of decentralism has also appeared at one time. The Party has forcefully opposed these two tendencies and promoted the rapid victory of the Chinese revolution. But today, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, the upper-level organizations' insufficient attention to developing the initiative and creativity of the lower-level organizations is still a major shortcoming. Because of the existence of this shortcoming, the creative power of the broad masses is restricted by having lower-level Party organizations and individual Party members concentrate and mobilize them. Some upper-level organizations do not deeply understand the situation at the lower levels, do not solve problems with lower-level organizations through consultation, and do not summarize the work experience of lower-level organizations in a timely manner to enrich their own leadership experience. Instead, they sit in offices, issue instructions, and subjectively make many rigid regulations to bind the hands and feet of lower levels and force lower levels to execute them. This is equivalent to separating the relationship between the upper-level leading organs and the masses with artificial barriers. This method of hindering and stifling the creativity of lower-level organizations is, in fact, hindering and stifling the creativity of the masses, and thus directly violates the Party's mass line. This is very dangerous. Of course, on the other hand, we also see that there are still some lower-level organizations that lack a sense of centralization, do not ask for instructions or report on major issues, and do not respect the leadership of higher levels. This is also not right. The former tendency violates the principle of centralization based on democracy, and this centralization cannot but make the leading organs an empty shell divorced from the masses; the latter tendency violates the principle of democracy under the guidance of centralization, and this democracy cannot but make the Party's discipline lax and form extreme democracy. Both of these are harmful. Of course, the former tendency is more common at present. Therefore, the stipulations in the Party Constitution that "Party organizations at lower levels must report their work to Party organizations at higher levels regularly. Issues in the work of lower-level organizations that should be decided by higher-level organizations must be promptly requested for instructions from higher levels" are important; and "Party leading organs at all levels must regularly listen to the opinions of lower-level organizations and Party members, study their experience, and promptly solve their problems" are even more important. We must deeply realize that the law of the unity of opposites is the universal law of all things. The life of the Party itself is also governed by this law. The Party's democratic centralism is one of the important manifestations of this law. We must understand the correct relationship between democracy and centralization in the Party's life from a scientific basis based on the fundamental principles of dialectics. As a lower-level organization of the Party, it must, on the one hand, adhere to the principle of the unity of being responsible to the masses and being responsible to the Party, fully develop its creativity and initiative in work, and put forward active suggestions and criticisms that it should have in the shortcomings of work to the Party's upper-level organs. On the other hand, it should also pay close attention to the Party's centralized and unified leadership, which is important in any case. All measures to promote the Party's democracy are not intended to weaken the Party's necessary centralization, but to give it a strong and vibrant foundation. Only in this way can the Party's unified combat strength be strengthened. As an upper-level organization of the Party, it must first pay attention to expanding inner-Party democracy, and fully develop the creativity and initiative of lower-level organizations, and regard it as a major guarantee for us to avoid errors and make fewer errors in leadership and as a source of leadership strength. Facts have proved that the more we expand the necessary democracy, the easier it is to have effective centralization. As leaders, the more we listen to the opinions of subordinates and accept their criticisms and suggestions, to the extent that different views unfold in a comradely and unconstrained debate, the more we can comprehensively reflect the laws of development of objective things and the more clearly we can see all aspects of objective things. This provides a comprehensive and objective basis for our centralized and unified leadership, and makes our leadership easier to be correct and easier to avoid errors. This is precisely what Marxist-Leninist epistemology requires. Of course, on the other hand, we must also pay attention to the tendencies of extreme democratic decentralism that may occur and the behaviors that may damage the Party's principle of centralized leadership. If the Party's upper and lower-level organizations can correctly implement the principle of democratic centralism in this way, it will play a significant role in ensuring the smooth progress of the Party's work in all aspects. Another basic issue for guaranteeing the Party's democratic centralism is the issue of the Party's collective leadership and the issue of the Party's adherence to a sound Party committee system in all aspects of work. Our Party has a good historical tradition in this area, and we should continue to adhere to and carry it forward. In short, we must correctly implement the various aspects of the problem analyzed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in his report. This is a major guarantee for our implementation of the Leninist principle of democratic centralism.

    Fourth, the question of the rights and obligations of Party members. In the new Party Constitution, the obligations of Party members are stipulated as ten items. These ten items include all the contents of the eight standards for Party members that we stipulated in the past, and the requirements for Party members are obviously stricter than in the past. The Party requires Party members to maintain the Party's unity, consolidate the Party's unification, require Party members to actively complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party, strictly abide by the Party Constitution and state laws, and abide by communist morality: all of this is of particularly great significance in today's socialist revolution and construction. What deserves our special attention here is that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report emphasized the importance of Party members being loyal and honest to the Party and not concealing or distorting the truth when explaining this part. He pointed out: "Proceeding from reality and seeking truth from facts is our fundamental position as materialists." This is the most essential thing, and it is also of universal significance for all aspects of Party members' obligations. If a Communist Party member has not solved this fundamental position of a materialist, it will be difficult to fulfill all the obligations of a Communist Party member. This is the first point we should pay attention to when studying. Regarding the rights of Party members, the new content added by the Party Constitution is prominently manifested in the second item, "To make suggestions on the work of the Party; to give full play to creativity in work." Putting such a problem forward as a right of Party members will infinitely stimulate the creative spirit of the broad masses of Party members. This will enable them to give full play to their pioneering spirit, engage in independent thinking, summarize the experience of the masses, and be good at analyzing situations and deciding on countermeasures in difficult and complex situations, and to solve new and difficult problems in work with a clear mind and perseverance within the scope allowed by the Party's discipline in various work positions. Our Party is a Party with great creative ability; and our cause is also a cause with great creativity. Therefore, our Party needs creative Party members in various jobs. On the one hand, they do not exaggerate or be complacent, and on the other hand, they are not conservative or stick to conventions, but have keen observation ability and a pioneering and innovative spirit, and complete all the tasks assigned by the Party under the leadership of the Party. Of course, another aspect of the significance of putting this article forward as a right of Party members cannot but be manifested in its important role in promoting the upsurge of democratic life within the Party. The Party cherishes this right of Party members, and Party members also cherish this right of their own, which cannot but open up a vast realm for the development of democratic life within the Party. This will also play an effective role in promoting the overcoming of bureaucracy and the leadership style of not respecting the creativity of the masses. The rights and obligations of Party members, from the perspective of dialectics, are also the unity of opposites. There is also mutual interaction between the two. Anyone who is good at fulfilling the obligations of Party members will certainly be able to better enjoy the rights of Party members. Conversely, the same is true. In studying the Party Constitution, it will be of great benefit if we can deeply understand the essence and requirements of the obligations and rights of Party members and unify them to comprehensively understand them.

    Finally, I would also like to talk about the question of how to study, that is, the question of learning methods. I think there is only one most fundamental learning method, and that is the Party's traditional learning method—the rectification learning method, that is, the learning method of linking theory with practice. This learning method is effective when used to study theory and policy, and it is equally effective when used to study the Party Constitution. Because the Party Constitution itself is a model of linking theory with practice. It itself excludes dogmatism. Therefore, when we study it, we must study it by using the method of rectification and the method of linking theory with practice. To adhere to the spirit of rectification in learning and closely link theory with practice, we must first make the necessary efforts in the guiding ideology or theoretical basis of the Party Constitution, and first clarify the fundamental principles of the Party's world outlook and the Party's mass line in order to grasp its essence. To solve these problems, it is necessary to carefully study Chairman Mao's opening speech, the part of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report on the Party's leadership, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report. Through the study of these documents, if it is serious rather than sloppy, the problem can be basically solved. On this basis, we can further use these fundamental ideas as a yardstick to link our own work style and ideological reality (of course, we can also link others and link the entire revolutionary experience). Through the method of criticism and self-criticism, reflection and examination, we can analyze and criticize, check our own thoughts, and see which ones meet the requirements of the Party Constitution and which ones violate the requirements of the Party Constitution. If we find that we have subjective, bureaucratic, and sectarian ideological styles, we will resolutely correct and overcome them. In this way, through the study of the Party Constitution, we can further consolidate and enhance Party spirit and further improve the level of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, when studying the Party Constitution, we must resolutely oppose the dogmatic learning method. Because the dogmatic learning method is contrary to the fundamental spirit of the Party Constitution.

    谈谈学习党章的问题
    王觉
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会所通过的党的章程，邓小平同志从各方面作了分析和说明。这些分析和说明，对于我们学习党章具有重大的指导意义。现在，我想简单地谈谈在党章的学习中值得注意的事项，这就是学习什么和怎样学习的问题。
    党的章程，是党的法规，是党的建设的思想基础，同时也是党用以实现自己的政治任务的思想武器。因此，在学习它的时候，必须从各方面全面地进行深入的钻研，不论是总纲以及各章细节，不论是政治原则和组织原则，都应该认真学习。但是，在这个学习中，究竟什么东西是最主要的东西呢？我认为最主要的东西有以下几点。
    第一，关于党的世界观问题。总纲说：“中国共产党以马克思列宁主义作为自己行动的指南。只有马克思列宁主义才正确地说明了社会发展的规律，正确地指出了实现社会主义和共产主义的道路。党坚持马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观，反对唯心主义和形而上学的世界观。”这就可以明白地看出党的世界观的重要意义。应该说，在党的章程中，有如一条红线贯串在一切方面起着指导作用的思想，是党的世界观，是马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。所以，这是我们在学习中应该首先注意的问题。试举一个较为明显的例子。只要我们把“八大”所通过的党章和“七大”所通过的党章稍为比较一下就完全可以看出，正如同邓小平同志所讲的，它并没有根本原则上的不同；但是在具体内容上却有了很多的改变，其中包含一些带有原则性的改变。在这里的问题是，既然两个党章并没有根本原则上的不同，为什么又有一些带有原则性的改变呢？显然从这里就可以看出党的世界观的指导作用。不言自明，当前我们国家的状况比“七大”的时候已经发生了根本变化，而党的状况在这期间也随之而发生了很大的变化，正是由于这种变化，才构成了修改党章的基础。这就是说，情况变化了，党的章程就必须适应，或者说反映这个变化。在这里的问题又是，什么原则、什么指导思想使着我们党必须而且正是自觉地来适应和反映这种新的变化呢？这就是党的世界观，就是辩证唯物主义。大家知道，辩证法是坚持事物的对立的统一的矛盾法则，承认一切事物都是处在发展变化之中的，而唯物主义则又是主张存在是第一性的，思维是第二性的，主观必须和客观相一致。从这种原则导引出了党的实事求是的作风和调查研究的工作方法。实事求是和调查研究，这就是辩证唯物主义的世界观、认识论、方法论在实际工作中的具体运用。对于新的党章的某些条文和某些带有原则性的修改、正是中国革命从新民主主义革命向社会主义革命和建设发展的客观辩证法在主观上的反映。这是正确的反映，也就是科学的反映。新党章的某些部分某些条文的改变，正是中国共产党运用辩证唯物主义的主客观相一致的原理来解决中国革命问题的最鲜明的表现。党的政治任务和组织原则的规定等等都是紧密地和党的世界观联系在一起的。不注意党的世界观的问题，就不可能对于党章的各个组成部分获得切实的或者说是真正的理解。
    可是这个问题却很容易被我们某些同志所忽视，不能在实际工作中经常注意到世界观的指导作用。存在于我们党内的某些主观主义的表现，不管它是以教条主义的形式出现，或是以经验主义的形式出现，归根到底都是违反了辩证法，违反了唯物主义，违反了实事求是、调查研究的马克思列宁主义原则。事实证明：抛开党的世界观，抛开了共产党员应有的辩证唯物主义的思想方法和工作方法，而不是经过调查研究、实事求是地解决工作中的问题，要想不犯主观主义的错误，显然是不可能的。我们经常说，要提高党和国家干部的思想水平，我们也很愿意为提高自己的思想水平而努力，在同志们的鉴定表上，经常使用这种鲜明的字句来表达自己的心愿。可是，我们所要提高的那个思想水平的标志到底是什么呢？回答只能是马克思列宁主义的思想水平，而其中最本质的东西，就是辩证唯物主义，就是党的世界观。党号召我们在新的情况下要经受起新的考验，要在实际工作中少犯错误以至于不犯错误，那末，处处按照党章办事，就是十分重要的事情。而要真正作到按照党章办事的话，努力学习党的世界观，努力学习辩证唯物主义就不能不是一个带有根本性质的问题。正是在这个意义上，注意研究党的世界观，是在党章的学习中极为重要的事情。
    第二，关于党的群众路线问题。总纲上说：“中国共产党的一切主张的实现，都要通过党的组织和党员在人民群众中间的活动，都要通过人民群众在党的领导下的自觉的努力。因此，必须不断地发扬党的工作中的群众路线的传统。”党的群众路线的光辉传统，是从伟大的十月革命学来的。十月革命的这一伟大创造是全世界共产党人所必须遵守的准则。正由于这个问题的重要性，刘少奇同志在“七大”的报告中和邓小平同志在“八大”的报告中都把它当作重点作了详尽的深刻的说明。大家知道，马克思和恩格斯把辩证唯物主义推广运用到社会历史领域中去，科学地发现了社会的生产方式的发展变化决定着社会性质面貌的发展变化，社会财富的创造者和革命事业的负担者——人民群众是历史发展变化的决定性的力量的时候，马克思主义的历史唯物主义就诞生了。从历史唯物主义的观点看来，人类的历史，既然是生产者的历史（在阶级社会里同时又是阶级斗争的历史），是人民群众的历史，这就决定了我们共产党必须坚决地依靠工人阶级和劳动人民来为它们的彻底解放进行巨大的斗争。因此，我们党在解决群众路线问题的时候，首先是全心全意为人民服务的问题；而随之而来的就是群众路线的工作方法：依靠人民群众在党的领导下的自觉努力，使劳动者通过自己的斗争来解放自己。前一点，在我们多数同志中是比较容易作到的，我们大多数同志对于党和人民的事业是忠心耿耿的。而后一点又往往是我们不容易作到的。党中央和毛泽东同志总结党的传统经验为：“从群众中来，到群众中去”，尽管我们把这八个字背得烂熟，可是在实际工作中，往往又容易在这个问题上犯错误。这种错误在今天的主要表现，是官僚主义和命令主义。刘少奇同志在“八大”的政治报告中指出：“在我们的许多国家机关中，存在着高高在上、不了解下级和群众的意见、对于下级和群众的意见加以压制、对于群众生活漠不关心的官僚主义现象。这种脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义，严重地妨碍着国家的民主生活的发展，妨碍着广大群众的积极性的发挥，妨碍着社会主义事业的前进。”这种官僚主义既不能正确地作到从群众中来，当然也就不可能作到正确地到群众中去。这种违反群众路线的作法，势必以感想代替政策，以想当然来进行领导。在这种领导之下，势必造成或助长下级干部的命令主义作风。经验证明：官僚主义和命令主义总是互相联系的。这种作风总是在工作中造成错误，损害人民利益。当然，还必须指出，违反群众路线的另一种表现形式，就是宗派主义。那里有宗派主义的表现（如果不受到抵制和批评的话），那里就不能有群众路线，那里就不可能把工作作好。我们必须懂得：在党内有了宗派主义情绪，势必不能团结党内多数同志，共同努力，把党的工作作好，而在党外有了宗派主义情绪，又势必脱离群众，不能调动各方面的积极因素，共同完成革命和建设大业。无论是表现在党内的排他性和党外的排他性的宗派主义，都只能损害国家和人民的利益。不论是官僚主义还是宗派主义，都是反历史唯物主义的，当然也就都是反辩证唯物主义的。正为此，毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”一文中把群众路线的问题提高到认识论的高度上来解决，邓小平同志在“关于修改党的章程的报告”中，又具体地把群众路线提高到认识方法（当然也就是认识论）上来解决，这是不能不引起我们深思熟虑的。把群众路线提高到认识论的高度上来加以科学的解决，把党和党员的认识和人民群众的革命实践结合起来，这就是马克思主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义在工作方法、领导方法上的最基本地同时又是最生动地具体运用。我们革命者的认识在任何情况下，都是不能离开人民群众革命斗争的实践的，离开了它，我们也就会闭目塞听，根本谈不到什么认识问题。总纲中说：“党的领导能否保持正确，决定于党能否把群众的经验和意见，经过分析和概括，系统地集中起来，变为党的主张，又经过党在群众中的宣传和组织工作，变为群众自己的主张和行动，并且在群众的行动中对党的主张加以检验、补充和修正。党的领导的责任，就是要善于在这个‘从群众中来，到群众中去’的无限反复的过程中，使党和群众的认识不断地提高，使党和人民的事业不断地前进。”这就深刻地说明了，我们的认识一刻也不能离开群众的实践，否则，我们的正确认识就堵塞了泉源，失去了依据，而我们的错误认识也就无法得到纠正。因此，我们必须把马克思列宁主义的认识论原则和群众路线紧密结合起来，或者说，必须把群众路线的工作方法、领导方法提高到认识论的高度上来深刻地理解它。只有在我们的思想方法上解决了这个问题，我们的领导方法、工作方法，才能够保持历史唯物主义的态度，才能够有力地克服存在于我们工作中的官僚主义和宗派主义。显然，关于群众路线问题是我们学习党章的重要问题之一。
    第三，关于党的民主集中制的问题。民主集中制是党的根本的组织原则。同时，为了有效地克服主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义的错误，也就是为了在党的领导工作中贯彻马克思列宁主义的认识论、贯彻群众路线的领导方法、工作方法，坚持党的民主集中制，就具有特别重要的意义。总纲提出：“中国共产党的组织原则是民主集中制。这就是在民主基础上的集中和在集中指导下的民主。”总纲认为：必须正确地贯彻党的民主集中制，党的生活才能生气勃勃，党的事业才能得到更大更快的发展。在第二章中关于党如何贯彻民主集中制又作了明文规定。因此，各级党组织和党员个人，真正要在实践中贯彻民主集中制的原则，就不能不充分重视这一方面的学习。在党的历史上曾经出现过的在上下级关系中的过度集中的偏向，对我们的事业带来了极大的危害；而分散主义的偏向，也曾一度出现过。党有力地反对了这两种偏向，推动中国革命迅速走上胜利。可是在今天，正如邓小平同志所指出的，上级组织对于发扬下级组织的积极性创造性注意不足，还是一个重大的缺点。而由于这个缺点的存在，通过下级党组织和党员个人来集中和发动广大群众的创造力量，就要受到限制。有些上级组织不是深入地了解下情，不是与下级组织通过商量来解决问题，又不是及时地总结下级组织的工作经验，来丰富自己的领导经验，而是坐机关，发指示，主观主义地作出许多硬性规定，束缚下级手脚，勉强下级执行。这就等于使上级领导机关和群众之间的关系，用人工的壁垒隔离开来。这种妨碍和窒息下级组织的创造性的办法，事实上也就是妨碍窒息群众的创造性，从而也就直接违反了党的群众路线。这是十分危险的。当然，另一方面，我们还看到也有某些下级组织缺乏集中的观念，重大问题不请示，不报告，以及不尊重上级领导等现象，还是多少存在着的。这也是不对的。前一种倾向是违反了在民主基础上的集中的原则，而这种集中，就不能不使领导机关成为脱离群众的空架子；后一种倾向又是违反了在集中指导下的民主的原则，而这种民主，就不能不使党的纪律松弛，形成极端民主。这都是有害的。当然，前一种倾向在当前是较多些，因此，在党章中所规定的：“党的下级组织必须定期向上级组织报告工作。下级组织的工作中应当由上级组织决定的问题，必须及时向上级请求指示”，是重要的；而“党的各级领导机关必须经常听取下级组织和党员群众的意见，研究他们的经验，及时地解决他们的问题”更是十分重要的。我们必须深刻地认识到，对立统一的矛盾规律，是任何事物的普遍规律。党的生活本身也同样是受这个规律支配的。党的民主集中制，就是这个规律重要的表现之一。我们必须根据辩证法的根本原理，从科学的基础上来理解民主和集中在党内生活中的正确关系。作为党的下级组织，必须一方面坚持对群众负责和对党负责的一致的原则，充分发扬自己在工作中的创造性和主动精神，对党的上级机关提出积极建议和工作缺点中的应有的批评。另一方面又应该切实注意到党的集中统一的领导，在任何情况下，都是重要的。一切发扬党的民主的措施，都不是为了削弱党的必需的集中，而是为了给它以强大的生气勃勃的基础。只有这样，才能够加强党的统一的战斗力量。作为党的上级组织，就必须首先注意扩大党内民主，充分发挥下级组织的创造性和主动精神，把它看作是我们在领导上避免错误和少犯错误的重大保证和领导力量的源泉。事实证明：越是扩大应有的民主就越是便于有力的集中。作为领导者来说，越是倾听下级的意见，接受他们的批评和建议，以至于使不同的观点展开同志式的无拘束的争论，也就使我们更能够全面地反映客观事物的发展规律，能更清楚地看到客观事物的各个侧面。这就给我们的集中的统一的领导，提供了全面的客观基础，使我们的领导更容易正确，更容易避免错误。这恰恰又是马克思列宁主义的认识论所要求的。当然，另一方面也不能不注意到可能发生的极端民主的分散主义的倾向和可能损害党的集中领导原则的行为。如果党的上下级组织能够这样正确地贯彻民主集中制的原则，对于保证党在各方面的工作的顺利前进将会起着重大作用。保证党的民主集中制的另一基本问题，是党的集体领导问题，是党在各方面工作坚持健全的党委制的问题。我们党在这一方面，是具有优良的历史传统的，我们应该继续坚持和发扬它。总之我们必须对邓小平同志在报告中所分析的各方面的问题加以正确地贯彻。这就是我们贯彻民主集中制的列宁主义原则的重大保证。
    第四，关于党员的权利和义务的问题。在新党章中把党员的义务规定为十项，在这十项中包括了我们过去规定的党员八条标准的全部内容，而且比过去对党员的要求，显然是更加严格了。党要求党员维护党的团结，巩固党的统一，要求党员积极完成党分配给自己的任务，严格遵守党章和国家法令，遵守共产主义道德：这一切在社会主义革命和建设的今天，都具有特别重大的意义。而在这里值得我们特别注意的是邓小平同志的报告在解释这一部分的时候曾经强调指出的：党员必须对党忠诚老实、不隐瞒和歪曲事实真相的重要性。他指出：“从实际出发，实事求是，这是我们唯物主义者的根本立场”。这是最本质的东西，而对于整个党员义务的各项来说，也是具有普遍意义的。共产党员如果是没有解决这个唯物主义者的根本立场问题，也就很难履行共产党员的全部义务。这是我们在学习的时候，应该首先注意到的一点。关于党员权利方面，党章所增加的新内容突出地表现在第二项“对于党的工作提出建议；在工作中充分发挥创造性”的问题上面。把这样的问题当作党员的权利提出来，将会无限地激发广大党员的创造精神。这将使他们在各种工作岗位上，在党的纪律的允许的范围之内，充分发挥首创精神，进行独立思考，总结群众经验，在困难复杂的情况中，善于分析情况，决定对策，有头脑而又有毅力地解决工作中的新问题和困难问题。我们的党是具有伟大创造能力的党；我们的事业也是具有伟大创造性的事业。因之，我们党在各种工作中都需要有具有创造性的党员。他们一方面不夸大，不自满，另一方面又不保守，不墨守成规，而是具有敏锐的观察能力，首创的革新精神，在党的领导下完成党所分配的一切任务。当然把这一条当作党员的权利提出来的另一方面的意义，还不能不表现在它对于促进党内民主生活的高涨将起着重要的作用。党珍视党员的这一项权利，党员也珍视自己的这一项权利，那就不能不对于发展党内民主生活，开辟着广大的境界。这对于克服官僚主义，克服不尊重群众创造的领导作风来说，也就起着有效的推动作用。党员的权利和义务，用辩证法的观点看来，也是对立的统一体。两者之间也是起着相互作用的。凡是善于履行党员义务的人就一定能更好地享受党员的权利。反之，也正相同。我们在学习党章的时候，能深刻理解党员的义务和权利的本质和要求，而又能把它们统一起来加以全面领会，是将会收到很大益处的。
    最后，我还想谈一下怎样学的问题，也就是关于学习方法的问题。我想最根本的学习方法只有一条，那就是党的传统的学习方法——整风的学习方法，也就是理论联系实际的学习方法。这种学习方法，用之于理论、政策的学习是有效的，用之于党章的学习也同样是有效的。因为党章本身，就是理论联系实际的典范。它本身就是排斥教条主义的。因此，我们在学习它的时候就必须用整风的方法、理论联系实际的方法来学习它。要在学习中坚持整风的精神，把理论和实际密切联系起来，就必须首先从党章的指导思想或者说是理论基础方面下必要的工夫，首先弄清党的世界观和党的群众路线的根本原则，以便掌握它的精神实质。要解决这些问题，认真地研究一下毛主席的开幕词、刘少奇同志政治报告的党的领导部分以及邓小平同志的报告是必要的。通过这些文件的学习，如果是认真的而不是马虎的，就可以基本上解决问题。在这个基础之上就可以进一步以这些根本思想作尺度，来联系自己的工作作风和思想实际（当然也可以联系别人，联系整个的革命经验）。通过批评和自我批评、反省和检查的方法，进行分析批判，检查自己的思想，看看哪些是符合党章的要求而哪些又是违反党章的要求的。如果发现自己有主观主义官僚主义宗派主义的思想作风，就坚决地加以改正和克服。这样就可以通过党章的学习，进一步地巩固和增强党性，进一步地提高马克思列宁主义水平。因此，在学习党章的时候，必须坚决反对教条主义的学习方法。因为，教条主义的学习方法是和党章的根本精神相违反的。
