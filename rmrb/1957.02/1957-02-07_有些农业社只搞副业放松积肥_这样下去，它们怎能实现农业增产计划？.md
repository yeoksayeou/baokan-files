Some Agricultural Cooperatives Only Focus on Sideline Occupations and Neglect Manure Accumulation
How Can They Achieve Their Agricultural Production Increase Plans Like This?
    (Our Dispatch) The current situation in many areas is that some agricultural cooperatives are only concerned with engaging in sideline occupations and are neglecting manure accumulation. According to the Xinjiang Daily, the Anningqu Agricultural Cooperative in Anningqu District, Urumqi County, has been doing far less manure accumulation work this winter and spring than in previous years. They have invested the vast majority of their labor in sideline production, neglecting manure accumulation. The cooperative has 547 male laborers, with 362 regularly working, an attendance rate of just over 66%. However, 239 of these laborers are used for sideline production, accounting for more than 63% of the attendance rate, while only ten are used for manure accumulation, accounting for just over 2.7% of the attendance rate. The cooperative's 57 large carts and 213 horses are also almost entirely used for sideline occupations. Originally, the 230 cattle could have been used to pull plows for manure accumulation, but they were not utilized either. Because the main labor force and animal power were not used for manure accumulation, the cooperative accumulated very little fertilizer. In the past six months, the cooperative has only accumulated more than 1,600 cartloads of manure. This year, the cooperative plans to plant more than 2,800 mu of melons and vegetables, which, at 2.5 cartloads of fertilizer per mu, requires more than 7,000 cartloads of fertilizer. In addition, there are more than 11,700 mu of wheat and corn, which, at one cartload per mu, requires more than 10,000 cartloads of fertilizer. According to the current amount of manure accumulation, there is still a shortage of more than 10,000 cartloads. In other areas, some agricultural cooperatives have also experienced similar situations.
    If these agricultural cooperatives do not quickly correct the tendency of emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting manure accumulation, it will affect the completion of this year's production increase plan.

    有些农业社只搞副业放松积肥
    这样下去，它们怎能实现农业增产计划？
    本报讯　目前许多地方都有一些农业社只顾经营副业，放松了积肥工作。据新疆日报报道：乌鲁木齐县安宁渠区安宁渠农业社，去冬和今春积肥工作远不及往年，他们把绝大部分力量投入副业生产，忽视了积肥。全社有男劳动力五百四十七个，经常干活的有三百六十二个，出勤率为66％强。但这些劳动力用于副业生产的就有二百三十九个，占出勤率的63％多，而用于积肥的只有十个，占出勤率的2.7％多；社的五十七辆大车和二百一十三匹马也几乎全部用在副业上面；本来二百三十头牛是可以拉耙犁积肥的，但也没有利用起来。由于主要劳力、畜力没有用于积肥工作，社里积的肥料十分少。半年来全社只积肥一千六百多车。全社今年计划种植瓜菜二千八百多亩，每亩以二车半肥料计算，就需肥七千多车；另外还有小麦、玉米一万一千七百多亩，每亩以一车计算也需肥一万多车。按目前积肥量来看离需肥量还差一万多车。在别的地区，也有一些农业社发生了类似的情况。
    这些农业社如果不迅速纠正重副业轻积肥的偏向，就会影响今年增产计划的完成。
