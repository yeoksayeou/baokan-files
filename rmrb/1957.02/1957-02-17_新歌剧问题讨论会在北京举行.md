    New Opera Issues Symposium Held in Beijing

    (Our report) The New Opera Issues Symposium, jointly organized by the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Chinese Musicians Association, began in Beijing on the 15th.

    New opera is the youngest genre among China's many opera forms. However, it already has a broad impact among the masses. Some excellent small-scale Yangko operas and the large-scale new opera "The White Haired Girl," which originated in the anti-Japanese base areas, were not only warmly welcomed in cities and villages across the country, but also won international recognition. After liberation, new opera developed under new circumstances and conditions. In creating new socialist national operas, new opera workers have made many brave explorations and attempts, learning from national and folk traditions on the one hand, and from foreign operas on the other. Over the past seven or eight years, more than ten influential large-scale works have been created and performed, including "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "A Spark Can Start a Fire," "The Long March," "Liu Hulan," "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," "Song of the Grassland," "The Volunteer Army's Fiancee," "Hero's Song of the Jialing River," and "Spring Flowers are Blooming." In addition, there are many small-scale operas that are often performed in rural areas and factories.

    New opera also faces many difficulties and problems in its development path. At this academic symposium, more than 160 opera writers, poets, composers, directors, actors, and stage artists from all over the country will engage in extensive and free discussions on issues such as the foundation and direction of new opera, the artistic characteristics of new opera, and the work and career development of opera troupes (theaters). The symposium is scheduled to end on March 5th.

    新歌剧问题讨论会在北京举行
    本报讯　中国戏剧家协会和中国音乐家协会联合举办的新歌剧问题讨论会，15日起在北京举行。
    新歌剧是我国众多的剧种中间最年轻的一个剧种。但是它在群众中已经有了广泛的影响。在抗日根据地产生的一些优秀的小型秧歌剧及大型的新歌剧“白毛女”等，不仅在全国城市和乡村受到热烈欢迎，而且也赢得了国际声誉。解放以后，新歌剧在新的情况和新的条件下发展着。在创造社会主义的民族的新歌剧方面，新歌剧工作者们一面向民族和民间的传统学习，一面向外国歌剧学习，作了许多勇敢的探索与尝试。七八年来，先后创作和演出了“王贵与李香香”“星星之火”“长征”“刘胡兰”“小二黑结婚”“草原之歌”“志愿军的未婚妻”“嘉陵江英雄歌”“迎春花开了”等十余部有影响的大型作品。此外还有许多小型歌剧，经常在农村和工厂演出。
    新歌剧在自己的发展道路上也存在着许多困难和问题。在这次学术性的讨论会上，来自全国各地的一百六十多位歌剧作家、诗人、作曲家、导演、演员和舞台美术家等，将就新歌剧的基础和方向、新歌剧的艺术特征、歌剧团（院）的工作和事业发展等问题，展开广泛的自由的争论。讨论会预定3月5日结束。
