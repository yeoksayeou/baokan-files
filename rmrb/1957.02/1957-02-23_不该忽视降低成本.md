    Cost Reduction Should Not Be Neglected
    Many leading personnel in the Northwest Second Engineering Company do not pay enough attention to the work of reducing costs. For example, Director Ji of the Fourth Engineering Area’s processing plant said to the workers: "It doesn't matter if the cost reduction plan is not completed, but if the progress of the project is not completed, you will be spanked." Some engineering areas do not even prepare monthly cost reduction plans. The company manager once assigned the entire responsibility for cost reduction to the finance section. Later, an instruction from the Ministry of Construction Engineering stipulated that the planning department should take the lead in preparing cost reduction plans, and the two departments then shirked responsibility to each other, failing to focus on cost reduction work. This situation should be corrected quickly.

    不该忽视降低成本
    西北第二工程公司不少领导人员对降低成本工作不够重视。如第四工区加工厂姬主任向职工说：“降低成本计划完不成不要紧，工程进度完不成就要打屁股。”有的工区连降低成本的月计划都不编。公司经理曾经把降低成本的工作让财务科全部负责，后来建筑工程部来的指示规定编制降低成本计划以计划部门为主，这两个部门就互相推诿，没有抓紧降低成本工作。这种情况应该赶快纠正。
