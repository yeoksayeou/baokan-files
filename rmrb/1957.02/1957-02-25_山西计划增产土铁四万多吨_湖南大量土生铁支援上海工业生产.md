Xinhua News Agency report: Shanxi Province's Handicraft Iron Industry Cooperative plans to increase the production of native iron by more than 47,500 tons this year. After this plan is completed, the province's native iron production will increase by more than 80% compared to last year.

The province currently has more than 230 handicraft native iron production cooperatives, distributed in southeastern Shanxi, central Shanxi, and western Shanxi. In order to complete this year's native iron production increase task without increasing existing equipment, this meeting studied specific measures to fully utilize existing production equipment. Yangquan City, which has the largest production capacity in the province, has 20 native iron production cooperatives. By exploring the unused load capacity of existing machinery and equipment, it can drive ten more round furnaces and increase the production of native iron by more than 3,800 tons. In Changzhi, Jincheng, Yu County, Puding and other places, handicraft iron industry cooperatives have different furnace sizes and varying numbers of iron melting pots. Where there are fewer iron melting pots, there is a waste of manpower. If these areas add some more iron melting pots, they can greatly increase output and increase the state's annual production by 650 tons of native iron. In addition, after investigating the existing equipment in various places throughout the province, six small blast furnaces with an annual output of 6,100 tons will be built in Yangquan and other places with suitable conditions to produce native iron.

Shanxi is known throughout the country as the "land of coal and iron," and its native iron resources are abundant. Over the years, Shanxi's native iron, from raw materials to finished products, has been a very important supplement for the country. In addition to meeting the needs of the province, it is also loved by farmers in neighboring provinces and sells very well.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 24th: On February 19th, Shanghai received another batch of native pig iron from Hunan. Together with the past nine months, the amount of native pig iron shipped from Hunan to Shanghai has reached more than 5,800 tons. The native pig iron supplied to Shanghai is refined by more than 50 pig iron plants scattered in the mountainous areas of Hunan using indigenous methods.

Many factories in Shanghai use native pig iron to overcome the difficulty of insufficient pig iron supply. More than 200 factories producing sewing machines, pens, and other products have adopted native pig iron transported from Hunan, and the product quality remains good.

    山西计划增产土铁四万多吨
    湖南大量土生铁支援上海工业生产
    据新华社讯　山西省手工铁业合作社计划今年增产土铁四万七千五百多吨。这个计划完成后，全省土铁产量就可比去年增产80％以上。
    全省现有二百三十多个手工土铁生产合作社，分布在晋东南、晋中和晋西等地。为了在不增加现有设备的情况下完成今年土铁增产任务，这次会议研究了充分利用现有生产设备的具体措施。全省生产能力最大的阳泉市有二十个土铁生产合作社，从现有的机器设备中找寻出未被利用起来的负荷能力，就可多带动十个圆炉，增产土铁三千八百多吨。长治、晋城、盂县和平定等地的手工铁业合作社，炉子大小不同熔铁锅多少不一，熔铁锅少的地方就有人力的浪费现象；这些地区如果再增加一部分熔铁锅，就可大大提高产量，全年为国家增产六百五十吨土铁。另外，全省在调查了各地现有设备后，还将在阳泉等有条件的地方，增建年产六千一百吨的六座小高炉，生产土铁。
    山西以“煤铁之乡”在全国著称，土铁资源蕴藏丰富。历年来，山西的土铁从原料到成品都一直是国家一部分极重要的补助，除供本省需用外，且为邻省农民所喜爱，销路很畅。
    新华社上海24日电　2月19日，上海又从湖南运到了一批土生铁，连同过去九个多月，从湖南运到上海的土生铁已经有五千八百多吨。供应上海的这些土生铁，是散处在湖南各地山区的五十多个生铁厂用土法炼制出来的。
    上海许多工厂以土生铁来克服生铁供应不足的困难，有二百多家制缝纫机、制笔等工厂采用了湖南运来的土生铁，产品质量仍然保持良好。
