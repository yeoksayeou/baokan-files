	“Development Perspective”
	Tian Ge

	Here's a joke: A beggar tells someone that if he ever becomes rich, he'll buy a gold bowl to beg for alms.

	The humor in this joke lies in the beggar's inability to foresee the new circumstances that would inevitably arise after becoming wealthy. In today's language, it's a lack of a "development perspective."

	However, I am even more concerned about the "development perspective" that is divorced from the foundation of reality, so let me start with another funny story: Next door to where I live, there is an old lady who sews new clothes for her five-year-old granddaughter all day long without stopping. Unfortunately, these new clothes are always too long and too big. When the granddaughter wears them, they are baggy and awkward, neither beautiful nor convenient. People advised the old lady to make them smaller, but the old lady said: "I deliberately make them bigger. Children grow fast. They don't fit now, but they will fit after a while." This old lady can be considered to have a "development perspective," right? But what is the reality? By the time the child grows to fit the new clothes, the new clothes are already worn out and old, and she has to change into another newer, longer and larger piece of clothing. As a result, although this granddaughter always has new clothes to wear, she never wears clothes that fit properly, and she always looks clumsy and ridiculous.

	In some of our work, isn't there this kind of old lady-style "development perspective"! I have read several books that guide rural cultural work. One of them is to guide agricultural cooperatives on how to run libraries, and the other is to guide agricultural cooperatives on how to run kindergartens. The book on running libraries proposes how to classify, catalog, how to fill out cards, how to use newspaper clips, and even some library rules. The book on running kindergartens proposes a timetable for children entering the kindergarten: there are regulations for entering the kindergarten at 7:30 in the morning, as well as regulations for afternoon naps; even the size of the wooden horse for children to play on, and the size of the limbs of the dolls, are all stipulated. Obviously, these guidelines are divorced from the actual situation of general agricultural cooperatives in rural areas today. It merely recommends the scale and practices of certain libraries and kindergartens in the city. However, some people believe that it should be examined from a development perspective, saying that agricultural cooperatives may not be able to do this now when running libraries and kindergartens, but they will be able to do so in the future. I wonder, when general agricultural cooperatives have the conditions to run libraries and kindergartens in that way, is it necessary to run them that way? Furthermore, if these kinds of books are to be preserved until the future, aren't you afraid of them being damaged and worn out?

	A few days ago, some comrades, regarding the problem of the shortage and poor quality of book publishing, questioned whether it was too much that each province had established a publishing house. At this time, another comrade cited a certain European country with a population of only tens of millions, which is only the population of one of our provinces, but they have hundreds of publishing houses. His point is that one publishing house per province is only too few, not too many. Even if the conditions (manpower and actual needs) are not enough now, we should look at the problem from a "development perspective." Of course, it is not necessarily too many to have a publishing house in each province now; but if it is said that the establishment of publishing houses in each province is only considered from a "development perspective," then it becomes a problem. We don't have to hide the fact that our people's cultural life is far behind that of some European countries.

	There are similar examples. I heard that a station was designed in a certain village that could accommodate the entire village's population, the reason being that it started from a "development perspective"; a factory has a small number of people, but a large auditorium was built that can accommodate three times the number of people in the factory, and the reason is also that it started from a "development perspective." …

	A development perspective is very necessary, but it must be based on the foundation of reality, and we must correctly foresee the possible future developments from this foundation.

	We should examine the institutions established and the work done under the so-called "development perspective." In particular, we must oppose using the "development perspective" as a reason to defend the bloatedness of institutions and the errors in work.

    “发展观点”
    天戈
    这是笑话：有个乞丐对人说，他要是发了财，他一定要买个金饭碗去讨饭。
    这个笑话之令人发笑，在于乞丐不能预察到发财后必然发生的新情况。拿现在的话来说，是缺乏
  “发展观点”。
    但是我更有感于脱离现实基础的“发展观点”，也先以一个好笑的事情为例：在我住所隔壁，有个老太婆整天不停手地给她的五岁孙女缝制新衣。可惜这些新衣总是又长又大，孙女穿了，拖拖沓沓，既不美观，又不方便。人家劝老太婆做得小些，老太婆说：“我特意做大的。孩子长得快，现在不合穿，过些时候就合穿了。”这老太婆算是有“发展观点”了吧！可是实际呢？等孩子长到合穿那件新衣的时候，新衣早已又破又旧，不得不另换一件更长更大的新衣了。结果这孙女虽然老是有新衣裳穿，可老是穿不到合适的，老是显得笨拙可笑。
    在我们的一些工作中，又何尝没有这种老太婆式的“发展观点”！我曾翻阅了几本指导农村文化工作的书籍，其中有一本是指导农业社怎样办图书室的，另一本是指导农业社怎样办幼儿园的。关于办图书室的书中，提出了怎样分类、编目，怎样填写卡片，怎样使用报夹子，以至一些图书室的规则等等。关于办幼儿园的书，提出了入园儿童的作息时间表：有上午七时半入园的规定，也有午睡的规定；甚至儿童玩的木马该有多大，洋娃娃的手脚尺寸，都作了规定。很显然，这些指导是脱离现在农村一般农业社的实际情况的。它只是推荐城市某些图书室和幼儿园的规模和做法而已。可是，有人认为应该从发展观点来考察，说现在农业社办图书室和幼儿园不一定能做到这样，但将来是可以做到的。我想，等到一般农业社都有条件按照那样子办图书室和幼儿园的时候，是不是非按那样子办不可？再说，这类书籍要保存到将来，就不怕损失破旧么？
    早几天，有同志就书籍出版又缺又滥的问题，怀疑到现在各省都设立了出版社是否太多了。这时，另外有同志就举出欧洲某个国家，人口不过几千万，仅及我们一个省的人口，而他们的出版社就上百个。他的意思是，一个省一个出版社，只少不多，现在即使条件（人力和实际需要）不够，可应该从“发展观点”来看问题。当然，现在各省有一个出版社，不一定就是多；但是如果说，各省设立出版社，仅是从“发展观点”着想，那是成了问题的。我们不必隐瞒这个事实，即我们人民文化生活还远落后于欧洲某些国家。
    类似的例子还有。听说在某乡村设计了一个车站，竟可容纳全村的人口，理由是从“发展观点”出发；某工厂人数不多，可是盖起了可以容纳全厂三倍人数的大礼堂，理由也是从“发展观点”出发。……
    发展观点是很需要的，但是必须根据现实基础，并且要从这个基础正确地预察将来可能的发展情况。
    我们应该检查一下所谓从“发展观点”来设立的机构和做过的工作。特别要反对以“发展观点”为理由，去为机构的臃肿和工作中的差错作辩护。
