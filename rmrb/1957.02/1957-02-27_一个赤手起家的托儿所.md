The growth of the Kunwei Road Subdistrict Nursery in Tianjin, established by six housewives, is now a model for running nurseries diligently and thriftily in Tianjin.

As soon as the reporter entered the fenced courtyard of the nursery, the children's singing wafted through the air. The director, Zhang Shuyun, received the reporter in a bright and warm children's playroom. In this simple and clean room, the walls were covered with numerous certificates of merit and banners presented by the District People's Committee and other units. The children, who had just finished singing, were sitting around small tables waiting for their afternoon snacks. The inner room of the playroom was the children's rest room, where two rows of beds for the children's naps were covered with clean, light blue sheets, and floral quilts were neatly folded at one end. This scene made it hard to believe that this children's paradise, currently home to thirty-five children, had once been a dilapidated shed unwanted by a freight yard.

This nursery, organized in 1952, was one of the earliest nurseries in Tianjin established by the masses themselves. At that time, there were no nurseries in the Kunwei Road area, and many couples who were working had no one to take care of their children. Some enthusiastic housewives, in order to solve the difficulties of these children's parents, began to plan a small nursery. When the Public Security Bureau police station helped them find a broken shed and two grass curtains, and neighbors lent them some bed boards and furniture, they immediately took in eight children. The spirit of these housewives in being enthusiastic about public welfare immediately received the support of relevant government departments and people from all walks of life: the Municipal Housing Company repaired the house for them; construction workers among the neighbors volunteered to help them build a children's bathroom and toilet on holidays; an electrician living nearby helped them install electric lights; and carpenters charged half price to make slides, swings and other toys for the children. Some neighbors also donated or sold lumber to the nursery at low prices, and lent their houses to the "small class" children as rest rooms.

After receiving support from relevant departments and people from all walks of life, the founders still calculated carefully and paid great attention to diligence and thrift. They voluntarily waived their salaries in the early stages and used their spare time to pick up broken bricks from rubble piles as materials for repairing the house. After the nursery officially opened, thanks to their efforts, although the monthly childcare fee for each child was only 11.5 yuan, which was 4 or 5 yuan lower than that of ordinary nurseries, the children could eat meat or eggs every day, as well as fruit and snacks once a day. Zhang Shuyun said: "Because everyone is diligent and thrifty, the nursery now has more than 400 yuan in savings, and plans to build two more houses this year to help more mothers solve the problem of childcare."

The six housewives who founded the nursery only had a second or third grade elementary school education. In order to learn childcare knowledge, they insisted on participating in childcare knowledge lectures held by the district health department, and also attended a cultural class every other day. They didn't know how to teach the children to play games, so they followed the children from other nurseries to the park to learn; they didn't know how to sing, so they went to the windows of the music classroom of a nearby elementary school to listen, or asked elementary school students to teach them.

The parents expressed infinite gratitude and respect for the hard work of the caregivers, often visiting them on holidays or inviting them to their homes as guests. Just as the reporter was about to leave, Du Fenglan, a female worker from the Tianjin Rubber Hose Factory, came to pick up her daughter, Du Jinru. She pointed to the rosy-cheeked little girl and said to the reporter: "Jinru has never been sick in the nearly one year she has been at the nursery, and she has grown much fatter than before; she also understands many things. The aunts are so good to the children!"

    一个赤手起家的托儿所
    新华社记者  卢锡珪
    由六个家庭妇女兴办起来的天津市昆纬路街道托儿所的成长过程，现在成为天津市勤俭办托儿事业的榜样。
    当记者一走进这个托儿所的篱笆院落，孩子们的歌声随风传来，所长张淑云在明亮而温暖的儿童游戏室里接待了记者。在这个朴素洁净的房间里，墙壁上挂着区人民委员会等单位赠送的许多奖状和锦旗，刚刚唱完了歌的孩子们正围坐在小桌旁等候着吃午后点心。游戏室的里间是儿童休息室，供给孩子们午睡的两排床上，铺着清洁的浅蓝色床单，花棉被整齐地叠在一端。这番情景，使人很难相信目前这个有着三十五个孩子的儿童乐园，它的前身竟是一家货栈不要了的破草棚。
    这个1952年组织起来的托儿所，是天津市群众自己兴办的最早的托儿所之一。那时，昆纬路一带还没有托儿所，许多夫妇都在工作的孩子无人照管。一些热心的家庭妇女为了解决这些孩子们父母的困难，就开始筹办一个小型托儿所。当公安局派出所刚帮助她们找到一间破草棚子和两条草帘子，邻居们借给她们一些床板和家具后，她们即时接收了八个孩子。这些家庭妇女热心公益事业的精神立刻受到政府有关单位和社会人士的支持：市房产公司为她们修缮了房子；邻居中的建筑工人利用假日来义务地帮她们盖小孩浴室、厕所；住在附近的电工帮她们安电灯；木工们收半价工钱为孩子们制造滑梯、秋千等玩具。有的邻居还赠送或廉价卖给托儿所木料，借出房子给“小班”孩子作休息室等。
    得到有关部门和社会人士支持后，兴办人仍旧处处精打细算，十分注意勤俭节约。她们自愿在初期不要工资，利用空闲时间到瓦砾堆里捡破砖头作修补房子的材料。托儿所正式开办后，在她们的努力下，虽然每个孩子每月的保育费只有十一元五角，比一般的托儿所要低四、五元。但是孩子们每天都能吃到肉类或鸡蛋，还能吃一次水果和点心。张淑云说：由于大家勤俭节约，现在托儿所已有四百多元的储蓄，准备在今年再盖两间房子，多帮助一些母亲解决托儿问题。
    兴办这个托儿所的六位家庭妇女都只有小学二、三年级的文化水平，为了学习保育知识，她们坚持参加区卫生科举办的保育知识讲座学习，每隔一天还要上一次文化课。她们不会教孩子们做游戏，就在别的托儿所的孩子们去公园游戏时，跟着去学；不会唱歌，就到附近小学校音乐教室的窗下去听，或请小学生来教。
    家长们对保育员们艰苦的劳动，表示无限的感激和敬意。时常在假日来看望她们，或请她们到家中作客。当记者正要告别的时候，天津胶管厂女工杜凤兰来接她的女儿杜金茹回家。她指着这个红光满面的小姑娘对记者说：金茹在托儿所的将近一年里，从来没有生过病，长的比以前胖多了；也懂得许多事。阿姨对孩子们可好呢！
