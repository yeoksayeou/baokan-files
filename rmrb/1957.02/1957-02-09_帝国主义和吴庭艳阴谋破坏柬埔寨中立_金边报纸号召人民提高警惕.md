Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 7th: The Cambodian-language "People's Daily" has recently published a series of editorials exposing the activities of imperialism in undermining Cambodia's peaceful and neutral line, and calling on the people to raise their vigilance.

    The "People's Daily" of February 1 stated: Less than half a month after the National Congress of the People's Socialist Community clarified Cambodia's peaceful and neutral line, Ngo Dinh Diem's troops once again invaded the border of Cambodia's Svay Rieng province.

    The newspaper continued, Ngo Dinh Diem's troops have repeatedly invaded Cambodian territory. The Cambodian people immediately understand that this is an act of aggression by foreign imperialism to hinder Cambodia's tendency toward peace and neutrality.

    The Cambodian-language "Tach Sang Newspaper" also published an editorial exposing the malicious rumors about Cambodia's neutrality circulating recently in Thailand and the fact that South Vietnamese troops have repeatedly invaded Cambodian territory.

    帝国主义和吴庭艳阴谋破坏柬埔寨中立
    金边报纸号召人民提高警惕
    据新华社金边7日电　柬埔寨文“人民报”最近连续发表社论，揭露帝国主义破坏柬埔寨和平中立路线的活动，并且号召人民提高警惕。
    2月1日的“人民报”说：人民社会同盟全国大会阐明柬埔寨的和平中立路线还不到半个月，吴庭艳的军队再度侵犯柬埔寨柴桢省的边境。
    这家报纸接着说，吴庭艳军队已经多次侵犯柬埔寨的领土。柬埔寨人民立刻明白这是外国帝国主义的侵略行动，以阻挠柬埔寨的和平中立的趋向。
    柬埔寨文“塔山报”也发表社论揭露最近在泰国流传着一些对柬埔寨的中立别有用心的谣言和南越军队多次侵犯柬埔寨国境的事实。
