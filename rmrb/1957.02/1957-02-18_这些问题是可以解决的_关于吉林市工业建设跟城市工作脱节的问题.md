These Problems Can Be Solved
——On the Disconnection Between Industrial Construction and Urban Work in Jilin City
By our reporter Chen Ji

Jilin City is located in the middle of Northeast China, with well-developed water and land transportation, rich mineral resources and agricultural products in the surrounding areas, and an inexhaustible supply of good quality Songhua River water. The Fengman Hydropower Station nearby provides ample and cheap electricity. These are all excellent conditions for developing industry.

In the past three years, Jilin City has undergone tremendous changes. The modern factories newly built and expanded here, such as Jilin Fertilizer Plant, Jilin Voltage Plant, Jilin Thermal Power Plant, and Fengman Power Station, have completely changed the original appearance of Jilin City. The land area of the two newly built industrial zones alone (Jiangbei Industrial Zone and Hadawan Industrial Zone) is equal to 143% of the total land area of the old city. With the development of industry, the population has increased rapidly. In June 1956, the city's population reached more than 537,000, more than double that of 1949. In the next few years, some factories will be newly built and expanded. This industrial zone has grown so rapidly that some municipal construction, cultural and welfare facilities, commerce, and service industries are far behind the development of industry. The two major industrial zones (Jiangbei Industrial Zone and Hadawan Industrial Zone) were sparsely populated wildernesses in the past, far from the old city, with almost no shops, schools, cinemas, or other service industries. Many factories have been built in these two industrial zones, they are large, and construction has been rapid, resulting in a "more bones than flesh" disconnection phenomenon. Workers' housing in the industrial zone is very difficult to obtain. In the past few years, more than 280,000 square meters of new housing have been built, accounting for 26.29% of the city's original housing area. However, there is still a shortage of more than 120,000 square meters of housing. This year, thousands of workers' children cannot enroll in school, and some primary school students who have already enrolled have to walk a long way every day and cross eight railway tracks to get to school, which is very unsafe. The populous industrial zone has no public hospitals. There are too few shops in the industrial zone. The commercial employees in the entire Jiangbei Industrial Zone account for only 0.7% of the population (according to a survey by the commercial department: a new industrial zone cannot meet the needs without commercial employees accounting for 3.5% of the population). There are only 19 commodity supply points in the industrial zone with a population of more than 130,000. There are no retail stores or small vendors outside the factory gates. Buying a pack of cigarettes requires walking several miles. Bathing, hairdressing, eating, sewing clothes, and repairing things are all very difficult. To see a movie, you have to walk several kilometers, and it is often difficult to buy a ticket. There are too few banks, post offices, and bookstores. Remitting money, depositing money, buying stamps, and buying books and magazines are not easy. Taking the bus is also very crowded. Taking the bus is even more difficult during rush hours and on Sundays.

Solving these difficulties requires a certain amount of time, a lot of work, and a lot of materials and money. However, to solve these difficulties in today's environment of limited national financial and material resources, a positive spirit is also needed. This positive spirit is to make the most of all possible conditions, mobilize existing forces from all parties, and do the most with the least money.

Does Jilin City now have conditions and forces that can be utilized? Some comrades say: "Our Jilin City is too dilapidated, the original conditions were very poor, and the existing forces that can be used are minimal." This view is not entirely correct.

First, let's take urban transportation as an example. According to the survey, in addition to 39 buses in Jilin City, enterprises also have 27 cars that can be used as passenger cars. These enterprise-owned cars are only used to transport employees to and from work and are not used much at other times. Can we absorb this batch of vehicles to participate in urban transportation work? The city currently has 580 tricycles and 250 horse-drawn carriages. The utilization rate of these vehicles is not high. The utilization rate of tricycles is below 30%. Can we organize them to go to the industrial zone? In addition, making full use of commuter trains and Songhua River shipping is also a way out. Changing the working hours and holidays of employees in some factories that have already been put into production, staggering the time for taking the bus, can also reduce the difficulty of taking the bus. Unfortunately, these conditions that can be utilized have not been fully utilized.

Let's take commerce and service industries as examples. There are too few service industries and shops in the two major industrial zones; while the restaurants, barbershops, sewing shops, grocery stores, department stores, small vendors, and some repair industries in the old city are mostly concentrated on a few bustling streets, and sometimes business is not very good. Mobilizing and organizing these shops and industries to move to the industrial zone can not only increase business income but also meet the needs of the industrial zone. Isn't this a good way? In fact, now a small number of service industries and individual joint state-private stores have moved to the industrial zone, set up wooden houses, and put up cloth tents, and they are still doing business, and business is booming. These few shops and industries that have moved in are preparing to expand their businesses and build new houses because their income has increased sharply. The current difficulties are not entirely due to inconvenient transportation and lack of housing, but to weak organizational leadership. As long as we seriously strengthen leadership and do more specific organizational work, it is not impossible to move the existing shops and industries in the city to the industrial zone.

Everyone is saying: There are too few state-owned commercial employees in the industrial zone, and they are too busy. However, there are many personnel in the upper-level organizations of the city's commercial departments, and there is overstaffing. According to the statistics of the 15 companies under the Jilin City Commercial Bureau, salespersons account for only 28.23% of all commercial employees. Those who do not directly participate in business are squeezed above, why can't they be decentralized? In addition, there are about 318 traditional Chinese medicine doctors in the city, can organizing them to support the industrial zone also reduce the difficulty of seeing a doctor? Mobilizing the city's Peking Opera troupes, Ping Opera troupes, and drama troupes to perform in the industrial zone regularly can also enliven the cultural life of the workers.

There is still a lot of potential in Jilin City. As long as we are good at using these forces and spend less money, we can also solve some of the difficulties of "more bones than flesh."

Building a city should be done slowly, not too quickly, and we should not talk about ostentation in everything.

Now some people are making plans all day long, wanting to build a series of comprehensive hospitals, comprehensive cultural centers, comprehensive cultural palaces, comprehensive shopping malls, and office buildings in the industrial zone. These plans are all needed. The question is whether they can be built quickly at the same time? Is there this huge investment? If they cannot be built for a while, how should we concentrate our efforts to solve some urgent problems? Building a new primary school in the Jiangbei Industrial Zone is an urgent problem. Last year, the state allocated 80,000 yuan to build a new primary school. However, because people planned to build a larger primary school, they asked the Ministry of Chemical Industry for another 60,000 yuan. The Ministry of Chemical Industry took the money. However, there was not enough time, the supply of materials and the construction force were insufficient, and it could not be built quickly. As a result, this primary school has not been built yet. Why didn't we build a part of it first when we had 80,000 yuan in the beginning? Why do we have to build a large-scale one all at once?

In construction, we must act according to our capabilities. If we want to do everything and want to do it on a large scale, we will inevitably encounter setbacks. However, we cannot blindly save money on construction related to the long-term plan. Saving a few dollars today will turn into a waste in the future. There has been such an example in Jilin City. The Jiangbei Bridge in Jilin City is a highway bridge with a length of 489 meters. It crosses the Songhua River and is the only link between the urban area and the Jiangbei Industrial Zone. The original design width of the bridge was 18.5 meters, which could simultaneously accommodate cars, trams, and sidewalks. Later, in order to save money, the design was revised, and the width of the bridge was reduced by 5 meters. Now that the bridge has been built, it can only accommodate cars. Now if you want to widen the bridge, it is not possible. Such savings lack foresight.

The savings we advocate refer to making full use of existing conditions, not doing things that cannot be done now, not doing everything in a complete set, and not dispersing manpower and material resources. Now the cultural and welfare facilities in the two major industrial zones in Jilin City are very lacking, but various factories have built many duplicate health centers, bathrooms, nurseries, kindergartens, and clubs because of the scattered use of investment. The two newly built factories in the Hadawan Industrial Zone are closely adjacent and belong to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. They could have jointly built some cultural and welfare facilities. Now these two factories each have their own set. For example, the residential areas of these two factories are close together, but they each built a well-equipped health center, and only a few dozen people see a doctor every day. In the old city, a well-equipped health center like this can see 400-500 patients every day. If these two factories jointly used the investment, they could at least build a public hospital with beds and outpatient departments to meet the needs of workers for seeing doctors and being hospitalized. The Jilin City Health Bureau once wanted to merge the health centers of these two factories into one to meet the needs of the public. This good method has not been implemented to this day due to the prevalence of departmentalism.

Although there are many factories in the two major industrial zones, they are not far apart. The residential areas of the factories are mostly connected together. These factories originally had the possibility of concentrating investment to organize various cultural welfare and health undertakings. Why do they each have their own set now? Because these factories belong to different central departments. Some of them belong to the same central industrial department, but they do not belong to the same administration. These central departments do not contact each other. After receiving the national investment, they distribute the investment to each factory according to the needs of each factory, and hand it over to each factory to independently organize all cultural and welfare undertakings, without considering the issue of cooperation at all. Although the Jilin City People's Committee wanted to intervene in the issue of these investments, it could not intervene, because the factories are directly under the central ministries, and they all have their own departmentalism. To concentrate the use of investment, no one is willing. The two adjacent newly built factories in the Hadawan Industrial Zone each built a set of power supply iron tower lines. This kind of duplication wastes national investment. Today everyone is saying: There are too few public cultural and welfare facilities. But everyone is still dispersing the use of funds and doing their own thing. This unreasonable phenomenon should not continue. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, the Jilin City People's Committee has put forward two methods, requesting the relevant central departments to consider. One method is that the central industrial ministries allocate investment to the factories, and the factories jointly organize various cultural and welfare undertakings, while the local people's committee is uniformly responsible for management. The other method is that the central government uniformly invests and hands it over to the local government, and the local government uniformly builds and manages it. No matter which method is adopted, in short, it is necessary to avoid the waste of scattered investment and doing everything in one's own way.

The problem of the disconnection between industrial construction and urban work in Jilin City can be gradually solved if we adhere to the spirit of thrift, make full use of the city's existing potential, use investment rationally, and do not advance on all fronts at the same time.

    这些问题是可以解决的
    ——关于吉林市工业建设跟城市工作脱节的问题
    本报记者　陈迹
    吉林市位于东北的中部，水陆交通发达，周围有丰富的矿藏和农产品，又有取之不尽的水质良好的松花江水。附近有丰满水电站提供给充裕廉价的电力。这些都是发展工业的优越条件。
    三年来，吉林市的变化是巨大的。在这里新建和扩建的吉林肥料厂、吉林电压厂、吉林热电厂和丰满发电站等现代化大工厂，已经完全改变了吉林市原来的面貌。光是新建设的两个工业区的土地面积，就等于老市区全部土地面积的143％。随着工业的发展，人口飞跃增加。1956年6月全市人口达到五十三万七千多人，比1949年增加一倍多。今后几年，还要新建和扩建一些工厂。这个工业区成长得如此迅速，以致一些市政建设、文化福利设施、商业和服务性行业，都远远落后在工业发展的后面。两大工业区（江北工业区和哈达湾工业区），过去都是人烟稀少的旷野，距离老市区很远，几乎没有什么商店、学校、电影院和其他服务性行业。在这两个工业区新建的工厂很多，很大，又很快，因而出现了一种“骨多肉少”的脱节现象。工业区的职工住宅，十分困难。几年来新建住宅二十八万多平方公尺，占全市原有住宅面积26.29％。但是，还缺少十二万多平方公尺的住宅。今年成千的职工子弟入不了学，有些已经入学的小学生，每天要走很远的路，还要跨过八条铁道，才到学校，很不安全。人口众多的工业区，没有公共的医院。工业区的商店过少，整个江北工业区只有占人口0.7％的商业从业人员（根据商业部门的调查：一个新工业区没有占人口3.5％的商业从业人员，不能满足需要）。十三万多人口的工业区，只有十九个商品供应点。工厂门外，没有零售店和小商小贩。买一包纸烟，要走几里地。洗澡、理发、吃饭、缝衣服、修补东西，都很困难。看电影，要走几公里地，常常买不着票。银行、邮局、书店都太少。汇款，存款，买邮票，买书报杂志，都不大容易。乘车又很拥挤。每逢上下班和星期天，乘车更困难。
    解决这些困难，需要一定的时间，需要做许多工作，也需要很多物资和钱。可是，要在国家财力物力有限的今天，解决这些困难，还需要有一种积极的精神。这种积极的精神，就是要尽量利用一切可能利用的条件，动员各方面现有的力量，用最少的钱办最多的事情。
    现在吉林市有没有可以利用的条件和力量呢？有些同志说：“我们吉林市太破旧，原来的条件就很差，能够利用的现有力量微乎其微。”这种看法是不完全正确的。
    先以城市交通工具为例。据调查，吉林市除了三十九辆公共汽车而外，各企业还有二十七辆能作为客车的汽车。这些企业自有的汽车，只接送上下班职工，平时使用得不多。能不能吸取这批车辆参加城市交通工作呢？全市现有五百八十辆三轮车和二百五十辆马车。这些车子使用率都不高。三轮车的使用率在30％以下。能不能组织它们到工业区去呢？此外，充分利用通勤火车和松花江航运，也是个出路。改变一些已经投入生产的工厂职工上下班时间和星期假日，错开乘车的时间，也能减少乘车的困难。可惜的是，这些可以利用的条件，还未被充分利用起来。
    再以商业、服务性行业等为例。两大工业区服务性行业和商店都过少；而老市区的饭馆、理发店、缝衣铺、杂货店、百货商店、小摊贩和一些修补行业大半集中在几条热闹的街道上，有时候生意不太好。动员和组织这些店铺和行业迁往工业区，既能增加营业收入，又能满足工业区的需要。这不是很好的办法吗？事实上，现在已经有少数服务性行业和个别公私合营商店，迁到工业区去了，搭起木板房，支起布帐篷，照样营业，生意兴隆。这些少数迁来的店铺行业因为收入骤增，都准备扩充业务，新修房屋。现在的困难倒不完全在于交通不便、房子缺少，而在于组织领导无力。只要认真加强领导，多做些具体组织工作，迁移市内现有的店铺行业到工业区去，不是办不到的。
    大家都在说：工业区的国营商业从业人员少，忙不过来。可是，全市商业部门上层机构人员却很多，人浮于事。根据吉林市商业局所属的十五个公司的统计，营业员只占全部商业职工28.23％。那些不直接参加营业的人员，都挤在上面，为什么不能下放呢？此外，市内约有三百一十八名中医，组织他们支援工业区，不也可以减少看病的困难吗？动员市内的京剧团、评剧团、话剧团，经常到工业区演出，也能活跃职工的文化生活。
    吉林市现有的潜力，还有很多。只要善于利用这些力量，少花一些钱，也可以解决一部分“骨多肉少”的困难。
    建设一个城市，要慢慢来，不能搞得过快，也不能事事都讲排场。
    现在有些人整天在做计划，要在工业区新建一系列的综合医院、综合文化馆、综合文化宫、综合商场和机关大楼等等。这些计划，都是需要的。问题是能不能很快地同时建成呢？有没有这笔巨大投资呢？如果一时不能建成，又应该怎样集中力量解决些迫切的问题呢？在江北工业区新建小学校，是个迫切的问题。去年国家已拨出八万元来新建一所小学校。但是，由于人们计划想要盖个大一些的小学校，要求中央化学工业部另给六万元。化学工业部拿了钱。可是，时间来不及，材料供应和施工力量都不足，不能很快建成。这样一来，这所小学校至今还未建设。为什么当初有了八万元，不先盖一部分呢？何必要一下子搞个规模大的呢？
    搞建设，要量力而行。事事都想搞，又想搞得大，必然要碰钉子。但是，对于有关百年大计的建设，也不能盲目地省钱。今天省几个钱，将来会变成一种浪费。吉林市有过这样的例子。吉林市江北大桥是一座长达四百八十九公尺的公路大桥，它跨过松花江，是联结市区和江北工业区的唯一纽带。原来设计大桥的宽度是十八点五公尺，能够同时行驶汽车、电车，又有人行道。后来，为了节约，修改设计，把大桥宽度减掉五公尺。现在这座大桥修成了，只能走汽车。如今再想把大桥弄宽一些，却不行了。像这样的节约，是缺少远见的。
    我们主张的节约，指的是充分利用现有条件，不办现在办不到的事情，不要样样都搞成全套，也不要分散人力物力。现在吉林市两大工业区的文化福利设施都很欠缺，但是各个工厂因为分散使用投资，建设了许多重复的卫生院、浴室、托儿所、幼儿园和俱乐部。哈达湾工业区的两个新建成的工厂，紧紧相邻，同属于中央冶金工业部，本来可以共同搞一些文化福利设施。如今这两个工厂却各搞了一套。例如：这两个工厂的住宅区靠在一起，却各自建设了一座设备齐全的卫生院，每天去看病的人，不过几十人。而在老市区，像这样一座设备齐全的卫生院，每天却能看病人四、五百名。这两个工厂如果共同使用投资，至少可以建成一座有病床又有门诊部的公共医院，满足职工看病和住院的需要。吉林市卫生局曾经想把这两个工厂的卫生院合并成一家，来满足公共的需要。这个好办法，由于本位主义思想在作怪，至今不能实行。
    两大工业区虽然有很多工厂，但是相隔都不远。各工厂的住宅区，多半连接在一起。这些工厂本来有可能集中使用投资，举办种种文化福利和卫生事业。现在为什么要各搞一套呢？因为这些工厂分属于不同的中央主管部门。有的虽然同属于一个中央工业部门，但是不同属于一个管理局。这些中央主管部门，互不联系，拿到国家投资以后，就按照各厂的需要，把投资分下来，交给各厂独自举办一切文化福利事业，根本没有考虑合作的问题。吉林市人民委员会虽然想要过问这些投资的问题，但是也过问不了，因为各厂都直属中央各部，又都各有本位主义思想。要集中使用投资，谁也不肯。哈达湾工业区两个相邻的新建成的工厂，各自建成一套供电的铁塔线路。这种重复的现象，浪费了国家投资。今天大家都在说：公共的文化福利设施太少。可是大家还在分散使用资金，独搞一套。这种不合理的现象，不应该再继续下去了。吉林市人民委员会为了消除这种现象，提出两个办法，请求中央有关部门考虑。一个办法是由中央各工业部把投资分给各厂，各厂合办种种文化福利事业，而地方人民委员会统一负责管理。另一个办法是中央统一投资交给地方，由地方统一建设、统一管理。不管采用何种办法，总之要避免分散投资、各搞一套的浪费现象。
    吉林市工业建设和城市工作脱节的问题，如果本着节约的精神，尽量利用城市现有的潜力，合理使用投资，不要齐头并进，是可以逐渐解决的。
