    Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, February 17th: West German Chancellor Adenauer stated on the 15th that he is willing to conclude a trade agreement with the Soviet Union.

    At a luncheon of the Foreign Correspondents Association, he said: The West German government is willing to consider the suggestions made by Bulganin in his letter to him regarding the expansion of trade between the two countries. Adenauer said: A trade agreement is different from a treaty of commerce and amity. He believes that the legal conditions for the two countries to conclude a treaty of friendship do not yet exist.

    Currently, trade between the Soviet Union and West Germany is conducted through agreements between the Soviet side and a committee composed of West German industrialists and businessmen, rather than through a formal agreement between the two governments.

    阿登纳表示
    愿同苏联订贸易协定
    新华社17日讯　波恩消息：西德总理阿登纳15日表示愿意同苏联缔结贸易协定。
    他在外国记者协会的午餐会上说：西德政府愿意考虑布尔加宁在给他的信里所提出的关于扩大两国贸易的建议。阿登纳说：贸易协定和通商友好条约是不同的。他认为两国缔结友好条约的法律条件还不存在。
    目前苏联和西德之间的贸易是通过西德工商业界人士所组成的委员会同苏联方面之间的协议来进行的，而不是通过两国政府之间的正式协定。
