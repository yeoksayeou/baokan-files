    The Correct Path, Great Victory
    —An Investigation of the October Agricultural Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei Province, After One Year of Production—
    The October Agricultural Production Cooperative of Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, is located in a hilly rice-producing area, close to the county seat, with convenient transportation, bordering a lake and backing onto mountains, with excellent natural conditions; however, the residents are relatively scattered, with all 316 households residing in 48 villages.

        Unprecedented Bumper Harvest

    In 1956, the October Agricultural Cooperative achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Compared with 1955, agriculture increased by 55.49%, diversified operations increased by 22.52%, the total annual income increased by 42.68%, and 98.08% of the agricultural and sideline production plan was completed. After ensuring the needs of expanded reproduction, the October Cooperative distributed a net income to its members that was, on average, 33.38% higher than in 1955, with the average living expenses per person increasing from 69 yuan in 1955 to 92 yuan. The increase in income benefited 90.5% of the total number of households. In the past, the total output value of agricultural increase never exceeded 20%. In the first year of operating as an advanced cooperative, on the basis of uneven organization and still relying on old plows and harrows, and on the basis of annual increases in production, the October Cooperative achieved an increase of 55.49% in one year, which is indeed very remarkable.
    Last year, the October Cooperative not only achieved overall increases in production, but also saw many miracles that people had never dreamed of. In agriculture, the yield of rice per mu had never exceeded 790 jin in previous years, but last year some mu yielded 1,635 jin; the yield of ginned cotton had never exceeded 81 jin in previous years, but last year some mu yielded 140 jin; the yield of rapeseed had never exceeded 150 jin in previous years, but last year some mu yielded 235 jin. These figures were all more than 80% higher than the average yield of similar crops in the bumper harvest of last year. In diversified operations, there were lotus roots yielding 4,000 jin per mu, fish yielding 800 jin per mu... These are all 100%-400% higher than the current average yield, showing even greater production potential than agriculture.
    From these facts, the members clearly recognized that the advanced cooperative was superior to the elementary cooperative. Lao Shangzhongnong (old upper-middle peasant) Zhan Yuesheng recalled his initial view of the advanced cooperative, saying, "At first, they said the advanced cooperative was superior in this and that, with rice yields of 1,000 jin, who would believe it; now it has really been achieved. In another year, I really don't know how many jin will appear!" This is the evaluation of the future of the advanced cooperative by farmers of all strata.

        Arduous Struggle

    The increase in production of the October Cooperative was not due to so-called "good years," but was achieved through a year of hard work.
    As soon as the cooperative was established, the cooperative cadres mobilized the members to formulate a 12-year long-term plan and a specific plan for agricultural and sideline production in 1956. After the plan was generated from the masses, "1,000 jin of rice, 100 jin of ginned cotton, one pig per household..." became the targets for mobilizing all positive forces within the cooperative. Over the past year, more than 4,500 workdays have been invested in building water conservancy projects, ensuring that 70.7% of the cultivated land is not afraid of drought for 60 days; the "Jiaohu" lake, which had not dried up for a hundred years, was pumped dry, and 380,000 dan of lake mud were collected in one winter. In order to ensure an increase in fertilizer demand, a fertilizer collection team was also established, and more than 120 cowsheds, pigsties, toilets, manure pits, and lime houses were built. Fertilizer accumulation increased by 68% compared to 1955. For the convenience of transporting lake mud, a road more than two li long was built overnight, which surprised everyone who went there the next morning. In order to expand diversified operations, four kilns were also expanded, a pigsty capable of raising 100 sows was built, and a waterproof embankment was built for 13.5 mu of lake surface. According to the survey, in order to fully realize the plan, the members participated in collective labor for the whole year, with male full laborers working 307 days, semi-laborers 261 days, female full laborers 171 days, and semi-laborers 152 days. Many night shifts are not included.
    The cooperative's plan also promoted the creativity and wisdom of the vast number of members. Cai Zhihe, the captain of the aquaculture team, suggested building a dike on the 13.5 mu of barren lake to plant lotus roots, which has now yielded a high-yielding lotus root of more than 2,000 jin per mu. Guo Shaoqiu, who raises fish, studied the method of artificial "incubation" of carp, and "incubated" 195,000 fish fry last year, adding 1,500 yuan to the cooperative's income. Shen Ligong of the kiln team and the members studied the "cold fire first, then rapid fire" kiln firing method, which shortened the time for firing each kiln by one day and saved 5 yuan of investment and 5 workdays. Guo Chunliu, the director of the Third Cooperative, and Zhan Yuesheng, the cotton ginning technician, studied using power to drive four cotton ginning machines. The members of the Seventh Team created a "twig seedling" method for sugarcane, ensuring that sugarcane was planted in a timely manner, with full seedlings, and achieved a bumper harvest. These are not only important reasons for the bumper harvest last year, but also created more favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of production in the future.
    The October Cooperative not only mobilized the members when formulating the plan, but also continuously checked the implementation of the plan in the production process, mobilized the members to modify and supplement the plan, so that the plan became more complete, advanced and reliable with the continuous improvement of production practice and member awareness. When the cooperative first formulated the plan, it underestimated the superiority of the advanced cooperative, and set the rice yield per mu at 750 jin, and the diversified operation plan was also very small. Later, by summarizing typical high-yield experience, checking loopholes, and analyzing the superior conditions brought about by the advanced cooperative, the yield of rice per mu was set at 1,003 jin, and the kiln burning plan was expanded, the duck raising plan was added, and concrete measures were taken for pig raising.

        Bold Innovation

    The 1956 production plan of the October Cooperative was based on production reform. They actively responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee for "bold innovation" and the "five reforms" in agriculture, and carried out comprehensive reforms in light of local conditions. In agriculture, the cooperative changed indica rice to japonica rice, accounting for 91.63% of the rice area, single-season to double-season, accounting for 30% of the paddy field area, of which double-season rice, early, late, and medium-late continuous cropping accounted for 19.66% of the paddy field area, and low-yield to high-yield (taro, peanuts, sugarcane) accounted for 10.07% of the cultivated land area. In diversified operations, barren lakes were changed into fish and lotus root lakes, fish and lotus roots were changed into intercropping, small fish fry were changed into large fish fry, self-grown fish were changed into artificial breeding, single cropping was changed into new and old fish continuous cropping, and the irrigation system for vegetables was reformed. These reforms encouraged the members to work selflessly and actively study technology. In addition to accumulating more fertilizer and building more ponds, the members also carried out a series of technical reforms in crop cultivation. Such as rice salt water seed selection, formalin disinfection, triangular close planting, ammonium sulfate application, as well as three times of insect removal and topdressing; cotton early sowing, strip planting and close planting, wheat field insect removal, topdressing, weeding, sugarcane "twig seedling," etc., are all things that have not been done in the technical reforms promoted in recent years. The members said, "Our rice! It is 'eight pulls and eight sowings' (double-season rice continuous cropping to seize the season, both seasons have to twig seedlings, pull four times before and after, and sow four times), sugarcane is 'double planting and double harvest' (because the seedlings planted once in the drought will die, and another one is planted in the rows to prevent loss)." This shows the arduousness of the technical reform work and the happy mood of the members. Thanks to the courageous reforms, a huge increase in production was achieved. For example, indica rice only increased by 4.3% compared to 1955, while japonica rice (late japonica) increased by 59.33% compared to indica rice in 1955; using one season of late japonica rice to replace "Huangmaonian" continuous cropping, the yield of double-season rice increased by 196.2% compared to 1955; sugarcane changed to Guang sugarcane and Taiwan sugarcane, and the yield increased by 116.5% compared to 1955; the yield of Daizi cotton increased by 41.9% compared to local cotton in 1955; the yield of Shengli rapeseed increased by 36% compared to local rapeseed in 1955. In short, whatever is reformed will increase production more.

        Careful Arrangement

    Experience proves that to achieve an advanced production plan, there must be a careful labor plan. Initially, the cooperative did not make a labor plan, and was too busy to handle agriculture alone. According to the survey, expanding winter sowing and replanting area, technical reform, increasing fertilizer accumulation and intensive cultivation alone required 39,845 more workdays than in 1955, accounting for 45.28% of the total number of workdays in 1955. If calculated based on 307 days of attendance per male full laborer in the cooperative last year, 129 more laborers would be needed. The labor shortage was obvious. When the cooperative checked the implementation of the plan in March, it found that early japonica rice headed early, vegetable sales were not good, the kiln industry was stopped, pig and duck raising were not started, and the plan was in danger of "falling through." Therefore, the cooperative management committee quickly mobilized the members to formulate a labor plan, and on the basis of obeying the needs of agricultural production, fully tapped the potential of labor based on the busy and slack seasons of agricultural and sideline production, needs, people's specialties, and the favorable conditions of using division of labor and division of industry, as well as the arrangements for difficult households and weak laborers. According to the plan, the male and female labor force needed for agriculture was first determined, and then the labor force engaged in diversified operations was drawn out, and the weak labor force and difficult households were focused on. In April, when agricultural work was tense, people were drawn back from sideline industries to carry out agricultural work in a concentrated way; in June, when it was relatively idle, more people were drawn out to carry out sideline industries such as printing bricks and transportation in a concentrated way. In this way, the comprehensive development of agricultural and sideline production was guaranteed.

          Democratic Cooperative Management

    The October Cooperative's guarantee of the basic realization of the plan should be attributed to the cooperative cadres' implementation of the democratic cooperative management policy. Over the past year, major issues such as the cooperative's production plan, production reform, infrastructure construction, and financial expenditure have been discussed and approved by the members' representative assembly before being implemented. Even general smaller issues have to be discussed by the standing committee of the cooperative management committee or the members. The big and small affairs of the cooperative are rarely decided by one person.
    In implementing the policy of democratic cooperative management, the cooperative did not simply do whatever the masses said, or listen to the masses in everything, but guided the members to move forward in the continuous struggle against conservative ideas. They fought against conservative ideas through technical lectures, organizing visits, and cadres going deep into various teams to help solve problems concretely, rather than forcing members to accept opinions. Therefore, it is often heard from the members: "In our cooperative, wherever there are difficulties, there are cadres."
    The October Cooperative also paid great attention to rewarding advanced workers and cultivating talents. The cooperative not only helped innovative new people overcome difficulties in the creative process, but also gave them spiritual and material rewards. The fish farming team that created carp incubation was awarded 250 yuan, of which Guo Shaoqiu alone received a bonus of 80 yuan. Model awards are generally held once a season. The rational award system further promoted the development of the advanced producer movement.

    正确的道路，巨大的胜利
    ——湖北浠水县十月农业社一年生产情况的调查——
    湖北省浠水县望城乡十月农业生产合作社，处在丘陵稻产区，临近县城，交通便利，滨湖靠山，自然条件很好；只是居住比较分散，全社三百一十六户，分住在四十八个湾子里。
        空前丰收
    1956年，十月农业社获得了空前的大丰收。同1955年比，农业增加55.49％，多种经营增加22.52％，全年总收入增加42.68％，完成了农、副业规划的98.08％。十月社除保证扩大再生产的需要以外，分给社员的纯收入，平均比1955年增加33.38％，每人平均生活费用由1955年的六十九元提高到九十二元。增加收入的面，达到总户数的90.5％。在这里，过去农业增产的总产值从没有超过20％，十月社在办高级社的第一年，在组织起来的基础不平衡和仍然依靠旧犁旧耙的情况下，并且在逐年增产的基础上，获得一年增产55.49％的成绩，这的确是很不容易的。
    十月社去年不仅全面增产，而且出现了很多为人们梦想不到的奇迹。在农业上，往年稻谷亩产没有突破过七百九十斤，去年有的亩产一千六百三十五斤；往年皮棉没有突破过八十一斤，去年有的亩产一百四十斤；往年油菜没有突破过一百五十斤，去年有的亩产二百三十五斤。这些数字，都比去年丰收的同类作物的平均产量高出80％以上。在多种经营上，有亩产四千斤的藕，亩产八百斤的鱼……。这些，都比目前的平均产量高出100％—400％，显示出比农业蕴藏着更大的生产潜力。
    社员从这些事实中，清楚地认识到高级社比初级社更加优越。老上中农占约生回忆当初自己对高级社的看法的时候说：“开始说高级社这优越，那优越，稻谷千斤，鬼相信；现在真正实现了。再过一年，真不晓得要出现几多斤！”这就是各阶层农民对高级社前途的评价。
        艰苦奋斗
    十月社的增产，并不是因为所谓“年岁好”，而是经过一年的艰苦努力得来的。
    社一建起来，社干部就发动社员制定十二年的远景规划和1956年农、副业生产的具体规划。当规划从群众中产生以后，稻谷千斤、皮棉百斤、一户一头猪……就成了动员社内一切积极力量的指标。一年来，投入四千五百多个劳动日兴修的水利，保证了70.7％的耕地六十天不怕天旱；车干了百年未干的“姣湖”，一个冬天抢积了三十八万担湖泥。为了保证需肥量的增加，还成立了积肥队，修建了牛栏、猪圈、厕所、粪窖、石灰屋等共一百二十多个。积肥比1955年增加了68％。为了运湖泥的方便，一夜修起了长达二里多的大路，使第二天早上重往那里的人们无不感到惊奇。为了扩大多种经营，还扩建了四个窑，增建了一栋能养百头母猪的猪舍和给十三亩半的湖面修筑了一道防水堤。据调查，社员们为了全面地实现规划，全年参加集体劳动的工作日，男全劳动力是三百零七天，半劳动力是二百六十一天，女全劳动力是一百七十一天，半劳动力一百五十二天。许多夜工还不计算在内。
    这个社的规划，还促进广大社员发挥了创造性和智慧。水产队长蔡之和建议把十三亩半的荒湖筑堤植藕，现已收亩产二千余斤的丰产藕。养鱼的郭少秋，研究了人工“孵化”鲤鱼的办法，去年“孵化”了十九万五千尾，给社里增加了一千五百元的收入。窑业队的申立功和社员一起研究了“先冷火，后急火”的烧窑办法，使每烧一个窑缩短一天时间，节约五元钱的投资和五个劳动日。第三社主任郭春六和轧花技术员占约生研究用动力带四部轧花机。第七队的社员创造了甘蔗“掇苗”办法，保证甘蔗种得适时、全苗，得到丰收。这些，不仅是去年得到大丰收的重要原因，而且给今后全面发展生产创造了更有利的条件。
    十月社不仅在制订规划的时候发动了社员，而且在生产过程中不断地检查规划的执行情况，发动社员修改和补充规划，使规划随着生产实践和社员觉悟的不断提高而更加完整和先进可靠。社里开始订规划的时候，对高级社的优越性估计不足，把稻谷单产订到七百五十斤，多种经营规划也很小。后来通过总结典型丰产经验、查漏洞、分析高级社所带来的优越条件，才把稻谷每亩产量订为一千零三斤，并扩大了烧窑计划，补订了养鸭计划，对养猪也采取了具体措施。
        大胆革新
    十月社1956年的生产规划，是订在生产改革的基础上的。他们积极地响应了省委提出的“大胆革新”和关于农业上“五项改革”的号召，因地制宜地进行了全面的改革。农业上，社里籼稻改粳稻占水稻面积的91.63％，单季改双季占水田面积的30％，其中双季稻、早、晚、中晚连作占水田面积的19.66％，低产改高产（芋头、花生、甘蔗）占耕地面积的10.07％。在多种经营上，改荒湖为鱼、藕湖，改鱼、藕为间作，改放小鱼种为放大鱼种，改自生鱼为人工饲养，改单作为新、陈鱼连作，以及蔬菜灌溉系统的改革等。这些改革，鼓舞社员忘我地劳动，积极地研究技术。社员们除多积肥，多修塘以外，对作物的栽培还进行了一系列的技术改革。像水稻的盐水选种、福尔马林消毒、三角密植、硫酸錏安蔸，以及三次除虫和追穗肥；棉花的提早播种、条播密植，麦地的除虫、追肥、锄草，甘蔗的“掇苗”等，都是几年来推行技术改革所没做过的。社员们说：“我们的稻谷呀！是‘八扯八播’（双季稻连作抢季节，两季都要掇苗，前后要扯四次，播四次），甘蔗是‘双种双收’（因天旱下的一次秧要死，在行间又下一次，以防损失）。”这说明技术改革工作的艰巨性和社员愉快的心情。由于勇敢地进行改革，获得了巨大的增产成绩。像籼稻比1955年只增加4.3％，而粳稻（晚粳）就比1955年的籼稻增产59.33％；运用一季晚粳代替“黄毛粘”连作，使二季稻的产量比1955年提高196.2％；甘蔗改用了广蔗、台蔗，产量就比1955年提高116.5％；岱字棉产量比1955年本地棉提高41.9％；胜利油菜比1955年本地油菜提高36％。总之，什么改革了，什么就增产多。
        周密安排
    经验证明，要实现先进的生产规划，必须有周密的劳动规划。最初，社里没作劳力规划，光忙农业也忙不过来。据调查，光扩大冬播和复种面积，技术改革、增积肥料和精耕细作等项，就比1955年要多用三万九千八百四十五个工，占1955年全年用工总数的45.28％。若以全社去年每个男全劳动力出勤三百零七天计算，就多需要一百二十九个劳动力。劳力紧张的情况是很显然的。社里在3月间检查执行规划情况的时候，发现早粳早出穗，蔬菜销路不大，窑业停了，养猪、养鸭没搞起来，规划大有“落空”的危险。于是，社管理委员会赶快发动社员制订劳动规划，在服从农业生产需要的基础上，根据农、副业生产的闲忙季节、需要、人的特长以及利用分工分业的有利条件和对困难户及弱劳动力的安排等，充分地挖掘劳动力的潜力。根据规划，社里把农业所需要的男女劳力首先确定下来，然后抽出从事多种经营的劳力，又着重安排了劳力弱的和困难户。4月农活紧张，从副业抽人回来突击农业；6月较闲，就抽出更多的人去突击印砖、运输等副业。这样，就保证了农、副业生产得以全面开展。
          民主办社
    十月社保证了规划的基本实现，应当归功于社干部执行了民主办社方针。一年来，社里的生产规划、生产改革、基本建设、财务开支等重大问题，都是经过社员代表大会讨论通过作出决议，然后付诸实行的。就是一般较小的问题，也都要经过社管理委员会的常委或社员讨论。社里办的大、小事，很少是一个人作决定的。
    社里在贯彻执行民主办社的方针上，也并不是群众说什么就是什么，什么都听群众的，而是在不断地向保守思想作斗争当中引导社员前进。他们同保守思想斗争是通过技术讲座、组织参观和干部深入到各队、具体帮助解决问题等方法进行的，不是强制社员接受意见。因此，常常可以听到社员说：“我们社，哪里有困难，哪里就有干部。”
    十月社还十分注意奖励先进，培养人材。社里对有创造性的新人物，不仅帮助他们在创造过程中克服困难，而且给予了他们精神上物质上的奖励。创造鲤鱼孵化的养鱼组，就得奖二百五十元，其中郭少秋一人就得到八十元的奖金。评奖模范一般是一季举办一次。合理的评奖制度进一步地推动了先进生产者运动的开展。
