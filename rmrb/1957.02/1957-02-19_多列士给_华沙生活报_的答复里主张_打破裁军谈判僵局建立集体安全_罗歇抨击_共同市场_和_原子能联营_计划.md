Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: According to TASS, Warsaw, February 17th: Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, said in a reply to "Warsaw Life" that for European security, the deadlock in disarmament negotiations must be broken, and collective security must be established. He said that in the struggle to defend peace, the friendship, the increasing unity and cooperation among all socialist countries and all communist and workers' parties is a decisive factor.

Thorez's reply was published in the newspaper on the 17th. He said that the current period is characterized by the resumption of the Cold War and the reappearance of a certain danger of a third world conflict. The revival of German militarism is one of the factors intensifying international tensions. The governments of France, West Germany, Italy, and the Benelux countries are simultaneously trying to establish a "European Common Market" and a "European Atomic Energy Community," and are persuading their respective parliaments to approve these two organizations. Some people are striving to establish a "small Europe," characterized by West German dominance and subservience to American interests and American policies.

Thorez pointed out the important role played by Poland in the struggle to defend peace and European security. He said that the French people warmly hope that the economic and political strength of socialist Poland can continue to grow. The unity of the socialist camp strengthens the security of the people. Therefore, the Warsaw Pact is a powerful fortress for defending peace in Europe.

He said that in order for friendship and collective security to replace the arms race and bloc politics in Europe, it is first necessary to mobilize the strength of the masses. He hopes that the working people of France and Poland will continue to strengthen their solidarity and cooperation to promote the realization of this great cause to a greater extent.

Xinhua News Agency: Waldeck Rochet delivered a report on "'European Schemes' and the Struggle for National Independence and Peace" at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party on the 14th. He spoke about the plans to establish a "Common Market" and the "European Atomic Energy Community." He said that this plan threatens the existence of France as an independent nation and also threatens world peace.

The reporter cited specific materials to prove that the establishment of the "Common Market" will inevitably lead to West Germany's achievement of economic hegemony. He said that the "Common Market" planned by large monopoly capital is a means of struggle against the social achievements of the working people, and also a class weapon against the working masses. It poses a great threat to the social achievements of the French working class. It also threatens the interests of French small business owners and the people of French overseas territories.

Rochet believes that the purpose of establishing the "European Atomic Energy Community" is nothing more than to enable West Germany to manufacture atomic bombs.

Rochet emphasized that, under these circumstances, the task of the French Communist Party is to organize the struggle to defend France's national sovereignty. This struggle should be launched universally, and should be on the same scale as the previous struggle against the "European Defense Community" plan.

The plenary session adopted Rochet's report and called on party organizations at all levels to organize the masses to fight against the above-mentioned plans in the spirit of this report, and to fight for the implementation of a policy of national independence and a policy of social progress and peace.

    多列士给“华沙生活报”的答复里主张
    打破裁军谈判僵局建立集体安全
    罗歇抨击“共同市场”和“原子能联营”计划
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社华沙17日讯：法国共产党总书记多列士在给“华沙生活报”的答复里说，为了欧洲安全，必须打破裁军谈判中的僵局，必须建立集体安全。他说，在保卫和平的斗争中，一切社会主义国家以及一切共产党和工人党间的友谊、日益加强的团结和合作是一个决定性的因素。
    多列士的答复刊载在17日的报纸上。他说，目前这一时期的特点是冷战的恢复和第三次世界性冲突的某种危险的再次出现。德国军国主义的复活是国际紧张局势加剧的因素之一。法国、西德、意大利和比、荷、卢各国的政府同时正在尽力建立“欧洲共同市场”和“欧洲原子能联营组织”，并说服本国议会赞同这两个组织。一些人正在努力争取建立“小欧洲”，这个“小欧洲”的特点是西德的统治地位和对美国利益、对美国政策的屈从。
    多列士指出波兰在保卫和平和欧洲安全的斗争中所起的重要作用。他说，法国人民热烈地希望社会主义波兰的经济和政治力量能够不断增长。社会主义阵营国家的团结巩固了人民的安全。因此华沙条约是保卫欧洲和平的强大堡垒。
    他说，为了使友谊和集体安全能够在欧洲代替军备竞赛和集团政策，必须首先把人民群众的力量动员起来。他希望法国和波兰的劳动人民不断加强团结和合作，在更大程度上促进这个伟大事业的实现。
    据新华社讯　瓦德克·罗歇14日在法国共产党中央委员会全体会议上作了关于“‘欧洲方案’和争取民族独立和和平的斗争”的报告。他谈到关于建立“共同市场”和“欧洲原子能联营组织”计划问题。他说，这个计划威胁着作为独立国家的法国的存在，也威胁着世界和平。
    报告人举出了一些具体的材料，证明“共同市场”的建立，不可避免地会使西德取得经济霸权。他说，大垄断资本所谋划的“共同市场”是反对劳动人民社会成果的斗争手段，也是反对劳动群众的阶级武器。它对法国工人阶级的社会成果是一个很大的威胁。它也同样威胁到法国小企业主的利益和法国海外领地的人民。
    罗歇认为建立“欧洲原子能联营组织”的计划的目的无非是使西德能够制造原子弹。
    罗歇强调指出，在这种情况之下，法国共产党的任务是组织斗争来保卫法国的民族主权。这个斗争应该普遍展开，而且应该同以前反对“欧洲防务集团”计划的斗争具有同样规模。
    全体会议通过了罗歇的报告，并且号召各级党组织本着这个报告的精神，组织人民群众为反对上述方案而斗争，为实行民族独立政策、实施社会进步与和平政策而斗争。
