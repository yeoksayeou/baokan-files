From the Dadu River to the Jinsha River	By Our Correspondent Ji Xichen
        To Liangshan

    When you study ancient history and the history of social development, you may have read about the slave societies of ancient Greece, Rome, and China's Yin and Shang dynasties; in addition, you may have seen tools and utensils left over from ancient slave societies in the display rooms of some historical museums! However, when you study and appreciate these historical relics from two or three thousand years ago, do you know that in the Liangshan Yi ethnic region in southwestern Sichuan Province of our motherland, this primitive slave system and slave society still existed until 1956?!

    Liangshan, stretching from Xichang in the west to Leibo in the east, and from the Dadu River in the north to the Jinsha River in the south, covers an area of 35,000 square kilometers, dotted with undulating mountains, deep ravines, and barren plateaus. They average more than 2,000 meters above sea level, while Huangmaogang and Baicaopo reach more than 4,000 meters. Because of the high mountains and cold climate, it is called Liangshan (Cool Mountains). Huangmaogang, located east of Meigu County and extending 500 miles from north to south, is the natural boundary between Greater and Lesser Liangshan. The east side is Lesser Liangshan, and the west side is Greater Liangshan. After the national liberation, the policy of ethnic regional autonomy was implemented here. In April 1955, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region was changed to the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, and the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee was established. Now, the autonomous prefecture governs fourteen counties including Leibo, Zhaojue, Mabian, Ebian, Wagang, Jinyang, Butuo, Yuexi, Hongxi, Jialuo, Xide, Puxiong, Puge, and Meigu. The total population of the region is 970,000, of which more than 706,000 are Yi people, making it the largest gathering area of the 3.25 million Yi compatriots in the country.

    People will ask: In such a vast area, why did the primitive slave system persist for so long? How did the Yi people living in the slave system live and produce? And now, how are they, under the light of the Party's general line and the guidance of the Party's ethnic policies, gradually completing the leap across the era from slave society to socialist society through democratic reforms? How are the tens of thousands of liberated slaves now building a new life? Such questions are of concern and interest to many people.

    In order to understand these issues, I set off from Chengdu for Liangshan with excitement on November 11, 1956, with the Central慰问团.
       On the Sichuan-Yunnan Road

    That afternoon, our convoy passed through the vast Chengdu Plain and arrived at Ya'an on the bank of the Qingyi River. Although it was already winter, the mountains around Ya'an were still decorated with green lace. Its verdant mountains and clear rivers set off the neat city, making it particularly quiet and lovely. On this day, despite the torrential rain in Ya'an, people of all ethnic groups still flocked to the roadside in groups to warmly welcome the Central慰问团 sent by Chairman Mao.

    From Ya'an southwards, we traveled along the continuously sharp-turning Sichuan-Yunnan Road, winding our way through the Hengduan Mountains. After passing through the Siping Yingjing Iron Mine and climbing more than 30 kilometers from the foot of the mountain, we reached the summit of Niba Mountain. At this time, when I turned my head and looked down, I realized that the road we had just passed was like a spiral staircase, hanging almost vertically in front of the mountain. The Erlang Mountain in the west, the Xianggong Ridge in the east, and those unnamed dazzling blue mountains, rose and fell continuously above the swirling white clouds, extending infinitely to the distant horizon.

    Not far from the highway is an ancient post road. According to the Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han, more than 2,000 years ago, when Emperor Wu of Han heard that he could take a route through the southwest to India, he immediately appointed Sima Xiangru, a famous writer from Shu, as Zhonglang General, and mobilized tens of thousands of fathers and elders of Ba and Shu to carve out roads in the mountains in the areas of Hanyuan, Yuexi, and Xichang, to "appease and drive from afar," opening up the first road to the south. During the Three Kingdoms period, in the third year of Jianxing, Zhuge Liang personally led a large army to "cross the Lu River in May and penetrate the barren lands" (Note: According to the Xichang County Chronicle: the Lu River is today's Jinsha River. The Jinsha River is called the Lu River because of its deep blue water color), spending a year in these mountains, "seven times capturing and releasing" Meng Huo, a military leader of ethnic minorities, and stabilizing the southwest by political means. Historical sites such as the Wuhou Temple and Meng Huo City can still be seen along the highway. In 1252 AD, Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty also passed through here, leading his army across the Dadu River and the Jinsha River into Yunnan, conquering Dali, Annam, and other countries. From that time until the Ming and Qing dynasties and the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang, this historical ancient road has always been a passage for rulers to massacre and attack ethnic minorities in the southwest. In years of war, the villages and towns along the ancient road were burned down, the fields were barren, the people fled, and the hillsides were filled with the graves of the victims. However, now, these historical tragedies are gone forever.

    Look! Under the broken castle of the ancient Yuexi County, a motorcade with red flags waving, is speeding in the dust-filled air, fully loaded with rice, department stores, winter clothes, building materials, and various慰问品. And in the fields below the mountain, everywhere are cooperative members busy with winter farming and herds of livestock grazing by children. When they saw the motorcade approaching, everyone waved frequently, giving us pleasant smiles.

    Once we entered the Liusha River Valley of Hanyuan County, we felt as if we had arrived in the land of fruits. The green ash trees, dense oranges, tangerines, and pear trees, surrounded the villages in clusters. Under the warm sunshine, the branches full of red oranges and yellow tangerines, extended over the low courtyard walls, spreading an enticing fragrance to passers-by. Many travelers passing through this place, were busy filling their bags with fruit - pears cost eight cents a pound, and tangerines cost six cents a pound, which was surprisingly cheap! According to statistics from Hanyuan County government: the county's local products, fruit alone, yield more than 2.55 million catties.

    It is said that this is also the place described in "Journey to the West" where the Tang Monk passed through on his way back from obtaining the scriptures. Legend has it that when the Tang Monk passed by the Liusha River, because he was teased by a giant turtle in the river, he soaked the scriptures in the river water. The Sutra Drying Mountain across the river is where the Tang Monk dried the scriptures!
    Talking About the Past and Present by the Dadu River

    From Fulin (Hanyuan) westward, heading towards Shimian for about fifty kilometers, we continued to wind along the steep banks of the Dadu River, advancing in the canyons of cliffs and precipices. Following the white belt-like highway, the car sometimes climbed to the top of the mountain and sometimes descended to the beach by the river. Right next to us, the rushing waters of the Dadu River, surged with torrents, flashed with blue light, sprayed white waves, floated large amounts of wood, impacting and roaring, passing through the cliffs, and surging eastward.

    Ah, Dadu River! You are surging and surging, mighty and vast, galloping on the Sichuan-Kang plateau; you flow thousands of miles, incomparably strong, how many heroes and heroines have fought around you in history; your glorious name will always enlighten people with wisdom and strength!

    "Riding a horse across the cliff, bending a bow to shoot the Hu moon," a hundred years ago, Shi Dakai, the Yi King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, who once shook the world, led an army of more than 100,000, crossed the Jinsha River from Yunnan, passed through the Yi inhabited Greater Liangshan areas of Mianning and Yuexi, and arrived at the Zidaidi, Songlindi, and Anshunchang line on the south bank of the Dadu River on March 27th of the 2nd year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty. At that time, they encountered a flood surge, and could not rush across the river. In addition, Shi Dakai celebrated the birth of his son along the way, delaying the time for crossing the river and advancing, so he was quickly surrounded by Qing troops and Yi chieftains, who blocked and chased him. In the narrow mountainous area, although the heroes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fought hard for a whole month, they finally failed to cross the Dadu River due to policy and military command errors, and the entire army was wiped out. Regarding this historical tragedy, when we crossed the cable suspension bridge over the Dadu River in Shimian, we saw a detailed record in front of the "Yi King Pavilion" commemorating Shi Dakai. On the inscription "A True Record of the Difficulties of Shi Dakai, Yi King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, at Zidaidi," the bitter battle situation after Shi Dakai's several failed attempts to cross the river was described as follows: "...By then, both fighting and defense were exhausted, advance and retreat were impossible, food was exhausted and they ate grass roots, grass was exhausted and they ate war horses, and malaria was prevalent, causing death to pile up like pillows..." Even so, the steadfast Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army remained "unmoved." When the battle ended, in order not to become prisoners of the rulers, many old men, children, and women in the army, including Shi Dakai's children, wrapped themselves in white silk and threw themselves into the Dadu River. "Tens of thousands of subordinates drowned with each other," and the river was congested and discolored. On May 3, when Shi Dakai was captured and escorted from Fulin to Chengdu, more than 10,000 of his subordinates who remained were massacred by Qing troops at Dashubao. The reddish-brown land on the back mountain of Zidaidi is said to have been dyed red by the blood of the martyrs!

    "The warm clouds caress the rocks by the Jinsha River, the iron chains of the Dadu Bridge are cold," seventy years later, in the same place where Shi Dakai's army was wiped out, the heroic First Army Corps of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, under the strong leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, on May 9, 1935, forcibly crossed the Jinsha River on the border of Sichuan and Yunnan, passed through Huili, Dechang, Lugu, Mianning, Daqiao, Tuowu, Xiaopuzi and other places, marched eight hundred and fifty-five li, and arrived at Anshunchang on the banks of the Dadu River on May 25. This time, although the Red Army also encountered a flood surge, the rapids of the Dadu River could not stop the advance of the people's army. Seventeen heroes, led by Xiong Shanglin, the company commander of the Second Company, under the cover of the Red Army's machine gun fire, achieved a surprise attack across the river in front of the enemy from the crossing point of Shawan, quickly destroying the enemy's resistance and covering the main force to cross the natural barrier of the Dadu River. This unprecedented achievement will forever be recorded in the history of the Chinese revolutionary war.

    Recalling this glorious page of Chinese revolutionary history, an old soldier who personally participated in this historical miracle said excitedly to me: After the Red Army crossed the river, they immediately split into two routes along the north and south banks of the Dadu River, climbing the cliffs and precipices, and advancing day and night for four consecutive days. Above, enemy planes were strafing and bombing, and below, there were white waves of floods. Every time night fell, everyone lit thousands of torches, and the firelight reflected on the river, like a fire dragon swimming in the deep valley. At that time, everyone was extremely tired, but the belief that "advance is victory" encouraged people to advance, advance, and advance again! The Red Army finally seized the Luding Bridge on May 30, and began the march to cross the snow-capped mountains and grasslands.

    At that time, a popular "Red Army Enters Sichuan Song" sang:
    The dangerous Jinsha River and Dadu River,
    The wild Greater Liangshan and the Yi ethnic region,
    Our heroic Red Army is truly invincible
    We occupied the Luding Bridge and made great contributions,
    We created a new record in Chinese history,
    We achieved the meeting of the two major forces,
    Advance bravely, advance bravely!
    Eliminate the enemy, long live the revolution!

    Sixteen years have passed. The victorious Chinese people sent a part of the People's Army and came to the Dadu River again. After clearing the Kuomintang remnants, wind drills and hoes became the weapons in their hands, and they began to advance towards nature on the banks of the Dadu River where the Red Army had passed.

    Look, on that dusty hillside, the workers of the Sichuan Shimian Mine raised the red flag of labor competition. The roaring high-altitude cableway, sends glistening asbestos ore. Its pure white fibers, as fine as hair, can be woven into various asbestos products, which are used for insulation, acid resistance, alkali resistance, and high temperature resistance. They are indispensable and valuable materials in industrial production. According to historical records, in the time of Emperor Huan of the Later Han Dynasty, General Liang Ji's fairy clothes that could not be burned by fierce fire were woven from asbestos. This mine, since it was opened in 1918, has quickly won the praise of China and foreign countries for its products. A British "asbestos king" collected a piece of asbestos 108 centimeters long, and considered it a "rare treasure," but the longest asbestos here is 128 centimeters. The mineral deposits here are rich, and the ore beds extend for dozens of miles, with an annual output of more than 10,000 tons of asbestos, making it the largest asbestos mining area in China.

    With the continuous expansion of the Shimian Mine, the barren dam that had only six or seven thatched huts five years ago has now become a new industrial town with four or five thousand people. New brick houses and buildings stand on the banks of the Dadu River. (To be continued)

    从大渡河到金沙江	本报记者　纪希晨
        到凉山去
    当你学习古代史和社会发展史的时候，你曾经读到过关于古代希腊、罗马以及中国殷、商时代奴隶社会的记载；此外，你或许还在某个历史博物馆的陈列室里，看到过古代奴隶社会遗留下来的工具和器皿吧！可是，当你研究、鉴赏这些两三千年前的历史文物的时候，你是否知道：就在我们祖国的四川省西南的凉山彝族地区里，直到1956年以前，也还存在着这种原始的奴隶制度和奴隶社会呢？！
    凉山，西起西昌，东至雷波，北起大渡河，南至金沙江，在这纵横三万五千平方公里的面积上，到处都是起伏的山峦，深邃的沟壑和荒漠的高原，它们平均拔海两千多公尺，而黄茅岗、白草坡则高达四千多公尺。因为山高气寒，所以人们称它为凉山。位于美姑县东的、南北长达五百多里的黄茅岗，是大、小凉山的天然分界线，它的东面是小凉山，西面是大凉山。全国解放以后，这里推行了民族区域自治政策，1955年4月，根据宪法的规定，凉山彝族自治区改为彝族自治州，建立了凉山彝族自治州人民委员会。现在，自治州辖有雷波、昭觉、马边、峨边、瓦岗、金阳、布拖、越嶲、洪溪、呷洛、喜德、普雄、普格、美姑等十四个县。全区人口九十七万，其中彝族达七十万六千多，是全国三百二十五万彝族同胞中的一个最大聚居区了。
    人们会问：在这样一个广大的地区上，原始的奴隶制度，为什么会这样长期存在下来呢？生活在奴隶制度中的彝族同胞，是怎样生活、怎样生产的呢？而现在，他们又是怎样在党的总路线的灯塔照耀下，在党的民族政策的指导下，经过民主改革，逐步完成从奴隶社会到社会主义社会的跨越时代的飞跃呢？成千成万被解放了的奴隶，如今，又是怎样在建设新的生活呢？诸如这些问题，都是许多人所关心和感到兴趣的。
    为着了解这些问题，我怀着兴奋的心情，在1956年11月11日，随中央慰问团从成都向凉山进发了。
        川滇路上
    这天下午，我们的车队，穿过辽阔的川西平原，到达了青衣江畔的雅安。这时虽然已是冬天，可是雅安周围的群山却仍装饰着绿色的花边，它那苍翠的山峦和碧清的江流，把整齐的市区陪衬得特别清幽和可爱。这一天，尽管雅安下着滂沱大雨，可是，各族人民仍成群结队地涌向路边，热烈欢迎毛主席派来的中央慰问团。
    由雅安向南，我们一直沿着连续急转的川滇路，拐来拐去地穿行在横断山脉间。过了泗萍荥经铁矿从山脚爬了三十多公里，才上到泥巴山的顶巅。这时，我扭头俯视后面，方发现刚才经过的道路，好像一座螺旋形的楼梯，几乎垂直地悬挂在山的跟前。西边的二郎山，东边的相公岭，还有那些无名的蓝得耀眼的高山，连绵起伏地耸立在团团白云的上面，无极地延伸到辽远的天边。
    距公路不远有一条古代的驿道。根据史记、汉书记载，两千多年前，当汉武帝听到可以取道西南通向印度时，马上任命当时著名的文学家蜀人司马相如为中郎将，动员成千成万的巴蜀父老，在汉源、越嶲、西昌一带，凿山通道，“远抚长驾”，第一次开辟了南进的大道。三国时，建兴三年，诸葛亮又亲率大兵，“五月渡炉，深入不毛”（注：据西昌县志载：炉水即今日之金沙江。金沙江因水色深碧故称炉水），花了一年时间，在这带丛山里，“七擒七纵”少数民族军事首领孟获，用政治争取方法安定了西南。武侯祠、孟获城等古迹，至今公路沿线还时有所见。公元1252年，元忽必烈也曾经这里，率军渡过大渡河、金沙江进入云南，征服了大理、安南等国。从那时起一直到明、清王朝和国民党的反动政权，这条历史的古道，就一直是统治者屠杀、进攻西南少数民族的孔道。在连年的征战里，古道两旁的村镇焚毁了，田野荒芜了，人民逃亡了，山坡上堆满了被害者的丘坟。可是，现在，这些历史的悲剧，永远一去不返了。
    看吧！在那古老的越嶲郡的残破城堡下，红旗飘扬的车队，正满载着大米、百货、寒衣、建筑器材和各种慰问品，疾驰在蔽天的尘土里。而山下的田野间，到处都是忙着冬耕的合作社社员和孩子们牧放的牲畜群，潺潺的溪流边，妇女们在洗濯衣衫。当他们看到车队过来的时候，大家便频频招手，向我们报以愉快的微笑。
    一进入汉源县的流沙河谷，我们就仿佛到了水果之乡。那碧绿的白蜡树、茂密的橘子、广柑、梨子树，一团团地把村落簇拥着。温暖的阳光下，那些结满了红橘黄柑的枝干，伸过不高的院墙，向路人散放着诱人的清香。多少旅人经过这个地方，都忙把水果装满自己的行囊——梨子八分钱一斤，广柑六分钱一斤，真是便宜得惊人！据汉源县府统计：全县土产中仅水果就产二百五十五万多斤。
    这里，据传还是“西游记”描写的，唐僧取经归来经过的地方。传说：当唐僧路过流沙河时，因被河中巨龟所戏，曾把经书淹浸在河水里。河对面的晒经山，就是唐僧晒经的地方哩！
    大渡河边话今昔
    从富林（汉源）向西，往石棉走约五十多公里，我们一直傍着峻峭的大渡河岸，蜿蜒前进在悬崖峭壁的峡谷里。顺着白带似的公路，车子时而升到山顶，时而又下降到河边的滩坝上。就在我们身边，那湍急的大渡河水，涌卷着激流，闪着青光，喷着白浪，漂浮着大量的木料，冲击咆哮着，穿过岩崖，汹涌地奔向东方。
    呵，大渡河！你奔腾澎湃，浩浩荡荡，骋驰在川康高原之上；你一泄千里，无比坚强，历史上有多少英雄豪杰，转战在你的身旁；你的光辉的名字，永远向人们启示着智慧和力量！
    “策马渡悬崖，弯弓射胡月”，百年前，威震一时的太平天国翼王石达开，率兵十余万，由云南渡金沙江，经冕宁、越嶲等地彝族聚居的大凉山，在清同治2年3月27日，到达了大渡河南岸的紫大地、松林地和安顺场一线。当时正遇江洪暴涨，抢渡不得，加以途中石达开庆祝他儿子的诞生，延误了渡河进军的时间，所以很快就被清兵和彝族土司，前堵后追地团团包围起来。在狭窄的山岳地带里，太平天国的英雄们，虽然整整奋战了一个月，可是，终于由于政策和军事指挥上的错误，没有能够渡过大渡河，而全军复没了。对于这段历史的悲剧，我们从石棉渡过大渡河的钢索吊桥时，在纪念石达开的“翼王亭”前，曾看到一处详尽的记载。在写着“太平天国翼王石达开紫大地蒙难纪实”的碑记上，对于石达开几次强渡失败后的苦战情形，这样记述说“……至是战守俱穷，进退失据，粮尽食及草根，草尽食及战马，兼之疟疾流行，死亡枕籍……”即是这样，但坚贞不屈的太平天国军队，仍“屹然不动”。当战斗结束时，他们为了不作统治者的俘虏，许多从军的老人、孩子和妇女，包括石达开的儿女在内，都以白帛裹身，投身大渡河中。“部属相率溺者以万计”，河水为之拥塞和变色。5月3日，石达开被俘从富林解押成都时，他所留下的一万多部下，也全在大树堡遭到了清兵的屠杀。紫大地后山那一片赤褐的土地，相传就是殉难者的血迹染红的！
    “金沙水拍云岩暖，大渡桥横铁索寒”，七十多年后，就在石达开军队复没的地方，英雄的工农红军第一军团，在党和毛主席的坚强领导下，于1935年5月9日，强渡川滇边界的金沙江，经过会理、德昌、泸沽、冕宁、大桥、拖乌、小铺子等地，行军八百五十五里后，在5月25日，到达大渡河边的安顺场。这一次，红军虽然同样遇到暴涨的洪水，但是，大渡河的激流，没有能阻止住人民军队的前进。以二连连长熊上林为首的十七位英雄，在红军机枪火力掩护下，从渡河点沙湾，在敌前实现强渡奇袭，迅速摧毁了敌军的抵抗，掩护大军渡过了天险大渡河。这一史无前例的战绩，将永远记录在中国革命的战争史上。
    回忆起中国革命史这光辉的一页，一位曾经亲身参加过这幕历史奇迹的老战士，兴奋地对我说：红军渡河以后，立即分两路沿着大渡河南北两岸，攀登着悬崖绝壁，连续四天，日夜兼程向西疾进。上空是敌机的扫射轰炸，下面是白浪滔天的洪水。每当夜幕降临，大家就点燃起千万只火把，火光映照着河水，宛如一条火龙腾游在深谷里。那时大家虽然疲乏到了极点，可是，“前进就是胜利”的信念，鼓舞着人们前进，前进，再前进！红军终于在5月30日，抢占了泸定桥，开始了翻越雪山草地的进军。
    当时，流行的一首“红军入川歌”曾这样歌唱：
    天险的金沙江、大渡河，
    蛮荒的大凉山、彝族区，
    我英勇红军，真正无坚不摧
    占领了泸定桥，建大功，
    我们创造了中国历史新记录，
    我们取得了两大主力的会合，
    勇敢前进，勇敢前进！
    消灭敌人，革命万岁！
    时间又过了十六年。胜利了的中国人民派遣了一部分人民军队，又来到了大渡河边。他们在肃清国民党残匪之后，风钻洋镐变成了手中的武器，就在当年红军经过的大渡河岸上，开始了向大自然的进军。
    你看，那尘灰弥漫的山岗上，四川石棉矿的工人们，举起了劳动竞赛的红旗。噜噜发响的高空架索道，飞送着晶莹发光的石棉矿体。它那洁白的纤维，像发丝那样柔细，可以编织成各种石棉成品，用来绝缘、耐酸、耐碱、耐高温，是工业生产中不可缺少的贵重器材之一。据史书记载，后汉桓帝时，大将军梁冀的一件烈火烧不燃的仙衣，就是用石棉织成的。这个矿山，自1918年开采后，它的产品很快博得了中外的称誉。英国有位“石棉大王”收藏了一把一百零八公分长的石棉，就自认为“稀世之珍”，可是，这儿的石棉最长的却达一百二十八公分。这里矿藏丰富，矿床连绵数十里，年产石棉达一万余吨，是目前中国最大的石棉矿区。
    随着石棉矿的不断扩建，五年前还只有六、七间茅屋的荒坝，现已变成了新兴的拥有四、五千人口的工业城镇，一幢幢崭新的瓦屋楼房，屹立在大渡河河岸上。（未完）
