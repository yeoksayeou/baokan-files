Correctly Understand the Tasks and Role of Democratic Parties
Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy

"The united front, armed struggle, and Party building are the three magic weapons by which the Chinese Communist Party defeated the enemy in the Chinese revolution." This is a scientific conclusion that Chairman Mao Zedong drew long ago based on his many years of rich revolutionary experience. The Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the eleven years of experience since the Seventh National Congress, further proving the complete correctness of this conclusion. As Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the Eighth National Congress: "In terms of domestic conditions, our victory was achieved by relying on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, and by extensively uniting all forces that could be united." "Internationally, our victory was achieved by relying on the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the deep sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world." Therefore, in order to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, while continuing to strengthen the unity of the entire Party, we must also continue to strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations, and continue to consolidate and expand our people's democratic united front; internationally, we must further develop friendly cooperation with fraternal countries in the socialist camp and strengthen solidarity with all peace-loving countries. The spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions runs through all the documents of the "Eighth National Congress," and the various guidelines and policies on economy, culture, domestic affairs, and foreign affairs determined by the "Eighth National Congress" are concrete programs for implementing this spirit. As members of the democratic parties that are part of the people's democratic united front, we must have a profound understanding of this.

With the decisive victory of the socialist revolution, fundamental changes have taken place in our domestic class relations, and our people's democratic united front has entered a new stage. The worker-peasant alliance, which is the foundation of the people's democratic united front, has been established on a brand-new socialist common foundation. Although the national bourgeoisie has not been completely eliminated as a class, most bourgeois elements have begun to become employees of joint public-private enterprises and some state-owned enterprises. The contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class has been basically resolved. Although there will still be class contradictions and struggles in the future, this kind of class contradiction is no longer the main contradiction in our country at present, and its nature is not antagonistic. The main method of resolving contradictions is through study, transformation, and persuasion and education. After several years of ideological remolding and practical training, the political attitude of Chinese intellectuals has basically turned to the side of the working class. Most intellectuals have become part of the working class, and after the socialist revolution entered a climax, they all expressed their willingness to contribute all their strength to socialism. All these changes show the strengthening of the consistency of the people's democratic united front, marking the further consolidation and expansion of the people's democratic united front, and creating extremely favorable conditions for continued consolidation and expansion. It is under such historical conditions that the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties. The proposal of this policy is not only of great significance in our domestic political life, but also has a positive impact internationally. Implementing this policy is the solemn political task of our democratic party members, and we must understand this policy from the fundamental policy of the united front and overcome various negative factors in our thinking.

Most of our country's democratic parties were established after the War of Resistance Against Japan. Taking the China Association for Promoting Democracy as an example, from the time of its establishment, it actively participated in the people's democratic united front led by the Chinese Communist Party, opposed Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, and advocated democratic politics. Under the circumstances at that time, because the Chinese Communist Party was forced to be in a secret state in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, it was inconvenient to carry out activities publicly. The democratic parties, according to their own characteristics, had certain social connections and had a very deep influence on the masses they contacted. Therefore, many tasks were promoted by the democratic parties, so that the democratic parties played a significant role in the democratic revolution. At that time, everyone's view of the democratic parties was relatively consistent. When the War of Liberation was won and the People's Republic of China was established, some people in our democratic parties had different views. They believed that "democratic politics has been realized, the task of the democratic parties has been completed, and it should be ended." This view obviously only started from the narrow goal of the democratic parties themselves to strive for democracy, and did not take into account the fundamental policy of the united front, nor did it estimate the important role of the people's democratic united front in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the country's transition period and in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies. It was still due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party that helped them correct this incorrect view, and thanks to the active support and vigorous assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, the organizations of the democratic parties have been continuously developed and consolidated since liberation, and they have continued to make new contributions to a series of political movements and social changes. However, does this mean that many people have a thorough understanding of the nature and tasks of the democratic parties and the fundamental policy of the united front? Of course not. Whenever there is a major change in the domestic situation and new problems are raised, it causes various kinds of confusion in many people's thinking. For example, after the general line and general task of the country's transition period were clearly put forward, some people believed that the democratic parties would not exist for long, "the day socialism is built is the autumn when the democratic parties die." They felt that when it comes to socialism, classes are eliminated, and the democratic parties will also die out. After the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, many people doubted "why the democratic parties can coexist for a long time," and even after the "Eighth National Congress" was held until now, some people are still conducting tedious discussions on this issue.

In fact, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said very clearly in his political report at the "Eighth National Congress": "The social basis of China's democratic parties is the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie, and their intellectuals. After the completion of the socialist transformation, the members of the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie will become part of the socialist laborers. The democratic parties will become the political parties of this part of the laborers. Because the remnants of bourgeois ideology will still drag on for a long time among this part of the laborers, the democratic parties still need to continue to contact them, represent them, and help them transform for a long time. At the same time, the long-term coexistence of the democratic parties with the Communist Party can also play a role of mutual supervision between the various parties." This means that the long-term existence of the democratic parties has its objective social basis with historical origins, and it has the tasks to continue to undertake in the people's democratic united front. In order to unite all possible forces at home and abroad, to build socialism, and to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible, the democratic parties have much work to do. Why can't the democratic parties coexist for a long time? Members of the democratic parties should not hesitate to strengthen their work, strive for self-transformation, and better complete the tasks they undertake in the people's democratic united front.

The more the democratic parties can work deeply among the masses they contact, turn useless forces into useful forces, and turn negative factors into positive factors, the more they can make more contributions to the cause of socialist construction. Taking the China Association for Promoting Democracy as an example, in the past few years, in the work of contacting the masses and developing the organization, we have inappropriately emphasized the progressiveness of the CAPD, and we are unwilling to approach those who are slower to progress, fearing that absorbing them into the association or reflecting their opinions and requirements more will affect the progressiveness and purity of the CAPD. This cannot but affect the development of our various tasks and hinder us from fully playing our role in the people's democratic united front. In fact, it is precisely those who demand progress but are slower to develop politically who are more eager for the democratic parties to give them help, and the democratic parties themselves are a political organization of a united front nature, and they are also more suitable for doing their work. If we retreat due to their more backward ideas, then we have not truly understood the nature and tasks of the democratic parties, and we have abandoned the responsibility of the advanced to lead the backward. The problem is not that they have more backward ideas, the problem is our work. If we can start from the policy of the united front, assume our due responsibilities, strengthen our work, contact them, represent their legitimate interests, help them transform, shorten their distance from the Party and government, and make their strength fully and effectively play in the socialist cause, then not only will it not affect the progressiveness of our democratic parties, but it will also exercise and improve ourselves in practical work.

An important key to consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front still lies in strengthening the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. After the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, some people thought that the democratic parties could do their own thing, which is a very wrong and harmful idea. Experience has proved that the reason why our people's democratic united front was able to play such a huge role in the past revolutionary stage is mainly due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party. If we leave the leadership of the Communist Party and do not have a solid worker-peasant alliance as the foundation, our people's democratic united front is unimaginable. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the policy that the Communist Party and the democratic parties coexist for a long time and supervise each other, first of all, it is a policy to supervise the Communist Party, because the Communist Party is the leading core of our cause, the mass line is the fundamental line of the Party, only by fully mobilizing the masses, expanding democratic life, and supervising the Party from all aspects, overcoming the mistakes of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, and ensuring the correctness of the Party's leadership, can the socialist cause of our country be better and faster developed. Only the working class, the great Marxist-Leninist party that is politically mature, can put forward the policy of mutual supervision so selflessly and welcome the supervision of the masses and all relevant parties. The democratic parties accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and mutual supervision are not only not contradictory at all, but are complementary to each other. Since the democratic parties have participated in the state power under the leadership of the Communist Party and serve socialism, they have the responsibility to conduct mutual supervision in political and state affairs; and mutual supervision is precisely to reduce deviations, correct mistakes, strengthen the Party's leadership, and better serve socialism. Therefore, any one-sided emphasis on the aspect of mutual supervision while ignoring the aspect of the Party's leading role will not only be detrimental to the expansion and consolidation of the people's democratic united front, but will also hinder the transformation and progress of members of the democratic parties.

    正确认识民主党派的任务和作用
    中国民主促进会副主席　王绍鏊
    “统一战线，武装斗争，党的建设，是中国共产党在中国革命中战胜敌人的三个法宝”。这是毛泽东主席根据多年革命的丰富经验早就得出的科学结论。中国共产党第八次全国代表大会总结了“七大”以来十一年的经验，更证明了这一结论的完全正确。正如毛主席在“八大”开幕词中所说：“就国内的条件来说，我们胜利的获得，是依靠了工人阶级领导的工农联盟，并且广泛地团结了一切可能团结的力量。”“在国际范围内，我们胜利的获得，是依靠了以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的支持，以及全世界爱好和平的人民的深厚同情。”因此，为了把我国从一个落后的农业国改变成为一个先进的工业国，在继续加强全党团结的同时，还必须继续加强各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结，继续巩固和扩大我们的人民民主统一战线；在国际上还必须进一步发展同社会主义阵营中各个兄弟国家的友好合作，并且同一切爱好和平的国家加强团结。毛主席的指示精神贯穿在“八大”的全部文件中，“八大”所决定的关于经济、文化、内政、外交等各项方针、政策就是贯彻这个精神的具体纲领。作为人民民主统一战线组成部分的各民主党派成员，对此必须有深刻的认识。
    随着社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利，我们国内的阶级关系已经发生了根本变化，我国人民民主统一战线也进入了一个新的阶段。作为人民民主统一战线基础的工农联盟已经建立在崭新的社会主义的共同基础上。民族资产阶级作为一个阶级来说，虽然还没有最后消灭，但是大多数资产阶级分子已经开始成为公私合营企业和一部分国营企业的从业人员，资产阶级和工人阶级之间的矛盾已经基本解决，今后虽然还有阶级矛盾和斗争，但是这种阶级矛盾已经不是我们国内当前的主要矛盾，它的性质也不是对抗性的，解决矛盾的主要方法是通过学习改造和说服教育的方法，我国知识分子经过几年来的思想改造和实际锻炼，他们的政治态度已经基本上转向工人阶级方面来，大多数的知识分子已经成为工人阶级的一部分，在社会主义革命进入高潮之后，都表示要为社会主义贡献一切力量。所有这些变化，都表明人民民主统一战线一致性的加强，标志着人民民主统一战线进一步巩固和扩大，并且为继续巩固和扩大创造了极为有利的条件。正是在这样的历史条件下，中国共产党中央提出了共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针，这一方针的提出，不仅在我们国内政治生活中有重要的意义，而且在国际上也有积极的影响。贯彻执行这一方针，乃是我们民主党派成员庄严的政治任务，我们必须从统一战线的根本政策出发来领会这一方针，克服思想上的各种消极因素。
    我国各民主党派大部分是在抗日战争以后成立的，以中国民主促进会来说，从成立之时起就积极参加了中国共产党领导的人民民主统一战线，反对蒋介石的反动统治，主张民主政治。在当时的情况下，由于中国共产党在蒋介石统治区被迫处于秘密状态，不便公开进行活动，而各民主党派根据本身的特点都有一定的社会联系，在他们所联系的群众中有很深的影响，因此许多工作都推动民主党派出面来做，从而使民主党派在民主革命的过程中发挥了显著的作用。那时大家对民主党派的看法是比较一致的。到了解放战争胜利，中华人民共和国成立的时候，我们民主党派中有些人就有了不同的看法，他们认为“民主政治已经实现，民主党派的任务已经完成，应该结束了”。这种看法显然只是从民主党派本身的狭隘的争取民主的目标出发，而没有考虑到统一战线的根本政策，没有估计到人民民主统一战线在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中的重大作用。还是由于中国共产党的正确领导，帮助他们纠正了这种不正确的看法，并且由于中国共产党的积极支持和大力协助，各民主党派组织在解放以后不断得到了发展和巩固，他们对一系列的政治运动和社会变革不断作出新的贡献。但是，是不是这样就使得许多人对民主党派的性质任务和统一战线的根本政策有了彻底的认识了呢？当然不是。每逢国内情况有了重大变化提出了新的问题之后，便引起了许多人在思想上发生这样那样的混乱，例如在国家过渡时期总路线、总任务明确提出以后，就有些人认为民主党派存在的时间不会长了，“社会主义建成之日，民主党派消亡之秋”。他们觉得到了社会主义，阶级消灭了，民主党派也就消亡了。中共中央提出了共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针之后，又有许多人怀疑“为什么民主党派能够长期共存”，甚至在“八大”开会以后直到现在，还有一些人对这个问题进行烦琐的讨论。
    其实，刘少奇委员长在“八大”的政治报告中说得非常清楚：“中国各民主党派的社会基础是民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和它们的知识分子。在社会主义改造完成以后，民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的成员将变成社会主义的劳动者的一部分。各民主党派就将变成这部分劳动者的政党。由于在这部分劳动者中，资产阶级思想的残余还会拖得很长，各民主党派还需要在一个很长的时间内继续联系他们，代表他们，并且帮助他们改造。同时，各民主党派同共产党一道长期存在，在各党派之间也能够起互相监督的作用。”这也就是说，民主党派的长期存在有其带有历史渊源的客观的社会基础，并且有它在人民民主统一战线中继续担负的任务。为了团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，建设社会主义，尽快地把我国从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，民主党派有许多工作要做，为什么民主党派不可以长期共存呢？各民主党派成员应当毫不迟疑地加强工作，努力自我改造，更好地完成在人民民主统一战线中所担负的任务。
    各民主党派越能在所联系的群众中深入工作，把无用的力量变为有用的力量，把消极的因素变为积极的因素，就越能对社会主义建设事业作出更多的贡献。拿中国民主促进会来说，过去几年来在联系群众发展组织的工作中都不适当地强调民进的进步性，不愿接近那些进步较慢的人，生怕吸收他们入会或者多反映了他们的意见和要求，就会影响民进的进步性和纯洁性。这样就不能不影响我们各项工作的开展，阻碍了我们在人民民主统一战线中充分发挥作用。事实上，正是那些要求进步而政治上开展较慢的人，才更加迫切地要求民主党派给以帮助，而且民主党派本身就是一种统一战线性质的政治组织，也比较适合于做他们的工作。如果由于他们有较多的落后思想，我们就退避三舍，那就是没有真正了解民主党派的性质和任务，放弃了先进带动后进的责任。问题不是在于他们有较多的落后思想，问题是在于我们的工作。如果我们能够从统一战线的政策出发，负起我们应尽的责任，加强我们的工作，联系他们，代表他们的正当利益，帮助他们改造，缩短他们同党政的距离，使他们的力量在社会主义事业中得到充分的有效的发挥，那就不仅不会影响我们民主党派的进步性，而且会在实际工作中锻炼和提高我们自己。
    巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线的一个重要关键，仍然在于加强中国共产党的领导。在长期共存、互相监督的方针提出以后，有人以为民主党派可以自搞一套了，这是十分错误和有害的思想。经验证明，我们的人民民主统一战线在过去的革命阶段中所以能发生如此巨大的作用，主要原因就是共产党的正确领导，如果离开共产党的领导，没有巩固的工农联盟做基础，我们的人民民主统一战线是不可想像的。中国共产党中央提出了共产党和各民主党派长期共同存在，互相监督，首先是对共产党起监督作用的方针，就是因为共产党是我们事业的领导核心，群众路线是党的根本路线，只有充分发动群众，扩大民主生活，从各方面对党进行监督，克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的错误，保证党的领导的正确，才能使我国的社会主义事业得到更好更快的发展。也只有工人阶级的在政治上成熟的伟大的马克思列宁主义的政党，才能这样大公无私地提出互相监督的方针，欢迎人民群众和各有关方面的监督。各民主党派接受共产党的领导和互相监督，不仅没有丝毫矛盾，而且是相辅相成的。既然各民主党派在共产党的领导下参加了国家政权，为社会主义服务，就有责任在政治上和国家事务中进行互相监督；而互相监督也正是为了减少偏差，纠正错误，加强党的领导，更好地为社会主义服务。因此，任何片面强调互相监督的一面而忽视党的领导作用的一面，不仅不利于人民民主统一战线的扩大和巩固，而且将阻碍民主党派成员的改造和进步。
