Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 20th: As previously reported, Pietro Nenni, Secretary-General of the Italian Socialist Party, delivered a lengthy political report at the Socialist Party Congress on the evening of February 6th. In addition to discussing the domestic situation in Italy, the report focused on the relationship between the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party, the issue of united action between Socialists and Communists, his evaluation of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and his views on the Hungarian events.

Speaking about the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Nenni said that the congress supported and promoted the policies of easing tensions and peaceful coexistence, and made new conclusions on issues such as whether war is avoidable and the path to socialism, which were the two "positive factors" of the congress. However, the "methods used by the congress in destroying Stalin's cult of personality" were "disappointing."

Nenni called some of the errors and shortcomings that occurred in the Soviet Union under the cult of personality "degeneration," and said, "The cause of this degeneration is less human beings or people than institutions and organizations, and its main root lies in the economy." He believed that the economic policies implemented by the Soviet Union before World War II were "reactionary" and "made the institutions and organizations also become reactionary," and that the crux of the problem was the lack of "democracy" and "freedom."

Next, Nenni talked about the Hungarian events. Nenni did not consider it a counter-revolutionary riot provoked by domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces taking advantage of the Hungarian people's legitimate dissatisfaction with the mistakes made by the former leaders, but simply a demonstration by "workers and students" demanding "democracy" and "freedom." Although he admitted that during the riots, "some dregs of the Horthy regime had floated to the surface" and "there was a threat from reactionary forces," he still believed that the Soviet army's assistance in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots at the invitation of the Hungarian government was "interference" in Hungary and "perhaps the most serious mistake since the October Revolution." Nenni also expressed disagreement with the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government's resolute measures to suppress the counter-revolution, saying, "These measures restored fascism."

Nenni told the Congress that the issues he had discussed above had an impact on the merger of the Socialist parties. He said, "These events have made it urgently necessary for us to reconsider and clarify the relationship between socialism and freedom, and between socialism and democracy in Italy."

Nenni then spoke about the unity of the working class, including Communists. He emphasized that this unity "has been damaged by the Hungarian events."

He said that this damage was not caused by the stance taken by the Socialist Party, "All we have done is draw the necessary conclusions from the Hungarian events." He then emphasized that unity should not become a "superstition" or a "myth." He believed that "it is necessary to fight for the recognition of the inalienable and eternal values of democracy and freedom in order to restore unity on this basis." He explained that the "democracy" he was talking about was not only an ultimate goal, but also a method in practice; "democracy" meant universal suffrage, parliament, and a multi-party system; and "freedom" meant "respect for the forms of freedom stipulated by the constitution" and liberating people from exploitation and poverty.

Nenni stated that the socialism adhered to by the Socialist Party was different from both reformism and communism. In his view, the communist parties in some Western countries "uncritically accepted" the methods and practices of the Soviet proletariat dictatorship, thus creating a "dictatorship of the party, a dictatorship of the party leadership, and a bureaucracy," which "limited, and even partially destroyed, its (communism's) own progress."

Nenni also discussed the relationship between the Italian Socialist Party and the Social Democratic parties of various countries and the "Socialist International." He particularly praised the British Labour Party and the West German Social Democratic Party. He stated that the Italian Socialist Party had changed its attitude to a favorable one towards the "social democratic movement for a United States of Europe." He also stated that his party was considering rejoining the "Socialist International." In terms of foreign policy, Nenni advocated that Europe become a "neutral group of countries," with "Soviet troops withdrawing from the countries participating in the Warsaw Pact and American troops withdrawing from the countries of the Atlantic Group." He believed that "In this way, Europe can no longer be at the mercy of the United States, and no longer needs to fear the Soviet Union. Europe can regard the issue of European unification in political, economic and military terms as a matter of establishing peace and mutual rapprochement between the West and the East." He also said: "The problem we face in foreign policy is not condemning the Atlantic Pact, but condemning the fact that people have not understood and implemented this pact from a strictly defensive perspective."

Finally, Nenni put forward three tasks for the Italian Socialist Party in the future: to strive for the merger of socialist parties; to block the path of the Catholic regime's attempts to restore power; and to strive to solve domestic social and economic problems and prevent the interests of workers from continuing to suffer sacrifices. He also specifically issued an appeal to the Social Democratic Party for a merger of the two parties.

### 南尼在社会党代表大会的报告

    南尼在社会党代表大会的报告
    新华社20日讯　罗马消息：前已报道，意大利社会党总书记彼特罗·南尼在社会党代表大会2月6日晚间会议上作了长篇政治报告。这篇报告除了谈到意大利国内情况外，着重地谈到了社会党和社会民主党之间的相互关系问题以及社会党人和共产党人行动一致的问题，也谈到了他对苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的评价以及对匈牙利事件的看法等。
    在谈到苏共第二十次代表大会的时候，南尼说，这次大会支持及推动了缓和紧张局势和和平共处的政策，并且在战争可否避免及走向社会主义的道路等问题上作出了新的结论，这是大会的两个“积极因素”。但是，大会“在摧毁斯大林个人崇拜时所用的方法”是“令人失望的”。
    南尼把苏联在个人崇拜的风气下发生的一些错误和缺点叫作“退化”，并且说：“造成这种退化的与其说是人类或人们，不如说是制度和组织机构，而它的主要根源在于经济。”他认为苏联在第二次世界大战以前所实行的经济政策是“反动的”，“而且使得制度和组织机构也变成反动的”，并且认为问题的症结在于没有“民主”、“自由”。
    接着，南尼谈到匈牙利事件。南尼不认为那是匈牙利国内外反革命势力利用匈牙利人民对前领导者所犯错误的正当不满而挑起的一次反革命暴乱，而认为那只是“工人和学生”要求“民主”“自由”的一种示威行动。虽然，他承认，在暴乱中，“霍尔蒂旧政权的某些渣滓曾经浮上表面”，“当时存在着反动势力的威胁”，但是他仍然认为苏军应匈牙利政府的邀请协助镇压反革命暴乱是对匈牙利的“干涉”，“也许是十月革命以后最严重的错误”。南尼还表示不同意匈牙利工农革命政府镇压反革命的坚决措施，他说：“这些措施恢复了法西斯主义”。
    南尼告诉代表大会说，他谈到的上面这些问题是对社会党合并有影响的。他说：“这些事件使得我们眼前就迫切需要在意大利重新考虑和澄清社会主义和自由之间、社会主义和民主之间的关系。”
    南尼接着谈到了包括共产党人在内的工人阶级团结的问题。他强调指出，这种团结“已经由于匈牙利事件而受到损害”。
    他说，这种损害并不是由于社会党所采取的立场造成的，“我们所做的，只是从匈牙利事件中归纳出必要的结论”。他接着强调团结不应当变成一种“迷信”和“神话”。他认为，“必须进行斗争，争取民主和自由的不可剥夺的永恒价值获得承认，以求在这个基础上恢复团结。”他解释说，他所说的“民主”，不但是指一个终极目的，也是指在实践中的一种方法；“民主”是普选权利、议会和多党制；而“自由”，就是指“尊重宪法所规定的自由的形式”和把人从剥削、贫困中解放出来。
    南尼表示，社会党所信守的社会主义不同于改良主义，也不同于共产主义。在他看来，西方一些国家的共产主义政党“不加批判地接受了”苏联无产阶级专政的方法和实践，因而造成了“党的独裁，党领导集团、官僚机构的独裁”，这样就“限制了，甚至部分毁灭了它（共产主义）自己的前进。”
    南尼还谈到意大利社会党同各国社会民主党和“社会党国际”的关系。他特别赞扬了英国工党和西德社会民主党。他表示，意大利社会党对于“争取欧洲合众国的社会民主运动”，已经改变为赞成的态度。他还表示，他的党正在考虑重新参加“社会党国际”的问题。在外交政策方面，南尼主张欧洲成为一个“中立国家集团”，“苏联军队退出参加华沙条约各国和美国军队退出大西洋集团各国”。他认为：“这样作，欧洲就可以不再听任美国摆布，再也用不着畏惧苏联。欧洲就可以把在政治、经济和军事方面的欧洲统一问题看作西方和东方之间建立和平和双方重新接近的问题。”他还说：“我们在外交政策方面所面临的问题，不是谴责大西洋公约的问题，而是谴责人们没有从严格的防御的角度来理解和实行这个公约的问题。”
    南尼最后提出了意大利社会党今后的三项任务：争取社会主义政党合并；堵塞天主教政权试图复辟的道路；争取解决国内的社会与经济问题及阻止劳动者的利益继续蒙受牺牲。他还特别向社会民主党发出两党合并的呼吁。
