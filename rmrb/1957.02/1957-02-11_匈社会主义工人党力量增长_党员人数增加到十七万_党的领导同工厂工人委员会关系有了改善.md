Xinhua News Agency, 10th – According to a report by the German News Agency, Mátyás Rákosi, member of the Provisional Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of State of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, said on the 9th that the membership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has now increased to 170,000. He emphasized that the increase in party membership shows that the party's strength has grown.

Mátyás Rákosi made the above remarks in a conversation with the German News Agency's correspondent in Budapest. He also said that the relationship between the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party and the factory workers' committees has greatly improved. Today, the party's slogan of "Communists participate in the workers' committees" is being realized.

Mátyás Rákosi said that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is now taking the offensive. Since mid-December last year, progressive forces have been counterattacking, and a difficult but victorious battle is being waged in industry and agriculture. The enemy can no longer organize general strikes. This is because the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government continues to gain increasing trust from the people. Workers are satisfied that the government openly discusses current difficulties with them.

Speaking on economic issues, Mátyás Rákosi pointed out that the continuous increase in coal production and the huge assistance provided to Hungary by the socialist camp have helped to reduce the number of unemployed in Hungary.

    匈社会主义工人党力量增长
    党员人数增加到十七万
    党的领导同工厂工人委员会关系有了改善
    新华社10日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，匈牙利社会主义工人党临时中央委员会委员、工农革命政府国务部长马罗山在9日说，匈牙利社会主义工人党的党员现在已经增加到十七万了。他强调指出，党员人数的增加说明党的力量已经壮大起来。
    马罗山在对德意志通讯社驻布达佩斯记者谈话时说了上面这些话。他还说，社会主义工人党的领导同工厂工人委员会的关系已经有了很大的改善，今天，党所提出的“共产党员参加工人委员会”的口号正在实现。
    马罗山说，匈牙利社会主义工人党现在正在采取攻势。自从去年12月中旬以来，进步力量就在反攻，在工业、农业方面正在进行着一场艰苦的但也是胜利的战斗。敌人现在再也不能组织总罢工了。这是由于工农革命政府继续获得人民越来越大的信任的原故。工人们对政府公开同他们讨论当前的困难感到满意。
    马罗山在谈到经济问题的时候指出，煤产量的不断提高和社会主义阵营给予匈牙利的巨大援助，有助于匈牙利失业人数的减少。
