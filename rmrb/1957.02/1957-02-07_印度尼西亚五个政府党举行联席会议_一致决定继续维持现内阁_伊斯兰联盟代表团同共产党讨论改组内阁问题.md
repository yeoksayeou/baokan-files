Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th: The five Indonesian government parties held a joint meeting this morning at the residence of Suwirjo, Chairman of the Indonesian National Party. After the meeting, Suwirjo, as the spokesperson for the meeting, announced that all government parties had decided to continue to maintain the current cabinet until the government's second reading defense to the parliament on the evening of February 12.

The meeting also decided that before the government's second reading defense to the parliament on the Sumatra issue on February 12, the five government parties should hold another meeting to discuss the issue of large-scale cabinet reorganization and the steps to be taken in the future.

Suwirjo said that the development of the situation "gives people great hope."

The Chairman of the Indonesian Christian Party, Tambunan, once announced that his party would demand the dissolution of the cabinet by February 15, otherwise his party would withdraw its cabinet members. Today, the Central Committee of this party issued a written statement saying that the Central Committee did not set a deadline. The Indonesian Catholic Party, which also proposed forming a new cabinet, also has inconsistent internal opinions.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th: A delegation from the Central Committee of the Indonesian Islamic League Party, led by Rashid, visited the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party today. The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, and Central Committee member Sipoyo received them.

The delegation from the Central Committee of the Indonesian Islamic League Party explained to Aidit and others the party's recent statement on a "comprehensive" reorganization of the cabinet. The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party expressed its agreement that the reorganization of the cabinet should be discussed jointly by the leaders of various political parties and the President.

The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party stated that when the matter is still limited to the reorganization of the current cabinet, it is not necessary to discuss the issue of the Communist Party joining the cabinet. However, if a cabinet crisis occurs or a widespread reorganization is carried out that effectively amounts to the organization of a new cabinet, then the Communist Party hopes to consider organizing a cabinet that includes the Communist Party. Such a cabinet would greatly strengthen domestic unity in Indonesia to ensure that the Indonesian people can wage a stronger struggle against foreign intervention.

    印度尼西亚五个政府党举行联席会议
    一致决定继续维持现内阁
    伊斯兰联盟代表团同共产党讨论改组内阁问题
    新华社雅加达6日电　印度尼西亚五个政府党今日上午在印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约住宅举行联席会议，会后苏维约以会议发言人的身份宣布会议的决定说，所有政府党决定继续维持现内阁，直至2月12日晚上政府向国会作二读答辩。
    会议又决定在2月12日政府向国会作关于苏门答腊问题的二读答辩之前，五个政府党要再举行一次会议，讨论关于大规模改组内阁的问题和今后应采取的步骤。
    苏维约说，到现在为止，情势的发展“给人以莫大的希望”。
    印度尼西亚基督教党主席潭布兰曾经宣布，他的党将以2月15日为期要求解散内阁，否则他的党将撤回阁员。今天，这个党的中央委员会发表书面声明说，中央委员会并未提出期限。另一个提出要另组新内阁的印度尼西亚天主教党，内部意见也并不一致。
    据新华社雅加达6日电　以拉希德为首的印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党中央委员会代表团，今日访问了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会。由印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会总书记艾地和中央委员西波约接见。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党中央委员会代表团向艾地等说明了这个党最近发表的关于“全面”改组内阁的声明。印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会方面表示同意由各政党领袖和总统一同协商改组内阁。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央方面表示，当事情还只限于改组现内阁的时候，可以不必讨论关于共产党入阁的问题。但是，如果内阁发生危机或进行广泛的改组以致实际上是等于组织新内阁，那么，共产党就希望考虑组织一个包括共产党在内的内阁。这样的内阁将大大加强印度尼西亚国内的团结，以保证印度尼西亚人民能够进行更强大的反对外国干预的斗争。
