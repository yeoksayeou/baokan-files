According to the Liberation Daily: Since the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions convened a conference for new workers and young workers in December last year, many factories and enterprises have strengthened political and ideological education for new workers to help them improve their ideological awareness. After the new workers' ideological awareness improved, they consciously corrected the phenomenon of not abiding by labor discipline.

Among the new workers in the New Asia Machine Factory in Changning District, about 20% of them used to wash their hands and eat before the end of the working day. After the district recently held a meeting for new workers, and the factory organized discussions to encourage everyone to examine this phenomenon of not abiding by labor discipline, no one is now washing their hands before the end of the working day.

Not long ago, the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Factory invited elderly female worker Shi Xiaomei to tell the story of her participation in the May 30th Movement. The new workers were very moved after listening to it. Some said, "When Shi Xiaomei struggled, she didn't distinguish between day and night, and sometimes didn't sleep for several days. She never complained. Now our working hours are eight hours a day, and we have Sundays off. It's really too shameful not to abide by labor discipline." At present, the phenomena of being late, leaving early, asking for leave without reason, and absenteeism have rarely occurred among the new workers in the factory.

The Shanghai Chemical Factory commended a group of new workers who love their work and abide by labor discipline, which greatly encouraged everyone. Young worker Shen Dawei used to be inattentive at work, wandering around. After the help of his comrades, he is now not only working well and abiding by labor discipline, but also actively participating in social work.

In the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Factory, many young workers originally did not abide by labor discipline. Chen Yuguo, a new young worker, beat two veteran workers within two months of entering the factory; new worker Chen Kunlun was not at ease working in the factory and engaged in improper relationships with women outside the factory, and some people even came to the factory gate to argue with him; some young new workers did not respect veteran workers very much, and would glare at them if something was wrong, and even fought them. The Youth League organization paid attention to this problem. First of all, the members of the Youth League Committee talked to the new workers individually and found that most of them did not understand the purpose of life. The Youth League cadres then educated them to combine their future with the country's socialist cause. Then, they held a League class on the theme of "Love our cause, love our work," guiding young workers to establish goals and cultivate young people's interests in life. In addition, in order to provide employees with a proper after-work life, the factory carried out a variety of recreational activities. After doing all the above work, the young workers' lives became richer, the atmosphere of the entire factory also changed, the phenomena of being late and leaving early and other violations of labor discipline decreased, and the enthusiasm for learning technology also increased. 70% of the young workers signed apprenticeship contracts. With the help of his master Zhou Jieqian (Youth League group leader), Chen Yuguo has made progress in both his thinking and work, and is now able to independently manufacture some simple parts. They have all regarded the League organization as their confidant and are willing to talk to the League cadres about their troubles, difficulties, and problems.

However, there are still some factories that do not pay enough attention to the education of new workers, so some new workers have not yet established a love of labor, and labor discipline is still very lax. Some young workers have embarked on the criminal path of corruption, degeneration, and theft because of gambling and extravagance.

### 上海许多工厂加强劳动纪律教育  新工人开始树立新思想新作风

    上海许多工厂加强劳动纪律教育
    新工人开始树立新思想新作风
    据解放日报讯　自从去年12月上海市工会联合会召开新工人、青年工人会议以后，很多工厂企业都加强了对新工人的政治思想教育，帮助他们提高思想觉悟。新工人的思想觉悟提高以后，都自觉地纠正了不遵守劳动纪律的现象。
    长宁区新亚机器厂新工人中，过去大约有20％的人经常不到下班时间就洗手吃饭，经过最近区里开了新工人会议，厂里组织讨论，启发大家检查了这种不遵守劳动纪律的现象以后，现在再没有人在下班前就洗手了。
    上海钢铁公司三厂不久以前请老年女工施小妹讲她参加五卅斗争的故事，新工人听了很感动，有人说：“施小妹斗争的时候，不分白天、黑夜，有时一连几天不睡觉，她从来没有怨言。现在我们的工作时间每天八小时，还有星期日，再不遵守劳动纪律实在太惭愧了。”目前，该厂新工人中迟到早退、无故请假、旷工的现象已很少发生。
    上海化工厂表扬了一批热爱工作、遵守劳动纪律的新工人，对大家的鼓舞很大。青年工人沈大伟，原来工作时不专心，东走西荡。经过同志们的帮助，现在他不但工作很好，遵守劳动纪律，并且积极参加社会工作。
    上海第一钢厂原来有许多青年职工不遵守劳动纪律。青年新工人陈驭国进厂后两个月中就打了两个老师傅；新工人陈昆仑在厂里工作不安心，在外面搞不正当的男女关系，甚至有些人跑到厂门口来跟他吵闹；有的青年新工人很不尊重老师傅，一个不对劲就瞪起眼来，并发生过动手打人的事情。青年团组织注意了这个问题。首先，团委委员分别找新工人谈心，发现他们大部分都不了解生活的目的。青年团干部就教育他们把自己的前途和国家的社会主义事业结合起来。接着便办了以“热爱我们的事业，热爱我们的工作”为题的团课，指导青年工人树立努力的目标，培养青年的生活志趣。此外，为了使职工有正当的业余生活，厂内开展了多样的文娱活动。做了以上种种工作后，青年工人的生活内容充实起来，整个厂的风气也有了转变，迟到早退等不遵守劳动纪律的现象减少了，学习技术的劲头也高涨起来，有70％的青工订了师徒合同。陈驭国在他的师傅周介倩（青年团小组长）的帮助下，思想和工作都有进步，现在已能独立制造一些简单的零件。他们都已把团组织作为自己的知心人，有什么苦闷、困难、问题，都愿意向团干部去谈了。
    但是还有些工厂，对新工人的教育工作还不够注意，因而部分新工人还没有树立起热爱劳动的思想，劳动纪律还很松弛。有的青年工人因为赌博、挥霍浪费而走上了腐化堕落和偷窃的犯罪道路。
