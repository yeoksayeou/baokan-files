After the autumn harvest last year, amidst successive reports of increased production and bumper harvests, a strange atmosphere permeated the rural areas of Xinhui County, Guangdong Province. In summary: the masses' morale was low, the cadres' enthusiasm was waning, and the initial enthusiasm of the cooperative movement was no longer felt. How to continue to move forward on the basis of the first year of cooperation? A clear direction seemed to be lost.

Why was this happening? Was it that cooperation had gone wrong?

The facts provided exactly the opposite answer: the agricultural cooperative system in Xinhui County had shown great superiority over the past year, and this was a clear and obvious fact.

Last year, although the county suffered from drought, the average yield of rice per mu reached 660 jin, an increase of 40 to 50 jin compared to the previous year, and exactly double the average of 330 jin per mu in 1950. The county's cash crops, except for tangerines, which saw a slight decrease in production due to drought and lack of fertilizer, saw slight increases in other fruit trees, silkworms, and fish ponds. After criticizing the tendency of single-product production, the production of various sideline occupations greatly developed in the second half of last year. The number of live pigs has recovered to 130,000 (an average of more than 100 per cooperative), and the number of breeding ducks has increased to more than 140,000, both reaching historical highs. The number of vegetable ducks reached more than 2 million, more than five times the historical high. Of the county's more than 1,200 cooperatives, 90% increased production. Ninety-five percent of cooperative members in the county increased their income. Many cooperative members increased their income by a large proportion, with some as high as one to two times. For example, the average household income of Meibei First Cooperative was 310 yuan the year before last, but it was 660 yuan last year, an increase of more than one time. The average household income of Nada First Cooperative was 399 yuan the year before last, but it was 720 yuan last year, an increase of more than 80%. The income of about half of the cooperative members in the county who increased production has reached or exceeded the level of the original upper-middle peasants.

The specific situations of some agricultural cooperatives I personally saw basically conformed to the above. Take the Zhouqun Township Agricultural Cooperative, for example: this cooperative increased rice production by 29% last year, pond fish production by 33.3%, mulberry production by 20%, and silkworm cocoons, pigs, and ducks all increased. The total income of the cooperative was more than 440,000 yuan, and the net income excluding costs reached more than 318,000 yuan; each work day earned 1.65 yuan; the average income per household was 406 yuan (including household sideline occupations). In addition, the total public accumulation of the cooperative averaged 108 yuan per household. Of the 696 households in the cooperative, 98.5% increased their income. The ten well-off middle peasant households that joined the cooperative last year saw one household's income remain the same as the year before, and nine households increased their income; all twelve households that were originally rich peasants also increased their income. Poor peasant cooperative member Xie Guanghao's income was 232 yuan the year before last and 546 yuan last year, an increase of 135%. The cooperative's production level exceeded the level of the original well-off middle peasants. The thirty-one "Five Guarantees" households received 1,440 yuan in subsidies last year, an average of more than 46 yuan per person; the forty-six households in difficulty also received 980 yuan in assistance, increasing their income.

The cooperative has generated tremendous appeal. Of the more than 7,000 individual peasant households in the county that had not joined the cooperative during the high tide of cooperation, 5,600 households joined; the number of peasant households joining the cooperative increased from 96% to 99%.

Since this was the case, why did the strange phenomenon of low morale among the masses and waning enthusiasm among the cadres occur? After research and analysis, the county party committee believed that there were several reasons: First, political work had been abandoned, and there was a lack of socialist education in the countryside. Cadres and the masses were buried in labor and meetings day and night, and they could not see or did not fully see the great achievements of cooperation over the past year. Second, when focusing on checking and criticizing subjectivism, coercion and commandism, and bureaucratic work styles in the second half of the year, there was not enough affirmation of achievements, and the line between right and wrong was not clearly drawn, which led to a tendency of cadres to refrain from bold leadership for fear of choking, and to let things drift. In addition, there were indeed some shortcomings and problems in the cooperative. Some backward elements or cooperative members with dissatisfaction exaggerated and publicized the shortcomings and problems, which made it difficult for some of the masses to distinguish between right and wrong on many issues. For example, some people compared the total production income before joining the cooperative with the actual income after joining the cooperative and complained that "income was reduced"; some people confused natural disasters with the shortcomings of the cooperative, saying that the cooperative did not have any advantages. In fact, these were all misunderstandings.

In order to distinguish right from wrong and correct public opinion, the county party committee has already been combining rectification with the cooperatives throughout the county, using methods such as cooperative summaries and household accounting to promote achievements, strengthen confidence, and make the entire rural work continue to move forward, first of all to make this year's spring plowing work better than last year's.

    明是非，正视听	黄向青
    去年秋收后，在陆续传来增产、丰收的喜讯中，广东省新会县农村里却弥漫着一股不对劲的空气，概括说来就是：群众情绪不高，干部劲头不大，合作化初期的那股子热情感觉不到了。怎样在合作化第一年的基础上继续前进？似乎失去了明确的方向。
    为什么会这样？是不是合作化坏了事呢？
    事实作了恰恰相反的答案：一年来农业合作制度在新会县显示了极大的优越性，这是明明白白的事实。
    去年这个县虽然受过旱灾，但全县平均每亩水稻产量达到六百六十斤，比前年增加四十到五十斤，比1950年的平均每亩三百三十斤，恰好增加了一倍。全县的经济作物，除柑桔因旱和缺乏肥料稍为减产外，其他果树、蚕桑、渔塘都略有增产。批判了生产单一化的倾向以后，去年下半年各种副业生产大大发展，生猪已恢复到十三万头（平均每个社一百头以上），母鸭发展到十四万多只，都已达到了历史上的最高水平。而菜鸭则发展到二百多万只，超过了历史上最高水平的五倍多。全县一千二百多个社，有90％增产了。全县95％的社员增加收入。许多社员增加收入的比例是很大的，高的达到一倍至两倍。如梅北一社前年每户收入三百一十元，去年是六百六十元，增加一倍多；那大一社前年平均每户收入三百九十九元，去年是七百二十元，增加80％以上。全县有一半左右的增产社社员收入已经赶上或超过了原来上中农的水平。
    我亲眼看到的一些农业社的具体情况，基本上同上面说的情况相符合。以周群乡农业社来说吧：这个社去年稻谷增产29％，塘鱼增产33.3％，桑增产20％，蚕茧、猪、鸭子都增加了。全社各项收入合计四十四万多元，除成本外纯收入达到三十一万八千多元；每个劳动日分得一元六角五；每户平均收入四百零六元（家庭副业在内）。另外，全社的公共积累，按户平均每户有一百零八元。全社六百九十六户，98.5％增加了收入。去年才入社的十户富裕中农，一户收入同前年一样，九户都增加了收入；有十二户原是富农的户也全部增收。贫农社员谢光好，前年收入二百三十二元，去年收入五百四十六元，增加135％。全社的生产水平超过了原来富裕中农的水平。三十一户“五保”户，去年得到照顾的补助金就有一千四百四十元，每人平均四十六元多；困难户四十六户也得到了九百八十元的照顾，增加了收入。
    合作社发生了巨大的吸引力，全县在合作化高潮中未入社的七千多户单干农民，有五千六百户入社了；全县入社农户从96％增加到99％。
    既然这样，为什么却出现了群众情绪不高、干部劲头不大的奇怪现象呢？县委研究分析后，认为有这样一些原因：首先是因为放弃了政治工作，农村中缺乏社会主义教育，干部群众日日夜夜埋头在劳动和会议里面，看不到或没有全面地看到一年来合作化的巨大成就。其次，下半年着重检查和批判主观主义、强迫命令和官僚主义作风的时候，对成绩肯定的不够，是非界限没有划清，以致在干部中产生了因噎废食、放任自流、不敢大胆领导的倾向。加以合作社里确实存在着一些缺点和问题，一些落后分子或有不满情绪的社员，把缺点和问题加以渲染和宣扬，就使一部分群众在许多问题上分不清是非了。例如有些人把入社前生产总收入和入社后实收入比较而吵闹“减少了收入”；有些人把自然灾害同社的缺点混淆起来，说合作社并没有什么优越性。其实，这些都是误解。
    为了明是非正视听，县委已经在全县范围内结合整社，用社社总结、户户算帐等方法来发扬成绩、坚定信心，使整个农村工作继续向前推进，首先是使今年的春耕工作做得比去年更好。
