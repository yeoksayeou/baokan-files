Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Yahu Village Agricultural Cooperative in Shanqiandian Township, Laiyang County, Shandong Province, has decided to implement a system of divided management authority between the Management Committee and production teams in its operational management this year, to enhance the enthusiasm of each team in managing production.

    In the past, because the Management Committee was in charge of everything in this cooperative, the work of the Management Committee was not only very passive and chaotic, but also the handling of many issues often did not correspond to the actual situation at the lower levels. The initiative and enthusiasm of each production team in production and operation were damaged to a certain extent.

    Recently, this cooperative defined the boundaries of divided management authority between the Management Committee and the production teams. In terms of production, the area and yield targets for various crops and basic farmland construction are all under the responsibility of the Management Committee, and the teams have no right to change them at will; as for specific issues such as which plot of land is suitable for which crop and what operating methods to adopt, each production team can arrange them independently according to local conditions, and the Management Committee will not interfere. In terms of finance, the Management Committee, based on the actual needs of each team and the economic conditions of the cooperative, and on the principle of thrift, allocates a certain amount of funds and various materials such as farm tools and fertilizers to each team for use. Under normal circumstances, the cooperative will not supplement the team if they use more, nor will it recover the unused portion if they use less; the Management Committee will not interfere with how each team specifically allocates these financial and material resources. In addition, when arranging the planting area of various crops, the Management Committee also reserves fifteen or sixteen mu of mobile land for each team. The Management Committee only stipulates the output value for these lands, not the type of grain, and each team can decide for themselves what they want to plant.

    After the delegation of authority by the Management Committee, the work of the production teams has increased compared to before. In order to strengthen the leadership of the teams, the cooperative has also made corresponding adjustments in the allocation of cadres, so that each production team is equipped with three team leaders, in charge of production, finance, and political work respectively; the members of the Management Committee also have fixed divisions of labor to specifically assist the work of the production teams.

### 社管委会和生产队适当分权管理生产

    社管委会和生产队适当分权管理生产
    据新华社讯　山东省莱阳县山前店乡崖后村农业社确定今年在经营管理工作中，实行管理委员会和生产队分权分管的办法，提高各队经营生产的积极性。
    过去，这个社因为事事都由管委会掌管，使管委会的工作不仅非常被动忙乱，并且许多问题的处理往往不能与下面的实际情况相符。各生产队在生产经营上的主动性和积极性受到一定的损害。
    最近这个社规定了管委会和生产队之间分权分管的界限。在生产方面，各种作物的面积、产量指标和农田基本建设等，统由管委会负责掌管，各队无权随意变更；至于那块地适宜种那种作物，和采取怎样的操作方法等具体问题，都由各生产队因地制宜地自行安排，管委会不加干涉。在财务方面，管委会根据各队的实际需要和社的经济条件，本着节约的原则，把一定数量的资金和农具、肥料等各种实物分别包给各队使用，在一般情况下各队用多了社里不再增补，少用了也不再收回；对于这些财力物力各队如何具体支配，管委会也不予干涉。另外，管委会在安排各种作物种植面积的时候，还给每个队留出了十五、六亩可以机动的土地，管委会对这些土地只规定产值，不规定粮种，各队愿意种什么可以自行确定。
    管委会权限下放以后，生产队的工作已较前加重，为了加强队的领导，这个社在干部配备上也作了相应的调整，使每个生产队都配备三个队长，分别掌管生产、财务和政治工作；管理委员会委员也作了固定分工，具体帮助生产队的工作。
