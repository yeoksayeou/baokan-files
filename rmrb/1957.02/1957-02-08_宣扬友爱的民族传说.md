    National Legends Promoting Friendship
    Qin Mu
    When I was in the Wuzhi Mountain area of Hainan Island, I personally asked several Li ethnic youths about local legends about the origin of their people, through an interpreter.
    Because these kinds of legends often contain the ancestors of various ethnic groups' understanding of the world, the features of primitive society, and even people's life aspirations, etc.
    A Li youth who was studying at a normal school told me that the folk legend he had heard about the origin of the Li people was as follows: In ancient times, after a great flood, only a brother and sister were left in the world. They married each other because they could not find other partners anywhere. After the marriage, they produced a large meatball. The ashamed brother cut it into ten pieces, throwing five pieces onto the high mountains and five pieces into the flowing water. The crows ate two pieces that were thrown onto the mountains. The pieces thrown into the water flowed to the plains. The meat pieces on the mountains became the Li people. Because some of them were eaten by crows, the Li people were few. The meat pieces in the water flowed to the plains and became the Han people. Because these meat pieces did not suffer any loss, the Han people are more numerous than the Li people.
    Another Li youth told me a different legend: It is said that the first humans were born from a pair of giant old monkey couples. The old monkey couples gradually took on human form because of their labor. The large number of their descendants originally born died in a flood. The old monkey couples floated in a large turtle shell and were able to avoid the disaster. After the flood receded, they gave birth to three pairs of children: the first pair were the ancestors of the Li people, the second pair were the ancestors of the Han people, and the third pair were the ancestors of the Miao people.
    These seemingly strange and bizarre legends actually contain some things that are worth noting.
    Every nation in the world has its own myths about the "creation of the world." Egyptian mythology says that humans were created by the great god Hrum using clay. Hebrew mythology says that God created the man Adam from clay and then created the woman Eve from Adam's rib. Greek mythology says that the great god Zeus molded people out of clay. The Chinese Han mythology says that Pangu used an axe to open up the heavens and the earth…. If we strip away the mythological cloak from these famous legends, we can see some things. That is: the profound and far-reaching influence of the invention of pottery technology on the lives of ancient humans, people's praise for labor, the reflection of male-centered ideology in mythology after the collapse of clan society, and so on.
    Similarly, if we strip away the mythological cloak from the legends of the Li people about the origin of their nation, we can also see: Besides the memory of the terror of the flood era (almost all ethnic groups around the world mention the flood in their legends about the creation of the world, and these legends, like some weathered stones, record real history), the vague feeling about the truth that labor creates culture, the lament for the hardship of life, etc., there are also simple voices promoting national friendship. Look, don't the legends of the Li people about the creation of the world mention that all ethnic groups are brothers?
    As common as the legends about floods, there are many myths and legends among the various minority ethnic groups in China that talk about the various ethnic groups being brothers. For example, the Yi people have many such stories.
    The myths and epics of the Axi people, a branch of the Yi people, also mention a brother and sister who survived a flood and married to reproduce humanity. In the Axi story, it is said that the younger sister gave birth to a large pumpkin after marriage, which made human voices. Later, the elder brother split it open with an axe, and many people jumped out, including Han people, Miao people, and Yi people... The Han people went to the plains, the Miao people went to the grasslands, and the Yi people went to the mountains. This is how they came to live in their respective places.
    The legends of the Yi people in Yunnan are so similar to the legends of the Li people in Hainan Island. This is truly meaningful and worth in-depth study by ethnic scholars! These ethnic groups, located in the north and south, far apart, have such similar ethnic legends, which cannot help but make people think that perhaps in distant ages, they had extremely close relations, and then one branch drifted across the ocean, which made them part ways and grow further and further apart. We laymen have no way to clarify this kind of thing. What I want to say is that in these myths, there is a voice that is so loud, that through those strange plots, it is constantly calling out: "Ethnic groups should be brothers! They should love each other!"
    Through a long history of national oppression, these ethnic stories, which hide a solemn voice of justice, have been passed down from generation to generation, which makes one imagine that even in those bleak years, countless ethnic brothers, with their good wishes, playing the Lusheng and blowing the Xiao, entrusted their feelings and ideals in the memories of ancestral legends: "We should be like brothers!" The voices of the ancestors have echoed in the hearts of many people for generations, just like the torch relay in the Olympic Games, generation after generation of people have passed this torch down from the storm!
    This is a solemn voice of justice! Compared with those fallacies that have appeared in many places in the world, expressing national prejudice, such as saying that such and such nation is the most excellent, and such and such nation is an inferior nation, this is much more great and sublime. People who stubbornly adhere to ethnic superiority and prejudice may live a civilized material life, but in terms of thoughts and feelings about ethnic relations, they are no different from the savages of the "headhunting tribes." People who promote national friendship may live a simple life, but in terms of thoughts and feelings about ethnic relations, they are closely connected with the people of the communist era. This torch of national friendship was lit by the wise ancestors of all ethnic groups, and they were passed down from generation to generation, experienced dark storms, and sometimes almost extinguished, but it was finally passed down and ignited a long-lasting and beautiful bonfire in the new era.
    The history of mankind's more general understanding of the principles of biological evolution is only about a hundred years old, and it is natural for various ethnic groups to have some bizarre legends about the creation of the world. From these bizarre legends, we cannot help but think of those wise and righteous ancestors of various ethnic groups in our country. Think of their benevolent eyes, gentle voices, their burning hearts and beautiful thoughts. Thinking of these people, and thinking of the principles of Marxist ethnic relations, we will more resolutely spurn the despicable Han chauvinism, or kick away the pitiful narrow nationalism!

### 宣扬友爱的民族传说

    宣扬友爱的民族传说	秦牧
    在海南岛五指山区的时候，我曾经通过翻译，亲自向几位黎族青年询问过当地关于民族起源的传说。
    因为这一类的传说里面常常包藏着各族的先民对于世界的认识，原始社会的风貌，以至人们生活的愿望等等。
    正在念师范的一位黎族青年告诉我，他所听到的关于黎族起源的民间传说是这样的：在古代一次洪水泛滥之后，世上只留下一对兄妹，他们在到处寻不到其他配偶的情形下结了婚。婚后产下一个大肉球。羞愤的哥哥把它斩成十块，五块抛上高山，五块丢下流水。丢上山的给乌鸦吃了两块。丢下水的流向平原。山上的肉块变成了黎人。因为有一些给乌鸦吃了，所以黎族人少。水里的肉块冲向平原，变成了汉人。因为这些肉块没有受到什么损失，所以汉族比黎族人多。
    另一个黎族青年告诉我的却又是另一种传说：据说最初的人类都是一对巨大的老猴子夫妇生下来的。老猴子夫妇因为做工，所以渐渐具备了人形。他们原来生的大批子孙都在一次洪水中死去了。老猴子夫妇坐在大龟壳里漂流，得以避过灾难。洪水退后，他们又生下了三对儿女：第一对是黎族的祖先，第二对是汉族的祖先，第三对是苗族的祖先。
    这种看似离奇怪诞的传说，里面实际上蕴藏着一些很值得注意的东西。
    世界各个民族都有各自关于“创世纪”的神话。埃及神话说人类是大神赫鲁木用粘土塑造成的。希伯来神话说上帝用泥土造成了男人亚当，又抽亚当的肋骨造成了女人夏娃。希腊神话说大神宙斯用粘土塑成了人。中国汉族的神话说盘古用斧凿开辟了天地……。这些著名的传说，如果剥去了神话的外衣，我们是很可以看到一些东西的。这就是：制陶技术的发明对古代人类生活影响的深广、人们对于劳动的赞美、氏族社会崩溃后男性中心思想在神话中的反映等等。
    同样的，黎族人民关于民族起源的传说，如果剥去了那神话的外衣，我们也可以看到：除了这里面有古代人们对洪水时代的恐怖的回忆（全世界各民族关于创世纪的传说几乎都谈到了洪水，这些传说正和一些饱历沧桑的石头同样纪录了真实的历史）、对于劳动创造了文化这一真理的隐约的感觉、对于生活艰苦的咏叹等等之外，还有宣扬民族友爱的朴素的声音。瞧，在黎族人民关于创世纪的传说中，不是都提到了所有的民族都是弟兄的这一回事么？
    同关于洪水的传说那样的普遍，国内各个少数民族的神话传说中，讲到各个民族是弟兄的，数量很是不少。如彝族，他们就有不少这一类的故事。
    彝族中的一支，阿细族的神话史诗中，也提到一对经过洪水泛滥劫后仅存的兄妹，结婚繁衍了人类的故事。在阿细族的故事中，讲的是妹妹结婚后生下了一个大南瓜，里面发出了人声，后来哥哥用斧头把它剖开，里面跳出了许多的人，有汉人、有苗人、有彝人……，汉人向平原走去，苗人向草原走去，彝人向山岭走去。这就成为它们以后各自居住的地方。
    云南彝族的传说竟和海南岛黎族的传说这样的相像，这真是意味深长，值得民族学者深入钻研的一回有趣的事！这些天南地北，遥远相隔的民族有着这样如出一辙的民族传说，真不禁使人想起也许在遥远的年代中，他们原曾发生过极密切的关系，此后有一个支系飘洋渡海了，这才使他们分道扬镳，越离开越远了。这类的事情我们外行人是没法弄明
    白的。我想讲的只是，在这些神话中，有一个声音是多么嘹亮啊，它通过那些奇特的情节，不断地在呼唤：“民族和民族之间应该是弟兄！应该相爱！”
    通过长期间的民族压迫的历史，这些藏着一个庄严的正义声音的民族故事居然能世代流传下来，可以想见：就在那些惨淡的岁月里，也有无数民族弟兄怀着他们的善良的愿望，奏着芦笙、吹着洞箫，在回忆祖先传说中寄托他们的感慨和理想：“我们应该像兄弟一样啊！”先民们的声音就这样世世代代响在许多人们心头，就像奥林匹克大会中的火炬传递一样，一代代的人们把这火炬从暴风雨中传递下来了！
    这是一个庄严的正义的声音！这比较那些在世界许多地方曾经出现过的，表现民族偏见的谬说，如说什么什么民族最优秀，什么什么民族是下等民族之类的观念，不知要伟大崇高多少万倍了。固执着民族优越偏见的人们，也许过着文明人的物质生活，然而在民族关系上的思想感情，却和“猎头部落”的野蛮人没有什么分别。宣扬民族友爱的人们，也许过着朴素简陋的生活，然而他们在民族关系上的思想感情，却和共产主义时代的人类息息相通。这民族友爱的火炬，曾经为一切民族的有智慧的祖先所燃点，它们一代代被传递下来，经历过晦冥风雨，有时几乎熄灭，然而它终于传下来了，并在新时代中燃起了长明的美丽的篝火。
    人类比较普遍明白生物进化的道理的历史还不过一百年左右，各个民族有一些关于创世纪的离奇传说是很自然的事。从这些离奇传说中，我们仍不禁想起了国内各个民族的那些智慧和正义的先人。想起他们仁爱的眼睛，温和的声音，他们心头的烈火和美好的思想。想起这些人，想起马克思主义的民族关系的原则，我们就会更坚决地去唾弃那可鄙的大汉族主义，或者踢开那可怜的狭隘的民族主义！
