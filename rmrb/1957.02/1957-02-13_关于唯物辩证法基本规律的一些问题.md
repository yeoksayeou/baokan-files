    Some Questions on the Basic Laws of Materialist Dialectics
    Guan Feng

    Currently, in the philosophical community, there are some important issues being debated regarding the basic laws of materialist dialectics. These issues are largely raised due to the demands of life and scientific progress for dialectics to advance. Therefore, in-depth research and discussion of these issues are urgently needed and extremely beneficial. However, some issues have already been resolved by Marxism-Leninism; of course, since there are differences of opinion, there is a need for research and discussion to overcome these differences.

    Regarding the Law of the Unity and "Struggle" of Opposites

    (I) Do fundamentally opposed and mutually exclusive phenomena have identity (i.e., unity)?

    The "Concise Philosophical Dictionary" states: "Sometimes, some people mistakenly apply the Marxist principle of identity to some fundamentally opposed phenomena. For example, some people say that peace and war are identical; others say that under the capitalist system, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are identical, and so on. Such a simplistic understanding of identity is actually an abuse of Hegelian terminology, which is particularly favored by Menshevik idealists. Phenomena such as war and peace, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, life and death, etc., cannot be identical because they are fundamentally opposed and mutually exclusive."

    Do fundamentally opposed and mutually exclusive phenomena have identity? This involves understanding the basic content of the law of "the unity and 'struggle' of opposites."

    The principle of identity in Marxist dialectics reveals that the two aspects of a contradiction, which are opposed to each other, are interdependent and interconnected; and, under certain conditions, the positions of the two aspects can be mutually transformed. Calling this situation identity, unity, consistency, mutual penetration, mutual communication, mutual dependence, or mutual connection all mean the same thing. This identity of contradiction is relative, and the struggle is absolute. Struggle is inherent in identity. This is a basic principle of Marxist dialectics. This principle is very clearly explained in Lenin's "On the Question of Dialectics" and Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction."

    The two aspects of a contradiction can both be said to be fundamentally opposed (i.e., struggle is absolute) and mutually exclusive. If they were not fundamentally opposed and mutually exclusive, how could a contradiction be formed? However, they are also identical. If there is no identity, that is, if they are not interconnected, how can they struggle? For example, war and stone have no identity, that is, they are not interconnected and cannot be mutually transformed; therefore, there is no mutual exclusion or struggle between them, that is, they do not constitute a contradiction. The "fundamentally opposed phenomena" referred to by the "Dictionary" editors refer to the two extremes of the same thing. However, they also have identity. For example, life and death, "Without life, death cannot be seen; without death, life cannot be seen." Engels said: "Today, physiology that does not regard death as an essential factor of life, that does not understand that the negation of life is essentially contained in life itself, is no longer considered scientific." "Death is always contained in life in embryonic form." "...Physiology explains that death is not a sudden, fleeting event, but a continuous process." "At every moment, some cells of its (referring to the organism - translator's note) organism are dying, while other new cells are being produced." Obviously, this refers to the identity of interdependence and mutual transformation between life and death. Another example is the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Under the capitalist system, they are two classes in opposition to each other. But there is also identity between them: without the bourgeoisie, there would be no proletariat, and without the proletariat, there would be no bourgeoisie; and their positions of ruling and being ruled can be transformed under certain conditions. If they are isolated from each other, without identity, and do not coexist in capitalist society, having a myriad of economic and political connections, how can they struggle against each other? The same is true of war and peace. War and peace can be mutually transformed. Moreover, just as there is no war, there is no peace; if there is no phenomenon of war at all in society, then there would be no "peace" in the current sense. After communism is realized throughout the world and the phenomenon of war is completely eliminated, the connotation of the concept of "peace" will also undergo a fundamental change. All fundamentally opposed phenomena are like this, such as dictatorship and democracy, misfortune and fortune, harm and benefit, and so on.

    Marxist dialectics recognizes the relative stability of things in order to distinguish it from sophistry and relativism; on the other hand, it recognizes the absoluteness of the contradictory movement of things in order to distinguish it from metaphysics.

    Metaphysics understands identity as a rigid identity without contradiction, a permanent identity without change. Their thinking formula is: "Yes - Yes, No - No." Struggle cannot have identity, and identity cannot have struggle. Denying that there are contradictions within the "same thing"; denying that the contradictory parties have identity, are all metaphysical viewpoints. The term "unity of opposites" has the meaning of reconciling contradictions in Hegel; therefore, some people advocate not using this term for fear of being confused with Hegel's thought of reconciling contradictions. In fact, the problem is not in the term but in the essence; Marxist dialectics believes that the unity of opposites is relative and the struggle is absolute, which strictly distinguishes it from Hegel's thought of reconciling contradictions and "equilibrium theory."

    The article "A Few Opinions on 'Identity of Contradiction'" in the second issue of "Philosophical Research" last year made a correct criticism of the view that "fundamentally opposed and mutually exclusive phenomena have no identity." Currently, there are still differences of opinion among philosophy researchers on this issue; moreover, this issue is directly related to the expression of the law as the core of dialectics: some call this law "unity of opposites," some call it "unity and 'struggle' of opposites," and still others call it "development is the 'struggle' of opposites." The author believes that although this issue has already been resolved by Marxism-Leninism, it still needs in-depth research to thoroughly criticize the metaphysical distortion of dialectics. While criticizing the tendency to deny the identity of contradictions, we should also pay attention to preventing another tendency of one-sidedly emphasizing identity and neglecting struggle.

    (II) The Question of Antagonism and Non-Antagonism and Their Mutual Transformation Under Certain Conditions

    In China's academic circles, there has been a heated discussion on whether the contradiction between the Chinese working class and the national bourgeoisie is antagonistic or non-antagonistic. This involves several philosophical theoretical issues, namely: (1) What is antagonism? What is an antagonistic contradiction? Is the antagonistic form of struggle the same as the antagonism of contradiction? (2) In society, what determines the antagonism of contradiction (or the antagonistic nature of contradiction)? (3) Is the principle of mutual transformation between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions universal under certain conditions?

    The Soviet philosophical community is discussing whether there are antagonistic contradictory factors in the socialist system. In his paper "Contradictions in the Development of Socialist Society and Ways to Overcome Them" (translated and published in "Learning Translation Series" No. 10, 1955), Ts. Stepanian criticized the view that there are no antagonistic contradictory factors in the socialist system. He pointed out that the main and decisive characteristic of contradictions in socialist society is the non-antagonistic nature of contradictions. However, building socialism and communism in the environment of struggle between two camps, there will be antagonistic phenomena. The struggle against those who steal public property, against the corrupt bourgeois ideas that infiltrate our society, and against spies and acts of treason has an antagonistic nature. Er. Kogan and I. Glazunov expressed their support for the above point of view (translated and published in "Learning Translation Series" No. 4, 1956). They elaborated on Stepanian's point of view, mainly: those who are hostile to us cannot represent the interests of any social group in the country, and the contradiction with these people is antagonistic; the contradiction between socialist ideology and bourgeois ideology is antagonistic, but the contradiction with people who are loyal to the socialist motherland but have remnants of capitalist ideology is not antagonistic.

    In practical life, it is meaningful to distinguish between antagonistic contradictions and non-antagonistic contradictions; but it seems more important theoretically and practically to clarify how antagonism and non-antagonism transform into each other under certain conditions, and to overcome the metaphysical view on this issue—absolutizing the difference between antagonism and non-antagonism, believing that antagonism is antagonism, and non-antagonism is non-antagonism, which can neither contain the nature of its opposite nor be transformed into its opposite. This metaphysical view cannot solve practical problems. People cannot determine whether to solve a problem in an antagonistic or non-antagonistic form based on subjective wishes. However, in class society, we can grasp the law that antagonism and non-antagonism transform into each other under certain conditions, so as to determine flexible class struggle strategies, unite all forces that can be united, and strike the main enemy; and under the socialist system, people can also prepare various conditions according to objective laws, so that contradictions that are originally non-antagonistic do not turn into antagonism, or that certain antagonistic factors can be resolved in a non-antagonistic form. We need to conduct research in this area in connection with reality.

    (III) Principal Contradiction and Central Link

    Some comrades believe that since the principal contradiction "plays a leading and decisive role" and the secondary contradiction is in a "subordinate position," the principal contradiction is the central link in the work. Grasping the central link is to grasp the principal contradiction and solve the principal contradiction, "Once the principal contradiction is grasped, all problems will be solved easily." Comrades who hold this view also believe that around the high tide of agricultural cooperation, agricultural cooperation was the central link in the work, and therefore it was the specific principal contradiction in the economic development of the transition period at a certain stage.

    Other comrades believe that the central link may be the principal contradiction, but it is not necessarily the principal contradiction; it may also be one aspect of the principal contradiction, or it may be a weak link in the work. Of course, the central link of each period revolves around solving the principal contradiction. They believe that the central link in the work is a decisive link for solving the principal contradiction formed by the development of contradictions in the process and changes in the external environment.

    In the past, it was generally believed that the central link was the essential connection of things. This is of course correct. But it is too general and difficult to specifically guide people to grasp the central link in their work. Therefore, the author believes that it is very necessary to analyze and study the central link from the internal contradictions of things. Currently, this discussion has not been in-depth, and philosophical workers and leaders of practical work need to vigorously conduct research.

    Regarding the Law of Transformation from Quantitative Change to Qualitative Change

    (IV) Are there only two basic forms of leap?

    Since the publication of Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," the philosophical community has generally recognized that there are two basic forms of leap, namely, explosive leap and gradual leap (or expressed as non-explosive leap). This year, some people in China's philosophical community have put forward a new view, believing that there is a form of leap (such as water freezing into ice) that is neither gradual nor explosive; the statement that there are two basic forms of leap cannot comprehensively and accurately summarize the characteristics of real leaps. Therefore, it is proposed that there are three basic forms of leap, namely: explosion, gradual, and sudden. Some comrades oppose this view, their main reason being that the so-called explosive leap, that is, a leap realized through a decisive blow by the new side to the old side, the "sudden" leap should be included in the type of explosive leap, and it is redundant to propose a third form of leap. The author believes that the latter view is logically tenable; however, can the original definition of explosive leap be reconsidered? The view that there are three basic forms of leap is worthy of attention. Is it more accurate to reflect reality to regard the sudden but non-"explosive" leap as a basic form, and to understand the explosive leap as a veritable "explosion"? Of course, if the view that there are three basic forms of leap can be established, it is also necessary to further study the similarities and differences between "gradual" and "sudden," "sudden" and "explosion," as well as the internal contradictions and external conditions that form these various forms of leap.

    (V) Does gradual leap have a stage of quantitative change for preparation?

    Some comrades believe that gradual leap has no stage of quantitative change preparation, that is, there is no clear boundary between quantitative change and qualitative change, and quantitative change and qualitative change are intertwined throughout the development process (leap) of the entire thing. The process of agricultural cooperation in our country is like this.

    Some comrades oppose this view. They believe that any qualitative change has its stage of quantitative change preparation, and gradual leap is no exception. Of course, quantitative change also contains qualitative elements, and there is a gradual accumulation of new qualitative elements and a gradual decline or aging of old qualitative elements in the quantitative change stage; quantitative change is also a struggle between the new and the old, and it is impossible not to do so. But this change reaches its "critical point" and "turning point" before it causes a leap, and the qualitative definition of things undergoes a fundamental change. In the process of agricultural cooperation in our country, the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative is the emergence of a new qualitative element, which is a leap from the perspective of this village, and it also has its own stage of quantitative change preparation; but from the perspective of the whole country, when cooperatives are still individual and small in number, it is quantitative change, not qualitative change, that is, the rural areas of small-scale peasant economy have not undergone fundamental changes. The arrival of the high tide of cooperation is the beginning of the leap from small-scale peasant economy to socialist collective agricultural economy; before this was the stage of quantitative change preparation, and this leap was prepared by the entire economic and political work of the party and the state. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has a similar situation. The author believes that this view is basically correct. The former view will inevitably lead to a difficult understanding of the law of transformation from quantitative change to qualitative change: it seems that the quantitative change stage has no qualitative elements, only abstract "numbers" are changing; and with qualitative elements, no matter how small the quantity is, it is qualitative change, not quantitative change. Obviously, in this way, the understanding of the relationship between quantity and quality falls into the metaphysical quagmire.

    From the above two different points of view, it is natural to lead to the debate on when China's socialist revolution began to leap. People who hold the former view believe that the founding of the People's Republic of China was the beginning of the leap; the completion of the socialist society and the end of the transition period was the completion of the leap; and quantitative change was intertwined throughout the entire process. Comrades who hold the second view believe that: (1) From the perspective of the entire history of mankind, the transition period is a great leap; that is, the so-called "leap from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom," which was prepared by the changes in the history of class society. (2) However, from the perspective of the transition period itself, it also has its own stage of quantitative change. The arrival of the high tide of socialist transformation is the beginning of qualitative change; before this was quantitative change. The transformation from an agricultural country to an industrial country also has its stages of quantitative and qualitative change. (Some people also believe that the final cancellation of land dividends by cooperatives and the final cancellation of fixed interest for capitalists in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are qualitative changes; the arrival of the high tide is not the beginning of leap and qualitative change. The author believes that this view is incorrect.)

    Some other comrades basically agree with the above second view; but they believe that there are also situations where quantitative change and qualitative change are intertwined and the stages of quantitative change and qualitative change cannot be divided, such as the transformation from ape to man and the slow evaporation of water in the open air. This is indeed a question worthy of serious study.

    (VI) What are the basic characteristics of explosive leap and gradual leap in social systems?

    Some comrades believe that the basic characteristic of the explosive leap in social systems is to overthrow the existing regime and establish a new regime; the basic characteristic of the gradual leap is that it is realized by the existing regime taking the initiative from top to bottom and the masses supporting it from bottom to top. Therefore, they believe that the land reform after the founding of the People's Republic of China and the elimination of the rich peasant class by the Soviet Union on the basis of the overall collectivization of agriculture were gradual leaps, not explosions.

    Other comrades believe that overthrowing the existing regime and establishing a new regime are not the basic characteristics of the explosive leap in the social system; and the existing regime taking the initiative from top to bottom is not the basic characteristic of the gradual leap. The fundamental difference between these two forms of leap is whether they are realized through a decisive blow or gradually realized. Therefore, they believe that the land reform after the founding of the People's Republic of China and the elimination of the rich peasant class in the Soviet Union were all explosive leaps. The author believes that it is not very accurate to say that the above two leaps, and other similar leaps, are explosive or gradual; can we consider that the leap in social system has three forms: explosion, gradual, and sudden? Of course, research on reality should pay attention to: reality is richer than theory; even if the forms of leap are summarized into three types, it cannot include all the characteristics of various leaps in reality. Therefore, absolutely do not apply any formula rigidly.

    Some comrades also believe that armed struggle is the basic characteristic of the explosive leap in the social system. Based on this, it is concluded that the process of China's new democratic revolution began to leap from the Northern Expedition in 1925 (from the May Fourth Movement, it was its stage of quantitative change preparation), this leap was explosive, long-term, and basically completed until the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    Many comrades oppose this view. They believe that the leap in the process of China's new democratic revolution started in 1947. The reason is that at this time, a turning point was reached, that is, the turning point from the occurrence and development to the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty in the past two decades, and it was the turning point when the Chinese people pushed the wheel of revolution to victory and reversed the wheel of counter-revolution to destruction. It was from this turning point that the revolutionary situation and Chinese society underwent fundamental changes. However, due to the historical characteristics of China, the stage of quantitative change has its own particularities, that is: there is a series of small, local explosive leaps. The establishment of a revolutionary base area is an explosive leap from a local perspective; but from a global perspective, it is still quantitative change, not qualitative change. Because the entire revolutionary situation and the semi-feudal and semi-colonial social nature of China have not undergone fundamental changes; our working line is still to accumulate strength in the countryside for a long time, and to encircle the cities from the countryside, preparing to seize national victory, rather than investing our strength in the decisive battle. The author holds this view, believing that the former view is untenable, the qualitative change of a thing cannot be longer than its stage of quantitative change; and it is not in line with the long-term road of our party to encircle the cities from the countryside, from seizing one position to another, and finally seizing national victory.

    Regarding the Law of Negation of the Negation

    (VII) Is the spiral upward movement the basic content of the law of negation of the negation?

    After the publication of Stalin's booklet "Dialectical and Historical Materialism," the Soviet philosophical community generally believed that the negation of the negation was not one of the basic laws of dialectics; and believed that the negation of the negation was a Hegelian term, and Stalin abandoned it and summarized its positive content in the second and third basic characteristics of dialectics. In China's philosophical community, most people also hold this view. In the past two years, the Soviet philosophical community has criticized this view. Now it seems that no one denies that the negation of the negation is a basic law of dialectics. The debate has turned to whether the spiral upward movement (that is, repeating some characteristics of the previous stage on a higher basis) is the basic content of the law of negation of the negation.

    Some comrades think not. The spiral upward movement, the third stage repeating some characteristics of the first stage on a higher basis, is only the case for some phenomena, not universally. For example, from primitive society to slave society, and then to feudal society, what characteristics of primitive society does feudal society repeat? From slave society to feudal society and then to capitalist society, what characteristics of slave society does capitalist society repeat? (There are many such examples) Therefore, this law is only negation and then negation, or expressed as: "negation of the negation of the negation...", or simply called the law of negation.

    Some comrades oppose this view. They believe that the spiral upward movement, the third stage repeating some characteristics of the first stage on a higher basis, is the basic content of this law. The entire process of the development of things is the three stages of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Engels and Lenin both expressed this law in this way. The problem is that the negation of the negation can only be seen from the entire process. For example, the example mentioned above, the entire process should be: "primitive society → class society (slave society, feudal society, capitalist society) → communist society"; rather than primitive society → slave society → feudal society...". And from the perspective of the entire process of class society, it is also a three-stage process, and capitalism will repeat some characteristics of slave society on a higher basis, namely: the separation of direct producers from the means of production. Comrades who hold this view believe that the law of negation of the negation not only teaches people to critically accept cultural heritage, but also is a weapon for understanding the tortuous development of objective things and completely smashing the theory of circularity.

    The article "The Law of Negation of the Negation" by B. Kedrov, published in the thirteenth issue of the Soviet "Communist" magazine last year (translated and published in "Learning Translation Series" No. 11, 1956), is an article worthy of attention. The author put forward an important point of view - the characteristics of the law of negation of the negation. He pointed out that this law has comprehensiveness and summarizing nature, and this law has the nature of "integration", and has less nature of "differentiation". "Every negation, as a necessary link in all development, has a 'differential' nature. Because, at every moment of development, there is always something that is negated, overcome, and at the same time, there is always something that is affirmed and replaces what is negated and overcome. The 'integral' nature of the law of 'negation of the negation' explains why its role is different from the role of the law of unity and 'struggle' of opposites, not manifested everywhere, but only manifested in such places: here, after the development has completed a certain cycle, repeating some characteristics and features of the past stage on a higher stage." Therefore, "To understand the role of this law, it is not enough to examine only a single stage of the development process, and it is even more insufficient to examine a single moment of development. To reveal the role of this law, it is necessary to examine the entire development process and compare the various stages of this process."

    China's philosophical community's research on the law of negation of the negation is still very insufficient. The arguments of the comrades who hold the second view are mostly examples cited by Engels in "Anti-Dühring," and they cannot completely refute the first view. Now there is an urgent need to explore the law of negation of the negation from history, real life, and natural phenomena, especially the characteristics of this law; to study the significance of applying the law of negation of the negation to the cognitive process, and the fundamental difference between the law of negation of the negation and Hegel's three-stage formula.

    关于唯物辩证法基本规律的一些问题
    关锋
    目前哲学界，关于唯物辩证法的基本规律，有一些重要问题的争论。这些问题大都是由于生活、科学向前发展要求辩证法向前发展而提出来的。因此，对这些问题进行深入的研究和讨论，是迫切需要的，极为有益的。但是，也有的问题，是马克思列宁主义早已解决了的；当然，既然有了意见分歧，就需要进行研究和讨论，克服意见分歧。
    关于对立面的统一和“斗争”规律
    （一）根本对立和相互排斥的现象有无同一性（即统一性）？
    “简明哲学辞典”中说：“有时，有些人错误地把马克思主义的同一性原理应用于一些根本对立的现象。例如：一些人说，和平和战争是同一的；另一些人说，在资本主义制度下，资产阶级和无产阶级是同一的，等等。这样简单地理解同一性其实就是滥用黑格尔的术语，孟什维克式的唯心主义者格外热中于这种做法。像战争与和平、资产阶级和无产阶级、生和死等等现象不能是同一的，因为它们是根本对立和相互排斥的。”
    根本对立和相互排斥的现象有无同一性？这涉及到了对于“对立面的统一和‘斗争’”这一规律基本内容的理解。
    马克思主义辩证法的同一性的原理揭示的是：矛盾着、对立着的两方面，是相互依存、相互联结的；并且，在一定条件下两方面的地位是可以相互转化的。把这种情形，叫做同一性、统一性、一致性、互相渗透、互相贯通、互相依存或互相联结，都是一个意思。矛盾的这种同一性是相对的，斗争性是绝对的，斗争性即寓于同一性之中，这是马克思主义辩证法的基本原理。这个原理，在列宁的“谈谈辩证法问题”和毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”中讲得非常清楚。
    矛盾的两方面可以说都是根本对立（即斗争性是绝对的）和互相排斥的。如果不根本对立和互相排斥，怎么形成矛盾呢？然而它们又是同一的，如果没有同一性，即不互相联结，它们又怎样斗争呢？例如战争和石头，它们之间没有同一性，即不互相联结，也不能相互转化；因而它们之间也无所谓相互排斥和斗争，即不成其为矛盾。“辞典”编者所说的“根本对立的现象”乃是指的同一事物的两极。然而，它们也是有同一性的。例如生和死，“没有生，死就不见；没有死，生就不见”。恩格斯说过：“今天，不把死亡看作生命的重要因素、不了解生命的否定实质上包含在生命自身之中的生理学，已经不被认为是科学的了。”“死亡总是以胚胎形式包含在生命中。”“……生理学说明，死亡并不是一种突然的、倏忽完成的事件，而是一种延续的过程。”“在每一瞬间，它（指有机体——引者注）的机体的一些细胞死亡着，而别一些新的细胞则又产生着。”很显然，这是说生和死相互依存和相互转化的同一性。又例如资产阶级和无产阶级。它们在资本主义制度下，是相互对抗的两阶级。但是它们之间也有着同一性：没有资产阶级就没有无产阶级，没有无产阶级也就没有资产阶级；并且它们的统治与被统治的地位在一定条件下是可以转化的。如果它们互相隔绝，没有同一性，不共同存在于资本主义社会中发生千丝万缕的经济、政治联系，怎么互相斗争呢？战争与和平也是这样。战争与和平可以相互转化。并且，同样是没有战争这一方，就没有和平那一方；社会上根本没有战争的现象，也就没有现在意义下的“和平”，将来全世界实现共产主义之后，根本消灭了战争现象，“和平”这个概念的内涵也要发生根本变化。一切根本对立的现象都是如此，例如专政和民主、祸和福、害和利等等。
    马克思主义辩证法，承认事物的相对的稳定性，以便和诡辩论、相对主义区别开来；又一方面承认事物矛盾运动的绝对性，以便和形而上学区别开来。
    形而上学把同一了解为没有矛盾的死板的同一，没有变化的永远的同一。他们的思维公式是：“是——是，否——否”，斗争就不能有同一，同一就不能有斗争。否认“同一物”内部有矛盾；否认矛盾着的双方具有同一性，都是形而上学的观点。“对立面的统一”这个术语，在黑格尔那里有调和矛盾的意思；因此有人主张不用这个术语，恐怕和黑格尔调和矛盾的思想混淆起来。其实，问题不在于术语，而在于实质；马克思主义辩证法认为对立面的统一是相对的、斗争是绝对的，这就和黑格尔调和矛盾的思想、和“均衡论”严格区别了开来。
    去年“哲学研究”第二期“对‘矛盾的同一性’的一点意见”一文，对于“认为根本对立和互相排斥的现象没有同一性”的观点，提出了正确的批评。目前对这个问题，哲学研究者中还存在着意见分歧；并且，这个问题和作为辩证法核心的规律的表述，是直接关连的：如有的把这个规律称为“对立面的统一”，有的称为“对立面的统一和‘斗争’”，也还有的称为“发展是对立面的‘斗争’”。作者认为，这个问题虽然是马克思列宁主义早已解决了的，但还需要进行深入的研究，彻底批判对辩证法的形而上学的歪曲。在批评否认矛盾的同一性这种倾向的时候，当然也要注意防止片面强调同一性而忽视斗争性的另一种倾向。
    （二）对抗和非对抗及其在一定条件下相互转化的问题
    我国学术界对我国工人阶级和民族资产阶级矛盾的性质是对抗的还是非对抗的，已经进行了热烈的讨论。这里牵涉到几个哲学理论的问题，即：（1）什么是对抗？什么是对抗性的矛盾？对抗的斗争形式是否就是矛盾的对抗性？（2）在社会中，矛盾的对抗（或矛盾的对抗性）是由什么决定的？（3）矛盾的对抗和非对抗在一定条件下相互转化的原理是不是普遍的？
    苏联哲学界正在讨论社会主义制度下有没有对抗性矛盾因素的问题。茨·斯捷潘年在“社会主义社会发展中的矛盾及其克服的途径”论文（译文载“学习译丛”1955年第十期）中，批判了认为在社会主义制度下没有任何对抗性矛盾因素的观点。他指出社会主义社会矛盾的主要的和决定性的特点是：矛盾的非对抗性。但是，在两个阵营斗争环境中建设社会主义、共产主义，那就会有对抗性现象存在。对于盗窃公共财产的人、对于渗入我们社会的腐朽的资产阶级思想、对间谍和叛变祖国行为所进行的斗争，就具有对抗性。尔·柯干、伊·格拉祖诺夫对上述论点表示赞成（译文载“学习译丛”1956年第四期）。他们对斯捷潘年的论点作了一些发挥，主要的是：同我们敌对的人是不能代表国内任何一个社会集团的利益的，和这些人的矛盾是对抗性的；社会主义思想和资产阶级思想的矛盾是对抗性的，但是和忠诚于社会主义祖国而带有资本主义思想残余的人们的矛盾却不是对抗性的。
    在实际生活中区别什么是对抗性的矛盾，什么是非对抗性的矛盾，这是有意义的；但看来更有重要的理论和实际意义的是阐明对抗和非对抗怎样在一定条件下相互转化，克服在这个问题上的形而上学的观点，——把对抗和非对抗的区别绝对化，认为对抗就是对抗，非对抗就是非对抗，既不可能包含其反面的性质，也不可能转化为其反面，这种形而上学的观点是不能解决实际问题的。人们不能根据主观愿望来决定对某个问题用对抗或非对抗的形式来解决。但是，在阶级社会里，我们可以掌握对抗和非对抗在一定条件下相互转化的规律性，从而确定灵活的阶级斗争策略，团结可以团结的一切力量，打击最主要的敌人；而在社会主义制度下，人们也可以根据客观规律来准备各种条件，使得本来是非对抗性的矛盾不至于转化为对抗，或者使某些对抗性的因素能够用非 对抗的形式来解决。我们需要联系实际进行这方面的研究。
    （三）主要矛盾和中心环节
    有些同志认为：既然主要矛盾“起着领导的决定的作用”，次要矛盾处于“服从的地位”，那么，主要矛盾就是工作中的中心环节。抓中心环节就是要抓主要矛盾、解决主要矛盾，“捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了”。持这种意见的同志还认为：在农业合作化高潮前后，农业合作化是工作中的中心环节，因而就是过渡时期的经济发展在一定阶段上的具体的主要矛盾。
    另一些同志认为：中心环节可能就是主要矛盾，但不一定就是主要矛盾；它也可能是主要矛盾的一方面，可能是工作中的薄弱环节。当然每一时期的中心环节都是围绕解决主要矛盾的。他们认为，工作中的中心环节是由过程诸矛盾的发展以及外部环境的变化所形成的对于解决主要矛盾具有决定性的一环。
    过去，一般认为中心环节就是事物的本质联系。这当然是对的。但过于笼统，还难以具体指导人们在工作中去掌握中心环节。因此，作者认为：从事物的内部矛盾分析研究中心环节，是非常必要的。目前这一讨论还没有深入，需要哲学工作者和实际工作的领导者大力进行研究。
    关于由量变到质变转化规律
    （四）飞跃的基本形式是否只有两种？
    自斯大林的“马克思主义与语言学问题”问世以后，哲学界公认飞跃有两种基本形式，即爆发式的飞跃和逐渐性的飞跃（或表述为非爆发性的飞跃）。今年我国哲学界有人提出一种新的见解，认为：有一种飞跃形式（例如水结冰），既非逐渐性的，也非爆发式的；飞跃有两种基本形式的说法，对于现实的飞跃的特点，并不能作全面的确切的概括。因此提出飞跃有三种基本形式，即：爆发、逐渐、突然。有些同志反对这种意见，其主要理由是：所谓爆发性的飞跃，即经过新的一方对旧的一方实行一次决定性的打击而实现的飞跃，“突然”式的飞跃自应归入爆发飞跃的类型，提出第三种飞跃形式是多余的。作者认为：后一种意见在逻辑上是说得通的；但是，爆发式飞跃的原来的定义是否可以重新考虑呢？飞跃有三种基本形式的意见是值得重视的。把突然而非
  “爆发”的飞跃作为一种基本形式，把爆发式的飞跃理解为名副其实的“爆炸”，是不是更能精确地反映现实呢？当然，飞跃有三种基本形式的意见能够成立的话，也需要进一步研究“逐渐”和“突然”、“突然”和“爆发”的相同和不同之点，以及形成这种种飞跃形式的事物内部矛盾和外部条件。
    （五）逐渐性飞跃有没有量变阶段作准备？
    有些同志认为：逐渐性飞跃没有量变准备阶段，即没有量变、质变的分明界限，量变和质变在整个事物发展过程（飞跃）中交错在一起。我国的农业合作化的过程就是这样。
    有些同志反对这种意见。认为任何质变都有其量变准备阶段，逐渐性的飞跃也不能例外。当然量变也包含有质变的要素，量变阶段中也有新质要素的逐渐积累，旧质要素的逐渐衰亡或衰老；量变也是新旧斗争，不这样是不可能的。但这种变化达到它的“关节点”、“转变点”才引起飞跃，事物的质的规定性才发生根本变化。我国农业合作化过程中，一个农业生产合作社的成立就是一个新质要素的出现，从这个村庄来说就是飞跃，并且也有它自己的量变准备阶段；但从全国范围来说，当合作社还是个别的少量的时候，则是量变，不是质变，即小农经济的农村没有发生根本变化。合作化高潮到来，即小农经济向社会主义的集体农业经济飞跃的开始；以前是量变准备阶段，这个飞跃是由党和国家的全部经济工作，政治工作准备好了的。资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也有类似的情形。作者认为这种意见基本上是正确的。前一种意见必然引到对由量变到质变转化规律难以理解的地步：似乎量变阶段没有质变的要素，只是抽象的“数”在变；而有了质变的要素，不管量大小就是质变，而不是量变。显然，这样一来，对于量和质的关系的理解，就陷入了形而上学的泥坑。
    由以上两种不同的观点，很自然地引出了我国社会主义革命从何时开始飞跃的争论。持前一种意见的人，认为从中华人民共和国成立，就是飞跃的开始；到社会主义社会建成、过渡时期终结则是飞跃的完成；而量变则交错在整个过程中。持第二种意见的同志认为：（一）从整个人类历史看来，过渡时期是一个大飞跃；即所谓“由必然的王国到自由王国的飞跃”，它是由阶级社会历史的变化准备好了的。（二）但是从过渡时期本身看来，它也有自己的量变阶段。社会主义改造高潮到来是质变的开始；以前是量变。由农业国到工业国的转化也有其量变和质变阶段。（也有人认为：合作社最后取消土地分红、资本主义工商业改造最后取消资本家的定息，才是质变；高潮到来并不是飞跃、质变的开始。作者认为，这种意见是不正确的。）
    还有些同志，基本同意上述第二种意见；但认为量变质变交错在一起，不能划分量变、质变阶段的情形也是有的，如从猿到人的转化、露天的水慢慢蒸发。这确是值得认真研究的一个问题。
    （六）社会制度的爆发式飞跃和逐渐性飞跃，基本特征是什么？
    有些同志认为：社会制度中的爆发式飞跃的基本特征是推翻现存政权、建立新政权；逐渐性的飞跃的基本特征是由现存政权自上而下的主动进行和群众自下而上的支持实现的。因此认为中华人民共和国成立以后的土地改革，苏联当年在农业全盘集体化基础上消灭富农阶级，都是逐渐性的飞跃，而不是爆发。
    还有些同志认为推翻现存政权、建立新政权并不是社会 制度中爆发式飞跃的基本特征；现存政权的自上而下的主动进行也不是逐渐飞跃的基本特征。这两种飞跃形式的根本区别在于是经过一次决定性的打击实现的，还是逐渐实现的。从而认为中华人民共和国成立以后的土地改革、苏联的消灭富农阶级，都是爆发式的飞跃。作者认为上述两种飞跃、还有其他类似的飞跃，说是爆发式的或逐渐的都不太确切；是否可以考虑社会制度的飞跃有爆发、逐渐、突然三种形式呢？当然，对现实的研究应该注意：现实比理论更丰富；就是把飞跃的形式概括成三种，也不能包括现实中各种飞跃的一切特点。因此，绝不能以任何公式硬套。
    也有的同志认为武装斗争是社会制度的爆发飞跃的基本特征。由此断定我国新民主主义革命过程，从1925年北伐战争开始了飞跃（从五四运动起是它的量变准备阶段），这个飞跃是爆发性的，长期的，直到中华人民共和国成立才基本上完成。
    很多同志反对这种意见。他们认为，我国新民主主义革命过程的飞跃是从1947年开始的。其理由是，这时达到了一个转折点，即二十年来蒋介石王朝由发生发展到消灭的转折点，是我国人民将革命的车轮推向胜利、将反革命的车轮扭转使之走向复灭的转折点。正是从这个转折点开始，革命形势、中国社会发生了根本的变化。但由于中国的历史特点，在量变阶段有它自己的特殊性，即：有一连串的小的局部的爆发式飞跃。一个革命根据地的建立，从局部说来就是一个爆发式的飞跃；但从全局看来还是量变而不是质变。因为整个革命形势、中国半封建半殖民地的社会性质没有根本变化；我们的工作路线，还是在农村长期积蓄力量、以农村包围城市，准备夺取全国胜利，而不是把力量投入决战。作者就是持这种意见的，认为前一种意见说不通，一个事物的质变不能比它的量变阶段还长；而且与我党长期以农村包围城市、从夺取一个阵地到另一个阵地、最后夺取全国胜利的道路是不符合的。
    关于否定的否定规律
    （七）螺旋型的上升运动是不是否定的否定规律的基本内容？
    斯大林的“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”的小册子发表后，苏联哲学界一般认为否定的否定不是辩证法的基本规律之一；并认为否定的否定是黑格尔的术语，斯大林把它抛弃，将其积极内容概括在辩证法的第二和第三个基本特征中了。我国哲学界，也大都持这种观点。近两年来，苏联哲学界对这种观点进行了批判。现在似乎没有人否认否定的否定是辩证法的一个基本规律了。争论转到了螺旋型的上升运动（即在更高基础上重复已经阶段的某些特征）是不是否定的否定规律的基本内容。
    有些同志认为不是。螺旋型的上升运动、第三阶段在更高基础重复第一阶段的某些特征，只是某些现象如此，并不是普遍的。例如从原始社会到奴隶社会、再到封建社会，封建社会重复原始社会的那些特征呢？奴隶社会到封建社会再到资本主义社会，资本主义社会重复奴隶社会的那些特征呢？（这样例子有许多）因此，这个规律只是否定再否定，或表述为：“否定的否定的否定……”，或即称为否定的规律。
    有些同志反对这种意见。认为螺旋型的上升运动、第三阶段在更高基础上重复第一阶段的某些特征，是这一规律的基本内容。事物发展的全过程是正、反、合三阶段。恩格斯和列宁都是这样表述这个规律的。问题是必须从全部过程中才能看到否定之否定。例如前面举的例子，全过程应是：“原始社会→阶级社会（奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会）→共产主义社会”；而不是原始社会→奴隶社会→封建社会……”。而从阶级社会的全过程看来也是三段式的，资本主义会在更高的基础上重复奴隶社会的某些特征，即：直接生产者与生产资料的脱离。持这种意见的同志认为，否定的否定规律不仅教导人们去批判地接受文化遗产，而且是认识客观事物的曲折发展和彻底粉碎循环论的武器。
    苏联“共产党人”杂志去年第十三期发表的勃·凯德洛夫的“否定的否定规律”（译文载“学习译丛”1956年第十一期），是值得重视的一篇文章。作者提出了一个重要的论点——否定的否定规律发生作用的特点。他指出这一规律带有综合性和总结性，这一规律带有“积分的”性质，而带有较少的“微分”性质。“作为一切发展的必要环节的每一个否定，都具有‘微分的’性质。因为，在发展的每一时刻，总有某种东西被否定，被克服，同时，总有某种东西被肯定下来，并代替被否定、被克服的东西。‘否定的否定’规律的‘积分’性质说明，为什么它的作用和对立面的统一和‘斗争’的规律的作用不同，不是表现在任何地方，而仅仅表现在这样的地方：在这里，发展完成了一定的周期之后，在高级阶段上重复着已往阶段的某些特点和特征。”因此，“要了解这一规律的作用，只考察发展过程的某一个别阶段是不够的，而考察发展的某一个别时刻，则是更加不够的。要揭示这一规律的作用，就必须考察整个发展过程，把这一过程的各个阶段加以比较”。
    我国哲学界对否定的否定这一规律的研究还很不够。持第二种意见的同志，其论据大都是恩格斯在“反杜林论”中举过的例子，还不能彻底驳倒第一种意见。现在亟须从历史中、现实生活中、自然现象中探讨否定的否定规律，特别是这一规律发生作用的特点；研究否定的否定规律应用于认识过程的意义，以及否定的否定规律和黑格尔的三段式的根本区别。
