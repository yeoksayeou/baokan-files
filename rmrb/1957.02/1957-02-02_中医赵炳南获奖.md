Xinhua News Agency Report:
    Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhao Bingnan received a special award at the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau's 1956 year-end awards ceremony.
    Zhao Bingnan has practiced medicine in Beijing for nearly forty years and has rich clinical experience in treating skin diseases. He is particularly skilled in treating stubborn tinea and eczema. The efficacy of treatment for stubborn tinea is over 80%; the efficacy for stubborn eczema is almost 100%. He is currently a TCM consultant at the Beijing Municipal TCM Hospital and the Central Institute of Dermatology and Venereology, and also serves as a special physician at Beijing Hospital and Heping Hospital.
    Recently, Zhao Bingnan successfully treated three strange illnesses in an agency in Beijing. These three people suffered from three strange and very stubborn skin diseases. One person suddenly lost a large patch of hair on the upper part of their left ear, and the scalp turned white; another suffered from systemic stubborn eczema, with unbearable itching day and night; and the third had a palm-sized black patch on their face. These three people had been treated by many doctors without success. Last year, they were successively treated by Zhao Bingnan, and the first two have basically recovered, while the latter's condition has also shown significant improvement.
    For decades, Zhao Bingnan has been diligently studying classical works on surgery in traditional Chinese medicine. After his busy work, he has never given up his research on "Surgical Golden Mirror" and "Surgical Orthodox Lineage." Zhao Bingnan is currently working on sorting out records of skin diseases in traditional Chinese surgical literature, preparing to cooperate with Western medicine, and combining his own clinical experience to compile a textbook on TCM dermatology.

    中医赵炳南获奖
    据新华社讯　著名中医赵炳南在北京市公共卫生局1956年年终发奖大会上获得特等奖。
    赵炳南在北京行医近四十年，在治疗皮肤病上有丰富的临床经验。他更擅长顽癣、顽湿疡一类病症的治疗。顽癣疗效在80％以上；顽湿疡的疗效几乎达百分之百。现在他是北京市中医医院、中央皮肤性病研究所的中医顾问，并担任北京医院、和平医院的特邀医师。
    赵炳南在最近医治北京市一个机关的三种怪病，取得了很大成功。这三个人患着三种令人奇怪而又非常顽固难治的皮肤病。一个人在左耳上部突然脱掉一大片头发，头皮发白；另一个患全身顽湿疡，日夜奇痒难当；还有一个脸上呈现出巴掌大的一块黑色。这三个人经过许多医生的治疗，都未见效。去年他们先后经赵炳南诊疗，前两个的病已基本痊愈，后者的病也有显著疗效。
    赵炳南数十年来，都在刻苦钻研祖国医学中关于外科的经典著作。他在繁忙的工作之后，从未放弃过对“外科金鉴”、“外科正宗”的研究。目前赵炳南正着手整理中医外科文献中有关皮肤病的记载，准备和西医合作，结合自己的临床经验，编著中医皮肤病学。
