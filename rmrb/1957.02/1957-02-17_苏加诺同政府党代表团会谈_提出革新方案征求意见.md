Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 16th. President Sukarno held a meeting with a delegation jointly sent by five government parties at his villa in Bogor on the evening of the 15th. The meeting lasted from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM. All government parties sent their most important leaders to attend the meeting.

The spokesperson for the government party delegation, Leimena (Christian Party), said after the meeting that the President had presented his reform plan to them during the meeting. The President believes that neither partial nor comprehensive reorganization of the cabinet is sufficient to overcome the current difficulties. According to Leimena, the President said that his plan is to introduce a "new type of government" to Indonesia.

Leimena said that the government parties had expressed their respective positions to the President during the meeting regarding the issue of reorganizing the current cabinet. Some demanded a partial reorganization of the current cabinet, while others demanded a comprehensive reorganization, including replacing the Prime Minister.

After President Sukarno announced the full content of his reform plan to the government parties, he asked the parties to consider it carefully. Leimena said that the President hopes that the government parties will accept his plan. The government parties did not express their opinions on this plan during the meeting. They will meet with the President again and express their opinions after the plan is announced. Leimena said that the plan will be officially announced on February 21st.

"People's Daily" said that starting next week, the President will formally present his plan to the parliamentary groups of opposition parties such as the Masjumi Party and the Communist Party.

Some political parties have already begun discussing the government's plan today.

    新华社雅加达16日电　苏加诺总统15日晚上在茂物的别墅同包括五个政府党共同派出的代表团举行了会谈。会谈从晚上七时进行到十一时。各政府党都派了最重要的领袖来参加这次会谈。
    政府党代表团发言人来梅纳（基督教党）在会后说，总统在会谈中已经向他们提出了他的革新方案。总统认为不论局部的或者全面的改组内阁，都不足以克服当前的困难。据来梅纳说，总统说他的方案是要为印度尼西亚介绍一个“新型的政府”。
    来梅纳说，各政府党在会谈中已经就现内阁的改组问题向总统表示了他们各自的立场，其中有的要求局部改组现内阁，有的要求全面改组，包括调换内阁总理。
    苏加诺总统向各政府党宣布了他的革新方案的全部内容以后，要各政党加以慎重考虑。来梅纳说，总统希望各政府党能够接受他的方案。政府党在会谈时没有针对这个方案表示意见，它们将在方案公布以后再去见总统并且表示意见。来梅纳说，这个方案将在2月21日正式公布。
      “人民日报”说，从下星期一起，总统将分别向马斯友美党、共产党等在野党派的国会党团正式提出他的方案。
    有些政党今天已经开始讨论政府的方案。
