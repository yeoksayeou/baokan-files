At the distribution meeting of the Chaoyang Agricultural Cooperative in Suihua County, when the cooperative director announced the name of Park Bing-shun, everyone turned to look at her with admiration. Her ruddy and sturdy face still shone with the glow of a year's labor. This Korean woman's labor over the past year totaled 183 workdays, and she should receive 640 yuan.

Park Bing-shun is 41 years old this year, the mother of four children, but at first glance, she looks like a woman in her thirties. She works hard and is a good mother. Her husband passed away in the winter before last. The four children were still young, the oldest being only fourteen years old, and they faced difficulties in life. At that time, it was the high tide of cooperativization, and she sent her two hectares of land, a cart, and a cow into the newly established advanced cooperative.

After joining the cooperative, she saw that everyone was very friendly, working as if they were at their own home, so she worked hard from dawn till dusk. During the harvest, she got up at two o'clock every day, first making the meal, then taking care of the housework before rushing to the fields. At noon, she rushed home to cook for the children. In the evening, she had to take care of her big fat pig, four chickens, and a four-tenths acre vegetable garden. She never missed work. During the forty days of the autumn harvest and threshing, she didn't rest for a single day, but her housework was still arranged in an orderly manner.

Although this mother is very busy, her children have never worn dirty clothes. Sometimes, while it's still dark, the cooperative members would see her go to the paddy fields early to wash clothes for her children. Someone asked her if she was tired, and she said, "I feel uncomfortable if my hands are idle."

She is very good at managing her life. The cooperative pre-lends her 200 kilograms of rice every month, but she is reluctant to eat it all at once, so she exchanges part of the rice for millet and corn to eat together. She manages her home diligently. Before this distribution, she already had 400 yuan in savings in the bank, preparing to use it for her children's schooling in the future.

    勤恳的妈妈
    新华社记者　王懋昌
    在绥化县朝阳农业社的分配大会上，当社主任念到朴炳顺的名字时，大家都扭过头来带着敬慕的眼光看着她，她红润结实的脸上还闪着一年来劳动后的光泽。这位朝鲜族妇女在去年一年的劳动折合共达一百八十三个劳动日，应分得六百四十元。
    朴炳顺今年四十一岁了，是四个孩子的妈妈，可是乍看却像是三十岁左右的妇女。她劳动得好，又是一个好妈妈。前年冬天，她丈夫去世，四个孩子都还小，最大的才十四岁，生活面临着困难。当时正是合作化高潮时期，她就把两垧地、一辆车、一头牛送进了新成立的高级社。
    入社后她看到大家都很亲热，跟在自己家里干活一样，因此她也起早贪黑的干。收割时她每天两点钟就起床，先把饭做好，然后料理一下家务就往地里跑，中午又赶回家给孩子们做饭。晚上还要张罗她养的一口大肥猪、四只鸡、四分菜园子。她没有耽误过出工，在秋收打场的四十天里，她没有休息过一天，可是家务照样是安排得井井有条的。
    这位妈妈尽管很忙，她的孩子却没有穿过脏衣服。有时天还黑糊糊的，社员们就看见她提前到水田里给孩子们洗衣服。有人问她累不累，她说：“手闲下来心里也不舒服。”
    过日子她很会打算。每月社里预借给她二百斤大米，她舍不得一下子都吃掉，就将一部分大米换成小米和苞米杂着吃。她勤恳理家，这次分配前她已经在银行里存有四百元存款，准备将来给孩子们上学用。
