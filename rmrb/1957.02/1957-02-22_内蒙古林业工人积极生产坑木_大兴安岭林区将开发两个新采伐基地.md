Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, 21st—Before early February this year, Inner Mongolia's forestry industry transported more than 70,000 cubic meters of pit props to thirteen important coal mines in North and Northeast China. These pit props are enough to mine more than 4.4 million tons of raw coal.

Since the new year, Inner Mongolia's forestry industry workers have made it their important task to actively produce pit props to support coal mine production. According to statistics from the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Bureau, the entire bureau completed 117% of its pit prop sales plan in January.

Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, 21st—The Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Bureau is actively preparing to develop two new timber logging bases in the Ganhe and Saqiji areas of the Da Hinggan Ling forest area. Thirteen logging yards can be built in these two areas, with an annual output of nearly one million cubic meters of timber. Next year, four logging yards will be put into production first.

According to surveys by the forest survey team, the timber reserves in the Ganhe and Saqiji forest areas amount to more than 42 million cubic meters, and more than 90% of the trees are larches, which are widely used.

    内蒙古林业工人积极生产坑木
    大兴安岭林区将开发两个新采伐基地
    据新华社牙克石21日电　内蒙古森林工业在今年2月上旬以前，向华北、东北等地区的十三个重要煤矿运去了七万多立方公尺坑木。这些坑木能够开采四百多万吨原煤。
    内蒙古森林工业职工从新年以来，就把积极生产坑木支援煤矿生产作为自己的重要任务。据内蒙古森林工业管理局统计，在1月份内全局完成了坑木销售计划117％。
    据新华社牙克石21日电　内蒙古森林工业管理局积极准备在大兴安岭林区的甘河和萨其基开发两个新的木材采伐基地。这两个地区可以建成十三个伐木场，每年能采伐出近一百万立方公尺的木材。明年，将有四个伐木场首先投入生产。
    根据森林调查队的勘测，甘河和萨其基两个林区的木材蓄积量达四千二百多万立方公尺，90％以上的树木都是用途很广的落叶松。
