Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an - Over 95% of the arable land in Gaoling County, Shaanxi Province, now enjoys the convenience of irrigation. This is one of the great achievements of Gaoling County since the realization of agricultural cooperation last year.

Before cooperation, only over 200,000 mu of farmland in Gaoling County could be irrigated, and more than 100,000 mu of land was considered to be unchangeable dry land. With the advent of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the Gaoling County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated a plan to build water conservancy projects and mobilized the masses to launch a water conservancy construction campaign. Last spring alone, more than 452 canals, totaling more than 80,000 zhang in length, were built in the county, turning more than 28,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land, and more than 1,000 water wells were dug in the Jinghe River area, changing more than 12,400 mu of dry land. The so-called Baimang Plain, which runs across the north bank of the Jing and Wei Rivers, although a large canal passed in front of it, was always considered a dream to draw water to the plain because it was more than one zhang and five chi higher than the canal. Last year, thanks to the joint efforts of all the farmers in the county, under the guidance of the local water conservancy department, large-scale water conservancy projects were built, so that more than 75% of the more than 40,000 mu of land on the Baimang Plain was irrigated.

After the arable land in Gaoling County was provided with convenient irrigation, a bumper harvest of crops was achieved last year. The average yield of more than 140,000 mu of wheat in the county increased from more than 250 jin in 1955 to 330 jin, setting the highest record in local history; the county's 150,000 mu of cotton yielded an average of 77 jin of ginned cotton per mu; and corn also increased from an average of more than 220 jin per mu in 1955 to more than 280 jin.

    高陵县合作化的巨大成果之一
    95％以上的农田得到灌溉
    据新华社西安电　陕西省高陵县95％以上的耕地都得到了灌溉的便利。这是高陵县去年实现农业合作化以后的巨大成果之一。
    高陵县在合作化以前，全县可灌溉的耕地只有二十多万亩，有十多万亩土地被认为是无法改变的旱地。随着农业合作化高潮的到来，中共高陵县委作出兴修水利的规划，发动群众展开兴修水利运动。只去年春天，县内就修筑了长达八万多丈的四百五十二条渠道，使两万八千多亩旱地变成水地，在泾河南打了一千多眼水井，改变了一万二千四百多亩旱地。横贯在泾、渭河北岸的所谓白蟒原，虽然大渠从前面经过，但是因为高出渠道一丈五尺多，要引水上原，一向被认为是梦想。去年由于全县农民联合起来，在当地水利部门指导下，兴修庞大的水利工程，从而使白蟒原上的四万多亩土地中也有75％以上得到灌溉。
    高陵县的耕地得到灌溉便利以后，去年农作物获得了大丰收。全县的十四万多亩小麦平均产量由1955年的二百五十多斤提高到三百三十斤，出现当地历史上的最高纪录；全县十五万亩棉花每亩平均收到七十七斤皮棉；玉米也从1955年平均每亩产二百二十多斤提高到二百八十多斤。
