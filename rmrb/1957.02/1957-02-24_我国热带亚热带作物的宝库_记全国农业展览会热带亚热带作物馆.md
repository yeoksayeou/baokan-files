The Treasure Trove of Tropical and Subtropical Crops in Our Country
——A Visit to the Tropical and Subtropical Crop Pavilion at the National Agricultural Exhibition
By our reporter Chen Yichao

	Passing through the Crop Pavilion I at the National Agricultural Exhibition, filled with scenes of abundant harvests, one arrives at the Tropical and Subtropical Crop Pavilion, brimming with southern charm. People from the North China Plain can see here precious plants they have never encountered before.

	The tropical and subtropical terrain model indicates that China’s tropical and subtropical area covers approximately 500,000 square kilometers, accounting for 5% of the country's total area. This area is home to over one hundred kinds of tropical and subtropical crops, making it a treasure trove for our nation.

	The most captivating part here is the section displaying the development of China’s rubber industry. From the charts on display, one can see the exciting pace at which our rubber industry has developed in recent years. Taking the yield per rubber tree as an example, the output in 1955 more than doubled compared to 1952. The Hainan Island State-owned Xilian Farm's excellent rubber mother trees have achieved an annual yield of 27 kilograms of dry rubber sheets per tree, reaching the level of international standards for superior rubber trees. In terms of rubber quality, China is now no less competitive than well-known rubber-producing countries like Indonesia, Ceylon, and Malaya, and in some aspects, we have surpassed them. Surgical gloves made of thin-film rubber used to be produced with imported latex. Now, we can manufacture the raw materials for this thin-film rubber product ourselves. Rubber is an indispensable material for China’s industrial and national defense construction, prized for its good elasticity, strong tensile strength, resistance to acids, alkalis, and abrasion, and high-voltage tolerance, making it extremely versatile. The newly established state-owned farm's rubber plantations will have trees ready for tapping in just two to three years.

	Coconuts are another exhibit that sparks interest. People sometimes see on the screen how people on Hainan Island, when thirsty, climb a tall tree, pluck a watermelon-like fruit, poke a hole in it, and drink from it with great relish. Everyone knows this is a coconut. Here, visitors not only see it but also coconut jam and coconut oil made from coconut meat (coconut oil can be eaten or used to make margarine, and it is also a raw material for high-grade soaps and lubricating oils). There are also rice scoops made from the hard shell of the coconut and finely carved teapots and vases – these handicrafts are varnished and are as beautiful as the renowned bodiless lacquerware. The gifts from members of the Haikou City Special Handicraft Production Cooperative in Hainan Island to Chairman Mao are the most delightful and elaborate creations in this exhibition hall. These gifts are coconut shell-carved ashtrays and lunchboxes. The exhibits tell us that the coconut tree "has no waste parts," and its uses are vast. Coir can be made into nautical ropes and everyday brooms and brushes. Its leaves can be used to build houses and weave mats. The coconut trunk is excellent timber for bridges and other construction. Coconut roots can be used as medicinal materials. Coconuts are also plants that require little investment and yield high returns. A coconut tree blossoms and bears fruit six to seven years after planting and can be harvested continuously for seventy to one hundred years. The average annual investment is only a little over two jiao, but it can generate about ten yuan in income.

	The oil palm, known as the "King of Oils," is a tropical oil crop with extremely high oil yield in our country. One mu of oil palm can yield 250 jin of oil, which is five to ten times higher than the oil yield of one mu of peanuts or soybeans. It is also an important raw material for industry, and can be used to make lubricating oil, rust inhibitors for galvanized iron sheets, and fuel for internal combustion engines, etc.

	Here, one can also see coffee trees bearing cherry-like red fruits. When coffee is mentioned, people easily think it is a foreign product. In fact, China has been cultivating coffee trees for over seventy years, and many southern provinces have planted this tree, which can yield about one hundred jin of coffee beans per mu. According to statistics, exporting one thousand dan of coffee beans can be exchanged for eighteen tractors or ten trucks. Here, one can also see cocoa, which contains rich fat and protein, can be made into chocolate candies, and has a refreshing effect. The famous seasoning spice, pepper (with an annual output value of 1,500 to 2,000 yuan per mu), has also been successfully trial-planted in southern China.

	Walking into this exhibition hall, one can immediately see sisal hemp with flowering stems that are more than one zhang tall and leaves that grow in clusters like bundles of swords. This is a type of tropical bast fiber plant with extremely high yield and excellent quality. Its fiber is an important raw material for national defense and the textile industry and can be made into nautical ropes, linen fabrics, sacks, photographic paper, and currency paper, etc. Its disadvantage is that the seeds are too small, and the propagation rate is low. Workers at the State-owned Honghua Farm have created a rapid propagation method for stolons, which increases seedling propagation rate several times compared to the past, completing four years of propagation tasks in one year. Other tropical bast fiber crops include kenaf, ramie, as well as other hard fibers belonging to the Agavaceae family and abaca.

	The exhibits also include aromatic plants used to manufacture spices, such as citronella, patchouli, star anise, and lemon eucalyptus. Citronella is the most important raw material for manufacturing perfume. Now, the quality of citronella oil and fengmao oil made from citronella in our country has reached international standards. A productive mu of citronella grass in the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm on Hainan Island yielded 10,000 jin, and the citronella oil produced from this mu of citronella is worth more than 2,000 yuan.

	Medicinal raw materials such as coca, cinchona, cassia, betel nut, and amomum villosum can also be seen in this exhibition hall. The cassia production in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of our country accounts for the first place in the world. Except for a small amount produced by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, other countries produce very little. Our country can produce 160,000 dan of cassia bark and 400 dan of cassia oil annually.

	From the charts in the exhibition, people can learn that among the dozens of tropical and subtropical plants on display, most of them, except for cassia and star anise, were introduced from the tropical regions of Southeast Asia by overseas Chinese. In recent years, overseas Chinese have actively responded to the motherland’s call, and more than two thousand skilled technicians with experience in cultivating tropical plants have joined state-owned farms. Many overseas Chinese have also invested in establishing farms to grow tropical crops. Overseas Chinese have made significant contributions to the development of tropical and subtropical crops in their motherland.

	The exhibits also tell us how enthusiastic the Li, Miao, Yao, Dai, Yi, Zhuang, and other ethnic minorities residing in China’s tropical and subtropical regions are in developing the country's tropical plant resources. The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture plans to plant more than 400,000 mu of tropical crops such as rubber and sisal hemp this year. The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province planted 80,000 mu of coffee last year, and plans to plant more than 100,000 mu of coffee this year.

	Tropical and subtropical areas are a treasure trove for our country, and we should develop them better. (Attached picture)

    我国热带亚热带作物的宝库
    ——记全国农业展览会热带亚热带作物馆
    本报记者　陈一超
    穿过全国农业展览会上一片五谷丰收景象的农作物一馆，就来到了充满南国风味的热带亚热带作物馆。生长在华北平原上的人们，在这里可以看到他们从未见过的珍贵植物。
    热带亚热带地形模型表明：我国热带亚热带的面积约有五十万平方公里，占全国总面积5％，这里有一百多种热带亚热带作物，是我国的一个宝库。
    这里最吸引人的，要算显示我国三叶橡胶发展的那一部分了。从展览的图表中，可以知道我国的橡胶事业这几年发展的速度，非常令人兴奋。仅以每株橡胶树的产量计算，1955年就比1952年提高了一倍多。海南岛国营西联农场优良橡胶母树，每株的年产量（产干胶片二十七公斤）已达到国际优良橡胶树的每株年产量的水平。从橡胶的质量上看，目前我国已较世界著名橡胶产地的印度尼西亚、锡兰、马来亚等国家毫无逊色，有些已经超过了它们。医疗上用的薄膜橡胶的手术手套，过去都是用进口的胶乳作原料，现在制造这种薄膜橡胶成品的原料，我们已经能够制造了。三叶橡胶是我国工业和国防建设不可缺少的物资，它的弹性好、拉力强、又耐酸、耐碱、耐磨擦、耐高电压，用途非常广。我国新建立的国营农场的橡胶，园再过两三年，有的橡胶树就可以开始割胶了。
    椰子也是使人感到兴趣的展品之一。人们在银幕上有时候可以看到海南岛的人们在口渴了的时候，爬上一株高树，摘下一个像西瓜一样的东西，戳开一个洞口，双手捧到嘴边，喝得是那样的香甜。大家都知道这就是椰子。观众们不仅在这里看到了它，而且还看到用椰子肉做的果酱和榨成的椰油（椰油可以食用，还可以用椰油制成人造牛油，是高级肥皂和滑机油等的原料）。这里还有用椰肉外面的硬壳做成的饭杓和雕有花纹的精细的茶壶、花瓶等手工艺品——这些手工艺品上了漆，就和著名的脱胎漆器一样美观。海南岛海口市特种手工艺生产合作社的社员们送给毛主席的礼物，是这个展览馆里最使人欢喜的精心制作，这些礼物就是用椰壳雕刻的烟灰盒和饭盒。展览品告诉我们，椰子树“全身无废物”，它的用途大的很。椰棕可以制成航海用的缆绳和日常用的棕扫帚、棕刷等，它的叶子可以盖房子、编织席子，椰树干是很好的桥梁和其它建筑上用的木材，椰根可以做药材。椰子又是一种花钱少收益大的植物。一棵椰子树种植六七年以后就开花结果，可以一连收获七十至一百年之久；平均每年只须投资二角多，就可以有十元左右的收益。
    有“世界油王”之称的油棕，是我国产油量极高的热带油料作物，一亩油棕的产量可榨油二百五十斤，它比一亩花生或大豆的出油量高五倍到十倍。它也是工业上的重要原料之一，可以做润滑油以及锌铁皮防锈剂和内燃机的燃料等。
    在这里还可以看到结着像樱桃一样的红果实的咖啡树。提起咖啡来，人们很容易认为它是外国产品；实际上，我国培植咖啡树已有七十多年的历史，南方许多省都种植了这种树，每亩可产到一百斤左右咖啡豆。据统计，出口一千担咖啡豆，便可以换回十八台拖拉机或十辆载重汽车。在这里还可以看到，含有丰富脂肪和蛋白质的、可以做巧克力糖、有提神的功效的可可，著名的调味香料胡椒（一亩地一年的产值一千五百元到两千元），在我国南方也试种成功了。
    走进这个展览馆，一眼就可以看到开花的茎长得有一丈多高的剑麻，丛生的叶子像一把一把的宝剑。这是产量极高、品质优良的热带麻类纤维植物的一种，它的纤维是国防工业和纺织工业的重要原料，可以制成航海用的绳缆、麻质布料、麻袋、照像用的感光纸和货币纸等。它的缺点是结实太小，繁殖率低。国营红华农场的工人已经创造出走茎快速繁殖法，比过去提高种苗繁殖率几倍，一年可以完成四年的繁殖任务。热带麻类纤维作物中还有番麻、假菠萝麻以及其他属于龙舌兰科的硬质麻类和蕉麻。
    在展品中还有制造香料的芳香植物，如香茅、广藿香、八角、柠檬桉等。香茅是制造香精最重要的原料；现在我国用香茅制成香茅油和风茅油的质量已达到国际水平。海南岛兴隆华侨农场的一亩丰产地收获了一万斤香茅草，这一亩香茅出产的香茅油价值二千多元。
    用作医药原料的古柯、金鸡纳、玉桂、槟榔、砂仁等热带植物，在这个展览馆里也可以看到。我国广东、广西两省出产的玉桂产量，占全世界第一位。除了越南民主共和国有少量的出产外，其他各国很少出产。我国每年可产桂皮十六万担，桂油四百担。
    从展览图表中，人们可以了解到：在展出的这几十种热带亚热带植物中，除了玉桂、八角等以外，绝大部分都是华侨从南洋热带地区引进的。近几年来，华侨积极响应祖国的号召，已经有二千多名有栽培热带植物经验的熟练技术人员，参加了国营农场工作；还有许多华侨投资建立种植热带作物农场。在发展祖国热带亚热带作物方面，华侨对祖国作了重大的贡献。
    展出的图表还告诉我们：聚居在我国热带亚热带地区的黎、苗、徭、傣、彝、僮等兄弟民族，在开发祖国热带植物资源方面的热情是多么高。海南岛黎族苗族自治州，计划今年种植四十多万亩橡胶、剑麻等热带作物；云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州，去年种植了八万亩咖啡，今年还要再种咖啡十多万亩。
    热带亚热带地区是我国的一块宝地，我们应该更好地开发它。（附图片）
