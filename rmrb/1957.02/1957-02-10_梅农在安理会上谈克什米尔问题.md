Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th: Indian representative Menon reiterated India's position while continuing the debate on the Kashmir issue at the United Nations Security Council on the 8th, saying, "Kashmir is an indivisible part of India. According to law and according to the wishes of the people that we have been able to investigate, it should become a part of India."

Menon, in referring to the five-nation proposal of the United States, Britain, Australia, and others regarding the Kashmir issue adopted by the Security Council on January 24, said that the five-nation proposal only repeated previous resolutions without taking into account the changes that have occurred in the Kashmir issue over the years. He said that these changes should now be considered.

Menon said, "We agreed to hold a plebiscite when the Pakistani army withdrew from Kashmir. But they are still there."

Menon finally said that we are ready for discussions, and we are ready to find solutions. I believe Pakistan can reach an agreement with us on this basis.

The Security Council will continue its meeting next week.

    梅农在安理会上  谈克什米尔问题
    据新华社9日讯　纽约消息：印度代表梅农8日在联合国安全理事会继续辩论克什米尔问题时重申印度的立场说，“克什米尔是印度的不可分割的一部分。它根据法律和根据我们所能调查的人民的愿望，都应当成为印度的一部分。”
    梅农在谈到安理会1月24日通过的美、英、澳等五个国家关于克什米尔问题的一个提案时说，五国提案只是重复了以前的决议，而没有考虑到几年以来克什米尔问题发生的变化。他说，现在应该考虑这些变化。
    梅农说，“我们同意在巴基斯坦陆军撤出克什米尔的时候举行一次公民投票。但是他们仍然在那儿。”
    梅农最后说，我们准备进行讨论，我们准备寻找解决办法。我相信巴基斯坦能够和我们在这个基础上达成协议。
    安理会将在下星期继续开会。
