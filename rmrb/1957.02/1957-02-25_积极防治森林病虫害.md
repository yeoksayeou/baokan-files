Actively Prevent and Control Forest Diseases and Pests
Wang Xintian, Deputy Director of the Forest Management Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry

Actively preventing and controlling forest diseases and insect pests, and ensuring the healthy growth of trees, is an important measure to increase forest output per unit area. Spring is the season when forest diseases and insect pests occur and spread. Preventing and controlling forest diseases and insect pests is now an urgent task.

This year, there are many more favorable conditions for preventing and controlling forest diseases and insect pests than in the past: the entire rural area of the country has been cooperativized, which facilitates unified leadership of the prevention and control work; more than 900 forest management stations, more than 400 forest farms, and more than 2,100 forestry work stations have been established throughout the country; and provinces such as Fujian, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang have established specialized pest control agencies, so this work is being done by dedicated personnel. However, there are still many difficulties in preventing and controlling forest diseases and insect pests. First, the leaders in many areas have not yet placed this work on their work agenda; the planning, funding, and preparation of medicines and equipment for the prevention and control of forest diseases and insect pests within cooperatives are also poor, and the issue of work point recording has not been reasonably resolved; there is also a severe shortage of grassroots organizations and technical personnel for the prevention and control of forest diseases and insect pests. These favorable conditions should be fully utilized to overcome these difficulties.

In the future, we must earnestly implement the principle of "prevention is more important than cure" in conjunction with forest management, felling management, and afforestation techniques. For example, planting mixed forests of coniferous trees to prevent pine caterpillar damage; in felling management, strictly implement the "Trial Regulations for Clearing Forest Areas in State-owned Forests," and ensure that clearing is carried out immediately after felling, and logs are debarked, especially in forest areas severely affected by diseases and insect pests, which should be allocated to forest industry departments for felling as soon as possible, and the felled affected trees should be debarked immediately, and the bark and branches carrying insects should be burned on the spot; in management, actively promote sanitary felling work, which should be carried out first in closed-off forests and seed tree areas to reduce and prevent the occurrence and spread of forest diseases and insect pests. It is also necessary to protect beneficial birds, such as woodpeckers, orioles, white-cheeked tits, cuckoos, and shrikes, as well as cultivate and breed parasitic wasps and parasitic flies to eliminate pine caterpillars.

The prediction and forecasting of forest diseases and insect pests is very important. Pre-determining the areas where forest diseases and insect pests will occur, the time of occurrence, and the development trend is the basis for formulating prevention and control plans. With accurate prediction and forecasting, it is also necessary to grasp the favorable period for pest control, such as focusing on eliminating pine caterpillars before and after overwintering of larvae, and eliminating bamboo locusts during the second instar nymph stage. Some people still have a侥幸 [jiao xing, lucky] mentality towards the prevention and control of forest diseases and insect pests, and always wait until the diseases and insect pests are severe before taking control measures, which often leads to a passive situation, wasting effort and time, and causing significant losses.

Past experience has proven that 666 pesticide is effective in eliminating pine caterpillars and bamboo locusts, which is not only technically simple but also inexpensive. Therefore, it is requested that all localities make every effort to use medicines and equipment to control insect pests. It is hoped that the material supply departments will provide support. In some areas, the conditions for large-scale use of medicines and equipment for pest control are not yet available, so manual swatting should still be actively used to supplement the deficiencies of medicine and equipment control. Special attention should be paid to summarizing and promoting some of the advanced experiences of the masses in pest control.

Last year, Hunan Province proposed the principle of "active leadership, comprehensive implementation, treating both major and minor problems, and thorough elimination" in pest control work. The leadership grasped the work tightly, proposed a pest control plan in advance, and incorporated it into the agricultural production plan, with unified arrangements and unified inspections with emphasis, and this work was carried out relatively well. Hubei Province did not grasp this work tightly enough in the first half of last year, and the area of prevention and control only accounted for 2% of the area affected by insect pests. Furthermore, Xianyou County in Fujian Province feared that arranging pest control would hinder agricultural production, and as a result, the area affected by insect pests expanded from more than 25,000 mu to more than 80,000 mu. It can be seen how great the difference is depending on whether the leadership attaches importance to it or not!

    积极防治森林病虫害
    林业部森林经营局副局长　王心田
    积极防治森林病虫害，使树木健康地生长，是提高森林单位面积产量的一项重要措施。春季是森林病虫害发生和蔓延的季节。防治森林病虫害现在已经是一项迫切的工作了。
    今年防治森林病虫害比过去有很多有利的条件：全国农村已经合作化，这就便于统一领导防治工作；全国已经建立了九百多个森林经营所，四百多个林场和二千一百多个林业工作站；福建、湖北、江西、浙江等省建立了防治虫害的专业机构，这项工作有了专人负责来做。但是，防治森林病虫害工作，仍然有很多困难。首先是很多地区的领导人员还没有把这项工作摆到工作日程上来；防治森林病虫害在合作社内的计划、费用和药械准备工作做得也差，记工问题没有合理解决；基层机构、防治森林病虫的技术干部还很缺乏。应该充分利用有利条件来克服这些困难。
    今后必须结合森林经营、采伐管理和造林技术认真贯彻“防重于治”的方针。如在针叶树造混交林，预防松毛虫为害；在采伐管理上，严格执行国有林主伐试行规程中的清理林场工作，要做到随采随清理，原木剥皮，特别是被病虫危害严重的林区，应尽先拨交森林工业部门采伐，采伐的被害木要立即剥皮，带虫的树皮和枝条应该就地烧毁；在经营上，要积极推行卫生采伐工作，要尽先在禁伐林和母树林区进行，来减少和防止森林病虫害的发生和蔓延。还要保护益鸟，如啄木鸟、黄鹂、白脸山雀、杜鹃、伯劳等，以及培养和繁殖寄生蜂和寄生蝇来消灭松毛虫。
    森林病虫的预测预报工作十分重要。预先测定森林病虫害的发生地区，发生时期和发展的趋势，是制定防治计划的依据。有了正确的预测预报，还要掌握治虫的有利时期，如消灭松毛虫应着重在幼虫越冬前后，消灭竹蝗则宜于二龄跳蝻时期。有些人对于防治森林病虫害还有一种侥幸心理，总是等到病虫害严重了才去防治，以致经常陷于被动，费力费时，造成重大损失。
    历年的经验证明，六六六药剂消灭松毛虫和竹蝗的效果是良好的，这不仅技术简单而且价格便宜。因此要求各地尽力采用药械防治虫害。希望物资供应部门予以支持。某些地区目前大量使用药械治虫的条件尚不具备，仍应积极采用人工扑打的办法，辅助药械防治的不足。应特别注意总结和推广群众防治虫害的一些先进经验。
    湖南省去年在治虫工作中提出了“积极领导、全面开展、轻重并治、彻底消灭”的方针，领导方面抓得紧，事先提出防虫计划，并把它纳入农业生产计划，有重点地统一布置统一检查，这项工作就开展得比较好。湖北省去年上半年对这项工作抓得不够紧，防治面积仅占发生虫害面积的2％。又如福建仙游县怕布置防虫妨碍农业生产，结果，虫害面积由二万五千多亩扩大到八万多亩。可见领导重视与否，其结果有多大的差别！
