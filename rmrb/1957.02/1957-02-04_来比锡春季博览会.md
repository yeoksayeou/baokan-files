    Leipzig Spring Fair
    The Leipzig Fair, with a history of 700 years, is scheduled to hold its 1957 Spring Fair from March 3rd to 14th. This is the nineteenth Leipzig Fair since the end of World War II. This traditional fair was interrupted for several years during the war and resumed in 1946. Before 1951, it was held twice a year in spring and autumn, and then changed to once a year. Since 1955, it has been held twice a year again.
    In order to welcome the upcoming Spring Fair, the documentary film of the 1956 Leipzig Spring Fair has been screened in many countries. In our country, the Commercial Counselor of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China held a press conference in Beijing on January 23 and screened the documentary of the fair. The film introduced the magnificent scenery of Leipzig, this ancient trading center. Many buildings and halls that appear on the screen have been newly built in recent years, because the original buildings of the fair were almost completely destroyed during the war.
    This year's Spring Fair is a technical fair and a consumer goods sample fair. In twenty-two fair halls, sixteen fair buildings, seventeen pavilions and a wide open-air exhibition area, approximately 10,000 exhibitors from forty countries will exhibit the items they intend to sell, including aircraft industry products, which will be exhibited for the first time.
    As in the past, this fair will once again demonstrate the growing economic strength of socialist countries and contribute to promoting trade between them. The Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries will exhibit their complete export catalogs at the fair. Taking a prominent position in the technical exhibition are those products of the socialist countries that have the most favorable natural and technical conditions for expanding production based on economic cooperation plans. The Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia will participate in the exhibition with an official collective exhibition for the first time after the war.
    In the past, in addition to collective exhibitions, Polish and Czechoslovak foreign trade companies also selected representative export commodities to be exhibited in various classified exhibition halls, which played a beneficial role in transactions. At this year's fair, some other socialist countries will also adopt this method.
    The exhibition of complete sets of commodities from socialist countries will enable experts, engineers, scientists, production innovators, foreign trade personnel, and planning workers to understand the production of fraternal countries and exchange advanced experience in this place where technical achievements are concentrated.
    The Leipzig Fair also provides good conditions for promoting trade exchanges between countries with different economic and social systems. Therefore, it is a symbol of peaceful coexistence. Many countries and companies in Western Europe and overseas have participated in the fairs in the past few years. Among the seventeen countries participating in collective exhibitions at this Spring Fair, Denmark, Iceland, Greece, Turkey and Tunisia will also be included for the first time. Major companies in all industrial sectors in Western Europe, Northern Europe, the Near East and Latin America will once again come to the Leipzig Fair to exhibit their products.
    Almost all European countries will exhibit their most important exports at the Leipzig Fair. At this fair, West Germany will occupy the second largest exhibition area. (Nai)

    来比锡春季博览会
    具有七百年历史的来比锡博览会，预定在3月3日至14日举行1957年的春季博览会。这是第二次世界大战以后的第十九次来比锡博览会。这个传统的博览会在战时曾中断数年，1946年恢复。1951年以前每年分春秋两次举行，之后改为每年一次，1955年起又恢复一年举行两次。
    为了迎接即将举行的春季博览会，1956年来比锡春季博览会的纪录影片已在许多国家放映。在我国，德意志民主共和国驻华大使馆商务参赞曾于1月23日在北京举行记者招待会，并放映了博览会的纪录片。影片向人们介绍了来比锡这个古老的贸易中心的宏丽景色。在银幕上出现的许多大楼和大厅都是最近几年新建的，因为博览会原有的建筑物在战争期间几乎全部被毁。
    今年的春季博览会是一个技术博览会和日用品样品博览会。在二十二个博览厅、十六座博览大厦、十七个博览馆和宽广的露天展览场上，将有大约四十个国家的一万个展览者展出他们打算出售的物品，其中包括第一次参加展出的飞机工业产品。
    像过去一样，这次博览会将再一次显示出社会主义国家日益增长的经济力量，并为促进它们之间的贸易作出贡献。苏联和各人民民主国家将在博览会上展出它们成套的出口目录。在技术展出中占显著地位的，是各社会主义国家根据经济合作计划在扩大生产方面具备最有利的自然和技术条件的那些产品。南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国将是战后第一次以官方集体展出方式参加展览。
    过去，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易公司除了集体展出以外，还选择了具有代表性的出口商品在各个分类展览馆里展出，在交易上起了有益的作用。在今年的博览会上，另外有些社会主义国家也将采取这种方法。
    社会主义国家整套商品的展出，将使专家、工程师、科学家、生产革新者、对外贸易人员和计划工作者有可能在这个技术成就集中表现的场所互相了解兄弟国家的生产情况，交流先进经验。
    来比锡博览会也为沟通不同经济和社会制度国家之间的贸易往来提供良好的条件。因此，它是和平共处的一个象征。西欧和海外的许多国家和公司都参加了过去几年的博览会。在这次春季博览会上参加集体展出的十七个国家中，还将包括第一次参加集体展出的丹麦、冰岛、希腊、土耳其和突尼斯。西欧、北欧、近东和拉丁美洲一切工业部门的主要公司将再度到来比锡博览会展出它们的产品。
    几乎所有的欧洲国家都要在来比锡博览会上展出它们最主要的出口品。在这次博览会上，西德所占的展览面积将居第二位。　（乃）
