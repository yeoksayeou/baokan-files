Shaanxi Prepares Technical Force for Great Production

    (Reported by this newspaper) Shaanxi Province is preparing a large technical force for this year's agricultural production campaign in its spring plowing activities.

    Many places have conducted technical training among farmers. In one month, Fugu County trained more than 400 agricultural technicians, more than 270 soil and water conservationists, and more than 670 breeders from agricultural cooperatives. The Liangyi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Chaoyi County and the Liangyi Agricultural Technology Extension Station held a training class attended by more than 180 agricultural cooperative production directors, technical section chiefs, and technicians, summarizing last year's production experience and studying the cultivation techniques of local major crops. The Mujiaba Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Nanzheng County also specially trained technicians in spring potato planting, preparing to strive for a potato harvest to solve the food shortage problem in disaster areas.

    In some places, full-time agricultural technical cadres also underwent rectification and training before and after the Spring Festival. The Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experimental Station concentrated cadres from relevant agricultural technology extension stations in three phases to train them in cotton crop cultivation, plant protection, and food crop cultivation. Wubu, Fugu, and Mei Counties have all concentrated on training full-time agricultural technical cadres. After their studies, they were all full of confidence and expressed their determination to consolidate their achievements, overcome their shortcomings, and continue to promote agricultural technology reform this year.

    本报讯　陕西省各地在备耕活动中，为今年农业大生产运动准备了大量技术力量。
    许多地方在农民中进行了技术训练。府谷县在一个月中，训练了农业社农业技术员四百多名、水土保持员二百七十多名、饲养员六百七十名。中共朝邑县两宜区委会和两宜农业技术推广站，举办了有农业社生产主任、技术股长、技术员一百八十多人参加的训练班，总结了去年的生产经验，研究了当地主要作物的耕作技术。中共南郑县牟家坝乡支部，还专门训练了春播洋芋的技术人员，准备争取洋芋丰收，解决灾区缺粮问题。
    有些地方的农业技术专职干部，在春节前后也进行了整训。陕西省农业综合试验站，分三期集中有关农业技术推广站的干部，进行棉花作物栽培、植物保护、粮食作物栽培的训练。吴堡、府谷、郿县都集中训练了农业技术专职干部。他们经过学习以后，都满怀信心，表示要巩固成绩，克服缺点，在今年继续推行农业技术改革。
