Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 25th: Edmundson, a former US Information Agency official in South Korea, said in a television interview on the 24th that the reason the US government prohibits American journalists from visiting China is that it fears these journalists will discover, after arriving in China, that the American prisoners detained by the Chinese government "are indeed American intelligence agents." He specifically pointed out that Fecteau and Downey among the prisoners are intelligence agents of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Edmundson said that the US government fears that this "may weaken the US's reasons for seeking their release."

Edmundson, who criticized Eisenhower's Middle East policy as possibly leading the US to "cross the (war) brink and enter atomic war," was therefore dismissed from his post by the US government in January.

Edmundson said that when some of its personnel were arrested, the CIA portrayed them as innocent American businessmen or civilians, thus exploiting the emotions of the American people. This sentiment could "create tension and create the kind of national atmosphere that could lead a country to war."

He also accused the CIA of supporting the harassment activities of Chiang Kai-shek's remnant troops on the China-Myanmar border. He said that this is one of the CIA's "most notorious" actions and may be detrimental to US foreign policy or supreme interests.

Edmundson also said that US "aid" to South Korea "is just pouring money down a rat hole."

    前美国新闻署驻南朝鲜官员
    揭露美政府禁止记者访华原因
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：前美国新闻署驻南朝鲜官员埃德蒙逊24日在电视谈话中说，美国政府所以禁止美国记者访问中国，是因为它害怕这些记者到中国后会发现被中国政府拘禁的美国犯人“确实是美国谍报人员”，他特别指出犯人中的费克图和唐奈是美国中央情报局的谍报人员。埃德蒙逊说，美国政府担心这样“可能削弱美国争取释放他们的理由”。
    埃德蒙逊曾经批评艾森豪威尔的中东政策可能使美国“越过（战争）边缘，进入原子战争”，他因此而在1月间被美国政府解除了职务。
    埃德蒙逊说，中央情报局在它的若干人员被捕的时候，把他们说成是无辜的美国商人或者平民，这样就利用了美国人民的感情。这种情绪可以“引起紧张局势，造成那种可以把一个国家导向战争的全国性气氛。”
    他还指责中央情报局支持蒋介石残余部队在中缅边境的骚扰活动。他说，这是中央情报局“最罪恶昭彰的”行动之一，可能有害于美国的外交政策或者最高利益。
    埃德蒙逊还说，美国对南朝鲜的“援助”“只是把钱倒进老鼠洞里去”。
