Xinhua News Agency, Gyangtse, 26th - The Gyangtse Qekyi Level Office of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held banquets on the 24th to welcome the Dalai Lama and his entourage to Gyangtse.

　　The banquets were held separately at Pelkor Chode Monastery and the CPC Gyangtse Sub-Work Committee Club.

　　The Dalai Lama said at the banquet: "After coming to Gyangtse, I have seen many new things in Gyangtse, and the work here has made great achievements. I am very happy. Let us toast to our future joint efforts to do a good job in Tibet."

　　Sokang Wangqing Gele, a Kalon of the Tibetan local government, said at the banquet: "Many capitalist countries have expressed doubts about the Communist Party's policy of freedom of religious belief. The Dalai Lama's successful religious activities in India are a good proof of our country's policy of freedom of religious belief."

　　On the 24th, the Dalai Lama also received leading cadres of the CPC Gyangtse Sub-Work Committee and leaders of the Gyangtse Qekyi Level Office, as well as heads of various people's organizations.

    江孜基巧级办事处举行宴会欢迎达赖喇嘛
    新华社江孜26日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会江孜基巧级办事处24日分别举行宴会，欢迎达赖喇嘛和他的随行人员到达江孜。
    宴会分别在白居寺和中共江孜分工委俱乐部举行。
    达赖喇嘛在宴会上说：“来到江孜后，我看到了江孜许多新气象，这里的工作有很大的成绩，我很高兴。为我们今后共同努力作好西藏的工作而干杯。”
    西藏地方政府噶伦索康·旺清格勒在宴会上讲话说：“许多资本主义国家对于共产党的宗教信仰自由政策表示怀疑。达赖喇嘛此次到印度圆满地进行了各项宗教活动，对于我国宗教信仰自由政策是一个很好的证明。”
    24日，达赖喇嘛还接见了中共江孜分工委负责干部和江孜基巧级办事处领导人，各人民团体负责人等。并听取了江孜基巧级办事处主任定甲·多吉坚赞和副主任阴法唐关于江孜各项工作的汇报。
