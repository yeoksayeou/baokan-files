    "Choosing Him as the Director Was the Right Decision"
    By our reporters Zhang Jing and Yue E

    The sun quietly climbed over the head of Dongting East Mountain, and the morning mist still lingered on the mountainside, emitting a moist chill. An overnight frost had draped the earth in a silvery-white coat. Although it was the dead of winter, the large orange groves near Taihu Lake remained lush with dense foliage, and the rosy clouds reflected in the morning mist floated gently over the treetops. Below the mountain, thin shards of ice floated in the mirror-like fish ponds, as if the fish at the bottom were beginning to stir.

    Living at the foot of this mountain, by the water, in the rich and beautiful East Mountain area, are the more than two hundred households of the Qingfeng Advanced Flower, Fruit, and Fishery Cooperative in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province.

    We heard that this cooperative's production was the "top brand" in the whole county, and the cooperative director, Shen Fuxing, was a "terrific" good cadre. So, we arrived here on a cold morning.

    When we found the cooperative's office, we saw two people arguing, red-faced and thick-necked. The shorter, stockier person was questioning the thinner one: "Where did the three thousand catties of bean cake go?"

    A woman living nearby told us that the thin man was the cooperative director, Shen Fuxing.

    Strange! Why was the cooperative director, whom everyone praised, treating someone so roughly? Why did someone suspect him of corruption? Just as we were wondering, a cadre-like person came in with a string of keys in his hand. He was the cooperative's storekeeper, Shen Delong. We immediately asked him about the matter. Shen Delong said, "Our cooperative director is never the type to do things in secret; he is very down-to-earth in how he treats people and does things. But he won't stand for anyone falsely accusing him. If you don't believe me, look!" As he spoke, Shen Delong readily opened the door of the storeroom and led us inside. It turned out that the three thousand catties of bean cake were still locked inside, untouched.

    Coming out of the storeroom, Shen Delong continued to introduce the situation to us: Besides flowers and fruits, our cooperative's fishery is also a major production. The cooperative director had already planned to use most of the bean cake to develop fishery production. That cooperative member was mistaken. Comrades, you've probably seen the more than three hundred fish ponds at the foot of the front mountain, all of which belong to our cooperative. Last year, we also reclaimed 150 mu of wasteland to develop more fish ponds. The fish fry that go down in the spring, even if they're only an inch long, will be two catties each when they come up in the fall, which is much faster than growing fruit trees.

    That evening, we stayed at the cooperative. We gradually learned that the Qingfeng Cooperative was formed in the spring of 1956 by merging the Jinxing and Yingsheng elementary cooperatives. Shen Fuxing was serving as the director of the advanced cooperative for the first year. The cooperative members were satisfied that the "new director was wholeheartedly leading production, increasing everyone's income."

    When the Qingfeng Cooperative was established, it was a time of scarcity, and the cooperative was short of funds. Some poor peasant cooperative members were experiencing difficulties, and middle peasants took the opportunity to make trouble, all crowding around the cooperative demanding to borrow money. Shen Fuxing, having just become the cooperative director, didn't know how to handle it, so he went to the district for help, but the district had no money to lend either! Shen Fuxing had no choice but to return home. As soon as he stepped inside, people were sitting everywhere – on stools, beds, tables, footboards, even on the water tank lid and the stove. The middle peasant Jin Er even brought his three children and two piglets, wanting the cooperative director to raise them. As soon as they saw Shen Fuxing come in, they all swarmed around him. Shen Fuxing didn't say a word, but ran into the room and took out a pair of copper candlestick holders, a steel foot warmer, and the more than 150 yuan he had received in the elementary cooperative, placing them all on the table. He said to everyone:

    "The cooperative really has no money, and the district won't lend any. All I have at home are these valuables. Let's lend them to the cooperative members who are having the most difficulties to tide them over for a few days!" The money and belongings that Shen Fuxing took out were immediately lent to several of the poorest peasants, solving their production and livelihood problems. The middle peasants dared not make trouble anymore, and after Shen Fuxing had talked to him, Jin Er took his children back home. After finally getting Jin Er out of the way, Shen Fuxing's wife burst into tears and nagged and scolded for four days and four nights.

    Weighed down with worries, Shen Fuxing climbed to the top of East Mountain alone and sat down. He thought about how everyone had elected him as the cooperative director, but he had no solutions. How could he continue? Thinking of this, tears couldn't help but fall.

    The next day, he steeled himself and went to see the district chief again. The district chief looked at his red and swollen eyes and had a calm conversation with him: "Comrade Shen Fuxing, leading an advanced cooperative is already very difficult, and your difficulties are just beginning. What's important is to focus on production first. Isn't your cooperative blessed with mountains, water, flowers, fruits, and fish ponds, all sources of wealth? As long as you make good use of them and establish a foundation in production, so that every cooperative member increases their income by the end of the year, they might even praise you as a good director!" The district chief's words were like a cooling balm, banishing the troubles of the past few days.

    From then on, he devoted almost all his energy to production. On August 2nd, when the force 12 typhoon struck, the roaring wind shook the valleys for a whole day and night. Old loquat trees were uprooted and blown down, some almost completely torn out of the ground. On that night of wind and rain, Shen Fuxing did not go home. The cooperative cadres also braved the wind and rain to come to the cooperative's office. Everyone discussed ways to salvage the fruit trees after the typhoon. They anticipated the worst-case scenarios and came up with various rescue plans. As soon as the typhoon subsided slightly, everyone went to the various production teams to mobilize all the cooperative members to carry out the rescue. In just two days, all the more than two thousand uprooted fruit trees were rescued, and most of them survived well. Now, clusters of pale yellow loquat blossoms, set off by the broad loquat leaves, are blooming in the mountainside, and the fuzzy stamens are nurturing abundant fruits. The cooperative members said with emotion, "If it hadn't been for the rescue, these fruit trees would have been chopped up for firewood long ago."

    Because this area is near Taihu Lake, farmers have been raising fish for over two hundred years. Now, there are several households in the Qingfeng Cooperative who are skilled in raising fish for generations. But "every year they raised fish, it was never as good as the previous year. Last year, the first year of the advanced cooperative, the whole cooperative produced more than 229,000 catties of fish, an increase of 78% compared to 1955. If you add in the large numbers of fish fry still being raised in the fish ponds, it far exceeds the records of previous years." The chief accountant excitedly opened the statistics book and boasted about the cooperative's achievements in fish farming.

    "Because we made some bold innovations, we almost doubled the fish production at once!" The township party secretary Ye Zilin added, "Shen Fuxing is also an experienced fish farming expert, and he has put the most thought into the cooperative's fish farming. He and several experienced old farmers in the cooperative formed a technical group. They broke the traditional practice of raising only one batch of fish each year, and cultivated both spring flowers and summer flowers (fish fry from spring and summer), and adopted the method of raising large and small fish in separate ponds. As a result, both seasons of fish flowers could be harvested in the autumn, and the harvest of silver carp alone increased by 110 dan."

    Shen Fuxing's spirit of boldly innovating is not only reflected in major production, but also in sideline production. It is said that the cooperative exceptionally raised silkworms four times last year. Because he promptly strengthened the supervision and leadership of the silkworm raising technical group, a total of 490 silkworm cards were raised last year, and all the harvests were very good.

    Under Shen Fuxing's influence and help, many people who did not like to work have also actively participated in production. There was a well-known "good-for-nothing" in the cooperative named Zhou Genxing, who spent his days drinking and loitering, working at most four or five days a month. When he ran out of money, he would sell his cotton quilt and mosquito net. Everyone thought he was "beyond saving." One day, he stole a pumpkin from someone else's field and was discovered by several members of the Communist Youth League, who tied him up in the big temple. That day, Shen Fuxing just happened to pass by the temple door and went in to untie him, patiently advising him. Later, the members of the Communist Youth League learned about this and criticized Shen Fuxing for protecting relatives. Shen Fuxing said, "Regardless of whether he is my relative or not, it is wrong for you to tie people up arbitrarily. Tying him up won't reform him. We must help him truly understand the glory of labor. He might even become a good hand." After that, Shen Fuxing did not relax his education of Zhou Genxing because of this criticism, and often went to Zhou Genxing's home to talk. During the autumn distribution last year, Zhou Genxing received more than 70 yuan. Shen Fuxing notified the accountant not to distribute all of it to him, but to have the cooperative help him make a cotton coat and a new cotton quilt, give him a small amount of pocket money, and the rest would be kept by the cooperative for him. Zhou Genxing was very touched when he saw the new cotton quilt on the bed. He smiled and said to everyone, "I've never had such a good quilt in my life. Now it won't be difficult to find a partner." He grabbed Shen Fuxing and said, "You wait and see, I won't let you down. I guarantee I'll work 28 days a month from now on!"

    Shen Fuxing firmly grasped production, and utilized all the conditions and forces that could be utilized, so that the Qingfeng Cooperative achieved a comprehensive harvest in the first year of its establishment. The total net income of the whole cooperative was more than 165,000 yuan, an increase of 49.9% compared to the total net income of the two elementary cooperatives in 1955. After the autumn distribution, each household received an average of more than 660 yuan, an average of 141 yuan per person, and the unit price per labor day was more than 1.80 yuan. More than 90% of the cooperative members increased their income. We curiously asked several cooperative members, "The production conditions of the nearby Lühua Fishery Cooperative are not as good as yours, but the unit price per labor day is more than 1.90 yuan. With your good conditions, why is it still less than theirs?" They all said calmly, "Our foundation is much thicker than theirs. If you don't believe it, go look at the fish in our fish ponds. If we distributed them all, each labor day would be worth at least three yuan. We're keeping these foundations, and as long as all of us, men, women, old, and young, work hard, we won't be afraid of stumbling a few times!"

    The father of cooperative member Zhou Yujiang, who is already 74 years old, saw the strength of the younger generation through the facts of the advanced cooperative this year. He gave a thumbs up and said, "Shen Fuxing is good! Choosing him as the director was the right decision. I've lived this long life, raised four sons, and married four wives. They argued all day long, and I, the old man, couldn't control them. I didn't expect them to manage such a large family of hundreds of households, and still be able to make everyone increase their income and be happy. I admire it! I admire it!"

    “选他当社主任没错”
    本报记者　张竞　越峨
    太阳悄悄地爬上了洞庭东山的山头，晨雾还滞留在半山腰里，发散着温润的寒气。一夜浓霜，给大地披上了银白色的外衣。虽然是严冬季节，临太湖边的一大片桔树林，却依然是枝叶茂密，绿荫丛丛，朝霞映着晨雾，在树梢头上轻轻浮游。山下面，一方方明镜似的鱼池里，飘动着薄薄的冰片，仿佛池底的鱼也开始活跃起来了。
    住在这依山傍水、丰腴美丽的东山脚下的，是江苏省震泽县庆丰高级花果渔业社的二百多户人家。
    听说，这个社的生产是全县的“第一块牌子”，社主任沈富兴，是“呱呱叫”的好干部。我们就在一个严寒的早晨来到了这里。
    当我们找到社的办公室的时候，正看见两个人脸红脖子粗地在争吵。其中矮胖一点的人责问瘦个子：“三千斤豆饼哪里去了？”
    住在近旁的一个妇女告诉我们说：那个瘦子就是社主任沈富兴。
    奇怪！为什么人人夸赞的社主任，这样粗暴地对人？为什么还有人怀疑他贪污？我们正在疑惑，一个干部模样的人，手里拿着一串钥匙进来了。他是社里的保管员沈德隆。我们马上就问起了这件事。沈德隆说：“我们社主任向来不是那种偷偷摸摸的人，待人做事都很实实在在；可是谁要冤枉了他，他可不答应。不信，你们看！”沈德隆一面说，一面就顺手把保管屋的门打开，引我们进去，原来三千斤豆饼还原封不动锁在里面哩。
    从保管室走出来，沈德隆继续向我们介绍情况：我们这个社除花果外，渔业也是一项主要的生产，社主任早已计划好把那些豆饼大部分用在发展渔业生产上，那个社员怀疑错了。同志，你们大概已经看见，前山脚下三百多只鱼池都是我们社里的，去年我们又开了一百五十亩荒塘，打算再发展一些鱼池，春天下去寸把长的鱼秧，秋天上来一条就有二斤重，比种果树要快得多。
    当晚，我们就在这个社里住了下来。我们渐渐地知道了：庆丰社是1956年春天才由金星、迎盛两个初级社合并组织起来的，沈富兴还是第一年当高级社的主任，社员们感到满意的是“新主任全心全意领导生产，使大家增加了收入”。
    庆丰社建社的时候，正是青黄不接，社里资金短缺的当口，一部分贫农社员的生活存在困难，中农也乘机跟着起哄，大家都围在合作社里嚷着要借钱，沈富兴刚当社主任不久，也不懂怎么处理，就跑到区里去求援，区里又哪有钱借呢！沈富兴只得仍旧回家。一跨进门，凳上、床上、桌子上、踏板上一直到水缸盖上、灶头上都坐满了人，中农金阿二甚至把自己的三个儿女二只小猪送来要社主任养活。大家一见沈富兴进来，一齐都围了上去，沈富兴没有说话，跑进房里就把床底下一对铜腊烛台，一只钢脚炉，和在初级社分到的一百五十多元，统统拿出来放在桌上，跟大家说：
  “社里实在没有钱，区里也不借，我家里只有这点值钱的东西，先借给生活最困难的社员维持几天再说吧！”沈富兴拿出来的钱和东西，就马上分别借给几户最困难的贫农，解决了他们生产和生活问题。中农也不敢起哄了，金阿二经过沈富兴一番口舌，也把孩子领回去了。好容易把金阿二打发走，沈富兴老婆又一把眼泪一把鼻涕地哭起来，唠唠叨叨地骂了四天四夜。
    沈富兴蹩着一肚子的苦恼，一个人爬到东山头上坐下来，想想大家选他当社主任，他却一点办法也没有，以后怎么干下去呢？想到这里，眼泪禁不住扑簌簌的掉了下来。
    第二天他还是硬着头皮去找区长，区长看看他红肿的眼圈，心平气和地跟他作了一次谈话：沈富兴同志，领导好一个高级社，本来很不容易，你的困难还是开始，要紧的是先把生产抓起来，你们社里的山、水、花果、鱼池哪一项不是生财之道，只要好好利用，在生产上打下底子，到年底让社员个个增加了收入，说不一定人人夸你是好主任呢！区长这一番话，好像一贴清凉剂，把几天的苦恼一下都消失。
    从此以后，他的一份心思几乎全操在生产上去了。8月2日那次十二级大台风袭来的时候，震撼山谷的狂风，整整刮了一天一夜，一棵棵古老的枇杷树，被摇曳着倒下来，有的几乎连根拔了起来，就在狂风暴雨的夜晚，沈富兴没有回家去，社干部也都顶着风雨跑到社的办公室里来，大家计议着台风过后抢救果树的办法，他们估计到了最坏的情况，也想出了各种不同的抢救办法。一等台风稍停，大家就分头到各小队里去，动员全体社员抢救。仅仅两天功夫，两千多棵被刮倒的果树全部扶救了起来，而且绝大部分都活得很好。现在，半山腰里盛开着的一撮撮的淡黄色的枇杷花，被宽阔的枇杷叶衬托着，在那毛茸茸的花蕊里正孕育着丰硕的果实。社员们很感慨地对我们说：“要不是抢救得好，这批果树早就劈成烧火的木柴了。”
    这一带因为临近太湖边，农民养鱼已经有二百多年的历史，现在庆丰社里也有好几户世代养鱼的能手，可是“往年年年养，不如去年好，去年组织高级社第一年，全社共产鱼二十二万九千多斤，比1955年增加了78％，如果加上还在鱼池里放养着的大批鱼苗，就大大超过历年来的纪录。”会计主任兴奋地打开了统计簿，向我们夸耀着社里养鱼的成绩。
    “因为我们来了几个大胆的革新，所以一下就把鱼的产量提高了近一倍！”乡支部书记叶子林接上来告诉我们说：“沈富兴也是一个有经验的养鱼能手，对社里养鱼的事他动的脑筋最多。他和社里几个有经验的老农组织了一个技术组，他们打破了历年只养一批鱼的传统习惯，分两批培养了春花和夏花（春夏两季的鱼秧），而且采取大鱼小鱼分塘养的办法，结果两季鱼花，到秋天都能收上来，单白鲢鱼就多收了一百一十担。”
    沈富兴大胆革新的精神不仅体现在主要的生产里，对副业生产他也同样如此，据说，社里去年还破例地养了四季蚕，因为他及时加强了对养蚕技术小组的督促和领导，去年共养了四百九十张蚕种，全部收成很好。
    在沈富兴的影响和帮助下，很多不爱劳动的人也积极生产了。社里有个有名的“二流子”，名叫周根兴，整天酗酒闲逛，一个月顶多干四、五天的活，没有钱花就把棉被蚊帐卖掉，大家都认为他已“无药可救”，有一天，他偷了人家田里的南瓜，被几个青年团员发现了，把他绑在大庙里。那天沈富兴刚走过庙门口，进去就替他解了绑，耐心地规劝他一番。后来青年团员们知道了这件事，批评沈富兴包庇亲戚。沈富兴说：“不管是不是我的亲戚，你们随便绑人是不对的。绑一下也不能改造他，要帮助他真正懂得劳动的光荣，说不定还是一把好手。”以后，沈富兴并不为这个批评而放松了对周根兴的教育，还常常到周根兴家里谈谈。去年秋季分配中，周根兴分到七十多元，沈富兴通知会计不要全部分给他，让社里帮他做了一件棉袄，一条新棉被，给他少数零用钱，其余都由社里帮他保管起来。周根兴看到床上放着的新棉被，心里很感动，他逢人便笑着说：“一生没盖过这么好的被，现在要找个对象也不难了。”他拉住沈富兴说：“你看吧，我不给你丢脸，保证以后一个月干二十八天活！”
    沈富兴紧紧抓住生产，利用了一切可以利用的条件和力量，使庆丰社建社第一年就在生产上取得了全面丰收。全年全社纯收入十六万五千多元，比1955年两个初级社纯收入的总和增加了49.9％。秋季分配后，每户平均分得六百六十多元，每人平均一百四十一元，每个劳动日单价是一元八角多。全社90％以上的社员都增加了收入。我们曾好奇地问过好几个社员：“附近绿化渔业社生产条件没有你们好，每个劳动日单价却是一元九角多，你们这么好的条件，为什么还比他们少呢？”他们都泰然自若地说：“我们的底子可比他们厚多了，不相信你去看看我们鱼池里的鱼，假使统统分掉，每个劳动日起码可值得三块钱。我们留着这些底子，只要我们全社男女老少一鼓劲的干，再跌几个跟斗也不怕！”
    社员周裕江的父亲，已经七十四岁了，高级社这一年的事实，使他看到了年轻一代的力量，他竖起大拇指说：“沈富兴，好！选他当社主任没有错，我活了这大把年纪，养了四个儿子，讨了四房媳妇，整天吵架我老头还管不住，不想他们当这么大一个几百户的大家，还能弄得个个增加收入，人人高兴，我佩服！佩服！”
