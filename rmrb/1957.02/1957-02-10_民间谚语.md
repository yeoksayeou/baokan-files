    Folk Proverbs
    Diligent cultivation and hard work bring everything; laziness leads to nothing.
    Save a handful each day, and in ten years you can buy a horse.
    Grains of rice accumulate into a basket, and drops of water form a river.
    Accumulating wealth is like picking soil with a needle; wasting it is like sand washed away by water.
    Eating doesn't make you poor, nor does wearing clothes; failing to plan makes you poor for life.
    Sitting idle will collapse a mountain; diligent hands will never suffer poverty.
    Don't fear famine years, only relying on heaven.
    A small stream flows continuously, meticulous calculation.
    Getting up early three mornings is like one day of work, avoiding the rush during the busy farming season.
     Raise chickens and ducks well, and there will be oil and salt in the house.
