Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, February 25th: Longsheng Autonomous County, Guangxi Province, which has already achieved the ethnicization of its government organs, is focusing on improving the quality of its ethnic minority cadres. Strict study systems have been established in all sixty departments under the autonomous county, and 60% of the on-the-job cadres are participating in political theory studies. The number of cadres participating in spare-time cultural classes has increased by two times compared to the original number. In addition, the various government organs have also selected more than one hundred ethnic minority cadres to leave their posts and study at relevant schools inside and outside the province.

Through these studies, the political thought and cultural level of these cadres have been improved. Hundreds of rural cadres who have persisted in long-term study have transformed from illiterate to intellectuals, and cadres who originally only had a primary school education have raised their cultural level to upper primary and junior high school level. The first group of Miao and Yao cadres who returned to the county after studying in Beijing, Wuhan and other places are now able to carry out their work independently. Han and Zhuang cadres have also examined their great Han chauvinism in their studies, further strengthening national unity. In order to set a study example for all cadres, an activity to select outstanding workers was carried out throughout the county in mid-February of this year, and one hundred and twenty-three ethnic minority cadres were awarded prizes, and ninety-five were nominated for commendation.

With the strengthening of study and the general improvement of cadres' political consciousness, criticism and self-criticism have been gradually carried out in various government organs. Some phenomena in the past that simply emphasized praise and encouragement, and avoided criticism for fear of damaging feelings, have now begun to be corrected.

    组织干部参加理论和文化学习
    龙胜各族自治县不断提高民族干部水平
    新华社桂林25日电　已经实现机关民族化的广西省龙胜各族自治县，正在着重提高民族干部的质量。自治县所属六十个机关部门中，都已建立了严格的学习制度，60％的在职干部都参加了政治理论学习。参加业余文化班学习的干部，已比原来增加两倍。此外，各机关还选送了一百多名民族干部，离职到省内外有关学校学习。
    这些干部在学习中，政治思想和文化水平均有所提高。坚持长期学习的数百名农村干部已从文盲开始变成知识分子，原来只有初级小学程度的干部，文化水平已提高到高小和初中程度。前一批从北京、武汉等地学习后回县的苗、瑶族干部，现在都能独立进行工作。汉、僮族干部在学习中还检查了大民族主义思想，进一步加强了民族团结。为了给全体干部树立学习榜样，今年2月中旬，在全县范围内进行了一次评选优秀工作者运动，有一百二十三名民族干部受奖，有九十五名被提名表扬。
    随着学习的加强和干部政治觉悟的普遍提高，各机关的批评和自我批评已逐步开展起来。过去某些单纯强调表扬鼓励，害怕损伤感情而回避批评的若干现象，现在都已开始纠正。
