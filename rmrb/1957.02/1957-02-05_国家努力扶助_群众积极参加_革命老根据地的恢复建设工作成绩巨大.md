The restoration and construction work in the old revolutionary base areas has made tremendous achievements in the few years since liberation, and the face of the old base areas has undergone fundamental changes. In many areas, a thriving phenomenon of "surplus grain, herds of cattle and sheep, good crops, and new houses everywhere" has emerged.

Over the years, the Central Government and governments at all levels have provided a lot of assistance to the old areas. The central government alone allocated 55.24 million yuan in special subsidies to the old areas from 1952 to 1956. Jiangxi Province has focused on supporting areas severely damaged by the enemy, and has issued a total of 5.02 million yuan in production and living subsidies to the old areas from 1949 to 1956. Since 1952, Fujian Province has distributed 5.6 million yuan in operating expenses and more than 4 million yuan in social relief funds to the old areas. Financial departments in various regions have also given a lot of special care to the masses in the old areas. For example, the banking system in Sichuan Province issued 20.35 million yuan in agricultural loans to the old areas from 1953 to 1955, which is twice the loan amount in general areas, and the stipulated interest rate is low and the repayment period is long.

Under the care of the Party and the government, the people in the old areas have continued to carry forward the revolutionary tradition and have shown great enthusiasm in agricultural cooperation and the restoration and development of production. Ruijin, the famous "Red Capital" of Jiangxi, had realized cooperativization in 1956, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 99.8% of the total number of peasant households, of which the number of peasant households joining advanced cooperatives accounted for 97.8% of the total number of peasant households. Agricultural cooperation has also been basically realized in other regions. Since liberation, the old areas of Fujian Province have vigorously carried out water conservancy projects and reclaimed economic forests such as tea gardens, bamboo forests, and oil tea. Production in most old areas has been restored, and grain production in plains or areas with convenient transportation has exceeded the level before the revolution.

In response to the call to green the motherland, the people in the old areas of Hebei Province have planted more than 2.4 million mu of forests and closed mountains for afforestation on 10.38 million mu. The old area of ​​Longdong in Gansu Province actively developed livestock. Compared with before liberation, cattle increased by 42.52% in 1956; horses increased by 122.96%; goats increased by 74%; and sheep increased by 83%.

In order to revitalize the economy of the old areas and facilitate the exchange of materials, the transportation industry has also developed considerably. Sichuan Province has newly built and restored 662 kilometers of highways in the old areas, opened 382 kilometers of waterways, and completed 1,805 kilometers of avenues and pack animal roads. With the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing and Baoji-Chengdu Railways, the situation of "the Shu Road is difficult" has changed greatly. Except for one county, all counties in the old area of ​​northern Shaanxi are accessible by highway. With the restoration and development of production, the income of the people in the old areas has increased and their material and cultural lives have been significantly improved. In Henan Province in 1950, the average grain yield per person in the old areas of the province was 417 jin, and in 1955 it had increased to 588 jin. As grain production has increased year by year, the phenomenon of eating bran and wild vegetables in the past has changed. Qiling Township in Yongding County, Fujian Province, is a famous old revolutionary base area in western Fujian. It was burned down by the enemy seven times in the past and became a deserted ruin. Now, 956 new houses have been built in the township, and the vast majority of the masses have achieved a living standard of "eating without mixing bran, having surplus grain in the barn" and "having cotton in winter and sheets in summer."

Cultural, educational and health undertakings in the old revolutionary base areas have also developed greatly. Since 1952, 361 primary schools have been added in the old areas of Fujian Province, 221 school buildings have been built, and 1,617 teachers have been added. The number of children enrolled in schools in the old areas has increased greatly. At the same time, 1.1 million yuan was allocated for medical fee reductions and exemptions, and mobile medical teams were organized to go deep into the old areas to provide medical treatment with reduced fees or free of charge. In Hong'an County, Hubei Province, there were 13 primary schools with 3,150 students in 1950. Now there are 492 primary schools with 34,086 students.

There are a particularly large number of family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, and old revolutionaries in the old revolutionary base areas, and doing a good job in preferential treatment has great political significance. There are more than 40,000 households of old revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in Fujian Province. Since 1953, the government has provided regular and quantitative subsidies to the 1,248 old revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who have no labor and no support, and properly solved their living difficulties. Twenty-six counties have carried out posthumous support for sacrificed martyrs and deceased revolutionary workers. Old revolutionaries, family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers in Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, account for about 80% of the total population of the county. In the past few years since liberation, a total of 3,154,800 yuan of preferential treatment and social relief funds and 997,559 jin of relief grain have been distributed to them, solving their difficulties in production and life. Appropriate arrangements have also been made for the work of old revolutionaries. There are now more than 600 old revolutionaries working in the county.

Although great achievements have been made in the restoration and construction of the old revolutionary base areas, there are still many old areas that are remote, inconvenient in transportation, and have poor natural conditions. In addition, the leading organs do not pay enough attention to them, the restoration and development of production is very slow, and the masses still have many difficulties in production and life. Therefore, the restoration and construction work in the old revolutionary base areas should continue to be strengthened.

    国家努力扶助　群众积极参加
    革命老根据地的恢复建设工作成绩巨大
    本报讯　解放后几年来老根据地的恢复建设工作已取得巨大成就，老根据地的面貌已起了根本变化。不少地区出现了“粮食有余、牛羊成群、庄稼长得好、房子一片新”的欣欣向荣现象。
    中央和各级人民政府历年来对老区作了很多扶助。仅中央从1952年到1956年拨给老区的特殊补助费即达五千五百二十四万元。江西省对遭受敌人严重破坏的地区进行了重点扶持，自1949年至1956年共发给老区生产生活补助款五百零二万元。福建省从1952年以来共发放老区事业费五百六十万元，社会救济费四百余万元。各地财经部门对老区群众也进行了不少特殊照顾。如四川省银行系统从1953年到1955年发放老区的农贷款即达二千零三十五万元，贷款面较一般地区大一倍，而且规定的利息低，归还期较长。
    老区人民在党和政府的关怀下，继续发扬了革命传统，在农业合作化和恢复发展生产中表现了很大的积极性。著名的“红色首都”江西的瑞金，在1956年已实现了合作化，入社农户已占总农户的99.8％，其中加入高级社的农户已占总农户的97.8％。其他各地也都基本上实现了农业合作化。福建省的老区，解放以来大力兴修水利、垦复茶园、竹山、油茶等经济林，大部老区的生产已经恢复，粮食生产在平原或交通方便的地区已超过革命前的水平。
    河北省老区人民为积极响应绿化祖国的号召，已造林二百四十多万亩，封山育林一千零三十八万亩。甘肃省陇东老区积极发展牲畜，1956年和解放前相比，牛增加42.52％；马增加122.96％；山羊增加74％；绵羊增加83％。
    为了活跃老区经济，便利物资交流，交通运输事业也有了不少发展。四川省在老区新修和恢复公路六百六十二公里，开辟航道三百八十二公里，完成大道、驮运道路共一千八百零五公里，配合着成渝、宝成路的通车，“蜀道难”的情况已有很大改变。陕北老区除一县外已县县通公路。随着生产的恢复和发展，老区人民的收入已有增加，物质文化生活有了显著的改善。河南省1950年全省老区人民每人平均收粮四百一十七斤，1955年每人平均已增加到五百八十八斤。由于粮食逐年增加，过去吃糠咽菜的现象已经改变。福建省永定县歧岭乡是闽西著名的老根据地，过去曾被敌人烧毁七次，成为绝灭人烟的废墟，现在全乡修建了九百五十六间新房，绝大部分群众已达到“吃饭不掺糠，囤里有余粮”和“冬有棉夏有单”的生活水平。
    老根据地的文教卫生事业也有很大的发展。福建省老区从1952年以来，增设小学三百六十一所，修建校舍二百二十一所，增加教员一千六百一十七名，老区入学儿童已大大增加。同时拨出医疗减免费一百一十万元，组织巡回医疗队，深入老区进行减费或免费医疗。湖北省红安县1950年有小学十三所，学生有三千一百五十人，现在有小学四百九十二所，学生三万四千零八十六人。
    老根据地烈军属、残废军人以及老革命人员特别多，做好优抚工作有着重大的政治意义。福建省共有老烈军属四万多户，其中无劳力又无依靠的一千二百四十八名老烈军属，从1953年起政府就给予定期定量补助，妥善地解决了他们的生活困难。对牺牲的烈士、病故的革命工作人员已有二十六个县进行了追恤。江西省瑞金县的老革命人员、烈军属、革命残废军人约占全县总人口的80％。解放几年来，对他们共发放优抚和社会救济款三百一十五万四千八百元、救济粮九十九万七千五百五十九斤，解决了他们生产生活上的困难。对老革命人员的工作也进行了适当的安置。现在全县老革命人员担任工作的有六百余人。
    老根据地的恢复建设工作虽已取得很大成绩，目前仍有不少老区地处偏僻，交通不便，自然条件差，加上领导机关不够重视，生产的恢复和发展都很慢，群众在生产和生活上还有很多困难。因此老根据地的恢复建设工作，还应继续加强。
