    Starting with "Chief Niu"
    Wang Liang
    Since the satirical film "Before the New Director Arrives" has been shown in various places, it has aroused great interest among the people. "Chief Niu" and his colleagues, as typical figures of flattery, deception of superiors and subordinates, boasting and bootlicking, have been disgusted by cadres of institutions and organizations and the vast number of young students. They have made many criticisms of bad people and bad deeds in relevant general affairs work. Similar critical articles have also appeared from time to time in some newspapers and magazines. Some general affairs staff of institutions and organizations have also been deeply touched, and based on this, have made many valuable efforts to improve their own ideological style, and in improving food management, adjusting offices and dormitories, and other matters related to the lives of the masses. All of the above shows that the film "Before the New Director Arrives" has great practical significance and educational significance. It should be affirmed, without question.
    However, the title of "Chief Niu" has been abused by some机关 cadres and young students. Nicknames such as "Chief Niu," "Chief Niu's student," and "Chief Niu's apprentice" are often heard in daily conversations.
    If you don't believe it, let's look at specific examples. A cadre of a certain institution, not long after receiving his salary and with no special needs, insisted on borrowing his salary for the next month. The head of the General Affairs Section, bound by the system, could not approve the loan, so the hat of "Chief Niu" was placed on him; a cadre of a certain institution was on a business trip and had originally negotiated with the General Affairs Section to take the institution's car to the train station to catch the train. Unfortunately, a certain leader needed the car temporarily for official business, and the General Affairs staff hurriedly explained the situation and asked them to take the public bus instead, which aroused great resentment among this group of travelers, and the "honorable title" of "Chief Niu's apprentice" was bestowed upon them.
    Similar examples are often heard among young students. The general affairs department of a certain university failed to meet the requirement of "one thermos bottle for each student" (only one was provided for each dormitory room), and was considered to be not concerned about students' lives, and the nickname and cartoon of "Chief Niu" emerged accordingly.
    The above examples are obviously the most prominent. As for those who complain and scold "Chief Niu" because they are dissatisfied with the inadequate care in daily life (food, accommodation, and office supplies, etc.) due to limited conditions, there are even more.
    "Chief Niu" and his partners, in order to satisfy their personal "desires," resort to flattery, deception of superiors and subordinates, boasting and bootlicking, which is obviously incompatible with the new society, new morality, and new customs. It is only natural that this kind of bad ideology and style of work is hated and criticized by people. But what about those who scold others as "Chief Niu" because their personal excessive desires cannot be satisfied? They should think about it themselves!

    从“牛科长”说起
    汪亮
    讽刺片“新局长到来之前”在各地放映以来，引起了人们极大的兴趣。作为阿谀逢迎、瞒上欺下、吹牛拍马的典型人物的“牛科长”和他的同僚们，遭到了机关、团体干部和广大青年学生的厌恶，对有关总务工作中的坏人、坏事作了不少指摘，类似性质的批评文章，在某些报章杂志上亦时有所见。某些机关、团体的总务工作人员，亦深有感触，据此以改进自己的思想作风，在改善伙食管理、调整办公室和宿舍等关系群众生活方面，作了很多可贵的努力。诸如此类，说明了电影“新局长到来之前”，是有很大的现实意义和教育意义的。自应肯定，不在话下。
    可是，“牛科长”的称呼，却被部分机关干部和青年学生滥用了。“牛科长”、“牛科长的学生”、“牛科长的徒弟”……等绰号，在日常谈话中，时有所闻。
    不信，且摆具体事例。某机关一干部，发薪不久，又无特殊需要，硬要借支下月工薪，总务科长碍于制度，未能照借，于是，“牛科长”的帽子就给扣上去了；某机关干部因公出差，原与总务科交涉好坐机关小汽车到火车站去搭车，事不凑巧，某首长临时因公外出需用，总务人员赶忙说明原委，请他们改乘公共汽车，却引起了这班出差人员极大的反感，“牛科长的徒弟”的“尊称”也就出来了。
    同样事例，在青年学生中也时有所闻。某高等学校的总务部门，未能满足“每个学生发一个热水瓶”的要求（只做到了每个寝室发一只），便被认为不关心学生生活，“牛科长”的绰号和漫画也就应运而生。
    以上所举，显系荦荦大者。至于说，在日常生活中（食、住和办公用具等），因限于条件，照顾不周而不满，而发牢骚，而大骂“牛科长”者，更大有人在。
    “牛科长”和他的伙伴们为了满足个人“欲望”，而至阿谀逢迎，瞒上欺下，吹牛拍马，显然与新社会、新道德、新风尚格格不入，这种坏思想作风受到人们的憎恨和指摘，固属理所当然。但那些因个人过高欲望不能满足而骂别人为“牛科长”的人们又该如何？他们自己应该想一想！
