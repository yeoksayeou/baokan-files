This Dispatch from Guangzhou, February 8th: Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, which has been awarded the title of "Thousand-Jin Rice County" for consecutive years, is carrying out in-depth preparations for spring plowing.

This year, Chao'an County plans to continue increasing the yield of more than 300,000 mu of double-cropping rice fields, striving to increase the average yield per mu from 1,010 jin in 1956 to 1,076 jin. To accomplish this plan, the county launched a preparatory campaign two months ago centered on increasing production and practicing economy, and running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. Agricultural production cooperatives have generally launched members to consciously save funds to invest in the cooperatives and assist them in solving the difficulties of insufficient production funds by checking waste and calculating detailed accounts. According to incomplete statistics, the county's 457 cooperatives received more than 540,000 yuan in savings investments from members in just over a month. In order to reduce production costs and make up for the shortage of commercial fertilizer supply, agricultural cooperatives are actively exploring fertilizer sources and launching fertilizer accumulation competitions. The county accumulated more than 2 million dan of fertilizer on the day with the most accumulation. By the Spring Festival, the county had accumulated more than 60 million dan of various fertilizers, an average of 195 dan of fertilizer per mu, exceeding the plan of accumulating 160 dan of fertilizer per mu before spring plowing. At the same time, 4,000 to 5,000 people are mobilized every day to build water conservancy projects. All five key water conservancy projects planned to be completed before spring plowing have started. After these five projects are completed, it is estimated that more than 30,000 mu of land can benefit from irrigation. Most of the 3,461 small-scale water conservancy projects planned to be built have been completed.

In order to further promote agricultural technology reform, the agricultural technology extension stations in the county's 25 townships, on the one hand, summed up the experience of last year's agricultural technology reform to strengthen the masses' confidence, and on the other hand, trained a grass-roots technical team of 3,000 people with seed treatment and cultivating strong seedlings as the main content. The county plans to universally adopt high-quality rice varieties and implement small-scale, close planting across the board. At the same time, the county's leading departments have also mobilized agricultural cooperatives to formulate production plans and implement a fixed quota "three guarantees" system, starting from improving production management to promote the preparatory work.

Currently, the leading departments of Chao'an County have organized spring plowing preparation inspection teams to inspect each agricultural cooperative and assist in solving problems in preparation work. Most of the county's 457 cooperatives have completed the preparation of seeds, plowing cattle, and farm tools. Sixty-five cooperatives have started to prepare the fields, sixty-six cooperatives have started to soak seeds, and the cooperatives that started earlier have sown the seeds. (Xiao Juncheng)

    水稻千斤县——潮安加紧备耕
    争取每亩平均产量达到一千零七十六斤
    本报广州8日电　连年获得水稻千斤县称号的广东省潮安县深入展开备耕工作。
    今年，潮安县计划继续提高三十多万亩双季稻田的产量，争取每亩平均产量从1956年的一千零一十斤提高到一千零七十六斤。为了完成这个计划，早在两个月前，全县就掀起了一个以增产节约和勤俭办社为内容的备耕运动。各农业生产合作社，普遍通过查浪费和算细账等办法，发动社员自觉地节约资金投资合作社，协助合作社解决生产资金不足的困难。据不完全统计，全县四百五十七个社，在一个多月中，就收到社员节约投资五十四万多元。为了降低生产成本和弥补商品肥料供应的不足，各农业社都积极地挖掘肥源，开展积肥竞赛。全县积肥最多的一天达二百多万担。到春节止，全县积集的各种肥料已达六千多万担，平均每亩积肥一百九十五担，已超额完成春耕前每亩积肥一百六十担的计划。同时，每天都有四、五千人出动兴修水利，计划在春耕前完成的五项重点水利工程，已全部开工。这五项工程完成后，估计可以使三万多亩田受到灌溉的效益。计划兴修的三千四百六十一宗小型水利，已大部竣工。
    为了进一步推行农业技术改革，全县二十五个乡的农业技术推广站，一面通过总结去年农业技术改革的经验，坚定群众的信心，一面以种子处理和培育壮秧等为主要内容，训练了一支拥有三千人的基层技术队伍。全县计划普遍采用优良稻种和全部实行小科密植。同时，县领导部门还发动各农业社订制生产规划，实行定额三包制，从改进生产管理着手来推动备耕运动。
    现在，潮安县的领导部门组织了春耕备耕检查组，分别到各农业社检查和协助解决备耕中的问题。全县四百五十七个社大部分已做好种子、耕牛、农具等备耕工作。有六十五个社开始整田，六十六个社开始浸种，动手较早的社已播下了种子。　（肖俊城）
