    保加利亚国民议会第七届会议决定
    精简行政机构任命一批负责人
    据新华社索非亚2日电　保加利亚人民共和国国民议会第七届会议1日在索非亚开幕。会议通过的议程包括：合并某些部和主管机关、任免一批政府部门负责人、选举国民议会主席团新委员以及通过1957年度国家预算等。
    部长会议主席于哥夫就第一项议程提出了建议。他指出，在人民政权建立以后的十二年当中，全国各方面涌现了大量干练的干部，这样就有可能大大精简和加强行政管理机构，把某些部和主管机关加以合并。
    根据于哥夫提出的建议，国民议会决定，把运输部和邮电部、建设部和建设材料部、文化部和教育部、财政部和国家监察委员会、对外贸易部和国内贸易部都加以合并。还有其他一些部也要合并。
    接着，会议通过了任免政府有关各部门负责人员的决定。会议批准部长会议副主席达米扬诺夫兼任商业部长，部长会议副主席契尔文科夫兼任教育和文化部长，部长会议副主席米哈伊洛夫兼任运输和邮电部长；解除卢卡诺夫的部长会议副主席职务而保留他的外交部长职务。会议还决定解除日夫科·日夫科夫、佩洛夫斯基、鲁宾·阿弗拉莫夫、雅涅夫、丹乔·季米特洛夫、吉切夫和德拉戈伊切娃等人所担任的政府有关各部门负责职务。
