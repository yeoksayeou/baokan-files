    Make Use of Pig Brain Pituitary Glands
    The "pig brain pituitary gland" contains abundant "hormones," which are valuable raw materials for pharmaceutical production. It has the function of helping mothers contract their uterus after childbirth. Oxytocin injections, galactagogue, growth hormone and other injections also need it as a raw material. It can be exported, with each one worth 1 jiao and 1 fen. In the past, "pig brain pituitary glands" were sold along with the pig's head, which was a complete waste. Since mid-December last year, the Nanjing Municipal Food Company began processing "pig brain pituitary glands" to increase the country's wealth. If the company processes and exports all "pig brain pituitary glands" in 1957, it can increase national revenue by more than 20,000 yuan.

    把猪脑下垂腺利用起来
    “猪脑下垂腺”内含丰富的“荷尔蒙”，是制药的贵重原料。它有帮助产妇收缩子宫的功能。催生针、催奶素、生长素等针剂，也都需要它做原料。它可以出口，每个价值一角一分。“猪脑下垂腺”过去都随猪头出售，白白浪费了。从去年12月中旬起，南京市食品公司为增加国家财富，就开始加工“猪脑下垂腺”。1957年，该公司如把所有的“猪脑下垂腺”都加工出口，能为国家增加收入二万多元。
