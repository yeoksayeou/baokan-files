Liangshui River's Beijing Ducks
    The first batch of products from the Beijing Duck Farm of the Beijing Food Company—fat, tender, force-fed ducks—have successively appeared in the capital's vegetable markets, large restaurants, and Peking duck restaurants, supplying the needs of the people of the capital.

    These large, force-fed ducks are plump and meaty, with an average weight of over five jin per duck. They were hatched in October of last year from the first batch of eggs laid by the farm's breeding ducks, and the entire feeding process took only over eighty days.

    In the past, when force-fed ducks were raised by private individuals in a scattered manner, the off-season for force-fed ducks was after winter, and it was not easy to buy force-fed ducks in the market during the Spring Festival, and the quality was also poor. The reason is that in order to make more money, general duck farmers saw that the egg-laying rate of breeding ducks was high in spring and autumn, and the hatched ducks were easy to raise, so they controlled the breeding ducks to lay eggs in spring and autumn and stopped production after winter, resulting in a contradiction between seasonal production and year-round needs. After the establishment of the state-owned duck farm, artificial control of the egg production of breeding ducks was used to postpone the estrus and molting cycle, so that breeding ducks could lay eggs in a cycle throughout the year, ensuring that force-fed ducks are supplied to the market every season. Lai Fu, a duck-raising technician with more than 30 years of experience, said: "In the past, who would raise these ducks at this time! State-owned duck farms are always thinking about consumers."

    The Liangshui River in the southern suburbs of the capital has ripples all year round, and it does not freeze even in the severe winter.

    凉水河上的北京鸭
    北京市食品公司养鸭场，建场以后自孵自喂的第一批产品——肥嫩的大填鸭，陆续在首都菜市场、大饭馆、烤鸭店里出现，供应首都人民的需要。
    这批大填鸭，瞟肥肉厚，平均每只体重五市斤以上。它们诞生在去年10月间，用养鸭场种鸭的第一批卵孵出来的，全部饲养过程仅仅八十多天。
    过去由私人分散喂养填鸭时，每到入冬以后便是填鸭的淡季，春节时在市场上不易买到填鸭，质量也很差。原因是一般养鸭户为了多赚钱，见种鸭在春、秋两季产卵率高，孵出的鸭子又好养，便控制种鸭在春秋两季产卵、入冬后停产，结果便造成季节性生产和长年需要之间的矛盾。国营鸭场成立后，便用人工控制种鸭产卵，推迟歇窝换毛周期，使种鸭在一年四季内循环产卵，保证每季有填鸭供应市场。有三十多年饲养经验的养鸭技工来福说：“过去在这个时候，谁要养这些鸭子呢！国营鸭场就是处处为消费者着想。”
    首都南郊凉水河，一年四季都是微波荡漾，严冬也不结冰。左图是养鸭场的鸭群正在游水；碧波红掌，相映成趣。　唐兴庚　摄（附图片）
