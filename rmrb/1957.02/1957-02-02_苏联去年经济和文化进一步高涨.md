Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31st: The Central Statistical Bureau under the Council of Ministers of the USSR has released a communiqué on the execution of the 1956 State Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the USSR.

    The total industrial output increased by nearly 11%. More than a thousand of the most important new standard machines and equipment were created.

    The communiqué said that the industrial sector as a whole overfulfilled the annual total output value plan. In 1956, the total industrial output value increased by nearly 11% compared to 1955. The annual plans for many heavy industrial products and consumer goods were overfulfilled. However, there are still serious shortcomings in individual industrial sectors. For example, the execution of the plans for coal, metal, and cement production, as well as timber shipments, still lagged behind in 1956, which caused some difficulties for the work of individual sectors of the national economy. Some departments did not fulfill the plan, either in terms of total output value or in terms of major products.

    Last year, the output of Soviet industrial products increased significantly. Compared with 1955, the output of pig iron, steel, and steel products increased to 107%, coal mining increased to 110%, oil extraction increased to 118%, electricity increased to 113%, large electrical machines increased to 120%, tractors increased to 112%, and grain harvesting combines increased to 170%.

    Compared with 1955, the output of silk fabrics increased to 143%, washing machines increased to 225%, pianos increased to 130%, and cheese and other dairy products increased to 128%.

    The communiqué pointed out that electrification, comprehensive mechanization, and automation have been further developed in all sectors of the national economy. The Soviet machine-building industry has created more than a thousand of the most important new standard machines, machine tools, and equipment. Nearly fifteen hundred automated assembly lines have been adopted in production. Work has been carried out on the use of atomic energy in production processes.

    In 1956, more than 1.2 million inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals were adopted in the national economy.

    The sown area was expanded by 8.9 million hectares. An unprecedentedly abundant grain harvest was achieved, with the total harvest increasing by about 20%.

    In agriculture, the total sown area of various crops in 1956 was about 195 million hectares, an increase of 8.9 million hectares compared to 1955, and an increase of almost 38 million hectares in the last three years. The sown area of grain crops has increased by about 22 million hectares in the past three years, of which wheat has increased by 14 million hectares. The total grain harvest in 1956 increased by about 20% compared to 1955, which is much higher than the harvest of the best year in Soviet history. The smooth progress of the work of reclaiming wasteland is of particular importance to agricultural development.

    From October 1, 1955, to October 1, 1956, the number of cattle increased by 3.3 million head, totaling 70.4 million head.

    As of January 1, 1957, the state had procured 3.304 billion poods of grain, which is more than 1 billion poods more than the best year.

    The material and technical foundation of agriculture has been further strengthened. Agriculture received 248,000 tractors last year (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 114,000 trucks, 56,000 grain combine harvesters, and many other machines.

    The total investment in state capital construction in 1956 was 186 billion rubles, 17% more than in 1955. The state capital construction investment plan stipulated for 1956 was 94% completed. Last year, more than 800 new large-scale state-owned industrial enterprises were put into production.

    The number of employees in the Soviet national economy at the end of 1956 was 50 million, 2.1 million more than at the end of 1955. The labor productivity of industrial workers and construction workers increased by 7% and 10% respectively compared to 1955.

    National income increased by 12%. People's material and cultural life further improved.

    In 1956, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 12% compared to 1955. The average wage of employees increased by 3% compared to 1955, and the benefits and allowances for employees increased by 19% within a year. The cash and in-kind income of farmers (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 12%.

    In 1956, the Soviet government adopted a series of measures to improve the material welfare of the working people, enabling urban and rural working people to receive an additional 35 billion rubles of benefits in one year.

    Last year, about 50 million students studied in various schools and secondary technical schools, and 2 million students studied in institutions of higher education (including correspondence schools). In 1956, 760,000 graduates graduated from institutions of higher education.

    In 1956, state, cooperative organizations, and urban residents, at their own expense or relying on state loans, built a total of 36 million square meters of housing. Collective farmers and rural intellectuals built approximately 700,000 houses.

    苏联去年经济和文化进一步高涨
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12月31日讯：苏联部长会议所属中央统计局公布了1956年苏联发展国民经济国家计划执行情况的公报。
    工业总产值增加近11％。创造出一千多种最重要的新式标准机器和设备。
    公报说，工业部门整个说来超额完成了年度总产值计划。1956年工业总产值比1955年增加将近11％。许多重工业产品和消费品的年度计划都超额完成了。但是，个别工业部门还存在着严重的缺点。例如，1956年煤、金属和水泥产量以及木材运出量的计划的执行情况仍然落后，从而使得个别国民经济部门的工作遇到某些困难。某些部门不论是在总产值方面或是在主要产品方面都没有完成计划。
    去年，苏联工业品的产量大大增加。同1955年相比，生铁、钢和钢材产量增加为107％，煤的开采量增加为110％，石油开采量增加为118％，电力增加为113％，大型电气机器增加为120％，拖拉机增加为112％，谷物收获联合机增加为170％。
    同1955年相比，丝织品的产量增加为143％，洗衣机增加为225％，钢琴增加为130％，干酪和其他乳制品增加为128％。
    公报指出，在所有国民经济部门中，电气化、全盘机械化和自动化都有进一步的发展。苏联机器制造业创造出一千多种最重要的新式标准机器、机床和设备。将近一千五百种自动化流水作业线已在生产中采用。已经进行了在生产工艺过程中利用原子能的工作。
    1956年，在国民经济中采用的发明、技术改良和合理化建议超过了一百二十万件。
    播种面积扩大八百九十万公顷。谷物空前丰收，总收获量约增加20％。
    在农业方面，1956年各种作物的总播种面积约为一亿九千五百万公顷，比1955年增加八百九十万公顷，而最近三年来增加了几乎三千八百万公顷。谷物的播种面积在过去三年中增加了约二千二百万公顷，其中小麦增加了一千四百万公顷。1956年的谷物总收获量比1955年约增加20％，这比苏联历史上收成最好的年份的收获量还要高得多。开垦荒地的工作的顺利开展对农业发展具有特别重要的意义。
    从1955年10月1日到1956年10月1日，牛的头数增加了三百三十万头，总数为七千零四十万头。
    到1957年1月1日为止，国家征购了三十三亿零四百万普特的粮食，这比最好的年成还要多十亿多普特。
    农业的物质技术基础得到了进一步的加强。农业在去年获得了二十四万八千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），十一万四千辆载重汽车，五万六千台谷物联合收获机以及许多其他机器。
    1956年国家基本建设投资总额为一千八百六十亿卢布，比1955年多17％。1956年规定的国家基本建设投资计划完成了94％。去年有八百多个新的大型国营工业企业投入生产。
    苏联国民经济中的职工数目在1956年年底为五千万人，比1955年年底多二百一十万人。产业工人和建筑工人的劳动生产率分别比1955年提高7％和10％。
    国民收入增加12％。人民物质和文化生活进一步提高
    1956年苏联的国民收入比1955年提高了12％。职工的平均工资比1955年增加了3％，职工的优抚金和补助金一年内增加了19％。农民的现金和实物收入（按比较价格计算）增加了12％。
    1956年苏联政府采取了一系列提高劳动人民物质福利的措施，使城乡劳动人民一年中额外得到三百五十亿卢布的益处。
    去年，在各种学校和中等技术学校学习的学生约有五千万人，在高等学校（包括函授学校）学习的学生有二百万人。1956年高等学校毕业生达到七十六万人。
    1956年，国家、合作社组织和城市居民自费或依靠国家贷款共建造了面积达三千六百万平方公尺的住宅。集体农民和乡村知识分子约建造了七十万幢房屋。
