    Is This Waste Inevitable?
    Tián Gōng
    Despite the nation's need for a large amount of coal, the Wangjiahe No. 2 coal mine, which has already sunk its shafts and opened its roadways, has recently decided to halt construction of the entire mine, except for the already developed extractable coal seams.

    The Wangjiahe No. 2 coal mine is located in the heart of the Weibei coalfield in Shaanxi Province. According to current assessments, the coal seams near this mine are extremely unstable, forming wave-like shapes of varying thicknesses. In early 1954, Team 131 of the Northwest Coal Geology Bureau, after completing the exploration task at Sanlidong near Wangjiahe, accepted the task of exploring the Wangjiahe mine. Following the experience of Sanlidong, they arranged the density of boreholes at Wangjiahe and quickly began work. By early June of the same year, four boreholes were completed. Upon inspection, they found that the cores from three boreholes proved to be thin coal seams that did not meet the mining standards. Therefore, they believed that there was little hope and planned to stop drilling. Just at this time, the Director of the Geological Bureau came with experts to inspect the work. The experts raised doubts about the reliability of the drilling quality, and the comrades of the drilling team could not give a definite answer. Thus, it was decided to drill three more boreholes near the original three boreholes. Upon inspecting the cores of the six new coal-bearing boreholes, it was found that five layers met the extractable standards. Such completely contradictory results should have been enough to determine that the coal seams here were very complex. Unfortunately, this exploration team did not further investigate the situation and, relying on the existing contradictory data, put forward a "detailed investigation report" stating that "coal reserves were abundant."

    Subsequently, a series of errors occurred one after another: because the coal "reserves were abundant," the original plan to build one pair of mines was changed to two pairs of mines; although it was not suitable for formal design, it was designed according to formal standards. However, during construction, it was proven that some "extractable areas" became unextractable areas. Thus, the shaft location was considered to be inappropriately selected; the "stable" coal seams became unstable coal seams, and the coal reserves decreased from the original estimated 27.61 million tons to the later estimated 11.76 million tons. The original design was obviously not suitable. What to do? Continue tunneling? It is hard to say how much coal can be produced, and even if some coal can be produced, it is very uneconomical because the cost is too high. Stop immediately? More than 1.6 million yuan has already been spent. It is truly riding a tiger and hard to dismount. In the end, the only decision was to stop construction and use it temporarily.

    The geological exploration team is the scout for the construction of mines. If the situation is not clarified, a "detailed investigation report" is made, which leads the construction unit to formulate incorrect plans based on incorrect reports, the design department to carry out incorrect designs based on incorrect reports, and the construction department to carry out incorrect construction based on incorrect designs. A lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources are spent, only to find out that it was all a mistake. What a great loss this is to the country!

    Some people say that the underground situation is difficult to understand. Due to the lack of modern exploration equipment and exploration experience, some deviations and waste of investment are difficult to completely avoid.

    Precisely because the underground situation is difficult to understand, the exploration team should be more realistic and clarify it, and should never be careless. The errors in the exploration of the Wangjiahe No. 2 mine were not necessarily caused by the lack of modern drilling equipment or exploration experience, but by the dishonesty and lack of conscientious research in the ideological style of the exploration team.

    "The overturned cart in front serves as a warning to the carts behind." May all exploration teams take this as a reminder.

    这种浪费是不可避免的吗？
    田工
    尽管国家需要大量煤炭，可是，已经打好了井筒，开好了巷道的王家河二号矿井，除了已开拓的可采煤炭，仍继续开采以外，最近决定整个矿井停止建设了。
    王家河二号矿井，位于陕西省渭北煤田的中心地带。据现在判明，这个矿井附近的煤层极不稳定，薄一层、厚一层地成波浪形状。1954年初，西北煤炭地质局一三一队，在完成了王家河附近三里洞的勘探任务以后，又接受了勘探王家河矿井的任务。他们按着三里洞的经验布置了王家河钻孔的密度，很快地开始了工作。同年6月初，有四个钻孔完工了，经过他们检查的结果，有三个钻孔的岩心证明都是不合乎开采标准的薄煤层。于是，他们认为希望不大，打算停止钻探了。恰巧在这时候，地质总局局长带着专家来检查工作。专家曾提出了钻探质量是否可靠的疑问，钻探队的同志们也不能作肯定的答复。于是，又决定在原有三个钻孔的附近补打了三个钻孔，在检查了新打的六次见煤的岩心中，发现有五层是合乎可采标准的煤层。这种前后完全相反的结果，本来足以判断这里的煤层是很复杂的了。可惜，这个勘探队并没有进一步把情况查明，竟然凭着已有的前后矛盾的资料，提出了“精查报告”，认为“煤的储量丰富”。
    接着，一连串的错误就相继发生了：因为煤的“储量丰富”就把原来建设一对矿井的计划改为两对矿井；本来是不适合进行正规化设计的，也按正规化进行设计了。可是，在施工中证明：一部分“可采区”变成了不可采区，这样，井筒位置被认为是选择得不适当了；“稳定”的煤层变成了不稳定的煤层，煤的储量由原来预计的二千七百六十一万吨下降为后来预计的一千一百七十六万吨，原来的设计显然是不适用了。怎么办呢？继续掘进吧，究竟能出多少煤，很难说，即使能够出一些煤，因为成本太高，也很不合算。立即停止吧，已用去一百六十多万元了，真是骑虎难下，最后，只有决定停止建设而暂时使用了。
    地质勘探队是建设矿井的侦察员，情况没弄清就作了“精查报告”，这就使得建设单位根据错误的报告订出了错误的计划，使设计部门根据错误的报告进行了错误的设计，使得施工部门根据错误的设计进行了错误的施工，人力物力财力花费了好多，到头来发现是弄错了。这给国家带来多大的损失呀！
    有人说，地下的情况是不好弄的，由于缺乏现代化勘探设备，缺乏勘探经验，出些偏差，浪费些投资是难以完全避免的。
    正因为地下的情况不好弄，勘探队更应该实事求是地把它弄清楚，绝不能马虎从事；王家河二号井勘探中的错误，并不是由于没有现代化的钻探设备，也不是由于没有勘探经验所必然发生的，而是由于勘探队的人们在思想作风上的不老实，不用心研究所造成的。
    “前车之复，后车之鉴”，愿所有的勘探队共勉之。
