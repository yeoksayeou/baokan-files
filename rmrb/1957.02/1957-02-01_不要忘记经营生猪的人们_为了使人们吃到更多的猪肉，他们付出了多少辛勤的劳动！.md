    Don't Forget the People Who Raise Pigs
    How much hard work they put in to make sure people eat more pork!
    Zhao Jizong
    During the Spring Festival, when you are enjoying delicious pork, please do not forget the hard work of the people in the food companies who raise pigs.
    China Food Company operates a large number of live pigs throughout the country. Pigs, it seems, are not difficult to handle; however, it is not easy to ensure that every pig grows fat, does not get sick, and does not suffer losses during long-distance transportation.
    In 1954, the food company managed 14,450,000 live pigs. Because of a lack of experience, the mortality rate of pigs was very high, with more than 300,000 deaths throughout the year. The staff involved in managing live pigs felt sorry for so many pigs dying under their care and were determined to fight to eliminate pig mortality.
    In order to reduce pig mortality, they paid special attention to improving the transportation of live pigs, ensuring that pigs could live a safe life, eat well, drink well, and sleep well whether they were transported by land, or by car, train, boat, or ship. Many pigs even gained weight on the road!
    To transport pigs from place A to place B, land transportation is the most convenient and economical. The staff of the Shenqiu County Food Company in Henan Province have explored good experiences in transporting live pigs by land, with very few pig deaths along the way. Before transportation, they select pigs that are full of energy, similar in size, and have proper hooves and claws, specifically for external transportation; the rest are supplied to the local market. During transportation, they adhere to "slow driving and frequent breaks" and "fixed time and distance": rest for five minutes after driving five li, ten minutes after ten li, and half an hour after fifteen li, with a maximum daily distance of twenty-five to thirty li; drive during the day in cold winters, drive at night in hot summers, and drive in the early morning and evening in the mild spring and autumn seasons, with a rest at noon. The person at the front of the pig herd is the "leader", who walks backwards facing the herd in order to take care of them. The pigs are given three cooked meals a day, with fixed meals and quantities, to ensure that every pig is full. When lodging, someone takes shifts to watch over the pig herd, so that the pigs do not crowd or fight each other while sleeping. Some transporters even put cloth-soled shoes with leather bottoms on the pigs when they have to walk on mountain roads to avoid hurting their feet.
    When transporting pigs by car or train, the transporters work even harder. Fat pigs are not used to getting on trains or walking on narrow roads, so they first train "leader" pigs or use black goats to lead the way. On the train, they live in the same car with the pigs day and night, ensuring that the pigs are not hungry or thirsty and have cooked food and clean water to eat. They pay attention to the hygiene of the car and often clean it. If they find a sick pig, they try to treat and care for it in a timely manner. Some even bathe and wipe the backs of feverish pigs, sprinkle cold water, or use artificial fans to reduce the heat of the sick pigs. Because pigs have no experience in riding trains, they are prone to panic, so they take special care of them within the first 100 li of the journey; whenever the train is about to cross a bridge, pass through a tunnel, hitch a car, switch tracks, or sound the whistle, they first greet them, calling them gently, for fear that they will squeeze each other.
    In some places, live pigs must be transported by boat or tugboat. In some areas of Guangdong Province, pigs used to be loaded into bamboo baskets when transported by boat, and then the bamboo baskets were stacked on the boat like bags of grain; the pigs were afraid of being suffocated, and many died or were injured. Later, some places adopted new methods, installing "pig pens" on the deck, where the pigs were scattered; during the journey, they were often fed some refreshing and appetizing seasonings, such as sugar vinegar and mirabilite. The 264-kilometer voyage from Lian County to Lianjiangkou in Guangdong Province (which takes three or four days to a week) has had very good results after adopting this method. The China Food Company also plans to promote this experience in other areas where live pigs are transported by water.
    Many of the live pigs managed by state-owned food companies live in breeding farms for many days, so doing a good job in the management of breeding farms is also very important. The food company has many breeding farms for maintaining live pigs. The breeding farms are arranged in an orderly manner. There are pre-inspection pens in the farm, where newly arrived fat pigs first rest, have their temperature checked, and are disinfected. Later, according to the different regions, sizes, strengths, and characteristics, they are classified and introduced into the pig pens. Sick pigs are separately introduced into recuperation pens and high-temperature pens for isolation and feeding according to the severity of their condition and whether they are contagious. The breeders often study the feed formulation, nutritional composition, pig appetite, etc., so that each pig can eat appropriate feed. They also take turns on duty, so that "people do not leave the pen." If they find a sick pig, they ask a veterinarian to check and treat it at any time; most of the breeders also have general knowledge of epidemic prevention and hygiene. They often clean the pig pens, do a major cleaning every seven days, wash them every three days, and often disinfect them with medicinal solutions.
    In recent years, thanks to their efforts, the mortality rate of pigs has gradually decreased. The mortality rate of pigs in 1955 has dropped from 2.4% in 1954 to 0.68%, and in 1956 it was only 0.16%. Compared with 1954, a total of 830,000 fewer fat pigs died in the past two years, enough for 8 million people to eat for a year (calculated according to the national average consumption of pork per person per year).
    Purchasing, transporting, and raising live pigs is a commonplace and arduous task. However, many business people understand the importance of managing live pigs and love their work. Pan Rui, the person in charge of the first live pig warehouse in Hunan Province, said: "I don't want to leave the live pig warehouse anymore, I want to do it for the rest of my life." They are determined to do their job even better.

    不要忘记经营生猪的人们
    为了使人们吃到更多的猪肉，他们付出了多少辛勤的劳动！	赵及棕
    春节里，当你吃到美味的猪肉的时候，请你不要忘记食品公司经营生猪的人员们的辛勤劳动。
    中国食品公司在全国各地经营着大量的生猪。猪，说起来不是很难摆弄的；但是，要使每一头猪都长得很肥，不害病，在长途押运中也不受损失，却不是一件容易的事。
    1954年，食品公司经营生猪一千四百四十五万头，因为没有经验，猪的死亡率很高，全年死了三十多万头。经营生猪的人员，想到在他们手下死了这么多猪，真不忍心，下定决心要为消灭猪的死亡而奋斗。
    为了减少猪的死亡，他们特别注意改进押运生猪的工作；使猪在押运途中无论是走旱路，或乘汽车、火车、木船、轮船……，都能过着很安全的生活，吃得好、喝得好、睡得好。许多猪在路上还长了肉呢！
    要把猪从甲地送到乙地去，经旱路押运是最方便而又节约的。河南省沈丘县食品公司的工作人员，摸索出了在旱路上押运生猪的好经验，猪在途中死的很少。押运前，他们把精神饱满的、身体大小差不多的、蹄爪端正的挑出来专供押运外调用；剩下的供应当地市场。在押运途中，做到“慢赶勤歇”、“定时定程”：赶五里路休息五分钟，十里路休息十分钟，十五里路休息半小时，每日最多行程二十五里至三十里；冬冷白天赶，夏热夜间赶，春秋两季不冷不热早晚赶、中午歇。猪群前面的一个人是“领队”，他要面向猪群倒退走路，以便照顾猪群。每天给猪三顿熟食，定食定量，要保证个个猪都吃饱。住宿的时候，有人分班放哨照顾猪群，使猪在睡觉的时候不互相拥挤、咬架。有些押运员，每当要走山路的时候，便给猪穿上皮底布帮的鞋子，以免伤了它们的脚。
    用汽车、火车运猪的时候，押运员们就更辛苦了。肥猪不习惯上火车和走窄路，他们就先训练好“带头”猪，或用黑山羊在前面引路。在车上，他们不分昼夜地和猪同住在一个车上，保证猪不挨饿、不受渴，有熟食、净水吃。他们很讲究车上的卫生，常常打扫。发现有猪病了，就设法及时给治疗和照顾。有的甚至给发烧的猪洗澡擦背，洒冷水，或用人工风扇扇，以降低病猪的热度。猪没有坐火车的经验，容易惊慌，他们就在初开车的一百里以内，对它们加以特别照顾；每当火车要过桥、过洞、挂车、调车、鸣笛的时候，就先向它们打招呼，轻轻地唤呼，怕它们互相挤压。
    在有些地方，须用木船、拖轮押运生猪。广东省有些地区，过去用船运猪的时候，先把猪装在竹篓里，以后就把竹篓像垛粮食袋子一样地堆在船上；猪怕闷，死伤的很多。以后，有些地方就采取新方法，在船面上装“猪圈”，猪散放在猪圈里；在途中，还经常给它们喂些清火开胃的调味品，如糖醋、皮硝等。广东省连县到连江口长达二百六十四公里的航程（需航行三、四天到一星期），采用这方法以后效果很好。中国食品公司还计划在其他有水运生猪的地区推广这样的经验。
    国营食品公司经营的活猪，有很多日子生活在饲养场里，因此，做好饲养场的管理工作，也是很重要的。食品公司有很多保养生猪的饲养场。饲养场排列得井井有条。场内有预检栏，新来的肥猪先在这里休息、检查体温、消毒。以后，按地区、大小、强弱、特性的不同，分类引进猪圈。对于病猪，就按病情轻重、是否传染等分别引入休养圈、高温圈隔离饲养。饲养员经常研究饲料的调配、营养成分、猪的食欲等等，使每只猪都能吃到适当的饲料。他们还轮流值班，做到“人不离圈”。发现有病猪，就随时请兽医检查治疗；多数的饲养员也都具有一般的防疫卫生知识。他们经常打扫猪圈，七天大扫除一次，三天冲洗一次，还常用药水消毒。
    近几年来，在他们的努力下，猪的死亡率日渐降低。1955年猪的死亡率已由1954年的2.4％降到0.68％，1956年仅有0.16％了。同1954年相比，近两年共少死八十三万头肥猪，够八百万人吃一年（按全国每人每年平均吃猪肉的斤数计算）。
    收购、押运、饲养生猪，是平凡而艰苦的工作。可是，许多商业人员都懂得经营生猪的重要，热爱着自己的工作。湖南省第一生猪仓库的负责人潘瑞说：“我再也不想离开生猪仓库了，我要干它一辈子。”他们决心把自己的工作做得更好。
