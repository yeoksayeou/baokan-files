    A Model Unit for Settling Demobilized Soldiers
    The Harbin Linen Textile Factory is one of the model units in Harbin for settling demobilized soldiers. Currently, there are more than 470 disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized soldiers working in this factory, accounting for about 20% of the total number of employees. Thanks to the factory's proper resettlement and active training of demobilized soldiers, the vast majority of them have become familiar with their jobs. Even among the 115 demobilized soldiers settled in 1956, 87 have already become skilled technical workers. Among the demobilized soldiers, two have been promoted to foremen, and six have been promoted to workshop directors, deputy foremen, and cleaning team leaders. Over 95% of the demobilized soldiers have played a backbone role in production and work.
    Each time this factory receives a batch of demobilized soldiers, it adheres to the principles of proper resettlement, making the best use of their talents, and ensuring everyone gets what they are suited for, when arranging jobs for the demobilized soldiers. Those with a certain level of education are assigned to be clerks, and those who are young, strong, and have the potential for development are placed on the machines to learn technology. The opinions of each person are sought when assigning jobs.
    After the job assignments, the leadership also frequently goes deep into the workshops to understand their work, thinking, health, and other aspects. If any improper arrangements are found, they are adjusted appropriately based on production needs and the specific conditions of the demobilized soldiers. For example, demobilized soldier Zhao Shufang was initially assigned to do drawing work, but after learning that she was physically weak and had a high school education, she was transferred to be a clerk. When assigning jobs to Guo Wei, Wu Meilan, Li Cai, and others, the leadership considered that they were young and could be trained to become skilled technical workers, so they were assigned to the workshop to learn technology; however, it was later discovered that Guo Wei suffered from neurasthenia, and Wu Meilan and Li Cai both suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, making them unsuitable for working on the machines in the workshop, so they were reassigned to do lighter work.

    一个安置复员军人的模范单位
    哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂是哈尔滨市安置复员军人的模范单位之一。现在在这个厂工作的革命残废军人、复员军人有四百七十多名，约占全厂职工总数的20％。由于厂里对复员军人进行了妥善安置，并积极培养，绝大多数复员军人已经熟悉了自己的业务。就是在1956年安置的一百十五名复员军人中，也已经有八十七名成为熟练的技术工人。在复员军人中被提拔为工长的有两名，提拔为车间主任、副工长及擦车队长的有六名。95％以上的复员军人在生产中，在工作中发挥了骨干作用。
    这个厂每接收一批复员军人，都本着妥善安置、人尽其才、各得其所的原则，安排复员军人的工作。对有一定文化水平的都分配做职员，凡年轻力壮、有培养前途的，都放在机台上学技术。在分配工作时都分别征求了每个人的意见。
    在分配工作以后，领导方面还经常深入车间了解他们的工作、思想、身体健康等各方面的情况，发现有安置不当的，就根据生产需要和复员军人的具体条件进行适当的调整。如对复员军人赵淑芳，最初分配做并条工作，后来了解到她的身体弱，又有高小文化程度，便调她当职员。在分配郭伟、吴梅兰、李财等人的工作时，领导方面考虑到他们年纪轻，可以培养成为熟练的技术工人，便分配到车间学技术；但以后发现郭伟有神经衰弱病，吴梅兰和李财都患有风湿性关节炎，都不适合在车间机台上工作，于是又重新分配他们做较轻的工作。
