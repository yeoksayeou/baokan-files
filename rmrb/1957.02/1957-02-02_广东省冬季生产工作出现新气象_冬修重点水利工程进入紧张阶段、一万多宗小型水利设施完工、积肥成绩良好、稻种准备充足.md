The recent mission of over five thousand cadres (including the Deputy Governor, heads of departments, CCP prefectural committee secretaries, county committee members, etc.) to Guangdong Province has strengthened the grassroots leadership in rural areas and widely promoted the superiority of agricultural cooperativization, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses for production. A new atmosphere has emerged in winter production across the countryside.

Some time ago, the momentum of winter production in most parts of Guangdong Province was not as strong as last year. Many people only saw the shortcomings of collectivization and technological reforms, failing to recognize the major achievements. Especially after opening up the free market and advocating the development of sideline production, some farmers lost interest in agricultural production and were keen on sideline or commercial activities that yielded higher temporary income. After criticizing subjectivism, bureaucratism, and coercive commandism in the previous period, many rural cadres were hesitant and dared not mobilize the masses for production. In addition, the mutual benefit policies were not well implemented in some areas, and central tasks such as rectification of cooperatives, general elections, and conscription were not well integrated with production, causing winter production to stagnate for a while. Basic farmland construction was delayed, and many winter crops were yellowing and withering due to lack of fertilizer.

After large numbers of cadres went deep into the rural areas, they ate, lived, and worked with the masses. Some cadres took off their shoes and went into the fields, helping farmers accumulate fertilizer and carry manure. Some cadres continued to persevere even with swollen shoulders. The confidence of grassroots cadres in leading production has increased. The enthusiasm of the masses for production has grown. In the past, some commune members were unwilling to go to work until late in the morning, but now they go out before dawn and are unwilling to stop working until it is dark.

At present, most areas of Guangdong Province have initially formed a large-scale production upsurge. 80% of the key water conservancy projects under winter repair in the province have entered a tense construction phase, and more than 10,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy facilities have been completed or are about to be completed. The crash accumulation of fertilizer has also achieved good results. In the five counties of Chao'an, Chenghai, Chaoyang, Jieyang, and Puning, which had previously achieved the title of "1,000-jin grain counties," most agricultural cooperatives have prepared the base fertilizer for the early rice crop. At the end of January last year, the area of ​​fallow fields ploughed in winter and the area of ​​destroyed rice roots in the province was only more than 12 million mu, but now it has exceeded more than 14 million mu. Winter crops in most areas have also been cultivated, weeded, and top-dressed with fertilizer. After strengthening field management, most of the previously poorly growing sweet potatoes and wheat are now expected to increase production. The rice seeds needed for spring ploughing throughout the province are also basically sufficiently prepared. (Li Shaoqiu)

    广东省冬季生产工作出现新气象
    冬修重点水利工程进入紧张阶段、一万多宗小型水利设施完工、积肥成绩良好、稻种准备充足
    本报讯　最近二十多天以来，广东省先后派出了五千多名干部（包括副省长、厅长、中共地委书记、县委委员等）下乡，加强农村基层领导的力量，广泛宣传农业合作化的优越性，大大地鼓舞了群众生产的热情，农村的冬季生产普遍出现了新的气象。
    前些时候，广东省大部分地区冬季生产的劲头不如去年。不少群众仅仅看到办社和技术改革中的缺点，而看不到主要的成绩。特别是在开放自由市场，提倡发展副业生产以后，有些农民对农业生产不感兴趣，热衷于临时收入多的副业或商业活动。不少农村干部在前一段时期经过批判主观主义、官僚主义和强迫命令的作风以后，表现束脚束手，不敢发动群众搞生产。加上部分地区对互利政策执行得不好，整社、普选、征兵等中心工作同生产又结合得不好，使得冬季生产曾经一时停滞不前，农田基本建设迟迟未动工，许多冬种作物因缺肥而黄萎。
    各地大批干部深入农村以后，和群众同食、同住、同劳动。有些干部脱鞋下田，帮助农民积肥挑粪，有的干部肩膀挑肿了，仍然坚持下去。基层干部领导生产的信心提高了。群众搞生产的劲头大了。过去有些社员日上三竿还不愿出工，现在天不亮就出去，天黑了还不愿收工。
    目前，广东省大部分地区已经初步形成了规模较大的生产高潮。全省冬修的重点水利工程，已经有80％进入紧张的施工阶段，有一万多宗小型农田水利设施已经完工或即将完工。突击积肥工作也获得良好成绩。曾经获得粮食千斤县的潮安、澄海、潮阳、揭阳、普宁等五县，大部分农业社的早造基肥已经准备好了。去年1月底全省休闲田翻土犁冬和挖毁稻根的面积只有一千二百多万亩，现在已经超过一千四百多万亩。大部分地区的冬种作物也已经中耕除草、追施了肥料，以前生长不好的甘薯、小麦经过加强田间管理以后，现在大多数可望增产。全省春耕所需要的稻种也基本上准备充足。　（李少球）
