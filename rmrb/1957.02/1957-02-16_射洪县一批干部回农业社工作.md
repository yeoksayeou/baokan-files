Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 13th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Song He and Yu Quanyu report: Yesterday, the leading organs of Shehong County, Sichuan Province, approved the requests of 132 township cadres who had previously worked in agricultural cooperatives, allowing them to return to their original agricultural cooperatives to work. After listening to the farewell remarks from the person in charge of the Shehong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, these township cadres happily shouldered their luggage and set off to return to their respective cooperatives. At the same time, four leading cadres from county-level organs were also approved to go to work in the townships.

Of the existing six hundred-plus township cadres in Shehong County, approximately three hundred were transferred from the positions of directors, deputy directors, and cadres of agricultural cooperatives. They had previously performed well in the agricultural cooperatives, and the cooperative members hoped they would return to continue leading the agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, many township organizations were overlapping and overstaffed. These cadres felt stifled and had long requested to return to lead production.

Zhang Ziwei, First Secretary of the Shehong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, told reporters: In addition to the 132 township cadres who were approved to return to their cooperatives today, the remaining one hundred-plus township cadres who have requested to return to their cooperatives will also be sent back in batches in the coming months. Their current work will be taken over by the cadres who remain and a small number of cadres transferred from county-level organs, and this will not be affected. However, many agricultural cooperatives lacking leadership backbone can be enriched as a result.

Dong Mingshan, Civil Affairs Commissioner of Guangsheng Township, was originally the director of the well-known Qiulin Agricultural Cooperative in the township. He said excitedly: “Being able to leave the office and return to work in my own cooperative is truly wonderful. When I return, I will immediately mobilize the cooperative members to implement our original plan for expanding production. I have calculated that after this plan is completed, the total income of the entire cooperative this year will increase by more than 20% compared to last year.”

    射洪县一批干部回农业社工作
    据新华社成都13日电　新华社记者宋禾、喻权域报道：昨天，四川省射洪县的领导机关批准了一百三十二名曾经在农业社里工作过的乡干部的请求，让他们回到原来的农业社去工作。这些乡干部在听了中共射洪县委负责人的送行话后，便背起行李高高兴兴地分别动身回自己的合作社去。与此同时，四名县级机关的领导干部也被批准到乡上去工作。
    射洪县现有的六百多名乡干部中，约有三百人是从农业社的主任、副主任和干部中抽调上来的。他们原来在农业社里工作很好，社员盼望他们回去继续领导农业社。同时，许多乡里机构重叠，人浮于事，这批干部感到沉闷，早就要求回去领导生产。
    中共射洪县委第一书记张子伟对记者说：除去今天被批准回社的一百三十二名乡干部外，其余一百多名要求回社的乡干部也将在今后几个月中分批回去。他们现在的工作由留下的干部和一小部分县级机关下放去的干部担任，不会受影响。而许多缺乏领导骨干的农业社，却能因此得到充实。
    广生乡民政委员董明善原是全乡著名的丘林农业社的主任。他兴奋地说：“能够走出办公室回到本社去工作，真是太好了。我回去要马上发动社员把我们原来拟订的扩大生产的计划实行起来。我计算过，这个计划完成后，全社今年的总收入会比去年提高20％以上。”
