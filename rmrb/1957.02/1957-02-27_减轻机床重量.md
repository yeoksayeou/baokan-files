Reducing Machine Tool Weight

    (From our newspaper) The Shenyang Third Machine Tool Factory, in improving machine tool design, successfully tested an electric rapid traverse mechanism on a 1K36 lathe on January 20th. This is a power device that drives the tool holder for cutting.

    The previous transmission mechanism was composed of more than two hundred parts, including gears, seamless steel pipes, and ball bearings. Production was uneconomical and increased the weight of the machine tool. Last November, the factory's design department began to improve the design of this mechanism. Considering saving steel, reducing auxiliary man-hours, and improving machine tool performance, they referred to the advantages of similar devices in advanced machine tools in the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. They boldly eliminated one hundred and sixty expensive parts, such as seamless steel pipes and ball bearings, from the original design, and used a 0.6 kW motor and a small gearbox to undertake the transmission of all the gears in the past. After testing, it was proven that the weight of each machine tool was reduced by 130 kilograms, and the cost was also reduced by about 300 yuan. Moreover, because the parts are simple, operation, inspection, and maintenance are more convenient than before. (Text)

    减轻机床重量
    本报讯　沈阳第三机床厂在改进机床设计中，1月20日试验成功一种装置在1K36车床上的电动快速移动机构，它是一种带动刀架进行切削加工的动力装置。
    过去的传动机构是由齿轮、无缝钢管、滚珠等二百多种零件组成的，生产起来既不经济，同时也增加了机床的体重。去年11月，工厂设计科就开始改进这一机构设计，他们从节约钢材，减少辅助工时，提高机床性能等三方面，参考了苏联和资本主义国家先进机床类似装置的优点，大胆地取消了原有设计中的无缝钢管、滚珠等一百六十种贵重零件，以一个零点六瓩的马达和小变速箱承担了过去全部齿轮的传动装置。经过试验证明：每台机床体重减轻了一百三十公斤，成本也降低了三百元左右，而且由于零件简单，操作、检查、维修都比过去方便。　（文）
