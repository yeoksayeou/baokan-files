Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 3rd - Cairo newspapers reported on February 2nd that King Ahmad of Yemen said at a press conference held in Sukna, Libya, on February 1st, that all areas under the name of "British Aden Protectorate" belong to Yemen.

The area of the "Aden Protectorate" is estimated at 290,000 square kilometers, and the population is estimated at 650,000.

He condemned Britain for deliberately obstructing various solutions proposed to resolve the border issue. He also said that he believes the reason Britain is obstructing the resolution of the border issue is because these areas are rich in oil, and the imperialist countries want to seize the oil there.

Ahmad said that the only way to solve these problems is for Britain to stop its despicable attempt to separate these areas from their motherland.

He stated that if Britain does not change its attitude, he will submit the disputes between Yemen and Britain to the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - Cairo dispatch: Yemen's Envoy to Egypt, Abu Taleb, said on February 1st that refugees from the British "Aden Protectorate" are still fleeing to Yemen in a continuous stream.

Taleb said: "To date, there are a total of 40,000 refugees, all of whom have come to (Yemen) from Aden due to Britain's continued attacks on peaceful residents." He pointed out: "The number of refugees proves that the residents of Aden are resisting and proves that they are dissatisfied with British rule."

    也门国王艾哈迈德说
    “亚丁保护地”全部属于也门
    亚丁居民不满英国统治纷纷逃往也门
    新华社开罗3日电　开罗报纸2日报道，也门国王艾哈迈德2月1日在利比亚的苏克纳举行的记者招待会上说，在“英国的亚丁保护地”名义下的所有地区都是属于也门的。
    “亚丁保护地”的面积估计为二十九万平方公里，人口估计为六十五万人。
    他谴责英国故意阻挠为解决边境问题而提出的各种解决办法。他还说，他认为，英国阻挠解决边境问题的原因是这些地区的石油丰富，而帝国主义国家想要攫取那里的石油。
    艾哈迈德说，解决这些问题的唯一办法就是英国停止它想把这些地区从它们的祖国割裂出来的卑鄙企图。
    他表示，如果英国不改变它的态度的话，他就要把也门和英国之间的纠纷提交联合国。
    新华社2日讯　开罗消息：也门驻埃及公使阿布·塔列布2月1日说，来自英国的“亚丁保护地”的难民仍源源不断地逃往也门。
    塔列布说：“这些难民到现在为止一共有四万人，他们都是由于英国对和平居民继续不断地发动进攻而从亚丁来到（也门）的。”他指出：“难民的数目证明了亚丁的居民正在反抗，证明他们不满英国的统治。”
