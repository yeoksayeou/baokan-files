Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 7th. The All India Radio broadcast on the evening of February 6th Premier Zhou Enlai’s broadcast speech to the people of India at Calcutta Airport on February 5th on his way back to China from Ceylon. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Dear Indian friends,

My colleagues and I have concluded our visits to various Asian countries and are on our way back to China. I am honored to have been invited by All India Radio to say a few words to all my friends in India here in Calcutta.

First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to the Indian government and the Indian people. I not only want to thank you for the warm and grand welcome you gave us during our visit to India, but also for the warm and thoughtful hospitality you extended to us during our four transits through India while visiting other countries. Every stay in India makes us feel like we are at a relative's home, and makes us realize the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Indian people.

The desire to seek friendship, seek peace, and seek knowledge has been realized. We will strengthen friendship and cooperation with the people of Asian countries and learn from Asian countries.

We visited India and other Asian countries with the purpose of seeking friendship, seeking peace, and seeking knowledge. Now, as we return, we can say with satisfaction that our wishes have been fulfilled.

In every country we visited, we received moving welcomes. In these welcomes, we saw the development of friendship between the people of one country and the people of another, and also saw the development of friendship between the people of Asian countries. In all the countries we visited, we saw the people's strong desire for peace and friendship, and for expanding cooperation with each other. At the same time, we also saw that although Asian countries are generally relatively backward, each country, whether large or small, has its own outstanding advantages and strengths that are worth learning from by other countries. The isolation caused by colonialism in the past for a long time has made us lack a good understanding of each other and unable to learn from each other well. Now we have the desire to do so, and we also have the conditions to do so. If we Asian countries adhere to peace and friendship and strive to learn from each other, we will definitely be able to make valuable contributions to promoting world peace and cooperation, and we will definitely be able to promote our respective economic and cultural development.

After our visit, I believe that the Chinese government and the Chinese people will make further efforts to strengthen our friendship with the people of Asian countries, strengthen our cooperation with Asian countries, and strengthen our learning from Asian countries.

Asia is beginning a new and vibrant period. Colonialists are still struggling desperately, but they are doomed to fail.

During our visit, we visited many historical sites, which reminded us of Asia's glorious past. In the dawn of human history, we created our own great culture. Over the long years, we have accumulated countless valuable heritages. This historical glory cannot be erased even after colonialist aggression and occupation. It is a testament to the great creativity of the Asian people. It constitutes our excellent tradition that we will always cherish, and it inspires us to strive to build a new and happy Asia.

We have also seen Asia today. Many countries that were once reduced to foreign colonies or under foreign control have gained independence. The people of these countries demand to consolidate their political independence and are carrying out construction to strive for economic independence. The people of these countries all demand a peaceful international environment and demand to restore and develop our historical ties. To realize this strong demand, great efforts have been made and preliminary results have been achieved. Asia is beginning a new and vibrant period today, and the people of Asian countries are moving forward with full confidence in the cause of peace, independence, and freedom they are engaged in.

We have noticed that colonialists are still struggling desperately, trying to maintain and expand their special interests. Serious struggles must be waged to take back every right that originally belonged to us from their hands. But on the whole, colonialism is definitely tending towards decline, and its temporary rampage cannot change this doomed fate. As long as we Asian people remain vigilant and persist in the struggle to safeguard independence and freedom, the colonialists' struggle is destined to fail.

We have also noticed that there are not no differences and disputes between the newly independent Asian countries, especially because the colonialists have left us with many problems that cause us pain today. However, we believe that these problems can be resolved through peaceful negotiations. In any case, these differences and disputes should not hinder our unity, let alone allow colonialists to create discord and provoke conflicts. In fact, several such problems have been satisfactorily resolved by the countries concerned in a spirit of mutual understanding. We hope and believe that this spirit will continue to develop. We must transform Asia, where colonialists once created countless disputes and conflicts, into a big family where all Asian countries live in harmony.

The Five Principles and the Bandung Spirit will eventually overcome all imperialist plots of aggression and interference.

During our visit, we also noticed that the Five Principles—Panchsheel—first proposed by China and India, have been widely supported and have begun to be applied to the mutual relations of many countries. At the same time, I would like to repeat what I once said in the Indian Parliament: "The Bandung Spirit has not withered," and its influence is expanding. The failure of the imperialist aggression against Egypt is a clear proof. We firmly believe that the Five Principles first advocated by China and India and the Ten Principles declared at the Bandung Conference will eventually overcome all imperialist plots of aggression and interference.

After visiting so many Asian countries, we are even more aware of the importance of friendship between China and India. The cooperation between China and India in supporting national independence and safeguarding world peace plays an important role in stabilizing the situation in Asia and the world. I firmly believe that the people of our two countries will realize their responsibility to Asia and the world and make the necessary efforts.

Dear Indian friends, goodbye. We will return with your goodwill and friendship, and with the goodwill and friendship of the people of all the countries we have visited. We Chinese people will always adhere to the unity of the people of China and India and the unity of the people of Asian countries. We believe that this is an important guarantee that we can win peace and carry out the construction of our respective countries.

Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai (Indians and Chinese are brothers)!

Panchsheel Zindabad (Long live the Five Principles)!

Shanti Zindabad (Long live peace)!

### 把亚洲变成一个友好相处的大家庭  周总理回国途中在加尔各答发表广播演说

    把亚洲变成一个友好相处的大家庭
    周总理回国途中在加尔各答发表广播演说
    新华社新德里7日电　全印广播电台在6日晚间广播了周恩来总理2月5日从锡兰回国途中在加尔各答机场上向全印度人民发表的广播演说。这篇演说的全文如下：亲爱的印度朋友们：
    我和我的同事们已经结束了在亚洲各国的访问，正在回到中国去的路上；承蒙全印广播电台的邀请，我现在在加尔各答向全印度的朋友们讲几句话。
    我首先要乘这个机会，向印度政府和印度人民表示衷心的感谢。我不但要感谢在我们访问印度的时候，你们所给予我们的热烈而盛大的欢迎；我还要感谢在我们访问其他国家期间四次路过印度的时候，你们所给予我们的亲切而周到的招待。在印度的每一次逗留都使我们感到像到了亲戚家里一样，使我们体会到中印两国人民兄弟般的友谊。
    寻求友谊、寻求和平、寻求知识的愿望已经实现。我们将加强同亚洲各国人民的友谊、合作，向亚洲各国学习。
    我们是抱着寻求友谊、寻求和平、寻求知识的目的，访问印度和其他亚洲国家的。现在，当我们回去的时候，我们可以满意地说，我们的愿望已经实现了。
    无论到哪一个国家，我们都受到了令人感动的欢迎。在这种欢迎中，我们看到了一个国家的人民对另一个国家的人民的友谊在发展，也看到了亚洲各国人民的友谊在发展。在所有我们到过的国家中，我们都看到了人民要求和平和友好、要求扩大彼此合作的强烈愿望。同时，我们也看到，虽然亚洲国家一般说来是比较落后的，但是每一个国家，不论是大是小，都有各自突出的优点和长处，值得其他国家学习。殖民主义势力在过去长时期内造成的隔离状态，使我们相互之间缺乏很好的了解，也不能很好地学习。现在我们有了这样做的愿望，也有了这样做的条件。我们亚洲各国如果坚持和平友好，努力相互学习，一定能够对于促进世界和平和合作，作出有价值的贡献，并且一定能够促进我们各自的经济和文化的发展。
    在我们的这次访问以后，我相信，中国政府和中国人民将进一步努力，加强我们同亚洲各国人民的友谊，加强我们同亚洲各国的合作，并且加强我们向亚洲各国的学习。
    亚洲正在开始一个新的生气勃勃的时期。殖民主义者还在拼命挣扎，但它是注定要失败的。
    我们在这次访问中，曾经参观了许多历史遗迹，它们使我们想到亚洲的辉煌的过去。我们在人类历史的黎明时期，就创造了自己伟大的文化。在悠久的岁月中，我们曾经积累了无数宝贵的遗产。这种历史的光辉，即使经过殖民主义的侵略和占领，也不能够被磨灭掉。它是亚洲人民伟大的创造力的证明。它构成了我们所永远珍爱的优良传统，而且鼓舞着我们努力建设一个新的、幸福的亚洲。
    我们也看到了亚洲的今天。许多曾经沦为外国殖民地或者处于外国控制下的国家，已经取得了独立。这些国家的人民，都要求巩固自己在政治上的独立，并且正在进行建设，争取经济上的独立。这些国家的人民都要求有一个和平的国际环境，都要求恢复和发展我们的历史联系。为了实现这种强烈的要求，已经作出了巨大的努力，并且已经取得初步的效果。亚洲今天正在开始一个新的生气勃勃的时期，亚洲各国人民，对自己所从事的和平、独立和自由的事业，正充满着信心在前进。
    我们注意到，殖民主义者还在拼命挣扎，企图保持和扩张他们的特殊利益。从他们手里夺回每一点本来属于我们的权利，都必须要进行严重的斗争。但是整个说来，殖民主义已经肯定地趋向衰亡，它的暂时的猖獗并不能改变这种注定的命运。只要我们亚洲各国人民保持警惕，坚持维护独立和自由的斗争，殖民主义的挣扎是注定要失败的。
    我们也注意到，在新近取得独立的亚洲国家之间并不是没有分歧和争端的，特别是因为殖民主义者曾经给我们留下了许多今天使我们痛苦的问题。但是，我们认为这些问题可以用和平谈判的方法求得解决。无论如何，这些分歧和争端不应该妨碍我们之间的团结，更不应该容许殖民主义者从中制造是非，挑起冲突。事实上，已经有若干这样的问题，由有关国家以相互谅解的精神，达成了圆满的解决。我们希望而且相信这种精神将会继续得到发展。我们一定要把殖民主义者曾经在这里制造了无数的争端和冲突的亚洲，变成为一个所有亚洲国家友好相处的大家庭。
    五项原则和万隆精神终将战胜一切帝国主义的侵略和干涉的阴谋。
    在我们的访问中，我们还注意到，由中国和印度首先倡议的五项原则——潘查希拉，已经得到广泛的支持，而且已经开始应用到许多国家的相互关系中去。同时，我还愿再重复一遍我曾经在印度国会中讲过的话：“万隆精神并没有枯萎”，它的影响正在扩大。帝国主义者对埃及的侵略的失败就是一个明证。我们深信，中印两国所首倡的五项原则和万隆会议所宣布的十项原则终将战胜一切帝国主义的侵略和干涉的阴谋。
    在我们访问了这么多的亚洲国家以后，我们更加感到中国和印度的友谊的重要。中国和印度在支持民族独立和维护世界和平的事业中的合作，对于稳定亚洲和世界的局势，有着重要的作用。我深信，我们两国人民将会意识到自己对亚洲和世界的责任而作出必要的努力。
    亲爱的印度朋友们，再见了，我们将带着你们的善意和友谊，带着我们所访问过的各国人民的善意和友谊回去。我们中国人民将永远坚持中印两国人民的团结和亚洲各国人民的团结。我们相信，这将是我们能够赢得和平、能够进行我们各自国家建设的一个重要保证。
    印地秦尼巴依巴依（中印人民是兄弟）！
    潘查希拉秦达巴（五项原则万岁）！
    香底秦达巴（和平万岁）！
