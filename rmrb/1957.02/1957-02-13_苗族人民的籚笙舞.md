    The Reed Pipe Dance of the Miao People
    Xiaofeng

    I remember when I was working in the Miao areas of northern Guangxi and southern Guizhou, the thing that interested me the most was watching the Miao people's reed pipe dance. On cold, windy nights, I would stand in the open field watching the reed pipe dance, not wanting to go back until late at night.

    The musical instrument for the reed pipe dance – the reed pipe – is divided into three sizes: large, medium, and small. The large ones are made of large bamboo branches and can be as tall as ten to twenty feet. The medium ones are three to seven feet, and the small ones are three to five inches. The small reed pipe is played by the conductor of the reed pipe band to direct the entire band's performance. Therefore, the small reed pipe is not only accurate and clear in its notes and scales, but also exquisitely beautiful in style. In addition, there is an auxiliary instrument for the reed pipe band, which consists of a musical pipe inserted into a long, large bamboo tube. When played, it only emits a simple humming sound as a harmony to the large reed pipes. This is called the "sounding tube."

    The main form of the reed pipe dance is the reed pipe band dance. This involves dozens of reed pipes of various sizes forming a band, performing collective playing and dancing. Before each collective playing and dancing session, each participant carries a reed pipe. Those playing the large reed pipes stand in the middle, those playing the medium reed pipes form a circle around them. If the reed pipe band is large, then another circle or two can be formed outside, layering and surrounding the large reed pipes in the middle. The small reed pipes are generally in the inner circle, but sometimes they are also in the second circle or outside the circle. When the playing begins, the conductor of the reed pipe band first plays an overture on the small reed pipe. This small overture is crisp, melodious, and moving. The player waves the reed pipe, and the body and feet move rhythmically with the music. As the overture is about to end, the small reed pipe player suddenly leaps up. Then, all the various reed pipes forming a large circle begin to play simultaneously, and the players also dance the reed pipe dance in unison. When hundreds of reed pipes of various sizes play together, the earth-shattering, enormous sound creates a momentum like overturning mountains and seas, or ten thousand horses galloping, causing mountain echoes in the mountains and valleys, and shaking people's heartstrings. If someone is hearing the reed pipe music and watching the reed pipe dance for the first time, they will surely be so surprised by this magnificent sound that their eyes will be wide open. As the music goes from high to low, the dancers' movements also change from rapid left and right rotations to slow left and right rotations. The players and dancers are generally young and middle-aged men, and their rhythmic, uniform dance gives the impression of being: majestic, lively, and graceful. As the collective dance is about to end, the music rises again from low to high, and all the players leap up in unison, then stop moving, which marks the end. This collective playing and dancing sometimes takes the form of a competition between two teams. The process is similar to the above, except that the two teams each form a circle, playing and dancing simultaneously, allowing impartial people and the audience to judge. The reed pipe band with the loudest sound, clear rhythm, and graceful and uniform dance postures is considered the winning team.

    Another form of dance, called "stepping on the reed pipe" in the Miao language. The people who play the reed pipe do not participate in the dance, they only provide musical accompaniment for the dance. The dancers are mostly young Miao girls. Since this dance is generally performed during the annual "Spring Festival" of the Miao people, with a large audience, the Miao girls participating in the dance try to dress as beautifully as possible. They wear silver hairpins and various beautiful feathers such as white, yellow, and green in their hair, and large dangling silver earrings on their ears. They wear circles and circles of silver necklaces and many silver ornaments such as small silver knives and silver locks around their necks, and new embroidered clothes and skirts on their bodies. They are truly dressed extremely beautifully. When the grand reed pipes on the square play a melodious dance tune, they enter the arena in a file, raising their hands and sleeves to the rhythm of the music, moving their feet rhythmically, and dancing the "stepping on the reed pipe" dance around the reed pipes, advancing and retreating. The silver earrings, necklaces, and other jewelry they wear also move with the swaying of their graceful dance, making harmonious and pleasant jingling sounds, which further enhances the beautiful atmosphere of the "stepping on the reed pipe" dance.

    In the Miao-populated areas of Sanjiang in northern Guangxi and Liping in southern Guizhou, as well as in some Dong-populated areas, the reed pipe dance has become a popular mass recreational activity for the Miao people and some Dong people during the slack farming season. Every year after the harvest in winter, the villages invite reed pipe makers to the village. Families with young and middle-aged men order one or two reed pipe instruments. Almost every young and middle-aged man has a reed pipe, and almost every adult Miao man can play reed pipe music and dance the reed pipe band dance. Therefore, every time the reed pipe band dance is performed, all the young and middle-aged men in the village participate, and the rest of the men, women, old, and young watch and enjoy. When there are young girls participating in the "stepping on the reed pipe" dance, people from dozens of miles away come to admire it. That is even more lively.

    The reed pipe dance of the Miao people has a long history and is music and dance that the Miao people love to see and hear. It fully reflects the passionate and unrestrained character of the Miao people, and is a beautiful flower of art in our motherland's large family. However, before liberation, the Miao people were discriminated against and oppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, living a life of suffering, and the reed pipe dance activities gradually decreased and tended to decline. After liberation, the mass reed pipe dance has been widely developed. Now, every winter and early spring evening, the humming sound of reed pipes can be heard everywhere in the valleys of the Great Miao Mountains, and the shadowy dancing figures holding reed pipes high next to the bonfires can be seen, just as the ancient saying goes: "Everywhere there is singing and dancing, intoxicated by peace." From this, we can see the joy and richness of the lives of the people of our multinational motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party, and we can also see the prosperous atmosphere of our motherland today.

### 苗族人民的籚笙舞

    苗族人民的籚笙舞
    晓风
    我记得我在桂北黔南的苗族地区工作的时候，最使我感兴趣的事物，就是看苗族的籚笙舞。在寒风凛冽的晚上，我站在露天的场地上看籚笙舞，一直到深夜还不愿回去。
    籚笙舞的乐器——籚笙，分大中小三种。大的用大竹枝制成，高达一丈到二丈。中等的三尺到七尺，小的三寸到五寸。小籚笙是由籚笙队的指挥者吹奏以指挥整个籚笙队演奏的。因此小籚笙不仅音节、音阶准确而清楚，而且式样精巧美观。此外还有一种籚笙队的附属乐器，用一支乐管插在一个长形的大竹筒中，吹奏时只发出单纯嗡嗡的声音，作为大籚笙的和声，这叫响筒。
    籚笙舞的主要形式？是籚笙队舞，这是由几十枝大小籚笙组成的籚笙队进行集体的吹奏和舞蹈，当每次进行集体吹奏舞蹈前，参加舞蹈的人各携籚笙一枝，吹奏大籚笙的人站在中间，吹奏中籚笙的人，在他周围围成一圈，如果人数多的籚笙队则可以在圈外再围一圈两圈，层层地把大籚笙围在中间，小籚笙一般是在内圈，有时也有在第二圈内或者在圈外的。开始吹奏时由籚笙队的指挥者先用小籚笙吹奏一首序曲，这首小序曲，声音清脆委婉，娓娓动人。演奏者手舞籚笙，身子和脚也随着乐声而作有规律的转动。当序曲快将终了时，小籚笙的演奏者突然一跃而起。于是围成一个大圆圈的各种籚笙便同时吹奏起来，吹奏人也整齐一致地跳起籚笙舞来了。当百数十枝大小籚笙同时吹奏起来的时候，震天动地的巨大响声，声势有如排山倒海，万马奔腾，在万山丛中引起山鸣谷应，震撼着人们的心弦。如果初听籚笙曲、初看籚笙舞的人，必定会因为这个雄壮的巨大声音，而惊奇到瞪目结舌的。随着乐声的由高而低，吹奏的人们的舞蹈也由急骤的左右旋转变为缓步的左右旋转。吹奏兼舞蹈者一般都是青壮年的男人，在他们有节奏的、整齐一致的舞蹈中，给人的印象是：雄壮、活泼和优美。在集体舞蹈快要终了的时候，乐声又由低而高，全体吹奏者以同一步伐，一跃而起，然后停止动作便算结束了。这种集体吹奏和舞蹈有时也采取两队竞赛的形式。过程和上述差不多，不同的地方只是两队各围成一圈，同时吹奏和舞蹈，让公正人和观众来评选。吹奏声音响亮、节拍清楚，舞蹈姿势优美、整齐的籚笙队，就作为优胜队。
    另一种舞蹈形式，苗语叫“踏笙脚”。吹奏籚笙的人不参加跳舞，只作跳舞的乐器伴奏者。跳舞的人多半是年青的苗族姑娘。由于跳这种舞一般都是在苗族一年一度的“春社”节日，观众众多，因此参加跳舞的苗族姑娘都要尽量打扮得漂漂亮亮。她们都是头戴银钗，和插上白、黄、绿等各种美丽的羽毛，耳上戴上大坠的银耳环。颈项上挂上一圈又一圈的银颈圈和银小刀、银锁等许多银饰品，身上穿上绣花的新衣和新裙，打扮得真是美丽极了。当广场上的大籚笙奏起悠扬的舞曲的时候，她们便鱼贯进场，按着音乐的节拍，举手扬袖，双脚有规律地移动着，轻盈的步伐，绕着籚笙，一进一退地跳起“踏笙脚”舞来。她们身上挂的银耳环，颈圈等首饰也随着她们婀娜舞姿的摆动，而发出和谐悦耳的叮噹响声，这样就更增加了“踏笙脚”舞优美的气氛。
    在广西北部的三江和贵州南部的黎平一带，苗族聚居的地方，以及一部分侗族聚居的地方，籚笙舞成为苗族及一部分侗族人民农闲季节群众性的文娱活动，在每年冬季庄稼收获完毕后，各村寨便聘请制造籚笙的乐匠到村里来，凡是家有青壮年男人的人家，都订制一两枝籚笙乐器。凡是青壮年的男人几乎每人都有一枝籚笙，而且差不多每个成年的苗族男人都会吹奏籚笙曲，会跳籚笙队舞。因此每次跳籚笙队舞时全寨的青壮男人都出动参加，其余的男女老幼便在旁围观欣赏。有年青姑娘参加的踏笙脚舞，还会有数十里外的人赶来欣赏。那更是热闹了。
    苗族的籚笙舞，有悠久的历史，是苗族人民喜见乐闻的音乐和舞蹈。它充分反映出苗族人民热情豪放的性格，是我们祖国大家庭中一枝美丽的艺术之花。但是在解放前，苗族人民受到国民党反动派的歧视、压迫，过着痛苦的生活，籚笙舞的活动因而逐渐减少，且有衰退的趋势。解放后，群众性的籚笙舞才得到了广泛的发展。现在每年冬天和初春的晚上，在大苗山的山谷中处处都可以听到嗡嗡的籚笙音响，和看到在篝火旁边高举籚笙，影影绰绰的舞姿，真如古语所说的：“处处笙歌醉太平”。从这里看到在共产党领导下，我们多民族的祖国人民生活的欢乐和丰富多采，也看到了我们祖国今天的繁荣昌盛的气象。
