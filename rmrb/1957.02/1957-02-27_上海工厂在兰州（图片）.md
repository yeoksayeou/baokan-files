Shanghai Factories in Lanzhou

The joint state-private venture Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, the Lihua Ink Factory (one of the nationally renowned Minsheng brand ink manufacturers), and the Gongxing Glass Factory, which successively moved from Shanghai to Lanzhou in June of last year, are producing a large quantity of inexpensive and high-quality products to meet the needs of the people in Gansu and other regions. After these three factories moved to Lanzhou, they mostly used local raw materials for production and frequently contacted Shanghai factories to obtain production and technical assistance, ensuring the quality standards of their products.

    上海工厂在兰州
    去年6月从上海陆续迁来兰州的公私合营佛慈制药厂、全国著名的民生牌墨水加工厂之一的利华墨水厂、工兴玻璃厂，正在生产大量价廉物美的产品，供应甘肃等地人民需要。这三个厂迁来兰州后，大部分是用当地原料进行生产，并经常同上海各工厂联系，取得生产和技术上的帮助，保证了产品的质量标准。
