Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 21st: The Second National Congress of Vietnamese Literary and Art Workers opened in Hanoi yesterday. More than 470 literary and art workers from all parts of North Vietnam and South Vietnam attended the congress. The first congress was held in 1948.

Nguyen Tuan, Secretary-General of the Vietnam Literary and Art Association, explained in his opening speech that this congress would conduct a preliminary review of the literary and artistic movement since the August Revolution and propose work tasks and guidelines in the new environment.

Nguyen Dinh Thi, member of the Standing Committee of the Literary and Art Association and poet, delivered a general report on the Vietnamese literary and artistic movement at the meeting.

In his report, he pointed out that under the leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party, Vietnam's literary, musical, dance, fine arts, drama and other artistic departments have developed in recent years. Great achievements have also been made in launching mass literary and artistic movements, developing ethnic minority art, exploring national artistic heritage, and conducting international artistic exchanges.

In his report, Nguyen Dinh Thi also criticized some erroneous phenomena of detachment from life and politics existing in Vietnamese literary and art circles, as well as some tendencies of formalism, conceptualization, formalism, and naturalism that appeared in literary and artistic works.

Nguyen Dinh Thi emphatically refuted the bourgeois individualistic arguments put forward by some people in literary and art circles that literature and art should be separated from politics and the leadership of the Party. He said that these people also distorted the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy and developed bourgeois individualistic creative viewpoints in the field of literature and art. He pointed out that the weakness of theoretical work is the main reason for the shortcomings in literary and artistic work. He called on Vietnamese literary and art circles to strive to study Marxist-Leninist literary and art theories in the future.

Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Vietnam Labor Party, read out the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Labor Party to the congress at the afternoon meeting, calling on Vietnamese literary and art workers to work hard to study Marxist-Leninist theory, strengthen ideological transformation, immerse themselves in the lives of workers, peasants and soldiers, strengthen artistic cultivation, and strengthen unity in order to better serve the motherland and the people.

    越南第二届文艺大会开幕
    劳动党中央号召加强学习理论深入生活
    据新华社河内21日电　第二届越南全国文艺大会昨天在河内开幕。参加大会的有来自北越各地和南越的文学艺术工作者四百七十多人。第一届大会是在1948年召开的。
    越南文艺会总书记阮遵在开幕词中说明这次大会将对八月革命以来的文艺运动进行初步的回顾，并且提出在新的环境下的工作任务和方针。
    文艺会常务委员会委员、诗人阮廷诗在会上作了关于越南文艺运动的总报告。
    他在报告中指出，在越南劳动党的领导下，越南的文学、音乐、舞蹈、美术、戏剧等文艺部门几年来都有了发展。在展开群众性的文艺运动、发展少数民族文艺、发掘民族文艺遗产和进行国际文艺交流等方面也取得了很大成绩。
    阮廷诗在报告中也批评了存在于越南文艺界的某些脱离生活、脱离政治的错误现象和在文艺作品中出现的一些公式化、概念化、形式主义和自然主义的倾向。
    阮廷诗着重地批驳了文艺界中某些人提出的所谓文艺应该脱离政治和脱离党的领导的资产阶级个人主义的论调。他说，这些人还歪曲了“百花齐放”的方针，在文艺领域中发展资产阶级个人主义的创作观点。他指出，理论工作的薄弱是文艺工作中存在缺点的主要原因。他要求越南文艺界今后要努力学习马克思列宁主义的文艺理论。
    越南劳动党政治局委员长征在下午会议上向大会宣读了劳动党中央委员会给大会的贺信，号召越南文艺工作者努力学习马克思列宁主义理论，加强思想改造，深入工农兵的生活，加强艺术修养，加强团结，以便更好地服务于祖国和人民。
