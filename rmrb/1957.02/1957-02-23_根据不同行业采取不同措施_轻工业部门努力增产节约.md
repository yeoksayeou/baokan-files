Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: The Ministry of Light Industry is adopting various measures based on different industries to save raw materials and increase production. Eleven industries, including paper making, rubber shoes, and daily-use ceramics, can increase wealth by more than 110 million yuan this year compared to the original plan.

    The paper-making industry has decided to expand the acquisition of pulp raw materials from within 40 kilometers along the railway to within 60 kilometers, in order to alleviate the current tense situation of raw material supply and increase production. It is estimated that 2,000 tons of rags alone can be acquired. At the same time, it is planned to take measures to improve the yield of raw materials. Preliminary calculations show that 6,000 cubic meters of wood can be saved. In addition, by improving equipment utilization, 40,000 tons of pulp can be produced throughout the year. Furthermore, under the principle of ensuring product quality, appropriately increase the speed of paper making, reduce the rate of paper re-pulping, increase the finished product rate, and cut paper that does not meet large specifications into small specifications, which can increase paper production by 20,000 tons throughout the year.

    In the rubber shoe industry, the current utilization rate of canvas is 80% on average. It has been decided to promote the "sample shape mixed cutting method" throughout the industry. In this way, the utilization rate of canvas can be increased to more than 90%, and the saved canvas can be enough for 5.4 million pairs of cloth-surface rubber shoes. In addition, it is also planned to adopt methods such as adjusting the formula, using reinforcing agents and fillers with good performance, improving the vulcanization method, improving wear resistance, and improving process operations to improve the quality of rubber shoes and extend the service life of rubber shoes. It is required that the average wear time for various brands of sneakers reach 110 days for athletes. In this way, the national rubber shoe industry is equivalent to increasing the production of more than 15.5 million pairs of rubber shoes.

    In the leather industry, in addition to improving the utilization rate of leather, it is planned to promote the experience of splitting leather into layers in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Inner Mongolia, and other provinces and cities. The light leather that can be split is about 1.4 million pieces. The split leather is equivalent to an increase of 70,000 original pieces, totaling more than 1.2 million square feet, which can be used to make 80,000 suitcases or 350,000 pairs of leather shoes. Calculated only on the increased leather, it can create 600,000 yuan of wealth for the country.

    Industries such as daily-use ceramics, matches, fountain pens, pencils, and daily-use metal products have also formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy.

    根据不同行业采取不同措施
    轻工业部门努力增产节约
    据新华社22日讯　轻工业部根据不同行业采取多种措施，节省原材料增加产量。造纸、胶鞋、日用陶瓷等十一个行业，今年可以比原计划增加一亿一千多万元的财富。
    造纸行业决定由过去沿铁路四十公里以内收购纸浆原料扩大到在六十公里以内收购，以缓和今年原材料供应紧张局面，增加生产，预计仅破布一项就可以收购两千吨。同时，计划采取措施提高原料的收获率，初步计算节省木材六千立方公尺。加上提高设备利用率，全年可以增产纸浆四万吨。另外，在保证产品质量的原则下，适当提高抄速，降低纸的回抄率，提高成品率，将不合大规格的纸裁成小规格用纸，全年增产纸张两万吨。
    在胶鞋行业中，目前帆布的利用率平均是80％，决定在全行业中推广“样形混合裁断法”。这样，帆布的利用率就能提高到90％以上，节省下来的帆布可以够五百四十万双布面胶鞋使用。此外还计划采取调整配方，采用性能好的补强剂和填充剂，改进硫化方法，提高耐磨耗性能以及改进工艺操作等方法，提高胶鞋的质量，延长胶鞋穿着寿命。要求各种牌号的球鞋平均达到运动员穿着一百一十天。这样全国胶鞋行业就等于增产一千五百多万双胶鞋。
    皮革行业中，除了提高皮子的利用率以外，计划在上海、天津、汉口、内蒙古等省市推广片皮经验，将原皮片成三层或两层，预计轻革的可片皮革约有一百四十万张，片出的皮子约等于增加七万张原皮，合一百二十多万平方市尺，能做皮箱八万只或做皮鞋三十五万双。仅按增加的皮子计算，就可以给国家创造六十万元的财富。
    日用陶瓷、火柴、自来水笔、铅笔、日用金属制品等行业，也都分别制定出了增产节约的具体方案。
