Xinhua News Agency, February 21st dispatch: TASS reports that after several days of talks, the Soviet and Bulgarian government delegations issued a joint declaration in Moscow on the 20th, stating that the Soviet Union and Bulgaria unanimously expressed their willingness to continue developing brotherly mutual assistance in all aspects in the future, and to cooperate fully with other socialist countries to further strengthen the unity and strength of the socialist camp and promote peace, democracy, and socialism.

The declaration stated that the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria is the solid foundation of the relations between the two countries, and no force can shake this eternal friendship between the brotherly peoples of the two countries.

In discussing the current international situation, the two government delegations pointed out in the declaration that the policy of the imperialist bloc aimed at intensifying the "Cold War" has recently caused a certain degree of tension in the international situation. The aggression of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel was an open challenge to universal peace and the security of all nations. However, this plan of imperialism in the Middle East was crushed. Both sides expressed support for the just demands of the Egyptian people to punish the aggressors, compensate Egypt for its losses, and withdraw foreign troops from Egyptian territory. The two governments reiterated their support for the Egyptian people's struggle to defend and consolidate their national independence. They announced that Egypt will continue to receive the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet and Bulgarian people in this regard.

The declaration continued, the situation in the Near and Middle East remains tense and harbors the danger of renewed complexities. The so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" recently proposed by American leaders proves that the United States intends to intensify its extensive economic expansion and direct military aggression policy in the Near and Middle East. The United States is attempting to suppress national independence movements and replace colonial powers such as Britain and France in this region, reimposing the shackles of colonial oppression on the people of various countries in this region. This practice poses a serious threat to peace and security in the Near and Middle East.

The joint declaration stated that the Soviet Union and Bulgaria fully support the aspirations of the people of the Near and Middle Eastern countries for national independence and are ready to expand comprehensive friendship and cooperation with these countries. The Bulgarian government fully supports the Soviet government's draft declaration to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France regarding peace and security in the Near and Middle East and non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries in this region.

The joint declaration stated that the Bulgarian government, on behalf of the Bulgarian people, reiterated its full support for the position taken by the Soviet Union in the Hungarian incident, believing that the Soviet Union's provision of armed assistance to the Hungarian people at the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government was the fulfillment of its internationalist obligations to the Hungarian people and the people of other socialist countries. Both sides expressed that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the Hungarian working people will always be able to obtain the support of the Soviet and Bulgarian people and their governments in their peaceful socialist labor.

The joint declaration continued that despite the failure of imperialism's adventures in Egypt and Hungary, the leading groups in the United States and certain other countries are still pursuing a policy of aggravating the international situation and inciting war hysteria.

The Soviet and Bulgarian governments firmly oppose the plan to station American special task force atomic weapon units on the territories of other countries and believe that not only the American government but also all governments that agree to allow their national territories to be used as offensive bases for preparing atomic warfare must be responsible for the consequences that may arise from the implementation of such plans.

The Soviet Union and Bulgaria believe that under the current circumstances, it is necessary to reiterate their commitment to the Warsaw Treaty and the obligations undertaken by the treaty participants to maintain peace and security. Both sides believe that eliminating European military blocs and replacing them with an all-European collective security system could eliminate the danger of military conflict and create solid conditions for lasting peace. Both sides will continue to make effective efforts to establish a European collective security system.

Both sides believe that they have a responsibility to make unremitting efforts to achieve the goal of universal and substantial reduction of armaments and armed forces, prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. To this end, the Bulgarian government delegation fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal of November 17, 1956, believing that this proposal provides a realistic possibility for breaking the deadlock on the disarmament issue and ultimately resolving it.

The two governments declared that they are determined to make every effort after the meeting to strive to establish normal and friendly relations with countries with different political and social systems, develop state, economic, and cultural ties, and strive to realize the great principles of peaceful coexistence and establish lasting world peace. The two governments expressed their firm belief that there is currently a real possibility of easing international tensions and normalizing the international situation.

Both sides hope that the relations between the countries of the Balkan Peninsula will be friendly and good-neighborly relations and should be based on the peaceful resolution of all disputes, the expansion of comprehensive ties, and mutual trust. The two governments expressed their willingness to promote the establishment and development of such relations with Greece and Turkey in the future while striving to further strengthen friendly relations with Yugoslavia.

The Soviet and Bulgarian governments expressed their support for the United Nations' admission of new member states. However, they believe that the United States' obstruction of the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations has brought serious damage to the prestige of the United Nations and the cause of peace. Now, no important international issue involving peace and the security of the people of all countries can be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. The two governments reiterated that they will steadfastly continue to make every effort to ensure that the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations can be restored immediately.

The joint declaration finally discussed the issue of developing economic, cultural, and friendly cooperation between the two countries. Both sides reiterated their determination to continue developing and consolidating relations between the two countries in these areas in the future on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and brotherly mutual assistance.

The Soviet government decided to provide the Bulgarian government with a new long-term loan totaling 200 million rubles for the development of some industrial sectors. At the request of the Bulgarian government, the Soviet government will also help Bulgaria design factories, provide the necessary equipment and specialized materials for these factories, and assist Bulgarian experts in learning at Soviet enterprises. In addition, it will help the Bulgarian government conduct research to determine the beneficiation methods for the newly discovered iron ore in Bulgaria.

Trade between the two countries will be further developed. Both sides instructed their respective relevant agencies to draft proposals on signing a long-term barter agreement between the two countries from 1958 to 1960 and to sign this agreement in June and July of this year.

Both sides also discussed the issue of further expanding cooperation between the two countries in agriculture and exchanged views on cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Both sides reached an agreement that Bulgaria will continue to supply uranium ore to the Soviet Union at fair and mutually beneficial prices in the future.

The joint declaration concluded by saying that the two governments believe that this meeting and talks of the two government delegations will promote the further strengthening and development of the existing unbreakable and eternal brotherly friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, promote the further development of close cooperation between the two countries, thereby benefiting the people of the two countries and promoting the great cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

The Soviet side represented by Bulganin, and the Bulgarian side represented by Yugov, signed this declaration on behalf of their respective governments.
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Communist Party delegation and the Bulgarian Communist Party delegation held talks on the 20th to discuss the most important issues in the international situation and the international workers' movement, as well as further strengthening cooperation and friendly ties between the two sides.

After the talks, the two party delegations issued a statement saying that the talks were conducted in a sincere and friendly atmosphere, full of mutual understanding and a spirit of agreement on all issues discussed.

The statement said that in the recent period, international reactionary forces have become rampant, attempting to consolidate their positions through the use of force and ideological interference, with the aim of weakening and dividing socialist countries and communist parties. The aggression of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel and the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary were integral parts of the imperialists' conspiracy against peace-loving people of all countries. Both of these imperialist adventures failed, proving the indestructible power of national liberation movements, democracy, and socialist forces.

After the failure of their open aggression against Egypt, the imperialists continue to use other methods, primarily the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine," to realize their attempts to subjugate the people of the Near and Middle East. In this region, they rely on aggressive alliances such as the Baghdad Pact to activate forces hostile to the people of the Balkan countries.

In the context of the imperialists' renewed attempts to aggravate international tensions and restore the "Cold War," the two communist parties believe that their most important task is to tirelessly fight to strengthen international trust, for peace, for peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems, for friendship and cooperation between the people of all countries, against the imperialist reactionaries and their aggressive plans, against all forms of colonialism and enslavement, for social progress, and for a better future for mankind.

The two communist parties believe that fighting to defend and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp is their most important and paramount task. The two parties emphasized that it is necessary to further expand the close ties and contacts between the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries through various forms that best meet the current conditions. Jointly discuss urgent issues of common interest in socialist construction, the theory and practice of the workers' movement. This mutual assistance and daily contact can create better conditions for avoiding mistakes in the theory and practice of socialist construction.

The two communist parties declared their unwavering fidelity to the principles of proletarian internationalism and their resolute opposition to any attempt to revise Marxism-Leninism, to any deviation that shakes and departs from Marxism-Leninism, and to attempts to disperse the ranks of the international revolutionary movement.

The two communist parties believe that the main laws of socialist construction are common to all countries. However, the forms and methods adopted by socialist construction in each country should take into account the economic, social, and national characteristics and traditions of each country.

The Bulgarian Communist Party's experience in leading the socialist transformation of agriculture and the achievements made by Bulgaria in this area are considered noteworthy and valuable. These achievements include: attracting the basic masses of farmers to participate in agricultural production cooperatives and transitioning them to the path of socialist development under the conditions of increasing the total output of agricultural products and increasing the income of agricultural production cooperative members.

The experience of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and many other socialist countries once again confirms the irrefutable superiority of the socialist method of managing agriculture and the practical possibility of the countryside transitioning to socialism under the conditions of continuously improving agricultural production levels and farmers' welfare levels.

The statement said that the traditional respect and friendly feelings between the people of the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, as well as between the two communist parties, are continuing to strengthen and develop. Both sides pointed out that the world-historically significant Leninist theory and practice, as well as the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have been of great help to the Bulgarian people and the Bulgarian Communist Party in achieving freedom and independence and building socialism, both in the past and now. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all working people highly value the contributions made by D. Blagoev and other Bulgarian revolutionaries in the development of the Russian workers' revolutionary movement, and the important role of G. Dimitrov, the long-tested leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party, in the international workers' movement.

The two party delegations announced that they are prepared to continue to strengthen and develop the existing friendly ties between the two parties in the future, to regularly exchange information on the most important issues in the international situation and domestic political life, to hold direct meetings and contacts between representatives of the two parties more frequently, and to constantly exchange experiences in party work with each other through the dispatch of party delegations, the exchange of party publications and documents, and other forms.

    发展各方面的兄弟互助　促进和平、民主和社会主义
    苏保两国政府发表联合宣言
    两党发表声明强调加强社会主义阵营的团结
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联和保加利亚两国政府代表团经过几天会谈后，20日在莫斯科发表联合宣言说，苏联和保加利亚双方一致表示愿意在今后继续发展各方面的兄弟互助，并且同其他社会主义国家通力合作，以进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结和力量，促进和平、民主和社会主义。
    宣言说，苏保两国人民兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊是两国关系的巩固基础，没有任何力量能够动摇两国兄弟人民之间的这种永恒友谊。
    在谈到目前的国际局势的时候，两国政府代表团在宣言中指出，帝国主义集团以加紧“冷战”为目的的政策在最近造成了国际局势的一定程度的紧张。英、法、以色列侵略埃及，是对普遍和平和各国人民安全的公开挑战。但是，帝国主义在中东地区的这一计划被粉碎了。双方表示支持埃及人民提出的、惩办侵略祸首、赔偿埃及遭受的损失和外国军队撤出埃及领土的公正要求。两国政府重申它们支持埃及人民保卫和巩固自己的民族独立的斗争。它们宣布，埃及今后在这方面继续会得到苏联和保加利亚人民的同情和援助。
    宣言接着说，目前，中近东地区的局势依然紧张，并且孕育着重新复杂起来的危险。美国领导人士最近提出的所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”证明，美国打算在中近东加紧实现广泛的经济扩张和直接军事侵略政策，美国企图压制民族独立运动和代替英法这样的殖民国家在这个地区的地位，把殖民主义压迫的枷锁重新套在这个地区各国人民的身上。这种做法给中近东地区的和平和安全造成严重威胁。
    联合宣言说，苏联和保加利亚完全支持中近东国家的人民要求民族独立的愿望，并且准备扩大同这些国家的全面友谊和合作。保加利亚政府完全支持苏联政府致交美、英、法三国政府的关于中近东的和平与安全以及不干涉这个地区国家内政的宣言草案。
    联合宣言说，保加利亚政府代表保加利亚人民重申完全支持苏联在匈牙利事件中所采取的立场，认为苏联根据匈牙利工农革命政府的请求给匈牙利人民以武装援助，是对匈牙利人民和其他社会主义国家人民尽到了国际主义义务。双方表示，匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利劳动人民在他们的和平的社会主义劳动中将永远能够得到苏联和保加利亚人民以及他们的政府的支持。
    联合宣言接着说，尽管帝国主义在埃及和匈牙利的冒险失败了，但是，目前美国以及某些其他国家的领导集团仍然在执行加剧国际局势、煽动战争狂热的政策。
    苏联政府和保加利亚政府坚决反对美国特种任务的原子武器部队驻扎在别国领土上的计划，并且认为，不仅美国政府、而且凡同意让自己国家的领土被用来作为准备原子战争的进攻基地的各国政府都要对实现这类计划可能引起的后果负责。
    苏联和保加利亚认为在现在的情势下有必要重申自己忠于华沙条约和条约参加国为了维护和平与安全所承担的义务。双方认为，消除欧洲军事集团、代之以全欧集体安全体系就可以消除军事冲突的危险、创造持久和平的牢靠条件。双方将继续为建立欧洲集体安全体系作有效的努力。
    双方认为自己有责任进行不懈的努力，以达到普遍的、大量的裁减军备和武装部队、禁止原子武器和氢武器以及停止原子武器和氢武器的试验的目的。为此，保加利亚政府代表团完全支持苏联1956年11月17日的建议，认为这项建议为打开裁军问题僵局和最后解决这个问题提供了现实的可能性。
    两国政府声明，它们坚决要在会后竭尽一切努力来争取同一切政治制度和社会制度不同的国家建立正常友好关系、发展国务、经济和文化联系，并且力求实现和平共处的伟大原则和建立世界持久和平。两国政府表示坚信，目前有着缓和国际紧张局势和使国际局势正常化的现实可能性。
    双方希望，巴尔干半岛各国之间的关系是友好的善邻关系，并且应该建立在和平解决一切争端问题、扩大全面联系和互相信任的基础上。两国政府表示愿意今后要促进同希腊和土耳其建立并且发展这种关系，同时力求进一步加强同南斯拉夫的友好关系。
    苏联和保加利亚政府对联合国接纳了新会员国表示拥护。但是它们认为美国阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利给联合国的威望和和平事业带来了严重损失。现在任何一个涉及到和平和各国人民安全的重要国际问题，没有中华人民共和国参加就不可能得到解决。两国政府重申要坚定不移地继续竭尽努力，以便使中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利能够立即恢复。
    联合宣言最后谈到了发展两国经济、文化友好合作的问题。双方重申，决心今后继续在平等、互利和兄弟互助的基础上发展和巩固两国之间在这些方面的关系。
    苏联政府决定向保加利亚政府再提供总数达二亿卢布的新的长期贷款，供它作为发展一些工业部门之用。苏联政府应保加利亚政府的请求还将帮助保加利亚设计工厂，提供这些工厂必需的装备、专门材料、协助保加利亚专家到苏联企业学习。此外还将帮助保加利亚政府进行研究工作，来确定新近在保加利亚发现的铁矿的选矿方法。
    两国之间的贸易将得到进一步的发展。双方责成本国的有关机构起草关于签订两国间从1958年到1960年的长期换货协定问题的建议，并且在今年6、7月间签订这个协定。
    双方还商讨了进一步扩大两国在农业方面的合作的问题，并且就在和平利用原子能方面进行合作交换了意见。双方达成协议，保加利亚今后继续按照公平、互利的价格向苏联供应铀矿砂。
    联合宣言最后说，两国政府相信：两国政府代表团这次举行的会见和会谈将会促进苏保两国人民之间现存的牢不可破的、永恒的兄弟友谊的进一步加强和发展，促进两国紧密合作的进一步发展，从而造福两国人民，促进伟大的和平、民主和社会主义事业。
    代表两国政府在这个宣言上签字的，苏联方面是布尔加宁，保加利亚方面是于哥夫。
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党代表团和保加利亚共产党代表团20日进行会谈，讨论了国际局势中和国际工人运动中的最重要的问题以及进一步加强双方合作和友好联系等问题。
    会谈后两党代表团发表声明说，这次会谈是在诚恳和友好的气氛中进行的，充满了彼此充分谅解、对讨论的全部问题观点一致的精神。
    声明说，近一个时期，国际反动势力猖獗起来了，他们企图通过武力和思想意识的干涉来巩固他们的阵地，他们抱着削弱和分裂社会主义国家和共产党的目的。英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及和匈牙利的反革命叛乱是帝国主义者对爱好和平的各国人民的阴谋的一个组成部分。帝国主义者这两次冒险行为都失败了，这证明民族解放运动、民主和社会主义力量不可摧毁的威力。
    帝国主义者在公开地侵略埃及失败以后，继续用其他方法、首先是用所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”来实现他们使中近东人民屈从于他们的企图。他们在这个地区依靠巴格达条约这样的侵略联盟，来活跃同巴尔干各国人民敌对的势力。
    在帝国主义者重新企图加剧国际紧张关系和恢复“冷战”的情况下，两国共产党认为，他们的最重要任务是为加强国际信任、为和平、为同不同的社会制度的国家和平共处，为各国人民之间的友谊和合作，为反对帝国主义反动派和他们的侵略计划，为反对一切形式的殖民主义和奴役，为社会进步和人类美好的未来而不倦地斗争。
    两国共产党认为为保卫和加强社会主义阵营的团结而斗争是自己的最重要的和头等的任务。两党强调指出，必须通过最符合当前条件的各种形式进一步扩大社会主义各国的共产党和工人党之间的紧密联系和接触。共同讨论社会主义建设、工人运动的理论和实践中的具有共同利害的迫切问题。这种互助和日常联系可以为在社会主义建设的理论和实践中避免犯错误创设更好的条件。
    两国共产党声明坚定不移地忠实于无产阶级国际主义原则和坚决反对要想修正马克思列宁主义的任何企图，反对动摇和脱离马克思列宁主义的任何偏向，反对涣散国际革命运动队伍的思想的尝试。
    两国共产党认为，社会主义建设的主要规律是各国共同的规律。然而，各国社会主义建设采取什么形式和方法就要考虑每一个国家的经济、社会和民族的特点和传统。
    保加利亚共产党在领导农业社会主义改造方面的经验和保加利亚在这方面所取得的成就被认为是值得注意的和有价值的，这方面的成就是：吸引农民基本群众参加农业生产合作社以及在农产品总产量增加和农业生产合作社社员收入增加的条件下把它们过渡到社会主义发展的道路上。
    苏联、保加利亚以及其他许多社会主义国家的经验再次证实社会主义管理农业的方法的无可辩驳的优越性以及农村在不断提高农业生产水平和农民福利水平的条件下过渡到社会主义的实际可能性。
    声明说，苏保两国人民以及两国共产党之间传统的敬爱和友好的感情在继续加强和发展。双方指出，具有世界历史意义的列宁主义理论和实践以及苏联共产党的经验，在保加利亚取得自由独立和建设社会主义方面，过去和现在都对保加利亚人民和保加利亚共产党有很大帮助。苏联共产党人和全体劳动人民对季·布拉戈耶夫和保加利亚其他革命家在发展俄国工人革命运动中所作的贡献，对保加利亚共产党人的久经考验的领导者格·季米特洛夫在国际工人运动中的重要作用，给予很高的评价。
    两党代表团宣布，他们准备在今后继续加强和发展两党之间现存的友好联系，经常就国际局势和国内政治生活中最重要的问题交换情报，更经常地举行两党代表之间的直接会见和接触，通过派遣党代表团、交换党出版物和文件的方法以及其它的形式彼此经常交流党的工作经验。
