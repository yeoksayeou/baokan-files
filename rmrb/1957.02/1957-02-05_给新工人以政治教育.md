    Political Education for New Workers
    The working class is the leading class in our country. It is able to occupy the leading position precisely because it has a high degree of political consciousness, strong organization, discipline, and an indomitable fighting spirit. Because of this, it can unite the broad masses, overcome all difficulties, and strive to realize the highest ideal of mankind – communism. The victorious completion of our country's democratic revolution and the great achievements made in socialist construction over the past few years prove that our country's working class has a high degree of awareness, and its organization, discipline, and fighting spirit are very strong. At present, the working class in our country is shouldering a great and arduous historical task, which is to build our country into a socialist industrialized nation. This great task requires the working class to strengthen its organization and discipline, and heroically stand at the forefront of the struggle to lead the people forward.
    However, this does not mean that there are no defects in our working class ranks. No. Because our working class ranks are rapidly developing and expanding, and a large number of new workers are increasing, it is necessary to constantly pay attention to strengthening their education in order to maintain the ideological and political consolidation of the working class ranks. According to statistics, the total number of employees nationwide in 1949 was 7,257,000, which increased to 17,515,000 in 1953; by the end of September 1956, the total number of employees nationwide had reached 24,730,000, an increase of more than two times compared with 1949. These many new workers often easily become infected with or bring with them non-working-class ideologies. We should strengthen their education, promote their enthusiasm, and overcome the non-working-class ideologies they have contracted, allowing them to healthily grow into a new force on our country's production front.
    At present, the vast majority of new workers are young people around the age of twenty. They participate in the construction of the motherland with full enthusiasm. They have the desire to improve politically and technically. After coming to factories and mines, many new workers, under the leadership of Party organizations and with the help of veteran workers, humbly study, correct their attitude towards labor, and love their work. There was a new worker in the Kunming Smelting Plant who was not content with the work of pushing a small cart. An old worker said to him, "Pushing a small cart is much better now than it used to be. When I first entered the factory before liberation, the things in this cart had to be carried by people. At that time, if you didn't work, you wouldn't have food to eat." The new worker was greatly inspired by these words and expressed his determination to do his job diligently. Many new workers have quickly mastered technology and started to take on work independently through diligent study and mutual encouragement, and some have become advanced producers. Among the 724 apprentices in the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, 116 were rated as excellent apprentices. In addition, there are also some people who have been deeply influenced by the old society. After joining the working class ranks, they expressed their determination to study, transform themselves, and work hard to serve the cause of socialist construction. We should try our best to meet the new workers' demands for political and technical progress and help them transform and train themselves.
    However, some leading organs and enterprise units' leaders lack sufficient assessment of the new situations and new problems in the current working class ranks. They have overly and hastily emphasized cultural education and technical education, neglecting political and ideological education. In some units, the arrangement of employees' spare time, in addition to a small amount of Party, League, and trade union activities, almost all the time is occupied by cultural, technical, and other courses. Some units have carried out some political education, but they have not done so according to the different situations of the new workers. Some units simply canceled political study. As a result, some workers are not interested in studying, pick and choose their work, and always complain about their wages being too low and demand more. Some raise inappropriate and excessively high demands in terms of welfare. For example, a new worker in a power plant in Beijing was assigned by the leadership to work in the boiler room, but he complained that it was too hot and dirty; when he was assigned to work in the turbine workshop, he complained that the workshop was too noisy. Because of the weakness of political and ideological work, a phenomenon of simply pursuing material enjoyment has occurred among some new workers. Due to the neglect of political and ideological education, the phenomenon of new workers not abiding by labor discipline and arbitrarily being absent from work has also increased in some factories and mines. All of this proves that if political and ideological work is neglected, various non-working-class ideologies will spread. To prevent this phenomenon, the primary task is to provide new workers with political education.
    It is of great significance to systematically carry out communist education, especially for new workers. It is particularly important to educate new workers to understand what proletarian ideology is and what non-proletarian ideology is, so that they clearly recognize the responsibilities of the working class, understand the relationship between individual interests and overall interests, consciously place collective interests above individual interests, and diligently and simply contribute their strength to building socialism.
    The educational methods should be diverse. In regular activities, the method of combining positive education with criticism and self-criticism should be adopted. Praise good people and good deeds, criticize bad people and bad deeds. We can hold forums for new and old workers, and adopt the method of recalling and comparing to arouse everyone's hatred for the old society and love for the new society, and improve vigilance against the enemy, so as to serve the socialist construction of the motherland wholeheartedly. We can also adopt the method of detailed accounting, specifically calculating the development of production and the improvement of life in recent years, so that everyone loves their work more, increases production and practices economy, builds the country diligently and thriftily, and lays a material foundation for further improving the living standards of the broad masses of people. When conditions permit, short-term training classes can also be opened to provide new workers with short-term political training. In short, we must always pay attention to using all possible ways and opportunities to ensure that new workers can receive correct political and ideological education anytime and anywhere.
    As for the few bad elements who have infiltrated the ranks of workers, who engage in hooliganism, theft, obscenity, and illegal activities, they should also be given the necessary treatment.
    When launching the mass movement to increase production and practice economy, factories and mining enterprises in various places should pay special attention to the political education of new workers. Only by strengthening the political and ideological education of employees can we give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of employees and carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy extensively and deeply.

### 给新工人以政治教育

    给新工人以政治教育
    工人阶级是我们国家的领导阶级。它所以能够居于领导地位，就是因为它具有高度的政治觉悟，有坚强的组织性、纪律性，有不屈不挠的战斗精神。正因为这样，它能团结广大群众，战胜一切困难，为实现人类的最高理想——共产主义而奋斗。我国民主革命的胜利完成和几年来社会主义建设事业所取得的巨大成就，证明了我国的工人阶级是有很高的觉悟的，它的组织性、纪律性和战斗性都是很强的。目前，我国工人阶级正担负着一个伟大而艰巨的历史任务，要把我们的国家建设成为社会主义工业化的国家。这个伟大的任务要求工人阶级增强自己的组织性、纪律性，英勇地站在斗争的最前列领导人民前进。
    但是，这并不等于说我国工人阶级队伍已经没有缺陷了。不是的。由于我国工人阶级的队伍正在迅速地发展壮大，新工人大量地增加，这就需要不断地注意加强对他们的教育，以保持工人阶级队伍在思想上和政治上的巩固。据统计，1949年全国职工总数为七百二十五万七千人，1953年增长到一千七百五十一万五千人；1956年9月底，全国职工总数已经达到两千四百七十三万人，比1949年增加了两倍多。这许多新工人往往容易沾染上或带来了非工人阶级的思想意识，我们应当针对他们的特点，加强对他们的教育，发扬他们的积极性，克服他们所沾染的非工人阶级的思想意识，让他们健康地成长为我国生产战线上的新生力量。
    现时绝大多数的新工人都是二十岁左右的年轻人。他们怀着满腔热情，参加祖国的建设。他们在政治上技术上都有进步的要求。有很多新工人来到厂矿以后，在党组织的领导和老工人的帮助下，虚心学习，端正了劳动态度，热爱本岗位的工作。昆明冶炼厂有个新工人不安心于推小车的工作，老工人向他说：“现在推小车比过去好多了。我在解放以前刚进厂的时候，这小车推的东西还是要人挑的。那时不干就没饭吃。”新工人听了这番话，受到很大的启发，表示要勤勤恳恳做好工作。有很多新工人由于刻苦钻研、相互勉励，很快地掌握了技术，开始独立地担当工作，有的已经成为先进生产者。上海机床厂七百二十四名艺徒中有一百十六人被评为优秀艺徒。另外，也有一些受了旧社会影响较深的人，他们投入工人阶级队伍以后，表示决心学习，改造自己，努力为社会主义建设事业服务。我们应该尽量满足新工人在政治上、技术上的进步要求，帮助他们进行改造和锻炼。
    但是，有些领导机关和企业单位的领导人员，对于当前工人阶级队伍的新情况和新问题缺乏足够的估计。他们过多过急地强调了文化教育和技术教育，忽视了政治思想教育。有些单位对职工业余时间的安排，除了少量的党、团、工会活动以外，几乎全部时间被文化、技术等课程占去了。有的单位虽然进行了一些政治教育，却没有根据新工人的不同情况来进行。有的单位干脆把政治学习取消了。因此，有些工人对学习不感兴趣，对工作挑挑拣拣，对工资总是嫌少争多，有的在生活福利方面提出不适当的过高的要求。例如，北京某电厂有个新工人，领导上分配他到锅炉房工作，他嫌太热太脏；分配他到汽机车间工作，他又嫌这个车间太响。因为政治思想工作薄弱，一种单纯追求物质享受的现象在部分新工人中发生了。由于忽视政治思想教育，新工人中不遵守劳动纪律，任意缺勤旷工的现象在某些厂矿企业里也加多了。这些都证明，如果忽视政治思想工作，各种非工人阶级的思想意识就会蔓延起来。而要防止这种现象，首要的任务就是要给新工人以政治教育。
    针对一般新工人的特点，系统地进行共产主义教育是有重大意义的。特别要教育新工人懂得什么是无产阶级思想，什么是非无产阶级思想，使他们明确认识工人阶级的责任，懂得个人利益和整体利益的关系，自觉地把集体利益放在个人利益之上，勤勤恳恳，艰苦朴素地为建设社会主义贡献出自己的力量。
    教育的方法应该是多种多样的。在经常的活动中应该采用正面教育跟批评和自我批评相结合的方法。表扬好人好事，批判坏人坏事。可以举行新老工人座谈会，采取回忆对比的方法，以唤起大家对旧社会的仇恨和对新社会的热爱，提高对敌人的警惕性，从而全心全意地为祖国的社会主义建设服务。也可以采取算细账的办法，具体计算几年来生产发展和生活改善的情况，使大家更加热爱工作，增产节约，勤俭建国，为进一步提高广大人民的生活水平打下物质基础。在条件许可的时候，也可以开办短期训练班，对新工人进行短期的政治训练。总之，要时刻注意利用一切可能的方式和机会，使新工人们能够随时随地受到正确的政治思想教育。
    至于少数混入工人队伍中的坏分子，有流氓、盗窃、伤风败俗和违法行为的，还应当给以必要的处理。
    各地厂矿企业在发动群众开展增产节约运动的时候，应该特别抓住对新工人的政治教育。只有加强了对职工的政治思想教育，才能充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，广泛深入地开展增产节约运动。
