    "Production Indicator Chart"
    Cao Baoming
    I knew very well that the rolling mill workshop only had one overall production indicator chart in the office, but Xiao Chen insisted that they had one in their class as well. This confused me. At that moment, their class leader, Lao Zhao, walked over and said to him, "Stop it, go see if the accounting team has calculated yesterday's costs yet." Xiao Chen said, "Is there any need to ask? I've already seen it very clearly: the output is exceeded, the cost is also okay, um, it's just that the coal consumption is a bit high, zero point one two higher..." This immediately made everyone around laugh.
    It turned out that they called Lao Zhao's face the "production indicator chart"!
    Lao Zhao's nickname has a story. He got married last year. This young rural woman was really unaccustomed to living with him in the factory. Sometimes, when he came back from work, he would shout as soon as he entered the door, "Quick, bring me food, I'm hungry!" He urged her to rush around, and she rolled her eyes at him, but he didn't notice, and helped her happily with this and that, making her not know whether to be angry or laugh. Sometimes, she prepared good dishes and good food for him early, but he would come home and sit silently without saying a word, unable to eat. He just frowned, his face gloomy, not sick, not angry, and when asked what was wrong, he wouldn't say anything, scaring her and making her not know what to do. Later, some family members who had lived in the factory for a long time told her, "This must be related to the factory's production plan. Ours is the same." She finally understood. Once, a few young workers from the class went to their house to play, and this lively young woman boasted to them, "Hmph, I don't even have to go out to know whether your production is good every day!" Everyone asked her how she knew, and she said, "Well, there is a saying circulating among our family members, called 'Look at the weather when you go out, and look at the face when you come in'. When he comes back from work, I look at his face and see whether you have completed the plan today." "Doesn't our class leader's face become a 'production indicator chart'?" From then on, Lao Zhao's nickname was spread by the young worker Xiao Chen.
    In fact, if this nickname was given just because of being happy when production is good and worried when production is bad, then all the young men in Lao Zhao's youth work team could be called "production indicator charts". When another team creates a new record, they secretly encourage themselves to catch up. They take turns resting every fifteen minutes, and the worker standing at the end writes down how many bars have been rolled on the small blackboard, adding as they go. When it's almost time to get off work, everyone knows how much work has been done that day and how much of the plan has been completed, and they try their best to catch up. Which team produces the most is the most glorious! If they haven't caught up for three consecutive days, they don't say a word when handing over, and then hurriedly take a bath, pick up their lunch boxes, and walk home with their heads down. If their own team has created several new records in a row, their enthusiasm is indescribable. When handing over, they immediately want to introduce some experience to others, and immediately want to remind others to pay attention to what problems, making the people taking over feel very annoyed. Everyone rushes into the bathhouse in a swarm, singing loudly, laughing, jumping around, stirring up the entire pool of water, annoying some older workers who keep complaining, and the old man who manages the bathhouse also comes to interfere, but they don't care.
    A few days ago, this youth work team created several new records, but fell into a very embarrassing situation. This could be seen very clearly from Lao Zhao's face: the eyelids under the two thick and black "broadsword eyebrows" were drooping all day long, and a pair of bloodshot eyes stared fixedly ahead, yet it was as if they saw nothing.
    The problem lies in the fact that these young men only like to catch up with output. In this increase production and practice economy campaign, the workshop promoted the "team economic accounting system", which not only counted how many steel bars each team produced, but also how much steel billet, coal, and labor each team used, and the next day it was converted into the cost of each team and announced, so everyone could see whether their team had completed the cost plan, how much they had "earned" or "lost". Lao Zhao's youth work team was now stumped. Because they loved to catch up with output, they sometimes burned the fire too fiercely, burning the surface of the steel billet until it was flowing with molten steel, resulting in high coal consumption and steel billet loss; sometimes they couldn't wait for the steel billet to be burned through, so they rushed to roll "black" steel, which was rolled out of specification and calculated at the secondary price. As a result, although they created several new records, producing dozens more steel bars than other teams, the cost was higher than other teams, and sometimes they didn't even complete the cost plan, "losing" money.
    Once, Xiao Chen became anxious. He saw that the quality inspector was not around, so he secretly moved the steel bars that had been picked out as "secondary products" to the pile of good steel bars. Unexpectedly, Lao Zhao shouted from behind, "Xiao Chen, what are you doing?" Xiao Chen wanted to deny it, but when he turned around and saw Lao Zhao looking like he was going to fight, he was immediately so frightened that he kept saying, "I, I, I..." "What are you going to do? Hurry up and move it back!" Everyone in the class saw this.
    But two weeks later, Xiao Chen happily said to me again, "We are going to be different today. We sent the people on the reheating furnace to the second shift to learn the experience of firing. We also learned the method of the third shift, if the steel billet is not burned through, the people standing at the front will block it and not roll it, and send it back to the furnace to be reheated. In addition, our Lao Zhao also found a very clever eye, cough, I won't say it." "What, are you keeping it a secret?" "No, if I say it, Lao Zhao will say that I'm talking nonsense before the experiment is even successful." But, in less than three minutes, Xiao Chen, who couldn't hold back his words, still said this "clever eye". It turned out that when Xiao Chen and his gang went home dejectedly, Lao Zhao stayed in the workshop with the intern technician, and according to the chief engineer's saying that "the biggest saving in a steel plant is to make full use of thermal energy", he figured out the suggestion of "hot charging steel billets", making the plans of the large and small rolling mills consistent, so that the red steel billets would be sent to the reheating furnace without letting them cool down, to be rolled into steel bars by the small rolling mill. This is better and faster than reheating cold steel billets, and also saves coal. After making preparations, the workshop decided to experiment in their class.
    On this day, the steel bar yard outside was covered with a layer of white snow, but Xiao Chen and the others had already taken off their cotton clothes and put on coarse canvas work clothes, waiting to go to work. As soon as the bell rang, they went forward to work with the people from the previous shift to sweep the site, clean the furnace, and adjust the machines. At this time, the workshop dispatcher personally directed the scene, and the workshop director and branch secretary also stood by and watched. The red steel billets were just opened, still sparkling, and immediately hoisted by the crane to the back of the small reheating furnace to be loaded into the furnace. Then, the furnace workers scooped out the bright steel billets, which were a bit dazzling, and slid them vigorously to the feet of the front-line workers, and they were quickly fed into the rolling groove. The red steel billet just showed its head from the previous rolling groove, and was immediately clamped with iron tongs and sent to the next rolling groove. The steel bars, which became thinner and longer as they were rolled, were made like many jumping fire snakes,窜来窜去(darting back and forth) in front of and behind the rolling mill that splashed with cold water. Xiao Chen, who usually made a fool of himself on any occasion, was also working very hard and seriously at this time.
    The next day, as soon as work started, many people were crowded in front of the workshop office looking at the red happy report. This class rolled the most steel bars, and had the least steel billet loss and coal consumption! Lao Zhao was introducing experience to the class leaders of other classes. Xiao Chen was shouting something loudly to people in the workers' lounge. When I went, Xiao Chen mysteriously whispered in my ear again:
    "Go and see our production indicator chart, he must be smiling, his face radiant..."

    “生产指示图表”
    曹葆铭
    我很清楚，轧钢车间就只办公室里有一份总的生产指示图表，但小陈楞说他们班里也有一份。这倒给我闹迷糊了。这时，他们班长老赵走过来向他说道：“别扯了，快去看看核算组把昨天的成本算出来没有”。小陈说道：“这还用问吗？我已经看得很清楚：产量超额了，成本也还好，唔，就是煤耗高了点儿，高个零点一二……”顿时闹得旁边的人都笑了。
    原来，他们竟将老赵的脸孔叫做“生产指示图表”！
    老赵这个外号儿有个来由。他去年结的婚。这个农村青年妇女初到工厂来跟他生活在一起，真不习惯。有时候，他下班回来，一进门就喊道：“快端饭来，我肚子饿了！”催得她手忙脚乱，直向他白眼儿，他也不觉得，还眼笑眉开地帮助她弄这端那的，逗得她气不是，笑也不是。有时候，她早早地为他备办了好菜、好饭，他回家来却一声不响地闷坐着，饭也吃不下。只见他紧锁眉头，满脸阴沉沉的，说病不是病，说气不是气，问他出了啥事儿，他也不讲，吓得她心慌意乱，不知咋办才好。后来，一些在工厂住得久的家属告诉她：“这准是跟厂里的生产计划有关系。我们那个也一样。”她才算摸了底。有一次，班里几个青工上他们家去玩，这个性情活泼的青年妇女就向他们吹道：“哼，我一天不出门，也晓得你们每天的生产好不好！”大家追问她是怎么知道的，她说：“我呀，我们家属里流传的有句话，叫做‘出门看天色，进门看脸色’，他下班回来，我一瞧他的脸，就看出了你们今天完成计划好不好。”“我们班长的脸不成了‘生产指示图表’？”从此，老赵这个外号就由青工小陈给传开了。
    其实，如果是因为生产好高兴，生产坏愁闷，就给取上这个外号的话，老赵这个青工班的小伙子们都可以叫做“生产指示图表”。别班一创造了新纪录，他们就暗地里鼓着劲往前赶。他们每十五分钟轮流休息一次，站在尾档的工人就用粉笔往小黑板上记下轧了多少条，边记边加，一到快下班的时候，大伙心里都清楚这天干了多少活，完成计划多少，拼命想法往前赶。哪班生产的最多最光荣！要是连续三天没赶上去，大伙交班时一句多余的话也不说，接着匆匆忙忙地将澡一洗，就提着饭盒，低着头往家走。要是自己班上连续创造了几个新纪录，大伙那股劲儿就不能提了。交班时，一下子要向人家介绍什么经验，一下子又要提醒人家注意什么问题，闹得接班的人心里烦得不行。大家一窝蜂拥进澡堂去，大唱大笑，乱蹦乱跳，将一池水都搅浑了，闹得一些老年工人直唠叨，管理澡堂的老头也跑来干涉，他们也不在乎。
    前些天，这个青工班又创造了几个新纪录，但却陷入了很窘的处境。这从老赵的脸上看的很清楚：两道又黑又浓的“大刀眉”下的眼皮成天往下搭着，一对充满了血丝的眼睛死固固地向前盯着什么，却又像什么也没看见。
    问题就出在这群小伙子光喜欢赶产量上。在这次增产节约中，车间推行“班组经济核算制”，不仅统计每班出了多少钢条，还统计每班用了多少钢坯、多少煤和多少人工，第二天就折算成每班的成本公布出来，大家一看就知道自己班上完成成本计划没有，“赚”了多少或“赔”了多少。老赵领导的青工班这下就给难住了。因为他们爱赶产量，有时将火烧得太猛，烧得钢坯表面直淌钢水，弄得煤耗和钢坯损耗都很高；有时又等不及将钢坯烧透，就抢着轧“黑”钢，轧得不合规格，按次品次价计算。这样一来，他们虽然创造了几个新纪录，比别班多出了几十根钢条，但成本比别班高，有时还没有完成成本计划，“赔”了账。
    有一次，小陈急了，他瞅着质量检查员不在，便偷偷地将被拣在一边列为“次品”的钢条往好钢条堆里搬，冷不防老赵在背后吆喝了一声：“小陈，你干啥？”小陈本想抵赖几句，但回头一看，老赵像要跟人打架似的，顿时吓得他只是连连不断地说：“我，我，我……”“你要干啥？还不赶快搬回来！”这件事全班的人都看见了。
    可是过了两个星期，小陈又高高兴兴地对我说：“我们今天就要不同了。我们派了再热炉上的人去第二班学习烧火的经验。我们又学习了第三班的办法，如果钢坯没烧透，站在头档的人就挡住不轧，回炉重烧。另外，我们老赵还找了个巧极眼，咳，我不说了。”“怎么，还兴保守啦？”“不是，我要是说了，老赵又会说我试验都还没成功就瞎嚷嚷。”但是，没过三分钟，肚里憋不住话的小陈还是将这个“巧极眼”说出来了。原来，当小陈这帮小伙子垂头丧气地回家去的时候，老赵却同实习技术员留在车间，根据总工程师讲的“钢铁厂最大的节约是充分利用热能”这句话，琢磨出了“热装钢坯”的建议，将大小两台轧钢机的计划安排一致，红钢坯一开出来，不让它冷却，就往再热炉里送，给小轧钢机轧成钢条。这样就比过去重烧冷钢坯要好、要快，还省煤。在作好准备以后，车间决定在他们班上试验。
    这天，外面的钢筋场上盖着一层白雪，小陈他们却早就脱下棉衣，穿上粗帆布工作服，等上班。钟声一响，他们就上前去同上一班的人一起打扫场地，清炉子，调整机器。这时，车间调度长亲自在现场指挥，车间主任和支部书记也站在旁边观看。通红的钢坯刚开出来，还冒着火花，马上就由天车吊到小再热炉后去装炉。接着，炉前工人就捞出了亮得有些刺眼的钢坯，使劲滑到头档工人脚下，很快就喂到轧槽里去了。红钢坯刚由上一个轧槽露出个头来，立即又被铁钳夹住往下一个轧槽里送，这越轧越细、越轧越长的钢条就被弄得像许多条暴跳的火蛇，在溅着冷水的轧钢机前后窜来窜去。平日不管在什么场合都要出些洋相的小陈，这时也干得挺猛，挺认真。
    第二天刚上班，车间办公室门前就挤着许多人在看红色的大喜报。他们这个班轧得钢条最多，钢坯损耗和用煤最少！老赵在向别班的班长介绍经验。小陈在工人休息室里大声向人嚷着什么。我一去，小陈又故作神秘地附在我耳边说：
    “你去看看我们的生产指示图表，他准是眼笑眉开，满面红光……。”
