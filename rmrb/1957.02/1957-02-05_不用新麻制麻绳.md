    Making Hemp Rope Without Using New Hemp
      (Our report) Jinan - In order to save raw hemp and support national economic construction, all members of the Chengguan Hemp Rope Production Cooperative in Liaocheng County, Shandong Province, have demonstrated a high degree of socialist initiative and decided to use old, broken hemp rope and substitutes to manufacture hemp rope. For ten months, they have been actively publicizing in rural areas, mobilizing the masses to peel cotton stalks, and going to factories, mines, and government offices in other places to purchase old, broken hemp rope. In just three months, they purchased 39,500 jin of cotton stalks, and in ten months, they purchased 123,600 jin of old, broken hemp rope from factories and supply and marketing cooperatives in Anyang, Handan, and other places. They also signed long-term contracts with these factories, mines, and government offices to purchase old, broken hemp rope, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. In total, they produced 156,500 jin of various ropes and hemp fiber in ten months, meeting the needs of the masses and maintaining normal production. The income of cooperative members has increased by 42.5% compared to before, and the public accumulation within the cooperative has reached more than 14,000 yuan. (Qu Zhongting)
