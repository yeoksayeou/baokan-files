Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang. In the second half of 1956, due to the increase in basic construction tasks in Nanchang City, construction units had plans to recruit a number of rural laborers; at the same time, some farmers blindly flowed into the city. These farmers actively participated in basic construction, enabling many projects to overfulfill their plans.

Since the beginning of 1957, most projects have been basically completed, and new projects have not yet started. Currently, rural areas are facing the spring plowing season. In order to reduce the idleness of urban construction workers and support spring plowing production, the Municipal Labor Bureau and various basic construction units have formed work groups to mobilize these farmers to return to their hometowns to participate in production. Many farmers said, "If industrial construction needs us, we will come; if agricultural production needs us, we will return to the countryside!" Some construction sites, in order to commend these farmers for their contributions to construction, specially presented them with banners.

    南昌市动员参加基本建设的农民回乡春耕
    据新华社南昌电　1956年下半年，南昌市由于基本建设任务增加，各施工单位都有计划地招雇了一批农村劳动力；与此同时，也有一部分农民盲目流入城市。这批农民积极参加基本建设，使许多工程超额完成了计划。
    1957年开始以来，大部分工程已经基本结束，新的工程还没开工；目前农村又面临春耕生产季节，为了减少城市建筑工人窝工，支援春耕生产，市劳动局和各基本建设施工单位就抽调干部组成工作组，动员这批农民返乡参加生产。许多农民表示：“工业建设需要我们，我们就来，农业生产需要，我们就回到农村去！”有的工地为了表扬这批农民对建设的贡献，还特地赠给了他们锦旗。
