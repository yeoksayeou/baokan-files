(Reported by this newspaper from Shenyang on the 11th) The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently discussed the issues of improving the commercial system and increasing commercial networks. The Municipal Committee believes that in order to better leverage the role of various commercial organizations, expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, strengthen socialist transformation, and facilitate service to production and consumption, it is necessary to improve the existing commercial leadership system and appropriately delegate some of the leadership powers that were previously over-concentrated in the city to districts and grassroots stores.

After the delegation of powers, the division of labor between the city and districts will be as follows: the city will mainly be responsible for the unified arrangement of the market, the organization of goods supply, and the operation of wholesale businesses. Retail stores that are closely related to people's daily lives will be under the dual leadership of the districts. The authority of grassroots stores will be appropriately expanded, and they will be given a certain amount of working capital to make them independent accounting units, so as to leverage the enthusiasm and flexibility of grassroots stores. It is preliminarily determined that the first step will be to transfer retail stores for food groceries, vegetables, sundries, coal, and firewood to the districts. The Municipal Committee also decided to streamline the staff of municipal commercial agencies by about 30%. All municipal specialized companies that are suitable for merger should be merged. For example, the food grocery company, vegetable company, candy and pastry company, and monopoly company should all be merged. The existing six general stores for general merchandise, meat, tea, etc., should also be gradually abolished. The personnel streamlined will mainly be used to strengthen grassroots stores and add commercial networks. The change in the commercial leadership system will be tested in several districts first.

Due to the inappropriate reduction of many commercial supply points in the past few years, especially the large-scale merger of stores during economic restructuring, which has caused inconvenience to residents' consumption and overcrowding in stores, it is necessary to reorganize and add commercial networks. The preliminary plan is to set up fifty large specialized stores with more than 50 employees and a number of medium-sized stores with more than 30 employees. In addition, it is also planned to rebuild the collapsed North Market. A number of small and medium-sized retail stores will also be established in the new industrial and residential areas. The establishment of large retail stores will still be the responsibility of the city, while the establishment of small and medium-sized stores will be the responsibility of the districts. The problem of housing for newly established stores will mainly rely on moving a part of the commercial housing that has been occupied by agencies and enterprises and tapping the potential of existing store housing, which will be jointly investigated and studied by the Municipal Real Estate Bureau and commercial departments.

The meeting also discussed the problem that the excessively large mergers and consolidations of joint public-private industrial and handicraft industries during economic restructuring have led to a reduction in small and scattered products and repair service industries that meet the needs of people's lives, and proposed corresponding improvement measures.

    沈阳决定改进商业体制
    将某些领导权限下放到区和基层商店
    精简市级机构重新安排和增设商业网
    本报沈阳11日电　中共沈阳市委日前讨论了改进商业体制和增设商业网的问题。市委认为为了更好地发挥各类商业组织机构的作用，扩大城乡物资交流，加强社会主义改造工作，有利于为生产和消费服务，有必要改进现有的商业领导体制，将原有过于集中在市的某些领导权限适当下放到区和基层商店。
    权限下放后，市和区的分工是：市主要负责统一安排市场、组织货源和经营批发业务，凡属与人民日常生活有密切关系的零售商店，则交给各区双重领导；并适当扩大基层商店的权限，给予一定的流动资金，使它成为独立的核算单位，以发挥基层店的积极性和灵活性。初步确定：第一步将食品杂货、蔬菜、下杂货、煤炭、劈柴等零售店交到各区。市委还决定精简市级商业机构人员30％左右。凡是适宜合并的市专业公司均应合并，如食品杂货公司、蔬菜公司、糖果糕点公司和专卖公司等，均以合并为好。现有的百货、食肉、茶叶等六个总店也应逐步撤销。精简下来的人员主要将加强基层商店和增设商业网。商业领导体制的改变，准备先在几个区试行。
    由于过去几年中不适当地减少了许多商业供应点，特别在经济改组中商店的大量合并，造成了目前居民消费不便和商店拥挤现象，需要重新安排和增设商业网。初步计划设置五十个营业员以上的大型专业商店和三十个营业员以上的中型商店若干个。此外还准备重建已倒塌的北市商场。在新的工业区和住宅区也将争取建立一批中小型零售商店。大型零售商店的设置仍由市负责，中小型商店则由各区负责设置。新设置商店用房问题，主要依靠动迁一部分已被机关企业占用的商业用房和挖掘现有商店的用房潜力，由市房产局和商业部门共同调查研究解决。
    会议还讨论了公私合营工业和手工业在经济改组中不适当地大合大并，致使适应人民生活需要的零星细小产品和修理服务行业减少的问题，提出了相应的改进措施。
