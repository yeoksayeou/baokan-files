    The Ignorance of New Fetishists
    According to historical records, fetishism originated in the ancient human's ignorant belief that various natural objects possessed unlimited power. With the increase of human practical knowledge, many fetishisms have naturally disappeared. But today, in the 1950s, there is a new kind of fetishism, whose followers worship murderous weapons and take bombs as their totems. Even painful lessons cannot break their superstition. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd is such a devout believer.
    On February 11, in the British Parliament, some members condemned the Conservative government's indiscriminate bombing in the Yemen region. Foreign Secretary Lloyd actually shouted ferociously: Conducting bombing is "the only feasible way to maintain law and order" in the Yemen region.
    It seems that the British colonialists have not learned a single lesson from the failure of the invasion of Egypt. Everyone knows that Britain and its allies dropped quite a few bombs on Port Said, but they failed to impose their jungle law and restore their colonial order in Egypt. So, how can these British gentlemen, who are still wincing from the beating they just received, now think that they can use another batch of bombs to make the people of another place bow to them?
    These new fetishists are a hundred times more ignorant than their primitive counterparts. (Rui)

### 新拜物教徒的愚昧

    新拜物教徒的愚昧
    根据历史记载，拜物教起源于古代人类迷信各种自然物具有无限威力的曚昧观念。随着人类实际知识的增进，许多拜物教都已经自然而然地消灭了。但是在二十世纪五十年代的今天，却有着一种新兴的拜物教，它的信徒们崇拜杀人的武器，把炸弹作为他们的图腾。甚至惨痛的教训也不能破除他们的迷信。英国外交大臣劳埃德就是这样一名虔诚的教徒。
    2月11日在英国议会中，有些议员谴责保守党政府在也门地区狂轰滥炸，外交大臣劳埃德居然凶神恶煞似地喊叫：进行轰炸是在也门地区“维持法律和秩序的唯一可行的办法。”
    这样看来，英国的殖民主义者并没有从侵略埃及的失败中学到了一点乖。谁都知道，英国和它的同盟者曾经在塞得港投掷过不算少的炸弹，但是他们并没有能在埃及推行他们的丛林法律和恢复他们的殖民秩序。那末，这些还在摸着刚挨过打的屁股喊痛的英国绅士们，现在又怎么认为他们能够用另外一批炸弹使另外一个地方的人民对他们屈膝呢？
    这些新的拜物教徒比起原始的同道还要愚昧百倍。　（瑞）
