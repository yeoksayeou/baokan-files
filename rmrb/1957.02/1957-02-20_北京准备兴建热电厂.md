Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The technical design for the Beijing Thermal Power Plant construction project, which is being fully assisted by the Soviet Union, has been completed, and preparations are underway for construction. The main plant building will begin construction in the third quarter of this year, and the first generating unit will be put into production next year.

    The total capacity of the power generating equipment for the Beijing Thermal Power Plant is set at 200,000 kilowatts. The construction project will be carried out in two phases, with the first phase expected to be completed in 1959.

    In recent years, the capital's industrial production and residential construction have grown significantly. Although the Guanting Hydroelectric Power Plant has been newly built, the demand for electricity from industrial users and residents has grown rapidly. In particular, the early completion of the national Five-Year Plan has created a tight power supply situation. Once this thermal power plant is completed, it will not only generate a large amount of electricity, gradually changing this power shortage situation, but will also transmit a large amount of heat (steam and hot water) for industrial production and people's lives in the surrounding areas.

    This thermal power plant is being built with the assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has not only assigned experts to help select the plant site, design the project, and guide future construction, but is also responsible for supplying the equipment. The turbines and boilers are all the latest Soviet models, with high temperature and pressure, high efficiency, and low coal consumption. In the first phase of the project, the largest heat-supply turbine in our country, which is the latest Soviet equipment, will be installed. The operation of the main equipment of the entire plant will be automatically adjusted and controlled by electronic regulators.

    北京准备兴建热电厂
    据新华社19日讯　苏联全面援助的北京热电厂建厂工程，技术设计已经完成，正在做施工前的准备工作。主厂房工程将在今年第三季动工，第一台机组在明年就能投入生产。
    北京热电厂发电设备的总容量定为二十万瓩。建厂工程分两期进行，第一期工程预计在1959年完工。
    最近几年来，首都工业生产和住宅建筑有很大增长，虽然新建了官厅水力发电厂，但是由于工业用户和居民用电的需要增长很快，特别是国家五年计划提前完成，形成电力供应紧张状况。这个热电厂建成以后，不仅可以发出巨大的电力，逐步改变这种缺电情况，还将输送出大量热力（蒸气和热水），供给周围的工业生产和市民生活使用。
    这个热电厂是苏联帮助建设的。苏联政府不仅指派专家帮助选择厂址，作工程设计和指导将来的施工，还负责供应设备。汽轮机和锅炉都是苏联最新型的，高温高压，效率高，煤耗低。在第一期工程中，将安装一台我国最大的供热式汽轮机，是苏联最新的设备。全厂主要设备的运行，将由电子调整器自动调节和控制。
