Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 22nd: The streets of Jakarta today are filled with red and white flags (the Indonesian flag). People are celebrating the announcement of the Sukarno Plan with excitement.

Last night, people were posting and writing slogans everywhere all night, especially the youth. This morning, slogans can be seen on the walls of many houses, on roadside billboards, and on train and tram carriages, reading: "Support and Implement the Sukarno Plan," "Great Unity of All Indonesian Nationalities," "Drive Out Dutch Imperialism," and so on. In public places, people are talking about the Sukarno Plan with great interest.

A delegation of farmers from the suburbs of Jakarta called on Sukarno early this morning, offering their agricultural products to express their respect and support for the President's plan.

Suwirjo, Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, told reporters from the "Dongxing Bao" on the evening of February 21st, after the announcement of the Sukarno Plan, that the Central Committee of the Indonesian Nationalist Party will stand behind Sukarno and fully support his plan.

D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, also told reporters from this newspaper that the Indonesian Communist Party will work even harder to achieve national unity.

Sjafruddin Zuri, spokesman for the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, told reporters today that his party has decided on its final attitude towards President Sukarno's political reform plan. However, in order to maintain a good atmosphere so that people can study and decide their attitude towards this issue, his party has decided not to announce its attitude at this time.

Kattawiinata, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Indonesian Islamic League Party, said that he now supports and will continue to support any efforts made to achieve national peace. When reporters asked him which parts of the President's plan his party could accept and which parts it could not accept, Kattawiinata declined to answer the question.

Johannes Leimena, Chairman of the Indonesian Christian Party, and Sukiman, Vice Chairman of the Masyumi Party, told reporters that they would discuss Sukarno's plan.

The largest Indonesian veterans organization, the All-Indonesia Veterans Association, guaranteed in a statement today its fullest support for the President's plan.

An editorial in today's "Dongxing Bao" stated that the establishment of a national committee and cabinet including all parties, as indicated in the Sukarno Plan, will be a rational basis for Indonesia's democratic system. In this way, Indonesia will have a new political system that will be able to unite all the forces of the Indonesian people for national construction and lead the country to prosperity.

An editorial in the "Republic" also believes that the establishment of a cooperative cabinet and a national committee will realize peace for the Indonesian nation, and national peace is the basic condition for promoting the happiness and prosperity of the Indonesian nation.

The Masyumi Party's "Eternal Daily" still expressed opposition to the Indonesian Communist Party's participation in the cabinet in today's editorial. While praising Sukarno's efforts to solve the country's difficult problems, the newspaper also spread arguments expressing opposition to and suspicion of the Sukarno Plan, even suggesting that the Sukarno Plan might cause new difficulties. Some newspapers close to the Indonesian Socialist Party have tried their best to denigrate the Sukarno Plan.

    雅加达群众欢庆苏加诺方案的诞生
    据新华社雅加达22日电　今天雅加达的大街小巷到处飘扬着红白旗（印度尼西亚国旗）。人们以兴奋的心情欢庆苏加诺方案的公布。
    昨天晚上，人们整夜到处张贴和书写标语，青年们尤其活跃。今天早上，在许多住宅的墙壁上、路边的广告牌上以及火车、电车的车厢上，都可以看到标语，写的是：“拥护和实现苏加诺方案”，“全印度尼西亚民族大团结”，“赶走荷兰帝国主义”等。在公共场所，人群都在关心地谈论着苏加诺方案。
    雅加达郊区的一个农民代表团今天一清早进见苏加诺，他们献上了自己生产的农产品，表示对总统方案的敬重和拥护。
    印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约21日晚在苏加诺方案公布以后对“东星报”记者说，印度尼西亚国民党中央委员会将站在苏加诺背后，全力支持他的方案。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地也向这家报纸的记者说，印度尼西亚共产党将更加努力地工作，以实现民族的团结。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会发言人赛福鼎·朱里今天对新闻记者们说，他的党已经决定了它对苏加诺总统的政治改革方案的最后态度。但是，为了保持良好的气氛而使人民得以研究和决定他们对这个问题的态度，他的党决定目前不公布它的态度。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党执行委员会主席卡塔威纳塔说，他现在支持而且将继续支持为实现全国和平而作的任何努力。当新闻记者问及他的党能接受总统方案中的哪些部分以及不能接受哪些部分的时候，卡塔威纳塔不肯回答这个问题。
    印度尼西亚基督教党主席来梅纳和马斯友美党副主席苏基曼对新闻记者说，他们就要讨论苏加诺的方案。
    最大的印度尼西亚退伍军人组织、全印度尼西亚退伍军人协会今天在声明中保证最充分地支持总统的方案。
    “东星报”今天的社论说，成立苏加诺方案所指出的包括各党派的全国委员会和内阁，将是印度尼西亚的民主制度的合理基础。这样，印度尼西亚将有一个新的政治制度，将能够团结印度尼西亚人民的一切力量进行国家建设，使国家走向繁荣。
    “共和国报”的社论也认为，合作内阁和全国委员会的成立将能实现印度尼西亚民族的和平，而民族和平是促进印度尼西亚民族幸福和繁荣的基本条件。
    马斯友美党的“永恒日报”在今日的社论中仍然表示反对印度尼西亚共产党参加内阁。这家报纸表示赞扬苏加诺对解决国家困难问题所作的努力，但是，它又散布对苏加诺方案表示反对和怀疑的论调，甚至提出苏加诺方案可能引起新的困难的说法。有个别接近印度尼西亚社会党的报纸极力诋毁苏加诺方案。
