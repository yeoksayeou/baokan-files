    Oppose Randomly Pulling People Out of the Countryside
    In our area (Xinli Township, Taonan County, Jilin Province), a very bad trend has emerged. Many people, through private introductions from relatives and friends working in state-owned mines and farms, are flocking here to transfer their household registrations and move their families. In the past month alone, thirteen people from our township have gone out to find work.
    Why is this happening again? Mainly because when some units add personnel, they don't go through the labor departments; instead, they use personal connections to introduce jobs to their relatives and friends. It is understood that there have been three such incidents in our township recently. For example, Shi Qingyu, a staff member of the security section of the state-owned Chahayang Farm in Heilongjiang, wrote to five or six relatives and friends from his original residence (Maohao Village), telling them to go to him, promising to find them jobs. Another example is Fan Xizeng, a technician at the Taonan Local State-Owned May First Paper Mill, who wrote to his relative Liang Wanfu, telling him that the paper mill would be increasing staff and asking him to go to the city first and wait for the factory to recruit people, and also wrote a letter of proof to the local government to transfer his household registration. This has influenced many young people to be unwilling to engage in agricultural production and to run around looking for work, which hinders production, wastes money, and creates difficulties for the government's work.
    We firmly oppose this practice.

    In the Yaocun Central Agricultural Cooperative of Lin County, Henan Province, many young and middle-aged people are moving to other places to find work without transferring their household registrations or taking grain coupons. When our cooperative transitioned to an advanced cooperative last year, there were more than 1,500 laborers, but now there are only more than 1,100.
    Our cooperative has lost many laborers, and agricultural production has been greatly threatened. This is a major issue related to increasing national grain and cotton production this year, and we hope that relevant departments will quickly help resolve it.

### 反对从农村乱拉人出去

    反对从农村乱拉人出去
    在我们这里（吉林省洮南县新立乡），出现了一种很不好的风气。不少人通过现在国营矿山和农场工作的亲戚、朋友的私人介绍，纷纷前来转户口和搬家。近一月来，全乡就有十三人出去找工作。
    为什么又出现这种情况呢？主要是不少单位增添人员时，不是经过一定的劳动部门，而是利用私人关系给自己亲戚、朋友介绍工作。据了解，最近我们乡里就有过三次这样的事情。如黑龙江国营查哈阳农场保卫科工作人员时庆玉，曾给他原住处（茂好屯）五、六名亲友来信，叫他们到他那里去，保证给他们找到工作。又如洮南地方国营五一造纸厂技术员范喜增，给亲戚梁万富来信，告诉他纸厂将要增加人，要求他先到城内去住，等工厂要人的时候就给他介绍，同时并给当地政府写了转户口的证明信。这影响了很多青年不安心农业生产，纷纷跑到各处去找工作，既妨碍了生产，又浪费了钱，并给政府工作造成了一些困难。
    我们坚决反对这种做法。

    河南省林县姚村中心农业社，有好些青壮年不转户口，也不带粮票，自流地往外地去找工作。我社在去年转高级社的时候，共有劳动力一千五百多个，到现在只有一千一百多个了。
    我们社由于失去很多劳动力，农业生产已受到了很大威胁。这是一个关系到今年国家粮棉增产的大事，希望有关部门迅速帮助解决。
