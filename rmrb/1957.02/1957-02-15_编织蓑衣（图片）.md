    Weaving Raincoats
    Raincoats woven from palm fibers are a type of rain gear favored by farmers in the Jiangnan region. Members of the Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Songnan Township, Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, possess weaving skills passed down from their predecessors. Now, they treat weaving raincoats as a sideline production. This is a female member of the Victory Cooperative weaving a raincoat.
