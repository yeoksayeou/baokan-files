    The Soviet heavy machinery manufacturing industry is changing with each passing day.
    Last year, it manufactured the world's first automatic mobile combined machine for drilling vertical shafts, a new type of automatic excavator capable of excavating five to seven million cubic meters of fuel per year, and a new crane capable of lifting 400 tons; this year, it will manufacture 170 new types of machines.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th - This year, the Soviet heavy machinery manufacturing industry will manufacture approximately 170 new types of machines for heavy industrial sectors such as fuel, mining, metallurgy, and power, in order to further improve the production technology of these important industrial sectors.
    Last year, the Soviet heavy machinery manufacturing industry had already created many new machines for various heavy industrial sectors. Many giant combined machines meet the highest requirements of modern world technology. The Ural Machine-Building Plant successfully manufactured the world's first automatic mobile combined machine for drilling vertical shafts. It is 16.5 meters high and can drill shafts of various depths with a diameter of 6.5 meters, advancing 180 to 200 meters per month, which is five to six times faster than ordinary drilling machines. A newly manufactured continuous cold rolling mill for tinplate and thin flat steel, adopted by the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine, can roll more than 25 meters of flat steel per second. Among the many newly created powerful excavators, cranes, and other machines used in the mining industry and construction projects last year, a huge new type of automatic mobile excavator for mining open-pit coal mines is of great interest, as it can excavate five to seven million cubic meters of fuel per year. The New Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant manufactured a new type of crane for installation projects for the Bratsk Hydropower Station construction site that can lift 400 tons.
    Last year, Soviet heavy machinery manufacturing workers also created some giant turbines and boilers for power engineering. For the first time in Soviet history, they manufactured boilers capable of producing 540 tons and 660 tons of steam per hour, as well as hydraulic combined machines with power generation capacities of 150,000, 200,000, and 300,000 kilowatts.

    苏联重型机器制造业日新月异
    去年已制成了世界上第一台钻掘垂直矿井的自动移动联合机，一年能开采五百万到七百万立方公尺燃料的新型自动挖掘机，能起重四百吨的新式起重机；今年还将制造一百七十种新型机器。
    新华社莫斯科9日电　今年，苏联重型机器制造工业将为燃料、采矿、冶金、动力等重工业部门制造出约一百七十种新型机器，以便进一步改进这些重要工业部门的生产技术。
    苏联重型机器制造工业去年已经为各重工业部门创制了许多新机器。许多巨型联动机都符合世界现代技术的最高要求。乌拉尔机器制造厂制造成功世界上第一台钻掘垂直矿井的自动移动联合机。它高十六点五公尺，可以钻直径为六点五公尺的各种深度的矿井，一个月钻进一百八十到二百公尺，比普通钻机的钻进速度快五、六倍。马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合工厂采用的一台新制成的白铁皮和薄扁钢连续冷轧机，每秒钟能轧制二十五公尺以上扁钢。在采矿工业和建设工程中去年采用的许多种新创制的效力强大的挖掘机、起重机和其他机器中，一种用于开采露天煤矿的巨大的新型自动移动挖掘机非常有趣，它一年中能开采五百万到七百万立方公尺的燃料。新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器制造厂为布拉次克水电站工地制造的一种安装工程用的新式起重机能起重四百吨。
    苏联重型机器制造工人去年还为动力工程创制了一些巨型的涡轮机和锅炉。在苏联历史上，他们头一次制造出每小时能生产出五百四十吨和六百六十吨蒸汽的锅炉，以及发电能力为十五万、二十万和三十万瓩的水力联动机。
