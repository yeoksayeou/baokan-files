Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 24th. The Vietnamese Ministry of Health and Welfare recently issued a notice emphasizing that medical personnel should strengthen research on traditional medicine, and highlighting the coordination of traditional and Western medicine.

Prior to this, the Ministry of Health and Welfare had already established a Traditional Medicine Department to lead the organization and research work related to traditional medicine, and had hired experienced traditional medicine practitioners to participate in this work.

According to the head of the Traditional Medicine Department, traditional medicine is a combination of Chinese medicine and Vietnamese medicine, and its methods of treatment are basically the same as those of Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine was introduced to Vietnam more than two thousand years ago, and currently more than 70% of Vietnamese people are treated by traditional medicine when they are ill. In Hanoi alone, there are more than 220 Chinese and traditional medicine shops selling medicinal materials or pills, powders, and plasters. Medicinal herbs for treating diseases with traditional medicine grow widely in the mountainous areas of North Vietnam.

During the French colonial period, traditional medicine was subjected to exclusion and suppression. After the restoration of peace, the traditional medicine community spontaneously organized four Traditional Medicine Associations and one Chinese Medicine Association to engage in research and development of traditional medicine.

    越南加强研究东医学
    新华社河内24日电　越南医济部最近发出通知，强调医务人员要加强研究东医学，强调东医和西医配合。
    在这以前，医济部已经设立了一个东医处，领导有关东医的组织和研究工作，并且聘请了具有丰富医疗经验的东医师参加这项工作。
    据东医处的负责人说，东医是中医和越南医的结合体，治病的方法与中医基本相同。中医是在两千年以前传入越南的，目前70％以上的越南人有了病是由东医医治。仅河内市就有二百二十多家出售药材或膏丹丸散的中药铺和东药铺。在北越山区普遍生长着东医治病的药草。
    在法国统治时期，东医曾经受到排挤和打击。和平恢复后，东医界自动组织了四个东医联合会和一个中医联合会从事研究和发展东医的工作。
