Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 20th: The entire 3,690-kilometer length of the Volga River in the Soviet Union will be fully navigable throughout this year's shipping season. A series of hydropower station cascades and "artificial seas"—the Gorky Sea, the Rybinsk Sea, the Kuibyshev Sea, and other artificial reservoirs—built on this longest river in Europe have changed the past situation where the upper reaches of the Volga were full of shallows hindering navigation and the lower reaches lacked sufficient depth. Now, the water depth of the entire river channel is suitable for navigation throughout the entire shipping season. Travel enthusiasts can take interesting trips on the Volga River by boat at any time during this year's shipping season.

Of particular note is the "Kuibyshev Sea" that appeared at the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station more than a year ago. It is the largest on the Volga River and currently the largest artificial reservoir in the world. According to a TASS reporter from Kuibyshev, the "Kuibyshev Sea" is still being filled. In another three or four months, its water level will rise another seven meters. At that time, the reservoir will enter a stable state, and the water of the reservoir will extend 500 kilometers upstream along the Volga River and 200 kilometers upstream along its tributaries, the Kama River and the Cheremshan River. This artificial sea will be up to 50 kilometers wide and 40 meters deep in some places. The total area of the reservoir's water surface is more than 6,000 square kilometers, exceeding Lake Vänern (Sweden), the largest in Western Europe, and ten times the size of Hungary's famous Lake Balaton. By the end of this year, when the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station is fully completed, 2,000 cubic meters of water per second will flow out of the reservoir through its turbines.

    一系列水电站梯级和“人工海”改变了面貌
    伏尔加河七千多里将全部通航
    据新华社莫斯科20日电　在今年的整个航运季中，苏联全长三千六百九十公里的伏尔加河将全部通航。在这条欧洲最长的河上建设的一系列水电站梯级和“人工海”——“高尔基海”、“律平斯克海”、“古比雪夫海”和其他人工水库，已经改变了过去伏尔加河上游布满了阻碍航行的浅滩和下游水深不够的情况，而使得全部河道的水深在整个航期中都适于航行。旅行爱好者在今年航期的任何时候都可以乘船在伏尔加河上作有趣的旅行。
    特别引人注意的是一年多前在古比雪夫水电站那里出现的“古比雪夫海”，它是伏尔加河上最大的也是目前全世界最大的人工水库。据塔斯社记者从古比雪夫报道，“古比雪夫海”现在正在继续充水。三、四个月以后，它的水平面还将升高七公尺。那时候，水库就进入稳定状态，水库的水将沿伏尔加河向上扩展五百公里，沿着它的支流卡马河和契列姆吉河向上扩展二百公里。这个人工海在某些地方将宽达五十公里，深达四十公尺，水库的水面的总面积有六千多平方公里，超过西欧最大的维?尔恩湖（瑞典），为匈牙利著名的巴拉顿湖的十倍。今年年底，当古比雪夫水电站完全建成的时候，经过它的透平机每秒钟从水库流出的水将有两千立方公尺。
