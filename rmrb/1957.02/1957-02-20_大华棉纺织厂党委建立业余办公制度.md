Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 19th: The Chinese Communist Party Committee of the joint state-private Dahua Cotton Textile Factory has established an after-hours office system, helping workers solve many production and life-related issues, and is widely welcomed by the workers.

The factory's after-hours office is composed of 66 leading cadres from the factory's Party organization, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, who take turns on duty during after-hours time on Mondays and Fridays. They delve into workers' dormitories to understand the living and ideological situation of workers and their families, as well as their opinions on various aspects. Since the after-hours office began operating in December of last year, more than 200 employees have put forward more than 300 suggestions, opinions, and requests, including issues related to production, enterprise management, cadre work style, labor discipline, and welfare. Most of these opinions have been answered and addressed. For suggestions and requests that workers have made that are temporarily difficult to resolve, the cadres participating in the after-hours office have also patiently explained the situation. After understanding the actual situation, the workers have also expressed their determination to overcome temporary difficulties.

    大华棉纺织厂党委建立业余办公制度
    据新华社西安19日电　中共公私合营大华棉纺织厂委员会建立业余办公制度，帮助工人解决了许多有关生产和生活的问题，受到工人普遍欢迎。
    这个厂的业余办公室，由这个厂的党组织、行政、工会和青年团等方面负责干部六十六人编成小组，在每星期一、五的业余时间轮流值班，深入职工宿舍了解工人及家属的生活、思想情况和对各方面的意见。自去年12月业余办公室开始办公以来，有二百多个职工提出了三百多条建议、意见和要求，其中包括有关生产、企业管理、干部作风、劳动纪律、生活福利等问题。这些意见已经大部分作了答复和处理。对于工人提出的暂时难以解决的建议和要求，参加业余办公室的干部也都很耐心地进行了解释。工人了解了实际情况后，也都表示要坚决克服暂时的困难。
