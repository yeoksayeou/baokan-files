Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 1st: The Algerian National Liberation Front recently issued an appeal, requesting the Arab people, who have consistently supported the Algerian cause, to hold demonstrations during the general strike of the Algerian people to support their struggle. Algeria has been holding an eight-day general strike since January 28th to show the world the firm will of the Algerian people to demand national independence while the United Nations discusses the Algerian issue.

The appeal calls on the people of Tunisia and Morocco to unite with the Algerian people, so that "French colonialism knows that Algeria is an indivisible part of North Africa, and that Tunisia and Morocco will not cease fighting until the entire North Africa is liberated from the shackles of colonialism."

Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: Tunis dispatch: Residents of Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, held a strike and closed shops on the morning of the 30th to express their support for the general strike held by the Algerian people. From 8:00 a.m. to noon on the 30th, stores in Tunis were closed, and public transportation workers also stopped working.

Government employees and railway workers took another way to express their solidarity, donating money to the Algerian people in struggle. Railway workers decided to donate one day's salary each.

Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: Casablanca dispatch: The Moroccan Istiqlal Democratic Party called on Moroccans on the 29th to hold a strike on the 30th to "express their support for the cause of the Algerians and solidarity with the Algerians."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 31st: The Secretariat of the International Union of Students stated in a telegram that it "deeply sympathizes with and supports the Algerian students who are fighting against colonialism alongside their people."

    政府工作人员和铁路工人采取了另一种声援方式，他们捐款给斗争中的阿尔及利亚人民。铁路工人决定每人捐出一天的工资。
    新华社31日讯　卡萨布兰卡消息：摩洛哥独立民主党29日号召摩洛哥人在30日举行罢工，以“表示他们支持阿尔及利亚人的事业和同阿尔及利亚人团结一致”。
    据新华社布拉格31日电　国际学生联合会秘书处在一封电报中表示，它“深深同情并且支持同他们的人民一道对殖民主义作斗争的阿尔及利亚学生”。
