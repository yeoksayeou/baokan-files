Yunnan's Chuxiong Special District
Implementing the Livestock Breeding Responsibility System Has Led to Significant Development in Animal Husbandry Production

    (Our report) Animal husbandry production in Yunnan's Chuxiong Special District has seen further development. By the end of last year, there were 1,410,000 head of livestock including sheep, cattle, horses, and mules, an increase of 13.2% compared to 1955. Over the past year, agricultural cooperatives have gained some experience in livestock breeding and management. More than 90% of the agricultural cooperatives in the district have established management organizations and designated specialized personnel to be responsible. More than 80% of the cooperative members in the district have implemented a "four-guarantee" (guaranteeing division of labor, breeding, good condition, and fertilizer) or "five-guarantee" (adding a guarantee of costs) responsibility system and a system of rewards for overproduction of livestock. This management method has greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm and strengthened the sense of responsibility of the livestock keepers, thus gradually reducing the phenomena of large-scale livestock deaths and emaciation.

    云南楚雄专区
    实行饲养责任制度  畜牧生产大有发展
    本报讯　云南楚雄专区畜牧业生产有了进一步的发展。到去年年底，已有羊、牛、马、骡等各种牲畜一百四十一万只，比1955年增加了13.2％。一年来，各农业社在牲畜的繁殖和管理上都取得了一些经验。全区有90％以上的农业社都设有管理机构，指定了专人负责。全区80％以上的社员在实行了牲畜“四包”（包分工、包繁殖、包膘气、包肥料）或“五包”（加包成本）的责任制和超产奖励制度。这种管理的方法，大大激发了饲养员的劳动积极性，加强了责任心，因而牲畜大量死亡和瘦弱的现象逐渐减少。　（云南日报编辑部）
