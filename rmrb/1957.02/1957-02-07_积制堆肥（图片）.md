    Making Compost Heaps
    With the help of local agricultural technology promotion stations, many agricultural cooperatives in the Changde area of Hunan Province are working hard to learn how to make compost heaps. The Xinchang Agricultural Cooperative in Shimen County has already made forty-two heaps (more than 70,000 dan); cadres from the local agricultural technology promotion station are helping to check the fermentation of the compost.

    积制堆肥
    湖南省常德地区许多农业社在当地农业技术推广站的帮助下，努力学习积制堆肥。石门县新厂农业社已经堆制了四十二堆（七万多担）；当地农业技术推广站干部正在帮助检查堆肥发酵情况。	　李贤祺摄（新华社稿）
