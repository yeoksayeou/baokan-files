Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, February 4th: As of January 28th, seventy-four producers from Qingdao's eight state-owned cotton textile factories and the joint state-private Hua Xin Textile and Dyeing Factory had emerged as advanced individuals, consistently maintaining their advanced status for twelve consecutive months. According to the Qingdao Textile Bureau and the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union's regulations on socialist competition evaluation and reward methods, they recently received the honorary title of Advanced Producer of Qingdao Textile Industry and an honorary certificate of "Learn from each other, help each other, draw on strengths, overcome weaknesses, and improve together."
    Over the past year, this group of advanced producers has achieved outstanding results and valuable experience in improving product quality, practicing thrift, ensuring output, and maintaining safe production. Factories have already summarized and promoted some of these valuable experiences, while others are being studied and summarized in preparation for promotion.
    This group of advanced producers has consistently achieved excellence since the end of 1955, meeting advanced targets every month in the advanced producer movement. The vast majority of them have extremely close ties with the masses around them. Advanced producer Song Guihua is a winding machine operator in the preparation workshop of the joint state-private Hua Xin Textile and Dyeing Factory. In the second quarter of last year, when the workshop summarized and promoted her operating experience of producing no defective yarn bobbins, she was patient and meticulous in her instruction, so workers were willing to learn from her. Now, 87% of the operators in the entire workshop have skillfully and accurately mastered her operating experience.

    青岛一批先进生产者
    月月达到先进指标
    新华社青岛4日电　截至1月28日为止，青岛市八个国营棉纺织厂和公私合营华新纺织染厂涌现出七十四名连续十二个月都能保持先进的生产者。根据青岛纺织管理局、中国纺织工会青岛市委员会关于社会主义竞赛评比奖励办法规定，最近获得了市纺织工业先进生产者的光荣称号和“互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”的荣誉奖状。
    一年来，这批先进生产者，在提高产品质量、厉行节约，保证产量和安全生产等方面，都创造了优异的成绩和宝贵的经验。各厂对这些宝贵经验，有的已经总结和推广了，有的正在研究总结，准备推广。
    这批先进生产者从1955年底开始，月月都连续获得优胜，在先进生产者运动中，月月都达到先进指标。他们当中的绝大部分都同自己周围的群众有着极为密切的联系。先进生产者宋桂花是公私合营华新纺织染厂准备车间的络经值车工，这个车间在去年第二季度总结推广她不出坏纱筒子的操作经验中，由于她在传授中既耐心又细致，因此，工人都愿跟她学。现在全车间有87％的值车工都熟练、准确地掌握了她的操作经验。
