Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 29th: The first phase of the Longchi Hydropower Station, built on Wanping, Yan'er River, Mount Emei, Sichuan, has been completed and generated electricity on the 28th.

	The power generation of this phase is 2,160 kilowatts, which can supply more than half of the electricity consumption of dozens of factories and mines in the Leshan and Emei areas that produce silk, paper, alkali, coal, fertilizer, and cement. The power generation cost is about 50% lower than that of the Minjiang Thermal Power Plant, which originally supplied part of the electricity to these factories and mines.

	This hydropower station was entirely designed by engineering and technical personnel from Sichuan Province, and all equipment is made in China.

	Yan'er River is one of the many small rivers on Mount Emei. Its characteristics are clean river water, normal flow, and a large drop in water level. While completing the first phase of the Longchi Hydropower Station, part of the plant buildings and canals for the second phase have been built. At the same time, the surveying and exploration work for the Kuqiaoping Reservoir, located upstream of the Yan'er River on the hillside of Mount Emei, has also been basically completed.

    峨眉山上修电站
    新华社成都29日电　修在四川峨眉山燕儿河上万坪的龙池水电站第一期工程完工，在28日发电。
    这期工程的发电量是二千一百六十瓩，可以供给乐山、峨眉一带生产丝、纸、碱、煤、肥料和水泥等产品的几十个厂矿用电量的一半以上，发电成本比原来供给这些厂矿部分电力的岷江火电厂低50％左右。
    这个水电站完全是由四川省的工程技术人员设计的，全部设备也都用国产品。
    燕儿河是峨眉山许多条小河之一。它的特点是河水清洁，流量正常，水位落差大。龙池水电站在完成第一期工程的同时，已经修好了第二期工程的部分厂房和渠道；同时座落在峨眉山腰的燕儿河上游的苦荞坪水库的测量和钻探工作，也已经基本上完成。
