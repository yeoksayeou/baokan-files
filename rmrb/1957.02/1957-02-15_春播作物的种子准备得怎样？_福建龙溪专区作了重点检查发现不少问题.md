How is the Preparation of Spring Planting Crop Seeds?
    Longxi Special District in Fujian Conducted a Key Inspection and Discovered Many Problems
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Longxi Special District in Fujian Province recently organized cadres from seed stations and agricultural technology extension stations to go to the countryside to conduct key inspections of the seed storage and management situation of agricultural cooperatives, and to guide agricultural cooperatives in preparing enough seeds for spring planting.
    During the inspection, various counties found that some agricultural cooperatives lacked seeds or had seeds of poor quality. Dongshan County was short of 44,000 jin of seeds according to the requirements for expanding the planting area of ​​Nante No. 1 early rice, and also lacked more than 140,000 jin of early peanut seeds; in Yunxiao County, the Xihe Township agricultural cooperative inspected seven production teams and found that six teams' seeds were infested with insects, with severe cases showing 82 out of 300 sampled seeds being damaged by insect pests, resulting in a loss rate of 27%. Through inspection, all agricultural cooperatives have screened and dried the insect-infested seeds, and selected experienced members to be responsible for storage; those with insufficient seed retention have taken measures such as mutual exchange and transfer to solve the problem.

    春播作物的种子准备得怎样？
    福建龙溪专区作了重点检查发现不少问题
    本报讯　龙溪专区各县最近组织种子站、农业技术推广站干部下乡重点检查农业社种子贮备保管情况，指导农业社准备足够春季播种的种子。
    各县在检查中发现，一部分农业社缺种子或种子质量低劣。东山县按扩大南特号早稻种植面积的要求，尚缺四万四千斤种子，早花生种子也缺十四万多斤；云霄县下河乡农业社检查七个生产队中有六个队的种子有虫害，其中严重的在取样的三百粒种子中，有八十二粒受虫蛀害，损失率达27％。通过检查，各农业社都把有虫害种子进行过筛、晒干，并选择有经验社员负责保管；留种不够的采取互相串换调剂等办法予以解决。
