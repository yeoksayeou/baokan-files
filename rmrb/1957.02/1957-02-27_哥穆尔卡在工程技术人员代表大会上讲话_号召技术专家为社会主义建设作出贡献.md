Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 26th: Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, on the 24th called on Polish technical experts to advance along the socialist path planned by the Party and make due contributions to the development of the national economy and the promotion of technological progress.

Approximately 3,000 representatives of Polish engineers and technicians began their Third National Congress of Engineers and Technicians in Warsaw on this day. The task of the congress is to discuss issues such as technical improvements in various sectors of the Polish national economy and the tasks and roles of engineering and technical personnel.

In his speech at the congress, Gomułka pointed out that the Polish people had achieved the greatest accomplishments in their history over the past twelve years. He said that although many mistakes had been made in the past, we can look forward to the future with confidence because our country's further economic development now has a solid foundation.

Gomułka mentioned that Poland has undergone enormous development since the first post-war engineers' congress in December 1946. In 1946, Poland produced 5.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, while now, in 1957, it will produce 21.6 billion kilowatt-hours. The annual steel production at that time was 1.2 million tons, while today it is almost 5.4 million tons. He said that during this period, we have learned to manufacture automobiles, tractors, refine aluminum, manufacture jet aircraft, and many modern machines, radar, semiconductors, and so on.

Gomułka went on to say that the Five-Year Plan sets out new and important tasks. It is expected that industrial production and the people's living standards will be greatly improved. In order to achieve these goals, labor productivity must be greatly improved. Only with modern technology, especially mechanization, automation, and improved production processes, can the improvement of labor productivity be guaranteed. This is a necessary prerequisite for completing the goals of the Five-Year Plan.

Gomułka said that engineers in administrative departments must be transferred to production departments. Research institutions should be closer to planning institutions, and engineering and design personnel should be closer to factories and production units. The government has established a Technical Issues Committee to promote technological progress. We should learn from the experiences of other countries. We should learn the best technological achievements of both socialist and developed capitalist countries.

Gomułka believes that necessary reforms must continue to be carried out in the planning of the national economy and the methods of managing industry. However, in carrying out such reforms, action must be very cautious. Hasty decisions that are not based on practical experience will not only fail to improve the system but will also plunge the factory management system and the entire national economy into organizational chaos. We must also keep in mind that even the most perfect management system cannot solve the difficulties we face today in the supply of industrial raw materials. Correct economic policies and increasing raw material reserves from our own production and imported materials will solve the difficulties we face today.

Gomułka stressed that the Party and the government expect engineers and technicians to vigorously assist in overcoming economic difficulties and improving economic management. He said that Poland's great army of technical experts must advance with firm strides along the path planned by the Party, along the path of building and strengthening Poland's socialist system.

Gomułka finally stated that the Party and the government will create favorable conditions for engineering and technical personnel to carry out creative work and will support the correct and realistic demands of the congress.

    哥穆尔卡在工程技术人员代表大会上讲话
    号召技术专家为社会主义建设作出贡献
    新华社华沙26日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡在24日号召波兰的技术专家们沿着党所规划的社会主义道路前进，对发展国民经济和推动技术进步作出应有的贡献。
    波兰的工程技术人员代表约三千人，这一天在华沙开始举行第三次全国工程师、技术人员代表大会。大会的任务是讨论波兰国民经济各部门的技术改进和工程技术人员的任务、作用等问题。
    哥穆尔卡在大会上的讲话中指出，过去十二年波兰人民取得了历史上最伟大的成就。他说，虽然过去犯了许多错误，可是我们可以有信心地瞻望未来，因为现在我国经济的进一步发展有着巩固的基础。
    哥穆尔卡提到，从1946年12月举行战后第一次工程师代表大会以来，波兰已经有了巨大的发展。在1946年，波兰生产的电力是五十七亿度，而现在，在1957年，将生产二百一十六亿度。钢的年产量在当时是一百二十万吨，而今天几乎要达到五百四十万吨。他说，在这段时期里，我们学会了制造汽车、拖拉机，炼铝，制造喷气式飞机以及许多现代化的机器、雷达、半导体等。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，五年计划提出了新的重大任务。预计工业生产和人民生活水平将有很大的提高。为了达到这些目标，必须大大提高劳动生产率。只有靠现代化的技术，特别是机械化、自动化和改进生产过程，才能保证劳动生产率的提高。这是完成五年计划目标的必要前提。
    哥穆尔卡说，必须把行政部门的工程师调到生产部门去。研究机关应该更接近计划机关，工程和设计人员应该更接近工厂和生产单位。政府已经成立了一个技术问题委员会来促进技术的进步。我们应该利用其他国家的经验。社会主义国家的和发达的资本主义国家的最好的技术成就，我们都应该学习。
    哥穆尔卡认为，必须在计划国民经济以及管理工业的方法方面继续进行必要的改革。而在进行这种改革的时候，行动必须非常审慎。不以实际经验为基础的仓促决定，不但不会改善制度，反而会使工厂管理制度和整个国民经济陷于组织上的混乱。我们还必须牢牢记住，即使是最完善的管理制度也不能够解决我们今天所遇到的工业原料等供应上的困难。正确的经济政策以及从我们自己的生产和进口物资当中增加原料储备，将使我们今天面临的困难得到解决。
    哥穆尔卡强调指出，党和政府期待工程师、技术人员大力协助克服经济困难和改善经济管理。他说，波兰技术专家的大军必须以坚定步伐沿着党所规划的道路，沿着建设和加强波兰社会主义制度的道路前进。
    哥穆尔卡最后表示，党和政府要为工程技术人员进行创造性的工作创造有利条件，对代表大会的正确和现实的要求将给予支持。
