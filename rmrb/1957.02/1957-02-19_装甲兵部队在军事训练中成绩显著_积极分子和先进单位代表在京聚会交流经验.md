Xinhua News Agency, 18th - Commander of the Armored Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Xu Guangda, commended a group of outstanding officers and soldiers who have achieved remarkable results in military training at the opening of the Armored Forces Activists Representative Conference today.

    There are a total of four hundred and twenty-three activists and representatives of advanced units attending this meeting.

    General Xu Guangda said in his speech to them that, encouraged by the high tide of socialist construction, all officers of the armored forces launched a training upsurge last year, with greater training achievements than ever before. Especially in shooting and technical training, the achievements were even more remarkable, and a large number of excellent shooters who skillfully mastered their weapons emerged. For example, Sun Zhu, a platoon leader of the Second Company of a certain unit—a soldier who joined the army in 1955—scored five points in all courses of the test, and hit every shot in various shooting exercises and combat shooting, and was rated as a first-class excellent shooter. In the technical training last year, a large number of new driving technicians also emerged.

    General Xu Guangda pointed out that last year, the armored forces extended the use of vehicles by more than 35,800 hours, saving the country more than 7 million yuan. In the past year, the vast number of officers and soldiers put forward more than 4,800 rationalization proposals, of which more than 2,670 were adopted. These proposals are of great value to the improvement of various tasks.

    General Xu Guangda finally encouraged the representatives present to humbly learn and exchange experiences in order to implement the policy of building the army diligently and thriftily, and to build the armored forces into a highly combat-effective force to defend our socialist construction.

    装甲兵部队在军事训练中成绩显著
    积极分子和先进单位代表在京聚会交流经验
    新华社18日讯　中国人民解放军装甲兵司令员许光达大将，在今天开幕的装甲兵积极分子代表会议上，表扬了一批在军事训练中有显著成绩的优秀军官和战士。
    出席这次会议的积极分子和先进单位代表共有四百二十三名。
    许光达大将对他们讲话时说，装甲兵部队全体军官在社会主义建设高潮的鼓舞下，去年掀起了一个练兵高潮，训练成绩比过去任何时候都大。尤其在射击和技术训练方面，成绩更为显著，出现了大批熟练掌握手中武器的优等射手。例如某部二连炮长——1955年入伍的战士孙柱，各门课程的测验成绩都是五分，在各个射击练习和战斗射击中发发命中，被评为一等优秀射手。在去年的技术训练中，还涌现了大批新驾驶技师。
    许光达大将指出：去年装甲兵在延长车辆使用方面共达三万五千八百多小时，为国家节约七百多万元。在去年一年中，广大官兵提出了四千八百多件合理化建议，被采纳的就有二千六百七十多件。这些建议对各项工作的改进，都具有重要价值。
    许光达大将最后勉励到会的代表，虚心学习交流经验，以贯彻勤俭建军的方针，把装甲兵部队建设成为一支具有高度战斗威力的部队，保卫我们的社会主义建设。
