    Arda Agricultural Cooperative
    Bulgaria, I. Slavchev
    In the central part of the Rhodope Mountains, in the narrow valley of the Arda River, lies the village of Arda. According to the elders of the village, it is named after the river, which originates two or three kilometers away, almost near the border between Bulgaria and Greece.

    Arda village is a typical Rhodope town, located at an altitude of 1,200 to 1,300 meters above sea level. All 150 houses are built of stone, with roofs covered with slate that has turned gray with age. The houses are scattered on both sides of the river. Even now, there are two stone arch bridges built two or three hundred years ago spanning this river.

    The village, stretching along the Arda River, consists of six or seven mahalas (Turkish word, referring to residential clusters similar to neighborhoods), each with thirty or forty households, the largest of which is Sivino Mahala.

    Most of the villagers are Bulgarians who believe in Islam. Twelve years ago, their lives were so miserable that it is difficult for us to describe all the disasters the people suffered at that time. People lived in ignorance and darkness, bound by the fetters of religious fanaticism imposed by the Ahong. Women were in an even more powerless and enslaved position. They always wore veils, and didn't even dare to open their eyes in front of others. Moreover, selling one's daughter to a stranger was considered nothing to a father, even if he might never see his daughter again.

    The peasants ate nothing but corn. Only during the New Year or grand religious festivals did some families knead some dough to eat. The transportation of commodities such as potatoes and timber relied entirely on donkeys. Some Arda people had to trek on foot, a journey that now takes six or seven hours by car, to sell a bag of potatoes and buy a bag of corn, a bottle of kerosene, or a kilogram of salt. At that time, patients were treated with local herbs, and more commonly with prayers and incantations. Sometimes, patients had to ride donkeys, braving the cold or heat, crossing deep ravines and valleys, and traveling dozens of kilometers of rough roads to the nearest city, Asenovgrad, for medical treatment....

    All this, like sharp blades, left deep marks on people's hearts. All this is passed down in their songs, permeating their hidden pain and yearning for joy....

    More than a decade ago, the first seedlings of a new life in Arda village sprouted and grew through the long-standing darkness. Clinics, maternity hospitals, department stores, and restaurants have sprung up here one after another. Children and illiterate adults flooded into spacious schools like a spring tide.

    The director of the agricultural cooperative, Danailov, is a young man of medium build with a rectangular face and black eyes. In a calm voice, he said: "Let anyone who thinks we are bragging go ahead and think so. But whether others believe it or not, in these mountains, at such a high altitude, on such scattered fields, we have established an agricultural cooperative, which has been in existence for five or six years, and, importantly, the work here is not bad."

    The cooperative's Party Secretary, Haralampov, also works in the director's office. He added: "We established a cooperative sheep farm for the first time."

    In September 1950, one hundred and sixty Bulgarians and Bulgarian Muslims from Arda village and nearby mahalas organized themselves and embarked on a new path. At that time, they did not realize the great significance of this matter, which would later have a huge impact on hundreds of thousands of Rhodope residents.

    The Arda Agricultural Cooperative has entered its seventh year of establishment. In this not-so-long period, it has convincingly demonstrated the vitality of the cooperative system.

    Arda village has two cooperative farms and two livestock sheds and cowsheds. Sheepfolds have been built on the pastures, where the sheep spend the winter. Work teams are established according to the mahalas, and work livestock—oxen, donkeys, and farm implements—are also kept in the mahalas. Small field camps have been established, with farm implement depots, feed sheds, and sun-curing yards.

    By adopting some agronomic measures, such as deep plowing and topdressing, the members of the Arda cooperative have greatly increased their yields compared to individual farmers. The members harvested an average of 3,100 kilograms of potatoes per decare (one decare is equivalent to one and a half mu), while individual farmers harvested only 1,200 kilograms per decare. The same is true for tobacco: the cooperative harvested 140 to 160 kilograms of tobacco leaves per decare, while individual farmers harvested at most 80 kilograms, and the quality was poor. The dairy cows of the cooperative and the dairy cows of individual farmers are both of the "Balkan breed," but the annual milk yield per dairy cow in the cooperative reaches 1,100 to 1,200 liters, while that of individual farmers is only 600 to 700 liters.

    With the increase in yield per unit area, the income of the cooperative has also increased, thus greatly improving the lives of the members.

    "The work of concerted efforts has yielded good results, bringing us more and more income," said the director of the cooperative. "Therefore, we live better than individual farmers. For example, in 1955, our members received fourteen levs (Bulgarian currency) in cash and in kind for each work day. For us, this amount is not small; but, of course, it is not enough to guarantee that we live very well. We must strive to live better and richer."

    Danailov picked up a folder from his desk, looked at it carefully, put it aside, and continued:

    "Our harvest will continue to increase in the future. We should increase the annual milk yield per dairy cow to 1,600 to 1,700 liters. We must improve the quality of tobacco, which is one of the main economic crops of our cooperative. But that's not all. We have decided to plant new crops here."

    The director of the cooperative began to describe in detail how extensively they had learned about the possibility of planting raspberries and strawberries. In the future, they will plant these things, initially one hundred decares, and if the harvest is good (which they do not doubt), they will expand their planting area. Now they are intensifying their research on the possibility of planting lavender and flax, and they have already done a lot of work in this regard, and the transplant preparation process has ended.

    The lives of the Arda farmers are getting better and better. Things that people could not do or even dream of in the past are now being realized by the members of the cooperative themselves with the strong support of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Government. In the minds of every member of the cooperative, the cooperative system has become something inseparable from their flesh and blood.

    阿尔达农业合作社
    保加利亚　伊·斯拉夫切夫
    在东罗多彼山脉的中部，在狭窄的阿尔达河谷，有一个阿尔达村。据村里的老年人说，它是以河流得名的，这条河就发源于两三公里以外，差不多靠近保加利亚和希腊交界的地方。
    阿尔达村是一个典型的罗多彼的村镇，位于拔海一千二百到一千三百公尺的高地上。一百五十幢房屋全是石头砌的，屋顶盖的也是石板，因年深日久而变成灰色了。房屋分散在河的两岸。直到现在，还有两、三百年前建筑的两座石拱桥横跨在这条河上。
    沿阿尔达河伸展开的这个村镇，由六、七个玛哈拉（土耳其语，指类似街区的住宅群）组成，每个玛哈拉有三、四十户，其中最大的是西维诺玛哈拉。
    村里的居民大半是信奉伊斯兰教的保加利亚人。十二年以前，他们的生活还是那样悲惨，我们很难形容当时人民所遭受的一切灾难。人们生活在无知和黑暗中，被阿訇用宗教狂热的镣铐束缚起来。妇女处在更加无权的奴隶地位。她们永远蒙着面纱，甚至在别人面前不敢睁开自己的眼睛。而且，把自己的女儿卖给一个素昧平生的人，在做父亲的看来是不算什么的，哪怕他也许从此再也看不见他的女儿了。
    农民除了玉米以外，没有吃过别的东西。只有过年或逢到隆重的宗教节日，有些人家才搓些面团吃。马铃薯和木材等等商品的运输，全靠驴子来驮。有些阿尔达人为了卖出一袋马铃薯，买进一袋玉米、一瓶煤油或一公斤盐，就得徒步跋涉，现在坐汽车要走六、七小时的路程。那时，病人治病是用当地能够得到的草药，而更常用的方法是祈祷和念咒。有时病人去求医诊治，得骑着驴子，冒着严寒或酷暑，越过深涧和大谷，走几十公里坎坷不平的道路，到最近的城市阿谢诺夫格勒去……。
    这一切都像利刃一样在人们的心头刻下了深深的印痕。这一切都流传在他们的歌曲中，渗透了他们隐藏在心头的痛楚和对欢乐的憧憬……。
    十多年前，阿尔达村新生活的第一批幼芽，冲破长久以来的黑暗生长起来了。这里陆续出现了诊所、产院、百货商店和饭馆。儿童们以及不识字的成年人，像春潮般涌进宽敞的学校。
    农业合作社主任达纳伊洛夫是个中等身材的青年男子，长方脸，黑眼睛。他用沉静的声调说：“谁要是认为我们是在吹牛，那就由他去吧。可是，不管别人相信不相信，在这山区，在海拔这样高的地方，在这样分散的田地上，我们还是建立了农业合作社，它已经存在了五、六年，而且重要的是，这里的工作情况还不坏。”
    合作社党书记哈拉兰波夫也在主任办公室工作。他补充道：“我们第一次建立了合作育羊场。”
    在1950年9月，阿尔达村和附近一些玛哈拉的一百六十个保加利亚人和保加利亚伊斯兰教徒，组织起来，走上了新的道路。当时他们还不曾意识到，他们做的这桩往后会在成千上万的罗多彼居民中产生巨大影响的事情，有多么重要的意义。
    阿尔达农业社已经进入它成立以来的第七年。在这不算很长的时期中，它已令人信服地证明了合作制的生命力。
    阿尔达村有两个合作农场和两个饲畜舍和牛栏。在牧场上建立了羊圈，羊群就在那里过冬。工作队是按玛哈拉建立的，工作牲畜——犍牛、驴子以及农具，也按玛哈拉保管。建立了不大的田间野营，设有农具库、饲料棚和晒烟场等。
    由于采取了一些农艺措施，如深耕、追肥等等，阿尔达的合作社社员们比个体农民大大提高了自己的收成。社员们从每狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）土地收获的马铃薯平均达到三千一百公斤，而个体农民每狄卡尔只收一千二百公斤。烟草的情形也是这样：合作社每狄卡尔收一百四十到一百六十公斤烟叶，个体农民顶多收八十公斤，而且质量不好。合作社的乳牛和个体农民的乳牛都是“巴尔干种”，但是合作社每头乳牛一年的挤奶量达到一千一百到一千二百公升，而个体农民的只有六、七百公升。
    随着单位面积产量的提高，合作社的收入也增加了，因而大大改善了社员们的生活。
    “协同努力的工作得到了良好的结果，给我们带来了愈来愈多的收入。”合作社主任说，“因此，我们比个体农民生活得更好。例如在1955年，我们的社员每个劳动日得到十四列弗（保币名）现金和实物。对于我们说来，这个数目已经不少了；可是，当然啰，这还不足以保证我们过得十分富裕。我们要努力争取过得更好、更富裕。”
    达纳伊洛夫从写字台上拿起文件夹子，仔细端详了一番，又放到一旁，继续说道：
    “我们的收成今后还要提高。我们应当使每头乳牛一年的挤奶量达到一千六百到一千七百公升。我们必须改进烟草的质量，它是我们合作社的主要经济作物之一。但是，这还不算。我们已经决定在我们这里种植新的作物。”
    合作社主任开始详细地叙述他们怎样广泛地了解了种植树莓和草莓的可能性。将来他们要种这些东西，最初是一百狄卡尔，要是收成好（他们对此并不怀疑），还要扩大它们的种植面积。现在正加紧研究种植熏衣草和亚麻的可能性，并且在这方面已经做了不少工作，移植的准备过程已经结束了。
    阿尔达农民的生活过得越来越好了。从前人们做不到、甚至不能梦想的事情，现在都在保加利亚共产党和人民政府的大力支持下，由合作社社员们亲自动手实现了。在合作社每个成员的心目中，合作制度已经成为同他们血肉相连的东西了。　　（本报特约稿　孙乃译）
