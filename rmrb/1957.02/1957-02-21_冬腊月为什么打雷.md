Why Does it Thunder in the Winter Months?
Editor's Note: A reader from Zhang County, Gansu, wrote saying that on January 10th this year (the tenth day of the twelfth lunar month), around 12:00 midnight, thunder suddenly struck for five minutes in an area of about forty miles around the southwestern street of Zhang County, followed by heavy snowfall and a rapid change in the weather. Many people do not understand why it thunders in the winter months. Other readers have also reported the same issue. We are now publishing this short article for readers' reference.

On January 10th, a warm air mass entered the Longdong region from the Sichuan-Kangding River Valley, causing temperatures to rise generally in Wudu, Tianshui, Pingliang and other places. Comparing the temperature at 11:00 PM that night with the temperature at 11:00 PM the previous day, Tianshui increased by two degrees (Celsius), Pingliang increased by three degrees, and Wudu increased by ten degrees. Throughout the Longdong area, southwest and east winds were blowing. This shows that the warm air mass came from the southwest and was relatively warm and humid; however, the upper atmosphere was still very cold at that time, creating a situation of cold above and warm below, with very unstable air (because cold, heavy air sinks, and warm, light air rises). Around 12:00 midnight, new cold air arrived in Minxian, Huajialing, and other places, causing this warm air mass to rise sharply. At the same time, because Zhang County is located on the western foothills of Wushan, a branch of the Liupan Mountains, it accelerated the rate at which the airflow climbed along the slope. Therefore, the airflow above Zhang County was tumbling up and down, with strong convection, producing cumulonimbus clouds. When these clouds grew larger and raindrops fell downwards, they were impacted by other rising air currents, causing the raindrops to splash and split, resulting in ionization. When the electric charge reaches sufficient intensity, there will be lightning paths between cloud masses, and between cloud masses and the ground, and discharge will occur. When discharging, because a powerful high heat is generated, the local air volume suddenly expands, resulting in an explosion phenomenon, forming sparse and dense longitudinal waves. These sound waves enter people's ears, which is the thunder we hear.

It is rare for thunder to occur in the winter months. However, under conditions where the lower-level air warms up and is very unstable, if cold air suddenly arrives in the upper atmosphere, causing strong convection, thunder and rain clouds can be generated, making it possible for discharge and thunder to occur. On January 16, 1954, it occurred in Hankou. There was also thunder in Beijing in the winter of 1953. This is a natural weather phenomenon.

    冬腊月为什么打雷
    编者按　甘肃漳县读者来信说，今年1月10日（农历腊月初十）晚间十二点钟的时候，漳县西南街周围约四十里的地区，突然打了五分钟的雷，接着是大雪纷飞，天气转变很快。冬腊月为什么会打雷，许多人都不了解。还有其他读者也反映了同样的问题。现在特刊载这篇短文，供读者参考。
    1月10日，有一股暖空气从川康河谷进入陇东地区，以致武都、天水、平凉等地的气温都普遍升高。那天晚上十一点钟的气温同前一天十一点钟的比较，天水的增高了（摄氏）二度，平凉的增高了三度，武都的增高了十度。整个陇东地区，都刮西南风和东风。由此可见这股暖空气是来自西南，比较温暖潮湿；可是那时候的高空还是很寒冷的，形成上冷下热，空气很不稳定的局势（因为冷而重的空气往下沉，暖而轻的空气往上升）。到了十二点钟左右，岷县、华家岭等地，有新的冷空气到来，促使这一股暖空气急剧上升，同时因为漳县是在六盘山支脉武山的西麓，加快了气流沿坡上爬的速度。所以漳县上空的气流，上下翻滚，对流很旺盛，产生了雷雨云。这种云增大为雨滴向下降落时，受到其它上升气流的冲击，雨滴飞溅而分裂，发生电离作用。当电荷达到足够的强度，云块和云块之间，云块和地面之间，就会有闪电通路，并且发生放电作用。当放电的时候，因为产生了强大的高热，使局部空气容积骤然涨大，以致发生爆发现象，构成了疏疏密密的纵波，这些音波传入人们耳朵里，就是人们听到的雷声。
    冬腊月打雷的情况是少见的。可是在低层空气回暖而很不稳定的条件下，高空骤然有冷空气来到，发生对流旺盛现象，因而有雷雨云产生，放电打雷是可能的。1954年1月16日，汉口就曾经出现过。北京在1953年的冬天，也曾经打过雷。这是大自然的一种天气现象。（中央气象科学研究所　钟侃）
