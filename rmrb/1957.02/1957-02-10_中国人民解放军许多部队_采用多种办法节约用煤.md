Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are conscientiously implementing the State Council's directive on saving coal and are taking various measures to reduce coal consumption.

The logistics departments of the Public Security Forces and the garrison troops in Jinan, Wuhan, Beijing, and other places have recently formulated plans to reduce coal consumption for heating in the spring. Cadres in charge of barracks management in various units of the Public Security Forces stationed in Beijing recently discussed and formulated a plan to save coal, believing that coal consumption for heating can be universally reduced by 20% within the current standards. The Party Committee of a certain unit of the Public Security Forces stationed in Tianjin plans to save 400 tons of coal for heating this spring. The Logistics Department and the Finance Department of the Jinan Garrison recently jointly issued a notice on revising the coal consumption standards for heating this spring, stipulating that for those with a daily quota of more than five jin per person, the quota should be reduced by one jin; individual subsidies, except for salaried personnel, should be reduced by 20%. In addition to lowering the original coal consumption standard for heating by 15% to 20%, the leading organs of the Wuhan Garrison also require all units to try their best not to buy or buy less lump coal, and instead burn mixed coal or coal briquettes. A certain unit of the Jinan Garrison, without affecting office work, reduced forty-eight stoves by merging offices and connecting chimneys, saving the state more than 10,000 jin of coal in eight days.

In addition, many units have also saved a large amount of coal for the state by improving stoves and improving coal-burning techniques. The cooks of a certain unit changed the original exhaust stoves to bellows stoves, which reduced the average daily coal consumption from eleven liang per person to six liang. Comrade Du Wenying of a certain unit researched and improved the water-boiling boiler, reducing the amount of coal used to boil a boiler of water from 145 jin to 59 jin. Rao Dekuan, the cook squad leader of a certain unit, used the method of mixing bituminous coal with earth, saving the state more than 380 jin of coal every day. This method has been promoted in the canteens of this unit.

    中国人民解放军许多部队
    采用多种办法节约用煤
    新华社8日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队认真执行国务院关于节约用煤的指示，采取各种办法减少用煤量。
    公安军和济南、武汉、北京等地驻军后勤部门，最近都分别制定了减少春季烤火用煤的计划。公安军驻北京各单位营房管理工作干部不久前讨论制定了节约用煤的计划，认为暖气用煤在现行标准内可普遍节约20％。驻天津公安军某部党委，计划在今年春季节约烤火用煤四百吨。济南驻军后勤部和财务部最近联合发出了关于修正今年春季烤火用煤标准的通知，规定凡每人每日定量在五市斤以上的减少一市斤；个人补助部分除工薪制人员外，一律降低20％。武汉驻军领导机关除降低原烤火用煤标准15％到20％外，并且要求各单位尽量不买或少买块煤，改烧混煤或煤球。济南驻军某部在不妨碍办公的原则下，用合并办公室、串通烟筒等办法，减少了四十八个火炉，八天中就为国家省煤一万多斤。
    此外，许多部队还用改进炉灶和提高烧煤技术的方法，为国家节约了大量用煤。某部炊事兵们将原来的抽风灶改为风箱灶，就使原来每人每日平均烧煤十一两降为六两。某部杜文映同志研究改进了烧水锅炉，使原来一锅炉水烧煤一百四十五斤减少到五十九斤。某部炊事班长饶德宽用烟煤掺土的办法，每天为国家省煤三百八十多斤。这个办法已在这个部队各食堂推广。
