    Welcoming the New Year, Talking About the Old Days
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Sha Yin, Guo Jie, Yin Huai
    At ten o'clock on the first holiday morning of the Spring Festival, when reporters visited the home of Huang Qing, a veteran fitter at the Shanxi Machine Factory, a group of young workers were listening to Huang Qing tell them about the past when "celebrating the New Year": It was probably during the Spring Festival eighteen years ago that Huang Qing worked hard for a whole year for the boss in a private factory. Not only did he not have a holiday during the Spring Festival, but he also had to move materials overnight and even broke his foot. He said, "You've caught up with good times!" This aroused the interest of the young workers. Some said that the lives of workers are really good now, and the country takes good care of them; others said that the factory installed small loudspeakers in their dormitories overnight before the Spring Festival, so that everyone could listen to the radio during the Spring Festival. At this time, Zhou Yongxiu, a young worker, suddenly raised a question: Since life is so good, why are there a few young workers who have poor labor discipline? Don't cherish state property? This caused a debate among everyone, and finally, they unanimously agreed with Master Huang's opinion: young people have not suffered, and they don't know where the good life comes from. The young workers were moved after listening to Master Huang's words, and when they left, they asked him to help them formulate a plan for increasing production and practicing economy after the Spring Festival.
    Today, veteran workers at the Shanxi Machine Factory received more than 300 young workers at their homes to congratulate them on the Spring Festival. Shi Mao, a veteran worker in the tool workshop living in the eastern suburbs of Taiyuan City, received a group of young workers he had trained. These young workers, who had only entered the factory a year ago, are now second-grade apprentices. Master Shi had been rewarded by the factory for his achievements in training apprentices. Today, looking at the happy smiling faces of these young people, he interestingly narrated his life as an apprentice twenty-eight years ago. He said that he had worked for three years without being promoted, and the master did not give him tools to use, nor was he willing to teach him techniques. He said, "Now when you are apprentices, you have very good learning conditions, whether you are learning technology or culture. You have tools to use as soon as you enter the factory, and the technology is open, and you can ask any master." When these young workers said goodbye to Shi Mao, they left a guarantee for the old worker: they will definitely listen to the old master's words and quickly train themselves into good workers with skills.
    A group of young male and female workers came to the home of veteran blacksmith Wang Qingchang, talking and laughing. They rushed to shake hands with Master Wang to congratulate him on entering the working class for his thirty-first Spring Festival.
    Master Wang, who is modest, amiable, loves the factory like his home, is a figure well-known and admired by everyone in the factory. Today, he told the young workers why he loves the factory so much. He said, "When I was thirteen years old, I went to a warlord Yan Xishan's arsenal to learn blacksmithing. If I found a defective product during the operation, the bosses would spit on my face. Later, I was able to operate independently, but the money I earned every month was not enough to support my wife. Now my monthly salary is more than eighty yuan, and my wife and children have a good life. Comparing the old and new societies, how can I not love our own factory?" A young worker who complained that the work was heavy and the salary was low told Master Wang with shame after listening to his talk, "After listening to the road you have traveled, we, the younger generation, feel like we are a little insensitive."

    迎新话旧	  新华社记者　莎荫　郭洁　银怀
    春节第一个假日上午十点钟，当记者到山西机器厂老钳工师黄清家里访问的时候，一伙青年工人正听师黄清给他们讲“过大年”的往事：大概是在十八年前的春节，师黄清在一家私营工厂里辛辛苦苦给老板干了一年，春节不仅没有休息，还要连夜搬材料，而且砸坏了脚。他说：“你们可算赶上了好时光！”这话引起了青年工人们的兴趣。有的说现在工人的生活真好了，国家照顾得很周到；有的说春节前厂里连夜给他们宿舍里安装了小喇叭，叫大家春节听广播。这时，青年工人周永修突然提了个问题：既然生活好了，为什么有少数青年工人劳动纪律不好？不爱护国家财产？这引起了大伙的争论，最后一致同意师师傅意见：青年人没有受过苦，他们不知道好生活怎么来的。青年工人们听了师师傅讲的话以后受到了感动，临走的时候还要求他过了春节帮助他们订增产节约计划。
    今天，山西机器厂的老工人们在他们的家里分别接待了三百多个祝贺春节的青年工人。住在太原市东郊的工具车间老工人石茂，接待了一批由他培养出来的青年工人。这些一年以前才进厂的青年工人们，现在已经是二级徒工了。石师傅曾经因为培养学徒有成绩而得到工厂的奖励。今天他看着这些青年人的愉快的笑脸，有趣地叙述着二十八年以前他当学徒的生活。他说，他曾经工作了三年都没有被提过级，师傅不给工具用，也不愿把技术教给他。他说：“现在你们当学徒，不论学技术或是学文化，都有很好的学习条件，一进厂都有工具用，技术是公开的，可以随便问那一个师傅。”这些青年工人向石茂告别的时候，给这位老工人留下了一个保证：一定听老师傅的话，迅速把自己锻炼成一个有技术的好工人。
    一伙青年男女工人有说有笑地来到老锻工王庆昌家里。他们抢着同王师傅握手，祝贺他进入工人阶级队伍的第三十一个春节。
    谦虚和蔼、爱厂如家的王师傅，是全厂人人熟知、个个仰慕的人物。今天他向青年工人们叙述了他为什么那样热爱工厂。他说：“我十三岁到了阎锡山统治下的一个兵工厂学打铁，操作中一发现次品，老板们就冲着脸唾我。后来我能独立操作了，但是每月赚的钱还养不起老婆。现在我每月薪金八十多元，老婆、小孩三口人，生活得很好。把新旧社会对比一下，我怎么能不热爱我们自己的工厂呢？”一个嫌活重嫌工资少的青年工人听了他的谈话以后，惭愧地告诉王师傅说：“我们这一代青年中，听了你们走过的路，就觉得自己好像有些不知冷热了。”
