Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan - Agricultural experts, professors, and agricultural officials from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, along with invited experts and professors from East China, South China, Southwest China, and Northeast China, held the 1957 Rice Professional Conference at the Huazhong Agricultural Science Research Institute in Wuchang from January 14th to 24th to discuss the main issues in current rice research.

The conference focused on the issue of converting from indica rice to japonica rice in the central China rice region and analyzed the reasons for the reduced yield of early japonica rice "Aomori No. 5" in Hunan and Hubei provinces in 1956. In 1956, japonica rice was widely promoted in Hunan and Hubei provinces, and the yield of "Aomori No. 5" early japonica rice was generally reduced, which led to various opinions on the conversion from indica rice to japonica rice. Some people believe that the climate in the south is very different from that in the north and is only suitable for growing indica rice and not japonica rice. Experts believe that the reason for the yield reduction is that this variety came from the northeast, where the climate is very different from this region. After being moved south, the growing period was greatly shortened, the young panicle differentiated early, and the characteristics such as sharp response to environmental conditions and strict requirements for cultivation conditions were not fully understood. The regional adaptability was not determined, and the cultivation technology had not kept up. Therefore, it was promoted on a large scale rashly, resulting in yield reductions in some areas. Therefore, experts believe that the failure of promoting "Aomori No. 5" should not be regarded as a failure of converting from indica rice to japonica rice. Since japonica rice is cold-resistant, not prone to lodging, has great potential for increasing production, and is suitable for mechanized farming, it will still be the direction of development in central China in the future. According to many historical materials, in the south, in addition to the Taihu japonica rice area, there are considerable areas of japonica rice cultivation in Guangxi, Yunnan, Hainan Island, and other places south of the Yangtze River, which also shows that japonica rice can not only be cultivated in the south, but also can be cultivated very well.

In the discussion, the atmosphere was always full of the spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom." Due to the different research data and perspectives of each person, debates were展开d on the issue. When discussing the evaluation of the "Aomori No. 5" variety and whether northern japonica rice can be moved south, the experts had different arguments. Bai Sijiu, a researcher at the Huazhong Agricultural Science Research Institute, believed that "Aomori No. 5" is an early-maturing, high-yielding variety with certain prospects for promotion, based on the fact that 64.76 mu of "Aomori No. 5" in Longdian Township, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, averaged 814 jin per mu, and affirmed that this variety can be introduced from the south. Xie Guofan, deputy director of the Hunan Provincial Comprehensive Agricultural Experiment Station, disagreed with this view. He believed that "Aomori No. 5" increased production in small areas but reduced production in large areas, which was obviously not adapted to the general cultivation conditions of the local area and could not be called a promising high-quality variety. The final consensus was that although "Aomori No. 5" can achieve outstanding high yields under the conditions of high fertilization, early transplanting, and dense planting, the current situation in central China is still a lack of fertilizer, labor, and cultivation technology, and this variety is not adapted to large-scale production conditions. However, other varieties of japonica rice can be used as selection materials and are also needed, and extensive experimentation, trial planting demonstrations, and steady promotion should still be carried out.

In addition, the meeting also discussed issues such as "double-cropping early and late rice seedling raising," "collection, preservation, and utilization of local varieties," and "investigation and research on multiple cropping rotation systems."

    华中地区究竟能不能种粳稻？
    许多农业专家在武昌集会讨论这个问题
    一致认为籼稻改种粳稻仍然是发展方向
    新华社武汉讯　湖南、湖北、江西三省的农业专家、教授、农业部门的干部和应邀前来的华东、华南、西南、东北等地区的专家、教授们，1月14日到24日在武昌华中农业科学研究所举行了1957年水稻专业会议，讨论了当前水稻研究的主要问题。
    会上着重讨论了华中水稻地区籼稻改种粳稻的问题，并对早粳“青森五号”1956年在湖南、湖北两省减产的原因进行了分析。1956年在湖南、湖北两省大面积推广了粳稻，其中“青森五号”早粳普遍的减了产，因而引起各种对籼稻改种粳稻的不同看法。有的人认为南方的气候和北方相差很大，只适宜于种籼稻而不宜种粳稻。专家们认为，减产的原因是由于这一品种来自气候和本区悬殊很大的东北，南移后生育期大大缩短，幼穗分化早，加之对环境条件反应锐敏、栽培条件要求严格等特性没有充分掌握，地区适应性没有确定，栽培技术尚未跟上，而冒然地在大面积推广，因此，造成一些地区减产。因此，专家们认为，推广“青森五号”的失败，不能认为是籼稻改种粳稻的失败。由于粳稻具有耐寒、不易倒伏、增产潜力大、适宜于机耕的要求，今后仍然是华中地区发展的方向。从许多历史资料上看，在南方除太湖粳稻区外，长江以南的广西、云南、海南岛等地都有相当大面积的粳稻栽培，也说明粳稻在南方不仅可以栽培，而且能栽培得很好。
    在讨论中，始终充满着百家争鸣的气氛。由于各人所根据的研究资料和看问题的角度不同，对问题展开了论争。在讨论对“青森五号”品种估价和北粳是否可以南移的问题时，专家们存在着不同的论点。华中农业科学研究所的研究员白思九，根据湖北省孝感县龙店乡六十四点七六亩“青森五号”平均亩产八百一十四斤的事实，认为“青森五号”是一个早熟丰产、有一定推广前途的品种，并且肯定这种品种是可以南引的。湖南省综合农业试验站副站长谢国藩，不同意这个看法，他认为“青森五号”在小面积增产，在大面积却减产，显然和本地一般栽培条件不相适应，不能称它为有希望的优良品种。最后一致的意见认为“青森五号”虽然在多肥、早插、密插的条件下能获得突出的高产，但华中地区目前情况仍然是肥料不足，劳力和耕作技术缺乏，这个品种和大面积的生产条件不相适应。但是粳稻的其他品种作为选种材料是可以的，而且也是需要的，仍应广泛地进行试验和试种示范，稳步地推广。
    此外，会上还讨论了“双季早、晚稻育秧”、“地方品种征集、保存与利用”、“复种轮作制度调查研究”等问题。
