Guangdong and Henan's Health Undertakings are Developing Rapidly
The Shortage of Doctors and Medicine in Vast Rural Areas Has Been Changed

(Our Newspaper News) Guangdong Province's rural health work saw significant development last year. Throughout the province, a total of 101 new hygiene and epidemic prevention stations were built in various counties, and more than 130 new district health clinics were established. The entire province has now achieved a situation where every county has a people's hospital and a hygiene and epidemic prevention station, and more than two-thirds of the districts have district health clinics.

Various regions established more grassroots medical institutions last year. Up to the third quarter of last year, more than 1,200 new township health stations, joint clinics, and medical stations were established, some run by agricultural production cooperatives and others by joint clinics that resolved their own funding issues. The establishment of these grassroots medical institutions has greatly facilitated medical treatment for farmers.

Last year, the province also trained more than 40,000 health workers who did not leave production. They undertook health propaganda work in agricultural cooperatives throughout the region and assisted township health stations, health centers, and others in carrying out health work. Last year, many doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine organized themselves, signed medical contracts with agricultural cooperatives, and established medical stations and joint clinics in rural areas to serve the farmers.

Last year, the Guangdong Provincial Health Department also paid attention to strengthening health work in fishing areas.

Also, Henan Province currently has 707 municipal, county, and central township health centers (stations), an increase of 174.1% compared to 1955. These institutions were rebuilt on the basis of district health clinics and joint medical institutions with better foundations. There are currently 1,794 joint Chinese and Western medicine clinics, an increase of 9.6% compared to 1955. Seven joint clinics have also been established in mountainous areas such as Sihe Township in Lingbao County, where there is a shortage of doctors and medicine. The development of agricultural cooperative health rooms has been even faster, reaching 2,522, an increase of 854.9% compared to 1955. The establishment of health rooms in agricultural cooperatives in many areas has facilitated medical treatment for farmers and is beneficial to production. Maternity stations have also increased by 240.6% compared to 1955, with a current total of 3,436. Seventy percent of newborns in the county are delivered using the new method of delivery.

Many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have been appropriately arranged. There are currently 2,736 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners working in public medical institutions and 4,586 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners working in agricultural production cooperative health rooms. At present, most counties in Henan Province have almost achieved a situation where every township has a clinic, and a grassroots medical prevention network has been initially established, greatly changing the shortage of doctors and medicine in vast rural areas.

    广东、河南卫生事业发展很快
    广大农村缺医少药的情况有了改变
    本报讯　广东省农村卫生工作去年有很大的发展。去年全省各县新建的卫生防疫站总共有一百零一所，新建的区卫生所达到一百三十多个。全省现在已经做到县县有人民医院和卫生防疫站，三分之二以上的区有区卫生所。
    各地去年建立了更多的基层医疗机构。到去年第三季度为止，新建立的乡卫生站、联合诊所、医疗站等一共有一千二百多个，它们有的由农业生产合作社开办，有的由联合诊所自己解决经费问题。这些基层医疗机构的建立，大大便利农民治病。
    去年全省还训练了四万多名不脱离生产的保健员，他们在各地的农业社里担任卫生宣传工作，并且协助乡卫生站、保健站等开展保健工作。去年有许多中、西医生组织起来，分别同农业社订立医疗合同，在乡里设立医疗站、联合诊所，为农民服务。
    去年广东省卫生厅还注意加强渔业地区的卫生工作。
    又讯　河南省现有市、县中心乡卫生院（所）七百零七个，比1955年增长了174.1％。这些机构都是在区卫生所和基础较好的联合医疗机构的基础上改建的。中西医联合诊所现有一千七百九十四个，较1955年增长了9.6％。在缺医少药的灵宝县四合乡等山区，也建立了七个联合诊所。农业合作社的卫生室发展更快，已达二千五百二十二个，比1955年增长了854.9％。不少地区的农业合作社的卫生室的建立，便利农民治病，有利生产。接生站也比1955年增长了240.6％，现有三千四百三十六个。全县70％的新生婴儿采用了新法接生。
    许多中医得到了适当的安排。现在在公立医疗机构中工作的中医有二千七百三十六名，在农业生产合作社卫生室工作的中医有四千五百八十六名。现在河南省大部分县几乎达到了乡乡有诊所，初步建立起基层医疗预防网，大大改变了广大农村缺医少药的情况。
