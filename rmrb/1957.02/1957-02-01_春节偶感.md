    Spring Festival Thoughts	Wu Lü

    Last Spring Festival, I spent it in Shenyang. At that time, many factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and trade union chairmen in Shenyang visited workers' families before or during the festival. Some news reports were also published, saying that the harvest was great. Leading cadres understood the situation, the masses of workers raised their awareness, and so on. I still remember that Shenyang Daily had a piece of news saying: Some workers were so moved to tears when leading cadres came to visit, and some workers even wrote letters to their superiors afterwards to express their gratitude.

    These, of course, are good things. However, upon closer reflection, leading cadres making a trip to workers' homes causes some workers to burst into tears on the spot, and afterwards, some workers write letters of gratitude. This, besides illustrating that it is a "good thing," probably also illustrates that it is a rare thing. If they visited more often, why would it be like this? Moreover, is it just that they rarely visit workers' homes; in some enterprises, do leading cadres even rarely go to the workshops?

    Leaving aside other things, just speaking of being alive, everyone needs to have some friends, and factory leading cadres are naturally no exception. But, how many factory leading cadres have truly made friends with the workers? I have been to many factories, and such leading cadres are not nonexistent, but they are indeed not too many. Going to a worker's home for a visit yields a "great harvest," so why not make friends with the workers and visit them often? Wouldn't visiting often yield an even greater harvest?

    Now, it's Spring Festival again, and inevitably, some factory leading cadres will visit workers' families. Usually, they are not free, but taking a trip during the festival is good, no matter what. However, I also offer a little hope, which is that it would be best to visit workers' homes often even after the festival.

    春节偶感	吴滤
    去年春节，我是在沈阳过的。当时，沈阳市许多工厂的厂长、党委书记、工会主席都曾经在节前或节中访问过工人家庭。报上也登过一些新闻，说是收获很大。领导干部了解了下情，职工群众提高了觉悟等等。至今还记得，沈阳日报有一条新闻中说：有些工人见领导干部来访问，感动得流下泪来，有些工人事后还向领导上写信表示感谢。
    这些，当然是好事。可是，细想起来，领导干部到工人家里走一趟，当场就有工人感动得流下泪来，事后又有工人写感谢信，这除了说明是“好事”而外，大概也说明这是稀有的事。若是走得勤些，何至如此呢？而且岂仅是很少到工人家里去走走，在有些企业里，不是领导干部连车间都很少去吗？
    姑且不说其他，只谈人生在世，都要有些朋友，工厂的领导干部自然也难例外。可是，有多少工厂的领导干部，是真正同工人交了朋友的呢？我到过很多工厂，这样的领导干部不是没有，但确实不太多。到工人家里走一趟，“收获很大”，那么，为什么不同工人交交朋友，常去走动走动呢？常去走走，不是收获更大吗？
    现在，又是春节了，少不了又有些工厂的领导干部会去访问工人家庭。平常没有空，节日里走一趟，不管怎么说，都是好的。不过，也提一点希望，这就是节后最好也常到工人家里走走。
