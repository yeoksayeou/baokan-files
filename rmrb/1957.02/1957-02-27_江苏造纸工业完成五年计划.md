    江苏造纸工业完成五年计划
    新华社南京26日电　江苏省机器造纸工业提前完成了第一个五年计划，纸张产量完成五年计划的101％；现在的纸张产量比1952年增长一倍以上。
    四年来，各纸厂职工努力提高技术、改进管理，充分发挥现有设备的潜力。去年厂际竞赛中所推广的加快抄速等先进经验，对各厂的技术改造起了很大推动作用，使纸张产量成倍地提高。在产品质量方面，四年来也有很大改进。华盛造纸厂的黄版纸去年在全国黄版纸交流会上被评为第二名；利用造纸厂的新闻纸质量，也一直稳定在较高的水平上。各厂在节约原材料、降低成本等方面，也取得很大的成绩。利用造纸厂去年新闻纸的成本比1952年降低三分之二。
    目前各厂正在开展增产节约运动，争取在今年增产更多的纸张。
