Comrade Representatives!

First of all, I want to congratulate you, and through you, the 500 million hard-working farmers. Congratulations to everyone for the victories achieved on the road of agricultural collectivization in accordance with the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao. I hope that the representatives present can work with all the farmers to work hard in production and cooperative construction, and support the country's socialist industrialization on the basis of developing agricultural production and running cooperatives well.

Now I would like to talk to you about the achievements of our country's economic work last year and this year's economic construction work, and also talk about some things about strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and developing worker-peasant friendship.

I. Achievements of Last Year and Work This Year

1956 was a year of decisive victory for China's transition to socialism and a year of comprehensive economic upsurge. More than 96% of farm households across the country have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives; more than 90% of handicraftsmen have been organized; capitalist industrial enterprises accounting for 99% of output value and 98% of the number of employees have realized joint state-private ownership, and capitalist commercial enterprises and small businesses have also basically realized joint state-private ownership and cooperativization across the industry. In this way, the exploitation system that has ruled the Chinese people for thousands of years has been basically eradicated from the land of China, creating the most favorable conditions for our country's economic development.

In 1956, industrial production, due to the bumper harvest in agriculture in 1955, the supply of raw materials needed by light industry was relatively sufficient. At the same time, the upsurge of agricultural collectivization and socialist construction also greatly increased the demand for heavy industrial products. Therefore, both light and heavy industries have developed greatly. The total output value is expected to complete 106.6% of the plan, reaching the 1957 level stipulated in the plan one year ahead of schedule, with a growth rate of 27.7%. Of the 46 major products listed in the Five-Year Plan, 26 have reached the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. In terms of agricultural production, in 1956, driven by the high tide of collectivization, the enthusiasm of farmers for production was unprecedentedly high, and they overcame extremely serious agricultural disasters, so that the output of grain and other crops (except cotton) in the country in 1956 was still higher than the bumper 1955. In 1956, the task of capital construction was very heavy, an increase of 59.8% over 1955. It was the year with the largest investment amount and the fastest growth since 1953. It is estimated that the cumulative investment in capital construction from 1953 to 1956 will complete about 80.8% of the total investment in the Five-Year Plan. Most of the key projects stipulated in the Five-Year Plan are likely to be completed ahead of schedule or overfulfilled.

Labor productivity has also increased greatly under the impetus of the rising socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. On the basis of production development and increased labor productivity, people's lives have also improved significantly in 1956. The average wage of employees increased by about 13% compared with 1955, an increase of 33.5% compared with 1952, which also exceeded the target set by the Five-Year Plan that could only be achieved in 1957.

In line with the development of the above-mentioned production and construction and the improvement of people's lives, there has also been great development in culture, education, science, and health and sanitation in 1956.

Comrade Representatives, the achievements of 1956 were great, but while making great achievements, there were also some errors and shortcomings in the formulation and implementation of the 1956 plan, which caused some tension in the economic life of 1956. However, on the whole, the shortcomings and errors are secondary, and the achievements are primary. The most important lesson in the practice of economic life in 1956 is that the Party and the state must correctly handle the relationship between rationally arranging national construction and improving people's lives. When arranging the speed of construction and development, we must pay attention to the possibility of the growth of means of production and the possibility of the growth of accumulation funds; when arranging plans for improving people's lives, we must pay attention to the level of growth of consumer goods and consumer funds. In other words, our country's construction and the improvement of people's lives cannot be separated from our country's current economic level. For our cooperatives, this means how much should be turned over to the state as accumulation for socialist industrialization, how much should be retained in the cooperative to expand production, and how much should be distributed to members to improve their lives; for members, this means how much to spend and how much to save. Every farmer, especially cooperative cadres, must take good care of this issue. It is not easy to run a cooperative and manage a family well. We must always save, and not use everything up.

The task of economic construction in 1957 is to continue to promote the socialist cause forward on the basis of the great victory in 1956, and gradually eliminate some of the imbalances brought about in 1956 in the process of development, successfully complete the first Five-Year Plan, and create favorable conditions for the implementation of the second Five-Year Plan. To this end:

First, actively increase production. In industry, except for a very few products that are limited by raw materials, such as yarn and cloth, and products that are limited by sales, such as cigarettes, we must strive to increase production; even for products such as yarn and cloth, which are limited by raw materials, we must strive to overfulfill the plan on the premise of saving raw materials. The total industrial output value in 1957 is expected to increase by 6.2% compared with 1956 (of which the means of production will increase by 8.8% and the means of consumption will increase by 3.6%). All industrial departments must make full use of all available resources according to different circumstances, save raw materials, tap the potential of enterprise equipment, improve product quality, increase varieties, and increase output to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of planned tasks. In terms of agricultural production, it is necessary to increase the production of grain, cotton, oil crops, and live pigs as much as possible to meet the needs of people's lives and exports. In 1957, agricultural and rural sideline production is expected to increase by about 7% compared with 1956, exceeding the 4% target set by the Five-Year Plan. The total grain output will increase by about 6%, and the cotton output will increase by about 13%, both exceeding the targets set by the Five-Year Plan. In addition to continuing to increase the production of grain and cotton, it is also necessary to increase the production of other cash crops, develop animal husbandry, forestry, and fishery, and various other sideline productions. In order to promote the development of agricultural production, the plan stipulates that the irrigated area will continue to be expanded, and the supply of chemical fertilizers will be expanded under the guidance of household manure accumulation. Under the current conditions in our country, the bumper and poor harvests of agricultural production have a significant impact on the development of the entire national economy, because agricultural production is a basic condition for improving people's lives, provides raw materials and markets for light industry, is an important market for many heavy industrial products, is an important source of national capital accumulation, and is an important source of export materials. Therefore, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's agricultural production plan is of great significance to the economic development of this year and next year.

In addition to industrial and agricultural production, other economic sectors such as transportation must increase production.

Second, ensure key construction and appropriately concentrate the use of funds. The capital construction in 1957 must be based on the possibility of the state's financial and material resources, and the plan must be placed on a fully reliable basis. The scale of construction must be balanced with the four aspects of means of production, means of living, finance, and foreign exchange. When arranging investment projects, we must concentrate the use appropriately, complete the key projects stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan as much as possible, and strive to connect with the tasks stipulated in the second Five-Year Plan. Other facilities that are essential for serving production, such as housing and urban public utilities, should also be properly taken care of so that the key projects can obtain the necessary conditions for normal production after completion. The cumulative investment in capital construction from 1953 to 1957 will still exceed 14% of the total investment stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. There are a total of 694 factory and mine construction units above the quota stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, and it is expected that more than 800 can be achieved.

Third, practice strict economy and promote the style of hard work and plain living. In 1957, all production departments and economic departments must further improve labor productivity, reduce production costs, and save management expenses. All agencies, groups, schools, and enterprises must conscientiously streamline institutions, streamline personnel, save administrative expenses, and improve work efficiency. Oppose extravagance and waste, promote the style of hard work and plain living, and implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and frugally, running cooperatives diligently and frugally, and building the country diligently and frugally. In society, we must also promote the virtues of diligence and thrift of our people and advocate a spirit of diligence and frugality. We must never take a one-sided financial or technical point of view to treat the issue of practicing strict economy, nor can we regard saving as a means to solve some temporary difficulties. We must know that practicing strict economy is the basic way to build socialism and an effective method for the state power led by the working class and various economic organizations to resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology. The movement to practice strict economy is actually a form of the great rectification movement against bureaucracy and subjectivism. We should implement the spirit of the rectification movement through the saving movement.

Fourth, appropriately improve the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of increasing production.

Without major natural disasters, it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the various targets set by the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in 1957.

To ensure the realization of the above measures, the most important condition is to rely on the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses. The Eighth National Congress of the Party has formulated various policies and guidelines for our country's economic construction, enabling our country's economic construction to move forward along a correct path. Encouraged by the great achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the socialist enthusiasm of the people across the country is constantly rising, which is an important guarantee for overfulfilling the 1957 plan.

II. Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance and Develop Worker-Peasant Friendship

Constantly consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and developing worker-peasant friendship is a fundamental guarantee for building socialism. The victory of our country's democratic revolution and socialist revolution is inseparable from the continuous consolidation and development of the worker-peasant alliance led by our country's working class; similarly, the victory of our country's socialist construction needs further consolidation and development of the worker-peasant alliance. Because workers and peasants are not only the most reliable allies who share weal and woe and depend on each other in the revolutionary struggle, but also brothers who are as close as flesh and blood and will never be separated in the socialist construction cause. If industry is separated from agriculture, there will be no raw materials for agricultural crops and no vast rural market; similarly, if agriculture is separated from industry, it will be impossible to carry out technological transformation and there will be no further development of productive forces. If agricultural productivity cannot be greatly improved, it will be impossible to improve the lives of farmers. Therefore, agriculture must rely on the support of industry, and similarly, industry must rely on the help of agriculture. This mutual support and help between industry and agriculture, the close alliance between workers and peasants, and the correct combination of industry and agriculture are the basic guarantees for building socialism.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the lives of workers and peasants have become increasingly stable and improved year by year compared with before liberation. This is one of the basic manifestations of the superiority of the socialist system. However, not everyone actually sees this clearly. For example, some people think that the lives of workers and peasants are too different today, the lives of farmers are very hard, the lives of workers are much higher than the lives of farmers, and there is a world of difference between the lives of workers and peasants.

This view is wrong. People who say this are at least lacking a comprehensive investigation of the labor and living conditions of workers and peasants in the past and present.

In order to help everyone understand this issue, we will first compare the consumption levels of workers and peasants in 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War with the consumption levels in 1952, 1955, and 1956 since liberation. According to a survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the average consumption of farmers per capita in the country in 1936 was 61.2 yuan (including both self-sufficient consumption and commodity consumption of farmers, both calculated at constant prices in 1952, same below). The average consumption of employees per capita in the country was 130 yuan, and the consumption of employees was 2.12 times that of farmers. After liberation, in 1952, at the end of the economic recovery period, according to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, the average consumption of farmers per capita was 72 yuan, the average consumption of employees per capita was 151 yuan, and the consumption of employees was 2.097 times that of farmers; in 1955, the average consumption of farmers per capita was 78.9 yuan, the average consumption of employees per capita was 164.6 yuan, and the consumption of employees was 2.086 times that of farmers; in 1956, the average consumption of farmers per capita was 81 yuan, the average consumption of employees per capita was 179.6 yuan, and the consumption of employees was 2.217 times that of farmers. Of course, the numbers of average consumption of farmers per capita in the country listed here still have some differences in different regions and between wealthy and relatively poor farmers. However, through these numbers, we can see the general situation of the comparison of the lives of workers and peasants in our country since liberation.

What can be seen from the above materials?

First, this material shows that the consumption levels of both employees and farmers have greatly improved compared with before the Anti-Japanese War. The consumption level of employees in our country in 1956 was about 38% higher than in 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War, and about 19% higher than in the last year of the recovery period (1952); during the same period, the consumption level of farmers was about 32.3% higher than in 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War, and about 12.5% higher than in 1952. This fact eloquently illustrates the specific situation of the improvement of farmers' lives since liberation. It can be seen that the view that the Party and the government only paid attention to improving the lives of workers after liberation and did not pay serious attention to improving the lives of farmers is not consistent with the facts and is incorrect.

Second, this material also shows that the speed of improving the consumption levels of employees and farmers is relatively close. If calculated from 1952 to 1956, the average annual increase in the consumption level of farmers is 3%, and the average annual increase in the consumption level of employees is 4.4%. If calculated from 1952 to 1955 for four years, the former increased at a speed of 3.1%, and the latter increased at a speed of 2.9%. The reason for the difference between the two calculation methods is mainly because a wage reform was carried out among employees in 1956, and the wages of employees increased by about 13% compared with the previous year. In the same year, due to the severe disaster situation and poor agricultural harvest, the income of farmers did not increase much. This is a temporary phenomenon. It can be seen that the view that the lives of workers have improved too quickly and the lives of farmers have improved too slowly is also inconsistent with the facts and is incorrect.

Third, this material of course also shows that the consumption levels of employees and farmers calculated in currency (not referring to material objects) still have certain differences today. This is because the working class is engaged in modern production, and their labor productivity is much higher than that of farmers; moreover, the production and consumption of farmers in our country still have a large self-sufficient economic nature (the self-sufficient consumption of farmers currently accounts for about 60% of their total consumption), while in the consumption of employees, almost all of them belong to commodity consumption. Moreover, this difference in consumption levels between employees and farmers is not greater now than before the Anti-Japanese War. It can be seen that the view that the lives of employees and farmers are increasingly disparate or too disparate is also inconsistent with the facts and is incorrect.

Under the leadership of the working class, farmers in our country have been politically liberated and have greatly improved their economic lives. This is by no means accidental. This is inseparable from the consistent concern and assistance of the working class party - the Communist Party of China - and the people's democratic power led by the working class for our farmer brothers. The Party and the government once led the farmers in the great revolutionary war, land reform, and agricultural socialist cooperativization. In this way, the farmers were guided to the great socialist road. At the same time, the Party and the government also gave farmers a series of assistance. For example, in terms of burden, before the Anti-Japanese War, the entire farmers had to give more than 37% of their net income, and the poor and hired farmers even had to give about 70% of their net income to landlords, usurers, and power organs. Now farmers only give about 7% of their net income to their own power to seek welfare for themselves. In terms of rent alone, in the land reform, 300 million farmers who had no land or little land obtained 700 million mu of land and were exempted from the burden of paying 60 billion jin of grain to landlords every year. In terms of the price difference between industrial and agricultural products, it narrowed by 17.2% in 1955 compared with 1950. In 1955 alone, farmers earned about 2 billion yuan more as a result. In terms of the government's material assistance to farmers, from 1950 to 1956, the state invested about 2.6 billion yuan in basic water conservancy construction, about 1.31 billion yuan in disaster relief and relief funds, and about 1.27 billion yuan in funds for promoting improved varieties, new agricultural tools, and improving agricultural production technology. The above three items totaled about 5.18 billion yuan, equivalent to about 32% of the taxes paid by farmers to the state in seven years. In addition, the state has cumulatively lent farmers more than 8 billion yuan in low-interest loans in seven years to support farmers. No ruling class and no system in history has brought so many benefits to farmers.

If so, why do some people think that the current consumption level of farmers is lower than before the Anti-Japanese War? The reason why they say this is that they confuse the consumption level of landlords and rich peasants before the Anti-Japanese War with the consumption level of ordinary farmers. According to 1936, the average consumption level of landlords and rich peasants per capita was 327.6 yuan, while the average consumption level of ordinary farmers was only 61.2 yuan, a difference of more than five times. That is to say, the average consumption level of one landlord and rich peasant is equal to the consumption level of the entire "five-member family" of farmers. Of course, this is still calculated by averaging the consumption levels of middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired farmers. If the consumption levels of the vast majority of poor peasants and hired farmers are calculated separately, the difference in consumption levels between landlords, rich peasants, and poor peasants will be even greater. May I ask, how can this statement represent the consumption level of farmers? Obviously, this statement is not the opinion of ordinary farmers, but only the "things are not what they used to be" sentiment of those landlords and rich peasants whose consumption level has really decreased compared with before the Anti-Japanese War, and the complaints of a small number of wealthy middle peasants who temporarily reduced their income after joining the cooperative.

Of course, due to the result of the long-term evil rule of imperialism and domestic reactionary classes colluding with each other in the past, our country's economy is very backward. Since liberation, through the efforts of the Party and the people of the country, this backward situation has begun to change. However, compared with some other advanced countries, the consumption level of workers or farmers in our country today is still very low. Because of this, we concentrate our main efforts on socialist construction, thereby developing production, prospering the economy, in order to further improve the consumption level of our people. We know that the improvement of the lives of the people in our country is ultimately determined by the level of development of industry and agriculture in our country. To improve the level of production in our industry and agriculture, we can only constantly consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and develop worker-peasant friendship, so that workers and farmers are united, work together with one heart, support each other, and work together to achieve it.

Consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance is the common interest of workers and farmers in our country, and it is also the common interest of socialism. Therefore, we must strengthen the education of the worker-peasant alliance from both sides, eliminate any misunderstandings between workers and farmers, fully support all words and deeds that are conducive to worker-peasant unity, and give appropriate education and criticism to all words and deeds that are harmful to worker-peasant unity. Only in this way can the worker-peasant alliance be further consolidated and developed on a new basis. May the worker-peasant alliance in our country last forever, and may the worker-peasant friendship be as high as the mountains and as deep as the water! (Xinhua News Agency)

    巩固工农联盟　发展工农友谊
    薄一波副总理在全国农业劳动模范代表会议上的报告（摘要）各位代表同志们！
    首先我要向你们，并通过你们向五万万勤劳的农民祝贺。祝贺大家遵照党和毛主席的指示在农业合作化道路上所取得的胜利，希望到会的代表能和全体农民一道，努力生产，努力进行合作社的建设，在发展农业生产，办好合作社的基础上支援国家的社会主义工业化。
    现在我想同大家说一说我国去年经济工作的成就和今年经济建设工作，并且谈一谈加强工农联盟和发展工农友谊的一些事情。
    一、去年的成就和今年的工作
    1956年是我国向社会主义过渡取得决定性胜利的一年，是国民经济全面高涨的一年。全国已有96％以上的农户加入了农业生产合作社；90％以上的手工业者已组织起来；占产值99％和占职工人数98％的资本主义工业企业已实现了公私合营，资本主义商业企业和小商业也已基本上实现了全行业公私合营和合作化。这样，统治了中国人民几千年的剥削制度，就基本上从中国土地上被根除，使我国经济发展获得了最有利的条件。
    1956年的工业生产，由于1955年农业丰收，轻工业所需要的原料供应比较充足，同时农业合作化和社会主义建设高潮对重工业品需要也大量增长，所以，轻重工业都有很大发展。总产值预计可以完成计划的106.6％，提前一年达到计划规定的1957年水平，增长速度为27.7％。五年计划所列的四十六种主要产品已有二十六种提前一年达到五年计划。农业生产方面，1956年由于合作化高潮的推动，农民生产积极性空前高涨，战胜了极大的农业灾害，使1956年全国粮食和其他农作物（除棉花外）的产量比丰收的1955年还有所增加。1956年基本建设任务很大，比1955年增长了59.8％，是1953年以来投资额最多和增长得最快的一年，预计1953—1956年基本建设投资额累计完成五年计划投资总额的80.8％左右。五年计划规定的重点工程绝大部分有可能提前完成或超额完成。
    劳动生产率在广大人民高涨的社会主义积极性推动下也有很大提高。在生产发展和劳动生产率提高的基础上，人民生活在1956年也有显著的改善。职工平均工资比1955年提高13％左右，比1952年提高了33.5％，也超过了五年计划规定1957年才能达到的指标。
    同上述生产建设的发展和人民生活的改善相适应，1956年在文化、教育、科学和保健卫生等事业方面也有很大发展。
    代表同志们，1956年的成绩是巨大的，但在取得巨大成绩的同时，1956年计划的订制和执行中，也还存在着一些错误和缺点，造成了1956年经济生活中的某些紧张情况。但是，总的来看缺点和错误是次要的，成绩则是主要的。1956年经济生活实践中最主要的教训是：党和国家要正确地处理合理安排国家建设和改善人民生活的关系，在安排建设发展速度时，必须要注意到生产资料增长的可能性和积累基金增长的可能性；在安排人民生活的改善的计划时，必须要注意到消费资料增长的和消费基金增长的水平。也就是说我国的建设和人民生活的改善，都不能脱离我国当前的经济水平。这个问题对于我们合作社来说，就是拿多少上缴国家作为社会主义工业化的积累，留多少在合作社扩大生产，以多少分给社员改善生活；对社员来说，就是花费多少，积蓄多少。这个问题每个农民，特别是合作社干部都要很好的操心，办社和治家一样，要治理的好是不容易的。总要积蓄，不要全用掉。
    1957年经济建设的任务，是在1956年的伟大胜利的基础上继续推动社会主义事业向前发展，并且在发展过程中逐步消除1956年带来的某些比例失调的现象，圆满地完成第一个五年计划并为执行第二个五年计划创造有利条件。为此：
    第一，积极增加生产。在工业方面，除了极少数因原料有限制的产品如纱布、销路有限制的产品如卷烟外，都要努力增产；即使像纱布等原料有限制的产品，也要在节约原料的前提之下，力争超额完成计划。1957年工业总产值预计比1956年增长6.2％（其中生产资料增长8.8％，消费资料增长3.6％）。各个工业部门必须根据不同情况充分利用一切可以利用的资源，节约原材料，发挥企业设备潜力，提高产品质量，增多品种，增加产量，以保证计划任务的完成和超额完成。在农业生产方面，必须尽可能地增产粮食、棉花、油料作物和生猪来满足人民生活和出口需要。1957年农业及农村副业生产，预计比1956年增长7％左右，超过五年计划规定指标的4％。粮食总产量增长6％左右，棉花产量增长13％左右，都超过五年计划规定的指标。除了继续增产粮食棉花而外，还要增产其它经济作物，发展畜牧业、林业、渔业，和其它各种副业生产。为促进农业生产的发展，计划规定继续扩大灌溉面积，在农家积肥为主的方针下，扩大化学肥料的供应。在我国目前条件下，农业生产的丰、歉，对于整个国民经济的发展有重大的影响，因为农业生产是改善人民生活的基本条件，是为轻工业提供原料和市场，是许多重工业产品的重要市场，是国家资金积累的重要来源，和重要出口物资的来源。所以争取完成并超额完成今年农业生产计划对今年和明年经济发展是有重大意义的。
    除工农业生产外，交通运输等其它经济部门都要增加生产。
    第二，保证重点建设，适当地集中使用资金。1957年的基本建设必须根据国家财力和物力的可能，把计划放在充分可靠的基础上，建设的规模，必须和生产资料、生活资料、财政及外汇四个方面取得平衡。在安排投资项目时，必须适当地集中使用，尽可能地完成第一个五年计划所规定的重点项目，并争取同第二个五年计划所规定的任务相衔接。服务于生产所必不可少的其它设施如住宅、城市公用事业的建设，亦应适当照顾，使重点项目建成后得到进行正常生产所必要的条件。1953年—1957年基本建设投资额累计仍将超过五年计划规定投资总额的14％，五年计划规定施工的限额以上的厂矿建设单位共六百九十四个，预计可以达到八百多个。
    第三，厉行节约，提倡艰苦朴素作风。1957年在一切生产部门和经济部门都必须进一步提高劳动生产率，降低生产成本，节约管理费用。一切机关，团体，学校和企业，都必须切实地精简机构精简人员，节省行政费用提高工作效率。反对铺张浪费，提倡艰苦朴素的作风，贯彻勤俭办企业，勤俭办合作社，勤俭建国的方针。在社会上也要发扬我国人民勤劳俭朴的美德，提倡克勤克俭的风气。决不能采取片面的财政观点或者技术观点来看待厉行节约问题，也不能把节约看做是为了解决某些临时性的困难，要知道，厉行节约是建设社会主义的基本道路，是工人阶级所领导的国家政权和各种经济组织抵抗资产阶级思想侵蚀的一种有效方法。厉行节约的运动，实际上也就是反官僚主义、反主观主义的伟大的整风运动的一种形式，我们应当通过节约运动来贯彻整风运动的精神。
    第四，在增加生产的基础上，适当地提高人民物质文化生活水平。
    1957年度国民经济发展，如果没有特大的自然灾害，完成和超额完成第一个五年计划规定的各项指标是完全有可能的。
    要保证上述措施的实现，最重要的条件就是要依靠党的领导和群众的支持。党的第八次代表大会已为我国的经济建设制定了各项政策方针，使我国的经济建设能够沿着一条正确的道路前进。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设伟大成就的鼓舞下，全国人民社会主义积极性正在不断高涨，这是超额完成1957年计划的重要保证。
    二、巩固工农联盟，发展工农友谊
    不断地巩固工农联盟和发展工农友谊，是建设社会主义的基本保证。我国民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，是同我国工人阶级所领导的工农联盟的不断巩固和发展分不开的；同样地，我国社会主义建设的胜利，更需要工农联盟进一步地巩固和发展。因为工人和农民不仅在革命斗争中是患难与共，相依为命的最可靠的同盟者，而且在社会主义建设事业中也是永不分离的亲如手足的兄弟。工业如果离开了农业，就没有农作物原料，没有广大的农村市场；同样，农业如果离开了工业，就不可能进行技术改造，就不可能有生产力的进一步发展。如果农业生产力不能大大提高，农民生活的改善，将是不可能的。所以，农业必须依靠工业的支援，同样，工业也必须依靠农业的帮助。这种工农业的相互支援和帮助，工人和农民的亲密联盟，工业和农业的正确结合，是建设社会主义的基本保证。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以来，工农生活都比解放前日益稳定，并且逐年有所提高，这是社会主义制度优越性的基本表现之一。但是，这一些并不是所有的人都在实际上看得清楚的。例如，有的人认为：今天工人和农民的生活相差太大了，农民生活很苦，工人比农民的生活高得太多，工农生活有天渊之别等等。
    这种认为是不对的。说这种话的人，至少是由于对工人和农民过去和现在的劳动及生活状况，缺乏全面的考察。
    为了帮助大家了解这个问题，我们先把工人和农民在抗日战争前1936年的消费水平，和解放以来的1952，1955，1956年的消费水平作一对比。根据中国科学院的调查，1936年全国农民每人的平均消费额是六十一点二元（包括农民自给性的消费和商品消费两部分，都按1952年不变价格计算，下同），全国职工每人的平均消费额是一百三十元，职工的消费额为农民的消费额二点一二倍。解放后，到经济恢复时期结束的1952年，根据国家统计局的统计，农民每人的平均消费额七十二元，职工每人的平均消费额一百五十一元，职工的消费额为农民的消费额二点零九七倍；1955年农民每人平均消费额七八点九元，职工每人平均消费额一六四点六元，职工的消费额为农民的消费额二点零八六倍；1956年农民每人平均的消费额八十一元，职工每人的消费额一七九点六元，职工的消费额为农民的消费额二点二一七倍。当然，这里所列举的全国农民平均消费额的数字，在不同地区，在富裕的和比较穷困的农民之间，还是有所差别的，但是，透过这些数字，是可以看出解放以来我国工农生活对比的一般情况的。
    从上面的材料中可以看出什么问题呢？
    第一，这个材料说明，职工和农民的消费水平，都比抗战以前有了很大的提高。我国职工的消费水平，1956年比抗日战争前的1936年大约提高38％，比恢复时期的最后一年（1952年）大约提高19％；同一时期，农民的消费水平比抗日战争前的1936年大约提高32.3％，比1952年大约提高12.5％。这一事实雄辩地说明了解放以来农民生活改善的具体情况。可见，那种认为解放后党和政府只注意了改善工人的生活，而对农民生活的改善没有认真注意的观点，是不合事实的和不正确的。
    第二，这个材料还说明：职工和农民消费水平提高的速度是比较接近的，如果以1952年—1956年计算，农民的消费水平每年平均提高的速度是3％，职工的消费水平每年平均提高的速度是4.4％，如果以1952年—1955年四年计算，则前者提高的速度是3.1％，后者提高的速度是2.9％。两种计算方法之所以发生差别，主要是因为1956年在职工中进行了工资改革，职工的工资较上年大约提高13％，而在同年，由于灾情较重农业歉收，农民收入增加不多所致。这是一种暂时现象。可见，那种认为工人生活改善过快，农民生活改善过慢的观点，也是不合事实的和不正确的。
    第三，这个材料当然也说明了今天职工和农民按货币（不是指实物）计算的消费水平还有一定的差别。这是由于工人阶级从事现代化的生产，他们的劳动生产率也较农民高得多；并且，由于我国农民的生产和消费，目前还带有很大的自给经济的性质（目前农民自给性的消费仍占其全部消费额的60％左右），而在职工的消费额中，则几乎全部都属于商品性的消费。而且，职工和农民消费水平的这种差别，现在比抗日战争以前并未扩大。可见那种认为职工和农民的生活日益悬殊或者悬殊过大的观点，同样也是不合事实的和不正确的。
    我国农民在工人阶级的领导之下，在政治上得到了解放，在经济生活上获得了很大的改善，这决不是偶然的。这是和工人阶级的政党——中国共产党以及工人阶级所领导的人民民主政权，对于农民兄弟的一贯关怀和援助分不开的。党和政府曾经领导农民进行了伟大的革命战争、土地改革和农业社会主义合作化。这样，就把农民引导到伟大的社会主义道路上来。与此同时，党和政府还给了农民一系列的援助。例如，在负担方面，抗日战争以前，就全体农民来说要把自己净收入的37％以上，就贫农和雇农来看，甚至要把自己净收入的70％左右，交给地主高利贷者及政权机关。而现在农民只把自己净收入的7％左右交给他们自己的政权，来为自己谋福利。仅就地租一项来说，在土地改革中三亿无地少地的农民就获得了七亿亩土地，免除了每年向地主交纳租粮六百亿斤的负担。在工农产品差价方面，1955年比1950年缩小了17.2％。仅以1955年一年计算，农民即因此多收入二十亿元左右。在人民政府对于农民的物质帮助方面，从1950年到1956年的七年中，国家投入水利基本建设的经费约有二十六亿多元，发放救灾和救济的经费约有十三点一亿元，用于推广优良品种、新式农具、提高农业生产技术等经费约有十二点七亿元，以上三项共计约有五十一点八亿元，相当于农民在七年中向国家缴纳税款的32％左右。此外，国家在七年中还累计贷给了农民八十多亿元的低利贷款，来扶助农民。历史上没有那一个统治阶级那一种制度为农民带来过这么多的利益。
    既然如此，为什么还有一些人认为现在农民的消费水平比抗日战争以前还低了呢？他们所以这样说，是把抗日战争前地主富农的消费水平和一般农民的消费水平混同起来了。按1936年来说，地主和富农每人的平均消费水平是三百二十七元六角，而一般农民的平均消费水平只有六十一元二角，两者相差五倍之多，也就是说，地主富农一个人的平均消费水平就等于农民“五口之家”全家的消费水平，自然，这还是把中农、贫农和雇农的消费水平平均在一起计算的，如果把占农民绝大多数的贫农和雇农分开计算，地主、富农和贫农消费水平的差别，还要更大。试问，这种说法又如何能代表农民的消费水平呢？显然，这种说法，并不是一般农民的意见，而只是那些真正比抗日战争前降低了消费水平的地主富农所发出的“今非昔比”的感慨，和一小部分参加合作社以后暂时减少了收入的富裕中农的怨言而已。
    自然，由于过去帝国主义和国内反动阶级相勾结，进行长期的罪恶统治的结果，使我国经济十分落后，解放以来，经过党和全国人民的努力，这种落后状况在开始改变，但是，如果和其他一些先进国家相比，我国工人或者农民今天的消费水平都还是很低的。正因为这样，我们才集中主要力量进行社会主义建设，从而发展生产，繁荣经济，以便进一步提高我国人民的消费水平。我们知道我国人民生活的改善，归根结底是由于我国工业和农业的发展水平所决定的，而要提高我国工业和农业的生产水平，只有不断地巩固工农联盟和发展工农友谊，使工人和农民团结无间同心协力，共同劳动，相互支援，才能达到。
    巩固和发展工农联盟是我国工人和农民共同的利益，也是社会主义的共同利益，因此必须从两方面来加强工农联盟的教育，消除工人和农民之间的任何误解，一切有利于工农团结的言行，都要全力支持；一切有害于工农团结的言行，都要给以适当的教育和批评。只有这样，才能使工农联盟在新的基础上更加巩固和发展起来，愿我国的工农联盟天长地久，工农友谊山高水深！　　　（新华社）
