Entering the Jiang’an Sanatorium for Railway Workers in China, one immediately feels a sense of cleanliness and comfort. In the two small courtyards in front of and behind the sanatorium building, trees are neatly arranged in rows, and rows of Chinese holly are trimmed meticulously, with various potted flowers arranged in layers on the flower beds. Newcomers often assume that these courtyards are maintained and cleaned by dedicated personnel. In fact, all of this is done by the entire sanatorium staff, led by the 71-year-old director, Zhang Shihhan, who spare time to sweep and clean. The trimming, watering, and cultivation of trees and flowers are all undertaken by the old director alone.

Communist Party member Zhang Shihhan is a well-known old “February 7th” worker in Wuhan. He has been the director of the Jiang’an Sanatorium since its opening in 1951. According to the staffing plan, this sanatorium should have nineteen employees. However, at the beginning, there were only twelve employees, and there was no one to wash the bedding used by the patients. Zhang Shihhan took off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and started washing himself. Influenced by him, all the staff, including the doctors, spared time to wash sheets, quilts, and pillowcases for the patients, overcoming the difficulty of having too few people. After 1952, the sanatorium staff had a maximum of sixteen people and a minimum of only eleven people, but Zhang Shihhan never complained to his superiors. He always discussed with everyone how to rationally arrange work and overcome difficulties. For work that could be done without dedicated personnel, such as cleaning the offices and courtyards, protecting and cultivating flowers and trees, he always took the lead and motivated everyone to complete it together. When the patients staying here were about to leave the sanatorium, many of them wrote letters to thank the old director and all the staff for their care and attention.

Every year, among the several sanatoriums under the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, the budget of the Jiang’an Sanatorium led by Zhang Shihhan is always smaller. But even when using these carefully calculated funds, Zhang Shihhan often considers how to spend even less. In 1953, the higher authorities approved the use of 1,200 yuan to hire laborers to fill in a large stinky pit in the sanatorium's courtyard. Zhang Shihhan thought that there were many families of railway workers near the sanatorium, and running the sanatorium was also for their happiness. Inviting them to volunteer labor could save a lot of money. So he went to the trade union to discuss it and went around mobilizing the families of the employees. He himself took the lead in carrying soil. As a result, only the money for buying baskets and buying prizes to reward the families of the employees was spent to fill in the stinky pit. Once, the sanatorium needed a large tea stove to boil water, and buying a new one would cost two to three hundred yuan. He thought it was too expensive and managed to buy an old gasoline drum for more than seventy yuan and converted it into a tea stove. Now, this specially made tea stove has been in use for more than two years and is just as effective as an ordinary tea stove.

Under the influence of the old director, the staff of the Jiang’an Sanatorium gradually developed a habit of thrift. From the beginning to the present, this sanatorium has not bought any furniture or sundries except for adding pajamas, benches, and a few filing cabinets for the patients. Even the painting work of the beds is done by the staff themselves. The patients' pajamas can generally only be used for three years, but their pajamas were carefully washed, properly maintained, and repaired in a timely manner, and were only discarded after five years. Every year, the miscellaneous expenses of this sanatorium are about 10% less than the budget. The higher-level financial departments praised them as a unit that never spends money recklessly.

Zhang Shihhan has always maintained the working class's tradition of hard work and plain living. These days, it is snowing heavily in Wuhan, and the temperature is below zero. However, in the room where Zhang Shihhan and his deputy director work, there is no stove, only a flue pipe passing through the roof at a high position radiates some heat. Previously, there were also stoves in their office. Not long ago, after the state called for saving coal for heating, Zhang Shihhan discussed with the deputy director: Since neither of them are often in the office, canceling the stove can save more than 300 kilograms of coal a month. So, the two of them dismantled the stove themselves and connected the flue pipe from the stove in the next office. Originally, the office chair Zhang Shihhan was sitting on was made of wood. In order to take care of his old age, the higher authorities wanted to replace it with a leather chair, but he resolutely refused after hearing about it. Now, he is still sitting on the wooden chair.

Zhang Shihhan's house is very simple, with bamboo skin walls on all sides and reed mats and tiles on the top. During the flood season in Wuhan in 1954, his house leaked rain above and was flooded below. He had no choice but to move to an empty room in the sanatorium, but he did not bring his wife with him. The staff of the sanatorium forcibly went to his house to move things before his wife was also moved in. However, not long after the flood season, his house had not yet dried, and he was busy moving back. The higher authorities and all the people in the sanatorium wanted him to live in the sanatorium, but he was worried that it would affect the convalescence of the patients and was unwilling. However, seeing that the houses of other staff members in the sanatorium were not good, he repeatedly mobilized them to move to the sanatorium.

During the "February 7th" Great Strike, Zhang Shihhan was a picket captain of the Yellow River South Bank Branch of the Railway Trade Union. Later, he was arrested and imprisoned for twenty-two months. The enemy repeatedly whipped him unconscious, but did not get any information from him. To this day, his body is still covered with scars. Now, Zhang Shihhan is an old "February 7th" worker respected by the youth of Wuhan. Schools, factories, and radio stations often invite him to tell the younger generation the story of the "February 7th" struggle. On the podium, he always likes to tell the young people: In the past, we were empty-handed, and now we have such a large family property, and we are all happy. I hope everyone will not forget that this was earned by the blood of the martyrs. Don't waste money, everyone should build our country diligently and thriftily.

    保持艰苦朴素传统的“二七”老工人张士汉	新华社记者　曹原德
    一走进中国铁路职工江岸疗养所，就有一种整洁、舒适的感觉。疗养室前后两个不大的院子里，树木井然成行，一排排冬青树被修剪得整整齐齐，花坛上一层层摆列着各色盆花。初来的人总以为这些院子一定有专人在负责打扫、管理。其实，这都是全所工作人员在七十一岁的老所长张士汉带领下抽空打扫的，树木、花草的修剪、灌浇、培育更全由老所长一个人担当。
    共产党员张士汉是武汉市著名的“二七”老工人。他从1951年江岸疗养所开办的时候起，就在这里担任所长。按照编制，这个疗养所应该有十九个工作人员。但开始时全所只有十二个工作人员，连洗涤病床上的用具都没有人做。张士汉脱下外衣、卷起袖子，就一个人洗起来。在他的影响下，全所工作人员连医生在内都抽空为病员洗床单、被子、枕套，克服了人手少的困难。1952年以后，疗养所的工作人员最多时有十六个人，最少时只有十一个人，但是张士汉却从来没有向上级叫苦，总是同大家一起商量怎样合理地安排工作，克服困难。像打扫办公室、院子，保护和培育花木等一些可以不设专人的工作，他一直是亲自动手，带动大家一起来完成。住在这里的疗养员们在将要离所的时候，总有很多人写信感谢老所长和全所工作人员对他们的体贴、照顾。
    每年，在郑州铁路管理局所属的几个疗养所里，张士汉领导的江岸疗养所的预算数字总要少一些。但是在使用这些已经经过精打细算的经费的时候，张士汉还常常在考虑怎样再能少花一点。1953年上级批准用一千二百元钱请民工填平所内院子里的一个大臭坑。张士汉想起疗养所附近有很多铁路工人的家属，办疗养所也是为了他们的幸福，请他们来义务劳动，可以省一大笔钱。于是他就到工会去商量，并且四处奔走去动员职工家属。他自己也带头挑土。结果，只花了买箩筐的钱和买奖品奖励职工家属的钱，就把臭水坑填平了。一次，所里需要一个大茶炉烧开水，买新的要两三百块钱。他嫌太贵，设法花七十多元买了一个旧汽油桶，把它改装成茶炉。现在，这个特制的茶炉已经用了两年多，还同普通茶炉一样顶事。
    江岸疗养所的工作人员在老所长的影响下，逐渐养成了节约的风气。从开办到现在，这座疗养所除了添置过病员的睡衣、板凳和几个装文件的柜子以外，再也没有买过什么家具杂物，连病床的油漆工作都是工作人员自己动手。病员的睡衣一般只能用三年，他们的睡衣因为洗涤小心，保管得当，修补及时，用了五年才报废。每年，这个疗养所杂费方面的开支总要比预算少10％左右。上级财务部门称赞他们是从不乱花钱的单位。
    张士汉始终保持着工人阶级艰苦朴素的生活作风。这几天武汉市大雪纷飞，气温在零度以下。但是在张士汉同他的副所长一起办公的房间里却找不到火炉，只有在高处穿屋而过的一根排烟管发散出一些热气。以前，他们的办公室里也是有火炉的，不久前国家号召节约取暖用煤以后，张士汉就同副所长商量：反正两个人都不经常在办公室，取消炉子一个月也可以少用三百多斤煤。于是，他们俩就自己动手拆掉了炉子，把隔壁办公室里炉子上的烟管接了过来。本来，张士汉坐的办公椅是木板制的。上级为了照顾他年老，要给他换一把皮椅，他听说以后，坚决不要。现在，他还是坐的木板椅子。
    张士汉住的房子很简陋，四壁是竹皮墙，顶上是芦席加瓦片。1954年武汉防汛期间，他的房子上面漏雨，下面浸水。他不得已搬到疗养所的空房里来住了，却没有把老伴一起带来。所里的工作人员硬到他家里去搬东西，才把他的老伴也迁来了。但是防汛以后不久，他的屋子地下还没干，他就忙着搬回去。上级和全所的人都要他住在所里，他却担心会影响病员的疗养而不愿意。但是，他看到所里其他工作人员家里的房子不好，却一再动员他们向所里搬。
    “二七”大罢工的时候，张士汉是铁路工会黄河南岸分会的一个纠察队长。以后被捕，在牢中被监禁了二十二个月。敌人数次用皮鞭打昏了他，也没有从他口中得到任何情况。至今他的身上还到处是斑斑伤痕。现在，张士汉是受到武汉全市青年尊敬的一位“二七”老工人。经常有学校、工厂、广播电台来邀请他去给青年一代讲“二七”斗争的故事。在讲坛上，他总欢喜告诉青年们说：过去我们是赤手空拳，现在我们有这样大的家当了，我们大家都幸福了。希望大家不要忘记这是先烈们流血挣来的。不要乱花钱，大家要勤勤俭俭建设我们的国家。
