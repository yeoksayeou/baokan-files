    On the third day of the Spring Festival, a motorcade fully loaded with tea, rice, and general merchandise braved the wind, snow, and severe cold to cross Que'er Mountain, the highest mountain on the Kangzang Highway, heading towards Tibet.

    The thirty-six drivers in this motorcade are all people who drive on high mountains and steep ranges year-round. In the past, they have delivered many supplies to the Tibetan people. This time, they responded to the call of the state-owned Sichuan Ya'an Transportation Company to "not rest during the Spring Festival, so that more people can have a good holiday," and drove as usual during the festival.

    On the first day of the Spring Festival, the drivers loaded the goods in Ganzi and checked the vehicles. On the second day, they set off in strong winds and heavy snow. The wind and snow often swept towards the motorcade. Ice flowers constantly formed on the windshields of the truck cabs, obscuring the road. The drivers often had to stick their heads out of the windows to check the road. Driver Chen Yixin looked at the howling wind and snow and said, "It doesn't matter, we must get through it!" He had already completed his transportation task for January. Two days before the Spring Festival, his wife and three-year-old child had made a special trip from Chongqing to his station to spend the holiday with him. After settling them in, he drove away.

    The snow stopped that evening, but the night came again. The ever-changing Que'er Mountain sky sparkled with the light of stars and the moon, and the undulating snow ridges and ice lakes appeared even more magnificent. The drivers rested overnight in a wooden house at the foot of Que'er Mountain, and in the hazy morning mist, they held the oven to warm and melt the engine oil. Then the engine roared to life. Captain Yang Hui issued the order to "put on the chains and start climbing the mountain." The motorcade, like a long snake, drove onto the snow-covered Que'er Mountain. The young and energetic Ren Lianyou took the lead, followed closely by Fu Chiguang, who had been driving on Erlang Mountain for many years and averaged more than 8,000 kilometers of extra mileage per tire. Pu Lin, who had driven safely for 150,000 kilometers, also came up, and the skilled and experienced Wei Qing took the rear.

    The higher the mountain, the greater the wind and snow, and the more difficult the road became. The strong wind constantly pushed the snow from the mountainside onto the road. The road surface was made bumpy and uneven by the ice and snow, and the trucks trembled and bumped forward. The drivers calmly held the steering wheels, kept their eyes fixed on the front, skillfully drove through dangerous roads and sharp turns, and followed the road signs specially placed by the road maintenance workers to pass the continuous steep slopes. In the morning, the thick fog on Que'er Mountain gradually dissipated, and the sun shone on the snow, reflecting a dazzling silver light. The drivers hurriedly put on black glasses and continued to drive.

    After they reached the top of Que'er Mountain, they encountered a motorcade coming from the west. The drivers of the two teams honked their horns and wished each other a happy Spring Festival.

    Que'er Mountain is 5,050 meters above sea level and is the highest mountain on the Kangzang Highway, covered with ice and snow all year round. In 1951, road builders fought here for several months, and some of them did not descend the mountain until the Spring Festival was approaching. Since then, almost every year during the Spring Festival, motorcades have passed through Que'er Mountain. To ensure the smooth passage of this section of the road, dozens of Han Chinese road maintenance workers have spent several years on the mountain.

    越过雀儿山
    新华社记者　赵家烈
    在春节的第三天，有一支满载茶叶、大米和百货的汽车队，冒着风雪严寒，翻过康藏公路上最高的雀儿山开往西藏。
    这个车队的三十六名驾驶员，都是常年在高山峻岭上行车的人。过去，他们为藏族人民送去过许多物资。这次他们又响应国营四川省雅安运输公司“春节不休息，使更多的人过好节”的号召，在节日里照常行车。
    在春节第一天，驾驶员们在甘孜装好货物，检查了车辆，第二天就冒着狂风大雪出发。风雪时常向车队横扫过来。汽车驾驶室前面的玻璃上不断结上冰花，看不清路，驾驶员们时常从车窗里伸出头去探望道路。驾驶员陈义鑫看了看呼啸而来的风雪说：“没有关系，一定要挺过去！”他已经完成了1月份的运输任务。在春节的前两天，他的爱人和三岁的孩子，特别从重庆赶到他的驻地来，准备同他一块过节。他把她们安顿好以后，就驾着车走了。
    当天傍晚雪停了，但是夜又来了，瞬息万变的雀儿山上空，闪着星月的光辉，起伏不断的雪岭和冰湖显得更加壮丽。驾驶员们在雀儿山下的木屋里休息了一夜，又在晨雾朦胧中，端着烤车火炉，烘化开引擎上的机油。接着马达吼起来了。队长杨辉发出了“挂上链条开始爬山”的命令。车队像一字长蛇阵似地开上积雪皑皑的雀儿山。年轻活跃的任连友领头往上爬，长年行驶在二郎山上，平均每个轮胎超额行驶八千多公里的傅炽光紧跟着，安全行驶十五万公里的蒲林也上来了，技术好有经验的危清走“压阵”。
    山越高，风雪越大，路也更难走了，大风不断把山坡上的积雪推到公路上来。路面被冰雪弄得坎坷不平，汽车颤抖着颠簸着前进。驾驶员们沉着地握着方向盘，两眼紧盯着前方，机警地驶过险路和急弯，又按照养路工人特置的路标驶过接连不断的陡坡。早晨，雀儿山上的浓雾渐渐散了，太阳照在积雪上，反射出了射眼的银光。驾驶员急忙戴上黑色眼镜继续开车。
    他们上了雀儿山顶以后，遇到了从西面开来的一个车队。两队的驾驶员们按着喇叭，互祝春节愉快。
    雀儿山顶海拔五千零五十公尺，是康藏公路上最高的一座山，常年披戴着冰雪。1951年，筑路人员曾经在这里搏斗过好几个月，有些人临到过春节才下山。从那以后，几乎每年的春节里都有车队从雀儿山上通过。为了保证这段公路的畅通，几十名汉族道班工人，已经在山上度过了好几个年头。
