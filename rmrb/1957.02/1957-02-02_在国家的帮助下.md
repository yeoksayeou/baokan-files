    With the Help of the State
                Nie Binhua
    In Qingxiang Street, Jinan City, there is a rug weaving production group for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Except for a few technical personnel, those working here are all families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. The group's products have high output, good quality, and low prices, and are sold throughout Shandong Province, and are very popular among the masses.
    Two years ago, the scale of this rug weaving group was very small, only using some waste cotton to weave a few rugs to maintain a living. However, the Municipal People's Committee took great care of it, first organizing three people to visit and study at the Qingdao Military Dependents Rug Weaving Factory, and later allocating more than 70,000 yuan to purchase various machines for them and install electrical equipment. This changed the small-scale handicraft production to semi-mechanized production; the number of people participating in production increased from more than a dozen at the beginning to ninety-eight; the monthly output increased from more than one hundred to more than one thousand six hundred.
    The care and support of the state stimulated their labor enthusiasm, and production efficiency quickly doubled. In the second half of last year, twenty-nine people were rated as advanced producers.
    With the improvement of production, their living standards have also gradually improved. Last December, the average wage income of the whole group was 27 yuan per person. Every household added new clothes and quilts, dressed warmly, ate well, and everyone was all smiles. The family of martyr Zhang Jingquan, a family of four, used to rely on government relief for a long time. Since his daughter joined the rug weaving, her monthly income has been more than 50 yuan, and the whole family's life has been quite wealthy. Looking at the current situation, how can they not be grateful to the government?

    在国家的帮助下
                聂伯华
    在济南市庆祥街，有个烈、军属织毯生产组，在这里工作的除个别技术人员外，都是烈、军属、残废军人、复员军人。这个组的产品产量高，质量也好，价格便宜，行销山东省各地，很受群众欢迎。
    两年前，这个制毯组的规模很小，只是弄些废棉花来织几条毯子，维持生活而已。可是，市人民委员会对它关怀备至，先是组织三个人到青岛军属织毯厂参观、学习，后来又前后拨款七万余元，为他们购置各种机器，并安装了电力设备。使小型的手工业生产，改为半机器生产；参加生产的人数由开始十余人增加到九十八人；月产量由原来百余条增加到一千六百余条。
    国家的关心和支持，激发了他们的劳动热情，生产效率很快地提高了一倍，去年下半年有二十九人被评为先进生产者。
    随着生产的提高，他们的生活也逐步有了改善。去年12月，全组每人工资收入平均二十七元。家家户户添做了新衣新被，穿的暖，吃的香，人人都喜笑颜开。烈属张景泉大爷一家四口人，过去长期依靠政府救济，自从他的女儿参加织毯后，每月收入五十余元，全家的生活过得挺富裕。看看眼前情景，他们怎能不感激政府呢？
