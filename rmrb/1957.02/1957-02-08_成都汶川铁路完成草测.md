    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 3rd. The preliminary survey work for the Chengdu-Wenchuan Railway has recently been completed. This line, which connects the western Sichuan Plain and the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and is to be constructed to meet the needs of developing the upper reaches of the Minjiang River's hydropower and forest resources, is approximately 140 kilometers long.

    Starting in November last year, two survey teams from the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways braved the severe cold and advanced from both ends of Chengdu and Wenchuan County in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture at an average surveying speed of four kilometers per day.

    The Chengdu-Wenchuan Railway starts from Chengdu, passes through Pixian, Chongning, and Guanxian in the western Sichuan Plain, and then goes along the Minjiang River to reach Wenchuan.

    成都汶川铁路完成草测
    新华社成都3日电　成（都）汶（川）铁路草测工作最近已经完成。这条沟通川西平原和阿坝藏族自治州，为满足开发岷江上游水力和森林资源的需要而准备修建的线路，全长约一百四十公里。
    从去年11月开始，铁道部第二设计院的两支勘测队伍，冒着严寒，每天平均以四公里的测量速度，从成都和阿坝藏族自治州汶川县两端分头前进。
    成汶铁路从成都起，经过川西平原的郫县、崇宁、灌县，然后沿岷江而上到达汶川。
