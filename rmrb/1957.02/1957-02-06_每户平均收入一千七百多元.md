　　Average Income per Household Exceeds 1,700 Yuan

　　(Our report) The Xinmin Subtropical Economic Crop Production Cooperative in Wanning County, Hainan Island, was formed by twenty-four returned overseas Chinese families in April last year. As soon as the cooperative was established, its director, Wang Dongzhao, led forty-six members to march into the wasteland. After the hard work of the members, 479 mu of wasteland were reclaimed. In addition to planting 48 mu of rice, the rest were planted with cash crops, including 408 mu of citronella, 17 mu of coffee, and 6 mu of derris.

　　Thanks to the diligent cultivation of the members and the construction of a dam for irrigation, the rice and cash crops grew very well. After the harvest, the income from citronella alone was 43,240 yuan. Including the income from derris, rice, and other crops, the total income of the cooperative reached 46,300 yuan. After deducting costs and basic construction expenses, as well as public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, the net income was 42,670 yuan, with an average income of more than 1,700 yuan per household.

　　With the increase in income, the lives of the members have improved greatly, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher. They have successively proposed expanding planting. According to the requirements of the members, the cooperative plans to expand the planting area by 150 mu this year. They have now reclaimed another 50 mu of wasteland and cultivated 6,000 citronella seedlings. Cooperative Director Wang Dongzhao said excitedly: After the production plan for this year is realized, the income of the members will be much higher than last year. (Li Zifang)

    每户平均收入一千七百多元
    本报讯　海南岛万宁县新民亚热带经济作物生产合作社，是由二十四户归国华侨在去年4月组成的。这个社一建成，社主任王东钊便领导四十六个社员向荒地进军。经过社员们艰苦的劳动，开垦了四百七十九亩荒地。他们除种了四十八亩水稻外，其余的都种上了经济作物。计：香茅四百零八亩，咖啡十七亩，毒鱼藤六亩。
    由于社员们辛勤的培育，再加上他们修筑了一座水坝来引水灌溉，水稻和经济作物成长的很好。收获以后，只香茅一项，就收入四万三千二百四十元。连上毒鱼藤、稻谷等收入，全社的总收入达到四万六千三百元。除掉成本和基本建设费用，再扣掉公积金和公益金，纯收入就有四万二千六百七十元，平均每户收入一千七百多元。
    随着收入的增加，社员们的生活过得很好，他们的生产情绪就更高涨了，纷纷提出扩大种植的要求。社里根据社员的要求，计划今年扩大种植面积一百五十亩。现在，他们已经又开垦了五十亩荒地，并培育了六千棵香茅苗。社主任王东钊兴奋地说：今年的生产计划实现以后，社员们的收入比去年还要多得多。　（黎子方）
