People's Lawyer - Guardian of Revolutionary Legality
	Liu Yueqing

	Some people criticize lawyers for being "unsteady in their stance" simply because they defend the accused in certain cases! Some even demand that the government arrest and punish them according to the law. Of course, such people are few in number, but a lack of understanding of the people's lawyer system is more widespread. I think it is meaningful to talk about this issue.

	First, it is because "the accused has the right to defense." This provision in the Constitution (Article 76) and the Organic Law of the People's Courts (Article 7) meets practical needs. The Organic Law of the People's Courts stipulates that in addition to himself, the accused may also invite others, primarily entrusting lawyers to defend him. In fact, apart from lawyers, other people (including the accused) often do not understand the law and are not good at presenting favorable evidence and reasons; some even refuse to defend the accused. As is well known, the Li Wanming case was prosecuted by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, and prosecutors appeared in court to support the public prosecution. They were familiar with the law. The defendant, Li Wanming, lacked legal knowledge, and he could not find other suitable defenders. In order to achieve genuine equality in litigation rights, it is absolutely necessary for lawyers with legal knowledge, standing on the side of the state and the people, to defend the legitimate rights and interests of the accused. The Organic Law of the People's Courts stipulates that the court may also appoint a defender for the accused when it deems it necessary. The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court, based on the defendant's request, legally appointed a lawyer to defend him. It should also be noted that some of our judicial staff, in pursuing and punishing crimes, have made wrong accusations and wrong judgments due to subjective and one-sided shortcomings. Zhou Yongchun, the director of an agricultural cooperative in Yutian County, Hebei Province, was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the Yutian County Court of Hebei Province for counter-revolutionary sabotage of the agricultural cooperative, based on "reports" from others. After he appealed, and after the lawyer's defense, the Tangshan Special District Intermediate People's Court overturned the sentence and released him without charge. This example fully illustrates that the defense of a lawyer is necessary to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the accused and to safeguard the people's democratic legal system. The lawyer's defense can, based on facts and the law, refute the accusation, help the court to comprehensively consider all aspects of the defendant's situation, and promote the court's implementation of legal provisions such as openness, jury, and appeal litigation systems, so as to ensure the correct handling of the case. The correct handling of the Li Wanming case should first be attributed to the judicial staff's impartial enforcement of the law and their realistic approach; however, the lawyer also played an active role in helping the court to fully clarify the case.

	Secondly, in order to better punish and reform criminals. Good people certainly cannot be wronged, and even for criminals, different legal treatments should be given according to their criminal circumstances. The judgment must be appropriate, and the sentencing must be accurate. The idea that any criminal can be sentenced arbitrarily, regardless of the severity, is wrong and violates the spirit of our country's legal system. The defendant Li Wanming was guilty. What crime did he commit? How should he be punished? At the beginning, people's views were not the same: some said that he was a counter-revolutionary and should be sentenced to life imprisonment or death; others said that he was a political swindler and should be sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. This requires the court to correctly determine the crime and impose the sentence. If he is regarded as a counter-revolutionary, the sentence will be too heavy. This will not only fail to maintain the legal system but also fail to actively reform and educate the criminals, and may even cause legitimate dissatisfaction among the masses. During the trial, the lawyer defended the defendant according to law, from the nature of the crime and the facts of the crime, which not only provided a reference for the court to determine the crime and sentencing, but also educated the criminals and made them confess their guilt and obey the law. This is exactly what happened: the defendant repeatedly confessed his crimes in court; the court fairly determined that he was a political fraud and sentenced him to 15 years of imprisonment and deprived him of political rights for five years (the deprivation of political rights is calculated from the expiration of the sentence), and he did not appeal. In this way, the defendant can sincerely accept the judgment and carry out self-reform, which is conducive to our achieving good results in the struggle against crime.

	A lawyer defending the accused is beneficial to the country and the people, and it also protects the legitimate rights and interests of the accused. It should be said that their position is firm.

	In addition to acting as defense counsel for criminal defendants, people's lawyers also act as civil agents in litigation. They satisfactorily answer the legal questions raised by citizens, and also actively advise citizens to stop litigation and adopt methods of consultation and reconciliation to resolve civil disputes based on national laws and the principle of mutual consent, trying their best to reduce disputes and promote internal unity among the people; and actively prevent crime to consolidate social order. A certain citizen and his wife had been married for ten years and had always had a good relationship. Later, he discovered that the woman had cohabited with someone before marriage and had given birth to a child. He was troubled by this and wanted a divorce. According to the basic spirit of the Marriage Law and their specific circumstances, the lawyer of the Beijing No. 1 Legal Advisory Office pointed out that although the woman had improper behavior before marriage, she performed very well after marriage, and now the relationship between husband and wife is harmonious, so filing for divorce is not only unreasonable but also not allowed by law. As a result, he did not sue. In this way, on the one hand, legal publicity and education work was carried out to citizens, so that citizens consciously abide by the law; on the other hand, the number of court cases was reduced. Even if citizens want to go to court for litigation, because of the help of lawyers, who tell them the litigation procedures and write the litigation documents for them, it not only facilitates citizens to conduct litigation, but also has a positive effect on the court; relatively, it reduces the work of the court's people's reception room in this regard, which is very helpful for improving the efficiency of handling cases. The adjudicators are satisfied with the work of the lawyers. When lawyers solve problems for citizens, the masses say: "Lawyer, I will never forget you..." Some treat lawyers as their relatives and ask to make friends with lawyers.

	People's lawyers are the legal advisors of the people, the assistants of trial work, and the guardians of the people's democratic legal system. They are deeply loved and trusted by the people. Therefore, we should actively promote and support the people's lawyer system, which is of great benefit to consolidating the people's democratic legal system.

    人民律师——革命法制的维护者
    刘岳清
    某些案件由于有律师为被告辩护，有人就责难律师是“立场不稳”！甚至要求政府把他们逮捕法办。当然这样的人为数极少，但是不了解人民律师制度的，却较为普遍。我觉得就这个问题谈一谈是有意义的。
    首先，是因为“被告人有权获得辩护”。宪法（第七十六条）和人民法院组织法（第七条）这种规定，是切合实际需要的。法院组织法规定：被告除了自己以外，还可以请其他的人，首先是委托律师为他辩护。事实上，除了律师以外，其他人（包括被告）往往因为不懂法律，不善于提出有利的证据和理由，甚至有些人拒绝为被告辩护。众所周知的李万铭案件，是由北京市人民检察院起诉并由检察员到庭支持公诉，他们是熟悉法律的，被告李万铭缺乏法律知识，他又找不到其他适当的辩护人，为了实现诉讼权利的真正平等，由具有法律知识的律师，站在国家与人民的立场，为被告的合法权益作辩护，是绝对必需的。人民法院组织法规定：法院认为必要时，也可以为被告指定辩护人。北京市中级人民法院正是根据被告的请求，依法为被告指定律师为他辩护。还应当看到：我们某些司法工作人员在追究、惩罚犯罪中，由于存在主观、片面的缺点，产生过错起诉、错判决的现象。河北玉田县农民周永春经社主任的“检举”，被河北省玉田县法院以反革命破坏农业社罪，判刑十五年。他不服上诉后，经过律师的辩护，唐山专区中级人民法院改判他为无罪释放。这个例子，就充分说明律师的辩护对维护被告的合法权益，对维护人民民主法制是必需的。律师的辩护，就能根据事实与法律，反驳控诉，帮助法院全面考虑被告的各方面的情况，并促进法院贯彻执行法律规定的公开、陪审、上诉等诉讼制度，保证案件正确的处理。李万铭案件所以得到正确处理，首先应归功于这些司法工作人员执法从公、实事求是的工作作风；但律师对于帮助法院全面弄清案情，也起着积极的作用。
    其次，为了更好地惩罚和改造犯罪者。好人固然不能冤枉，就是对于犯罪者也要分别他们犯罪情况作不同的法律处理，判决必须得当，量刑必须准确。那种认为凡是犯罪分子就可以随便判刑，轻重都无所谓的想法是不对的，是违反我们国家法制的精神的。被告李万铭是有罪的，他到底犯了什么罪？如何处刑？在开始的时候，人们的看法并不一样：有的说，他是反革命分子，应判无期徒刑或死刑；有的说，他是政治骗子，应判有期徒刑十五年。这就要求法院要正确地定罪量刑，如果把他当成反革命分子，判刑一定会偏重，这不但不能很好地维护法制，也不能从积极方面改造教育犯罪者，甚至会引起群众正当的不满。而律师在审理过程中，依法从被告犯罪性质、犯罪事实入情入理地为被告作了辩护，这不仅对法院认罪定刑，提供了参考的意见；也教育了犯罪者，使其认罪服法。事实也正是这样：被告在法庭上一再承认了自己所犯罪行；法院公正地认定他是政治诈骗，判处他有期徒刑十五年并剥夺政治权利五年（剥夺政治权利是从刑期期满后起算），他也没有上诉。这样，就使被告能够心悦诚服地接受判决，进行自我改造，也就便于我们收到和犯罪作斗争的良好效果。
    律师为被告作辩护，对国家和人民是有益的，也保护了被告的合法权益，应当说，他们的立场是稳的。
    人民律师参加诉讼，除了作刑事被告的辩护人外，还作民事代理人。他们圆满的解答公民所提出的法律问题，还主动地根据国家法律和双方自愿原则，劝解公民息讼，采取协商、和解的方式来解决民事争端，尽力减少纠纷，促进人民内部团结；并积极预防犯罪，以巩固社会秩序。公民某同其妻结婚十年，一贯感情很好，后发现女方婚前曾与人同居，生过孩子，他为这个事情感到苦恼，想离婚。北京市第一法律顾问处的律师根据婚姻法的基本精神及他们的具体情况指出，女方婚前虽然有不正当的行为，但婚后表现很好，现在夫妻感情融洽，提出离婚，既不合乎情理，也是法律所不准许的。结果，他没有起诉。这样，一方面向公民进行了法律的宣传教育工作，使公民自觉地遵守法律；另方面，减少了法院的案件。即使公民要到法院进行诉讼，因为有了律师的帮助，告诉诉讼程序和代写了诉讼文书，不只是便利公民进行诉讼，对法院也有积极作用；相对地减少了法院人民接待室在这方面的工作，对提高办案效率很有帮助。审判人员对律师这些工作是满意的。当律师为公民解决了问题的时候，群众说：“律师，我永远忘不了您。……”有的把律师当成自己的亲人，要求和律师交朋友。
    人民律师是人民的法律顾问，是审判工作的助手，是人民民主法制的维护者。他们深受人民的爱戴与信任。因此，我们应该积极推行与支持人民律师制度，这对巩固人民民主法制是大有好处的。
