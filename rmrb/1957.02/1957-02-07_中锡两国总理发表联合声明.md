Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, February 5th: (Delayed) Joint Statement of the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and Ceylon

We, the Prime Ministers of the People's Republic of China and Ceylon, discussed many issues of common concern to our two countries during the Chinese Premier's visit to Ceylon. Our talks were full, frank, and conducted in a very cordial and friendly atmosphere.

We reaffirm our firm adherence to the principles accepted by the Asian-African countries gathered in Bandung in 1955, which are the five principles of co-existence and cooperation among nations, widely known as Panchsheel. We believe that positive steps should be taken to promote the implementation of these principles, and for this purpose, another Asian-African conference should be convened at the earliest appropriate time.

World history is in a period of transition. In such times, we can often find different views and different social concepts. But we believe that despite differences and different social systems, countries can coexist peacefully. World war, or the creation or continuation of any conditions leading to such a war, cannot be allowed. International disputes should be resolved through mutual understanding and peaceful negotiations. Therefore, we express our opposition to hostile military blocs, support disarmament, and emphasize the necessity of banning nuclear weapons and ceasing the testing of such weapons.

At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the solidarity of Asian and African countries to resist the aggression and expansion of imperialist and colonialist forces in this region, which are desperately attempting to hinder the efforts of the people of the world to seek freedom and progress in the spirit of the new era.

Regarding the situation in Egypt and West Asia, we believe that the continuation of power politics, or the replacement of one great power by another in the name of filling the so-called vacuum, will not contribute to solving the problems in this region. The people of the countries in this region must have the freedom to decide their own destiny according to their own will. Only in this way can collective peace in this region be guaranteed, and international disputes can be resolved peacefully.

We are deeply concerned about the unfortunate situation caused by the dispute between Pakistan and India over Kashmir. We call on the parties concerned, for their own benefit and for the broader interests of Asian-African solidarity, to further strive for a peaceful resolution of this issue.

Our two countries have been linked by ties of friendship for many centuries. While recognizing and respecting the differences in views that may exist between us, we are determined to strengthen these ties, develop economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between our two countries, and promote cooperation conducive to the solidarity of our two countries, Asian-African solidarity, and world peace.

    中锡两国总理发表联合声明
    新华社科伦坡5日电　（迟到）中华人民共和国总理周恩来和锡兰总理班达拉奈克，5日上午十一时四十分在锡兰参议院大厦签署了联合声明。
    新华社科伦坡5日电　（迟到）中华人民共和国和锡兰两国总理的联合声明
    我们，中华人民共和国和锡兰两国总理，在中国总理访问锡兰的期间，讨论了我们两国共同关心的许多问题。我们的会谈是充分的，坦率的，而且是在十分亲切和友好的气氛中进行的。
    我们重申，我们坚决遵守1955年在万隆集会的亚非国家所接受的原则，它们是关于各国共处和合作的五项原则即被普遍称为潘查希拉的扩大。我们认为，应该采取积极的步骤促进这些原则的实施，并且为此目的，在适当的最早时候召开另一次亚非会议。
    世界历史正处于一个过渡的时期。在这样的时代里，我们经常可以发现不同的看法和不同的社会概念。但是我们相信，虽然有着分歧和不同的社会制度，各国是可以和平相处的。世界战争，或者任何导向这种战争的条件的制造或者延续，都是不能允许的。国际争端应该通过相互谅解和和平谈判求得解决。因此，我们表示反对敌对性的军事集团，支持裁军，并且强调禁止核子武器和停止试验这种武器的必要。
    同时，有必要加强亚非国家的团结，以反对帝国主义和殖民主义势力在这个地区的侵略和扩张，这些势力正在拚命地企图阻挠世界人民按照新时代的精神努力求取的自由和进步。
    关于埃及和西亚的局势，我们认为，强权政治的延续，或者一个强国在填满所谓真空的名义下对别的强国的替代，都不能有助于解决这个地区的问题。这个地区的各国人民必须有自由按照自己的意志决定自己的命运。只有这样，这个地区的集体和平才能够得到保证，国际争端才能够求得和平解决。
    我们对于巴基斯坦和印度关于克什米尔的争执所引起的不幸局势深感不安。我们呼吁有关双方，为了他们自己的利益，同时也为了亚非团结的更广泛的利益，进一步争取这个问题的和平解决。
    我们两国在许多世纪以来就是被友谊的联系所联结着的。在承认并且尊重可能存在于我们之间的观点的差异的同时，我们决定要增强这些联系，发展我们两国之间的经济合作和文化交流，促进有利于我们两国和亚非团结以及世界和平的合作。

              锡　兰　总　理　班达拉奈克
