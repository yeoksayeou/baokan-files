    Evidence of Imperialist Aggression Against Our Country
    A Large Batch of Historical Photo Negatives Discovered in Tianjin
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 24th. The Tianjin History Museum recently acquired a batch of historical photo negatives, which powerfully exposes the crimes of the imperialists' aggression against China and the feudalist and bureaucratic capitalist rulers' exploitation of the people.
    This batch of negatives totals 3,054 pieces, including images of the British army in the Tianjin concession "demonstrating" to the Chinese people in front of Gordon Hall (now the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee office building); evidence of the Eight-Nation Alliance occupying Tianjin Railway Station when attacking Tianjin; and the situation of Japanese imperialists setting up defenses in the Sino-Japanese border area when preparing to launch the July 7th Incident. These photo negatives also tell people that the feudalist and bureaucratic capitalist rulers, who were always obsequious to foreigners, were so brutal to the people. The photo negatives record the tragic scene of starving and freezing people scrambling for meager porridge in the cold wind and failing to get any; scenes of the rulers suppressing people's resistance; and the ugly spectacle of military and political personnel of the reactionary government bowing and scraping to the foreign invading army in front of the former Hebei Provincial Government (destroyed during the July 7th Incident).
    In this batch of negatives, there are also some that record the scenery and historical sites of Beijing and Tianjin, and materials of historical value to the development of Tianjin's urban area. Many prosperous streets in Tianjin now were once desolate areas.
    This batch of negatives was taken by a German who opened a Kodak photo studio in Tianjin. These photo negatives, intended to promote the "military might" of imperialism and defame the Chinese people, have now become evidence of the imperialists' aggression against the Chinese people. This batch of negatives has now been sorted out by the Tianjin History Museum.

    帝国主义侵略我国罪证
    天津发现大批历史照片底版
    新华社天津24日电　天津市历史博物馆最近获得一批历史照片底版，它有力地揭露了帝国主义者侵略中国和封建主义、官僚资本主义统治者剥削人民的罪恶。
    这批底版共三千零五十四张，其中有天津刚辟租界英国军队在戈登堂（现在是天津市人民委员会的办公大楼）前向中国人民“示威”的情况；有八国联军攻天津时进占天津车站的罪证；还有日本帝国主义者准备发动七七事变时在中日交界区设防的情形。这些照片底版还告诉人们：一向媚外的封建主义和官僚资本主义统治者对人民是那样的残暴。照片底版记录了饥寒交迫的人民在寒风中抢领稀粥而不得的悲惨情形；有统治者镇压人民反抗的场面；还有反动政府的军政人员在前河北省政府（已于七七事变时被毁）门前向外国侵略军奴颜婢膝的丑相。
    在这一批底片中还有一部分记录了京津风景古迹和对天津市区发展有历史价值的资料。现在天津许多繁华的街道那时还是一片荒凉地区。
    这一批底片是一个德国人在天津开设的柯达照相馆拍摄的。这些目的在于宣扬帝国主义的“军威”和污蔑中国人民的照片底片现在已成为帝国主义者侵略中国人民的罪证。这批底片现在已由天津市历史博物馆整理出来。
