    Untying the Rope (Fable)
    In the shade of the willows, a small boat is moored.
    Three children jump onto the boat; they want to set it adrift in the middle of the stream and see the scenery of the green waves of spring.
    They don't seem to be acting recklessly: the first steers the rudder; the second rows the scull; the third first raises the mast, ready to hoist the sail at any sign of wind, and then turns back to help the second row the scull.
    They are full of energy, with division of labor and cooperation between them, as is often said in papers: from this, it can be seen that the subjective conditions are very good.
    Moreover, the weather is sunny and bright, and the wind and waves are calm, as is often said in papers: from this, it can be seen that the objective conditions are also very good.
    Unfortunately, however, the boat remains in the same place. - It turns out that everything was thought to be properly arranged, but the rope tied to the willow tree has not been untied!
    Is this just a joke made by children? When we accidentally hear some aimless reports, encounter some specific measures that fail to grasp the key, and see some casually chosen directions of effort, shouldn't we say:
    "After rowing the boat for so long, it turns out the rope hasn't been untied!"

    解缆（寓言）
    柳荫里停着一条小船。
    三个孩子跳上船去；他们要放于中流，看一看春水绿波的风光。
    他们好像也不是胡来一气的孩子：第一个掌舵；第二个摇橹；第三个先竖起桅杆，准备随时见风使篷，然后又回过身来帮助第二个摇橹。
    他们的劲头儿大，彼此之间有分工又有合作，正如论文里常说的：由此可知，主观条件很好。
    加之天晴日丽，风平浪静，正如论文里常说的：由此可知，客观条件也很好。
    然而不幸得很，船始终还在老地方。——原来以为一切都安排妥善了，却想不到缚在柳树上的缆还没解掉哩！
    这难道只是孩子们闹的笑话？当我们偶然听到一些不得要领的报告，遇到一些没有抓住关键的具体措施，看到一些信手拈来的努力方向，我们岂不要说：
    “摇了半天的船，原来缆还没有解哩！”
