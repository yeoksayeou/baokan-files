The Voice of the Japanese Working People

The following poems are translated from the collection of liberation poems by workers "Rainbow of Keihin" edited by the Japanese Theoretical Company. The Tokyo-Yokohama area is the heart of Japanese industry and the center of power for monopoly capital. Under the American occupation, the working people here launched a heroic struggle to improve their lives and fight for independence, freedom, and peace. The language of these poems is simple and honest, truly expressing the feelings of the Japanese working people and coming from their hearts.

    Cannon
    Azuma Koji
    The cannon is moving,
    The cannon is moving,
    On the roads of Japan,
    On the land of Japan,
    Thousands, hundreds,
    The cannon is moving.
    The cannon is moving,
    Shaking the earth,
    Shaking the houses,
    Roaring
    The cannon is moving.
    The cannon is moving,
    In front of us,
    Raising dust,
    Damaging the roadbeds,
    The cannon is moving.
    The cannon is moving,
    Foreign cannon,
    Shaking the earth,
    Shaking the houses,
    Raising dust
    In front of us Japanese,
    The cannon is moving.
    The cannon is moving,
    Foreign cannon is moving,
    Even though Japan does not need cannon,
    The cannon is moving.
    Our Town
    Nomoto Haruichi
    Our town is a small country town,
    I have been deeply blessed by it for forty years.
    I know every corner well,
    This street, that alley.
    Even a strange visitor from afar,
    Will not be treated as an outsider.
    Who says to live, then live in the capital?
    I would rather live in this small town all my life.
    Precisely because of this,
    I don't want it to be a munitions factory,
    I don't want foreign soldiers running wild here,
    Even more, I don't want it to be turned into a wilderness, burned to ashes,
    This feeling,
    If spoken out, everyone can understand,
    Everyone in our small town.
    Sewing
    Ita Shizuko
    I'm thinking like this in my heart:
    Sewing this shirt,
    The travel expenses will be settled,
    My husband in the hospital has a high fever,
    I tread on the sewing machine all night.
    Just for a
    Red paper summons, [1]
    Even worse than a warhorse,
    His tormented body,
    His chest so emaciated like a piece of paper, [2]
    My husband lying motionless.
    Dad is sick,
    Mom is sewing,
    Singing all alone,
    My five-year-old son.

    Translator's Notes:
    [1] During the war of aggression, conscription notices were on red paper. Anyone who received this red paper summons had to become cannon fodder for the invading army.
    [2] Refers to the chest of someone with a severe lung disease (with picture)

### 日本劳动人民的心声

    日本劳动人民的心声
    下面几首诗译自日本理论社编辑部所编的劳动者解放诗集“京滨之虹”。东京——横滨地区是日本工业的心脏；是垄断资本的势力中心。在美军占领下，这里的劳动人民为改善自己生活，为争取独立、自由、和平而展开英勇的斗争。这些诗原文文字纯朴，真实地表达了日本劳动人民的感情，是出自他们心坎的呼声。

    大炮
    吾妻浩治
    大炮在行进，
    大炮在行进，
    在日本的道路上，
    在日本的国土上，
    千门，百门，
    大炮在行进。
    大炮在行进，
    震响着大地，
    摇动着房屋，
    轰隆隆地
    大炮在行进。
    大炮在行进，
    在我们面前，
    扬起了尘埃，
    损坏着路基，
    大炮在行进。
    大炮在行进，
    外国的大炮，
    震响着大地，
    摇动着房屋，
    在我们日本人面前，
    扬起了尘埃大炮在行进。
    大炮在行进，
    外国的大炮在行进，
    尽管日本并不需要大炮，
    大炮在行进。
    我们的城镇
    野本春一
    我们的城镇是乡下的小镇，
    四十年来我受它的深恩。
    哪一个角落我都熟识，
    这条街，那条巷。
    就是陌生的远客，
    也不会被当作外人。
    谁说要住就住在京城？
    我却一生愿住在这小镇。
    正因为这个，
    不愿让它作军需工厂，
    不愿外国兵在这儿放肆，
    更不愿它被变成旷野，烧成灰烬，
    这个心情
    说出来，谁都能了解，
    我们小镇上所有的人。
    缝衣
    板静子
    心里这样盘算着：
    缝起这衬衫，
    路费就会有着落，
    在医院里的丈夫正发着高烧，
    我整夜踏着缝衣机。
    就为了一张
    红纸的征召，〔一〕
    连军马也不如的
    被折磨的身体，
    胸膛瘦瘪得像张纸，〔二〕
    我那躺着不动的丈夫。
    爸爸病倒了，
    妈妈在缝衣，
    独自一个在唱歌，
    我那五岁的儿。
    译者注：
    〔一〕侵略战争的时候，征兵通知是用红色的纸，只要收到这张红纸征召，就须去当侵略军的炮灰。
    〔二〕指肺病沉重的人的胸膛（附图片）
