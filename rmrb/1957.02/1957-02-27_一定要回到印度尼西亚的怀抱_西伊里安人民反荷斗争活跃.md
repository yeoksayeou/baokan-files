Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 29th - According to individuals who escaped from West Irian to the Antara News Agency, the people of West Irian's struggle against Dutch colonialism is very active. Generally speaking, Dutch troops only control the large cities. The anti-Dutch colonial activities on the various islands and the activities on the West Irian mainland have good connections, which makes the Dutch military's suppression ineffective.

The aforementioned individuals said that throughout West Irian, the most active are the "Indonesian Irian Liberation Movement" and the "Indonesian Irian Independence Party." Both organizations have branches in various places.

The aforementioned individuals said that in the big cities, a large number of leaflets are found almost every night, calling for attacks on the Dutch troops and striving to return to the embrace of Indonesia. In the Maoke Mountains, there were attacks on Dutch military outposts at the end of last year.

    一定要回到印度尼西亚的怀抱
    西伊里安人民反荷斗争活跃
    新华社雅加达29日电　据从西伊里安逃出的人士对安塔拉通讯社记者说，西伊里安人民反对荷兰殖民主义的斗争很活跃。一般说来，荷兰军队只是控制着大城市，各岛屿的反对荷兰殖民主义活动和西伊里安本土的活动有着良好的联系，这使得荷军的镇压行动没有收到效果。
    上述人士说，在全西伊里安，最活跃的是“印度尼西亚伊里安解放运动”和“印度尼西亚伊里安独立党”，这两个组织在各地都有支部。
    上述人士说，在大城市里，几乎每晚都发现大量传单，号召打击荷军和争取回到印度尼西亚的怀抱。在马老奇山区，去年底曾有人袭击荷军岗哨。
