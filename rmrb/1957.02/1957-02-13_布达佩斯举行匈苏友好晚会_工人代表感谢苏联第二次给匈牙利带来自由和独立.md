Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 12th: A Hungarian-Soviet friendship evening was held at the Csepel Iron and Steel Works in Budapest on the 9th, according to TASS.

　　The steel mill's gymnasium, which can accommodate 1,500 people, was decorated with the national flags of Hungary and the Soviet Union, as well as slogans. Members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party from the 21st district of Budapest and workers from the factory attended the evening with their families. Soviet officers and soldiers were also present at the evening.

　　Kish, the secretary of the Budapest 21st District Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, delivered a speech welcoming the guests. On behalf of all the workers of Csepel, he thanked the Soviet comrades for bringing freedom and independence to Hungary for the second time. He said that the rebellion plotted by domestic counter-revolutionaries in collusion with world reactionaries had been crushed by the international solidarity of the workers.

　　Kish went on to say that communists will never abandon their ideas. What the counter-revolutionaries were unhappy about was that they were unable to destroy the friendship between our two peoples. Today, new bonds link our friendship together, and this friendship will be unbreakable.

　　The participants in the evening then observed a minute of silence for the Csepel workers and Soviet soldiers who heroically sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the counter-revolutionaries.

　　Subsequently, steelworker Hirsh delivered a speech of gratitude on behalf of the Csepel workers to the Soviet officers and soldiers attending the evening. Soviet Private Loshev delivered a reply. A grand performance was held at the evening, with the participation of the song and dance ensemble of the Soviet army and a group of Moscow artists who were visiting Hungary.
