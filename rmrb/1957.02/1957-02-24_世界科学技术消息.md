    "The Wonders of Nature"
    Not long ago, an orchard appeared in Sochi, USSR - an asexually propagated pear orchard. The pear trees in this orchard will bear fruit twice a year, the first time on the ovaries of the flowers; and the second time, two or three weeks later, in the leaves that have not yet unfolded. This interesting biological phenomenon has not yet been scientifically explained and is called "The Wonders of Nature". This orchard was propagated by Soviet scientist Zorin using a new method he discovered.
    Now, Zorin has received many letters requesting information about the new method of propagating this rare plant. Some branches of this plant have been sent to French scientists.
    Experiment on Using Resin to Resist Radioactive Damage
    Professors Mérie and Michon of the French Atomic Energy Commission recently said in a report to the French Academy of Sciences that they have discovered that some resinous substances can effectively protect the human body from radioactive elements.
    In their experiments, they fed a group of mice a particularly dangerous radioactive element - strontium. Then, they allowed some of the mice to absorb a certain resin. After a period of time, it was found that a considerable amount of strontium in the bodies of those mice that absorbed the resin had been eliminated, while in the bodies of other mice, the radioactive element had invaded the bones.
    Hardening Tires with Nuclear Energy
    American scientists recently succeeded for the first time in using nuclear energy to harden rubber tires for automobiles. Using this method, tires can be hardened without heating, sulfur, or other substances, which greatly speeds up the production of tires, and the tires produced are more durable than those hardened by ordinary methods.
    Since 1839, the hardening of American rubber tires has been done by sulfurization.

    世界科学技术消息
    “自然的奥妙”
    在不久以前，苏联索契出现了一座果园——无性生殖梨果园。在这座果园里的梨树每年将结两次果实，第一次是在花的子房上结果；而第二次是两三个星期后在尚未张开的叶子中结果。这种有趣的生物现象至今还没有得到科学解释，被称为“自然的奥妙”。这个果园是苏联科学家佐林用他自己发现的新方法繁殖起来的。
    现在，佐林已经收到了很多要求告知繁殖这种稀有植物的新方法的信。这种植物的一些枝条已经寄给法国科学家。
    用树脂抗御放射性侵害的试验
    法国原子能委员会的梅里和米仲教授最近在给法国科学院的一个报告中说，他们已经发现有一些树脂物质可以有效地保护人体免受放射性元素的侵害。
    他们在实验中给一批老鼠服食了一种特别危险的放射性元素——锶。然后让其中部分老鼠吸收某种树脂，隔了一些时间，发现那些吸收了树脂的老鼠体内相当多的锶已经消灭，而在其它老鼠身体中，放射性元素却侵入了骨头。
    用核子能硬化轮胎
    美国的科学家不久前第一次成功地利用核子能来硬化汽车用的橡皮轮胎。使用这种办法，轮胎可以不用加热，也不用加硫和其他物质就可以得到硬化，这样就大大加快了轮胎的生产速度，而且生产的轮胎比用普通方法硬化的轮胎要耐用。
    从1839年以来，美国橡皮轮胎的硬化一直是用加硫的办法来进行的。
