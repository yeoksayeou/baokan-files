    The world's first International Puppet Theater Convention will be held in Bucharest next spring. Actors, puppet makers, and theater leaders from national and private theaters in many countries will be invited to participate in this grand event. Excellent scripts, outstanding collective and individual performances will be awarded prizes by the convention.
    Puppet theater is a popular art form among the masses, especially children, in Romania. There are now twenty national puppet theaters and dozens of amateur puppet troupes in Romania. Every year, almost two million children across the country watch puppet shows.
