Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, 8th -- TASS reports: The Soviet Embassy in Israel issued a note to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 6th, pointing out that the contract signed between the Soviet foreign trade organization and Israeli companies regarding the supply of crude oil, heavy oil, and oil pipes to Israel has been cancelled due to Israel's act of aggression against Egypt, which made it impossible to execute these contracts.

    The note stated that the Soviet Union had already stated in its statement issued on October 31, 1956, that the consequences arising from the aggression against Egypt should be entirely borne by the government that launched the aggression.

    The note pointed out: "It is completely unfounded for the Israeli government to try to attribute the responsibility for canceling the above-mentioned contracts to the Soviet Union."

    The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a note to the Soviet Embassy in Israel on December 28, 1956, attributing the responsibility for canceling the aforementioned contracts to the Soviet government.

    由于以色列侵略埃及
    苏联取消供应原油合同
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫讯：苏联驻以色列大使馆6日向以色列外交部发出照会，指出苏联对外贸易机构同以色列公司签订的关于供给以色列原油、重油和油管的合同被取消，是由于以色列对埃及的侵略行为使这些合同无法执行。
    这项照会说，苏联在1956年10月31日所发表的声明中已经说过，侵埃行为所引起的后果完全应该由发动侵略的政府全部负责。
    照会指出：“以色列政府想把取消上述合同的责任归咎于苏联是完全没有根据的。”
    以色列外交部曾经在1956年12月28日向苏联驻以色列大使馆发出一项照会，把取消上述合同的责任归之于苏联政府。
