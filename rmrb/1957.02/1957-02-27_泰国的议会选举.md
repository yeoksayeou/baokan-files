Thailand's parliamentary elections are being held across the country today. This is the second parliamentary election held since the Phibun regime launched a coup in November 1951 and consolidated its rule.

According to the new constitution promulgated by the Phibun regime after seizing power, Thailand's parliament adopts a unicameral system. The parliament has a total of 246 members, half of whom are directly elected first-category members, with a five-year term, and the other half are second-category members nominated by the cabinet and appointed by the King. The current 123 first-category members of parliament were produced in the election held on February 26, 1952.

The election of February 26, 1952, was held in a political atmosphere of dictatorial rule after the Phibun group launched a coup. At that time, many Thai political parties outside the executive group were not legally protected; freedom of speech in newspapers was strictly controlled, and opposition parties dared not criticize government policies; many political party members dared not come forward to participate in the election. In this election, only more than 420 candidates competed for the 123 first-category members of parliament. As a result of the election, the Phibun group won the vast majority of seats.

Currently, in the Thai parliament, Phibun's Seri Manangkhasila Party holds 100 seats among the first-category members, the Liberal Democratic Party holds 11 seats, the Democratic Party holds 6 seats, the Economist Party holds 3 seats, and other parties hold the remaining 3 seats; at the same time, the Seri Manangkhasila Party holds all the seats of the second-category members. In this way, the Seri Manangkhasila Party and its predecessor, the United Party, have firmly controlled the Thai parliament for several years. All opposition parties were established or restored only after the implementation of the law allowing the organization of political parties in September 1955.

According to the current Thai constitution, the number of first-category members of the Thai parliament will increase with the increase in the number of people nationwide who have received primary education, and the number of second-category members will decrease accordingly. In today's election, 9,892,700 voters, accounting for 43.3% of the Thai population, will elect 160 first-category members.

According to the latest announcement by the Thai Ministry of Interior, there are currently more than 960 candidates competing in 71 provinces in Thailand. They belong to thirteen political parties. Among them, the most powerful are the Seri Manangkhasila Party, the Democratic Party, and the Socialist United Front.

The ruling Seri Manangkhasila Party has dispatched more than 200 candidates in this election and has decided that nine cabinet members, including Phibun, will participate in the highly competitive election in the Bangkok constituency. The Seri Manangkhasila Party supports the Manila Military Treaty Organization and advocates accepting US "aid." It made full use of the convenient conditions of the ruling party in the election and tried its best to publicize its governance measures and promises to improve people's livelihoods and develop education.

The Democratic Party, led by former Prime Minister Nai Khuang Aphaiwong, strongly attacked the ruling party's policies for bringing increasingly impoverished conditions to the Thai people. However, the Democratic Party does not have major policy differences with the ruling party, nor has it put forward any more complete political program.

The various parties of the Socialist United Front (Economist Party, Socialist Party, Social Democratic Party, and Hyde Park Movement Party) have emerged as a new force in the election campaign, which is a feature not seen in past elections. They have proposed striving for Thailand's complete independence, opposing Thailand's participation in the Manila Treaty Organization, maintaining friendly relations with all countries, defending peace, and abolishing the "embargo" on China. Advocating for genuine democracy in domestic life and the improvement of people's lives has gained a positive response among voters.

Many pro-government newspapers in Thailand believe that the Seri Manangkhasila Party, which has been in power for eight years, will win a majority in this election and continue to govern. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 泰国的议会选举

    泰国的议会选举
    泰国的议会选举今天在全国各地举行。这是銮披汶集团在1951年11月发动政变并且巩固了它的统治地位以来举行的第二次议会选举。
    根据銮披汶集团在夺取政权以后颁布的新宪法，泰国的议会采取一院制。议会中共有二百四十六名议员，其中一半是民选的第一类议员，任期五年，另一半是内阁提名而由国王委任的第二类议员。目前议会中的一百二十三名第一类议员是在1952年2月26日举行的选举中产生的。
    1952年2月26日的选举是在銮披汶集团发动政变以后厉行独裁统治的政治气氛中举行的。当时，执行集团以外的许多泰国政党得不到法律的保障；报纸的言论受到严格的控制，反对党不敢批评政府的政策；许多政党人士不敢出面参加竞选。在这次选举中，只有四百二十多名候选人竞选议会中的一百二十三名第一类议员。选举结果，銮披汶集团获得了绝大部分议席。
    目前，在泰国议会中，銮披汶的玛兰卡西拉自由党占有第一类议员中的一百个席位，自由民主党占十一席，民主党占六席，经济人党占三席，另外三席为其他党派所占有；同时，玛兰卡西拉自由党占有了第二类议员的全部席位。这样，玛兰卡西拉自由党和它的前身联合党几年来一直牢牢地控制着泰国议会。而所有的反对党都是在1955年9月准许组织政党的法令实行以后才建立或者恢复起来的。
    根据泰国现行宪法的规定，泰国议会中的第一类议员的数目将随着全国受过小学教育人数的增加而增加，第二类议员的数目则将相应逐渐减少。在今天举行的选举中，占泰国人口43.3％的九百八十九万二千七百个选民将要选出一百六十名第一类议员。
    据泰国内政部最近公布，目前在泰国七十一个府参加竞选的候选人共有九百六十多人。他们分别属于十三个政党。其中，势力最大的是玛兰卡西拉自由党、民主党和社会主义联合阵线。
    执政的玛兰卡西拉自由党在这次竞选中派出了二百多名候选人，并且决定包括銮披汶在内的九名内阁成员参加竞争最激烈的京畿府的竞选。玛兰卡西拉自由党支持马尼拉军事条约组织，主张接受美“援”。它在竞选中充分利用执政党的方便条件，并且竭力宣扬它的施政措施以及改善民生和发展教育事业的诺言。
    以前总理乃宽·亚派旺为首的民主党极力攻击执政党的政策给泰国人民带来日益穷困的处境。但是民主党同执政党并没有重大政策分歧，它也没有提出任何较为完整的政纲。
    社会主义联合阵线各党（经济人党、社会党、社会民主党和海德公园运动党）以新兴力量的姿态在竞选运动中出现，这是过去选举中所没有的特点。它们提出的争取泰国的完全独立、反对泰国参加马尼拉条约组织、同各国友好、保卫和平、取消对中国的“禁运”。争取国内生活的真正民主和人民生活的改善的主张，已经在选民中获得积极的反响。
    泰国许多亲政府的报纸认为，已经执政八年的玛兰卡西拉自由党将会在这次选举中获得多数而继续执政。　（新华社）
