Responsible Cadres Visit Agricultural Cooperative
		Huang Miao

	Fresh snow has just cleared. Ancient Jinan awakens from the crisp sound of firecrackers.

	In Beiyuan Village – Liujiaqiao, surrounded by lotus ponds and rice paddies, beside Daming Lake – everywhere is filled with joy. Today, villagers are not only happy about the vigorous growth of vegetables in their greenhouses and last year's bumper harvest, but even more so that on this traditional ancient festival – the Spring Festival – Zhao Jianmin, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Shandong Province, Liu Naidian, Mayor of Jinan, and others, braving the severe cold and treading on the newly thawed ice, have come to visit them.

	Li Jieqing, a simple and honest young farmer, deputy director of the Leyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative. He was recently elected as a representative to the Second Jinan Municipal People's Congress. With a beaming smile, he welcomes the guests, representing the members to thank them for their congratulations and greetings. He tells the guests that in 1956, after the final distribution of the cooperative's income, it was clear that 85 out of 100 member families had increased their income compared to previous years, with an average of 114 yuan per member. This would have been impossible when working individually. Now, the members have already received more than 260,000 yuan in cash. If the vegetables in the cellars and greenhouses are sold, the members can earn more than 20,000 yuan more.

	"What are the members' requests?" Governor Zhao asks.

	Li Jieqing smiles before answering, "We hope that cadres will consult with everyone more often on matters." Then, with both regret and complaint, he recounts an unpleasant event. Last winter, when representatives of the Shandong Provincial People's Congress came here to inspect, the members raised many criticisms about the cadres' stubbornness and unwillingness to consult with the masses, but some cadres have since become less active... "Everything should be discussed with everyone. Old farmers have farmed the land for a lifetime and have experience, so we should consult them more often. Of course, we lacked experience when the cooperatives were first established, and it was really unavoidable to make some mistakes in our work at the beginning."

	When the guests ask about the cooperative's care for the "five guarantees" households, Li Jieqing says, "The cooperative provides each person with seven yuan per month for living expenses. Those who are old and unable to move have dedicated people to take care of them, and they don't have to worry about things like mending clothes."

	Li Jieqing's answers are full of substance and analysis, every sentence simple and honest. The guests express their satisfaction, nodding and praising him, and everyone present beams with joy.

	The guests ask what difficulties the cooperative faces this year.

	"The biggest difficulty is that it's hard to please everyone – the cooperative's expenses are tight, and some members don't understand..." When talking about this issue, Li Jieqing is visibly embarrassed.

	When Mayor Liu Naidian hears about these difficulties, he earnestly says, "To be honest, starting a family and a career always involves difficulties. As long as you tell everyone about all the difficulties, discuss them with everyone, and run the cooperative thriftily, manage your household thriftily, the difficulties will be overcome."

	Li Jieqing feels that the mayor's advice is pertinent and kind. He believes that the mayor is speaking from the heart, and for him, "this is a source of strength."

	The guests visit the homes of all the martyrs' families, military families, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in Liujiaqiao Village. They greet them and ask if their lives are getting better year by year.

	In the home of martyr Wang Fengqin, calligraphy, paintings, and plaques are displayed everywhere. When the guests ask about his family's living conditions, he says: His eldest son sacrificed himself in the Huaihai Campaign, serving the country loyally, which is a great honor. As for living conditions, with the care of the government and the cooperative, there are no difficulties.

	Unfortunately, when the guests arrive at the home of former Red Army soldier Li Ren, he has already gone to the city to attend a reception. He lives in three beautiful tile-roofed houses, and the interior furnishings are very simple. Perhaps because he is very nostalgic for his past life as a Red Army soldier, the walls are hung with a four-panel screen of stills from the drama "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains." His wife and children are dressed neatly and beautifully, listening to songs by the radio. She thanks the Party and the government for their concern for her family, and says that the government does not need to worry about her family's life.

	When the guests come out of the home of military family member Aunt Liu, her heart is filled with joy, and she keeps muttering that she must write a letter to her daughter and son to tell them that the governor and mayor came to wish her a happy New Year, and tell them to work and study hard!

    负责干部到农业社里作客	荒苗
    瑞雪乍晴。古老的济南从清脆的爆竹声中醒来。
    在大明湖畔，为藕池、稻田环绕着的北园农村——刘家桥，到处喜气洋洋。今天，村民不光是高兴他们的温室里的蔬菜生长得旺盛、去年的丰收，更高兴在这传统的古老节日——春节里，中共山东省委书记处书记、山东省省长赵健民，济南市市长刘乃殿等人，冒着严寒，踏着初融的冰冻，到他们这里作客来了。
    李杰清，一位淳朴的青年农民，乐园农业生产合作社副主任。他在不久前当选为济南市第二届人民代表大会代表。他笑容可掬地迎接着客人，代表社员感谢客人们的祝贺和问候。他告诉客人，在1956年，全社收入经过决分表明：一百家社员，有八十五家比往年增加了收入，每个社员平均是一百一十四元。而这些，在单干时是办不到的。现在，社员已经分到现金二十六万多元。假如把窖子和温室里的蔬菜出卖了，社员们还能收入两万多元。
    “社员们有什么要求？”赵省长问。
    李杰清先笑了笑，答道：“希望干部有事儿多跟大家商量。”接着又是惋惜又是埋怨地叙述了一件不愉快的事情。去年冬季，山东省人民代表大会代表到这里视察的时候，社员对社干部的固执己见、不善于同群众商量提出了许多批评，然而有的干部从此就不大积极了……。“凡事要和大家商量着办。老农民种了一辈子地，有经验，应当多请教他们。当然，过去没办过社，缺少经验，工作里出些差错，起初也实在难免。”
    客人问到社里照顾五保户的情形时，李杰清说：“每人每月由社里供给七元钱生活费，年纪大了不能行动的，有专人伺候，像补补缝缝，也不用他们操心。”
    李杰清的回答，有材料、有分析，句句是朴实的。客人们表示满意，不住地点头称赞，在座的人莫不笑逐颜开。
    客人问社里今年有什么困难？
    “最大的困难是，一人难服十人心——社里的开支紧张，有些社员不谅解……”谈到这个问题时，李杰清显然有点为难了。
    刘乃殿市长听到社里这些困难时就恳切地说：“说实在的，成家立业就是有困难。只要把困难都全盘告诉大家，和大家商量，勤俭办社，勤俭治家，困难自会克服。”
    李杰清对市长的嘱咐，感到中肯，亲切。他认为，市长向他说出心里话，对他来说，“这就是一股力量”。
    客人们到了刘家桥村所有的烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人的家里。向他们问好，问他们的生活是不是一年胜似一年。
    烈属王凤勤的家里，字画、匾额，琳琅满目。客人问他家的生活状况，他说：大儿子在淮海战役中牺牲了，为国尽忠，这是很大的光荣。说到生活，有政府和社里照顾，也没有什么困难。
    很不凑巧，当客人来到过去的红军战士李仁的家里时，他已经到市内参加招待会去了。他住着三间漂亮的瓦房，室内陈设很朴素。大概是由于十分留恋过去的红军生活的缘故，墙上挂着“万水千山”剧照四页屏。他的妻子和小孩，都穿得整洁，漂亮，正在收音机旁听着歌曲。她感谢党和政府对她一家的关怀，并说：政府对于她家的生活，可以不必惦念。
    当客人从军属刘大娘家里走出来时，她老人家心里喜得开了花，不住地叨念着说，一定要把省长、市长来给她拜年的事情，写信告诉女儿和儿子，叫他俩好好地工作和学习！
