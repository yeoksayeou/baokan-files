More Than 300 Ethnic Historical Relics

The Xinjiang Ethnic Social History Investigation Group has collected more than 300 ethnic historical relics in the Hotan area. Among them are books, contracts, and decrees in Uyghur, Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian languages dating from the 1580s to the 1930s. Some of these books are manuscripts by scholars of various ethnic minorities, recording ethnic history, religion, folk legends, and ethnic struggles. The manuscript of the Uyghur folk historian Mullah Musa Sayrami, written more than 50 years ago, records the atrocities of the ruling class in southern Xinjiang over the centuries and the heroic struggles of the Uyghur people, and its content is particularly rich.

In addition to collecting ethnic historical relics, the investigation group focused on investigating the class relations and the development of agriculture, handicrafts, culture, religion, and commerce in the local rural areas over the past century in the counties under the Hotan Special District, and also drew diagrams of some old agricultural tools and handicraft tools.

Hotan (originally called Yutian) had a relatively developed economy and culture in ancient times, and it had been an important passage for trade between Europe and Asia for a long time. However, due to repeated wars and the destruction by the ruling classes of past dynasties, many old historical documents have been lost. This investigation and the collected cultural relics are of great reference value for studying the history of Xinjiang and the social nature of the Uyghur people before liberation.

    三百多件民族历史文物
    新疆民族社会历史调查组在和阗一带搜集到三百多件民族历史文物。其中有十六世纪八十年代到二十世纪三十年代的维吾尔文、阿拉伯文、波斯文、土耳其文、印度文等的书籍、契约和法令等。在这些书籍中，有一些是各少数民族学者的手稿，记载着民族历史、宗教、民间传说和民族斗争史等。维吾尔族民间历史学家毛拉木沙·赛热米，五十多年前写的南疆几百年来统治阶级的暴行和维吾尔族人民英勇斗争事迹的手稿，内容特别丰富。
    调查组在和阗专区所属各县，除搜集民族历史文物外，还着重调查了近百年来当地农村的阶级关系和农业、手工业、文化、宗教、商业等方面的发展状况，并且绘制了从前一些农具和手工业工具的图。
    和阗（最早称于阗）在很早以前，经济和文化就比较发达，在很长的年代里一直是欧亚往来的要道。但是由于历史上多次的战乱以及历代统治阶级的毁坏，旧有的历史文献多已散失。这次的调查和所搜集的文物，对研究新疆的历史和解放前维吾尔族的社会性质，都有很大参考价值。
