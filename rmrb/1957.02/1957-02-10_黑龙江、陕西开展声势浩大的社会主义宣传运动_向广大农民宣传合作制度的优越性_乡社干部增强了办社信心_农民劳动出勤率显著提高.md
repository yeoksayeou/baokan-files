    Heilongjiang and Shaanxi Launch Vigorous Socialist Propaganda Campaign
    Promoting the Superiority of the Cooperative System to the Broad Masses of Farmers
    Township and Commune Cadres Strengthened Their Confidence in Running the Cooperatives; Farmers' Labor Attendance Rate Significantly Increased
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) A socialist propaganda campaign centered on the superiority of agricultural cooperation is being launched gradually and vigorously in the vast rural areas of Heilongjiang Province. Since the Provincial Party Committee issued a notice to widely carry out this propaganda campaign around the Spring Festival, the various prefectural and county party committees have successively convened meetings, put forward specific measures and requirements, and formulated propaganda plans. The Mudanjiang Prefectural Party Committee held a telephone conference attended by county party secretaries, county party committee members, bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and other cadres, requiring the entire district to organize a propaganda force of 150,000 people, including party members, League members, cadres, and propagandists, around the Spring Festival to conduct in-depth socialist ideological education for the broad masses of farmers using various forms of propaganda that the masses love to see and hear. The Prefectural Party Committee required the county party secretaries and county party committee members to personally give reports to the masses, mobilize the entire party, and do a good job in this propaganda with high political enthusiasm. According to preliminary statistics from the Hejiang area, in just five counties of Huachuan, Jixian, Tangyuan, Boli, and Fujin, 172 county-level responsible cadres, including secretaries, members, ministers, county heads, bureau chiefs, and section chiefs, and 631 township chiefs and general branch secretaries, were dispatched to make 1,685 reports to farmers. While organizing responsible cadres to make reports to farmers, the various prefectural and county party committees also organized a large number of propaganda backbone personnel, including county, township, and commune cadres, party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and model cooperative members. The Mudanjiang and Hejiang special districts alone organized more than 230,000 propaganda troops. This huge propaganda force went deep into various agricultural cooperatives and conducted propaganda to farmers by team, group, and household.
    According to preliminary statistics from five counties, including Huachuan and Boli, 470,000 farmers have received varying degrees of education, accounting for 70% of the total number of farmers in these five counties.
    In this propaganda campaign, everyone paid attention to using the method of summing up the superiority of cooperation and conducting recollection and comparison to enlighten the masses through real people and real events. At the same time, various propaganda forces were organized, and the propaganda methods were diverse. In the Hejiang area, 672 drama troupes have begun performing programs related to the content of cooperation, 917 local opera artists have participated in propaganda activities, and 2,237 newspaper readers and 51 storytellers have also become active members of the propaganda. Blackboards, radio broadcasts, slides, picture exhibitions, and other forms of propaganda that the masses love to see and hear have all been utilized. Propaganda stations have also been set up in hotels, restaurants, inns, and some mass gathering places to carry out in-depth and heartfelt propaganda activities to the broad masses.
    According to the reflections of several regions and some counties, this propaganda campaign has achieved preliminary results. The broad masses of cadres and the masses have strengthened their confidence in running the cooperatives; some township and commune cadres have dispelled the idea of changing shifts, and they have correctly recognized the achievements and problems of running advanced cooperatives for a year, and are actively leading the members to invest in production and various tasks. After carrying out the propaganda campaign, the labor attendance rate of the Xinsheng Cooperative in Tangyuan County increased from 70% to more than 90%. The number of carts transporting public grain and purchasing grain in Fujin County has surged. On the 25th of last month, only a few hundred carts were delivering grain every day, but now there are more than 1,800 carts every day. Many farmers have reflected: "The road we took was not wrong, it is a bright road." After hearing the propaganda, some farmers in Xiangyang Township, Tangyuan County, who originally wanted to move and withdraw from the cooperative, no longer move or withdraw, and some individual farmers have also joined the cooperative.

    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) According to a report in the Shaanxi Daily: Recently, Shaanxi Province's rural areas have launched a vigorous political propaganda campaign, and this movement is gradually deepening.
    Before the Spring Festival, propaganda personnel from various places had already begun to go deep into the countryside to carry out propaganda activities. Propagandists from more than 40 counties and cities in the Guanzhong area and various counties in the Yulin and Ankang special districts have successively gone deep into the countryside to carry out propaganda and education among the masses of farmers. Propagandists from 16 counties, including Yan'an, Huanglong, Zichang, and Fengxian and Nanzheng in the Hanzhong special district, are beginning to publicize the international situation and the superiority of advanced cooperatives to the masses. Mian County organized a report group to make systematic roving reports in points and townships, and at the same time, organized representative figures to publicize the benefits of cooperation in a way that speaks from personal experience. Among the nearly one million propagandists organized throughout the province, many are heads of party and government organs at all levels and cadres with a high level of theoretical understanding and practical work experience.
    Various localities have made full preparations before launching in-depth propaganda. The content of propaganda in various localities is determined based on the specific conditions and characteristics of the locality. In addition to publicizing the superiority of advanced cooperatives to the masses, propagandists in many counties in the Yan'an special district will also educate farmers on continuing to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the old revolutionary base areas and maintaining a hard-working and simple style. Nanzheng County will publicize the superiority of advanced cooperatives to farmers by exhibiting pictures and objects that demonstrate the achievements of the county's agricultural production increase in 1956. Weinan County conducts "four comparisons" education for members and cooperative cadres by summarizing the facts of increased production and income in various districts, townships, and cooperatives in 1956, that is, comparing increased production, comparing the superiority of advanced cooperatives, comparing patriotism, and comparing the unity of cooperative cadres and members. At the same time, they also educate cooperative cadres and members on running cooperatives democratically.
    Shaanxi Province's large-scale political and ideological propaganda and education work for the masses of farmers began in mid-January this year and will last for one month. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all localities to further enlighten and enhance the political and ideological awareness of the masses of farmers and improve their enthusiasm for production through this large-scale propaganda and education work.

    乡社干部增强了办社信心　农民劳动出勤率显著提高
    本报讯　以农业合作化优越性为中心的社会主义宣传运动，正在黑龙江省广大农村逐步地大张旗鼓地开展起来。自省委发出在春节前后广泛开展这一宣传运动的通知以后，各个地委和县委都先后召开会议，提出具体的措施和要求，制定出宣传计划。中共牡丹江地委召开了有县委书记、县委委员、局长、科长等干部参加的电话会议，要求全区在春节前后，组织有党员、团员、干部、宣传员等参加的十五万人的宣传大军，用群众喜闻乐见的各种宣传形式，向广大农民进行深入的社会主义思想教育。地委要求县委书记和县委委员要亲自向群众作报告，全党动手，以高度的政治热情，做好这次宣传。据合江地区初步统计，仅桦川、集贤、汤原、勃利、富锦五个县，就出动了包括有书记、委员、部长、县长、局长、科长等一百七十二名县级负责干部，六百三十一名乡长、总支书记，向农民作了一千六百八十五次报告。各地、县委在组织负责干部向农民作报告的同时，还组织了包括有县、乡、社干部、党员、青年团员、宣传员、模范社员、民间艺人等大批的宣传骨干。牡丹江、合江两个专区就组织了二十三万多名宣传大军。这一巨大的宣传队伍，分别深入到各农业社，按队、按组、按户地向农民进行了宣传。
    据桦川、勃利等五个县的初步统计，已有四十七万农民受到了程度不同的教育，占这五个县农民总数的70％。
    在这次宣传运动中，大家都重视运用总结合作化的优越性，进行回忆对比，通过真人真事启发群众的教育方法。同时，各种宣传力量都组织起来，宣传方式也多式多样。合江地区已有六百七十二个剧团，开始演出有关合作化内容的节目，有九百一十七名唱地方剧的艺人，参加了宣传活动，二千二百三十七名读报员和五十一名说书的人，也成为宣传中的活动分子。黑板报、广播、幻灯、图片展览等群众喜闻乐见的各种宣传形式都利用了。旅馆、饭店、大车店以及一些群众集会的场所，还设立了宣传站，向广大群众进行深入人心的宣传活动。
    根据几个地区和一些县的反映，这次宣传运动已经收到了初步的效果。广大干部和群众已增强了办社信心；有些乡、社干部打消了换班的思想，他们正确地认识了办高级社一年来的成绩和问题，正在积极地领导社员投入生产和各项工作。汤原县新胜社在开展宣传运动以后，劳动出勤率由以前的70％提高到90％以上。富锦县运送公粮和购粮的大车数激增，上月25日每天只有几百辆车送粮，现在每天有一千八百多辆车。许多农民反映：原来我们走的这条道没有错，是一条光明的大道。汤原县向阳乡农民听到宣传以后，有些原来要搬家退社的，现在也不搬家，不退社了，有一些单干农民也加入了合作社。

    本报讯　据陕西日报报道：最近，陕西省农村已经展开声势浩大的政治宣传，这个运动正在逐步深入。
    在春节前，各地宣传人员已开始深入农村进行宣传活动。关中地区四十多县、市和榆林、安康等专区各县的宣传员已陆续深入农村，向农民群众进行宣传教育。延安、黄龙、子长和汉中专区的凤县、南郑等十六县的宣传员正在开始向群众宣传国际形势和高级社优越性。沔县组织了报告团，分点包乡作系统的巡回报告，同时以社为单位，组织有代表性的人物，用现身说法的办法宣传合作化的好处。全省组织的近百万名宣传员，其中有许多是各地党、政机关的负责人和理论水平较高，而且有实际工作经验的干部。
    各地在深入展开宣传以前都作了充分的准备工作。各地宣传的内容都是根据当地具体情况和特点决定的。延安专区许多县的宣传员除向群众宣传高级社的优越性外，还将向农民进行有关继续发扬老革命根据地的革命传统和保持艰苦朴素作风的教育。南郑县将通过展览1956年全县农业增产成绩的图片和实物，向农民宣传高级社的优越性。渭南县通过总结各区、乡、社1956年增产和增加收入的事实，向社员和社干部进行“四比”教育，即比增产、比高级社的优越性、比爱国和社干部同社员的团结，同时还向社干部和社员进行民主办社的教育。
    陕西省大规模向农民群众开展政治思想宣传教育工作，从今年1月中旬开始，将进行一个月的时间。中共陕西省委要求各地通过这次大规模的宣传教育工作，进一步启发和增强农民群众的政治思想觉悟，提高生产积极性。
