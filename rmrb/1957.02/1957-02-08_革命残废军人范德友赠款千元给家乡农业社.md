Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 7th. Revolutionary disabled veteran Fan Deyou, who has been bedridden for more than nine years, recently sent one thousand yuan to the editorial department of the Sichuan Daily, asking them to forward it to the agricultural cooperative in his hometown—the Feijin Agricultural Cooperative in Dongyue Township, Daxian County, Sichuan Province—as a Spring Festival gift. This money is part of the production subsidy provided to Fan Deyou by the state, as well as the savings he has accumulated from his living expenses over the years.

Fan Deyou is a veteran revolutionary who participated in the Long March. In 1933, at the age of fifteen, he joined the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. He was wounded many times during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. In 1947, during the Ping-Han Campaign, he was seriously wounded and became paralyzed on one side of his body, and has been bedridden ever since for more than nine years. During these years, although he has no relatives left in his family, he still corresponds with the people in his hometown frequently. Recently, he learned that the income of the Feijin Agricultural Cooperative in his hometown increased by more than 20% last year, and that they are now engaged in land improvement, striving to become an advanced cooperative this year. He was extremely excited and wanted to return to his hometown immediately to farm with the peasants, but unfortunately, he could not move. Seeing that the spring plowing was about to begin, he donated this thousand yuan to the Feijin Agricultural Cooperative, and attached a letter hoping that they would use the money in production in the spirit of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. He also hoped that the agricultural cooperative would overfulfill its production increase plan this year and actively support national construction.

    革命残废军人范德友
    赠款千元给家乡农业社
    新华社成都7日电　在病床上躺了九年多的革命残废军人范德友，最近寄一千元给四川日报编辑部，请他们转赠给他家乡的农业社——四川省达县东岳乡飞进农业社，作为春节的礼物。这笔钱是国家发给范德友的生产资助金和他历年节约生活费用的积蓄中的一部分。
    范德友是一位参加过长征的革命老战士。1933年他十五岁时就参加了工农红军。在抗日战争和解放战争时期曾多次负伤。1947年平汉战役时，他身负重伤，半身瘫痪，从那时以后一直在病床上躺了九年多。这些年中，虽然他的家里已经没有什么亲人，但他仍然和家乡的人们时常通信。最近他得知家乡飞进农业社去年的收入增加了20％以上，现在正搞土地加工，要争取今年转为高级社，他兴奋极了，想立刻回到家乡和农民们一起种地，怎奈自己不能活动。眼看春耕就要来了，他便拿这一千元赠给飞进农业社，并附信希望他们把这笔钱本着勤俭办社的精神，用到生产中去。他还希望这个农业社今年能超额完成增产计划，积极支援国家建设。
