The Aksu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is making early preparations for agricultural cooperatives to acquire Soviet-variety cotton seeds.

This year, the county plans to expand the planting area of Soviet-variety cotton by 50,000 mu, greatly increasing the need for Soviet-variety cotton seeds. The supply and marketing cooperative specifically brought in skilled workers from other counties to rush-produce sawtooth cotton gins. One unit is already in production, and once the other unit is completed, it is estimated that more than 6,000 jin of seed cotton can be ginned daily. These cotton seeds will be supplied to agricultural cooperatives in a timely manner.

After investigating the new needs of rural areas for means of production, the Miquan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative is vigorously organizing the supply of new-style agricultural implements such as seeders, cultivators, zigzag harrows, and land rollers, while also fully preparing old-fashioned agricultural implements. In terms of fertilizer supply, in addition to the Autonomous Region Supply and Marketing Cooperative assisting in the active establishment of a granular fertilizer processing plant and promoting the supply of some chemical fertilizers, it also plans to supply 200,000 jin of manure fertilizer to meet the production needs of farmers.

    阿克苏等县供销社及早准备春耕物资
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区阿克苏县供销社及早为农业社准备苏种棉籽。
    今年，全县计划扩大苏种棉播种面积五万亩，对苏种棉籽的需要量大大增加，供销社专门由外县调来了技术工人，赶制锯齿形的轧花机。现在已有一部投入生产，等另一部制成后，预计每天可轧籽棉六千多市斤。这些棉籽将及时供应给农业社。
    米泉县供销合作社在调查研究了农村对生产资料的新的需要以后，大力组织供应播种机、中耕器、之字耙、镇压器等新式农具，同时充分准备了旧式农具。在肥料供应方面，除由自治区供销社帮助积极建立颗粒肥料加工厂，推广供应一部分化学肥料以外，还计划供应二十万市斤粪肥，满足农民生产需要。
