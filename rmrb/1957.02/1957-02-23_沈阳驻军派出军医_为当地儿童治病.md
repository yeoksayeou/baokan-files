Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 22nd: The People's Liberation Army garrisoned in Shenyang has dispatched a group of military doctors to vigorously assist local people in preventing and treating measles and pneumonia in children.

Recently, measles and pneumonia have been prevalent among children in Shenyang City, and the local medical resources are insufficient. The leading organs of the Shenyang garrison troops have transferred a group of military doctors and nurses to form six prevention and treatment teams, which have gone deep into various streets to assist in the prevention and treatment work. The military doctors have been working around the clock to provide treatment to residents, and some have even been working on Sundays as usual. The thirteen military doctors working at the Nanshi District Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital have to travel more than ten li from their barracks to the hospital. They arrive half an hour early every day, and when there are many patients, they buy steamed buns or bread to fill their stomachs at noon.

The military doctors have already cured a large number of children. Their working spirit has been praised by local medical personnel.

    沈阳驻军派出军医
    为当地儿童治病
    据新华社沈阳22日电　中国人民解放军驻沈阳部队派出一批军医，大力协助当地人民防治小儿麻疹和肺炎。
    最近，沈阳市的儿童中流行麻疹和肺炎，当地的医疗力量不足。驻沈阳部队领导机关抽调了一批军医和护士组成六个防治组，深入各个街道协助防治工作。军医们夜以继日地在居民中巡回治疗，有的在星期日也照常工作。在南市区中西医院工作的十三名军医，从部队宿舍到医院要跑十多里路，他们每天都提前半小时上班，在病人多的时候中午就买一些馒头或面包充饥。
    军医们已经治愈了大批儿童。他们的工作精神受到当地医务人员的赞扬。
