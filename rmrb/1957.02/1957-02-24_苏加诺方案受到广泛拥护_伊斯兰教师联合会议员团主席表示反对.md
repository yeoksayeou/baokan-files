Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 23rd -- According to the "Indonesia News" report, President Sukarno received telegrams throughout the 22nd from many groups and individuals from all levels of Indonesian society, all expressing support for the President's plan.

The National Committee of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions stated in a telegram to Sukarno that the President's plan is the correct path to solving Indonesia's current difficulties. The plan's mention of establishing a mutual assistance cabinet encompassing all factions is the desire of Indonesian workers and people of all levels, because such a cabinet can guarantee national peace.

The National Committee of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions also issued a statement on the 22nd, calling on workers in various regions to participate in discussions of the President's plan and to actively participate in all activities expressing support for the President's plan.

The Indonesian Women's Movement Association also issued a statement on the 22nd, expressing full support for the President's plan. The statement said that due to the existence of imperialist conspiracies against Indonesia and the rebellious actions of Lubis, Simbolon, Husein, and others, all Indonesian people place their hopes on the President's plan.

The editorial of the "Social Messenger," the organ of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, stated on the 22nd that Sukarno's intention in proposing the plan seemed very good, but the methods of implementation are still difficult for Indonesian society to accept at present.

Asin, Chairman of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association's parliamentary delegation, expressed his opposition to Gano's plan in a statement on the 22nd. He believes that there are indications that the President's plan cannot be unanimously approved by the four major parties, nor can it be unanimously approved by religious parties.

    苏加诺方案受到广泛拥护
    伊斯兰教师联合会议员团主席表示反对
    新华社雅加达23日电　据“印度尼西亚新闻报”报道，苏加诺总统在22日整天接到了印度尼西亚各阶层许多团体和个人打来的电报，这些电报都表示支持总统的方案。
    全印度尼西亚工会中央组织全国委员会给苏加诺的电报说，总统方案是解决印度尼西亚目前困难的正确道路。方案提到要成立包罗各派别的互助内阁是印度尼西亚工人和各阶层人民的愿望，因为这样的内阁能够保障民族和平。
    全印度尼西亚工会中央组织全国委员会22日还发表了一个声明，号召各地工人参加讨论总统的方案，并且积极参加一切表示支持总统方案的活动。
    印度尼西亚妇女运动协会22日也发表声明，表示完全支持总统方案。声明说，由于存在着帝国主义对印度尼西亚的阴谋计划和卢比斯、西姆波朗、侯赛尼等人的叛乱行动，因此全体印度尼西亚人民把希望寄托于总统的方案。
    伊斯兰教师联合会的机关报“社会使者报”22日的社论说，苏加诺提出方案的用意看来的确很好，但是实行的方式方法在目前的印度尼西亚社会还很难接受。
    伊斯兰教师联合会国会议员团主席阿辛22日发表谈话表示反对加诺的方案。他认为，有迹象表明，总统的计划不能得到四个大党的一致赞同，也不能得到宗教党派的一致赞同。
