    Mongolian Proverbs
    Lose your horse by sleeping in,
    Break your knife trying to eat the marrow.
    A drunkard speaks his true thoughts,
    A child speaks what he has seen.
    If you can't find it in the day, look for it at night,
    If you can't finish it in the autumn, do it in the winter.
    Eyes to see others,
    No mirror to see oneself.
    Talent comes from poor families,
    The lotus blooms in dead mud.
    Like a fierce tiger to others,
    But like a hen sitting on eggs to oneself.
    How can those who build stoves and cook not get their hands dirty?
    How can those who go out and work alone not encounter difficulties?

    蒙古谚语
    因睡懒觉丢掉马匹，
    为吃骨髓损坏刀子。
    醉汉讲的是自己实想的，
    小孩说的是亲眼看见的。
    白天找不到黑夜找，
    秋天做不完冬天做。
    有眼睛看别人，
    无镜子照自己。
    人才出在贫寒家庭，
    莲花开在死水泥中。
    对别人犹如深山猛虎，
    对自己则像压蛋母鸡。
    抬锅搭灶的人那有手不染黑的，
    出门单干的人那有不遇困难的。	　王毓铭辑译
