Xinhua News Agency, Ismailia, 16th. An Egyptian Suez Canal Authority spokesman said on the 15th that it would still be some time before the Suez Canal could truly be used by light tonnage ships.

The spokesman said in Ismailia that the Italian oil tanker "Pionetta," which was originally scheduled to pass through the canal, had been ordered to return to Port Said "because technical reasons prevented it from continuing through the canal to the port of Suez."

Reports said that ships under 3,000 tons can now pass through the canal. The spokesman said that this may be true, but "this does not mean that the canal is immediately suitable for such ships to navigate."

    苏伊士运河还不能通航
    新华社16日讯　伊士美利亚消息：埃及苏伊士运河管理局的一位发言人15日说，苏伊士运河要真的能通行轻吨位的船只，还要过一些时候。
    这位发言人在伊士美利亚说，原来准备通过运河的意大利油船“皮昂内塔”号，已经奉命返回塞得港，“因为技术上的原因使它不能继续通过运河前往苏伊士港”。
    有消息说，三千吨以内的船只现在已经可以通过运河。这位发言人说，这也许是真的，但是，“这并不意味着这条运河立即适于这种船只航行”。
