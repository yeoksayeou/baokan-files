Xinhua News Agency, 6th: China's film industry achieved new successes in 1956.

    In 1956 alone, the total film audience reached over 1,397 million. If calculated based on 70% of the nation's 600 million population (excluding young children), each person could watch movies more than three times a year on average.

    All film studios directly under the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture completed or exceeded their annual plans in 1956. The studios collectively produced forty feature films. The range of subject matter was broader than before, including "Shangganling" depicting the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, "Railway Guerrilla" depicting the People's Revolutionary War, "Battle in the Desert" depicting the lives of geological exploration personnel, "For Peace" depicting the ideological changes of intellectuals, "The New Year Sacrifice" adapted from Lu Xun's novel, and "Family" adapted from Ba Jin's novel, the biographical film of the famous pharmacologist "Li Shizhen," the children's film "Brother and Sister," and documentaries of classical and local operas such as "Song Shijie," "Wild Goose on the Beach," "Fifteen Strings of Cash," "Searching the Academy," "A Mother Recognizes Her Son in a Nunnery," and satirical comedies such as "Before the New Director Arrives" and "People Who Don't Stand on Ceremony," etc. These films each had their own strengths in character development, artistic treatment, and the application of film techniques. In particular, "Shangganling" and "The New Year Sacrifice," which have already been released, have been warmly welcomed by audiences.

    The Shanghai Film Studio produced eight animated films (including animation and puppet films), achieving great success in art design and character creation. The animated film "The Proud General" has reached a considerably high level in terms of ideological content, artistry, and painting techniques.

    A total of eighty-nine newsreels were completed. They timely captured major domestic and international events and reflected our country's socialist construction and new life from various perspectives. Newsreel filmmakers also shot the short film "Conquering Muztagata," documenting Chinese and Soviet mountaineers conquering Muztagata Mountain, the color landscape documentary "Ode to the Yan River," and "The Summer Palace," reflecting the hard work of geological exploration personnel and oil exploitation in "In the Qaidam Basin" and "People Building Oil Bases," introducing the construction of the new port in the color film "Zhanjiang Port," introducing the South China Agricultural Exhibition in "The Prosperous Lingnan," and the "Travelogue of the Treasure Island" introducing the products and scenery of Hainan Island.

    A total of thirty-nine science education films were completed. These films are characterized by their rich variety and strict scientific accuracy, playing a considerable role in popularizing scientific knowledge and promoting new technologies.

    The studios also translated one hundred and eighteen foreign feature films.

    While completing their 1956 tasks, the studios also prepared for this year's production. Currently, the studios have basically completed the scripts for thirty-eight feature films to be shot in 1957. Some of these films will be released in the first quarter of this year. This year will also see the trial production of widescreen films.
