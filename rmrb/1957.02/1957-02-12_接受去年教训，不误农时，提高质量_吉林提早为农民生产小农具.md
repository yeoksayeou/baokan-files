    Learning from Last Year's Lessons, Not Missing the Farming Season, Improving Quality
    Jilin Starts Producing Small Farm Tools for Farmers Early

    (Our newspaper reports) Handicraft production cooperatives in Jilin Province are actively producing small farm tools for farmers to use in spring plowing. Learning from the lesson of last year's shortage of spring plowing tools, handicraft production cooperatives in various places have started producing small farm tools earlier this year. The Huadian County Iron Farm Tool Cooperative prepared for the production of spring plowing tools as early as December last year. It started producing hoes and grass sickles at the beginning of this year, and it is expected that all 5,000 hoes planned for production can be produced and delivered to farmers by the beginning of March. The Shuanghe Town Iron Farm Tool Handicraft Production Cooperative in Yongji County, based on the characteristics of vigorous development of paddy fields and multiple high-yield crops in the area, plans to produce 1,310 paddy field walking plows this year. It started producing parts in early December last year and is preparing to install 300 units in March for timely input into spring plowing production. In addition to the more than 630 manure digging hoes, more than 2,000 pointed hoes, and more than 200 dozen cylinder shovels that have already been produced, the Shulan Town Ironware Production Cooperative's blast furnace workshop plans to produce 30,000 double-wheeled double-shared plow parts by the end of the first quarter. The Baicheng County Weaving Cooperative is also actively producing manure baskets for spring plowing and has signed a contract with the county supply and marketing cooperative for 9,000 manure baskets, of which more than 1,700 have already been produced.

    Handicraft cooperatives in various places have paid attention to improving product quality. The Huadian Town Iron Farm Tool Production Cooperative held two technical research meetings before construction to conduct special research on the quality of farm tools to be produced this spring. The quality of the hoes and sickles they produced last year was not good, and farmers complained that they were "glass hoes" and "curling sickles." This year, new quality standards have been formulated to ensure that hoes achieve "thick rib, uniform bore, and sharp blade." Members of the Qianguo Town Ironware Production Cooperative in the Qianguo'erluosi Mongolian Autonomous County made a special trip to the countryside to visit farmers and improved the specifications and quality of scythes and hoe blades according to farmers' opinions. The quality of the more than 1,100 scythes and hoe blades that have been produced now is better than in the past.

    接受去年教训，不误农时，提高质量
    吉林提早为农民生产小农具
    本报讯　吉林省各地手工业生产合作社正积极为农民生产春耕用的小农具。各地手工业生产社接受去年春耕农具脱销的教训，今年都提前开始生产小农具。桦甸县铁农具社在去年12月就做好了今年春耕农具生产的准备工作，今年年初开始生产镐头和柴镰刀，预计在3月初可以把计划生产的五千把镐头全部生产出来送到农民手里。永吉县双河镇铁农具手工业生产合作社，根据当地大力开发水田、多种高产作物的特点，今年计划生产水田步犁一千三百一十台，从去年12月上旬就开始生产部件，准备在3月份安装出三百台及时投入春耕生产。舒兰镇铁业生产合作社烘炉车间除了已经生产出来六百三十多把刨粪的大镐，两千多把尖镐和二百多打筒锹以外，还计划到第一季度末生产出三万件双轮双铧犁另件。白城县编织社也积极生产春耕用的粪筐，和县供销社签订了九千个粪筐的合同，现在已经生产出来一千七百多个。
    各地手工业社注意了提高产品质量。桦甸镇铁农具生产合作社在施工以前，召开过两次技术研究会，对今春将要生产的农具质量作了专门研究，他们去年生产的镐头、镰刀质量不好，农民提意见说是“玻璃镐”、“卷刃镰”。今年制订了新的质量标准，使镐头达到“筋厚、膛匀、刃快”。前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县前郭镇铁器生产合作社的社员，特意下乡访问了农民，根据农民的意见改进了钐刀和锄板的规格质量，现在生产出来的一千一百多把钐刀、锄板的质量，都比过去的质量好。
