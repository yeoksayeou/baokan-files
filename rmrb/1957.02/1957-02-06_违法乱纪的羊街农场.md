    The Sheep Street Farm's Illegal and Disciplinary Violations
    We are writing with indignation to expose the consistent illegal and disciplinary violations and unreasonable behavior of the state-owned Sheep Street Farm in Yunnan Province over the past few years.

    The Sheep Street Farm is located in the Sheep Street Dam area, where water conservancy conditions are very poor. In the past, there was a saying: "You can have a hundred acres of land per family, but water is harder to get than meat broth." Since the establishment of the Sheep Street Farm in 1952, it has disregarded everything and infringed upon the interests of the masses. Not to mention the distant past, there are countless examples from 1956 alone. In April, farmers in Li Hai Village, in order to fight drought, used more than two hundred workdays to dig a "White Sand Pond" to store water, preparing to save more than eighty acres of fields. However, the farm, disregarding the farmers' opposition, sent sixty people to dig for half a day and also dug off the water source at the outlet. In May, when it rained, the agricultural cooperative built a dam to block water for rice planting, but it was dug up four times by the farm, resulting in the cooperative planting eighty fewer acres of rice. In the autumn, the Sheep Street Township Agricultural Cooperative closed off twenty-two ponds, and now seven ponds have been infringed upon by the farm. The Ma Wang Village pond suffered from the farm using the water, and farmers planted two hundred fewer acres of rice. In the autumn, the farmers filled the pond with water again, but the farm dug more than ten acres of vegetable fields next to the pond for planting; now it has used up water that could irrigate about one hundred acres of rice. When it is time to plant rice seedlings, the five hundred acres of fields irrigated by this pond may be abandoned again. When farmers offered them wells, they嫌远不要 [likely means "嫌远不要嫌弃太远不要 - they rejected it for being too far away"]. When farmers took the initiative to unite with them to build water conservancy facilities, they refused. Once, village cadres reasoned with them at length, and they barely agreed to send a few stonemasons when the culvert was built; but when the time came, they did not send a single worker. They have even beaten farmers for randomly taking water from the farmers' ponds without permission.

    They also often steal fertilizer from the agricultural cooperative, having taken more than 10,000 catties of fertilizer from Li Hai Village and more than 30,000 catties of grass fertilizer from Mu Tou Village. Fertilizer in the farmers' fields is sometimes also taken away by them. After the farm exchanged land with the farmers, boundary markers were planted; but the farm forcibly expanded again, occupying more than ten acres of the farmers' land and building houses on the farmers' land without their consent. Last April, when they wanted to build a clinic, the farmers agreed to give them a piece of land for the foundation, but not the stones from the dilapidated house on the foundation; as a result, they used up all of the villagers' stones.

    They often borrow things from the farmers and fail to return them for years, and some debts they simply deny.

    In order to facilitate continuous operation, they cut off three roads that farmers often used; and when they needed to pass through, they trampled on everything that the farmers had planted, creating several roads.

    In production, they do not implement state plans and conceal a large amount of output. Last year, the county needed peanut seeds, and they said it would be difficult to transfer 30,000 catties; but later they sold 150,000 catties of peanuts. The state assigned them a task of transferring 280 live pigs, but they only completed 45; it was not that they were unable to complete the task, but that they slaughtered a large number of fat pigs themselves. In addition, they also fail to pay taxes on time and refuse the tax bureau to inspect.

### 违法乱纪的羊街农场

    违法乱纪的羊街农场
    我们怀着愤懑的心情，来揭发云南省地方国营羊街农场几年来一贯违法乱纪、蛮横无理的现象。
    羊街农场设在羊街坝，这一带水利条件很差，过去曾流传着“要土地一家给你百亩都行，要水比要肉汤还难”的说法。羊街农场从1952年建场以来，不顾一切地侵犯群众利益。远的不说，单是1956年的事情就举不胜举。4月间李海寨的农民为了抗旱，用二百多个工挖了一个“白沙塘”来关水，准备救八十多亩田。但农场却不顾农民的反对，派了六十个人挑了半天，并在出水的地方把水头挖断。5月间下雨的时候，农业社筑坝堵水栽秧，被农场四次挖断，社里因此少栽了八十亩水稻。秋天羊街乡农业社关了二十二塘水，现在已有七个塘受到农场的侵犯。马王庄塘子因水被农场用掉，农民少栽了水稻二百亩。秋天农民又把水关满了，农场又在塘边挖了十多亩菜地栽起来；现在已用掉了大约可栽一百亩水稻的水，到栽秧的时候，靠这个塘子灌溉的五百亩田又可能要荒芜了。农民给他们井，他们嫌远不要。农民主动团结他们一起兴修水利，他们不干。有一次村干部和他们讲了很多道理，好容易才答应修涵洞的时候出几个石工；但到时候一个工也不出。曾经因为乱挑农民塘里的水，农民不允许，还殴打过农民。
    他们还经常偷挑农业社的肥料，曾把李海寨的肥料挑了一万多斤，把木头寨的草肥挑了三万多斤。农民田地里的肥料有时也被他们挑走。农场和农民交换土地以后，栽上了界桩；但农场又强行扩张，占了农民的十多亩地，不征得农民同意，就在农民的地上盖起了房子。去年4月，他们要盖医务室，农民答应给他们一块地基，但地基上烂房子的石头不给；结果他们却把人家的石头全部用光。
    他们借了农民的东西，常常是几年不还，有的就不认账了。
    他们为了便于连片经营，把农民常走的三条道路截断；而他们要过路的地方，不管农民栽了什么都乱踩一气，踩出几条路来。
    在生产上，他们不执行国家计划，并大量隐瞒产量。去年县里需要花生种子，他们说调三万斤有困难；但后来他们却出卖了十五万斤花生米。国家分配给他们二百八十头生猪上调任务，只完成了四十五头；并不是他们没有能力完成，而是把大量的肥猪自己宰了。此外，他们还不按期交纳税款，并拒绝税务局去检查。　李家璋、阳　明
