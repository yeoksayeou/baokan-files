Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 23rd: Some American newspapers have recently criticized Eisenhower for his silence regarding the rampant activities of Southern racists. Due to the new developments in the Southern black people's movement for equal rights in recent years, the racist group "White Citizens' Council" has recently launched increasingly rampant terrorist activities against black people in the southern states.

　　The Baltimore "Afro-American" said that Eisenhower sent Nixon to Austria to investigate the so-called Hungarian refugee problem, but he refused to send a senior official to Alabama or Florida to investigate the persecution of black people. The New York "Amsterdam News" said: "How can we promote peace between nations abroad when we allow two races to wage war at home?"

　　"New York Post" commentator Max Lerner also published an article criticizing Eisenhower's "silence." The article pointed out that "with the shooting, bombing, and explosions carried out by the White Citizens' Council thugs in the Deep South, the struggle for not only racial justice but also orderly cooperation has entered a new stage. In the three major states of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, a small but very real war has been launched against a portion of the American people. Buses, grocery stores, roadside markets, and even churches have become the targets of the recent wave of destruction."

　　Lerner said that the violent actions of the White Citizens' Council organizers have two purposes: first, to intimidate black people, to make them leave the buses they ride, the markets where they buy things, and the churches where they worship and meet to strengthen each other for struggle, forcing black people to fight back with violence. Second, once the White Citizens' Council members make black people respond to violence with violence, they will use the cries of bloodshed to unite all white people in the South against black people.

　　Lerner said that the victimized black people "turn to the man in the White House, asking him to speak," but "they find him to be a silent man."

### 坐视种族主义分子鱼肉南方黑人  美报斥艾森豪威尔装聋作哑

    坐视种族主义分子鱼肉南方黑人
    美报斥艾森豪威尔装聋作哑
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国的一些报纸最近抨击艾森豪威尔对南方种族主义分子的猖獗活动采取沉默态度。由于美国南部黑人要求平等权利的运动近年来有新的发展，种族主义团体“白人公民委员会”最近在南部各州对黑人展开了越来越嚣张的恐怖活动。
    巴尔的摩“美国非洲人报”说，艾森豪威尔派了尼克松到奥地利去调查所谓匈牙利难民问题，但是他却不肯派一个高级官吏到亚拉巴马州或者佛罗里达州去调查黑人遭受迫害的情况。纽约“阿姆斯特丹新闻”说：“当我们在国内容许两个种族进行战争的时候，我们怎么能够在国外宣扬国与国之间的和平呢？”
    “纽约邮报”评论员马克思·勒纳也发表文章，指责艾森豪威尔的“缄默”。文章指出，“随着白人公民委员会恶棍们在极南部进行的枪击、轰炸和爆炸，那种不仅争取种族正义，而且争取有秩序的合作的斗争已经进入了一个新阶段。在亚拉巴马、佐治亚和佛罗里达三大州，对一部分美国人民发动了一场小规模的、但是非常真实的战争。公共汽车、杂货商店、路旁市场、甚至教堂，都成了最近产生的破坏浪潮的目标。”
    勒纳说，白人公民委员会组织者的暴力行动有两个目的：第一、恐吓黑人，使他们离开他们乘坐的公共汽车，离开他们购买东西的市场，离开他们做礼拜和会见以便彼此加强来进行斗争的教堂，迫使黑人用暴力来进行反击。第二、一旦白人公民委员会分子使黑人用暴力对付暴力，他们将利用流血的叫嚷来使南部全体白人团结起来对付黑人。
    勒纳说，受害的黑人“转向白宫的那个人，要求他讲话”，但是“他们发现他是一个默不作声的人”。
