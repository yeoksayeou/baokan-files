    Elderly Retired Worker

    Xia Songlin, an elderly pattern maker, started working as a carpenter at the age of fourteen. Before liberation, he lived a miserable life. After liberation, he joined a state-owned factory in Nanjing and enjoyed labor insurance. He retired on pension last March.

    He loves his new life. Although he is seventy years old, he still diligently reads and writes every day, and often studies three-dimensional carving. In just three or four months last year, he completed works such as "Mr. Dongguo," "Mulan Joins the Army," and "Wu Song Beats the Tiger." This is him carving "Mr. Dongguo."

    年老的退休工人
    老年木模工夏松林，十四岁便开始做木工手艺，解放前过着凄凉的生活，解放后，他参加南京一个国营工厂工作，享受了劳动保险，去年3月退休养老。
    他热爱新的生活，虽然已经七十岁了，每天还是孜孜不倦地看书、写字，并且常常钻研立体雕刻，仅去年三、四个月的时间就完成了“东郭先生”“木兰从军”“武松打虎”等作品。这是他在雕刻“东郭先生”。　　　　　　　曲超宏摄（南京日报社稿）
