Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Brussels dispatch: The foreign ministers of France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg met in Brussels on the 4th, attempting to eliminate the remaining differences in establishing the "European Common Market" and the "Atomic Energy Joint Organization." According to the meeting chairman, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, an agreement was reached on establishing a common external tariff and the status of agriculture in the common market; however, "the issue of the participation of French overseas territories remains an obstacle to the completion of the European Atomic Energy Joint Organization and the Common Market Treaty (drafting work)."

According to reports, the so-called "Eurafrica" is the most difficult problem standing in the way of the "Common Market." France is demanding that participating countries raise a joint investment fund to help it develop its overseas territories. In analyzing this issue, the British magazine "The Economist" pointed out that the African market, with a population of 37 million, and other small territories, are welcome commercial targets for exporters from West Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries; however, the price demanded by France is the establishment of an annual $1 billion investment fund to develop these regions.

This issue was not resolved at the meeting of the six foreign ministers held from the 26th to the 28th of last month. At the meeting on the 4th, French Deputy Foreign Minister Fouchet once again requested that the participating countries invest in helping develop African colonies, but these countries were not eager to respond. The Netherlands even took the lead in objecting, saying that it was not wealthy enough to invest in large-scale overseas economic development plans.

There are also reports that many people within the Belgian ruling group also oppose including Belgium's overseas territories in the "Atomic Energy Joint Organization" and the "Common Market" because they are unwilling to let the uranium mines of the Belgian Congo be subject to the control of these organizations.

The meeting decided to recommend that the governments concerned convene another meeting of the six foreign ministers in Paris on the 17th and a meeting of the six heads of government on the 19th in order to finally complete the drafting of the treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th - The British government issued a memorandum to the European Economic Cooperation Bureau on the 7th, reiterating the British government's opinion that a European industrial "free trade area" could be established. The memorandum suggested that an institution should be established at the meeting of the European Economic Cooperation Bureau Committee on February 12th and 13th to negotiate detailed arrangements and draft a convention.

The memorandum explained that the main reason why Britain cannot participate in the currently negotiated European "Common Market" is because Britain wants to maintain the "Imperial Preference System" between Commonwealth countries. It pointed out that the "Common Market" stipulates that participating countries import goods from each other duty-free, while goods from countries outside the participating countries must have a unified tariff, which makes it impossible for Commonwealth countries to enjoy at least the same preferential treatment for imports from Britain as for imports from European countries.

The memorandum then discussed the proposal to establish a "free trade area." It said: "The member states of this free trade area will guarantee the elimination of protective tariffs and other commercial restrictions, including quantitative restrictions, on each other's products. They can freely retain their respective different tariffs on imports from external regions." It particularly emphasized that agricultural products must not be included.

### “共同市场”和“原子联营”计划难产  西欧六国外长再度谈判仍无结果  英国重申建立欧洲“自由贸易区”的主张

    “共同市场”和“原子联营”计划难产
    西欧六国外长再度谈判仍无结果
    英国重申建立欧洲“自由贸易区”的主张
    新华社6日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡六国外交部长4日在布鲁塞尔开会，企图消除建立“欧洲共同市场”和“原子能联营组织”问题中仍然存在的分歧意见。据会议主席、比利时外交大臣斯巴克会后说，会上就建立共同对外关税和农业在共同市场中的地位问题取得了一致意见；但是“法国海外领地参加的问题仍然是阻碍欧洲原子能联营组织和共同市场条约（起草工作）完成的障碍”。
    据消息说，所谓“欧非共同体”是横在“共同市场”道路上的最棘手的问题。法国要求参加国筹集一笔共同投资基金来帮助它开发海外属地。英国“新经济家”杂志在分析这个问题的时候指出，有三千七百万人口的非洲市场和其他小属地，对于西德、荷兰等国的出口商是一个受欢迎的商业对象；但是法国要求的代价是建立一笔每年十亿美元的投资基金来开发这些地区。
    这个问题在六国外交部长上月26日到28日举行的会议上没有获得解决。在4日会议上，法国外交部副部长富尔再一次要求与会各国投资帮助开发非洲殖民地，但是这些国家并不急于答复。荷兰并且带头反对，说它并没有富有到能够向大规模的海外经济开发计划投资。
    还有消息说，比利时统治集团内也有许多人反对把比利时的海外属地包括在“原子能联营组织”和“共同市场”之内，因为他们不愿意让比属刚果的铀矿受这些组织的支配。
    会议决定建议有关政府在17日在巴黎再召开一次六国外长会议，19日举行六国总理会议，以便最后完成条约的起草工作。
    据新华社伦敦8日电　英国政府7日向欧洲经济合作局发出备忘录，重申了英国政府认为可以建立欧洲工业“自由贸易区”的意见。备忘录建议，在2月12日和13日的欧洲经济合作局委员会会议上，应当建立一个机构来谈判详细的安排和拟订公约草案。
    备忘录说明，英国所以不能参加目前正在谈判中的欧洲“共同市场”，主要是因为英国要维持英联邦国家之间的“帝国优惠制”。它指出，“共同市场”规定参加国彼此之间货物免税入口，而对参加国以外的国家则要有统一的关税，这就使得英联邦各国对英国的进口货甚至不能享受像至少是同欧洲各国的进口货一样的优惠待遇。
    备忘录接着谈到建立“自由贸易区”的主张。它说：“这个自由贸易区的成员国将保证在彼此的产品方面取消保护性关税和其他商业上的限制条例，包括数量限制在内。它们可以随意保留它们各自对来自外部地区的进口货的不同的关税”。它特别强调，农产品必须不包括在内。
