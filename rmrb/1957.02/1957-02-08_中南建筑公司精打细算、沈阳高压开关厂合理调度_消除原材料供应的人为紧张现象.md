Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th -- The First Engineering Company of the China National Construction Engineering Management Bureau has mobilized its workers to tap the potential for savings within the enterprise, gradually easing the tense situation in material supply during the first quarter of this year.

The company is responsible for 22% of its annual tasks in the first quarter. The first difficulty encountered in carrying out this task was the insufficient supply of materials. To resolve the contradiction between material needs and supply, the company first conducted an in-depth investigation and research into the past use and management of materials. The results showed that the material supply shortage was due in part to a lack of materials, but also to man-made factors. These man-made factors mainly manifested as: units applying for materials consciously requesting more than needed to be "prepared for any eventuality;" while auditing units often reported the numbers as they were, regardless of whether they were truly needed.

After discovering these situations, the company's leadership immediately took measures to change past practices. They mobilized technical personnel to go to the work sections to help them prepare material usage plans carefully based on the blueprints, and established a responsibility system for rigorous plan review in the technical supervisory units at all levels; when formulating material usage plans, each work section was required to study measures to use materials rationally and accelerate material turnover to save. As a result, the newly ordered material plans for the first quarter were greatly reduced compared to the original plans. At the same time, the company's leadership also clearly explained the difficult situation to all employees and mobilized everyone to find ways to overcome the difficulties. Company leaders went to the work sections and workshops to mobilize, help each work section identify and solve problems, and summarize and promote experience.

After widespread mobilization and strengthened specific leadership, the enthusiasm of the workers for saving grew stronger, and they actively sought ways to find and tap potential. For example, in January, Work Section 102 was short 10,345 bamboo poles, 1,026 pine boards, and 816 fir timbers. After study by all the workers, the original construction method was changed to a two-stage assembly line operation, eliminating the need for the materials that were originally insufficient. A large number of foundation templates originally requested by the processing plant were also replaced by old bamboo templates, based on a suggestion by Assistant Engineer Xu Kuixiang. Work Section 106, which had originally insisted that the company supply five-centimeter-thick scaffolding boards, also decided not to insist on the original request, due to a suggestion from the masses to use specially made bamboo scaffolding boards instead. As of now, the workers have put forward 49 material-saving measures; after all these measures are adopted, the company's circulating materials in the first quarter can be basically replenished without additions, and the tense situation in the supply of other materials has also eased.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th -- The Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory has implemented a material dispatching system, eliminating artificially created material shortages.

In the past, the material section of this factory was like a noisy marketplace every morning, in a state of chaos. Material clerks from various workshops shouted and demanded materials; sometimes, a truckload of materials had just entered the factory and was dragged away by the workshops for use without inspection or warehousing. Facing this situation, the material section conducted an inspection. They found that this material shortage was artificially created. Because the material section did not have a grasp of the production situation and supplied materials without prioritizing urgency, important materials could not be prepared in advance. Only when the workshop material clerks shouted did they temporarily organize manpower to purchase them. There was also a lack of unified dispatching of the factory's limited materials, resulting in temporary division among the workshops, which affected the workshops' ability to produce evenly and delayed the delivery time of products.

Based on the results of the inspection, they established a material dispatching system. The material section established a full-time material dispatcher to specifically grasp the production progress of each workshop. Every week, the material dispatcher specifically presided over a meeting of workshop material clerks to clarify which important materials were needed, and then contacted the purchasing agent. This not only ensured the timely supply of important materials but also allowed for rational dispatching according to priority, enabling the entire factory to achieve balanced production.

The material dispatcher maintained close contact with the purchasing agent, accurately grasping the purchase status of various materials. If he knew in advance that some important materials could not be purchased on time, he would try to find substitute materials as early as possible. For example, it was difficult to buy white backing boards, so material dispatcher Han Shaowen found a batch of slightly thinner white backing boards in the warehouse in advance to substitute. As another example, when enameled wire could not enter the factory on time and there was none in the warehouse, Han Shaowen retrieved enameled wire that had previously been considered substandard and asked experienced winding workers to test it, proving that it met the specifications, which prevented this group from stopping production.

Some of the factory's parts are manufactured by brother factories. When the contracted factories could not produce according to their requirements, the material dispatcher took the initiative to solve the problem by exchanging materials. For example, when manufacturing explosion-proof switches, they discovered in advance that the current transformers, a part manufactured by the Shenyang Transformer Factory, could not be delivered in the current month, but there was another specification of current transformer in the warehouse that was intended for the explosion-proof switch order for next month. The material dispatcher learned that the current month's customer would not pick up the goods in the current month, so he suggested that the workshop exchange the current month's task with next month's task. In this way, the material supply work did not become chaotic due to the untimely supply of parts manufactured by brother factories.

From the beginning of 1956 to the present, since the implementation of the material dispatching system, the material supply work in this factory has been very normal.

### 中南建筑公司精打细算、沈阳高压开关厂合理调度  消除原材料供应的人为紧张现象

    中南建筑公司精打细算、沈阳高压开关厂合理调度
    消除原材料供应的人为紧张现象
    新华社武汉6日电　中南建筑工程管理总局第一工程公司发动职工群众挖掘企业内部的节约潜力，使今年第一季度材料供应的紧张局面逐渐缓和下来。
    这个公司今年第一季度担负的任务占全年任务22％。执行这个任务中首先碰到的困难，是材料供应不足。公司为了解决材料的需要和供应之间存在的矛盾，首先对以往材料的使用和管理情况作了深入的调查研究。结果发现材料供应紧张，一方面是因为材料不足，另一方面是存在着人为的因素。这种人为因素的主要表现是：申请用料的单位在编制计划时有意识地多要一些，以便“有备无患”；而查核单位又往往不管是否真正需要，如数上报。
    公司领导方面发现了这些情况以后，立即采取措施改变过去的作法。他们发动技术人员到工段去，帮助工段根据图纸精打细算地编制用料计划，在各级技术主管单位建立认真审核计划的责任制度；各工段在制订用料计划的时候，要研究出合理使用材料、加速材料周转的节约措施。这样作的结果，第一季度的新订用料计划比原计划大为缩小。同时，公司领导方面还把困难情况向全体职工群众讲清楚，发动大家共同想办法来克服困难。公司领导干部分头下到工段、车间去动员，帮助各工段发现和解决问题，总结和推广经验。
    经过了广泛的动员又加强了具体领导以后，职工群众节约劲头越来越大，纷纷想办法找潜力、挖潜力。例如一○二工段1月份差竹子一万零三百四十五根，松板一千零二十六块，杉木八百一十六根，经过全工段职工群众研究以后，将原来的施工方法改为两段流水作业，使原来不够的材料都可以不需要了。加工厂原计划要的大量基础模板，经过助理工程师徐奎祥提出建议，也全部用旧竹模板代替了。原来提出非要公司供应五公分厚脚手板不可的一○六工段，也由于根据群众建议改用竹子特制的脚手板代替，决定不再坚持原来的要求。截至目前为止，职工们已经提出四十九项节约材料的办法；这些办法全部采用以后，第一季度全公司的周转材料可以基本上不需要增添，其他材料的供应紧张局面目前也已经缓和下来。
    新华社沈阳6日电　沈阳高压开关厂实行材料调度制度，消除了人为的材料紧张现象。
    过去，在这个厂的材料科里，每天早晨就像个闹市一样，乱烘烘的，各车间的材料员喊着叫着要材料；有时，一车材料刚进厂，不等鉴定、入库，就被车间拉去使用。面对着这种情况，材料科进行了检查。他们发现这种材料紧张现象是人为地造成的。因为材料科没有掌握生产情况，供应材料不分轻重缓急，盲目供应，因此使重要的材料不能预先做好准备，直到车间材料员叫喊了，才临时组织人力出来采购，对厂内仅有的材料，也缺乏统一的调度，形成各车间临时瓜分，影响各车间不能均衡地生产，拖延了产品出厂时间。
    他们根据检查的结果，建立了材料调度制度。材料科设立了专职的材料调度员，专门掌握各车间生产进度。每个星期里，材料调度员专门主持召开车间材料员会议，弄清需要那些重要的材料，然后同采购员联系。这样，不仅保证重要材料的及时供应，而且还能按照轻重缓急合理地调度，使整个工厂达到均衡生产。
    材料调度员同采购员保持着密切的联系，准确地掌握各种材料的采购情况，如果预先知道有些重要的材料不能按期买到，便提早设法寻找代用材料。例如反白板很难买到，材料调度员韩少文就提早把仓库里的一批厚度略薄的反白板找来代用。又如漆包线未能按期进厂，库里又没有，韩少文就及早把过去认为不合规格的漆包线拿去，请有经验的卷线工人试验，证明合乎规格，使这个小组没有停产。
    这个厂有一些部件是由兄弟厂承制的。在承制厂不能按他们要求生产出来的时候，材料调度员便主动地采取串换的方法加以解决。如在制造防爆开关的时候，事先发现沈阳变压器厂承制的部件电流互感器不能在当月交货，但是库里有另一种规格的电流互感器，是给下月的订户生产防爆开关用的，材料调度员了解到本月的订户不在本月取货，就建议车间把当月任务同下月任务串换过来。这样，材料供应工作就没有因为兄弟厂承制的部件供应不及时而发生混乱。
    从1956年初到目前为止，这个厂执行材料调度制度以来，材料供应工作一直很正常。
