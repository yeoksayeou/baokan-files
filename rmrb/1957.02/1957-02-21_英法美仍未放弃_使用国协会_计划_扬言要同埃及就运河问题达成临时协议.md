Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch from London: A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 17th that Britain, France, and the United States will propose a suggestion for reaching a provisional agreement with Egypt on the Suez Canal issue.

A reporter asked who would negotiate such a suggestion? The spokesman said: "This will obviously be negotiated by Egypt and the users through the United Nations."

Another reporter asked if the provisional suggestion meant that it would be implemented before Israeli troops withdrew from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba? The spokesman said: "The intention is to make these suggestions applicable to the period between when the canal is navigable and when a final arrangement has not been reached."

When a reporter asked how the provisional suggestion would arrange the canal passage fees, the spokesman only replied that the users had "reached a general agreement." However, according to Western news agencies, according to the agreement, canal passage fees will be handed over to the World Bank, half of which will be recorded under Egypt's account, and the other half will be disposed of after the canal issue is resolved.

A reporter asked whether the new suggestion meant that the "Canal Users' Association" would no longer be effective. The spokesman replied: "That is absolutely not the case."

This provisional suggestion, initiated and drafted by Britain, has been submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General.

    英法美仍未放弃“使用国协会”计划
    扬言要同埃及就运河问题达成临时协议
    新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人17日说，英、法、美三国将提出一项同埃及就苏伊士运河问题达成临时协议的建议。
    有记者问，这样一项建议由谁来进行谈判？发言人说：“这显然将通过联合国由埃及和使用国进行谈判”。
    还有记者问，临时建议是否意味着在以色列军队撤出加沙地带和亚喀巴湾以前就将实施？发言人说：“打算使这些建议通用于运河可以航行而最后安排还没有达成之间这段时期”。
    当记者问到临时建议怎样安排运河通行费问题的时候，发言人只回答说，使用国已经“取得一般协议”。但是据西方通讯社透露，根据协议，运河通行费将交给世界银行，一半记在埃及账下，另一半待运河问题解决后再来处置。
    记者问，新的建议出来以后是否意味着“运河使用国协会”不再起作用了。发言人回答说：“根本不是这样”。
    这项由英国倡议拟订的临时建议已经送交联合国秘书长。
