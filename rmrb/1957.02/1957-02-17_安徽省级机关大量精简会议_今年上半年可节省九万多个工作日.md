    Hefei, February 16th (This newspaper) – The Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anhui Provincial People's Committee recently reviewed the plans of their subordinate units for holding various meetings in the first half of this year. They reduced many unnecessary meetings, saving a total of over 90,000 workdays. The various departments and commissions of the Anhui Provincial Committee planned to hold eighty-eight meetings of various kinds in the first half of the year, with a total meeting time of four hundred and ninety days and a total of nine thousand five hundred and nine attendees. According to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, the Secretariat of the Provincial Committee decided to resolutely not hold meetings that could be avoided, to merge meetings that could be combined, and to reduce the number of participants and shorten the meeting time as much as possible for meetings that must be held. As a result, the total number of meetings was reduced to forty-one, the total meeting time was reduced to two hundred and fifty-six days, and the total number of attendees was reduced to four thousand nine hundred and sixty-one. It is estimated that due to the reduction of meetings, the various departments and commissions of the Provincial Committee can save at least more than 20,000 yuan in meeting expenses in the first half of this year. If calculated based on each person participating in five days of meetings, more than 20,000 workdays can be saved. The various departments and bureaus of the Anhui Provincial People's Committee have reduced a total of thirty-six meetings in the first half of the year, reducing the number of meeting participants by more than nine thousand two hundred people, saving approximately more than seventy thousand workdays.

    安徽省级机关大量精简会议
    今年上半年可节省九万多个工作日
    本报合肥16日电　中共安徽省委书记处和省人民委员会最近分别审查了所属单位今年上半年召开各种会议的计划，核减了许多不必召开的会议，共可节省九万多个工作日。安徽省委各部、委计划上半年召开各种会议八十八次，会议的总时间为四百九十天，出席会议的总人数九千五百零九人。省委书记处根据增产节约精神，确定可以不开的会议坚决不开，可以合并的会议合并召开，必须召开的会议也应减少参加人数和尽量缩短会议时间。结果会议总次数精简为四十一次，会议总时间减为二百五十六天，出席会议的总人数减为四千九百六十一人。估计由于会议减少，省委各部、委今年上半年最少能节约会议经费两万多元；如果以每人参加五天会议时间计算，就可节约两万多个工作日。安徽省人民委员会各厅、局上半年共核减了三十六次会议，核减了参加会议的人数九千二百多人，大约可节省七万多个工作日。
