    A nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy is underway. Many industrial, construction, and transportation enterprises, when arranging their 1957 production tasks, have paid attention to mobilizing the masses to tap the potential for increasing production and practicing economy. Some units have already achieved preliminary results. However, what exactly should we strive to increase production of, and what should we conserve? This question should be clarified.
    Increasing the production of raw materials and conserving raw materials—these are the main aspects of this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy in the industrial sector. This is of great significance for accelerating China's socialist industrialization, for better meeting the growing social needs, and for overcoming the current difficulties in economic life. The experience of the past few years tells us that the scale and speed of a country's industrial construction and production should primarily be adapted to the production level of the raw materials required for production and construction. China is a large country with a backward economy and a large population. From the perspective of social needs, the larger the scale of construction and production, the better, and the faster the speed, the better. However, the supply of raw materials does not allow us to make the scale too large or the speed too fast. Currently, some basic construction projects that have already started or are being prepared to start have had to temporarily stop construction or extend the construction period due to a shortage of steel, cement, wood, etc. Some machinery and electrical appliance manufacturing plants cannot fully utilize their equipment capacity due to a lack of steel or insufficient investment. The iron and steel industry cannot greatly increase production due to a lack of iron ore, coke, and fuel. The production of the cotton textile industry, the oil industry, the food industry, and other daily necessities industries, with the exception of a few industries, cannot be greatly increased due to insufficient raw material supply. Social needs are constantly growing, and there is also a certain potential on the production side, but raw materials are restricting us everywhere. This is the main difficulty in China's current economic life.
    To fundamentally overcome this difficulty, the further development of China's raw material industry and agriculture is, of course, needed. This will take a considerable amount of time to gradually achieve. However, at present, we should not passively wait in the face of this difficulty, but should adopt a positive attitude. The so-called positive attitude is that, on the one hand, in formulating basic construction and production plans, the supply of raw materials should be taken into account. On the other hand, raw material and power industries such as metallurgy, fuel, building materials, and electricity should do everything possible to improve production indicators and strive to overfulfill the state plan with the greatest effort. Departments such as machinery and electrical appliance manufacturing industry, chemical industry, textile industry, food industry, paper industry, construction and transportation enterprises must strive to reduce the consumption quota of raw materials, reduce the loss of raw materials in transportation and storage, rationally utilize raw materials, and fully utilize old materials, waste materials, and substitutes under the condition of ensuring and improving product quality. In a word, fight for increasing the production of raw materials and conserving raw materials. Only through increasing production and conserving raw materials can we ease the tight supply of raw materials, produce more industrial products needed by society, and complete more construction workload.
    Some people say that since liberation, campaigns to increase production and practice economy have been carried out almost every year. Where is there any more "fat" to be squeezed out? It is true that mass campaigns to increase production and practice economy have been carried out in the past few years, and great achievements have been made every year. However, due to the continuous improvement of the technical level of the broad masses of workers and due to the continuous enrichment of enterprises' production management experience, there is still a lot of "fat" to be squeezed out now. According to a preliminary investigation by the State Economic Commission, various industries can still increase production and save a large amount of raw materials. For example, in the coal industry, if all miners pay attention to quality and reduce the ash content and gangue of national coal by 1% to 2% this year, it will be equivalent to increasing the production of 2.4 million to 4.8 million tons of coal. According to the coal production situation in recent years, this is possible. In the building materials industry, as long as safe production is ensured and accidents are reduced, production can be increased. For example, if state-owned cement plants reduce the number of "ring formation" accidents to the level of 1955 this year, the country will be able to increase production by at least 50,000 to 60,000 tons of cement. In the metallurgical industry, expanding the source of iron ore and coke is the key to increasing steel production. According to investigations, the iron content in the slag of sulfuric acid by-products is about 50%. This year, China's chemical factories and some paper mills will produce 500,000 to 600,000 tons of this slag. If it can be utilized as much as possible, a lot of iron can be produced. In the light industry, there are also many raw material resources that have not been fully utilized. There are more than 40 kinds of substitutes that can be used for bast fibers alone. Among them, cotton stalks alone have about 9.2 million dan per year that can be used for weaving linen, sacks, papermaking, wrapping cables, etc. China produces about 5,000 tons of cashmere per year, only half of which is utilized. The country produces about 15,000 tons of miscellaneous hair from cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, etc. a year, but only 1% is purchased. All of these should be fully utilized in every possible way.
    There is a huge possibility for saving raw materials. The machinery and electrical appliance manufacturing industry is the department that uses the most steel. In recent years, although China's designers have made significant achievements in product design, phenomena such as uneconomical machine design and excessively large safety factors still exist. The blueprints of many products were designed decades ago or even decades ago. The steel used to produce machines according to these blueprints is much more than that used to produce similar machines abroad today. Recently, some machinery manufacturing plants in Shenyang, Shanghai and other places have made partial modifications to the design of some product drawings. Under the condition of ensuring product performance, steel can generally be saved by about 10%, and some can even save more than 20%. In the process of machine manufacturing, metal loss is generally relatively large. It is estimated that to produce the same amount of machines, China consumes about 15% more steel and other metal materials than the Soviet Union. If the method of metal processing is improved and the utilization rate of metal materials is increased by an average of 5% to 10%, the country can save 60,000 to 100,000 tons of metal materials this year. As for the fact that advanced enterprises use less materials than backward enterprises, and advanced workers use less materials than ordinary workers in the manufacture of similar products, this further illustrates how broad the possibility of saving raw materials is. We must see that many raw materials have not been fully utilized or have not been rationally utilized, and even there are phenomena of waste. Industrial leaders at all levels should mobilize engineers, technicians and workers to actively look for various effective measures, find and use substitutes, open up new sources of raw materials, and promptly summarize and promote the experience of advanced units and advanced workers in saving, so as to tap all potential forces and block all loopholes of waste.
    In order to rapidly increase the production of raw materials, especially the output of materials such as metals, fuels, and cement that have a special effect on the national economy, we should comprehensively consider the economic effects of large, medium, and small factories and mines. Appropriate material resources, financial resources, and human resources should be allocated to actively restore and appropriately expand the original small coal mines, metal mines, iron smelting plants, cement plants, etc. according to the possible conditions of resources. When necessary, a number of such small factories and mines can also be newly built. Local industrial departments should play a greater initiative and enthusiasm in this work. In addition, various raw material supply departments must actively purchase industrial raw materials at home and abroad and strive to supply the needs of various industrial departments.
    The tendency to unilaterally emphasize increasing production and saving while ignoring product quality must be prevented. Whether it is a raw material production department or a processing and manufacturing department, whether it is a means of production production department or a consumer goods production department, when increasing production and saving, efforts should be made to ensure and improve product quality, reduce the rate of substandard products, and reduce and eliminate defective products. Industrial leaders at all levels should put forward specific requirements for the product quality of their subordinate enterprises, and stipulate systems to strictly supervise and inspect to ensure their realization.

### 增产原材料，节约原材料

    增产原材料，节约原材料
    全国范围的增产节约运动正在开展。许多工业企业、建筑企业、交通运输企业在布置1957年的生产任务的时候，都注意发动群众挖掘增产节约的潜力，有的单位已经取得了初步的成果。但是，究竟应该努力增产哪些东西，节约哪些东西呢？这个问题应该弄清楚。
    增产原材料，节约原材料，这就是工业部门今年增产节约的主要方面。这对于加速我国社会主义工业化的建设，对于更好地满足日益增长的社会需要，对于克服当前经济生活中的困难，都有重要的意义。过去几年的经验告诉我们，一个国家的工业建设和生产的规模和速度，主要的应该跟生产和建设所需要的原材料的生产水平相适应。我国是一个经济落后人口众多的大国，从社会需要来看，建设和生产的规模是越大越好的，速度是越快越好的。但是，原材料的供应状况，却不允许我们把规模弄得太大，把速度弄得太快。现时有些已经开工了的或已经筹备开工的基本建设工程，因为缺少钢材、水泥、木材等，不得不暂时停止施工，或延长建设期限。有些机器和电器制造厂，因为缺乏钢材或投资不足，不能充分发挥设备能力。钢铁工业因为缺乏铁矿石，缺乏焦炭和燃料，不能大量增产。棉纺织业、油脂工业、食品工业和其他日用品工业的生产，除少数行业以外，也因为原料供应不足而不能大量增产。社会需要不断地增长，生产方面也有一定潜力，而原材料却处处限制我们，这就是当前我国经济生活中的主要困难。
    要根本克服这个困难，当然需要我国原料工业和农业的进一步发展。这需要相当长的时间才能逐步做到。但是，目前我们也不应该在这个困难面前消极等待，而应该采取积极的态度。所谓积极的态度，就是一方面在制订基本建设和生产计划的时候，要考虑到原材料的供应状况。另一方面，冶金、燃料、建筑材料和电力等原料和动力工业部门，要尽一切可能地提高生产指标，以最大的努力争取超额完成国家计划；而机器和电器制造工业、化学工业、纺织工业、食品工业、造纸工业、建筑和交通运输企业等部门，必须在保证和提高产品质量的条件下，努力降低原材料的消耗定额，减少原材料在运输、保管中的损耗，合理地利用原材料，充分利用旧料、废料和代用品。一句话，就是为增产原材料、节约原材料而斗争。只有通过增产和节约原材料的途径，才能缓和原材料供应的紧张情况，生产更多的为社会所需要的工业产品，完成更多的建筑工作量。
    有人说，解放以来几乎年年都开展增产节约运动，哪里还有什么“油水”？不错，过去几年都开展了群众性的增产节约运动，并且每年都取得了很大的成绩。但是，由于广大职工的技术水平不断提高，由于企业的生产管理经验不断丰富，现在的“油水”还很不少。根据国家经济委员会的初步调查，各类工业都还可以增产和节约大量的原材料。例如煤炭工业，如果全体矿工们注意质量，把今年全国煤炭的灰分和矸石等减少1％到2％，就等于增产二百四十万到四百八十万吨煤。根据近年来煤炭生产的情况来看，这是可能做到的。在建筑材料工业中，只要保证安全生产，减少事故，就可以增产。例如国营水泥厂，今年只要把“结圈”事故减少到1955年的次数，全国至少就能增产五、六万吨水泥。在冶金工业方面，扩大铁矿石和焦炭的来源，是增加钢铁产量的关键。据调查，制造硫酸副产品的矿渣中含铁量在50％左右。今年我国化学工厂和部分造纸厂将生产五、六十万吨这种矿渣，如果尽量加以利用，就可以增产不少的铁。在轻工业方面，也有许多原料资源还没有被充分利用。单是麻类可以利用的代用品就有四十多种。其中棉秆皮一种每年就有九百二十万担左右可以用来织麻布、麻袋、造纸、包电缆等。我国每年生产约五千吨左右的山羊绒，只被利用了一半。全国一年出产的牛、马、骡、驴等杂毛，估计有一万五千吨，也只收购了1％。这些都应该设法充分加以利用。
    原材料的节约有巨大的可能性。机器和电器制造工业是使用钢材最多的部门。几年来，我国设计人员在产品设计中虽已做出显著的成绩，但是机器设计得不够经济、安全系数过大等现象仍然存在。还有不少产品的图纸是十几年甚至几十年前设计的，按照这些图纸生产机器所使用的钢材，要比目前国外生产的同类机器所使用的多得多。最近沈阳、上海等地的一些机器制造厂对部分产品图纸设计作了部分修改，在保证产品性能的条件下，一般都可以节约钢材10％左右，有的甚至节约20％以上。在机器制造过程中，金属损耗一般都比较大。据估计，生产同样多的机器，我国要比苏联多消耗15％左右的钢材和其它金属材料。如果改进金属加工方法，把金属材料利用率平均提高5％到10％，今年全国就可以节约金属材料六万吨到十万吨。至于在制造同类产品中，先进企业比落后企业、先进工人比普通工人所使用的材料少，这更说明了节约原材料的可能性多么广泛。我们必须看到有许多原材料没有被充分利用或者没有被合理利用甚至有被浪费的现象。各级工业领导部门应该发动工程技术人员和工人，积极寻找各种有效措施，寻找和利用代用品、开辟新的原材料来源，及时地总结先进单位和先进职工的节约经验，加以推广，把一切潜在的力量都挖掘出来，把一切浪费的漏洞都堵住。
    为了迅速地增产原材料，特别是对国民经济具有特殊作用的金属、燃料、水泥等物资的产量，我们应当通盘地考虑大、中、小型厂矿的经济效果。要抽出适当的物力、财力和人力，根据资源的可能条件，积极地恢复和适当地扩建原有小型的煤矿、金属矿、炼铁厂、水泥厂等。在必要的时候，还可以新建一批这类的小型厂矿。地方工业部门在这个工作中应该发挥更大的主动性和积极性。此外，各个原材料供应部门必须积极地收购国内外的工业原材料，努力供应各工业部门的需要。
    片面地强调增产和节约而忽视产品质量的倾向必须防止。不论是原材料生产部门或加工制造部门，不论是生产资料生产部门或消费资料生产部门，在增产节约的时候，都应该努力保证和提高产品质量，降低次品率，减少和消灭废品。各级工业领导部门，应当对所属企业的产品质量提出具体要求，并且规定制度，严格督促和检查，以保证其实现。
