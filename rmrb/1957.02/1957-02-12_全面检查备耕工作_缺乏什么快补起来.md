    (Our report) The Xiyang Village Agricultural Cooperative in Neiqiu County, Hebei Province, conducted a comprehensive inspection of spring ploughing preparations and found that many farm tools had varying degrees of damage. The cooperative immediately organized members to repair them. The cooperative's seeds have been prepared, inspected, selected, and properly stored.

    In addition, the cooperative also calculated the area of ​​cultivated land borne by livestock and felt that the animal power was very insufficient. It was decided that in addition to strengthening the feeding of existing livestock, a portion of the public accumulation fund and sideline income would be used, and members would be mobilized to invest another 2,000 yuan to buy livestock.

    全面检查备耕工作  缺乏什么快补起来
    本报讯　河北内丘县西阳村农业社全面检查春耕准备工作，发现有不少农具有程度不同的损坏。社里随即组织了社员进行检修。该社的种籽已经备齐，并且经过检查和挑选，妥善地保管起来。
    另外，这个社还对牲畜所负担的耕地面积算了账，感到畜力很不足，确定除加强现有牲口的饲养外，并从公积金和副业收入中拿出一部分款，再发动社员投资两千元，用这些钱去买牲畜。
