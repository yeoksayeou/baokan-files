The Objective Situation Puts Forward Higher Demands on the Democratic Parties
Zhang Nanxian

For several years, under the leadership and education of the Party, I have always deeply felt that the Party's policies invariably contain both humanity's most progressive socialist ideals and are in line with the revolutionary realities of the Chinese people.

The Central Committee of the Party, in the period when our country entered socialist construction, proposed that "we must continue to strengthen cooperation with the democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 in accordance with the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and give full play to the role of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and consultation bodies at all levels." (Resolution on the Political Report of the Eighth National Congress) This is precisely a vivid example of the Chinese Communist Party's creative and unique solution to building socialism, considering the specific conditions of its own country and one aspect of domestic political relations.

I have constantly pondered the following questions: What is the social foundation of the democratic parties and non-party democratic人士? Should they continue to exist after the completion of socialist transformation? What are their historical tasks? Until the Party put forward the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," I initially did not fully appreciate its essence. After studying, especially in September last year, when I was extremely honored to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Party as a nonvoting delegate and studied the Party's report and the speeches of the delegates, I began to appreciate the great significance of this principle.

Now I will write down my personal superficial understanding and experience of the Party's principle, hoping that readers will point out any errors.

In general, I believe that the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is proposed by the Party after fully considering the specific conditions of its own country, aiming at the characteristics of class relations in Chinese society, in order to further promote political democracy within the people and unite the broadest masses of the people to jointly build socialism. This principle embodies the urgent demand of the broadest masses of the people in the country to unite more closely under the leadership of the Communist Party in the period of socialist construction; this principle reflects the close and harmonious relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the various democratic parties. Therefore, we must never mechanically apply the concept of "political parties" in capitalist countries, nor can we mechanically transplant the relationship between political parties in capitalist societies, which is full of contradictions and antagonisms, to understand the Party's principle.

In capitalist societies, political parties are the product of the intensification of class struggle and are political organizations that safeguard the interests of their own class. There is no doubt about this. The relationship between different political parties (whether between proletarian parties and bourgeois parties, or even between bourgeois parties with different names) is always full of contradictions and conflicts, and there is no doubt about this either. But we must not use this to draw analogies to the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the various democratic parties. Class relations in Chinese society have their own characteristics, and the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the various democratic parties is fundamentally different from the relationship between various political parties in capitalist countries.

The class relations in China, formed from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, have two characteristics: First, there are many classes and complex class relations, unlike the class relations in capitalist societies, where the main classes, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, are simply and obviously polarized. Between the broad masses of workers and peasants and the three major enemies, there are numerous middle classes and strata, among which the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie and their intellectuals are the social foundation of the democratic parties and non-party democratic人士. The various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 in China were formed in the class conflicts between these middle classes and strata and the three major enemies. Second, the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 is a close, united, and harmonious one, and this close cooperative relationship has been strengthened with the development of the Chinese revolution. The classes and strata that the various democratic parties in China are associated with and represent also have demands to resist the three major enemies, just like the Chinese working class. Before the Chinese working class had formed an independent political force, they had also independently resisted and struggled against imperialism and feudalism, but they failed. It was not until under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in the process of the national democratic revolution, that they played an effective, auxiliary, and cooperative combat role. It is precisely because of accepting the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the experiences and lessons personally felt in the Chinese revolutionary struggle, that talents from these classes and strata have gradually realized that, under the historical characteristics of the Chinese revolution, only by firmly following the Communist Party to socialism is the inevitable path of history. Therefore, in the past few years, in the socialist revolution led by the Communist Party, on the one hand, they have continued to play a cooperative combat role on various fronts, and on the other hand, they have begun to have a conscious demand for self-education and self-transformation, and have already had specific manifestations of betraying and breaking away from the various innate and acquired constraints of their own class. In the period when the country entered socialist construction, the decisive victory of the Party's great socialist transformation and the Party's call for unity and socialist construction at the Eighth National Congress encouraged them. Both objective and subjective conditions have made people from these classes and strata have new and urgent demands for progress, demanding to further accept the Party's leadership and education, so as to more fully and effectively exert their abilities in the long march of socialist construction. The various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士, which appear as representatives of these classes and strata, precisely represent the active side of their continuous progress.

From this, it can be seen that with the development of the revolutionary situation, the objective situation has already put forward higher responsibilities and requirements for the various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士. The Party's principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is put forward at this time, and it precisely reflects and satisfies the objective requirements of the various democratic parties to further strive for the Party's leadership and education, so as to better exert their initiative. Therefore, it has been warmly supported and wholeheartedly embraced by the various democratic parties.

On the other hand, and this is the decisive aspect, the Party's principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is put forward based on the historical mission of the Chinese working class. The historical mission of the proletariat is not only to liberate its own class, but also to liberate all of humanity from all systems of exploitation and enslavement. In view of the characteristics of class relations in Chinese society, as well as the long-term backward state inherited from history in our country, the Chinese working class has the responsibility to mobilize, organize, and transform all the broadest social forces, except for the extremely small number of die-hard reactionary class elements, to build a backward agricultural country with 600 million people into an advanced industrial country. Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 is an effective and easy way to unite, educate, and transform these broad social forces.

From the above, it can be seen that the proposal of the Party's principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" has its objective basis. From the above, it can also be seen that under the specific historical conditions of China, although the Chinese Communist Party and the various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 have their own different social foundations, they are completely consistent in the fundamental interests of building socialism. Moreover, this political and ideological socialist consistency, under the condition of firmly implementing the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, will inevitably increase with the progress of socialist construction, due to the fact that the Communist Party's leadership and education for the various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 will be further strengthened, and the self-education and forward progress of self-education of the various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士. This increasing socialist consistency is bound to promote the long-term development of socialist construction, which is undoubtedly certain.

"Long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is a complete principle. Long-term coexistence is precisely for the purpose of giving play to the role of mutual supervision.

Historically, no political party has ever been able to place all its activities under the supervision of the masses of the people proactively and publicly like the Communist Party. This is because, "Unlike the political parties of the bourgeoisie, the political party of the working class does not regard the masses of the people as its own tools, but consciously recognizes that it is a tool of the masses of the people in a specific historical period for completing a specific historical task." (Comrade Deng Xiaoping: Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution)

In a country like ours, with a large population and long-term backwardness, carrying out large-scale socialist construction work is impossible without the strong leadership of the Party, and in order to strengthen the Party's leadership, it is necessary to fully mobilize all social forces.

Therefore, the Party's principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," as far as I can currently understand it, is not only for the purpose of discovering all the shortcomings in the work of the state in a timely manner through various forms of mutual supervision, thereby continuously improving socialist construction work (of course, this is also very important), but its essence lies in giving the fullest play to political democracy within the people, and mobilizing and organizing the masses of the people to participate in national political activities through the form of long-term cooperation and supervision between the parties, infinitely giving play to the political initiative and political enthusiasm of the masses of the people, and greatly strengthening the leadership role of the Party and the state.

It is precisely because of this that I have initially realized the new and higher responsibilities of the various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士 under the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and have initially realized the urgent significance of "giving full play to the role of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and consultation bodies at all levels."

In short, the proposal of the Party's principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" marks that the Party's people's democratic united front has entered a new stage, and it means that there has been new development in domestic political relations. The objective form has already put forward higher responsibilities and requirements for the various democratic parties and non-party democratic人士. It is very important to study and understand this principle, and it is also extremely important to examine and improve how to better learn from the Party and better connect with the masses.

### 客观形势向民主党派提出了更高的要求

    客观形势向民主党派提出了更高的要求	张难先
    几年来在党的领导和教育下，我随时都深深地感到，在党的政策里面，无一不是既包含着人类最进步的社会主义理想，而又切合于中国人民的革命实际。
    党中央在我国进入社会主义建设时期所提出的“必须按照长期共存、互相监督的方针，继续加强同各民主党派和无党派民主人士的合作，并且充分发挥人民政治协商会议和各级协商机构的作用。”（“八大”关于政治报告的决议）正就是中国共产党考虑了自己国家的特殊条件，在国内政治关系的一个方面上创造性地、非常独特地解决了建设社会主义方法的生动范例。
    我曾不断思考过以下一些问题：各民主党派和无党派民主人士的社会基础是什么？在社会主义改造完成以后，它是否应当继续存在下去？它的历史任务怎样？直到党已经提出了“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，我最初还没有很好体会到它的精神实质。经过学习，特别是在去年9月，万分荣幸地列席了党的第八次全国代表大会，学习了党的报告和代表们的发言，才初步体会到这个方针的重大意义。
    现在把我个人对党这一方针的粗浅认识和体会写出来，希望读者予以指正。
    总的说来，我认为，“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，是党充分考虑了自己国家的特殊条件，针对着中国社会阶级关系的特点，为了进一步发扬人民内部的政治民主，团结全国最广大的人民来共同建设社会主义提出来的。这个方针，体现了国家进入社会主义建设时期全国最广大的人民更进一步地在共产党领导下紧密团结起来的迫切要求；这个方针，反映出中国共产党和各个民主党派之间的亲密无间和谐一致的关系。因而，决不能机械地运用资本主义国家“政党”的概念，决不能机械地搬弄资本主义社会那种充满矛盾对抗的政党之间的关系，来理解党这一方针。
    在资本主义社会里面，政党是阶级斗争尖锐化的产物，是维护其本阶级利益的政治组织。这是没有疑问的。不同政党之间的关系（无论是无产阶级政党和资产阶级政党之间，以至于不同名称的资产阶级政党之间）总是充满着矛盾和冲突的关系，这也是没有疑问的。但决不能把这拿来类比中国共产党和各民主党派之间的关系。中国社会的阶级关系有其特点，中国共产党和各民主党派之间的关系也就根本不同于资本主义国家各种不同政党之间的关系。
    从半殖民地半封建社会里形成起来的中国的阶级关系，有两个特点：第一是阶级多、阶级关系复杂，不像资本主义社会的阶级关系主要是无产阶级和资产阶级两大阶级分极对立那样简单明显。处在广大的工农群众和三大敌人中间的，有着为数众多的中间阶级和阶层，其中的民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级及其知识分子，是各民主党派和无党派民主人士的社会基础。中国的各民主党派、无党派民主人士就是在这些中间阶级阶层和三大敌人的阶级冲突中所形成的。第二、中国共产党和各个民主党派无党派民主人士之间的关系，是一种亲密团结、和谐一致的关系，而且这种亲密的团结合作的关系，是随着中国革命的发展日益加强起来的。中国各民主党派所联系所代表的这些阶级和阶层，它们和中国工人阶级同样有着反抗三大敌人的要求，在中国工人阶级还没有形成为独立的政治力量以前，它们还曾经单独地进行过对帝国主义和封建主义的反抗和斗争，但是失败了，一直到了在中国共产党的领导下，在民族民主革命的过程中，才起了有效的、辅助的和配合的战斗作用。正是由于接受了中国共产党的领导和教育，以及自己在中国革命斗争中亲身感受到的经验和教训，从这些阶级和阶层出身的人才逐渐认识到，在中国革命的历史特点之下，只有坚定地跟着共产党走向社会主义，才是历史必由的路。因而，这几年，它们在共产党领导着的社会主义革命过程中，一方面在各项战线上继续地起着配合战斗的作用，一方面开始有了自我教育自我改造的自觉要求，并且已经有了背叛和摆脱本阶级各种先天后天束缚的具体表现。在国家进入了社会主义建设时期，党的伟大的社会主义改造的决定性的胜利，党的“八大”团结建设社会主义的号召，鼓舞了他们，客观形势和主观条件都使从这些阶级、阶层出身的人们有了新的、迫切进步的要求，要求进一步接受党的领导和教育，以便在万里长征的社会主义建设过程中，更充分有效地发挥自己的能力。作为这些阶级阶层代表旗帜而出现的各民主党派和无党派民主人士，正是代表着他们这种不断前进的积极性的一面的。
    由此可见，随着革命形势的发展，客观的形势已经对各民主党派和无党派民主人士提出来更高的责任和要求了。党的“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，正在这个时候提出来，它正是反映了和满足了各民主党派进一步争取党的领导教育，以便更好发挥其积极性的客观要求的。因而，受到了各民主党派的热烈支持和衷心拥护。
    另一方面，也是决定性的一方面，党的“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，是根据中国工人阶级的历史使命提出来的。无产阶级的历史使命，不只是要把本阶级，而且要把全人类从一切剥削奴役制度下解放出来，针对着中国社会阶级关系的特点，以及我国从历史上遗留下来的长期落后的状态，中国工人阶级有责任动员、组织、改造除了极其少数的死心塌地的反动阶级分子以外的一切最广大的社会力量来把六亿人口的落后农业国建设成为先进的工业国。通过和各民主党派、无党派民主人士的长期共存、互相监督，正是团结、教育、改造这些广大社会力量的有效易行的途径。
    由上可见，党的“长期共存、互相监督”的方针的提出，是有其客观依据的。由上又可见，在中国的具体历史条件下，尽管中国共产党和各民主党派、无党派民主人士是各有其不同的社会基础的，但在建设社会主义的根本利益上是完全一致的，而且这种政治上思想上的社会主义一致性，在坚决实现长期共存、互相监督方针的条件下，由于共产党对于各个民主党派无党派民主人士的领导教育将更要加强，各民主党派、无党派民主人士的自我教育和自我教育的向前进步，随着社会主义建设的进展，是必然日益增长的。这种日益增长的社会主义一致性又必然要反过来促进社会主义建设事业长足发展，这是定然无疑的。
    “长期共存、互相监督”是一个完整的方针，长期共存，正是为了发挥互相监督的作用。
    历史上从来没有一个政党能够像共产党这样，把自己的一切活动，主动地、公开地摆在人民群众的监督之下的。这是因为，“同资产阶级的政党相反，工人阶级的政党不是把人民群众当作自己的工具，而是自觉地认定自己是人民群众在特定的历史时期为完成特定的历史任务的一种工具。”（邓小平同志：关于修改党的章程的报告）
    在我国这样地大人多长期落后的国度中进行规模浩大的社会主义建设工作，离开了党的坚强的领导，是不行的，而为了加强党的领导，就必须最充分地发动一切社会力量。
    党的“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，因此，就我现时所能体会到的来说，还不只是为了通过各种互相监督的形式，及时地发现国家工作中的一切缺点，从而不断地改进社会主义建设工作（当然，这也是很重要的。），其实质所在，还在于最充分地发扬人民内部的政治民主，通过各党长期合作和监督的形式，来动员组织人民群众参加国家政治活动，无限地发挥人民群众的政治积极性和政治热情，极大地加强党和国家的领导作用。
    正因如此，我才初步体会到各民主党派无党派民主人士在“长期共存、互相监督”方针下的新的更高的责任，才初步体会到“充分发挥人民政治协商会议和各级协商机构的作用”的迫切意义。
    总之，党的“长期共存、互相监督”的方针的提出，标志着党的人民民主统一战线已经进入一个新的阶段，它意味着国内政治关系有了新的发展。客观形式已经对各民主党派和无党派民主人士提出了更高的责任和要求，学习、体会这一方针是很重要的，从而检查和改进怎样更好地向党学习、更好地联系群众的工作，也是极其重要的事。
