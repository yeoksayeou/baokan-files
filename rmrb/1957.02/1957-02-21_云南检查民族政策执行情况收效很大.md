Yunnan's Inspection of Ethnic Policy Implementation Yields Great Results
The Enthusiasm of Cadres and Minority People is Greatly Enhanced; Public Figures of Minority Nationalities Have Greater Confidence in the Party's Ethnic Policies

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 19th – The comprehensive inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies in Yunnan Province, which began in June of last year, has basically concluded. During the inspection, various localities followed the method advocated by the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China of "inspecting and improving simultaneously." Most started by summarizing the experiences of ethnic work, affirming achievements, criticizing shortcomings, and studying corrective measures to implement. In order to strengthen assistance to ethnic minorities in high-altitude, impoverished mountainous areas, the Provincial Committee convened a special meeting attended by representatives of various ethnic groups to examine and analyze the work in these areas and formulate new work plans. Local and county committees also established Mountain Area Work Committees, led by Party Committee officials, who organized cadres to go deep into the mountains to understand the needs and sufferings of the local ethnic groups and strengthen leadership. After examining and criticizing the shortcomings of generalized leadership in ethnic minority areas during the agricultural collectivization movement, various localities, in conjunction with the autumn rectification of communes, reprocessed the specific policies for ethnic minority communes. They fully respected the voluntary principle of the ethnic groups, adjusted the plans for establishing communes based on the principle of benefiting production development and ethnic unity, and made necessary provisions for the special needs of each ethnic minority. These areas have smoothly completed the transition of communes this spring. With the assistance of the Central Border Region Inspection Group, the Yunnan Provincial Committee systematically studied the new situation after the completion of reform in the border regions. In November of last year, it held a provincial border work conference, which determined the working guidelines for comprehensive development of production and gradual implementation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the border regions. This timely reversed the cadres' impetuous sentiments in the border regions and ensured the active development of winter production. For other shortcomings and errors in policy implementation, similar methods were adopted to correct them gradually during the inspection. Throughout the entire inspection process, various localities also followed the instructions of the Provincial Committee to give full play to democracy, seriously criticize erroneous ideas, and generally not impose disciplinary actions. Therefore, after the inspection, the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and minority people was greatly enhanced, and public figures of minority nationalities deepened their trust in the Party's ethnic policies.

This inspection was carried out under the direct leadership of the Yunnan Provincial Committee. Party and government organs, people's organizations, and People's Liberation Army units stationed in Yunnan systematically inspected the implementation of ethnic policies over the past few years from bottom to top. Various ethnic representative conferences or symposiums were also held to extensively solicit and listen to the opinions and criticisms of ethnic representatives from all strata. During the inspection, the Provincial Committee and most local committees sent special work groups to conduct key inspections. During the comprehensive inspection, deviations that occurred in some areas were quickly corrected under the timely guidance of the Provincial Committee.

The results of the inspection show that due to the firm implementation of the Central Government's guiding principle of "prudence and steady progress" by the Yunnan Provincial Committee, the province's ethnic work has achieved great success in the years since the first inspection of ethnic policy implementation in 1953. Now, the socialist agricultural collectivization has been realized in the mixed ethnic areas of the interior with four million minority people. The land reform through peaceful consultation has been completed successively in the border minority areas with nearly one and a half million people. In other areas with tens of thousands of minority people who will directly transition to socialism without going through the democratic reform movement, the mutual aid and cooperation movement is also gradually developing. The productivity of minority peoples throughout the province has increased year by year, and people's lives have improved to varying degrees. Two million three hundred thousand minority people have realized regional autonomy, and the revolutionary forces of their own ethnic groups have grown considerably. These have laid a good foundation for helping the development of various ethnic minorities and for socialist nations.

The inspections in various localities also showed that neglecting ethnic characteristics, generalized leadership, cadres' complacency, and the work style of doing everything for the people are the main obstacles in Yunnan's ethnic work in recent years. Because some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the de facto inequality caused by historical reasons between ethnic groups, the tendency to neglect ethnic characteristics has grown after the completion of land reform in the interior, and it was even thought that the ethnic issue no longer exists. Therefore, in the agricultural collectivization movement, there was a satisfaction with the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups for socialism, and the special needs of various ethnic minorities were not given due consideration, forcing the establishment of large communes or joint societies, which affected the enthusiasm of ethnic minorities for production. In particular, there was a lack of sufficient assistance for the long-term production and living difficulties of about one million six hundred thousand ethnic minority people living in high-altitude, impoverished mountainous areas. After the completion of democratic reform in the border regions, cadres in some areas did not make a comprehensive analysis of the actual situation of the local ethnic groups and once developed a blind and impetuous sentiment, mechanically applying the experience of the interior, causing some avoidable losses in the work. In places where regional autonomy has been realized, the work of cultivating and improving local minority cadres still lacks more active and effective measures, and the practice of Han cadres doing everything for the people still occurs from time to time. There are also some phenomena of subjectively simple actions and insufficient support in other work such as finance, trade, taxation, culture and education, and health care, regardless of ethnic characteristics and actual conditions. Specific analysis and criticism were made of this situation in the inspection.

Through this inspection, the level of ethnic policy of the vast number of cadres in the province has been significantly improved, and the subjective and doctrinaire work style that deviated from ethnic reality has been further criticized. Now, cadres throughout the province are following the principle of prudence and steady progress, continuing to improve their work style, overcoming great Han chauvinism, and leading the people of all ethnic groups to strive for the completion of socialist transformation and construction. Extensive ethnic policy education will also be strengthened among the broad masses of the people. Individual units where the inspection is not yet thorough are still continuing to conduct inspections.

### 云南检查民族政策执行情况收效很大

    肯定成绩　批判缺点　一边检查　一边改进
    云南检查民族政策执行情况收效很大
    干部和少数民族群众的积极性大为提高　公众领袖人物对党的民族政策更加信赖
    新华社昆明19日电　云南省从去年6月开始的民族政策执行情况的全面检查已经基本结束。在检查过程中，各地遵循中共云南省委员会提倡的“一边检查、一边改进”的方法，大多是从总结民族工作的经验入手，既肯定成绩，又批判缺点，同时研究纠正的办法，付诸实施。为着加强对高寒贫瘠山区少数民族的帮助，省委曾专门召开有各民族代表参加的专业性会议，检查和分析这类地区的工作，制订了新的工作规划；各地委和县委也都先后设立了山区工作委员会，由党委负责人员率领，组织干部，分别深入山区，了解当地民族的需要和疾苦，加强领导。各地在检查和批判了农业合作化运动中对少数民族地区领导一般化的缺点以后，都结合秋后整社重新对少数民族社的具体政策作了处理，充分尊重民族自愿，根据有利于发展生产和有利于民族团结的原则，分别调整了办社的规划，并且对各少数民族的特殊需要作了必要的照顾。这些地区今春已顺利完成转社工作。云南省委还在中央边疆视察组的帮助下，系统研究了边疆完成改革以后的新形势，有准备地在去年11月间召开全省边疆工作会议，确定了边疆全面发展生产和逐步开展互助合作运动的工作方针，及时扭转了边疆干部的急躁情绪，保证了冬季生产的积极开展。对于其它方面执行政策上的缺点和错误，也采取同样的办法，在检查中陆续作了纠正。在整个检查过程中，各地又遵照省委给予的充分发挥民主，严肃地批判错误思想，一般不作纪律处分的指示，因此经过检查以后，干部和少数民族群众的社会主义积极性都大为提高，少数民族公众领袖人物也加深了对党的民族政策的信赖。
    这次检查是在云南省委的直接领导下进行的。全省各级党政机关、人民团体和解放军驻云南部队，都自下而上地对几年来执行民族政策的情况作了系统的检查。并且召开各种民族代表会或座谈会，广泛征求和听取各阶层民族代表人物的意见和批评。在检查期间，省委和多数地委都派出专门的工作组，进行重点检查。在全面检查的过程中，某些地区曾经一度产生的偏差，也在省委的及时指示下迅速得到纠正。
    检查的结果表明：由于云南省委坚决地执行中央“谨慎稳进”的指导方针，从1953年第一次检查民族政策执行情况以后的几年来，全省民族工作又获得很大的成就。现在，内地四百万少数民族杂居地区已经实现社会主义农业合作化，近一百五十万人口的边疆少数民族地区已先后完成和平协商土地改革，其它将不再经过民主改革运动而直接向社会主义过渡的几十万少数民族人口地区，互助合作运动也正在逐步开展。全省少数民族人民的生产力逐年提高，人民生活都有了程度不同的改善。二百三十万少数民族已实现了区域自治，本民族的革命力量有了相当的生长。这些，都为帮助各少数民族发展、为社会主义民族奠定了良好的基础。
    各地的检查也同时表明：忽视民族特点，一般化的领导，干部的自满情绪和包办代替的作风，是近几年来云南民族工作中的主要障碍。由于某些干部对各民族间由历史原因形成的事实上的不平等认识不足，所以在内地完成土地改革以后，忽视民族特点的倾向就有所滋长，甚至以为民族问题已不复存在。因此，在农业合作化运动中，曾经满足于各族人民向往社会主义的热情，对各少数民族的特殊需要没有给予应有的照顾，强求办大社或联合社，以至影响到少数民族生产积极性的发挥，特别是对居住在高寒贫瘠山区的约一百六十万少数民族人民所长期存在的生产和生活上的种种困难，缺乏足够的帮助；在边疆完成民主改革之后，某些地区的干部对当地民族的实际状况作了不够全面的分析，一度发生盲目的急躁情绪，机械搬用内地经验，造成工作中一些原是可以避免的损失。在已经实现区域自治的地方，培养、提高当地少数民族干部的工作也还缺乏更为积极有效的措施，汉族干部的包办代替仍时有表现。其它在财经、贸易、税收、文教、卫生等方面的工作，也存在着若干不顾民族特点和实际条件，主观主义地简单行事和扶持不够的现象。对于这种情况，在检查中都作了具体的分析和批判。
    通过这次检查，全省广大干部的民族政策水平得到显著提高，若干脱离民族实际的主观主义思想作风受到进一步的批判。现在全省干部正遵循谨慎稳进的方针，继续改进作风，克服大民族主义思想，领导各族人民为完成社会主义改造和建设而努力。在广大人民群众中，也将加强广泛的民族政策教育。个别检查还不深刻的单位，还在继续进行检查。
