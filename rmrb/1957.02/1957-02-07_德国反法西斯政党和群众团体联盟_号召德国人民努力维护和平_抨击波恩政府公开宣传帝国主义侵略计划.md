Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 6th. The German Anti-Fascist Parties and Mass Organizations Alliance passed a declaration at a meeting held on the 5th, calling on all good people in Germany to be vigilant and jointly fight to safeguard peace.

    Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister, and Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber, all spoke at the meeting discussing the declaration.

    The declaration pointed out that while the German Democratic Republic is making every effort to guarantee peace, the West German government is openly promoting the aggressive plans of German imperialism. The Bonn government's foreign policy statement and the speeches made by members of Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union in the Bonn Bundestag on February 1 are evidence of this propaganda.

    The declaration called on the people of the German Democratic Republic to use all their strength to consolidate their worker-peasant state—a strong fortress for ensuring peace and security and striving for unification. In the declaration, the alliance expressed its willingness to consult with all peace forces in West Germany on common measures against conscription laws.

    德国反法西斯政党和群众团体联盟
    号召德国人民努力维护和平
    抨击波恩政府公开宣传帝国主义侵略计划
    新华社柏林6日电　民主德国反法西斯政党和群众团体联盟在五日举行的会议上通过宣言，号召全德国的善良人民提高警惕，共同为维护和平而斗争。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、副总理努舍克和人民议院主席狄克曼等人都在讨论宣言的会议上讲了话。
    宣言指出：正当德意志民主共和国为保障和平而竭尽一切努力的时候，西德政府却在公然宣传德国帝国主义的侵略计划。波恩政府的外交政策声明和阿登纳的基督教民主联盟的议员们2月1日在波恩联邦议会里的发言，就是这种宣传的证据。
    宣言号召德意志民主共和国人民用一切力量来巩固自己的工农国家——保障和平安全和争取统一的强固堡垒。联盟在宣言中表示愿意同西德一切和平力量协商反对兵役法的共同措施。
