	Found Fortune in the Trash Heap
	In the past, the Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory dealt with workshop garbage in the same way as many other factories, which was to hire people to transport it out. Because there was a lot of wealth in the garbage, the haulers had a great advantage, and many people competed to transport it. Some people were even willing to transport the garbage without pay. These facts aroused the attention of the comrades in charge of recycling at this factory, and they hired a temporary worker to wash the garbage. Although the factory is not large in scale, consuming less than 200 tons of non-ferrous metals and only more than 600 tons of ferrous metals annually, in the four months from September to the end of last year, this factory had already sifted out a large amount of useful materials: 348 kilograms of solder, 3,663 kilograms of scrap steel and iron filings, 453 kilograms of non-ferrous metal filings, and some tools, oily cotton yarn, protective equipment, etc., worth a total of 3,458 yuan.

    垃圾堆里找到了财富
    上海电焊机厂过去对车间垃圾的处理办法，和其他许多工厂一样，也是雇人外运。由于垃圾内有不少财富，拉运人员有很大好处，许多人都争着来运，有人还愿意不要工钱，负责运送垃圾。这些事实引起了这个厂负责回收工作的同志的注意，他们雇了一名临时工人来淘洗垃圾。虽然这个厂生产规模不大，全年消耗有色金属不到二百吨，消耗黑色金属仅六百多吨，但是，这个厂在去年9月到年底的四个月内，就淘出了大量有用的物资：焊锡三百四十八公斤，废钢、铁屑三千六百六十三公斤，有色金属屑四百五十三公斤，以及一些工具、油棉纱、防护用品等，共值三千四百五十八元。　　唐焜
