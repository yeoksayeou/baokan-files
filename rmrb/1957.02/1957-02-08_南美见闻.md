	Fervent "Samba" Dance

	The "Dajia Kan" newspaper, run by the writer Amado, and the Brazilian football club, two groups with a huge influence and status in the local cultural and sports life, jointly invited Chinese artists. After the social gathering, we also enjoyed a splendid performance by Brazilian artists.

	The harmonica player performed on a simple instrument to produce different timbres, volumes, and effects. The ventriloquist ruthlessly satirized speakers who made empty speeches but struck poses for the cameras. It was rare that many artists came specifically after the end of their theater performances; some rescheduled their already announced performances, and some even rushed from cities hundreds of kilometers away. The young female soloist Sterlinga Eiger sang several folk songs with completely different styles, full of a strong sense of life. Among them, the song of the poor old woman who went mad after losing her children and the song of the street vendor were particularly poignant. The most famous folk song soloist, Silvio Caldas, sang many beautiful love songs, showing the touching lyrical nature of Brazilian folk songs. The most profound impression on us was the song and dance performance by the Brazilian People's Theater.

	The main members of the Brazilian People's Theater are black, but according to Mr. Trinidad, the director of the theater, the programs they perform, even the purely African Congo dances, are completely different in form and content. Therefore, he believes that their dances are not only the dances of Brazilian blacks but a synthesis of the dance art of all Brazilian peoples—Portuguese, African blacks, and local Indians. As for the age of these dances, he said it might be one or two hundred years.

	Among the programs we saw, the most impressive were three: one was "Samba," or a group dance based on Samba rhythms, the frenzied rhythm made the dancers seem like spirits possessed by gods and demons, fervently and devoutly dancing every part of their bodies. I say every part of the body, and this is by no means an exaggeration; from the head to the tips of the fingers, everything trembled with the beat. The dancers' superb technique made every part of their bodies magically match the complex and varied rhythms of the music. In this dance, we can see the dancer's entire body and mind released, intoxicated, and ardent.

	Another is "Frevo." This is a partner dance, and one can clearly see the traces of the combination of the European "contra dance" and South American-style music rhythms, body movements, and steps. This is one of the main dance forms in the traditional Rio de Janeiro Carnival.

	The third is called "Maracatu." This dance is a variation of the African Congo local festival group dance and is also a crystallization of African and South American dance and musical culture. The content is a festival parade, where the god who drives away the plague finally defeats the enemy chariot of the plague ghosts. The ghosts and gods all wear masks, and the modeling is very moving.

	Perhaps some people have bad associations from the later jazz music, and because dances like "Samba" have been exaggerated in Hollywood movies, even fabricated, these impressions make it difficult for us to recognize the original appearance of these South American dances. But if we look at them carefully, we can find how strongly and truly these dances express the passionate, strong, and brave character, endless vitality, and love and pursuit of life of the Brazilian people, especially the people of northern Brazil, the origin of these dances.

	Just as all folk dances often have a competitive nature, South American dances require the dancer to have abundant energy and giant-like physical strength. We also saw a "Samba Competition Dance," where every new dancer must exhaust their male opponent, gradually speeding up the rhythm, and unexpectedly trip the opponent to the ground with their feet. However, the posture of falling to the ground varies from person to person, either heroic and neat or funny and absurd, but once they fall, they will definitely rise up and continue to dance wildly in the dance team. --This really requires extraordinary energy.

    南美见闻	赵沨
    狂热的“桑巴”舞
    作家亚马多主持的“大家看”报社和巴西的足球俱乐部，这两个在当地文化和体育生活中有着巨大影响和地位的团体，联合邀请了中国艺术家们。在联欢酒会以后，还欣赏了巴西艺术家表演的精采节目。
    口琴家把简单的乐器演奏到具有不同的音色、音量和效果。口技家把演说词空洞无物、但却为摄影而卖弄姿态的演说家挖苦得淋漓尽致。难得的是许多艺术家是在剧场表演终了后特地赶来参加的，有的把原已公布的演出改了期，有的甚至从数百公里外的城市专门赶来。青年女独唱家斯特琳娜·艾格演唱了风格完全不同的几首民歌，充满了强烈的生活气息。其中，因失去儿女而疯狂的穷老太婆的歌和叫卖小贩的歌更是凄厉动人。最负盛名的民歌独唱家薛尔微欧·卡尔达斯唱了许多优美的情歌，表现了巴西民歌的感人的抒情性质的一面。给我们以最深刻的印象的，还是巴西人民剧院表演的歌舞。
    巴西人民剧院的主要成员是黑人，但据这个剧院的院长特利达德先生告诉我，他们所表演的节目中，即便是纯粹的非洲刚果的舞蹈，形式和内容也完全不同了。因而他认为，他们的舞蹈不仅是巴西黑人的舞蹈，而是巴西各民族人民——葡萄牙人、非洲黑人、当地的印第安人的舞蹈艺术的综合。至于这些舞蹈形成的年代，据他说可能有一、二百年了。
    我们看到的节目中，印象最深的有三个：一个是“桑巴”，或者叫做根据桑巴节奏的群舞，如狂的节奏使舞者简直像身上附了神魔的精灵一样，狂热而虔诚地舞动身体的每一个部分。我说身体的每一部分，这绝不夸张，从头到手指的末梢都随着节拍颤动着。舞者高超的技术使身体的每个部分都神奇地吻合着音乐复杂、变化多端的节奏。在这个舞蹈里，我们可以看到舞者的整个身心的解脱、沉醉和热诚。
    另一个是“伏列沃”。这是一种对舞，可以明显地看出欧洲的“对舞”和南美风格的音乐节奏和身段、步法相结合的痕迹。这在里约热内卢的传统的狂欢节中，是最主要的舞蹈形式之一。
    第三个叫“玛拉长图”，这个舞蹈是非洲刚果地方节日群舞的变形，也同样是非洲和南美舞蹈、音乐文化的结晶。内容是节日的游行，驱疫病的神终于战败了疫鬼的敌车，鬼神们都带着面具，造型很是动人。
    也许有的人从后期的爵士音乐带来些坏的联想，更由于像“桑巴”这类的舞蹈曾被好莱坞的影片加上许多夸张，以至无中生有的渲染，这些印象使我们难以认识这些南美舞蹈的本来面貌。但认真地看一看，我们便能发现这些舞蹈多么强烈而又真实地表现了巴西人民，特别是这些舞蹈发源地的巴西北部人民那种热情、强烈、勇敢的性格，无尽的生命力以及对生活的热爱和追求。
    正像所有的民间舞蹈常有竞技的性质一样，南美舞蹈更需要舞者的充沛的精力和巨人般的体力。我们还看到一个“桑巴竞技舞”，每一个新来的舞者一定要把另一个男性的对手在节奏逐渐加快的情况下，使对方精疲力竭，出其不意地用脚把对手拌倒在地下。但摔倒地下的姿态因人而异，或英武利落或滑稽突梯，但一摔下来也必定勃然而起，又参加到舞队中继续狂舞下去。——这真的需要过人的精力。
