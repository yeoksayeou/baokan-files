    People's Teacher
    Li Man
    In October last year, I got a pimple on my face. Although it didn't hurt much, it was quite uncomfortable, so I decided to go to the hospital.

    As I walked to the public-funded medical clinic entrance, I saw someone with a limp going in. After registering and waiting in the surgery room, I saw him there too. There were many people waiting for treatment. I found a newspaper to read while I waited. After about half an hour, I looked up and saw the limping man being examined. The doctor greeted him very politely.

    "Haven't you taken sick leave yet?" the doctor asked him with a reproachful tone.

    "My brain and mouth aren't sick, why would I take leave?"

    "Oh! To insist on teaching even with such a serious condition is admirable, but the illness will take longer to heal," the doctor said with admiration and pity. "A longer time is better than delaying the students' studies."

    A few questions and answers caught my attention. I stood up and moved closer to see what illness he had. It turned out that both his arms and legs were covered in bandages. The doctor asked him that because he saw that the bandages were coming off. After the nurse removed the bandages and dressings, I could clearly see that his skin was covered with small blisters, the larger ones like green beans, the smaller ones like millet. The dense large blisters looked like a hornet's nest, and the small ones like silkworm moth eggs, making me almost afraid to look anymore. After the doctor wrote the prescription, the nurse changed his dressing. Then it was my turn to be treated. I couldn't help but say:

    "Comrade, wait for me after you change your dressing, I have something to say to you."

    He looked up at me, showing a surprised expression. He probably thought that two strangers wouldn't have anything to talk about, but he didn't refuse.

    Who knew that after I finished my treatment, he hadn't finished changing his dressing yet. I waited for him for half an hour. He spent a full hour changing his dressing.

    We went out of the surgery room, and he said, "What did you want to say?" I said, "Let's talk at the gate!" When we got to the gate, I asked him how he was going to get home. He said he would walk.

    "I want to support you and send you back, that's what I wanted to say."

    "How can I do that! Thank you, I can walk. I walked here by myself."

    I pointed to the pedicab at the gate and said, "Otherwise, I'll call a pedicab to take you back."

    "That's even more out of the question." He seemed to mean, "How dare I trouble you, since we've only just met?"

    "I'm too moved by you. Don't be polite, I'm going to send you back anyway." His firm attitude was met with my firm attitude, and in a helpless situation, he had to choose the former method.

    I supported him as we walked slowly, and asked him about his illness. He first introduced himself as a teacher at the No. 2 Middle School, and then said that he had eczema. This disease is a skin condition that causes small blisters, oozes yellow fluid, and is extremely itchy. When it itches, it's excruciating, and you have to scratch until it hurts. He said that during the day, when he focused on teaching, he didn't feel it so much, but at night it was terrible. He said he needed one or two hours to fall asleep in bed.

    "You're in so much pain!" I interrupted him.

    "You're only half right. My body is in pain, but my spirit is very happy." He looked more radiant than before. I didn't quite understand what he meant. He saw my doubt and explained:

    "At that time, I think of my students and the words of comfort they said to me when they saw me. They told me to rest well, and that they would repay my persistence in teaching with a high level of enthusiasm for learning. I was moved to tears by their sincere and concerned attitude. I forgot the pain, and I was happy. This encouraged my enthusiasm for work even more. Not only have I not taken leave since I got sick in September, but I won't take leave in the future either." I advised him that he should rest and take care of his body so that he could work better. He looked into my eyes and said: The task is so heavy, the teachers in the same school are already burdened enough, how can I let them take my classes for a long time? And I can't find a replacement outside the school, and even if I found one, I wouldn't be at ease. Then he repeated what he had said to the doctor. Finally, he said that his way of dealing with this chronic disease was to treat it well during the holidays.

    He became more and more excited as he talked, and he walked with energy, as if he wasn't sick at all. But my eyes were filled with two glittering tears, about to fall.

    去年10月间我脸上生了一个粉刺，虽然不很疼，可是十分难受，去医院治治吧。
    走到公费治疗门诊部门口，我见一个一步一跛的人进去了。我挂了号到外科室候诊时，见他也在那儿。看病的人很多，我找到一张报纸看着候诊，等了约半点钟，我抬头看了一下，那个跛脚的人就诊了。医生很客气地向他打了一声招呼。
    “你还没请假休息吗？”医生带着责备的口气问了他一声。
    “我的脑子和嘴都没有病，干么请假？”
    “唉呀！身体坏到这样严重程度，还坚持上课，这种精神是可贵的，不过病要好得慢一些。”医生钦佩又怜惜地说。“时间长总比耽误学生的功课强。”
    几句问答引起了我的注意。我站起身往前凑了凑，要看他得的什么病。原来他的两只胳臂和腿都扎满了绷带，医生看见绷带都脱落了才那样问他的。护士把绷带和敷料都去掉后，我清楚地看到，他皮肤上生了很多小水泡，大的像绿豆，小的像小米。密集的大水泡像马蜂窝，小的像蚕蛾下的子，使我几乎再不敢看下去。医生处方后，护士给他换药。下边该给我治病了。我情不自禁地说：
    “同志，你换了药等我一等，我有话跟你说。”
    他抬头瞟了我一眼，现出诧异的神情。大概觉得两个素不相识的人有什么话可说呢，但他也没有表示拒绝。
    谁知我治罢了病，他还没换完药，我倒等了他半点钟。他换药足足用了一个钟头的时间。
    我俩出了外科室，他说：“你有什么话请说吧！”我说：“到大门口再说吧！”到了大门口，我问他怎样回去，他说步行回去。
    “我要搀着你把你送回去，这就是我要说的话。”
    “那怎么能行呢！谢谢你，我能走。我来的时候就是自个儿步行的。”
    我指着门口的三轮车说：“不然我就叫辆三轮送你回去。”
    “那更不行。”他大有“萍水相逢怎敢讨扰”的意思。
    “我太被你感动了。你不要客气了，反正我要送你回去。”他的坚决的态度被我的坚决的态度顶回去了，在无可奈何的情况下他只好选择了前一个方法。
    我一面扶着他慢慢地走，一面问他关于害病的一些情况。他先自我介绍了他在二中教学，接着就说他害的是湿疹病。这种病是一种皮肤病，出小泡，流黄水，发奇痒，痒起来钻心，非抓到发疼不止。他说白天把思想集中在教学上还不觉得怎样，可是一到晚上就糟糕了，钻进被窝里总要挨一两个钟头才能入眠。
    “你太痛苦了！”我打断他的话插上一句。
    “你只说对了一半。我的身体是痛苦的，我的精神却很愉快。”他比刚才的神情焕发了。我却不很理解他这句话的意思。他看出我有怀疑，就解释说：
    “我一到那时候就想起我的学生们看我的时候所说的安慰我的话来。他们让我好好的休息，他们要以高度的学习热情来报答我的坚持上课。我被他们诚挚而关切的态度感动得流过泪，我忘记了痛苦，我愉快。也就因为这更鼓励了我坚持工作的热情。我不但从9月害病到现在没有请假，以后我还不请假。”我劝他，还是应该休息一下，养好了身体也是为了更好地工作。他看着我的眼说：任务这么繁重，同校的教师本身负担就够了，怎好长期代课；校外又找不到代理人，即使找到我还不放心呢。接着他又把对医生说的话重述了一遍。最后他说他对付这种慢性病的办法是趁假期好好治疗。
    他越谈越兴奋，走路也有劲了，好像没有病一样。可是我的两眼里却含着两颗晶莹的泪珠，闪闪欲坠。
