Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd Dispatch from Washington: The talks between Saudi Arabian King Saud and Eisenhower concluded on February 1st. Staff members from both sides are continuing to study certain practical issues concerning bilateral relations.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles vaguely discussed the Saudi-Eisenhower talks on February 1st. He said that Saud had “a better understanding” of the “Eisenhower Doctrine.” Regarding the question of extending the lease for the U.S. air force base in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, Dulles said that there had not yet been any "technical discussions." The Associated Press reported that Saud has not yet agreed to this matter thus far. Dulles also mentioned that economic "aid" might be provided to Saudi Arabia through the World Bank.

Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd Dispatch: Some American newspapers, commenting on the Saudi-Eisenhower talks, believe that the large American oil companies operating in the Middle East are playing a significant role in the negotiations.

American newspaper commentaries also point out that the negotiations with the Saudi King are not developing within the scope originally hoped for by Washington, and are not proceeding as smoothly as American officials had desired. For example, "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Higgins wrote: "King Saud made it clear to Mr. Eisenhower and his assistants that any talk of separating one Arab country from another only demonstrates a great lack of understanding of the current situation. King Saud emphasized that, despite differences in internal systems, the Middle East is united by a common determination to develop its own national independence and freedom from foreign interference."

    沙特同艾森豪威尔会谈结束
    延长扎赫兰基地租约问题仍未解决
    美报承认分化阿拉伯国家的阴谋碰了壁
    据新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：沙特阿拉伯国王沙特和艾森豪威尔的会谈2月1日结束。双方工作人员还在继续研究双方关系方面的某些实际问题。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯1日含糊地谈论了沙特和艾森豪威尔的会谈情况。他说，沙特对“艾森豪威尔主义”“有了更好的了解”。谈到是否延长美国在沙特阿拉伯扎赫兰的空军基地的租约问题时，杜勒斯说，还没有进行过“技术方面的商谈”。美联社消息说，沙特直到现在为止还没有就这个问题表示同意。杜勒斯还谈到，可能通过世界银行来对沙特阿拉伯提供经济“援助”。
    据新华社2日讯　美国一些报纸在评论沙特和艾森豪威尔会谈时，认为在中东经营的美国大石油公司在谈判中起着重大作用。
    美国报刊的评论同时指出，同沙特国王的谈判不是在华盛顿原先希望的那个范围内发展的，并且进行得没有如美国官方人士所想望的那样顺利。例如，“纽约先驱论坛报”记者希金斯写道：“沙特国王明确地向艾森豪威尔先生及艾森豪威尔的助理们指出，想使一个阿拉伯国家脱离另一个阿拉伯国家的任何谈话，只足以证明十分不了解当前局势。沙特国王着重说，尽管内部制度各有不同，然而中东是由发展自己的民族独立、不受外力干涉的共同决心团结在一起的”。
