Streamlining Institutions Must Be Combined with System Reform
This is How Wuhan Retail Company is Being Reorganized
By Our Reporter Zhang Wei

Organizational Overlap and Redundant Personnel; Excessive Centralization of Power at the Top

Wuhan Retail Company has three levels of organization: the Municipal Company, the District Company, and grassroots stores. Before the reorganization and system reform, the Municipal Company had nine sections and one office. Some sections, such as the Price Section, did not need to be established independently based on the actual work situation, but they were set up separately to "align" with the structure of the Commercial Bureau. The subordinate District Companies also blindly followed the Municipal Company and set up the same number of sections and offices. The entire system had 2,633 employees, of which 930 were administrative management personnel, averaging about one administrative person for every two and a half employees. The large organization and excessive administrative management personnel led to redundancy. Some people could complete their work in just two hours each day. They constantly requested the leaders to increase their workload, but because there was nothing to add, the leaders had to advise them to use their free time to study more. The power of enterprise management was also excessively concentrated in the Municipal and District Companies. From the organization of commodity sources to the distribution and storage of commodities, specific business operations were all handled by the District Companies. All expenses of the stores also had to be approved and reimbursed by the District Companies. The grassroots stores only sold goods. This greatly affected the enthusiasm of the grassroots stores, often leading to artificial out-of-stock situations and stockpiles. Many store directors said, "I have the title but no power." At the same time, the excessive and complicated reports and statements stipulated by the Municipal Company also increased the burden on the grassroots.

Regarding the above situation, Wuhan Retail Company had attempted to improve it through previous streamlining efforts. However, because each time they simply closed the door and engaged in streamlining staffing levels without reforming the system, some sections bargained when streamlining personnel and couldn't reduce staff; some sections, although they streamlined personnel, soon recovered.

Mobilizing the Masses to Conduct "Four Checks"; Formulating a Practical Reorganization Plan

In October 1956, under the leadership of the Second Commercial Bureau of the city, the Municipal Retail Company learned from the past lessons of closed-door reorganization and earnestly mobilized the masses to implement the principle of combining streamlining staffing levels with system reform.

At the beginning, they mobilized the masses to conduct "four checks," namely, checking the specific situation of the large organizational structure, checking the specific situation of the bloated personnel, checking the specific situation of the centralized authority, and checking the specific situation of the complex reporting system. Through the "four checks," the masses exposed many problems that the leadership had not discovered. The leadership further realized the seriousness of the situation and that reorganization and system reform were imperative. Then, they mobilized the masses to calculate accounts: How many personnel need to be streamlined? How many reports need to be reduced? Which organizational structures can be merged? Which powers can be delegated? The leadership listened carefully to the criticisms of the masses and accepted the correct opinions. When the masses discussed whether the Financial Accounting Section and the Planning Statistics Section of the Municipal Company could be merged, some people believed that the two sections should not be merged because they each had independent characteristics and separate settings would facilitate business research. Others advocated merging them, saying that the three major plans of expenses, profits, and commodity circulation were interrelated, but in the past, they were drafted separately by two sections, resulting in many disconnections. At the same time, the three major plans could not be issued simultaneously, which caused difficulties for the lower levels. If the two sections were merged into one section, this situation could be changed, and the staff of the two sections could also be reduced by half. After full discussion, the leadership adopted the latter opinion and explained to everyone the benefits of merging the two sections, so that everyone's thinking reached a consensus. Because the reorganization and system reform plan was formulated after the masses' calculations and discussions, the masses were relatively satisfied.

Merging Institutions, Simplifying Forms and Reports; Delegating Power, Transferring Personnel Downward

In this reorganization and system reform plan, it was stipulated that the nine sections and one office of the Municipal Company should be merged into five sections and one office, and the sections and offices of the District Companies should also be merged according to the situation. The staff of the Municipal and District Companies was also reduced from 678 to 312. The reports from the District Companies to the Municipal Company were reduced from sixteen to six, and the report forms were simplified from fifty-one to seventeen. In terms of the management system, the past accounting system of 155 grassroots stores (including stalls) to seven District Companies was changed to implement an independent economic accounting system. In addition, according to the principle of delegating power, the functions and powers of the Municipal, District, and grassroots stores were divided.

When fully mobilizing the masses to implement this reorganization and system reform plan, some comrades (mainly comrades from the district-level companies) were afraid that delegating power and implementing independent accounting for grassroots stores would disrupt the supply work and did not dare to implement it boldly. The Municipal Company then selected the Sixth Central Store in Qiaokou District as a pilot for implementing independent accounting. After the Sixth Central Store implemented independent accounting, its business enthusiasm was greatly stimulated, its commodity turnover increased, its expenses decreased, and its losses were also reduced. Originally, the price reduction loss of the Sixth Central Store reached 884 yuan in 20 days, but now it has been reduced to 271 yuan compared with the same period. After gaining experience through the pilot, the manager of the Qiaokou District Company introduced it to the district companies, and the managers of the district companies also took the initiative to visit and learn from the Sixth Central Store, which increased their confidence. A total of 94 accounting points were established in 155 grassroots stores and stalls in the city (some stores near stalls adopted the method of "large stores leading small stores" as an accounting point), and independent economic accounting was implemented in two batches.

Now, the reorganization and system reform work of the Municipal Retail Company has achieved remarkable results. By the end of December 1956, 189 administrative personnel had been transferred to work in grassroots stores, of which 104 served as salespersons and purchasers in stores, and 85 served as directors or accountants in stores. Zhang Denggui was originally a director of a grassroots store who was familiar with the business. In 1955, he was transferred to the Municipal Company to engage in administrative work. Now, he is the director of a retail store in Qingshan District. After arriving at the store, he first mobilized the masses to find out that the reason why the store had more than 300 yuan of errors in its business every month was that the system was unsound. He strengthened the audit system and personally audited the accounts, eliminating the errors. Most of the personnel who went to the stores as accountants were skilled accountants from the Municipal Company or District Companies. After they arrived at the stores, they quickly helped the original accountants of the stores to sort out the accounts and changed the chaotic situation of the accounts.

After streamlining the institutions and reports, the responsible persons of the Municipal and District Companies and the comrades of the business guidance departments, under the slogan of "serving the grassroots and serving the business," often went deep into the lower levels. Even the comrades of the Finance and Planning Section, who were so entangled in the reports in the past that they could not leave the office at all, went to the stores to check the final accounts of 1956. Fourteen responsible staff members, including the manager and section chiefs of the Jianghan District Company, started from January 17 this year and went to the 18 grassroots stores and five larger joint state-private stores under their jurisdiction to study with the employees how to carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign, and promptly solve the problems in the Spring Festival supply.

After implementing independent economic accounting for grassroots stores and delegating power, each grassroots store can directly purchase goods. At the same time, the stores established settlement relationships with banks, reducing settlement links, and the stores' sales proceeds of the day could be used for turnover. In addition, the stores adopted the method of quick in and quick sale to purchase goods according to the sales situation, which greatly accelerated the turnover of funds and saved working capital. For example, the Second Store of West Street in Hanyang District used to have a commodity fund of 23,000 yuan, but now only 15,000 yuan is enough.

Increased Enthusiasm of Grassroots Personnel; Commodity Supply Work Begins to Improve

After the system was reformed in this way, the enthusiasm of the staff of the grassroots stores was greatly increased, and the work has been greatly improved. The Huangshi Road Store in Jiang'an District originally operated 780 varieties, but now it has added more than 100 varieties such as candied fruit, preserved plum, sour plum, butter, and various seafood according to the needs of the masses. In December last year, Wuhan Food Factory purchased 30 jin of frozen powder from them. The store did not have it, and the purchaser immediately went to the Aquatic Products Company to buy it for them. The supply of fresh pork on the market was very small, and the varieties of braised dishes organized by them from the Meat Joint Processing Plant were not many. The salesperson of the braised dish counter tried to buy a large amount of fresh beef to make braised beef for supply, which was very popular among consumers. Dozens of kilograms could be sold every day, sometimes up to 100 kilograms. They also bought fresh fish to make smoked fish, and bought dried bean curd to make braised dried bean curd for sale, which appropriately met the needs of the masses. In November 1956, the store began to implement independent accounting, and the turnover for that month reached more than 46,000 yuan, which was more than 2,000 yuan more than in October. The turnover in December reached more than 59,000 yuan, which was larger than the turnover in any month of the whole year, even more than in February 1956 (which was the Spring Festival last year) by more than 1,000 yuan. The turnover in the first half of January this year has reached more than 30,000 yuan. They also carefully calculated and saved expenses everywhere. Originally, they hired tricycles to pull fruits, which cost 4 jiao per trip, and they had to pull five or six trips a day. This expense was reported to the District Company and it was over. Now, they tried to use the car in their own store to deliver goods to the canteens of the organs to pull fruits, saving 60 to 70 yuan per month.

Recently, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its "Instructions on Reforming Work Methods, Systems, and Institutions," specifically mentioned their experience in reorganization and system reform, and called on all units to earnestly learn and promote it.

    精简机构要同改革制度结合
    武汉市零售公司就是这样进行整编的
    本报记者　张碨
    机构重叠人浮于事  上边权力过分集中
    武汉市零售公司有市公司、区公司和基层商店三级组织。在整编改制以前，市公司设有九科一室，其中有些科，例如物价科，根据实际工作情况不需要单独设立，但为了和商业局的机构对“口”，也单独设立了科；所属区公司也盲目跟着市公司设置了同样多的课室。整个系统有职工二千六百三十三人，其中行政管理人员就有九百三十人，平均约两个半人中有一个行政人员。庞大的机构和过多的行政管理人员形成了人浮于事的情况。有些人的工作，每天只要用两小时就可以作完，他们不断请求领导方面增加工作量，但因为无事可加，领导上只好劝他们利用空闲时间多多学习。企业管理的权力也过分集中在市、区公司，从商品货源的组织到商品的分配、保管等具体业务都由区公司包揽，商店的一切开支也都要经过区公司批准、报销，基层商店只是出售商品。这样便大大影响了基层商店的积极性，往往造成人为的脱销和积压现象，许多商店主任说：“我有职无权。”同时，市公司规定的过多过繁的报告和报表也加重了基层的负担。
    对于以上情况，武汉市零售公司也曾经企图通过历次精简工作加以改善；但是，因为每次他们都只是几个领导人员关起门来单纯搞精简编制，没有改革制度，结果，有的科室精简人员时讨价还价，精简不下去；有的科室虽然精简了人员，但不久又恢复起来。
    发动群众进行“四查”  制定切实的整编方案
    1956年10月，市零售公司在第二商业局领导下，吸取了过去关门整编的教训，认真发动群众，贯彻执行了整顿编制和改革制度相结合的方针。
    开始，他们发动群众进行“四查”，即检查组织机构庞大的具体情况，检查人员臃肿的具体情况、检查权限集中的具体情况、检查报表制度繁杂的具体情况。通过“四查”，群众揭发了许多领导上没有发现的问题。领导方面进一步认识到情况严重，非进行整编改制不可。接着，他们又发动群众算账：需要精简多少人员？需要减少多少报表？组织机构哪些可以合并？哪些权限可以下放？领导上认真地听取了群众的批评，接受了正确的意见。在群众讨论市公司财务会计科和计划统计科是否可以合并时，有的人认为两个科不应合并，因为两者各有独立的性质，分开设置便于钻研业务；有的人主张合并，他们说费用、利润和商品流转三大计划是互相关联的，但过去却分别由两个科拟定，结果发生许多脱节现象；同时，三大计划不能同时下达，便给下边造成工作困难。如果两个科合并为一个科，就可以改变这种情况，两个科的人员还可以减少一半。经过充分讨论，领导上采纳了后者的意见，向大家说清楚两科合并的好处，使大家的思想取得一致。因为经过群众的算账和讨论，整编改制的方案制订出来以后，群众是比较满意的。
    合并机构简化表报  权力下放人员下调
    在这次整编改制方案中，规定将市公司的九科一室合并成为五科一室，各区公司的课室也根据情况加以合并。市、区公司的工作人员也由六百七十八人减少为三百一十二人。区公司向市公司的报告由十六种减为六种，报表由五十一种简化为十七种。在经营管理制度方面，也将一百五十五个基层商店（包括摊亭）过去向七个区公司的报账制度改为实行独立经济核算制。另外，还根据权力下放的原则，划分了市、区和基层商店的职权。
    在全面发动群众贯彻这个整编改制方案时，有些同志（主要是区级公司的同志）怕权力下放和基层商店实行独立核算，会把供应工作搞乱了，不敢大胆实行。市公司又选择礄口区第六中心商店作为实行独立核算的试点。第六中心商店实行独立核算后，经营积极性大大发挥起来，商品流转额扩大，费用降低，损耗也减少了。原来第六中心商店在二十天中，商品的削价损耗即达八百八十四元，现在和同时期相比，已降低为二百七十一元。通过试点取得经验后，即由礄口区公司经理向各区公司作了介绍，各区公司经理也主动到第六中心店里参观、学习，提高了信心。全市一百五十五个基层商店和摊亭，共建立了九十四个核算点（有些商店附近有摊亭就采取以大带小的办法作为一个核算点），先后分两批实行了独立的经济核算。
    现在，市零售公司的整编改制工作已经取得显著成绩。到1956年12月底，已经有一百八十九个行政人员被调到基层商店工作，其中有一百零四人担任了商店的营业员、采购员，有八十五人担任了商店的主任或会计。张登贵原来是一个熟悉业务的基层商店的主任，1955年被调到市公司搞行政工作。现在，又到青山区零售商店当主任。到商店以后，他首先发动群众找出这个商店每月营业上都差错三百多元的原因是制度不健全，便加强了审核制度，亲自审核账目，消灭了差错。下到商店担任会计的人员，大部分都是市公司或区公司的熟练的会计人员，他们到了商店之后，也迅速帮助原来商店的会计人员清理了账目，改变了账目混乱的情况。
    在精简机构和表报以后，市、区公司的负责人员和业务指导部门的同志在“为基层服务、为业务服务”的口号下，经常深入下层，连过去被表报缠住身子根本无法离开办公室的财务计划科的同志，也下到商店检查1956年的年终决算。江汉区公司的经理、课长等十四名负责工作人员，从今年1月17日开始，分别到所属的十八个基层商店及五家较大的公私合营商店里，和职工们一起研究如何开展增产节约运动，并及时解决春节供应中的问题。
    在实行基层商店独立经济核算和权力下放以后，各基层商店都可以直接采购货物。同时，商店和银行建立了结算关系，减少了结算环节，商店当日的销售款即可用来周转；再加上商店根据销售情况采取快进快卖的办法进货，便大大加速了资金的周转，节省了流动资金。例如，汉阳区西大街第二商店过去商品资金得二万三千元，现在只要一万五千元就够了。
    基层人员的积极性提高  商品供应工作开始改进
    这样改革制度以后，基层商店工作人员的积极性大大提高了，工作也有了很大改进。江岸区黄石路商店原来经营的品种有七百八十种，现在又根据群众的需要，增加了蜜饯、话梅、酸梅、黄油和各种海味等一百多种。去年12月间，武汉食品工厂向他们购买冻粉三十斤，商店里没有，采购员马上到水产公司替他们买到了。市面上鲜猪肉的供应很少，他们从肉类联合加工厂组织来的卤菜种类也不多，卤菜柜营业员便设法大量购买鲜牛肉来作卤牛肉供应，很受消费者欢迎，每天可出售好几十斤，有时达一百斤。他们还买鲜鱼作成熏鱼，买千张皮作成卤千张卖，这都适当地满足了群众的需要。1956年11月，这个商店开始实行独立核算，当月的营业额便达四万六千多元，比10月份多二千来元，12月份营业额达到了五万九千多元，比全年任何一个月的营业额都大，甚至比1956年2月份（正是去年春节）还多一千多元。今年1月份半个月的营业额已达三万多元。他们还处处精打细算，节约费用。原来雇三轮车拉水果，每趟花四角，每天要拉五、六趟，这笔费用向区公司一报账就完了。现在，他们设法用自己商店里给机关伙食团送货的车子拉水果，每月节省六、七十元。
    最近，中共武汉市委在“关于改革工作方法、制度、机构的指示”中，特别提到了他们整编改制的经验，号召各单位认真学习和推广。
