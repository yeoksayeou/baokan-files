    Zhuang Farmers Welcome Mountain Walking Plow
    (Our Newspaper News) The Baise Agricultural Machinery Factory in Baise Prefecture, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has successfully imitated and produced a mountain walking plow, and has begun small-scale production.
    86% of the villages in Baise Prefecture are rocky and hilly areas. In December last year, in order to adapt to the characteristics of mountainous areas, the Baise Agricultural Machinery Factory solicited farmers' opinions and specially manufactured a mountain-type plow for farmers in mountainous areas. This mountain walking plow can not only plow paddy fields, but also plow small plots of hard soil on slopes and stony swidden fields, which is very popular among farmers.

    僮族农民欢迎山地步犁
    本报讯　广西省桂西僮族自治州百色地区百色农业机械厂仿制山地步犁成功，并已开始小批生产。
    百色地区86％的乡是石山区和土山区。去年12月，百色农业机械厂为了适应山区特点，征求农民意见，专门为山区农民制造了一种山地用的耕犁。这种山地步犁不但能犁水田，并能犁坡地的小块硬土、石头多的畬地，很受农民欢迎。
