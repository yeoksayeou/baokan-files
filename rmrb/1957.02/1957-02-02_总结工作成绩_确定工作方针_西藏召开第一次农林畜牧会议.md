Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th – The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held its first regional agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry work conference from January 22nd to 28th.

The information gathered at the conference showed that significant progress has been made in agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry work in Tibet in recent years. Since 1952, the Lhasa, Shigatse, and Qamdo agricultural experiment stations have introduced and tested 84 types of crops and vegetables, including nearly 500 varieties, most of which have grown well. Millet, sorghum, corn, beans, hemp, and various vegetables that had never been planted in the plateau before can now grow in the open. In recent years, the region has issued interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans equivalent to more than 3.5 million catties of grain, and the Qamdo area has issued more than 46,000 pieces of free iron farm tools. The production of government agencies and military units can now ensure self-sufficiency in vegetables and solve part of the grain supply. To date, twenty veterinary disease prevention and control institutions have been established in major cities and pastoral areas of Tibet. The three forestry management stations established last year have begun to rationally harvest and manage Tibet's abundant forest products.

When studying this year's work plan, the conference pointed out that strengthening investigation and research, absorbing and summarizing mass experiences, doing a good job in experimental demonstration work, and actively guiding and supporting mass production are important guidelines for developing agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry work in Tibet. The conference emphasized that it is impossible to develop Tibet's agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry without Tibetan cadres, and therefore decided that in addition to continuing to run training classes in Lhasa, it is also necessary to select students to be sent to specialized schools in the interior for training.

    总结工作成绩·确定工作方针
    西藏召开第一次农林畜牧会议
    据新华社拉萨30日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会在1月22日到28日召开第一次全区性的农林畜牧工作会议。
    会议汇集的情况表明：西藏地区农林畜牧工作几年来已经有了很大成绩。自1952年起，拉萨、日喀则和昌都农业试验场共引进和试种了八十四种农作物、蔬菜，包括近五百个品种，大部生长良好。高原上过去没有种植过的黍、稷、玉米、豆类、麻和多种蔬菜，也都能在露天地里生长。几年来全区共发放无息农牧贷折合粮食有三百五十多万斤，昌都地区发放无偿铁质农具四万六千多件。机关、部队的生产已经可以保证蔬菜自给和可以解决部分粮食的供应。到目前为止，西藏各重要城镇和牧区，已经建立起二十个兽疫防治等机构。去年建立的三个林业管理站，开始对西藏地区丰富的林产进行合理的采伐和管理。
    会议在研究今年工作计划时指出：加强调查研究，吸取和总结群众性经验，做好试验示范工作，积极指导和扶助群众生产，是发展西藏地区农林畜牧工作的重要方针。会议强调没有藏族干部是不可能发展西藏的农林畜牧事业的，因而决定除了在拉萨继续开办训练班以外，还要抽调学员送到内地专业学校培养。
