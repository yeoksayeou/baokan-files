Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 13th. A seamen's club has been completed in Xingang, Tianjin. On the evening of the 12th, over 300 people, including crew members of the "Peace No. 10" vessel and port loaders and dredgers, attended the opening ceremony.

Xingang is far from Tianjin city and is a large port built on the coast of the Bohai Sea just over four years ago. The completion of this club will bring a rich cultural and recreational life to Chinese and foreign seamen who have spent a long time at sea. The club is relatively well-equipped.

    新港海员俱乐部建成
    新华社天津13日电　天津新港建成一座海员俱乐部，12日晚“和平十号”轮的船员和港口装卸、疏浚工人等三百多人参加了开幕典礼。
    新港远离天津市区，是在四年多以前才在渤海海湾上建成的一个大港口。这个俱乐部的建成，将给经过长期海上生活的中国和外国的海员们带来丰富的文娱生活。这个俱乐部的设备比较完备。
