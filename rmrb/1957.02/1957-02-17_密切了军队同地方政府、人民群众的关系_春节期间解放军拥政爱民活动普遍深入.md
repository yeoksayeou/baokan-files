The People's Liberation Army throughout the country has nearly concluded its vigorous activities to support the government and cherish the people during the Spring Festival. This activity has played a significant role in strengthening the relationship between the army and local governments, as well as between the army and the people.

During the Spring Festival, the People's Liberation Army units across the country extensively sought opinions from various sectors to improve their work. They also held discussions and gatherings with local party and government organs and the people. In the Xiamen area, soldiers from various units even invited their landlords to celebrate together, engaging in heartfelt conversations and enjoying the Spring Festival. Troops in Nanjing organized special work teams to delve into factories, schools, street offices, residents' committees, public security stations, grain stations, and vegetable markets to solicit the opinions of the people. They held a grand celebration with more than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City.

During the Spring Festival, People's Liberation Army units in various locations also allocated many vehicles and other means of transport to carry people home for the New Year. For example, troops stationed in Guangzhou allocated a batch of military vehicles as buses, with carefully selected outstanding drivers at the wheel. Naval units stationed in Lüda and Qingdao even dispatched warships to transport workers whose families lived on islands home for the New Year. The workers said gratefully, "Such an army will never be detached from the people."

"Being thrifty and frugal ourselves, so that the people can have a good New Year" was a characteristic of the People's Liberation Army across the country during this Spring Festival. Troops in various places spent the Spring Festival by buying less or no meat, and buying less or no New Year goods. For example, the troops stationed in Kunming not only gave up the pork allocated to them by the food company but also supplied the pork raised by their own unit to the people for the festival. The People's Liberation Army organs, troops, and hospitals stationed in the capital gave 6,980 jin of pork to the citizens and bought 30,000 jin less flour, instead eating coarse grains. To ensure that the masses had a good Spring Festival, many officers and soldiers who had been granted leave to visit their families returned the tickets and passes they had already purchased. Those who had already bought theater and movie tickets also returned them to the masses. Their spirit of thrift and humility greatly moved the people. An old farmer named Shan Xinan in Xushui County, Hebei Province, heard that the People's Liberation Army was giving up pork for the festival, so he brought three jin of pork to the troops on the 30th day of the twelfth lunar month. He said, "Children, I feel really bad that you don't have pork to eat during the New Year." With that, he dropped the pork and left. The famous Peking Opera artist Gai Jiaotian, after hearing that the People's Liberation Army had returned theater tickets, said, "I am very moved by this, and I must perform a show for the comrades of the People's Liberation Army." Therefore, he specifically performed excellent programs such as "Happy Woods" for wounded and sick soldiers of a certain PLA unit in Shanghai.

To enable the people to enjoy the Spring Festival happily, the cultural work troupes and film teams of the People's Liberation Army units widely conducted慰问 performances and film screenings for the party and government organs and the people of all circles in their驻地. For example, the cultural work troupes of the troops stationed in Beijing performed 60 shows for the people of various districts in the capital. The cultural groups of the troops stationed in Nanjing City—the Frontline Drama Troupe, the Song and Dance Troupe, and the soldiers' amateur theater troupe, cultural propaganda team, and film team—held 慰问 performances for the masses in the urban and suburban agricultural cooperatives.

The People's Liberation Army units universally valued the opinions of local governments and the people. After reviewing the implementation of mass discipline, they began to resolve certain issues. For example, the Nanjing troops have returned more than 18,000 civilian houses and four school buildings that had been occupied, moved away from two scenic spots, and transferred more than 95,000 square meters of vacant barracks to local governments and agricultural cooperatives. The Wuhan troops have given up 772 mu of military land and will continue to transfer a large amount of land. The People's Liberation Army in various regions has expressed its willingness to do its best to help the people's production and national construction.

Through this year's Spring Festival activities to support the government and cherish the people, the relationship between the People's Liberation Army and local governments and the people has become even closer.

As is often the case, whenever there is a festival in our country, the People's Liberation Army is doubly vigilant in guarding the motherland's skies, seas, and land. For example, on New Year's Eve, an air defense unit stationed in a certain place discovered enemy aircraft intruding at midnight. All officers and soldiers immediately entered their battle positions, preparing to fight the enemy aircraft. When the enemy aircraft, seeing no opportunity, disappointedly fled, the sound of firecrackers celebrating the New Year was heard.

### 密切了军队同地方政府、人民群众的关系  春节期间解放军拥政爱民活动普遍深入

    密切了军队同地方政府、人民群众的关系
    春节期间解放军拥政爱民活动普遍深入
    本报讯　全国人民解放军，在春节期间所开展的轰轰烈烈的拥政爱民活动，已近结束。这个活动在密切军队同地方政府以及军队同人民群众的关系上，起了很大作用。
    春节期间，全国各地的解放军部队，都曾经广泛地向各方面征求了改善工作的意见。并且同当地党政机关和人民群众进行了座谈和联欢。厦门地区的各部队战士们还邀请了房东一起联欢，一起亲切谈心，欢度春节。南京市部队曾经组织了专门工作组，深入到工厂、学校、街道办事处、居民委员会、公安派出所以及粮站、菜站等征求人民群众的意见，他们同江苏省和南京市各界人民三千余人举行了盛大联欢。
    在春节期间，各地人民解放军还抽出了许多车辆等运输工具，载运群众回家过年。例如驻广州的部队就拨出了一批军车作公共汽车，车上的司机都是经过挑选的优秀驾驶员。驻旅大、青岛的海军部队还特别派军舰运送家在海岛的职工回家过年。职工们感激地说：“这样的军队永远不会脱离人民”。
    “自己俭朴节约，让人民群众过个好年”是全国各地解放军今年过春节的特点。各地部队，都是以少买或不买肉类、少买或不买年货的实际行动度过春节的。例如驻昆明的部队不仅让出了食品公司分配给自己的猪肉，还把自己单位养的猪供给人民过节。驻首都的人民解放军各机关、部队、医院等还把六千九百八十斤猪肉让给市民，并且少购了三万斤面粉，换吃粗粮。为了让群众过好春节，许多已经准假探家的官兵把已购的车票、船票退回。已经买了戏票、电影票的也退出去让给群众。他们这种俭朴、谦逊的精神，大大感动了人民群众，河北徐水县有一位名叫单袭南的老农民，听说解放军过节让出猪肉，他就在旧历30日提了三斤猪肉送给部队。他说：“孩子们，你们过年不吃猪肉，我心里真不好受。”说罢，把猪肉丢下就走。著名京剧艺术家盖叫天先生，听到解放军退让戏票后说：“这件事我很感动，我一定得给解放军同志演一场。”于是，他专给上海解放军某部伤病员演出了“快活林”等精采节目。
    为了让人民群众欢欢乐乐过春节，人民解放军各部队的文艺工作团和电影队还广泛为驻地党政机关、各界人民群众作了慰问演出和放映电影。如驻京各部队文艺工作团为首都各区人民演出了六十场。驻南京市的各部队文艺团体——前线话剧团、歌舞团和战士业余剧团、文讯队、电影队等，都在市区和郊区农业社为群众举行了慰问演出。
    人民解放军各部队普遍重视地方政府和人民的意见，在检查了群众纪律的执行情况后，都着手解决某些问题。例如南京部队已退还占用的民房一万八千多间、校舍四处，搬离风景区二处，并已把部队空余下来的九万五千多平方公尺营房，移交给地方政府和农业社。武汉部队已让出军用土地七百七十二亩，还要继续出让大量土地。各地区人民解放军都表示愿尽力帮助人民群众的生产和国家建设。
    经过今年春节的拥政爱民活动，各地人民解放军同地方政府和人民群众的关系已经更为密切了。
    如同经常一样，每当我国的任何一个节日，人民解放军都加倍警惕地守卫着祖国的天空、海洋和陆地。如除夕夜，驻某地的防空军部队于午夜发现敌机窜扰，全体官兵立即进入战斗岗位，准备同敌机作战。敌机见无隙可乘，扫兴而窜的时候，当地迎接新春的鞭炮声响起来了。
