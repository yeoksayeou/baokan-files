    Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 14th: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Algerian question on the 13th after nine days of meetings. The committee passed the proposals of Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines, as well as the five-nation proposal put forward by Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Italy, and Peru, which were instigated by Western colonial powers. The eighteen-nation proposal of the Asian-African group failed to pass.
    The committee first voted on the Asian-African eighteen-nation proposal demanding that the Algerian people be granted the right to self-determination. With the support of Asian-African countries, as well as the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries, the portion of this proposal that affirmed the Algerian people's right to self-determination, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, passed by a majority vote. However, when voting on the substantive portion of this proposal, which called upon France to fulfill the Algerian people's desire to realize their right to self-determination, some colonial countries rallied their forces to vote against it. As a result, this portion was rejected by a vote of thirty-three in favor, thirty-four against, and ten abstentions. The proposal's recommendation that France immediately begin negotiations with the Algerian people was similarly rejected by a vote of thirty-three in favor, thirty-four against, and nine abstentions, thus causing the entire proposal to be rejected. Subsequently, some Western countries insisted on first voting on the five-nation proposal. This proposal did not offer any constructive suggestions for resolving the Algerian question but specifically mentioned the French delegation's statement whitewashing France's colonial rule in Algeria. Under the manipulation of Western countries, the committee passed this proposal by a vote of forty-one in favor, thirty-three against, and three abstentions.
    After voting on the five-nation proposal, the New Zealand representative proposed that the committee no longer vote on the proposal put forward by Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines. This proposal hoped that France would find a way to resolve the Algerian question through appropriate negotiations with the Algerians and hoped that this issue could be resolved in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Under the opposition of Asian-African countries, this motion was rejected by a vote of forty-three against, twenty-four in favor, and ten abstentions. Finally, with the support of many countries that originally supported the Asian-African eighteen-nation proposal, the three-nation proposal passed by a vote of thirty-seven in favor, twenty-seven against, and thirteen abstentions.

    联大政委会结束阿尔及利亚问题讨论
    亚非集团提案在西方国家操纵下未能通过
    但通过要求法国同阿尔及利亚谈判的提案
    据新华社14日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会经过九天会议后，在13日结束了阿尔及利亚问题的讨论。会议通过了日本、泰国和菲律宾三国提案和受西方殖民大国主使的阿根廷、巴西、古巴、意大利和秘鲁提出的五国提案，亚非集团十八国提案未能通过。
    委员会首先表决亚非十八国要求给予阿尔及利亚人民以自决权的提案。在亚非国家以及苏联和人民民主国家的支持下，这个提案中的主张根据联合国宪章的原则承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权这一部分以多数票获得通过。但是，在表决这个提案的实效部分，就是呼吁法国满足阿尔及利亚人民实现自决权的愿望这一部分时，一些殖民国家却纠集力量投票反对，结果这一部分以三十三票赞成、三十四票反对和十票弃权遭到否决。这个提案关于要求法国立即同阿尔及利亚人民开始谈判的建议也同样以三十三票赞成、三十四票反对和九票弃权而遭到否决，因而也就使整个提案遭到否决。接着，西方一些国家就坚持先表决五国提案，这个提案对解决阿尔及利亚问题没有提出任何建设性的建议，却特别提到了法国代表团所发表的粉饰法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治的声明。在西方国家的操纵下，委员会以四十一票赞成、三十三票反对和三票弃权通过了这个提案。
    在表决了五国提案以后，新西兰代表提议不再表决日本、泰国和菲律宾三国提出的提案，这个提案希望法国设法和阿尔及利亚人通过适当的谈判来解决阿尔及利亚问题，并且希望能够按照联合国宪章的原则来解决这个问题。在亚非国家的反对下，这个动议以四十三票反对、二十四票赞成和十票弃权遭到否决。最后，三国提案在原来支持亚非十八国提案的许多国家的支持下，以三十七票赞成、二十七票反对和十三票弃权获得通过。
