Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th. The state-owned Wuhan Teaching Specimen Model Factory officially started production on the 4th. This factory is currently the largest factory in China manufacturing complete sets of intuitive teaching aids for secondary schools. It can produce more than twenty kinds of models, such as animal, plant, physiological anatomy, and paleontology, and more than ninety kinds of animal and plant specimens.

The existing teaching specimen model factories in China are small in scale and have simple equipment, and the teaching aids produced cannot meet the needs of secondary school development. After the Wuhan Teaching Specimen Model Factory is put into production, in addition to mainly producing specimens and models for teaching in secondary schools across the country, it can also produce teaching aids for some universities and primary schools, and some products will be supplied to foreign countries.

This factory was built on the basis of two workshops relocated from the Shenyang Teaching Instrument Factory. In 1955, the Ministry of Education decided to move these two workshops to Wuhan. Construction began in early 1956 and was completed at the end of the year.

    武汉教学标本模型厂开工生产
    新华社武汉6日电　国营武汉教学标本模型厂，4日正式开工生产。这个厂是我国目前制造中等学校成套直观教具的最大工厂。它能够生产动物、植物、生理解剖、古生物等二十多种模型和九十多种动物、植物标本。
    我国已经有的教学标本模型厂，都是规模小、设备简陋，所生产的教具远不能满足中等学校发展的需要。武汉教学标本模型厂投入生产以后，除主要为全国中等学校生产教学用的标本、模型以外，还可以兼作一部分高等学校和小学用的教具，一部分产品将供应国外的需要。
    这个厂是以沈阳教学仪器厂迁来的两个车间为基础兴建的。教育部在1955年决定把这两个车间迁来武汉。1956年年初开始建厂，年底建成。
