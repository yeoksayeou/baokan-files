    The Rooster and the Tomcat

    The rooster, when crowing at dawn, always emits a loud cry, so that people can hear it. This is precisely the rooster's duty, with absolutely no intention of showing off to people. However, the tomcat couldn't stand it. It complained, "I always silently catch mice for people, working hard and tirelessly, but who knows my hardship and merit? Look at the rooster, how cunning it is! It shouts and yells after doing one job, afraid that the whole world won't know! And me? I'm too foolish! I must learn to be cunning in the future!" So, when the tomcat caught mice again, it first meowed loudly for a while, and then lunged at the place where the mouse had escaped, only to miss. What was the result? Because it couldn't catch a single mouse, no one wanted it anymore.

    雄鸡和花猫
    雄鸡在清晨报晓的时候，总是发出高吭的啼叫声，好让人们听得见。这正是雄鸡应尽的职责，绝无向人们表功的意思。可是，花猫却因此气不过了。它抱怨地说道：“我给人们捕鼠总是一声不响地一干再干，有谁知道我的辛苦和功劳呢？瞧瞧雄鸡吧，多么样的刁啊！干一次活儿，就连连地大喊大叫，生怕普天下的人不能知道！而我呢？太傻了！以后我也得学学刁了！”于是花猫再捕鼠的时候，便先咪咪地大叫一阵，然后再向老鼠逃过的地方空扑一场。结果怎样？因为它捕不住一只老鼠，谁也不要它了。
