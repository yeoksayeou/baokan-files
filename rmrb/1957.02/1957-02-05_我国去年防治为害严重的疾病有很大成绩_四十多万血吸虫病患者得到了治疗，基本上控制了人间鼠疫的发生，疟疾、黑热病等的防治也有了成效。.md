Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: China made great achievements last year in preventing and controlling various diseases that seriously endanger the people's health.

Since the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" proposed the task of eliminating the most serious diseases endangering the people in January last year, more than 400,000 schistosomiasis patients in China have received treatment. Some epidemic areas have even seen the elimination of schistosomiasis in villages. In order to eliminate schistosomiasis, various places have mobilized the masses to carry out large-scale snail elimination work (schistosomes reside in snails). In the schistosomiasis-prone areas south of the Yangtze River and along the Yangtze River, the people used methods such as burning, weeding, burying snails with soil, and filling ditches by combining agricultural water conservancy construction to eliminate snails, with a snail elimination area of more than 15.8 million square meters. Many areas have strictly controlled manure management. Qingpu County, Jiangsu Province, where schistosomiasis was most prevalent in the past, now has a sanitation management office in every town, which collects residents' manure and stores it for a period of time so that the worm eggs are destroyed before it is given to farmers for use. This year, various places discovered many traditional Chinese medicines for the treatment of schistosomiasis. After clinical experimental research, it has been proven that *Lobelia chinensis*, *Sapium sebiferum* root bark, and *Potamogeton distinctus* have good effects on eliminating certain symptoms of late-stage schistosomiasis.

The prevention and control of malaria, plague, and kala-azar have also achieved results in the past year. In provinces with relatively severe malaria prevalence across the country, 38 malaria prevention and control stations and some specialized research institutions for parasitic diseases have been established to date. The main vector for transmitting malaria is the Anopheles mosquito. Preliminary understanding has been gained regarding the species of Anopheles mosquitoes, the nature of malaria areas, and the distribution. After investigation and research, medical workers believe that it is possible to basically eliminate malaria in all possible places in the country within the next seven years.

After the Ministry of Health convened a plague prevention and control professional conference in March last year, various places launched extensive rat and flea extermination work. Over the past year, the area using drugs to poison rats has been more than 10 million hectares, and the area using drugs to kill fleas has been 73 million square meters. In areas where rat plague has been discovered, more than 15 million dead rats have been collected and captured. The occurrence of human plague was basically controlled in 1956 (human plague is when people get the plague, and rat plague is when rats get the plague).

From the time of liberation to the end of last year, the health department had treated 600,000 kala-azar patients, with a cure rate of about 97%.

During this year, the Ministry of Health held training courses in epidemiology, parasitology, plague prevention and control, and malaria prevention and control, training 713 senior medical personnel. Provinces and cities have also trained a total of more than 80,000 intermediate and primary schistosomiasis and malaria prevention and control personnel.

In addition, investigations and research have also been conducted on leprosy, Kashin-Beck disease (big bone disease), endemic goiter, Keshan disease, and venereal diseases.

This year, the Ministry of Health will continue to focus on the prevention and control of schistosomiasis, plague, and malaria in disease prevention and control. In terms of schistosomiasis prevention and control, it is planned to systematically carry out snail elimination and implement manure management to eliminate worm eggs in all epidemic areas; it is planned to treat symptomatic schistosomiasis patients on a larger scale. In terms of plague prevention and control, plague vaccination will be carried out; the occurrence of human plague will be controlled, and the epidemic range of rat plague will be gradually reduced. In terms of malaria prevention and control, comprehensive measures such as mosquito prevention and extermination in residential areas, treatment of patients, and preventive medication will be taken to control outbreaks and epidemics of malaria, and to focus on eliminating highly malarial areas.

    我国去年防治为害严重的疾病有很大成绩
    四十多万血吸虫病患者得到了治疗，基本上控制了人间鼠疫的发生，疟疾、黑热病等的防治也有了成效。
    据新华社2日讯　过去一年，我国在防治危害人民严重的各种疾病方面有很大成绩。
    去年1月全国农业发展纲要（草案）提出消灭危害人民最严重的疾病的任务以来，国内有四十多万个血吸虫病患者得到了治疗。有些疫区并且出现了消灭血吸虫病的乡村。各地为了消灭血吸虫病，曾经发动群众进行大规模的消灭钉螺（血吸虫栖宿在钉螺内）工作。在长江以南和长江沿岸血吸虫病流行的地区，人民群众采用火烧、除草、土埋钉螺和结合兴修农业水利填平沟渠等方法消灭钉螺，灭螺面积达到一万五千八百多万平方公尺。许多地区对粪便进行了严格的管制。过去血吸虫病流行最严重的江苏省青浦县，现在每个镇都设有清洁管理所，收购居民的粪便，并且把它贮藏一个时候，使虫卵消灭以后再给农民使用。这一年中，各地发现了许多治疗血吸虫病的中药。经过临床实验研究，证明半边莲、乌桕树根皮、浮胀草等中药对消除晚期血吸虫病某些症状效果很好。
    疟疾、鼠疫、黑热病的防治工作，一年来也取得了成绩。在全国疟疾流行比较严重的省份，到现在为止已经建立了三十八个疟疾防治站和一些寄生虫病专业防治研究机构。传染疟疾的主要媒介是疟蚊，对于疟蚊的种别、疟区性质和分布概况等问题，目前已经有了初步了解。医学工作者经过调查研究后，认为今后七年内在国内一切可能的地方基本上消灭疟疾是可能的。
    去年3月卫生部召开鼠疫防治专业会议以后，各地展开了广泛的灭鼠灭蚤工作。一年来使用药物毒鼠的面积有一千多万公顷，用药物杀蚤的面积有七千三百万平方公尺；在发现鼠间鼠疫的地区，收集和捕捉的死鼠有一千五百多万只。1956年已经基本上控制了人间鼠疫的发生（人得了鼠疫叫人间鼠疫，鼠得了鼠疫叫鼠间鼠疫）。
    从解放以来到去年年底为止，卫生部门已经治疗了六十万个黑热病患者，治愈率达到97％左右。
    卫生部在这一年中举办过流行病学、寄生虫学、鼠疫防治和疟疾防治等训练班，训练了七百一十三个高级医务人员。各省市又各自训练了中级和初级的血吸虫病和疟疾防治人员共八万多人。
    此外，对于麻风、大骨节病（柳拐子病）、地方性甲状腺肿、克山病、性病等也都进行了调查研究。
    今年卫生部在防治疾病方面，仍旧以防治血吸虫病、鼠疫和疟疾为重点。在防治血吸虫病方面，准备在所有流行地区有步骤地进行灭钉螺和实行粪便管理，消灭虫卵；计划更大量地治疗有症状的血吸虫病患者。在防治鼠疫方面，将进行鼠疫菌苗预防接种；控制人间鼠疫的发生，并且逐步缩小鼠间鼠疫的流行范围。在防治疟疾方面，将通过对居民区防蚊灭蚊、治疗病人、预防服药等综合措施，控制疟疾的暴发流行，并且有重点地消灭高度疟区。
