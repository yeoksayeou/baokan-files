An Analysis of the Training Objectives and Teaching Plans of Higher Industrial Schools in Our Country
Zhang Wei, Vice President of Tsinghua University

Since the implementation of teaching reforms in our country in 1952, we have learned from the advanced Soviet teaching system, clarified the training objectives for each major, and formulated more comprehensive teaching plans based on these objectives. Such teaching plans embody the principles of integrating theory with practice, combining politics with professional skills, and cultivating students' ability to work independently. The teaching process has been enhanced by the addition of course design, graduation design, and nearly six months of production internships. This has fundamentally changed the teaching system that existed before liberation, which lacked clear objectives and well-developed plans. This has greatly advanced higher industrial education in our country. Recently, many comrades in higher education and industrial sectors have expressed many opinions on how to improve student quality, especially on the issue of training objectives and teaching plans, and debates have unfolded from different perspectives. This shows that everyone attaches great importance to this issue. Here, I would also like to offer some of my views on the training objectives and teaching plans of higher industrial schools.

What kind of people should higher industrial schools cultivate is the first question we must clarify when studying teaching plans. Let us first recall what kind of people engineering colleges in old China cultivated. In old China, the graduates of engineering colleges were called Bachelor of Engineering, but in essence, it was just copying the American degree name without seriously discussing what a Bachelor of Engineering should do or be able to do. It can be said that there were no training objectives at that time. It is undeniable that there are many engineers serving the country in the industrial sector today, with many achievements. However, these achievements are mainly due to their own long-term efforts and cannot be attributed to purposeful engineering education received in school. Recalling when we left university more than 20 years ago, we had no practical production knowledge at all. At that time, there was not much construction work, and we slowly groped our way from scratch after starting work. No one was dissatisfied with our quality. The designs we did at school were only based on examples in American textbooks, copying them mechanically by substituting different data. This can actually only be regarded as the work of a calculator, not design. Naturally, an important teaching component like the current graduation design was completely absent at that time. If college students at that time were allowed to take on design work or lead small-scale production work half a year or a year after graduation, just like today's graduates, the shortcomings of engineering education at that time would be even more thoroughly exposed. On this point, I think that all comrades who graduated from old-system engineering universities, as long as they recall the situation at that time, will see the shortcomings of the old industrial education more deeply and thoroughly. This aimless education system continued until before the national liberation, and basically remained unchanged for many years. It can be said with certainty that the past "generalist" education with no training objectives is not suitable for socialist construction in the new China.

So, what kind of talents do we need to cultivate now? For socialist construction, we must cultivate senior engineering and technical personnel with a certain level of political awareness, sound physical health, certain professional knowledge, and the ability to work independently. In simple terms, it is engineers (as for whether the degree title at graduation in the future is called engineer is not a matter of principle and can be considered further). Because of the weak industrial base in our country and the rapid development of new industrial construction, practical work requires university graduates to master relatively systematic knowledge in a certain major (how to divide majors is another issue, not discussed here for the time being) upon leaving school. Without going through special training courses in the industrial sector, they can independently solve not-too-complex engineering technical problems. Then, as experience increases, the ability to solve problems also increases. In the summer of 1956, the first batch of new four-year system graduates were trained in schools across the country, and this summer will see the first batch of five-year system graduates trained entirely under the new school system. If we consider that due to the sudden expansion of enrollment in 1952, the level of incoming students was very uneven, coupled with the fact that university teachers did not have enough experience in teaching work after the teaching reform, it is naturally difficult and premature to draw conclusions about the effect of the teaching reform based on the quality of the first four-year system graduates who have only served for more than half a year. However, judging from the feedback from many industrial sectors, it can be said that the university graduates created according to the goal of cultivating engineers under the new school system can basically undertake the tasks assigned to them by the state, which was not possible in old China's universities. Given the conditions provided by today's construction work for young people to train, the state's concern for cultivating young people in all aspects, plus the young people's own awareness and efforts, even people with originally poor foundations can continue to improve and progress. If we, the older generation, could improve in the adverse environment of the old society, we can be even more confident that today's young comrades are fully capable of overcoming the difficulties they will encounter.

From the history of the development of higher industrial schools in the world, cultivating engineers has always been its goal. In Europe, higher industrial schools originated in the era of Napoleon. At that time, for the purpose of aggression, he created artillery schools to train military engineers who would build bridges, roads, and manufacture weapons. Subsequently, it formed the higher industrial schools as seen in many countries today. The purpose remains unchanged, only that it mainly serves industry rather than the military. Therefore, it can be seen from the comparison table below that, except for the United States, many countries in the world all take engineers as the training goal of higher industrial schools. Even in American universities, in addition to the Bachelor of Engineering, there are also provisions for awarding engineer degrees in certain majors. This requires further study after obtaining a Bachelor of Engineering and meeting certain professional course requirements to obtain. However, we must also point out that the engineers trained in the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and our country are fundamentally different from those trained in West Germany and other capitalist countries. This is because we, through ideological education in Marxism-Leninism and other political courses and other courses, enable students to have a correct worldview and outlook on life and to clearly serve the people and socialism. On the other hand, higher industrial schools in capitalist countries, through the instillation of their system of political courses and professional courses, cultivate engineers who are willing to serve capitalists in the future. On the other hand, if we really are like the California Institute of Technology in the United States, and only teach a very small number of professional courses in university, our graduates will inevitably have to receive one or two years of professional training in factories, just like in the United States, before they can do practical work. However, most of our factories and mines today do not have the conditions to run such training courses. Moreover, from the principle of division of labor, it is unreasonable and uneconomical to do so. On the contrary, today, many engineers who graduated from old-system universities in the past, because they did not systematically hear the professional courses taught in industrial universities today, earnestly hope to attend professional courses in higher industrial schools. Taking Tsinghua University as an example, more than 1,000 formally registered auditing students in the last semester, mainly auditing professional courses for the fourth and fifth grades, rather than mathematics, physics, chemistry, or mechanics. We have also accepted some tasks of running certain professional course training courses outside the school, targeting not just graduates from the new system, but engineers and technicians who already have varying degrees of practical work experience. From the above example, we can see the advantages and disadvantages of the new and old school systems in training engineering talents, and at the same time, it makes us realize that engineers need to receive systematic professional knowledge in the process of education at school.

Some people believe that, in order to enable our science and technology to catch up with the world's advanced level within twelve years, it is necessary to cultivate research engineers [Note 1] in higher industrial schools, so that professional courses can be reduced and basic courses can be increased in the curriculum arrangement to improve students' research ability. This statement is incorrect. First of all, the meaning of an engineer refers to a person who can creatively solve engineering problems, which also requires him to be able to conduct research work. If research engineers are distinguished from engineers, it seems to lower the requirements for engineers in creatively solving engineering problems. Except for some emerging technologies, the vast majority of graduates from general engineering majors go to production departments to participate in practical work. We should not change training objectives and alter teaching content for the sake of a very small number of people going to research institutions; this would make it difficult for most graduates in future work, thus affecting national construction. Moreover, from the perspective of engineering technology and technical science research, the most important thing is that researchers can extract scientific problems with a certain degree of universality from practical problems, which requires them to have a certain amount of experience in production practice. If we put the cart before the horse and allow researchers engaged in engineering or technical science research to only see the importance of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, but have no production experience, it is very likely that their research work will use a lot of mathematics, but go in the wrong direction, and the problems chosen will be irrelevant to production. No matter how many such research engineers are cultivated, they will not promote national construction. Therefore, the most ideal source of engineering or technical science researchers is engineers and technicians who have been trained in production practice for a certain period of time, rather than university graduates who have just left school. In China, because our intellectuals have been influenced by the education of the old society for a long time, the tendency of theory being divorced from practice is extremely common and deeply rooted. In order to make our engineering and technical science research work develop healthily and serve production clearly, we need to select scientific researchers with research capabilities from practical work as much as possible, and give them opportunities to contact actual production from time to time in their work. I think this also applies to teachers in higher industrial schools. Therefore, general engineering majors should not take research engineers as the training objective.

Since the situation in our country requires us to train engineers in universities (or to train engineers as the direction), let us discuss what aspects should be started to cultivate such talents. This requires analyzing our teaching plans and comparing them with the teaching plans of other countries.

To cultivate engineers, we must enable them to have the ability to solve the actual problems in current production, and also enable them to adapt to the rapid development of engineering technology, and even contribute to new developments themselves. Therefore, in universities, we must not only give students theoretical knowledge, but also enable them to gain a certain understanding of production, and have various opportunities to exercise their ability to combine theoretical and practical knowledge and solve problems independently. Therefore, after our teaching reform, teaching plans generally have three main components: classroom learning (including lectures and various forms of exercises), production internship, and graduation design [Note 2]. Engineering university graduates are different from science university graduates. They must systematically study in school through lectures, experiments, exercises, etc., and at the same time, have a certain understanding of production practice. The purpose of production internship is to enable students to consolidate the theoretical learning of the previous stage in terms of professional skills, lay the foundation for the theoretical learning of the next stage, and create good conditions for course design and graduation design. Ideologically, it will also make them more aware of and value labor and practice. Graduation design enables students to independently use the independent working ability and various theoretical and production knowledge they have learned before leaving school, under the guidance of teachers, to solve an engineering problem. This is a very important part of cultivating students' independent working ability and a powerful measure to improve the quality of engineering students.

From comparing the teaching plans of some countries, we can clearly see that socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, Democratic Germany, and our country all appropriately arrange the three mutually related parts of classroom learning, production internship, and graduation design in order to systematically train the reserve force of engineers. We spread out production internships before the summer vacations of the third and fourth grades, and put forward different levels of requirements for production internships according to the content of the theoretical courses learned in each academic year. This takes into account the principles of combining theory with practice and step-by-step progress. This is a very prominent and superior point of our current teaching plan.

The teaching plans of engineering colleges in old China and the United States were completely different. There, some information on actual production was in the hands of capitalists and factory owners seeking profits. In order to compete with each other, this information was absolutely confidential. Capitalists even hindered the development of science in order to pursue profits. Graduation designs like ours are not feasible for them. Therefore, it is impossible to arrange our kind of production internship in their teaching plans. Therefore, they have no way to consider the question of how lectures, experiments, etc. can be related to production practice, and how to enable students to further improve their independent working ability through graduation design before the end of their studies. We can see that in the United States, whether it is the four-year system of the California Institute of Technology, the five-year system of Cornell University, or other schools, their teaching plans only have one method: classroom learning. Although West Germany requires production internships, they are mainly as apprentices, and factory owners may also take the opportunity to obtain some cheap labor. In the arrangement of internship time, students are also allowed to choose by themselves, so it is impossible to achieve the requirements of step-by-step progress and close integration of theory with practice. The graduation design in West Germany often depends on the professor's personal relationship with industry, and it has a high degree of spontaneity. These fully reflect the superiority of our socialist system's planned and purposeful training of talents, and the weakness of the capitalist system's lack of planning.

Let's take a further look at the classroom learning component. The courses in the teaching plans of various countries can generally be classified into the following five categories: political courses, basic courses (including mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, and drafting), basic technical courses (such as electrical engineering principles, thermodynamics, hydraulics, etc.), professional courses, and foreign languages, sports, and others. In this way, it seems that to cultivate engineering and technical personnel, countries all over the world must learn these knowledge and skills without exception. This precisely reflects the objective requirements and the results of industrial development in history. In the teaching plan, we should pay attention to how to properly arrange the proportion of these types of courses so that they can cooperate with each other. Unilaterally emphasizing a certain type of course will prevent us from achieving the goal of training engineers.

Now let's discuss basic courses, basic technical courses, and professional courses first. The time allocated for basic courses in schools in various countries in the comparison table is different. Whether in terms of class hours or percentages, we have increased the basic courses (including lectures and tutorials) more than in engineering colleges in old China before liberation. According to the feedback from many teachers in the school, the problem with basic courses now is not the lack of time, but the excessive content of the teaching syllabus and the insufficiently high quality of lectures, so students' learning is not solid and their application is not proficient. This requires studying the syllabus and the issue of teacher improvement after revising the teaching plan. In the 1955 Tsinghua University teaching plan, the sum of the class hours of basic courses and basic technical courses was 2,223 hours, which is more than the 2,088 hours of the California Institute of Technology in the United States and the 2,062 hours of the Darmstadt University of Technology in West Germany, which are known for their emphasis on basic courses. Our theoretical mechanics and mechanics of materials have 386 hours, while the California Institute of Technology only has 93 hours. In comparison, we have to learn much more. Adding up the three subjects of physics, theoretical mechanics, and mechanics of materials, we have a total of 602 hours, while the California Institute of Technology only has 462 hours, and West Germany only has 407 hours. From this comparison, it can be seen that we do not disregard basic courses in the teaching plan, as some comrades have said. On the contrary, basic courses have sufficient weight in the teaching plan.

In terms of professional courses, except for the California Institute of Technology in the United States, all other schools in various countries have more than 25% of the weight, more than 1,000 hours. The professional courses at the California Institute of Technology in the United States only account for 11%, 367 hours, but this does not mean that to be an engineer, university students only need this much professional knowledge. Graduates here have to receive two years of professional training in factories. Calculated in this way, the class time spent on professional course learning by a university graduate who can be an engineer far exceeds 1,000 hours. This school is also very special among American schools. Its undergraduate civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and chemical engineering departments only enroll a total of 180 people each year. The courses for each department in the first year are exactly the same, and civil engineering and mechanical engineering students also have to study 199 hours of inorganic and organic chemistry, which is obviously unnecessary. When studying and absorbing the experience of universities in other countries, we must see its social system background and the school's situation. Otherwise, isolating a single link and absorbing it will make our superior and basically reasonable teaching plan become like nothing.

Mr. Qian Weichang believes that our teaching plan is cumbersome, which affects the quality of students. Let's take a look at the professional courses in our teaching plan. The 1956 newly revised teaching plan for the machine tool and cutting tool major in Tsinghua University has eight professional courses, basically including machine tool design, cutting principles, tools and fixtures, and factory organization. To train a mechanical manufacturing and machine tool engineer, they need to acquire some knowledge in these aspects at school. The professional courses studied by mechanical manufacturing and machine tool engineers trained by West German industrial universities are only more than ours, never less than ours, only the course names are different. He also has a compulsory course called occupational disease, with a total of 34 hours. Cornell University in the United States also requires students in the mechanical engineering department to study materials processing (i.e., tools, cutting, etc.), engineering methods (i.e., process engineering), industrial production (i.e., factory organization), and security internships. In addition, they also have to study public speaking, which is unique to this capitalist country, for 48 hours, price control for 72 hours, and special employment reports for 16 hours. In comparison, it is more reasonable that we have made a sequential arrangement for the necessary professional courses based on the training objectives, which cannot be regarded as cumbersome. It is Cornell's public speaking and the California Institute of Technology's inclusion of public utilities and engineering conferences in the teaching plan that should be considered cumbersome.

Many comrades have suggested that courses such as economics, organization, and technical security should not be taught or should be taught less in professional courses. We believe that this view is also incorrect. On the one hand, engineers must be able to understand and solve individual production technical problems, but how to coordinate various production links in a workshop, a factory, or even on a larger scale is an increasingly important issue in the modernization of industrial production. Each part or process must naturally be well designed and produced, but the organization and coordination between processes, and even between various specialties, is equally important. If you only know the technology of individual processes but do not understand business organization and planning, you cannot become an engineer who plans and commands production (in the broad sense of production). It is worth noting that our teaching plans and those of the Soviet Union only give 120-130 hours for economic organization and security courses, while the California Institute of Technology in the United States and the Darmstadt University of Technology in West Germany each give 240 and 160 hours (including 60 and 34 hours of law, respectively). In this way, it is not appropriate for us to reduce the class hours in this area any further. Naturally, what the United States and West Germany talk about in these courses will only reflect the economy and business organization of the capitalist system, which is essentially different from the socialist economy and business organization plan that the Soviet Union and we talk about. But one point is worth noting: from the perspective of training engineers to serve their respective social systems, all need to teach a certain amount of economics, business organization and planning, security technology, and other courses in universities. The inclusion of these courses in the teaching plan cannot be considered that the teaching plan is cumbersome, thus affecting the quality of students. This is a requirement that real life puts forward for industrial education.

Cultivating students' independent working ability is a principle that we have learned from the advanced Soviet teaching system and want to implement in higher industrial education. In the process of university study, students' independent working ability should be gradually strengthened, and the problems involved should also gradually change from simple to complex. In the basic courses of the first and second grades, the main focus is on cultivating students' ability to analyze and calculate natural science problems with a narrower scope and simpler nature. As independent working ability increases, students are required to have some connection with engineering problems in basic technical courses, such as mechanics of materials only requires students to consider simple engineering problems from the aspect of strength, and engineering materials only teaches students how to test and select materials from the aspects of performance and production methods. In professional courses, it is necessary to cultivate students' ability to comprehensively solve an engineering problem from multiple perspectives. This requires a higher level of independent working ability. Only by gradually improving students' independent working ability from shallow to deep, from simple to complex, from single to comprehensive, can we expect them to gradually take on the tasks of engineers after graduation. From the arrangement of the sequence of courses and the amount of learning, our first and second grades mainly arrange basic courses, the second half of the second grade and the third grade mainly arrange basic technical courses, and after that, mainly professional courses. In terms of time, we have more tutorials in the lower grades, and gradually reduce them in the second and third grades; there are more classes in the lower grades and fewer classes in the higher grades. This also conforms to the principle of step-by-step progress and cultivating independent working ability. This is also where our teaching plan is more reasonable than that of capitalist countries.

In addition to the above three types of courses, the inclusion of Marxism-Leninism and other political courses is also one of the characteristics of the teaching plans of our socialist countries. Through political courses, we help students better establish a correct revolutionary outlook on life and worldview. At the same time, these courses also teach students scientific ways of thinking (other courses also play a role in this regard to varying degrees). The political quality of graduates under the new school system has greatly improved compared with the early days of liberation, and it is naturally even more incomparable with university students before liberation. This is a very important gain in education since liberation and even since the teaching reform.

Finally, let's analyze the situation of excessive burden in the teaching plan. We can compare it with various countries in two aspects: the average weekly class hours and the average weekly lecture hours. From the average class hours per semester and per week, our newly revised teaching plan is lighter than those of other countries. The California Institute of Technology in the United States calculates class hours inside and outside the classroom at 50 hours per week, resulting in an average of 26 hours inside the classroom, with a ratio of class hours inside and outside the classroom of 1:0.9. In our newly revised teaching plan, class hours inside and outside the classroom are calculated at 54 hours per week, with an average of only 26 hours inside the classroom and an average of 28 hours outside the classroom. The ratio of class hours inside and outside the classroom is 1:1.1. This shows that the amount of time we give outside the classroom is not small. From the perspective of the number of class hours per week, our new plan may still be slightly light. From the perspective of the average weekly lecture hours, we and other countries' schools are all around 17 or 18 hours. The average number of lecture hours in the first four semesters in West Germany is even as high as 19 hours, and as high as 23 hours in the first semester, which further reflects that the arrangement of our teaching plan is relatively reasonable, while capitalist countries often have great blindness and are not interrelated. The situation mentioned by Mr. Qian Weichang that higher education institutions in West Germany only have 17 hours of classes per week, and some industrial universities in the United States only have 20 hours of classes and experiments per week does not seem to be consistent with the actual situation. We are not opposed to absorbing good things from capitalist countries, but if it is not like this there, our absorption will lack a basis.

From the above analysis and comparison, after the teaching reform, due to learning from the advanced Soviet teaching system, our higher industrial schools have clear training objectives—engineers. The teaching plan embodies the principles of combining professional skills with politics, integrating theory with practice, and cultivating students' independent working ability, adopts a step-by-step approach, and systematically arranges various teaching parts and teaching links. From the practice of teaching for more than four years and from the effect of the initial graduates, the achievements of the teaching reform are certain, and the direction we have taken is in line with the requirements of our socialist construction. It is undeniable that due to the rapid development of the objective situation and our lack of high level and experience, there are still many shortcomings in the teaching reform work. However, from the above comparison and analysis, some of the past shortcomings are not the most fundamental directional ones. Therefore, correcting shortcomings now is not to change the fundamental direction, but to overcome shortcomings and continue to move forward along the correct direction of the past.

[Note 1] Some majors in the Soviet Union have the training objective called Engineer - Researcher, but there is no such thing as a Research Engineer.
[Note 2] The specific content of the graduation design is design or experiment, or theoretical analysis depends on the specific industrial conditions, the strength of the guidance teachers, and the school situation, and does not need to be specified in the teaching plan.

    对于我国高等工业学校的培养目标和教学计划的分析
    清华大学副校长　张维
    自从我国在1952年实行教学改革以来，由于我们学习了苏联先进的教学制度，对各专业明确了培养目标，针对着目标制订出较全面的教学计划。这样的教学计划体现了理论联系实际，政治结合业务，培养学生独立工作能力的方针；在教学环节中增加了课程设计，新添了毕业设计和近半年的生产实习。因此从根本上改变了解放前无明确目标，没有周密计划的教学制度。这使我国的高等工业教育大大地向前迈进了一步。最近一个时期，许多高等教育和产业部门的同志们对于如何提高学生质量，特别是对于培养目标和教学计划问题发表了很多意见，从不同的角度展开了争论。足见大家很重视这个问题。这里，我也想就高等工业学校的培养目标及教学计划问题，提出一些自己的看法。
    高等工业学校应当培养出什么人，是我们研究教学计划时首先要明确的问题。让我们先回忆一下旧中国工学院培养什么样的人。在旧中国，工学院将培养出来的毕业生叫工学士，但是在实质上只是抄了美国的学位名称，并没有认真地讨论过工学士应当做什么，能做什么？可以说那时是无培养目标的。不可否认，今天在工业部门里有许多工程师为国家服务，有很多成绩。但这种成果主要是靠他们自己长期的努力，而不能归功于在学校时受到有目的的工程教育。回想我们二十多年前离开大学时，实际生产知识一点都没有。那时没有多少建设工作，做事后慢慢从头摸索起，也没有人对我们的质量不满意。那时在学校里所做的设计只是根据美国教科书中的例子，依样画葫芦，代入不同的数据。这实际上只能算做计算员的工作，并不是设计。自然像现在的毕业设计这样一个重要的教学环节，当时更是没有的。果真像现在的毕业生一样，让那时的大学生毕业半年、一年后就去担任起设计工作，或领导小规模生产工作时，那时代工程教育的缺点就会更加暴露得彻底了。对于这一点，我想凡是由旧制工科大学毕业出来的同志们，只要回忆一下当时的情况，就会对旧的工业教育的缺点看得更深入更详尽了。这种无目标的教育制度一直延续到全国解放以前，多少年来基本上没有什么大变化。可以肯定地说，过去的无培养目标的“通才”教育，对于新中国社会主义建设是不适用的。
    那么我们现在需要培养什么样的人材呢？为了社会主义的建设，我们要培养有一定政治觉悟、体魄健全、有一定专业知识和独立工作能力的高级工程技术人材。简单说就是工程师（至于今后毕业时的学位称号是否叫工程师不是原则问题，还可以再从长计议）。由于我国旧的工业基础薄弱，新的工业建设发展迅速，实际的工作需要要求大学毕业生离校时对于某一种专业（专业如何划分是另外一个问题，这里暂不讨论）掌握了较有系统的知识，不必经过产业部门的专门训练班，就能独立解决不太复杂的工程技术问题。然后随着经验的增长，解决问题的能力也就随着提高。1956年夏，在全国各校培养出第一批新四年制毕业生，今年夏天才将有第一批完全在新学制下训练出来的五年制毕业生。如果我们考虑到1952年由于突然扩大招生，入学程度非常参差不齐，加以大学教师对教学改革后的教学工作的经验还不够，自然现在就根据只服务了半年多的第一届四年制毕业生的质量对于教学改革的效果下断语是困难一些而且过早。不过我们从许多产业部门的反映看，可以说，按照新学制培养工程师目标所造就出来的大学毕业生是基本上可以担任起国家所给他们的任务的，而这在旧中国大学是没有办到的。从今天建设工作给青年人提供锻炼的条件，国家在各方面对培养青年的关心，再加上青年人自己的觉悟和努力，即使原来基础差的人也可以继续提高、进步。如果说我们这一代在旧社会那种恶劣的环境下，还能提高，我们更可以相信，今天的年青的同志们完全有可能克服他们将会遇到的困难。
    从世界高等工业学校发展的历史来看，培养工程师一直是它的目标。在欧洲，高等工业学校原始于拿破仑时代。那时他为了侵略的目的，创设了炮兵学校，要培养军事上修桥、造路和制造兵器的工程师。随后就形成了如今天在许多国家中所看到的高等工业学校。其目的仍然未变，只是主要服务于工业而非军事而已。因此从下面的比较表中可以看出除去美国外，世界许多国家全是以工程师为高等工业学校的培养目标。即使在美国大学除工学士以外，也还有授予某某专业工程师学位的规定。这要在获得工学士以后，再继续读，满足一定专业课要求后，才能得到。但是我们也必须指出，苏联、人民民主国家和我国培养的工程师同西德和其他资本主义国家培养的有根本的区别。这就是我们通过马克思列宁主义等政治课和其他课程中的思想教育使同学们具有正确的世界观和人生观，明确要为人民、为社会主义服务。而资本主义国家的高等工业学校则通过他们体系的政治课和专业课等的灌输，培养学生将来甘心愿意为资本家服务的工程师。另外一方面，如果我们真的是如美国加省理工学院一样，在大学里只讲极少数专业课，我们的毕业生也就必然只好如美国一样，到工厂中再受一两年的专业训练，然后才能做实际工作。但是今天我们的厂矿大多数是没有条件开办这种训练班的。而且从分工的原则上看，那样做也是不合理和不经济的。相反，今天有不少在过去旧制大学毕业出来的工程师，由于在旧大学里没有系统地听到过如今天在工业大学中所讲的专业课，却十分殷切地希望到高等工业学校里来旁听专业课。以清华大学为例，上学期就有一千多位正式办理手续的旁听生，他们主要是旁听四、五年级的专业课，而非数、理、化、力学。我们也接受了一些到校外去开某些专业课训练班的任务，对象不是才从新学制出来的毕业生，而是已有不同程度的实际工作经验的工程师和技术员。从上面这个例子，可以看出新旧学制在培养工程人材上的优劣，同时也使我们认识到，工程师在学校受教育的过程中，需要得到系统的专业知识。
    也有人认为，要使我国科学技术在十二年内赶上世界先进水平，需要在高等工业学校中培养研究工程师〔注一〕，这样在课程安排上就可以缩减专业课，加多基础课，以提高学生研究能力的水平。这种说法是不正确的。首先，工程师的涵义就是指能创造性地解决工程问题的人，也就是要求他能进行研究工作。如果用研究工程师与工程师区别开来，似乎反而降低了对工程师在创造性解决工程问题上的要求。除去一些正在发展中的新技术外，一般工程专业的毕业生绝大部分到生产部门去参加实际工作。我们不应当为了极少数到研究机构的人而改变培养目标，变更教学内容；使大多数的毕业生反而在将来工作中感到困难，因而影响了国家建设。何况从工程技术和技术科学的研究工作看，最重要的是研究人员要能从实际问题中提炼出带有一定普遍性的科学问题，这就要求他具有一定的生产实践的经验。如果我们本末倒置，让从事工程或技术科学研究人员只看到数理化的重要，而毫无生产经验，很可能他们的研究工作用了不少数学，但是走错了方向，所选择的问题却是与生产无关的。这样的研究工程师培养得再多，对于国家的建设也不会起推动作用。因此工程或技术科学的研究人员最理想的来源是在生产实践中受过一定时期锻炼的工程师、技术员；而非刚出学校门的大学毕业生。在中国说，由于我们知识分子长期受到旧社会教育的影响，理论脱离实际的倾向极为普遍而且根深蒂固。要使我们工程和技术科学的研究工作健康地向前发展，明确地为生产服务，需要尽可能从实际工作中选择有钻研能力的科学研究人员，并且在工作中也要不时地给以接触实际生产的机会。这点我认为同样适用于高等工业学校的教师。因此一般工程专业不应以研究工程师为培养目标。
    既然我们的国家情况需要在大学里培养工程师（或者说以培养工程师为方向），那就让我们再讨论一下要培养这种人材应从哪几方面着手。这就需要分析一下我们的教学计划，并和其他国家的教学计划比较。
    要培养工程师，就要使他们具有解决当前生产中的实际问题的能力，也要使他们能适应工程技术日新月异的发展，乃至自己也对于新的发展有所贡献。因此我们在大学中既要给学生以理论的知识，也要使他们对于生产获得一定的知识，并且要有各种机会锻炼自己将理论与实际知识结合起来、具有解决问题的独立工作能力。因此在我们教学改革以后的教学计划一般有三个主要组成部分：课堂学习（包括讲课及各种形式的练习），生产实习和毕业设计〔注二〕。工科大学毕业生不同于理科大学毕业生，是既要在学校里通过讲课、试验、习题等方式系统地学习，同时也要对于生产实际有一定的认识。生产实习的目的是要使学生在业务上巩固前一阶段的理论学习，为下一阶段理论学习打下基础，并为课程设计和毕业设计创造良好的条件，在思想上也会使他更领会并重视劳动，重视实践。而毕业设计则是使学生在离校前，能将所学到的独立工作能力和各种理论和生产的知识在教师的指导下，独立运用，去解决一个工程问题。这是培养学生独立工作能力非常重要的一个环节，也是提高工科学生质量的有力措施。
    从比较一些国家的教学计划中，我们很明显地看到苏联、民主德国和我国这一些社会主义国家为了有计划地培养工程师的后备军，全适当地安排了课堂学习、生产实习和毕业设计这三个互相有机关联的部分。我们将生产实习分散在三、四年级的暑假前，按照各学年所学的理论课程的内容，对生产实习也提出不同程度的要求。这样就考虑到理论与实际相结合和循序渐进的原则。这是我们的现行教学计划非常突出优越的一点。
    旧中国和美国的工科大学教学计划就完全不是这个样子。在那里实际生产的一些资料是掌握在图谋利润的资本家、厂主的手里。为了互相竞争，这些资料是绝对保密的。资本家为了追求利润，甚至阻碍科学的发展。类似我们这样的毕业设计他们是行不通的。因此想要在他们的教学计划中安排我们这种生产实习也是没有可能的。所以讲课、实验等如何与生产实际互相联系，在学业结束前如何让学生通过毕业设计进一步提高他们的独立工作能力的问题，在他们就没有办法考虑在教学计划中了。我们可以看到，在美国，无论加省理工学院的四年制，或是康奈尔大学的五年制，或是其他学校，他们的教学计划中只有课堂学习一种方式。西德虽然要求有生产实习，但主要是做工徒，厂主还可能借机获得一些廉价的劳动力。在实习时间的安排上，也任学生自己选择，因此也无法达到循序渐进、理论密切联系实际的要求。西德的毕业设计往往要看教授个人与工业上联系的好坏，它带有很大的自发性。这些完全反映了我们社会主义制度有计划、有目的地培养人材的优越性，和资本主义制度无计划的弱点。
    再进一步让我们看看课堂学习的部分。各国教学计划中的课程一般全可以分别归入下列五大类：政治课，基础课（包括数、理、化、力学和制图），基础技术课（如电工原理、热力学、水力学等），专业课和外文、体育及其他。这样看来，要培养工程技术人员，在各国全无例外都必须学习这些知识和技能。这恰恰反映了客观上的要求和工业在历史上发展的结果。在教学计划中我们要注意如何将这几类课的比重安排妥当，使它们能互相配合。片面地强调某一类课程都会使我们达不到培养工程师的目的。
    现在我们先讨论基础课、基础技术课和专业课。比较表中各国学校对于基础课安排的时间是有所不同的。无论在学时数还是百分比上我们比解放前旧中国工科大学里的基础课全加重了（包括讲课和辅导）。根据学校许多教师的反映，现在基础课的问题不是时间少，而是教学大纲内容过多，讲课的质量不够高，因而学生学习不巩固、运用不熟练。这就需要在修订好教学计划以后，对大纲和教师提高问题加以研究。在1955年清华大学的教学计划中，基础课与基础技术课时数之和为二千二百二十三小时，比素以重视基础课著名的美国加省理工学院的二千零八十八小时和西德达姆斯塔得高工的二千零六十二小时还要多。我们的理论力学与材料力学有三百八十六小时，而加省理工学院只有九十三小时，相形之下，我们要学得多得多。物理、理论力学、材料力学三门相加，我们共有六百零二小时，而加省理工学院也只有四百六十二小时，西德只有四百零七小时。从这个比较也就看出我们在教学计划中对于基础课并不是如一些同志们所说的不重视，相反地，在教学计划中基础课是有足够分量的。
    在专业课方面，除去美国加省理工学院以外，其他各国学校全有25％以上的比重，一千小时以上的钟点。美国加省理工学院的专业课只占到11％，三百六十七小时，但这不能说明要做工程师，大学生的专业知识只要这些就够了。这里的毕业生到工厂里去要受两年的专业训练。这样算起来，他们培养一个能做工程师的大学毕业生，在专业课学习上所花的上课时间就远远超过一千小时了。这个学校在美国学校中也是很特殊的情况。它的本科土木、机械、电机和化工等系每年总共只招一百八十人。第一年级各系课程完全一样，土木系、机械系的学生也要念一百九十九小时的无机和有机化学，显然是不必要的。在研究和吸取别国大学的经验时，我们必须看到他的社会制度背景，和该校的情况。否则孤立地抽出一个环节，就加以吸收，那会使我们优越的、基本上合理的教学计划变得什么也不像了。
    钱伟长先生认为我们的教学计划繁琐了，因而影响了学生的质量。让我们看看我们教学计划中的专业课。清华1956年新试订的机制、机床及刀具专业的教学计划中有八门专业课，基本上包括机床的设计、切削原理，刀具和夹具，以及工厂组织这些方面的内容。要想培养一位机械制造和机床的工程师，就需要让他们在学校时对于这些方面就获得一些知识。西德工业大学所培养的机械制造和机床的工程师在学校所学的专业课只有比我们的多，绝不比我们的少，只是课程名称不同而已。他还有一门必修课叫职业病，共三十四小时。美国康奈尔大学在机械系的专业课中也是要念材料加工过程（即刀具、切削等）、工程方法（即工艺过程）、工业生产（即工厂组织）和保安实习。此外还要念这个资本主义国家所特有的演讲术四十八小时，价格控制七十二小时，和就业专题报告十六小时。两相比较，倒是我们针对培养目标，对必要的专业课做了有先后次序的安排较为合理，这就不能算什么繁琐了。倒是康奈尔这种演讲术，加省理工学院将什么公共事业、工程会议都列入教学计划倒应该说是繁琐了。
    许多同志提出来专业课中不要讲或者少讲经济、组织和技术保安一类的课程。我们认为这种看法也是不正确的。工程师一方面要能了解并解决个别生产技术问题，但怎样使各个生产环节在一个车间、一个工厂，乃至在更大的范围内互相协调起来，是工业生产向现代化方向发展中日益重要的问题。每一个零件或工序自然要设计和生产得好，但各工序之间，乃至各种专业之间的组织、配合得好也是同等重要的。如果只知道个别工序的技术而不懂企业组织、规划，就无法成为计划和指挥生产（指广义的生产）的工程师了。值得我们注意的是我们和苏联的教学计划对于经济组织、保安等课只给了一百二三十小时，而美国加省理工学院和西德达姆斯塔得高工却各给了二百四十和一百六十小时（包括法律各六十和三十四小时）。这样看来，我们不宜于再减少这方面的学时了。自然美国和西德在这些课程中所讲的只会是反映资本主义制度的经济和企业组织，这同苏联和我们所讲的社会主义经济和企业组织计划有本质上的不同。但有一点值得注意的：从培养为各自社会制度服务的工程师来看，全都需要在大学中讲授一定分量的经济、企业组织与计划、保安技术等课程。这些课程被列入教学计划也不能就认为是教学计划繁琐，因而影响了学生质量。这是现实的生活向工业教育提出来的要求。
    培养学生独立工作能力是我们学习了苏联先进教学制度以后，在高等工业教育中要贯彻的一个原则。在大学学习的过程中，学生独立工作能力要逐渐地加强，所涉及的问题也要由简单趋于复杂。在一、二年级的基础课，主要培养学生对于面较窄、性质比较单一的自然科学问题的分析和运算的能力。随着独立工作能力的增加，要求学生们在基础技术课中能与工程问题有些联系，如材料力学只要求学生从强度方面考虑简单的工程问题，工程材料也只从性能和生产方法教给学生如何试验和选择材料。到了专业课中就需要培养学生从多方面的观点去综合地解决一个工程问题。这对于独立工作能力的要求较高。只有由浅入深，由简单到复杂，由单一到全面，循序渐进地提高学生独立工作能力，才能期待他毕业后逐渐担任得了工程师的任务。从课程先后次序的安排和学习分量上看，我们的一、二年级，主要安排基础课，二年级后半年和三年级主要安排基础技术课，以后则主要是专业课。在时间上，我们的低年级辅导多些，到二、三年级就逐渐减下去；低年级上课多些，高年级上课少些。这也是合乎循序渐进，培养独立工作能力的原则的。这也是我们的教学计划比资本主义国家的更为合理的地方。
    除去以上三类课程以外，列入马克思列宁主义等政治课也是我们社会主义国家教学计划的特点之一。通过政治课我们帮助学生们更好地建立起正确的革命人生观和世界观。与此同时，这些课也教给学生们以科学的思想方法（其他课程也在不同程度上在这方面起作用）。在新学制下毕业生的政治质量比解放初期有了很大提高，与解放前的大学生自然更不能比，这是解放以后乃至教学改革以后在教育上很主要的收获。
    最后我们再来分析一下教学计划中的负担过重的情况。我们可以从两个方面与各国比较：每周平均学时和每周平均讲课时数。从每学期和每周的平均学时看，我们新修订的教学计划比其他各国的学校，全要轻些。美国加省理工学院课内外学时以每周五十小时计算，结果他的课内学时还平均有二十六小时，课内外学时比例是1∶0.9。在我们新修订的教学计划中，课内外学时每周以五十四小时计，每周课内平均也只有二十六小时，课外平均有二十八小时。课内外比例是1∶1.1。这说明我们所给的课外时间已不算少。从每周学时数看，我们的新计划还可能嫌稍轻。从每周平均讲课时数看，我们与其他各国的学校均在十七、十八小时上下。而西德前四学期的平均数甚至高到十九小时，其第一学期竟高到二十三小时讲课，这更反映出我们教学计划的安排是比较合理的，而资本主义国家则往往带有很大的盲目性和互不关联。钱伟长先生提到的西德的高等学校每周只上十七小时，美国有的工业大学每周连上课带实验在内只有二十小时的情况似乎与实际情况不相符合。吸收资本主义国家好的东西我们并不反对，但是如果他那里并不是这种样子，我们吸收时就缺乏根据了。
    从上面这一些分析与比较看起来，我们在教学改革后，由于学习了苏联的先进教学制度，在我们的高等工业学校里有了明确的培养目标——工程师。在教学计划中体现了业务与政治相结合、理论与实际相联系、培养学生独立工作能力的方针，采用了循序渐进的方法，有计划地安排了各个教学部分和教学环节。在这四年多的教学实践和从初期毕业生的效果来看，教学改革的成绩是肯定的，我们所走的方向是符合于我们社会主义建设的要求的。不可否认，由于客观形势的迅速发展和我们水平不高，经验不足，在教学改革工作中还存在着不少缺点。但是从上面的比较和分析看，过去的某些缺点不是最根本的方向性的。因此，现在改正缺点不是改变根本方向，而是沿着过去的正确方向，克服缺点，继续前进。
   〔注一〕苏联有一些专业的培养目标叫工程师——研究工作者，并没有研究工程师之称。
