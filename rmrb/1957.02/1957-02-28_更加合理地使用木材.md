    More Rational Use of Timber
    Promote Experiences in Increasing Timber Yield
    The four lumber mills affiliated with the Shenyang Lumber and Woodware Company are promoting eight advanced experiences to increase timber yield. It is estimated that this promotion will save the country over 3,000 cubic meters of timber this year.
    These experiences were created by the Shenyang Joint State-Private Da Dong Lumber Mill in July of last year. Relying on these experiences, the mill increased its timber yield from 68% to 85%. The main experiences are: doing a good job of preparation before production, ensuring that the opening saw operator, measuring operator, and sawyer are all familiar with and remember the different specifications of the timber before starting work, so as to cut materials according to the timber; adopting different cutting methods for the sunny and shady sides of the logs, and for the size and quality of the logs. At the same time, strengthening the connection between the opening saw operator, measuring operator, and sawyer to ensure clear standards during cutting and avoid specification errors.
    New Outlets for Waste Timber
    The twenty lumber mills affiliated with the Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau used to treat rough-edged small timber and 20 cm small timber as waste. This year, they will make full use of them and prepare to process wood cores and wood scraps into wood wool for packaging glass and porcelain.
    Lumber mills can use rough-edged small timber to make complete sets of box boards for factory product packaging. The bureau's sales department has already signed a supply contract with the Ministry of Chemical Industry for 1.6 million sets of box boards. The bureau will also use short and small scrap plywood to make 1.4 million wooden boxes for soap. Handicraft cooperatives in Tianjin, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and other provinces and cities have also recently signed contracts with the Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau for the supply of rough-edged small timber.
    Results of Improved Product Packaging
    In the past, the Shenyang Transformer Factory used to produce four models of switchboards and used fully enclosed (all wood, no gaps) packaging for all packaging box walls, regardless of the distance of transportation. This year, they sent people to solicit opinions from user units such as the Shenyang Electrical Manufacturing Factory, and jointly studied the issue with the factory's switchgear workshop, packing section, transportation section and other relevant business departments. They decided to adopt different packaging methods according to different product models and distances, while ensuring that product packaging was not damaged. From February, they began to use fully enclosed packaging for products transported to the Northeast, North China and other distant areas; and semi-enclosed packaging for products within the province and Shenyang. At the same time, they will also reduce the number of square timbers under the bottom of the packaging box from the original three to two, depending on the transportation situation, and promote the method of combining thick and thin wood. Through the above methods, this factory can save the country timber worth more than 78,000 yuan throughout the year.
    Plugging Loopholes in Waste
    In the past, people often used "gold everywhere" to describe the waste at the timber collection yard of the state-owned Changsha Timber Company. At that time, lumber workers often took home beams and crowbar ends longer than one meter to burn as firewood after dismantling rafts. After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign in April last year, the staff realized that this was wasting state property. Each yard established a waste material collection point and carefully collected short logs, scrap materials and other wood materials. These timbers are good materials for handicrafts cooperatives and agricultural societies in urban suburbs to use for repairs.
    In the past, much timber was often lost due to poor storage. Since April last year, the company's employees have learned and promoted the Soviet method of water storage to prevent cracking of miscellaneous wood, and collectively created a lime coating method, so that not a single piece of the accumulated timber was lost.
    Replacing the New with the Old
    In the past three months, the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant has replaced more than 330 cubic meters of high-quality new timber with old timber. The new timber saved can be used to repair 70 more standard open wagons.
    In the past three months, the proportion of old timber used by the factory in vehicle repairs has increased month by month: in November last year, the utilization rate of old timber accounted for 45.46% of the total timber demand, and by early February this year it had reached 61.35%.
    During the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, many workshop workers established "Old Material Utilization Groups" and improved the tools for dismantling vehicles to ensure that old timber was not damaged during vehicle disassembly.

### 更加合理地使用木材

    更加合理地使用木材
    推广提高木材出材率的经验
    沈阳市制材木器公司所属四个制材工厂，正在推广八项提高出材率的先进经验；推广以后，估计今年能为国家节约三千多立方公尺木材。
    这些经验是沈阳公私合营大东制材厂在去年7月创造的。这个厂依靠这些经验，把出材率由68％提高到85％。主要经验是：作好生产前的准备工作，开车工、摇尺工和锯工在开工前都熟悉和记住木材的不同规格，做到按材下料；对元木的向阳面和背阳面、元木的大小和好坏采取不同的割法。同时，在开车工、摇尺工和锯工之间加强联系，使下料时标准明确，避免规格错误。
    废材的新出路
    东北制材工业管理局所属的二十个制材厂，过去对毛边小材和二十公分的小材，都被当废材处理，今年都要充分利用，并且准备将木心、木头等废料加工成包装玻璃、瓷器用的木丝。
    制材工厂利用毛边小材能做出成套的箱板材，供应工厂作产品包装用。现在，这个局的销售部门已经同化学工业部签订了一百六十万个木箱的成套箱板材的供应合同。这个局还将利用短小作废的胶合板做一百四十万个装肥皂的木箱。天津、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等省、市的手工业合作社，最近也同东北制材工业管理局签订了供应毛边小材的合同。
    改进产品包装的结果
    沈阳变压器厂过去生产四种型号的开关板，在包装箱壁时不分运输路途远近，都是全部采用密封闭式（全部用木材不留缝）包装。今年，他们派人到沈阳电气制造厂等用户单位征求了意见，并且同本厂开关车间、装箱工段、运输科等有关业务部门共同研究，决定在保证产品包装不受损失的情况下，根据不同产品型号和远近地区，采取不同的包装方法。从2月份开始，他们把运输路途较远的东北、华北等地区的产品作全密闭式包装；把省内和沈阳市内的产品作半封闭的包装。同时，还将根据运输情况，把包装箱底下的方木由原来三根减少到两根，并且推行厚薄木材搭装的方法。通过以上办法，这个厂今年全年能给国家节约价值七万八千多元的木材。
    堵塞浪费的漏洞
    过去，人们常以“遍地是黄金”来形容国营长沙市木材公司集材场的浪费，那时候，运木工人拆排后常把一公尺以上的梁头、撬子背回家当柴烧。去年4月开展增产节约运动以后，职工们认识了这是浪费国家财产的行为，各场建立了废材收集处，把短筒、废料等木料都细心地收集起来。这些木材是手工业社和城市郊区农业社作修缮用的好材料。
    往年常常因保管不善而损失的木材也不少。从去年4月起，这个公司的职工学习和推广了苏联的水存杂木防裂法，同时集体创造了石灰涂抹法，使全部积存的木材一根也没有损失。
    以旧代新
    太原机车车辆修理厂在最近三个多月中，用旧木材代替了三百三十多立方公尺的优质新木材。节省下来的这些新木材，可以多修理七十辆标准敞车。
    最近三个多月以来，这个厂在检修车辆中利用旧木材的比例逐月提高：去年11月旧木材的利用率占全部木材需用量的45.46％，到今年2月上旬已经达到61.35％。
    在增产节约运动中，许多车间工人们都成立了“利用旧料小组”，并且改进了拆卸车辆的工具，保证在车辆解体中不损毁旧木材。
