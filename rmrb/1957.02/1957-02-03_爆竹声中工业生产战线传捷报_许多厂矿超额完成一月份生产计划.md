Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 1st: In the first month of this year, the final year of the first Five-Year Plan, the raw materials industrial production sectors in Tianjin have generally improved production.

The city's monthly output of steel, steel products, and electrolytic copper all exceeded the plan. Compared with January of last year, steel increased by more than 2,900 tons, steel products increased by more than 10,100 tons, and electrolytic copper increased by 70 tons. Steelmaking workers at the Tianjin Steel Plant increased the proportion of hot-charged molten iron, reducing the average smelting time per furnace by four minutes compared to the plan. Four joint state-private steel rolling mills expanded their equipment and increased shifts last year, greatly increasing production capacity. Workers in Workshop 1 of Rolling Mill No. 3 unified the operating methods of the three shifts, increasing the actual production time per shift from about six and a half hours to seven hours.

The chemical manufacturing industry also completed or exceeded the January output plan for major products such as sulfuric acid, chromic acid, caustic soda, water glass, and sodium sulfite. Workers at the Lizhong Acid Plant continued to promote the Shanghai Acid Plant's rapid feeding method, increasing the daily charging volume from 18 tons to 23 tons, and producing 126 tons more sulfuric acid in the whole month than in the same period last year. The main equipment of the joint state-private water glass factory, the reverberatory furnace, was officially put into use in January after renovation, reducing the average reverberation time from twelve hours to eight hours, and increasing the equipment utilization rate by 40%.

This month, the new speed record for Tianjin paper machine is 170 meters per minute. This was created by the paper-making workers of No. 3 machine of the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill. Nine local state-owned and joint state-private paper mills also completed the January output plan. Last January, the paper that paper mills across the city produced in thirty days now only takes twenty-three days. The yarn and cloth produced by five state-owned cotton textile mills also increased slightly. As of January 25, yarn production exceeded the same period last year by 933 pieces, and cloth production exceeded by more than 1.14 million meters.

Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Improves Quality

This newspaper, Taiyuan, February 2nd: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant exceeded the state-prescribed output plan for January by 4.1% and significantly improved product quality.

Many rejects were a relatively common phenomenon in the first half of last year. Therefore, all employees of the plant paid special attention to taking various measures to improve product quality in the first month of this year. In the past, in the electric furnace steelmaking workshop, entering the factory building required climbing two "mountains," one pile of slag in the south and one pile of scrap steel in the north, making the production site full of dust and creating many rejects. Now, the two "mountains" are gone. The entire workshop launched a group competition for rapid slag removal, furnace repair, and charging in January, shortening the average smelting time of each furnace by seven minutes compared with the previous month, thus ensuring the balanced completion of the plan every day. Due to the reduction of rejects, the quality was improved by 2.09% compared with the national plan, and the whole month's production of high-quality steel and alloy steel increased by 430 tons. Other workshops also completed the output and quality plans. The refractory material workshop completed the quality indicators for the first time in the half year since it was put into production after reconstruction.

Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Produces More Pig Iron

This newspaper reported: The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has successfully completed the production plan for the first month of 1957. The main product, pig iron, exceeded the work plan by 750 tons, metallurgical coke exceeded by 530 tons, and cast pipes exceeded by 120 tons.

The workers of this factory had prepared all the production preparations before the New Year. The young blast furnace workers said: "The plan for the year lies in the spring, we must fight a beautiful battle at the beginning of this New Year!" At the beginning of January, the three-shift duty personnel of this blast furnace specifically studied the current production situation of the blast furnace, proposed measures such as strengthening the control of furnace conditions and appropriately increasing the smelting intensity, and also proposed the goal of striving to increase the production of pig iron for the country in January. This figure has been exceeded on the 28th. The material handling work of a certain coke oven was originally planned to be completed at the end of the month. Thanks to the active efforts of the material handling workers, it was completed on the 25th, which increased the production of coke for the country by six tons alone.

Four Hundred Cars Produced Ahead of Schedule

This newspaper reported: In the first month of this year, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant overfulfilled the monthly production plan four days ahead of schedule. By January 27, a total of 416 Jiefang (Liberation) brand cars had been manufactured, 16 more than originally planned. This batch of new cars was successively shipped to Lanzhou, Xi'an, Hankou, Changsha, Nanchang, Hefei and other places. It has only been three and a half months since the plant officially started production, and the production technical level of many workers has improved rapidly, and stories of breaking through the design quota appear every day. Wang Zuoshan, a grinder in the tool workshop, has repeatedly improved production efficiency, and in January, he has already done the work for the second quarter of next year. He also proposed to ensure that the production tasks for 1959 will be completed this year. Shi Chuanlian, from the chassis workshop, was originally a student in a secondary technical school. After arriving at the automobile factory, he worked hard and has now become a skilled gear worker, and has not had an accident for seventeen consecutive months. While overfulfilling the January plan, all workshops in the factory strived to save steel, use waste materials, and overcome the difficulties of material shortages. Liu Qin, a process technician in the accessories workshop, suggested changing the thickness of the brass strip of the water tank cooling pipe from 0.18 mm to 0.15 mm, which can save brass worth 70,000 yuan throughout the year. Zhang Baozhu, an old forging worker with more than 20 years of experience, proposed to improve the method of forging steel ingots, reduce the processing allowance, and reduce the steel loss rate, so that the forging workshop can save 75 tons of steel in the production task of processing 1,500 tons of steel ingots.

Jiaozuo Mine Mined More Than 20,000 Tons of Coal

Xinhua News Agency, Jiaozuo, February 1st: The Jiaozuo Coal Mine miners persisted in production until the last minute of the Lunar New Year's Eve. When the mine's siren and the sound of firecrackers everywhere were competing at twelve o'clock on the 30th, the miners began to walk out of the mine one by one.

By January 30, the miners had overfulfilled the January coal production plan with a score of 114%, increasing coal production by more than 20,000 tons for the country. In January of this year, the coal mine changed the situation of slack production by miners at the beginning of the year due to the extensive and in-depth development of the production increase and economy campaign. Almost every day, the miners attended work at full strength. Until the late night of New Year's Eve, more than 3,000 miners were still working hard in the mine shafts 150 meters to 300 meters deep. The coal mining team led by Liu Jiuxue, the famous national model worker, produced 40 tons of coal more for the country on New Year's Eve. The coal mining workers in the fourth mining area of Wangfeng Mine achieved an average output of more than 9 tons per worker on New Year's Eve, creating a new record for the average daily output of coal efficiency in this mine.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, January 29th: By the evening of the 28th, the Fuxin Xinqiu Coal Mine had completed the January production plan ahead of schedule, and the workers had mined 800 tons of coal more than the original plan.

This mine has failed to complete the production plan in January for many years, but when the workers learned that many factories and cities urgently needed coal, they actively tried to improve coal mining efficiency and completed the production plan ahead of schedule. Now, the workers are preparing to produce more coal during the Spring Festival to supply cities and factories.

    爆竹声中工业生产战线传捷报
    许多厂矿超额完成一月份生产计划
    天津原料工业产量提高
    新华社天津1日电　在第一个五年计划最后一年——今年的头一个月，天津市的原料工业生产部门普遍提高了生产。
    全市钢、钢材、电解铜的月产量都超过了计划。同去年1月份比较，钢增加了二千九百多吨，钢材增加了一万零一百多吨，电解铜增加了七十吨。天津钢厂的炼钢工人扩大了热装铁水的比重，使每炉钢的平均熔炼时间比计划缩短了四分钟。四个公私合营轧钢厂去年扩充设备、增加班次，生产能力提高很多，轧钢三厂一车间的工人统一了三班的操作方法，使每班的实际生产时间由六个半小时左右增加到七个小时。
    化学制造工业部门生产的硫酸、铬酸、火碱、泡花碱、亚硫酸钠等主要产品，也都完成或超额完成了1月份的产量计划。利中酸厂的工人们继续推行上海制酸厂的快速投料法，每天的装料量由十八吨增加到二十三吨，全月生产的硫酸比去年同期增加了一百二十六吨。公私合营泡花碱厂的主要设备反射炉，经过改造在1月份正式使用，平均反射时间由十二小时降低到八小时，设备利用率增加了40％。
    这个月，天津造纸机车速的新纪录是每分钟一百七十公尺。这是国营天津造纸总厂三号机的抄纸工人创造的。九个地方国营和公私合营造纸厂也都完成了1月份的产量计划。去年1月份，全市造纸厂要用三十天时间生产的纸，现在只要二十三天就行了。五个国营棉纺织厂生产的纱和布也略有增加。到1月25日为止，纱比去年同期多生产了九百三十三件，布多生产了一百十四万多公尺。
    太原钢铁厂提高质量
    本报太原2日电　太原钢铁厂1月份已超额4.1％完成了国家规定的产量计划，并且显著地提高了产品质量。
    废品多，是这个厂去年前半年中比较普遍的现象。因此，全厂职工在今年头一个月便特别注意采取各种办法来提高产品质量。从前在电炉炼钢车间，进厂房要爬两座“山”，南面一堆渣子，北面一堆废钢，弄得生产场地满是尘土，造成许多废品。现在，两座“大山”不见了。全车间在1月份开展了快速扒渣、补炉、装料的班组竞赛，使每一炉钢的平均冶炼时间比上个月缩短了七分钟，因而保证了日日均衡地超额完成计划。由于废品减少，质量比国家计划还提高了2.09％，全月便增产了优质钢和合金钢四百三十吨。其他各车间也完成了产量和质量计划。耐火材料车间从改建以后投入生产半年来，第一次完成了质量指标。
    石景山钢铁厂多产生铁
    本报讯　石景山钢铁厂已经胜利地完成了1957年第一个月的生产计划，主要产品生铁比作业计划多生产了七百五十吨，冶金焦超过了五百三十吨，铸管超过了一百二十吨。
    这个厂的职工在年前就作好了各项生产准备工作。青年高炉职工说：一年之计在于春，我们一定要在这个新年的一开头打个漂亮仗！1月初这座高炉的三班值班人员具体研究了当前高炉的生产状况，提出加强炉况掌握，适当提高冶炼强度等措施，并且提出在1月份内为国家增产生铁的奋斗目标。这个数字已经在28日这天超额实现了。某焦炉的处料工作，原来计划在月底完成，由于处料工人积极努力，在25日就结束了，仅这一项就给国家增产六吨焦炭。
    提前制出四百辆汽车
    本报讯　今年第一个月，第一汽车制造厂提前四天超额完成全月生产计划。到1月27日，共制造出四百一十六辆解放牌汽车，比原来计划还多十六辆。这一批新的汽车，陆续出厂开往兰州、西安、汉口、长沙、南昌、合肥等地。全厂正式投入生产才不过三个半月，许多工人的生产技术水平都提高得很快，突破设计定额的事迹天天出现。工具车间磨工王作山一再提高生产效率，在1月份已经做到明年第二季度的活，他又提出保证争取在今年完成1959年的生产任务。底盘车间施传连，原来是中等技术学校的学生，到汽车厂以后，刻苦钻研，现在已经成为一个技术高明的齿轮工人，并且连续十七个月没有出事故。全厂各个车间在超额完成1月份计划的同时，都努力节约钢材，利用废料，战胜材料不足的困难。附件车间工艺员刘勤建议改变水箱冷却管的黄铜带的厚度由0.18公厘、改为0.15公厘，全年就可以节约价值七万元的黄铜。二十多年工龄的老锻工张宝珠提出了改进锻造钢锭的方法，减少加工的余量，降低钢材损耗率，使锻工车间在加工一千五百吨钢锭的生产任务中，就可以节约七十五吨钢材。
    焦作矿多挖煤两万多吨
    新华社焦作1日电　焦作煤矿矿工一直坚持生产到旧历除夕最后的一分钟。当30日午夜十二点正，矿上的汽笛声和各处的爆竹声争鸣的时候，矿工们才开始一个一个地走出矿井。
    到1月30日为止，矿工们以114％的成绩，超额完成了1月份的煤炭生产计划，为国家增产了煤炭二万多吨。这个煤矿在今年1月份，由于广泛深入地开展了增产节约运动，因此改变了历年年初矿工生产松劲的情况，矿工们差不多每天都是满员出勤，直到除夕的深夜，三千多名矿工，还在一百五十公尺到三百公尺深的矿井下进行辛勤的劳动。全国著名的劳动模范刘九学率领的采煤队，在除夕这天就为国家多生产了四十吨煤炭。王封矿第四采区的采煤工人，在除夕这天每工平均产量达到九吨多，创造了这个矿井平均日工产煤效率的新纪录。
    新华社阜新29日电　到28日夜晚，阜新新丘煤矿提前完成了1月份生产计划，职工们比原计划多采出八百吨煤。
    这个矿多年来在1月份都完不成生产计划，但是当职工们知道许多工厂和城市迫切需要煤的时候，积极设法提高了采煤效率，提前超额完成了生产计划。现在，职工们都准备在春节期间生产更多的煤供给城市和工厂。
