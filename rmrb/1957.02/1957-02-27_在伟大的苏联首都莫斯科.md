    In the Great Soviet Capital, Moscow
    Expansion of Moscow University
    Moscow University, standing majestically on Lenin Hills, is about to be expanded again. Preparations for the expansion have already begun. Around the university's beautiful and magnificent main building, two teaching buildings, four dormitories, and a library with a collection of books will be constructed. The new library is expected to hold five million books. If all its bookshelves were connected, they would be fifty kilometers long. It will be the university library with the largest collection of books in the world.
    The new buildings will be symmetrical to the existing buildings. The volume of the expanded buildings will be 450,000 cubic meters. Thus, the total volume of the university's buildings will reach three million cubic meters.
    Surface Rivers Diverted Underground
    In the past, there were more than one hundred small rivers on the surface of Moscow, but now most of them have disappeared from the surface, and the river water has been diverted underground. In those places where small rivers used to flow, neat streets, houses, and parks have appeared.
    In the past year, Moscow's builders completed a total of 40 kilometers of underground river channel construction projects. The river water passes through underground reinforced concrete pipes, or is led out of the city, or is diverted into the Moscow River. Now, the builders are continuing to eliminate these surface rivers that hinder urban construction. The Chura River, the Klayanko River, and others will soon disappear from the surface.
    Four Hundred Thousand Residents Will Get New Homes
    This year, approximately 400,000 or more residents of Moscow will receive new homes. They will receive a total of 1.8 million square meters of residential space.
    The main task of Moscow's builders in recent years is to move the residents who are still living in old houses into new houses. In terms of construction methods, this year will change the past practice of several families living together in one house, and instead, a large number of houses with kitchens, bathrooms, and other facilities for one family to live in will be built in the new residential areas.
    While increasing the number of houses, Moscow will also build new shops, schools, theaters, cinemas, and nurseries, and will also open up and adjust transportation arteries to connect the new residential areas with the city center.
    "Love Street"
    On a street in Moscow, a statue of Romeo and Juliet, the protagonists of a work by the famous British playwright Shakespeare, will soon be erected. This street will be named "Love Street."
    Moscow will also have several streets with new names, such as "Friendship Street" and "Happiness Street." These streets, with names that symbolize pure human emotions and a beautiful life, will welcome the guests who come to participate in the 6th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival.

    在伟大的苏联首都莫斯科
    莫斯科大学扩建
    矗立在列宁山上的莫斯科大学最近又要扩建了。扩建的准备工作已经开始。在大学的美丽庄严的主楼四周，一共要建筑两座教学大楼、四幢宿舍和一座设有藏书库的图书馆。新的藏书库预计将藏书五百万册。如果把它的全部书架连接起来，共有五十公里长。它将是世界上藏书最多的大学图书馆。
    新建筑将和现有的建筑物互相对称。扩建的建筑物的容积是四十五万立方公尺。这样，大学的全部建筑物的容积将达三百万立方公尺。
    地面河水改道流入地下
    从前，莫斯科地面上有一百多条小河，但是，现在大部分小河从地面上消失了，河水已经改道流入地下。在那些原来是小河流过的地方出现了整齐的街道、房屋和公园。
    在去年一年中，莫斯科的建设者共完成了四十公里长的地下河道建筑工程，河水通过地下钢筋水泥的水管，或是被引出城外，或是被导入莫斯科河中。现在，建设者正在继续消灭这种妨碍城市建设的地面河流。楚拉河、克拉央科河等不久就要从地面上消失。
    四十万居民将得到新居
    莫斯科今年将有约四十万以上的居民获得新居。他们一共将得到一百八十万平方公尺居住面积的住宅。
    莫斯科建设者最近几年的主要任务是要使目前仍然住在老旧的屋子里的居民都住到新房子里去。在建筑方法上，今年将改变过去一幢住宅供好几户人家合住的作法，而在新住宅区大量建筑带有厨房、浴室等设备、供一户人家居住的住宅。
    和增建住宅同时，莫斯科还将建筑新的商店、学校、剧院、电影院和托儿所等，还要开辟和调整交通干线，把新的住宅区和市中心联结起来。
    “爱情街”
    在莫斯科的一条大街上，不久就要树立起英国著名剧作家莎士比亚一部作品中的主角罗米欧与朱丽叶的塑像。这条大街将被命名为“爱情街”。
    莫斯科还将出现几条新名称的街道，如“友谊街”、“幸福街”等。这些标志着人类纯挚情感和美好生活的名称的街道，将欢迎前来参加第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的嘉宾。
