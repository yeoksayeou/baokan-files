Xinhua News Agency report: The Central South Construction Engineering Management Bureau recently made a decision at a joint meeting of managers and Party committee secretaries of various engineering companies: the entire bureau will save 10 million yuan worth of wealth this year. Currently, various companies are formulating specific savings measures based on this decision.

In the past month, in order to prepare for this year's savings work, the engineering companies under the Central South Construction Engineering Management Bureau have conducted top-to-bottom checks on savings and waste in the past year, discovering enormous potential for savings. In the past year alone, six engineering companies and the Bureau's Transportation and Materials Departments saved 6.3 million yuan, of which savings in building materials accounted for more than 70%. These units promoted 79 advanced technologies and experiences in saving building materials last year, saving more than 3,600 tons of steel, more than 3,100 tons of cement, and more than 10,000 cubic meters of wood; savings in other building materials were also considerable. However, the companies also found that waste was very serious during the inspection. The main reasons for the waste were that there were still many loopholes in material management, some projects had to be reworked due to unqualified quality, and non-productive expenditures were too large due to bloated organizations. In response to the above situation, when studying the savings measures, the companies paid great attention to strengthening material management and ensuring project quality. At the same time, each unit is also preparing to reduce staffing and mobilize a large number of personnel to return to production posts.

This year, the construction and installation engineering tasks undertaken by the companies under the Central South Construction Engineering Management Bureau are heavy and arduous. According to statistics, the total workload of the projects contracted by the companies is more than 40% greater than last year, and 80% are industrial construction projects, with very complex technical requirements. The joint meeting of company managers and Party committee secretaries believes that in order to successfully complete this year's tasks, it is an important link that must be grasped to practice strict economy on the premise of ensuring quality.

    中南建筑工程管理总局作出决定
    今年计划节约财富一千万元
    据新华社讯　中南建筑工程管理总局在最近召开的各工程公司经理、党委书记联席会议上作出一项决定，全局今年要节约价值一千万元的财富。目前，各公司正在根据这个决定制定具体的节约措施方案。
    近一个月来，中南建筑工程管理总局所属各工程公司为了作好今年的节约工作，从上到下地对去年节约和浪费的情况作了检查，发现了巨大的节约潜力。在去年一年内，仅六个工程公司和总局运输处、材料处，就节约了六百三十万元，其中建筑材料的节约占70％以上。这些单位去年推行了七十九项节约建筑材料的先进技术和先进经验，共节约钢材三千六百多吨，水泥三千一百多吨，木材一万多立方公尺；其他建筑材料的节约量也很可观。但是各公司在检查中也发现浪费现象是十分严重的。造成浪费的主要原因，是材料管理工作中还有很多漏洞，部分工程因为质量不合格必须返工，以及由于机构臃肿而造成的非生产开支过大等等。针对上述情况，各公司在研究节约措施方案的时候，都很注意加强材料管理工作和保证工程质量。同时，各单位还准备压缩编制，动员大批人员回到生产岗位上去。
    今年中南建筑工程管理总局所属各公司担任的建筑、安装工程任务，是繁重而艰巨的。据统计，各公司承包工程的总工作量，比去年增大40％以上，而且有80％是工业建设项目，技术要求十分复杂。公司经理、党委书记联席会议认为，为了胜利完成今年的任务，在保证质量的前提下厉行节约，是一个必须抓紧的重要环节。
