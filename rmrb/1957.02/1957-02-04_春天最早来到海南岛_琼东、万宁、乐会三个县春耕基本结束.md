    Spring Comes Earliest to Hainan Island
    Spring plowing basically completed in Qiongdong, Wanning, and Lehui Counties
    (Our dispatch) According to the Southern Daily, spring plowing has basically concluded in Qiongdong, Wanning, and Lehui Counties on the east coast of Hainan Island. The area of close planting of small plants in the three counties has basically met the requirements of the original plan. For example, of the 117,000 mu of rice planted in Qiongdong County, 90% was planted using close planting of small plants.
    These three counties generally implemented technical reforms last year, resulting in bumper harvests. However, in some local areas, some losses were suffered in the process of promoting technical reforms due to a failure to adapt to local conditions. During the opposition to subjectivist errors in the second half of last year, due to a lack of a pragmatic attitude and failure to affirm achievements as primary, some people exaggerated the shortcomings one-sidedly, leading many cadres to believe that technical reforms were a mistake. Therefore, the enthusiasm for production at the beginning of this spring plowing was not as high as last year. In order to clarify the confused thinking of cadres and enhance confidence, each county convened cadre meetings to summarize last year's production achievements and the achievements of technical reforms, analyze the reasons for the failure of technical reforms in some local areas, learn from the lessons, and launch a campaign to evaluate merits and commend models throughout the county, establishing examples of "advanced and prosperous societies." This boosted people's confidence. The three counties successively sent many cadres from county-level organizations to the countryside to strengthen production guidance. The spontaneous flow of technical reforms has been somewhat curbed, basically meeting the original requirements of each county. There has also been some change in the phenomenon of not applying base fertilizer.

    春天最早来到海南岛
    琼东、万宁、乐会三个县春耕基本结束
    本报讯　据南方日报报道：海南岛东海岸的琼东、万宁、乐会三个县的春耕已经基本结束。三个县的小科密植面积基本上达到了原定计划的要求。如琼东县种下的十一万七千亩水稻，小科密植的占90％。
    这三个县去年普遍实行了技术改革，因而都得到了大丰收。但是，也有局部地区在推行技术改革中，由于没有因地制宜，遭受了一些损失。去年下半年反对主观主义错误的时候，由于缺乏实事求是的态度，没有肯定成绩是主要的，一些人把缺点片面夸大了，使许多干部认为技术改革搞错了。因此，这次春耕开始的时候，生产劲头比不上去年。各县为了澄清干部的混乱思想，增强信心，都曾召开干部会议，总结了去年的生产成绩和技术改革的成就，也分析了局部地区推行技术改革失败的原因，吸取教训，并且在全县展开评功表模工作，树立“先进富裕社”的范例。这样，就鼓舞了人们的信心。三个县都先后从县一级机关中派出许多干部下乡加强指导生产，技术改革的自流现象已有所制止，基本上达到各县原来的要求。不施基肥的现象也有了一些改变。
