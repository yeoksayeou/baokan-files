New Method of Rafting Timber

    (Our report) The staff of the Liuyang Branch of the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau are using their created "bag-shaped herding rafting integrated transportation method" to transport timber from the Liuyang forest area to Changsha in a continuous stream.

    The bag-shaped herding rafting integrated transportation method involves tying fir strips into small bundles of rafts, connecting them one by one to form a large bag-shaped circle. Then, loose rafts are placed inside the circle, allowing them to float downstream in small rivers. If obstacles such as shallows or river dams are encountered along the way, the rafts enclosing the loose timber can first be dismantled. The scattered timber is left in places where the water flow is not rapid. The rafts are then passed through the obstacles individually. Downstream, the river is blocked, and the scattered timber left upstream is released one by one. These timbers are naturally received by the rafts and reassembled into a bag shape to continue floating downstream. In areas where the water flow is not rapid, manpower can also be used to pole. If some timbers that are prone to sinking, such as sleepers and pit props, are placed on the rafts for transportation, they will not be lost.

    Using this method to transport timber in small rivers saves 42% of freight compared to the previous method of using fir strips to build rafts. It reduces freight by 37% compared to shipping. (Deng Lin, Huang Minhua)

    流送木材的新方法
    本报讯　湖南省森林工业局浏阳支局的职工们，正在运用他们创造的“袋形赶羊流送综合运输法”，把浏阳林区的木材，源源运向长沙。
    袋形赶羊流送综合运输法是用杉条扎成小把子木排，一个一个连接起来，形成一个袋形大圆圈然后把零散的木排放在圆圈内，便可顺水在小河道内流放。如果中途遇到浅滩、河坝等障碍，可以首先把围笼散木的木排拆开，把散乱的木材停放在水流不急的地方，再将木排单独通过障碍，在下游拦住河道，将停在上游的散乱木材一一放下，这些木材自然地都被木排收容，再合拢成袋形继续流送。在水流不急的地方，还可用人力撑篙，如果有些易于下沉的枕木，坑木等木材，还可放在排上运输，不致散失。
    用这个方法在小河道运输木材，比以前用杉条编排搭运的方法节省运费42％，比船运降低运费37％。　（邓林、黄民华）
