Both Educating and Solving Difficulties
　　Shigan Township Demobilized Soldiers Properly Resettled
　　(Our newspaper dispatch) According to the New Hunan Daily, the General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Committee of Shigan Township, Jiangyong County, attach importance to the resettlement and ideological education of demobilized soldiers. Of the twenty-seven demobilized soldiers in the township, twenty-six have become backbones of agricultural cooperatives, serving as party branch secretaries, deputy directors of agricultural cooperatives, warehouse keepers, security committee members, supervision directors, sideline production team leaders, production team leaders, accountants, and work point recorders. Township and cooperative leaders often explain the future prospects of rural construction to demobilized soldiers through individual talks and forums, educating them to settle down for agricultural production, do their jobs well, and improve production. Hu Dingzhi, a demobilized soldier, was unfamiliar with agricultural production and felt depressed when he first returned to his hometown. After education and assistance, he improved his skills through practical training and now serves as the director of an advanced cooperative. Wang Bi, a demobilized soldier with a junior high school education, requested to participate in government work. After the party general branch secretary learned about this, he immediately talked to him, explained the reasons, and arranged for him to work as the chief accountant in an advanced cooperative, enabling him to play his due role. At the same time, the party organization also conducted publicity on resettlement work among the masses, forming a style of caring for and respecting demobilized soldiers.
　　The leaders of Shigan Township also pay attention to helping demobilized soldiers solve practical difficulties in production and life. During the autumn harvest distribution, for the six demobilized soldiers with real difficulties, subsidies of 210 workdays were provided through preferential labor days, etc., so that they reached the living standards of ordinary cooperative members. Wang Laifu, a demobilized soldier, had no house and could not afford to solve the problem himself. The township mobilized the masses to help with the work and requested a subsidy of 15 yuan from the Civil Affairs Section of the County People's Committee, which was properly resolved.

    既进行教育又解决困难
    石枧乡复员军人得到妥善安置
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：江永县石枧乡的中共总支委员会和乡人民委员会，重视对复员军人的安置工作和思想教育工作。该乡共有复员军人二十七人，现已成为农业社骨干的有二十六人，分别担任党分支部书记，农业社副主任、保管员、保卫委员、监察主任、副业股长、生产队长、会计、记工员等职务。乡、社负责人经常通过个别谈话和召开座谈会，向复员军人说明农村建设的前途远景，教育他们安心农业生产，做好工作，搞好生产。复员军人胡定志初回乡时对农业生产不熟悉，思想苦闷，经过教育和帮助，在实际锻炼中提高了水平，现已担任高级社主任。复员军人王碧有中学文化程度，要求参加机关工作，党总支书记知道后随即找他谈话，说明道理，并把他安置在高级社里担任主管会计，使他发挥应有的作用。同时，党组织还向广大群众进行复员安置工作的宣传，在群众中形成一种关心复员军人、尊重复员军人的风尚。
    石枧乡领导上并注意帮助复员军人解决生产、生活上的实际困难。在秋收分配时，对复员军人中六个实际困难户，通过实行优待劳动日等办法，补助了二百一十个劳动日，使他们达到了一般社员的生活水平。复员军人王来福无房屋自己又无力解决，乡里动员群众帮工，并请县人民委员会民政科补助了十五元，得到了妥善解决。
