Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 2nd: The total grain output of the Hang (zhou) Jia (xing) Hu (zhou) region last year increased by 11% compared to 1955, with a net increase of over 300 million jin of grain. The increase was equivalent to the total grain increase of the previous three years. Changxing County, which has always been known as a low-yield area, increased its grain yield per mu from 360 jin in the previous year to 500 jin last year. There were also 15,000 mu of "thousand-jin fields."

The Hang-Jia-Hu region is mostly plains, with favorable climate, rainfall, and irrigation conditions for developing agricultural production. Before 1956, grain output increased slowly and was extremely unstable. However, in 1956, when agricultural cooperation was realized, this situation changed relatively rapidly, creating an unprecedented record of one year's increase equaling the increase of the past three years. This is because agricultural cooperatives effectively utilized land to increase the multiple cropping index, and extensively changed over 1.8 million mu of early and mid-season rice and single-season late japonica rice fields to double-cropping rice. Last year, the grain increase from changing to double-cropping rice reached over 240 million jin. The large amount of labor provided by the agricultural cooperatives in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation also ensured sufficient water sources and fertilizers for changing to double-cropping rice and solved the problem of labor shortages during the replanting and harvesting of double-cropping rice.

    杭嘉湖地区去年增产粮食三亿多斤
    增产数量一年可抵上过去三年
    新华社杭州2日电　杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）地区去年的粮食总产量比1955年增加11％，净增产粮食三亿多斤，增产幅度相等于前三年粮食增产的总和。一向被称为低产区的长兴县，去年的粮食单位产量由前年的每亩三百六十斤增加到五百斤；这里还出现“千斤田”一万五千亩。
    杭嘉湖地区绝大部分是平原地带，气候、雨量和水利灌溉方面，很利于发展农业生产。在1956年以前，粮食产量上升缓慢，又极不稳定。但是在实现农业合作化的1956年，就比较迅速地改变了这一状况，创造了一年增产抵上过去三年增产幅度的空前纪录。这是由于农业社有效地利用土地来增加复种面积，把一百八十多万亩的早、中稻和单季晚粳稻田大面积地改种了双季稻。去年改种双季稻增产的粮食达到了二亿四千多万斤。农业社提供的大批劳动力，在兴修水利和积肥上，也为改种双季稻保证了充足的水源和肥料，并且解决了双季稻在复种、复收时劳力不足的困难。
