Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 15th. The engineering and technical personnel of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, responsible for designing the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, have made the route more economical and reasonable through repeated research and modifications during the survey and design process. The current route design plan saves the state more than 17 million yuan in project costs compared to the preliminary design plan.

Most of the area along the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway is characterized by high mountains and deep valleys, with complex geological structures. The railway must also pass through the famous mountains of Liangfengya and the Lou Mountain Range. When designing the Liangfengya section, the engineering and technical personnel combined the study of documents related to shortening the route and reducing project costs, and summarized the technical experience of opening the Qinling Grand Tunnel on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. They proposed seventeen plans and, after research and comparison, finally decided to excavate a 4,243-meter-long grand tunnel to pass through Liangfengya. This new plan can reduce project costs by more than 7 million yuan compared to the initially considered switchback line and short tunnel plan, and the quality of the line is also better.

From last year to the present, the technical personnel responsible for the internal design of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway have put forward fourteen relatively significant suggestions for modifying local routes; the personnel surveying the routes on-site have made even more suggestions. The section of the route from Zazuo Town to Guiyang had already been determined, but when the survey and design personnel discovered on-site that shifting this section of the route from the west side of the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway to the east side would be more economical and reasonable, they proposed a modification. This suggestion has been adopted, shortening the route by about five kilometers, and eliminating a 500-meter-long tunnel and a large bridge project.

Currently, the route of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway from Ganshui Town in Sichuan to Guiyang has been determined, with a total length of 320 kilometers. Compared with the preliminary design plan, it has been shortened by 19.5 kilometers.

    经过设计人员的仔细研究和多次修改
    川黔铁路选定线路经济合理
    新的定线方案比初步设计方案节省工程费一千七百多万元
    新华社成都15日电　负责设计川黔铁路的铁道部第二设计院的工程技术人员，在勘测和设计线路的过程中，经过多次研究和修改以后，使得线路更为经济合理，现在的定线设计方案同初步设计方案比较，共为国家节约工程费用一千七百多万元。
    川黔铁路沿线地带大部是高山深谷，地质构造复杂，中间还要经过著名的大山——凉风垭和娄山山脉。工程技术人员在设计凉风垭这段线路的时候，曾经结合学习有关缩短线路、减少工程费用的文件，总结打通宝成铁路秦岭大隧道的技术经验，提出了十七种方案，经过研究和比较，最后才确定开挖四千二百四十三公尺的大隧道，穿过凉风垭。这个新方案比开始考虑采用的盘山线和短隧道的方案，可以减少工程费七百多万元，线路质量也比较优良。
    从去年到现在，负责川黔铁路内部设计的技术人员，提出了十四项比较重大的修改局部线路的建议；在现场勘测线路的人员，提出的建议还要多。从扎佐镇到贵阳的这段线路本来已经定线，但是当勘测设计人员在现场发现把这段线路从川黔公路西边改到东边更为经济合理的时候，又提出了修改的建议。这个建议已经被采用，可以缩短约五公里的线路，同时可以省去一条五百公尺长的隧道和一座大桥工程。
    现在，川黔铁路从四川赶水镇到贵阳的线路已经定线，全长三百二十公里，同初步设计方案比较，缩短了十九点五公里。
