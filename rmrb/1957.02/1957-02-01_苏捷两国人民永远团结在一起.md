Editorial:

    The friendly talks between the Soviet and Czechoslovak delegations in Moscow have come to a successful conclusion. The joint Soviet-Czechoslovak declaration issued on the 29th demonstrates the complete agreement between the two sides on the international situation and current tasks, and embodies the spirit of unwavering solidarity between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet-Czechoslovak talks, like other recent talks between socialist countries, are a major event in further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and the cause of world peace.

    The series of meetings recently held between socialist countries has emphasized the importance of continuing to strengthen the unity of socialist countries in the current international situation. The Soviet-Czechoslovak joint declaration also clearly pointed out that the primary obligation of the two countries is to promote the unity of the socialist camp and the fraternal friendship of the peoples of socialist countries. Both sides believe that although the relationship between socialist countries encounters difficulties and shortcomings in the process of establishment and development, this relationship is unshakable. Although the application of Marxist-Leninist principles regarding socialist construction should take into account the specific development conditions of each country, this principle applies to all socialist countries. The fundamental interests of socialist countries are inseparable from the interests of the entire world socialist system. Strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries also strengthens the independence and security of each country, promotes the prosperity of each country, and improves the living standards of the people of each country. The common view and deep understanding of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia on the relations between socialist countries are of great significance for strengthening the unity of socialist countries and correctly resolving the problems existing between socialist countries.

    During the friendly visit of the Czechoslovak Republic delegation to the Soviet Union, it was repeatedly emphasized that strengthening the unity of Czechoslovakia with the Soviet Union, the center of the socialist camp, and strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, is very correct and necessary. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union is the first socialist country in the world, and the most powerful and experienced country in the socialist camp. The Soviet Union was the main force in defeating the world's fascist aggressors in World War II, the great liberator of many countries in Europe and Asia, and the great supporter of the socialist construction of the People's Democratic countries. The Soviet Union is a strong pillar of the world's workers' movement and the national liberation movement of oppressed nations. The Soviet Union is a bulwark of world peace and the hope of mankind. As President Zápotocký pointed out: The Soviet Union, as the center of the socialist camp, is the result of historical development, and this fact is undeniable and indisputable. Precisely for this reason, when imperialism undermines the unity of socialist countries, it first uses every means to sow discord between socialist countries and the Soviet Union, the center of the socialist camp. And that is exactly how the imperialists treat Czechoslovakia. They viciously slander Czechoslovakia's friendly alliance with the Soviet Union. They even hinted that if the Czechoslovak government distanced itself from the Soviet Union to some extent, if Czechoslovak communism could become something else, then they could change their unfriendly attitude towards Czechoslovakia. But all the slanders and subversive plots of the imperialists are futile. Czechoslovakia has concluded from its own experience that strengthening the unity with the Soviet Union, the center of the socialist camp, and strengthening the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, not only conforms to the fundamental interests of the Czechoslovak people, but also conforms to the fundamental interests of all socialist countries.

    In this meeting, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia shared completely identical views on the international situation. They firmly support the struggle of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and continue to oppose all conspiracies by aggressive forces to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. They continue to support the desire of the Middle Eastern countries to crush colonialism. At the same time, they believe that as the United States and other Western countries continue to revive West German militarism and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization continues to exist, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia are determined to consolidate the Warsaw Treaty Organization, making this treaty an effective tool for ensuring the security of all countries and coping with accidental events. The existence of the Warsaw Treaty strongly guarantees the safety of the people of European socialist countries to build their own countries peacefully, and makes the aggressive forces of imperialism dare not act rashly. There is no doubt that the current situation requires the continued maintenance of the positive role of the Warsaw Treaty Organization.

    The traditional fraternal friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia has been further consolidated and deepened in this meeting. The two countries will continue to do their utmost to develop close economic, cultural, scientific and technological cooperation between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union's agreement to provide Czechoslovakia with an additional 250,000 tons of grain, a large amount of aluminum and ferrochrome, and to increase the supply of iron ore to Czechoslovakia in recent years is a great support for Czechoslovakia's socialist construction. The agreement reached between the two countries on conducting extensive cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy will promote the development of science and the economic upswing in both countries.

    This Soviet-Czechoslovak meeting has achieved satisfactory results. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia have once again demonstrated in handling relations between the two countries that the new type of cooperative relations between socialist countries has unlimited development prospects. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the major achievements of the Soviet-Czechoslovak talks, and we will work together with the people of socialist countries to continue to strengthen the friendship and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

### 苏捷两国人民永远团结在一起

    苏捷两国人民永远团结在一起
    苏联和捷克斯洛伐克两国代表团在莫斯科举行的友好会谈，已经圆满结束。29日发表的苏捷两国联合宣言，表明了双方对国际局势和当前任务的完全一致的看法，体现了苏捷两国之间的团结无间的精神。苏捷会谈同最近举行的其他的社会主义国家之间的会谈一样，是进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结和世界和平事业的重大事件。
    最近举行的一系列的社会主义国家之间的会谈，都强调了在目前国际局势下继续加强社会主义国家团结的重要性。苏捷联合宣言也明确指出，两国的首要义务是促进社会主义阵营力量的团结，促进社会主义各国人民的兄弟友谊。双方认为，尽管社会主义国家之间的关系在建立和发展过程中遇到困难和存在缺点，但是这种关系却是不能动摇的。尽管在运用马克思列宁主义关于建设社会主义的原则时应当考虑适应各国的具体发展条件，但是这一原则却是一切社会主义国家共同适用的。社会主义各国的根本利益是同整个世界社会主义体系的利益不可分割的，加强社会主义国家之间的互助合作，同时也加强了其中每一国家的独立和安全，促进了每一国家的繁荣，并提高了每一国家人民的生活水平。苏捷两国对社会主义国家之间的关系的共同看法和深刻理解，对于加强社会主义国家的团结和正确解决社会主义国家之间存在的问题具有重要的意义。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表团在苏联进行友好访问期间，一再强调加强捷克斯洛伐克同社会主义阵营的中心苏联的团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结，这是十分正确的，也是十分必要的。大家知道，苏联是世界上第一个社会主义国家，是社会主义阵营中最强大、经验最丰富的国家。苏联是在第二次世界大战中打败世界法西斯侵略力量的主力，是欧亚两洲许多国家的伟大解放者和人民民主各国社会主义建设的伟大援助者。苏联是世界工人运动和被压迫民族解放运动的强大支柱。苏联是世界和平的堡垒，是人类的希望。正如萨波托斯基总统所指出的：苏联作为社会主义阵营的中心是历史发展的结果，这一事实是不可否认、不可争辩的。正因为如此，帝国主义在破坏社会主义国家的团结的时候，首先是用一切方法挑拨离间社会主义各国同社会主义阵营的中心苏联的关系。而帝国主义者也正是这样来对待捷克斯洛伐克的。他们恶毒地诽谤捷克斯洛伐克同苏联的友好同盟关系。他们甚至暗示，只要捷克斯洛伐克政府在某种程度上疏远同苏联的关系，只要捷克斯洛伐克的共产主义能够变成另一个样子，那末他们就可以改变对捷克斯洛伐克的不友好的态度。但是帝国主义者的一切诽谤和挑拨离间的毒计只是枉费心机。捷克斯洛伐克从自己的切身经验中已经得出的结论是：加强同社会主义阵营的中心苏联的团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结，不仅符合于捷克斯洛伐克人民的根本利益，而且符合于一切社会主义国家的根本利益。
    在这次会谈中，苏捷两国对国际局势的看法完全一致。它们坚决支持匈牙利工农革命政府的斗争，继续反对侵略势力干涉匈牙利内政的一切阴谋。它们继续支持中近东国家粉碎殖民主义的愿望。同时它们认为，在美国等西方国家还在继续复活西德军国主义和北大西洋公约继续存在的情况下，苏捷两国决心巩固华沙条约组织，使这一条约成为保障各国安全和应付偶然事变的有效工具。华沙条约的存在强有力地保障着欧洲社会主义国家的人民安全地建设自己的国家，使帝国主义的侵略势力不敢轻举妄动。毫无疑问，目前的形势需要继续维护华沙条约组织的这种积极作用。
    苏捷两国人民传统的兄弟般的友谊，在这次会谈中更加巩固和加深了。两国将继续全力发展苏捷之间密切的经济和文化科学技术合作。苏联同意在1957年额外供给捷克斯洛伐克二十五万吨谷物和大量的铝和铬铁，以及最近几年增加供给捷克斯洛伐克铁矿石的数量，这是对于捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的巨大的支援。两国在和平利用原子能方面进行广泛合作问题上达成协议，将促进两国科学的发展和经济的高涨。
    这次苏捷会谈已经获得了令人满意的结果。苏捷两国在处理两国之间的关系上又一次证明，社会主义各国之间的新型合作关系是有无限的发展前途的。中国人民衷心祝贺苏捷会谈的重大成就，我们将同社会主义各国人民一起，为继续加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的友谊和团结而努力。
