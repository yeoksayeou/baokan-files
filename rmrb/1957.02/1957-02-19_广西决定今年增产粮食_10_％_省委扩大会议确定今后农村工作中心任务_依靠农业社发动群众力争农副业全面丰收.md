Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 17th: The Fourth Enlarged Meeting of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held from the 10th to the 15th, determined that the central task of rural work in Guangxi Province in the future is to rely on agricultural cooperatives, fully mobilize the masses, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of agriculture and sideline production this year. Complete and overfulfill the annual plan for increasing grain production by 10% and sideline production; it is necessary to increase the unit yield of grain, and pay special attention to pig raising, requiring an average of one and a half to two pigs per household on the existing basis.

The meeting believed that it is entirely possible to achieve this production increase plan. Because after more than a year of advanced cooperativization, there has been experience in leading production and running cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have been basically consolidated through continuous rectification and improvement of management. At the same time, a large number of cadres will go deep into the countryside, which will strengthen the leadership of rural work. During the discussion, according to the reports of representatives from various places attending the meeting, the current rural production has had a good start. The preparatory work for spring plowing in most areas has set off a mass upsurge. In Cenxi, Rongxian and other places, 91% of the cooperatives participated in the bumper harvest competition. According to statistics from relevant departments, 19,000 large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects have been started throughout the province, accounting for 60% of the annual water conservancy construction plan. In addition, more than 242 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated throughout the province. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in many areas has increased compared with last year, and the quality has generally improved. Most agricultural cooperatives have combined summing up their work and formulated annual production plans in light of local conditions.

After analyzing the current ideological situation of rural cadres and the masses, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to further carry out publicity and education work in rural areas. Party committees at all levels should strengthen ideological leadership, and the political work of agricultural cooperatives should be regularized. While improving the political and ideological level of cadres and the masses, a "five checks" campaign should be launched throughout the province to check spring plowing preparations, check sideline occupations, check mountain production, check the management of cooperatives, and check disaster relief.

    广西决定今年增产粮食10％
    省委扩大会议确定今后农村工作中心任务
    依靠农业社发动群众力争农副业全面丰收
    新华社南宁17日电　在10日到15日举行的中共广西省委员会第四次扩大会议上，确定广西省今后农村工作的中心任务是：依靠农业合作社，充分发动群众，力争今年农、副业全面丰收。完成和超额完成全年粮食增产10％和副业生产的计划；要提高粮食单位面积产量，特别要注意养猪，要求在现有基础上，平均每户养猪一头半到两头。
    会议认为，实现这一增产计划是完全可能的。因为高级合作化后一年多来，已有了领导生产和办社的经验，全省农业社经过不断整顿和改善经营管理也基本上巩固。同时将有大批干部深入农村，这样就会加强了对农村工作的领导。在讨论中，根据各地出席会议代表的汇报，当前农村生产已有了一个较好的开端。大部分地区的备耕工作掀起了群众性的热潮。岑溪、容县等地91％的社参加了丰产竞赛。据有关部门统计，全省已开工的大中小型水利工程一万九千处，占全年水利兴修计划的60％。另外，全省已积肥二亿四千二百多万担。不少地区积肥数量比去年增加，质量普遍提高。多数农业社已结合总结工作，因地制宜地订出了全年生产计划。
    会议在分析了当前农村干部和群众的思想情况后指出：在农村必须进一步开展宣传教育工作，各级党委应加强思想领导，农业社的政治工作应做到经常化。在提高干部和群众的政治思想水平的同时，在全省开展一个查春耕准备、查副业、查山区生产、查社的经营管理、查救灾的“五查”运动。
