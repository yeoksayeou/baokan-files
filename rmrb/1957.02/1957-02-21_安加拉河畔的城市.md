City on the Angara River
Soviet Writer I. Molchanov

For more than fifty years, my life has been closely connected with Irkutsk. In my childhood, my companions and I used to travel to a small island eroded by mountain floods in Irkut, where Irkutsk was founded about three hundred years ago.

There is nothing left on this small island, but we quickly became explorers and archaeologists. We carefully excavated the ground of the island, hoping to find some memorable ancient relics. We imagined scenes from the distant past: the daring Russians who appeared on this river, overcoming all unimaginable difficulties to explore Siberia. We felt as if a majestic wall of forest rose before us, and the roar of the waves of Lake Baikal echoed from afar. Our love for our beloved city (one of the oldest cities in eastern Siberia) grew stronger in our hearts.

Let's see how Irkutsk grew and developed. Soon after Irkutsk was founded on this island, people moved to the right bank of the Angara River. Since then, this small city has been growing every moment. From the end of the seventeenth century, caravans began to travel frequently from Irkutsk to China. From the middle of the eighteenth century, the Irkutsk business community began to participate in shipping and trade on the northeast coast of Asia and Alaska. Irkutsk's cultural life also developed. In 1778, the first "public library" in eastern Siberia appeared in the city, then called "a library set up to eliminate the ignorance and darkness of this border area."

Before the revolution, Irkutsk was the commercial and administrative center of this region in the country. Its population continued to increase due to immigrants from the west and exiled political prisoners - people not tolerated by the Tsarist government.

Now, Irkutsk has become a huge industrial and cultural center in eastern Siberia. It has a population of more than 314,000. During the Soviet era, many large industrial enterprises were built here. There are more than 100 industrial enterprises such as the Kuibyshev Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant and the Machine Tool Manufacturing Plant. In 1955, the output of these industrial enterprises increased by two times compared with 1940, equivalent to hundreds of times the output before the revolution.

Irkutsk has become a huge transportation hub. I still clearly remember the day when many Irkutsk people got tickets to visit the first plane taking off in the park. This was a few years before the revolution. Now Irkutsk has become the largest aviation station. Several important international routes pass through here.

The appearance of Irkutsk is changing year by year. It is becoming more and more beautiful, and residential and cultural facilities are becoming more and more perfect. The new housing built in the post-war period is equivalent to the area built in the 260 years before the revolution.

In 1913, the only power station in the city produced electricity only enough for four days now. From 1947, there were trams on the streets of Irkutsk. Now there are a total of one hundred kilometers of bus lines in the city. Dozens of medical institutions care for the health of citizens. There are more and more trees and flowers in the city. The garden where the Lenin statue is located has become a beautiful scenic spot in the city.

Irkutsk now has seven institutions of higher learning such as the State University and Normal College, 23 secondary technical schools and other secondary vocational schools, 76 general schools and 16 schools for young workers. More than 20,000 students are studying in colleges and secondary technical schools. Specialized talents in more than 40 kinds of occupations are being trained. It should be remembered that before the revolution, there were only 15,000 boys and 7,000 girls in the entire Irkutsk province who received education, and most of them were in elementary schools. Now, Irkutsk city alone has more than 43,000 primary and secondary school students. 7,000 pre-school children share 76 kindergartens.

The East Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences was established in Irkutsk in February 1949. In addition, there are more than ten scientific research institutions in the city. There are more than 1,000 scientific workers working in universities and scientific institutions.

Irkutsk people love their theaters. There is a drama theater, a puppet theater, a music hall, etc., which recently celebrated its 100th anniversary. There are nine cinemas, 25 clubs and cultural centers, and 125 mass libraries in the city.

Many glorious tasks await the workers of Irkutsk in the current Five-Year Plan. In the instructions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the development of industry and culture in eastern Siberia and Irkutsk itself is given an important position. As everyone knows, as early as July 1956, the builders of the Irkutsk Hydropower Station blocked the majestic Angara River. The first child of the Angara River cascade—the Irkutsk Hydropower Station—has generated cheap electricity (the cost per kilowatt-hour is less than one kopeck), and part of the current will be transmitted to the construction site of the world's largest Bratsk Hydropower Station.

In the era of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Irkutsk's industrial enterprises must ensure that output increases by 60% to 70%. This task will be accomplished by building new industrial enterprises and by improving the utilization of existing equipment. The number of large and small factories that Irkutsk will build during the Sixth Five-Year Plan is countless!

A new huge college town has begun to be built. It is located on the left bank of the Angara River, where the Mining and Metallurgical College, the Architectural Engineering College and the Engineering College are distributed. Teacher residences, student dormitories, clubs, stadiums, etc. will also be built. Our beloved Irkutsk on the Angara River will become richer and more beautiful day by day. The endless potential of the Angara River is also increasingly used to benefit the Soviet people - the builders of communism.

The friendly relations between Irkutsk citizens and foreign workers are strengthening year by year. Irkutsk people often cordially receive many outstanding statesmen and ordinary people - fighters for peace.

Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai have all visited Irkutsk. Many cultural representatives have also come here as guests. A group of interns - sons of the great Chinese people, are working excellently among the united builders of the Irkutsk Hydropower Station. The residents of Irkutsk have great interest in Chinese art and science.

We are very happy about the great achievements of the People's Republic of China. The workers of Irkutsk, like all the Soviet people, are full of determination to further consolidate the great friendship between the people of our two countries.

    安加拉河畔的城市
    苏联作家　伊·莫尔察诺夫
    五十多年来，我的生活一直是同伊尔库次克紧密地联系在一起的。童年时代，我和同伴们曾到伊尔库特山山洪冲刷的一个小岛上去旅行，伊尔库次克就是大约三百年前在那里奠基的。
    这个小岛上已经什么东西都没有了，但我们很快就变成了探险家，同时又是考古学家。我们仔细地挖掘着小岛的地面，想找到一些值得纪念的古代的遗迹。我们想像着久远的过去的情景：那时在这条河上出现了大胆的俄罗斯人，他们克服了一切难以想像的困难来探查西伯利亚。我们觉得，好像有一道雄伟的森林的墙在我们面前升起来，远方传来了贝加尔湖的惊涛骇浪的喧嚣声。我们心中增强了对我们亲爱的城市（西伯利亚东部最古老的城市之一）的热爱。
    我们来看看伊尔库次克是怎样生长和发展起来的吧。当伊尔库次克在这个岛屿上奠立以后不久，人们就都迁居到安加拉河的右岸去了。此后，这个小城市在每时每刻地成长着。从十七世纪末叶起，商队开始经常从伊尔库次克前往中国。从十八世纪中叶起，伊尔库次克商界开始参加亚洲东北部海岸和阿拉斯加的航业和贸易。伊尔库次克的文化生活也发展起来了。1778年，市里出现了西伯利亚东部第一所“公共图书馆”，当时被称做“为了扫除这个边区的愚昧黑暗”而设的“书库”。
    伊尔库次克在革命前是国内这个地区的商业和行政中心。它的人口由于从西部来的移民、被放逐的政治犯——为沙皇政府所不容的人们——而不断增加。
    现在，伊尔库次克已成为西伯利亚东部巨大的工业和文化中心。这里的居民已有三十一万四千多人。在苏维埃政权的年代里，这里建成了许多大工业企业。有古比雪夫重型机器制造厂和机床制造厂等一百多个工业企业。1955年，这些工业企业的产量比1940年增加了两倍，相当于革命前产量的数百倍。
    伊尔库次克已经成为巨大的运输枢纽。在我的记忆中还清楚地保存着这样一天的印象，那天很多伊尔库次克人获得了参观公园内第一架飞机起飞的入场券。这还是革命前几年的事。现在伊尔库次克业已成为最大的航空站。好几条重要的国际航线都经过这里。
    伊尔库次克的外貌在逐年地改变着。它越来越美丽，住宅和文化生活设施越来越完善了。在战后时期新建的住宅就相当于革命前二百六十年所建筑的面积。
    1913年，市内唯一的发电站每年生产的电力只够现在四天之用。从1947年起，伊尔库次克的街道上有了电车。现在市内共有一百公里长的公共汽车线路。数十个医疗机关关怀着公民们的健康。市内树木和花草越来越多。列宁纪念像所在的花园已成了市内美丽的风景区了。
    伊尔库次克现在已有国立大学、师范学院等七所高等学校，二十三所中等技术学校和其他一些中等专业学校，七十六所普通学校和十六所青年工人学校。共有两万多学生在高等学校和中等技术学校里学习。正在培养着四十多种职业的专门人材。应该记得，革命前伊尔库次克全省只有一万五千名男孩子和七千名女孩子受教育，而且其中大部分是进初等小学校。现在，只伊尔库次克市就有四万三千多名中小学生。七千名学龄前儿童共有七十六所幼儿园。
    苏联科学院西伯利亚东部分院是1949年2月在伊尔库次克成立的。此外，市里还有十多所科学研究机关。共有一千多名科学工作人员在高等学校和科学机关里工作着。
    伊尔库次克人喜爱自己的剧院。这里有不久前曾经举行成立一百周年纪念的话剧院、木偶剧院、音乐馆等。市里有九个电影院、二十五个俱乐部和文化馆，一百二十五个群众图书馆。
    当前的五年计划中有很多光荣的任务等待伊尔库次克的劳动者去完成。在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的指示中，西伯利亚东部以及伊尔库次克本身的工业和文化的发展被赋予重要的地位。大家知道，还在1956年7月，伊尔库次克水电站的建设者就拦断了雄伟的安加拉河。安加拉河梯级的初生子——伊尔库次克水电站已发出了便宜的电力（每度电的成本还不到一个戈比），部分电流将输往世界上最大的布拉次克水电站的建筑工地。
    在第六个五年计划年代里，伊尔库次克的工业企业必须保证产量增加60％至70％。这个任务将用建设新工业企业的办法，同时用改善现有设备的利用的办法来完成。伊尔库次克在第六个五年计划时期将要建立的一切大小工厂，是数不胜数的！
    一个新的巨大的学院城已开始建筑。它位于安加拉河的左岸，分布在这里的有矿冶学院、建筑工程学院和工学院。还将建筑教师住宅、学生宿舍、俱乐部、运动场等。我们亲爱的安加拉河畔的伊尔库次克将一天比一天变得更富有、更美丽。安加拉河所拥有的无穷无尽的潜力，也日益用来为苏联人——共产主义的建设者谋福利。
    伊尔库次克市民同外国劳动者的友好关系在逐年加强。伊尔库次克人经常殷勤地接待许多杰出的国务活动家和普通人民——争取和平的战士。
    毛泽东、朱德、周恩来都先后到过伊尔库次克。许许多多的文化代表也来到我们这里作过客。一群实习生——伟大的中国人民的儿子，在伊尔库次克水电站的齐心协力的全体建设者中间出色地工作着。伊尔库次克的居民对中国的艺术和科学都有很大的兴趣。
    中华人民共和国的巨大的成就使我们十分高兴。伊尔库次克的劳动者，也和全体苏联人民一样，充满决心要进一步巩固我们两国人民的伟大的友谊。
