Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 20th: Spring planting has fully commenced in the high-yield rice areas of Longxi and Jinjiang Special Districts in southern Fujian Province. In the earlier-season counties of Longxi, Zhao’an, and two others, over 1,230,000 jin of seeds had been soaked and sown and over 50,000 mu of fields had been flooded and prepared by the 14th. Some direct-sown rice fields also began sowing work on the 13th.

Prior to the spring plowing, agricultural cooperative members in the Longxi and Jinjiang Special Districts had completed or were still working on over 20,000 new and old water conservancy projects, and had accumulated over 230 million dan of fertilizer. During the spring plowing, they are even more prepared to widely promote various yield-increasing technologies and experiences that have been successfully tested over the years. In Longxi County, the “Thousand-Jin Rice County,” the vast majority of the 210,000+ mu of early rice fields will be planted with the “Southern Special” improved variety. The majority of the rice seeds soaked in another “Thousand-Jin Rice County,” Haicheng County, and in Yunxiao, Nanjing, and other counties, have been selected using salt water or mud water. Agricultural cooperatives have universally constructed combined-type seedling fields and are implementing sparse sowing to cultivate strong seedlings, in order to make preparations for the comprehensive promotion of close planting with small seedlings during transplanting.

    福建南部稻谷高产区开始春播
    新华社福州20日电　稻谷高产区福建省南部龙溪、晋江两专区，春耕播种工作已经全面开始。季节较早的龙溪、诏安等四个县，在14日以前已经浸种和播种一百二十三万多斤，放水溶田五万多亩，有些直播稻田也在13日开始了播种工作。
    春耕前，龙溪、晋江两专区的农业社社员们已经完成和还在动工的新、旧水利工程共两万多处，积肥两亿三千多万担。春耕中，他们更有准备和更广泛地推广了历年来试验成功的各种丰产技术和经验。“水稻千斤县”龙溪县的二十一万多亩早稻田，绝大部分将种植“南特号”良种。另一个“水稻千斤县”海澄县和云霄、南靖等县已经浸下的稻种，绝大部分经过盐水或泥水选种；各农业社普遍做了合式秧田，实行稀播培育壮秧，为插秧时全面推广小株密植做好准备。
