    Eye Ailment or Mental Ailment?
    Zheng Tide

    A young female comrade walked into the office of the Organization Department of the CPC Zhejiang Province Zhoushan Prefectural Committee. Judging from her elegant appearance and energetic stride, she was a robust and cheerful person.

    "I'm back," she said with a smile, handing her temporary Party membership certificate to the staff of the Organization Department.

    "Ready to work?" asked the comrade from the Organization Department.

    "Not yet!"

    "Isn't your illness better yet? Do you still need to see a doctor!"

    "Of course, I need to see a doctor!" With that, she strode out of the office.

    Who is she? She is Communist Party member Gao Lianying, the wife of Li Pinu, Secretary of the CPC Zhoushan Prefectural Committee. She is a person who draws a salary from the state but claims to be ill and has not worked for more than three years. This time, she stayed in Beijing for nearly a year under the pretext of seeking medical treatment before returning.

    It seems she is a person who knows how to rest very well. In the summer of 1953, Gao Lianying was transferred from Ningbo to Zhoushan. Before being assigned a job, she claimed to have an eye ailment and began a life of leisure. In a spacious and comfortable building, she dressed up and went out for strolls. When she got tired, she came back and took a long nap in bed. In the evening, she dressed up even more meticulously, full of energy. Her well-fitting clothes, paired with two braids tied with bows, made her look both pretty and elegant. Then she would float off to the cinema or theater. Sometimes, she would accompany her husband to the famous Mount Putuo to visit historical sites, or she would travel to Hangzhou under the pretext of seeking medical treatment for her eye ailment.

    Several months passed. The comrades in the Organization Department saw that Gao Lianying's eyes were not that bad, so they prepared to assign her work and talked to her: "If you continue like this, it's really dangerous! All you know is how to play, and you don't do any work, so you completely lose sensitivity to new things. Your eye ailment is not serious. Assigning you work will allow you to treat it while working." "Ugh! If I work, my eyes won't hold up! I feel fine when I get up in the morning, but I get dizzy after reading for half an hour..." Accompanying the gentle explanation was a soft smile. Life went on as usual.

    After some time, the comrades from the CPC Zhoushan Prefectural Committee Organization Department talked to her again: "We're assigning you to be the director of a nursery. It won't affect your eye ailment. You did this job in Ningbo before." However, she still said: "I haven't considered working yet. I need to rest for a period of time to treat my eyes, and then I'll ask the organization to consider my work." Some of the responsible comrades of the prefectural committee who lived with her also talked to her, asking her to be the director of the nursery, but the answer they received was: "Children are noisy, adults are shouting... I've had enough of it, I won't do it!" She almost lost her temper.

    Later, after a very long period of consideration, she was still not ready to work. She said to others behind their backs: "There are conditions for me to work: first, I won't read documents; second, I won't go to the countryside; third, I won't use my brain." Heavens! Where can you find such a job? The first two conditions can be reluctantly accommodated, but the last condition—not using your brain—which line of revolutionary work can you not use your brain? In fact, how cleverly she uses her brain to avoid work and indulge in enjoyment!

    After a long time, opinions from below were numerous. The prefectural committee Organization Department talked to Gao Lianying again and decided to assign her work. This stumped her again. After the conversation, she remained silent and returned unhappily. In the end, her husband, Li Pinu, Secretary of the CPC Zhoushan Prefectural Committee, came forward to negotiate. He found the Minister of the Prefectural Committee Organization Department and said, "Gao Lianying's eyes are almost better, let her rest for another period of time!" The words of the Secretary of the Prefectural Committee naturally took effect. But after a long time, Gao Lianying was still resting.

    In this way, more than three years of lazy life have caused Gao Lianying to completely lose her sense of new things. The comrades who lived with her told her several times: the prefectural committee is making a work report today, it would be good for you to sit and listen. She simply answered that she wouldn't go. When attending Party group meetings, she was only perfunctory. When the group asked her to study Party documents, she replied that she couldn't read them.

    The surrounding cadres are becoming increasingly angry with this idle person who takes the people's money and does no work. After the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign was launched, everyone said: Gao Lianying can watch four hours of Yue opera in the evening, so why can't she do some work? This is a waste of manpower. The comrades of the CPC Zhoushan Discipline Inspection Commission wrote to Prefectural Committee Secretary Li Pinu in order to save her, reflecting the opinions of the comrades and kindly put forward two suggestions: (1) If she is indeed ill, she should be approved to go to the hospital for specialized treatment. Wandering around will never cure her; (2) If her illness is not serious, she can be appropriately assigned work to work while treating it in the workplace. Soon, Li Pinu's reply came, and the beginning was so sincere and humble: "...This problem, I am very ashamed...", followed by two proposed solutions: (1) Her work will be handled by Section Chief Li (Cadre Section Chief) of the Prefectural Committee Organization Department; (2) Her illness will be resolved by Section Chief Wang (Health Section Chief) of the Commissioner's Office. What is strange is that Comrade Yang, Secretary of the CPC Zhoushan Prefectural Committee's office, knew about the letter written by Li Pinu. He was afraid that this would offend Secretary Li Pinu's work "emotions," so he specifically announced at the Party branch secretary and group leader meeting: "Comrade Gao Lianying is unable to work due to illness. Please explain to the cadres," and he specially added the sentence "First unify our thinking within the Party." May I ask: What is the result of such "unifying our thinking"?

    At this time—in July 1955, Prefectural Committee Secretary Li Pinu went to the Central Senior Party School in Beijing to study, and Gao Lianying was also approved to go to Beijing to treat her eye ailment under the pretext of taking care of the Prefectural Committee Secretary. After the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital checked her eyesight using a vision chart, it proved that her vision was 1.5 (able to see the tenth grid). The doctors told her about her condition: This is a problem with the optic nerve. Usually, pay more attention to nutrition, rest properly, and you can work while paying attention to treatment, and it will slowly get better. Western medicine had no new tricks, so she went to find a Chinese medicine doctor. The famous Chinese medicine doctor Yao Heqing from Shanghai happened to be in Beijing, so Gao Lianying asked Dr. Yao to diagnose her. After taking Chinese medicine, Gao Lianying herself said that her eye ailment had indeed improved a lot. Dr. Yao returned to Shanghai, and she maintained contact with Dr. Yao, who sent prescriptions to buy medicine in Beijing.

    Beijing, this city that is boiling with socialist construction everywhere and symbolizes victory, did not inspire Gao Lianying at all. She continued to enjoy herself freely, first staying in a hotel, and then staying in the guest house of the Ministry of Agriculture. Usually, she went out to play and watch operas alone. On Sundays, her husband came back, and she accompanied her husband to play together. Comrades who went to Beijing from Zhoushan saw her and kindly advised her: "You are a Communist Party member, it is dangerous to continue like this! You don't know anything about domestic and foreign affairs. It would be good to subscribe to a newspaper or at least listen to the radio." It is said that Gao Lianying herself also lamented: "When I went south, I was originally assigned to be the director of the Women's Federation in Yin County, but at that time, in order to take care of him (referring to Li Pinu, who was then the mayor of Ningbo), I didn't go and stayed to work in Ningbo City..." She also said that Li Pinu never talked to her about work-related matters when he came home, which was looking down on her. At that time, it caused a burst of pain in her heart, but it was only a flash in the pan and was immediately replaced by a muddled and confused life.

    In June 1956, Li Pinu finished his studies in Beijing and went to Hangzhou to recuperate, and Gao Lianying followed him to Hangzhou. After staying in a guest house in Hangzhou for a month, she returned to Zhoushan. After returning, the Zhoushan Prefectural Committee Organization Department talked to her again: "If you don't want to work, then be a family member!" "My illness hasn't gotten better yet," she replied quickly. Because she knew that being a family member not only would not get the full salary of a 20th-grade cadre, but the travel expenses for going out would also not be reimbursed. The round-trip fare to Beijing and the hotel, guest house, and medical expenses in Beijing alone amounted to more than six hundred yuan.

    Just as Gao Lianying was in trouble, Li Pinu wrote a letter to the Prefectural Committee, followed by a second letter, asking Gao Lianying to go. So Gao Lianying stayed in Hangzhou with him.

    眼病还是心病？
    郑悌德
    一个年轻的女同志走进了中共浙江省舟山地委组织部的办公室。从她雅致的外表和有力的步伐看来，她是一个健壮而又愉快的人。
    “我回来了”，她笑嘻嘻地把党员临时证明信交给组织部工作人员。
    “可以工作了吧？”组织部的同志问。
    “还早呢！”
    “你的病还没有好吗？还得再去医啰！”
    “当然要去医呀！”说着，她就咕咚咕咚地走出了办公室。
    她是谁？她是共产党员高莲英，中共舟山地委书记李频如的爱人。她是拿国家发给的工资而推说有病三年多不工作的人。这次她以医病为名在北京住了将近一年才回来。
    看来，她是一位很会休息的人。1953年夏天，高莲英从宁波调到舟山，还没有分配工作，就推说眼睛有病过起休息的生活来了。在一间宽敞舒适的楼房里，她打扮完毕，就出外游逛。逛累了回来，躺在床上睡一大觉。到了晚上，又精神百倍地更精心地打扮起来，合体的衣衫，配上两条扎着蝴蝶结的辫子，又漂亮又大方。于是就飘飘然去电影院或戏院了。有时候，她随着爱人去著名的普陀山游览古迹，或以医眼病为名到杭州游逛。
    几个月过去了，组织部的同志看高莲英的眼睛并不怎么坏，于是就准备分配她工作，找她谈话：“你这样下去，真危险！光知道玩，不做一点工作，对新事物完全失去敏感。你的眼病并不严重，分配你工作，在工作岗位上治疗。”“唔！要我工作，眼睛不行！早晨起床还好，看不上半小时书就发昏……”。随着婉转的解释，是一阵轻轻的微笑。生活还是照常。
    过了些时候，中共舟山地委组织部的同志又找她去谈：“分配你去当托儿所所长，对你的眼病没有妨害，你在宁波也干过这项工作。”可是，她仍然说：“工作，我还没有考虑过，需要休养一个时期，把眼睛治一治，再请组织考虑我的工作。”同她住在一起的地委一些负责同志也和她谈，叫她去当托儿所所长，可是得到的回答却是：“小孩吵，大人叫，……我是干够了，不干！”差一点她就发火了。
    后来，经过很长久的考虑，她还不准备做工作。背后同别人说：“要我做工作是有条件的：一不看文件，二不下乡，三不动脑筋。”天老爷！到哪儿去找这样的工作呢？前两个条件倒还可以勉强照顾，后一个条件——不动脑筋，革命工作那一行可以不动脑筋？事实上，她对逃避工作，贪图享乐的脑筋又是动得多么巧妙呀！
    这样又过了很久，下面意见纷纷，地委组织部又找高莲英谈话，决定分配他工作。这下又把她难住了，谈话后默不作声，满不高兴地回去了。最后，还是由她爱人——中共舟山地委书记李频如出来交涉。他找到地委组织部部长说：“高莲英眼睛快要好了，让她再休息一个时期吧！”地委书记的话自然是生效的。可是又过了许久，高莲英还是在休息着。
    就这样，三年多的懒散生活，使高莲英完全失去了对新事物的嗅觉，同她住在一起的同志曾有几次告诉她：今天地委作工作报告，你去坐着听听也好。她干脆回答不去。参加党的小组会，也不过是应付应付，小组叫她学习党的文件，他回答看不下去。
    周围的干部，对这位游手好闲拿着人民的钱不做工作的挂名干部越来越气愤。增产节约运动开展后，大家说：高莲英能在晚上看四小时的越剧，又为什么不能做点工作？这是人力浪费。中共舟山监委的同志为了挽救她，就写信给地委书记李频如，反映了同志们的意见，并善意提出了两点意见：（一）如确实有病就批准她去医院专门治疗，东逛西游永远治不好；（二）如病不重，可适当分配她工作，在工作岗位上一面工作，一面治疗。不久，李频如的回信来了，开头写得多么诚恳，谦虚：“……这问题，非常惭愧……”，后面提出两个处理办法：（一）她的工作交地委组织部李科长（干部科长）处理；（二）她的病交给专署王科长（卫生科长）解决。令人奇怪的是，李频如写的信被中共舟山地委机关党委书记杨同志知道了，他生怕这次触犯了李频如书记的工作“情绪”，还专门在党支部书记以及小组长会上宣布：“高莲英同志是因病不能工作，请你们向干部作解释”，并特别加上句“首先在党内统一思想”。试问：这样“统一思想”的结果又是什么呢？
    就在这个时候——1955年7月，地委书记李频如去北京中央高级党校学习，在照顾地委书记的名义下批准高莲英也去北京治眼病。北京苏联红十字医院用视力检查表检查她的眼力后，证明她的视力有1.5（能看清第十格）。医师们告诉她病况：这是眼神经方面的毛病，平时多注意营养，适当休息，可以一面工作，一面注意治疗，慢慢会好的。西医没有新花样，她又去找中医。上海的名中医姚和卿刚好在北京，高莲英就请姚医师诊治。吃中药后，高莲英自己也说眼病的确好了许多。姚医师回了上海，她和姚医师仍保持通讯联系，由姚医师寄药方来在北京买药吃。
    北京，这座到处沸腾着社会主义建设，象征着胜利的城市，也没有使高莲英得到一点启发，她继续自由自在地享乐，先住旅馆，后又住在农业部的招待所里。平时，一个人出去玩逛，看戏。星期日，爱人回来了，就陪爱人一道玩。从舟山去北京的同志看到她，曾好心地劝她说：“你是共产党员，这样下去危险呀！国内国外事情什么也不知道，订份报纸看看也好，至少收听收听广播。”据说，高莲英自己也曾惋惜地说：“南下时，本来分配去鄞县当妇联主任，当时为了照顾他（指李频如，当时是宁波市的市长）没有去，留在宁波市工作……”。她还说起李频如回家来从不和她谈起有关工作方面的事，这是看不起她。当时在她心里也引起一阵痛苦，但只不过是昙花一现，马上又被昏昏沉沉、糊糊涂涂的生活代替了。
    1956年6月，李频如北京学习结束，到杭州养病，高莲英也跟着到了杭州。在杭州住了一个月招待所才回到舟山。回来后，舟山地委组织部又找她谈话：“你不想做工作，就当家属吧！”“病还没有好。”她回答得很快。因为她知道当家属不但不能拿到二十级干部的全部薪金，出外的旅费也不能报销了。单这次去北京的路费和在北京的旅馆费、住招待所费以及医药费就达六百多元。
    正在高莲英为难的时候，李频如给地委写来一封信，接着又来了第二次信，要求叫高莲英去。于是高莲英又住在杭州陪伴着他了。
