    Spring Festival at the Nanwangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, Initiated by Three Poor Peasant Households
                Xinhua News Agency Reporter Deng Zichang
    The Nanwangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, initiated by three poor peasant households, suffered a severe flood last year, resulting in a significant reduction in production. Would this affect the members' celebration of the festival and lower their living standards? Would it dampen the members' enthusiasm for running the cooperative? To answer these questions, the reporter visited Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang, the three poor peasants who insisted on taking the path of cooperation, as well as many other members, from the 30th day of the twelfth lunar month to the second day of the first lunar month, and spent the Spring Festival happily with them.
        The Joy of the Festival
    These past few days, the streets and courtyards of Nanwangzhuang, Anping County, Hebei Province, have been swept very clean. People have changed into clean clothes. New Spring Festival couplets have been pasted on the gates of the sixteen families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The members are all happily finding people to talk to. Wang Yukun, the director of the cooperative, told the reporter that if advanced cooperation had not been achieved last year, people would not have been in the mood to celebrate the Spring Festival after such a severe flood! He said: In the autumn of 1942, this area suffered a drought. Except for a few landlords and rich peasants, most farmers in the village lived by selling their belongings or fleeing the famine to beg for food. Everyone was frowning, and for the Spring Festival, they ate bran and wild vegetables. Last year, there was a severe flood here, but the cooperative promptly organized its members to fight against the flood, rescued some of the crops, and ensured that no houses in the village were washed away. Immediately afterward, it organized members to develop sideline production, which increased the members' income. As a result, the members were able to celebrate the festival happily. Every family wrapped dumplings with white flour and meat filling and also stewed meat dishes.
  Reviewing the Benefits of Running the Cooperative for a Year During the Spring Festival
    Wang Junbo, the secretary of the cooperative, said: Last year was the first year of running the advanced cooperative. Although it suffered a severe flood, it still had a harvest of 30% of a normal year. After the disaster, sideline production was developed, and so far, more than 13,000 yuan has been earned. It is estimated that at least 25,000 yuan can be earned by June this year. Thus, if only agricultural income is calculated, out of the 325 member households in the cooperative, 143 households have no difficulty in making a living, and 182 households are short of grain for one to two seasons. If this sideline money is used to purchase grain, it can help solve the grain shortage for those households and there will be a surplus. At the same time, after the disaster, not only did the members not sell their belongings or flee the famine to beg for food, but the cooperative also had the strength to buy more than a dozen mules and horses.
    Poor peasant member Wang Yunchang used to have insufficient food to eat every year because he had little land and lacked livestock, and his family had many members. He was always downhearted during the Spring Festival. Last year, Wang Yunchang joined the cooperative, and the agricultural income he received, converted into grain, was enough for his whole family to eat. He could also receive some sideline income and was able to celebrate the Spring Festival happily for the first time. His mother was so happy that she told everyone she met, "Since my family joined the cooperative, both men and women have work to do and income to earn. We no longer have to worry about food and clothing."
    Wang Shubo, a middle peasant member, relied on selling wood and clothing to survive the famine after the 1942 drought, and he didn't even have dumplings to eat for the Spring Festival. His family originally had twenty mu of land, most of which was by the river. If he had farmed individually last year, he would definitely have had no harvest, and even if he had a little harvest, it would not have been enough to cover the loss of his house collapsing. However, his family joined the cooperative last year and still received more than 1,700 jin of wheat and corn, 180 jin of peanuts, 50 jin of cotton, and 50 yuan in cash, in addition to sideline income. Thus, his family's income last year was about the same as the year before. Not only did they wrap dumplings and stew meat dishes for the Spring Festival, but they also made a new floral dress for their youngest daughter. His father, Wang Lao Zuo, originally thought that his family had a lot of labor and strong labor, so it was better to farm individually and was afraid of suffering losses by joining the cooperative. Now, Wang Lao Zuo says: "We were able to receive so much last year even after the flood; if there had been no flood, farming twenty mu of land in the cooperative would definitely be better than farming forty mu of land individually."
    Female member Di Lanzhu is even happier during the Spring Festival than others. In the past, Di Lanzhu relied on borrowing grain to live because she didn't work, and people looked down on her. Last year, Di Lanzhu was encouraged by the fair treatment of equal pay for equal work for men and women and more pay for more work in the cooperative, coupled with the education and help from the cadres. For the first time, she worked diligently in the fields, was very active, and was respected by the people. She was elected as the women's production team leader and received a lot of labor remuneration. When the reporter went to congratulate her on the New Year, he saw that she was wearing newly made cotton clothes, there was a coal stove in the room, and she had wrapped many dumplings. She said excitedly that she was really happy to celebrate the festival this year because the grain she received could last until the wheat harvest, and she had woven three homespun cloths (each worth five yuan) in the winter, so she didn't lack pocket money.
          Frugal Festival
    In order to save funds and support production, the members made it a point to have a frugal festival. The cooperative slaughtered more than 130 fat pigs, but because it was decided to eat less pork, 1,500 jin of pork were sold. Members also made less or no new clothes and bought fewer other New Year's goods. In this way, in the short period before the Spring Festival alone, the cooperative used the saved funds to buy back 149 piglets to increase income and accumulate fertilizer. Li Jinyu, an old lady in her seventies, originally planned to make a new set of clothes for each of her daughter-in-law, two granddaughters-in-law, and four grandsons for the Spring Festival, but after Li persuaded and mobilized them, her family decided not to make new clothes and saved more than 20 yuan. They have already used seven yuan to buy a piglet to raise and plan to buy more piglets.
    During the Spring Festival, none of the members were pessimistic or disappointed, and their enthusiasm for running the cooperative was very high. They told the reporter that they would continue to develop sideline production after resting until the fourth day of the new year (sugar house production had already started on the second day), and they would also carry out agricultural activities such as wheat field management, land leveling, and accumulating and transporting manure. They are confident in doing a good job in sideline production and striving to produce more grain, cotton, and peanuts.

    春节在三户贫农带头办起来的南王庄农业社
                新华社记者　邓子常
    以三户贫农带头办起来的南王庄农业社，去年遭受大水灾，严重减产。这是否会影响社员们过节和降低生活水平？是否会挫折社员们的办社热情？为了解答这些问题，记者在农历腊月30到正月初二，访问了坚持走合作化道路的三户贫农王玉坤、王小其和王小庞，以及其他许多社员，和他们一起愉快地度过了春节。
        节日的欢乐
    这几天，河北省安平县南王庄的大街上和房院里，打扫得十分清洁。人们换上了干净的衣服。十六户烈属和军属的大门口，已贴上了新春联。社员们都欢乐地找人谈心。社主任王玉坤告诉记者，要不是去年实现了高级合作化，人们哪能在大水灾后还有心思过春节啊！他说：1942年秋天这里受旱灾，全村除少数地主富农外，一般农民都靠卖东西过活或逃荒要饭。人人愁眉苦脸，过春节吃的是谷糠和野菜。去年这里发大水，合作社及时组织社员向水灾作斗争，抢救出部分庄稼，保住全村房屋没有被水冲倒，紧接着又组织社员开展副业生产，社员收入有了增加，因而社员能欢乐过节，每家都包了白面肉馅的饺子，还炖了肉菜。
  春节回顾办社一年的好处
    合作社的秘书王俊波说：去年是办高级社的第一年，虽然经受了严重水灾，仍有三成年景的收成。灾后搞副业生产，到最近已收入一万三千多元，预计到今年6月最少共可收入二万五千元。这样，只按农业收入计算，全社三百二十五户社员中，有一百四十三户生活没有困难，有一百八十二户缺粮一季到两季。如果用这笔副业款购买粮食，就可帮助缺粮户解决缺粮问题，并有盈余。同时，灾后不仅社员没有卖东西和逃荒要饭的，而且合作社还有力量买了十多头骡马。
    贫农社员王运昌，过去因为地少，缺少牲口，家里人口多，年年打的粮食不够吃，过春节总是垂头丧气的。去年，王运昌入了社，只把分得的农业收入，折成粮食，就够全家作口粮用，同时还可分些副业收入，第一次能够喜喜欢欢地过春节了。他的娘乐得见人就说，我家一入社，男的女的都有活干，都有收入，吃穿不再发愁了。
    中农社员王树波家，1942年受旱灾后，是靠变卖木头和衣物渡荒的，过春节连饺子都没有吃上。他家原有二十亩地，多数在河边，如果去年单干，准会没有收成，即使有点收成，也顶不上倒房的损失。可是，他家去年入了社，仍然分到麦子、玉米等粮食一千七百多斤、花生一百八十斤、棉花五十多斤和五十元现钱，此外还可分到副业款。这样，他家去年的收入和前年差不多，春节不只包了饺子，炖了肉菜，还给小闺女新作了一身花衣裳。他爹王老左，原先认为家里劳力多，劳力强，单干好，怕入社吃亏。现在，王老左说：去年受了水灾，还能分到这么多东西；要是没有水灾，在社里种二十亩地定能比单干种四十亩地还强。
    女社员狄兰珠过春节比别人更加喜欢。过去，狄兰珠因为不劳动，靠借粮食过日子，人们瞧不起她。去年，狄兰珠在社里受到男女同工同酬和多劳多得的合理待遇的鼓舞，加之干部对她的教育和帮助，第一次认真下地生产，干活很积极，受到人们的尊敬，被选为妇女生产队长，得到了不少劳动报酬。记者去向她贺年时，看见她穿上了新作的棉衣服，房里生着煤火炉子，还包了许多饺子。她兴奋地说，今年过节真高兴，因为分的粮可以吃到麦收，冬天自己织了三个土布（每个值五元），零花钱也不缺。
          简朴过节
    社员们为要节约资金，支援生产，作到了简朴过节。全社杀肥猪一百三十多口，因为决定少吃点猪肉，就卖出一千五百斤猪肉。社员们还少做或不做新衣服，少买其他年货等。这样，只春节前的短期内，全社就用节约的资金，买回一百四十九口小猪，用来增加收入和积肥。七十多岁的李金玉老大娘，她的一个儿媳、两个孙媳和四个孙子，原打算过春节每人要作一身新衣服，但经李老大娘说服动员，她家决定不作新衣服，省出二十多元，已用七元买了一口小猪来喂养，还准备再买小猪。
    在春节期间，社员们没有一个悲观失望的，办社热情都很高。他们告诉记者，今年春节休息到初四，就要继续开展副业生产（糖房生产初二已经开始），并要进行麦田管理、平整土地、积肥送粪等农事活动，他们有信心搞好副业生产，争取生产更多的粮食、棉花和花生等。
