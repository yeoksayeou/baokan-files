Xinhua News Agency, Manila, February 2nd: A senior official of the Philippine National Economic Council, Ramirez, accused the Magsaysay government of its policy of excessive reliance on the United States.  When announcing his resignation from the post of acting National Planning Director of the aforementioned committee on the evening of January 31, he said that the government's "colonial mentality" is the "most serious obstacle to the Philippines' economic development." He said, "We are constantly attributing almost all economic achievements to an average of less than 20 million US dollars in aid each year, while the annual investment of Filipinos, which is about twenty times this figure, is completely ignored. This makes it impossible for Filipinos to have a sense of developing the economy."

Senator Recto accused on January 30 that under Magsaysay's regime, the economic situation of the people has deteriorated further. The senator, who will compete with Magsaysay for the presidency in the general election in November this year, said that he will focus on domestic issues such as high cost of living, low purchasing power of the peso (Philippine currency), and high unemployment in his campaign speeches. He said that many people are actually suffering and have difficulty eating one meal a day.

The Senate Committee on Banks, Corporations, and Franchises announced on January 29 that two senators accused the Central Bank of the Philippines of improperly handling the Philippines' foreign exchange reserves. The news said that this money was deposited in First National City Bank of New York, which only gave 1% interest, instead of being deposited in other American banks of equal reputation that gave 2% interest.

    菲政界指责麦格赛赛政府
    过分依赖美国阻碍国家经济发展
    据新华社2日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾全国经济委员会高级官员拉米雷斯指责麦格赛赛政府的过分依赖美国的政策。他在1月31日晚宣布辞去上述委员会的代理国家计划主任一职时说，政府的“殖民地心理”是菲律宾“经济发展的最严重障碍”。他说，我们不断地几乎把一切经济成就都归功于每年平均不到二千万美元的援助，而等于这个数字约二十倍的菲律宾人的每年投资总额却完全被忽视，这样就没有可能使菲律宾人抱有发展经济的意识。
    参议员雷克托1月30日指责说，在麦格赛赛的政权下，人民的经济状况更加恶化。这个将要在今年11月的大选中同麦格赛赛竞选总统的参议员说，他将在自己的竞选演说中着重谈到生活费用高、比索（菲币）购买力低和失业人多等国内问题。他说，很多人实际上是受着苦难，而且一天难于吃到一顿饭。
    参议院银行、公司和特许权委员会1月29日宣布，有两个议员指责菲律宾中央银行对菲律宾外汇储备金处置不当。消息说，这笔钱存入只给1％利息的纽约第一花旗银行而不存在给息2％的同等声名的其他美国银行。
