Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 2nd: The Shaanxi Provincial Commissioners' and County Heads' Conference, which closed on January 29th, put forward the task of striving for a greater harvest in agricultural production this year. The conference decided that the province's grain output this year should increase by 6.3% compared with last year, cotton output should increase by 21.1% compared with last year, and the province's soybeans, oilseeds, large livestock, mountain sheep, pigs, afforestation, tea, fruit trees, silkworms, and other special products should also be comprehensively developed.

Shaanxi Province achieved great results in various agricultural productions last year. The province had bumper harvests of grain and cotton, and many large-area high-yield fields of wheat, cotton, rice, corn, etc., and many "thousand-catty cooperatives" and "thousand-catty mu" appeared. Most rural cadres and agricultural cooperative members are confident in striving for a greater harvest this year. However, according to the conference, some cadres and farmers in rural areas still have conservative ideas and negative emotions. They believe that last year's bumper harvest was due to "favorable weather," and the potential of fertilizers, etc., has been almost exhausted. In particular, many people lack confidence in this year's wheat production increase, believing that the area of ​​wheat fields after the previous crop was large last year, and the drought last winter prevented the wheat roots from taking hold. The root cause of the above-mentioned ideas is mainly the lack of analysis and insufficient estimation of the many favorable factors for Shaanxi Province's agricultural production to obtain a bumper harvest this year. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that in 1956, the province was able to achieve agricultural harvests in a situation where primary cooperation had just been realized and leadership experience in large-scale production was insufficient. At present, 96% of farmers in the province have joined advanced agricultural cooperatives, basically realizing advanced cooperation, and 64% are old cooperatives with conditions for further increasing production.

The conference analyzed the conditions for striving for agricultural production increase this year, believing that: due to the great harvest achieved by the province last year, agricultural cooperatives not only gained experience, but also accumulated a certain amount of public funds, and the difficulty of increasing production investment this year has been reduced. The large-scale technical reform movement carried out last year gave cadres at all levels experience in leading large-area production and agricultural capital construction. Although there were some failures in the promotion of technology last year, even these failures are educational for this year's production leadership. In particular, the area of ​​paddy fields expanded throughout the province last year and the area for soil and water conservation and intercepting sediment loss was one to two times larger than the results of the six years after liberation. The potential of water resources in the province is still great. In the Qinchuan area alone, there are still three million mu of arable land suitable for well drilling, and there are still many rivers and small streams in the mountainous areas that can be diverted for irrigation. These are the favorable conditions for this year.

The conference also pointed out some unfavorable factors in this year's agricultural production. For example, the province is still short of fertilizer, and livestock are weak and thin. The conference believes that as long as the leadership organs at all levels vigorously lead the masses to collect and accumulate fertilizer, protect and breed livestock, these difficulties can be completely overcome. Finally, the conference determined that the province should continue to "focus on water conservancy, focus on fertilizer, focus on labor, and focus on technology" in agricultural production this year. It is necessary to rely on the superior conditions of the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives combined with government assistance to vigorously build water conservancy projects, especially to seize the current favorable opportunity to repair the paddy fields and canals that were not repaired last year, and level the land well, so that they can play a major role this spring. This spring, a large-scale mass fertilizer collection and accumulation campaign should be launched throughout the province, and fertilization methods should be improved to maximize the effectiveness of fertilizers, and so on. The conference also particularly emphasized that this year it is necessary to vigorously help the people in mountainous areas develop diversified economies, improve farming methods in mountainous areas, and change the serious soil erosion in mountainous areas.

The conference also determined that豐产布局 should be carried out throughout the province this year to establish豐产 banners. In each county, two types of high-yield single crops that are 10% higher than the original plan should be cultivated. In fourteen counties, more than 600,000 mu of large-area high-yield cotton fields with an average yield of 100 catties of lint cotton per mu should be cultivated. In each county in the province, two to three comprehensive grain crop high-yield townships with an average yield per mu 10% higher than the originally planned yield and 15% higher than the output of the surrounding townships should be cultivated. In each county, three to five agricultural cooperatives that produce a thousand catties per mu should be cultivated.

In order to mobilize all positive forces, the conference decided to quickly launch a massive mass agricultural production campaign throughout the province.

    陕西决定迅速掀起农业大生产运动
    农业社的经济力量比去年大，干部的领导经验比过去多，水利资源潜力还大，对这些有利条件应当充分运用
    新华社西安2日电　1月29日闭幕的陕西省专员、县长会议，提出了争取今年农业生产获得更大的丰收的任务。这个会议决定：陕西全省今年的粮食产量要求比去年增加6.3％，棉花产量比去年增长21.1％，并使全省的大豆、油料、大家畜、山绵羊、猪、造林和茶叶、果树、蚕桑及其他特产也全面发展起来。
    陕西省在去年的各项农业生产中，都获得了很大的成绩。全省的粮食、棉花丰收，并出现了很多小麦、棉花、水稻、玉米等大面积丰产田和许多千斤社、千斤亩。一般农村干部和农业社社员对于争取今年更大的丰收都具有信心。但是，根据会议反映，农村中仍有部分干部和农民有保守思想和消极情绪。他们认为去年丰收是由于“风调雨顺”，而肥料等潜力也已经挖得差不多了。特别是有许多人对今年的小麦增产缺乏信心，认为去年的回茬麦田面积大，加之去冬干旱，麦根没有扎好。产生上述思想的根源主要是对今年陕西省农业生产能获得丰收的许多有利因素缺乏分析和估计不足。经过讨论一致认为：1956年全省在刚刚实现初级合作化和领导大生产经验不足的情况下，还能获得农业丰收，而目前全省加入高级农业社的农户已经达到96％，基本上实现了高级合作化，而且64％是老社，有进一步增产的条件。
    会议分析了争取今年农业增产的条件，认为：由于全省去年获得了很大的丰收，农业社不仅有了经验，而且有了一定数量的公共积累，今年增产投资的困难减少了。去年开展了大规模的技术改革运动，使各级干部有了领导大面积生产和农业基本建设的经验。去年在推广技术中虽有一些失败教训，但就是这些失败教训对今年在领导生产上也有教育意义。特别是全省去年扩大的水田面积和开展水土保持拦蓄泥沙流失的面积比解放后六年的成绩扩大了一倍到两倍。全省水利资源的潜力还大，仅秦川地区宜于打井的耕地即还有三百万亩，山区也还有许多河流和小溪可以引进来进行灌溉。这些就是今年的有利的条件。
    会议也指出了今年农业生产上的一些不利的因素。例如，目前全省肥料还很缺乏，牲畜乏瘦等。会议认为，各级领导机关只要大力领导群众进行搜肥积肥和保护、繁殖牲畜，这些困难是完全可以克服的。最后，这次会议确定今年全省在农业生产上应继续“抓水利、抓肥料、抓劳力、抓技术”。必须依靠农业社的集体力量的优越条件结合政府的扶助，大力兴修水利，特别要抓住当前的有利时机，把去年没有修好的水田、渠道修好，土地平整好，使其在今春发挥重大效益。在今年春天，在全省范围内要开展一个规模巨大的搜肥积肥运动，并改进施肥方法，发挥肥料的效益，等等。会议还特别强调今年要大力帮助山区人民发展多种经济，改进山区耕作方法，改变山区水土流失严重的情况。
    会议还确定今年要在全省范围内进行丰产布局，以便树立丰产旗帜。在每一个县要培养两种比原计划高10％的单一高额作物。在十四个县内培养六十多万亩平均每亩产一百斤皮棉的大面积丰产棉田。在全省每一个县培养两个至三个平均每亩产量比原订计划的产量高10％和比周围乡的产量高15％的全面粮食作物丰产乡。在每县培养三到五个每亩产千斤的农业社。
    为了调动一切积极力量，会议决定在全省范围内迅速掀起一个声势浩大的群众性的农业大生产运动。
