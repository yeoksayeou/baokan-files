Rural Survey:

    The Past and Present of Rural Family Life in the Suburbs of Beijing	By Li Jinghan
    Editor's Note: The author of this article, Li Jinghan, is a professor at Renmin University of China, specializing in social research for over thirty years, with extensive experience and writings. Thirty years ago, he conducted social surveys in villages such as Heishanhu, Guajiatun, Malianwa, and Dongcun in the suburbs of Beijing, and wrote the book "Rural Families in the Suburbs of Beiping". Last autumn, at the request of this newspaper, the author revisited villages such as Guajiatun and Malianwa to conduct interviews and wrote this survey report. This report, through a special survey of farmers' family life, outlines the past and present situation of rural areas in Beijing. It tells people what the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing ate, wore, and lived in thirty years ago, and what their spiritual life was like; and what changes have taken place in these aspects thirty years later. The author said he would like to offer this survey report as a gift for this year's Spring Festival.

    In my past sixty years of life, I have been in constant contact with the family life of rural Beijing. During my time teaching "Social Survey Work and Internship" at Yenching University, Agricultural University, and Tsinghua University, I conducted some field surveys in the villages near the three universities. Among the things I have published are "The Situation of Rural Areas in Jingzhao", "The Poverty of Beijing" and "Rural Families in the Suburbs of Beiping". Due to the lack of class analysis knowledge at that time, I was unable to reflect the essence of things, nor could I clearly understand the root of poverty, and therefore, I could not draw correct conclusions. These old materials only revealed some superficial phenomena and left a tragic film in my impression. After liberation, I have not had contact with families in the suburbs of Beijing for a long time. Last autumn, I accepted a comrade's suggestion to go and observe the peasant families I was familiar with in the past. Before going to the countryside, I went through some related old records. Immediately, my mind was filled with all kinds of memories, and even many impressions from my childhood were vivid. It is said that in recent years, the lives of suburban residents have changed greatly. But to what extent has the change been? Many questions filled my mind. So, on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I began to observe the villages I surveyed in 1926 (that is, thirty years ago), mainly Guajiatun and Malianwa near the Old Summer Palace, focusing on the actual life of the residents. According to appropriate proportions, I visited more than thirty households that originally belonged to various class components and now have different family economic situations. I conducted more careful conversations and in-depth experiences with typical families that can represent the general living standards. The patient cooperation of the folks I contacted this time made my nagging conversations that got to the bottom of things into pleasant conversations. The room, both on and off the kang, often burst into laughter. Often after talking until late at night, the folks would accompany me to the edge of the village and say "Welcome to come again" before saying goodbye. On the silent journey of dozens of miles back, I pondered what I saw and heard, and even if I dreamed, it was a good dream. After New Year's Day this year, I went back to re-examine and re-verified the sorted materials, especially the basic figures, with all parties, and revised and supplemented them to make them more in line with the actual situation of the whole year of 1956, and greatly compressed the original manuscript to write this report.

    Picking up the pen, I really feel overwhelmed and don't know where to start. The first thing I feel is "This trip was not in vain." In this visit, the folks gave me knowledge and inspiration, which was like attending a rich and informative class. If a person has never observed their past living conditions, or has only been in contact with them since liberation, their feelings will probably be very different from mine. Because I am so familiar with their past life, but so unfamiliar with their life in the past seven years, it seems that I have suddenly come from one world to another - although it is still the same village, and even the households I encountered are the same old households. What I feel overwhelmed by is not only that the surface phenomena of the past and present are very different, but also that the essence of things inside is even more different. Seeing the new appearance of today's life, and recalling the old appearance of the past life, in contrast to the two, as long as one has normal humanity, I think one cannot help but feel surprised. The villages I saw in the past were like a few withered fruit trees; and what I see today, although not yet in full bloom, is indeed lush with green branches and leaves, full of flower buds, about to bloom with bright flowers and hang with fruitful fruits. The situation thirty years ago made many people feel "doubtful that there is no road ahead"; and today, thirty years later, it really makes me feel like I have stepped into "another village with bright flowers and shaded willows".

    A Comparison of Past and Present Impressions

    In what aspects did it make me so surprised and so moved? Let me first give a bird's-eye view of some of the impressions that are active in my mind, in the order of what I felt first. Thirty years ago, I could only rely on walking to get to these villages, but now there are flat roads near the villages. In the past, residents were almost indifferent to politics; today, on the first day I arrived in Guajiatun, the villagers were in a jubilant gathering with gongs and drums, exercising their glorious right to be masters of their own affairs, and elected the people's representatives they were satisfied with. In the past, when passing by the fields, I noticed that flocks of sparrows were eating the ears of grain all over the ground, but now the "old thieves" are much less. In the past, I was surrounded by a pack of dogs every time I entered the village, and I had to fight and walk away, but now I "often hear the rooster crowing, but don't hear the dog barking", and I can walk freely. Because in the past, every household was closely guarded against theft at night, but now the petty thieves have disappeared, and there is no need for guard dogs. In the past, I often encountered beggars with disheveled hair and dirty faces, but now I can't see them. In the past, many of the men, women, old and young I met wore clothes with patches upon patches, and most of the children were stark naked. Now, adults generally wear clothes with few patches or semi-new clothes, and most of the children go to school neatly dressed. In the past, when visiting families, many of the residents I met became more and more sad and sighed, and the content was mostly complaints, and at the end of the conversation, they often felt like they had reached the end of the road. The people I met in this visit mostly had smiles on their faces, and the more they talked, the better their spirits became. The content was mostly good news, and they often expressed a belief that their future life would be even better when they said goodbye. How could I be indifferent to these two completely different atmospheres!

    In the past, when I entered an ordinary house, I felt very uneasy when the host made tea for me, because this was a "luxury" stored for distinguished guests, and I was also quite worried about whether the pot and bowls were hygienic. Only for the sake of hospitality and to help with the investigation, I would drink it all. Thirty years later, when I visited this family again, the flies that filled the room in my memory were so few that they did not attract attention, and I could safely drink the tea that they usually used. In the past, when I went to visit farmers' families and sat on the edge of the kang to talk, bedbugs and fleas sometimes crawled into my clothes, biting and串，and small mosquitoes flew on my neck and bit a few times, and I would often bring lice home. In this visit today, these pests that plagued the working people have been unprecedentedly reduced in people's homes and bodies, and have been almost completely eliminated in many families. Not only has "more lice don't itch" become a thing of the past, but also the old saying that "more debts don't worry" is no longer applicable today. Farmers no longer have to hide everywhere or even hang themselves on New Year's Eve because they are forced to pay debts to Yama, but can happily celebrate the Spring Festival.

    In the lives of these families, countless changes, big and small, clearly reflect: as long as the social system of people exploiting people is eradicated, all kinds of sinful phenomena will disappear without a trace, at most temporarily lingering. Due to the great changes in production relations, production technology, and material living conditions, the ideological consciousness, spiritual life, and other aspects of rural residents have also undergone significant changes that are fundamentally different from the past. In the past, not only ordinary people, but even landlords and rich peasants lived a life of mental insecurity, even worrying day and night. Today, even landlords and rich peasants admit that every family is living a peaceful life with peace of mind, and everyone's life is guaranteed. This is something I never dreamed of, but I actually saw it with my own eyes today. If this is not a miracle, what is a miracle? Haven't all patriots always aimed to improve people's lives? Isn't the fundamental purpose of socialists to achieve the maximum satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the people? This visit made me truly feel that this most needed and urgently pursued thing by mankind is being increasingly fulfilled in the lives of the residents of these villages. What specific facts have made me, who has always observed things with a calm mind and an objective attitude, so surprised by the changes I have discovered this time? This is what I want to introduce below, some of the statistics I obtained from this visit.　　(To be continued)

### 北京郊区乡村家庭生活的今昔

    北京郊区乡村家庭生活的今昔	李景汉
    编者按　本文作者李景汉是中国人民大学的教授，专门研究和从事社会调查工作已三十多年，有丰富的经验和著作。三十年前，他曾在北京郊区的黑山扈、挂甲屯、马连洼、东村等村庄进行社会调查，写成“北平郊外之乡村家庭”一书。去年秋季，作者应本报的要求，又到了挂甲屯、马连洼等几个村庄进行调查访问，写了这个调查报告。这个报告通过农民家庭生活的专题调查，钩画出京郊农村今昔的面貌。它告诉人们，三十年前的昔日，京郊农民吃的是什么，穿的是什么，住的是什么样子，精神生活怎么样；三十年后的今天，这些方面有了什么样的变化。作者说愿把这个调查报告作为今年春节的一份献礼。
    在我过去六十多年的生活中，与北京乡村的家庭生活是常接触的。在燕京大学、农业大学和清华大学担任“社会调查工作与实习”这门功课的时期，曾在三校附近的乡村做过一些实地调查。在所发表过的东西里，有“京兆农村的状况”、“北京的穷相”和“北平郊外之乡村家庭”。由于当时缺乏阶级分析的知识，未能反映出来事物的本质，也认识不清贫困的根源，也就当然得不出正确的结论。这些旧资料仅仅揭露了一些表面的现象，并在我的印象里留下了一部悲剧的影片。解放后，我很久没有和京郊的家庭发生接触了。在才过去的秋季，我接受了一位同志的意见，再去观察一下以往熟悉的农家。下乡前，我翻阅了一些有关的陈年记录。立刻在我的脑子里充满了种种的回忆，连小儿时期的很多印象也都历历在目。据说，这几年来郊区居民家庭的生活大大地变了样儿了。可是变化究竟大到了什么程度呢？许多的问号涌满心头。于是，就在中秋节的前夕，开始去观察我在1926年（也就是三十年前）所调查过的几个村庄，主要是圆明园附近的挂甲屯和马连洼，着重观察居民的实际生活。我按照适当的比重，在原属各阶级成分及现在家庭经济情况有所不同的农户中，访问了三十多家，对于能够代表一般生活水平的典型人家，格外进行了较为仔细的交谈和深入的体验。这次所接触的老乡们的耐心合作，竟使我打破沙锅问到底的啰嗦的谈话，成为愉快的交谈。满屋子炕上炕下，常常发出哈哈大笑。往往谈到深夜以后，老乡们还陪我到村边，说声“欢迎再来”而告别。在万籁俱静的几十里归途中，我默思着所见所闻，即或是作梦也是好梦。今年元旦一过，我又去复查了一回，把整理过的材料，尤其是基本的数字，向各方面重新印证了一次，加以修正补充，使更加切合1956年全年的实际情况，并将原稿大为压缩，写成这篇报道。
    拿起笔来，真觉千头万绪，不知下笔何处。我首先感到的是“不虚此行”。在这次访问中，老乡们给我的认识和启发，真如上了一次内容丰富的大课。如果一个人从来没有观察过他们昔日的生活状态，或从解放后就同他们有所接触，他的感觉多半和我的大不一样。由于我对他们过去的生活面貌是那样的熟悉，而对于近七年以来的生活面貌却是如此的陌生，因此我好像是从一个世界突然来到另一个世界——虽然还是那同一个乡村，甚至所碰到的住户也是原先的老住户。不胜今昔之感的，不仅是前后事物的表面现象大不一样了，而且事物内部的本质更是不可同日而语了。看到今日生活的新面貌，再回忆昔日生活的旧面貌，在两相对照之下，只要是一个具有正常人性的人，我想不能不有惊奇之感。我在昔日所见到的这几个村庄，真好像几株枯萎的果树；而今日所见到的，虽然尚未花枝招展，而已确是青枝绿叶、花苞满树，即将开放艳艳鲜花、挂上累累果实了。三十年前的那种局面，曾使不少的人有“山穷水尽疑无路”之感，而在三十年后的今天，竟使我真如踏入了“柳暗花明又一村”。
    今昔印象的对比
    到底在哪些方面竟至使我这样惊异这样感动呢？让我先鸟瞰式的把在我脑海中活跃着的一部分印象，以所感受的先后为序，列举出来。三十年前，我只能多靠步行去到这一带村庄，而现在附近村边都有平坦的公路了。在过去，居民对政治几乎漠不相关；在今日，当我到挂甲屯的第一天，村民们正在锣鼓喧天的盛会上，行使当家作主的光荣权利，选出了他们认为满意的人民代表。在过去，经过田边的时候，我理会到遍地成群的麻雀大吃谷穗，而现在所见的“老家贼”少得多了。过去是每逢进村就被群狗包围，且战且走，而现在是“常听鸡鸣，不闻犬吠”，可以畅行无阻了。因为过去家家在夜间紧防被偷，而现在小贼绝迹，也就用不着看家狗了。过去常常碰到蓬首垢面的乞丐，现在看不见了。在过去，遇到的男女老少，很多都穿着补丁落补丁的衣服，多数儿童是一丝不挂。现在，大人们一般穿着补丁不多或半新的衣裳，而儿童多半穿得整整齐齐的上学了。从前在访问家庭的时候碰到的一般居民，很多是越说越愁眉苦脸咳声叹气起来，内容多是诉苦情，在谈话结束的时候常有日暮途穷之感。在这次访问中所遇到的人们，多是面带笑容的，越谈兴致越佳，内容多是报喜事，时常在他们最后表示出一种相信将来的生活一定更为美好的情景中告别。这两种今昔截然不同的气氛，我怎能无动于衷！
    在过去，当我进入一个普通人家，主人为我烧茶的时候，我很觉不安，因为这是为贵客储存的“奢侈品”，再者我对于壶碗的是否卫生颇不放心。只是为了盛意难却和有助于调查，才一饮而尽。三十年后的今天，我又去访问这户人家的时候，回忆中的满屋苍蝇，少得引不起注意了，能安然地喝着他们自己平日常用的茶了。在过去，我去访问农民家庭，坐在炕沿上谈话的时候，有时爬入衣内的臭虫跳蚤，连咬带串，还有小蚊虫飞在脖子上叮上几口，也往往会把虱子带回家里。在今日这次的访问中，这些烦扰劳动人民的害虫，在人们的屋内和身上是空前地减少着，在不少的家庭里面几乎完全被消除了。不仅“虱子多了不咬”已成过去，就是“账多了不愁”的老话儿在今日也不适用了。农民已无须在除夕被讨阎王债的逼得满处藏躲甚至上吊，而能够欢欢乐乐的过春节了。
    在这些家庭的生活里面，许许多多说不尽的变化，事无巨细，都很清楚地反映着：只要人剥削人的社会制度被铲除以后，种种的罪恶现象都会随之无影无踪，至多一时苟延残喘。由于生产关系、生产技术、物质生活条件等方面的巨大变化，乡村居民的思想意识、精神生活等方面都跟着发生了与过去根本不同的显著变化。过去，不仅一般人家，就连地主富农在内，都过着精神不安，甚至日夜提心吊胆的生活。今日，连地主富农也承认，家家都过着心神安定的太平日子，人人的生活得到了保障。这使我一生梦想不到的事情，竟会在今天亲眼看到了。如果这不是奇迹，什么才算奇迹？向来一切爱国者不都是旨在改善人民的生活么？社会主义者的根本目的不更是要达到最大限度的满足人民的物质生活和文化生活的需要么？这次的访问，使我实实在在地感觉到，这个人类最需要和迫切追求的东西，正在这些村庄的居民生活里面日益充实地实现着。究竟还有什么具体的事实，使我这个一向以冷静头脑和抱客观态度来观察事物的人，对于这次所发见的变动大为吃惊呢？这就是我要在下面介绍的我这次访问所得到的一部分统计数字。　　（未完）
