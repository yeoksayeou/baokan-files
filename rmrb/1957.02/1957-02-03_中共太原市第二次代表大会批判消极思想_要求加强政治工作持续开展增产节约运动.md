Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 2nd: The Second Congress of the CPC Taiyuan City Committee focused its discussion on how to overcome negative thinking and promote a vigorous and sustained Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.

    The 450 delegates discussed the CPC Taiyuan City Committee's report on "Vigorously Developing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement to Strive for the Successful Completion of the First Five-Year Plan." In their discussions, the delegates used concrete and vivid facts and experiences to illustrate the current low quality and waste phenomena in production and construction, and pointed out the enormous potential for developing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. The delegates believed that many people, even some Party members and cadres, have not thoroughly understood the great significance of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. They are satisfied with the achievements made in current industrial and agricultural production and construction, and one-sidedly emphasize the improvement of personal lives. Some even think that annual and monthly economy drives leave no "fat" to be squeezed. These erroneous thoughts and understandings have generated a sense of fatigue and passive labor among some workers, becoming the main obstacle to a vigorous and sustained Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement.

    The delegates analyzed and examined the changes in the Taiyuan City worker ranks and the shortcomings in the Party's work. They believe that with the rapid expansion of the worker ranks, people with various non-proletarian elements have joined, bringing with them various non-proletarian thoughts. The phenomena of mutual disrespect and lax labor discipline, consciously or unconsciously exposed by them, have already had an adverse impact on production and unity. However, the Party's political and ideological education work has not been able to adapt to this changing need in a timely manner. In publicizing the relationship between developing production and improving personal lives, it has also neglected to explain to the workers that improving living standards should be gradual. Certain shortcomings in the implementation of the Party's economic policies have also fueled the individualism of some workers.

    The Congress believes that the key to ensuring the smooth development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement lies in strengthening the Party's political and ideological education work, thereby placing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement on the basis of the masses' consciousness. Therefore, it requires leading cadres at all levels to personally take action, actively publicize to the masses, and fully utilize the role of the propaganda network, so that the broad masses can correctly understand the great significance of Increase Production and Practice Economy. In propaganda and education work, we must be good at helping the masses to correctly understand the relationship between individual interests and overall interests, temporary interests and long-term interests, and democracy and centralization through various methods of self-education, and repeatedly explain the principle that unilaterally emphasizing the improvement of personal lives, apart from the existing level of production, is also contrary to the collective and fundamental interests of the people.

    The meeting believes that while strengthening the Party's political work, it is necessary to correctly implement the Party's economic policies in enterprises. It is necessary to prevent the one-sided production viewpoint of neglecting product quality and project quality for the sake of economy or speed. We must be very cautious in implementing wage, labor quota, and reward policies. At present, we must carefully revise those labor quotas that are too high or too low through detailed investigation and research, so that they adhere to the average advanced level. At the same time, adjustments should also be made so that the reward policy can promote more and faster production, and even more promote good and economical production; it can not only encourage the advanced, but also promote the backward to become advanced.

    The Congress pointed out that in order to fully utilize the combat role of Party organizations in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, it is necessary to further improve the Party's leadership style and strengthen the leadership of grassroots Party organizations. Party organizations at all levels must continue to oppose the bureaucratic style of ignoring the welfare of workers, must study major policy and ideological issues, and overcome the style of focusing only on routine matters. Strengthen investigation and research work, strengthen the analysis of the current situation, in order to correctly implement the instructions of higher authorities. Major issues studied by the Party committee should be fully implemented through the strength of the Party organization, and generally adhere to the working procedure of Party members first, then non-Party members. Regularly convene Party representative meetings and Party congresses to improve the level of Party democratic life. The Congress emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of branch work and improve Party organizational life, carry out criticism and self-criticism at any time, and overcome adverse tendencies. The employee representative system should be implemented in enterprises to attract a wider range of people to participate in enterprise management.

    This meeting was held from January 24th to 27th.

    中共太原市第二次代表大会批判消极思想
    要求加强政治工作持续开展增产节约运动
    新华社太原2日电　中共太原市第二次代表大会着重讨论了如何克服消极思想，使增产节约运动热烈地持续地开展的问题。
    四百五十名代表讨论了中共太原市委关于“大力开展增产节约运动，为完满地完成第一个五年计划而奋斗”的报告。代表们在讨论中用具体的生动的事实和经验，说明当前生产建设中的质量不高和浪费现象，并且指出当前有极大潜力来开展增产节约运动。代表们认为，目前仍有不少群众甚至某些党员和干部没有彻底理解增产节约运动的巨大意义。满足于现在工业、农业生产建设取得的成就，片面地强调个人生活的改善。还有的认为年年节约、月月节约就没有“油水”了。这些错误的思想和认识在某些职工中产生了工作疲沓和劳动消极的情绪，成为热烈地、持久地开展增产节约运动的主要障碍。
    代表们分析和检查了太原市工人队伍变化的情况和党的工作中的缺点。他们认为，随着工人队伍的迅速扩大，各种非无产阶级成分的人加入了工人队伍，带来了各种各样的非无产阶级思想。他们自觉或不自觉地暴露出来的互相不尊重和劳动纪律松弛的现象已经给生产和团结带来了不良影响。可是，党的政治思想教育工作没有能及时地适应这个变化的需要。在宣传发展生产和改善个人生活的关系时，还忽视了向工人群众解释改善生活应该是渐进的。在执行党的经济政策中的某些缺点，也助长了一些职工的个人主义思想。
    大会认为，保证增产节约运动的顺利开展的重要环节在于加强党的政治思想教育工作，从而把增产节约运动放在群众的自觉的基础之上。因此，要求各级领导干部必需亲自动手，积极向群众宣传，并且要充分发挥宣传网的作用，让广大群众正确地理解增产节约的巨大意义。在宣传教育工作中，要善于帮助群众通过种种自我教育的方法，正确地理解个人利益同整体利益、暂时利益同长远利益和民主同集中的关系等，反复说明离开生产的现有水平，片面地强调个人生活改善也是违背人民的集体利益和根本利益的道理。
    会议认为，在加强党的政治工作的同时，必需正确地贯彻执行党在企业中的经济政策。要防止只为节约或赶进度而忽视产品质量和工程质量的片面的生产观点。在执行工资、劳动定额和奖励政策上必需十分慎重。在目前，要通过细致的调查研究工作，慎重地修改那些偏高或偏低的劳动定额，使它坚持在平均的先进的水平上。同时也应该经过调整，使奖励政策既能够促进生产的多和快，更能促进生产的好和省；既能鼓励先进，也能够起促进落后走向先进的作用。
    大会指出，为了充分发挥党组织在增产节约运动中的战斗作用，必需进一步改善党的领导作风，加强基层党组织的领导。各级党组织必需继续反对漠视职工生活福利问题的官僚主义作风，必需研究政策性和思想性的重大问题，克服事务主义作风。加强调查研究工作，加强分析现实情况，以正确地执行上级指示。经过党委研究的重大问题要充分运用党组织的力量贯彻下去，一般要坚持先党内后党外的工作程序。要定期召开党的代表会议和党员代表大会，提高党的民主生活水平。大会强调指出，要加强支部工作的领导和健全党的组织生活，随时开展批评和自我批评，克服不良倾向。在企业中要实行职工代表制度，吸引更广大的群众参加企业管理。
    这次会议是在1月24日至27日举行的。
