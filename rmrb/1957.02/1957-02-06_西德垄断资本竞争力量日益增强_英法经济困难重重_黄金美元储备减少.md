Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: Hamburg dispatch: The tonnage of West German merchant ships is rapidly returning to pre-war levels. According to the West German Shipowners' Association, the total number of West German merchant ships exceeded one thousand as of January 1st this year, with a total tonnage of 3.15 million tons, an increase of 550,000 tons in the past year.

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: In 1956, West Germany's total machine output ranked first among Western European countries, exceeding that of Britain. According to the "New York Times," the total output value of West Germany's machine manufacturing industry last year was approximately $4.16 billion, and the total export value of machines was approximately $1.4 billion, both exceeding Britain.

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: According to TASS, New York, February 4th: "The Christian Science Monitor" recently published a series of articles introducing the penetration of West German capital into Latin America. The articles pointed out that the growth rate of West German investment in Latin America is faster than that of the United States.

From 1952 to 1956, West German capital invested more than $9 million in Brazil. Although U.S. capital still leads in Brazil, the increase in West German investment is faster than at any time in the past.

The volume of trade between West Germany and Latin American countries has also increased significantly. For example, in the first nine months of 1956, the total value of West German goods exported to fourteen Latin American countries increased by $43 million compared with the same period in 1955.

"The Christian Science Monitor" articles concluded that the rapid penetration of West German capital into Latin America has caused concern among American businessmen.

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: London dispatch: British gold and dollar reserves at the end of January were $2.084 billion, $49 million less than at the end of December last year.

According to a British Treasury spokesman, the decrease in reserves was largely due to the purchase of American oil.

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: According to TASS, Paris, February 4th: France's foreign exchange reserves have decreased from 385 billion francs a year ago to 70 billion francs.

    西德垄断资本竞争力量日益增强
    英法经济困难重重　黄金美元储备减少
    新华社5日讯　汉堡消息：西德商船吨位正在迅速恢复到战前水平。据西德船主联合会宣布，今年1月1日的西德商船总数已超过一千艘，总吨位已达到三百十五万吨，去年一年里增加了五十五万吨。
    新华社5日讯　1956年西德的机器总产值已经在西欧各国中占第一位，超过英国的机器总产值。据“纽约时报”报道，去年西德机器制造业总产值约达四十一亿六千万美元，机器出口总值约达十四亿美元，都超过英国。
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日消息：“基督教科学箴言报”最近连载一系列文章，介绍西德资本渗入拉丁美洲的情况。文章指出西德在拉丁美洲投资增长的速度比美国的大。
    从1952年到1956年间，西德资本在巴西投下了九百多万美元。虽然美国资本在巴西仍然领先，但是西德投资的增加比之过去任何时期都要快。
    西德和拉丁美洲国家之间的贸易量也已经大大增加。比如，在1956年头九个月，西德输出到十四个拉丁美洲国家的货物总值就比1955年同期增加了四千三百万美元。
    “基督教科学箴言报”的文章最后指出，西德资本的迅速渗入拉丁美洲已经使美国商人们感到担心。
    据新华社5日讯　伦敦消息：英国黄金美元储备1月底是二十亿八千四百万美元，比去年12月底少了四千九百万美元。
    据英国财政部发言人说，储备的减少很大部分是因为购买美国石油所造成的。
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社巴黎4日讯：法国的外汇准备金已经从一年前的三千八百五十亿法郎减少到七百亿法郎。
