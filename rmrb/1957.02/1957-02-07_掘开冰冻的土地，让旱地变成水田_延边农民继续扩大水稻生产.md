Xinhua News Agency, Yanji: Members of various ethnic groups in many agricultural cooperatives in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture are braving the severe cold, chiseling and blasting rocks, and breaking up frozen soil to develop dry land into paddy fields. This year, the prefecture's paddy field area will be expanded by another 6,770 hectares. In this way, the paddy field area developed in the two years after the prefecture achieved advanced cooperativization will be equivalent to two and a half times the total paddy field area developed in the previous ten years, and rice production will account for more than 50% of the prefecture's total grain output.

After the Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture achieved advanced cooperativization last year, 444 ethnic joint cooperatives voluntarily formed by farmers of Korean, Han, and Manchu ethnicities combined the superior rice cultivation techniques of Korean farmers with the land and relatively ample labor force of Han and Manchu farmers to develop rice production. Last year, the prefecture developed more than 11,000 hectares of paddy fields. Although the Yanbian area suffered severe natural disasters such as waterlogging, wind, floods, and frost last summer, agricultural cooperatives that developed more paddy fields increased their income or maintained their previous year's income level because the income from each hectare of newly cultivated paddy field increased by more than half compared to dry land.

In order to help agricultural cooperatives develop rice production, the autonomous prefecture's finance department has decided this year to prioritize investment in basic water conservancy construction in all basic construction investments. The agricultural department has also proposed two new measures for developing rice production.

Because the main and branch veins of Changbai Mountain and Laosong Ridge run through the prefecture, the Yanbian area has many mountains and little land. The average annual temperature here is only two to four degrees Celsius, and the frost-free period is only four to five months. However, creative Korean farmers have successfully cultivated rice, which is suitable for growth in the southern temperate climate, in the cold regions. Many years of experience have shown that planting rice here yields more and is more profitable than planting dry land crops.

### 掘开冰冻的土地，让旱地变成水田  延边农民继续扩大水稻生产

    掘开冰冻的土地，让旱地变成水田
    延边农民继续扩大水稻生产
    据新华社延吉电　延边朝鲜族自治州许多农业社的各族社员们，正冒着严寒凿炸岩石，掘开冻土，把旱地开发成为稻田。今年自治州的稻田面积将再扩大六千七百七十多公顷。这样，全州实现高级合作化后的两年内所开发的稻田面积将相当于在此以前十年中开发稻田面积总和的两倍半，稻谷产量在全州粮食总产量中将占50％以上。
    去年自治州实现了高级合作化以后，由朝鲜、汉、满等民族的农民自愿组成的四百四十四个民族联合社，把朝鲜族农民栽培水稻的优越技术和汉族、满族农民的土地、较充分的劳动力等条件结合起来，发展了水稻生产。去年全州共开发一万一千多公顷稻田。去年夏天，延边地区虽然遭到了水、风、涝、霜等严重的自然灾害，但由于每公顷新开稻田的收益比旱地的收益增加一半以上，开发稻田较多的农业社都比前年增加了收入或保持了前年的收入水平。
    为了帮助各农业社发展水稻生产，自治州财政部门今年决定把水利基本建设投资列为各项基本建设投资的首位。农业部门也提出了发展水稻的两项新措施。
    由于长白山和老松岭主、支脉纵贯全州，延边地区山多地少。这里的常年平均气温只有摄氏二到四度，无霜期只有四、五个月。但富有创造精神的朝鲜族农民，把适宜在南方温带气候生长的水稻成功地培植在寒冷地带。多年的经验表明，在这里种植水稻比种植旱地作物产量高、收益大。
