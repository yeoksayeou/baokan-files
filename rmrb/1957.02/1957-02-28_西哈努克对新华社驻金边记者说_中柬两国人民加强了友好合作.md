Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 27th: Prince Sihanouk answered some questions raised by a Xinhua News Agency reporter on February 25th. These questions were posed to him by the Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Phnom Penh on the occasion of the first anniversary (February 18th) of the signing of the Cambodia-China Joint Statement.

Prince Sihanouk first expressed his delight that the Cambodia-China Joint Statement had effectively strengthened the ties between the peoples of the two countries. He said that the two countries had exchanged delegations and permanent economic delegations. The economic aid agreement between the two countries has begun to be implemented. He also said that Mr. Zhou Enlai's week-long visit to Cambodia strengthened the friendly relations and comprehensive cooperation between the Cambodian and Chinese peoples.

Sihanouk then spoke about the achievements of Cambodia's policy of neutrality. He said that all the assistance given by Eastern and Western countries has enabled Cambodia to improve roads, ports, sanitation facilities, culture and other undertakings. Sihanouk also talked about the role of Chinese assistance to Cambodia in construction.

In the political aspect, Sihanouk said that Cambodia's neutrality has enabled it to gain new friends while maintaining the friendship of old friends. For this reason, Cambodia's international standing and its security have been greatly strengthened.

Sihanouk also believes that Cambodia's desire to cooperate peacefully with all countries that respect Cambodia's independence and sovereignty has had a gratifying impact on maintaining peace in Asia and other parts of the world.

Sihanouk said: "Many other small and medium-sized countries believe that our neutrality is an experiment. If we can continue to be neutral while maintaining complete independence, and if the major powers avoid constantly taking a critical attitude towards our good intentions, our position is likely to be increasingly sympathized with externally. We believe that this can only be beneficial to peace."

Sihanouk continued: "In fact, we strive to be a factor of stability and order - albeit on a very limited scale - on our continent, which is divided by hostile emotions and ideas."

Sihanouk concluded: "Our policy of neutrality seems to have been accepted by everyone, whether they like it or not. After experiencing periods of friction, sometimes difficult, we still maintain good relations with all countries. As long as we maintain true neutrality without deviation, people will have no excuse to criticize or attack us, and we will strive to maintain everyone's respect for us."

    西哈努克对新华社驻金边记者说
    中柬两国人民加强了友好合作
    新华社金边27日电　西哈努克亲王在2月25日答复了新华社记者向他提出的一些问题。这些问题是新华社驻金边记者在柬埔寨、中国联合声明签订一周年（2月18日）时向他提出的。
    西哈努克亲王首先表示对柬埔寨、中国联合声明已经有效地加强了两国人民之间的联系感到庆幸。他说，两国已经互派了代表团和常驻经济代表团。两国之间的经济援助协定已经开始执行。他又说，周恩来先生在柬埔寨历时整整一周的访问，加强了柬埔寨人民和中国人民的友好关系和全面合作。
    西哈努克接着谈到柬埔寨奉行中立政策所获得的成就。他说，东方国家和西方国家所给予的一切援助，使柬埔寨得以改善公路、港口、卫生设施、文化等事业。西哈努克还谈到中国给柬埔寨的帮助对柬埔寨建设上的作用。
    在政治方面，西哈努克说，柬埔寨的中立使它得到新的朋友，同时保持了老朋友的友谊。由于这个缘故，柬埔寨的国际地位和它的安全，都大大地加强了。
    西哈努克同时认为：柬埔寨所竭力表示的要同一切尊重柬埔寨的独立和主权的国家和平合作的愿望，对于维护亚洲和世界其他地区的和平，已经产生了令人庆幸的影响。
    西哈努克说：“许多其他中小国家的人民认为我们的中立是一种试验。如果我们能够在保持完全独立的情况下继续中立，如果大国避免经常对我们的良好意愿采取挑剔态度，我们的立场就有可能日益受到外部的同情。我们认为：这只能是对和平有益的。”
    西哈努克接着说：“事实上我们 力求在被敌对的情绪和思想所分裂的我们的大陆上——当然是在很有限的规模上——成为一个稳定和秩序的因素。”
    西哈努克最后说：“我们的中立政策似乎已经为大家所接受，不管是否愿意。在经历了有时是困难的磨擦时期之后，我们同一切国家仍然保持着良好的关系。只要我们没有偏差地保持真正的中立，人们就没有借口来批评、攻击我们，而且我们将力求保持大家对于我们的尊重。”
