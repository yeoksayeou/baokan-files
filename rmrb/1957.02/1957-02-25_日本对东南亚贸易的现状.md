The output of Japanese goods to Southeast Asian countries has increased significantly in recent years, becoming an important aspect of Japan's export trade. Taking the trade volume of the first three quarters of 1956 as an example, it increased by more than 10% compared to 1955, and by 62% compared to 1953. Currently, with the exception of West Germany, the exports of major capitalist countries to Southeast Asia are almost at a standstill. Therefore, the increase in Japan's exports to Southeast Asia is an unusual occurrence.

However, Japan's exports to the Southeast Asian region are not particularly booming in Japan's overall export trade. If we take 1951 as 100, Japan's total exports increased to 174.7% by 1956, while exports to Southeast Asia only increased to 113.7%. The increase in exports to Southeast Asia has not kept pace with the overall increase in exports.

This situation has arisen because, with the exception of Burma, India, and Pakistan, Japan's exports to Southeast Asian countries have reached their peak. As everyone knows, Japan's export trade has not yet reached the pre-war average level of 1934-1936 due to the decrease in exports to China, Korea, and other places. However, looking at the export volume in 1955 and 1956, exports to Malaya-Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand, and other places have increased to two to eight times the pre-war level. Exports to Ceylon and Indonesia, although not as good as the above-mentioned countries, also greatly exceed the pre-war level. With the exception of Hong Kong, Japan's exports to these places had already greatly exceeded the pre-war level in 1951, and there was almost no increase from then until 1955. In 1951, Japan's exports to Southeast Asia accounted for 40.3% of total exports, far exceeding the pre-war proportion of 18%. However, it has declined year by year since 1952, dropping from 36.2% in 1952 to 26.3% in 1956.

Compared with the pre-war period, Southeast Asian countries are the countries with the least prosperous foreign trade. The trade structure of these countries has not changed much compared to the pre-war period. The import of consumer goods, mainly textiles, still accounts for the vast majority after the war. And textiles are Japan's trump card in international trade competition, and Japan has increased its exports to Southeast Asia by increasing its exports of textiles. With the exception of the Philippines, these countries' trade with Japan is roughly the same as before the war, or even exceeds the pre-war level.

However, the situation in India, Burma, and Pakistan is different. The trade structure of these three countries has undergone significant changes after the war. The focus of their imports has shifted to means of production after the war, while it was consumer goods before the war. As far as textiles are concerned, India has developed its textile industry and has become a major exporter of textiles, which can not only meet the needs of its own country, but also supply the needs of countries such as Burma. Pakistan's self-sufficiency in textiles has also been considerably improved. Japan's reliance on the export of consumer goods, mainly textiles, is not very effective in these countries. Japan's exports to these countries are far from the pre-war level, only 56% of the pre-war level in 1955, and will be less than 50% in 1956. The proportion of India, Burma, and Pakistan in Japan's exports to Southeast Asia has also decreased from 42.4% before the war to 23.9%.

Not only is India working hard to implement industrial construction, but other Southeast Asian countries will inevitably control the import of consumer goods in the future in order to develop industry, and will move towards the direction of importing production equipment. If Japan wants to increase its exports to Southeast Asia in the future, it must focus on heavy industrial products.

In recent years, looking at Japan's overall exports, Southeast Asia has been Japan's most important market for heavy industrial products. Because for European and American capitalist countries, Japan can only focus on exporting food, groceries, and the like. And Japan's relatively slow-developing heavy industry must find markets in Southeast Asia and other countries where industry is not developed. Therefore, in Japan's export trade in 1955, 37% of steel ingots and bars, 42% of thick steel plates, 65% of galvanized iron sheets, and 69% of steel rails were exported to Southeast Asia. Also, 44% of machines other than ships, especially most of the engines, textile machines, and various vehicles, were exported to Southeast Asia.

However, Japan's exports of chemical industrial products to Southeast Asia today are still very small. Contrary to textiles, Japan's chemical industrial products, metals, machinery, and other production equipment are at an absolute disadvantage and cannot withstand the competition from Europe and the United States. According to a survey by the Japan Machinery Industry Federation, the prices of Japanese-made machines are more expensive than those of competing countries, with power generation equipment being about 25% more expensive and factory equipment being 30%-60% more expensive. In terms of payment terms, Japan's proposed payment period is generally five to seven years, with a minimum annual interest rate of 4%, while the payment period proposed by competing countries is sometimes more than ten years, with an annual interest rate of 3.5%. Even the prices of fertilizers and other chemical industrial products and cement are very different. Only when maritime freight rates rise very high can Japan withstand the competition from European and American goods.

Other aspects are also not optimistic. The international balance of payments of Southeast Asian countries, which mainly export agricultural products, has been deteriorating for several years, and the situation is serious. Most of these countries rely on foreign aid and loans to maintain a roughly balanced international balance of payments. For example, although Japan's exports to Indonesia have increased, they will not only not increase but will also decrease in the long run due to the latter's lack of foreign exchange.

In short, Japan's trade with Southeast Asia is at a difficult stage. In order to break this situation, Japan sent many trade delegations to various parts of Southeast Asia last year, but most of them did not yield any results. The survey results of the Japanese machinery industry delegation to India are an example. Most of the solutions they proposed were ineffective. For example, they proposed that Japan increase the import of agricultural products from Southeast Asian countries to increase the other party's purchasing power for Japanese goods. However, Japan's agricultural production has had bumper harvests for two consecutive years and has gradually developed somewhat. In addition, the inflow of surplus agricultural products from the United States has reduced the quantity of agricultural imports. This method is not very reliable. If imports of industrial raw materials other than agricultural products are increased, the targets can only be limited to India, Malaya, the Philippines, and other countries, and the scope is too narrow. Furthermore, relying on capital exports and providing credit to increase trade with Southeast Asia will not have much results. Because fundamentally speaking, Japan's capital export strength is insufficient. As far as individual industrial capitalists are concerned, they are more enthusiastic about investing to ensure raw materials, like steel capitalists, but have not yet entered the stage of large-scale investment in other forms. Therefore, these methods are not very feasible.

Former Hatoyama cabinet finance minister Ichimanda proposed a solution at the 11th World Bank Annual Meeting held in September last year. That is, he wanted to use a portion of the yen funds invested by the World Bank to lend to Southeast Asian countries as funds for importing Japanese goods. Although Ichimanda's plan did not cause a special reaction in Japan, it shows that Japan's ruling class is trying to adopt a US-reliant approach in order to break the current deadlock, which will also bring adverse consequences to Japan's trade in Southeast Asia.

    日本对东南亚贸易的现状
    蓝海
    日本对东南亚国家的输出，近年来有比较显著的增加，成为目前日本出口贸易中一个重要方面。以1956年前三个季度的贸易额来说，就比1955年增加了10％强，比1953年增加了62％。目前除西德以外，各主要资本主义国家对东南亚的输出几乎陷于停顿状态。因此，日本对东南亚出口的增加，是个不寻常的事情。
    然而，日本对东南亚地区的输出，在日本的整个出口贸易中并不是十分景气的。如以1951年为一百，日本出口总额到1956年增加为174.7％，而对东南亚的出口额只增为113.7％。对东南亚的输出的增加，赶不上全部输出增加的速度。
    这个情况的产生，是因为除缅甸、印度、巴基斯坦以外，日本对东南亚国家的输出已经增加到顶点了。正如大家所知道的，日本的出口贸易由于对中国、朝鲜等地输出的减少，还未能达到战前1934年—1936年的平均水平。但从1955年、1956年两年出口额来看，对马来亚新嘉坡、香港、菲律宾、泰国等地的输出，已增加到战前的二倍至八倍。对锡兰、印度尼西亚的输出，虽然比上述各国差，也大大超过战前水平。除香港以外，日本对这些地方的输出在1951年就已大大超过了战前水平，其后到1955年为止几乎没有增加。1951年，日本对东南亚的输出在总出口额中占40.3％，远远超过战前18％的比重。但是，从1952年以后逐年下降，到1956年已从1952年的36.2％降到26.3％。
    同战前相比，东南亚各国是对外贸易最不景气的国家。这些国家的贸易构成比起战前没有什么变化。以纺织品为中心的消费资料的进口，在战后仍然占绝大数量。而纺织品是日本在国际贸易竞争中的一张王牌，日本是增加纺织品的出口而增加了对东南亚的输出。除菲律宾外，这些国家对日本的贸易大体同战前相仿，甚至超过战前水平。
    但是，在印度、缅甸、巴基斯坦三国的情况不同。三国的贸易构成，在战后有了显著的变化。它们进口商品的重点在战后转为生产资料，而战前是以消费资料为重点的。就纺织品来说，印度由于发展了纺织工业，已成为纺织品的一大输出国，它的纺织业不仅能满足本国的需要，而且能供应缅甸等国的需要。巴基斯坦的纺织品自给程度也有相当的提高。日本一向仰赖的以纺织品为中心的消费资料输出，在这些国家很不得势。日本对这些国家的输出，距离战前水平很远，1955年仅为战前的56％，而1956年将在50％以下。在日本对东南亚的输出中，印度、缅甸和巴基斯坦三国所占的比重也从战前的42.4％减到23.9％。
    不仅印度在努力实行工业建设，就是其它东南亚国家为了发展工业，今后也必然会控制消费资料的进口，而朝着进口生产设备的方向发展。今后日本要增加对东南亚的输出，必须在重工业制品上打主意。
    几年来，从日本的整个输出来看，东南亚是日本重工业制品的最重要市场。因为对于欧美各资本主义国家，日本只能以食品、杂品等为输出的中心。而发展较迟缓的日本重工业必须到东南亚等地工业不发展的国家去找市场。所以，1955年日本的出口贸易中37％的钢锭、条钢，42％的厚钢板，65％的镀锌铁板，69％的钢轨等都是向东南亚输出的。还有除船舶以外的44％的机器，特别是发动机、纺织机、各种车辆的绝大部分都是向东南亚输出的。
    但是，日本今天向东南亚输出的化学工业制品还少得很。同纺织品相反，日本的化学工业制品、金属、机器等生产设备却占绝对劣势，抵不住欧美的竞争。据日本机器工业联合会调查，日本出产的机器价格比竞争国贵，发电设备约贵25％，工厂设备贵30％—60％。在支付条件方面，日本提的支付期限一般是五年到七年，年利最低是四分，而竞争国提的支付期限有的在十年以上，年利是三分五厘。就是肥料等化学工业制品以及水泥等的价格也相差很多，只是在海上运费涨得非常高的时候，日本才能抵得住欧美商品的竞争。
    其它方面也并不乐观。以输出农产品为主的东南亚国家，国际收支几年来一直恶化，情况严重。这些国家多半靠外援借款等来保持国际收支的大体平衡。比如，日本对印度尼西亚的输出虽然有所增加，但因后者外汇不足，长此下去就不仅不能增加，还会减少。
    总之，日本对东南亚的贸易正处在困难的阶段。为了打开这种局面，去年日本曾派出好多贸易代表团到东南亚各地去访问，但大多数都没有什么结果。日本机械工业访印代表团的调查结果，就是一个例子。在他们提出的几种办法中，大部分都没有什么成效。例如，他们提出要日本用增加输入东南亚各国农产品的办法，来提高对方对日本商品的购买力。但是，日本农业生产近两年来连续丰收，已逐渐有了些发展，再加上美国剩余农产品的流入，农产品进口的数量已在减少。这个办法不太可靠。如以增加农产品以外的工业原料的进口，对象只能限于印度、马来亚、菲律宾等国，范围太狭。再如靠资本输出和提供信贷的办法来增加对东南亚的贸易，也不会有多大结果。因为从根本上讲，日本的资本输出力量不足，就个别的产业资本家来说，像钢铁资本家那样为确保原料而投资还比较热心，但还没有进入以其它形式大规模进行投资的阶段。所以这些办法，都不大行得通。
    前鸠山内阁一万田藏相在去年9月间举行第十一届世界银行年会上提出了一个办法。这就是想利用世界银行投的一部分日圆资金贷给东南亚国家，作为输入日本商品的资金。一万田的这个计划在日本国内虽然没有引起特别的反响，却说明日本的统治阶层为了打开目前的僵局而企图采取依靠美国的作法，这对日本在东南亚贸易也会带来不良的后果。
