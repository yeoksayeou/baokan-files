    The recent Sixth Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the USSR, which concluded on the 12th, discussed and adopted the Law on the National Economic Plan and the State Budget of the USSR for 1957, the decree on expanding the powers of the Union Republics, and discussed and adopted the resolution of the Supreme Soviet unanimously agreeing with the foreign policy of the Soviet government. These laws and resolutions reflect the great efforts of the Soviet Union in carrying out communist construction and the peaceful aspirations of the Soviet people, and will play an important role in the Soviet people's struggle to implement the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    The basic task of socialist countries is to vigorously develop socialist production and, on the basis of production development, continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. The USSR's national economic plan and state budget for 1957 fully conform to this basic task. In 1956, the first year of the USSR's Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people achieved great successes in all aspects of economic work: industrial output increased by nearly 11% compared with 1955, agriculture achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and the Party and the government implemented a series of important measures to improve the people's lives. On the basis of these great achievements, the USSR's national economic plan for 1957 focuses primarily on increasing the materials and raw materials necessary for completing production and construction plans, further developing agriculture, increasing national consumer goods, greatly improving housing construction, and further raising the people's material and cultural living standards. This year, the Soviet Union's state budget allocates over 240 billion rubles to the national economy. When allocating investments to various sectors of the national economy, the government continues to guarantee the priority development of heavy industry, especially the raw materials industry, while also greatly increasing investments to further improve the people's material and cultural living standards. For example, the residential area built this year using state investment and residents' funds will increase by more than a quarter compared to last year. The USSR's state budget for 1957 once again embodies the peaceful nature of the socialist state budget and the purpose of developing the economy and improving the people's lives. This year, the main part of the USSR's state budget expenditure is used to develop production and meet the material and cultural needs of the people. On the income side of the budget, the income from taxes and public debt has been reduced in order to reduce people's expenditures and make their lives more prosperous. The state budget also increased the budgets of the Union Republics, which will further promote the economic prosperity of the Union Republics. It is particularly worth mentioning that this year the defense expenditure in the Soviet Union's state budget has been reduced again, accounting for only 16% of the total budget expenditure (compared to 18% last year), while the draft US budget for this year stipulates that military expenditure accounts for 63% of the total state budget. From this, we can clearly see the benefits that disarmament measures bring to the people, and also prove that the Soviet Union is resolutely pursuing a policy of safeguarding peace and is taking practical actions to strive for the relaxation of the international situation.

    In recent years, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have taken many important measures to enhance the role of the Union Republics. The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee's summary report passed by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the task of further expanding the powers of the Union Republics in economic construction and cultural construction. The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee last December also proposed to enhance the role of the Union Republics in economic leadership. At this session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, some decrees were passed to expand the powers of the Union Republics: stipulating that the legislative power of the law on the organization of the courts of the Union Republics and the civil law, criminal law, and procedural law should be handed over to the Union Republics, and that the power to establish states and border regions in the Union Republics should be handed over to the Union Republics. These measures are fully in line with the Leninist principles of nationality. This will further give play to the independence and initiative of the Union Republics, further promote the economic and cultural development of the Union Republics, and at the same time further strengthen the fraternal friendship and unity between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    Starting from the domestic policy of peaceful construction in the Soviet Union, the Soviet government has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy of friendly cooperation with all countries in order to strive for a peaceful international environment for carrying out communist construction. This is fully reflected in the resolution passed by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR unanimously agreeing with the report by Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov on "The International Situation and the Foreign Policy of the Soviet Union."

    In his report, Comrade Shepilov made a profound analysis of the current international situation. As he pointed out: Under the current balance of power on the international stage, the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is the only realistic policy. However, some imperialist groups are unwilling to realistically accept the proposition of peaceful coexistence and still attempt to solve international problems by force. Recently, the friendship and unity of the socialist camp has been greatly strengthened, but the contradictions between imperialists have become more acute. The current imperialist strategy is to try to weaken or "offset" the contradictions within their own camp by stepping up the implementation of aggressive and adventurous policies against the socialist camp. However, as Comrade Shepilov also pointed out, the international forces of peace far outweigh the forces of imperialist aggression, and as long as all the forces that can be united internationally are united, any conspiracy of imperialism can be smashed.

    In his report, Comrade Shepilov talked about the fact that the Soviet Union, in the spirit of safeguarding and consolidating peace, will continue to strive for peace, friendship and international cooperation, and will first continue to strive for the solution of the two important tasks of disarmament and guaranteeing collective security in Europe and Asia. Comrade Shepilov particularly emphasized the urgency of ensuring the security of the Middle East region. As everyone knows, although the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt has been stopped, the tension in this region has not been truly eliminated. Because the United States is pursuing the "Eisenhower Doctrine" colonial aggression plan aimed at squeezing out Britain and France and enslaving the people of the Middle East, the sovereignty and independence of the Middle Eastern countries and the peace and security of this region are once again seriously threatened. To this end, on the 11th, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, proposing to jointly formulate and announce the basic principles of the declaration of the four governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the peace and security of the Middle East and non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries in this region: to maintain peace in the Middle East through negotiations and peaceful settlement of disputes, not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Middle Eastern countries, not to attempt to drag these countries into military blocs, to withdraw foreign bases and foreign troops on Middle Eastern territory, to jointly refuse to supply arms to Middle Eastern countries, and to promote the economic development of Middle Eastern countries without political and military conditions. There is no doubt that if these basic principles can be implemented in the Middle East region, the peace and security of this region can be guaranteed, and the independence and freedom of the countries in this region can be guaranteed. Therefore, this proposal of the Soviet government will surely be supported by all peace-loving countries and people.

    Friendly cooperation with all countries is the firm and unwavering policy of the Soviet government. Comrade Shepilov not only pointed out the importance of improving relations between the major powers of the world and the great possibility of easing international tensions, but also emphasized that the Soviet Union will continue to strengthen and develop friendly cooperation with nationally independent countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Soviet Union's efforts in this regard will make new contributions to maintaining international peace and easing international tensions.

    In the short seven days of the meeting, the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have done important and beneficial work for the Soviet people and all peace-loving people. The Chinese people are excited for the new achievements that the Soviet people will achieve in communist construction, and are delighted for the greater victory that the Soviet peaceful foreign policy will achieve.

### 苏联最高苏维埃会议的成就

    苏联最高苏维埃会议的成就
    最近举行的苏联第四届最高苏维埃第六次会议已于12日闭幕。这次会议讨论和通过了苏联1957年的国民经济计划法和国家预算法、扩大加盟共和国职权的法令，并讨论和通过了最高苏维埃一致同意苏联政府的外交政策的决议。这些法令和决议反映了苏联进行共产主义建设的巨大努力和苏联人民的和平愿望，并将在苏联人民为实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议的斗争中起重要的作用。
    社会主义国家的基本任务是大力发展社会主义生产，并在生产发展的基础上不断提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。1957年苏联的国民经济计划和国家预算完全符合这个基本任务。1956年，苏联第六个五年计划的第一年，苏联人民在经济工作的各方面都获得了巨大的成就：工业产量比1955年增加将近11％，农业获得了空前的大丰收，党和政府实行了一系列的改善人民生活的重要措施。在这种巨大成就的基础上，1957年苏联国民经济计划，把主要的注意力放在增加燃料、金属等为完成生产建设计划所必需的材料和原料方面，放在进一步发展农业、增加国民消费品以及大大改善住宅建筑工作和进一步提高人民的物质和文化生活水平方面。今年苏联国家预算中用于国民经济方面的拨款达二千四百多亿卢布。政府在分配国民经济各部门投资时，仍然是保证重工业、首先是原料工业的优先发展，同时也大大增加进一步提高人民物质和文化生活水平方面的投资，例如今年使用国家投资和居民资金建筑的住宅面积将比去年增加四分之一以上。1957年苏联的国家预算，再一次体现了社会主义国家预算的和平性质和发展经济、改善人民生活的目的。今年苏联国家预算的支出方面，主要部分是用在发展生产、满足人民物质和文化的需要上。在预算的收入方面，减少了赋税和公债的收入，以便减轻人民支出，使人民的生活更加富裕。国家预算中还增加了加盟共和国的预算，这将进一步促进加盟共和国经济的繁荣。特别值得提出的是，今年苏联国家预算中的国防费用再一次降低，只占预算全部开支的16％（去年是18％），而今年度美国预算草案规定军事支出占全部国家预算的63％。从这里可以明显地看出实行裁军措施给人民带来的好处，同时也证明了苏联是坚决实行维护和平的政策，并且以实际行动来争取国际局势的缓和。
    近几年来，苏联共产党和苏联政府采取了许多重要措施来提高各加盟共和国的作用。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会通过的苏共中央总结报告的决议中，提出了进一步扩大各加盟共和国在经济建设和文化建设方面的权力的任务。去年12月苏共中央全会也提出了要提高各加盟共和国在经济领导中的作用。在这次苏联最高苏维埃会议上，又通过了一些扩大加盟共和国职权的法令：规定把加盟共和国法院组织法和民法、刑法、诉讼法的立法权交给加盟共和国，把加盟共和国设立州和边疆区的职权交给加盟共和国。这些措施是完全符合于列宁主义的民族原则的。这将进一步发挥各加盟共和国的独立性和主动性，进一步促进各加盟共和国的经济和文化的发展，同时也将进一步加强苏联各族人民之间的兄弟友谊和团结。
    从苏联的和平建设的国内政策出发，苏联政府一贯执行着同各国友好合作的和平外交政策，以便争取一个和平的国际环境来从事共产主义建设。这一点充分表现在苏联最高苏维埃会议通过的一致同意苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫关于“国际局势和苏联外交政策问题”的报告的决议中。
    谢皮洛夫同志在报告中对目前国际局势作了深刻的分析。正像他所指出的：在目前国际舞台的力量对比下，不同社会制度国家的和平共处的政策是唯一实事求是的政策。然而某些帝国主义集团却不愿实事求是地接受和平共处的主张，仍然企图用强力的方法来解决国际问题。最近以来，社会主义阵营的友谊和团结是大大加强了，帝国主义之间的矛盾却更加尖锐了。目前帝国主义的战略是想靠加紧实行对社会主义阵营进行侵略和冒险政策来减弱或“抵消”自己阵营的矛盾。然而，也正如谢皮洛夫同志所指出的，国际和平力量远远超过了帝国主义侵略集团的力量，只要把国际上一切可以团结的力量团结起来，就可以击破帝国主义的任何阴谋。
    谢皮洛夫同志在报告中谈到了苏联本着维护和巩固和平的精神，将为争取和平、友谊和国际合作而继续努力，首先将继续努力来寻求裁军和保证欧洲和亚洲的集体安全两项重要任务的解决。谢皮洛夫同志特别强调了目前保障中近东地区安全的迫切性。大家知道，英、法、以侵略埃及的行动虽然已被制止了，然而，这一地区的紧张局势并未真正消除。由于美国推行以排挤英法、奴役中近东人民为目的的“艾森豪威尔主义”的殖民侵略计划，使中近东各国的主权和独立以及这个地区的和平和安全，又受到严重的威胁。为此，苏联政府11日照会美、英、法三国政府，建议共同拟订和宣布苏、美、英、法四国政府关于中近东和平和安全以及不干涉这个地区国家内政问题的宣言的基本原则：以谈判和和平解决争端的方式来维护中近东的和平，不干涉中近东国家的内政，不企图把这些国家拖入军事集团，撤消中近东领土上的外国基地和撤退外国军队，共同拒绝把武器供给中近东国家，促进中近东国家经济发展而不附政治和军事条件。毫无疑问，如果这些基本原则能在中近东地区实施，就能保障这一地区的和平和安全，就能保障这一地区各国的独立和自由。因此，苏联政府的这一建议必将得到一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。
    同一切国家友好合作是苏联政府的坚定不移的政策。谢皮洛夫同志不仅指出改善世界各大国之间关系的重要性和缓和国际紧张局势的巨大可能性，并且着重表明苏联将根据和平共处五项原则同民族独立国家继续加强和发展友好合作关系。苏联在这方面的努力将对维护国际和平和缓和国际紧张局势作出新的贡献。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表们在短短七天会议中，已为苏联人民和一切爱好和平的人民做了重要的有益的工作。中国人民为苏联人民将在共产主义建设中获得新的成就而兴奋，为苏联和平外交政策将获得更大的胜利而欢欣。
