In recent years, tens of thousands of people from other places have come to Lanzhou to participate in the construction here. As the annual Spring Festival approaches, relatives across the country are concerned about the work and living conditions of their children, and whether they have made progress after coming to Lanzhou. The reporters will answer some of the questions people are concerned about below.

        Good News Every Month
Since its establishment, the Waterproof Mixing Work Team of Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant has exceeded its construction tasks every month. In January, it completed its task three days ahead of schedule. Team leader Lu Kemu told reporters that their task was completed well, mainly because of the team's unity and reliance on everyone to find solutions.

The team members come from Northeast China, Shanghai, and Shandong. When it was established last April, people were not used to the lifestyle, were not united, and had low production efficiency. Later, everyone fully discussed production and living problems, and formulated methods of mutual care, mutual assistance, and improved production efficiency. As a result, everyone exceeded their quotas. Once, they were assigned the task of brushing oil felt. If they brushed by hand, one person could only brush two bundles a day. Seeing that the task could not be completed, team leader Lu Kemu and the team members spent more than ten days and nights researching and finally created an oil felt brushing machine. As a result, work efficiency increased eleven times, saving more than 3,700 man-days.

        Nineteen-Year-Old High-Voltage Welding Girl
Nineteen-year-old Chongqing girl Xiao Sufang is working hard on high-temperature and high-pressure welding on the boiler of the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant these days. On the morning of January 28, the reporter went to the boiler to find her. The ladder was suspended high in the air, and climbing up made one dizzy. After finding her, she was sitting on a suspended wooden board, holding a mask in one hand and a pair of pliers in the other, concentrating on welding the steel frame of the boiler. The "squeak—squeak" sound and the sparks that were emitted surrounded her. The reporter couldn't help but admire her courage, meticulousness, and high skills.

Xiao Sufang only came to the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant construction site last September. At that time, she was still an apprentice, but in just a few months, she became a fifth-grade technician and a well-known advanced producer on the construction site.

In the past few months, more than 200 high-temperature and high-pressure welds she welded have met quality standards after inspection, penetration testing, and experiments. She said that in 1957, she would use her own hands to make Lanzhou more beautiful.

        Fate Brings People Together From Afar
A lively wedding began, and guests filled the cafeteria of the Lanzhou Refinery construction site. A newlywed couple, dressed in beautiful clothes, sat in front with smiling faces, and people kept applauding and asking them to report their love story.

The groom's name is Yu Fengge. He came here from Harbin last January and is now a technician at the Lanzhou Refinery construction site. He joined the Communist Party of China last September. He has put forward many rationalization proposals in his work, one of which saved the country more than 10,000 yuan after implementation. Because of his serious and responsible work, he has been rated as an advanced producer every season. The bride, Zhu Chuanluan, is a member of the Youth League and is from Nanjing. She works actively and is praised by people. When they got married on January 28, they also made plans for how to live after marriage and how to march towards science this year.

        Old Professor Praised Throughout the Country
Professor Zhu Ziqing of the Chemistry Department of Lanzhou University, who was valued by international scientists at the Plant Alkaloid Conference in the German Democratic Republic not long ago, recently won the first scientific award in our country awarded by the Academy of Sciences for his outstanding achievements in the research of chemical structure of fritillary alkaloids. Professor Zhu Ziqing came from Fudan University in Shanghai in 1955 to support Lanzhou University. The reporter recently met him when he was going to the library to find information. He said that he always works late into the night these days and is rushing to write a summary paper on the study of fritillary alkaloids, which will be published in the upcoming Lanzhou University Journal. This year, he will also conduct research on fritillary enzymes and medicinal materials such as Gansu Minbei and Angelica with young lecturer Huang Wenkui, teaching assistant Ni Yinhao, etc., and strive to achieve new achievements this year.

Old Mr. Zhu has been engaged in scientific research and teaching for more than 20 years. After coming to Lanzhou, he overcame various difficulties encountered in living and scientific research conditions, and achieved success in his work. Last year, he was selected by Gansu Province as a representative of the educational circle to attend the National Conference of Advanced Producers. In order to work in the Northwest for a long time, he moved his mother, who is nearly eighty years old, as well as his wife and four children to Lanzhou.

        They Beautified Lanzhou Women
People who visited Lanzhou more than a year ago knew that Lanzhou women loved to be beautiful, but lacked experienced hairdressers and seamstresses, and the hairstyles and clothing styles of women were very monotonous.

Since a large number of barber shops and clothing stores from Shanghai moved to Lanzhou, the women of Lanzhou have changed. Their clothes are both economical and beautiful, and their hairstyles are also varied.

The reporter interviewed Bu Wanyao, a hairdresser from the International Barber Shop who moved from Shanghai. This young hairdresser's skills were still very poor more than a year ago. In order to dress women beautifully, he often wrote letters to famous technicians in Shanghai for advice, went to dances to observe women's hairstyles, and constantly solicited customers' opinions on haircuts. After painstakingly figuring out a hairstyle, he would always try it out in the store before recommending it to customers. Because his haircuts are based on the preferences of women in different regions, the size, thinness, and fatness of their faces, adapting to local conditions and changing according to the person, everyone is satisfied with the haircuts.

        New Flowers in Lanzhou's Art Scene
The actors of the Lanzhou Yue Opera Troupe—formerly the Shanghai Chunguang Yue Opera Troupe—are busy rehearsing the new play "Double Pearl Phoenix" before the Spring Festival. The male lead, Wen Biyou, is played by troupe leader Yin Shuchun, and the female lead, Huo Jindin, is played by deputy troupe leader Li Huiqin.

Since the Lanzhou Yue Opera Troupe moved to Lanzhou last August, it has performed excellent traditional Yue Opera programs such as "West Chamber Record," "Second Plum Blossom," "Lychee Exchange for Red Peach," and "White Jade Biography." The audience has exceeded 100,000, and almost every performance is packed. Northerners who did not like to watch Yue Opera now have a keen interest in it. Yin Shuchun, the head of the Yue Opera Troupe, Li Huiqin, the deputy head, and Tian Zhenfang have also recently been elected as representatives to the People's Congress or hired as members of the CPPCC by people of all ethnic groups in Gansu Province and Lanzhou City.

        Determined to Live in Lanzhou
The staff of the No. 39 Pork Outlet of the Lanzhou Food Company wrote a letter of determination to their superiors before the Spring Festival, guaranteeing that they would work in Lanzhou with peace of mind and do a good job in supplying meat for the Spring Festival. There is a story before the staff of this outlet wrote the letter of determination: originally, when they came to Lanzhou a few months ago, they were still carrying their business licenses from Shanghai. They thought: if Lanzhou is not a good place to stay, they can still hang up their signs and do business after returning to Shanghai with their business licenses.

After they arrived in Lanzhou, the place where they lived was relatively remote, and life was a little harder than in Shanghai. Five out of six people were not at ease with their work.

When the reporter asked them why they wrote the letter of determination this time, they said: they only knew that Lanzhou was harder than Shanghai, but they did not know that the objects of their outlet's supply were precisely the workers of many large industrial constructions. How could they see such large industries in Shanghai? It turned out that the large industrial construction in Lanzhou inspired them. Later, they saw that workers sometimes came out to buy meat, which affected their work, so they delivered meat to the construction site to sell. In order to improve the work of selling meat, they also put forward thirteen rationalization proposals in the past month.

    春节访支援兰州建设的人们	新华社记者　王体强　孙晶　黄静
    近年来，有成千上万的人从外地来到兰州参加这里的建设事业。在这一年一度的春节到来的时候，分布在全国各地的亲人们都在关心自己子弟的工作和生活情况，他们来到兰州后有没有进步。记者就在下面回答一些人们所关心的问题。
        月月传喜讯
    自成立以来月月超额完成施工任务的兰州热电站防水混合工作队，1月份又提前三天完成了任务。队长路克木对记者说，他们任务完成得好，主要是因为队内团结，依靠大家想办法。
    这个队的人员都是从东北、上海和山东来的。去年4月成立时，人们在生活上都不习惯，互相不团结、生产效率低。后来大家对生产和生活上的问题进行了充分讨论，订出了互相关心、互相帮助和提高生产效率的办法，结果每个人都突破了定额。有一次，他们担任刷油毛毡的工作，如果用手工刷，一人一天只能刷两捆。眼看不能完成任务，队长路克木和队员们经过十多个白天黑夜的研究，终于创造出一台刷油毛毡机，结果工作效率提高十一倍，还节省了三千七百多个人工。
    十九岁的高压电焊姑娘
    十九岁的重庆姑娘肖素芳，这几天正紧张地在兰州热电站锅炉上进行高温高压的电焊工作。1月28日早晨，记者到锅炉上去找她，梯子悬在高空，一爬上去就头晕眼花。找到她以后，她正坐在一条悬空的木板上，一手拿着面罩，一手握着把钳，聚精会神地焊接锅炉的钢架，“吱——吱”的响声和喷出来的火星包围了她。记者不禁佩服她的胆大、心细、技术高。
    肖素芳去年9月才到兰州热电站工地，那时她还是一个学徒，可是只几个月她就成为五级技工，并且是工地上著名的先进生产者了。
    几个月中她所焊的两百多个高温高压焊口，经过检查、透试和试验，都合乎质量标准。她表示在1957年里，要用自己的双手把兰州建设得更加美丽。
      有缘千里来相会
    一个热闹的婚礼开始了，来宾们挤满在兰州炼油厂工地的食堂里。一对新人穿着漂亮的衣服笑盈盈地坐在前面，人们不断地鼓掌请他们报告恋爱经过。
    新郎名叫于凤阁，去年1月从哈尔滨来到这里，现在是兰州炼油厂工地的技术员，去年9月加入了中国共产党。他曾经在工作中提出很多合理化建议，其中有一项建议，实现后给国家节约了一万多元。由于他工作认真负责，每季都被评为先进生产者。新娘朱传銮是青年团员，南京人。工作积极，受到人们称赞。他俩在1月28日结婚时，还订出了婚后如何生活和今年向科学进军的计划。
      老教授誉满全国
    不久前在德意志民主共和国植物碱会议上受到国际科学家重视的兰州大学化学系教授朱子清，最近因贝母植物碱化学结构的研究有卓越成就，又获得科学院颁发的我国第一次科学奖金。朱子清教授是1955年从上海复旦大学来支援兰州大学的。记者最近见到他，正碰上他去图书馆找寻资料。他说，这几天他总是工作到深夜，正在赶写一篇带总结性的贝母植物碱化的研究论文，准备在即将创刊的兰州大学学报上发表。今年他还要和青年讲师黄文魁、助教倪胤皓等进行关于贝母酵和甘肃岷贝及当归等药材的研究工作，争取在这一年里取得新的成就。
    朱老先生从事科学研究和教学工作已经二十多年。他来到兰州后，克服了在生活和科学研究条件上遇到的种种困难，在工作中取得了成绩，去年曾被甘肃省选为出席全国先进生产者代表会议的教育界代表。为了在西北长期工作，他把将近八旬的母亲，以及爱人和四个小孩都搬来兰州了。
    他们美化了兰州妇女
    一年多以前到过兰州的人都知道，兰州的妇女是爱漂亮的，但是缺乏有经验的理发师和缝纫师，妇女们头发和衣服的式样都很单调。
    自从上海的一大批理发店、服装店迁来兰州以后，兰州的妇女变了，衣着既经济又美观，头发花样也繁多。
    记者访问了从上海迁来的国际理发厅的理发师卜万瑶。这位年青的理发师，一年多以前技术还很差，他为了把妇女打扮得漂亮，常去信向上海的名技师请教，到舞会上去观察妇女们的发式，不断征求顾客对理发的意见。他苦思捉摸出一种发式后，总要先在店内试做，然后才向顾客推荐。因为他的理发是根据不同地区妇女的爱好，脸型的大小瘦胖，因地制宜，因人变化，所以理的发人人满意。
    兰州艺术界的新花朵
    兰州市越剧团——原上海春光越剧团的演员们，春节前忙着赶排新戏“双珠凤”。男主角文必由团长尹树春扮演，女主角霍金定由副团长李慧琴扮演。
    兰州市越剧团自去年8月迁来兰州后，演出了“西楼记”、“二度梅”、“荔枝换红桃”、“白玉传”等优秀的越剧传统节目，观众有十万多人次，差不多每次演出场场客满，原来不大爱看越剧的北方人，现在也对它兴致勃勃。越剧团团长尹树春、副团长李慧琴、田振芳最近还被甘肃省、兰州市各族人民先后选为人民代表大会代表或聘为政协委员。
    决心在兰州住下去
    兰州市食品公司第三十九猪肉门市部的职工们，春节前夕给上级写了决心书，保证要安心在兰州工作，做好春节的肉食供应。这个门市部的职工们在写决心书前有这样一段故事：原来他们几个月前到兰州来的时候，还带着在上海的营业执照。他们想：如果兰州不好呆，回上海后有营业执照还可以挂牌营业。
    他们到兰州后，住的地方比较偏僻，生活比上海苦一些，六个人中就有五个不安心工作。
    记者问他们这次为什么写决心书时，他们说：原先他们只知道兰州比上海苦，却不知道他们门市部供应的对象正是许多大工业建设的工人，在上海那能见到这样的大工业。原来，兰州市的大工业建设鼓舞着他们。后来他们看到工人们有时出来买肉，影响到工作，他们就把肉送到工地去卖。为了改进卖肉工作，他们一个月来还提出了十三件合理化建议。
