Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: The representatives from various provinces attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference continued to discuss Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui's report in the afternoon of the 22nd. The focus of today's discussion was on the third and fourth sections of the report.

After listening to the report, the representatives were even more confident about continuing to promote advanced production technologies and experiences in the future. Many representatives planned to raise this year's production increase targets.

Zhu Xipeng, the head of the Yishan Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province, which achieved excellent results in promoting advanced production technology last year, said that as long as it is adapted to local conditions, and promoted steadily after consulting with farmers, farmers will welcome good methods of increasing production. He said that this year they will continue to vigorously expand the planting area of ​​improved varieties and improve the standards of close planting based on the soil quality and labor situation of each agricultural cooperative. The director of the Gaoli Agricultural Cooperative in Yibin County, Sichuan Province, said that they benefited from promoting double-cropping rice last year, and this year the planting area of ​​double-cropping rice will be expanded from 279 mu last year to 785 mu, and the yield per mu will be strived to reach 1,050 jin. He said that based on the harvest of their double-cropping rice last year, it is entirely possible to reach this level. The directors of the other twenty-eight agricultural cooperatives and farm managers in Sichuan Province, after studying the advanced experiences exchanged at the meeting, were also full of confidence in increasing the yield per mu to over 1,000 jin.

In the speeches of the representatives, it was recognized that implementing the principles of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and democratic management of cooperatives is the key to developing agricultural production and running cooperatives well. Cao Yuming, the director of the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Anci County, Hebei Province, where all members increased their income last year, said that the reason their production is so good is mainly that production and construction work is often discussed with the members, and their correct opinions are adopted. At the same time, educating members to establish the idea of ​​taking the cooperative as their home is also very important. Some representatives from other provinces and regions, when discussing these issues, also talked about their past experiences and shortcomings in these areas, and put forward suggestions for improving future leadership work.

In the evening, the Ministry of Agriculture held a film evening to entertain all the representatives attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference.

    农业劳动模范代表继续讨论邓子恢报告
    推行先进技术的信心更加坚定
    新华社22日讯　22日下午，全国农业劳动模范代表会议各省代表，分别继续讨论国务院副总理邓子恢的报告。今天着重讨论的是报告的第三、第四两个部分。
    听了报告以后，代表们对于今后要继续推行先进的生产技术和经验的信心更为坚定了。许多代表对今年的增产指标又打算提高。
    去年在推广先进生产技术方面成绩很好的浙江省平阳县宜山区农业技术推广站的站长朱锡蓬说，只要因地制宜，和农民商量稳步推广，农民对好的增产办法是欢迎的。他说，他们今年将继续大力推广良种的种植面积和根据各个农业社的土质、劳力情况来改进密植标准。四川省宜宾县高梨农业社主任说，他们去年推广双季稻得到了好处，今年双季稻的种植面积要从去年的二百七十九亩扩大到七百八十五亩，并且每亩的产量要争取达到一千零五十斤。他说，根据他们去年种植的双季稻的收成来看，要达到这样的水平是完全可能的。四川省其他二十八个农业社的主任和农场场长在研究了会上交流的先进经验以后，也都满怀信心地要把每亩地的产量提高到一千斤以上。
    在代表们的发言中，都认识到贯彻执行勤俭办社和民主办社的方针是发展农业生产和办好合作社的关键。去年全部社员都增加了收入的河北省安次县红星农业社的主任曹玉明说，他们生产所以好，主要是生产建设工作经常和社员商量，并且采纳他们正确的意见，同时，教育社员确立以社为家的思想也是很重要的。其他省区的有些代表在讨论这些问题的时候，也都谈到过去在这些方面的经验和缺点，并且提出了改进今后领导工作的意见。
    晚上，农业部举行了电影晚会，招待出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的全体代表。
