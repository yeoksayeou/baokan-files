Talking About Beijing's Herbal Medicine Shops
Qin Mu

Every person who visits Beijing for the first time has a sightseeing itinerary in mind. In addition to the nationally admired and world-renowned Tiananmen Square, Zhongnanhai, the Palace Museum, and the new buildings in the western suburbs, people also have their own places they are eager to see. Some plan to ride camels at the Badaling Great Wall, some want to touch the lions on the Lugou Bridge, some want to taste涮羊肉 (shuan yangrou, hot pot with lamb) and Peking duck, and some will definitely not overlook the Dong'an Market and Tianqiao... As for me, when I first went to Beijing, my itinerary also included a small item: to take a look at Beijing's herbal medicine shops.

Beijing's herbal medicine shops are truly "of great significance." The two world-shaking discoveries in Chinese archaeology in the past sixty years—the discovery of Oracle bone script in the Ruins of Yin and the discovery of "Peking Man" fossils in Zhoukoudian—are both very closely related to Beijing's herbal medicine shops.

In 1899, Wang Yirong, the Imperial Supervisor of Instruction of the Qing Dynasty, bought a dose of medicine from the Tongrentang Pharmacy in Beijing because he suffered from malaria, and it contained so-called "dragon bones." Wang Yirong discovered Yin Dynasty characters on these ancient and mottled oracle bones, which aroused the interest of many archaeologists, who followed the trail from the herbal medicine shop to the medicine stall, from the medicine stall to the merchants, and finally traced it all the way to Xiaotun Village in Anyang, Henan. There they discovered the Ruins of Yin, found more than 160,000 pieces of oracle bones, researched many characters from more than 3,000 years ago, and clarified many clues about the history of the Yin Dynasty.

In 1929, Chinese scientists excavated the skull of "Peking Man" in Zhoukoudian, Fangshan. The discovery of the remains of this ancient human from 500,000 years ago made it possible to arrange the bones of human ancestors unearthed from all over the world into a complete line, thus becoming a world-shaking event. Although the discovery of "Peking Man" was in the late 1920s, the clues to its discovery should be traced back many years. Because more than 20 years before the excavation, someone had already discovered a tooth in a pile of "dragon bones" in a Beijing herbal medicine shop that clearly did not belong to a wild animal. This tooth was called the "Chinese Tooth" and was taken abroad. It was precisely because of this incident that people paid attention, and then there was the systematic discovery of "Peking Man" fossils. Tracing back to the source, Beijing's herbal medicine shops still played an important role.

"Dragon bones, dragon bones!" The two great discoveries of world significance in the Chinese archaeological community at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century were related to it. The recently discovered teeth of the "Gigantopithecus of Guangxi" also began with the study of "dragon bones." Fake dragon bones are indeed China's real treasures. And the inclusive herbal medicine shops, especially the dazzling and diverse Beijing herbal medicine shops, have incidentally played the role of museums in Chinese cultural history.

Therefore, when I went to Beijing, I was determined to visit these street museums. The aura of Beijing's herbal medicine shops is really extraordinary. Unlike the Chinese medicine shops in small places, they display white flower snakes, dried centipedes, seahorses, and sea dragons all in the glass cabinet on the facade for people to see. They have a grand aura, large signs, but most of the medicines are not displayed. The dispensing staff at the counter have a slow, unhurried demeanor. I have also gone in to ask them about the specifications and prices of some medicines. They can talk about many varieties of almost every kind of medicinal material. Just with ginseng alone, they can talk about it endlessly. If you look at a few more herbal medicine shops in Beijing, you will find that the atmosphere of abundant manpower and unhurried dispensing is almost common to all herbal medicine shops.

This aura is completely different from the hurried situation in other stores, and forms a strong contrast. After careful consideration, I feel that the formation of this "herbal medicine shop sentiment" probably has its historical origins. Whether the dispensing of medicine is careful or not concerns human life, how can it be done "as urgently as an imperial decree"? It must be done in a calm and unhurried manner in order to avoid making mistakes. It doesn't matter if food shops and grocery stores are a little tense and hurried, and some restaurants are even afraid of not having a tense atmosphere. Sometimes they even play the radio loudly, the cooks deliberately make the wok sound "dud, dud," and the waiters have to loudly announce the names of dishes such as twice-cooked pork and sweet and sour fish. Others don't know, but when I pass by these food shops, I am often attracted by the sound of the wok and the announcements of the dishes and can't help but run in. But herbal medicine shops are different. If the herbal medicine shops also play the radio loudly and the staff show that they are very busy and nervous, it will not give people a sense of security, because who knows if they will prescribe the wrong medicine in this busy atmosphere?

Therefore, the demeanor of Beijing's herbal medicine shops has its origins. I have seen a batch of prescriptions from the Qing Dynasty. The doctors who prescribed the medicine always wrote words such as "Miss," "Old Lady," and "Young Master" on each prescription first, and then analyzed the condition before prescribing the medicine. This approach and the leisurely and unhurried sentiment of the herbal medicine shop have a common reason. That is: to fully demonstrate care and caution, so that the patient's family and the medicine buyer can feel a sense of security.

I think these Beijing herbal medicine shops may have a bit of inspiration for those engaged in cultural work. Their staff are calm and unhurried, so they can make fewer or no mistakes. Many of our cultural, educational, and health organizations, such as schools, publishing houses, and hospitals, are often as chaotic inside as a pot of boiling water, and the staff also look like bus ticket sellers and restaurant cooks, jumping up and down, turning around and around, and sweating profusely. Due to historical conditions, it is easy to understand that this chaotic situation occurs in a certain period of time, but if it is like this for one year, two years, three years..., for a long time, then it is really worrying! I don't believe that thinkers can grow up in a chaotic situation, that good reading materials can be compiled in a planned way, or that medical treatment can be free of accidents! In this regard, Beijing's herbal medicine shops, these places that have made great contributions to China's cultural undertakings, probably still have much to learn from!

### 谈北京药材铺

    谈北京药材铺
    秦牧
    每一个人第一次到北京，心里总有一张观光节目单。除了全国景仰、举世闻名的天安门、中南海、故宫博物院、西郊新建筑等等之外，人们还有各自渴望看到的地方，有人准备到八达岭骑骆驼，有人想到芦沟桥摸狮子，有人要尝尝涮羊肉和烤鸭，有人决不会忽略东安市场和天桥……。至于我，第一次到北京的时候，我的节目单里也有一个小小的节目，那就是：带便看一看北京的药材铺。
    北京的药材铺，真是“提起此马来头大”。近六十年来中国考古界两项震惊世界的发现——殷墟甲骨文的发现和周口店“北京人”化石的发现，都是和北京的药材铺发生极密切的关系的。
    1899年，清廷的国子监祭酒王懿荣因为患疟疾，在北京同仁堂药铺里买了一剂药，里面杂有所谓“龙骨”。王懿荣从这些古色斑烂的甲骨上发现了殷代文字，于是引起许多考古家闻风追踪，从药材铺追到药栏，从药栏追到行商，最后一直追到河南安阳小屯村去，终于在那里发现了殷墟，陆续找到了十六万多片甲骨，研究出不少三千多年前的文字，弄清了许多殷代历史的线索。
    1929年我国科学家在房山周口店发掘出“北京人”的头盖骨，这五十万年前的古代人类的遗骨的发现，使得世界各地发掘出来的人类老祖宗的骨头逐渐可以排成一个完整的行列，因此成为震动世界的大事。“北京人”的发现虽然在二十年代末，然而它发现的线索却应该上推许多年。因为在发掘之前二十余年，已经有人在北京药材铺里的一大堆“龙骨”中，发现了一枚显然不是属于野兽的牙齿，这齿被人称做“中国牙齿”，并被劫夺到国外去了。正是由于这一回事引起人们的注意，才有以后“北京人”化石的系统的发现。追溯源头，北京的药材铺仍然串演了一个重要的角色。
    “龙骨，龙骨！”十九世纪末和二十世纪初中国考古学界的两项具有世界意义的巨大发现都和它发生关系。最近发现的“广西巨猿”的牙齿也是从研究“龙骨”开始的。假的龙骨倒的确是中国的真正的宝物。而兼收并蓄的药材铺，尤其是琳琅满目，货式繁多的北京药材铺，在中国文化史上竟连带发挥了博物馆的作用。
    因此我上北京时就一心要观光这些街头博物馆了。北京的药材铺，气派真是不同寻常，它不像小地方的中药铺似的，把白花蛇、蜈蚣干、海马、海龙都一古脑儿摆在门面玻璃柜里给人看。它气魄大，招牌大，药物却大都不摆出来。柜面上的配药人员有一种慢条斯理从容不迫的风度。我也曾经进去向他们请教一些药物的规格和价钱。几乎每一种药材他们都可以讲出很多的品种来。单是一样参，他们就可以讲得天花乱坠。你多看几间北京药材铺，就会发现：铺里那种人力充足、配药时从容不迫的气派，几乎是所有药材铺所共有的。
    这种气派，和其他的商店那种忙迫的情形截然不同，而且形成一种强烈的对照。看后仔细想想，觉得这种“药材铺情调”的形成，大概很有它的历史渊源。配药谨慎与否，事关人命，怎能够“急急如律令”那么的搞？一定得从容不迫，才能够做到不出差错。食品铺、杂货铺之类，紧张忙迫一些没有关系，而且，有些饮食馆还唯恐其没有紧张气氛，有时还要大放收音机，厨子还故意把镬子弄得笃笃地响，伙计还要大声念回锅肉、醋溜鱼等菜名。别人不知怎样，我路过这些食物铺时就常常被镬子声、报菜声吸引到难以自制地跑了进去。但药材铺就不同了，假如药材铺也是收音机大唱特唱，店员们表现得十分忙迫紧张，就不能给人一种安全感，因为谁知道他们会不会在这种忙迫气氛中配错了药呢？
    所以，北京药材铺的那种风度是其来有自的。我曾经见过一批清代的药方，开药的医生在每张药方上面总是先写上“小姐”、“老太”“小少爷”之类的字眼，然后分析病情，然后才开药。这种做法，和药材铺那种悠闲不迫的情调有其共同的原因。这就是：充分表现了细心、谨慎，使病人家属，使买药者都获得了安全感。
    我想这些北京药材铺，对搞文化工作的人，恐怕很有点启示作用。它们的人员从容不迫，因此能够少出或不出差错。我们有不少的文化教育卫生团体，像学校、书刊编辑部、医院之类，内部常常忙乱得像一锅滚水似的，工作人员也大有公共汽车售票员、饮食馆厨子那种跳上跳下，转来转去，满头大汗的模样。限于历史条件，在某一时期内出现这种忙乱状况是很易了解的事，但如果一年两年三年……，长期都是这样子，那就真教人捏两把汗！我不相信在忙乱的状况中可以生长思想家，可以有计划地编出好读物，可以使医疗不生事故！在这方面，北京药材铺，这些曾经对中国的文化事业有过巨大贡献的地方，恐怕仍大有值得我们学习之处吧！
