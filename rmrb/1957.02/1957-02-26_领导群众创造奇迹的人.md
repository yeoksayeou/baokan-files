Among the representatives who recently attended the Sichuan Provincial Advanced Producers Conference was He Tianxing, the head of the Cangxi Dongtai Agricultural Cooperative, who had twice overcome flood disasters and achieved bumper harvests. Here, let me introduce how this Communist Party member led the cooperative members to run the cooperative with the same spirit of hard work and simplicity as the Red Army in those years, and how he led the cooperative members to conquer floods.

He Went to a New Battlefront

He Tianxing is fifty years old this year. He was born into an extremely poor family. He herded cattle for others at the age of eight, and worked as a long-term laborer at the age of ten. He escaped and went out at the age of twenty-one. In January 1931, he joined the Red Army in Hubei. In June of the same year, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. He went through the 25,000-li Long March, fought the enemy for more than twenty years, and received three special merits and was wounded twenty-four times. In 1941, he became a battalion commander, becoming an outstanding commander. After liberation, the organization took care of his scarred body and asked him to rest. In 1952, he returned to his long-separated hometown with a disability certificate and his family.

When he returned home, his hometown had already embarked on the road of organization, and mutual aid groups had been established in the village. As soon as he returned home, he devoted himself to the hot agricultural construction, and signed up to join the Liu Guohe mutual aid group. He worked hard with the team members from morning till night, and learned long-forgotten farm work such as using cattle and transplanting seedlings. At the same time, he often publicized the party's policies to the team members, understood the living conditions of the team members, and educated the team members to actively work, develop production, and strive to build cooperatives. The county magistrate, the township head, the team leader, and his relatives all advised him: Look at your body full of holes, you should have a good rest and not overwork. However, this hero who had been tested by gunfire, this Communist Party member who regarded the interests of the people above all else, believed that he could not give up labor or work under any circumstances. When the cooperative was established in the autumn of 1954, the members were already familiar with his noble qualities of wholeheartedly serving the masses, and everyone unanimously elected him as the director of the cooperative.

"Good Head of the Family"

After He Tianxing became the director of the cooperative, in handling various issues within the cooperative, he showed the spirit of a Communist Party member and veteran Red Army soldier of caring for the masses, being selfless, and working hard and simply everywhere.

The winter before last, he saw that some poor cooperative members in the cooperative were having difficulties in life. Cooperative member Ren Shuzhen had no house to live in, Li Dengzhi had no quilt, Tao Jiafa had no bed to sleep on, and more than a dozen cooperative members had no shoes to wear when it was frosty and snowy. He felt very sad. The cooperative had not been established for long and was facing economic difficulties. He took out his own disability pension to help Ren Shuzhen repair her house, bought a bed for Tao Jiafa, and gave his beloved quilt to Li Dengzhi. At the same time, he also consulted with the cooperative cadres and used part of the cooperative's public welfare fund to buy three zhang of cloth to make shoes for the cooperative members who had no shoes, so that these cooperative members could work with peace of mind.

Last spring, the Dongtai cooperative merged into a large cooperative. Some cooperative cadres believed that the cooperative was large and should pay attention to pomp, advocating building three brick and tile houses as offices; pulling wires from the city to install electric lights; buying a radio; and planning to buy 200 silkworm baskets, four walking plows, 3,000 jin of oil cake, and 8,000 jin of ammonium sulfate in production. He Tianxing calculated that buying these things would cost at least 1,500 yuan. The cooperative had just been established, and it was not right to spend money on things that were not urgently needed. He patiently persuaded the cooperative cadres to run the cooperative frugally. As a result, the houses were not built, the electric lights were not installed, the radio was not bought, and in addition to repairing the original silkworm rearing equipment and renting those of the cooperative members, only fourteen more were added. At the same time, the cooperative members were mobilized to accumulate 120,000 jin of fertilizer, reducing the number of fertilizers purchased.

Last spring, many cooperative members felt that they had no change to use, and their enthusiasm for production was not high. He Tianxing went deep into the situation and found that one of the reasons for the lack of change was that the cooperative members' household sideline businesses had not been developed. Only 142 pigs were raised in the 172 households in the whole cooperative, and no one was engaged in other sideline businesses. The main reason why sideline businesses could not be developed was the lack of pig feed, and the cooperative members had no money to buy pigs to feed. After He Tianxing and the cooperative cadres studied the matter, in addition to using the cooperative's money as loans to buy back more than 130 pigs, he himself also took out 300 yuan of disability pension to buy pigs for the cooperative members to feed. The cooperative also opened a feed processing plant, and set aside a certain amount of time for the cooperative members to collect wild feed, which solved the feed problem, and the number of pigs in the whole cooperative increased. In terms of raising chickens, He Tianxing mobilized his wife to take the lead in hatching chicks, leading the whole cooperative to hatch more than twenty nests of chicks. After the spring sowing was completed, the remaining labor force was arranged to engage in processing work, and a total of more than 1,600 yuan of processing fees was obtained throughout the year.

In the first half of last year, the thirty-eight silkworms raised in the cooperative had no leaves to eat. Many cooperative cadres and cooperative members advocated dumping the silkworms into the dung pit to make fertilizer. He Tianxing felt that the silkworms were fat and plump and really couldn't bear to dump them, so he organized the cooperative members to go to Langzhong to buy leaves, and pick up mud leaves at the foot of the mulberry trees, wash them with water and feed them. In this way, the harvested spring cocoons sold for a total of 687 yuan.

He Tianxing is a person who loves labor. Although he is fifty years old, he still gets up every day when the rooster crows and checks the production in each team by moonlight. Sometimes he passes through three or four teams before it dawns. Once, he found that more than 49 mu of fields in teams one, five, and six were short of water. He carried his bedding and lived in team five, personally leading the cooperative members to turn water and find water sources, and organized seven water-lifting buckets, which lifted water for one month and nine days, and all the fields were filled with water and planted with seedlings.

Because He Tianxing cares very well about the production and the lives of the cooperative members, the cooperative members all say that he is a "good head of the family."

In Front of the Great Flood

Last summer, the Dongtai cooperative led by He Tianxing experienced a severe test. In May, just as the green soybeans and corn were growing more than two inches deep, the Jialing River rose sharply, and 284 mu of crops in the whole cooperative were flooded. After the flood receded, He Tianxing immediately led the cooperative members to make up for the loss caused by the flood. The whole cooperative immediately dispatched 147 laborers and 44 head of cattle, working day and night to rush to cultivate and replant, and the 284 mu of land was replanted in four days and four nights.

The replanted crops had just emerged from the soil when the second, even larger flood came, and the originally green field turned into a vast expanse of water again. He Tianxing had been injured many times and was originally very weak. After the first flood, he worried, got rained on, and overworked, and his body was already ill. But as soon as the second flood came, he threw himself into the rescue work despite his illness. He told everyone to remain calm and helped the cooperative members grab things. Suddenly, he heard that the house of military family member Xue Chunhe was about to be washed away by the water. Regardless of his illness, he immediately jumped into the waist-deep torrent and, together with Communist Party member Liu Guohe, rushed to the house that was about to be washed away. After half an hour of fighting, they finally tied the house to a big tree with a rope.

After going ashore, He Tianxing was exhausted. That night, his illness worsened; coupled with the losses of the cooperative tormenting him, he did not sleep well all night. The next day, as soon as it dawned, he went to the river. A desolate scene after being washed away by the water appeared before his eyes. More than 300 mu of crops in the river dam area were all washed away, and 39 houses were washed away and collapsed. How would the cooperative members live in the future? He Tianxing, who had never shed tears when bullets hit him in the past when fighting the enemy, could not help crying sadly this time. But difficulties cannot scare strong people. With the encouragement and support of the party organization, he was determined to mobilize the masses to make up for the losses caused by the flood. But when he returned home, he was too ill to get out of bed. There was no way but to ask his wife to find the cadres of the cooperative to come to the bedside for a meeting. At the meeting, it was decided to distribute several hundred yuan in cash from the cooperative to the disaster-stricken cooperative members to repair their houses and help the disaster-stricken households settle down temporarily. At this time, many cooperative members became pessimistic and lost confidence in replanting. He Tianxing also encouraged the cadres and party members to go to various groups separately to persuade those who were wavering and boost their morale despite his illness. After four days and four nights of intense labor, and with the support of a large number of peasant brothers from Yunfeng Township, the whole cooperative replanted sweet potatoes and corn in the fields damaged by the flood.

In order to make up for the losses in the cooperative, He Tianxing was looking for production tricks while walking, sitting, and lying down. He remembered that there were still several barren terraces on Baihe Mountain. He personally went to conduct a survey, and then mobilized 34 cooperative members to reclaim wasteland. Under the scorching sun, it took three days and three nights to reclaim five and a half mu of wasteland and plant sweet potatoes. He also widely opened up sideline production channels. During the autumn harvest, he went to various teams to check the harvesting situation, so that each team could rationally allocate labor, harvest carefully, and reduce waste. In addition, the government's relief funds were used to help disaster-stricken households repair their houses and solve their living difficulties.

After the autumn harvest, the Dongtai cooperative unexpectedly spread the good news of a bumper harvest, and the total agricultural production of the whole cooperative increased by more than 23%. The total agricultural and sideline income increased by 46.37% compared with 1955. More than 3,000 jin of corn and more than 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes were also harvested on the flood-stricken land. The cooperative members all increased their income, and they could not finish eating the distributed grain.

This is how He Tianxing, under the leadership of the party and the government, and together with the members of the Dongtai cooperative, created the miracle of overcoming the biggest flood in fifty years and achieving a bumper harvest.

    领导群众创造奇迹的人

    最近出席四川省先进生产者会议的代表中，有两次战胜洪水灾害、获得丰收的苍溪东台农业社社主任何天星。这里，让我介绍一下这位共产党员是怎样以当年红军的艰苦朴素的精神领导社员办社，领导社员征服洪水的。
    他到了新的战线
    何天星今年五十岁了。他出身在一个极贫苦的家庭里，八岁给人放牛，十几岁当长工，二十一岁时逃跑出外。1931年1月，他在湖北参加了红军。同年6月，光荣地加入了中国共产党。他经过二万五千里长征，和敌人战斗了二十多年，立过三次特等功，负伤二十四次。1941年他当了营长，成为一个卓越的指挥员。解放后，组织上照顾他遍身伤痕的身体，要他休养。1952年他才带着残废证和家人一起回到久别的家乡。
    当他回到家里的时候，家乡已经走上了组织起来的道路，村里成立了互助组。他一回到家，便投入火热的农业建设中去，他报名参加了刘国和互助组。他起早贪黑地和组员一块劳动，学会了久已生疏了的使牛、栽秧等农活。同时，经常向组员宣传党的政策，了解组员生活情况，教育组员积极劳动，发展生产，争取建社。县长、乡长、组长和亲人们都劝他说：看你一身都是窟窿，也该好好休息，不要劳动过度了。可是，这位经过枪林弹雨考验的英雄，这位把人民利益看得高于一切的共产党员，他认为自己无论如何不能放弃劳动、不干工作。当1954年秋后建社时，社员们都已熟知他一心为群众办事的崇高品质，大家一致选他当了社主任。
    “好当家人”
    何天星当了社主任以后，在处理社内各项问题上，处处表现了共产党员、老红军战士关心群众、大公无私、艰苦朴素的精神。
    前年冬天，他看见社里有些贫苦社员生活困难，社员任淑贞没房子住，李登治没被盖，陶家法没床睡，还有十多个社员打霜下雪都没鞋穿。他心里很难过。社办了不久，经济困难。他就把自己的残废金拿出来，帮任淑贞修了房子，给陶家法买了一架床，又把自己心爱的被盖送给了李登治。同时，又找社干部商量，用社内部分公益金扯了三丈布给没鞋穿的社员做鞋子穿，使这些社员能安心地生产。
    去年春天，东台社并成了大社。有的社干部认为社大了，应该讲点排场，主张修三间砖瓦房做办公室；从城里牵电线来安装电灯；买一部收音机；在生产上又计划买蚕簸箕二百张、步犁四部、油枯三千斤、硫酸錏八千斤等。何天星算了一下，买这些东西最少要花一千五百元。社刚建立，把钱花在不是迫切需要的地方是不应该的。他耐心说服社干部要勤俭办社。结果房子没有修，电灯没有安，收音机没有买，蚕具除修补好原有的和租包社员的以外，只添了十四张，同时还发动社员积了十二万斤肥，减少了购买肥料的数字。
    去年春天，许多社员感到没零钱用，生产情绪不高。何天星深入了解了这方面的情况，发现缺零钱用的原因之一是社员家庭副业没搞起来，全社一百七十二户社员只养猪一百四十二只，其他副业都没人搞。而副业搞不起来的原因主要是缺猪饲料，社员没钱买猪喂。何天星和社干部研究后，除将社内的钱作为贷款买回一百三十多只猪外，他自己还拿出三百元残废金给社员买猪喂。社内又开办一个饲料加工场，抽出一定时间让社员采集野生饲料，解决了饲料问题，全社的生猪增加了。在养鸡上，何天星动员自己的爱人带头抱小鸡，带动全社抱出小鸡二十多窝。大春下种结束后，又将剩余劳动力安排来搞加工工作，全年共得加工费一千六百多元。
    去年上半年，社里喂的三十八张蚕没有叶子吃了。许多社干部、社员主张把蚕子倒下粪坑凑肥。何天星看到蚕儿肥滚滚的实在舍不得倒，便组织社员到阆中去买叶子，和捡桑树脚下的泥巴叶子，用水洗净喂。这样，收获的春茧共卖了六百八十七元。
    何天星是个热爱劳动的人，虽然他五十岁了，每天仍然鸡叫起床，借着月光到各队去检查生产。有时走过三、四个队天才亮。有一次，他检查出一、五、六队有四十九亩多田断水。便背起被盖住在五队，亲自领导社员翻水、找水源，组织了七台戽水篼，戽了一个月零九天，把田全部关上水，栽上了秧子。
    由于何天星对社内生产和社员生活都关心得很周到，社员都说他是一个“好当家人”。
    在大水灾前面
    去年夏天何天星领导的东台社经历了一次严重的考验。5月份，正当青油油的黄豆、苞谷长到二寸多深的时候，嘉陵江水暴涨，全社庄稼被淹没了二百八十四亩。洪水退后，何天星马上领导社员弥补水灾损失。全社当即出动了一百四十七个劳动力、四十四头耕牛，日夜抢耕抢种，四天四夜就将这二百八十四亩地抢种完了。
    补种的庄稼刚刚出土，第二次更大的洪水又来了，原来绿油油的一片田野又变成一片汪洋。何天星身体多次受伤，本来很衰弱，在第一次洪水后，又操心，又淋雨，又劳累，身体已经拖病了。但第二次洪水一来，他又带病投入抢救工作。他一面叫大家镇静，一面帮助社员抢东西。忽然听说军属薛春和的房子要被水冲走了，他不顾身体有病，立即跳入齐腰的急流中，和共产党员刘国和一起向快被水冲走的房子扑去。经过半小时的搏斗，终于用绳子把房子拴在大树上了。
    上岸后，何天星已经精疲力竭了。当晚，病更加重；加上社里的损失折磨着他，他一夜都没有睡好。第二天，天刚亮，他就到河边去。他眼前出现了一片被水冲刷后的荒凉景象。河坝地的三百多亩庄稼全部冲光，还冲走和冲垮了三十九间房子。以后社员们的生活怎么过呢？过去同敌人战斗，枪弹击中自己都没掉过泪的何天星，这次忍不住伤心地哭了。但困难吓不倒坚强的人，在党组织的鼓舞和支持下，他决心发动群众弥补洪灾带来的损失。但是回到家里，他病得爬不起来了。没有办法，只好叫妻子去把社上的干部找到床前来开会。会上决定把社内几百元现金分给受灾社员来修房子，帮助受灾户暂时安居下来。这时候，许多社员悲观了，对补种失去了信心。何天星又带病鼓动干部、党员分头到各组去说服那些动摇的人，把他们的情绪鼓动起来。经过四天四夜的紧张劳动，又得到了云峰乡大批农民弟兄的支援，全社又在洪水冲坏的田地里，抢种上红苕和苞谷。
    为了弥补社内损失，何天星行走坐卧都在寻找生产窍门。他想起白鹤山还有几道荒坪，他亲身去进行了勘查，然后动员了三十四名社员来开荒。在火热的太阳光下，花了三天三夜时间开垦了五亩半荒地，栽上了红苕。他又广泛地开辟副业生产门路。秋收时，他去各队检查收割情况，使各队做到合理调配劳力，细收细打，减少抛撒。此外，又用政府拨的救济款帮助受灾户培修了房子，解决了生活困难。
    秋收完了，东台社里出人意外地传出了丰收喜讯，全社农业增产了23％以上。农业、副业总收入比1955年增加了46.37％。在受灾的那片土地上也收获了三千多斤苞谷、一万多斤红苕。社员户户都增加收入，分的粮食吃不完。
    何天星就是这样，在党和政府的领导下，和东台社员一起创造了战胜五十年来未有的大洪水并得到丰收的奇迹。
