Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 26th: According to news from Hong Kong: The United States is supporting an anti-Chiang Kai-shek movement in Taiwan, fostering a group of more pro-American so-called "free elements" to confront Chiang Kai-shek, in order to facilitate the United States' deepening of its enslavement and control over the Taiwan authorities under the guise of divide and rule.

Currently, the anti-Chiang Kai-shek movement in Taiwan is centered around the so-called "Free China Fortnightly" incident. "Free China Fortnightly" is a publication directly supported by the United States, published in Taipei by Hu Shih, Lei Chen, and others. This publication, taking advantage of Chiang Kai-shek's public solicitation of opinions before his 70th birthday, published a special issue "celebrating" Chiang Kai-shek's birthday in early November last year, featuring more than a dozen articles that coldly ridiculed Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, newspapers and periodicals published in Hong Kong and elsewhere with American funding also published articles attacking Chiang Kai-shek to "celebrate" his birthday. The main thrust of these statements was to have Chiang Kai-shek cede military, political, and party power to more pro-American "free elements." In an article sent by the United States to "Free China Fortnightly" for publication, Hu Shih wanted Chiang Kai-shek to be a "brainless, incompetent, and inactive" figurehead in Taiwan.

These anti-Chiang Kai-shek remarks aroused great vigilance from the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities, who immediately mobilized Kuomintang newspapers and periodicals to fight back. However, with the backing of the United States, "Free China Fortnightly" and others refused to be outdone. Therefore, for several months, the "pro-American and anti-Chiang faction" and the "pro-Chiang and resentful-of-America faction" in Taiwan and Hong Kong have been constantly attacking each other, making a lot of noise.

According to Taiwanese individuals who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Taipei, although Chiang Kai-shek personally issued a statement on the 9th of this month in an attempt to suppress the offensive of the "pro-American and anti-Chiang" elements, many "pro-American and anti-Chiang" pamphlets appeared in Taipei again in mid-February. These pamphlets were transported to Taiwan by American planes and warships. Its general content is "to oppose communism, it is necessary to first oppose Chiang." Among them, a booklet in both Chinese and English called "The Way to Solve the China Problem" openly advocated that Chiang Kai-shek retire and that a "new government" be formed by more pro-American so-called "free elements" such as Hu Shih and Yu Bin. It also advocated that Taiwan should truly become "America's defense front in the Far East," and that all Kuomintang troops should be "handed over to the jurisdiction of the United Nations," that is, directly commanded by the United States. After these pamphlets appeared, the Kuomintang authorities immediately sent people to search and confiscate them, but some had already reached readers.

This time, the United States' instigation of more pro-American so-called "free elements" and its use of the Kuomintang officials' depressed emotions to launch a political offensive against Chiang Kai-shek occurred after the Taiwan authorities gradually revealed resentment towards the increasing control of the United States. On October 13 of last year, the United States announced the removal of Ingersoll from his concurrent position as commander of the Seventh Fleet and sent him to serve as the commander of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, stationed in Taiwan to uniformly command the U.S. military and Kuomintang troops in the Taiwan area. At the same time, the power of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan was also expanded, with full responsibility for handling military assistance allocated to Taiwan. In this way, the United States' military control over Taiwan was further deepened. Since then, the remarks made by Hu Shih, the head of the so-called "free elements," in the United States, criticizing the Kuomintang, have increased compared with the past, and he has also put forward proposals such as "destroying the Kuomintang." Another puppet of the United States, Liao Wenyi, the so-called "provisional chairman of the Republic of Taiwan," also recently issued a roar in Japan, demanding that the United States "strengthen its vigilance" over the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan politically and militarily. The U.S. State Department also suddenly released a document called the "1942 White Paper on Sino-U.S. Relations" on December 1 of last year, revealing the facts that the Kuomintang government had wavered in its resistance against Japan and was corrupt and incompetent during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The white paper also stated: "Using our (referring to the United States) influence to enable liberal elements to be in a leading position in the Chinese government (referring to the Kuomintang regime) is one of the main tasks of the post-war period," and other words to cheer on the so-called "free elements" in Taiwan.

News from Hong Kong shows that the United States does not have any particular preference for the so-called "free elements," but only uses them to weaken the power of the Taiwan Kuomintang faction, in order to facilitate the United States' further deepening of its control over Taiwan. Once their usefulness is exhausted, the fate of these "free elements" will obviously not be better than the situation of the Taiwan Kuomintang faction, which still retains part of its military power, relying on others and being at the mercy of others. Under this anti-Chiang political offensive orchestrated by the United States, the Taiwan Kuomintang faction has felt that relying on external forces to maintain the situation, being at the mercy of others, and being likely to be sacrificed and die at any time, and therefore generally feels uneasy.

### 美国企图加深奴役和控制台湾  策动更加亲美的分子削弱国民党当权派的势力

    美国企图加深奴役和控制台湾
    策动更加亲美的分子削弱国民党当权派的势力
    新华社广州26日电　据香港方面消息：美国正在台湾支持一个反对蒋介石的运动，扶植一批更加亲美的所谓“自由分子”与蒋介石相抗衡，以便利美国在分而治之的诡计下加深对台湾当局的奴役和控制。
    目前台湾的反对蒋介石运动，正环绕着所谓“自由中国半月刊”事件进行。“自由中国半月刊”是美国直接支持的胡适、雷震等在台北市出版的刊物。这家刊物借蒋介石在七十岁生日前公开征求意见的机会，在去年11月初出版了一期替蒋介石“祝寿”的专号，刊登了十多篇对蒋介石冷嘲热讽的文章。与此同时，美国人出钱在香港等地出版的报纸刊物，也纷纷刊登攻击蒋介石的言论来替他“祝寿”。这些言论的主要精神是要蒋介石让出军权、政权、党权给更加亲美的“自由分子”。胡适在由美国寄给“自由中国半月刊”发表的文章中，要蒋介石在台湾做一个“无智、无能、无为”的空头首脑。
    这些反对蒋介石的言论引起台湾国民党当局很大的戒心，随即动员国民党报刊群起反击。但是，由于有美国的撑腰，“自由中国半月刊”等也不甘示弱。因此，几个月来，台湾和香港等地的“拥美反蒋派”和“拥蒋怨美派”之间，不断互相攻讦，吵吵闹闹。
    据最近从台北到达香港的台湾人士说，虽然蒋介石在本月9日亲自发表谈话，企图对“拥美反蒋”分子的攻势加以压制；但是，台北市面在本月中旬又出现了许多“拥美反蒋”的小册子，这些小册子是由美国飞机和军舰运进台湾的。它的总的内容是“反共必先反蒋”。其中有一本汉英文对照的名为“解决中国问题的途径”的小册子，公开主张蒋介石退休，另外由胡适、于斌等更加亲美的所谓“自由分子”组成“新政府”，并且主张台湾应该真正成为“美国在远东的国防前线”，国民党军队全部“交给联合国管辖”，也就是交给美国直接统率。这些小册子出现后，国民党当局即派人予以搜查没收，但一部分已经流入读者手中。
    美国这次策动更加亲美的所谓“自由分子”和利用台湾国民党官员的苦闷情绪，发起反对蒋介石的政治攻势，是在台湾当局对美国的加强控制逐渐流露忿怨以后发生的。去年10月13日，美国宣布解除英格索尔原任第七舰队司令的兼职，派他专任美军协防台湾司令部司令，驻在台湾统一指挥台湾地区的美军和国民党军队。同时美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的权力也加以扩大，全权负责处理拨交台湾的军事援助。这样，美国对台湾的军事控制进一步加深了。此后，所谓“自由分子”首脑胡适在美国发表的抨击国民党的言论即较前增多，还提出“毁弃国民党”等主张。美国的另一个傀儡、所谓“台湾共和国临时主席”汉奸廖文毅最近在日本也发出嘶喊，要美国在政治上和军事上对台湾蒋介石集团“加强警惕”。美国国务院在去年12月1日也突然发表了被称为“1942年中美关系白皮书”的文件，披露抗日战争期间国民党政府曾经对抗战动摇和贪污无能的事实。白皮书中还说：“利用我们（指美国）的影响使自由主义分子能够在中国政府（指国民党政权）中处于领导地位是战后时期的主要任务之一”等语，来替台湾的所谓“自由分子”打气。
    香港消息表明，美国对所谓“自由分子”并不是有所偏爱，只不过利用他们来削弱台湾国民党当权派的势力，便利美国进一步加深对台湾的控制。鸟尽弓藏，这些“自由分子”的结果，显然不会比还保留着一部分军事实权的台湾国民党当权派寄人篱下的境遇更好些。而台湾国民党当权派人士在美国策动的这种反蒋政治攻势下，已经感到依赖外力维持残局，俯仰由人，随时有被人牺牲、死亡无日的可能，因而普遍感到不安。
