Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 12th: The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Wuhan Municipal New Joint Public-Private Enterprise Grassroots Political Work Conference concluded on the 11th. More than 1,600 Party, government, and trade union cadres from joint enterprises and related leading departments attended the meeting. The conference focused on studying how to strengthen the political and ideological work of joint public-private enterprises in light of the changes in enterprise nature, class relations, and other aspects brought about by the implementation of the overall joint public-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce. The conference also exchanged experiences in the work of grassroots Party branches in the new joint enterprises and the implementation of democratic management.

The meeting believed that Wuhan's capitalist industry and commerce had achieved considerable success in all aspects since the implementation of overall joint public-private ownership for a year. For example, the total output value of the new joint ventures last year increased by 59% compared with 1955, and labor productivity increased by more than 26%. Appropriate arrangements were made for the original capitalists and capitalist agents; and more than 490 outstanding employees were promoted to leadership positions in the enterprises. The working conditions and welfare of the employees have also been improved to a certain extent, and so on. The meeting also examined the shortcomings in last year's work, and believed that the main shortcomings last year were the relative neglect of the work of the masses of employees, the failure to pay sufficient attention to relying on the working class, and the failure to give full play to the role of the masses of employees in participating in enterprise management; the education of employees on the policy of redemption was not deep or thorough enough, and many workers' sense of ownership has not yet been clearly established, and they do not understand the significance of the redemption policy sufficiently, which has caused dissatisfaction among many workers. In addition, the phenomenon of rigidly copying the management system of state-owned enterprises also occurred in the operation and management of some joint ventures; and there were also serious waste phenomena in many enterprises.

The meeting believed that these problems must be solved from the ideological and organizational systems in the future. First of all, it is necessary to clarify the view of relying on the working class to realize the transformation of enterprises and the transformation of people, and systematically and deeply publicize the Party's redemption policy to the masses of employees; pay attention to cultivating and promoting workers to assume leading positions in enterprises. Secondly, the system of employee representative conferences or general employee meetings should be tried out in joint ventures to improve and expand the democratic management system of enterprises.

    根据企业性质和阶级关系等方面的变化
    武汉将加强公私合营企业基层政治工作
    据新华社武汉12日电　中共武汉市委员会召开的武汉市新公私合营企业基层政治工作会议，已在11日结束。出席会议的有合营企业及有关领导部门的党、政、工会干部一千六百多人。这次会议着重研究了如何根据资本主义工商业在实行全行业公私合营以后所引起的企业性质、阶级关系等各方面的变化，来加强公私合营企业的政治思想工作问题，会上并交流了新合营企业基层党支部的工作和实行民主管理的经验。
    会议认为，武汉市资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营一年来，各方面都取得了不少成绩。如新合营工业去年的生产总值比1955年增长了59％，劳动生产率提高了26％以上。对原来企业的资本家和资方代理人，进行了适当的安排；并提拔了四百九十多名优秀职工担任企业的领导工作，职工群众的劳动条件和生活福利也有一定程度的改善等等。会议也检查了去年工作中的缺点，认为去年的主要缺点是对职工群众的工作比较忽视，未能充分注意依靠工人阶级，发挥职工群众参与企业管理的作用；对职工进行赎买政策的教育不深不透，很多工人的主人翁思想还没有明确树立，对赎买政策的意义也不够了解，不少工人因而产生了不满情绪。此外，在部分合营企业的经营管理上也发生了硬搬国营企业的一套管理制度的现象；也有不少企业存在着比较严重的浪费现象等。
    会议认为今后必须从思想上和组织制度上来解决这些问题。 首先必须明确依靠工人阶级实现对企业改造和对人的改造的观点，系统地、深入地向职工群众宣传党的赎买政策；注意培养和提拔工人担任企业的领导职务。其次要在合营企业中试行建立职工代表大会或全体职工大会制度，来健全和扩大企业的民主管理制度。
