Old Tales of Qiongliu Township
--Vietnamese Sketches
Yuan Ying

In the rainy October weather, we traveled south along Highway One. This highway, parallel to the railway line, runs from Lang Son through Hanoi, traversing north to south all the way to Saigon; the Vietnamese call it the “Thousand-Li Road.” Today, this “Thousand-Li Road” is interrupted at the 17th parallel. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is currently repairing the railway line leading to the central region. As we passed the Black River and arrived in Ninh Binh province, we saw a bustling scene with railway workers at the Black River Bridge construction site.

After passing Gia Khanh, the car turned northwest. At this point, we reached the southernmost point of our trip to Vietnam. Due to time constraints, we were unable to visit the Fourth Interzone. Of course, it was even more impossible to visit the picturesque southern region south of the 17th parallel. The previous evening, at a dinner hosted by the Ninh Binh Provincial Department of Culture, we raised our glasses to bless the people of the South and agreed with our Vietnamese friends to visit the South together in the future.

Leaving Highway One, the car embarked on a relatively rugged mountain road, the highway passing through Phu Nho Quan and Hoa Binh, and heading towards Son La. Ninh Binh province is the smallest and least populated province in the Third Interzone. The car traveled almost continuously through uninhabited hills.

Qiongliu Township, which we were going to visit, is a famous old revolutionary base area in Ninh Binh province. As early as around 1930, it became a fortress in the struggle against the French colonialists. Under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, the people waged anti-tax struggles, launched armed uprisings, and planted the red flag of revolution on this land.

Our car stopped. A group of people was waiting for us on the muddy road. Among them were several elderly people leaning on canes. They were the heads of the Qiongliu Township Party, government, and mass organizations. Several of the elderly with long silver-white beards were veteran Communist Party members.

The elderly people grasped our hands and said:
“We are so happy to welcome you here!”
As for ourselves, from the moment we arrived in Ninh Binh and heard that we were going to visit an old base area, our hearts began to stir.

We arrived at a waterside and boarded a ferry. This was a small boat unique to Ninh Binh, woven from bamboo and rattan. The old woman rowing the boat waved her oars, not with her hands, but with her feet. One foot stepped on one oar, moving up and down, and the small boat parted the waves and sailed to the opposite bank.

On the opposite bank of the ferry crossing, two old women wearing conical hats stood in the rain, as if waiting for the ferry. Unexpectedly, as soon as we landed, they walked over, grabbed our hands, and said:
“You've come! You've come!”
It turned out that these two old women were residents of Qiongliu Township. Hearing that we were coming, they had been waiting at this ferry crossing early in the morning. We had not been able to arrive at the agreed time, causing them to stand in the rain for a long time.

We entered Qiongliu Township surrounded by these kind and enthusiastic old men, old women, young people, and children.

These touching hosts of Qiongliu Township, while asking us questions on the road, also pointed out and told us: under that big tree, the enemy had brutally murdered the Party branch secretary of that year; in front of that small temple, the guerrillas had chopped two Japanese officers to death; in that cowshed, a meeting of senior Party cadres had been held...

Zhang Wensi, one of the old Party members of Qiongliu Township (he joined the Party in 1933), began to introduce us to the glorious history of Qiongliu Township in a spacious tile-roofed house. The old men, old women, and other villagers sat inside the house, while others stood outside. People continued to gather from all directions. Only a few words had been spoken in the house, and the outside was already a dense mass of people.

At this time, someone came in and said: The folks in the township heard that Chinese friends had come and all wanted to meet them, so everyone was waiting and wouldn't leave. At this point, the Party branch secretary suggested that we simply talk outside so that everyone could see us.

Thus, the following scene formed: we sat at the table, interviewing several veteran Party members and taking notes; a dozen old men sat around the table, talking with us; outside the circle, men and women, old and young, surrounded us layer upon layer...

The conversation began by talking about 1930. Every Vietnamese remembers 1930 because in the early part of that year, the Indochinese Communist Party was born. From that day on, on the disaster-ridden land of Vietnam, in the long night, there was an inextinguishable beacon. The people of Qiongliu Township especially remember 1930 because in that year, they began a large-scale organized struggle against the French colonial rulers.

In that year, Ninh Binh province was suffering from famine. In every village, people were struggling on the brink of starvation; but the French colonialists and their agents still imposed heavy taxes and levies on the common people. Under the leadership of the Bac Ky Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party, the torch of the anti-tax struggle burned from Qiongliu Township. It burned from the township to the county, and from the county to the province. A long procession of mass demonstrations marched into the provincial capital and surrounded the governor's residence. The governor tried to stop the angry crowds with troops and cars, but the masses were not afraid. On the ancient streets of Ninh Binh City, for the first time, the cries against exorbitant taxes and levies and against tyranny resounded, forcing the reactionary rulers to bow their heads for the first time.

From then on, Qiongliu Township became a thorn in the enemy's side. The following year, the Governor of Ninh Binh sent people to Qiongliu Township to erect boundary stones on all cultivated land, counting Qiongliu Township as his private property. The Party mobilized the people to defend their land. As soon as the boundary stones were erected during the day, they were all pulled out at night. When the reactionaries failed with one plan, they came up with another: they transferred many troops and horses from the provincial capital, intending to launch a major sweep. The defenders of Qiongliu Township sent people to stand guard by the roadside. As soon as the enemy's cars appeared in the distance, they immediately notified everyone. At that time, there were no weapons, so everyone took sticks and ropes and ambushed in the fields. As soon as the enemy got out of the car, the ambushers rushed out together, catching them off guard. The struggle went on day and night, and the enemy never managed to occupy the village.

In 1941, Qiongliu Township officially established a guerrilla team and engaged in armed struggle. Without weapons, they went to raid the enemy's sentry posts. When the guerrilla team was first established, there were only four guns plus broadswords and bows and arrows. A revolutionary base area centered on Qiongliu Township, including five townships, was established, inserting a dagger into the enemy's heartland.

In the following years, armed struggles became frequent. The French colonial army came to invade and was repulsed; the invading army of Japanese imperialism came to "sweep" and was also repulsed. In 1945, the base area expanded to seven townships, and the struggle became even more arduous and fierce. Once, the Party led the people to open five warehouses of the nearby Japanese army, distributing grain on the one hand and publicizing on the other. They had just managed to move everything out when the Japanese devils came from the province in large numbers. The Party immediately mobilized the people to strengthen the defenses and clear the fields, not leaving a single grain for the enemy. The leading organs of the base area moved to a small cliff to persist in the battle. The enemy army entered the village, searched and arrested wantonly, and brutally murdered the secretary of the Party branch; however, the people immediately avenged him, chopping two Japanese devil officers to death with knives.

In this way, the people of Qiongliu Township, with one heart and one mind, united around the Party, experienced arduous years of struggle, and persisted until the August General Uprising of 1945.

We felt very sorry that, due to time constraints, we did not have the opportunity to ask the people of Qiongliu Township to continue to tell us how they spent the even more arduous eight years of the War of Resistance. However, this did not diminish our respect for this heroic base area and its heroic sons and daughters in the slightest. "A single spark can start a prairie fire," we once again experienced this truth in this township.

The ideals of the revolutionary heroes of Qiongliu Township in those years are gradually being realized in the days when the sun shines brightly. Eight months ago, land reform was completed here. In this township with a population of 3,500 people and 5,000 mu of land, 36 mutual aid teams have been established. On the land once congealed with blood, people are welcoming the first bumper harvest after land reform.

Please imagine how touching the scene was when we had to get up and say goodbye. The old men waved their canes, showing kind smiles from behind their white beards; the old women opened their mouths to smile, their teeth shining brightly; the young people and children clapped their hands, laughing and talking; our translator could not convey what they said for a while. He could only summarize:
"They said please send their regards to the Chinese people!"

The rain was heavier than when we came. But still many villagers sent us all the way to the waterside, and stood in the rain still waving.

The speed of the ferry was slower - was it because of the heavy rain, or because we brought back so many heroic deeds of Qiongliu Township and the friendship of the people of Qiongliu Township towards the Chinese people? (Attached picture)
The people of Qiongliu Township warmly bid farewell to the Chinese brothers who visited them.

    琼流乡话旧
    ——越南随笔
    袁鹰
    10月的阴雨天，我们沿着一号公路南行。这条公路同铁路线平行，是从谅山经过河内、纵贯南北一直通向西贡的大道，越南人唤它叫“千里路”。如今，这“千里路”在十七度线上中断了。越南民主共和国政府现在正在修复通往中部的铁路线。我们过黑水河来到宁平省的时候，便看见黑水河大桥的工地上，熙熙攘攘，全是铁路工人。
    过了左干，汽车折向西北行。至此，我们就到了这次访问越南的行程的最南端了。由于时间关系，我们不能到第四联区去。当然，更不可能到十七度线以南风光如画的南部地区去了。前一天晚上，在宁平省文化厅的晚餐席上，我们曾举杯为南部人民祝福，并且同越南朋友相约将来一起去访问南方。
    汽车离开了一号公路，就驶上了一条比较崎岖的山间公路，这是经府儒关、和平，到山萝去的公路。宁平省是第三联区面积最小、人口最少的省份，汽车几乎一直是在没有人烟的丘陵间奔驰的。
    我们要去访问的琼流乡，是宁平省内一个著名的革命老根据地。早在1930年左右，这里就成为反抗法国殖民者的斗争的堡垒。人民在印度支那共产党的领导下，进行了抗税的斗争，搞武装起义，一直把革命的红旗插在这块土地上。
    我们的汽车停了下来。在泥泞的路上，有一群人在等候我们。其中有好几位拄着手杖的老者。他们是琼流乡党、政和群众团体的负责人，那几位飘着银白色长髯的老者，有的是老共产党员。
    老年人拉住我们的手，说：
    “能欢迎你们来，我们真是太高兴了！”
    而我们自己呢，从来到宁平省，听说要访问一个老根据地的时候，心便开始激动着了。
    我们来到一个水荡边，上了渡船。这是宁平省特产的用竹和藤编成的小船。划船的老大娘，挥动双桨，不是用手，而是用脚。一只脚踩住一支桨，一上一下，小船便分波逐浪，驶向对岸。
    对岸渡头有两位戴着斗笠的老大娘站在雨地里，像是在等着渡船。不料我们一上岸，她们便走过来，拉住我们的手说：
    “你们来啦！你们来啦！”
    原来这两位老大娘都是琼流乡的居民，听说我们要来，今天一早就在这渡口等着了。我们没有能按约定的时间到达，使她们在雨地里多站了好久。
    我们就在这些好心的、热情的老大爷、老大娘、年轻人和孩子们的簇拥下，走进琼流乡。
    这些令人感动的琼流乡的主人们，在路上一面向我们问长问短，一面又指点着告诉我们：在那一棵大树下，敌人曾经怎样残杀了当年的党支部书记；在那一座小庙前，游击队曾经怎样劈死了两个日本军官；在那个牛棚里，曾经举行过党的高级干部会议……
    琼流乡的老党员之一张文思（他是1933年的党员），在一间宽敞的瓦房里开始向我们介绍琼流乡的光荣历史。老大爷、老大娘和别的老乡们，有的坐在屋内，有的站在屋外。人们还是不断地从四面聚拢来。屋里才谈了几句话，屋外已经是黑压压的一片了。
    这时有人进来说：乡里的老乡们听说来了中国朋友，都想要见见面，所以大家全等着不散。这时，党支部书记便建议我们干脆到屋外去谈话，让大家都能看到。
    于是，便形成了这样的场面：我们坐在桌子旁边，向几位老党员采访，记着笔记；十几位老大爷坐在桌子四周，同我们谈话；在圈子外边，男男女女，老老小小，一层又一层地围着……
    谈话一开头就讲到1930年。每一个越南人都记得1930年，因为这一年年初，印度支那共产党诞生了。从那天起，越南的多灾多难的土地上，在漫漫的长夜里，有了一盏不灭的明灯。琼流乡的人民特别记得1930年，是因为在那一年，他们对法国殖民统治者开始了有组织的大规模的斗争。
    那一年，宁平省正遇着灾荒，在每一个村子里，人们都在饥饿线上挣扎；可是法国殖民者和他们的代理人，仍然把沉重的苛捐杂税压到老百姓身上。在印度支那共产党北圻圻委的领导下，抗税斗争的火把从琼流乡燃烧起来了。从乡里烧到县里，从县里烧到省里。长长的群众示威的行列，一直走进省城，包围了省长的官邸。省长想用军队和汽车拦住愤怒的人群，但是群众毫不惧怕。在宁平市的古老的街道上，第一次响彻了反对苛捐杂税、反抗暴政的呼声，迫使反动统治者第一次低下头来。
    从此，琼流乡便成了敌人的眼中钉。第二年，宁平省长派人到琼流乡来，在所有的耕地上立起界石，把琼流乡算作他的私人田产。党发动人民维护自己的土地。只要白天刚立上界石，夜里就给它一齐拔掉。反动派一计不成，又生一计：从省城调来许多兵马，想来个大扫荡。琼流乡的守卫者就派人在公路边放哨，一见远远地出现敌人的汽车，马上通知大家。当时没有武器，各人就拿了棍子和绳子，埋伏到田里。只等敌人一下车，伏兵齐出，打他们个措手不及。斗争日以继夜、夜以继日，敌人始终占不了村子。
    1941年，琼流乡正式成立了游击队，搞武装斗争。没有武器，就去摸敌人的岗哨。开始建立游击队的时候，只有四枝枪加上大刀和弓箭。成立了以琼流乡为中心的包括五个乡的革命根据地，在敌人的腹地插进了一把匕首。
    这以后的几年中，武装斗争就频繁了。法国殖民军来侵犯过，被打退了；日本帝国主义的侵略军来“扫荡”过，也被打退了。1945年，根据地扩大到七个乡，斗争也更艰苦更剧烈了。有一次，党领导人民打开附近日军的五个仓库，一面分粮食，一面宣传，刚来得及搬完，日本鬼子就从省里大队地开来了。党立刻动员人民坚壁清野，不给敌人留下一颗粮食。根据地的领导机关，转移到一个小山崖上去，坚持战斗。敌军进了村子，大肆搜捕，残杀了党的支部书记；可是，人民立刻替他复了仇，用刀劈死了两个日本鬼子的军官。
    就这样，琼流乡的人民，一心一德，团结在党的周围，经历了艰苦的斗争岁月，坚持到1945年的八月总起义。
    我们觉得十分遗憾：由于时间关系，我们没有机会再请琼流乡的人们为我们继续讲述怎样度过更加艰苦的抗战八年。可是，这丝毫也没有减损我们对这个英雄的根据地和它的英雄的儿女们的崇敬。“星星之火，可以燎原”，在这个乡里，我们再一次体会了这个真理。
    琼流乡当年的革命志士们的理想，在阳光普照的日子里逐步实现了。八个月以前，这里已经完成了土地改革。在这个拥有人口三千五百人、土地五千亩的乡里，已经建立了三十六个互助组。在曾经凝结着鲜血的土地上，人们正迎接着土地改革后的第一个大丰收。
    请想像一下，当我们不得不起身告辞的时候，那情景是怎样地动人吧。老大爷们摇动着手杖，从白胡子后面露出亲切的笑容；老大娘们张开笑口，她们的牙齿闪闪发光；年轻人、孩子们，拍着手，笑着，说着；我们的翻译员一时竟来不及转达他们和她们说了些什么。他只能概括地说：
      “他们说请你们向中国人民问好！”
    雨势比来时更大。可是依然有许多老乡们一直送我们到水荡边，站在雨地里还不住挥手。
    渡船的速度缓慢些了，——是雨大了的缘故呢，还是由于我们带回了如此多的琼流乡的英雄业绩和琼流乡人民对中国人的情谊呢？（附图片）
    琼流乡人民热情欢送去访问他们的中国兄弟。
