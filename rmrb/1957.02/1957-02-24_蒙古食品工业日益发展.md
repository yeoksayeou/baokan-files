Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, February 23rd: The Mongolian food industry sector will construct four flour mills, one confectionery factory, and one mechanized dairy processing plant this year.

    After the completion of these flour mills, they can process 50% of the flour consumed by the people nationwide. The confectionery factory will be able to produce 50 tons of pastries and sweets annually, and the dairy processing plant can process 15,000 liters of fresh milk every eight hours.

    Mongolian Minister of Food Industry, Luvsanchultem, told Xinhua reporters that now all seventeen provinces of Mongolia have food processing factories, and there are more than 270 small-scale cream factories throughout the country. Mongolia established the Ministry of Food Industry in 1941. By 1955, the output of the food industry had increased by approximately four times compared to the early days of its establishment, and in 1956, the production volume of the food industry increased by another 5.9% compared to the previous year.

    Before 1941, although Mongolia was a country mainly engaged in animal husbandry, the cream needed by urban people still had to be imported from foreign countries. Since the establishment of cream factories in various places, in addition to meeting the needs of the people, it has also been exported to foreign countries. The cream exported now can be exchanged for more than 30,000 tons of flour annually.

    The minister said that Mongolia has completed 101.2% of the production tasks for the first four years of the second Five-Year Plan for the food industry. This year, in addition to building factories, it will also expand some existing factories to meet the growing needs of the people.

    蒙古食品工业日益发展
    新华社乌兰巴托23日电　蒙古食品工业部门今年要兴建四个面粉厂、一个点心工厂和一个机械化的乳品加工厂。
    这些面粉厂建成以后，可以加工全国人民食用面粉的50％，点心工厂能够年产点心和糖等五十吨，乳品加工厂每八小时就可以加工一万五千公升鲜奶。
    蒙古食品工业部长鲁布桑乔姆博尔向新华社记者说，现在蒙古的十七个省都有食品加工工厂，全国各地共有二百七十多个小型奶油工厂。蒙古在1941年成立了食品工业部，到1955年，食品工业的产量比成立初期增加约四倍，1956年食品工业的生产量又比上一年增加了5.9％。
    在1941年以前，蒙古虽然是一个以畜牧业为主的国家，但是城市人民所需要的奶油还要靠从外国进口，自从各地奶油工厂建立起来以后，除供应本国人民需要外，还向外国出口。现在一年输出的奶油可以换回三万多吨面粉。
    这位部长说，蒙古已经完成食品工业第二个五年计划头四年的生产任务的101.2％，今年除兴建工厂外，还要扩大现有的一些工厂，以满足人民日益增长的需要。
