    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th: At the Credentials Committee meeting of the UN General Assembly on the 12th, Soviet representative Sobolev requested the committee to refuse to recognize the credentials of the Taiwan Kuomintang elements to attend the United Nations. However, Sobolev's proposal was opposed by representatives of the United States and other countries, and the result of the vote was seven votes against two, and it was rejected. The representative of Burma voted in favor of the Soviet proposal.
    At the committee meeting that day, a proposal put forward by US representative Wadsworth was also passed by eight votes to one, and this proposal suggested that the validity of the credentials of the Hungarian delegation attending the United Nations be left as an open question. Soviet representative Sobolev voted against this proposal.
