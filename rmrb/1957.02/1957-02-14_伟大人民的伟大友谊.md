The Great Friendship of Great Peoples
Soviet Choral Conductor Expert Lie·Ni·Dumashefu

February 14th of this year marks the seventh anniversary of the signing of the "Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

For the past seven years, every day has confirmed the enormous development of the friendship between our great peoples, and the cooperation in economics, science, and culture.

Recently (January 7th-11th and 17th-19th, 1957), the government delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet government delegation, headed by Ni·Ya·Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, held talks in Moscow with unprecedented achievements, and signed the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement on January 18th this year.

Also on January 18th this year, the cultural agreement between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China for 1957 was signed in Beijing. This agreement was formulated based on the existing agreement on cultural cooperation between the two countries. The Soviet side was signed by Ni·Ya·Mikhailov, Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, on the plan, and the Chinese side was signed by Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China. These two documents are a new stage of further development in the cause of the "Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" signed in 1950.

Art plays a very important and huge role in the closeness and mutual understanding between peoples. The Soviet Cultural Newspaper of January 10th, 1957, in commenting on the "Chinese Art" concert held at the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall on January 8th, wrote: To better understand the lives of the people, one must understand their art. Nothing can reveal the soul of the people, their thoughts, expectations and hopes, their joy and happiness as completely and fully as songs, dances and literature. The great Russian writer Maxim Gorky said, "Songs are the soul of the people." The great modern Chinese composer Xian Xinghai wrote in "Folk Songs and China's Emerging Music": Folk songs truly express the emotions of the people, so they are welcomed by the general public and passed down. Therefore, every Chinese music concert in our country (recalling the successful tour of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1954, the Yue Opera Troupe in 1955, and the performance of the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe in 1956) is so warmly welcomed by Soviet audiences, who are eager to further understand and become familiar with the soul of their close friend—the great Chinese people.

Our people have become familiar with and fallen in love with many unique songs of the Chinese people. These songs ripple in the clubs of collective farms and on the stage of the Moscow Soviet Building. These songs are "People of the World are of One Heart" written by Qu Xixian, the folk song "The East is Red" adapted by He Luting (and Li Huanzhi), "Alamu Khan" adapted by Xie Gongcheng... etc. These songs have become the repertoire of many professional and amateur choral groups in our country.

Participating in the concert held at the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow on January 8th, 1957 were Soviet performing groups (the Russian A Cappella Choir of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, whose artistic director is the Honored Artist of the Republic, Ya. Se. Stepanov; the All-Union Radio Choir, whose artistic director is A.S. Ondrusenko; actors from the Yev. Vakhtangov Satire Theater, as well as actors from the Moscow Music Hall, pianist Le. Sozina and violinist Sobolevsky). Young Chinese actors studying at Moscow Higher Art Schools also participated in the concert.

The concert program featured musical works created by Chinese composers Ma Sicong, He Luting, and Ding Shande. Chinese folk songs, excerpts from Chinese playwrights' dramas, and poems by Chinese poets were performed, and so on.

Under the direction of Comrade Yan Liangkun, conductor of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra of the People's Republic of China (who is about to graduate from the Moscow Conservatory Research Class), the Russian Republic A Cappella Choir sang three songs: the Xinjiang folk song "Alamu Khan" adapted by Xie Gongcheng and two a cappella choral songs, one being the folk song "Half a Moon Climbing Up" adapted by Cai Yuwen and Yang Jiaren, and the other being the Inner Mongolian folk song "Pastoral Song" adapted by Qu Xixian.

Wang Xixian and Jiang Zuhui, students of the ballet directing department of the Lunacharsky Institute of Drama, successfully performed the humorous Chinese dance "Little Cowherd." The audience also heard new Chinese songs for our country, which were sung by the All-Union Radio Choir. Such as Nie Er's characteristic "Song of the Road", "Waterwheel Song" and "Lament on the Lake" adapted by Sha Mei, He Luting's (and Li Huanzhi's) distinctive Shaanxi folk song "The East is Red", and Wang Xin's solemn and optimistic "Ode to the Motherland" in a major key. This song ended this meaningful "Chinese Art" concert.

On the other hand, the great Chinese people warmly welcomed the art and culture of the fraternal Soviet people that enabled them to understand. The concert of Russian and Soviet vocal choral works held at the Beijing Theater on December 22nd and 23rd, 1956, also received the same warm welcome from the Beijing audience.

The program performed by the choir and solo group of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra of the People's Republic of China in these two concerts, whether solo, various choruses, ensembles, or large-scale opera choruses, received a wide response. Most of the mixed chorus pieces were a cappella works. While singing Glinka's solemn patriotic song "Moscow", they also sang Polonsky's lyrics, the pearl of Russian classical choral works—Taneyev's most difficult choral work "Look, How Big the Mist," and the straightforward Russian folk song "On the Other Side of the Forest" adapted by Svinishnikov; at the same time, they also sang Tchaikovsky's touching work "Golden Clouds of the Night" and Aliabyev's brilliant "Nightingale" (a cappella chorus, coloratura soprano solo).

In addition to singing delicate a cappella chorus works, the Central Philharmonic Orchestra Choir also sang large-scale works such as: the third section of "Great Chorus of the Motherland," "Ode to Labor" (composed by Arutyunyan, conducted by Ren Ce), "Ukrainian Epic" (composed by Alexandrov, led by Yang Huatang, conducted by Shi Mingxin), "A Scene Before Execution" from the opera "Yemelyan Pugachev" (composed by Ma. Kovali, leaders: Pugachev - Yang Huatang, Ustinia - Cai Huanzhen, Ulyana - Xie Jingqin, conducted by Qiu Li).

The female chorus movingly sang "Fly Away on the Wind" (selected from Borodin's opera "Prince Igor") and "Wedding Chorus" and "Antonia's Romance" (selected from the opera "Ivan Susanin", led by He Zhi).

The Chinese audience also welcomed with great care the outstanding choral work "At Ten Versts Away" (lyrics by Fu. Ekiet). This work was created by Alexander Davidenko, one of the pioneers of Soviet modern classical choral works. The chorus is dedicated to the martyrs of the "Bloody Sunday" of the first Russian Revolution on January 9th, 1905. The people's sorrow, anger, resistance, and their call to avenge the martyred comrades were vividly reflected in the expressive music.

Here, the audience praised the three young choral conductors Ren Ce, Qiu Li, and Shi Mingxin who participated in these concerts. They demonstrated their various talents in these difficult and diverse concert programs (especially Comrade Shi Mingxin, who movingly conducted Alexandrov's dramatic work "Ukrainian Epic"). I have already mentioned the skills of the fourth conductor of this choir, Comrade Yan Liangkun, above (he conducted at the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow on January 8th this year).

In addition to the Russian and Soviet vocal and choral repertoire performed by the choir of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra of the People's Republic of China listed above, the orchestra of the group (conducted by Comrades Han Zhongjie and Zhang Ninghe) and the solo group also had the following Russian classical works performed: the overture to Glinka's opera "Ruslan and Lyudmila" and "Madrid Night", Tchaikovsky's fourth and fifth symphonies and his ballet suite "Swan Lake", Lyadov's "Eight Russian Folk Song Suites", Opus 58, and Borodin's symphonic poem "In the Steppes of Central Asia."

The symphony works of Soviet modern composers, which were also recognized by the Chinese audience, include: Sergei Prokofiev's symphony, the fairy tale "Peter and the Wolf," and Aram Khachaturian's ballet fragment "Sabre Dance," and so on.

In the sixth part of the Sino-Soviet Joint Statement of January 18th, 1957, it is written: "The friendly solidarity of China and the Soviet Union is one of the most important factors in the great solidarity of socialist countries. The two sides noted with great satisfaction that since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in 1950, the friendly cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union have greatly developed, and the peoples of the two countries have consistently united."

The concert of Russian and Soviet vocal choral works held in Beijing in 1956 and the "Chinese Art" concert held in Moscow on January 8th, 1957, are also examples of the ever-consolidating great friendship of the great peoples.

Beijing, January 27, 1957

    伟大人民的伟大友谊
    苏联合唱指挥专家　列·尼·杜马舍夫
    今年2月14日是中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的“友好同盟互助条约”签订的七周年纪念日。
    七年来，过去的每一天都证实着我们伟大人民之间友谊的巨大发展，和在经济、科学和文化方面的合作。
    最近（1957年1月7日——11日和17日——19日），以中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来同志为首的中华人民共和国政府代表团，和以苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁为首的苏联政府代表团，在莫斯科举行了有着空前成就的会谈，并于今年1月18日在中苏联合声明上签了字。
    也是今年1月18日在北京签订了苏联和中华人民共和国1957年的文化协定。这个协定是根据现有的两国文化合作协定而制定的。苏联方面由苏联文化部长尼·亚·米哈伊洛夫在计划上签字，中国方面由中华人民共和国文化部长沈雁冰签字。这两份文件乃是继1950年所签订的“友好同盟互助条约”事业中进一步发展的新阶段。
    艺术对人民之间的亲近和互相了解，起着极重要而又巨大的作用。1957年1月10日的苏联文化报在评论1月8日在柴可夫斯基音乐厅举行的“中国艺术”的音乐会一文中写道：为了更好地了解人民的生活，必须了解他们的艺术。什么也不能像歌曲、舞蹈和文学那样完整而充分地揭出人民的灵魂，他们的思想、期待和希望，他们的快乐和幸福。伟大的俄罗斯作家马克西姆·高尔基说过“歌曲是人民的灵魂”。现代的伟大的中国作曲家冼星海在“民歌与中国新兴音乐”一文中写道：民歌真实地表现着人民的情绪，所以才能为一般人所欢迎，并流传下来。因此，在我们国家里的每一个中国音乐的音乐会（回想1954年中国人民解放军歌舞团成功的巡回演出，1955年越剧团和1956年上海京剧院的表演）是那样热烈地被苏联的听众所欢迎，他们渴望着更进一步地了解和熟习自己亲密的朋友——伟大中国人民的灵魂。
    我们的人民已经熟习并爱上了很多中国人民独特的歌曲。这些歌曲荡漾在集体农庄的俱乐部里，和莫斯科苏维埃大厦舞台上。这些歌曲是瞿希贤写的“全世界人民心一条”、贺绿汀（和李焕之）改编的民歌“东方红”、谢功成改编的“阿拉木汗”……等等。这些歌曲都成了我国许多的专业和业余合唱团体的保留节目。
    参加1957年1月8日在莫斯科柴可夫斯基音乐厅举行的音乐会演出的有苏联演出团体（俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国俄罗斯无伴奏合唱团，这个团的艺术指导是共和国功勋演员亚·谢·斯捷潘诺夫；全苏广播合唱团，团的艺术指导是阿·斯·昂德芦森科；叶夫·瓦赫旦杰夫、讽刺剧院的话剧演员，以及莫斯科音乐馆的演员、钢琴家列·索茜娜和提琴家索波列夫斯基），在莫斯科高等艺术学校留学的中国青年演员也参加了这次音乐会的演出。
    在音乐会的节目中，表演了中国作曲家马思聪、贺绿汀和丁善德所创作的音乐作品。表演了中国民歌、中国剧作家的戏剧片断以及中国诗人的诗等等。
    在中华人民共和国中央乐团的指挥严良堃同志（他即将在莫斯科音乐学院研究班毕业）的指挥下，俄罗斯共和国无伴奏合唱团演唱了三首歌曲：谢功成改编的新疆民歌“阿拉木汗”和两首无伴奏合唱歌曲，一是蔡余文、杨嘉仁改编的民歌“半个月亮爬上来”，一是瞿希贤改编的内蒙古民歌“牧歌”。
    卢纳戈尔斯基戏剧研究院芭蕾导演系的学生王希贤和蒋祖惠极成功地表演了风趣的中国舞蹈“小放牛”。音乐会的听众也听到了对我国来说是新的中国歌曲，这些歌曲是由全苏广播合唱团演唱的。如聂耳的富于特色的“大路歌”，和沙梅改编的“车水歌”、“湖上悲歌”，贺绿汀（和李焕之）改编的鲜明的陕北民歌“东方红”以及王莘所写的庄严、乐观的大调性的“歌唱祖国”。并以此歌结束了这一场富有意义的“中国艺术”的音乐会。
    另一方面，伟大的中国人民极其热烈地欢迎了能使他们了解的兄弟般的苏联人民的艺术和文化。1956年12月22日、23日北京剧场举行的俄罗斯和苏联声乐合唱作品演奏会，也获得了北京市听众同样的热烈欢迎。
    中华人民共和国中央乐团合唱队和独唱组在这两个音乐会上所演唱的节目，无论是独唱、各种合唱、重唱以及大型的歌剧合唱都获得了广泛的反应。在混声合唱曲中占大部分的是无伴奏合唱作品。在演唱格林卡的庄严的爱国主义歌曲“莫斯科”的同时，也演唱了波隆斯基作词的、俄罗斯古典合唱作品的珍珠——塔涅耶夫最难的合唱作品之一“你看，多么大的云雾”，和率真的俄罗斯民歌、斯维尼什科夫改编的“在森林的那一边”；同时也演唱了柴可夫斯基的感人的作品“宿夜的金云”，和阿里亚比也夫的辉煌的“夜鹰”（无伴奏合唱、花腔女高音独唱）。
    除了演唱细致的无伴奏合唱作品外，中央乐团合唱队也演唱了大型的作品如：“祖国大合唱”中的第三段“劳动赞”（阿鲁秋年作曲，任策指挥），“乌克兰史诗”（亚历山大罗夫作曲，杨化堂领唱、施明新指挥），“叶米里扬·布加乔夫”歌剧中“临刑的一场”（马·柯瓦里作曲，领唱者：布加乔夫——杨化堂，乌斯齐尼娅——蔡焕真，乌里扬娜——谢静琴，由秋里指挥）。
    女声合唱极感人地演唱了“乘风飞去”（选自鲍罗廷的歌剧“伊戈尔王”）及“婚礼合唱”和“安东尼达浪漫曲”（选自歌剧“伊凡·苏萨宁”，何芝领唱）。
    中国的听众也以极大关怀的心情欢迎了卓越的合唱作品“在十俄里的地方”（甫·埃基埃特作词）。这个作品是苏联现代古典合唱作品首创人之一亚历山大·达维坚科所创作，该合唱是献给1905年1月9日第一次俄罗斯革命“血腥星期天”的烈士们的。人民悲哀、愤怒、反抗的心情，和他们为殉难同志们复仇的号召，这一切在有表现力的音乐中获得了鲜明的反映。
    在这里，听众对参加这几次音乐会的三位青年合唱指挥任策、秋里和施明新同志给以好评。他们在这几场艰巨和多样化的音乐会节目中，表现了他们各方面的才能（特别是施明新同志，他感人地指挥了亚历山大罗夫的充满戏剧性的作品“乌克兰史诗”）。有关这个合唱团的第四个指挥严良堃同志的技能，我已在上面提过（他曾于今年1月8日在莫斯科柴可夫斯基音乐厅指挥过）。
    除了以上列举的中华人民共和国中央乐团合唱队所演唱的俄罗斯和苏联声乐及合唱保留作品外，该团交响乐队（指挥是韩中杰及张宁和同志）和独奏组也有如下的俄罗斯古典作品演出节目：格林卡的歌剧“卢斯兰和留得米拉”序曲和“马德里达之夜”，柴可夫斯基第四、第五交响乐和他的芭蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”组曲，里亚多夫“八首俄罗斯民歌组曲”、作品第五十八号，以及鲍罗廷的交响诗“在中亚细亚草原”。
    受到中国听众公认的也有苏联现代作曲家的交响乐作品：谢尔盖·普罗科菲耶夫的交响乐，童话“彼得和狼”和阿拉姆·哈恰图良的芭蕾舞片断“马刀舞曲”等。
    在1957年1月18日的中苏联合声明第六部分中写道：“中国和苏联的友好团结是社会主义国家伟大团结的一个最重要的因素。会谈双方极为满意地指出，自从1950年中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结以来，中苏两国的友好合作关系有了巨大的发展，两国人民始终如一地团结一致”。
    1956年在北京举行的俄罗斯、苏联声乐合唱作品演奏会，和1957年1月8日在莫斯科所举行的“中国艺术”音乐会，也是伟大人民的伟大友谊日益巩固的范例之一。
