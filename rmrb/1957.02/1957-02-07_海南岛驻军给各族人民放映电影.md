Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 5th. During the Spring Festival, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed on Hainan Island dispatched thirty-one film projection teams to screen films for the island's residents.

    The projection team members of a certain army unit stationed in the mountains climbed mountains and crossed rivers to screen films for members of minority agricultural cooperatives. Local male and female members welcomed them with firecrackers. Many minority men and women who lived far from the projection sites also dressed in festive attire, walked along narrow paths from mountain gullies and deep forests, and came to watch, singing beautiful mountain songs. After watching the films, some Li people went home and picked coconuts and bananas growing next to their houses to treat the PLA projectionists. Some Li elders even wanted to cook for the projectionists, but they were declined.

    When a film projection team from a certain naval unit sailed by boat to Liudao Township to screen films, they first asked the local Li people what kind of films they wanted to see. Everyone unanimously requested to see films with Chairman Mao or films about the People's Liberation Army fighting. The naval film projection team then screened for them the newsreel about the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the feature film "Footprints," which reflects the story of border defense against the enemy. When the image of Chairman Mao and the PLA officers and soldiers appeared on the screen, warm applause resounded throughout the venue.

    The film projection teams of these units have received many letters of thanks from people of all ethnic groups. The film projection team of a certain naval unit also received two banners presented by the Sanya Fishery Production Cooperative, one of which read: "Military-Civilian Unity, Defend the Coastline."

### 海南岛驻军给各族人民放映电影

    海南岛驻军给各族人民放映电影
    新华社海口5日电　驻守海南岛的中国人民解放军各部队春节期间派出三十一个电影放映队，给岛上居民放映电影。
    驻守在山区的陆军某部的放映队队员们，爬山涉水为少数民族农业社社员放映电影，当地男女社员放着鞭炮欢迎。许多远离放映地点的少数民族男女也都穿着节日的盛装，从山沟里、深林中，踏着羊肠小道，唱着优美的山歌，赶来观看。有些黎族人民看完了电影以后，回家将自己房屋旁边生长的椰子、香蕉摘下来，招待解放军的放映员们。有的黎族老人还要做饭给放映员们吃，被放映员们谢绝了。
    海军某部电影放映队乘着小艇航海到六道乡放映电影的时候，首先征求了当地黎族人民愿意看什么样的影片。大家一致提出要看有毛主席的或解放军打仗的电影。海军电影放映队便给他们放映了关于中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的新闻简报和反映边防对敌斗争的故事片“脚印”。当银幕上出现了毛主席和解放军官兵的形象的时候，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    这些部队的电影放映队都收到了各族人民的许多感谢信。海军某部电影放映队还接受了三亚渔业生产合作社献给的两面锦旗，有一面锦旗上写着：“军民团结，保卫海防”。（附图片）
