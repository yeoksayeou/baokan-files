    According to the Gansu Daily: Sunan Yugur Autonomous County has vigorously promoted animal husbandry production by developing and strengthening its Party organization. In 1956, the autonomous county, in conjunction with central tasks such as grassland planning and mutual aid and cooperation in animal husbandry, recruited 197 new Party members (including 25 female Party members) from various ethnic groups, including Yugur, Mongolian, Tibetan, Tu, and Han. Temporary Party branches have been established in six townships, strengthening the Party's leadership over rural work and promoting the smooth development of production work. For example, Kangle Township in Kangle District originally planned to mate 2,200 ewes, but due to insufficient and superficial policy publicity, herders had concerns, and only 1,800 ewes were actually reported for mating. In response to this situation, the Party branch convened a meeting of Party members, assigned tasks to the members, and sent them to the villages to publicize the benefits of mating to the herders. As a result, 2,800 ewes were mated.

    肃南裕固族自治县党组织发展壮大
    有力地推动了牧业生产
    本报讯　据甘肃日报消息：肃南裕固族自治县由于发展壮大了党组织，有力地推动了牧业生产。该自治县于1956年结合草原规划、畜牧业互助合作等中心工作，在裕固族、蒙古族、藏族、土族、汉族等各族群众中发展了一百九十七名新党员（内有女党员二十五名），并已在六个乡建立了临时党支部，加强了党对乡村工作的领导力量，推动了生产工作的顺利开展。如康乐区康乐乡原计划配种母羊二千二百只，由于政策宣传不深不透，牧民群众有顾虑，实报的配种母羊仅一千八百只。党支部针对这种情况召集党员开会研究，给党员布置了任务，分头下村向牧民宣传配种的好处，结果配种的母羊达到二千八百只。
