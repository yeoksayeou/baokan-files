Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 2nd: The fishermen of the Zhoushan Archipelago produced 3.28 million dan of fish last year, an increase of 280,000 dan compared to 1955, and nearly double the production of 1952. They have already overfulfilled their fishery production tasks for the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Last year was the first year for the Zhoushan Archipelago to realize advanced fishery cooperation. Fishery cooperatives universally launched advanced producer movements, greatly improving the utilization rate of production tools and labor. The number of production units going out to sea for fishing during the spring and summer fishing seasons last year increased by 989 compared to the same period last year. The number of production units going out to sea for hairtail fishing during the winter season also increased by more than 200 compared to the same period in 1955. During each fishing season, fishery cooperatives in various regions actively carried out technological reforms, changing low-yield operations to high-yield operations, improving fishing gear, and promoting advanced experiences, which played a significant role in overfulfilling the production plan.

    舟山群岛渔民
    去年增产鱼二十八万担
    新华社杭州2日电　舟山群岛的渔民去年产鱼三百二十八万担，比1955年增产二十八万担，比1952年增产近一倍。他们第一个五年计划的渔业生产任务已经提前超额完成。
    去年是舟山群岛实现高级渔业合作化的第一年，各渔业社普遍展开了先进生产者运动，生产工具的利用率和劳动利用率大大提高。去年春夏两季渔汛出海捕鱼的生产单位比上一年同期增加九百八十九个，冬季带鱼汛出海捕鱼的生产单位也比1955年同期增加二百多个。各地渔业社在各期渔汛中，积极进行技术改革，改变低产作业为高产作业，改良网具，推广先进经验等，对超额完成生产计划起了很大作用。
