Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from London: A mass meeting celebrating the 27th anniversary of the British Communist Party's organ, the "Worker's Daily," was held on the 10th at Albert Hall in London.

British Communist Party General Secretary Gollan delivered a speech at the mass meeting. In this speech, he once again demanded a general election and proposed the following demands as the current struggle program: "Increase wages, allowances, and pensions; resist all layoffs; strive for a shorter workday; stop rent increases; remove restrictions on trade between East and West; and secure British oil in the Middle East through peaceful negotiations." Gollan pointed out that the British ruling class is now attempting to "force the working class to pay the price for Suez, while attempting to attack trade unions by exploiting full and partial unemployment." The British working class is launching strike movements and an "eight million workers demand wage increases" movement to fight for their rights.

Gollan criticized British foreign policy. He pointed out that despite the failure of the aggression against Egypt and the current overly burdensome British military spending, the British ruling class still "stubbornly supports dirty colonial wars, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, war policies, and plans for preparing for atomic war." He criticized the government for sending Defense Minister Sandys to Washington to "beg for atomic weapons," and emphasized: "Turning Britain into a launch site for American missiles will not guarantee Britain's security. Only an immediate ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons can best defend our security."

Gollan also condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine." He pointed out that one of the aims of this doctrine is to replace British imperialism's position in the Middle East with the United States, and that all of this is happening at a time when "West Germany is attempting to use the so-called common market to establish its economic dominance over Europe."

Gollan said to the British working people: "Let us all demand an end to hydrogen bomb tests, a ban on nuclear weapons, and the immediate conclusion of an agreement on establishing a European security system, leading to the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the establishment of a reunified, neutral Germany. Let us demand immediate measures to stop colonial wars, especially to give Cyprus freedom."

"Worker's Daily" editor Campbell, in his speech, elaborated on the policy that the "Worker's Daily" should follow, and he demanded that the "Worker's Daily" unconditionally stand on the side of the socialist world in the struggle between imperialism and the socialist world.

    在庆祝英国“工人日报”创刊二十七周年群众大会上
    高兰要求举行大选并提出斗争纲领
    抨击英国外交政策和“艾森豪威尔主义”
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：10日在伦敦的艾伯特大厅举行了庆祝英国共产党机关报“工人日报”创刊二十七周年的群众大会。
    英国共产党总书记高兰在群众大会上发表了演说。他在这次演说中再一次要求举行大选，并且提出了下述要求，作为当前的斗争纲领：“增加工资、补助金和年金；抵制一切解雇；争取缩短工作日；制止房租上涨；取消东西方贸易的限制；通过和平谈判使英国得到中东的石油”。高兰指出，英国统治阶级现在企图“强使工人阶级为苏伊士付出代价，同时企图利用完全失业和部分失业向工会进攻”。而英国工人阶级正在展开罢工运动和展开“八百万工人要求增加工资”的运动来进行争取自己权利的斗争。
    高兰批评了英国的外交政策。他指出，尽管侵略埃及失败了，尽管目前的英国军事开支负担已经过于沉重，英国统治阶级仍旧“顽固地支持肮脏的殖民战争、北大西洋公约组织、战争政策和准备原子战争的计划”。他批评政府派国防大臣桑迪斯到华盛顿去“恳求给予原子武器”，并且着重指出：“把英国变为发射美国导弹的场所并不能保障英国的安全，只有立即禁止原子武器和氢武器才能最好地保卫我们的安全。”
    高兰还谴责了“艾森豪威尔主义”。他指出，这个主义的目的之一，就是要用美国来代替英国帝国主义在中东的地位，而这一切都发生在“西德企图利用所谓共同市场来建立自己对欧洲的经济统治”的时候。
    高兰向英国劳动人民说：“让我们大家一起来要求停止试验氢弹，禁止核子武器，立即缔结一项关于建立欧洲安全体系的协定，以导致所有外国军队撤退和建立一个重新统一的、中立的德国。让我们要求立即采取措施来停止殖民战争，特别是给予塞浦路斯以自由”。
    “工人日报”主编坎贝尔在发言中阐述了“工人日报”所应该遵循的方针，他要求“工人日报”在帝国主义同社会主义世界之间的斗争中无条件地站在社会主义世界方面。
