Xinhua News Agency, February 5th – Since 1950, agricultural experiment research institutions and agricultural colleges in major corn-producing areas have focused on hybrid breeding between corn varieties, and have achieved considerable success. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture requested that all major corn-producing areas vigorously promote inter-varietal hybrid corn, establish a hybrid corn breeding system, and that key agricultural experiment research institutions widely collect original corn variety materials to further strengthen hybrid breeding between corn inbred lines, in order to cultivate more high-yielding hybrid corn varieties for promotion and planting across the country.

In recent years, agricultural experiment research institutions and agricultural colleges in major corn-producing areas have successively selected many excellent inter-varietal hybrid corn varieties based on the cultivation requirements of different regions. Some of the hybrid corn varieties that have already been promoted have seen continuous expansion of their planting area due to significant yield increases. The "Fangza No. 2," "Fangza No. 4," "Qiyu No. 24," and "Qiyu No. 25" corn hybrids selected by the Shandong Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the "Laiza No. 7" and "Laiza No. 20" corn hybrids selected by the Laiyang Agricultural Experiment Station, all produced significantly higher yields than local varieties. Last year, this province organized seed breeding farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives to establish more than 150,000 mu of hybrid corn seed breeding bases, which can meet the needs of large-scale promotion this year. The "Chunza No. 1" hybrid corn variety selected by Beijing Agricultural University and the North China Academy of Agricultural Sciences has been demonstrated and compared in seventeen farms and agricultural cooperatives in central Hebei and Shanxi provinces for the past two years, resulting in a yield increase of 13.5% to 86.5% compared to local varieties, and the planting area is also increasing year by year. The "Shijiao No. 1" hybrid corn variety selected by the Hebei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, when planted in Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, and other places, yielded about 40% more than the "Huanong No. 2" improved corn variety. The "Baiza No. 1" and "Baiza No. 2" corn hybrids selected by the Baiquan Agricultural Experiment Station in Henan Province, when demonstrated and promoted in Huixian, Xinxiang, and other places, yielded 27% to 50% more than local improved corn varieties. The "Jinghui No. 50" hybrid corn variety selected by the Shaanxi Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station, when promoted in Jingyang, Wugong, Sanyuan, and other places, yielded more than 20% more than the local "Yellow Corn."

Agricultural experiment research institutions and agricultural colleges in various regions are also actively cultivating corn inbred lines and creating double-cross hybrids. Beijing Agricultural University has preliminarily selected a corn double-cross hybrid that yields 31.9% more than the "Huanong No. 1" improved corn variety. The "Chunza No. 5," "Chunza No. 6," and "Chunza No. 7" corn double-cross hybrids preliminarily selected by the North China Academy of Agricultural Sciences yield 12% to 20% more than the "Golden Queen" improved corn variety.

In addition, the Henan Agricultural College and the Luoyang Agricultural Experiment Station selected a new corn variety, "Hunxuan No. 1," from seventy-five corn single-cross hybrids in 1952 using a comprehensive selection method. After years of experimentation and demonstration, this new variety has yielded 26% to 80% more than local varieties and has been widely promoted in Luoyang, Shangqiu, and other places, with a planting area of over 200,000 mu.

    玉米杂交种增产显著
    农业部要求各地大力推广
    据新华社5日讯　在各个玉米主要产区的农业试验研究机关和农业院校，从1950年起有重点地开展玉米品种间杂交育种工作，到现在已经取得了不少的成绩。最近农业部要求各个玉米主要产区大力推广玉米品种间杂交种，建立玉米杂交种繁育制度；并且要求重点的农业试验研究机关广泛搜集玉米品种原始材料，进一步加强玉米自交系间杂交育种工作，以培育出更丰产的玉米杂交种，供各地推广种植。
    几年来，各个玉米主要产区的农业试验研究机关和农业院校根据不同地区的栽培要求，先后选育出很多优良的玉米品种间杂交种。一部分已经推广的玉米杂交种，由于增产显著，种植面积不断扩大。山东省农业科学研究所选育的“坊杂二号”、“坊杂四号”、“齐玉二十四号”、“齐玉二十五号”等，和莱阳农业试验站选育的“莱杂七号”、“莱杂二十号”等玉米杂交种，都比当地种显著增产。去年这个省组织种子繁殖农场和农业生产合作社建立玉米杂交种繁育基地十五万多亩，可以供今年大量推广的需要。北京农业大学和华北农业科学研究所选育的“春杂一号”玉米杂交种，近两年来在河北省和山西省中部的十七个农场、农业社示范对比的结果，比当地种增产13.5％—86.5％，种植面积也在逐年增加。河北省农业科学研究所选育的“石交一号”玉米杂交种，在石家庄、衡水等地种植的结果，比“华农二号”玉米良种增产40％左右。河南省百泉农业试验站选育的“百杂一号”、“百杂二号”玉米杂交种，在辉县、新乡等地示范推广的结果，比当地玉米良种增产27％—50％。陕西农业综合试验站选育的“泾惠五十号”玉米杂交种，在泾阳、武功、三原等地推广，比当地“黄玉米”增产20％以上。
    各地农业试验研究机关和农业院校还积极培育玉米自交系，创造双杂交种的工作。北京农业大学初步选育出一个玉米双杂交种，产量比“华农一号”玉米良种增产31.9％。华北农业科学研究所初步选育出的“春杂五号”、“春杂六号”、“春杂七号”等玉米双杂交种，比“金皇后”玉米良种增产12％—20％。
    此外，河南农学院和洛阳农业试验站在1952年从七十五个玉米单杂交种中，用综合选种法选育出了“混选一号”玉米新品种。经过多年试验示范，这个新品种比当地种增产26％—80％，已经在洛阳、商丘等地大量推广，种植面积达二十多万亩。
