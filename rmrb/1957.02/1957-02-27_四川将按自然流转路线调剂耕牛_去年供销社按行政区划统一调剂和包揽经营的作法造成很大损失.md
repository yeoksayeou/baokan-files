Xinhua News Agency, February 26th -- This year, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative will regulate over 109,000 head of draft cattle according to their natural circulation routes, more than double the total number of draft cattle regulated between various special districts in the province and purchased from outside the province last year.
    Various localities have improved this year's draft cattle regulation work based on the shortcomings in past work. In Sichuan Province, due to differences in soil quality and farming systems in different localities, the circulation of draft cattle has formed certain patterns over the years. For example, the draft cattle produced in the mountainous Dazhou Special District do not have strong pulling power and must be cultivated in the hilly areas of Nanchong Special District for one or two seasons before they can be transported to the Chengdu Plain and other places to be suitable. However, last year, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the method of unified regulation based on the surplus and deficiency of various places within the administrative region, and implemented exclusive management of draft cattle, violating the natural circulation route of draft cattle. In addition, cadres lacked appraisal skills and bought any cattle they saw, resulting in failure to meet the needs of the masses and causing a loss of one million yuan for the whole year.
    This year, Sichuan Province decided to adopt the policy of "organized regulation as the main focus, and direct management as a supplement." Local supply and marketing cooperatives will vigorously organize agricultural cooperatives to directly purchase from producing areas or transfer areas according to past practices, and also organize local original cattle dealers to engage in trafficking to invigorate the draft cattle market. Supply and marketing cooperatives generally do not directly engage in management. In order to help various localities do a good job in regulation, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has conducted a preliminary investigation into the possible supply volume in the draft cattle producing areas and major distribution markets this year, and provided it to the cattle-deficient areas for reference. It also plans to hold large-scale draft cattle exchange meetings in Yingshan, Qijiang, Guang'an and other three larger markets for various localities to go and purchase.

    四川将按自然流转路线调剂耕牛
    去年供销社按行政区划统一调剂和包揽经营的作法造成很大损失
    据新华社26日讯　四川省供销合作社今年将按照耕牛的自然流转路线，调剂耕牛十万九千多头，比去年全省各专区间调剂和从省外购进的耕牛总数多一倍。
    各地根据过去工作中的缺点改进了今年的耕牛调剂工作。四川省由于各地土质差异和耕作制度的不同，多年来耕牛的流转已经形成一定的规律。如山地达县专区所产的耕牛拉力不强，中间必须在南充专区丘陵区耕作一两季后，再运到川西平原等地才能适用。但是去年四川省供销社采用按行政区内各地余缺情况进行统一调剂的办法，对耕牛实行了包揽经营，违反了耕牛的自然流转路线；再加上干部缺乏鉴定技术，只是见牛就买，结果不能适应群众需要，造成全年亏损一百万元的损失。
    今年四川省决定采取“组织调剂为主，直接经营为辅”的方针，各地供销社将大力组织农业社按照过去的习惯到产区或转运区去直接采购，同时并组织各地原有的牛贩进行贩运，活跃耕牛市场，供销社一般不直接经营。为了帮助各地作好调剂工作，四川省供销社，对耕牛产区和主要集散市场今年可能的供应量，事先作了调查，提供给缺牛区参考，并准备在营山、綦江、广安等三个较大的市场，举办大型耕牛交流会，供各地前往采购。
