    Japanese Gunma Prefecture Police Headquarters
    Accuses US Military of Deliberate Murder of Japanese Farmer
    Over 150 Japanese Collecting Shell Casings Killed or Injured
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Gunma Prefecture Police Headquarters in Japan filed a complaint with the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office on the 9th, accusing US soldier Zellerd of "injury resulting in death" for killing Japanese farmer Sakai Naka.
    Sakai was shot and killed by Zellerd on January 30th while collecting empty shell casings at the US military training ground in Sōmagahara near Maebashi. According to Kyodo News, at approximately one hundred US military training grounds across Japan, over one hundred and fifty Japanese people have been killed or injured while collecting empty shell casings, including twenty-nine killed at the Sōmagahara training ground.
    According to Japanese newspapers, the police accuse Zellerd of deliberately scattering empty shell casings on the Sōmagahara training ground near Maebashi to lure Sakai to collect them. When she approached, the American soldier allegedly raised his gun and shot her. The head of the Gunma Police Headquarters stated that he could not agree with Zellerd's claim that he unintentionally hit Sakai while firing a warning shot, and he believed that Zellerd's shooting could not be considered as occurring "while on duty."
    The Japan Socialist Party announced yesterday that it would file a murder charge against Zellerd with the Maebashi District Public Prosecutor's Office on the 11th. According to the investigation statement by the Socialist Party's Special Committee on Military Base Countermeasures, the farmers in the Sōmagahara area collect shell casings from the training ground due to the poverty caused by the confiscation of their land by the US military authorities.
    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party also sent an investigation team to investigate the shooting of Sakai. Yesterday, however, it stated that Zellerd was "on duty" when he killed her, therefore Japan could not try the case, and it urged local residents not to get involved in the struggle against US military bases. However, it admitted that the occurrence of similar "unfortunate incidents" across Japan was "the result of the US military's lack of respect for people's lives and human rights."

### 日本群马县警察本部  控告美军故意杀害日本农妇  一百五十多名拾弹壳的日本人被打死打伤

    日本群马县警察本部
    控告美军故意杀害日本农妇
    一百五十多名拾弹壳的日本人被打死打伤
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本群马县警察本部9日向前桥地方检察厅控告杀害日本农妇坂井中的美国兵哲腊德“伤人致死”。
    坂井是1月30日在前桥附近的相马原美军演习场拾取空弹壳的时候被哲腊德开枪打死的。据共同社报道，在日本全国各地的一百个左右的美军演习场，已经有一百五十多名日本人因为拾取空弹壳被打死或者打伤，其中在相马原演习场被打死的有二十九人。
    据日本报纸报道，警察方面指责哲腊德故意把空弹壳散布在前桥附近的相马原演习场上，诱使坂井去拾取，当她走过去的时候，这个美国兵就举枪向她射击。群马警察本部部长说，他不能同意哲腊德所说他是在开枪警告时无意打中坂井的说法，他并且相信哲腊德的开枪射击不能被认为是“值勤”时发生的。
    日本社会党昨天宣布，它将在11日向前桥地方检察厅控告哲腊德杀人罪。据社会党军事基地对策特别委员会的调查声明说，相马原地区的农民去演习场拾取弹壳，是由于她们的土地被美军当局没收而带来的贫穷所致。
    执政的自由民主党也曾经派出一个调查团去调查枪杀坂井事件。它昨天却说，哲腊德杀人时是在“值勤”，因此日本不能审理这个案件，它并且要当地居民不要卷入反对美军基地的斗争中去。但是，它承认，日本全国各地发生同样的“不祥事件”是“美军不尊重人民的生命和人权的结果”。
