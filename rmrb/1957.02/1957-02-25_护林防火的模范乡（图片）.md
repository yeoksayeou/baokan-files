Model Township for Forest Fire Prevention

    Tumen Township is located deep in the Dabie Mountains of Henan Province. It has not had a single forest fire in the past four years and has been named a model township for forest fire prevention in the county. It is now a beautiful mountainous area with lush trees and evergreen fir and pine trees.

    Above: Burning field ridges is a major cause of forest fires. The members of the forest fire prevention brigade controlled the source of fire by using the method of "replacing burning with cutting." The cut weeds can also be used as fertilizer.

    Below: In order to expand forest protection propaganda and be vigilant against forest fires, the township has written eye-catching slogans in the villages and at the entrances to the mountains.

    护林防火的模范乡
    土门乡在河南省大别山区的深山里，四年来未发生过山林火灾，被评选为全县护林防火的模范乡。现在这里已成为一个树木蓊郁、杉松长绿的美丽的山区了。
    上　烧田埂是山林火灾的主要原因。护林防火大队的队员们用“以割代烧”的办法控制了火源。割下来的杂草还可以积肥。
    下　为了扩大护林宣传，警惕山林火灾，这个乡在村里和入山的路口都写上了醒目的标语。　　　　　　　　　李荣显、崔思岚摄
