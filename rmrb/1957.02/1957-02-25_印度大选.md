Indian General Election

    The second Indian general election began yesterday and will end on March 14. However, in three constituencies in Himachal Pradesh, due to heavy snow, voting will be delayed until May.

    According to the Indian Constitution, the Indian Parliament is the highest legislative body in the country, consisting of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) and the Lok Sabha (Lower House). The Republic of India is a federation, and the highest head of the federation is the President. The election of the President and Vice President is held after the general election, jointly elected by an electoral college composed of members of Parliament and members of the Legislative Assemblies of the provinces and states, with a term of five years. This general election will elect a new President and Vice President.

    Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by adult residents, with one member representing every 500,000 to 750,000 residents. The total number of members of the Lok Sabha shall not exceed 500, with an additional ten members appointed by the President.

    As for the members of the Rajya Sabha, they are produced by indirect elections, with a maximum number of no more than 250. Twelve of these are appointed by the President. The rest are produced by electoral colleges of the legislative assemblies of each province (state) proportionally. The methods of producing representatives from each province and state are also different. In some provinces and states, members elected by the state legislature are elected by proportional representation using the single transferable vote method. Some provinces and states also elect according to the method prescribed by special laws of Congress. One-third of the members of the Rajya Sabha are re-elected every two years. The seats of various parties in the Rajya Sabha are generally allocated according to the seats in the Lok Sabha. The President of India has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha, but cannot dissolve the Rajya Sabha.

    The Indian Constitution stipulates that the Vice President of India is the ex officio chairman of the Rajya Sabha, and only the Deputy Chairman is elected from among the members. The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha are both elected from among the members.

    Each province and state in India also establishes a state legislature. Many states have a Governor and two houses (Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly), while some states only have a Governor and one house (Legislative Assembly). The Governor is appointed by the President for a term of five years.

    According to the Indian Constitution, each province and state may establish one or two houses. If the Legislative Assembly of a state passes a resolution by a majority of all members, and it is approved by the Parliament, the Legislative Council can be abolished in states with Legislative Councils, and Legislative Councils can be established in states without Legislative Councils.

    The members of the State Legislative Council are produced by indirect elections, and the number of members cannot exceed one-quarter of the number of members of the State Legislative Assembly, and must be at least forty. One-third of the members are re-elected every two years, with a term of two years. The members of the State Legislative Assembly are directly elected by voters, with one representative elected for every 75,000 people, except in individual regions. The number of members of the State Legislative Assembly cannot exceed 500, and must be at least 60. The term of members is five years.

    According to the Indian Constitution, the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible only to the Lok Sabha, and financial bills can only be introduced by the Lok Sabha. The Rajya Sabha is also responsible to the Lok Sabha. Indian ministers must be members of either house; otherwise, they must resign if they are not members for six consecutive months.

    The total population of India is 382 million. In this election, there are 193 million voters. Voters will elect 494 members of the Lok Sabha and 2,906 members of the State Legislative Assemblies (another 196 members of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly were elected in 1955). There are a total of 2,518 constituencies in this election, with approximately 1.2 million polling stations nationwide. In addition to the four major parties—the Congress Party, the Communist Party, the Praja Socialist Party, and the People's Alliance—the parties participating in this election include the Scheduled Castes Federation, the Forward Bloc, the Hindu Mahasabha, the Jharkhand Party, the People's Democratic Front, the Democratic Alliance, the Tarai Sangh, the Indian Socialist Party, the Maharashtra Association, the Gujarat Association, and the United Front of Left-Wing Parties in Bengal, and dozens of other parties.

    印度大选
    印度第二届大选已在昨天开始举行，将在3月14日结束；但喜马偕尔邦有三个选区，由于大雪阻碍，要迟到5月间才开始投票。
    根据印度宪法的规定，印度的国会是国家最高的立法机关，它由联邦院（上议院）和人民院（下议院）组成。印度共和国是由联邦构成，联邦的最高元首是总统。总统和副总统的选举在大选后举行，由国会议员及各省邦的立法会议议员组成的选举委员会联合选出，任期五年。这次大选要选举新的总统和副总统。
    人民院的议员，由成年居民选出，每五十万至七十五万居民作为一个国会议员选区，产生一个议员。人民院的议员总数不得超过五百名，另有十名由总统指定。
    至于联邦院议员，他们是由间接选举产生的，人数最多不得超过二百五十名。其中十二名由总统指定。其余由各省（邦）立法会议的选举团体按比例产生。各省邦代表的产生方法也不相同，有些省邦是由邦立法院选出的议员按比例代表制，以单记名可转让投票法选举。有些省邦又依国会特别法律所规定的方式选举。联邦院的议员每二年改选三分之一。联邦院各党派议席大体按照人民院的议席分配。印度总统有权解散人民院，但不能解散联邦院。
    印度宪法规定，印度的副总统是联邦院的当然议长，只有副议长才由议员中选出。而人民院的正副议长都是由议员中选举的。
    印度各个省邦也设立邦议会，许多邦设有邦长和两院（立法院和立法会议），有些邦仅设邦长和一院（立法会议）。邦长由总统委任，任期五年。
    按印度宪法规定，各省邦可设立一院或二院。如果邦立法会议经全体议员大多数通过决议，并经国会批准就可以在设有立法院的各邦将立法院取消，也可以在不设立法院的各邦设立立法院。
    邦立法院的议员由间接选举产生，议员最多不能超过该邦立法会议人数的四分之一，最少不少于四十人。其中三分之一的议员到第二年即重选一次，任期二年。邦立法会议的议员，由选民直接选举产生，除个别地区外，每七万五千人选代表一人，邦立法会议的议员最多不能超过五百名，最少不能少于六十人。议员任期五年。
    根据印度宪法，部长会议只对人民院集体负责，财政法案也只能由人民院提出。联邦院也是对人民院负责。印度的部长必须是任何一院的议员，否则，如果连续六个月不是议员就必须辞职。
    印度全国人口有三亿八千二百万人。在本届选举中，选民有一亿九千三百万人。选民们将选出四百九十四名人民院议员和二千九百零六名邦立法会议的议员（另有安得拉邦立法会议的一百九十六名议员已经在1955年选出）。这次选举的选区共有二千五百十八个，全国约有一百二十多万个投票站。参加这次竞选的政党除了国大党、共产党、人民社会党和人民同盟四个主要政党外，还有表列种姓联盟、前进同盟、印度教大会、贾坎德党、人民民主阵线、民主同盟、太平会、印度社会党、马哈拉施特拉协会、古吉拉特协会、孟加拉左翼党派统一战线等数十个党派。
