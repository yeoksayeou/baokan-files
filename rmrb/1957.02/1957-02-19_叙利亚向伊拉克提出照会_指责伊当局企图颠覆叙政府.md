Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 18th – Syria has lodged a protest with Iraq, accusing the Iraqi government of plotting to "subvert the current constitutional government of Syria."

The Syrian government's protest, published on the 17th, also protested against Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said's recent speech in the Iraqi Senate. In this speech, Said attacked the Syrian government and expressed his hope for a rapid change in the current Syrian state system.

The protest pointed out that the Iraqi ruling clique participated in the anti-government conspiracy recently uncovered in Syria. The protest stated that during the ongoing trials regarding this case, the defendants have admitted "direct agreements with Iraqi officials" to launch a coup in Syria. These defendants also admitted that Iraqi authorities smuggled arms into Syria for use in launching a rebellion.

Syria's protest was submitted to the Iraqi government by Foreign Minister Bitar on the 13th through the Iraqi Ambassador to Syria. This protest is Syria's response to a protest lodged by Iraq. In its protest, Iraq protested against what the Iraqi government claimed were "Syrian actions interfering in Iraq's internal affairs" and "the heinous atrocities of blowing up Iraqi oil pipelines within Syria."
