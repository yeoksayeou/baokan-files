Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th Dispatch: Saudi Arabian King Saud said in a U.S. national television program on the 7th that the claim that Arab countries are "being seized by the Soviet Union" is "very erroneous propaganda," and the sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries is not threatened. He also believes that there is currently no danger of "Communist infiltration."

Saud also said that he considers Nasser to be an "Arab leader who defends his own country and all other Arab countries against aggression," and that the claim that Egypt and Syria might become "satellite states" of the Soviet Union is pure propaganda.

In discussing the relations between Arab countries and Israel, Saud said that if Israel abides by the United Nations resolutions, there would be no dispute between Arab countries and Israel. If the United Nations resolutions could be implemented on a fair basis, peace could be achieved.

At the same time, Saud reiterated that he considers Eisenhower's Middle East plan to be "desirable." He said he would discuss this plan with Egyptian President Nasser, Jordanian King Hussein, and Syrian President Kuwatly.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th Dispatch: The British Labour Party's left-wing "Tribune" weekly published an editorial on the 7th, commenting on Saudi Arabian King Saud's visit to the United States. The editorial said that the visit shows that the United States is trying to "trade cannons for the smiles of Arab leaders."

The editorial believes that the U.S. plan to ship arms to Saudi Arabia is "the first trick in implementing the Eisenhower Doctrine," and its purpose "is to ensure that the U.S. continues to have the right to use the Dhahran Air Base."

The editorial said: "We can now see the true face of the Eisenhower Doctrine. It is a reincarnation of the policy pursued by Britain in support of the Baghdad Pact..."

    沙特不信所谓“共产党渗入”的谎言
    但又再次替“艾森豪威尔主义”说好话
    英国“论坛”周刊抨击美国笼络沙特阿拉伯
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：沙特阿拉伯国王沙特7日在美国全国电视节目中说，所谓阿拉伯国家有“被苏联攫取”的说法是“非常谬误的宣传”，中东国家的主权并没有受到威胁。他还认为目前并不存在着“共产党渗入”的危险。
    沙特还说，他认为纳赛尔是一个“保卫自己国家和所有其他阿拉伯国家抵御侵略的阿拉伯领袖”，所谓埃及和叙利亚可能变成苏联的“卫星国”的说法完全是宣传。
    在谈到阿拉伯国家和以色列的关系时，沙特说，如果以色列遵守联合国的决议，阿拉伯国家同以色列就不会有什么争吵。如果能够在公正的基础上执行联合国的决议，那就有可能实现和平。
    同时，沙特重申，他认为艾森豪威尔的中东计划是“可取的”。他说，他将同埃及总统纳赛尔、约旦国王侯赛尼和叙利亚总统库阿特利讨论这个计划。
    据新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党左翼的“论坛”周刊7日发表社论，评论沙特阿拉伯国王沙特访问美国。社论说，这次访问表明，美国企图“用大炮换取阿拉伯领导人物们的笑容”。
    社论认为，美国打算向沙特阿拉伯运送军火是“实行艾森豪威尔主义的第一个巧着”，它的目的“在于保障美国继续有权使用扎赫兰空军基地”。
    社论说：“我们现在可以看清艾森豪威尔主义的真面目了。它是英国所执行的支持巴格达条约的那种政策的脱胎换骨……”。
