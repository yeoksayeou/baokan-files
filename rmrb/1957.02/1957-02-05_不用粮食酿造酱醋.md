    Making Soy Sauce and Vinegar Without Grain
    (Our Newspaper) News: The joint state-private Hengshun Soy Sauce and Vinegar Factory in Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu Province, in 1956, used soybean cakes to replace soybeans, wheat bran to replace flour, and broken rice to replace glutinous rice in the production of soy sauce and vinegar. Over the past year, it has saved more than 262,300 jin of grain, reduced the cost of soy sauce and vinegar, and also increased production and quality.
    In order to save grain, the joint state-private Hengshun Soy Sauce and Vinegar Factory decided to use substitutes for the main raw materials of soy sauce and vinegar, such as soybeans, flour, and glutinous rice, to produce soy sauce and vinegar. After many research and trial production efforts, it has been successful. This has not only saved a large amount of grain and increased production, but also made the brewed soy sauce and vinegar more delicious, fragrant, and nutritious. For example, in the past, every 100 jin of soybeans mixed with 60 jin of flour would produce 290 jin of soy paste; now, using 100 jin of soybean cake to replace 100 jin of soybeans, the original 60 jin of flour is reduced to 20 jin, and another 30 jin of wheat bran is mixed in, producing 360 jin of soy paste. The output is 24.14% higher than before.

    不用粮食酿造酱醋
    本报讯　江苏省镇江市公私合营恒顺酱醋厂，1956年利用豆饼代替黄豆、麸皮代替面粉、碎米代替糯米制造酱醋，一年来，节约了二十六万二千三百多斤粮食，降低了酱醋的成本，还提高了产量和质量。
    酱醋的主要原料黄豆、面粉、糯米等，公私合营恒顺酱醋厂为了节约粮食，决定采用代用品酿造酱醋，经过多次研究试制，已获成功，不仅节约了大量粮食，增加了产量，同时，酿造出来的酱醋味道更为鲜美香醇，富有营养。例如，过去每百斤黄豆，搅和六十斤面粉，产酱瓣二百九十斤；现在利用一百斤豆饼代替一百斤黄豆，将原来六十斤面粉减为二十斤，另搅和三十斤麸皮，产酱瓣三百六十斤，产量比以前提高了24.14％。
