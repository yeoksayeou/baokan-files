            Why Such a "Protest"?
                        Pi Yu
    Some time ago, when "Wenyi Bao" discussed the comic dialogue "Buying a Monkey" and the problem of satire in cartoons, many people mentioned that comic dialogues and cartoons often encounter undue and unreasonable interference in fulfilling their "instinctive responsibilities." After the film "Before the New Bureau Chief Arrives" was released, it also encountered accusations of distorting the image of demobilized soldiers.
    Things are indeed not unique: In November of last year, the Changchun Film Studio received an official letter with a large seal, but this was not a general administrative document, but a protest letter from the National Nurses Association. What exactly happened? Please see the protest letter: "We saw in the 19th issue of 'Dazhong Dianying' in 1956 that the Changchun Film Studio... again... has two medium-sized satirical comedy film screenplays, 'Banded Rose' (now named 'So Affectionate'—author), going into production... We believe that it is acceptable to educate and correct some bourgeois ideological consciousness remaining in a small number of women through films, but it is inappropriate to constantly attribute it to nurses... However, Changchun Film Company (as in the original—author) uses nurses as the protagonists of satirical comedies. This action is tantamount to adding insult to injury, further wrongly smearing nurses. Currently, various leading departments are actively studying and solving the problems of nurses... People's Daily once issued an editorial 'Respect Nurses' Noble Labor', but Changchun Film Studio is still producing films that distort the image of nurses. We believe this is very inappropriate, and therefore we lodge a serious protest and demand the immediate cessation of the production of the film 'Banded Rose'."
    Why protest? It is already clear here. The Changchun Film Studio has also rejected this "protest," and it was published in the first issue of "Dazhong Dianying" this year.
    "Banded Rose" satirizes a girl who only values clothes and not people, who looks for objects of affection, loving money and position, not the person. If a simple sentence were to summarize its theme, it would probably be "criticizing bourgeois viewpoints on love issues." From here, one cannot find traces of "distorting the image of nurses," cannot hear the echoes of "adding insult to injury," and cannot see the mortar of "wrongly smearing."
    Art must use the thoughts and actions of "people" to form dramatic plots, and film is especially no exception, and people always have their own social occupations. The scriptwriter of "Banded Rose" has the responsibility to find a profession for the protagonist of the film. Perhaps the scriptwriter could arrange the character to be unemployed or have an unclear profession. However, the audience will not agree, because this is not real. Therefore, if not a nurse, there will be another profession. People in any job position may have negative and backward aspects, and this aspect is often of universal significance and is non-professional. How can criticism of this specific character be considered a "distortion" of this profession?
    Perhaps some may say that the protest of the National Nurses Association was due to a misunderstanding. However, as far as I know, such unreasonable interference in artistic creation has become commonplace. It is said that the Changchun Film Studio originally planned to make the comic dialogue "Buying a Monkey" into a film, and even made preparations, but someone said that the commercial department does not have such a person as "Ma Daha," and the film plan had to be cancelled. This is really a helpless thing. Was not Tian Jinsheng, a junior high school graduate in "Summer Story" who was admitted to high school but did not continue his studies, criticized for not conforming to educational policies and asked to be revised? Such examples are indeed countless. No wonder recently a unit suggested changing the criticized numb cultural bureau in the newly filmed film "Ten O'Clock on National Day" to an unknown unit, so as not to cause dissatisfaction among cultural departments. Obviously, if the views of the National Nurses Association and the aforementioned people are agreed upon, then in all satirical works and comedies in the future, the most important "people" will be unemployed.

    为什么会有这样的“抗议”？
                辟玉
    前些时候，“文艺报”上讨论相声“买猴儿”和漫画的讽刺问题的时候，有许多人提到相声和漫画在履行自己的“本能职责”中，常常遇到不应有的无理干涉；影片“新局长到来之前”放映以后，也遇到据说是歪曲转业军人的形象的责难。
    事情真是无独有偶：去年11月里，长春电影制片厂收到了一件盖着大印的公函，可是，这却不是一般事务性的公文，而是中华护士学会总会的抗议书。到底发生了什么问题呢？请看抗议书：“在1956年十九期大众电影上看到了长春电影制片厂……又有……和‘带刺的玫瑰’（现名“如此多情”——作者）两部中型讽刺喜剧电影文学剧本下厂。……我们认为通过影片来教育和纠正一些遗留在少数妇女中的资产阶级思想意识是可以的，若常把它安在护士头上就很不妥当。……而长春影片公司（原文如此——作者）却把护士充当讽刺喜剧的主人翁，这种行动无异于落井投石，对护士再加一层错误的粉刷。目前各领导部门正在积极研究解决护士问题，……人民日报曾发出‘尊重护士的高尚劳动’的社论，而长影还在摄制歪曲护士形象的影片，我们认为是非常不恰当的，为此特提出严重抗议，要求立即停止‘带刺的玫瑰’一片的摄制。”
    为什么抗议？这里已经明明白白。长春电影制片厂也已经拒绝了这个“抗议”，刊载在今年第一期的“大众电影”上。
    “带刺的玫瑰”讽刺一个只重衣衫不重人的姑娘，她找寻对象，爱的是钱，是职位，而不是人。如果要找一句简单概括的话说明它的主题思想，那大概就是“批判在恋爱问题上的资产阶级观点”。从这里，是找不出“歪曲护士形象”的痕迹，听不见“落井投石”的回响，看不到“错误粉刷”的灰浆的。
    艺术必须通过“人”的思想、行动才能构成戏剧情节，电影尤其不能例外，而人总是有自己的社会职业的。“带刺的玫瑰”的剧作者有责任给影片的主人翁找到职业。也许剧作者可以把自己的人物安排成一个失业的或者职业不明的人。可是，观众不会同意的，因为这是不真实的。所以，不当护士，也会有别的职业。任何工作岗位上的人，都可能有消极的、落后的一面，而这一面，往往是有普遍意义的，非职业性的。对这个具体的人物的批评，怎么能认为是对这种职业的“歪曲”呢？
    也许有人可以说中华护士学会总会的抗议是出于误会。但是，据我所知，艺术创作中，碰到的这类无理干涉却已司空见惯了。据说，长春电影制片厂原来计划把相声“买猴儿”拍成电影，甚至作好了准备，但是有人说商业部门没有“马大哈”这样的人，影片的计划只得撤销。这真是无可奈何的事，“夏天的故事”里的初中毕业生田金生考上高中不升学，不是就被指责为不符合教育政策而要求修改吗？这样的例子的确是举不胜举。难怪最近有一个单位建议将新拍成的影片“国庆十点钟”中受到批判的麻痹的文化局改为不知名的单位，以免引起文化部门的不满。很明显，如果同意了中华护士学会总会和上述那些人的观点，那么今后在一切讽刺作品和喜剧中，最主要的“人”都会失业了。
