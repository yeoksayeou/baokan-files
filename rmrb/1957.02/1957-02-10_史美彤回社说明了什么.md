    Shi Meitong's Return to the Cooperative Indicates What
                Liu Baifeng
    Not long ago, the *New Hunan Daily* published an article titled "Why Did Shi Meitong Want to Join the Cooperative?" The general idea was: Last autumn, a farmer named Shi Meitong rejoined the cooperative after withdrawing from it for two years. It's not unusual for some farmers to rejoin the cooperative because their income from individual farming outside the cooperative is less than what they would earn in the cooperative. However, Shi Meitong's return to the cooperative was somewhat unusual, as he rejoined after his own land's yield per unit area was higher than the cooperative's. How did this happen?
    Shi Meitong, a farmer from Heping Township, Yongxing County, Hunan, joined the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in the winter of 1953. He had several acres of fertile land, and the Longtang Reservoir's water flowed right by his fields. He believed that his good land would suffer if mixed with other people's bad land, so he withdrew from the agricultural cooperative in the winter of 1954. When the Heping Agricultural Cooperative was upgraded to an advanced cooperative, some people encouraged him to join, but his reply was: "A good horse doesn't eat回头草 (tuítóucǎo, literally "return grass", idiomatically, "doesn't go back on a decision")!"
    Last year, his fields yielded 700 jin of rice per mu, which was 80 jin more than the average yield per mu of the agricultural cooperative, and 100 jin more than his own yield the previous year. His income was about the same as the income of ordinary cooperative members, and even more than some members. How did he achieve such a harvest? He knew best himself.
    Throughout the past year, Shi Meitong had many worries about production. After the seedlings were planted, there was no lime for the fields. The agricultural cooperative helped him solve the lime problem. Soon after, stem borers appeared in the fields. Shi Meitong rolled up his trousers and caught them in the fields for three days, but he still couldn't catch them all. Just when things were critical, the agricultural cooperative brought in large high-pressure sprayers and used "666" pesticide to kill the insects, and Shi Meitong's rice seedlings were saved. In July, a drought struck. It lasted for two or three months, and Shi Meitong's fields could no longer rely solely on the water from the Longtang Reservoir to fight the drought. The cooperative set up more than thirty waterwheels, with the head of one connected to the tail of the next, to bring water from three li away into the fields; while Shi Meitong spent every day enduring hardship to carry "搬家水 (bānjiā shuǐ, literally "moving house water", referring to transporting water over long distances)" to his fields, and the fields at higher elevations had to rely on carrying water to irrigate them. One small field at a high elevation was only able to save the seedlings by carrying a little water from the agricultural cooperative's fish pond. Throughout the year, lack of fertilizer, insect plagues, drought… the three disasters and six calamities educated Shi Meitong. He said with emotion: "This year, although I didn't join the cooperative, my fields really did; if it hadn't been for the cooperative's help, how could I have gotten such a harvest!" Therefore, as soon as the autumn harvest arrived, Shi Meitong handed his land certificate and application to join the cooperative to the management committee of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative, resolutely demanding to join the cooperative.
    This story is moving and thought-provoking. It vividly illustrates two questions: How should the superiority of the cooperative be measured? How should the cooperative treat farmers outside the cooperative?
    Last year, some agricultural cooperatives in some areas experienced reduced production due to natural disasters or shortcomings in their work, and a small number of members (mainly some relatively wealthy farmers) experienced a decrease in income. As a result, there was much discussion: some said that the cooperative had no superiority; some said that the cooperative was not as strong as individual farming. Some rural grassroots cadres and cooperative cadres even dared not promote the superiority of the cooperative to the masses any more. One of the important reasons why these people wavered was that they lacked a comprehensive and in-depth observation and a realistic analysis. The superiority of the cooperative cannot be mechanically compared solely based on yield figures for a certain period. Shi Meitong's field's yield per unit area exceeded that of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative last year. Can we say, based on this, that the collective operation of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative has no superiority, and that Shi Meitong's individual farming has superiority? Shi Meitong did not look at the problem that way. On the contrary, he fully understood that the reason his fertile land was able to produce more grain was the result of the agricultural cooperative's help. Everyone who truly respects the facts will not look at the problem that way. When evaluating the superiority of the cooperative, we must comprehensively analyze the specific conditions in all aspects, and we cannot just start from the yield figures for a certain period in general terms; we must base it on a large number of existing facts, and not on individual facts that are accidental.
    How should we treat farmers outside the cooperative, especially individual farmers who joined the cooperative and then withdrew? Some cooperative cadres and members have adopted a discriminatory and retaliatory attitude towards farmers outside the cooperative, labeling them as "backward" and "capitalist-minded," issuing them threats such as "now that you have withdrawn from the cooperative, you will never be allowed to join again," and infringing on their economic interests (for example, in order to make the cooperative's land contiguous, they exchanged bad land or distant land for their land). In this way, these individual farmers have become even more emotionally distant from socialism. The Heping Agricultural Cooperative, on the other hand, did not adopt such a wrong attitude towards Shi Meitong, a farmer who had withdrawn from the cooperative, but adopted an attitude of warm care and help. In the severe struggle against disasters, the Heping Agricultural Cooperative did not abandon Shi Meitong, who was farming individually outside the cooperative, and extended a hand of friendly assistance to him at every critical moment, helping him achieve a bumper harvest; and Shi Meitong finally returned to the cooperative. This fact once again tells us what the correct attitude is on the issue of treating farmers outside the cooperative.

    史美彤回社说明了什么
                刘柏枫
    新湖南报不久以前登了一篇题目叫“史美彤为何要入社”的文章。大意是说：去年秋季，一个名叫史美彤的农民在退社两年之后又回到合作社里来了。有些农民因为在社外单干收入比不上合作社而重新入社，这本来是没有什么奇怪的；但是，史美彤的回社却有些不平常，他是在自己的田的单位面积产量比合作社的还高的情况下重新入社的。这是怎么回事呢？
    湖南永兴县和平乡农民史美彤，是在1953年冬季参加和平农业社的。他有几亩肥沃的田，龙塘水库的水就在他的田边流过。他认为自己的好田同别人的坏田混在一起会吃亏，于是在1954年冬季退出了农业社。和平农业社转为高级社的时候，有人动员他入社，他的回答是：“好马不吃回头草！”
    去年，他的田每亩收了七百斤谷子，比农业社每亩平均产量多八十斤，比他自己前年的产量高一百斤。他的收入和农业社一般社员的收入不相上下，比有些社员甚至还要多。这样的收成是怎样得来的呢？他自己最清楚。
    去年一年里，史美彤在生产上是忧虑多端的。秧插下了，没有石灰下田，农业社帮助他解决了石灰的困难。不久，田里又起了钻心虫。史美彤扎起裤脚在田里捉了三天，还是捉不尽。正在危急的时候，农业社搬来了大型高压喷雾器，用“六六六”药剂杀虫，史美彤田里的禾苗才得救。7月间，旱灾又来了。一旱就是两三个月，史美彤的田光靠龙塘水库的水抗旱已经不济事了。合作社架起三十多架水车，车头接车尾地把三里外的水车进了田里；而史美彤每天却历尽千辛万苦往田里车“搬家水”，在高处的田就只好靠挑水灌溉。有一丘在高处的小田，还是靠从农业社的养鱼塘里车了一点水才把禾苗救活。这一年中，缺肥、虫灾、旱灾……，三灾六难教育了史美彤。他感慨地说：“这一年，我人虽没有入社，田可真是入社了；要是没有合作社的帮助，哪能得到这样的收成呢！”因此，一到秋收后，史美彤就把自己的土地证和入社申请书交给了和平农业社管委会，坚决要求入社。
    这个故事令人感动，也发人深思。它生动地说明了两个问题：应该怎样衡量合作社的优越性？合作社应该怎样对待社外农民？
    去年，有些地区的农业社，由于受了自然灾害或是办社工作中有缺点而减产了，有少数的社员（主要是一些比较富裕的农民）减少了一些收入。于是，议论纷纷：有的说，合作社没有优越性；有的说，合作社不如单干强。有的农村基层干部和社干部甚至不敢再向群众宣传合作社的优越性。这些人所以会发生动摇，重要原因之一就是他们缺乏全面深入的观察和实事求是的分析。合作社的优越性，不能机械地单纯从某一个时期的产量数字上来比较。史美彤的田去年的单位面积产量超过了和平农业社，我们能根据这一点就说和平农业社的集体经营没有优越性，而史美彤单干倒是有优越性吗？史美彤没有这样去看问题，相反，他完全懂得他的肥沃的田所以能够多产一点粮食，那是农业社帮助的结果。一切真正尊重事实的人也都不会这样去看问题。在评价合作社的优越性的时候，我们必须全面地分析各方面的具体条件，而不能只笼统地从某一个时期的产量数字出发；必须以大量存在的事实为根据，而不能以带偶然性的个别事实为根据。
    应该怎样对待社外农民，特别是入社后又退社的单干农民？有些社干部和社员对待社外农民采取了歧视、打击的态度，给他们扣上“落后”和“资本主义思想”的帽子，向他们发出“现在退社永远不许入社”的威吓，在经济上侵犯他们的利益（例如为了使社里的土地连片，就调换给他们坏地、远地）。这样，就使这些单干农民在感情上更远离社会主义了。和平农业社对待退社农民史美彤，却没有采取这样的错误态度，而是采取了热情关怀和帮助的态度。在严重的抗灾斗争中，和平农业社没有丢掉正在社外单干的史美彤，在每次危急的关头，向他伸出了友谊援助的手，帮助他得到了丰收；而史美彤也终于重新回到了合作社里来。这个事实又一次告诉了我们，在对待社外农民的问题上，究竟什么态度是正确的。
