Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 11th: The Indonesian Parliament's debate on the government's statement regarding the Sumatra incident has entered its final two days. Today's debate was extremely intense.

    Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit stated during the parliamentary debate today that because the Sastroamidjojo cabinet is standing on the side of the people in the current conflict between the Indonesian people and imperialist interests, the Indonesian Communist Party unhesitatingly supports the current government in suppressing the rebellion.

    He pointed out that the series of events in Sumatra was instigated by a small party and some illegal elements exploiting another large party, because they had failed in the general election and it was no longer possible to restore their position in the government through democratic means. These events are in accordance with the plans formulated by the US Pentagon.

    Aidit said that in resolving the North Sumatra issue, many people responded to the government's call, which led to the rapid downfall of Simbolon, proving that the government has prestige. He believes that if negotiations fail, the government should take decisive action against the "Wild Bull Council."

    In his speech, Aidit declared that the Indonesian Communist Party is willing to be friends with all parties and cooperate for a better future for the motherland and the people. Although the Masyumi Party has consistently opposed cooperation with the Communist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party will continue to fight for the establishment of a national coalition cabinet including the four major parties. He said that the Communists believe that internal divisions in Indonesia only benefit imperialism.

    Arudji Kartawinata of the Islamic League Party said that resolving the Sumatra issue should start from the political aspect, and he reiterated his party's proposal to reorganize the cabinet.

    Slamet Ginting, a member of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, called on the government to take a clearer attitude in resolving the Sumatra incident and to reward officers who are loyal to the government and respond to its call. He advocated dividing Sumatra into two provinces, East and West.

    K. Wedoyojo, a member of the Indonesian People's Unity Party, reminded the government to pay attention to the conspiracy activities of foreign embassies interfering in internal affairs. He called for the cancellation of the strike ban in South Sumatra and demanded the release of recently arrested trade union leaders.

    印度尼西亚国会辩论政府声明
    艾地主张支持现政府镇压叛乱
    并将继续争取建立包括四大政党的联合内阁
    据新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚国会就政府关于苏门答腊事件的声明所进行的辩论已进入最后两天。今天的辩论十分激烈。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地今天在国会辩论中发言说，由于在目前印度尼西亚人民和帝国主义利益的冲突中，沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁站在人民这边，因此，印度尼西亚共产党毫不犹豫地支持现政府以镇压叛乱。
    他指出，苏门答腊的一连串事件是由某个小党派和一些非法分子利用另一个大党煽动起来的，因为他们在大选中遭到失败，要通过民主道路来恢复他们在政府中的地位已经不可能。这些事件符合于美国五角大楼所制定的计划。
    艾地说，在解决北苏门答腊问题中，许多人响应政府的号召，使西姆波朗很快垮了台，这证明政府是有威信的。他认为，如果协商办法行不通，政府就应该对“雄牛师委员会”采取坚决行动。
    艾地在发言中声明，印度尼西亚共产党愿意同一切党派做朋友，为祖国和人民更好的前途而合作。虽然马斯友美党一直在反对同共产党合作，但印度尼西亚共产党仍将继续为建立包括四大党在内的民族联合内阁而斗争。他说，共产党人相信印度尼西亚内部的分裂只有利于帝国主义。
    伊斯兰联盟党的阿鲁季·卡答威纳答说，解决苏门答腊问题应该从政治方面着手，他重申他的党关于改组内阁的主张。
    印度尼西亚国民党议员斯拉梅特·京廷要求政府在解决苏门答腊事件中采取更明确的态度，并且奖励忠于政府、响应号召的军官。他主张把苏门答腊分为东、西两省。
    印度尼西亚贫民统一党议员克·韦多约提醒政府注意外国使馆干涉内政的阴谋活动。他要求取消南苏门答腊的禁止罢工令，并且要求释放最近被捕的工会领袖。
