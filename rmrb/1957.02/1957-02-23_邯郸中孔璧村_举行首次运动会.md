    Zhong Kongbi Village in Handan
    Holds First Sports Meet
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The farmers of Zhong Kongbi Village, Cishan Township, Kuangqu District, Handan City, Hebei Province, held men's and women's high jump, long jump, hand grenade throwing, and 50-meter prone unsupported shooting competitions on the 15th. This was the first time for the whole village, with thirty-seven athletes (thirty men and seven women, accounting for two-thirds of the village's total young and middle-aged population) participating.
    The competition lasted about five hours; although the weather was very cold and hands and feet were freezing, none of the athletes gave up, and their morale was full from beginning to end. The results of the competition: Zhao Guishan in the men's group achieved a high jump result of 1.26 meters, and Kong Qingzhi's hand grenade result was 44 meters, both reaching the Level 1 standard of the Labor and Defense System. Ma Wenyun and the young girl's shooting results reached the standard for ordinary shooters. Miao Qingmei, who won the first place in the women's high jump and hand grenade events, is only seventeen years old. She is not only an expert in the sports field, but also a labor model of the cooperative. (Wu Ting)

    邯郸中孔璧村
    举行首次运动会
    本报讯　河北省邯郸市矿区磁山乡中孔璧村的农民们，在15日举行了男、女跳高、跳远、手榴弹掷远和五十公尺卧姿无依托射击比赛。这是全村第一次，有三十七名运动员（男三十名女七名，占该村青壮年总数的三分之二）参加。
    比赛共约进行了五个小时；虽然天气很冷，冻的手脚发僵，但运动员没有一个弃权的，自始至终情绪饱满。比赛结果：男子组赵贵山的跳高成绩是一公尺二十六公分，孔庆之的手榴弹成绩是四十四公尺，都达到劳卫制一级标准。马文运和小姑娘的射击成绩达到了普通射手标准。获得女子组跳高和手榴弹第一名的苗清美，才十七岁。她不但是运动场上的能手，并且还是社的劳动模范。　（吴挺）
