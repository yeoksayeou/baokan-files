The development of translation was a characteristic feature of ancient Chinese scholarship and culture. From the Later Han Dynasty to the Song Dynasty, over a thousand years, Han and Tibetan scholars, in collaboration with Indian scholars, translated a vast number of Indian books. Furthermore, many ancestors of fraternal ethnic groups in Xinjiang (then belonging to the so-called "Western Regions") also made enormous contributions to absorbing and introducing ancient Indian culture, but their translations into their own languages have now been lost, leaving only scattered fragments.

Among these ancient translated Indian books, there were of course some literary works, most of which were Buddhist-related, but there were also some that were not. The Tibetan translations include many books that do not fall within the scope of Buddhist literature, such as the long lyrical poem "Cloud Messenger" by the great Indian poet Kalidasa. There are very few non-Buddhist documents translated into Chinese, but they are not non-existent. In the sixth century AD (during the Liang and Chen dynasties of the Northern and Southern Dynasties), the Indian scholar Paramārtha translated a "Golden Seventy Treatise," which is the most important classic of the "Samkhya" school of Indian philosophy. The original Sanskrit (ancient Indian) text of this book still exists, but the annotations and the Chinese annotations are somewhat different. Indian scholar Iyer Swamy once translated this book back into Sanskrit from the Chinese translation and published it in 1944.

One thing that makes us very interested in the Chinese translation of this "Golden Seventy Treatise" is that it contains Chinese translations of verses from the most famous classical "Rigveda" and the great epic "Mahabharata." This is probably the oldest translation of these two world classics. In the commentary on the first "偈" (gatha, meaning concise and meaningful song-like verses, which is the text of the book) of the "Golden Seventy Treatise," there is the following passage:

"The Four Vedas say: I once drank the taste of Soma and became immortal, entered the luminous heavens, and recognized the gods. What can those who resent me do to me now? What can the dead do to me?"

The "违陀" mentioned here is now generally translated as "Veda," which is the oldest classic in India, with a total of four parts, so they are collectively called the "Four Vedas." Among the four parts, the oldest and most important is the "Rigveda." These few sentences translated by Paramārtha are the third section of the forty-eighth poem in the eighth volume of the "Rigveda." The so-called "须摩" can be translated as "Soma wine," which is a type of alcoholic beverage made from plant juice that Indians drank and used for sacrifices to gods in ancient times. This poem is a eulogy to "Soma wine." The original poem has a total of fifteen sections. This section can be translated into such a four-line verse according to the original text (the original is one section with four lines, each line with a metrical pattern of eleven syllables):

"Having drunk the Soma wine, we become immortal,
Went to the bright heavens and saw the gods.
Now how can the enemies treat us?
How can those who cannot escape death harm us?"

The translation omits a vocative word "O immortal!" This is a reference to Soma wine.

There are a total of one hundred and twenty poems in the "Rigveda" praising Soma wine. The entire "Rigveda" has one thousand and seventeen poems, and if you also count the eleven later poems, there are one thousand and twenty-eight poems. The total number of verses is about 10,600, which, when divided into lines, is more than 40,000 lines. It has been calculated that the amount of the whole book is roughly equivalent to the sum of the two epics of the ancient Greek poet Homer. This is much larger in length than our Book of Songs.

The age of the "Rigveda" is an unresolved issue. Modern Indian scholar Tilak (who was also a leader of the national revolution, and India held a centennial commemoration of his birth last year) calculated based on the astronomical calendar materials (India's twenty-seven constellations, "lunar distance" and "vernal equinox", etc.) and believed that the "Vedic era" was in 6000 BC. At the same time, a German scholar, Jacobi, also calculated based on the same materials and believed that this era should be 4500 BC. The astonishing conclusions reached by these two scholars' independent research have not been accepted by scholars from various countries. However, their conclusions are not the most prominent. In 1921-1924, two other Indian scholars speculated that the "Vedic era" was in 16,000 BC and 25,000 BC based on astronomy and geology! Generally speaking, the "Rigveda" is a collection of works accumulated over a long period of time, and the compilation era is probably in the one thousand years BC, which is a more acceptable statement for historians. The materials related to Vedic mythology excavated in Asia Minor in 1907 belong to the fourteenth century BC, which can also be regarded as circumstantial evidence. Nowadays, scholars are gradually tending to comprehensively consider the development process of culture and not use single and isolated evidence for one-sided speculation, because no one can convince people who hold another kind of evidence with an isolated evidence.

The ancient Indian poems of three thousand years ago and the Chinese translation of one thousand four hundred years ago, when we talk about them now, on the one hand, we feel the closeness and long history of the Sino-Indian cultural relationship, but on the other hand, we cannot help but feel that there is still a lot to be done today, and our efforts are not as good as those of our predecessors. Our work in Sino-Indian cultural exchanges is far behind the requirements of the times.

    吠陀诗句的古代汉译
    金克木
    翻译事业的发达是我国古代学术文化的一个特点。从后汉到宋一千几百年间，汉族、藏族的学者在印度学者的合作下，译出了大量的印度书籍。此外还有新疆（当时属于所谓“西域”）的许多兄弟民族的祖先也在吸收和介绍印度古代文化方面有过巨大的贡献，不过他们翻译成自己语言的书现在已经失落，只剩下零篇断简了。
    古代翻译的这些印度书中，当然包括了一些文学作品，其中绝大部分是佛教方面的，可是也有佛教以外的。藏文译本中就有不少书并不属于佛教文献范围，例如印度大诗人迦梨陀娑的长篇抒情诗“云使”就是其中之一。汉译的佛教以外的文献很少，但也不是没有。公元六世纪（南北朝的梁、陈二代）印度学者真谛译出了一部“金七十论”，这就是印度哲学中“数论”派（“僧佉”派）的最重要的典籍。这部书的梵文（印度古文）的原本还在，不过注文和汉译的注文有些不同。印度学者艾雅斯瓦米先生曾经从汉译“还原”，把这部书又译成了梵文，在1944年出版。
    这部“金七十论”的汉译有一点使我们很感觉兴趣，这就是其中包含了印度最著名的古典“梨俱吠陀”和大史诗“摩呵婆罗多”的诗节的汉译。这恐怕要算是这两部世界古典名著的最古的译文了。在“金七十论”的第一“偈”（就是文约义丰的歌诀式的诗节，是书的本文。）的注释中有这样一段：
    “四违陀中说言：我昔饮须摩味故成不死，得入光天，识见诸天。是昔怨者于我复何所作？死者于我复何所能？”
    这里所说的“违陀”现在一般译作“吠陀”，是印度最古的经典，共有四部，所以统称为“四吠陀”。四部之中，最古而且最重要的一部是“梨俱吠陀”。真谛译的这几句就是“梨俱吠陀”的第八卷中第四十八首诗的第三节。所谓“须摩”，可以译作“苏摩酒”，是印度人在远古时期饮用和祭神用的一种植物汁做的酒类饮料。这首诗就是歌颂“苏摩酒”的。原诗一共十五节。这一节按照原文可以译成这样的四行诗节（原文是一节四句，每句十一音的格律）：
    “饮了苏摩酒，我们成为不死身，
    去到光明的天上，见到了天神。
    现在仇敌还能够把我们怎样？
    逃不过死亡的人怎能害我们？”
    译文中省略了一个呼格词“不死者啊！”这是对苏摩酒的称呼。
    “梨俱吠陀”中歌颂苏摩酒的诗一共有一百二十首。“梨俱吠陀”全书有一千零十七首诗，如果还算上比较晚出的十一首，就有一千零二十八首。诗节总数约有一万零六百节，分行算就在四万行以上。有人计算过，全书的分量大致相当于古希腊诗人荷马的两部史诗的总和。这比我们的诗经在篇幅上是大多了。
    “梨俱吠陀”的年代是一个未决的问题。近代印度学者蒂拉克（他同时是一位民族革命的领袖，去年印度举行过他的诞生一百周年纪念）曾根据其中的天文历法材料（印度的二十七宿、“月离”和“春分点”等等）推算，认为“吠陀年代”是在公元前六千年。同时有个德国学者雅可比也根据同样材料推算，认为这个年代应该是公元前四千五百年。这两位学者各自独立的研究所达到的惊人的结论并没有为各国学者所接受。不过他们的结论还不算是最突出的。到了1921—1924年还有两位印度学者根据天文学和地质学推测“吠陀年代”是在公元前一万六千年和二万五千年！一般说来，“梨俱吠陀”是一个长期间累积起来的作品集，编集年代大概是公元前一千几百年，这是历史家比较愿意接受的说法。1907年在小亚细亚发掘出来的和吠陀神话有关的材料属于公元前十四世纪，这也算是一个旁证。现在学者们已经逐渐倾向于从文化发展过程全面考虑而不用单文孤证去作片面推测了，因为没有人能用一个孤立的证据说服持有另一种证据的人。
    三千年前的印度古诗，一千四百年前的汉译，我们现在说起来，一方面固然感到中印文化关系的密切和悠久，可是另一方面也不能不感到今天要做的事还很多，而我们的努力还不及前人。我们在中印文化交流方面的工作跟时代要求比起来还差得不知多少呢。
