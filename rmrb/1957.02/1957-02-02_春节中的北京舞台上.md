　　Beijing Stage During the Spring Festival
            Our Reporter
    The Spring Festival in the capital has almost become a drama festival. Concerts, Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Quyi (Chinese folk art forms), spoken drama, new opera, Italian opera, Yue Opera, Sichuan Opera, Hebei Bangzi Opera, acrobatics, Shandong circus... all presented wonderful programs.

    At half past nine on the morning of the Spring Festival, the velvet curtain of the People's Theater slowly rose. The conductor's baton was raised, and the orchestra played the joyful "Festival Waltz." The concert of the Central Broadcasting Orchestra began. The radio then broadcast the bright chorus of young singers. The brisk and beautiful melody really made people want to sing and dance along.

    Beijing people like to call Peking Opera "Beijing's local opera." Since breaking certain "old rules," Peking Opera enthusiasts can once again see many excellent traditional plays. On the first night of the Lunar New Year, Shang Xiaoyun, one of the four famous female Peking Opera stars, performed "Jade Tiger Pendant" at the Guanghe Theater. The voice and figure of this sixty-year-old artist are still as good as ever. After Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Zhang Junqiu, and Qiu Shengrong collaborated in performances, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe became a very strong troupe. During the Spring Festival, they will perform more than a dozen new and old plays such as "Rouge Treasure Robe," "Beating the Stick Out of the Box," and "Wangjiang Pavilion." On the first night of the Lunar New Year, Ma Lianliang did not have a performance and spent time with his children and grandchildren at home. He said to the reporter on the phone: "In 1957, we must work hard to do three things: one is to sort out and perform more traditional plays; one is to do a good job in training young actors; and the other is to strive for more opportunities to perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers." He was very happy to go to the Western Suburbs Construction Workers' Club on the third night of the Lunar New Year to perform his masterpiece "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats" for the "heroes who are building the capital." On the first night, the China Peking Opera Theater performed "Niu Gao Seeks a Bride," starring Yuan Shihai. This play was formerly called "Flying Tiger Dream" and is a unique comedy. Yuan Shihai said: "Performing this play in the New Year brings good luck." Yuan Shihai had just returned from abroad and immediately plunged into the filming of the movie "The Gathering of Heroes" (in which he plays Cao Cao). The film studio gave him five days off for the Spring Festival, but he was unwilling to rest and wanted to perform for the audience in the capital.

    Many theaters outside Qianmen, Tianqiao, Xidan, Dongsi, and outside Chaoyangmen are staging Ping Opera. Ping Opera is a genre loved by the masses in Beijing. The Ping Opera circle has already made great achievements in the excavation and arrangement of traditional plays.

    At the Mass Theater on the first night, Xiao Baiyu Shuang and Xi Cailian performed "Peach Blossom Nunnery." "Liu Yun Beats His Mother," one of the programs performed by the Beijing Ping Opera Troupe during the Spring Festival, attracted countless audiences with its wonderful satire and rich, melodious singing. This play had been lost for about thirty years. Last year, it was dictated by old artists, and the Beijing Ping Opera Troupe reorganized it and reappeared it on the stage.

    The Chengdu Sichuan Opera Troupe traveled thousands of miles to Beijing for a tour. The play "Tan Ji'er" performed by this troupe has already won the praise of the literary and art circles in the capital.

    At the Tianqiao Theater, the Central Experimental Opera House performed "Spring Flowers Bloom" on the night, which is a new opera with the theme of various ideological struggles in rural areas on the eve of the upsurge of socialist cooperation. The famous opera "La Traviata" was performed during the day.

    This work by the great Italian opera composer Verdi is full of profound social significance and rich human touch. When people came out of the theater, some had tears in their eyes, and some sighed with profound meaning: "Too beautiful!"

    On the drama stage, two new and excellent plays, "Sharing Weal and Woe" and "Tiger Tally," began public performances on the first day. "Sharing Weal and Woe" was performed by the Central Academy of Drama Experimental Drama Troupe. This drama troupe is composed of a group of drama workers from all over the country. The director and actors are only in their thirties. Many of them also undertake teaching work at the Central Academy of Drama. In this performance, the young actress Liu Yanjin truthfully and movingly portrayed the brilliant image of a new socialist rural woman who grew up under the cultivation of the Party on the stage.

    "Tiger Tally" tells the story of Lord Xinling and Consort Ru Ji "stealing the tally to save Zhao" in the Warring States period. This beautiful and moving historical drama was written by Guo Moruo. It makes the audience deeply fall in love with a respectable historical figure and receive a vivid patriotic education. In recent years, the Beijing drama circle has attached great importance to learning from its own national drama heritage. Jiao Juyin, the director of "Tiger Tally," boldly absorbed some performance methods of the national opera tradition in the rehearsal, which was a very meaningful attempt.

    The work of the actors is very tense. When people are resting and celebrating festivals, they are redoubling their creative labor. Beijing people thank the Peking Opera, Ping Opera, Quyi, and drama actors who often perform in Beijing, and even more thank the Yue Opera, Sichuan Opera, and acrobatics actors who come to Beijing from other towns. They leave their hometowns to serve the audience in Beijing. How profound is this friendship?

    春节中的北京舞台上
            本报记者
    春节在首都几乎成了戏剧节。音乐会、京剧、评剧、曲艺、话剧、新歌剧、意大利歌剧、越剧、川剧、河北梆子、杂技、山东马戏……，都演出了精采的节目。
    春节早晨九点半，人民剧场的丝绒帷幕徐徐揭开。指挥棒举起，管弦乐奏出了欢乐的“节日圆舞曲”。中央广播乐团的音乐会开始了。广播电台随即把年青歌唱家们嘹亮的合唱传播出去。那轻快优美的旋律，真叫听了的人想要跟着唱起来，跳起来。
    北京人喜欢把京剧称为“北京的地方戏”。自从破除了某些“清规戒律”以来，京剧爱好者们重可看到许多优秀的传统剧目了。初一晚上，四大名旦之一的尚小云在广和剧场演出“玉虎坠”。这位六旬老艺人的嗓音身段，依然不减当年。马连良、谭富英、张君秋、裘盛戎合作演出以后，北京京剧团就成了阵容很坚强的一个京剧团。他们要在春节演出“胭脂宝褶”、“打棍出箱”、“望江亭”等新、老剧目十多个。初一晚上马连良没有戏，在家里和儿孙欢聚。在电话里对记者说：“在1957年，我们要努力做好三件事：一件是要整理、演出更多的传统剧目；一件是要做好培养青年演员的工作；还有一件是要争取更多的机会为工农兵演出。”他十分高兴初三晚上要到西郊建筑工人俱乐部为“建设首都的英雄们”演出自己的拿手好戏“借东风”。中国京剧院初一夜场由袁世海演出“牛皋招亲”。这出戏从前叫“飞虎梦”，是一出别具风格的喜剧。袁世海说：“新年演这出戏，有喜气”。袁世海刚从国外回来，就投入了影片“群英会”（他饰曹操）的摄制工作。春节电影制片厂放他五天假，但他不愿休息，要为首都的观众演出。
    前门外、天桥、西单、东四、朝阳门外等地的许多剧场在上演评剧。评剧在北京是受广大群众热爱的剧种。在挖掘和整理传统剧目方面，评剧界已经取得了很好的成绩。
    大众剧场初一晚场由筱白玉霜和喜彩莲演出“桃花庵”。北京市评剧团春节演出的节目之一——“刘云打母”，以它的绝妙的讽刺和丰富、动听的唱腔，吸引了无数观众。这出戏失传已经有三十年左右，去年由老艺人口述，北京市评剧团加以整理，重新出现在舞台上。
    成都市川剧团千里迢迢来到北京巡回演出。这个剧团演出的“谭记儿”，已经获得了首都文艺界的赞誉。
    在天桥剧场，中央实验歌剧院夜场演出“迎春花开了”，这是一个以社会主义合作化高潮前夕农村中各种思想斗争为题材的新歌剧。日场演出著名的歌剧“茶花女”。
    意大利伟大歌剧作曲家威尔第的这部作品充满深刻的社会意义和丰富的人情味。人们从剧场出来的时候，有的眼睛湿润了，有的意味深远地赞叹着：“太美了！”
    在话剧舞台上，初一这天开始公演两个新的优秀剧目：“同甘共苦”和“虎符”。“同甘共苦”由中央戏剧学院实验话剧院演出。这个话剧院是由来自各地的一群话剧工作者组成的，导演和演员只有三十几个人。他们中的许多人还担负着中央戏剧学院的教学工作。在这次演出中，青年演员刘燕瑾在舞台上真实、动人地塑造了一个在党的培养下成长起来的、社会主义农村新妇女的光辉形象。
    “虎符”写的是战国时代信陵君和如姬“窃符救赵”的故事。这部优美动人的历史剧是郭沫若写成的。它让观众深深地爱上了一位可敬的历史人物，受到了一次生动的爱国主义教育。北京话剧界近年来很重视向自己的民族戏剧遗产学习。“虎符”的总导演焦菊隐在排练中，大胆地吸收了民族戏曲传统的一些表演方法，是一次很有意义的尝试。
    演员的工作是很紧张的。当着人们休息、过节的时候，他们加倍地进行创造性的劳动。北京人感谢经常在北京演出的京剧、评剧、曲艺、话剧演员，更感谢从其他城镇到北京来的越剧、川剧、杂技演员。他们远离家乡到北京来为观众服务，这情谊该有多么深远呢？
