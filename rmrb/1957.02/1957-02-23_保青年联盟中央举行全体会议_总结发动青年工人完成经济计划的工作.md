Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 22nd: The Central Committee of the Dimitrov People's Youth League of Bulgaria held its ninth plenary session on the 18th, summarizing the work of mobilizing youth to struggle for the completion of the national economic plan since the Third Congress of the Youth League in May 1954. The meeting pointed out that in the past two years and nine months, 90% of young workers in the industrial, transportation and construction sectors of Bulgaria have participated in the socialist labor competition. At the initiative of various organizations of the Dimitrov People's Youth League of Bulgaria, 1,982 youth production teams, 87 youth workshops, 53 youth work areas, and 189 youth work shifts were established in these sectors; most of them have greatly overfulfilled their production plans.

The meeting also pointed out shortcomings in their work, such as the insufficient integration of political education and mass cultural work among young workers with production tasks, and insufficient concern for the lives and welfare of young workers. The meeting believes that the most important tasks of the Youth League organizations in these sectors in the future are: to attract every young worker to fight for improving labor productivity, reducing costs, improving quality, and practicing thrift; to carry out rationalization proposal movements among young workers, organize mass socialist labor competitions, and strive to complete the various targets of the 1957 national economic plan ahead of schedule.

    保青年联盟中央举行全体会议
    总结发动青年工人完成经济计划的工作
    据新华社索非亚22日电　保加利亚季米特洛夫人民青年联盟中央委员会18日召开了第九次全体会议，总结1954年5月青年联盟第三次代表大会以来发动青年为完成国民经济计划而斗争的工作。会议指出：最近两年零九个月中，在保加利亚工业、运输业和建筑业部门中，90％的青年工人都参加了社会主义劳动竞赛。根据保加利亚季米特洛夫人民青年联盟各个组织的倡议，这些部门里成立了一千九百八十二个青年生产队，八十七个青年车间，五十三个青年工区，一百八十九个青年工作班；其中大多数都大大超额完成了生产计划。
    会议也指出了它们工作中的缺点，如在青年工人中进行的政治教育和群众文化工作同生产任务结合得不够密切，对青年工人的生活福利关心不够等。会议认为，今后这些部门中青年联盟组织最主要的任务是：吸引每一个青年工人为提高劳动生产率、降低成本、提高质量、厉行节约而斗争，要在青年工人中开展合理化建议运动，组织群众性的社会主义劳动竞赛，争取提前完成1957年国民经济计划的各项指标。
