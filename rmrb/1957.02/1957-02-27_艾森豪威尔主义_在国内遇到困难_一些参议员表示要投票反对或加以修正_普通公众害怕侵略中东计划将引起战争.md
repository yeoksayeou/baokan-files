    Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: Many U.S. senators continue to express opposition to the government's proposed Eisenhower Middle East Plan.

    Senate Democratic Leader Johnson proposed a suggestion on the 25th, expressing the hope that the Senate could agree to limit debate on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and begin voting this week. However, this suggestion was opposed by Democratic Senator Morse, who said he saw no "urgency" in the Middle East resolution that would prevent full discussion. He also said he did not believe the government had any Middle East policy "except to protect oil."

    Democratic Senator Domeich said that "acting in good conscience," he could not "vote in favor of the proposal in its current form." He said: This proposal "is equivalent to an undated declaration of war—a blank check signed by Congress and then handed over to the President to fill in the date and location."

    Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, Democratic Senator Russell, said that he still opposed the passage of the proposal unless the clauses on providing economic "aid" and military "aid" to the Middle East were separated. Democratic Senator Magnuson also said that he would propose such an amendment and would support it.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: TASS, New York, February 25th: The "Daily News" published an editorial stating that Eisenhower's proposed massive military budget caused "unease and shock" throughout the country. The U.S. Congress has been receiving letters from many ordinary American citizens criticizing the government's military plans and opposing increased military spending.

    The newspaper pointed out that the American public primarily associates the current increase in military spending with the Eisenhower Doctrine. The newspaper also acknowledged that this doctrine is "particularly unpopular nationwide." The newspaper wrote: "It can be seen that many voters are afraid of this plan because it will not only spend a lot of money in the Middle East, but also may cause many American soldiers to bleed, just like in Korea in the past."

    “艾森豪威尔主义”在国内遇到困难
    一些参议员表示要投票反对或加以修正
    普通公众害怕侵略中东计划将引起战争
    据新华社26日讯　美国许多参议员继续表示反对政府关于艾森豪威尔中东计划的提案。
    参议院民主党领袖约翰逊在25日提出一个建议，表示希望参议院能够同意限制关于“艾森豪威尔主义”的辩论，在本星期就开始表决。但是，这个建议遭到民主党参议员莫尔斯的反对，莫尔斯说，他看不出中东问题的决议案有什么“紧急的地方”，以致于不能进行充分的讨论。他并且说，他不相信政府有什么中东政策，“除非就是要保护石油”。
    民主党参议员戴梅治说，“凭良心办事”，他不能“投票赞成现在这种形式的建议”。他说：这个提案“等于是一张没有注明日期的宣战书——一张空白支票，由国会签字，然后再交给总统，由他去填上日期地点”。
    参议院军事委员会主席、民主党参议员鲁塞尔说，他仍旧反对通过这个提案，除非把对中东提供经济“援助”和军事“援助”的条款分开。民主党参议员麦格纳逊也说，他将要提出这样的修正案，并且将支持这个修正案。
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社纽约25日讯：“每日新闻”发表的社论里说，艾森豪威尔所提出的庞大军费预算，引起了全国的“不安和惊骇”。美国国会不断收到许多美国普通公民寄来的信，他们批评政府这种军事计划，反对增加军费。
    报纸指出，美国公众把目前军费的增加，首先同艾森豪威尔主义联系起来。报纸也承认，这个主义“在全国特别不受欢迎”。这家报纸写道：“可以看出，许多选民害怕这个计划，因为它不仅要在中东花费大批经费，而且还可能使许多美国兵流血，正像过去在朝鲜一样。”
