Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd—In 1956, the total area of wasteland reclaimed nationwide reached over 30 million mu. This figure is close to the total area of wasteland reclaimed from 1953 to 1955.

Of the wasteland reclaimed in 1956, state-owned farms and land reclamation by migrants accounted for more than half of the total reclaimed area, with the remainder being reclaimed by agricultural production cooperatives and other production units in various localities.

In 1956, the provinces of Gansu, Yunnan, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region each reclaimed between 2 million mu and 6 million mu of wasteland. The provinces of Liaoning, Guangdong, and Hebei, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also reclaimed between 1 million mu and 1.8 million mu. Various crops were planted on most of the land reclaimed in these areas last year, and most yielded relatively good harvests. It is understood that residents who migrated to Heilongjiang Province to establish new villages achieved yields of over 4,000 jin per hectare for corn, about 2,500 jin per hectare for millet, and nearly 10,000 jin per hectare for potatoes on the newly reclaimed land, with a total grain output reaching 120,000 tons.

Last year, land reclamation work in various localities was carried out with strong support from the state. The wasteland reclaimed by state-owned farms and migrants, as well as the wasteland reclaimed by agricultural cooperatives in various localities, was mostly surveyed and designed before reclamation, and investigations were conducted on soil, natural conditions, and social economy. To ensure the quality and speed of wasteland reclamation, the state also purchased 500 tractors for residents who migrated to Heilongjiang. The machine reclamation capacity of state-owned farms has also increased compared to the past. At the same time, the state's investment in helping farmers carry out basic construction such as water conservancy on newly reclaimed wasteland is also very large.

China has about 1.5 billion mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed. From 1953 to 1955, the area of cultivated land in China increased by an average of over 11 million mu per year. With the development and needs of the national economy, the state will continue to organize wasteland reclamation work in a planned way in the future.

### 去年全国开垦荒地三千多万亩  新垦土地大部得到了好收成

    去年全国开垦荒地三千多万亩
    新垦土地大部得到了好收成
    新华社2日讯　1956年全国开垦荒地的总面积达三千多万亩。这个数字接近于从1953年到1955年全部开垦荒地面积的总和。
    在1956年开垦的荒地中，国营农场和移民开荒的面积占到整个开荒面积的一半以上，其余是各地农业生产合作社和其他生产单位开垦的。
    去年荒地开垦面积达到两百万亩到六百万亩的有甘肃、云南、吉林、黑龙江等四个省和内蒙古自治区。辽宁、广东、河北等省和新疆维吾尔自治区的开荒面积也都达到一百万亩到一百八十万亩。上述这些地区在去年开垦的大部分土地上种植了各种农作物，并且大部分都得到比较好的收成。据了解，移徙到黑龙江省建立新村的居民，在新开垦的土地上种的玉米每公顷产量在四千斤以上，谷子每公顷产量在两千五百斤左右，马铃薯每公顷产量近一万斤，粮食总产量达到十二万吨。
    去年各地的垦荒工作是在国家大力支持下进行的。国营农场和移民开垦的荒地以及各地农业社开垦的荒地，在开垦以前大都经过勘察设计和土壤、自然条件及社会经济的调查。为了保证开垦荒地的质量和速度，国家还为移徙到黑龙江去的居民购买了五百台拖拉机。国营农场的机器开荒能力也比以前增加。同时，国家用于帮助农民在新开垦荒地上进行水利等基本建设的投资也是很大的。
    我国可以开垦的荒地面积共有十五亿亩左右。从1953年到1955年，我国耕地面积平均每年增加一千一百多万亩。随着国民经济的发展和需要，今后国家将继续有计划地组织荒地开垦工作。
