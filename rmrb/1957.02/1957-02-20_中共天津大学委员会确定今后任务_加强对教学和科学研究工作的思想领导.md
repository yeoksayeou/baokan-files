Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 18th: The Chinese Communist Party's Tianjin University Committee recently decided to make strengthening ideological leadership in teaching and scientific research the central task of the Party organization in the future.

After extensively soliciting opinions from grassroots Party organizations, democratic party organizations within the school, and teachers, the Tianjin University Party Committee proposed that there should be no relaxation in the study of teaching work. Teaching leaders at all levels should adhere to a regular class-listening system to understand teaching and learning situations and summarize experiences in a timely manner. The school plans to gradually transfer experienced senior teachers to teach the basic theories of fundamental courses, technical foundation courses, and professional courses, and organize senior teachers to inspect the teaching process of these courses. At the same time, teachers are required to attach importance to cultivating students' practical skills in experimentation, practice, drafting, and engineering technology. In scientific research, the Party Committee proposed that practical research should be conducted based on specific conditions, and difficulties in the lack of instruments should be solved by means of self-made instruments and equipment, and the connection with production enterprises and scientific research institutions should be further strengthened.

Currently, the CCP Tianjin University Committee and the Party organizations of various departments have established special groups to study teaching and scientific research work, and will study and solve problems in teaching and scientific research in the future in coordination with administrative leadership. The Party Committee has also strengthened its ties with democratic party organizations in the school and holds regular joint meetings.
