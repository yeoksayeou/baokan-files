The International Bureau and the Special Committee for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations of the Japan Socialist Party announced yesterday after holding a joint meeting that the Japan Socialist Party had reached a consensus on the policy towards China. This meeting within the Japan Socialist Party was convened in preparation for sending a goodwill delegation to China. The leaders of the Japan Socialist Party decided on the 9th that this goodwill delegation will come to China in March this year. The delegation will exchange views with China on the basic principles of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and common issues related to Sino-Japanese relations and Asian international issues.

Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese opposition parties expressed disappointment with the policy speech delivered by the new Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi in the Diet today.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, questioned Nobusuke Kishi's speech at the plenary session of the House of Representatives, demanding that the new cabinet submit a new budget, abolish the law establishing the "Constitutional Investigation Committee," and dissolve the Diet.

In his reply, Nobusuke Kishi reiterated that he had no intention of dissolving the Diet at present and refused to submit a new budget. He also stated that he personally intended to revise the constitution and would use the "Constitutional Investigation Committee" to achieve the goal of revising the constitution.
