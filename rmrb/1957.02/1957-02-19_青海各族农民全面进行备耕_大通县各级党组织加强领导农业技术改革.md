    Qinghai's Farmers of All Nationalities Are Comprehensively Preparing for Spring Plowing
    Datong County Party Organizations at All Levels Strengthen Leadership in Agricultural Technology Reform
    (Reported by this newspaper) From the areas along the Yellow River and the Huangshui River to the alpine regions north of the Huangshui River in Qinghai Province, farmers of all nationalities from more than two thousand agricultural cooperatives are actively preparing for spring plowing, creating favorable conditions for striving for a bumper harvest this year.
    Farmers of all nationalities are driving livestock incessantly to deliver manure to the fields every day. During the Spring Festival, the Guangming and Hongxing agricultural cooperatives in Xunyang Township, Xunhua Salar Autonomous County, organized more than 300 cooperative members for six consecutive nights to deliver manure to the fields. In the four townships of Su Zhi, Xunyang, Qingshui, and Jiezhi, where sowing is the earliest in the county, 70% of the land in thirty-seven agricultural cooperatives has been fertilized. Agricultural cooperatives in various places are also carefully selecting seeds, using refined methods such as picking, winnowing, screening, and drying wheat, highland barley, and barley seeds, and then disinfecting them with Sairensan powder. Farmers in twenty-four townships in Ledu County, under the guidance of technical cadres from agricultural technology guidance stations and extension stations, have prepared seeds for 150,000 mu. Some places are actively repairing and adding farm tools. The six agricultural cooperatives in Hexi Township, Guide County, repaired more than 20 new-style walking plows, more than 300 back baskets, more than 10 harrows, and more than 300 saddles. In recent years, farmers of all nationalities in Ledu County have changed from broadcast sowing to row sowing, which has resulted in significant yield increases. This year, they have decided to further expand the area of row sowing and have prepared 250 seed drills for row sowing.
    Because there was relatively little rain and snow in these areas last autumn and winter, the soil is generally short of moisture. Many agricultural cooperatives are vigorously fighting drought during the spring plowing preparation, focusing on building small-scale water conservancy projects, crushing the soil, and accumulating water and ice. Farmers in Heichengzi Township, Hualong Hui Autonomous County, built a new canal that can irrigate 300 mu of land. Farmers in Qunke Township and Gandu Township winter-irrigated more than 7,900 mu, and at the same time repaired more than 240 large and small canals and leveled more than 7,900 mu of land in order to divert water for irrigation this spring.
    The focus of work of the leading organs in various rural areas of Qinghai Province has shifted to spring plowing preparation, strengthening specific leadership over spring plowing preparation work. Hualong Hui Autonomous County, Xunhua Salar Autonomous County, and Minyuan Hui Autonomous County convened cadre meetings in early February to focus on deploying spring plowing preparation work. The CPC Xunhua Salar Autonomous County Committee criticized the negative sentiments of some cadres who lacked enthusiasm for spring farming production at the three-level cadre meeting, enhancing the confidence and courage of cadres in leading this year's large-scale production.
    However, some areas in Qinghai Province do not pay enough attention to spring plowing preparation work, and some agricultural cooperatives lack production enthusiasm. They have done relatively poorly in accumulating fertilizer, preparing farm tools and seeds, and solving problems related to livestock fodder and feed. This situation urgently needs to be changed.
    (Xinhua News Agency) In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, the CPC Qinghai Province Datong County Committee has decided to strengthen the Party's leadership over agricultural technology reform. The specific measures are: Party organizations at all levels must focus on technology, adapting to local conditions and cooperative conditions, and combining new technologies with the production experience of the masses.
    Currently, the CPC Datong County Committee has designated a secretary to take charge of the leadership of agricultural technology reform. The county's eight agricultural technology extension stations have adopted a system of dividing areas and assigning responsibilities to specifically guide agricultural cooperatives technically. Nine agricultural cooperatives with different regions and different conditions have been selected as models, and are respectively overseen by the Production Cooperation Department of the CPC Datong County Committee and the agricultural technology extension stations, in order to gain experience and promote overall work. Agricultural technology extension stations are drafting plans to regularly impart technology to the agricultural cooperatives in their responsible areas. All 175 agricultural cooperatives in the county are also establishing and improving agricultural technology research groups, absorbing experienced elderly farmers to participate, so that the groups truly become the core of research and technology reform within the cooperative.
    The cultivated land in Datong County is generally divided into three categories: high mountain areas, low mountain areas, and river valley areas. Most agricultural cooperatives have all three types of land. Similar land is suitable for different crops and requires different farming methods due to differences in soil quality, temperature, sunlight, and wind direction. Last year, this county promoted some technological reforms on the basis of agricultural cooperation. Because it did not pay attention to adapting to local conditions, it caused grain production declines in some areas. Through summarizing last year's agricultural production work, the CPC Datong County Committee believes that strengthening the Party's leadership over agricultural technology and promoting necessary agricultural technology reforms are decisive factors in striving for a bumper harvest. Accepting last year's experiences and lessons, this year it is necessary to adapt to regional characteristics and combine with the masses' experience to carry out agricultural technology reform. In January this year, two county party secretaries led four work groups to the countryside to conduct detailed investigations and research in different regions. Then, the CPC Datong County Committee formulated specific plans for leading agricultural technology reform.

### 青海各族农民全面进行备耕  大通县各级党组织加强领导农业技术改革

    青海各族农民全面进行备耕
    大通县各级党组织加强领导农业技术改革
    本报讯　青海省从黄河、湟水沿岸地区到湟北高寒山区，两千多个农业社的各族农民，积极进行备耕活动，为争取今年大丰收创造有利条件。
    各族农民每天赶着牲口川流不息地向地里送粪土。循化撒拉族自治县循阳乡光明、红星两个农业社，春节的时候接连六个晚上，组织三百多个社员往地里送粪。全县下种最早的苏志、循阳、清水、街子四个乡三十七个农业社，已经在70％的地里上了粪。各地农业社还在仔细选种，经过拣、簸、筛净和晒干的小麦、青稞、大麦等种子，又用赛力散药粉赶拌消毒。乐都县二十四个乡的农民，在农业技术指导站和推广站的技术干部的指导下，准备好了十五万亩的种子。有的地方积极检修和添置农具。贵德县河西乡六个农业社修补新式步犁二十多部、背斗三百多个、耱子十多个、鞍子三百多个。乐都县各族农民这几年改撒播为条播，得到了显著的增产成绩，今年决定要进一步扩大条播面积，已经准备好条播用的耧摆二百五十架。
    这些地区去年秋冬雨雪比较稀少，土壤一般缺墒，不少农业社在备耕中大力和干旱作斗争，抓紧兴修小型水利、打碾土地和淤水背冰。化隆回族自治县黑城子乡农民新修一条渠道，可浇地三百亩。群科乡和甘都乡农民冬灌七千九百多亩，同时整修大、小渠道二百四十多条，平整土地七千九百多亩，以便今春引水灌溉。
    青海省农村各地领导机关的工作重心已经转向备耕方面，加强了对备耕工作的具体领导。化隆回族自治县、循化撒拉族自治县、亹源回族自治县，分别在2月初召开了干部会议，着重布置备耕工作。中共循化撒拉族自治县县委，在三级干部会上批判了某些干部对春耕生产劲头不足的消极情绪，增强了干部领导今年大生产的信心和勇气。
    但是，青海省有的地区对备耕工作还重视不够，一些农业社生产劲头不大，在积攒肥料，准备农具、种子，解决牲口饲草、饲料等方面，都做得比较差。这种情况亟待改变。
    新华社讯　为了争取今年农业大丰收，中共青海省大通县委员会决定加强党对农业技术改革的领导。具体办法是：各级党组织都要抓技术，因地、因社制宜，把新技术同群众的生产经验结合起来。
    现在，中共大通县委员会已经指定一位书记掌握农业技术改革的领导。全县八个农业技术推广站采取分片包干制，具体负责对农业社的技术指导。不同地区和不同条件的九个农业社被选作典型，分别由中共大通县委员会生产合作部和各农业技术推广站掌握，以取得经验，推动全盘工作。各农业技术推广站正在拟订定期对负责地区的农业社传授技术的计划。全县一百七十五个农业社也正在建立和健全农业技术研究小组，吸收有经验的老年农民参加，使小组真正成为社内研究和改革技术的核心。
    大通县的耕地一般分为高山区、低山区和川水区三类。大多数农业社兼有三类土地。同类土地又因土质、气温、阳光、风向的不同而适宜于不同的作物，要求不同的耕作方法。去年这个县在农业合作化的基础上推行一些技术改革，由于没有注意因地制宜，造成了某些地区的粮食减产。通过对去年农业生产工作的总结，中共大通县委员会认为，加强党对农业技术的领导，推行必要的农业技术改革，是争取丰收的决定性因素。接受去年的经验教训，今年必须适应地区特点和结合群众经验来开展农业技术改革。今年1月，两位县委书记带领四个工作组下乡，在不同地区作了详细的调查研究。然后，中共大通县委员会制定了领导农业技术改革的具体方案。
