After confirming that Adib Shishakli, the former dictator now in France, was guilty of jointly plotting this conspiracy, the military court sentenced him to life imprisonment with hard labor. Former cabinet member Munir al-Ajlani was found guilty of the same crime and sentenced to twenty-one years of hard labor.
