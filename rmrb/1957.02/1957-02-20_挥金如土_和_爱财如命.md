    "Spending Money Like Water" and "Loving Money Like Life"
    Qian Yin
    Recently, I read a jingle on the blackboard newspaper of the Ministry of Geology. Here are some excerpts:
    "Entering the Jinchuan Iron Mountain Team, stepping on RMB. Discarded in the mountain沟 are pipes, and flung beside the road are machines.
    "Next to the drilling rig are piles of snow-white wool felt, burned to warm the soles of your feet; and hundreds of pounds of fine wool on the mountainside, scattered like snowflakes in the north wind.
    "The stream flows gurgling, nothing here has a home. People argue red-faced for things, take the things and split up. Zhang San takes it for Li Si to use, if they can't divide it, they go to the warehouse to haggle.
    ..." After reading this jingle, people can clearly see a picture of spending money like water.
    In the old society, people who "spent money like water" were considered阔气 by some, and "loving money like life" was despised. However, in our country, in a society where social wealth is collectively owned, people who "spend money like water" and "love money like life" should be given new evaluations. In the attitude towards public property, people who "spend money like water" should be criticized, and people who "love money like life" should be praised.
    The example of the Jinchuan Iron Mountain Team is not an isolated phenomenon. According to statistics from the Ministry of Geology, one-third of the drilling rigs in the Ministry of Geology system are often sleeping in warehouses or in the wilderness. According to statistics from the Ministry of Geology, the geological system has the second largest number of cars in the country after the transportation sector. However, the Ministry of Geology has far more cars in need of major repairs or that are broken beyond repair than the transportation sector. In addition, machines are placed in the open air, the paint peels off and rusts; some wooden equipment has mushrooms growing on them for several generations. These phenomena are not isolated occurrences in geological exploration teams.
    Usually, when things break, the owner has to investigate the cause. How do the users of drilling equipment explain the reason? They say that because the task is urgent, the area is scattered, and operations are in the field, equipment maintenance is difficult. Who can say that this is not an objective fact, and who can say that this is not a reason? However, this is ultimately not a sufficient reason. Because using wool felt to start a fire should not be said to be unavoidable! When I contacted many comrades in the Ministry of Geology, they told me a major reason: many staff members in the geological system still lack a concept, which is the concept of thrift, the concept of "loving money like life."
    I think this does not need any explanation. People hope that the hard-working geological prospecting personnel will find a lot of treasures for the country, and they also hope that the geological prospecting personnel will cherish the country's assets, hope that they will not "spend money like water," and hope that they will "love money like life."

    “挥金如土”和“爱财如命”
    千音
    最近，在地质部机关的黑板报上读到了一则顺口溜。下面是其中的几段摘录：
    “进了镜铁山队，脚踏人民币。山沟里扔的是管材，马路旁边甩
    的是机器。
    “钻机旁边堆的雪白羊毛毡，用火燃起来烤脚底板；还有山腰里几百斤重的细羊毛，一阵北风刮得雪花似的满天散。
    “小河里流水哗啦啦，这里的东西没有家。要东西来吵红了脸，领来东西分了家。张三领来李四用，分不过来再上仓库去讨价。
    ……”读完这则顺口溜以后，人们可以清楚地看到一幅挥金如土的图画。
    在旧社会里，“挥金如土”的人是被某些人认为很阔气的，“爱财如命”是为人所不齿的。然而，在我们的国家里，在社会财富为集体所有的社会里，对“挥金如土”和“爱财如命”的人，就应当给予新的评价了。在对待公共财物的态度上，“挥金如土”的人应该受到批评，“爱财如命”的人就该受到表扬。
    镜铁山队的例子并不是个别现象。据地质部统计，地质部系统经常有三分之一的钻机在仓库或是荒野里睡觉。也据地质部统计，全国除了交通部门拥有数量最大的汽车以外，就要算地质部系统的汽车最多了。可是，地质部需要大修或坏的不成形的汽车却比交通部门多得多。此外，机器放在露天地，漆掉了生了红锈；一些木制器械上面长了好几代蘑菇等等现象，在地质勘探队也并不是个别现象。
    通常，东西坏了，物主总得要追追原因。钻探设备的使用者们是怎样说明原因的呢？他们说因为任务急，地区分散，在野外操作，设备维护工作有困难。谁能说这不是客观事实，谁又能说这不成其为理由呢？然而这终究不能算是充足的理由。因为用羊毛毡烤火，这总不应该说成是难免的吧！当我和地质部的许多同志接触的时候，他们却告诉我一条主要原因：地质系统的许多工作人员，至今还缺少一种观念，这种观念就是节约的观念，就是“爱财如命”的观念。
    我想，这是不需要作什么解释的。人们希望劳苦功高的地质勘察人员们给国家找到很多宝贝，也希望地质勘察人员们珍惜国家的资财，希望他们不要“挥金如土”，希望他们“爱财如命”。
