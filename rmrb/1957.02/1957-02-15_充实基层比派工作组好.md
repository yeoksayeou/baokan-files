Title: Strengthening the Grassroots is Better Than Sending Work Teams

　　I was originally a district-level cadre in Hanshou County, Hunan. Last November, in response to the Party's call to streamline county-level organizations and strengthen the grassroots, I was transferred to Jiangdong City Township to serve as the first secretary of the general branch. After being in the countryside for only two months, I have deeply realized that this measure of streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels is very correct.

　　We used to go to the countryside often. After the merging of districts and townships, I served as the leader of the work team sent by the county party committee to the grassroots, working in Jiangdong City Township for more than four months. But to be honest, the results of those four months of work were not as good as the results of the two months of work now. Why? Because of the different identities. Then I was a cadre sent down from above; now I am a member of the grassroots cadres. Different identities lead to very different ways of looking at and handling problems.

　　I feel that work teams sent to the countryside are often caught in a dilemma when dealing with problems: if they manage too much, they are afraid of taking over everything; if they manage too little, they worry about letting things drift. What to do? That is to only grasp some central issues and rarely manage specific problems. For example, when the township general branch holds a meeting, we only exchange some principled opinions with the general branch secretary beforehand, and rarely speak during or after the meeting. The county party committee often holds telephone conferences for work team leaders, and we always have to convey the spirit of the meeting through the general branch secretary. If the general branch secretary has not participated in the telephone conference, the transmission is often not comprehensive enough. Although these shortcomings are related to the fact that our work team did not do a good enough job, they also illustrate that simply sending work teams to the countryside has some weaknesses. These weaknesses can only be truly overcome when we participate in the leadership of grassroots organizations as grassroots cadres.

　　Now I am the general branch secretary of this township. The county party committee has entrusted the leadership responsibility of this township to me, so I have a strong sense of responsibility for every task. I often ponder until midnight, considering the various issues that a general branch secretary should consider. In order to solve the problems of the backward cooperatives in the Xiangtan area, I went to Xiangtan three times in one month (when I was the work team leader, I only went once in four months), especially to the cooperatives with more problems, where I worked for a few days to help them solve some problems. Now the county party committee's instructions are transmitted by me, and I can directly let them meet with the masses; I can also boldly and proactively handle daily problems. In short, settling down has changed our working methods, and our initiative and creativity in work have been strengthened more than before.

　　This is the benefit of sending cadres directly to the grassroots to participate in leadership work that I have personally experienced.

　　It should be explained that strengthening the grassroots and sending work teams are not the same thing. It is just that in the current situation where there are very few grassroots cadres and more cadres above, it is indeed better to transfer them to work at the grassroots level than to send work teams to help the grassroots work. When the leading cadres of grassroots organizations are strengthened, the higher levels still have the need to send work teams to the grassroots. This is because it is still beneficial for strengthening the connection between upper and lower levels and helping grassroots organizations improve their work.

### 充实基层比派工作组好

    充实基层比派工作组好
    高孟光
    我原是湖南汉寿县的区级干部。去年11月间，在党的精简县级机构，充实下层的号召下，被调到江东市乡担任了总支第一书记的职务。下乡才两个月，我已深深体会到精简上层充实下层这一措施是非常正确的。
    我们过去也常常下乡的。在撤区并乡以后，我担任过县委派到基层的工作组组长，在江东市乡工作过四个多月。但说实话，当时四个多月的工作成绩还不如现在两个月工作的成绩。为什么呢？因为身份不同，当时是上面派下去的干部的身份；现在则是基层干部一员的身份。身份不同，看问题、处理问题也大有不同。
    我感到工作组下乡在处理问题时往往左右为难：管得太多，害怕会包办代替；管得太少，又耽心会放任自流。怎么办呢？那就是只抓一些中心问题，很少去管具体问题。譬如说，乡总支开会，我们只在事先和总支书记交换些原则性意见，会中或会后，就很少发言。县委常常召开工作组长的电话会议，会议的精神我们总得通过总支书记来传达，总支书记没有参加电话会议，传达时往往不够全面。这些缺点虽然和我们工作组的工作作得不够好有关系，但也说明仅仅派工作组下乡是有些弱点的，而这些弱点只有当我们以基层干部的身份去参加基层组织的领导工作时才真正得到了克服。
    现在我是这个乡的总支书记。县委把这个乡的领导责任交给我了，于是我对每一件工作都不能没有强烈的责任感。我常常沉思到半夜，考虑到一个总支书记所应该考虑的各种问题。为了解决响滩地区落后社的问题，我在一个月中就到响滩去了三次（担任工作组长时，四个月只去了一次），特别到问题较多的社工作了几天，帮助他们解决了一些问题。现在县委的指示由我传达，我可以直接让它和群众见面；日常问题我也可以大胆地主动地加以处理了。总之，安家落户改变了我们的工作方法，工作的主动性创造性比以前都加强了。
    这就是我亲身体会到的派干部直接到基层参加领导工作的好处。
    应该说明，充实基层和派工作组并不是一回事。只是在目前这种基层干部很弱而上面干部较多的情况下，与其派工作组去帮助基层工作，确实不如调他们到基层工作更好。当基层组织的领导干部充实以后，上级仍然有派工作组到基层去的必要。因为这对加强上下级之间的联系，帮助基层组织改进工作仍然是有好处的。
