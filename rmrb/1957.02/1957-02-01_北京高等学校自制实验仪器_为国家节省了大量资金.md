Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Beijing's science and engineering universities, through the efforts of teachers, students, and technical workers, have manufactured many experimental instruments themselves.

    Lu Zhiqin, a technical worker at the Beijing University Physics Department's experimental factory, made a small universal testing machine for the Solid State Physics Teaching and Research Section, which greatly helped the scientific research of metal deformation and the establishment of relevant specializations within the department. An automatic high-temperature recording instrument used to measure temperature changes during metal smelting was also manufactured by this factory. Both instruments have become model products for related units.

    Various schools widely utilize waste materials and domestically produced materials to manufacture instruments. The anodic cutting machine made by the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics uses waste materials for everything except the motor and steel plate. A certain type of experimental apparatus urgently needed for teaching by the Teaching and Research Section 201 was imitated using domestic materials and made into eight sets, all of which were fully qualified. The ten "sextants" manufactured by the Physics Department of Beijing Normal University were also made using domestic materials. The Beijing University Physics Department's experimental factory also made more than fifty experimental instruments such as special electric furnaces and precision measuring instruments for the semiconductor physics specialization.

    Third-year students in the Mechanical Manufacturing Department of Tsinghua University urgently needed water pumps during their production internship last year. With the help of teachers and technicians from the internship factory, they overcame various difficulties and manufactured a batch of water pumps themselves. Not long ago, Tsinghua University produced three hundred water pumps and supplied them to more than ten units, including Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

    The manufacture of these experimental instruments has saved the country a large amount of money. According to statistics from Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Tsinghua University alone, more than 250,000 yuan has been saved.

    北京高等学校自制实验仪器
    为国家节省了大量资金
    新华社讯　北京的理工科各高等学校，师生和技术工人们自己动手制造了许多实验仪器。
    北京大学物理系实验工厂的技术工人吕志勤为固体物理教研室制成了小型万能试验机，对金属形变的科学研究以及对系内建立有关专门化帮助很大。一种用来测量在金属冶炼过程中的温度变化的自动高温纪录仪，也由这个工厂制成。这两种仪器已成为有关单位的模制品。
    各校广泛地利用废料和国产材料制造仪器。北京航空学院所制成的阳极切割机，除电机和钢板外，都是利用废料作成的。二○一教研室在教学上所急需的某项试验器，用国产材料仿照进口的仪器做成了八套，完全合格。北京师范大学物理系制造的十架“六分仪”，也是利用国产材料制成的。北京大学物理系实验工厂还为半导体物理专门化做成了特型电炉、精密测量器等五十多件实验仪器。
    清华大学机械制造系三年级的学生，去年在生产实习中急需水泵，他们在教师们和实习工厂技工们的帮助下，克服了各种困难，就自己制造了一批水泵。不久以前，清华大学生产了三百台水泵，还供应了鞍山钢铁公司等十多个单位。
    这些实验仪器的制成，为国家节约了大量资金。仅北京航空学院和清华大学两校的统计，就节约了二十五万多元。
