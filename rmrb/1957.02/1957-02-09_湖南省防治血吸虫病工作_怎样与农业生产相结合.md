    Hunan Province's schistosomiasis prevention and control work last year was carried out amidst intense rural production. The province eliminated snails from approximately 100,000 mu of land, treated more than 15,000 schistosomiasis patients, and completed prevention and control tasks at various stages. Facts have proven that prevention and control work can be closely integrated with production.

    However, schistosomiasis prevention and control work and production tasks have different specific content and requirements. We should fully utilize the consistent aspects of prevention and control work and production, and overcome and reduce the contradictory aspects between them, so that the two can be combined. Initially, the understanding of leading personnel and cadres at all levels was not clear enough on this issue. Party committees at all levels generally attached great importance to prevention and control work, but they were afraid of affecting production and the central tasks. They believed that as long as the prevention and control departments were solely responsible, without mobilizing all Party members and cadres to uniformly arrange and actively cooperate, it would not affect production and the prevention and control work could be done well. For example, in the work of investigating patients, some Party committees initially did not make unified arrangements, but instead let the prevention and control departments carry it out alone. After the cadres conducting the investigation went to the countryside, they did not receive the cooperation and support of township and commune cadres, the masses could not be mobilized, and the work progressed very slowly. As a result, not only could the investigation task not be completed, but it also brought a certain impact on production. However, many county Party committees placed the investigation work under the unified leadership of the Party committee. When the investigation team entered the township, they made the investigation the central task for two or three days, and the township and commune cadres actively cooperated to complete it in a concentrated effort, and then quickly turned to leading production. In this way, not only was the investigation task completed quickly, but also the production work was not affected. This shows that although prevention and control work has some contradictions with production in some aspects, the way to overcome and reduce these contradictions is not to let the schistosomiasis prevention and control department carry out the work alone, but to have the Party committee unify and lead it, and make reasonable arrangements. This is the key to Hunan's achievements in prevention and control work last year.

    At the beginning, the main problem in the thinking of township and commune cadres was that they did not understand the great significance of prevention and control work for developing production and protecting the people's health. After education, this situation changed. For example, when Shuangxi Township in Shimen County mobilized cadres and the masses to remove grass and eliminate snails in ditches and harbors, they used the method of calculating the accounts to get through the thinking of township and commune cadres. In this way, in three days, more than 390 people were mobilized, more than 130,000 dan of grass were removed for fertilizer, and snails were eliminated from approximately 20 mu of land.

    The problem with prevention and control work cadres is: although the technical personnel know the technology of prevention and control work, most of them come from the city or are students who have just graduated from school. They are not familiar with the rural situation and have little knowledge of agricultural production. Therefore, they cannot propose specific methods for how to combine prevention and control work with production. Sometimes, they are out of touch with reality and make some unrealistic and excessive demands, and do not pay enough attention to cherishing the farmers' labor, materials, and time. Although the inspectors are familiar with the rural situation and also have agricultural production knowledge, they were originally cadres engaged in central work and are accustomed to "grasping the center." They feel very awkward to carry out prevention and control work in conjunction with the central work. Some require the Party committee to grasp the schistosomiasis prevention and control work in the same way as grasping the central work, otherwise they say that the Party committee does not pay attention to it. Individual inspectors also used their past working relationships to directly assign tasks to township and commune cadres without the consent of the Party branch. On the other hand, many inspectors also lack technical knowledge of prevention and control work. Therefore, it is very important to help technical cadres become familiar with production knowledge and to help inspectors master technology.

    Relying on agricultural production cooperatives to incorporate prevention and control work into production plans and labor plans is also a very important issue. At present, the rural areas of Hunan Province have realized advanced cooperativization. Production and labor are uniformly planned and allocated by agricultural cooperatives. The agricultural cooperatives implement a system of remuneration according to labor, and labor work points have become the most important source of livelihood for farmers. If we do not rely on the agricultural cooperatives to uniformly plan and arrange, and want to use the methods before cooperativization to call on and mobilize farmers to use their labor to complete tasks, it will be very difficult. Therefore, prevention and control work must be incorporated into the production plans and labor plans of agricultural cooperatives. When formulating annual, quarterly, and monthly production plans and labor plans, each agricultural cooperative should consider the requirements of prevention and control work and incorporate it into a unified plan. For example, when formulating crop planting plans and land use plans, it is necessary to consider the elimination of snails and economic value, and consider cultivating and planting some epidemic fields, wasteland, and grassland with snail distribution, or take measures to change paddy fields into dry land where possible to eliminate snails in the paddy fields. When formulating fertilizer accumulation plans, it is necessary to consider the spirit of fully utilizing local fertilizers and reducing production costs, mobilize and organize cooperative members in a planned and led manner to remove grass in areas with snail distribution.

    In addition to incorporating prevention and control work into production plans and labor plans, the technical specifications of prevention and control work should also be combined with the operation specifications of production. For example, in the construction methods of water conservancy projects, whether it is repairing and building dikes and weirs, excavating, dredging, or blocking ditches and harbors, and building sluices, the engineering quality must adhere to the principles of thorough removal, thorough cleaning, deep burial, and compaction. These operating techniques are not only the requirements of water conservancy projects, but also the requirements of snail elimination work. Therefore, the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments should also include this work in the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy plans.

    After the prevention and control work is incorporated into the production plan and labor plan, the issue of labor remuneration and work point balance must be properly resolved. Since the prevention and control work is carried out in conjunction with production, the work points spent on general prevention and control work are actually production work points. However, prevention and control work also has certain special contents and requirements, so it is inevitable that some work will require more labor than simply engaging in production. Therefore, different methods must be adopted to deal with different situations. The first situation is that when prevention and control work is carried out in conjunction with production, it not only achieves the effect of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis, but also achieves the effect of production. For example, combining grass removal and fertilizer accumulation to eliminate snails, combining picking wild manure for excrement management, and combining fertilizer accumulation and preservation to build manure storage pits, etc. These production activities have not reduced economic benefits due to the combination of prevention and control work. In all such cases, it can be treated as agricultural work points, and remuneration is uniformly distributed in the total income of the entire cooperative. The second situation is that the production activities carried out in conjunction with prevention and control work fall within the scope of capital construction, such as farmland water conservancy construction carried out in conjunction with the elimination of snails, which requires more labor and has a longer period of benefit. If it is all distributed as general agricultural labor in the current year, it will not only relatively reduce the value of the labor day, but also such distribution is not very reasonable. In this case, it can be treated as capital construction, that is, the years of compensation for remuneration can be determined according to the benefit situation of the water conservancy project and the amount of labor spent, and the labor remuneration can be distributed year by year. The third situation is that the labor carried out in conjunction with prevention and control work has a certain production value, but it is smaller than the value of the labor day spent. For example, removing grass and accumulating fertilizer in ditches and harbors with snails has less production value than removing grass and accumulating fertilizer in general lawns, which is caused by the needs of snail elimination. In this case, the labor work points can be divided into two parts, one part directly creates production value, which is recorded as agricultural work points; the other part is required for prevention and control work, which is recorded as voluntary work, and is borne by all cooperative members on average at the end of the year distribution. The fourth situation is that the labor spent entirely for the needs of prevention and control work does not directly bring production value itself, such as snail elimination by burning and snail elimination by burying. In such cases, it can be treated as voluntary work, but attention should be paid to the appropriate balance of the burden between production teams to prevent excessive lightness or heaviness.

    Since prevention and control work is incorporated into the production plan and labor plan of agricultural cooperatives, it needs to be specifically arranged by each cooperative according to its different situation. For example, when to repair water conservancy, the snail elimination work must be combined with it, and when production is relatively idle, patients who have not lost their labor force should be sent for treatment. Therefore, within the scope of a county and a township, it is not possible to require a large concentration of labor at a unified time to carry out a unified activity. In this way, although it does not seem spectacular on the surface, the actual effect of prevention and control work is very good.

    Schistosomiasis prevention and control work is a relatively long-term work, and work must be arranged according to the changes in production seasons and natural conditions. Treatment work must also be tailored to local conditions, and the focus should be on areas where snails have been basically eliminated, appropriately strengthen the strength of cadres, complete the treatment tasks ahead of schedule, and compress the epidemic area. Of course, the treatment in general areas should also be appropriately strengthened.

    湖南省防治血吸虫病工作  怎样与农业生产相结合	华国锋
    湖南省去年的血吸虫病防治工作，是在农村紧张的生产中进行的。全省消灭了大约十万多亩面积的钉螺，另外，治疗血吸虫病人一万五千多人，完成了各个时期的防治任务。事实证明，防治工作是完全可以同生产紧密结合进行的。
    但是，血吸虫病的防治工作和生产任务毕竟有着不同的具体内容和要求，应当充分利用防治工作同生产一致的一面，克服和减少它同生产矛盾的一面，使两者结合起来。最初，在这个问题上，各级领导人员和干部的认识是不够明确的。各级党委一般对防治工作是很重视的，但害怕影响生产、影响中心工作，认为只要由防治部门单独负责就行了，不用发动全体党员和全体干部统一安排、积极配合，认为这样就不会影响生产，又能把防治工作搞好。如在调查病人的工作上，最初有的党委没有作统一的布置，而由防治部门单独进行。作调查的干部下乡后，得不到乡、社干部的配合和支持，群众发动不起来，工作进展很慢，结果不仅不能完成调查任务，而且也给生产带来了一定的影响。但是，也有不少县委把调查工作放在党委的统一领导之下，当调查组入乡后，就把调查作为两、三天内的中心任务，乡、社干部积极配合，突击完成，然后迅速转入领导生产。这样不仅调查任务完成很快，而且生产工作也没有受影响。这就说明，防治工作虽然在某些方面同生产有一些矛盾，但克服和减轻这些矛盾的办法，不是由血吸虫病防治部门单独进行工作，而是要由党委把它统一领导起来，加以合理安排。这是湖南去年防治工作取得成绩的关键。
    在乡、社干部的思想上，开始主要是不大了解防治工作对发展生产和保护人民身体健康的重大意义。经过教育，改变了这种情况。如石门县双溪乡在发动干部、群众在沟港内进行铲草灭螺的时候，用算账的办法，打通了乡、社干部的思想。这样，在三天内就发动了群众三百九十多人，铲草积肥十三万多担，消灭了大约二十多亩面积的钉螺。
    在防治工作干部方面的问题是：技术人员虽然知道防治工作的技术，但是他们大都来自城市或是刚出学校的学生，对农村情况不够熟悉，农业生产知识也少，因而对防治工作如何结合生产提不出具体办法，有时候还脱离实际，提出一些不切合实际的过高要求，对于爱惜农民的劳力、物力和时间注意不够。巡视员虽然熟悉农村情况，也有农业生产知识，但他们原来都是搞中心工作的干部，习惯于“抓中心”，对防治工作结合中心工作去进行，感到很不顺手，有的要求党委也像抓中心工作一样来抓血吸虫病防治工作，否则就说党委不重视。个别巡视员还利用自己过去的工作关系，不经党的支部同意，直接向乡、社干部布置任务。另一方面，不少巡视员也缺乏防治工作的技术知识。因此，切实帮助技术干部熟悉生产知识，帮助巡视员掌握技术，是十分重要的。
    依靠农业生产合作社，把防治工作纳入生产规划和劳动规划之内，也是一个很重要的问题。目前湖南省农村已经实现了高级合作化，生产和劳动力都是农业社统一计划，统一调配，农业社内实行按劳取酬的制度，劳动工分成为农民生活最主要的来源。如果不依靠农业社统一计划安排，想用合作化以前的办法，号召、动员农民用他们的劳动力来完成任务，那是十分困难的。因此，防治工作必须纳入农业社的生产规划和劳动规划。各个农业社在制定年度、季度、月度生产计划和劳动规划的时候，应当考虑到防治工作的要求，把它统一规划进去。如在制定作物种植计划和土地利用计划的时候，就要根据灭螺需要和经济价值，考虑把一些有钉螺分布的疫田、荒地、草滩等加以开垦种植，或在可能情况下采取水地改旱地的办法，消灭水田中的钉螺。在制定积肥计划的时候，就要根据充分利用土肥料、降低生产成本的精神，考虑到灭螺的需要，发动和组织社员，有计划有领导地在有钉螺分布的地方进行铲草。
    除了把防治工作纳入生产计划和劳动规划之外，还应当把防治工作的技术规格和生产的操作规格结合起来。如在水利工程的施工方法上，无论是培修、兴修大堤、渍堤，开挖、疏导或堵塞沟港，以及建闸等工程，在工程质量上要坚持作到铲光、扫净、深埋、夯紧。这些操作技术，不仅是水利工程的要求，也是灭螺工作的要求。因此，农林、水利部门也应该把这项工作列入农林、水利规划中去。
    防治工作纳入了生产规划和劳动规划之后，必须妥善解决劳动报酬和工分平衡的问题。由于防治工作是和生产统一进行的，所以一般防治工作所花的工分，实际上也就是生产的工分。但是防治工作也有一定的特殊内容和要求，因此在某些工作上比较单纯搞生产要多花一些人工，也是难免的。因此，必须分别不同的情况，采取不同的办法来处理。第一种情况是，结合生产进行防治工作时，既收到了防治血吸虫病的效果，也收到了生产的效果。如结合铲草积肥消灭钉螺，结合拣野粪进行粪便管理，结合积肥保肥修建储粪池，等等。这些生产活动并未因为结合防治工作而降低经济效益。凡属这种情况，即可作为农业工分处理，在全社总收入中统一分配报酬。第二种情况是，结合防治工作所进行的生产活动属于基本建设的范围，如由结合消灭钉螺所进行的农田水利建设，花工较多，而且受益的年限也较长，如果都作为一般农业劳动在当年分配报酬，不但相对地减低了劳动日的价值，而且这样分配也是不太合理的。对于这种情况，就可作为基本建设处理，即根据水利工程受益情况和花工多少，确定偿付报酬的年限，逐年分配劳动报酬。第三种情况是，结合防治工作所进行的劳动，虽有一定的生产价值，但是较所花劳动日价值为小，如在有钉螺的沟港进行铲草积肥，就比在一般草坪铲草积肥的生产价值要少，这是由于灭螺的需要而引起的。在这种情况下，可把劳动工分分为两部分，一部分是直接创造了生产价值的，便记作农业工分；一部分是为防治工作所需要的，便记作义务工，年终分配的时候，由全体社员平均负担。第四种情况是，完全为了防治工作的需要而花去的劳动力，本身并未直接带来生产价值，如火烧灭螺、土埋钉螺等。对这样的情况，可作义务工处理，但应注意各生产队之间的负担适当平衡，防止畸轻畸重。
    由于防治工作纳入了农业社的生产计划和劳动规划，这就需要由各社根据自己的不同情况来具体安排，如什么时候修水利，就要使灭螺工作结合进行，什么时候生产比较空闲，就把还没有丧失劳动力的病人送去治疗。因此，在一县一乡的范围内，不能要求在统一的时间内大量集中劳动力进行统一的某种活动。这样，虽然表面上并不轰轰烈烈，但防治工作的实际效果是很好的。
    防治血吸虫病工作是一个比较长时期的工作，必须根据生产季节和自然情况的变化，因时制宜地来安排工作。治疗工作也必须作到因地制宜，重点应放在那些已基本消灭钉螺的地方，适当加强干部力量，提前完成治疗任务，压缩疫区。当然对一般地区的治疗也应当适当加强。
