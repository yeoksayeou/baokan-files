    Moscow Construction Workers Launch Production Competition
    (Our Moscow Dispatch) To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Moscow construction workers will build an additional 900,000 square meters of residential housing, 60 school buildings, and dozens of hospitals and theaters this year.
    High-rise buildings scheduled for completion this year include the "Ukraine" Grand Hotel, the "Children's World" department store, and the new Moscow Film Studio. Construction on a series of houses and facilities for the 6th World Youth Festival will also begin on a large scale. The southwestern district of Moscow is an important area for housing construction this year, where a total of 400,000 square meters of housing will be built throughout the year.
    Currently, in order to strive for the early completion of this year's production plan, construction workers have launched a heated socialist production competition. The competition focuses particularly on reducing costs and accelerating construction speed, widely adopting advanced construction technologies, and gradually promoting the use of structural housing construction methods that are both economical and fast.

    莫斯科建筑工人展开生产竞赛
    本报莫斯科31日电　莫斯科的建筑工人在今年将多盖起九十万平方公尺的居住房屋，六十个学校校舍，几十个医院、剧院，作为纪念十月革命四十周年。
    年内建筑竣工的高层大厦将有“乌克兰”大旅馆，“儿童世界”百货商店，新的莫斯科电影制片厂，并开始大批建筑供第六届世界青年联欢节使用的一系列房屋和设备。莫斯科的西南区是今年建筑房屋的重要地区，那里全年将集中建起四十万平方公尺的住房。
    目前，为了争取提前完成今年生产计划，建筑工人们已展开了热烈的社会主义生产竞赛。竞赛中特别注意到了降低成本和加快建筑速度，广泛地采用先进建筑技术，并将逐步地推广采用既省又快的结构式房屋建筑方法。
