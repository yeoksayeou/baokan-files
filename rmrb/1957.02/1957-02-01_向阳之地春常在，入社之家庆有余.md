Where the Sun Shines, Spring Abides; Homes of Cooperatives Overflow with Celebration

First Time in Sixty Years to Have Such a High Income

The income distribution work of the Baoshan Agricultural Cooperative in Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, has concluded. Lü Qingshan's family, the cooperative members with the highest income, received a total of more than 1,500 yuan. Lü Qingshan, who is sixty-one years old, said with emotion, "This is the first time in my life that I've seen so much colorful money." His family of eight has made new clothes for almost everyone since winter. Recently, his family has been buying things to celebrate the Spring Festival joyfully.

When Lü Qingshan was young, his family was very poor. In winter, he didn't even have a pair of cotton shoes. When it got too cold to bear, he would sometimes stick his feet into a pile of freshly discharged hot cow dung to warm them. Later, Lü Qingshan drove a cart between Suihua and Harbin, transporting goods for others, saved some money, and bought some land and two horses. By the time of the land reform, Lü Qingshan was already a lower-middle peasant. However, his family's life did not change much. Whenever the old Lunar New Year approached, when people came to demand debts, Lü Qingshan's wife was always ashamed and didn't know what to say.

After the land reform, Lü Qingshan's family, together with the land they were allocated, had more than eight hectares of land, and including the foals born to the mares, they also had four draught horses. With three male laborers and two female laborers, they were also a hardworking family. Relying on strong people, strong horses, and a lot of land, Lü Qingshan farmed independently until 1954. During this period, there were years of poor harvests and years of good harvests. Every year, the family worked non-stop from beginning to end, and although they harvested more than 10,000 jin of grain, after deducting the feed for the four horses, the rations for eight people, and the seeds and production investment for the following year, there was not much left.

In the winter of 1954, Lü Qingshan's family joined the agricultural cooperative. The results of their work in 1955 were that the family received enough rations and firewood, paid off the debts accumulated over the years, and still had more than 200 yuan in cash left. At this time, Lü Qingshan regretted his previous concerns and not joining the cooperative earlier.

At the end of 1955, he joined the advanced cooperative with two small foals. In 1956, the cooperative took advantage of the superior conditions of unified management and adopted a series of agricultural production increase measures, so the average grain yield per hectare increased by about 50% compared with the previous year. Including sideline income, the remuneration for each labor day reached more than two yuan. Lü Qingshan's family had more laborers than most in the cooperative, often keeping five laborers participating in the cooperative's production, and doing a total of more than 720 labor days a year.

Richer Year by Year

Shen Caiming, a member of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Ruifeng Township, Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province, has three laborers in his family. Last year, they did more than 600 labor days in total, with a net income of more than 1,030 yuan, more than double that of 1955. In addition, his family's sideline income from raising pigs and sheep was more than 70 yuan.

Prior to this, Shen Caiming's family had never had such a high income. Fifteen years ago, Shen Caiming and his wife wandered from a foreign land to Ruifeng Township, renting a few mu of land to farm. Recalling the past, he exclaimed, "At that time, we didn't have an inch of land." After liberation, his family was allocated land in the land reform. Although life was much better, individual farming was difficult, and they still did not escape poverty.

After the autumn harvest in 1954, the Qianjin Village where Shen Caiming lived organized an agricultural cooperative, and Shen Caiming was the first to sign up and join the cooperative. The following year, the cooperative increased production, and his family's income was more than 400 yuan, more than double that of the year before joining the cooperative. He used more than 200 yuan for family living expenses, and the rest of the money was used to pay off past debts, and he bought six pieces of wood, planning to build a new house when he encountered another good year.

Last year, Shen Caiming's family's income increased more than doubled compared with 1955, which fundamentally changed his family's economic life. The whole family of seven received more than 5,000 jin of grain, mainly rice, and ate two meals of dry food and one meal of porridge every day. Both beds in his house were covered with new flowered quilts, and adults and children all had new cotton clothes. His wife, Chen Hongmei, told me, "My little girl is wearing a flowered plaid cotton coat. The eldest son is young and likes to be pretty, so he made a striped woolen cotton coat. Shen Caiming is old and doesn't care, so I made him a set of durable black cotton clothes." As she was talking to me, she was still sewing new underwear for her husband.

With a better life, Shen Caiming sent his third son to elementary school. He said that his third son was the first literate person in the Shen family in recent generations. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Zhesheng)

A Happy Family of a Mongolian

The winter Basha grassland was covered in silver clothes. Braving the biting cold wind, I came to the home of Batu Bayar of the Mongolian battalion of Wutai (in Hebei Province) on the grassland.

Entering Batu Bayar's house, Yinzhen and her mother-in-law were humming a moving Mongolian song while boiling milk tea. When they saw me, they seemed to see a friend they had not seen for a long time, and shook hands with me and let me warm myself by the fire. As we were talking and laughing warmly, Batu Bayar entered the house. After greeting me, he asked his partner Xiaoshun Gadan to bring me milk tea to drink.

As we drank the white milk tea, we chatted and talked about the living conditions of the herdsmen. Batu Bayar excitedly smiled at me and said: "Advanced cooperativization has brought happiness to us Mongolians. In 1956, all twenty Mongolian households in our village increased their income. Take my family as an example. In 1955, when farming independently, the total income from agriculture and animal husbandry was ninety-six yuan. In 1956, after joining the advanced cooperative, the total income was more than three hundred and twenty yuan. In addition, we also ate more than two hundred kilograms of dairy products without spending a penny." Speaking of this, Xiaoshun Ga pointed to the new cotton bedding on the corner of the kang and interjected: "Comrade! Do you think those few flowered quilts are good?" I said "Very good!" She then said: "In the past, our family only had two quilts, but this year we added three new ones!" His son Gangga also gesticulated and said: "Last year, on a cold day like this, we had to stay in the house. This year, my mother put on a long cotton robe, and I put on a fox fur hat. We have meat for almost every meal. We eat well and dress warmly, so we can still go to the grassland to pick up dung and chop firewood on such a cold day..." (Guang Zhi)

At the Family Appraisal Meeting

One evening at the end of last year, bright lights flickered in the three small western rooms of Zheng Quanlan's house, a member of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Weijia Village Township, Ju County, Shandong Province. The whole family of thirteen people was sitting around the room, appraising their individual production achievements over the past year. Last year, the family originally planned to earn 700 labor days, receive 750 yuan in dividends, and have a family sideline income of 185 yuan. The results of the inspection showed that the family actually earned 952 labor days throughout the year, received 782 yuan in dividends, and had a family sideline income of 252 yuan. The two items had an actual income of 1,034 yuan, exceeding the family's production plan. The head of the family, Zheng Quanlan, happily said to everyone: "In completing the family plan, let's compare and see who performed the best, and we will reward whoever that is. If anyone has shortcomings, we must also carry out criticism."

As soon as Zheng Quanlan finished speaking, his son Ji Xiang stood up and said: "In my opinion, Ji Cui should be rewarded. She originally planned to earn 150 labor days throughout the year, but now she has earned 205. I suggest rewarding her 20 yuan." Ji Xiang's fourth uncle then said to everyone: "I think rewarding Ji Cui 15 yuan is enough. When it comes to Ji Cui's labor, there is nothing to say, but she does a poor job of uniting with others. Besides, Ji Cui is also a girl of seventeen or eighteen years old, and she can't even do needlework well." Ji Cui, who was sitting across from her, blushed and said: "In the future, I must discuss things properly with others. I shouldn't be rewarded this time."

"Achievements are achievements, and shortcomings are shortcomings, but we can't treat them the same." With you saying one thing and me saying another, the small room became lively. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to award Ji Cui 15 yuan, Shu Mei 10 yuan, Jia Rong 10 yuan, and Ji Gui 5 yuan.

"I have one more point to make," Zheng Quanlan said: "I think Ji Xiang's performance this year is not good enough. The whole year's plan was to earn 190 labor days, but now he has only earned 185. He also did not do well in terms of family unity." Ji Xiang took a few puffs of his cigarette and said: "Yes! Not only did I fail to complete my personal production plan, but I also failed to do well in terms of family unity. I will humbly learn from others and ensure that I overfulfill my personal production plan next year." Then the whole family democratically discussed this year's family production increase and savings plan. (Hong Sheng, Zhi Jing)

Poor "Four Zhen" Have Become Rich

"Cooperativization has uprooted the poverty of our 'Four Zhen'!" That’s what members of the Xinsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Xinsheng Township, Tai’an County, Liaoning say.

The "Four Zhen" are Sun Guizhen, Cui Guizhen, Sun Guozhen, and Wang Guozhen, and they are all well-known poor households in Xinsheng Township. For the past few years since liberation, they have been relying on state relief to maintain their lives. These "Four Zhen" alone ate 11,200 jin of state relief grain, wore 163 pieces of relief clothing, and received more than 420 yuan in relief funds. In 1956, they joined the Xinsheng Advanced Cooperative together. Because the cooperative implemented planting according to local conditions, promoted new production-increasing technologies, and overcame waterlogging disasters, it achieved a bumper harvest, and their income also increased two or three times, finally getting rid of poverty.

Sun Guizhen, who had not paid agricultural tax since liberation and had eaten more than 4,000 jin of state relief grain, had an income in 1956 that was equivalent to three times his income in 1955. His family had two and a half laborers. In 1955, his income was 330 yuan. Last year, he worked 550 labor days in the cooperative and had a net income of 990 yuan. The family also raised two fat pigs, which were sold for 80 yuan. After leaving enough money for the whole family of seven to eat, wear, and spend, there was still 530 yuan left. Sun Guizhen happily said: "I am 54 years old, and this is the first year I have earned so much. This is the benefit that cooperativization has brought me!"

Wang Guozhen proudly said: "This time, I can take a big step!" This Wang Guozhen only used half a foot of cloth coupons issued by the government in 1954 and 1955. Last autumn, his whole family bought more than 130 feet of cloth, and the whole family changed into new cotton clothes with new linings, and also made three flowered quilts. Old man Wang Guozhen said to his son with emotion: "This year's harvest is the best harvest in sixty years. When wearing cotton clothes and covering new quilts, we can't forget that this is brought about by cooperativization!" Even Cui Guizhen, who did the fewest labor days, still earned more than 500 yuan, and after deducting the whole family's food, clothing, and use, there was still more than 120 yuan left. From their actual income, these "Four Zhen" saw the benefits of cooperativization, and they firmly said: We cannot leave the road of cooperativization even if we are beaten with sticks!

    向阳之地春常在，入社之家庆有余
    六十年来第一次收入多
    黑龙江省绥化县宝山农业社的收益分配工作结束了。收入最多的社员吕庆山一家，一共分到了一千五百多元。六十一岁的吕庆山感慨地说：“我一辈子头一回看到这么多花花绿绿的票子。”他一家八口，入冬以来差不多每个人都做了新衣裳。最近，他家正在买东西欢度春节。
    幼年时的吕庆山，家里很穷。冬天他连一双棉鞋都没有，实在冷得受不住；有时候看到一泡刚撒下来的热牛粪，就把脚插进里面取取暖。后来，吕庆山赶大车来往于绥化和哈尔滨之间，给人家运送货物，攒了些钱，买了点土地和两匹马。到土地改革的时候，吕庆山已经是一个下中农了。但是，他家的生活并没有改变多少。每当旧历年关到来，人家来索取欠债，吕庆山的妻子总是羞惭地不知说什么好。
    土地改革以后，吕庆山一家加上分到的土地，一共有八公顷多地，算上母马下的驹，也有四匹耕马了。三个男劳动力，两个女劳动力，又是一家勤快人。凭着人强、马壮、地多，吕庆山一直单干到1954年。这期间，有歉收年，也有丰收年。每年，一家人一年到头不停歇地干活，虽然收一万多斤粮食，可是除去四匹马的饲料，八个人的口粮，还有种子和第二年的生产投资，也就剩不下什么了。
    1954年冬季，吕庆山一家参加了农业社。1955年干下来的结果，一家人分到足够的口粮和烧柴，还清了历年欠下的债，还剩下两百多元现款。这时，吕庆山才后悔先前有顾虑，没有早些入社。
    1955年年末，他带着两个小马驹参加了高级社。1956年，社里利用统一经营的优越条件，采取一系列农业增产技术措施，因此每公顷粮食的平均产量比前一年提高了50％左右。加上副业收入，每个劳动日的报酬达到了两元多。吕庆山是社里劳动力较多的一家，经常保持五个劳动力参加社的生产，一年共做了七百二十多个劳动日。

    一年比一年富裕
    江苏省宝山县瑞丰乡光明农业社社员沈才明，全家有三个劳动力。去年，共做了六百多个劳动日，纯收入达一千零三十多元，比1955年增加一倍还多。另外，他家养猪、养羊等副业收入还有七十多元。
    在此以前，沈才明家并没有过这样多的收入。十五年前，沈才明夫妻两个从异乡流浪到瑞丰乡，租了几亩田种。回忆起从前，他感叹地说：“那时田无一尺，地无一寸。”解放以后，他家在土地改革中分到了田地。虽然生活好得多了，可是单门独户，生产困难，仍然没有摆脱贫困。
    1954年秋收过后，沈才明所在的前进村组织起农业社，沈才明第一个报名入了社。第二年社里增了产，他家收入四百多元，比入社前一年高出一倍多。他把两百多元作家庭生活开支，其余的钱用来还清过去的债务，并且买了六根木头，打算再遇到个好年成盖新屋。
    去年，沈才明家的收入又比1955年增加了一倍多，这就使他的家庭经济生活发生了根本的变化。全家七口人，分到粮食五千多斤，以米饭为主，每天都吃两顿干一顿稀。他家两张床上都放着新的花被褥，大人和小孩都有了新棉衣。他的妻子陈红梅告诉我说：“我家小姑娘穿了一身花格子布棉衣。大儿子年轻爱漂亮，做了件条子线呢布的棉袄。沈才明年纪大了不讲究，我就给他做了一身耐穿的黑老布棉衣裤。”她一面和我说着，一面还在替丈夫缝制新衬裤。
    生活好过了，沈才明把他的三儿子送进了小学校。他说，他的三儿子是沈家近几代来第一个读书人。　　（新华社记者周哲生）
  一个蒙民的幸福家庭
    冬天的坝上草原披上了银色的外衣，我迎着凛冽的寒风，来到了草原上五台（在河北省）蒙古营的巴图巴牙尔的家里。
    进了巴图巴牙尔的屋子，银珍和她的婆婆一面哼着动人的蒙族歌曲，一面在熬奶茶。她们见了我，好像见了久别重逢的朋友，又同我握手，又让我烤火取暖。我们正在热情地谈笑时，巴图巴牙尔进了屋。他和我打了招呼，就叫他的伙伴孝顺嘎端来奶子茶让我喝。
    我们喝着洁白的奶子茶，闲谈着，扯到牧民的生活情形方面来。巴图巴牙尔兴奋地向我笑着说：“高级合作化给我们蒙民带来了幸福。1956年我们全村二十户蒙民都增加了收入。就拿我这个家庭说吧，1955年单干时，农牧业总共收入了九十六元。1956年加入了高级社，总共收入了三百二十多元，此外，还吃了二百多斤奶食，没花一个钱。”说到这里，孝顺嘎指着炕角的新棉被褥插嘴道：“同志！你看那几条花棉被子好不好？”我随声说了句“很好！”她接着说：“过去我们全家只有两条被子，今年就新添了三条！”儿子岗嘎也指手画脚地说：“去年像这么冷的天，我们只得在屋子里呆着，今年俺母亲穿上了长棉袍，我戴上了狐狸皮帽，差不多每顿饭都有肉。吃的好，穿得暖，怎么冷的天也能照常到草滩上拣粪打柴……。”　　（广祉）
    在家庭评比会上
    去年年底的一天晚上，山东莒县魏家村乡前进农业社社员郑全兰家的三间小西屋里，闪烁着明晃晃的灯光。屋里围坐着全家十三口人，正在评比一年来的个人生产成绩。去年全家原计划挣劳动日七百个，分红七百五十元，家庭副业收入一百八十五元。检查的结果，全家全年实挣劳动日九百五十二个，分红七百八十二元，家庭副业收入二百五十二元，两项实收入一千零三十四元，超额完成全家生产计划。家长郑全兰高兴地向大家说：“在完成全家计划当中，咱比比看谁表现的最好，咱就奖励谁，谁要有缺点，咱也得开展批评。”
    郑全兰刚说完，儿子纪相站起来说：“照我看，纪翠得受奖励，她原计划全年挣劳动日一百五十个，现在挣了二百零五个。我的意见奖励她二十元。”纪相的四叔接着向大家说：“我看奖励纪翠十五元就不少，论起纪翠的劳动来是没说的，可是，她和别人的团结就做得差些。再说纪翠也是十七、八岁的闺女了，连针线活还做不好。”坐在对面的纪翠听了，红着脸说：“今后有事一定要好好的和别人商量，这次我不该受奖。”
    “成绩归成绩，缺点归缺点，可不能一样看待。”你一言我一语地，小屋里活跃起来，讨论的结果，决定奖给纪翠十五元、书梅十元、加荣十元、纪桂五元。
    “我再提一点，”郑全兰说：“我看纪相今年的表现就不够好，全年计划挣劳动日一百九十个，现在只挣了一百八十五个，在家庭团结方面，也做得不够。”纪相吧嗒吧嗒用劲吸了几口烟说：“是！我不光没有完成个人的生产计划，在家庭团结上也不好，我要虚心向别人学习，保证明年超额完成个人生产计划。”接着全家又民主讨论了今年家庭增产节约计划。　（洪盛、知敬）
    穷“四珍”变富了
    “合作化把咱们‘四珍’的穷根子拔掉了！”辽宁台安县新生乡新生农业社的社员都这样说。
    这“四珍”是孙贵珍、崔贵珍、孙国珍、王国珍，他们都是新生乡里出名的贫困户，解放后这几年一直靠国家救济维持生活。这“四珍”光吃国家救济粮就有一万一千二百斤，穿救济衣服一百六十三件，领救济款四百二十多元。1956年他们一块加入了新生高级社，因为合作社里实行了因地种植，推广了增产新技术，战胜水涝灾害，获得了丰收，他们的收入也随着增加了二、三倍，最后摆脱了贫困。
    从解放以来没缴过农业税，一共吃国家四千多斤救济粮的孙贵珍，1956年收入相当于1955年收入的三倍。他家两个半劳动力，1955年收入三百三十元；去年在社里做了五百五十个劳动日，净收入九百九十元；家里还养着两口肥猪，卖了八十元，除留够全家七口人吃、穿零花等钱，尚余五百三十元。孙贵珍高兴地说：“我活五十四岁，头一年收入这么多，这是合作化带给我的好处！”
    王国珍自豪地说：“这回我可迈开步了！”这个王国珍在1954、1955两年，政府发的布票只用了半尺。去年秋季，他全家买了一百三十多尺布，全家换上里面三新的棉衣，又做了三床花被。王国珍老大爷感动地对儿子说：“今年的收成是六十年来没有过的好收成，穿棉衣盖新被不能忘了这是合作化带来的！”连做劳动日最少的崔贵珍还收入五百多元，除去全家吃、穿用外，也余一百二十多元。这“四珍”从自己实际收入里，看到合作化的好处，他们坚定地说：棒打也不能离开合作化道路！
