    To turn "Five Shortages" into "Five Non-Shortages"
    The Yushu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party inspects the preparation of spring ploughing materials
    Timely solutions to problems such as lack of fertilizer, lack of feed, and lack of draught animals
    (This News Report) The Yushu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jilin Province, in inspecting the preparation of materials for spring ploughing production, discovered some urgent problems that need to be solved, and is trying everything possible to solve them one by one.

    Yushu County suffered a severe flood last year. In order to prepare for spring ploughing production in the disaster area in advance, the Yushu County Committee specifically inspected the preparation of spring ploughing production at the district committee secretary meeting in late January. At that time, it was found that five problems needed to be solved urgently. First, the county's existing manure fertilizer is only enough to fertilize 50% of the cultivated land area, and some agricultural cooperatives only have enough fertilizer to fertilize 30% of the cultivated land. Second, fifty-three agricultural cooperatives in the Huan Cheng District lack firewood. Third, the county is still short of 12 million jin of horse forage. Fourth, there is a shortage of draught animals. Fifth, about 170 agricultural cooperatives in the county have members who cannot receive all their food rations. The meeting put forward specific measures to address these problems. A fertilizer accumulation campaign should be launched throughout the county. In order to stimulate the enthusiasm of cooperative members' families in accumulating fertilizer, it was proposed to purchase manure fertilizer from cooperative members' families with cash, or exchange it for grain, or record work points and pay them after the autumn harvest. Past purchases of cooperative members' family fertilizer without payment should be settled, and payment should be made in full. Mobilize cooperative members to collect wild dry grass as a substitute feed before the thaw. Agricultural cooperatives should give cooperative members sufficient time to prepare firewood; they should also organize agricultural cooperatives with serious firewood shortages to go into the mountains to cut firewood. The solution to the shortage of draught animals is to strengthen livestock feeding and management to eliminate emaciation and death. Criticize the excessive demands that look down on "old cattle and weak horses," transform some non-draught animals into draught animals, and do a good job in adjusting the surplus and deficiency of draught animals within districts and townships. Continue to mobilize cooperative members to develop sideline production to increase income. In order to implement these measures, the county committee will organize a large number of cadres to go deep into the rural areas to help with the preparation of spring ploughing production, turn the "five shortages" into "five non-shortages," and ensure timely investment in spring ploughing production.

    要把“五缺”变成“五不缺”
    中共榆树县委检查春耕物资准备工作
    及时解决缺肥料缺饲料缺耕畜等问题
    本报讯　中共吉林榆树县委检查春耕生产物资准备工作中，发现了一些急待解决的问题，正在想一切办法逐一解决。
    榆树县去年遭到严重水灾，为提前做好灾区的春耕生产准备工作，榆树县委在1月下旬区委书记会议上，具体地检查了春耕生产准备工作。当时发现有五个问题急待解决。第一，全县现有的粪肥只够施50％的耕地面积，有些农业社的肥料只够施30％的耕地。第二，环城区有五十三个农业社缺烧柴。第三，全县尚缺一千二百万斤马草。第四，耕畜不足。第五，全县约有一百七十多个农业社的社员不能全部领回吃粮。会上针对这些问题提出了各项具体措施。要在全县范围内掀起一个积肥高潮。为刺激社员家庭积肥的积极性，提出用现金收买社员家庭的粪肥，或用粮食换、记工分秋后付酬等方式换取社员家肥。过去收买社员家肥没付酬的，要清理账目，一律付酬。发动社员在化冻以前，搂野干草做代用饲料。农业社要给社员充分时间，以便准备烧柴；还要组织严重缺柴的农业社入山砍柴。解决耕畜不足的办法是：加强牲畜饲养管理，消灭瘦弱和死亡现象。批判看不起“老牛、弱马”的过高要求，把一部分非役畜变成役畜，并做好区、乡内的耕畜余缺的调剂工作。继续发动社员开展副业生产增加收入。为贯彻执行这些措施，县委将组织大批干部深入农村帮助进行春耕生产准备工作，要把“五缺”变成“五不缺”，保证适时投入春耕生产。
