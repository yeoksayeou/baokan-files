Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 16th: Egyptian President Nasser, in a radio address to the Syrian people on the 15th, called on Arabs to unite and "frustrate the colonialists' conspiracy and defeat their plan based on divide and conquer." He said that Arabs "will never be willing to act as pawns for foreign political purposes."

Nasser said: "The first stage of the battle is over. Today we are experiencing a new stage in the development of Arab nationalism, and we are facing the conspiracies of imperialism and its supporters."

Nasser said: "The purpose of imperialism has always been to eliminate Arab nationalism, create discord within the Arabs, and dominate and exploit Arab countries."

He said that Arab countries must "unite and reaffirm our demands for Arab nationalism, which is our shield against Israeli and imperialist ambitions."

Nasser praised Syria, saying: "Syria has always stood on the front line of the battle and firmly supported the cause of Arab nationalism." He thanked Syria for its support to Egypt during the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt.

The conference for the Syrian people to raise funds for Port Said opened in Damascus on the 15th. Nasser delivered this radio address for the opening of the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Cairo News: Dr. Anup Singh, Secretary of the Asian Solidarity Committee and a member of the Indian Parliament, who is visiting Egypt, said at a press conference in Cairo on the 15th that Egyptian President Nasser had stated that Egypt could only agree to allow the United Nations Emergency Force to be stationed in the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba if Israel unconditionally withdrew from these areas, and if the United Nations Emergency Force agreed to withdraw at any time Egypt requested it.

Singh said that Nasser also said when he received the friendly delegation of the Asian Solidarity Committee on the 14th that when the Suez Canal Company was nationalized, British and French ships refused to pay tolls, but we allowed them to pass because we did not want to exacerbate the tension. Now, the situation is completely different, and Egypt will require them to pay tolls.

Nasser told Singh that Britain and France are now waging psychological and economic warfare against Egypt, but I am not worried because the Egyptian people understand the tricks of the imperialists.

Nasser also told Singh that he welcomed the holding of the Asian-African People's Conference in Cairo. He said that the Bandung Spirit should continue to exist and be promoted, and Egypt will definitely support the people's desire for unity. He told Singh, "When I went to the Bandung Conference, I was the first Egyptian politician to go to the East. I believe that the future of our people lies in working together with various forces in Asia, while maintaining friendly relations with the West."

Yang Shuo, a Chinese writer and member of the friendly delegation of the Asian Solidarity Committee, told reporters that during his visit to Egypt, he saw the confidence and new spirit of the Egyptian people, and that the Egyptian people showed during the war of resistance that they were determined to fight for independence and freedom.

The other two members of the delegation, Soviet writer Sofronov and Japanese journalist Masaharu Hatanaka, also spoke about their impressions of Egypt and expressed their respect and love for the Egyptian people.

    挫败殖民主义者的阴谋
    纳赛尔号召阿拉伯人加强团结
    坚持以色列必须无条件撤军
    新华社开罗16日电　埃及总统纳赛尔15日在对叙利亚人民发表的广播演说中号召阿拉伯人团结，“挫败殖民主义者的阴谋，使他们以各个击破为基础的计划归于失败”。他说，阿拉伯人“决不甘愿充当外国政治目的的爪牙”。
    纳赛尔说：“战斗的第一个阶段过去了。今天我们正在经历阿拉伯民族主义发展中的新阶段，我们正面临帝国主义和它的支持者的阴谋。”
    纳赛尔说：“帝国主义的目的始终是消灭阿拉伯民族主义、制造阿拉伯人内部不和并且统治和剥削阿拉伯国家。”
    他说，阿拉伯国家必须“团结一致和重申我们对阿拉伯民族主义的要求，阿拉伯民族主义是我们抵抗以色列和帝国主义野心的屏障”。
    纳赛尔赞扬叙利亚说：“叙利亚始终站在战斗的前线，并且坚决支持阿拉伯民族主义事业。”他感谢叙利亚在英法以色列侵略埃及期间给予埃及支持。
    叙利亚人民为赛得港筹募基金的会议15日在大马士革开幕。纳赛尔是为这个会议开幕而发表这篇广播演说的。
    新华社16日讯　开罗消息：正在埃及访问的亚洲团结委员会秘书、印度国会议员阿努普·辛格博士15日在开罗举行的记者招待会上说，埃及总统纳赛尔曾经表示，除非以色列无条件撤出加沙地带和亚喀巴湾，并且联合国紧急部队同意在埃及要求它撤退的任何时候撤走，埃及才能同意让联合国紧急部队驻在这两个地区。
    辛格说，纳赛尔14日在接见亚洲团结委员会友好代表团时还说，在把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的时候，英国和法国的船只曾经拒绝缴纳通行费，当时我们让它们通过了，因为我们不想使紧张局势加剧。现在，情况完全不同了，埃及将要求它们缴纳通行费。
    纳赛尔对辛格说，英国和法国现在正在对埃及展开心理战和经济战，但是我并不担心，因为埃及人民是懂得帝国主义者的把戏的。
    纳赛尔还向辛格表示，他欢迎在开罗举行亚非人民会议。他说，万隆精神应当存在下去，并且加以发扬，埃及一定支持人民要求团结的愿望。他对辛格说，当我去参加万隆会议的时候，我是到东方去的第一个埃及政治家。我觉得我国人民的前途在于同亚洲各种力量通力合作，同时也同西方保持友好关系。
    亚洲团结委员会友好代表团团员、中国作家杨朔对记者们说，他在埃及访问期间，看到了埃及人民的信心和新精神，埃及人民在抗战期间表明了他们坚决要为独立和自由而战。
    代表团另外两位团员、苏联作家索弗罗诺夫和日本新闻工作者畑中政春也谈到了他们对埃及的印象，并且表示他们尊敬和热爱埃及人民。
