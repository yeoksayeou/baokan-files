    Northern Bees Visit Guangdong as Guests

    (Our report) The bee farms, state-owned farms, and agricultural producers' cooperatives in Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces have transported a large number of bees to Guangdong to spend the winter. Currently, more than 6,000 boxes of bees are being kept in state-owned farms and agricultural cooperatives in various counties along the Pearl River, Han River, and North River.

    In late winter and early spring, the ice and snow in Henan, Hubei, and other places have not yet melted, making beekeeping quite unfavorable. However, at this time, broad bean flowers and rapeseed flowers are in full bloom in the fields of Guangdong, and bees can find delicious food everywhere and continue to produce honey. The bees' collection of flowers improves the pollination rate of crops, and Guangdong farmers believe this is a small gift brought by the bees.

    北方蜜蜂到广东作客
    本报讯　河南、湖北、湖南等省的养蜂场，国营农场和农业生产合作社已把大批蜜蜂运送到广东去过冬。现在，在珠江、韩江和北江两岸各县的国营农场和农业社里寄养的蜜蜂已有六千多箱。
    冬末春初，河南、湖北等地冰雪尚未溶化，养蜂颇为不利。但是，这时候，广东田野上蚕豆花、油菜花正在盛开，蜂儿处处都能找到鲜美的食料，继续结蜜。蜜蜂采花使作物的授粉率得到提高，广东农民认为这是蜂儿捎来的一点礼物。
