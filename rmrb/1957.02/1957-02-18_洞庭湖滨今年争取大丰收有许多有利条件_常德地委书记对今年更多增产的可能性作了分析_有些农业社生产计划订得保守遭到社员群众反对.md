Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 17th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Luo Huren): The Dongting Lake rice-producing area, which had a good harvest last year, still has great potential for increased production. This is what Sun Yunying, Secretary of the Changde Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, told reporters. He said that it is entirely possible to strive for an even greater harvest this year.

Sun Yunying said: There are now more than 8,000 agricultural cooperatives in the Changde area, and more than 3,700 have already set their production plans for this year. However, some counties and districts have exaggerated the shortcomings and mistakes of last year's work during the rectification of the cooperatives, which has led to a lack of enthusiasm among some cadres for striving for a bumper harvest this year. They are afraid of being rash, afraid of difficulties, and lack confidence. As a result, the production plans of some cooperatives are set too low. Taojiang County inspected the plans of 231 cooperatives, and only two of them were advanced and reliable, while the plans of the remaining 229 cooperatives were too low. When some cooperative cadres set the plans too low, the cooperative members disagreed. For example, the cadres stationed in the Renyi Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanjiang County and the cooperative cadres set the yield of early rice at only 450 jin per mu, but the production team discussion increased it to 465 jin, and the poor peasant cooperative members said: As long as we work hard, 600 jin can be achieved. This cooperative has 1,956 mu of paddy fields, and the area planted with double-cropping rice last year accounted for 80%, but this year it has been reduced to 40%, which the cooperative members also disagree with. The cooperative committee discussed the fertilizer accumulation target of 80 dan per mu, but the production team demanded an increase to 120 dan. The cooperative members said: If we don't plant double-cropping rice and don't accumulate more fertilizer, just shouting about increasing production is empty talk.

Because these plans are conservatively set, the enthusiasm of cooperative members for increasing production is affected, labor competitions cannot be launched, and some advanced technologies and farming systems that were effective in the past are also ignored. There are even erroneous practices such as changing double-cropping to single-cropping, dense planting to sparse planting, and good seeds to inferior seeds. If this continues, it will not only affect this year's increase in production and the increase in income and improvement in the lives of cooperative members, but also affect the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the speed of national industrialization, which will seriously alienate us from the masses.

The reason for this phenomenon, he said, is mainly that the cadres do not understand the real situation below, listen to the reflections of wealthy peasants one-sidedly, and do not listen to the opinions and calls of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants; secondly, they lack a correct understanding of objective things, only see the difficulties, and do not see the favorable conditions this year, or see the difficulties as greater and the favorable conditions as fewer. The current difficulties are: because last year was the first year of cooperation, the cadres still lacked experience, so some shortcomings such as coercion and commandism and subjectivism were generated in the work, so there are still some problems in the relationship between cadres and the masses and in business management. Again, there is a shortage of production materials, and 5% of the backward cooperatives have more problems. These are some of the difficulties in the process of progress. However, after a year of cooperative production movement, it has brought more favorable conditions for this year's production.

There are many favorable conditions for the Dongting Lake area to strive for a greater harvest this year. First, 98% of the farmers in the entire area have joined advanced cooperatives, and the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members will be further promoted. In the past, there were many disputes over water conservancy and cutting lake grass for fertilizer in the Dongting Lake Plain, but after advanced cooperation, these disputes naturally disappeared with the change of production relations, which is more conducive to unified planting and promotion of technological reforms according to local conditions. Secondly, the broad masses of farmers, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, have seen the superiority of agricultural cooperatives from practice. They are all determined to support the good management of the cooperatives and demand to improve production and strive for a bumper harvest. According to a recent survey in Changde County, 91% of the 156 poor and lower-middle peasant cooperative members are actively engaged in production, and some even go to work in the snow. Third, after several years of cooperative production movement, the entire area has cultivated a large number of competent leading backbones and developed more than 40,000 party members and Communist Youth League members, all of whom have certain production and cooperative management experience, which was not available last year. Fourth, the recent rectification of the cooperatives has further improved the relationship between cadres and the masses, resolved some outstanding economic issues in the transfer of cooperatives, and implemented the policy of mutual benefit, which has greatly increased the socialist enthusiasm of cooperative cadres and cooperative members. After the rectification of the cooperatives, among the 1.5 million cooperative members in the entire area, except for 313 wealthy peasants who withdrew from the cooperatives, all resolutely supported the good management of agricultural cooperatives. Fifth, after a year of running the cooperatives, most of the cooperatives have accumulated a certain amount of public accumulation funds and public property. At this time last year, the rural areas were still building cooperatives; the masses' thinking was unstable, the cattle were unattended, and the seeds were not collected. This year, the entire area started production early, most of the cattle are well-fed, and the seeds and fodder are sufficient. To date, 86% of the paddy fields have been plowed, and an average of 60 dan of fertilizer per mu has been accumulated, all of which are better than last year. After basically ending the rectification of the cooperatives, most of the cooperatives have set their production plans and made preparations for contracted quotas, etc., two months earlier than last year, taking the initiative in production time. Sixth, the water conservancy conditions are also better than last year. The winter repairs of the dikes in the lake area increased by more than 13 million cubic meters of earth compared with 1955, and the drainage and irrigation system in the dikes is being vigorously repaired; the hilly and mountainous areas have also newly built 85 reservoirs and more than 3,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. In addition, 110 pumping machines with a total of 2,600 horsepower have been newly installed. After these projects are completed, 165,000 mu of rain-fed fields can be irrigated, and more than 113,000 mu of lake wasteland can be turned into fertile land. These two items alone can increase grain production by at least 73 million jin. Seventh, the land here is fertile, the climate is mild, the natural conditions are good, most areas can grow double-cropping rice, and the potential for increased production is great. In addition, some experience has been gained in technological reforms last year, such as double-cropping rice is the main way to increase production, appropriate dense planting, seizing the gap of cold currents to cultivate strong seedlings, and rice and cotton improved varieties have been generally recognized by the masses, which has laid a favorable foundation for further promotion.

Finally, Sun Yunying said with confidence: As long as these favorable conditions are fully utilized, it is entirely possible to strive for a bumper harvest. In order to overcome negative factors and promote positive factors, the counties are now holding enlarged cadre meetings and taking effective measures to further mobilize the masses in a comprehensive manner to carry out the great production movement.

    洞庭湖滨今年争取大丰收有许多有利条件
    常德地委书记对今年更多增产的可能性作了分析
    有些农业社生产计划订得保守遭到社员群众反对
    新华社长沙17日电　新华社记者罗厚仁报道：去年丰收的洞庭湖滨稻产区还有很大的增产潜力。这是中共常德地委书记孙云英对记者说的。他说，争取今年更大的丰收是完全可能的。
    孙云英说：常德专区现在有八千多个农业社，已经有三千七百多个社订了今年的生产计划。但是，有些县区由于在整社中夸大了去年工作的缺点和错误，以致部分干部对争取今年大丰收劲头不大，怕冒进，怕困难，没信心。因此，有些社的生产计划订得偏低。桃江县检查了二百三十一个社的计划，其中只有两个社订得先进可靠，其余二百二十九个社的计划都偏低。有些社社干把计划订低了，社员都不同意。如沅江县人益农业社的驻社干部和社干对今年的早稻产量每亩只订四百五十斤，但生产队讨论时就增加到了四百六十五斤，贫农社员却说：只要努把力，六百斤也能达到。这个社一千九百五十六亩水田，去年种双季稻的面积占80％，今年缩小到40％，社员也不同意。社委会讨论积肥指标是每亩八十担，到生产队却要求增加到一百二十担。社员们说：不插双季稻，不多积点肥，光喊增产是空家伙。
    由于这些计划订得保守，社员增产热情受到影响，劳动竞赛开展不起来，有的对过去一些行之有效的先进技术和耕作制度也忽视了，甚至出现双季改单季、密植改稀植和良种改劣种等错误做法。如果这样下去，不但影响今年的增产和社员收入的增加以及生活的改善，也影响农业社的巩固和国家工业化的速度，结果将严重地脱离群众。
    产生这个现象的原因，他说，主要是干部不了解下面的真实情况，片面地听了富裕农民的反映，没有倾听广大贫农和下中农的意见和呼声；其次就是对客观事物缺乏正确认识，只看到困难，没有看到今年的有利条件，或对困难看得大一些，有利条件看得少一些。目前的困难是：由于去年是合作化后的第一年，干部还缺乏经验，因此，在工作中产生一些强迫命令和主观主义等缺点，以致干群关系上和经营管理上还存在一些问题。再次是生产物资不足，有5％的后进社问题较多。这都是前进中的一些困难。但是，经过一年来的合作生产运动，却给今年生产带来更多的有利条件。
    今年洞庭湖滨争取更大的丰收，有利条件是很多的。第一，全专区98％的农户加入了高级社，社员的劳动积极性将得到进一步发扬，过去湖滨平原历史上的水利和割湖草积肥等纠纷很多，高级合作化后，这些纠纷随着生产关系的改变就自然消除了，更便于因地制宜统一种植和推广技术改革。其次广大农民特别是贫农和下中农从实践中看到了农业社的优越性，他们都坚决拥护办好社，要求把生产搞好，争取一个大丰收。据常德县最近的调查，一百五十六户贫农和下中农社员，其中有91％是积极生产的，有的在雪天还出工。第三，经过几年来的合作生产运动，全区已培养了大批能力较强的领导骨干，发展了四万多名党员和青年团员，他们都有一定的生产和办社经验，这是去年所没有的。第四，通过最近整社进一步改善了干部与群众之间的关系，转社中处理了一些遗留的经济问题，贯彻了互利政策，使社干部和社员的社会主义积极性大大提高了。整社后，全区一百五十多万户社员中，除三百一十三户富裕农民退社外，都坚决拥护办好农业社。第五，经过一年办社，绝大部分社积累有一定公积金和公共财产。去年这时候，农村还在建社；群众思想不稳定，耕牛无人管，种籽未筹集。今年，全区生产动手早，耕牛绝大部分喂养得好，种籽饲料都留足了，到现在，板田已翻耕了86％，每亩水田平均积有六十担肥料，哪一项都胜过去年。全区在基本结束整社后，大部分合作社已订好生产计划，作好了包工定额等工作，比去年提早两个月，在生产时间上掌握了主动。第六，水利条件也比去年好，湖区大堤冬修比1955年增加了一千三百万多方土，垸内排灌系统正在大力整修；丘陵山区又新修了八十五座水库和三千多处小型农田水利工程，另外，还新安装了一百一十部共二千六百马力的抽水机。这些工程完成后，可使十六万五千亩天水田得到灌溉，使十一万三千多亩湖荒洼地变为良田。仅这两项至少可增产粮食七千三百万斤。第七，这里的土地肥沃，气候温和，自然条件好，大部地区可种双季稻，增产潜力很大，加之去年在技术改革上摸索了一些经验，如双季稻是增产的主要门路，适当密植，抓住寒流空隙培养壮秧以及稻、棉良种等已为群众所公认，这就为进一步推广打下了有利基础。
    最后，孙云英满怀信心地说：只要充分发挥这些有利条件，争取一个大丰收是完全可能的。为了克服消极因素，发扬积极因素，现在各县正在召开扩大干部会议，采取有效措施，进一步全面地发动群众开展大生产运动。
