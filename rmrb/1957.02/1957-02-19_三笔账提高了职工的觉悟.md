    This newspaper reports that the Shanxi Machine Factory has been conducting political and ideological education for its workers by calculating "three accounts," which has raised the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of workers and promoted activities to check waste and find ways to save money. Now, all the factory's workers have formulated an annual plan for increasing production and practicing economy, striving to increase production and save at least more than one million yuan for the country throughout the year.

    When formulating the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, the Shanxi Machine Factory mobilized the workers to calculate the following "three accounts": First, the workers were mobilized to calculate a large account of the welfare facilities and wage increases over the past few years. The workers generally felt that their personal lives had greatly improved, but their contributions to the country were too small and their work was too poor. They expressed that they would work hard in the future to catch up with the needs of the country. Then, the workers were asked to calculate two accounts of how much wealth they had accumulated for the country in the past in production and what they would contribute to the country in the future in the movement to increase production and practice economy. When calculating these two accounts, the workers checked and exposed waste phenomena from production and life, criticized wrong ideas, and formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. The Liu Defu lathe team in the metalworking workshop found that, in the past, due to lax labor discipline, the total downtime loss of the team's eight machine tools reached more than 10,700 yuan throughout the year. The team workers proposed that in the future, each person should arrive five to ten minutes early to prepare for production when going to work, and must start the machines on time. Everyone also formulated ten measures to reduce defective product man-hours and reduce equipment accidents. In this way, they plan to increase production and save more than 18,000 yuan of wealth this year.

    Like the workers of the Liu Defu team, all the factory's workers quickly joined the movement to increase production and practice economy after criticizing wrong ideas. Various sections, workshops, work sections, and teams have formulated plans and guarantee measures for increasing production and practicing economy.

    In the process of mobilizing the workers to formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy, the Shanxi Machine Factory combined the revision of product man-hour quotas, the implementation of economic accounting in work teams, and the strengthening of economic activity analysis to improve the level of enterprise management. This year, the factory can increase production and save more than one million yuan of wealth in terms of improving labor productivity, saving material usage, improving product quality, improving labor organization, and reducing downtime waste.

    三笔账提高了职工的觉悟
    本报讯　山西机器厂通过算“三笔账”的办法对职工进行政治思想教育，提高了广大职工群众的思想觉悟，推动了检查浪费和寻找节约门路的活动。现在全厂职工已制订出全年的增产节约计划，争取全年至少给国家增产节约一百多万元。
    山西机器厂在制订增产节约计划的时候，发动职工算了下面“三笔账”：首先发动职工算了几年来生活福利设施和工资增长的一笔大账，职工们普遍感到个人生活有了很大改善和提高，然而对国家贡献太少，工作做得太差，表示要在今后努力工作赶上国家需要。接着要职工们算了过去在生产上为国家积累了多少财富和今后在增产节约运动中要向国家贡献些什么的两笔账。在算这两笔账的时候，职工们从生产上和生活上检查和揭发了浪费现象，批判了错误思想，并且订出了增产节约计划。金工车间刘德甫车工组发现过去因为劳动纪律松弛，全组八部机床全年停工损失达一万零七百多元。小组工人提出今后在上班时每人要提前五至十分钟做好生产准备工作，必须准时开车干活。大家又在降低废品工时、减少设备事故等方面制订出十项措施，这样，他们今年计划可增产节约一万八千多元的财富。
    全厂职工群众和刘德甫小组工人一样，经过批判错误思想，迅速投入了增产节约运动。各科室、车间、工段、小组都制订出增产节约计划和保证措施。
    山西机器厂在发动职工群众制订增产节约计划过程中，结合从修订产品工时定额、推行班组经济核算、加强经济活动分析来提高企业管理水平。今年全厂在提高劳动生产率、节省材料使用、提高产品质量、改善劳动组织、减少停工浪费方面共可增产节约一百多元财富。
