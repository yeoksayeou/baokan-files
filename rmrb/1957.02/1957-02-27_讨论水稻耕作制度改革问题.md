Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 23rd: The Ministry of Agriculture held a symposium on rice reform technology at the Huazhong Agricultural Science Research Institute in Wuchang, discussing the important measure of increasing grain production – the reform of rice cultivation systems.

Last year, the area of single-season rice converted to double-season rice, intercropped double-season rice converted to continuous double-season rice, and Indica rice converted to Japonica rice increased by more than 50 million mu compared to 1955. Including dry land converted to paddy fields, the total increase in grain production exceeded 6 billion jin. While affirming the above achievements, the symposium also pointed out that due to the large scope of the reform and insufficient experience, problems also arose. These were: some regions exceeded possible conditions and carried out conversion on unsuitable land; some regions, due to the excessive area of conversion, not only experienced labor shortages, but also lacked sufficient prepared seeds, resulting in the planting of lower-quality seeds, which affected yields. In response to the above situation, the symposium proposed: regions where the conversion to double-season rice and Japonica rice increased production last year should primarily consolidate existing achievements this year and appropriately develop them under possible conditions. Regions with poor or non-existent conditions should actively create conditions for continued trial planting. After the trial proves effective, demonstration planting should be carried out, and then gradually promoted. In the reform, the planting of main grains, oil crops, and other cash crops should be rationally arranged according to national plans and people's needs, to achieve the goal of increasing production in all aspects throughout the year.

The symposium also analyzed the long-standing debate in academic circles regarding the development of double-season rice in the Taihu Lake area and the Chengdu Plain. Based on several years of trial planting in these regions, large-scale promotion was carried out last year, and double-season rice yielded more than single-season rice. Continued efforts in the future can further improve yields. The symposium believes that in the above regions, if appropriate arrangements can be made to the original cultivation system, treating the cultivation of double-season rice as an additional season, it will be beneficial to increasing production.

In the past, the labor shortage that occurred during the development of double-season rice often caused delays in farming time, affecting yields. The symposium believes that in addition to improving the organization of labor, methods such as using high-yielding varieties with different maturity periods or staggered seedling cultivation can be adopted to stagger the transplanting and harvesting periods. Last year, Tongli Cooperative in Wuchang County used this method to solve the problem of labor shortages.

Regarding the development of Japonica rice, the symposium unanimously affirmed that the promotion of Japonica rice in various regions last year was basically successful. Late Japonica rice in most areas of Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces achieved bumper harvests. Jiangsu Province's 6.5 million mu of Japonica rice increased production by 700 million jin. Although the yield of early Japonica rice was not high in some individual regions, the harvest from both seasons calculated together did not result in a reduction in production or a small reduction, while many regions also saw many examples of high-yield successes. Therefore, developing Japonica rice in accordance with local conditions and field conditions is one of the important measures to increase grain production.

Last year, early Japonica rice in some regions headed prematurely. According to the meeting's analysis, this phenomenon was not because the stage development had not been completed, but because it was completed too quickly, and the growth conditions could not keep up, resulting in reduced production. The meeting summarized some successful experiences, believing that taking measures such as early sowing, early transplanting, and early topdressing in suitable fields to meet the needs of its early growth can avoid premature heading and obtain better harvests. Therefore, not only can late Japonica rice increase production, but early and mid-season Japonica rice also have development prospects.

This symposium was held from the 14th to the 21st, with the participation of cadres from agricultural departments in ten provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Sichuan, as well as more than 30 experts and professors from six agricultural scientific research institutions and educational institutions in East China, Central China, and Southwest China.

    讨论水稻耕作制度改革问题
    共同认为：去年实行改革后增产的地区，今年要巩固成绩并继续推行，其他地区应创造条件试行
    新华社武汉23日电　农业部在武昌华中农业科学研究所举行的水稻改制技术座谈会，讨论了增产粮食的重要措施——水稻的改制问题。
    去年全国单季稻改双季稻、间作双季稻改连作双季稻、籼稻改粳稻的面积共比1955年增加五千多万亩，连同旱田改水田在内，一共增产粮食六十亿斤以上。座谈会在肯定上述成就的同时，还指出：由于改革范围大、经验不足，也发生了问题，这就是：有些地区超过可能条件，在不适宜的土地上进行了改种；有些地区由于改制面积过大，不仅劳动力比较紧张，而且造成准备的种籽不够，以致种了质量较低的种籽影响了产量。针对上述情况，座谈会提出：去年改种双季稻和粳稻增产的地区，今年主要巩固已有的成绩，在可能条件下适当发展，条件较差或不具备的地区，应积极创造条件，继续试种，试验证明确有成效，再进行示范种植，然后逐步推广。改制中对主要粮食、油料和其他经济作物的种植，要根据国家计划和人民需要作合理安排，以达到全面全年增产的要求。
    座谈会上对学术界争论已久的太湖地区和成都平原发展双季稻的问题也作了分析：这些地区在几年来试种的基础上，去年进行了大面积的推广，双季都比一季稻增产，今后继续努力还可提高。座谈会认为在上述地区如能对原有耕作制度，进行适当安排，将栽培双季稻作为增种一季来看待，对增产是有益的。
    过去在发展双季稻时，曾出现的劳力紧张现象，往往造成延误农时影响产量。座谈会认为除改善劳动力的组织外，可以采用成熟期不同的丰产品种或分期育秧的办法，将插秧和收获期错开。去年武昌县同力社，就用这个方法解决了劳力紧张的问题。
    对发展粳稻的问题，座谈会一致肯定去年各地推广粳稻基本是成功的。江苏、湖北、湖南等省大部地区的晚粳都获得了丰收，江苏省六百五十万亩粳稻增产了七亿斤。虽然个别地区早粳产量不高，但从两季的收获计算，并未减产或者减产不大，而不少地区还出现了许多高额丰产的范例。因此，因地制宜、因田制宜地发展粳稻，是增产粮食的重要措施之一。
    去年，部分地区的早粳曾经提前抽穗，据会议分析，这种现象不是阶段发育没有通过，而是通过的太快，生长条件跟不上去，所以减产。会议总结了一些成功的经验，认为在适宜的田地采取早播、早插、早追肥等措施，来满足其前期生长的需要，是可以避免过早抽穗、获得较好收成的。因此，不仅晚粳可以增产，早粳中粳也有其发展前途。
    这次座谈会是在14日到21日举行的，参加座谈会的有苏、浙、皖、闽、赣、湘、鄂、粤、桂、川等十个省的农业部门的干部和华东、华中、西南等六个农业科学研究机关和教育机关的专家、教授等三十多人。
