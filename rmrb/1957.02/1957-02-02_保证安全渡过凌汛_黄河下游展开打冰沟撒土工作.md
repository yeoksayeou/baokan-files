    Ensuring Safe Passage Through the Ice Flood
    Lower Yellow River Deploys Ice Breaking and Soil Spreading Efforts
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The lower reaches of the Yellow River, from Hekou in Lijin to Heigangkou near Kaifeng, are almost entirely frozen, with the exception of a few sections. Preparations for ice flood prevention in the lower reaches have entered a tense phase.
    This year, the Yellow River's lower reaches froze earlier and with thicker ice than in previous years. In general sections, the ice thickness ranges from six to thirty centimeters, with the thickest reaching fifty centimeters. In many places, the river is frozen in five layers.
    In order to ensure a safe passage through the ice flood, relevant departments in the lower Yellow River region, particularly in Shandong Province, have taken various preventative measures. It is understood that ice breaking and soil spreading work is being carried out extensively in areas below Qihe and Jinan. Twenty-eight blasting teams have been trained and dispatched to designated locations.
    Several artillery units, carrying weapons and ammunition, were deployed to dangerous sections on the 18th to assist in ice flood prevention. If necessary, the Air Force will also provide assistance.

    保证安全渡过凌汛
    黄河下游展开打冰沟撒土工作
    新华社讯　黄河下游从河口利津到开封附近黑岗口，除少数河段外已经全部封冻。下游的防凌准备工作已开始进入紧张阶段。
    今年，黄河下游封冻较往年为早，而且冰厚。一般河段冰厚达六公分到三十公分，最厚的达到五十公分，还有不少地方河内封冻达五层。
    为了保证安渡凌汛，黄河下游地区特别是山东省有关部门已经采取各种防范措施。据了解，齐河、济南以下各地正普遍进行打冰沟撒土工作，经过训练的二十八个爆破队也已分赴指定地点。
    若干炮兵部队已于18日携带武器、弹药开往险要地段，协助防凌。必要时，空军方面也要协助。
