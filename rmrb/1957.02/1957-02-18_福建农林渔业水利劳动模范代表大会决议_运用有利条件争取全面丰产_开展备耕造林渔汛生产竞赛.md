Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 17th. The Fujian Province 1956 Annual Agricultural, Forestry, Fishery, and Water Conservancy Labor Model Representative Conference passed a resolution to launch a sustained and large-scale production increase emulation campaign throughout the province. Currently, special emphasis will be placed on launching an emulation drive centered on spring plowing, afforestation, and spring fishing season production, in order to lay a reliable foundation for achieving the province's goal of reaching a total grain output of over 9.4 billion catties this year, and for the total output value of agriculture, forestry, and sideline occupations to increase by nearly 20% compared to last year.

This resolution was passed after the Representative Conference conscientiously summarized the production increase achievements of the first year of cooperation and extensively exchanged production increase experiences. The Representative Conference believes that in order to comprehensively achieve the 1957 production increase plan for agriculture, forestry, fishery, and sideline occupations in the province, it is necessary to profoundly accept the beneficial experiences and lessons of the previous year, give full play to Fujian's favorable natural conditions, such as being located in the subtropics, having spring-like weather all year round, abundant resources, and treasures everywhere, and resolutely implement the policy of taking grain production as the main focus and comprehensively developing the rural economy.

In terms of agricultural production, the Representative Conference pointed out that it is necessary to launch a water conservancy construction movement with small-scale water conservancy as the main focus, both to increase and improve 3 million mu of irrigation area and to strengthen the maintenance and management of existing water conservancy facilities. Increasing and applying fertilizer mainly relies on vigorously developing pig raising to accumulate fertilizer and expanding the planting of green manure, mobilizing the vast number of commune members to extensively dig up various household fertilizer sources. In addition, it is necessary to consolidate the achievements of changing the cultivation system last year in a manner appropriate to local conditions. Any changes that were inappropriate last year should be reasonably adjusted. Land where conditions permit can be appropriately expanded in accordance with local conditions, and the cultivation techniques of various crops, centered on close planting, should be actively promoted. In terms of forestry production, the main focus should be on strengthening the protection and management of existing forests and preventing mountain forest fires. Afforestation techniques should be improved, and agricultural cooperatives should be encouraged to do their best to collect, cultivate, and plant their own seedlings to ensure seedling quality and meet the needs of large-scale afforestation. In terms of fishery production, it is necessary to vigorously improve production tools and techniques, and promote the rotation and combination of various tools to achieve year-round production.

The labor model representatives also believe that in order to strive for comprehensive production increase, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of running cooperatives democratically and thriftily.

This conference was held from the 8th to the 16th. The more than 800 agricultural, forestry, fishery, and water conservancy labor model representatives who attended the meeting mostly emerged in the first year of cooperation.

    福建农林渔业水利劳动模范代表大会决议
    运用有利条件争取全面丰产
    开展备耕造林渔汛生产竞赛
    新华社福州17日电　福建省1956年度农、林、渔业和水利劳动模范代表大会通过决议，要在全省范围内开展一个持久的规模宏大的增产竞赛运动；当前，特别要开展一次以备耕、造林和春季渔汛生产为中心内容的竞赛运动，为实现今年粮食总产量达到九十四亿多斤、农林业和副业总产值共计比去年增加近二成的计划打下可靠的基础。
    这个决议是代表大会认真地总结了合作化第一年的增产成绩和广泛地交流了增产经验以后通过的。代表大会认为要想争取全面实现1957年全省农、林、渔业和副业生产的增产计划，必须深刻地接受上年有益的经验教训，充分发挥福建地处亚热带，四季如春，资源丰富，到处是宝等有利的自然条件，坚决贯彻以粮食生产为主全面发展农村经济的方针。
    在农业生产方面，代表大会指出要开展以小型水利为主的兴修水利运动，既要增加和改善三百万亩灌溉面积，又要加强对现有水利设施的养护管理；增积和增施肥料主要依靠大力开展养猪积肥和扩大种植绿肥，发动广大社员大量挖掘各种农家肥源；此外，要因地制宜地巩固去年改变耕作制度的成绩，对去年改得不当的应进行合理调整，有条件改制的土地可因地制宜适当扩大，并要积极推广以密植为中心的各项作物的栽培技术。在林业生产方面主要加强对现有林木的保护管理，杜绝山林火灾；提高造林技术，提倡农业社尽量作到自采、自育、自造，以保证苗木质量和大量造林的需要。在渔业生产方面要大力改进生产工具和技术，推行多种工具轮作兼作，做到常年生产。
    劳动模范代表们还认为要争取全面增产，必须坚决执行民主办社和勤俭办社的方针。
    这次大会，是在8日到16日举行的。到会的八百多名农、林、渔业和水利劳动模范代表，大部分是在合作化第一年涌现的。
