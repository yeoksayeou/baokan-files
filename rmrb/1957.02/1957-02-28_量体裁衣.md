	A construction enterprise's production base serves the construction enterprise, and its historical mission will end with the completion and commissioning of the construction enterprise. Therefore, its lifespan is short, about one or two years for some, and no more than one or two decades for others. Precisely because its lifespan is not very long, its construction scale only needs to basically meet the construction needs of the construction enterprise; otherwise, it will waste manpower and materials and increase costs.
	We have an old saying in China, "tailoring clothes to the figure." The construction of a construction enterprise's production base should also be "tailored to the figure," that is, determining its construction scale and development steps based on the scale of the construction projects of the construction enterprise and the needs of the project progress. In line with the spirit of national streamlining and economization, the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry considered the needs of the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Steel, reduced some new construction and expansion projects of production bases that were temporarily not needed, merged some construction units of production bases that could be merged, and reduced some production base project costs that could be reduced, saving the country 20 million yuan. This approach is worth learning and referencing by other key projects.

### “量体裁衣”

    “量体裁衣”
    建筑企业生产基地是为建筑企业服务的，它将随着建筑企业的完工投入生产而结束它的历史使命。因此它的寿命，短的大约一、二年，长的不过一、二十年。正因为它的寿命不很长，所以它的建设规模只要基本上可以满足建筑企业的建设需要就行了，否则就会浪费人力物力，加大成本。
    我国有句古话“量体裁衣”，建筑企业生产基地的建设也应该“量体裁衣”，即根据建筑企业建设工程的规模和工程进展的需要，决定自己的建设规模和发展步骤。冶金工业部建筑局根据国家精简节约的精神，考虑了武钢、包钢建设的需要，削减了一些暂时不需要的新建扩建生产基地建设项目，合并了一些可以合并的生产基地建设单位，降低了一些可降低的生产基地工程造价，给国家避免了两千万元的浪费。这种做法值得其他重点工程学习和参考。
