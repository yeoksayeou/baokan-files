    Measles Patients Can See a Doctor Without Leaving Home
    Recently, many families in Shanghai's Changbai New Village have noticed small white wooden boxes appearing in front of their doors. These have been set up by the Changbai New Village Children's Healthcare Center to make treatment more convenient for children with measles. If a child in a household has measles, all they need to do is write a small note and drop it in the box. Regardless of wind or snow, the doctor will come to the door with a medical kit to provide treatment the next day.
    Last year, joint clinics, health centers, and children's healthcare centers throughout Shanghai widely implemented the "measles house call" method, enabling children with measles who are sensitive to the wind to receive medical attention without having to leave home.

    麻疹患者不出门就能看病
    上海长白新村好多人家门前最近出现了一种白色的小木箱。这是长白新村儿童保健所为了便利麻疹儿童治疗而设置的。哪家小孩如果患了麻疹，只要写张小纸条丢在箱子里，不管刮风下雪，医生明天就带着药箱来登门治疗。
    上海全市的联合诊所、卫生所和儿童保健所去年普遍推行“麻疹出诊”办法，使得怕吹风的患麻疹儿童不必出门就诊。
