    Words of a New Recruit
    Zhao Feng
        (1) Coming to the army from the countryside, entering a new home from my old home, besides my parents' instructions, I also brought calluses on my hands.
        (2) ... One night when I was nine years old, under the bright moonlight, I learned to make straw sandals with my mother, and blood blisters rose on my hands. While watching, I thought, "This is the first time I've grown calluses." I thought of my parents' calloused hands, which supported the whole family; if I make some straw sandals to sell, wouldn't I be able to help a little... As I grew older, my father taught me to chop firewood, shovel the ground, and handle the plow; I gradually learned the field work, and the calluses increased year by year...
        (3) That night I signed up for the army, right in the courtyard where I learned to make straw sandals ten years ago,
    (Where now a tile-roofed house stands,
    Serving as the agricultural cooperative's office.) After signing up, I walked home, talking to the moon in my heart: Enlist for three or five years, intensify my gun handling and bayonet practice; if the enemy dares to invade, my calloused hands will never spare them. – We who rise from labor, understand best how to defend our country and protect our homes.
        (4) ... Since coming to the army a few months ago, I learn whatever the leader teaches; handling guns, lifting weights, climbing ropes... new calluses have grown on my old calluses. I'm so happy I don't know what to do, and I quickly wrote a letter home. My parents wrote back, saying, "It's good that you haven't forgotten what you said when you joined the army!"

    新兵的话
    照峰
        （一）从农村来到部队，从老家走进新家，除了双老的嘱咐，手上还带来老茧巴。
        （二）……九岁那年一个夜晚，在白净的月光下，我跟妈妈学打草鞋，双手搓起血疙瘩。一面看着一面想：“这是第一次长茧巴。”我想起双老的老茧手，劳动养活全家；我打点草鞋去卖，不也能帮点忙呐……年岁大了些，父亲教我砍柴铲地掌犁耙；田土活路慢慢学会了，茧子一年年在增加……
        （三）那天夜晚应征报名，就在十年前学打草鞋的院坝，
    （而今那里盖起瓦屋，
    做农业社办公室呐。）报完名往家里走，对着月亮我心里说着话：参军三年或五年，加紧操枪练刺杀；敌人敢来侵犯，我这茧手绝不饶它。——劳动起家的啊，最懂得怎样卫国保家。
        （四）……来到部队几个月，首长教啥我学啥；操枪、练杠、爬吊绳……老茧手长起了新茧巴。高兴得不知怎样好，连忙写信告诉家。双老写来回信说：“算你还好，没忘记参军那阵说的话！”
