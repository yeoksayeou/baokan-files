Stepping into the Meteorology Pavilion, one is greeted by a large diorama – a miniature of the earth and sky. On one side, the sky is clear after rain, with a rainbow stretching across the horizon; on the other, thunderstorms rage with lightning flashing. Facing this scene, many childhood stories about the God of Thunder would suddenly flood back into memory. Of course, no one believes in a real God of Thunder anymore; but "unexpected storms arise in the sky" is still a concern for many. However, after visiting the entire Meteorology Pavilion, the belief that wind and clouds can be predicted and disasters can be avoided will be strengthened.

Here are ten paintings depicting examples of how weather forecasting helps agricultural and pastoral production.

In early August last year, China was hit by a strong typhoon. The twelfth-grade typhoon landed near Haimen, Zhejiang, and did not dissipate until near Kaifeng, Henan. This was one of the most impactful typhoons to hit China in recent decades. The meteorological observatory made accurate forecasts, allowing many places to make proper arrangements in advance and reduce losses. Anhui Province mobilized farmers to harvest 2.34 million mu of early rice and took typhoon-proof measures for immature crops, thus avoiding huge losses when the typhoon passed. …

There are also many electric charts and models that tell people: how weather observers observe and record daily weather changes, what rules forecasters use to predict future weather, how various disasters are formed, …

China is an agricultural country, and our ancestors have accumulated a lot of meteorological knowledge in their struggle against nature for thousands of years. In the Comprehensive Pavilion are displayed the oldest meteorological data in China: a piece of Shang Dynasty oracle bone recording the weather changes at that time; and a bronze bird, the earliest wind vane. The Meteorology Pavilion also displays a map of the twenty-four solar terms from more than 2,000 years ago, which marks the natural conditions of each solar term and what agricultural work should be done at this time. This is the accumulation of many years of experience by the ancients, and Chinese farmers still use it as a basis for agricultural activities. However, China has a vast territory and the temperature difference between north and south is very large. Of course, one map of solar terms cannot be suitable for all regions. Meteorological workers have checked the meteorological data and agricultural activities of various places over the years and compared them with the twenty-four solar terms map. They discovered an interesting fact: the information recorded on the twenty-four solar terms map is only suitable for the Yellow River Basin. It is not applicable in other regions. For example, "Qingming ends snow, Guyu ends frost" is a popular agricultural saying in many parts of China, but in a chart below the solar terms map, we see that this sentence has great limitations. The chart indicates that only Beijing and Kaifeng and other places happen to have "Guyu" ending frost. In the Northeast, there is still frost during "Guyu," while in the south of the Yangtze River, there is mostly no frost before "Guyu." - This just shows that the Yellow River Basin is the cradle of our nation's culture.

There is a very unique national map in the Meteorology Pavilion. Many small display windows are opened on the map, and the scenery of several regions appears before people's eyes at the same time. It is the Qingming season, but the scenery varies greatly from place to place. The guide starts the button, and we look from north to south: farmers in the Northeast are preparing the land for sowing; spring plowing has generally begun in North China, and wheat seedlings are returning to green and heading; further south, in the Central China region, we see a green field, with wheat flowering and seedlings growing vigorously; while in the southernmost part of our country, rice has already been transplanted. The map also indicates the temperature and rainfall in various places. Careful people can discover a common sense that is often overlooked here: it turns out that not every place in the north of our country is colder than the south. From the east, the temperature gradually decreases from south to north; but in the west, the lowest temperature in Lhasa is minus 15 degrees Celsius, the lowest temperature in Chengdu is only minus 4 degrees, and a high temperature of 47.6 degrees has been recorded in Turpan, Xinjiang. The excellent climatic conditions make China a country rich in products. It is said that there are more than 2,000 kinds of edible plants in our country.

The work of the meteorological observatory is not only to forecast the future weather for everyone every day. They also continuously record and organize the meteorological data of various places throughout the year to serve various departments of economic construction. Building factories, building railways, afforestation, and building reservoirs all require meteorological data, and leading agricultural production cannot do without it. Anhui Province's "Three Changes" plan was proposed with reference to local meteorological data. The agricultural department of East China has planned which areas are winter wheat areas, which areas are spring wheat areas, and where are semi-winter wheat areas based on meteorological data. The Meteorology Pavilion exhibits a lot of materials in this regard. There are also two attractive small pictures, one is "Why does Northeast soybeans have less pod formation in Anhui?" and the other is "Why does 'Aomori No. 5' rice in Yanbian not grow well in Hunan?" There is a comparison of temperature, rainfall, and sunshine in the two places on the picture. Agricultural technicians will gain a lot of inspiration here.

In the second half of the Meteorology Pavilion, we see an overview of China's meteorological work in recent years. On a map, at first, dozens of green dots appear sparsely, which is the distribution of meteorological observatories and stations during the Kuomintang rule; then a large network composed of thousands of red dots appears, which is the meteorological network built in the past few years after liberation. The number of meteorological observatories and stations built in 1956 is almost equal to the total number of stations built in the previous few years before 1955. In 1949, meteorological work had only two main businesses, and it was still impossible to fully grasp the laws of weather changes; now it has been able to publicly broadcast national meteorological information and forecasts, and the main businesses have also increased to nineteen.

These achievements are still far from meeting the needs of actual work and the advanced level of the world; China's meteorological workers are working hard to move forward. The "Further Exploration of the Atmosphere" diorama shows the direction of China's meteorological work. The most advanced instruments are placed on the ground, hanging in the air, and floating on the water, including unmanned automatic weather stations, floating stations, and radar, rockets.... In the future, the situation from the high altitude of more than 50 kilometers all the way to the bottom of the sea must be clearly explored. There is a group of paintings near the exit of the Meteorology Pavilion, indicating that scientists are studying how to use manpower to dissipate clouds, eliminate fog, cause rain, and eliminate hail. Meteorological workers not only want to peek through the secrets of nature, but also want to be people who can "call the wind and summon the rain."

    预测风云　防灾增产
    ——记全国农业展览会气象馆
    王一平
    走进气象馆，迎面就是一个大布景箱——可算得是大地和天空的缩影。天空一边是雨霁天晴，彩虹万里；另一边是雷雨交加，电光闪闪。面对着这幅图景，童年时代听过的许多关于雷公的故事一下子都会涌到记忆里来。现在当然没有人再相信真有雷公了；但“天有不测风云”仍然是很多人所担心的事，可是，当你参观了全部气象馆以后，风云可以预测、灾害可能避免的信念就更加增强了。
    这里有十幅画，描绘了预测天气帮助农牧业生产的实例。
    去年8月初，我国遭到强台风的袭击，十二级的台风在浙江海门附近登陆，直到河南开封附近才消失。这是近几十年来对我国影响最大的一次台风。气象台作了准确的预报，使得许多地方能够在事先作妥善的安排，减少了损失。安徽省动员农民抢收了二百三十四万亩早稻，又对没有成熟的庄稼采取了防台措施，因而在台风过境的时候，避免了巨大的损失。……
    这里还有许多电动图表和模型，它们告诉人们：气象侦察员怎样观察和记录每天的天气变化，预报员又根据什么规律推测未来的天气，各种灾害是怎样形成的，……
    我国是个农业国，我们的祖先几千年以来在同大自然作斗争中积蓄了不少的气象知识。在综合馆陈列着我国最古的气象资料：一块商代的甲骨上记载着当时天气变化的情况；还有一只相风铜鸟，是最早的风向仪。气象馆里还陈列着两千多年前的二十四节气图，那上面标明了每个节令的自然情况以及在这个时候该做那些农活。这是古人多少年经验的积累，我国农民至今还在以它作为农事活动的依据。但是我国土地辽阔，南北气温相差很大，一个节气图当然不可能适合各地的情况，气象工作者们查了各地历年的气象资料和农事活动情况，同二十四节气图作比较，他们发现了一个有趣的事：二十四节气图上记录的情况只在黄河流域一带适合，到别的地方就讲不通了。像“清明断雪、谷雨断霜”是我国许多地方流传的农谚，可是在节气图下面的一幅图表中，我们看到这句话是有很大局限性的，图上标明只有北京和开封等地恰好是“谷雨”断霜，在东北地区“谷雨”仍有霜冻，而在长江以南，大都不到“谷雨”就没有霜冻了。——这正说明了：黄河流域是我们民族文化的摇篮。
    气象馆里有一幅很别致的全国地图，图上开着许多小橱窗，几个地区的景色一齐出现在人们眼前。同是清明时节，各地景色却大不相同。讲解员开动电钮，我们从北往南看：东北的农民正在整地选种；华北已普遍开始春耕，麦苗也返青抽穗了；再往南，在华中地区就看到田野里一片青绿，小麦扬花、秧苗茁壮；而在我国的最南部却早已插完秧了。图上还标明了各地的温度和雨量。细心的人在这里能发现一个常常被人忽略的常识：原来我国并不是任何一处北方都比南方冷。从东部看，温度是由南向北逐渐减低的；可是在西部，拉萨的最低温度是摄氏零下十五度，成都的最低温度只有零下四度，而在新疆的吐鲁番还曾出现过四十七度六的高温记录。优良的气候条件，使我国成为一个物产丰富的国家。据说我国可吃的植物就有两千多种。
    气象台的工作，不光是每天向大家预报未来的天气。他们还终年不断地记录、整理各地的气象资料，为经济建设的各个部门服务。盖工厂、修铁路、造林、筑水库都不能缺少气象资料，领导农业生产更是离不了它。安徽省的“三改”计划，就是参考了当地的气象资料提出来的。华东的农业部门，根据气象资料规划出来哪些地方是冬麦区、哪些地方是春麦区、哪里是半冬麦区。气象馆里展出了不少这方面的材料。还有两幅吸引人的小图，一是“东北大豆在安徽为什么结荚少？”一是“延边的‘青森五号’水稻在湖南为什么长不好？”图上有两地温度、雨量、日照的对比。农业技术工作者在这里将得到不少的启发。
    在气象馆的后半部分，看到了我国近几年气象工作的一个概貌。一幅地图上起初出现疏疏落落几十个绿点，是国民党统治时期的气象台、站分布情况；接着出现了一张由成千个红色圆点组成的大网，这是解放后几年中建成的气象网，其中1956年所建的气象台、站，就差不多等于1955年以前几年建站数字的总和。1949年气象工作只有两项主要业务，还不能完全掌握天气变化的规律；现在已经能够公开广播全国气象情报预报了，主要业务也增加到十九项。
    这些成绩距离实际工作的需要和世界先进水平还差得很远；我国的气象工作者正在奋力前进。在“进一步探测大气层”这个布景箱展示了我国气象工作的方向。那里地上放的、空中挂的、水上漂的全是最先进的仪器，有无人自动气象站、水上漂浮站、还有雷达、火箭……。将来从五十公里以上的高空一直到海底的情况，都要探测清楚。气象馆出口处附近有一组画，表明科学家正在研究用人力来排云、消雾、降雨、消灭冰雹。气象工作者不但要窥破自然的秘密，还要做“呼风唤雨”的人。
