    Changed My Bad Temper in Running the Cooperative
    ——An Interview with Gao Mingzhong, Delegate to the National Model Agricultural Laborers Representative Conference
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Feng Jianwei
    Gao Mingzhong, the representative from Shanxi Province attending the National Model Agricultural Laborers Representative Conference, is a good cadre who always listens to the opinions of the masses, relies on everyone in everything, and therefore runs a large cooperative of more than 1,000 households well. His model deeds in leading the cooperative are widely circulated in the Jinan area of Shanxi Province.
    Gao Mingzhong worked as a hired laborer for most of his life, and the impoverished living environment made him develop a violent temper. In the past, when he worked for the Farmers' Association and the village government, he would get angry and quarrel with people if they didn't agree with him. At that time, everyone in the village feared him. However, since 1953, when he began leading the cooperative, he gradually learned to restrain his personality, discuss things with people, and especially after the transition to a large-scale advanced cooperative with more than 1,300 households last year, his temper has undergone a major change.
    Establishing a Sound Democratic Management System
    Last spring, when the advanced cooperative was first established, more than 5,000 people's farm work had to be arranged every day, the feeding of more than 690 livestock had to be managed, and the complex issues of pricing production materials as shares and the large-scale water conservancy construction projects underway at that time had to be resolved. One after another, people came to the cooperative director, batch after batch. Gao Mingzhong was not annoyed by these problems, but always acted according to the rules he had set for himself: the cooperative belongs to everyone, and I can't let my temper ruin the cooperative's affairs. Gao Mingzhong thought that to manage such a large household well, everything must be done well, and first of all, we must rely on the leading cadres. At the beginning, he led the management committee to establish a democratic management and division of labor responsibility system, and focused on inspiring the enthusiasm of the cadres in two aspects. One is not to hold unprepared meetings, and to solve problems at meetings. The second is not to act subjectively and arbitrarily, but to give cadres the opportunity to发挥their talents. Once, the cooperative planned to install a large number of cotton gins. At that time, he and most of the cadres agreed, but Dong Linjiang and other six people couldn't understand. At this time, Gao Mingzhong did not decide to implement it according to the usual practice of passing it by a majority vote. Instead, he patiently consulted with these six cadres four or five times until everyone agreed before making a decision. Due to the full play of democracy among the leading cadres and the implementation of collective leadership, dozens of cadres in the whole cooperative have established a strong sense of work responsibility. Gao Mingzhong was also able to jump out of the circle of busy affairs and often go deep into the fields and visit the families of the members door to door.
    Gao Mingzhong also paid great attention to cultivating the democratic style of leading cadres. He often educated cooperative affairs cadres to listen to the opinions of cooperative members at any time and improve leadership work. Cooperative affairs cadres gladly accepted his teachings. When they discovered the inventions of cooperative members Yang Qingxiu, who modified wooden waterwheels into gear waterwheels, and Tang Yucheng, who modified hand-cranked waterwheels into foot-operated waterwheels, the management committee immediately organized the modification of more than 90 waterwheels, increasing irrigation efficiency by five to seven times. When the management committee dealt with issues concerning the vital interests of cooperative members, especially when leaders and cooperative members had conflicts of opinion, Gao Mingzhong did not allow it to be rashly decided and implemented, even if the management committee's opinion was very correct. At this time, he personally went to repeatedly negotiate with the cooperative members. Therefore, the management committee enjoys a high reputation and prestige in the minds of the cooperative members. Every resolution made by the management committee can be supported and resolutely implemented by the vast number of cooperative members.
    Helping to Improve the Leadership of Production Teams
    The cooperative members still remember Gao Mingzhong's tireless efforts to help improve the leadership of the production teams, making the labor order of the whole cooperative normal. After the expansion into an advanced cooperative last year, the production teams had more people and horses, and the situation was complicated. The team leaders had no experience, and there was a period of confusion in the allocation of work and division of labor. Based on this situation, Gao Mingzhong went deep into the thirteenth production team, which had more problems, to find out the situation. At that time, the whole team's farm work could not be allocated, some cooperative members were lazy and slippery, and the quality of work was not good. The team leader Zhang Maosheng complained that being a team leader would shorten his life by ten years and clamored to resign. After Gao Mingzhong came to the team, he conducted education on honest labor to the cooperative members and solved the problems of labor division and work points in the delivery of manure. At the same time, he considered improving the leadership methods of the production team. With his painstaking research and the help of the team cadres and accountants, he created a method of using charts to direct production. The team used one chart to list the types of farm work and progress plans for the current period, and another chart to record the labor situation. Then, based on these two aspects, they arranged farm work and divided labor. In this way, the affairs of the production team leader were greatly reduced, the arrangement of farm work was very simple, the confusion in the allocation of labor was overcome, and the labor efficiency of the whole team quickly increased by more than 20%. Later, Gao Mingzhong asked the cadres of each team to learn from the experience of the thirteenth team, and the leadership of each production team in the whole cooperative generally went on track.
    Go Wherever There is Difficulty
    Last summer, just when the Liaoyuan Cooperative was busy with weeding, harvesting wheat, and summer planting, it rained heavily for more than 40 days in a row. There was a lot of work to be done in the fields and on the threshing grounds, but it was difficult to start. The cooperative members were anxiously scratching their heads. At this time, Gao Mingzhong consulted experienced farmers and decided not to wait any longer. He immediately led the cooperative members to rush to harvest the autumn seedlings at night and move the wheat to each house during the day to turn it over, dry it, and thresh it. During this most stressful period, Gao Mingzhong did not sleep soundly. Sometimes he ran ten miles or so in the dark of night to guide production in various teams and check the rain-proof equipment for wheat stacks. If he found any problems, he immediately worked with the cooperative members to solve them. Under his timely and accurate guidance, the autumn seedlings of the whole cooperative were not abandoned, and more than 1.3 million catties of wheat were also reduced from mold and spoilage. The cooperative members still give a thumbs up and praise Director Gao for being wise when they mention this matter.
    Consulting Advisors
    Gao Mingzhong knows that the key to running an agricultural cooperative well is to grow crops well and increase cotton and grain production. But his own experience in growing crops is not rich enough. Therefore, whenever the cooperative has difficult problems, he visits experienced old farmers to ask for advice. During the continuous drizzle last summer, weeds were rampant in the cotton seedling fields, pests were rampant, and the wheat was also transported to the threshing grounds waiting to be threshed, and labor could not be allocated. Gao Mingzhong braved the rain to discuss with Zhang Fang and other six old men. The old farmers told him that as long as the wheat in the threshing ground is tightly covered with wheat straw, it will be fine for ten or eight days. If the autumn seedlings are delayed for two or three days, they will be abandoned, and they said that they would be responsible for the rain-proof work on the threshing ground and free up the young people to go to the fields to work. The problem that Gao Mingzhong had been worried about day and night was immediately solved by the old farmers. Since then, he has paid more attention to the opinions of the old farmers. Whenever he formulates production plans and arranges farm work, he always has a discussion with the old farmers first. Later, he also specially organized an old farmer technical guidance group, which became a famous "cooperative director's advisory group."
    Gao Mingzhong is the director of the Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province. He grew up in a hired peasant's family and is a well-known labor expert in the village. Since liberation, he has been elected as a labor model of Jieyu County and Shanxi Province for many years. Last year, after the Liaoyuan Agricultural Cooperative he led was converted into a large-scale advanced cooperative with more than 1,300 households, it relied on the strength of the masses to overcome natural disasters and finally achieved an all-round bumper harvest of grain and cotton. The total output value of the whole cooperative exceeded more than six times that of 1955, and 97% of the households in the cooperative increased their income. In the process of establishing an advanced cooperative, Gao Mingzhong also learned a democratic leadership style in running the cooperative, which won the support of all cooperative members. To this day, no household in the whole cooperative says Gao Mingzhong is not good.

    在办社中改掉了坏脾气
    ——访出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议代表高鸣钟
    新华社记者　冯建伟
    出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的山西省代表高鸣钟，是一位时时听取群众意见，处处依靠大家，因而办好了一个一千多户的大社的好干部。他领导办社的模范事迹在山西省晋南地区广泛流传着。
    高鸣钟当了大半辈子雇工，贫困的生活环境，使他养成一种暴躁的脾气。过去作农会和村政府工作时，话不投机就和人发火，大吵大闹起来。当时村里人谁都惧他三分。但是，自从1953年领导办社以来，他慢慢学会了抑制自己的个性，遇事和人商量，特别是去年转办成一千三百多户的大型高级社以后，他的脾气就有了大转变。
    健全民主管理制度
    去年春天高级社刚成立时，每天要安排五千多人的农活，六百九十多头牲口的吃喝，还要解决生产资料作价入股和当时进行大规模水利建设工程中纷纭复杂的问题。一个接一个的发生，找社长的人送去一伙又一伙，高鸣钟对这些问题没有恼火，总是按着自己给自己定下的规则去办：社是大家的，不能叫自己的脾气坏了全社的事。高鸣钟想，要使这么大户家庭，样样事都办好，首先得依靠领导干部。开始他就领导管理委员会建立民主管理和分工负责的制度，并且着重从两个方面去启发干部们的积极性。一是不滥开没准备的会议，开会就解决问题。二是自己不主观专断办事，让干部有发挥才能的机会。有一次社里计划安装大批轧花机，当时他和多数干部都同意了，唯独董林江等六人想不通。这时，高鸣钟没有按往常的习惯多数通过就决定执行。而是耐心地和这六位干部磋商了四五次，直到全体通过才作出决定。由于充分发挥了领导干部之间的民主，实行了集体领导，使全社数十个干部都树立了很强的工作责任心。高鸣钟也就从繁忙的事务圈子中跳出来，能够经常深入田间，逐户访问社员家庭。
    高鸣钟还很注意培养领导干部的民主作风。他经常教育社务干部随时听取社员意见，改进领导工作。社务干部都欣然接受他的教导，在发现社员杨清秀改装木水车为齿轮水车，唐玉成改装手摇水车为脚踏水车的创造发明时，管理委员会立即组织改装了九十多部水车，使灌溉效率提高五倍到七倍。在管理委员会处理有关社员切身利害问题时，特别是领导干部和社员发生意见冲突的时候，哪怕管理委员会的意见十分正确，高鸣钟也不许冒然决定推行。这时，他就亲自去和社员反复协商。因此，管理委员会在社员心目中，享有崇高的信誉和威望。管理委员会作的每一个决议，都能得到广大社员的拥护和坚决执行。
    帮助改进生产队的领导
    高鸣钟废寝忘食地帮助改进生产队的领导，使全社劳动秩序正常的事迹，至今社员们还念念不忘。去年扩建成高级社后，各生产队人马多，情况复杂，队的领导干部没经验，曾一度出现派活分工上的混乱现象。根据这种情况，高鸣钟便深入到问题较多的第十三生产队去摸情况。当时，全队农活分派不开，某些社员偷懒耍滑，做活不讲质量，队长张茂盛发牢骚说当队长少活十年，吵着要辞职；高鸣钟来到队里以后，一面向社员进行诚实劳动的教育，解决送粪中劳动分工和计工问题，一面考虑改进生产队领导方法。在他苦心孤诣的钻研和队干部、会计们的帮助下，创造了用图表指挥生产的办法。队里用一张图表列开当前一个时期的农活种类、进度计划，用另一张图表记载劳力状况，然后依据这两方面的情况安排农活和进行劳动分工。这样，生产队长的事务大大减少，农活安排十分简便，克服了劳动力调配上的混乱现象，全队劳动效率很快提高20％多。后来，高鸣钟又请各队干部学习第十三队的经验，全社各生产队的领导普遍走向轨道。
    哪里困难到哪里去
    去年夏季，正当燎原社锄苗、收麦、夏播活儿忙的很紧时，一连下了四十多天大雨。地里、场上有很多活要做，眼瞅着不能下手干，社员们焦急得直搔头皮。这时高鸣钟请教了有经验的农民，便决定不再等待，立即带领社员们，黑夜突击收拾秋苗，白天把小麦搬到各家屋子里去翻晾和脱粒。在这个最紧张的时期，高鸣钟没有睡过囫囵觉。有时一夜摸黑跑十来里地，到各队去指导生产，检查麦垛防雨设备，发现问题，立即和社员一齐动手解决。在他的及时准确的指导下，全社秋苗没有荒芜，一百三十多万斤小麦，也减免了霉烂损失，社员们提起这件事，至今还伸出大拇指称赞高主任英明。
    请顾问
    高鸣钟知道办好农业社的关键是把庄稼种好，增加棉粮生产。但自己对种庄稼的经验还不够丰富。因此，每当社里发生疑难问题时，他便去拜访有经验的老农民，向他们讨教。还是在去年夏季霪雨连绵的日子，棉苗田里杂草丛生，害虫猖狂，小麦也运到场上等着打，劳动力调配不开了。高鸣钟冒雨去和张坊等六个老汉商量。老农们告诉他：场里小麦只要用麦秸盖严，放个十天八天的没事。秋苗耽误两三天就会荒坏，并且表示负责麦场上的防雨工作，腾出年轻人下地干活。高鸣钟日夜愁苦的问题，马上被老农排解开了。从此，他更加重视老农们的意见。每当制订生产计划、安排农活时，他总是先和老农座谈。后来又专门组织了老农技术指导组，成了有名的“社长顾问团”。
    高鸣钟是山西省解虞县燎原农业社主任，从小生长在一个雇农家里，是村里有名的劳动能手。解放以来，他曾连年当选为解虞县和山西省的劳动模范。去年，他领导的燎原农业社转建成一千三百多户的大型高级社后，依靠群众力量战胜了自然灾害，终于获得粮棉全面丰收。全社总产值超过1955年六倍多，社内有97％的户增加了收入。在创办高级社的过程中，高鸣钟也学会了民主办社的领导作风，博得全体社员拥护，至今全社没有一户不说高鸣钟好的。
