    In Tongxin Township, Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, almost everyone knows about the deeds of Li Benyun, a Communist Party member who participated in the 25,000-li Long March. He maintains the tradition of hard work and struggles, actively participates in agricultural production, and closely connects with the masses.

    When I visited him on January 17, he was returning from picking grass on the Huanghai Beach, dozens of miles away. From his appearance, he looked exactly like a simple, honest local farmer.

    Li Benyun is from Langzhong County, Sichuan Province. He herded cattle for landlords from a young age. In 1933, at the age of fourteen, he joined the Red Army, and at fifteen, he joined the Communist Party. During the 25,000-li Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, he fought in thirteen provinces, participated in twenty-four major battles, and countless smaller ones that he can't even remember. He climbed snow-capped mountains, crossed grasslands, ate grass roots and leather belts, experienced countless hardships, and earned two major merits in battle. He suffered twelve wounds all over his body, and to this day, a bullet is still lodged in his chest, and a tea-cup-sized hole in his left hip has not healed. In the army, he rose from soldier, squad leader, platoon leader, and company commander to battalion commander. In 1946, he was seriously injured in a battle in northern Jiangsu and recuperated in Tongxin Township, Sheyang County. He fell in love with this place, and after being demobilized, he stayed here to settle down, establish a career, and participate in agricultural production. People here still call him "Old Battalion Commander."

    For ten years, Li Benyun has been arranging his life in the local area in the style of an old Red Army soldier. When he first came down from the army to recuperate, his superiors sent two orderlies to take care of him. At that time, it was during the difficult situation of the Kuomintang's frantic offensive. Li Benyun thought that the front lines needed people, and soon sent one orderly back to the army. When his wound healed slightly, he sent the other one away as well. At that time, this orderly said, "The situation is so difficult, the Party sent me to take care of you, I can't leave." Li Benyun said, "One more person on the front line is one more strength. Obey the order, go!" In order to reduce the burden on the people and not require supplies from the state, he supported himself by selling sesame cakes, cigarettes, and needles and thread. Later, thinking that it was not appropriate for a Communist Party member to do business, he devoted himself to agricultural production.

    Tongxin Township, where he is located, is a cotton-producing area. Li Benyun had never seen anyone grow cotton in his hometown when he was a child, and he encountered great difficulties in production. But he did not retreat in the face of difficulties. He humbly learned production techniques from nearby old farmers, and after marrying a local rural girl, he also learned from his wife. At first, when he participated in production, his wound ached, so he made a small stool to bring to the field, sitting and moving around while weeding. In order not to delay production, when his wife gave birth to a child, the two of them would carry the child to the field and take care of it at the edge of the field. When local cadres and the masses saw this situation, they proposed to send someone to farm on his behalf. He said, "It is not my revolutionary purpose to have people serve me when I can work." He declined the kindness of the masses. He also took the lead in responding to the government's call to experiment with various yield-increasing measures, such as spreading raw mud on cotton fields, covering them with grass, and implementing row planting.

    During the flood prevention period in 1954, Li Benyun disregarded the pain in his wound and led people to patrol the dike day and night. Once, the dike breached, and he was the first to jump down to try to block it. The masses followed and blocked the breach, protecting more than 3,000 mu of cotton fields from being flooded. The masses said, "Thanks to Old Battalion Commander!"

    In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, from mutual aid teams and elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, Li Benyun took the lead in persuading and mobilizing his ten or so neighbors and relatives to be the first to participate. He himself actively labored in the cooperative. During the summer weeding season, he got up at midnight every day to beat the gong to wake up the members to cook and go to the fields, for more than a month. Last year, apart from the time spent in meetings and traveling, he and his wife worked two hundred and eighty workdays. Because he actively studied and took the lead in working hard in labor, he has now become a cotton planting expert.

    Li Benyun never put on the airs of a meritorious person in front of cadres and the masses. He is humble, amiable, and strictly demands himself. Some demobilized soldiers were not united with local cadres after returning to their hometowns. When he heard about it, he went to persuade them, often saying to the demobilized soldiers, "We fought in the front lines is revolution, the work of local cadres is also revolution. Speaking of merit, everyone has it. It's wrong to disrespect cadres based on merit!" He also promptly made suggestions to cadres when some families of martyrs and soldiers and demobilized soldiers did not receive proper care. He actively participated in propaganda in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, general elections, conscription propaganda, and unified purchase and sale, and took the lead in implementing the government's decisions.

    Li Benyun always saves his extra money in good harvest years, or buys public bonds, or helps neighbors in need. In famine years, he lives frugally, relying on his own efforts, and never asks the government for subsidies. During the spring famine in 1950, although he himself was very difficult, he took out a portion of wheat and lent it to more than a dozen neighbors. When the neighbors returned it to him after the new wheat came on the market, because the new wheat had a loss, they gave him a little more. He sent the extra back to the neighbors, saying, "How can a Communist Party member ask for interest when helping others solve difficulties?" Last year, the cotton of the agricultural cooperative suffered reduced production due to the typhoon, and the income decreased. His wife was also sick and hospitalized. The township People's Committee specially wrote a certificate for him, asking him to take it to the higher-level People's Committee to request a subsidy. When he arrived at the County Civil Affairs Section, there were some families of soldiers and demobilized soldiers complaining to the cadres about their difficulties. He looked at it, turned around, and took the certificate back as it was, and solved the difficulties himself by borrowing money, without asking the government for subsidies. Later, he said to the cadres who asked him about this matter, "The country needs to be built, and money is spent everywhere. Individual difficulties are always easy to solve." The cadres and members of the agricultural cooperative proposed to subsidize him some work points because he often went out to meetings. He said, "I am uneasy if I get work points without working," and has not accepted it until now. He raises some pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and rabbits at home to supplement his life. After the higher-level Party committee put forward the call that Party members should care about the suffering of the masses, he was responsible for grasping the production and disaster relief work of a production brigade, and often visited households in difficulty to arrange their production. After returning from a meeting in Beijing last December, he immediately led more than twenty people to the beach dozens of miles away to pick grass. They lived in temporary sheds built by the sea, braving the wind and snow for more than twenty days, and each person received an average of more than sixty yuan. The masses once said to him: Old Battalion Commander, you are a meritorious person, you should rest and enjoy yourself a bit! He smiled and said, "The merit belongs to Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country. Now we are building socialism, enjoyment will have to wait!"

    Because Li Benyun loves labor, closely connects with the masses, shares weal and woe with the masses, and is frugal and simple in his life, he has been elected as a representative to the township and county People's Congress in two elections. The men and women farmers of Tongxin Township praised him in unison, saying: Old Battalion Commander is really good, a good Communist Party member.

    老共产党员李本云	魏文华
    在江苏省射阳县同心乡，几乎无人不知曾经参加二万五千里长征的共产党员李本云保持艰苦奋斗的传统，在农业生产上积极劳动和他密切联系群众的事迹。
    我在1月17日去访问他时，他正从几十里外的黄海滩上拾草回来。从外表看他和当地一个朴实的农民完全一样。
    李本云是四川省阆中县人，从小为地主放牛。1933年十四岁时参加红军，十五岁时加入了共产党。在二万五千里长征、抗日战争和解放战争中，他转战十三省，参加过二十四次大的战斗，小战斗自己也记不清了。爬雪山，过草地，吃过草根皮带，经历过无数艰辛，并且在战斗中立过两次大功。全身受过十二次伤，至今胸膛里还锲着一颗子弹没有取出，左胯下一个茶杯口那样大的伤洞没有长平。在部队里他由战士、班长、排长、连长而营长。1946年他在苏北的一次战斗中受了重伤后在射阳县同心乡休养，爱上了这个地方，复员后就留在这里安家立业参加农业生产。这里的人们至今还称他为“老营长”。
    十年来，李本云在地方上一直用老红军的方式来安排自己的生活。初从部队下来休养时，上级曾派两个通讯员随同照顾他。当时正处在国民党疯狂进攻的艰苦情况下，李本云想到前方正需要人，不久就打发一个通讯员回部队去。伤口稍为好些，他又把另一个也送走，当时这个通讯员说：“情况这样困难，党要我来照顾你，我不能离开。”李本云说：“前方多一个人就多一份力量，你服从命令，去吧！”为了减轻人民负担，不要国家供给，一个人提篮卖烧饼、纸烟、针线等养活自己。后来想到共产党员做生意不合适，便全力参加农业生产。
    他所在的同心乡是个棉产区。李本云小时候在故乡没有看过人种棉花，在生产上遇到了很大困难。但是他没有在困难面前退缩，虚心地向附近的老农民学习生产技术，和当地的一个农村姑娘结婚后又向妻子学习。起初参加生产时伤口作痛，他就做了一条小板凳带到田里，坐着边移动边拔草。为了不耽误生产，妻子生了小孩，两人下田时就把小孩担到地头照料。当地的干部和群众看到这种情况，提出要派人为他代耕，他说：“我能劳动时要人侍候，这不是我革命的目的”，谢绝了群众的好意。他还带头响应政府的号召，试验各种增产措施，例如在棉田铺生泥、盖草、实行条播等。
    1954年防汛期间，李本云又不顾自己的伤口痛，带着人上堤日夜巡逻。有一次堤岸决口，他第一个跳下去抢堵，群众也跟着下去堵住决口，保护了三千多亩棉田未被水淹，群众都说：“亏了老营长！”
    在互助合作运动中，从互助组、初级社到高级社，也都是李本云带头说服动员他的十多户邻居和亲戚最先参加。他自己在社里积极劳动，夏季锄草期间，他每天半夜起来敲锣唤醒社员做饭下田，连续一个多月。去年他除了开会和外出的时间，还和妻子一道做了二百八十个劳动日。由于他在劳动中积极钻研，带头苦干，现在已经成了一个植棉能手。
    李本云在干部和群众面前从来不摆功臣架子，谦虚、和气，严格要求自己。有些复员军人回乡后和当地干部不团结，他听到了去劝解时，常对复员军人说：“我们在前方打仗是革命，地方干部工作也是革命，说功劳都是，凭功劳不尊重干部就不对了！”有些烈、军属和复员军人没有得到适当照顾，他也及时向干部们提出建议。在镇压反革命、普选、兵役宣传、统购统销等工作中，他都积极参加宣传，并带头执行政府的决定。
    李本云在丰收年景总是把多余的钱储蓄起来，或者买公债、帮助困难的邻居。在荒年他就省吃俭用，自力更生，从不向政府要求补助。1950年春荒时，他自己虽然很困难，但还拿出一部分麦子借给十多户邻居。新麦登场后邻居还他时，因为新麦有蚀耗多量了一点给他，他把多出的送回给邻居，说：“共产党员帮助别人解决困难，怎能要利息？”去年农业社棉花因受台风影响减产，收入减少了，妻子又生病住了医院，乡人民委员会特地为他写了一份证明，请他带到上级人民委员会去请求补助。他到县民政科的时候，正有一些军属和复员军人在向干部诉困难。他一看，扭转身便把证明信原封带回，自行设法借钱解决了困难，没有向政府请求补助。后来他向问起这件事的干部们说：“国家要建设，处处花钱，个人的困难总好解决。”农业社干部和社员因为他常去外面开会，提出要补贴他一些工分，他说：“我没有劳动得工分，于心不安”，至今没有接受。自己在家里养了些猪、羊、鸡、鸭、家兔等，贴补些生活。当上级党委提出党员应关心群众疾苦的号召后，他负责掌握一个生产大队的生产救灾工作，经常访问困难户，安排他们的生产。去年12月他从北京开会回来后，就立即带领了二十多人到几十里外的海滩上去拾草。他们住在海边临时搭起的草棚中，冒着风雪干了二十多天，每人平均分到了六十多元。群众曾对他说：老营长，你是有功之人，该憩憩享受点了！他笑笑说：“功是毛主席和全国人民的。现在建设社会主义，享受还要等等哩！”
    由于李本云热爱劳动，密切联系群众，同群众共甘苦，生活上艰苦朴素，两次选举，他都被选为乡和县的人民代表大会代表。同心乡的男女农民都异口同声地称赞他说：老营长真好，是一个好共产党员。
