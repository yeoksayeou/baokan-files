    Auntie Agou Takes an Airplane
    Shen Weipeng
    Li Zhaoda is a leaf-stripping worker in Workshop One of the Shanghai Huacheng Cigarette Factory. Many people don't know her real name, but call her "Auntie Agou." Auntie Agou is a famous figure in the factory. She is known for her slow work. Generally, a leaf-stripping worker has to strip about 90 jin of tobacco leaves a day, while Auntie Agou doing a maximum of 40 jin is considered remarkable.

    Half a month ago, the female workers elected representatives to go to the Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 4 to observe the operation method of labor model Lü Azhen. Someone told Auntie Agou upon returning: "Auntie Agou! Lü Azhen strips leaves unbelievably fast! She produces 200 jin a day, and the quality is excellent. Our workshop is also having a labor competition. You only do 30 or 40 jin a day, and you might even have to,pour the night soil'. Continuing like this isn't a good thing, you have to try harder and learn." Auntie Agou frowned and said, "Alas! An old woman in her fifties, my hands are stiff, unlike you young girls who can exert strength. I can't learn it."

    This day, the lunch bell rang in Workshop One, and the female workers quickly finished their meals, full of joy. Red flags were hung in the workshop, as lively as a wedding. Some female workers even went to the factory gate to wait. Wait for whom? Wait for Lü Azhen. It turned out that this labor model came to the factory today to demonstrate her operation method. Lü Azhen is here! Her operating table was surrounded by people, head upon head, some even climbed onto the tables. Auntie Agou had long heard about this, and she thought to herself: "People strip so fast, mainly because they use brute force. There's nothing special about that. Little Mei in our workshop produces more than 140 jin a day. Look, she's built like a tar barrel, working fiercely, with sweat pouring down." Seeing how lively it was today, with comrades from the technology section and the branch secretary present, Auntie Agou thought, "Whether I watch or not, it's like not watching, let me take a look!" After squeezing into the crowd, her eyes were stuck like magnets, staring at Lü Azhen's light and agile operation. "How? So fast! And so clean and neat. Her hands are as flexible and easy as playing the piano, not like Little Mei who uses dead strength. This operation really makes sense." So she squeezed to the front, watching until the end.

    After work, Auntie Agou returned home and sat on the edge of the bed, sewing soles, her mind always lingering on Lü Azhen's operation method. She saw that the thread had to pass through the thick sole, and her hands had to use both soft and hard skills. Just relying on brute force was useless. The thread wouldn't pass through, and might even break on the sole. "Stripping tobacco leaves is the same. Relying on brute force is useless. As long as you master the operation. Lü Azhen doesn't use much effort and can strip the leaves well. My old woman doesn't have enough strength, no need to worry, as long as I learn the technique, I'm sure to increase production." Then she thought, "Learning the technique isn't a matter of a day or two. My old woman's hands aren't as flexible as a young girl's, don't embarrass myself, forget it!"

    Two days later, Auntie Agou heard that many people had increased their production after learning the new operation method. What she was particularly concerned about was that Little Mei had also learned the new operation method. Now Little Mei's posture was natural when working, using less brute force, but her output had increased by 5 percent. Auntie Agou still didn't quite believe it. In the afternoon, she stripped two handfuls of tobacco leaves, took an enamel cup, pretending to pour tea at the factory gate, passed through the leaf-stripping alley, really wanting to see how Little Mei was operating. Looking! It was indeed good, not only was that fierce and ugly state gone, but even her forehead, which had always been covered with sweat, was smooth and without urgent sweat. Auntie Agou returned to her seat, and the young worker Shi Ying jokingly asked her, "Auntie Agou, you went out to pour tea, walked around the workshop, and saw how people operate, you must have learned a lot of advanced experience!" Auntie Agou hurriedly replied, "Nothing! Nothing?" But she started to do it according to Lü Azhen's operation method in her hands. Shi Ying saw it at a glance, almost bursting out laughing, and then said, "Right! Do it like this, slightly raise your arm...". Strangely enough, Auntie Agou used to feel like she had tied ten jin of iron blocks to her arms after stripping ten jin of leaves, heavy and tiring, but now, she stripped thirty jin of tobacco leaves in an afternoon, and didn't feel tired at all, her arms were like they had wings, smooth and flexible.

    Today, Workshop One is lively again, as if celebrating a wedding. Comrades from the technology section came, the Party branch secretary came, and even the head cook from the kitchen came to join in the fun, congratulating Auntie Agou for increasing her production by 60 percent after learning the new operation method. Everyone said, "Auntie Agou is as fast as taking an airplane!"

    阿狗娘乘飞机
    沈伟鹏
    李招大是上海华成烟厂一车间的扯叶女工，许多人都不知道她的真名实姓，却称她“阿狗娘”。阿狗娘在厂里是个鼎鼎大名的人物，她出名在活儿做得慢，一般扯叶女工一天要扯九十来斤烟叶，而阿狗娘最多扯四十斤烟叶已经算了不起。
    半月前，女工们推选代表到上烟四厂去观摩劳动模范吕阿珍操作法，回来有人告诉阿狗娘说：“阿狗娘！吕阿珍扯叶子真快得不得了！一天产量二百斤，而且质量呱呱叫。我们车间里也在劳动竞赛，你一天只做三、四十斤，弄得不巧还要，倒夜壶’，一直下去总不是事情，也得加把油学习学习。”阿狗娘眉头皱紧说：“唉！五十多岁的老太婆，手骨死僵僵的，不像你们年青姑娘使得出力，学不像了。”
    这天，一车间放饭工铃响，女工们都赶紧吃完饭，喜气洋洋。车间里挂上红旗，就像办喜事般热闹，有的女工还特地到厂门口去候。候谁？候吕阿珍。原来这位劳动模范今天到厂里来表演操作法。吕阿珍来了！她的操作台周围拥满了人，人头重重叠叠，有的人爬上了桌子。阿狗娘也早已听得这事，她肚里寻思：“人家扯得这么快，主要是劲道粗，这也没啥稀奇，我们车间里小妹一天产量一百四十多斤，你看，人长得柏油桶那样结实，干起活来穷凶极恶，汗水直淋。”阿狗娘看到今天这么热闹，技术科同志来了，支部书记也来了，她想：“有看没看，譬如不看，看一下吧！”挤到人堆里一看之后，她一双眼睛就像被吸铁石吸牢一样，盯住吕阿珍轻快敏捷的操作不放。“怎么？这么快！又那么干净利索，一双手就像弹钢琴那样灵活轻松，一点不似小妹那样死花力气，这操作倒真有道理。”于是她使劲挤到最前面，直看到收场。
    放工后，阿狗娘回到家里坐在床沿上纳鞋底，脑筋里总丢不开吕阿珍操作法。她看到引线要穿过厚厚的鞋底，手里一定要使软硬功，光靠蛮劲不中用，引线穿不过，弄不好还要断在鞋底上。“扯烟叶也同样，光靠蛮力无用，只要掌握好操作。吕阿珍费劲不大能扯好叶子，我老太婆力气用不足，不用担忧，只要学会技术，保险提高产量。”又一想：“学技术不是一朝一夕的事，我老太婆的手又没有小姑娘家的灵活，不要现世了，算了吧！”
    过二天，阿狗娘听说许多人学了新操作法后产量都有提高，使她特别关心的是小妹也学习了新操作法。现在小妹做起活来姿势自然，少花蛮劲，而产量却提高了百分之五。阿狗娘还不大相信，下午扯了二把烟叶，拿了个搪瓷杯假装到工场门口倒茶，经过扯叶弄堂，实在是去看看小妹究竟怎样操作。一看呵！的确好，非但那股穷凶极恶的丑态没有了，外加连过去一直挂着汗珠的前额也光滑滑地不出急汗。阿狗娘回到座位上，旁边青工施英打趣似地问她：“阿狗娘，你出去倒茶，在工场里兜了一圈，看看人家操作，一定学着不少先进经验！”阿狗娘急忙回答：“没有什么！没有什么？”但是她手里却按着吕阿珍操作法做起来，施英一眼看见，差些“噗哧”笑出声音，紧接着说：“对！这样做，稍为抬高些手臂……。”说也奇怪，阿狗娘过去扯了十斤叶子，手臂就像缚上了十斤重的铁块，又重又累，现在，一个下半天扯了三十斤烟叶，也不感疲劳，一双臂膀像长了翅膀一样，又滑爽又灵活。
    今天，一车间又像办喜事般热闹。技术科同志来了，党支部书记也来了，连厨房间大司务也来凑热闹，庆贺阿狗娘学了新操作法产量提高了百分之六十。大家都说：“阿狗娘快得像乘飞机了！”
