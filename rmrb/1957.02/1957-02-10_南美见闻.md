Glimpses of South America
　　Modern Housing

　　The guidebook says: "São Paulo is the fastest-growing city in the world. Its population of over three million includes people of all races and nationalities." Indeed, the commercial district of this city is full of skyscrapers, and new apartment buildings are everywhere. The houses in the residential areas are even more competitive in their style and color. Moreover, the city is under construction everywhere, a scene of prosperity that we have not seen in Western Europe and other South American cities.

　　It is said that the residences of São Paulo are world-renowned. Indeed, the residential areas of this city are truly clean and beautiful places. As we walked through this area, we rarely saw houses with completely identical styles. The homes of wealthy people often have large gardens. We once were guests at the home of one of the largest real estate developers. His hall could accommodate hundreds of people, and at the other end was a small stage, where a female pianist was invited to play Chopin's music at the cocktail party. The garden also had a swimming pool and a ball court. But even ordinary houses always have a small garden, the smallest of which is only a few square meters. Some connect the garden with the living room, which saves even more land.

　　Many modern-style houses are well-designed. In my opinion, some houses are really economical and practical. The unplastered brick walls form patterns in the texture. Placing a few unhewn large stones in front of the door adds interest to the garden path, without necessarily paving the road with cement and gravel in large chunks. Built-in wardrobes and bookshelves on the walls of the room save a lot of wood for furniture and also make the house look much larger. Sometimes, bookshelves and wall cabinets for small ornaments are made entirely of bricks and stones, and the texture of the plastered brick and stone seams is a good decorative pattern. Even the simplest box-like small buildings try to break the monotony of the matchbox style in the design of doors and windows; it is even rarer to see houses with the same dull gray color from beginning to end. As a last resort, people plant some ivy to cover up the ugliness. In short, it seems that every brick and stone of these residences has been designed and conceived, and it does not seem to waste particularly much labor and materials. Even in the downtown area, architects can think of ways to avoid the simple and monotonous taste of the so-called constructivists in the lines of doors and windows and the overall color of those box-like skyscrapers.

　　We have heard that Brazilian architects also consider the issue of using local materials, and try to use less steel bars when building large buildings, reducing the height of each floor, which can not only save money but also take into account the local climatic conditions as much as possible. More importantly, every small area in the building is fully utilized. In the eyes of us laymen, this is very worthy of cherishing and learning. Of course, there are also some strange things in modernist architecture. For example, in a twenty or thirty-story building, the bottom floor is empty. The entire building is pressed on some pillars that are like the two legs of a divided compass, which become thinner and sharper closer to the ground. Sometimes, the architect arranges this bottom floor into a small garden and parking lot, and when people walk in, they feel as if they can't breathe, and when they see the pointed and thin pillars, it seems that the entire building might collapse at any time.

    南美见闻	赵沨
      现代化的住宅
    导游小册子上说：“圣保罗是世界上发展最快的城市。三百多万人口中包括着各种的人种和民族。”的确，这个城市的商业区到处是摩天楼，新的公寓大楼也在在皆是。住宅区的房子更是争奇斗艳，有着不同的式样和色彩。而且，这个城市到处都在兴工建筑，是我们在西欧和其他南美城市没有见过的一片繁荣景象。
    据说，圣保罗城的住宅是世界闻名的。的确，这个城市的住宅区真是清洁、美丽的所在。我们在这个地区走过，很少看见有完全相同式样的住宅。有钱人家的住宅往往有着很大的花园。我们曾经在一个最大的地产商人家作客，他的大厅可以容纳好几百人，另一端还有一个小舞台，酒会上请了一位女钢琴家在这舞台上演奏萧邦的音乐。花园里还有游泳池和球场。但一般的住宅也总有一个小的庭园，最小的甚至只不过几公尺见方而已。有的把庭园和客厅结连在一起，就更加节省地皮了。
    有许多现代风格的住宅的设计是很好的。在我看有些房子真的作到了经济和适用。不用抹灰的砖墙，在纹路上构成图案。门前铺几块不加修凿的大石使整个庭园的径路就平添一番趣味，并不必须都用洋灰、石子来大块大块地铺设通路。房间墙壁上造就了衣橱和书架，更节省许多家具的木料，也显得房子宽大许多。有时，书架和放小摆设的壁橱，根本就是用砖石砌的，而抹灰的砖石缝的纹路便是很好的图案装饰。即便是最简单的方盒子式的小楼房，在门窗的设计上也尽量打破火柴盒式的单调；更少见那种从头到尾一色灰溜溜的房子，万不得已，人们也种上些爬墙虎来遮遮丑。总之，看来这些住宅一砖一石都是经过设计和构思的，想来这也不见得特别浪费工料。即便是在市区那些方盒子式的摩天楼，建筑师也能在门窗的线条和整体的色彩上想些办法，避去那些所谓构成派的简单、枯燥的味道。
    我们听说，巴西的建筑师还考虑到就地取材的问题，盖大楼也尽量少用钢筋，减低每层楼的高度，既能少用钱，也尽量考虑到当地的气候条件。更重要的，建筑中的每一小块面积都被充分利用了。在我们这些外行看来，这都很值得珍视和学习。当然，现代主义的建筑也很有些奇形怪状的东西。比如说二、三十层的大楼房，最下一层却是空洞洞的。整个大楼压在一些像分开的圆规的两支脚那样的越近地面越细越尖的柱子上。有时，建筑师把这最下一层布置成小花园和停车场，人一走进去就好像压得透不过气来，一看那又尖又细的柱脚，好像整个大楼说不定甚么时候就会倒下来似的。　　　　　（未完）（附图片）
