    "Four Diligences" Supply and Marketing Section
    By Our Reporter Zhang Jing
    In a small alley on Lindun Road in Suzhou, there is a small factory manufacturing electrical equipment – the jointly owned state-private Universe Electrical Equipment Factory. The DC voltmeters produced by this factory have reached the quality of imported goods in terms of precision, but the price is less than a quarter of that of imported goods. In 1956, a total of 4,963 units were produced, but this still could not meet market demand.
    Despite the high demand for their products, the raw materials for manufacturing instruments and equipment were a major problem. This factory produces a total of four products, requiring more than 100 kinds of raw materials, most of which are ferrous and non-ferrous metals that are not easily purchased on the market, such as copper, iron, aluminum, zinc, chromium, nickel, etc., and must be solved entirely by the factory itself. This was indeed a difficult problem for this small factory.
    However, since the Universe Factory became a joint venture in July last year, it has maintained normal production. They made preparations early at the end of last year, so the main raw materials for the first quarter of this year have been basically resolved, and all the difficult-to-obtain raw materials have been secured. It is estimated that this year's production level can greatly exceed last year's.
    Why is this factory able to solve the raw material problem itself? Chen Baorong, the director of the Universe Factory, told me: "This should first of all be attributed to our supply and marketing section. Because they are diligent in running around, diligent in asking questions, diligent in exploring, and diligent in making connections, they have ensured the supply of raw materials."
    The supply and marketing section has a total of five people, which is the largest department in the factory and also the one with the largest workload. They are not only responsible for the purchase of more than 100 kinds of raw materials, but also responsible for contacting and negotiating with more than 20 processing and collaborative units outside the factory; not only responsible for handling the reporting, delivery, packing, warehousing, and consignment procedures for raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products, but also responsible for warehouse management and the receipt, payment, and inventory of raw materials within the factory. From inside the factory to outside the factory, from Suzhou to Shanghai and Nanjing, their activities can be found everywhere along the Ninghu line. Usually, except for the warehouse manager, it is difficult to find anyone from the supply and marketing section.
    Xu Bingkui, the head of the supply and marketing section, was originally a private sector employee. He is relatively familiar with the electrical equipment business, understands some production technology, and has old relationships with certain related factories and shops along the Ninghu line. He and several purchasing staff have mastered the addresses, phone numbers, and the names of those in charge of many manufacturing and sales units related to the factory. They regard these as their most valuable assets and often take the initiative to understand their production and sales situations and shipping schedules. They pay attention to which factory can process for them, which units may have the raw materials they need, when a certain company will receive goods, and even what difficulties others may have. Based on these relationships, they have found many sources of raw materials. They have a long-term cooperative relationship with the Suzhou Black and White Iron Production Cooperative, and their contact is very close. Once, because they needed a certain specification of iron sheet, which was not available on the market, they connected with the Suzhou United Production Cooperative through this cooperative and found two qualified large iron sheets in their warehouse. In Shanghai, they also have many connections. Two people from the supply and marketing section are stationed in Shanghai specifically to purchase raw materials. This year, they signed a long-term processing contract with Shanghai Zhou Faxing Hardware Materials Store, which processes the copper studs on bakelite switches, solving a large part of the difficulty in purchasing raw copper materials.
    The supply and marketing section always adheres to the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit in maintaining contact with the same industry. They not only understand the product types in the same industry, but also exchange raw materials with each other, taking care of each other and sharing resources. They not only solve problems for themselves, but also sincerely help brother factories overcome raw material difficulties. Last year, they needed 10G of black iron sheet. This specification of iron sheet had long been out of stock on the market. They ran all over the hardware materials departments in Shanghai and Nanjing, but could not buy it. When they returned to the factory, seeing that the workshop was about to stop work and wait for materials, Xu Bingkui, with a glimmer of hope, went to the relevant brother factories in the city for help. As a result, he found this specification of iron sheet in the open space of the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory. Upon further inquiry, this type of iron sheet was not suitable for the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory, and the factory was already preparing to return it to the furnace for reprocessing. Xu Bingkui then obtained more than 500 kilograms of black iron sheet from this factory, which timely supplied the needs of production. In the process of solving the raw material problem, because they adhered to the spirit of taking care of themselves and others, not being conservative, and not being closed off, this deepened the friendship with brother factories. Many brother factories actively provided them with clues to raw material sources, thereby further expanding their procurement scope.
    They are also good at taking advantage of many accidental opportunities and occasions to find materials. Some rare metals that cannot be bought on the market are difficult to find their sources for a while. They inquire and pay attention at any time in their daily lives. Unlike some purchasing staff who only rely on a letter of introduction, ask at the counter and leave when they are told they don't have it, they are good at conducting in-depth and meticulous work. Sometimes, even if a store doesn't have it, they don't rush to leave. Sometimes, they simply sit down and chat with the shop assistants, consciously publicizing the factory's products and telling others the specifications of the materials they need, in the hope of getting their concern and help. Often, they find the materials they need in such occasions.
    Within the factory, the supply and marketing section is also diligent in contacting the workshops, and actively researching the use of various substitutes with the production department to reduce the repetition of raw material procurement work. Xu Bingkui is familiar with the supply and marketing business, and also has some knowledge of production technology. Therefore, in addition to purchasing raw materials according to the purchase order, he can sometimes take the initiative to discuss with the workshop and replace several difficult-to-buy raw materials with substitutes. Replacing the original aluminum shell with a bakelite shell for testing is not only more beautiful and lighter than the original aluminum shell, but also can increase the output by more than ten times, and reduce the annual cost by more than 4,700 yuan. In raw material management, at least one person from the supply and marketing section goes to each workshop every day to understand the supply of raw materials and promptly schedule solutions to problems. They insist on regularly cleaning up workshop products and counting warehouses to ensure that useful materials can be used. In September last year, they picked out 668 iron feet for voltmeters from waste materials, which could be used for a month. The cleaned insulation sheets and other materials can be mostly used after processing, saving 1,083 yuan.
    Of course, the reason why the Universe Factory's supply and marketing section can achieve such results is inseparable from the leadership of the state factory director. It is understood that the factory director has spent a lot of energy in solving the raw material problem. Xu Bingkui, the private sector employee and head of the supply and marketing section, originally had a bad work style and was alienated from the workers. He only changed after continuous education from the factory director, and the factory director was able to use his strengths, so he played the above-mentioned active role. Factory director Chen Baorong said with confidence: "Raw materials are dead, but people are alive. In 1957, we will not only overcome the raw material difficulties, not only consolidate the existing achievements, but also improve our production level and accumulate more funds for the country."

### “四勤”供销股

    “四勤”供销股
    本报记者　张竞
    在苏州市临顿路的一条小巷子里，有一家制造电工器材的小厂——公私合营宇宙电工器材厂。这家厂出品的直流电压表，精密程度已经赶上了进口货的质量，价格却不及进口货的四分之一，1956年共生产四千九百六十三只，仍不能满足市场的需要。
    尽管产品在市场上供不应求，制造仪表和器材的原材料却大成问题。这个工厂一共生产四种产品，所需要的原材料在一百种以上，而且大部分是市场上不易采购的黑色金属和有色金属如铜、铁、铝、锌、铬、镍等等，完全由本厂自己设法解决。这对这小工厂说来，确是一个困难问题。
    可是，宇宙厂从去年7月合营至今，始终保持了正常的生产，他们在去年年底就早做好了准备，因此，今年第一季度的主要原料已经基本上得到解决，凡是难办的原材料都有了着落，预计今年的生产水平还可以大大超过去年。
    为什么这个厂能够自己解决原料的困难呢？宇宙厂的厂长陈报荣同志告诉我：“这应该首先归功于我们的供销股。因为他们能勤跑、勤问、勤摸、勤联系，因而才保证了原材料的供应。”
    供销股一共有五个人，这是全厂人数最多，同时也是工作量最大的一个科室。他们不仅要负责一百多种原材料的采购，而且还要负责和厂外二十多个加工协作单位联系接洽；不仅要负责办理原料、半制品和成品的报交、装箱、送仓和托运手续，而且要负责厂内的仓库管理和原材料的收付清点工作。从厂内到厂外，从苏州到上海、南京，在宁沪沿线到处都有他们活动的踪迹。平时，除仓库管理员外，很难找到供销股的人。
    供销股长徐炳奎原是一个私方人员，他对电工器材的业务比较熟悉，也懂得一些生产技术，宁沪沿线一带某些有关工厂和商店还有他的老关系。他和几个采购员，掌握了许多与本厂有关的制造单位和销售单位的地址、电话和负责人的名单，他们把这些当作自己最宝贵的一份财产，经常主动出去了解他们的产销情况和派货日程，那家厂可以为他们加工，那些单位可能有自己所需要的原材料，那家公司什么时候进货，甚至人家有什么困难他们都能注意调查。凭着这些关系，就找到了不少原料的来源。他们和苏州市黑白铁生产合作社有着长期的协作关系，联系很密切，有一次因需要某种规格的铁皮，市场上采购不到，便通过这个合作社同苏州市联合生产合作社接上了关系，在他们的仓库里找到了两张合格的大铁皮。在上海，他们的关系也很多，供销股有两个人是专门驻在上海采办原料的。今年他们和上海周发兴五金材料行订了长期加工合同，由他们加工胶木闸刀上的铜桩头，就解决了很大一部分生铜原料采购上的困难。
    供销股和同业之间所保持的联系，始终坚持着互助互利的原则，他们不仅了解同业中的产品类型，而且能相互交流原材料，做到互相照应，互通有无，不仅给自己解决问题，同时也诚恳地帮助兄弟厂克服原材料困难。去年，他们需要10G的黑铁皮，这种规格的铁皮市场上早已脱销，他们跑遍了上海、南京的五金材料部门，都没有买到，回到厂里，眼看车间里快要停工待料，徐炳奎抱着一线希望再到本市的各有关兄弟厂去求援，结果在苏州农业机械厂的空场上被他发现了这种规格的铁皮，再一打听，这种铁皮对苏州农业机械厂并不适用，而且这个厂已经准备回炉加工后使用。徐炳奎便在这个厂得到五百多公斤的黑铁皮，及时供应了生产上的需要。在解决原材料问题的过程中，由于他们本着照顾自己也照顾别人，不保守、不封锁的精神，这样就加深了同兄弟厂之间的友谊，许多兄弟工厂主动供给他们原材料货源的线索，因而更扩大了他们的采购面。
    他们还善于利用许多偶然的机会和场合去摸材料。有些市场上买不到的稀有金属，一时很难摸到它的货源，他们就在日常生活中随时询问，随时注意。他们不像某些采购员只凭一张介绍信，到人家柜台上一问没有就走，而是善于进行深入细致的工作，有时即使这家商店没有，也不急于走开，有时索性坐下来和营业员闲聊天，聊天中就有意识地把本厂的产品宣传宣传，也把自己需要的材料规格告诉别人，以期得到别人的关心和帮助。常常就在这种场合里，摸到所需要的材料。
    在厂内，供销股也很勤于同车间里联系，并积极和生产部门研究采用各种代用品，以减轻原材料采购工作的重复。徐炳奎对供销业务较熟悉，而且在生产技术上也有一些知识，因此，他除了按进货单购进原材料之外，有时还能主动同车间研究，将几种难买的原料改用代用品。试验用胶木壳代替原来的铝壳，不但比原来的铝壳更美观更轻便，而且产量能提高十多倍，全年成本能降低四千七百元以上。在原料管理上，供销股每天有一人至少要到各车间去跑一趟，及时了解原材料供应的情况，有问题及时调度解决。他们坚持定期清理车间制品和清点仓库的制度，使有用之材都能加以使用。去年9月份，他们由废料中拣出了六百六十八只电压表的铁脚，可供一个月的使用，清理出的绝缘片和其他材料，经处理后大部可以使用，节约了一千零八十三元。
    当然，宇宙厂的供销股所以能有这样的成绩，是和公方厂长的领导分不开的。据了解，厂长在解决原材料问题上曾花了很大的精力。私方人员供销股股长徐炳奎本来作风不好，同职工群众有隔阂，经厂长不断的教育才有转变，厂长并且能够使用他的长处，他才发挥了上述的积极作用。厂长陈报荣同志满怀信心地说：“原材料是死的，人是活的，1957年我们不仅要战胜原材料的困难，不仅要巩固已有的成绩，而且要使我们的生产水平再提高一步，给国家积累更多的资金。”
