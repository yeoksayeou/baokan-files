Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th. Nearly two hundred state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Jiangsu Province are actively producing agricultural fertilizer, farm tools, pesticides, and pesticide machinery, rushing to repair water pumps, double-wheeled double-shared plows, and various large and small farm tools to support farmers' spring plowing production.

Jiangsu Province's pesticide, fertilizer, and agricultural machinery factories have overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials in the increase production and practice economy movement and are actively arranging this year's production plans. The output of many products has exceeded last year. The Nanjing Yongli Ning Plant, a joint state-private enterprise, is one of the largest chemical factories in China producing ammonium sulfate fertilizer. In January, it produced more than 16,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, exceeding its plan. The Suzhou Chemical Plant, built last year, will produce more than 6,000 tons of bone meal this year to support agricultural production. Changzhou Machinery Factory, Wuxi Power Machine Factory, and other units have already manufactured more than 100 water pumps, and they will manufacture 300 water pumps before rice transplanting.

This year, machinery factories and chemical factories have also begun to produce more than ten new products that have never been produced before, such as tractor-drawn cultivators, animal-drawn cultivators, animal-drawn ridgers, and copper sulfate. Some local machinery industries are also undertaking the task of repairing farm tools. Currently, nearly twenty machinery factories are busy repairing water pumps for agricultural production cooperatives throughout Jiangsu Province. It is estimated that the factories will complete the repair of more than 4,000 water pumps before rice transplanting.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th. More than 90,000 iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft workers in Jiangsu Province are stepping up the production of farm tools to support spring plowing production. According to the needs of many areas in the province to convert dry land into paddy fields this year, handicraft production cooperatives in northern Jiangsu have produced a large number of farm tools suitable for paddy fields. At present, Binhai County has 1,500 completed and semi-finished waterwheels, and Huaian County has completed the production of 100 waterwheels. In order to improve the quality of farm tool production this year, iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft workers in Songjiang County held a technical exchange meeting to study and improve production measures.

Handicraft workers have come up with many ways to overcome the difficulties of raw materials. The Xuzhou Hardware Sixth Production Cooperative smelts the iron filings and small iron scraps that used to be discarded as waste into ingots or square iron to produce farm tools. Xu Luanrong and Xu Zhaoqing, members of the Louwang District Wood Industry Production Cooperative in Yancheng County, recently successfully developed a new type of windmill. This windmill uses simple materials, does not pick up the wind direction, rotates quickly, and is safe to use. Anyone, regardless of gender or age, can master it. The handicraft workers call it the "New Cooperative Windmill." Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture has sent people to study it.

This year, handicraft cooperatives have also paid special attention to the production of small farm tools, overcoming the phenomenon that some cooperatives blindly produced large farm tools after the establishment of cooperatives last year, resulting in the backlog of some products. For the production of these small farm tools, various localities emphasize the need to find out the needs, grasp the characteristics of seasonal changes, and achieve local production and local sales. After investigation, Zhenjiang Prefecture found that there were 53 kinds of single sickles alone among the local small farm tools, and the types of hoes and other farm tools were also different. Now they are improving production according to these characteristics.

    江苏各工厂和手工业社克服困难
    赶制生产资料支援农民春耕
    新华社南京12日电　江苏省近两百个国营、地方国营、公私合营工厂，正在积极生产农肥、农具、农药和药械，赶修戽水机、双轮双铧犁和各种大小农具，支援农民春耕生产。
    江苏省各农药、农肥和农业机械厂，在增产节约运动中克服了原材料不足的困难，积极安排今年的生产计划，许多产品的产量都超过去年。南京公私合营永利宁厂是我国氮肥硫铵产量最大的化学工厂之一，1月份生产了一万六千多吨氮肥，超额完成了计划。去年建成的苏州化工厂今年将生产六千多吨骨粉支援农业生产。常州机器厂、无锡动力机厂等单位，已经制造了一百多台戽水机，他们在插秧以前将要制造出三百台戽水机。
    各机械厂、化工厂今年还开始生产过去从来没有生产过的机引中耕器、畜力中耕器、畜力培土器和硫酸铜等十多种新产品。有些地方机械工业还担负了农具的修理任务。目前近二十个机械工厂正忙着为江苏省各地的农业生产合作社赶修戽水机，预计各厂在插秧以前将完成四千多台戽水机的修理工作。
    新华社南京12日电　江苏省九万多个铁、木、竹手工业工人正在加紧生产农具，支援春耕生产。苏北各地的手工业生产社根据今年省内不少地区旱田改水田的需要，生产了大批适合水田用的农具。目前滨海县生产的水车成品和半成品有一千五百件，淮安县已有一百部水车生产完工。松江县铁、木、竹手工业工人为了提高今年农具生产的质量，举行了技术交流会研究改进生产的措施。
    手工业工人为了克服原料困难，想出了不少办法。徐州市五金第六生产合作社把过去经常当作废物丢掉的刨口铁屑和细小的剪口铁边炼成元铁或方铁生产农具。盐城县楼王区木业生产社社员徐銮荣、徐兆庆最近试制成功一种新式风车，这种风车所用的材料简单，不拣风向，旋转迅速，使用安全，不论男女老少都能掌握。手工业工人们都叫它“新式合作风车”。现在，江苏省农业厅已派人去研究。
    各地手工业社，今年还特别重视小农具的生产，克服去年建社以后有些社盲目生产大农具，造成部分产品积压的现象。对于这种小农具的生产，各地强调要摸清需要，掌握季节变化的特点，做到当地生产当地销售。镇江专区经过调查后发现当地小农具中，单镰刀一项就有五十三种，锄头和其他农具的种类也各有不同，现在他们正根据这些特点，改进生产。
