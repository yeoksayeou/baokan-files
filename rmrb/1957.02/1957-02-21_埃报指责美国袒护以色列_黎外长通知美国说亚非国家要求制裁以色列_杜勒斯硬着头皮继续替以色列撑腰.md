Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 20th: Cairo newspapers on the 19th believed that the United States should be held responsible for Israel's attitude of defying United Nations resolutions.

"Al-Gomhouria" published an editorial stating that the United States had made every possible effort to protect Israel from sanctions. The newspaper believes that imposing sanctions is the only effective weapon to maintain the prestige of the United Nations and ensure peace in the Middle East.

"Al-Ahram" said that the United States had rendered the United Nations resolution for Israel to immediately withdraw its troops ineffective through actions taken outside the United Nations.

"Al-Akhbar" pointed out that the United States' interference in the United Nations has adversely affected the prestige of that international organization.

Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: Washington dispatch: Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik told U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rountree on the 19th that Asian and African countries in the United Nations will propose a resolution to sanction Israel at the United Nations General Assembly discussion on the Middle East issue on the 21st, unless Israeli troops immediately withdraw from the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip.

Malik also stated that Arab countries would oppose the General Assembly once again postponing the discussion on the issue of Israeli troop withdrawal. The General Assembly was originally scheduled to discuss this issue on the 19th, but it was postponed to the 21st at the request of the United States.

Meanwhile, news reports indicate that the United States is gathering some Western countries to prepare a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly, which will once again demand that Israeli troops withdraw from Egyptian territory, but will not advocate for sanctions against Israel.

Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said on the 19th that Israel has the right to send ships into the Gulf of Aqaba. At the same time, when the Suez Canal is reopened, Egypt should allow Israeli ships to pass through the canal like it allows ships from any other country.

Dulles's words of support for Israel were spoken at a press conference.

Dulles said that the United States hopes that ships registered in the United States will be able to sail into the Gulf of Aqaba, but the United States will not take the lead in sending ships into the Gulf of Aqaba to determine whether the region is an international waterway.

Regarding the issue of Israel's withdrawal of troops from Egypt, Dulles said that the United States still hopes and believes that Israel may withdraw its troops, trusting in the resolutions of the United Nations and the guarantees of the United States. He refused to answer whether the U.S. government was prepared to support sanctions against Israel if Israel did not withdraw its troops again.

Someone asked Dulles to comment on Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Green's remarks that the United States should recognize the Chinese government sooner or later. Dulles said he thought it was "too early" to start talking about the United States recognizing the Chinese government.

Dulles also talked about the "embargo" issue, saying: Since the Hungarian incident, there has been a tendency to implement the Coordinating Committee's regulations applicable to the Soviet Union more strictly. The same may be true of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Export Controls.

    埃报指责美国袒护以色列
    黎外长通知美国说亚非国家要求制裁以色列
    杜勒斯硬着头皮继续替以色列撑腰
    新华社开罗20日电　开罗报纸19日认为美国要对以色列藐视联合国决议的态度负责。
    “共和国报”发表社论说，美国作了一切可能的努力来保护以色列免受制裁。这家报纸认为，实施制裁是维护联合国威信和确保中东和平的唯一有效的武器。
    “金字塔报”说，美国已经由于在联合国以外所采取的行动而使联合国要以色列立即撤军的决议不发生效力。
    “消息报”指出，美国对联合国的干涉已经不利地影响到那个国际机构的威信。
    据新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：黎巴嫩外交部长马利克19日对美国助理国务卿朗特里说，联合国亚非国家将在21日联合国大会讨论中东问题时提出制裁以色列的提案，除非以色列军队立即撤出亚喀巴湾和加沙地区。
    马利克还表明，阿拉伯国家将反对大会再一次延期讨论以色列撤军问题。大会本来订于19日讨论这个问题，后来应美国的要求延期到21日。
    同时有消息说，美国正在纠合一些西方国家准备向联合国大会提出一个提案，它将再一次要求以色列军队撤出埃及领土，但是不主张对以色列实行制裁。
    据新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯19日说，以色列有权派遣船只进入亚喀巴湾。同时，当苏伊士运河重新开放的时候，埃及应该像准许其他任何国家的船只那样，准许以色列的船只通过这条运河。
    杜勒斯这些为以色列撑腰的话是在记者招待会上说的。
    杜勒斯说，美国希望在美国登记的船只能够驶入亚喀巴湾，但是美国不会为了确定关于这个地区是国际水道而带头派遣船只进入亚喀巴湾。
    谈到以色列从埃及撤军的问题，杜勒斯说美国仍然抱有希望，觉得以色列可能撤军，信赖联合国的决议和美国的保证。他拒绝回答如果以色列再不撤军，美国政府是否准备支持对以色列采取制裁行动。
    有人要求杜勒斯就参议院外交委员会主席格林关于美国迟早应该承认中国政府的谈话发表意见。杜勒斯说，他认为，现在就开始谈论美国承认中国政府“还为时过早”。
    杜勒斯还谈到“禁运”问题，他说：自从匈牙利事件以来，有一种企图把应用于苏联的统筹委员会的规定执行得严格一些的趋势。关于巴黎对华贸易管制国际委员会可能也是一样。
