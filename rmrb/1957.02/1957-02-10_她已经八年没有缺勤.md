    She Has Not Been Absent for Eight Years

    In a quiet alley on Guangou Main Street in Tianjin, I visited the home of Cai Shumei, a female worker at the Tianjin Yixiang Weaving Factory who has maintained perfect attendance for eight years.

    It was the third day after the Spring Festival. Cai Shumei and her mother-in-law, Xing Niang, had just finished lunch. They were chatting while tidying up the dishes.

    "Shumei is honest and doesn't like to talk much, but she is very competitive. She has been with my family for more than eight months, and she gets up early and works late, going to work on time regardless of wind or rain," said Xing Niang. "When they were getting married, I said that Shumei had been working hard in the factory since she was a child, and she should take a few days off to have fun after getting married. But they didn't listen. They discussed it and decided to get married on 'May Day' Labor Day. I said, 'It's up to you.' As it happened, Shumei went to Beijing to attend a meeting (National Advanced Producers Representatives Conference) at that time, which delayed the wedding. Afterwards, I persuaded them again, suggesting they take two days off and get the wedding done sooner. After discussing it, they found a Saturday, and it also happened to be Shumei's day shift off, so it didn't delay work."

    Cai Shumei continued, "We have an alarm clock at home, so I sleep soundly. Before, my family was not well-off, and we didn't have a watch. Every day, I relied on the weather or listening to the church bells nearby to go to work. In winter, it was still dark at six o'clock in the morning when I went to work. At that time, I often woke up in the middle of the night and went to the factory, only to find that it was four or five o'clock.

    "One morning, I woke up and lay in bed for a long time without hearing the bells. I got up quickly and went to the yard to take a look, and it was already late. I hurried to the factory. On the way, I looked at the electric meter next to the road. It was still more than ten minutes before work, so I felt relieved. Who knew, there was a power outage in the middle of the night, and no one had adjusted the electric meter on the road, so it was five minutes slow. By the time I got to the factory, I was already late. I was so anxious that I fainted on the spot. When I woke up, I cried sadly. The workers all comforted me. Some workers said, 'You haven't been absent or late for several years. It doesn't matter if you're late once in a while.' But I thought to myself, 'Not being absent or late is the most basic responsibility of a worker. I have low education and a bad memory, and I can't create inventions like others to increase wealth for the country. But I haven't even fulfilled the most basic responsibility.'"

    From then on, Cai Shumei became more careful. No matter what happened, she never delayed going to work. In the winter of 1954, she was poisoned by gas while sleeping at home during the day after working the night shift. When she woke up, she felt unwell all over. Her mother said, "Rest at home for a day. I'll go to the factory to ask for leave for you." Shumei thought about it: the entire factory has eighteen looms, relying on only two people to wind weft bobbins. If I take a day off, what will happen with only one person left?

    "It's okay, I just have a slight headache, it will be fine in a while," she said, and got up to go to the factory. On the way, she thought about how her father was a railway worker. In order to earn more money to support his family, he worked day and night, so tired that he vomited blood and became weak, and he didn't have money to see a doctor. He died young. A widow and orphans had to survive, and she had been working for capitalists in the factory since she was nine years old. In winter, she wore a thin cotton-padded jacket and shoes with the soles falling off, tied with hemp rope. Working ten hours a day, the money she earned wasn't even enough for the family to drink porridge. After liberation, wages were adjusted several times, income increased, and her brother, who had been unemployed for many years, also found a job. The smile on her mother's face also increased. As she thought about it, she felt refreshed and full of energy, and strode into the workshop. That night, she wound several hundred more weft bobbins than usual.

    Every day after work, Cai Shumei, except for attending meetings or going to evening cultural school, doesn't watch plays or movies, and maintains enough sleep time. On Sundays, she and her husband watch a movie, take a walk in the park, or visit friends, not allowing herself to become mentally fatigued. Her mother-in-law, Xing Niang, is also very considerate to her. Everything at home, including food, clothing, and supplies, is arranged properly, and she is not allowed to get tired. Whenever she goes to work in the afternoon and returns home after eleven o'clock at night, Xing Niang always asks her daughter to go to the street to greet her sister-in-law. Dirty clothes are hidden secretly by the daughter in law, who does not have time to wash and is embarrassed to give them to her mother-in-law. However, while she is at work, Xing Niang finds them and washes them clean.

    Last winter, Cai Shumei became pregnant, had a poor appetite, and was physically weak, and didn't like to move around. After work, she lived at her mother's house, which was closer to the factory. Xing Niang went to see her every two or three days and bought a lot of fruit for her to eat. Cai Shumei said, "My mother-in-law treats me like her own daughter. Her old lady also deserves credit for me not being absent after getting married."

### 她已经八年没有缺勤

    她已经八年没有缺勤	新华社记者　孟帆
    在天津官沟大街一条安静的胡同里，我访问了天津义祥织布厂的女工——保持八年全勤的蔡树梅的家。
    这是春节后的第三天，蔡树梅和她的婆婆邢娘刚刚吃过午饭。她们一边拾掇着碗筷，一边闲谈着。
    “树梅这孩子人老实，不爱说话，可是怪要强的。到我家八个多月了，她起早贪黑，刮风下雨都按时去上工。”邢娘说：“他们要结婚的时候，我说树梅从小就在工厂里受劳累，结婚了，该请几天假好好玩玩。可是，他们不听。两个人一商量，看好了‘五一’劳动节放假的日子结婚。我说依你们。恰巧，那时候树梅到北京去开会（全国先进生产者代表会议），把婚期误了。事后，我又劝他们，还是请两天假，早点把喜事办了吧。他们一商量，找了个星期六，又赶上树梅歇白班，还是没耽误工作。”
    蔡树梅接着说：“家里有闹钟，睡觉也踏实。从前，我娘家生活不富裕，没有表，每天上班靠看天气或听附近教堂的钟声。到了冬天，早晨六点钟上班天还黑着，那时我常常在半夜就起来，到了工厂一看，才四、五点钟。
    “有一天早晨，我醒来了，在床上躺了很久也没听到钟声。我急忙起来到院里一看，天已经不早了，就赶紧往厂里跑。半路上看了一下马路旁边的电表，离上班还差十多分钟，这才放了心。谁知，半夜停了电，马路上的电表没有人拨，慢了五分钟，等我到了工厂已经迟到了。心里一着急，当时就晕过去了。醒来的时候，伤心地直哭。工人们都安慰我。有的工人说：你几年也不缺勤、不迟到，偶尔迟到了一次不算什么。可是我心里想：不缺勤、不迟到是一个工人最基本的责任。我文化低，脑子又不好，不能像别人那样创造发明，给国家增加财富。可是，我连最起码的责任都没有尽到。”
    从此，蔡树梅更经心了。无论发生什么事情，她都没有耽误上班。1954年的冬天，她下了夜班，白天在家睡觉的时候被煤气熏昏了。醒来的时候，浑身不好受。妈妈说：在家歇一天吧，妈妈上厂给你请假去。树梅想了想：全厂十八台织布机，只靠两个人打纬纱穗子，自己要是歇了工，只剩下一个人怎么行呢？
      “不要紧，就是头有点昏，一会就好了。”她说着，就起来向工厂走去了。在路上，她想着父亲是铁路工人，为了多挣点钱养活一家老小，白天黑夜的工作，累得吐血力亏，又没有钱看病，年纪轻轻地就死了。寡母、孤儿要活下去，自己从九岁进工厂给资本家干活。冬天下着大雪，穿着一件薄薄的小棉袄，鞋子掉了底用麻绳捆着。一天干十个钟头，挣的钱连家里喝粥都不够。解放以后，几次调整工资，收入增加了，失业多年的哥哥也找到了工作，妈妈脸上的笑容也多起来。她想着想着，觉得精神清爽了，浑身也有了劲儿，迈开脚步走进了车间。这天晚上，她比往常多打了几百个纬纱穗子。
    蔡树梅每天下班以后，除了开会或上业余文化学校，不看戏、不看电影，保持足够的睡眠时间。星期天，她和爱人看一场电影，到公园散步或看看朋友，不使自己精神疲劳。她的婆婆邢娘对她也很体贴。家里的一切吃穿用都安排得妥妥贴贴，不要她劳累。每逢下午上班，夜里十一点多回家，邢娘总是叫女儿到街上去迎嫂嫂。穿脏了的衣服，媳妇没时间洗，又不好意思交给婆婆，偷偷地藏起来。可是，在她上班的时候被邢娘找出来，都给洗得干干净净的。
    去年冬天，蔡树梅怀孕了，胃口不好，身体弱，懒得走动。下了班就住在离工厂较近的娘家。邢娘三天两头去看她，还买了许多水果给她吃。蔡树梅说：“婆婆待我像亲生女儿一样，我结婚以后能不缺勤，她老人家也有功劳。”
