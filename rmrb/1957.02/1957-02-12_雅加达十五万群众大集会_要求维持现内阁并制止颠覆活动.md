Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 11th. A mass rally against subversive activities attended by 150,000 people was held in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, on the morning of February 10th. Many groups composed of workers, farmers, youth, women, and veterans began marching through the streets early in the morning to gather at the venue, holding aloft banners with slogans such as "Support the Joint Chiefs of Staff's actions against subversive activities," "Resolutely eliminate counter-revolutionaries," and "Support the Ali Cabinet."

The mass rally, held in an atmosphere of enthusiasm and excitement, passed a resolution condemning the subversive activities carried out by imperialists in Indonesia. It demanded the continued maintenance of the current cabinet, requested the government to resolutely implement its political program, and urged the government to more earnestly implement the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement and take clearer steps to eliminate the conspiracy group of Lubis, Simbolon, Hussein, and other counter-revolutionaries connected with foreign countries.

The resolution demanded a more resolute struggle to recover West Irian.

The resolution concluded by calling on all the people to strengthen unity, assist and support the President, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Ali Sastroamidjojo government in their efforts to defend the Republic of Indonesia established by the 1945 Declaration of Independence.

The congress also passed an open letter to President Sukarno, expressing support for Sukarno's reform plan. The letter said that the congress firmly believes that this plan is based on the strength of the people, so the congress warmly welcomes this plan and expresses its greatest gratitude to Sukarno.

Representatives of nationalist youth, representatives of the Indonesian People's Youth League, and representatives of the Indonesian Democratic Labor Organization and the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions spoke at the meeting.

Jono, the representative of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions, exposed the conspiracy of the rebels who created the Sumatra incident in his speech. He pointed out that the "Bull Division Council" in Central Sumatra received millions of盾 (guilders) in assistance from Dutch and American foreign enterprises. The "Bull Division Council" and the American Texas Oil Company also planned to cooperate in building a large seaport in Wanggali to suit the United States' military plans in Southeast Asia.

Jono stated that the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions supports the current cabinet. He said that the position of the current cabinet has been strengthened due to the withdrawal of the Masyumi Party, but in order to further strengthen the cabinet's position, the current government should implement the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement and carry out national construction.

Jono said that if the current cabinet falls due to foreign interference, then the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions demands that the new cabinet absorb the Communist Party of Indonesia.

    雅加达十五万群众大集会
    要求维持现内阁并制止颠覆活动
    据新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚首都雅加达2月10日上午十时举行了一个有十五万人参加的反颠覆活动群众大会。由工人、农民、青年、妇女和退伍军人等组成的许多队伍一早就开始经过市街到会场集合，人们高举着写上“支持参谋长联席会议的反颠覆活动的行动”、“坚决肃清反革命分子”和“支持阿里内阁”等口号的标语牌。
    在热烈激昂的情绪中举行的群众大会通过了决议，谴责帝国主义者在印度尼西亚进行的颠覆活动，要求继续维持现内阁，要求政府坚决地执行它的政纲，促请政府更加认真地实施废除圆桌会议协定并且采取更明确的步骤以肃清和外国有联系的卢比斯、西姆波朗、侯赛尼及其他反革命分子的阴谋集团。
    决议要求更坚决地进行收复西伊里安的斗争。
    决议最后号召全体人民加强团结，协助和支持总统、参谋长联席会议和阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府为保卫1945年独立宣言所宣告成立的印度尼西亚共和国而作的努力。
    大会还通过了致苏加诺总统的一封公开信，表示支持苏加诺的革新方案。信中说，大会坚信这个方案是建立在人民力量的基础上的，因此大会热烈欢迎这个方案，并且对朋加诺表示最大的谢意。
    民族主义派青年的代表、印度尼西亚人民青年团的代表和印度尼西亚民主劳工组织、全印度尼西亚工会中央组织的代表都在会上讲了话。
    全印度尼西亚工会中央组织的代表约诺在讲话中揭发制造苏门答腊事件的叛乱者的阴谋。他指出，中苏门答腊“雄牛师委员会”得到了荷、美外国企业的几百万盾的接济。而“雄牛师委员会”和美国德士古石油公司还计划在望加丽合作建立一个为了适应美国在东南亚军事计划而设的大海港。
    约诺表示全印度尼西亚工会中央组织支持现内阁。他说，现内阁的地位由于马斯友美党的退出而加强，但是，为了进一步加强内阁地位，现政府应该实施废除圆桌会议协定，并且进行国家建设。
    约诺说，如果现内阁由于外国的干涉活动而下台，那么，全印度尼西亚工会中央组织要求新内阁吸收印度尼西亚共产党参加。
