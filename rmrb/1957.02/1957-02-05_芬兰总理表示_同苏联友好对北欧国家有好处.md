Xinhua News Agency, February 4th, According to TASS, Copenhagen, February 3rd: Finnish Prime Minister Fagerholm told a Moscow correspondent of the Danish newspaper "Land og Folk" that he was unwilling to interfere in the affairs of other countries, but he firmly believed that if all (European) northern countries established good relations with the Soviet Union like Finland, it would benefit these countries and guarantee peace and security in the Baltic Sea region.

The Danish Communist Party's organ, on its front page, published Fagerholm's remarks under the title "Establishing Good Relations with the Soviet Union is in the Interest of All Northern Countries," also stating that his negotiations in Moscow concerned only economic issues. Fagerholm said, "Finland does not have a sufficient amount of foreign exchange from Western countries, therefore, trade with the Soviet Union is of particular significance to Finland."

Fagerholm went on to point out that Finland hopes to further expand cultural and all other ties with the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, February 4th, According to TASS reports: Finnish Prime Minister Fagerholm and his entourage left Moscow for Leningrad on February 3rd.

    芬兰总理表示
    同苏联友好对北欧国家有好处
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社哥本哈根3日讯：芬兰总理法格霍姆对丹麦“国土与人民报”驻莫斯科的记者说，他不愿意干涉别国的事务，但是他深信，假如所有（欧洲）北方的国家都像芬兰一样，同苏联建立良好关系，这将对这些国家有好处，并且保障了波罗的海地区的和平和安全。
    这家丹麦共产党机关报在第一版上用“同苏联建立良好的关系符合所有北方国家的利益”的题目刊载的法格霍姆的谈话还说，他这次在莫斯科的谈判涉及的仅仅是经济问题。法格霍姆说，“芬兰没有足够数量的西方国家的外汇，因此，同苏联进行贸易对芬兰具有特别重大的意义”。
    法格霍姆接着指出，芬兰希望同苏联更加扩大文化及其他一切的联系。
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：芬兰总理法格霍姆和他的随行人员在2月3日离开莫斯科前往列宁格勒。
