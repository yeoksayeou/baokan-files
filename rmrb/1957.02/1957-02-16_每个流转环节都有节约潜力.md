    Every Link in the Circulation Process Has Potential for Savings
    Zhang Jianping
    The potential for increasing production and practicing economy in the various provincial, municipal, and port companies affiliated with the China National Native Produce Export Corporation is enormous. Many facts prove that savings are possible at every stage necessary for the circulation of goods. For example, in the past year, just twelve units including Hebei, Jilin, Shaanxi, Tianjin, and Shanghai, through mobilizing some possible positive factors and improving business management, saved the state 1,629,000 yuan in domestic circulation costs for just ten commodities, including timber, cellophane noodles, peach kernels, honey, beet pulp, and dried rice noodles. In addition, timely clearing of damaged and obsolete materials from warehouses, just for black fungus and dried chili, recovered over 48 million yuan in losses for the state.
    In terms of saving exported raw grain and timber, the Shanghai and Qingdao branches have been meticulous in their calculations, saving a substantial amount of wealth for the state. For example, for the cellophane noodles exported from Qingdao, in the past, every 300 jin of mung beans would only produce 100 jin of finished product. After the Qingdao branch and related supplier units jointly researched and improved the processing, an average of 6 to 10 jin of mung beans could be saved for every 100 jin of cellophane noodles. The actual savings for the year amounted to 570,000 jin of mung beans, equivalent to approximately 68,400 yuan. Many inland companies are generally able to adopt various different saving measures based on the characteristics of each stage of commodity circulation and in conjunction with the specific conditions of their province. For example, Jilin and Fujian provinces have already achieved good results in reducing intermediate links and purchasing directly from production units. After obtaining the support of local Party and government leaders and consulting with supplier units, the Jilin Provincial Branch has enabled direct procurement for some commodities. For example, pine nuts supplied to fraternal countries used to go through four links: the county forestry bureau, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperative, the county supply and marketing cooperative, and the provincial cooperative. The expenses incurred for this amounted to 19% of the value of the goods. In the second half of last year, direct procurement from the county forestry bureau saved 56,000 yuan for this commodity alone. The entire administrative management expenses of the Jilin Provincial Branch are only 30,000 yuan per year. Some provincial companies have adopted a method combining on-site acceptance at the place of production and direct shipment, which has reduced the damage rate of goods, reduced freight and transportation mileage, and accelerated the company's capital turnover. For example, after the Shanxi Provincial Branch adopted on-site acceptance for four commodities supplied for export, such as peach kernels, apricot kernels, and white melon seeds, in the second half of the year, the damage rate decreased from 1%-1.25% to 0.5%, saving 47,000 yuan in transportation costs, and shortening the transportation time from fifteen days to seven days. In addition, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Jilin provinces have all implemented measures for on-site processing and direct shipment of certain commodities based on the conditions of their province, which has greatly reduced costs and losses, and saved a substantial amount of funds for the state. Many provincial and municipal companies also have many methods for overcoming difficulties and improving packaging. For example, in the past, the wooden crates used in Shaanxi, Hebei, and Shanxi to package peach kernels weighed up to 100 jin. The price of each crate was around four to five yuan, and it could only be used once. In order to overcome the shortage of packaging timber, Shaanxi and Shanxi, with the strong assistance of the Tianjin branch, switched to using cardboard boxes. In use, they also increased the utilization rate of the cardboard boxes by one to two times, which alone saved the state more than 2,300 cubic meters of timber and 65,700 yuan.
    Facts prove that as long as we mobilize the masses, use our brains, and carefully calculate, we can save a substantial amount of wealth for the state. If the import and export commodities operated by the China National Native Produce Export Corporation can pay attention to streamlining and saving at every stage of domestic and international circulation, for example, saving one or two fen on the value of each kilogram of goods, then what is saved will not be hundreds of thousands or millions, but tens of millions, or even more wealth can be saved.

    每个流转环节都有节约潜力
    张建平
    中国土产出口公司所属各省、市和口岸公司增产节约的潜力极大。许多事实证明，在每个商品流转所必需的环节上都有节约的可能。如去年一年中仅河北、吉林、陕西、天津、上海等十二个单位在木材、粉丝、桃仁、蜂蜜、甜菜粕和米粉干等十种商品的国内流转费用上，由于调动了一部分可能调动的积极因素，改善了经营管理，就为国家节约一百六十二万九千元；此外，因为及时清理仓库残损物资，仅黑木耳和辣椒干两种商品就给国家挽回损失四千八百多万元。
    在节约出口原粮和木材方面，上海、青岛分公司精打细算，为国家节省了大量财富。如青岛出口的粉丝，过去加工每三百斤绿豆才出一百斤成品，经过青岛分公司和有关供货单位共同研究改进了加工以后，平均每百斤粉丝就可节约六斤到十斤绿豆，全年实际节省绿豆五十七万斤，约合六万八千四百元。不少的内地公司，大都能根据每个商品流转的环节和特点，结合本省的具体条件，采取各种不同的节约措施。如吉林和福建两省在减少中间环节、从生产单位直接进货方面已经取得很好的成绩。吉林省分公司在取得当地党政领导的支持并和供货单位协商以后，做到使部分商品直接进货。如供应兄弟国家的松子，过去要经过县农林局、基层供销社、县供销社和省社四个环节，为此而付出的费用等于货价的19％；去年下半年由县农林局直接进货，仅此一项商品就节约费用五万六千元。而吉林省公司的全年行政管理费用也不过三万元。有的省公司采用了产地验收和直线发运相结合的办法，商品的损耗率降低了，运费和运输的里程减少了，公司的资金周转也快了，如山西省公司下半年供应出口的桃仁、杏仁和白瓜子等四种商品采取产地验收后，损耗率由1％—1.25％降低为0.5％，节约了运输费用四万七千元，运输时间由十五天缩短为七天。此外，陕西、甘肃和吉林等省也都根据本省条件对某些商品推行了产地加工和直线发运的措施，大大减低了费用和损耗，为国家节约了大量资金。许多省、市公司在克服困难改进包装方面的办法也是很多的。如过去陕西、河北和山西包装桃仁用的木箱都重达百斤。每个箱的价格在四元到五元左右，而且只能使用一次。陕西、山西为了克服包装木料不足的困难，在天津分公司大力帮助下，改用了纸箱包装，在使用中并提高了纸箱的使用率一倍到二倍，仅此一项即给国家节约了二千三百多立方公尺木材和六万五千七百元。
    事实证明，只要发动群众，开动脑筋，精打细算，就可为国家节约大量财富。中国土产出口公司所经营的进出口商品，如能在国内外流转的每个环节上注意精简节约，例如在每公斤商品的数值上节约一分或二分，那么所节约的将不是几十万，几百万，而是几千万，甚或可以节约更多的财富。
