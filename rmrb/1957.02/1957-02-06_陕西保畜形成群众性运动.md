Shaanxi's Livestock Protection Forms Mass Movement

    (Reported by our newspaper) Shaanxi Province has listed livestock protection as a central task in the busy preparations for spring plowing. Various special districts and counties have inspected livestock protection work and made many improvements. The work of protecting and cherishing livestock has formed a mass movement in rural areas.

    In order to completely reverse the serious situation of widespread weakness and leanness, increased mortality, and reduced breeding of draft animals, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China required party leaders in various localities to personally take charge, adopt emergency measures before spring plowing, conduct thorough trough-by-trough inspections in rural areas, and specifically help agricultural cooperatives solve problems in livestock protection work, and vigorously carry out livestock protection and love livestock campaigns through various gatherings. At present, according to statistics from sixteen counties including Wugong, Tongchuan, Chunhua, Changwu, Liquan, Qianxian, and Xingping, more than 1,200 cadres have been dispatched to conduct trough-by-trough inspections and assistance work in agricultural cooperatives. Many counties have convened draft animal health appraisal meetings at the township level, launched livestock protection and love livestock campaign months, held training classes for breeders, and adopted various livestock protection measures. In some areas, the phenomenon of livestock weakness and leanness has been initially reversed. For example, Wugong County has repaired and newly built more than 1,300 feeding rooms, and agricultural cooperatives throughout the county have also assigned draft animals to various production teams (groups) based on land area. As a result, the county's current draft animal feeding management, work system, winter cold protection equipment, and the solution of livestock trough crowding and the placement of breeders have all achieved significant results.

    After the Spring Festival, various parts of Shaanxi Province plan to hold meetings of advanced workers in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine in order to exchange experiences and further promote the work of protecting and cherishing livestock and breeding large numbers of livestock.

    陕西保畜形成群众性运动
    本报讯　陕西省在繁忙的备耕活动中，把保畜工作列为当前的一项中心工作。各专区、县纷纷对保畜工作进行检查，并作了许多改进。保畜爱畜工作已在农村中形成群众性运动。
    为了彻底扭转耕畜普遍乏瘦和死亡增多繁殖减少的严重情况，中共陕西省委要求各地党的领导亲自动手，在春耕前采取紧急措施，深入农村逐槽检查，具体帮助农业社解决保畜工作中的问题，利用各种集会大力开展保畜爱畜运动。目前，据武功、铜川、淳化、长武、醴泉、乾县、兴平等十六个县统计，共抽调了一千二百多名干部，分片深入农业社进行逐槽检查和帮助工作。不少县以乡为单位召开了耕畜健康评比大会，开展了保畜爱畜运动月，举办了饲养员训练班和采取了各种保畜措施。某些地区已初步扭转牲畜乏瘦现象。如武功县修补和新盖了饲养室一千三百多个，全县农业社并将耕畜按地亩搭配包给了各个生产队（组）。因此全县目前耕畜的饲养管理、使役制度、过冬的防寒设备以及解决牲口夹槽和安置饲养员等工作都有了显著成绩。
    春节过后，陕西省各地计划召开畜牧兽医先进工作者会议，以便交流经验，使保畜爱畜和大量繁殖牲畜的工作更进一步开展起来。
