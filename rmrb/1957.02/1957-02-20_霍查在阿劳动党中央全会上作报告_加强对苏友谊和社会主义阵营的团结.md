Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 19th. TASS, Tirana, 17th: The Tirana newspapers published the report on the international situation and the tasks of the party made by Hoxha, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party.

    In his report, Hoxha first talked about the general international situation and focused on the aggressive activities of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel. Speaking of the Hungarian incident, he said that the Soviet Union helped the Hungarian people defeat the enemy, defend freedom, independence, the people's regime, and socialism. Therefore, the Soviet Union fulfilled its lofty internationalist duty and made a great contribution to the cause of socialism and the communist movement.

    Hoxha then spoke of the Soviet Union's leading role in the communist movement and the issue of learning from Soviet experience. He said that our party has held a correct attitude towards this fundamental issue since the first day of its establishment. Our relationship with the Soviet Union is built on the basis of Leninism, complete equality, fraternal mutual assistance and respect for national sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. It is built on the basis of proletarian internationalism and the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet Union's friendship and fraternal assistance to us, as well as the unity of the socialist camp, guarantee our country's national sovereignty, independence, and socialist construction. Our people have learned from Soviet experience in the past and will continue to do so in the future. At the same time, we will also apply the experiences of other countries. However, Soviet experience is a guiding light for us.

    Hoxha spoke about relations with Yugoslavia. He criticized certain arguments of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and then said that we will maintain and strengthen the sincere friendship with the Yugoslav people. We have always advocated improving and normalizing state relations with Yugoslavia on the basis of equality and non-interference in internal affairs.

    Finally, Hoxha also talked about the tasks of the Albanian Labor Party and the people of the whole country. He said that we should now and in the future strive to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and consolidate the eternal fraternal friendship with the Soviet people by all means. Our strength lies here, and the source of our people's victory lies here. We must protect the unity of our party ranks like the apple of our eye.

    霍查在阿劳动党中央全会上作报告
    加强对苏友谊和社会主义阵营的团结
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社地拉那17日讯：地拉那各报刊载了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查所作的关于国际局势和党的任务的报告。
    霍查在报告中首先谈到总的国际局势，并且着重谈到了英、法、以三国的侵略活动。他在谈到匈牙利事件时说，苏联帮助匈牙利人民击败了敌人，保卫住了自由、独立、人民政权和社会主义，因而苏联执行了它的崇高的国际主义职责，对社会主义和共产主义运动的事业做出了巨大的贡献。
    霍查接着谈到苏联在共产主义运动中的领导作用和学习苏联经验的问题。他说，我们党从成立的第一天起对这个根本问题就抱着正确的态度。我们同苏联的关系是建筑在列宁主义的完全平等、兄弟互助和尊重国家主权，互不干涉内政的原则基础上的，是建筑在无产阶级国际主义和马克思列宁主义原则基础上的。苏联对我们的友谊和兄弟援助，以及社会主义阵营的团结保证了我国的国家主权、独立和社会主义建设。我国人民过去和将来都要以苏联的经验为师。同时，我们也将运用别国的经验。然而，苏联的经验对我们来说则是指路明灯。
    霍查谈到了同南斯拉夫的关系，他批评了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人的某些论点，然后他说，我们将维护和加强同南斯拉夫人民的真诚友谊。我们一贯主张根据平等和不干涉内政的原则改善同南斯拉夫的国家关系，并且使它正常化起来。
    霍查最后还谈到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和全国人民的任务。他说，我们现在和将来都应当为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结而斗争，用一切方法巩固同苏联人民的永恒的兄弟友谊。我们的力量就在这里，我国人民胜利的泉源就在这里。必须像保护眼珠一样保护我们党的队伍的团结。
