Xinhua News Agency, 21st, New York Dispatch: The United Nations Security Council, at its meeting on the 20th, voted on a proposal by the US, Britain, and four other nations regarding the Kashmir issue (this proposal advocated considering the dispatch of a United Nations temporary force to Kashmir to achieve the “demilitarization” of the region) and a Soviet amendment to the proposal. The Soviet amendment was rejected, and the Soviet Union also vetoed the four-nation proposal.

After the four-nation proposal was rejected, the United States, along with Britain, Australia, and Cuba, immediately put forward a new proposal. This proposal suggested sending the President of the Security Council, Swedish representative Jarring, to India and Pakistan to study "any suggestions he deems helpful in resolving the dispute," and that Jarring should submit a report to the Security Council no later than April 15.

Sobolev spoke at the meeting, accusing the new US proposal of merely being a repetition of the previous proposal that India could not accept, and stated that he would have to vote against this new proposal again.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th, New York Dispatch: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continues to discuss the Cyprus issue.

At the meeting on the 19th, Ceylon's representative Gooneratne supported the Cypriot people's demand for self-determination in his speech. Yugoslav representative Ninčić expressed opposition to the British proposal and support for the Greek proposal to grant Cypriots the right to self-determination.

At the meeting on the 20th, Syrian representative Niding, in his speech, condemned Britain's colonial policies and demanded that the Cypriot people be given the right to self-determination. Romanian representative Joja said that Britain's rule in Cyprus was completely colonial, and the desire of the Greeks of Cyprus to strive for freedom and independence could not be ignored. He believed that the United Nations had every right to deal with the issue of national self-determination in Cyprus.

US representative Wadsworth spoke in defense of Britain's colonialist position. French representative Georges-Picot also opposed the Greek proposal to grant the Cypriot people the right to self-determination and believed that the United Nations had no right to deal with the Cyprus issue.

    安理会就克什米尔问题进行表决
    苏联否决美英等四国提案
    联大政委会继续讨论塞浦路斯问题
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会在20日的会议上就美英等四国关于克什米尔问题的提案（这个提案主张考虑派遣联合国临时部队去克什米尔以实现这个地区的“非军事化”）和苏联就这个提案提出的修正案进行了表决。苏联的修正案遭到否决，苏联也否决了四国提案。
    在四国提案被否决之后，美国又联合英国、澳大利亚和古巴立即提出一项新提案。这项提案建议派遣安全理事会主席、瑞典代表雅林前往印度和巴基斯坦研究“在他看来可能有助于解决争端的任何建议”，并且要雅林至迟在4月15日以前向安理会提出报告。
    索波列夫在会上发言，指责美国的新提案只是先前印度所不能接受的那个提案的重复，并表示他将不得不再投票反对这项新提案。
    据新华社20日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论塞浦路斯问题。
    在19日会议上锡兰代表古纳尼地尼在发言中支持塞浦路斯人民的自决要求。南斯拉夫代表宁契奇表示反对英国的提案而支持希腊提出的要求给予塞浦路斯人以自决权的提案。
    在20日会议上，叙利亚代表尼丁在发言中指责英国的殖民政策，并且要求给予塞浦路斯人民自决权。罗马尼亚代表若扎说，英国在塞浦路斯的统治完全是殖民主义的，塞浦路斯的希腊人争取自由和独立的愿望不容漠视。他认为联合国完全有权处理塞浦路斯实行民族自决的问题。
    美国代表华兹沃斯发言为英国的殖民主义立场辩护。法国代表乔治—皮科也反对希腊要求给予塞浦路斯人民以自决权的提案，并且认为联合国无权处理塞浦路斯问题。
