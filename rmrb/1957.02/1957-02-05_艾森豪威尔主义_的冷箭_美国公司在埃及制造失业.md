    The newspaper also said that American TWA has also been planning to dismiss some other Egyptian workers, but has not done so due to pressure from the Egyptian authorities.

The newspaper then pointed out that the American Ford Motor Company in Alexandria recently dismissed about four hundred workers and threatened to end its operations in Egypt.

    新华社开罗电　据“共和国报”1日报道，美国在埃及的一些公司对埃及雇员采取了歧视措施。
    “共和国报”说，美国环球航空公司解雇了三十名埃及雇员，而别国的雇员却一个也没有动。
    这家报纸说，埃及当局已经对这件事进行了干预，美国环球航空公司的代表和埃及当局正在研究这件事情。
    这家报纸又说，美国环球航空公司还一直打算解雇另外一些埃及的工人，但是由于受到埃及当局的压力还没有这样做。
    这家报纸指出，有消息说，关于解雇埃及工人的决定是受到某方面的指使的，其目的是为了在埃及制造失业者。这家报纸接着指出，亚历山大的美国福特汽车公司最近解雇了约四百名工人，并且扬言要结束它在埃及的营业。
