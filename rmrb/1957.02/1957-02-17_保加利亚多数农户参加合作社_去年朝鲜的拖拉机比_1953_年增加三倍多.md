Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 16th -- According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, Bulgarian agriculture has made great achievements in realizing collectivization and mechanization.

    At present, there are more than 3,100 agricultural production cooperatives in Bulgaria, with about 950,000 farm households participating, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of farm households in the country. The cultivated land area of the cooperatives is about 36 million decares (each decare is equal to 1.5 mu), accounting for nearly 80% of the total cultivated land area in the country. In 1956 alone, a total of 356 new agricultural cooperatives were established, and more than 40 new cooperatives were established in January 1957.
    In terms of agricultural mechanization, in 1956, Bulgarian agriculture obtained 6,790 new tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower each), 986 combine harvesters (of which 490 were produced domestically), and more than 6,600 other agricultural machines. At present, there are 208 machine tractor stations in the country, owning about 20,000 tractors, about 4,000 combine harvesters, and many other agricultural machines. In 1956, the amount of work completed by the machine tractor stations for the agricultural production cooperatives increased by 28% compared to 1955. Every year, Bulgaria receives a large number of agricultural machines from the Soviet Union.
    Bulgarian agriculture obtains more and more chemical fertilizers from domestic chemical industrial enterprises every year. In the past year, agriculture obtained 189,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, 51% more than in 1955.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th -- According to the Korean Central News Agency: At the end of 1956, the final year of the post-war three-year plan, the number of tractors owned by North Korea had increased to 4.75 times that of 1953. During the three-year plan period, 32 new agricultural machine rental stations were established in the country. The land cultivation target set by the three-year plan for machine rental stations has been overfulfilled by 3.6%.
    A report presented at the ongoing conference of North Korean agricultural machine rental station chiefs also mentioned that great progress has been made in the mechanization of field work such as leveling, sowing, weeding, harvesting, and threshing. Compared with 1954, the area of land sown by machines in 1956 expanded by 13,400 hectares (one hectare equals 15 mu).

    保加利亚多数农户参加合作社
    去年朝鲜的拖拉机比1953年增加三倍多
    新华社索非亚16日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道，保加利亚的农业在实现合作化和机械化方面取得了巨大成就。
    现在，保加利亚全国共有三千一百多个农业生产合作社，入社农户约九十五万户，占全国农户总数的80％以上，合作社耕地面积约有三千六百万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半），占全国耕地总面积近80％。在1956年一年中，总共建立了三百五十六个新的农业合作社，1957年1月又建立了四十多个新的合作社。
    在农业机械化方面，1956年，保加利亚的农业获得了六千七百九十台新的拖拉机（以每台十五马力计算），九百八十六台收割联合机（其中四百九十台是本国生产的）和六千六百多台其他的农业机器。现在，全国共有二百零八个机器拖拉机站，拥有约两万台拖拉机、约四千台收割联合机和许多其他农业机器。1956年农业生产合作社由机器拖拉机站的机器来完成的工作量比1955年增加了28％。每年保加利亚都从苏联得到大量的农业机器。
    保加利亚的农业每年从本国的化学工业企业得到越来越多的化学肥料。在过去一年里，农业获得了十八万九千吨化学肥料，比1955年多51％。
    据新华社平壤16日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：在战后三年计划的最后一年——1956年年底，朝鲜所拥有的拖拉机的数目已经增加到1953年的四点七五倍。在三年计划期间，这个国家新建立了三十二个农业机器代耕站。三年计划为机器代耕站所规定的耕田指标已经超额完成了3.6％。
    目前正在举行的朝鲜农业机器代耕站站长会议上提出的一项报告还谈到了在平地、播种、除草、收割和打禾等田间工作的机械化方面也有了很大的进展。和1954年比较，1956年用机器播种的土地面积扩大了一万三千四百公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）。
