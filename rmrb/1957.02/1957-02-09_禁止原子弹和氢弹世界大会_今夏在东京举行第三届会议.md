Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th. Yasui Kaoru, Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said in Aomori today that the Third World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has decided to be held in Tokyo this summer, and preparations are currently underway.

Yasui arrived in Aomori yesterday to attend lectures against atomic and hydrogen bombs held in six cities within Aomori Prefecture.

He told reporters that regarding the issue of preventing the UK from conducting nuclear weapons tests on Christmas Island, we intend to mobilize anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb councils across the country in the future to launch a strong national movement and appeal to world public opinion.

The Nagasaki Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has already sent a protest letter to British Prime Minister Macmillan yesterday to stop Britain from conducting nuclear weapons tests. At the same time, the council will launch a campaign in Nagasaki City from February 20 to collect 150,000 signatures against British nuclear weapons testing.
