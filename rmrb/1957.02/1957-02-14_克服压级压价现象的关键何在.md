What is the Key to Overcoming the Phenomena of Underrating and Price Depression?
    Yan Kejie

    In the past, the supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhangjiakou Special District had a very serious problem of underrating and price depression in their procurement operations. Especially since the procurement business entered its peak season in the fourth quarter of last year, more and more incidents of underrating and price depression have been exposed in newspapers and letters from the people. Fan Shizhong, a farmer from Sujiaqiao, Wanquan County, sold 200 jin of dried ephedra to the local supply and marketing cooperative. The purchasing agent, Pei Ju, insisted on pricing it as wet goods at 1.6 fen per jin. Later, Fan Shizhong did not sell it and took the dried ephedra to the Zhangjiakou Special District Cooperative, where he sold it for 4 fen per jin, a total of 4.8 yuan more than the local supply and marketing cooperative would have paid. From January to July last year, the Chicheng County Cooperative purchased more than 32,200 jin of wool. The purchasing unit obtained an excess profit of 3,557 yuan through overweighing and price depression. The Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the same county overweighed 100 jin when purchasing 400 jin of wool. In the third quarter of last year, the Guyuan County Cooperative purchased 3,200 jin of mushrooms, with a purchase-sale margin as high as 50%. As a result, more and more farmers are unwilling to sell their products to the supply and marketing cooperatives. In particular, since the opening of the free market, the procurement business of the supply and marketing cooperatives has declined sharply. According to statistics, the total procurement value of the entire special district in October last year was more than 1.29 million yuan, a decrease of 83.6% compared to September. The total procurement value in November decreased by another 10.7% compared to October. This sharp decline in procurement business during the peak season is obviously not conducive to revitalizing the urban and rural economy.

    The Zhangjiakou Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative attached importance to this issue. In early November last year, it sent cadres to Zhuolu County to focus on inspecting the reasons for the underrating and price depression caused by the county cooperative and grassroots cooperatives in their procurement business. After research, it was found that: 1. There are many operating links, the profit distribution is unreasonable, with more going to the upper levels and less to the lower levels; the grassroots cooperatives cannot solve their own operating expenses, so they focus on the farmers; 2. The technical level is low, and many purchasing personnel always err on the side of caution when inspecting products, fearing that the supply and marketing cooperatives will suffer losses.

    Last year, the procurement business of the Zhangjiakou Special District Cooperative increased by 81% compared with 1955, which shows that the higher-level cooperatives have gradually concentrated the well-managed businesses at the top. For some locally produced and sold products, the grassroots cooperatives originally had the conditions to directly organize production and sales meetings, but the special district cooperative and county cooperative also intervened in layer-by-layer operations. For example, Xuanhua County produces *zhijicao* (枳机草). Because the special district cooperative and county cooperative operated it, the selling price of the special district cooperative increased to 8 fen per jin, twice as high as the price the grassroots cooperative purchased from the farmers. As the number of operating links increases, profits are squeezed at each level in the profit distribution. According to the three-level profit (margin) distribution of the Zhangjiakou Special District Cooperative, Zhangbei County Cooperative, and Zhangbei County Gonghui Grassroots Cooperative, the special district cooperative's profit margin for operating mushrooms is 35.5%, the county cooperative gets 8.9%, and the grassroots cooperative only gets 5%; the special district cooperative's profit margin for operating waste bones is 22.5%, the county cooperative gets 8.89%, and the grassroots cooperative only gets 4%. Because the grassroots cooperatives get too little profit, they are criticized if they lose money, and in serious cases, they have to make self-criticisms and be punished. Under this unreasonable profit distribution, coupled with the organizational pressure from the higher-level cooperatives, the grassroots cooperatives have only one way to go, which is to underrate and depress prices when purchasing products.

    Secondly, although the issue of improving the technical level of purchasing personnel is very important, it can only be effective if the above issue is truly resolved. Last year, the special district cooperative and county cooperative conducted two or three rounds of training for procurement staff for livestock products, Chinese medicinal materials, local products, and waste products, which have high requirements for inspection technology. About 300 grassroots cooperative procurement personnel received training, but the phenomenon of underrating and price depression did not decrease as a result.

    In response to these problems, the Zhangjiakou Special District Cooperative held a meeting of procurement section chiefs of various county cooperatives on November 23 last year, focusing on the following measures, which initially solved the problem.

    The first is to reduce operating links and decentralize business, reducing the entire procurement business by one to two links. Some locally produced and sold products that were previously operated by the special district cooperative and county cooperative were completely handed over to the grassroots cooperative level for operation. Products that are adjusted within the scope of the province and special district are operated by the county cooperative. The special district cooperative only operates large-scale products for long-distance sales. After this division, the Zhangjiakou Special District Cooperative took the lead in decentralizing about 30 types of products, including vermicelli, flour noodles, waste bones, hemp rope ends, old shoes, rags, and some local products and wild animals and plants, completely to lower-level cooperatives, and stipulated that all products operated by the special district cooperative should also go through only one link of the county cooperative or grassroots cooperative instead of intervening at each level. Seeing that the special district cooperative had decentralized business, the county cooperatives also proposed plans for business decentralization. The Zhuolu County Cooperative also decentralized knitted products and some livestock products that the grassroots cooperatives had the conditions to operate. Because the business was decentralized at each level, reducing operating links, everyone felt that the business would be easier to do in the future. At this meeting, 60 purchase and sale contracts for local and sideline products were signed between county cooperatives and between county cooperatives and special district cooperatives, totaling 1.86 million yuan. Secondly, resolutely adjust the unreasonable profit distribution to ensure that grassroots cooperatives have reasonable income. According to the principle of "less at the top and more at the bottom," the profit regulations for general purchased commodities are: special district cooperative 1.7%, county cooperative 1.8%, grassroots cooperative 2%; the profit regulations for supplied commodities are: special district cooperative 0.8%-1.2%, county cooperative 1.95%, grassroots cooperative 2.35%. The results of the implementation over the past two months have proved that this measure has played a great role in further encouraging the operating enthusiasm of lower-level cooperatives and correcting underrating and price depression. Third, adjust unreasonable purchase prices. In the past, the special district cooperative controlled the purchase prices too tightly and too much. In order to adjust the purchase price of a product, lower-level cooperatives often had to go through many cumbersome procedures and could not get a timely reply from the higher-level cooperative, which affected the development of the business. The special district cooperative also decentralized its authority based on this situation. Except for commodities that are uniformly managed by the province and special district, which are still controlled by the special district cooperative, the prices of other products are controlled by whoever operates them. At the same time, the Zhangjiakou Special District Cooperative also took the lead in adjusting the prices of 72 types of products, with an average upward adjustment of 10%. After the meeting, the county cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives also adjusted the prices of 50 to 100 types of products in a timely manner, so that the posted price was initially close to the market price. Fourth, continue to train and develop technical cadres. The Longguan County Cooperative sent technicians to the grassroots cooperatives to adopt the "rotating guidance" method to help purchasing personnel eliminate the phenomenon of fluctuating prices. The special district cooperative also plans to hold a comprehensive technical training class in the first quarter of this year, with the county cooperative as the unit. In order to ensure that purchasing personnel gradually learn professional skills, their work will not be easily transferred in the future.

    Through the above measures, not only has the phenomenon of underrating and price depression in the procurement business been initially eliminated, but the business has also expanded. The total procurement value of the entire special district in late December last year reached more than 556,000 yuan, an increase of 50% compared to the previous ten days. In early January this year, the total value of products such as waste pig iron, mats, vermicelli, flax fiber, and wool increased by an average of 20% to 50% compared to late December last year.

    克服压级压价现象的关键何在
    阎可阶
    张家口专区各地供销社，过去在收购业务上的压级压价现象十分严重。特别是去年第四季收购业务进入旺季以来，从报纸上和人民来信中揭发出来的压级压价事件越来越多。万全县苏家桥农民范世忠卖给当地供销社二百斤干麻黄草，收购员裴举硬按湿货价格每斤一分六厘作价，后来范世忠没有卖，又把这些干麻黄草拿到张家口专区社以每斤四分的价钱卖了，合计比当地供销社多卖四元八角。赤城县社去年1至7月份收购三万二千二百多斤羊毛，收购单位因涨秤和压价就取得超额利润三千五百五十七元；该县城关供销社收购四百斤羊毛就涨秤一百斤。沽源县社去年第三季收购三千二百斤蘑菇，购、销差率高达50％。因此，越来越多的农民不愿意把产品卖给供销社了。特别是开放自由市场以来，供销社收购业务急剧下降。据统计，去年10月份全专区收购总值为一百二十九万多元，比9月份下降了83.6％；11月份的收购总值又比10月份下降了10.7％。这种旺季收购业务急剧下降的现象显然是不利于活跃城乡经济的。
    张家口专区供销社重视了这个问题，在去年11月初派干部到涿鹿县，重点检查了县社和基层社在收购业务上造成压级压价的原因。经过研究，发现：一、经营环节多，利润分配不合理，上多下少；基层社无法解决本单位的费用开支，因而在农民身上打主意；二、技术水平低，不少收购人员在验收产品时总是宁低勿高，怕供销社吃亏。
    去年，张家口专区社的收购业务比1955年增加81％，这说明了上级社逐渐把好经营的业务集中到上面来了。有些地产地销的产品，基层社本来有条件直接组织产销见面，但专区社和县社也要插手层层经营。如宣化县出产的枳机草，由于专区社和县社经营了，结果，专区社的出售价增加到每斤八分，比基层社向农民收购的价格高出一倍。经营环节增多了，在利润分配上就层层剥皮。根据张家口专区社、张北县社和张北县公会基层社的三级利润（差率）分配看，经营蘑菇，专区社所得差率为35.5％，县社得8.9％，基层社只得5％；经营废骨，专区社所得差率为22.5％，县社得8.89％，基层社只得4％。由于基层社所得利润太少，赔了钱还要受批评，重者还得作检查、受处分，在这种利润分配不合理的情况下，加上上级社给予组织上的压力，基层社只有一条路可走，就是收购产品时压级压价。
    其次，提高收购人员的技术水平问题虽然很重要，但是必须在真正解决了上一问题的基础上，才能见效。去年专区社和县社对检验技术要求较高的畜产品、中药材、土产、废品等收购工作人员曾经普遍进行过二、三次训练，约有三百多基层社收购人员受了训练，但是压级压价的现象并没有因此而减少。
    针对这些问题，张家口专区社在去年11月23日召开各县社采购科长会议，着重提出以下措施，初步解决了这个问题。
    首先是减少经营环节、下放业务，整个收购业务减少了一至二个环节。把过去由专区社和县社经营的某些地产地销的产品完全交由基层社一级经营；省和专区范围调剂的产品，由县社经营；专区社只经营大宗远销的产品。经过这样划分，张家口专区社带头把粉条、粉面、废骨、麻绳头、旧鞋、破布和一部分土产品、野生动植物约三十多种，完全下放到下级社经营，并规定凡专区社经营的产品，也只通过县社或基层社一个环节而不再层层插手。县社看到专区社业务下放了，也纷纷提出业务下放的计划，涿鹿县社把基层社有条件经营的编织品和一部分畜产品也下放了。由于业务层层下放，减少了经营环节，大家都感到今后业务好作了。在这次会议上县社和县社、专区社和县社之间就签订了六十份土副产品购销合同，总值一百八十六万元。其次，坚决调整不合理的利润分配，保证基层社有合理收入。根据“上少下多”的原则，对于一般收购商品的利润规定：专区社1.7％，县社1.8％，基层社2％；供应商品的利润规定：专区社0.8％—1.2％，县社1.95％，基层社2.35％。经过近两个月来执行的结果，证明这一措施对进一步鼓励下级社的经营积极性和纠正压级压价起了很大作用。第三，调整不合理的收购价格。过去专区社对收购价格管得过死、过多，下级社为了调整一种产品的收购价格，往往要经过很多繁琐的手续，还不能及时得到上级社的答复，影响了业务的开展。专区社根据这种情况，也下放了权限。除省、专区统一管理的商品仍由专区社掌握外，其余产品的价格，谁经营谁掌握。同时张家口专区社又带头调整了七十二种产品的价格，上调幅度平均为10％。会后，县社、基层社也及时调整了五十到一百种产品的价格，使牌市价初步接近吻合。第四，继续培养和训练技术干部。龙关县社派技术员到基层社采取“轮回辅导”的办法，帮助收购人员消除了作价忽高忽低的现象。专区社并且计划从今年第一季开始，以县社为单位，普遍举办一次综合性的技术训练班。为了保证收购人员逐步学好专业技术，对他们的工作，今后不作轻易调动。
    通过以上措施，不仅初步消除了收购业务中的压级压价现象，而且业务也扩大了。全专区去年12月下旬收购总值达到五十五万六千多元，比前一旬增加了50％；今年1月上旬收购废生铁、席子、粉条、胡麻纤维、羊毛等产品的总值又比去年12月下旬平均上升20％至50％。
