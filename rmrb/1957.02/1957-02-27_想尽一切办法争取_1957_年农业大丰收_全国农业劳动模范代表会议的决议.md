    Make Every Effort to Strive for a Great Agricultural Harvest in 1957
    – Resolution of the National Conference of Model Agricultural Workers –
    We – all the representatives attending the National Conference of Model Agricultural Workers, unanimously respond to Chairman Mao's call to make every effort to strive for a great agricultural harvest in 1957!
    1956 was a year of great victory. Thanks to the wise leadership of the CCP Central Committee, the State Council, and our great leader Chairman Mao, our nation's socialist construction事业事业 achieved extremely great victories during this year. In agriculture, agricultural cooperation was realized nationwide, and on the basis of cooperation, the collective strength of the vast number of peasants was brought into play to overcome serious disasters. Except for cotton production, which was roughly the same as in 1955, the output of grain and other major crops increased significantly compared to the bumper year of 1955.
    On the basis of the great victory in 1956, the conditions for agricultural increase in 1957 are even more favorable. After listening to the speeches of the leading comrades at this National Conference of Model Agricultural Workers, our thinking has been elevated and our confidence has been further enhanced. At this conference, advanced experiences were also widely exchanged, and we learned many useful things from each other. 1957 is the second year after the realization of cooperation nationwide. Our experience is still insufficient, and we will encounter certain difficulties on the road ahead. We must learn humbly, never be arrogant, and work and learn together with all peasant brothers to overcome difficulties. According to the principles of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, we will improve the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives, make the cooperatives better, and launch a broader and more solid large-scale production movement in rural areas across the country.
    In order to achieve a great agricultural harvest in 1957, it is necessary to continue to actively build water conservancy projects, accumulate and produce fertilizer, promote improved varieties, expand multiple cropping, change farming systems, improve farming techniques, and so on. These are the main ways to increase crop yields at present. As for which measures or which measures each locality and cooperative should focus on as the key to increasing production in their respective areas and cooperatives, and how to implement these measures, it should not be the same everywhere. Each locality and cooperative should make decisions after democratic discussions among the masses based on their specific conditions, and then implement them. Do not mechanically copy anything that is not suitable for the specific conditions of the local cooperative. Anything that is suitable for the specific conditions of the local cooperative and is effective must be actively promoted.
    In 1957, the state's preliminary planned targets require that the total grain output (excluding soybeans) reach 395 billion jin, the total cotton output reach 33 million dan, the number of pigs reach 120 million, and other economic crops, animal husbandry production, forestry production, fishery production, and sideline production should all have considerable development. The National Conference of Model Agricultural Workers believes that these requirements of the state plan should be achieved and can be achieved. We are determined to work hard with all peasant brothers to achieve them and strive to exceed them.
    All peasant brothers, all agricultural (forestry, animal husbandry, fishery) production cooperatives, all state-owned agricultural (pastoral, forestry, aquatic) enterprises, and all agricultural scientific and technical personnel, and rural workers! The spring plowing season is approaching. Let us all act together and strive to realize the glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao. Make every effort to strive for a great agricultural harvest in 1957, so that agricultural cooperatives will be more consolidated, the lives of peasants will be further improved, and the country's industrialization and socialist construction will be more powerfully supported! Let us move forward with confidence! By all means and through hard work, a great agricultural harvest in 1957 will definitely be achieved.　February 26, 1957

    想尽一切办法争取1957年农业大丰收
    ——全国农业劳动模范代表会议的决议——
    我们——出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的全体代表，一致响应毛主席的号召，一定要想尽一切办法，为争取1957年的农业大丰收而奋斗！
    1956年是伟大胜利的一年。由于中共中央、国务院和我们伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导，我们国家的社会主义建设事业，在这一年期间，获得了极其伟大的胜利。农业方面，在全国范围内实现了农业合作化，并且在合作化的基础上，发挥了广大农民的集体力量，战胜了严重的灾害，除了棉花的产量同1955年大体相平以外，粮食和其他主要农作物的产量，比丰收的1955年还有显著的增加。
    在1956年伟大胜利的基础上，1957年农业增产的条件是更为有利了。在这次全国农业劳动模范代表会议上，听了各位首长的讲话，我们的思想提高了，信心更加增强了。在这次会议上，也广泛地交流了先进经验，我们互相学到了许多有益的东西。1957年是在全国范围内实现了合作化的第二年，我们的经验还很不够，在前进的道路上还会遇到一定的困难。我们一定要虚心学习，决不骄傲，跟全体农民弟兄一起，边做边学，克服困难，按照勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，改进农业合作社的经营管理工作，把合作社办得更好，在全国农村中，展开一个更广泛更踏实的大生产运动。
    为了实现1957年的农业大丰收，必须继续积极地兴修水利、积肥造肥、推广良种、扩大复种、改变耕作制度、改进耕作技术，等等。这是当前增加农作物产量的主要途径。至于各个地方、各个合作社，究竟抓那一项措施或者那几项措施，做为本地本社增产的关键？究竟怎样实行这些措施？绝不是到处一样的，应该由各地、各社根据自己的具体条件，经过群众民主讨论，做出决定，然后实行。凡是不适合本地本社情况的，就不要机械照搬。凡是适合本地本社情况的，行之有效的，就必须积极推广。
    1957年，国家初步计划指标要求：粮食总产量（不包括大豆）达到三千九百五十亿斤，棉花总产量达到三千三百万担，猪达到一万二千万头，其他经济作物、畜牧业生产、山林生产、渔业生产和副业生产等都要有相当大的发展。全国农业劳动模范代表会议认为，国家计划的这些要求是应该达到的，而且能够达到的，我们决心，同全体农民弟兄一起，努力达到，并且力争超过。
    全体农民弟兄、各个农（林、牧、渔）业生产合作社、各个国营农业（牧业、林业、水产）企业、和一切农业科学技术人员、农村工作人员们！春耕季节就要到来了，我们大家一齐行动起来，努力实现毛主席所给我们的光荣任务，想尽一切办法，争取1957年农业大丰收，使农业合作社更加巩固起来，农民生活进一步获得改善，更有力地支援国家工业化，支援社会主义建设！充满信心地努力前进吧！千方百计，辛勤劳动，1957年的农业大丰收是一定能够实现的。　1957年2月26日
