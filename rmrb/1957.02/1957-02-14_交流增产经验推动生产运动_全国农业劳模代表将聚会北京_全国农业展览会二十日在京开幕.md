    Exchange Experience in Increasing Production and Promote the Production Movement
    National Agricultural Labor Model Representatives to Gather in Beijing
    National Agricultural Exhibition to Open in Beijing on the 20th
    (By this newspaper) The national agricultural labor model representative conference, to be held for the first time by the Ministry of Agriculture, will officially open on February 18. The participants in this conference include advanced individuals from agricultural, animal husbandry, and fishery production cooperatives from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country; representatives from advanced units such as state-owned farms and ranches, agricultural machine tractor stations, high-yield counties, districts, townships, agricultural technology extension stations, and secondary agricultural schools. The Tibet Autonomous Region has also sent outstanding representatives from agricultural production to participate in this conference. Building on the great victory achieved in agricultural production last year, the conference will exchange experiences in increasing production from various regions and further mobilize the vast number of farmers, rural workers, and agricultural scientists to launch a large-scale national production movement, striving for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1957.
    (By this newspaper) The first National Agricultural Exhibition in China is scheduled to officially open on February 20.
    This exhibition is jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Central Meteorological Bureau, and the Ministry of Aquatic Products.
    The exhibition is located in the Soviet Exhibition Center in the capital. All exhibits are divided into eleven pavilions, namely: Comprehensive Pavilion, Crop Pavilion One, Crop Pavilion Two, Increased Production Measures Pavilion (including six exhibition rooms for agricultural machinery, soil improvement, fertilizers, seeds, plant protection, and multiple cropping), Animal Husbandry Pavilion, State-owned Farm Pavilion, Tropical Crop Pavilion, Forestry Pavilion, Water Conservancy Pavilion, Meteorology Pavilion, and Aquatic Products Pavilion.
    From this exhibition, one can not only see the tremendous achievements made by our country in agricultural socialist transformation and agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and meteorology in recent years, but also see many valuable products abundant in various parts of our country. Various agricultural and water conservancy machinery are displayed on the east and west squares of the exhibition hall; the Meteorology Pavilion has an outdoor meteorological observation field; and various excellent breeds of livestock and poultry are also exhibited in the livestock sheds.
    In most of the pavilions of the exhibition, emphasis is placed on introducing many typical examples of high-yield and large-area bumper harvests.
    The exhibition will receive agricultural labor models and rural work cadres selected from all over the country to visit Beijing in batches and conduct technical exchanges.
