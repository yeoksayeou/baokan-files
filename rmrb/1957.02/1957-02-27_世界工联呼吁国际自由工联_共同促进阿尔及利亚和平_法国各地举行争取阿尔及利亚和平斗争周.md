Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 26th: A message released here on the 25th stated that Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, wrote to J.H. Oldenbroek, General Secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, on February 15th, calling for joint action to promote the realization of peace in Algeria.

The letter stated that in a statement to the ICFTU last June, the World Federation of Trade Unions expressed its support for any initiative from any trade union organization, as long as the purpose of the initiative is to establish the broadest possible concerted action among trade unions and working people of all countries to promote peace in Algeria and to promote the realization of the right to self-determination of the Algerian people.

Since then, the situation in Algeria has deteriorated, and the persecution of Algerian trade unions and people has intensified. The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at a recent meeting, pointed out that the development of the Algerian situation requires all working people and trade union organizations to take action. Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions considers it necessary to declare April 7th to 14th this year as an International Week of Solidarity and Struggle in support of the Algerian people.

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: According to TASS, Paris: Responding to the call of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, a week of struggle for peace in Algeria began throughout France on the 25th. The slogan of the week of struggle is: Demand a peaceful solution to the Algerian question based on recognition of the Algerian people's right to independence.

The main activities of the week of struggle include: holding meetings and mass rallies in Paris and the provinces; sending delegations to petition mayors, members of parliament, and the cabinet; and distributing leaflets and pamphlets calling for peace in Algeria.

    世界工联呼吁国际自由工联
    共同促进阿尔及利亚和平
    法国各地举行争取阿尔及利亚和平斗争周
    据新华社布拉格26日电　这里在25日发表的一则消息说，世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬2月15日写信给国际自由工会联合会总书记欧顿布洛克，呼吁采取共同行动来促进阿尔及利亚的和平的实现。
    信中说，世界工联去年6月曾经在一份给国际自由工联的声明中表示，它将支持来自任何工会组织的任何倡议，只要这个倡议的目的是在各个工会和各国劳动人民之间建立最广泛的一致行动，以促进阿尔及利亚的和平，促进阿尔及利亚人民实现他们的自决权。
    从那时以来，阿尔及利亚的局势恶化了，迫害阿尔及利亚工会和人民的行动也加剧了。世界工联执行委员会在最近举行的一次会议上指出，阿尔及利亚情势的发展要求一切劳动人民和各个工会组织行动起来。因此，世界工联认为有必要把今年4月7日到14日宣布为支持阿尔及利亚人民的国际团结和斗争周。
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：响应法国共产党中央委员会的号召，法国各地在25日开始举行争取阿尔及利亚和平的斗争周。斗争周的口号是：要求在承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利的基础上，和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    斗争周的主要活动有：在巴黎和各省举行会议和群众大会；派代表团向市长、议会议员和内阁请愿；散发要求在阿尔及利亚实现和平的传单和小册子。
