    Hope to Transfer Agricultural Technology Cadres to Strengthen the Technology Extension Stations
    Dare County, Shanxi Province (merged from the former Datong and Huairen counties), is a large county. This year, the entire county has basically achieved advanced collectivization. Agricultural cooperatives urgently need technical guidance in carrying out the great production movement. However, our county only has four agricultural technology extension stations and twenty technical cadres. The quality of the technical cadres is also very poor; only one graduated from a secondary agricultural professional school, and the rest only received three months of agricultural technical training after graduating from senior primary school, and are very lacking in agricultural scientific knowledge. Last year, the Provincial Department of Agriculture asked our county to build three new agricultural technology extension stations, but did not provide a single technical cadre. Last year, our county planted nearly 60,000 mu of "Golden Queen" corn, but the result was a general crop failure, with some not even tasseling. The reason is not that our county is unsuitable for planting "Golden Queen," but that the technical guidance work was done too poorly; the personnel of the technology extension stations had not studied the scientific technology of planting corn.
    Shanxi Province has an agricultural college and several agricultural schools, which produce hundreds of graduates every year. However, most of the graduates are assigned to the Provincial Department of Agriculture and other higher-level organizations. I hope that more technical personnel can be transferred from higher-level organizations to strengthen the technical extension stations below.　Lei Guowen

    希望抽调农业技术干部充实技术推广站
    山西省大仁县是个大县（由原大同、怀仁两县合并的）。今年全县已经基本上实现高级合作化了。农业社在开展大生产运动中，迫切需要技术指导。可是，我县仅有农业技术推广站四个，技术干部二十人。技术干部的质量也很差，只有一个是中级农业专业学校毕业的，其余都是高小毕业后只受了三个月农业技术训练，很缺乏农业科学知识。省农业厅去年要我县新建三个农业技术推广站，但没有给一个技术干部。去年我县种了“金皇后”玉米近六万亩，结果是普遍歉收，有的根本没有抽穗。其原因，不是我县不宜于种“金皇后”，而是技术指导工作做得太差，技术推广站的人员，都没有学过种植玉米的科学技术。
    山西省有农学院和几个农业学校，每年都出来几百个毕业生。但是，大部分毕业生都被分配到省农业厅等上级机关去了。我希望能从上级机关多抽些技术人员，充实下面的技术推广站。　雷国文
