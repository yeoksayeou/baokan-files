Following an in-depth investigation and understanding of the needs of agricultural cooperatives, the Xinxiang Special District of Henan Province is actively arranging the production of small farm tools.

(Our Dispatch) The Handicraft Management Office of the Xinxiang Special Administrative Office in Henan, along with handicraft cooperatives in various counties, are actively arranging the production of small farm tools to support the spring plowing.

To clearly understand the demand for agricultural tools during the spring agricultural production season, the Handicraft Management Office of the Xinxiang Special Administrative Office and handicraft cooperatives in various counties organized teams to conduct in-depth investigations and visits to rural areas. They also signed farm tool supply contracts with some agricultural cooperatives. According to investigations in Yanjin and Fengqiu counties, on average, each laborer has less than half a hoe, a little more than half a sickle, and approximately one iron shovel for every ten laborers. To meet the needs of spring plowing, an additional 61% of farm tools are required. According to surveys in Yuanyang, Yanjin, and Wen counties, among 274 agricultural cooperatives, only 15 could resolve their farm tool needs independently. 119 cooperatives needed to purchase a portion or the majority of their farm tools, and 140 cooperatives relied entirely on handicraft cooperatives for their supply.

To arrange for the production of small farm tools as early as possible to avoid delaying agricultural activities, most counties in the region have formulated plans to serve spring agricultural production. Five counties including Jiyuan plan to supply more than 500,000 pieces of various small farm tools during the spring plowing season. Seven counties, including Meng, Bo'ai, and Yanjin, have already signed contracts with agricultural cooperatives for the production of 65,000 farm tools. After sending personnel to visit agricultural cooperatives, the Jixian Handicraft Cooperative plans to process 4,700 hoes, 20,000 sickles, 2,500铡knives, and 150,000 other small farm tools in the first half of this year. To effectively carry out farm tool production and repair work, each county convened meetings of basic-level cooperative directors in late January to summarize the experiences and lessons learned from small farm tool production last year. The special district's supply and marketing station has specially prepared more than 2 million catties of steel for the production of small farm tools throughout the district, and basic-level cooperatives are also vigorously purchasing scrap iron. Qinyang, Meng, Jiyuan, and other counties have solved many production difficulties by using pig iron to forge wrought iron. The supply of coal, under the unified balance and distribution of the state, has also been initially resolved. At present, the region's reserve of iron and steel basically guarantees the supply of materials for production in the first half of the year.

To effectively improve farm tool repair work and provide convenience to farmers, various handicraft cooperatives will establish and improve repair stations and points, and organize temporary mobile repair teams to go from village to village and cooperative to cooperative.

    经过深入调查了解了农业社的需要
    河南新乡专区积极安排小农具生产
    本报讯　河南新乡专署手工业管理处和各县手工业社，积极安排小件农具生产，支援春耕。
    为了清楚地了解春季农业生产需要农具的情况，新乡专署手工业管理处和各县手工业社，曾先后组织力量，深入农村进行调查访问，并与部分农业社签订了农具供应合同。据延津、封丘两县调查，每个劳动力平均合不到半张锄，镰刀每个劳动力平均合半张多一点，差不多每十个劳动力才合一张铁锨，春耕中需要再增加61％的农具才够用。据原阳、延津、温县调查，在二百七十四个农业社中，自己可以解决农具困难的只有十五个社，需要购买一部分或大部分农具的有一百一十九个社，全部需要手工业社供应的一百四十个社。
    为了及早安排小件农具生产，不误农时，目前全区大部分县制定了为春耕生产服务的计划。济源等五县春耕中计划供应各种小件农具五十多万件；孟县、博爱、延津等七个县，已与农业社签订了生产六万五千件农具的合同。汲县手工业社派人深入农业社访问后，今年上半年计划加工锄头四千七百张、镰刀两万张，铡刀二千五百张，其它各种小件农具十五万件。为了切实做好农具生产与修配工作，各县均在1月下旬先后召开了基层社主任会议，总结去年小件农具生产的经验教训。专区供销站专门为全区生产小件农具，准备钢铁二百余万斤，各基层社也大力收购废铁。沁阳、孟县、济源等用生铁锻熟铁的办法，解决了生产中的不少困难。煤炭供应在国家统一平衡分配下，也初步得到了解决。目前全区储备的钢铁，基本上保证了上半年生产的材料供应。
    为了切实搞好农具修配工作，便利农民，各手工业社将建立健全修配站、点，组织临时流动修配组串乡、串社。
