    Nostalgia for the "Drama Troupe"
    Qi Dongye
    The bloating and complexity of institutions are not unique to administrative departments; some drama groups are also gradually contracting this disease, and it tends to be quite serious. In some groups, non-productive administrative personnel account for nearly a third of the staff. There are departments, offices, and sections. While they may not yet dare to be fully "enterprised," the framework of a government office has been largely established. I heard a friend who had visited some foreign countries say that the number of administrative personnel in some brother countries' theaters is so small that, according to our current practice, it seems impossible to work at all. However, they still work very well, performances at the theater have not been interrupted, and they don't feel too inconvenienced.
    Reflecting on the present and recalling the past, I am quite nostalgic for the drama troupes of the old days.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Anti-Enemy Drama Troupes, which galloped across the north and south of the Yangtze River, had only a few dozen people. This included directors, actors, stage crew, and administrative personnel. They traveled dozens of miles a day, set up stages, performed plays, dismantled stages, transported scenery, sang, and danced, and did a great deal of inspiring work. Some may think this was a guerrilla style, forced by the environment. But they were not just good at guerrilla warfare; they could also fight positional warfare. These same people, in the period before the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the liberation, entered the cities, upheld the banner of progress, and performed many Chinese and foreign plays of high artistic and ideological quality in theaters. Some of these performances were no less impressive than those of today. They used the fewest people to do the most things, and the least amount of money to achieve the greatest effect. They knew how to use one person as two, and spend one penny as two. Under the premise of being as economical as possible, they completed artistic creations of a very high standard, without any habit of arbitrary squandering, nor any crudely produced products. There were no idlers, no backlogs, and they also maintained living and performance expenses. In today's terms, they met the requirements of "enterprise."
    Of course, today the situation has changed, and the conditions are many times better. The point I am making is not to ask today's actors to still move scenery and manage lighting (although if necessary, there is nothing wrong with that). However, shouldn't that spirit of careful calculation and striving for frugality still be retained and promoted? If the people in charge could do things themselves, could they reduce the manpower required for concrete work? If those working in stage art could use their brains more, could they come up with many substitute items that are cheaper than the real thing? If the director could grasp the directing plan more accurately, could they spend less time? Furthermore, if some light cavalry teams, like the drama troupes, could be produced again today, capable of mobile performances and of high quality, would there not be more opportunities to reach the audience, and would the breadth of the masses' appreciation of artistic works not be greater?
    I have not the slightest intention of opposing the establishment of theatrical art. However, the establishment of theatrical art should not contradict the principles of streamlining and economy. Especially at present, it would be beneficial to emphasize this issue. The most touching thing on the stage is truth. Achieving this effect requires in-depth life experience and superb artistic cultivation. The army values quality over quantity. Setting up a large organizational structure, and spending several thousand yuan on costumes for a single play, actually has little to do with truth. On the contrary, it creates some superficial and gorgeous effects, which sometimes obscure the truth and dilute the effort to explore it.
    Do not despise minor details. Many a little makes a mickle. Those who participated in the drama troupes are now scattered in large theaters across the country. Soliciting their opinions and summarizing their experiences will be beneficial to both running theaters thriftily and achieving the "enterprising" of theaters more quickly.

    怀念“演剧队”
    齐东野
    机构臃肿庞杂，不独行政部门如是，有些演剧团体也渐染此病，且有颇为严重之势。有的团体，非生产性的行政人员几占三分之一，有处、室、科之设，企业化虽未敢必，而机关的架子却已大致搭起了。曾听到一位到过国外的朋友谈起，有些兄弟国家的剧院，行政人员少到依我们目前的惯例看来，似乎无法工作的地步，而他们却依然工作得很好，剧场上演迄未中辍，也没有太感到不方便。
    抚今追昔，使我颇为怀思当年的演剧队。
    抗战时期，驰骋在大江南北的抗敌演剧队，人手不过几十，导演、演员、舞台工作、行政人员都包括在其中了。日行数十里，搭台演戏，拆台运景，载歌载舞，做出了许许多多感奋人心的工作。也许有人会认为这是游击作风，环境使然，不得不尔。但他们并不是只会打游击战不会打阵地战的。也还是这些人，在抗战胜利解放之前这段时期内，进入了城市，坚持着进步的旗帜，在剧场演出了许许多多艺术性思想性都很不低的中外名剧。有些演出比之今日也无逊色。他们用最少的人办最多的事，用最少的钱求最大的效果，懂得一人当做二人用，一钱当作两钱花，在尽可能节约的情况下，完成了水平很不低的艺术创作，没有任意挥霍的脾气，可也没有粗制滥造的成品。没有闲人，也没有积压，而且还维持住了生活、演出费用，用今天的话来说，是达到了企业化的要求。
    当然，今天情况变了，条件好到不知有多少倍。我提这些话的意思，也并不是要求今天的演员仍去搬布景，管灯光（虽然假如需要也没什么不可以）。然而，那种精打细算力求节俭的作风，不是依然可以保留而且发扬的吗？做主管的人，如果能遇事躬亲的话，是不是就可以减少些做具体工作的人力呢？做舞台美术工作的人，如果多开动开动脑筋，是不是就可以想出许多比实物更便宜的代用物品呢？做导演的如果把导演计划掌握得准确一些，是否就可以少耗费一些时间呢？甚而至于，如果今天再产生一些能够流动演出而质量并不低的，如演剧队那样的轻骑队，是不是接触观众的机会就会更多，群众欣赏艺术作品的广度也就会更大一些呢？
    我没有一丝反对建立剧场艺术的企图，然而，建立剧场艺术与精简节约的原则不应背谬，特别在目前，强调地提一提这问题，是会有好处的。舞台上最感人的东西是真实，达到这样的效果需要的是深入的生活体验和精湛的艺术修养，兵贵精不贵多，摆下一座大的机关架子，一出戏的服装就花上几千元，其实和真实的关系倒并不大的，相反地，是造成一些浮面的华丽效果，有时却往往会遮掩了真实，和冲淡了对于探索真实的努力。
    不要轻视细微末节，集腋便可成裘，参加过演剧队的人几乎散在全国的大剧院中，征求征求他们的意见，总结总结他们的经验，无论对勤俭办剧院，或是如何更快地达到剧院的企业化，都是会有好处的。
