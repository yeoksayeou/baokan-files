    Let Everyone Play a Positive Role in New Positions
    Anhui Finance and Trade System Arranges Transferred Personnel
    Wuhan Municipal People's Committee Abolishes Seven Offices
    (Based on a report from this newspaper) The finance and trade system in Anhui Province is actively preparing to arrange positions for transferred personnel. Initial plans for the Anhui Province finance and trade system involve cutting 4,904 organizations and reducing the number of employees by 34,938. These personnel will be properly resettled. According to local needs for developing production, the Commerce Department plans to establish three frozen food processing plants, a freshwater clam button processing plant, and a pressed duck processing plant. The Grain Department plans to establish small sesame oil mills, feed processing plants, and breeding farms. The supply and marketing cooperative plans to establish waste product processing plants, charcoal burning plants, etc. Various departments within the finance and trade system also plan to establish several larger-scale agricultural, forestry, and livestock farms. Currently, the sites for some of the agricultural, forestry, and livestock farms have been surveyed and production is being planned. Some of the mechanical equipment needed for some factories has been partially prepared, and personnel have been sent to other places to learn technology.
    More than 11,000 transferred personnel will engage in various production activities in the aforementioned factories and agricultural, forestry, and livestock farms. More than 4,000 people will go to strengthen the leadership of free markets and grain markets. A portion of the personnel will be transferred to establish state-owned commercial secondary wholesale stations. These transferred personnel engaged in various jobs will still receive their original grade and salary, in order to encourage them to actively produce and increase more wealth for the country.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 26th: The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee has abolished its affiliated offices on various fronts based on the current work situation. This measure streamlines the structure and enables leading cadres to delve deeper into reality.
    In early 1955, the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee established eight offices to adapt to the then-high tide of socialist transformation. During this reorganization, after repeated investigation and research, it was found that some of these agencies were no longer adapted to the current new situation and were hindering leading cadres from engaging with reality. Therefore, the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee decided that, in addition to merging the Office for the Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, all other seven offices would be abolished. After the abolition, seven groups will be set up to manage the relevant business of each front separately, to assist the relevant vice mayors and secretary-general in their daily work. In this way, the relevant vice mayors will have more opportunities to go deep into the grassroots level, engage with the reality of the work, and personally deal with problems in practical work. The problems of the relevant bureaus can also be directly reflected to the People's Committee through the relevant vice mayors or secretary-general and be resolved in a timely manner. This can avoid the drawbacks of the past, such as multiple layers, slow communication up and down, and inefficient handling of affairs.
    After these seven offices were abolished and seven groups were established, the number of cadres was reduced from more than 170 to 43. The surplus cadres will be transferred to new agencies or demoted to work at the grassroots level.

    让每个人都在新的岗位上发挥积极作用
    安徽财贸系统安排被抽调人员
    武汉市人民委员会撤消七个办公室
    本报讯　安徽省财贸系统正积极准备安排被抽调的人员。安徽省财贸系统初步计划可减去四千九百零四个机构，减少职工三万四千九百三十八人。这些人员，将分别得到妥善安置。根据当地发展生产的需要，商业厅计划建立三个冷冻加工厂、一个蚌壳钮扣加工厂和板鸭加工厂，粮食厅计划建立小磨麻油厂、饲料加工厂和饲养场，供销社准备建立废品加工厂、烧木炭厂等。财贸系统各部门还计划建立几个规模较大的农林牧场。现在，有的农林牧场场址已勘察就绪，筹划生产。有的工厂所需的机械设备部分已准备好，并派出人员到外地学习技术。
    被抽调的人员将有一万一千多人到上述工厂和农林牧场中从事各种生产活动，四千多人将去加强自由市场和粮食市场的领导，还有一部分人将调出建立国营商业二级批发站。这些从事各种工作的被抽调的人员，仍将按原级原薪待遇，以鼓励他们积极生产，为国家增加更多财富。
    新华社武汉26日电　武汉市人民委员会根据目前的工作情况，撤消了所属各战线办公室。这一措施既精简了机构，又能使领导干部深入实际。
    武汉市人民委员会在1955年初为了适应当时的社会主义改造高潮成立了八个办公室。在这次整编时，经过反复调查研究，发现这些机构有的已不能适应目前的新情况，并且还对领导干部的接触实际有妨碍。因此，武汉市人民委员会决定除把对资本主义改造办公室与工商局合署办公外，其他七个办公室全部撤消，在撤消后另设七个组分别管理各个战线的有关业务，以协助各主管市长和秘书长进行日常工作。这样，各主管市长就有更多的机会深入基层，接触工作实际，亲自处理实际工作中的问题；而各有关局的问题也能通过主管市长或秘书长直接反映到人民委员会去得到及时解决，从而可以避免过去层次重叠所造成的行文多、上下通气迟缓、办事不灵便等弊病。
    这七个办公室撤消另外设立七个组后，干部就由原来的一百七十多人减少到四十三人。编余干部将调到新的机构或下调到基层单位去工作。
