Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 11th: The Third Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways Design Bureau adopted 769 suggestions from Soviet experts in the survey and design work for newly built and reconstructed railways last year, saving the state over 11.3 million yuan in investment.

Last year, the staff of this design institute, together with eighteen Soviet experts, conducted surveys and designs for ten newly built and reconstructed railways and eight large hub stations in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Soviet experts were meticulous in their calculations in their work. In order to help Chinese railway builders find an economically reasonable route, they often went deep into barren mountains and fields, working day and night to conduct surveys. Line experts Kamolov and others, in order to find a route connecting the Beijing-Hankou and Nantongpu railways, went deep into the Taihang Mountains three times, working for nearly five months. After careful surveying by the Soviet experts and repeated research with Chinese technicians, they proposed many improvement plans. The final determined route was not only shorter than the original plan and the roadbed more solid, but also reduced some tunnel and bridge projects, saving more than 3.5 million yuan in investment.

Soviet experts not only provided specific assistance to Chinese technicians through on-site practical work and joint research, but also tried their best to allow Chinese technicians to think independently and boldly propose work plans. Last year, the experts took the time to compile more than 30 kinds of lecture notes for Chinese technicians and gave more than 20 technical and experience reports. With the help of the experts, many young technicians have been able to independently undertake the overall design of new lines. Zhu Kun, who graduated from Jiaotong University in 1952, has now become the chief engineer of the railway survey and design department of this design institute under the training of Soviet experts.

The selfless working enthusiasm of the Soviet experts deeply moved every Chinese technician who worked with them. Xieerbakov, the leader of the Soviet expert team, who is nearly sixty years old, traveled back and forth in a desert area of more than forty kilometers to study whether the railway from Baotou to Yinchuan could cross the Yellow River less often and build one less bridge, inspecting the terrain. When the car was stuck in the sand, they pushed it; sometimes they had to ride camels and walk, enduring the wind and sand and hunger and thirst, and persevered in their work. When geologist Hulus was inspecting the roadbed geology from Zhan Dian to Dongguan, he ignored his arthritis and climbed high mountains and drilled into thorn-filled bushes to observe rock fissures, and waded across the river more than ten times to explore the foundation for bridge construction. They lived in tents with Chinese workers in the field, and during their spare time, they joined in festivities with local residents, with the same kinship and friendship as brothers.

    在我国北方新建改建铁路的勘测设计中
    苏联专家提出七百多项建议
    新华社天津11日电　铁道部设计总局第三设计院在去年进行新建和改建铁路的勘测设计工作中，采纳了苏联专家的七百六十九项建议，为国家节省投资一千一百三十多万元。
    去年，这个设计院的工作人员同十八位苏联专家一起，在河北、河南、山东、山西、辽宁五省和内蒙古自治区等地，为新建和改建的十条铁路和八座大枢纽站作了勘测、设计。
    苏联专家在工作中处处精打细算。他们为了帮助中国的铁路建设者寻找一条经济合理的线路，往往深入荒山野地，夜以继日地进行勘测。线路专家卡莫洛夫等，为了寻找一条连接京汉和南同蒲两条铁路的线路，曾经三次深入到太行山区，工作了近五个月；经过苏联专家们的仔细勘测及同中国技术人员的反复研究，提出许多改进方案，最后确定的线路，不但长度比原计划缩短、路基更加坚固，同时还减少了一些隧道和桥梁工程，节省投资三百五十多万元。
    苏联专家不仅通过现场的实际工作和共同研究，对中国技术人员进行具体帮助，并且尽量让中国技术人员独立思考，充分地、大胆地提出工作方案。专家们在去年抽出时间替中国技术人员编写了三十多种讲义，作了二十多次技术和经验报告。许多青年技术人员在专家们的帮助下，已经能够独立地担负新线路的总体设计工作。1952年才从交通大学毕业的朱坤，在苏联专家的培养下，现在已经成为这个设计院铁路勘测设计处的主任工程师。
    苏联专家们忘我的工作热情，使每一个同他们一起工作的中国技术人员深受感动。年近六十岁的苏联专家组组长谢尔巴可夫，为了研究包头到银川的铁路是不是可以少过一次黄河、少建一座大桥，曾经在一段长达四十多公里的沙漠地带往返奔波着察看地形。汽车被沙子陷住了，就推着它；有时还要骑骆驼和步行，忍受着风沙的扑打和饥渴，坚持工作。地质专家赫鲁斯在检查詹店到东观的路基地质时，不顾患有关节炎的疾病，登上高山，钻进生满荆棘的灌木丛里去观察岩石裂纹，并且有十多次涉水过河去探索建桥的基础。他们在野外同中国工人一起住帐篷，业余的时候同当地居民一起联欢，像兄弟一样的亲切和友爱。
