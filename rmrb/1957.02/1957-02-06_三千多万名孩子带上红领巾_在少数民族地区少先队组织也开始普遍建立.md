Xinhua News Agency, February 5th. Over 30 million children across the country now wear red scarves and have become members of the Young Pioneers.

1956 was a year of great development for Young Pioneer organizations throughout the country, with over 10 million children joining during the year. In over a dozen provinces, including Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Shanxi, the number of Young Pioneers exceeds one million. Shandong Province now has 3.55 million members, with over 1.2 million children joining since last year. The number of Young Pioneers in Sichuan Province also exceeds three million. Currently, Young Pioneer organizations have generally been established in junior high schools and elementary schools in cities, as well as complete elementary schools and central elementary schools in rural areas. Young Pioneer organizations are also being established successively in primary elementary schools in the vast rural areas. In Shuyang County, Jiangsu, Young Pioneer organizations have now been established in all rural primary elementary schools with two or more classes. In minority areas, Young Pioneer organizations are also beginning to be universally established. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region already has over 100,000 Young Pioneers. Last year, over 600 children in Lhasa and Shigatse in Tibet wore red scarves.

While Young Pioneer organizations in schools have developed extensively, out-of-school Young Pioneer organizations have also grown. Shandong Province and Sichuan Province each have over 600,000 out-of-school Young Pioneers.
