Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 7th: According to TASS, the 32nd Congress of the Italian Socialist Party opened in Venice on the 6th. The question of merging the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party is on the agenda of the congress.

Guests attending the congress included British Labour Party leaders Aneurin Bevan and Morgan Phillips, and Acting General Secretary of the French Socialist Party, Pierre Commin, among others.

Giancarlo Pajetta, member of the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the Italian Communist Party. He emphasized that for more than twenty years, the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party have been acting in brotherly unity. This has enabled the two parties to achieve great successes, strengthen their ranks, and also enable the working class to establish firm ties with a large number of middle strata. The unity of action between Communists and Socialists is a victorious achievement of the Italian working people.

Speaking on the issue of the merger of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party, Pajetta stated that the Italian Communists have always advocated expanding the domestic camp for democracy and progress. However, to expand and strengthen this camp, the forces that should merge are those with the same goals.

Matteotti, Secretary of the Italian Social Democratic Party, stated in his address that the two parties should merge based on the platform of the Social Democratic Party, and demanded that the Socialist Party support the so-called "Western unity" policy.

(Note) As early as 1934, the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party concluded a "Unified Action Pact" on the basis of unity and joint opposition to fascism. After the end of the Second World War, the two parties revised the "Unified Action Pact" in October 1946 and formulated a "Unified Action Program." The right-wing elements in the Socialist Party have always wanted to split the unity between the workers' class parties. In January 1947, a faction headed by Saragat withdrew from the Socialist Party and organized the Workers' Socialist Party. In May 1949, a faction headed by Romita also separately formed the Unified Socialist Party. In April 1951, the Workers' Socialist Party and the Unified Socialist Party merged to form the Social Democratic Party. After the local elections held in Italy in May 1956, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party had to consider the relationship with the Socialist Party, and the two parties began to brew a merger. However, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party attempted to use the Socialists' desire for a merger to split the cooperative relationship between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

    意大利社会党举行代表大会
    讨论同社会民主党合并问题
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社威尼斯讯：意大利社会党第三十二次代表大会6日在威尼斯开幕。列在代表大会议程上的是关于社会党和社会民主党合并的问题。
    列席这次代表大会的来宾有英国工党领袖安奈林·比万和摩根·菲利普斯、法国社会党代理总书记比埃尔·戈曼等人。
    意大利共产党指导部委员贾恩卡洛·巴叶塔代表意大利共产党向代表大会致贺词。他强调指出，二十多年以来，意大利共产党和意大利社会党一直是兄弟般地一致行动的。这使两党取得了巨大的成就，加强了自己的队伍，也使工人阶级同为数很大的中等阶层建立了牢固的联系。共产党人和社会党人的行动一致是意大利劳动人民的胜利成果。
    巴叶塔在谈到社会党同社会民主党合并的问题的时候表示：意大利共产党人始终主张扩大国内争取民主和进步的阵营。但是，要扩大和加强这个阵营，合并的应当是抱有同一目的的力量。
    意大利社会民主党书记马特奥蒂在致词中主张两党根据社会民主党的纲领进行合并，要求社会党支持所谓“西方团结”的政策。
      （注）早在1934年，意大利共产党和社会党就在团结一致、共同反对法西斯的斗争的基础上缔结了一项“统一行动公约”。第二次世界大战结束后，两党又在1946年10月修订了“统一行动公约”，订立了“统一行动纲领”。社会党中的右翼分子一直想分裂工人阶级政党之间的团结。1947年1月，以萨拉盖特为首的一派退出社会党，组织工人社会党。1949年5月，以罗米塔为首的一派也另行组成统一社会党。1951年4月，工人社会党和统一社会党合并，组成了社会民主党。1956年5月意大利举行地方选举后，社会民主党的领袖们不得不考虑同社会党的关系问题，两党开始酝酿合并。但社会民主党的领袖们企图利用社会党人争取合并的意愿来分裂社会党和共产党之间的合作关系。
