    Beach Mangrove Forest

    On the beaches of Haicheng, Longxi, and Tong'an counties in Fujian, there grow dense "Beach Mangrove Forests." These forests play a role in protecting dikes, preventing wind, and preventing waves, protecting coastal farmland from seawater and strong winds. The left picture is of the red mangrove tree, one of the tree species in the mangrove forest. It blooms twice a year and bears fruit twice. It is a "viviparous tree," with the fruit germinating on the mother tree and growing into seedlings. This tree is full of seedlings that are already five or six inches long. After the seedlings mature, the wind blows the tree, the seedlings fall out of the fruit, insert themselves into the sea mud to grow, or float on the water surface to reproduce elsewhere. The right picture is of the Kandelia candel, one of the tree species in the mangrove forest. Photo by Jiang Shunxing

    海滩红树森林
    在福建海澄、龙溪、同安等县的海滩上，长着茂密的“海滩红树森林”。这些森林起着护堤、防风、防浪等作用，保护沿海农田不受海水和大风的侵害。左图是红树森林树种之一的红海榄树。它每年开花两次，结实两次。它是一种“胎生树”，果实在母树上发芽长成幼苗。这棵树上满挂着已经有五、六寸长的幼苗。成苗后，风吹树动，幼苗脱出果实，插在海泥里成长，或浮在水面漂到别处繁殖。右图是红树森林树种之一的木榄树。　姜顺兴摄
