Shenyang Electric News: The workers of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory are further tapping the potential for saving precious metals by rationally improving product structure, reducing product weight, and using substitutes based on the original foundation. Last year alone, this factory saved 282 tons of precious metals through improved technology and materials management, and the metal utilization rate exceeded the original design standard by 5%. In order to solve the difficulty of steel shortage, the factory leadership organized engineering and technical personnel to study more than 600 kinds of parts in the products, reviewed the material quality and mechanical performance of the products, and widely referred to foreign materials, and proposed a total of 13 substitution material saving plans. Their work has received enthusiastic support and assistance from the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Benxi Iron and Steel Plant, and mine users.

Currently, according to the substitute material plan, the factory has successfully tested 56 kinds of parts in 11 kinds of products, including heavy-duty, medium-sized, and retractable rock drills, which can be produced using carbon steel and ductile iron instead of the previous chromium steel and nickel-chromium steel. For example, the rotating grid bar barrel sleeve of the OM506 rock drill, which used to be produced with expensive chromium steel, is now produced with low-carbon steel, which can save 14,000 yuan annually. In order to ensure the service life of the product, the factory carefully sent it to the mine for industrial trials by the miners, and sent people there to observe the product's load operation and usage records. After trial use in the mine, it was proved that the service life of the spiral rod nut, a consumable part of the rock drill, has been increased from the original 120 hours to 160 hours after the carbon steel was changed to ductile iron.

Most of the factory's products are designed according to Soviet drawings, and the technology and quotas are generally advanced, but because the product design time is now five or six years ago, and some regulations do not fully meet China's actual situation, the factory recently conducted a review analysis and modification of the structure and material consumption quotas of 18 old products. For example, the quota for the 01-30 rock drill used to be 99 kilograms, but it has been reduced to 92 kilograms after modification. By compressing the machining allowance of 250 kinds of parts, the 01-30 rock drill alone can save 37 tons of steel annually.

### 合理改进产品结构　设法利用代用材料  沈阳风动工具厂节约贵重金属二百八十二吨

    合理改进产品结构　设法利用代用材料
    沈阳风动工具厂节约贵重金属二百八十二吨
    本报沈阳电　沈阳风动工具厂职工在原有基础上进一步从合理改进产品结构、减轻产品体重和采用代用品等方面挖掘贵重金属的潜力。去年一年这个工厂从改进技术和材料管理上节约了二百八十二吨贵重金属，并使金属利用率超过原有设计标准的5％。为了解决钢材不足的困难，今年工厂领导方面组织了工程技术人员研究了产品中的六百多种部件，审查了产品的材质、机械效能，广泛地参考了国外资料，共提出了十三项代用材料的节约计划。他们的工作受到中国科学院金属研究所、本溪鞍钢钢厂和矿山用户的热情支持和援助。
    目前，这个工厂根据代用材料计划试验成功的共有重型、中型、伸缩性凿岩机等十一种产品五十六种部件可以采用炭素钢、球墨铸铁代替过去的铬钢和镍铬钢生产。仅OM506型凿岩机的转动格条筒套，由贵重的铬钢改用低炭钢生产，全年就可节约一万四千元。工厂为了保证产品的使用寿命，十分慎重地把它送到矿山让矿工们进行工业试验，并派人到那里观察产品负荷运转情况和使用记录。经矿山试用证明：凿岩机的消耗零件螺旋棒螺母由炭素钢改为球墨铸铁以后，它的使用寿命已由原有的一百二十小时提高到了一百六十小时。
    这个工厂产品大部分是按苏联图纸设计的，工艺和定额一般都较先进，但由于产品设计时间距现在已有五、六年，并且有些规定不完全符合我国实际，因此，工厂最近对十八种旧产品的结构、材料消耗定额进行了复查分析和修改。如01—30凿岩机过去定额是九十九公斤，修改后降低到九十二公斤。在二百五十种部件压缩加工余量中仅01—30凿岩机全年就可节约三十七吨钢材。
