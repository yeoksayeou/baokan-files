We Must Carry Forward the Excellent Traditions of Chinese Dance Art
Ouyang Yuqian

Some people think that China has no dance art. We must loudly tell these people that China had extremely excellent and abundant dance art more than a thousand years ago. Our dance art has a long and excellent tradition that cannot be ignored.

Dance originates from labor. To give a recent example: the "Zhuo" of Tibetan dance developed from the action of building walls. The Yao ethnic group's "Long Drum Dance" depicts the actions of building houses or making long drums. Our primitive dances involved holding cow tails or bird feathers, representing hunting. The ancient character for "dance" depicts a person holding cow tails in both hands while dancing. Ancient dances to worship gods were also combined with labor. Gods were an imagination of people in their struggle with nature. Dances to worship gods were either to pray for good harvests or to ward off disasters. Nuo dances were for driving away evil spirits. Ancient witches were experts who used dance to worship gods.

In ancient times, there were quite a few recorded names for dances. They mainly described hunting and battles, as well as sacrificial rituals. There were also dances of love between men and women. All of these were directly related to people's lives.

During our Zhou Dynasty (7th century BC), music and dance were very developed due to economic and cultural development. In terms of dance, primitive dance forms were organized into very orderly formations (such as the Great Wu and the Eight Rows Dance), and its content was more complex than before. Moreover, at that time, learning dance was prescribed as a system for noble children. For example, "Thirteen dance the Shao, adults dance the Xiang." Dance was also very developed among the people. For example, the "Chen Feng" in the Book of Songs describes the frenzy of men and women dancing joyfully.

The Han Dynasty had a major characteristic: due to national unification, the economy, culture, and military force were relatively developed. At that time, the national power was strong, and traffic with the Western Regions opened up roads. Various acrobatic performances from home and abroad gathered in the Western Capital. Acrobatic performances were mainly acrobatics, but there were also dances among them. There might be some programs where dance and acrobatics were intertwined and difficult to distinguish; there were also things that performed story fragments, like the Yellow Duke of the Eastern Sea. I think acrobatic performances played a great role in stimulating the development of dance and promoting dance art. For example, the most popular "Seven Plate Dance" at that time, according to existing rubbings and records, may have initially been a type of acrobatic performance; later, through continuous processing, it became dance art. According to Fu Yi's "Dance Ode" of the Later Han Dynasty, this dance was very wonderful.

During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Western Region music and dance were imported in large quantities, and Indian music and dance also came in with Buddhism, becoming extremely popular (the introduction of Western Region music and dance and Buddhist music into China did not start from the Northern and Southern Dynasties). Western Region music and dance were popular in the Northern Dynasties, while Qing Shang music was popular in the Southern Dynasties, the so-called "Jiangnan Wu songs, Jingchu four tones." Dances included Gong Mo, Bai Zhu, and Bai Jiu dances. Dance techniques such as Da Chuishou and Xiao Chuishou were already mentioned in Emperor Jianwen of Liang's poems and continued to be used until the Tang and Song dynasties.

The Sui Dynasty unified China, and gathered the music and dance of the Southern and Northern Dynasties, foreign countries, China, the court, and the folk into the Nine Divisions Music. In the court, there were large-scale music, dance, and acrobatic organizations. There were also some dance creations among the people.

Emperor Taizong Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty unified China, and the national power was prosperous, and the territory expanded. During the prosperous Tang Dynasty, life was relatively stable for nearly a hundred years, and the economy and culture developed rapidly. In terms of music and dance, it inherited the old system of the Nine Divisions Music of the Sui Dynasty, and continuously developed it. At this time, music and dance can be said to be a collection of the great achievements of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. It was the most important period in the history of Chinese music and dance. In terms of dance alone, it also had brilliant achievements.

In a short space, it is impossible to give a relatively systematic explanation of Tang Dynasty dance. I would like to talk about a few characteristics:

The characteristics of Tang Dynasty music and dance, it goes without saying, the scale was grand. At that time, acrobatics and dance were clearly separated, and dance became an independent art; both technique and artistry were strengthened. Second, various dances from foreign countries, border regions, ethnic minorities, and the folk were concentrated in Chang'an, and were not only frequently performed in the court and among the literati, but also widely circulated among the people, enriching the dance art of the time. Third, foreign dance art, after a long period of brewing, underwent great changes in the Tang Dynasty. Some dances, after processing, changed their content and form. Some dances combined with the original Han dances or other ethnic dances, and became new things. Of course, this change was not as fast as it is today, but rather slow. Fourth, various dance arts and some techniques in acrobatics were integrated by artists, resulting in new creations. Fifth, new dances were created based on new music; Sixth, dance and poetry were better combined than in the past, resulting in new forms.

The scale of song and dance in the Song Dynasty was not as large as in the Tang Dynasty, but dance art still had new developments; there were more than twenty kinds of team dances in the Song Dynasty that can be named, and the dance music and costumes were mostly inherited from the Tang Dynasty.

Chinese music and dance have been influenced by foreign countries since the Han Dynasty, especially in the Tang Dynasty, when a large number of Western Region music and dances were imported. We not only received their influence, but also absorbed a lot of things, enriching our dance art and developing dance creation. However, absorbing foreign things was not blind and without choice. Some foreign dances, when they first came in, caused a sensation for a while, but over time, they were not very popular and did not spread widely. For example, "Splashing Cold Hu Play" (many people riding on horseback, carrying water-filled pockets on their backs, splashing people under the horse) once aroused everyone's curiosity, but later only the song "Su Mu Zhe" used was left, and the "Huo Tuo Dance," which changed its appearance. Both the Hu Xuan and Hu Teng dances had entered the court and circulated among the people, but they were not absorbed and promoted. Perhaps people at that time were not very accustomed to that kind of dancing high and turning fast. Looking at the Dunhuang Tang Dynasty murals, the dancing girls of the musicians are barefoot and bare-chested, wearing wind belts. This is obviously a depiction of fairies based on Indian life. However, whether from written records or paintings, sculptures, and unearthed clay figurines, our dancing girls have never been without clothes or shoes and socks. Like the Zhe Zhi Dance, it was originally danced by one person, but later it was added to two people, called Double Zhe Zhi; by the Song Dynasty, it was danced by five people, and the person in the middle was called "Hua Xin"; later it developed to twenty-four people. In terms of music, this dance was combined with Da Qu, and in terms of dance organization, bamboo poles were added to recite words, Hua Xin recited lyrics and sang, and there was also chorus; some content was also changed, becoming Lotus Dance or Lotus Terrace Dance, and there were also performances of lotus picking. In terms of clothing, it was originally narrow sleeves, silver belts, and pointed hats with curled brims, with bells on top. Later, it was changed, and the pointed hat was replaced with a phoenix crown. Dances like this completely became Chinese things, and their expression forms were completely combined with Chinese customs and habits. It can be seen that at that time, foreign art was absorbed if needed, and gradually digested to become one's own thing; if it was considered unsuitable, it was taken or discarded according to the tendency of the majority of people. Changes were of course slow and took a relatively long time.

Another characteristic is that Chinese dance art, like Chinese music, was jointly created by people of all ethnic groups and is the common wealth of our national family.

Chinese dance art has not only absorbed many good things from abroad to enrich itself and develop creation; in the Tang and Song dynasties, it had a great influence on Korea and Japan: many of the music and dances of the Tang and Song dynasties were spread to Japan, and most of them are still preserved, such as: "Lan Ling Wang," "Chun Ying Zhuan," "Hu Yin Jiu," "Po Zhen Yue," and so on. Japanese museums also have masks passed down from the Tang Dynasty. Korean music had already been introduced to China more than a thousand years ago, and the Goryeo Division was in the Nine Divisions Music of the Sui Dynasty; later, music and dances from the Tang and Song dynasties were introduced to Korea in large quantities. The book "Music Learning Norms" was sent to Korea by the Ming Dynasty, and the music and dances recorded in it were all Chinese. After arriving in Korea, it was combined with Korean dance and changed to some extent, becoming Korean art and forming a unique style.

The music and dance of the Tang Dynasty were much worse after the An Lushan Rebellion. The scale of dance in the Song Dynasty was not as large as in the Tang Dynasty, and the rulers of the Yuan and Ming dynasties had no knowledge of music and dance and were not interested in it. In addition, influenced by the Cheng-Zhu school of Neo-Confucianism in the Song Dynasty, emphasis was placed on "do not look at what is contrary to propriety, do not listen to what is contrary to propriety," and also "do not speak of what is contrary to propriety." Feudal rulers used Neo-Confucianism to govern the world, and tried their best to shackle the thoughts and behaviors of young people, regarding folk music and dance as "licentious music." Men had to "do not look at what is contrary to propriety, do not listen to what is contrary to propriety," and women could only wrap their little feet and be deeply closed in their boudoirs. Not to mention dancing, even going to the gate to see the street would be discussed.

As for folk music and dance, they have been restricted by the rulers since ancient times, and have often been banned. One is because they are said to hinder agricultural affairs, and another is because they are said to affect customs, and another is that the entertainment products of the upper class are not allowed to be occupied by the people: There are provisions prohibiting folk entertainment in the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Chinese music and dance, especially dance, gradually declined after the Song Dynasty, and almost all of the original things were lost, and many are no longer traceable. In addition to the above reasons, another is that time art is difficult to preserve. In the past, in addition to writing, there were no tools to preserve these things. Especially after the war, one looting, one burning, and one killing wiped out the accumulated artistic wealth, so that those of us who study dance history today and want to inherit the national cultural heritage cannot but look for traces from broken tiles, remaining murals, clay figurines, and sporadic written records. But despite this, our data is still exceptionally rich, and thousands of years of cultural history have accumulated huge wealth for us. Even if what remains is only a small part, it is already very considerable. We are the excellent children of our ancestors. How to inherit this heritage and make it bloom more fragrant and beautiful flowers on the original basis is a major responsibility that we must all assume.

As long as art takes root among the broad masses of the people, no matter how it is destroyed, it will never die completely. There are still quite a few Chinese dance arts left in the folk. Among the fraternal ethnic groups in remote areas, their dance traditions are still relatively completely preserved. There are also dance movements in opera, which cannot be denied to be inherited from the tradition of Chinese classical dance. For example, the single sleeve shake and double sleeve shake cannot be said to have nothing in common with Da Chuishou, Xiao Chuishou, and Shuang Fu. There are many other examples that cannot be listed one by one; some people think that the movements in opera cannot be regarded as dance, but facts speak louder than words. The root of opera is song and dance. Although we do not have many complete solo performances of dance in Kunqu Opera and Beijing Opera, even the dance movements combined with the plot, its clear rhythm, elegant rhythm, healthy and beautiful lines, and powerful expressiveness clearly show the unique style of Chinese classical dance, which is not found anywhere else in the world. Dance in any place cannot be separated from music, but dance and song are mostly separated. In ancient China, singers did not dance, and dancers did not sing. Later, dancers gradually sang, and singers also danced. Moreover, except for a few dances without lyrics, dances are mostly made according to the lyrics (Japanese classical dance almost all have lyrics, and the dance movements are mostly arranged to match the meaning of the lyrics).

Dance is an independent art, and it cannot be separated from music, but it exists without relying on song. However, dance may also be combined with song: in ancient China, although dancers did not sing and singers did not dance, dancers danced on the stage and singers sang on the side, which was almost the same as our current "backing vocals." Song and dance were still coordinated. Japanese dancers never open their mouths to sing. As for one person singing and dancing, only Chinese opera is like that. Opera is mainly based on singing, not on dancing. In recent years, so-called dance movements have been gradually strengthened. In fact, only relatively slow and simple movements are suitable for singing. Forcing too fast and too complex dances to match singing will inevitably harm both.

Opera is divided into civil opera and martial opera—this can also be said to be the difference between health dance and soft dance. The movements of martial opera cannot be used in civil opera. If "A Dream in the Garden" uses the movements of "San Cha Kou," it will definitely not work. The small dance drama "A Dream in the Garden" performed by the Beijing Dance School before used many martial opera movements for Du Liniang and Liu Mengmei, plus ballet. This is of course a valuable and bold attempt, but according to Chinese customs, it is difficult to imagine someone like Liu Mengmei and someone like Du Liniang doing an acrobatic flip, a Kui Xing pointing at the Big Dipper, and then an Albert, while talking about love in the garden. Now they have revised it again.

The dance movements of opera have a long history of accumulation and are inevitably stylized, but they all have a basis in life. They are processed, beautified, and dance-like based on our movements in life. Getting in and out of the house, going up and down the stairs, rowing a boat, and riding a horse go without saying; Qi Ba is the movement and posture when wearing armor and preparing to go on an expedition, sleeve shaking comes from wide robes and large sleeves, and the movements of martial opera all have purposes (except for some vulgar performances), and cannot be despised because they are stylized. Moreover, just because there are programs does not mean that they cannot be used flexibly: the same movement has differences in size, speed, strength, and rigidity and softness. The effect on the plot and the character's personality and emotions often has a difference of a thousand miles. The dance movements of opera are very flexible, and this is worth our deep understanding. The movements of opera—especially the movements of Kunqu Opera and Beijing Opera—have a clear sculptural beauty and rhythm; there is also its accuracy. The reason why it can be so accurate is of course that the basic skills must be deep, and there is also a clear purpose, connecting one movement to another. The movements must be grasped from the heart, and these are also worth our learning.

The movements of opera are so-called hand, eye, body, method, and step—some people interpret them as five types: hand, eye, body, method, and step. According to my experience, it is hand, eye, body method, and step. Hand is the movement of the hand, eye is how to use the eyes, body method refers to the lines of the entire body and the movement of the waist, and step is the footwork, which is the movement of the feet; we pay attention to the hand, eye, and heart, that is, the hand and eye must be in place, and the waist and step must follow. Therefore, the hand, eye, body method, and step cooperate with each other to become a whole, with the character's personality and emotions as the thread, in order to achieve a theatrical purpose to flexibly, organically organize, and use, so that each movement can play its due role. If it is cut open, various dance movements are only equal to a letter, and cannot express a complete meaning alone. Therefore, I think it is convenient to teach students by classifying the dance movements in opera, but connecting many movements together, even if they are very beautiful, cannot become dance art. That is to say, a dance program must have its purpose of expression, and to achieve this purpose, select suitable movements, just like writing an article to select words and make sentences to organize it, so that it can become a complete work of art; the dance movements in opera must conform to this principle. Any dance movement that does not conform to the purpose of the play, no matter how high its technique is, is just random movement, and this should be paid attention to.

Most of the dance movements in opera are accompanied by songs and dialogue, and some are not; but no matter what, we cannot just move them over, or choose some movements and put them together to make it a dance program. It must be digested and used appropriately according to the creator's intention. At the same time, its characteristics must also be maintained. The dance movements of opera, like ballet, have their unique characteristics.

If the dance movements of opera are used appropriately, it is not impossible to absorb some of them and use them in new dances. The main thing is to see if they can be used naturally, so that there are no traces of patchwork. For example, the "Eighteen Sticks of Martial Opera" used in "Young Patriots" is not rigid, and the movements of "Mr. Dongguo" are also relatively appropriate.

Our folk dances were originally very rich. They have been constantly destroyed and lost too much! Some of the survivors have not been developed under long-term suppression. In the dance, women cannot appear on stage, so men disguise themselves as women to replace them, and there have also been some creations; however, in various provinces, whether it is Flower Drum or Tea-Picking Opera, it has always been prohibited. After liberation, thanks to the vigorous excavation by dance workers and their engagement in processing and sorting, all provinces have gained harvests, and the folk dances that were on the verge of extinction have appeared in a new light, generating new hope. I heard that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has recently discovered thirteen kinds of dances, and Yunnan, Fujian and other provinces have also made new discoveries. This is gratifying news. There are still many treasures of dance in the folk, and we must never allow them to be buried. We must rescue them in time, sort them out and develop them anew. This work is very important.

I think that when sorting out folk dances, we should study their basis in life, and try to maintain their customs and regional characteristics as much as possible. It is not appropriate to arbitrarily wash away its earthy atmosphere, and use colorful processing and transformation to make it unrecognizable. For example, the Flower Drum Lantern in Anhui was originally a mass entertainment on the square during the New Year and festivals. There were opening ceremonies, martial arts performances, things similar to acrobatics, and the so-called "Small Flower Field" mainly played by men and women flirting. Each small flower field is not continuous - some grab benches, some grab fans, and some grab handkerchiefs. The actors are performing on the stage, and the other actors and the audience are watching from the side, and they can occasionally interrupt to make fun. As a whole, there are very good dance materials, but it is not a complete dance. It is a very good intention for us to take it and reorganize it to make it a group of dances. But if the small flower field is mainly enlarged to become a team dance, and ten pairs of young men and women are used to perform grabbing handkerchiefs and grabbing fans at the same time, it is not reasonable. Or one pair is performing flirting, and the other pairs are watching and making fun of them, or taking turns doing it is also inappropriate.

The dances of all fraternal ethnic groups have their long historical traditions, and each dance has a basis in life, and has a deep and inseparable relationship with their labor, customs, and historical traditions, thus forming their style. They can also absorb the dances of other ethnic groups to enrich themselves, push their dances to a new stage and produce new creations; but dance workers should be especially cautious if they want to process the dances of fraternal ethnic groups and change their original appearance. First of all, they cannot violate their customs, and they must maintain their style and express their emotions. For example, if the Tibetan "Jumping Guozhuang" and the Yao "Long Drum Dance" are separated from their basis in life and their local characteristics are removed, their artistic value will be lost.

Most of the dances of fraternal ethnic groups are very healthy and simple, and have a very strong atmosphere of life. This characteristic must be paid attention to, and we should learn from them. Can we also create according to the mood of certain dances of fraternal ethnic groups and adopt their movements as materials? I think this is also possible. For example, the Peacock Dance of the Central Song and Dance Troupe is marked as a Dai dance. It is said that the Dai people attach great importance to peacocks (the Han people like peacocks only second to phoenixes), and the Dai peacock dance is a solo dance, with a peacock tail tied to the body, and the screen can be opened by pulling the rope. Now the Peacock Dance of the Central Song and Dance Troupe is a group dance, and a group of girls' skirts are embroidered with peacock feather patterns. The dance has imitation movements such as spreading wings and sucking water, as well as jumping and rotating movements to express the meaning of flying. The posture is lively and light, and it looks gorgeous. This dance is very different from the Dai peacock dance in terms of content, form, and style. It is difficult to regard it as a processed and sorted out work based on the original foundation of the Dai dance. It seems that it can only be regarded as a creation.

Dance art has its unique expression methods. Its scope of expression is not as wide as that of drama and opera, let alone as wide as that of film. Dance is to convey emotions by actions alone. Dance and sculpture have extremely similar points: sculpture is valuable because it can capture the image left by a character in a moment and express the peak of an emotion. Dance can be said to be active sculpture, it expresses the height of emotional concentration. Therefore, it is inappropriate to ask a dance to express political theories, complex events, direct lessons, or the natural forms of life.

Putting many sections of dance together organically to become a dance drama, its scope of expression also has certain limitations. The themes of dance dramas cannot be completely the same as those of dramas and operas. Some themes are suitable for dance creation, and some themes are not suitable. For example, the transformation of industry and commerce and the selection of advanced producers are not themes that dance art can express, so they have to be left to drama and film.

It seems easy to adapt fables into dances, but the effect is not necessarily good. Fables mainly use hypothetical stories to satirize certain people or phenomena in society. It does not involve the character and emotions of the characters. Each fable must use two sentences at the end to highlight the theme. Without these two sentences, it will not be eye-catching. Using the form of dance to perform fables, the audience has to rely on their imagination to highlight the theme, which is difficult. No matter how well the "Snipe and Clam" program is danced, the artistic effect is not high. Which aspect does the audience sympathize with among the clam, the snipe, and the fisherman? Originally, this story came from "Strategies of the Warring States": Yan wanted to attack Zhao, and Su Dai said to the King of Yan: When I came to Yan this time, I passed by the Yishui River and saw a clam basking in the sun. A snipe went to peck its meat, and the clam clamped the bird's head. The bird said: If it doesn't rain today and it doesn't rain tomorrow, you will die. The clam said: If your head can't be pulled out, you will lose your life. The two held each other to see who could last longer, and as a result, they were caught by the fisherman together. Now that Yan and Zhao are fighting each other, I think the State of Qin is coming. This fable is a lesson for both sides to hold each other, and the third party benefits, which is meaningful. As a fable, it is interesting and has literary value, but it is not very appropriate to adapt it into a dance work. A beautiful girl playing a clam spirit is very popular with the audience, and another girl plays a bird, which also dances quite interestingly. It is difficult to imagine that they are two bad guys, and the fisherman does not seem to be particularly commendable. Moreover, a clam clamping the bird's head is not a good stage image. I think it is okay to insert a small section of a fable in a large dance drama if necessary. Adapting a fable into an independent small dance drama is not easy to achieve the effect of a dance drama, nor is it easy to achieve the effect of a fable.

Regarding the creation of dance, the creation of dance dramas, and the processing and sorting of folk dances and fraternal ethnic dances, the Soviet Union has extremely rich and extremely valuable advanced experience. We must learn more and better from the Soviet Union in terms of theory and practice. It is also very necessary for us to learn from the dances of Eastern countries. The national dances of India, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Myanmar, Vietnam, etc. all have their excellent traditions, and have always had exchanges with China in history. If we want to study the history of Chinese dance, we especially cannot ignore the dances of Eastern countries, including the dances of Central Asian countries.

Widely absorbing the dances of Eastern and Western countries and various ethnic groups and referring to and learning from them will be of great help to our dance creation. Now we have full conditions to do this, and we can learn and absorb as much as possible. The main source of dance creation is of course the lives of the people. In order to develop dance art, we must also learn more from sister arts. Music, sculpture, painting, drama, and literature are closely related to dance art. Dance requires a high degree of concentration of thoughts, emotions, and images; this is the same as sculpture. Dance should learn from painting the various techniques of creating images, composing pictures, and using colors; dance should have the realm of poetry, and dance art cannot be separated from poetry, it is dependent on poetry; dance is connected to music by blood, and where there is dance, there must be music. Is it that there is dance to match music? Or is it that dance is created according to music? I think both are possible, and this should not become a matter of dispute. Also, should dancers learn from drama? I think Ulanova has a self-description that is the best answer.

In her "Self-Description of a Dance Drama Actor," Ulanova talked about a friend of hers who was a drama actor, Elizaveta Timé, who often used extremely keen discernment to analyze the roles played by Ulanova, pointing out failures and successes. Ulanova said: I don't think there is anything more valuable to me than this. She also said: Timé told me what the White Swan should feel, and told me about the subtle changes in emotions that I hadn't even imagined, and I gradually realized that all dramatic arts have a common source. This is very important. The profound understanding of the expression methods of sister arts can be used to inspire one's own mind and exercise skills, which is not the same as hard moving. The idea of hard moving is absolutely undesirable.

Therefore, I think dance art is the most difficult art. A dancer must have the basic training of his own business, rich life experience, and a relatively deep literary and artistic accomplishment; and more importantly, he must understand the basic principles of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics and the creative methods of socialist realism. All of this can get the best and most practical help from sister arts.

    我们要发扬中国舞蹈艺术的优良传统
    欧阳予倩
    有些人以为中国没有舞蹈艺术，我们要大声地告诉这些人，中国在一千多年以前就已经有了十分优秀、极为丰富的舞蹈艺术。我们的舞蹈艺术有它悠久与优良的传统，不容忽视。
      舞蹈起源于劳动，举一个最近的例子：像西藏舞的“卓”，便是从筑墙的动作发展出来的。瑶族的“长鼓舞”，表现的是造房子或者是制造长鼓的动作。我们原始的舞蹈有的拿着牛尾巴舞，也有拿着鸟的羽毛舞的，表现的是狩猎。古代的舞字，就是一个人两手拿着牛尾巴在跳。古代祀神的舞，也是跟劳动相结合着的。神是人在和自然斗争中的一种想像。祀神的舞不是求丰年就是禳灾难。傩舞是为着驱恶鬼的。古代的巫就是用舞蹈来敬神的专家。
    上古的时候，舞蹈的名称见诸记载的也还不少。主要是描写狩猎、战阵。还有就是祭祀的仪式。此外就是男女相爱的舞。这一些都直接和人民的生活有关。
    我们周朝（公元前七世纪）由于经济文化的发展，音乐舞蹈都很发达。在舞蹈方面，把原始的舞蹈形式组织成了非常整齐的队伍（如大武、八佾舞），它的内容也比从前复杂了。而且那时把贵族子弟学习舞蹈规定在制度当中。如：“十三舞勺，成童舞象”。在民间，舞蹈也很发达，如诗经陈风就描写了男女欢喜舞蹈那种狂热的情形。
    汉朝有一个最大的特点，由于国家统一以后，经济、文化、武力都比较发达。那时国势较强，跟西域的交通开辟了道路，从国内外各处来的百戏一时荟萃在西京。百戏主要是杂技，其中也有舞蹈；可能有某些节目，舞蹈和杂技交织在一起不容易分别；也还有表演故事片断的东西，像东海黄公之类。我想百戏对刺激舞蹈的发展和推进舞蹈艺术起了很大的作用。例如当时最流行的“七盘舞”，根据现存的拓片和记载，可能最初是百戏的一种；后来经过不断加工便成了舞蹈艺术。根据后汉傅毅的舞赋，这个舞是很美妙的。
    南北朝的时候，西域的乐舞大量输入，印度的乐舞也跟着佛教传进来，极为盛行（西域乐舞及佛教音乐传入中国不是从南北朝才开始的）。北朝盛行西域乐舞，南朝则盛行清商乐，所谓“江南吴歌，荆楚四声”。舞蹈有公莫、白紵、白鸠等舞。象舞技当中大垂手、小垂手的舞法，在梁简文帝的诗中就已经提到，一直沿用到唐宋之间。
    隋朝统一了中国，把南朝的、北朝的、外国的、中国的、宫庭的、民间的乐舞集中起来成为九部伎。在宫庭方面有大规模的音乐、舞蹈和百戏的组织。在民间也有一些舞蹈的创作。
    唐太宗李世民统一中国，国势昌盛，版图扩大，在盛唐期间差不多有一百多年生活比较安定，经济和文化迅速发展。在乐舞方面，继承了隋朝九部伎的旧制，又不断地加以发展，在这个时候，音乐舞蹈可以说集古今中外之大成。在中国的音乐史、舞蹈史上是一个最重要的时期。单就舞蹈而言，也就有辉煌的成就。
    在简短的篇幅中，要把唐代的舞蹈加以比较系统的说明是不可能的，我想举几个特点谈一谈：
    唐代乐舞的特点，规模宏大自不必说，当时，杂技和舞蹈显然是分开了，舞蹈成了独立的艺术；技巧和艺术性都加强了。第二，外国的、边疆的、少数民族的以及民间的各种舞蹈，集中在长安，非但在宫庭及士大夫间经常表演，就在民间也广泛流传，丰富了当时的舞蹈艺术。第三，外来的舞蹈艺术，经过长时期的酝酿，到了唐代就起了很大的变化，有些舞蹈，经过加工，它的内容和形式起了变化，有的舞蹈跟汉族原有的舞蹈或其他民族的舞蹈相结合，就变成另外的新的东西。当然这种变化不像今天这样快，而是相当缓慢的。第四，各种舞蹈艺术以及百戏当中的某些技术，经过艺人们的融会贯通，有新的创作。第五，根据新的乐曲，创作了新的舞蹈；第六，舞蹈和诗词比过去结合得更好一些，产生了新的形式。
    宋朝的歌舞规模不如唐朝，可是舞蹈艺术也还是有新的发展；宋朝的队舞，说得出名称的有二十多种，舞曲和服饰大抵是沿用唐代的。
    中国的乐舞，从汉朝起就受了外国影响，尤其是唐朝，西域的乐舞大量输入，我们不仅受了他们的影响，而且吸收了不少东西，丰富了我们的舞蹈艺术，发展了舞蹈创作。但是吸收外来的东西，也并不是盲目地毫无选择的。有些外来的舞蹈，刚进来的时候，哄动一时，久而久之也就不大受欢迎，并没有广泛地流传开去，例如“泼寒胡戏”（许多人骑在马上，背着盛水的口袋，泼马下的人的一种游戏。）曾经引起大家的好奇心，可是后来只留下所用的曲子“苏幕遮”，和改变了面貌的“浑脱舞”。胡旋胡腾两种舞，都曾入宫庭，也曾在民间流传，但没有被吸收推广，大约那种跳得高转得快的舞蹈，当时的人并不很习惯。看敦煌唐朝的壁画，伎乐的舞女都是赤足光膀子，披着风带的，这显然是根据印度的生活描画出来的仙女，可是无论从文字的记载中，或者绘画、雕刻和出土的泥俑去看，我们的舞女从来没有不穿衣服不着鞋袜的。像柘枝舞，原来是一个人跳的，后来加成两个人，名叫双柘枝；到了宋朝就五个人跳，在中间的人叫“花心”；后来发展到二十四个人。在音乐方面这个舞和大曲结合了，而且在舞的组织方面加上竹竿子念致语，花心念词唱歌，还有齐唱；有的内容也改变了，成为莲花舞或莲花台舞，也有表演采莲的。在服装方面，原来是窄袖、银带、头戴卷檐的尖帽子，上边有铃铛，后来有所改变，尖顶帽子改用凤冠。像这样的舞就完全变了中国的东西，它的表现形式完全跟中国的风俗习惯结合起来了。可见当时对外来的艺术，需要的就吸收过来，逐渐消化成为自己的东西；认为不适合的，就根据大多数人的倾向有所去取。变化当然是慢慢地、经过比较长时间的。
    还有一个特点，就是中国的舞蹈艺术也和中国的音乐一样，是由各族人民共同创造出来的，是我们民族大家庭共有的财富。
    中国的舞蹈艺术不仅从国外吸收了很多好东西丰富了自己，发展了创作；在唐宋两代，曾给与朝鲜、日本以很大的影响：唐宋的乐舞流传到了日本的很多，现在还有大部分保存下来，如：“兰陵王”、“春莺啭”、“胡饮酒”、“破阵乐”等等。日本博物馆还存有唐代传过去的假面，朝鲜的音乐千多年前早已就传到中国，隋朝的九部伎中就有高丽部；后来唐宋的音乐舞蹈，又大量传到朝鲜。“乐学轨范”一书是明朝送给朝鲜的，其中所载的乐舞全部是中国的，到了朝鲜之后，跟朝鲜的舞蹈相结合有所改变，成了朝鲜的艺术，构成了特有的风格。
    唐朝的乐舞，经安禄山乱后就差多了。宋朝舞蹈的规模已不如唐朝，元明的统治者对于音乐舞蹈没有知识，也就不感兴趣。加之宋朝程朱理学的影响，强调“非礼勿视，非礼勿听”，还要“非礼勿言”。封建统治者以理学治天下，极力桎梏青年人的思想行为，对民间乐舞视为“淫哇”。男人都要“非礼勿视，非礼勿听”，女人更只能裹着小脚，深闭闺中，慢说跳舞，就是到大门口去看看街都会被议论。
    至于民间乐舞，从古以来就被统治者限制，往往遭到禁止，一则说是怕妨碍农事，又说怕影响风化，还有就是上等社会的娱乐品不许民间占有：唐、宋、元、明、清五朝都有禁止民间娱乐的条文。中国音乐舞蹈，尤其是舞蹈，从宋朝以后，逐渐衰落，原有的东西几乎大都丧失，很多已不可考。除了以上的原因，还有就是时间艺术很难保存，过去除了文字之外，没有足以保存这些东西的工具。特别经过战争，一抢一烧一杀就把积累下来的艺术财富弄得精光，使我们今天研究舞蹈史的，要想继承民族文化遗产的人们不能不从断瓦残砖和仅存的壁画、泥俑、零星的文字记载中去寻找痕迹。但是尽管如此，我们的资料还是异常的丰富，几千年的文化历史给我们积累了巨大的财富，剩下来的尽管是极小的一部分，已经就大为可观。我们是我们祖先优秀的儿女，怎样来承继这份遗产，使它在原有的基础上，开出更芬芳美丽的花朵，是我们大家必须负起来的重大责任。
    艺术只要在广大人民群众当中生了根，无论受到怎样的摧残，总不会完全死灭。中国的舞蹈艺术，遗留在民间的也还不少。边远地区兄弟民族当中，还都比较完整地保存着他们的舞蹈传统。还有就是戏曲当中的舞蹈动作，不能否认是继承了中国古典舞蹈的传统，例如单抖袖，双抖袖不能说和大垂手、小垂手，双拂没有共同之点。此外例子很多不能一一列举；有人认为戏曲中的动作不能算舞蹈，但事实胜于雄辩。戏曲的根源是歌舞。尽管我们在昆曲京戏当中成套的单独表演的舞蹈不多，就是跟剧情相结合的舞蹈动作，它那种鲜明的节奏，幽雅的韵律，健康美丽的线条，强大的表现力，显然看得出中国古典舞蹈特有的风格，这是世界任何一个地方所没有的。任何地方的舞蹈，都不能离开音乐，可是舞跟歌多半是分开的，中国古代歌者不舞，舞者不歌。后来逐渐舞者也歌，歌者也舞，而且除了少数的舞蹈没有歌词外，舞蹈多半根据歌词来制作（日本的古典舞，几乎都有歌词，舞的动作多半是配合歌词的意思安排的）。
    舞蹈是独立的艺术，它离不开音乐，但不依赖歌而存在。不过舞蹈也可能与歌相结合：中国古代尽管舞者不歌，歌者不舞，但舞者在场上舞，歌者在一旁唱，就和我们现时的“伴唱”差不多的样子，歌和舞仍然是配合着的。日本舞者从来不开口唱。至于一个人载歌载舞只有中国的戏曲是那样。戏曲以歌唱为主，不以舞蹈为主。近年来才逐渐加强了所谓舞蹈动作。事实上歌时只适宜于比较缓慢简单的动作，勉强用太快太复杂的舞蹈去配合歌唱，结果必致两受其害。
    戏曲分文戏和武戏——这也可以说是健舞与软舞之别吧。文戏不能用武戏的身段，如果“游园惊梦”用“三岔口”的身段那一定不行。以前北京舞蹈学校所演的小舞剧“惊梦”，杜丽娘和柳梦梅都用了许多武戏身段，再加上芭蕾，这当然是可贵的大胆尝试，但是根据中国的习惯，像柳梦梅那样的相公和杜丽娘那样的小姐，在花园里谈情说爱的时候，很难想像会来个鹞子翻身、来个魁星点斗，再接上一个阿尔贝斯。现在他们又从新改过了。
    戏曲的舞蹈动作有悠长的历史积累，不免是程式化的，但都有其生活根据。它是根据我们生活中的动作加工美化、舞蹈化的。出门进门，上楼下楼，摇船走马自不必说；起霸是穿戴盔甲准备出征时的动作姿态，抖袖是由于宽袍大袖来的，武戏的动作都有目的（有些庸俗的表演例外），并不能以为程式化便加以轻视。而且并不因为有程式就不能灵活运用：同样一个动作有大小、快慢、强弱、刚柔之别，对于戏情和人物的性格感情所起作用，往往有毫厘千里之差，戏曲的舞蹈动作是很有弹性的，这一点值得我们加以深刻的体会。戏曲的动作——特别是昆剧和京戏的动作，具有鲜明的雕塑美和节奏感；还有就是它的准确性，其所以能够十分准确，当然基本工夫要下得深，还有就是有明确的目的，把一个一个动作连贯起来。动作要从内心掌握它的分寸，这些也是十分值得我们学习的。
    戏曲的动作所谓手眼身法步——有人解释为手、眼、身、法、步五种。据我的体会是手、眼、身法和步，手是手的动作，眼就是如何运用眼睛，身法指的是整个身体的线条和腰部的动作，步就是步法，就是脚的动作；我们讲究手到眼到心到，既是手到眼到，腰和步必须跟随着，所以手眼身法步互相配合成为一个整体，以人物的性格和感情为贯串，为着达到一个戏剧的目的来灵活地有机地组织运用，这样每个动作才都能起它应有的作用。如果把它割开来，各种各样的舞蹈动作都只等于一个字母，单独不能表达一个完整的意思，所以我认为把戏曲中的舞蹈动作分类来教学生是有便利的，但是把许多动作串连起来，即使很美，并不能成为舞蹈艺术。也就是说一个舞蹈节目必有它表现的目的，为达到这个目的而选择适合的动作，好比做文章选词造句一样加以组织，才能使它成为一个完整的艺术品；戏曲当中的舞蹈动作必须符合于这个原则。不合于戏的目的的任何舞蹈动作，不管它技术怎么高，都只是乱动，这一点应当加以注意。
    戏曲里头舞蹈动作大半是有歌和白伴随着，也有不伴着歌白的；但不管怎么样，我们不可能随便搬过来，或者是选择一些动作一凑，就使它成为一个舞蹈节目。必须经过消化，根据创作者的意图适当地运用。同时也还必须保持它的特点，戏曲的舞蹈动作也和芭蕾一样，有它独具的特点。
    戏曲的舞蹈动作如果运用适当，吸取一些用在新的舞蹈里也不是不可能的，主要是看能否用得自然，使它没有拼凑的痕迹。例如“少年爱国者”当中用了“武戏的十八棍”，并不生硬，“东郭先生”的身段也是比较合适的。
    我国民间的舞蹈，原来也是很丰富的。它不断地遭受摧残，丧失得太多了！有些幸存的也长期在压制之下得不到发展。在舞蹈中，女子不能出场，就用男扮女来代替，也有过一些创造；但是在各省不管是花鼓也好，采茶戏也好，一向还是被禁止的。解放以后由于舞蹈工作者的大力发掘，并从事加工整理，各省都有收获，使濒于消灭的民间舞蹈出现了新的面目，产生了新的希望。听说最近内蒙古自治区就发见了十三种舞蹈，云南、福建等省也有新的发见，这是可喜的消息。民间还有很多舞蹈的财富，我们决不能听其湮没，要及时抢救，加以整理使其得到新的发展，这一工作十分重要。
    整理民间舞蹈我以为应当研究它的生活根据，要尽可能保持它的风俗习惯和地区的特点。不宜随意洗净它的泥土气息，和以花花绿绿的加工改造使它面目全非。例如安徽的花鼓灯，原来是新年和节日广场上的群众娱乐。有出场的仪式，有武工表演，有类似杂技的东西，有扮演以男女调笑为主的所谓“小花场”。每个小花场是不连贯的——有的抢板凳，有的抢扇子、抢手巾。场上在表演，其他的演员都和观众一同在旁边看，他们也可以偶然打一打岔以资笑乐。整个地看，其中有很好的舞蹈素材，却不是一个完整的舞蹈。我们拿来加以新的组织使它成为一组舞蹈是很好的意图。但如果以小花场为主加以扩大成为队舞，用上十对男女青年同时来表演抢手巾、抢扇子那就不近情理。或者一对在表演调笑，另几对在旁边看着打趣，或者轮流照做也都不适当。
    各兄弟民族的舞蹈，都有他们悠长的历史传统，每一个舞蹈都有生活根据，跟他们的劳动、风俗习惯，跟他们的历史传统有深厚的不可分的关系，由此而形成他们的风格。他们也可以吸收其他民族的舞蹈来丰富自己，把他们的舞蹈推进到一个新的阶段而产生新的创作；但是舞蹈工作者如果要把兄弟民族的舞蹈加工，改变他们原有的面目，那就应当特别慎重。首先就不能违反他们的风俗习惯，要保持他们的风格，表达他们的感情。例如：藏族的“跳锅庄”，瑶族的“长鼓舞”，如果离开了它们的生活习惯根据，去掉它们的地方色彩，它的艺术价值也没有了。
    兄弟民族的舞蹈大半都是非常健康朴素，生活气息非常浓厚的。这个特点必须加以注意，应当向他们学习。我们是不是也可根据兄弟民族某些舞蹈的情调，采取他们的动作作为素材进行创作呢？我想这也是可以的。例如中央歌舞团的孔雀舞，标明是傣族的舞蹈。据说傣族很重视孔雀（汉族喜欢孔雀也仅次于凤凰），傣族的孔雀舞是单人舞，身上扎一个孔雀尾巴，绳子一拉就可以开屏。现在中央歌舞团的孔雀舞是群舞，一群姑娘们裙子上绣着孔雀翎的花纹。舞有展翅、吸水等的模拟动作，也有跳跃旋转表示飞翔之意的动作。姿态活泼轻盈，看起来是华美的。这个舞和傣族的孔雀舞，无论是内容和形式、风格都大不相同，这就很难看作是根据傣族的舞蹈传统在原有的基础上加工整理出来的东西，这似乎只能看作是创作。
    舞蹈艺术有它独特的表现方法，它表现的范围不如话剧、歌剧那样宽广，更不如电影那样宽广。舞蹈是单独用动作来传达感情的。舞蹈和雕刻有极为近似之处：雕刻贵能抓住人物一刹那间留下的形象，表现一个感情的顶点。舞蹈可以说是活动的雕刻，它表现的是感情的高度集中。所以要求一段舞蹈表现政治理论、复杂的事件或者是直接的教训、生活的自然形态等等，都是不适当的。
    把许多段的舞蹈有机地联接起来成为舞剧，它的表现范围也有一定的限度，舞剧的题材是不可以完全同于话剧歌剧的。有的题材适宜于舞蹈创作，有的题材不适宜，例如工商业改造、选拔先进生产者这一类的题材不是舞蹈艺术所能表现的，只好让给话剧和电影。
    寓言改编成舞蹈，似乎很容易，但效果并不一定好。寓言主要以假设的故事讽刺社会的某些人或某些现象，它并不涉及人物的性格和感情。每一个寓言最后必用两句话点题，少了这两句话就不醒目。用舞蹈的形式表演寓言，点题的地方就只好听凭观众的想像，这就有困难。“鹬蚌相持”这个节目，不管舞得怎么好，艺术效果是不高的。蚌、鹬、渔翁三者之间，观众同情哪一方面呢？原来这个故事出自“战国策”：燕要伐赵，苏代对燕王说：我这次到燕国来从易水经过，看见一个蚌壳在晒太阳，鹬鸟去啄它的肉，蚌壳就夹住了鸟的头，鸟说：今天不下雨，明天不下雨，你就死了。蚌说：你的头拔不出，你也就会没命。两者相持看谁耗得过谁，结果被渔翁一同逮了去。如今燕赵相持我看秦国就要来了。这个寓言是给两者相持，第三者得利的教训，是有意义的，作为寓言是有趣味的，有文学价值的，但把它改编成舞蹈作品，并不很适当。一个漂亮姑娘扮的蚌壳精，很受观众欢迎，另一个姑娘扮一个鸟，跳得也颇有趣，很难设想它们是两个坏蛋，渔翁也看不出特别值得称赞的地方，而且一个蚌壳夹住那个鸟的头，舞台形象也并不佳妙。我想在一个大的舞剧当中如果有必要穿插一小节寓言未尝不可。把寓言改编成一个独立的小舞剧，既不容易收到舞剧的效果，也难收到寓言的效果。
    关于舞蹈的创作跟舞剧的创作，以及对民间舞蹈和兄弟民族舞蹈的加工和整理，苏联有极其丰富、极为宝贵的先进经验，我们必须从理论方面、实际方面更多更好地向苏联学习。还有我们很有必要向东方各国的舞蹈学习，印度、朝鲜、日本、印度尼西亚、缅甸、越南等国民族舞蹈，都有他们优秀的传统，而且在历史上跟中国也一直有交流。如果我们要研究中国的舞蹈史，尤其不能忽略东方诸国的舞蹈，包括中亚细亚诸国的舞蹈在内。
    广泛吸收东西各国、各民族的舞蹈，参考借鉴，这对于我们的舞蹈创作，有极大的帮助，现在我们具备着充分的条件这样来做，我们可以尽量学习尽量吸收。舞蹈创作的主要源泉当然是人民的生活。为了发展舞蹈艺术，还必须多多地向姊妹艺术学习。音乐、雕刻、绘画、戏剧、文学都跟舞蹈艺术有密切的关系，舞蹈要求思想感情和形象高度集中；这和雕刻一样，舞蹈要从绘画当中学得人物造象、构图，运用色彩的种种技巧；舞蹈应当有诗的境界，舞蹈艺术离不开诗，它和诗是相依为命的；舞蹈跟音乐血肉相连，有了舞蹈必有音乐。是有了舞蹈配音乐呢？还是根据音乐创作舞蹈呢？我认为都可以，这不成为争论的问题。还有就是舞蹈家是不是应当向戏剧学习呢？我想乌兰诺娃有一段自述是最好的答案。
    乌兰诺娃在她的“一个舞剧演员的自述”中谈到她有一个话剧演员的朋友，伊丽查维塔·季梅，她常以极其敏锐的辨别力来分析乌兰诺娃所扮演的角色，指出失败和成功之处，乌兰诺娃说：我觉得对我来说，没有比这个更宝贵的了。她还说：季梅告诉了我，白天鹅应有的感觉是什么，并把那种我甚至没有设想到的感情变化的细微之处讲给我听，我也确实逐渐了解到一切戏剧艺术都有着一个共同源泉。这一点非常重要，对姊妹艺术的表现方法的深刻体会，用来启发自己的心灵，锻炼技巧，并不等于硬搬。硬搬的思想是绝对要不得的。
    所以我觉得舞蹈艺术是最难的艺术，一个舞蹈家要有本身业务的基本锻炼，要有丰富的生活经验，要有较深的文学艺术修养；还有更重要的，要懂得马克思列宁主义美学的基本原理，和社会主义现实主义的创作方法。这一切都能从姊妹艺术取得最好的最实际的帮助。
