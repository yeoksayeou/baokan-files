The failure of Anglo-French blackmail over the Suez issue and their military aggression against Egypt greatly weakened British influence in the Middle East and North Africa. Having suffered a heavy blow, British colonialists believe that it is even more important to maintain their colonial rule in Cyprus, a strategic point, and use Cyprus as a base to maintain their remaining influence in the region and seek to recover.

Therefore, the military suppression of the Cypriot people, who are demanding national self-determination, has been intensified. A large number of invading troops withdrawn from Egypt were transferred to Cyprus. On December 18 last year, British Governor Harding announced that he would continue to suppress the Cypriot people's anti-colonial rule movement. A large-scale attack was launched on the national independence movement. Paratrooper units were also thrown into the so-called mopping-up war. The colonial authorities unreasonably arrested dozens of so-called "rebels" and sentenced six young people who participated in the movement for national self-determination to life imprisonment on charges of "conspiracy" against the "Cypriot authorities." At the end of last year, the British colonial authorities in Cyprus announced that in 1957 they would transfer several "experienced" battalions from Malaya to reinforce the colonial forces and further strengthen military suppression.

It seems that British colonialists have not learned the lessons they should have learned from the repeated failures of their colonial policies. However, after all, British colonialists have lost confidence in suppressing the increasingly high tide of the Cypriot national independence movement by relying solely on violent suppression. At the same time, they cannot fail to see the widespread international support for the Cypriot people's demands for national self-determination and the increasing condemnation of British colonial rule. Therefore, while continuing to intensify military suppression, British colonialists have also intensified political deception.

In mid-December last year, British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd suddenly went to Athens and Ankara to discuss the Cyprus issue with the Greek and Turkish governments and put forward a so-called "new" solution to the Cyprus issue—the "constitutional proposal" of Duke Radcliffe. While strengthening the reign of terror, Harding also pretended to announce that he would "relax" certain emergency regulations, hoping to create an atmosphere to better consider the "recommendations on the Cyprus constitution" put forward by Britain.

The so-called "constitutional proposal" of Duke Radcliffe is nothing but a trick, using a constitutional cloak to disguise the continued colonial rule of Britain in Cyprus. This "constitutional proposal" grants the British Governor unlimited power and does not recognize the right of self-determination of the Cypriot people. According to the "constitution" in this proposal, the major powers of diplomacy, national defense and public security will still be completely controlled by the Governor appointed by the British government. Although some other unimportant government functions will be controlled by the Chief Minister and the cabinet elected by the Legislative Assembly, they are also subject to reservations. Moreover, the "constitution" expressly stipulates that "bills passed by the Legislative Assembly shall not become law without the consent of the Governor." The Chief Minister and other ministers shall be appointed by the Governor, and the Governor shall have the power to remove the Chief Minister at any time.

Even such a decorative "constitutional proposal" will only be implemented by Britain after it is "convinced that there is indeed a situation in Cyprus where genuine elections can be held without the influence of 'violence' and 'intimidation,'" that is, after Britain has established its colonial order in Cyprus.

Obviously, the purpose of the British colonialists in putting forward such a "constitutional proposal" is only to use this deceptive activity to ease the Cypriot people's anti-colonial struggle and resist the pressure of international public opinion in order to continue to maintain its colonial rule in Cyprus.

However, the Cypriot people neither succumb to violent suppression nor are deceived by political tricks. They persisted in the struggle for the right to national self-determination. The victory of the Egyptian and other Middle Eastern peoples in their struggle against colonialism has encouraged their fighting will and determination. Their cause has won the widespread sympathy and support of people and governments of all countries who uphold justice and love peace. At the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which is discussing the Cyprus issue, representatives of many countries supported the Cypriot people's demand for the right to national self-determination and believed that the United Nations should support this demand for rights recognized by the United Nations Charter.

As for that deceptive "constitutional" activity, it has been widely resisted by the Cypriot people from the very beginning. Many organizations and groups stated that they demand self-determination and are unwilling to discuss the so-called "constitution" with the British "constitutional commissioner." The "Struggle for Cyprus" Political Committee issued a statement saying: "The only response we can express to these proposals is the determination to continue our struggle for true freedom." The Cypriot people answered the British colonialists' "constitutional" conspiracy with demonstrations, strikes, and market strikes. On February 18, the day when the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began to discuss the Cyprus issue, the people of Cyprus held another strike against British colonial rule and demanded national self-determination. The Greek government also correctly pointed out that the British proposal was a "new attempt at political blackmail, the purpose of which is to make the principle of self-determination impossible to achieve." It refused to discuss the plan with Britain and Turkey. Its representative put forward a proposal in the United Nations requesting the United Nations to recognize the Cypriot people's right to self-determination.

Whenever things relate to the actual satisfaction of the national aspirations of the colonial people, the United States, which sings high praises for supporting the independence demands of weak and small nations, always reveals its fox tail. On the Cyprus issue, as on other colonial issues such as Algeria and West Irian, the United States has taken action to support colonial rule, which is seriously threatened by the national independence movement. After Britain put forward the above-mentioned deceptive "constitutional proposal," U.S. State Department spokesman White commented that the plan "can serve as a first step in finding a final and universally acceptable solution to the Cyprus issue." In order to put pressure on Greece and force it to change its attitude, the U.S. government recently decided to cut its economic aid to Greece by 50%. The U.S. government has its own plans for this support for British colonialists on the Cyprus issue. Greek newspapers pointed out that due to the new U.S. policy in the Near East, British and American troops may jointly use Cyprus. The U.S. plan for Cyprus is related to the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine"—the U.S. attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries. There are also reports that the U.S. State Department has drafted a plan that advocates handing Cyprus over to the European Commission for five years of "trusteeship" and that the defense be the responsibility of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This shows that the U.S. government itself is attempting to get involved in Cyprus, replacing the old British colonial rule with American-style colonial rule, and using Cyprus as a strategic base for the U.S. to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Living on a lonely island, subjected to the joint oppression and brutal suppression of imperialist colonial forces, the struggle of the Cypriot people is very arduous. However, today the anti-colonialist struggle of the people of all countries in the world has formed an irresistible historical tide. The colonial aggression policy of imperialist countries has become increasingly unpopular. It is becoming increasingly difficult for Britain to continue to maintain its colonial rule in Cyprus. Neither cannons nor deceptive methods of "constitution," nor the support of U.S. imperialists with ulterior motives, can stop the Cypriot people's tide of struggle for national self-determination. Their national self-determination demands must be met.

    塞浦路斯人民的民族要求一定要得到满足
    谢文煊
    英法在苏伊士问题上的敲诈和对埃及发动的军事侵略的失败，使英国在西亚北非地区的势力大为削弱。受了重创的英国殖民主义者认为，继续保持他在战略要点塞浦路斯的殖民统治，把塞浦路斯作为基地来维持他在这一地区里的残存势力，徐图恢复，是更加重要了。
    因此，对要求民族自决的塞浦路斯人民的军事镇压加紧进行起来了。从埃及撤出的侵略军队大量调驻塞浦路斯。去年12月18日；英国总督哈定宣布他要继续镇压塞浦路斯人民的反殖民统治运动。对民族独立运动发动了大规模的袭击。伞兵部队也被投进了所谓扫荡战。殖民当局无理逮捕了几十名所谓“叛乱分子”；并以“阴谋”反对“塞浦路斯当局”的罪名判处了六名参加争取民族自决运动的青年以无期徒刑。去年年底，塞浦路斯的英国殖民当局又宣布，在1957年将从马来亚调几个有“经验”的营，增援殖民部队，进一步加强军事镇压。
    看来英国殖民主义者并没有从他的殖民政策的一再失败中获得应有的教训。可是，毕竟英国殖民主义者对于单纯依凭暴力镇压来压服塞浦路斯日益高涨的民族独立运动，是已经失去信心了；同时，他也不能不看到国际上对塞浦路斯人民民族自决要求的广泛支持和对英国殖民统治的愈来愈多的谴责。所以，在继续加紧军事镇压的同时，英国殖民主义者也加紧了政治欺骗活动。
    去年12月中旬，英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德突然到雅典和安卡拉同希腊和土耳其政府讨论塞浦路斯问题，并提出了一个所谓解决塞浦路斯问题的“新”方案——拉德克利夫公爵的“宪法建议”。哈定在加强恐怖统治的同时，又装模作样地宣布将“放松”某些紧急条例，希望造成一种气氛以便更好地考虑英国提出的“关于塞浦路斯宪法的建议”。
    所谓拉德克利夫公爵的“宪法建议”，不过是一个花样，用一种立宪的外衣把英国在塞浦路斯继续保持的殖民统治装扮起来。这个“宪法建议”给予英国总督以无限权力，而没有承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权利。根据这个建议中的“宪法”，外交、国防和治安大权仍将完全由英国政府任命的总督一手掌握。其他的一些无关紧要的政府职权虽然将由首席部长和立法议会推选出的内阁控制，也是带有保留条件。而且“宪法”明文规定，“立法议会通过的法案非经总督同意不得成为法律”。首席部长和其他部长都要由总督任命，而总督又有权可以随时免除首席部长的职务。
    就是这样一个装璜门面的“宪法建议”，英国还要在它“确信塞浦路斯的确存在着可以在不受‘暴力’和‘恫吓’的影响的情况下举行真正选举的局势以后”，也就是在英国确立了它在塞浦路斯的殖民秩序之后，才来实行。
    显然，英国殖民主义者提出这样一个“宪法建议”来，目的只是想借这种欺骗活动缓和塞浦路斯人民的反殖民斗争并抵挡国际舆论的压力，以便继续维持它在塞浦路斯的殖民统治。
    但是塞浦路斯人民既不屈服于暴力的镇压，也不受政治骗术的欺蒙。他们坚持了争取民族自决权利的斗争。埃及和其他中东国家人民反对殖民主义斗争的胜利鼓舞了他们的斗争意志和决心。他们的事业得到维护正义和爱好和平的各国人民和政府的广泛同情和支持。在正在讨论塞浦路斯问题的联合国大会政治委员会上，就有许多国家的代表支持塞浦路斯人民对民族自决权利的要求，并认为联合国应该支持联合国宪章所承认的这种权利要求。
    至于那个欺骗性的“立宪”活动，从一开始就受到塞浦路斯人民的广泛抵制。许多组织、团体表示：他们要求自决，而不愿意同英国的“宪法专员”讨论所谓“宪法”问题。“为塞浦路斯而斗争”政治委员会发表声明说：“我们对这些建议所能表示的唯一反应是决心继续我们争取真正自由的斗争”。塞浦路斯人民用示威游行、罢工、罢市来回答英国殖民者的这个“立宪”阴谋。就在联合国大会政治委员会开始讨论塞浦路斯问题的那一天，2月18日，塞浦路斯各地人民又举行了一次反对英国殖民统治和要求民族自决的罢工罢市。希腊政府也正确地指出：英国的这个建议，是一个“政治讹诈的新试图，目的是想使自决的原则无法实现。”它拒绝同英国、土耳其讨论这个计划。它的代表在联合国里提出了一个要求联合国承认塞浦路斯人民自决权利的提案。
    每当事情关系到实际地满足殖民地人民的民族愿望时，高唱支持弱小民族独立要求的美国总是要露出它的狐狸尾巴来。在塞浦路斯的问题上，也像在阿尔及利亚、西伊里安等其他殖民地问题上一样，美国采取了行动来支持受到民族独立运动的严重威胁的殖民统治。美国国务院发言人怀特在英国提出上述欺骗性的“宪法建议”后评论说，这个计划“可以作为求得塞浦路斯问题的最终的和普遍能够接受的解决办法的第一步”。美国政府为了对希腊施加压力，要它改变态度，不久以前还决定削减对希腊经济援助50％。美国政府在塞浦路斯问题上对英国殖民者这种支持是有它自己的打算的。希腊的报纸指出：由于美国在近东的新政策，英美军队可能共同使用塞浦路斯。美国对塞浦路斯的计划是同所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”——美国干涉中东国家内政的企图相关的。还有消息说，美国国务院已经拟定了一个主张把塞浦路斯交给欧洲委员会“托管”五年、防务由北大西洋公约组织负责的计划。这说明，美国政府自己企图插足塞浦路斯，以美式的殖民统治来代替英国的老牌殖民统治，把塞浦路斯作为美国推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的一个战略基地。
    处在一个孤独的岛屿上，受到帝国主义殖民势力的联合压迫和残暴镇压，塞浦路斯人民的斗争是非常艰苦的。但是，今天世界各国人民反殖民主义斗争已经形成了一股不可抗拒的历史浪潮。帝国主义国家的殖民侵略政策已日益不得人心。英国想继续维持它在塞浦路斯的殖民统治地位是越来越困难了。无论是大炮或是关于“立宪”的欺骗手法，以及美国帝国主义者的别有居心的支持，都不可能挡住塞浦路斯人民的争取民族自决的浪潮。他们的民族自决要求一定要得到满足。
