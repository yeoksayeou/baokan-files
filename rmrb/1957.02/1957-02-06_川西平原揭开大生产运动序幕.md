    Chengdu, February 4th (By Our Newspaper) – The broad masses of peasants in Sichuan are welcoming spring in a surge of spring plowing preparations. Having just passed a joyous Spring Festival, they are immediately throwing themselves into this year's great production campaign with full enthusiasm.
    On the day of the Beginning of Spring, this reporter walked on the moist fields of the Sichuan Plain and saw tender green wheat and rapeseed everywhere. In some fields, the short-term crops that had been interplanted had just been harvested, and newly sown hemp and potatoes were already sprouting. Banners for the bumper harvest competition were erected along the fields, and rows of peasants were actively engaged in repairing canals, building embankments, applying additional fertilizer, weeding, and piling up manure along the roadsides. Those who remained in the villages were not idle either, busily repairing farm tools and weaving drying mats. Spring plowing preparations have vigorously unfolded in the rural areas of Sichuan.
    A responsible person from the Rural Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China told the reporter: This year, the province's peasants have thrown themselves into production after celebrating last year's bumper harvest and making ample preparations. Because 90% of the agricultural cooperatives increased production last year, and 83.5% of the cooperatives ensured that 90% of their members increased their income; because they summarized production experiences and rectified agricultural cooperatives; and because of large-scale publicity work and a series of top-down mobilizations, the phenomenon of ideological confusion among the peasants has been reversed. On the basis of the universally improved political enthusiasm and production initiative of the members, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province made preparations for spring plowing production from an ideological, material, and organizational standpoint long ago. In addition to raising more than 90,000 new-style plows, 200,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and a large amount of natural fertilizer, the province has also built many small-scale water conservancy projects and stored and regulated improved seeds. However, the supply of fertilizer is still insufficient in many places, and water conservancy work is also relatively slack. Therefore, it is necessary to provide in-depth and specific leadership and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses into this year's great production campaign.
    The reporter also visited Pi County on the Sichuan Plain. This county made meticulous arrangements for production a month ago. After repeated investigations and experiments, it determined the direction of increasing production by expanding the area of multiple cropping and formulated a plan to increase production by 14%. In order to welcome spring plowing, in addition to the county's peasants storing enough seeds and fertilizer and buying back more than 300 head of draft cattle, more than 110 cadres from county-level organs have gone deep into the townships and cooperatives to work for a long time and strengthen grassroots leadership. He Xing Township in this county established sixty bumper harvest creation groups and launched a field competition. Before the Beginning of Spring, the whole township accumulated 180,000 jin of fertilizer, repaired 420 ditches, planted more than 1,000 mu of hemp and potatoes, and topdressed rapeseed with fertilizer three or four times. The fields of the Red Light Cooperative were a scene of bumper harvest, with wheat and rapeseed growing vigorously and lovely; the crops of the twenty bumper harvest groups were particularly outstanding. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, the entire cooperative mobilized 1,200 people to water the fields, accumulate fertilizer, repair canals, and evenly replant seedlings.

### 川西平原揭开大生产运动序幕

    川西平原揭开大生产运动序幕
    本报成都4日电　四川广大农民在备耕热潮中迎接春天。他们刚度过欢乐的春节，立即情绪饱满地投入今年的大生产运动。
    立春这一天，记者走在川西平原湿润的田野上，到处都看见嫩绿的小麦和油菜。某些地里增种的短期作物刚刚收获，新播的麻和洋芋又吐出了芽叶。田畔上插着丰产竞赛的标牌，路边上活跃着修渠打埝、增施追肥、铲草堆粪的农民行列。留在村子里的人也没有闲着，正在忙碌地修补农具和编制晒垫。备耕活动在四川农村中已蓬勃展开。
    中共四川省委农村工作部负责人告诉记者：今年全省农民是在欢庆去年丰收和做好充分准备的情况下投入生产的。由于去年90％的农业社增加了生产，83.5％的社保证了90％的社员增加了收入；由于总结生产经验和整顿了农业社；由于大规模的宣传工作和自上而下一系列的动员，农民思想上一度混乱的现象已经扭转。全省的农业社在社员政治热情和生产积极性普遍提高的基础上，对春耕生产很早就从思想上物质上和组织上作了准备。全省除已筹集九万多件新式犁具，二十万吨磷肥、化学肥料和大批自然肥料外，还兴修了许多小型水利，储存和调剂了优良种籽。但是，目前不少地方肥料还感不足，水利工作也较松懈，因之必须深入具体领导，把群众的积极性和创造性组织到今年的大生产运动中来。
    记者又访问了川西平原上的郫县。这个县在一个月前就对生产作了周密安排，经过反复调查试验，确定了扩大复种面积的增产方向，制定了增产14％的计划。为了迎接春耕，除全县农民储备足够的种籽、肥料和买回三百多条耕牛外，县级机关已有一百一十多个干部深入乡社中长期工作，加强基层领导力量。这个县的合兴乡成立了六十个创造丰产小组，开展了田间竞赛。全乡在立春前积肥十八万斤，修水沟四百二十条，栽种麻、洋芋一千多亩，油菜普遍上了三四道追肥。红光社的田野里一片丰收景色，麦子、油菜茁壮可爱；二十个丰产小组的作物特别出色。立春这天，全社出动了一千二百人浇地、积肥、修渠和匀补禾苗。
