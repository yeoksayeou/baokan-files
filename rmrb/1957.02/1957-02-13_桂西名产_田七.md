    Guixi Specialty - "Tianqi"
    Zhang Xiaojie

    "Tianqi," one of the precious medicinal materials of Guangxi Province, is a major specialty of Jingxi County in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture. The planting area of "Tianqi" in Jingxi County in 1956 has expanded from 200 mu in 1955 to 2,000 mu; it is planned to develop to 5,000 mu this year, and to about 10,000 mu in 1958.

    "Tianqi" is a perennial plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is suitable for growing in moist, sandy soil, but it is afraid of drought, waterlogging, strong sunlight, and excessive shade.

    Its uses are to remove blood stasis and generate new blood, reduce swelling and relieve pain, stop bleeding, promote bone healing, and regenerate muscle tissue. It is a special medicine for treating internal and external injuries. Elderly and weak people can take it to replenish blood and keep warm; postpartum women can take it to quickly recover their health.

    The planting and management of "Tianqi" is relatively meticulous. According to the experience of ethnic minorities in this county in planting "Tianqi," generally, deep plowing and weeding are carried out in September and October. After four or five times of plowing and harrowing, the soil clods are crushed and then ridges are raised. (The ridges are two to three feet wide and five to six inches high), and the drainage ditches are about one foot wide. Then, a five-foot-high shed is built, and the top of the shed is covered with thatch. Sowing is done in late October. About one year after sowing, transplantation is carried out; the transplantation time is generally in November. "Tianqi" (underground roots) can be harvested three years after transplanting. If seed formation can be controlled, the quality of the underground roots harvested in the seventh or eighth year will be better. Generally, each mu can produce 70 to 80 jin, and some produce 120 jin. Last year, Ande District in Jingxi County alone earned 520,000 yuan from "Tianqi" production, which is equivalent to 69.2% of the total grain income, and each household of commune members received an average of 84.44 yuan.

    桂西名产——“田七”
    张效杰
    广西省名贵药材之一——“田七”，是桂西僮族自治州靖西县的主要特产。靖西县1956年“田七”的种植面积，已由1955年的二百亩扩大到二千亩；计划在今年发展到五千亩，在1958年将发展到一万亩左右。
    “田七”是属于草本五加科的多年生植物。适宜在湿润多砂的土壤上生长，怕干旱，也怕水浸，怕强烈的阳光，又怕太阴暗。
    它的用途是去瘀生新、消肿止痛、止血、接骨生肌，是治内外伤的特效药。年老体弱的人吃了有补血保暖的作用；产妇吃了能迅速恢复健康。
    “田七”的种植和管理是比较细致的。根据这个县少数民族种植“田七”的经验，一般在9、10月间进行深耕除草，经过四、五次犁耙，把土块耙碎后就起畦。（畦宽二至三尺、高五至六寸），排水沟宽一尺左右。然后搭五尺左右高的天棚，棚顶盖茅草。在10月下旬播种。播种后约过一年，即进行移植；移植时间一般在11月间。移植二年后即开花结实，第三年便可收获“田七”（地下根）。如能控制结籽，到第七、八年收获的地下根品质更好。每亩一般可产七、八十斤，有的产到一百二十斤。靖西县安德区去年仅产“田七”收入五十二万元，相当于粮食总收入的69.2％，每户社员平均分得八十四元四角。
