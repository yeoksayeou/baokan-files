    Cooperativization Brings Joy to the Spring Festival
    ——Visiting the First Agricultural Cooperative of Hehe Township, Xinxiang County, Henan
                Wang Changlong, Wang Dingbang
    One morning before the Spring Festival, after a snowfall, we arrived at the First Agricultural Cooperative of Hehe Township, Xinxiang County, Henan Province, trudging through the muddy, snowy roads. As soon as we entered the village, we heard the whirring of mills grinding flour everywhere. In the supply and marketing cooperative, male and female members were crowding around, selecting fabrics of various colors and various daily necessities. On the street, some members were carrying wheat in winnowing pans, some were carrying beans in baskets, and others were carrying corn in sacks, chatting and laughing as they gathered in a circle, waiting for the person in the middle to weigh each type of grain, record it, and then put it into other cloth bags according to the grain type. What was going on? After asking, we learned that it was the government's grain department, which, in order to allow farmers to have a good Spring Festival, allowed each person to exchange other grains for one and a half jin of rice. This agricultural cooperative was collecting the grain types from its members according to production teams in order to exchange for rice at the grain station in a unified manner. The supply and marketing cooperative had received many new floral fabrics, New Year's goods, etc., and had advanced the supply of cooking oil to the agricultural cooperative's members, so the customers seemed particularly crowded. The members said with joyful smiles, "This year we can celebrate the Spring Festival happily!"

    This cooperative was formed in January 1956 by 646 peasant households. Both the summer and autumn seasons were threatened by waterlogging, especially in the autumn, when 2,400 mu of grain, cotton, and sweet potatoes were submerged, of which more than 1,600 mu yielded no harvest. Even so, production still increased by 55.5% compared to 1955, which was not affected by disasters, and 91% of the members increased their income compared to 1955. The cooperative provided care and "five guarantees" to the few households that suffered reduced production, enabling them to maintain a general standard of living.

    Here, we will not introduce households with more labor and outstanding production increases, but will instead look at the Spring Festival life of households with less or no labor!

    Member Zhu Mingxi has a family of ten, with only two able-bodied laborers. In the past, they had difficulties every year and were in debt every year. After joining the elementary cooperative in 1955, their life was better than before, but they were still short of about 700 jin of grain. When joining the advanced cooperative in 1956, he knew that remuneration would be based on labor. He worried that he had little labor, so his share would be small, and he would not be able to support his family. Therefore, he did not allow his sixteen-year-old son and fourteen-year-old daughter to go to school, wanting them to do some light work in the cooperative. His family did a total of 669 workdays. At the end of the year, after deducting the distribution of more than 4,000 jin of grain, they also received 2,000 jin of turnips, 1,500 jin of cabbage, and more than 30 yuan in cash. The cooperative also had a deposit of 88 yuan. In this way, the whole family was especially energetic in managing the household and production. In order not to burden people with making clothes for the children after the start of spring, they sold the cabbage they could not eat for 60 yuan, and also sold two of their trees for more than 50 yuan. With 125 yuan, they bought a sewing machine to make clothes for the children. When we visited his home, he had already sewn three pieces of clothing for the children to wear during the Spring Festival and was planning to make two more. For the Spring Festival, his family ground one dan of wheat and exchanged it for 15 jin of rice. He also raised a fat pig, and had already discussed with his neighbors to slaughter it during the Spring Festival and divide it among several families. Zhu Mingxi said happily, "For the Spring Festival, we have white flour, rice, meat, vegetables, and new clothes for the children. To be honest, this is all thanks to the cooperative. I was wrong in the spring. I shouldn't have stopped the children from going to school. After the Spring Festival, I will let them go back to school."

    Member Qi Xiulan is a woman with bound feet. Her husband passed away, and she is raising three children on her own. The eldest daughter is seventeen years old, the second daughter is eight years old, and the youngest is only five years old. She and her eldest daughter did a total of 338 workdays. After deducting the distribution of 1,480 jin of grain, they also received 800 jin of turnips, 600 jin of cabbage, 11 yuan in cash, and the cooperative still had a deposit of 56 yuan. We asked them how they would celebrate the Spring Festival. Her eldest daughter said, "This year is so good! My sister and I each sewed a new cloth shirt, ground four dou of wheat. The government is so afraid that people won't have a good time that they took special care to exchange it for rice. We exchanged six jin of it, and plan to buy some vermicelli and cut two jin of beef, and that's complete..." Then she said, "We have a little more dividends in the advanced cooperative this year, but we don't want to spend it all. Isn't the government calling for thrift! Saving a little will be good for renovating our house."

    Zhang Xushi, a "five guarantees" household, is seventy-two years old, and she lives alone. During the land reform, she was allocated two houses and one mu and eight fen of land. Because she had no labor, she often lacked food and clothing. After the advanced cooperative was built, she had a reliable support. The cooperative provides her with 30 jin of grain and one yuan of pocket money every month, so she has nothing to worry about. This year, for the Spring Festival, she used the money she earned from spinning cotton for others, plus the two yuan she had saved from the cooperative, to sew a new cloth shirt, grind one dou and two sheng of wheat, and exchange it for three jin of rice. The cooperative distributed 200 jin of turnips and 100 jin of cabbage. She said, sitting on the coal stove, "I never had a coal fire in my house in the past. This year, I started a coal fire in October. If the advanced cooperative hadn't been built, how could I have lived such a life!" She is very concerned about the cooperative. Whenever there is work she can do, she goes to do it. A few days ago, she heard that the cooperative wanted to weave cloth bags. She went to the cooperative and asked to spin thread, and took back four jin of cotton to spin.

    When the members of the First Agricultural Cooperative of Hehe Township are happily preparing to celebrate the Spring Festival, they all look back on the superiority of the advanced cooperative, talk about the importance of doing a good job in production, and also miss the soldiers who are far away on the frontier, defending socialist construction. Based on the opinions of the members, the management committee decided to slaughter six fat pigs raised by the cooperative itself and send gifts to military families during the Spring Festival to express their condolences.

    合作化带来了春节的欢乐
    ——访河南新乡县合河乡第一农业社
                王昌隆　王定邦
    春节前，刚下过雪的一天上午，我们踏着积雪的泥泞道路，到了河南省新乡县合河乡第一农业社。一进村就到处听见呼噜呼噜的磨面声音；供销社里，男女社员们拥挤着选购各色布匹和各种生活用品；街上有的社员用簸箕托着小麦，有的用篮子提着豆子，还有的用口袋背着玉米，说笑着集中起来围成个圆圈，等候着中间的人一秤一秤的称过，记了账，分别粮食种类装进别的布袋里。这是怎么回事？问过后我们才知道，是政府的粮食部门，为了使农民过好春节，允许每口人用别的粮种调换大米一斤半。这个农业社正按生产队收集着社员们要调换大米的粮种，以便统一到粮站调换。供销社新进了很多新鲜花布、年货等，并提前供应农业社社员们的食油，所以顾客显得特别拥挤。社员们喜笑颜开地说：“今年可要欢欢喜喜过个春节啦！”
    这个社是在1956年元月由六百四十六户农民组成的。夏秋两季都遭到涝灾的威胁，特别是秋季粮棉薯类等有二千四百亩被积水淹没，其中有一千六百多亩未见收成。就这样，还比没有灾害的1955年增产55.5％，有91％的社员比1955年增加了收入；社里对少数减产户分别进行了照顾和五保，使他们能保持一般的生活水平。
    这里我们不介绍劳力多、增产突出的户，只就劳力不多和没劳力的户，来看看他们的春节生活吧！
    社员朱明喜，全家十口人，只有两个整劳力。过去年年困难，年年负债。1955年加入了初级社以后，生活比过去好了些，但还缺粮七百来斤。1956年参加高级社时，他知道要按劳取酬，自己顾虑劳动力少，分红少，会更顾不住家庭生活，于是就不让十六岁的儿子和十四岁的女儿上学了，要叫他们在社里做些轻活。他家里共做了六百六十九个劳动日，年终决算时，除净分粮食四千多斤以外，还分了萝卜二千斤，白菜一千五百斤，现款三十多元，社里还存着八十八元。这样，一家人治家和生产格外有精神。为着开春后不因给孩子们做衣服累住人，把吃不了的白菜卖了六十元，又卖了自己的两棵树五十多元，用一百二十五元买了一架缝纫机，准备给孩子们做衣服。我们去他家访问时，已经给孩子们缝了三件过春节穿的衣服，准备还做两件。过春节，他家里磨了一石小麦，换了十五斤大米，自己还养着一头肥猪，已经和邻居们商议好，春节把它杀了几家分开吃。朱明喜高兴地说：“过春节有白面、有大米、有肉、有菜、有小孩们穿的新衣服，说真话，这都是合作社给带来的喜欢。春天我打算错了，不该不让孩子们上学，过了春节还叫他们上学去吧。”
    社员齐秀兰，是个小脚妇女，丈夫去世了，自己抚养着三个孩子，大女儿十七岁，二女儿八岁，小的才五岁。他和大女儿共做了三百三十八个劳动日，除净分粮食一千四百八十斤以外，还分了萝卜八百斤，白菜六百斤，现款十一元，社里还存着五十六元。我们问她们怎么过春节，她的大女儿说：“今年可好啊！我和妹妹一人缝了一件新布衫，磨了四斗小麦，政府光怕人们过不好，又照顾叫换大米，俺换了六斤，准备再买些粉，割二斤牛肉就具全了。……”接着她又说：“俺今年在高级社里分红宽裕了些，可是也不愿意花透底，政府不是在号召节约吗！节省点好翻盖一下俺这座房子。”
    五保户张徐氏，七十二岁，就她一人。土地改革时，分给她两间房子，一亩八分地，因没劳力，成年少吃缺穿。高级社建成后，她有了依靠，每月社里供给她三十斤粮食，还有一元零花钱，啥也不愁了。今年过春节，她以自己给别人纺棉花赚的钱，连上积存社里给她没有花完的二元钱，缝了一件新布衫，磨了一斗二升小麦，换了三斤大米。社里分得二百斤萝卜、一百斤白菜。她坐在煤火台上说：“过去我房里从来没生过煤火，今年交上十月我就生了煤火。不是建成高级社，我哪能过这样的日子！”她对社很关心，社里一有她能做的活，她就去干。前几天她听说社里要织布袋，自己到社里要求纺线，领回四斤棉花正在纺。
    合河乡第一农业社的社员们，在欢欢乐乐准备过春节的时候，都追述到高级社的优越性，谈到搞好生产的重要，也怀念着远在边疆保卫社会主义建设的战士们。管理委员会根据社员们的意见，决定杀社里自养的六条肥猪，春节给军属送礼慰问。
