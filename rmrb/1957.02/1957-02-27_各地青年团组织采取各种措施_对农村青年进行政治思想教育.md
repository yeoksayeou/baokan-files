Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd - Youth League organizations in many parts of the country have recently taken various measures to strengthen ideological education for rural youth.

The Youth League organizations in Zhejiang, Anhui, Qinghai, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces have recently held propaganda work conferences to discuss how to further strengthen political and ideological education for rural youth. The Youth League organizations in Hebei, Liaoning, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guizhou, and eleven other provinces and autonomous regions have also recently issued instructions on conducting political education for rural youth. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Youth League, in its "Instructions on Strengthening Rural Propaganda and Education Work" issued in mid-January, particularly emphasized the need to foster among youth the idea of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and regarding the cooperative as their home, in order to encourage youth to build a new socialist countryside with full confidence. The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Youth League is currently conducting communist morality education for rural youth throughout the province in conjunction with cooperative rectification and spring plowing preparations. This activity has now been launched in more than 30 counties across the province.

From last year to the present, the Youth League organizations in nine provinces and autonomous regions, including Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Anhui, and Xinjiang, have successively launched the "Be an Excellent Cooperative Member" campaign to conduct cooperative love education for the vast number of young people. In some places, the League organizations also helped League members and activists to formulate action plans to strive to be excellent cooperative members, and set up "Glory Books" and "Merit Books" to commend young outstanding cooperative members. In Jiangxi Province, after the education of outstanding cooperative members, 270,000 young outstanding cooperative members emerged last year. In Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, 97% of the young people have been educated as outstanding cooperative members, and 4,679 young people have become excellent cooperative members.

Since the beginning of this year, League organizations in various places have also generally conducted education on revolutionary traditions for rural youth. After the West Zhang Geng Township in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, carried out education on the deeds of the revolutionary hero Liu Hulan for the young people, it greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the young people in the township for production. Many young people not only overfulfilled the fertilizer accumulation plan of the agricultural cooperative, but also completed a five-mile-long "Liu Hulan Canal" ahead of schedule. Recently, the Youth League organizations at all levels in Guangdong Province invited old people and old soldiers who participated in the revolution early to tell the young people about the deeds of revolutionary struggle, and organized young people to visit the families of revolutionary martyrs, visit revolutionary historical sites, ruins, and showrooms, hold "Revolutionary History Picture Exhibitions," and assist relevant units in organizing film projection teams to show revolutionary struggle films in rural areas, and carry out a variety of educational activities. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Youth League is currently compiling the life stories of heroic figures such as Zhao Yiman, Huang Jiguang, and Ding Youjun, in order to organize learning among young people throughout the province.

In carrying out the above-mentioned educational activities, all localities have paid attention to strengthening the education of relevant basic knowledge of the League. In Wuhu Prefecture, Anhui Province, 70% of the League branches in some counties have restored and established the League lesson system. According to statistics from 47 counties in Zhejiang Province, there are 983 townships that regularly adhere to League lessons. Many places have formulated League lesson education plans, compiled popular teaching materials in light of the ideological situation of local young people, and trained League lesson teachers and exchanged work experience. According to statistics from 26 counties in Jiangsu Province, 7,530 League lesson teachers have been trained recently.

    各地青年团组织采取各种措施 
    对农村青年进行政治思想教育
    新华社23日讯　全国许多地方的青年团组织最近积极采取各种措施，加强对农村青年进行思想教育。
    浙江、安徽、青海、广西、黑龙江、吉林六个省的青年团组织最近先后召开了宣传工作会议讨论如何进一步加强对农村青年进行政治思想教育的问题。河北、辽宁、四川、江苏、贵州等十一个省和自治区的青年团组织最近也先后发出了对农村青年进行政治教育的指示。青年团河北省委在1月中旬发出的“关于加强农村宣传教育工作的指示”中，特别强调要在青年中树立勤俭办社和以社为家的思想，以鼓舞青年信心百倍地建设社会主义的新农村。青年团辽宁省委目前正在结合整社、备耕工作，对全省农村青年进行共产主义道德教育，现在全省已有三十多个县开展了这一活动。
    从去年到现在，陕西、江苏、江西、山西、安徽、新疆等九个省和自治区的青年团组织都陆续开展了“做一个优秀社员”的活动，向广大青年进行爱社教育。有些地方的团组织还帮助团员和青年积极分子订立争取做优秀社员的行动计划，并设立“光荣簿”、“立功簿”，表扬青年优秀社员。江西省经过优秀社员的教育后，去年就涌现出青年优秀社员二十七万人。山西省平顺县有97％的青年受到了优秀社员教育，有四千六百七十九个青年成为优秀社员。
    今年以来各地团组织还普遍向农村青年进行革命传统的教育。山西省解虞县西张耿乡向青年进行了革命英雄刘胡兰的事迹教育后，大大鼓舞了全乡青年的生产热情，许多青年不仅超额完成了农业社的积肥计划，还提前挖成了一条五里长的“刘胡兰水渠”。青年团广东省各级组织最近邀请很早参加革命的老人、老战士给青年讲革命斗争的事迹，并且组织青年访问革命先烈的家属，参观革命史迹、遗址、陈列室，举办“革命历史图片展览会”，协助有关单位组织电影放映队到乡村放映革命斗争影片，开展了多种多样的教育活动。青年团四川省委目前正在编写赵一曼、黄继光、丁佑君等英雄人物的生平事迹，以便在全省青年中组织学习。
    各地在开展以上的教育活动中，都注意加强有关团的基本知识的教育。安徽省芜湖专区有些县70％的团支部已恢复和建立了团课制度。据浙江省四十七个县的统计，经常坚持团课的有九百八十三个乡。不少地方都制订了团课教育计划，结合本地青年的思想情况编写了通俗教材，并且训练了团课教员，交流了工作经验。据江苏省二十六个县的统计，最近已经训练了团课教员七千五百三十人。
