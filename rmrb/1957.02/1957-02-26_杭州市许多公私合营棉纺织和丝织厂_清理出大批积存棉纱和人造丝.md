    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 25th: Public-private partnership cotton and silk factories under the Hangzhou Textile Industry Company cleared out over 2,000 bales of old yarn and 4,439 kilograms of factory silk and rayon from their warehouses in the three days from February 14th to 16th. After sorting, these yarns and silks can be used to weave more than 201,900 feet of cloth and 1,050 bolts of silk.
    These cotton yarns, factory silks, and rayons had been stockpiled before and after the public-private partnerships were established in the various factories. For example, when several small factories were merged during the economic restructuring of the Shuguang Cotton Weaving Factory, the surplus cotton yarn from each small factory was not used, and new material preparation plans were drawn up, resulting in the accumulation of more than 230 bales of cotton yarn.
    Currently, the factories plan to weave the cotton yarn, factory silk, and rayon cleared from the warehouses into various cotton fabrics and silks according to their different colors and specifications, partially solving the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply.

    杭州市许多公私合营棉纺织和丝织厂
    清理出大批积存棉纱和人造丝
    新华社杭州25日电　杭州市纺织工业公司所属各公私合营棉纺织、丝织工厂，在2月14日到16日三天中，从仓库中清理出旧纱二千多包、厂丝和人造丝四千四百三十九公斤。这些纱和丝经过整理后可以织布二十万零一千九百多尺、织绸一千零五十匹。
    这些棉纱和厂丝、人造丝都是在各工厂公私合营前后积压下来的。如曙光棉织厂在经济改组几个厂合并时，各小厂剩余的棉纱没有用，又编制了新的备料计划，因此积压了二百三十多包棉纱。
    现在，各厂准备根据不同的颜色和规格，将仓库里清理出来的棉纱、厂丝和人造丝分别织成各种棉布和绸缎，部分地解决了原料供应不足的困难。
