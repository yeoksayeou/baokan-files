Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 1st: At a mass rally in Moscow celebrating the friendship between the Soviet and Czechoslovak peoples, Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, said: The state visit to the Soviet Union by the Czechoslovak delegation and the results of the talks are of great international significance. The Soviet-Czechoslovak Joint Declaration shows that the friendly relations between the two countries have been further developed. The nature of this relationship not only conforms to the interests of the two countries but also to the interests of the entire socialist camp.

This mass rally was held on January 31st at the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow. More than 3,000 representatives from all walks of life in Moscow attended the rally.

In his speech, Voroshilov also said that anyone who has not been misled by imperialist propaganda understands that only the path of socialism can guarantee such rapid development of Czechoslovakia's economy and culture. The achievements of the Czechoslovak people on the road of building a new life are guaranteed by the correct line of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, which has achieved and continues to achieve victories due to its loyalty to proletarian internationalism and the banner of Marxism-Leninism.

Voroshilov pointed out that, disregarding the clearly expressed wishes of the masses, the imperialists are attempting to undermine national independence and enslave the people of the Middle and Near East. American billionaires are eager to drive their "friends," the British and French colonialists, out of the Middle and Near East and establish their own rule in the countries of this region. But the peoples of the East, rising up to defend their independent lives, resolutely oppose the new conspiracies to enslave them. The peoples of the East have always been able to find moral support from the peoples of the socialist camp. Now this camp is able to resist any conspiracy of reactionary forces and will certainly be able to defeat them.

Similarly, after the failure of the imperialists' conspiracy in Hungary, international reactionaries launched anti-Soviet propaganda, attempting to undermine the unity of socialist countries and their communist parties. Contrary to the expectations of the reactionaries, this event has made all socialist countries even more closely united and has further heightened their vigilance.

Czechoslovak President Antonín Zápotocký delivered a speech amidst warm applause. He expressed his extreme satisfaction with the very satisfactory results of the Soviet-Czechoslovak talks. He said that after the heroic Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, a completely new type of socialist relations of equality, non-interference, mutual respect, comprehensive cooperation, and fraternal assistance emerged between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. This is one of the decisive reasons why Czechoslovakia is able to keep pace with the most advanced countries in the world today.

Zápotocký said that without the closest cooperation with the Soviet Union, it would not have been possible for Czechoslovakia's economy to develop rapidly and comprehensively. He then listed materials on the successful development of mutually beneficial trade between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia over the past eight years, pointing out that the principle of fair world prices is maintained in the trade between the two countries. In solving problems related to the utilization of nuclear energy, Soviet assistance has enabled Czechoslovakia to successfully begin a new industrial and technological revolution and has enabled its scientific and technological circles to overcome the years of difficult and costly research work that would have been extremely expensive for a small country, and reach the highest level in this field. At the same time, thanks to the long-term and interest-free loans granted by the Soviet Union to develop the uranium mining industry, Czechoslovakia has become one of the most advanced countries in the world in the mining of uranium. The Czechoslovak people are widely using the Soviet Union's rich experience, combining it with progressive traditions and their own national experience.

In addition, representatives of workers, scientists, and students in Moscow also spoke at the meeting, all of whom extended their greetings to the fraternal Czechoslovak people.

    莫斯科举行庆祝苏捷友谊群众大会
    两国领导人指出苏捷会谈结果具有重大国际意义
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　在庆祝苏捷两国人民友谊群众大会上，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫说：捷克斯洛伐克代表团对苏联所作的国事访问和会谈结果具有重大的国际意义。苏捷联合宣言表明两国的友好关系已经有了进一步的发展。这种关系的性质，不但符合两国的利益，而且也符合整个社会主义阵营的利益。
    这个群众大会是1月31日在莫斯科大克里姆林宫举行的。莫斯科各界代表三千多人参加了大会。
    伏罗希洛夫在他的讲话中还说，只要是没有被帝国主义宣传迷惑的人都懂得，只有社会主义的道路才能保证捷克斯洛伐克的经济和文化能这样迅速发展。捷克斯洛伐克人民在新生活建设道路上的成就是以捷克斯洛伐克共产党的正确路线作为保证的，这个党由于忠于无产阶级的国际主义和马克思列宁主义的旗帜，过去和现在都取得胜利。
    伏罗希洛夫指出，帝国主义者不顾人民群众明白表示的意愿，正在企图破坏民族独立，奴役中近东各国人民。美国亿万富翁急于把自己的“朋友”、英法殖民主义者从中近东赶出去，并且在这一地区的国家中建立自己的统治。但是为保卫独立生活而奋起的东方各国人民坚决反对奴役他们的新阴谋。东方各国人民一向可以从社会主义阵营各国人民方面找到道义的支援。现在这个阵营已经能够抵抗反动势力的任何阴谋，并且一定能够把它们击破。
    同样，帝国主义者在匈牙利的阴谋失败以后，国际反动派展开了反苏宣传，企图破坏社会主义国家和它们的共产党的团结。与反动派的期望相反，这次事件使全体社会主义国家更加紧密地团结在一起，更加提高了它们的警惕性。
    捷克斯洛伐克总统萨波托斯基在热烈的欢呼声中发表了演说。他对苏捷会谈的非常圆满的结果表示极为高兴。他说，在英雄的苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克以后，捷苏两国之间就出现了完全新型的社会主义的平等、互不干涉、互相尊重、全面合作和兄弟援助的关系。这是使捷克斯洛伐克能够在今天同世界上最先进的国家并驾齐驱的决定性原因之一。
    萨波托斯基说，没有同苏联最紧密的合作，捷克斯洛伐克的经济就没有可能得到迅速和全面的发展。他接着列举了捷苏两国八年来顺利发展互利贸易的材料，他指出在苏捷两国的贸易中保持着公平的世界价格的原则。在解决同利用核子能有关的问题上，苏联的援助使捷克斯洛伐克胜利地开始新的工业技术革命，并且使它的科学技术界有可能在这一方面跨越困难的、对小国说来要花极大代价的研究工作的年代，而达到了最高的水平。同时，由于苏联给予长期的和无息的贷款来发展铀矿工业，捷克斯洛伐克在铀矿的开采方面已经成为世界最先进的国家之一。捷克斯洛伐克人民正在广泛利用苏联的丰富经验，把它同进步的传统和本民族经验结合起来。
    此外，莫斯科的工人、科学家和学生代表也在大会上讲了话，他们都向兄弟般的捷克斯洛伐克人民致意。（附图片）
