City water companies are an important sector supporting industrial production and are also a cause that directly concerns the lives and health of millions of people and specifically embodies service to the working people. Therefore, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, city water companies must also increase production and practice strict economy.

We believe that launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy in city water companies should begin from the following aspects:

I. Save electricity while ensuring safe operation and guaranteeing water volume and pressure. Electricity costs account for about one-third of the total cost of tap water. If we practice strict economy in this area, the economic effect will be significant. Some city water companies have adopted measures such as improving equipment performance, increasing equipment utilization, creating new equipment and instruments, strengthening reasonable scheduling, and implementing quota analysis for work groups, which have achieved good results. For example, the Shanghai Water Company created a "remote water pressure transmission instrument," which can accurately control and adjust water pressure, avoiding the phenomenon of blindly increasing pressure. This saves more than 7,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, which amounts to more than 2.5 million kilowatt-hours per year. Another example is the Shenyang Water Company, which improved certain equipment and saved more than 2.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in nine months of 1956 compared to the same period in 1955. Considering that the total annual electricity consumption of city water companies nationwide is about 300 million kilowatt-hours, if we can further reduce electricity consumption by an average of 5% to 10% on the basis of 1956, we can save 15 million to 30 million kilowatt-hours, which is equivalent to reducing costs by 2% to 3%. Water companies in various places have created many experiences in saving electricity. If these experiences can be well summarized and promoted, it is entirely possible to achieve this target.

II. Inspect and maintain pipelines and mobilize the masses to reduce the leakage rate. At present, there are approximately over 10,000 kilometers of tap water pipelines in cities across the country. Pipeline equipment generally accounts for 60% to 70% of the fixed assets of the entire city water company. In the past, although various measures have been taken in various places to inspect and maintain pipelines, the degree of leakage has been reduced to some extent. However, because most of China's water companies were built a long time ago and have been repeatedly destroyed by enemies; and the data on the pipeline network layout in some cities is incomplete, the pipeline direction is unknown, and the pipelines have been in disrepair for many years, the pipeline leakage situation is still very serious. At present, the average leakage rate of tap water in cities across the country accounts for about 10% of the total daily production volume. Based on a daily water supply of 2 million tons nationwide, 200,000 tons of tap water are leaked every day, and more than 73 million tons of water are lost every year. At an average selling price of one dime per ton of water, the country wastes 7 to 8 million yuan every year. In some newly built cities in the west, due to the large-pore soil, if a pipeline leak occurs, it is not only a waste of water, but it will also soak the soil and affect the firmness of the building foundation, and may even cause houses to collapse. In order to prevent pipeline leakage, first, detailed current situation surveys should be conducted in cities lacking complete pipeline layout data to clarify the situation. Second, we must comprehensively strengthen leakage detection and maintenance work, improve leak detection equipment, train maintenance technicians, and improve maintenance quality and efficiency. In 1953, the Nanjing Water Company adopted the method of comprehensive survey, regional leak detection, and universal maintenance, which achieved good results. Leakage consumption was reduced from 15.8% in 1953 to 7.5% in 1956. The relationship between tap water and people's lives is very close. To reduce tap water leakage, we must mobilize the masses. At present, the waste of water in daily life is quite serious, especially in government agencies, schools, factories, enterprises, and collective housing. For example, a toilet in a dormitory of a certain agency in Beijing had a problem and leaked a large amount of water, leaking 21 tons a day, which is equivalent to the daily water consumption of 400 people. Therefore, to reduce tap water leakage, we must strengthen publicity and education among tap water users, ask everyone to save water, and jointly protect tap water pipelines and meters. If a leak is found, contact the management department for repairs in a timely and proactive manner. If this work is viewed from the perspective of a single household, the savings may not be large, but if thousands of households can do this, the savings will be considerable.

III. Reduce the amount of water used for backwashing filters within the plant and increase output value. At present, the amount of water used for backwashing filters in water plants across the country ranges from 1.6% to 7%, which is still a large amount. If it is improved according to the specific situation and the amount of water used for backwashing is further reduced, the output value can be increased a lot, and the service coverage of tap water can be expanded.

IV. Based on social needs and the principles of economic rationality and technical feasibility, balance and improve existing equipment to increase production. According to preliminary statistics, the average daily water supply capacity of tap water equipment nationwide is more than 4 million tons, while the current average daily actual water supply is only more than 2 million tons. In addition, old water plants are scattered, equipment is incomplete, and there are still many weak links. Therefore, the potential of tap water equipment is still very large. For example, if the Tianjin Water Company balances equipment capacity on the existing basis and converts open-air rapid filters into two-way rapid filters, the output can be increased by 70% to 80% with an investment of only more than 3 million yuan. Chongqing City used only a small amount of money to replace the old filter material in the filters with a comprehensive filter material, which can greatly increase the filtration rate and increase the output. Some cities have taken various measures to remove scale from pipelines, increase water pressure, and increase water transmission capacity, thereby saving a large amount of pipeline project costs.

V. On the premise of improving product quality and ensuring project quality, vigorously save raw materials and various chemical agents. At present, there is a shortage of steel in the country, and various chemical agents are also in short supply. Therefore, we must take various measures on the premise of ensuring quality to save steel materials and chemical agents. The Tianjin Water Company uses local industrial by-product ferrous sulfate instead of alum as a coagulant, which reduces production costs without compromising water quality, and also adopts the method of intermediate chlorination to reduce the consumption rate of chemical agents. Water companies in Changchun, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and other cities are studying the use of bamboo pipes and glass pipes instead of cast iron to lay street branch pipes. If the experiment is successful, it will save a lot of steel and basic construction investment for the country. The Beijing Water Company collected about 13,000 meters of pipe materials that were discarded during maintenance and buried underground without being used due to changes in circumstances, which were used to lay new pipelines, saving more than 72,000 yuan. If other cities carefully check their resources, it is not difficult to find some wealth that can be used but has not been used.

VI. Mobilize the workers and masses to improve production technology, improve business management, and create and promote various advanced experiences. At present, some experience has been accumulated in the business management of city water companies, but in general, the management methods of local industries are still used, and a set of their own systems has not been formed. However, city water companies are local and service-oriented enterprises, which are not exactly the same as general local industries, and have their own characteristics in production, supply, and marketing. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate technical, planning, financial, and business management systems based on the specific circumstances of city water companies, comprehensively strengthen technical management and planning management, reduce non-production personnel, streamline institutions, and comprehensively implement economic accounting, which will help promote the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

    自来水企业也要增产节约
    李必兴　关松森　金昌厚
    城市自来水企业是配合工业生产的一个重要部门，也是直接关系着千百万人民生活和健康、具体体现为劳动人民服务的事业。因此，根据二中全会的精神，城市自来水企业也必须要增加生产，厉行节约。
    在城市自来水企业中开展增产节约运动，我们认为应该从以下几方面着手：
    一、在安全运转、保证水量水压的条件下，节约用电。在自来水的总成本中，电力费用约占三分之一。如果在这方面厉行节约，经济效果是很大的。有些城市的自来水企业采取了改善设备性能，提高设备利用率，创造新的设备和仪器，加强合理调度和实行班组定额分析等办法，收到了很好的效果。如上海市自来水公司由于创造了“远程水压传示仪”，就能够准确地控制和调整水压，避免了盲目加压的现象，每天就可以节省七千多度电，一年就可以节省二百五十多万度电。又如沈阳自来水公司改善了某种设备，在1956年九个月内，就比1955年同期节省了二百五十多万度电。以全国城市自来水企业每年用电量总共约为三亿多度计算，如果能在1956年的基础上再平均降低电耗5％到10％，就可以节省一千五百万到三千万度电，即等于降低成本2％到3％。各地自来水企业在节省用电方面都创造了不少经验，如能把这些经验很好地总结推广，是完全有可能达到这个指标的。
    二、检查维修管道和发动群众降低漏损率。目前，全国各城市自来水管道约计一万多公里。管道设备一般约占整个城市自来水企业固定资产的60％到70％。过去，虽然各地都采取了各种措施来检查和维修管道，使漏损程度有所降低，但由于我国绝大部分自来水企业建厂年代较久，并屡遭敌人破坏；有些城市的管网布置资料失散不全，管道走向不明，年久失修，因此管道漏水情况仍然十分严重。目前，全国各城市自来水的平均漏损率占总日生产量10％左右。以全国每天供水量为二百万吨计算，每天就要漏掉二十万吨自来水，一年就要漏失七千三百多万吨水。以每吨水平均售价一角计算，每年国家就要浪费七、八百万元。某些西部新建城市因系大孔性土壤，如果发生管道漏水，不仅仅是浪费了水，而且还会浸湿土质，影响建筑物基础的坚固，甚至会造成房屋倒塌的恶果。为了防止管道漏水，首先要在缺乏完整的管道布置资料的城市中，进行详细的现状调查，弄清家底。其次是全面加强检漏维修工作，改进听漏设备，培养检修技术工人，提高检修质量和效率。南京市自来水公司1953年曾采取全面普查、分区检漏、普遍维修的办法，收到很好效果，漏耗从1953年的15.8％降低到1956年的7.5％。自来水与人民生活的关系非常密切。要降低自来水漏损，必须要把群众发动起来。目前，在生活用水方面的浪费是相当严重的，特别是机关、学校、工厂企业和集体住宅。如北京某一机关宿舍的一个恭桶出了毛病大量漏水，一天就漏掉二十一吨，相当于四百人一天的用水量。因此，要降低自来水的漏损，必须在自来水用户中加强宣传教育，要大家节约用水，并共同爱护自来水管道和仪表，发现漏水，及时主动与管理部门联系检修。这项工作，如果单从一家一户来看，节约价值也许并不算大，但是如果成千上万的用户都能这样做，那么节约的价值就相当可观。
    三、降低厂内冲洗滤池用水量，增加产值。目前，全国各水厂用于冲洗滤池的水量从1.6％到7％，数量还很大。如果根据具体情况加以改善，进一步降低冲洗用水量，产值可以增加很多，而且可以扩大自来水的服务面。
    四、根据社会需要，经济上合理、技术上可能的原则，平衡和改善现有设备，增加生产。根据初步统计，目前全国自来水设备能力平均每日可供水四百多万吨，而现在每日实际平均供水量只有二百多万吨。另外，旧水厂建设分散，设备不齐，还有许多薄弱环节。因此，自来水设备的潜力还是很大的。如天津自来水公司，如果在现有基础上平衡设备能力，把露天快滤池改建成双向快滤池，只要三百多万元的投资，产量就可提高70％到80％。重庆市只用很少的费用，把滤池中旧的滤料改为综合滤料，就可以大大提高滤速，增加产量。有些城市采取各种办法清除管道积垢，提高了水压，增加了输水能力，从而节省了大笔管道工程费用。
    五、在提高产品质量和保证工程质量的前提下，大力节约原材料和各种药剂。目前，国家钢铁不足，各种药剂也供不应求。因此，必须在保证质量的前提下采取各种措施，节约钢铁材料和药剂。天津自来水公司利用当地工业副产品硫酸亚铁代替明矾作混凝剂，在无损水质的条件下降低了生产成本，又采取中途加氯的办法，降低了药剂的消耗率。长春、福州、宁波等市自来水公司正在研究用竹管、玻璃管代替铸铁铺修街坊支管，如果试验成功，将为国家节约大量钢铁和基本建设投资。北京市自来水公司搜集了在检修时扔掉的和因情况变化而埋在地下没有利用的管材约有一万三千多公尺，用来铺修新管道，节省了七万二千多元。其他城市如果仔细清查一下家底，也不难找出若干可以利用而没有利用的财富。
    六、发动职工群众改进生产技术，改进经营管理，创造与推广各种先进经验。目前，在城市自来水企业经营管理方面已经积累了一些经验，但是一般的还是采用地方工业的管理办法，没有形成自己的一套制度。而城市自来水企业是地方性和服务性的企业，与一般的地方工业不尽相同，在生产、供销等方面都有它的特点。因此，需要根据城市自来水企业的具体情况，拟定技术、计划、财务和营业管理的制度，全面加强技术管理与计划管理，减少非生产人员，紧缩机构，全面实行经济核算，才能有助于增产节约运动的开展。
