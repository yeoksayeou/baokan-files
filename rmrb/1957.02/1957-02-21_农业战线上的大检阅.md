A Grand Review on the Agricultural Front

The National Agricultural Exhibition has opened in Beijing. This is the first large-scale national agricultural exhibition in our country. It comprehensively displays products from all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries from across the country, recording the creative achievements on the agricultural front. People can see from this exhibition how rich our country's agricultural resources are, and what tremendous achievements have been made in our agricultural production and related water conservancy and other construction undertakings since liberation.

This year is the final year of our country's First Five-Year Plan. Striving for a bumper harvest this year is an important key to the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the smooth start of the Second Five-Year Plan. Holding this exhibition at the time when the spring plowing season is approaching can, on the one hand, help the people of the whole country understand the state of our agricultural production, thereby paying more attention to and supporting agricultural production; at the same time, more importantly, it can help our agricultural workers and farmers absorb a lot of useful knowledge and experience. Currently, nearly a thousand national agricultural labor models are in Beijing to attend the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference; tens of thousands of rural work cadres will come to visit the agricultural exhibition. They will absorb rich knowledge and experience from here and bring it to the production and work in various places. This will be of great help in striving for a bumper harvest this year.

Many exhibits at the National Agricultural Exhibition show that our agricultural production has great potential. The yield per unit area of various major crops has increased. Taking rice, a high-yield crop, as an example, high-yield models have emerged in various provinces from east to west and from south to north. Not only have Guangdong and Fujian in the rice-producing areas had counties with double-cropping rice yielding over a thousand catties; Yunnan, Guizhou in the southwest and Liaoning, Jilin in the northeast also have large areas of high-yield land yielding over seven or eight hundred catties per mu. The production of miscellaneous grains such as corn, sorghum, and millet also has high-yield models of over a thousand catties in many areas; and there are examples of large-scale corn production with yields of over seven hundred catties per mu. There are also many examples of sweet potatoes yielding ten thousand catties per mu in various places. Wheat and soybeans, which have always been regarded as low-yield crops, have also achieved high yields. In 1956, wheat production achieved rapid growth. For example, in Wugong, Chang'an, and other nine counties (cities) in Shaanxi Province, the wheat yield per mu exceeded three hundred catties; Zhangye County in Gansu Province, with more than 300,000 mu of wheat, achieved a yield of 382 catties per mu, setting a new record for large-scale high-yield production in the country. In addition, there are many records of wheat yields of over a thousand catties per mu. For example, the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Linfen, Shanxi Province, had 1.97 mu of land with a yield of 1341.94 catties per mu. It is no longer rare for the average yield of soybeans to reach five hundred catties per mu over large areas. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) requires that the three types of regions in our country achieve yields of 400 catties, 500 catties, and 800 catties of grain per mu within twelve years, respectively. Now, Chao'an, Chaoyang, Puning, and Jieyang counties in Guangdong, Xiaogan and Huangpi counties in Hubei, and Longxi county in Fujian have all reached the target of 800 catties per mu. Huang County in Shandong has reached the target of 500 catties per mu. Chang'an County and Xianyang City in Shaanxi, Meng County in Henan, and Gaocheng and Zhengding in Hebei have all reached the target of 400 catties per mu. These facts show that the grain production targets proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) are possible to achieve. Cotton, the most important cash crop, has also seen large areas of high yields, just like rice, whether in the south, north, inland, or border areas. In 1956, the average yield of cotton in the country was more than 30 catties of ginned cotton per mu, of which 3 million mu of cotton fields yielded 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu. Other cash crops, such as oilseeds, have also achieved yields that are one to several times higher than the general yield. All these prove that it is completely correct for our country to take increasing the yield per unit area as the main way to develop agricultural production at the present stage.

At present, some leading organs in some areas, because the production targets were set too high last year, and some shortcomings and errors occurred in production leadership, resulting in the failure to complete the original plan, have become somewhat discouraged, and this year they dare not put forward positive production increase targets to the farmers again. This is not right. The National Agricultural Exhibition will encourage people's confidence in moving forward. All localities should learn from each other's good experiences in achieving high yields, formulate active and reliable production increase plans in light of local conditions, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

The exhibits at the National Agricultural Exhibition tell people that the various technical reforms and production increase measures we have implemented in agricultural production in the past few years have been basically successful and the achievements have been tremendous. In 1956, the national grain production increased by 20 billion catties, of which more than 10 billion catties were obtained due to the reform of the cropping system, such as increasing the multiple cropping index, changing dry land to paddy fields, and changing low-yield crops to high-yield crops. Last year, Zhejiang Province concentrated its efforts on changing single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice and intercropping rice to continuous cropping rice, with continuous cropping rice accounting for 25% of the paddy field area. Due to such a huge reform, although the province suffered severe natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, and droughts last year, with drought-stricken and waterlogged areas accounting for more than one-third of the cultivated land area, grain production still increased compared with 1955. We should face up to some shortcomings and errors that have occurred in some places in reforming the cropping system and promoting various new agricultural technologies; we must not fundamentally deny the necessity of reform because of some shortcomings and errors. At present, it is not possible for our country to have more chemical fertilizers and tractors. The technical measures to increase agricultural production are mainly to build water conservancy projects, increase fertilizer application, improve soil, improve varieties, promote new agricultural tools, increase the multiple cropping index, improve farming methods, and so on. The National Agricultural Exhibition introduces the scientific achievements and typical experiences in the above aspects. All localities should actively promote these experiences in light of local conditions, so that the agricultural technology reform work this year can be done better and more effectively.

The exhibits at the exhibition show that the tremendous achievements in agricultural production in our country are inseparable from agricultural collectivization. In 1956, due to the basic realization of agricultural collectivization throughout the country, the various economic constructions in rural areas achieved rapid development. Within one year, the newly added irrigated area nationwide due to the construction of farmland water conservancy projects reached more than 150 million mu. This figure is equivalent to twice the total irrigated area expanded in the previous six years. This, in conjunction with the large-scale water conservancy projects built over the years, has played a great role in preventing or mitigating last year's floods and droughts and ensuring increased agricultural production. Last year, the country afforested more than 4.69 million hectares (autumn afforestation not yet included in the statistics), which is more than four times the afforestation area in the same period in 1955, and has now completed 113% of the Five-Year Plan task. The development of meteorological work, which is closely related to agricultural production, has also been rapid. In 1956, the number of newly established meteorological observatories and stations across the country was close to the total number of observatories and stations built from 1949 to 1955. Without the foundation of collectivization, it would be impossible to promote various technical reforms and production increase measures in agricultural production on a large scale throughout the country. Without the realization of agricultural collectivization, the natural disasters in 1956 would have been difficult to overcome. It is especially noteworthy that large areas of high-yield crops mostly appeared in 1956. All this proves that the collectivization system has great superiority. At present, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural cooperatives across the country has accounted for more than 96% of the total number of peasant households in the country. As long as we work hard to consolidate and manage the agricultural cooperatives well, and strive for a bumper harvest this year and continue to expand the results of agricultural production, it is entirely possible.

We must spread the various successful experiences gathered by the National Agricultural Exhibition to every corner of the motherland, so that it becomes a force to encourage people to continue to move forward.

### 农业战线上的大检阅

    农业战线上的大检阅
    全国农业展览会在北京开幕了。这是我国第一次全国性的大规模的农业展览会。这里集中地展出了全国各地农业、林业、渔业、畜牧业等各方面的产品，记录了农业战线上的各种创造性的成就。人们可以从这个展览会看到我们祖国的农产资源是多么丰富，解放以来我国的农业生产以及同农业有关的水利等各方面的建设事业有了多么巨大的成就。
    今年是我国实施第一个五年计划的最后一年。争取今年的农业大丰收，是完满实现第一个五年计划和顺利开始第二个五年计划的重要关键。在今年春耕生产季节就要到来的时候举办这个展览会，一方面可以帮助全国人民了解我国农业生产的状况，从而更多地关心和支援农业生产；同时，更重要的是可以帮助我们的农业工作者和农民们吸取许多有益的知识和经验。现在，我国各地近一千个农业劳动模范正在北京参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议；几万个农村工作干部将要前来参观农业展览会。他们将从这里吸取丰富的知识和经验，带到各地的生产和工作中去。这对争取今年的大丰收会有很大的作用。
    全国农业展览会的许多展品说明，我国农业生产有巨大的潜在力。各种主要农作物的单位面积产量都有所提高。以高产作物水稻来说，全国从东到西，从南到北，各省都有了高额丰产的典型。不仅水稻产区的广东、福建有了双季稻的千斤县；西南的云南、贵州和东北的辽宁、吉林也都有了每亩七、八百斤以上的大面积高额丰产地。玉米、高粱、谷子等杂粮生产，在不少地区也都有了千斤以上的丰产典型；并且出现了亩产七百斤以上的玉米大面积丰产例子。甘薯亩产万斤的例子，各地也有不少。一向被看作低产作物的小麦、大豆，也出现了高额产量。1956年小麦产量获得迅速的增长。如陕西省武功、长安等九个县（市），小麦每亩产量超过三百斤；甘肃张掖县全县三十多万亩小麦，亩产三百八十二斤，创造了全国大面积丰产新纪录。另外，还出现了不少小麦亩产千斤的纪录。如山西临汾红星农业社有一亩九分七厘地，亩产一千三百四十一点九四斤。大豆大面积平均亩产五百斤的已经不是稀罕的事了。全国农业发展纲要（草案）要求我国三类地区在十二年内分别达到亩产四百斤、五百斤、八百斤粮食。现在广东的潮安、潮阳、普宁、揭阳等四个县，湖北的孝感、黄陂两个县和福建的龙溪县都已经达到了亩产八百斤的指标。山东的黄县达到了亩产五百斤的指标。陕西的长安县、咸阳市，河南的孟县，河北的藁城、正定都已经达到了亩产四百斤的指标。这些事实说明，全国农业发展纲要（草案）提出的粮食生产指标是可能争取实现的。经济作物中最主要的是棉花，它也和水稻一样，无论在南方、北方、内地、边疆，都出现了大面积高额产量。1956年全国棉花产量平均亩产皮棉三十多斤，其中有三百万亩棉田亩产皮棉达一百斤。其他如油料等经济作物，也出现了超过一般产量一倍至数倍的高额产量。这些都证明，我国以提高单位面积产量为现阶段发展农业生产的主要途径，是完全正确的。
    目前有一部分地区的领导机关，因为去年生产指标订得偏高，生产领导上发生过某些缺点和错误，结果没有完成原定计划，因此就有些泄气，今年就不敢再向农民提出积极的增产指标。这是不对的。全国农业展览会将鼓舞人们前进的信心。各地应当互相吸取好的丰产经验，因地制宜地制定出积极可靠的增产计划，争取今年农业的大丰收。
    全国农业展览会的展品告诉人们，几年来我们在农业生产上所实行的各种技术改革和增产措施，基本上是成功的，成绩是巨大的。1956年全国粮食增产二百亿斤，其中有一百多亿斤是由于增加复种指数、改旱地为水田、改低产作物为高产作物等耕作制度的改革而获得的。浙江省去年集中力量改单季稻为双季稻，改间作稻为连作稻，连作稻面积占水田面积25％。由于进行了这样巨大的改革，去年虽然遭受台风、水、旱等严重的自然灾害，全省受旱、受涝面积占耕地面积三分之一以上，但是粮食产量还比1955年有所增加。我们应当正视某些地方在改革耕作制度和推广各种农业新技术中所发生的一些缺点和错误；我们又决不能因为一些缺点和错误而根本否定改革的必要。我国目前还不可能有较多的化学肥料和拖拉机，增加农业生产的技术措施主要是兴修水利、增施肥料、改良土壤、改良品种、推广新式农具、提高复种指数、改进耕作方法等等。全国农业展览会对以上各方面的科学成就和典型经验都有介绍，各地应该因地制宜地、积极地推广这些经验，使今年的农业技术改革工作做得更好，更有成效。
    展览会的展品表明，我国农业生产上的巨大成就，是和农业合作化分不开的。1956年由于全国基本上实现了农业合作化，农村的各项经济建设获得了突飞猛进的发展。一年内全国由于兴修农田水利工程而新增的灌溉面积，达到一亿五千多万亩。这个数字相当于前六年扩大的灌溉面积的总数的二倍。这同历年修建的大型水利工程相配合，对于防止或减轻去年的水、旱灾害和保障农业增产有很大的作用。去年全国造林四百六十九万多公顷（秋季造林尚未统计在内），等于1955年同期造林面积的四倍多，现在已经完成了五年计划任务的113％。和农业生产有着密切关系的气象工作的发展也很快。1956年全国新建立的气象台、站接近于1949年到1955年所建台、站的总和。农业生产方面的各项技术改革和增产措施，如果没有合作化的基础，要在全国范围内大规模地推广是不可能的。如果没有实现农业合作化，1956年的自然灾害就将很难克服。尤其值得注意的是各种作物的大面积高额丰产，大多数出现在1956年。这一切都证明合作化制度有极大的优越性。目前全国参加农业合作社的农户已经占到全国总农户的96％以上。只要我们努力把农业社都巩固起来，并且办好，争取今年的大丰收和继续扩大农业生产的成果，是完全可能的。
    我们要把全国农业展览会集中起来的各种成功的经验传播到祖国的每一个角落，使它成为鼓舞人们继续前进的力量。
