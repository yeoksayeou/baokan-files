Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 17th: "Neues Deutschland" published on the 15th a reliable text of a secret letter written by Nelson A. Rockefeller, heir to the U.S.'s largest oil trust, Standard Oil, to U.S. President Eisenhower in January 1956. In this letter, the American oil billionaire offered advice to the U.S. President on establishing American domination over the world. He demanded that the independent countries of the world, as well as the colonies of the old colonial powers—Britain, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands—be placed under U.S. control.

Rockefeller criticized certain aspects of the U.S. government's foreign policy. He said that he did not underestimate the importance of the U.S. concluding military alliances, but he believed that establishing such alliances should be done in a way that was different from what the State Department had done in the past. Rockefeller said: "We cannot close our eyes to the fact that military alliances have become increasingly unpopular due to the aggressive diplomatic policy offensive launched by the Russians."

Military Alliances Suffer Serious Setbacks

Rockefeller said: "In the past two or three years, the policy of establishing military alliances has suffered serious setbacks. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is one example. Because the major Asian countries have refused to participate." At the same time, "it is difficult to convince the countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization that they would be willing to join Chiang Kai-shek, supported by the United States, in a war against Communist China. And this is clearly what the State Department is seeking."

Rockefeller pointed out that the Baghdad Pact was also the same, because most Arab countries did not participate, believing that it violated their national interests.

Rockefeller said that the establishment of these alliances had not in fact achieved the goals that the U.S. had hoped for in the Middle East or Southeast Asia. Rockefeller said, "I am not saying that these organizations are useless to us or should not have been established. I am not criticizing these treaties, but rather the methods used to establish these groups."

He said, "I am unwilling to use the famous paraphrase: 'What's good for Standard Oil is good for America,' but at the same time, I cannot ignore the fact that neither the Baghdad Pact nor the Southeast Asia Treaty has guaranteed us access to the valuable resources of the regions concerned, and they have not even guaranteed the security of these potentially important bridgeheads."

Rockefeller said that the achievements of the Soviet government leaders in visiting countries such as India, Burma, and Afghanistan last year "further highlighted the failure of the U.S.'s post-war Asian policy." He expressed "regret" that the U.S. government had not taken measures to offset this achievement.

"Trade First, Then the Flag"

Rockefeller suggested that U.S. foreign policy must be "global" and "comprehensive," including political, psychological, economic, and military aspects, as well as a special method of combining all of these.

He said that U.S. foreign policy had a "clever tradition" in the past, which was "trade first, then the flag," and the U.S. government should not ignore this tradition. Rockefeller said that the U.S. government had used this method in the past, for example, the U.S. used "various kinds of pressure" to establish NATO in Western Europe through the Marshall Plan. Another example is that through "economic assistance" to Iran, "we have opened the way to obtain Iranian oil and have gained a good foothold in that country's economy. The strengthening of our economic position in Iran has given us control over Iran's entire foreign policy. In particular, it has made it so that the King of Iran does not even dare to move, and his cabinet does not dare to move, without consulting our ambassador."

Rockefeller finally summarized his views on foreign policy into three points:

Military Alliances Are Still a "Magic Weapon"

(1) Continue to take measures aimed at establishing and strengthening military alliances, because these alliances are "potentially useful for preventing any communist aggression and preventing the outbreak of nationalism, and can consolidate the U.S.'s entire position in Asia and the Middle East." Rockefeller said, "We must not ignore the important fact that virtually all of our natural rubber, manganese, chromium, and tin, as well as a large proportion of our zinc, copper, oil, and more than one-third of our lead and aluminum, are obtained from abroad, mainly from the backward regions of Asia and Africa… A large proportion of our 'super-strategic materials' (uranium) are also like this."

Play a Long Game

(2) "In order to strengthen and, where possible, expand these alliances, we must formulate an economic development plan that is broad enough to give us such political and military influence in Asia, Africa, or other backward regions: equal to or greater than the influence we have achieved in Europe through the Marshall Plan." He said, "Therefore, our economic appropriations for backward countries should be channeled through those institutions established to serve military alliances. This will make these alliances more attractive. If necessary, some changes should be made to the form of these alliances. In other words, we should emphasize the economic aspects of our alliances whenever possible." He said, "We should make extensive and wise use of economic assistance to those countries we want to woo into joining us, but we should do this more skillfully and carefully than before. In the past, we often linked the provision of economic assistance to the requirement of joining this or that alliance of ours in a way that was so crude that it alienated many possible allies. It is necessary for us to act carefully and patiently, and in the initial stages, to limit ourselves to obtaining very modest political concessions as the price of economic assistance (in some special cases—we may even forego any concessions). But at a later stage, we will be able to put forward our political prices and our military demands." As for the policy towards Egypt, Rockefeller suggested that the U.S. provide this country with assistance to carry out some construction projects that exceed its own economic capabilities, so that it would have to rely on the U.S.

"The Hooked Fish Doesn't Need Bait"

(3) "The countries to which the U.S. is going to give economic assistance should be divided into three categories, and different methods and ways of economic cooperation should be applied to each category." Rockefeller said, "First, we should select those countries with anti-communist, but friendly governments, which are already linked to us through military agreements. In this regard, government subsidies and assistance can take the form of military appropriations. Because a hooked fish doesn't need bait." He said that the U.S.'s "economic assistance" to these countries should be "limited to what is necessary to enable these governments to continue to govern and to curb hostile opposition parties. In this regard, it is also necessary to control private capital, and the government should use and encourage private capitalists, so that they can help us achieve many political goals. In the long run, this private capital should enable us to eliminate or offset any disloyal opposition forces or forces that resist our policies, and increase economic pressure on any local business interests that are lukewarm or unwilling to support us, while strengthening economic support for those strata in the local business community who are prepared to cooperate with American personnel."

Subversive Activities in Neutral Countries

Rockefeller said that the second category includes those countries that are pursuing or tending to pursue a neutral policy. He said, "The development of our economic relations with these countries depends on us gaining a more critical position in the local economy. In neutral countries, we should support any tendency that seeks our help to implement vast economic plans that are actually beyond their capabilities (this is the case of Egypt mentioned above). By adopting this method, we can hope to guide the foreign policy of these countries in a more sensible direction." Rockefeller also said, "When encouraging private capital in these countries, we should support those parts or individuals who oppose the current regime."

Seize the Territory of Old Colonial Powers

Rockefeller said that the third category of countries includes the colonies of some old colonial powers. He said, "While taking measures aimed at encouraging private investment in these countries, we should also, in special circumstances and to an appropriate extent, support local entrepreneurs who are opposing their colonial status. In the initial stages, this assistance can take the form of establishing joint ventures. In supporting these elements, we should start from the fact that: "If we do not support them, we will lose all hope of using a restraining influence on them before we realize it is too late. If this happens, the desire for independence may eventually become such a strong nationalism that it is not only beyond the control of the old colonial powers, but also beyond our control."

Rockefeller finally asked the U.S. government to adopt his policies.

    石油大王洛克菲勒向艾森豪威尔献策
    暴露美国垄断资本妄想统治世界的野心
    新华社柏林17日电　“新德意志报”15日刊载了美国最大的石油托辣斯美孚油公司的继承人纳尔逊·阿·洛克菲勒在1956年1月写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封秘密信的可靠文本。这位美国石油亿万富翁在这封信中为了建立美国对全世界的统治向美国总统献策。他要求把全世界的独立国家以及老牌殖民国家——英国、法国、葡萄牙和荷兰的殖民地置于美国控制之下。
    洛克菲勒对美国政府的外交政策的某些方面进行了批评。他说，他并不是低估美国缔结军事同盟的重要性，但是他认为建立这种同盟应该采取同国务院过去所实行的有所不同的做法。洛克菲勒说：“我们不能够闭着眼睛看不到这个事实，就是由于俄国人发动的积极的外交政策攻势，军事联盟已经越来越不得人心”。
    军事联盟遭到严重挫折
    洛克菲勒说：“在过去两三年中，建立军事联盟的政策已经遭到了严重的挫折。东南亚条约就是一个例子。因为主要的亚洲国家都拒绝参加。”同时，“很难说得通，东南亚条约国家会愿意同美国支持的蒋介石一道，卷入对共产党中国的战争。而这一点显然正是国务院所企求的”。
    洛克菲勒指出，巴格达条约的情况也是这样，因为大多数阿拉伯国家都没有参加，它们认为这违反它们的民族利益。
    洛克菲勒说，建立这些联盟事实上并没有达到美国在中东或者东南亚所期望的目的。洛克菲勒说，“我这样说并不是说这些组织对于我们没有用，或者不应该建立。我不是批评这些条约，而是批评建立这些集团时所采用的方法。”
    他说，“我并不愿意使用有名的一句释意语：‘对美孚油公司是好的，对美国也就是好的’，但是，同时我也不能忽视这个事实，就是无论是巴格达条约还是东南亚条约都没有保证我们可以使用有关地区的有价值的资源，而且它们甚至没有保证这些潜在的重要桥头阵地的安全。”
    洛克菲勒说，苏联政府领导人去年访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗等国家的成就“更显出了美国战后亚洲政策的失败”。他对美国政府没有采取措施来抵消这种成就表示“遗憾”。
    “先贸易然后是军旗”
    洛克菲勒建议美国的外交政策必须是“全球的”和“全面的”，其中包括政治、心理、经济、军事以及把所有这些结合在一起的一种特殊方法。
    他说，美国的外交政策过去有一个“聪明的传统”，这就是“先贸易然后是军旗”，美国政府不应该漠视这个传统。洛克菲勒说，这个办法美国政府过去是使用的，例如美国利用“各式各样的压力”通过马歇尔计划在西欧建立了北大西洋公约组织。又例如通过对伊朗的“经济援助”，“我们已经打开了取得伊朗石油的道路，并且在那个国家的经济中很好地站稳住脚。我们在伊朗的经济地位的加强使我们取得了对伊朗整个外交政策的控制。特别是使它参加巴格达条约。”他说，“在目前，伊朗国王如果不跟我们大使商量就是连动一动，他的内阁都不敢。”
    洛克菲勒最后把他对外交政策的意见归纳为三点：
    军事联盟还是“法宝”
    （一）继续采取目的在于建立和加强军事联盟的措施，因为这些联盟对于“阻止任何共产党侵略和防止民族主义的爆发都是潜在地有用的，并且可以巩固美国在亚洲和中东的整个地位。”洛克菲勒说，“我们不要忽视这个重要事实，就是实际上我们全部的天然橡胶、锰、铬和锡，以及很大部分的锌、铜、石油和三分之一以上的铅、铝都是取自国外，主要是取自亚非的落后地区的……我们一大部分的“超战略物资”（铀矿）也是这样。”
    放长线，钓大鱼
    （二）“为了加强和在可能时扩大这些联盟，我们必须制定一个经济发展计划，这个计划的广泛程度应该足以使我们在亚、非或者其他落后地区拥有这样的政治和军事影响：等于或者大于我们在欧洲通过马歇尔计划所取得的影响。”他说，“因此，我们对落后国家的经济性拨款应该通过那些为了对军事联盟服务而设立的机构。这样就可以使这些联盟更有吸引力。如果必要时，对于这些联盟的形式应该作一些改变。换句话说，只要是可能的话，我们就应该着重我们的联盟的经济方面。”他说，“我们应该广泛地和明智地利用给予那些我们想要拉拢同我们联合的国家的经济援助，可是我们应该要比以前更加圆滑地和更加小心地作这件事。在过去，我们常常把提供经济援助同参加我们的这个或那个联盟的要求联在一起，方式是这么粗暴，疏远了许多可能的盟国。我们有必要细心地和耐心地行动，并且在最初阶段中，使我们限于获得非常适度的政治让步作为经济援助的代价（在某些特殊情况下——甚至可以不要任何让步）。可是在稍后一个时期，我们将可以提出我们的政治代价和我们的军事要求。”至于对埃及的政策，洛克菲勒建议美国对这个国家进行这种援助，使它进行一些超过它本身的经济能力的建设计划，这样就能使它不得不依靠美国。
    “上钩的鱼儿不需要香饵”
    （三）“应该把美国将要给予经济援助的那些国家分成三类，对于每一类将施用不同的经济合作的方法和方式。”洛克菲勒说，“首先，我们应该挑选那些反共的、但对我们友好的政府的国家，它们已经通过军事协定同我们连系在一起。在这方面，政府的补助和援助可以采取主要是军事拨款的方式。因为已经上钩的鱼儿不需要香饵。”他说，美国对这些国家的“经济援助”应该“只限于必需的，以便使这些有关的政府继续执政，并遏阻敌对的反对派。在这方面，还必须控制私人资本，政府应该利用和鼓励私人资本家，这样可以在他们的帮助下，达到许多政治目的。从长远说来，这种私人资本应该使我们能够消除或抵消任何不忠实的反对势力或者抗拒我们政策的势力，并对任何态度暖昧或者不愿支持我们的当地企业利益集团增加经济压力，同时对当地企业界中那些准备同美国人士合作的阶层加强经济支援。”
    在中立国家搞颠覆活动
    洛克菲勒说第二类包括那些正在奉行或倾向于奉行中立政策的国家。他说，“我们同这些国家经济关系的发展要依仗我们在当地经济中取得更多的关键地位。在中立国家中，我们要支持任何谋求我们的帮助来实施实际上超出可能范围的广大经济计划的倾向（这就是上面所说的埃及这种国家）。采取这种方法，我们可以希望使这些国家的对外政策向更加明智的方向发展。”洛克菲勒还说，“在鼓励这些国家内的私人资本时，应该支持那些反对目前政权的部分或个人。”
    夺取老牌殖民国家的地盘
    洛克菲勒说，第三类国家包括一些老牌的殖民国家的殖民地。他说，“在采取目的在于鼓励对这些国家进行私人投资的同时，还应该在特殊的情况下并且在适当的限度内支持当地正在进行反对其殖民地地位的实业家。在最初的阶段，这种援助可以采取建立联合企业的形式。在支持这些分子的时候，我们应该从这样一个事实出发：“要是我们不支持他们，我们就会在发觉太迟以前失去对他们使用抑制影响的一切希望。如果发生这种情况，争取独立的愿望就可能终于变成为十分强烈的民族主义，以致不仅不受老殖民国家的控制，而且不受我们的控制。”
    洛克菲勒最后要求美国政府接纳他的政策。
