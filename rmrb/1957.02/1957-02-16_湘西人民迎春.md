Xinhua News Agency, Jishou, February 13th: Jishou on the 11th and 12th (the 12th and 13th days of the first lunar month) was a city of laughter.

On the morning of the 11th, more than 30,000 Miao and Han people, dressed in festive attire, came from various mountain villages in the six counties of Fenghuang, Huayuan, Baojing, Guzhang, Jishou, and Luxi, treading on the snow, to Jishou City, where the People's Committee of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture is located, to welcome the Spring Festival. Welcoming the Spring Festival is a local custom, and after welcoming the Spring Festival, people will devote themselves to production with all their strength.

The lively scene of welcoming the Spring Festival is difficult to describe. The streets and squares were crowded with people. Amidst the sound of firecrackers, seventeen "Spring" platforms (decorated platforms) passed by, with dragon lanterns and lions following behind, dancing back and forth. On the eight-person swings loved by the Miao people, joyous songs reverberated. An old woman in her sixties from Sanchaping, Jishou, sat on a swing, joyfully competing in singing with others, singing a song for each revolution.

As night fell, beautiful Miao songs resounded everywhere on the mountainside of Yipuli and beside the square. Fireworks racks were lit in front of the Spring Festival celebration stage. With dazzling flashes and crackling firecrackers, beautiful pictures appeared. People saw five fireworks displays such as "Tractors Plowing the Land" and "Miao and Han Unity." By the time it was over, the night was already deep, and people still lingered in the square for a long time.

    湘西人民迎春
    新华社吉首13日电　11、12两天（农历正月12、13日）的吉首，是欢笑的城。
    11日这天的早晨，三万多苗族汉族人民，就穿着节日盛装从凤凰、花垣、保靖、古丈、吉首、泸溪等六县的各个山寨，踏着白雪来到湘西苗族自治州人民委员会所在地的吉首城迎春。迎春是当地人民的习惯，迎春后人们就要全力投入生产了。
    迎春的热闹景象是难以描绘的。街道上、广场上到处拥挤着人群。鞭炮声中，十七台“春”（采台）走过，龙灯、狮子跟在后面来回舞动。苗胞喜爱的八人秋千上，荡漾着欢乐的歌声。吉首三岔坪一个六十多岁的老婆婆坐在秋千上喜气洋洋地和别人赛歌，转一圈唱一个。
    夜幕垂临了，依铺里山头上广场边到处响起了美妙的苗歌声。迎春大会的台前燃起了焰火架。随着耀眼的闪光和辟拍的爆竹声，一幅幅美丽的图景出现了，人们看到了“拖拉机耕地”“苗汉团结”等五台焰火，在完结的时候，夜已很深，人们还久久地逗留在广场上。
