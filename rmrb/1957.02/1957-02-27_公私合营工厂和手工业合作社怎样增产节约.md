Since the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched, the vast number of workers in public-private joint factories and the vast number of members of handicraft cooperatives in various places have also actively taken action. However, at present, many public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives are facing difficulties in the supply of raw materials; a few industries are also facing difficulties in production tasks due to the reduction of national capital construction investment and public expenditures. Some people therefore believe that it is impossible to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives. This view is of course wrong. There is no doubt that public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives can also increase production and practice economy.

The production of both public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives increased to varying degrees last year compared with the previous year, and some even had significant increases. Due to the tight production tasks last year, some production units, although they trial-produced many new products, could not put them into production; some production units did not repair the machines and equipment that should have been repaired in time; and some production units had a tendency to emphasize quantity over quality and not pay attention to rational economy. In particular, the daily necessities such as furniture, clothing, shoes, and hats used by the general public were extremely inconvenient to repair last year, as there was nowhere to repair them. This year, the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy in public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives should be arranged according to these situations.

First of all, management should be strengthened, technology should be improved, quality should be improved, and economy should be increased in production. Among the various industries of public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives, the differences between advanced units and backward units are very large. In producing the same products, not only are the management costs high and low, but the materials used are often more or less. In the process of promoting backward units to catch up with advanced units, considerable potential can be tapped. Even advanced units can further save raw materials, reduce defect rates, and strengthen the control of material cutting to reduce costs, improve quality, and increase production. These all need to be achieved through strengthening management and improving technology. Some public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives in the hardware machinery and woodworking industries can also save some steel and wood and produce more products by reviewing drawings and reducing unnecessary bulkiness and cutting volume. Of course, changes in product design drawings should be very cautious, and it must be ensured that the products meet quality standards, and must be approved by the higher-level industrial management departments.

Some public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives with better technical conditions can, according to needs, trial-produce some new products that do not use much material and require a lot of labor. Last year, some knitting factories improved the structure, style, and pattern of knitted goods and trial-produced a batch of exquisite knitted sweaters and gloves and other products to supply the market, which were very popular among consumers. At present, many industries, such as public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives in the shoe and hat industries, should advocate meticulous workmanship and produce more durable and beautiful commodities to meet the needs of the masses.

Public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives in various places should also use the gaps in production to repair machines. Public-private joint machine factories and hardware production cooperatives that can do repair work should actively solicit repair tasks to solve the difficulties of insufficient production tasks. When allocating metal materials, priority should be given to the needs of repair. Daily necessities production units that can do repair work should also solicit some repair work in addition to producing finished products. Under the call for increasing production and practicing economy, fewer new furniture items are being bought than last year, and the repair of old furniture will increase. Many agencies and organizations have some incomplete furniture and appliances that need to be repaired in their storage rooms; residents also have a lot of furniture and appliances that urgently need to be repaired. In the sewing, shoe, and hat industries, there used to be jobs such as large to small alterations, old to new renovations, darning, and repairs, which should be maintained and promoted in the future. Repairing an old item uses much less raw material than manufacturing a new one, which is in line with the principle of economy. In order to meet the needs of repairing machines and daily necessities, the relevant public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives should appropriately change their labor organization and management methods. Each production point should do repair work as much as possible, not only accepting repair work from customers, but also appropriately increasing mobile repair teams to go out to work.

If many public-private joint factories and handicraft cooperatives can fully utilize waste materials for production, they can not only reduce the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, but also turn useless into useful, which is a great saving. In terms of labor, some regions can carry out appropriate allocation according to the characteristics of the off-season and peak season of each industry. Some employees of public-private joint factories and members of handicraft cooperatives come from nearby rural areas, and during the busy farming season, they can be allowed to take leave to go home to support agricultural production, in order to reduce the phenomenon of idle work.

When soliciting business and utilizing waste materials, each public-private joint factory and handicraft cooperative must pay attention to objective needs and possibilities, and not deviate from realistic conditions; and should not compete with brother factories and brother cooperatives for business or rush to purchase waste materials, so as not to affect unity and cause chaos. Local planning agencies and industrial and commercial management departments should strengthen the planned balance of supply, production, and sales, do a good job in the supply of raw materials and product sales, strengthen coordination and cooperation, and strive to reduce and avoid blindness.

In all production units, the quality of products must be resolutely guaranteed and improved. Only on the premise of ensuring and improving product quality can the campaign to increase production and practice economy be correctly carried out. When calculating the achievements of increasing production and practicing economy, we must not only look at indicators such as output or output value, but also see whether the product quality indicators have been completed. Units that have completed other indicators but have not completed product quality indicators cannot be regarded as having fully completed the task of increasing production and practicing economy. Because their increase in production and economy is at the cost of reducing quality, and reducing quality is the biggest waste. As for production units that have not yet established product quality standards, they should gradually formulate product quality standards, so that these standards are familiar to all employees or members, and gradually revised and supplemented in the production process.

The campaign to launch and adhere to increasing production and practicing economy must be carried out on the basis of ideological education of "running factories diligently and thriftily" and "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily." The Party, the Communist Youth League, the trade union, and administrative organizations must mobilize the vast number of employees of public-private joint factories and the vast number of members of handicraft cooperatives to actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    公私合营工厂和手工业合作社怎样增产节约
    自从全国性的增产节约运动开展以后，各地公私合营工厂的广大职工和手工业合作社的广大社员，也积极地行动起来了。可是，在目前，许多公私合营工厂和手工业合作社存在着原材料供应不足的困难；少数行业由于国家的基本建设投资和公用支出的减少，还存在着生产任务不足的困难。有的人因此就认为在公私合营工厂和手工业合作社中不能开展增产节约运动。这种看法当然不对。公私合营工厂和手工业合作社同样能够增产节约，这是毫无疑问的。
    公私合营工厂和手工业合作社，去年的生产都比前年有了不同程度的增长，有的还有了很大的增长。由于去年的生产任务紧张，有些生产单位虽然试制了不少新产品，也不能投入生产；有些生产单位应该检修的机器和设备，也没有及时检修；有些生产单位曾发生重量不重质和不注意合理节约的偏向。特别是广大居民日用的家具和衣服、鞋、帽等日用品，去年要修理的也无处修理，极为不便。今年应该根据这些情况来布置公私合营工厂和手工业合作社的增产节约任务。
    首先应该加强管理，改进技术，提高质量，节约增产。在公私合营工厂和手工业合作社的各行业当中，先进单位和落后单位之间的差别很大。生产同样的产品，不仅管理费用有高有低，用料也往往有多有少。在推动落后单位赶上先进单位的过程中，可以发掘不小的潜力。即使是先进的单位，也还可以进一步从减少原料损耗，减少废品率，加强掌握开料等方面节省原材料，降低成本，提高质量，增加产量。这些都是需要通过加强管理、改进技术才能做到的。有的五金机器和木器行业的公私合营工厂和手工业合作社，通过审查图纸，减少不必要的粗笨程度和切削量，也可以节省一些钢铁和木材，多生产一些产品。当然，改变产品设计图纸应当十分慎重，必须保证产品符合质量标准，同时要经过上级工业管理部门的批准。
    有些技术条件较好的公私合营工厂和手工业合作社，可以根据需要，试制一部分用料不多、费工较大的新产品。去年有些针织厂改进针织品的结构、式样和花色，试制了一批精美的线衣和手套等产品供应市场，很受消费者的欢迎。目前有许多行业，如鞋帽等行业的公私合营工厂和手工业合作社，都应该提倡精工细作，多生产一些耐用的美观的商品，以满足群众的需要。
    各地的公私合营工厂和手工业合作社，还应当利用生产的间隙，修配机器。公私合营机器厂和五金生产合作社中能做修配活的，应当主动地招揽修配的任务，以解决生产任务不足的困难。在分配金属材料的时候，应当尽先照顾修配的需要。可以做修理活的日用品生产单位，除了生产成品以外，也应该招揽一些修理活来做。在增产节约的号召下，买新家具的比去年少了，对旧家具的修理就会增加。不少机关、团体的储藏室都有一些残缺不全的家具和用具需要修理；居民也有很多家具和用具急待修理的。在缝纫、鞋帽等行业中，过去有大改小、旧翻新、织补、修整等活计，今后应当加以保持和发扬。修理一件旧东西比制造一件新的少用很多原材料，这就符合节约的原则。为了适应修理机器和日用品的需要，有关的公私合营工厂和手工业合作社应该适当地改变劳动组织和经营方式，各个生产点应该尽可能兼做修理活，不仅要承接顾客送上门的修理活，而且还可以适当增加流动修理小组，出门去做活。
    有不少的公私合营工厂和手工业合作社，如果能够充分利用废料来进行生产，那不仅可以减少原料不足的困难，而且可以化无用为有用，这是一个很大的节约。在劳动力方面，有些地区可以按照各个行业淡季和旺季的特点，进行适当的调配。有些公私合营工厂的职工和手工业合作社的社员来自附近的农村，在农忙季节，可以允许他们请假回家支援农业生产，以减少窝工的现象。
    各个公私合营工厂和手工业合作社在招揽业务和利用废料的时候，必须注意客观的需要和可能，不要脱离现实条件；也不要和兄弟厂、兄弟社去争揽业务，抢购废料，以免影响团结和造成混乱。各地计划机关和工、商管理部门，应当加强供、产、销的计划平衡工作，做好原材料供应和产品推销工作，加强协作配合，力求减少和避免盲目性。
    在所有的生产单位中，必须坚决保证和提高产品的质量。只有在保证和提高产品质量的前提下，才能正确地开展增产节约运动。在计算增产节约的成绩的时候，不能只看产量或产值等指标，还要看产品质量指标完成了没有。完成了其他指标而没有完成产品质量指标的单位，是不能算作全面完成了增产节约任务的。因为他们的增产和节约是以降低质量作代价的，而降低质量就是最大的浪费。至于还没有规定产品质量标准的生产单位，应当逐步制定产品质量标准，使这些标准为全体职工或社员所熟悉，并在生产过程中逐步地加以修正和补充。
    开展和坚持增产节约运动，必须在“勤俭办厂”、“勤俭办社”的思想教育基础上进行。党、团、工会和行政组织必须动员公私合营工厂的广大职工和手工业合作社的广大社员，积极地投入增产节约的运动中去。
