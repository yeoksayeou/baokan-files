Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 6th: A good atmosphere of filial piety to parents and respect for the elderly has emerged in Getiaogang Township, Changli County, Hebei Province.

The Party and Communist Youth League organizations in this township usually pay attention to educating young people in communist morality. Before last summer, some young people in the township were unwilling to support their parents and did not respect the elderly. The Party and League organizations used meetings, blackboards, and rooftop broadcasts to educate young people. Liu Yuanhe and Liu Yuanshan, two brothers, once wanted to push their parents to the agricultural cooperative as "Five Guarantees" households after the advanced cooperative was formed. Later, after education, they dispelled this idea and jointly used work points to support their parents. After education by the League cadres, Youth League member Xie Chunshen and his wife no longer disliked his mother for being old and only eating without being able to work. The township also held several small-scale forums, inviting young League members who had good relationships with their mothers-in-law and harmonious families to introduce their experiences. Women's Federation cadres also conducted home visits at the same time, mobilizing mothers-in-law to love their daughters-in-law and daughters-in-law to respect their parents-in-law. As a result, many harmonious and happy families have emerged throughout the township.

In the past, when some young people in the township were doing farm work, they rarely helped the elderly; when discussing issues at meetings, there was also a phenomenon that young people would interrupt the elderly as soon as they spoke. Now the situation is different. Whenever there is heavy work to be done, the young and strong lads rush to do it first, and the elderly only take on some light work. When researching any issues at meetings, young people are also willing to listen to the opinions of the elderly. Usually, young people always respectfully address the elderly as "Grandpa" and "Grandma".

### 昌黎县葛条港乡  青年孝父母敬老人

    昌黎县葛条港乡
    青年孝父母敬老人
    新华社保定6日电　河北省昌黎县葛条港乡出现孝顺父母、尊敬老人的良好风气。
    这个乡的党和青年团组织平时注意对青年进行共产主义道德的教育。去年夏天以前，乡里曾经有些年轻人不愿赡养父母，不尊敬老人。党和团的组织就利用开会、黑板报、屋顶广播等方式向青年进行教育。刘元和、刘元善兄弟两个，在高级合作化以后曾经想把父母推给农业社做“五保”户，后来经过教育，他们打消了这种想法，共同拿出工分赡养父母。经过团的干部教育后，青年团员谢春森和他的妻子也不再嫌母亲年老光吃不能劳动了。乡里还开过几次小型座谈会，邀请婆媳关系处理得好、家庭和睦的青年团员介绍经验。妇女联合会干部也同时进行家庭访问，动员婆婆们要爱媳妇、媳妇们要尊敬公婆。因此全乡出现了许多和睦美满的家庭。
    过去乡里有些青年干农活的时候，很少帮助老年人；开会讨论问题的时候，还有老年人一发言就被青年人顶回去的现象。现在情况不同了，遇到干什么重活，都是年轻力壮的小伙子们抢先，老年人只担负一些轻活。开会研究什么问题，年轻人也都愿听听老年人的意见。平时青年人对老年人讲话总是“大爷”、“大娘”地尊称着。
