Xinhua News Agency, February 21st dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower explained the U.S. policy on the issue of Israeli troop withdrawal in a televised broadcast on the 20th. He said that the United States believes that the conditions for Israel's withdrawal have actually been met in the United Nations resolutions and Dulles's memorandum of February 11. He said that the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on February 2nd had suggested that United Nations forces be stationed in the Gulf of Aqaba, and the U.S. memorandum also guaranteed "free navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba. At the same time, "the United States is also willing to urge and support the United Nations' participation in the administrative management of the Gaza Strip with Egypt's consent."

Eisenhower said that, however, Israel is "trying to get more" and insists on having "definite guarantees," otherwise it will refuse to withdraw its troops. He said that Israel's position has left the United States "deeply disappointed."

The American president then made the following statement: he cannot "allow American influence to help the view that a country that has invaded another country should be allowed to extort conditions for withdrawal."

Eisenhower pointed out that the question of what the United Nations should do next has arisen in the current situation. He said: "If the United Nations allows people to ignore its repeatedly made resolutions requiring the withdrawal of invading forces, then it will be admitting failure." "This could bring countless disasters to our friends and to our own country. This would make the realization of the goals I proposed in my Middle East Message to Congress on January 5 many times more difficult." Therefore, "the United Nations has no other way but to exert pressure on Israel to comply with the troop withdrawal resolution."

Eisenhower did not mention in his speech what kind of pressure the United States advocates that the United Nations should exert on Israel, nor did he indicate whether the United States supports the suggestions of some Asian and African countries to impose sanctions on Israel.

The American president's speech was delivered after he met with leaders of both parties in Congress. It is reported that leaders of both parties in Congress are opposed to imposing sanctions on Israel.

    企图从袒护侵略者的狼狈处境中脱身
    艾森豪威尔主张联合国迫使以色列撤军
    但仍坚持杜勒斯建议并避而不谈制裁问题
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔20日在电视广播演说中解释了美国在以色列撤军问题上的政策。他说，美国认为，在联合国的决议和杜勒斯2月11日的备忘录中，实际上已经满足了以色列的撤军条件。他说，联合国大会2月2日的决议曾经建议联合国部队进驻亚喀巴湾，美国的备忘录也保证亚喀巴湾的“自由通航”同时，“美国也很愿意敦促而且支持在埃及的同意下由联合国参加对加沙地带的行政管理”。
    艾森豪威尔说，但是，以色列“企图得到更多的东西”，坚持要有“肯定的保证”，否则就不肯撤军。他说，以色列的这种立场使美国“深感失望”。
    这位美国总统接着作了这样一种表示：他不能“让美国的影响去帮助那种认为应该允许一个侵略另一国的国家勒索撤退条件的主张”。
    艾森豪威尔指出，在目前情况下就发生了联合国下一步应该怎样做的问题。他说：“如果联合国容许人对它一再作出的要求撤退侵略军的决议置之不理，那么它将是承认失败”。“这可以给我们的朋友们，还给我们自己的国家，带来不可胜数的灾难。这会使得我在1月5日致国会的中东咨文中所提出的目标的实现不知要困难多少倍”。因此，“联合国除了对以色列行使压力，要它遵从撤军决议之外别无他法”。
    艾森豪威尔在演说里没有提到美国主张联合国对以色列施行什么样的压力，他也没有表明美国对一些亚非国家要求制裁以色列的建议是否支持。
    美国总统的这篇演说是在他和国会两党领袖会谈以后发表的。据报道，国会两党领袖都反对对以色列进行制裁。
