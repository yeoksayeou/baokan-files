Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st: Guizhou Province, famous for its abundant "Miao Fir" production, will increase timber production by 100,000 cubic meters this year to support national construction. It is estimated that the province's total timber production this year will reach more than 550,000 cubic meters.

"Miao Fir," also known as "Eighteen Fir," mostly grows in the Miao Mountains where the Miao and Dong ethnic minorities reside in southeastern Guizhou Province. This type of fir tree is tall and straight, with little difference in thickness between the root and the tip. What is particularly welcomed by basic construction units across the country is that ordinary fir wood often rots from the inside out, while although the surface of "Miao Fir" may decay, the heartwood remains as strong as ever, making it suitable for use as masts, pillars, beams, pilings, sleepers, and so on.

    贵州将增产“苗杉”
    据新华社贵阳21日电　以盛产“苗杉”出名的贵州省，今年将增产木材十万立方公尺，以支援国家建设。预计全省今年木材总产量将达到五十五万多立方公尺。
    “苗杉”又称“十八杉”，大都生长在贵州省东南部苗族侗族散居的苗岭山麓。这种杉木又长又直，根部和梢端的粗细相差不多。特别受国内各地基本建设单位欢迎的是：普通杉木往往是由内部腐烂起，而“苗杉”虽然表层朽了，木心仍然坚固如初，适合作船桅、柱梁、桩木、枕木等。
