Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 9th—The Dalai Lama and his party, who had been delayed by rain and snow, traveled by car to a monastery on the summit of Gangtok Mountain on the morning of the 8th and chanted scriptures in the temple.

After five consecutive days of heavy rain, the weather cleared for the first time on the morning of the 8th. Along the road that winds up the verdant mountains, villagers welcomed the guests by burning pine leaves. They took off their hats and kowtowed to the Dalai Lama.

Inside the temple, about two hundred local lamas, young and old, received blessings from the Dalai Lama and listened to his sermons.

On the afternoon of February 7th, the Dalai Lama, accompanied by the Maharaja of Sikkim, visited Sikkim's largest demonstration farm, which is thirty miles from Gangtok. The Dalai Lama viewed a small exhibition on the farm. Many products were displayed under thatched sheds, including high-quality oranges and orange products. It is said that the oranges here originally came from China.

The Dalai Lama also visited a veterinary hospital at the foot of the mountain. This hospital was established specifically to treat mules coming from Tibet. More than 300 mules a day carry goods from Tibet to this place. To encourage trade between Tibet and Sikkim, this hospital provides free medical treatment for these mules.

The guests also visited the Gangtok Hospital, which has one hundred and forty beds, the Sikkim High Court, and a girls' middle school with four hundred students.

    达赖喇嘛继续在锡金访问
    新华社新德里9日电　被雨雪滞留的达赖喇嘛一行在8日上午坐车前往刚渡山顶的一个寺院，并在寺内诵经。
    那里在接连下了五天大雨以后，8日早晨初次放晴。沿着树木茂盛的青山迂回而上的道路两旁，山民们燃着松叶欢迎嘉宾。他们向达赖喇嘛脱帽叩头。
    在寺院内，当地两百名左右老少喇嘛受到达赖喇嘛的祝福，并且倾听他讲经。
    2月7日下午，达赖喇嘛由锡金大君陪同参观了离刚渡三十里地方的一个锡金最大的示范农场。达赖喇嘛观看了农场内的小型的展览会。在茅草棚下，展览着许多产品，其中有品种优良的桔子和桔子制品。据说，这里的桔子最初是从中国来的。
    达赖喇嘛还看了山下的一所兽医院。这所医院是专为了治疗从西藏来的骡子而设立的。从西藏驮货物到达这里的骡子每天在三百头以上。为了鼓励西藏和锡金之间的贸易，这所医院免费为这些骡子治病。
    客人们还参观了有一百四十个病床的刚渡医院，锡金的高等法院和有四百名学生的女子中学。
