    Verdi in Beijing	Xiao Qian
    If Giuseppe Verdi, the composer of the Italian opera "La Traviata," could see some of the scenes I witnessed (in fact, he passed away more than half a century ago, so of course, he couldn't), I believe he would be both surprised and moved: It wasn't until the intermission that I realized a farmer was sitting two seats away in the same row. He had a pipe attached to his blue cotton-padded jacket, and he looked like a member of an agricultural cooperative from the nearby suburbs. When the opera ended, and the purple velvet curtain fell and rose again, and Violetta had died and been resurrected, standing at the front of the stage taking a bow, the farmer was still using his sleeve to wipe away tears for that ill-fated girl from ancient Europe. Outside the Tianqiao Theater, cars and bicycles were not uncommon, but that day, a large cart was parked across the street – it turned out that the farmer hadn't come to the city alone to see the opera; several other peasant audience members also gathered in front of the cart afterward.

    In that instant, I saw the promoting role of the great "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy in international cultural exchange, and I also saw the inseparable relationship between immortal artistic works and the masses.

    The human heart is like a string that grows without any concessions. Some works, no matter how much effort you put in, you can't move it at all, while others resonate with a single pluck. Moreover, works that can touch the heartstrings in their own country can also do so abroad; those that could move people in the past can still do so today. The few tears shed by that farmer validated Verdi's "La Traviata."

    To bring a large-scale European classical opera to the Chinese stage – this was something that no music lover would have dared to dream of just a few years ago! An opera like "La Traviata" encompasses centuries of Western European development in music, drama, and dance, and involves infinitely complex techniques in stage design. One cannot help but admire the courage of the comrades at the Central Experimental Opera House and their enthusiasm for learning from the classical masters of music history.

    For example, if Yue Opera enthusiasts in London or Rome planned to stage our "Butterfly Lovers," from singing to acting, from the rhythm of the traditional instruments to the design of every pavilion and dressing table, how many mountains would they have to climb to bring it to the stage! If they really succeeded in performing it, people would not first ask whether their singing and acting were up to par – compared to our Yuan Xuefen and Fan Ruijuan, they certainly wouldn't be – but would admire their ambition and be deeply moved by their noble aspiration to eagerly embrace all the beautiful traditions of the world.

    Therefore, after seeing this performance, I, as a layman, first felt a sense of pride – our opera community finally overcame countless difficulties and brought it to the Chinese stage. This also shows how big our appetite is for absorbing nourishment from the world's cultural heritage.

    Experts will naturally give this performance a fair evaluation. Some shortcomings are also felt by outsiders, such as the fact that the solo singing is sometimes drowned out by the orchestra due to insufficient volume. Some, I feel, seem to be inherent. For example, in the opera's sections that express the emotions of passionate men and women during moments of separation and death, the singer's throat should burst forth with sparks of grief and indignation, as if the mountains are collapsing and the earth is cracking; at these moments, I faintly feel that although the stage scenery is Southern European, the kind of soul-stirring passion of Southern Europeans has been removed from Verdi's music, or rather, replaced by a more restrained Eastern-style emotion. Is this due to the actors' lack of skill, being unable to focus on both singing and expression, or is it an unavoidable distance when Easterners express the emotions of Europeans?

    In this opera, Chinese characters and Western music were "combined" for more than two hours, and its effect is naturally thought-provoking. In general, I don't find this combination unnatural. However, when it comes to "coloratura" passages, the poor monosyllabic Chinese is forced to be used as polysyllabic words, and one only feels that the lyrics are desperately chasing after the rapid-fire notes, sounding like eating apples as if they were grapes, causing a choking sensation in the throat.

    However, these inherent distances actually add another layer of significance to the performance. This time, it can be considered a pioneering effort, and it is precisely from this attempt that we can discover ways to overcome these difficulties in the future. (Attached image)

    威尔第在北京	萧乾
    要是意大利歌剧“茶花女”的作者威尔第能够看见我所看到的一些情景的话（事实上他半个多世纪以前就去世了，当然不可能看见），我估计他一定会很吃惊，也会很感动：直到休息的时候，我才发现同排隔两个位子上坐着的是一位农民老大爷，蓝棉袄上还别着杆烟袋锅子，看去大概是近郊哪个农业合作社的社员。歌剧终了，当紫色的绒幕落而复起，薇奥列塔也已经死而复活，站到台口谢幕的时候，老大爷还在用袖口为古代欧洲那个薄命姑娘抹着眼泪呢。天桥剧场门口汽车、自行车不希罕，可是这一天街对面停了辆大车——原来老大爷还不是孤身一个赶到城里来看歌剧的，随后又有几个农民观众也到大车跟前集合了。
    那一瞬间，我看到伟大的“百花齐放”方针对国际上文化交流所起的促进作用，也看到不朽的文艺作品跟群众之间不可分割的关系。
    人心就好像长着根毫不知迁就的弦，有的作品倾多大力气，硬是拨它不动，有的却一拨就响了。而且，大凡在本国能拨动心弦的作品，走到国外也能；过去的岁月里拨得动的，今天仍然拨得动。那位农民老大爷洒的几滴同情泪，替威尔第的“茶花女”证实了这一点。
    把欧洲的大型古典歌剧搬到中国舞台上来，这是几年以前任何音乐爱好者也不敢梦想的一件事！像“茶花女”这么一出歌剧，它包含着几百年来西欧在音乐、戏剧和舞蹈上的发展，牵涉着舞台设计上无限复杂的技术。谁也不能不佩服中央实验歌剧院同志们的这股勇气，和他们向音乐史上古典大师学习的热情。
    打比方说，要是伦敦或者罗马的越剧爱好者打算上演咱们的“梁祝”，从唱工到做工，从丝竹的板眼到每座楼阁妆台的设计，他们得爬多少道崇山峻岭才能把它搬上舞台去呀！要是他们真地演成了，人们不会首先问他们的唱工做工到不到家——比起我们的袁雪芬、范瑞娟来，他们靠准不会到家——而是赞叹他们的雄心，并且深深被他们那种急于接受世界上一切美好传统的高尚志气所感动。
    所以看了这次的演出，我这个门外汉首先感到的是自豪——我们的歌剧界终归还是冲破千万重困难，把它搬上了中国舞台。这同时也显示出：在从世界文化遗产吸收营养上，我们的胃口有多么大。
    行家们自然会给这次演出以恰如其分的评价。有些美中不足的地方是外行人也感觉到的，譬如由于音量不足，有时候独唱给管弦淹没了。有些，我又觉得好像是先天带来的。譬如歌剧里几段宣泄多情男女在生离死别时分的感情，歌唱者的喉咙里应该接连迸发出悲愤的火花，就像山崩地裂了一般；这当口，我隐隐觉得尽管舞台上的布景是南欧的，南欧人那种胆肝俱裂的激情却从威尔第的音乐里抽掉了，或者说，用比较含蓄的东方式的感情代替了。这究竟是由于演员不够熟练、顾了唱顾不了表情呢，还是东方人在表达欧洲人的感情时难以避免的距离呢？
    在这个歌剧里，中国文字跟西洋音乐“结合”了两个多小时，它的效果自然是耐人寻味的。在一般情况下，我觉得这种结合没有什么不自然。可是遇到“碎音”的地方，可怜单音的中文就硬当作复音字来使唤，只觉得歌词狼狈地追赶着连珠炮般的音符，听了就像拿苹果当葡萄吃那么嗓子里感到噎的慌。
    然而这些先天的距离恰好替演出另外增加了一层意义。这回算是打了个先锋，从这次尝试中正好发现后天克服这些困难的途径。（附图片）
