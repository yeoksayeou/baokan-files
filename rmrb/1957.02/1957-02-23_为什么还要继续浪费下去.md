    Why Continue to Waste?
    It is well known that the Chaka Salt Lake in Qinghai Province contains hundreds of millions of tons of salt. Due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in shipping it out, the Chaka Salt Factory has historically based its production on the needs of the province's life and production, totaling approximately seven thousand tons. In 1954, it only produced ten thousand tons of salt. However, in 1956, the Beijing Salt Administration Bureau suddenly increased the factory's production task to 157,500 tons. At the same time, to meet the needs of increased production, it also invested more than 400,000 yuan in capital construction.

    Why did this factory increase its salt production so much? It is said that in order to ensure the early completion of the First Five-Year Plan, other places did not have the conditions for large-scale production increases, and in the end, there was no way to arrange it, so it was added to the Qinghai Chaka Salt Factory. In 1956, the Chaka Salt Factory produced 190,000 tons of crude salt. How is the produced crude salt to be handled? If it is only used for the needs of consumption, agriculture and animal husbandry in Qinghai Province, the existing salt can be used for twenty to twenty-five years. If it is to be transported out, the transportation capacity is limited. Finally, the Salt Administration Bureau decided to treat it as a national reserve material, to be used as raw material after the chemical plant is built here, and to be transported away after the railway is built. In this way, in 1956, the state purchased 183,000 tons of salt from the Chaka Salt Factory, with a purchase fund of 1.1 million yuan.

    Is it necessary for the state to store so much salt in Qinghai? I don't think it is necessary. First, so much crude salt cannot be transported out of the salt lake temporarily. According to the existing transportation capacity, it will take more than two years to transport all the crude salt produced in 1956 alone. Second, if the produced salt cannot be transported away and is still piled up in the salt lake or stored in the open air, the loss will be great. Now, some of the salt has been washed into the salt pits by water. Third, if the chemical plant is not built, and if the railway does not pass through Chaka, then so much crude salt produced will almost all be scrapped. It should also be noted here that even if the industrial salt users start building the factory now, and the railway is determined to pass through Chaka and construction starts now, it will be enough to increase salt production in two or three years to meet their needs, because in Chaka, to increase salt production, just add more workers and tools to dig it, the raw materials are abundant.

    Therefore, increasing production and "reserving" so much salt in Chaka now, in addition to wasting state funds, is of little benefit. However, the Salt Administration Bureau decided in 1957 to have the Chaka Salt Factory produce another 70,000 tons of salt. I don't know why they want to do this? Some people say that if they don't do this, the national crude salt production task will not be completed. Then, the Chaka Salt Factory has already "reserved" so much product that cannot be transported out or sold, and is only increasingly losing value, like waste. Now, they are still required to produce a large amount. In this way, the Salt Administration Bureau's production plan form can be completed, but what use is the salt stored in Chaka to the country and the people now? I hope the Salt Administration Bureau will not continue to waste. Pei Gaihe

    为什么还要继续浪费下去
    青海省茶卡盐池里蕴藏着几亿吨盐，是众所周知的事情。由于交通不便，外运困难，所以茶卡盐厂在产量方面，历年来都是依据本省生活。生产的需要来安排，总数大约七千多吨。1954年也只生产了一万吨盐。可是，1956年，北京盐务总局突然将这个厂的生产任务增加为十五万七千五百吨。同时为了适应增产的需要，还投资四十多万元进行基本建设。
    为什么要这个厂增产这么多盐呢？据说是为了保证第一个五年计划提前完成，别的地方没有大量增产的条件，最后没法安排，就给青海茶卡盐厂加上了。1956年茶卡盐厂生产了十九万吨原盐。生产出的原盐怎样处理呢？如果只供青海省食用和农牧业的需要，现存盐可用二十年至二十五年。要运走吧，运输力量有限。最后盐务总局决定作为国家储备物资处理，等到这里的化工厂建设起来以后作为原料，等到铁道修起来以后运走。这样，1956年国家收购了茶卡盐厂的十八万三千吨盐，收购资金达一百一十万元。
    国家有没有必要在青海储备那么多盐呢？我认为没有必要。第一、储备那么多原盐暂时运不出盐池。按现有运输能力计算，光1956年生产的原盐，要两年多才能运完。第二、如果生产的盐运不走，仍然在盐池内散堆着或露天存放着，损耗就很大。现在已有一部分盐被水冲到盐坑里去了。第三、如果化工厂不建设，如果铁道也不经过茶卡，那么生产这么多的原盐几乎就要全部报废。这里还应该说明的是，即令工业用盐单位现在就开始建厂，铁道也确定要走茶卡并且现在就开始施工，那么迟两三年再增产盐也来得及满足它们的需要，因为在茶卡要增产盐，只要多增加些工人和工具去挖就可以了，原料有的是。
    所以，现在就在茶卡增产和“储备”那么多盐，除了浪费国家资金以外，实在没有多大好处。可是，盐务总局1957年又决定要茶卡盐厂再生产七万吨盐，我不知道为什么要这样做？有人说，不这样就完不成全国原盐生产任务。那末，茶卡盐厂已经“储备”了那么多既运不出去，也销售不完，只是日益增加损耗的形同废物的产品，现在还要他们大量生产，这样，盐务总局的生产计划表格上的任务是可以完成了，但是，茶卡的存盐，现在对国家和人民又有什么用处呢？我希望盐务总局不要再浪费下去了。　裴改和
