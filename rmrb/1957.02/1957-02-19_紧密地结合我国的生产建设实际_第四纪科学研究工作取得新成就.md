Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lei Peng reports: More than eighty papers presented at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Quaternary Academic Conference show that China has achieved new successes in the study of Quaternary science.

The Quaternary is the most recent period in the Earth's crust history, dating back approximately one million years. Quaternary science aims to identify the distribution patterns of useful minerals, clarify the history of soil formation and analyze its natural environmental conditions, and explore the magnitude of earthquakes by studying the development and changes in the Earth's crust history during the Quaternary period, in order to facilitate the planning and construction of factories, mines, and railways. The papers presented this time are closely integrated with China's actual production and construction.

China's Quaternary scientists have conducted detailed studies of the types, distribution, properties, and development of the Quaternary period in the Sanmenxia area, as well as its landform overview and the history of landform development. Conducting Quaternary-related investigations and research independently on such a large scale is the first time in China's comprehensive Quaternary research. It not only provides important data for the construction of dams and the solution of Yellow River channel siltation but also establishes a foundation for future comprehensive research in Quaternary science.

In coordination with the comprehensive development work of the Yellow River Basin, a survey team of more than 500 people spent more than two years conducting a large-scale soil survey in the North China Plain, covering 120,000 square kilometers. Based on the Quaternary strata, soil scientists investigated the soil formation process and salinization conditions in this plain area, studied soil improvement in the North China region, especially the reduction of salinization problems, and the rational utilization of land. The data obtained from this research provides conditions for washing out the salt in the soil in the drainage system and supplying plants with sufficient water during large-scale irrigation in the North China Plain region in the future. Some scientists have conducted relatively comprehensive observations and studies on the properties, stratification, and landforms of loess in areas such as western Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, and eastern Gansu. China has vast loess areas, and soil erosion in loess areas is very serious. Their research provides a theoretical basis in terms of geology and landforms for soil and water conservation work.

In recent years, Chinese scientists have collected a great deal of data related to the Quaternary period. They have conducted widespread research on Quaternary geology and landforms in petroleum prospecting and exploration areas, mineral areas, water conservancy project construction areas, as well as along railway and highway lines and in agricultural construction areas, and have compiled geological maps and landform maps of various scales. The national Quaternary classification map exhibited at this conference shows in detail the development of Quaternary geological landforms.

Quaternary science is a very broad and comprehensive science. Whether it is theoretical questions raised by observing natural phenomena or practical problems in production and construction, various sciences—including Quaternary geology, hydrogeology, engineering geology, soil science, paleontology, paleoanthropology, and archeology—are needed for research. In the past, China's research on Quaternary science was limited to very narrow aspects. This conference explored the significance of soil science in the study of Quaternary geological history, as well as issues related to geobotany and micropaleontology, which had not been explored in the past.

Quaternary science has not yet formed a complete and independent science in China. This academic conference specifically formed a Quaternary Research Committee. It has initially determined more than ten major scientific research tasks related to the Quaternary. It is expected that this will lead to the development of this science in the future.

This academic conference lasted for five days. It ended on the 15th.

    紧密地结合我国的生产建设实际
    第四纪科学研究工作取得新成就
    新华社讯　新华社记者雷朋报道：中国科学院第四纪学术会议中宣读的八十多篇论文表明，我国在第四纪科学的研究方面已获得新成就。
    第四纪是地壳历史最近的时期，距现在大约有一百万年。第四纪科学是从研究第四纪地壳历史的发展变化中，找出有用矿物的分布规律，阐明土壤生成历史并分析它的自然环境条件，探讨地震强度大小，以便于计划工厂、矿山和铁道的兴建。这次提出的论文就紧密地结合着我国的生产建设实际。
    中国的第四纪科学工作者详细研究了三门峡地区第四纪的类型、分布、性质和发展；地貌概况和地貌发展史。在这样大的范围内单独进行有关第四纪的调查、研究，在中国第四纪综合性的研究上还算第一次，它不只为建设水坝和解决黄河河道淤积提供了重要资料，并且为今后第四纪科学的综合研究建立了基础。
    配合黄河流域的综合开发工作，由五百多人组成的调查队，用了两年多的时间曾在十二万平方公里的华北平原进行了大规模的土壤调查。土壤学家根据第四纪地层情况，调查了这个平原地区成土过程和盐渍情况，研究了华北地区的土壤改良，特别是减轻盐渍化问题以及土地的合理利用问题。这一研究中获得的资料，为今后华北平原地区进行大规模灌溉时在排水系统中洗出土壤里的盐分，并且供给植物以足够的水分，提供了条件。有的科学家在晋西、陕北和陇东等地区，对黄土的性质、分层和地貌等方面进行了比较全面的观察、研究。我国地面有广大的黄土区，黄土区的水土流失很严重，他们的这一研究，为水土保持工作提供了在地质地貌等方面的理论根据。
    近年来，我国科学工作者收集了很多有关第四纪的资料。他们在石油普查勘探区、矿产区、水利工程建设地区以及铁道公路沿线和农业建设区等地，普遍地对第四纪地质、地貌进行了研究，并填制了各种不同比例尺的地质图和地貌图。在这次会议上展出的有关第四纪全国性的分类图，详细表明了第四纪地质地貌的发展情况。
    第四纪科学是一门非常广泛的综合性科学，无论是观察自然现象提出的理论问题或生产建设中的实际问题，都需要各种科学——包括第四纪地质学、水文地质学、工程地质学、土壤学、古生物学、古人类学和考古学等科学来进行研究。过去我国对第四纪科学的研究限制在很狭窄的方面。这次会议则探讨了过去没有探讨过的土壤学在研究第四纪地史中的意义、地植物和微古生物等方面的问题。
    第四纪科学在我国过去还没有形成一门完整的独立科学。这次学术会议专门组成了第四纪研究委员会。初步确定了有关第四纪方面十多项重大科学的研究工作。预料在今后将使这门科学发展起来。
    这次学术会议共举行了五天。已在15日结束。
