Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th - British Army, Navy, and Air Force authorities announced today that the British armed forces will be reduced by 65,500 personnel between 1957 and 1958. Among them, the Army will be reduced by 42,000, the Navy by 6,500, and the Air Force by 17,000. The number of personnel in the three services after the reductions will be: Army: 443,000; Navy: 121,500; Air Force: 240,000.

The focus of this reduction is on the British armed forces stationed in Europe (including the British mainland), where the number of armed forces stationed in this region will be reduced from the original 340,000 to 300,000.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th - London News: Britain is taking steps to streamline its armed forces to adapt to its "atomic strategy."

On the 19th, Britain announced the establishment of its first guided weapons regiment, which is considered the "latest step" in the streamlining effort. This unit is composed of officers and soldiers who have received army training in the United States and is armed with "Corporal" missiles.

At the same time, more and more news is circulating that Britain is considering reducing its armed forces stationed overseas. In addition to the already decided reduction of troops stationed in West Germany, the "Daily Mail" revealed that Britain will withdraw its Tenth Armored Division from Libya. There are also reports that troop reductions are being considered in other parts of North Africa, as well as in Hong Kong and Gibraltar.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th - British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Peter Thorneycroft, announced in the House of Commons on the 19th that the government has decided to cut 57 million pounds in social spending this year.

He said that starting from April 1st, the price of welfare milk supplied to children under five years old and pregnant women will increase. The price of milk powder will also increase accordingly. The government can obtain 14 million pounds from this. At this point, Labour Party members shouted loudly: "Resign!"

Thorneycroft also announced that the fees for school meals, which were originally subsidized by the government, will also increase from April. The government can obtain 3.5 million pounds from this. As soon as he said this, shouts of "Resign!" resounded again.

Thorneycroft continued, saying that the national insurance contributions paid by each Briton for health care will also increase, which will allow the government to obtain approximately 40 million pounds.

Thorneycroft revealed that, excluding defense and self-balancing projects, the government's expenditure for the next year is estimated at 2.654 billion pounds, 173 million pounds more than the original estimate for this year.

Opposition Labour Party members shouted "shameful," believing that this was "making children suffer" and "attacking the poorest people."

    英政府宣布削减军队整编部队
    减少社会事业经费加紧勒索人民
    新华社伦敦20日电　据英国陆、海、空军当局今天宣布：英国武装部队将在1957—58年间削减六万五千五百人。其中，陆军将削减四万二千人，海军将削减六千五百人，空军将削减一万七千人。削减后的三军人数是——陆军：四十四万三千人；海军：十二万一千五百人；空军二十四万人。
    这次削减的重点是英国驻在欧洲（包括英国本土在内）的武装部队，驻在这一地区的武装部队将从原来的三十四万人减为三十万人。
    据新华社20日讯　伦敦消息：英国正在采取步骤来整编它的武装部队，以适应它的“原子战略”。
    19日，英国宣布成立第一个定向武器团，这被认为是整编工作“最新的步骤”。这支部队是由在美国受过陆军训练的官兵组成，并且是由“下士”式导弹武装起来的。
    在这同时，传出越来越多的消息说英国正考虑裁减驻海外各地的武装部队问题。除已经决定裁减驻西德的部队以外，据“每日邮报”透露，英国将从利比亚撤出它的第十装甲师。另外还有消息说，北非其他地方以及香港和直布罗陀等地的驻军也在考虑裁减之列。
    据新华社伦敦20日电　英国财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特19日在下院宣布，政府决定在今年削减社会事业费五千七百万英镑。
    他说，从4月1日开始，供给五岁以下的儿童和孕妇的福利牛奶将要涨价。奶粉价格也要相应提高。政府今年可以从这里得到一千四百万英镑。这时，工党议员高声叫喊：“辞职！”
    桑尼克罗夫特还宣布：原来受政府补贴的学校膳食，从4月起也要增加收费。政府可以从这方面得到三百五十万镑。刚说到这里，“辞职”的喊声又响成一片。
    桑尼克罗夫特接着说，每个英国人为了保健事业所支付的国民保险费也要增加，这样可以使政府得到大约四千万镑。
    桑尼克罗夫特透露，除了国防和可以自己平衡的项目外，政府下一年的开支估计为二十六亿五千四百万镑，比今年原来的估计多一亿七千三百万镑。
    反对党工党议员高呼“可耻”，认为这是“使小孩受痛苦”和“向最贫困的人进攻”。
