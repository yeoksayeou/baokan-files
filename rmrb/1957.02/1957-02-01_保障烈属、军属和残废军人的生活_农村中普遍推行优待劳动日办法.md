Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Agricultural production cooperatives have universally implemented the method of preferential labor days for families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans who lack labor power, ensuring their livelihoods.

1956 was the first year for promoting the method of preferential labor days. This method involves agricultural production cooperatives using the average labor days earned per person per year as the standard, deducting the number of labor days that the families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans can contribute themselves, and the cooperative providing preferential subsidies for the shortfall. According to statistics from over 34,000 families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans in 22 counties and cities, including Shuyang, Tongshan, and Yancheng in Jiangsu Province, agricultural cooperatives have provided them with over 1.5 million preferential labor days, basically ensuring that their living standards are not lower than those of ordinary cooperative members. In 104 agricultural cooperatives in Funing, Shahe, Changli and other three counties in Hebei Province, the 1,494 families of martyrs, military dependents and disabled veterans who enjoyed preferential treatment received a total of 558,000 yuan in the autumn harvest distribution, an increase of 33.4% over 1955.

In addition to promoting the method of preferential labor days, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions also provide appropriate consideration to the semi-labor force and female labor force of families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans in terms of division of labor and industry, giving them priority in assigning light and easy labor within their capabilities. The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Ji County, Hebei Province, a model cooperative in providing preferential treatment, made overall plans for the male and female labor force of families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans, assigning work according to their abilities and paying equal pay for equal work. A total of 18 kinds of farm work suitable for their labor were arranged. By the autumn, they had actually completed 1,228 self-made labor days, exceeding the self-made labor days assessed in the spring by 11%. Even Su Tingshun, a 76-year-old family member of a martyr, earned 150 labor days in a year by guarding the fields in the cooperative. As a result of the autumn harvest distribution, the income of every family of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans in this cooperative increased. Some places also arrange for families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans who cannot work in the fields to engage in household sideline production to increase their income. Many cooperative members also voluntarily organize preferential treatment groups to help the orphaned, widowed, elderly, and weak families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans solve difficulties in their daily lives.

In order to ensure that the lives of families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans are guaranteed and their incomes can be increased, relevant departments in various regions conducted multiple inspections of the work of preferential labor days last year. During the autumn harvest distribution, counties and cities in Shandong Province organized more than 800 township cadres to inspect the work of preferential labor days. Leading cadres in some provinces and counties personally went to households to check the income of families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans, and promptly corrected unreasonable preferential treatment. In disaster areas, because the value of labor days was relatively low, the lives of families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans could not be guaranteed. In addition to organizing them to carry out production for self-salvation together with other disaster victims, the local government also issued preferential assistance funds to solve their living difficulties.

Since last year was the first year for promoting the method of preferential labor days, there are still some problems and shortcomings in this work. In some places, the labor days preferentially provided to families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans are relatively few, and their lives cannot be guaranteed. Regarding these problems, local governments are conducting inspections in conjunction with the activities of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families during the Spring Festival.

### 保障烈属、军属和残废军人的生活  农村中普遍推行优待劳动日办法

    保障烈属、军属和残废军人的生活
    农村中普遍推行优待劳动日办法
    据新华社31日讯　农业生产合作社对缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属、残废军人采取优待劳动日的办法已经在全国各地普遍推行，这种优待办法保证了烈属、军属、残废军人的生活。
    1956年是推行优待劳动日办法的第一年。这种办法就是农业生产合作社以每人每年平均所得的劳动日为标准，扣除烈属、军属、残废军人自己能做的劳动日数，不足部分由合作社优待补助。据江苏省沭阳、铜山、盐城等二十二个县、市三万四千多户烈属、军属、残废军人的统计，各农业社共对他们优待了一百五十多万个劳动日，基本上保证了他们的生活水平不低于一般社员的生活水平。河北省抚宁、沙河、昌黎等三个县一百零四个农业社中，享受优待的一千四百九十四户烈属、军属和残废军人，在秋收分配中共分到五十五万八千多元，比1955年的收入增加了33.4％。
    各地农业生产合作社除了推行优待劳动日的办法以外，还在分工分业上对烈属、军属、残废军人的半劳动力和妇女劳动力给予适当的照顾，优先分配他们力所能及的轻便的劳动。河北省蓟县优抚模范社——红星农业社对烈属、军属、残废军人的男女劳动力作了通盘规划，按人分工分业，同工同酬，共计安排各种适合他们劳动的农活十八种，到秋后他们实际完成的自做劳动日有一千二百二十八个，超过了春季评定的自做劳动日11％，连七十六岁的烈属苏廷顺在社里看场一年也做了一百五十个劳动日。秋收分配结果，这个社的烈属、军属、残废军人户户都增加了收入。有些地方还安排不能上地劳动的烈属、军属、残废军人进行家庭副业生产来增加收入。许多农业社社员还自动组织优抚小组，帮助孤寡老弱的烈属、军属和残废军人解决日常生活中的困难。
    为了争取烈属、军属、残废军人的生活有保障并能增加收入，去年一年各地有关部门对优待劳动日的工作进行了多次检查。山东省各县、市在秋收分配中组织了八百多个乡干部对优待劳动日工作做了检查。有些省、县的领导干部亲自深入到户检查烈属、军属和残废军人的收入情况，对优待不合理的现象及时作了纠正。在灾区，由于劳动日的分值比较低，烈属、军属、残废军人的生活不能得到保证，当地政府除了组织他们同其他灾民一起开展生产自救以外，还发放了优抚补助费来解决他们的生活困难。
    由于去年还是推行优待劳动日办法的第一年，这一工作中还存在着一些问题和缺点。有的地方对烈属、军属、残废军人优待的劳动日比较少，不能保证他们的生活。对这些问题，各地政府正在结合春节期间的拥军优属活动进行检查。
