Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 24th: Czechoslovakia is currently laying hundreds of kilometers of long-distance gas pipelines in order to send natural gas from production areas to industrial cities, making extensive use of it as a fuel to replace coal.

In the natural gas production area between Břeclav and Bratislava, two main gas pipelines have already been laid. One runs northwest to Brno, the second largest city in Czechoslovakia, and the other runs south to Bratislava, the fourth largest city in Czechoslovakia, and then turns northeast through Trnava to Nové Mesto. The latter main pipeline will be extended to the town of Silina, near the Polish border, in the next two years.

The natural gas pipeline from near Brno to Prague, which is more than 200 kilometers long, will be the longest gas pipeline in the country when it is completed early next year.

Extensive use of natural gas as a fuel is an important measure currently being taken by Czechoslovakia to adapt to the growing need for fuel in industrial development. Ten years ago, natural gas accounted for less than 9% of the country's gas consumption, but it has now increased to 30%. In early February of this year, the Czechoslovak government decided to use natural gas as fuel in more factories this year. Currently, half of the natural gas consumption is concentrated in the Slovak region. In the near future, it will be widely used in the Czech region, where industry is most concentrated.

In recent years, Czechoslovakia has discovered abundant reserves of natural gas. By 1956, the reserves had increased to several billion cubic meters. It has now been determined that the area with the richest natural gas reserves is the oil field between Břeclav and Bratislava in the south.

Before 1951, the country had only one natural gas pipeline, no more than forty or fifty kilometers long. Now the length of the country's natural gas pipelines has increased four or five times compared to the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 24th: According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency: The annual output of the largest brown coal area in Czechoslovakia, the North Bohemian coalfield, has increased from less than 20 million tons in the early days of liberation to 31 million tons in 1956, exceeding the 1956 plan by one million tons. This year, the miners here also plan to overfulfill the plan to mine more than 33 million tons of brown coal.

According to current estimates, the brown coal reserves in the North Bohemian coalfield are more than eight billion tons. If mining continues at the current rate, the coal reserves here will be sufficient for another hundred years of mining.

    适应工业发展对燃料的迫切需要
    捷大力铺设长距离天然煤气管
    最大褐煤区今年将产煤三千三百万吨以上
    新华社布拉格24日电　捷克斯洛伐克目前正在铺设长达数百公里的长距离煤气管，以便把天然煤气从产地送往工业城市，大量利用它来代替煤作燃料。
    在布烈茨拉夫和布拉迪斯拉发之间的天然煤气产地，人们已经铺设了两条煤气总管。一条向西北通往捷克斯洛伐克第二大城市布尔诺，一条向南通往捷克斯洛伐克第四大城市布拉迪斯拉发，又折向东北经过塔尔纳伐到达诺维麦斯托。后一条总管将在今、明两年中延长到接近波兰边境的西利那城。
    从布尔诺附近通往布拉格的长达二百多公里的天然煤气管在明年初建成以后，将是全国最长的一条煤气管。
    大量利用天然煤气作燃料是捷克斯洛伐克目前适应日益增长的工业发展对于燃料的需要的一个重要措施。十年以前，天然煤气在全国煤气消费量中所占的比重还不到9％，目前已经增加到30％。今年2月初，捷克斯洛伐克政府决定今年在更多的工厂中使用天然煤气作燃料。目前，天然煤气的利用量有一半是集中在斯洛伐克地区。在不久的将来，它将被大量地在工业最集中的捷克地区利用。
    近几年来，捷克斯洛伐克发现有丰富的天然煤气蕴藏。到1956年这方面的蕴藏量增加到了几十亿立方公尺。目前已经探明，天然煤气储藏量最丰富的地区是南部的布烈茨拉夫和布拉迪斯拉发之间的石油矿区。
    在1951年以前，全国只有一条不过四、五十公里的天然煤气管。现在全国的天然煤气管道的长度已经比过去增加了四、五倍。
    据新华社布拉格24日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克全国最大的褐煤区——北波希米亚煤田的年产量，已经由解放初期的不到两千万吨增加到1956年的三千一百万吨。比1956年计划规定多一百万吨。今年，这里的矿工还打算超额完成开采三千三百万吨以上的褐煤的计划。
    据目前的估计，北波希米亚煤田的褐煤储藏量在八十亿吨以上。如果继续按照目前的速度开采，这里的煤藏足够再开采约一百年。
