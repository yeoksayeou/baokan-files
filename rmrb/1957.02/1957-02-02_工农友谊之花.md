    Flower of Worker-Peasant Friendship
    On the eve of the Spring Festival, four pots of lush green centipede grass, cacti, and ever-blooming begonias were newly placed on the desks of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company construction engineering company. The sunlight after a long rain shone through the glass windows of the construction site office, illuminating the budding begonia blossoms.
    These four pots of flowers and plants were taken out of their cellars by the members of the Third Agricultural Production Cooperative and given to the builders on the 27th, when more than one hundred cadres of the construction engineering company braved the muddy roads to pay a friendly visit to the surrounding rural areas. The members of the agricultural cooperative told the visiting guests that they had a bumper harvest in 1956, with an average increase of more than 100 jin of grain per mu compared to 1955, and they were very grateful for the construction workers' kindness in providing them with a large amount of manure free of charge.
    The budding begonia flowers are a symbol of the friendship between the workers and peasants on this construction site over the past few months. When the builders of the construction company were working on the Wuhan Iron and Steel project, the members of the surrounding agricultural cooperatives provided the construction site with their waterwheels and stone rollers to help the builders compact the foundation of a factory building. When the construction site needed labor, the agricultural cooperatives sent people to the construction site to work as temporary workers and carry materials.
    As the Spring Festival was approaching, the construction engineering company decided to thank the members of the agricultural cooperatives for their support for the construction. In addition to visiting the rural areas, the company also selected Xiu Zhende and Xiu Yanrong, the best bricklayers from the nationally renowned Su Changyou bricklaying team, and carpenter Xu Taizhong, to go to the homes of military families and widowed and orphaned farmers in the rural areas around the construction site to help them repair their houses and furniture.
    The weather was changeable, sometimes cloudy and sometimes sunny, with occasional drizzles. Xiu Zhende and Xiu Yanrong carried white ash and cement on one end of a shoulder pole and sand on the other, while Xu Taizhong carried carpentry tools and scrap wood, walking along the winding and muddy field ridges, covering three villages, and working for two days. At the home of an old Mrs. Chen in Chenjiawan, Xiu Zhende and the other two repaired the eaves and roof with white ash and mortar, and also helped the old lady chop more than 200 jin of firewood for the Spring Festival. Old Mrs. Chen said to Xiu Zhende: My kitchen is too dark, and I can't see clearly when I'm cooking. Xiu Zhende and the others immediately started to open a window for her kitchen, and in an instant, the sunlight illuminated the kitchen that had been dark for many years.
    At the home of another widowed old Mrs. Chen, carpenter Xu Taizhong repaired a hand-cranked spinning wheel for the old lady. This spinning wheel was part of the dowry that the old lady brought with her when she married at the age of nineteen, and she had been using it for a full forty-six years. The axle of the spinning wheel was originally as thick as an egg, but now it had been worn down to the point of breaking. Xu Taizhong quickly replaced it with a new axle with his skillful hands, and the old lady smiled from ear to ear.
    The people who visited the rural areas brought back these four pots of flowers and plants, and everyone felt warm and grateful in their hearts. Because they cherished these four pots of flowers of worker-peasant friendship, the builders placed them on the desks of the company manager and the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee, so that they could see them at first glance every morning when they went to work. In addition, the carpenters in the company also specially used waste boards from the construction site to rush to make five long benches, preparing to paint the words "Worker-Peasant Friendship" on them and return them as gifts to the agricultural production cooperative that gave the flowers.

    工农友谊之花
    春节前夕，武汉钢铁公司工地砌筑工程公司的办公桌上，新摆上了四盆青翠欲滴的蜈蚣草、仙人球和四季海棠。久雨乍晴的阳光，射进工地办公室的玻璃窗，照耀着含苞欲放的海棠花蕾。
    这四盆花草，是砌筑工程公司一百多名干部在27日踏着泥泞的道路，到工地周围农村进行友好访问时，第三农业生产合作社的社员们从地窖里拿出来送给建筑者的。农业社的社员们对前来访问的客人们说，1956年他们获得了丰收，每亩粮食产量平均比1955年增产一百多斤，他们非常感激工地建筑者们免费供给他们大量粪肥的盛情。
    含苞待放的海棠花，正是几个月来这个工地上的工人和农民之间友谊的象征。砌筑公司的建筑者在武钢施工时，周围农业社的社员们曾经把自己的水车、石滚碾供给工地，帮助建筑者们夯实了一个厂房的基础。当工地上需要劳动力时，农业社派人到工地当临时工，搬运材料。
    春节快要来临时，砌筑工程公司决定答谢农业社社员们对建设的支援。除了到农村访问外，公司还从全国著名的苏长有砌砖小组里抽出技术最好的砌砖工人修振德、修彦荣和木工徐太中，到工地周围农村的军人家属和孤寡农户家里去帮助他们修理房屋和家具。
    天气忽阴忽晴，时而落着霏霏细雨。修振德和修彦荣一头挑着白灰、洋灰，一头挑着砂子，徐太中挑着木匠用的工具和废木料，沿着弯曲泥泞的田埂，走了三个村子，工作了两天。在陈家湾一个陈老太太家里，修振德等三人用白灰、沙浆修补了房檐、屋顶，还帮助老太太劈了二百多斤过春节用的木柴。陈老太太对修振德说：我家里厨房太暗，做饭时看不清楚。修振德等又马上动手给她的厨房开了个窗户，一霎时，阳光就照亮了这个常年黑暗的厨房。
    在另一家孤寡的陈老太太家里，木工徐太中给老太太修好了一架手摇纺花车。这架纺花车是这位老太太十九岁出嫁时陪送的嫁奁，她已经用了整整四十六年了。纺花车的轴原来有鸡蛋那样粗，现在已经磨得快要断了。徐太中用他那双灵巧的手，很快地给换上了一个新轴，老太太笑得合不拢嘴。
    到农村访问的人带回了这四盆花草，大家心里感到又温暖、又感激。因为珍视这四盆工农友谊之花，建筑者把它们放在公司经理和中共党委书记的写字台上，他们每天清晨上班，第一眼就能看见它。此外，公司里的木工们，还特地利用工地上的废板材，赶制五条长凳，准备漆上工农友谊的字样，回赠给送花的农业生产合作社。
