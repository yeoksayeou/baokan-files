Xinhua News Agency, February 21st. Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui gave a report this morning to the representatives attending the National Labor Model Representative Conference.

Deng Zihui first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on the convocation of the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference and on the brilliant achievements made by the participating representatives in their past work.

Deng Zihui said that the past year was a year in which our country marched towards socialism and achieved great victories on all fronts. Our current agricultural labor model conference is being held after such a great victory. The summary and exchange of experiences at this conference will surely play a significant role in consolidating our collectivization cause and further developing our agricultural production. He then elaborated in detail on four issues: "The Important Position of Agricultural Production in the Country's Socialist Construction," "Our Country's Agricultural Production Management Policies," "How to Increase the Unit Area Yield (of Crops)," and "How to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives Well" (the full text of the report is on pages two and three).

In the afternoon and evening, representatives from various provinces held discussions on Deng Zihui's report. During the discussions, the representatives said that they had not had a clear understanding of these issues in the past, but after listening to the report, their minds were enlightened and they became clear. Yu Kaiyuan, director of the Dengta Cooperative in Lulong County, Hebei Province, said: In the past, I did not have such a deep understanding of the relationship between agricultural production and national industrialization, nor did I fully understand the principle of giving priority to the development of grain production while developing cotton and other cash crops and diverse economies in appropriate proportions. Many representatives said that after listening to the report, they further strengthened their confidence in running the cooperatives well and striving for a bumper harvest this year.

Huang Haicheng, director of the Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, which created the national record for large-area high yield of double-cropping rice, said that their agricultural cooperative's more than 7,000 mu of rice plans to increase the average yield per mu by fifty jin this year compared to last year. The cooperative now has twenty-eight times more public accumulation than in 1955, and the accumulated fertilizer is more than last year. With the favorable conditions of realizing advanced collectivization, they are confident in overfulfilling this year's production tasks. Zhang Fugui, director of the Mingxing Cooperative in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, and an old model worker, also said confidently that the Mingxing Cooperative's production conditions are much better this year than last year. The irrigated area is more than double that of last year, and the area of soil improvement is also larger than last year. They will definitely be able to achieve the plan to increase grain production by 400,000 jin.

Many other representatives said in their speeches that they would continue to implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally to develop production and increase the income of cooperative members. Wang Guofan, director of the Jianming Agricultural Cooperative in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, which is famous for running cooperatives diligently and frugally, said: In the future, we will continue to strengthen the management and leadership of increasing production and practicing economy, and use the reduction of non-productive expenditures to better develop production. Many other representatives said in their speeches that in the future, they would strengthen their ties with the masses and strengthen democratic management, using the wisdom and work enthusiasm of the masses to run the cooperatives well.

Representatives from Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Shandong and other provinces also talked about the development of pig raising and diversified operations in their speeches.

    就农业生产的重大意义和经营方针等四个问题
    邓子恢向农业劳动模范代表作报告
    各省代表分别进行讨论，加强了办好合作社和争取大丰收的信心
    新华社21日讯　国务院副总理邓子恢今天上午向出席全国劳动模范代表会议的代表作了报告。
    邓子恢首先代表中共中央和国务院对全国农业劳动模范代表会议的召开和与会代表们在过去工作中所获得的光辉成就表示热烈祝贺。
    邓子恢说，过去一年，是我国向社会主义进军、在各个战线上取得巨大胜利的一年。我们这次农业劳模会议正是在这样一个伟大胜利之后召开的。通过这次会议的总结交流经验工作，对巩固我们的合作化事业和进一步发展我们的农业生产，必将起着重大的推进作用。接着他就“农业生产在国家社会主义建设中所处的重要地位”、“我国农业生产的经营方针”、“如何提高（农作物的）单位面积产量”和“如何把农业生产合作社办好”等四个问题作了详细的阐述（报告全文见第二、三版）。
    下午和晚上，各省代表就邓子恢的报告分别进行了讨论。讨论中，代表们说，过去对这几个问题都认识得不够清楚，听了报告，脑子亮了，明确了。河北省卢龙县灯塔社主任于开元说：过去对于农业生产和国家工业化的关系认识可没有这样深刻，对优先发展粮食生产同时以适当比例发展棉花和其他经济作物和多种经济的道理也不够理解。许多代表都表示：听了报告后，进一步加强了办好合作社和争取今年大丰收的信心。
    创造全国双季稻大面积丰产纪录的福建省海澄县黎明农业生产合作社主任黄海澄说，他们这个农业社七千多亩水稻，今年每亩的平均产量计划要比去年增产五十斤。现在全社拥有的公共积累比1955年增加了二十八倍，而现在攒积的肥料又比去年多，加上实现了高级合作化的有利条件，超额完成今年的生产任务是有把握的。山东省文登县明星社主任、老模范张富贵也满有信心地说，明星社今年的生产条件比去年好多了，灌溉面积比去年多一倍多，土壤改良的面积也比去年大，一定能实现增产粮食四十万斤的计划。
    还有许多代表在发言中表示要继续贯彻勤俭办社的方针，来发展生产和增加社员收入。以勤俭办社著名的河北省遵化县建明农业社主任王国藩说：我们今后还要继续加强对增产节约的管理和领导，用减少非生产性的开支更好地来发展生产。还有许多代表在发言中表示今后在工作中要加强对群众的联系，并加强民主管理，用发挥群众的智慧和工作积极性来办好合作社。
    河北、辽宁、吉林、山东等省的代表在发言中，还谈到了发展养猪和多种经营等问题。
