    Achieving Two Benefits with One Action
    The offices of the Ministry of Finance and the staff of the Sports Publishing House are relatively far from their dormitories, but their dormitories are close to each other's offices. Based on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, they exchanged their respective staff dormitories after consultation. This saves manpower and resources: the two units can save a total of 6,200 yuan in gasoline and tram fares throughout the year; it can reduce the time spent by employees commuting to and from work. This approach not only conforms to the principle of frugality, but also benefits both work and individuals, and is worthy of everyone's learning. But to do this, it requires a spirit of mutual care. If both parties are calculating and afraid of losing out, it will be difficult to reach an agreement.

    一举两利
    财政部和体育出版社职工的办公室都离宿舍较远，可是他们的宿舍都离对方办公室较近。他们根据自愿、两利的原则，经过协商，交换了各自的职工宿舍。这样就节省了人力、物力：两个单位全年共计可节省汽油、电车费六千二百元；可减少职工上下班在路上往返的时间。这种做法不但合乎节约原则，而且对工作对个人都有利，值得大家学习。但要这样做，需要有相互照顾的精神。如果双方都斤斤计较，怕自己吃亏，那就很难达成协议。
