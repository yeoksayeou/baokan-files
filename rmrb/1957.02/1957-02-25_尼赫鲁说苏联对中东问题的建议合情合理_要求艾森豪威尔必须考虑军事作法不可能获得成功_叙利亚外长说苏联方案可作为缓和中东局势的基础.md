Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 24th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said on the 23rd that the direction of the Soviet Union's recently proposed plan to resolve the Middle East issue is correct.

At a gathering in Bangalore, he said that this plan is worth considering. It would be unwise to reject it. The plan can be fully discussed. The plan seems reasonable.

Nehru said that in some countries, there has been criticism that the Soviet proposal is a "conspiracy," a "trick," and that such a proposal is "ulteriorly motivated."

Nehru said, "Perhaps it is. I don't know. But in essence—if I may say so—the suggestion to free the Middle East from foreign armed intervention and military alliances and to provide economic assistance, seems to me a good suggestion."

Nehru also said that regardless of whether the proposal is "ulteriorly motivated," there is no harm in discussing it and suggesting revisions to improve it. "But literally speaking, the suggestion is reasonable, and I think its direction is also correct. In fact, it is completely consistent with what we said in the Panchsheel."

Nehru said that this proposal will help to seek peace in this "troubled region" of West Asia and will prevent West Asia from becoming "a battlefield where various treaties, armies, and military means compete with each other. I am not saying it is a quick fix, but its direction is correct."

In his speech, Nehru made a special appeal to US President Eisenhower. He said that the United States has a great responsibility in maintaining peace. He asked President Eisenhower to fully consider that in the past "military methods" have not succeeded in West Asia or elsewhere, and such methods are unlikely to succeed in the future.

Nehru said that the United States can help West Asian countries develop economically and in other aspects. However, all the assistance that the United States might offer in that way is rendered futile by military methods. "Due to this military approach, all or most of the benefits are cancelled out."

At the same time, Nehru also believes that the Soviet Union, another major power in the world, bears a great responsibility in maintaining world peace. He said: "I earnestly hope that whether it is the Soviet Union or some other country, will gradually implement this policy of withdrawing foreign troops stationed in other countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 24th: The Czechoslovak "Red Right Newspaper" reported on the 23rd that Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, when meeting with "Red Right Newspaper" special correspondent Plahetka, said that the Soviet Union's recent proposal on the Middle East can serve as the basis for a policy of easing tensions in the Middle East.

In his conversation, Bitar reiterated his opposition to the occupation of the Gaza Strip by the United Nations Emergency Force and condemned the position of Western countries, considering it unjust.

When talking about the relationship between Syria and Lebanon, Bitar said that imperialism is using every means to undermine the unity of Arab countries, inciting one country against another. If there are tensions between Arab countries, one can always find imperialists behind the scenes. However, artificial tensions have further strengthened the unity of the people of Arab countries, a fact that "makes us optimistic about the situation created in relations with Lebanon."

When talking about the relationship between Czechoslovakia and Syria, Bitar said that Czechoslovakia is our friendly country, and it has provided us with what we need.

    尼赫鲁说苏联对中东问题的建议合情合理
    要求艾森豪威尔必须考虑军事作法不可能获得成功
    叙利亚外长说苏联方案可作为缓和中东局势的基础
    新华社新德里24日电　印度总理尼赫鲁23日说，苏联最近提出的解决中东问题的方案的方向是正确的。
    他在班加罗尔的一次集会上说，这个方案是值得考虑的。拒绝这个方案是不智的。可以对这个计划进行充分的讨论。这个方案似乎是合情理的。
    尼赫鲁说，在某些国家，有人提出批评说，苏联的建议是“阴谋”，是“把戏”，而且这种建议是“别有用心”的。
    尼赫鲁说：“也许是这样的。我不知道。可是从本质上说——如果我可以这样说的话——主张使中东地区摆脱外来的武装干涉和军事联盟并且给予经济援助的建议，在我看来，是一个好的建议。”
    尼赫鲁还说，不管这种建议是不是“别有用心”，讨论这种建议并且提出修改意见来改进它是没有害处的。“但是，从字面上看来，这个建议是合情理的，我想，它的方向也是正确的。事实上，它同我们在潘查希拉中所说的是完全一致的。”
    尼赫鲁说，这种建议将会有助于设法实现西亚这个“多事地区”的和平，并且将会防止西亚成为“各种条约、军队和军事手段互相角逐的战场。我并不是说它是一种迅速奏效的药方，但是它的方向是正确的。”
    尼赫鲁在演说中特别向美国总统艾森豪威尔发出呼吁。他说，美国在维护和平方面负有巨大的责任。他要求艾森豪威尔总统必须充分考虑到，过去“军事方法”没有能够在西亚或者其他地方获得成功，今后这种方法也不大可能获得成功。
    尼赫鲁说，美国能够帮助西亚国家在经济方面和其他方面得到发展。但是，美国可能以那种方式提出的一切援助都由于军事作法而归于徒然了。“由于这种军事作法，一切或者大部分好处都被勾销了。”
    同时尼赫鲁也认为，世界上另一个大国苏联在维持世界和平方面负有巨大的责任。他说：“我恳切地希望，不管是苏联也好，是其他某个国家也好，都逐渐地执行这种撤退驻在别国的外国军队的政策。”
    据新华社布拉格24日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”23日报道，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在接见“红色权利报”特派记者普拉黑特卡的时候说，苏联最近关于中东的建议可以作为缓和中东紧张局势的政策的基础。
    比塔尔在谈话中重申反对联合国紧急部队占领加沙地区，并且谴责西方国家的立场，认为它是不公正的。
    在谈到叙利亚和黎巴嫩之间的关系时，比塔尔说，帝国主义正在用一切手段设法破坏阿拉伯国家的团结，唆使一国反对另一国。如果阿拉伯国家之间有时存在着紧张局势，人们总可以发现有帝国主义者在幕后指使。然而，人为的紧张局势还是进一步加强了阿拉伯国家人民的团结，这个事实“使我们对于在同黎巴嫩的关系方面所造成的局面也感到乐观”。
    比塔尔在谈到捷克斯洛伐克和叙利亚的关系时说，捷克斯洛伐克是我们的友好国家，它向我们提供了我们所需要的东西。
