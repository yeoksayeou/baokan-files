Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd -- The Ministry of Commerce's proposed measures for the market supply of steel materials in 1957 were approved by the State Council in early February, with instructions for all provinces, cities, and relevant departments to implement them conscientiously.

The Ministry of Commerce's proposed measures, after analyzing the chaotic situation of the steel materials market in 1956, prepare to adopt the following steel supply methods:

	One, the steel materials allocated by the state to the market are for the purpose of supplying daily necessities production and people's needs, and stabilizing market prices. Therefore, it is imperative to strictly prohibit basic construction and large factories and other applying units from indiscriminately seizing steel and its products from the market. In the future, commercial departments will not supply any applying units, except for the prescribed non-applying units.

	Two, in terms of supplying civilian use, we should also try to distinguish between the important and the urgent as much as possible. If steel can be avoided, it should be avoided. If it is optional, it should be avoided as much as possible (such as general civilian iron beds and iron chairs, and certain iron ball racks, parallel bars, single bars, dumbbells, and barbells for non-regular competitions). If scrap steel can be used, scrap steel should be used as much as possible (such as some cooking utensils and some small farm tools).

	Three, regarding the supply objects in the steel market, we must take into account the minimum needs of both handicraft production and daily necessities industrial production, overcoming the current phenomenon of supplying too little to handicraft production, in order to achieve: (1) handicraft production can be maintained, avoiding large-scale unemployment; (2) after having the minimum raw materials, handicrafts can reduce bidding up prices in the scrap steel market for purchases, so that the scrap steel market tends to stabilize; (3) supplying raw materials to handicrafts and recovering products can not only stabilize the organization of handicraft cooperatives, but also benefit commercial departments in organizing the source of goods for daily necessities. Of course, the country's overall steel shortage this year means that only the minimum needs can be supplied to handicrafts, and it is impossible to fully satisfy them, so as to take into account both handicraft production and daily necessities industrial production.

	Four, steel supply must first be used for the production of people's essential necessities, such as cooking utensils, heating appliances for the north, daily hardware, department stores, small tools, and small farm tools, so as to prioritize the supply of limited goods to the people's needs and stabilize people's livelihood. The need for raw materials that are not very related to stabilizing people's livelihood can be not supplied or supplied less. However, appropriate consideration should also be given to small hardware, wire nails, and iron wire for construction, as well as materials for scientific research and teaching experiments.

	Five, in order to implement the above supply methods in light of local conditions, please ask the People's Committees of each province and city to uniformly arrange the source of goods allocated to various places by the hardware companies under the Ministry of Commerce according to the above supply principles, formulate specific measures for the supply of steel materials to the market in their respective provinces and cities, and urge the relevant local departments to implement them.

### 国务院批准今年市场钢铁材料分配原则

    国务院批准今年市场钢铁材料分配原则
    新华社23日讯　商业部拟订的关于1957年钢铁材料市场供应办法，已于2月上旬经国务院批准，并指示各省市和有关部门认真实行。
    商业部拟订的办法中，在分析了1956年钢铁材料市场的混乱状况后，准备采取以下的钢铁供应办法：
    一、国家分配给市场的钢材，是为了供应日用品生产与人民需要，稳定市场物价，因此，必须严格禁止基本建设和大工厂等申请单位向市场乱抓钢铁及其制品。商业部门今后除供应规定的非申请单位外，对申请单位一律不供应。
    二、在供应民用方面，也应尽量分别轻重缓急，能不用钢铁的就不用，可用可不用的尽量不用（如一般民用的铁床铁椅，非正规比赛用的某些铁制的球架、双杠、单杠、哑铃、杠铃等），能用废旧钢铁的尽量用废旧钢铁（如一部分炊事用具，一部分小农具）。
    三、在钢铁市场的供应对象上，要兼顾手工业生产与日用品工业生产两方面最低限度的需要，克服目前对手工业生产供应过少的现象，以达到：（1）手工业生产能维持下来，避免发生大批失业；（2）使手工业在有了最低限度的原料以后，能减少在废旧钢铁市场抬价收购，使废旧钢铁市场趋于稳定；（3）供应手工业原料，收回产品，既可稳定手工业合作社的组织，也利于商业部门组织民用必需品的货源。当然，今年国家钢铁整个不足，对手工业只能供应最低的需要，不可能全部满足，以便兼顾到手工业生产和日用品工业生产两个方面。
    四、钢铁供应必须首先用于生产人民生活的必需品，如炊事用具、北方取暖用具、日用五金、百货、小工具、小农具等，以便把有限的货源优先地供应人民需要和稳定民生。对稳定民生关系不大的原料需要可以不供应或少供应。但对建筑用的小五金、洋钉、铅丝，以及科学研究、教学实验用的材料等，也应适当照顾。
    五、为了因地制宜地贯彻以上供应办法，请各省市人民委员会根据上述供应原则，对商业部所属五金公司分配给各地的货源统一安排，订出本省市钢铁材料市场供应的具体办法，督促当地有关部门执行。
