The Ishibashi Cabinet of Japan, born on December 23rd last year, was declared dead after only two months of life. The new cabinet, with Kishi Nobusuke as the successor prime minister, was formally formed on February 25th. With the exception of adding one minister without portfolio, the new cabinet is entirely composed of the original members of the former Ishibashi cabinet.

The ostensible reason for the resignation of the Ishibashi cabinet this time seems to be Ishibashi's illness, but in reality, it is a reflection of the deepening internal contradictions within the Japanese ruling class. The Ishibashi cabinet itself was originally a product of factional struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party. Kishi Nobusuke was the former secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party and has always had relatively strong power within the party. He is supported by Fujiyama Aiichiro, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Uemura Kogoro, vice chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, and other big capitalists in the fields of steel, petroleum, chemicals, and electrical industries. He represents the interests of the powerful factions of the Japanese business community. Compared with Kishi's power inside and outside the party, Ishibashi appeared weak. However, when Ishibashi and Kishi competed for the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party last December, Kishi lost to Ishibashi by seven votes. The reason for this was that the Yoshida faction, the Ishii faction, and others within the party who held different political views from the Ishibashi faction, in order to jointly resist the Kishi faction, did not hesitate to support Ishibashi. As a result, the Ishibashi cabinet, which included figures from various factions within the party, was born, with the Kishi faction still occupying an important position. Therefore, the birth of the Ishibashi cabinet was a product of factional struggles, and it ended up failing due to factional struggles. Ishibashi not only failed to ease the internal contradictions of the Japanese ruling class, but also made the contradictions more acute, to the point that he had to give way to Kishi.

Because the Kishi faction has relatively strong strength inside and outside the party, the Kishi cabinet itself may be more stable than the Ishibashi cabinet. But this does not mean that the factional struggles within the Japanese ruling class will also stabilize. At present, the factional struggles within the Japanese ruling class are the result of the mutual opposition and struggle between the factors dependent on the United States and the factors demanding to get rid of the United States in the process of Japan's economic development after the war. This struggle once converged in the face of the growing democratic forces in Japan after the war, and the unification of the conservative parties appeared. However, with the changes in the domestic and international situation in Japan in the past two years and the increase in Japan's production level (more than double the pre-war average), the factional struggles within the ruling class have become more intense again.

The possibility of dissolving the Diet and holding a general election, which is currently attracting national attention in Japan, has increased even more due to Ishibashi's resignation and Kishi's rise to power. Judging from the situation after Kishi's rise to power, it does not seem likely that the Diet will be dissolved and a general election will be held immediately, because influential figures in the business community unanimously demand that the current Diet pass the 1957 budget on schedule. However, after the budget for this year is passed, the possibility of dissolving the Diet and holding a general election will be greater. Dissolving the Diet and holding a general election is not only a demand of the Japanese democratic forces headed by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party; it is also a demand of various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party, all of whom want to take this opportunity to strengthen their own power within the party and the government. Even the currently ruling Kishi faction is attempting to use this to gain a dominant position in the party and then form the second Kishi cabinet. Although they see that once a general election is held, due to the continuous improvement of the Japanese people's awareness, the democratic forces will definitely develop, they believe that there are also factors that are beneficial to them, that is, the increase in industrial and mining production in Japan in the past two years, consecutive years of good harvests in rural areas, some improvement in the lives of ordinary people, and the crisis of overproduction will not break out for a while; in addition, the Ishibashi cabinet was established not long ago and did not have time to do many bad things, and it also conducted a lot of publicity among the general public about reducing taxes by 100 billion yen, expanding employment, and improving social insurance. Therefore, they believe that this year will be the best time for them to hold a general election. Generally speaking, this Kishi cabinet will still be a transitional cabinet.

From Ishibashi to Kishi, it also shows that the basic policies implemented by the current Japanese government will not change. Kishi himself was one of the decision-makers of the former Hatoyama cabinet. By the time of the Ishibashi cabinet, he still occupied an important position and served as acting prime minister for half the time. Therefore, from Hatoyama to Ishibashi, and from Ishibashi to Kishi, it does not indicate a change in Japan's basic policies. Recently, Kishi Nobusuke has repeatedly emphasized the importance of "Japan-U.S. cooperation"; after he came to power, he was immediately welcomed by the United States. However, the voice of the broad masses of the Japanese people demanding national independence is becoming louder and louder, and the tendency of the Japanese bourgeoisie, including some figures in the ruling group, to demand to get rid of the United States and develop independently is also becoming more and more obvious. The trend of popular sentiment is irresistible to any Japanese government.

### 从石桥湛山到岸信介

    从石桥湛山到岸信介
    去年12月23日诞生的日本石桥内阁，仅仅只有两个月的寿命便宣告夭折了。新的以岸信介为继任首相的内阁，已于2月25日正式组成。新内阁除增加一名无任所相以外，全是前石桥内阁的原班人马。
    这次石桥内阁的总辞职，表面上的理由似乎是石桥患病，实际上却是日本统治阶级内部矛盾深刻化的反映。石桥内阁本身，本来就是自由民主党内部派系斗争的产物。岸信介是自由民主党前任干事长，在党内一向有着比较雄厚的力量。他受到日本商工会议所会长藤山爱一郎、经济团体联合会副会长植村甲午郎以及其他钢铁、石油、化学、电气等重工业和化学工业方面大资本家的支持。他代表着日本财界当权派的利益。和岸在党内党外的力量比起来，石桥是显得薄弱的。但是去年12月石桥和岸竞选自由民主党总裁时，岸却以七票之差败于石桥。其原因就是党内和石桥派抱着不同政见的吉田派、石井派等，为了共同抵制岸派，不惜支持石桥。结果产生了包括党内各派人物的石桥内阁，其中岸派依旧占着重要的地位。因此石桥内阁的诞生，是派系斗争的产物，最后又因派系斗争而告终。石桥不仅没有缓和日本统治阶级内部的矛盾，反而使矛盾更为尖锐，以至最后不得不让位于岸。
    由于岸派在党内党外有比较强大的实力，岸内阁本身可能比石桥内阁稳定些。但是这并不说明日本统治阶级内部的派系斗争也将稳定下来。目前日本统治阶级内部的派系斗争，是战后日本经济发展过程中依赖美国的因素和要求摆脱美国的因素相互对立和相互斗争的结果。这一斗争在战后日本民主力量日益壮大的情况下，也曾一度收敛，出现了保守政党的统一。但是随着这两年来日本国内外情况的变化和日本生产水平的提高（超过战前平均水平一倍以上），统治阶级内部的派系斗争就又剧烈起来了。
    现在日本全国瞩目的解散国会、举行大选的可能性，已因石桥下台和岸登台而更为增加。根据岸上台后的情况来看，目前似不致立即解散国会，举行大选，因为实业界的有力人士一致要求本届国会按期通过1957年度预算。但是到本年度预算被通过以后，解散国会、举行大选的可能性就比较大了。解散国会、举行大选，不仅是以社会党、共产党为首的日本民主力量的要求；同时也是自由民主党内部各派系的要求，他们都想借此加强本身在党内和政府内的力量。即使以目前当权的岸派来说，也企图借此取得在党内占压倒地位的力量后组织第二次岸内阁。他们虽然看到一旦举行大选，由于日本人民觉悟程度的不断提高，民主力量一定将得到发展，但是他们认为也存在着有利于他们的因素，这就是两年来日本工矿业生产的上升，农村连续两年丰收，一般人民生活有某些改善，生产过剩的危机一时还不致爆发；加上石桥内阁成立不久，来不及做很多坏事，还在一般人民中进行了不少关于减税一千亿日元、扩大就业、提高社会保险等宣传。因此他们认为今年将是他们举行大选的最好时机。总的说来，这次岸内阁依然将是过渡性质的内阁。
    从石桥到岸，也说明目前日本政府执行的基本政策将不会改变。岸本人是过去鸠山内阁的决策人之一。到了石桥内阁，他依旧占着重要的地位，而且有一半时间担任代理首相。因此从鸠山到石桥，从石桥到岸，都并不表示日本基本政策的变化。最近岸信介曾一再强调“日美合作”的重要性；他登台以后，立即得到了美国的欢迎。但是，日本广大人民要求民族独立的呼声越来越高昂，日本资产阶级内部包括一部分统治集团的人物在内，要求摆脱美国、独立发展的倾向，也越来越明显。人心所向，大势所趋，这是任何日本政府都不能阻挠的。
