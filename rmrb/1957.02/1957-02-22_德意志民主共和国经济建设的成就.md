Achievements of Economic Construction in the German Democratic Republic
	 Cai Lei

The German Democratic Republic (GDR) is the first state in German history where workers and peasants hold power. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, it has achieved remarkable progress in developing the national economy and national culture.

The German Democratic Republic is a highly industrialized nation. The completion of the first Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) laid the foundation for building socialism. During the Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output value increased by 89.9%, more than doubling the pre-war 1936 level. In 1956, it further increased to 107% of 1955, reaching 202% of 1950. The proportion of socialist industry in the total industrial output value has increased from 77% in 1950 to 88.8% in 1956. At the end of the first Five-Year Plan, the German Democratic Republic's industry was able to produce products worth 45 billion marks annually, ranking fifth in Europe only after the Soviet Union, Britain, West Germany, and France; on an international scale, its industrial production ranked sixth. The following table compares the production of important industrial products of the German Democratic Republic in 1956 with the output in 1950 and 1955:

		 	1950	1955	1956
	Electricity (100 million kWh)	178	287	312
	Anthracite Coal (10,000 tons)	—	266.7	274.3
	Lignite (million tons)	132	200.6	205.9
	Steel (10,000 tons)	96.1	250.7	274
	Steel Products (10,000 tons)	73.5	190.7	203.6
	Pig Iron (10,000 tons)	33.5	151.7	157.4
	Cars (units)	—	22,200	27,300
	Lathes (tons)	—	27,400	37,300

Due to the division of Germany, the original heavy industrial base within the German Democratic Republic was very weak. However, in recent years, with the rapid development of heavy industry, especially the machine-building industry, the German Democratic Republic has been able to produce many complex machines and equipment, including complete sets of rolling mills, coal mines, chemical industrial equipment, the heaviest machine tools, heavy forging equipment, jet aircraft, and 10,000-ton ocean freighters. Currently, many of the German Democratic Republic's machinery, electrical engineering, and precision optical instrument products have reached international standards; many industrial products have a traditional international reputation. The chemical industry has also developed rapidly; for example, its plastics industry production ranks fourth in the world, after the United States, West Germany, and Britain, and many plastics have reached international standards.

In order to further develop the national economy, the German Democratic Republic attaches great importance to the development of science and technology. Adopting advanced technology and promoting mechanization and automation in all sectors of the national economy is one of the important tasks of the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). The German Democratic Republic's technical intellectuals are making unremitting efforts to achieve this task. As a result of adopting new technologies, labor productivity has significantly improved. The German Democratic Republic has also made great progress in the peaceful use of atomic energy; it possesses the richest uranium mines in Europe; it is currently building a modern nuclear physics research center, and by 1960, it will have completed the first nuclear power plant in Germany with a generating capacity of 70,000 kilowatts.

Due to technological development, the German Democratic Republic has been able to use lignite to produce coke and has established the world's first such factory—the Lauchhammer coking plant. Scientists have also established a low-shaft furnace factory to utilize acidic ore with very low iron content, which is also a pioneering achievement in the world.

The development of industrial production has made it possible for the German Democratic Republic to expand its foreign trade. It currently has trade relations with more than one hundred countries. The total trade volume in 1956 increased by 1.2 billion rubles compared to 1955; compared to 1950, imports increased by two times, and exports increased by two and a half times. Trade between the German Democratic Republic and the socialist camp countries accounts for about three-quarters of its total foreign trade. In recent years, it has actively expanded its economic relations with capitalist countries, especially Asian and African countries. It has signed trade agreements with the governments of Burma, India, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, and other countries. In 1956, the trade volume with India, Egypt, Syria, and other countries increased by about one to two times compared to 1955. The German Democratic Republic not only provides Asian and African countries with complete sets of industrial equipment but also sends experts to provide technical assistance, greatly supporting the efforts of Asian and African countries to establish and develop their own national industries.

In agriculture, the total output value of agriculture and forestry in 1956 increased by 1.2% compared to 1955. The number of agricultural production cooperatives increased from 6,047 to 6,281. The cultivated land of agricultural production cooperatives already accounts for 23.2% of the total cultivated land area (currently, individual small farmers occupy about 70% of all cultivated land). This year, 2,854 new tractors and many other agricultural machines were added. In 1956, the yield per unit area of ​​grain increased from 2,480 kilograms per hectare in 1955 to 2,520 kilograms per hectare.

The German Democratic Republic has also made achievements in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Since the government announced its decision on state investment in February 1956, investment contracts have been signed with 214 private enterprises, and many private companies have become joint state-private enterprises. By the end of January this year, 810 private enterprises had applied for state participation in investment.

Although the German Democratic Republic has achieved great successes in socialist construction, there are still some difficulties and problems. Among them, the main problems are the shortage of raw materials caused by the division of East and West Germany, especially the shortage of coal and steel production (the area belonging to the German Democratic Republic today produced only about 2.6% of German hard coal in 1936, and 17% of metal production, of which steel production accounted for about 8%, so basic raw material production was mainly in West Germany); agricultural production cannot meet the needs of industrial development. To overcome this imbalance, the German Democratic Republic has made great efforts. In 1955, its lignite mining volume increased by more than double that of 1936, reaching 200 million tons, accounting for 45% of the world's total lignite production and ranking first in the world; pig iron production increased by more than six times that of 1936, and steel production increased by one times. Even so, it still cannot fully meet the growing needs today. In order to further reduce the above-mentioned disproportionate phenomenon, the production of means of production industries will be vigorously developed in the second Five-Year Plan. The plan stipulates that by 1960, electricity production will increase by 153% compared to 1955, reaching 44 billion kWh; lignite will increase by 130%, reaching 260 million tons; steel production will increase by 140%, reaching 3.5 million tons; pig iron production will increase by 148%, reaching 2.25 million tons.

With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the material and cultural life of the working people has been continuously improved. During the first Five-Year Plan, national income increased by 62%. The average monthly nominal wage of workers increased from 262 marks in 1950 to 383 marks in 1955, and the average wage of employees increased by another 3% in 1956. The number of workers in state-owned industrial production increased by 12,400. In 1956, the seventeenth price reduction was implemented, increasing the purchasing power of residents by 1.5 billion marks annually. The following are the price reductions for several commodities: (Unit: Marks)

		 	1950	1956
	White Bread (1 kg)	4.0	1.0
	Refined Sugar (1 kg)	12.0	3.0
	Pork (1 kg)	30.0	11.2
	Butter (1 kg)	40.0	20.0
	Eggs (each)	1.2	0.45

From December 1956, the German Democratic Republic increased pensions (including old-age pensions, survivor's pensions, etc.), for which the government increased expenditure by more than 1 billion marks annually. Starting this year, a 45-hour work week has been implemented in some factories.

The German Democratic Republic attaches great importance to the education and training of young people. In 1956, the government's expenditure on youth training and the development of sports reached 2.6 billion marks. In 1956, the number of secondary schools increased from 491 in 1952 to 830. During the same period, the number of universities and colleges increased from 24 to 46. In 1956, 10,389 college graduates were assigned to production departments; the total number of students enrolled in colleges and universities this year reached 80,526, an increase of 5,784 compared to 1955.

The economic development and improvement of people's living standards in the German Democratic Republic are inseparable from the strengthening and expansion of economic cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp. In particular, the large amount of assistance provided by the Soviet Union is a decisive condition for the German Democratic Republic to carry out socialist construction. The raw materials, semi-finished products, and grain imported from the Soviet Union are of great significance for balancing the national economy of the German Democratic Republic. During the recent talks between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union decided to provide the German Democratic Republic with economic assistance totaling approximately 7.5 billion rubles between 1957 and 1960. The Soviet government will also lend the German Democratic Republic a total of 340 million rubles in free foreign exchange this year for the purchase of commodities necessary for the national economy of the German Democratic Republic.

The brilliant economic achievements of the German Democratic Republic eloquently prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist economic system. Because of these achievements, its international prestige and status have been greatly improved. Today, the influence and rights that the German Democratic Republic has in international affairs cannot be ignored. The West German and imperialist monopoly capital groups' attempts to economically and politically isolate and obstruct the development of the German Democratic Republic are also doomed to failure. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the people of the German Democratic Republic will continue to advance victoriously on the road of socialist construction, defending European peace, and striving for the reunification of their motherland on a peaceful and democratic basis.

    德意志民主共和国经济建设的成就
    蔡磊
    德意志民主共和国是德国历史上第一个由工人和农民掌握政权的国家。几年来，在德国统一社会党的领导下，在发展国民经济和民族文化方面获得了日新月异的成就。
    德意志民主共和国是一个工业高度发达的国家。第一个五年计划（1951—1955）的完成使它奠定了建立社会主义的基础。在五年计划期间，工业生产总值增长了89.9％，达到战前1936年水平的一倍以上。1956年又增为1955年的107％，达到1950年的202％。社会主义工业在全部工业总产值中的比重已经从1950年的77％增加到1956年的88.8％。在第一个五年计划结束时德意志民主共和国的工业每年已能够生产价值四百五十亿马克的产品，在欧洲仅次于苏联、英国、西德和法国而居第五位；在国际规模上，工业生产占第六位。1956年德意志民主共和国工业的重要产品同1950、1955年产量比较如下：
                  1950　1955　1956
    电力　（亿度）178　287　312
    原煤　（万吨）——　266.7　274.3
    褐煤（百万吨）132　200.6　205.9
    钢　（万吨）96.1　250.7　274
    钢材　（万吨）73.5　190.7　203.6
    生铁　（万吨）33.5　151.7　157.4
    小汽车（辆）——　22，200　27，300
    车床　（吨）——　27，400　37，300
    由于德国的分裂，德意志民主共和国境内原来的重工业基础是很薄弱的。但是，几年来，在重工业特别是机器制造工业得到迅速发展以后，德意志民主共和国已能生产许多复杂的机器和装备，包括全套的轧钢厂、煤矿、化学等工业设备、最重型的工作母机、重型锻压设备、喷气式飞机和万吨的远洋货轮等。目前德意志民主共和国的许多机械、电工和精密光学仪器产品已达到国际水平；许多工业产品具有传统的国际声誉。在化学工业方面也得到迅速的发展，例如它的塑料工业的生产量已占世界第四位，仅次于美国、西德和英国，许多塑料并已达到国际水平。
    为了进一步发展国民经济，德意志民主共和国十分重视科学和技术的发展。在国民经济各部门中采用先进技术，推行机械化和自动化是第二个五年计划（1956—1960）的重要任务之一。德意志民主共和国的技术知识分子正为实现这一任务进行着不懈的努力。由于采用新技术的结果，劳动生产率获得显著的提高。德意志民主共和国在和平利用原子能的工作方面，也有很大进展，它拥有欧洲最丰富的铀矿；目前正在建设一个现代化的核子物理研究中心，在1960年以前并将建成德国第一座发电能力达七万瓩的原子能发电站。
    由于技术的发展，德意志民主共和国已能利用褐煤制造焦炭，并建立了世界上第一个这样的工厂——劳赫汗麦尔炼焦厂。科学家们为了利用含铁量很低的酸性矿，建立了低平炉工厂，这在世界上也是创举。
    工业生产的发展使德意志民主共和国有可能扩大它的对外贸易。它目前同一百多个国家建立了贸易关系。1956年的贸易总额比1955年增加了十二亿卢布；同1950年相比，进口增加了两倍，出口增加了两倍半。德意志民主共和国同社会主义阵营各国的贸易约占它对外贸易总额的四分之三。几年来它积极地扩大同资本主义国家特别是亚非国家的经济关系。它已同缅甸、印度、埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、苏丹等国政府签订了贸易协定。1956年同印度、埃及、叙利亚等国的贸易额比1955年增加了约一倍到两倍。德意志民主共和国不仅提供亚非国家全套的工业装备而且还派遣专家，给予技术援助，大大地支持了亚非国家建立和发展自己民族工业的努力。
    在农业方面，1956年农林业的总产值比1955年增加了1.2％。农业生产合作社的数量由六千零四十七个增加到六千二百八十一个。农业生产合作社的耕地已经占耕地总面积的23.2％（目前个体小农占有的耕地面积占全部耕地的70％左右）。这一年新增加了二千八百五十四台拖拉机和许多其他农业机器。1956年谷物的单位面积产量已由1955年每公顷二千四百八十公斤增加到二千五百二十公斤。
    德意志民主共和国在改造资本主义工商业的工作中也取得了成就。自从1956年2月政府公布关于国家投资的决定以来，已经同二百一十四家私营企业订立了投资合同，许多私营公司已成为公私合营。到今年1月底，已经有八百一十家私营企业申请国家参加投资。
    德意志民主共和国在社会主义的建设中虽然获得了巨大的成就，但是仍然存在着一些困难和问题。其中主要是由于东西德分裂而引起的原料不足，特别是煤和钢的生产不足（今天属于德意志民主共和国的地区在1936年时大约只生产德国硬煤的2.6％，金属产量的17％，其中钢铁产量约占8％，因此基本原料生产主要在西德）；农业生产不能满足工业发展的需要。为了克服这种不均衡的现象，德意志民主共和国进行了巨大的努力。1955年它的褐煤开采量比1936年增加了一倍多，达到二亿吨，占世界全部褐煤生产的45％而居世界第一位；生铁产量比1936年增加了六倍多，钢的产量增加了一倍。虽然如此，今天仍不能充分满足日益增长的需要。为了进一步缩小上述比例失调的现象，在第二个五年计划中将大力发展生产资料工业。计划规定到1960年电力生产将比1955年增加153％，达到四百四十亿度；褐煤增加130％，达到二亿六千万吨；钢产量增加140％，达到三百五十万吨；生铁产量增加148％，达二百二十五万吨。
    随着工农业生产的发展，劳动人民的物质文化生活获得了不断的提高。第一个五年计划期间，国民收入增加了62％。工人每月平均名义工资由1950年的二百六十二马克提高到1955年的三百八十三马克，1956年职工平均工资又增加了3％。国营工业生产工人增加一万二千四百人。1956年实行了第十七次降低物价，使居民的购买力每年增加十五亿马克。以下是几种商品降低价格的情况：（单位：马克）
                   1950　1956
    白面包（1公斤）　4.0　1.0
    精炼糖（1公斤）　12.0　3.0
    猪肉（1公斤）　30.0　11.2
    牛油（1公斤）　40.0　20.0
    鸡蛋（个）　1.2　0.45
    从1956年12月起，德意志民主共和国提高了年金（包括养老金、抚恤金等），政府为此每年增加支出十亿多马克。从今年起已在一些工厂中实行每周四十五小时工作制。
    德意志民主共和国十分重视对青年的教育和培养工作，1956年政府在青年培养工作和发展体育运动方面的开支达二十六亿马克。1956年中等学校由1952年的四百九十一所增为八百三十所，同一时期，大学和高等学校由二十四所增为四十六所。1956年分配到生产部门中去的高等学校毕业生有一万零三百八十九名；这一年高等学校在校学生总数达八万零五百二十六名，比1955年增加了五千七百八十四名。
    德意志民主共和国经济的发展和人民生活的改善同社会主义阵营各国间经济合作的加强和扩大是分不开的。特别是苏联所给予的大量援助是德意志民主共和国进行社会主义建设的决定条件。从苏联进口的原料、半成品和粮食对德意志民主共和国国民经济的平衡具有重要的意义。在不久以前举行的苏联和德意志民主共和国会谈中，苏联决定在1957年到1960年期间供给德意志民主共和国总数约七十五亿卢布的经济援助。苏联政府并将在今年贷给德意志民主共和国总数为三亿四千万卢布的自由外汇，用作购买德意志民主共和国国民经济必需的商品。
    德意志民主共和国经济上取得的辉煌成就，雄辩地证明了社会主义经济制度的无比优越性。由于它所取得的这些成就，大大提高了它的国际威信和地位。今天德意志民主共和国在国际事务中具有的影响和它所应有的权利是不可抹杀的。西德和帝国主义的垄断资本集团企图从经济上和政治上孤立和阻挠德意志民主共和国发展的妄想也是必然要失败的。德意志民主共和国人民在德国统一社会党的领导下，将在社会主义建设、保卫欧洲和平、争取在和平民主基础上统一自己祖国的道路上继续胜利前进。
