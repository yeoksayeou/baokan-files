    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 12th: Egyptian President Nasser said on the 11th, "We will strive to stabilize Arab nationalism."

    He told a delegation of professors and students from Syria at the Presidential Palace that there were two paths before them. "Our path is the path of freedom and independence." "The easy path is to follow behind the great powers, to be a weak country, defeated by the imperialists who are currently trying to divide and destroy our unity."

    He pointed out, "They will not succeed, because the Arab countries are united, strong, and, despite imperialism, Arab nationalism is expanding from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf."

    Nasser said that the Arab nationalism we believe in is common interests, common security, and common resistance to aggressors. The purpose of Arab nationalism is to enhance the common interests of Arab countries. "We are all working for this nationalism, against imperialists and aggressors, who are fighting against this nationalism, doing everything they can to crush it."

    Nasser said that imperialism is currently trying to extinguish the torch of Arab nationalism. "Imperialism mobilized its troops to invade Egypt, thinking that it was facing a weak nation; but they were greatly surprised when Arab nationalism was ready to stand up, threaten them, and strive to crush their interests."

    Nasser said that Egypt's demand for Arab nationalism "is because it firmly believes in nationalism, which is the guarantee for Egypt, Syria, and all other Arab countries, preventing them from falling into the conspiracies manipulated by imperialism to control our countries."

    Speaking of the unity of Arab countries, Nasser said that Egypt firmly believes that when the Arab world is not united, it will easily suffer from aggressors and investors; but when the Arab countries are closely united, they can defeat the most powerful countries in the world.

    He said to the Syrian guests: "Compatriots, if today the supporters of the imperialists advocate imperialism and advocate stabilizing imperialism, they cannot even express their opinions, because the Arab people are watching them. If those who support isolation, division, and imperialism attempt to sow seeds of discord among the brothers of the single Arab nation, they will not succeed, because we are all descendants of the single Arab nation."

    纳赛尔强调保持阿拉伯国家的团结
    粉碎帝国主义者分裂和挑拨阴谋
    据新华社开罗12日电　埃及总统纳赛尔11日说，“我们将为稳定阿拉伯民族主义而奋斗。”
    他在总统府对叙利亚的由教授和学生组成的代表团说，面前摆着两条道路。“我们的道路是自由和独立的道路。”“容易的道路是跟在大国的后面走，做一个弱国，被目前设法分裂和破坏我们的团结的帝国主义击败”。
    他指出，“他们是不会得逞的，因为阿拉伯国家是团结的，强有力的，而且，尽管有帝国主义，阿拉伯民族主义还是正在从大西洋扩展到波斯湾。”
    纳赛尔说，我们所坚信的阿拉伯民族主义，就是共同的利益，共同的安全和共同抵御侵略者。阿拉伯民族主义的目的在于增进阿拉伯国家的共同利益。“我们大家都在为这种民族主义进行努力，反对帝国主义者和侵略者，而他们正在向这种民族主义进行斗争，尽一切力量要把它粉碎”。
    纳赛尔说，帝国主义目前正在设法扑灭阿拉伯民族主义的火炬。“帝国主义动员他们的军队来侵略埃及，以为在他们面前的是一个弱小民族；但是当阿拉伯民族主义准备好站起来，威胁他们，并且努力粉碎他们的利益的时候，他们却大吃一惊。”
    纳赛尔说，埃及所以要求阿拉伯民族主义，“是因为它深深相信民族主义，民族主义是埃及、叙利亚和其他一切阿拉伯国家的保障，使它们不至于坠入帝国主义为了控制我们各国而玩弄的阴谋。”
    纳赛尔在谈到阿拉伯国家的团结时说，埃及深信，当阿拉伯世界不团结的时候，它就会很容易遭受侵略者和投资者之害；而当阿拉伯国家紧密地团结起来的时候，它们就可以战胜世界上最强大的国家。
    他对叙利亚客人说：“同胞们，如果今天帝国主义者的支持者主张搞帝国主义，主张稳定帝国主义，他们甚至连表达自己的意见也不可能，因为阿拉伯人民正在注视着他们。如果那些支持孤立、分裂和帝国主义的人企图在单一的阿拉伯民族的兄弟中间散布不和的种子，他们是不会成功的，因为我们都是单一的阿拉伯民族的子孙。”
