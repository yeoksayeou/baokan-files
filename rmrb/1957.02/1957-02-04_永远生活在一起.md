    Living Together Forever
            By Our Correspondent, Dian Yi
    On the evening of the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, the Communist Youth League Central Committee's Guandongdian dormitory held a Spring Festival film night, inviting residents from the neighborhood.
    As night fell, the dormitory gate was brightly lit, and the snow in the courtyard shone brilliantly, with scattered firecracker paper scraps. Cadres, having eaten their meals, were neatly dressed and joyfully stood at the gate to welcome guests.
    The guests were invited to sit in the south room. The south room, originally the dormitory canteen, was temporarily "transformed" into a medium-sized screening hall. Four palace lanterns hung from the roof, covered with bright red "囍" (double happiness) characters, decorating the room with an antique flavor. The potted plants and blooming winter jasmine on the windowsill made people feel that warm spring had already arrived.
    As the film night began, the little neighbors, who had been chattering like sparrows, quietly sat down. The screen showed a long train crossing the sea dike, a documentary about the completion of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway one year ahead of schedule. In this magnificent scene, the cameraman captured two touching shots: one of a centenarian presenting a bouquet of flowers to the railway construction heroes, and the other of the railway construction troop representative presenting a section of steel rail to the oldest person in Xiamen. Subsequently, the film "Heroes of Lüliang" was shown, an epic recounting the heroic deeds of the Eighth Route Army and the people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, fighting a guerrilla war against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. Anyone who has experienced this period will never forget the arduous years of fighting alongside the people, a past that is forever worthy of recollection.
    The film traced back to the day the Party was established, when Party cadres, the people's soldiers, and the common people were as close as one family. Cadres and the army went wherever they lived, the elderly treated the cadres as their own children, and the children treated the cadres as their older brothers and sisters. This friendship and affection grew with shared experiences and memories. Enemies and difficulties appeared so small and insignificant in its face.
    After the victory of the revolution, national cadres still could not forget their relatives. To maintain close ties with the masses, the Communist Youth League Central Committee invited staff from the office and neighborhood committees and residents near the dormitory to a forum before the Spring Festival to listen to their opinions on the office and dormitory. Comrade Lu Zhao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, and Comrade Chen Ting, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, personally attended this forum. The opinions raised at the forum were printed into a document for the cadres to read.
    On the morning of the second day of the Lunar New Year, cadres from all the dormitories of the Communist Youth League Central Committee launched activities to extend New Year greetings to the nearby neighbors. Comrade Li Bingning, who lived in the Beijige dormitory, originally planned to see the film "Shangganling" that morning, but he voluntarily gave up seeing the film when he heard that he was going to extend New Year greetings to the residents. Cadres living in the Guandongdian dormitory decided to invite the neighbors to the dormitory to watch a movie on the evening of the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, in addition to extending New Year greetings to the residents. The cadres were warmly received wherever they went to extend New Year greetings. Tian Dama, who lived near Guandongdian, was chatting with her son and daughter at home on the morning of the second day of the Lunar New Year when the New Year visitors arrived. Tian Dama's youngest daughter, a member of the Communist Youth League, happily took out sweets to treat the guests from the Communist Youth League Central Committee. Tian Dama repeatedly urged the cadres who were extending New Year greetings to sit for a while, saying, "You are all my good children. You are usually busy with work, and it is rare to see you. How can you leave as soon as you arrive during the New Year?"
    No matter how one describes the close friendship between the people and the Party's cadres, it is not an exaggeration. The New Year greetings have been paid, and the film night has ended, but this flesh-and-blood relationship between cadres and the masses will continue forever.

    永远生活在一起
            本报记者　甸义
    年初四晚上，团中央机关的关东店宿舍里，举行了春节电影晚会，招待附近的居民们。
    入夜，宿舍大门里灯火辉煌，庭院里的积雪也被射得灿灿发光，雪里还有不少零散的爆竹纸屑。干部们吃过饭，都穿得整整齐齐，喜气洋洋地站在门口迎接客人。
    客人们都被请到南房坐。南房本来是宿舍的食堂，临时“改建”成中型的放映厅。房上垂下四盏宫灯，上边贴满鲜红的喜字，把屋子里点缀得古色古香。窗台上摆着的盆景和盛开着的迎春花，又使人感到温暖的春天已经降临人间。
    晚会开始了，吵得像小麻雀似的小街坊们才安静地坐下来。银幕上出现了一列长长的火车穿过海堤，这是鹰厦铁路提前一年通车的纪录新闻。摄影师在这雄伟的场面里，摄下两个动人的镜头，一个是百多岁的老人把一捧鲜花献给筑路英雄们，一个是筑路部队代表把一节钢轨赠给厦门市最年长的人。随后开始放映“吕梁英雄传”电影，这是记述抗日战争时期，八路军和老百姓在共产党领导下，对敌展开游击战的一部可歌可泣的史诗。经历过这一时期的人，谁也不会忘记和人民共同奋斗的艰苦岁月，这是永远值得人们回味的过去。
    电影使人一直追溯到党建立的那天，党的干部、人民的子弟兵和老百姓就亲如一家人。干部和军队走到哪里住到哪里，老年人把干部当作自己的孩子，孩子们把干部当成他们的哥哥姐姐。这种友谊和情感随着共同的经历和回忆在不断增长。敌人和困难在它面前显得那末渺小和不足道。
    革命胜利了，国家干部还是不能忘怀自己的亲人。为了保持同人民群众的亲密关系，团中央机关在春节前，曾邀请了机关和宿舍附近的街道工作人员和居民委员开座谈会，听取他们对机关和宿舍的意见。团中央副秘书长鲁钊同志和党委副书记陈挺同志都亲自参加了这个座谈会。座谈会上提出的意见被打印成文件给干部们看。
    初二的早上，团中央各宿舍的干部都展开了给附近街坊拜年的活动。住在北极阁宿舍的黎秉宁同志本来打算这天上午去看“上甘岭”电影，他听说要给居民拜年就主动地不看电影了。住在关东店宿舍的干部除了给居民拜年外，还决定初四晚上请街坊们到宿舍里看电影。干部们到谁家拜年都受到热情的招待。住在关东店附近的田大妈，初二上午正在家里和儿子、女儿聊天，拜年的人来了。田大妈的小女儿是个青年团员，她高兴地取出糖果招待团中央来的客人。田大妈一再挽留拜年的干部多坐一会儿，她说：“你们也都是我的好孩子，平时工作忙，难得见一面，过年了怎能来了就走。”
    人民和党的干部之间的亲密情谊，无论怎样形容都不算过分的。年拜过了，电影晚会散了，但是干部和群众之间这种血肉般的关系是永远要继续下去的。
