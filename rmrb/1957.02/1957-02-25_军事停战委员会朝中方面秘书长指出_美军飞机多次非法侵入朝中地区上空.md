    军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长指出
    美军飞机多次非法侵入朝中地区上空
    新华社平壤24日电　开城消息：在23日举行的军事停战委员会秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长指出了最近美方军用飞机违反停战协定侵入朝中方面地区上空和军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团所在地——开城上空的许多事实。朝中方面就这些事实提起美方注意，并且要求美方进行调查，根据停战协定的规定采取相应的措施。
    最近美方军用飞机侵入朝中方面地区上空的例子有：2月12日白天，美方军用飞机两架飞越汉江进入开城上空，在开城城北松岳山上空盘旋一周后飞走。第二天，又有美方军用喷气式飞机三架侵入松岳山上空。仅在去年12月5日一天内就有美方军用飞机四架分四次分别侵入朝中方面地区内的开城、土城、平康、金谷等地。开城等地人民都曾经看到这些美方军用飞机违反停战协定的事实。
