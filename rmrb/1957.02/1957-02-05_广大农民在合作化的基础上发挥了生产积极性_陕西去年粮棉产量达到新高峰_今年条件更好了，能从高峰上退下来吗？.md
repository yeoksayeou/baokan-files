    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd - Xinhua News Agency reporter Duan Xuetai reports: Shaanxi Province achieved great victory on the agricultural front last year. According to preliminary statistics: last year the province produced more than 10.86 billion catties of grain and more than 1.99 million dan of cotton, both exceeding the province's previous historical high in 1954; the output of other products such as tea, silkworm cocoons, and fruits also increased compared with the past.
    The income of agricultural cooperative members also increased significantly last year. In the more than 21,000 agricultural cooperatives in the Qin Chuan area, nearly 80% of farmers' households had higher incomes than in 1955. Although southern and northern Shaanxi suffered from disasters such as hail, frost, and floods, many agricultural cooperatives have actively developed sideline production since the beginning of winter to make up for the losses caused by agricultural production disasters. After the Liuba County agricultural cooperatives vigorously developed winter sideline production, the number of households with increased production rose from 56% in the autumn to 80%, and the number of households with reduced production dropped from 34% to 16%.
    From the beginning of last year, the farmers of Shaanxi Province were involved in a production upsurge to strive for the first bumper harvest year after agricultural cooperation. Under the slogan of "thousands of carts and ten thousands of dan" of fertilizer accumulation, the province accumulated more than 180 billion catties of fertilizer in the first half of last year alone, exceeding the annual fertilizer accumulation of any previous year. The drought in the southern Shaanxi area in the spring, the frost, hail, and drought in Suide, Mizhi, and other counties in northern Shaanxi in April and May, and the cotton insect pests in the Qin Chuan area in June and July were all greatly reduced in severity or basically brought under control through the tenacious struggle of the local agricultural cooperatives. In terms of improving cultivation techniques and cultivation systems, in the past, farmers in the Hanzhong area of southern Shaanxi had insufficient labor and animal power, and could not promote the new method of soaking fields, but last year some agricultural cooperatives coordinated the timing of water release and arranged labor and animal power, so that the area using the new method of soaking fields reached more than 250,000 mu. According to surveys, the new method of soaking fields can increase production by about 7% compared to the old method. In the past, farmers in the Jinghui and Luohui state-owned large canal irrigation areas in the Qin Chuan area were also restricted by labor and financial resources, and rarely promoted the method of furrow irrigation, but last year, after agricultural cooperation, the area of cotton and corn irrigated by furrow increased by more than two times compared with 1955. After the summer harvest last year, the agricultural cooperatives in the Qin Chuan area not only smoothly completed the work of threshing and cotton field management due to the reasonable organization and allocation of labor and animal power, but also created a record of replanting more than 2 million mu of autumn fields. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have adopted a series of agricultural technical measures to increase the yield per unit area of crops. Last year, the irrigation area of state-owned large canals in the province expanded from more than 2.2 million mu in 1955 to more than 2.8 million mu. The dense planting area of wheat, cotton, and rice in the province reached 70% to 80% of the total sown area, and the phenomenon of sparse seedling retention in corn has also been changed in many areas. In addition to continuing to expand the planting area of high-quality wheat and cotton varieties such as Bima No. 1 wheat and Jingsi cotton, Shaanxi Province has also begun to ব্যাপকভাবে推广水稻和玉米良种。去年水稻和玉米良种的播种面积比1955年增加了二十倍到三十倍。Last year, the sowing area of high-quality rice and corn varieties increased by 20 to 30 times compared with 1955. Last year, the province promoted nearly 60,000 double-wheel double-share plows and single-share plows, and more than 11,000 other new-style agricultural tools. In addition, after agricultural cooperation, the labor efficiency and labor utilization rate of farmers have also been greatly improved. The liberation of female labor has been particularly prominent. In the past, women in the Qin Chuan area rarely went to the fields to produce, but last year women have been responsible for 30% of the farm work. The management of cotton fields, from thinning seedlings to harvesting, almost all activities were contracted by women.

    广大农民在合作化的基础上发挥了生产积极性
    陕西去年粮棉产量达到新高峰
    今年条件更好了，能从高峰上退下来吗？
    新华社西安3日电　新华社记者段学泰报道：陕西省去年在农业战线上获得很大胜利。据初步统计：去年全省共产粮食一百零八亿六千多万斤，棉花一百九十九万多担，都超过了这个省过去历史上产量最高的1954年；其他如茶叶、蚕茧和果品等的产量也都比过去有所增加。
    去年农业社社员的收入也比往年显著增加。秦川地区的两万一千多个农业社中，有近80％的农户收入比1955年增加。陕南、陕北地区虽然遭受冰雹、霜冻和洪水等危害，但是入冬以来许多农业社积极开展副业生产，以弥补农业生产受灾的损失。留坝县农业社在大力开展冬季副业生产以后，增产户已经由秋季的56％上升到80％，减产户已经由34％下降到16％。
    从去年年初起，陕西省农民就卷入争取农业合作化后第一个大丰收年的生产热潮。在“千车万担”的积肥口号下，全省仅去年上半年就积肥一千八百多亿斤，超过以往任何一年的全年积肥量。春季陕南地区的干旱，四、五月间陕北地区绥德、米脂等县的霜、雹和干旱，六、七月间秦川地区的棉花虫害等，都在当地农业社的顽强斗争下大大减轻了危害的程度或基本上受到了制止。在改进耕作技术和耕作制度方面，陕南地区的汉中专区过去农民劳动力和畜力不足，无法推行新法泡田，而去年一些农业社配合放水时间，安排好劳动力和畜力，使采用新法泡田的面积达到二十五万多亩。据调查，新法泡田比旧法泡田能够增产7％左右。秦川地区的泾惠、洛惠等国营大型渠道灌区，过去农民也受到劳动力和财力条件的限制，很少推行沟灌的方法，而去年农业合作化后，开沟灌溉棉花、玉米的面积比1955年增加了两倍多。秦川地区农业社在去年夏收以后，由于合理地组织和调配劳动力和畜力，不仅顺利地完成了打场、棉田管理等工作，而且创造了复种秋田两百多万亩的纪录。各地农业社为提高农作物的单位面积产量，采取了一系列的农业技术措施。去年全省国营大型渠道的灌溉面积从1955年的两百二十多万亩扩大到两百八十多万亩。全省小麦、棉花、水稻的密植面积达到播种总面积的70％到80％，玉米也在不少地区改变了留苗过稀的现象。陕西省除继续扩大碧蚂一号小麦、泾斯棉等麦、棉良种的播种面积外，并且开始大量推广水稻和玉米良种。去年水稻和玉米良种的播种面积比1955年增加了二十倍到三十倍。去年全省推广双轮双铧犁、单铧犁近六万部，其他新式农具一万一千多件。此外，农业合作化以后，农民的劳动效率和劳动利用率也大大提高了。特别是妇女劳动力的解放，表现得十分突出。秦川地区的妇女过去很少下地生产，而在去年已经有30％的农活由妇女担任。棉田管理工作从间苗到收获一系列的活动，几乎全部由妇女包了下来。
