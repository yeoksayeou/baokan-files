    For the People's Joyous Spring Festival
        Xinhua News Agency Collective Writing
    During the Spring Festival, the whole nation rejoices. While people happily reunite with their loved ones on New Year's Eve, toasting each other and staying up late, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army brave the wind and cold, ride the waves, and even stand guard amidst the sounds of battle, defending the borders, coasts, and interiors of our great motherland, patrolling the skies and seas. They safeguard the happiness and joy of the people throughout the country with their hard work.
        Defenders of the Capital
    On New Year's Eve, the people of the capital celebrated throughout the night. The soldiers guarding the capital braved the cold wind and remained at their posts.
    In the deep of night, public security soldiers on patrol walked lightly through every street and alley. Their bodies were covered with silvery frost as they paced back and forth until the golden dawn painted Tiananmen Square. These soldiers regarded the joy of the people of the capital as their own and considered guarding the capital and its people their greatest honor.湯开政, a young soldier who had only been in the army for a little over a year, guarding Tiananmen Square, wrote in his diary: "Tiananmen, you are the center of the motherland, Chairman Mao's reviewing stand. I will dedicate everything to loyally defend you!" Before the Spring Festival, he even took a picture in front of Tiananmen and sent it to his mother.
    At an air force base near the capital, air and ground crews cleaned the snow from the runway on New Year's Eve and made all preparations for takeoff. At night, the pilots waiting in the lounge remained fully dressed, ready to enter the cockpit at any time. They have been spending New Year's Eve at the airbase like this for several years.
    That night, there were also artillerymen of the anti-aircraft artillery units guarding near the capital. They also happily polished their cannons until they gleamed, vigilantly monitoring the skies over the capital.
        Coastal Sentries
    On New Year's Eve, the front lines in Fujian were experiencing a Force 7 gale. The soldiers guarding the forward outposts of the coast sometimes couldn't help but shiver in the cold wind, as dust and sand whipped against their faces. Liu Qunyi, a sentry who had spent four New Year's Eves here, told reporters, "At this time, the people throughout the country must be so happy! Every festival, we are here. Don't think life is a bit hard, but when we think of the people's happiness and joy, we can't help but be delighted!"
    Late at night, in an artillery observation post, Wang Chunming, a twenty-four-year-old young observer, pressed his eyes tightly to the telescope, concentrating on searching for enemy activity at sea and on Jinmen Island. This is a soldier worthy of the people's pride. A few days ago, Wang Chunming received letters from his mother and fiancée, asking him to take leave to go home for the Spring Festival and get married. Wang Chunming looked at the letter again and again, and the thoughts of his mother and the deep love for his fiancée whom he had been separated from for six years welled up in his heart. How he wished he could take leave to go home for the Spring Festival! However, he finally decided not to take leave. He wrote in his letter to his mother and fiancée: "It would of course be the happiness and joy of our whole family for me to go home for the festival and get married, but I am a soldier of the motherland's people. In order to protect the people of the whole country so they can have a good Spring Festival, how can I go home at this time!"
      Soldiers Defending Angang
    On New Year's Eve in Angang, molten steel and molten iron flowed as usual. Workers continued to produce for the motherland during the festival. Soldiers stood guard vigilantly at their posts. Some stood on the snow-covered mountains around Angang, some stood in the factory's oil depot and main power room, or patrolled beside blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. Song Guishuang, a soldier guarding in front of an iron-smelting furnace, told reporters frankly: "Seven years ago, when I first performed the task of protecting the iron-smelting plant, there were weeds everywhere, and only one iron-smelting furnace could produce pig iron; but now, rows of blast furnace clusters have been built here, how much wealth can it create for the motherland in a day! We love Angang, and we must protect its safe production at all times."
    That night, the soldiers stood guard for Angang all night long in smoke and cold wind without sleeping. As soon as soldier Xin Desheng returned from patrol, Liu Shiyou took over the patrol shift. These two young soldiers who had only been in the army for two years were recently selected as duty experts. Liu Shiyou is from Guizhou. Before joining the army, he loved this iron and steel base of the motherland and hoped that he could become a builder or defender of Angang. Therefore, when he joined the army and became a soldier defending Angang, how excited and loyal he was to his duties! Over the past two years, he has excellently completed his guard duties. Soldier Xin Desheng is familiar with every sound and operating condition of the machine he guards. In the past six months, he has helped workers eliminate thirty possible accidents, ensuring safe production.
      Patrolling in the Sky and Sea
    Before the Spring Festival, a tense atmosphere of preparedness for war pervaded an airbase on the coastal front. Ground crews busily wiped down warplanes, refueling and replenishing oxygen, and pilots eagerly awaited orders to take off.
    "Enter first-level readiness!" The command issued an order.
    At this time, commander Zhao Liancheng immediately saw a Chiang Kai-shek plane taking off from Taiwan, reflected on the radar screen, rushing towards the mainland. Navigator Jiang Tao quickly measured the enemy plane's speed. Our warplanes took off.
    The warplanes flew high into the sky, drilled into the clouds, and went to meet the enemy plane.
    However, fearing a serious blow, the Chiang Kai-shek plane did not dare to engage and fled in a panic.
    Our warplanes returned victoriously. The pilots and ground crews entered a tense state of preparedness again, ready to take off again and protect the safety of the motherland's airspace.
    On New Year's Eve, sailors of the East China Sea Fleet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy braved a Force 7 gale and patrolled the sea. When a patrol boat squadron approached an enemy-occupied island off the coast of Fujian, the enemies on the island were so frightened that they fired a burst of artillery. The sailors continued to patrol while driving the boat, and said humorously: What loud firecrackers, celebrating the Spring Festival for us!
    This is a heroic patrol boat squadron. It has achieved great victories in many past battles. In this squadron, there was also the sailor hero Wu Cailiang, who single-handedly jumped onto an enemy ship and captured a Chiang Kai-shek officer, and then gloriously sacrificed in a victorious air defense battle. Before the Spring Festival,艇长 Xu Rui and Zhang Shuiquan wrote a New Year's greeting letter to the mother of martyr Wu Cailiang, saying in the letter: "Dear mother, on behalf of all the comrades in the squadron, we extend New Year's greetings to you—the mother of the hero sailor. We wish you a happy Spring Festival. On the front line, on the motherland's sea, your sons are protecting you, protecting the people of the whole country!"

    为了人民欢度春节
        新华社记者集体采写
    新春佳节，全民欢乐。当人们在除夕和亲人幸福地团聚，在鞭炮声中畅饮“守岁酒”的时候，中国人民解放军的战士，他们，披风冒寒，乘风破浪，甚至在战斗的炮火中，守卫着伟大祖国的边防、海防、内防，巡逻在天空海洋。他们以自己的辛勤保卫着全国人民的幸福和欢乐。
        首都的保卫者
    除夕之夜，首都人民通宵欢乐。保卫首都的战士们，冒着寒风留在各自的岗位上。
    深夜里，巡逻放哨的公安战士们踏着轻轻的脚步，走过每一条大街小巷。他们身上洒满银色的霜花，一直踯躅到金色的曙光抹在天安门上。这些战士们把首都人民的欢乐当作自己的欢乐，把保卫首都和首都人民当作自己最大的光荣。守卫在天安门前的一个入伍才一年多的青年战士汤开政，在日记上这样写着：“天安门呵，你是祖国的中心，毛主席的检阅台，我要贡献出自己的一切，忠诚地捍卫你！”春节前，他还特地在天安门前面照了一张像片，寄给了母亲。
    在首都近郊的某空军机场上，空地勤人员们在除夕这一天打扫干净了跑道上的积雪，作好各种起飞的准备工作。入夜，在休息室里待命的飞行员们，还是着装整齐，随时准备进入座舱。几年来他们一直这样地在机场上度过除夕。
    这一夜，还有守卫在首都附近的高射炮部队的炮手们，他们也兴高采烈地把大炮擦拭得亮光光，警惕地监视着首都的天空。
        海防哨兵
    除夕的夜晚，福建前线刮着七级大风。守卫在海防前哨阵地上的战士们有时不禁被寒风吹得打颤，尘土和沙石扑面而来。一个守卫在这里度过了四个春节夜的哨兵刘群义向记者说：“这时候，全国人民该多么欢乐呀！每逢节日，我们在这里，别看生活有点苦，可是一想到人民的幸福和快乐，心眼里就只剩下高兴了！”
    深夜，在一个炮兵观察所里，二十四岁的青年观察员王春明两眼紧贴在了望镜上，全神贯注地搜索着海上和金门岛上敌人的活动。这是一个值得人民骄傲的战士。几天前，王春明才收到母亲和未婚妻的来信，叫他请假回家过春节和结婚。王春明三番五次地看着这封信，对母亲的思念和对分别了六年的未婚妻的深厚爱情，一齐涌上心头，他多么希望能在春节请假回家一趟啊！但是，他却最后决定不请假了，他在给母亲和未婚妻的信上写道：“我回家过节、结婚，当然是咱们全家的幸福和快乐，可我是祖国人民的战士，为了保卫全国人民过好春节，我怎能这时候回家去呢！”
      保卫鞍钢的战士
    鞍钢的除夕之夜，钢水和铁水照常奔流。工人们在节日里继续为祖国生产。战士们警惕地站在自己岗位上。他们有的伫立在鞍钢周围白雪皑皑的山头上，有的站在工厂的油库、主电室里，或巡逻在高炉、平炉旁。守卫在一座炼铁炉前的战士宋贵双爽快地对记者说：“七年前，当我第一次执行保卫炼铁厂任务的时候，这里遍地是荒草，只有一个炼铁炉能生产生铁；可是现在，这里却已经建设起一排排的高炉群，它一天能为祖国创造多少财富啊！我们热爱鞍钢，我们要时时刻刻地保卫它安全生产。”
    这一夜，战士们在烟尘和寒风中，通宵不眠地给鞍钢站岗。战士辛德盛刚巡逻回来，刘士有就抢先接班巡逻去了。这两个入伍刚满两年的青年战士，不久前都被评选为值勤能手。刘士有是贵州人，他在入伍以前就热爱这座祖国的钢铁基地，希望自己能成为鞍钢的建设者或保卫者。因此，当他入伍后果然成为一名保卫鞍钢的战士的时候，是多么兴奋和忠于职守啊！两年来，他出色地完成了警卫任务。战士辛德盛对自己守卫的机器的每一个声音和运转情况都熟悉了。他在近半年来，先后帮助工人给机器排除了三十次可能发生的事故，保证了安全生产。
      巡逻在天空海洋
    春节前夕，海防前线某机场上一片紧张的备战气氛。地勤人员们忙碌地擦拭着战鹰和加油充氧，飞行员们急切地等待着起飞的命令。
    “进入一等准备！”指挥部下达了命令。
    这时候，指挥员赵连城马上看见从雷达的莹光板上反映出一架从台湾起飞的蒋军飞机，朝大陆方向窜来。领航员江涛便迅速地测量出敌机的速度。我们的战鹰起飞了。
    战鹰飞上高空，钻入云层，前去迎击敌机。
    但是惧怕遭到严重打击的蒋军飞机，不敢迎战便狼狈地逃跑了。
    我们的战鹰胜利地归来。飞行员和地勤人员们又进入紧张的备战工作，以备再次起飞，保卫祖国领空的安全。
    除夕之夜，中国人民解放军海军东海舰队的水兵们冒着七级大风，巡逻在海洋上。当一支巡逻艇队驶近福建前线某敌占岛屿的时候，吓得岛上的敌人乱放了一阵炮火。水兵们一面驾艇继续巡逻，一面诙谐地说：好响的鞭炮，给我们庆祝春节啦！
    这是一支英雄的巡逻艇队。它在过去的多次战斗中取得很大胜利。在这支艇队里，也曾出现过独身跃上敌船捉一名蒋军军官、而后在一次胜利的对空作战中光荣牺牲的水兵英雄吴才良。春节前夕，艇长徐锐和张水泉给吴才良烈士的母亲写了一封拜年信，信上说：“亲爱的妈妈，我们代表全艇队的同志向您——英雄水兵的母亲拜年。祝您春节快乐。在前线，在祖国的海洋上，有您的儿子们在保卫着您，保卫着全国人民！”
