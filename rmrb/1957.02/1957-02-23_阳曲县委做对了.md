Yangqu County Party Committee Did the Right Thing
By Our Correspondent Shang Kai

Last year, when the county merged districts and townships and expanded county-level institutions, it also paid attention to strengthening leadership at the grassroots level, drawing a large number of cadres to work at the grassroots. As a result, the county-level institutions did not become excessively large, and the grassroots leadership was not weakened, ensuring the healthy development of the cooperative movement and large-scale production.

Just as various localities were transferring large numbers of cadres to the countryside, I arrived at the Yangqu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province, wanting to understand the county's situation in transferring cadres to strengthen the lower levels. When I explained my intention to Comrade Cao Xiaoyu, the county party secretary, he said, "We don't have that problem in our county now."

"What do you mean, you don't have that problem?" I was taken aback.

"Yes, since we merged districts and townships last year, we haven't actually drawn the district cadres up here. They have been staying in the townships to lead the cooperatives. Now we just tell them not to come back."

It turned out that this was the case.

When Yangqu County merged districts and townships last spring, it was also the time when various departments of the county-level organs were adding personnel and expanding their institutions. At that time, if the personnel establishment tables issued by the higher authorities were followed, it would not have been enough to transfer all the district cadres to the county. For example, the county people's committee originally had only one agriculture and forestry section, with one chief and one deputy chief. Later, it was transformed into four sections: agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation. The number of chiefs and deputy chiefs alone needed to be increased by six. Where could so many cadres be transferred from? Furthermore, last year was the first year of advanced cooperativization, and there were many new problems. Some township and cooperative cadres still lacked experience in running advanced cooperatives. At this time, if all the district cadres were drawn up, it would inevitably weaken the leadership of cooperative large-scale production. The establishment tables issued by the higher authorities now seemed impractical and would only cause a top-heavy phenomenon. However, at that time, the county party committee was still acting according to this establishment. Those who should be appointed as section chiefs were still appointed as section chiefs, and those who should be appointed as managers were still appointed as managers, but in reality, they were still placed at the grassroots level to do their original work. In this way, the strength of the grassroots cadres was not weakened.

To do this, it was necessary to get the cadres of the various departments on board ideologically. The county party committee told the cadres of the various departments: Our work is mainly in the countryside. As long as the work below is done well, everything will be easy to handle; if the work below is done poorly, then even if we sit on our benches in the office until they collapse, the work will not be done well. The responsible comrades of the county oil and fat company and the food company once raised an objection to the county party committee, saying, "We have managers in name, but we haven't even seen their shadows. What do we do if we can't complete our tasks?" The responsible comrades of the county party committee said to them, "Whether you can complete your tasks does not depend on the office, but on the countryside. If everyone sits in the office and the rural work is not done well, and the peasants do not grow oil crops or raise pigs, think about what you will purchase?" Only then did they get their ideas straight.

At the same time, the various departments of the county party committee took the lead in setting an example and vigorously streamlining cadres. The organization department of the county party committee, including the chief and deputy chiefs, had a total of eleven people. After careful calculation, it was found that only three people were needed to undertake all the work of the organization department, and eight cadres could be drawn out to go to the grassroots level. The same was true of the propaganda department. According to the establishment, there were six cadres. According to the business situation, it was calculated that only two staff members should be left in the office, and the rest could be drawn to the grassroots level. Then, the county party committee helped the various sections and offices of the county people's committee and the economic and enterprise departments to calculate the workload and the number of cadres in detail. The calculation results proved that some people could be drawn out. For example, the finance section had three chiefs and deputy chiefs. In fact, some of the specific work of the finance section, such as accounting and cashiering, were done by several staff members, and major issues such as financial expenditures had to be approved by the county head. The chief's work was not very much. Therefore, the county party committee obtained the consent of the county people's committee and drew out two of the three section chiefs to go to the grassroots level. The situation of other sections and offices and economic and enterprise departments was roughly the same. If there were three section chiefs, two were drawn out; if there were two managers, one was drawn out, and this did not affect the daily work.

A year of practice has proved that the Yangqu County Party Committee did the right thing. By doing so, the business of the various departments and systems was not delayed, and the leadership of the grassroots organizations was not weakened because of the merger of districts and townships, thus ensuring the healthy development of the cooperative movement. After the transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, many major issues such as the formulation of plans within the cooperative, the clearing of finances, and the planning of labor were handled in a timely manner. At the beginning of the transition to advanced cooperatives, there was a tendency to undervalue the pricing of the means of production entering the cooperative, which hurt the unity of the middle peasants. Because a large number of cadres lived at the grassroots level, it was discovered and resolved in a timely manner, ensuring the rapid consolidation of the cooperative and the smooth development of production.

"Of course, this does not mean that our grassroots work does not need to be strengthened." The deputy secretary of the county party committee finally said, "After studying the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, we plan to reorganize the grassroots work cadres before the spring plowing, and transfer another group of cadres with rural work experience and certain leadership capabilities from the county-level leading organs to work in the grassroots work groups to strengthen the leadership of the grassroots work."

The county party committee is now working on doing this.

### 阳曲县委做对了

    阳曲县委做对了
    本报记者　商恺
    这个县在去年撤区并乡扩大县级机构的时候，同时注意加强基层的领导，抽出大批干部到基层工作，这样县级机构没有因此变得过分庞大，基层领导也没有因此被削弱，保证了合作化和大生产运动的健康发展。
    正当各地抽调大批干部下乡的时候，我到了中共山西阳曲县委会，想了解这个县调动干部充实下层的情况。当我向县委书记曹效禹同志说明我的来意后，他说：“我们县里现在不存在这个问题。”
    “怎么，不存在这个问题？”我愕然了。
    “是的，我们县里自从撤区并乡以后，实际上没有把区干部抽上来，他们一直住在乡里领导合作社。现在我们只是告诉他们一声，让他们不要回来就是了。”
    事情原来是这样的。
    阳曲县在去年春天撤区并乡的时候，也正是县级机关各部门增添人员扩大机构的时候。当时如果按照上面发下来的各部门的人员编制表进行配备，那么把所有的区干部都调到县上来也是不够的。比如县人民委员会原来只有一个农林科，有正副科长各一人，后来一变而为农业、林牧、水利和水土保持等四个科，仅正副科长就需要增加六人，从那里调配这么多的干部呢？再说，去年是高级合作化的第一年，新问题很多，一些乡社干部还缺乏办高级社的经验。这时候，如果把所有的区干部都抽上来，那么必定会削弱对合作化大生产的领导。上级机关发给他们的编制表现在看来是不合实际的，只会造成头重脚轻的现象。但当时，县委还是按这个编制办事的。各部门应该配备科长的还是配备科长，应该配备经理的还是配备经理，但实际上仍将他们放在基层干原来的工作。这样，基层干部的力量并没有削弱。
    这样做，就得打通各部门干部的思想。县委对各部门的干部这样讲：我们的工作主要在农村，只要下边的工作搞得好，那么一切工作都好办；如果下边工作搞得糟，那么我们在机关里把凳子坐塌了，工作也是作不好的。县油脂公司和食品公司负责同志对县委曾提出意见说：“名义上给我们配备了经理，实际上连影儿也没见，完不成任务怎么办？”县委负责同志就对他们说：“你们的任务能不能完成，不决定于办公室，而决定于农村。如果大家都坐在办公室里，农村工作搞不好，农民不种油料不养猪，想想看，你们收购什么？”这下子才把他们的思想打通了。
    同时县委各部门首先作出榜样来，大力精简干部。县委组织部连同正副部长在内，共有十一人，经过仔细计算，只要有三个人就可以担负起组织部的全部工作，可以抽出八个干部到基层去。宣传部也是这样，按编制是六个干部，根据业务情况来计算，只留两个干事在机关，也就绰绰有余了，其余的都可以抽到基层去。接着，县委又帮助县人民委员会的各科、室及经济企业部门，详细计算了工作量和干部人数，计算结果证明都可抽出一些人来。比如，财政科有正副科长三名，实际上财政科的一些具体工作如会计、出纳等都是由几个科员去做，有关财政开支等重大的问题，又须经县长批准，科长工作并不很多。于是，县委取得县人民委员会的同意，从三个科长中抽出两个放到基层去。其他各科室及经济企业部门的情况大体也是如此，有三个科长的抽两个；有两个经理的抽一个，这样并不影响日常工作。
    一年的实践证明，阳曲县委是作对了。这样做，各部门各系统的业务并没有耽误，而基层组织的领导也没有因为撤区并乡而削弱，因而保证了合作化运动的健康发展。初级社转高级社以后，社内计划的制定、财务的清理、劳动的规划等等，许多重大问题都及时地处理了。转高级社开始时，曾发生过生产资料入社作价过低，伤害了和中农的团结的偏向，由于大批干部住在基层，也就及时发现、及时解决了，保证了合作社的迅速巩固和生产的顺利发展。
    “当然，这并不是说我们的基层工作不需要再加强了。”县委副书记最后说：“在学习了二中全会决议以后，我们计划在春耕前，把基层工作干部进行一次整编，从县级领导机关中再抽调一批有农村工作经验，有一定领导能力的干部到基层工作组去工作，以加强对基层工作的领导。”
    现在县委已在着手这样做了。
