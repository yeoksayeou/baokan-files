Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 17th. How to do everything possible to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year was an important topic at the meeting of Party Committee Secretaries of Regions, Cities, and Counties convened by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party from February 7th to 15th.

　　The meeting studied the agricultural production plan targets for Hebei Province this year and unanimously agreed that the Provincial Party Committee’s proposal to appropriately reduce the planting area of cash crops and expand the planting area of grain crops was an important strategy among all possible strategies. The targets for this year are: to increase the sown area of grain crops by 4.75 million mu compared to 1956, with a planned yield of 157.33 jin per mu, an increase of 8.05% compared to 1955; and a total output increase of 14.67% compared to 1955 (because last year's production was reduced due to disasters, the comparison is made with 1955, the same below). The planned cotton sown area will be reduced by 3.18 million mu compared to 1956, with a planned yield of 41.63 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 4.3% compared to 1955; and a total output equivalent to 91.62% of 1955. The sown areas of peanuts and soybeans will also be reduced by more than one million mu compared to 1956, and the yield per mu will be increased accordingly, with the total output being approximately 87% and 88% of 1955, respectively. In addition, the province's annual pig raising should increase by 1.28 million head compared to last year; large livestock (mules, horses, cattle, donkeys) should increase by 60,000 head compared to last year; and the output value of sideline production should reach more than 20% of the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations, an increase of 6.98% compared to last year. The meeting believed that this target is in line with the current actual situation in Hebei Province. The most serious problem in current agricultural production in Hebei Province is grain production. The proportion of the sown area of grain crops in the province was 76.4% in 1949, which decreased to 73.9% in 1956, while the cotton planting area increased by nearly doubled, and peanuts increased by nearly one-third. This change not only affects grain production but also affects livestock feed. Appropriately changing this year does not mean neglecting the increase in cash crop production. The cotton fields are mainly compressed in areas that are too concentrated and unsuitable for planting (such as those prone to abandonment due to disasters, etc.). Peanuts and soybeans are also mainly compressed in areas unsuitable for planting. The meeting proposed that all regions should strive to increase the yield per unit area of cotton to support national economic construction and appropriately meet the requirements of farmers who want to plant cotton to increase production and income. For grain crops, under the premise of striving to increase total output, each county and cooperative can plant according to local conditions, without being restricted by variety. However, leadership must be strengthened, and it cannot be left to its own devices.

　　Another important strategy proposed by the meeting is, according to the situation in Hebei Province where flooding is easy in summer, to "grab a handful first" before the big water comes, and strive to increase production and ensure harvest for more than 50 million mu (about half of the province's cultivated area) of wheat and early-maturing, flood-resistant crops. The meeting pointed out that this is very important for relieving the current difficulties in Hebei Province and achieving a bumper harvest this year. Therefore, each county must especially strengthen the management of wheat, quickly solve the problem of seeds for early-maturing and flood-resistant crops in the easy-to-flood areas, and ensure timely planting.

　　The meeting proposed that, under the current specific conditions in Hebei Province, the main aspect of striving for a bumper harvest should be to concentrate efforts to think of all possible ways to promote various effective production-increasing measures and strive to increase the yield per unit area. In promoting production-increasing measures, the following should be noted: successful measures promoted last year must be adhered to and actively promoted in areas with the same conditions; the reasons for failures must be clarified, lessons learned, and not repeated; those whose success or failure has not yet been determined should continue to be tested in small areas; and new measures should be taken in two or three steps, and gradually promoted. It is necessary to oppose the two deviations of blindly rushing forward, promoting rigidly regardless of conditions, and being negatively conservative and not daring to boldly promote. The meeting also required all regions to specifically analyze the local conditions, grasp a few key fundamental measures, concentrate efforts, and promote them. When promoting various production-increasing measures, they should be arranged uniformly with the labor planning and financial planning of the agricultural cooperatives; vigorously summarize and promote the advanced experiences of the farmers, and combine them with science and technology.

　　In order to achieve a bumper agricultural harvest, the meeting believed that it is necessary to do a good job in rectifying the cooperatives and ideological education, and on this basis, to launch a competition movement to strive for a bumper harvest. At present, special attention should be paid to doing a good job in preparing for spring plowing.

### 河北省地、市、县委书记会议集体定计  争取以粮食为主的全面大丰收  要趁雨季前先抓小麦和早熟作物增产

    河北省地、市、县委书记会议集体定计
    争取以粮食为主的全面大丰收
    要趁雨季前先抓小麦和早熟作物增产
    新华社保定17日电　如何千方百计争取今年农业大丰收，是中共河北省委员会在2月7日到15日召开的地、市、县委书记会议上的重要议题。
    会议研究了今年河北省农业生产计划指标，一致同意省委提出的适当减少经济作物种植面积扩大粮食作物种植面积作为千方百计中的重要一计。今年的指标是：粮食作物播种面积比1956年增加四百七十五万亩，亩产量预定为一百五十七点三三斤，比1955年提高8.05％；总产量要比1955年增加14.67％（因去年受灾减产，故与1955年相比，下同）。棉花播种面积计划要比1956年减少三百一十八万亩，预定亩产皮棉四十一点六三斤，比1955年提高4.3％；总产量相当于1955年的91.62％。花生、大豆播种面积也都比1956年减少一百万亩多些，亩产量也相应提高，总产量分别约为1955年的87％和88％。此外，全省全年养猪要比去年增加一百二十八万口；大牲畜（骡、马、牛、驴）比去年增加六万头；副业生产产值要达到相当于农副业总产值的20％以上，比去年提高6.98％。会议认为，这个指标是切合河北省当前实际情况的。河北省当前农业生产上最严重的是粮食生产问题。全省粮食作物播种面积的比重，1949年是76.4％，到1956年下降为73.9％，棉花种植面积则增加了将近一倍，花生增加了将近三分之一。这种变化不仅影响到粮食生产，而且影响到牲畜饲草。今年适当改变，这并不意味着忽视经济作物的增产。棉田主要是压缩过于集中和不宜种植（如易因灾废弃等）的部分。花生、大豆主要也是压缩不宜种植的部分。会议提出，各地要力争提高棉花单位面积产量，来支援国家经济建设和适当满足农民群众想要植棉增产增加收入的要求。对于粮食作物，要在力求提高总产量的前提下，各县、社可因地种植，不受品种限制。但必须加强领导，不能放任自流。
    会议提出的千方百计中的另一重要之计，是根据河北省夏季易涝的情况，在大水未来之前“先抓一把”，争取五千万亩以上（占全省耕地面积一半左右）的小麦和早熟、抗涝作物增产保收。会议指出，这对解除河北省当前困难和取得今年丰收十分重要，因此，各县要特别加强小麦管理，迅速解决易涝区早熟、抗涝作物的种子，保证及时下种。
    会议提出，在河北省目前的具体条件下，争取丰收的主要方面，应是集中力量想尽一切办法，推行各项有效增产措施，努力提高单位面积产量。各地在推行增产措施中应该注意的是：对去年推行的各项措施，成功的必须坚持并在条件相同地区积极推广；失败的必须弄清原因，吸取教训，不再重复；尚未肯定成败的要继续在小范围内试验；新的措施要采取两步、三步走的办法，逐步推广。要反对盲目冒进，不顾条件硬推广和消极保守不敢大胆推广的两种偏向。会议还要求各地区要对当地的各项条件加以具体分析，抓住带有关键性的几项根本措施，集中力量，加以推行。在推行各项增产措施时，要与农业社的劳力规划、财务规划统一安排；要大力总结推广农民群众中的先进经验，并与科学技术结合起来。
    为了取得农业大丰收，会议认为必须做好整社和思想教育工作，在这个基础上要开展起一个争取大丰收的竞赛运动。当前，要特别注意做好备耕工作。
