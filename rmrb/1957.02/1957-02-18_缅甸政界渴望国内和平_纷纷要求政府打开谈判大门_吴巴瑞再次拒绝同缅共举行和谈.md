Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 15th: Since the Burmese Communist Party, the Burmese Red Flag Communist Party, and the People's Volunteer Organization submitted peace proposals to the Burmese government, various organizations and political parties in Burma have recently put forward various suggestions on achieving domestic peace.

The Burmese Domestic Peace Organization, led by the veteran of the Burmese political and literary circles, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, believes that domestic peace can only be achieved if the warring parties can come together for negotiations. This organization suggests that this issue should be resolved using the principle of fairness, which neither benefits nor disadvantages either side. This principle is supported by the Burmese National United Front and the Burmese Youth Front.

The People's Unity Party, led by U Tin Pe Myint, one of the leaders of the opposition party in the Burmese Parliament, welcomes the attitude expressed by the Burmese Communist Party in a recent letter to the Burmese Socialist Party. The People's Unity Party requests that government forces and underground forces consider the issue of domestic peace based on this letter.

The right-wing Burmese Nationalist Group, in a statement, called on government forces and underground forces to cease fire immediately and asked them not to consider the ideological leanings of their parties, but to consider themselves as citizens of Burma. The Burmese Nationalist Group suggested that negotiations on "terms of surrender and terms of amnesty" be held on the basis of these two conditions.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon: Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe once again stated on the 12th that he refused to hold negotiations with the Burmese Communist Party to achieve domestic peace.

He said that the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League government will continue to fight the "saboteurs" and will never give up until the "saboteurs" are completely eliminated.

According to him, the "underground rebels" are taking the path of fascism. If the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League government negotiates with the "rebels," it will be "betraying" the people.

    缅甸政界渴望国内和平
    纷纷要求政府打开谈判大门
    吴巴瑞再次拒绝同缅共举行和谈
    据新华社仰光15日电　自从缅甸共产党、缅甸红旗共产党和人民志愿军向缅甸政府提出和平建议以来，缅甸的各组织和政党最近提出了关于实现国内和平的各种建议。
    由缅甸政治界和文艺界元老德钦哥都迈领导的缅甸国内和平组织认为，只有交战双方能够到一起来谈判，才能实现国内和平。这个组织建议，应该用使双方都不吃亏也都不占便宜的公平原则来解决这个问题。这样的原则得到缅甸民族团结阵线、缅甸青年阵线的支持。
    由缅甸议会的反对党领袖之一吴登佩密领导的人民团结党，欢迎缅甸共产党在最近送交缅甸社会党的一封信中所表示的态度。人民团结党要求政府部队和地下部队在这封信的基础上考虑国内和平问题。
    右翼的缅甸民族主义者集团在一项声明中要求政府部队和地下部队立即停火，并且要求他们不要去考虑他们的党的思想意识，而去考虑他们自己是缅甸的国民。缅甸民族主义者集团建议，在这两个条件的基础上举行“关于投降条件和赦免条件的谈判”。
    据新华社仰光电　缅甸总理吴巴瑞12日再一次表示拒绝同缅甸共产党举行谈判以实现国内和平。
    他说，反法西斯人民自由同盟的政府将继续同“破坏分子”作战，不把“破坏分子”完全消灭决不罢休。
    据他说，“地下叛乱分子”所采取的是法西斯的道路。如果反法西斯人民自由同盟的政府同“叛乱分子”谈判，那它就是对人民“背信”。
