    To Solve the Livelihood Problems of Disaster-stricken Farmers This Spring
    Ren County Starts Sowing Early-maturing Crops
    (Our Newspaper News) Ren County, Hebei Province, suffered severe disasters last year. More than 60 out of the 79 agricultural cooperatives in the county saw little harvest in the autumn. In order to solve the livelihood problems of disaster-stricken farmers this spring and increase the income of cooperative members, the county party committee mobilized each cooperative to plant more early-maturing crops appropriately. Currently, each cooperative has prepared for sowing hyacinth beans and peas. Some cooperatives have already started sowing. The county plans to plant 27,159 mu of hyacinth beans and 8,490 mu of peas.
