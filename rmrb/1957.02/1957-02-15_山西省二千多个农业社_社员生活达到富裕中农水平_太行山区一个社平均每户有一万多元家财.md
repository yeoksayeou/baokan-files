According to the Shanxi Daily: In the first year of advanced agricultural collectivization in Shanxi Province, the living standards of 2,770 agricultural production cooperative members reached the level of prosperous middle peasants; these cooperatives accounted for 13.69% of the total number of cooperatives in the province.

According to surveys conducted in 1955 by various special districts, the average income per person for prosperous middle peasants was 70 yuan in Changzhi District, 120 yuan in Jinan District, 80 yuan in Yuci District, 60 yuan in Xinzhou District, and 50 yuan in Yanbei District. Last year, under the correct leadership of the Party and with strong financial and technical assistance from the state, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province fully utilized the superior conditions of collectivization and achieved a bumper harvest despite continuous natural disasters such as floods, waterlogging, insects, hail, and frost. According to statistics from 2,233 agricultural cooperatives across the province, the average income per person was 54.4 yuan, an increase of 14% compared to 1955. Adding in the income from household sideline occupations, the average income per person reached 64 yuan.

The facts of the past year have proven that as long as the production level of cooperatives catches up with that of prosperous middle peasants, the income of prosperous middle peasants after joining the cooperative will also increase. Last year, the number of cooperatives in Changzhi District whose production level and members' living standards caught up with or even exceeded those of prosperous middle peasants reached 700, accounting for 16.4% of the total number of cooperatives in the district; Jinan District had 208 cooperatives, accounting for 6.14% of the total number of cooperatives in the district; Yuci District had 637 cooperatives, accounting for 15% of the total number of cooperatives in the district; Xinzhou District had 620 cooperatives, accounting for 13% of the total number of cooperatives in the district; Yanbei District had 517 cooperatives, accounting for 17% of the total number of cooperatives in the district; and various cities had 88 cooperatives, accounting for 12.17% of the total number of cooperatives in the cities.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 14th: In the northern part of the most impoverished Taihang Mountain area of Shanxi Province, a wealthy agricultural production cooperative has emerged for the first time where each member household has an average of "tens of thousands of strings of cash." This cooperative is the Jian Shan Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Daobakou, Xiyang County. Zhang Meini, the deputy director of this cooperative, recently reported on the process of how the farmers organized themselves and transformed from poverty to prosperity at the first representative conference of agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province.

Thirteen years ago, the area surrounding Daobakou Village in Xiyang County was still a landscape of rocky mountains, with barren grass covering the slopes and scattered plots of land. Drought, floods, wind, and hail occurred year after year, and the farmers living here endured a life of scarcity for generations. However, since organizing in 1944, through the collective production of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production have achieved comprehensive development, and the wealth of the entire cooperative has rapidly increased. Now, in addition to more than 260 mu of good terraced fields, the cooperative also has more than 17,500 mu of trees, 74 head of livestock, 620 sheep, as well as many pigs, chickens, silkworms, bees, and fruit trees. The trees alone are worth more than 340,000 yuan (trees that can be used as rafters are calculated at 0.6 yuan per tree; trees that are bowl-thick and thicker are calculated at 1 yuan or more). If all of this wealth is converted into cash, the 35 member households in the cooperative would have an average of more than 10,000 yuan each.

Due to the cooperative's comprehensive development of production, after being converted into an advanced cooperative last year, despite agricultural disasters and reduced production, the total income still increased by 44% compared to 1955, and more than tripled compared to before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Apart from two "five guarantees" households, all other members of the cooperative have increased their income. All members of the cooperative eat their fill and wear warm clothes, and every family has added new felt and new quilts. During the Spring Festival, they also slaughtered pigs and sheep.

    山西省二千多个农业社
    社员生活达到富裕中农水平
    太行山区一个社平均每户有一万多元家财
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：山西在高级农业合作化第一年，全省就有二千七百七十个农业生产合作社社员的生活水平，达到了富裕中农的生活水平；这些社占全省总社数的13.69％。
    据1955年各个专区的调查，长治区富裕中农每人平均收入为七十元，晋南区每人为一百二十元，榆次区每人为八十元，忻县区每人为六十元，雁北区每人平均为五十元。去年，全省农业社在党的正确领导下，在国家的财政和技术大力援助下，充分发挥了合作化的优越条件，在涝、水、虫、雹、霜冻等自然灾害连续侵袭下，仍然取得了丰收。据全省二千零二百三十三个农业社的统计，每人平均收入为五十四点四元，比1955年增加了14％，加上社员的家庭副业等收入，每人平均收入达六十四元。
    一年来的事实证明：只要合作社的生产水平赶上富裕中农的生产水平，富裕中农入社后的收入也是会增加的。去年，生产水平和社员生活水平赶上以至超过富裕中农的合作社，长治区已有七百个社，占全区总社数16.4％；晋南区有二百零八个社，占全区总社数6.14％；榆次区有六百三十七个社，占全区总社数15％；忻县区有六百二十个社，占全区总社数13％；雁北区有五百一十七个社，占全区总社数17％；各市有八十八个社，占各市总社数12.17％。
    新华社太原14日电　在山西省最贫困的太行山区北部，首次出现一个每户社员平均有“万贯家财”的富裕农业生产合作社。这个社是昔阳县刀把口建山高级农业社。这个社的副主任张美妮，最近在山西省农业社第一次代表会议上，报告了农民们组织起来由穷变富的经过。
    十三年前，昔阳县刀把口村四周还是一片石山，荒草遍坡，土地零散，旱、涝、风、雹连年不断，住在这里的农民世世代代过着少吃没穿的苦日子。但从1944年开始组织起来以后，经过互助组和农业生产合作社的集体生产，农林牧业和副业生产获得了全面的发展，全社的财富迅速增加。现在，这个社除有二百六十多亩好梯田外，还有一万七千五百多亩树木，七十四头牲畜，六百二十只羊，以及很多猪、鸡、蚕、蜜蜂和果树。其中仅树木一项即价值三十四万多元（能作椽子的树每棵按六角钱计算；碗口粗和更粗的树按一元以上计算）如把这些财富全部折款，全社三十五户社员平均每户有一万多元。
    由于这个社全面的发展生产，在去年转为高级社后，尽管农业遭灾减产，但总收入还比1955年增加44％，比抗日战争以前增加三倍多，全社除两户“五保”户外，其余社员都增加了收入。全社社员吃的饱穿的暖，家家添置新毡新被，春节期间还宰猪杀羊。
