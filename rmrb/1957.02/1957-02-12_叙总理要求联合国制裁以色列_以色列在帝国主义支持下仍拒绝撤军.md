Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, Damascus dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali on the 10th demanded that the United Nations impose the most severe sanctions on Israel for its refusal to withdraw from the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip.

He said that an appropriate sanction would be to expel Israel from the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, Tel Aviv dispatch: Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion met with the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Lawson, on the evening of the 10th and gave Lawson the original draft of his recent reply telegram to President Eisenhower.

The contents of Eisenhower's telegram to Ben-Gurion and Ben-Gurion's reply telegram have not been released.

According to the Associated Press on the 10th, citing "a well-informed source" in Tel Aviv, Ben-Gurion told Eisenhower in his reply telegram that Israel must obtain the guarantees it requires, including that the Gaza Strip not be restored to its original state, before it withdraws its troops from the Gulf of Aqaba region and the Gaza Strip.

Shimon Peres, Director-General of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, said on the 8th upon his return to Tel Aviv from Paris that France would aid Israel if economic sanctions were imposed on it. Peres told reporters at the airport that "France will be able to support and assist Israel in any situation that Israel may find itself in in the near future."

    叙总理要求联合国制裁以色列
    以色列在帝国主义支持下仍拒绝撤军
    新华社11日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利10日要求联合国对以色列拒绝撤出亚喀巴湾和加沙地带的行为给以最严厉的制裁。
    他说，适当的制裁是把以色列逐出联合国。
    据新华社11日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列总理本—古里安在10日晚上接见美国驻以色列大使劳逊，并且把他最近给艾森豪威尔总统的复电的原稿交给劳逊。
    艾森豪威尔给本—古里安的电报以及本—古里安的复电的内容都没有公布。
    据美联社10日援引特拉维夫“一个消息灵通人士”的话说，本—古里安在复电中告诉艾森豪威尔，以色列必须取得它所要求的保证，其中包括加沙地区不得恢复到原来的状态，然后它才从亚喀巴湾地区和加沙地区撤军。
    以色列国防部办公厅主任希蒙·佩雷斯8日在从巴黎回到特拉维夫的时候曾经说，如果对以色列实行经济制裁，法国就会援助以色列。佩雷斯在机场向记者说，“预料在以色列在最近的将来可能处的任何情况下，法国都能够支持和援助它。”
