Xinhua News Agency, February 18th, TASS, Bonn, February 17th: Some representatives of the German Social Democratic Party are demanding improvement in relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union.

    West German Federal Parliament member Viener of the German Social Democratic Party said that it is necessary to "gradually, under possible conditions, concretely and vigorously improve German-Soviet relations."

    Viener said that it is very necessary "to take a series of possible steps" to normalize relations between Bonn and Moscow. Therefore, Bulganin's letter to Adenauer should not be viewed negatively and simply rejected, but "all of Bulganin's suggestions should be studied. This will not cause us any loss."

    Karl Schmid, a Social Democrat and Vice President of the Federal Parliament, also said in a radio speech that Bulganin's letter provided a good opportunity for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union on the basis of mutual dialogue between the two countries. Schmid is in favor of serious negotiations with the Soviet Union on trade agreements.

    Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch: Erich Ollenhauer, chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, delivered a speech at a luncheon hosted by the American Foreign Policy Association on the 13th, advocating that the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France "reach an agreement on the international military status of a unified Germany as a preparatory step to achieving further agreements." He said that such an agreement must prevent an all-German government from joining either of the existing military camps.

    Ollenhauer once again talked about his party's proposal to establish a new collective security system in Europe to replace the current military alliances in Western and Eastern Europe, a system that includes a reunified Germany and Germany's eastern and western neighbors. He said that such a European security system should stipulate "guarantees made by the Soviet Union and the United States."

    要求改善西德同苏联的关系
    奥伦豪尔主张由美苏英法就德国问题取得协议
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社波恩17日讯：德国社会民主党的一些代表人物要求改善德意志联邦共和国同苏联的关系。
    西德联邦议院德国社会民主党议员维涅尔说，必须“逐步地在可能的条件下，具体而大力地改善德苏关系”。
    维涅尔说，非常有必要“采取一系列可能的步骤”，使波恩和莫斯科之间的关系正常化。因此，不应当把布尔加宁给阿登纳的信看作是消极的而简单地加以拒绝，却“应当研究布尔加宁的全部建议。这对我们不会有任何损失。”
    社会民主党员、联邦议院副主席卡·施密德也在广播演说里说，布尔加宁的信为德意志联邦共和国和苏联之间的外交关系建立在两国互相交谈的基础上提供了良好的机会。施密德赞成认真地同苏联进行贸易协定的谈判。
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔13日在美国外交政策协会举办的午餐会上发表演说，主张由美国、苏联、英国和法国“就统一的德国的国际军事地位取得协议，以此作为取得进一步协议的预备步骤”。他说，这样的一项协议必须防止全德政府参加现存的两个军事阵营中的任何一个阵营。
    奥伦豪尔又一次谈到他的党关于在欧洲建立一个新的集体安全体系的主张，这样一个体系用来代替目前西欧和东欧的军事联盟，这个体系中包括重新统一的德国以及德国的东西邻国。他说，这样的一个欧洲安全体系应该规定“由苏联和美国作出保证”。
