Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd -- "As long as we actively find solutions, the potential for increasing production and practicing economy is great." This is the conclusion reached by Shandong provincial organs through the formulation of plans for increasing production and practicing economy in 1957.

Before formulating plans for increasing production and practicing economy, many units of Shandong provincial organs felt that this year's budget was tight, and it would be difficult to complete various plans. For example, the basic construction investment of the Provincial Department of Agriculture was reduced by more than half compared with last year. At first, this department felt very embarrassed. However, after careful calculation, it was found that not only could this year's basic construction plan be completed, but also one million yuan could be used to start new undertakings. In the water conservancy sector, for the wheat harvesting construction alone, after careful calculation, 70,000 fewer migrant workers can be mobilized from the 300,000 migrant workers, which can save about 500,000 yuan in management expenses. Departments under the Industrial Department have also come up with many ways to increase production. For example, by adjusting the specifications of seven types of cloth and saving recycled silk, 1,800+ bales of cotton yarn can be saved without affecting quality, and cloth production can be increased by more than 2.62 million meters. If peanut oil can produce half a jin more oil per hundred jin of raw materials, it can increase edible oil production by one million jin. In the province's transportation sector, if the utilization efficiency of automobile tires is increased by 18%, more than 570,000 yuan can be saved throughout the year. Five units in the financial and trade departments, using methods such as increasing the flour extraction rate of wheat, the rice extraction rate of millet, and using old bags to repack flour, can achieve a total increase in production and economy of more than 50.07 million yuan throughout the year.

The administrative expenses saved by the provincial organs are also a considerable figure. This year, the provincial directly affiliated organs and the Party and government organs at the special district and district levels can reduce expenditure by 8.87 million yuan by stopping the construction of housing, reducing meetings and official documents, and lowering the standard of office expenses.

    积极挖掘潜力　完成今年计划
    山东省级机关制定增产节约方案
    新华社济南23日电　只要积极想办法，增产节约潜力大。这是山东省级各机关通过制定1957年增产节约方案得出的结论。
    山东省级机关在制定增产节约方案前，许多单位都觉得今年预算紧缩了，各项计划很难完成。如省农业厅的基本建设投资较去年减少了一半多，这个厅开始时觉得非常为难，但经过精打细算，发现不但可以完成今年的基本建设计划，而且还可以拿出一百万元来举办新的事业。水利部门仅跨麦收施工一项，经过精打细算后在三十万民工中就可少调七万人，这样就可少支出管理费用五十万元左右。工业厅所属部门也想出了许多增产的办法。如调整七种布的规格、节约回丝等，在不影响质量的原则下，可以节省棉纱一千八百多件，能增产布二百六十二万多公尺；花生油如每百斤原料能多出油半斤，就可以增产食油一百万斤。全省交通运输部门，如把汽车轮胎使用效率提高18％，全年就可节约五十七万多元。财贸部门的五个单位用提高小麦出粉率、小米出米率、利用旧袋回装面粉等办法，全年增产节约的总指标就可以达到五千零七十多万元。
    省级各机关节省下来的行政费用，也是一笔可观的数字。仅省级直属机关和专署、区级的党、政机关今年停建住房、减少会议、公文，降低办公费标准等项就可紧缩公务费支出八百八十七万元。
