Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: To meet the needs of people utilizing old clothes and saving fabric for the country, Beijing's clothing production cooperatives are actively developing businesses in dismantling, mending, and remodeling old clothes.

Recently, many storefronts of clothing production cooperatives scattered along the streets of Beijing have successively put up signs saying "Also Engaged in Dismantling, Mending, and Remodeling of Old Clothes." In recent days, the old clothes dismantling, remodeling, and repairing work in various storefronts has been overwhelming. Some people have even brought out Qing Dynasty-era mandarin jackets from their homes to be remodeled for wearing. The city's clothing cooperatives specializing in piecemeal clothing processing plan to produce 1.7 million pieces this year. By the most conservative estimate, old clothes remodeling will account for 10% of the total business volume. Every three pieces of old clothes that have their lifespan extended are equivalent to one new piece of clothing. After the clothing cooperatives develop this business, they can save the country approximately nearly 500,000 chi of cotton cloth this year.

    北京许多服装合作社
    为居民翻修旧衣
    据新华社18日讯　为适应人们利用旧衣、为国家节省布匹的需要，北京市服装生产合作社积极开展旧衣拆补翻修业务。
    最近服装生产合作社散布在大街上的许多门市部，先后挂上了“兼营旧衣拆补翻修业务”的牌子。近日来，各门市部的旧衣拆改翻修活计应接不暇。有的人把家里清代留下来的马褂拿出来改着穿。全市专作零星服装加工的服装社，今年计划产量为一百七十万件，按最保守的估计，旧衣翻改活将占总业务量的10％，每三件旧衣寿命抵一件新衣，服装社开展这项业务后，今年大约可替国家节省近五十万尺棉布。
