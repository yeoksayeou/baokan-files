Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Currently, agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province are formulating this year's production plans and studying improvements in business management. This work is being carried out by 94% of the province's agricultural cooperatives after they completed their 1956 year-end distribution settlements before the Spring Festival. Cooperatives that started earlier have already completed the formulation of production plans and have established many systems for improving business management.

Generally, in guiding agricultural cooperatives to formulate production plans, revise labor quotas, and implement contracting work to households, all areas have more rationally arranged the relationship between the state, the agricultural cooperative, and the members, as well as the relationship between the cooperative's internal plans for increased production and income and plans for distribution, labor, and finance. They have also proposed several improvement measures. According to relevant departments, the number of agricultural cooperatives implementing contracting work to households this year has also increased compared to last year. Before the Spring Festival, 60% of the agricultural cooperatives in Huimin Prefecture had implemented the contracting work to households system. Many agricultural cooperatives in Liaocheng Prefecture have also comprehensively arranged plans for increasing production, income, production, and members' living expenses from top to bottom by formulating production plans. This ensures both the needs of the state and the needs of the members. In order to change the past phenomenon of excessive and rigid restrictions on production teams and members in all aspects, many agricultural cooperatives in this prefecture have given production teams the flexibility to revise quotas this year; they also particularly emphasized that production teams should assist member households in planning labor attendance, sideline occupations, fertilizer accumulation, and the management of private plots.

The shortage and weakness of draught animals is a fairly common phenomenon in rural Shandong. In order to reverse this situation, many agricultural cooperatives are implementing the principle of preserving the capital and value of livestock, strengthening the production teams' care and feeding of livestock, and promoting the experience of contracting work, care, and use. In order to implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, many agricultural cooperatives have also stipulated a system of planning income and expenditure quarterly and monthly, acting according to income, and acting according to capacity.

Some deviations have also occurred in the process of agricultural cooperatives formulating production plans and studying improvements in business management. For example, some cooperatives had the mentality of "rather low than high" when setting production plans; emphasizing democracy led to neglecting state plans, or emphasizing state plans led to neglecting local conditions and the needs of members. In some cooperatives, the implementation of contracting work to households failed to mobilize the masses and relaxed leadership, allowing teams to set their own production and work points, resulting in the phenomenon of suppressing output and raising work points. Party and government organizations at all levels are leading agricultural cooperatives to correct these deviations.

Agricultural cooperatives that have completed the year-end distribution settlements, production plans, and implemented contracting work to households are performing well in all aspects of production, and preparations for spring plowing have made some progress. According to incomplete statistics from mid-January, agricultural cooperatives across the province transported ice and snow to suppress wheat on more than 548,400 mu, accumulated more than 25.13 million cartloads of soil fertilizer, and accumulated 274.22 million jin of manure, dry ash, and urine fertilizer. In Laiyang Prefecture, each household generally accumulated 80 loads of fertilizer (each load weighing about 250 jin), an increase of 10 loads compared to the same period last year.

    山东各地农业生产合作社
    制订生产计划　改进经营管理
    有些社包工包产中发生的偏向已在纠正
    新华社济南10日电　目前，山东省各地农业社正在制订今年的生产计划和研究改进经营管理工作。这两项工作，是全省94％的农业社在春节前先后完成1956年的年终分配决算以后进行的，着手较早的农业社已经结束了制订生产计划的工作，并且订出许多改进经营管理的制度。
    各地在领导农业社制订生产计划、修订劳动定额、进行包工包产时，一般的都比较合理地安排了国家、农业社和社员三者之间的关系，以及合作社内部的增产增收计划和分配、劳动、财务计划之间的关系，提出了若干改进办法。据有关部门了解，今年实行包工包产的农业社也比去年增多。到春节前，惠民地区已有60％的农业社推行了包工包产制度。聊城地区许多农业社还通过制订生产规划，自上而下地全面安排了增产、增收、生产和社员生活开支的计划，这样既能保证国家的需要，也照顾了社员的需要。这个专区的许多农业社为了改变过去对生产队和社员在各方面限制过严过死的现象，今年都给生产队以修订定额的机动权；并特别强调生产队要协助社员家庭规划劳动出勤、副业、积肥和自留地的经营管理工作。
    耕畜不足、瘦弱是山东农村相当普遍的现象，为了扭转这种情况，今年许多农业社实行牲畜保本、保值，加强生产队对牲畜的爱护和喂养，推广包工、包养、包使的经验。许多农业社为贯彻勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，还规定了按季按月规划收支，量入为出、量力而行的制度。
    各地农业社在制订生产计划和研究改进经营管理工作中也发生一些偏向。如部分社在订生产计划时，有宁低勿高的情绪；强调发扬民主就忽视国家计划或者强调国家计划又忽视了因地制宜和社员需要。有些社在包工包产中不发动群众，放松领导，让各队自己定产定工，以致发生产量压低工分提高的现象。这些偏向，各级党政组织正在领导农业社纠正。
    各地已经做完年终分配决算和生产计划以及推行了包工包产的农业社，各项生产都进行得很好，备耕工作已经取得了一定的成绩。仅据全省1月中旬的不完全统计，各地农业社搬冰运雪压麦达到五十四万八千四百多亩，积土肥等二千五百一十三万多车，积大粪、干灰、尿肥二万七千四百二十二万斤，莱阳专区一般每户积肥八十驮（每驮约二百五十斤左右），比去年同期增加十驮。
