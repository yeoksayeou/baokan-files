    Cannot "Save" Like This
    Recently, the ammonium antimony rock explosives allocated to our construction unit by the No. 12 Factory of Fuxin Coal Mine were not packaged in small packages, supposedly to save money. However, this has caused us great waste and threatened our safety.
    Large packages of explosives are highly hygroscopic and difficult to store. At the same time, they must be repackaged into small packages before they can be used. However, we have neither packaging equipment nor skilled packaging personnel, making the small packaging work very difficult. Everyone is also apprehensive when packaging. We believe that this method of saving is inappropriate.

### 不能这样“节约”

    不能这样“节约”
    最近，阜新煤矿第十二厂拨给我们施工单位的铵锑岩石炸药，都没有进行小包装，据说这是为了节约。可是，这却给我们造成了很大浪费，安全也受到威胁。
    炸药大包装吸潮性大，保管困难，同时必须再进行小包装后才能使用。但是，我们既无包装设备，又无熟练的包装人员，小包装的工作进行起来很困难。大家在包装的时候，又都提心吊胆。我们认为，这种节约的办法是不恰当的。
