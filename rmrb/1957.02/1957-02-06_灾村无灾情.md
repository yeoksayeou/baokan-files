Baiyangyu, a remote mountain village in the southern foothills of the Taihang Mountains in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, has been practicing advanced agricultural cooperation for a year. Before the Spring Festival, the reporter visited this mountain village. This place used to be a place with many mountains and little land, and the natural conditions were very poor. Last year, it suffered from floods, hail, and insects that were rare in a century. It was estimated that the lives of the farmers might be very hard. However, when I walked into Baiyangyu Village, I saw a joyous and happy scene. More than one hundred stone mills and grinders in the village were turning day and night; in addition to making a lot of New Year's food, each household also prepared rice and flour for the busy farming season. Although there were still many days before the Spring Festival, groups of children were already on the streets, wearing brightly colored calico clothes and lighting firecrackers. The village supply and marketing cooperative was crowded with customers all day long, and calico,呢帽, coats,粉条, oil, sauce, New Year pictures, etc. were all fast-selling items; the cooperative added goods several times, but it was still in short supply. It is said that some people even went far to the county and township to purchase New Year goods. Late at night, lights were flashing in the windows of each house, and women were busy making new clothes and quilts. In this mountain village with only more than one hundred households, almost everyone added a new set of clothes, and more than sixty flower quilts were made. The village had not built a new house for nearly forty years, but now more than fifty rooms have been built. Most of these new houses have gray tiles and white walls, and are equipped with large glass windows. Most of the owners have already moved into their new homes, and several others are busy painting and installing doors and windows, preparing to move into their new homes for the Spring Festival.

The reporter visited many disaster-stricken farmers for several days and found that their income not only did not decrease, but increased a lot. An ordinary farmer, Wang Wenyan, had suffered three disasters in the past seventeen years. In 1940 and 1946, he relied on selling his property and the relief from the people's government to survive on bran vegetables and tree leaves. Last year, his three acres of good land were washed away by floods, and more than ten acres of sloping land were also hit by hail. In addition, his wife's lung disease broke out. It was really a combination of natural disasters and man-made disasters, poverty and illness. However, after the autumn harvest, he was allocated more than 3,100 kilograms of grain, more than 120 yuan in cash, and a large amount of vegetables. He spent more than 80 yuan to give his wife injections and medicine to stop the development of lung disease. His child, who was less than one year old, was fed milk powder while his mother was sick. Now his family has also added some new clothes and bought meat,粉条, oil, sauce, etc., to prepare for the Spring Festival. Wang Wenyan told reporters that if the advanced cooperative had not abolished private ownership of the means of production, the destruction of his three acres of good land would have broken his family's "old rice bowl." His wife's medical treatment and his child's feeding would have required borrowing more than 100 yuan, which would not have been repaid in three years, let alone ten. In the homes of several cooperative members with similar situations to Wang Wenyan, the reporter saw that every family had plenty of food and clothing, and they were all busy preparing for the Spring Festival, and there was no sign of distress.

There are seven Yang family farmers in the village, all of whom were famine refugees from other provinces in the past. In the five or six decades they have lived here, they have lived by cultivating wasteland and eating wild vegetables. They are the poorest people in the village. After the autumn harvest last year, the seven families of forty people received an average of 452 kilograms of rations and a large amount of cash and vegetables per person; in addition to what they ate and used in a year, there was still a surplus. Yang Bachou worked well and received enough grain to eat for two years, and still had more than 200 yuan in hand. Now he is preparing bricks, tiles, and wood to build a new house after the Spring Festival, to change the life of his ancestors who lived in caves for three generations. Yang Bachou said: "In the past, one year of disaster meant ten years of poverty, but now, relying on advanced cooperation, we are not afraid of natural and man-made disasters!"

Before liberation, when there were disasters and poor harvests, those old, weak, and disabled farmers could only wait to die. Now, the five elderly, widowed, and disabled farmers in Baiyangyu are all "five guarantees" households of the agricultural cooperative. They have all received grain, clothing, coal, and pocket money from the cooperative. Recently, each person also received a few yuan for holiday expenses, some bought oil, salt, and粉条, and some added clothes and socks. Wang Gaiying, an old woman known as "Deaf Old Man," also herds sheep and does other chores for the cooperative, and her income is even higher. When the reporter went to see her, she was making noodles in a room with glass windows. She was wearing clean black cotton clothes, and new clothes for the Spring Festival were placed on the heated brick bed. If it weren't for the lack of children and grandchildren, no one would have thought that she was a "five guarantees" household. Wang Dengchun, a sixty-year-old blind widower, often praised the life of the agricultural cooperative's "old folks' home," and often participated in cooperative meetings, listened to the radio, and read newspapers. He told reporters: "Don't think I'm blind, my heart and ears are good, I know this society is good now!"

Recently, the 52 Vanguard Agricultural Cooperative in Baiyangyu has distributed the last batch of cash to its members. So far, the total income of last year has been settled. The average yield of grain per mu of farmland in the entire cooperative was 411 kilograms, exceeding 1955 by 105%; the forestry income was more than 25,000 yuan, exceeding 1955 by four times; animal husbandry and sideline production also developed. The total income of the entire cooperative overfulfilled the plan, increasing 1.6 times compared with 1955. As a result of the distribution, the income of all 104 households in the cooperative increased. Among them, the income of nine households increased by 600 to 800 yuan compared with 1955, and some increased by one to three times. The income of three old middle peasants, Li Benyu and Chen Bingyi, also increased by more than 60% in the first year of abolishing land dividends. Each person in the entire cooperative retained more than 500 kilograms of rations, an increase of one-fifth compared with 1955. It was originally estimated that the country would need to supply grain after the disaster, but now the entire cooperative has sold more than 15,000 kilograms of surplus grain. Before liberation, whenever there were major disasters or minor difficulties, there would always be families in the village who were ruined and died, and those who remained would have to borrow money to survive and suffer from hunger and poverty. Last year, in addition to repaying all the 600 yuan in loans, the farmers here also deposited more than 3,000 yuan in the credit cooperative. Cui Wenyu had been unable to repay more than 170 yuan in debt due to the funerals of two old people for several years, but he paid it off at once last year. He happily told everyone he met: "I really didn't expect that the advanced cooperative would remove my worries in the first year!"

Why was it possible to avoid disaster despite the disaster? Wang Dianjun, the director of the agricultural cooperative, told me: "It is because our advanced cooperative has implemented the policy of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations!" He said: In terms of agriculture, when sowing in March last year, because the land was dry and there was a shortage of labor, under the guidance of the higher party committee and with the support of the cooperative members, we resolutely stopped cultivating 800 mu of sloping land for afforestation. At the same time, we accepted the criticisms and suggestions of the elderly, expanded the planting area of the high-yield crop "Golden Queen" corn, implemented intercropping and mixed planting of corn fields with beans, and corrected the shortcomings of excessive dense planting in 1955. Therefore, the spring seedlings all emerged very well. After the cultivated area was reduced, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased by more than 20担, and there was strength to strengthen farmland management. After the disaster, replanting and conversion were carried out in a timely manner. During the autumn harvest, we rushed to harvest and thresh, avoiding losses from strong winds. As a result, although the farmland was reduced by 800 mu and more than 300 mu were destroyed by floods, the total grain output was still more than 10,000 kilograms more than in 1955. In terms of forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, production was also very profitable. They have more than 50 laborers engaged in forestry and animal husbandry production for a long time. Therefore, forestry production increased four times compared with 1955; in animal husbandry, selling the old and exchanging for the young, it can be calculated that seven out of ten can be earned.

Wang Dianjun finally repeatedly pointed out the shortcomings in last year's work. He said: "We stopped cultivating 800 mu for afforestation, cutting the cultivated land by half at once, reducing the planting area of oil crops and wheat, and the cooperative members had a lot of opinions. This year, we plan to plant potatoes and oil crops in some of the land that has been stopped for afforestation. In addition, there were more non-productive work last year, and the labor potential was not fully utilized, which made the construction of 300 mu of river beach land difficult." He also said: "There are still many shortcomings, the most important thing is that the leadership cannot keep up. None of the five directors are literate, and there are difficulties in managing finances and improving technology. In addition, we are not good at listening to the opinions of cooperative members, so we have not managed the cooperative better."

    灾村无灾情
      新华社记者　冯建伟
    太行山南麓山西省昔阳县的一个偏僻山村白羊峪，实现农业高级合作化已经有一年了。春节前夕，记者到这个山村作了访问。这里原是山多地薄，自然条件很差的地方，去年又遭受百年来少有的洪水和雹、虫等灾害，估计农民生活可能是很苦的。但是，当我走进白羊峪村里，呈现在眼前的却是一片喜气洋洋的欢乐景象。村里有一百多盘石磨和碾，都在昼夜不停地转动；各家除制作大量年节食品外，还要准备好农忙时吃的米面。尽管离春节还有好多天，街头上早有成群儿童，穿着鲜艳的花布衣服，点燃爆竹。村供销社门口整天拥挤着顾客，花布、呢帽、大衣和粉条、油、酱、年画等都是畅销品；社里添了几次货，还是供不应求。据说有的人还远出到县、乡去办年货。深夜，各家窗口都闪着灯光，妇女们忙着赶作新衣新被。这个只有一百多户的山村，差不多每人都添了一套新衣，单是花被就作了六十多条。村里近四十年没有盖过新房，现在盖了五十多间。这些新房大多是灰瓦白墙，装有大玻璃窗。房主大部分已经搬进新居，还有几户也正在忙着粉刷和安置门窗，准备迁入新居过春节。
    记者连日访问了许多遭灾的农民，发现他们的收入不但没有减少，相反地却增加了不少。一个普通的农户王文彦在最近十七年内三次遭灾。1940年和1946年那两次，他都是依靠变卖家产和人民政府的救济，吃着糠菜树叶度过的。去年原来属于他的三亩好地被水冲坏，十多亩坡地也遭到冰雹的袭击。加上他妻子肺病发作，真是天灾人祸，贫病交加。但是秋收以后，他却分到了三千一百多斤粮食，一百二十多元现款和大量蔬菜。他花了八十多元给妻子打针吃药，制止肺病的发展。他的一个不满周岁的孩子，在母亲养病期间喂着奶粉。现在他一家还添了些新衣，买了肉、粉条、油、酱等，准备过春节。王文彦对记者说，要不是高级社取消生产资料私有制，三亩好地被冲坏就算打破了他一家人的“老饭盆”，妻子看病和孩子喂奶还得借一百多元的债，三年还不清，十年也翻不转身。在情况和王文彦类似的几户社员家里，记者看到家家丰衣足食，都在忙着筹办过春节，一点也看不出有什么愁苦的样子。
    村里有七户杨姓农民，都是过去外省来的逃荒户。他们住在这里的五六十年中，都过着开山荒吃野菜的日子，是村里最穷苦的人。去年秋收以后，七家四十口人平均每人分到了四百五十二斤口粮和大批现款、蔬菜；除一年吃用外，还有富余。杨八丑劳动好，分到的粮食够吃两年，手里还存两百多元。现在他正筹办砖瓦木料，准备春节后盖新房，改变祖辈三代穴居山洞的生活。杨八丑说：“过去一年受灾十年穷，现在依靠高级合作化，天灾人祸都不怕！”
    解放以前，遇到灾荒歉年，那些老弱残废农民只有等死。现在，白羊峪五户孤寡老残农民都是农业社的“五保”户。他们都从社里领到了粮食、衣服、煤炭和零花钱。最近，每人还有几元过节费，有的买了油盐粉条，有的添补了衣服和鞋袜。被人称为“聋老人”的王改英老妈妈，还给社里放羊和做其他杂活，收入就更多。记者去看她的时候，她正在一间有玻璃窗的房子里赶面条。她身上穿着干净的黑布棉衣，炕上还放着春节穿的新衣服。如果不是跟前缺少儿孙，谁也想不到她是“五保”户。双目失明的六十岁老鳏夫王登春，常常对人夸赞农业社“养老院”的生活，还经常参加社里开会、听广播、读报。他对记者说：“别看我眼瞎了，心灵耳乖，我知道现在这社会对哟！”
    最近，白羊峪的五二先锋农业社已经把最后一批现款分给社员。至此，去年总收益便结算完毕。全社农田平均每亩产粮食四百十一斤，超过1955年105％；林业收入两万五千多元，超过1955年四倍；畜牧业和副业生产也都有发展。全社总收益超额完成计划，比1955年增加一点六倍。分配的结果，全社一百零四户，户户增加收入。其中有九户的收入比1955年增加六百元到八百元，有的增加一倍到三倍。李本玉、陈炳义等三户老中农，在取消土地分红的头一年，收入也增加60％以上。全社每口人留口粮五百多斤，比1955年增加五分之一。原来估计受灾后需要由国家供应粮食，现在全社反而出售余粮一万五千多斤。解放以前，每遇大灾小难，村里总有倾家荡产、家破人亡的，留下来的人也要借债度日和挨饿受穷。去年这里的农民除偿还全部六百多元借款外，还存入信用社三千多元。崔文玉过去因出葬两个老人而拖欠的一百七十多元债款，几年还不了，去年一次还清。他高兴地见人就说：“真没想到高级社头一年就摘了我的愁帽！”
    为什么能够遭灾不成灾呢？农业社主任王殿俊告诉我：“就是因为咱高级社贯彻了农、林、牧、副业全面发展的方针！”他说：农业方面，去年3月播种的时候，因为地里干旱，劳动力不足，所以在上级党委的指示和社员们的支持下，坚决把八百亩坡地停耕造林。同时，接受老人们的批评建议，扩大高产作物“金皇后”玉米的种植面积，实行玉米地带豆等间作混种，改正1955年过分密植的缺点。因此，春苗都出的很齐全。耕地面积缩小以后，每亩施肥量相对增加了二十多担，并且有力量加强了农田管理。遭灾以后，及时补种、改种。秋收的时候抢收抢打，避免了刮大风抛撒损失。结果，虽然农田减少八百亩，又被水冲毁三百多亩，粮食总产量还是比1955年多一万多斤。在林业、畜牧业和副业方面，生产也都很得利。他们有五十多个劳动力长期搞林业和畜牧业生产。所以，林业生产就比1955年增加了四倍；畜牧业卖老的、换小的，计算下来十个里头也能赚七个。
      王殿俊最后再三指明去年工作中的缺点。他说：“我们停耕造林八百亩，一下把耕地砍掉一半，缩小了油料作物和小麦的种植面积，社员们很有意见。今年准备在一部分停耕造林的地里种植马铃薯和油料作物。另外，去年非生产用工多了些，劳动潜力也发挥得不够，使三百亩河滩地的修建发生了困难。”他又说：“缺点还有很多，最主要的是领导赶不上去。五个主任都不识字，管理财务和改良技术都有困难，再加上倾听社员意见差一点，所以就没有把社办得更好。”
