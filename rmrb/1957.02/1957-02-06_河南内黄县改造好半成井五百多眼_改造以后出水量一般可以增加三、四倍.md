Neihuang County, Henan Province, Has Improved More Than 500 "Half-Finished" Wells
　　Output After Improvement Can Generally Increase Three to Four Times

　　(Our dispatch) According to statistics from early January, Neihuang County, Henan Province, has improved more than 530 "half-finished" wells, accounting for more than half of the total number of "half-finished" wells the county expects to improve before this year's spring plowing. According to Li Hengcai, Deputy County Chief of Neihuang County, the water depth of the improved "half-finished" wells generally increased by five to eight *shi chi* (尺, a traditional Chinese unit of length, roughly equivalent to 1/3 of a meter), and the water output generally increased three to four times.

　　During the upsurge of farmland water conservancy construction in the winter of 1955 and spring of 1956, Neihuang County dug more than 13,100 wells and purchased 4,050 waterwheels. As a result, the area benefiting from water conservancy in Neihuang County increased from 20,000 *mu* (亩, a Chinese unit of area, roughly equivalent to 1/15 of a hectare) to 300,000 *mu*. However, half of these existing wells were "half-finished" wells.

　　Neihuang County had formulated a plan for the improvement of "half-finished" wells: to improve 2,000 wells from after the wheat harvest in 1956 to the wheat harvest in 1957; and to improve the rest from after the wheat harvest in 1957 to the wheat harvest in 1958. All 5,400 "half-finished" wells will be completely improved within three years.

　　In order to promote this work, the leading departments of Neihuang County successively held five training classes, training more than 350 farmer water conservancy technicians; and organized four visits in Chengguan, Jingdian, Dongzhuang, Chuwang and other places, with a total of 3,000 people. Now almost every agricultural cooperative in Neihuang County has a farmer water conservancy technician who can improve "half-finished" wells.

　　This county has discovered many good methods for improving "half-finished" wells in the process of improving them. The method of sinking brick cylinders for well construction, which can be used to improve "half-finished" wells and build new wells and is now being promoted in Henan Province, was developed and improved by drawing on the experience of Neihuang and other places.

### 河南内黄县改造好半成井五百多眼  改造以后出水量一般可以增加三、四倍

    河南内黄县改造好半成井五百多眼
    改造以后出水量一般可以增加三、四倍
    本报讯　根据1月上旬的统计，河南省内黄县已改造了半成井五百三十多眼，占该县预计今年春耕前改造半成井总数的一半以上。据内黄县副县长李恒才说，经过改造的半成井的水深一般增加五市尺到八市尺、出水量一般增加三、四倍。
    内黄县在1955年冬季和1956年春季的兴修农田水利高潮当中，打了一万三千一百多眼水井、购置了四千零五十部水车。内黄县的水利效益面积因此由两万亩增加到三十万亩。但是这些已打的水井当中有半数是半成井。
    内黄县在改造半成井工作上曾制定了一个计划：由1956年麦收以后到1957年麦收改造好两千眼；其他的在1957年麦收以后到1958年麦收改造。三年内把五千四百眼半成井全部改造完。
    为了推动这一工作，内黄县领导部门先后举办了五次训练班，训练了三百五十多个农民水利技术员；在成关、井店、东庄、楚旺等地组织了四次总数有三千人的参观，现在内黄县差不多每个农业社都有一个会改造半成井的农民水利技术员了。
    这个县在改造半成井当中发现了不少改造半成井的好方法。现在在河南省推广的可以改造半成井，也可以修建新井的下砖套筒的打井法，就是吸取内黄等地的经验经过提高而产生的。
