Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 20th -- During the Italian Socialist Party's congress held from February 6th to 10th, the Italian Communist Party's organ "L'Unità" published a series of articles commenting on the congress and its central issue – the merger of the Socialist Party with the Social Democratic Party.

On February 6th, the opening day of the congress, "L'Unità" published an editorial focusing on the relationship between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The editorial recounted that since the leaders of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party began discussing the merger of the two parties (last August), it had been announced that the united action agreement between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party had gradually become ineffective; and that as soon as the consultation agreement between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party was born (last October), it was shelved, "while the Socialist Party comrades – especially Nenni – increasingly and vehemently attacked some of the fundamental positions of Leninism, and the great revolutionary movement nurtured by Leninism." The editorial emphasized that this "is the most serious rift in the cooperation between the two parties from 1948 to today," and that this rift is detrimental to the merger of the Socialist Party, making the merger more difficult and complicated. This is because it became a weakness for the Socialist Party in its negotiations with the Social Democratic Party, thereby encouraging the Social Democratic Party to strengthen its original anti-Soviet and anti-communist stance. The editorial stated: "Any weakening of the cooperation between the left-wing forces in the Italian workers' movement, thereby weakening the unity of the working class, objectively opens the way for the right wing of the Social Democratic Party and the general right wing to reorganize. Precisely for the merger of the Socialist Party, the crisis in the relationship between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party means a serious loss."

In view of the Italian Socialist Party's contribution and role in the Italian workers' movement, the editorial hoped that the Socialist Party's congress "will take clear action to overcome this dangerous situation (at present)."

On the 7th, "L'Unità" published a short article entitled "Nenni Makes Further Concessions to the Social Democratic Party," commenting on Nenni's political report at the congress, and published a statement by Pajetta, who represented the Italian Communist Party at the Socialist Party congress, to reporters. Pajetta pointed out: "The policies announced in this speech, regardless of their original intention, may cause serious damage to the workers' movement." Then, on the 8th, "L'Unità" published an article entitled "The Problem Has Not Been Resolved," commenting on this report.

The article pointed out the dangers contained in Nenni's report. It said: "With what real strength, on what class relations, and on what balance of power is a 'socialist transformation' policy to be established and the program to achieve this policy implemented? Nenni's report essentially does not address this issue, although it is extremely important." The article said, "In order to make up for this deficiency, Nenni resorted to all emotional factors: he launched an extraordinary anti-Soviet and anti-communist polemic," "in fact equating socialist countries with imperialism."

The article finally warned that it would be difficult to exchange a seat in the Italian bourgeois government by abandoning mass struggle, splitting with the Communists, and harming trade union unity.

On the 9th, "L'Unità" once again published an article commenting on the congress. The article stated: "The congress seems to have revealed two essentially universal and opposing tendencies. Both tendencies put forward this correct demand: that the Socialist Party adopt new and active policies,... but one of these tendencies advocates that active policies should be truly socialist policies,... that they should be linked to the real movement of the masses, and therefore to the domestic and international balance of power and class relations, and therefore, it should have an undisguised content of unity. It is on these bases that this tendency seeks the merger of the Socialist Party. This tendency is certainly the one that prevailed at the congresses held in the provinces, and it is in line with the deeper experiences of the workers' and peasants' base of the (Socialist) Party.

"The other tendency, on the contrary, advocates policies that require concessions to possible pressures,... and has such an 'upper' nature: making concessions to the Social Democratic Party beyond what it can allow, not letting go of any anti-communist demands, and not connecting with the actions of the masses and the real problems to be solved." The article pointed out that it is precisely this tendency that the bourgeois newspapers hope will prevail.

    意共机关报“团结报”撰文
    评社会党同共产党关系等问题
    新华社20日讯　罗马消息：在2月6日到10日意大利社会党举行代表大会期间，意大利共产党机关报“团结报”接连发表文章，评论这次代表大会和大会的中心议题——社会党同社会民主党合并的问题。
    在2月6日代表大会开幕的这一天，“团结报”发表了一篇社论，着重地谈到了社会党和共产党的关系。社论追述说，从（去年8月）社会党和社会民主党领袖开始商谈两党合并问题以后，人们就宣布社会党和共产党之间的一致行动协定已经逐渐失效；而在（去年10月）社会党和共产党之间的协商协定刚一诞生，人们就把它束之高阁，“同时，社会党同志们——首先是南尼同志——对列宁主义的若干根本立场，对列宁主义所孕育的伟大革命运动，日益加剧地予以激烈的抨击”。社论强调指出，这“是两党从1948年到今天的合作中的最严重的裂痕”，而这种裂痕是不利于社会党合并的，使得合并更加困难了，也复杂化了。因为这成了社会党在同社会民主党谈判中的弱点，从而鼓励了社会民主党加强它原来的反苏反共的立场。社论说：意大利工人运动中“左派力量互相合作的任何削弱，从而使得劳动阶级团结削弱，在客观上就开放了社会民主党右翼和一般右派重整旗鼓的道路。正是对于社会党合并来说，社会党和共产党关系中的危机意味着一个严重的损失。”
    鉴于意大利社会党对于意大利工人运动的贡献和作用，社论希望社会党这次代表大会“能够采取明确的行动来致力于克服（目前）这种危险情势”。
    7日，“团结报”刊载了一篇以“南尼向社会民主党再次让步”为题的短文，评述南尼在代表大会上作的政治报告，并且登载了代表意大利共产党参加社会党代表大会的巴叶塔向记者发表的谈话。巴叶塔指出：“这篇演说所宣布的政策，不管其本意如何，可能对工人运动造成严重的损害。”接着，“团结报”又在8日发表了一篇题为“问题没有得到解决”的文章，评论了这个报告。
    文章指出了南尼的报告所包藏的危险。它说：“人们希望以怎样的真实力量、在怎样的阶级关系上，在怎样的力量对比关系上建立一种‘社会主义转变’政策和实现这种政策的纲领呢？南尼的报告实质上没有谈到这个问题，虽然这是极为重要的。”文章说，“为了弥补这一缺陷，南尼求助于一切激情因素：他掀起了不寻常的反苏反共论战”，“事实上把社会主义国家同帝国主义等量齐观”。
    文章最后警告说，想用放弃群众斗争、同共产党人分裂及危害工会统一的方法来换取在意大利资产阶级政府中的席位，这是困难的。
    9日，“团结报”再次载文评论了这次代表大会。文章说：“代表大会似乎出现了本质上具有普遍性的、互相对立的两种倾向。这两种倾向都提出了这种正确的要求：要求社会党采取新的主动的政策，……但是其中一种倾向主张主动的政策应该是真正社会主义的政策，……它应该同群众的真实运动，因而同国内和国际力量对比及阶级关系相联系，因此，它应该毫不隐晦地具有团结的内容。这一倾向正是在这些基础上谋求社会党合并的。这一倾向肯定是在各省举行代表大会时占上风的倾向，它是符合（社会）党的工农基层的比较深刻的经验的。
    “另一种倾向则相反，它所主张的政策要求向可能的压力让步，……具有这样一种‘上层’的性质：向社会民主党作出超出自己所能容许的范围的让步，不放过任何反共的要求，而且不同群众的行动和待解决的真实问题相联系。”文章指出：资产阶级报纸所希望的正是这种倾向占上风。
