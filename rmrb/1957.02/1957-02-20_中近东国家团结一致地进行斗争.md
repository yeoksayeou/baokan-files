Middle Eastern countries unite in struggle
After the failure of the Anglo-French colonialists' war of aggression against Egypt, the colonial system in the Middle East is further disintegrating, the national independence movement has seen new developments, and more favorable conditions exist for the peaceful resolution of international problems in the Middle East. However, the failure of Britain and France has also caused a major change in the balance of power between imperialism and the Middle East, and US imperialism is ambitiously attempting to replace the position of Britain and France and turn the entire Middle East into its own sphere of influence. The various activities carried out by the United States recently to achieve this arrogant goal have greatly threatened the independence and security of Middle Eastern countries and have made the situation in the Middle East tense again.

After the Anglo-French forces were forced to withdraw from Egypt, the Israeli forces, which had invaded Egypt together with Britain and France, still occupy part of Egyptian territory, which is a serious obstacle to restoring peace in the Middle East. Despite repeated demands from Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and the United Nations for the Israeli invaders to withdraw from Egypt, the United States, Britain, and France, harboring their own selfish purposes, support Israel's reckless behavior either openly or secretly. The United States plays a particularly insidious role in this regard. US Secretary of State Dulles has proposed a so-called two-point plan to Israel to resolve the issue of Israeli troop withdrawal. One point is that the United States is prepared to send merchant ships into the Gulf of Aqaba, forcibly "internationalizing" Egypt's territorial waters in the Gulf of Aqaba, and ensuring that Israeli ships can freely pass through the Egyptian blockade line. The other point of this plan is that, as a condition for the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the United States advocates stationing a large number of United Nations forces or observers in the Gaza Strip, and these United Nations forces should only withdraw from Egyptian territory after the Suez Canal issue and the Israeli-Arab disputes are resolved. What is the purpose of these actions by the United States? First, it wants to complicate the issue in order to continue to maintain the tense situation in the Middle East and retain a position in the region where the United States can intervene at any time. Second, the United States wants to turn Israel into a sword constantly hanging over the heads of Arab countries, using it to put pressure on Egypt and force Egypt to accept the various schemes of Western colonial countries for the so-called "international management" of the Suez Canal. Third, according to the American press, the United States is encouraging Israel to invade Egypt's territory and territorial waters because the United States is preparing to build a new oil pipeline from the Gulf of Aqaba through Israel to the Mediterranean Sea in order to expand the plunder of Middle Eastern oil by American monopoly capital groups.

The US practice of encouraging and using Israel is only one of the important means of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" for carrying out a comprehensive aggression against Middle Eastern countries. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to use military, political, and economic means to place Middle Eastern countries one by one under the control and enslavement of the United States and turn them into objects of plunder and military bases for the United States. Although the United States has been forced to repeatedly revise the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in order to ease opposition from all sides, its main content remains military threats and the crude interference in the sovereignty and internal affairs of various countries.

In order to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States wrapped its shells in a layer of sugar coating, trying to use economic aid to lure and win over some Middle Eastern countries. The United States also inherited the British colonialists' "divide and rule" policy in the Middle East, carrying out all kinds of divisive activities against Middle Eastern countries. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" first boosted the morale of the Baghdad Pact countries. American bourgeois commentator Lippmann wrote: "These countries originally hoped that the United States would join the Baghdad Pact, and this new policy seems in every way to be equivalent to our participation in the Baghdad Pact, only under a different name." Therefore, the United States is preparing to give Iraq and other countries more military "aid" and strengthen political and economic activities in these countries, attempting to expand the antagonism between the Baghdad Pact countries and non-Baghdad Pact countries in this way. At the same time, the United States is also carrying out sabotage activities among those Arab countries that have not joined military blocs. During the visit of the King of Saudi Arabia to the United States, the United States openly provoked the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Egypt. US "Newsweek" revealed: "Washington hopes that Saudi Arabia will join the Western Baghdad Pact. In this way, Nasser will be surrounded...." It is clear that the US policy is to try to divide the Middle Eastern countries so that it can manipulate them from within.

While threatening, enticing, and dividing, the United States is also carrying out despicable attacks, sabotage, and subversive activities against Arab governments that implement a peaceful and independent policy. Statements hostile to the Nasser government often appear in the American press. Not long ago, conspirators who had attempted to launch a coup in Syria confessed in military court that they had close ties with Americans. The United States was also found to be secretly supporting the conspiracy of Iraq and Israel to carve up Jordanian territory. United Press International openly said: Jordan "has no future as an independent country." According to Israel's "Haaretz," government officials in Washington have even discussed the question of "whether Israel's attempt to occupy western Jordan is possible"!

These colonial expansion activities of the United States seriously infringe upon the independent sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries, and at the same time, they are gradually squeezing out the colonial interests of Britain and France in the Middle East. However, so far, Britain and France have apparently not learned a lesson from the failure of their own aggression, nor have they learned a lesson from the fact that they have been repeatedly squeezed out and insulted by the United States. They still want to use the power of the United States to retain and restore the privileges of colonial rule, or to fuel the current tense situation in the Middle East in order to profit from it. This is certainly extremely unwise, and the result will be that they will fall into an even more unfavorable position.

The current development of the Middle East situation cannot but attract the attention of people of all countries. The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on February 11 demonstrated the due concern for the Middle East situation. The note put forward six principles, including resolving disputes peacefully and not interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries, and suggested that all countries should abide by these principles in their relations with Middle Eastern countries. This statement by the Soviet Union has been warmly supported by Middle Eastern Arab countries and all peace-loving countries. The statement issued by our government on February 17 pointed out: "The realization of the Soviet proposal will eliminate external factors that threaten and undermine peace and security in the Middle East, and ensure the independence and security of Middle Eastern countries." Therefore, we believe that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have no reason to reject this proposal from the Soviet Union.

In order to prevent the deterioration of the Middle East situation, and in order to safeguard the independence and security of Middle Eastern countries, the greatest common interest of Middle Eastern countries at present is to break the imperialist conspiracy of division and unite better, so as to carry out the common struggle against colonial aggression with renewed efforts. The main driving force that determines the development of the Middle East situation lies in the Middle Eastern countries themselves, not in London or Washington. As long as Middle Eastern countries unite and struggle, they will surely continue to gain new victories, and the colonialists will surely continue to suffer shameful defeats.

### 中近东国家团结一致地进行斗争

    中近东国家团结一致地进行斗争
    在英法殖民者发动侵略埃及战争遭到失败以后，中近东的殖民体系正在进一步瓦解，民族独立运动有了新的发展，和平解决中近东地区的国际问题具备了比较有利的条件。但是，英法的失败也造成了帝国主义在中近东地区力量对比的重大变化，美帝国主义正在野心勃勃地企图代替英法的地位，把整个中近东变为它自己的势力范围。最近期间美国为了实现这种狂妄的目的而进行的种种活动，已使中近东国家的独立和安全遭受极大的威胁，并使中近东地区的局势又重趋紧张。
    在英法部队被迫撤出埃及以后，同英法一起侵略埃及的以色列部队至今仍然霸占着埃及的一部分领土，这是恢复中近东和平的一个严重的障碍。尽管阿拉伯国家和亚非各国人民以及联合国组织一再要求以色列侵略者撤出埃及，但是美英法却怀着各自的自私目的，或明或暗地支持以色列蛮干下去。美国在这方面扮演着特别阴险的角色。美国国务卿杜勒斯已经向以色列提出所谓解决以色列撤兵问题的两点计划。一点是：美国准备派商船闯进亚喀巴湾，强使亚喀巴湾的埃及领海“国际化”，保证以色列船只可以自由地通过埃及封锁线。这个计划的另一点是：作为以色列部队撤退的条件，美国主张在加沙地带驻扎大量的联合国部队或观察员，而且要使这些联合国部队在苏伊士运河问题和以色列—阿拉伯纠纷问题解决以后才撤出埃及领土。美国这些做法的目的是什么呢？第一，它想把问题复杂化，以便继续保持中近东的紧张局势，并在这个地区保留一个美国可以随时进行干涉的阵地。第二，美国想把以色列变为经常悬在阿拉伯国家头上的一支剑，利用它对埃及施加压力，迫使埃及接受西方殖民国家的所谓“国际管理”苏伊士运河的种种计谋。第三，据美国报刊透露，美国所以怂恿以色列侵犯埃及的领土和领海，还因为美国准备修筑一条新的输油管，从亚喀巴湾穿过以色列通到地中海，以便扩大美国垄断资本集团对中东石油的掠夺。
    美国怂恿和利用以色列的做法还只是对中近东国家进行全面侵略的“艾森豪威尔主义”的重要手段之一。“艾森豪威尔主义”是要用军事的、政治的和经济的种种手段，把中近东国家一个一个地都放在美国的控制和奴役之下，把它们变为美国的掠夺对象和军事基地。尽管美国为了缓和各方面的反对，被迫把“艾森豪威尔主义”一再涂改，但是它的主要内容仍然是军事威胁和对各国主权和内政的粗暴干涉。
    为了推行“艾森豪威尔主义”，美国把它的炮弹包上了一层糖衣，想用经济援助来引诱和拉拢某些中近东国家。美国还继承了英国殖民者在中近东的“分而治之”的政策，对中近东国家进行了千方百计的分裂活动。“艾森豪威尔主义”首先给巴格达条约国家打气。美国资产阶级政论家李普曼写道：“这些国家本来就希望美国参加巴格达条约，而这次新政策从各方面看来就等于是我们参加了巴格达条约，只不过是用另外的名义而已”。因此美国正准备给伊拉克等国更多的军事“援助”，并加强在这些国家的政治和经济活动，企图这样来扩大巴格达条约国家同非巴格达条约国家的对立。同时，美国还在那些没有参加军事集团的阿拉伯国家之间进行破坏活动。在沙特阿拉伯国王访问美国的时候，美国露骨地挑拨沙特阿拉伯同埃及的关系。美国“新闻周刊”透露说：“华盛顿希望沙特参加西方的巴格达条约。这样一来，纳赛尔就会被围起来……。”很明显，美国的政策是企图把中近东国家弄得四分五裂，以便从中操纵。
    在威胁、利诱和分化的同时，美国对于实行和平独立政策的阿拉伯各国政府，更进行卑鄙的打击、破坏和颠覆活动。敌视纳赛尔政府的言论经常出现在美国报刊上。不久以前，曾经企图在叙利亚发动政变的阴谋分子在军事法庭上供认，他们同美国人有密切联系。在伊拉克和以色列妄想割裂约旦领土的阴谋活动中，也发现美国在暗中支持。合众社公开说：约旦“没有成为一个独立国家的前途”。据以色列“国土报”报道，华盛顿的政府人士甚至讨论过“以色列企图侵占约旦西部是否可能”的问题！
    美国这些殖民扩张的活动，严重地侵犯了中近东国家的独立主权，同时也一步步地排挤着英法在中近东的殖民利益。但是，迄今为止，英法显然还没有从自己侵略行动的失败中吸取教训，还没有从一再受到美国的排挤和侮辱的事实中吸取教训。它们还想借助美国的力量来保留和恢复殖民统治的特权，或者助长目前中东的紧张局势，以便从中取利。这当然是极不明智的，结果将使自己陷于更加不利的地位。
    目前中近东局势的发展，不能不引起各国人民的注视。苏联政府在2月11日递交给美、英、法三国政府的照会，表现了对中近东局势应有的关心。这个照会提出了关于用和平方法解决争执问题和不干涉中近东国家内政等六项原则，并建议各国在同中近东国家的关系中能够遵行这些原则。苏联这一声明得到中东阿拉伯国家以及一切爱好和平国家的热烈支持。我国政府在2月17日发表的声明中指出：“苏联建议的实现，将会消除威胁和破坏中近东和平和安全的外来因素，使中近东各国的独立和安全得到保障。”因此，我们认为，美、英、法三国政府没有任何理由拒绝苏联的这个建议。
    为了制止中近东局势的恶化，为了维护中近东国家的独立和安全，目前中近东国家的最大的共同利益就是要打破帝国主义的分裂阴谋，更好地团结起来，以便再接再厉地进行反对殖民侵略的共同斗争。决定中近东局势发展的主要动力在中近东国家本身，而不在伦敦或华盛顿。只要中近东国家团结一致地进行斗争，它们必将继续得到新的胜利，殖民主义者必将继续遭到可耻的失败。
