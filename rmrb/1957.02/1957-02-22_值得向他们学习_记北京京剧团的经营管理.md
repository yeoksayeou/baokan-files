    Worth Learning From Them
    ——On the Management of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe
    Sun Shikai
    "In the old days, opera troupes had a saying: 'Better to command a thousand soldiers than lead a single troupe.' Today, the management of private professional opera troupes is not what it used to be." After Ma Lianliang, head of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, said this, I became very interested in understanding their troupe's organization. I discovered that this private professional troupe of 188 people only had six full-time administrative staff, with other administrative work being handled by actors, musicians, and stage personnel. Because they are good at flexibly allocating roles, they not only guarantee daily performances but sometimes also form two performance teams. This stands in stark contrast to some state-owned troupes.
    This largest private professional troupe in Beijing (of the cooperative type) has such a lean organization not because of the "patriarchal" management of some old opera troupes. It has a relatively complete set of management systems, and the troupe life is full of vigor. A troupe committee composed of 19 people, including publicly elected veteran actors, young actors, musicians, and stage staff, implements collective leadership, meeting every half month to study and decide on major issues such as the troupe's development and performance plans. For example, at the troupe committee meeting on the 14th, they discussed and decided on the annual business work plan and further reorganization of the troupe, requiring actors to abandon the "idolizing stars" style left over from old opera troupes, with most actors (except the four heads and deputy heads) undertaking the obligation of playing extras and palace maids. Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Zhang Junqiu, and Qiu Shengrong serve as heads and deputy heads, respectively leading artistic, learning, and business work. Ma Fulu, an old actor and famous clown trained in the Fu Liancheng Third Division in his early years, leads the art committee, specifically leading the rehearsal and review of new plays. Cultural instructors, who are also actors, use their spare time to open cultural study classes, and many illiterate members of the troupe who have been studying opera since childhood participate in the learning.
    When Tan Shixiu and Hao You, deputy directors of the troupe office, introduced the situation to me, they spoke of the role of the troupe's organizational structure and personnel allocation, as well as the artistic cultivation of the members, as if enumerating family treasures. It turned out that they were not full-time administrative staff either, but the drummers and gong players on the "stage." They said: Our four heads and deputy heads mainly concentrate on studying and researching plays, and handling some principled issues. The office is responsible for the troupe's daily specific affairs, directly leading the actors' team, stage crew, music team, performance section, and general affairs section. The organizational structure is completely established according to the needs of artistic production units, so handling affairs is very simple and rapid. A few days ago, the troupe committee decided to recruit several young martial arts actors and female Dan students according to the development needs of the performed repertoire. I personally saw their office carry out this work in the troupe, and it was indeed very simple.
    People have this doubt: Do the leadership roles of famous actors like Ma Lianliang affect their performances and the improvement of artistic quality? Facts show that audiences appreciate many of their plays every month, which is no less than before, and their performance level has not decreased. Once, I met Qiu Shengrong, the deputy head of the troupe, and talked about this issue of concern to people. He replied more directly: "Although the troupe is run by everyone as masters, we cannot say that taking on leadership work has no impact on business, but it can be completely resolved if arranged properly." He also gave examples to illustrate his views. Since the establishment of the troupe, their four heads and deputy heads have been able to complete the 14 to 18 performances stipulated by the troupe every month, and last year they also had time to rehearse new plays such as "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage" and "Looking at the River Pavilion." In the future, as long as the performance dates are slightly concentrated, more time can be freed up to study and rehearse new plays, and there will be time to guide young actors.
    Don't many of our state-owned troupes receive a lot of government subsidies every year? This private professional troupe has consistently maintained the fine tradition of diligence and thrift in business management, and it is completely self-sufficient. When an actor introduced the troupe's economic situation, he said with a proud tone: "Our troupe is responsible for its own profits and losses. Now the monthly expenditure is more than 40,000 yuan, which does not require government loans or subsidies." In fact, the troupe's monthly income, after deducting expenses, still leaves public accumulation funds, welfare funds, and depreciation fees for costumes and props.
    In order to guarantee the actors' salary income, the troupe has implemented a "six-four" base salary profit-sharing system based on work, which is superior to the daily "share system" and the monthly fixed salary system. It not only guarantees a certain income for all members of the troupe, but also promotes everyone's enthusiasm and creativity. In January, Zhang Junqiu was originally scheduled to perform 18 shows. He felt that he had the energy and time, so he took the initiative to request an additional show, and said that he would add a few more shows in the future. General actors are also willing to go on stage more to improve their artistic level through practice. For a long time, the average attendance rate of performances with major actors participating has reached 95%, which guarantees a certain monthly income for the troupe. The troupe also has a good labor insurance and welfare system, and troupe members enjoy certain welfare benefits for marriage, funerals, and childbirth. The troupe is fully responsible for medical expenses for injuries sustained on duty.
    In the troupe, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture has sent a guidance group to provide long-term political and business guidance, helping artists improve their business management methods, and enrich and expand the repertoire. The Beijing Municipal Opera and Drama Creation Committee, like guiding more than 20 private professional troupes in Beijing, is also a valuable force supporting the troupe, regularly providing scripts and sending directors to help rehearse new plays. The guidance group has also helped the troupe establish Party and League organizations, and artists have a better political life, and everyone is united like a rock, which powerfully guarantees the healthy development of the troupe.

    值得向他们学习
    ——记北京京剧团的经营管理
    孙世恺
    “过去的戏班有句话：‘宁管千军，不领一班。’如今，民间职业剧团的经营管理却非昔比了。”北京京剧团团长马连良谈过这样的话以后，我很有兴趣地去了解他们剧团的编制，发现这个拥有一百八十八人的民间职业剧团，只有六个专职的行政人员，其他事务工作全由演员、音乐和舞台工作人员兼任。由于他们善于灵活调配角色，不仅保证每天都有演出，有时还要组成两个演出队。它和某些国营剧团却成了显明的对照。
    这个北京最大的民间职业剧团（共和班式的）编制得如此精干，并非过去某些旧戏班子“家长制”的管理。它有一套比较完整的经营管理制度，剧团生活朝气勃勃。由公选的老演员、青年演员、音乐舞台工作人员等十九人组成团委会实行集体领导，每半月开一次会，研究和决定剧团兴革和演出计划等重大问题。如在14日的团委会会议上，讨论和决定了全年业务工作计划和进一步整理剧团的方案，要求演员取消旧戏班遗留下来的“捧角”作风，绝大部分演员（除四个正副团长外）都担负扮龙套、宫女义务。马连良和谭富英、张君秋、裘盛戎任正副团长，分别领导艺术、学习和业务工作。早年从富连成三科培养出来的老演员、名丑马富禄领导艺术委员会，具体领导排练和审查新戏的活动。由演员兼任的文化教员利用业余时间开设了文化学习班，剧团内许多自幼入科学戏的文盲都参加了学习。
    剧团办公室副主任谭世秀、郝友向我介绍情况时，谈到剧团组织机构的作用和人员配备，以及团员艺术修养等，如数家珍一般熟悉。原来他俩也不是专职行政人员，是“场子”上的司鼓和司锣。他们说：我们四个正副团长主要是集中精力考虑研究戏，处理一些原则性的问题。办公室负责剧团日常具体事务工作，直接领导演员队、舞台工作队、音乐队、演出科和总务科。组织机构完全按照艺术生产单位的需要而设立，办事就非常简捷迅速。前几天，团委会根据上演剧目的发展需要，决定吸收几名青年武戏演员和旦角女学员。我在剧团里亲眼看到他们的办公室主持这项工作，果然十分简便。
    人们有这样的怀疑：马连良等名演员都担负剧团的领导工作，是否影响他们的演出和提高艺术质量呢？事实表明，观众每月都欣赏到他们许多戏，并不比过去少或表演水平降低了。有一次，我遇见剧团副团长裘盛戎，又谈起人们所关切的这个问题，他回答得更干脆：“剧团虽是大家当家作主，我们担负领导工作不能说毫不影响业务，但是要安排得好完全能解决这个矛盾”。他还举例说明自己的看法。从剧团成立以来，他们四个正副团长每月都能很好地完成剧团所规定的十四场至十八场演出任务，去年还有时间排演了“三顾茅庐”和“望江亭”等新戏。今后只要把演出日期稍集中，可腾出更多的时间研究和排演新戏，又有功夫指导青年演员了。
    我们许多国营剧团每年不是要政府补贴不少经费吗？这个民间职业剧团在经营管理上一贯保持勤俭节约的优良传统，完全作到自给自足。有个演员介绍剧团经济情况时带着自豪的语气说：“我们剧团是自负盈亏，现在每月开支四万多元，既不需要政府的贷款，也不用补贴。”事实上，这个剧团每月收入除去开支还留有公积金、福利基金和服装道具折旧费等。
    剧团为保证演员的工资收入，实行了按劳取酬的“六四”基薪分红制，较每天“分份制”和每月固定薪金制都优越，既保证全剧团人员一定的收入，又促进大家的积极性和创造性。1月里，张君秋原定十八场戏，他觉得自己有精力和时间，主动要求增演一场戏，并表示今后再多增演几场。一般演员也愿意多登台通过实践提高自己的艺术水平。长期以来，有主要演员参加的演出平均上座率都达到95％，这样就保证剧团每月有一定的收入。这个剧团还有较好的劳保福利制度，团员的婚、丧、生育都享受一定的福利待遇。因公致伤由剧团全部负责医药费。
    在剧团里，有北京市文化局派去一个辅导小组，长期在政治上和业务上进行辅导，帮助艺人们改善经营管理方法，丰富和扩大上演剧目。北京市戏曲编导委员会也如同辅导北京市二十多个民间职业剧团一样，是支持这个剧团的一股可贵的力量，经常供给剧本和派导演帮助排新戏。辅导小组还帮助这个剧团建立起党、团组织，在艺人中有较好的政治生活，大家团结如坚石，有力地保证了剧团健康的发展。
