    From Zhengzhou, February 11th – "If spring production can be done well, increased production is secure!" The members of the Xingning Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingning Township, Xinxiang County, Henan Province, have put forward the slogan of stepping up preparations for spring planting.

    As soon as the Spring Festival was over, the members of the Xingning Agricultural Cooperative took off their new clothes and participated in the preparations for spring planting. Those skilled in ironwork are busy repairing farm tools; those who can do carpentry are busy modifying seed drills; forty-two iron-wheeled carts are carrying manure to the land for sowing cotton; fifty strong young men are accumulating fertilizer; and three hundred and sixty-eight male and female members are digging drainage ditches. In the fields, one can also see teams of people picking cotton seeds and repairing wheat field canals in preparation for spring irrigation. A busy spring preparation activity has been enthusiastically launched. According to statistics on February 7th, the attendance rate of male and female laborers in the entire cooperative reached 84%.

    The Xingning Agricultural Cooperative was an advanced cooperative formed in the spring of 1956 by five hundred and five peasant households. The cooperative is located in the center of the Yellow River irrigation area and has good water conservancy conditions. However, due to a lack of management experience in the first year of its establishment, nearly all of the cooperative's more than 600 mu of cotton was unharvested; sixty-eight livestock died in the cooperative within a year; coupled with large investments in the cooperative and a failure to pay attention to sideline production, as well as some rain and flood disasters, the cooperative's production and income decreased last year. Therefore, after the year-end final accounting and distribution, the members were dissatisfied with the cooperative and had many opinions. Some wanted to withdraw from the cooperative; others wanted to go out on their own to engage in sideline production. The attendance rate for daily collective production in the cooperative dropped from 80% to 30% to 40%.

    The Party branch and the cooperative management committee of this cooperative were not discouraged by the reduction in production in 1956. They actively summarized the experience and lessons learned from running the cooperative with the members, and after democratic discussion by the members, they decided to implement a responsibility system of production teams contracting for cultivation and output. At the same time, it was decided to dig seven drainage ditches in the more than 2,000 mu of flood-prone low-lying land to completely control waterlogging and increase production. According to the plan, the total income from agricultural and sideline industries this year will increase by 28.75% compared to last year. The cooperative also decided that the cooperative's various investments should not exceed 35% of the total income (in the past year, the cooperative's various investments accounted for 44% of the total income) in order to increase the income of the members.

    Since November of last year, the Xingning Agricultural Cooperative has also paid attention to developing sideline production. Before the Spring Festival, the profits from the cooperative members' engagement in transportation, ironwork, woodworking, and other nine kinds of sideline industries accounted for more than 70% of the cooperative's total income from sideline production last year. In order to allow the members to have pocket money during the Spring Festival, the cooperative distributed the sideline income in a timely manner.

    The Xingning Agricultural Cooperative actively accepted past lessons and improved its management, which restored the members' confidence in doing a good job in production. From February 2nd to 7th, the members quickly completed the project of seven drainage ditches, four thousand meters long and more than six thousand cubic meters of earth. In addition, fertilizer accumulation, seed selection, and other work are also being carried out actively. The members are full of confidence in transforming the cooperative, which had reduced production last year, into a cooperative with increased production.

### 一个去年减产的农业社毫不气馁  重整旗鼓全面备耕力争增产增收

    一个去年减产的农业社毫不气馁
    重整旗鼓全面备耕力争增产增收
    本报郑州11日电　“春季生产能搞好，增产就牢靠”，河南省新乡县兴宁乡兴宁农业生产合作社的社员，提出了加紧备耕的行动口号。
    春节刚过，兴宁农业社的社员们，就脱下新衣服参加备耕活动。能干铁工活的紧张修理农具；会做木工活的忙着改修播种耧；四十二辆铁轮车装着粪送往播种棉花的地里；五十个身强力壮的小伙子正在积肥；三百六十八个男女社员在挖排涝渠。田野上还可以看到拣棉花种的和整修麦田毛渠准备春灌的一队一队的人群。繁忙的备耕活动已热烈展开。据2月7日统计，当天全社男女劳动力出勤率达到84％。
    兴宁农业社是在1956年春季由五百零五户农民组成的高级社。这个社位于引黄灌区的中心，有较好的水利条件。但是因为建社的第一年缺乏管理经验，全社六百多亩棉花几乎没有收成；一年内社里死掉牲口六十八头；加上社内投资大和没有重视副业生产，以及遭受了一些雨涝灾害，全社去年减产减收。因此，年终决算分配以后，社员对社感到不满，意见纷纷。有的要退社；有的要自己出去搞副业生产。社里每日集体生产的出勤率，由以往的80％降为30％到40％。
    这个社的党支部和社管理委员会，并没有因为1956年减产泄气。他们积极地同社员一起总结办社的经验教训，并经过社员民主讨论，决定实行生产队包耕包产的责任制度。同时决定在两千多亩易涝的低洼地里，挖七条排涝渠，彻底控制内涝，增加生产。按照计划，今年农副业总收入要比去年增加28.75％。社里还决定社的各项投资，不得超过总收入的35％（过去一年社的各项投资占总收入44％），以增加社员的收入。
    从去年11月份开始，兴宁农业社还注意开展了副业生产。到春节以前，社员搞运输、铁业、木业等九种副业的获利占全社去年全年副业生产收入的70％以上。为了使社员们在过春节的时候有零花钱，社里及时分配了副业收入。
    兴宁农业社积极接受过去的教训，改进经营管理，使社员们重新树立了搞好生产的信心。从2月2日至7日，社员们就快完成七条四千公尺长、六千多方土的排涝渠的工程。此外，积肥、选种等工作也在积极进行。社员们信心百倍地要把去年减产的社变为增产的社。
