The Development of Radar Technology
		Shang Zhixiang

Radar technology, also known as radio positioning, is a technical science that developed during World War II. Over the past dozen years, radar technology has developed at an astonishing rate, and along with it, many new scientific and technological departments have also developed, such as reconnaissance and jamming technology, radio astronomy, remote control technology, infrared direction finding technology, electronic computing technology, etc., which have given the radio electronics family a new look, greatly increased its members, and enriched its content, so that in the entire field of natural science, radio electronics has occupied an extremely important position.

Radio communication, the old partner of radio electronics, first had wired communication, followed by wireless communication. Wireless communication laid a solid foundation for electrovacuum technology, electronic circuits, and the theory of radio waves. During World War II, due to the rapid development of aviation technology, both sides of the war tried their best to study good methods of air defense. With the joint efforts of many scientists and technicians, radar was finally born. At that time, radar was the most effective air defense weapon.

Currently, the most widely used is pulse radar. Pulse radar can use an antenna with a very sharp directivity to integrate a beam of high-frequency pulse electromagnetic waves and then transmit it. After the transmitted electromagnetic wave encounters a target, a part of it is reflected back. A highly sensitive receiver can be used to amplify the reflected wave and display it on the display. The returned pulse and the transmitted pulse differ in time by the time it takes for the electromagnetic wave to travel twice the distance to the target. Therefore, as long as electronic circuit technology is used to measure this time difference, the distance to the target can be determined. The direction of the target is the direction of the directional antenna, so the position of the target is completely measured. Therefore, radar technology is a technology that uses radio waves to detect the position of a target, also known as radio positioning. It can be seen from here that radar technology is a combined application of microwave technology (only microwaves can generate beams with very sharp directivity), pulse technology, display technology, and automatic control technology (controlling the antenna and target distance). Conversely, radar technology has greatly promoted the development of these technologies.

Radar technology has put forward a series of requirements for microwave electronics. It requires high-frequency pulse oscillation with high power for long range; it requires a wide frequency range of high-frequency oscillation for anti-interference; it requires even higher oscillation frequencies in order to occupy new frequency bands. Therefore, microwave electronics is advancing by leaps and bounds. Following the high-power triode pulse oscillation tube, there appeared klystrons, magnetrons, traveling-wave tubes, backward-wave tubes, electron beam tubes, etc., with wavelengths ranging from several meters to several millimeters, and power ranging from several milliwatts to several megawatts (pulse power). Magnetrons and klystrons are the two most widely used microwave electron tubes. Magnetrons are used as transmitting oscillators, and klystrons are used as local oscillators. Traveling-wave tubes and backward-wave tubes are the latest microwave electron tubes. Small-power traveling-wave tubes have the ability to amplify, and their noise has been reduced. They have been adopted in newly produced radar sets. High-power traveling-wave tubes or backward-wave tubes are superior to magnetrons because of their wide frequency range. Due to the manufacture and research of the above-mentioned microwave electron tubes, the theory of electron motion and the theory of electromagnetic fields have been developed under the verification of practice.

Radar technology has put forward a series of requirements for microwave technology. It requires antennas with high gain, light weight, fast scanning, and the ability to generate beams of a certain shape; it requires transmission lines with small losses, wide bandwidth, and the ability to withstand large pulse power; it requires small losses in space propagation and the ability to grasp the impact of ground reflection; it requires finding a special material that can absorb microwave energy while reflecting very little. As a result, various types of antennas have appeared, including parabolic reflector antennas, horn antennas, waveguide antennas, lens antennas, dielectric antennas, and helical antennas. The sharpest antenna beam has reached 0.5 degrees. In terms of transmission lines, in addition to coaxial lines, the invention of waveguides has great significance. Waveguides are good transmission lines for microwaves, and their development prospects are still very large, with a trend of being used for long-distance transmission of microwave energy. Recently, people have studied new waveguides—strip waveguides and microstrip waveguides, which have pointed out new directions for the development of waveguides. In terms of theory, the theory of electromagnetic wave transmission in conductors, the theory of cavity resonators, the theory of antenna radiation, and the theory of electromagnetic wave propagation of different wavelengths in the atmosphere and ionosphere have all undergone new developments. In addition, more and more attention is being paid to the transmission characteristics of electromagnetic waves in magnetic materials. Research in this area has provided new avenues for radar technology. For example, a magnetic material called ferrite, under specific operating conditions, only allows electromagnetic waves to be transmitted in one direction, reducing its transmission in the opposite direction. Using it as a frequency-stabilizing component to replace the currently used frequency automatic control circuits, which are not very stable and are quite complex, has great prospects.

Radar technology has also put forward a series of requirements for pulse technology. That is, high-voltage pulse technology, precise discharge switch tubes, fast electronic sweep circuits, various scaling wave technologies, and so on. In order to make distance measurement more accurate and improve the resolution of radar, pulse technology has advanced from microsecond technology to nanosecond technology. Nanosecond technology plus millimeter-wave technology may give radar a new look—what is seen on the radar display is no longer a representative pulse wave, but a rough outline of the target can be observed, that is, it is close to television, which can make measurement more accurate.

The tasks put forward by radar technology to display technology are: to manufacture long-persistence cathode ray tubes and to study various display methods. The manufacture of cathode ray tubes has further developed electron optics, and there are already no less than dozens of types of displays. Currently, there is a new type of cathode ray tube that can retain images for a long time without disappearing, called a storage tube; there is also a strange cathode ray tube that displays not images but numbers or text, which can be used for marking and is called a digital tube. New radar displays also include three-dimensional, colored, comprehensive magnified, and only display moving targets. In short, its development surface is also exceptionally broad.

The tasks put forward by radar technology to automatic control technology are: to be able to flexibly control fairly large antennas with very little force, and to be very fast, very accurate, and very stable. Radar used for artillery aiming requires the antenna to automatically track the target in direction, and the ranging aiming line to automatically track the target in distance. In this way, without human operation, the coordinates of the target can be automatically and continuously recorded, so the theory and technology of automatic control are also very important in radar.

Radar, like other radio equipment, requires reducing volume, reducing weight, and increasing robustness, so semiconductors and printed circuits have broad prospects in radar technology. Currently, it seems that the timing circuits, audio sections, and intermediate frequency sections in radar can be completely replaced by crystal triodes or multi-pole tubes; some rectifier tubes can be replaced by high-power crystal diodes; the further development of solar cells also makes it possible to use them as radar power sources. A small microwave radar receiver that has been designed, which is only the size of a steel helmet, is a good example.

The rapid development of the above-mentioned technologies has made radar technology increasingly perfect. The maximum range of radar is no longer limited by the radar itself, but by the curvature of the earth. If the radar is erected very high, such as on an aircraft 10,000 meters high, then it is possible to observe ground targets 400 kilometers away and aircraft at the same height 800 kilometers away. The accuracy of radar is also very high. The representative distance error is only 10 to 20 meters, and the angular error is only about 0.1 degrees. There are also countless types of radar sets, such as weather radar, navigation radar, and geodetic radar on aircraft; navigation radar on ships; landing command radar at airports; weather radar at meteorological stations, and so on. Radar is even more widely used in military applications. Surveillance radar constantly monitors the airspace day and night, not allowing enemy aircraft to have the slightest gap to sneak in; command radar can correctly guide our aircraft to attack enemy aircraft in a favorable position and can also be used to identify friend or foe; artillery aiming radar can automatically track enemy aircraft or enemy ships to achieve accurate hits; searchlight radar can first find the enemy aircraft and then turn on the lights, avoiding exposing the target when it is not illuminated; aircraft also have blind bombing radar and tail warning radar; on the ground there are also radar for observing tanks, cars, and measuring mortar positions, as well as radar for controlling missiles, and so on.

New scientific and technological departments have grown up on the basis of the development of radar technology. Reconnaissance, jamming, and anti-jamming technologies have developed rapidly, because the fatal weakness of radar is being jammed. Therefore, we must try our best to jam the enemy's radar to make it ineffective, and at the same time strive to prevent the enemy's jamming so that our own radar can still work normally. Therefore, the tactical and technical struggle between radar and jamming, and jamming and anti-jamming has developed very sharply and is also very important. During World War II, after two German warships were surrounded by the British, they relied on releasing jamming to confuse the British radar to escape in the fog. At present, reconnaissance technology has been greatly developed, and high-power clutter jamming technology can also be achieved, but anti-jamming technology has not been completely perfected. In order to solve this problem, comprehensively studying the nature of jamming, the information capacity, and anti-jamming methods has become a focus of research.

On the basis of radar technology, a new discipline—radio astronomy—was born. It is a science that uses radar to observe constellations in the universe. People know that the earth is surrounded by the atmosphere and ionosphere. In addition to visible light, ultraviolet rays, and infrared rays being able to penetrate this surrounding layer to observe the secrets of the universe, electromagnetic waves with wavelengths ranging from 20 meters to several millimeters can also penetrate. At the same time, many constellations constantly radiate this electromagnetic wave, so radar-like equipment can be used to receive it, determine its existence, and thereby study it. The antenna of this radar is very large, with some reaching more than 100 meters in diameter, so the beam is exceptionally sharp, and it is also called a radio telescope. Using radar to observe the echo of the moon was realized during World War II. Using radar to observe high-altitude weather provides a new method for meteorological research, and has further formed the new discipline of radio meteorology.

Accompanying the development of radar technology, remote control has been rapidly developed. The content of remote control is very rich. Generally speaking, it can be divided into two categories: open-loop control and closed-loop automatic control. Compared with antenna control in radar, the control circuit of the former is more complex, with high frequency, low frequency, and various calculation devices and control devices. At present, the most complex remote control is missile control. The control of many missiles relies on radar technology. Therefore, it can be said that without radar technology, there would be no missiles. The theory of automatic control has now developed into an independent science, and its future is even more unlimited.

Inspired by radar technology, infrared direction finding technology has also been greatly developed. In the ocean, infrared direction finding equipment can be used to find the position of warships; if a missile is equipped with infrared automatic direction finding equipment, it can automatically find the target and accurately hit the target.

Radar and television can be said to be brothers. Radar's pulse technology, microwave technology, and display technology are all related to the development of television technology. Of course, radar technology also has common ground with the new field of radio communication, which is microwave multi-channel communication. The application of microwave technology in communication has greatly expanded the communication capacity, and each microwave channel can communicate with hundreds of pairs at the same time. The application of pulse technology in communication is also very successful. Pulse code modulation has been proven to be the best modulation method, with low noise coefficient and good anti-interference performance.

Pulse technology has also promoted the rapid development of electronic computing technology; microwave technology has promoted the development of microwave spectroscopy and microwave electron accelerators. These are also closely related to the development of radar technology.

The rapid development of new fields in radio electronics has also greatly promoted the new development of radar technology. The latest radar system is no longer a series of independently working radar sets, but organically connects various radars, reconnaissance jammers, electronic computers, microwave relay stations, remote control, television, etc. into a radar network. This kind of radar network is no longer just a defensive reconnaissance tool, but a powerful offensive weapon. The military application of radar is always at the forefront. The future working situation of the radar network will be like this: closely arranged radar stations are deployed on our territory and in our airspace. Its intelligence can be quickly transmitted to the command center using microwave relay stations or television methods; there, huge electronic computers immediately select, analyze, and identify various intelligence, and then display all the intelligence on a huge display screen. The commander can then issue orders based on the intelligence, and the orders are also transformed into control signals by the electronic computer, quickly manipulating a certain weapon in a certain area to automatically attack. Similarly, in peaceful applications, the radar network will provide the greatest safety for the navigation of aircraft and ships, and will allow people to quickly grasp climate changes. Only with the increasing perfection of the radar network can interstellar flight be guaranteed. Therefore, the rapid development of radar technology has extremely important significance for other new scientific departments, for the national economy, and for national defense. Radar technology itself and the various scientific departments associated with radar technology, from theory to practice, are so rich in content and so important in their position, so we must quickly master it, study it, and strive to approach the advanced world scientific level.

    雷达技术的发展	尚志祥
    雷达技术又称无线电定位术，是第二次世界大战期间发展起来的一门技术科学。十几年来，雷达技术以惊人的速度发展着，和它同时，许多新的科学技术部门也发展起来，比如侦察和干扰技术、射电天文学、远距离操纵技术、红外线测向技术、电子计算技术等，使无线电电子学这个大家庭的面貌为之一新，成员大大增多，内容异常丰富，以致在整个自然科学领域中，无线电电子学已经居于极其重要的地位。
    无线电电子学的老伙伴通信，它先是有线通信，随后是无线通信。无线电通信为电真空技术、电子线路和无线电波的理论打下了坚实的基础。第二次世界大战期间，由于航空技术的迅速发展，作战双方都极力研究防空的良好办法，在许多科学技术人员的共同努力下，雷达终于问世了。那时候的雷达，是一种最有效果的防空武器。
    目前应用最多的是脉冲雷达。脉冲雷达能把高频脉冲电磁波用方向性很尖锐的天线集成一束，然后发射出去。这发射的电磁波遇到目标以后有一部分反射回来，利用灵敏度很高的接收机就可以把反射波放大，并在显示器上显示出来。回来的脉冲和发射的脉冲在时间上相差电磁波行走两倍目标距离所需要的时间，因此，只要利用电子线路的技术测量出这时间差，目标的距离也就确定了，而目标的方向就是定向天线的方向，这样目标的位置就完全被测量出来了；所以雷达技术就是利用无线电波来探测目标位置的一种技术，又称为无线电定位术。从这里可以看出，雷达技术就是微波技术（只有微波才能产生方向性很尖锐的波束）、脉冲技术、显示技术以及自动控制技术（控制天线和目标距离）的合同应用，反过来雷达技术又大大地促进了这些技术的发展。
    雷达技术向微波电子学提出了一系列的要求。它要求高频脉冲振荡功率大，可以看得远；要求高频振荡的频率范围宽，利于反干扰；要求振荡的频率更高，以便占领新波段。因此微波电子学大踏步地进展着，继大功率的三极管脉冲振荡管之后，出现了塔形管、磁控管、调速管、行波管、返波管、电子注管，等等，波长从几米到几毫米，功率从几毫瓦到几兆瓦（脉冲功率）。磁控管和调速管是目前用得最多的两种微波电子管，磁控管用作发射振荡器，调速管用作本地振荡器。行波管和返波管是最新的微波电子管，小功率的行波管由于它有放大的本领，噪音等已经降低，目前已经被采用于新生产的雷达机中。大功率行波管或返波管由于它的频率范围宽，比磁控管优越。由于上述微波电子管的制造和研究，电子运动的理论以及电磁场的理论在实践的验证下都有了发展。
    雷达技术向微波技术提出了一系列的要求。它要求天线增益高、体积轻、扫瞄快并且能产生一定形状的波束；要求传输线损耗小、波带宽、又能耐大的脉冲功率；要求空间传播的损耗小，并且能掌握地面反射所产生的影响；要求寻找某一种特殊的材料，能够吸收微波能量而反射则极少。于是出现了形形色色的天线，有抛物体反射面天线、喇叭天线、波导天线、透镜天线、介质天线以及螺旋形天线等，最尖锐的天线波柱已经可以达到零点五度。输送线方面除了同轴线以外，波导的发明具有重大的意义，波导是微波的良好传输线，它的发展前途还很大，有被利用来作为长距离传输微波能量的趋势。最近有人研究了新的波导——带状波导和条状波导，为波导的发展指出了新的方向。在理论方面，电磁波在导体中的传输理论、空腔谐振器理论、天线辐射理论、不同波长的电磁波在大气中以及电离层中的传播理论，都有了新的发展。此外，愈来愈令人注意的是电磁波在磁性材料中的传输特性，这一方面的研究已经为雷达技术提供了新的途径。譬如有一种名叫铁淦氧的磁性材料，在特定的工作条件下，只允许电磁波向一个方向传输，减缩它反方向的传输，利用它作为稳定频率的元件，代替目前所使用的性能不很稳定的而又是相当复杂的频率自动控制线路是有很大前途的。
    雷达技术向脉冲技术也提出了一系列的要求。那就是高压脉冲技术、精确的放电开关管、快速的电子扫掠电路、各种刻度波的技术，等等。为了使测量距离更精确并提高雷达的分辨能力，脉冲技术已经从微秒技术推进到毫微秒技术。毫微秒技术加上毫米波技术，就有可能使雷达出现新的面貌——从雷达显示器上看到的不再是代表性的脉冲波，而是能够观察出目标的粗略轮廓，也就是说，接近于电视了，这就可以使测量更为精确。
    雷达技术向显示技术提出的课题是：制造长余辉的阴极射线管、研究各种显示方法。阴极射线管的制造进一步发展了电子光学，各种型式的显示器已经不下几十种。目前又有一种新的阴极射线管，它能在很长时间内保留画像不消失，叫作储能管，也叫蓄像管；还有一种奇异的阴极射线管，它显示出来的不是图像而是数字或文字，可以利用它作标记用，称为数字管。新的雷达显示器也有立体的、有色的、综合扩大的、只显示活动目标的。总之它的发展面也异常广阔。
    雷达技术向自动控制技术提出的课题是：能用很小的力量灵活地控制相当庞大的天线，而且很迅速、很精确、很稳定。供炮火瞄准用的雷达，要求天线能够自动地在方向上跟踪目标，要求测距准线能够自动地在距离上追踪目标；这样，不用人的操纵，目标的座标就能够自动地连续不断地记录下来，因此自动控制的理论和技术在雷达中也是非常重要的。
    雷达也同其他无线电设备一样，要求减小体积、减轻重量、增加坚固性，因此半导体和印刷线路在雷达技术中有着广阔的前途。目前看来，雷达中的定时线路、影频部分和中频部分中的电子管完全可以用晶体三极管或多极管来代替；一部分整流管可以用大功率晶体二极管来代替；日光电池的进一步发展，也有可能用作雷达的电源；已经设计出的一种小型微波雷达接收机，只有钢盔那样大，就是很好的例子。
    上述各种技术的迅速发展，使得雷达技术愈来愈完善，雷达的最大作用距离已经不受雷达本身的限制，而是受地球曲率的限制。如果雷达机架设得很高，譬如在一万公尺高的飞机上，那末观察四百公里远的地面目标和观察八百公里远同样高度的飞机是能够做到的。雷达的精确度也是很高了，代表性的距离误差只是十到二十公尺，角度误差只是零点一度左右。雷达机的种类也已经不胜枚举，如飞机上的测暴风雨雷达、导航雷达、大地测量雷达，船舰上的导航雷达，飞机场的降落指挥雷达，气象站的测气候雷达，等等。雷达在军事上的用途更是广泛。警戒雷达日夜不断地监视着领空，不让敌机有丝毫的空隙可以偷袭进来；指挥雷达能够正确地引导我机以有利的地位攻击敌机，还能用于鉴别敌我；炮火瞄准雷达能够自动地跟踪敌机或敌舰，以达到精确的命中；探照灯雷达能够先把敌机找到以后再开灯，避免没有照中时暴露目标；飞机上还有盲目轰炸雷达、机尾警戒雷达；地面上还有观察坦克、汽车和测量迫击炮位的雷达以及控制导弹的雷达，等等。
    在雷达技术的发展基础上，新的科学技术部门生长出来了。侦察、干扰和反干扰技术就有了迅速的发展，因为雷达的致命弱点是被干扰。因此要极力想法干扰敌人的雷达使它失去效用，同时又要力求防止敌人的干扰使自己的雷达仍能正常工作，于是雷达和干扰、干扰和反干扰之间的战术上以及技术上的斗争发展得非常尖锐，同时又非常重要。第二次世界大战中德国有两艘军舰被英国包围以后，就是靠施放干扰迷惑英国的雷达才得在大雾中逃脱的。目前侦察技术已经很发展了，强功率的杂波干扰技术也已经可以做到，而反干扰技术还没有彻底完善地解决。为了解决这一问题，全面地研究干扰的性质、信息的容量以及反干扰的方法等，成为集中研究的问题。
    在雷达技术的基础上，新的学科——射电天文学诞生了。它是利用雷达来观察宇宙间星座的一门科学。人们知道地球是被大气层及电离层包围住的，除了可见光、紫外线、红外线能够透过这个包围层观察宇宙的秘密以外，波长从二十公尺到几毫米的电磁波也能透过，同时恰恰有许多星座经常不断地在辐射这种电磁波，因此就可以利用类似雷达的设备去接收它，确定它的存在，从而研究它。这种雷达的天线非常大，直径有的达一百多公尺，因而波柱异常尖锐，又称无线电望远镜。用雷达观察月亮的回波在第二次世界大战期间已经实现了。用雷达观察高空气象，为气象学的研究提供了一个新方法，进而形成了无线电气象技术这个新的学科。
    伴随雷达技术的发展，远距离操纵得到了迅速的发展。远距离操纵的内容十分丰富，总的来说可以分为开路操纵和闭路自动控制两大类，这同雷达中的天线控制相比，前者的控制回路更为复杂，有高频、有低频，也有各种计算装置和控制装置。目前远距离操纵最复杂的要算是导弹控制了，许多导弹的控制就是借助于雷达技术的，因此可以这样说，没有雷达技术，就不可能有导弹。自动控制的理论，目前已经发展成为一门独立的科学，它的前途更是无可限量的。
    由于雷达技术的启发，红外线测向技术也有了很大的发展。在海洋里，可以利用红外线测向设备寻找军舰的位置；导弹头上如果装有红外线自动测向设备，就能够自动地寻找目标并且精确地命中目标。
    雷达和电视，可以说是一兄一弟。雷达的脉冲技术、微波技术、显示技术都是同电视技术的发展有关联的。当然雷达技术也和无线电通信的新领域有共同的地方，那就是微波多路通信。微波技术在通信中的应用使得通信容量大大扩展，每一路微波波道可以同时通几百对之多。脉冲技术在通信中的应用也是非常成功的，脉码调制已经被证明是最良好的调制方法，它的噪音系数小，抗干扰性能好。
    脉冲技术还推动了电子计算技术的迅速发展；微波技术推动了微波光谱学和微波电子加速器的发展。这些也都同雷达技术的发展有着紧密的关系。
    无线电电子学新领域的迅速发展，同时也大大推动了雷达技术的新发展。最新的雷达体系已经不再是一部部独立工作的雷达机了，而是把各种雷达、侦察干扰机、电子计算机、微波接力站、远距离操纵、电视等有机地联系起来成为一个雷达网，这样的雷达网不再只是防御性质的侦察工具了，而是进攻的有力武器。雷达的军事应用始终是跑在最前头的，未来雷达网的工作情况将是这样：在我们的领土上和领空上布置严密的雷达站，它的情报可以应用微波接力站或电视的办法迅速地传送到指挥中心去；在那里，巨大的电子计算机立刻把各种情报进行选择、分析和鉴别，然后把全部情报显映在一个巨大的显示屏上，指挥员就可以根据情报发布命令，命令也是通过电子计算机变为一种操纵讯号，迅速地操纵某一地区的某一武器自动出击。同样，在和平应用上，雷达网将使飞机和船舶的航行得到最大的安全，将使气候的变化迅速地被人们所掌握，也只有借助于雷达网的日益完善，星际飞行才会有保障。因此雷达技术的迅速发展，对其他新的科学部门、对国民经济以及对国防事业都有极其重要的意义。雷达技术本身以及同雷达技术相关联的各个科学部门，从理论到实践，它的内容是这样的丰富，它的地位是这样的重要，因此我们必须迅速地掌握它、研究它，为接近先进的世界科学水平而努力。
