Following on-the-spot investigations by geological personnel, it has been confirmed that the Qilian Mountains are rich in mineral resources.
Within the area stretching over 800 kilometers from east to west, there are intermittently distributed deposits of copper, iron, coal, lead-zinc, chromite, gold, platinum, and other minerals.

Xinhua News Agency report: Yan Jinan, a geological engineer who recently returned to Beijing from the Qilian Mountains, stated at a recent geological academic conference: "The Qilian Mountains are very rich in mineral resources, and there are certain clues for finding various minerals." Geological engineers Yan Jinan and Lu Zhenxing have been conducting prospecting work in the Qilian Mountains since 1951. Based on the data from their on-the-spot surveys over the past few years, it has been confirmed that copper and iron ore are intermittently distributed within the 850-kilometer-long area from east to west in the Qilian Mountains. Large coalfields, lead-zinc deposits, and chromite deposits are distributed on the south and north sides of the Qilian Mountains. In the central region, in addition to chromite, there are also rare metals such as gold and platinum, as well as other metallic and non-metallic mineral resources.

The Qilian Mountains, known as the Urals of China, are over 1,200 kilometers long and distributed between Gansu and Qinghai provinces. They are one of China's most promising mineral areas. To the northwest and northeast is the Hexi Corridor area, with rising green mountains in the north and the low-lying Qaidam Basin to the southwest. Most of the Qilian Mountains area is located at high altitude. Seven years ago, the Ministry of Geology organized the Qilian Mountains Comprehensive Exploration Team. Yan Jinan, Lu Zhenxing, and over two hundred other geological workers conducted prospecting on the south and north sides of the Qilian Mountains, traversing many areas that were still blank on geological maps. It is expected that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, they will create a tectonic map of the Qilian Mountains.

In 1956, the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences designated the Qilian Mountains as one of its key areas of work. It dispatched geological experts in mineralogy, petrology, ore deposits, and tectonics, including Wang Hongzhen, Zhang Wenyou, Yang Jie, Li Pu, and Tu Guangchi, to conduct field research. They traversed the Qilian Mountains along eleven routes, gaining a general understanding of the geological structure, stratigraphic distribution, geological development history, and metallogenic patterns of the Qilian Mountains.

    经过地质人员实地勘察
    证实祁连山矿藏丰富
    这里从东到西八百多公里地带内，断续地有铜、铁、煤、铅锌、铬铁、黄金、白金以及其它矿产
    据新华社讯　刚从祁连山回到北京的地质工程师严济南，在最近举行的一次地质学术报告会上提出：“祁连山的矿藏很丰富，各种矿都有一定线索寻找”。地质工程师严济南、卢振兴从1951年就在祁连山进行普查找矿工作，根据他们这几年实地勘察的资料证实：在祁连山从东到西的八百五十多公里的地带内断续地有铜、铁矿分布。大煤田、铅锌矿和铬铁矿分布在祁连山的南、北两侧。在中部除铬铁矿外，还有黄金、白金等稀有金属以及其它金属和非金属矿产。
    被誉为中国乌拉尔的祁连山，全长一千二百多公里，分布在甘肃和青海之间，是我国最有希望的矿产地之一。西北和东北方是河西走廊地带，北部青山突起，西南方则为低凹的柴达木盆地。祁连山的大部地带属于高空区域。七年前由地质部组织了祁连山综合考察大队，严济南、卢振兴和其它二百多个地质工作者，就在祁连山南、北两侧进行普查找矿，他们走过了许多在地质图上还是空白的地区。预计在第二个五年计划期间内，他们将绘制出祁连山的大地构造图。
    中国科学院地质研究所在1956年将祁连山作为工作重点之一，派出了包括矿物、岩石、矿床、大地构造等方面的地质专家王鸿祯、张文佑、杨杰、李璞、涂光炽等，进行野外研究。他们在祁连山横穿了十一条路线，对祁连山的地质构造和地层分布、地质发展历史及成矿规律获得概括的了解。
