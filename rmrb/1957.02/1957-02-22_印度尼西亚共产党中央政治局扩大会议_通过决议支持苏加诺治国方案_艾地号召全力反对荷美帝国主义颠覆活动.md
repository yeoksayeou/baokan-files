Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 21st - The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, at an enlarged meeting held on the 20th, passed a resolution expressing its agreement with President Sukarno's state policy concept and calling on the Indonesian people to fully support and strive to implement this concept.

The "Resolution of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia on the President's Concept," published today in Jakarta's "People's Daily," stated that the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia believes that the Western democratic system implemented in Indonesia has brought losses to the development of the Indonesian revolution and democratic activities. Furthermore, generally speaking, this political system, like in Western countries, cannot solve the main problems of society. In Indonesia, this system has been used by foreign imperialists and their running dogs at home to undermine national unity and the integrity of the republic. They engage in provocation among the various ethnic groups, parties, religions, armies, between the local and central governments, and between state tools and the people in Indonesia. They launched a coup in Sumatra under the banner of "implementing democracy" and "implementing local autonomy."

The resolution, after clarifying that the Communist Party of Indonesia currently does not intend to depart from the parliamentary democratic system to seek a people's democratic system or other new types of democratic systems, stated that some people are currently attempting to implement a fascist system in the form of "military committees," "Wild Bull Division committees," and "Eagle Revolutionary Committees." Therefore, the most important task of the Indonesian people's revolutionary movement is to safeguard the parliamentary democratic system and strive to reduce the excessive liberalism of the parliamentary democratic system, making it less susceptible to being used by counter-revolutionaries to harm the movement to safeguard democracy and national independence.

The resolution stated that the President's Concept is a critique of the excessive liberalism of the Western democratic system or the parliamentary democratic system. The President's Concept is not a people's democratic concept but, as the President himself calls it, "guided democracy" or "mutual assistance democracy." This concept is an answer to the serious political problems currently facing the Indonesian people.

The resolution stated that if the President's Concept can be realized, the anti-colonialist national unity will be broader and more consolidated. The President's Concept hopes to establish a National Council that will give instructions to the cabinet to maintain the general line of the national struggle and avoid stagnation or slow implementation of progressive policies. Therefore, the establishment of the National Council brings new weapons to the Indonesian people in the struggle to realize the demands of the 1945 Revolution.

The resolution stated that the cabinet to be established according to the President's Concept is based on the proportion of seats held in the parliament, which is actually a further development of the system of administrative committees of local governments that has already been implemented. This system is obviously capable of uniting and mobilizing the greatest national strength, therefore, it is a system of which the Indonesian people are proud.

The resolution concluded by saying that the imperialists and their running dogs are and will continue to undermine the implementation of the President's Concept so that their plans can proceed smoothly. Due to this fact, the people should be vigilant and strive to implement the President's Concept. The Communist Party of Indonesia calls on all Indonesian people, regardless of gender or age, to hold meetings of all sizes in cities, villages, factories, and schools to discuss the President's Concept.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 21st - According to Jakarta's "People's Daily" on the 19th, Jacques Kahn, a reporter for the French "L'Humanité," recently visited Aidit, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indonesia. In response to questions raised by Kahn, Aidit said that at the present stage, the Communist Party of Indonesia strives for the Indonesian government to be able to implement a program of opposing colonialism, defending world peace, and democracy, and is willing to participate in taking responsibility for general affairs by participating in such a central government, that is, if the government's program is agreed to by us and its composition is able to guarantee the implementation of this program. In the present stage of the revolution, the greater goal of the Communist Party of Indonesia is to organize a people's government capable of guaranteeing the elimination of imperialist and feudal forces in Indonesia.

Aidit pointed out that the number one enemy of the Indonesian people at present is the Dutch colonialists who have the largest investment in Indonesia and continue to carry out colonial rule over West Irian, Indonesian territory.

Aidit said that the American imperialists are also dangerous enemies. On the one hand, the American imperialists collude with the Dutch colonialists to maintain the imperialists' interests in Indonesia, and on the other hand, they use the contradictions and opposition between the Indonesian people and the Netherlands to attempt to seize the economic position of the Netherlands in Indonesia and win over Indonesia to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc.

He pointed out that these vicious activities of American imperialism were very obvious at the end of last year, namely, the already failed Lubis coup conspiracy and the rebellions of Simbolon and Hussein.

Aidit said that therefore, in addition to having to deal with the intervention of the Dutch imperialists, the Indonesian people must never allow the intervention of other imperialists, especially the American imperialists. The Indonesian people do not want to "drive away the tiger from the front door and let the wolf in through the back door." They will continue to concentrate all their efforts on dealing with the Dutch colonialists or the American imperialists, or the union of the two.

### 印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局扩大会议  通过决议支持苏加诺治国方案  艾地号召全力反对荷美帝国主义颠覆活动

    印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局扩大会议
    通过决议支持苏加诺治国方案
    艾地号召全力反对荷美帝国主义颠覆活动
    新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局在20日举行的扩大会议上通过决议，表示同意苏加诺总统的治国方案，并且号召印度尼西亚人民全力支持和努力实现这个方案。
    今天在雅加达“人民日报”发表的这项“印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局关于总统方案的决议”说，印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局认为，印度尼西亚实行的西方民主制度对印度尼西亚革命和民主活动的发展带来了损失。此外，一般地说，这种政治制度也像在西方国家一样，不能解决社会的主要问题。在印度尼西亚，这种制度被外国帝国主义者及其在国内的走狗利用来破坏民族团结和共和国的完整。他们在印度尼西亚的各民族、党派、宗教、军队之间，在地方与中央之间，以及在国家工具与人民之间进行挑拨。他们以“实行民主”和“实行地方自治”的招牌在苏门答腊发动政变。
    决议在说明印度尼西亚共产党目前并没有离开议会民主制度以寻求人民民主制度或其他新型的民主制度的意思以后说，目前有些人企图以“军事委员会”、“雄牛师委员会”、“鹰革命委员会”等形式来实行法西斯制度，因此，印度尼西亚人民革命运动的最重要的任务是维护议会民主制度以及努力减少议会民主制度的过分自由主义性质，使这个议会民主制度不容易被反革命分子利用来损害维护民主和民族独立的运动。
    决议说，总统方案是对西方民主制度或议会民主制度的过分自由主义性质的批判。总统的方案不是人民民主的方案而是如总统自称的“有领导的民主”或“互助民主”。这个方案是对目前印度尼西亚人民所面对的严重政治问题的答案。
    决议说，如果总统方案能够实现，反殖民主义的民族团结将更加广泛和更加巩固。总统方案中希望成立一个全国委员会，这个委员会将给内阁作指示，以维持民族斗争的总路线，以避免进步政策的停顿或缓慢实行。因此，全国委员会的成立为印度尼西亚人民在实现1945年革命的要求的斗争中带来了新的武器。
    决议说，根据总统的方案所要成立的内阁，是以国会中占有席位的比率作为基础，这实际上是已经实行的地方政府行政委员会制度的进一步的发展。这制度显然是能团结及动员最大的民族力量，因此，这是印度尼西亚人民值得引为骄傲的制度。
    决议最后说，帝国主义者及其走狗正在并且将会继续破坏总统方案的实现，使他们的计划能够顺利进行。由于这个事实，人民应该提高警惕和努力实施总统方案。印度尼西亚共产党号召全印度尼西亚人民，不分男女老少，在城市、乡村、工厂和学校举行大小会议，讨论总统方案。
    据新华社雅加达21日电　据雅加达“人民日报”19日报道，法国“人道报”记者雅克·卡恩最近访问了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地。在回答卡恩所提的问题时，艾地说，在现阶段中，印度尼西亚共产党争取印度尼西亚政府能够执行反对殖民主义、保卫世界和平和民主的纲领，并愿意通过参加这样的中央政府来参与负责一般事务，就是这个政府的纲领是为我们所同意的，而它的组成是能够保证执行这个纲领的。在革命的现阶段中，印度尼西亚共产党更远大的目标就是组织一个有能力保证消灭在印度尼西亚的帝国主义和封建主义势力的人民政府。
    艾地指出，印度尼西亚人民目前的第一号敌人是在印度尼西亚投资最大的和继续对印度尼西亚的领土西伊里安实行殖民统治的荷兰殖民主义者。
    艾地说，美帝国主义者也是危险的敌人。美帝国主义者一方面同荷兰殖民主义者勾结起来，维护帝国主义者在印度尼西亚的利益，另一方面又利用印度尼西亚人民同荷兰的矛盾和对立，企图夺取荷兰在印度尼西亚的经济地位，并且拉拢印度尼西亚加入东南亚公约军事集团。
    他指出，美帝国主义这些恶毒活动在去年年底表现得非常明显，那就是已经失败的卢比斯政变阴谋、西姆波朗和侯赛尼的叛乱。
    艾地说，因此，印度尼西亚人民除了必须对付荷兰帝国主义者的干预以外，也决不能听任其他帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者的干预。印度尼西亚人民不愿“前门赶虎，后门进狼”，他们将继续集中全力对付荷兰殖民主义者或者美帝国主义者，或者他们两者的联合。（附图片）
