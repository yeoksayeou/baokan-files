A Down-to-Earth Work Team Focused Solely on "Nutrition"	Bīn Bīn
On November 16, 1956, the first group of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's down-to-earth work team in the Jiujiang Special District, a group of ten people led by Wang Dou, the head of the provincial confidential communications bureau, and Sun Ruguang, the head of the document receiving and dispatching section of the provincial party committee's general office, arrived at the Shimen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiujiang County. On the same day, after the group meeting discussed the work, the focus shifted to discussing eating and sleeping. Of course, the eating and sleeping arrangements for ten people should be properly resolved, but the way they went about it was completely different from that of ordinary work teams. They did not eat, live, and work with the cooperative members, but instead concentrated their stay in the agricultural cooperative's office. Their task this time was not just to focus on improving the natural village where the agricultural cooperative's office was located, but to help improve this large cooperative with sixteen production teams and six hundred and eleven households. Taking their key focus, the eleventh production team, for example, it was more than six miles of mountain road away from their "temporary residence." They also pooled their resources for meals, hiring a female cooperative member to boil water and cook for them, with a monthly salary of fourteen yuan. At the same time, they selected a group member to manage the meals. This group member, surnamed Gu, was nicknamed the "Diet Consultant."

On the second day of work, Director Wang made a special trip to Shahe Street, which was three miles away from their residence, to buy apples, white sugar, and cakes. As he was enjoying them, Group Leader Sun asked, "Director Wang, where did you buy these things?" Director Wang replied with a smile, "Eat! Get some nutrition." Under the influence of Director Wang's style, the meals became better and better.

The work team stayed in the Shimen Cooperative for more than twenty days. The types of dishes they ate included no less than six kinds of meat dishes alone, such as chicken, beef, eggs, fresh fish, rabbit meat, and pheasant. In addition to ordinary vegetables, the vegetarian dishes included no less than five kinds, such as mushrooms, fungus, daylily, vermicelli, and pickled mustard tuber. In order to make their meals more palatable, they also bought sesame paste. They also sent people to travel several miles to buy fried dough sticks, soy milk, and white sugar. Director Wang and four other comrades, including Huang and Wang, had to eat breakfast every day – eggs whisked with white sugar. This work team ate no less than five hundred eggs. As egg consumption increased, the "Diet Consultant" was busy running around, buying eggs from door to door. Precisely because of his "initiative," his name became well-known. Farmers in the surrounding villages knew that the provincial party committee's work team wanted to buy eggs. They were not satisfied with eating these eggs, they also wanted to eat chicken, and three at a time, one bowl per person.

If you want to ask whether their work was in-depth? I will cite the following few things, and people will know the answer.

Their division of labor was like this: Group Leader Wang and Group Leader Sun were dedicated to staying in the cooperative to grasp the overall situation. What exactly did they grasp? According to reports, they mainly took a few numbers from the cooperative's accounting office. The group members said they were: "Newspaper-reading group leaders."

What about the work of the other group members?

Once, the deputy group leader convened a group meeting to discuss investigating democratic management issues and decided that all group members should go down to investigate. A group member surnamed Huang did not give any reason and openly did not go to the team all day. The "Diet Consultant" pulled up the quilt and went to sleep after the meeting. A Comrade Wang shaved his beard for a long time, went out for a walk, and came back. The deputy group leader asked him what he had learned, and he replied very simply: "Couldn't find anyone!"

The four comrades responsible for the eleventh production team had to eat breakfast at the cooperative as usual every day. After breakfast, they read the newspapers, sometimes discussed the work, and after ten o'clock or even twelve o'clock in the morning, they slowly got up to go to the production team. Before four o'clock in the afternoon, they had to run more than six miles of mountain road back to eat dinner. After dinner, they rested for a while and then went to attend meetings. As for individual visits and field activities, they were not very accustomed to them.

On December 11th of last year, this group's work in the Shimen Cooperative came to an end. In more than twenty days, in addition to helping the agricultural cooperative with the distribution work, they also compiled a four or five thousand-word investigation report. What was written in the report, let's not discuss it for now. I will only focus on raising a most basic percentage of increased production recorded in the report: The Shimen Cooperative increased production by 13% this year. What was the actual situation? The Shimen Cooperative increased production by 39% this year. It was not until the two deputy group leaders brought the materials to Jiujiang and submitted them to the large group's comrades for joint study at the foreign affairs office that this problem was discovered. Deputy Group Leader Li began to panic a little and proposed to return to the cooperative to redo it, but it was too late, and the group members had already returned to the province by train.

### 一个专讲“营养”的下乡工作组

    一个专讲“营养”的下乡工作组	滨彬
    1956年11月16日的一天，江西省委下乡工作组九江专区第一小组一行十人，在大组长省机要局长王斗、小组长省委办公厅文书收发科科长孙汝光的率领下，到达了九江县石门农业生产合作社。当天小组会上研究工作以后，中心就转入讨论吃饭和睡觉的问题。十口人吃饭、睡觉当然是一个应该妥善解决的问题，但是他们所采取的方式却和一般的工作组完全不同，他们不是和社员们同吃同住同劳动，而是集中住在农业社办公室里。他们这次下乡的任务不只是集中搞好农业社办公室所在的一个自然村，而是要帮助搞好这个有十六个生产队、六百一十一户的大社。就拿他们确定的重点之一第十一生产队来说，离他们的“临时寝室”有六里多的山路。他们还集中起伙，雇了一个女社员专为他们烧水做饭，月资十四元，同时还挑选了一位组员管理伙食，这位组员姓谷，外号是“伙食顾问”。
    工作开始的第二天，王局长就特意跑到和住地相隔三里路的沙河街买了苹果、白糖和蛋糕。当他吃得津津有味的时候，孙组长问：“王局长，你到哪里买来这些东西呀？”王局长喜笑眉开地回答：“吃吧！营养营养。”在王局长这种作风的影响下，伙食搞得越来越好了。
    工作组在石门社住了二十多天，他们所吃的菜类，仅晕菜就有小鸡、牛肉、鸡蛋、鲜鱼、兔子肉、野鸡等六种之多；素菜除普通蔬菜外，计有香菇、木耳、黄花、粉丝、榨菜等五种以上。他们为了吃得更可口，还买了芝麻酱。中途还派人跑几里路买油条、豆浆和白糖。王局长和黄、王等四位同志每天还要吃早点——白糖冲鸡蛋。这个工作组仅鸡蛋一项就吃了不下五百个。随着鸡蛋消费量的增大。“伙食顾问”忙得四处奔跑，经常挨户买鸡蛋。正由于他这样“积极”，因而扬出了他的大名。周围几个村庄的农民都知道省委工作组要买鸡蛋。他们吃了这些鸡蛋还不满足，还要吃鸡，而且是一顿三只，每人一碗。
    如果要问他们的工作是否深入？我举出下面几件事，人们便知分晓。
    他们分工是这样的：王大组长和孙小组长专蹲社里抓全面情况。他俩究竟抓了一些什么情况呢？据了解，主要是从该社会计处要了几个数字，组员说他们是：“看报纸的组长。”
    其他组员的工作情况怎样呢？
    有一次，副组长召开小组会讨论调查民主管理方面的问题，决定全组同志下去调查。有一个姓黄的组员没有提出任何理由，公然一整天没下队。那位“伙食顾问”会后蒙起被子睡大觉。一位王同志刮了很久的胡子，出去转了个圈就回来了，副组长问他了解到什么情况，他回答很干脆：“找不到人！”
    四位负责搞第十一生产队的同志，他们每天照例要在社里吃早饭。用过早餐，看看报纸，有时商量商量工作，上午十点甚至十二点钟以后，才慢吞吞地起身去生产队。不到下午四点钟，他们又要跑六里多的山路回来吃晚饭。用过晚餐，休息一会儿便去参加会议。至于个别访问和田间活动，对他们是不大习惯的。
    去年12月11日，这个组在石门社的工作宣告结束。二十多天中，他们除了帮助农业社搞了一下分配工作外，便是整理了一份四、五千字的调查报告。报告中写了些什么，姑且不谈。我只着重提出报告中记载的一个最基本的增产百分比：石门社今年增产13％。实际呢？石门社今年增产39％。一直到二位副组长把材料带到九江，在交际处提交大组同志们共同研究时，才发现这个问题。李副组长开始有些着慌，当时提出要回到社里重新搞过，可是已来不及了，组员同志们早已乘火车返省了。
