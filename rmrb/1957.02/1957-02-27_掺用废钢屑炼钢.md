	Using Scrap Steel Shavings in Steelmaking
	(Our report) The Wuchang Rolling Stock Factory has been massively using scrap steel shavings and "gates" and "risers" from castings in steelmaking since January of this year. This not only alleviates the threat of work stoppages due to the current shortage of Bessemer converter pig iron, but also saves more than 2,700 tons of this pig iron annually, saving the country 300,000 yuan.
	Since the second half of last year, after this factory converted its acid open-hearth furnace to an alkaline open-hearth furnace and used a portion of scrap steel in steelmaking, it wanted to use dozens of tons of steel shavings for steelmaking. However, the sulfur content of the steel produced was too high. After several experiments, a method was found to first convert the steel shavings into ingots, and then mix them with Bessemer converter pig iron to refine into steel. In this way, the sulfur content of the steel was reduced to within the allowable range, and the proportion of steel shavings used reached 70%. Because the use of steel shavings for steelmaking still could not meet the demand, this workshop also devised a way to remove the sand from the "gates" and "risers" of castings that contained a lot of sand, and then use them as raw materials for steelmaking. Now, the factory uses half steel shavings and half "gates" and "risers" of castings in each furnace of steel.

### 掺用废钢屑炼钢

    掺用废钢屑炼钢
    本报讯　武昌车辆厂从今年1月份起大量掺用废钢屑和铸件的“浇口”、“冒口”来炼钢，不仅解除了当前因贝氏炉生铁奇缺而停工的威胁，并且全年能少用这种生铁二千七百多吨，为国家节约三十万元。
    从去年下半年以来，这个工厂将酸性化铁炉改为碱性化铁炉，在炼钢时掺用一部分废钢以后，又想掺用几十吨钢屑炼钢，可是炼出的钢含硫量太高，经过几次试验，先将钢屑化成锭块，然后再掺入贝氏炉生铁中一起炼成钢的办法。这样，钢的含硫量降到允许范围以内，掺用钢屑的比例还达到70％。由于掺钢屑回炼成钢也不能满足，这个车间又想法将含砂很多的铸件“浇口”“冒口”的砂子除尽，再用来作炼钢原料。现在，该厂每炼一炉钢都掺用一半的钢屑和铸件“浇口”、“冒口”。
