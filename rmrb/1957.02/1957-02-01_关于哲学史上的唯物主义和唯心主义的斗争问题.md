Comrade Feng Youlan in his "Two Questions on the Study of Chinese Philosophy History" and Comrade He Lin in his "Opinions on Two Controversial Questions in the Study of Philosophy History" point out that materialism and idealism in the history of philosophy not only have a side of mutual struggle, but also a side of mutual penetration, that is, unity. If we acknowledge that the struggle between them is absolute, and the unity is relative, this view is certainly correct. Marxist philosophy has always held that all contradictory opposites have relative unity. However, the essence of the question lies in how materialism and idealism, as two fundamentally opposed worldviews, struggle against each other and how they penetrate each other (how they unite). Comrade Feng raised some views on this question but did not give a clear answer; Comrade He Lin's article gave a relatively clear and direct answer. Therefore, this article mainly discusses Comrade He's views.

(I)

It is self-evident that the struggle between philosophical materialism and idealism is different from political struggle, and even more different from war. The struggle between materialism and idealism, in itself, is an ideological struggle, and the way of struggle is reasoning. Comrade He said, "The struggle between materialism and idealism does not involve war and killing," "The philosophical front... is far away in the rear, far beyond the range of artillery fire, and not a target for airplane bombing." There is no opposing opinion on this. However, what conclusions should be drawn from this? I think people cannot conclude from this that the struggle between materialism and idealism is not sharp.

Comrade He pointed out that several materialists and idealists in Chinese and foreign philosophical history were good friends, and their disputes were disputes between friends. This is a fact. It is not difficult to find such examples in modern times. Aren't we also friends with idealists who politically support the People's Republic of China and the construction of socialism? But what does this fact show? Does it mean that the struggle between materialism and idealism is not sharp? Is the relationship between materialism and idealism as ideological systems also "friendly"? Under what conditions do materialists and idealists become friends?

Historically, materialists and idealists became friends, of course, due to some accidental factors, such as teachers and students, relatives, family friends, etc.; but the most fundamental reason is that their political positions are roughly the same, or their opinions on the most pressing political issues of the moment are roughly the same, or they have not yet drawn direct political conclusions based on their philosophical views. Suppose Zhang Zai made a political conclusion to overthrow the Song Dynasty, he and the Cheng brothers would not be friends, and the relationship of distant cousins would not matter. Philosophical views and political views are usually closely related; but it does not preclude that under certain conditions, a thinker's philosophical views may contradict his own political views, nor does it preclude that he has not yet drawn conclusions for political action based on his philosophical views. Therefore, under certain conditions, materialists and idealists can be friends. However, philosophy is not after all supra-political, and this or that philosophical view ultimately always directly or indirectly supports a certain political viewpoint. Politics is not indifferent to the philosophical struggle either. Therefore, philosophical struggles and political struggles are often linked together. Why did Emperor Wu of Liang use the "Imperial Rescript Answering Subordinates' Theory of the Extinction of the Soul" to resolve the debate between theism and atheism? This is because atheism itself – even without making political conclusions – is an indirect but extremely serious threat to the reactionary rulers. And once the philosophical struggle involves real political issues, it becomes very fierce, even cruel. We can find many facts in history where reactionary rulers cruelly persecuted materialist thinkers, and facts where materialists and idealists became political enemies; these are no fewer than the facts of materialists and idealists being friends. Neither the fact that materialists and idealists are friends nor the fact that they become political enemies can explain the essence of the struggle between materialism and idealism. If one says that the struggle between materialism and idealism is directly equated with political struggle, according to the latter, it is of course wrong. Similarly, it is extremely wrong to use the former to cover up the antagonism between materialism and idealism and the sharpness of the struggle between them. Where does the antagonism between materialism and idealism and the sharpness of the struggle between them manifest itself? Materialism and idealism are completely opposite in fundamental principles. The struggle between them is a "life-and-death" struggle (of course, not of people), a "I stand, you fall" situation, with no room for compromise. If materialists and idealists compromise, it means that one side abandons its own ideological principles and surrenders to the ideological principles of the other side. The struggle between materialism and idealism is aimed at fundamentally crushing the other side, and the raising of questions and arguments is a matter of the right to exist as a philosophical system, not a trivial matter, not "if you make a slight correction, we will be completely consistent and can compromise." Which of the issues debated between materialism and idealism is not so sharp? For example, which is primary, matter or spirit, whether there are objective laws, the question of the path of knowledge, etc., whether it is a materialist or an idealist, whoever makes the slightest concession would betray his own philosophical viewpoint and surrender to the other side. And the struggle between one school of idealism and another school of idealism is not like this. Under specific conditions, their struggle may be very fierce, even cruel, such as Empress Dowager Dou's intolerance of Yuan Gu Sheng, and Emperor Guangwu also wanting to behead those who opposed prophecies with "the meaning of Confucianism"; this is due to political relations. But one school of idealism and another school of idealism can compromise on ideological principles; a compromise does not mean that anyone abandons his fundamental philosophical viewpoint.

Materialism and idealism are antagonistic, their boundaries are clear, and the struggle is sharp and without room for compromise. We must adhere to this principle when studying their mutual penetration, otherwise, we will blur the boundaries between materialism and idealism.

(II)

Comrade He's article does not explicitly say that materialism and idealism are not antagonistic, and that their struggle is not sharp. However, according to Comrade He's answer to how materialism and idealism penetrate each other, such a conclusion is inevitably drawn.

(1) Comrade He said: "Later idealism often absorbs some of the principles of materialism." Is this possible? The following two situations are common: One situation is that later idealists are influenced by earlier materialism and adopt individual materialist principles. But in his system, it is self-contradictory, like fire and water, idealism is idealism, and materialism is materialism, and the philosopher of history analyzes it and it is still clearly red and white. Another situation is that idealists distort certain principles of materialism and turn them into idealist things, such as the Han Dynasty theologians' view of the ancient Five Elements theory. But neither of these two situations can be called idealism absorbing the principles of materialism. These two kinds of thoughts will not only "fight" in a book, but also in a person's mind, and cannot live together peacefully, without distinguishing between materialism and idealism. According to Comrade He's view, it is bound to be thought that materialism and idealism have the same things in principle (here, if referring to certain philosophers or certain philosophical works, it is of course possible; but Comrade He refers to materialism and idealism). Comrade He sees it this way.

(2) Comrade He said: Materialism and idealism "absorb the parts of the other that are the same as themselves to oppose the parts of the other that are different from themselves," and said that this is "the inevitable process of contradictory development in the history of philosophy," and also cited the example: "Marx used the dialectics in Hegel's philosophy... to oppose Hegel's idealist system." According to this, the part of Marxist philosophy and Hegelian philosophy that is the same is dialectics; the part that is different is materialism and idealism. But in Hegel's system, it is not that one pocket contains dialectics and one pocket contains idealism, so we can take the dialectics from his left pocket to oppose the idealism in his right pocket. Hegel's dialectics and his idealism are combined. Hegel's idealism cannot be opposed by using Hegel's dialectics. Only by crushing Hegel's idealist system did Marx save the dialectics; and only by thoroughly materialist transforming Hegel's dialectics did he enrich materialism. This transformation is not a quantitative change, but a qualitative change. Marx's dialectics and Hegel's dialectics are by no means the same thing. We cannot expect that there is such a thing in the idealist system: it is naturally completely the same as materialism, so that it does not need to be transformed, just take it over. How does idealism absorb the part that is the same as it from materialism? If it is not talking about an incomplete materialist, but talking about materialism, then there cannot be something in materialism that is the same as idealism. It is another matter that a certain incomplete materialist has idealist thoughts that can be used by idealism. Idealism as idealism, materialism as materialism, is clearly red and white, and there can be nothing the same. Comrade He does not agree with the idealism "in general" that is distinguished from idealists and idealist works (Comrade He's speech at the symposium on Chinese philosophy history held by the Department of Philosophy of Peking University); however, idealism "in general" is a scientific abstraction, and its essence lies in advocating that spirit is primary and matter is secondary. Materialism believes that matter is primary and spirit is secondary. It is in this sense that we use the two concepts of materialism and idealism. If it is said that there is idealism in materialism and materialism in idealism, then what strict boundaries do they have?

(3) Comrade He also said at the symposium: "It cannot be considered that materialism is absolutely correct and idealism is absolutely wrong." This statement can only confuse the boundaries between materialism and idealism, and correctness and error. If it is said that the materialist system before Marxism is not absolutely correct, it is of course wrong, but its error lies precisely in its inability to carry out the materialist principle to the end. Marxist philosophy has not exhausted the truth, and in this sense it is not absolute truth. However, its fundamental principles will not be changed by any future situation, and in this sense, it is absolutely correct. Certain idealist works may have certain views that unconsciously correctly reflect objective reality; but it does not mean that the judgment of idealism being wrong is also relative. Isn't it absolutely correct that matter is primary and spirit is secondary? Isn't it absolutely wrong that spirit is primary and matter is secondary?

(4) Comrade He assumes that idealists and materialists are in a relationship of "second in command" and "first in command," and then concludes that: "Materialists and idealists are sometimes in a relationship of 'the student surpasses the teacher', not a red and white relationship." I think this directly denies the boundary between materialism and idealism. Is the relationship between Marx and Hegel a "student and teacher" relationship or a "red and white" relationship? I am afraid it can only be said to be the latter, not the former. Even Wang Fuzhi, after going through Cheng Zhu and denying Cheng Zhu, cannot be said that Cheng Zhu is "blue" and Wang Fuzhi is "green." The fact that a materialist was once a student of an idealist, and he finally became a materialist, means that he abandoned his teacher and betrayed the idealist principle. Of course, it is not in vain to have been a student of an idealist, if his teacher's philosophy has a "reasonable core," it is possible to transform it and "absorb" it to enrich materialism; on the other hand, because he "comes from the old fortress," he is also more able to "turn against the enemy" and hit the key points of idealism. According to Comrade He Lin's opinion, materialists and idealists are not antagonistic in principle and position, but only a little "deep" or a little "shallow." Then what boundaries are there? Not to mention the "teacher-student" relationship, even a thinker's transformation from an idealist to a materialist is a fundamental ideological revolution, and it can never be successful by patching up and repairing. The new self and the old self, if using colors to describe them, are two completely opposite tones; this transformation is by no means "going from blue to green." Comrade He's discussion of "the student surpasses the teacher" is precisely in line with his view that materialism and idealism do not have strict and clear boundaries.

(5) Comrade Feng Youlan's article only discusses the relationship between materialists and idealists in history, and does not talk about the antagonism between the materialist line and the idealist line; his conclusion is: "Precisely because there is a 'reasonable core' in idealism, it can have a side of unity or identity in the opposition to materialism, in addition to contradiction and mutual exclusion." That is to say: the reason why materialism and idealism have unity is because idealism has a reasonable core. And Comrade Feng also believes that materialism and all idealisms have unity (it cannot but be thought so), then it is that all idealist systems have a "reasonable core." This is wrong. What "reasonable core" does the theological worldview of the unity of heaven and man and the interaction between heaven and man in the two Han Dynasties have? What "reasonable core" does Chiang Kai-shek's Philosophy of Vigorous Practice have? The "reasonable core" is what Marx said about Hegel's dialectics. Of course, there are some idealist systems in history that contain dialectics, although their "reasonable core" is much smaller than Hegel's, but after all, it is a "reasonable core"; in addition to dialectics, it is still possible to study whether there are other "reasonable cores" in certain idealist systems. But it cannot be extended to all idealisms. Lenin wrote when exposing the epistemological roots of idealism: "Philosophical idealism is a one-sided, exaggerated, excessive... development (inflation, expansion) of a certain feature, aspect, part of knowledge into an absolute divorced from matter, divorced from nature, and deified." These "aspects" and "parts" are reasonable fragments of knowledge materials in their "appropriate" position; if these "parts" and "aspects" are first seen by a certain idealist philosopher, then he has also contributed to human knowledge. But the reason why idealism is idealism is that it is "...divorced from matter, divorced from nature, and deified absolute"; those "aspects" and "parts" are no longer those "aspects" and "parts." For example, the reason why relativism is relativism is because it is absolute relativity, and it cannot be said that it contains a dialectical point of view of relativity – even if it is inverted like Hegel's dialectics.

Thinking that all idealism has a reasonable core, which is the fundamental reason why materialism and idealism can be unified, it is bound to exaggerate the aspect of materialism "absorbing" useful things from idealism, thereby distorting the unity between them.

Comrade He and Comrade Feng generally talk about inheriting the philosophical heritage without distinguishing between materialism and idealism, this is not accidental; but it is organically related to their denial of the clear boundaries and antagonism between materialism and idealism to varying degrees.

(III)

Why are materialism and idealism, which are fundamentally antagonistic and sharply struggling, unified? How are they unified?

The reason why materialism and idealism can be unified is first of all that their object is the same, that is: the universe, making the most general research on the essence of the universe. Some people think that materialism has a special research object, which is wrong. The difference between materialism and idealism does not lie in the fact that their research objects are not the same; but in making absolutely opposite explanations of the same object. If the objects are different, you say your east, I say my west, "as irrelevant as a wind horse and an ox," then there is neither unity nor struggle. Secondly, in each specific historical stage, the philosophy of each nation – whether it is materialism or idealism – is restricted by the same socio-economic, political conditions and scientific level, as well as the influence of previous philosophical struggles; in their most general research on the same object – the universe, the aspects they focus on, the main questions they raise, that is, the central topic of research, are also roughly the same in essence. Therefore, the struggle and mutual penetration between materialism and idealism occur concretely.

Let's talk about how they penetrate each other, that is, unite.

The most fundamental thing is that they stimulate each other, promote each other, or use a metaphor: "'Tao' is one foot high, 'devil' is ten feet high; 'devil' is ten feet high, 'Tao' is ten feet high...." (Of course, this refers to the history of philosophy before the emergence of Marxist philosophy) This situation is roughly manifested in the following two forms: One is to refute each other, stimulating the other side to develop and deepen their own arguments. Here we can say: Idealism is the ideological enemy of materialism, and also the "teacher" of materialism. The other form is: at a specific historical stage, materialism denies idealism or idealism denies materialism, forcing the other side to adopt a new form and move to a new stage. This is particularly complex in the history of Chinese philosophy, and the philosophy of the Middle Ages developed forward through constant repetition and shift (of course, we cannot conclude from this that the ultimate driving force of philosophical development lies here). For example, from the two Han Dynasties to the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The idealist form of the two Han Dynasties was the theological system of the unity of heaven and man and the interaction between heaven and man. In the process of forming this worldview, it also bred things that were contrary to it, stimulating the materialist philosopher Wang Chong to complete an atheistic universe characterized by criticizing the interaction between heaven and man. Compared with the materialist doctrines of the pre-Qin period, it was a new form and a step forward. The theology of the interaction between heaven and man was theoretically crushed by Wang Chong; and the storm of peasant wars practically deprived it of its power to exist. Emperor Guangwu of Han "announced prophecies to the world"; and by the time of Liu Song, all books related to prophecies were to be burned. That is to say, the theoretical struggle and the development of practice forced idealism to adopt new forms. In the Southern and Northern Dynasties, a new form of idealism emerged in the guise of Buddhism, characterized by the indestructibility of the spirit when the body decays. Its discussion of the relationship between body and spirit unfolded and deepened; although its answer was wrong. And this situation stimulated the development of materialism. The new form of materialism – Fan Zhen's "Theory of the Extinction of the Soul" was produced in the debate on the relationship between body and spirit. Without the debate between idealism and materialism on the relationship between body and spirit, it would be difficult for Fan Zhen's genius proposition of the "blade of profit" (the relationship between spirit and form) to appear. The above-mentioned situation is universal in the history of philosophical development. It can be said that the history of philosophy is the process of materialism and idealism stimulating each other, promoting each other, so that each transforms from the old form to the new form.

In this process, it includes the side of "critically" "transforming" (it is more appropriate to call it distortion from the idealist side) the knowledge provided by the other side to enrich oneself or change one's own form. From the materialist point of view, it is to critically absorb the reasonable core contained in the idealist system (if any), or to critically absorb the fragmentary knowledge materials provided by idealism. If the former is compared to finding pearls from a garbage heap, then the latter is to restore those damaged "aspects" and "parts." After restoration, it is a nutrient. This is "unity" and struggle. Idealism also "absorbs" materials from materialism, but it is distorted. For example, the theology of the two Han Dynasties absorbed the materials of primitive materialism - the theory of the Five Elements - in the pre-Qin period and distorted them to support its fundamental point of view. It is not difficult for us to find such traces in "Spring and Autumn Luxuriant Dew" and "White Tiger Tong". Comrade He Lin explained materialism and idealism "absorbing each other" as a situation without struggle, "absorbing the parts of the other that are the same as themselves". This kind of "smooth" absorption is impossible. One school of idealism can absorb ready-made things from that school of idealism because they are all idealism; but materialism and idealism cannot absorb ready-made things from each other because they are fundamentally opposite and fundamentally antagonistic.

Of course, the actual situation is more complicated than what we said above. For example, dualism, it is attacked by both thorough idealism and thorough materialism; at the same time, thorough idealism and thorough materialism absorb from it things that are useful to themselves. For example, there is not only the struggle between materialism and idealism, but also the struggle between one school of idealism and another school of idealism; not only the mutual negation of materialism and idealism, but also the negation of one idealist form to another idealist form. This often has a great impact on the development of materialism. However, no matter how complex the situation of mutual penetration and mutual influence is, as two fundamentally opposed lines, materialism and idealism, their boundaries are still very clear; not seeing this is to turn "unity" into "mixing".

(IV)

Comrade He's article also mentioned the struggle between materialism and idealism at the beginning. However, it is not that adding two "one-sidednesses" equals comprehensiveness. The struggle and unity between materialism and idealism are mutually restrictive and have an internal organic connection. If one aspect is excessively and one-sidedly exaggerated, the other aspect is essentially denied; even if the other side is mentioned in words, it can only be a formal "passing through," a "vain talk," which is of no help. Comrade He is precisely like this: according to his understanding of the unity of materialism and idealism, he essentially denies the struggle between them and their fundamental antagonism.

It seems that we must also launch a two-front struggle on this issue. The view that only acknowledges the struggle between materialism and idealism and denies their mutual unity and mutual penetration is a crude metaphysical view. As Comrade Feng and Comrade He said, under the domination of this view, the rich and colorful history of Chinese philosophy will be made very poor and monotonous. However, inappropriately emphasizing the unity of materialism and idealism, and essentially denying their antagonism and struggle, is also a crude metaphysical view. It will lead us down the wrong path of blurring the principled boundaries of materialism and idealism. If we move even slightly in the direction of blurring the boundaries between materialism and idealism in the methodology of studying the history of philosophy, then our work on the history of philosophy will also enter a dead end.

    关于哲学史上的唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争问题	关锋
    冯友兰先生在“关于中国哲学史研究的两个问题”、贺麟先生在“对于哲学史研究中两个争论问题的意见”文中指出：哲学史上的唯物主义和唯心主义不但有互相斗争的一面，而且有互相渗透，即统一的一面。如果承认它们之间的斗争是绝对的，统一是相对的，这种看法当然是对的。马克思主义哲学从来就认为：一切矛盾着的对立面具有相对的统一性。但是，问题的实质在于作为两种根本对立的宇宙观——唯物主义和唯心主义是怎样相互斗争，怎样相互渗透（怎样统一）的。冯先生对这个问题，提出了一些看法，而没有明确的回答；贺麟先生的文章却作出了比较明确和直接的回答。所以我这篇文章，主要地是讨论贺先生的意见的。
                        （一）
    哲学上的唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争，不同于政治斗争，更不同于战争，这是不言而喻的。唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争，就其本身来说是思想斗争，斗争的方式是说理。贺先生说：“唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争没有通过战争杀人的方式”，“哲学战线……远处在后方，远处在大炮射程之外，也不是飞机轰炸的目标。”对这，是没有相反的意见的。但是，由此应该得出什么结论来呢？我想，人们不能够根据这一点而得出唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争并不尖锐的结论。
    贺先生指出中外哲学史上若干唯物主义和唯心主义者是很好的朋友，他们之间的争论是朋友之间的争论。这是事实。在现代也不难找到这样的例子。我们跟在政治上拥护中华人民共和国、拥护社会主义建设的唯心主义者，不也是作朋友吗？但是，这个事实到底说明了什么呢？是否说明唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争并不尖锐呢？作为思想体系的唯物主义和唯心主义是否也是“朋友”般的关系呢？唯物主义者和唯心主义者是在怎样的条件下成为朋友的呢？
    历史上唯物主义者和唯心主义者作朋友，当然有些偶然的因素，如师生、亲戚、世交等；但最基本的却是他们的政治立场大体一致，或是在当前最迫切的政治问题上意见大体一致，或是他们暂时还没有根据他们的哲学观点作出直接的政治结论。假设张载竟作出推翻宋朝统治的政治结论，他和二程也就作不成朋友，表叔侄的关系也就不算什么了。哲学观点和政治观点通常是密切联系的；但并不排斥在一定条件下，一个思想家的哲学观点和他自己的政治观点相矛盾，也不排斥他还没有根据自己的哲学观点作出政治行动的结论。因此，在一定条件下唯物主义者和唯心主义者是可以作朋友的。但是，哲学毕竟不是超政治的，这样或那样的哲学观点归根到底总是直接或间接支持一定的政治观点的。政治对于哲学斗争也不是漠不关心的。所以哲学斗争和政治斗争常常联系起来。梁武帝为什么用“敕答臣下神灭论”的诏书来解决有神论和无神论的争论？这就是因为，无神论自身——就是还没有作出政治上的结论，对于反动统治者说来也是一种间接的但是极严重的威胁。而哲学斗争一涉及到现实政治问题，就很激烈，甚至很残酷了。我们在历史上可以找到许多反动统治者残酷地迫害唯物主义思想家的事实、唯物主义者跟唯心主义者成为政治上敌人的事实；这并不比唯物主义者和唯心主义者作朋友的事实更少些。无论唯物主义者和唯心主义者作朋友的事实，他们成为政治上的敌人的事实，都不能说明唯物主义和唯心主义斗争的实质。如果根据后者，就说唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争和政治斗争直接等同，当然是错误的。同样，用前者来掩盖唯物主义和唯心主义的敌对性和它们之间的斗争的尖锐性，也是极端错误的。唯物主义和唯心主义的敌对性、它们之间的斗争的尖锐性，表现在什么地方呢？唯物主义和唯心主义在根本原则上是完全相反的。它们之间的斗争是“你死我活”（当然不是人的死活）、“我立你倒”，没有妥协的余地。唯物主义者和唯心主义者妥协了，那是意味着一方放弃了自己的思想原则，向对方的思想原则投降。唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争都是要从根本上摧垮对方，问题的提出和辩难是作为哲学体系的存在权利问题，而不是枝节问题，不是“你稍微修正一下，我们就完全一致了、可以妥协了”。唯物主义和唯心主义争论的问题哪一个不是这样尖锐呢？如物质和精神谁是第一性的、有无客观规律、认识的路线问题等等，不管是唯物主义者还是唯心主义者，谁要是稍微让步，就会是背叛自己的哲学观点，而向对方投降。而这一派唯心主义和那一派唯心主义的斗争就不是这样。在特定条件下他们的斗争可能是很激烈的、甚至是残酷的，如窦太后不能容辕固生，光武对于以“儒家之义”反对图谶的人也要砍头；这是由于政治的关系。而唯心主义这一派和那一派在思想原则上是可以妥协的；妥协了并不意味着谁放弃了自己的根本哲学观点。
    唯物主义和唯心主义是敌对的，其界限是分明的，斗争是尖锐的、没有妥协余地的。我们研究它们的相互渗透时必须坚持这个原则，否则就会混淆唯物主义和唯心主义的界限。
                        （二）
    贺先生的文章，在字面上没有说唯物主义和唯心主义不是敌对的，其斗争是不尖锐的。但是，按着贺先生对唯物主义和唯心主义怎样相互渗透的回答，却必然得出这样的结论。
    （一）贺先生说：“晚出的唯心主义往往也吸收了一些唯物主义的原则”。这是可能的吗？以下两种情况倒是常有的：一种情况是晚出的唯心主义者受了先行的唯物主义的影响，采取了个别的唯物主义原则。但在他的体系中是自相矛盾、犹如水火，唯心主义自是唯心主义，唯物主义自是唯物主义，哲学史家把它剖析出来还是红白分明的。再一种情况是，唯心主义者把唯物主义的某些原则加以歪曲，变成唯心主义的东西，如汉代神学家之对于上古的五行说。可是这两种情况都不能叫做唯心主义吸收唯物主义的原则。这两种思想不仅在一部著作里，就是在一个人的头脑里也要“打架”，而不能和平共居、唯物唯心不分的。按贺先生这个观点推论下去，必然认为唯心主义和唯物主义在原则上有相同的东西（这里如果指的某些哲学家或某些哲学著作，当然是可能的；可是贺先生指的是唯物主义跟唯心主义）。贺先生正是这样看的。
    （二）贺先生说：唯物主义和唯心主义“吸收对方与自己相同的部分来反对对方与自己相异的部分”，并说这是“哲学史矛盾发展的必然过程”，还举例说：“马克思利用黑格尔哲学中的辩证法……来反对黑格尔的唯心主义体系”。照这样说来，马克思主义哲学和黑格尔哲学相同的部分是辩证法；相异的部分是唯物主义和唯心主义。但是在黑格尔那里并不是一个口袋里装着辩证法，一个口袋里装着唯心主义，因而我们可以从他左边口袋里拿来辩证法反对他右边口袋里的唯心主义的。黑格尔的辩证法和他的唯心主义是结合在一起的。用黑格尔的辩证法是反对不了黑格尔的唯心主义的。马克思摧垮黑格尔的唯心主义体系才救出了辩证法；把黑格尔的辩证法加以彻底地唯物主义改造，才丰富了唯物主义。这个改造不是量变，而是质变。马克思的辩证法和黑格尔的辩证法绝不是一个东西。我们不能指望唯心主义体系中有这样的东西：它天然地和唯物主义完全相同，以致用不着改造，只消把它拿过来就行了。唯心主义又怎样从唯物主义中吸收和它相同的那一部分呢？如果说的不是不彻底的唯物主义者，而是说的唯物主义，那末唯物主义中是不能有与唯心主义相同的东西的。某个不彻底的唯物主义者有唯心主义思想可资唯心主义利用，那是另外一回事。唯心主义作为唯心主义，唯物主义作为唯物主义，是红白分明，不能有什么相同的东西的。贺先生不同意有与唯心主义者和唯心主义著作相区别的唯心主义“一般”（贺先生在北京大学哲学系召开的中国哲学史问题座谈会上的发言）；然而，唯心主义“一般”却是一个科学的抽象，它的实质在于主张精神是第一性的、物质是第二性的。唯物主义认为物质是第一性的、精神是第二性的。我们正是在这个意义上使用唯物主义和唯心主义这两个概念的。如果说唯物主义中有唯心主义、唯心主义中有唯物主义，那它们还有什么严格的界限呢？
      （三）贺先生在座谈会上还说：“不能认为唯物主义绝对正确，唯心主义绝对错误。”这种说法只能混淆唯物主义跟唯心主义、正确跟错误的界限。如果说马克思主义以前的唯物主义体系不是绝对正确，当然是不对的，然而它的错误处却正在于不能把唯物主义原则贯彻到底。马克思主义哲学并没有穷尽真理，从这个意义上说它不是绝对真理。但是，它的根本原则却是不会为将来的任何情况所改变的，从这个意义上说，它又是绝对正确的。某些唯心主义的著作可能有某些观点不自觉地正确的反映了客观实在；但是却不是说唯心主义错误的断语也有相对性。难道物质是第一性的、精神是第二性的，不是绝对正确吗？精神是第一性的、物质是第二性的，不是绝对错误吗？
      （四）贺先生把唯心主义者和唯物主义者假定为“二把手”和“大把手”的关系，于是引出结论说：“唯物主义者与唯心主义者有时是‘青出于蓝而胜于蓝’的关系，不是红与白的关系。”我看这就直截了当地否认了唯物主义和唯心主义的界限。马克思和黑格尔是“青”“蓝”关系还是“红”“白”关系？恐怕只能说是后者，而不是前者。就是王夫之经过程朱而否定了程朱，也不能说程朱是“蓝”，而王夫之是“青”。唯物主义者曾经作过唯心主义者的学生，而他终于成了唯物主义者，就表示他抛弃了他的老师，背叛了唯心主义原则。当然也不是白白作过唯心主义者的学生的，如果他的老师的哲学有“合理的内核”，是可能加以改造而“吸收”来丰富唯物主义的；另一方面他因为“从旧垒中来”，也更能“反戈一击”、打中唯心主义的要害。照贺麟先生的意见，唯物主义者和唯心主义者在原则立场上并不是敌对的，不过“深”一点、“浅”一点罢了。那还有什么界限呢？慢说“师生”之间，就是一个思想家从唯心主义转变成唯物主义者，也是一个根本的思想革命，绝不是修补修补就能成功的。新我和旧我，如果用颜色来说，是两种绝然相反的色调；这个转变绝不是“出蓝入青”。贺先生的“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”的议论，正是和他的唯物主义、唯心主义并没有严格、分明的界限的观点一脉相通的。
      （五）冯友兰先生的文章只是谈论历史上唯物主义者和唯心主义者关系，而不谈唯物主义路线和唯心主义路线的敌对性；他得出的结论是：“正因为唯心主义中也有其‘合理的内核’，所以它能在与唯物主义的对立中，除矛盾和互相排斥之外，还可以有统一或同一底一面。”这就是说：唯物主义和唯心主义所以具有统一性，就是因为唯心主义有合理的内核。而冯先生又认为唯物主义和一切唯心主义都有统一性（也不能不这样认为），那末就是一切唯心主义体系都有“合理内核”了。这是错误的。两汉天人感应的神学宇宙观有什么“合理的内核”呢？蒋介石的力行哲学有什么“合理的内核”呢？“合理内核”是马克思对黑格尔的辩证法说的。固然历史上还有些唯心主义体系内包含有辩证法，尽管其“合理内核”较之黑格尔小得多，但究竟是“合理的内核”；除了辩证法以外，某些唯心主义体系中是否还有别的“合理内核”也还可以研究。但是却不可以把它推广于所有唯心主义。列宁在揭露唯心主义的认识论根源时写道：“哲学唯心主义是把认识的某一个特征、方面、部分片面地、夸大地、过分地……发展（膨胀、扩大）为脱离了物质、脱离了自然、神化了的绝对。”这些“方面”、“部分”在其“适当”的地位上是合理的片段知识材料；如果这些“部分”、“方面”是某一个唯心主义哲学家首先看到的，那末他对于人类的认识也是有贡献的。但是唯心主义所以是唯心主义，乃是在于它是“……脱离了物质，脱离了自然、神化了的绝对”；那些“方面”、“部分”已不再是那些“方面”、“部分”。例如相对主义之所以是相对主义，就是因为它是绝对的相对，而不能说其中包含着辩证的相对观点——就是像黑格尔的辩证法那样倒立着的也罢。
    认为一切唯心主义都有合理内核，这就是唯物主义和唯心主义所以能够统一的根本所在，那就必然夸大了唯物主义从唯心主义那里“吸收”有用的东西这一方面，从而歪曲了它们之间的统一性。
    贺先生和冯先生一般地谈继承哲学遗产，而不分唯物和唯心，这不是偶然的；而是和他们在不同的程度上否认唯物主义和唯心主义的鲜明界限、敌对性有着有机联系的。
                        （三）
    根本敌对的、尖锐斗争着的唯物主义和唯心主义，为什么是统一的？怎样统一的？
    唯物主义和唯心主义所以能够是统一的，首先在于它们的对象是一个，即：宇宙，对宇宙的本质作最一般的研究。有人认为唯物主义有特殊的研究对象，这是不对的。唯物主义和唯心主义的区别不在于它们的研究对象不是一个；而在于对同一个对象作出绝对相反的解释。如果对象不同，你说你的东，我说我的西，“风马牛不相及”，那就既没有统一性，也没有斗争性。其次，每一个特定的历史阶段，每一个民族的哲学——无论是唯物主义还是唯心主义，都受着同一的社会经济、政治条件和科学水平的制约以及前代哲学斗争的影响；它们在对同一个对象——宇宙作最一般的研究中，所着重的侧面、所提出的主要问题，即研究的中心课题，从实质上看也是大体一致的。因此唯物主义和唯心主义之间的斗争和相互渗透便具体地发生了。
    下面谈谈它们是怎样相互渗透，即统一的。
    最根本的是它们相互刺激、相互推移，或者用比喻来说：“‘道’高一尺，‘魔’高一丈；‘魔’高一丈，‘道’高十丈……。”（当然这里是指的马克思主义哲学产生以前的哲学史）这种情形大致表现为以下两种形式：一种是互相驳难，刺激对方发展和深化自己的论点。在这里我们可以说：唯心主义是唯物主义的思想敌人，又是唯物主义的“老师”。另一种形式是：在特定历史阶段上唯物主义否定唯心主义或是唯心主义否定唯物主义，迫使对方采取新的形态，推移到新的阶段。这在中国哲学史上特别复杂，中古时期的哲学就这样不断地反复和推移而向前发展的（当然我们不能由此得出结论说：哲学发展的最后动力就在这里）。例如从两汉到南北朝这个时期。两汉的唯心主义形态是天人合一、天人感应的神学体系。在这个宇宙观形成过程中也孕育了和它相反的东西，刺激唯物主义哲学家王充完成了一个以批判天人感应为特征的无神论的宇宙。它较之先秦的唯物主义学说是一个新的形态、前进了一步。天人感应的神学被王充从理论上摧垮了；而农民战争的风暴则在实践上剥夺了它的存在权力。汉光武“宣布图谶于天下”；而到了刘宋则凡是与谶讳有涉的书都要焚烧了。这就是说，理论的斗争和实践的发展迫使唯心主义不得不采取新的形态。到南北朝以佛教姿态出现的、以形谢神不灭为特征的唯心主义新形态出现了。它对形神关系的讨论展开了、深入了；虽然它的回答是错误的。而这种情形又刺激了唯物主义的发展。唯物主义的新的形态——范缜的“神灭论”就是在形神关系的争论中产生的。没有唯心主义同唯物主义对形神关系的争论，就难以有范缜的“利之刃”（神形关系）的天才命题出现。上述这种情形，在哲学的发展史上是普遍的。可以说哲学的史的发展，就是唯物主义和唯心主义互相刺激、互相推移，以致各从旧形态到新形态的转化过程。
    在这个过程中，包含着互相“批判”地“改造”（从唯心主义方面说叫做歪曲更恰当一些）对方所提供的知识以丰富自己或改变自己的形态的一面。从唯物主义方面说来，就是批判地吸收唯心主义体系中包含的合理内核（如果有的话），或者批判地吸收唯心主义提供的片段知识材料，前者如果比作从垃圾堆里找珍珠，那末后者则是对那些被损坏了的“方面”、“部分”进行复元工作，复元之后才是营养料。这是“统一”，又是斗争。唯心主义也从唯物主义方面“吸取”材料，但是歪曲了的。例如两汉神学就吸收了先秦的原始唯物主义——五行说的材料加以歪曲，以支持它的根本观点。我们不难从“春秋繁露”和“白虎通”中找到这种痕迹。贺麟先生把唯物主义和唯心主义“互相吸收”，解释为没有斗争的状况，“吸收对方与自己相同的部分”。这种“平滑”的吸收是不可能有的。唯心主义的这一派可以从唯心主义那一派那里吸收现成的东西，因为它们都是唯心主义；而唯物主义和唯心主义却不能从对方吸收现成的东西，因为它们是根本相反的、根本敌对的。
    当然，实际情况比我们上边说的还要复杂。例如二元论，它受到彻底的唯心主义和彻底的唯物主义两方面的攻击；同时彻底的唯心主义和彻底的唯物主义又从它那里吸收对于自己有用的东西。例如不仅有唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争，而且有这一派唯心主义和另一派唯心主义的斗争；不仅有唯物主义和唯心主义的互相否定，而且有一种唯心主义形态对另一种唯心主义形态的否定。这对于唯物主义的发展往往是有很大影响的。但是，无论相互渗透、相互影响的情形怎样复杂，作为两条根本对立路线的唯物主义和唯心主义，它们的界限仍是十分鲜明的；不看到这一点，就是把“统一”变成了“混合”。
                        （四）
    贺先生的文章，开头也提到了唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争。但是，并非把两个“片面”加起来就等于全面。唯物主义和唯心主义之间的斗争性和统一性这两方面是相互制约的，有内在的有机联系的。如果把一方面过分地片面地夸大起来，实质上就否定了另一方面；就是在字面上提到了另一面，那只能是形式的“走过场”，“徒托空言”，是无济于事的。贺先生正是这样：按着他对于唯物主义和唯心主义的统一性的了解，实质上就否定了它们之间的斗争性、它们的根本的敌对性。
    看来在这个问题上也必须开展两条战线的斗争。那种只承认唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争，否认它们相互统一、相互渗透的观点，是粗陋的形而上学的观点。正如冯先生和贺先生所说的，在这种观点支配之下会把丰富多采的中国哲学史弄得十分贫乏和单调。但是，不适当地强调唯物主义和唯心主义的统一性，实质上否认它们的敌对性、斗争性，也是粗陋的形而上的观点。它会指引我们走上混淆唯物主义和唯心主义的原则界限的错误道路。如果我们在研究哲学史的方法论上，稍微向混淆唯物主义和唯心主义界限的方向挪动一步，那末，我们的哲学史工作也要走入绝境。
