    Watching "Tan Ji'er"  Li Jianwu
    The Chengdu Sichuan Opera Troupe has brought "Tan Ji'er" to life. After the play ended, I felt like waking from a beautiful dream, unwilling to get out of bed, regretting why I had to wake up. Counting the actors, there were only seven in total. Only four main characters. However, the audience didn't feel the play was lacking excitement due to the small cast. I believe that the lovers in the audience, besides stealing moments to exchange knowing smiles expressing their joyful appreciation, were unwilling to take their eyes off the stage to utter a single idle word. To bring a play to this level is truly exceptional.
    But this play is actually very difficult to perform well. Guan Hanqing's "Mid-Autumn Festival Fish Slices at Wangjiang Pavilion" is a Shakespearean comedy. The playwright's ideal intent far exceeds the realistic depiction of life. Details can be nitpicked, but the overall effect is very beautiful. In terms of social significance alone, first, it boldly praises the remarriage of widows, and second, it exposes the ruling class's protection of crime (through Yang Yanei). How can a weak woman, also a helpless widow, escape this dual (etiquette and power) persecution? Even more remarkable is that Guan Hanqing, like Shakespeare, created in his comedy a young, beautiful, respectable, and lovable woman who, despite numerous difficulties, is able to overcome them with her own strength (character and wisdom). Moreover, compared to Shakespeare's comedies, although the legendary nature is strong, Guan Hanqing's comedy, at its best, is more directly connected to life.
    In this respect, Guan Hanqing (13th century) was ahead of Shakespeare (late 16th, early 17th century). He elevated the legendary realm on the basis of ordinary people's real life, creating several intelligent, capable, and courageous female characters with distinct personalities for our dramatic literature. However, Tan Ji'er is different from Zhao Pan'er in "Saving the Dust." First of all, Zhao Pan'er is a prostitute, while Tan Ji'er was initially a scholar's wife, and later a prefect's wife. Class status should have a significant impact on her personality. She is young and enjoys the pleasure of painting eyebrows with her husband, but she is by no means frivolous. She has insight, choosing a husband for herself (the Sichuan opera adaptation is much more emotional and reasonable in this scene than the zaju play), loving him as she loves herself. She has hatred, because she blames Yang Yanei's persecution on herself. She has courage, daring to come up with countermeasures when ordinary people (a lady of status) are at a loss, and personally implement them. Courage and wit make her lively and also make her the driving force of the comedy.
    Comrade Yang Shuying has created this respectable and lovable image. Being good-looking, singing beautifully, and acting properly are all fine, because these are the professional requirements that opera actors of her kind should possess. Her meticulous study of the character's personality and inner activities, through nuanced performances, has reached an artistic realm with strong infectious power. She disguises herself as a fisherwoman, steals the imperial decree and the Shangfang sword, one face at one moment, several expressions in a turn, not to mention her skillful hands and body, what is even more unforgettable is her lively eyes, cheeks, and lips. The entire universe would fall before her, let alone an incompetent and unlearned clown like Yang Yanei! From the mastery of her character, she makes the audience believe in her success. And this is precisely Guan Hanqing's intention in creating such a spirited woman.
    Even the colors she chooses for her costumes, from elegant and light (widow) to finally bright red (the prefect's wife with victory in hand), are neither vulgar nor do they fail to illustrate her environment and status.
    It's not just her who is like this. Every actor is competent and joyful, and the style is clear. The comrade playing Yang Yanei throws his sleeves boldly and with particular humor. The bookish image of Bai Shizhong also reflects that he is a sincere gentleman. Most commendable are the two actors playing Zhang Qian and Li Wan. When it's time to make noise, they make noise; when it's not time to make noise, they stand aside quietly, never stepping out of their role by an inch. The audience also appreciates the dance they perform while controlling the horse for Yang Yanei in that scene.
    What best illustrates that the performing skill has reached a state of perfection is the actor who plays the Daoist priestess Bai. She has no lines and doesn't seek additional lines, her existence is the play itself. Just looking at her infinitely changing yet natural old face, one understands that she is a senior figure.
    To be able to see such a good play, besides thanking the beautiful and seamless cooperation of the equally skilled actors, we must first thank our great Guan Hanqing. Without his zaju play, there would be no Sichuan opera adaptation. However, we must thank the adapter, Comrade Li Mingzhang, who smoothed out the far-fetched connections. If one were to nitpick, the scene of reading the letter might be a bit lengthy. Finally, thank you again and again to the director Liu Chengyun and the young actors' teachers. You don't appear on stage, but thanks to you, we saw a successful performance. (Attached picture)

    看“谭记儿”	李健吾
    成都市川剧团把“谭记儿”这出戏演活了。戏散了，我像好梦初醒，赖在床上，直怨为什么要醒过来一样。算算演员罢，共总不过七个。主要人物不过四个。然而看戏的人，没有因为台上人少，嫌戏不热闹。一对爱人观众，我相信，除去偷出时间，发出会心的微笑，表示一下愉悦的欣赏心情之外，不肯眼睛离开戏台，说上一句闲话的。把戏演到这步田地，可以说是淋漓尽致了。
    可是这出戏实际是很难演好的。关汉卿的“望江亭中秋切鱠”是一出莎士比亚式的喜剧。剧作者的理想意图远超过于生活的真实刻划。细节尽可挑剔，但是总效果却非常美好。单就社会意义而言，第一，他大胆地歌颂了寡妇再嫁，第二，他暴露了庇护罪行（通过杨衙内）的统治内幕。一个弱女子，又是一个无倚无靠的寡妇，怎样才能逃避得了这双重（礼教和权势）的迫害？更了不起的是，关汉卿像莎士比亚一样，在他的喜剧里，创造了一个虽有重重困难，而能以自己的力量（性格与智慧）突破了这些困难的年轻貌美的可敬可爱的女子。而且比起莎士比亚的喜剧来，传奇性质虽然浓厚，关汉卿的喜剧，在最好的时候，却更和生活直接贴合。
    在这一点上，关汉卿（十三世纪）走到莎士比亚（十六、十七世纪之交）前头了。他在常人的现实生活基础上，提高传奇境界，为我们的戏剧文学创造了好几个聪明、能干、敢于行动的有性格的妇女形象。不过谭记儿不同于“救风尘”里的赵盼儿。首先，赵盼儿是一个妓女，而谭记儿初是一位学士夫人，后是一位太守夫人。阶级身分应当大有影响于她的性格。她年轻，和夫婿有画眉之乐，但是决不轻狂。她有识见，给自己挑了一个丈夫（川剧改编本，在这一场，比杂剧入情入理多了），爱他像爱自己一样。她有恨，因为她把杨衙内的迫害算在自己账上。她有胆量，敢在常人（一位有地位的夫人）束手无策之际，想出对策，而且亲身执行对策。勇敢和机智使她活泼，也使她成为喜剧的动力。
    杨淑英同志把这可敬可爱的形象创造出来了。长的好看，唱的好听，演的本分，都也罢了，因为这本来都是她这一类歌剧演员应备的职业条件。她对人物的性格和内心活动的揣摩，通过细致入微的表演，却达到了富有强烈感染力的艺术境界。她乔扮渔妇，盗骗圣旨、上方宝剑，一时一张脸，一转身几个表情，手活、身子活，且不说它，更让人念念不忘的，是她眼睛活、脸蛋活、嘴唇活。整个宇宙会倒在她前头，何况一个不才无学的小丑杨衙内！她从性格掌握上，使观众相信她一定成功。而这也正是关汉卿创造这种有灵性的女子的用心。
    甚至于她给自己选择服装的颜色，从雅淡（寡妇）到最后大红（胜利在握的太守夫人），既不恶俗，又说明环境和身分。
    不是她一个人如此。个个演员胜任愉快，而又格调明朗。演杨衙内的同志，甩袖子甩的又大胆，又特饶风趣。白士中的书呆子形象也反映出来他是一位至诚君子。最难得的是演张千、李万的两位演员，闹的时候闹，不该闹的时候，站立一旁，静静呆呆，决不走出身分一寸。他们陪杨衙内控马那场舞蹈，观众也有好感。
    最能说明表演工夫已进炉火纯青的境界的，更是饰白道姑的演员。她没有戏，也不另外找戏，她的存在就是戏。单看她那一张变化无穷而又自然的老脸，就明白她是前辈人物了。
    能看这样的好戏，除去感谢工力相敌的演员的美好无间的合作以外，首先就要感谢我们的伟大的关汉卿，没有他的杂剧，不会有川剧改编本。然而我们必须感谢改编者李明璋同志，他把牵强的关节抹平了。万一挑剔的话，看信那场戏也许冗长了些。最后，再三谢谢导演刘成钧和年轻演员们的师傅，你们不出台，可是由于你们，我们看到了成功的演出。（附图片）
