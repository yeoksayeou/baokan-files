    Give Full Play to the Expertise of On-the-Job Cadres
    Shanghai Will Transfer Cadres Not Working in Their Fields of Study to New Positions
    According to Xinhua News Agency, 302 on-the-job cadres in Shanghai whose expertise did not match their work have had their jobs adjusted in the past four months. In their new positions, their expertise has been given greater play.
    He Liangchang, an engineer specializing in motor engineering, electronics, and electronic industrial control equipment, is now a senior technician in the electromechanical office of the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He and his assistants are using electronics for scientific research in the automatic control of high temperatures and the determination of mechanical impact forces. This research is closely related to metallurgy, ceramics, metal processing, heat treatment, and other research and practical production. Ten years ago, when He Liangchang returned from abroad, he could not find a job and had to take on work that went against his aspirations. After liberation, he worked as an engineer in a construction hardware industrial company. Because of his active work and achievements, he was elected as a Shanghai Municipal Industrial Labor Model. Lü Chongpu, an engineer specializing in the design and manufacture of hydro-turbine generators, quickly participated in the design of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station after being transferred from a design and installation company in the commercial sector to the Shanghai Hydropower Design Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry. He served as the technical leader of the mechanical part of this design. Yu Renchong, who originally worked as a chief of general affairs in a middle school, has now been transferred to a water transport scientific research institution of the Ministry of Communications to participate in research work according to his request, because he specializes in transportation studies. Zhao Yanhe, who specializes in German and machinery, has resigned from his position as the manager of a state-owned store and has become a good German translator at the Shanghai Chemical Industry Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry. He is actively translating foreign scientific literature on chemical machinery and other aspects from German into Chinese.
    The relevant departments in Shanghai will continue to investigate the situation of on-the-job cadres whose expertise does not match their work and help cadres who are truly not working in their fields of study to transfer to suitable positions.

    充分发挥在职干部的专长
    上海将用非所学的干部调到新的岗位
    据新华社讯　上海有三百零二名学用不一致的在职干部，最近四个月中工作有了调整。在新的工作岗位上，他们的专长得到了更大的发挥。
    专长电机工程、电子学和电子工业控制设备的工程师何梁昌，现在成了中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所机电室的高级技术人员。他正同助手们一起利用电子学进行高温的自动控制和机械冲击力的测定两方面的科学研究，这些研究对冶金、陶瓷、金属加工、热处理等研究和实际生产有密切的关系。十年前，何梁昌从国外回来的时候，找不到职业，以后不得不担任着同自己的志愿相违的工作。解放后，他在一个建筑五金工业公司当工程师，因为工作积极并作出了成绩，曾被选为上海市工业劳动模范。专长水轮发电机设计制造的工程师吕崇朴，从商业部门的一个设计安装公司调到电力工业部上海水力发电设计院以后，很快就参加了新安江水力发电站的设计工作。他担任这项设计的机械部分的技术领导。原来在中学当总务主任的郁仁充，因为专长交通运输学，根据他的要求，现在已经调到交通部的一个水运科学研究机构参加研究工作。专长德文和机械的赵彦和，已经辞去一个国营商店的经理职务，成了化学工业部上海化学工业研究院的一个很好的德文翻译。他正在积极地把化工机械等方面的外国科学文献由德文译为中文。
    上海市有关部门将继续调查在职干部中学用不一致的情况，并帮助真正用非所学的干部转到合适的岗位上去。
