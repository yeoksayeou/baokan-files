Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 15th. Egyptian newspapers continued to criticize U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' plan to support Israel on February 14th. This plan stipulates that "free navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba and the stationing of UN forces in Gaza are conditions for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egypt.

"Al-Ahram" said that the United States is using Dulles' proposal to ensure that Israel obtains huge political benefits from its aggression, which encourages the trend of using force to achieve its goals.

This newspaper said: Who would have expected the United States to degenerate to such an evil and shameless level? It said that the United States' position on Egypt is based on a blatant violation of Egypt's rights in every aspect. But Egypt has decided to fight back.

Anwar Sadat, editor-in-chief of "Al-Gomhouria," wrote in this newspaper that Dulles' proposal is "the most blatant violation of the principles of international law, all recognized moral and fair principles." He said that the United States, by offering guarantees to Israel, has shown that it "wants to be an enemy of the Arabs even more resolutely than Israel."

Sadat said: "We should draw Mr. Dulles' attention to the fact that, despite his army and money, he cannot force us to listen to his absurd logic."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 15th. Sudanese Deputy Prime Minister Mirghani Hamza told reporters from the Middle East News Agency on February 14th that Sudan fully supports Egypt's demand for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba.

Hamza, who is currently visiting Egypt, said that President Nasser and Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil will hold a meeting in Aswan at the end of this month. He said that arrangements have been made for Nasser and Khalil to hold a meeting every three months, either in Aswan or Wadi Halfa, to discuss current affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, February 15th. Washington News: Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States, Al-Khayal, expressed his concern about Dulles' plan to support Israel during a meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs, Rountree, on February 13th.

It is said that the ambassador told Rountree that he believed that the Saudi King would be "very surprised" to hear about Dulles' plan, because this plan largely supported Israel's interests in the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba. Al-Khayal also wanted to know whether the United States was going to use force to support its plan to ensure free navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba.

Rountree told Al-Khayal that Dulles' plan does not advocate the use of force to guarantee free navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba, nor does it advocate the use of force on the Gaza issue. However, he said that the United States advocates resolving the Gaza Strip issue through the United Nations.

On the same day, the State Department issued instructions to the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, ordering the embassy to explain Dulles' plan to the Saudi Arabian King, who is visiting Spain. The State Department wanted the U.S. Embassy to try to obtain Saudi Arabia's understanding and, if possible, also obtain his sponsorship.

    加沙地区和亚喀巴湾不容侵犯
    埃及舆论痛斥美国无耻袒护以色列
    苏丹全力支持埃及要以色列无条件撤军
    新华社开罗15日电　埃及报纸14日继续抨击美国国务卿杜勒斯支持以色列的计划。这项计划规定支持亚喀巴湾“自由通航”和联合国部队驻在加沙作为以色列军队撤出埃及的条件。
    “金字塔报”说，美国用杜勒斯提出的建议来保证以色列由于进行侵略而获得巨大的政治利益，这样就鼓励了使用武力来达到目的的趋势。
    这家报纸说：谁会料到美国竟然堕落到这样邪恶和无耻的地步呢？它说，美国对埃及的立场在每个方面都是基于对埃及的权利的粗暴的侵犯。但是埃及已经决定应战。
    “共和国报”主编安瓦尔·萨达特在这家报纸上写道，杜勒斯的建议是“对国际法的原则、所有公认的道德和公平的原则的最粗暴的破坏”。他说，美国由于向以色列提出了保证，已经显示它“比以色列更加坚决地想和阿拉伯人为敌”。
    萨达特说：“我们应当提请杜勒斯先生注意这个事实：尽管他有军队有金元，他也不可能迫使我们听从他的荒谬的逻辑。”
    据新华社开罗15日电　苏丹副总理米尔加尼·哈姆扎14日对中东通讯社记者说，苏丹全力支持埃及要以色列无条件撤出加沙地区和亚喀巴湾的要求。
    目前在埃及访问的哈姆扎说，纳赛尔总统和苏丹总理哈利勒将在本月底在阿斯旺举行会议。他说，已经作出安排，纳赛尔和哈利勒将每隔三个月不是在阿斯旺，就是在瓦的哈尔法举行一次会议来讨论当时的事务。
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：沙特阿拉伯驻美大使哈雅尔13日在同美国负责中东事务的助理国务卿朗特里举行会谈时，对杜勒斯支持以色列的计划表示不安。
    据说，大使对朗特里说，他认为，沙特国王听到关于杜勒斯计划的消息会“大吃一惊”，因为这个计划在很大程度上支持了以色列在加沙地带和亚喀巴湾的利益。哈雅尔还希望知道，美国是否将要以武力支持它的主张亚喀巴湾自由通航的计划。
    朗特里对哈雅尔说，杜勒斯计划不主张使用武力来保障亚喀巴湾的自由通航，也不主张在加沙问题上使用武力。但是，他说，美国主张通过联合国解决加沙地带问题。
    国务院同一天向美国驻马德里大使馆发出指示，命令大使馆就杜勒斯的计划向正在访问西班牙的沙特阿拉伯国王进行解释。国务院要美国大使馆设法获得沙特的谅解，如果可能的话，也获得他的赞助。
