Using the Method of "Affirming Achievements and Commending Models" for Education
Cadres and Masses in Various Parts of Guizhou Province Are Greatly Encouraged

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) During last winter, Party organizations in various parts of Guizhou Province conducted a relatively widespread and in-depth publicity and education campaign among the vast rural Party members, cadres, and masses. In the process of education, Party organizations in various localities paid attention to protecting the work enthusiasm of Party members, cadres, and the masses, and adopted the correct approach of summarizing work, affirming achievements, commending models, and establishing banners. As a result, not only did Party members and cadres strengthen their mass perspective and transform their work style, but also inspired the enthusiasm and confidence of the broad masses and Party members and cadres to build socialism together, greatly promoting winter production.

    For example, the Meitan County Party Committee organized some township and commune cadres who had done well in their work to make typical speeches at the three-level cadre meeting, and commended thirty-nine agricultural cooperatives and eighty-three cadres who had performed well in certain aspects and had made achievements in their work. The Taijiang County Party Committee also organized twenty-one agricultural cooperatives to introduce typical experiences at the three-level cadre meeting. The Gaochao Agricultural Cooperative Party Branch in Guizhu County also systematically summarized the work experience of Zhao Shucheng, the director of the agricultural cooperative, and commended good cooperative cadres and members.

    This approach is also a good education for Party members and cadres who have shortcomings in their work or have made certain mistakes. It makes them feel that the Party cares for them and does not simply blame them, thus resolving to overcome their shortcomings and learn from good comrades. Yang Hanxin, a cadre in the Kanmen District of Yanhe County, did not delve deeply into his work in the past. After this positive education, he has moved to the agricultural cooperative and eats, lives, and labors with the masses.

    In addition, Party organizations in various parts of Guizhou Province also conducted education aimed at some negative emotions existing among the masses. The main focus was on summarizing the superiority of advanced cooperatives in a realistic manner, affirming the production achievements of the past year, and summarizing work experience. In this way, the masses saw the achievements of the work, knew that the hard work of the past year was not in vain, strengthened their confidence in running the cooperative well and striving for increased production in 1957, and eliminated negative emotions. For example, after summarizing the superiority of the advanced cooperative, Mao Shuncheng, the deputy director of the Taiping Agricultural Cooperative in Zhanjie Township, Qingzhen County, who originally had low work enthusiasm, said: "The advanced cooperative has so many benefits, why should I be discouraged!" Even Liu Guanghong, a member who originally did not listen to the cooperative cadres and did not obey the cooperative's plan, said: "If everyone is like me, how can the cooperative be run well!" Originally, only 55.8% of the landlord's fields in this cooperative were plowed. After summarizing the achievements, the cooperative cadres and members realized that the achievements in running the cooperative for a year were great, and it was inevitable that there would be some mishaps. Therefore, their enthusiasm rose, and everyone braved the wind and rain to plow the board fields. Some members and individual cooperative cadres of the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Tongren County were also somewhat discouraged at first. After seeing the work achievements, they also actively engaged in agricultural production. (Chen Yongfang)

    采用“肯定成绩表扬模范”的办法进行教育
    贵州各地干部和群众受到很大鼓舞
    本报讯　贵州省各地党组织在去年冬天，向全省广大农村的党员、干部和群众进行了一次比较广泛深入的宣传教育。在教育过程中，各地党组织都注意了保护党员、干部和群众的工作热情，采取了总结工作、肯定成绩、表扬模范、树立旗帜的正确做法，因而不但使党员、干部加强了群众观点，转变了思想作风，而且鼓舞了广大群众和党员、干部一道建设社会主义的热情和信心，大大地推动了冬季生产。
    如中共湄潭县委在三级干部会议上，组织了一些工作较好的乡、社干部作典型发言，并对某一方面表现较好、工作有成绩的三十九个农业社和八十三个干部，进行了表扬。中共台江县委也在三级干部会议上，组织了二十一个农业社作典型经验介绍。贵筑县高潮农业社党支部还系统地总结了农业社主任赵树成的工作经验，表扬了好的社干部和社员。
    这种做法，对工作中有缺点或者曾经犯过某些错误的党员、干部来说，也是很好的教育。使他们感到党对他们是爱护的，并没有单纯责备他们，从而下决心克服缺点，向好的同志学习。沿河县坎门区干部杨汉新，过去工作不深入。经过这次正面教育，已经搬到农业社和群众同吃、同住、同劳动了。
    此外，贵州省各地党组织还针对着群众中存在着的一些消极情绪，进行了教育。主要是实事求是地总结了高级社的优越性，肯定了一年来的生产成绩，总结了工作经验。这样一来，群众看到了工作成绩，知道了一年来的辛苦不是白费的，把社办好、争取1957年增产的信心加强了，消极情绪也随之消除。如清镇县占街乡太平农业社，在总结了高级社的优越性以后，原来工作情绪不高的副主任毛顺成说：“高级社有这么多的好处，我为什么要泄气呢！”连原来不听社干部指挥、不服从社里计划的社员刘光红也说：“如果大家都和我一样，怎么能把社办好！”原来这个社的老板田只犁了55.8％，在总结成绩以后，社干部和社员都认识到：办社一年来成绩是很大的，出点岔子也是难免的，因而情绪高涨，大家一齐冒着风雨去翻犁板田。铜仁县星光农业社的某些社员和个别社干部，原来也有些泄气，看到工作成绩以后，也积极进行农业生产。　（陈永方）
