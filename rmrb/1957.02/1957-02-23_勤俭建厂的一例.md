    An Example of Building a Factory Through Diligence and Thrift
    Wang Wu Ying
    Within a year, the Dalian Plastics Factory in Lüda City, with minimal investment, built a factory capable of manufacturing Liberation brand automobile steering wheels.

    The nitrocellulose plastic steering wheel is a new product in our country, and the technology and equipment are quite complex. The comrades who prepared for the construction of this factory overcame technical and equipment difficulties with the help of Soviet experts, enabling this new product to be put into production quickly to meet the needs of Liberation brand automobile production. Not only are the factory buildings old, but most of the main equipment has also been modified from old equipment. For example, more than ten hydraulic presses of 150 tons and 250 tons, the main equipment for pressing steering wheels and celluloid blocks, were all modified from machines left over from the Japanese puppet regime used to press soybean cakes. Each cost only 2,000 yuan, while buying a new hydraulic press of this type would cost 30,000 yuan. This item alone saved the country more than 300,000 yuan in investment. Other equipment, such as boilers, motors, and various storage tanks, were also old equipment utilized from other local factories. Including more than 20 main equipment pieces such as mixers, rolling mills, extruders, and slicers, as well as other auxiliary equipment required for the production of steering wheels and celluloid sheets, the total investment (including the expansion project in 1956) was only 771,900 yuan. If all new equipment were used to build such a factory, it would cost at least twice as much in investment.

    Now the factory has four workshops, capable of producing steering wheels, automobile control lever handles, celluloid sheets, etc., creating more than 3 million yuan of wealth for the country each year. In addition, the factory has successfully trial-produced a new plastic product—automobile asphalt plastic battery cases, which can replace the commonly used rubber battery cases, not only are they cheaper, but they can also save rubber and foreign exchange for the country.

    In the Second Five-Year Plan, this factory also plans to use the factory's idle old warehouse factory buildings for expansion to meet the needs of increased automobile production during the Second Five-Year Plan; at the same time, it plans to increase the production of celluloid products on the existing basis, providing more daily necessities for the people.

    勤俭建厂的一例
    王五英
    旅大市大连塑料厂在一年的时间内，花很少的投资，建成一个能够制造解放牌汽车方向盘的工厂。
    硝酸纤维塑料方向盘在我国是一种新品种，技术上和设备上也是相当复杂的。筹建这个厂的同志们，在苏联专家的帮助下克服了技术上和设备上的困难，使这项新产品能够很快地投入生产，满足了解放牌汽车生产的需要。这个工厂不仅厂房是旧的，主要设备大部分也是利用旧设备改装的。如压制方向盘和赛璐珞块的主要设备一百五十吨和二百五十吨的水压机共十余台，全部是利用日伪统治时期遗留下的压榨豆饼的机器改装的，每台只花两千元，而新买一台这样的水压机，需要三万元，仅这一项，就为国家节约了三十多万元的投资。其他设备如锅炉、马达、各种贮槽等也都是利用其他地方厂的旧有设备。连购置方向盘和赛璐珞板生产所需的混合机、滚压机、挤压机、切片机等二十多台主要设备及其他辅助设备在内，全部投资（包括1956年的扩建工程在内）只花了七十七万一千九百元。如果全部用新设备，新建这样一个厂，至少要花两倍以上的投资。
    现在这个厂共有四个车间，能生产方向盘、汽车操纵杆手柄、赛璐珞片等，每年可为国家创造三百多万元的财富。此外，这个厂还试制成功一种新的塑料制品——汽车用沥青塑料蓄电池壳，它可以代替现在一般用的橡胶蓄电池壳，不仅价钱便宜，还可以为国家节约橡胶，节约外汇。
    这个厂在第二个五年计划，还准备利用本厂闲置的旧仓库厂房，进行扩建，以满足第二个五年计划汽车增产的需要；同时还准备在现有的基础上，增加赛璐珞制品的产量，为人民提供更多的日用制品。
