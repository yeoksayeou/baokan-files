Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 19th: After launching the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, a new atmosphere of frugality has emerged among government organizations and citizens in Changchun.

Expenditures have been universally reduced in all government organizations, groups, and schools throughout the city. The purchase volume of office supplies in many units in January decreased by more than half compared to December of last year. The total value of goods sold to government organizations and groups by all stores in the city in January decreased by 24% compared to December. According to bank statistics, administrative expenses for the entire city in January decreased by 19.8% compared to December.

Last autumn, desks, chairs, and other items were often out of stock in the Changchun market. Especially between October and November, most stores selling general merchandise implemented a registration system where goods were directly allocated to users upon arrival. However, in the past two months, many units have voluntarily requested to cancel their original registrations. Northeast Normal University originally pre-ordered seventy desks from a store but requested to cancel forty of them after the goods arrived. The turnover of various general merchandise stores has decreased by 70%-80%.

In the past, mimeograph stencils, carbon paper, mimeograph machines, etc., were often out of stock in the market, but now they can be supplied relatively adequately. In December of last year, 573 tons of paper were sold, which was still considered severely insufficient. However, after reducing unnecessary publications and utilizing waste paper, only 326 tons were sold in January this year, which basically met the needs.

The sales volume of many high-end goods in Changchun has also begun to decline. The city's department store's sales volume of woolen fabrics in January decreased by 17% compared to the previous month, and watches decreased by 60%. The turnover of state-owned and joint state-private restaurants in January decreased by 13.6% compared to December. High-end dishes in state-owned canteens, such as Peking roast duck and shark fin, used to sell an average of more than ten servings each per day; now, they can only sell two or three servings even on weekends and holidays. Although January coincided with the Spring Festival, the sales volume of expensive foods in stores did not increase much or did not increase at all compared to the previous month. The sales volume of certain canned goods, foreign wines, and other commodities in some stores also decreased to varying degrees.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, February 19th: The economy drive of organizations directly under the Jilin Provincial People's Committee has been universally launched.

The staff of the Provincial People's Committee boldly investigated and exposed instances of loss and waste in the organizations. Many leading cadres took the lead in practicing economy. Some responsible cadres of departments and bureaus do not use cars for commuting or for short trips. According to statistics, the organs of the Provincial People's Committee used to consume more than 6,000 kilograms of gasoline per month, but only used 2,623 kilograms in January this year. Currently, provincial-level units have decided to suspend the publication of twelve internal publications, including six suspended by the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative; the Water Conservancy Bureau decided to merge three publications into one. After these publications are reorganized and streamlined, it is estimated that eight full-time editors can be reduced, and the publication costs can be saved by more than 64,000 yuan per year. Various specialized companies in the provincial commercial system have decided to cancel eleven public horse-drawn carriages. The Management Section of the Bureau of Government Offices Management recently established a Coal Conservation Committee. They guarantee that in the total coal consumption this winter, they will save 413 tons for the country.

Many units have rationally adjusted the use of rooms based on the principle of saving room usage and improving the efficiency of room use. The Finance Department originally planned to ask the Bureau of Government Offices Management for another 100 square meters of space. After consultation and adjustment, not only was it not needed, but also two dormitories could be saved; the Agriculture Department was also prepared to vacate 245 square meters of office space; two directors of the Bureau of Government Offices Management have moved into one office, and the Provincial People's Committee Guest House originally had 15 rooms occupied by employees, but now six rooms have been vacated, which can accommodate 18 beds.

Recently, many organ workers have begun to use old office supplies to work. Various companies in the provincial commercial system have decided that they will generally no longer purchase office supplies in the next two months, and they have also decided not to purchase all equipment that has been purchased and approved. The Department of Transportation is preparing to save a quarter's worth of office supplies this year, and they also plan to save 50% on long-distance telephone and telegram expenses. The Department of Industry decided to save 3,000 yuan in telephone and telegram expenses.

    机关团体学校普遍减少开支
    长春市出现俭朴气象
    吉林省直属机关节约活动收到成效
    新华社长春19日电　长春市在开展增产节约运动以后，在机关和市民中出现了俭朴的新风气。
    全市各机关、团体、学校普遍缩减了开支。许多单位办公用品的购买量1月份比去年12月减少一半以上。全市各商店1月份卖给机关团体的商品总额比12月份下降24％。据银行统计，全市行政费开支1月份比12月份降低了19.8％。
    去年秋后长春市市场上写字台、椅子等经常脱销；尤其是10、11月间，各公杂用品门市部几乎都实行了排号登记办法，货到便直接分配给用户。但近两个月以来，许多单位自动提出取消原先的登记。东北师范大学早先向商店预订七十张桌子，在货到后，要求退订四十张。各公杂用品门市部营业额都下降70％—80％。
    过去，各种打字腊纸、复写纸、油印机等在市场上经常处于脱销状态，现在都能比较充足地供应。纸张在去年12月份销售五百七十三吨，还感严重不足。但在减少不必要的刊物和利用废纸后，今年1月份只销三百二十六吨，就基本上满足了需要。
    长春市许多高级商品的销售量也开始下降。市百货公司1月份呢绒的销售量比上月降低17％，手表下降60％。各国营、公私合营饭店1月份的营业额比12月份下降13.6％。国营食堂高级名菜，如北京烤鸭、鱼翅过去每天平均各卖十多个；现在，星期假日也只能卖二三个。1月份虽逢春节，但商店中高贵食品的销售量并不比前月增加或增加得很少。某些商店罐头、洋酒等商品的销售量还有不同程度的下降。
    新华社长春19日电　吉林省人民委员会直属机关的节约活动已普遍展开。
    省人民委员会的工作人员们大胆地检查和揭发了机关里的损失浪费现象。不少领导干部都以身作则，厉行节约。有些厅、局的负责干部上下班和近道外出都不使用小汽车。据统计，省人民委员会机关过去每月耗用汽油六千多公斤，今年1月份只用了二千六百二十三公斤。目前省级各单位已决定停办十二种内部刊物，其中省供销合作社就停办了六种；水利局决定将三种刊物合并为一种。在这些刊物整顿和精简以后，估计可减少八名专职编辑人员，出版费用全年可节约六万四千多元。省直属商业系统各专业公司决定取消十一辆公用马车。机关事务管理局管理科在最近成立了节约用煤委员会。他们保证在今冬的用煤总量中，为国家节约四百一十三吨。
    不少单位都本着节约用房和提高房屋使用效率的原则，合理地调整了用房。财政厅原来准备向机关事务管理局再要一百平方公尺的房子，经协商调整后，不仅不要了，而且还可以节省出两间宿舍；农业厅也准备腾出二百四十五平方公尺的办公用房；机关事务管理局两个局长已搬进一个办公室办公，省人民委员会招待所原来职工占用十五个房间，现在已经让出六间，可以容纳十八个床位。
    最近，不少机关的工作人员都开始利用废旧的办公用品办公。省商业系统各公司决定在近两个月内一般不再购买办公用品，备购和已批准购置的一切设备，也决定不再购买。交通厅准备在今年节省一个季度的办公用品，他们还计划再节省50％的长途电话、电报费。工业厅决定节省电话、电报费三千元。
