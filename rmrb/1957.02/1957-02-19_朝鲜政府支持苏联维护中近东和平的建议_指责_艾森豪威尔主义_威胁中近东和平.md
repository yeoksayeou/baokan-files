Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 18th: According to the Korean Central Broadcasting Station, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement supporting the Soviet government's proposal on maintaining peace and security in the Middle East and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in the region.

The statement said that the Soviet government's proposal on the Middle East issue, presented in its note to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on February 11, aims to eliminate all national interference in the internal affairs of countries in this region, guarantee national independence, peace, and security, and peacefully resolve disputes through negotiations. This not only conforms to the interests of the countries and peoples of the Middle East but also fully conforms to the interests of peace-loving people worldwide. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the Soviet government's proposal is the most legitimate measure for peacefully resolving the Middle East issue and gives it full support.

The statement pointed out that the United States announced the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine," attempting to take advantage of the opportunity that the United Kingdom and France suffered a disastrous defeat due to their armed aggression against Egypt, which weakened their power, to replace the United Kingdom and France in the Middle East. In order to interfere in the internal affairs of countries in this region and suppress the anti-colonial movements of the people in this region, it attempts to carry out blatant armed interference. In addition, the United States is also creating divisions among Middle Eastern countries and carrying out internal sabotage against some countries. The United States' aggressive behavior towards Middle Eastern countries is a major threat to peace and security in this region.

The statement emphasized that there is no doubt that if the basic principles proposed by the Soviet Union regarding the peaceful resolution of the Middle East issue are observed, the sovereignty and national independence of Middle Eastern countries, as well as peace and security in this region, can be guaranteed.

The statement concluded by saying that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people oppose the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies, support the struggle of the Middle Eastern people for national independence and sovereignty, and will continue to work for peace and security in this region.

    朝鲜政府支持苏联维护中近东和平的建议
    指责“艾森豪威尔主义”威胁中近东和平
    新华社平壤18日电　据朝鲜中央广播电台广播：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天发表声明，支持苏联政府关于维护中近东的和平和安全以及不干涉这一地区各国内政的建议。
    声明说，苏联政府2月11日在给美、英、法三国政府的照会中提出的关于中近东问题的建议的目的在于排除一切国家干涉这个地区国家的内政，保证民族独立、和平和安全，以谈判为基础和平解决争端。这不但符合中近东国家和人民的利益，并且完全符合全世界爱好和平人民的利益。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，苏联政府的这一建议是和平解决中近东问题的最正当的措施，并且给以全面的支持。
    声明指出，美国宣布了所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”，企图利用英法由于武装侵略埃及遭到惨败以致力量受到削弱的机会，自己来代替英法在中近东的地位，为了干涉这个地区国家的内政和镇压这个地区人民的反殖民地运动，企图进行露骨的武装干涉。另外，美国还在制造中近东各国间的互相分裂，对一些国家进行内部破坏。美国对于中近东国家的侵略行为是对这个地区和平和安全的重大威胁。
    声明强调说，毫无疑问，假如苏联所建议的关于和平解决中近东问题的基本原则被遵守的话，中近东国家的主权、民族独立以及这个地区的和平和安全就可以得到保证。
    声明最后说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民反对帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，支持中近东人民为了争取民族独立和主权的斗争，并且要为这个地区的和平和安全而继续努力。
