　　International Snippets
　　Latest Spy Listening Device
　　In the United States, espionage technology has seen new developments. Recently, Mr. De Vilbiss, the manager of a radio equipment company in California, said that his company produces a latest spy listening device. This listening device is only two and a half inches long, can be carried in the hand, looks like a watch, and can eavesdrop on conversations from a distance of 1,500 to 2,000 feet.

　　Moonlighting Telephone Engineer
　　Russell Mason, a telephone engineer from California, recently testified before the state Senate that he had been working in eavesdropping since 1940, installing a total of one thousand wiretaps for the police department in different places during these times. He also described his work situation, saying: doing this kind of work is really like a thief.

　　A Gentleman of Murder for Profit
　　In Eastbourne, a seaside resort in Scotland, lived a doctor named John Adams. He came from a British aristocratic family, was full of gentlemanly demeanor, and was a devout believer, treating people kindly. He liked to associate with old widows and spinsters who had no children, and treated them very warmly. Recently, the inside story was revealed because a wealthy eighty-one-year-old widow he was treating suddenly disappeared. It turned out that this gentleman and doctor was a most vicious murderer. He confessed in court that he had murdered at least twenty-six wealthy widows and spinsters over the past ten years, seeking to obtain property worth 180,000 pounds. He often poisoned the victims, cremated the corpses with chemicals, and threw them into the sea. In addition to stealing the money around them, he also altered their wills, wanting to "give" the inheritance to himself. According to the American "Newsweek" report, this murderer was still reading the "Bible" with relish after he was arrested and imprisoned!

    最新式的偷听机
    在美国，特务技术又有了新发展。最近美国加利福尼亚州一家无线电器材公司的经理德·维尔比斯说：他的公司出品一种最新式的偷听机。这种偷听机只有两吋半长，可以带在手上，看起来像手表一样，可以偷听一千五百至二千英尺距离之间的谈话。
      电话工程师的兼职
    美国加利福尼亚州电话工程师罗塞尔·玛逊最近在州参议会作证说：他从1940年起就干偷听工作，在这些时期一共替警察局在不同的地方装置过一千个偷听电话机。他还描述他工作的情形说：干这种工作，真像一个小偷一样。
      谋财害命的绅士
    在苏格兰的海滨胜地伊斯特本，住着一个名叫约翰·亚当士的医生。他是英国贵族家庭出身，满身绅士气派，又是一个虔诚的教徒，待人和蔼。他喜欢交结那些无儿无女的老寡妇和老处女，十分亲热地给她们看病。最近，由于他所诊治的一个富有的八十一岁的寡妇突然失踪，才把内幕揭穿。原来这个绅士兼医生是一个最凶恶的杀人犯，他在法庭供认，十年来至少谋杀了二十六个有钱的寡妇和老处女，谋取财物达十八万英镑。他常把被害者毒死，用化学药物焚化尸体，投入大海。他除了窃取她们身边的钱财之外，还窜改她们的遗嘱，要把遗产“赠”一分给他。据美国“新闻周刊”报道，这个杀人犯破案入狱之后，还在津津有味地读着“圣经”哩！
