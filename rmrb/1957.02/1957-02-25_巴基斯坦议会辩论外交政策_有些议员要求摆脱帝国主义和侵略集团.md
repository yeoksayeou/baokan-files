Xinhua News Agency, Karachi Dispatch – The Pakistani National Assembly began debating the government's foreign policy on the evening of the 22nd.

Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy proposed a motion hoping that the parliament would approve his government's foreign policy. In his speech, Suhrawardy said that the foundation of the Pakistani government's foreign policy is based on the principle of being friendly to everyone and not hostile to anyone. When talking about his visit to China, he said that his visit to China and the subsequent visit of the Chinese Premier to Pakistan consolidated the friendship between China and Pakistan.

Suhrawardy defended Pakistan's participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, saying that these two treaties are beneficial to Pakistan.

He said that neutrality is out of the question for his country.

On the morning of the 23rd, some parliamentarians from the former ruling party, the Muslim League and the United Front, spoke praising Prime Minister Suhrawardy for adhering to the basic foreign policy adopted by the previous government.

Muslim League parliamentarian Khuro, when talking about the Manila Treaty Organization, expressed dissatisfaction with the recent remarks made by the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the US Ambassador to Pakistan. He said that the meaning of these remarks is that Pakistan will only receive support from the member states of the Manila Treaty Organization when Pakistan is attacked by Russia and China, and not when it is attacked by India. He said that Suhrawardy once said that Pakistan has very friendly relations with China, therefore, the danger of being attacked by China does not exist. As for Russia, he believes that the Soviet Union has no intention of attacking Pakistan at all. He said that under these circumstances, the Manila Treaty Organization is ineffective and completely useless.

Independent parliamentarian Mian Iftikharuddin said: If we agree with Prime Minister Suhrawardy's analysis of the international situation in his foreign policy report, Pakistan will suffer forever. He reminded everyone: Everything Western countries do is for themselves, not for Pakistan. He demanded that Pakistan get rid of the alliances and military treaties it has joined and sign non-aggression pacts with the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China.

    巴基斯坦议会辩论外交政策
    有些议员要求摆脱帝国主义和侵略集团
    据新华社卡拉奇电　巴基斯坦国民议会在22日晚上开始对政府的外交政策进行辩论。
    巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底提出了一个动议，希望议会通过他的政府的外交政策。苏拉瓦底在发言中说，巴基斯坦政府的外交政策的基础是根据对一切人友好，不敌视任何人的原则。他在谈到他对中国的访问的时候说，他对中国的访问以及中国总理接着对巴基斯坦的访问，巩固了中国和巴基斯坦之间的友谊。
    苏拉瓦底为参加东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约辩护，并说，这两个条约对巴基斯坦是有好处的。
    他说，对他的国家说来，中立是谈不到的。
    在23日上午，前执政党穆斯林联盟和联合阵线的一些议员发言称赞苏拉瓦底总理遵守了前届政府采取的基本外交政策。
    穆斯林联盟议员库罗在谈到马尼拉条约组织的时候，表示不满意新西兰总理和美国驻巴基斯坦大使最近所发表的谈话。他说，这种谈话的意思就是说，只有当巴基斯坦受到俄国和中国的攻击的时候，巴基斯坦才会获得马尼拉条约的组织成员国的支援，而不是当它受到印度的攻击的时候。他说，苏拉瓦底曾经说，巴基斯坦同中国的关系十分友好，因此，遭受中国进攻的危险是不存在的。至于俄国，他认为苏联根本没有进攻巴基斯坦的打算。他说，在这种情况下，马尼拉条约组织就没有作用，根本没有用处了。
    独立议员米安·伊夫蒂卡鲁丁说：如果我们同意苏拉瓦底总理的外交政策报告中关于国际局势的分析，巴基斯坦将永远要受难。他提醒大家：西方国家所做的一切都是为了它们自己，而不是为了巴基斯坦。他要求巴基斯坦摆脱它参加的联盟和军事条约，同美国、英国、法国、苏联、中国签订非战公约。
