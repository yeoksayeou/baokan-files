    Between Workers and "Bourgeois Life"

    West Germany's economy has developed to some extent in the past few years. Some bourgeois economists are now touting a theory of "class annihilation." They say that there is no working class in West Germany because, according to them, the implementation of various installment and credit purchase methods allows workers to afford the "civilized goods" enjoyed by the bourgeoisie, and therefore workers have gradually grown into the middle bourgeoisie!

    It would be consistent with the facts to say generally that some workers in West Germany today can afford "civilized goods" such as cars, televisions, electric refrigerators, and even houses. But to know how they acquire the "bourgeois" qualifications mentioned here and what kind of "bourgeois" status they are in, one must specifically look at the actual situation.

    Here are some specific examples.

    There is a printing worker in Bonn who, in addition to working eight hours a day, also works four or five hours in another printing factory at night. In this way, he slowly accumulated enough money to buy a television. But when he sat down to "enjoy" this "civilized item," the fatigue generated by more than ten hours of intense labor a day quickly put him to sleep.

    In Bonn, there is a worker who works the night shift stoking fires. In order to have his own house, he also does day work in addition to his night shift. His wife, in addition to working as a cleaner, also does home handicraft work. In this way, they did indeed slowly accumulate a sum of money. But soon he fell ill due to overwork. Since then, he has been lying in bed unable to work. Of course, the money was slowly used up again.

    Another person engaged in political work, in order to earn more money, returned to his old profession as a stone carver. In total, he has to work sixteen hours a day. He earned more money, but was exhausted. He gained an understanding: "Now I understand...why the workers are so uninterested in politics, because their energy is drained by work, and they cannot care about anything other than wanting to relax."

    These examples are by no means isolated. The West German newspaper "Die Welt" said in October last year: "It is estimated that today those engaged in 'black labor' (which refers to engaging in other work in addition to one's main job—author) already account for one-third of the total labor force."

    According to the same newspaper, from 1950 to 1955, salaries and wages in the Federal Republic increased by about 40%, but the prices of some necessities increased by more than 50%. Thus, for many workers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to even make a living without engaging in "black labor," let alone buying "civilized goods" enjoyed by the bourgeoisie.

    Perhaps those workers who ultimately purchased some kind of "civilized goods" through credit or installment payment methods will feel more relieved. Not to mention that these kinds of "civilized goods" do nothing to alleviate the heavy exploitation suffered by the workers who "enjoy" them, in fact, by shouldering a debt, they also put an extra noose around those who "enjoy" them. In order to continue to "enjoy" this "bourgeois life," these workers who have moved into new houses or are sitting in "their own" cars must work diligently and carefully to avoid being deprived of this "enjoyment" all at once because they cannot afford the installments due in a certain month.

    This is the true situation of West German workers who are being touted by those bourgeois economists as growing into the middle bourgeoisie.

    The West German trade union publication "Arbeitswelt" put it well: "If we increase the intensity of labor every day like this, so that we hardly have time to enjoy all these progressive and very beautiful things... If a person's nerves have become waste due to the pressure of labor, what good is a car, a television, a record player, a refrigerator, or all other good things to him? A truth that has long been known is: most of the very rich people do not achieve their goals through physical labor. Nor is it through wages or salaries. They achieve their goals by cleverly plundering piles of money from the diligent labor of other people." This statement hits the nail on the head. (Lin)

### 工人和“资产阶级生活”之间

    工人和“资产阶级生活”之间
    西德的经济在过去几年里有某些发展。一些资产阶级的经济学家现在鼓吹一种“阶级消灭”的理论。他们说，在西德已经没有工人阶级，因为，据他们说，由于推行了各种分期付款和赊购的办法，使得工人们也能买得起资产阶级所享用的“文明物品”，因此工人已经逐渐地长入中等资产阶级了！
    要是笼统地说西德有一些工人今天能够买得起“文明物品”，例如汽车、电视机、电气冰箱以至住宅等等，倒也符合事实。但是要知道他们怎么样来取得这里所说的“资产阶级”的资格和他们所处的是一种什么样的“资产阶级”地位，还得具体看一看实际的状况。
    下面是一些具体的事例。
    在波恩有一个印刷工人，他除了每天工作八小时外，晚上还在另一个印刷厂里工作四、五小时。用这样的办法他总算慢慢积蓄起足够的钱买了一架电视机。但是当他拿到这个“文明物品”坐下来要“享受”的时候，一天十几小时紧张劳动所产生的疲劳却使他很快地就睡熟了。
    在波恩一个做夜班烧火工作的工人，他为了想自己有一所房子，除了做夜班外还做日工，他的妻子除去做清洁工外还兼做家庭手工。这样，他们慢慢地的确也积起了一笔钱。但是不久他由于劳动过度而病倒了。从此之后他就一直躺在床上不能工作。那笔钱当然也就慢慢又用光了。
    另外一个从事政治工作的人，为了多挣一些钱，他又去做他的老本行——细雕石工。加起来他每天要工作十六小时。钱是挣得多了，但是疲劳不堪。他得到了一种体会：“现在我才明白，……为什么工人们那样对于政治不关心，因为他们的精力都被工作榨净了，除了关心松口气外，其他都无法管了”。
    这些事例决不是个别的。西德“世界报”在去年10月曾说过：“据估计今天参加‘黑劳动’（就是指从事本职以外兼作其他工作的——作者）的人已经占全部劳动总额的三分之一。”
    根据同一报纸的报道，自1950年到1955年之间联邦共和国内的薪金和工资约增加了40％，但是一些生活必需品却涨价了50％以上。这样对许多工人来说要不从事“黑劳动”，连维持生活也都愈来愈困难，更不用说购买资产阶级享用的“文明物品”了。
    或许，那一些靠着赊账或分期付款方法终究购买了某种“文明物品”的工人会感到清脱些吧。且不说这类“文明物品”丝毫也没有减轻“享有”它们的工人所受到的沉重的剥削，事实上，由于背上了一笔债务，它们还给它们的“享有”者额外套上了一条索子。为了继续“享受”这种“资产阶级生活”，住进了新房子或坐上了“自己的”汽车的这些工人们必须兢兢业业地努力劳作，以免由于哪一个月付不起到期的债款而被一下子剥夺掉这种“享受”。
    这就是那些资产阶级经济学家所吹嘘的西德工人正在长入中等资产阶级的真实情况。
    西德工会刊物“劳动世界”说得好：“如果我们天天这样的增加劳动的强度，使得我们几乎没有时间来享受这一切进步的、非常美丽的东西……如果一个人神经上由于劳力的迫促已经成了废物，一辆汽车、一架电视机、一架唱机、一座冰箱或是其他一切的好东西对于他还有什么用处？一个早就知道的真理是：大多数豪富的人都不是由于体力劳动来达到他们的目的。也不是由于工资或是薪金。他们达到他们的目的是靠巧妙地从其他的人努力勤恳的劳动里掠夺大堆的钱”。这话算是说中了要害。（林）
