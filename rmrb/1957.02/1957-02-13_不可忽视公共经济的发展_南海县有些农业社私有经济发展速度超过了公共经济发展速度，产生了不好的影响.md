    The Development of Public Economy Cannot Be Ignored
    In Nanhai County, the Development Speed of Private Economy in Some Agricultural Cooperatives Has Surpassed That of the Public Economy, Generating Negative Impacts
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Southern Daily: After inspecting and studying the production plans of some agricultural cooperatives this year, the Nanhai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has put forward a requirement to all agricultural cooperatives in the county: it is necessary to mobilize the masses and try as much as possible to rapidly develop the public economy.
    The County Committee, in its study of the development of public and private economies in the agricultural cooperatives of the Gang District and the production plans of some cooperatives, found that some cooperatives were not active enough in developing the public economy, and some cadres blindly advocated expanding the private economy of cooperative members, with the result that the development speed of the private economy of the cooperative members greatly exceeded that of the public economy. This is not conducive to the economic consolidation of the agricultural cooperatives and has had a negative impact on the enthusiasm of the cooperative members for collective labor. An investigation of the Xinyue Agricultural Cooperative in Diebei Township, Gang District, found that the cooperative had not actively developed the public economy last year, and the collective sideline production of the entire cooperative was only duck raising. The average income per household of cooperative members from the public economy was 300 yuan, while the income from household sideline production also reached 300 yuan. Last year, the first cooperative of Xia Dong Township earned an income of 286 yuan per household of cooperative members from the public economy, while the income from the private economy reached 260 yuan; in the income of some cooperative members, the proportion of private economic income even accounted for 60%. In addition, cooperative members also spent a lot of time working outside. Now many cooperative members only focus on developing their private economy and are unwilling to work in the cooperative. When formulating the 1957 production plan, the cooperative was initially still not active in developing the public economy, and the average income per household of cooperative members was estimated to be only 350 yuan. Later, after learning from the experience of the Hongqi Cooperative in Haizhong Township, Nanhai County, in developing production in an all-round way, and the experience of Shimen Song Township in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, in developing pig farming, the cooperative mobilized its members to tap potential and revise the plan. As a result, the estimated average income per household of cooperative members could reach 500 yuan.

    不可忽视公共经济的发展
    南海县有些农业社私有经济发展速度超过了公共经济发展速度，产生了不好的影响
    本报讯　据南方日报报道：中共南海县委员会在检查和研究了一部分农业社今年的生产规划以后，向全县的农业社提出了要求：必须发动群众，尽可能设法迅速地发展公共经济。
    县委在研究?岗区的农业社的公私经济发展情况以及一部分社的生产规划当中，发现有些社对发展公共经济不够积极，有些干部盲目地主张扩大社员私有经济，以致社员私有经济的发展速度大大超过公共经济的发展速度，这就不利于农业社经济上的巩固，对社员集体劳动的积极性也起了不良的影响。在?岗区叠北乡新约农业社的调查中发现，去年该社没有积极发展公共经济，全社的集体副业只有养鸭一项。平均每户社员由公共经济所得的收入是三百元，而家庭副业收入也达到三百元。夏东乡第一社去年每户社员从公共经济得到二百八十六元的收入，而私有经济的收入则达到二百六十元；在一些社员的收入中，私有经济收入的比重甚至占60％。此外社员还以大量的时间出外做工。现在已经有不少社员只顾发展私有经济，不愿在社内出勤。在制订1957年生产规划的时候，该社最初对发展公共经济仍然不积极，平均每户社员的收入预计只能达到三百五十元。后来学习了南海县海中乡红旗社全面发展生产的经验，以及山东省阳谷县石门宋乡发展养猪事业的经验，发动社员挖潜力，修订计划，结果平均每户社员的预计收入可以达到五百元。
