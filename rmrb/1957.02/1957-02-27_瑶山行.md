    A Trip to the Yao Mountains
    Lin Ba

    Longing for thousands of peaks,
    Ten thousand mountains, mountain after mountain
    Shoals linked to shoals
    The train, like a swimming dragon
    Flies over the Nine Dragons and Eighteen Shoals〔一〕
    Autumn leaves are yellow, the shoal water is cold
    Water passes through dangerous shoals, white waves surge
    My heart grows two wings
    Flying to the Yao family's ten thousand mountains

    Climbing mountains and cliffs to reach the Yao Mountains
    People walk in the clouds
    White clouds like a vast sea
    Mountain peaks like surging waves
    Yao brothers with ten thousand axes
    Open up the magical mountain road towards the sky

    A clear spring flows from the Yao Mountain forest
    The spring water shines in the sunlight
    The Yao Mountain is like a green wine vat
    The fragrant wine never stops flowing

    Yao compatriots wear black cloth clothes
    With white chicken feathers in their hair
    They come and go in the mountains like flying
    A pair of strong hands
    Turn barren mountains into seas of forests
    The long drum bangs, the rice wine sprays fragrance
    Yao family corn supports the roof beams
    The days of burning〔二〕
    Like mountain stream water, never to return

    Red leaves gently blown by the breeze
    The pine wind roars like the tide, singing
    Piece after piece of red leaves
    Fall on the girl's blue cloth
    Yao girls embroider flowers on the blue cloth
    The flowers smile at the girl
    Pieces of red leaves are like sweet rain
    Watering the flowers to make them more fragrant
    Red leaves, you gently flutter
    Flowers, you laugh to your heart's content
    The girl already has a sweetheart
    And is no longer shy

    Love stretches across the ridges, across the rivers
    I have come to the Yao family mountain
    On the Yao Mountain, all is joy
    Yao compatriots are "dancing and singing in the hall"〔三〕
    On the mountain ridges, firecrackers are set off
    Whistles rise in the middle of the mountain
    The long drum sounds, the singing rises
    The front and back of the mountain are in an uproar
    Old father〔四〕, blocks the road
    Bowl after bowl of rice wine is poured into my heart
    Holding hands, turning in circles
    Our hearts are close to each other

    Night Song
    The moon is like a piece of transparent crystal
    Silver light spills over the Yao family mountains and forests
    Drifting in through the cracks in the girl's window
    A burst of low singing
    There is no fire and no lamp in the room
    The girl sits by the window, listening
    The singing is like the water of a mountain stream
    Impacts the girl's heart
    The moon in the sky waxes and wanes
    The stream water becomes muddy and clear again
    The young men sing and sing again
    The charming singing never stops night after night
    The girl gently pushes open the window
    Two stars shine on her face
    The singing outside the window suddenly changes
    The singing is full of excited emotion
    The girl's heart is like a ball of fire
    Burning the blood all over her body
    Young men, sing loudly
    The beautiful October〔五〕 is coming soon

    Early morning on the West Mountain
    Half a silver moon
    A few golden stars on the treetops
    A touch of red clouds in the east
    Water droplets on the roadside sparkle
    One step, one look back
    Smoke from cooking on the mountainside is like mist
    The Yao family's rooster crows like it's trying to keep me
    A belly full of reluctance cannot be suppressed

    〔Note 1〕 The Nine Dragons and Eighteen Shoals are located between Lechang and Pingshi in Guangdong, and the Yuehan Railway passes through this area.
    〔Note 2〕 The Yao compatriots of Liannan Yao Autonomous County in Guangdong all live in wooden houses. Before liberation, the most vicious means by which the reactionaries persecuted the Yao compatriots was by burning, often burning entire villages and settlements to ashes. There is still a village called: Huoshaopai (Burnt Village).
    〔Note 3〕 The traditional festival of the Liannan Yao compatriots, held once every three or five years, to worship ancestors and celebrate the harvest.
    〔Note 4〕 The Yao compatriots' respectful term for elders and seniors.
    〔Note 5〕 Yao youth of both sexes choose an auspicious day in October of the lunar calendar each year to hold a collective wedding.

    瑶山行
    林拔
         向往千重岭，万重山重重山间滩连滩火车如游龙飞过九龙十八滩〔一〕秋叶黄，滩水寒水过险滩白浪翻我的心长出两翼飞向瑶家万重山
         登山攀崖上瑶山人行在云端白云像茫茫苍海群峰似汹涌巨浪瑶家兄弟万把斧把神奇的山路开向天上
        瑶山丛林中流出一道清泉泉水在阳光下闪着亮光瑶山像只绿色的大酒槽芬芳的美酒永远流不完
        瑶胞身穿黑布衣头插白鸡翎山林间来去似飞行一双粗壮的手把荒山变成海样的森林长鼓乒乓响米酒喷喷香瑶家苞米顶屋梁火烧的日子呀〔二〕像山涧流水一去不回
          红叶微风轻轻地吹来松啸像海潮喧唱一片一片的红叶飘落在姑娘的蓝布上瑶家姑娘在蓝布上绣花花儿在对着姑娘笑片片红叶似甘雨浇得花儿更香艳红叶呀，你轻轻地飘花儿呀，你尽情地笑姑娘已经有了心上人再也不害臊
        情长越过岭，跨过川我来到了瑶家山瑶山上，一片欢瑶胞正在“耍歌堂”〔三〕山岭上，放土炮半山腰里起呼哨长鼓响，歌声扬山前山后闹翻天老公爹〔四〕，把路拦一碗碗米酒往我心上灌手牵手，围着转我们的心肝贴着心肝
        夜歌月亮像一块透明的水晶银光洒遍了瑶家的山林在姑娘的窗缝间飘进来阵阵低微的歌声房里没火也没灯姑娘坐在窗旁倾听歌声像山涧的流水冲击着姑娘的心灵天上的月儿圆了又缺溪里的流水浊了又清年青的小伙子唱了又唱迷人的歌声夜夜不停姑娘轻轻地推开窗门脸上闪耀着两颗星星窗外的歌声突然变了歌声充满激动的感情姑娘的心像一团烈火烧得满身的血液沸腾小伙子呀你高声唱吧美丽的十月〔五〕就快来临
          早行西山上半边银月树梢头数点金星东方一抹红云彩路旁水珠闪莹莹一步一回顾山腰上炊烟似雾瑶家鸡啼似留客满腹离情抑不住
    〔注一〕九龙十八滩位于广东的乐昌与坪石之间，粤汉铁路经过此地。
    〔注二〕广东连南瑶族自治县的瑶胞都住木屋。解放前，反动派逼害瑶胞最毒辣的手段就是用火烧，往往整村整庄被烧为灰烬。现在仍有一个村名叫：火烧排。
    〔注三〕连南瑶胞的传统节日，三年或五年举行一次，祭祖并庆丰收。
    〔注四〕瑶胞对老人、长辈的尊称。
    〔注五〕瑶胞青年男女都于每年农历十月选择吉日集体举行婚礼。
