From mid-September, the Greater Khingan Mountains began to see snowfall. Tall larches, Korean pines, and straight birches were draped with rows of silver icicles. The temperature dropped to fifteen or sixteen degrees below zero. The once-rushing and noisy streams were sealed with a layer of ice, and the forest was so quiet.

At this time, the members of the measurement team of the First Forest Survey Team of the Ministry of Forestry had completed the measurement of forest area and were preparing to rush to Malen to take a boat back to Harbin for the winter. In these freezing days, none of them had a cotton-padded coat. But they walked, sang, and everyone's face was filled with the joy of victory.

How could they not be happy? Although they suffered a bit this year, their work performance was better than any previous year.

The team members arrived at Malen on schedule, set up tents near the dock, and waited for the ship from Mohe. After waiting for more than a week, on the morning of October 6th, the "Bei'an" ship heading to Harbin finally came down.

"Please stop, we are members of the forest survey team and urgently need to take the ship back to Harbin."

"No way! The ship is already fully loaded. The weather is bad, it would be dangerous to take on more people." The ship sailed away.

They were very disappointed. They heard that the "Shenyang" passenger ship and the "Anshan" cargo ship were still docked in Mohe. These two ships were their last hope.

Another heavy snowfall began. The wind swept across the Greater Khingan Mountains and the banks of the Heilongjiang River. The Siberian cold wave came with the wind. In this kind of weather, these team members wearing single-layer clothing, single shoes, and single hats, not to mention standing outside for a while shivering, even when they went into the tent and crawled into the bedding, they didn't feel warm.

"We can't just lie in the tent and wait passively," said Team Leader Lu Yanyun. "We must organize a patrol team to patrol along the river and notify everyone before the ship arrives, so as not to be caught off guard." The patrol team was established, and everyone took turns on guard along the river, braving the cold.

"'Shenyang' is here!" The patrol team shouted hoarsely. Soon, the team members gathered at the dock.

However, the ship sailed away because the riverbank was frozen and it couldn't dock.

On another dark night, the last ship, the "Anshan" cargo ship, arrived. The people gathered at the dock burst into cheers.

This was a huge cargo ship, followed by a long string of tugboats. Because the tugboats were too long and couldn't turn around, the ship couldn't stop, so it left without stopping.

The hope cherished in their hearts for many days was shattered. Everyone lowered their heads and silently returned to their residence.

That night, everyone tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep.

The next day, a team meeting was held. Some people suggested asking the Soviet Union to cross the river and then take a train to Heihe. Some suggested sending a telegram to the central government, requesting to send a plane to pick them up. Some advocated simply staying here and waiting for the river to thaw next year before taking a boat back.

These three methods were analyzed one by one. The first method was good, but it involved diplomatic issues and was impossible to contact; even if contact was made, the river was full of large ice floes, making it difficult for ships to pass. Wouldn’t that be futile! The second method, contacting the central government to send a plane, was useless because there was no airport here and the plane could not land; there were no roads in the forests and mountains, so sending cars would be useless. The third method was even worse, because the team had neither winter equipment nor food reserves. Spending the winter here would mean either freezing or starving to death. More importantly, everyone wanted to go back as soon as possible to do interior design and formulate next year's work plan, which was not easy to complete here.

After discussing and discussing, none of the methods were good. Finally, they came up with the only solution: to break through on foot. Walking from Malen to Heihe would mean breaking through the dangerous situation, because from there they could take a car back to Harbin. From Malen to Heihe, there were about 1,500 li, full of forests, rivers, and mountains. The road was rugged, and it would take a month to walk it without any accidents. Everyone was determined and said, "Let's break through from tomorrow!" But breaking through had its own difficulties. The weather was getting colder day by day, and wearing single-layer clothing and single shoes, not to mention walking for a month, even ten days would mean freezing to death on the road. Fortunately, the cooperative in Malen sold them the only ten or so catties of cotton. With the cotton, they equipped the sick and weak members of the team. The other comrades said, "It doesn't matter, we'll run fast on the road, maybe we'll sweat!" This road was sparsely populated, and you might not encounter one or two families even after walking for a day or two. In order to solve the problem of eating, in addition to carrying some food with them, they split into two groups: one group led by Team Leader Lu Yanyun, to cross the forest; and the other group led by Xin Tiezhu, to walk along the Heilongjiang River. That night, the comrades padded cotton into their single-layer clothes, packed their luggage and food, and were busy all night.

It was a gloomy morning. The mountain chickens had not yet crowed, and the morning glow had not yet appeared. The forest vanguards set off from Malen. As soon as they went out, their bodies trembled with cold, and their upper teeth chattered against their lower teeth, making a "clack, clack" sound. In order to resist the cold, the team members started running like athletes.

The sun had just risen when the team reached the Pangu River. The river was more than fifty meters wide, and both banks were frozen, with ice floes rushing in the middle of the river.

"How to cross this river?" Everyone was worried when suddenly, through the misty morning fog, they vaguely saw a small boat parked in the ice on the opposite bank. Everyone was trying to figure out how to pull it over when suddenly, Communist Party member Wang Guiquan said in surprise, "I have an idea. There are three logs here. We can tie them into a raft with a rope and cross over to pull it over." Everyone clapped their hands in approval, so some people hurriedly untied their luggage ropes and tied up the raft. The brave and resourceful Wang Guiquan crossed the ice on the bank and pushed the raft forward with a sudden movement. How dangerous! The raft lost its balance for a moment, shaking and swaying, almost dropping him into the river. Everyone held their breath for him. When he paddled to the opposite bank and pulled the small boat over, his feet and legs were already soaked. With this small boat, the team smoothly crossed the river and continued to advance.

At ten o'clock at night, they arrived at Kaikukang, ninety li away from Malen. Although their stomachs were rumbling with hunger, no one ate. They lay in their tents and fell asleep like dead people.

The next day, everyone dragged their tired bodies and continued to move forward. A river called "Xiergen" blocked their way again. It was no better than the Pangu River. They found a small wooden raft and crossed two people at a time. The ice floes in the river collided with the raft, causing waves and splashing everyone's clothes. After crossing the river, everyone became stiff ice statues.

Originally, people who worked in forestry loved mountains, forests, rivers, and snow; but now they felt that it was intentionally torturing and threatening them everywhere. Comrade Song Engui, because of illness, couldn't climb mountains, cross rivers, or resist the cold, and fell behind, staying at the Sanhe Station. More team members were mentally exhausted, their faces were yellow, their backs and legs ached, and black and purple blisters had appeared on their feet. There were still 1,300 li ahead of them. At the current speed, it might not be possible to arrive even after walking for another twenty days. The problem was not the length of time, but that they lacked winter equipment and food. It was really difficult!

At this time, the sound of an airplane "buzzing" came from a distance. Everyone looked up in surprise. After a while, the plane flew over the forest and over the heads of this small team. It circled around, unwilling to leave them. "What exactly is going on?" Everyone was guessing when suddenly, it skimmed over the treetops, dived down, and threw down a roll of white things. Everyone picked it up and opened it. It turned out that there was a piece of paper wrapped in wax paper, with three neat lines of Russian written on it. Unfortunately, no one in the team understood Russian. Some guessed, "Maybe they're here to save us." Another person disagreed, "If they're here to save us, who would understand if they write in Russian!" Another person questioned, "Even if a Soviet plane came to save us, how would they know we're here?" More people thought, "Maybe it's a forest fire prevention reconnaissance plane, trying to find out something from us." In short, everyone was at a loss.

Strangely, the plane was still circling over the team, and it was even lower. They could clearly see the driver. Xin Tiezhu took the piece of paper and waved to him, indicating that he didn't understand. The plane seemed to understand his meaning and flashed away.

The next day, the team continued to advance, and everyone talked about the discovery of the plane yesterday as news. As they were walking, suddenly another plane arrived, circled around, and dropped the same roll of paper as yesterday. When they opened it, it was written in Chinese:

"Comrades:
If you need help, please stay here. From 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM this afternoon, a Soviet plane will come to pick you up. Light a pile of fire as a signal so we can find you."

When the team members waved, the plane flew away. At this moment, they were both surprised and suspicious. Team leader Xin Tiezhu asked, "Are we dreaming?" A comrade replied, "Isn't that the letter they sent in your hand?" Another asked, "Can a plane land in the forest?" A comrade replied, "Your 'mystery' will be solved at three o'clock this afternoon." Everyone discussed it with great interest.

Finally, a faint sound appeared in the distance, and the sound became closer and louder. People opened their eyes wide and looked. Sure enough, two planes that looked like dragonflies flew from across the river. They quickly lit a fire, and the plane gradually descended.

"What kind of plane is this?"
"Isn't this the helicopter we saw in Soviet pictorials?"

The plane slowly descended. Four or five burly, tall people walked out of the cabin. A slender lieutenant colonel stepped forward and asked through an interpreter:

"Are you the forest survey team?"
"Yes!"
"It was like looking for ginseng, we finally found you. We've been looking for you for five days. We were ordered by Moscow to find you," the lieutenant colonel said in a loud voice.

At this time, the team members rushed towards the Soviet lieutenant colonel with tears of excitement, hugging and kissing!

The Soviet comrades all stepped forward to comfort them. "You must be tired!" "Are you frozen?" "Are you hungry?" Everyone felt like they were being cared for and warmed by an older brother.

That day, fifteen people were taken away. The next morning, two more planes flew in and took all the remaining fifteen people away. On the way, everyone learned that this was the Soviet government responding to the Chinese government's request to send planes to rescue them. It turned out that the Ministry of Forestry in Beijing learned that the Heilongjiang River had frozen over, and some members of the forest survey team in the Greater Khingan Mountains had not yet returned, so they made a request to the Soviet government. The Soviet government immediately agreed to this request, and the border troops of the Amur Oblast carried out this mission. In extremely bad weather, they searched for several days and finally found them in the forest.

After this group of people got off the plane, Xin Tiezhu and a Soviet major took a plane to find Comrade Lu Yanyun's team. The major comrade worked very conscientiously, responsibly, and carefully. When the plane they were on flew over the Greater Khingan Mountains, he decided to follow the route the team had taken, tracking them down station by station, because he estimated that in such bad weather, the team members were not wearing cotton clothes and there must be sick people lagging behind. Sure enough, Lu Yanyun's team had already walked for seven days, only walking fifty li a day. Three sick people had already fallen behind, and the remaining comrades were too tired to walk when they reached the Eighteenth Station. When the plane landed in front of them, they simply couldn't express their gratitude in words. In the end, these fifty-one survey team members were rescued from danger by the Soviet army in this way. People will never forget the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet comrades.

When this team arrived in batches at the town of Menggedagaqi, the local party and government leaders cared for them very much, provided them with full care in their lives, and even invited them to watch a movie. On the third day, they reluctantly left the town of Menggedagaqi, took a train to Hailanpao, then crossed the river to Heihe, and returned to Harbin from there.

    井业尖兵历险记	本报记者　康伟中
    从9月中旬起，大兴安岭就开始落雪了。高大的落叶松、樟子松和笔直的白桦树上，挂满了一溜溜银色的冰凌。气温下降到零下十五、六度。往日奔流喧闹的溪涧封上了一层冰，森林里是这样的肃静。
    这时候，林业部第一森林调查队测量中队的队员们，已经结束了森林面积的测量工作，准备赶到马伦，乘船回哈尔滨过冬。在这严寒的日子里，他们谁的身上也没有一件棉衣。但是他们走着、唱着，每个人的脸上都带着胜利者的欢乐。
    怎么能不高兴呢？这一年虽然吃些苦，但工作成绩比那一年都好。
    队员们按照预定的时间赶到了马伦，在码头附近搭下了帐篷，住下来等待由漠河下来的轮船。等了一个多星期，10月6日上午，开往哈尔滨的“北安”号轮船终于下来了。
    “请停一停，我们是森林调查队的队员，急需乘船回哈尔滨。”
    “不行啊！船已经满载了，气候不好，再上人就危险了。”船开走了。
    他们非常失望。听说在漠河还停泊有“沈阳”号客轮和“鞍山”号货轮。这两只船算是最后的一线希望了。
    一场大雪又开始了。狂风卷着雪花，掠过大兴安岭，掠过黑龙江堤岸；西伯利亚的寒流，随着狂风袭来。这样的气候，这些穿着单衣、单鞋，戴着单帽的队员，不用说站在外边待一会儿会浑身打颤，就是走进帐篷钻进被窝，也不觉得有暖意。
    “我们不能躺在帐篷里消极等待，”芦彦允队长说。“要组织一只巡逻组沿江巡逻，在船到来之前通知大家，免得临时措手不及。”巡逻组成立了，大家冒着寒冷，沿江轮流放哨。
    “‘沈阳’号来了！”巡逻组声嘶力竭地喊。一会儿，队员们齐集在码头上。
    但是，船开走了。因为江岸结冰，靠不了岸。
    又一个漆黑的夜里，最后一只船——“鞍山”号货轮到了。聚集在码头上的人们沸腾起来。
    这是只巨大的货轮，后边拖着一长串的拖轮。因为拖轮太长，转不过弯，不能停船，所以这只船也没有停留，径自走了。
    多日来怀在心头的希望破灭了。大家低着头，默默地回到住地。
    这一夜在床上翻来复去，谁也睡不着。
    第二天，召开了队的会议。有的人提议向苏联请求过江，然后再坐火车到黑河。有的建议打电报给中央，要求派飞机来接。有的主张干脆在这里住下，等明年解冻开船再回去。
    围绕这三个办法，逐个地进行了分析。第一个办法好是好，但它牵涉到外交问题，而且也无法联系；即使联系好了，江里跑的是大冰排，船只不好通行，还不是白搭！第二个办法，给中央联系派飞机来，但这里没有飞机场，派来飞机无法降落；森林、山野没有道，派汽车也无用。第三个办法更不行，因为队里既无冬季装备，也无粮食储备，在这里熬过冬季，不是冻死就会饿死。更主要的是，大家都想早点回去作内业设计，制定明年工作计划，而这些工作在这里是不易完成的。
    讨论来讨论去，那一个办法都不好，最后想出了唯一的办法——步行突围。由马伦步行到黑河，险境就算突破了；因为从那里可以乘上汽车返回哈尔滨。从马伦到黑河，算算有一千五百里地，尽是丛林、河流和峻岭，道路崎岖，不遇意外，走一个月算是好的。大家下了决心说：“从明天起咱们突围吧！”可是突围有突围的困难。天气一天天冷了，穿着单衣、单鞋，别说走一个月，即使十天也会冻死在路上。真幸运，马伦那家合作社，把仅有的十多斤棉花卖给了他们。拿着棉花，把队上有病的、身体弱的队员装备了一下。其余同志说：“没关系，咱们在路上跑得快快的，说不定会出汗呢！”这一路人烟稀少，走上一天、两天，都不一定会碰见一家两家的。为了解决吃饭问题，除随身带一部分粮食外，并分作两路走：一路由芦彦允队长带领，穿森林过去；一路由辛铁珠带领，沿黑龙江走。这天晚上，同志们往单衣里絮棉花，打行李装粮食，整整忙了一宿。
    那是个灰蒙蒙的早晨，山鸡还没有叫，朝霞还没有露头，林业尖兵们由马伦出发了。一出门，身上冷得直打颤，上牙磕着下牙，“格格”作响。为了抵御严寒，队员们像运动员一样地赛起跑来。
    太阳刚刚露头，队伍到了盘古河，这条河有五十多公尺宽，两岸都结了冰，河心哗哗地流着冰排。
    “怎么渡过这条河呢？”大家正在忧愁，突然，透过迷蒙的晨雾，隐约地看见对岸冰层里停泊着一只小船。大家正在想办法把它拉过来，蓦地，共产党员王贵权惊喜地说：“办法有了，这里有三根木头，用绳捆成木排，渡过去把它拉过来。”大家拍手称好，于是，有人忙把行李绳解开，把木排绑扎好。勇敢、机智的王贵权，越过岸边冰层，猛地把木排往前一推，一个箭步，跳上了木排。好险啊！木排一时失去了平衡，东摇西幌，差一点把他掉到河里。大家都为他捏了一把汗。当他划到对岸，拉过小船时，他的脚和腿已经被水浸湿。有了这条小船。队伍顺利地渡过了这条河，继续向前挺进了。
    夜十时，他们到了离马伦九十里地的开库康，虽然肚子饿得“咕咕”叫，但谁也没有吃饭，躺在帐篷里像死人一样睡着了。
    第二天，大家拖着疲惫的身子继续前进。一条叫“锡尔根”的河流又横挡在面前。它一点也不比盘古河好过。他们找到了一只小木排，每次过两人，河里的冰排和木排冲激着，激起了浪花，溅湿了大家的衣服，过河后，每人都成了硬棒棒的冰人。
    本来，作林业工作的，对山岳、林木、河流、风雪是热爱的；但是，现在却处处感到它有意给人折磨和威胁。队员宋恩贵同志，因为有病，爬不上山，渡不过河，抵抗不了寒冷，掉队了，留住在三河站。更多的队员，精神疲惫，脸色发黄，腰酸腿疼，脚下磨出了黑紫黑紫的血泡。在他们的前面还有一千三百里地，像现在这样的速度，再走二十天，也未必能到。问题不在时间的长短，他们没有冬季装备和缺乏粮食。真是困难啊！
    这时，远处传来“嗡—嗡”的飞机响声，大家都惊异地探头了望，一会儿功夫，飞机越过丛林，飞到这个小队伍的头顶上。它盘旋过来，盘旋过去，说什么也不离开他们。“这究竟是怎么回事呢？”大家正在猜测着；突然，它掠过树梢，俯冲下来，把一卷白东西抛下来了。大家捡来拆开一看，原来在腊纸里包着一个纸条，那上面整整齐齐地写着三行俄文字。真可惜，队伍中间谁也不懂俄文。有的猜说：“可能是救我们的。”另一个人不同意：“救我们，不会俄文，谁懂！”另一位又提出质问：“就说苏联飞机来救我们，那他们怎么知道我们在这里？”更多的人认为：“兴许是护林防火的侦察飞机，到我们这里想探听点什么消息。”总之，大家都摸不着头脑。
    奇怪的是，这架飞机仍在队伍的头上盘旋，并且更低了，侧身就看清了驾驶员。辛铁珠拿了那张纸条，向他摇摇手，表示不懂。飞机好像懂得了他的意思，一闪就飞走了。
    第二天，队伍仍继续前进，大家都把昨天发现飞机的事，当成新闻谈。正走着，忽然又有一架飞机抵临了，盘旋一圈后，又投下一件和昨天一样的纸卷。打开一看，上面用中文写着：
    “同志们：
    假如你们需要帮助的时候，请在这里不要动，下午二时至三时，苏联来飞机接你们，你们燃起一堆火作信号，我们好来找你们。”
    当队员们挥手示意的时候，飞机飞走了。此刻，他们是又惊喜，又怀疑。领队辛铁珠问道：“咱们不是作梦吧？”一位同志答称：“你手里拿的不是人家送来的信？”另一个问：“飞机能不能在森林里降落？”有位同志答称：“今天下午三点钟你的‘谜’就破了。”大家津津有味的谈论着。
    终于远方隐约地出现了细微的响声，声音越来越近、越来越大。人们张大了眼睛了望。果然，打江那岸飞来了两架活像蜻蜓似的飞机。他们赶紧点着火，飞机渐渐下落了。
    “这是什么飞机？”
    “这不是我们在苏联画报上看到过的直升飞机吗？”
    飞机慢悠悠地下降。从机仓内走出了四、五个身体魁梧、个子高大的人。一个个子细长的中校军官抢前一步，通过翻译问：
    “你们是森林测量队吗？”
    “是！”
    “像找人参似的可把你们找到了，已经找了你们五天啦，我们是奉莫斯科的命令来找你们的。”中校声如洪钟的说。
      这时，队员们含着激动的热泪一齐奔向苏军中校，拥抱啊！接吻啊！
    苏联同志们都拥向前来慰问他们。“你们辛苦了吧！”“冻坏了吗？”“饿了吗？”大家真像受到哥哥对弟弟那样的体贴和温暖。
    这天，载走了十五个人，第二天早晨，又飞来两架飞机，把留下的十五个人全部载走了。在路上，大家才知道这是苏联政府应中国政府的请求派飞机营救他们的。原来，在北京的林业部了解到黑龙江已经封冻，大兴安岭的森林调查队还有部分队员没有回来，便向苏联政府提出了请求。苏联政府立即答应了这个请求，由阿穆尔州的边防军执行了这个任务。在极恶劣的气候下，找了好几天，终于在森林里发现了他们。
    在这一批人下飞机后，辛铁珠又和苏军少校一块乘飞机去找芦彦允同志那个队，少校同志工作得非常认真、负责和仔细。当他们乘坐的飞机飞临大兴安岭上空的时候，他决定沿着这个队走过的路线，从后边一站一站追过去，因为他估计到这样的坏天气，队员没穿棉衣，一定会有病号拉在后面。一点不错，芦彦允队已经走了七天，每天只走五十里地，已经有三个病号拉在后面，其余同志到十八站时，也都疲乏得走不动了。当飞机降落在他们面前时，他们简直无法用言语来表示感激。最后，这五十一位测量队员，就是这样被苏军从危难中救了出来。苏联同志这种伟大的国际主义精神，人们是永远不会忘怀的。
    当这支队伍分批到达梦格达嘎其镇时，当地党政负责同志对他们非常关心，在生活上给予了充分的照顾，还请他们看了电影。第三天，他们依依不舍地离开了梦格达嘎其镇，乘火车到海兰泡，然后渡江到黑河，由那里返回了哈尔滨。
