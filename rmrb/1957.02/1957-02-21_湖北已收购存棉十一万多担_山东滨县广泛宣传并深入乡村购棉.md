    Hubei Has Acquired Over 110,000 Dan of Stored Cotton
    Bin County, Shandong, Widely Publicizes and Goes Deep into Rural Areas to Purchase Cotton
    (Our Newspaper) Wuhan - Hubei Province, after over fulfilling last year's cotton procurement task, continued to carry out the work of procuring stored cotton. From January 1st to 20th this year, the province has acquired more than 112,300 dan of stored cotton, exceeding the amount of stored cotton acquired in the first half of last year by more than one-third.
    Party and government leaders in many places personally took charge of this work. The Commissioner of the Xiangyang Administrative Office convened a telephone conference of county heads, explaining the national cotton shortage and the significance of farmers selling stored cotton to support national industrial construction; at the same time, they also explained that the acquisition of stored cotton can increase farmers' funds for spring plowing and production. After in-depth investigation, the Xiangyang Administrative Office confirmed that there is still a large amount of stored cotton in rural areas.
    All localities have paid attention to improving procurement methods, changing from purchasing at stores in the past to mobile procurement and sending goods to the countryside for procurement. The procurement departments in Xiangyang County have sent more than 90 cadres deep into the townships since January 17th, and in five days, they have acquired more than 58,700 jin of seed cotton and more than 12,500 jin of ginned cotton. Many farmers who do not have a large amount of stored cotton and cannot spare the time to go to the market to sell are very satisfied with this procurement method.
    Clearing up cotton pre-purchase contracts is also very effective for cotton purchase. Because some agricultural cooperatives were upgraded and merged at the end of last winter, and there was no time to settle the pre-purchase contracts; individual cooperatives misunderstood the open free market under state leadership and wanted to keep cotton to develop indigenous spinning and weaving. After the purchasing staff explained the significance of purchasing stored cotton to them, many farmers sold the cotton in their hands to the state.

    (Our Newspaper) Jinan - The grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Bin County, Shandong Province, are going deep into villages to purchase cotton. Farmers are also actively picking cotton bolls and secondary flowers, and selling stored cotton to the state.
    As of February 6th, Bin County's cotton procurement task had only completed 72% of the annual plan. However, there are still many sources of cotton to purchase. Secondary flowers on cotton stalks can be picked for three to five jin per mu, and up to fifteen jin in many cases; individual farmers generally store hundreds of jin of cotton, and many have thousands of jin; some agricultural cooperatives have not sold all of their cotton to the state. The Tongxin Agricultural Cooperative in Yinji Township stores 50,000 jin of cotton, and some members cannot use all the retained cotton they have been allocated. Based on the above situation, the supply and marketing cooperatives dispatched cadres to mobilize farmers to sell their existing cotton to the state, organize and guide farmers to pick cotton bolls and secondary flowers, and directly go deep into the villages to purchase. The Beizhen Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased a total of 5,400 jin around the Spring Festival, and purchased 710 jin in Mengjia Village alone. The Shangdian Supply and Marketing Cooperative used to purchase only 500 jin per day, but after going deep into the villages for purchase, the daily purchase volume increased to more than 3,000 jin.
    After understanding the significance of selling cotton to the state to support industrial construction, farmers actively picked cotton bolls and secondary flowers, and sold stored cotton to the state. The 63 members of the Laijia Village Agricultural Cooperative in Dudian District sold 700 jin of secondary flowers at one time. The Taiziwang Agricultural Cooperative in Dansi District has sold 3,600 jin of secondary flowers. Members of the Xiaomeijia Village Agricultural Cooperative in Beizhen sold 920 jin of retained cotton saved to the state. Tang Kexuan, an individual farmer in Luchangdian, Shangdian District, sold 713 jin of cotton at one time.
    Issuing excess production preferential food rations has greatly encouraged individual farmers to sell cotton. The 36 individual farmers on Yihe Street in Beizhen sold 14,000 jin of cotton to the state, more than two and a half times the pre-purchase amount.

    湖北已收购存棉十一万多担
    山东滨县广泛宣传并深入乡村购棉
    本报讯　湖北省超额完成去年的棉花收购任务以后，接着又开展了收购存棉工作。从今年1月1日到20日全省已收购了存棉十一万二千三百余担，超过了去年上半年收购存棉数三分之一强。
    许多地方党政负责人都亲自抓紧这个工作。襄阳专署专员召开了县长电话会议，讲明了全国棉花紧张情况和农民出卖存棉对支援国家工业建设的意义；同时也说明了收购存棉，可以增加农民的春耕生产资金。襄阳专署经过深入调查，证实农村中的存棉量仍然很大。
    各地都注意改进收购办法，由过去在门市部收购改为流动收购以及送货下乡收购。襄阳县的收购部门从1月17日起，派九十多个干部深入各乡，五天中收购了籽棉五万八千七百余斤和皮棉一万二千五百余斤。很多存棉数量不多、抽不出时间上街出卖的农民，对这种收购办法非常满意。
    清理棉花预购合同对购棉也很有效果。因为有些农业社去冬升级并社一时还来不及结清预购合同；个别的社由于对开放国家领导下的自由市场有误解，想留棉花发展土纺土织。经采购人员向他们说明收购存棉的意义以后，许多农民都把手上的存棉卖给国家。

    本报讯　山东省滨县各基层供销社正深入到村收购棉花。农民也在积极剥棉桃、摘次花，把存棉卖给国家。
    滨县的棉花收购任务，到2月6日止仅完成年度计划的72％。但是棉花的采购来源还多。棉秸上的次花每亩可摘三、五斤，多的到十五斤；单干农民一般存棉百把斤，多的有千余斤；有的农业社的棉花没有全部卖给国家，尹集乡同心农业社就存棉花五万斤，有的社员分到的自留棉也用不了。根据上面的情况，各供销社派出干部，一面动员农民把现存棉花卖给国家，组织和指导农民剥棉桃、摘次花；一面直接深入到村收购。北镇供销社春节前后共收购五千四百斤，在孟家村一次就收购七百一十斤。尚店供销社过去每天只收购五百斤，深入到村收购以后，每天收购量增加到三千斤以上。
    农民了解卖棉花给国家支援工业建设的意义以后，积极地剥棉桃、摘次花，并把存棉卖给国家。杜店区来家村农业社的六十三户社员，一次卖次花七百斤。单寺区台子王农业社，已卖出次花三千六百斤。北镇小梅家村农业社社员，把节约下来的自留棉九百二十斤卖给了国家。尚店区卤场店单干农民唐克宣，一次卖棉七百一十三斤。
    发放超产优待粮，对鼓舞单干农民卖棉作用很大。北镇义和街的三十六户单干农民，卖给国家棉花一万四千斤，超过预购数两倍半。
