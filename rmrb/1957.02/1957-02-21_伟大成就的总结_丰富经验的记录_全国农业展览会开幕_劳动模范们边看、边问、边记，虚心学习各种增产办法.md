Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The National Agricultural Exhibition held a grand opening ceremony at 3 p.m. today in the square in front of the "Soviet Exhibition Hall" in the western suburbs of the capital.

Those attending the opening ceremony included Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui, ministers and vice-ministers of various ministries, heads of various people's organizations, heads of the Beijing Municipal Party and Government, ambassadors of various countries to China, experts from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European fraternal countries working in China in the fields of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology, all representatives attending the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Models, and visiting delegations from Shanxi, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and other provinces (regions), totaling about 3,000 people.

Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan delivered the opening speech. He said: The National Agricultural Exhibition summarizes the great achievements made in China's socialist transformation of agriculture and in the production and construction of agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, aquaculture, and meteorology, introduces the rich production experience accumulated by Chinese farmers in their long-term production labor practices, and introduces the promotion and application of advanced scientific achievements. It also reflects the improvement of the living standards of the Chinese people. This will greatly encourage and promote farmers across the country to actively strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1957 and to strive to realize the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967. He also said: We must use this exhibition to exchange experience in increasing production. He expressed his welcome and gratitude to the foreign guests for participating in the opening ceremony and asked for their criticism and guidance.

Subsequently, Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui cut the ribbon. When the ribbon across the entrance of the exhibition hall was cut, Vice Premier Deng and the ministers accompanied the foreign guests, agricultural labor models, etc., into the hall under the guidance of Director-General of the Exhibition Jin Shanbao.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th. A collective report by Xinhua News Agency reporters: This afternoon, the huge vermilion gate of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall opened to welcome the first group of visitors after the opening. Jin Shanbao, Director-General of the National Agricultural Exhibition, accompanied Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui, heads of central ministries and people's organizations, and foreign friends into the exhibition hall. Following behind were experts from the agricultural production front from all over the country—representatives attending the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Models, as well as many provincial and municipal visiting delegations.

The more than 2,000 exhibits and nearly 5,000 specimens, models, machines, instruments, etc., displayed in the eleven pavilions of the exhibition present a magnificent picture to the people.

Foreign guests entered the Comprehensive Hall. The large and small models and books displayed on both sides of the entrance, showing China's superior natural conditions and the history of ancient agricultural production struggles, attracted the attention of the audience. Many foreign friends stopped here, recording this glorious page of Chinese people's history in their notebooks.

Vice Premier Deng, in high spirits, also continuously explained to the guests, pointing out to them the large pictures illustrating the land reform and cooperative movement, and the models illustrating the twelve-year long-range plan. When the guests reached the machinery room of the Increased Production Measures Hall, they stopped in front of a rice transplanter initially trial-produced in China and asked the commentator for a detailed explanation. This is an animal-powered transplanter that can transplant 30 mu of rice seedlings per day, replacing heavy manual labor. The commentator explained the structure of each part of the machine and especially turned the part that replaces human hands in transplanting, explaining how the seedlings can be evenly taken out of the placement box and inserted into the mud.

The guests were very interested in the many varieties of rice in China. They looked in detail at deep-water rice, purple rice from Yunnan, and multi-grain rice that can yield three or four grains of rice from one grain. Many people were curious and personally peeled a few grains. They also looked at China's diverse tropical crops and cash crops in turn. When Indian guests saw wild hemp produced in Xinjiang and fabrics woven from wild hemp fiber, they asked: Are there any exports now?

At this time, the right side of the Comprehensive Hall appeared particularly crowded. It turned out that Wang Yukun, one of the three poor farmers from Nanwangzhuang, Anping County, Hebei Province, praised by Chairman Mao as the "direction of 500 million people," who persisted in taking the path of collectivization, was telling people about the tortuous process of setting up his cooperative. He pointed to a person writing on a picture and said: This is the situation when the middle peasant who had previously withdrawn from the cooperative signed to "return to his old home" (i.e., join the cooperative). In the photo of the celebration meeting for the first anniversary of the establishment of this cooperative, an old man with a smiling face was sitting in the right corner in front of the stage. Wang Yukun said: This is a middle peasant who used to often satirize their poor cooperative. After joining the cooperative, because of his rich production experience, he was respected by the members, his enthusiasm for production increased, and he has now been elected as the captain of the production team.

Wang Shulan, one of the three Lans (Wang Shulan, Wang Rulan, Wang Huilan) of the Bohai Agricultural Cooperative in Hebei Province, which is famous throughout the country, was very interested in every experience of increasing rice production. She used clumsy strokes to record the high-yield figures of typical agricultural cooperatives in Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, and other places, and also recorded the important measures each cooperative took to achieve increased production. She said: "With these good methods from others, coupled with our own efforts, a bumper harvest is promising." Jin Xuexian, another female labor model representative from Hebei Province and director of the "Hundred Refinements Become Steel Agricultural Cooperative," was also sweating profusely, copying the experience of increasing peanut production in the Grain Hall.

Li Shunda, Qu Yaoli, and Guo Yu'en, representatives from Shanxi Province attending the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Models, entered the Crop Hall to carefully observe various grain varieties. They believed that Bai Ma Ya corn and some high-yielding wheat seeds were the best, and asked the commentators about the yield and origin of these varieties, preparing to introduce them for trial planting in the future. Qu Yaoli spoke highly of the Dai Zi No. 15 cotton seeds. Last year, the agricultural cooperative he was in had already begun to promote it, and this year it will be almost universal. The commentator conveyed to him the audience's request that he personally introduce new cotton planting experiences. Qu Yaoli agreed to find another time to meet with everyone and talk in detail. Qu Yaoli also lingered for a long time in front of the exhibits sent by his own agricultural cooperative, pointing at the cotton plant specimens and giving a brief introduction to the audience present. Photography reporters immediately captured this vivid scene on camera.

In the Increased Production Measures Hall, labor models from all over Hubei paid special attention to the experience of expanding multiple cropping, increasing fertilizer application, improving soil, cultivating seeds, and preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. They looked at many charts and models again and again, recorded them again and again, for fear of missing anything. Labor model Cai Yitian read word by word the perennial fertilizer accumulation experience of "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" (the four diligences are: diligent sweeping, diligent padding, diligent output, diligent burning; the eight possessions are: cattle have pens, pigs have sties, fields have seedlings—green manure, ponds in all seasons, manure has pools, ash has houses, people have toilets, chickens and ducks have nests) in Liling County, Hunan Province. He said, in the past, we only paid attention to accumulating fertilizer in the cooperative, and did not mobilize the family members of the cooperative to accumulate fertilizer. We must fill this big loophole when we go back. Rao Xingli, director of the "October" Agricultural Cooperative in Xishui County, who led the entire cooperative to increase production across the board last year, said that after seeing the soil improvement situation in Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, he also expressed that he would mobilize cooperative members to carry out soil improvement and eliminate low-yield fields when he went back.

The temporary bookstore selling exhibition materials set up at the exhibition was very crowded with customers today. When people saw the most interesting experience at the exhibition, they came here to select relevant books to take back for research. A visitor from Jiangxi bought more than one hundred books at once.

    伟大成就的总结　丰富经验的记录
    全国农业展览会开幕
    劳动模范们边看、边问、边记，虚心学习各种增产办法
    新华社20日讯　全国农业展览会今天下午三时在首都西郊“苏联展览馆”前的广场上举行了隆重的开幕式。
    参加开幕式的有国务院副总理邓子恢、各部部长和副部长、各人民团体的负责人、北京市党和政府的负责人、各国驻我国的使节、在我国工作的有关农、林、水利、气象等方面的苏联和东欧各兄弟国家的专家、参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议的全体代表，和山西、河南、内蒙古、西藏等省（区）前来参观的参观团共三千人左右。
    农业部部长廖鲁言致开幕词。他说：全国农业展览会总结了我国农业社会主义改造和农业、林业、水利、水产和气象各方面的生产建设所取得的伟大成就，介绍了中国农民在长久的生产劳动实践中所积累起来的丰富的生产经验，介绍了先进科学成就的推广和应用。它也反映了中国人民生活水平的提高。这将大大地鼓励和推动全国农民，积极为争取1957年农业生产的大丰收而奋斗，为实现1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）而奋斗。他还说：我们要利用这次展览会来交流增产的经验。他对各国外宾参加开幕式表示欢迎和谢意，并要求给予批评和指导。
    接着，国务院副总理邓子恢剪彩。当横在展览馆门前的彩绳剪断时，邓副总理、各部部长即陪同各国外宾、农业劳动模范等，在总馆长金善宝引导下入馆参观。
    新华社20日讯　新华社记者集体报道：今天下午，全国农业展览会展览馆的巨大的朱漆大门打开来，迎接了开幕后的第一批观众。全国农业展览会总馆长金善宝陪同国务院副总理邓子恢、中央各部、各人民团体负责人和外国友人走进了展览馆大门，随在后面的是来自各地的农业生产战线上的能手——全国农业劳动模范代表会议的代表们，以及许多省市参观团人员。
    展览会十一个馆展出的二千多种实物和近五千件实物标本、模型、机器、仪器等，在人们面前展示出一幅壮丽的图画。
    外宾们走进了综合馆，设在门两边的显示我国优越的自然条件和我国古代农业生产斗争史的大小模型和书籍，吸引了观众的注意。许多外国友人停留在这里，他们在笔记本上记下了中国人民这一页光荣的历史。
    兴致勃勃的邓副总理也不断地向客人们作了讲解，他指给客人看那些说明土地改革和合作化运动的大幅图片，看说明十二年远景规划的模型。当客人们走到增产措施馆的机械室，他们在一部我国初步试制的水稻插秧机前面停下来了，要求讲解员作详细的说明。这是一部畜力插秧机，每天可以插秧三十亩，代替了繁重的人力劳动。讲解员讲了机器的各部的构造，还特别转动代替人手插秧的部分讲了秧苗怎样能够均匀地从放置箱中取出并插到泥里的道理。
    客人们对我国水稻品种很多很感兴趣，他们详细地看了深水稻，云南的紫稻和一粒谷中可以剥出三、四粒米来的多粒稻。许多人还好奇地亲自剥了几粒。他们又挨次看了我国多种多样的热带作物和经济作物。印度客人看到新疆所产的野麻，看到野麻纤维织成的织物，还问：现在有出口的吗？
    这时，综合馆的右侧显得格外拥挤起来。原来是被毛主席称作“五亿人民的方向”的河北省安平县南王庄坚持走合作化道路的三户贫农之一的王玉坤，正在向人们述说自己办社的曲折过程。他指着图片上一个正在写字的人说：这就是原先退社的中农在签字“回老家”（即入社）的情形。在这个社建社一周年的纪念大会的照片上，台前右角坐着一位满脸笑容的老汉，王玉坤说：这就是从前经常讽刺他们穷棒子社的一个中农社员。入社后由于他的生产经验丰富，受到社员的尊敬，他的生产积极性高了，现在已经被选为生产队的队长了。
    闻名全国的河北省渤海农业社的三兰（王淑兰、王如兰、王惠兰）之一王淑兰，对水稻增产的每一项经验都感到很大兴趣，她用不熟练的笔画记下了云南、贵州、福建等地典型农业社的高额产量数字，还记下了每个社获得增产的重要措施，她说：“有了别人这些好办法，再加上自己的努力，丰收就有指望了。”河北省的另一位女劳动模范代表、“百炼成钢农业社”主任晋学贤在粮食馆抄写花生增产经验也累得满头大汗。
    出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的山西省代表李顺达、曲耀离和郭玉恩等走进了农作物馆仔细参观各种粮食品种。他们认为白马牙玉米和一些高产小麦种籽最好，并向讲解员问了这些品种的产量和产地，准备以后引种试验。曲耀离对岱字十五号棉种评价很高。去年他所在的农业社已开始推广，今年就差不多普及了。讲解员向他转达了观众们要求他亲自介绍新的植棉经验的意见，曲耀离答应另找时间和大家见面详细谈谈。曲耀离还在他自己的农业社送来的展品面前停留很久，指点着棉株标本，向在场的观众作了简要介绍。摄影记者们立刻把这个生动场面摄入镜头。
    在增产措施馆里，来自湖北各地的劳动模范们，对扩大复种、增施肥料、改良土壤、培育种籽以及防治病虫害的经验，特别注意。他们在许多图表、模型的跟前看了又看，记了又记，生怕漏掉什么。劳动模范蔡以田一字一字地念完湖南省醴陵县“四勤八有”（四勤是：勤扫、勤垫、勤出、勤烧；八有是：牛有栏、猪有圈、田有草子——绿肥、四季有凼、粪有池、灰有屋、人有厕所、鸡鸭有窝）的常年积肥经验。他说，我们过去只注意社里积肥，没发动社员家庭积肥，这个大漏洞，回去一定把它填上。去年领导全社全面增产的浠水县“十月”农业社主任饶兴礼，看了山东、河南等省改良土壤的情况以后，他也表示回去要发动社员进行土壤改良，消灭低产田。
    设在展览会上的展览资料临时售书处，今天顾客非常拥挤。人们在展览会上看到最感兴趣的经验时，就到这里选购有关的书本带回去研究。江西省的一位参观者一次就买了一百多本。
