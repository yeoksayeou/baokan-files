    Strive to Produce Seven Million Tons of Salt

    Salt is a necessity for people's lives, an important raw material for basic chemical industries and aquatic product processing, an important feed for livestock, and an important material for foreign trade. However, in recent years, China's salt industry has been severely affected by natural disasters such as rain, typhoons, and floods, resulting in failure to meet production targets. This year, the state requires the production of seven million tons of salt, an increase of 2.1 million tons over last year's actual output. We hope that the employees of the salt industry will do everything possible, while ensuring quality, to strive to complete and over fulfill this year's production plan.

    Completing the production task of seven million tons of salt mainly relies on coastal salt fields. This is because coastal salt fields account for more than 85% of the country's total output each year, and their production costs are low and transportation is convenient. If these salt fields complete their plans, they can not only meet the needs of most of China's edible salt and all industrial salt and export salt, but also save a lot of transportation capacity and freight. Therefore, coastal salt areas with good weather this year must make the greatest efforts to over fulfill the production plan, the more the better; coastal salt areas with normal weather should ensure the completion and strive to over fulfill the state plan; coastal salt areas with bad weather should also try to minimize the impact of natural disasters and strive to complete the state plan.

    As for China's rock salt and well salt, their production is not greatly affected by the climate. As long as we strengthen the leadership of production, do a good job in equipment maintenance, improve equipment utilization, and reduce accidents, there is no problem in completing the state plan. They should also vigorously save raw materials and fuel, reduce costs, and improve quality. Although lake salt is abundant and easy to produce, it is located in areas with inconvenient transportation. The products are mainly supplied for consumption by the people in the region. If they are to be transported to distant places, the freight often exceeds the production cost by eight or even ten times, and it occupies the country's transportation tools for a long time, which is economically very uneconomical. Therefore, they can only appropriately increase production under the principle of regional production and sales balance.

    The main way to increase the production of sea salt is to increase the yield per unit area of salt fields and increase labor productivity. Among the existing sea salt fields, state-owned salt fields account for more than 80% of the output. State-owned salt fields have a relatively high degree of mechanization, and therefore labor productivity is also relatively high. However, their yield per unit area is much lower than that of advanced cooperative salt fields in the same area. Within the same state-owned salt field, it is also common for the yield per unit area of advanced work areas to be 10% to 30% higher than that of backward work areas, and for advanced groups to be higher than backward groups. Therefore, if the yield per unit area of relatively backward salt fields, work areas, and groups is raised to the level of advanced units, it is entirely possible to over fulfill this year's production tasks.

    Why is the yield per unit area of advanced cooperative salt fields and advanced work areas and groups in state-owned salt fields higher? This is mainly because more labor is spent on each hectare of production area, the salt pan is repaired flat and solid, accelerating the evaporation of seawater, reducing the loss of brine, doing a good job in crystallization management, and making full use of the severe cold freezing climate before spring sunning to carry out winter brine cultivation, and making full use of every sunny day during the production period for production. We hope that the administrative leading departments and trade union organizations at all levels of the salt industry will summarize and promote these experiences, so that the vast number of salt workers will strive to master and apply these experiences, and fight for higher output.

    Sea salt production is open-air operation and is greatly affected by the climate. In the past, many cadres and workers had the idea of "relying on the heavens for food." They always thought that April, May, and June north of the Huai River were the peak production season, and July and August were the rainy season when production was impossible. If the rainy season came early, they would think that the weather was not favorable and there was no hope of completing the task; even if it did not rain in July and August, they would treat it as an off-season and not work hard to produce. They do not understand that the law of climate change is not the same every year and in every region. In some years, the rainy season comes early in some areas, and May and June may be the rainy season, and it may not rain in July and August; in some years, the rainy season comes late in some areas, and it may still not rain in July and August. There is also a difference between concentrated and dispersed rainfall during the rainy season. A rainy season with concentrated rainfall lasts for a short time, and a rainy season with dispersed rainfall lasts for a long time. We should determine which months are the peak production season and which months are the off-season according to the changes in the rainy season; we should not invariably call April, May, and June the peak season, and July and August the off-season. In Liaoning Province, no salt was produced in August in the past, but in August 1955, all salt fields arranged production tasks according to the situation of no rain, and as a result, 180,000 tons of salt were produced, accounting for about 20% of the total annual output. This shows that it is very important to correctly grasp the changes in the peak and off-seasons. Even in the rainy season, it does not rain every day. Often, it rains for a few consecutive days and then clears for a few consecutive days. Therefore, we should overcome the negative idea of "relying on the heavens for food," make full use of the good weather during the rainy season, do a good job in discharging fresh water, preserving brine, and ensuring the safety of salt fields, and strive to produce more salt.

    In order to enable salt industry workers to accurately grasp the changes in the weather so as to make full use of sunny days, it is hoped that coastal meteorological observatories (stations) will strengthen their connection with the central meteorological observatory to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts. In areas with suitable conditions, small meteorological observatories can also be established with emphasis to be specifically responsible for weather forecasts in salt areas. Salt production units should also make full use of the weather observation experience of veteran workers, combine scientific weather forecasts with the practical experience of the masses, and guide production.

    In the past few years, the relevant local party committees and people's committees have generally attached importance to the leadership and supervision of salt production. However, some local party committees and people's committees are still not concerned enough about salt production. In these places, difficulties in salt production and workers' lives are not helped and resolved; cadres of local salt farms and cooperative salt farms are often temporarily transferred to do other work. In order to ensure the completion of this year's salt production plan, it is hoped that the relevant local party committees and people's committees will further strengthen the leadership and supervision of salt production, and urge supply and marketing cooperatives and other units to actively help salt farms do a good job in supplying the labor force, tools, electricity, fuel, grain, and non-staple food needed for production. The management cadres and technical personnel of salt farms should be transferred as little as possible. Cadres who are lacking in salt farms should be transferred to improve the production management level of salt farms. Local party committees should also often care about the political and ideological work of workers in salt areas, care about the workers' living welfare, so that they can always maintain enthusiasm for production.

### 努力生产七百万吨盐

    努力生产七百万吨盐
    盐是人民生活必需品，是基本化学工业、水产加工业的重要原料，是牲畜的重要饲料，也是对外贸易的重要物资。但是，近年来我国制盐工业却受到多雨、台风、洪水等自然灾害的严重影响，以致没有完成产量计划。今年国家要求生产七百万吨盐，比去年实际产量多二百一十万吨。我们希望制盐工业的职工们，想尽一切办法，在保证质量的前提下，争取完成和超额完成今年的生产计划。     完成七百万吨盐的生产任务，主要依靠沿海的盐场。因为沿海盐场每年的产量占全国总产量的85％以上，而且生产成本低廉，交通便利。这些盐场完成了计划，不只可以满足我国绝大部分食盐和全部工业用盐以及出口用盐的需要，并且还可以节约很多运输力量和运费。因此，今年气候好的海盐区，必须尽最大的努力来超额完成生产计划，超额越多越好；气候正常的海盐区，要保证完成并力争超额完成国家计划；气候不好的海盐区，也要尽量缩小自然灾害的影响，争取完成国家计划。
    至于我国的矿盐、井盐等生产受气候的影响不大，只要加强对生产的领导，做好设备的检修工作，提高设备利用率，减少事故，完成国家计划是没有问题的；它们还应该大力节约原材料和燃料，降低成本，提高质量。池盐虽然蕴藏丰富，生产便利，但是，它们处在交通不便的地区，产品主要是供给本地区的人民食用；它们如果要运到远地去，那末，运费往往要超过生产成本的八倍甚至十倍，并且长期占用国家的运输工具，经济上很不合算。所以，它们只能在地区产销平衡的原则下，适当地增产。
    增产海盐的主要途径是提高盐场的单位面积产量，提高劳动生产率。在现有的海盐盐场中，国营盐场的产量占80％以上。国营盐场的机械化程度比较高，因而劳动生产率也比较高。但是，它们的单位面积产量，比同一地区先进的合作社的盐场要低很多。在同一国营盐场内，先进工区比落后工区、先进小组比落后小组的单位面积产量高10％到30％的情形也很普遍。因此，如果把比较落后的盐场、工区和小组的单位面积产量提高到先进单位的水平，就完全有可能超额完成今年的生产任务。
    先进的合作社的盐场和国营盐场中先进工区和小组的单位面积产量为什么会提高呢？这主要是因为每一公顷生产面积上花的人工比较多，盐滩修得平而实，加速海水的蒸发，减少卤水的损耗，做好结晶管理，以及充分利用春晒前严寒结冻的气候开展冬季养卤工作，充分利用生产期间的每一个晴天进行生产。我们希望制盐工业的各级行政领导部门和工会组织，总结和推广这些经验，使广大的制盐职工努力掌握和运用这些经验，为争取更高的产量而斗争。
    海盐生产是露天作业，受气候的影响比较大。过去不少干部和工人有“靠天吃饭”的思想。他们总以为淮河以北四、五、六月是生产旺季，七、八月是不能生产的雨季。要是雨季提前了，他们便认为天公不作美，完成任务没有了希望；即使七、八月份不下雨，也当作是淡季，不努力生产。他们不了解这种气候变化的规律，并非每一年、每一个地区都一样。有的年份有的地区雨季来得早，可能五、六月就是雨季，七、八月并不下雨；有的年份有的地区雨季来得晚，可能七、八月仍不下雨。雨季的降雨量也有集中和分散的区别。雨量集中的雨季历时较短，雨量分散的雨季历时较长。我们应该根据雨季的变化来确定哪些月份是生产旺季，哪些月份是淡季；而不应该一成不变地把四、五、六月叫做旺季，把七、八月叫做淡季。在辽宁省，过去每年8月份都不产盐，但是，1955年的8月份，各盐场都按照不下雨的情况布置生产任务，结果生产了十八万吨盐，占全年总产量的20％左右。这说明正确掌握旺季淡季的变化是非常重要的。就是在雨季，也不是天天都下雨，往往是连下几天雨就连晴几天。因此，应该克服“靠天吃饭”的消极思想，充分利用雨季中的好天气，做好排除淡水、保全卤水和盐场的安全工作，努力增产更多的盐。
    为了使盐业职工能够准确地掌握气象的变化，以便充分地利用晴天，希望各沿海气象台（站）加强同中心气象台的联系，提高气象预报的准确率。在有条件的地区，还可以有重点地建立小型气象台，专门负责盐区的气象预报工作。盐业生产单位也应该充分运用老工人的观天经验，把科学的气象预报和群众的实践经验结合起来，指导生产。
    过去几年，有关的地方党委和人民委员会，一般是重视对盐业生产的领导和监督的。不过，有些地方党委和人民委员会对盐业生产仍然不够关心。在这些地方，盐业生产和职工生活上有了困难，得不到帮助和解决；地方盐场、合作社盐场的干部经常被临时调去做其他工作。为了保证今年盐业生产计划的完成，希望有关的地方党委和人民委员会，进一步加强对盐业生产的领导和监督，并督促供销合作社等单位，积极地帮助盐场做好生产所需要的劳动力、工具、电力、燃料、粮食和副食品的供应工作。盐场的管理干部和技术人员，要尽可能地不调动或少调动。盐场所缺少的干部，要设法调配，以便提高盐场的生产管理水平。地方党委还要经常关心盐区职工的政治思想工作，关心职工的生活福利，使他们能够经常保持生产的热情。
