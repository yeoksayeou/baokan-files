    Remembering the Darkness Before Dawn
    Zhuang Qun
    It's February 28th again. Ten years ago today, the Chongqing Xinhua Daily was forced to cease publication. I was a car driver for the newspaper at the time, and I still vividly remember the "lesson" the enemy taught our newspaper comrades.

    From February 19th to 23rd, 1947, our army annihilated more than 60,000 of the enemy's elite troops in the Laiwu area of Shandong, and captured the enemy's deputy commander alive. When the good news came, people were infinitely happy and excited. The newspaper's trade union decided to hold a celebration on February 28th, and the mess hall also planned to have a special meal that day. After finishing printing the newspaper on the 27th, the comrades, regardless of the fatigue of working all night, immediately threw themselves into the preparations for the celebration, and didn't disperse until one o'clock at night. When I returned to my room, I vaguely heard dogs barking in the distance, but I didn't pay attention. Unexpectedly, I was sound asleep when a comrade woke me up. He whispered to me to quickly take the newspaper's manager to the Provincial Party Committee in Zengjiayan. I sat up quickly and turned on the light, but the light didn't come on, because the power had been cut off by the enemy. At this time, the sound of dogs barking, ten-wheel trucks, and commands on the hills around the newspaper building were interwoven, and the smell of burning paper was rising from downstairs, obviously indicating a serious situation. Walking into the office, manager Yu Gang and deputy manager Liu Zhan were leaning over a candle, discussing something. They told me that the enemy had completely surrounded the newspaper building and had sent an "ultimatum" demanding that we evacuate Chongqing immediately. Therefore, it was necessary to go to the Provincial Party Committee overnight.

    At the end of February, the pre-dawn climate in Chongqing was still very cold. We casually threw on cotton overcoats, grabbed flashlights, and walked out of the gate. It was very dark outside. The three of us walked silently across the small stone bridge, climbed up the hillside, and a machine gun cocking sound and a shout came from the darkness ahead: "Password?" I took the "ultimatum" and climbed over the hillside first, wanting to explain our intentions. A group of enemy soldiers darted out of the bushes, and without saying a word, like wolves and tigers, they押 (yā -押 means to pawn, detain, or check) me into their position. I couldn't help but laugh. Look! They mobilized so many people and weapons against us revolutionary journalists who were unarmed, and they were fully equipped in both military and civilian aspects: countless armed enemy soldiers were mixed with a large number of plainclothes agents. The enemy soldiers were all lying down in the trenches, with their rifles loaded with ammunition and bayonets, and mortars, machine guns, and grenade launchers were everywhere... We were searched, and then comrades Yu and Liu negotiated with them. The enemy not only refused to let us pass but also ordered us to accompany them into the newspaper building, and even asked the manager to guarantee that the comrades in the building would not "shoot" at them. What a ridiculous scene: they bent over, held their guns, and hid tightly behind us as they "rushed" into the newspaper building, as if every pen in the newspaper building was a gun loaded with live ammunition!

    The exhausted comrades were all taken to the playground in their sleep, forbidden to wear glasses or outerwear, and the children hugged their mothers' legs and shivered with cold. After the enemy gathered us together, they set up machine guns all around. Then the enemy divided their forces and advanced side by side: on one side, a secret service chief was "lecturing" us on the playground, calling us "comrades," "friends," and "gentlemen" in a chaotic manner. Looking at his grinning, sinister face, his small snake eyes, and listening to his sharp voice, talking hypocritically, we were burning with anger, and we didn't even feel the cold wind biting. At the same time, the enemy was ransacking our dormitories with ferocity, looting valuable clothes, even the glasses on the tables, and devouring most of the fried fish and braised pork that we were going to eat for the celebration in the kitchen. When we returned to our dormitories, the military and civilian enemies were arguing and fighting because of the uneven distribution of the spoils. As for "weapons," they searched every corner, but besides a few kitchen knives, they couldn't find anything that could be called a weapon. They couldn't help but be surprised and asked us, "What do you rely on to survive without weapons?" We replied, "We rely on the enthusiastic support of our compatriots across the country!"

    We were detained in batches in houses, living a concentration camp life.

    We were angry, but at the same time, we were calm. We often leaned against the windows and raised our heads to sing loudly, passionately and generously, and the enemy could do nothing. Once, one of our comrades, taking advantage of the opportunity to accompany the enemy to inventory the newspaper's assets, cleverly ran to the printing press and manually printed more than twenty copies of the last day's newspaper. This day's newspaper reprinted an important editorial from the Yan'an Liberation Daily, "Peeling Off Another Layer of Skin," but unfortunately, it didn't have time to meet the vast number of readers in the White Area.

    On March 7th, the enemy finally "released" us,押 (yā -押 means to pawn, detain, or check) us to the airport, and we boarded the plane to Yan'an...

    Today, ten years later, recalling this scene before dawn, I deeply feel the irresistibility of the train of the times!

    忆黎明前的黑暗
    庄群
    又到2月28日了。十年前的今天，重庆新华日报被迫停刊。我当时是报馆的汽车司机，对于敌人给我们报馆同志上的一“课”，至今记忆犹新。
    1947年2月19日到23日，我军在山东莱芜地区歼灭敌人精锐部队六万多人，并且生俘敌军副司令长官。喜讯传来，人们无限欢欣振奋。报馆的工会决定在2月28日举行一个庆祝会，伙食团也准备在这天会餐。27日印完报纸后，同志们不顾通夜工作的劳累，又都立即投入了庆祝会的筹备工作，一直忙到夜一时才散。我回寝室时，隐约听见远处连声狗叫，没有在意。不料正睡得熟时，被一位同志推醒。他轻声叫我赶快送报馆经理到曾家岩省委去一趟。我一骨碌坐起开电灯，灯没亮，原来电源已被敌人切断了。这时报馆四周山坡上狗叫声、十轮卡车声、口令声织成一片，楼下冒上来烧毁纸张的烟味，显然事态严重了。走进办公室，经理于刚同志正和副经理刘瞻同志俯身在烛下商量着什么。他们告诉我：敌人已将报馆团团包围，并且送来了“最后通牒”，要我们立即撤离重庆。为此，必须连夜到省委去一趟。
    二月末梢的重庆黎明前的气候，寒意尚浓。我们顺手披了件棉大衣，拿着手电筒，就走出了大门。外面很黑。三人默默地走过小石桥，爬上山坡，对面黑暗中传来机枪扳动声和?喝声：“口令”？我拿着那“最后通牒”，先爬过山坡去，想说明来意。小树丛里窜出一群敌兵，不由分说，如狼如虎般把我押进了他们的阵地。我忍不住好笑。瞧！他们对着我们手无寸铁的革命新闻工作者竟出动了如此众多的人马武器，而且文武齐全：无数武装敌兵里面还夹着大批便衣特务。敌兵一个个卧倒在战壕里，手里的步枪装上了弹药和刺刀，迫击炮、机枪、掷弹筒满布着……。我们被搜过身，随后于、刘两同志同他们谈判。敌人不但不准我们通过，反而命令我们陪他们进报馆去，还要求经理保证馆内同志不向他们“射击”。这是多么可笑的一幕呀：他们弯着腰，端着枪，紧紧躲在我们身后“冲”进了报馆，好像报馆里的每一支笔都是实弹的枪！
    累极了的同志们都在睡梦中被押上了球场，不准带眼镜，不准穿外衣，孩子们抱着妈妈的腿冻得直发抖。敌人把我们集齐后，四周架上了机枪。于是敌人分兵齐头并进：一面是在球场上，由一个特务头子向我们“训话”，什么“同志们”“朋友们”“先生们”地乱叫一通。看着他那奸笑的狰狞面孔，细小的蛇眼，听着他那尖利的嗓音，假惺惺地扯谈，我们怒火中烧，反倒不觉得冷风刺骨了。同时敌人正在我们寝室里穷凶极恶地翻箱倒柜，把贵重衣物，甚至桌上的眼镜，都掳掠一空，还把伙房里我们会餐吃的炸鱼、酱肉吞吃了大半。我们回寝室时，文武两帮敌人因为分赃不均，正在争吵厮打。至于“武器”，他们搜遍了每个角落，除了伙房里几把切菜刀外，实在找不出任何一件可以称作武器的东西。他们忍不住惊讶，问我们“没武器靠什么生存？”我们回答：“靠全国同胞的热烈支持！”
    我们分批被拘禁在屋子里，过着集中营的生活。
    我们是愤怒的，但同时是镇静的。我们常常倚窗昂首高歌，激昂慷慨，敌人无可奈何。有一次，我们的一个同志，还乘着陪敌人清点报馆物资的机会，机警地跑到印刷机旁，用手摇出了二十多份最后一天的报纸。这天的报上转载了延安解放日报的重要社论“再剥一层皮”，可惜没有来得及同白区广大读者见面。
    到3月7日，敌人终于“释放”我们了，把我们押到机场，我们进入飞往延安的飞机……。
    在十年后的今天，回忆这黎明前的一幕，我是多么深切地感觉到时代列车的不可抗拒！
