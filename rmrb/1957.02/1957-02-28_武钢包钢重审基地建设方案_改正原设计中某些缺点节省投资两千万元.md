Wuhan Steel and Baotou Steel Re-examine Base Construction Plans
Correcting Some Defects in Original Design and Saving 20 Million Yuan in Investment

(Our dispatch) The Metallurgical Industry Ministry’s Construction Bureau, relevant construction enterprises involved in the construction of Wuhan Steel and Baotou Steel, and the Black Metallurgy Design Institute, etc., recently re-examined the construction plans for the construction bases in these two regions, based on the central government’s spirit of streamlining and thrift, and the actual needs in the construction of Wuhan Steel and Baotou Steel. Preliminary calculations indicate that the investment in the expansion project of the Wuhan Steel construction base can be reduced by about one-half, saving more than three million yuan; the Baotou Steel construction base project can reduce investment by about seventeen million yuan.

The basic construction base in Wuhan officially started construction in October 1955, and most of the enterprises had been put into production successively by 1956. The construction policy at that time was to supply building materials and semi-finished products for the first phase of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company. After a new upsurge of socialist construction was launched across the country in the first half of 1956, the first and second phases of the Wuhan Steel project were prepared to be merged. With the approval of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, an additional investment of six million yuan was made to expand the Wuhan construction base. This year, in order to use funds rationally, the state re-adjusted the various national construction plans. The Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry re-examined the expansion of the Wuhan base in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. It was believed that the existing production enterprises of the Wuhan base could basically meet the needs of Wuhan Steel construction in terms of production scale and service life. It was only necessary to take some necessary technical measures in production and correct some shortcomings in the original planning and design, in order to further tap the production potential, and it was not necessary to carry out large-scale expansion. For example, the originally planned new second concrete mixing plant, the timber joint processing plant's sawing workshop, the asphalt processing plant, the paint glass workshop, and the central laboratory, etc., could be discontinued. It was only necessary to set up temporary facilities at the construction site to meet the construction needs. The originally decided expansion of the steel bar processing plant, the mechanized supply station, and the automobile base, etc., would remain at their original scale. According to the new plan, the investment in the Wuhan base could be reduced from more than six million yuan to about three million yuan, saving the country half of the investment.

The original design of the Baotou construction base had the problems of excessive scale and excessively high standards, resulting in waste. After the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry revised the design plan of the Wuhan construction base, it then re-examined the design of the Baotou construction base.

The original design of the Baotou construction base stipulated fourteen auxiliary and supporting enterprises and other facilities, such as concrete and mortar mixing plants, building material grinding plants, prefabrication plants, timber joint processing plants, steel bar processing plants, foamed concrete plants, and mechanized supply stations. After preliminary research, the designed annual production capacity of some enterprises, such as concrete mixing plants, building material grinding plants, and automobile bases, could be reduced by about half; the mechanized supply station could be merged with the construction machinery repair plant; and the construction standards of these enterprises were also reasonably lowered. In this way, the base investment is estimated to be reduced by about five million yuan. In order to ensure the supply of sand and stone for the construction of Baotou Steel, it was originally planned to build its own quarry and sand quarry. After discussions with relevant parties in Baotou City, the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry only needs to invest a small amount of capital in Baotou City in the next two years and provide technical support, and the sand and stone required for the construction of Baotou Steel can be completely supplied by Baotou City. In this way, another 12 million yuan or so can be saved in investment.

### 武钢包钢重审基地建设方案  改正原设计中某些缺点节省投资两千万元

    武钢包钢重审基地建设方案
    改正原设计中某些缺点节省投资两千万元
    本报讯　冶金工业部建筑局和建设武钢、包钢的有关建筑企业及黑色冶金设计院等单位，最近根据中央精简节约的精神和武钢、包钢建设中的实际需要，对这两个地区的建筑基地的建设方案重新作了研究，初步计算，武钢建筑基地扩建工程的投资约可减少二分之一，节约三百万元以上；包钢建筑基地工程可减少投资约一千七百万元。
    武汉的基本建设基地是在1955年10月正式施工的，到1956年绝大部分的企业已经陆续投入生产。当时的建设方针是为武汉钢铁公司第一期工程供应建筑材料和半成品。1956年上半年全国范围掀起了社会主义建设的新高潮以后，武钢第一、二期工程即准备合并进行。经冶金工业部批准，增加投资六百万元扩建武汉建筑基地。今年，国家为了合理使用资金，又重新调整了国家各项建设计划。冶金工业部建筑局根据增产节约的精神，重新研究了武汉基地的扩建问题，认为武汉基地现有的各生产企业在生产规模和服务年限上，基本上是可以满足武钢建设的需要的，只需要在生产上采取某些必要的技术措施，改正原来规划和设计中的某些缺点，就可以使生产潜力进一步发挥，可以不必进行较大规模的扩建。如原来确定新建的第二混凝土搅拌厂、木材联合加工厂锯材车间、沥青加工厂、油漆玻璃车间、中心试验室等项目，可以不再建设，只需在施工现场设立临时性的设施就可以满足施工需要。原来决定扩建的钢筋加工厂、机械化供应站、汽车基地等企业仍旧维持原来规模。根据新方案，武汉基地的投资就可以从六百多万元削减至三百万元左右，为国家节省了一半投资。
    包头建筑基地的设计原来就存在着规模过大、标准过高等浪费现象。冶金工业部建筑局在修改了武汉建筑基地的设计方案以后，接着对包头建筑基地的设计又重新作了研究。
    包头建筑基地原设计规定有混凝土及砂浆搅拌厂、建筑材料磨碎厂、预制品厂、木材联合加工厂、钢筋加工厂、泡沫混凝土厂、机械化供应站等十四个附属、辅助企业及其他设施。经过初步研究的结果，某些企业如混凝土搅拌厂、建筑材料磨碎厂、汽车基地等的设计年产能力可以减低一半左右；机械化供应站可与施工机械修理厂合并；这些企业的建设标准也都合理地降低了。这样，估计基地投资大致可减少五百万元。为了保证包钢建设中砂、石的供应，原来准备自建采石、采砂厂。经过与包头市有关方面商谈的结果，冶金工业部建筑局只需在今年和明年两年中给包头市投入少量资金，并在技术上给予支援，建设包钢所需的砂、石，完全可由包头市负责供应。这样一来，又可以节约投资一千二百万元左右。
