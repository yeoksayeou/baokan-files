Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 18th. The Chongqing Municipal People's Committee, in its streamlining plan passed on the 16th, made appropriate arrangements for the streamlining of government agencies, institutions, and personnel, based on the spirit of seeking truth from facts.

    This plan was determined after more than a month of investigation and research by relevant departments, followed by six or seven discussions and revisions. All units, combined with the characteristics of the city and their respective departments, comprehensively considered the arrangement of institutions and personnel, according to the requirements of the current situation and tasks. The plan stipulates that institutions such as public security, the courts, and some institutions that played a major role during the period of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce accounted for a large proportion of the streamlined institutions and personnel. For example, the Chongqing Municipal Tax Bureau originally had more than 1,600 people. After the upsurge of socialist transformation last year, the tasks were greatly reduced. The bureau promoted a self-assessment tax payment system in more than 300 key state-owned and joint state-private enterprises in the city, and implemented a regular fixed-amount tax collection method for more than 30,000 small vendors. Last year, it transferred surplus personnel accounting for 46.8% of the original establishment to support other units. This year, the bureau decided to continue streamlining 35.2% of its existing establishment.

    In terms of industry and transportation, considering that Chongqing is an important industrial base in Sichuan and is responsible for supporting several newly built industrial cities in the province, in addition to conscientiously carrying out necessary streamlining, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee also appropriately added a few institutions as needed, based on actual needs and without adding more people. For example, factories and mines have been continuously rebuilt and expanded year after year, and the urban area has rapidly expanded to Yangjiaping and other suburbs. The task of urban construction has become increasingly heavy, and the original Urban Construction Committee could not bear it. Therefore, it was decided to separate the existing urban construction sections and offices of this committee and the Chongqing Municipal Construction Engineering Administration, expand them, and establish a separate Urban Construction Bureau.

    With the construction of the Sichuan-Guizhou and Neijiang-Kunming Railways, Chongqing, as an important transportation hub in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, has an increasingly busy transportation task and a growing floating population. The transportation and service industries must have appropriate development. Therefore, the plan also decided to establish a Transportation Bureau and an Urban Service Bureau, respectively, based on the Transportation Company and the Service Company.

    When considering the arrangement of institutions and personnel, all units seriously studied how to overcome bureaucracy and improve leadership style and work methods. In order to bring the leadership closer to the lower levels and strengthen the districts and grass-roots production units, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee has decided to change the three-level system of municipal-level organs to a two-level system, and to abolish and merge 11 overlapping and unnecessary bureau-level institutions and more than 70 section-level institutions, including the complete abolition of the existing seven offices of the Municipal People's Committee. After these offices are abolished, some responsible cadres will be sent down to strengthen the various bureaus and districts. In the future, the mayor and deputy mayors will directly manage the various bureaus according to their division of labor and directly contact the districts, so that they can discover and solve problems existing at the lower levels in a timely manner.

    In the past, many municipal-level organs took on too many specific tasks, which not only affected the enthusiasm of the lower levels but also fostered bureaucracy. This time, the relevant units reconsidered the division of labor between the city and the districts and formally decided to delegate the management authority of handicrafts and certain commercial industries. Since some affairs have been handed over to the districts for management, the relevant municipal-level units can tighten their institutions and free up forces to strengthen the inspection and supervision of the lower levels and the investigation and research of policy implementation. Many units have considered how to rely on the masses and give full play to the enthusiasm of all parties after the establishment has been tightened.

    In the plan passed by the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee, the target for the city's streamlining is 30.72% of the existing establishment. Due to starting from reality and comprehensive consideration, the most anxious problem for all units—where the streamlined people should go—can be basically solved. The Municipal People's Committee has stipulated that the excess personnel should be transferred in batches and in stages according to needs. In the future, all organs and units are not allowed to add personnel except for individual special needs, and the personnel of newly established institutions will be transferred from the original institutions. Sichuan has two newly built industrial cities whose cadre allocation is borne by Chongqing, and a group of people must be transferred here. Chongqing's schools enrolled too many students last year, and there is a shortage of teachers; this year, the enrollment number has been reduced, and the number of private, enterprise-run, and remedial schools for out-of-school students will increase, and a group of people are urgently needed to be transferred to these aspects. In addition, a group of people will be transferred to strengthen the grass-roots production units.

    However, there are also many people in the grass-roots production units, and their tasks are already heavy and their backbone is weak. Therefore, when considering the transfer of people, many units emphasized that strong personnel familiar with production business should be transferred downward, avoiding blindly pushing people down. Some upper-level units do not completely have too many people, but some are because manpower is not organized well, resulting in an uneven phenomenon of being busy and idle. Some units have temporarily too many people in order to arrange old enterprise personnel and solve the problem of labor employment. When considering streamlining work, these units also focused on studying how to tap potential and organize everyone's work very well.

    深入调查　全面考虑　妥善安排
    重庆实事求是进行精简
    新华社重庆18日电  重庆市人民委员会在16日通过的整编方案中，本着实事求是的精神对全市政府机关机构、人员的精简作了妥善的安排。
    这个方案是经过各有关部门一个多月的调查研究，先后讨论、修改六、七次以后才确定的。各单位都结合本市本部门的特点，根据当前形势与任务的要求，通盘考虑了机构、人事的安排。这个方案规定精简的机构、人员中，公安、法院等机构及对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造时期发挥作用较大的一些机构占了较大的比例。例如重庆市税务局原有人员达到一千六百多人，去年社会主义改造高潮后任务大大减少，在全市三百多个国营和公私合营重点企业单位推行了自办纳税制度，对三万多户小商贩实行定期定额收税办法，去年就抽出了占原有编制46.8％的多余人员支援别的单位。今年这个局决定继续精简现有编制的35.2％。
    工业、交通方面，因为考虑到重庆是四川的重要工业基地，担负着支援省内好几个新建工业城市的任务，除认真进行必要的精简外，重庆市人民委员会还根据实际需要在不另增加人的原则下适当增设了少数机构。例如厂矿连年不断改建扩建，城区向郊区杨家坪等地迅速扩展，城市建设任务日益加重，原有的城市建设委员会不能担负，因此确定把这个委员会和重庆市建筑工程管理局现有负责城市建设的科、室分出来，加以扩充另成立城市建设局。
    随着川黔、内昆等铁路的兴建，重庆作为长江上游的重要交通枢纽，运输任务更加繁忙，流动人口日益增多，运输及服务性行业须有适当的发展，因此这个方案还确定以运输公司、服务公司为基础，分别成立交通局和城市服务局。
    各单位在考虑机构、人事的安排时，认真研究了如何克服官僚主义，改进领导作风和工作方法等问题。为了使领导更接近下层，加强各区及基层生产单位，重庆市人民委员会已确定市级机关由三级制改为两级，裁并重叠和不必要的局级机构十一个，科室机构七十多个，其中包括全部撤销市人民委员会现有的七个办公室。这些办公室撤销后，一部分负责干部将下放加强各局各区。今后市长和副市长将按分工直接管各局，直接与区联系，这样可以及时发现和解决下面存在的问题。
    市一级不少机关过去包揽的具体事务过多，不仅影响下面的积极性，且助长了官僚主义。这次有关各单位重新考虑了市与区的分工问题，正式确定将手工业和若干商业行业等的管理权下放。由于有些事务已交各区管理，市级有关单位便可以将机构紧缩，腾出力量加强对下面的检查、督促和对政策执行情况的调查研究。不少单位自编制紧缩后都考虑了如何依靠群众，发挥各方面的积极性等问题。
    重庆市人民委员会在通过的方案中，规定全市精简的指标为现有编制的30.72％。由于从实际出发和通盘的考虑，各单位最焦虑的精简下来的人到那里去的问题基本上能够解决。市人民委员会已规定对多出的人员采取根据需要分批分期陆续有计划调的办法。今后所有机关单位除个别特殊需要以外，一律不许增添人员，新增设的机构人员从原有机构调配。四川有两个新建工业城市干部的配备由重庆担负，这里须调去一批人。重庆的学校去年招生过多，师资缺乏；今年招生数字缩小，为失学的学生举办的民办、企业自办及补习学校将要增加，这方面也急需调去一部分人。此外，将抽调一批人加强基层生产单位。
    但基层生产单位的人也不少，本来就任务重、骨干弱，因此不少单位在考虑调人时，强调要把强的、熟悉生产业务的人员下调，避免盲目把人往下压。某些上层单位也不完全是人多，有的是因为人力没有组织好产生忙闲不均的现象，有的为了安插旧企业人员、解决劳动就业问题，人员暂时过多，这些单位在考虑精简工作时，还着重研究了如何发挥潜力，把每个人的工作组织得很好。
