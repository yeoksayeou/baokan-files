    A Fruit Brokerage in Wuhan
    Zhang Wei
    The Wuhan State-owned Hui Nationality Produce and Fruit Brokerage, after undergoing transformation, has become an important auxiliary force in the state-owned commercial leadership of the free market. It possesses the characteristics of flexible operation, attentive service, and familiarity with the business.
    This brokerage is located next to the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Most of the merchants who entrust it with business are from along the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways. Currently, there are regularly forty to fifty merchants doing business through this brokerage.
    The brokerage has an excellent spirit of service to merchants. It sells goods for consignors and also handles tasks such as picking up goods, transporting goods, and registering taxes on behalf of the consignors. When merchants enter the brokerage, they feel that they don't have to worry about anything themselves. When consignors urgently need money but haven't sold their goods, the brokerage can also temporarily lend them money. When buyers and sellers conduct transactions at the brokerage, buyers can pick up their goods and sellers can quickly receive their money after completing weighing and payment procedures. The brokerage also adopts on-site trading methods to serve merchants. Farmers in the Qingshan area of ​​Wuchang's suburbs, whose watermelons are shipped to Wuhan via the Yangtze River, need to unload their goods at the Hankou Guangdong-Hankou Wharf. To facilitate trade for farmers, the brokerage organizes transactions between buyers and sellers at the Guangdong-Hankou Wharf. The brokerage also takes good care of the merchants' lives.
    Under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperative, this brokerage also plays a role in organizing sources of goods and regulating supply and demand in the free market. The brokerage has close ties with fruit producers and vendors and is very familiar with production and sales conditions in various regions, even knowing how many fruit trees there are in a certain village, when they will be harvested, and when they will be put on the market. Therefore, the brokerage can organize sources of goods at any time based on changes in market conditions. Not long ago, to meet the market's need for dried and fresh fruits, the brokerage organized sources of goods from Mengjin in Henan, Hongqiao and Dapu in Hunan, and Handan in Hebei. Currently, dozens of packages of dried persimmons are traded through this brokerage every day. In November of last year, the value of dried and fresh fruits traded at this brokerage reached more than 85,000 yuan, an increase of more than half compared to the same period last year. The varieties of fruits include oranges from Hunan, Sichuan, and Jiangxi, bananas from Guangdong, and pears from Shandong and Henan, etc.
    Trade through the fruit brokerage can also help stabilize prices in the free market. For commodities with prices set by the supply and marketing cooperative, the fruit brokerage basically trades at the set prices, while also appropriately raising or lowering prices based on the supply of goods. For commodities without set prices, the fruit brokerage determines reasonable prices after understanding the production area prices, regional and seasonal price differences, historical prices, and price ratios of other commodities. They also proactively contact other brokerages to ensure that prices between the various brokerages remain basically consistent. Recently, some consignors (farmers from Xingyang, Henan, etc.) saw that dried persimmons were selling well and wanted to increase the selling price of each load of dried persimmons from 28 yuan to 30 yuan. In reality, the historical highest price for dried persimmons in Wuhan was 24 yuan per load, and the current price in the production area is only a dozen yuan per load. If the price were to be raised again, it would affect the production area prices and the prices of other commodities. After considering these circumstances, the brokerage persuaded the sellers not to raise prices. Sometimes, the brokerage also helps consignors separate good and inferior goods and price them according to grade. When the supply of goods falls short of demand, the brokerage pays attention to fair distribution to prevent the phenomenon of panic buying and price increases. At one point, there was a shortage of fruit in the Wuhan market, and thousands of vendors in the city, state-owned retail units in various districts, and various organizations all wanted fruit from the fruit brokerage. The brokerage distributed the fruit according to the specific circumstances, so that everyone could get goods. Doing so also played a good role in stabilizing prices. This fruit brokerage also sends people to production areas to purchase large quantities of goods such as dried persimmons and red dates, preparing to buy and sell them in the free market to regulate market supply and demand.

    武汉市的一个果行
    张碨
    武汉市国营回民水土果行，经过改造以后，已成为国营商业领导自由市场的一种重要辅助力量。它具有经营灵活、服务周到、熟悉业务的特点。
    这个行栈设在京汉铁路旁边。委托它做买卖的，大多是京汉、粤汉铁路沿线的客商。现在经常有四五十位客商通过这行栈做买卖。
    行栈为客商服务的精神很好。它替货主卖货，也代货主办理提货、运货、登记税收等事务。客商走进行栈，就感到什么都不用自己操心了。货主没卖掉货而急需用钱的时候，行栈还可以暂时借钱给他。买卖双方在行栈进行交易，只要经过过秤、交款两道手续，买主就可以提货回去，货主也可以很快地拿到钱。行栈还采取现场交易的方法来为客商服务。武昌郊区青山一带的农民，经长江运到武汉来的西瓜，要在汉口粤汉码头下船。行栈为便利农民进行贸易，就在粤汉码头组织买卖双方交易。行栈对客商的生活也照顾得很周到。
    这个行栈，在供销社的领导下，在自由市场上，还起着组织货源、调剂供求的作用。行栈和水果生产者、商贩都有密切联系，也很熟悉各地的产销情况，甚至某村有多少果树，何时收获，何时上市，等等，也都清清楚楚。因此，行栈可以根据市场情况的变化，随时组织货源。不久以前，行栈为满足市场上对干鲜果的需要，曾向河南孟津、湖南洪桥和大蒲、河北邯郸等地组织货源。现在，每天经这个行栈成交的柿饼就有几十包。去年11月，在这个行栈成交的干鲜果价值达八万五千多元，比前年同期增多一半以上。水果的品种，有湖南、四川、江西等地的橘子，广东的香蕉，山东、河南的梨等等。
    通过果行贸易，还可以帮助稳定自由市场的物价。供销社有牌价的商品，果行基本上按牌价交易，同时也根据货源情况，适当地调高或降低。没有牌价的商品，果行便在摸清产地价格、地区和季节差价、历史价格和其他商品的比价等情况以后定出合理价格。他们还主动和其他行栈联系，使各行栈之间的价格基本上保持一致。最近，有些货主（河南荥阳等地的农民）见柿饼好销，便想把每担柿饼的售价由二十八元提高到三十元。实际上，武汉市柿饼的历史最高价是二十四元一担，产地现时仅十几元一担，如果再提价便会影响产地价格，也会影响其他商品价格。行栈考虑了这些情况以后，便说服卖主不要涨价。有时，行栈还帮助货主把货物分开好的次的，分等编价。在货物供不应求的时候，行栈便注意进行合理分配，以防抢购涨价现象发生。有一个时期，武汉市场上水果缺乏，市内数千名商贩，各区国营零售单位，各机关团体，都向果行要水果。果行便根据具体情况分配，使大家都能拿到货物。这样做对于稳定物价也起了很好的作用。这个果行还派人到产地收购大批柿饼、红枣等货物，准备在自由市场上吞吐，以调节市场供求。
