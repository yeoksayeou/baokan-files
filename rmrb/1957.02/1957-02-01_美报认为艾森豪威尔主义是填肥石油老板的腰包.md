Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch from New York via TASS: The American "Newsday" published an editorial attacking the "Eisenhower Doctrine," pointing out that America's adventurous policies ultimately affect American taxpayers.

The editorial said: "Imperialism has long infiltrated the Near East and has obtained appalling profits for its small group of representatives from Near Eastern oil operations. Without a doubt, as long as oil exists there, and as long as the people of that 'vacuum' zone have not thrown imperialism out, imperialism will want to continue to stay there."

The newspaper wrote: "We no longer need to deceive ourselves, America's presence in the Near East is not to maintain peace... but to protect the oil rights of some people, those who... are stepping up efforts to fill their pockets by exploiting Near Eastern oil. Our friends – the British and French – also invaded Egypt for the same reason."

    美报认为艾森豪威尔主义是填肥石油老板的腰包
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社纽约29日讯：美国“新闻日报”发表社论抨击“艾森豪威尔主义”，它指出，美国的冒险政策归根结蒂要影响美国纳税人。
    社论说：“帝国主义老早就渗入了近东，并且从近东的石油经营方面为它的一小撮代表人物获得了骇人听闻的利润。毫无疑问，只要那里还存在石油，只要那个‘真空’区的人民还没有把帝国主义扔出来，帝国主义就想继续一直留在那里。”
    这家报纸写道：“我们不用再欺骗自己了，美国在近东的出现并不是为了维护和平……而是为了保护一些人的石油权利，那些人……利用近东的石油正在加紧填塞自己的腰包。我们的朋友——英国人和法国人也是为了同一个原因而侵略埃及的。”
