On New Year's Eve, the "Dragon Beard Ditch" in the capital echoed with the sound of firecrackers.

In a small courtyard on the east side of "Dragon Beard Ditch," the Wang Youfu family gathered to "shou sui" - staying up all night to welcome the arrival of spring.

Tonight, everything is different from the past. The table is full of bottles filled with oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, including a specially made "Laba Garlic." A pot of "fig" trees has already sprouted with lush green buds. The small room is filled with a fresh and joyful atmosphere.

It's already nine o'clock. Mom has urged them several times, but the little ones aren't sleepy. They're jumping and shouting on the bed. Three-year-old Xiao Qin strokes Grandpa's silver-white beard and sings the "Snowman" song: "Snowman, snowman, I ask you, what makes you so healthy? Not wearing a cotton coat or a hat, daring to sit in the snow..." making everyone laugh. Grandpa hugs this clever and lively little granddaughter tightly in his arms.

Wang Youfu is seventy-eight years old this year. He has lived in Dragon Beard Ditch since the fifth year of Emperor Guangxu's reign in the Qing Dynasty. He has spent many New Year's Eves here, but they have all left him with bitter memories. Sometimes, they were so poor that they couldn't even afford oil for the lamp, and the whole family would sit in the dilapidated house in darkness. Sometimes, they could only queue up to buy some "mixed flour" to make food for the Spring Festival.

After liberation, the lives of the people in Dragon Beard Ditch changed as thoroughly as the ditch itself. Wang Youfu's three sons all have good skills and have joined handicraft cooperatives. The second son is in a jade cooperative, and his salary was recently raised from Level 3 to Level 5 in the recent wage reform. The third son is in a bicycle repair cooperative and has recently received two awards. His ten grandchildren are all growing up strong and lovely. The older ones are all in school and wearing red scarves, while the younger ones are playing and jumping at home, all very adorable. To take care of the work of his second son and daughter-in-law, Wang Youfu lives with the second son's family, helps take care of the children, and cooks for them. Before New Year's Eve, both the second son and daughter-in-law received half a month's salary. The daughter-in-law said, "The Spring Festival should be celebrated well and economically, without wasting a single penny." She works diligently all day long and busies herself with housework when she gets off work. Tonight, she rushed to sew the children's colorful clothes and shoes. She bathes the children, washes their feet, and tries on their new colorful clothes and new socks, so that the children can have a beautiful Spring Festival.

Wang Youfu loves his family from the bottom of his heart, even the entire Dragon Beard Ditch. Whenever someone visits Dragon Beard Ditch, they have to come to his house and ask him to tell the story of the people of Dragon Beard Ditch turning over a new leaf. People care about the lives of the people in Dragon Beard Ditch. Tonight, he took out those stacks of letters again to organize and browse through. These letters were sent to him over the years by the Korean People's Army volunteers, advanced workers from all over the country, students, teachers, workers… Each letter is full of cordial concern and enthusiastic praise. These letters have become his most precious souvenirs.

Wang Youfu is particularly happy tonight, and he is talking more than usual. He hopes to make a "sequel" to the "Dragon Beard Ditch" movie to introduce the lives of the people of Dragon Beard Ditch today. His words made everyone laugh, and the joyful laughter intertwined with the sound of firecrackers outside. (Attached pictures)

    除夕的一个家庭	艾玲
    除夕的晚上，首都的“龙须沟”，响起了一片鞭炮声。
    住在“龙须沟”东边的一个小院子里，王有福一家人都团聚在家里“守岁”——通宵不眠来迎接春的降临。
    今晚，一切都和以往不同，桌子上摆满了装满油、盐、酱、醋的瓶子，其中有一瓶是特制的“腊八蒜”。桌旁的一盆“无花果”，已经发出翠嫩的绿芽。小房间充满着清新而又欢悦的气息。
    已经九点钟了。妈妈催了几次啦，小家伙们都不瞌睡，在床上又蹦又叫，三岁的小琴摸着爷爷银白色的大胡须，唱“雪人”歌：“雪人，雪人，我问你，你有什么好身体？不穿棉衣不戴帽，就敢坐在雪地里……”引得大家都笑了。爷爷把这个聪明活泼的小孙女，紧紧地搂在怀里。
    王有福今年七十八岁，从前清光绪五年起，就生长在龙须沟里。在这里，他过了许多的除夕，但遗留给他的都是苦难的记忆。有时，穷得连油灯都点不起，一家人黑漆漆的坐在破烂的房子里；有时，只能排队买些“混合面”，就算做过春节的食品。
    解放了，龙须沟人民的生活像龙须沟一样地彻底改变了。王有福的三个儿子都有一手好手艺，都加入了手工业合作社。二儿子在玉器合作社里，最近工资改革，从三级工提高到五级工。三儿子在修理自行车合作社，最近得过两次奖励。他的十个小孙子，一个个长得结实可爱，大的都在上学，并挂上了红领巾，小的在家里玩着蹦着，都很可爱。王有福为了照顾二儿子两口子的工作，便住在老二家，帮助带孩子，给孩子做饭吃。除夕前，二儿子和媳妇都支领了半个月的工资。媳妇说：“春节要过得又好又节省，不能胡花一个钱”。她一天到晚辛勤劳动，下班回来就忙着做家务活。今天晚上，她将孩子们的花衣裳、鞋子都赶着缝好了。她给孩子洗澡、洗脚、试穿新花衣、新袜子，让孩子们漂漂亮亮过春节。
    王有福从心里喜爱自己的家庭，甚至整个龙须沟，只要有人到龙须沟拜访，都要到他家里请他讲讲龙须沟人民的翻身故事。人们关怀龙须沟人民的生活。今晚他又拿出那一叠叠的信件在整理、翻阅，这些信件是几年来朝鲜志愿军、各地的先进工作者、学生、教师、工人……给他寄来的。每封信都充满着亲切的关怀和热诚的赞扬。这些信成了他最珍贵的纪念品。
    王有福今晚心情格外高兴，话也特别多起来，他希望把“龙须沟”电影再编个“续集”，介绍一下现在的龙须沟人民的生活。他说得大家都笑起来，欢乐的笑声和外边的鞭炮声交织在一起。（附图片）
