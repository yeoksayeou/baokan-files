Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, February 16th: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where the agricultural collectivization movement started relatively late, now has 700,000 farm households of all ethnic groups participating in advanced agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 76.5% of all farm households in the region.

Due to the later completion of land reform in Xinjiang, the planned and vigorous establishment of agricultural cooperatives only began in 1954. Last year, the entire autonomous region achieved elementary agricultural collectivization and simultaneously established more than 2,400 advanced cooperatives. The households participating in advanced cooperatives accounted for 42% of the total number of farm households. After a year of testing, 90% of the cooperatives increased production, generally by 15% to 20%, with the highest exceeding 50%. The increase in production of advanced cooperatives was even more significant. As a result, the total output of wheat, cotton, and oil crops in the entire autonomous region reached the 1957 production target one year ahead of schedule. Due to the increased production of agricultural cooperatives, 85% of cooperative members increased their income. The net income per person in the Wuxing Advanced Cooperative in Turpan County increased by 70% compared to 1955.

The unified management and distribution according to labor system of agricultural cooperatives have greatly tapped the potential hidden in the frontier's agricultural production. Farmers of all ethnic groups have generally consciously and fully utilized their labor capacity. Rural women, especially those of all ethnic groups who previously did not work in the fields or rarely did so, have become an important force in field production. With the rational utilization of labor, agricultural cooperatives have universally carried out sideline production such as animal husbandry, forestry, and fishing, increasing income. In carrying out farmland water conservancy construction, agricultural cooperatives have implemented streamlining expenditures, merging field ridges, building small-scale water conservancy projects, conserving water, and reclaiming small abandoned or uncultivable wasteland. Last year, the cultivated area expanded by more than 700,000 mu as a result.

Collectivization has brought the previously relatively backward production technology here into a new stage of development. Last year, agricultural cooperatives throughout the region were equipped with more than 50,000 new-style farm tools of various kinds, more than the total increase in the past six years. Many farmers who previously did not even have a hoe or could only use wooden plows have become skilled at operating new-style farm tools. Last year, the area of land plowed with new-style plows reached 80% throughout the region. In the land where seeds had always been sown by hand for generations, strip sowing methods were adopted on 50% to 60% of the area last year. Agricultural cooperatives have also demonstrated immense strength in ensuring the quality of cultivation, improving field management techniques, and preventing and controlling natural disasters such as pests and diseases.

Collectivization has further promoted the unity of all ethnic groups. According to statistics from 34 counties including Urumqi, there are 822 joint ethnic cooperatives with members from more than two ethnic groups. These cooperatives are either composed of various ethnic groups who believe in Islam, or composed of several ethnic groups with different religious beliefs, customs, and languages. On the basis of harmonious coexistence in the past, they jointly manage the affairs of the cooperatives, help each other, take care of each other, learn from each other, and divide labor.

Rural cultural life, rural health, post and telecommunications, and radio listening have also achieved unprecedented progress.

The superiority displayed by agricultural collectivization is attracting farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to continue advancing towards the path of advanced collectivization. According to the current situation of a large number of elementary cooperatives continuing to transform into advanced cooperatives, relevant departments in the autonomous region predict that the number of farm households participating in advanced cooperatives will account for about 90% before spring plowing.

### 85％社员增加收入　各族人民更加团结  新疆农业社显示出巨大力量

    85％社员增加收入　各族人民更加团结
    新疆农业社显示出巨大力量
    新华社乌鲁木齐16日电　农业合作化运动开始较晚的新疆维吾尔自治区，目前已有七十万各族农户加入高级农业社，这些农户占全区农户的76.5％。
    新疆由于土地改革完成较晚，有计划地大力建立农业社的工作在1954年才开始。全自治区去年实现了初级农业合作化，同时建立了两千四百多个高级社，加入高级社的农户占农户总数的42％。经过去年一年的考验，90％的社都增产，一般增产一成半到两成，最高的在五成以上，高级社的增产更为显著。全自治区小麦、棉花和油料作物的总产量，因此提前一年达到1957年的生产指标。由于农业社增产，85％的社员增加收入。吐鲁番县五星高级社去年每人的纯收入比1955年增加70％。
    农业社统一经营管理和按劳取酬的制度，把蕴藏在边疆农业生产中的潜力大大发掘了出来。各族农民普遍自觉地充分发挥和使用了自己的劳动能力；农村妇女特别是过去不下田或很少下田的各族妇女，已成为田间生产的一支重要力量。劳动力合理利用，农业社普遍开展牧、林、渔等副业生产，增加了收入。农业社在进行农田水利建设中实行裁支并干，合并田埂，兴修小型水利，节约用水，开垦过去废弃的或无力开垦的小片荒地，去年由此扩大的耕地就有七十多万亩。
    合作化已使这里一向较为落后的生产技术，进入了一个新的发展阶段。去年全区农业社装备的各种新式农具共有五万多件，比过去六年内增加的总和还多。许多过去连砍土镘都没有或者只能使用木犁的农民，已经成了操纵新式农具的能手。全区去年使用新式犁耕地的面积达到80％。在祖祖辈辈一直靠手撒种的土地上，去年有50％到60％采用了条播的方法。在保证耕作质量，改进田间管理技术和防治病虫等自然灾害的工作中，农业社也显示出巨大的力量。
    合作化进一步促进了各民族的团结。据乌鲁木齐等三十四个县的统计，社内成员在两个民族以上的民族联合社有八百二十二个。这些社或者是由信仰伊斯兰教的各民族组成的，或者是由几个宗教信仰、风俗习惯和语言各不相同的民族组成的。他们在过去和睦相处的基础上，共同管理合作社的事务，互相帮助，互相照顾，互相学习，分工劳动。
    农村文化生活、农村卫生、邮电和广播收听等事业也获得了前所未有的进步。
    农业合作化显示的优越性，吸引着新疆各族农民继续向高级合作化的道路前进。自治区有关部门根据目前大批初级社正继续转为高级社的情况预计，参加高级社的农户到春耕前将占到90％左右。
