A modern instrument factory - the Xi'an Instrument Factory, is being built in the "Electrical Engineering City" in the suburbs of Xi'an. The employee welfare project, which began construction in November last year, has now built more than 6,000 square meters of buildings and bungalows; the auxiliary workshops in the production area will begin construction in the third quarter of this year. This factory, which is being built using the method of "construction, installation, and production at the same time," is expected to have some workshops put into production in the second quarter of 1958, and the entire factory can be officially put into production in April 1959. After the start of production, it can manufacture more than 400,000 pieces of thermal instruments and automatic control regulators per year.

The Xi'an Instrument Factory was designed with the help of the German Democratic Republic. It is a comprehensive instrument factory that can not only manufacture more than 140 kinds of products for the chemical, petroleum, electric power, metallurgy and other industries, such as pressure gauges, vacuum gauges, temperature measuring instruments, electronic instruments, flow meters, regulators, gas analyzers, automotive instruments and various accessories. This factory is also responsible for cultivating technical forces, researching and developing new products, and creating conditions for the establishment of specialized instrument factories in the future.

    一座现代化仪表厂在西安兴建
    本报讯　我国又一座现代化的仪表厂——西安仪表厂，正在西安郊区的“电工之城”兴建。去年11月间动工的职工福利工程，现在已建筑起楼房和平房六千多平方公尺；生产区的辅助车间将在今年第三季度开始施工。这座采取“边施工、边安装、边生产”进行建设的工厂，预计到1958年第二季度就有部分车间投入生产，全厂到1959年4月就可以正式开工生产。开工以后，一年可以制造热工仪表和自动控制调节器等四十多万件。
    西安仪表厂，是德意志民主共和国帮助我们进行设计的。它是一座综合性的仪表厂，不仅能给化工、石油、电力、冶金等工业制做压力表、真空表、测温仪表、电子仪表、流量计、调节器、气体分析器、车用仪表和各种配件等约一百四十多种产品。这个工厂还负有培养技术力量、研究和发展新产品的任务，给将来建立专业化仪表工厂创造条件。
