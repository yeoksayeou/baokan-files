The Widest River in the World

Walking less than ten minutes from the center of Montevideo, you arrive at the banks of the Rio de la Plata (meaning Silver River). It is said that the Rio de la Plata is the widest river in the world. Indeed, it is a river that stretches as far as the eye can see. Taking a boat from Montevideo to Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, across the river takes a whole night. The riverbank is almost like a coast, with beaches and tides. If you ask the locals, some will say it is a river, and others will simply say it is the sea. And both have ample arguments to convince you.

Right on this riverbank, we tried typical Uruguayan cuisine. Upon entering, you can see large chunks of beef on an iron grill over a large stove, with pine firewood crackling and oil dripping from the grill into the fire. The waiter, seeing that we were foreigners, took the initiative to suggest that a portion for two would be enough for four people. But when the so-called two servings of grilled beef were brought up, the four of us were greatly surprised. This was beef, beef kidney, beef tongue, beef intestines, beef tripe, blood sausage... The meat could not be cut with ordinary knives, so the waiter brought a serrated large knife and sharpened it in front of the guests. Once the beef was cut open, the inside was still red meat and blood, but it tasted exceptionally tender.

It is said that Uruguay has an average of three cows per resident, and the residents' meat consumption is the highest in the world. Soldiers, in particular, are said to receive one or two kilograms of beef every day. In order to boost exports, the government is calling on people to eat more fish and shrimp. Uruguay has abundant aquatic products, but residents are not used to eating them. The most typical Uruguayan meal is still large pieces of iron-grilled offal and beef.

It is said that in this country, rich in meat and leather, the sales of meat are currently facing difficulties. International trusts have pushed meat prices too low, and some meat factories can only operate at half capacity. Therefore, the proposal to expand trade with China is supported from top to bottom in Uruguay. (End of full text) (With picture)

    南美见闻	赵沨
    世界上最宽的河
    从蒙得维的亚的市中心走不上十分钟，便到了拉巴拉他河（意思就是银河）的河边。据说，拉巴拉他河是世界上最宽的一条河。的确，是一条一眼望不到边的河，从蒙得维的亚坐轮船到河对岸的阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯，需要整整一夜的时间。河岸简直和海岸一样，有沙滩，有潮涨潮落。你要问当地的人，有人说这是河，有人索性说这就是海。并且，二者都有充足的论据来说服你。
    就在这个河边，我们尝试了典型的乌拉圭的菜肴。一进门，就可以看见大炉子上的铁扒上，满是大块大块的牛肉，松柴火劈劈叭叭地响着，油就从铁扒上流到火里。侍者看见我们是外来人，便主动地建议四个人只要一个二人的份量就足够了。而当所谓两客烤牛肉端上来之后，足使四个人大吃一惊。这是牛肉、牛腰、牛舌、牛肠、牛肚、牛血灌肠……这些肉用普通的餐刀是切不开的，侍者拿来一个锯齿状的大刀，并且当着客人把它磨利。牛肉一切开，里面还是红肉和鲜血，但吃起来却鲜嫩异常。
    据说，乌拉圭的居民平均每个人有三头牛，居民对肉的消耗量是全世界最高的，特别是士兵，据说每人每天可以得到一、二公斤牛肉。为了争取出口，政府号召人们多吃鱼虾。乌拉圭水产很丰富，但居民不习惯食用水产。乌拉圭最典型的饭菜仍是大块的铁扒烤牛杂、牛肉。
    据说，在这个盛产肉类、皮革的国家，目前肉类的销路正遭遇着困难。国际托辣斯把肉价压得太低了，有些肉类工厂只能半开工。所以，扩大同中国贸易的主张在乌拉圭是从上到下都赞同的。（全文完）（附图片）
