    Using Drugs to Inhibit Thyroid Function
    Hog Fattening Can Be Accelerated
    (This report) According to information from this newspaper: Zheng Zaojie, the director of the pharmacology teaching and research section of Changchun Veterinary University, along with lecturers Yang Zhikui and Luo Jinggui, have successfully conducted research on using drugs for hog fattening. With the assistance of staff from the First Warehouse of the Changchun Food Company's Livestock Products Store, they successively experimented with feeding drugs to over 250 hogs. Each hog gained an average of 1.34 *jin* (approximately 0.67 kg or 1.48 lbs) of meat per day, while hogs fed with ordinary feed only gained 0.62 *jin* (approximately 0.31 kg or 0.68 lbs) of meat per day. The duration of drug feeding was 50 days for each hog, resulting in a total weight gain of 67 *jin* (approximately 33.5 kg or 73.8 lbs), which is 36 *jin* (approximately 18 kg or 39.7 lbs) more than hogs not fed with drugs.
    According to slaughterhouse evaluations, these drug-fed fattened hogs yielded high-quality meat, with a net meat yield of up to 76% of the live weight. Microscopic observation revealed an increase in fat cells and slight dilation of capillaries within the meat. In terms of appearance, the fat layer and lean meat layer were distinctly distributed, with the fat layer being thicker than that of hogs not fed with drugs. The meat color was fresh, and the taste was as fragrant as that of pork from hogs not fed with drugs. The drug's function is to inhibit thyroid function, thereby reducing metabolism and preventing energy consumption, ultimately achieving the goal of fattening without any side effects.

    用药物抑制甲状腺机能
    生猪育肥可以加快
    本报讯　长春兽医大学药理教研室主任郑藻杰和讲师杨智奎、罗景桂用药物肥猪的研究工作，已经获得成功。他们在长春食品公司畜产商店第一仓库工作人员的协助下，曾经先后试用药物喂了二百五十多口猪，每口猪每天平均长肉一点三四市斤，而用一般饲料喂的猪每天每口却只长肉零点六二斤。每口猪可以喂药物期间是五十天，共能长肉六十七斤，比不用药物喂的猪多长肉三十六斤。
    这些用药物喂养的肥猪，据屠宰场鉴定是上等肉，即净肉可达毛猪重的76％。在显微镜下观察，肉内脂肪细胞增多，毛细管稍扩张。在外观上，脂肪层和瘦肉层间隔分布，比不用药物喂的猪脂肪层厚，肉色新鲜，且味道和不用药物喂的猪肉一样香。药的作用是抑制甲状腺机能，使新陈代谢降低，防止能量消耗以达到肥育的目的，所以没有任何副作用。
