Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 9th. A group of plant physiologists, chemists, and agronomists gathered in Shanghai from the 6th to the 8th to discuss domestic research on plant growth hormones and how to vigorously develop this work according to the national science development plan.

This symposium was convened by the Academic Committee of the Institute of Plant Physiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Mastering and utilizing plant growth hormones to control plant growth according to human wishes is a young and interesting science. Plant biologists discovered long ago that there is a substance in plants that can promote plant growth. Since 1934, chemists have synthesized many organic compounds that are the same as or similar to plant growth hormones and can stimulate plant growth. These artificially manufactured plant growth hormones are called plant stimulants or plant regulators. Tiny amounts of stimulants can promote plant growth, allowing flower houses to bear fruit without pollination, ripening fruits earlier and without seeds; enabling tree grafts to root and survive quickly for mass propagation; and also preventing the shedding of flowers, fruits, and leaves. On the other hand, spraying larger amounts of stimulants can artificially inhibit plant growth. For example, it can prevent stored potatoes, onions, and other vegetables from sprouting for a long time, making them edible until July and August of the following year; delay the germination of fruit trees to avoid early spring frost damage; cause plants to defoliate and dry up before harvest for machine operation; and prevent shedding before fruits ripen. Plant stimulants can also be used to eliminate weeds, allowing crops to grow without hindrance throughout their entire growth process.

This research not only helps people understand and master the secrets of plant growth, but the research results can also be used directly to increase the unit yield of crops and cash crops. In many countries, especially the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, plant stimulants are increasingly widely used in production, and their new uses are constantly being discovered.

In the past ten years, some scientists in our country have been engaged in research on plant stimulants and have published about twenty papers. Professor Yang Shixian has synthesized nine plant stimulants one after another. After small-scale tests, it was found that two or three of them have excellent efficacy in promoting plant growth and eliminating weeds. Professor Hu Bingfang has also synthesized a new type of plant stimulant.

In the suburbs of large cities such as Shanghai and Beijing, the plant stimulant "2,4-D" has been applied in tomato production. Spraying a tiny amount of this solvent when tomatoes are in bloom prevents the flowers from falling off, and the fruits are larger and more numerous.

Scientists Yang Shixian, Lou Chenghou, Li Shuxuan, Tang Yuwei, and others presented reports at the meeting on the chemical research of plant stimulants and how they prevent the abscission of plant organs. The meeting also discussed the theory and application methods of plant stimulants.

The scientists attending the symposium decided to first master the research results of advanced countries, prepare various plant stimulants with excellent efficacy, and carry out large-scale field trials in various regions. Within two to three years, they will initially summarize the required dosages, the most suitable application methods and times for various regions, and lay a broad foundation for widespread promotion in conjunction with China's actual conditions, while carrying out theoretical research and actively searching for and synthesizing new plant growth hormones with greater efficacy. At the symposium, the scientists initially determined the division of labor and cooperation methods in this research.

The scientists also proposed that the agricultural departments should give more importance and support to this new research.

    如何按照人类愿望控制植物生长
    科学工作者座谈生长素的研究工作
    新华社上海9日电　一批植物生理学家、化学家、农学家，6日到8日在上海座谈国内已经进行的植物生长素的研究问题，以及如何根据国家科学发展规划大力开展这项工作。
    这次座谈会是中国科学院植物生理研究所学术委员会召开的。
    掌握和利用植物生长素，按照人类的愿望来控制植物的生长，这是一门年轻而有趣的科学。很早以前植物学家们就发现植物体内有一种物质能够促进植物的生长。从1934年开始，化学家们合成了许多种和植物体内的生长素同样或相似的能刺激植物生长的有机化合物，这些用人为方法制造出来的植物生长素被称为植物刺激剂或植物控制剂。微量的刺激剂可以促进植物生长，使植物的花房不须受粉就能结出果实，使果实提早成熟而且果内无子；使树木的接枝能迅速生根成活，以便大量繁殖；还可以防止花果及叶子的脱落。另一方面，喷洒数量较多的刺激剂却又可以人为地抑制植物的生长。例如能使窖藏的马铃薯、洋葱等菜蔬持久不抽芽，直到第二年的7、8月还可以食用；使果树延迟萌幼，以免受早春霜害；使植物在收获前脱叶与枯干，以便机器操作；在果实成熟前防止脱落。植物刺激剂还可以用于消除杂草，让作物在全部生长过程中不受妨害。
    这项研究不仅有助于人们了解和掌握植物生长的秘密，而且研究成果能够用来直接提高农作物和经济作物的单位产量。在不少国家特别是英、美、苏联，植物刺激剂已经日益广泛地应用在生产中，它们的新用途还在不断地发现。
    过去十年来，我国已经有一些科学家从事植物刺激剂的研究，并且发表过论文约二十篇。化学家杨石先教授先后合成了九种植物刺激剂，经过小规模试验，发现其中有两三种具有很好的促进植物成长和消除杂草的效能。胡秉方教授也合成了一种新型的植物刺激剂。
    在上海、北京等大城市的郊区，已在番茄生产中应用植物刺激剂“二四滴”。番茄开花时候喷射上微量的这种溶剂，番茄花不脱落，果实结得又大又多。
    科学家杨石先、娄成后、李曙轩、汤玉玮等在会上作了植物刺激剂的化学研究、它们如何防止植物器官的脱落等问题的报告。会上还讨论了植物刺激剂的理论和应用方法。
    参加座谈会的科学家们决定首先掌握先进国家的研究成果，制备有卓越效能的各种植物刺激剂，并在各地区开展较大规模的田间试验，在两三年内初步总结出各地所需要的剂量，最适宜的施用方式和时间，结合我国实际情况打下广泛推广的基础，同时开展理论性的研究，积极寻找和合成新的有更高效能的植物刺激素。座谈会上，科学家们初步确定了在这项研究中的分工和合作办法。
    科学家们还提出，要求农业部门对这项新的研究给予更多的重视和支持。
