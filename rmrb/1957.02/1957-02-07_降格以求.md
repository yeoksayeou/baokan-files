    Stooping to Conquer

    Not long ago, American newspapers competed to publish derogatory remarks about Britain, contemptuously mocking Britain by saying, "John Bull must cling tightly to Uncle Sam's coattails." This caused great dissatisfaction in British public opinion at the time, which considered it an insult to Britain. However, not long after that, a British political commentator named Crossman published an article in the January issue of the American "Foreign Affairs" quarterly, openly advocating that Britain should maintain a subordinate relationship with the United States.

    Crossman believes that Britain should realize from the failure of the Suez Crisis that "nothing can be done without American support," so it must attach importance to the Anglo-American alliance and "build the alliance on a more solid foundation." He shamelessly said: "At present, there is a need to establish an alliance relationship in which a strong country (referring to the United States) holds full power, and weak countries (referring to Britain, France, and other 'allies') are neither completely independent nor completely dependent. Weak countries can refuse the orders of strong countries, but must obtain the help and consent of strong countries when deciding on major policies." And "the best example of this relationship is the relationship between Britain and the Commonwealth countries for many years, especially the relationship between Britain and Australia." He also pointed out that the British should accept this unpleasant reality with peace of mind, because "in fact, the balance of power between the United States and Britain is exactly equal to that between Britain and Australia."

    This strategist is in fact advocating that in order for the United States to support it in maintaining its crumbling imperial position, Britain has no choice but to willingly retreat and act as a second-rate leader, and even might as well have the British Commonwealth subordinate to the "Greater American Commonwealth." This is truly "its cry is sad."

    But the question is, can Britain achieve its wishes by "stooping to conquer"? Will the infinitely greedy American ruling group give Britain appropriate consideration because Britain has "admitted defeat"? Things are obviously not so ideal. Even Crossman himself cannot but admit that the United States has always believed that "the alliance can only be effective on issues that the United States considers important, and not on issues that Britain and France consider important." In other words, the United States is only using its "alliance" with Britain and France to pursue its own interests, and does not put the interests of Britain and France in its heart. The release of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and Dulles's remarks advocating that the United States should "go it alone" in the Middle East all show that the United States is not prepared to take care of the interests of Britain and France, even if these two "poor relatives," Britain and France, humbly cling tightly to Uncle Sam's coattails. This is the reason why the Anglo-American alliance cannot be built on the kind of "solid foundation" envisioned by Crossman.

    降格以求
    不久以前美国的报刊争相发表蔑视英国的言论，轻蔑地揶揄英国说：“约翰牛必须紧紧地扯住山姆大叔的衣服下摆”。当时在英国的舆论中曾引起很大的不满，认为这是对英国的一种侮辱。但是，这事过了没有好久，一个名叫克罗塞的英国政论家在今年1月号的美国“外交季刊”上发表了一篇文章，却公开主张英国应该对美国保持一种从属的关系。
    克罗塞认为英国应该从侵埃失败中发现“没有美国的支持，什么都做不成”，因此必须重视美英联盟，而且“使联盟建立在更加巩固的基础上”。他毫不害羞地说：“目前需要建立一种强国（指美国）掌握全权，弱国（指英、法等‘盟国’）既非完全独立又非完全依附的联盟关系。弱国可以不接受强国的命令，但是在决定主要政策时必须取得强国的帮助和同意。”而“这种关系最好的例子是英国多年来同英语联邦国家的关系，尤其是英国同澳大利亚的关系”。他并且指出：英国人应当心安理得地接受这种不愉快的现实，因为“事实上美英之间同英澳之间的力量对比恰恰相等”。
    这位策士事实上就是主张英国为了要美国支持它保持其摇摇欲坠的帝国地位，只好甘心情愿退而充当二号盟主，甚至不妨大使英联邦从属于“大美联邦”之下。这真是“其鸣也哀”了。
    但是问题是，英国这样“降格以求”是否就能够如愿以偿呢？贪欲无穷的美国统治集团是否会因为英国已“甘拜下风”就给予英国以适当的照顾呢？事情显然并不这么理想。连克罗塞自己也不能不承认，美国向来就认为“联盟只能在美国认为重要的问题上起作用，而不能在英法认为重要的问题上生效”。换句话说，美国只是利用它同英法的“联盟”来追求自己的利益，而并不把英法的利益放在心里。“艾森豪威尔主义”的出炉、杜勒斯主张美国在中东要“单独干”的言论，都表明了美国并不准备照顾英法的利益，即使英国和法国这两位“穷亲戚”低声下气地紧紧扯住山姆大叔的衣服下摆。这就是美英联盟无法建立在克罗塞所设想的那种“巩固基础上”的道理。
