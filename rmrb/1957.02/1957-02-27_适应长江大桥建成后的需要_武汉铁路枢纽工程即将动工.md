    To meet the needs after the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Wuhan Railway Hub project will soon be fully launched. At present, the preliminary technical design of the project has been completed. The Railway Engineering Corps responsible for the construction has begun to travel to the construction site in batches.
    The Wuhan Railway Hub project is very large in scale. The area of ​​the hub station alone, including the newly built, expanded and renovated areas, will reach forty kilometers. The construction project starts from Danshuichi Station in Hankou, along the newly built bypass line to the bridgehead of the Hanshui River Bridge, crosses the Hanshui River to Hanyang Station to the Yangtze River. Crossing the Yangtze River, it passes through Wuchang Freight Station, Passenger Station, Technical Operation Station to Yujiawan Station in the south; and Shahu Passing Station in the north to Wuchang North Station. All stations in the Hankou area, part of the Hanyang area, and most stations in the Wuchang area on the railway line will be rebuilt and expanded. In addition, many new stations will be built. These include the Jiang'an New Station and Wuchang Passenger Station with huge modern equipment; after these two stations are completed, they will undertake the marshalling tasks of all vehicles on the Jinghan and Yuehan lines. To connect the newly built stations, a bypass line of more than fifteen kilometers and four large and medium-sized bridges will also be newly built. The entire hub will lay more than 70 kilometers of track.
    Mechanical construction will be used for this project. More than 100 bulldozers, scrapers, excavators and other earthmoving machinery and more than 90 other machinery are being shipped to the construction site one after another. (According to "People's Railway")

    适应长江大桥建成后的需要
    武汉铁路枢纽工程即将动工
    本报讯　适应武汉长江大桥建成后的需要，武汉铁路枢纽工程即将全面动工。目前，工程初步技术设计已经完成。担负施工的铁道兵已经开始分批开往工地。
    武汉铁路枢纽工程规模很大，枢纽站的面积，仅是新建、扩建和改建的范围就将达四十公里。修建工程从汉口的丹水池车站开始，沿新建的迂回线到汉水大桥桥头，跨过汉水经汉阳车站到长江。越过长江，南经武昌货站、客站、技术作业站到余家湾车站；北经沙湖会让站，到武昌北站。铁路线上汉口区的全部车站、汉阳区的一部分，武昌区的大部分车站，都将改建和扩建。此外还将修建许多新的车站。其中包括规模巨大的现代化设备的江岸新站和武昌客站；这两个车站建成后，将担负京汉、粤汉两线全部车辆的编组任务。联结新建的车站，还将新建一条十五公里多长的迂回线和四座大中桥梁。整个枢纽将铺轨七十多公里。
    这个工程将采用机械施工。一百多台推土机、铲运机、挖土机等土方机械和九十多台其他机械，正在陆续运往工地。（据“人民铁道”）
