Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 24th: The Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Professional Conference, with the central theme of making every effort to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, explored measures to increase production in Shanxi Province this year and formulated a plan for continued production increase this year. The plan stipulates that this year, the province's total grain output will increase to 9 billion catties on the basis of 8.67 billion catties last year, striving to reach 9.2 billion catties; the total cotton output will increase by 60 million catties compared to last year; and the total oilseed output will increase by 50 million catties compared to last year.

During the nine-day conference from February 15th to 23rd, agricultural leaders from various regions, after studying the characteristics of agricultural production in Shanxi Province, pointed out that Shanxi Province does not have much arable land, and the key to increasing production lies in making every effort to increase the unit area yield of existing cultivated land. The conference proposed six major measures to continue increasing unit area yield this year: mobilize agricultural cooperatives to greatly increase fertilizer, striving to increase the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of cultivated land throughout the province by 10% to 20% compared to last year; rely on agricultural cooperatives to vigorously build small-scale water conservancy projects, ensuring both quality and quantity, and simultaneously combining flood prevention and drainage with expanding irrigation areas, and combining digging canals and wells with adding water lifting tools, so that each project is used wherever it is built; comprehensively carry out soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas, adopting the method of comprehensive, concentrated, and continuous management by river basin, strengthening technical guidance, and closely integrating long-term construction with increasing production in the current year; promote improved varieties on 80% of the sown area according to local conditions, improve the farming system and farming techniques according to local conditions, cultivate intensively and meticulously, expand intercropping, increase planting of high-yield crops, and promote new experiences; maintain constant vigilance and carry out a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, and promote the experience of the Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Ping Shun County in fighting disasters last year throughout the province.

At the beginning of the meeting, some cadres believed that last year's production increase was mainly due to favorable weather conditions, while others emphasized the production difficulties and insufficient funds of some disaster-stricken cooperatives last year, as well as other difficult conditions, and were somewhat skeptical about continuing to increase production this year. After repeated discussions and studies, tapping the potential for increasing production, it was clarified that increasing production depends on hard work. After criticizing the erroneous idea of "rather low than high" in formulating plans, everyone revised the agricultural production plans of various regions in a realistic manner and formulated the agricultural production plan for the entire province.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 23rd: Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, announced that Hubei Province, which achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, will strive for an even greater harvest this year. The planned total grain output will reach 22.5 billion catties, cotton will reach over 4.4 million dan, oilseeds will reach 810 million catties, and live pigs will reach 7 million heads, representing increases of 7%, 10% to 15%, 39.1%, and 40% respectively compared to last year. At the same time, efforts will be made to create 3,000 agricultural cooperatives with an average grain yield of 1,000 catties per mu, 1,500 cooperatives with a cotton yield of 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu, and 8,000 cooperatives with an average of two pigs raised per household. Other fishery products, ramie, and tea will also be greatly increased.

This production increase plan was announced by Zhang Tixue to more than 1,000 agricultural labor models at the ongoing Second Hubei Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference. Zhang Tixue said that this production increase plan is achievable because everyone already has some experience in running cooperatives; has accumulated a set of agricultural technology reform methods for increasing production; and at the same time, the province achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest last year, resulting in more production investment than in previous years; and winter production was better than any year before. These are all favorable conditions for increasing production this year. Of course, we must also see the difficulties. For example, natural disasters may occur this year, deviations may occur in leadership work, and industrial support for agriculture may not be fully satisfied, but these are all difficulties in the course of progress and can be overcome.

Speaking about how to achieve this production increase plan, Zhang Tixue pointed out that in addition to further implementing the principles of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and democratic management of cooperatives, the most important thing is to continue to promote the agricultural technology reform centered on the "Five Transformations," which achieved great success last year. This year, the province will expand the conversion of single-season rice to double-season rice and the conversion of dry land to paddy fields to nearly 5 million mu (more than double last year), the Daizi cotton variety will be basically popularized, and the area of improved varieties of wheat and oil crops will reach 60% to 70%, gradually converting slopes into terraced fields and low-yield crops into high-yield crops. Around these reforms, we must also do a good job in farmland water conservancy, soil and water conservation, fertilizer accumulation, and seed selection. Zhang Tixue particularly emphasized that in carrying out these technological reforms, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, adapt to the conditions of the cooperatives, and act according to one's capabilities.

    想尽一切办法争取今年大丰收
    山西提出提高单位产量的六大措施　湖北推行以“五改”为中心的技术改革
    据新华社太原24日电　以想尽一切办法争取今年农业大丰收为中心议题的山西省农业专业会议，探讨了山西省今年农业方面的增产措施，制定了今年继续增产的计划。计划规定，今年全省粮食总产量在去年八十六亿七千万斤的基础上提高到九十亿斤，争取达到九十二亿斤；棉花总产量比去年增加六千万斤；油料总产量比去年增加五千万斤。
    在15日到23日的九天会议中，出席会议的各地农业领导干部在研究了山西省农业生产上的一些特点后指出，山西省可垦荒地不多，增产的关键在于想尽一切办法提高现有耕地的单位面积产量。会议提出今年继续提高单位面积产量的六大措施：发动农业社大量增加肥料，争取全省每亩耕地施肥量比去年增加一成到两成；依靠农业社大力兴修小型水利，保证质、量兼优，同时把防洪排涝和扩大灌溉面积、开渠打井和增添提水工具结合起来，作到有一处用一处；在山区全面开展水土保持工作中，采取按流域综合、集中和连续治理的办法，加强技术指导，使长期建设和当年增产密切结合；在80％的播种面积上因地制宜推广良种，因地制宜地改进耕作制度和耕作技术，精耕细作，扩大间作，增种高产作物，推广新经验；经常保持警惕，向自然灾害进行顽强斗争，在全省范围内推广平顺县金星农林牧生产合作社去年抗灾的经验。
    会议开始的时候，一部分干部认为去年增产主要是风调雨顺，另一部分干部强调去年部分受灾社生产有困难和资金不足，以及其他困难条件，对今年继续提高产量有些怀疑。经过反复讨论研究，挖掘增产潜力，明确了增产取决于努力工作。在批判制定计划“宁低勿高”的错误想法以后，大家实事求是地修订了各地区的农业生产计划，制定了全省的农业生产计划。
    新华社武汉23日电　湖北省省长张体学宣布：去年获得空前丰收的湖北省，今年要争取更大的丰收。计划粮食总产量达到二百二十五亿斤，棉花达到四百四十万担以上，油料达到八亿一千万斤，生猪达到七百万头；分别比去年增长7％、10％到15％，39.1％和40％。同时，争取出现三千个平均亩产粮食千斤的农业社，一千五百个亩产皮棉百斤的社和八千个每户平均养猪两头的社。其他渔产、苎麻和茶叶等也要大大增产。
    这个增产计划，是张体学在正在举行的湖北省第二届农业劳动模范代表大会上，向一千多名农业劳动模范宣布的。张体学说，这个增产计划是可以办得到的。因为，大家已经有了一定的办社经验；积累了一套农业技术改革的增产办法；同时去年全省获得空前丰收，有了比往年更多的生产投资；冬季生产又比任何一年都搞得好。这些，都是今年增产的有利条件。当然，也要看到困难。譬如，今年可能发生自然灾害，领导工作上也可能出现偏差，工业对农业的支援不可能充分满足，但是，这都是前进中的困难，是可以克服的。
    谈到如何实现这个增产计划时，张体学指出：除进一步贯彻勤俭办社和民主办社外，最主要的就是继续推行去年获得巨大成效的、以“五改”为中心的农业技术改革。今年，全省单季稻改双季稻，旱地改水田要扩大到近五百万亩（比去年多一倍），岱字棉种基本上普及，小麦和油料作物的良种面积要达到60％到70％，逐步地把坡地改为梯田，低产作物改为高产作物。围绕这些改革，还要搞好农田水利、水土保持、积肥和选种。张体学特别强调，在进行这些技术改革时，必须因地制宜、因社制宜和量力而为。
