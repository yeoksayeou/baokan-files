Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 24th: This year, Poland's power system will increase its generating capacity by 800,000 kilowatts, a figure almost equal to half of Poland's total generating capacity in 1938. Currently, Poland's annual power generation is almost five times that of pre-war levels.

At present, Poland is widely building new thermal power stations, hydropower stations, and other power projects. According to the "People's Forum" newspaper, the construction of the Warsaw Thermal Power Center will be completed this year and will be fully put into production. At the same time, construction of the country's second thermal power center will begin in Łódź this year. Some newly built thermal power stations in Czosów, Kraków, Poznań and other provinces will begin supplying electricity this year.

Poland is building and rebuilding fifteen hydropower stations, including the Brzeg-Dolna hydropower station, which will begin supplying electricity this year. The vast majority of the rest will also begin generating electricity during the 1956-1960 Five-Year Plan period.

    波兰广泛兴建热电站和水电站
    今年将增加八十万瓩发电能力
    据新华社华沙24日电　今年波兰的电力系统将增加八十万瓩的发电能力，这个数字几乎等于1938年波兰全国发电能力的一半。目前波兰每年的发电量差不多是战前的五倍。
    现在，波兰正在广泛兴建新的热电站、水电站以及其他动力工程。根据“人民论坛报”的消息，华沙热电中心的建设将在今年完成，并且将全力投入生产。同时，今年还将在罗兹开始兴建全国第二个热电中心。在彻索夫、克拉科夫、波兹南等省新建的一些热电站都将在今年开始供电。
    波兰正在修建和重建的水电站有十五个，其中布热格—多尔纳水电站今年将开始供电。其余的绝大多数也将在1956—1960年的五年计划期间内开始发电。
