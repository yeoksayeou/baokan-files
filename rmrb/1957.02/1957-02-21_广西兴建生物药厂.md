Guangxi to Build Biological Pharmaceutical Factory

    (Our Dispatch) A modern veterinary biological pharmaceutical factory—the Guangxi Biological Pharmaceutical Factory—is under construction in the suburbs of Nanning. Once completed, this factory will produce various hog cholera vaccines, bacterial cultures, and serums to supply the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, aiding in the development of hog production and meeting the needs for the prevention and treatment of hog cholera.

    The factory's main buildings and auxiliary structures cover an area of over 15,000 square meters. The factory will house three main workshops: a hog cholera vaccine workshop, a disinfection workshop, and a bacterial culture workshop. Because the factory will handle bacteria and viruses during its production process, the selection of the site was very stringent, and each workshop is equipped with underground sewers for the discharge of wastewater. The wastewater will undergo a process of grease removal, clarification, acid fermentation, bleaching powder disinfection, aeration, and filtration to eliminate bacteria before being discharged. To complete such a complex wastewater treatment design, the Guangxi Provincial Design Company sent personnel to biological pharmaceutical factories in Nanjing and Wuhan in mid-January to learn advanced techniques.

    广西兴建生物药厂
    本报讯　一个现代化兽畜生物药厂——广西生物药厂，正在南宁市郊兴建中。这个厂建成以后，将生产出来各种猪瘟疫疫苗菌苗和血清等，供应广东、广西、云南、贵州四省发展毛猪生产，防止和治疗猪瘟疫的需要。
    这个厂的主要厂房和附属房屋占地面积，共有一万五千多平方公尺。厂里将设有猪瘟疫苗车间、消毒车间和菌苗车间等三个主要车间。由于这个厂将来生产过程中有细菌病毒，厂址的选择要求很严格，各个车间均设有地下水道用以排除污水。污水要经过去脂池、澄清池、酸酵池、漂白粉消毒、曝气和过滤以后，消灭掉细菌，才排除出去。为了完成这样复杂的排污设计，广西省设计公司在1月中旬曾派人到南京、武汉两地生物药厂参观，学习先进经验。　（陈庚辛）
