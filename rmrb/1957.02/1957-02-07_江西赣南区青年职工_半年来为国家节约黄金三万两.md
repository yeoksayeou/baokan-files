Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 5th. Since July 1956, young workers in the Gannan District of Jiangxi Province launched the campaign to "save 30,000 taels of gold for the socialist construction of the motherland," and to date, they have saved wealth equivalent to 32,705 taels of gold for the country.

After the Gannan District Committee of the Communist Youth League issued this call to young workers throughout the district in July 1956, more than 80% of the young workers in the district joined this meaningful activity. In the conservation effort, the young people actively put forward rationalization proposals. According to preliminary statistics from fourteen units, 2,249 rationalization proposals were put forward in half a year. Among them, 852 have been adopted and implemented, saving the country more than 157,000 yuan. A rationalization proposal put forward by Tian Jinglu, a young technician at the Shangyou Hydropower Station, saved the country 64.27 tons of angle steel. Ma Daoming and others from the Second Company of the Ninth Metallurgical Construction Corporation proposed 13 rationalization proposals in the process of reviewing drawings, saving a total of 138.87 tons of cement, 22.27 tons of steel, and 80 tons of coal, equivalent to 230 taels of gold. In addition, the young people also put forward the slogan "make the best use of big materials, make the best use of small materials, utilize waste materials, and use other materials as substitutes," and recovered a lot of waste materials, and turned many waste materials into finished products. According to statistics, the young people in the district recovered a total of 277,830 kilograms of scrap iron and steel, 300,281 cubic meters of wood, and other useful materials.

    半年来为国家节约黄金三万两
    新华社南昌5日电　江西省赣南区青年职工自1956年7月开展“为祖国社会主义建设节约三万两黄金”的活动以来，到目前已经为国家节约了折合三万二千七百零五两黄金的财富。
    青年团赣南区工作委员会在1956年7月间向全区青年职工发出这个号召以后，当时全区80％以上的青年职工投入了这一有意义的活动。在节约活动中，广大青年积极地提出合理化建议，据十四个单位的初步统计，在半年中就提出了二千二百四十九件合理化建议。其中已经被采纳实行的有八百五十二件，共为国家节约了十五万七千多元。上犹水电站青年技术员田景禄提出的一件合理化建议，就为国家节约角钢六十四点二七吨。第九冶金建筑总公司第二公司马道明等人在审核图纸的过程中提出的十三件合理化建议，共节约水泥一百三十八点八七吨、钢材二十二点二七吨、煤八十吨，折合黄金二百三十两。此外，广大青年还提出“大材大用，小材小用，废料利用，别物代用”的口号，收回了不少废料，并把不少废料变成了成品。据统计，全区青年共收回废钢铁二十七万七千八百三十公斤、木材三十万零二千零八十一立方公尺和其他有用物资。
