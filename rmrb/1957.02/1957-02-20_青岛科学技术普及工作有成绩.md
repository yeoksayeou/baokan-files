Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, February 18th: Qingdao's Science and Technology Popularization Association, in its three-year work report delivered at the Second Member Representative Assembly on the 17th, pointed out that Qingdao has achieved significant results in scientific and technological popularization work, with industrial production technology as its main focus.

　　Based on the needs of production, the association has held more than 100 systematic professional and technical lectures in over 30 categories, including "Machinery," "Textiles," "Navigation," and "Mechanical Blueprint Reading." It also organized accelerated blueprint reading courses for mechanical workers citywide. Workers generally reported that learning to read blueprints not only avoided rework and waste but also saved a significant amount of labor time.

　　In the second half of last year, many grassroots science popularization organizations in factories conducted in-depth activities in workshops, holding 3,353 lectures in the fourth quarter alone.

　　Because scientific and technological activities were closely integrated with production, the workers' interest in learning science and technology increased. Almost 100% of the workers at the Joint State-Private Qingdao Bicycle Factory participated in the learning process. Female welders also attended the "Welding" lectures organized by the factory's science popularization organization. The Qingdao Science and Technology Popularization Association now has 68 grassroots organizations and 2,266 members. A total of 306 people attended this conference.

    青岛科学技术普及工作有成绩
    据新华社青岛18日电　青岛市科学技术普及协会在17日举行的第二届会员代表大会上所作的三年工作报告中指出：青岛市以工业生产技术为主要内容的科学技术普及工作获得显著的成绩。
    根据生产的需要，这个协会三年来共举办了“机械”、“纺织”、“航海”、“机工识图”等三十多种共一百多个系统性的专业技术讲座。在全市范围内，组织机械工人的速成看图学习。工人们普遍反映：由于学会了看图，不但避免了返工浪费现象，并且还节约了大量工时。
    去年下半年，许多工厂的科普基层组织深入车间展开活动，在第四季度内，就举行了三千三百五十三次讲演。
    由于科学技术活动密切结合了生产，提高了工人学习科学技术的兴趣。公私合营青岛自行车厂的工人几乎百分之百的参加了学习。这个厂的科普组织举办的“焊接”讲座，女焊接工也参加听讲。青岛市科学技术普及协会现在已有六十八个基层组织，二千二百六十六个会员了。出席这次大会的共有三百零六人。
