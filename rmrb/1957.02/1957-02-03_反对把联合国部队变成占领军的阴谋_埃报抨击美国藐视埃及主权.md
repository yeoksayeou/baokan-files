Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 2nd: Egyptian newspapers, commenting on the UN General Assembly's discussion of Israel's refusal to withdraw from Egyptian territory, severely criticized the position taken by the U.S. delegation.

    Sadat, editor of "Al-Gomhouria," said in the newspaper on January 30, regarding Western countries' suggestion to amend the mission of the UN Emergency Force: "Egypt must never agree to allow any country, any group of countries, or even the United Nations itself to occupy Egyptian territory."

    He believes that the U.S. representative's speech was "vague and could arouse suspicion and speculation." He demanded that the United States answer directly: "Does the United States support aggression and therefore intend to pay for it? Or does it condemn it and is determined to resist it?"

    Khaled Mohieddin pointed out in "Al Masaa" on January 29 that although the U.S. representative demanded the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops, he advocated that the UN Emergency Force be stationed in the Gulf of Aqaba area and along the armistice line. This gives people the impression that the United States wants to turn the UN Emergency Force into an occupation force, regardless of whether Egypt agrees to this situation.

    He asked, why doesn't the United States demand a guarantee that there will be no further aggression against Egypt?

    反对把联合国部队变成占领军的阴谋
    埃报抨击美国藐视埃及主权
    据新华社开罗2日电　埃及报纸在评论联合国大会讨论以色列拒绝撤出埃及领土的问题时，严厉指责美国代表团所采取的立场。
    “共和国报”主编萨达特1月30日在这家报纸上谈到西方国家建议修改联合国紧急部队的任务时说：“埃及决不能同意让任何一个国家、任何一个国家集团或者甚至联合国本身来占领埃及的领土。”
    他认为美国代表的发言是“含糊的，并且可能会引起怀疑和猜测”。他要求美国直截了当地回答：“美国是否支持侵略，因而打算对它偿付报酬？还是谴责它并且决心抵抗它？”
    哈立德·毛希丁1月29日在“晚报”上指出，美国代表虽然要求以色列军队立即撤退，但是却主张联合国紧急部队驻扎在亚喀巴湾地区和停战线一带。这就给人们这样一个印象：美国想把联合国紧急部队变成一支占领军，而不顾埃及对这种情况是否同意。
    他问道，美国为什么不要求保证不再对埃及进行任何进一步的侵略呢？
