The Cause in His Later Years
If you haven't visited the home of old retired Professor Yan Ruo, you could never imagine how his bedroom is arranged.

The reporter came to the old professor's uniquely arranged bedroom. Next to the bed, a model of a machine occupied most of the desk; further along, right next to the sofa, was a workbench equipped with a small lathe and a vise, with pliers, wrenches, and other tools piled underneath. Seeing all this, one immediately understands how the old professor is spending his later years.

He was originally a professor in the Craft Department of Beijing Normal University and is now seventy-five years old. The state provides him with a monthly pension. He has a house full of children and grandchildren and lives very comfortably, but since retiring, he has refused to give up his beloved career – mechanical fabrication.

In 1951, the old professor reluctantly retired from the career he had been engaged in for more than fifty years, but after only a few months of rest at home, he became restless again. He thought: Being older, I can't work like ordinary people, but I can still be a consultant. From that time on, he started his career in his later years, first working as a consultant at a tractor station in the eastern suburbs, and later serving as a consultant for the Beijing First Local Industry Bureau. The old professor's footsteps almost covered the more than twenty factories led by this bureau. People cherished him very much, sending cars to pick him up whenever there was something to do, but he always quietly went to the factories to help the workers repair machines. The Beijing Toy Factory often received this enthusiastic guest. The old professor had a strong interest in manufacturing children's toys, and he helped the factory design movable small airplanes and small tractors.

The motherland's socialist construction and his strong sense of career were closely linked. When there weren't many consulting matters, he actively looked for things to do in society. When the Capital Theater had difficulties building a revolving stage, he first made a model and then personally drew the designs. He also went to the factory in Dalian that manufactured the revolving stage to provide guidance. A clock factory in Tianjin couldn't manufacture the small gears for a type of watch. He modified one of his small milling machines into a machine that could manufacture these small gears, sent it to the factory, and even went to Tianjin to teach the workers how to operate it.

The automatic briquette-making machine model that he recently successfully trial-produced was something he started working on after seeing an exhibition last year. He spent four months, often working ten hours a day, making the model of this machine at home. This machine can produce more than 40,000 briquettes a day, equivalent to the work of two hundred workers.

The old professor does not miss any opportunity to do work that benefits society. Once, when he went to a watch shop to repair a watch, the watch shop worker mentioned that they couldn't buy or make a certain part. After the old professor returned home, he made one on his own lathe and sent it to the watch shop.

His family and his students all advised him to rest. But the old professor said, "I love my career, and I can still do a little work for the country now."

As he saw the reporter off, he said that he was thinking about research topics for 1957. We wish the old professor greater achievements. (Xinhua News Agency)

    晚年的事业
    假如你没到过退休老教授老炎若的家，你决想像不出他的卧室是怎样布置的。
    记者来到老教授一间布置奇特的卧室。床旁边的写字台上，一台机器模型占了大半个台面；再过去，紧邻着沙发是一个工作台，上面装着一台小巧玲珑的车床，一个老虎钳，下面堆满了钳子、搬子等工具。看到这些，人们立刻就会明白，老教授是怎样在渡着他的晚年。
    他原是北京师范大学工艺系教授，今年已经七十五岁了。国家按月发给他养老金。家中儿孙满堂，生活过得很舒服，可是他退休以后却一直不肯丢下他热爱的事业——机械制作。
    1951年，老教授恋恋不舍地放下他从事了五十多年的事业退休了，可是在家只休养了几个月，就又安不下心了。他想：年纪大了，不能像一般人一样工作，当顾问总可以吧。从这时起，他又开始了他晚年的事业，先在东郊一个拖拉机站当顾问，后来又担任了北京市第一地方工业局的顾问，老教授的足迹几乎跑遍了这个局领导的二十多个工厂。人们都很爱护他，有事就派汽车来接他，可是他总是悄悄地跑到工厂去帮助工人们修理机器。北京市玩具厂常常接待这位热心的客人，老教授对制造儿童玩具有着浓厚的兴趣，他帮助工厂设计能活动的小飞机、小拖拉机。
    祖国的社会主义建设和他坚强的事业心紧紧结合在一起。当顾问的事情不多，他就主动地在社会上找一些事情做。首都剧场建转台时有了困难，他先给做了一具模型，接着又亲自画了图样，还到大连制造这个转台的工厂去指导。天津一个钟表工厂一种表的小齿轮制造不了，他把自己一个小铣床改装成能制造这种小齿轮的机器送给工厂，还到天津去教工人操作。
    最近他试制成功的自动制蜂窝煤机模型是他去年看了一个展览会以后动手做的。他花了四个月时间，常常一天工作十小时，在自己家里制成了这部机器的模型。这部机器一天可以生产四万多块蜂窝煤，等于两百个工人的工作。
    老教授不放过任何一个他能做的造福社会的工作。一次，他到表店去修表，表店的工人谈起有一个零件买不到又做不了，老教授回去以后就在自己的车床上制成了一个给表店送了去。
    他的家人和他的学生都劝他休息。可是老教授却说：“我爱我的事业，我现在还能为国家做一点工作。”
    他送记者出门的时候说，他正在想1957年的研究题目。祝老教授获得更大的成就。　（新华社）
