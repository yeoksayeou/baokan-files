Xinhua News Agency, February 12th: At a recent study session for university League cadres held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, five thousand League cadres clarified the direction of student work and the fundamental tasks of the Communist Youth League in schools. Currently, special attention should be paid to strengthening proletarian ideological education among university students.

Participants believed that the mainstream of students' thinking today is healthy, and most students' understanding of major domestic and international events is basically correct. However, some ideological problems have indeed emerged among students recently: some students lack a clear class stance, have a vague understanding of democracy and freedom, and a small number of students have not clearly distinguished between ourselves and the enemy in their thinking; some League members have a weaker sense of organization than before, and some schools have experienced a loosening of League organizational life.

The study session required League cadres to comprehensively care for the growth of students, not only to care about students' studies, but also to care about students' political consciousness and moral character. Therefore, it is very necessary to use proletarian ideology to criticize non-proletarian ideology for college students, more than 80% of whom come from non-proletarian families and have lived a life of study for a long time. In addition, attention should be paid to educating students on ideological methods. Regarding the issues of developing individuality and cultivating good willpower and character, everyone believed that it is inappropriate to present these abstract slogans lacking class content to students in isolation. The shortcomings of forcibly seeking uniformity that once occurred in extracurricular activities last year should be corrected, but this is not a directional error, but a problem of method and style, and cannot be used to negate collectivist education.

In carrying out ideological education, everyone realized that they should rely on the leadership of the Party. When conducting ideological criticism of students, the methods of enlightenment and guidance, and gentle persuasion should be used, and a cure-the-illness-save-the-patient attitude should be adopted towards those with erroneous ideas. However, it is also wrong to be afraid of criticizing erroneous ideas.

During the study and discussion process, everyone agreed that the League organization should focus on consolidation in the future, and especially pointed out that the Communist Youth League is the Party's assistant and reserve force, a political and revolutionary combat organization, not a purely cultural group. Assisting the Party in conducting political and ideological education for League members and youth is the fundamental task of the League. In the future, League members should be strictly required in accordance with the League Constitution to give play to the fighting power of the League organization.

### 加强大学生中的无产阶级思想教育  北京团市委大学团干部学习会上明确提出当前任务

    加强大学生中的无产阶级思想教育
    北京团市委大学团干部学习会上明确提出当前任务
    新华社12日讯　在青年团北京市委员会最近举办的大学团干部学习会上，五千青年团干部明确了学生工作的方针和青年团在学校中的根本任务，当前应特别注意加强大学学生中的无产阶级思想教育。
    大家认为今天学生思想的主流是健康的，大多数学生对国内外重大事件的认识，基本上也是正确的。但最近一个时期学生中确实发生了一些思想问题：有些学生缺乏明确的阶级立场，对民主自由认识不清，少数学生在思想上没有划清敌我界限；有些团员的组织观念较前薄弱，有的学校团的组织生活发生某些松懈现象。
    学习会要求青年团干部要全面关心学生的成长，不仅要关心学生的学习，还要关心学生的政治觉悟和道德品质等。因此用无产阶级思想批判非无产阶级思想，对于80％以上出身于非无产阶级的家庭又长期过着学习生活的高等学校学生是非常必要的。此外，还要注意对学生进行思想方法的教育。关于发展个性、培养良好的意志性格问题，大家认为，如对学生孤立地提出这些缺乏阶级内容的抽象口号是不妥当的。去年在课外活动中一度发生强求一致的缺点，是应该纠正的，但这并不是方针性的错误，而是方法上和作风上的问题，不能因此否定了集体主义教育。
    在进行思想教育工作中，大家认识到应该依靠党的领导。在对学生进行思想批判时，要用启发诱导、和风细雨的方法，对有错误思想的人，采用治病救人的态度。但对错误思想不敢批判也是不对的。
    在学习和讨论过程中，大家同意今后团组织以巩固为主，并特别指出，青年团是党的助手和后备军，是政治的、革命的战斗组织，不是单纯的文化团体。协助党对团员和青年进行政治思想教育是团的根本任务。今后应按照团章严格的要求团员，发挥团组织的战斗力。
