    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th. This year, the Soviet Union will further expand the exploration of oil and gas producing areas, and the amount of exploration work will increase by a quarter compared to last year.
    During exploration, the Soviet Union will more widely use geophysical prospecting methods, and a total of more than 300 seismic survey teams will work across the country. In addition, the Soviet Union is also preparing to send survey teams by ship to the Sea of Azov and the Sea of Okhotsk for exploration work, in order to discover new oil-bearing structures on the seabed here.
    In addition to continuing exploration work in well-known oil and gas producing areas such as the Urals, the Volga River Basin, the Caucasus, and Ukraine, this year the Soviet Union will pay special attention to exploration in areas where less exploration has been done in the past, such as Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Exploration work in the past few years has proved that there is great hope for discovering new oil-bearing structures in the above-mentioned Central Asian republics. In Siberia, signs of oil and gas deposits have been discovered from the Angara River basin to the west of Lake Baikal. In order to study and develop the oil and gas resources of these new areas, a branch of the All-Union Petroleum Geological Exploration Research Institute is being established in Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic. The Leningrad Geological Exploration Research Institute under the Soviet Ministry of Petroleum Industry will devote all its efforts to the study and development of gas and oil deposits in Siberia, and the institute has already established a branch in Novosibirsk.

    苏联加强石油和煤气勘探工作
    今年勘探量将增加四分之一
    特别注意探明东部地区宝藏
    新华社莫斯科11日电　今年苏联将进一步扩大石油和煤气产地的勘探工作，勘探工作量将比去年增加四分之一。
    在勘探的时候，苏联将更加广泛地采用地球物理探矿方法，总共将有三百多个地震考察队到全国各地工作。此外，苏联还准备派考察队乘轮船到亚速海和奥霍特海上进行勘探工作，以便发现这里海底的新的含油构造。
    除继续在乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域、高加索、乌克兰等著名的石油和煤气产地进行勘探工作外，今年苏联将特别注意在西伯利亚、哈萨克、以及中亚细亚的土库曼、乌兹别克和塔吉克等这样一些过去勘探较少的地区进行勘探。过去几年的勘探工作证明，在上述几个中亚细亚加盟共和国发现新的含油构造的希望很大。在西伯利亚，从安加拉河流域到贝加尔湖以西的地区已经发现有蕴藏着石油和煤气的迹象。为了研究和开发这些新地区的石油和煤气资源，乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干正在成立全苏石油地质勘探研究所的分所。苏联石油工业部所属的列宁格勒地质勘探研究所将把全部力量用在研究和开发西伯利亚的煤气和石油矿藏上面，这个研究所已经在新西伯利亚成立了它的分所。
