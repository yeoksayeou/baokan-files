    Conscientiously Checking Inventory Materials
    Tianjin Discovers Many Underreported Materials

    According to Xinhua News Agency, conscientiously checking inventory will greatly help alleviate the current tense situation of insufficient raw material supply. The recent inventory checks by relevant departments in some state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories in Tianjin fully prove this point.

    The State Statistics Bureau instructed enterprises nationwide last year to conduct a general inventory check to understand and fully utilize the role of raw materials. However, the steel inventory reported by Tianjin enterprises in October last year was only over 30,000 tons, which was obviously inconsistent with Tianjin's actual reserves.

    From January to February this year, the Ministry of Supervision, the State Economic Commission, the State Statistics Bureau, as well as the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Supervision, Planning Commission, and Statistics Bureau, selectively and with emphasis, inspected six state-owned enterprises and warehouses, six locally state-owned and joint state-private factories, and capital construction units. As a result, more than 2,000 tons of steel alone were found to have been underreported; in addition, more than 900 tons of ferrous metals, more than 50 tons of non-ferrous metals, and more than 3,700 cubic meters of timber were stockpiled.

    According to the situation of this inspection, the reasons for underreporting are mostly intentional concealment by the enterprise units. For example, the Steam Engine Manufacturing Factory had more than 400 tons of steel, 80 tons of pig iron, and 30 tons of coke. When reporting, the supply and marketing section chief of this factory only reported 197 tons of steel, 20 tons of pig iron, and 10 tons of coke. Some units even hoard materials that they do not need but are urgently needed by other production departments in warehouses and refuse to hand them over to the state for unified allocation. Some units even purchase materials that they do not need or are not urgently needed when they cannot buy the raw materials they need, in order to conduct so-called "material exchanges" with units that produce or store the raw materials they need. The First Machine Tool Factory, which only needs more than one ton of welding rods per year, purchased more than nine tons of the most scarce imported welding rods last year and used 405 kilograms to exchange for eight motors from the Engineering Machinery Factory. This is indeed very convenient for these enterprises themselves, but they do not know that the result of doing so not only prevents these urgently needed raw materials from playing their due role but also creates an artificial tension in market supply.

    Therefore, it is still necessary to shout loudly once again: Overcome departmentalism and conscientiously check the warehouse once more. Several thousand tons were found by randomly checking twelve units. Then, isn't there even more potential to be explored in the city's thousands of factories?

### 认真清查库存物资  天津市查出许多漏报材料

    认真清查库存物资
    天津市查出许多漏报材料
    据新华社讯　认真地清查一次库存，将大有助于缓和目前原材料供应不足的紧张局面。有关部门最近对天津部分国营和地方国营、公私合营工厂的库存检查结果，充分证明了这一点。
    国家统计局去年曾经指示全国企业单位普查库存，以便了解和充分发挥原材料的作用。但是天津市的企业在去年10月上报钢材库存量，仅有三万多吨，这显然同天津实有储备量的情况不相符合。
    今年1月到2月，中央监察部、国家经济委员会、国家统计局，以及天津市监察局、计划委员会和统计局，分别地有重点地抽查了六个国营企业、仓库，六个地方国营和公私合营工厂跟基本建设单位。结果，仅钢材一项即查出两千多吨没有上报；此外，还积存着九百多吨黑色金属，五十多吨有色金属，三千七百多立方公尺木材。
    根据这次检查的情况来看，少报的原因，大多是企业单位有意的隐瞒。如蒸汽机制造厂有钢材四百多吨，生铁八十吨，焦炭三十吨，在查报的时候，这个厂的供销科长只报了钢材一百九十七吨、生铁二十吨、焦炭十吨。有些单位甚至把自己并不需要而为其他生产部门所急需的材料积压在仓库里不交给国家统一调拨。有些单位，甚至在买不到自己所需要的原材料时，就购储自己并不需要或者不急需的材料，以便向生产或储有它所需的原材料的单位进行所谓“物资交换”。一年仅需用一吨多电焊条的第一机床厂，却在去年陆续买进了最缺的九吨多进口电焊条，用了四百零五公斤同工程机械厂交换了八台马达。这对于这些企业本身来说，的确是很方便的，但是他们不知道：这样做的结果，不仅使这些急需的原料不能发挥其应有的作用，而且造成了人为的市场供应紧张。
    因此，还有必要再一次大声疾呼：克服本位主义思想，认真地清查一次仓库。抽查了十二个单位就查出了几千吨，那么，全市几千个工厂，不是更大有文章可作吗？
