    According to "People's Railway" news: The six major trunk lines from Golmud to Lhasa, Chengdu to Xichang, Kunming to Hekou, Mangnai to Ruoqiang, and the five dedicated lines from Kunming to Yimen, Chengdu to Wenchuan, etc., are undergoing comprehensive aerial surveying. It is planned to complete 4,148 kilometers within 1957.
    The formal use of aerial surveying on China's railways began in August of last year. In the past six months, approximately 3,500 kilometers of the Xi'an to Wuwei, Xining to Mangnai, and Xi'an to Hankou trunk lines have been surveyed. Using aerial surveying can reduce the heavy workload of topographic surveying and mapping, eliminate the preliminary surveying stage, and is estimated to save 20% to 30% of the workload of route surveying.
    On the 1,330-kilometer Golmud to Lhasa line being aerially surveyed, radio leveling instruments will also be used for leveling. This is because the line must pass through the Tanggula Mountains, the terrain along the route is very high, the population is sparse, and transportation is extremely difficult. At the same time, there are no maps available for reference, and there is no basis for route selection. Using radio leveling can solve these problems. Radio leveling is a new Soviet technology. Using it for measurement, once the aerial photography is completed, ground control measurements are not necessary, and small-scale topographic maps can be directly compiled. When carrying out this work, in addition to sending surveying experts, the Soviet Ministry of Transportation also sent two academicians from the Academy of Sciences to specifically assist us in scientific research.
    Currently, 91 Soviet experts, 2 experts from the German Democratic Republic, and 200 Chinese engineers and surveyors are working together, organized into two professional teams. One team is based in Lanzhou, and the other is based in Kunming. The Soviet experts stated: They must teach all aerial surveying techniques to the Chinese comrades without reservation. At present, under the guidance of experts, one-third of the field surveyors can work independently, and the cartographers have been able to create maps independently. (Attached picture)

### 通往拉萨的铁路线开始航测  全国今年计划航测铁路线四千多公里

    通往拉萨的铁路线开始航测
    全国今年计划航测铁路线四千多公里
    据“人民铁道”讯　噶尔穆到拉萨，成都到西昌，昆明到河口，茫崖到婼羌等六大干线，和昆明到易门，成都到汶川等五条专用线，正在全面进行航空测量。计划1957年内要完成四千一百四十八公里。
    在我国铁路上正式运用航空测量，是去年8月份开始的。半年来勘察了西安到武威、西宁到茫崖、西安到汉口三条干线约三千五百公里。采用航空测量，可以减少繁重的地形勘测工作量，省去草测阶段，估计节省线路勘测工作量20％到30％左右。
    在航测噶尔穆到拉萨一千三百三十公里的线路上，还将运用无线电抄平仪来抄平，因为这条线路要经过唐古拉山，沿线地势很高，人烟稀少，交通极感困难；同时，也没有图可作参考，选线无根据。采用无线电抄平仪抄平就可以解决这些问题。无线电抄平是苏联的新技术，用它测量，空中摄影完了，可以不做地面控制测量，就能直接编制小比例尺的地形图。在进行这项工作时，苏联交通部除派来了测量专家，科学院还派来了两位院士，具体帮助我们进行科学研究工作。
    现在，九十一位苏联专家、两位民主德国的专家和二百名中国工程师、测工配合，组织了两个专业队。两个队一个基地在兰州，一个基地在昆明。苏联专家表示：一定要把全部航测技术，毫不保留地教会中国同志。目前，在专家指导下，外业测量人员已有三分之一可以独立工作，内业制图人员已经能够独立制图。（附图片）
