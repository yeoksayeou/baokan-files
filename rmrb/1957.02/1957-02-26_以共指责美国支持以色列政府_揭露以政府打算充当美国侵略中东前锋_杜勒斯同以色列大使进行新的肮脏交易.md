Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: According to TASS, Tel Aviv, February 24th: "People's Voice" published a resolution of the Political Bureau of the Israeli Communist Party, which pointed out that the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" aims to establish complete American rule in the Middle East by all means, including military intervention, and to turn the Middle East into an American base for aggression.

    The resolution said: "If it were not for the support of the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, the Ben-Gurion government would not delay withdrawing its troops from the Egyptian territories it occupies." The resolution pointed out that the Ben-Gurion government intends to serve as the vanguard of American colonialists' plans for aggression in the Middle East and suggested concluding an agreement with the American government that would make Israel a country protected by the American fleet. The American fleet, under the pretext of ensuring freedom of navigation for Israel, will maintain permanent tension in the region. In addition, the Ben-Gurion government also demanded that the United Nations armed forces be turned into occupation forces, which proves that it intends to deepen the gap between Israel and the Arab countries.

    The Political Bureau of the Israeli Communist Party exposed the duplicitous policy of the American government. It said that the American government is afraid that its conspiracy to collude with the Ben-Gurion government against the independence of the people of the Middle East and Near East countries will be exposed. The resolution said: "The negotiations between the American government and Israel do not contradict the fact that there is collusion between the two governments. The purpose of this negotiation is to discuss methods for implementing the Eisenhower Plan."

    The resolution called on the masses to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip and the Sharm el-Sheikh area.

    The resolution pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposal to strengthen peace and security in the Middle East and Near East is in line with the national interests of the people of all countries in the region.

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: Washington News: US Secretary of State Dulles held talks on the 24th with Israeli Ambassador to the US, Eban, who had just returned to the United States from Israel, to discuss the conditions for Israel's withdrawal. Sources said that Eban had brought back a new proposal on Israel's withdrawal that was "not very far" from the American proposal and was ordered to avoid a "break" with the United States as much as possible.

    After the meeting, Dulles and Eban issued a joint statement saying that during the meeting, Eban presented the Israeli government's position on the withdrawal issue to Dulles. Dulles clarified several aspects of the United States' attitude and intentions on this issue. The Israeli ambassador will immediately convey the content of the meeting to the Israeli government and maintain close contact with the US State Department.

    以共指责美国支持以色列政府
    揭露以政府打算充当美国侵略中东前锋
    杜勒斯同以色列大使进行新的肮脏交易
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫24日讯：“人民呼声报”刊载了以色列共产党政治局的决议，决议指出所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的目的是用包括军事干涉在内的一切办法在中东建立美国的完全统治，并且把中东变成美国的侵略基地。
    决议说：“如果不是帝国主义者的支持，首先是美国帝国主义者的支持，本—古里安政府不会迟迟不把自己军队撤出被它占领的埃及领土。”决议指出，本—古里安政府打算充作美国殖民主义者对中东侵略计划的前锋，并且建议同美国政府缔结一项使以色列成为一个受美国舰队保护的国家的协定。美国舰队借口保障以色列的通航自由将在这一地区保持永久的紧张局势。此外，本—古里安政府，还要求把联合国武装部队变成占领军，这证明它打算使以色列同阿拉伯国家之间的鸿沟加深。
    以色列共产党政治局揭露了美国政府的两面性政策。它说，美国政府害怕自己同本—古里安政府勾结起来反对中近东各国人民的独立的阴谋被揭破。决议说：“美国政府同以色列的谈判与两国政府之间有勾结这一事实不矛盾，这一谈判的目的是讨论推行艾森豪威尔计划的方法”。
    决议号召人民群众要求以色列军队立刻无条件地从加沙地带和沙姆沙伊赫地区撤退。
    决议指出，苏联提出的关于加强中近东的和平和安全的建议符合这一地区各国人民的民族利益。
    据新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯24日同刚刚从以色列返回美国的以色列驻美大使伊班进行会谈，讨论以色列的撤军条件问题。有消息说，伊班已经带回来一个关于以色列撤军问题的同美国的建议“相差并不很远”的新建议，并且奉命尽可能避免同美国“决裂”。
    在会谈后，杜勒斯和伊班发表一个联合声明说，在会谈中，伊班向杜勒斯陈述了以色列政府在撤军问题上的立场。杜勒斯则澄清了美国在这个问题上的态度和意图的若干方面。以色列大使将马上把会谈内容转达以色列政府，并且同美国国务院保持密切的接触。
