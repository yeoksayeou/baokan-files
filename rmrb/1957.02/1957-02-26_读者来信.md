    Coal at Huangshiban Mine Urgently Needs to be Shipped
    In mid-January, the State Council issued an urgent telegram requiring Shanxi Province to overfulfill its coal transportation plan by more than 100,000 tons in the short term. Among them, more than 80,000 tons were allocated to the Yangquan Mining Bureau for external transportation, because this bureau had the largest coal reserves in the Shanxi area. According to a joint working group organized by the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee, the Yangquan Mining Bureau's coal reserves are mainly concentrated in the First Mine - Huangshiban Mine. This mine currently has a coal inventory of more than 90,000 tons. From a quantitative point of view, completing the state's task is more than sufficient. However, Huangshiban Mine will not only be unable to overfulfill its coal transportation plan in February, but may not even be able to complete the plan.
    The coal is there, but it cannot be transported out. The reason is the disconnection between production and sales. This mine began production at the end of the second quarter of last year, but the railway special line for coal transportation was not completed and put into use until November. The coal produced in the past six months has not been shipped out in a timely manner. At the same time, since the production department only took care of getting the coal out of the pit entrance at that time, the coal pile is now 300-400 meters away from the loading point on the special line, so it has to be transported again by manpower using small flat cars. As a result, only 500-600 tons can be transported out on average every day. If this continues, it will take five months to transport out only the 90,000 tons of coal in stock. What about the coal produced in these five months? Although they have taken some measures, the problem has not yet been solved.
    The country urgently needs coal, but Huangshiban Mine has coal but cannot transport it out. Moreover, this coal has been stored for half a year, and the temperature of the coal pile has reached as high as 90 degrees Celsius, posing a risk of spontaneous combustion (generally, coal piles will spontaneously combust when the temperature reaches above 100 degrees Celsius). It is hoped that the relevant leading departments will quickly find ways to solve the transportation difficulties and rush to transport this coal out.

    Tianhe Coal Mine Has a Lot of Coal in Stock
    At a time when coal supply is relatively tight, the four coal yards of Tianhe Coal Mine in Jiangxi Province are stockpiling more than 28,000 tons of coal. These four coal yards are all located on the edges of ditches and rivers, and the coal will be washed away once the spring rains arrive. Relevant departments should quickly organize transportation forces to transport this coal out to support industrial construction!

    Some Ceramic Factories in Tangshan Waste Coal
    In the process of firing ceramics, some ceramic factories in Tangshan waste coal to a certain extent due to poor management and low coal burning technology. For example, in the ash residue discarded by the Deshunlong Pottery Factory's pit and kiln, combustible coke accounts for more than 10%. The temperature of the Gongshunhe Pottery Factory's pottery pipe pit should be between 80 and 85 degrees Celsius, but they often burn it to 100 degrees Celsius, which not only wastes coal, but also often bakes the semi-finished products due to the excessive temperature. The Jianhua Ceramic Factory's drying room is poorly managed, and the temperature often exceeds the specified 90 degrees Celsius, sometimes reaching as high as 120 degrees Celsius. Because the temperature is too high, they are afraid of baking the semi-finished products, so they open the windows of the drying room to dissipate heat, which naturally wastes a lot of coal.
    All factories should quickly eliminate the phenomenon of waste.
                          Li Wanzhou

    The Bad Consequences of Having Too Many Management Personnel
    The Shijiazhuang Joint Public-Private Xinde Electrochemical Plant mainly produces calcium carbide. The raw materials used, quicklime and coke, are all locally sourced, and there is no shortage of quantity. The power source is electricity, the equipment is modern, and there is no problem with product sales. It stands to reason that with such superior production conditions, it should be possible to do a good job in production and accumulate some wealth for the country! However, this factory lost 15,044 yuan in 1956.
    What is the reason for the loss of money? The main reason is that the factory's administrative structure is huge and there are too many non-production personnel. Last year, the factory's enterprise management expenses exceeded the budget by 6,494 yuan, exceeding the plan by 31%, accounting for 43.17% of the total loss.
    This factory has 15 workers, but there are 18 functional personnel. The number of staff accounts for 120% of the number of workers. In other words, 1.2 staff members manage the production of one worker. Among these functional personnel, there are five factory directors, with each director managing an average of three workers.
    So many management personnel have not managed production well, but have caused waste!

    黄石板矿的煤急待抢运
    1月中旬，国务院曾以急电要求山西省在短期内超计划多运出十几万吨煤。其中有八万多吨分配由阳泉矿务局外运，因为这个局的存煤在山西地区是最多的。经山西省人民委员会组织的联合工作组了解，阳泉矿务局的存煤主要集中在第一矿——黄石板矿。这个矿现在存煤九万多吨。从数量上看，完成国家任务是绰绰有余的。但是，黄石板矿的存煤在2月份不但不能超计划多运，而且可能连计划也完不成。
    煤是有，就是运不出来。原因是生产和运销之间脱了节。这个矿去年第二季度末就开始生产了，但是运煤用的铁路专用线，直到11月份才修通使用。半年来生产的煤，都没有及时外运。同时，由于当时生产部门只把煤弄出坑口就不管了，现在存煤堆距离专用线装车地点还有三、四百公尺，只好再用人力小平车搬运一道，结果平均每天只能运出五、六百吨。要是这样下去，仅是九万吨存煤，就要用五个月的时间才能运完，这五个月生产出来的煤又怎么办呢？虽然他们采取了些措施，但还没解决问题。
    国家急需要煤，黄石板矿有煤却运不出来。而且，这些煤已经存放半年之久，煤堆温度已经高达九十度，有自燃的危险（一般的煤堆，温度到一百度以上就要自燃）。希望有关领导部门赶快设法解决运输上的困难，把这些煤抢运出去。
                          周振华
    天河煤矿存煤多
    在目前煤炭供应比较紧张的时候，江西省天河煤矿的四个煤场里，却积压着二万八千多吨煤。这四个煤场都在沟边和河边，一旦春雨到来，煤就会被冲走。有关部门赶快组织运输力量，把这些煤运出去支援工业建设吧！　　　　周文善
    唐山部分陶瓷厂浪费煤
    唐山一些陶瓷厂在烧炼陶瓷的过程中，由于管理不善，烧煤技术不高，存在着一定程度的浪费煤的现象。像德顺隆窑业厂地坑和窑炉扔掉的灰渣中，可燃焦炭就占10％以上。公顺合窑业厂陶管地坑的温度，以摄氏八十到八十五度为宜，但是他们经常烧到一百度，不仅浪费了煤，而且由于温度过高，常把半成品烤坏。建华陶瓷厂干燥室管理不善，温度也时常超过规定的九十度，有时还高达一百二十度；因为温度过高，怕把半成品烤坏，他们就把干燥室的窗户打开来散热，这样自然也浪费了不少煤炭。
    各厂应迅速杜绝浪费现象。
                          李万周
    管理人员过多的恶果
    石家庄市公私合营信德电化厂主要生产电石，所用的原材料生石灰、焦炭都是就地取材，数量不缺，动力是电，设备是现代化的，产品销路更不成问题。按说，生产条件如此优越，应该能搞好生产，为国家积累些财富了吧！这个厂在1956年却赔了一万五千零四十四元。
    赔钱的原因何在呢？主要是这个厂行政机构庞大，非生产人员过多。去年，这个厂的企业管理费超支六千四百九十四元，超计划31％，占赔钱总数的43.17％。
    这个厂有十五个工人，职能人员却有十八个，职员数量占工人数量的120％。也就是说，一点二个职员管理一个工人的生产。这些职能人员中，有五个厂长，平均每个厂长管三个工人。
    这么多管理人员却没有把生产管好，反而造成了浪费！　林莉
