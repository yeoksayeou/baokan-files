Xinhua News Agency, February 21st. The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a circular to its local organizations at all levels on February 19th, calling on all members to actively subscribe to the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds and to play a backbone and leading role in the industrial and commercial circles.

The circular pointed out: Over the past year, the organization of the China Democratic National Construction Association has developed vigorously, and the number of members has increased significantly, with industrial and commercial members accounting for a very large proportion. In this promotion of the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds, organizations at all levels should further stimulate their patriotic enthusiasm and actively subscribe under the principle of acting according to their capacity and on a voluntary basis, so as to actively support national economic construction. The circular requires that the focus of promotion work by organizations at all levels should be on promoting subscriptions from large industrialists and businessmen members who receive more fixed interest. In addition to calling on them to actively subscribe, they are also required to play a backbone and leading role among the industrial and commercial masses they are in contact with. In the course of publicity and mobilization, it is necessary to deeply understand the members' opinions on subscribing to government bonds and do a good job in ideological education for the members in a timely manner. Members who perform actively should be commended in appropriate ways.

    民主建国会号召全体会员踊跃认购公债
    新华社21日讯　中国民主建国会中央常务委员会于2月19日对所属各级地方组织发出通函，号召全体会员踊跃认购1957年国家经济建设公债，并在工商界中发挥骨干、带头作用。
    通函指出：一年以来，中国民主建国会的组织有了蓬勃发展，会员人数增加很多，其中工商业者会员占着极大的比重。在这次推销1957年国家经济建设公债工作中，各级组织应该进一步启发他们的爱国热情，在量力自愿的原则下踊跃认购，来积极支援国家经济建设。通函要求各级组织推销工作的重点要放在推动收取定息较多的大工商业者会员方面，除号召他们积极认购而外，还要求他们在所联系的工商界群众当中起骨干、带头作用。在进行宣传和动员当中，要深入了解会员对于认购公债的意见，及时向会员作好思想教育工作。对于表现积极的会员，应采取适当方式给以表扬。
