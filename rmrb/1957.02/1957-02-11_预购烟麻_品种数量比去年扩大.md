Xinhua News Agency, 10th. This year, the varieties and quantities of tobacco and hemp pre-purchased by the state have been expanded compared to last year. Except for sun-cured tobacco, where only a portion produced in Guangdong is pre-purchased, all other varieties are pre-purchased according to the state procurement plan.

The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the People's Bank of China recently issued a notice on expanding the pre-purchase of tobacco and hemp in 1957. The notice stated that, in order to further promote the development of tobacco and hemp production and closely integrate agricultural production plans with state procurement plans, in addition to continuing to pre-purchase flue-cured tobacco and ramie, pre-purchases will also be made for hemp, jute, kenaf, sisal hemp, and some famous sun-cured tobacco in Guangdong. It has been decided to pre-purchase the entire commodity volume of flue-cured tobacco, and various types of hemp will be pre-purchased in accordance with the state procurement plan. Sun-cured tobacco will only be pre-purchased from some counties in Guangdong such as Nanxiong, Lianjiang, Heshan, and Xinhui.

The notice stated that, in order to assist farmers in overcoming difficulties in production and livelihood, a certain amount of deposit will be paid at the time of pre-purchase, according to different varieties and in accordance with the prescribed proportions, without interest. As the total amount of pre-purchase deposits invested by the state this year is much larger than last year, all regions are required to assist agricultural cooperatives in making comprehensive arrangements for the use of deposits, taking into account both the needs of production investment and the difficulties in the lives of members.

The notice requires purchasing departments in all regions to closely liaise with relevant units and, based on actual needs and the amount that can be supplied, sign combined contracts or issue supply vouchers for fertilizers and coal used for initial curing of flue-cured tobacco, to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production, ensure the realization of tobacco and hemp production increase plans, and improve quality.

In order to ensure that pre-purchase is based on a reliable foundation, the notice also requires that pre-purchase contracts in all regions must be discussed and approved by the general meeting of agricultural cooperative members or the meeting of members' representatives, to prevent the pre-purchase quantity from being too high or too low and deviating from reality. At the same time, after the tobacco and hemp are sown and emerge, a comprehensive review must be carried out to verify the planting area. In addition, in order not to delay the farming season, all regions are required to seize the time to arrange and basically complete the signing of pre-purchase contracts before sowing, according to the different sowing times.

    预购烟麻
    品种数量比去年扩大
    新华社10日讯　今年国家预购烟麻的品种和数量都比去年扩大。除了晒烟只预购广东生产的一部分外，其余品种均按照国家采购计划全部进行预购。
    中华全国供销合作总社和中国人民银行日前发出了关于1957年扩大烟麻预购的通知。通知说，为了进一步促进烟麻生产的发展，使农业生产计划与国家采购计划密切结合，今年除了继续预购烤烟、苎麻外，并对大麻、黄麻、苘麻、龙舌兰麻及广东部分名晒烟进行预购。对烤烟决定预购其全部商品量，各种麻类根据国家采购计划全部进行预购，晒烟只对广东省南雄、廉江、鹤山、新会等县部分进行预购。
    通知说，为了协助农民克服生产和生活上的困难，预购时，分别不同品种，按照规定的比例，付给一定数量的定金，不计利息。由于今年国家投放预购定金总数量比去年增加很大，要求各地应协助农业社对定金使用作好全面安排，既要照顾生产投资的需要，又要兼顾社员生活上的困难。
    通知要求各地采购部门密切联系有关单位，对烟麻生产所需肥料和烤烟初烤用煤应根据实际需要及可能供应数量，签定结合合同或发给供应凭证，给予供应，以鼓励农民增产的积极性，保证烟麻增产计划的实现，提高品质。
    为了使预购建立在可靠的基础上，通知还要求各地预购合同必须经农业社社员大会或社员代表会讨论通过，以防止预购数量偏高偏低，脱离实际。同时在烟麻播种出苗后必须全面进行复查，核实种植面积。另外，为了不误农时，并要求各地抓紧布置，根据播种时间的不同，于播种前基本完成预购合同的签定工作。
