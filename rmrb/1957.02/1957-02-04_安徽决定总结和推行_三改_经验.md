    Anhui Decides to Summarize and Promote the "Three Reforms" Experience
    (Our report) The Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture recently convened a meeting of the directors of the agricultural bureaus of special districts and cities throughout the province. The meeting believed that in order to complete the province's task of producing 27.9 billion catties of grain this year, striving to produce 28.8 billion catties, the main focus should be on the cooperatives, conscientiously summarizing the experience of the "Three Reforms," continuing to comprehensively understand and implement the "Three Reforms" methods, increasing the multiple cropping index, protecting and enhancing the enthusiasm for agricultural production, overcoming conservative thinking and negative emotions, and boldly, actively, and methodically promoting various yield-increasing measures and high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and Victory No. 100 sweet potato, adapting to local conditions and seasons. It is also important to do a good job in technical training and guidance, accumulate and apply sufficient fertilizer, and increase the yield per unit area. In terms of technical promotion and production reform, the meeting believed that all successful methods must be adhered to and actively promoted in areas with similar conditions; all failures must have the reasons clarified, lessons learned, and not be repeated; some methods that are still between success and failure or have complex reasons that are difficult to confirm for the time being should continue to be tested on a small scale. In the future, all excellent varieties introduced from other places must be subjected to careful testing with a small area and multiple points, and then the results of the test will determine whether they can be widely promoted.

    安徽决定总结和推行“三改”经验
    本报讯　安徽省农业厅最近召开了全省专区、市农业局长会议。会议认为，要完成全省今年生产二百七十九亿斤争取生产二百八十八亿斤粮食的任务，主要的应以合作社为中心，认真总结“三改”经验，继续全面地理解和执行“三改”办法，提高复种指数，保护和提高农业生产的积极性，克服保守思想和消极情绪，因时因地地、大胆地、积极地、有阵地地推广各种增产措施和水稻、玉米、胜利百号甘薯等各种高产作物，搞好技术传授和指导工作，积足施好肥料，提高单位面积产量。在技术推广和生产改革方面，会议认为凡是成功的必须坚持，并且在条件相同的地区积极推广；凡是失败的必须弄清原因，吸取教训，不再重复；有些尚在成败之间的或原因复杂一时难以肯定的，要继续在小范围内试验。今后凡从外地引进的优良品种，要进行面积小点多的慎重试验，然后视试验结果决定是否可以大量推广。
