    The United Nations Has a Responsibility to Support the National Demands of the Algerian People
    The discussion on the Algerian question in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has concluded, and now this issue will be submitted to the General Assembly plenary session for discussion.
    During the nine days of discussion in the Political Committee, the representatives of most Asian and African countries, as well as socialist countries and some Latin American and European countries, in their speeches advocated that the United Nations should uphold justice and safeguard the right of self-determination of the Algerian people. However, colonialist countries such as France, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and their followers, have tried their best to defend France's colonial suppression policy in Algeria and resolutely opposed the United Nations from assuming its responsibilities under the Charter to intervene in this issue, which concerns the right to self-determination of a nation and international peace.
    During the voting, the simple majority gathered by the colonialist countries rejected the reasonable proposal put forward by eighteen Asian and African countries to promote a just resolution of the Algerian question. The Political Committee adopted a proposal instigated by the United States and supported by the United States. This proposal vaguely expressed the hope that the Algerian question could achieve a "peaceful and democratic" solution, but did not mention a single word about the substance of the Algerian question or the means of resolution. The Political Committee passed another proposal put forward by Japan, Thailand, and the Philippines, which generally expressed the hope that France would try to resolve the Algerian question with the Algerian people through appropriate negotiations in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, but it also avoided the main issue of recognizing the Algerian people's right to self-determination. No wonder the French delegation officials said triumphantly after the vote, "Neither of the two resolutions passed by the committee requires France to take any specific measures."
    As early as the beginning of the discussion, French Foreign Minister Pineau opposed voting on the suggestions regarding the Algerian question. According to him: The Algerian question is France's internal affair, and the United Nations has no right to interfere. He also insisted that the Algerian people's anti-colonialist armed uprising was the trouble-making of a few "terrorists," due to the "incitement" of "Arab imperialism" and the "infiltration" of communism.
    Pineau's statement is completely without factual basis. Even French Prime Minister Mollet, when he first took office, said: "Based on the fact that there are eight million Muslims living in Algeria, that country cannot be considered a province of France like, for example, Normandy or Artois." Long before France invaded North Africa, Algeria had diplomatic relations with other countries and was recognized as an independent country. For one hundred and twenty-six years, the Algerian people have stepped into the breach and carried out heroic struggles to oppose French colonial enslavement and strive for national independence. In particular, the large-scale armed uprising since 1954 has demonstrated the determination and will of the Algerian people to strive for national independence.
    The Algerian people's anti-French struggle has the distinct nature of an anti-colonialist national liberation struggle. The Algerian people took up arms to resist the French colonialists because they could not endure the miserable life of colonial slaves. Under France's long-term colonial rule, Algeria has become a hell on earth. According to calculations by French experts, the Algerian people can only obtain half of the normal required amount of food. Twenty-five thousand colonists occupy most of Algeria's land and agricultural products; while the majority of Algerian residents are ragged, living in overcrowded housing, there are more than 400,000 tuberculosis patients, the number of unemployed often reaches one million, the infant mortality rate is as high as 18%, and illiteracy accounts for 90% of the population…. The reason why the Algerian people want to hold armed uprisings is to jump out of this dark hell of colonial oppression. Therefore, to describe this national liberation struggle as the trouble-making of a few "terrorists," as the "incitement" of "Arab imperialism" and the "infiltration" of communism, is nothing more than an attempt to confuse the public and conceal the barbaric nature of the colonial repression policy adopted by France in Algeria.
    It is worth pointing out that the United States, which claims to be anti-colonialist, is actually a staunch protector of colonialism. U.S. Representative Lodge praised France's plan in the Political Committee, demanding that the Algerian people accept a "ceasefire without any preconditions," and then conduct "free elections" to elect representatives to negotiate the issue of Algeria's status with France. Many representatives of Asian and African countries pointed out that the so-called "without any preconditions" means refusing to recognize the fundamental issue of the Algerian people's right to self-determination. If the Algerian armed forces accept this ceasefire without any political guarantees, the French government will disarm them, throw a large number of insurgents into prison, and use manipulative elections to keep Algeria still in the shackles of French colonial rule.
    The United States opposes the United Nations making any practically meaningful decisions on the Algerian question, which is actual support for France's colonial repression policy. No wonder Pineau spoke immediately after the voting in the Political Committee to "thank the United States for its support." In fact, the United States has always supported France's colonial repression policy against the Algerian people. The United States has continuously supplied France with weapons to slaughter Algerians through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the United States has always used US dollars to subsidize the French government's huge war expenses to support their colonial war policy against the Algerian people.
    Now is the time to recognize the Algerian people's right to national self-determination. If the French colonialists do not pull back from the brink, they can only put France in a more unfavorable position, and they can only allow a larger and larger bloody war to continue, thereby creating a threat to international peace. Stopping the atrocities of colonialism, satisfying the national aspirations of the Algerian people, and maintaining peace are not only the rights of the United Nations, but also the obligations of the United Nations.

### 联合国有责任支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族要求

    联合国有责任支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族要求
    联合国大会政治委员会关于阿尔及利亚问题的讨论已经结束，现在这个问题将提到大会全体会议上进行讨论。
    在政治委员会九天的讨论中，大多数亚非国家的代表以及社会主义国家和一部分拉丁美洲和欧洲的国家的代表，在发言中都主张联合国应当主持正义，维护阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利。而法国、美国、英国等殖民主义国家和它们的追随者，却竭力为法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民镇压政策辩护，并且坚决反对联合国负起宪章所规定的责任，干预这个关系到一个民族的自决权利和国际和平的问题。
    在表决的时候，殖民主义国家纠集的简单的多数否决了十八个亚非国家所提出的促使阿尔及利亚问题得到公正解决的合理提案。政治委员会通过了一项由美国授意并在美国支持下提出的提案。这项提案不着边际地表示希望阿尔及利亚问题能够获得一个“和平的和民主的”解决，而对阿尔及利亚问题的实质和解决途径一字不提。政治委员会通过的另一项由日本、泰国和菲律宾提出的提案，虽然一般地表示希望法国设法和阿尔及利亚人民通过适当的谈判，按照联合国宪章的原则来解决阿尔及利亚问题，但是也避开了承认阿尔及利亚人民自决权这个主要问题。难怪法国代表团人士在表决结束后要得意地说，“委员会通过的两项决议都没有要求法国采取任何具体措施”。
    早在讨论开始时，法国外交部长比诺就反对就阿尔及利亚问题的建议进行表决。据他说：阿尔及利亚问题是法国的内部问题，联合国无权过问。他还把阿尔及利亚人民的反殖民主义武装起义硬说成是少数“恐怖分子”的捣乱，是由于“阿拉伯帝国主义”的“煽动”和共产主义的“渗入”。
    比诺的这种发言是毫无事实根据的。连法国总理摩勒在他刚上任的时候都说过：“按照有八百万伊斯兰教徒居住在阿尔及利亚的事实，那个国家不能像例如诺曼底或阿多瓦之类被认为是法国的一省。”早在法国侵入北非以前，阿尔及利亚就同其它国家有过外交关系，并且被承认是一个独立国家。一百二十六年来，阿尔及利亚人民曾前仆后继地为反对法国的殖民奴役和争取民族独立而进行了英勇的斗争。特别是1954年以来大规模的武装起义，表现了阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族独立的决心和意志。
    阿尔及利亚人民的反法斗争，具有显明的反殖民主义民族解放斗争的性质。阿尔及利亚人民拿起武器来反抗法国殖民主义者，是因为他们不能忍受殖民地奴隶的悲惨生活。在法国的长期殖民统治之下，阿尔及利亚变成了人间地狱。据法国专家计算，阿尔及利亚人民只能得到的粮食正常需要量的一半。二万五千个殖民者占有着阿尔及利亚土地和农产物的大部分；而大部分阿尔及利亚居民却是衣衫褴褛，住房拥挤不堪，肺病患者有四十多万，失业人数经常有一百万，儿童死亡率高达18％，文盲占人口的90％……。阿尔及利亚人民所以要举行武装起义，就是要跳出这个殖民压迫的黑暗地狱。因此要把这种民族解放斗争说成是少数“恐怖分子”的捣乱，说成是“阿拉伯帝国主义”的“煽动”和共产主义的“渗入”，不过是企图混淆视听，掩饰法国在阿尔及利亚采取的殖民镇压政策的野蛮性质而已。
    值得指出的是，自称为反殖民主义者的美国，实际上是殖民主义的坚决保护人。美国代表洛奇在政治委员会上极力称赞法国的计划，要阿尔及利亚人民接受“不附任何先决条件的停火”，然后进行“自由选举”选出代表，同法国谈判阿尔及利亚的地位问题。很多亚非国家的代表指出：所谓“不附任何先决条件”，就是拒绝承认阿尔及利亚人民有自决权利这个根本问题。如果阿尔及利亚武装部队接受这种没有任何政治保证的停火，法国政府就会解除他们的武装，把大批起义者投入监狱，并且用操纵选举的办法，把阿尔及利亚仍然留在法国殖民统治的镣铐下。
    美国反对联合国对阿尔及利亚问题作出任何有实际意义的决定，这就是对法国的殖民镇压政策的实际支持。无怪乎比诺要在政治委员会表决结束以后马上发言“感谢美国的支持”。其实，美国曾一直支持法国对阿尔及利亚人民的殖民镇压政策。美国曾通过北大西洋公约组织源源不断地供给法国以屠杀阿尔及利亚人的武器，美国曾一直用美元来贴补法国政府庞大的战费，来支持他们对阿尔及利亚人民的殖民战争政策。
    现在是承认阿尔及利亚人民的民族自决权利的时候了。法国殖民者如果还不悬崖勒马，就只能使法国处于更加不利的地位，就只能让一场规模愈来愈大的流血的战争继续下去，从而造成对国际和平的威胁。制止殖民主义的暴行，满足阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望和维护和平，这不但是联合国的权利，而且是联合国的义务。
