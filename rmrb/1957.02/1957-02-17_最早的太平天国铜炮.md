The earliest copper cannon made by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was recently discovered in Hupu Town, Changshu County. It is the earliest cast copper cannon of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom discovered so far, making it extremely precious. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Memorial Hall will send personnel to Hupu to transport this copper cannon to Nanjing for preservation.

Hupu Town is more than forty miles northeast of Changshu County, and is an important town along the Yangtze River. During the period when the Taiping Army occupied Changshu from September 1860 to January 1863, the important riverside towns of Fushan, Hupu, and Baimao (all within Changshu County) were heavily defended. In January 1863, due to the betrayal and surrender to the Qing Dynasty by Luo Guozhong and Dong Zhengqin, subordinates of Qian Guiren, the main general of the Taiping Army, Changshu and Zhaowen counties (now combined into Changshu County) and the towns along the river fell into the hands of the Qing army. It is presumed that this cannon was left behind by the Taiping Army that defended Hupu at that time. The cannon's body is complete and intact, with a thirteen-character inscription in lightly engraved flying white regular script: "Weight 200 catties, made in the sixth year of Bingchen (i.e., 1856 AD), powder ten taels." (The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom called gunpowder "powder," and "powder ten taels" indicates that this cannon could hold ten taels of gunpowder.)

Currently, four copper cannons of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom cast in the eleventh year of Xinyou (1861 AD) have been discovered (found in Anhui), one cast in the thirteenth year of Guihai (1863 AD) (found in Nanjing), and one cast in the seventh year of Ding Si (1857 AD) (found in Suzhou).

    最早的太平天国铜炮
    太平天国丙辰六年置造的一门铜炮最近在常熟县浒浦镇发现，这是目前已发现的太平天国铜炮中，铸造年份最早的一门，极为珍贵。太平天国纪念馆即将派人前往浒浦将这门铜炮运到南京保存。
    浒浦镇在常熟县城东北四十多里地，是沿长江的一个重要镇市。1860年9月到1863年1月太平军占领常熟期间，沿江重镇福山、浒浦、白茆（都在常熟县境内）都是防守重地。1863年1月，因太平军主将钱桂仁部将骆国忠、董正勤等背叛降清，常熟、昭文二县（现合为常熟县）和沿江各镇才沦入清军之手。这门炮推断是当年防守浒浦的太平军遗留下来的。这门炮的炮身完整无缺，有炮铭十三字，是浅刻飞白楷书：“重二百觔（斤），丙辰陆年（即公元1856年）置造，粉拾两。”（太平天国称火药为“粉”，粉拾两指明此炮能装火药拾两。）
    目前已经发现的太平天国铜炮有辛酉十一年（公元1861年）铸的四门（安徽发现），癸亥十三年（公元1863年）铸的一门（南京发现）和丁已七年（公元1857年）铸的一门（苏州发现）。　（程万孚）
