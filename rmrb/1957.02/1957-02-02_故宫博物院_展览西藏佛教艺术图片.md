    Palace Museum
    Exhibition of Tibetan Buddhist Art Pictures
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The “Exhibition of Tibetan Buddhist Art Pictures,” organized by the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, opened on January 31 at the Meridian Gate Tower of the Palace Museum. A total of 384 photographs (including sculptures, paintings, architecture, and crafts) and 21 woodcut Buddha statues are on display here.
    These materials were exhibited in Lhasa in May 1955 to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet and were praised by people from all walks of life in Lhasa. In addition to all the original exhibition pictures, some new pictures have been added to the current exhibition.
