Seize the Time, Prepare for Spring Irrigation, Guarantee Spring Planting
*People's Daily* Commentator

Since the beginning of last winter, there has been little rain or snow. Many areas have experienced varying degrees of drought. Winter irrigation in the northern regions has been poor, with the irrigated area far less than the year before, and soil moisture is generally insufficient. Therefore, making all preparations for spring farmland irrigation has become an important task in current rural work.

In order to enable spring irrigation work to be carried out extensively with preparation and planning, all localities should, based on specific conditions, incorporate spring irrigation work into the rural production work plan, organize agricultural cooperatives to make proper arrangements according to the needs of agriculture and sideline industries, and prepare for this work.

In the northern regions, a large area of irrigation facilities consists of wells. Last year alone, 4.5 million wells were added, bringing the total to more than 8 million wells, including existing ones. These existing wells play an important role in eliminating or mitigating the threat of spring drought in the northern regions and should be fully utilized. Some of these wells do not yet have sufficient water volume and need to be renovated first during the spring repairs of farmland water conservancy to increase the water output so that they can be put into spring farmland irrigation in a timely manner. A small number of wells that were silted up last year should also be restored as soon as possible. Water lifting tools should also be quickly repaired and configured. Waterwheels accumulated in various provinces should be actively promoted and sold. For newly developed well irrigation areas, the masses should also be taught techniques such as leveling the ground, ditching and furrowing, and irrigating.

The management organizations of large and medium-sized irrigation projects should list spring farmland irrigation as the central task at present. Pay attention to analyzing the changes in water source supply due to drought and formulate practical plans. All irrigation areas should adhere to day and night irrigation, improve technology, and save water. Before spring irrigation, channels and buildings should be repaired, and the organization of irrigation should be done well.

In the southern regions, farmland irrigation mainly relies on ponds, small reservoirs, and other water storage projects. Due to the drought in many areas last winter, water storage is very low, and in some places, most of the ponds have even become dry. In some areas, due to poor management and maintenance, the water in the ponds was lost in vain. Some also drained the water to dig pond mud for fertilizer. A comprehensive inspection should be carried out on these dry and leaking ponds, repairs should be made to plug leaks, and sound maintenance systems should be established to ensure timely water storage and conservation to guarantee water for rice fields.

Spring farmland irrigation is an important measure to ensure this year's agricultural production and must be given sufficient attention. If we are negligent or think that some rain and snow have fallen recently (rainfall in most parts of China last winter was less than the average rainfall for the same period in previous years) and neglect spring irrigation and relax preparations, we may make serious mistakes. As the saying goes, "A spring drought means a year lost." We must be especially vigilant.

    抓紧时机，准备春灌，保证春播	本报评论员
    去年入冬以来，雨雪稀少。不少地区发生不同程度的干旱现象。北方地区冬灌较差，已灌面积远较前年为少，一般土壤底墒不足。因此，做好春季农田灌溉的一切准备，就成为当前农村工作中一项重要任务。
    为了使春灌工作能够有准备有计划地广泛开展起来，各地应该根据具体情况，把春灌工作具体安排在农村生产工作计划以内，组织农业社按着农副业的需要妥善安排，为这项工作做好准备。
    在北方地区，大面积的灌溉设施是水井，去年一年中即增加水井四百五十万眼，连同原有水井，共达八百多万眼。这些已成的水井对于消除或减轻北方地区春旱的威胁，有着重要作用，应该充分地利用起来。这些水井中有一部分水量还不充足，需要在农田水利的春修当中首先加以改造，增大出水量，使能及时投入春季农田的灌溉。少数地区去年被淤毁了一部分水井，也应当抓紧恢复。提水工具也要赶快检修配置。各省积存的水车，应该积极设法推销。对于新发展的水井灌区，还应该教会群众平地打畦，开沟灌水等技术。
    大中型灌溉工程的管理机构，应该把春季农田灌溉列为当前的中心工作。注意分析由于天旱而发生的水源供水情况的变化，制定切实可行的计划。所有灌区都应该坚持昼夜灌溉，改进技术，节约水量。在春灌前应该对渠道及建筑物加以整修，并做好灌水的组织工作。
    在南方地区主要是依靠塘坝，小水库等蓄水工程灌溉农田。由于去年冬季不少地区遭受干旱，蓄水很少，有些地方的水塘，甚至大部分已成为干塘。有些地区因管理养护不善，把塘里的水白白漏掉。有的因挖塘泥积肥也把水放掉。对这些干塘漏塘，应该进行一次全面检查，整修补漏，健全养护制度，及时做好蓄水保水工作，以保证稻田用水。
    春季农田灌溉是保证今年农业生产的重要措施，必须引起足够的重视。如果麻痹大意，或者认为最近降了些雨雪（我国大部分地区去年冬季的降水量较历年同时期平均降水量为少），就忽视春灌，放松准备，那就可能犯严重的错误。俗话说：“春旱一年丢”。我们必须特别警惕。
