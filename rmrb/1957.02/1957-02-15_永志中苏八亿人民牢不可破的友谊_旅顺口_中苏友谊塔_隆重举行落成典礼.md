Xinhua News Agency, Luda, February 14th: The "China-Soviet Friendship Tower," which the State Council decided to build in Lushunkou, was grandly inaugurated today.

Today, the magnificent "China-Soviet Friendship Tower" was draped in bright red silk, and the area in front of the tower was filled with flowers. Evergreen pines and cypresses were planted around the tower. Hundreds of colorful flags fluttered in the wind.

The dedication ceremony was held in the square in front of the tower. Among those attending the ceremony were Li Dequan, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; General Li Da, Deputy Minister of National Defense; Zhang Xuexuan, Deputy Governor of Liaoning Province; and leading officials from the Luda City Party Committee and government.

Also attending the ceremony were Abramov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China; Major General Zudov, Military Attaché; Belyanov, Soviet Consul General in Dalian; and Soviet, Polish, and East German experts who are currently assisting in the construction of Luda.

More than four thousand people from Lushunkou who had close relations with the Soviet army, as well as officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who had jointly guarded Lushunkou with the Soviet army, also attended the ceremony.

At a little after ten o'clock, the ceremony began. After the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union were played, Li Dequan, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered a speech. She said: The Chinese people built the China-Soviet Friendship Tower here precisely to thank the Soviet army for its great contribution to defending the Far East and world peace during its stationing in Lushunkou; to commemorate the deep friendship between the troops stationed in the Lushunkou area and the residents of our country; and to forever commemorate the unbreakable, brotherly friendship between the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union.

Li Dequan said: Currently, the imperialists have not abandoned their conspiracy to launch wars of aggression and are still trying every possible means to provoke and undermine the friendship between the people of socialist countries, especially between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Let us, in front of this sublime and magnificent China-Soviet Friendship Tower, solemnly declare to those imperialist elements: their conspiracies will never succeed. We will protect the China-Soviet friendship and the unity of the people of the two countries as we protect our own eyes, and protect the unity of all countries in the socialist camp. We will firmly and continuously consolidate China-Soviet friendship and continue to strengthen the unity of all countries in the socialist camp!

Abramov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, then spoke, saying: The friendship, mutual assistance, and alliance between our two countries are not only in the interests of the Chinese and Soviet people, but also in the fundamental interests of the people of all countries in the world. The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has been vividly demonstrated again in recent days. The visit of the delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Premier Zhou Enlai to the Soviet Union not long ago demonstrated the unbreakable unity of the people of our two great countries. We Soviets are proud to have formed a friendship and alliance with the great Chinese people. We want to say: this friendship is eternal, unbreakable, and inseparable. Today, the completion of the China-Soviet Friendship Tower in Lushunkou is a concrete proof of this friendship. Finally, he expressed gratitude to the Chinese people for building this Friendship Tower.

Next, Qiao Chuanjue, Deputy Mayor of Luda and President of the Luda Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, cut the ribbon for the "China-Soviet Friendship Tower" to the music of "Moscow-Beijing." As the colored silk slowly separated from the scissors, groups of young girls presented bouquets of flowers in front of the tower. The people who attended the meeting climbed to the base of the "China-Soviet Friendship Tower," and Lin Junpu, the old engineer responsible for the construction of the tower, introduced to everyone the various reliefs on the tower that symbolize China-Soviet friendship. In the distance from this Friendship Tower, people can see the "Victory Memorial Tower" and the "Lushun Military Museum," which were completed on September 3, 1955, to commemorate China-Soviet friendship. In this Lushunkou area full of China-Soviet friendship, there are also three famous Soviet Martyrs' Towers and a "China-Soviet Friendship Hall" and other commemorative buildings.

Xinhua News Agency, Luda, February 14th: A "China-Soviet Friendship Tower" 22 meters high has been erected majestically in the square in front of the Lushun Museum.

Pedestrians walking on Lenin Street can see from afar the pure white top of the tower connecting with the blue sky. The gold and red inlays on the "China-Soviet Friendship Emblem" installed on the spire of the tower glitter in the sun. The body of the tower is made of pure white alabaster. Surrounding the tower are ancient, verdant pine trees.

The architecture of the China-Soviet Friendship Tower has a unique style. The entire tower uses more than two hundred and forty kinds of reliefs to express the great significance of China-Soviet friendship. The upper part of the dodecagonal tower is carved with flowers, symbolizing that China-Soviet friendship is like blooming flowers. The lower end of the tower body has twenty statues of Chinese and Soviet people closely surrounding each other, representing the close unity of the Chinese and Soviet people. On the second layer of the tower base are embedded four reliefs representing China-Soviet friendship. The front is Tiananmen Square in Beijing and the Kremlin in Moscow; the left side is the scene of field work at the state-owned Friendship Farm; the right side is the production situation of the Anshan Iron and Steel Group's blast furnace; and the back is the Liberation Bridge in the Lushun area and the Victory Memorial Tower completed in Lushun on September 3, 1955. Both sides of the reliefs are carved with flags symbolizing victory on pink granite. In order to enable the China-Soviet Friendship Tower to fully express the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, the designers carefully created seven different tower construction plans, and central and local officials provided opinions on the design. During the construction process, the farmers of Yexian County, Shandong Province, where alabaster is produced, enthusiastically mined stone for the memorial tower and delivered the stone needed for the tower construction to the construction site in advance. The teachers and students of the Northeast Academy of Fine Arts, who were responsible for the artistic engineering of the tower, painstakingly collected relevant materials on China-Soviet friendship and experienced the emotions of China-Soviet friendship before creating, so as to make the artistic images of the characters vivid and lively. Many famous fine stoneworkers from all over the country and many employees of the Beijing Hardware Production Cooperative came to this construction site to help with the construction.

    永志中苏八亿人民牢不可破的友谊
    旅顺口“中苏友谊塔”隆重举行落成典礼
    据新华社旅大14日电　国务院决定在旅顺口兴建的“中苏友谊塔”，今天隆重举行落成典礼。
    今天，壮丽的“中苏友谊塔”上披着鲜艳的红绸，塔前摆满了鲜花。塔四周的广场上栽植着长青的松柏。成百面彩旗迎风招展。
    落成典礼在塔前的广场上举行。参加典礼的有中苏友好协会总会副会长李德全，国防部副部长李达上将和辽宁省副省长张雪轩以及旅大市党和政府的负责人。
    苏联驻华大使馆参赞阿布拉希莫夫、武官朱道夫少将和苏联驻大连总领事别良诺夫以及正在帮助旅大建设的苏联、波兰、民主德国的专家们也参加了典礼。
    四千多名曾经和苏军亲密相处的旅顺口人民以及和苏军共同守卫过旅顺口的中国人民解放军官兵，也参加了典礼。
    十点多钟，典礼开始。在奏中苏两国国歌以后，中苏友好协会总会副会长李德全讲了话。她说：中国人民在这里建立中苏友谊塔，正是为了感谢苏军驻旅顺口期间对保卫远东与世界和平的伟大贡献；为了纪念苏军驻旅顺口地区部队和我国居民之间的深厚情谊；为了永志中苏两国八亿人民之间兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊。
    李德全说：目前，帝国主义并没有放弃发动侵略战争的阴谋，还妄想千方百计地挑拨和破坏社会主义国家的人民，特别是中苏两国人民之间的友谊。让我们在这崇高壮丽的中苏友谊塔前，正告那些帝国主义分子们：他们的阴谋是永远不会得逞的。我们会像保护自己的眼珠一样保护中苏友谊和两国人民的团结，保护社会主义阵营各国的团结。我们将坚强地、不断地巩固中苏友谊，继续增强社会主义阵营各国的团结！
    苏联驻华大使馆参赞阿布拉希莫夫接着讲话，他说：我们两国之间的友谊、互助和同盟不仅符合中苏人民的利益，而且也符合全世界各国人民的根本利益。中苏人民兄弟般的友谊，在最近这些日子里有了新的鲜明的表现。以周恩来总理为首的中华人民共和国代表团不久前到苏联进行的访问，表明了我们两个伟大国家人民的牢不可破的团结。我们苏联人由于和伟大的中国人民结成了友谊和同盟而感到自豪。我们要说：这一友谊是永恒的，牢不可破的，不可分开的。今天，中苏友谊塔在旅顺口落成，更是这一友谊的具体证明。最后对中国人民建立这一友谊塔表示感谢。
    接着，旅大市副市长、旅大市中苏友好协会会长乔传珏在“莫斯科—北京”的乐声中为“中苏友谊塔”剪彩，当彩绸从剪刀下徐徐分开的时候，一群群少女向塔前献上一束束的鲜花，参加大会的人们登上“中苏友谊塔”的塔座，负责建塔工程的老工程师林钧朴为大家介绍了塔上的象征中苏友谊的各种浮雕。在这座友谊塔的远处，人们可以看到1955年9月3日为纪念中苏友谊而落成的“胜利纪念塔”和“旅顺军事博物馆”。在这个充满中苏友谊的旅顺口地区，还有三个著名的苏军烈士塔和一座“中苏友谊馆”等纪念性建筑物。
    新华社旅大14日电　一座二十二公尺高的“中苏友谊塔”，已经巍峨地矗立在旅顺博物馆前的广场上。
    行人们走上列宁街，老远就能望见洁白的塔顶和蓝色的天空连在一起，安在塔尖上的“中苏友好徽”上的金色和红色的镶嵌物，在阳光下闪闪发光。塔身用洁白的雪花石砌成。绕在塔的周围的是古老的苍松。
    中苏友谊塔的建筑具有独特的风格。整个塔上用二百四十多种浮雕来表达中苏友好的伟大意义。在十二角形的塔身上部雕刻着花朵，象征中苏友谊就像盛开的鲜花一样；塔身的下端是二十个紧紧围绕在一起的中苏人民的雕像，表示了中苏人民亲密无间的团结。在第二层塔座上镶嵌着四幅表示中苏友谊的浮雕，正面是北京天安门和莫斯科的克里姆林宫；左面是国营友谊农场的田间工作情景；右面是鞍钢高炉的生产情况；背面是旅顺地区的解放桥和1955年9月3日在旅顺落成的胜利纪念塔。浮雕两旁粉红色的花岗石上都雕着象征胜利的旗帜。设计师们为了使中苏友谊塔能够充分表现中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，他们精心制作了七种不同的建塔方案，中央和地方负责人都曾为设计提供意见。在施工过程中，雪花石产地山东掖县的农民热心地为纪念塔开采石料，并且提前把建塔所需的石料送到了工地。负责建塔艺术工程的东北美术专科学校的师生在创作前曾不辞艰辛地搜集有关中苏友谊的资料，体验中苏友谊的情感，使人物的艺术形象生动活泼。全国各地的许多著名细石工人和北京五金生产合作社的很多职工都来到了这个工地帮助施工。
