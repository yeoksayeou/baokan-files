US, British and French Military Bases in the Middle East and North Africa

In order to compete for colonial interests in the Middle East and North Africa, the US, British, and French imperialists have intensified their control over these regions, and they are vying to establish military bases in the Middle East and North Africa. These military bases seriously undermine the sovereignty of various countries and threaten the peace and security of these regions.
	Turkey
Since Turkey accepted the so-called "aid" of the "Truman Doctrine" in 1947 and joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952, it has gradually become a US military base. The United States has nearly twenty air force bases in various parts of Turkey. Among them, the Adana Air Force Base is one of the largest bomber bases in the Middle East, with a runway as long as 14,000 feet, capable of accommodating the largest bombers. More than a dozen seaports such as Iskenderun, Istanbul, Izmir, Samsun, and Grijuk have become US naval bases.
	Iran
According to the military assistance agreement signed between the United States and Iran on May 23, 1950, the United States obtained fourteen air force bases, two seaports, and the lease of Iranian railways for 30 years in Iran.
	Saudi Arabia
On June 18, 1951, Saudi Arabia was forced to sign the "Dhahran Airport Agreement" with the United States, stipulating that the United States had the right to freely use the Dhahran Air Force Base for five years. Dhahran Airport has become one of the most important US air force bases in the Middle East. The airport has a cement runway one to two meters thick, capable of landing the largest US B-36 bombers. The United States' use of Dhahran Airport expired in 1956, but the United States refused to return it to Saudi Arabia. According to news, when the Saudi King visited the United States this time, the United States and Saudi Arabia reached an agreement that the United States would continue to use the Dhahran base for another five years. Dammam in the Persian Gulf also has an American military port; there are also many American military camps along the oil pipeline built by the United States in Saudi Arabia.
	Israel
The US Lida Airport in Israel is the largest and best-equipped airport in the Middle East. The United States has built airports capable of accommodating jet aircraft or heavy bombers in Haifa, Jerusalem, Galilee, Negev, and Nazareth. Since June 1951, the US Navy has obtained the right to use Israeli ports. Haifa Port has become a modern US military port. According to a recent report in the Egyptian "People's Daily", Britain and France are also preparing to build military bases in Israel that can station 30,000 troops.
	Iraq
British and American imperialists have built dozens of airfields in Iraq and expanded the port of Basra. According to the treaty concluded between Britain and Iraq on April 4, 1955, although Britain formally handed over the Habbaniyah and Seba bases to Iraq, it still maintains the equipment on the bases. There are reports that, according to a secret protocol to the Anglo-Iraqi treaty, Britain can redeploy troops to reoccupy the Habbaniyah and Seba bases in wartime. There are also reports that last November, the British invaders used bases in Iraq to bomb Egyptian cities.
	Cyprus
Since Cyprus was occupied by Britain, it has been used by Britain as an important military base for aggression against the Near East. In June 1954, Britain announced that Cyprus would be the location of its Joint Headquarters of Land and Air Forces in the Middle East. Britain built a huge air force base in Episkopi near Limassol, a seaport in southern Cyprus. New bases have also been built elsewhere, including the Akrotiri Airport, which can be used by atomic bombers.
During the British and French war of aggression against Egypt, Cyprus was the outpost of the aggressors.
After World War II, the United States also established its air force base in Cyprus.
	Jordan
According to the 1948 Anglo-Jordanian Twenty-Year Alliance Treaty, Britain obtained the two air force bases of Amman and Mafraq in Jordan, and stationed and trained troops on Jordanian territory. Recently, the Jordanian government is negotiating with the British government, requesting the termination of the 1948 Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, the withdrawal of British troops, and the abolition of British military bases in Jordan.
	Bahrain Islands and Kuwait
The Bahrain Islands are one of the largest US military bases in the Middle East. US fighter jets or bombers are often stationed at the airport on the Bahrain Islands.
Britain has built a submarine base in the port of Manama in the Bahrain Islands, and built airfields on islands such as Muharraq.
In 1953, Britain forced the Emir of Kuwait to allow the establishment of two British military bases in Kuwait. In the first half of 1954, the United States also began to build submarine bases and army barracks in Kuwait.
	Aden, Oman, Trucial Oman
Aden is a British naval base and also an air force base. According to a report in the US "Newsweek" on April 4, 1955, Britain attempted to turn the Aden region into an atomic and hydrogen bomb base.
Mattrah in Oman has a British airfield.
Masirah Island in Trucial Oman was a British and American air force base during World War II, and now British air force units are stationed there.
	Morocco
Before Morocco gained independence in 1956, it was a French colony. After World War II, in order to obtain US aid and suppress the increasingly high tide of national liberation movements, France allowed the United States to use many military ports and bases in Morocco. As early as 1942, the United States established naval and air bases in Rio de Oro, Morocco. Since 1951, the United States has established seven air force bases in Morocco that can be used by atomic bombers, each base covering an area of approximately 5,000 to 17,000 acres (one acre is approximately equal to six Chinese mu). In 1955, forty US air force bases were under construction. The French and Spanish governments also handed over the naval and air bases of Casablanca, Agadir, Ceuta, and Melilla to the United States in order for the United States to establish a "joint operations base" from Casablanca to Aran (Algeria). The United States has 35,000 troops stationed in Morocco.
Morocco is also the location of the headquarters of the Fifth Air Force under the jurisdiction of the US "Strategic Air Command".
	Algeria
Algeria is a French colony. Today, more than 500,000 French troops are stationed throughout Algeria, suppressing the Algerian national liberation movement. After World War II, France also allowed the United States to station troops and build military bases in Algeria. The United States has built forty airports in Algeria, mostly in the Sahara region. The United States has concentrated a large number of rocket artillery in Colomb-Béchar, and Ménouarar, 50 kilometers away from the area, has been built into a rocket artillery launching base. The French government provides the ports of Oran, Algiers, etc. for the use of the US military, and the port of Mers El Kébir near Oran has become a base for the US Sixth Fleet.
	Tunisia
Tunisia was also a French colony before independence. In 1950, France and the United States signed a military agreement, and the United States obtained the right to establish military bases in Tunisia. In recent years, the United States has built fourteen huge airports in Tunisia, built the Bizerte military port located in the heart of the Mediterranean, and occupied bases such as Karouba and Sidi Ahmed. The United States has also dug huge tunnels in the Ishkeul Mountains to store military supplies.
	Libya
When Libya declared independence on December 24, 1951, the United States, Britain, and France had already established naval and air bases in Libya. Britain has built naval and air bases in Benina, El Adem, Benghazi, Tripoli, Tobruk, and Qasr Bani Walid, and stationed a British division. The United States established a base in Tripoli and built Libya's largest bomber base – Wheelus Air Base – in Mellaha. On September 9, 1954, the United States forced Libya to conclude an agreement stipulating that the United States could use Wheelus Air Base for twenty years and could build additional air force bases and expand military facilities.
In December 1956, France handed over its military bases in Fezzan Province, Libya, to Libya. Before withdrawing from the Libyan bases, the French army destroyed all the facilities on the bases.

    美英法在中东、北非的军事基地
    美、英、法帝国主义为了争夺中东、北非地区的殖民利益，加紧控制这些地区，它们在中东和北非竞相建立军事基地。这些军事基地，严重地损害了各国的主权，威胁着这些地区的和平安全。
            土耳其
    土耳其自1947年接受了“杜鲁门主义”的所谓“援助”，并于1952年参加了北大西洋公约集团以后，就逐渐沦为美国的军事基地。在土耳其各地，美国有近二十处空军基地。其中，亚达那空军基地是中东最大的轰炸机基地之一，机场的跑道长达一万四千英尺，能供最大的轰炸机使用。伊斯肯德伦、伊斯坦布尔、伊斯密尔、萨姆松、格里朱克等十多个海港，都成了美国的海军基地。
              伊朗
    根据1950年5月23日美国和伊朗签订的军事援助协定，美国在伊朗获得了十四个空军基地、两个海港和伊朗铁路三十年的租借权。
            沙特阿拉伯
    1951年6月18日，沙特阿拉伯被迫同美国签订了“扎赫兰机场协定”，规定美国有权在五年内自由使用扎赫兰空军基地。扎赫兰机场已成为美国在中东最重要的空军基地之一。这个机场有一条一到二公尺厚的水泥跑道，能降落美国最大型的B—36型轰炸机。美国对扎赫兰机场的使用，已在1956年期满，可是美国不肯交还沙特阿拉伯。有消息说，这次沙特国王访问美国时，美国同沙特阿拉伯已达成协议，美国继续使用扎赫兰基地五年。在波斯湾的达曼，也筑有美国军港；美国在沙特阿拉伯境内建筑的输油管沿线还有许多美国的军营。
            以色列
    美国在以色列的利达飞机场，是它在中东地区最大的、设备最好的机场。在海法、耶路撒冷、加利里、纳格夫和那泽亚等地区，美国建筑了可供喷气式飞机或重轰炸机降落的飞机场。从1951年6月起，美国海军就取得了以色列港口的使用权。海法港已成为现代化的美国军港。据最近埃及“人民报”报道，英法也正在以色列筹建可以驻扎三万军队的军事基地。
          伊拉克
    英美帝国主义在伊拉克修建了几十个飞机场，扩大了巴士拉海港。根据英国和伊拉克在1955年4月4日缔结的条约，英国虽然在形式上把哈班尼雅和塞巴两个基地移交给了伊拉克，但仍保持着基地上的设备。有消息说，根据英伊条约的一个秘密议定书，英国得于战时派军队重新占领哈班尼雅和塞巴这两个基地。还有消息说，去年11月英国侵略者就曾利用在伊拉克的基地轰炸埃及城市。
            塞浦路斯
    塞浦路斯自从被英国占领以来，就一直被英国当作侵略中近东的重要军事基地。1954年6月，英国宣布以塞浦路斯作为它的中东陆空军联合总司令部的驻在地。英国在塞浦路斯南部海港利马索尔附近的埃毕科比建筑了一个巨大的空军基地。其他地方也建筑了新的基地，其中有可供原子弹轰炸机使用的阿克罗蒂里机场。
    在英法侵略埃及的战争中，塞浦路斯是侵略者的前哨基地。
    第二次世界大战后，美国在塞浦路斯也建立了它的空军基地。
              约旦
    根据1948年的英约二十年同盟条约，英国取得了约旦的安曼和麦法拉克两个空军基地，并在约旦领土上驻扎和训练军队。最近约旦政府正和英国政府进行谈判，要求结束1948年的英约条约，撤退英国驻军，取消英国在约旦的军事基地。
        巴林群岛和科威特
    巴林群岛是美国在中东最大的军事基地之一。巴林群岛的机场上经常驻有美国战斗机或轰炸机。
    英国在巴林群岛的曼纳马港建有潜水艇基地，并在穆哈克等岛上建筑了飞机场。
    1953年英国迫使科威特酋长准许在科威特建立了两个英国军事基地。1954年上半年，美国也在科威特开始修建潜水艇基地和陆军兵营。
    亚丁、阿曼、特鲁西尔阿曼
    亚丁是英国的一个海军基地，也是空军基地。据1955年4月4日美国“新闻周刊”透露，英国企图把亚丁地区变为原子弹和氢弹基地。
    阿曼的马特拉有英国飞机场。
    特鲁西尔阿曼的马西拉岛在第二次世界大战中是英美的空军基地，现在驻扎着英国空军部队。
            摩洛哥
    摩洛哥在1956年获得独立以前，是法国的殖民地。第二次世界大战以后，法国为了取得美援，镇压日益高涨的民族解放运动，把摩洛哥的许多军港与基地让给了美国使用。早在1942年，美国就在摩洛哥里奥地港建立了海空军基地。自1951年起，美国在摩洛哥建立了七个可供原子弹轰炸机使用的空军基地，每处基地占地约五千英亩到一万七千英亩（一英亩大约相当于六中国亩）。1955年，有四十个美国空军基地在建筑中。法国和西班牙政府并把卡萨布兰卡、亚加狄尔、休达、美利拉的海空军基地交给了美国，以便使美国建立一个自卡萨布兰卡一直到阿兰（阿尔及利亚）的“联合作战基地”。美国在摩洛哥有驻军三万五千名。
    摩洛哥又是美国“战略空军司令部”所辖第五航空队的司令部所在地。
          阿尔及利亚
    阿尔及利亚是法国的殖民地，今天有五十万以上的法国部队驻在阿尔及利亚各地，镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动。第二次世界大战以后，法国同样允许美国在阿尔及利亚驻扎军队和建筑军事基地。美国在阿尔及利亚建筑了四十个飞机场，大多数在撒哈拉区。美国在科隆培沙集中了大批火箭炮，距该地五十公里的美努阿拉尔已筑成火箭炮的放射基地。法国政府把阿兰、阿尔及尔等港口供给美军使用，阿兰附近的曼埃凯比港已成为美国第六舰队的基地。
            突尼斯
    突尼斯在独立前也是法国的殖民地。1950年法、美订立军事协定，美国取得在突尼斯建立军事基地的权利。近年来，美国在突尼斯已建筑了十四个巨大的飞机场，修建了位于地中海心脏的比塞大军港，并占用了卡鲁巴、西第·阿墨特等基地。美国还在依雪干尔山中挖掘了庞大的隧道以储藏军火。
            利比亚
    1951年12月24日利比亚宣布独立的时候，美、英、法三国已在利比亚境内建立了海空军基地。英国在班尼纳、厄尔·阿丹姆、班加西、的黎波里、多布鲁克、开斯特鲁·班尼突等地建有海空军基地，并驻有英军一个师。美国在的黎波里建立了基地，在梅拉哈建筑了利比亚最庞大的轰炸机基地——惠勒斯机场。1954年9月9日，美国强迫利比亚缔结一项协定，规定美国可以使用惠勒斯空军基地二十年，并可以另筑空军基地和扩充军事设备。
    法国在1956年12月把它在利比亚费赞省的军事基地交还给了利比亚。法军在撤离利比亚基地前破坏了基地上的一切设施。
