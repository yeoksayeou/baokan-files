    Collect Scrap Copper, Save Copper
    Xiaoyan
    Copper is one of the important raw materials in the electrical manufacturing industry. Manufacturing a 3,000-kilowatt generator requires two and a half tons of copper. Manufacturing 1 kilometer of 1.76 mm thick rubber-insulated wire requires 22.2 kilograms of copper. We need copper to manufacture some of the wires required to build a nationwide telegraph and telephone network. Some other industrial products also require the use of copper.
    Due to the backwardness of our copper mining equipment in the past, the production of mined copper has fallen far short of demand. Until now, most of the copper used in our industrial production has been supplied by the purchase of scrap copper. Judging from the speed of our economic construction and the development of our copper mines, this situation cannot be completely reversed in the short term. Therefore, in order to ensure the supply of copper for industrial use, in addition to actively creating conditions to accelerate copper mine construction, we must vigorously do a good job in the acquisition of scattered scrap copper, and pay attention to strictly saving the use of copper.
    However, since June of last year, the amount of scrap copper purchased has been declining month by month, with an average monthly decrease of nearly 1,000 tons. The amount purchased in December of last year had fallen to less than half of that in June.
    Does this serious situation mean that our source of scrap copper has been exhausted? No, such a conclusion cannot be drawn yet. The recent example of farmers in Guguan Township, Long County, Shaanxi Province, selling copper is a clear illustration. Wang Yucheng, a farmer in Guguan Township, used to be a middle peasant. When his father was alive, he buried a batch of copper coins under the floor of his house. Before liberation, the local reactionary government had coerced Wang Yucheng to dig up the copper coins and sell them, but he refused on the pretext. After liberation, he had planned to dig them up and sell them several times, but he didn't because he was afraid of "revealing his wealth." Recently, after hearing the staff of the township supply and marketing cooperative publicize the significance of the state's purchase of scrap copper for industrial construction and the benefits to himself, he decided to dig up the copper coins that had been buried for many years and sell them to the state. In this way, his family alone sold 4,230 kilograms of copper coins. Immediately afterwards, Chen Ruzhen, a farmer in the same village, also dug up more than 770 jin of copper coins and sold them to the state.
    The key issue at present is to strengthen the publicity and education work for the acquisition of scrap copper. The above facts show that there is still a lot of scattered scrap copper, and as long as the acquisition staff can go deep down and do a good job in publicity and education, the copper-holding households are willing to sell the copper to the state. However, some staff in some areas currently have some extremely harmful negative emotions. They believe that scrap copper has been purchased almost every year since the national liberation, and it has been almost exhausted. Especially in some areas where compulsory orders occurred in the acquisition work, after the style of compulsory orders was corrected, they did not even dare to publicize the significance of acquiring scrap copper. Some areas even dare not buy copper that is sent to their door.
    There are also too few scrap copper acquisition points. A large city like Wuhan has only had two acquisition points for a long time; Guangzhou originally had only one acquisition point, and only has four acquisition points after expansion, so that copper-holding households cannot find a place to sell copper even if they want to. In some places, you have to queue up to sell scrap copper, which seriously affects the acquisition work. At present, many supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions have not actively taken on the task of acquiring scrap copper, and supply and marketing cooperatives should properly resolve the problems that exist in this regard.
    In terms of the use of copper, many units still have serious waste. Some products could have been manufactured without copper, but they are still being manufactured with copper. At present, the use of copper materials to manufacture copper basins, copper pots, copper locks, and children's toys has not only not decreased, but is also showing an increasing trend. Many units have already switched to using ferrous metals, plastics, or pottery to replace decorative items on buildings, floor inlays, small hardware, door pulls, etc., but there are still many units that insist on not changing, and even emphasize that only copper will do. The two cities of Tianjin and Shenyang have long proved with facts that more than three-quarters of the parts and components of plumbing equipment and fire protection equipment that were originally made of copper can be replaced with substitutes, but many regions have not seriously promoted this so far. There is also waste in copper smelting. Some smelting departments have a certain amount of copper in the copper ash, but they have not fully utilized it. All of these are inconsistent with the spirit of saving copper. Therefore, in addition to hoping that the acquisition department will strengthen the acquisition of scrap copper, it is also hoped that the copper-using units will strictly save copper. All those that can be dispensed with should be dispensed with as much as possible, all those that can be used less should be used as little as possible, and all those that can be substituted should be found as much as possible so that more copper can be used in areas that are indispensable to national construction.

### 搜集废铜，节约用铜

    搜集废铜，节约用铜
    小言
    铜是电器制造工业中的重要原材料之一。制造一部三千瓩的发电机，就得要使用两吨半的铜料。制造一点七六公厘粗、一公里长的胶皮线，就得使用二十二点二公斤的铜料。我们要建设全国性的电报电话网，所需要的部分电线，也得用铜制造。还有其他若干工业制品也要使用铜料。
    由于过去我国开采铜矿的设备基础落后，矿产铜远远赶不上需要，直到目前为止，我国工业生产上所用的铜，大部分是靠收购废杂铜来供应的。从我国的经济建设速度，和我国铜矿发展的情形来看，这种局面在短期内是不能彻底扭转的。因此，为了保证工业用铜的供应，我们除应积极创造条件，加速铜矿建设以外，必须大力做好散存废杂铜的收购工作，并且要注意严格节约铜的使用。
    可是，从去年6月份以后，废杂铜收购量月月都在下降，平均每月下降数将近千吨左右，去年12月份的收购量，竟已下降到不及6月份的一半。
    这一严重情况，是不是说我们的废杂铜的来源已经枯竭了呢？不，还不能作出这样的结论。最近陕西省陇县固关乡的农民卖铜的事，就是个明显的例子。固关乡农民王玉成家里原来是个中农，他父亲在世时曾把一批铜元埋在屋内地下，解放前，当地的反动政府就曾威逼过王玉成，要他把铜元挖出来卖掉，被王托词拒绝了。解放后，他曾几次打算挖出来卖掉，但因怕“露富”，一直没挖。最近，当他听到乡供销合作社工作人员，宣传国家收购废铜对工业建设的意义和对他本身的好处以后，便决心把埋藏多年的铜元挖出来卖给国家。就这样，只他一家就卖了四千二百三十公斤铜元。紧接着同村的农民陈入珍家里也挖出了七百七十多斤铜元卖给国家。
    目前的问题，关键在于加强废杂铜收购的宣传教育工作，上述事实说明，散存废杂铜不仅还很不少，而且只要收购工作人员能够深入下去，作好宣传教育工作，存铜户是愿意把铜卖给国家的。但目前某些地区的工作人员却有一些极其有害的消极情绪，他们认为：全国解放后年年都在收购废杂铜，已经收购得差不多了。特别是在收购工作中发生过强迫命令现象的部分地区，在强迫命令的作风被纠正以后，连收购废铜的意义也不敢宣传了。有些地区甚至连送上门来的铜也不敢收购了。
    废铜收购点也嫌过少。像武汉市那样大一个城市，长期只有两个收购点；广州市原来只有一个收购点，扩增后只有四个收购点，以致存铜户想卖铜也找不到地方。有的地方卖废铜也得要排队，这就严重地影响了收购工作。目前很多地区的供销合作社还没有把收购废铜的工作积极担当起来，供销合作社应妥善解决这当中存在的问题。
    在铜的使用方面，不少单位还有严重的浪费现象。有些制品本来可以不用铜料制造的，但现在也还在继续用铜料制造。目前用铜料制造铜盆、铜锅、铜锁以及儿童玩具的事，不仅没见减少，且有增加的趋势。建筑物上的装饰品，地板镶缝、小五金、门拉杆等等，有不少单位已改用黑色金属、塑料或陶器等来代替，但也还有不少单位仍坚持不改，甚至强调非铜不用。天津和沈阳两市早已用事实作了证明：水暖器材、防火器材上原来用铜制的部分零件和部件，有四分之三以上可以采用代用品，但至今很多地区都没认真加以推广。在铜的冶炼上也有浪费现象，有些冶炼部门铜灰中含有一定数量的铜，也没有充分加以利用。这些都是与节约用铜的精神不相符的。因此，除了希望收购部门加强废铜收购工作以外，也希望用铜单位严格节约用铜。凡是可不用的应尽量不用，凡是可少用的应尽量少用，凡是可以代用的应尽量地找代用品，以便拿出更多的铜来用在国家建设中不可缺少的方面。
