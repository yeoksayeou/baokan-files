Thousands of meetings between voters and candidates have been held here.

Currently, clubs, cultural palaces, and institutions in various districts of Moscow are decorating polling stations.

The Ukrainian people will elect 336,000 representatives to local Soviets at all levels. Hundreds of thousands of propagandists are working throughout the republic. On the eve of the election, the work of many local Soviets has become more active. The executive committees of the Kiev and other city Soviets have recently discussed issues related to residents' lives, improving the trade network, and public facilities.

In the Tajik Republic, nominated candidates for local Soviet representatives are completing registration procedures, and candidates in various regions are meeting with voters. Radio broadcasting stations have been established in remote mountain villages that are difficult to reach in winter to facilitate communication on election day. There are about forty such broadcasting stations in remote mountain villages such as Pamir.

The people of the Kyrgyz Republic are actively participating in pre-election activities. Some members of the Communist Youth League in the Frunze Oblast skied to many remote pastures to conduct work among the herdsmen.
