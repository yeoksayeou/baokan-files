The famous comedian Yin Xiucen, who has been absent from the screen for a long time, is about to meet the audience again. He plays a fat passenger in the new film "An Informal Person" which is about to be released. The film shows a train speeding across the beautiful fields of Jiangnan. In the soft-seat carriage of this train, the fat passenger has not yet found a seat, but an "informal person" is lying horizontally on a double seat, sound asleep under a newspaper, and cannot be awakened. At this time, the fat passenger's large body blocked the passengers coming and going in the carriage, causing an interesting entanglement. Yin Xiucen couldn't help laughing when he introduced these comical scenes to the reporter.

The reporter recently visited Yin Xiucen at his home at the Changchun Film Studio. His current weight is more than 310 pounds, an increase of 50 or 60 pounds since 1946. Yin Xiucen told the reporter that Changchun Film Studio took great care of him. Because he has difficulty moving, he is picked up and dropped off by car. People always come forward to help him when they see him going up and down the stairs. His dormitory is also in the factory, so he doesn't have to walk back and forth to work. Speaking of these things, he recalled the hardships of the past twenty years. In the old society, the bosses of film companies often asked him to play roles that hurt his self-esteem in order to cater to the audience's low tastes.

More than two years ago, after Yin Xiucen came to the Changchun Film Studio, there was a debate in the film art circles: it was believed that comedy and satire films were only suitable for exposing the dark side of the old society, and not suitable for the needs of the new society. Therefore, during this period, Yin Xiucen did not make films or perform publicly. Since the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, Yin Xiucen has reappeared, and he has started again as the comedian he loves and is best at. He believes that his comedic performances will bring ease and pleasure to the audience. Recently, in addition to participating in the filming of "An Informal Person", he also played a Kuomintang officer in the drama "Fang Zhenzhu" performed by the Changchun Film Studio's Actors Drama Troupe, and received good reviews. The Changchun City Drama Troupe has now invited him to participate in the satirical drama "Promotion Chart". When the reporter visited him, he was already reading the script of the third act. Now, in addition to preparing to participate in the performance, he is also collaborating with others to write comedy scripts.

Yin Xiucen finally told the reporter a piece of news: the comedian Han Langen has been invited to come to the Changchun Film Studio. These two colleagues have been working together for more than 20 years, and the once famous fat and thin duo in the film industry, are about to cooperate again.

    会见喜剧演员殷秀岑
    新华社记者　王文琏
    阔别银幕已久的著名喜剧演员殷秀岑，又要和观众见面了。他在快要上演的新片“不拘小节的人”里面饰演一位胖旅客。影片中出现火车在秀丽的江南原野上奔驰的画面。在这列客车的软席车厢里，这位胖旅客还没有找到座位，但在一张双人座席上横卧着一位“不拘小节的人”，正盖着报纸呼呼地熟睡，叫他也不醒。这时胖旅客肥大的身躯，堵住了车厢里来往的乘客，引起了一场有趣的纠葛。殷秀岑向记者介绍这些滑稽镜头时，自己也禁不住哈哈大笑。
    记者最近去长春电影制片厂在殷秀岑的家里访问了他。他现在的体重是三百一十多斤，比1946年增加了五、六十斤。殷秀岑告诉记者，长影给他许多照顾。因为他行动困难，外出用小汽车接送。人们看到他上楼下楼时，总要上前攙扶。他的宿舍也在厂内，以免上班下班往返走路。谈到这些，他回溯起二十多年来的辛酸往事。在旧社会，电影公司的老板为了迎合观众的低级趣味，常要他扮演有伤自尊心的角色。
    两年多以前，殷秀岑到长春电影制片厂后，电影艺术界曾存在着这样的争论：认为喜剧、讽刺剧电影只适合于揭露旧社会的阴暗面，不适合于新社会的需要。因此，在这期间，殷秀岑没有拍摄电影和公开演出。自从“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针提出后，殷秀岑又露面了，他重新开始做他最热爱和最擅长的喜剧演员。他认为，他的喜剧性的表演，将使观众得到轻松和愉快。最近，他除了参加拍摄“不拘小节的人”以外，还在长春电影制片厂演员话剧团公演的话剧“方珍珠”里，扮演了一个国民党军官，受到好评。长春市话剧团现已邀请他参加演出讽刺话剧“陞官图”。记者去访问他时，他已经在读这个剧本第三幕的台词了。现在，他除了准备参加演出外，还和别人合作编写喜剧剧本。
    殷秀岑最后告诉记者一件新闻，喜剧演员韩兰根应邀就要到长春电影制片厂来了。这两个同事二十多年，曾在影坛上名盛一时的胖瘦老搭挡，又要合作演出了。
