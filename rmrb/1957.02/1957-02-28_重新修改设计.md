    Re-modifying Designs

    The Ministry of Chemical Industry modified the design plan for the Lanzhou Chlor-Alkali Plant, and the steel saved is enough to build a superphosphate fertilizer plant with an annual output of 400,000 tons. This fact shows that saving steel requires not only the steel-using departments to pay great attention, but also the design departments to pay special attention. In the past six months, some designers have had a tendency to pursue novelty, grandness, inappropriately increase the safety factor, and pursue first-class standards. If each construction unit can earnestly review and check the past designs and re-modify them, it is estimated that the savings achieved would be considerable.

    重新修改设计
    化学工业部修改兰州氯肥厂的设计方案，节省下来的钢材，足足够建设一座年产四十万吨过磷酸钙的磷肥厂用的全部钢材。这个事实说明，节约钢材不单是使用钢材的部门需要大力注意，而设计部门更要特别注意。近半年来某些设计人员存在着贪新贪大、不适当地加大安全系数、追求第一流的倾向，如果每个建筑单位，都能认真地审核检查一下过去的设计，重新作一次修改，估计节约的成绩是很可观的。
