The Nanhai Sugar Factory under construction

The Nanhai Sugar Factory, one of the four large-scale state-owned sugar factories under construction in Guangdong Province, has now entered the equipment installation phase and will be put into production in the fourth quarter of this year. After completion, the Nanhai Sugar Factory will be able to squeeze and steam two thousand tons of sugar cane per day. This factory was designed by our own country, and most of the machines are also made in our country. Photo by Zhao Muzhi (Manuscript from Southern Daily) (Attached picture)
    In the pressing workshop, which has fully entered the stage of machine installation, two large steam engines and six sets of pressing rollers and other equipment will be installed.
    Seamless steel pipes have been shipped from Anshan, and the boiler plant will begin construction.
    In the construction of the unloading sugar dock, four cement caissons were saved due to detailed study of the geological foundation.

    建设中的南海糖厂
    广东省正在建设中的四个大型国营糖厂之一——南海糖厂，现在已经进入设备安装阶段，今年第四季度即可投入生产。南海糖厂建成后，每天能榨蒸两千吨。这个工厂是由我国自己设计的，绝大部分机器也是我国制造的。　赵慕志摄（南方日报社稿）（附图片）
    全面进入安装机器的压榨车间里要安装二台大型蒸气机、六组压榨辘等设备。
    无缝钢管从鞍山运来了，锅炉厂房就要开始修建。
    在建筑卸糖码头中，由于详细研究了地质基础，节约了四个水泥沉箱。
