Xinhua News Agency, February 12th – The Second Member Representative Assembly of the Architectural Society of China opened in Beijing today.

More than two hundred architects and designers from all over the country will summarize and exchange experiences through this conference, and more than sixty related papers will be read at the meeting. The meeting will also focus on studying the issue of carrying out increased production and economy in architectural work, and further implementing the policy of "economy, practicality, and beauty under possible conditions" in civil buildings. The urban planning schemes of Beijing and Shenyang will also be discussed in detail.

The Architectural Society was established in September 1953. It now has more than 3,000 members. Branches have been established in twenty-three major cities, and it has joined the International Union of Architects. In the past four years, the Society has frequently organized experts to assist the government in studying important cultural building design schemes in various regions, and has sent representatives to participate in international conferences and visit foreign countries.

Xinhua News Agency, February 12th – Kong Xiangzhen, Deputy Director of the State Construction Commission, said at the opening of the Second Member Representative Assembly of the Architectural Society of China today that the basic construction tasks of the country's First Five-Year Plan can be overfulfilled this year. The investment amount stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan was 42.7 billion yuan, of which about 81% had been completed by the end of 1956, with only 19% of the task to be completed this year. There are many favorable conditions for completing such a task this year. Preparations in terms of equipment, design, and construction are now in place.

Kong Xiangzhen introduced the achievements of architectural design in our country over the past four years. He said that the contingent of surveying and design workers in our country has now grown to nearly 110,000 people. We have already begun to carry out industrial building design in conjunction with large-scale industrial construction projects, such as a factory producing 15,000 tractors per year, and medium-sized boiler factories. With the help and guidance of Soviet experts, some design institutions have been able to independently undertake the complete design of many industrial enterprises, such as steel plants producing one million tons of steel per year, natural oil refineries producing 500,000 to one million tons per year, thermal power plants, cement plants, and small and medium-sized machine tool factories. Civil building design is almost entirely independently undertaken by our country's design personnel. After opposing retrogressive ideas, formalism, and the pursuit of luxury in architecture, the cost of various buildings has been significantly reduced. The cost of buildings such as universities and administrative office buildings has dropped from more than 100 yuan per square meter to 70 yuan, and the construction cost of residential buildings has also dropped from about 90 yuan to 60 yuan. If calculated comprehensively according to this standard, the funds saved due to the reduction in construction costs of residential buildings and dormitories built nationwide from 1955 to 1956 may reach about 600 million yuan.

In 1956, the phenomenon of design work lagging behind construction needs was changed, and most of the drawings were delivered to the construction units according to plan. Attention was also paid to implementing economical technical measures in the design. According to statistics from relevant departments, the efforts of the designers have saved more than 20,000 tons of steel and more than 43,000 tons of cement. The construction and installation force also developed to about 2 million people in 1956, and is now able to undertake the construction tasks stipulated by the state.

In terms of urban planning, before 1956, in coordination with the development of industrial construction, the planning of more than 20 industrial cities had been completed, and the industrial buildings, public utilities, transportation, and residential buildings of these cities had been arranged in a relatively reasonable manner. We are now planning for cities to be newly built and rebuilt during the Second Five-Year Plan.

The training of talent for basic construction has also achieved great results.

Kong Xiangzhen believes that the above achievements are inseparable from the efforts of architects, engineers, construction workers, and construction educators, as well as the Architectural Society of China. In his report, Kong Xiangzhen called on the architectural experts and representatives present to actively respond to the call for increased production and economy put forward by the Party Central Committee. He believes that there is great potential for increased production and economy in basic construction. If we can correctly grasp the ratio of basic construction development in various departments, strengthen construction planning work, rationally arrange construction progress, and issue basic construction plans as early as possible, we can achieve maximum savings. Secondly, we must conduct serious economic and technical comparisons in the design of various construction projects and choose the most reasonable plan. In the renovation and design of urban and enterprise projects, we must make full use of existing equipment and old buildings. In construction, we must pay attention to arranging the overall project progress plan, strengthen construction preparation work, and ensure project quality.

Kong Xiangzhen also made explanations on implementing the policy of "suitability, economy, and beauty under possible conditions" in architecture, combined with the issue of increasing production and practicing economy. He pointed out that the relationship between economy, suitability, and beauty is interconnected and inseparable, and economy, suitability, and beauty should not be opposed to each other. "Beauty under possible conditions" is proposed based on the country's current economic situation and the people's living standards. At present, the implementation of this policy has achieved some results, but it has also encountered some difficulties, which need to be gradually overcome by architects, engineers, and construction workers giving full play to their high sense of political responsibility and artistic talent.

Finally, Kong Xiangzhen suggested to the representatives present: adopt the method of letting a hundred schools of thought contend to summarize the experience in architectural work; and launch a standard design competition for civil buildings.

### 在建筑设计中做到最大的节约  建筑学会在京召开会员代表大会  孔祥祯勉励大家努力增产节约

    在建筑设计中做到最大的节约
    建筑学会在京召开会员代表大会
    孔祥祯勉励大家努力增产节约
    新华社12日讯　中国建筑学会第二届会员代表大会今天在北京开幕。
    来自全国各地的二百多位建筑师和设计师将通过这次大会总结、交流经验，并要在这个会上宣读六十多篇有关的论文。会上还要着重研究在建筑工作中开展增产节约的问题和在民用建筑上进一步贯彻
  “经济、适用和可能条件下的美观”的方针问题，对北京市和沈阳市的城市规划方案也要进行详细的讨论。
    建筑学会是在1953年9月间成立的。现在已有会员三千多人。在二十三个大城市都成立了分会，并已参加了国际建筑师协会。在过去四年中，学会经常组织专家协助政府研究各地的重要文化建筑设计方案，并派出代表参加国际会议和到国外访问。
    新华社12日讯　国家建设委员会副主任孔祥祯在今天开幕的中国建筑学会第二届会员代表大会上说：国家第一个五年计划的基本建设任务在今年可以超额完成。第一个五年计划规定的投资额四百二十七亿元，到1956年底已经完成81％左右，只有19％的任务要在今年完成。今年完成这样的任务有许多有利条件。设备、设计、施工等方面的准备工作现在都已就绪。
    孔祥祯介绍了我国建筑设计四年来的成绩。他说，我国目前勘测设计工作者的队伍已发展到近十一万人。已经开始配合大型工业建设项目进行工业建筑设计，如年产一万五千台拖拉机的工厂，和中型锅炉厂。在苏联专家的帮助和指导下，有些设计机构已能独立担负起许多工业企业的成套设计，如年产百万吨钢的钢铁厂，年产五十万到一百万吨的天然炼油厂、火电站、水泥厂、中小型机床厂等。民用建筑设计几乎全部都是由我国的设计人员独立负担的。在反对建筑上的复古主义、形式主义和追求豪华的思想后，各项建筑的造价有了显著减少，高等学校、行政办公楼等建筑的造价已由每平方公尺一百元以上降到七十元，住宅的建筑造价也由九十元左右降到六十元。如果按这个标准来综合计算，1955年到1956年全国建设的住宅、宿舍由于造价降低而节约的资金可能达到六亿元左右。
    1956年在设计工作上已经改变了跟不上施工需要的现象，大部分的图纸都做到按计划交付给施工单位。在设计中还注意了贯彻节约的技术措施，据有关部门统计，由于设计者的努力已经节省钢材二万多吨，水泥四万三千多吨。建筑安装力量1956年也发展到二百万人左右，已经能够担负国家规定的建设任务。
    在城市规划工作上，1956年前配合工业建设的发展，已完成了二十多个工业城市的规划，比较合理的安排了这些城市的工业建筑、公用事业、交通运输和居住建筑。现在正在为第二个五年计划新建和改建的城市做规划。
    基本建设的人材培养工作也有很大成绩。
    孔祥祯认为以上这些成绩的取得和建筑师、工程师、建筑工作者和建筑教育工作者以及中国建筑学会的努力分不开。孔祥祯在报告中号召到会的建筑专家和代表们积极响应党中央所提出的增产节约的号召。他认为基本建设方面增产节约的潜力很大。如果能正确掌握各部门基本建设发展的比例，加强建设的规划工作，合理安排建设进度，尽可能早的下达基本建设计划，就能做到最大的节约。其次要在各项建设工程的设计中认真地进行经济技术比较，选择最合理的方案。城市和企业工程的改建设计上要充分利用旧有的设备和旧有建筑物。在施工中要注意安排工程总进度计划，加强施工准备工作，确保工程质量。
    孔祥祯还就建筑中贯彻“适用、经济和在可能条件下的美观”这一方针，结合增产节约问题作了说明。他指出，经济、适用、美观的关系是互相联系不可分离的，不能把经济、适用和美观对立起来。
  “可能条件下的美观”是根据国家目前的经济情况和人民生活水平而提出的。目前这一方针的贯彻已经取得了一些成绩，但也遇到了一些困难，这些困难有待建筑师、工程师和建筑工作者们发挥高度的政治责任心和艺术才能来逐步克服。
    最后孔祥祯向到会代表建议：采用百家争鸣的办法总结建筑工作中的经验；开展民用建筑标准设计竞赛运动。
