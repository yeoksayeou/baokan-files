    Academic Committee Meeting Held at the Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    Discussing this Year's Research Work Plan and Cadre Training Issues
    (Our report) Changchun – The Academic Committee of the Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, held its second meeting from February 12th to 16th. The meeting discussed the summary of research work in 1956, the research work plan for 1957, and studied issues such as cadre training and the draft of the second five-year scientific research plan. Sixteen academic papers were also presented at the meeting. Most of these papers were research reports presented by young scientific workers under the guidance of senior scientists.
    In last year's research work, the Institute of Applied Chemistry made considerable progress in the separation and analysis methods of rare elements; it preliminarily trial-produced the I-V type oscilloscope polarograph, opening up new avenues for domestic research and application of polarographic analysis in the future. Regarding the structure and properties of polymers, it was discovered that the transition of natural rubber from viscous flow to plastic flow is due to crystallization. Affirmative conclusions have been reached regarding the suitability of using sugarcane bagasse as a raw material for producing viscose rayon. Over the past year, researchers at the institute have written a total of sixty work reports and research reports; combined with the formulation of long-term plans, more than seventy literature reviews have been completed. Through more than 270 academic activities over the past year, the theoretical and academic level of research staff has also been improved.
    Among the sixty-eight research topics of the Institute of Applied Chemistry this year, fifty-seven belong to the projects stipulated in the National Twelve-Year Science and Technology Plan. These include research on the main catalytic reactions and reaction mechanisms in heavy organic synthesis; research on new technological processes for extracting related light metals in conjunction with China's resource characteristics; research on tung oil; exploring the laws of corrosion of machinery and tools and new anti-corrosion methods; and research on the purification of semiconductor raw materials, etc.
    Through the discussions at this meeting, the unity of research work and cadre training was clarified. Cadre training should mainly be achieved through practical exercise in research work, so that on-the-job researchers can be trained and improved. The study of basic theory and professional theory should be closely integrated with research work.

    科学院应用化学研究所举行学术委员会会议
    讨论今年研究工作计划和培养干部问题
    本报讯　长春中国科学院应用化学研究所于2月12日到16日举行学术委员会第二次会议。会议讨论了1956年研究工作总结、1957年研究工作计划；并研究了培养干部以及第二个五年科学研究规划草案等问题。会上还宣读了十六篇学术论文。这些论文大部分是青年科学工作者在年长科学家的指导下提出的研究报告。
    应用化学研究所在去年一年的研究工作中，对稀有元素的分离、分析方法作了不少研究；初步试制出I—V型示波极谱仪，为今后国内研究和应用极谱分析开辟了新的途径。在高聚物的结构和性能方面，发现天然橡胶由粘流变成塑流是由于结晶的缘故。对利用甘蔗渣为原料制粘液人造丝的适用性，已获得肯定的结论。一年来全所研究人员共编写了六十篇工作报告和研究报告；结合制定长远规划，完成了七十多篇文献总结。一年来通过二百七十多次学术活动，研究工作人员的理论学术水平也得到了提高。
    应用化学研究所今年的六十八个研究题目中，有五十七个是属于国家十二年科学技术规划所规订的项目。其中包括重有机合成中主要催化反应及反应机构的研究；结合我国资源特点，研究提炼有关轻金属的新工艺过程；桐油的研究；探求机器、工具的腐蚀规律和新的防腐方法；有关半导体原料提纯的研究等等。
    经过这次会议讨论，明确了研究工作和培养干部的统一性。培养干部，应该主要通过研究工作的实际锻炼，使在职研究人员得到培养和提高。基础理论和专业理论的学习，应该和研究工作密切结合。
