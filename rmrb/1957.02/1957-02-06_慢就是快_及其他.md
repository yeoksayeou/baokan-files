Reading Mei Lanfang's "Forty Years of Stage Life" is interesting and beneficial. Reading Gai Jiaotian's "The Ups and Downs of an Actor's Life" is similarly interesting and beneficial. These two famous actors, through their personal experiences, vividly and concretely tell us that to achieve success in any undertaking, one must be humble, diligent, absorb tradition, experience life, respect teachers and friends, care for the masses, study diligently, and innovate.

Mei Lanfang achieved success through his own efforts in relatively good environmental conditions. Gai Jiaotian's circumstances were very difficult, so his achievement was particularly hard-earned, and his subjective efforts are especially moving because of their perseverance. "Practicing Kung Fu on an empty stomach," "having no clothes to wear in winter," developing excellent skills amidst hunger and cold; this is greatly encouraging to young people (not limited to actors) who are now being nurtured by the people under conditions even better than those of Mei Lanfang.

There is a passage in "The Ups and Downs of an Actor's Life" that I find particularly interesting:

"For Wusheng (martial male roles), the beginner usually starts with plays like 'Exploring the Village,' 'Centipede Ridge,' 'Tiger Fighting,' and 'Night Flight.' The first play is a crucial key. For example, let's say you start with 'Exploring the Village,' you have to spend eight months on it. Every move, every sentence, every word must be done carefully and without ambiguity. This first play is a foundation, it doesn't matter if you are a little clumsy, just don't go astray, do everything according to the rules, and be sure not to be frivolous, otherwise you will not go on the right path, and it will be troublesome to change later. If the foundation of the first play is not well laid, then the subsequent plays will not be learned well. 'Slow is fast.' With the foundation of the first play, the second play, 'Centipede Ridge,' will only take four months, and the third play, 'Tiger Fighting,' will only take two months. With the foundation of these plays, after that, you can learn the subsequent plays by hearing about them and then figuring out how to perform them yourself." ("Drama News," No. 11, 1956)

"Slow is fast," this is a strange saying, but it makes a lot of sense. Basic knowledge in science and basic movements in technology, since they are called "basic" and "fundamental," are the foundations on which everything else is based. Accurate basic knowledge and solid basic movements are of utmost importance to the progress of subsequent learning; and laying the foundation is the beginning, and "everything is hard at the beginning"; since it is important and difficult, one must put in deep effort and be slow.

Some people now feel that they have too little time to read the newspaper every day, and they cannot read it quickly, so it is difficult to grasp the contents of the newspaper. In fact, this is precisely because they have not put in the necessary slow effort. For example, for certain major international events, if you do not carefully clarify the basic points the first time they are reported, you will become more and more confused as more news comes out. If you clarify and remember the key points at the beginning, then the next day when you read the newspaper, because you already have a solid understanding of the old situation, you only need to pay attention to studying and remembering the key points of the new situation; in this way, you can accumulate and organize new knowledge on the existing foundation every day, the lines are clear, the memory is easy, and reading new news and papers on this issue will become faster and faster.

When studying "Das Kapital," if you put in some slow effort and thoroughly clarify the issues of "the two factors of commodities," "the dual nature of labor," and "the form of value or exchange value" in the first chapter of the first volume, and understand both the basic concepts and the way of thinking, then you may be able to go faster later. Otherwise, you will not only not be able to go faster later, but you will often be unable to move forward at all.

The principle of "slow is fast" is not a new invention by Gai Jiaotian. Confucius said long ago: "Haste makes waste." Ruan Yuan of the Qing Dynasty also said about reading: "People often boast of the ability to read ten lines at a glance, but I laugh at them; one must read ten glances at one line to truly be able to read."

It is not only about reading and learning opera; writing calligraphy must also start slowly with writing regular script, blacksmithing must also start slowly with using a sledgehammer, and combat training also only requires accuracy at the beginning, not speed... All skilled labor is based on accurate and simple movements that are trained slowly.

Unfortunately, there are still some people who are self-righteous, impatient, and rash, pursuing the ability to read ten lines at a glance, and trying to achieve everything at once, even when dancing social dances, they do not first learn the basic steps and postures properly, but jump into "fancy" moves as soon as they enter the dance floor, resulting in all kinds of ugliness later on, which cannot be corrected.

Confucius said: "Following one's heart's desire without overstepping the bounds." This is indeed a remarkable thing, pursued by people who emphasize "creativity," "liveliness," and "freedom." But many people only pay attention to "following one's heart's desire" while ignoring "without overstepping the bounds," which inevitably leads to subjective arbitrariness. Moreover, even Confucius only achieved this at the age of "seventy"; I think that those who "set their minds on learning" at the beginning should focus on "without overstepping the bounds." As for myself, when I learned to write, I started practicing running and cursive scripts from the beginning, and I still write terribly today; when I was learning blacksmithing, I saw the master blacksmith's hammer movements were extremely beautiful, and I imitated them formally once, but I was reprimanded; these lessons were extremely profound for me. But in other matters, once I forget this lesson, I inevitably make mistakes.

Dialectical materialism teaches us that people must recognize and master objective necessity in order to be free. Engels said: "Freedom of the will, therefore, means nothing but the capacity to make decisions with knowledge of the subject. Therefore the more free a man’s judgment is in relation to a definite question, the greater is the necessity with which the content of that judgment will be determined... Freedom consists in the control over ourselves and over external nature which is founded on the knowledge of natural necessity." If I may add to this, the "bounds" that Confucius spoke of, is the equivalent of "necessity," and "following one's heart's desire" is the equivalent of "freedom;" then, it can also be said: one must first achieve "without overstepping the bounds" in order to "follow one's heart's desire."

I have rambled on too much, but the meaning I want to convey is very simple, that is: if we want to be free, we must first learn to observe discipline; if we want to be lively and dynamic, we must first learn to be serious and conscientious; if we want to think independently, we must first be good at considering the opinions of others; if we want to be creative, we must first be familiar with existing knowledge... and finally, if you want to be fast, you must first be slow.

### “慢就是快”及其他
回春

    “慢就是快”及其他	回春
    读梅兰芳的“舞台生活四十年”，有趣又有益。读盖叫天的“粉墨春秋”，同样有趣又有益。这两位名演员，以他们亲身的经历，具体生动地告诉我们：任何事业上要有成就，必须谦虚，勤奋，摄取传统，体验生活，尊重师友，关心群众，深研苦练，推陈出新。
    梅兰芳是在较好的环境条件下经过自己的努力而得到成就的。盖叫天的境遇非常困苦，所以他的成就特别不易，而他的主观努力的坚毅之处，就特别令人感动。“空着肚子练功”、“冬天没衣服穿”，在饥寒生活中练出了一身好本领；这事，对于现在的比梅兰芳更优越的条件下受着人民培养的青年们（不限于演员），是有很大的鼓舞作用的。
    “粉墨春秋”里，有一段话特别使我感到兴趣：
    “武生开蒙大都是‘探庄’‘蜈蚣岭’‘打虎’‘夜奔’这几出戏。头一出戏是个重要关键，譬如说先学‘探庄’吧，得花八个月时间，一举一动，一句话，一个字都不能含糊过去，这一出戏是个正字，那怕笨一些，别歪，处处按着规矩做，千万不能油，否则走不上正路，再回头改就费事了。头一出戏基础没打好，以后的戏也学不好。‘慢就是快’，有了头一出的基础，二一出‘蜈蚣岭’只消四个月时间，三一出的‘打虎’只消两个月。有了这几出戏的基础，以后的戏给他说一说，自己就能去揣摩着表演了。”（“戏剧报”，1956年第十一期）
    “慢就是快”，这话很怪，但很有理。科学上的基础知识，技术上的基本动作，既然叫做“基础”和“基本”，就是往后处处作为根据的东西。基础知识确切，基本动作踏实，对往后的学习的进展有极重要的意义；而打基础是开头，“万事开头难”；重要而难，就须下深功夫，要慢。
    现在有的人，感到每天读报时间少，又读不快，所以报纸的内容不易抓住。其实，这正是没有下必要的慢功夫的缘故。例如，对于某些重大国际事件，不在第一次见报的时候，把基本的要点仔细弄清楚，以后消息越多就会越来越糊涂。要是在开始的时候，弄清、记住了要点，第二天看报，因为旧情况心里已经有底，所以只要注意研究和记忆新情况的要点就好了；这样，每天在已有的基础上积累和组织新知识，线路既分明，记忆又容易，读起有关这个问题的新的消息和论文来，也就越来越快了。
    学习“资本论”，如果下点慢功夫，把第一卷第一篇里面的“商品的二因素”、“劳动的二重性”和“价值形态或交换价值”等问题彻底弄清，既懂得了基本概念，又领会了思想方法，那么，往后就可能快了。否则，往后不但快不了，反而时常会寸步难进的。
    “慢就是快”这道理，并不是盖叫天的新发明。孔子早就说过：“欲速则不达”。清朝的阮元论读书，也说过：“世人每矜一目十行之才，余哂之；夫必十目一行，始是真能读书也。”
    岂但读书和学戏；写字也要慢慢地从写正楷起始，打铁也要慢慢地从运大锤入手，战斗动作的训练，开头也只要求准确，而不求迅速……任何熟练劳动，无不以慢慢地训练出来的准确的简单动作为基础的。
    可惜，现在还有一些人，自作聪明，急躁冒进，追求一目十行，一蹴而就，连跳交际舞，也不先把基本的步法和姿势学稳妥，而一下场就跳“花样”，以致后来丑态百出，改不过来。
    孔子说过：“从心所欲不逾矩。”这确是了不起的事，很为强调“创造性”、“活泼”、“自由”的人们所追求。但许多人，只注意“从心所欲”，而无视“不逾矩”，这就不免陷入主观随意性。而且，就是孔子，也是到了“七十”，才达到这成就的；我以为，开始“志于学”的人，还是着重在“不逾矩”的好。我自己，学写字，一开始就练行、草，至今写得一塌糊涂；学打铁的时候，看到老师傅运锤的姿势极其美妙，从形式上模仿了一次，却受到了斥责；这些教训对我是极深刻的。但在别的事情上，一忘记这教训，就不免出毛病。
    辩证唯物主义教导我们：人要认识和掌握了客观必然性，才能自由。恩格斯说：“意志自由无非是指以通晓事实的知识来作出决定的能力。这样，人对一定问题的判断愈是自由，则这个判断的内容之决定就带有愈大的必然性……自由是建立在对那些支配着我们自己并支配着外间自然界的自然必然性的认识上面的。”如果可以附会，孔子所说的“矩”，相当于“必然性”，而“从心所欲”相当于“自由”；那么，也可以说：先要做到“不逾矩”，才能“从心所欲”。
    话拉扯得多了，但我想说的意思很简单，就是：我们要能自由，必先学会守纪律；要能活泼生动，必先学会严肃认真；要能独立思考，必先善于思考别人的意见；要有创造性，必先通达已有的知识……最后是，要快，必先慢。
