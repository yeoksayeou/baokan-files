Shanxi Province Draws Provincial-Level Cadres to Serve as County-Level Leaders in Rotation

(Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch, February 26th) The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee, in order to strengthen leadership over rural work, recently selected forty-two leading cadres from provincial-level organizations and assigned them to eighteen different types of counties, including Taigu, Pingyao, and Hongzhao, to serve in key county-level leadership positions.

Of the forty-two leading cadres selected, twenty-three are current secretaries and members (and alternate members) of the Provincial Party Committee, heads and deputy heads of the Provincial Party Committee departments, deputy principals of the Party School, heads and deputy heads of the Provincial People's Committee departments and bureaus, deputy directors of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, deputy directors of the Handicraft Cooperative, and the secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League. They will serve concurrently as the first secretary of the county Party committee or county head, with a term of approximately one and a half years, at which time they will be rotated with other leading cadres from provincial-level organizations. Among the leading cadres selected, there are also nineteen heads and deputy heads of provincial-level organizations, or cadres equivalent to heads and deputy heads. After arriving in the county, they will serve as secretaries of the county Party committee or county heads for a long term.

On February 26th, Comrade Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, mobilized the selected leading cadres. He encouraged everyone to share weal and woe with the cadres and masses after arriving in the county and to strive to build a new socialist countryside. At present, these cadres are actively handing over their duties in the organizations and preparing their luggage, and are expected to arrive at their new posts successively in early March.
