    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, February 1st: Ceylonese Governor-General Sir Oliver Goonetilleke received Premier Zhou Enlai and his party at Queen's House (Governor-General's Residence) immediately after their arrival in Colombo on January 31st.
    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, February 1st: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long and their party received a grand welcome when they arrived in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, on the afternoon of January 31st.
    Ten thousand Ceylonese people gathered at the festively decorated Ratmalana Airport, shouting welcoming slogans as the Chinese Premier stepped off the plane. Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike greeted him near the aircraft's hatch.
    The Chinese Premier and Vice-Premier walked along the red carpet to the podium, accepted the salute of the joint armed forces honor guard, and inspected the honor guard. They were also introduced to high-ranking Ceylonese civil and military officials, as well as members of the diplomatic corps stationed in Colombo. After Premier Zhou Enlai signed a golden book, he addressed the welcoming crowd. He thanked Prime Minister Bandaranaike and the government and people of Ceylon for inviting him to visit Ceylon, and conveyed the fraternal greetings of the Chinese people to the Ceylonese people. He recalled the economic and cultural ties between China and Ceylon since ancient times, and their mutual sympathy and support for each other's struggles for national independence. He said that after both countries gained independence, "Ceylon was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China."
    He said that the friendly relations between the two countries have developed in new ways in recent years. "We believe that after China and Ceylon formally establish diplomatic relations, our friendship and cooperation will definitely have further development."
    After the speech, a group of Buddhist monks chanted blessings, including several Japanese monks visiting Ceylon who beat peace drums.
    As Premier Zhou Enlai walked towards the welcoming crowd and left the airport in a motorcade along the eleven-mile route to the city, the crowd cheered, waved, and shouted slogans continuously. The motorcade of Chinese guests had to advance through narrow gaps in the crowded masses.

    锡兰总督接见周恩来总理
    周总理到科伦坡受到盛大欢迎
    新华社科伦坡1日电　锡兰总督奥利弗·古?狄莱克爵士在周恩来总理一行1月31日到达科伦坡以后，立即在女王大厦（总督府）接见了他们。
    新华社科伦坡1日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理一行在1月31日下午到达锡兰首都科伦坡时受到盛大的欢迎。
    聚集在像节日一样结着彩的拉特马拉纳机场上的一万锡兰人民，在中国总理走下飞机的时候高呼欢迎口号。锡兰总理班达拉奈克在靠近飞机舱口的地方迎接。
    中国总理和副总理沿着铺在地上的红色地毯走上讲台，接受三军联合仪仗队的敬礼，并且检阅了这支仪仗队。他们还被介绍给锡兰高级文武官员以及驻科伦坡的外交团成员。周恩来总理在一本黄金色的书上签名之后，向欢迎的群众讲话。他感谢班达拉奈克总理以及锡兰政府和人民邀请他到锡兰访问，并且转达了中国人民对锡兰人民的兄弟祝贺。他追述中国和锡兰自古以来的经济和文化联系，它们对于彼此的争取民族独立的斗争的相互同情和支持。他说，在两国都获得独立之后，“锡兰是最早承认中华人民共和国的国家之一”。
    他说，两国之间的友好关系过去几年来有了新的发展。“我们相信，在中国和锡兰正式建立了外交关系以后，我们的友谊和合作一定会有进一步的发展。”
    致词完毕，一群佛教和尚诵经祝福，其中有几个在锡兰访问的日本和尚敲击和平鼓。
    当周恩来总理走向欢迎的群众并且乘坐汽车离开机场经过十一英里的路程到市内去的时候，群众欢声雷动，挥手高呼口号不绝。中国客人的汽车队必须在拥集的群众中间通过狭窄的隙缝前进。
