    **The Roadside Dead**

    In recent days, under the assault of cold waves, people have been freezing to death on the streets in various parts of Taiwan. In Changhua City, a beggar named Cai Yi, due to "inadequate clothing to ward off the cold, curled up inside a temple," was frozen to death on the 12th. Chen Qifa, a resident of Gangshan Town, Kaohsiung County, froze to death in a public toilet on the 12th, due to the freezing weather and having nowhere to shelter. People also froze to death in Penghu and Chiayi. Several people also froze to death in the suburbs of Taipei.

    **"Blood Selling" People**

    Many people in Taiwan rely on selling blood to survive. In Taipei City alone, the number of people going to the Red Cross blood bank to sell blood is fifty to over a hundred per week, and even couples go to sell blood together. Many people also go to the National Taiwan University Hospital and Taipei Hospital to sell blood. Taiwanese newspapers say that people sell blood because they have no other means of making a living and have to be "cruel to themselves." Due to excessive blood withdrawal, their complexions have become very poor.

    **"Poor People Keep Out" Hospitals**

    The Chiang Kai-shek clique spends a large amount of expenditure on military and political expenses, and provides very little care for medical undertakings. Many public medical institutions rely entirely on charging patients to maintain themselves, so the charges are expensive. To be hospitalized, a patient must first pay a hospitalization deposit of 200 to 600 Taiwan dollars (equivalent to a month's salary for an ordinary public school teacher), and the cost of medical treatment is comparable to that of private hospitals. Therefore, poor people are "daunted" from being hospitalized. Some hospitals in Taiwan used to have some regulations for providing medical treatment to the poor, but now they have stopped providing medical treatment because the Taiwan authorities do not provide subsidies. Taiwanese newspapers say that hospitals refusing to admit patients without money and patients committing suicide due to poverty and illness often occur in various parts of Taiwan. Xia Dinghai, a porter in Taipei City, had his bone broken by a car. When he was sent to the National Taiwan University Hospital, the hospital refused to admit him because he had no money. As a result, he fell in the corridor of the emergency room of this hospital, moaning for four or five consecutive days, and no one ever cared. Yan Baoguo, a young man from Taichung County, died of poisoning because he had no money to treat his lung disease.

    **Shocking "Divorce Rate"**

    Today's Taiwan, the large number of divorces has become a serious social problem. According to statistics released by the Taipei "District Court," as of December 11 last year, the ratio of marriages notarized by the court to divorces was nine to one. Taiwanese newspapers believe that there are many reasons for so many divorce cases, but "the economy" is a "very important factor," because Taiwan is "currently in social turmoil, and the economic situation of each family lacks stability, which inevitably has a significant impact on causing family and marriage breakdown." Taiwanese newspapers say that because there are many divorced people, many divorced women who have no means of living have fallen into prostitution. Relief homes are crowded with orphans who lack parental care, and a group of psychologically disturbed children who have not received family warmth have appeared in society. They have become the "reserve force" for juvenile delinquency. (Xinhua News Agency)

    今日台湾
    路有冻死骨
    前些日子，在寒流侵袭下，台湾各地连日路有冻死骨。彰化市一个讨乞为生的男子蔡益，由于“衣不避寒，蜷曲庙内”，12日活活被冻死。高雄县冈山镇居民陈其发，天寒地冻，无地容身，12日冻死在公共厕所里。澎湖和嘉义等地都冻死了人。台北市郊也冻死了几个人。
    “卖血”的人
    台湾有不少人靠卖血来活命。仅在台北市，前往红十会血库卖血的人，每星期有五十人到一百多人，甚至有夫妇同去卖血的。前往台湾大学医院和台北医院卖血的人也很多。台湾报纸说，卖血的人都是由于没有别的谋生办法，只好“对自己残酷”。他们因抽血过多，脸色变得很坏。
    “穷人免进”医院
    蒋介石集团把大量开支耗费在军政开支上面，对医疗事业极少照顾，许多公立医疗机构都全靠向病人收费维持，因而收费昂贵。病人要住医院，首先就得交二百元到六百元台币（相当于普通公教人员一个月的薪金）的住院保证金，医药费之高和私人医院相差无几，因此穷人要住院的都“望而却步”。台湾有一些医院，过去还有替贫民施诊的一些规定，现在也因台湾当局不发补助费而纷纷停止施诊。台湾报纸说，台湾各地常常发生医院拒收没有钱的病人和病人因贫病交迫而自杀的事件。台北市搬运工人夏定海被车撞断骨，送到台湾大学医院，因他没有钱，医院不准他住院，结果他倒在这个医院急诊室的走廊内，一连四五天，辗转呻吟，始终无人过问。台中县青年颜宝国，因患肺病无钱医，服毒死去。
    触目惊心的“离婚率”
    今日的台湾，离婚之多已成为严重的社会问题。台北“地方法院”发表统计，到去年12月11日止，经该院公证结婚与离婚的比例是九比一。台湾报纸认为，有这样多的离婚案件，原因当然很多，但“经济”却是一个“很重要的因素”，因台湾“目前社会动乱，每个家庭经济情况缺乏稳定，对于造成家庭与婚姻破裂，自难免不无重大影响。”台湾报纸说，由于离婚的人多，已经使许多离了婚而生活没有依靠的妇女沦落火坑。各救济院挤满了缺乏父母照顾的孤儿，并且社会上出现了一群没有得到家庭温暖的心理变态的儿童。他们成了少年犯罪的“后备军”。　（新华社讯）
