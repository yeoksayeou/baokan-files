Sights and Sounds of South America

Theaters in Montevideo

Montevideo has two national theaters. One is the national "Solís" Theater, which does not have a permanent troupe. The Chinese Art Troupe performed in this theater. The other is the municipal "Solis" Theater, which has its own opera and drama troupes that perform in rotation. The "Solis" Theater just celebrated its 100th anniversary in August of last year. It is one of the few oldest theaters in South America. On August 25, 1856, the theater premiered Verdi's opera "Ernani," which depicts the story of an ancient female patriot. This year, the opera was restaged. An actor told us that the theater's choice of this opera was easy to understand because patriotism and independence are the themes most loved by the public in South American countries for a century.

The Chinese Art Troupe's performance aroused great interest in the Uruguayan theater community. People commented that this comprehensive form was a so-called "unique" drama. The Chilean playwright Artus praised Chinese classical drama as "omnipotent" drama, and this sentence was widely circulated. Therefore, Chinese actors and artists easily established a deep friendship with their Uruguayan counterparts. When Chinese artists visited the "Solis" Theater, the entire theater treated us like a festival. When the Chinese Art Troupe gave a report on the history and performance methods of Chinese classical drama at another theater called "Victoria," the theater, which could only accommodate 1,000 people, was crammed with more than half as many audience members as fixed seats. The friends from the "University Theater" who hosted the event were worried about an accident in the theater building. When the Chinese artists who participated in the sample performance appeared, they were immediately surrounded and asked for autographs until the local friends repeatedly shouted to the people, "The Chinese guests have a performance tonight!", and the crowd made way.

But what aroused our interest even more was the Uruguayan "Independent Theater." This is an amateur or semi-professional theater, not like the municipal theater that can receive government funding. The performances are mostly realistic and social, and people often compare them with Ibsen's problem plays, that is to say, these theaters often perform plays about social problems, and the actors are mostly teachers, doctors, journalists, students, etc. We watched the "University Theater" perform "The Merchant Inn," which was adapted from Maupassant's novel "Boule de Suif." This play tells people that those self-proclaimed noble superiors are morally lower than a prostitute. The performance was very popular with the audience.

Another one, called the "Round Theater," has only more than three hundred seats in the audience. There is no stage. The audience surrounds a circle, and the actors perform in the center of the courtyard. Sometimes, the actors walk into the center of the brightly lit courtyard from the audience. The performance we visited was called "The Isabel柯林Case", writing a story about a underage working class daughter forced into prostitution being charged with a crime, said to be a true story, the case is still not adjudicated. The whole story unfolds in the courtroom, and the audience is as if sitting in the gallery of the courtroom. The actors' realistic acting method was a great success. After the performance of the entire play, the audience immediately held a discussion in the theater. People elected a well-known local doctor as chairman and launched a heated debate. An American female professor doubted the authenticity and typicality of the story depicted in the drama. A Mexican doctor said that this is a fact that happens every day. A local housewife, in the name of a mother, called on people to pay attention to the social issues raised by this realistic drama. The actors, without removing their makeup, also joined in, and the discussion barely ended until one o'clock in the night, and there were still many audience members who wanted to speak.

We were deeply moved by the moving, earnest, and serious attitude shown in this discussion.

    南美见闻	赵沨
    蒙得维的亚的剧院
    蒙得维的亚有两个国家剧院，一个是没有固定剧团的国立“苏德列”剧院，中国艺术团便是在这个剧院演出的。另一个叫市立“苏列士”剧院，有着自己的歌剧团和话剧团，经常轮流演出。“苏列士”剧院在去年8月刚刚庆祝了建院一百周年纪念，是南美洲各国少数几个最古老的剧院之一。1856年8月25日，这个剧院首次演出，剧目是维尔第的歌剧“欧娜尼”，描写古代的一个女爱国者的故事。今年又重新演出了这个剧目。一位演员告诉我们，这个剧院选择这个剧目是很容易了解的，因为，爱国和独立正是南美各国公众百年来最喜爱的主题。
    中国艺术团的演出引起了乌拉圭戏剧界极大的兴趣，人们评论这种综合形式是一种所谓“唯一的”戏剧。而智利的名戏剧家阿尔图斯称赞中国古典戏剧为“全能的”戏剧这句话，更是传诵一时。因而，中国演员艺术家和乌拉圭同行们很容易便建立了深厚的友谊，中国艺术家到“苏列士”剧院参观时，全院像节日一样的接待了我们。中国艺术团在另一个叫做“维多利亚”的剧院举行关于中国古典戏剧的历史和表现方法的报告时，只能容纳一千人的剧场挤进了比固定座位多一半的听众，主持者的“大学剧院”的朋友们一直担心这个剧场的建筑发生意外。参加示例演出的中国艺术家们出场时立即被包围着要求签名，直到当地的朋友再三向人们大喊：“中国客人今晚立即还要演出呢！”，群众才让开一条道路来。
    但更引起我们的兴趣的是乌拉圭的“独立剧院”，这是一种业余的或半职业的剧院，不是像市立剧院那样可以得到政府的经费补助。演出的节目大多具有现实性和社会性，人们常以之和易卜生的问题剧相提，就是说这类剧院演出的常是社会问题的剧目，演员大多是教师、医生、记者、学生等。我们看了“大学剧院”演出的“招商客栈”，是根据莫泊桑的小说“羊脂球”改编的，这个剧目告诉人们，那些自命高贵的上等人在道德上比一个妓女要低下得多。演出很受观众欢迎。
    另一个叫做“圆形剧场”的，观众席只有三百多个座位，没有舞台，观众围成一个圈，演员就在大庭的中心来表演，有时，演员就在观众席中走进有灯光的大庭中心。我们参观的演出叫“伊莎白·柯林案件”，写一个未成年的工人的女儿被迫为妓女而被控告的案件，据说这是真人真事，这个案件至今还未判决。故事全部在法庭中展开，观众就像是坐在法庭的旁听席上。演员们的现实主义演剧方法获得了很大的成功。在全剧演出终了后观众立即在剧场举行讨论，人们推举一位当地著名的医生作主席，展开了热烈的争论。一位来自美国的女教授怀疑这个戏剧描写的故事的真实性和典型性，一位来自墨西哥的医生说这是天天在发生的事实。而当地一位家庭主妇以母亲的名义呼吁人们重视这个现实主义戏剧所提出的社会问题。演员们没有卸装也参加了进来，直到夜深一时才勉强结束了讨论，而要求发言的观众还有很多位呢。
    我们深为这个讨论会所表现的动人的认真、严肃的态度所感动。
