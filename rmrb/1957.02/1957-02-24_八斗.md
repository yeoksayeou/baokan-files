    Eight Pecks (Fable)
　　Wu Yan
    In the morning, he bought eight pecks of rice from a rice shop.
    In the afternoon, his child suddenly fell ill and needed medical expenses, so he carried the eight pecks of rice, unopened, back to the rice shop to sell them.
    The people at the rice shop measured it with a peck measure and said that each peck was short by five "he" (合, a unit of dry measure, about 0.1 liter), so in total, it was only seven pecks and six "sheng" (升, a unit of dry measure, about 1 liter), so they could only pay for seven pecks and six "sheng."
    "It's clearly eight pecks -- didn't I just buy it from your shop this morning?"
    "It's clearly seven pecks and six 'sheng' -- wasn't this the same peck measure we used this morning?"
    He was stunned. He looked closely at the peck measure. From the outside, it was indeed the same peck measure. -- Unfortunately, he didn't see that when measuring the rice in the morning, there was a thick wooden board equivalent to five "he" in volume installed at the bottom of the peck measure.
    This was of course a trick of profiteering from the old society. But in our new society, it seems that there are still some comrades who, when measuring the interests of themselves and others, intentionally or unintentionally install or remove a thick wooden board, not only thinking that they are "highly talented," but also admiring their fairness and selflessness because they are using the same peck measure.

    八斗（寓言）
　　吴岩
    上午，他在一家米店里买了八斗米。
    下午，家中小孩忽然得了急病，需要一笔医药费，于是他又把那八斗米原封不动地背到那家米店里去卖掉。
    米店里的人用斗一量，说是每斗都缺了五合米，总共算起来，不过是七斗六升，因此只能付七斗六升的钱。
    “明明是八斗啊——不就是上午才从你们店里买去的吗？”
    “明明是七斗六啊——上午量的时候不就是这只斗吗？”
    他怔住了，他打量着那只斗。从外形上看，的确就是那只斗。——可惜他没有看见：上午量米的时候，斗底里安装着一块相当于五合容量的厚木板。
    这当然是旧社会里唯利是图的把戏。但在我们这个新社会里，好像也还有些同志，在衡量人我之际，有意无意地安上或卸下了一块厚木板，不仅因此而自以为“才高八斗”，并且因为用的就是这一只斗而在欣赏自己的公平无私哩。
