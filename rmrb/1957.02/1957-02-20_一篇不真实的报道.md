Reader's Letters

    An Untrue Report
    Comrade Editor:
    The article "The Story of Quality Inspection" written by Comrade Zhao Decheng, published on page 2 of your newspaper on December 22nd of last year, is baffling. The article is about Qu Yongchun, a private-side inspector at the Shenyang Dadong Lumber Mill. However, there is no such person at the Shenyang Dadong Lumber Mill. Only our Dongfang Lumber Mill has a private-side inspector who is quite active in his work, but his name is Qu Yongzhong, not Qu Yongchun, and he hasn't done so many things as described in the article. Therefore, most comrades in the Shenyang lumber industry believe that "The Story of Quality Inspection" written by Zhao Decheng is about a fictitious person and fictitious events. We hope you will investigate and give us a reply.
      Shenyang Dongfang Lumber Mill, Yang Youtai
    Comrade Editor:
    "The Story of Quality Inspection" was told to me by Qu Yongzhong, a private-side person from the Shenyang Public-Private Joint Dongfang Lumber Mill. At the time, I felt that his deeds were very educational, so I wrote it into a manuscript and made some "artistic embellishments." Because it was not a true story, I did not write the name of the factory, and I also changed the name of the person. This manuscript was originally intended to be submitted to your newspaper's supplement as a literary work, but it was not specified when I submitted it. Later, when your newspaper called to ask which factory the facts in the article referred to, I just casually mentioned a factory name. This shows that I was not serious and responsible in my attitude towards writing the manuscript. In addition to a profound self-criticism, I guarantee that I will not make such a mistake again in the future. Zhao Decheng

    一篇不真实的报道
    编辑同志：
    你报去年12月22日二版刊登的赵德成同志写的“质量检查的故事”一文，使人看了莫名其妙。文中写的是沈阳大东制材厂私方检查人员曲永春的故事，但是，沈阳大东制材厂并没有这样一个人；只有我们东方制材厂有个私方检查人员，工作比较积极，但名字叫曲永仲，并不叫曲永春，也没有像文章中所写的那么多事情。因此，我们沈阳市制材行业的大多数同志都认为赵德成所写的“质量检查的故事”是假人假事，希望你们调查了解并给答复。
      沈阳市东方制材厂　杨有泰
    编辑同志：
    “质量检查的故事”是我听沈阳市公私合营东方制材厂私方人员曲永仲讲的。当时，我觉得他的事迹很有教育意义，就把它写成了稿子，并且作了一些“艺术加工”。因为它不是真实的事情，也就没有写厂名，人名也改了另一个名字。这篇稿子本来是准备作为文艺作品投给你报副刊用的，但是投稿时没有写明。以后你报来电话问及文中写的事实是那个厂子，当时，我就随便说了一个厂名。这说明我在写稿的态度上是不够严肃负责的。我除了深刻检讨外，并保证以后不再犯这样的错误。　赵德成
