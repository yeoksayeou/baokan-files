Xinhua News Agency: A new type of open-style heat processing plant, designed by engineer Yang Yun and others from the Architectural Engineering Department's Design Institute, has been successfully created. This type of plant has good ventilation and can reduce construction costs by 40% compared to closed-style plants. At the Second Member Representative Assembly of the Architectural Society of China, which closed on the 20th, architect Yang Yun gave a special presentation on this design.

Most of the factory buildings in our country are currently closed. Ventilation inside the workshops mainly relies on skylights on the roof and side windows on the four walls. General heat processing plants, such as forging plants and foundry plants, have very high workshop temperatures. In summer, especially in some factories in the south, simply opening the skylights and side windows is not enough to lower the temperature inside the workshop. Therefore, a lot of money is spent on increasing cooling equipment. With the newly designed open-style plant, glass skylights and side windows are not used. In the place where the skylights were originally installed, only some columns are left to support the roof, forming a long ventilation duct in the upper part of the roof. In the place where side windows were originally installed on the four walls, several layers of asbestos tile sunshades are used instead, in the form of fixed louvers. This allows for continuous and organized natural ventilation inside the workshop, and the temperature inside the workshop will not exceed 35 degrees Celsius even during the hottest time of summer. However, this type of plant is not suitable for use in the colder north.

The Architectural Engineering Department has now adopted this plan to build forging plants, heat treatment plant boiler rooms in the southwest, and plans to promote it in the south.

    通风好造价低的热加工厂房
    据新华社讯　一种新的开敞式的热加工厂房，已由建筑工程部设计院的工程师杨芸等设计成功。这种厂房通风良好，而且比封闭式厂房可以减少建设费40％。在20日闭幕的中国建筑学会第二届会员代表大会上，建筑师杨芸就这一设计作了专题介绍。
    我国目前的厂房大多数是封闭式的，车间内的通风主要靠屋顶上的天窗和四壁的侧窗，一般热加工厂如锻造厂、铸工厂等车间温度很高，在夏天特别是在南方的一些工厂仅靠打开天窗和侧窗还很难降低车间内的温度，因而要用很多钱增加降温设备。以新设计的敞开式厂房，不用玻璃的天窗和侧窗，在原来安装天窗的地方仅留一些柱子撑住屋顶，在屋顶上部形成一条长长的通风道，在四壁原来安装侧窗的地方也改用数层石棉瓦做的遮阳板，形式就像固定的百叶窗。这样就可以使车间内持续不断的进行有组织的自然通风，夏天最热时车间内的温度也不会超过摄氏三十五度。不过这种厂房不适宜于设在较冷的北方。
    现在建筑工程部已采用这个方案在西南建设锻工厂、热处理厂锅炉房，还准备在南方推广。
