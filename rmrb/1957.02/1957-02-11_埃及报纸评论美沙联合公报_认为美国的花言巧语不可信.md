Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 10th.

    Egyptian newspaper "Al Masaa" on the 9th expressed doubt as to whether the clauses in the joint communiqué issued by US President Eisenhower and Saudi Arabian King Saud could be fulfilled.
    The newspaper said: "It is good to state on paper that the Middle East issue should be resolved through peaceful means, but judging from past and present actions, these words do not seem to be implemented fairly."
    The newspaper pointed out that Egypt and Britain also had similar agreements, but "less than two years after the agreement was signed, Britain rallied France and Israel to attack Egypt."
    "Al Masaa" said that if the purpose of American policy is to solve international problems by peaceful means, then "why would the Eisenhower Plan cause so much uproar, and why try to show that the Middle East is under the threat of external attack?"
    The newspaper said that the only external attacks Egypt has suffered in the past decade have come from Britain, France, and Israel.
    "Al Masaa" said: "We cannot be satisfied with what is written on paper." The newspaper cited the Baghdad Pact as an example, saying that one of the purposes written on paper in the Baghdad Pact is to "strengthen peace" and "respect the United Nations Charter," but in the past two years, its only work has been to threaten the peace of the region and show no respect for the Charter.
    "Al-Ahram" also published a commentary on the same day saying, "We have reason to doubt the results of documents issued by the West."

    埃及报纸评论美沙联合公报
    认为美国的花言巧语不可信
    新华社开罗10日电　埃及“晚报”9日对美国总统艾森豪威尔和沙特阿拉伯国王沙特所发表的联合公报中的条款是否能履行表示怀疑。
    这家报纸说：“在纸上写明中东问题应该通过和平办法来解决，这是好事，但是，从过去和目前的一些行动看，这些话似乎并不会得到公正的履行。”
    这家报纸指出，埃及和英国也有类似的协定，但是“在协定签字后还不到两年，英国就纠集法国和以色列进攻了埃及”。
    “晚报”说，如果美国政策的目的是用和平手段解决国际问题的话，那么，“为什么艾森豪威尔计划会引起这么许多喧哗，为什么要力图表明中东正在外界进攻的威胁之下？”
    这家报纸说，埃及在过去十年间所遭到的唯一的外界的进攻是来自英国、法国和以色列。
    “晚报”说：“我们不能满足于纸上写的东西。”这家报纸举巴格达条约为例说，巴格达条约在纸上所写的宗旨之一是“加强和平”和“尊重联合国宪章”，而在过去两年间，它的唯一的工作是威胁这个地区的和平，对宪章毫不尊重。
    “开罗报”在同一天发表的评论也说，“我们有理由怀疑西方所签发的文件的结果”。
