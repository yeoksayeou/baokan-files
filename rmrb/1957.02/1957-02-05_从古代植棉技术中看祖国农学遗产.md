Looking at the Agricultural Heritage of the Motherland from Ancient Cotton Planting Techniques
		Hua Central Agricultural Science Institute, Wang Ying

Among China's major crops, cotton was introduced relatively late. In ancient times, the raw materials for clothing were mainly silk and hemp. The use of cotton only gradually became widespread in the late Song and early Yuan dynasties (around the late 12th and early 13th centuries). By the early 14th century, cotton was planted in provinces throughout the Yangtze and Yellow River basins, and cotton fiber had replaced silk and hemp in many ways, showing a trend of "having cotton without silkworms, and batting without hemp."

Although the history of cotton planting in central China is less than a thousand years, China, as an ancient agricultural country, had accumulated extremely rich agricultural experience before the introduction of cotton. After the introduction of cotton, this existing agricultural experience was specifically applied to cotton, and further developed and created, forming cotton yield-increasing techniques. Therefore, China's heritage of cotton cultivation is still quite rich.

Starting with the "Nong Sang Ji Yao" compiled by the Si Nong Si of the Yuan Dynasty in 1273, China had specialized cotton literature. There are even more cotton literature works in the Ming and Qing dynasties. These documents can basically be divided into two categories: one is compilation-based, and the other is summary-based. The "Mu Mian Bu Hui Kao" in the "Cao Mu Dian" of the "Gu Jin Tu Shu Ji Cheng Bo Wu Hui Bian", "Mu Mian" in "Qin Ding Shou Shi Tong Kao" and "Mu Mian Hua" in "Guang Qun Fang Pu" belong to the former category, while "Mu Mian" in "Nong Sang Ji Yao", "Mu Mian" in "Wang Zhen Nong Shu", "Mian Pu" in "Qun Fang Pu", "Mu Mian" in Volume 35 of "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" and "Zhi Mian Zuan Yao" belong to the latter category.

In addition to the above-mentioned agricultural books, some scattered cotton materials can also be found in travel notes, biographies, poetry, and local chronicles of various cotton-growing areas. Also, since cotton is also a kind of Chinese medicinal material, relevant records of cotton can be found in Materia Medica classics, such as Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica," which has a section on the origin and types of cotton in China.

All these materials are important basis for studying ancient cotton industry in China, but unfortunately, some valuable materials such as Zhang Wudian's "Zhong Mian Fa", Xu Guangqi's "Ji Bei Shu" and "Nong Yi Shi Shu" may have been lost, which is a great loss.

Here, due to space limitations, it is impossible to comprehensively discuss the heritage of cotton planting technology in China. Only a few examples are given below to briefly explain what the author knows.

For example, in terms of cotton field cultivation, China knew very early on that cotton fields should be plowed early and deeply. Wang Xiangjin's "Qun Fang Pu" in the late Ming Dynasty advocated that after picking the cotton, the cotton stalks should be removed immediately, followed by deep plowing, so that "the Yang and harmonious Qi can be buried in the soil." In the drier northern regions, to avoid moisture loss, it should be "smoothed immediately after plowing to prevent wind drying" (see the aforementioned book and Zhang Zongfa's "San Nong Ji" and other books of the Qing Dynasty). For rice-cotton rotation areas in the south, autumn plowing should be carried out after harvesting rice, and after plowing, "it should not be finely harrowed, but large clods should be built up, allowing them to solidify, and the soil will become fine and moist when the frost melts next year" (see Xu Guangqi's "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" of the late Ming Dynasty). It is then finely harrowed during spring plowing. This differentiated approach is still used in both northern and southern cotton areas.

The cotton field ridging is particularly detailed. In ancient times, cotton fields were mostly narrow ridges, with only one row of cotton planted on each ridge. For example, "Nong Sang Ji Yao" advocates: "Each ridge is eight steps long and one step wide, with half a step for the ridge surface and half a step for the ridge back." "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" also advocates that after ridging and before sowing cotton, the land should be hoeed three or four times to make the soil fine, weed-free, and the ridge surface flat and smooth. It also says: "Hoeing once when the weeds are white is equivalent to hoeing twice when they are green, because it removes the weeds from their buds."

"Geng Xin Nong Hua" in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty proposed setting up a ditch and a ridge (terrace) between two ridges. The ditch is convenient for drainage, and the terrace is convenient for standing. The soil from opening the ditch is added to the back of the ridge, which is also conducive to ventilation. However, in ancient times, there were also wide ridges. For example, "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" records that the ridges in Yuyao Haiyuan (ie, the seaside) at that time were one zhang wide, with the ridge surface "high in the middle and low on the sides," and the ridge ditches were two or three chi deep and wide, which could also facilitate drainage.

Cotton seeds have thick seed coats and are difficult to germinate, so seed treatment techniques are very important. The ancients had also mastered this point very early on. For example, "Nong Sang Ji Yao" says: Before sowing cotton, "wash the seeds with water, pile them on damp ground, and cover them with a tile pot overnight. Take them out the next day and rub them neatly with small ash, and then sow them." "Covering with a tile pot overnight" can better keep warm and moist, and enhance the effect of germination. Mixing with small ash facilitates sowing and emergence. "Nong Sang Yi Shi Cuo Yao" in the fourteenth century and "Bian Min Tu Zuan" in the Ming Dynasty advocated soaking the cotton seeds first, mixing them with ash evenly, and then sowing them after they germinate.

"Nong Pu Bian Lan" and "Yu Ti Mian Hua Tu", which were made in the middle of the eighteenth century, also contain a method of hot water soaking, saying: cotton seeds are first splashed with boiling water, then mixed with snow water and plant ash evenly, and then sown. Many people think that the method of hot water soaking of cotton seeds was introduced from abroad, but they do not know that China had already used this method in production.

The ancients also understood the principle of timely sowing very well. For example, "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" quoted Zhang Wudian's planting method and said: "It is not advisable to sow late, otherwise it will be cold in autumn; it is not advisable to sow early, otherwise the peaches will not bear fruit, and even if they do, they will not be very large, and the flowers will be soft and without lint." "Qun Fang Pu" also said: "It is not advisable to sow early, for fear that spring frost will injure the seedlings, and it is not advisable to sow late, for fear that autumn frost will injure the peaches." When is the appropriate time to sow? "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" proposed a specific time, saying that the cotton sowing period should be "five days before Qingming as the best time, five days later as the middle time, and Guyu as the lower time, and it should never be later than Guyu." "Nong Can Jing" written by Pu Songling in the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty said: "Roughly between Qingming and Guyu, depending on the cold and warmth, sow it slightly earlier. Although the seedlings are not fat, the nodes are dense and there are many peaches. If it is late, the seedlings will be strong but the peaches will be sparse." In addition, many other ancient books also advocated early sowing. At present, the cotton sowing period in various parts of China is generally late. The ancients' advocacy of early sowing to make full use of the frost-free period provides us with some enlightenment for studying the sowing period problem.

However, early sowing is prone to seed rot and missing seedlings. Xu Guangqi analyzed four reasons for this, namely, imprecise seed selection, broadcast sowing without covering soil, too dense sowing, and poor soil fertility. At the same time, it also proposed four methods to prevent missing seedlings due to early sowing: precise selection of cotton seeds, increased fertilization, sparse planting, and covering the soil and compacting after sowing. In addition, for land with more ground silkworms, methods should be found to catch and kill the ground silkworms; for land with green manure turned over, the turning over should be even to prevent the green manure from burning the seeds and rotting the buds during fermentation. Among these technologies, except for the sparse planting, which needs to be studied, all the other technologies are definitely correct and still have their practical significance today.

There were also three types of sowing methods used for cotton in ancient times: spot sowing, broadcast sowing, and row sowing. Spot sowing was generally advocated. The spot sowing method recorded in "Qun Fang Pu" is more detailed. It says: After the land is cultivated, make a hole every one chi in the sowing ditch, pour one or two bowls of water into the hole, and after the water seeps into the soil, sow four or five seeds, cover the seeds with one bowl of mature manure, and then cover with one or two fingers thick of soil, and compact it with your feet instead of pressing. For broadcast sowing and row sowing, it must also be leveled with a "wooden clod crusher" or compacted with a "stone roller."

"Applying fertilizer with the seeds" can timely supply the crop with nutrients in the seedling stage, make the seedlings grow strong, and save fertilizer, so it is still regarded as an advanced agricultural technology at present. However, in China, this method has also been used in production for a long time. For example, "Qun Fang Pu" and "San Nong Ji" both advocate that when there is little manure, "manure should be used with the seeds." This manure must be rotted to avoid burning the seeds and rotting the buds, and it is said that it is best to use rotted sesame cake.

"Geng Xin Nong Hua" also advocates mixing mature manure with mud after opening the hole, padding the bottom for sowing, covering it with "seedling ash" after sowing, and then gently pressing it, and moistening it with a little water. In addition, "Fu Jun Nong Chan Kao Lue", which was written at the end of the nineteenth century, also records that when spot sowing cotton, human urine is used to irrigate it, "and black ash and yellow soil are used to cover the seeds," and fire manure is also used to cover the seeds. The method of covering seeds with fire manure is still popular in southern cotton areas.

In terms of weeding and soil cultivation in cotton fields, the ancients advocated early hoeing, diligent hoeing, and fine hoeing, requiring that the grass be hoeed seven times before the summer solstice, and thinning and fixing seedlings in combination with hoeing three times. For example, Hu Sanxing's note in "Zi Zhi Tong Jian" of the Yuan Dynasty said: Cotton "must be weeded three times a month after planting." "Nong Sang Ji Yao" said: Cotton fields "must always be kept clean." "Nong Sang Yi Shi Cuo Yao" said: Cotton fields must be "diligently hoeed." "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" also said: Hoeing cotton "must be extremely meticulous," hoeing must be done more than seven times, and it must be done before the summer solstice. As the saying goes: Hoeing flowers should take advantage of the plum rain season, and the hoe grows three inches when it lands.

The principle of early hoeing of the first grass is still valued by old farmers. Ancient books also advocated hoeing the first grass when the cotton has two cotyledons. Zhang Wudian and Wang Xiangjin both agreed that: when hoeing and thinning for the first time, it is advisable to keep the cotton seedlings densely in case of damage, and it is still advisable to keep them slightly dense when hoeing again, and the seedlings will be fixed when hoeing for the third time. "Zhi Mian Zuan Yao" described the combination of weeding and thinning in more detail. It combines the amount of seedlings kept in the first two times with the weather. If the weather is still very cold, keep more, and if it is warm, keep less.

Hoeing cotton can also be combined with topdressing and soil cultivation. For example, Zhang Wudian's planting method said: After hoeing three times, the cotton seedlings are tall, and half a liter of mature manure is used to cultivate each seedling. "Zhi Mian Zuan Yao" said: "The method of hoeing and weeding should be two or three inches close to the roots, loosen the soil, and the remaining soil should be used to protect the roots. Then the soil will be loose and the roots will be deeply protected, so that the seedlings will be drought-resistant and resistant to wind and rain."

Combining various technical measures can simultaneously supply the comprehensive factors needed for crop life. It also saves labor. Modern mechanized farming technology still uses intertillage in combination with topdressing and soil cultivation, which shows the inheritance relationship between modern agricultural technology and ancient agricultural technology.

In the "Nong Sang Ji Yao" of the 13th century, there were already records about cotton topping and pruning, saying that when cotton grows to two chi high, the rushing heart should be removed, and when the side branches grow to one and a half chi, the heart should also be removed, so that the cotton plant can bear flowers and fruits in a non-empty section. By "Qun Fang Pu", cotton topping and pruning in China had become a fairly advanced, complex and meticulous technical work. The book not only mentioned the length of the main stem and side branches of cotton when topping and pruning, but also established the result of the combination of density and pruning, which should reach the standard of "do not let the branches cross and rub each other." It also proposed that the top heart or side heart should be hit once each in the "San Fu Tian", and should be removed on sunny days to prevent rainwater from entering the wound and causing the cotton branches to rot. Also, because the growth rate of cotton branches varies, the topping and pruning work should not be required to be completed at one time, but should be "removed at any time when the branches grow up, and there is no need to be strictly adhered to."

At present, there are still many areas in China that do not carry out cotton topping and pruning, and some are very unrefined even if they do, not "removing at any time, and there is no need to be strictly adhered to," but are greedy for saving trouble and completing it at one time, often causing reduced production. This phenomenon is not so much that advanced technology has not been adopted, but rather that the ancient methods of our country have been forgotten and lost.

In terms of seed selection, China has long had the habit of selecting "zhong pen hua" (cotton flowers in the middle of the cotton plant) as seeds. As Wang Zhen's "Nong Shu" said: "The seeds that are planted, those that are harvested first are not solid, and those that are near frost are also unusable. Only those harvested in the middle of the month are the best." All subsequent books record this. At the end of the nineteenth century, Wang Shushan's "Zhong Mian Fa" gave further explanation on this method, saying: "Pick the flowers in three times. After the first picking, after half a month, pick the second time, and after another half a month, pick the third time. The flowers picked the second time should be selected as the best to be used as seeds." This method of selecting "zhong pen hua" is also combined with boll selection, and there are also records of combining with plant selection or petal selection.

The Soviet Union mostly advocated selecting the first batch of harvested flowers as seeds. Therefore, at the beginning of liberation, some people wanted to use this to negate China's experience of selecting "zhong pen hua." However, the natural conditions in the Soviet Union are different from those in China. The Soviet Union has a higher latitude and a shorter growing season. It is possible that only the seeds of the first batch of flowers are fully mature. China's habit of keeping "zhong pen hua" as seeds has been passed down from ancient times and has been popularized throughout the country. It must have its own reasons and should never be easily negated.

The ancients also had a fairly deep understanding of the importance of seed selection by grain size. More than 300 years ago, "Qun Fang Pu" pointed out that: cotton seeds that are "old, shriveled, oily, wet, steamed, and baked with fire are all unsuitable for seed. When seeding, moisten with water, and after half a moment, wash out those that are unusable, all floating on the water, and those that are firm and undamaged will sink, take them and use them, and the seedlings will be lush."

Xu Guangqi also listed the failure to carry out seed selection by grain size or imprecise seed selection by grain size as one of the four major reasons for reduced cotton production and missing seedlings due to early sowing in "Nong Zheng Quan Shu", and also listed seed selection by grain size as the main method to increase production and prevent missing seedlings due to early sowing. To this day, seed selection by grain size is still an important cotton planting technology.

In addition, in terms of seed soaking, ancient books also record the methods of soaking seeds with snow water in the twelfth lunar month and eel juice, saying that this can make cotton cold-resistant, drought-resistant, and resistant to wind and rain. In terms of preventing missing seedlings due to early sowing, Xu Guangqi proposed in "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" to first plant barley or broad beans in the cotton field, and then turn them into the soil to plant cotton, and the cotton seedlings will be cold-resistant, and said that this "can be planted half a month or ten days earlier than other fields." In terms of thinning, the ancients all advocated thinning out the excessively large and excessively small cotton seedlings, and keeping the medium cotton seedlings, saying that although the large seedlings have luxuriant branches and leaves, they bear fewer peaches. In terms of crop rotation, it is advocated to adopt a short-term rotation system of "planting cotton for two years and rotating rice for one year" in rice-cotton rotation areas, saying that this can make "grass roots rot, the soil is fertile, and insects and borers do not grow." For wheat-cotton double cropping areas, Xu Guangqi had already proposed to start from improving the wheat and cotton sowing methods to overcome the contradiction between double cropping and increasing production. He advocated using spot sowing for wheat and spot sowing or broadcast sowing for cotton. All these yield-increasing technologies are worthy of our renewed research and determination.

In short, the richness of China's agricultural heritage can be seen from the ancient cotton planting technology. At present, under the call of "marching towards science" and "sorting out the scientific heritage of the motherland," studying the agricultural heritage of our country is the glorious task of our agricultural science workers. In the field of agricultural science in our country, before liberation, we blindly imitated Europe and the United States and worshiped the West; after liberation, some agricultural workers only regarded the Soviet Union as correct and ignored the characteristics of agricultural production in our country. Soviet advanced experience must be learned, but we must also understand the actual situation in our country. We now bear the great responsibility of "carrying on the past and opening up the future," that is, carrying on the "past" of our agricultural heritage and opening up the "future" of socialist agricultural construction. I hope that agricultural science workers across the country will work together to encourage each other.

    从古代植棉技术中看祖国农学遗产	华中农业科学研究所　王缨
    在我国各主要农作物中，以棉花的引进较迟。古代我国人民的服被原料主要是靠丝麻，宋末元初（约当十二世纪末十三世纪初）用棉才逐渐普遍。到了十四世纪初期，棉花即在长江、黄河流域各省种植，棉纤维即在多方面代替了丝麻，已呈“不蚕而绵，不麻而絮”之势。
    我国中部各省的植棉历史虽还不到千年，但由于我国是个农业古国，在棉花未引入前，即已积累了极其丰富的农业经验，待棉花引入后，将已有农业经验具体用之于棉花，加以发挥创造，即形成棉花增产技术，所以我国棉花栽培学遗产仍是相当丰富的。
    自1273年元代司农司撰的“农桑辑要”起，我国便有了专门的棉业文献，明、清两代的棉业文献更多。这些文献基本上可以分为两类，一类是汇编性质的，另一类是总结性质的。清代古今图书集成博物汇编草木典中的“木棉部汇考”、钦定授时通考中的“木棉”和广群芳谱中的“木棉花”等属于前一类，而农桑辑要中的“木棉”、王祯农书中的“木棉”、群芳谱中的“棉谱”、农政全书卷三十五的“木棉”和植棉纂要等则属于后一类。
    除以上各农书外，在游记、传记、诗咏和各棉区地方志中也可以找到一些零碎的棉花材料。又由于棉花也是一种中药药材，所以在本草典籍中也可以找到有关棉花的记载，如李时珍本草纲目中即有一节谈到我国棉花的起源和种类。
    所有这些材料，都是研究我国古代植棉业的重要依据，只可惜有些宝贵材料如张五典“种棉法”、徐光启“吉贝疏”和农遗什疏等，据目前了解，可能已是失传了，这是个很大的损失。
    这里，由于篇幅的关系，不可能对我国植棉技术遗产进行全面的论述。仅就作者所知，举出下列数例略加说明。
    如在棉田耕作方面，我国很早就知道棉田应早耕、深耕，明末王象晋群芳谱即主张在拾花完毕后，立刻拔去棉杆，随深耕之，以便“令阳和之气掩入土内”。在较干旱的北方地区，为避免跑墒，耕后应“随捞平，不致风干”（见前书及清张宗法三农纪等书）。而对于南方稻棉轮作区，收获水稻后，即行秋耕，而在耕后，“不宜耙细，须大墢岸起，令其凝冱，来年冻释，土脉细润”（见明末徐光启农政全书），春耕时再耙细，这一区别对待办法，至今仍为南北棉区所采用。
    在棉田作畦方面，尤为细致，古时棉田多为窄畦，每畦仅植棉一行。如农桑辑要主张：“每畦长八步，阔一步，内半步作畦面，半步作畦背”。农政全书还主张在作畦后，播棉前，锄地三、四次，以使土细、草净、畦面平整。并说：“锄白一当锄青二，去草自其芽蘖故”。
    清道光年间的耕心农话提出两畦间设一畎一畛（埂子），畎便于排水，畛便以立脚，再利用开畎的土加于畦背上，又利于通风。但古时也有作宽畦的，如农政全书载，当时余姚海堧（即海边）的畦宽为一丈，畦面“中高旁下”，畦沟深广各二、三尺，这样也能便于排水。
    棉籽种皮较厚，出苗较难，所以很讲究种子处理技术。对于这点，古人也早已掌握，如农桑辑要即称：在播棉前，用水淘过子粒，堆于湿地上，瓦盆复一夜，次日取出，用小灰搓得伶俐，然后播种。“瓦盆复一夜”，较能保温保湿，增强催芽效力，小灰拌后便于播种出苗。十四世纪的农桑衣食撮要和明代的便民图纂，则主张先将棉籽浸湿，以灰拌匀，待生芽后，再行播种。
    作于十八世纪中的农圃便览和御题棉花图，还载有开水汤种办法，说：棉籽先用开水泼过，再用雪水、草木灰拌匀，然后播种。对棉籽开水汤种一法，有不少人以为是从外国传入的，而不知我国早已将此法用在生产上了。
    对于适时播种的道理，古人也很了解。如农政全书引张五典种法说：“种不宜晚，晚则秋寒，早则桃多不成实，即成亦不甚大，而花软无绒”。群芳谱也说：“种不宜早，恐春霜伤苗，又不宜晚，恐秋霜伤桃”。究以何时播种为适呢？农政全书提出具体时间，说棉花播种期以“清明前五日为上时，后五日为中时，谷雨为下时，决不宜过谷雨矣”。清康熙年间蒲松龄所著农蚕经中说：“大约在清明谷雨间，酌其冷暖，略早种之，苗虽不肥，而节密桃多，晚则苗虽盛而桃稀”。此外在其他许多古书中，也都主张早播。目前我国各地棉花播种期一般偏迟，古人这一提早播种，充分利用无霜期的主张，对我们研究播种期问题有所启示。
    但早播多易造成烂种缺苗，徐光启分析其原因有四，即选种不精、撒播不盖土、播种太密和地力瘠薄等。同时也提出了防止早播缺苗的办法四项，即精选棉籽、增施肥料、稀植和播后盖土镇压等。另外，对于地蚕较多的地，应设法捕灭地蚕；翻绿肥的地，应翻盖均匀，以防绿肥发酵时烧种烂芽。在这几项技术中，除稀植一项有待研究外，其余各项都肯定是正确的，至今仍有其现实意义。
    古代用于棉花的播种方法也有点播、撒播和条播三种，一般多主张采用点播。群芳谱所载点播方法较详，它说：在地耕好后，于播种沟内，隔一尺作一穴，于穴中浇水一、二碗，待水渗入土后，下种四、五粒，以熟粪一碗盖种，再盖土一、二指厚，用脚踏实以代镇压。对于撒播和条播的，也必须以“木碌碡”碾平，或以“石砘”砘实。
    “随种下肥”能及时供给作物苗期养分，使苗期生长茁壮，并节约用肥，故在目前仍被视为先进农业技术之一。但在我国，这一方法也早已用于生产上了。如群芳谱和三农纪都主张在粪少时应“随种而用粪”，这种粪必须腐熟，以免烧种烂芽，并说若采用腐熟麻饼则甚好。
    耕心农话还主张在开穴后，以熟粪拌泥，垫底下种，下种后以“秧灰”盖之，然后轻轻按实，并以微水润之。此外，作于十九世纪末的抚郡农产考略中还载有在点播棉花时，以人尿浇灌之，“并以乌灰、黄土复种”，也有用火粪盖种的。火粪盖种办法至今仍流行在南方棉区。
    在棉田中耕除草方面，古人主张早锄、勤锄、细锄，要求在夏至前即锄草七遍，锄头三遍草时结合间苗定苗。如元代的资治通鉴胡三省注中就说：棉花“既种，须一月三薅”。农桑辑要说：棉田“锄治常要洁净”。农桑衣食撮要说：棉田须“勤锄”。农政全书又说：锄棉“功须极细密”，锄必七遍以上，又须在夏至前，谚云：锄花要趁黄梅信，锄头落地长三寸。
    头草早锄这一原则，至今仍为老农所重视。古书中也都主张在棉花两片子叶时即锄头草，张五典和王象晋都一致主张：第一次锄草间苗时宜密留棉苗，以备缺损，再锄仍宜稍密，三锄则定苗。植棉纂要对锄草结合间苗说得更加具体，它把头二次留苗的多少与天气结合起来，如天气还很冷即多留，暖则少留。
    锄棉还可结合追肥、培土，如张五典种法说：或锄到三遍，花苗高耸，每根苗边，用熟粪半升培植。植棉纂要说：“锄耘之法，宜近根二、三寸，将土松动，遗土即培护根下，则土松培厚，苗得行根深远，便耐旱、耐风雨”。
    各项技术措施结合进行，既能同时供应作物生活所需要的综合因素。又节省人工，现代机耕技术仍以中耕配合追肥、培土，这就显示了现代农业技术同古代农业技术之间的继承关系。
    十三世纪的农桑辑要一书中，即已有了关于棉花摘心整枝的记载，说棉花长到二尺高时，即应打去冲天心，旁枝长到尺半，也应去心，这样才能使棉株节不空地开花结实。至群芳谱，棉花摘心整枝在我国已经成了相当高级、复杂而细致的技术工作，该书中不仅提到摘心整枝时棉花主干及旁枝的长度，并订出密度同整枝配合的结果，应达到“勿令交枝相揉”的标准。又提出顶心或旁心应在“三伏天各打一次”，且应在晴天打去，以防雨水侵入伤口，致使棉枝溃烂。又由于棉枝生长速度不一，所以摘心整枝工作不应要求一次完成，而应当枝条长大时，“随时打去，不必例拘”。
    目前我国还有不少地区不进行棉花摘心整枝，有的虽行而很不细致，不是“随时打去，不必例拘”，而是贪图省事，一次完成，往往造成减产。这种现象，与其说是没有采用先进技术，倒不如说是我国古法已被遗忘失传。
    在选种方面，我国早就有选用“中喷花”（棉株中部的棉花）作种的习惯，如王祯农书中说：“所种之子，初收者未实，近霜者又不可用。唯中间时月收者为上。”此后各书都如此记载。至十九世纪末的王树善种棉法对此法又有进一步的说明，说：“摘花分三次，第一次摘后，逾半月，摘第二次，又半月，摘第三次，其第二次所摘花朵，宜拣出最佳者，以为种子”。这种选用“中喷花”办法还结合了铃选，也有记载结合株选或瓣选的。
    苏联多主张选用第一批收得的花作种，因此，解放之初，有人想据此否定我国选用“中喷花”的经验。但苏联自然情况同我国不同，苏联纬度较高，生长期较短，可能只有第一批花的种子成熟比较充分。我国留用“中喷花”作种的习惯既是自古流传，且已普及全国，想必有其一定道理，绝不容轻易加以否定。
    对于棉种粒选的重要性，古人也了解得相当深刻。在三百多年前，群芳谱即指出：棉籽的“陈者，秕者、油者、湿者、蒸者、经火焙者，皆不堪作种。将种时，用水浥湿，过半刻，淘出其不堪者，皆浮出水面，而坚实不损者必沉，取而使之，苗必茂”。
    徐光启在农政全书中，还把不进行粒选或粒选不精，列为棉花减产和早播缺苗的四大原因之一，又把粒选列为增产和防止早播缺苗的主要办法。至今粒选仍为一项重要植棉技术。
    此外，在浸种方面，古书中还载有用腊月雪水和鳗鱼汁浸种办法，说如此便能使棉花耐寒，耐旱，并耐风雨。在防止早播缺苗方面，徐光启在农政全书中提出于棉田中先种大麦或蚕豆，然后翻入土中种棉，棉苗即能耐寒，并说这样“可先他田半月十日种”。在间苗方面，古人都主张间去过大和过小的棉苗，留用中等棉苗，说大苗虽枝叶繁茂，而结桃较少。在轮作方面，主张在稻棉轮作地区，采用“种棉二年，翻稻一年”的短期轮作制，说这样能使“草根溃烂，土气肥厚，虫螟不生”。对于麦棉两熟地区，徐光启早已提出从改进麦、棉播种方法着手，来克服两熟增产矛盾，他主张采用小麦点播，棉花点播或撒播。所有这些增产技术，都是很值得我们重行研究确定的。
    总之，我国农学遗产的丰富，可从古代植棉技术中窥见一斑。目前在“向科学进军”和“整理祖国科学遗产”的号召下，研究我国农学遗产是我们农业科学工作者的光荣任务。在我国农学方面，解放前一味模仿欧美，崇拜西洋；解放后，部分农业工作者，唯以苏联为是，而忽视了我国农业生产的特点。苏联先进经验肯定是必须学习的，但也必须了解我国的实际情况。我们现在负有“承先启后”的大任，即承我国农学遗产之“先”，启社会主义农业建设之“后”，希全国农业科学工作者共勉之。
