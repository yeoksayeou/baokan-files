Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 11th: TASS reports that the Soviet Union's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Federal Republic of Germany, Smirnov, paid a visit to Federal Chancellor Adenauer on the 8th and presented him with a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin.

In his letter, Bulganin pointed out: More than a year ago, during the negotiations in Moscow between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, it was unanimously agreed that the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries would open a new stage in the relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, promote the development of mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries, and help resolve the outstanding post-war issues of concern to the Soviet Union, the Federal Republic of Germany, and other countries. However, the development of relations between the two countries after the establishment of diplomatic relations and the mutual establishment of embassies has not been satisfactory. Many opportunities for developing mutual understanding and cooperation have not been utilized. In the Federal Republic of Germany, some forces seeking to obstruct the improvement of relations between the two countries and wanting to push the Federal Republic onto the dangerous road of war adventures are intensifying their activities. In particular, the intensified build-up of the army can only complicate the diplomatic situation of the Federal Republic and deepen the distrust and suspicion of other countries, especially its neighbors.

Bulganin said, "These words are not spoken because our country fears the German army being rebuilt in the Federal Republic, but because concern for the fate of peace in Europe and a sense of responsibility compel us to do so."

Bulganin mentioned in his letter that normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany are of decisive significance for peace in Europe and the world. However, some forces are doing everything possible to obstruct the development of normal relations between the two countries. In pursuit of narrow, selfish interests, these forces are constantly instigating and inciting the Federal Republic to be hostile to the Soviet Union and to engage in military conflict with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. They are also demanding that the Federal Republic intensify the build-up of a large army, increase military spending and the cost of supporting foreign troops, and plan for foreign troops to remain on the territory of the Federal Republic for decades, and even openly prepare to use West German territory as a base for atomic war. All these actions are pushing the Federal Republic towards aggression, towards a destructive path that is completely incompatible with the peace and security of Europe and the true national interests of the German people. These people are clearly planning to avoid atomic retaliation themselves, using the Federal Republic as a scapegoat, pulling chestnuts out of the fire with other people's hands, and taking advantage of geographical conditions to sit safely in remote corners of the earth and remain at large. But they have forgotten that in this century of technological development, there are no corners that weapons cannot reach.

Bulganin expressed the hope that national patriotic forces that will not allow their country to be dragged into military adventures will prevail in the Federal Republic of Germany. He also pointed out that the German people are not interested in returning to a path of hostility towards the Soviet Union.

Bulganin reiterated the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy and called on the Federal Republic of Germany to strengthen trust and establish friendly cooperative relations with the Soviet Union. He pointed out that this would undoubtedly help solve the main national problem of the German people, namely, German unification.

The only way to solve the German problem is through rapprochement between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Soviet government is ready to assist the two German governments in resolving the issue of a unified Germany at any time.

Bulganin also called on the Federal Republic of Germany to pay attention to the measures related to Germany in the Soviet government's disarmament proposals of November 17, 1956.

Bulganin said that the time is ripe for both sides to take some concrete measures that can greatly improve relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, fully based on the common resolutions made during the Moscow talks in 1955, such as increasing trade between the two countries and signing a trade treaty; signing an agreement on cultural and scientific-technical cooperation; and signing a consular agreement that defines the scope of both sides' authority to protect the interests of their citizens and helps resolve issues related to the repatriation of citizens.

Bulganin pointed out, "Of course, we do not think it is correct to limit our relations to economic, cultural, and scientific-technical cooperation. We believe that the views of the German people are of great significance when discussing major international issues. We have already discussed some of the most important issues, such as disarmament, guaranteeing European security, and other issues, with the government of the German Democratic Republic and have reached understanding. We believe that it would be very beneficial if the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany could come closer in their views on these issues."

    布尔加宁主席写信给阿登纳总理
    建议采取措施改善两国关系
    表示苏联随时准备协助两个德国政府解决德国统一问题
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：苏联驻德意志联邦共和国特命全权大使斯米尔诺夫8日拜会了联邦总理阿登纳，并且向他递交了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给他的一封信。
    布尔加宁在信中指出：苏联同德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团在一年多以前在莫斯科举行谈判时曾一致认为，两国正常外交关系的建立将揭开苏联同德意志联邦共和国间的关系的新阶段，促进两国间相互了解与合作的发展，有助于解决苏联、德意志联邦共和国和其他国家都关心的战后悬而未决的问题。但是，两国在建立外交关系和互设使馆之后关系的发展并不能令人感到满意。许多有利于发展相互谅解和合作的可能性没有加以利用。在德意志联邦共和国，一些希图阻挠改善两国之间的关系、想把联邦共和国推向战争冒险的危险道路的势力正在加紧活动。特别是加紧建立军队这件事只能使联邦共和国的外交局面复杂化，只能加深其他国家，特别是邻国对它的不信任和猜疑。
    布尔加宁说：“说这些话并不是因为我国害怕联邦共和国重建中的德国军队，而是因为对欧洲和平命运的关怀和责任感推动我们这样做。”
    布尔加宁在信中提到，苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间的正常关系对欧洲和平和世界和平有决定性意义。但是有些势力正在千方百计地阻挠两国间正常关系的发展。这些势力为了追求狭隘的自私利益，不断怂恿和唆使联邦共和国敌视苏联，同苏联和其他社会主义国家发生军事冲突。它们还要求德意志联邦共和国加紧建立庞大的军队、增加军费和供养外国军队的开支，预定外国军队在联邦共和国领土留驻数十年，甚至公开准备利用西德领土作为原子战争基地。这种种作法正在把德意志联邦共和国推向侵略，推向完全不符合欧洲和平和安全以及德国人民的真正民族利益的毁灭道路。这些人显然是打算使自己避开原子反击，而把德意志联邦共和国拿来顶罪，借别人的手从火中取栗，利用地理条件稳坐在地球的遥远的角落里逍遥法外。可是他们忘记了，在目前这个技术发展的世纪里已经没有武器达不到的角落了。
    布尔加宁表示希望：不允许自己国家被拖入军事冒险的民族爱国力量在德意志联邦共和国内将会占上风。他还指出，德国人民对重新走上敌视苏联的道路并不感兴趣。
    布尔加宁重申苏联的和平外交政策，并且要求德意志联邦共和国同苏联加强信任和建立友好合作关系。他指出，这毫无疑问会有助于德国人民的主要民族问题的解决，即有助于德国统一。
    只有通过德意志民主共和国同德意志联邦共和国之间的接近才能找到解决德国问题的方法。苏联政府方面随时准备协助两个德国政府解决统一德国的问题。
    布尔加宁还要求德意志联邦共和国注意1956年11月17日苏联政府裁军建议中有关德国的措施。
    布尔加宁说，现在时机已经成熟了，双方应当完全根据1955年莫斯科会谈期间所作出的共同决议，采取一些能大大改善苏联和德意志联邦共和国关系的具体措施，譬如增加两国之间的贸易和签订贸易条约；签订文化和科学技术合作协定以及签订确定双方保障本国公民利益的权限、并有助于解决有关遣返公民的问题的领事协议。
    布尔加宁指出：“我们当然并不认为把我们的关系局限在经济、文化和科学技术合作问题方面是正确的。我们认为在讨论国际主要问题的时候，德国人民的意见具有重大意义。我们同德意志民主共和国政府已经就一些最重大的问题，如裁军问题、保障欧洲安全和其他问题进行了讨论，并且取得了谅解。我们认为，苏联和德意志联邦共和国如果对这些问题的观点接近起来是极有好处的。”
