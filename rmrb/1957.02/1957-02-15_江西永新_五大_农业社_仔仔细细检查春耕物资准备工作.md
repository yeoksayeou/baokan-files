Jiangxi Yongxin "Five Greats" Agricultural Cooperative
Carefully Checks Spring Plowing Material Preparations

(Our Report) The "Five Greats" Agricultural Cooperative in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, has conducted a thorough check of the preparations for spring plowing and production materials, and discovered many existing problems.

The cooperative has sixty-nine head of cattle, all of which are raised by the members. Only twenty-three of them are well-raised, achieving proper stabling and feeding. Thirty-nine are averagely raised, and seven are in very poor condition.

Most of the seeds are kept by the cooperative members themselves, including 20,900 jin of rice seeds, 4,089 jin of sweet potato seedlings, and 1,290 jin of peanut seeds. Of the rice seeds, three households have placed them on the ground, and they are now damp. Eleven households have not stored them properly, and sparrows and mice have eaten a lot of them. One household even mixed the seed grain with the grain for consumption, causing confusion.

The cooperative has sixty-six plows, fifty harrows, twenty-six rice threshing tubs, twenty-six rice measuring dippers, and fourteen waterwheels. These have all been assigned to the production teams or individual households for safekeeping. Except for two production teams and some cooperative members who have kept them in good condition, washing the farm tools and storing them upstairs, others have left the farm tools outside, exposed to the wind and rain without anyone taking care of them.

Of the 140 mu of rapeseed and 163 mu of safflower planted by the cooperative, only the rapeseed has been universally fertilized once, and most of them have not had ditches dug for drainage.

    江西永新“五大”农业社
    仔仔细细检查春耕物资准备工作
    本报讯　江西永新县“五大”农业社，深入检查春耕生产物资准备工作，发现存在着许多问题。
    全社有六十九头牛，都由社员分养，其中只有二十三头养得较好，做到了栏干食饱，养得一般的三十九头，最差的七头。
    种籽大部分是由社员保管。包括二万零九百斤谷种，四千零八十九斤番薯种，一千二百九十斤花生种。谷种，有三户把它放在地上，现在湿了；十一户没有装好，被麻雀、老鼠偷吃了不少；一户还把种谷放在吃谷一起，搞混了。
    社里有六十六张犁、五十张耙，二十六只禾桶、二十六只禾斗、水车十四乘。这些都划归各生产组保管或由户保管。除有两个生产组和部分社员保管较好，把农具洗净放到楼上，其他有的把农具丢在外面，风吹雨打无人保管。
    全社种的一百四十亩油菜和一百六十三亩红花草，只油菜普遍追了一次肥，而大部分没有开沟排水。
