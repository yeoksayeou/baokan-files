Turning Waste Smoke and Gas into Wealth
    Fan Qing

    In the skies above the Dalian Chemical Plant, wisps of white and yellow smoke float all day long; in the sea next to the chemical plant, various smelly liquids often flow, or truckloads of furnace ash are dumped for land reclamation. In the past, these things were all regarded as waste, but now they have become useful things, turned into the wealth of the country.

    Using Water from Ditches to Make Fertilizer
    The coke oven gas produced in the First Workshop contains trace amounts of ammonia gas and ammonia water. Because the content was very small, the workshop workers did not pay attention to it, and coupled with the lack of equipment, it was allowed to flow into the sea along the ditches in the past. Last year, the workshop workers began to pay attention to the recovery of these ammonia gas and ammonia water, and the factory design department also assisted the workshop in building a small saturation tank and separator to turn the recovered ammonia gas and ammonia water into fertilizer. In January of this year, this workshop used the recovered ammonia gas and ammonia water to produce 193 tons of fertilizer.

    Furnace Ash Used for Land Reclamation Can Be Used to Make Iron
    From the Seventh Workshop of this factory, trains often pull out, loaded with red ash soil and dumped into the sea. This red ash soil is the furnace ash left over from the manufacture of sulfuric acid from iron sulfide ore in this workshop. The factory had previously tested the furnace ash and found that it still contained more than 70% iron oxide. After research, they believed that one ton of such furnace ash could be used to produce more than half a ton of good iron; if it were used to replace shale in the manufacture of cement, the quality of the cement could also be fully guaranteed. However, there was no market at that time, so it could not be utilized. Now the factory is manufacturing equipment for recovering furnace ash, and is preparing to recover all the furnace ash produced by the workshop from April, and supply it to brother factories for manufacturing cement and iron, which is expected to increase income by more than 400,000 yuan a year.

    Using Toxic Gases to Make Sulfur
    The water gas used to manufacture synthetic ammonia in this factory contains trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which can not only poison and kill workers, but also be detrimental to production. Therefore, workshop workers used to combine it with iron powder to form iron sulfide and then throw it away, but Soviet experts turned the toxic gas into something useful. Soviet experts helped the factory install some equipment to recover and utilize this gas, which can produce more than 140 tons of sulfur annually, worth more than 80,000 yuan. This sulfur can be used to manufacture insecticides and matches.

    White Smoke Turned into Fertilizer
    People near this factory often see wisps of white smoke coming out of the factory all day long. This smoke is the residual sulfuric acid tail gas left over from the manufacture of contact sulfuric acid. This gas not only harms the health of workers, corrodes equipment, but also discolors clothing. However, last year, they used these recovered sulfuric acid smoke and ammonia gas to synthesize 2,006 tons of ammonium sulfate mother liquor, and used these mother liquor to produce 1,076 tons of fertilizer.

    把废烟废气变成财富
    凡青
    在大连化学厂的上空，整天漂浮着缕缕的白烟和黄烟；在化学厂旁边的海中，也经常流入各种有味的液体，或倒入成车的填海用的炉灰。这些东西在过去都是被当作废物的，但现在它们都成了有用之物，变成了国家的财富。
    用水沟里的水做肥田粉
    第一车间生产的焦炉气中含有微量的氨气和氨水，因为含量很少，车间职工没有把它看在眼里，再加上缺少设备，所以过去一直让它顺着水沟淌到大海里去。去年，车间职工开始重视这些氨气和氨水的回收，工厂设计部门也协助车间修建了一个小型的饱和槽和分离机，把回收起来的氨气和氨水制成肥田粉。今年1月份这个车间利用回收的氨气和氨水制成了一百九十三吨肥田粉。
    填海的炉灰能炼铁
    从这个工厂的第七车间经常开出一列列的小火车，把满载着红色的灰土倒入大海中去。这些红色的灰土是这个车间用硫化铁矿制造硫酸后剩下来的炉灰。这个工厂以前就对炉灰作过化验，发现里面还含有70％以上的氧化铁。经过研究，他们认为一吨这样的炉灰，就可以炼出半吨多的好铁；如果用它代替页岩制造水泥，也完全可以保证水泥的质量。但那时没有销路，所以未能加以利用。现在这个工厂正在制造回收炉灰的设备，准备从4月份开始把车间出产的炉灰全部回收，供应兄弟工厂制造水泥和炼铁，预计一年可以增加四十多万元的收入。
    用有毒的气体做硫磺
    这个工厂制造合成氨用的水煤气中，含有微量的硫化氢气，这种气体不仅能使工人中毒、死亡，而且还对生产不利。因此车间工人过去总是把它和铁粉化合成硫化铁，然后扔掉，可是苏联专家却使毒气变成有用之物。苏联专家帮助这个工厂安装了一些设备，把这种气体回收利用，每年可以制成一百四十多吨硫磺，价值八万多元，这种硫磺可以制造杀虫剂和火柴。
    白烟变成肥料
    在这个工厂附近的人，常常会看到这个工厂整天冒出缕缕的白烟。这种烟就是在制造接触硫酸过程中剩余下来的硫酸尾气。这种气体不仅能损害工人的健康，能腐蚀设备，还能使衣服脱色。可是，去年他们就用这些回收起来的硫酸烟和氨气化合成二千零六吨硫铵母液，利用这些母液制成了一千零七十六吨肥田粉。（原载旅大日报）
