    Persuading Her Husband
    Gao Shen
    January 7th. The northwest wind was whistling, and the pedestrians on the street were sparse. I walked for more than half an hour, asking several people before I finally found No. 13 Guangming Street – the home of Zhao Yingqi, a young lathe operator at the Shenyang Third Machine Tool Factory.
    It was a small, low-rise house, facing south, with plenty of sunshine. The room wasn't big, but it was very clean. In the center of the room was a brand-new sewing machine, and on the wall hung photos and some art paintings. There were no adults in the house, only a chubby baby sleeping soundly on the kang, probably the "eldest daughter" that Zhao Yingqi often boasted about to others as being clever and well-behaved.
    Before long, a woman of about twenty-four or five years old and a child came in, carrying a bucket of water. After she poured the water into the vat, she looked me over. Before I could introduce myself, she had already guessed who I was. It turned out that Zhao Yingqi had already told his wife, Luo Min, about the visit today.
    "I heard that Zhao Yingqi is doing well?" I asked.
    "Yes, much better than before," she said slowly and deliberately.
    "That's due to your help, right?"
    "He's improved himself; what do I have to do with it!" She smiled shyly.
    "The comrades in the factory all say so!"
    "They're welcome to say so!" She flicked her hair back and said, "Actually, what can a housewife like me understand!"
    We were silent for a few minutes, and the room seemed particularly quiet, so quiet that it was embarrassing, only the horseshoe clock was ticking clearly, "tick-tock." So, I found a topic.
    "I heard that you even argued about buying this clock. What was that about?"
    Seeing that I was talking about her family affairs again, Luo Min was much more natural than before. She answered calmly and methodically.
    "That was in the autumn of 1955. We had been married for less than a year at that time. He could only earn sixteen or seventeen yuan every half month, and life was very tight. Even with frugality, we never had enough money each month… Once, after he got his salary, I suggested buying a clock, but he flatly refused."
    "What made you think of buying a clock?" I asked.
    "Wasn't it because he loved to sleep in in the morning? If you called him, he would shout at you, 'What's the rush? It's still early for work!' But I secretly asked the neighbors, and they all said he was always late. When I asked him, he lied and said, 'I'm rarely late.' Otherwise, he would use the excuse of not having a clock. I thought that if we had a clock, it would be better to urge him to go to work on time. Who knew he would flatly refuse to buy one."
    "So, what happened later?"
    "Later, I thought about it, and what he said made sense. He only earned that little money every half month. If we bought a clock, how would we live? So, I decided to save bit by bit." She took a breath and said, "From then on, even if there was no vegetables at home, I would say that I bought two pounds of potatoes, or a few pieces of tofu. In this way, saving a dime, two dimes, or a few cents every day, I saved ten or so yuan in six or seven months. Just in time for his salary, I added two more yuan and bought this old clock on the street… When Yingqi came home and saw a clock on the table, he was startled and shouted at me: 'Look at you, you finally bought this thing. I don't see how we're going to live for the next half month!' When I saw that he was really anxious, I quickly told him the truth. When he heard it, he was happy, put the clock to his ear to listen, looked at it under the light, and kept saying, 'Great! Great!'"
    "Did he still arrive late after having this clock?"
    "No, he hasn't been late since then."
    "Never been late again?" I was a little skeptical, because before 1954, Zhao Yingqi was a young worker who was dedicated to dancing, didn't care about production, and often violated labor discipline. At that time, he spent almost a third of his nights in the dance hall, accompanied by all-night dance music. Often, when the sun was about to rise, others, urged by the sound of the siren, marched toward the factory with vigor, facing the rising sun; however, Zhao Yingqi lazily dragged his heavy steps, lowered his head to look at his instep, and stepped into the house, or was standing in front of the machine, dozing off. Being late for work, leaving early, and even absenteeism had become a habit for Zhao Yingqi at that time.
    The leaders of the workshop didn't know how many times they had educated Zhao Yingqi without any effect. Could a horseshoe clock change his habit of being late? But Luo Min's few words dispelled the doubts in my mind. She said: "At first, he didn't pay attention to my intention of buying the clock. The neighbors all said to him, 'Zhao Yingqi, if you are late again, you will be sorry for your wife. She saved money by economizing to buy this clock. What for? Isn't it just to have a time, so that you can go to work without being late!' Everyone said that to him, even if he had a heart of stone, it would crack! One day he said to me, 'Luo Min, you watch, I guarantee that I will never be late again from today onwards.' That's right, the next morning, he got up before I even called him. I'm not afraid of you laughing at me, this was the first time he had gotten up early in the year or so that we had been married! Who knew that it wouldn't work after a few days, he would have to look at the clock ten or eight times every time he got out of bed, and he wouldn't get up a little earlier, and he would have to dawdle until he would be late if he didn't get up. Seeing him like this, I thought of a way to deceive him, and every day I set the clock forward by thirty minutes, so that when he got up according to the time, he would still have thirty minutes left to get to the factory. Over time, when he found out about this, he also developed the habit of getting up early."
    Talking about her help to Zhao Yingqi, Luo Min continued: "I used to sometimes tell him some of the principles I had learned, but he didn't listen. If I said something to make him strive to be an advanced producer, he always had eighteen sentences waiting for me. But once I knitted him a vest and said a few words to him, his eyes turned red. The next day, he said to me: 'Luo Min, you watch, from today onwards you will definitely have a husband who is an advanced producer.'"
    I asked: "What was the reason for this?"
    "That's how it happened. In June of the year before last, I saw that he was very hot, so I knitted him a vest. The vests people buy all have words on them, and I also wanted to crochet a few words on it. But what words should I crochet? I thought about it for several days and decided to crochet the two words 'Youth'. That day, when he came back from work, I took the vest to him to see without waiting for him to eat. He didn't even look at it, took it and put it on, tried it on and it fit perfectly, and said happily: 'Great! Great!' I said: 'Don't dislike the words that are crocheted badly.' He lowered his head and looked carefully at the words on the vest: 'Hey! Why did you bother to crochet these two words?' I said: 'I originally wanted to crochet the two words 'Advanced' as well, but unfortunately the person wearing it is not yet an advanced youth.' I thought he would definitely say as before, half-jokingly, 'Isn't it possible to earn more than 30 yuan even if I'm not an advanced producer!' Who knew that he lost his temper, took off the vest, threw it hard on the kang, and said: 'Tell you, in the future, stop blocking me with thorny words!' As a result, he lay down without even eating dinner that day."
    "I felt very uncomfortable about this, and I was angry with him and felt sorry for him. I was angry that he didn't know what was good for him, and when people hoped that he would take the right path, he would get angry with them; I felt sorry for him because he had worked all day and came home and had an unpleasant argument, and hadn't eaten. What if he got sick suddenly? I caused it, so I have to persuade him!"
    "That night, I told him all my thoughts. I said: 'I married you with great hope. I don't hope that you will earn more money, I hope that you can work hard and that people will say good things about us behind our backs. But you are disappointing. Whoever mentions you says that you don't work hard, love to dance, and don't complete your tasks. I am really ashamed when I hear these words. Think about it, if others say in front of you that I can't live a good life, wasting rice and flour, wouldn't you be anxious? But no matter what others say about you, I am always the same to you. I always think that you won't always be like this. When I was alone before, no one loved you and no one cared about you, so you inevitably acted willfully; now you have a family, and you are older, and you will slowly get better…. We earn less money and don't have enough to spend, I never mention these things to you, and sometimes the tighter our life is, the happier I am in front of you, for fear that you will worry about the family and not be able to work properly. I have difficulties myself crying in the dark, and don't mention a word to you. In order for you to have enough to eat for work, no matter how little money there is at home, I will try to get you some good food. But I, except for Sundays, don't eat a dish all year round. Why can others exceed the quota on piecework, but we can't complete the task? We are all the same people, why don't we make an effort and show a good example!…’ I said and said, for a full two hours, and his eyes turned red, and a few tears fell. It seemed that he was really sad that day. But he didn't say anything, just held my hand tightly…."
    "The next day, he came back as soon as he got off work, and rushed to me and said: 'Luo Min, you watch, from today onwards, you will definitely have a husband who is an advanced producer!' He smiled after he finished speaking, and I couldn't say whether I was happy or sad, very happy but also wanting to cry. He looked at me and said: 'Luo Min, I'm telling the truth. Today, our party branch secretary had a talk with me… He didn't tell me any big principles, but I felt that every sentence was right.'"
    "So, did Zhao Yingqi become an advanced producer?"
    "He did. He became an advanced producer in the workshop in April last year. I heard that he has also been named an advanced producer in the entire factory this time!" As she said this, Luo Min became a little shy again.
    It was getting late, the sun was setting, and the small room was gradually getting chilly. I casually asked: "It must be cold in this room at night, right?"
    "A little cold. But not too cold."
    "Why don't you get a foreign stove?"
    "I wanted to, but it didn't pass."
    "Who didn't pass it?"
    "Yingqi didn't agree, and I didn't agree either. I didn't agree in order to save money, and he didn't agree because he said it was to save coal for the country."
    "Good! You've thought it through pretty thoroughly!" Speaking of this, I suddenly remembered something else, "How is life now?"
    "Much better." Luo Min's eyes were shining, "His work is better, and his salary is higher. Look, we bought a new sewing machine at home, and he rides a bicycle; besides these, there are also cotton clothes, quilts… all new inside and out." Luo Min became more and more happy, and her somewhat pale face also became rosy with happiness.
    On the way back, I kept thinking: Everyone is making contributions to socialist construction, including those housewives who engage in housework day and night.

    劝夫 
    高深
    1月7日。西北风嗖嗖地刮着，街上的行人稀稀落落。我走了半个多小时，打听了几个人才找到了光明街十三号——沈阳第三机床厂青年车工赵英岐的家。
    这是一间矮小的平房，座北朝南，阳光充足，屋子不大，倒很清洁。房中央放着一台崭新的缝纫机，墙上挂着照片和一些美术画。屋里没有大人，只是炕上熟睡着一个白胖胖的娃娃，大概那就是赵英岐常向人夸耀的那个又灵又乖的“大女儿”。
    不多时，一个年约二十四、五岁的妇女和一个小孩抬着一桶水进来了。她把水倒在缸里以后，朝我打量着，还没等我给她介绍，她倒先猜透了。原来昨天赵英岐已经把今天有人来访的事儿向他的爱人罗敏讲了。
    “听说赵英岐干的不坏？”我问。
    “是。比过去好多了。”她慢条斯理地说。
    “这是由于你的帮助吧？”
    “人家自己进步了，有我啥！”她腼腆地笑了。
    “厂里的同志都这么说呀！”
    “他们愿意那么说呗！”她把头发往后撩了一撩说：“其实咱一个家庭妇女能懂个啥呀！”
    我们沉默了几分钟，屋子显得特别静，静得使人发窘，只有那块马蹄表在清晰地、“答——答”地响着。于是使我找到了话题。
    “听说因为买这块表你们还吵过架，那是因为啥呀？”
    罗敏见我又谈起家常事来，比刚才自然得多了，她回答得不慌不忙，很有条理。
    “那是1955年秋天的事。那时候我们结婚还不到一年。他每半月只能发十六七块钱，日子过得挺紧，就是省吃俭用，每个月也总是不够花……有一次发了薪金，我提出买块表，他死活不同意。”
    “你怎么想起买表来呢？”我问。
    “还不是因为他早晨爱睡懒觉，你要招唤他就跟你喊，‘忙什么？离上班还早着呢！’可是我偷着向邻居打听，人家都说他每天迟到。我问他，他还瞒我说‘很少迟到’。再不，就拿没有钟表做借口。我寻思要是有个表，到时催着他上班不是好一些吗。谁知道他就是死活不同意买。”
    “那么后来怎样了呢？”
    “后来我一想他说的也有道理，半个月才发那么点钱，要是买了表，日子还过不过呀！这样我就下决心零攒。”她喘了口气说“从那以后，明明家里没有买菜，我也说买了二斤土豆，或是买了几块豆腐。这么每天一角、两角或者几分，攒了六、七个月就攒了十来元，正好又赶上发薪金，我就又凑了两元，到街上买了这块旧表……英岐回家一看桌子上添了块表，把他吓了一跳，冲着我说：‘看你，到底买了这玩艺儿，我看这半个月的生活怎么过！’我一看他真急了，赶快把实话告诉他，他一听乐了，把表放到耳朵底下听，拿到灯下看，一劲说：‘太好啦！太好啦！’”
    “有了这表以后他还迟到不？”
    “不了，从那以后再也没迟过到。”
    “再也没有迟到过？”我心里有些怀疑，因为在1954年以前赵英岐还是一个专心跳舞、不爱生产、常常违反劳动纪律的青年工人。那时候，差不多有三分之一的夜晚，他是伴着通宵的舞曲在舞场里度过的，往往当太阳快要升起来的时候，别人随着汽笛声的催促，朝气勃勃地迎着初升的太阳，阔步走向工厂；然而赵英岐却懒洋洋地拖着沉重的步子，低头看着脚背迈进了家门，或是正站在机器前打着瞌睡。上班迟到、早退甚至旷工，在当时的赵英岐已经成了习惯。
    车间的领导人不知道对赵英岐进行了多少次的教育都没有效，一台马蹄表能改变他迟到的习惯吗？可是罗敏几句话就打消了我心里的怀疑。她说：“起初他倒没理会我买表的意思，人家邻居们都跟他说，‘赵英岐呀，你要是再迟到可对不起你媳妇了，她省吃俭用攒下钱买了这块表，为了什么？不就是为了有个钟点，你上班好不迟到吗！’人家都这么说他，他就是石头心肠，还不开开缝呀！有一天他跟我说‘罗敏，你瞧着吧，从今天起保证再也不迟到了。’真不错，第二天早上，人家没等我招唤就起来了。不怕您笑话，这还是我和他结婚一年多来他头一次起得早呢！哪知道过了几天又不行了，起一回床也得看十次八次表，早一点也不起来，非磨到再不起就迟到了才起来。我看他这样，就想了个办法骗他，每天都把表往快拨三十分钟，这样他靠到点起来到厂子还余三十分钟。时间长了，等他知道了这事，也养成了早起的习惯了。”
    谈到她对赵英岐的帮助，罗敏接着说：“从前我也有时和他讲些学来的道理，可是他不听。我要是一说让他争取做个先进生产者啥的，他总是有十八句话等着我。可是我有一次给他织了一件背心，说了他几句，他眼圈都红了。第二天就对我说：‘罗敏，你瞧着吧，从今天起你一定能有一个先进生产者的丈夫’。”
    我问：“这究竟又是因为什么呢？”
    “是这么回事儿。前年6月，我看他挺热的，就给他织了个背心。人家买的背心上面都有字，我也想抅几个字在上面。可是抅啥字呢？我琢磨好几天决定抅‘青年’这两个字。那天他下班回来，我没等他吃饭就把背心拿给他看。他倒连看也没看，接过去就套在身上了，试一试挺合身，美滋滋地说：‘太好啦！太好啦！’我说：‘你别嫌字抅的不好看就行。’他低下头仔细看了看背心上的字：‘唉！你干啥费这大劲抅两个字呢！’我说：‘我本来还想再抅上“先进”两个字哪，可惜穿它的人还不是先进青年。’我本想他一定还会像以前一样，半开玩笑地说‘我不是先进生产者不也挣三十多元吗！’哪想到他发了脾气，把背心脱下来，使劲往炕上一摔，说：‘告诉你，今后少拿疙瘩话堵我！’结果那天他连晚饭都没有吃就躺下了”。
    “这一闹我也怪不好受的，心里又气他又疼他，气他不知道好歹，人家希望他走好道他还跟人家来火了；疼他白天干了一天活，回家来又闹了个不痛快，还没吃饭，要是急病了……怎么办呢？我惹的还得我劝说呀！”
    “那天晚上我把心里话都跟他说了。我说：‘我跟你结婚抱着很大希望，我倒不是希望你多挣些钱，我希望你能够好好工作，让人家背后都说咱个好。可是你不争气，人家谁提起你来都说你不好好工作，爱跳舞，完不成任务。听了这些话我真脸红。你想，如果别人当你面前说我不会过日子，泼米撒面，你能不着急吗？可是不管别人怎么说你，我从来是对你一个样，我总寻思你不会老这样。从前自己一个人的时候没人疼你也没人管你，免不了任性；现在有家了，岁数也大了，慢慢会好的……。咱们挣钱少不够花，我从来不跟你提这些，有时咱们生活越紧，我在你面前越特别高兴，怕你挂着家，干活不称心。有困难我自己背地里掉眼泪，也不向你提一字儿。为你上班干活能吃饱，家里怎么没钱也想法给你弄点好菜。可是我在家，除了星期天，成年也不吃一顿菜。为什么别人计件都能超额，偏偏咱们就完不成任务呢？都是一样的人，咱不兴卖卖力气干出个样来！……’我说呀，说呀，足足说了两个钟点，说得他眼圈红了，掉下几颗泪珠。看样子那天他真难过了。可是他什么也没说，只是紧紧地握着我的手……。”
    “第二天一下班他就回来了，进门就冲我说：‘罗敏，你瞧着吧，从今天起，你一定会能有一个先进生产者的丈夫！’他说完笑了，我心里说不出是高兴还是难过，挺快乐却又要掉眼泪。他看着我说：‘罗敏，我说的是真话。今天俺们党支部书记给我谈了一次话……他没跟我讲大道理，可是我觉着句句都是理。’”
    “那么，赵英岐到底当上先进生产者没有？”
    “当上了。去年4月就当上了车间的先进生产者。听说这回又评上全厂的先进生产者啦！”说着，罗敏又有点腼腆起来。
    时间已经不早了，夕阳西下，这时小屋渐渐有些寒意，我随便地问了一句：“这屋里晚上要冷吧？”
    “冷点。可也不算太冷。”
    “为什么不生个洋炉子呢？”
    “想生，可是没有通过。”
    “谁没通过？”
    “英岐不同意，我也不同意。我不同意是为了省钱，人家不同意说是为了给国家节约用煤。”
    “好呀！你们想的还挺全面哩！”说到这里，我忽然又想起了一件事，“现在生活怎么样？”
    “好多了。”罗敏的眼里闪着光，“他工作好了，工资也多了，你看，家里买上了新缝纫机，他骑上了自行车；除了这些还有棉衣、被子……都是里面三新。”罗敏越说越高兴，她那多少有些苍白的脸，也高兴得红润起来。
    在归来的路上，我不住地思念着：在社会主义建设中，人人都作出贡献，其中也有那些朝夕从事家务劳动的家庭妇女的贡献。
