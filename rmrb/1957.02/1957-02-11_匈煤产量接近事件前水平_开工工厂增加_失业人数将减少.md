Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 10th: Hungarian coal miners increased coal production to 60,204 tons on February 7th. This is the highest daily output since the October incident last year, reaching 90% of the average daily output before the incident. According to newspaper reports, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government authorities originally estimated that due to the decline in coal production and insufficient factory openings, 200,000 to 250,000 people might be unemployed in the first quarter of this year. Now, due to the rapid and steadily increasing coal production (originally estimated at 35,000 to 40,000 tons per day in the first quarter), and the increase in the number of factories reopening compared to the original estimates, the number of unemployed people nationwide will decrease. At the same time, the coal supply to residents in various regions has also improved.

    匈煤产量接近事件前水平
    开工工厂增加  失业人数将减少
    新华社布达佩斯10日电　匈牙利的煤矿工人在2月7日这一天把煤产量提高到六万零二百零四吨。这是去年十月事件以来的最高日产量，达到了事件前平均日产量的90％。据报纸消息，匈牙利工农革命政府当局原估计，由于煤的生产下降和工厂开工不足，今年第一季度中可能有二十到二十五万人失业。现在，由于煤产量迅速和节节上升（原先估计，第一季度每天可以生产三万五千到四万吨煤），开工的工厂也比原先估计增加，因此，全国失业人数将会减少。同时，对各地居民的用煤供应也有改善。
