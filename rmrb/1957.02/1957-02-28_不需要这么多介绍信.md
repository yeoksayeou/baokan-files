    Fewer Letters of Introduction Needed
    Comrade Editor:
    When I was transferred from Shanxi to work in Shaanxi, I carried with me many kinds of letters of introduction: Party membership introduction, administrative introduction, salary and benefits introduction, Party internal publication reading introduction, theoretical study introduction, household registration transfer certificate, military service introduction, public medical care introduction, and cooking oil introduction. Obtaining these letters of introduction involved going through ten units: the county party committee organization department, secretary's office, propaganda department, county people's committee personnel section, military service bureau, public security bureau, grain bureau, finance section, oil and fat company, administrative office, and health section. The procedures were very complicated. For example, to obtain a cooking oil certificate, one must first ask the personnel department to write a letter to the administrative office, which then writes a letter of introduction to the oil and fat company before one can receive the official cooking oil introduction letter. When receiving the salary and benefits introduction letter, one must take the personnel department's introduction letter to the finance section to exchange for a certificate, and then go to the administrative office to collect travel expenses. Changing the household registration transfer certificate is even more troublesome. First, one must obtain an administrative introduction letter to go to Cheng Guan Township to exchange for an introduction letter, and then take the introduction letter to the Public Security Bureau to process the official household registration certificate.
    Some of these procedures are indispensable. However, some can be considered for simplification. For example, writing the month to which the salary is paid on the administrative level introduction letter can eliminate the need for a salary introduction letter. Having a household registration transfer and administrative introduction letter can also eliminate the need for grain and cooking oil introduction letters. With an administrative level and position and Party organizational relationship introduction letter, the new unit can issue Party internal publications according to the political treatment that should be enjoyed, without the need to issue a separate Party internal publication introduction letter. Cadre files often contain theoretical study results, which can also replace the theoretical study introduction letter. If cadres are assigned to work in administrative departments, they can enjoy public medical care, which is a unified national regulation, and a public medical care introduction letter is unnecessary. In order to process the introduction letter procedures, I traveled to fifteen places and spent a full two days, which was indeed a lot of waste. I hope the leading authorities can pay attention to streamlining these procedures to give cadres who are being transferred more convenience.

### 不需要这么多介绍信

    不需要这么多介绍信
    编辑同志：
    我由山西调往陕西工作，走时随身带着好多种介绍信：党的关系介绍、行政介绍、工资待遇介绍、阅读党内刊物介绍、理论学习介绍、户口迁移证、兵役介绍、公费医疗介绍、食油介绍。换取这些介绍信通过了县委组织部、秘书室、宣传部、县人民委员会人事科、兵役局、公安局、粮食局、财政科、油脂公司、事务处、卫生科等十个单位。往返手续非常复杂。如办食油证先得找人事部门写信转给事务处，由事务处再写介绍信到油脂公司，才能领取正式食油介绍信。领取工资待遇介绍信时，又必须拿人事机关介绍信到财政科换取证件，再到事务处去领车费。换户口迁移证时更麻烦，先领取行政介绍信去城关乡换取介绍信，再拿介绍信到公安局办理正式户口证。
    这些手续有些是不可少的。可是有些却可以考虑省去。如行政级别介绍信中写上工资发至月份就可免去工资介绍信。有了户口迁移及行政介绍信也可以免去粮食、食油介绍信。有了行政级别职务及党的组织关系介绍信，到新单位即可按应享的政治待遇发给党内刊物，不必发党内刊物介绍信。干部档案中经常存有学习理论成绩，也可以代替理论学习介绍信。干部分配如调到行政部门工作都可享受公费医疗，这是全国统一规定，公费医疗介绍信是不必要的。我为了办理介绍信手续往返走了十五处地方，费了整整两天时间，其中确有不少浪费，希望领导机关能够注意精简一下这些手续，给调动工作的干部更多的方便。　陕西三原县民政科　张政
