    Jiangning Agricultural Cooperative, Jiangning County, Jiangsu
    Promoting Advantages Without Concealing Shortcomings
    Striving to Solve Practical Problems Raised by Members

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Jiangning Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, while publicizing the advantages of agricultural cooperation to its members, is actively taking measures to solve prominent problems within the cooperative.

    During the process of publicizing the advantages of agricultural cooperation, although the members' understanding has significantly improved, they still have opinions because they feel that the problems existing within the cooperative have not been resolved in a timely manner. To this end, the cooperative held a series of meetings. On the one hand, the cooperative cadres truthfully reviewed the shortcomings and errors in their work; on the other hand, they adopted various measures to solve the prominent problems raised by the members. For example, regarding the issue of lower income for the increased production team compared to the reduced production team, the management committee studied the matter and decided to reasonably deduct the work points and cost expenses that the reduced production team did not perform last year, thus achieving reasonable income between teams. Regarding the issue of care for needy households, after in-depth inspections by the cooperative cadres, it was found that some households that did not need care were being cared for, while some households that should have been cared for were not. Therefore, corrections were made through democratic discussion and evaluation by the members. For households that should not have been cared for, it was decided to have them return the funds provided by the cooperative, or deduct them from the summer advance payments. Currently, the twenty-eight truly needy households in the cooperative have all received assistance from the cooperative. The sixteen fish ponds originally managed by the cooperative have also been handed over to the production teams for management. The cooperative also announced the financial accounts based on the members' opinions. Since the cooperative solved these prominent problems, the members' enthusiasm for production has been very high. Cooperative member Cao Qifu, seeing that the cadres earnestly corrected their shortcomings and responsibly solved the problems, now goes to the mountains to plant trees with other members every day. The cooperative's winter production has also reached a climax, with more than 540 out of 570 laborers in the cooperative working every day. More than two-thirds of the cooperative's 1,100 mu of wheat have been top-dressed with fertilizer, and all of the 140 mu of rapeseed have been top-dressed once or twice. The drainage ditches for the 2,300 mu of fields have also been cleaned once. Currently, the members are enthusiastically carrying out a fertilizer accumulation competition. In just a few days, they have carried more than 620 dan of pond mud and accumulated more than 17,000 dan of miscellaneous manure.

    宣传优越性时不掩饰工作缺点
    力求解决社员提出的实际问题
    本报讯　江苏省江宁县江宁农业社在向社员进行宣传农业合作化优越性的同时，积极采取措施，解决社内存在的突出问题。
    这个社在宣传农业合作化优越性的过程当中，虽然社员的认识有了显著提高，但是，他们看到社内存在的问题没有及时解决仍有意见。为此，社里召开了一系列会议，一方面由社干部实事求是地检讨了工作中的缺点和错误，一方面采取各种措施，解决社员提出的突出问题。如增产队收入比减产队低的问题，管理委员会研究以后，决定把减产队去年没有做的工分和没有花的成本费合理扣减，做到了队与队之间收入合理。关于困难户的照顾问题，经社干部深入检查后，发现有的不需要照顾但照顾了，有的应该照顾但未得到照顾。于是通过社员民主讨论评议，作了纠正。对不应当照顾的户，决定让他们退还社内照顾的款子，或在夏季预支中扣除。现在社里真正困难的二十八户社员，都得到了社里的帮助。原来社里经营的十六个鱼塘，也分别交给生产队经营。社里还根据社员意见公布了财务账目。自从社里解决了这些突出问题后，社员生产情绪都很高。社员曹启富看见干部认真纠正了缺点，又负责地解决了问题，现在他天天和其他社员一起上山造林。社的冬季生产也推向了高潮，全社五百七十多个劳动力，每天出勤的有五百四十多人。社里一千一百多亩小麦，有三分之二以上施了追肥，一百四十多亩油菜已全部追了一次到两次肥；二千三百多亩田的排水沟也全部清理了一次。目前，社员正热烈地开展积肥竞赛，在短短的几天内，已挑塘泥六百二十多担，积杂粪一万七千多担。
