New Technology, New Products

    New Type of Farm Tools Liked by Farmers
    A clever electric combined threshing machine has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Zhendong Joint State-Private Factory in Shenyang.
    As bundles of sorghum are fed into this combined threshing machine, the sorghum grains and sorghum stalks are automatically separated by the drum. The winnowing fan blows away impurities and broken sorghum stalks, and the sorghum grains flow out from the elevator. Three people operating this machine can thresh 20,000 jin of sorghum grains per day, which can replace the labor of forty-two people and twelve horses. It can also thresh wheat and soybeans. This factory will soon produce this type of threshing machine in large quantities to supply the countryside.
    In addition, the Zhendong and six other joint state-private factories in Shenyang have also successfully trial-produced ten new types of farm tools in the past six months, producing more than 90,000 units. The mountain plough, which is supplied to mountainous areas for reclamation, is simple in structure and lightweight, weighing only sixteen kilograms. It can reclaim four to five mu of wasteland per day and is very popular with farmers in mountainous areas. (Xinhua News Agency)
  Finnish-Style Telegraph Transceiver
    The Nanjing Xingfu Radio Repair Cooperative has successfully trial-produced a batch of Finnish-style automatic telegraph transceivers for the Meteorology Department of Nanjing University. In the past, this type of transceiver relied on imports, costing 3,000 yuan per unit, and the quantity of orders was limited. It also took two years to deliver, which could not meet the needs in a timely manner.
    This telegraph transceiver has a relatively complex structure and requires high sensitivity. The trial-produced version has been tested and proven to be of good quality.

    Rapid Multiplication and Division Calculation Chart
    With the support of the Ministry of Commerce and the Guangxi Provincial Monopoly Company, Youth League member Lin Pingsi has preliminarily developed a rapid multiplication and division calculation chart. Using one type of it – a single-type chart – to divide a five-digit number by a five-digit number only takes five seconds to calculate a four-digit accurate quotient, which is more than three times faster than a hand-cranked computer and more than twice as fast as an electric computer. If numbers with different digits are divided, the calculation takes fourteen seconds, which is also 70% faster than a hand-cranked computer. The efficiency of calculating multiplication, square roots, and division is similar. The calculation method is simple and easy to learn. Moving the chart allows one to directly obtain the calculation results. Most people can learn it within two hours.
    The calculation chart is developed based on the principle of the slide rule and the principle of adding and subtracting multiple line segments, but it has forty more line segments than a general engineering slide rule, thus increasing the accuracy by two digits.
      New Type of Viscous Oil Tank Car
    The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory has successfully trial-produced a new product – the ?12302 type viscous oil tank car.
    This viscous oil tank car is independently designed by China. The lap welds of its tank body are completely replaced by butt welds, which not only saves steel and increases vibration and impact strength, but also allows all the welding process to be carried out with automatic welding machines. The air bag is changed to an ellipse, which increases the volume, aesthetic appeal, and tank strength. (Tie Liu)

    新技术、新产品
    农民喜欢的新式农具
    一台灵巧的电动联合打谷机新近在沈阳市震东公私合营工厂试制成功。
    一束束高粱喂进这台联合打谷机后，经过滚筒，高粱粒和高粱秸就自动脱开。风车又把杂质和碎秫秸吹走，高粱粒就从升降机滚滚流出。三个人操纵这台机器，每天能够打出高粱粒两万斤，可以顶替四十二个人和十二匹马的劳动。它还可以打小麦和大豆。这个工厂即将大批生产这种打谷机，供应农村。
    除此以外，沈阳市震东等七个公私合营工厂过去半年来还试制成功了十种新式农具，共生产了九万多台。供给山区垦荒用的山地犁，构造简单轻便，重量只有十六公斤，每天能开垦四、五亩荒地，山区农民很喜爱。　（新华社）
  芬兰式电讯收发机
    南京幸福无线电修配合作社替南京大学气象系试制成功一批仿芬兰式自动电讯收发机。这种收发机过去依靠进口，每部需要人民币三千元，而且订货的数量有限制，时间上需要两年，不能及时满足需要。
    这种电讯收发机构造较复杂，灵敏度要求也高，这次仿制成功的，经过试验使用，证明质量很好。

    快速乘除计算图
    青年团员林平驷，在商业部和广西省专卖公司支持下，初步研究成功一种快速乘除计算图。曾用它的一种类型——单式图实验，以五位数除五位数，只需时五秒，就能算出四位准确的商数，比手摇计算机快三倍多，比电动计算机快一倍多。如用位数不同的数相除，计算需十四秒，也比手摇计算机快70％。算乘法、开平方和算除法效能差不多。计算方法简单易学，将图一移动就能直接得出计算结果，一般人两小时内就能学会。
    计算图是根据计算尺原理和多线段相加减的原理研究成的，但它比一般工程用的计算尺增多了四十条线段，因此也就增加了两位准确数。
      新型粘油槽车
    大连机车车辆制造工厂试制新产品——?12302型粘油槽车已经试制成功。
    这种粘油槽车，是我国独立设计的。它的罐体的搭接焊缝完全用对焊缝，不仅节约了钢材，增加振动及冲击强度，同时在焊接过程中全部可以采用自动电焊机进行焊接，空气包改成椭圆，增加了容积及美观和罐体强度。　（铁　流）
