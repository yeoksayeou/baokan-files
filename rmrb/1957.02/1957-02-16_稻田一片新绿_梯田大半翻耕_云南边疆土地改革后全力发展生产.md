Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 13th: After completing land reform through peaceful consultation in Yunnan Province's border regions, the local Party committee's focus has shifted to helping ethnic minority people comprehensively develop production. Currently, most leading personnel from Party and government organs at all levels in the border regions, along with cadres from various ethnic groups, are in the villages leading spring plowing. In the plains of Xishuangbanna, shaded by coconut trees, and in the Red River Valley, spring plowing has already begun, with the seedlings in the double-cropping rice paddies a verdant green. In the tiered terraces of the Honghe area, 50% to 70% have already been plowed for the first time.

After the completion of land reform in the ethnic minority areas of Yunnan's border region, which have a population of 1.4 million, ethnic minority farmers have been allocated land producing an average of 400 to 900 catties per person. This has liberated productive forces and greatly increased enthusiasm for production. However, the backward state of social productive forces, which was formed due to historical reasons, has not been fundamentally changed, and production materials remain insufficient. In particular, some impoverished farmers in mountainous areas still find it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. Therefore, the desire to develop production and change the face of poverty has become the main demand of farmers of all ethnic groups. From December of last year to January of this year, the Party committees of Dehong, Xishuangbanna, Honghe and other autonomous prefectures (districts) successively convened various meetings to analyze the new situation in ethnic work brought about by land reform, and to study and discuss the provincial Party committee's policy of "vigorously leading and assisting the people of all ethnic groups to comprehensively develop production, increase social wealth, and gradually realize agricultural cooperativization in the process of developing production." In Dehong region, where land reform was completed earlier, leadership over production was relaxed for a time last year, and cooperative work was carried out in isolation. After discussion at the meetings, this practice was corrected. In Xishuangbanna and other autonomous areas where land reform was recently completed, some cadres overestimated the favorable conditions for carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement after land reform, and the bias of insufficient understanding of the people's demand for production development has also begun to be reversed. Through the study at these meetings, border cadres have made further progress and improvements in their policy level, ideological awareness, and work style.

Responsible personnel from the Party committees of Xishuangbanna, Honghe, and other autonomous prefectures (districts) have recently led cadres in batches to go deep into different types of areas such as plains, mountainous areas, and high-altitude cold mountainous areas, to conduct serious investigations into the production level of agriculture, sideline occupations, and handicrafts of various ethnic groups, in preparation for formulating a comprehensive production plan for this year. Through meetings and visits, various localities have summarized the effective and crucial production experiences of the local ethnic groups in order to promote them when spring plowing begins. In the production plans formulated by various autonomous localities, in addition to ensuring increased grain production, attention is also paid to vigorously developing cash crops such as coffee, cotton, and tea. Sideline occupations and handicrafts that were neglected in the past will also be supported in a planned way, in order to invigorate the rural economy and increase the social wealth of the ethnic groups. Local autonomous organs have also formulated and announced specific policies for developing production to encourage the people of all ethnic groups to produce.

While comprehensively developing production, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in the border regions is also steadily developing.

### 稻田一片新绿　梯田大半翻耕  云南边疆土地改革后全力发展生产

    稻田一片新绿　梯田大半翻耕
    云南边疆土地改革后全力发展生产
    新华社昆明13日电　云南省边疆采用和平协商方式完成土地改革后，当地党委的领导重点，已转入帮助少数民族人民全面发展生产。现在，边疆各级党政机关的大部分负责人员和各族干部，正在村寨里领导春耕。在椰子树成荫的西双版纳平坝上和红河峡谷里，春耕已经开始，双季稻田的秧苗一片新绿。红河地区层层叠叠的梯田，已有50％到70％翻耕过第一次。
    云南边疆一百四十万人口的少数民族地区完成土地改革后，各族农民分得平均每人四百到九百斤产量的土地，生产力获得了解放，生产热情大大提高。可是由于历史原因而形成的社会生产力落后的状态，还没有根本改变，生产资料依然不足，尤其是若干山区贫困农民还难以维持生活。因此，发展生产，改变贫困面貌的愿望，已成了当前各族农民的主要要求。从去年12月到今年1月，德宏、西双版纳、红河等自治州（区）的党委先后召开各种会议，分析土地改革后引起的民族工作新形势，学习和讨论省委规定的“大力领导和帮助各族人民全面地发展生产，增加社会财富，在发展生产的过程中，逐步实现农业合作化”的方针。土地改革结束较早的德宏地区，有的地方去年曾一度放松对生产的领导，孤立地进行办社工作。经过会议讨论，这种作法得到了纠正。最近完成土地改革的西双版纳和红河等自治地方，部分干部过高估计了土地改革以后开展互助合作运动的有利条件，对各族人民要求发展生产认识不够的偏向，也已开始扭转过来。经过这些会议的学习，边疆干部在政策水平、思想觉悟、工作作风等方面，都又有若干提高和进步。
    西双版纳、红河等自治州（区）党委负责人员，最近以来又分批带领干部，深入到坝区、山区、高寒山区等不同类型地区，认真调查各个民族的农业、副业、手工业的生产水平，为制定今年全面生产计划作准备。各地通过会议和访问的方式，总结了当地各民族中行之有效、带关键性的生产经验，以便春耕开始时推广。在各自治地方拟订的生产计划中，除保证粮食增产外，都注意到大力发展咖啡、棉花、茶叶等经济作物，过去被忽视的副业和手工业也将有计划地扶持起来，以活跃农村经济，增加民族社会财富。各地自治机关还制定和宣布了发展生产的具体政策，鼓励各族人民生产。
    在全面发展生产的同时，边疆地区的农业互助合作运动也在稳步开展中。
