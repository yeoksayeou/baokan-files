Xinhua News Agency, 26th, New York dispatch: The United Nations Special Political Committee began discussing on the 25th the Soviet Union's proposal regarding US interference in the internal affairs of People's Democratic countries and US sabotage activities against these countries.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, emphasized in his speech that US interference in the internal affairs of other countries is a threat to peace and the security of all peoples. The Soviet Union's starting point in raising this issue to the United Nations is the hope to eliminate situations in international relations that hinder normal cooperation between countries, thereby promoting the normalization of the international situation and the easing of international tensions.

Kuznetsov cited examples to illustrate that sabotage activities against other countries are an integral part of US foreign policy; he also pointed out that the large-scale sabotage activities carried out by the United States against socialist countries have recently been intensified.

Kuznetsov put forward a draft resolution requesting the United Nations General Assembly to condemn the US sabotage activities against other countries as violating the United Nations Charter and not in accordance with the principles upon which relations between countries are established; requiring the US government to stop using any pretext to carry out sabotage activities against other countries and interfere in their internal affairs, and to establish US relations with other countries in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

Kuznetsov finally called on all member states of the United Nations to support this proposal. He said that a comprehensive discussion and correct resolution of this important issue will undoubtedly be conducive to easing international tensions, to establishing normal good-neighborly relations between member states of the United Nations, and to consolidating world peace.

Ignoring the specific facts listed by the head of the Soviet delegation in his speech, US representative Nolan flatly denied the accusations against the United States. Nolan insisted that the United States had no aggressive intentions and was not engaged in hostile activities aimed at undermining the people's democratic system of countries in the socialist camp. He also deliberately distorted the facts, attempting to shift the responsibility for creating international tensions to the Soviet Union. He also denied the leading role of the United States in inciting and organizing the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Nolan finally called for no resolution to be passed on this issue.

Representatives from Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria both spoke in support of the Soviet proposal. Czechoslovak representative Josef Ulih also pointed out that the United States recruits traitors and other criminals to send to Czechoslovakia to engage in espionage and sabotage activities.

    联大特别政委会讨论美国干涉社会主义国家内政问题

    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：联合国特别政治委员会25日开始讨论苏联提出的关于美国干涉人民民主国家内政和美国对这些国家进行破坏活动的问题。
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫在发言中强调指出，美国对其他国家内政的干涉是对和平和各国人民安全的威胁。苏联向联合国提出这一问题的出发点是：希望消除国际关系中妨碍各国正常合作的情况，从而促进国际局势的正常化和国际紧张局势的缓和。
    库兹涅佐夫列举事例说明，对其他国家的破坏活动是美国对外政策的组成部分；他并且说明美国对社会主义各国展开的大规模破坏活动近来更加加强了。
    库兹涅佐夫提出了一项决议草案，要求联合国大会谴责美国对别国的破坏活动违反联合国宪章、不符合各国据以建立关系的原则；要求美国政府停止用任何口实对别国进行破坏活动和干涉它们的内政，并且根据联合国宪章原则建立美国同别国的关系。
    库兹涅佐夫最后呼吁联合国各会员国支持这项提案。他说，全面讨论和正确解决这个重要问题，无疑将有利于缓和国际紧张局势，有利于建立联合国会员国之间的正常睦邻关系及巩固世界和平。
    美国代表诺兰不顾苏联代表团团长在发言中所列举的具体事实，而一味否认对美国的指责。诺兰硬说美国没有追求侵略的目的；也没有从事以破坏社会主义阵营国家人民民主制度为目的的敌视活动。他并且故意歪曲事实，企图把造成国际紧张局势的责任转嫁给苏联。他还否认美国在煽动和组织匈牙利反革命叛乱中的主导作用。
    诺兰最后呼吁不要就这一问题通过任何决议。
    捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚的代表都发言支持苏联提案。捷克斯洛伐克代表约瑟夫·乌里赫并且指出，美国征募卖国贼和其他犯罪分子派往捷克斯洛伐克从事间谍和破坏活动。
