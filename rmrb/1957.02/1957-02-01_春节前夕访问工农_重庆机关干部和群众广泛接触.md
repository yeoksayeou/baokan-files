Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 31st. To celebrate the upcoming Spring Festival, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and many other government departments are visiting workers and staff in factories and mines, farmers in nearby regions, and residents in urban neighborhoods to offer seasonal greetings and engage with the masses.

The Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions organized a visiting team of more than 200 people before the holiday. In the past six days, they visited many factories, mines, and construction sites. Through various methods, such as holding symposiums with workers and their families, conducting on-site visits, organizing small-scale discussions, paying door-to-door visits, and broadcasting messages, they extended their regards to the broad masses of workers and their families and learned about their production and living conditions. Many workers and staff in factories and mines and their families regarded the visiting team members as relatives, reporting to them their achievements on the front of increasing production and practicing economy, and their living situations. The visiting team led by Zhang Xianyi, chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, spent three days offering greetings and visiting the workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. They also visited more than 1,000 worker households in the workers' residential areas. Many family members told the visiting team members about their preparations for the New Year, such as pickling preserved meat and how happy their family would be during the Spring Festival. They also expressed their intention to save more coal and water and electricity, encourage their husbands to work hard in production, and contribute to the cause of socialist construction. Many visiting groups that went deep into iron and steel factories, machinery factories, light industrial factories, and textile factories also received many opinions and suggestions from workers on production and living aspects. The visiting team to Tianfu Coal Mine visited the miners who were working hard underground. The miners unanimously expressed their intention to continue to strive to increase production by 5,000 tons of coal during the Spring Festival to thank the Party and the trade union for their enthusiastic care.

Dozens of counties neighboring Chongqing supply a large number of non-staple foods such as pigs, cattle, sheep, and vegetables to Chongqing every year. In order to thank the local governments and farmers for their support to the big city, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee organized five visiting teams, respectively led by Chen Chou, Deputy Mayor of Chongqing, and the person in charge of the Fifth Office of the Municipal People's Committee, to visit farmers in Jiangjin, Nanchong, Jiangbei, Tongliang and other places during the Spring Festival and congratulate them on the Spring Festival. For areas far away from Chongqing, the Municipal People's Committee also sent New Year greetings letters.

The General Office of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and other government departments will also organize cadres to visit factories, rural areas, and neighborhood residents during or after the Spring Festival holiday to understand the living conditions of workers, peasants, and residents, strengthen the ties between cadres and the people, and improve the work of government departments.
