Mr. Joris Ivens is familiar to the broad masses of Chinese film audiences and Chinese filmmakers. His films, such as "Peace Will Win All Over the World" and "Song of the Rivers," have had a great influence and left an unforgettable impression on the Chinese people. This time, he was invited to visit and lecture in our country, giving Chinese filmmakers more help and leaving an even more cordial impression.

Mr. Ivens is a progressive film art master with high international prestige, and a famous documentary film director. In his nearly thirty years of artistic creation, he has created many films with high artistic achievements, making great contributions to the cause of progressive humanity. He is also a progressive political activist. His footprints have spread all over the world. He has worked for the cause of human peace and is a recipient of the International Peace Prize.

In 1938, when the Chinese people were waging the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Ivens came to China. In order to record the deeds of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, he took his camera to the front lines and various places. The film "The 400 Million" he produced recorded the facts of the War of Resistance Against Japan at that time, giving great sympathy and support to the Chinese people's just war for national liberation, and reporting this heroic struggle to the people of the world through this film.

Mr. Ivens is a good friend of Chinese filmmakers. In 1938, he was preparing to go to Yan'an and other anti-Japanese base areas, but due to various obstructions by the reactionary authorities, this wish could not be realized. So he gave his own camera to the filmmakers in Yan'an. With this camera, the film work in the liberated areas began. This camera recorded many moving epics of the heroic Chinese people in the liberation struggle on the vast land of liberation.

Since Ivens' works came out in 1927, they have attracted widespread attention due to the novelty of the subject matter and the expression techniques. Mr. Ivens has also become a world-class progressive film director and documentary filmmaker. In the past nearly thirty years, he has created many highly honored works: lyrical films such as "Rain" (1928); films reporting the labor and struggle of working people, such as "We Are Building" (1929) and "Industrial Symphony" (1930), which audiences called the "Modern Times" of documentaries; "Song of Heroes" (1932), which praises the selfless labor of members of the Soviet Communist Youth League; "The Spanish Earth" (1937), which reports the heroic struggle of the Spanish people against fascism; "The 400 Million" (1938), a film recording the Great Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan; "Our Russian Front" (1941), a film reporting the heroic Soviet people's resistance to German fascist aggression; "The First Years" (1947-1948), a film depicting the people of Eastern European people's democratic countries moving towards socialist life and peaceful labor; "Peace Will Win All Over the World" (1950) and "Song of the Rivers" (1954), films recording the world peace movement and the workers' movement. From the above-mentioned films, we can see the great achievements Mr. Ivens has achieved in the field of film art. His works are warmly welcomed by audiences in various countries around the world, and many cinemas have special screenings of his works.

In Mr. Ivens' many works in the past thirty years, there are two common characteristics: first, the masters of all his works are the broad masses of the people. Standing on the side of the people, he uses his sharp artistic weapons to express the labor of the people, encourage the people's liberation struggle, and sing praises of the people's new life. Second, his artistic creation life is closely combined with political movements. He walks in the forefront of political struggle, using his works to serve political struggle and to serve the cause of human progress and peace. His direction has become the direction of our world's progressive documentary filmmakers; his nearly thirty years of experience and works have set an example for us.

On the 6th and 7th of this month, the Capital Cinema in Beijing will have a special screening of three of Mr. Ivens' works. These three works are the gifts he brought to us this time, and they are also his representative works. The first, "Rain," was filmed in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and is a film poem. It describes the changes in the scenery of a big city when it rains. He uses film lenses for lyrical description, leaving an unforgettable impression on the audience. The second, "The Spanish Earth," was filmed in Spain and is a historical documentary that records the heroic struggle of the Spanish people against fascism and the heroic battle to defend Madrid. This film has been screened in many countries and has become a warning to those who were attempting to launch World War II at the time. The third, "Indonesia Calling," was filmed in an Australian port and is an anti-colonialist film depicting the heroic actions of Indonesian sailors who went on strike to oppose the transportation of ammunition to attack Indonesia. These films all enable the audience to get a true feeling through moving artistic expressions, especially the latter two films, which still do not lose their great historical significance when viewed today. However, it is a pity that the film "The 400 Million" could not be brought to be screened at the same time, which is a shortcoming.

Mr. Ivens' visit to China is coming to an end. As he is about to leave us, we wish him greater achievements in his artistic creation.

    约里斯·伊文思先生和他的作品	王?西
    约里斯·伊文思先生对中国广大电影观众和中国电影工作者说来是熟悉的，他所导演的影片“和平在全世界一定胜利”、“激流之歌”等，在中国人民中有了很大的影响和留下了难忘的印象。他这次应邀来我国访问和讲学，给了我国电影工作者更多的帮助并留下了更亲切的印象。
    伊文思先生是有很高国际声望的进步的电影艺术大师，著名的纪录影片导演。他将近三十年的艺术创作生活中有很多有很高艺术成就的影片，对进步人类的事业有极大的贡献。他同时也是一位进步的政治活动家，他的足迹遍及全世界，他为人类的和平事业奔走，他是国际和平奖金获得者。
    1938年，中国人民进行抗日战争的时候，伊文思先生曾经到过中国。他为了纪录中国人民抗日战争的事迹，带着摄影机到过前线和各地。他所摄制的影片“四万万人民”，纪录了当时抗日战争的事实，对于当时中国人民争取民族解放的正义战争，给予了极大的同情和支持，并且通过这部影片向全世界人民报道了这一英勇斗争。
    伊文思先生是中国电影工作者的好朋友。1938年，他准备要到延安和其他抗日根据地去，但由于反动当局的种种阻拦，没有能实现这个愿望，于是他把自己用的一架摄影机赠送给在延安的电影工作者。有了这架摄影机才开始了解放区的电影工作。这架摄影机在解放了的广阔的土地上纪录了英勇的中国人民在解放斗争中的许多可歌可泣的史诗。
    伊文思的作品在1927年开始问世后，就由于题材和表现手法的新颖而引起了广泛的重视，伊文思先生也就一跃而成为世界第一流的进步电影导演和纪录电影的摄制者。将近三十年来，他创作了很多具有很高荣誉的作品：有抒情诗式的影片如“雨”（1928年作品）；有报道劳动人民的劳动和斗争的影片，如“我们在修建”（1929年作品）和被观众称为纪录片中的“摩登时代”的“工业交响乐”（1930年作品）；有歌颂苏联共产主义青年团员忘我劳动的“英雄们之歌”（1932年作品）；有报道西班牙人民英勇反对法西斯斗争的“西班牙的土地”（1937年作品）；有纪录伟大中国人民抗日战争的影片“四万万人民”（1938年作品）；有报道英勇的苏联人民反抗德国法西斯侵略的影片“我们的俄国前线”（1941年作品）；有描写东欧人民民主国家人民走向社会主义生活与和平劳动的影片“开头的几年”（1947—1948年作品）；有纪录世界和平运动和工人运动的影片“和平在全世界一定胜利”（1950年作品）、“激流之歌”（1954年作品）。由以上所举的影片，就可以看出伊文思先生在电影艺术方面所获得的巨大成就。他的作品在世界各国都受到观众的热烈欢迎，很多电影院都为他的作品作专场映出。
    伊文思先生近三十年的许多作品中，有两个共同的特点：一是所有他的作品的主人都是广大的人民。他站在人民的立场上，用他犀利的艺术武器，去表现人民的劳动，鼓舞人民的解放斗争，歌颂人民的新生活。二是他的艺术创作生活密切地结合着政治运动。他走在政治斗争的最前线，用他的作品去为政治斗争服务，为人类的进步、和平事业服务。他的方向，成了我们全世界进步的纪录电影工作者的方向；他的近三十年的经历和作品，给我们树立了榜样。
    本月六、七两日，北京首都电影院将专场放映伊文思先生的三部作品。这三部作品是他这次带来送给我们的礼物，也是他的代表作。第一部“雨”，在荷兰阿姆斯特丹拍摄，是一部电影诗。它描写一个大城市在下雨时景色的变化。他用电影镜头进行抒情的描写，给观众留下了难忘的印象。第二部“西班牙的土地”，在西班牙拍摄，是一部历史纪录片，记载了西班牙人民反法西斯的英勇斗争，保卫马德里的英勇战斗的实况。这部影片曾经在许多国家上映，成为对当时企图掀起第二次世界大战的人们的一个警告。第三部“印度尼西亚的召唤”，在澳大利亚港口拍摄，是一部反对殖民主义的影片，描写印度尼西亚水手举行罢工反对运送军火进攻印度尼西亚的英勇行为。这些影片都通过动人的艺术表现手法，使观众得到真实的感受，特别是后两部影片在今天看来，仍不失去巨大的历史意义。但，遗憾的是，影片“四万万人民”未能带来同时上映，是美中不足的。
    伊文思先生在中国的访问就要结束了。当他快要离开我们的时候，我们预祝他的艺术创作获得更大的成就。
