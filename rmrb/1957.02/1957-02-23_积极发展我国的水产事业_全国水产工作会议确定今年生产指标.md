Actively Develop China's Aquatic Industry
National Aquatic Products Conference Determines This Year's Production Targets

(Our newspaper reports) The National Aquatic Products Conference concluded on February 20th. Attending the conference were representatives from aquatic product bureaus and departments of twenty-seven provinces and municipalities across the country, directly affiliated institutions and enterprises, and key fishery counties and districts.

The conference summarized the work of 1956 and determined the guiding principles and tasks for aquatic products work in 1957. In 1956, China's aquatic industry achieved great success, with a total production of 2.55 million tons, an increase of 34,000 tons compared to 1955, exceeding the highest pre-war annual output by 70%, ranking third in the world in terms of production. Last year, although some areas suffered from rare wind disasters and cold waves, production still increased, mainly because 91% of fishermen nationwide participated in fishery production cooperatives, fully leveraging the superiority of collective production. At the same time, the state issued a large amount of fishery loans and aquatic product investments, strongly supporting the development of the aquatic industry.

The conference believes that aquatic product departments have certain shortcomings or errors in their leadership work, mainly insufficient attention and support for mass fisheries, which account for more than 92% of the country's total aquatic production; a lack of focus on production-centered links; a deviation in grasping fish price policies at one point; and an overemphasis on large-scale water surface management in aquaculture.

The conference decided that this year's focus should be on production, with strengthened leadership of mass fisheries. In the area of mass fisheries, it is necessary to strengthen production and organizational leadership, improve the operation and management of cooperatives, and improve technical guidance. In the area of freshwater fisheries, the focus should be on solving the problem of fish fry and promoting fish farming in suburban areas to facilitate urban supply. State-owned enterprises should be actively consolidated, strengthened, and improved, with comprehensive planning carried out to steadily develop towards production modernization. The organization and leadership of the free market for aquatic products should be strengthened, price policies should be correctly implemented, and operation and management should be actively improved. The conference determined that the production target for aquatic products in 1957 is 2,816,000 tons, an increase of 7.84% over last year's production. (Hu Qingxi)

    积极发展我国的水产事业
    全国水产工作会议确定今年生产指标
    本报讯　全国水产工作会议在2月20日结束。出席这次会议的有全国二十七个省（市）的水产厅、局、直属的事业与企业单位以及重点渔业县、区的代表。
    这次会议总结了1956年的工作，确定了1957年水产工作的方针任务。1956年，我国的水产事业有很大的成就，生产总量达到二百五十五万吨，较1955年增产三万四千吨，超过战前最高年产量70％，居于世界产量的第三位。去年，部分地区虽然遭受了罕见的风灾和寒流的侵袭，而产量仍然有所增长，这主要是全国有91％的渔民参加了渔业生产合作社，充分发挥了集体生产的优越性；同时国家发放了大量的渔业贷款和水产投资，有力地支援了水产事业的发展。
    会议认为，水产部门在领导工作上有若干缺点或错误，主要是对占全国水产总产量92％以上的群众渔业重视和支持不够，对以生产为中心的环节抓得不紧，在掌握鱼价政策方面曾一度发生过偏差，在养殖方面过份强调了大水面的经营。
    会议决定今年要以生产为主，并加强群众渔业的领导。在群众渔业方面，要加强生产和组织的领导工作，改善合作社的经营管理，改进技术领导；在淡水渔业方面，着重解决鱼苗问题，并推广市郊养鱼事业，便于城市供应。对国营企业，要积极整顿、巩固、提高，并进行全面规划，稳步地向生产现代化方面发展。对水产品的供销工作，要加强自由市场的组织领导，正确执行价格政策，积极改善经营管理。会议确定，1957年水产品的生产指标是二百八十一万六千吨。比去年产量提高7.84％。（胡清禧）
