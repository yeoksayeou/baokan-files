In recent years, great achievements have been made in the work of recovering and utilizing waste materials throughout the country. According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, in the two years of 1955 and 1956 alone, the amount of seven types of waste materials recovered, including scrap copper, waste steel, tin-lead, waste rubber, miscellaneous bones, rags, and waste cotton, reached more than 1.3 million tons. Its total value is equivalent to the value of 5 billion jin of grain, which can be used to build 109 rubber, paper, cigarette and other factories within the state-stipulated quota. These waste materials can all become recycled raw materials for industry, and at the same time increase the income of the people.

However, the work of recovering and utilizing waste products is still far from sufficient. For example, in the three years from 1954 to 1956, a total of more than 16.8 million boxes of toothpaste (20 tubes per box) were sold nationwide, equivalent to more than 7,560 tons of lead, but the actual amount recovered was less than half. The national circulation of newspapers is more than 50,000 tons per year, and even less is recovered. The amount of chips from China's machinery industry is estimated to exceed 300,000 tons, but the utilization of these chips is still very poor. The recovery volume of other materials such as waste rubber, miscellaneous bones, and rags accounts for only about half of the total. It can be seen that a large part of the waste materials in society has not been fully utilized. According to a survey, Beijing produces about 3,000 cubic meters of garbage every day (1,400 jin per cubic meter), of which organic matter and ash account for about 40%. If these waste products can be scientifically formulated, 490,000 tons of granular fertilizer can be produced annually, which can be used for more than 19 million mu of farmland. In addition, each cubic meter of garbage contains more than 90 jin of rags, scrap iron, and broken glass. If all of it is picked out, the total value per year can reach more than 3 million yuan. Under the current situation of tight supply of industrial raw materials, actively collecting and utilizing these waste products has great practical significance.

There are many reasons why waste materials are not fully recovered and utilized. The main reason is that the purchasing departments in some places are too lazy and think that the collection will not be of much use, so they are not very proactive in their work. Indeed, recovering waste materials is a trivial and troublesome task. These things are scattered in various places, households, and individuals. However, as everyone knows, many waste materials are excellent raw materials for industrial production. For example, rags, waste cotton, and rope ends are raw materials for paper making. Fully utilizing these waste products can save the country hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of logs every year. The cost of paper making is also reduced significantly. The scrap copper recovered by supply and marketing cooperatives from the people over the years accounts for more than 75% of the country's copper consumption. Duck and goose feathers can be exchanged for 20 tons of steel per ton after processing for export. Other materials such as miscellaneous bones can be used as fertilizer and chemical raw materials after grinding or boiling. Fish scales are raw materials for photographic and movie film. It is clear that the supply and marketing cooperatives collect these scattered and small waste products bit by bit is not a trivial matter, but a very meaningful thing.

Some people think that after several years of recovery, there are fewer and fewer waste products in society. This statement is not true. Waste products are a widely existing material resource in society. It includes all discarded items in people's daily lives, waste materials and parts generated during production, and obsolete machines and equipment replaced year by year. As social production and consumption continue, and new and old materials are constantly replaced, waste products are constantly generated. In fact, only a small portion of materials are becoming less and less recoverable. For example, the scrap copper recovered by the state from the people is mostly used for large-scale industrial construction, and the supply of copper products to the people is very small, so of course it will become less and less recoverable. However, according to relevant departments' surveys, there is still a large stock of scrap copper nationwide. Therefore, supply and marketing departments should not relax the work of recovering these materials.

Some people also think that a little bit of waste is not worth selling, and even think that selling waste is "not honorable." This is also incorrect. Helping the country solve the difficulty of raw materials is a very glorious patriotic act, so how can it be said to be not honorable? The purchasing departments and even the leading organs in various regions and units should explain this principle clearly to all the people. At the same time, the purchasing departments should also take various measures to facilitate people selling waste products. For example, supply and marketing cooperatives can establish regular relationships with collective units such as government agencies, troops, enterprises, and schools for regular purchases. Or entrust the administrative staff of these units to collect them on their behalf. In rural areas and cities, small vendors can be used as much as possible to collect from village to village and alley to alley. Social forces such as agricultural cooperative breeders and store clerks can be entrusted by supply and marketing cooperatives to collect waste products on their behalf.

The purchase price of waste products should be able to both encourage the masses to sell waste products and not increase the production costs of factories. In many places, one jin of scrap iron can only be sold for two or three cents, and the masses cannot buy back a pack of matches even if they sell a large pile of iron. In some places, no matter how high the quality is, it is always purchased at the uniformly stipulated low price. In this way, the masses are certainly unwilling to actively sell. In order to grasp reasonable prices, purchasers must study business knowledge and correctly identify the varieties, quality, and specifications of waste products in order to implement the policy of pricing based on quality. In addition, in order to avoid increasing the circulation costs of waste products and saving the country's transportation forces, general waste products should be "purchased and used locally" or "allocated nearby."

In the case of insufficient supply of industrial raw materials, production units generally attach importance to the utilization of waste products. However, some factories one-sidedly emphasize the difficulties in production equipment and technology, and believe that the utilization of waste products cannot guarantee the quality of products, so they are unwilling to actively find ways to utilize waste products. These problems must be solved. Before waste products are put into production, they generally need to be sorted and processed, which is indeed a more complicated task. However, in the case of relatively abundant labor in our country, these difficulties are easy to overcome. Supply and marketing cooperatives are also gradually strengthening the processing, sorting and classification of waste products. Some difficulties in production equipment and technology can generally be solved as long as the broad masses of employees use their brains. For example, the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory could not use chips in the past, but later created a method of using chips to make steel in electric furnaces, saving the country more than 370,000 yuan in 1955 alone. There are many such examples in various places. The experience of many units proves that as long as the waste products are properly treated before production, the quality of the products will generally not be affected.

    应该充分回收废弃物资
    全国各地在回收和利用废弃物资的工作上近年来有很大的成绩。据中华全国供销合作总社统计，1955年和1956年两年中，仅回收杂铜、废钢铁、锡铅、废橡胶、杂骨、破布、废棉等七种废弃物资，即达一百三十多万吨。它的总值相当于五十亿斤粮食的价值，可以用来建设国家规定限额的橡胶、造纸、卷烟等工厂一百零九个。这些废弃物资都能成为工业的再生原料，同时也增加了人民群众的收入。
    但是，目前回收和利用废品的工作还做得很不够。例如，从1954年到1956年的三年中，全国卖出的牙膏共一千六百八十多万盒（每盒二十支），折合铅七千五百六十多吨，而实际回收的数量不到一半。全国每年发行的报纸在五万吨以上，回收的更少。我国机械工业的切屑量估计超过三十万吨，而目前这些切屑的利用也还很差。其他如废橡胶、杂骨、破布等的回收量，都只占一半左右。可见社会上还有很大一部分废弃物资未被充分利用。据调查，北京市每天的垃圾约有三千公方左右（每公方一千四百斤），其中有机物和灰土约占40％弱。如果这些废品能够加以科学的配制，每年可以制造颗粒肥料四十九万吨，能供一千九百多万亩农田应用。另外，每公方垃圾中有破布、废铁、碎玻璃等九十多斤，如果全部拣出来，一年的总值可达三百多万元。在目前工业原料供应紧张的情况下，积极地收集和利用这些废品具有很大的现实意义。
    废弃物资未能充分地回收和利用，原因很多。主要的原因是有些地方的收购部门嫌麻烦，认为收上来也顶不了什么大用，因此工作上很不主动。的确，回收废弃物资是一项琐碎的麻烦的工作。这些东西七零八落地分散在各处、各户、各人手里。但是，大家知道，许多废弃物资都是工业生产的上好原料。例如，破布、废棉、绳头是造纸的原料。充分利用这些废品，一年能为国家节省几十万立方公尺的原木。造纸成本也因此降低许多。供销社历年从民间回收的杂铜，占到国家用铜量的75％以上。鸭和鹅的羽毛经过加工出口，每吨可以换回二十吨钢材。其他如杂骨经过碾磨或熬制，可以成为肥料和化工原料。鱼鳞是摄影和电影胶卷的原料。供销社把这些分散零星的废品一点一滴地收集起来，显然不是无足轻重的小事，而是一件非常有意义的事情。
    有些人认为，经过几年来的回收，社会上的废品已经愈来愈少了。这种说法是不合事实的。废品是社会上广泛存在的一种物质资源。它包括人们日常生活中废弃的一切物品，生产过程中产生的废料、废件以及逐年替换的废旧机器和器材。由于社会生产和消费不断地进行，新旧物资不断地更替，所以废品也就不断地产生。事实上，目前只有一小部分物资是愈收愈少的。比如，国家从民间回收的杂铜，因为多半用于大规模的工业建设，而对民间的铜器供应量很小，当然会愈收愈少。但是，据有关部门调查，目前全国杂铜的存量仍然很多。因此供销部门对这些物资也不应当放松回收的工作。
    也有的人认为一点点破烂东西值不得出卖，甚至认为卖破烂“不光彩”。这也是不正确的想法。帮助国家解决原材料的困难，这是非常光荣的爱国行为，怎能说不光彩呢？收购部门以至各地区各单位的领导机关，应当向所有群众讲清楚这种道理。同时，收购部门还应当采取各种措施，以便人们出卖废品。比如，供销社可以和机关、部队、企业、学校等集体单位建立经常的关系，定期收购。或者委托这些单位的事务管理人员代为收集。在农村和城市中，可以尽量利用小商贩串乡串胡同收购。农业社的饲养员、商店的店员等社会力量，都可以由供销社委托代收废品。
    废品的收购价格应该是既能鼓励群众出卖废品的兴趣，又不至于增高工厂的生产成本。有不少地方，一斤废铁只能卖两三分钱，群众卖一大堆铁换不回一包火柴。有些地方则不论质量多高，总是依照统一规定的低价收购。这样，群众当然不愿意积极出卖了。为了掌握合理的价格，收购人员要学习业务知识，正确地识别废品的品种、质量、规格，以便贯彻执行按质论价的政策。另外，为了不加大废品的流转费用和节省国家的运输力量，一般的废品应该采取“就地收购、就地使用”或“近地调拨”的办法。
    在工业原料供应不足的情况下，生产单位一般都重视废品的利用。但是，也有一些工厂片面强调生产设备和技术上的困难，认为利用废品就不能保证产品的质量，因而不肯积极设法利用废品。这些问题必须解决。废品在投入生产之前，大体上要经过整理和加工，这确是一件比较繁杂的工作。但是，在我国劳动力比较充裕的情况下，这些困难是容易克服的。供销合作社也正在逐步地加强废品的加工和挑选分类工作。生产设备和技术上的一些困难，只要广大职工群众开动脑筋，一般的也可以解决。比如，四方机车车辆制造厂过去不能利用切屑，后来创造了在电炉中利用切屑炼钢的办法，仅1955年一年就为国家节约了三十七万多元。这样的例子各地都有许多。不少单位的经验证明，只要把废品在生产前处理得当，一般是不会影响产品质量的。
