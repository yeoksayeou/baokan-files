He Qinglian – The "Zhao Guilan" of the Agricultural Front
                  Kuang Luan

    At the presidium of the Hunan Province's 1956 Agricultural Labor Model Conference recently held, sat a young female breeder, He Qinglian. Because she sacrificed her right hand in labor, she is respectfully called the "Zhao Guilan" of the agricultural front.

     "Pig Nurse"
    He Qinglian is a breeder at the Quantang Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Die'fu Township, Xiangtan County. Speaking of raising pigs, He Qinglian really thinks a lot. She thought, her family had been so poor since childhood that they had to beg for food, and the whole family hoped to raise a piglet, but they could never scrape together the capital. Seeing others raising pigs always made her itch inside. Now that the cooperative has so many pigs, you couldn't even dream of it without cooperation!
    When she arrived at the pig farm, there were only a hundred or so pigs and three breeders. Because the pigsty was small, some of the pigs had to be kept in the homes of cooperative members. In addition to finishing her work at the pig farm, He Qinglian had to cross mountains and ridges every day to feed swill to the families. Before long, the other two breeders fell ill, and He Qinglian was busy with everything inside and out by herself. She couldn't sleep until midnight every day, and she was getting thinner day by day. Her sister-in-law said to her with heartache: "Look at what you've become, why do you have to raise pigs so hard!" Others also said that raising pigs is tiring, dirty, and smelly, and that feeding pigs will shorten your lifespan. These words once made He Qinglian waver, but then she thought: I've wanted to raise pigs since I was a child, and now I have a large group of pigs, so why shouldn't I raise them? Today we are engaged in socialist construction, if I don't do it, someone else has to do it; it doesn't matter if I suffer a little.
      In March, cadres from the technology promotion station came to the cooperative to promote advanced pig-raising experiences, advocating "double mating," "multiple mating," and "careful management of sows before and after farrowing," etc. This brought new problems to He Qinglian, she thought, how could a woman be embarrassed to do these strange methods? But isn't Comrade He from the promotion station also a woman? If she can do it, why can't I learn? The results of the new method experiments brought her great interest. The old sow that used to produce a maximum of nine piglets produced eighteen; and the sow that used to produce four or five piglets could now produce fourteen.
    With more piglets, the sow's teats were not enough, and there was often a phenomenon of the strong bullying the weak and the big squeezing the small. He Qinglian would drive the big ones away and wait for the small ones to eat their fill before letting the big ones eat. Before feeding, she would wash the teats clean and wipe the piglets' mouths clean to prevent them from getting sick. Sows after giving birth received extra care. The cooperative members were very satisfied with her work and gave her the title of "Pig Nurse."

          Hand Broken
      In May, the number of pigs in the cooperative increased to more than three hundred, and although the number of breeders increased, her work became more complicated. He Qinglian was responsible for carrying water, chopping vegetables, and cooking swill. One afternoon, He Qinglian had carried the water, and seeing that it was almost 4:30 and time to cook the swill, but she hadn't chopped the vegetables to put in the pot yet, she became anxious. She sat next to the chaff cutter, stepping on it non-stop, her right hand constantly reaching into the machine to turn and add the material. The chaff cutter had six gear-like blades, and when you stepped on it, the blades would spin quickly. Before long, she felt that the machine wasn't very flexible and thought there was a stick in the vegetables, so she reached in with her left hand to feel around. Heavens! She felt two fingers from the grass and fodder, they were her own fingers! When she pulled her right hand out, she saw that her palm and fingers had been cut three times, her middle finger and ring finger were gone, and her entire palm was only connected by a layer of skin, blood was flowing continuously. The people around were also anxious and quickly carried her to the county hospital. The doctor decided to amputate her right hand to save her life. After the surgery, she had a dream and still dreamed of the pigs in the pig farm. She remembered that she had medicine for two sick pigs on her, and she asked the cooperative members who carried her to take it back to the cooperative to feed the sick pigs.

          Continue to work
    He Qinglian sacrificed her hand, but she received the infinite comfort and encouragement of the cooperative and its members. The Party branch secretary, the cooperative director, and the pig farm director all came to the hospital to visit her. The cooperative sent money, and the wife of accountant Li Dehua volunteered to make two pairs of cloth shoes for her every year. In June, the Youth League branch approved her application to join the League, and the cooperative committee decided to give her "Five Guarantees" care. She was so moved that she cried.
    She stayed in the hospital for forty days. At this time, her wound had not completely healed, but she was anxious to return to the cooperative to work. The day she left the hospital, she didn't go home but first walked around the pig farm, and when she saw the pigs, she couldn't wait to return to the pig farm to work. The next day, despite the dissuasion of the cooperative cadres and her mother, she resolutely returned to the pig farm to work.

    No insurmountable difficulties
    Working with one hand is inconvenient. For example, when drawing well water, ordinary people can pull the water up with both hands going up and down. But He Qinglian also had a way. She would pull a handful with her left hand and then hold it in the hollow of her right arm, and then pull another handful with her left hand. That's how she pulled the water up, handful by handful. When cooking swill, a large pot of swill, one hand couldn't move the spatula, so she used her chest to push the spatula while working. When guarding sows about to give birth at night, she would hang the lamp on her right arm with a rope and use her left hand to help the sow give birth. That's how she stubbornly overcame difficulties and persevered in her work.

    In this year, besides being sick for more than a month, He Qinglian worked a total of more than one hundred and forty workdays.

    贺庆莲——农业战线上的“赵桂兰”
                  邝麓安
    在最近召开的湖南省1956年度农业劳动模范会议的主席台上，坐着一位年轻的女饲养员贺庆莲。因为她在劳动中牺牲了自己的右手，所以被人尊敬地称做农业战线上的“赵桂兰”。
     “猪　护　士”
    贺庆莲是湘潭县叠福乡泉塘高级农业社的饲养员。提起养猪，贺庆莲真是想得很多。她想，自家从小就穷得讨饭，一家人都望养头小猪，但总凑不到本钱，看见别人喂猪，自己心里就痒痒的。现在社里有这样多的猪，不是合作化，连梦也梦不到啊！
    她到猪场的时候，只有百来头猪，三个饲养员。因为猪舍小，一部分猪还要寄圈在社员家里。贺庆莲除了做完猪场里的事情外，每天还要翻山过坳到各家去喂潲。不久，其余两个饲养员病倒了，贺庆莲就一个人忙着搞里里外外的事情。她每天到半夜才能睡觉，人一天天的消瘦了。她的嫂子心痛地对她说：“看你成了个什么样子，何必硬要去养猪呢！”还有人说，养猪累、脏、臭，喂猪会短阳寿。这些话曾经使贺庆莲思想动摇起来，可是她又想：自己从小就想养猪，现在有一大群猪，怎么又不养了？今天我们搞社会主义建设，我不干，总得有人干；自己吃点苦算不了什么。
      3月间，技术推广站的干部到社里来推广养猪的先进经验，提倡“双重交配”、“多次交配”、“母猪分娩前后要认真管理”等等。这又给贺庆莲带来了难题，她想这些怪里怪气的办法，一个女人家怎么好意思搞？可是推广站的何同志不也是女的？她能做，我为什么不能学？新办法实验的结果，给她带来很大兴趣，原来最多产九只小猪的老母猪产了十八只；原来产四、五只小猪的猪婆也能产十四只了。
    猪崽多了，母猪奶头不够，时常发生强欺弱、大挤小的现象。贺庆莲就把大的赶开等小的吃饱后才让大的吃。吃奶前先把奶头洗干净，还要擦干净小猪的嘴，免得生病。产后的母猪得到加倍的料理。社员们对她工作十分满意，给她取了个“猪护士”的称号。
          手　断　了
      5月间，社里的猪增加到三百多头，饲养员虽然增加了，但她的工作更繁杂起来。贺庆莲要负责挑水、铡菜和煮潲。一天下午，贺庆莲挑好水，眼看四点半钟就要开潲，但是还没铡好菜下锅，心里急起来。她坐在铡草机旁边，脚踏个不停，右手一直伸到机子里面去翻料、加料。铡草机有六把像齿轮一样的刀，脚踏上去，刀子就飞快地转动，不一会，她觉得机器不大灵活，以为菜中有棍子，用左手去摸。天哪！从草料里摸到两个指头，是自己的手指呵！待把右手扯出来时，只见手掌、手指已经铡了三刀，中指和无名指不见了，整个手掌只剩下一层皮连着，血一直在流。旁人看见也急坏了，赶紧把她抬到县城的医院里去。医生为了挽救她的生命决定锯掉她的右手。手术完毕后，她做了个梦，还梦见猪场里的猪，她还记得有两条病猪的药在她身上，她要求抬她来的社员拿回社去给病猪吃。
          继续干下去
    贺庆莲牺牲了自己的手，却得到了社和社员对她无限的安慰和鼓励。党的支书，社主任，猪场主任都到医院来看望她，社里送来了钱，会计李德华的爱人自愿每年做两双布鞋送给她。6月间团支部批准了她的入团申请，社委会又决定给她“五保”照顾。她激动得哭了起来。
    她在医院住了四十天，这时伤口没有完全好，可是她急着回社里工作了。出医院那天，她没到家就先绕着猪场打了个转，看到了猪，恨不得马上能回到猪场里去工作。第二天，不管社里干部和母亲的劝阻，她坚决地回到猪场工作了。
    没有不可克服的困难
    一只手工作是不方便的。比如打井水，一般人可以两只手一上一下的拉上水来。可是贺庆莲也有了办法，她用左手拉一把就挟在右臂的胁窝处，左手再去拉，就这样拉一把挟一把地打上水来。煮潲时一大锅潲，一个手是推不动锅铲的，她就用胸膛挺着铲子工作。晚上守护临产母猪，就用绳子把灯挂在右手臂上，左手来给母猪助产。她就是这样顽强地战胜困难，坚持着工作。
    这一年，贺庆莲除了一个多月在养病外，她一共做了一百四十多个劳动日。
