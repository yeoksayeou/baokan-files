Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, February 23rd: From January to February 20th this year, Kailuan Coal Mine workers produced an additional 61,142 tons of raw coal, exceeding the first quarter's plan to increase raw coal production by 45,000 tons ahead of schedule. The ash content of the coal was 0.39% lower than the national standard, saving 1,092 cubic meters of pit wood.

    To increase the production of raw coal, the mine workers promoted more than 50 kinds of advanced experiences based on the key problems existing in production, which greatly improved production efficiency. All scraper conveyor teams have adopted the Linxi Mine Wang Fengyuan team's experience of quickly moving scraper conveyors, and the work efficiency has increased by an average of one time compared with the past. The mining face has adopted the experience of the Soviet coal mine comprehensive coal mining team and cyclic operation, and the coal mining efficiency has increased by 50% compared with the past.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 23rd: China's largest newsprint mill, the Guangzhou Paper Mill, has exceeded the state plan for February ahead of schedule by the 20th. It is estimated that by the end of this month, it can produce another 900 tons of newsprint. As early as the first month of this year, it had already increased production by 459 tons of paper. The paper produced in these two months can supply 65.52 million copies of a broadsheet newspaper.

    The main reason for the increase in production in this paper mill is that in the second half of January, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in "eliminating resin obstacles" was promoted. In the past, due to the excessive resin content of the wood used as raw material for papermaking, obstacles were caused during production, often requiring machine shutdowns for cleaning, reducing effective operating time and affecting the quality of the paper. Now, because of the method of adding clay to the pulp to coat the resin, eliminate the stickiness, and remove the obstacles, the production efficiency and paper quality have been improved.

### 开滦矿完成第一季度增产计划  广州造纸厂超额完成二月份生产任务

    开滦矿完成第一季度增产计划
    广州造纸厂超额完成二月份生产任务
    新华社唐山23日电　开滦煤矿职工从今年1月到2月20日，共增产原煤六万一千一百四十二吨，提前超额完成了第一季度增产原煤四万五千吨的计划；煤的灰分比国家指标降低了0.39％，节省坑木一千零九十二立方公尺。
    这个矿职工为了增产原煤，根据生产中存在的关键推行了五十多种先进经验，大大提高了生产效率。所有移溜子小组都推行了林西矿王凤元小组快速移溜子的经验，工作效率平均比过去提高一倍；回采工作面推行了苏联煤矿综合采煤队和循环作业等经验，采煤效率比过去提高50％。
    新华社广州23日电　我国最大的新闻纸厂——广州造纸厂到20日为止，提前超额完成了二月份的国家计划；估计到本月底，还可以多生产九百吨新闻纸。早在今年的头一个月里，它已经增产了四百五十九吨纸。这两个月增产的纸张，可以供一种对开的报纸发行六千五百五十二万份。
    这家纸厂增产的主要原因，是在1月下半月推广了苏联“消除树脂障碍”的先进经验。过去由于作为造纸原料的木材树脂成分过大，在生产时造成了障碍，常常要停机清洗，减少了有效作业时间，而且影响纸张的质量，现在因为采用在化浆里掺入白土的办法，使树脂包住，消除粘性，去掉了障碍，因而提高了生产效率和纸张的质量。
