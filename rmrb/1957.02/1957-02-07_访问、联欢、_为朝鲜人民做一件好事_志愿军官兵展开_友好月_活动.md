Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 6th: The "Friendship Month" activities of the Chinese People's Volunteers, from the Spring Festival to the Korean People's Army Founding Day, are being enthusiastically launched.

On the evening of the 2nd, the leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers held a get-together, gathering together with generals, officers, and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, as well as local Korean government personnel, "Minchong" members, miners, and students. Volunteer Army youth soldiers, wearing national costumes, performed lion dances and flower stick dances for the guests. A Korean girl invited a gray-haired Volunteer Army general to do the Yangko dance. The venue was filled with international friendship as warm as spring.

On the west coast, Volunteer Army officers and soldiers are universally carrying out the activity of "doing a good deed for the Korean people." Some soldiers went to the snow-covered mountains to chop firewood for the Korean landlord, while others helped Korean agricultural cooperatives carry lumber and build houses. While the Volunteer Army units sent representatives to visit local agricultural cooperatives, Korean farmers on the west coast also organized twenty-four delegations and seven performance teams, bringing letters of慰问 and gifts to visit the troops. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army stationed near Yangdeok specifically sent representatives to visit the nearby Korean People's Army Hospital, extending cordial greetings to the People's Army convalescents and organizing film evenings for them.

Volunteer Army units stationed in areas such as Seongcheon and Cheorwon sent many visiting groups to visit local Korean Party and government organs, factories, schools, families of Korean People's Army soldiers and martyrs, and the people, to solicit the opinions of the Korean people on the Volunteer Army and to discuss matters concerning the Volunteer Army's assistance to the Korean people in production and construction this year. Many units also organized health personnel to treat and prevent diseases for the Korean people.

    志愿军官兵展开“友好月”活动
    新华社平壤6日电　中国人民志愿军从春节到朝鲜人民军建军节期间的“友好月”活动，正在热烈展开。
    志愿军领导机关2日晚举行联欢会，同朝鲜人民军的将军、军官、士兵们以及当地朝鲜政府人员、“民青”盟员、矿工、学生等共聚一堂。志愿军青年士兵穿着民族服装，为客人们表演了狮子舞和花棍舞，朝鲜小姑娘邀请头发斑白的志愿军将军扭秧歌，会场内洋溢着春天一样温暖的国际友情。
    在西海岸，志愿军官兵普遍展开“为朝鲜人民做一件好事”的活动。有些战士到大雪封冻的山上去为朝鲜老房东打柴，有些战士帮助朝鲜的农业合作社扛运木料，修盖房屋。在志愿军部队派代表访问当地农业社的同时，西海岸的朝鲜农民也组织了二十四个代表团、七个演出队，带着慰问信和礼物来到部队访问。驻在阳德附近的志愿军某部特别派代表访问了附近的朝鲜人民军医院，亲切慰问人民军休养员，为他们组织了电影晚会。
    驻在成川、铁原等地区的志愿军部队派出许多访问小组，访问了驻地朝鲜党政机关、工厂、学校、人民军军属和烈士家属以及人民群众，征求朝鲜人民对志愿军的意见，并且商量今年志愿军帮助朝鲜人民生产建设的事宜。许多部队还组织卫生人员为朝鲜人民治病、防疫。
