Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: According to TASS, New York, February 10th: The 16th National Convention of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) opened in New York on the 9th. Nearly 300 delegates representing party organizations from more than thirty states attended the convention.

The morning session elected the presidium of the congress and other working bodies. Reporters were not allowed to attend the first meeting because, according to the chairman of the convention's press committee, some delegates would lose their jobs if the list of attendees was published, given the current persecution of communists in the United States.

The Party Congress is being held under extremely difficult circumstances. Six members of the Party's National Committee—Elizabeth Flynn, Gilbert Green, Gus Hall, Pettis Perry, Robert Thompson, and Henry Winston—are still imprisoned under the Smith Act; many other party activists have also been sentenced to imprisonment, and some leaders are awaiting trial.

The U.S. State Department refused to issue visas to delegations from other countries' communist and workers' parties who were preparing to attend the congress in the United States. The Communist Party USA faced great difficulties in finding a venue for the congress. The owners of twenty hotels and forty halls refused to rent out their facilities. After much difficulty, the Party's leadership managed to rent a small meeting hall in a slum. According to participants in the congress, the building was not only surrounded by police, but also by suspicious individuals carrying press passes and cameras. Most reporters denied that these suspicious individuals were journalists, giving grounds to believe that they were agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In view of the absence of reporters from the meeting on the 9th, a spokesman for the Party briefed reporters in detail on the convention's proceedings and distributed speeches and other documents for newspaper use.

Many fraternal communist and workers' parties from abroad sent telegrams congratulating the Communist Party USA on this convention. The delegates expressed great joy when these congratulatory messages were read out at the convention.

The morning session on the 9th adopted a telegram to President Eisenhower, demanding that he take measures to stop the racist terror against black people.

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: According to TASS, New York: At the opening session of the 16th National Convention of the Communist Party USA, a congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the convention was read out.

The CPSU Central Committee's congratulatory message stated that Soviet communists were watching with deep sympathy how the Communist Party USA was overcoming the enormous difficulties it had encountered in recent years.

"The entire activity and struggle of your Party proves that your Party has no other interests than the interests of the American working class and all working people. The Communist Party USA has consistently defended the democratic rights of the American people, inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions of Lincoln, Jefferson, Debs, Rosenberg, and other outstanding American sons and daughters.

"The Party has been exposing the plots of imperialist aggressive blocs attempting to plunge the people of all countries into a new abyss of war. The communists of America are waging a tenacious struggle to defend the Party and to strengthen the Party's unity based on the long-tested principles of Marxism-Leninism. In the struggle for the vital rights of the working class, the Communist Party USA has always strived to maintain fraternal ideological ties with other communist and workers' parties, ties built on the principles of proletarian internationalism, which are held sacred by advanced workers in all countries."

The congratulatory message wished the Communist Party USA success in the struggle for the democratic rights of the American people, for the vital interests of the American working class and all working people, and for further consolidating the Party ideologically and organizationally.

The congratulatory message concluded by wishing that the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and American peoples would be strengthened and developed for the benefit of the Soviet and American peoples and for the benefit of world peace.

    美共全国大会宣读兄弟党贺电
    大会要求美总统制止迫害黑人
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会9日在纽约开幕。参加这次代表大会的有代表三十多个州的党组织的将近三百名代表。
    上午会议选出了代表大会主席团和其他工作机构。第一次会议没有让记者参加，因为据代表大会新闻委员会主席的解释，在目前美国迫害共产党的情况下，如果公布了出席代表的名单，某些代表将会失掉工作。
    党的代表大会是在极其困难的情况下召开的。党全国委员会六位委员——伊丽沙白·弗林、吉伯特·格林、葛斯·霍尔、佩蒂斯·佩里、罗伯特·汤姆逊、亨利·温斯顿仍然在史密斯法的罪名下被监禁在狱中；党的其他许多活动家也被判处监禁，还有一些领袖正在听候审判。
    美国国务院拒绝发给准备到美国参加代表大会的其他国家共产党和工人党代表团以签证。美国共产党是在非常困难的情况下才找到了召开代表大会的会场的。有二十家旅馆和四十家大厅的主人拒绝出租会场。党的领导机构经过许多周折才在贫民区租到了一间不大的会议厅。据大会的参加者说，这所房子周围不仅布满警察，而且还可以看到持有记者证和照像机的可疑人物。大多数记者否认这些可疑人物是采访记者，这使人们有根据认为他们是联邦调查局的密探。
    鉴于记者们没有出席9日的会议，党的发言人向记者们详细地谈了大会的情况，并散发了演讲稿和其他文件供报纸采用。
    国外许多兄弟共产党和工人党打电报祝贺美国共产党这次代表大会。在大会宣读这些贺电时，出席代表表现了极大的欢欣鼓舞之情。
    9日上午的会议通过了给艾森豪威尔总统的一封电报，要求他采取措施制止对黑人的种族主义恐怖。
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会开幕会议上宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会给代表大会的贺电。
    苏共中央的贺电说，苏联共产党人深深同情地注视着美国共产党如何克服近年来所遭到的巨大的困难。
    “你们党的全部活动和斗争证明，除了美国工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益外，你们党再没有其他的利益。美国共产党一贯保卫美国人民的民主权利，继承和发扬林肯、杰斐逊、德布斯鲁森堡和其他美国卓越的儿子的优良传统。
    “党一直在揭露帝国主义侵略集团企图把各国人民投入新的战争深渊的阴谋。美国共产党人正在为保卫党、为根据久经考验的马克思列宁主义原则加强党的团结而顽强地进行斗争。美国共产党在争取工人阶级切身权利的斗争中，一向努力同其他共产党和工人党保持兄弟般的思想联系，这种联系是建立在各国先进工人视为神圣的无产阶级国际主义原则上的。”
    贺电祝美国共产党在争取美国人民的民主权利、争取美国工人阶级和全体劳动人民的切身利益以及争取在思想上和组织上进一步巩固党的斗争中获得成就。
    贺电最后祝苏联和美国人民的友谊和合作得到加强和发展，以造福苏美两国并利于世界和平。
