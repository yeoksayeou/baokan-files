Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, Tokyo Dispatch: A national convention demanding the return of administrative rights over Okinawa was held in Tokyo today. The convention resolved to demand that the United States return administrative rights over Okinawa to Japan.

The convention was jointly sponsored by seventeen organizations including the Japan Youth League Council, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomy Associations, the All-Japan Buddhist Association, as well as farmers and women's groups. Approximately six thousand people including workers, students, women, and citizens attended.

The resolution stated that Okinawa is Japanese territory and its residents are also Japanese people, therefore we firmly oppose the United States' attempt to permanently occupy Okinawa.

The convention resolved to appeal to the United Nations and countries around the world about the current situation in Okinawa under American rule, and to urge the United Nations to send a delegation to investigate Okinawa. It demanded that the United States guarantee basic human rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and publication in Okinawa; abolish discriminatory treatment in wages and labor conditions based on race; and oppose the transportation of nuclear forces into Okinawa.

The convention also passed a declaration calling on the Japanese people to unite and struggle to realize the above demands; and elected representatives to petition the Japanese government to actively work towards achieving these goals.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, Tokyo Dispatch: Many Japanese mass organizations have decided to convene a meeting of representatives from various groups in Tokyo on February 28th, the fifth anniversary of the signing of the "Administrative Agreement" between Japan and the United States, to abolish unequal treaties and support the struggle against the Sunagawa base. The meeting will discuss issues such as demanding that the Japanese government abolish unequal treaties and remove U.S. military bases.

This decision was made at the joint meeting of measures against the Sunagawa base struggle held on the 21st. Participants in this joint meeting included the Japan National Anti-Military Base Conference, the Japan Peace Committee, the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomy Associations, the Sunagawa Town Anti-Base Expansion Alliance, and the Union Council to Support the Sunagawa Base Struggle.
