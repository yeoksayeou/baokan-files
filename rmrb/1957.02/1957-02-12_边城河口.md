　　The car glides along the Bihe line. The terrain is getting lower and the weather is getting hotter. Butterflies flutter, and cicadas screech. Here is a lush green wild banana forest, and there are several fiery red *Bombax ceiba* trees, coupled with the bright and varied scenery of mountains and rivers, which is simply overwhelming.

　　Turning around a small hill, a majestic iron bridge spans the Nanxi River. Immediately afterwards, a city is displayed in front of you, and the car stops. This is Hekou, which is next to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This bridge connecting China and Vietnam is busy. By the bridge, stack after stack of steel rails are transported from Munankuan, through Vietnam, and then across this bridge. The cement that Vietnam supports us with has also been transported over, more than 600 tons. Every morning, more than 60 Chinese and Vietnamese small vendors come and go, supplying tomatoes, Saigon bananas, etc., to the residents of Hekou, and supplying fabrics, batteries, etc., to the market in Lao Cai.

　　Defen Street is not very long, but it is very clean and elegant. I have never seen a street decorated with *Delonix regia*, longan trees, and pineapple trees like this. This city, the only one in Yunnan that can be called a true tropical city, is still hot even now, but there are very few flies and mosquitoes. Could this be the miasma land that everyone used to dread? I'm a little confused. An old lady named Chen gave me the following account: It's true, this used to be a miasma land. When the French built the railway here, our laborers died in droves. People said that only we Cantonese and Vietnamese overseas Chinese could stand it. In fact, we had to get "silent sickness" and die without saying a word. Twenty-eight years ago, more than 100 people died in three days. Even just after liberation, the city was full of weeds as tall as a person, garbage was everywhere, and people died every two or three days, and no one even carried the corpses off the street. In December 1952, the people's government led us to launch a sanitation campaign, removed weeds, eliminated mosquitoes and flies, and spent 2,000 workdays filling in the stinky ditch behind the city, which made it look like it does now. Now everyone is used to it, and we have a major cleaning every Saturday. In recent years, we have rarely heard of people dying from serious illnesses. A Vietnamese overseas Chinese named Chen Wenmei narrated another matter. He said: In the past, adults were prone to get sick, and children were even harder to raise. There were few children on the whole street. His wife had given birth to several children, and even he couldn't remember how many, but he only had one left. He had another one after liberation. His neighbor, Chen Wenfeng, had four children in the past, and none of them survived; now he has a four-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl, and his wife is pregnant again. He is a carpenter, and now his wages are reasonable, and there is a lot of work to do. Life is no longer as difficult as it used to be. Chen Wenmei smiled and said: In the new society, the lives of us overseas Vietnamese have also changed.

　　On Guangling Street, you can see portraits of Chairman Mao and President Ho Chi Minh hanging side by side in many houses. A comrade from the town told me that most of these are overseas Vietnamese. Of the 360 households in this city, 98 are overseas Vietnamese. In the past, they and we suffered from the oppression of reactionaries at home and abroad, and now they have begun a new life together under the leadership of the Communist Party. They and the Chinese residents have organized cooperatives, and the barbershop here is jointly formed by overseas Vietnamese and Chinese residents. In rural areas, there are also agricultural cooperatives with the participation of overseas Vietnamese. In the state-owned tropical crop experimental farm, there are also 45 overseas Vietnamese working hard to develop tropical crops in our country.

　　Not only that, many of the eleven ethnic groups living here, including Han, Miao, Yao, Nong, and Dai..., have relatives in Vietnam. A comrade from the county committee took us to visit Sha Ren Huang Jin's family, who were busy making *zongzi*. He said that his sister often comes to visit him. On the way back, the comrade from the county committee said: On the 500-li-long border line of Hekou County, the border residents of China and Vietnam are also so closely connected. Here, mountains are connected to mountains, water is connected to water, and the same ethnic groups such as Nong and Yao live on both sides. They help each other like brothers. In Bazhi, there are more than a dozen Nong people, and they carry tofu and corn to Vietnam to grind. Some time ago, in Longtang, Bazhi River, more than 400 Yao people from both sides jointly caught fish, which lasted a whole day and night. Last year in Yangpeng, two Yao girls sang folk songs with Vietnamese Yao youths on the border line, and they fell in love and got married. As for cows running over and chickens running over, that is even more common.

　　In the city, we also visited the fort on Xiaoshan Road. The fort faces the China-Vietnam Iron Bridge and was built in the Qing Dynasty to defend against the invasion of French imperialism that occupied Vietnam. Three years before the Xinhai Revolution, the revolutionary Huang Xing seized this fort during the Hekou Uprising. In the early days of liberation, our working comrades used to work here. During the Anti-Japanese War, this once prosperous city of Hekou was almost turned into ruins. Until liberation, there was a severe shortage of houses. The mountain pack that stands tall with buildings now was a wasteland taller than a person back then, so the fort became a good place to work. Now, this fort has become a scenic spot for people to visit.

　　On the side of the main street in the city, a small papaya tree bears fifty or sixty fruits. The same lemon tree is blooming and bearing fruit at the same time, and it is said that it is like this all year round. Jackfruit is blooming, spitting out "small fruits" the size of teacups; when they are ripe, two are enough for one person to hold. The longan tree is blooming. Betel nut trees stand tall next to the houses. Coconuts, coffee, bananas, pineapples, as well as *Magnolia coco* and *Michelia alba* cover the mountainside. In the black soil, there are sparkling spots everywhere, which are valuable mica flakes. As long as you have a small hoe, you can dig up a pile in no time.

　　Hekou City is not big, but it is prosperous. There is a department store, a Xinhua Bookstore, a hospital, a middle school, a cultural center, as well as a tropical crop experimental farm and a meteorological station. The flat streets, tall buildings, and lush ornamental trees, whether in the sunlight or under the electric lights, make people feel prosperous and comfortable.

　　Hekou is one of the important areas for the development of tropical economic crops in our country. After the completion of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and after hundreds of thousands of acres of rubber, tens of thousands of acres of coffee, pepper, and oil palm begin production, it will become more prosperous and more flourishing.

    边城河口
    章皆淳
    汽车在碧河线上滑行着。地势越来越低，天气也越来越热。粉蝶翩翩飞舞，知了声声嘶唤。这里是一片青葱葱的野芭蕉林子，那边是几株红艳艳的攀枝花，再加上明媚多变的山水，简直使人应接不暇。
    拐过一个小山包，一座雄巍的铁桥横跨在南溪河上。紧接着，一个城市已展现在眼前，汽车停了下来，这已是到达紧挨越南民主共和国的河口了。这座联接中越两国的桥梁是繁忙的。桥边一码码的钢轨，就是由睦南关运经越南再经这座大桥运过来的。越南支援我们的水泥，也已运过来六百多吨。每天上午还有六十多个中越两国的小商贩来来往往，把西红柿、西贡蕉，等等，供给河口的居民，把布匹、电池等等供应老街的市场。
    德芬街并不很长，却非常整洁、雅致，我还没有见过这样为凤凰树、龙眼树和菠萝树所点缀起来的街道。这个在云南惟一可称做真正的热带的城市，就是现在，天气也是炎热的，但是苍蝇蚊子却很少见。难道这就是过去人人视为畏途的瘴烟之地吗？我有些迷惑了。一位姓陈的老大妈给我作了如下的叙述：一点不假，过去这里就是瘴烟之地，法国人在这里修筑铁路时，我们民工死得一片一片的。人家说只有我们两广人和越侨经得起，其实，得上
  “闷头摆”，还不是不讲一句话就死掉。二十八年前，有一次三天内就死了一百多人。就是刚解放时，城里还是荒草人样高，垃圾遍地是，三天两头有死人，甚至人死在街上都没人抬。1952年12月，人民政府领导我们展开了卫生运动，铲除了杂草，消灭了蚊子苍蝇，还花了两千个工填了后边的臭水坑，才闹成现在这种样子。现在大家也都成习惯了，一到星期六就大扫除。这几年来得恶病死的人是很少听到了。一个名叫陈文美的越南侨民，叙述了另外一件事情。他说：过去大人容易得病，小孩更难养活，整条街小孩没有几个。他妻子生过几个孩子，连他自己也难以记清了，可是总共就只留下一个，解放后才又养了一个。他的邻居陈文逢，过去他妻子生过四个孩子，一个也没留下；现在已有一个四岁的男孩和一个两岁的女孩，妻子又怀孕了。他是个木匠，现在工资合理，工作也多，生活再也不像过去那样难过了。陈文美笑了笑说：到了新社会，我们越侨的生活同样也变了样。
    在广龄街，许多屏里都可以看见毛主席像和胡志明主席像肩并肩地挂着。一位镇上的同志告诉我，这些大多是越侨。这个三百六十户的城市，越侨就有九十八户。在过去，他们和我们一道遭受过国内外反动派的压迫，现在又一道在共产党领导下开始了新的生活。他们和中国居民一道组织了合作社，这里的理发馆就是越侨和中国居民一道组成的。在农村，同样也有越侨参加的农业社。在国营热带作物试验场里，还有四十五位越侨为发展我国的热带作物辛勤劳动着。
    不仅如此，这里居住着的汉、苗、瑶、侬、傣……等十一个民族，有许多都和越方边民有着亲戚关系。县委会的一位同志带我们访问了沙人黄金全家，他家正在忙着包粽子。他说他姐姐平时还常来探望。在回来的路上，县委会的同志说：在河口县五百里长的国境线上，中越两国的边民也是这样亲密地联系着的。这里正是山连着山、水连着水，两边又是同样住着侬、瑶等民族，他们互相帮助有如亲兄弟一样。在坝治住着十多户侬族人民，他们磨豆腐、包谷都抬到越南那边去磨。前些日子，在八字河的龙塘，双方瑶族四百多人合伙拿鱼，整整拿了一天一夜。去年在杨棚，有两个瑶族姑娘在国境线上和越南瑶族青年对唱山歌，唱得情投意合就结了婚。至于牛跑过来、鸡跑过去之类那更是平常的事了。
    在城内，我们还参观了小山道上的炮台。炮台正对着中越大铁桥，是清代为防守侵占越南的法帝国主义的侵入而建的。辛亥革命前三年，革命党人黄兴在河口起义时，曾夺取了这炮台。解放初期，我们的工作同志曾在这里面办过公。抗日战争时，这个曾经繁荣一时的河口城几乎变成了废墟。直到解放时，房子还是非常缺乏。现在屹立着一幢幢楼房的山包，那时还是一片比人还高的荒草，于是炮台也就成了办公的好地方。现在，这座炮台已作为名胜供人游览了。
    在城里的大街旁，一株不大的木瓜树，就结上五、六十个果。同一株柠檬，又开着花又结着果，据说一年四季都是如此的。木菠萝正在开花，吐出茶杯大的“小果果”；它到成熟时，两个就够人拿的。龙眼树开着花。槟榔树高耸在屋旁。椰子、咖啡、香蕉、菠萝以及木姜花、缅桂花布满山坡。黑色的泥土里，处处闪耀着点点的光，这是贵重的矿物云母片。你只要有一把小锄头，不一会就可挖它一堆。
    河口城并不大，但它是繁华的。这里有百货公司、有新华书店，有医院、中学、文化馆，还有热带作物试验场和气象站。平坦的街道、高大的房子，加上繁茂的风景树，不论是在太阳光下，还是电灯光下，都使人感到景气而舒适。
    河口是我国发展热带经济作物的重要地区之一。在滇越铁路通车以后，在数十万亩的橡胶，数万亩的咖啡、胡椒、油棕开始生产以后，这里将要更富庶更繁荣。
