Guangzhou Sanyuanli Agricultural Cooperative
Begins Early Rice Preparations and Spring Vegetable Planting

(Our Dispatch) The spring breeze has swept through the countryside on both sides of the Pearl River, setting off a wave of labor enthusiasm in the fields. In the suburbs of Guangzhou, the members of the Sanyuanli Agricultural Cooperative, whose average household income last year was 741 yuan, have begun their busy and intense work of preparing for early rice and planting spring vegetables.

The more than 2,000 mu of land that the cooperative plowed before the Spring Festival has been dried loose and crumbly by the sun. The members are working hard to shovel the ground, raise ridges, break up the soil, fertilize, and irrigate, striving to plant spring-sown and spring-harvested vegetables on more than 400 mu of land before the early rice transplanting. Starting from the Beginning of Spring, these vegetables will be successively soaked and sown, and then transplanted on a large scale. Twenty days later, the harrowing and sowing of more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields will have to begin immediately.

In order to strive for a greater harvest, water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation are also being stepped up simultaneously. Every day, more than 100 members go to the mountains to participate in the ditch interception and water storage project. Starting at midnight, seventy or eighty members pull sixty carts to Guangzhou City to transport urine, bringing back about 400 dan every night. The village has accumulated more than 20,000 dan of manure. Several members who make "nutritional soil blocks" work non-stop all day long, racing to produce 170,000 blocks to cultivate vegetable seedlings.

    广州三元里农业社
    开始早稻备耕和春种瓜菜
    本报讯　春风已经吹遍珠江两岸的农村，田野上掀起了一片劳动热潮。在广州郊区，去年平均每户收入七百四十一元的三元里农业社的社员们，忙碌紧张地开始了早稻备耕和春种瓜菜的工作。
    这个社在春节前翻犁过的二千多亩土地，已被阳光晒得松松脆脆。社员们紧张地锹地、起垅、碎土、施肥和灌水，争取早稻插秧以前在四百多亩地里种下春种春收的瓜菜。立春起，这批瓜菜就将陆续浸种播种和大规模移植。二十多天以后，一千多亩水稻的耙田播种工作又得紧接着开始。
    为争取更大的丰收，修水利和积肥也同时加紧进行。每天都有一百多个社员到山上去参加截坑贮水工程。半夜开始，七、八十个社员拉着六十部板车就出动到广州市去载运尿水，每晚能拉回四百担左右。村里积集的厩肥已有二万多担。制造“营养土方”的几个社员，一天到晚不停地工作，要赶制出十七万块来培育瓜菜种苗。
