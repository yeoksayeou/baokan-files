Construction News

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, February 7th. A relatively large thermal power plant in Hunan, the state-owned Liyujiang Power Plant, has been completed and formally handed over for production recently.
    The power generation capacity of this power plant is 1.8 times the total power generation capacity of the self-provided power generation equipment of various mines in southern Hunan. The electricity generated by this power plant can not only supply electricity to many mines such as Zixing, Xiangyong, and Matian, but also be transmitted to more distant places through the substation of the state-owned Zixing Coal Mine. In the past, the production tasks and basic construction projects of mines such as Zixing and Xiangyong Coal Mines were restricted due to insufficient power supply. After this power plant generates electricity, the difficulty of insufficient power supply in this area will be basically solved.
    The main equipment of the Liyujiang Power Plant is assembled using old and unusable equipment. After two years of construction, the "waste" has now been transformed into a highly mechanized power plant.

### 湖南鲤鱼江发电厂建成

    湖南鲤鱼江发电厂建成
    新华社长沙7日电　湖南一个规模较大的火力发电厂——国营鲤鱼江发电厂已经建成，最近正式移交生产。
    这座电厂发电容量等于湖南南部地区各矿山自备发电设备总发电容量的一点八倍。这座电厂发出的电力，不仅可以供应资兴、湘永、马田等许多矿山用电，而且可以通过国营资兴煤矿的变电站，输送到更远的地方去。过去，资兴、湘永煤矿等矿山因为电源不足，生产任务和基本建设工程都受到限制。这座电厂发电以后，这个地区供电不足的困难就会得到基本解决。
    鲤鱼江发电厂的主要设备都是利用残旧不堪的旧设备装配而成的，经过两年的修建，现在“废物”已经变成了高度机械化的发电厂。
