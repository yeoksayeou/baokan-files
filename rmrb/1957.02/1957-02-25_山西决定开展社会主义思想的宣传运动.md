Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided on the 23rd to launch a widespread socialist ideological education campaign throughout the province from now until the end of June this year.

The "Decision on Strengthening Ideological Work of the Party" made by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the 23rd states that the purpose of carrying out this education campaign is to enable the broad masses of people to distinguish between right and wrong and between ourselves and the enemy, to further strengthen the ties between the Party and the people, to mobilize all positive factors to overcome all negative factors, to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work, and to promote the development of the increased production and thrift campaign and the agricultural bumper harvest campaign this year.

This decision provides a detailed analysis of the ideological trends of people from all walks of life and within the Party in the province, and focuses on analyzing the manifestations of all current erroneous ideas and the root causes of these erroneous ideas, regarding erroneous ideas as an objectively existing social phenomenon that is opposed to correct ideas, and not concealing them, but rather adopting the method of patiently persuading and educating the people to solve them.

This education campaign will, in accordance with the spirit of the article "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship Again," focus on conducting education among the people on proletarian internationalism, the basic experience of the Soviet revolution and construction, and the correct relationships between developing production and improving life, individual and collective, democracy and centralism, democracy and dictatorship, and the Party and the masses. Through discussions, reports by leading cadres, and other methods, correct ideas will be affirmed and erroneous ideas will be criticized. Furthermore, various correct demands and criticisms will be humbly accepted in the discussions.

In order to ensure the healthy development of this education campaign, the decision requires the secretaries of Party committees at all levels and the main leaders of various systems to personally take charge, investigate and study the ideological trends of people from all walks of life, and directly guide the development of this campaign. At the same time, attention should be paid to fully utilizing the role of the Communist Youth League as an assistant in the campaign, and young students should continue to receive class education, labor education, and revolutionary tradition education, in order to overcome their undesirable tendencies to be unwilling to participate in labor production, especially to go to the countryside to engage in production or work.

This decision also requires Party organizations at all levels to regularize and institutionalize the Party's political and ideological work. All work departments of the Party committee should divide the responsibility for managing ideological work and list it as their primary responsibility. The Party's propaganda department should strengthen the comprehensive research on ideological trends at various periods, strengthen theoretical propaganda, education of party members, and propaganda on major domestic and international political events. All grassroots organizations of the Party must strengthen regular Party class education. All senior and middle-level cadres of the Party should study dialectical materialism this year.

    使广大人民分清是非界限和敌我界限，进一步密切党和群众的联系，调动一切积极因素克服一切消极因素，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，推动今年增产节约运动和农业丰产运动的开展。
    据新华社太原24日电　中共山西省委员会23日决定从现在起到今年6月底，在全省范围内普遍开展一次社会主义思想的宣传运动。
    中共山西省委23日作出的“关于加强党的思想工作的决定”中说，开展这次宣传运动的目的，是要使广大人民群众分清是非界限和敌我界限，进一步密切党与人民群众的联系，调动一切积极因素克服一切消极因素，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，推动今年增产节约运动和农业丰产运动的开展。
    这个决定详细地分析了目前全省各阶层人民和党内的思想动向，并且着重分析了当前一切错误思想的表现和产生错误思想的根源，把错误思想看作是一种客观存在的和正确思想相对立的社会现象，不要把它掩盖起来，应该采取耐心地向人民群众进行说服教育的办法来加以解决。
    这次宣传运动将要根据“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文的精神，集中地向人民群众进行关于无产阶级国际主义的教育，苏联革命和建设的基本经验的教育，关于发展生产和改善生活、个人与集体、民主与集中、民主与专政、党与群众之间的正确关系的教育。通过开展讨论、领导干部作报告等办法，肯定正确的思想，批判错误的思想。并且还要在讨论中虚心地接受各种正确的要求和批评意见。
    为了使这次宣传运动健康地展开，决定要求各级党委的书记和各系统的主要领导人员亲自动手，调查研究各阶层人民的思想动向，直接指导这一运动的开展。同时，在运动中要注意充分发挥青年团的助手作用，对青年学生要继续进行阶级教育、劳动教育和革命传统教育，以便克服他们不愿参加劳动生产特别是不愿到农村去从事生产或工作的不良倾向。
    这个决定还要求各级党组织把党的政治思想工作经常化、制度化。党委的各个工作部门，都要分工管理思想工作，而且应该把它列为首要职责。党的宣传部门要加强对各个时期的思想动向的综合研究，加强理论宣传、党员教育和国内外重大时事政治问题的宣传。党的一切基层组织都必须加强经常的党课教育工作。所有党的高级干部和中级干部，今年都要学习辩证唯物主义。
