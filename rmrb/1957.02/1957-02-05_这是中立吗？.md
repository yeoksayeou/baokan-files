A Strange “Reason”

    The Austrian government has come up with a strange "reason" to prohibit the World Peace Council Secretariat from continuing its activities in Austria. The Austrian Ministry of the Interior issued a ban on February 1, saying that the activities of the World Peace Council "do not conform to the principle of maintaining peaceful relations between Austria and other countries." On February 2, the police closed the office building of the World Peace Council Secretariat in Vienna.
    Indeed, according to the Austrian State Treaty signed in May 1955, Austria should be a permanently neutral country, and it has the responsibility to maintain peaceful relations with other countries. However, everyone knows that the sole purpose of all activities of the World Peace Council Secretariat is to defend world peace! Its achievements in promoting world peace and friendly relations between countries are obvious to all. To say that the activities of such an organization dedicated to defending world peace "do not conform to the principle of maintaining peaceful relations between Austria and other countries" is clearly just a far-fetched excuse to cover up an ulterior motive.
    This is not the first time the Austrian government has arbitrarily banned the activities of international organizations in Austria. A year ago, the Austrian government banned the World Federation of Trade Unions from operating in Austria, and sent police to raid the World Federation of Trade Unions' office building and close its headquarters.
    However, at the same time, people have seen that some organizations and institutions that are truly engaged in anti-peace activities are freely operating in Austria, including radio stations that engage in anti-Soviet and anti-communist clamoring all day long, and foreign espionage agencies that carry out subversive activities against socialist countries. During the Hungarian incident, a large number of fascist bandits, fully armed, passed through Austria into Hungary. It cannot be said that these activities are in line with Austria's peaceful relations with socialist countries. However, not only have they not been interfered with by the Austrian government, but they have instead received various conveniences.
    Austrian Chancellor Raab once said: "Austria's desire for neutrality is in line with the profound wishes of the vast majority of our people." This is true. The Austrian government's policy of neutrality, which does not participate in major power blocs, is not only in line with Austria's own national interests, but also in line with the interests of European peace. However, practices such as banning the World Peace Council from operating in Austria while providing favorable conditions for organizations engaged in subversive activities against socialist countries are clearly inconsistent with the true desire for neutrality. This is neither in line with Austria's national interests nor with the interests of European peace.

### 这是中立吗？

    这是中立吗？
    奥地利政府想了一个奇怪的“理由”来禁止世界和平理事会书记处在奥地利境内继续活动。奥地利内政部在2月1日发布禁令说：世界和平理事会的活动“不符合奥地利和其他各国保持和平关系的原则”。2月2日，警察就封闭了在维也纳的世界和平理事会书记处的办公大厦。
    的确，根据1955年5月签订的奥地利国家条约，奥地利应当成为一个永久中立的国家，它有责任同其他国家保持和平的关系。但是，谁都知道，世界和平理事会书记处的全部活动的目的只有一个：保卫世界和平！它在促进世界和平事业和各国间友好关系方面的成就是有目共睹的。把这样一个致力于保卫世界和平的组织的活动说成“不符合奥地利和其他各国保持和平关系的原则”，显然只是强词夺理的借口，用来掩盖一种不可告人的目的。
    奥地利政府这样蛮横地禁止国际组织在奥地利的活动已经不是第一次了。一年以前，奥地利政府曾经禁止世界工联在奥地利境内活动，并且派遣警察袭击世界工联的办公楼，封闭世界工联的会址。
    但是，人们同时却看到有一些真正进行反和平勾当的组织和机构在奥地利境内自由地活动着，其中有终日从事反苏反共叫嚣的广播电台，有对社会主义国家进行颠覆活动的外国间谍机关。在匈牙利事件中，大批的法西斯匪徒全副武装地经过奥地利进入匈牙利。决不能说，这些活动符合于奥地利同社会主义国家间的和平关系。但是它们不但丝毫没有受到奥地利政府的干涉，却反而得到了各种方便。
    奥地利总理拉布曾经说过：“奥地利中立的意愿符合于我国绝大多数人民的深厚愿望。”这是不错的。奥地利政府执行不参加大国集团的中立政策，不仅符合于奥地利本身的民族利益，也符合于欧洲和平的利益。但是，像禁止世界和平理事会在奥境活动而为对社会主义国家进行颠复活动的组织提供方便条件这类做法，同真正的中立意愿是显然不相称的。这既不符合奥地利的民族利益，也不符合欧洲和平的利益。
