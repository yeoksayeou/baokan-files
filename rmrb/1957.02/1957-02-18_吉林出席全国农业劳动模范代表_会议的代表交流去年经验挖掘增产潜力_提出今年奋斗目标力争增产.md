Changchun Dispatch: The thirty delegates from Jilin Province attending the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Models, in order to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year and to complete and overfulfill the province's task of producing six million tons of grain this year, have jointly proposed to all agricultural cooperatives, state farms, livestock farms, agricultural machinery tractor stations, and agricultural science and technology workers in the province, before going to Beijing, to launch a pre-sowing and spring plowing production competition between neighboring cooperatives, between teams within cooperatives, between farms and stations, and between agricultural science and technology work units or personnel.

When discussing the goal of striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, the agricultural labor model representatives tried every means to explore the potential for increased production and widely exchanged high-yield experiences from last year. Yue Caihui, the representative of the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County, introduced the experience of producing 10,798.3 catties of soybeans per hectare on 5.8 hectares of land. Cao Mingzhe (Korean nationality), the representative of the Tuanjie Cooperative in Liuhe County, introduced high-yield experiences such as "triangular rice transplanting" and "three-layer fertilization."

On the basis of summarizing past agricultural production increase experiences, they specifically discussed and proposed the goals for striving for a bumper harvest this year and various specific guarantees. They proposed: With a large increase in grain production as the main focus, develop cash crops according to national plans, develop animal husbandry and sideline occupations, breed and protect draught animals, and comprehensively develop the rural economy. In terms of agricultural production, on the basis of "three fixed" yields, increase production by five dou (250 catties) of grain per hectare. In order to achieve this plan, they proposed basic measures such as building water conservancy projects, increasing the application of manure fertilizer, selecting fine seeds, preventing disasters, and planting early at the right time, and promoted agricultural production increase experiences and improved agricultural technology in accordance with local conditions, and made preparations for spring plowing in advance.

In order to ensure that agricultural production has sufficient animal power, the proposal also emphasized the need to vigorously protect and breed draught animals, with 80% to 90% of female animals being pregnant and a survival rate of over 90%; and improve livestock feeding management to ensure they are not thin or die.

In terms of developing sideline production, it was proposed that there should be monthly income and seasonal dividends; and vigorously develop pig farming.

The proposal also put forward specific measures such as conscientiously implementing the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, and improving the management of agricultural cooperatives.

    吉林出席全国农业劳动模范代表
    会议的代表交流去年经验挖掘增产潜力
    提出今年奋斗目标力争增产
    本报长春17日电　吉林省出席全国农业劳动模范代表会议的三十名代表，为了争取今年农业生产的大丰收，完成和超额完成今年全省生产六百万吨粮食的任务，在到北京以前向全省农业社、国营农场、牧畜场、农业机器拖拉机站、农业科学技术工作者，联名提出在邻近的社与社之间，社内队与队之间，场与场、站与站之间，农业科学技术工作单位或工作人员之间开展备耕和春耕生产竞赛的倡议。
    各位农业劳动模范代表在讨论争取今年农业生产大丰收的时候，千方百计地挖掘了增产潜在力量，广泛交流了去年的高产经验。前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县黎明农业社的代表岳彩辉，介绍了在五公顷八亩地上每公顷产大豆一万零七百九十八斤三两的经验。柳河县团结社的代表曹明哲（朝鲜族），介绍了水稻“三角插秧”、“三层施肥”等高产经验。
    在总结过去的农业增产经验的基础上，他们具体地讨论并提出了争取今年大丰收的奋斗目标和各项具体保证条件。他们提出：以大量增产粮食为主，按国家计划发展经济作物，发展畜牧业、副业，繁殖和保护耕畜，全面发展农村经济。在农业生产方面，要在“三定”产量的基础上，每公顷增产五斗粮食（二百五十斤）。为实现这个计划，提出了兴修水利、增施粪肥、精选良种、防止灾害、适时早种等基本措施，并因地制宜推广农业增产经验，改良农业技术，提前做好春耕准备工作。
    为保证农业生产有足够的畜力，倡议中还强调要大力保护和繁殖耕畜，母畜要有80％—90％怀胎，成活率达到90％以上；并改善牲畜饲养管理，保证不瘦弱、不死亡。
    在开展副业生产方面，提出了：月月有收入，季季能分红；并大力发展养猪事业。
    在倡议中还提出了切实贯彻执行勤俭办社和民主办社的方针、改善农业社经营管理等项具体措施。
