Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: TASS, London, February 23rd: Belfrage, former editor of the American weekly "National Guardian," has published a book in London exposing the inside story of the political persecution of progressive people in the United States by the American ruling groups.

Belfrage is a well-known journalist who lived in the United States for a long time and served as the editor of the progressive weekly "National Guardian" for many years. He was arrested and imprisoned by the American authorities in May 1955, and expelled from the United States in August of the same year. He now lives in Britain.

Belfrage's book is titled "The Frightened Giant." In it, he reveals the real reason why the weekly he edited was persecuted by the U.S. government. He wrote, "I am not a Communist, and the 'National Guardian' is not a Communist Party publication. But this situation made the American authorities even more eager to suffocate us. Because the political stance reflected by the 'National Guardian' is the stance that Washington wants to prohibit from continuing to exist in order to save its main propaganda line from bankruptcy. In recent decades, the government has spent millions of dollars to isolate the Communist Party, primarily by using 'evidence' that the Communist Party acts 'on Moscow's orders' to intimidate all progressive people."

Belfrage recounted many occasions where he personally encountered progressive people being intimidated by various insulting "investigations" and means. Belfrage pointed out that professional informants employed by the government play a significant role in these "investigations," earning twenty-five U.S. dollars per person per day for fabricated defamatory statements.

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: New York News: U.S. Federal Court Judge Harold Medina, in a speech in New York on the 22nd, accused the United States of currently preparing to launch an "open attack" on a fundamental freedom enshrined in the U.S. Constitution - "the right of a person to refuse to say anything that might incriminate himself."

Medina said that many freedoms in the United States are now in "serious danger" of being "diluted, curtailed, reduced, or even removed by constitutional amendment."

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: New York News: An article by journalist Stan Opotowsky recently published in the "New York Post" pointed out that the White Citizens' Councils, organizations of southern racists in the United States, often use violence and economic threats to persecute those sympathetic to the Black movement.

He wrote: Hazel Brannon Smith was almost bankrupt because of publishing opinions in a weekly newspaper in Lexington, Mississippi. She attacked the local police chief for shooting a Black man for no reason. The police chief sued her for defamation, and a court controlled by the White Citizens' Council awarded him $10,000 in damages, and even more viciously, Smith's husband was dismissed from his position as director of a public hospital.

The reporter also pointed out that many pastors and staff members in Southern Methodist and Baptist churches have been dismissed from their positions for "offending" or arousing the "suspicion" of the White Citizens' Councils.

    在“自由”幕布后的美国魔影
    统治集团制造伪证编造罪名陷害进步人士
    南方种族主义分子迫害同情黑人运动的人
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社伦敦23日讯：前美国“国民前卫”周刊编辑贝尔弗雷特在伦敦出版了一本书，揭露美国统治集团对在美国的进步人士的政治迫害内幕。
    贝尔弗雷特是著名的记者，曾长期居住美国，担任进步的“国民前卫”周刊编辑多年。1955年5月他被美国当局逮捕入狱，同年8月被逐出美国，现在住在英国。
    贝尔弗雷特的书名是“受惊的巨人”，他在书里揭穿了他所编的周刊受到美国政府迫害的真实原因。他写道，“我不是共产党员，‘国民前卫’也不是共产党的机关刊物。但是这种情况使美国当局更厉害地想窒息我们。因为‘国民前卫’所反映的政治立场，是华盛顿为了挽救自己的主要宣传路线免于破产而想禁止它继续存在的立场。近几十年来政府曾花了数百万美元来孤立共产党，其方法首先是利用共产党‘按照莫斯科的命令’行事的‘证据’，恐吓一切进步人士。”
    贝尔弗雷特叙述了他亲自碰到的许多利用各种侮辱人的“调查”和手段恐吓进步人士的场合。贝尔弗雷特指出，政府雇用的职业告发者在这类“调查”中起着显著作用，他们凭着捏造的诽谤性的口供，每天每个人可以赚到二十五元美金。
    据新华社25日讯　纽约消息：美国联邦法院法官哈罗德·麦迪纳22日在纽约发表的一篇演说中指责美国目前正在准备对美国宪法上规定的一种基本自由——“一个人拒绝说出任何可能使自己有罪的话的权利”，展开“公开进攻”。
    麦迪纳说，美国的许多自由现在处在“被冲淡、削减、减少或者甚至因修正宪法而被去除的”“严重危险中”。
    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”最近发表的记者斯坦·欧普陶斯基的一篇文章指出，美国南方种族主义分子的组织——白人公民委员会经常用暴力威胁和经济威胁来迫害同情黑人运动的人。
    他写道：赫泽尔·布伦农·史密斯由于在密苏里州列克星敦的周报发表意见而几几乎破产。她抨击地方警察局长无缘无故地枪击一个黑人。这个警察局长控告她诽谤，而一个由白人公民委员会控制的法院判给他一万美元的赔偿，并且更毒辣的是，史密斯的丈夫因此被解除了公立医院院长的职位。
    这个记者还指出，南部监理教会和浸礼教会中的许多牧师和工作人员由于“触怒了”白人公民委员会或者引起了白人公民委员会的“疑心”，而被解除了职务。
