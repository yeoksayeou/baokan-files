Xinhua News Agency dispatch: "Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 15th stating that the Korean people hope that Western countries will accept the Soviet government's February 11th note on the Middle East issue and the proposals made by Shepilov in his foreign policy report. The Korean people fully support the Soviet Union's consistent position on the Middle East.

The editorial said that if Western countries ignore the Soviet Union's proposals, all fair-minded public opinion around the world will brand Western countries as enemies of peace. If the American imperialists do not learn from the disastrous defeat suffered by Britain and France in Egypt and stubbornly pursue their "Eisenhower Doctrine," then they will inevitably reap what they sow.

Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: Newspapers in the People's Democratic Countries of Eastern Europe have successively published articles these past two days commenting on the report by Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting on "The International Situation and Issues of Soviet Foreign Policy."

Poland's "People's Tribune," "Warsaw Life," "Voice of Labor," "Free Fighter," and other central Polish newspapers all published detailed summaries of Shepilov's report. "Warsaw Life" emphasized in its headline that the socialist camp has been and will always be the main bulwark of peace and security for all peoples.

An editorial in Czechoslovakia's "Red Right" stated that the Soviet Union has once again demonstrated to the world public its clear policy of easing international tensions, and has once again expressed its willingness to coexist peacefully with all countries. This is demonstrated by Bulganin's letter to German Federal Republic Chancellor Adenauer, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov's report at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting, and the Soviet government's notes to the United States, Britain, and France to ensure peace in the Middle East. The newspaper said that Shepilov's report and the Soviet notes to the three major Western powers put forward concrete proposals, which, if the Western countries are sincere, would become the basis for resolving important international issues.

An editorial in Romania's "Spark" pointed out that Shepilov's report includes a broad program that puts forward new steps and proposals for ensuring the easing of international tensions. The Romanian people are aware of the great strength of the socialist camp's unity, and the invincible nature of the idea of peace and friendship among all peoples. They are determined to make every effort to contribute to the cause of defending peace and international security.

An editorial in Bulgaria's "Workers' Affairs" wrote that Shepilov's report and the discussions surrounding it once again demonstrated the unwavering peace-loving policy of the Soviet state. Running through the entire report is the Soviet Union's determination to do everything possible to prevent a third world war. The Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting once again powerfully demonstrated the strength and unity of the Soviet Union, the growing friendship between the world's first socialist country and all countries in the socialist camp, its peace-loving foreign policy, and its confidence in the victory of the great cause of communist construction.

Albania's "Voice of the People" and "Unity" both published Shepilov's report and editorials. The "Unity" editorial said that Shepilov's report is the powerful voice of communist builders, expressing the great and unwavering will to consolidate peace. The editorial pointed out that the stronger the socialist camp, the more secure the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of each socialist country. The Albanian people fully support all Soviet proposals.

    苏联建议是缓和国际紧张局势的明确方针
    人民民主国家报纸支持苏联的各项建议
    据新华社讯　“民主朝鲜报”15日发表社论说，朝鲜人民希望西方国家接受苏联政府2月11日关于中近东问题的照会和谢皮洛夫在外交报告中所提出的建议。朝鲜人民完全支持苏联对中近东的一贯立场。
    社论说，假如西方国家对苏联的建议置之不理，全世界一切公正的舆论将给西方国家打上一个烙印——和平的敌人。假如美帝国主义者不吸取英法在埃及所遭受的惨败的教训，而硬干他的一套“艾森豪威尔主义”的话，那么，它将难免要自食其果。
    新华社15日讯　东欧人民民主国家的报纸这两天相继发表文章，评论苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上作的关于“国际局势和苏联外交政策问题”的报告。
    波兰的“人民论坛报”、“华沙生活报”、“劳动之声报”、“自由战士报”和波兰其他一些中央报纸都刊载了谢皮洛夫的报告的详细摘要。“华沙生活报”在标题中强调指出，社会主义阵营过去和今后始终是各国人民和平和安全的主要堡垒。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”的社论说，苏联在世界公众面前重新表明了缓和国际紧张局势的明确方针，再一次表示了自己同一切国家和平共处的意愿。布尔加宁致德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳的信、苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告、以及苏联政府为保障中近东和平给美英法三国的照会都表现了这一点。这家报纸说，在谢皮洛夫的报告和苏联致西方三大国的照会中提出了具体建议，只要西方国家有真心诚意，这些建议就会成为解决重要国际问题的基础。
    罗马尼亚的“火花报”的社论指出，谢皮洛夫的报告包括了一个广泛的纲领，这个纲领提出了保证国际紧张局势和缓的新步骤和建议。罗马尼亚人民意识到社会主义阵营团结的伟大力量，意识到和平和各国人民友谊的思想不可战胜，他们决心全力对保卫和平和国际安全的事业作出贡献。
    保加利亚的“工人事业报”在社论中写道，谢皮洛夫的报告和就这个报告展开的讨论再一次表明了苏维埃国家的不可动摇的爱好和平的政策。贯穿着整个报告的是：苏联决心尽一切可能来防止第三次世界大战。苏联最高苏维埃会议再一次有力地显示了苏联的力量和团结，显示了世界上第一个社会主义国家同社会主义阵营所有国家的日益发展的友谊，它的爱好和平的外交政策，它对伟大的共产主义建设事业的胜利的信心。
    阿尔巴尼亚的“人民之声报”和“团结报”都刊登了谢皮洛夫的报告，并且发表了社论。“团结报”的社论说，谢皮洛夫的报告是共产主义建设者的强有力的声音，它表达了巩固和平的伟大的不可动摇的意志。社论指出，社会主义阵营愈是坚强，各个社会主义国家的自由独立和主权也就更加牢靠。阿尔巴尼亚人民完全支持苏联的各项建议。
