The circular then stated: In order to strengthen the production and construction of the coal industry, all coal mine workers should continue to consolidate and promote this high degree of political enthusiasm and spirit of actively overcoming difficulties in production. In future production, we should further implement the policy of safe production, strengthen the maintenance and repair of various equipment, do a good job in production preparation, maintain the connection between tunneling, stripping, and mining, and make persistent efforts to continue to deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to over fulfill the 1957 planned tasks.

The text of the telegram is as follows:

To the National Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China and all coal mine worker comrades:

When people across the country were celebrating the Spring Festival, you actively responded to the State Council's call for increased coal production during the Spring Festival holiday, enthusiastically participated in Spring Festival production, and produced 450,000 tons of coal for the country, alleviating the tight coal supply situation in the first quarter. Workers' families also actively carried out much work to ensure increased coal production during the Spring Festival. Your high degree of patriotism and hard work fully demonstrate the spirit of the working class as masters of the country. We extend our sincere respect and greetings to you.

Due to the rapid development of our country's socialist industrial construction and the increasing improvement of people's lives, the situation of coal supply falling short of demand is still one of the major difficulties facing the country. It is hoped that you will continue to work hard on this basis of victory, deeply carry out the advanced producer movement, do a good job in safe production, and strive to over fulfill the 1957 production tasks, producing more coal for the country.

The completion of your Spring Festival coal production increase task is inseparable from the active cooperation and close coordination of workers in railway transportation, the electricity industry, the forestry industry, and commercial departments. It is hoped that you will continue to strengthen cooperation and work closely with workers in these departments to strive for the successful completion of the country's production increase and economy drive!
