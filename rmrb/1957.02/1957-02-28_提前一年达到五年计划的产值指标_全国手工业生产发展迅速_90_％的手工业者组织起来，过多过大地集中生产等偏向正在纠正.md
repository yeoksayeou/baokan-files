Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: The handicraft production cooperatives (groups) across the country have achieved the production value target for the final year of the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.

According to recent preliminary statistics from the Central Handicraft Administration, the total production value of more than 100,040 handicraft production cooperatives, supply and marketing production cooperatives, and production groups nationwide in 1956 exceeded the planned target for 1957 in the first Five-Year Plan by more than 60%. The average production value of more than 4.7 million members of cooperatives (groups) in 1956 increased by 23% compared to the average production value of cooperative (group) members in 1955.

In 1956, the number of organized handicraft workers nationwide increased from 29.2% in the previous year to about 90%. After the vast number of handicraft workers were organized, they rapidly developed production, supplying a large number of products to basic construction and large-scale industry, to farmers and urban residents, and for export. In the first half of last year, the iron and wooden farm tools manufactured by handicraft cooperatives (groups) averaged more than one piece per farming household. Such a large-scale production of farm tools by handicrafts had not occurred in any previous year. The Fuxian Ceramics Cooperative in Liaoning Province produced a total of more than 320 kilometers of ceramic pipes last year, supplying them to basic construction units as substitutes for steel and cement pipes. Handicraft cooperatives in Zunyi City, Guizhou, and Luoyang City, Henan, manufactured a large number of tools, raincoats, work clothes, gloves, safety helmets, and other supplies for the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway and the Sanmenxia construction site, respectively. Handicraft cooperatives in Beijing in industries such as clothing, leather shoes, wooden furniture, and confectionery, produced nearly twice as many products last year as in the previous year to supply the people of the capital. The export volume of Hunan Province’s Xiang embroidery, bamboo carvings, and other handicrafts last year was sixteen times higher than in 1955. The products of handicraft cooperatives not only increased in quantity compared to the past, but the quality generally improved, and the varieties and designs were also improved. The percentage of qualified products from handicraft cooperatives in Tianjin generally reached more than 90%. Last year, Shanghai successfully trial-produced and mass-produced more than 3,000 new handicraft products. Provinces and cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, and Liaoning also added more than 2,000 new handicraft products.

Last year, handicraft cooperatives in many industries made extensive use of waste materials and substitutes, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. In Beijing, one-quarter of the handicraft cooperatives produced all or most of their products using waste products and scrap materials. In Tianjin, more than twenty industries with a total of more than 140 cooperatives regularly used waste materials as raw materials, creating a value of 50 million yuan last year. Handicraft cooperatives not only obtained waste materials from state-owned commercial enterprises and factories, but also sent people to collect them from the public. The waste steel acquired by handicraft cooperatives in Jiangsu Province last year basically met the needs of iron production cooperatives throughout the province.

Due to insufficient understanding of the inherent characteristics of handicraft production, after the large-scale development of handicraft cooperatives last year, the trend of excessive and overly centralized production, accepting large orders and not taking on small, scattered jobs, became widespread in various places. There were also many shortcomings in the management system. As a result, many industries squeezed out the manufacturing of small, scattered jobs and repair services, causing inconvenience to consumers. Because the products of some industries could not meet the demand, the product inspection system was not sound, and the wage system was unreasonable, leading to a tendency for cooperative members to pursue quantity and neglect quality. The handicraft management departments in various places made efforts to correct these shortcomings in the second half of last year. The负责人of the Central Handicraft Administration and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative Federation believe that this year, under the policy of carrying out increased production and conservation, doing a good job in production, and consolidating and improving existing cooperatives (groups), it is necessary to continue to adjust the organizational form, appropriately decentralize cooperatives that are too concentrated and too large, restore some of the fine traditions that were convenient for consumers in the past, improve business management according to the characteristics of handicrafts, and continue to correct the overly high, overly low, and egalitarian tendencies in the wage system of some cooperatives (groups).

### 提前一年达到五年计划的产值指标  全国手工业生产发展迅速  90％的手工业者组织起来，过多过大地集中生产等偏向正在纠正

    提前一年达到五年计划的产值指标
    全国手工业生产发展迅速
    90％的手工业者组织起来，过多过大地集中生产等偏向正在纠正
    新华社27日讯　全国手工业生产合作社（组）第一个五年计划最后一年的产值指标已经提前一年实现。
    据中央手工业管理局最近的初步统计，全国十万零四千多个手工业生产合作社、供销生产社和生产小组1956年的生产总值比第一个五年计划中1957年计划指标多60％以上。四百七十多万个社（组）员1956年的平均产值，比1955年社（组）员平均产值增长23％。
    1956年全国手工业者中组织起来的人数由前一年的29.2％增加到90％左右。广大手工业者组织起来以后，迅速发展了生产，以大批产品供给了基本建设和大工业，供给了农民和城市居民以及提供出口。去年上半年手工业社（组）制造的铁木农具，平均每家农户可以得到一件以上。手工业这样大量地生产农具是过去任何一年都没有的。辽宁省复县陶瓷社去年生产了共长三百二十多公里的陶瓷管，供给基本建设单位代替钢管和水泥管使用。贵州遵义市和河南洛阳市的手工业社，分别为川黔铁路和三门峡工地制造了大批工具和雨衣、工作服、手套、安全帽等用品。北京市服装、皮鞋、木器家具、糖果糕点等行业的手工业社，去年都生产了比前一年将近多一倍的产品供应首都人民。湖南省湘绣、竹刻等手工艺品去年的出口量比1955年多十六倍。手工业社的产品不仅数量比过去增加，质量一般也有提高，花色品种也有改进。天津市手工业社的产品正品率一般达到了90％以上。上海市去年试制成功并已成批生产的手工业新产品有三千多种。北京、天津、江苏、云南、福建、湖南、湖北、辽宁等省、市手工业新增加的产品也在二千种以上。
    不少行业的手工业合作社去年大量地利用废料和代用品，克服了原料不足的困难。北京市有四分之一的手工业社的全部或大部分产品是用废品废料制成的。天津市经常用废料作原料的有二十多个行业共一百四十多个合作社，去年利用废料创造的价值达五千万元。手工业合作社不仅从国营商业、工厂获得废料，而且派人到民间收购。江苏省手工业社去年收购的废钢铁基本上满足了全省铁业生产合作社的需要。
    由于对手工业生产的固有特点认识不足，去年在手工业合作社大量发展以后，各地曾经普遍地发生过多过大地集中生产、承接大批订货不接零星小活等偏向，管理制度上也存在许多缺点，结果许多行业把制造零星小活和修理业务挤掉了，使消费者感到不便。有些行业因为产品供不应求，产品检验制度不健全以及工资制度不合理，引起社员追求产量忽略质量的偏向。对于这些缺点，各地手工业管理部门去年下半年曾经努力纠正。中央手工业管理局和全国手工业合作总社筹委会的负责人认为，今年在开展增产节约，搞好生产，巩固提高现有社（组）的方针下，还要继续调整组织形式，把集中过多过大的社适当加以分散，恢复过去一些便利消费者的优良传统，并且根据手工业的特点改善经营管理，部分社（组）的工资制度中的偏高偏低和平均主义偏向也要继续纠正。
