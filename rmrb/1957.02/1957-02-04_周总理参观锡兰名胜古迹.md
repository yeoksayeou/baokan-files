Xinhua News Agency, Polonnaruwa, 3rd – Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long ascended the Sigiriya rock fortress, a famous historical site in Ceylon, on the morning of February 2nd, to visit the ruins of the palace built by an ancient king in the fifth century on the mountain's flat summit. They thus became the first foreign dignitaries to ascend the difficult-to-climb Sigiriya summit.

That morning, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long received a warm farewell from the people of Kandy. Afterwards, after visiting the immigration project, they went to Sigiriya.

Sigiriya is a large rock mountain, four thousand feet high, which rises steeply from the vast plain. In the fifth century, the emperor built solid and winding steps along the mountain, and built a palace on the top of the mountain. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long gradually climbed up, and later climbed up the spiral staircase to admire the moving portraits of twenty-one women painted on the stone wall 1,500 years ago. Not far from there, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long climbed dangerously to the top of the mountain along the hanging, winding iron ladder and a series of shallow footholds chiseled into the cliff. While resting after this unusual climb, they sucked sweet juice from holes chiseled out of fresh, golden coconuts.

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long traveled from Sigiriya to Polonnaruwa, which is famous as the largest city in Ceylon in the Middle Ages. When they arrived at 1:00 pm, they were warmly welcomed by the residents of the city. In this city, they saw a lake, twenty miles in radius, built in the fourth century, a plan to redevelop the irrigation system originally built in the twelfth century, some immigration plans in the area, and visited some of the historical sites for which the city is famous.

When Premier Zhou Enlai returned to his residence after the visit, a bearded villager and his son gave several bundles of freshly ripened rice to the Chinese guests. Premier Zhou talked to him about the agricultural situation and his life.

On this day, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long passed through vast rubber plantations, tea plantations, and coconut plantations, as well as high mountains with unexploited forests. In every town and village that the Chinese guests passed through, many people gathered by the roadside to welcome them.

    周总理参观锡兰名胜古迹
    新华社波隆纳鲁瓦3日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理2日上午登上锡兰的名胜锡吉里亚石山，参观了山巅平顶上五世纪时古代帝王建造的宫殿的遗址。这样，他们就成为首次登上难以攀登的锡吉里亚山巅的外国贵宾。
    当天清晨，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理曾经在康提受到当地人民的热烈欢送。接着，在参观移民计划之后，就到锡吉里亚。
    锡吉里亚是四千英尺高的大石山，它险峻地突起在广阔的平原上。五世纪时的帝王沿山建造了坚固的迂回曲折的阶梯，并且在山顶上建造了宫殿。周恩来总理和贺龙副总理逐步攀登，后来登上螺旋形的阶梯，欣赏了一千五百年前画在石壁上的二十一个妇女的动人的画像。就在离那里不远的地方，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理又沿着悬空的弯弯曲曲的铁扶梯和一连串凿在峭壁上的很浅的踏脚的地方，艰险地攀登到山顶。在这次不寻常的爬山后休息时，他们从金黄色的新鲜椰子壳上凿的洞中吮饮甜汁。
    随后，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理从锡吉里亚乘车前往以中古时代锡兰最大的城市著名的波隆纳鲁瓦。他们在下午一点钟到达时，受到了这个城市居民的热烈欢迎。在这个城市，他们看到了四世纪时修建的方圆达二十英里的湖泊，重新发展原在十二世纪时修建的灌溉体系的计划和这个地区的一些移民计划，并且参观了这个城市因而著名的一些古迹。
    周恩来总理在参观后回到寓所的时候，一位满脸胡须的乡民和他的儿子把好几捆刚成熟的稻子送给了中国客人。周总理同他谈到农业情况和他的生活情况。
    这一天，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理曾经路过广大的橡胶园、茶园和椰子园以及有着未开伐的丛林的高山。在中国客人们经过的每个城镇和村庄里，总有许多人聚集在路旁，他们都向客人表示欢迎。
