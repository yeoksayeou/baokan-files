Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. Recently, an interesting clock appeared in Guangzhou No. 7 Middle School. It can automatically report the school's thirty-eight daily schedules to the entire school using electric bells.

The person who modified this clock was Huang Mingxin, a mathematics teacher at this school. As early as a year ago, he thought about using machinery to automatically report the schedule. He installed a contact plate and other parts inside the clock, so that the time the electric key is energized is the same as the schedule time, and then connected the power supply to the electric bell through a transformer. In this way, every time the clock points to the time of class or dismissal, the electric bells throughout the school will ring. If the schedule changes, it can be adjusted slightly, and it can report the time to people according to the new schedule system. The school no longer needs to use someone to ring the bell. Huang Mingxin spent only more than 20 yuan to modify this clock.

    自动报时钟
    新华社广州27日电　广州市第七中学最近出现了一架有趣的时钟，它能自动将学校一昼夜内三十八次作息时间用电铃报告给全校。
    改装这架时钟的是这个学校的数学教师黄铭信。早在一年以前，他就想到用机械来自动报告作息时间。他在时钟内部装上接电板和其他一些零件，使电键通电的时间和作息时间相同，再将电源通过变压器和电铃相接。这样，每当时钟指着上课或下课的时间时，全校的电铃便都响起来。如果作息时间改变，只要稍加调整，它又可按新的作息制度为人们报告时刻。这个学校现在已不必使用打铃的人了。黄铭信改装这个时钟总共才用了二十多元。
