    New Uses for Seashells
    (Report from this newspaper) Seashells, once considered useless waste, have now become a source of side income for fishermen in Lvsigang.

      Lvsigang is located in the northern part of Lvsi Town, Qidong County, Jiangsu Province. It is rich in fish, shrimp, and jellyfish. The entire port is covered with seashells accumulated over the years. These were previously regarded as waste, but now they can be used in industry to make clam oil, seashell powder, and putty for fishing boats. They can also be used for paving roads.

      Since the beginning of winter, male and female members of nearby fishing cooperatives have been gathering seashells in groups of three or five, braving the cold wind every day. In the past two months, the entire port has collected nearly 2.6 million catties of seashells. In addition to making seashell powder for their own use, the fishing cooperatives also transport seashells to Ningbo, Zhejiang, and other places for sale. As of now, the Lvsi Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased seashells worth more than 19,000 yuan. (Liu Tianfu)

    贝壳的新用途
    本报讯　一向被人称为废物的贝壳，现在成为吕四港渔民的一项副业收入了。
      吕四港位于江苏省启东县吕四镇北部。这里盛产鱼、虾和海蜇。全港的周围铺满了历年来积累的贝壳，过去一向被人们看成废物，现在在工业上可以用它做蛤蜊油，制贝粉，以及渔船上用的油灰。还可以用它来铺路。
      入冬以来，附近渔业社的男女社员们，每天都三五成群地冒着阵阵的冷风来拾贝壳。两个月来，全港拾贝壳将近二百六十万斤。各渔业社除自制贝粉外，还把贝壳运往浙江宁波等地出售，吕四镇供销合作社到目前止，已收购了价值一万九千多元的贝壳。　（刘天福）
