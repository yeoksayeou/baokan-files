Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd – The Chinese People's Liberation Army Armored Corps Activists' Representative Conference concluded this afternoon. At the meeting, three hundred and twenty-three activist representatives and representatives of ninety-six advanced units were rewarded.

Among the rewarded activist representatives, twenty-one were outstanding soldiers who enlisted last year. Among them were: tank gunner Guo Qingjie, who achieved excellent results in ten out of ten shots; anti-aircraft observer Wang Shouliang, who completed two years of study in three and a half months; and soldier Luo Lahuang, who created a "tank track puller" that enabled one person to do the work of five or six people, etc.

Tank driver Fu Fulu, who had only been enlisted for two years, introduced his deeds at the meeting. At an astonishing speed, he rose from a third-class technical level tank driver to second-class and then first-class technical levels in a short period. In January of this year, he was promoted to tank driving technician. Fu Fulu only studied for three years and often encountered difficulties in learning technology. Once, when he encountered a difficult problem, he asked five people in succession until he thoroughly understood it from all angles. His learning process shows that as long as every soldier studies diligently, practices hard, and researches meticulously, they can master modern weapons and complex scientific military technology.

Three soldiers of Yi, Zhuang, and Korean ethnicities were also rewarded.

During the conference, nineteen activists and representatives of advanced units gave reports on their typical deeds. General Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, also attended the meeting and gave instructions.

    装甲兵积极分子代表会议闭幕
    新华社23日讯　中国人民解放军装甲兵积极分子代表会议在今天下午闭幕。会上，奖励了三百二十三名积极分子代表和九十六个先进单位的代表。
    受到奖励的积极分子代表中，有二十一名是去年入伍的优秀战士。其中有：十次射击十次获得优秀成绩的坦克炮长郭清杰，三个半月完成二年学习任务的对空观察兵王守良，创造了一个人能够代替五、六个人劳动的“坦克履带拉力机”的战士罗腊晃等。
    入伍才二年的坦克驾驶手傅福禄，在会上介绍了自己的事迹。他以惊人的速度，短时间内从三等技术水平的坦克驾驶员，连续上升到二等、一等技术水平。今年1月，又上升为坦克驾驶技师。傅福禄只读过三年书，在学习技术中时常遇到困难。有一次遇到一个很难解决的问题，他先后问过五个人，直到从各方面透彻弄懂为止。他的学习过程表明，只要勤学苦练、精心钻研，每个战士都能精通现代化的手中武器，掌握复杂的科学军事技术。
    有三名彝族、僮族、朝鲜族的战士也受到了奖励。
    会议期间，有十九个积极分子和先进单位的代表作了典型事迹报告。总政治部副主任甘泗淇上将还到会作了指示。
