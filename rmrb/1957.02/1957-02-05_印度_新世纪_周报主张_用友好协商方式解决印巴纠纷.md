Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 2nd: The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly stated: "The unresolved disputes with Pakistan can only be resolved through friendly consultation." "If other paths are taken, it will fall into the trap of British and American imperialists and their agents."

"New Age" weekly advocates: The Indian government should hold consultations with responsible parties to formulate effective policies to meet current needs; the government should openly oppose those who genuinely incite war in Kashmir and the masterminds of the current threat to India. The weekly warns the people to be wary of all attempts to incite sectarian sentiment on this issue.

The weekly published a cartoon on the front page depicting Eisenhower wearing armor with two spikes on his chest, smiling as he walks towards Nehru. One of the spikes symbolizes military treaties, and the other symbolizes the Security Council's resolution on the Kashmir issue. The caption reads: "The Fatal Embrace."

    印度“新世纪”周报主张
    用友好协商方式解决印巴纠纷
    据新华社新德里2日电　最近一期“新世纪”周报说：“同巴基斯坦的没有解决的纠纷只有通过友好协商的方式才能得到解决。”“如果采取别的道路，就会中了英美帝国主义者及其代理人的计。”
    “新世纪”周报主张：印度政府同各负责的党派举行协商来拟订有力的政策，以满足当前的需要；政府应该公开表示反对真正煽动克什米尔战争的人和目前对印度的威胁的主使人。周报警告人民，要提防一切在这个问题上煽动教派情绪的企图。
    这家周报在首页刊载了一幅漫画，画的是艾森豪威尔身穿盔甲，胸口有两只尖钉，微笑着向尼赫鲁走去。两只尖钉中一只象征军事条约，另一只象征安全理事会的克什米尔问题决议。说明是：“致命的拥抱”。
