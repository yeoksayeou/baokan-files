    Letter of Correction

    The news "Tongxin Cooperative Raises Many Pigs and Saves Feed" published on the third page of the People's Daily on December 15th of last year was adapted from materials I provided to the Party Group of the State Planning Commission. After the news was published, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao investigated and found discrepancies with the facts. The main reason for this error is that I regarded the initial experimental method as an effective method. After discovering that the cooperative raised many pigs and would raise a large number in the future, I asked Wang Yongxiang, the deputy director of sideline production, how to solve the feed problem. When he explained to me that the cooperative had allocated feed land to intercrop high-yield crops, I did not ask whether it was an achievement already obtained or an experiment in progress, and reported it to the leadership as an effective method; as a result, there were discrepancies with the facts. When Wang Yongxiang talked about the Kunshan area being able to raise pigs twice a year, with an average weight of 120 catties per pig, I felt it was very novel, so I vaguely wrote it down; but I did not write about those raised to more than 120 catties. As for the existing number of pigs and the planned number for development this year, there were also some discrepancies between what I wrote and the actual situation; however, it should be stated that the figures I wrote were provided by Chen Zhishan, the cadre stationed in the cooperative, and the deputy director of sideline production in the cooperative, and were not fabricated by myself. Although the reported situation differs from the facts, the achievements of the Tongxin Cooperative in raising pigs are still worthy of affirmation, and their spirit of actively experimenting with new methods in pig raising is also commendable.

    Due to my unserious work attitude and insufficient in-depth work, the above errors were caused. In addition to conducting a self-criticism on this matter, I also apologize to the readers.　Liao Shiguang

    来函更正
    去年12月15日人民日报第三版发表的“同心社养猪多饲料省”的新闻，是根据我提供给国家计划委员会党组的材料改编的。这条新闻发表以后，经大公报记者调查，与事实有出入。造成这个错误的原因，主要是我把开始试行的办法当作行之有效的办法。我发现这个社养猪多、今后养的数量也很大的情况以后，就向副业主任王永祥了解饲料问题如何解决。当他向我说明社里已划出饲料地套种高产作物的时候，我也没有再去问他是已经取得的成效还是正在试验，就当作行之有效的办法向领导上汇报；结果与事实有了出入。王永祥谈到昆山地区可以年养两次猪、平均每头重一百二十斤的时候，我感到很新奇，也就含含糊糊的写上了；而对于包养一百二十斤以上的，却没有写进去。至于现有猪的头数和今年计划发展的头数，我写的同实际情况也有一些出入；不过，应该声明，我写的数字是驻社干部陈之山和社里的副业主任提供的，并不是我自己臆造的。虽然报道的情况与事实有出入，但同心社养猪的成绩还是可以肯定的，他们在养猪中积极实验新办法的精神也是可贵的。
    由于我的工作态度不够严肃、工作不够深入，以致造成了上述错误，我对此事除作了自我检讨以外，并向读者致歉。　廖时光
