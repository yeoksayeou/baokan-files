Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Tianjin Railway Bureau has resumed political classes that had been suspended for over a year.

    The resumption of these political classes is based on a recent plan formulated by the General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the Railway Bureau to strengthen the political education of its employees. The plan stipulates that employees will have two hours of fixed political study time each week. The content of the study includes the status and responsibilities of the working class, the relationship between national construction and the people's livelihood, the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the international situation. This study particularly emphasizes guiding employees to connect with reality, carry out criticism and self-criticism, in order to raise political consciousness and establish communist moral character.

    据新华社讯　天津机务段恢复了已经停办一年多的政治课。
    这次政治课的恢复，是根据中共机务段总支委员会最近制定的加强职工政治学习计划进行的。计划规定，职工每周有两小时固定的政治学习时间，学习的内容包括工人阶级的地位和责任、国家建设和人民生活的关系、个人和集体的关系以及国际形势等。这次学习特别强调要引导职工联系实际，开展批评和自我批评，以提高政治觉悟，树立共产主义的道德品质。
