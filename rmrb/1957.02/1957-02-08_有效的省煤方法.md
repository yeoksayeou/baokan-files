Xinhua News Agency report: Burned furnace ash can be mixed with good coal for combustion. According to a responsible person from the West Fuxin Railway Sub-bureau, this is an effective method for saving coal.

    Within this railway sub-bureau, the Zhangwu Station water supply station was the first to reuse furnace ash. This water supply station screened the furnace ash left over from locomotives and boilers, removing the ash dust and picking out the large chunks of coked material. The remaining thumb-sized pieces of ash were mixed with good coal for burning in the boiler, up to 70% in some cases. This coal-saving method has been promoted to all water supply stations in the sub-bureau. Some stations with smaller water supply needs even burn 100% furnace ash in their boilers. Some water supply stations use furnace ash to ignite and damp down inferior coal.

    The railway sub-bureau has already saved more than 300 tons of raw coal by reusing furnace ash. The sub-bureau has summarized this experience and compiled it into a booklet, hoping to introduce it to major cities.

    有效的省煤方法
    据新华社讯　烧剩的炉灰还可以再混在好煤里燃烧。西阜新铁路分局一位负责人说，这是一种有效的省煤方法。
    在这个铁路分局里，最先使炉灰重燃的是彰武车站给水站。这个给水站把火车头和锅炉烧剩的炉灰，筛除灰末，检去结成焦核的大块，把剩下的小手指头大的煤灰块混在好煤里烧锅炉，最多的时候可以混到70％。这个省煤的办法已经在分局各给水站推广开来。一些给水量不大的站甚至百分之百地用这种炉灰烧锅炉。有的给水站烧劣煤就用炉灰点火和压火。
    这个铁路分局利用炉灰重燃已经节省下三百多吨原煤。分局已经总结这个经验，编成小册子，希望能够介绍给各大城市。
