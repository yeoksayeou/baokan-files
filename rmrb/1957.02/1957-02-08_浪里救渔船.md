　　Saving a Fishing Boat in the Waves	Private Yang Guangming
　　One afternoon at the end of November 1955, our ×× Detachment × Team was anchored in the river. Comrades were chatting and laughing in the cabin. Suddenly, the signalman on duty came into the cabin and reported: "Comrade Captain, the wharf has sent a signal ordering our 526 boat and the deputy command boat to set sail immediately and patrol the sea!"
　　We quickly started the engine and, with the deputy command boat in a single column, faced the force five gale, broke through the waves, and sailed towards the mouth of the Minjiang River.
　　Once out of the mouth of the Minjiang River, the waves became bigger and bigger. The gunboat tossed and turned in the waves, and the waves constantly crashed onto the boat, with the spray hitting our faces like a rainstorm. We had encountered waves this big countless times, so none of us felt afraid.
　　The gunboat moved forward, tossing in the waves. Our eyes searched in the waves. When we patrolled to Simuyu, suddenly, the second gunner reported: "Comrade Captain, there's a dark object twenty degrees to starboard, one nautical mile away." The captain picked up his binoculars, and the dark object appeared in the binoculars. The object seemed to be rocking up and down with the waves. At the same time, two small gray-white dots could be vaguely seen on top of the object. The captain ordered the signalman to send a signal reporting the situation to the deputy command boat ahead, and at the same time changed course and sailed towards the object.
　　The gunboat sped forward on the crest of the waves.
　　The object became larger and larger. When it was only a few dozen meters away, it became clear that it was a capsized fishing boat, with two people clinging to the bottom of the boat. The captain ordered a reduction in speed, using the boat's remaining momentum to approach the capsized fishing boat.
　　When the speed decreased, the gunboat tossed even more violently. Therefore, it was impossible to get close to the fishing boat, and we didn't dare to get close either. Because getting close would risk smashing the fishing boat. "Get close! Saving people is the most important thing!" the captain thought to himself. But then he thought, "No! I can't! What if the fishing boat is smashed?..." "Captain! Throw a lifebuoy?" Suddenly, He Fu reminded the captain, and we immediately threw lifebuoys tied with ropes towards the boat. Just right, several lifebuoys landed on the bottom of the boat. However, neither of the two people clinging to the bottom of the boat grabbed them, so the lifebuoys were washed away by the waves. We threw the lifebuoys again, but still no one grabbed them, and the lifebuoys were washed away again. "Why aren't they grabbing them?" We were all worried about the two people. We all asked the captain together: "Captain, I'll go down! I'll go down! I..." The captain looked at everyone and was undecided, when suddenly, a large wave crashed over, sweeping the fishing boat into the waves. It only surfaced after a long time, more than ten meters further away from us. When we saw this, we became even more anxious and asked the captain together: "Captain, let me go down?..." The captain ordered to accelerate and bring the boat closer to the fishing boat, before resolutely saying: "He Fu and Liu Yan, go down and save people! Chen Guofu, take the cable and tie the fishing boat firmly, be especially careful!" As soon as he finished speaking, the three of them jumped into the waves together.
　　The waves rolled mercilessly, sometimes lifting them high, and sometimes suddenly throwing them down. We grabbed the railings, staring intently at the three of them without blinking. Suddenly, a wave crashed over, sweeping He Fu and Liu Yan, who were swimming in front, into the waves. Our hearts immediately tensed up, and we all held our breath for them. After several seconds, they finally surfaced. The waves seemed to be deliberately playing tricks on us. Just as He Fu and Liu Yan surfaced, Chen Guofu was swept away by the wave behind them. Chen Guofu just surfaced, but He Fu and Liu Yan were nowhere to be seen again. Our hearts tightened and loosened with them. After several times like this, He Fu and Liu Yan finally swam to the side of the capsized fishing boat. We felt slightly relieved when we saw them climb onto the bottom of the fishing boat.
　　He Fu and Liu Yan hurried to hug the two people as soon as they climbed up, but it was as if someone was pulling them from below. They tried to hug them several times but couldn't lift them up. They felt carefully and realized that the two people had tied their waists to the rudder mast behind them with straw ropes before they were choked unconscious by the seawater. Only then did He Fu realize that if it weren't for the straw ropes, they would have been washed away by the waves long ago.
　　He Fu and Liu Yan were frozen numb all over, but they didn't care about that in order to save people. They went to untie the straw ropes around the two people's waists. However, the straw ropes were swollen from being soaked in seawater, the knots were even tighter, and their hands were so frozen that they wouldn't obey, so they couldn't untie them after a long time. They used their mouths to gnaw at the straw ropes. The straw ropes were soaked with seawater, and their mouths were filled with a bitter and salty taste as soon as they touched the straw ropes. As they gnawed, a huge wave crashed over. He Fu and Liu Yan quickly hugged the two people tightly. The wave crashed over, sweeping the people and the boat together into the water. When they surfaced, only the boat was left. When we saw that there was no one on the bottom of the boat, our hearts immediately tightened like a fully drawn bow. After a long while, we saw them emerge from the waves. It turned out that the straw rope that was about to be gnawed through had been broken by the wave.
　　When we saw He Fu and Liu Yan emerge from the waves, we quickly threw over the lifebuoys with the ropes tied to them. He Fu and Liu Yan clung to the lifebuoys, and we pulled them back, carrying the rescued old man and girl into the front cabin...

### 浪里救渔船

    浪里救渔船	下士　杨光明
    在1955年11月末的一个下午，我们××大队×队在江中抛锚。同志们都在舱内谈笑。突然，值更的讯号员走进舱来报告道：“艇长同志，码头上发来讯号，命令我们526艇和副指挥艇马上起航出海巡逻！”
    我们迅速地起动了主机，和副指挥艇排着单纵队，迎着五级强风，冲破浪涛，向闽江口外驶去。
    一出闽江口，浪就越来越大。炮艇在浪里颠簸着，浪头，不断地扑上艇来，溅起的水花像暴雨似地浇打在我们的脸上。这样大的浪，我们遇到过无数次，因此，谁也不感到恐惧。
    炮艇在浪里颠簸着前进。我们的两眼在浪里寻视。当我们巡逻到四母屿时，突然，二战位报告道：“艇长同志，在右舷二十度，距离一浬，发现一个黑东西。”艇长拿起望远镜，在望远镜里出现了那个黑东西。那东西好像在随着浪一上一下地摇晃。同时，还模糊地看见那个东西上面有两个灰白的小点。艇长命令讯号员发讯号把所发现的情况报告给前面的副指挥艇，同时调转了航向，向那个东西开了过去。
    炮艇在浪峰上疾驰前进。
    那东西越来越大，直到几十公尺处，才清清楚楚地看见那是一只翻了的渔船，船底上扒着两个人。艇长命令减低速度，利用艇的余力，向那翻了的渔船靠去。
    速度一减低，炮艇颠簸得更厉害。因此无法靠拢渔船，同时也不敢靠拢。因为一靠拢就有把渔船碰碎的危险。“靠！救人要紧！”艇长心里这样想着。但又一想，“不！不能！把渔船碰碎了怎办？……”“艇长！投救生圈吧？”突然，何富提醒了艇长，我们马上把救生圈上拴着缆绳向船上投去。正好，几个救生圈都落在船底上。可是，扒在船底上的两个人谁也不接，因此救生圈被浪给打了下来。我们又把救生圈再次投过去，仍然没有人接，救生圈又被浪给打了下来。“他俩为什么不接呢？”我们心里都在为那两个人着急。都一起向艇长要求道：“艇长，我下去！我下去！我……”艇长看了看大家，正在拿不定主意时，突然，一个大浪扑过去，把渔船卷进浪里。好半天才冒出来，离我们又远了十几公尺。我们一看，心里更着急起来，又一起向艇长要求：“艇长，我下去吧？……”艇长命令加速，将艇向渔船靠拢了一些，才坚决地说：“何富和刘燕下去救人，陈国富带着缆绳，把渔船拴牢，要特别注意！”话刚落音，三个人一起跳进了浪里。
    浪，没命地卷着，一时将他们高高举了起来，一时又突然将他们抛了下去。我们抓着栏杆，不转眼地紧盯着他们三个人。突然，一个浪头扑了过来，把游在前面的何富和刘燕卷进了浪里。我们的心立刻紧张起来，都为他俩捏一把汗，好几秒钟后，他俩才冒出头来。浪涛好像有意和我们捣蛋似的，何富和刘燕刚冒出头来，又把后面的陈国富卷了进去。陈国富刚冒出来，但是何富和刘燕又看不见了。我们的心跟着他们一紧一松。这样经过了好几次，何富和刘燕才游到那个翻了的渔船旁边。看见他俩爬上了渔船底，我们的心才稍微松了一点。
    何富和刘燕爬上去就急忙抱那两个人，可是，下面好像有谁拉着似地，抱了几次都没抱起来。他俩仔细一摸，原来那两个人在被海水呛晕过去以前，用草绳将自己的腰拴在后面的舵桅上。这时何富才明白，要不是草绳拴着，他俩早就被浪打走了。
    何富和刘燕全身冻得直发麻，但为了救人，也顾不得这些。就去解那两个人腰里的草绳。但是，草绳被海水泡得发胀了，绳结更牢了，手又冻得一点也不听指挥，解了好久也没解开。他俩就用嘴去啃草绳。那草绳浸满了海水，嘴一接触到草绳，就充满了又苦又咸的气味。啃着、啃着，前面扑来一个巨浪，何富和刘燕急忙紧紧地抱着那两个人，浪头扑了过来，连人带船一起卷了进去。当冒出来时，光剩下一个船了。我们一见船底上没有人，心立刻像满弓弦一样紧了起来。好一会才见他们从浪里冒出来。原来是那将要被啃断的草绳却被浪给打断了。
    我们一见何富和刘燕从浪里冒了出来，就迅速地把拴好缆绳的救生圈投过去。何富和刘燕扒在救生圈上，我们把他们拉了回来，把救上来的一个老头和一个姑娘抬进了前舱……。
