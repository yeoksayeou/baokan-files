Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 22nd: On the evening of the 21st, President Sukarno announced his plan to reform the status quo in the State Palace Hall. President Sukarno decided to personally lead the National Council stipulated in the plan. The National Council and the future cabinet will be composed of representatives from various parties and all sectors, including the Indonesian Communist Party.

More than 900 representatives of political parties and social organizations, senior government officials and senior military officers, workers, farmers, intellectuals, women and youth, etc., listened to this important speech in the hall, including former Vice President Hatta.

Sukarno said that the difficulties and instability encountered by Indonesia in the eleven years since its independence were due to "errors in our system and errors in the government system." This was due to the implementation of "imported" Western democracy that "does not conform to the spirit of the Indonesian people."

Sukarno announced that, according to his plan, a cooperation cabinet and a national council will be established. Whether it is the Masyumi Party or the Communist Party, as long as the party has a sufficient proportion of votes in Congress, it will participate in the cabinet without exception. Small parties in Congress will also serve as deputy ministers in the cabinet.

Sukarno said that it is fair for all political parties to participate in the cabinet, "because regardless of which party we belong to, we are all equally Indonesian people." He said, "I just want to restore the integrity of the Indonesian nation. We treat all parties equally." He also said that this is in line with the spirit of cooperation in Indonesia. By conducting consultations in a big-family-like and cooperative atmosphere, there will be no opposition disputes aimed at overthrowing the cabinet. He said that such a cabinet can be formed and will be more stable than past cabinets.

Sukarno said that the National Council will be composed of the following people or representatives, namely: workers, farmers, intellectuals, national entrepreneurs, Christians, Muslims, women, youth, participants in the 1945 independence struggle, local representatives, chiefs of staff of the three services, chief of police, prosecutor general, and some important cabinet members. The council will be led by the President himself. Sukarno said that this council will include the entire Indonesian nation without discrimination.

The President said that the task of this council is to make recommendations to the cabinet, not to make demands on the cabinet. It is parallel to the cabinet, and its relationship with the cabinet is close through recommendations. Sukarno said that this will create a bridge connecting Congress, the cabinet, society, and the National Council, so that the wishes of society can be reflected in the cabinet.

Sukarno said that the implementation of this plan is also to achieve domestic peace. He also said that the mutual assistance of the cooperation cabinet and the national council, and the combination of the government and social forces, will make Indonesia strong.

Sukarno mentioned the issue of some parties opposing the entry of the Indonesian Communist Party into the cabinet. He said, "I ask very calmly: Can we continue to ignore a group that has won six million votes in the election?" He believes that to carry out construction, it is necessary to concentrate all the forces in society, and the Indonesian Communist Party has many masses among the workers.

Sukarno said, "Some people say that I formulated this plan to lead the cabinet to the left, but I have no left-wing or right-wing terms. I just want the Indonesian country and nation to restore integrity and eliminate all separatist phenomena."

Sukarno hopes that the leaders of all parties will study his plan. He will summon representatives of all parties on February 28 to solicit opinions.

Sukarno's speech lasted for an hour. During his speech, the masses gathered around the loudspeakers on the streets in front of and behind the State Palace. They held torches, lanterns and national flags high, and cheered and applauded continuously.

Indonesian Radio broadcast Sukarno's speech to all parts of the country. All cinemas in Jakarta were closed. People all over the city listened to the live broadcast of the President's speech in their homes, squares, and various public places.

President Sukarno's plan has been brewing for a long time. For two or three months, he has conducted extensive contacts and consultations with various political parties and representative figures from all sectors. The plan has also been discussed by various political parties many times.

    实现国内和平　恢复民族完整　消除分裂现象
    苏加诺总统公布改革现状方案
    决定亲自领导民族委员会并建立合作内阁
    由包括共产党的各党派和各方面人物组成
    新华社雅加达22日电　21日晚上，苏加诺总统在国家宫大厅里宣布了他的改革现状的方案。苏加诺总统决定亲自领导方案中规定的民族委员会。民族委员会和将来的内阁由包括印度尼西亚共产党在内的各个党派和各方面的代表性人物组成。
    各政党和社会团体的代表、政府高级官员和高级军官、工人、农民、知识分子、妇女和青年的代表等九百多人在大厅里听取了这个重要的演说，听众中有前副总统哈达。
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚独立十一年以来遇到的困难和发生的不稳定局势，原因是“我们制度的错误和政府制度的错误”。这是由于实行了“不符合印度尼西亚人民精神”的“输入的”西方民主。
    苏加诺宣布，根据他的方案，要成立一个合作内阁和一个民族委员会。不论马斯友美党或者共产党，只要在国会中有足够规定比例票数的政党，都将没有例外地参加这个内阁。国会中的小党派也将入阁担任副部长。
    苏加诺说，所有政党都参加内阁是公正的，“因为我们不论属于那个党派，都同样是印度尼西亚人民”。他说，“我只要恢复印度尼西亚民族的完整。我们对各党派一视同仁。”他又说，这是符合于印度尼西亚的合作精神的。使大家在大家庭般的和合作的气氛中进行协商，就不会有以推翻内阁为目的的反对派的争吵。他说，这样的内阁是能够组成的，而且将比过去的内阁更加稳定。
    苏加诺说，民族委员会将由下列人士或代表组成，即：工人、农民、知识分子、民族企业家、基督教徒、伊斯兰教徒、妇女、青年、1945年独立斗争的参加者、地方代表、三军参谋长、警察总长、检察总长和一些重要的阁员。这个委员会由总统自己领导。苏加诺说，这个委员会将不分彼此地把全印度尼西亚民族包罗在内。
    总统说，这个委员会的任务是向内阁提出建议而不向内阁提出要求。它和内阁是平行的，通过建议使它同内阁的关系密切起来。苏加诺说，这样就将有一座桥梁贯通国会、内阁、社会和民族委员会，使社会的愿望反映到内阁中去。
    苏加诺说，实行这个方案也是为了实现国内和平。他又说，合作内阁和民族委员会的互相帮助、政府同社会力量之间的结合，将使印度尼西亚强大起来。
    苏加诺提到了有些方面反对印度尼西亚共产党入阁的问题。他说，“我非常冷静地问道：难道我们能够一直漠视在大选中获得六百万选票的集团吗？”他认为，要进行建设就要集中社会上的一切力量，而印度尼西亚共产党在工人中有着很多的群众。
    苏加诺说，“有人说我制定这个方案是要把内阁导向左倾，但在我没有左翼右翼的名词，我只是要印度尼西亚国家和民族恢复完整，消除一切分裂现象。”
    苏加诺希望各党派领袖研究他的方案。他将在2月28日召见各党派代表征求意见。
    苏加诺的讲话共长一小时。在他演说时，群众拥集在国家宫前后街道上的扩音器周围。他们高举火炬，灯笼和国旗，不断地欢呼鼓掌。
    印度尼西亚广播电台把苏加诺的演说转播到全国各地。雅加达全市的电影院都停止营业。全市人民都在家里、广场上和各种公共场所里收听总统演说的实况转播。
    苏加诺总统的这个方案经过了长时间的酝酿。两、三个月来他同各政党和各方面的代表性人物进行了广泛的接触和协商。方案也屡次经过各政党的讨论。
