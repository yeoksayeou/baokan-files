    Publication of the First Draft of "Teaching Outline of Chinese Philosophy History"
    The "Teaching Outline of Chinese Philosophy History" (First Draft), edited by the Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of the Philosophy Department of Peking University, has begun to be published in the February issue of the "New Construction" magazine. This outline is divided into four parts: the first part is the philosophy of the pre-Qin era, the second part is the philosophy from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Sui and Tang dynasties, the third part is the philosophy from the Song to the Qing dynasty (before the Opium War), and the fourth part is modern philosophy (from the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement). Before the draft of the first part was published, the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences organized discussions among philosophy experts in Beijing. The publication of this outline is to solicit opinions from the academic community more broadly, in order to make further revisions.

    中国哲学史“讲授提纲”初稿发表
    北京大学哲学系中国哲学史教研室主编的“中国哲学史讲授提纲”（初稿），已在“新建设”杂志2月号上开始发表。这个提纲共分四部分：第一部分是先秦时代的哲学，第二部分是秦汉到隋唐时代的哲学，第三部分是宋到清代（鸦片战争以前）的哲学，第四部分是近代（由鸦片战争到五四运动）的哲学。第一部分的草稿发表前，曾由科学院哲学研究所组织在北京的哲学专家进行了讨论。这个提纲的发表是为了更广泛地吸收学术界的意见，以便作进一步的修改。
