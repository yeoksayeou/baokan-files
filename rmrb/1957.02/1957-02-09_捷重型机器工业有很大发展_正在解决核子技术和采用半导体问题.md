Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 8th. The Czechoslovak Minister of Heavy Machinery Industry, Mr. Bukala, said that last year the production of Czechoslovakia's heavy machinery industry increased by 12.2% compared to 1955.

In answering questions from reporters of the "People's Defense Daily," Mr. Bukala spoke about the main tasks facing the domestic heavy machinery industry in 1957. He said that this year, twenty-five production departments in various Czechoslovak factories will be modernized. This particularly refers to departments producing electrical technology equipment, regulating equipment, air compressors, pumps, machine tools, transportation equipment, and textile machinery.

The main problem facing technicians and innovation workers is to reduce the weight of machinery and equipment, improve the quality and capacity of machinery and equipment, and reduce the time required to produce them. In addition, great attention will be paid to the mechanization and automation of machine tools and design machines, which will increase by 6.5% this year.

The minister emphasized that the Czechoslovak heavy machinery industry is solving nuclear technology problems for the first time, mainly for the construction of the country's first atomic energy power station. Great importance will also be attached to reaching high parameters for steam power stations, vigorously adopting semiconductors in industry, and developing the manufacture of cold-rolled steel. In addition, Czechoslovak technicians will design new excavators for open-pit coal mining, which will have a digging volume at least 60% greater than current excavators. New cranes and digging machines for the construction industry will be of world-class standard. In the transportation sector, the problem of using electric locomotives and diesel locomotives will be solved.

Mr. Bukala also talked about the export of heavy machinery. He said that China currently ranks first in Czechoslovakia's heavy machinery exports, followed by the Soviet Union.

    捷重型机器工业有很大发展
    正在解决核子技术和采用半导体问题
    新华社布拉格8日电　捷克斯洛伐克重型机器工业部长布卡拉说，去年捷克斯洛伐克重型机器工业的生产比1955年提高了12.2％。
    布卡拉在回答“人民防线报”记者的问题时谈到了国内重型机器工业1957年所面临的主要任务。他说，今年捷克斯洛伐克各类工厂有二十五个生产部门将加以现代化。这特别指的是生产电气技术设备、调节设备、空气压缩机、抽水机、工作母机、运输装备和纺织机器等部门。
    技术人员和革新工作者们所面临的主要问题是减低机器和设备的重量，提高机器设备的质量和能力，并且减少生产它们所需要的时间。另外，对工作母机和设计机器的机械化和自动化问题也将给予很大的注意，这些机器今年将增加6.5％。
    这位部长强调说，捷克斯洛伐克重型机器工业正第一次在解决核子技术问题，这主要是为了兴建国内的第一个原子能电力站。关于达到蒸汽发电站的高参数问题、在工业上大力采用半导体问题以及发展制造冷轧钢的问题等也将受到很大重视。此外，捷克斯洛伐克技术人员将设计出供露天采煤用的新式挖掘机，它的挖掘量至少将比目前的挖掘机大60％。供建筑工业用的新型起重机以及挖凿机将具有世界水平。在运输部门，将解决使用电气机车、柴油机车的问题。
    布卡拉另外还谈到重型机器出口的情况。他说，目前中国已经占捷克斯洛伐克重型机器输出量的第一位，其次是苏联。
