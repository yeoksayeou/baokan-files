What is the "European Common Market"?
    Wu Ming
    Currently, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg are intensely discussing the establishment of the "European Common Market." Some people are vigorously promoting what benefits the establishment of the "Common Market" will bring to the participating countries.
    What exactly is this "Common Market"? In fact, it is not a new thing; it is a product of the so-called "European integration" concept advocated by the United States after the war. The United States wants to promote the "integration" of Western Europe with the aim of weakening the sovereignty of Western European countries, placing the entire Western Europe under the control of the United States, and turning it into an advanced base for anti-Sovietism. According to this concept, Western Europe has established a series of joint economic, political, and military organizations. In 1952, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg formed a "Coal and Steel Community" organization, forming a "Common Market" for coal and steel among the six countries, with mutual exemption from import taxes. The "Common Market" currently under discussion is a further development of this "Coal and Steel Community."
    With the postwar economic recovery and development of capitalist countries, the competition for international markets has become increasingly fierce. The expansion of American power in the capitalist world market has put tremendous pressure on European capitalist countries in particular. Within Western Europe, heavy tariff barriers and import restrictions hinder the flow of goods, labor, and capital. Some European monopoly capital groups want to expand the European internal market through a European trade "liberalization" arrangement, while at the same time forming a common tariff policy to strengthen their competitive position against countries outside Western Europe, mainly against the United States.
    In early June 1955, at the foreign ministers' meeting of the six "Coal and Steel Community" countries held in Messina, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg officially proposed the establishment of a "European Common Market." In March 1956, the "Coal and Steel Community" parliament met to discuss the specific plan for establishing the "Common Market" proposed by the expert committee. The meeting passed a resolution expressing its support for the establishment of the "Common Market" and suggesting that their respective governments sign a treaty. Since then, the plan has been repeatedly discussed among the countries. Until the Suez crisis occurred, the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt failed, and then the United States put forward the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Western European countries faced new economic difficulties, and the balance of power in the Middle East region, which had always been regarded as the traditional sphere of influence of Western European countries, was changed. This new situation prompted Western European countries to step up consideration of forming a "Common Market." The French parliament, which had previously been relatively reserved about this type of "common" arrangement, expressed its support at the beginning of this year, which accelerated the activities of organizing the "Common Market." In late January and early February of this year, the foreign ministers of the six countries held continuous meetings to discuss the draft treaty of the "Common Market." According to the draft, the main content of the "Common Market" is: the establishment of a customs union among the six countries, the gradual abolition of tariffs among themselves within twelve or fifteen years, and consistent external tariffs; the abolition of internal trade controls; the free flow of capital and labor among countries, and so on. Because agreement has not yet been reached on some important clauses, the draft will be discussed again by the prime ministers of the six countries.
    From the reactions of all parties and the twists and turns after the "Common Market" plan was put forward, it can be seen that this market plan, which touts Western European economic cooperation and is named "common," is actually a combination containing multiple internal and external contradictions. Participants each have their own plans. The two major monopoly capitalist countries, the United States and Britain, which are standing outside, also want to make it conform to their own interests.
    West German monopoly capital wholeheartedly supports the "Common Market" plan. The "liberalization" of the European internal market is most beneficial to West Germany, which has abundant capital, high productivity, relatively low labor costs, superior technical conditions, and currently low tariffs. The abolition of tariff barriers and trade restrictions will help its commodities flood the European market and facilitate the penetration of its strong capital into the economies of other participating countries. West Germany has long been the largest creditor in the "European Payments Union." Through this "Common Market" arrangement, West Germany will be able to gradually gain economic hegemony on the Western European continent, thereby strengthening its position in the entire capitalist world market and confronting the United States and Britain. No wonder the West German government spokesman immediately expressed satisfaction when the French parliament expressed its support for the "Common Market." West German Foreign Minister Brentano has clearly stated that in West Germany's mind, the "Common Market" is a step towards a common Western European trade, financial, and monetary policy.
    For France, another major participant, the prospect is not so wonderful. France's production costs are higher, its competitiveness in the international market is weaker, and its current exports are maintained by various government subsidy measures; at the same time, many of its domestic industries are currently protected by stricter import restrictions and higher tariffs. Due to poor foreign trade conditions, the position of the franc has long been very unstable. In addition, compared with countries such as West Germany, France's social welfare is still relatively high. Once mutual restrictions are eliminated within the "Common Market," France's economy will first be greatly impacted by the forces of West German monopoly capital. This is why France has always been more hesitant and cautious about establishing a "Common Market." However, if France does not participate in the "Common Market," it will be excluded from this market, which would create another threat. In addition, in the eyes of some powerful capital groups in France, West Germany's abundant capital and Italy's large surplus of labor are also what they need. The "Common Market" arrangement will help them lower the living standards of the French working people. They will also be able to find more favorable investment opportunities elsewhere. At the same time, for agricultural capital groups eager to expand the sales of agricultural products, banking capital groups that have long been linked to financial capital in West Germany, Belgium, and other countries, and some monopoly groups that have gained some benefits in the "Coal and Steel Community," the "Common Market" may not be unprofitable. Therefore, in the French parliament in late January of this year, Mollet acknowledged that participating in the "Common Market" was a risk, but on the other hand, he asked the parliament to agree to the principle of establishing a "Common Market." The French National Assembly also decided to authorize the government to negotiate the "Common Market" issue on the condition of reserving import surcharges and export subsidies, guaranteeing preferential conditions for French agricultural products in the markets of West Germany and other countries, and requiring other countries to provide funds for France to develop overseas territories. These reservations reflect the concerns of the French bourgeoisie and the special care they want to get from the "Common Market" arrangement, while the government and parliament's approval shows that the French bourgeoisie, in a dilemma, decided to take a "very risky gamble," in the words of the French "Le Monde."
    As for Italy and other small Western European countries, they also have their own plans. For example, Italy hopes that the "Common Market" arrangement will help attract the capital it lacks and export its large number of unemployed standing armies. A common hope of these countries is that the establishment of a "Common Market" can improve their foreign trade situation and enable them to more easily obtain some tariff concessions from the United States through this arrangement. The high tariff barriers and dumping policies of the United States put these countries at a disadvantage in trade with the United States.
    Because of these complex contradictions, many disputes have arisen in the discussion of the draft treaty on the "Common Market," and a final agreement has not been reached. According to Western news agency reports, the current obstacle is the conditions put forward by France, mainly the issue of French overseas territories participating in the "Common Market." France hopes to use the "Common Market" arrangement to develop its territories, but is afraid that its colonial power will be squeezed out as a result. Therefore, it requires a common investment plan to ensure its control over the development activities in its territories. These protective demands of France have aroused dissatisfaction from other countries, especially West Germany. West German economic newspapers complain that these conditions are "absurd things."
    When discussing the issue of the "European Common Market," one must consider the attitudes of Britain and the United States.
    Britain has always opposed arrangements such as the European regional "Common Market" because it may damage its position as a "world merchant," and this arrangement may be used by West Germany to strengthen its competition with Britain in Europe. However, recently it has expressed interest in the "Common Market" plan. This is consistent with the concept of establishing a "third force" that Britain put forward some time ago. Because Britain's contradictions with the United States are becoming increasingly acute, especially after the Suez crisis, Britain's economic dependence on the United States has become more exposed. It hopes to strengthen its position in dealing with the United States by establishing some kind of economic alliance with Western European countries. On the other hand, if Britain continues to stand outside the European common arrangement, it risks being excluded from the traditional market on the continent. However, Britain does not intend to abandon its preferential arrangements within the Commonwealth as the price for establishing the "European Common Market." Therefore, it expressed its willingness to establish links with the "Common Market" and put forward its own plan for a European "free trade zone." This arrangement would allow Britain to benefit from the European Community, while maintaining its freedom of action and still enjoying its preferential relationship with Commonwealth countries. It also advocates not including agricultural products in the scope of free trade, because Britain can now obtain cheap supplies from within the Commonwealth. However, this proposition is contradictory to the demands of countries such as France and Italy, which export large quantities of agricultural products.
    The United States originally advocated Western European "integration." Therefore, slogans such as the "European Common Market" are welcome to Washington, which is determined to weaken the sovereignty of European countries. Moreover, in Washington's view, this type of arrangement can be beneficial to strengthening the role of the current Washington-Bonn axis. However, it is wary of the possibility that this European common arrangement will be used to strengthen the relative position of European countries vis-à-vis the United States. That is why the United States, while expressing its approval, does not forget to warn that any such arrangement should not discriminate against the United States. Washington especially emphasizes that Western Europe's strength and unity should be strengthened "within the enlarged Atlantic group." The implication is that all European common arrangements should be part of the overall arrangement of the United States and cannot be separated from Washington's influence. At present, the United States is closely watching the progress of the activities to establish a European common market, with a relatively implicit attitude. Some say that Washington is reserving its bullets to shoot later.
    It can be seen that the establishment of the "European Common Market" is a struggle of intrigue that is far from over. Judging from the attitudes of the governments concerned, some form of "European Common Market" will probably be established. The establishment of such a community full of struggle and contradictions will undoubtedly bring many consequences. It is too early to accurately estimate these consequences now, but in any case, one thing is certain: the establishment of the "Common Market" will subject the working people of Western Europe to new attacks. Not only will the wage and welfare levels in countries such as France and Belgium, which are still higher than those in West Germany, be reduced, but the result of the free flow of labor on a larger scale will enable the bourgeoisie to use the huge unemployed army and cheap labor to deal with the working class. At the same time, this common arrangement also contains an obvious danger to the European people. The sovereignty of the participating countries will be further weakened. The division of Germany and Europe will be deepened as a result. Although the participants in the "European Common Market" intend to unite to deal with the pressure from the United States, the United States will not let go of this opportunity to try to further incorporate Western European countries into its European plan. As the Coal and Steel Community has already shown, the "Common Market" will facilitate the further expansion of West German monopoly capital, which is the most powerful of the six countries. History has repeatedly proven what the expansion of the most aggressive German monopoly capital forces will bring to the European people!

    什么是“欧洲共同市场”？
    吴明
    目前，法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡六国正在紧张地讨论着建立“欧洲共同市场”的问题。有些人正在大肆宣传，建立“共同市场”对参加国会有什么什么好处。
    这个“共同市场”倒底是什么呢？其实它并不是什么新鲜的东西，它是战后美国所提倡的所谓“欧洲整体化”观念的一个产物。美国要促使西欧“整体化”，其目的是为了削弱西欧国家的主权，把西欧整个置于美国的掌握之下，并且变成一个反苏的前进基地。按照这个观念，西欧成立了一系列经济、政治和军事性的共同组织。1952年法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡六国组成了一个“煤钢联营”组织，形成六国煤钢的“共同市场”，彼此免征进口税。目前商谈中的“共同市场”，就是这个“煤钢共同市场”的进一步发展。
    随着资本主义各国战后经济的恢复和发展，国际市场的争夺越来越激烈。美国势力在资本主义世界市场上的扩张，特别使欧洲资本主义国家感到巨大的压力。在西欧内部，重重的关税壁垒和入口限制，阻碍着商品、劳动力和资金的流动。欧洲的一些垄断资本集团想通过一种欧洲贸易“自由化”的安排，来扩大欧洲的内部市场，同时形成一种共同的关税政策，加强它们对西欧大陆以外主要是对美国的竞争地位。
    1955年6月初，在墨西拿举行的“煤钢联营”六国外长会议上，比、荷、卢三国正式提出建立“欧洲共同市场”的建议。1956年3月，“煤钢联营”议会开会，讨论了专家委员会提出的建立“共同市场”的具体方案。会议通过决议，表示赞成建立“共同市场”，并向各自的政府建议签订条约。从这以后，计划在各国间反复磋商。直到苏伊士问题发生，英法侵略埃及失败，接着美国提出了“艾森豪威尔主义”，西欧国家在经济上产生了新的困难，并且改变了一直被认为是西欧国家传统势力范围的西亚地区的力量对比关系。这一新的形势促使西欧国家加紧考虑组成“共同市场”。原来对这类“共同”安排态度比较保留的法国议会在今年初表示了赞同，这就使组织“共同市场”的活动加速进行起来。今年1月底和2月初，六国外长连续举行会议，讨论“共同市场”条约草案。根据草案规定，“共同市场”的主要内容是：建立六国间的关税同盟，在十二年或十五年内逐步废除相互间的关税，对外关税一致；内部废除贸易管制；各国间资本和劳动力自由流动等等。由于在某一些重要条款上还未能取得协议，草案将再由六国总理会议来讨论。
    从“共同市场”计划提出后各方面的反应和反复周折的情况可以看出，这个标榜西欧经济合作并被名为“共同”的市场计划实际上是一个包藏着多种内部和外部矛盾的结合体。参加者各有自己的打算。站在外边的两个主要垄断资本主义国家美国和英国也都想使它符合于自己的利益。
    西德垄断资本是双手赞成“共同市场”计划的。欧洲内部市场的“自由化”，对于资金雄厚、生产力大、劳动力比较低廉、技术条件优越并且目前关税较低的西德是最为有利不过的。关税壁垒和贸易限制的取消，将会有助于使它的商品泛滥欧洲市场，便利于它的强大资本渗入其他参加国家的经济。西德多时以来就已经是“欧洲支付同盟”里最大的债权国。通过“共同市场”这种安排，西德将能逐步取得西欧大陆经济的霸权，从而加强它在整个资本主义世界市场上和美英对峙的地位。无怪乎在法国议会对“共同市场”表示赞同时，西德政府发言人马上表示满意。西德外长勃伦塔诺已经明白表示，在西德的心意之中，“共同市场”是走向共同的西欧贸易、财政和货币政策的一个步骤。
    对于另一个主要参加国法国来说，前景就不见得是这样的美妙。法国的生产费用较高，在国际市场上竞争力量较弱，目前的出口已经是靠着政府各项津贴办法在维持；同时本国许多工业目前是用进口方面较严的限制和较高的关税保护起来的。由于对外贸易状况不好，法郎的地位早已非常不稳了。此外，和西德等国比较起来，法国的社会福利还算高一些。一旦在“共同市场”内消除了相互的限制，法国的经济就会首先受到西德垄断资本势力的巨大冲击。这就是为什么法国对建立“共同市场”始终比较犹豫和谨慎的原因。但是，法国如果不参加“共同市场”，就会被摒于这个市场之外，这会产生另外一方面的威胁。加之，在法国的一些有势力的资本集团眼里，西德的丰富资金、意大利的大量过剩的劳动力，也是他们所需要的。“共同市场”的安排会有助于他们降低法国劳动人民的生活水平。他们也将有可能在其它地方找寻更为有利的投资机会。同时，对于急于想扩大农产品销路的农业资本集团，早已同西德、比利时等国金融资本有着联系的银行资本集团，以及一部分在“煤钢联营”中得到了一些甜头的垄断集团来说，“共同市场”更未始不是有利可图的。因此，在今年1月下旬法国议会中，摩勒一方面承认参加“共同市场”是一种冒险，另一方面又要求议会同意建立“共同市场”的原则。而法国国民议会也在提出了保留进口附加税和出口补贴、保证法国农产品在西德等国市场上享受优惠条件以及要求其它国家拿出资金来让法国开发海外属地等种种条件的情况下，决定授权政府谈判“共同市场”问题。这些保留条件反映了法国资产阶级的担心和他们想从“共同市场”安排中得到的特殊照顾，而政府及议会的赞成表明处在左右为难的困境中的法国资产阶级决定来一场——用法国“世界报”的话说——“风险很大的赌博”。
    至于意大利和其它西欧小国，也有着它们自己的打算。例如，意大利希望“共同市场”的安排有助于吸引它所缺乏的资金和输出为数甚大的失业常备军。这些国家的一个共同希望是：建立“共同市场”可以改善它们的对外贸易情况，并且能够通过这种安排使得它们较易于取得美国在关税方面也作一些让步。美国的高关税壁垒和倾销政策使这些国家对美贸易处于不利的地位。
    因为有着这些错综的矛盾，有关“共同市场”的条约草案的讨论就发生了许多争执，一直未能达成最后的协议。据西方通讯社消息说，目前的障碍是法国提出的条件，主要是法国海外领地参加“共同市场”的问题。法国希望借力于“共同市场”的安排来开发它的属地，但又怕因此使自己的殖民势力受到排挤，因此要求有共同的投资计划，以保障它对属地开发活动的控制。法国的这一些保护性的要求已经引起了其它国家特别是西德的不满。西德的经济报刊埋怨这些条件是“荒谬的东西”。
    在讨论“欧洲共同市场”问题时，不能不联系到英国和美国的态度。
    英国一向是反对欧洲地区“共同市场”这一类安排的。因为这可能损害到它作为一个“世界商人”的地位，并且这种安排有可能被西德利用来加强同英国在欧洲的竞争。但是，最近它对于“共同市场”计划表示了兴趣。这是同英国前些时候提出来的建立“第三种力量”的观念一致的。由于英国同美国的矛盾日益尖锐，特别是苏伊士问题发生以后，英国在经济上依赖美国的弱点更加暴露出来，它希望靠建立同西欧国家之间的某种经济上的联盟关系，以便加强它同美国打交道的地位。另一方面，如果英国继续站在欧洲共同安排的外面，它就有被从大陆传统市场排斥的危险。但是英国却并不打算以放弃它在英联邦范围内的特惠安排作为建立“欧洲共同市场”的代价。因此它表示愿意和“共同市场”建立联系，又提出了自己的欧洲“自由贸易区”的计划。这样安排可以使英国利用欧洲共同体得到好处，又可以保持自己行动的自由，仍然享有它同英联邦国家的特惠关系。它还主张不把农产品包括在自由贸易范围之内，因为英国现在能够从联邦以内得到廉价的供应。但是这个主张同大量输出农产品的法、意等国的要求是矛盾的。
    美国原来是鼓吹西欧“整体化”的，因此“欧洲共同市场”之类的口号对于一心要削弱欧洲国家主权的华盛顿说来是值得欢迎的。而且在华盛顿看来，这类安排可以有利于加强目前华盛顿—波恩轴心的作用。但是它对于这种欧洲共同安排被用来加强欧洲国家对美国的相对地位的可能性是怀有戒心的。这就是为什么美国在表示赞同之余，不忘记提出警告：任何这类安排都不许对美国有所歧视。华盛顿特别强调应该“在扩大的大西洋集团范围内”来加强西欧的实力和团结。言外之意就是所有欧洲的共同安排都应该是美国总安排的一部分，而不能够脱离华盛顿的影响。目前美国正在密切注视着建立欧洲共同市场活动的进展，态度比较含蓄。有人说，华盛顿是保留着它的子弹到以后来射击。
    由此可见，建立“欧洲共同市场”是一场远未结束的钩心斗角的斗争。从有关各国政府的态度看来，某种形式的“欧洲共同市场”大概会要建立起来。这样一种充满着斗争和矛盾的共同体的成立，无疑将会带来许多后果。现在确切地来估计这种后果还为时过早，但是无论如何，有一点是肯定的，就是，“共同市场”的建立将会使西欧劳动人民遭到新的进攻。不但法国、比利时等国的比起西德来还算高一点的工资和福利水平将会降低，而且劳动力在更大范围内自由流动的结果，将使得资产阶级能够利用巨大的失业军和低廉劳动力来对付工人阶级。同时，这种共同安排还包含着一种对欧洲人民的明显危险。参加国家的主权将受到进一步的削弱。德国和欧洲的分裂将因此而加深。虽然“欧洲共同市场”的参加国怀有联合起来对付美国压力的意图，但同时美国将不会放松这个机会来试图把西欧国家更加纳入它的欧洲计划的轨道。像煤钢联营所已经表明的，“共同市场”将便利六国中实力最为雄厚的西德垄断资本的进一步扩张。历史已经一再证明，最富侵略性的德国垄断资本势力的扩大，会给欧洲人民带来什么！
