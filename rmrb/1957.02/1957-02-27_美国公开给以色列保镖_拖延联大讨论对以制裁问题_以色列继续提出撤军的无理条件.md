Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, New York Dispatch: The two plenary sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, originally scheduled to discuss the issue of Israeli withdrawal on the 25th, did not take place. The UN announced on the 25th that the meeting would be postponed to the 26th.

Some Asian and African countries have already put forward proposals to impose sanctions on Israel for refusing to withdraw from Egypt. Reports say that the delay in discussing this issue is related to the attitude of the United States. One meeting on the 25th was cancelled at the request of the United States.

U.S. President Eisenhower again conferred with Secretary of State Dulles on the Israeli withdrawal issue on the 25th. Dulles met with Israeli Ambassador Eban the day before, and Eban put forward some preconditions for the Israeli withdrawal.

According to ABC, Eban presented five demands to the United States. These five demands are: (1) Egypt agrees that U.S. merchant ships can pass through the Gulf of Aqaba, as a guarantee that Egypt will not "seize" this waterway. (2) The United States supports a proposal by Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson in the United Nations, which calls for the dispatch of an international naval force to be stationed in the Gulf of Aqaba. (3) Israel will agree to withdraw from the Gaza Strip "as long as Egypt does not enter." (4) Israel maintains economic ties with the Gaza Strip. (5) Deploy a "small number" of UN troops in the Gaza Strip.

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, London Dispatch: British Prime Minister Macmillan said in the House of Commons on the 25th, when talking about Israel's refusal to withdraw from the Gaza Strip: "We are unwilling to consider the issue of imposing sanctions on Israel."

Macmillan said: "We believe that Israel should withdraw from the Gaza Strip; we also believe that the United Nations should be responsible for managing this place, and UN troops should be stationed there."

He added: "We believe that the Israeli army should withdraw from the west bank of the Gulf of Aqaba; we also believe that at the same time as Israel withdraws from this place, the United Nations and major maritime countries should clearly state that all countries in the world can navigate these waters."

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, Jerusalem Israel District Dispatch: The Israeli Knesset passed a motion on the 25th by a vote of seventy-two to twenty-nine, supporting Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion's statement on February 21st announcing the continued refusal to unconditionally withdraw troops from the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba.

Before the Israeli Knesset held this meeting to end the foreign policy debate, the cabinet had repeatedly held emergency meetings. Ben-Gurion reiterated at the meeting that the condition for the Israeli army to withdraw from the Gulf of Aqaba was: "UN troops are stationed on the coast of the (Aqaba) Gulf until a solution is reached with Egypt, or there is an agreement with the coastal countries." He said that under no circumstances could Israel allow the Egyptian army or civil administration to return to the Gaza Strip.

Ben-Gurion also said that Israel's clearest guarantee regarding the Gulf of Aqaba is the Israeli navy. "If our ships are attacked, we will retaliate."

    美国公开给以色列保镖
    拖延联大讨论对以制裁问题
    以色列继续提出撤军的无理条件
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：原订在25日举行讨论以色列撤军问题的联合国大会两次全体会议都没有举行，联合国方面25日宣布，会议将延到26日举行。
    一些亚非国家已经提出了对拒绝从埃及撤军的以色列实行制裁的提案。消息说，关于这个问题的讨论被拖延，同美国的态度有关。25日的一次会议就是在美国要求下取消的。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔25日又同国务卿杜勒斯就以色列撤军问题会谈。杜勒斯在前一天同以色列大使伊班举行了会谈，伊班提出了关于以色列撤军的一些先决条件。
    据美国广播公司透露，伊班向美国提出了五点要求。这五点要求是：（一）埃及同意美国商船可以在亚喀巴湾通行，作为埃及不“夺取”这条水道的保证。（二）美国在联合国中支持加拿大外交部长皮尔逊的一项建议，这项建议要求派遣一支国际海军部队驻在亚喀巴湾。（三）以色列将同意撤出加沙地带，“只要埃及不进去”。（四）以色列同加沙地带保持经济联系。（五）派遣“人数不多”的联合国部队驻在加沙地带。
    据新华社26日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相麦克米伦25日在下院谈到以色列拒绝撤出加沙地带的问题的时候说：“我们不愿意考虑对以色列实行制裁的问题。”
    麦克米伦说：“我们认为，以色列应该撤出加沙地带；我们同样认为，应该由联合国负责管理这个地方，联合国部队应该驻在那里。”
    他又说：“我们认为，以色列军队应该撤出亚喀巴湾的西岸；我们同样认为，在以色列撤出这个地方的同时，联合国和主要的海运国家应该明确地表明：世界各国都可以在这些海面上航行”。
    据新华社26日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列议会在25日以七十二票对二十九票，通过支持以色列总理本—古里安2月21日发表的宣布继续拒绝无条件从加沙地带和亚喀巴湾撤出军队的声明。
    在以色列议会举行这次结束外交政策辩论的会议之前，内阁曾经一再举行紧急会议。本—古里安在会议上重申，以色列军撤出亚喀巴湾的条件是：“联合国部队驻扎在（亚喀巴）海湾的沿岸，一直到同埃及达成解决办法，或者有了沿海各国的协议的时候为止”。他说，以色列在任何情况之下，都不能允许埃及陆军或者民政机构重返加沙地带。
    本—古里安还说，以色列关于亚喀巴湾的最明确的保证就是以色列的海军。“如果我们的船只受到攻击，我们将予以反击。”
