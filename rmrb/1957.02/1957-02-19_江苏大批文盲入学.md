Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: Before the Spring Festival, the number of peasants in Jiangsu Province who enrolled in literacy classes reached three million.

In Pizhou, Xinghua, Binhai, Sheyang and other counties in Jiangsu, the number of students enrolled reached about 80% of the original plan. In Longxing Cooperative in Bacheng Township, Kunshan County, the number of farmers participating in winter studies has reached 89% of the total number of illiterate and semi-literate people in the cooperative. Generally, local people's schools have taught ten to twenty lessons, and the students recognize about two hundred new characters. Before the Spring Festival, a literacy graduation test was also conducted in various places. In the Yancheng area, more than 28,000 people were freed from illiteracy.

At present, people's schools in various parts of Jiangsu are resuming classes after the Spring Festival, and are conducting extensive literacy publicity through meetings, seminars, individual visits, and recreational activities. Relevant leaders have also organized inspection teams to go deep into the rural communities to check and help the people's schools solve specific problems such as kerosene for lamps, office expenses, and work-hour subsidies for teachers in the people's schools.
