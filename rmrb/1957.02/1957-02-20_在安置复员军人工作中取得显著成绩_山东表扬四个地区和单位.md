Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, February 18th: The Shandong Provincial People's Committee issued a circular on the 14th, commending Changyi County, the former Xueyu Township of Tai'an County, the Fengsu Agricultural Production Cooperative of Qixia County, and the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Materials Supply for their outstanding achievements in resettling demobilized soldiers. It also called on all regions and units to learn from them.

Since 1950, Changyi County has received and resettled a total of 5,124 demobilized soldiers. The county head and the secretary of the CCP County Committee often personally preside over research into the resettlement work of demobilized soldiers and decided that the district head and township head should be responsible for the resettlement work. The county has made it so that demobilized soldiers are received, resettled, and inspected as soon as they arrive. In addition to instructing districts and townships to earnestly help demobilized soldiers solve their difficulties, the county also has three cadres who are specifically responsible for conducting roving inspections. Around “August 1st” last year, 35 cadres were dispatched to conduct a comprehensive survey throughout the county, basically solving the problem of housing shortages for demobilized soldiers. Women's federations at all levels in the county and many district and township organizations also attach great importance to helping unmarried demobilized soldiers find spouses.

Before the amalgamation of townships, Xueyu Township in Tai'an County had a total of 21 demobilized soldiers. With the exception of five who went out to work or volunteered to reclaim wasteland in the Northeast, all the others participated in agricultural production. The township made appropriate arrangements for these demobilized soldiers based on their specific conditions. Ma Wenshui, who had been a nurse in the army, was assigned to be the health team leader in the agricultural cooperative. Wang Faceng, a cavalry messenger, was arranged to participate in transportation work. Ma Changying, an assistant driver, was assigned to operate the water pump, making sure that everyone was used to their full potential. The township cadres are also very concerned about the political progress and daily lives of demobilized soldiers. They often take the initiative to talk with them in normal times, and sometimes hold special forums for demobilized soldiers in conjunction with the central work to listen to their opinions and conduct policy education to improve their ideological and policy level.

The Fengsu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qixia County has already developed a culture of respecting demobilized soldiers. Usually, demobilized soldiers are absorbed to participate in the cadre meetings when work is arranged within the co-operative, so that they can understand the policies and play a backbone role among the masses. The co-operative also often uses the exemplary deeds of the demobilized soldiers who returned to their hometowns earlier to educate the demobilized soldiers who have just returned. At present, among the 21 demobilized soldiers in the entire co-operative, 19 have served as the secretaries of the CCP township general branch, the head and deputy head of the agricultural co-operative, the section chief, and the production team leader.

The Shandong Provincial Bureau of Materials Supply resolutely implemented the policy of giving priority to employing demobilized soldiers. Among the 79 new personnel added last year, 69 were demobilized soldiers. When demobilized soldiers arrived at the bureau, the responsible cadres personally presided over a welcome meeting to introduce the characteristics of local work and the bureau's business situation, and called on new and old comrades to strengthen unity and learn from each other. The leadership also tried its best to assign them suitable jobs according to the demobilized soldiers' physical condition, culture, and original positions, and also assigned special personnel to help them quickly become familiar with the business. Therefore, in less than a year, five demobilized soldiers were rated as advanced producers. The bureau is also very concerned about and considerate of the various difficulties in the lives of demobilized soldiers.

    在安置复员军人工作中取得显著成绩
    山东表扬四个地区和单位
    新华社济南18日电　山东省人民委员会14日发出通报，表扬在安置复员军人工作中取得显著成绩的昌邑县、泰安县原薛峪乡、栖霞县丰粟农业生产合作社和山东省物资供应局等四个地区和单位，并且号召各地区、各单位向他们学习。
    昌邑县自1950年以来共接收、安置了复员军人五千一百二十四名。这个县的县长和中共县委书记经常亲自主持研究复员军人的安置工作，并且决定区由区长、乡由乡长专管复员安置工作，对复员军人做到了随接收、随安置、随检查。这个县除责成区、乡认真帮助复员军人解决困难以外，县里还固定有三个干部专门负责巡回检查，去年“八一”前后，又抽出三十五名干部在全县普查一遍，基本上全部解决了复员军人无房缺房的困难。这个县各级妇女联合会和许多区乡组织还很重视帮助未婚复员军人成家。
    泰安县薛峪乡在并乡以前共有复员军人二十一名，除去外出和志愿到东北垦荒的五人外，其余全部参加了农业生产。这个乡对这些复员军人都根据各人的具体条件进行了适当安排。在部队上当过护士的马文水被分配在农业社里当保健组长。骑兵通讯员王发曾被安排参加运输工作。司机助手马长英被分配掌握抽水机，做到了量才使用，各得其所。这个乡的乡干部还很关心复员军人的政治进步和日常生活，平日经常主动找他们谈心，有时还结合中心工作，专门召开复员军人座谈会，听取他们的意见，并对他们进行政策教育，以提高他们的思想和政策水平。
    栖霞县的丰粟农业生产合作社里已经形成了尊敬复员军人的风气。平时社内开干部会布置工作时都吸收复员军人参加，使他们能了解政策，在群众中起骨干作用。这个社并经常运用早回乡的复员军人的模范事迹，教育刚回乡的复员军人。现在，全社二十一名复员军人中，有十九名担任了中共乡总支书记、农业社的正副社长、股长和生产队长等职务。
    山东省物资供应局坚决执行了优先录用复员军人的政策，在去年增加的七十九名新人员中，就有六十九名是复员军人。复员军人到局时，负责干部亲自主持开欢迎会，介绍地方工作特点和局内业务情况，号召新老同志加强团结、相互学习。领导上还尽可能根据复员军人的身体、文化和原来的职务等条件，分配他们合适的工作，并且还分配专人帮助他们迅速熟悉业务。因此，在不到一年的时间里，就有五个复员军人被评为先进生产者。这个局对复员军人生活上的各种困难也很关心体贴。
