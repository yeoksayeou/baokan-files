A Township That Properly Settles Demobilized Soldiers
Liu Fuhan

Since liberation, Gubei Township in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, has successively received and settled forty-two demobilized soldiers. After the demobilized soldiers returned to their hometowns, some problems arose in their work, thinking, production, and life. However, because the township people's committee was able to understand the situation in a timely manner, earnestly study it, and handle it properly, it was able to ensure that everyone respected leadership, obeyed assignments, settled down to production, and worked actively.

·Visiting Thrice· Comrade Liu Herong was demobilized and returned to his hometown in March 1956. The day after he returned to his hometown, Gubei Township Chief Fu Shaoqing, like he treated every returning demobilized soldier, made a special trip to visit Liu Herong's home. When they met, they grasped each other's hands tightly, as if they were comrades-in-arms who had been separated for a long time. After a long time, Township Chief Fu started talking to him: "You've worked hard! Since you joined the army, the township hasn't taken good enough care of your family. If you have any difficulties after returning home, please let us know so we can help solve them." After Township Chief Fu asked this, Liu Herong said: "I just came back, and there are no difficulties. It's just that the house is a bit leaky, but it doesn't matter. I still have some production subsidies, so I can repair it myself."

Township Chief Fu immediately looked at Liu Herong's leaky house and, after returning, immediately mobilized six workers from the Gubei Advanced Agricultural Cooperative and brought wood from three trees to help Liu Herong repair the house.

Half a month later, Township Chief Fu, with a sense of responsibility towards demobilized soldiers, entered Liu Herong's home for the second time. The township chief saw that Liu Herong seemed very troubled, so he asked him if he had any difficulties. Liu Herong stretched out a pair of hands, with blood blisters raised from productive labor, to show the township chief and said, "I can't do production work. Can you find me a job to do?" Township Chief Fu said, "Take your time, and you will gradually get used to it. I will also greet the production team leader and ask him to assign you some light farm work as much as possible. Besides, for people like us without education, it is even more difficult to find work!" After Township Chief Fu said this, Liu Herong felt very satisfied and had nothing more to say.

Later, when Township Chief Fu learned that Liu Herong needed to start a family, he instructed the township women's federation director to help resolve the matter. On October 22, 1956, only half a year after Comrade Liu Herong returned to his hometown, he married a girl surnamed Xiong. After the marriage, Liu's work and production became even more active.

·They Feel Satisfied· Gubei Township received a batch of demobilized soldiers around May 1956. Among them, six people lacked houses, but at that time it was the busy season for production. To solve all their housing problems, a batch of workers would have to be mobilized, which would affect production. The township studied the matter and believed that: For the time being, the housing problems of those who urgently need houses should be resolved first, and the others can wait until autumn. It was also decided to convene a forum for demobilized soldiers to explain the situation and let them discuss the matter themselves.

At the forum for demobilized soldiers, everyone discussed the township's opinions and unanimously agreed that Fu Shaobai, with a family of four living in half a room, really could not live there and needed to be resolved immediately. The others could wait until autumn according to the township's opinion.

Twenty-five days after the meeting, the two new thatched houses needed by Comrade Fu Shaobai were built.

·Becoming Active Again· Demobilized soldier Chen Luntian served as a party branch secretary, deputy director of the agricultural cooperative, and a security committee member, and he used to be very active in his work. However, after the autumn distribution, he became passive and did not leave his doorstep for more than two months. This problem kept swirling in the deputy township chief's mind. In fact, it was very simple: Since Chen Luntian took on various positions, he often had to attend various meetings. In addition to the cooperative director's meeting, the party branch secretary and security committee meetings were not recorded as work points by the cooperative. Because he lost too many workdays, he only did fifty workdays in a year, and when it came to distribution, he only received three yuan that he deserved. How could he not be worried about his future life when he considered this? After Township Chief Fu understood this situation, he discussed it with the township leadership and, through the agricultural cooperative, provided him with 25 yuan in relief, and suggested that the township party committee relieve him of his duties as party branch secretary and security committee member. From then on, people saw Chen Luntian working actively again.

    妥善安置复员军人的一个乡
    刘辅汉
    解放以来，安徽省金寨县古碑乡，先后接收安置复员建设军人四十二人。复员军人回乡后，在工作、思想、生产和生活上，都曾发生过一些问题。可是由于乡人民委员会能够及时了解情况，认真研究，妥善处理，因而做到个个尊重领导，服从分配，安心生产，积极工作。
    ·三顾茅芦·刘何荣同志，是1956年3月复员回乡的。在他回乡的第二天，古碑乡乡长傅绍庆像对待每一个回乡的复员军人一样，特地跑到刘何荣家里访问。他们见面时，仿佛久别重逢的战友，紧紧地握着手。好久，傅乡长便和他拉起来：“你辛苦了！从你参军之后，乡里对你的家庭照顾很不够。你回乡后有什么困难，请提提，我们好帮助解决”。刘何荣经乡长这样一问，便说：“我才回来，没有什么困难，就是房屋有一点破漏，不过，不要紧，我还带有一些生产资助金，自己可以修理”。
    傅乡长立即看了看刘何荣的破漏的房子，回去以后，马上从古碑高级农业社动员了六个人工，带了三棵树的木料，去帮助刘何荣把房子修好了。
    半个月后，傅乡长怀着对复员军人应有的责任感，第二次走进刘何荣的家里。乡长看到刘何荣好像很苦恼的样子，便问他有困难没有。刘何荣伸出一双因为生产劳动而鼓起血泡的手给乡长看，并说：“我搞不了生产，能不能找一个工作做做”。傅乡长说：“你慢慢搞吧，不久就会锻炼出来的。我再招呼一下生产组长，叫他尽量分配一些轻微农活给你做。再说，像我们这样没有文化的人，就是要找工作，困难更多一些啦！”刘何荣经乡长这样一说，感到很满意，再也没有什么说的了。
    以后，当傅乡长了解到刘何荣需要成立一个家时，他就关照乡妇联主任帮助解决。1956年10月22日，刘何荣同志回乡才半年，便和一个姓熊的姑娘结了婚，婚后，刘的工作、生产更积极了。
    ·他们感到满意·古碑乡在1956年5月前后接收了一批复员军人，其中有六个人缺房子，可是当时正是生产繁忙季节，要把他们房子全部解决，一定要动员一批人工，这样就会影响生产。乡里研究了一下，认为：目前先把急切需要房子的人的房子问题解决，其他待到秋后再说。并决定召开一次复员军人座谈会，说明情况，让他们自己来讨论这件事情。
    在复员军人座谈会上，大家对乡里的意见进行了讨论，一致认为，傅少白同志，一家四口，住着半间房子，实在住不下，需要马上解决，其余的人可以按照乡里的意见缓到秋后再说。
    会议后的第二十五天，傅少白同志需要的两间新草房便盖起来了。
    ·重新积极起来·复员军人陈伦田，担任党支部书记、农业社副社长、治安委员等职务，过去工作很积极。但是在秋季分配以后，他消极了，足足有两个多月未出大门边。这个问题老是在副乡长头脑里打圈子。其实，说起来也很简单：陈伦田自担任各种职务以后，经常要参加各种会议，除了社长会议以外，党支部书记和治安委员会议，社里照例是不记工分的，他因为误工多，一年只做了五十个劳动日，赶到分配时，他只拿到他应得的三块钱。他瞻顾今后生活，怎样不为这件事感到忧愁呢。傅乡长了解了这一情况，和乡里领导上商量后，通过农业社救济他二十五元，并建议乡党委会，解除了他的党支部书记和治安委员职务。从此，人们都看到陈伦田重新积极工作了。
