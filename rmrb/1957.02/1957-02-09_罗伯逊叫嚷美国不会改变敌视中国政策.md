    Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Bloomington: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Walter Robertson emphasized on the evening of the 6th in Bloomington, Illinois, that the U.S. government will not change its hostile policy towards China.

    Robertson delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the Bloomington Chamber of Commerce. In his speech, he slandered China extensively. He said that in the months before the U.S. presidential election last November, there was widespread speculation both inside and outside the United States that once the election was over, the U.S. government's policy of not recognizing Communist China and opposing its entry into the United Nations would change. After the election, these rumors circulated again. But in his view, the U.S. government "has not changed its mind, and there is no reason to expect that we will change our mind."

    Robertson said that he was "extremely disgusted" with the ideology or economic system on which the Beijing government is based, but the U.S. government also has its realistic considerations regarding its policy towards China. He said that the U.S. policy is a "realistic policy based on the interests of the free world itself," and one of the "basic considerations" of this policy is that "recognizing Communist China would virtually mean the collapse of the Republic of China in Taiwan," and the result would be "strategic, moral, and psychological implications" for the U.S. government's struggle against communism in the Far East.

    Robertson emphasized that Taiwan is "a very important link in the island defense chain of the free world in the Pacific," and that the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Taiwan, trained and equipped by the United States, are a "deterrent force" against communism in Asia.

    罗伯逊叫嚷美国不会改变敌视中国政策
    新华社8日讯　伊利诺斯州布鲁明顿消息：美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊6日晚上强调，美国政府不会改变它的敌视中国的政策。
    罗伯逊在布鲁明顿商业协会的年会上发表演说。他在演说里对中国大肆污蔑。他说，在去年11月美国总统选举以前的几个月内，美国内外曾经普遍传说，一旦选举结束，美国政府不承认共产党中国和反对让它进入联合国的政策将会有所改变。在选举以后，这种传说又流传起来。但是在他看来，美国政府“并没有改变主意，而且没有理由预计我们会改变主意”。
    罗伯逊说，他是“极厌恶”北京政府所依据的观念形态或经济制度的，但是美国政府对中国的政策还有它现实的考虑。他说，美国的政策是以“自由世界自己的利益为基础的现实的政策”，这个政策的一个“基本考虑”是，“承认共产党中国实际上就意味着台湾的中华民国垮台”，而结果就会使美国政府在远东反对共产主义的斗争中的“战略、道义和心理上的地位产生种种影响”。
    罗伯逊强调说，台湾是“自由世界在太平洋的岛屿防御锁链中的一个十分重要的环节”，由美国训练和装备起来的台湾蒋介石军队是一支在亚洲反对共产主义的“威慑力量”。
