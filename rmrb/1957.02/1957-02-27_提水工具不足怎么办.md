    What to do if there are insufficient water lifting tools?
    Chang Huamin
    In the farmland irrigation construction movement last year, 4.5 million irrigation wells of various types were dug across the country; these wells all need to be equipped with water lifting tools in order to irrigate the land. However, only more than 700,000 animal-powered waterwheels were installed last year; even with the simple water lifting tools made by agricultural production cooperatives themselves, there were only a little over one million. This means that more than 3.5 million wells do not have water lifting tools. This is a problem that must be solved. The spring irrigation season is approaching, and all regions must take various measures to ensure that these more than 3.5 million wells can be equipped with water lifting tools.
    To develop well irrigation, the state produced 1.8 million animal-powered waterwheels last year, of which more than 700,000 have been sold. There are still about one million waterwheels stored in supply and marketing departments across the country, and they have not been utilized. Leaders and business departments in various regions should seize the time, actively mobilize the masses, and rely on agricultural production cooperatives to raise funds to purchase waterwheels, so that this portion of stored waterwheels can play a role. Last year, some agricultural cooperatives in some regions suffered from natural disasters, had insufficient purchasing power, and urgently needed water lifting tools. Appropriate loan support should be provided to enable them to buy the necessary water lifting tools that need to be added.
    This year, the shortage of water lifting tools is very large. In addition to the planned addition of some new water lifting tools, in areas with a foundation for well irrigation, special attention should be paid to leveraging the potential of existing water lifting equipment. Existing waterwheels and other easily movable water lifting tools should be used on two or three wells, in rotation. In the past, some regions, in order to solve the problem of insufficient water lifting tools and increase the utilization rate of waterwheels, adopted the method of rotating irrigation day and night, achieving "people and horses rest, but the waterwheel doesn't"; and using fast livestock to pull the waterwheel, and slow livestock for other farm work. This method can still be used now. Regions with suitable conditions can also use the method of "collecting water and flowing it far for irrigation" to reduce water lifting equipment and save water for irrigating more land. In some areas with shallow wells and abundant water sources, in order to improve the mechanical efficiency of the tools, some multi-pipe waterwheels can also be modified to increase the water output.
    Last year, some regions, in order to solve the problem of insufficient water lifting tools, mobilized agricultural production cooperatives to use various existing water lifting tools (such as scoops, derricks, windlasses and twin cans, water pumps, bamboo water pumps, pulleys, dragon bone waterwheels, etc.) for irrigation, which played a great role. Some of these have been selected and appraised by local agricultural and water conservancy departments and are considered to be able to be processed and trial-produced by agricultural cooperatives themselves. Shandong, Henan, Liaoning and other provinces have also mobilized agricultural production cooperatives to make and create more than 50 kinds of wooden water lifting tools. These simple water lifting tools can not only irrigate the land in a timely manner, but also save a lot of steel for the country, which is also worth promoting.

    提水工具不足怎么办
    常化民
    去年在兴修农田水利运动中，全国各地打了各种灌溉井四百五十万眼；这些水井都必须安装上提水工具，才能浇地。但是，在去年只安装了七十多万部畜力水车；加上农业生产社自制简便提水工具，也不过一百多万部。这就是说，还有三百五十多万眼井没有提水工具。这是一个必须解决的问题。目前春灌季节就要来到，各地必须采取各种办法，使这三百五十多万眼井都能安装上提水工具。
    为发展水井灌溉，去年国家已经生产了一百八十万部畜力水车，已销售了七十多万部，现在还有一百万部左右的水车存在全国各地供销部门，没有发挥作用。各地领导和业务部门应该抓紧时间，积极发动群众，依靠农业生产社集资购买水车，使这部分积存水车能发挥作用。去年有些地区的农业社因遭受自然灾害，购买力不足又急需提水工具的，应适当给予贷款支持，使它们能买到必须添补的提水工具。
    今年提水工具缺数很大，除了应该有计划地增添一部分新的提水工具以外，在有井灌基础的地区，应特别重视发挥现有各种提水设备的潜力，把现有水车和其他容易搬动的提水工具，一部用到两眼或三眼井上，轮流使用。以往有些地区，为解决提水工具不足的问题，提高水车利用率，曾采取日夜轮浇的办法，作到“歇人歇马，不歇车”；并用快牲口拉水车、慢牲口做其他农活。这种办法现在还可以采用。有条件的地区，还可以用“集水并流远浇”的办法，减少提水工具设备，节省水量多浇地。在一些井浅水源充沛的地区，为提高工具的机械效率，也可以改装一些多管水车，以增加出水量。
    去年有些地区，为解决提水工具不足的问题，曾发动农业生产社利用旧有的各种提水工具（如戽斗、吊杆、轳辘鸳鸯罐、压水唧筒、抽水竹筒、滑车、龙骨水车等）浇地，起了很大作用。其中有些经过当地农业、水利部门选形和鉴定，认为可以由农业社自行加工试制。山东、河南、辽宁等省还发动农业生产社自制并创造了五十来种木质提水工具，这些简单的提水工具既能及时浇地，又为国家节省了不少钢材，这也是值得提倡的。
