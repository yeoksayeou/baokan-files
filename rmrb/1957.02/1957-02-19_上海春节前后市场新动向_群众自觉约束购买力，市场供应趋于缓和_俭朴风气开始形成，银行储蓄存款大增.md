Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 18th. Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhang Jiachi and Xu Shoukeng comment on market trends in Shanghai before and after the Spring Festival.

Before and after the Spring Festival, the more than six million residents of Shanghai held much more cash and savings deposits than in the same period in previous years. If such a large amount of residents' purchasing power were concentrated in the market in a short period of time, it could put considerable pressure on market supply.

But now it seems that this concern is unnecessary. Because government cadres and the military were frugal during the festival, and the general public consciously restrained their purchasing power, the tight market supply situation has eased over the past month. According to the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China's calculations at the end of last year, due to increased residents' income, the amount of currency in circulation in the city increased by 37% compared with the same period of the previous year. The commercial sector then estimated that in the ten days before the Spring Festival, citizens might spend nearly 50 million yuan to purchase New Year goods, and therefore prepared much larger quantities of various non-staple foods than were supplied during last year's Spring Festival. However, even with great efforts in organizing the supply of goods, the total value of the 26 major non-staple foods available for the festival was less than 40 million yuan, but the Spring Festival market was stable and plentiful. According to post-festival accounting, due to the frugality of the residents, most of the non-staple foods had some surplus, and even commodities such as vermicelli, the supply of which was not more than last year, had some left over.

The situation in the daily necessities market was similar. In the month before the festival, the sales volume of 58 daily necessities industries such as department stores and cotton cloth increased compared with the same period last year, but decreased by more than 10% compared with the previous month. The supply situation of some scarce commodities such as wool and yarn has eased; it no longer takes three weeks to a month to tailor clothes in clothing stores. As for expensive or imported goods such as cameras, watches, diamond rings, furniture, and leather goods, sales began to decline normally two months ago, and the downward trend continued before and after the Spring Festival. The largest watch store in the city, the state-owned Third Department Store, sold one-third fewer watches priced above 300 yuan each in December last year than in November; in January this year, the number was one-third less than in December last year.

While there were some signs of easing in the market, the city's residents' savings deposits experienced an extraordinary increase. Before the Spring Festival, relevant departments had predicted that in the last ten days, due to the concentrated purchase of New Year goods by citizens, bank savings deposits might decrease by more than 4 million yuan. But in reality, bank savings not only did not decrease in the last ten days, but increased by 3.88 million yuan. Savings continued to grow after the festival. In the first week after the bank reopened, it received another 2.97 million yuan, bringing the total balance of savings deposits in the city to a new record of 473.1 million yuan. Calculated on the basis of the city's population, each person has savings of as much as 76 yuan.

People believe that the noteworthy new trends shown in Shanghai's market, which has always been very sensitive to the relationship between supply and demand, during this year's Spring Festival, demonstrate that the political awareness of the masses of residents has reached a new height. Due to the impact of long-term economic turmoil before liberation, in the past, whenever the supply of certain commodities in the Shanghai market was tight, there would be blind buying. Some people would squeeze into any line they saw on the road, wanting to buy something, and there was even the strange occurrence of men appearing in the line of women queuing in front of a women's bathhouse to buy bathing tickets. However, before and after this year's Spring Festival, although market supply was still tight, when the Party and the government explained that production development could not keep up with the growth of consumption needs and advocated continuing to promote the spirit of hard work, plain living, and building the country through diligence and thrift, the residents consciously supported it. Many residents paid attention to saving temporarily unnecessary expenses and increasing savings. Some high-income engineers and industrialists and businessmen have opened special savings accounts in banks, preparing to save more money to buy this year's national economic construction bonds. A frugal atmosphere has begun to form in society.

At the same time, people also believe that this new trend is the result of the government's long-term stable economic policies. Over the years, the supply of major necessities in the Shanghai market has been sufficient and prices have been stable, and residents' consumption levels have improved every year. Therefore, people no longer have a fear of the market. Last year, there was a shortage of certain consumer goods, especially high-end goods, in the market. This was due to the improper distribution of some commodities in different regions, and also due to the excessive consumption demands of some residents. According to materials from the Shanghai Municipal Planning and Statistics Department, although the supply was tight last year, the food consumption of citizens still increased by 8% compared with the previous year, clothing consumption increased by 40.8%, and the consumption of other goods increased by 59%. Therefore, this tension reflects a problem of people demanding better and better lives. In this process, consumption has great flexibility.

Judging from various signs, the tight supply of raw materials and some consumer goods in the Shanghai market will continue in the future. Therefore, Shanghai's public opinion unanimously demands to continue promoting the atmosphere of diligence, thrift, and plain living. In the huge consumption of Shanghai's more than six million residents, if each person saves a small portion, it will bring favorable factors to the government in dealing with market issues. Taking the relationship between domestic sales and exports as an example, during the Spring Festival supply period, the Shanghai port completed the task of exporting more than 20,000 pigs as usual, and did not squeeze out export sources due to the tight domestic sales. Guaranteeing and increasing the source of export goods, for the current Shanghai market, can not only exchange for national construction equipment, but also increase the import of necessary consumer goods industrial raw materials, thereby alleviating the tension of certain consumer goods in the domestic market.

### 上海春节前后市场新动向  群众自觉约束购买力，市场供应趋于缓和  俭朴风气开始形成，银行储蓄存款大增

    上海春节前后市场新动向
    群众自觉约束购买力，市场供应趋于缓和
    俭朴风气开始形成，银行储蓄存款大增
    新华社上海18日电　新华社记者张家炽、徐寿铿评述上海春节前后的市场动向。
    春节前后，上海六百多万居民手中，曾握有比往年同时期多得多的现金和储蓄存款。巨大的居民购买力如果在短期内集中投入市场，就可能给市场物资供应带来相当大的压力。
    但现在看来，这种担心是不必要的。由于机关干部和部队俭朴过节，一般居民群众也自觉地约束了自己的购买力，因而市场供应紧张情况在过去的一个多月中反而趋于缓和。据中国人民银行上海市分行在去年年底计算，因居民收入增加，全市货币流通量比前年同期增加了37％。商业部门当时预计，在春节前十天内，市民可能拿出近五千万元的货币来购买年货，因而准备了比去年春节供应量大得多的各种副食品。但即使在组织货源上作了巨大努力，节期应市的二十六种主要副食品的总值还不到四千万元，可是春节市场却过得平稳而丰足。据节后算账，由于居民群众节约，大部分副食品有些积余，甚至供应数量并不比去年多的粉丝等商品也剩下一些。
    日用品市场情况也类似。节前一个月内，百货、棉布等五十八个日用品行业销售量虽比去年节前增加，但同上一个月相比，下降了10％以上。部分紧张商品如呢绒、绒线等，供应情况已有缓和；服装店定制衣服，也不再需要三个星期到一个月的时间。至于照相机、手表、钻戒、家具、皮货这些贵重的或进口的商品，两个月前销量就正常下降，春节前后，下降趋势继续发展。全市最大的钟表商店——国营第三百货商店，去年12月份售出的每只三百元以上的手表数量比11月份减少三分之一；今年1月份又比去年12月份减少三分之一。
    在市场出现某些缓和迹象的同时，全市居民储蓄存款却有超乎常规的增长。春节前有关部门曾经预计，在最后一旬内，因市民集中购买年货，银行储蓄存款可能差出四百多万元。但实际上，银行储蓄在最后十天内不仅没有减少，反而差进三百八十八万元。节后储蓄继续增长，银行开业第一周，又多收进二百九十七万元，而使全市储蓄存款总余额达到四亿七千三百一十万元的新纪录。以全市人口平均计算，每人储存达七十六元之多。
    人们认为，上海这个对供求关系一向十分敏感的市场在今年春节前后所表现的值得注意的新动向，显示出居民群众的政治觉悟有了新的高涨。由于解放前长期经济动荡的影响，过去每当上海市场上某些商品供应紧张时，就会出现盲目争购的现象，有些人在马路上只要看到排队，就挤进去想买点什么，因此曾发生过在女子浴室门前排队买洗澡券的女子队伍中出现了男人的怪事。但今年春节前后，虽然市场供应仍然紧张，但当党和政府说明了生产发展还赶不上消费需要增长的情况而提倡继续发扬艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的精神时，居民群众就自觉地加以支持。许多居民注意节约暂时不必要的开支，增加储蓄。部分收入多的工程师和工商界人士，已在银行中开立储蓄专户，准备节约更多的钱来购买今年的国家经济建设公债。社会上俭朴的风气已开始形成。
    同时人们也认为，这种新动向，是政府长期采取稳定经济政策的结果。历年来，上海市场上主要必需品一直供应充分，价格平稳，居民消费水平每年都有提高。因此人们对市场不再存有恐惧心理。去年市场上一度出现某些消费品，特别是高级商品供应紧张现象，这一方面由于部分商品地区分配不当，另一方面，也由于部分居民群众对消费要求有过高的倾向。据上海市计划统计部门材料，去年供应虽然紧张，但市民吃的仍然比前年增长8％，穿的增长40.8％，用的增长59％。因此，这种紧张，反映了一种人们在生活上要求好和更好的问题。在这中间，消费有很大的伸缩性。
    从各种迹象来看，今后上海市场上原材料和部分消费品的供应紧张状况将继续存在。因此上海社会舆论一致要求继续发扬勤俭朴素的风气。在上海六百多万居民的巨大消费中，如果每人节约很小一部分，就会给政府处理市场问题上带来有利的因素。以内销、外销的关系为例，在春节供应期间，上海口岸照常完成了出口两万多头猪的任务，并未因内销紧张而挤掉出口货源。出口货源的保证和增加，对当前上海的市场来说，不仅可以换回国家建设器材，还可以增加必需的消费品工业原材料进口，从而又可缓和国内市场某些消费品的紧张情况。
