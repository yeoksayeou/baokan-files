    Hunan and Liangshan Cultivate a Batch of
    Minority Agricultural Society Accountants
    (Our Dispatch) The more than two hundred accounting staff members of various minority nationalities from Hunan Province in the Agricultural Cooperative Accounting Cadre Training Class of the South-Central Institute for Nationalities, having studied for half a year, graduated in January.
    Among these students, 70% are not only competent for the work of chief accountant in advanced agricultural cooperatives but can also take on leadership roles within mutual aid networks; the rest are all capable of serving as chief or assistant accountants in advanced cooperatives. These students include members of the Miao, Dong, Yao, and Hui ethnic groups.
    These students received meticulous care from the Party and the government: the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture allocated more than 4,000 yuan to the counties to specifically address their families' living difficulties.
    After receiving their graduation certificates, the students returned to various parts of Hunan. They are full of confidence in doing a good job of accounting. (Liang Yuanxing)
    (Another Dispatch) Liangshan area has cultivated the first batch of Yi accountants in history. Beginning in July last year, the Liangshan Nationalities Cadre School selected forty students to study accounting. After seven months of hard study, these students have completed their studies in the new Yi language, arithmetic, abacus, and accounting. As they are about to graduate, they are all reporting the good news to their Ata (fathers), Ama (mothers), and Ximo (wives) at home with great joy. Seven months ago, these accountants were all children who had just been liberated from the slave system. They were sallow and thin, wearing sackcloth trousers and tattered felt jackets, and were illiterate. Some people could not even count their fingers and toes during the entrance examination, but now they have become a new type of technically knowledgeable person among the Yi people. (Xiong Pengye)

    湖南和凉山培养出一批
    少数民族农业社会计
    本报讯　在中南民族学院农业合作会计干部训练班的湖南省二百多个各少数民族会计员，学习半年，已经在1月间毕业。
    这批学员中，有70％的人不但能胜任高级农业社的主管会计工作，而且还能担任互助网的领导工作；其余的人也全部能担当高级社的主管会计和助理会计的工作。这批学员包括苗、侗、瑶、回等民族。
    这批学员受了党和政府无微不至的照顾：湘西苗族自治州为学员拨了四千多元发到各县，专门解决他们的家庭生活困难。
    学员们领得毕业证明书后，都分别回到湖南各地。他们满怀信心去搞好会计工作。　（梁远兴）
    又讯　凉山地区已经培养出有史以来第一批彝族会计员。从去年7月开始，凉山民族干部学校即从学员当中抽调四十人学习会计。经过七个月的刻苦学习，这批学员已经学完了新彝文、算术、珠算和会计学。在即将毕业的时候，他们都以万分高兴的心情给家里的阿打（父亲）阿妈、喜摩（妻子）报喜讯。在七个月以前，这批会计员都是刚从奴隶制度下解放出来的娃子。他们面黄肌瘦，穿着麻布裤，披着破毡衫，一字不识，有一些人在入学考试时连手脚的指姆都数不清，现在都成了彝族人民中新型的、有技术知识的人了。　（熊鹏业）
