Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 10th: According to Cairo newspapers, the Italian oil tanker "Pionetta," with a tonnage of over 2,600 tons, entered the Suez Canal on February 9th after passing through Port Said. This is the first merchant ship to enter the canal since it was closed to navigation last autumn due to the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt.

    The "Pionetta" was guided into the canal by Egyptian pilots. It anchored at the 61-kilometer mark that evening, preparing to set sail for Port Suez on February 10th.

    The "Pionetta" is employed by the Egyptian government to transport oil from Port Said to the Egyptian oil refinery in Port Suez.

    Shipping experts say this small ship is able to navigate around the few remaining obstacles in the canal that have not yet been cleared.

    第一艘商船驶入苏伊士运河
    据新华社开罗10日电　据开罗报纸报道，二千六百多吨的意大利油船“皮昂内塔”号在2月9日通过塞得港驶入苏伊士运河。自从去年秋天由于英法侵略埃及苏伊士运河停止通航以后，这是进入运河的第一艘商船。
    “皮昂内塔”号是由埃及引水员引导进入运河的。它当天晚上停泊在六十一公里处，准备在2月10日启碇驶往苏伊士港。
    “皮昂内塔”号受雇为埃及政府把石油从塞得港运往苏伊士港的埃及炼油厂。
    航运专家们说，这艘小船是能够绕过运河上剩下的少数还没有清除的障碍物的。
