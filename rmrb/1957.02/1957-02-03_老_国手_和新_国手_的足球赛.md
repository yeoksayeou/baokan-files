Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 2nd. A football match that caused a sensation in Shanghai was held here on the 1st. A mixed team composed of famous Chinese football players from more than a decade ago played a friendly match against the Beijing Youth Football Team at Hongkou Stadium. The youth team won two to zero.

　　That day, although it was raining heavily, more than 16,000 spectators still put on raincoats and held umbrellas to watch the game.

　　The members of the mixed team included Sun Jinshun and Jia Youliang, who participated in the 1936 Olympic Games; Gao Baozheng, who participated in the 1948 Olympic Games; Zhang Banglun, a famous goalkeeper who participated in the 1948 and 1952 Olympic Games; Zhang Jie and He Jiatong, who participated in the 1952 Olympic Games; and Wu Qixiang, the "Iron Gate" – a defender who was famous in the football world many years ago. Before this match, they had defeated the Nanjing Air Defense Force Team and the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant Team, the champion of the Shanghai Football League last autumn, with scores of 4-2 and 3-1 respectively.

　　Among the eleven athletes who played for the Beijing Youth Team this time, in addition to the famous goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu and eight other national players, the other three players were members of the Beijing Sports University football team who had just returned from a visit to Albania.

　　The game began. Fifteen minutes later, the Beijing Youth Team organized an attack. Left inside forward Zhang Shuihao received the ball from center forward Yuan Daolun. He made a feint and passed the ball to Chen Shanhu, who was rushing in from the right. Chen Shanhu chipped the ball, and Zhang Banglun rushed out of the goal but missed. The ball fell at Zhang Shuihao's feet again. Zhang kicked it lightly, and the ball entered the net. At this time, the audience burst into warm applause.

　　After that, the Beijing Youth Team changed its strategy. The five forwards often used the "cross-passing" tactic to open up the opponent's dense defensive line, and it worked at thirty-six minutes. Beijing Youth Team's right inside forward Wang Liwei passed the ball to Chen Shanhu, who dribbled past the opponent's defender Wu Qixiang and shot at the goal from 14 meters away. The ball rolled straight into the net from under Zhang Banglun's feet, and the Beijing Youth Team took a 2-0 lead.

　　In the second half, the mixed team replaced some players. Due to physical reasons, they adopted a dense defensive approach, often using four to six players to defend in the penalty area, which blocked the Beijing Youth Team's fast, central breakthrough attack. Although the Beijing Youth Team launched many attacks in the second half, Wu Qixiang, Gao Baozheng, and others defended well, so the 2-0 record was maintained until the end of the game.

    老“国手”和新“国手”的足球赛
    据新华社上海2日电　1日在这里举行了一场轰动上海市的足球赛。十多年前的我国足球名将组成的混合队同北京青年足球队在虹口体育场举行了一场友谊比赛。青年队以二比零获胜。
    这天，虽然下着大雨。但是，仍旧有一万六千多观众披了雨衣打着雨伞前去观战。
    混合队的队员中有参加过1936年奥林匹克运动会的选手孙锦顺、贾幼良，参加过1948年奥林匹克运动会的选手高保正，参加过1948年和1952年奥林匹克运动会的选手、著名的守门员张邦纶，参加过1952年奥林匹克运动会的张杰、何家统，以及多年前驰名球坛的“铁闸”——后卫吴祺祥等。在这次比赛以前，他们曾以四比二和三比一的比数，分别战胜过南京防空兵部队队和去年秋季上海市足球联赛冠军——上海钢铁一厂队。
    北京青年队这次上场的十一名运动员中，除了著名的守门员张俊秀等八名是国家选手外，其他三名队员是刚从阿尔巴尼亚访问归国的北京体育学院足球队的队员。
    球赛开始了。十五分钟后，北京青年队组织进攻，左内锋张水浩得到中锋袁道伦传来的球，他作了一个假动作将球传给从右边赶上的陈山虎，陈山虎将球一挑，张邦纶跑出门外扑了一空，球又落在张水浩脚下，张轻轻一踢，球进入网内，这时候观众中发出了热烈掌声。
    以后，北京青年队改变了战略，五个前锋经常用“交叉传递”的战术，来拉开对方密集的防御线，到了三十六分时，果然生效。北京青年队右内锋王立惟把球传给陈山虎，陈山虎带球越过对方后卫吴祺祥，在门前十四公尺处射门，球从张邦纶脚下直滚入网，北京青年队以二比零领先。
    下半场比赛，混合队更换了部分队员，由于体力关系，他们采取了密集防守的办法，在禁区里经常用四到六个队员来防守，这样就阻挡了北京青年队快速的、中央突破的进攻。北京青年队虽然在下半场接连发动了很多次进攻，但是混合队的吴祺祥、高保正等守卫得很好，因此使二比零的纪录保持到终场。
