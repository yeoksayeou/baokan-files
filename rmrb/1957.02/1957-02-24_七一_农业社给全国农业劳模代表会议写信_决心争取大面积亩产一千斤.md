Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd. The "July 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, is using the goal of achieving a yield of 1,000 jin per mu on 1,200 mu of land this year as a gift to the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference.

The members of this cooperative wrote a letter to the national agricultural labor models' representatives on the 18th. The letter stated: After the cooperative's representative, Pu Zhongzhi, came to Beijing to attend the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, the members, based on the specific conditions of the cooperative, seriously discussed, studied, and formulated the cooperative's high-yield plan. This year, the cooperative will strive to achieve 1,000 jin per mu on 1,200 mu of land, including 100 mu of single-crop rice at 1,000 jin per mu, 100 mu of corn at 1,000 jin per mu, and a 1,000-jin production team with a cultivated area of 500 mu. The goal is for the average grain yield of the entire cooperative to reach 700 jin per mu.

The letter also stated that they have many favorable conditions for completing this plan. In addition to the early start of spring production this year, the cooperative cadres having leadership experience, and the members having a habit of collective production, when Pu Zhongzhi returns to the cooperative from Beijing, he will surely bring them the production and work experience of many fraternal cooperatives for them to learn and promote. With these favorable conditions, as long as they listen to the Party, they will definitely be able to overcome the difficulties in their work and achieve a great harvest.

    “七一”农业社给全国农业劳模代表会议写信
    决心争取大面积亩产一千斤
    新华社西安23日电　陕西省长安县“七一”农业社以今年争取一千二百亩地亩产一千斤作为向全国农业劳动模范代表会议的献礼。
    这个社的全体社员在18日向全国农业劳动模范代表写了一封信。信上说：这个社的代表蒲忠智来北京参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议后，社员们又根据社里的具体情况，经过认真的讨论研究制订了全社的丰产计划。今年全社争取一千二百亩田地达到千斤亩，其中单一作物水稻千斤亩一百亩，玉米千斤亩一百亩，另外还有一个耕地面积五百亩的千斤生产队。争取全社粮食产量平均每亩达到七百斤。
    信上还说：他们完成这个计划有很多有利的条件。除了今年春季生产动手早、社干部有了领导经验和社员有了集体生产的习惯等以外，蒲忠智由北京回社的时候，一定还会带给他们许多兄弟社的生产和工作经验，供他们学习和推广。有了这些有利条件，只要听党的话，他们一定可以克服工作中的困难，取得大丰收。
