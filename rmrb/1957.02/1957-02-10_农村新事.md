New Developments in the Countryside

　　The Happy Later Years of a Centenarian

　　Cai Ai, a member of the Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative in Banzai Township, Pinghe County, Fujian Province, is 108 years old this year. Since the death of her husband, children, and grandchildren in 1888, this centenarian has lived a lonely and miserable life. Eight years ago (at the age of 100), she still used a hoe to patrol the fields and release water. After liberation, this elderly woman received the respect and care of the Party, the government, and the people. During the high tide of agricultural cooperation last year, the local agricultural cooperative admitted her as a member. Not long ago, this "centenarian" began to enjoy the "Five Guarantees" treatment. The cooperative provides her with 30 catties of rice, 2.5 yuan for vegetables, two sets of clothes a year, and as much firewood and charcoal as she needs every month. The production team leader, Lai Zhenzong, has been assigned to deliver rice, buy vegetables, oil, and salt for her, and her grand-niece, Lin Wuzhao, has been assigned to carry water for her. From then on, this elderly woman, who had lost her ability to work and lived a lonely life for many years, is no longer lonely and can spend her remaining years in peace without worrying about food and clothing.　　　　　·Sun Dexian·
　　
      Aunt Zhao’s Worry

　　On December 25th last year, members of the Huoguang Agricultural Cooperative in Wangcheng Township, Laixi County, Shandong Province, were working hard. Zhao Renfang, an elderly woman from the 14th team, couldn't participate in the collective labor of the cooperative because she couldn't see clearly. She sat on the kang and calculated that after joining the advanced cooperative, she would receive a full share of corn, rice, millet... How wonderful that is...
　　
    Suddenly, Aunt Renfang remembered a worry that had been bothering her for days. The more she thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt, always feeling that she had let the cooperative down and let everyone down. So she ran to the home of production team leader Li Renxun and told the captain her worry breathlessly.

　　It turned out to be like this: In November, in order to deliver enough grain to the state in time, the cooperative asked all members to shell peanuts. Aunt Renfang also shelled one hundred catties. Her husband, Li Baoxin, saw the plump and full peanuts and picked out ten catties of large ones and added ten catties of small ones. Aunt Renfang tried to dissuade him at the time, but it was no use.
　　
    After Aunt Renfang finished speaking, she breathed a sigh of relief and told the captain, "I've told you, you can educate him so that he will never do this again, and I can rest assured."

    农村新事
    百岁老人的幸福晚年
    福建省平和县坂仔乡团结农业社社员蔡爱，今年已经一百零八岁了。这位百岁老人，自从1888年她的丈夫、儿女去世以后，就是一个人过着孤苦的生活。八年前（一百岁的时候）她还拿着锄头到田里去巡水放水。解放以后，这位老人受到了党、政府和人民的尊敬和照顾。在去年农业合作化高潮中当地农业社吸收了她入社。不久前，这位“百岁老人”开始享受了“五保”待遇，社里每月给她大米三十斤、菜钱两元五角，衣服一年两套，柴炭要多少有多少；还指定了生产小队长赖振宗替她送米、买菜、油、盐，她的侄孙女林乌枣替她挑水。从此，这位已经丧失了劳动力、常年过着孤苦生活的老人，不再是孤苦的了，而可以安度晚年，不再愁吃愁穿了。　　　　　·孙德籼·
      赵大娘的心事
    去年12月25日这一天，山东莱西县旺城乡火光农业社的社员在紧张地劳动着。第十四队的赵仁芳老大娘，因眼睛看不清东西，不能参加社的集体劳动，便自己坐在炕上，盘算着入了高级社以后，玉米、稻谷、黍子……样样都分了个齐全。这有多好啊……。
    突然，仁芳大娘又想起了多日闷在心里的一件心事。她越想越难受，总觉着对不起社，对不起大伙。于是她便跑到了生产队长李仁训的家里，上气不接下气地向队长说出了自己的心事。
    原来是这样一回事：在11月间，社里为了及时交足公粮，便让社员们家家户户一齐剥花生。仁芳大娘也剥了一百斤。她老伴李保欣看到又肥又胖的颗粒饱满的花生，就把大粒的拣出十斤，另外添上了十斤小粒的。仁芳大娘当时虽劝阻他，但也没管用。
    仁芳大娘说完后松了口气，并告诉队长说：“我和您说了，您可以教育他，永远不要这样了，我也好放心。”
