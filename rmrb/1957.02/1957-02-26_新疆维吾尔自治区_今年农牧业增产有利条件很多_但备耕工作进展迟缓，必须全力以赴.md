Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, February 25th: The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region held its Sixth Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Production Conference to discuss how to achieve this year's production increase plan.

    After studying last year's agricultural and animal husbandry production situation, the meeting proposed that the total grain output of the region this year should reach 4.6 billion jin, an increase of 10.3% over last year; the total cotton output should reach more than 130 million jin; the total output of oil crops should reach 212.6 million jin; and the number of livestock should increase by a net 9% compared with last year.

    The meeting studied the conditions for achieving this year's production increase plan. At present, the agricultural areas in the region have basically achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization, and the number of pastoral households joining animal husbandry cooperatives accounts for more than 24% of the total number of pastoral households. The autonomous region has unlimited potential in increasing yield per unit area and expanding cultivated land area. Xinjiang is short of rain and relies on irrigation. According to the water source surveys in various places, the utilization rate of water sources is currently less than 50% of the flow rate. It is entirely possible for agricultural cooperatives to organize small-scale land reclamation, averaging 140 mu of wasteland reclaimed per cooperative. Simply merging plots, reducing field ridges and corners, and filling in old ditches can increase the sowing area of general farmland.

    The promotion of new-style farm tools is also a potential for increasing production in Xinjiang. This year, the autonomous region will promote more than 49,000 new-style farm tools. Together with the existing new-style farm tools, most of the land in Xinjiang can be cultivated using new farm tools.

    The agricultural production upsurge in the autonomous region last year cultivated more than 60,000 core members, agricultural technicians, water conservancy workers, and new farm tool operators for agricultural cooperatives. Large areas of high-yield fields have appeared in many places. The meeting believes that on the basis of summarizing last year's experiences and lessons, continuing to promote effective agricultural technologies and reforms of the cropping system is also an important factor in striving for a good agricultural harvest this year.

    The meeting believes that the basic key to completing the livestock production increase plan lies in steadily carrying out the animal husbandry production increase movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation. The people's committees at all levels in the autonomous region must strengthen leadership over the animal husbandry in agricultural areas, which accounts for more than 70% of the total number of livestock in the autonomous region.

    The meeting pointed out that spring plowing is approaching, but the preparatory work in various places is lagging behind. The accumulation of fertilizer, the construction of water conservancy projects and other main aspects are not as good as last year, and there is also less snow accumulation in winter. Therefore, the meeting requested that the agricultural and animal husbandry production departments at all levels in the autonomous region organize and mobilize all forces to make spring plowing production an urgent task that overrides all other work.

    More than 300 responsible cadres from autonomous prefectures and special districts of the autonomous region, as well as responsible cadres from relevant departments and bureaus of the autonomous region such as agriculture, forestry, water, and animal husbandry, participated in the meeting. The meeting lasted for ten days and closed on the 22nd.

    新疆维吾尔自治区
    今年农牧业增产有利条件很多
    但备耕工作进展迟缓，必须全力以赴
    新华社乌鲁木齐25日电　新疆维吾尔自治区召开第六届农牧业生产会议，讨论怎样实现今年的增产计划。
    会议研究了去年的农牧业生产情况后，提出今年全区粮食总产量计划达到四十六亿斤，比去年增产10.3％；棉花总产量达到一亿三千多万斤；油料作物总产量达到两亿一千二百六十万斤；牲畜比去年净增9％。
    会议研究了实现今年增产计划的条件。目前全区农业地区已基本实现高级农业合作化，牧区加入畜牧业合作社的也占到总牧户的24％以上。自治区在提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积上都有着无限的潜力。新疆缺雨，依赖灌溉。根据各地水源调查，目前水源的利用率还不到流量的50％。农业社组织小型开荒，平均每社开垦一百四十亩荒地是完全有可能的。一般农田仅合并地块、缩小地埂、地角、填平旧渠，还可以增加不少的播种面积。
    推广新式农具也是新疆增产的一项潜力。今年自治区将推广新式农具四万九千多件，加上原有的新式农具，新疆大部分土地可以使用新农具耕作。
    自治区去年一年的农业生产高潮，已为农业社培养出六万多名骨干、农业技术员、水利员、新农具手。不少地方都出现了大面积的丰产田。会议认为在总结去年经验与教训的基础上，继续推广行之有效的农业技术和耕作制度的改革，也是争取今年农业丰收的重要因素。
    会议认为，完成牲畜增产计划的基本关键在于稳步地开展以互助合作为中心的畜牧业增产运动，对于占自治区牲畜总头数70％以上的农业地区的畜牧业，自治区各级人民委员会必须加强领导。
    会议指出：目前春耕临近，但是各地备耕工作迟缓，在积肥、兴修水利等主要方面还赶不上去年，冬季积雪也较少。因此，会议要求自治区各级农牧业生产部门，组织和动员一切力量，把春耕生产作为当前压倒一切工作的紧急任务。
    参加这次会议的有自治区各自治州、专区的负责干部以及自治区农、林、水、畜牧等有关厅、局的负责干部三百多人。会议共进行十天，已在22日闭幕。
