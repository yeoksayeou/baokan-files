According to "People's Railway" news: The preliminary survey design proposal for the Chengdu-Kunming Railway, which is 1,050 kilometers long, has been completed by the Second Design Institute.

    In order to determine technical principles and select good plans, the designers analyzed and sorted out more than 3,000 kilometers of data. During the process of analyzing the data, a new calculation method for operating costs was adopted. The economically reasonable range curves with limiting gradients of 6‰ and 12‰ from Xichang to Dashaba were drawn, and the traffic capacity adaptation curves were also drawn. This shows the comparison of transportation capacity and limiting gradients in various periods, thus saving more than 1,000 kilometers of preliminary survey. The overall budget of the entire line has been shortened by 120 kilometers for the main line compared to the original Chengdu-Kunming western line, reducing tunnels by 30 kilometers, which can reduce investment by 200 million yuan.

    成昆铁路完成草测设计
    据“人民铁道”讯　全长一千零五十公里的成昆铁路的草测设计意见书，已经由第二设计院编制完成。
    为了确定技术原则问题，选择良好的方案，设计人员分析和整理了三千多公里的资料，在分析资料的过程中，采用了运营费新的计算方法，绘了西昌至大沙坝限制坡度6％和12％经济合理范围曲线，又绘了运量适应曲线，这样就可以看出各年代运输能力和限制坡度的比较，因此可以节省一千多公里的初测。全线概算比原成昆西线缩短了正线一百二十公里，减少了隧道三十公里，可以减少投资二亿元。
