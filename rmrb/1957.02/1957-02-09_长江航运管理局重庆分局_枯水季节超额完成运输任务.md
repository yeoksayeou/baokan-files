    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration actively overcame the difficulties of insufficient shipping capacity on the Sichuan River during the dry season and exceeded its January transportation target by 26%.
    Since the beginning of this year, the shipping department, based on the new channel conditions after the regulation of the Sichuan River, has lowered the water level requirements for towing double barges in the dry season, allowing double barges to be towed as usual at water levels that previously only allowed single barges. At the same time, the load capacity of 700-ton barges has also increased from 500 tons in the previous dry season to over 600 tons this year. Many passenger and cargo ships that were originally not allowed to tow barges have also towed barges during this year's dry season.

    枯水季节超额完成运输任务
    据新华社讯　长江航运管理局重庆分局积极克服枯水季节川江运力不足的困难，超额26％完成了1月份的运输任务。
    航运部门今年以来根据川江整治以后的航道新情况，降低了枯水季节拖双驳的水位规定，使原来只能拖单驳的水位，照常拖双驳。同时，七百吨驳船的载量也由上一个枯水季节的五百吨提高到今年的六百吨以上。许多原来规定不拖驳船的客货轮，在今年的枯水季节里也都拖了驳船。
