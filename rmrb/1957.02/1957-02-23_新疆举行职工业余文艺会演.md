Xinjiang Holds Staff and Workers' Amateur Art Performance

(Our Dispatch) The colorful first Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Staff and Workers' Amateur Art Performance was held in Urumqi on February 12th. Workers and staff from eighteen counties and cities, as well as six industrial and mining enterprises, participated in this performance, including those from the Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Manchu, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups. Since liberation, Xinjiang has fostered a contingent of ethnic minority workers. The multi-talented workers of various ethnic groups have formed many amateur troupes and created many programs. Their performances of ethnic operas such as "Idle at Home" and "Singing of Karamay" were well-received by the workers.

    新疆举行职工业余文艺会演
    本报讯　丰富多采的新疆维吾尔自治区第一届职工业余文艺会演于2月12日在乌鲁木齐举行。参加这次会演的有十八个县、市和六个工、矿企业的工人和职员，其中包括维吾尔、哈萨克、乌孜别克、满、蒙古等民族。新疆自解放以来，成长了一支民族工人队伍，能歌善舞的各族职工组成了许多业余剧团，并创作了许多节目。这次他们演出民族歌剧“闲在家里”，“歌唱克拉玛依”等，很受职工们的欢迎。
