American Newspapers Discuss the Trend of Economic Decline in the United States
Wu Ming

Recently, American newspapers have expressed concern about the prospects of the U.S. economy. They believe that the U.S. economy developed to a very high level, even somewhat excessively, in 1956, and many unfavorable phenomena have accumulated. Therefore, this year needs to "brake" and strive for a "breathing space."

The "U.S. News & World Report," published on February 1, pointed out: "In the new year, things will not be as smooth as they were in the old year... In other words, prosperity is about to decline... Demand for many goods will be less than expected." "Business Week" also said: "The reason that economic depression was avoided in 1955 was because of increased consumer spending, and the reason it was avoided in 1956 was because of massive capital investment. But in 1957, these rising factors have disappeared, so it mainly relies on government spending." "Commercial Daily" said: "Weaknesses in the economy are now greater than they were a year ago."

According to discussions in some American newspapers, the following three "weaknesses" currently exist in the U.S. economy: First, in recent years, especially in 1956, investment in new plants and equipment has surged, resulting in a significant surplus of productivity. Second, the rise in consumer credit has reached unprecedented heights, and people's future purchasing power will become increasingly limited. Third, government spending has maintained huge figures in recent years since the war, exacerbating the risk of inflation. Due to these reasons, investment has recently shown signs of contraction. According to a report in the "Wall Street Journal" on January 24, General Motors and General Electric have both reduced their plans for new factory expansions. General Motors has decided to postpone the construction of two new assembly plants, while General Electric has postponed the construction of four plants. At the same time, orders for machine tools have also been reduced. According to the "National Machine Tool Builders' Association," new machine tool orders in December last year amounted to only $57.1 million, a decrease of $9.2 million compared to October. The "Wall Street Journal" also stated on January 24: "Some machine tool manufacturers expect the reduction in new orders to continue." Another sign is the trend of reduced residential construction. Residential construction last year was reduced by about 16% compared to 1955. Due to the high interest rates hindering residential construction and sales, experts on residential construction predict that residential construction will be reduced by another 20% this year, according to the "Wall Street Journal." Associated Press reporter Walter Breed's report on February 17 also stated that private housing construction in the United States in January this year had fallen to its lowest point in five years, with only 62,000 units. In addition, production plans for other sectors, including the textile industry and the television industry, have also been reduced. According to a report in the "Wall Street Journal" on January 28: "Textile factories across the country have begun to quietly reduce production. Production has been reduced in some textile factories in the North and South, including the production of machine tools, reduced working days, and sometimes short-term shutdowns... These reductions are not enough to affect the entire industry, but there is a possibility of expansion." Although the situation in the automotive industry has improved due to better sales in January, and production increased in mid-February, this growth occurred after the output of automobiles in the first four weeks of this year decreased by 31,000 vehicles compared to the same period last year. The reduction in the automotive industry at the beginning of the year also affected the ferrous metallurgy industry, as one-fifth of its products are used in the production of automobiles. According to "Business Week" on January 22, steel companies have not received orders from companies that produce automobiles and their parts as they had hoped.

In addition, due to the decrease in demand for certain goods, industrialists and businessmen have reduced their interest in increasing inventory. The overall business inventory is currently 7% higher than at the end of 1955. At the same time, stock market prices have been unstable since the beginning of this year. According to the Dow Jones Index, the average price index of industrial company stocks was 495.51 on January 10 this year, but fell to 480.53 on January 30. On February 5 and 11, the New York Stock Market experienced consecutive sharp declines. Although there was a rebound on February 13, raising the total value of stocks by $2.2 billion, it was only equivalent to half the value of the previous two declines. "U.S. News & World Report" believes that this volatility in the stock market is due to the "instability" of the overall economic situation.

Due to the above indications, figures in the U.S. economic community are already predicting a downward trend in the U.S. economy this year. For example, the monthly report of "Insurance Trust Company," belonging to the Morgan Group, warned that the "possibility of a downward trend occurring within this year" should not be ignored. Ray Aielson, an economist at "Bankers Trust Company," also pointed out in a speech on January 23 that it can be expected that there will be an "adjustment" or "even a decline in commercial activity."

    美报谈论美国经济下降的趋势
    吴明
    最近，美国报刊对美国经济的前景纷纷表示不安。他们认为：1956年美国经济已经发展得很高，甚至有些过头，出现了许多积累起来的不良现象。因此今年需要“刹车”，争取一个“喘息的时间”。
    2月1日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”指出：“在新的一年中，事情将不如在老的一年中处于那样顺利的状况……换言之，繁荣即将减退……对许多货物的需求将比预期的要少。”“商业周刊”也说：“1955年所以能够避免经济萧条是因为消费者支出增加，而1956年又能避免，是因为大量的资本投资。但在1957年，这些上升因素都消灭了，因而主要依靠政府支出”。“商务日报”说：“经济中的弱点现在比一年前增加了”。
    根据美国一些报刊的论述，美国经济中目前存在着下列三个“弱点”：一、近年来，特别是1956年，新厂房和设备的投资激增，造成生产力的显著过剩。二、消费者信贷的上升已经达到空前的高度，人民未来的购买力将愈加有限。三、战后历年来政府开支都维持庞大数字，加重了通货膨胀的危险。由于这些原因，最近以来，投资已经出现缩减的迹象。据1月24日“华尔街日报”透露：通用汽车公司和通用电气公司都已削减了他们新的扩建工厂的计划。通用汽车公司已决定推迟建筑两座新的装配工厂，通用电气公司则推迟了建筑四座工厂的工程。同时，车床的订货也有削减。据“全国车床制造商协会”称：去年12月份新的车床订货仅达五千七百一十万美元，较10月份减少九百二十万美元。1月24日“华尔街日报”并称：“某些车床制造商预料，新订货的减少还将继续”。另一个迹象是住宅建筑的削减趋势。去年住宅建筑约比1955年削减了16％。由于高额的利率对住宅的建筑和销售产生了阻碍的作用，据“华尔街日报”报道：住宅建筑问题专家预料住宅建筑在今年内将再减少20％。美联社记者华尔特·布里德2月17日的报道也说，今年1月份美国私人房屋建筑已下降到五年以来的最低点，只有六万二千所。此外，其他一系列部门，包括纺织工业和电视工业的生产计划，也有削减。据1月28日“华尔街日报”报道：“全国的纺织工厂都已开始悄悄地削减生产。在北方和南方的某些纺织工厂中都削减了生产，包括车床的生产、缩减工作日，有时并短期地停工……这些削减还不足以影响整个工业，但存在着扩大的可能性”。汽车工业的情况虽然由于1月份销售情况较好，2月中旬生产有了增加，但是这种增长是继今年头四个星期汽车的产量较去年同期减少了三万一千辆之后的情况出现的。汽车工业在年初的削减也影响到了黑色冶金工业，因为这一工业的五分之一产品是用于生产汽车的。据1月22日“商业周刊”指出：熔钢公司没有得到他们所指望的生产汽车及其零件的公司的订货。
    此外，由于某些货物需求的减少，工商业家对增加存货的兴趣也减少了。而目前整个商业存货已比1955年底高了7％。同时，股票行情今年以来也出现了不稳定的情况。据道·琼斯指数，今年1月10日工业公司的股票价格平均指数为495.51，到了1月30日就下降为480.53。在2月5日和11日，纽约股票市场曾连续大跌价，虽然到2月13日又有回升，把股票总价值抬高了二十二亿美元，但也只相当于上两次下跌价值的一半。“美国新闻与世界报道”认为，股票行情的这种动荡不定，乃是由于整个经济状况的“不稳定”所致。
    由于上述种种迹象，美国经济界人物已在预测今年美国经济将有下降趋势。例如，属于摩根集团的“保险信托公司”的月报曾警告说：不应该忽视“这样的可能性，即在今年之内将发生下降的趋势”。“银行家信托公司”的经济学家雷艾尔逊也在1月23日演说中指出：可以预料到会进行“调整”或“甚至可能发生商业活跃的下降”。
