    Impressions of Watching the Han Opera "Stealing the Chicken"
    Dà Kē
    The same opera from the same genre, due to the creative labor of different actors, often presents many different "approaches" in performance. These different artistic treatments meet the diverse requirements of audiences with various preferences and tastes. Especially when the same opera is performed in different genres, many aspects, from the script to the performance, differ greatly. It should be said that this also embodies the rich and colorful nature of Chinese opera art.
    Not long ago, at the first Hubei Provincial Opera Observation and Performance Conference, I saw a traditional Han opera called "Stealing the Chicken," performed by the Hubei Provincial Direct Delegation. "Stealing the Chicken" is adapted from the story of Shi Qian stealing a chicken in the 46th chapter of "Water Margin," "Sick Guan Suo Makes a Scene at Emerald Screen Mountain,拼命三火 Burns Zhu Family Shop." Peking Opera has this play, called "Clever Chain," which is a signature play of the famous actor Ye Shengzhang and his student Zhang Chunhua. In "Clever Chain," Shi Qian fully teases the evil shopkeeper of the Zhu Family Village. The actor skillfully uses many superb martial arts skills of Peking Opera to express the unique character of this "Drumming Rat." This is a good play. However, "Stealing the Chicken," performed by the Hubei Provincial Direct Delegation, differs greatly from "Clever Chain" from the script to the performance. "Stealing the Chicken" has a scene where Shi Qian meets Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu on the road. Shi Qian asks Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu to introduce him to Liangshan, but Shi Xiu dislikes his tattered clothes. Shi Qian immediately steals the crown and belt from the Buddha statue in the temple and puts them on. This detail is a kind of well-intentioned little mockery of Shi Xiu, which also caused laughter from the audience (this plot also exists in the miscellaneous drama "Lodging" and "Stealing the Chicken" selected in the opera collection "Zhui Bai Qiu" published during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty). However, the Peking Opera "Clever Chain" does not have this scene. The character of the Zhu Family Shop shopkeeper is also different in the Han opera and Peking Opera. In "Stealing the Chicken," the shopkeeper is a bit clever and always wants to deceive the skilled Shi Qian. In "Clever Chain," more emphasis is placed on his irritability and snobbishness. In terms of martial arts, Zhao Kefei, the Han opera actor who plays Shi Qian in "Stealing the Chicken," showed a considerable level of accomplishment. His falls, tumbles, flips, and leaps are accurate and neat, which perfectly shapes Shi Qian's alert and humorous character. In terms of basic skills, it can be said that there is no difference from Peking Opera, but in specific application, it is completely different from the dance design of "Clever Chain." In terms of "singing," Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu in the Peking Opera play sing "Da Zi Pai Zi," while the Han opera sings "Si Ping Diao." The Peking Opera play also has a scene at the end where Shi Qian and others fight with the "Chicken King" of Zhu Family Village; the Han opera does not have this scene.
    In today's situation where there is disregard for the performance characteristics of the original genre and the method of rigidly transplanting other genres is used, it is particularly interesting to see several performances of the same play with different treatments. Once, I visited the Hubei Provincial Han Opera Troupe and asked Comrade Zhao Kefei, the actor who played "Stealing the Chicken," whether he had watched the Peking Opera "Clever Chain" by Comrade Ye Shengzhang or Zhang Chunhua. Comrade Zhao Kefei said that he had not had the opportunity to watch it. In fact, I think that as long as it is not rigidly applied and imitated, mutual observation and learning are also necessary.
    Recently, in the work of sorting out traditional opera repertoires, there is often a practice of "adding ideology." Some people do not enrich and improve based on the development logic of the historical figures' characters themselves in the original work; instead, they rigidly add or delete something, attempting to make the characters in the original work more vivid and the theme of the play more elevated, but the effect is counterproductive. This is also a simplistic approach.
    From the perspective of the entire script sorting work, the Han opera "Stealing the Chicken" is well sorted, and Shi Qian's character is also portrayed quite accurately and vividly; however, at the end of the play, there is a situation of "adding ideology." We know that whether in the old version of "Zhui Bai Qiu" or in the Peking Opera "Clever Chain," when Shi Qian is teasing the shopkeeper, he also steals many things from the shopkeeper, from hats, silver to the crowing golden rooster of Zhu Family Village; at the end, Shi Qian also takes away some odds and ends and sets fire to the Zhu Family Shop. The audience will not feel ill will towards Shi Qian because of this, because Shi Qian's habit is that of a "Drumming Rat" who is good at "chicken pecking and dog stealing"; moreover, he teases and steals the people and things of the Zhu Family Shop, which is the eyes and ears of the Zhu Family Village that opposes Liangshan, and the audience feels very satisfied. The revised version of the Han opera "Stealing the Chicken" also retains the plot of him teasing and stealing the people and things of the Zhu Family Shop, but at the end of the play, Shi Qian throws the stolen silver back to the shopkeeper. It seems that not doing so would damage the "heroic character" of Shi Qian; I think it is not necessary. Let the "Drumming Rat" Shi Qian take the stolen things to where he wants to take them!

### 看汉剧“盗鸡”有感

    看汉剧“盗鸡”有感
    大珂
    同一剧种的同一出戏曲剧目，由于不同演员创造性的劳动，在演出上，往往出现了好多“路子”。这些不同的艺术处理，符合了有各种爱好、趣味的观众的不同要求。特别是同一出剧目，在不同剧种的演出上，很多是从剧本到演出都各异其趣。应当说，在这一点上，同样也体现了我国戏曲艺术的丰富多姿。
    前不久，我在湖北省第一届戏曲观摩演出大会上，看到了一出汉剧传统剧目“盗鸡”，这是由湖北省直属代表团演出的。“盗鸡”是根据水浒传第四十六回“病关索大闹翠屏山，拼命三火烧祝家店”中时迁偷鸡的故事编写的。京剧有这出戏，叫“巧连环”，是著名演员叶盛章以及他的学生张春华的拿手好戏。在“巧连环”中，时迁尽情地戏耍了祝家庄祝家店里的恶店家，演员巧妙地运用了京剧的许多高超的武功，来表现这个“鼓上蚤”的独特性格。这是一出好戏。而湖北省直属代表团演出的“盗鸡”，便从剧本到演出都与“巧连环”有很多不同。“盗鸡”有时迁和杨雄、石秀在路上邂逅相遇的一场，时迁要求杨雄、石秀挈带引荐他同上梁山，但石秀却嫌他衣衫褴褛，时迁立时从庙里把佛像身上的冠带偷来穿上，这个细节是对石秀的一个善意的小讥讽，也引起了观众的哄笑（这个情节，在清代乾隆年间所刊行的戏曲汇集“缀白裘”里所选载的杂剧剧目“落店”、“偷鸡”中，也是有的）。而京剧“巧连环”则没有这一场戏。祝家店店家的性格，汉剧的和京剧的也不一样，在“盗鸡”中的店家，还有些小聪明，总想骗过斫轮老手时迁；“巧连环”中的店家，则更多地表现他的暴躁和势利眼的一面。在武功上，饰演“盗鸡”中的时迁的汉剧演员赵克非表现了相当高的造诣，其跌、扑、翻、腾，准确而利落，很好地塑造了时迁机警、风趣的性格；在基本功夫上，可以说和京剧没有什么两样，但在具体运用上，却与“巧连环”的舞蹈设计迥乎不同。在“唱”上，京剧的这出戏杨雄、石秀唱的是大字牌子，而汉剧的则是唱四平调。京剧的这出戏在结尾还有时迁等人与祝家庄“草鸡大王”格斗的一场；而汉剧则没有这一场。
    在有不顾本剧种剧目的演出特色、而生硬地搬用它剧种的处理方法的情况存在的今天，能看到不同处理的同一剧目的几种演出，这是特别能激发人的兴趣的。有一次，我到湖北省汉剧团去做客，曾经问过饰演“盗鸡”的演员赵克非同志，是否曾观摩过叶盛章或张春华同志的京剧“巧连环”；赵克非同志说并没有得到过观摩的机会。其实我以为，只要不生硬地套用和模仿，能够互相观摩学习，同样也是必要的。
    近来，在对戏曲传统剧目的整理工作中，常有一种“外加思想性”的做法。有些人不是根据原作中历史人物性格本身的发展逻辑来加以丰富和提高；却生硬地加上一些什么或删去一些什么，企图使原作中的人物形象更鲜明、使戏的主题思想更提高一些，但效果却适得其反。这也是一种简单化的做法。
    从整个剧本的整理工作上来看，汉剧“盗鸡”是整理得不错的，时迁的性格也刻划得相当准确和生动；但是，在戏的煞尾，却出现了“外加思想性”的情况。我们知道，无论在“缀白裘”的老本子里，还是在京剧“巧连环”里，时迁在戏耍店家的时候，还窃取了店家的许多东西，从帽子、银两以至于祝家庄的报晓金鸡；在结尾的时候，时迁还就手捎走了一些零什，并放火烧了祝家店。观众看了，并不会由此而对时迁产生恶感，因为时迁的习性本就是“鸡鸣狗盗”的一个“鼓上蚤”；而且，他戏耍和偷盗的乃是与梁山作对的祝家庄耳目机关祝家店的人和物，观众看了倒非常惬意。汉剧“盗鸡”的整理本中，也保留了他戏耍和偷盗祝家店的人与物的情节，可是在戏的结局，却让时迁把他偷得的银两又抛还给店家了。好像不这样便有损时迁这个人物的“英雄性格”似的；我看倒大可不必。让“鼓上蚤”时迁把偷来的东西带到他自己愿意带的地方去罢！
