    Willow Wicker Crafts
    Liu Qi
    Along the Yongding River in Gu'an County, Hebei Province, osier willows grow in rows. Willow wicker crafts are a famous specialty here.
    Osier willow is a deciduous shrub that grows by the water. After the new branches are peeled, they are soft, pliable, and white, making them the best raw material for willow wicker crafts. Gu'an County produces more than 150 kinds of willow wicker crafts, including boxes, winnowing fans, baskets, and children's toys. Most of the safety willow hats worn by workers at Anshan Iron and Steel, the Guanting Reservoir, and other mines and basic construction sites come from here. Gu'an County's willow trunks are characterized by their sturdiness, lightness, low price, moisture resistance, and beauty, and can be bought in markets in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, and Hohhot. Gu'an County's willow weaving production tools are also generally welcomed by farmers in ethnic minority areas such as Qinghai and Xinjiang. Last year, more than 40,000 winnowing fans were sold to Qinghai Province alone.
    Willow wicker producers in Gu'an County can also produce exquisite and beautiful willow wicker crafts. Shi Pinqing, a willow wicker producer in Wuweizhuang in his seventies, weaves excellent products such as "yuanbao baskets" and "copper basin baskets," which are rich in national characteristics and have been exhibited at international expositions. Every year during the "May Day" and National Day holidays, the flower baskets carried by the marching crowds in front of Tiananmen Square also come from Gu'an County.

    柳编工艺品
    刘琪
    在河北省固安县永定河的沿岸，杞柳成行。柳编工艺品是这里著名的特产。
    杞柳，是生在水边的落叶灌木，新条去皮后，柔纫洁白，是柳编工艺品最好的原料。固安县生产的柳编工艺品，有箱子、簸箕、篮和儿童玩具等一百五十多种。在鞍钢、官厅水库、以及其他一些矿山和基本建设工地上，工人们带的安全柳帽，大部来自这里。固安县柳条箱的特点是坚固、轻便、价廉、防潮、美观，在北京、天津、哈尔滨、呼和浩特等城市的市场上都可以买到。固安县的柳编生产工具，在青海、新疆等少数民族地区也普遍受到农民的欢迎，去年光销售到青海省的簸箕就有四万多张。
    固安县的柳编生产者还能生产精巧优美的柳编工艺品。无为庄七十多岁的柳编生产者石品青，编织的“元宝篮”、“铜盆篮”等优秀产品，富有民族特色，曾在国际博览会上展出过。每年“五一”节、国庆节，天安门前游行的队伍中所持的花篮，也是来自固安县的。
