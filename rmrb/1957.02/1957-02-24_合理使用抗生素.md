    Rational Use of Antibiotics
    Meng Qian
    Antibiotics are the most commonly used drugs in modern medicine and are considered an important weapon in preventing and treating diseases. Since the promotion of antibiotics in 1940, they have proven to be effective in the treatment and prevention of diseases caused by various bacteria, rickettsiae, and some filterable viruses. For example, penicillin is very effective in treating anti-streptococcal pneumonia; chloramphenicol is known as a specific drug for treating typhoid fever. Since liberation, China has widely used antibiotics in medical prevention work. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Health, the total amount of antibiotics used nationwide in 1955 increased by 580% compared to 1952, and there was even more increase in 1956. Before China used antibiotics, the mortality rate for patients with acute appendicitis complicated by peritonitis was 5%-10%, but after using antibiotics, it can be reduced to 0.5%; in the past, the mortality rate for patients with lobar pneumonia was about 30%, but after using antibiotics, the fever subsides on average in the second or third day, and the mortality rate drops to 2.3%. According to statistics from Peking Union Medical College Hospital, before the use of antibiotics, the mortality rate for epidemic typhus was 5.4%, and the complication rate was 34%; since 1953, with the use of antibiotics, there have been no more deaths or complications from epidemic typhus, and the mortality rate for tuberculous meningitis can also be reduced to 20%-36%. The effects of using antibiotics in other departments are also very good. It can be seen that antibiotics are very important drugs. However, achieving such good clinical results is inseparable from the rational use of antibiotics.
    Due to the effectiveness of antibiotics, some people regard them as a panacea that can be used for all diseases, resulting in many instances of antibiotic abuse. For example, doctors at the People's Hospital of Guyuan Hui Autonomous Region in Gansu province irresponsibly used more than 90 injections of penicillin in just over 20 days for a woman who had an abnormal delivery and whose perineal suture became infected. A registration clerk at the Harbin Pipeline Engineering Company's clinic had a severe cold, and the doctor prescribed one gram of chlortetracycline. The next day, the body temperature rose instead. The doctor then gave the patient five grams of chloramphenicol. On the third day, before the chloramphenicol was finished, the patient still had a fever. The doctor did not conduct a comprehensive examination but subjectively believed that there was a problem with the lungs, so he prescribed two bottles of penicillin and streptomycin, as well as glucose injections, oral vitamins, and sulfadiazine. A cold patient was given "four major antibiotics." Similarly, the phenomenon of commonly using antibiotics for general tuberculosis without a clear diagnosis is also very common. The manager of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company said, "In the past, a person rarely used more than 100 grams of streptomycin, but now it is not unusual for a person to use 300 or 400 grams."
    Can antibiotics cure all diseases?
    Taking the commonly used penicillin as an example, it has a certain effect on purulent diseases, gonorrhea, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, syphilis, yaws, rat-bite fever, and diplococcus pneumonia, but if a patient uses it frequently, drug resistance will develop, and it will lose its effectiveness. For example, using penicillin to treat diseases caused by Staphylococcus aureus, according to clinical use results in China, the incidence of drug resistance is as high as 60%. Recent statistics from the United Kingdom show that the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin reaches 80%. If the dosage of penicillin is too large, it can also produce severe vomiting, high fever, convulsions, and other adverse signs, causing suffering to the patient. More common side effects include local pain, chills, facial flushing, skin urticaria, and mucosal edema. Severe cases have resulted in anaphylactic shock and even death. According to incomplete statistics from the National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, there were 204 cases of allergic reactions in 1952 alone (118 cases in 1956), of which 35 deaths were caused by excessive use of penicillin.
    Streptomycin has a certain effect on whooping cough, bacillary pneumonia, purulent diseases, bacillary dysentery, tuberculosis, and plague, but most bacteria can develop drug resistance to it, so its clinical application is also greatly limited. For example, using it to treat tuberculosis bacillus infection, due to the long course of treatment, the incidence of drug resistance is very high, and it can also cause local pain, facial flushing, chills, high fever, decreased blood pressure, vomiting, rash (such as papular rash, urticaria, and erythema) and other adverse signs. If it is found that the patient has exfoliative dermatitis due to excessive medication and the medication is not stopped immediately, it may cause death. In addition, streptomycin often fails to treat urinary tract infections. It has a certain damaging effect on the eighth nerve, and excessive use can lead to hearing loss.
    According to research by medical scientists, chloramphenicol (China produces racemic chloramphenicol, also known as "hemei su") has a certain effect on purulent diseases, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, trachoma, epidemic typhus; chlortetracycline has a certain effect on diplococcus pneumonia and infection, purulent diseases, whooping cough, bacillary dysentery, relapsing fever, acute infectious jaundice, venereal lymphogranuloma, atypical pneumonia, trachoma, epidemic typhus, and amoebic dysentery; oxytetracycline has a certain effect on diplococcus pneumonia, whooping cough, purulent diseases, bacillary dysentery, trachoma, epidemic typhus, and amoebic dysentery. However, bacteria can also develop drug resistance to them. For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae even relies on chloramphenicol as a growth factor. Possible side effects during medication include nausea, vomiting, burning sensation, gastrointestinal inflation, diarrhea, dry mouth, sore throat, angular cheilitis, mucosal rash, vaginitis, and anal bleeding. The toxicity and side effects of oxytetracycline are similar to those of chlortetracycline.
    From the above simple explanation, antibiotics have a certain curative effect on some diseases, but improper use can lead to ineffectiveness and damage to health. Some sales units tell buyers that they are panaceas when selling them, which is inappropriate. The Ministry of Health issued a "Notice on the Management Principles of Antibiotic Drugs" to health administrative departments of various provinces and cities and directly affiliated medical units on December 17, 1956. Health departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, such as Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, Heilongjiang Province, and Anhui Province, have successively made corresponding regulations in light of local conditions, which has played a certain role in preventing the abuse of antibiotics. However, some provinces and cities and medical units have not paid attention to this issue.
    It is hoped that local health administrative departments will mobilize medical academic organizations to publicize the correct understanding of the uses of antibiotics to the people, and strengthen the education of medical personnel to correctly use antibiotics. Medical institutions at all levels should also conduct inspections on the use of antibiotics in their units, establish systems, and achieve rational use of antibiotics.

    合理使用抗生素
    孟谦
    抗生素类药品是近代医疗中最常用的药品，并且被人们认为是防治疾病的重要武器。从1940年推广使用抗生素以来，证明它对各种细菌、立克次体以及部分滤过性病毒所致疾病的治疗和预防有良好的作用。比如青霉素治抗球菌性肺炎效果很好；氯霉素被称为治疗伤寒的特效药。我国在解放后已将抗生素广泛用于医疗预防工作中。据卫生部初步统计，1955年全国抗生素使用总量比1952年增长了580％，1956年更有增加。在我国未使用抗生素以前，急性阑尾炎并发腹膜炎的病人，死亡率都在5％—10％，而使用抗生素后，就能够降低到0.5％；过去大叶肺炎病人的死亡率在30％左右，使用抗生素后平均第二三日即可退烧，死亡率降到2.3％。据中国协和医院统计，未使用抗生素前，斑疹伤寒的死亡率是5.4％，并发症是34％；自1953年使用抗生素以来，斑疹伤寒不再有死亡或并发症，结核性脑膜炎的死亡率亦可降到20％—36％，其他各科应用抗生素，效果也很好，可见抗生素是很重要的药物。但是获得如此良好临床效果，是和抗生素的合理使用分不开的。
    由于抗生素有如此的疗效，有些人便把它当作百病皆可用的万应丹，于是发生了许多滥用抗生素的现象。如甘肃固原回族自治区人民医院医生不负责任，使一异常分娩产妇会阴缝合部化脓，仅二十几天里，就使用青霉素九十余支；哈尔滨市管道工程公司卫生所挂号员患重症感冒，医生开给金霉素一克，第二天体温反而升高了，医生又给患者五克氯霉素，第三天氯霉素还未吃完，因患者仍发烧，这位医生没有全面进行检查，主观认为是肺部有问题，又开青霉素、链霉素两瓶，另外还给葡萄糖注射，口服维生素，磺胺嘧啶等；一个感冒病人，竟用了“四大抗生素”。至于类似诊断不明，一般结核病常用抗生素的现象也很普遍。北京市医药公司经理说：“过去一个人用链霉素，很少超过一百公分，现在一个人用三、四百公分不算一回事了”。
    抗生素是不是百病皆能治呢？
    拿常用的青霉素来说，它对化脓性疾病、淋病、流行性脑脊髓膜炎、梅毒、雅司、鼠咬热、双球菌肺炎有一定疗效，但是一个患者如果经常使用，就会发生抗药性，失去效力。比如用青霉素治疗金黄色葡萄球菌所致的疾病，根据我国在临床使用结果，抗药性的发生率高达60％，最近英国的统计，葡萄球菌对青霉素抗药性达80％。青霉素用量如果过大，还会产生剧烈的呕吐、高热、搐搦等不良征象，给病人带来苦痛。比较常见的副作用是引起局部疼痛、寒战、脸部发红、皮肤发生荨麻疹、粘膜水肿等症状，严重的发生过敏性休克，甚至造成死亡。据卫生部生物制品检定所不完全统计，在1952年一年中发生过敏性反应的有二百零四例（1956年占一百十八例），其中因使用青霉素过量而造成死亡的三十五例。
    链霉素对百日咳、杆菌肺炎、化脓性疾病、细菌性痢疾、结核病、鼠疫有一定疗效，但多数菌类能对它发生抗药性，因此它在临床应用上也受到很大限制。比如用它来治疗结核杆菌感染，由于疗程较长，抗药性发生率非常高，并且还会引起局部疼痛、脸红、寒战、高热、血压降低、呕吐、皮疹（如丘斑疹、荨麻疹和红斑）等不良征象。如果发现患者因用药过多发生剥脱性皮炎，不立即停止用药，便可能造成死亡。另外，链霉素用来治疗尿道感染病常常失败。它对第八神经有一定的损害，用多了会使人丧失听觉。
    根据医药学家的研究，氯霉素（本国产有混旋氯霉素，亦称“合霉素”）对化脓性疾病、伤寒、副伤寒、砂眼、斑疹伤寒；金霉素对双球菌肺炎及感染、化脓性疾病、百日咳、细菌性痢疾、回归热、急性传染性的黄疸、性病性淋巴肉芽肿、异型肺炎、砂眼、斑疹伤寒、阿米巴痢疾；地霉素对双球菌肺炎、百日咳、化脓性疾病、细菌性痢疾、砂眼、斑疹伤寒、阿米巴痢疾有一定疗效。但菌类对它们也能发生抗药性。像肺炎杆菌还依赖氯霉素为生长因素，用药时可能发生的副作用是恶心、呕吐、冒灼热、肠胃充气、腹泻、口干、喉痛、口角炎、粘膜发疹、阴道炎和肛门出血等征象，地霉素的毒性和副作用同金霉素相似。
    从上面简单的说明来看，抗生素对某些病症具有一定的疗效，但用得不恰当会造成无效，损害健康。有的销售单位在出售时告诉购者说是万宝灵药，这是不恰当的。卫生部在1956年12月17日曾向各省市卫生行政部门及直属医疗单位发出“关于抗生素类药品的管理原则的通知”，各省市卫生厅、局，如广东省、广州市、黑龙江省、安徽省均已先后结合当地情况作了相当的规定，这对防止滥用抗生素起了一定的作用。但也有一些省市和医疗单位还没有重视这个问题。
    希望各地卫生行政主管部门发动医药学术团体，向人民宣传正确认识抗生素的用途，并加强对医务人员的教育，正确使用抗生素，各级医疗机构也要对本单位使用抗生素情况进行检查，定出制度，做到合理使用抗生素。
