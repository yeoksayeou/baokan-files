    Dog-Sitting Industry
    A new industry is emerging in the United Kingdom and the United States, called the dog-sitting industry. This industry specializes in serving the beloved dogs of gentlemen and ladies. It is said that the pay in this industry is quite high. In the UK, the remuneration is five shillings per hour, and meals are often provided. Therefore, this business has become very popular recently, and many people who originally took care of children have switched to dog-sitting. In the United States, there are even specialized employment agencies to introduce dog-sitters.
    Specially Designed Restaurant
    In the "Baltic Exchange" in the business district of London, there is a specially designed restaurant. Its underground section can absorb radiation, and there is also a very thick reinforced concrete box-shaped room. This "box top" can withstand the entire pressure when the entire building collapses. What is the purpose of building such a restaurant? It was originally prepared to be used as an air-raid shelter in the event of an atomic war.
    Dumping "Mobile Coffins"
    Recently, West Germany has been very dissatisfied with the large number of military supplies sold to it by the United States. West German newspapers have called the thousands of M-47 tanks purchased from the United States old "exhibits on war monuments." An armored commander even called them "mobile coffins." But in any case, the US bosses have indeed cleared out a lot of their military inventory.

    伴狗业
    现在在英美有一种新兴的行业，叫做伴狗业。这种行业就是专门服侍那些先生、太太们的爱狗的。据说这门行业待遇还很高。在英国报酬是每小时五先令，还常供膳。因此近来这项生意非常吃香，许多原来从事替人照管儿童的人也转而伴狗了。在美国并且还设立了专门介绍伴狗的职业机构。
    特别设计的餐厅
    在伦敦商业区“波罗的海交易所”里，有一所特别设计的餐厅。它的地下部分能够吸收放射线，还有一个很厚的钢筋混凝土的箱形房间。这个“箱顶”能够承受整个建筑物倒塌时的全部压力。建造这样的餐厅做什么呢？原来是准备在发生原子战争时用作防空洞的。
    倾销“活动棺材”
    最近西德对于美国卖给它的大批军事物资感到非常不满。西德报纸把从美国买来的几千辆M—47式坦克称为陈旧的“战迹纪念塔上的陈列品”。一位装甲司令并把它叫做“活动棺材”。但是不管怎样，美国老板仓库里的军火存货的确出清了不少。
