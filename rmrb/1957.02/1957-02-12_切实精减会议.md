    Earnestly Streamline Meetings
    The Inner Mongolia Dalate Banner Committee of the Chinese Communist Party originally planned to spend 145 days in the first quarter of this year holding 29 meetings. The number of participants would be 2,770 person-times. The estimated cost of the meetings would be more than 10,570 yuan.
    Now their plan has changed. They are determined to greatly reduce the number of meetings. Any meetings that can be resolved by leading comrades going down to handle matters without holding a meeting will be resolutely cancelled; meetings that can be merged will be merged as much as possible; in this way, 20 meetings have been reduced. How beneficial is it to reduce 20 meetings? They did the math: they can save more than 9,000 yuan in meeting expenses, and free up more than 13,600 workdays occupied by meetings; the number of participants can be reduced to 531 person-times. From this, it can be seen that reducing unnecessary meetings is not only an important aspect of improving leadership methods, but also an important aspect of saving manpower and material resources.
    Everywhere now we can hear complaints that there are too many meetings, and leading cadres are no exception, but what is the use of just complaining? We should, like Dalate Banner, earnestly do some work to streamline meetings. (Shihong)

    切实精减会议
    中共内蒙古达拉特后旗委员会今年第一季度原打算占用一百四十五天时间召开二十九个会议。参加会议的将有二千七百七十多人次。会议的经费预计要一万零五百七十多元。
    现在他们的计划变了。他们决心大大压缩会议次数。凡是可由领导同志下去解决不必采取开会形式的会议坚决不开；可合并的会议尽量合并；这样就减少了二十个会议。少开二十个会议有多大好处呢？他们算了一笔帐：可节省会议开支九千多元，腾出被会议占用的劳动日一万三千六百多个；参加会议的人可减少到五百三十一人次。由此可见，减少不必要的会议不但是改进领导方式的一个重要方面，也是节约人力物力的一个重要方面。
    现在到处都可以听到抱怨会议太多的呼声，领导干部也不例外，可是仅仅抱怨有什么用呢？应该像达拉特后旗这样，切实作一点精减会议的工作才对。（士宏）
