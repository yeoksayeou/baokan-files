Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 1st. Minister of Coal Industry Chen Yu went to the Xishan Coal Mine on the 31st to celebrate the Spring Festival with the workers.

After breakfast, the miners of the Baijiazhuang Mine put on new clothes and took their families to the Workers' Club, the cinema, and the Spring Festival opera performance stage. The streets were filled with joy. Minister Chen Yu came to the front of the stage and shouted loudly to the miners, "Happy New Year, comrades!" and shook hands with the people standing in front. At this time, applause rose from the crowd, and they shouted "Guarantee to complete the holiday production increase task!" Chen Yu also visited the miners' collective dormitories, family residences, and New Year goods supply points. He also made a special trip to the canteen of the Du'erping Mine to thank the cooks for preparing holiday food for the workers.

The 31st was the only holiday for the workers of the Xishan Mining Bureau during the Spring Festival. At eight o'clock on the morning of February 1st, they will begin their intensive holiday production increase activities. Since the State Council issued the call for increasing raw coal production during the holiday, hundreds of people in the mine have given up the idea of going home, and many groups have collectively written guarantees to insist on holiday production. Although the 31st was a holiday, more than 1,000 workers participated in mechanical maintenance, striving to complete the maintenance tasks of the past three days in one day to create conditions for increasing coal production.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 31st. Tianjin Mayor Huang Huoqing and Deputy Mayor Li Gengtao spent the Lunar New Year's Eve last night happily with workers, shop assistants, and others in Tianjin.

Huang Huoqing arrived at the Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory in the evening to participate in the ongoing worker-peasant-soldier grand celebration. He first played carrom with the children, then came to the "Little Restaurant" which temporarily supplied workers with late-night snacks and talked to the busy cooks. He also inquired about the workers' preparations for the New Year in the hall. Afterwards, Huang Huoqing rushed to the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory to celebrate the festival with the workers. That afternoon, he also accepted the invitation of a group of Communist Youth League members from the second year of high school at No. 15 Middle School to participate in their Spring Festival symposium. He told the students about his participation in the student movement when he was young and encouraged them to carry forward the glorious traditions of the revolution.

Li Gengtao participated in four Spring Festival parties held by democratic parties, shop assistants, the sports community, and cadres of the Municipal People's Committee that night. He also participated in a basketball game with more than 4,000 spectators that night, and his brave ball-grabbing actions constantly aroused applause and cheers from the audience.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 31st. Today, many party and government leaders in Nanjing went to factories, schools, suburban agricultural cooperatives, and streets to wish workers, peasants, students, military families, and revolutionary martyrs a happy Spring Festival.

Jiang Jingyu, Deputy Mayor of Nanjing, and Wang Mian, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, participated in the Spring Festival celebration of the Honghua Vegetable Production Cooperative in the Yuhuatai District of the suburbs of Nanjing this afternoon. After Jiang Jingyu listened to Zhang Dengke, the director of the cooperative, introduce the cooperative's production achievements and this year's production plan at the celebration, he repeatedly congratulated the members, encouraged everyone to work harder in the new year and achieve greater success; and asked everyone to pay attention to developing sideline occupations and raising more pigs to accumulate fertilizer.

Jiang Jingyu and Wang Mian also watched the entertainment programs such as "Duì Huā" (answering flower songs), "Huā Chuán" (flower boat dance), and "Zhāi Shíliú" (picking pomegranates) performed by the members of the agricultural cooperative, and talked with the military families and production team leaders in the cooperative.

After the gathering, he went to the door of the house of Shi Jingren, an old bridge worker. Shi Jingren shook Song Kanfu's hand and said, "We should pay New Year's greetings to the leader first. Look, the leader has come to pay New Year's greetings to us first. How can this be?..." Song Kanfu asked, "Is it difficult to buy pork this Spring Festival?" "No, the pork supply for the Spring Festival is very sufficient, and our workers all have meat to eat." Then, Song Kanfu went to the home of Lin Zhiyun, the foreman of the advanced work team. Lin Zhiyun said to him, "We are so happy to be riggers now. My wife asked me: 'Why doesn't your shoulder get worn out now?' I explained to her: 'Because it's mechanized now, and we don't have to lift heavy things anymore.'" Song Kanfu said, "Your work is still very hard." Lin Zhiyun replied, "If everyone doesn't work hard, how can we build socialism!" (Changjiang Daily Editorial Department)
