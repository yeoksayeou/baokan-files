Title: Let's Also Talk About Quju (Chinese Opera)

After reading Comrade Tang Shi's "Let Quyi Dramas Blossom in Their Own Way" (see People's Daily, January 17, page 8), I have differing opinions on some of the suggestions he made regarding Quju.

The emergence of Quju as a dramatic genre is a recent development. This genre has its own superior conditions. First, both male and female vocal techniques have a strong foundation; second, the melodies are rich; third, the original storytelling form is close to the lives of modern people and easily accepted by the general public; fourth, the genre is new, with no restrictions on creation. This provides unlimited possibilities for the further development of Quju.

Taking the "Beijing Quyi Troupe" as an example, they have successively performed "Willow Well," "Luo Han Money," and other plays, gradually gaining people's attention. Especially at the end of 1954, during the "Beijing First Opera Observation and Performance Conference," after performing "Zhang Gui Rong" and "Luo Han Money," it was generally believed that the Quju genre could continue to exist and develop; moreover, the Quju form was in no way inferior to any other genre in reflecting modern life.

However, in the past one or two years, attendance has been getting lower and lower. In particular, modern dramas are becoming less and less popular with audiences; what they love to watch are ancient costume dramas such as "Drinking Noodle Soup" and "Choosing a Son-in-Law." Therefore, they brought "Borrowing the New Year," "Hunting Birds," and "Meeting on the Road" to the stage.

Quju actors have no foundation in opera performance art. Especially in ancient costumes, they don't know how to walk, and they don't know how to dance with water sleeves. This requires a long period of study. However, in order to meet the audience's demands, they have to learn and practice on the spot, reluctantly performing ancient costume plays.

This is the situation that Quju – especially the "Beijing Quyi Troupe" – is currently encountering.

To this day, no one has written a script specifically for Quju. Writing Quju requires both understanding Quyi and understanding drama. It seems that there is no such talent today. Therefore, Comrade Tang Shi accuses the Quyi Troupe of "specializing in performing good plays from other genres," believing it to be "greedy for ready-made things" – this is not in accordance with the facts and is also unfair. Comrade Tang Shi also advocates adapting excellent programs from Quyi, such as "Daiyu's Sad Autumn," into Quju, as if this is the direction in which Quju should develop. I believe that regardless of whether the storytelling form of "Daiyu's Sad Autumn" can be adapted into a good script, even if it is, please think, with today's Quju actors, let them perform Lin Daiyu, Jia Baoyu, etc. on stage, the performance effect is not difficult to imagine, right?

Comrade Tang Shi is deeply dissatisfied with the fact that Quju does not have its own performance methods. It is true that a genre should have its own unique performance methods. However, it may be too demanding to ask a new genre with only a few years of history to have its own performance methods! The formation of any genre is from rough to gradually delicate, from imitation to gradually creative, from absorbing the essence of other genres as nourishment, and gradually enriching itself. Quju is certainly no exception.

Comrade Tang Shi only affirmed the "Beijing Quyi Troupe's" "Women's Representatives," saying it was "quite successful." But then he pointed out a series of shortcomings: "The performance path is basically that of spoken drama. The actors rarely use opera performance techniques on stage, and even less do they display the bold performance methods of Quyi artists, such as waving their arms and dancing their sleeves; the body movements are simply non-existent, and there are many naturalistic performances, such as bringing out a footbath to wash their feet on stage." Quju's "Zhang Gui Rong" is adapted from the spoken drama "Women's Representatives." In performance, it adopts a realistic performance method; needless to say, Quju actors do not know "opera performance techniques," nor have they learned any "body movements," even if they do, then the use of those "opera performance techniques" or "body movements" in performing modern dramas must also be carefully considered. We can't have the heroine Zhang Gui Rong do a "lying fish" and the hero Wang Jiang do a "start of hegemony," right? As for "the bold performance methods of Quyi artists, such as waving their arms and dancing their sleeves," for example, "dancing sleeves" – Zhang Gui Rong wears modern clothes, and the sleeves are neither long nor wide, how can she dance? Regarding "naturalistic performances," it is said that there are "quite a few." Unfortunately, Comrade Tang Shi only gave one example: "Bringing out a footbath to wash feet." As one of the directors of the play, I dare to solemnly declare that the "Beijing Quyi Troupe's" performance of "Zhang Gui Rong" does not have the plot of "bringing out a footbath to wash feet" at all!

How Quju should develop needs to be discussed. However, I dare to boldly answer the final question raised by Comrade Tang Shi: "Performing good plays from other genres" is not wrong for any genre. Specifically speaking of Quju, even if it is "specialized in performing" today, it is not impossible. "Is this the path that Quju should take?" The answer is: yes, especially today – but it is not the only path. Because, everyone knows that if we wait until we "adapt so many of our own good dramatic traditional Quyi programs into Quju," and then "create" a set of Quju's own performance methods, and then perform them, then our beloved Quju, not to mention development, I am afraid it will soon come to an end! In the history of drama, we have not found any genre that waits for "all preparations to be ready," as long as it "chooses an auspicious day to open," it will become a genre that has both its own unique repertoire and its own unique performance methods.

### 也来谈谈曲剧

    也来谈谈曲剧
    张艾丁
    读完了唐湜同志的“曲艺剧多开些自己的花”（见人民日报1月17日第八版）后，对于他所提出的有关曲剧的一些意见，我是有着不同看法的。
    曲剧这一剧种的出现，是近几年来的事。这个剧种是有自己的优越条件的。第一，男女声歌唱技术，都是很有基础的；第二，曲调丰富；第三，原先的说唱形式，接近现代人民的生活，容易为广大群众所接受；第四，剧种是新生的，在创造上没有什么限制。这就给曲剧进一步的发展，提供了无限的可能性。
    以“北京市曲艺团”为例，他们先后演出了“柳树井”、“罗汉钱”等剧，逐渐获得人们的重视。特别是1954年底，在“北京市第一届戏曲观摩演出大会”中，演出了“张桂容”和“罗汉钱”后，大家一般认为：曲剧这一剧种，是能够继续存在发展下去的；并且，曲剧这一形式，在反映现代生活上，较之其他任何剧种，都毫无逊色。
    但是，近一、二年来，上座率越来越低。特别是现代剧，观众越来越不爱看；爱看的却是“喝面叶”、“挑女婿”、等古装戏。因此，他们才将“借年”、“打鸟”、“路遇”等，都搬上了舞台。
    曲剧演员，对于戏曲表演艺术，是没有基础的。特别是古装，穿了起来，不大会走，有了水袖，也不大会舞。这是需要长时期学习的。然而，为了满足观众要求，他（她）们不得不现学现练，勉为其难地表演起古装戏来。
    这就是曲剧——特别是“北京市曲艺团”目下所遭遇的情况。
    直到今天，还没有人专为曲剧来写剧本。写曲剧是既需要懂曲艺，又需要懂戏的。在今天，好像还没有这样的人材。因此，唐湜同志责备曲艺团“专门搬演别的剧种的好戏”，认为是“贪图现成”——这是不合乎事实，也是不公平的。唐湜同志还主张将曲艺中的优秀节目，如“黛玉悲秋”等，改编成曲剧，好像这才是曲剧应该发展的方向。我认为：姑无论能否将说唱形式的“黛玉悲秋”改编成好的剧本，即使改成了，请想，以今日的曲剧演员，让他们在舞台上表演林黛玉、贾宝玉等，其演出效果，也是不难想像的吧？
    唐湜同志对于曲剧没有自己的表演方法，深为不满。不错，一个剧种，是应该有自己的独特的表演方法的。但是，对于一个只有短短几年历史的新生的剧种，就要求它有自己的表演方法，恐怕也是一种苛求吧！任何一个剧种的形成，都是由粗糙而逐渐细致，由模仿而逐渐创造，由吸取其他剧种的菁华作为养料，而逐渐丰富起自己来的。曲剧当然不是例外。
    唐湜同志只肯定了“北京市曲艺团”的“妇女代表”，说是“相当成功的”。但跟着就指出了一系列的缺点：“演出的路子基本上也是话剧的。演员在舞台上很少运用戏曲的表演手法，更没有发挥曲艺艺人的那种挥臂舞袖的大胆的表演方法；身段简直等于没有，自然主义的表演倒不少，如在舞台上端出脚盆洗足等。”曲剧的“张桂容”，是根据话剧“妇女代表”改编的。在表演上，采用了接近写实的表演方法；不必说曲剧演员不会“戏曲的表演手法”，也没有学会什么“身段”，就是会，那么表演现代剧，究应采用那些“戏曲的表演手法”或是“身段”，也是必须慎重考虑的。我们总不能让女主人公张桂容来个“卧鱼”，男主人公王江来个“起霸”吧？至于“曲艺艺人的那种挥臂舞袖的大胆的表演方法”，比如“舞袖”——张桂容穿的是现代服装，袖子既不长也并不宽，如何舞法呢？关于“自然主义的表演”，据说“倒不少”。可惜唐湜同志只举出了一点：“端出脚盆洗足”。作为该剧导演之一，我敢郑重声明：“北京市曲艺团”演出的“张桂容”，根本就没有“端出脚盆洗足”这一情节！
    曲剧究应如何发展，是需要讨论的。但是，我还敢大胆答复唐湜同志最后提出的问题：“搬演别的剧种的好戏”，对于任何剧种来说，都并无错误。具体说到曲剧，在今天，即使“专门搬演”，也并无不可。这“是曲剧应该走的道路吗？”答曰：是的，特别是在今天——但并不是唯一的路。因为，谁都知道：如果要等“把自己的那么多好的有戏剧性的传统曲艺节目编成曲剧”，再“创造”好一套曲剧自己的表演方法，然后再来演出的话，那么，我们可爱的曲剧，不必说发展了，恐怕马上就得寿终正寝！在戏剧史上，我们还没有发现过任何一个剧种，它是等待“一切筹备就绪”，只要“择吉开张”，就会成为既有自己独特的剧目，又有自己独特的表演方法的。
