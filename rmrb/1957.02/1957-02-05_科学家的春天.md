    The Spring of Scientists	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing Reporter
    The traditional festival—the Spring Festival—adds a strong sense of spring to the homes of scientists.

    In the bright morning, guests congratulating the Spring Festival passed through the quiet Tsinghua Garden and arrived at the home of Qian Weichang, a specialist in mechanics. On the nanmu table were several exquisite fruit boxes, surrounded by many chairs and stools, which clearly showed that Qian Weichang was a hospitable person.

    The first to arrive was Ye Kaiyuan, who seemed to be at home, busily pouring tea for the later guests and serving lotus seed soup. Hu Haichang also arrived. He and Ye Kaiyuan were both students of Qian Weichang, and the teachers and students together won science prizes. Qian Weichang always regarded his students as good friends for discussion. His students often dared to express their opinions in front of him and were happy to tell their teacher about their academic progress. The energy and time Qian Weichang has spent cultivating young scientists in recent years have now yielded concrete results.

    The guests came not only to congratulate the scientists on the Spring Festival but also to celebrate their scientific achievements. Mathematician Hua Luogeng agreed to the guests' request and read aloud the congratulatory letter from Markusevich, Vice President of the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of the Soviet Union and an expert in function theory. Hua Luogeng was not complacent about his achievements at all. To encourage himself and young people, he quoted Chairman Mao's words and wrote a couplet: "Modesty helps one to progress, study, study, and study again"; "Pride makes one lag behind, be vigilant, be vigilant, and be vigilant again."

    Qian Xuesen has recently received congratulatory letters from some strangers. They wrote after learning from the newspaper that he had won the first-class science prize. Qian Xuesen said humbly to the guests that scientific research is very ordinary work, but even a little achievement is of concern to the masses. Qian Xuesen returned to the motherland with great ideals and devoted himself to arduous research. As written in a poem personally inscribed by Guo Moruo to Qian Xuesen. The poem hanging in the living room reads:
    "A great fire flows aimlessly outside the clouds, how many times have I seen the moon on the tower,
    The Pacific Ocean is fraught with treacherous winds and waves, the West Lake scenery is secluded,
    Breaking through the barriers to return to the motherland, participating in planning and contributing great strategies,
    From now on, in the next twelve years, let us look forward to traveling among the stars."

    From Qian Xuesen's conversation, we know that he is also very good at music.

    "Mr. Qian is so interested in music, is it influenced by Mrs. Qian?" the reporter asked.

    This sentence brought Qian Xuesen back to his youth. More than twenty years ago, when he was studying at Jiaotong University, he was already a famous brass player among the students. This famous mechanic also has a deep fondness for traditional Chinese calligraphy and painting. He said that he likes calligraphy the most, it seems to be the most refined and beautiful picture. Qian Xuesen is from Hangzhou. Whenever he returns to his hometown, he always goes to Xiling Seal Engravers' Society in West Lake to see a couplet of seal characters written by Wu Changshuo, a famous calligrapher and painter of the late Qing Dynasty. Now, on his bookshelf, there are also books such as Fine Arts Series. According to Qian Xuesen himself, he also studied traditional Chinese painting when he was around twenty years old!

    People praised his rich and colorful cultural and recreational life. Qian Xuesen said: Our Mr. Hua Luogeng is also very knowledgeable about Peking Opera. When we visited Hua Luogeng, we also heard from his friends that he is a theater fan, mainly Peking Opera, Kunqu Opera, and Yue Opera. These hobbies are precisely the extremely rich spiritual world of these scientists.

    When the reporter asked the famous female scientist He Zehui how she spent the Spring Festival, she hugged the children around her and said: I am not free on weekdays, now is a good opportunity for me to "repay my debt"—telling them stories and checking their homework.

    Time is precious to scientists. The Spring Festival is a time for people to relax and rest, but they are busy with new work again. Mr. Qian Xuesen and Mr. Qian Weichang are taking advantage of the Spring Festival to prepare for the mechanics conference to be held on the 5th. Hua Luogeng also plans to go to Harbin to give lectures after the Spring Festival. Botanist Zhong Buqiu, as always, is concentrating on writing academic papers to be discussed at home.

    科学家的春天	新华社驻北京记者
    传统的节日——春节，为科学家们的家庭增添了浓厚的春意。
    在明朗的清晨，祝贺春节的客人穿过幽静的清华园，来到力学家钱伟长的家里。楠木桌上摆着几只精致的果盒，围着桌子陈设着许多椅凳，一看就知道钱伟长是个好客的人。
    来得最早的是叶开沅，他好像在自己家里一样，忙碌地为后来的客人沏茶，一会儿又端来莲子羹。胡海昌也来了，他和叶开沅都是钱伟长的学生，师生们一起获得了科学奖金。钱伟长从来把他的学生当作切磋的良友。他的学生们在他面前也常常敢于发表自己的意见，乐于把自己在学术上的进益告诉给自己的老师。钱伟长这几年来培养科学后辈所付出的精力和时间，现在已经有了具体的成就。
    客人们不仅是来给科学家祝贺春节，同时也是来为他们庆贺在科学上的丰收。数学家华罗庚答应客人们的请求，把苏联教育科学院副院长、函数论专家马尔库舍维奇的贺信读给客人们听。华罗庚丝毫没有对自己的成就自满，他为了勉励自己和年轻人，曾引用毛主席的话写成了一副对联：“虚心使人进步，学习学习再学习”；“骄傲使人落后，警惕警惕再警惕”。
    钱学森最近也接到了一些陌生人的祝贺信。他们是从报纸上得知他获得一等科学奖金以后写来的。钱学森很谦逊地对客人们说，科学研究是很平凡的工作，但有一点成就，都为群众所关怀。钱学森抱着伟大的理想回到了祖国，专心致志地从事艰苦的研究工作。正如郭沫若亲笔题赠给钱学森的一首诗里写的一样。这首挂在客厅里的诗这样写着：
    “大火无心云外流，登楼几见月当头，
    太平洋上风涛险，西子湖中景色幽，
    突破藩篱归故国，参加规划献宏猷，
    从兹十二年间事，跨箭相期星际游”。
    从钱学森的谈话里，我们知道他对音乐也很在行。
    “钱先生对音乐那么感兴趣，是不是受钱夫人的影响呢？”记者问。
    这句话把钱学森带回青年时代的回忆中。二十多年前他在交通大学求学，那时他就是学生中有名的铜管乐吹手了。这个著名的力学家对我国传统的书画也有很深的癖好。他说他最喜欢书法，它好像最精炼的优美图画。钱学森是杭州人，他每逢回到家乡，总要到西湖的西冷印社去看看清末的名书画家吴昌硕写的一副篆字对联。现在，在他的书架上还摆着美术丛刊等书籍，据钱学森自己说，他二十岁左右的时候，还学过国画呢！
    人们很赞誉他这丰富多采的文娱生活。钱学森说：我们的华罗庚先生对京戏也很内行。我们在访问华罗庚时，又听到他的朋友说他是一个戏剧迷，其中主要是京戏、昆曲和越剧。这些爱好，正是这些科学家们极其丰富的精神世界。
    当记者问到著名女科学家何泽慧先生如何过春节时，她搂着身边的孩子说：平日不得闲，现在正是我“还债”的好机会——为她们讲故事，检查她们的功课。
    时间对科学家很宝贵。春节是人们安闲休息的日子，但是他们却又在为新的工作忙碌着。钱学森和钱伟长两位先生正趁着春节为将在5日召开的力学会议作准备工作。华罗庚也打算在春节后到哈尔滨去讲学。植物学家锺补求也和往日一样，正在家里聚精会神地在赶写即将讨论的学术论文。
