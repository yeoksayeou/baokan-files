Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The Israeli embassy in the United States issued a statement to the press on the evening of the 17th saying that Israel "largely agrees" with the "aims and principles" in the U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' proposal to Israel regarding Israeli withdrawal. The statement said: "Israel's reply to Dulles' proposal should not be regarded as a rejection."

    At the same time as issuing this statement, the Israeli embassy also released a memorandum which the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Eban, gave to Dulles on the 15th. The memorandum expressed thanks for the U.S. proposal, and also mentioned: "Israeli troops should remain in the Aqaba area until Egypt and Israel conclude a peace treaty, or at least reach a permanent agreement guaranteeing freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba." Regarding the Gaza Strip, the memorandum expressed a desire to manage the affairs of this region together with local Arab authorities and the United Nations. This memorandum also stated: "The Gaza region has never been a part of Egypt."

Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: News from the Israeli-controlled area of Jerusalem: The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the evening of the 18th, insisting that Israel is "fully entitled" to prevent the situation from returning to the status quo before it launched its aggression against Egypt.

    The statement said that the U.S. memorandum to the Israeli government regarding the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Egypt did acknowledge that the Gulf of Aqaba is an international waterway enjoying full freedom of navigation. However, the statement said, the U.S. did not answer the question of how to maintain freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba after Israeli troops withdraw from the coastal areas of the Gulf of Aqaba. The statement also said that the U.S. memorandum did not offer guarantees to prevent so-called Egyptian "attacks."

    The Israeli government also announced on the 18th that it would immediately recall its ambassador to the United States, Eban, for consultations on the withdrawal issue.

    News from Washington says that U.S. officials expect Israeli ambassador Eban to persuade his government to believe that Israel should show restraint in the deadlock over the withdrawal issue. U.S. officials also believe that Eban himself is convinced that Israel would ultimately benefit from pursuing a more flexible policy.

Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: Washington News: According to White House Press Secretary Hagerty's announcement on the 18th, Eisenhower, who is currently vacationing in southern Georgia, has decided to return to Washington early on the 19th to deal with the Middle East issue. This decision was made after Eisenhower consulted with Dulles, and they discussed the "further actions" the U.S. might take in the United Nations due to Israel's preconditions for withdrawing from Egypt.

    News says that Eisenhower will convene leaders from both parties in Congress at the White House on the 20th to discuss the Middle East situation. Those attending the meeting will include Vice President Nixon, Secretary of State Dulles, and leaders from both parties in the Senate and House of Representatives, including senior personnel from the Foreign Affairs, Appropriations, and Military Committees.

    以色列在美国袒护下继续耍赖
    要求取得盘踞加沙和亚喀巴湾的保证
    艾森豪威尔将召集国会领袖讨论中东局势
    据新华社19日讯　以色列驻美大使馆17日晚向报界发表声明说，以色列“在很大程度上同意”美国国务卿杜勒斯向以色列提出的关于以色列撤军建议中的“目的和原则”。声明说：“不能认为以色列对杜勒斯建议的答复是一种拒绝。”
    以色列大使馆在发表这个声明的同时，还公布了15日以色列驻美大使伊班交给杜勒斯的一份备忘录。备忘录对美国的建议表示感谢，同时它还提到：“以色列部队应当留在亚喀巴地区，直到埃及和以色列缔结和平条约为止，或者至少达成了一个保证亚喀巴湾的航行自由的永久性协定为止”。关于加沙地带，备忘录表示要和当地的阿拉伯当局和联合国一起管理这个地区的事务。这个备忘录还说：“加沙地区从来都不是埃及的一部分。”
    新华社19日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列外交部18日晚发表声明，坚持以色列“完全有权”不让局势恢复到它对埃及发动侵略以前的原状。
    声明说，美国给以色列政府的关于以色列从埃及撤军问题的备忘录，的确承认了亚喀巴湾是一条享有完全航行自由的国际水道。但是，声明说，美国没有答复在以色列军队撤出亚喀巴湾沿岸地区以后如何维持亚喀巴湾航行自由这个问题。声明还说，美国的备忘录也没有提出防止所谓埃及进行“攻击”的保证。
    以色列政府还在18日宣布立即召回它的驻美国大使伊班，以便就撤军问题进行磋商。
    来自华盛顿的消息说，美国官员预料以色列大使伊班将说服他的政府，使它相信在撤军问题的僵局中以色列应该有所节制。美国的官方人士并且认为，伊班自己深信，以色列如果奉行比较有伸缩性的政策的话，到头来是会获得好处的。
    据新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：据白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂18日宣布，目前正在佐治亚州南部度假的艾森豪威尔已经决定提前在19日返回华盛顿处理中东问题。这个决定是在艾森豪威尔同杜勒斯商谈后作出的，他们曾经讨论了由于以色列对从埃及撤军提出了先决条件，美国可能在联合国中采取的“进一步行动”。
    有消息说，艾森豪威尔20日将召集国会两党领袖在白宫举行会议，讨论中东局势。参加会议的将有副总统尼克松，国务卿杜勒斯以及参众两院的两党领袖，其中包括外交、拨款和军事各委员会的多数派和少数派的高级人员。
