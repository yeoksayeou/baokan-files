Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 14th: A group of former People's Liberation Army officers who have transferred to local work have written to their former unit leaders, reporting that they have been warmly welcomed by Party and government organizations since arriving in their localities, and that their work has been properly arranged.

The unit stationed in the Xiamen area recently received more than 40 letters from transferred military officers from the Jining area of Shandong Province. In these letters, the transferred officers expressed their satisfaction with the assigned work. Although they encountered some difficulties in their work, local comrades took the initiative to help solve them. Zheng Mingkun, the former section chief of the logistics department of a certain unit, who was assigned to work in the Jinjiang area of Fujian Province, stated in his letter, in addition to describing the care shown to him by local cadres, that he would inherit the glorious tradition of the People's Army, carry forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity, humbly learn, and diligently work for the Party. Jiang Huaiyi, the former head of the cadre section of a certain unit, who was assigned to work in the Longxi area of Fujian Province, also told his old comrades in the army that he would never bow to difficulties under any circumstances, nor would he care about personal gains or losses, and that he would make achievements in local work. Many transferred officers also stated in their letters that they would be ready to answer the call of the motherland at any time and return to the front lines to defend the country.

These transferred military officers all went to work in the localities last winter. The cadre departments of the CPC Jining Prefectural Committee of Shandong Province, and the CPC Longxi and Jinjiang Prefectural Committees of Fujian Province have also written to say that the transferred cadres go to work happily wherever they are assigned, and that their work, study, and unity are all very good. They expressed their gratitude to the People's Liberation Army for cultivating such an outstanding group of cadres.

    一批转业军官
    安心新的工作
    新华社福州14日电　转业到地方工作的前解放军军官，纷纷写信给原部队首长，报告他们到地方以后受到党政机关热情欢迎，工作得到妥善安置的情形。
    驻厦门地区的某部队，最近收到转业军官从山东省济宁专区寄来的四十多封信。在这些信上，转业军官对分配的工作表示很满意，虽然工作中遇到一些困难，但地方同志都主动帮助解决。分配到福建省晋江专区工作的前某部后勤部科长郑明坤的信上，除了说明地方干部对他的关怀以外，还表示一定继承人民军队的光荣传统，发扬艰苦朴素的精神，虚心学习，勤勤恳恳地为党工作。到福建龙溪专区工作的前某部干部处处长蒋怀义还向部队的老战友们表示在任何情况下决不会向困难低头，也不会计较个人得失，一定要在地方工作中作出成绩。许多转业军官的来信中还表示：他们将随时听候祖国的召唤，重返前线保卫祖国。
    这些转业军官都是去年冬季到地方工作的。中共山东济宁地委、中共福建龙溪、晋江地委等干部部门也来信说，转业干部分配到那里就愉快地到那里去工作，工作、学习和团结的都很好，他们对解放军培养了这样一批优秀干部表示感谢。
