    Crossing the Party Ridge Mountain
    Lieutenant Colonel Liu Shuyuan
    (Essay from the Thirty-Year Collection of the Chinese People's Liberation Army)

    It was in 1935, I was only sixteen years old then, serving as a soldier in the Second Company of the Guard Battalion of the Red Fourth Front Army Headquarters, guarding Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and the headquarters leaders. In August, we came to Danba County on the border of Western Sichuan and Xikang. The troops only stayed in Danba County for two days. There, we prepared some dry food and straw sandals for the march, and then proceeded along the Greater Snowy Mountains towards Daofu and Luhuo areas.

    We walked for several days in the river valley area where our "feet were wet all day long," and then we arrived at the Party Ridge Mountain area. Looking from afar, we only saw a white expanse in the sky, with snow-capped mountains piercing the clouds. In the valley, the wind became cold, and the weather in August, which was hot on the plains, was as cold as winter here.

    It was almost dark when we reached the foot of the mountain.

    Party Ridge Mountain is at the northern end of the Zheduo Mountain, with an altitude of more than 5,800 meters. The mountain is covered with snow all year round, the air is thin, and there are no inhabitants. Below the mountain is a boundless primeval forest, with branches and leaves layered on top of each other, making it impossible to see the sky when you look up. Except for the local poor Tibetans who occasionally risk their lives to hunt or collect medicinal materials on the mountain, no one has ever walked through it. The local Tibetans say, "Alive in, dead out," but no one knows what the conditions are like on the snow mountain.

    The superiors ordered the troops to stop advancing and camp in the forest at the foot of the mountain, preparing to cross the snow mountain tomorrow.

    According to the place designated by the superiors, each company began to camp. Our group leader was from Huangpi, Hubei, and the comrades in the squad called him Old Huangpi. He was responsible for finding stones to build a stove and boiling water to cook food. The new soldier Lao Yang was responsible for picking up firewood to make a fire for warmth, and I was responsible for setting up the tent. The so-called tent was just a tattered cloth sheet hung on a tree branch; it could neither keep out the rain nor block the wind.

    Although the weather was very cold, we were still wearing single clothes, so everyone had to gather around the fire to keep warm. Some ate fried noodles, some roasted clothes, and some wiped their weapons; singing, guessing riddles, talking and laughing, the whole forest was filled with laughter and songs. At this moment, a burst of shouts suddenly came from the other side of the forest. We thought something had happened and ran over to see that there was a hot spring there, and the water was scalding hot. This made us very happy, and everyone took a comfortable and enjoyable bath here. This was the highest enjoyment imaginable at the time. The fatigue of the past few days was washed away by the hot spring.

    The next day, as soon as it was light, the bugle for advance sounded. We began to advance towards the snow mountain.

    Beside a winding path, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, wearing a gray uniform, stood there with a smile on his face. Like all of us, the Commander-in-Chief also carried a stick for climbing the snow mountain. He looked at us with a smile and said, "We will suffer today! The task is very difficult! Comrades, let's have a competition! See who doesn't fall behind." Every word of the Commander-in-Chief gave us great encouragement. As we walked past him, we straightened our chests and marched with extra vigor. The Commander-in-Chief looked at us, one by one, walking past with vigor, his face filled with smiles, as if he was very satisfied with us, and as if he was encouraging us to move forward bravely.

    Following the winding path, we didn't know how long we walked before we came out of the tall primeval forest and onto the snow mountain. Snowflakes fluttered in the air. As we walked higher and higher, the snow fell heavier and heavier. Before long, everyone was covered with snow from head to toe. Everything around us was white, and we couldn't see where the road was, or where the valleys and deep pits were. The troops in front had to follow the footprints of birds and animals, and the troops behind followed in the footsteps of the troops in front. One followed closely after another, and the footprints were getting deeper and deeper. By the time we passed, the footprints were already knee-deep. The mountain was very steep, and the snowballs loosened by the troops in front rolled down onto our heads and necks in heaps. After climbing a stretch of ice and snow-covered mountain road, when we looked back down, the tall forest where we had stayed last night was now at our feet, and the forest, which was as small as a cornfield, was still surrounded by wisps of smoke. We already felt that we had climbed very high, but we didn't know how far we were from the top of the mountain!

    The higher we climbed, the more our clothes were soaked with sweat. A thin layer of ice slowly formed on our clothes, and the hot air exhaled from our mouths and nostrils quickly condensed into water droplets hanging on our hair, eyebrows, and lips. The comrades joked, "Aha! We're wearing glass clothes and crystal hats."

    As we moved forward, the difficulties increased. The deep snow and cold wind stung our eyes. We all tied handkerchiefs around our foreheads to block the intense snow glare and the cold wind from stinging our eyes. Even so, our eyes were still stinging. On the path, the accumulated snow slowly melted and froze into ice, making the road slippery and difficult to walk on. Although everyone carried a stick, people kept falling. The straw sandals on our feet became heavier and heavier, and the heels were frozen with a layer of ice several centimeters thick. Someone joked again, "Our Red Army is not simple, we're all wearing high heels!" This laughter chased away the cold and fatigue.

    The marching speed gradually slowed down. More and more people fell. Some rolled under the snow rocks on the side of the road, and some fell into snow pits several people deep. The hardest were the muleteer comrades, who often fell into the ravines with their men and horses, and then had to help them up and catch up with the team. In this difficult moment, cadres, Party members, and League members all took the initiative to help each other with their physical strength. Our company commander, instructor, and platoon leader all carried several guns on their shoulders. In places where the livestock couldn't walk, the comrades carried the things on the livestock on their shoulders. Some sick comrades also participated in carrying things and rescuing livestock. What moved us the most was that the headquarters leaders were suffering just like us. Commander-in-Chief Zhu, like us, stepped through the deep snow, leaned on his stick, and walked uphill step by step with great difficulty. When he saw us, Commander-in-Chief Zhu also encouraged us, "Keep going! We're almost at the top of the mountain." No one wanted the Commander-in-Chief to worry about us. Each squad took up the competition to see who wouldn't fall behind. We walked and sang, played games, and guessed riddles. Although the environment was harsh, the morale of the troops was still very high.

    Beside a snow rock, a horse from the battalion headquarters rolled under the snow rock. The platoon leader sent our group to help the animal caretaker rescue the horse. We struggled for a long time before we rescued the horse and the documents. But the horse slipped again on the path, blocking the road. Next to the road was a bottomless snow pit, and the troops behind had to pass by the edge of the snow rock. Because so many people passed by, the accumulated snow on the edge of the rock slowly melted. When our group leader, Old Huangpi, untied the documents from the horse and carried them over, he unfortunately slipped and fell into the snow pit. The snow on the edge of the rock rolled down with him, and he was buried in the deep snow. Our group leader, Old Huangpi, thus rested forever on the snow mountain for the happiness of the Chinese people. Tears froze into snowflakes on our faces, and grief struck heavily at our hearts. We had rejoiced together for victory, and encouraged each other in times of difficulty, and now we were saying goodbye forever. I carried his small Mauser rifle, waved goodbye to him silently in the face of the roaring cold wind, and then, together with Lao Yang, continued to move forward towards the summit with difficult steps.

    Only a few miles from the summit. The snow fell even heavier, and the raging wind whipped up clumps of snow, rushing towards us fiercely, making it impossible to open our eyes or mouth. The cold air became thinner and thinner, and breathing became more and more difficult. People were also particularly tired, their bodies were weak and powerless, and they had to gasp for breath after taking a step, with a heavy and stuffy feeling in their chest, wanting to vomit; their limbs were almost numb, and their bodies were swaying, wanting to lie down at any time. How good it would be to be able to lie down and rest for a while at this time! But we couldn't. I kept urging myself in my heart: "Persist a little longer, take a few more steps, don't sit down, don't sit down!" I used almost all my strength to move those soft and painful legs that seemed to be locked with iron chains. The most stubborn porters and radio operators were now unable to go on. They were so overwhelmed by the dozens of pounds of documents and machines that they couldn't breathe, and some collapsed on the snow, never to get up again. When the comrades in front fell, the people behind took over the burdens and continued to move forward. Gradually, more and more comrades were exhausted and frozen, some were buried in the snow and parted ways with us forever. Some were still looking at their comrades, handing over the guns wrapped in cloth and held in their arms to the comrades who could still walk. From their eyes, we could see that they still wanted to say something, but their lips moved, and they couldn't speak, only panting heavily. We had to turn red eyes, silently take the guns, and continue to move forward. The deaths of our comrades did not shake our confidence and determination to win, on the contrary, everyone's heart was filled with infinite hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries. For the future victory, we must live on! In order to preserve the revolutionary forces, we must break through the wind and snow and cross Party Ridge Mountain!

    At about four o'clock in the afternoon, we finally climbed to the summit. We had made it, we had won. We were happier than if we had won a battle, although we couldn't shout or sing, but everyone could see what each other wanted to say in their hearts. None of us stopped or sat down to rest. The vanguard troops had already gone far away, and there were only some of us who were weak and had fallen behind, and the rear troops, on the top of the mountain. All around us, there was nothing but snow.

    When we went down the mountain, we suddenly became energetic and took very quick steps. Before long, the weather suddenly changed, and torrential rain and hailstones lashed down on us. We hurriedly covered our heads with enamel basins and iron shovels. The most comfortable and safest were the cooks, who put large iron pots on their heads and ran down the mountain nonchalantly. The hailstones and bean-sized raindrops hit the enamel basins and iron pots, clanging and crackling, like firecrackers on New Year's Eve, one after another. Some comrades who were weak and overworked sacrificed themselves in the hailstorm.

    It was getting dark, the hail gradually stopped, and the torrential rain was still falling fiercely. We were far behind the troops, and we were very anxious. Everyone hurried forward, taking two steps at a time. In some steep places, we wrapped ourselves in cloth sheets and rolled down with our guns in our arms. Our bodies were covered with snow, and our clothes were soaked. We got up, shook off the snow, and ran down desperately. When the road was flatter, we ran with the last of our breath.

    We ran to a grove of trees, and it was so dark that we couldn't see the road, and everyone was exhausted. There happened to be a Tibetan slate house by the road, so we decided to "live" here. The door of the slate house was tightly closed, and we did not disturb the Tibetans, but lit a bonfire next to it to keep warm. The ice and snow on our clothes slowly melted when roasted by the fire, and our whole bodies steamed with heat, all misty. We sat around the fire, eating dry food and talking about climbing the snow mountain today, and mourning the comrades who were resting on the snow mountain.

    Perhaps our actions in strictly abiding by the mass discipline touched the Tibetans. Late at night, an old Tibetan woman came out. She was very moved when she saw that we were still wearing wet single clothes and snow-covered straw sandals, and our whole bodies were steaming with moisture. She spoke and gestured towards her house. We didn't understand what she was saying, but from her expression and gestures, she wanted us to go to her house to live in. We also said and gestured to thank her for her kindness, and advised her to go back to rest. We sat outside all night, and although the weather was so cold, we slept very soundly by the fire.

    Early the next morning, we went down Party Ridge Mountain. At noon, in Daofu County, I returned to my company, and followed the troops to Luhuo County.

    横跨党岭山	中校　刘树远	（中国人民解放军三十年征文）
    还在1935年，那时我才十六岁，在红四方面军总部警卫营二连当战士，警卫朱德总司令和总部首长。8月间，我们从西康来到川康交界的丹巴县。部队在丹巴县只逗留了两天。在那里，准备了一些行军的干粮和草鞋，就又沿着大雪山脉，向道孚、炉霍地区前进了。
    我们在“整日脚不干”的河谷地带走了好几天，就到了党岭山区。远远望去，只看到天边白茫茫的一片，雪山高插入云霄。山谷里，风也变冷了，8月的天气，平原上正热着呢，这里却冷得像冬天。
    天快黑的时候，到了山脚下。
    党岭山在折多山的北端，海拔五千八百多公尺。山上终年积雪，空气稀薄，渺无人烟。山下一片望不到边际的原始森林，树枝树叶层层复盖，抬头看不见天。除了当地的贫苦藏民偶尔冒着生命危险上山打猎或采集药材外，从来没有人走过。当地藏民们传说：“活的进去，死的出来”，但谁也不知道雪山上的情况到底怎么样。
    上级命令部队停止前进，就在山下森林里宿营，准备明天过雪山。
    按着上级指定的地方，各连开始宿营。我们小组长是湖北黄陂人，班里同志都喊他黄陂老。他负责找石块垒炉子，烧水煮饭吃。新战士老杨负责拾柴烧火取暖，我就负责搭帐棚。所谓帐棚，就是把一床破旧的布单子往树枝上一挂，就成了；它既不能挡雨，也不能遮风。
    天气虽然很冷，我们身上还穿着单衣，大家只好围着火堆烤火。有的吃炒面，有的烤衣服，有的擦拭武器；唱歌的，猜谜的，说说笑笑，整个森林里洋溢着欢笑和歌声。正在这时候，从树林那边，突然传来一阵喊叫声。我们以为发生了什么事，跑过去一看，原来那里有一口温泉，水热得烫人。这一下，我们可高兴了，大家舒舒服服、痛痛快快地在这里大洗了一番。这在当时，是意想不到的最高享受了。几天来的疲劳，都被滚热的温泉冲洗掉了。
    第二天天刚大亮，前进号就底底达达地响了。我们开始向雪山前进。
    在一个弯曲的小路旁，朱总司令穿着一身灰色军装，面带笑容地站在那里。跟我们大家一样，总司令手里也带了一根爬雪山用的棍子。他微笑地看着我们说：“今天要吃苦啊！任务很艰难哪！同志们，咱们比赛吧！看谁不掉队。”总司令的每句话，都给了我们莫大的鼓舞。我们走过他面前，胸部格外挺起，脚迈得特别有劲。总司令看着我们一个个精神充沛地走过去，脸上更是堆满了笑容，像是对我们很满意，又像是在鼓励我们勇敢向前。
    顺着弯曲的小道，也不知走了多久，我们穿出了高大的原始森林，走到雪山上来了。空中纷纷扬扬地飘起雪花来。渐走渐高，雪也愈下愈大。不多久，每个人从头到脚都积满了雪。四外白茫茫一片，也看不清哪是道路，哪是山谷和深坑。前面的部队只好顺着鸟兽的足印走，后面的部队就踏着前面部队的脚印走。一个紧跟一个，脚印越踩越深，待我们走过时，脚印已经深到膝盖了。山很陡，前头部队踩松了的雪团，成堆成块地滚到我们头上和脖子里。爬了一阵冰雪铺成的山路，再回头往下看看，昨夜我们住过的高大森林，现在已在我们的脚底下，那小得像一座包谷林似的森林上空，还萦绕着朵朵烟云。我们已觉得爬得很高了，但距离山顶还不知有多远哩！
    山愈爬愈高，汗水把衣服都浸透了。衣服上慢慢结成一层薄冰，嘴里鼻孔里呼出来的热气，很快就结成水珠子挂在头发上、眉毛上和嘴唇边。同志们开着玩笑说：“啊哈！咱们穿上玻璃衣，戴上水晶帽子了。”
    往前走，困难愈来愈多。深雪和冷风刺得人睁不开眼睛。我们都用手帕扎在额上，阻挡强烈的雪光和冷风对眼睛的刺射。虽然这样，但眼睛还是被刺得生痛。小路上，积雪慢慢被踩化了，冻成了冰，路变得滑溜溜的寸步难行，虽然每个人都带有一根棍子，但还是不断的有人摔跟头。脚上的草鞋愈来愈重，鞋后跟也冻结了一层几公分厚的冰。不知是谁又在开玩笑：“咱们红军可不简单，都穿上高跟鞋啦！”这一来，寒冷、疲劳，又被笑声冲跑了。
    行军速度逐渐慢下来。摔倒的人更多了。有人滚到路边的雪岩底下，有人掉进了几人深的雪坑。最苦的要算是马夫同志了，他们常常连人带马一起摔进山沟里，然后还要把它扶起来，赶队伍。在这困难的时刻，干部、党员、团员，都纷纷开展了体力互助。我们的连长、指导员、排长，肩上都扛了好几条枪。在牲口不能走的地方，同志们就把牲口身上的东西扛在肩上走。一些有病的同志也参加扛东西和抢救牲口。最使我们感动的是，总部首长也和我们一样在吃苦。朱总司令和我们一样，踏着深雪，拄着棍子，很吃力地一步一步往上走。见了我们，朱总司令还鼓励说：“加油啊！快到山顶了。”谁都不愿让总司令为我们操心。各个班挑起了竞赛，看谁不掉队。我们一边走，一边唱歌，碰球，猜谜语，环境虽苦，部队的情绪仍然很活跃。
    在一座雪岩边上，营部一匹牲口滚到雪岩下去了。排长派我们小组去帮助饲养员抢救牲口。我们费了好大劲，才把牲口和文件抢救上来。但牲口又滑倒在小路上，把路堵住了。路旁就是深不见底的雪坑，后面的部队只好从雪岩边上过去。由于过的人多，岩边上的积雪慢慢踩化了，等到小组长黄陂老同志解下牲口身上的文件，扛着过来的时候，不幸滑倒雪坑里去了。岩边上的雪随着一起往下滚，他被掩殁在深雪里。我们的小组长黄陂老同志，就这样为了中国人民的幸福，永远安息在雪山上了。泪水在我们脸上结成了雪花，悲痛沉重地捶击着我们的心，我们在一起共同为胜利而高兴过，在困难的时候互相鼓舞过，而今永别了。我扛起他的小马枪，迎着怒吼的冷风向他默默告别后，就和老杨一起，迈着艰难的脚步继续向顶峰前进。
    离山顶只几里了。雪下得更大，狂风卷起一团团的雪，向我们凶猛地扑过来，打得人睁不开眼，张不开嘴。冷空气也愈来愈稀薄，呼吸也愈来愈困难。人也特别疲倦，全身发软无力，走一步就得喘几口气，胸口上又压又闷，想呕吐；四肢冻得几乎失去了知觉，身子摇摇晃晃的，随时随地想躺下。这时候能够躺下来休息一会该多好啊！但是我们不能够。我心里一个劲地鼓动着自己：“再坚持一会，再坚持几步，不能坐下，不能坐下！”几乎用尽了全身的力量，才能移动那两条好像锁着铁链似的又软又痛的腿。最顽强的挑夫和电台工作的同志们，现在也不行了。他们被那几十斤重的文件和机器压得喘不过气来，有的累倒在雪地上，再也爬不起来。前面的同志倒下了，后面的人就接过担子，继续前进。渐渐地，被累倒、被冻僵的同志愈来愈多了。有些已被雪花埋住，与我们永别了。有些还望着同志们，把用布包好的抱在怀里的枪交给还能走的同志们。从他们眼睛里可以看出，他们还想最后说些什么，但只见嘴唇动，说不出声来，光是大口大口地喘气。我们只好红着眼，默默地接过枪，继续往前走。战友们的死并没有动摇我们的胜利信心和决心，相反，每个人的心里被激起了对国民党反动派的无限仇恨。为了将来的胜利，我们要活下去！为了保存革命力量，我们一定要冲出风雪，翻过党岭山！
    下午四点钟左右，我们终于爬到顶峰了。我们熬过来了，我们胜利了。我们心里比打了胜仗还高兴，虽然我们喊不出来，唱不出来，但大家都能看出彼此心里要说的话。我们谁也没有停止或坐下休息。先头部队已经走远了，山顶上只有我们一些体弱掉队的和后尾部队，四外除了雪，什么都看不到。
    下山时，我们变得突然有劲了，脚步迈得非常快。走不多久，气候突然起了变化，暴雨和冰雹淋头袭来。我们急忙用洋磁盆，铁铣盖住头。最舒服最保险的要算炊事员，他们把大铁锅顶在头上，满不在乎地往山下跑。冰雹和豆大的雨点打在磁盆和铁锅上，叮叮当当劈劈拍拍地直响，好像旧历年除夕夜的鞭炮一样，连珠不断。又有些虚弱劳累过度的同志，在雨雹袭击中牺牲了。
    天快黑了，冰雹逐渐停止了，暴雨还在凶猛地下着。我们远远落在部队后面，心里都很焦急。大家两步并作一步地往前赶。在一些陡削的地方，我们就裹着布单、夹着枪朝下滚。全身沾满了雪，衣服也淋透了，爬起来，抖掉身上的雪，又拚命往下滚。路平一些，就用最后的几口气跑步。
    我们跑到一丛树林边上，天已黑得看不清路，大家也都精疲力尽了。路旁恰好有一座藏民的石板房，于是我们就决定在这里“住”下来。石板房子的门紧关着，我们没有去惊动藏民，就在旁边烧起篝火取暖。衣服上的冰雪经火一烤，慢慢化了，全身往外冒热气，雾气腾腾的。我们围坐在火旁，边吃干粮，边谈论着今天爬雪山的事，心里悼念着安息在雪山上的战友们。
    大概是我们严格遵守群众纪律的行动感动了藏民，深夜，一位藏族老太太走出来。她看到我们还穿着湿透的单衣和沾满雪的草鞋，全身冒湿气，很是感动。她一边说着，一边往她的房子比划着。我们不懂她说些什么，但从她的表情和比划上看，是要我们到她房子里去住。我们也边说边比划地谢谢她的好意，劝她回去休息。我们在外面坐了一夜，虽然天气那么冷，在火边上，我们还睡得很香甜。
    第二天一早，我们下了党岭山。中午，在道孚县，我回到了自己的连队，随着部队又向炉霍县前进。
