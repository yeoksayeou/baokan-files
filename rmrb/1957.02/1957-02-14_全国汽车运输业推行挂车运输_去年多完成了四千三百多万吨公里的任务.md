Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: As a result of the nationwide automobile transportation industry promoting the advanced experience of truck-trailer transport last year, the nation overfulfilled the transportation task by 43,393,587 ton-kilometers, equivalent to the annual transportation volume of 500 trucks with a load capacity of three tons.

Promoting trailer transport can not only partially compensate for transportation capacity and increase transportation volume, but is also an effective measure to save funds and reduce costs. Last year, units that promoted trailer transport generally reduced transportation costs by 10% to 20%; Beijing, Fujian, and other places reduced them by about 30%. The Beijing Automobile Transportation Company alone reduced costs by more than 300,000 yuan within half a year last year.

When promoting the experience of truck-trailer transport, transportation enterprises in various regions actively organized employees to use old and waste materials to manufacture trailers themselves, overcoming the difficulties of steel shortages and insufficient parts. The technical personnel of the Shenyang Automobile Transportation Company's Repair Plant adopted the method of "designing according to materials," extensively using old steel materials, and reduced the cost of each trailer from 3,313 yuan to 2,833 yuan while ensuring quality. The Hunan Provincial Transportation Bureau used the beams, front and rear axles, and chassis of various scrapped vehicles, as well as some short and miscellaneous steel materials, to manufacture 75 trailers after processing. Recently, the Beijing Transportation Company successfully trial-produced a trailer made of wood, which can save 107 kilograms of steel per vehicle.

    全国汽车运输业推行挂车运输
    去年多完成了四千三百多万吨公里的任务
    新华社13日讯　全国汽车运输业去年推行汽车拖带挂车运输先进经验的结果，为国家多完成了四千三百三十九万三千五百八十七吨公里的运输任务，相当于五百辆载重三吨的货车一年所能完成的运输量。
    推行挂车运输不仅能部分地弥补运力、增加运量，同时也是一项节约资金、降低成本的有效措施。去年凡是推行挂车运输的单位，运输成本一般都降低10％到20％；北京、福建等地都降低30％左右，北京市仅汽车运输公司一个单位去年半年内就降低成本三十多万元。
    各地运输企业在推行汽车拖带挂车经验的时候，积极组织职工群众利用旧废料，自己动手制造挂车，克服钢材缺乏、机件不足的困难。沈阳汽车运输公司修配厂技术人员采用“依材设计”的办法，广泛利用旧钢材，在保证质量的基础上，每辆挂车的造价由三千三百一十三元降低到二千八百三十三元。湖南省运输局利用各种报废车辆的大梁、前后轴、车槽，以及一些短杂钢材，经过加工以后制造了七十五辆挂车。最近北京运输公司试制成功了一种利用木料制作的挂车，每辆车能节省一百零七公斤钢材。
