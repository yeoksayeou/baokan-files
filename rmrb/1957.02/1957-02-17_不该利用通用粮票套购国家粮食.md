    Should Not Exploit Universal Grain Coupons to Obtain State Grain
    Some members of the Qian Baiyang Agricultural Cooperative in Shangjie Township, Xingyang County, Henan Province, received national universal grain coupons sent back by their relatives working in other places before the Spring Festival, asking them to use these coupons to buy some grain to eat. I believe that this is an act that undermines the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and should be severely prohibited.
    Grain unified purchase and sale work has now been carried out nationwide. Members of agricultural cooperatives (or individual farmers) have already retained their annual rations; even if individual households are short of grain, the state will try to make adjustments or determine their grain supply to ensure their consumption. If government cadres and workers have surplus grain coupons due to business trips, they should return them to the grain department and should not send the grain coupons home for their families to exploit them to obtain state grain. Qian Baiyang
    Tong Jincheng, a staff member of the Baqiao Engineering Office of the Xi'an Basic Construction Bureau, recently sent more than seventy kilograms of national universal grain coupons to his mother-in-law, who lives in Tuqiao Township, Guangji County, Hubei Province. In fact, the agricultural cooperative has already left six hundred kilograms of grain for his mother-in-law this year, which is more than enough for the old lady to eat. Now, she has transferred the grain coupons to others, and others are using these grain coupons to do business elsewhere.
    National universal grain coupons are for the state to take care of people who are mobile due to work needs. Comrade Tong Jincheng sent the grain coupons to relatives who live permanently in rural areas, and it has already created a bad influence. It is hoped that he will not do this again in the future.

### 不该利用通用粮票套购国家粮食

    不该利用通用粮票套购国家粮食
    河南省荥阳县上街乡前白杨农业社的一些社员，在春节之前收到他们在外地工作的亲属寄回来的全国通用粮票，让他们用这些粮票去买些粮食吃。我认为这是破坏国家粮食统购统销政策的行为，应该受到严厉禁止。
    现在全国范围内都进行了粮食统购统销工作，农业社的社员（或个体农民）已经留下了他们全年的口粮；即使有个别户缺粮，国家也设法进行调剂或确定了对他们的粮食供应量，保证了他们的食用。如果机关干部、工人有出差而节余的粮票，应该把它交回给粮食部门，不应把粮票寄回家，让家里的人去套购国家的粮食。　前白杨
    西安基本建设局坝桥工程处工作人员童金成，最近给他住在湖北省广济县土桥乡的岳母寄来了七十几斤全国通用粮票。其实，今年农业社里已经给他的岳母留了六百斤粮食，老太太一个人是吃不完的。现在，她已把粮票转送给人，而别人又利用这些粮票到外面作生意去了。
    全国通用粮票，是国家为了照顾一些因工作需要而在外流动的人使用的。童金成同志把粮票寄给了常住在农村的亲属，而且已经造成不好的影响，希望他今后不要再是这样做。　仲芳
