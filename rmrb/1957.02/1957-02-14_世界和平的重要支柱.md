    Important Pillar of World Peace
    Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Qian Junrui
    The "Joint Sino-Soviet Statement" signed on January 18th this year by Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, pointed out with great satisfaction: "Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in 1950, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union have greatly developed, and the people of the two countries have always been united as one. The facts of the past few years have proved that the great Sino-Soviet alliance and the unbreakable unity of the two countries are an important pillar of world peace." The Sino-Soviet relations and the development of the world situation over the past seven years have fully confirmed the correctness of the above assertion.
    Why are the people of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, able to remain united as one, and why can the friendly cooperation between the two countries be continuously and infinitely consolidated and developed? This is because, as the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed seven years ago pointed out, "the consolidation of good-neighborly relations and friendship between China and the Soviet Union is in accordance with the fundamental interests of the people of both countries." The relationship between China and the Soviet Union, like the relationship between all countries in the socialist camp, is based on the principles of Marxist-Leninist internationalism and national equality, and this relationship is subordinate to the supreme interests of the common struggle against imperialism and the common cause of communism. This new type of international relation is fundamentally different from the old type of international relations in the imperialist camp, which is characterized by the strong bullying the weak, the big oppressing the small, and mutual deception. The "Eisenhower Doctrine," which has been loudly trumpeted by American monopoly capital recently, is a typical renovation of that old type of international relation. As for the mutual relations between socialist countries, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance stipulated as early as seven years ago: "The Contracting Parties undertake to develop and consolidate economic and cultural ties between China and the Soviet Union in the spirit of friendship and cooperation, and in accordance with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, to render each other all possible economic assistance, and to carry out necessary economic cooperation." (Article 5 of the Treaty) The Declaration of the Soviet Government of October 30, 1956 on the foundations for the development and further strengthening of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the Statement of the Chinese Government of November 1 of the same year supporting this declaration of the Soviet Government, and the several joint statements successively issued by socialist countries in recent months, have all unanimously pointed out that relations between socialist countries should be based on the principles of complete equality, mutual respect for territorial integrity, national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. Only such international relations, which are in accordance with the national interests of all countries and the supreme interests of the common cause of human progress and peace, can be truly continuously developed and consolidated, and can withstand all tests from the outside or the inside. The sincere unity and friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union over the past seven years are a shining example of this new type of international relation (the influence of this international relation and the principles on which this relation is based is expanding day by day).
    Naturally, the people of China and the Soviet Union are particularly pleased with the development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union in the past year. As everyone knows, the imperialist aggressor bloc, filled with beastly hatred for the great Sino-Soviet alliance, has used all its strength in the past year, taking advantage of the opportunity of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to expose and correct shortcomings and errors in its own work, taking advantage of the events in Poland, especially Hungary, and even taking advantage of the sympathy and support of the Soviet Union and China for Egypt's resistance to aggression, to slander the Soviet Union and provoke Sino-Soviet relations in every possible way. They fabricated and spread all kinds of shameless slanders about Sino-Soviet discord. They viciously cursed the "Moscow-Beijing axis," especially Mr. Dulles, the American Secretary of State, a disciple of Goebbels, who shouted the loudest, and he openly called on "free countries (should be read as imperialist countries) to maintain moral pressure, which helps to destroy the Soviet-Chinese communist system" in December last year.
    However, history is advancing according to its own logic. Has the "Moscow-Beijing axis" been broken? No. Not only has it not been broken, but it has become more resilient. Has the "Soviet-Chinese communist system" been destroyed? No. Not only has it not been destroyed, but it has become stronger. Then what has been thoroughly exposed and shattered? It is the dirty conspiracies of the imperialists. As for Sino-Soviet friendly relations, they have taken a big step forward in the past year. The exchanges between the people of our two countries have become more frequent, our friendship has been further enhanced, and our cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields has become more extensive and closer. In 1956 alone, China and the Soviet Union signed eleven important agreements on economic and cultural cooperation. It should be emphasized that the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, visited our country in April last year and signed an agreement on further Soviet assistance to our country in developing certain industrial sectors, which gave new and significant impetus to our country's socialist economic construction. In July last year, the government delegations of China and the Soviet Union held negotiations in Moscow and signed the Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement, which opened up broad prospects for cultural and scientific cooperation between the two countries. In January this year, the Soviet cultural delegation headed by Comrade Mikhailov, Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, visited our country and held negotiations with our delegation and signed the 1957 Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Implementation Plan, which put the cause of Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation on a more systematic and planned path. What particularly grieved the imperialists and reactionaries of all countries was that China and the Soviet Union adopted a completely consistent attitude in dealing with the Polish and Hungarian events. The talks between the government delegations of China and the Soviet Union in Moscow in January this year and the "Joint Sino-Soviet Statement" issued after the talks powerfully dealt a fatal blow to the imperialists' conspiracy to undermine Sino-Soviet unity. This joint statement pointed out unequivocally: "In the course of a wide-ranging exchange of views, the parties to the talks reached a complete consensus on the current international situation and important international issues." What does this show? This shows that all attempts by the imperialists to provoke Sino-Soviet relations are doomed to failure.
      The great Sino-Soviet alliance is an important pillar of world peace and the just cause of mankind. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance stipulates that the two countries strengthen friendship and cooperation to "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or any other State which may unite with Japan directly or indirectly in acts of aggression, and are anxious to consolidate lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Organization." After the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea in 1950, undermining peace in the Far East, the Chinese people, with the support of the Soviet Union, carried out the great war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and together with the heroic Korean people, finally defeated the American aggressors, defended the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and defended peace in the Far East. At the Geneva Conference in 1954, China and the Soviet Union, together with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, joined hands to make a significant contribution to the restoration of peace in Indochina. In November 1956, the heroic Soviet army, with the support of China and other socialist countries, put down the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary instigated by imperialism, saved the socialist cause of the Hungarian people, and shattered the imperialists' plan to turn Hungary into a new advanced base for world war. In late October and early November last year, when Britain, France and Israel launched a war of aggression against Egypt, the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries, as well as the people of the world, strongly condemned the aggressive acts of Britain, France, and Israel, and warmly sympathized with and supported the heroic resistance of the Egyptian army and people. The serious warnings issued by the Soviet Union to Britain and France played a significant role in stopping the British and French aggression against Egypt. In addition, over the past few years, China and the Soviet Union have made joint efforts to establish and enhance friendly relations with independent national states on the principle of peaceful coexistence, thereby establishing a vast area of peace with a population of 1.5 billion, greatly weakening the influence of the imperialist aggressor bloc. At the same time, the Soviet Union and China have consistently struggled side by side for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the easing of international tensions, and the defense of world peace. All these facts show that the invincible Sino-Soviet alliance is the most powerful and reliable defender of the cause of world peace and the just cause of mankind. Comrade Mao Zedong said not long after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance: "The unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union... will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice in the world." History is increasingly clearly confirming this great prediction.
    The great Sino-Soviet alliance is sacred and inviolable, and is absolutely unshakable. Because it not only concerns the long-term and fundamental interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also concerns the long-term and fundamental interests of all mankind. It is one of the most important keys determining the fate of all mankind - peace or war, progress or regression, justice or evil, happiness or disaster. Any wavering in this regard is a violation of internationalism and patriotism, and is a betrayal of the national interests and the interests of all mankind. For every member of the socialist camp, we must resolutely consolidate and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; neutrality or fence-sitting is absolutely impossible. Therefore, our task lies in: "China and the Soviet Union will further develop mutual assistance and cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields in the future, make every effort to safeguard and strengthen the unity of socialist countries, and continue to unite all peace-loving countries and peoples in striving for lasting world peace." ("Joint Sino-Soviet Statement") We clearly know that the enemy will never be reconciled to their failure. The forces of aggression and regression will never automatically and docilely give way to the forces of peace and justice. They will inevitably continue to slander and undermine our friendly unity in every possible way. Therefore, we must also maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times. However, the Chinese people firmly believe that there is absolutely no force in the world that can stop our victorious advance, and we will surely achieve our own goals.

    世界和平的重要支柱
    中苏友好协会总会秘书长　钱俊瑞
    今年1月18日由我国周恩来总理和苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁所签署的“中苏联合声明”曾经极为满意地指出：“自从1950年中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结以来，中苏两国的友好合作关系有了巨大的发展，两国人民始终如一地团结一致。几年来的事实证明，伟大的中苏同盟和两国牢不可破的团结是世界和平的一个重要支柱。”七年来的中苏关系和世界局势的发展完全证实了上述论断的正确性。
    为什么我们中苏两国人民能够始终团结一致，两国的友好合作能够不断地而且无限地巩固和发展呢？这是因为，正像七年前签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约所指出的，我们两国之间的“亲善邦交与友谊的巩固是与中苏两国人民的根本利益相符合的”。中苏两国之间的关系，和所有社会主义阵营各国之间的关系一样，是以马克思列宁主义的国际主义原则和民族平等原则为基础的，这种关系服从于反对帝国主义的共同斗争和共产主义的共同事业的最高利益。这种新型的国际关系根本不同于那种以强凌弱、以大欺小、尔虞我诈的如同帝国主义阵营中旧式的国际关系。最近美国垄断资本所大吹大擂的“艾森豪威尔主义”就是那种旧式的国际关系经过翻新了的典型。至于社会主义国家之间的相互关系，那么正像早在七年以前中苏友好同盟互助条约所规定了的：“双方保证以友好合作的精神，并遵照平等、互利、互相尊重国家主权与领土完整及不干涉对方内政的原则，发展和巩固中苏两国之间的经济与文化关系，彼此给予一切可能的经济援助，并进行必要的经济合作。”（条约第五条）1956年10月30日苏联政府发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言和同年11月1日我国政府发表的关于支持苏联政府这个宣言的声明，以及几个月来社会主义各国先后发表的几个联合声明，都曾一致地指出，社会主义各国之间的关系应该以完全平等、相互尊重领土完整、国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政的原则为基础。只有这样的符合于各国的民族利益和人类进步与和平的共同事业的最高利益的国际关系才能真正地不断发展和巩固，并且经得起一切来自外部的或者内部的考验。而七年以来的中苏两国的真诚团结和友好合作的关系乃是这种新型国际关系（这种国际关系和这种关系所赖以建立的原则的影响正在日益扩大）的光辉范例。
    十分自然，中苏两国人民对于最近一年来中苏友好合作关系的发展感到特别地高兴。大家知道，对于伟大的中苏同盟充满着兽性的仇恨的帝国主义侵略集团，一年以来曾经使尽了一切力气，利用苏联共产党二十次大会揭露和纠正自己工作中的缺点和错误的机会，利用波兰特别是匈牙利的事件，甚至利用苏联和中国对埃及反抗侵略的同情支援，百般地诽谤苏联和挑拨中苏关系。他们制造和散布了种种所谓中苏不和的无耻谰言。他们恶毒地咒骂“莫斯科—北京轴心”，特别是那位戈培尔的徒弟美国国务卿杜勒斯先生嚷得最起劲，他在去年12月曾经公开号召“自由国家（应该读作帝国主义国家）必须保持道义的压力，这种压力有助于破坏苏联—中国共产主义体系”。
    但是，历史是在按着它自己的逻辑前进。“莫斯科—北京轴心”究竟被打断了没有呢？没有。不但没有，反而更坚韧了。“苏联—中国共产主义体系”有没有被破坏了呢？没有。不但没有，反而更壮实了。那么什么东西倒被彻底揭穿和粉碎了呢？是帝国主义者的那些肮脏的阴谋诡计。至于中苏友好关系，一年以来又大大地跨进一步。我们两国人民的来往更加频繁了，友谊更加增进了，在政治、经济、文化各方面的合作是越加广泛和密切了。仅仅1956年，中苏之间就签订了十一个有关经济和文化合作的重要协定。应该着重指出的，去年4月间以苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬同志为首的苏联政府代表团访问我国，签订了一个关于苏联进一步援助我国发展某些工业部门的协定，对我国的社会主义经济建设又给了新的重大的推动力量。去年7月经过中苏两国政府代表团在莫斯科的谈判，签订了中苏文化合作协定，开拓了中苏两国文化科学合作的广阔远景。今年1月间以苏联文化部部长米哈伊洛夫同志为首的苏联文化代表团访问我国，并和我国代表团进行谈判，签订了1957年的中苏文化合作执行计划，这样就使中苏文化合作的事业走上了更有系统更有计划的道路。特别使帝国主义者和各国反动派痛心疾首的，是中苏两国在对待波兰事件和匈牙利事件上采取了完全一致的态度。今年1月间中苏两国政府代表团在莫斯科的会谈和会谈后发表的“中苏联合声明”，特别有力地给帝国主义者破坏中苏团结的阴谋以致命的打击。这个联合声明，斩钉截铁地指出：“在广泛的交换意见的过程中，会谈双方对目前国际局势和重要的国际问题取得完全一致的看法。”这说明了什么呢？这说明了帝国主义者的一切妄图挑拨中苏关系的作为决然是徒劳的。
      伟大的中苏同盟乃是世界和平与人类正义事业的重要支柱。中苏友好同盟互助条约规定了两国加强友好和合作，以“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略，亟愿依据联合国组织的目标和原则，巩固远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全”。在1950年美帝国主义者发动了侵朝战争，破坏了远东和平以后，中国人民在苏联的支持下，进行了伟大的抗美援朝的斗争，和英勇的朝鲜人民一道，终于打败了美国侵略者，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，保卫了远东的和平。在1954年的日内瓦会议上，中苏两国又和越南民主共和国一道，手携手地为恢复印度支那的和平，作出了重大的贡献。1956年11月间，英勇的苏联军队在中国和社会主义各国的支持下，扑灭了由帝国主义所策动的匈牙利的反革命暴乱，挽救了匈牙利人民的社会主义事业，粉碎了帝国主义者想把匈牙利变成新的世界战争前哨阵地的计划。去年10月底和11月初，当英、法和以色列发动侵埃战争的时候，苏联、中国和各社会主义国家以及全世界人民都强烈地谴责英、法、以的侵略行为，热烈地同情和支持埃及军民的英勇抗战。而苏联对英、法所提出的严重警告，对于制止英法对埃及的侵略起了重大的作用。此外，几年以来中苏两国共同努力用和平共处的原则和各个民族独立国家建立和增进了友好关系，从而建立了广大的拥有十五亿人口的和平地区，极大地削弱了帝国主义侵略集团的影响。同时，苏中两国又一贯地为着裁减军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器，为着缓和国际紧张局势，保卫世界和平而并肩斗争。这一切事实都说明了，无敌的中苏友好同盟，是世界和平事业和人类正义事业的最有力和最可靠的保卫者。毛泽东同志在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订以后不久就说：“中苏两大国人民的团结……不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”历史正在越来越清楚地证实这个伟大的预见。
    伟大的中苏友好同盟是神圣不可侵犯的，是决然不可动摇的。因为它不仅关涉到中苏两国人民的长远的根本的利益，而且关涉到全人类的长远的根本的利益。它是决定全人类命运——和平还是战争、进步还是倒退、正义还是邪恶、幸福还是灾祸的一个最重要的关键。在这方面的任何动摇，就是对国际主义和爱国主义的违反，就是对民族利益和全人类利益的背弃。对于社会主义阵营的每个成员来说，我们必须坚决地巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，中立或者骑墙是断乎不可的。因此，我们的任务就在于：“中苏两国今后将进一步发展两国在政治、经济、文化各方面的互助合作关系，尽一切努力来保卫和加强社会主义各国的团结，并且继续联合一切爱好和平的国家和人民努力争取世界的持久和平。”（“中苏联合声明”）我们清楚地知道，敌人决不会甘心于自己的失败。侵略和倒退的势力决不会自动地和驯服地让位于和平和正义的力量。他们必然要继续千方百计地中伤和破坏我们的友好团结。因此，我们又必须时刻保持着高度的警惕。但是，中国人民深深相信，世界上决没有任何力量可以阻挡我们的胜利前进，我们一定能够达到我们自己的目的。
