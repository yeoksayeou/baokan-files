Xinhua News Agency, February 10th News: TASS reported on February 9th: The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote to the British Prime Minister Macmillan on February 2nd, expressing the hope that he could visit the Soviet Union this May or at another time.

The agreement regarding the British Prime Minister's visit to the Soviet Union was arranged between Soviet leaders and the then British Prime Minister Eden in July of last year.

Bulganin's letter was a reply to a letter from Macmillan dated January 28th. In his letter, Macmillan stated that due to his extremely busy schedule, he was concerned that he would not be able to visit the Soviet Union as scheduled in May of this year.

Bulganin's reply stated, "My colleagues and I still believe that direct contact with the leaders of the British state is of great significance and is an important factor in Anglo-Soviet relations. In this regard, our starting point is that these relations should develop in a positive direction, with a view to benefiting both our countries and improving the overall international situation.

It goes without saying that the agreement reached in the past with your predecessor, Sir Eden, regarding the British Prime Minister's visit to Moscow remains valid, and we welcome your visit to Moscow this May. If Your Excellency is unable to visit the Soviet Union during this period, we would like to know your opinion on another time that would be acceptable to you for a visit, and we can discuss new dates again.

We believe that a meeting with Your Excellency in Moscow could provide an opportunity for a useful exchange of views on issues directly related to Anglo-Soviet relations and other issues involving the interests of both parties."

    布尔加宁再次邀请英首相访苏
    表示英苏关系应当向良好方向发展
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社9日报道：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在2月2日写信给英国首相麦克米伦，希望他能够在今年5月或者在别的时候来苏联访问。
    关于英国首相访问苏联的协议，是去年7月间苏联领导人和当时的英国首相艾登商定的。
    布尔加宁的这封信是对麦克米伦1月28日的一封来信的答复。麦克米伦在信中表示，由于他的工作极忙，他担心他将不能如期在今年5月访问苏联。
    布尔加宁的回信中说，“我的同事和我仍旧认为，同英国国家领导人的直接接触具有重大意义，认为这是英苏关系中的一项重要因素。在这方面我们的出发点是，这种关系应当向着良好的方向发展，以期有利于我们两国和改善整个国际局势。
    用不着说，过去同您的前任者艾登爵士达成的英国首相访问莫斯科的协议依然有效，我们欢迎阁下在今年5月访问莫斯科。如果阁下不能在这个时期访问苏联，我们希望了解阁下对阁下可以接受的另一访问时间的意见，我们可以再次磋商新日期。
    我们相信，同阁下在莫斯科会见，可以提供机会，就英苏直接关系问题以及牵涉双方利益的其他问题进行有益的意见交换。”
