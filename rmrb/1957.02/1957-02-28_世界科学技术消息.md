    Camera that Simultaneously Takes Color and Black and White Photos
    Recently in Moscow, a unique camera named "Victory" has appeared. It has two lens housings, capable of simultaneously taking color and black and white photos, or two photos with different light sensitivities. It does not require rolling the film, and can continuously capture two scenes, which makes it particularly interesting to sports photography and aerial photography enthusiasts.
    This camera also has another feature. A lens turret is installed in the lens section of the camera, with several lenses of different focal lengths mounted on the turret. Thus, when the photographer needs a certain focal length lens, he only needs to turn the turret.
    Lightweight Wireless Telephone
    The complete equipment for a wireless telephone can be placed inside a regular telephone headset, with a small stick extending from the headset to serve as an antenna. This lightweight wireless telephone was recently invented in the United States.
    This wireless telephone does not require a power source. Because when a person speaks into the transmitter, the sound vibrates the air, generating an electric current through a special device. This current is sufficient to maintain the operation of the "radio station."
    The effective range of this wireless telephone is not long, and it can be used as a tool for work team leaders and workers to communicate in fields or construction sites.
    Automatically Opening and Closing Umbrella
    A recently produced automatic opening and closing umbrella in West Germany is particularly popular with consumers. When people use this umbrella, they only need to hold it and tap it on the ground or against a wall with one hand, and it will open. To close it, just press a button on the handle with your finger, and it will close automatically. Thus, if a person is holding something in one hand, the other hand can easily open and close the umbrella.
    Nylon Paper
    A college in Leicester, England, recently successfully trial-produced a type of nylon paper. This paper cannot be torn by hand, does not get damp, and is not afraid of chemical contamination. If it is buried, it will not rot.
    In addition to being used to preserve important documents, it can also be used as insulation for submarine cables and for packaging various chemical products.

    同时拍摄彩色和黑白照片的摄影机
    莫斯科最近出现了一种奇异的被命名为“胜利牌”的照相机。它有两个镜箱，可以同时拍摄彩色和黑白或是两种感光度不同的照片。它不用卷动胶卷，就可以连续摄取两个场面，这使体育摄影和空中摄影爱好者特别感到兴趣。
    这种照相机还有另外一个特点。在照相机的镜头部分装着一个镜头盘，盘上装着几个焦距不同的镜头。这样，当摄影师需要某种焦距镜头的时候，只需把盘一转就行。
    轻便的无线电话机
    一个无线电话机的全部设备可以放在一个普通的电话耳机里，从耳机内伸出一根小棒就可以作为天线。这种轻便的无线电话机不久前已经在美国创制出来。
    这种无线电话机不需要电源。因为当人对送话器讲话的时候，声音就震动空气，经过一种特殊装置，产生出电流，这些电流足够维持这个“电台”的工作。
    这种无线电话机的有效距离不长，可以用作田地中或是工地上工作队长和工人联系的工具。
    自动开闭的洋伞
    西德最近生产的一种自动开闭的洋伞特别受到消费者的喜爱。人们使用这种洋伞的时候，只要一只手握住它在地上或墙上一顶，它就能张开。如果要闭合它，只要用手指按一下把柄上的一个纽，它就能自动闭合。这样，如果一个人一只手拿着物件，另一只手完全可以很轻易地张伞闭伞。
    尼龙纸
    英国列斯特一个学院最近试制成功一种尼龙纸。这种纸用手揉不碎，不会发潮，不怕化学药物染污。如果把它埋藏起来它也不腐烂。
    除了可以用它来保存重要文件以外，还可以用它来作海底电线的绝缘体和包装各种化学制品。
