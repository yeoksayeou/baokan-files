Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th. The Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently decided to rectify the province's newspapers and periodicals.

Based on the principle of saving paper and improving the quality of newspapers and periodicals, the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department conducted a review of the province's newspapers and periodicals and proposed that, in addition to the "Shanxi Daily," "Shanxi Peasant Newspaper," "Shanxi Youth Newspaper," "Shanxi Pictorial," "Trade Union Work Bulletin," and "Journal of Shanxi Normal College," and eighteen other newspapers and periodicals that could continue to be published, the "Civil Affairs Bulletin," "Shanxi Grain Industry," "Culture Bulletin," and thirty other publicly or internally distributed newspapers and periodicals should be discontinued. Factory and mine newspapers published by the Party committees of factories and mines that are well-run and have a certain amount of dedicated editorial staff may continue to be published; substandard factory and mine newspapers should be discontinued. All newspapers published by various exploration teams within the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau system should be discontinued. County newspapers should continue to be published.

Prior to this, there were approximately six hundred publicly and internally distributed newspapers and periodicals in Shanxi Province. More than forty newspapers and periodicals were published by provincial-level agencies and organizations, with almost every department publishing a newspaper or periodical. The Shanxi Provincial Bureau of Culture even published four publications: "Culture Bulletin," "Cultural Life," "Film Communication," and "Song of Rapid Currents." Sixty-seven industrial and mining enterprises in Taiyuan and Datong cities published newspapers. The province had ninety-nine county and suburban newspapers aimed at farmers. Yanggao and a dozen other counties even published three to five newspapers and periodicals such as "Literacy Communication" per county, with some counties even publishing more than ten. Many newspapers and periodicals were published without requesting permission or approval. Even more internal publications were produced by the special districts and municipal-level agencies. Many newspapers and periodicals lacked dedicated editorial staff, their leadership systems were not sound, their quality was low, and they constantly made mistakes.

    节约纸张提高报刊质量
    山西精简报纸刊物
    据新华社太原9日电　中共山西省委员会宣传部最近决定整顿全省的报纸和刊物。
    根据节约纸张、提高报刊质量的原则，省委宣传部对全省报纸、刊物作了一次检查，提出全省性的报刊除“山西日报”、“山西农民报”、“山西青年报”、“山西画报”、“工会工作通报”和“山西师范学院学报”等十八种报刊可以继续出版以外，“民政简报”、“山西粮工”、“文化通报”等三十种公开发行或内部发行的报刊一律停刊。各厂矿党委出版的厂矿小报，办得较好并有一定专职编辑力量的可以继续出版，不合标准的厂矿小报，一律停刊，华北煤田地质勘探局系统各勘探队出版的小报一律停刊。各县小报仍继续出版。
    在此以前，山西省公开发行和内部发行的报刊大约在六百种以上。省级各机关团体出版的报刊有四十多种，几乎每个部门都出有报刊。山西省文化局甚至出版了“文化通报”、“文化生活”、“电影通讯”和“激流之歌”等四种。太原、大同两市有六十七个工矿企业出有报纸。全省以农民为对象的有县报和郊区报九十九种。阳高等十几个县每县还出了“扫盲通讯”等报刊三种到五种，有的县甚至出了十多种。许多报纸和刊物都是未经请示批准而自行出版的。各专区和市级机关出的内部刊物更多。有许多报刊缺乏专职编辑人员，领导制度也不健全，质量不高，并且不断发生错误。
