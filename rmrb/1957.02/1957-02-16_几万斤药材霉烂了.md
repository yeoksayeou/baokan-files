    Tens of Thousands of Jin of Medicinal Herbs Have Molded

    The Shangqiu Special District Chinese Medicine Wholesale Department of the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has approximately 50,000 jin of Cyperus rotundus (a Chinese medicinal herb) piled up, of which 30,000 jin have already molded and deteriorated. These medicinal materials originally belonged to the Taikang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Medicinal Material Wholesale Department. Last October, they transported it to Shangqiu, intending to sell it to the Special District Chinese Medicine Wholesale Department. Because it did not meet the specifications, the Special District Wholesale Department did not want it. These medicinal materials were then piled up here, exposed to wind and rain, with no one paying attention. The warehouse management personnel notified the owner to manage it, and the Taikang County Medicinal Material Department sent someone to perfunctorily sun-dry a portion of it and then left. Now, these Cyperus rotundus are continuing to mold.

    Thirty thousand jin of Cyperus rotundus is worth more than 4,000 yuan (purchasing price of 14 cents per jin), and the market is currently very short of this medicinal material. However, the Taikang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative is watching these medicinal materials rot away.

    几万斤药材霉烂了
    河南省供销社商丘专区中药批发部，堆放着约五万斤香附子（中药材），其中有三万斤已经霉烂变质了。这些药材，原是太康县供销社药材批发部的。去年10月，他们把它运到商丘去，要卖给专区中药材批发部，因不合规格，专区批发部没有要。这些药材就被堆放在这里了，任凭风吹、雨淋，无人过问。仓库管理人员通知物主加以管理，太康县药材部派一个人来马马虎虎地翻晒了一部分便回去了。现在，这些香附子继续在霉烂着。
    三万斤香附子，共值四千多元（收购价每斤一角四分），目前市场上又很缺乏这种药材。太康县供销社却看着这些药材被烂掉了。
