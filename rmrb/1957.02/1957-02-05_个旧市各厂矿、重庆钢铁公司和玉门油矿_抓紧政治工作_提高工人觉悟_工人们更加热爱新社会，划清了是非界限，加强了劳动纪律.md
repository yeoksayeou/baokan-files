Gejiu City Factories and Mines, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and Yumen Oil Mine
Intensify Political Work to Enhance Workers' Awareness
Workers increasingly love the new society, distinguish right from wrong, and strengthen labor discipline.

(Our Dispatch) Production factories and mines and basic construction sites in Gejiu City, Yunnan Province, in response to the ideological situations such as some workers' lack of production enthusiasm, lax labor discipline, and some cadres' concern for personal gains and losses, have adopted the method of recalling past suffering and comparing it with the present, and carefully calculating accounts. Through mass summary work, they have conducted socialist ideological education for the broad masses of workers and staff.

The Party committees of Malage Tin Mine and Gejiu Smelter have conducted specific investigations and research on the ideological situation of employees. Many units have held various meetings to mobilize. Through recollections, comparisons, and calculations, the broad masses of workers and staff have further concretely recognized the superiority of the socialist system, the leading role of the Party, and the correct relationship between individual interests and national interests, thereby raising their ideological awareness. The Party Committee of Gushan Ore Dressing Plant specifically helped workers calculate three accounts: First, what achievements did they make in last year's work, and how much wealth did they create for the country? Second, what improvements and increases have there been in material and cultural life compared to the past? Third, what was the political status of the working class before and after liberation? By calculating the first account, workers not only summarized production experience but also saw the fruits of their labor. By calculating the second and third accounts, workers recalled the miserable lives of the past and loved today's society even more. Old worker Wang Shichong said: "In the old society, we miners ate 'old lady soup' and 'glass soup' (boiled water). We could only eat a little meat during the four major festivals of the year. We worked from before dawn until late at night every day, and the money we earned was not enough to buy clothes, and we couldn't even support our own mothers. Now, I have not only brought my mother here, but I have also married a wife. This is all thanks to the benefits of socialism." Many workers at the Gejiu Smelter recalled the days of living in thatched huts, wearing hemp clothes, and eating bean dregs before liberation, and their awareness was also raised by comparing it with their current lives. Zhang Guoguang, an old worker who has worked in the factory for thirty-four years, said: "What kind of life did miners live before liberation? I suffered from severe stomach problems and rheumatic paralysis, and no one cared. After liberation, the Party and the state sent me to sanatoriums twice. My salary is ten times higher than it was in the past at the Tin Affairs Company. My eldest daughter was admitted to middle school, and my eldest son and I joined the Communist Party. For the happiness of my children and grandchildren, I will work here until I can't work anymore." On this basis, the workers of the Gushan Ore Dressing Plant checked the weak links in production, formulated specific conditions to ensure the completion of the national plan, and launched a socialist competition upsurge. When the workers of the mechanical ore selection section saw that the supply of raw ore was not available, they took the initiative to find twelve tons of raw ore nearby for production. Most of the workers who used to be late for work or doze off at work now consciously abide by labor discipline.

(Our Dispatch) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has strengthened political and ideological education for new workers, and the class consciousness of many new workers has been significantly improved after entering the factory.

With the increasing development of production, the number of new workers in the company increased significantly last year. After entering the factory, they generally held noble aspirations to participate in the construction of the motherland, but because they came from various different classes, they brought many non-working-class ideological consciousnesses after entering the factory. Some people despise labor and have personal fame and profit ideas. They are unwilling to do auxiliary work or work that is not technically strong. They complain about wage treatment and labor discipline is lax. Some new workers also have disunity.

In response to the above situation, the company's Party committee and trade union specifically established a new worker political education group, using methods such as report meetings and discussion meetings to promote the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" to new workers, as well as asking old workers and workshop leaders to introduce the company's glorious struggle history and development prospects, and for different objects, they separately invite old workers from peasant and handicraft backgrounds to introduce their ideological changes and growth process when they first entered the factory, in order to help new workers establish the working class's sense of ownership. While strengthening political and ideological education, some workshops also pay attention to understanding and helping solve the specific difficulties in the lives of new workers.

Through various vivid educations, the emotions of the new workers quickly stabilized. Xu Songfa, a stonemason in the refractory material workshop, recalled the suffering of being a worker in the old society, and when he thought of the happy life today, he worked even harder.

(Our Dispatch) The Communist Youth League organization of the Yumen Oil Mine has conducted communist education among the youth of the entire mine since the fourth quarter of last year. To date, more than 24,000 young people have been educated.

Through this education, young people have further distinguished right from wrong and raised their vigilance against bourgeois ideology. Opposition to immoral behavior has also become a strong public opinion in society. Violations of labor discipline and disrespect for masters and other undesirable phenomena have decreased compared to the past.

During the study, some people used to think that being late or leaving early once or twice, leaving their posts without authorization, and taking small advantages of others were trivial matters, but now they realize that these are by no means trivial matters. Some of the fourteen young people in the refinery who frequently violated labor discipline in the past have now become active members in abiding by labor discipline.

Through propaganda and education, young people understand what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, righteousness is gradually rising. Some young people from other places who had previously requested to leave the Yumen Oil Mine now express their determination to build the oil base for a long time. The Third Engineering Team of the Oilfield Construction Company had as many as sixty-six good deeds in more than a month from October 25 to November 28 last year.

    个旧市各厂矿、重庆钢铁公司和玉门油矿
    抓紧政治工作　提高工人觉悟
    工人们更加热爱新社会，划清了是非界限，加强了劳动纪律
    本报讯　云南个旧市各生产厂矿和基本建设工地，针对有些工人生产热情不够饱满，劳动纪律松弛，以及有些干部计较个人得失等思想情况，采取回忆对比和算细账的办法，通过群众性的总结工作，向广大职工进行社会主义思想教育。
    马拉格锡矿、个旧冶炼厂党委都对职工思想情况进行了具体的调查研究。许多单位都召开了各种会议进行动员。广大职工通过回忆对比和算账，进一步具体认识到社会主义制度的优越性，党的领导作用和个人利益与国家利益的正确关系，提高了思想觉悟。古山选矿厂党委具体帮助工人算了三笔账：一是去年的工作有没有成绩，为国家创造了多少财富？二是物质文化生活比过去有那些提高和增长？三是工人阶级解放前后的政治地位如何？通过算第一笔账，职工们不但总结了生产经验，而且看到了自己的劳动成果。通过算第二、第三两笔账，工人们回忆起往日悲惨的生活，都更加热爱今天的社会。老工人王仕崇说：“我们矿工在旧社会吃的是‘老妈妈汤’、‘玻璃汤’（开水），一年只有过四大节才能吃到一点肉，每天从天不亮干到晚，拿的钱还不够穿衣裳，连自己的母亲都养活不起。现在我不但把母亲接来了，自己还讨了老婆。这都是社会主义的好处。”个旧冶炼厂许多工人回忆起解放前蹲茅草房、穿麻布衣裳、吃豆渣的日子，对比现在的生活，也都提高了觉悟。在这个厂工作过三十四年的老工人张国光说：“解放前矿工过的什么生活？我得了严重的胃病、风湿麻木病，没有人管。解放后，党和国家两次送我去疗养。我的工资比在过去锡务公司时提高了十倍。大女儿考上了中学，我和大儿子加入了共产党。我要为子孙的幸福，在这里干到干不动时为止。”在这个基础上，古山选矿厂的职工检查了生产上的薄弱环节，制定了保证完成国家计划的具体条件，掀起了社会主义竞赛的热潮。机选工段的工人看见原矿供应不上，就主动到附近找到十二吨原矿来生产。原来不按时上班或是上班打瞌睡的工人，大都自觉遵守劳动纪律了。
    本报讯　重庆钢铁公司加强对新进厂工人的政治思想教育，很多新工人进厂后，阶级觉悟有了显著的提高。
    随着生产的日益发展，去年公司新工人大量增加。他们进厂后一般都抱着参加祖国建设的高尚愿望，但由于出身于各个不同的阶层，因而进厂后，带来了很多非工人阶级的思想意识。有些人轻视劳动，有个人名利思想，他们不愿干辅助工或技术性不强的工作，闹工资待遇，劳动纪律松弛。也有些新工人之间互相闹不团结。
    公司党委和工会针对以上情况，专门成立了新工人政治教育组，采用报告会、座谈会等方式，向新工人宣传“八大”的精神，以及请老工人和车间领导同志介绍该公司的光荣斗争历史和发展远景，并针对不同的对象，分别请农民及手工业者出身的老工人，介绍他们刚进厂的思想变化和成长过程，以帮助新工人树立工人阶级的主人翁思想。在加强政治思想教育的同时，有些车间还注意了解和帮助解决新工人生活上的具体困难。
    通过各种生动的教育，新工人的情绪很快稳定下来。耐火材料车间石炭窑工人徐松发回忆起旧社会当工人受苦受难的情况，想到了今天的幸福生活，工作更加起劲。
    本报讯　玉门油矿青年团组织去年第四季度开始在全矿青年中进行的共产主义教育，到目前，已有二万四千多名青年受到了教育。
    通过这次教育，青年们进一步划清了是非界限，提高了对资产阶级思想的警惕。反对不道德行为也成为社会的强烈舆论。违犯劳动纪律、不尊敬师傅等不良现象比过去减少了。
    在学习中，有些人过去认为迟到早退一、二次，擅自离开工作岗位、占别人小便宜都是小事，现在都认识到这绝不是小事了。炼油厂过去经常违犯劳动纪律的十四名青年，现在有些人已经成了遵守劳动纪律的积极分子。
    通过宣传教育，青年们懂得了啥对啥不对。因而正气逐步上升。有些过去曾要求离开玉门油矿的外地青年，现在都表示决心长期建设石油基地。油田建设公司第三工程队在去年10月25日到11月28日的一个多月中，即出现了六十六件好人好事。
