Walk On, Trampling the Frozen Earth!
Japan, Ludi Geng

	These extraordinarily cold days,
	Are a continuation of yesterday's night.
	In the depths of darkness we hear:
	The shivering cries of newborn babies in Kitami [Note 1];
	The mournful groans of the pioneers.
	Slavers are active,
	Girls are being sold off.
	Is it only happening here?
	No, on this side, on that side,
	Heart-piercing, gut-stabbing cold winds are blowing.
	But, in such cold winds,
	The banner of the Sunagawa struggle flutters [Note 2],
	The self-sacrificing fury of Okinawa burns [Note 3].
	Hearts and minds throughout the world,
	Transmit to each other,
	The accusing voice of Nagasaki.
	A homeland of peace and freedom,
	A life of happiness without sorrow,
	Who says this is the empty dream of the weak?
	We are the power,
	The ever-expanding,
	The ever-strengthening collective power—
	Even in extraordinarily cold days,
	From today, the sky will brighten.
	1957—
	When the first golden light pierces the horizon,
	Our hope also expands to fill the entire sky.
	Even if breathing turns into white frost,
	Still, this is a beautiful morning.
	Walk on, crunching, trampling the frozen earth!
                January 1, 1957

The Japanese writer Ludi Geng, who participated in the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, was secretly imprisoned for a long time by the U.S. intelligence agencies stationed in Japan after returning to his country, but he remained strong and unyielding. Later, due to the protests of the Japanese people, he regained his freedom, but his health was severely damaged, and he has spent his days in convalescence in recent years. This is his recent work sent to the translator, specially translated here.
            Translated and annotated by Lou Shiyi

    走过去，踏着冻结的土地！
    日本　鹿地亘
    这出奇的寒冷的日子，
    是昨天的夜晚的继续。
    在黑暗的深底我们听见：
    刚出生的北见〔注一〕的婴儿们的战栗的啼声；
    垦荒人们的哀怨的呻吟。
    人口贩子在活动，
    姑娘们给卖走了。
    难道仅仅是这儿的事么？
    不，在这边，在那边，
    都是穿心刺腹的寒风呀。
    可是，在这样的寒风之中，
    飘扬起砂川的战斗的旗子〔注二〕，
    燃烧着冲绳的舍身的怒火〔注三〕。
    全世界的心和心，
    互相传递着，
    长崎的控诉的声音。
    和平与自由的祖国，
    没有忧愁的幸福的生活，
    谁说这是弱者的空想？
    我们就是力量，
    就是一天天扩大的
    一天天加强的集体的力量——
    纵使是奇寒的日子，
    从今天，天就会亮了。
    1957年——
    最初的金光刺破地平线的时候，
    我们的希望也扩大到整个的天空。
    纵使连呵一口气都冻成雪白的严霜，
    可是，这是清丽的早晨呀。
    走过去，嚓嚓地踏着冻结的土地！
                1957年1月1日
