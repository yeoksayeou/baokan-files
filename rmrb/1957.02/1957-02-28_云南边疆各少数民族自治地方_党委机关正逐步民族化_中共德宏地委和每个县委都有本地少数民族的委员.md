Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 27th – Party organs in the border ethnic minority autonomous areas of Yunnan Province are gradually becoming ethnically integrated. In the six counties of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, most of the members and secretaries of the district committees are already local ethnic minority cadres. The Dehong Prefectural Committee and every county committee have members from local ethnic minorities; some county committees even have Dai and Jingpo cadres serving as deputy secretaries. Si Weizhang (Dai nationality), a current member of the Dehong Prefectural Committee, was originally an assistant to a car driver. After joining the workforce in 1950, he initially served as a work team leader in a township, later led a district, then a county, and now participates in the leadership work of the prefecture.

In the twelve "banna" (a Dai administrative division) and two districts' work committees of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, there were only two local ethnic minority members a year ago. Now, eleven people serve as members of the banna or district work committees, and eight serve as secretaries. The Xishuangbanna Border Work Committee also has local Dai members. A'duo, the Hani deputy secretary of the Xiding Banna Work Committee, was an illiterate hired farmhand four years ago. After leading production and studying at the Yunnan Nationalities Institute, he is now fluent in Hani, Dai, and Han languages, and has a preliminary understanding of written Chinese.

About one-third of the members of the three county committees and their subordinate district committees in the Honghe Hani Autonomous Prefecture are local ethnic minorities. Ethnic groups with smaller populations within the autonomous areas, such as the Lahu and Yao in Xishuangbanna, and the Miao in Honghe, also have their own cadres participating in the Party committee work of the county, banna, or district.

After ethnic minority cadres participated in the Party work of various autonomous regions, they further strengthened the ties between the Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the border regions. Because there are ethnic minority county Party secretaries or committee members in each county of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, some of the meetings convened by the county Party committee and the work reports heard from districts and townships are conducted in local ethnic languages. Some county Party committees are also preparing to use local ethnic scripts to issue various instructions and notices.

    云南边疆各少数民族自治地方
    党委机关正逐步民族化
    中共德宏地委和每个县委都有本地少数民族的委员
    新华社昆明27日电　云南省边疆各少数民族自治地方的党委机关正逐步民族化。在德宏傣族景颇族自治州的六县，各区委委员和书记大多数已是本地民族干部；德宏地委和每个县委都有本地少数民族的委员；有的县委还有傣族和景颇族干部担任副书记。现任德宏地委委员的思伟章（傣族），原是汽车司机的助手。他1950年参加工作后，最初在一个乡任工作组长，后来领导一个区，再领导一个县，现在参加了州的领导工作。
    西双版纳傣族自治州的十二个版纳和两个区的工委中，一年前只有两个本地少数民族委员，现在已有十一人担任版纳或区工委委员，八人担任书记。西双版纳边疆工作委员会也有了本地傣族委员。版纳西定工委的哈尼族副书记阿朵，四年前还是个一字不识的雇农，经过领导生产和到云南民族学院学习，现在他已通晓哈尼、傣、汉三种语言，初步学会汉文。
    红河哈尼族自治区的三个县委和所属区委中，约有三分之一的委员是本地少数民族。在自治地方内人数较少的民族，如西双版纳的拉祜族、瑶族、红河的苗族等，也有自己的干部参加县、版纳或区的党委工作。
    少数民族干部参加各自治地方的党委工作后，进一步密切了党和边疆各族人民的联系。德宏傣族景颇族自治州各县由于有了少数民族的县委书记或委员，县委召开的若干会议和听取区、乡工作汇报，都使用当地民族语言，有些县委并准备采用本地民族文字发布各种指示和通知。
