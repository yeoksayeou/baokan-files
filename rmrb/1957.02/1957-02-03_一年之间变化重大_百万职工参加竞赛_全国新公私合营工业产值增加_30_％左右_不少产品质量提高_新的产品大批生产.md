Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd—Xinhua News Agency reporters have learned from relevant departments: In 1956, the total output value of newly established joint state-private industries nationwide increased by about 30% compared to 1955. Production developed relatively rapidly in major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing. According to statistics from these cities, the increase generally reached about 40%. The quality of many products from joint state-private enterprises has also improved, and a large number of new products that could not be produced in the past have been manufactured.

1956 was the first year that private industrial and commercial enterprises nationwide implemented joint state-private ownership across all industries. During this year, major changes took place in all aspects of enterprises. After welcoming the high tide of socialist transformation, workers threw themselves into the high tide of production with unparalleled enthusiasm. As of now, more than 1.6 million workers nationwide have participated in socialist competitions. Workers have continuously broken production quotas, strived to save raw materials, or enthusiastically put forward rationalization proposals in the competitions, thus continuously improving labor productivity. In Shanghai, the average output value per worker in newly established joint factories in the third quarter of last year increased by more than 30% compared to the same period in 1955. In Tianjin, if the labor productivity of newly established joint enterprises is taken as 100 in the first quarter, it increased to 137.5 in the third quarter. In the first nine months of last year, more than 100,500 advanced producers emerged from the workers of newly established joint enterprises nationwide.

Over the past year, various regions have also carried out economic reorganization of newly established joint enterprises based on needs and possibilities, improved enterprise management systems and technical equipment, so that the production potential of joint enterprises has been fully utilized. Many products that could not be produced in the past were successfully manufactured last year. Shanghai's newly established joint industries added 1,300 new products last year. Tianjin's electrical industry, with its previously scattered and backward equipment, could not meet national needs. After production reorganization, the original 224 households were merged into 66 factories, and the use of more than 100 sets of machinery and equipment was adjusted. Last year, 58 new products, such as ultrasonic flaw detectors and hearing aids, were successfully trial-produced. Beijing's four specialized companies, including medical equipment, also added 84 new products last year, such as cameras and X-ray machines.

Newly established joint enterprises in small and medium-sized cities have also played a significant role in supplying the needs of local people and supporting agricultural production over the past year. The tens of thousands of double-wheeled double-furrow plows and waterwheels produced by joint enterprises in Liaoning Province last year not only supplied the rural areas of the province but also supported Henan, Hunan, and other provinces. About half of the agricultural tools supplied to rural areas in Liaoning Province are produced by joint state-private enterprises. In the past, Shaanxi Province relied on outside supplies for safety matches, bed sheets, transformers, drilling rig parts, vertical wind pumps, bran machines, and many other products. Now, the joint enterprises in the province can produce them.

Over the past year, the vast number of private personnel have also actively contributed their technical talents while participating in enterprise work. In the third quarter of last year, more than 360,000 private personnel in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and ten provinces including Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, and Fujian participated in socialist competitions along with the workers, and nearly 50,000 people were awarded the titles of advanced producers and advanced workers. Some have made significant contributions in improving output, quality, and improving designs and varieties, some have new creations and inventions, and some have disclosed years of technical secrets, many of whom have received material rewards from the state or enterprises.

    一年之间变化重大　百万职工参加竞赛
    全国新公私合营工业产值增加30％左右
    不少产品质量提高　新的产品大批生产
    新华社2日讯　新华社记者从有关部门获悉：1956年全国新公私合营工业的总产值约比1955年增加了30％左右。生产发展得较快的是上海、天津、北京等大城市，据这些城市的统计，一般都增长到40％左右。公私合营企业不少产品的质量也有了提高，并且生产了大批过去不能生产的新产品。
    1956年是全国私营工商业实行全行业公私合营的第一年，在这一年里，企业的各方面都发生了重大变化。职工们在迎接了社会主义改造高潮后，就以无比高涨的热情投入了生产高潮。截至目前止，全国参加社会主义竞赛的职工共有一百六十多万人，职工们在竞赛中不断突破生产定额，努力节约原材料或踊跃地提出合理化建议，因此劳动生产率不断提高。上海市去年第三季度新合营工厂平均每个工人的产值就比1955年同期增加了30％多。天津市新合营企业的劳动生产率如以第一季度为一百，第三季度就提高到一百三十七点五。去年的前九个月，全国新合营企业职工中涌现出的先进生产者达到十万零五千多人。
    一年来各地还根据需要和可能，对新合营企业进行了经济改组，改进了企业管理制度和技术设备，使合营企业的生产潜力得到充分发挥，许多过去不能生产的产品，去年都制造成功了。上海市新合营工业去年就增加了一千三百种新产品。天津电气工业原来设备分散落后不能适应国家需要，经过生产改组把原有的二百二十四户合并为六十六个工厂，并调整了一百多台机器设备的使用，去年就试制成功了超音波探伤器、耳聋助听器等五十八种新产品。北京市医疗器械等四个专业公司去年也新增加了照相机、X光机等八十四种新产品。
    中小城市的新合营企业一年来对供应本地人民需要，支援农业生产方面也发挥了很大的作用。辽宁省合营企业去年生产的几万部双轮双铧犁和水车，不仅供应了本省农村，还支援了河南、湖南等省。辽宁省供应农村的农具，有一半左右是公私合营企业生产的；陕西省过去一向倚靠外地供应的安全火柴、床单、变压器、钻机配件以及立式风泵、麸皮机等许多产品，现在本省的合营企业都能生产了。
    广大的私方人员一年来在参加企业工作中，也积极贡献了自己的技术才能。去年第三季度，北京、上海、天津三市和江西、河南、河北、福建等十省和职工一道参加社会主义竞赛的私方人员共三十六万多人，获得先进生产者和先进工作者称号的近五万人。他们有的在提高产量、质量和改进花色品种方面有重大贡献，有的有新创造和发明，有的公开了多年的技术秘密，其中不少人得到国家或企业的物质奖励。
