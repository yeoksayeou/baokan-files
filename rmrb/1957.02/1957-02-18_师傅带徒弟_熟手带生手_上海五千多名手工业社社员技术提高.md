Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 15th: Over 5,000 members of handicraft cooperatives in Shanghai's cotton weaving, hardware, knitting, leather, and other industries have become skilled workers from novices. This is a result of the various handicraft cooperatives adopting methods such as master teaching apprentice, skilled worker guiding novice, and running spare-time training classes to strengthen training since the collectivization of handicrafts in January last year. After the Xinghua Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative became collectivized, it expanded from forty-seven members to more than two hundred and thirty. Several cooperative groups that were merged in originally used foot-operated iron and wood looms. Now, they have all switched to using electric looms for production. Veteran members patiently helped new members learn how to operate the electric looms, enabling each new member to increase from watching one foot-operated iron and wood loom to watching two electric looms. In the past, they could only produce low-grade free cloth; now, they can produce high-grade corduroy. The Seventh Leather Products Production Cooperative adopted the method of master teaching apprentice to improve the skills of new members. Young worker Xi Xiangdi could originally only make ten ticket holders a day, and half of them had to be reworked. Master worker Zhang Qingqi signed a master-apprentice contract with him for three months of comprehensive instruction, which finally enabled him to master the various processes of applying leather edges, cutting leather, hot-pressing edge lines, and sewing threads relatively skillfully. The number of ticket holders he produced daily increased to fifteen, and the rate of acceptable products reached 99.5%. Last summer, the Jiangning Ironware Production Cooperative held a three-month spare-time training class, training more than forty young workers. Half of these young workers originally could not read drawings or calculate materials and could only forge iron. Now, they have all mastered the skills of skilled workers and can guide production.

    师傅带徒弟　熟手带生手
    上海五千多名手工业社社员技术提高
    新华社上海15日电　上海市棉织、五金、针织、皮革等行业的手工业合作社已经有五千多名社员由生手成为熟手。这是由于从去年1月份手工业合作化后，各手工业社采取师傅带徒弟，熟手带生手以及举办业余训练班等方式加强培训的结果。星华棉织生产合作社合作化后由四十七名社员扩大到二百三十多名，合并进来的好几个合作小组原来都是使用脚踏铁木机的，现在全部改用电动织布机生产，老社员耐心帮助新社员学会了操作电动织布机的方法，使每个新社员由看一台织脚踏铁木机提高到看两台电动布机，过去只能生产低级的自由布，现在已能生产高级的灯心绒了。第七皮革制品生产合作社采取师傅带徒弟办法提高新社员的技术。青工奚祥弟，原来每天只能做十只票夹，而且有一半要返修，老师傅张庆祺就与他订立三个月包教包学的师徒合同，终于使他较熟练地掌握了贴边皮、切皮、烫边线、缝线等各工序，每天生产的票夹增加到十五只，正品率达到99.5％。江宁铁器生产合作社去年夏天举办了一期为时三个月的业余训练班，训练了四十多名青工，这些青工中有一半原来不会看图算料，只会打铁，现在他们都掌握了熟练人的技术，会指导生产了。
