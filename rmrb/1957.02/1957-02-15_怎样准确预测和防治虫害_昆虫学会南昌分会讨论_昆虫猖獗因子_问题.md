How to Accurately Predict and Prevent Insect Pests
    Nanchang Branch of the Entomological Society Discusses the Issue of "Insect Outbreak Factors"

    (By our report) The Nanchang Branch of the Chinese Entomological Society held a discussion meeting on "Insect Outbreak Factors" in early February. A total of sixty-nine people attended the discussion, including teaching staff, scientific research personnel, and plant protection technicians from relevant universities and specialized technical schools, scientific research institutions, and agricultural, forestry, and grain administrative departments.

    The discussion of "Insect Outbreak Factors" is aimed at clarifying the causes of large-scale insect outbreaks, so as to accurately predict and effectively prevent the outbreaks of various plant pests. Regarding this issue, many scholars at home and abroad have conducted specialized and in-depth research for decades and have put forward many views, but until now, no view has completely solved this problem.

    The main points of disagreement regarding "Insect Outbreak Factors" are as follows: (1) Insect outbreaks are caused by the comprehensive effect of many factors, without a dominant factor; while some advocate that there is a dominant factor. (2) Those who acknowledge a dominant factor are divided into two groups: some believe that there is only one common dominant factor for general pests; others believe that each insect has its own dominant factor, and it shifts depending on time, location, and conditions. Those who advocate that general pests have only one common dominant factor are further divided into two parts: one part believes that the dominant factor is climate, and the other part believes that it is food (in areas where pests frequently break out) and the coordination of food and climate (in areas where pests intermittently become disasters).

    The dominant outbreak factor issue was the focus of debate at this meeting. Some believed that climate is the dominant factor. Climate has a great impact on the biological world, determining the distribution of plants and also determining the distribution of insects. Generally, some insects cannot survive in cold places, and those that can survive have fewer generations. Taking the rice stem borer as an example, it cannot exist north of 34 degrees north latitude, and from 34 degrees north latitude southward, as the temperature increases, the number of generations of the rice stem borer gradually increases. In Hainan Island, it occurs six to seven generations per year, while in Jiangxi it only occurs four generations, with a small number of five generations. Some also listed the significant impact of temperature and humidity on the development, growth, and reproduction of various insects, and listed the dependence relationship between the degree of insect damage in the same area over the years and climate change, or the relationship between different insect pests in different regions and the disparity in climate, to illustrate the dominant role of climate in insect outbreaks, emphasizing that only by grasping the climate can we correctly predict and forecast insect outbreaks, and only by changing the microclimate can we control the occurrence of insect pests.

    Some opposed taking climate as the common dominant outbreak factor for general pests, and put forward many counter-evidences. Those who advocate that food is the dominant factor for insect outbreaks, some also listed detailed experimental data to prove that different plants, and even different parts of the same plant, at different growth stages, as insect food, have extremely different effects on the development speed, reproduction size, sex ratio, and mortality rate of insects. Therefore, this group of people believes that changing the food conditions of pests in a direction unfavorable to them, such as improving crop cultivation systems and selecting insect-resistant varieties, is of great significance for suppressing insect outbreaks.

    Some fundamentally do not recognize that general pests have only one common dominant outbreak factor. They believe that climate and food may become dominant factors for insect outbreaks under specific conditions, but one cannot regard a factor that plays a dominant role at one time and in one place as playing a dominant role at any time and place. They also cited many facts to prove that the occurrence of insect pests at different times and places has its own main reasons. They believe that the dominant factor should be analyzed specifically according to specific environmental conditions, and one cannot first determine a general dominant factor and forcibly apply it to all insects and all times and spaces. People holding this view accounted for the majority of all discussants.

    During the discussion, all speakers used rich experimental data, practical work experience, and literature to demonstrate their views.

    怎样准确预测和防治虫害
    昆虫学会南昌分会讨论“昆虫猖獗因子”问题
    本报讯　中国昆虫学会南昌分会于2月上旬举行了一次关于“昆虫猖獗因子”的讨论会。参加这次讨论会的有有关高等学校和专业技术学校、科学研究机关，农、林、粮食行政部门的教学人员、科学研究人员和植物保护技术人员，共六十九人。
    讨论“昆虫猖獗因子”问题，是为了弄清昆虫大量发生的原因，以便对各种植物害虫的猖獗能够准确地预测和有力地防治。关于这个问题，几十年来，国内外有很多学者进行了专门深入的研究，提出了许多见解，但直到现在还没有一种见解圆满解决这个问题。
    对于“昆虫猖獗因子”的意见分歧，主要有这样几点：（一）昆虫的猖獗，是由许多因子综合起着作用的，没有主导因子；有的则主张有一个主导因子。（二）承认有主导因子，但有的认为一般害虫只有一个共同的主导因子；有的则认为每一种虫都各有其主导因子，并且因时间、地点、条件而转移。主张一般害虫只有一个共同的主导因子的人，又分为两部分，一部分认为主导因子是气候，另一部分认为是食物（在害虫经常猖獗的地方），及食物与气候的协调（在害虫间歇性成了灾的地方）。
    主导的猖獗因子问题是这次会上争论的焦点。有的认为气候是主导因子。气候对于生物界的影响很大，决定着植物的分布，也决定着昆虫的分布。一般情况是：在寒冷地方有些昆虫不能生存，能够生存的，发生的时代也比较少。以三化螟为例，北纬三十四度以北就不能存在，而从北纬三十四度往南，随着温度的趋高，三化螟发生的世代也逐渐增加。在海南岛每年发生六—七代，而在江西每年只有四代，少数五代。有的还列举了温、湿度对于各种虫的发育、生长、繁殖的重大影响，列举了同一地区历年虫害程度不同和气候变化的依存关系，或不同地区虫害不同和气候悬殊的关系，来说明气候对于害虫猖獗的主导作用，强调只有掌握气候才能正确进行害虫猖獗的预测预报，才能通过改变小气候来控制害虫的发生。
    有的反对把气候作为一般害虫共同的主导猖獗因子，提出许多反证。主张食物是害虫猖獗的主导因子的人，有的还列举了详细的实验资料，证明不同植物，甚至同一植物的不同部位，不同生长时期，作为昆虫食料时，对于昆虫的发育速度、繁殖大小、雌雄性别、死亡率的影响，都有极大差异。因此，这一部分人认为：朝不利于害虫的方向，改变害虫的食物条件，如改善作物栽培制度，选择抗虫品种等，对抑制害虫猖獗有重大意义。
    有的根本不承认一般害虫只有一个共同的主导猖獗因子，他们认为：气候、食物在特定的条件下都可能成为害虫猖獗的主导因子，但不能把一时一地起主导作用的因子，看作在任何时间地点都起主导作用。他们也举出了很多事实，证明在不同时间，不同地点，虫害的发生都各有其主要原因。他们认为：主导因子应该根据具体环境条件具体分析，不能先确定一个一般的主导因子，硬往所有的昆虫、所有的时间空间上套。持这一部分见解的人，占全体讨论者的多数。
    在讨论过程中，所有发言的人在论证自己的观点时，都用了丰富的实验资料、实际工作经验和文献资料。
