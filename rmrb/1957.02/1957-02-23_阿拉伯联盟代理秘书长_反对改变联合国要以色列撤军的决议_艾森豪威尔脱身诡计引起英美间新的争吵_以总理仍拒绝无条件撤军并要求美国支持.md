Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 22nd: According to Cairo Radio, the Arab League's Acting Secretary-General, Raif Barlam, stated on February 21st: "The Arabs will oppose any possible modifications to the UN resolution regarding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Egyptian territory."

Barlam said, "If the United Nations changes its previous decision, it would be siding with Israel, an action that violates its own guarantees."

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: London news: The British Foreign Office issued a statement on February 21st regarding the Israeli withdrawal issue, stating that the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the entry of UN forces into the Gaza Strip and other "disputed areas" should be a "joint action."

The statement pointed out that the British government's views on resolving the issues of the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba, forcibly occupied by Israel, have already been explained in the House of Commons. This is: favoring some form of "internationalization" of the Gaza Strip and recognizing the Strait of Tiran as an international waterway.

A Foreign Office spokesperson, in explaining the British statement, said that its basis is to ensure that the Middle East region "cannot return" to the situation before the Suez War.

The British Foreign Office statement followed closely after Eisenhower's broadcast address on the Israeli withdrawal issue. United Press International believes that the British statement indicates "fundamental differences" between Britain and the United States in their approaches to resolving the Middle East issue.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: London news: British members of Parliament sharply criticized Eisenhower in the House of Commons on February 21st for issuing a broadcast address calling for Israeli withdrawal without consulting Britain. They also demanded a debate on the Middle East issue.

Former Labour Party Defence Secretary Shinwell said, to the cheers of MPs, that even if the government "made mistakes in the Middle East issue, the House of Commons has no reason to forgive any mistakes made by Eisenhower."

Conservative MP Fraser said: "Forcing Israel to retreat without providing appropriate guarantees for Israel's future is unacceptable to most MPs."

Conservative Leader of the House of Commons, Butler, said at the time that he would "definitely consider" the opinions of the MPs. He said: "I will discuss these opinions with the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister himself."

Meanwhile, many British newspapers expressed strong emotions, stating that any attempt by the United States to impose sanctions on Israel would cause a new and serious rupture in Anglo-American relations.

The "Daily Telegraph," which usually reflects the views of the Conservative upper echelons, said furiously: "The central part of the President's (Eisenhower's) argument seems to have been conceived in ignorance, produced by disregard for experience, and nurtured by foolish actions."

The "Daily Mail" complained that British ministers had already been severely disciplined by their American counterparts.

The "Evening Standard" stated that it "agrees with the views of Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and supports Israel's attitude."

Amidst a wave of domestic opposition to American policy, British Prime Minister Macmillan hastily discussed the Israeli withdrawal issue with Foreign Secretary Lloyd on the evening of February 21st.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: Tel Aviv news: Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion reiterated on the evening of February 21st that Israel refuses to implement the UN resolution requiring it to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip.

He also said: "The (Israeli) government has decided to make further efforts to reach an understanding with the United States government."

Ben-Gurion stated that withdrawal was not possible if Israel's demands were "not guaranteed." Israel's demands are: first, its ships must have "free passage" in the Gulf of Aqaba; second, it must "jointly administer" the Gaza Strip with UN forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 22nd: Egyptian Director of Information Hatem issued a statement on February 22nd, accusing Israel of expelling 25,000 Arabs from the Gaza Strip after invading Egypt.

Hatem said that 10,000 of the expelled Arabs had arrived in El Arish in the central Sinai Peninsula, and another 15,000 had arrived in Jordan.

Referring to Israel's demands for specific guarantees regarding the Gaza Strip, Hatem said: Israel is "undermining the principles upon which the United Nations was founded" and is "endangering world peace by insisting on non-compliance with UN resolutions."

    阿拉伯联盟代理秘书长
    反对改变联合国要以色列撤军的决议
    艾森豪威尔脱身诡计引起英美间新的争吵
    以总理仍拒绝无条件撤军并要求美国支持
    新华社开罗22日电　据开罗电台报道，阿拉伯联盟代理秘书长拉伊弗·巴拉马21日说：“阿拉伯人将反对对联合国关于以色列部队从埃及领土撤退的决议进行任何可能的修改。”
    巴拉马说：“如果联合国改变它以前的决定，那就是偏袒以色列，这是违反它自己的保证的行动”。
    新华社22日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部21日就以色列撤军问题发表声明，认为以色列军队的撤退和联合国部队开进加沙地带等“争执中的地区”应当是一个“联合行动”。
    声明指出，英国政府对于解决被以色列强占的埃及领土加沙地带和亚喀巴湾问题的意见，已经在下院说明了。这就是：赞成加沙地带的某种形式的“国际化”和承认蒂朗海峡是一条国际水道。
    外交部发言人在解释英国这项声明的时候说，它的基础是要使中东地区“不能恢复”到苏伊士战争以前的状况。
    英国外交部的这项声明是紧跟着艾森豪威尔就以色列撤军问题所作的广播演说以后发表的。合众社认为，英国的声明表明了英美两国在解决中东问题的方法上存在着“基本分歧”。
    据新华社22日讯　伦敦消息：英国议员21日在下院猛烈抨击艾森豪威尔没有征求英国的意见就发表广播演说要以色列撤军。他们还要求就中东问题举行一次辩论。
    前工党国防大臣辛威尔在议员们的欢呼声中说，即使政府“在中东问题上犯了错误，下议院也没有理由来宽恕艾森豪威尔所犯的任何错误”。
    保守党议员福莱塞说：“强迫以色列后撤而不对以色列的前途提出适当的保证，这是大多数议员所不能接受的”。
    保守党下院领袖巴特勒当时表示“一定考虑”议员们的意见。他说：“我要同外交大臣和首相本人讨论这种意见”。
    同时，英国许多报纸情绪激动，表示美国任何要对以色列加以制裁的企图，将在英美关系上引起新的严重的破裂。
    通常反映保守党上层人物意见的“每日电讯报”怒不可遏地说：“总统（艾森豪威尔）论断的中心部分像是由无知所孕育成的，由对经验的无视所产生的，由愚蠢的行动所抚养的。”
    “每日邮报”抱怨说，英国的大臣们已经受到他们美国对手的严重的惩戒。
    “标准晚报”表示，它“同意以色列总理本—古里安的观点和支持以色列的态度”。
    英国首相麦克米伦21日晚上在国内对于美国政策的一片反对声中匆忙地同外交大臣劳埃德商讨了以色列撤军问题。
    据新华社22日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列总理本—古里安21日晚间再次表示，以色列拒绝执行联合国要它立即无条件撤出亚喀巴湾和加沙地带的决议。
    他同时说：“（以色列）政府决定作进一步的努力来同美国政府取得谅解。
    本—古里安表示，如果以色列提出的要求“没有保证”，就不可能撤军。以色列的要求是：一、它的船只要在亚喀巴湾“自由航行”；二、它要同联合国部队“共同管理”加沙地带。
    据新华社开罗22日电　埃及情报司司长哈特姆22日发表声明，指责以色列在侵略埃及以后把二万五千名阿拉伯人赶出加沙地带。
    哈特姆说，已经有一万名被赶走的阿拉伯人到达西奈半岛中部的阿里希，另外一万五千人到达了约旦。
    哈特姆在谈到以色列要求关于加沙地带的具体保证的时候说：以色列“在破坏联合国赖以建立的原则”，并且“由于坚持不遵守联合国决议而危及世界和平”。
