    The Road to Sino-Japanese Friendship is Broad
		Pei Da
    In a beautiful garden by the sea in Nagasaki, Japan, two Japanese men were engaged in a heated debate about "which road is closest to China." A poet, who had long wanted to visit New China, heard that Nagasaki was the closest to China, so he moved there and lived for half a year. He said he hoped to catch a glimpse of the beautiful scenery of New China across the sea when the weather was clear. A merchant retorted, "Don't believe that; it's just a mirage. I'm being practical. Cargo can be sent from Nagasaki to Shanghai by ship in just one day and night; that's the closest route." The poet countered, "No, the closest route is from Tokyo to Beijing. The road in people's hearts has long been open; now we are just waiting for formal navigation." This happened in August last year. The words of those two Japanese reflect the wishes of the vast majority of Japanese people.

    Although there is no "formal navigation" between China and Japan, the road of friendship between the two peoples is broad. In 1956, sixty Japanese groups, totaling more than 1,200 people, visited China. From January to November, 369 Japanese cargo ships sailed to China, with a total weight of more than 950,000 tons. On the Chinese side, seven delegations, totaling more than 140 people, paid friendly visits to Japan. In that year, the scale of friendly exchanges and trade between the people of China and Japan developed greatly compared with the previous year. Visitors to China came from all walks of life in Japan, and some so-called "embargoed" goods were also transported to China.

    A year has passed, but the friendly feelings between the two peoples remain forever in people's memories. On New Year's Day 1956, representatives of the Japan Electrical Machinery Workers' Union Federation attended a New Year's celebration banquet in Beijing, while Japanese friends, such as the Yokohama City delegation, spent a happy New Year's Eve with the Chinese people amid the sound of firecrackers. The cordial discussions between representatives of the literary and art circles of the two countries in Beijing when hundreds of flowers were blooming; the meeting between two Japanese railway workers and Liu Zhankui, a Chinese axle expert, on the train from Changchun to Siping... The touching scenes are endless. In Beijing cinemas showing Japanese films such as "Street Without Sun" and "Women in the Flames of War," and in the exhibition hall of the "Atomic Bomb Disaster Pictures," many Chinese audiences shed tears of sympathy. And how delighted and inspired Chinese audiences were when they saw the achievements of Japanese science and technology at the Japanese commodity exhibition!

    "Our friendship is noble, beautiful, and loyal," as the song "Tokyo-Beijing" praises, the friendly wishes of the Chinese people touched many Japanese friends. Rokuzaburo Terajima, deputy leader of the Japanese delegation from six major metropolitan areas, prefectures, and cities, said: "What impressed me most about China was that Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Peng Zhen all received us with a very friendly attitude. In particular, Chairman Mao Zedong shook hands with each of us and conveyed his greetings to the Japanese people. I think this is the best gift we brought back." On the way back home, Saburo Endo, former lieutenant general of the Japanese Army and member of the Japanese ex-servicemen's delegation to China, told the Hong Kong press, "The Chinese are very friendly to us. We used to be their enemies, but this time we were welcomed and received with such enthusiasm. This kindness really touched us."

    Many Japanese friends who have visited China have gained a deeper understanding of the situation in China. After returning from his visit to China, the Japanese playwright Mantaro Kubota shook hands with Mozaburo Suzuki, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, and said, "Before I went to China, I hated politics the most. After seeing the happiness of the masses in liberated China, I began to understand how important politics is." Minbu Miyabe, deputy leader of the Japanese Youth and Women's Delegation to China, said that the Chinese working class is working hard to build socialism with magnificent strength, and that young people, students, workers, and people of all ages and genders are working hard to learn. "We were deeply moved by the sight of a girl operating an elevator in a hotel seizing the time to study. I sincerely wish the great Chinese people progress." After visiting China, a pastor from Tokyo's Hongo Church said, "Even the Bibles published in Japan have to go through the hands of Americans, while Chinese Christians publish their own Bibles." After returning to his country, he often introduced the situation in China and the importance of Sino-Japanese friendship to his congregation on the altar on Sundays.

    In Japan, the graceful singing and dancing of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe brought infinite joy to the Japanese people. Friendly visits by Chinese peace representatives, scholars, and trade union workers were welcomed by all sectors of Japanese society. Everywhere they went, the song "Tokyo-Beijing" was heard. After shaking hands with a Chinese trade union representative, a Japanese worker was so happy that he shook hands with every friend he met, saying, "This hand has been shaken by a Chinese brother," meaning that he wanted to convey the friendship of Chinese workers to more Japanese people. Whenever Chinese representatives bid farewell to Japan, Japanese friends were always reluctant to part, and some even shed tears. They shouted loudly, "You must come again!"

    The Japanese people's interest in China is becoming increasingly broad. Last year, Japan translated dozens of Chinese social science books and modern literary works, publishing a total of about 300,000 copies; more than 25 kinds of books introducing the situation in China were issued more than 70,000 copies; and more than 130 papers introducing China were published in various comprehensive magazines and academic magazines. In addition, more than ten kinds of Chinese language learning books were published.

    In order to meet the needs of the masses, the Japan-China Friendship Association showed Chinese films more than 200 times in more than 50 cities last year. Films such as "Today's China," "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," and "Steel Warrior" were welcomed by 100,000 audiences. Students from the Yanagawa School for the Blind in Fukuoka Prefecture performed "Zhu Yingtai" at the Fukuoka Prefecture High School "Drama Competition" and won an excellent award. Twenty third-grade female students from Kawanishi Elementary School in Hyogo Prefecture performed Chinese waist drums at the "School Arts Fair," winning enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    Ordinary Japanese workers and peasants are very concerned about the lives and production of Chinese workers and peasants. Wang Huijun, a telephone operator at the Beijing Long-Distance Telephone Bureau, wrote a life communication to the newspaper of the Japan Electrical Communication Workers' Union last year, which was welcomed by tens of thousands of telephone operators in Japan. Farmers in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, saw the introduction of the excellent wheat variety "Bima No. 1" in a Chinese pictorial and wrote to the Northwest Agricultural College in Shaanxi Province for seeds, and the trial planting results were very good. People said, "The friendly seedlings have grown up." Enthusiastic Japanese young people and students like to write letters to Chinese young people and students, and the number of pen pals between the two countries is increasing.

    The Japanese people's movement to demand the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan is constantly developing. From February 15 to March 15 last year, 450,000 people signed petitions to the Japanese government. At the same time, 50 prefectural and city councils across Japan submitted requests to the government to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan. Last year, the Japan-China Friendship Association added five prefectural federations and sixteen city, town, and village branches. Many prefectural, city, government, and council leaders served as chairmen, taking the lead in carrying out Japan-China friendship activities.

    After Japan restored normal relations with the Soviet Union, the Japanese people's call for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China became even louder. In the new year, with the joint efforts of the people of China and Japan, friendly exchanges between the two peoples will surely become more frequent, and the friendship between the two peoples will inevitably increase, which no force can stop.

    中日友好之路是广阔的	裴达
    在日本长崎市临海的一个美丽的花园里，有两个日本人对于“哪条道路离中国最近”的问题进行了热烈的辩论。一个很早就想到新中国来观光的诗人，听说长崎离中国最近，就搬到那里住了半年。他说，他希望在天气晴朗的时候，隔着海望一望新中国的美丽景色。另一个商人说：“不要相信，那是海市蜃楼。我是讲实际的，货从长崎送上船去，一个昼夜就可以到上海，那是最近的路。”诗人反驳道：“不，最近的路是从东京到北京。人们心上的道路是早就通了的，现在就等待正式通航了。”这是去年8月里发生的事情。那两个日本人的话，反映出了日本广大人民的愿望。
    中日两国之间虽然没有“正式通航”，但是两国人民之间的友谊之路却是广阔的。1956年，日本有六十个团体、一千二百多人访问了中国。从1月到11月，日本有三百六十九艘货船开到中国，总重量为九十五万多吨。中国方面也有七个代表团、一百四十多人到日本进行了友好访问。这一年，中日两国人民的友好往来和贸易交流的规模，都比前一年有了很大的发展。来中国访问的人普及到日本各个阶层，一部分所谓“禁运”物资也运到了中国。
    一年过去了，可是两国人民的友好情节却永远留在人们的记忆之中。1956年元旦，日本电机机器工会联合会的代表在北京参加了庆祝新年的宴会，而横滨市代表等日本友人，则和中国人民一起在鞭炮声中度过了欢乐的除夕之夜。在北京百花飘香的时刻，两国文学艺术界代表的恳谈；在从长春开往四平的列车机车上，日本两位铁路工人和中国超轴能手刘占魁的会见……动人的情景真是说不完。在放映“没有太阳的街”、“战火中的妇女”等日本影片的北京电影院里，在“原子弹灾害图”的展览室中，多少中国观众洒下了同情的眼泪。而在日本商品展览会上，当中国观众看到日本科学技术成就的时候，又是多末欢欣鼓舞啊！
    “我们的友谊高贵、美丽、忠诚”，正像“东京——北京”这首歌曲所歌颂的那样，中国人民的友好心愿感动了许多日本友人。日本六大都、府、县、市访华代表团副团长寺岛录三郎说：“对中国印像最深的，是毛泽东、周恩来、彭真都以非常友好的态度热情地接待我们。特别是毛泽东主席和我们每一个人都握手，向日本国民问好，我认为这是我们带回去的最好的礼物。”日本前军人访华代表团回国途中，前陆军中将远藤三郎对香港报界说：“中国人对我们非常友好。过去我们曾经是他们的敌人，可是这次前去访问却受到了那样热情的欢迎和接待，这种盛意确实使我们感动。”
    许多访问过中国的日本友人，对中国情况有了进一步的了解。日本剧作家久保田万太郎老先生访华归国后，握着日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎的手说：“我去中国以前最厌恶政治，看了解放了的中国大众的幸福情形，我开始懂得政治是何等的重要。”日本青年与妇女访华代表团副团长宫部民夫说，中国工人阶级正以雄壮的力量为建设社会主义而努力，青年、学生、工人，各阶层男女老少都在努力学习，“我们看到旅馆中一个开电梯的姑娘抓紧时间学习的情况，深为感动，我衷心祝福伟大的中国人民前进”。东京本乡教会的一个牧师访问中国后说：“在日本出版的圣经也要经过美国人的手，而中国基督教徒是自己出版圣经的。”他回国后，经常在礼拜日的教坛上，向教徒介绍中国的情况和日中友好的重要意义。
    在日本，中国京剧代表团的轻歌妙舞，给日本人民带去了无限的喜悦。中国和平代表、学者和工会工作者的友好访问，都受到日本各界的欢迎。他们所到之处，都响起了“东京——北京”的歌声。一位日本工人和中国工会代表握过手之后，他高兴得见着朋友就握手，说：“这只手是和中国兄弟握过的”，意思是说要把中国工人兄弟的友情传达给更多的日本人民。每当中国代表离别日本的时候，日本友人总是依依不舍，有的甚至流下泪来。他们高声地呼喊：“你们一定要再来啊！”
    日本人民对中国的兴趣越来越广泛。去年日本翻译中国的社会科学书籍和现代文学作品等数十种，共约出版三十万册；二十五种介绍中国情况的书，发行了七万册以上；各综合杂志、学术杂志发表了一百三十多篇介绍中国的论文。此外，还出版了十多种中国语文学习的书籍。
    日中友好协会为满足人民大众的要求，去年在五十多个城市放演中国电影二百次以上，“今日中国”、“梁山伯与祝英台”、“钢铁战士”等影片，受到了十万观众的欢迎。福冈县柳河盲人学校的学生，在福冈县高等学校“演剧比赛会”上演出了“祝英台”，获得了优秀奖。兵库县川西小学二十名三年级的女学生，在“学艺会”上表演了中国腰鼓，博得观众的热烈喝采。
    日本普通工人、农民对中国工人、农民生活和生产情况十分关切。北京市长途电话局的话务员王辉君，去年曾给日本电气通信工会的报纸写了一篇生活通讯，受到日本数万电话交换手的欢迎。日本长野县的农民从中国画报上看到“碧蚂一号”小麦优良品种的介绍，就给陕西省西北农学院写信要去了种籽，试种成绩很好。人们说：“友好的苗儿生长起来了”。热情的日本青年、学生很喜欢给中国青年、学生写信，两国青年之间的笔友越来越多了。
    日本人民要求恢复中日邦交的运动正在不断发展。去年2月15日至3月15日，在给日本政府的请愿书上签名的就有四十五万人。与此同时，日本全国有五十个县、市议会向政府提出了恢复中日邦交的要求。去年，日中友好协会增设了五个县联合会，十六个市、町、村支部。许多县、市政府和议会的首脑人物担任了会长，带头开展日中友好活动。
    日本同苏联恢复正常关系之后，日本人民要求恢复日中两国邦交的呼声更高了。在新的一年中，在中日两国人民的共同努力下，两国人民之间的友好往来一定会更加频繁，两国人民之间的友谊必然是有增无减，这是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
