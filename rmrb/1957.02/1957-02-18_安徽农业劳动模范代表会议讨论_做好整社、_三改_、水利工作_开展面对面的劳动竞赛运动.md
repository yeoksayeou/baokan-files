Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, February 17th: "By every possible means, strive for a great agricultural harvest this year!" This is the central topic discussed at the Anhui Province's recent meeting of agricultural labor model representatives.

The more than 1,200 labor model representatives attending the meeting believed in their discussions that if a great harvest is to be achieved this year, the work of rectifying agricultural cooperatives must first be effectively carried out. All labor model representatives stated in their speeches that, after severe testing over the past year, Anhui Province's agricultural cooperatives are basically consolidated and have accumulated rich production experience. Although agricultural cooperatives have some problems, as long as they are rectified, they will be more consolidated and will greatly encourage the production enthusiasm of the members, which is the basic driving force for promoting this year's production to a high tide. Currently, the work of rectifying cooperatives has been universally launched throughout the province. More than 20,000 cadres have been transferred to rural areas to help rectify cooperatives and lead production. Local areas have also trained more than 45,000 key personnel for rectifying cooperatives, thus accelerating the progress of the rectification work.

Secondly, the three agricultural production reforms must continue to be promoted. The agricultural production reforms in Anhui Province, after several years, especially the large-scale promotion last year, have achieved great results and accumulated a lot of experience. Labor models used countless vivid facts to illustrate the significant role of agricultural production reform in increasing production and avoiding disasters. This year, Anhui Province plans to increase the total area of production reform to 57.7 million mu, and the multiple cropping index will increase to 180%. Three-season continuous cropping is planned for around 12.2 million mu, and the planting area of high-yield crops should reach 47.6% of the total area of food crops. Labor models have expressed their willingness to lead farmers to complete this plan.

To achieve a great harvest, labor models also believe that water conservancy work must be vigorously carried out. This year, Anhui Province plans to vigorously carry out waterlogging control projects in Huaibei and along the Yangtze River; build 600 small reservoirs in hilly areas, and renovate 550,000 ponds, dams, and other projects to expand the irrigation area; water and soil conservation work will be carried out in mountainous areas, combined with flood control projects; and river embankments will continue to be reinforced. In addition to the Yangtze River embankment renovation project, the province plans to construct a total of over 400 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects. Now, the spring repair of water conservancy projects throughout the province is about to start in full swing, and labor models have expressed their willingness to take the lead in water conservancy work.

The meeting believes that the spring plowing season is approaching. We must act immediately, and throughout the province, we must launch a short-distance, face-to-face socialist labor emulation campaign between cooperatives, between teams, between farms, and between machine耕 stations, and set off a vigorous large-scale production movement.

    安徽农业劳动模范代表会议讨论
    做好整社、“三改”、水利工作
    开展面对面的劳动竞赛运动
    新华社合肥17日电　“千方百计，争取今年农业大丰收！”这是安徽省最近举行的农业劳动模范代表会议讨论的中心课题。
    出席会议的一千二百多位劳动模范代表在讨论中认为，今年要想取得大丰收，首先必须切实做好整顿农业社的工作。所有劳动模范代表在发言中都认为，一年来，安徽省的农业社经过严重的考验以后，基本上是巩固的，并且积累了丰富的生产经验。农业社虽然存在一些问题，但是只要进行整顿，就会更加巩固，并将大大鼓舞社员的生产热情，这是推动今年生产走向高潮的基本动力。现在，整社工作在全省已经普遍展开了。全省各地抽调下乡帮助整社和领导生产的干部已有二万多人。各地还训练了四万五千多名整社骨干，因此加快了整社工作的进展。
    其次，必须继续推行农业生产三项改革。安徽省的农业生产改革经过几年来、特别是去年一年大面积的推行，取得的成绩是很大的，经验是很多的。劳动模范们用无数生动的事实说明农业生产改革对增产避灾的重大作用。今年，安徽省计划生产改革的总面积将要增加到五千七百七十万亩，复种指数增加到180％。计划三季连作在一千二百二十万亩左右，高产作物的种植面积，要达到粮食作物总面积的47.6％。劳动模范们都表示要带动农民完成这个计划。
    要想取得大丰收，劳动模范们还认为，必须大力做好水利工作。今年，安徽省计划在淮北和长江沿岸大力开展治涝工程；在丘陵地区修建小水库六百座，整修塘坝等工程五十五万处，以便扩大灌溉面积；在山区将开展水土保持工作，结合作好防洪工程；江河堤防将继续加固。除长江整堤工程外，全省计划兴修水利工程土方共四亿多公方。现在全省水利春修工程即将全面动工，劳动模范们都表示要在水利工作中起带头作用。
    会议认为，春耕季节即将到来。必须立即行动起来，在全省范围内，要开展一个短距离的、面对面的、社与社、队与队、农场与农场、机耕站与机耕站之间的社会主义劳动竞赛，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的大生产运动。
