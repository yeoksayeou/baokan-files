Xinhua News Agency, February 10th -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Shen Ding reports that the Northern Kunqu Opera Troupe held its first performance at the Beijing Theater tonight. The theater exceptionally sold seats behind the pillars where the stage was virtually invisible to several audience members, because they repeatedly insisted that even listening to the singing would be a great pleasure.

Hou Yongkui, a famous martial artist known as the "Living Lin Chong," performed his signature piece, "Lin Chong Flees at Night." He portrayed Lin Chong wearing a hero's hat, a sword costume, and fast boots, stepping onto the stage quickly. As soon as he appeared, his eyebrows showed the grief and indignation of a hero who had been persecuted and had fallen to the ends of the earth; he then looked back while holding his sword, and in that instant, he showed Lin Chong's frantic escape. In his short twenty-five-minute performance, he moved the audience with his tragic and indignant singing and complex and beautiful gestures, inspiring them with infinite sympathy for the hero's fate and gratitude to the playwright Li Kaixian (of the Ming Dynasty) for leaving such a precious legacy to later generations.

Twenty-three years ago, Hou Yongkui was just a small martial artist in a rural opera troupe. He performed "Lin Chong Flees at Night" on his first day in Beijing, and he became famous throughout Beijing the next day. This play was also the first repertoire he performed on stage at the age of fifteen. After being tempered and polished thousands of times over the past thirty years, it is truly extraordinary.

Northern Kunqu opera performing artists Han Shichang and Bai Yunsheng performed "A Stroll in the Garden, Startled by a Dream," a segment from the Ming Dynasty playwright Tang Xianzu's famous work, "The Peony Pavilion." Han Shichang played the female lead, Du Liniang, and Bai Yunsheng played the scholar Liu Mengmei. When they performed the scene where the male and female leads meet in a dream, their steps were light and their water sleeves fluttered. These two performing artists actually created a dreamy atmosphere with their movements.

It is hard to believe that the performer of the beautiful and delicate girl on stage is an old man in his sixties; and that the suave and handsome young scholar is already fifty-six years old. The charm of art has rejuvenated them.

The sixty-four-year-old artist Hou Yushan starred in "Zhong Kui Marries Off His Sister." Hou Yushan, playing Zhong Kui, spewed out countless sparks as soon as he opened his mouth on stage, and people couldn't help but applaud this technique of creating a mythical atmosphere. Zhong Kui's sister was played by Li Fengyun, the only female actor among the senior Kunqu opera artists in the North. The five actors playing the ghost soldiers each had their own set of acrobatic stunts. Four of the young actors were all members of the children's troupe that Hou Yushan cultivated when he was farming in his hometown before liberation.

"Zhaojun Departs for the Frontier" is one of the signature pieces of the famous actor Ma Xianglin. Tonight, this play was starred in by his proud student, the young actress Li Shujun. She successfully performed the painful feelings of the peerless beauty Wang Zhaojun on her way to marry the barbarian chieftain. She was originally an actress at the Central Experimental Opera House and had been studying Kunqu opera for less than three months, but she was already as skilled as an old actor. Her performance also received enthusiastic applause from the audience.

### 北方昆剧在京首次公演  艺术的魅力让老演员们青春再现

    北方昆剧在京首次公演
    艺术的魅力让老演员们青春再现
    新华社10日讯　新华社记者沈鼎报道，今晚，北方昆曲代表团在北京剧场举行首次公演。剧场破例把场内柱子后面根本看不到舞台的座位卖给了几位观众，因为他们再三要求说，即使看不到，听唱也是莫大的享受。
    被人称做“活林冲”的著名武生侯永奎演出了他的拿手好戏“林冲夜奔”。他所扮演的林冲头戴英雄帽，身着剑衣，足蹬快靴，急步出台。刚一亮相，在眉宇之间就表现了横遭迫害、沦落天涯的英雄在当时的悲愤心情；他紧接着按剑回顾，在这一瞬间就表现了林冲正在仓惶逃走的神态。他在短短二十五分钟的表演里，以悲壮激愤的歌声、繁复美妙的身段打动了观众的心弦，让人们对这位英雄的命运寄以无限同情，并且感谢剧作者李开先（明代人）留给后人如此珍贵的遗产。
    二十三年前，侯永奎还是一个乡下戏班子里的小武生，他到北京第一天演出“林冲夜奔”，第二天就名满北京。这出戏也是他在十五岁时第一次登台演出的剧目，三十年来演出不下上千次，经过了千锤百炼，毕竟不同凡响。
    北方昆剧表演艺术家韩世昌和白云生演出了“游园惊梦”——明代剧作家汤显祖的名作“牡丹亭”中的一段。韩世昌扮演女主角杜丽娘，白云生扮演书生柳梦梅。当他们演到男女主角在梦境中相会时，脚步轻盈、水袖飘忽，这两位表演艺术家，竟然以自己的动作制造了梦境迷离的气氛。
    人们难以相信，舞台上那位美丽娇弱的少女的表演者是个花甲之年的老人；而那位风流倜傥的少年书生也已经有五十六岁了，艺术的魅力，让他们的青春再现。
    六十四岁的老艺人侯玉山主演“锺馗嫁妹”。侯玉山扮演的锺馗上台一张口喷出无数火星，人们不由得不为这一制造神话气氛的手法叫绝。扮演锺馗妹妹的是北方前辈昆曲艺人中唯一的女演员李凤云，扮演鬼卒的五个演员各有一套翻跟斗的绝技，其中四位青年演员都是侯玉山解放前在家乡务农时培养的子弟班演员。
      “昭君出塞”是名演员马祥麟的拿手戏之一。今晚这出戏由他的得意门生、青年女演员李淑君主演。她成功地表演了绝代佳人王昭君出塞和番时一路上的痛苦心情。她原是中央实验歌剧院的演员，学演昆剧还不到三个月，可是已经像老演员一样地熟练。她的表演，同样得到了观众们热烈的采声。
