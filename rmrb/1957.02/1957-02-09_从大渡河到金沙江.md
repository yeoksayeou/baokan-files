　　　　Red Flag in the Deep Mountains
　　The story of General Liu Bocheng and Guo Jiyue Dan, one of the Yi ethnic leaders, swearing an oath of allegiance by drinking blood at the lakeside, has been mythically recorded in the history of the Long March of the Red Army. On November 14th, we passed through the area where they made their oath. Along the way, in the golden oak and white poplar forest areas, and on the snow-covered, sun-lit hills, I seemed to see the marching image of the Red Army during the Long March.

　　As soon as we climbed Mount Pusa and entered the Tuowu Yi ethnic area in Mianning County, we felt like we had returned to our hometown, and we felt close to every plant and tree here. What excited me the most was that I met Mr. Guo Ji Ni Pei, the younger brother of Guo Ji Yue Dan, who personally participated in the oath-taking ceremony at that time.

　　This 51-year-old Yi friend, with a tall and sturdy build, draped in a "Cha'erfan," and wearing a black turban, has a purplish-red square face with bright eyes that always seem to be watching something, immediately leaving a strong and heroic impression. Recalling the scene of the oath-taking ceremony at that time, and the subsequent struggle of the Yi people against the Kuomintang, he spoke passionately: "I personally slaughtered the chicken when I drank blood wine with Brother Liu Bocheng. On this afternoon (May 22, 1935, the ninth day of the fourth lunar month), the Red Army came to the area of our Guo Ji clan. The Red Army propagandists said to us: 'The Red Army and the Yi people are brothers, we must unite to oppose the common enemy and overthrow the Kuomintang warlords.' In addition, the Red Army had good discipline and respected the customs of the Yi people. When they ate buckwheat and potatoes, they always left silver coins on the edge of the field. Therefore, we quickly believed in the Red Army. My brother, Xiao Yue Dan, through the introduction of a Comrade Feng, met with Commander Liu Bocheng and requested to become sworn brothers with Commander Liu. Later, we came to the lakeside, which is five miles in radius, and on the meadow on the west side of the lake, according to the most solemn ceremony of our Yi people, I killed the chicken, and dripped the blood into two bowls of clear water. Then, Sha Ma Er Ge chanted a spell saying:
　　'Today, Commander Liu and Xiao Yue Dan swear an oath of allegiance as brothers by the lake. If anyone changes his mind in the future, he will die like a chicken.' My brother first invited Commander Liu to drink, and he immediately picked up the bowl and said loudly: 'I, Liu Bocheng, and Xiao Yue Dan today swear an oath of allegiance as brothers by the lake. If I go back on my word, may heaven and earth punish me!' My brother laughed and said, 'I, Xiao Yue Dan, today become brothers with Commander Liu, sharing life and death. If I do not keep my oath, may I die like a chicken.' The two raised their bowls and drank it all. Commander Liu also issued us a letter of appointment and a red flag at that time. The red flag read: 'Chinese Yi People's Red Army Guji Detachment'. In addition, he gave Xiao Yue Dan the best Type 38 rifle as a gift. From then on, our Yi people everywhere welcomed the Red Army with flags, allowing the Red Army to safely pass through the Yi ethnic mountain areas. When I led the way for the Red Army, before we parted, the Red Army gave us thirteen guns, two horses, a pig, and several sets of clothes!"

　　After the Red Army left, the Kuomintang bandit army, led by Luo Xiuting, launched a brutal attack on the Red Army's Guji Detachment, but each time it was repelled by the heroic Yi people. In the repeated offensives and defenses, Xiao Yue Dan always held up this red flag, fighting tenaciously for three years. Later, the Kuomintang changed its strategy and used the method of "controlling the Yi people with Yi people," provoking feuds from within the Yi ethnic group. On May 15, 1938, Xiao Yue Dan, 49, finally sacrificed in an ambush plot. In the folk songs mourning Xiao Yue Dan, the Yi people expressed their will and confidence in this way: "Xiao Yue Dan, everyone likes you. Now that you are dead, we must avenge you! If we don't avenge you, we will be sorry to you and to General Liu! Liu Bocheng's Red Army will return!"

　　In those tragic years, the Yi people consistently held hope for the Red Army and for victory. Later, the People's Army did return. When they passed through here again, Xiao Yue Dan's wife and son, Guo Ji Abi Mu, held the red flag of the "Chinese Yi People's Red Army Guji Detachment," which they had preserved with their blood, and walked through the high mountains and old forests, searching everywhere for "Uncle Liu Bocheng" in the advancing ranks, to present the glorious flag to their relatives. The precious Type 38 rifle that Xiao Yue Dan left to his son was donated to the government by his son after liberation.

　　In recent years, more than 14,000 Yi compatriots living in the Tuowu area, under the glorious light of the Party's ethnic policy, have implemented ethnic regional autonomy, restored and developed agricultural production, and developed primitive forest areas. Last year, they also implemented democratic reforms, overthrew the primitive slave system, liberated hundreds and thousands of slaves, and began to leap forward towards a happy socialist society. Talking about these changes, Guo Ji Ni Pei, the current standing committee member of the county political consultative conference, patted his chest and said:

　　"Our Yi ethnic Guo Ji family has always been a friend of the Communist Party. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have the confidence to build socialism in the deep mountains. Please tell Marshal Liu Bocheng that we are loyal to our oath to him. The nine members of Xiao Yue Dan's family are all living well. After the reform, his family still has three cattle, four mules and horses, and more than a hundred sheep!"
　　　　　　
　　　　Golden Valley

　　After crossing the rugged mountain roads and passing Mianning, the jeep sped up along the vast Anning River Valley towards Xichang. On the flat road, there were tall white poplars for dozens of miles. The place once described by Zhuge Liang as barren and desolate has now become so fertile, rich, and beautiful!

　　Xichang, an ancient city known as Qiongdu in the Han Dynasty, Xining Prefecture in the Tang Dynasty, and Jianchang Road in the Yuan Dynasty, is now the capital of Xichang Prefecture, which has a population of more than 1.4 million people of various ethnic groups. The climate here is mild, known as "no cold or heat in all seasons," and various products are very abundant, producing rice, wheat, rapeseed, miscellaneous grains, and other crops. In the subtropical valley of the Jinsha River in the south, pomegranates, coffee, kapok, and banana fruits are all available. The wax insects here are of excellent quality. Every time the wax insects mature in March and April, there is a bustling scene everywhere with "Sichuanese insect merchants rushing around, crossing rocks and ridges like ants." The beautiful Lushan Mountain and Qionghai Lake, which is sixty miles around, outside Xichang City, are even more fascinating places for tourists. The surface of the water is as calm as a mirror, and a gust of wind blows, creating scales of waves, like thousands of white geese swimming.

　　The mountains in the Xichang area are rich in mineral resources, including dozens of types such as iron, coal, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, gold, and mercury. According to historical records, as early as more than 300 years ago, our ancestors had already begun to mine minerals here. According to legend, the Muli Wali gold mine, founded by Tang Tianshan in the Ming Dynasty, once had more than 30,000 gold miners during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, and some gold nuggets weighed as much as 31 catties. Unfortunately, these mining areas were later abandoned and destroyed. After liberation, in the march of the motherland's industrialization, an exploration army of 5,000 people came to this area, and white tents and tall drilling rigs were set up on the surrounding hills. The Yanbian iron mine, which has been identified in the Yalong River basin, has now been proven once again to be one of the largest iron mines in our country. In the ore body, which is more than ten kilometers long, there are outcroppings of shiny ore everywhere. The iron reserves exceed the 280 million tons announced by the state, and the iron content of the ore is also very high, enough to establish a huge steel base in the southwest of our country. Near this iron mine, a large coal field with good quality and suitable for coking has recently been discovered!

　　A comrade who recently returned from the mining area described the future development prospects of this area to me, excitedly saying: On the Chuan-Dian West Road, which stretches for more than 200 kilometers from Xichang to the Jinsha River, vehicles loaded with various exploration personnel and equipment are running day and night. The Chengdu-Kunming Railway, which runs for about 1,050 kilometers through Emei, Xichang, and Huili, is also being surveyed. It is believable that in the near future, this golden valley will radiate a more brilliant light for the motherland!

    从大渡河到金沙江	本报记者　纪希晨
              （续昨）
      深山里的红旗
    刘伯承将军和彝族首领之一果基约旦，在海子边“歃血结盟”的故事，神话似地被载入红军长征的史册里。11月14日这一天，我们经过他们当年结盟的地区。沿路在那金黄的青杠和冬白杨的林区里，在那蒙着白雪、映照着朝阳的山岗上，我仿佛看到了红军长征的跋涉形象。
    一爬上菩萨岗，进入冕宁县拖乌彝族地区，我们就像回到了故乡那样，对这里的一草一木都感到亲切。而最使我兴奋的是我见到了当时亲自参加结盟的果基约旦的弟弟——果基尼培先生。
    这位五十一岁的彝族朋友，体格魁伟，肩披“查尔凡”，头缠黑纱巾，紫红的方脸庞上，炯炯有神的眼睛，总像在注视着什么似的，一见就给人留下健壮慓悍的印象。回忆到当时结盟的情景，和后来彝族反抗国民党的斗争，他便热情奔放地说了下去：“和刘伯承哥哥饮血酒，是我亲自杀的鸡。这天下午（1935年5月22日，农历四月初九日）红军来到我们果基家支的地区里。红军宣传员向我们说：‘红军和彝族是兄弟，我们要联合起来，反对共同的敌人，打倒国民党军阀。’加以红军纪律很好，尊重彝族的风俗，吃了荞子、洋芋都把白洋放在地头里，因之，我们很快相信了红军。我的哥哥小约旦，经过一位冯同志的介绍，会见了刘伯承司令员，要求和刘司令员结拜为兄弟。后来，我们就来到方圆五里大的海子边，在海子西边的草滩上，按我们彝族最隆重的仪式，由我杀了鸡，将血淋在二碗清水里，然后由沙马尔格念咒语说：
  ‘今天刘司令员、小约旦在海子边结盟为兄弟，日后谁如有变心，就同鸡一样死去。’我哥哥先请刘司令员喝，他马上端起碗，大声说：‘我刘伯承同小约旦今天在海子边结义兄弟，如有反复，天诛地灭！’我哥哥一面大笑说好，一面说：‘我小约旦今天同刘司令员结为兄弟，共同生死，如不守誓，同鸡一样死去。’两人端碗一饮而尽。刘司令员当时还给我们颁发了委任状和红旗，红旗上写着：‘中国彝民红军沽鸡支队’，另外，又把一支最好的三八式步枪送给小约旦，作为赠礼。从此，我们彝民到处都打着旗子欢迎红军，使红军安全通过了彝族山区。我在给红军带路时，临别红军还送给我们十三枝枪、二匹马、一只猪和好几套衣服呢！”
    红军走后，以罗秀挺为首的国民党匪军，向红军沽鸡支队展开了残酷的进攻，但每一次都被英勇的彝民打退了回去，在反复的进攻退守中，小约旦始终高擎着这面红旗，一直顽强不屈地战斗了三年。后来，国民党改用“以彝制彝”的办法，从彝族内部挑拨起冤家械斗。1938年5月15日，四十九岁的小约旦，终于牺牲在埋伏袭击的阴谋里。在哀悼小约旦的民歌里，彝胞们这样表达着自己的意志和信心：“小约旦，所有人都喜欢你，现在你死了，我们一定要替你报仇！不报仇，对不起你，也对不起刘将军！刘伯承的红军是会回来的！”
    在那悲惨的年月里，彝族人民始终如一地对红军，对胜利怀抱着希望。后来，人民军队果然回来了。当他们再次经过这里的时候，小约旦的妻子和儿子果基阿比姆，手中捧着他们用鲜血保存下来的“中国彝民红军沽鸡支队”的红旗，穿过高山老林，在进军的行列中，到处寻找着“刘伯承伯伯”，把光辉的旗子交献给自己的亲人。那枝珍贵的三八式步枪，小约旦遗留给他的儿子，他儿子在解放后又把它献给政府了。
    几年来，生活在拖乌地区的一万四千多彝族同胞，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，实行了民族区域自治，恢复发展了农业生产，开发了原始的林区；去年，又实行了民主改革，推翻了原始的奴隶制度，解放了成百成千的奴隶，开始向幸福的社会主义跃进。谈到这些变化，现任县政协常务委员的果基尼培，拍着他的胸膛说：
    “我们彝族果基家，一向是共产党的友人，在毛主席的领导下，我们有信心在深山里建设社会主义。请转告刘伯承元帅吧，我们是忠于对他的誓言的。小约旦家中的九口人，生活都很好，经过改革，他家现在还留有三条牛、四匹骡马和一百多只羊哩！”
      金色的山谷
    翻过崎岖的山路，一过了冕宁，吉普车顺着广阔的安宁河谷，加快地向西昌驰去。平坦的公路上，一连十数里尽是高大的白杨，昔日曾被诸葛亮形容为荒凉不毛的地方，如今竟变得那么肥沃、富饶、美好！
    西昌，这座汉为邛都、唐为西宁州、元为建昌路的古城，现在是拥有一百四十多万各族人民的西昌专区的首府。这里气候温和，向有“四季无寒暑”之称，各种物产十分丰富，盛产大米、小麦、油菜、杂粮等农作物。在南部金沙江亚热带的河谷里，石榴、咖啡、木棉、芭蕉果样样都有。这儿的特产蜡虫，质量优良，每当三、四月蜡虫成熟季节，到处都是“蜀南虫客纷奔驰，穿岩越岭人如蚁”的熙攘景象。西昌城外风景秀丽的炉山，周围达六十里的邛海，更是游人迷恋的地方。平静如镜的水面，阵风一吹，一鳞鳞波浪，犹如千万只白鹅在游荡。
    西昌地区的群山里，蕴藏着巨量的矿产，铁、煤、铜、铅、锌、镍，金、水银等达数十种。据史料记载：远在三百多年前，我们的祖先就已经在这里开始开采矿产了。相传为明朝傥天山创办的木里洼里金矿，采金工人在清光绪年间一度达三万人以上，金块有的竟达三十一斤重。这些矿区，可惜后来都被荒废破坏了。解放后，在祖国工业化的进军中，一支为数达五千人的勘探大军，来到了这一带地方，白色的帐棚和高大的钻机，布立在周围的山岗上。在雅砻江流域内已经查明的盐边铁矿，现在再次证明是我国最大的铁矿之一。在那长达十余公里的矿体内，遍地都是露头闪光的矿石，铁的储量超过了国家公布的二亿八千万吨，矿石的含铁量也很高，足够在我国西南地区建立一个巨大钢铁基地的需要。在这个铁矿的附近，最近还发现一个储量很大、质量良好、可供炼焦的大煤田哩！
    一位最近从矿区归来的同志，向我描述这一带未来的发展远景时，激动地说：从西昌到金沙江边长达二百多公里的川滇西路上，竟日奔驰着满载各种勘探人员、设备的车辆。从成都经峨眉、西昌、会理的长达一千零五十公里左右的成昆铁路，也在进行测量了。可以相信：不久将来，这带金色的山谷，将会为祖国放射出更灿烂的光芒！
