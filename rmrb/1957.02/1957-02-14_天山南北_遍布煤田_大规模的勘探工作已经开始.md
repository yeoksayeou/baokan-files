Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 13th. A coalfield exploration team transferred from the interior to support the construction of coal mines in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region officially started work in the Urumqi coalfield on the 11th. So far, two exploration teams have started exploration activities in the Urumqi coalfield.

The scale of coalfield exploration in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region this year is very large. Six comprehensive exploration teams are conducting coalfield exploration work in five coalfields in Urumqi, Hami, and Yining. These exploration personnel will conduct coalfield reconnaissance and detailed surveys over a large area this year. Among them, the Urumqi coalfield will submit complete geological data for a large open-pit coal mine with an annual output of several million tons and two small coal mines in the first half of this year.

The underground coal reserves in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are very rich, and coal is found almost everywhere north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. In the past, the coalfields in various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region only had small kilns mined using indigenous methods and a few small coal mines, which can no longer meet the needs of economic development.

    天山南北　遍布煤田
    大规模的勘探工作已经开始
    新华社乌鲁木齐13日电　从内地调来支援新疆维吾尔自治区煤矿建设的一个煤田勘探队，11日在乌鲁木齐煤田正式开始。至此，在乌鲁木齐煤田已经有两个勘探队展开了勘探活动。
    新疆维吾尔自治区今年的煤田勘探规模很大。在乌鲁木齐、哈密、伊宁等五处煤田上，已经有六个综合性勘探队在进行煤田勘探工作。这些勘探人员今年要在很大的面积上进行煤田的普查和精查。其中，乌鲁木齐煤田在今年上半年就将提出一个年产量达数百万吨的大型露天煤矿和两个小型煤井的全部地质资料。
    新疆维吾尔自治区地下煤藏很丰富，天山南北几乎到处有煤。过去，新疆维吾尔自治区各地煤田只有土法开采的小窑和几处小型煤矿，现在已经不能满足经济发展的需要。
