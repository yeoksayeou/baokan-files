    Acquire More Goose and Duck Feathers
    Goose and duck feathers are one of China's important export commodities, with the largest production in Anhui, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces. These feathers are light, soft, warm, elastic, and friction-resistant, suitable for making quilts, sleeping bags, pillows, cushions, and clothing for aviation personnel. Feather shafts can be used to make feather fans, shuttlecocks, and various decorations. High-quality down mixed with other fluff can be woven into high-grade woolen fabrics. Therefore, goose and duck feathers have high economic value. Exporting one ton of duck feathers can be exchanged for twenty tons of steel; exporting one ton of white goose feathers can be exchanged for fifty-five tons of fertilizer. Farmers selling one jin of goose or duck feathers can buy more than two chi of white cloth or four jin of salt.
    China has a large output and good quality of goose and duck feathers, with a history of foreign sales for more than eighty years, sold to countries such as Germany, Britain, France, the United States, Denmark, and the Netherlands. However, because the production of goose and duck feathers is scattered, the acquisition is more troublesome and wasteful. The state cannot control all the sources of goods, and the acquisition rate in many areas is only 30%—40% of the output, far from meeting the needs of domestic and foreign sales.
    Currently, it is the peak season for acquiring goose and duck feathers. The purchasing departments should widely publicize to farmers to collect more goose and duck feathers to sell to the state, and should also adjust and improve the purchase price and methods.　　　　　　　Zhi Ge

    更多地收购鹅毛鸭毛
    鹅毛鸭毛是我国重要的出口商品之一，以安徽、江苏、广东、广西、湖北、湖南、四川等省出产的为最多。这种毛轻软温暖，富有弹性，耐摩擦，可絮制被褥、睡袋、枕头、垫子、航空人员的服装等；毛梗可制羽扇、羽毛球及各种装饰品；上等羽绒掺和别种绒毛又可织成上等毛呢衣料。因此，鹅鸭毛具有很高的经济价值，出口一吨鸭毛可换回钢材二十吨；出口一吨白鹅毛可换回肥田粉五十五吨；农民卖掉一斤鹅毛、鸭毛，就可以买回白细布二尺多或食盐四斤。
    我国鹅毛鸭毛产量大，品质好，迄今已有八十余年的外销历史，行销于德、英、法、美、丹麦、荷兰等国家。但是，由于鹅、鸭毛产量零星，收购起来比较麻烦，浪费很多，国家不能掌握全部货源，许多地区收购率仅占产量的30％—40％，远不能满足国内和外销的需要。
    目前正是收购鹅、鸭毛的旺季，收购部门应该广泛向农民宣传，收集更多的鹅毛、鸭毛卖给国家，并在收购价格和方法上也应该加以调整、改进。　　　　　　　止戈
