Xinhua News Agency dispatch:
Liaoning Provincial local industries utilized waste materials in 1956 to produce over 250 types of important products for industrial and agricultural production, including water pumps, diesel engines, drilling and mining machinery, double-wheel double-furrow plows, hoes, sickles, lawnmowers, saw blades, as well as daily necessities such as water buckets, shovels, refrigerators, iron pots, and heating boilers.

In Liaoning province's local industries, many enterprises mainly use recycled waste materials for production. The Anshan City Machinery Factory No. 1 used more than 2,000 tons of waste steel billets last year to manufacture over 30,000 sets of steel plates for large vehicles. Employees of the Fuxian Industrial Bureau Laboratory, the Fushun Pharmaceutical Factory, and the Benxi Chemical Factory, among others, used waste materials (including some by-products) from state-owned enterprises and their own factories to successfully trial-produce fourteen new products, including potassium chloride, superphosphate of lime, and large vehicle oil. Six of these have already entered formal production and are being sold, receiving a welcome from customers in various regions. Thirteen paper mills and fifteen handicraft production cooperatives in Liaoning province's local industry used recycled waste paper, cloth scraps, waste burlap bags, waste cotton yarn, and worn-out socks to produce more than 8,900 tons of roofing felt paper and more than 5,000 tons of various paperboards, as well as nearly 3,000 tons of wrapping paper, rope paper, toilet paper, and cement bag paper, supplying the needs of basic construction, production units, and people's lives in various regions.

The effective use of waste materials has not only solved the shortage of metal raw materials in various factories but has also greatly reduced production material costs.

    废料变成好产品
    新华社讯　辽宁省地方工业利用废料在1956年生产出工农业生产用的水泵、柴油机、钻探采矿机械、双轮双铧犁、锄头、镰刀、割草机、锯条，以及人民日常生活用的水桶、铁锹、冷冻机、铁锅、取暖锅炉等二百五十多种重要产品。
    辽宁省地方工业中，有许多企业主要利用回收的废料进行生产。鞍山市机械一厂去年利用废钢板坯两千多吨，制成三万多台大车用的钢板。复县工业局试验室、抚顺市制药厂、本溪市化工厂等单位职工，用国营企业和本企业的废料（包括一部分副产品），试制成功氯化钾、过磷酸钙、大车油等十四种新产品，其中有六种已经正式生产，并开始出售，受到各地顾客的欢迎。辽宁省地方工业中的十三个造纸厂和十五个手工业生产合作社，利用回收的废纸、布屑、废麻袋片、废棉纱、破袜，生产出八千九百多吨油毡纸和五千多吨各种纸板以及近三千吨包装纸、绳纸、手纸和水泥袋纸，供应了各地基本建设、生产单位和人民生活的需要。
    有效利用废材料不仅解决了各厂金属原料不足的困难，还使得生产材料费大大降低。
