Improve Tools, Save Steel

    (Our report) This reporter reports that Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory, in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, improved the pipe upsetting punch, increasing tool efficiency, and it is estimated that 19 tons of steel can be saved throughout the year.
    The pipe upsetting punch used by the pipe upsetting workshop of the Zhangjiakou Prospecting Factory was originally made of medium carbon steel. Each punch cost 7.5 yuan in labor and materials. In the upsetting process, each punch could only upset 25 to 30 drill pipes. A total of 4,440 punches were required throughout the year, equivalent to 31,080 yuan. During the increase production and practice economy campaign, Liu Yaohua, a technician from the tool section, devised a way to improve this tool and made a high-speed steel pipe upsetting punch, which increased work efficiency by 16.7 times compared to the medium carbon steel punch. Preliminary calculations show that 19 tons of steel can be saved throughout the year, saving 22,248 yuan. (Li Shaomi)

    改进工具，节约钢材
    本报讯　张家口探矿机械厂在增产节约运动中，改进了墩管冲头，提高工具效能，预计全年可节约钢材十九吨。
    张家口探矿厂管材车间墩管工段使用的墩管冲头，原来是使用中炭钢制做，每个冲头需用工料费七元五角，在墩粗工序中，每个冲头仅能做钻杆墩粗二十五到三十根，全年需用四千四百四十个，折合人民币三万一千零八十元。在增产节约运动中，工具科技术员刘耀华想办法改进这种工具，制成了高速钢墩管冲头，比中炭钢冲头，提高工作效能十六点七倍。初步计算全年能节省钢材十九吨，节约资金二万二千二百四十八元。　（李绍密）
