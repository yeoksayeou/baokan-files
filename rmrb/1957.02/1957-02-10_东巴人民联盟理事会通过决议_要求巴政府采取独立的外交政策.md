Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, February 9th. The East Pakistan People's League Council passed a resolution at a meeting held yesterday in Kagmari, near Dhaka, endorsing the resolutions passed at the Council's meetings in 1955 and 1956, including the foreign policy resolution calling for Pakistan to adopt an independent foreign policy and abolish all military treaties.

The meeting involved heated discussions. Supporters of Prime Minister Suhrawardy attempted to propose a motion expressing confidence in Pakistan's current foreign policy, but were unsuccessful.

The Council also authorized Maulana Bhashani to take appropriate disciplinary action against party members who violate the party's declared foreign policy.

The East Pakistan People's League Council meeting concluded yesterday. A total of about forty resolutions were passed on various aspects of domestic activities, particularly those relating to various issues in East Pakistan.

In a resolution, the Council advocated that general elections should be held in the central government and provinces in early 1958 in order to foster a healthy democratic life and promote the stability of parliamentary affairs.

Another resolution of the Council advocated that East Pakistan should implement full local autonomy based on the Twenty-One Point Program. The Twenty-One Point Program was a governing program put forward by the former United Front government of East Pakistan when it was in power. It was supported by the people because it advocated the abolition of the landlord system, the development of industry, and the abolition of security laws. The United Front abandoned this program after coming to power.

    东巴人民联盟理事会通过决议
    要求巴政府采取独立的外交政策
    新华社卡拉奇9日电　东巴基斯坦人民联盟理事会昨天在达卡附近的卡格马里举行的会议通过决议，赞成理事会在1955年和1956年的会议上所通过的各项决议，其中包括要求巴基斯坦采取独立的外交政策并且废除一切军事条约的外交政策决议。
    会议经过了激烈的讨论。支持苏拉瓦底总理的人曾经企图提出一项表示信任巴基斯坦现行外交政策的议案，但是没有成功。
    理事会还授权大毛拉巴沙尼对那些违反党所宣布的这种外交政策的党员，采取适当的惩戒行动。
    东巴基斯坦人民联盟理事会的会议已在昨天结束。会上共通过了有关国内活动的许多方面的决议约四十项，其中特别是关系到东巴基斯坦的各种问题。
    理事会在一项决议中主张，为了培养健康的民主生活和促进议会事务的稳定，应该在1958年初在中央和省内举行普选。
    理事会的另一项决议主张东巴基斯坦根据二十一点纲领实行充分的地方自治。二十一点纲领是东巴基斯坦前联合阵线政府在执政前提出的施政纲领，它由于主张废除地主制度、发展工业和废除安全法等而受到人民拥护。联合阵线在执政后背弃了这个纲领。
