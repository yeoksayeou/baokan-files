Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Recently, the Party and government leading organs of Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Hubei and other provinces issued instructions requiring the procurement units in various places to seize cotton procurement work, dispatch a large number of cadres to the countryside to carry out crash purchases, and strive to complete the 1956 state cotton unified purchase task.

The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee issued a joint notice on January 28, requiring all cotton-producing counties to quickly organize enough cotton purchasers to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives and mobilize the members to pick up fallen cotton and pull stalks to peel peach cotton in the cotton fields and on the cotton stalks. The notice pointed out: Agricultural cooperatives should pay the members' work points in cash, or let the members pick and sell themselves, and the cotton money belongs to the members, in order to give greater play to the enthusiasm of the members.

The Hebei Provincial People's Committee and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative issued instructions in early February, requiring all cotton-producing counties to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to mobilize sales, and stipulated that all grassroots units of the supply and marketing cooperatives should open scales for purchase.

The leading organs of Shandong, Shaanxi and Liaoning provinces have all required the grassroots procurement units to mobilize agricultural cooperatives to tap potential in all aspects to expand the amount of purchases. According to typical surveys, Shaanxi and Liaoning provinces can purchase an additional 60,000 dan of ginned cotton by mobilizing members to pick up clean and save self-retained cotton.

    山西河北等省突击收购棉花
    据新华社10日讯　最近山西、河北、河南、湖北等省党政领导机关发出指示，要求各地采购单位抓紧棉花收购工作，派遣大批干部下乡突击收购，努力完成1956年度国家的棉花统购任务。
    中共山西省委和山西省人民委员会于1月28日发出联合通知，要求各产棉县迅速组织足够的购棉人员，深入农业社发动社员在棉田里和棉秆上拣拾落地花和拔秆剥桃棉。通知指出：农业社应该以现金支付社员的工分，或者由社员自拣自售，棉款归社员所有，以发挥社员群众更大的积极性。
    河北省人民委员会和供销合作社已分别于本月上旬发出指示，要求各产棉县深入农业社动员出售，并且规定供销合作社各基层单位一律开秤收购。
    山东省、陕西省和辽宁省的领导机关都要求各基层采购单位发动农业社从各方面挖掘潜力以扩大收购数量。根据典型调查，陕西省和辽宁省发动社员拾干拣净和节约自留棉，可多收购皮棉六万担。
