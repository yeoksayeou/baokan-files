    Correctly Implement the Party's Ethnic Policies and Cadre Policies
    Ethnic Minority Cadres in Jerim League Rapidly Mature
    (Reported by this newspaper) The CCP Jerim League committees at all levels in Inner Mongolia have, in recent years, correctly implemented the Party's ethnic policies and cadre policies, cultivated and promoted a large number of ethnic minority cadres, enabling them to mature quickly.
    Jerim League currently has 2,593 ethnic minority cadres, accounting for approximately 21% of the total number of cadres in the league. In order to meet the needs of the development of local cultural and educational undertakings, the league has trained more than 1,500 ethnic minority primary and secondary school teachers, accounting for more than 30% of the total number of teachers in the league. In the cultivation of ethnic minority cadres, attention has also been paid to the training of technical personnel. Currently, among the ethnic minority cadres in the league, there are eight senior technical cadres and two hundred general technical cadres. They are working in departments such as agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, medicine and health, industry, transportation, and postal and telecommunications.
    In recent years, the CCP Jerim League committees at all levels have promoted many ethnic minority cadres in accordance with the Party's cadre policy of "both virtue and talent." In 1956 alone, 210 Mongolian cadres were promoted, accounting for 7.7% of the total number of cadres of this ethnic group and 38.7% of the total number of cadres promoted in the league throughout the year. At present, Party and state organs in the Jerim League area have ethnic minority leading cadres. With the exception of Tongliao City, county, and Kailu County, where the Han population is larger, the other five banners have eight banner party committee secretaries and deputy secretaries, and eight banner heads and deputy banner heads who are ethnic minority cadres. Among the 20 league committee members, department heads and deputy department heads, 10 are ethnic minority cadres, and two of the three league leaders are Mongolian cadres. In addition, 18 ethnic minority cadres serve as directors and deputy directors in various organs, accounting for approximately half of the total number of division-level cadres in the league.
    In recent years, ethnic minority cadres have improved their political thought, professional abilities, and cultural levels through various social reforms and mass movements, and they have played a significant role in the cause of socialist construction. (An Changsuo)

    哲里木盟现有少数民族干部二千五百九十三名，约占全盟干部总数的21％。为了适应当地文教事业发展的需要，全盟已培养出一千五百多名少数民族中、小学教师，约占全盟教师总数的30％以上。在培养少数民族干部中还注意培养了技术人员。目前，全盟少数民族干部中有高级技术干部八名、一般技术干部二百名。他们分布在农林、畜牧、水利、医药卫生、工业、交通邮电等部门工作。
    几年来，中共哲里木盟各级党委根据党的“德才兼备”的干部政策，提拔了许多少数民族干部。仅1956年，就提拔了蒙古族干部二百一十名，占本民族干部的7.7％，占全盟全年提拔干部总数的38.7％。目前，哲里木盟地区的党和国家机关中都有了少数民族领导干部。除了汉族居多的通辽市、县、开鲁县外，其他五个旗有八个旗委正、副书记和八个正、副旗长是少数民族干部。在二十名盟委委员和正、副部长中有十人是少数民族干部，三位盟长中有二人是蒙古族干部。还有十八名少数民族干部在各机关担任正、副处长，约占全盟处长级干部总数的一半。
