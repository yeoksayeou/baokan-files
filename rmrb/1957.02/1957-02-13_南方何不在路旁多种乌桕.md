    Why Not Plant More Chinese Tallow Trees Along Roadsides in the South?
    Planting roadside trees along highways and railways not only protects the roadbed and surface but also beautifies nature. However, in the selection of tree species, most people use poplar, black locust, and other trees of little economic value. If we pay attention to changing the tree species and try to plant economic tree species as much as possible, we can create a large amount of wealth for the country. Especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces, if Chinese tallow trees are planted instead, they will also have a good road protection effect. In autumn, the bright red tallow leaves will decorate the entire route beautifully. Generally, two- or three-year-old seedlings of Chinese tallow trees are grafted with improved varieties and then transplanted along the roadside around the vernal equinox of the following year. After four years, the tree height will reach more than fifteen feet and begin to bear fruit. By the sixth or seventh year, each tree can produce about twenty catties of tallow seeds per year, which is worth 2.60 yuan at the current purchase price of thirteen yuan per dan. According to the standard of five meters spacing for roadside trees along general highways, 402 Chinese tallow trees can be planted on both sides of each kilometer of highway, producing more than 8,000 catties of tallow seeds per year, worth more than 1,400 yuan. The income from this item on each road can exceed the total wages of the rural road maintenance workers in the local area.

    南方何不在路旁多种乌桕
    在公路、铁路线两旁种植行道树，不仅可以保护路基路面，而且能美化大自然。但在树种的选择上，大家所采用的多半是经济价值不甚高的白杨、刺槐等等。如果注意改变一下树种，尽可能改种经济树种，就能为国家创造大量的财富。尤其在江苏、浙江、湖南、安徽等省，如果改种乌桕，也具有良好的护路作用；一到秋天，鲜红的桕叶，把整条路线装扮得美极了。一般乌桕用两三年生的实生苗，通过良种嫁接成活以后，次年春分左右移栽道旁，四年后树高即达一丈五尺以上，开始结果；到第六年或第七年，每年每树就可以生产桕籽约二十斤，以现在每担收购价格十三元计，就值二元六角。按一般公路行道树间距五公尺的标准，则每公里公路两旁就可种植乌桕四百零二株，每年可产桕籽八千多斤，值一千四百多元。各路的这项收入，可以超过当地乡村公路养路工人的工资总数。
