Experiences on Several Issues in Higher Industrial Education
Professor of Electrical Engineering Department, Tsinghua University, Huang Mei

Our country's higher education reform work has more than four years of experience. Recently, the Ministry of Higher Education, through revising the teaching plans of several engineering majors, has conducted research and discussion on some major issues in higher industrial education nationwide. This will greatly help to further deepen teaching reform and improve the quality of training in various engineering majors. I would like to talk about some personal experiences on some of these issues below.

Evaluation of Teaching Reform and Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union

Our country's higher industrial education can be divided into two periods, with the teaching reform that began in 1952 as the boundary. If we compare the quality of graduates in these two periods, we can make a reasonable evaluation of the work of teaching reform and learning from the Soviet Union. Before the teaching reform, the training method was based on departments without distinguishing majors, and graduates were "generalists" in electrical engineering, machinery, civil engineering, or chemical engineering. Their theoretical foundation training was not bad, but they lacked professional theoretical training and practical production knowledge. Even in the simple situation of backward production at that time, graduates still had a considerable distance from production work and could not independently undertake work without one or two years of experience. In today's world where science and technology have greatly developed and our country is carrying out large-scale socialist industrial construction, it is obvious that such talents are even more unable to meet the requirements of complex production tasks. After liberation, the phenomenon of new technologies being unknown to anyone could be seen everywhere. It cannot be said that this "generalist" education is not one of the main reasons for this.

Since the teaching reform and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the face of old China's industrial education has been fundamentally changed, and the quality of graduates has improved. From a business perspective, they have not only learned more basic theoretical knowledge than in the past, but also learned a lot of professional knowledge and practical production knowledge.

Looking at the independent working ability of graduates, for engineering graduates, independent working ability should include the ability to learn from literature and data, the ability to learn from practice, and the ability to apply what they have learned to solve engineering problems, as well as the ability in calculation, drawing, and experimentation. Due to a series of exercises, assignments, experiments, course designs, production internships, and graduation designs, the current graduates are much stronger than the past in all aspects except for the ability to learn from literature and data, which is comparable to the past.

Because they have both theory and technology, and the theory is linked to practice, coupled with a certain degree of independent working ability, they can take on work as soon as they graduate (I do not particularly emphasize this point), which is of great significance to our country's socialist industrial construction. Therefore, the teaching reform and learning from the Soviet Union in the past four years have achieved great results. The achievements not only lie in the fact that we have trained a certain number of high-quality industrial cadres, but more importantly, we have established a socialist ideological system in education in our country, set up many new majors, and trained a large number of teachers who have initially mastered modern technology, thereby laying the foundation for industrial education in our country.

However, there are still some shortcomings in the past work. I think the main shortcomings are the narrow and specialized training, the large number of courses, and the bulky content of both basic and professional courses, which leads to excessive learning burden, insufficient consolidation of learning, and insufficient cultivation of independent working ability. However, the reasons for these shortcomings are multifaceted. Some are due to our insufficient efforts and the lack of time for teachers to grow, but the more fundamental reason is that we do not understand many things and lack experience, which leads to formalism and dogmatism. These shortcomings are shortcomings in progress, and they are definitely not caused by problems with the policy of teaching reform and learning from the Soviet Union; nor can we doubt that the current education system is all bad and the past was all good because of these shortcomings and seeing some individual advantages of the old education system and the education system of capitalist countries. Therefore, the direction of future efforts is to further study the essence of each teaching link on the basis of the experience gained from teaching reform and learning from the Soviet Union, and to study how to combine it with China's reality to further improve the quality of training. I believe we will be able to accomplish this task.

The Training Objectives of Higher Industrial Schools

There are differing opinions on whether the training objective of higher industrial schools should be "engineer." I think the training objective should still be defined as "engineer," because defining the training objective as "engineer" cannot be understood as training skilled engineers in universities. Obviously, it is impossible to train skilled engineers in schools, nor should it be done this way. However, schools can train people who have the basic ability of engineers. The basic ability of an engineer refers to the sum of a solid foundation of scientific theory, a foundation of technical theory, and a foundation of professional theory, a certain amount of professional technical knowledge, plus a fairly high degree of independent working ability. Now I will briefly explain as follows:

Schools should not only be places to impart knowledge, simply regarding students' brains as "warehouses" of knowledge. More fundamentally, they should teach students how to use existing knowledge to "reproduce" knowledge, and how to apply existing knowledge to solve problems. Therefore, basic ability should be the sum of some necessary basic knowledge plus independent working ability; that is to say, school training should focus on laying a good foundation and cultivating independent working ability.

In terms of laying the foundation, laying a good theoretical foundation is fundamental, because only in this way is it possible for students to "understand by analogy" and "infer from one instance." However, the theoretical foundation should include three parts: scientific theory, technical theory, and professional theory. The first two parts can be emphasized more, but professional theory should not be overly neglected. Some people seem to have a tendency to think that the first priority is to ensure scientific theory training and technical theory training, and professional courses are secondary and can be greatly reduced, with whatever time is left being allocated to them. However, I think this view is not comprehensive enough. It may be a conclusion drawn without carefully considering the nature of professional courses, the relationship between various types of courses such as professional courses, scientific theory courses, and technical theory courses, and the role of professional courses in the work of engineers.

The content of professional courses is not a accumulation of production experience, but a further development of scientific theory and technical theory in a specific professional field, as well as the laws abstracted from production practice. Learning these courses actually plays a role in consolidating and expanding scientific theory and technical theory. For example, if you learn a lot of mathematics, and you are indeed proficient when learning it, if you do not apply and develop it in professional courses, you will still forget it, and it will still only stay at the mathematics knowledge itself, and cannot be combined with using it to solve engineering problems.

More importantly, professional courses play a very important role in the future work of graduates. For example, if students majoring in power plants, power grids, and power systems only learn mathematics, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering fundamentals, motor learning, and electronics, but do not learn the most basic professional theoretical knowledge of power systems, power plants, relay protection, and automation, then they will return to the old path of "electrical engineering generalists" and will not be able to meet the requirements of work; because this professional knowledge is the result of scientific research and technological development in recent decades, and without this basic knowledge, it is impossible to work in power plants and power systems.

Emphasizing a good theoretical foundation does not mean neglecting professional technical knowledge. Some professional technical knowledge can be reduced or learned in other teaching links, such as design, experiments, and internships, but necessary content should still be taught in class. Otherwise, the trained people will not understand the basic laws of production, and will not understand the basic viewpoints and methods for dealing with production problems. Obviously, such talents cannot meet the requirements of our country's socialist industrial construction.

Therefore, it is believed that scientific theory, technical theory, and professional courses should be considered comprehensively. The first two types can be emphasized more, but professional courses should not be too few.

Regarding the meaning of independent working ability, engineering students should also be different from students in other departments, and should include the content mentioned above.

The above-mentioned basic abilities of engineers are proposed after considering the requirements of our country's socialist industrial construction for engineering university graduates and considering how schools should conduct training in accordance with educational principles, so they should be used as the criteria for training engineering personnel in higher education institutions. Such talents can not only do today's work well, but also do tomorrow's work well; they can not only adapt to the development of science and technology, but also promote the development of science and technology. They can not only undertake production work, but also undertake scientific research work and teaching work. The essence of the talents that engineering universities want to train is like this, so it is appropriate to define the training goal as an engineer. It sets a relatively clear and specific training standard for us, that is, to train some people with the basic ability of engineers, who can take on the responsibilities of engineers after three or four years of training in their work posts.

Some people think that it is better to use "senior technical personnel" or "senior industrial construction talents" as training goals, but I think such training goals are vague. Some people also believe that if the training goal is an engineer, it will not pay attention to basic training and emphasize professional training, causing narrow and specialized training, complicated courses, and excessive learning burden. In fact, the reason why these kinds of shortcomings occurred in the past is not because the training goal is an engineer, but because of some reasons mentioned above, coupled with an incorrect understanding of the question of what kind of people schools should train and how to train them. Therefore, if it is believed that higher industrial schools should train some people with the basic ability of engineers, then why not define the training goal as an engineer, but use some vague terms as training goals?

The above is just some views on the training goals. As for what the degree should be called, it is a secondary issue. The key lies in how we understand the essence of the people we train.

Opinions on Achieving Training Goals and Improving Quality

To achieve the above-mentioned training goals, a series of measures are required. I think the main measures are the following aspects:

In the teaching plan, it is necessary to ensure that students have more time for self-study, so as to consolidate what they have learned in class and develop their independent working ability. Training should not be narrow and specialized, and specialization should not be set up unless necessary; if some majors have to be specialized, they should be divided as broadly as possible, and the amount of specialized courses should be as small as possible. Only in this way can students have greater adaptability in their future work, and can the professional theoretical foundation be strengthened under the condition of ensuring the foundation of scientific theory and the foundation of technical theory. Secondary professional courses can be cancelled, and the necessary parts of their content can be learned in other courses or other teaching links. Some professional courses can be merged to avoid repetition and make them more compact and systematic. Some professional courses can have their content re-divided and reorganized into a more reasonable system.

The content of lectures should be as few and精 as possible. Especially for professional courses, avoid talking about one problem in isolation from another. Find the inherent connection between the problems, or first explain the inherent connection of these problems, then give a few examples to illustrate them, or use a few examples to illustrate the inherent connection between these problems, which may be better. In this way, there will be a system that enables students to learn the most basic laws, save time, and talk about the most basic content in a shorter time.

Improve the quality of experiments, course designs, and graduation designs, improve their content, and strictly require them, but they can be done less and done better.

Be bold and give students a free hand with leadership. The so-called "giving a free hand with leadership" means having requirements and helping to inspire, which is different from laissez-faire, and also different from "picking up" students and sending them over as soon as they encounter difficulties. The latter is relatively easy to do, but it is more difficult to have requirements and give students inspiration and help, so we must boldly strive to do it.

Achieving the above-mentioned training goals also requires teachers to have a higher scientific level, and also requires relatively suitable textbooks. All of the above requires a lot of hard work and a series of efforts to achieve. But we will definitely achieve it.

    对高等工业教育几个问题的体会	清华大学电机工程系教授　黄眉
    我国高等教育改革工作已有四年多的经验。最近高等教育部通过修订几个工科专业教学计划对我国高等工业教育中一些主要问题，在全国范围内进行研究和讨论，这对进一步深入进行教学改革，提高工科各专业的培养质量将起很大作用。下面想谈谈个人对其中几个问题的一些体会。
    对教学改革和学习苏联先进经验的估价
    我国高等工业教育可以1952年开始教学改革时为界，分为两个时期来看。如果把这两个时期的毕业生质量作一对比，就可对教学改革学习苏联这一工作作出合理的评价来。在教学改革以前，是采取按系而不分专业的培养方式，毕业生是电机、机械、土木或化工的“通才”。他们的理论基础训练还不算坏，但缺乏专业理论训练和生产实际知识，即便在当时生产落后的简单情况下，毕业生还是和生产工作有相当大的距离，非经过一两年不能独立担当工作。在世界科学技术已大大发展，我国正在进行大规模社会主义工业建设的今天，很显然，这种人才就更不能满足复杂生产任务的要求了。解放后，到处可以看到新技术没有人懂的现象，这种“通才”教育不能说不是其主要原因之一。
    自从教学改革学习苏联先进经验以来，根本改变了旧中国工业教育的面貌，毕业生的质量提高了。单就业务方面看，他们不但比过去学习了更多的基础理论知识，而且学到了不少专业知识和实际生产知识。
    再从毕业生的独立工作能力方面来看，对工科毕业生来说，独立工作能力应该包括向文献资料学习的能力，向实际学习的能力和应用所学解决工程问题的能力以及计算制图实验等方面的能力。由于通过了一系列的习题、作业、实验、课程设计、生产实习和毕业设计等训练，现在的毕业生除向资料文献学习的能力和过去的不相上下外，其他都比过去的强得多。
    由于他们有理论又有技术，而且理论是联系实际的，再加上有一定的独立工作能力，因而一毕业就能担负起工作（我没有特别强调这一点的意思），这对我国社会主义工业建设是有非常大的意义的。因此，过去四年多进行教学改革学习苏联的工作获得了巨大的成绩，成绩不仅在于我们已经培养了若干数目的质量较好的工业干部，更重要的在于在我国已经建立了社会主义思想体系的教育制度，设置了很多新的专业，并且培养出大批初步掌握现代技术的师资力量，从而奠定了我国工业教育的基础。
    但是在过去的工作中，还存在一些缺点。我认为最主要的缺点是培养较窄较专，课程名目较多，无论基础课或专业课内容都嫌臃肿，因而引起学习负担过重，学习不够巩固，独立工作能力的培养也不够。但是，产生这些缺点的原因是多方面的，有的是我们努力还不够，师资力量也来不及成长，但更基本的是我们许多东西不懂，没有经验，从而产生形式主义和教条主义的偏向。这些缺点是前进中的缺点，决不是因为教学改革学习苏联的方针有问题而产生这些缺点；更不能由于产生了这些缺点，并看到了旧教育制度和资本主义国家教育制度的某些个别优点，就怀疑现行教育制度什么都不好而过去什么都好。因此今后努力的方向就是要在教学改革学习苏联获得一些经验的基础上，进一步研究各个教学环节的实质，研究如何结合中国实际，使培养质量更进一步提高。我相信我们一定能够完成这一任务。
    高等工业学校的培养目标
    对于高等工业学校的培养目标，应不应当是“工程师”的问题，意见是不一致的。我认为培养目标还是应该定为“工程师”，因为培养目标是“工程师”不能理解为在高等学校要培养出熟练的工程师。很显然，学校里不可能培养出熟练的工程师，也不应当这样去作。但是学校里可以培养出具备工程师的基本能力的人来。工程师的基本能力是指坚实的科学理论基础，技术理论基础和专业理论基础，一定的专业技术知识加上相当高的独立工作能力的总和。现在简略说明如下：
    学校不应当只是传授知识的场所，把学生的脑袋单纯看成知识的“仓库”，更基本的应当是教会学生如何利用已有的知识去“再生产”知识，而且会应用已有知识去解决问题。因此基本能力应该是一些必要的基础知识加上独立工作能力的总和；也就是说学校的培养应该着重打好基础并培养独立工作能力。
    在打基础方面，打好理论基础是根本之图，因为只有这样才有可能使学生“触类旁通”，“举一反三”。但是理论基础应该包括科学理论、技术理论和专业理论三部分，前二部分可以更着重些，但专业理论也不可过分忽视，有人似乎有这样一种倾向，认为首先要保证科学理论训练和技术理论训练，专业课是次要的，可以大大削减，时间剩下多少就是多少。我却认为这种看法不够全面，可能是没有很好考虑专业课的性质，没有很好考虑专业课、科学理论课、技术理论课各类课程之间的关系以及专业课对工程师工作所起的作用等所得出的结论。
    专业课的内容并不是生产经验的堆砌，而是科学理论和技术理论在某一专业范围内的进一步发展以及从生产实践中抽象出来的规律。学习这些课程实际上对科学理论和技术理论起着巩固和扩大的作用。例如学了很多数学，而且在学的时候的确熟练，如果不在专业课中加以应用和发展，还是会忘记的，还是只停留在数学知识本身，不能和用它去解决工程问题结合起来。
    更重要的是专业课对毕业生将来的工作起着非常重要的作用。例如发电厂电力网及电力系统专业学生只学好了数理化、电工基础、电机学和电子学而没有学好电力系统，发电厂和继电保护、自动学等方面最基本的专业理论知识，那又将回到“电机通才”的老路而不能满足工作要求；因为这些专业知识是近几十年来科学研究和生产技术发展的成果，没有这方面的基础知识是无法在发电厂和电力系统进行工作的。
    强调打好理论基础，并不意味着不重视专业技术知识。有些专业技术知识，可以削减或放在其它教学环节，如设计、实验、实习中去学，但必要的内容还应在课堂讲授。否则所培养的人就会不懂得生产的基本规律，不懂得处理生产问题的基本观点和方法。很显然，这样的人才是不能满足我国社会主义工业建设的要求的。
    因此认为对于科学理论、技术理论和专业课要通盘考虑，前二类可着重些，但专业课也不可过少。
    关于独立工作能力的含义，工科学生也应该和其他科系学生的不同，应该包括上面所提到的内容。
    上面所谈的工程师的一些基本能力是考虑了我国社会主义工业建设对工科大学毕业生的要求，并按照教育原则考虑了学校应该如何进行培养而提出的，因此应该作为高等学校培养工程人员的准则。这样的人才，不但能做好今天的工作而且能做好明天的工作；不但能适应科学技术的发展而且能推动科学技术的发展。他们不但能担负生产工作，其中一部分还可担负科学研究工作和教学工作。工科大学所要培养的人才，其实质就是如此，所以把培养目标定为工程师是恰当的。它给我们定下了比较清楚而具体的培养标准，那就是要培养一些具备工程师基本能力的人，他们在工作岗位上锻炼三几年就能够担当起工程师的职责。
    有人认为用“高级技术人员”或“高级工业建设人才”作为培养目标好一些，我却觉得这样的培养目标是含混不清的。也有人认为如果用工程师作为培养目标，就会不重视基础训练而强调专业训练，引起培养窄而专，课程庞杂，学习负担过重等现象。其实，过去所以产生这一类的缺点，并不是由于培养目标是工程师，而是由于上面已经提到的一些原因，加上学校应该培养什么样的人以及如何去培养等问题的认识不够正确所引起的。因此如果认为高等工业学校所培养的应当是一些具备工程师基本能力的人，那又何必要不把培养目标定为工程师，而去用一些不确切的名词来作为培养目标呢？
    以上所谈只是对培养目标的一些看法，至于学位用什么称号是一次要问题，关键在于我们对所培养的人的实质如何理解。
    对实现培养目标提高质量的意见
    要实现上述培养目标，是需要采取一系列措施的。我认为主要措施有下列几方面：
    在教学计划中要保证学生有较多的自学时间，以巩固课堂所学并发展其独立工作能力。培养不宜窄而专，非在必要时不设专门化；如果有的专业非分专门化不可时，则要尽量分得宽些，而且专门课程分量要使尽量少些。只有这样才能使学生将来在工作中有较大的适应性，才能在保证科学理论基础和技术理论基础的条件下，使专业理论基础得到加强。次要的专业课可以取消，将其内容的必要部分放在其他课程或其他教学环节中去学。有些专业课可以合并，使避免重复，做到更紧凑，更有系统。有些专业课可以把内容重新划分，整理出更合理的系统来。
    讲课内容要力求少而精，尤其对专业课要避免一个一个问题孤立地去讲，要找出各问题间的内在联系，或先讲清这些问题的内在联系的规律然后举几个例子加以说明，或用几个例子来阐明这些问题间的内在联系规律，可能是比较好的。这样就会既有系统，使学生学到了最基本的规律，又可节省时间，可在较少时间下讲出最基本的内容。
    要提高实验、课程设计、毕业设计的质量，要改进其内容，严格其要求，但可作得少些，作得好些。
    对学生要大胆有领导地放手。所谓有领导地放手是有要求，有帮助启发的意思，不同于放任不管，也不同于看学生一遇到困难就一把“抱起来”送他过去。后面这样做是比较容易的，而作到对学生有要求又有启发和帮助是比较难的，所以要大胆努力去作。
    实现上述培养目标，还要求教师有更高的科学水平，还要求有比较适合的教科书，所有以上这些都需要付出巨大的劳动，作一系列努力，才能达到。但我们一定能达到。
