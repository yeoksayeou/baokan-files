Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 19th. Hubei Province's financial and economic departments have delivered large quantities of spring ploughing production materials to the countryside in advance this year. As of now, the quantity of production materials such as pesticides, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and new-style agricultural implement parts that the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has transported to grassroots cooperatives in various regions has exceeded or is approaching the total quantity supplied last year. To learn from last year's lesson, where the late delivery of chemical fertilizers meant they did not arrive in time for topdressing, leading to a missed farming season, the first batch of over 24,000 tons of chemical fertilizers was completely transferred to the grassroots cooperatives by the end of January, more than one to two months earlier than last year. The supply quantities of various production materials have increased compared to last year. For example, the total amount of various pesticides supplied to farmers last year was only 6,000 tons, but the current inventory has reached 9,000 tons; the number of various agricultural machines supplied last year was only 120,000, but the current inventory has reached 150,000. Regarding fertilizers, in addition to supplying farmers with chemical fertilizers, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also urged grassroots cooperatives to help farmers organize 1.5 million tons of miscellaneous fertilizers.

The Provincial Grain Department also transported 2 million jin of Nan Te Hao rice seeds, transferred from Jiangxi Province, to the grassroots supply points by the end of January; the seed adjustment work between various special districts in the province is proceeding intensely. This year, the Grain Department also specially transported 20,000 jin of excellent millet varieties from Henan Province to supply to Tianmen, Mianyang, and other counties that produce millet, as well as the northern Hubei region.

The Hubei Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China has also formulated a spring ploughing production loan plan based on the actual needs of the countryside.

The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also started technical training classes. The more than 120 supply and marketing cooperative cadres currently undergoing training will soon go to various places to teach grassroots cooperative cadres and farmers how to use pesticides and machinery.

    接受去年教训，力求不误农时！
    湖北财经部门提前运送大批春耕物资下乡
    新华社武汉19日电　湖北省财经部门今年提前把大批春耕生产资料调往农村。到目前为止，湖北省供销合作社运到各地基层社的农药、农械、化学肥料、新式农具零件等生产资料，已经超过或接近去年全年供应的数量。为接受去年下调化学肥料太迟，没有赶上追肥时间，以致误了农时的教训，今年首批二万四千多吨化学肥料在1月底已全部调至基层社，比去年提早了一个多月到两个月。各种生产资料的供应数量都比去年增多。如去年全年供应农民的各种农药只有六千吨，现在库存量已达到九千吨；去年供应的各种农械只十二万部，现在库存量已达到十五万部。在肥料方面，除供应农民化学肥料外，省供销社还督促各基层社帮助农民组织一百五十万吨杂肥。
    省粮食部门也早在1月底就把从江西省调来的二百万斤南特号稻种分运到了基层供应点；省内各专区之间的种籽调剂工作，正在紧张的进行着。粮食部门今年还特地从河南省运来了两万斤粟谷的优良品种，供应给产小米的天门、沔阳等县和鄂北地区。
    中国农业银行湖北省分行也根据农村实际需要，订出了春耕生产贷款计划。
    省供销社还开办了技术训练班，正在受训练的一百二十多个供销社干部不久将到各地向基层社干部和农民传授使用农药械的方法。
