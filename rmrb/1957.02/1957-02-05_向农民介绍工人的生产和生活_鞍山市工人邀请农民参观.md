Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 4th – On the second day of the Spring Festival, Anshan workers invited peasants from the suburbs to visit the city and participate in a get-together.

　　In the morning, the workers accompanied more than ninety peasant representatives to visit the seamless steel pipe factory, which had the best working conditions, and the steelmaking plant, which had poorer working conditions. They also viewed the tidy workers' dormitories on Friendship Street and the simple dwellings. They allowed the peasants to gain a relatively comprehensive understanding of the workers' production and living conditions. In the afternoon, they held a get-together.

　　The peasants saw the seamless steel pipe factory workers lightly flipping switches to produce steel pipes, and they also saw the steelmaking workers wielding large shovels to send magnesite into the open-hearth furnace with a temperature of over 1,000 degrees. The red-lacquered floors of the Friendship Street workers' dormitory were polished so brightly that they reflected people's images, but there were also many workers whose families of seven or eight people were crammed into small mud houses. Wei Rongheng, director of the Cheng'angbao Agricultural Cooperative, said: "Seeing how hard the steelmaking workers work, it's scorching even in winter, I don't know how they endure it in summer. I will tell the cooperative members when I get back, don't just look at the workers wearing serge trousers and living in big Western-style houses, thinking their work is easy; you must know that many workers are living very hard." The peasants also saw the Liberation brand trucks manufactured by the First Automobile Works. Zhang Wenzhi, an agricultural labor model, carefully touched every part of the truck and said: "The motherland's industry is developing so fast, our agriculture must catch up quickly and produce more non-staple foods needed by the workers."

　　Every factory in Anshan has close ties with agricultural cooperatives and they often support each other. When the Liming Agricultural Cooperative bought a diesel engine, no one could install it, so the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department used their spare time to help them install it. When the First Thin Plate Factory lacked carpenters, many steel plates could not be packed in time to be shipped to various places, so the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative sent more than a dozen carpenters to help.

    向农民介绍工人的生产和生活
    鞍山市工人邀请农民参观
    新华社鞍山4日电　在春节的第二天，鞍山市工人邀请了郊区的农民来市区参观和联欢。
    上午，工人们随着九十多个农民代表参观了劳动条件最好的无缝钢管厂和劳动条件较差的炼钢厂，还观看了整齐的友好街工人宿舍和简陋的住宅。他们让农民比较全面地了解工人的生产和生活条件。下午，他们在一起举行了联欢会。
    农民们见到了无缝钢管厂工人轻轻地扳动电钮生产着钢管，也见到了炼钢工人抡着大铲往一千多度高温的平炉内送镁砂的情景。友好街工人宿舍的红漆地板擦的亮得可以照见人影，但也有很多工人一家七、八口人挤在一间小土房子里。城昂堡农业社主任魏荣衡说：“看这炼钢工人干活多累，冬天还烤的灼人，夏天真不知怎样过。我回去要告诉社员们，不要尽看工人穿呢料子裤、住大洋房，干活很轻松，要知道还有很多工人是很艰苦的。”农民们还看到了第一汽车制造厂制造的解放牌汽车，农业劳动模范张文志仔细地摸着汽车的每一个部件说：祖国的工业发展的多快，我们农业一定要很快地赶上去，多生产工人需要的副食品。
    鞍山的每个工厂都与农业社有密切的联系，经常互相支援。黎明农业社买了一台柴油机，没有人安装，鞍钢运输部的工人就利用业余的时间帮助他们安装。第一薄板厂木工不够，很多钢板不能及时装箱运到各地去，曙光农业社就派了十几名木工来帮忙。
