    Xinhua News Agency, February 4th dispatch from Paris: After five days of discussion, the French National Assembly passed the Mollet government's bill on granting so-called "local autonomy" to French West Africa, Equatorial Africa, and Madagascar on the 2nd.

    According to the bill passed by the National Assembly, the assembly of each French territory in these regions will elect a government committee composed of six to twelve people. The French Governor-General will serve as the chairman of this committee. "Autonomy" is limited only to local administrative affairs. As for foreign affairs, internal and external security, higher education, external transportation, radio broadcasting, courts dealing with French law, the implementation of labor law, financial and monetary management, and overall economic, social, and cultural plans, these will still be under French control.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 4th dispatch from Washington: French Foreign Minister Pineau stated in a television broadcast on the 3rd, in response to questions from American reporters, that France would never agree to grant Algeria complete autonomy.

    When asked whether France would withdraw from the meeting if the United Nations discussed the Algerian issue, Pineau said that he would first consult with the French delegation to the United Nations. He also said that he hoped the United States would express its support for France "on any motion made in the General Assembly that is unfavorable to France."

    法国民议会决定在法属西非等地区
    用“地方自治”骗局挽救殖民统治危机
    比诺叫嚷永远不让阿尔及利亚完全自治
    据新华社4日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会经过五天讨论，于2日通过了摩勒政府关于给予法属西非、赤道非洲以及马达加斯加以所谓“地方自治”的法案。
    根据国民议会通过的法案，这些地区的每一个法国领地的议会，将选举一个由六人到十二人组成的政府委员会。这个委员会由法国总督充任主席。“自治权”仅限于地方行政事务。至于外交、内部和外部安全、高等教育、对外交通、广播、处理法国法律的法庭、实施劳动法、财政和货币管理以及全盘的经济、社会、文化计划等，仍然由法国掌管。
    据新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：法国外交部长比诺3日在电视广播中答复美国记者的问题时，表示法国永远不会同意给予阿尔及利亚完全的自治。
    当有人问到如果联合国讨论阿尔及利亚问题时法国是否会退出会议，比诺说，他先要同法国驻联合国代表团商量。又说，他希望在大会作出的“任何不利于法国的动议上”，美国会对法国表示支持。
