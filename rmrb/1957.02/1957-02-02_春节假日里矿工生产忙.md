    On New Year's Eve, many workers at the Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine finished their dinner and, instead of going to the club to dance or to the streets to watch the festivities, put on their work clothes and happily headed towards the mine. By a little after 7:00 PM, the rest rooms in various sections of the open-pit mine were already filled with workers who were going to take over the midnight shift. They were preparing their energy to fire the first shot of increased production during the Spring Festival holiday.

    At 11:00 PM, when the mine director announced the plan for the first shift of increased production during the Spring Festival holiday to the section chiefs via telephone, the workers had already arrived, full of energy and ready to go. Before the section chiefs conveyed the message to the workers, the chairman of the mine trade union, leaders from the city committee, the Shenyang Coal Mining Administration, and the Liaoning Provincial Trade Union came to congratulate the workers on the Spring Festival and to express their regards. The workers cheered in unison, guaranteeing that they would complete the task of increasing production.

    The clock had struck twelve, and the glorious moment of increased production began.

    Although people were doing the same work as usual today, their mood was somewhat different. Everyone was thinking: today's production is in response to the call of the State Council, and it is during the Spring Festival holiday, so we must produce more coal for the factories and cities. Wang Xiaocheng, the driver of electric shovel No. 95, quickly checked the electric shovel. With a "whoosh," he suddenly started the electric shovel. In the dim light, the water vapor rising from the ground filled the area around the electric shovel. However, he skillfully and quickly scooped the black coal into the mine cars one scoop after another. "Coal, this is coal! One scoop is three cubic meters, four tons, enough for four or five families to burn for a year." The chairman of the mine trade union and the staff of the city industrial department stood next to the electric shovel, observing the operation of the electric shovel with satisfaction, chatting and laughing.

    At this time, more than twenty electric shovels were in production in the open-pit mine. The mine director and party secretary of the open-pit mine also came down to the pit to check the production of the electric shovels one by one.

    In forty-two minutes, electric shovel No. 95 had already filled a train of coal cars. Electric locomotive driver Li Mingshan started the electric locomotive, pulling 420 tons of coal, breaking through the darkness and heading towards the coal storage yard. When this train of coal cars arrived at the coal storage yard, there were already two trains of coal cars waiting to be unloaded!

    Time passed minute by minute, and dawn was approaching. The cold wind carried faint music and firecracker sounds from afar. In the dispatch room, the staff was constantly directing the electric shovels and vehicles. In the section offices, only one or two people were left; everyone else was down in the pit directing production all night. In the mine pit, trains loaded with coal and rock continuously rushed towards the coal storage yard or the dump site. Production was proceeding safely, and production was proceeding smoothly.

    By 8:00 AM, when the first shift ended, the miners had increased production by a total of 3,063 tons of coal. At that very moment, an extra coal train departed from the West Fuxin Station, heading for Beijing and Tianjin. By noon on the second shift, more than 2,000 tons of coal had been mined. At 3:00 PM, another extra coal train departed from the West Fuxin Station and headed for Shenyang.

    春节假日里矿工生产忙
            新华社记者　赵春烈
    三十夜晚，海州露天煤矿很多工人吃过了晚饭，既没有到俱乐部去跳舞，也没有到街头去看热闹，却穿起工作服，愉快地向矿里走去。晚间七点多钟，在露天矿各段休息室里已经睡满了半夜零点接班的工人，他们要准备精力，打响春节假日增产的第一炮。
    夜晚十一点到了。当矿长用电话向各段段长宣布春节假日增产第一班计划的时候，工人们早已到齐，个个精神饱满，待令出发。在段长向工人传达以前，矿区工会主席、市委和沈阳煤矿管理局、辽宁省工会的领导工作人员赶来向工人祝贺春节和慰问。工人们齐声欢呼着，保证一定完成增产任务。
    时针已经指到十二点，增产的光荣时刻开始了。
    今天人们虽然作着同平常一样的工作，但是心情却有些两样。每个人都在思念着：今天的生产是国务院号召的，是在春节假日里，一定得为工厂、城市生产出更多的煤来。九十五号电铲司机王孝成很快地检查好电铲，“呜”地一声，猛然把电铲开动了起来。在暗淡的灯光下，地下冒出的水气弥漫在电铲的四周。可是，他仍巧妙地、迅速地一勺紧接着一勺把乌黑的煤炭装到了矿车里。“煤，这不就是煤吗！一勺就是三立方公尺，四吨，足够四五口人家烧一年的了。”矿区工会主席和市委工业部的工作人员站在电铲旁边，满意地观察着电铲操作，一面欢笑地谈论着。
    这时，在露天矿坑里，二十多台电铲都在生产。露天矿矿长和党委书记也来到了坑下，一一地检查了电铲生产情况。
    四十二分钟，九十五号电铲已经把一列煤车装完。电车司机李明山开动起电机车，拉着四百二十吨煤，冲破黑暗，奔向储煤仓。当这列煤车到达储煤仓的时候，那里已经停着两列煤车在翻倒了！
    时间一分一分地过去，黎明就要到了。寒风从远处吹来阵阵舞乐声，鞭炮声。调度室里，工作人员一刻不停地指挥着电铲、车辆；各段办公室里，只剩下一两个人，人们都在坑下整夜的指挥生产；在矿坑里，装满煤炭、岩石的列车连续不断地奔向储煤仓或排土场。生产在安全进行着，生产在顺利进行着。
    在清晨八点第一班结束的时候，矿工们共增产了三千零六十三吨煤。就在这一时刻，一列增开的煤车从西阜新车站开出，奔往北京、天津。第二班到中午十二时，又采出了二千多吨煤。在下午三点，从西阜新车站又有一列增开的煤车向沈阳跑去。
