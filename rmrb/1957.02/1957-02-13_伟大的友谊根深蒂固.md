    Great Friendship is Deeply Rooted
    Soviet Journalist Dé Sā Sīlāsīfūskī
    Seven years ago, the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China was re-established with historical documents... However, what I'm thinking about isn't seven years ago, but a distant history that my memory traces back fifty-seven years. I don't need to flip through books or old newspapers. I was a contemporary then. The image of a person emerges in my mind.
    This person was not tall, but he had a fiercely inviolable appearance. He wore a shiny steel helmet, and his beard was particularly striking. This beard was quite famous, growing thick and dense. First, it grew horizontally, dividing his face into two distinct parts, then turned ninety degrees straight upwards to just before his eyes. This type of beard was called a "Kaiser Wilhelm II beard," and he himself was Wilhelm.
    He was addressing soldiers before their departure. He said:
    "Germans! You are going to China. The Yellow Dragon has raised its head in opposition to civilization. It threatens our Christian culture. Show no mercy, but use fire and sword to carve a path to China. You must destroy everything in your path like the Huns of old. Let people call you Attila, leader of the Huns [Note 1]."
    This was Kaiser Wilhelm II's famous "Hunnic Speech." He sent Field Marshal Waldersee [Note 2], the oldest general in the German army, to China to carry out bloody suppression of the Chinese people who were rebelling against European, American, and Japanese colonialism. This German general was tasked with leading the imperialist allied forces. The governments of Britain, France, the United States, Imperial Russia, Japan, Germany, and many other capitalist countries united to attack the Chinese people in order to implement their policies of colonial oppression.
    At that time, the Chinese people bravely and selflessly fought to defend their independence. However, the Chinese people were fighting alone at that time. There was not a single government in the world that was friendly to them. Other oppressed people sympathized with them, but their hearts were willing but their power was weak.
    The imperialists of Europe and the Americas were the masters of the world at that time. Colonialism ruled the entire Asia and Africa. The imperialist bandits fought like dogs over the power to rule the people of various countries. However, when the uprising of the Chinese people shook the foundations of capitalism with its powerful movement, they united.
    The uprising of the Chinese people was a force of thunder and lightning. The ambassadors of the imperialist governments, trapped in the embassy courtyards, were frightened out of their wits. Therefore, these countries hurriedly sent warships and troops from all directions to China.
    The Chinese peasants were poorly armed and poorly organized. They did not have a unified and powerful party that knew the path and methods of making the people's revolution successful. The entire capitalist world was against them. The bourgeois press slandered the Chinese people, portraying them as barbarians who opposed all culture and hated all foreigners. The imperialist press alarmingly shouted that a "crisis of iron" was sweeping from China to the whole world.
    But at this time, a voice exposing imperialist policies was heard in Europe. This voice was full of sympathy for the Chinese people. It was a sound of warm and sincere friendship.
    It was the voice of Lenin.
    Just as a storm of liberation war was sweeping through China, the first issue of "Iskra" was secretly published in Germany. It was the organ of the Russian revolutionary proletariat. Lenin was the soul and leader of this newspaper. The first issue contained two articles written by him. One was called "The Urgent Tasks of Our Movement," which discussed the need to establish a strong and unified Russian proletarian socialist party. The other was called "The War in China," which discussed the heroic struggle of the Chinese people for independence.
    Thus, from the very beginning, two great ideas were merged together, namely: the struggle of all Russian people under the leadership of the revolutionary working class against autocracy and for democracy and socialism was intertwined with the struggle of all countries against colonial oppression.
    The article "The War in China" was written for the Russian people and the advanced Russian workers. It stated: "Currently, the press has launched an attack on the Chinese, clamoring about the savage yellow race, the yellow race's hatred of civilization..." Lenin exposed this lie and the reasons why imperialism launched a "crusade" against China. He wrote: "Now the greedy claws of European capitalists are reaching towards China." (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 4, page 348) Lenin wrote that Russian workers and Chinese workers have a common enemy and common tasks of struggle...
    I am revisiting these words with excitement. This is the root of the great Soviet-Chinese friendship. This is only a nascent, slender root. But it is full of great vitality. A small acorn can grow into a towering oak tree. The unbreakable alliance between the people of the Soviet Union and China, this powerful force in the world, has grown out of the roots of the communist movement.
    Fifty-seven years ago, only a few people had heard of Lenin's articles, and the revolutionary movement of the Chinese peasants was drowned in the blood of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. But everything was not without a price. A spark has formed a prairie fire. The powerful Soviet Union grew from the seeds of communism. The great People's Republic of China arose from the revolutionary war of the Chinese people. The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China is growing, developing, and being consolidated, and has produced brilliant results—the Treaty of Friendship between the two most powerful socialist countries in the world.
    What a great change the face of the world has undergone in half a century! 1900 was the beginning of the twentieth century, and 1950 was the middle of this century. But it seems as if hundreds of years have passed.
    Where is Kaiser Wilhelm II, with his clownish image and ridiculous beard now? Where are the emperors of Russia and China now?
    These emperors have disappeared from the world. The old colonial empires are collapsing.
    However, colonialism still exists. It is still trying to preserve the remnants of its former rule. Today, one can still hear "Hunnic" speeches. They are coming from the United States, which is repeating the old tunes of German militarists.
    The United States does not want to recognize the People's Republic of China. This is like the European monks of the past not recognizing that the Earth revolves around the Sun. But the Earth still revolves according to its own laws, and not according to the instructions of those ignorant monks.
    American imperialists have declared a "policy of strength." They are trying to add new strength to moribund colonialism, and have given it a name called "Eisenhower Doctrine." But can the imperialists reorganize a joint offensive against China in the 1900s style? No, absolutely not. They cannot find partners.
    The Chinese people have long ceased to fight alone. They occupy their rightful place in the socialist camp. All the people who are fighting for independence stand with them.
    Lenin's principle of friendship between the people of all countries is invincible. Our love for the great, talented and hardworking Chinese people is our invaluable treasure. In recent years, we have become more familiar with our eastern neighbor, their life, history, literature and art, young and old. Many Chinese people come to visit our country, and many Soviet people go to visit China. The friendship fixed in the form of documents expresses the sincere and heartfelt love between the people of the two countries. Like many other Soviet people, I can say that the most outstanding chapters in this living book of my life are those that indelibly record the impressions of my acquaintance and friendship with outstanding Chinese figures in China.
    The Soviet-Chinese friendship is great because it reflects the struggle of the two great nations of our time for liberation, for socialism, and for the victory of communism.

### 伟大的友谊根深蒂固

    伟大的友谊根深蒂固
    苏联新闻工作者　德·萨斯拉夫斯基
    七年前，苏中两国人民的友谊以历史性的文件重新固定下来……但是，我想到的不是七年前，记忆使我追溯到五十七年以前的悠久历史。我不需要去翻阅书籍或昔日的报纸。我是当年的同代人。在我的脑海里浮现出一个人的形象。
    这个人身材不高，但是他有一副凶气十足不可侵犯的相貌。他头戴一顶金光闪闪的钢盔，他脸上出奇的是那胡子。这胡子颇有点名气，生得毛茸茸密扎扎的。它先是往横处长，把脸截然分成上下两个部分，然后拐个九十度角一直往上去直到眼睛前面。这种胡子叫做“德皇威廉二世胡”，而他本人就是威廉。
    他在向出发前的士兵们致词。他说：
    “德国人！你们就要到中国去。黄色的龙已经抬起头来在反对文明。它威胁着我们的基督教文化。你们不要留情，要用火和剑打通到中国的道路。你们要像古代的匈奴人一样，毁灭前进途中的一切。让人们把你们称作匈奴的领袖阿齐拉〔注一〕吧。”
    这是凯撒·威廉二世的一次有名的“匈奴式的演讲”。他派了德军最老的一个将领瓦德西元帅〔注二〕到中国去，以便对起义反对欧美和日本殖民主义者的中国人民实行血腥的镇压。这位德国将军担负了领导帝国主义联军的任务。英、法、美、帝俄、日本、德国及其他好多资本主义国家政府，为了实行殖民压迫政策，联合起来向中国人民进攻。
    当时中国人民挺身为保卫自己的独立而进行英勇忘我的斗争。但是，中国人民那时是孤军奋战。在全世界没有一个同他们友好的政府。其他的被压迫人民同情他们，但是心有余而力不足。
    欧美两洲的帝国主义者，是当时主宰全世界的主人。殖民主义统治着整个亚洲和非洲。帝国主义强盗们，为争夺统治各国人民的权力而狗咬狗。但是，当起义的中国人民以其强大的运动震撼着资本主义根基的时候，他们便联合起来了。
    起义的中国人民，是一支雷霆万钧的力量。坐困在使馆院内的帝国主义政府的大使们，吓得胆战心惊。于是这些国家匆匆忙忙地从四面八方派军舰和军队到中国来。
    中国农民的武装很差，组织得很不好。他们没有一个统一而又强大的、熟悉使人民革命成功的道路和方法的党。整个资本主义世界都在反对他们。资产阶级报刊诬蔑中国人民，把他们说成是反对任何文化的野蛮人，说他们仇恨一切外国人。帝国主义者的报刊耸人听闻地叫喊说从中国向全世界袭来一股“铁的危机”。
    可是就在这个时候，在欧洲听到一种揭露帝国主义政策的声音。这声音充满着对中国人民的同情。这是温暖而真挚的友谊之音。
    这是列宁的声音。
    正当中国掀起解放战争的风暴的时候，在德国秘密出版了“火星报”的第一期，这是俄国革命无产阶级的机关报。列宁是这个报纸的灵魂和领导人。第一期上面有他执笔的两篇文章。一篇叫做“我们运动的迫切任务”，论述了建立强大和统一的俄国无产阶级社会主义政党的必要性。另一篇叫做“中国的战争”，论述了中国人民为争取独立而进行的英勇斗争。
    这样，从一开始就把两种伟大的思想融合在一起，这就是：全体俄国人民在革命工人阶级领导下为反对专制、争取民主和社会主义而斗争同各国人民为反对殖民主义压迫而斗争的两种思想交织在一起。
    “中国的战争”一文是写给俄国人民和俄国先进的工人的。文内说道：“目前报刊上掀起了对中国人的讨伐，大声疾呼野蛮的黄种人，黄种人对文明的仇视……”列宁揭穿了这种谎言，揭破了帝国主义发动反对中国的“十字军”的原因。他写道：“现在欧洲资本家贪婪的巨爪伸向中国了。”（列宁全集四卷三四八页）列宁写道，俄国工人和中国工人有着共同的敌人，有着共同的斗争任务……。
    我怀着兴奋的心情重温着这些话。这是伟大苏中友谊的根苗。这只是初生的纤细的根苗。但它富有巨大的生命力。一颗小橡实可以长成参天的橡树。苏中两国人民牢不可破的同盟这支强大的世界力量，是从共产主义运动的根苗中茁长起来的。
    五十七年前，只有少数人听说过列宁的文章，而中国农民的革命运动也在中国人民优秀儿女的血泊中被淹没了。但是，一切都不是没有代价的。星星之火已经形成燎原之势。由共产主义的种籽中成长了强大的苏联。由中国人民的革命战争产生了伟大的中华人民共和国。苏中两国人民的友谊在成长、发展和巩固起来，并且已产生了辉煌的成果——世界上这两个最强大的社会主义国家的友好条约。
    半世纪来世界的面貌起了多么大的变化啊！1900年是二十世纪的开始，1950年是这个世纪的中叶。但看起来，仿佛经历了几百年的时间。
    德皇威廉二世，他那丑角的形象、可笑的胡子而今安在呢？俄国的皇帝、中国的皇帝而今安在呢？
    这些皇帝在世界上绝迹了。老牌的殖民帝国在瓦解中。
    但是，殖民主义还存在着。它还企图保存自己当年统治的余威。今天还可以听到“匈奴式”的演讲。这是从美国发出来的，它在重弹德国军国主义者的老调。
    美国不想承认中华人民共和国。这就像从前欧洲的僧侣不承认地球围绕太阳转一样。但是地球还是按照自己的规律转，而没有按照那些不学无术的僧侣的指令运行。
    美帝国主义者宣布了“实力政策”。他们企图给奄奄待毙的殖民主义增添新的力量，给它起了一个名字叫做“艾森豪威尔主义”。但是，帝国主义者能否再按1900年的版式重整对中国的联合攻势呢？不，绝对办不到。他们找不到伙伴。
    中国人民好久以来就不再是孤军奋战了。他们在社会主义阵营中居于应有的地位。一切为争取独立而斗争的人民都同他们站在一起。
    列宁的各国人民友好的原则百战百胜。我们苏联人对伟大的富有天才和勤劳的中国人民的友爱，是我们的无价之宝。近年来，我们更加熟悉了我们东方的邻国，熟悉了他们的生活、历史、文学和艺术、青年和老人。许多中国人到我们国家来访问，许多苏联人到中国去访问。以文件形式固定下来的友谊，表达了两国人民彼此之间共同的衷心而诚挚的友爱。正如好多其他的苏联人一样，我可以说在我这一部生活的活书中那些最出色的篇章，就是以不可磨灭的字迹写下了我在中国同中国杰出人物相识和友好的印象的那部分。
    苏中友谊之所以伟大，是因为它反映了当代两大民族为争取解放、争取社会主义和共产主义的胜利而进行的斗争。
