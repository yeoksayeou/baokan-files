Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 25th: Workers in the Fushun City Garment Production Cooperatives and Sewing Production Cooperatives have saved more than 115,400 chi (Chinese feet) of cotton cloth for the country since the beginning of the year, equivalent to 5.6% of the cotton cloth allocated to the city's industries this year.

The methods these cooperatives use to save cloth are to improve cutting methods and styles without affecting quality and to fully utilize waste materials for renovation. The Xinmin Garment Cooperative in Wanghua District, when processing labor protection clothing for factories and mines, changed the original lapel to a stand-up collar, concealed buttons to exposed buttons, removed one of the two pockets on the jacket, and removed two of the three pockets on the trousers, and also reasonably nested the large and small pieces when cutting. In this way, each set saved 2 chi and 1 cun (Chinese inches) of cloth compared to the past. Using this method, only six garment cooperatives in Wanghua District, Xin'an District, and others saved more than 59,700 chi of cotton cloth in just over a month. The Fushun City Hat Cooperative improved its cutting method, changing from double-folded cutting to single-layer cutting, and making the lines as thin as possible when cutting, without leaving waste edges. It is estimated that the entire year will save more than 5,000 chi of cotton cloth and materials. Fushun City No. 3 Garment Cooperative recently purchased old labor protection clothing, old flour sacks, waste raincoats, etc., from various factories and mines for renovation, replacing more than 55,600 chi of new cotton cloth.

Recently, the Fushun City Production Cooperative is organizing forces to revise the standards for cotton cloth consumption for various types of clothing, and unify the cloth consumption of various production cooperatives and retail departments, in order to further save cotton cloth.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Beijing's sewing industry has great potential for saving cotton cloth in the mass processing of clothing. By improving cutting alone, clothing production cooperatives and joint state-private clothing factories can save at least 6,000 bolts of cloth this year. This cotton cloth can be used to make 80,000 new garments.

According to recent inspections by relevant departments, Beijing's clothing production cooperative grassroots units use an average of 2 cun more cloth for cutting a single garment and 5 cun more cloth for a cotton garment. The cutting workshop of the Clothing United Cooperative also wastes nearly 1 chi of cloth in every 100 chi. Some joint state-private clothing factories also waste an average of 2 cun to 5 cun of cotton cloth per garment in cutting.

According to the person in charge of the Clothing United Cooperative, the main reason for the waste in cutting is that the cutting workers ideologically neglect saving and cut in the way that is easiest. If the back of the trousers is longer than the front, each garment can save about 1 cun of cloth in mass production if the front and back of the trousers are nested on the whole bolt of cloth. However, some cutting workers, to save trouble, fold a bolt of cloth into many layers according to the length of the back of the trousers and cut the front on one side and the back on the other. The same quality and specification of cloth should be used according to its width in mass production, but some grassroots clothing units are afraid of trouble and do not use cloths of different widths separately, resulting in a large number of very wide, long strips of cloth being left over and sold as waste cloth scraps. In addition, the low technical skills of workers in some units and poor equipment conditions are also reasons for the waste in cutting. Currently, the Clothing United Cooperative is taking measures to solve these problems. Joint state-private clothing factories have formulated plans to save cotton cloth based on inspections.

### 改进剪裁方法节省棉布  抚顺缝纫业两个月来节约棉布十一万公尺  北京服装行业今年至少可节约六千匹布

    改进剪裁方法节省棉布
    抚顺缝纫业两个月来节约棉布十一万公尺
    北京服装行业今年至少可节约六千匹布
    新华社抚顺25日电　抚顺市被服生产合作社和缝纫生产合作社的职工们从年初到现在，为国家节约了十一万五千四百多尺棉布，等于今年国家拨给全市工业用布的5.6％。
    这些合作社节约用布的方法是在不影响质量的前提下，改进裁剪方法和规格式样，并且充分利用废料翻新。望花区新民被服社，在为厂矿加工劳动保护服时，将原来的翻领改为立领，暗扣改为明扣，上衣的两个口袋去掉一个，裤子三个口袋去掉两个，并且把大片小片合理套裁。这样，每套就比过去节省了二尺一寸布。利用这种方法，仅望花区、新安区等六个被服社，在一个多月当中就节约了五万九千七百多尺棉布。抚顺市制帽合作社改进剪裁方法，把过去双折裁帽子改为单层裁，并将裁剪时的划线尽量划细，不下废边，预计全年就能节约棉布和料子五千多尺。抚顺市第三被服社最近收买各厂矿的旧劳动保护服、旧面袋、废雨衣等翻新，代替了五万五千六百多尺新棉布。
    最近，抚顺市生产联社正在组织力量，着手修改各种服装用布量的标准，统一各生产社、门市部的用布量，以便进一步节约棉布。
    新华社22日讯　北京市缝纫业在成批服装加工过程中，节约棉布的潜力很大。仅改进裁剪一项，今年服装生产合作社和公私合营服装厂就至少可以节省六千匹布。这些棉布可作八万件新衣。
    据有关部门最近检查，北京市服装生产合作社基层社裁剪一件单衣，平均多用两寸布，一件棉衣多用五寸布。服装联社裁剪车间每百尺布中差不多也有一尺布是浪费掉的。一些公私合营服装工厂在裁剪中，平均每套衣服也浪费二寸到五寸棉布。
    据服装联社负责人谈，造成裁剪上浪费的主要原因是裁剪工人思想上忽视节约，怎样省事，就怎样裁剪。裤子后身比前身长，在成批生产中，如果在整匹布上利用前后身咬口套裁的方法，每件可省布一寸左右。可是，有些裁剪工人图省事，按照裤子后身的长度，把一匹布折叠成许多层，一边裁前身，另一边裁后身。同一种质量规格的布，在成批生产中，本应按宽度使用，可是有些服装基层社却怕麻烦，不把宽度不同的布分别利用，结果剩下大量很宽的长布条，当废布头出卖。另外，有些单位的工人技术低和设备条件差，也是使裁剪有浪费的原因。现在，服装联社正在采取措施解决这些问题。公私合营服装厂已根据检查，订出节约棉布的计划。
