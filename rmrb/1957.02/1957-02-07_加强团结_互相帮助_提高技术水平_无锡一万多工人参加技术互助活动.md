According to the Xinhua Daily, mass technical assistance activities in factories and enterprises in Wuxi City have greatly developed. Currently, there are 6,744 pairs of sister contracts, brother contracts, and mentor-apprentice contracts signed among workers in the city. The number of participants in this activity has increased more than twofold compared to July of last year, and most contracts are being implemented.

The role of technical assistance in shortening the technical differences between workers is becoming increasingly significant. More than 70% of the workers at Lixin Textile Factory who regularly participate in technical assistance activities have improved their technical skills. The proportion of workers in the factory who can fully complete their production plans increased from 55% of the total number of production workers in the second quarter of last year to 61% in the third quarter, and further increased to 74% in the fourth quarter. Xue Meixiang, an advanced producer in the roving workshop, helped her colleague Gu Guidi learn advanced operating methods such as the "three-guarantee winding," raising Gu Guidi's technical level from second-class to first-class. Subsequently, Gu Guidi helped Pan Suzhen, also raising Pan's technical level from second-class to first-class. Gu Guidi was also named an advanced producer, and Pan Suzhen became a person "who completes their monthly plan well" and was listed on the red bulletin board twice. Technical assistance has also enhanced the unity between workers.

In addition to assistance between workers, some factories have also developed assistance between workers and technicians, and between technicians themselves. For example, after Xu Zhiqin, an engineer in the capital construction section of Lixin Textile Factory, assisted the worker Luo Tongren, Luo Tongren learned simple house design in half a year. Liu Zhikun, the former director of the spinning workshop who graduated from a textile college, and You Bingnan, the deputy director who was promoted from a veteran worker, helped each other, with the former explaining technical theoretical knowledge and the latter explaining practical production experience.

In addition to individual-to-individual assistance, it has also developed into assistance between groups, between workshops, and between factories. After the first workshop and the second workshop of Yuxin Rice Factory signed a mutual assistance contract, the second workshop learned the rice milling operation method from the first workshop; the first workshop learned the experience of sorting by-products from the second workshop. In the mutual assistance between Wuxi Oil Factory and Jiancheng Oil Factory, advanced oil pressing experience was exchanged through observation and "consultation" and other methods, so that the residual oil rate of the dry cake was gradually reduced.

Recently, the Municipal Textile Trade Union and other departments convened a meeting and decided to carry out technical assistance activities more extensively and deeply in the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    加强团结　互相帮助　提高技术水平
    无锡一万多工人参加技术互助活动
    据新华日报讯　无锡市工厂企业中群众性的技术互助活动有很大发展。目前，全市工人中签订的姐妹合同、兄弟合同和师徒合同，共有六千七百四十四对，参加这一活动的人数比去年7月份增加两倍多，而且大部分合同能够执行。
    开展技术互助对缩短工人技术差异的作用愈来愈显著。丽新纺织厂经常参加技术互助活动的工人，70％以上的人技术水平有所提高。该厂能全面完成生产计划的工人，去年第二季度占全厂生产工人总数的55％，第三季度增加到61％，第四季度又增加到74％。该厂粗纱间先进生产者薛梅香帮助同车间女工顾桂娣学习“三包卷”等先进操作法，使顾桂娣的技术水平由第二类提高到第一类；接着，顾桂娣又帮助女工潘素珍，使潘的技术水平也从第二类提高到第一类，顾桂娣也被评为先进生产者，潘素珍也成为“月计划完成好的人”上了两次红榜。通过技术互助还增强了工人之间的团结。
    除工人同工人之间互助外，有些厂还发展到工人同技术人员之间、技术人员同技术人员进行互助。如丽新纺织厂基本建设科工程师许志勤同工人骆同仁互助后，使骆同仁在半年中学会了简单的房屋设计。该厂从纺织专科学校毕业的前纺车间主任刘植昆，和从老工人提拔起来的副主任尤炳南互助时，前者讲技术理论知识，后者讲实际生产经验。
    除个人同个人互助外，并发展到小组同小组、车间同车间、厂同厂之间进行互助。余新米厂第一车间和第二车间签订互助合同后，第二车间学习了第一车间碾米的操作方法；第一车间学习了第二车间整理副产品的经验。无锡油厂和建成油厂互助中通过观摩和“会诊”等方式交流了先进榨油经验，使干饼残油率逐步降低。
    最近，市纺织工会等部门召集会议，决定在增产节约运动中更广泛深入地开展技术互助活动。
