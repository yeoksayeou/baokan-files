    Aden's Exiled Chieftains Determined to Fight Their Way Home
    British Air Force Brutally Bombs and Flattens the Village of Danaba in Aden
    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th – According to a United Press International report from Yemen, chieftains in the “Aden Protectorate” who oppose British rule have declared their determination to fight to drive British forces out of their homeland.

    These chieftains are gathered in the remote, mountainous region of Ibb in Yemen. They claim the support of more than 60,000 tribespeople.

    Chief Kassem Abdul said that last month he and a group of tribal leaders fled to Yemen after his brother was imprisoned by the British after being lured to a meeting. He said, “We must go back and fight.”

    Another chieftain, Saif Hassan Guhaibi, said that the British signed an agreement with his tribe guaranteeing freedom and promising non-interference by British troops. However, the British then engaged in disruptive activities, bribing some chieftains and replacing those who refused to cooperate.

    The youngest chieftain, eighteen-year-old Shari, said that his father had been imprisoned for the past seven years for refusing to obey British orders.

    All the chieftains said that the people support the war of liberation.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th – Aden dispatch: The British Air Force dispatched bombers and jet fighters on the 11th to bomb the village of Danaba in the so-called “Aden Protectorate,” reducing it to rubble.

    The British side openly stated that this was in retaliation for an ambush on a British patrol near the village on February 4th. In that ambush, carried out by local people in resistance to British rule, two British soldiers were killed and six were wounded.

    Four British "Shackleton" bombers dropped a total of ninety-three 500-pound bombs on the village of Danaba, and twelve "Venom" jet fighters fired seventy-two rockets. As a result, all fifteen stone houses in the village were destroyed, with only five remaining as shells. British aircraft bombed and circled over the village for a total of six hours.

    A British statement issued afterwards said: "Observers saw no signs of life."

    亚丁流亡酋长决心打回老家
    英空军在亚丁残暴地炸平了达纳巴村
    新华社12日讯　据合众社记者从也门发出的消息说，“亚丁保护地”反对英国统治的酋长们表示，他们誓死要进行斗争以便把英国军队驱逐出他们的家乡。
    这些酋长们聚集在高山峭壁之中的也门伊卜地方。他们宣称，有六万多部落人民是拥护他们的。
    酋长卡斯姆·阿卜杜勒说，上个月，他同部落中的一批首领逃到了也门，因为他的兄弟在被英国人诱骗去参加一个会议以后被英国人监禁起来了。他说：“我们一定要回去战斗。”
    另一个酋长赛福·哈桑·古哈伊比说，英国人同他签订了一个协定，这个协定给这个部落以自由和保证英国军队不进行干涉。但是，英国人接着就进行捣乱，贿赂了一些酋长，撤换了拒绝同他们合作的酋长。
    一位最年轻的酋长、十八岁的沙里说，他的父亲因为拒绝服从英国的命令，在过去七年间一直被关在牢里。
    所有的酋长都说，人民都是支持解放战争的。
    新华社12日讯　亚丁消息：英国空军在11日出动轰炸机和喷气式战斗机把所谓“亚丁保护地”的达纳巴村炸为平地。
    英国方面公然说，这是为了对英国一支巡逻队2月4日在这个村庄附近被伏击而进行的报复。在当地人民那次为反抗英国统治而进行的伏击中，有两名英军被打死，六人被打伤。
    英国的四架“沙克莱顿”式轰炸机在达纳巴村共投掷了九十三枚五百磅的炸弹，十二架“毒液”式喷气战斗机发射了七十二枚火箭。结果村中原有的十五栋石房子全部被毁，只有五栋还留着躯壳。英国飞机在这个村庄上空共轰击和盘旋了六小时。
    英国当局事后发表的公报说：“观察员没有看到有生物的迹象。”
