    Discussion on the Object of Psychology

    The latest issue of the "New Construction" monthly (February 1957 issue) published an article by Zhang Zhiguang entitled "What Exactly is the Object of Psychology?". In this article, the author criticized Ding Zan's article "Talking about the Object of Psychology" (published in the People's Daily on August 7, 1956) and put forward his own views on this issue.

    The author believes that Ding Zan's assertion that "the higher nervous processes of people who have developed to the psychological level... are the object of psychological research" is not entirely satisfactory. Although psychology and physiology both study phenomena related to higher nervous activity, their objects are different. The author believes that regarding the object of psychology as human higher nervous activity will at least objectively provide an opportunity for all behaviorist psychologists and psychology eliminationists to gain a foothold.

    The author particularly emphasized the importance of studying the problem of individuality and believes that Ding Zan's failure to mention the problem of individuality in his article was not an accidental omission.

    The author wrote that the object of psychology is the laws governing human psychological (consciousness, subjective world) activities as an attribute of the brain reflecting reality.

    In addition, this article also talked about the nature of psychology as a science. The author wrote that psychology belongs to both natural science and social science. It needs brain science, especially Pavlov's physiology of higher nervous activity, as its natural science foundation, and also needs Marxism-Leninism, especially the theory of reflection, as its theoretical foundation. It also wrote that Ding Zan's reason for regarding human higher nervous activity as the object of psychology is due to an excessive emphasis on the relationship between psychology and the brain, and an underestimation of the guiding significance of the theory of reflection in psychology.

    What is the object of psychology? This is a fundamental question in psychology. At present, this issue is being hotly debated in psychological circles at home and abroad and has not yet been resolved. The articles by Ding Zan and Zhang Zhiguang can represent two different views of some Chinese psychological workers on this issue. Regarding recent discussions on this issue, the first issue of the first volume of "Acta Psychologica Sinica" also published four articles by Zhu Zhixian, Zang Yuhai, Pan Shu, and Ye Lin, and the fifth issue of "Philosophical Research" in 1956 also contained an article by Yu Guangyuan.

### 关于心理学对象问题的讨论

    关于心理学对象问题的讨论
    最近出版的一期“新建设”月刊（1957年2月号）上，发表了章志光的“心理学的对象究竟是什么？”一文。在这篇文章中，作者对丁瓒的“谈谈心理学对象的问题”一文（载1956年8月7日人民日报）提出了批评，并对这个问题提出了他自己的看法。
    作者认为，丁瓒主张“在发展到心理水平的人的高级神经过程……也就是心理学的研究对象”，这是不能使人完全满意的。心理学和生理学虽然都研究高级神经活动方面的现象，但是它们的对象并不一样。作者认为，把心理学的对象说成是人的高级神经活动，至少在客观上会使一切行为主义心理学家和心理学取消派等等有可能得到立足的机会。
    作者特别地强调了研究个性问题的重要性，并且认为丁瓒在他的文章中没有谈到个性问题不是一种偶然的忽略。
    作者写道，心理学所研究的对象是作为脑反映现实的一种属性的人的心理（意识、主观世界）活动的规律。
    此外，这篇文章也谈到了关于心理学这门科学的性质问题。作者写道，心理学既属于自然科学，又属于社会科学。它既需要有关脑的科学、特别是巴甫洛夫的高级神经活动生理学作为它的自然科学基础，也需要马克思列宁主义，特别是反映论作为它的理论基础。并且写道，丁瓒之所以把人的高级神经活动当作心理学的对象，是由于过度地强调了心理同脑的关系，是由于过低地估计了反映论在心理学中的指导意义的结果。
    心理学的对象是什么？这是心理学中的一个基本问题。目前，这个问题在国内外心理学界都有热烈的争论，还没有得到解决。丁瓒和章志光的这两篇文章，可以代表我国一部分心理学工作者对这个问题的两种不同看法。最近关于这个问题的讨论，“心理学报”第一卷第一期上还发表了朱智贤、臧玉海、潘菽和叶麐的四篇文章，“哲学研究”1956年第五期上也有一篇于光远的文章。（秋）
