    Egyptian, Syrian, Iranian, Indian, and Burmese Newspapers Comment on Soviet Peace Initiatives
    Soviet Proposals Help Peaceful Resolution of Middle East Issues
    Egypt
    Egyptian newspapers "Al-Shaab", "Al-Masaa", "Al-Qahira", "Al-Akhbar," and "Al-Misri" have all published articles commenting on the Soviet proposals for guaranteeing peace in the Near and Middle East.
    Husseni Fahmy, editor-in-chief of "Al-Shaab," wrote that while US Secretary of State Dulles supported Israel's aggressive intentions, Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov proposed solving the Near and Middle East problem based on respect for the sovereignty of the countries in the region and considering the will of the people of these countries. The author wrote: "The Soviet proposal that there should be no interference in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries touches on one of the most important problems existing in this region. The Soviet proposal that countries in this region should not be dragged into foreign military alliances at all can free this entire region from many of the difficulties it is currently encountering, difficulties which have arisen because Western countries have exerted political, economic, and military pressure on the people of this region to force these countries to participate in military agreements. Conspiracies, political maneuvers, and various forms of pressure against the Arab peoples, coercing them to participate in military treaties, are the main reasons for the current tense situation in this region.
    "Al-Misri" wrote in an editorial that the principles stipulated in the Soviet proposal to Western countries "completely conform to the wishes of the people of the Arab countries." The newspaper wrote: "If the Soviet proposals are accepted by Britain, the United States, and France, it will be of great benefit to the Arab countries."
    Syria
    According to the Syrian newspaper "Al Ayam," Syrian political figures are deeply satisfied with Shepilov's proposal to guarantee peace in the Middle East because the spirit of this proposal fully conforms to the liberation policies of the Arab countries and the main principles established at the Bandung Conference.
    Iran
    The Iranian "Ettela'at," "Jahan," and other newspapers published summaries of Shepilov's report on the front page with large headlines. The newspapers pointed out the statement in the report that the visit of the Iranian King and the Iranian parliamentary delegation to the Soviet Union, as well as the warm reception of the Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation in Iran, proves that it is possible to further develop relations between the Soviet Union and Iran in a spirit of friendship and mutual understanding.
    India
    The Indian Hindi daily "Nava Bharat Times" published an editorial welcoming the Soviet proposals on guaranteeing peace in the Middle East, stating: "Even if Western countries do not welcome this proposal, the Asian world will sincerely welcome it."
    The newspaper stated that the Soviet plan is basically based on the principles, ideals, and policies pursued by India and other peace-loving countries and is in line with the ten principles of the Bandung Conference.
    The Urdu daily "Inquilab" said: "For many years, there has never been a better and more practically feasible proposal for establishing true peace in the world." The newspaper warned: "If the United States does not agree to this proposal, then the responsibility for the deteriorating situation in West Asia will be borne by the United States, not by the Soviet Union."
    "National Herald" believes that the Soviet plan "helps to clarify thinking because it presents a clear choice to the Arabs and the world." It said that this choice is "either peaceful freedom or the threat of military entanglement, of which the Eisenhower Plan is a typical example."
    The newspaper also said: "There will be no stable solution in West Asia without Soviet participation." It said that if the United States truly desires peace, then "Eisenhowerism and the Baghdad Pact must be abolished, otherwise it will mean that the United States is prepared to sacrifice peace for the sake of military treaties."
    Burma
    The English-language newspaper "The Burma Times" in Rangoon said in an editorial on the 14th that the Soviet Union's six-point peace proposal on the Middle East issue is beneficial and very good, "and anyone who sincerely desires peace has no reason to oppose the implementation of these proposals."
    The editorial said that the Soviet peace proposals should be given the opportunity to prove their worth.

    埃叙伊印缅等国报纸评苏联和平倡议
    苏联建议有助于和平解决中东问题
    埃及
    埃及“人民报”、“晚报”、“开罗报”、“消息报”和“埃及报”都刊载文章评论苏联提出的关于保障中近东和平的建议。
    “人民报”主编侯赛尼·法米写道，当美国国务卿杜勒斯支持以色列的侵略企图的时候，苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫提出了在尊重这一地区的国家主权和考虑到这些国家的人民的意志的基础上解决中近东问题的建议。作者写道：“苏联提出的、不得对中东各国内政有任何干涉的建议，接触到了这一地区存在的最重要问题之一。苏联建议，一概不得把这一地区的国家拖进外国军事同盟，这就可以使这整个地区解脱它目前所遇到的许多困难，这些困难是由于西方国家为强迫这一地区的国家参加军事协定而对这个地区人民施加政治、经济和军事压力而产生的。用阴谋、政治手腕和各种形式的压力来对付阿拉伯各国人民，胁迫他们参加军事条约，这就是目前这一地区呈现紧张局面的主要原因。
    “埃及报”在社论中写道，苏联对西方国家提出的建议中所规定的原则，“完全符合阿拉伯国家各国人民的愿望”。这家报纸写道：“如果苏联的建议被英国、美国和法国所接受，对阿拉伯国家就会有很大的好处。”
     叙利亚
    据叙利亚“旷野报”报道，叙利亚政界人士对谢皮洛夫提出的关于保证中东和平的建议深感满意，因为这个建议的精神完全符合阿拉伯国家的解放政策和万隆会议所确立的主要原则。
    伊朗
    伊朗“知识报”、“世界报”和其他报纸以大字标题在第一版上刊登了谢皮洛夫的报告的摘要。各报指出了报告中的这个说法：伊朗国王、伊朗议会代表团到苏联的访问以及苏联最高苏维埃代表团在伊朗受到殷勤款待的情况，证明有可能本着友爱和互相谅解的精神进一步发展苏联和伊朗之间的关系。
    印度
    印度印地文日报“新印度时报”发表社论欢迎苏联关于保障中东和平的建议，它说：“即使西方国家不欢迎这个建议，亚洲世界也会真诚地欢迎它。”
    这家报纸说，苏联的计划基本上是以印度和其他和平国家所奉行的原则、理想和政策为基础的，而且是符合万隆会议的十项原则的。
    乌尔都文日报“团结报”说：“过去许多年以来，对于在世界上建立真正的和平问题，从没有提出过比这更好和更实际可行的建议了。”这家报纸警告说：“如果美国不同意这项建议，那么西亚局势恶化的责任将要由美国担负，而不是由苏联担负。”
    “国民先驱报”认为，苏联的计划“有助于澄清思想，因为它把明确的选择摆在阿拉伯人和全世界面前。”它说，这种选择是“要有和平的自由呢，还是要军事纠缠的威胁，艾森豪威尔计划就是这种威胁的一个典型”。
    这家报纸还说：“如果没有苏联参加，西亚就不会有稳定的解决。”它说，如果美国真正希望和平，那么“就必须取消艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约，否则那将意味着美国准备为了军事条约而牺牲和平。”
    缅甸
    仰光的英文报纸“缅甸人报”14日在社论中说，苏联关于中东问题的六点和平建议是有益的、非常好的，“任何人如果真诚希望和平的话，都没有理由反对实施这些建议。”
    社论说，应当使苏联的和平建议有机会来证明它的价值。
