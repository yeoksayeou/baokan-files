Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd - Urban construction has progressed rapidly in the first four years of our country's First Five-Year Plan. Many ancient cities have become young and prosperous, and the unreasonable conditions left over from the old society are being changed.

China's first iron and steel base, Anshan, has developed into one of the largest iron and steel cities in the Far East. Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Baotou, Luoyang, Hankou and other places in China's interior are being built into new industrial cities. In these places, where there was little or no industry in the past, new iron and steel complexes, huge oil refineries, heavy machinery plants, and power stations, as well as textile and sugar factories, have either been completed or are under construction. The populations of these cities have increased significantly, and industrial production is also constantly rising.

According to available data from the State Statistical Bureau, a total of over 100 million square meters of housing and other civilian buildings have been built in cities or industrial and mining areas across the country during the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan. In many cities in coastal areas or inland, new streets with rows of tall buildings are being built simultaneously. In the suburbs of many cities, alongside the dense clusters of low-walled, thatched houses where workers used to live, beautiful workers' residential areas like "Caoyang New Village" in Shanghai and "Taiping Village" in Anshan have emerged. These residences have relatively convenient facilities, and the residential areas have shops, public canteens, cinemas, and clubs that serve the workers and their families. According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments, more than 170 cinemas and over 70 theaters were built in our country during the first four years.

In these four years, the state has allocated more than 1 billion yuan to build urban public utilities. A total of 38 water plants were built across the country, and more than 2,000 kilometers of water pipes were laid. Eleven cities that previously had no running water now have it. The number of people using tap water nationwide has increased by more than 8 million. Xi'an, a famous historical city in China, has replaced the bitter water it has consumed since ancient times with tap water. In Lanzhou, an ancient city on the banks of the Yellow River, people have been drinking muddy Yellow River water for generations. Regardless of the hot summer or cold winter, or whether it was windy, rainy or muddy, people had to go to the Yellow River to carry the water back by shoulder or cart. Last year, Lanzhou had temporary tap water, and the situation in which citizens had to perform heavy physical labor to get water began to change; a modern water plant will also be put into production this year. Dezhou, which has always consumed canal water, Hefei, which consumes salty water, and the county town of Huadian in Jilin, where people suffer from "Kaschin–Beck disease" due to toxic water, have also gained access to tap water one after another.

In the past four years, a total of 2,000 kilometers of sewers have been built across the country. Fifteen cities that previously had no sewers have built sewers. Many stinky ditches like "Dragon Beard Ditch" have been dredged or filled. Large-scale work has also been carried out to green the cities. These constructions and mass sanitation campaigns have greatly improved the sanitation of our cities.

Urban public transportation has also greatly developed in the first four years. The 52 cities across the country that now have buses and trams have added more than 1,500 buses and more than 200 trams. Lanzhou and other cities have also built ring railways.

Many cities have opened up new roads and repaired old ones. The length of asphalt, gravel, or concrete roads that have been built alone totals 3,600 kilometers. Cities like Beijing have also improved the transportation conditions for suburban farmers and residents in small alleys.

The scale of urban construction in these years is unprecedented in the history of our country. However, due to the rapid growth of the urban population, urban housing and public utilities still cannot meet the needs of the people. This situation will be difficult to change in the short term. The reporter learned from the State Construction Commission and the Ministry of Urban Construction that in recent years, some existing cities have been planned too large, and there have been attempts to realize long-term plans within a few years; newly built industrial cities also have a tendency to be too idealistic and overly pursue the form of "socialist cities."

The type layout of existing cities, etc., are inseparable from the level of social production and social nature of each historical period. To change some of the unreasonable conditions in these cities, construction must be based on the existing foundation, or, if building a completely new city, one must also not deviate from the current backward economic level and other social conditions of our country, or the specific conditions of the local area. Therefore, in urban planning or urban construction work, those practices of seeking bigness and novelty, and attempting to build beautiful "socialist cities" according to long-term planning maps in a short period of time, are all unrealistic. Continuing to correct or prevent this tendency of formalism and subjectivism will enable our country's urban construction to achieve greater success.

### 在第一个五年计划的前四年中  城市建设事业有很大发展  纠正或防止求大求新、过于追求“社会主义城市”形式的倾向，将会获得更大成绩

    在第一个五年计划的前四年中
    城市建设事业有很大发展
    纠正或防止求大求新、过于追求“社会主义城市”形式的倾向，将会获得更大成绩
    据新华社3日讯　在我国第一个五年计划前四年中，新工业城市的建设进展很快，许多古老的都市变得年青而繁荣，旧社会遗留下的不合理的状况正在改观。
    我国第一个钢铁基地鞍山，已经发展成远东最大的钢铁城市之一。我国内地的太原、西安、兰州、包头、洛阳、汉口等地，正在建成新的工业城市。这些过去几乎没有工业或工业不多的地方，新的钢铁联合企业，巨大的炼油厂，重型机械厂和发电站，以及纺织和制糖等工厂，有的已经建成，有的正在建设。这些城市的人口，增加了很多，工业生产也在不断上升。
    根据国家统计局的现有资料，全国的城市或工矿区，第一个五年计划前四年共建设了一亿多平方公尺的住宅及其它民用建筑。在近海区或内地的不少城市，楼房栉比的新街，齐建并起。在不少城市的郊外，在过去工人住的矮墙低屋茅舍密集的一旁，出现了像上海的“曹杨新村”和鞍山的“太平村”等一样漂亮的工人住宅区。这些住宅内有比较方便的设置，住宅区有为职工及其家属们服务的商店、公共食堂、电影院和俱乐部等。据有关部门不完全的统计，前四年期间，我国共建设了一百七十多个电影院，七十多个剧场。
    这四年，国家共拨出了十亿多元资金来建设城市公用事业。全国总共建设了三十八个自来水厂，铺设了两千多公里长的自来水管线。十一个从前没有自来水的城市，现在有了自来水。全国用自来水的人数增加了八百多万。我国历史名城西安，自古以来食用的苦水已经被自来水代替。黄河之畔的古城兰州，世世代代，人民都是食用混浊的黄河河水，不论炎夏寒冬，不管风雨泥泞，人们也得去到黄河边上，用肩担车拉的方法，运回河水。去年，兰州有了临时的自来水，市民吃水成为笨重的体力劳动的情况开始变了；现代化的自来水厂今年也将投入生产。历来食用运河河水的德州，食用咸水的合肥，因食用水含毒而生“大骨节症”的吉林桦甸县城，也先后有了自来水用。
    在过去的四年，全国修建的下水道，共有两千公里长。十五个原来没有下水道的城市修建了下水道。许多像“龙须沟”那样的臭水沟被疏浚或填平。城市的绿化也进行了大规模的工作。这些建设和群众性的卫生运动，使我国的城市卫生有了很大的改善。
    城市的公共交通事业，前四年也有很大发展。全国现在五十二个有公共汽车和电车的城市，共增加了一千五百多辆汽车，二百多辆电车。兰州等城市还修建了环行铁路。
    许多城市，开拓了新路，修整了旧道，只是修建的柏油路、石子路、或混凝土路，就有三千六百多公里。北京等城市，还改善了郊区农民和小巷内居民的交通条件。
    这几年城市建设规模之大，是我国历史上从未有过的。但是，由于城市人口增长太快，城市的住宅或公用事业仍然不能满足人民的需要。这种情况，在今后短时期内，还难改变。记者从国家建设委员会和城市建设部获悉，近年来，有些原有的城市，规划的过大，并且企图将长期规划在几年之内实现；新建的工业城市，也有过于理想化，过于追求“社会主义城市”形式的倾向。
    原有城市的类型布局等等，是同历史上每一时期的社会生产水平和社会性质分不开的，要改变这些城市某些不合理的状况，要在原有的基础上建设，或者完全新建一个城市，同样，也不能脱离我国当前落后的经济水平等社会现状和本地的具体条件。因此，在城市规划或城市建设工作中，那种求大求新，企图在短期内，按着远景规划图建成美丽的“社会主义城市”的做法，都是不实际的。继续纠正或防止这种形式主义和主观主义的倾向，将会使我国的城市建设，获得更大的成绩。
