Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 14th: A recent article in the Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" pointed out that there is currently a certain degree of demoralization among party members. Many party members have lost confidence in their own strength. As a result, in some enterprises, party organizations have to work almost illegally. In other places, especially in government offices, there are many careerists who want to worm their way into the Party. In addition to this situation, disputes have arisen among party members, and if we use words like "counter-revolutionary" and "sectarianism" to accuse each other, it will not help the purity of the Party.

The article went on to point out that we must remove bad elements from the Party, but we must do everything possible to avoid adopting the old, harmful cadre policies, which presumed everyone was guilty. Another important issue in the struggle to maintain the purity of the Party is the Party's regular leadership. The Party's Provisional Central Committee passed a resolution in early December last year that discussed several important issues concerning Party building and proposed some measures to strengthen democratic life within the Party. The implementation of all these measures should be for the purpose of truly strengthening internal democracy.

The article said that although the activities of counter-revolutionary elements have decreased, such activities are still not to be ignored. Communists must do their utmost to overcome difficulties.

    匈“人民自由报”谈党的纯洁性问题
    新华社布达佩斯14日电　“人民自由报”最近发表的一篇文章指出，目前在党员们当中有一定程度的颓丧情绪。有不少党员对自己的力量丧失信心。因此在一些企业中，党组织几乎得在非法的情况下进行工作。在另外的一些地方，特别是在机关里，有不少野心家想钻进党。除了这种情况以外，在党员们当中发生了争执，如果我们用像“反革命”和“宗派主义”这一类的字眼互相责骂，对于党的纯洁性将不会有什么帮助的。
    文章接着指出，我们必须把坏分子清除出党，可是我们必须用一切办法来避免采取旧的有害的干部政策，这个政策认为一切人都有罪。另一个关于争取党的纯洁性的斗争的重要问题是党的正规领导。党的临时中央委员会在去年12月初通过的决议论述了关于党的建设的几个重要问题，提出了一些加强党内民主生活的措施。实行这一切措施都应当是为了真正地加强内部民主。
    文章说，虽然反革命分子的活动是减少了，然而这种活动仍然是不可忽视的。共产党人必须尽最大的力量来克服困难。
