Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 6th. Preparations for the construction of China's largest thermal power plant, the Liaoning Power Plant, are actively underway. Construction of the main plant building will commence this year, and installation of some power generation equipment will begin next year.

The total capacity of the power plant's generating equipment will be several hundred thousand kilowatts, and it will be built in two phases. The first phase of the project will be completed by 1960. Once the entire power plant is completed, the industrial sector of Northeast China will receive a massive supply of electricity from it.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, although the power generation capacity of Northeast China has already increased significantly, the rapid development of other sectors of the national economy has led to a substantial increase in electricity demand, and therefore the power supply remains tight. Therefore, the state has decided to construct the Liaoning Power Plant while expanding and constructing seven other power plants in Fushun, Fuxin, Jilin, and Dalian in Northeast China. Now, the project plan for this power plant has been approved by the State Council, agreeing to include this project in the First Five-Year Plan in order to start construction quickly.

The complete set of generating equipment for the Liaoning Power Plant will be supplied by the German Democratic Republic; the design and construction will also be guided by experts from the German Democratic Republic.

In order to accelerate the construction of the Liaoning Power Plant, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry has decided to allocate several thousand tons of steel this year, so that the construction of the main plant building can begin as soon as possible.

    我国最大的火力发电站将在辽宁省兴建
    新华社沈阳6日电　我国最大的火力发电站——辽宁电站，正在积极进行建厂的筹备工作。电站的主厂房工程将在今年动工兴建，明年就要开始部分发电设备的安装工作。
    这个电站发电设备的总容量共有几十万瓩，将分两期建设。第一期工程，将在1960年内建成。这个电站全部建成以后，东北地区工业就将从这里得到巨大的电力供应。
    在第一个五年计划期间，东北地区虽然已经增加大量的发电能力，但是由于其他国民经济部门发展迅速，需要的电力显著增加，因此电力供应仍然很紧张。所以国家决定在东北扩建、新建抚顺、阜新、吉林、大连等七个电站的同时，建设辽宁电站。现在，这个电站的计划任务书，已经国务院批准，同意将这项工程列入第一个五年计划，以便迅速开工建设。
    辽宁电站的成套发电设备将由德意志民主共和国供应；设计和施工也将由德意志民主共和国的专家指导进行。
    为了加速辽宁电站的建设，电力工业部决定今年拨给钢材数千吨，使主厂房工程及早地开始建设。
