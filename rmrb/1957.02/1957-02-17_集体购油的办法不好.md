    The collective oil purchasing method is not good
    Last summer, the Grain Bureau of Shaanxi Province and the Shaanxi Provincial Oil Company stipulated that agricultural cooperative members must collectively purchase cooking oil in units of agricultural cooperatives or natural villages; and that oil must be purchased once a month, all at once. After this method was issued, some district and county party and government organs disagreed, and many county oil companies did not implement it. Later, the Grain Bureau and the Oil Company decided to change to collective oil purchases by five to fifteen households; many places still felt that this method was inconvenient for the masses and difficult to implement; in a few places where it had been implemented (such as Wugong, Longxian, etc.), it caused dissatisfaction among the masses. They said, "Before buying oil, several families have to pool their money together, and after the oil is bought, it has to be divided. If the money is not collected, the oil cannot be bought. Those without money certainly cannot eat oil, and those with money cannot eat oil either; there are losses in dividing the oil, and only we suffer."
    Why are the Grain Bureau of Shaanxi Province and the Oil Company insisting on adopting the collective oil purchase method that is not welcomed by the peasants? It is said that it is because they want to "get rid of" the relationship with the supply and marketing cooperatives in terms of agency purchase, agency sales, and agency processing, in order to save the expenses of the oil company. After the agency sales relationship with the supply and marketing cooperatives was cancelled, the number of supply points of the oil company was greatly reduced, and they were afraid that they would be too busy, so they stipulated the collective oil purchase method. What kind of economizing view is this?
    It is suggested that they immediately change this practice so that the masses can buy oil conveniently.

### 集体购油的办法不好

    集体购油的办法不好
    陕西省粮食厅和陕西省油脂公司在去年夏天规定，农业社社员必须以农业社或自然村为单位集体购买食油；并且规定每月购油一次，一次购完。这个办法下达以后，有些专区和县的党政机关不同意，许多县的油脂公司也没执行。后来粮食厅和油脂公司又决定改为五户到十五户集体购油；许多地方仍然感到这个办法对群众不方便，难以执行；少数已经执行的地方（如武功、陇县等地），引起了群众的不满。他们说：“买油前要几家把钱凑在一起，油买来后又要分。钱凑不齐，油买不成，没钱的固然吃不上油，有钱的也吃不上油；分油有耗蚀，只有自己吃亏。”
    为什么陕西省粮食厅和油脂公司硬要采取不受农民欢迎的集体购油办法呢？据说是因为他们要“摆脱”同供销社的代购、代销、代加工等关系，以节省油脂公司的费用。取消了供销社的代销关系以后，油脂公司的供应点减少了很多，他们怕工作忙不过来，就规定了集体购油的办法。这是什么节约观点呢？
    建议他们马上改变这种作法，使群众能够很方便地买到油。
