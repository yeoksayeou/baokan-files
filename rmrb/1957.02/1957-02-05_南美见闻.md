Glimpses of South America	Zhao Feng

Almost every tourist booklet praises the unique beauty of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: "Extraordinarily green sea, tropical skies, mountains rising abruptly on the coast next to long, calm beaches, exuberant colors, magical natural scenery, passionate city... this is Rio de Janeiro."

While the booklets are attractively written, they fail to adequately describe Rio de Janeiro's beauty. Indeed, it's difficult. In my view, Rio de Janeiro's beauty lies in its mountains and beaches. The towering peaks resemble giant reefs at sea, yet right next to these peaks, there are no more rocks—beyond the "Sugarloaf" mountain, there stretch kilometers of flat, tranquil, white sandy beaches. Along the beaches are wide roads, and behind the roads stand hundreds or thousands of buildings of over ten or twenty stories. It must be said, this is a magnificent sight.

Thanks to the enthusiasm of a Brazilian friend, we took a full-day tour of Rio de Janeiro during a free day. I won't dwell on the experience of riding the cable car to ascend the four-hundred-meter-high "Sugarloaf" mountain that juts out from the coast, although the experience of the suspended cable car swaying slightly in the high altitude, with white clouds floating past the window, was quite interesting. The botanical gardens near the beautiful mountain are also filled with exotic flowers and plants. And it was also interesting to visit the pavilion on the mountain called "Chinese View," overlooking the mountains surrounding Rio de Janeiro, and discussing this amusing structure, built with reinforced concrete to imitate bamboo, resembling both a pavilion and a tower. However, the most interesting part was the opportunity to see the lives of ordinary citizens in this bustling South American city.

A half-hour drive out of the city center revealed an area of shacks. This, we were told, was the "ordinary citizens' residential area." Yet even this simple wooden house required one-third of a worker's monthly salary (one-third of over three thousand Cruzeiros) for rent. We saw a young man pushing a large, barrel-like wooden container on the scorching road. We learned that these wooden houses generally lacked running water, so people had to haul water from a distant source. On the way back, however, my Brazilian friend told us that this was not the poorest area, because there was still a bus service to the city. The worst was the residents living on the small mountains near the city center. There was no drinking water on the mountains, and every bucket of water had to be carried up by hand from the foot of the mountain. Furthermore, there was no transportation on the mountains, so they had to run up and down every day to get to and from work.

In the evening, we passed the famous "Two Brothers" mountain, the most famous beach in the suburbs. Here, the scene was vastly different from the "ordinary citizens' residential area." Stylish cars lined the beach, filled with wealthy people enjoying their holidays. The food stalls in the small town were also quite charming: the top of a large coconut was sawn off, and a paper tube was used to drink the fresh coconut juice; on the charcoal fire, old corn was cooked until the kernels burst open; chunks of beef skewered on long bamboo sticks were grilled half-cooked over the charcoal fire, dipped in some garlic juice and chili oil, and sprinkled with a layer of coconut flour. Such an authentic Brazilian meal, enough to fill five or six people, cost no more than the price of two aperitifs in a large hotel in the city.

It was late when we returned to the hotel, and another friend who had visited China pulled us into a restaurant. There, a small house was decorated to resemble a rural fisherman's wooden hut, with fishing nets hanging on the walls. The food was all fish and coconut. For example, fish cooked in coconut oil was called "Pimenta," which was fresh and delicious; and the sweet sauce made with coconut meat was called "Hutapa," which had a honey-like flavor. But the most interesting thing was that this restaurant, from its decoration to its cuisine, was completely authentic to the northern Brazilian style, and the musicians singing were performing pure northern Brazilian folk songs. Like all the singers in the bars, their throats were always hoarse, but the flavor was very rich. It was not until two o'clock after midnight that the hosts remembered that we had a performance the next day, and they agreed to let us leave this interesting restaurant called "Fang Tou."

    南美见闻	赵沨
    几乎每一本导游的小册子都赞美巴西的里约热内卢的特殊的美丽：“绿得出奇的海，热带的天空，在海岸上突然矗立的山峰紧临着漫长的平静的沙滩，奔放的色彩，神奇的大自然景色，热情的城市……这就是里约热内卢”。
    小册子写的虽然很富有吸引力，但也没有把里约热内卢的美丽恰当地形容和描写出来。的确，这是很困难的。依我看，里约热内卢的美丽在于它的山和沙滩。突起的山峰好像海上的巨礁，而就在这突起的山峰旁边，却又再也没有旁的山石了——越过这称为“甜面包”的山峰，立刻就是十几公里长的平坦、安静的白色的沙滩。海滩上是宽阔的马路，马路后边，便是成百上千座的十多层、二十多层的大楼房。应该说，这是很壮观的景色。
    感谢一位巴西朋友的热心，趁着有一日的闲暇，带领我们作里约热内卢的竟日游。我不想多说坐缆车爬上四百公尺的海岸上突起的“甜面包”山的情景，虽然这架空高悬的缆车在高空微微颠动，看着白云就在窗口飘浮，也算很有趣的经历。而美景山畔的植物园更是一片奇花异草。再到山上被称为“中国美景”的亭子上眺望围绕着里约热内卢的群山，谈论着这用钢骨水泥模仿竹子的样子搭起的又像亭又像阁的有趣的建筑，也是很有兴味的事。但是，最有兴趣的还是我们借此机会看了一下这个繁华的南美大城市的普通市民的生活。
    汽车开出市区半小时，就看到了一片木棚式的家屋。据说，这就是“普通市民住宅区”。但就是这种简陋的一间木屋，每月租金也要用去一个工人的月薪的三分之一（三千多克鲁赛罗的三分之一）。我们看到在烈日炎炎的马路上，一个年轻人推着一个酒桶似的大木桶。经过解释才知道，这种木屋一般没有自来水管，人们只好从很远的地方推水来使用。但在归途中，同行的巴西朋友告诉我们，这还不是最贫穷的区域，因为这里还有公共汽车通到城里去。最糟的是住在市区附近小山上的居民，山上没有饮水，每一桶水都要从山脚下用手提上山去，而山上更没有交通工具，每天上工下工都要跑上跑下。
    傍晚，我们经过那著名的“两兄弟”山，这是郊外最有名的海滩。在这里，已经和“普通市民住宅区”大异其趣，时式的汽车，海滩上是欢度假日的有钱人。小镇上的食品摊也是别有风趣的：用锯子把一个大椰子的上端锯开，用一个纸管来喝些新鲜的椰汁；炭火上，老玉米被煮得粒粒开花；用长竹签串着一块块的牛肉也就在炭火上烤个半熟，醮上一些蒜汁和辣椒油再撒上一层椰肉粉，这么一顿道地的巴西饭，五六个人饱吃一顿，用的钱也不过合城里大旅馆里喝两杯开胃酒的价钱。
    回到旅馆已经很晚，又被另一位访问过中国的朋友拉到一个饭馆里。那里，一栋小房子布置成农村渔人木屋的样子，墙上还挂着渔网，吃的东西全是鱼和椰子。比如用椰子油煮的鱼叫“皮门特”，鲜美可口；用椰子肉作的甜酱叫“互塔帕”很有蜂蜜的味道。但最有兴味的是这个从装饰到菜肴完全是地道的巴西北部风格的饭店，卖唱的音乐家演唱的也是纯粹的巴西北部民谣。正像所有的酒店卖唱者一样，他们的喉咙总是沙哑的，但韵味很浓厚。直到午夜后的两点钟了，主人们想起明天我们还有演出，才同意我们告辞，离开了这个叫做“方头”的有趣的饭店。　（未完）（附图片）
