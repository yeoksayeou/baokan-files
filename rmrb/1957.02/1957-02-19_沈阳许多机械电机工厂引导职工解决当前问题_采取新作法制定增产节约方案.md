Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 18th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Gu Tiefeng report): Since the Spring Festival, many state-owned mechanical and electrical manufacturing factories in Shenyang have successively formulated measures and plans for increasing production and practicing economy this year. More than ten factories, including Shenyang Transformer Factory, Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory, and Shenyang Fan Factory, have already mobilized employees to discuss this year's measures and plans.

At the beginning of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the mechanical and electrical factories in Shenyang mobilized office personnel to tap potential and formulate measures and plans for increasing production and practicing economy this year. Then, they mobilized all employees to discuss them, changing the previous practice of discussing targets first and then discussing measures. This approach was adopted based on the current shortage of steel materials, the fact that the state plan has not yet been issued, and after summarizing the experiences and lessons of previous years. In the past, targets were discussed first, and if the targets were too high, employees had no measures and lacked confidence in completing the targets; if the targets were too low, employees would not actively tap potential but could still exceed the targets. This new approach plays a significant role in guiding employees to actively solve the current key problems in production.

In response to the current serious difficulties of steel shortage, various mechanical and electrical factories have taken many measures. They actively started with modifying the design and production technology of each product, changing the phenomena of excessively thick, coarse, and large product parts, or eliminating redundant parts, to save steel materials. For example, the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory mobilized designers to review and modify the designs of various old products. By modifying the structural design of only one type of 300-horsepower air compressor, the weight of each unit was reduced by 2.1 tons. In this way, the steel materials previously needed to produce three compressors can now be used to manufacture almost four compressors, and the performance of the products can be greatly improved. The Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory modified thirteen places on the design drawings of a disc feeder, saving 165 kilograms of steel per feeder.

Some mechanical and electrical factories in Shenyang have also adopted many measures to reduce the rejection rate, reduce tool consumption, maintain equipment, etc., according to the characteristics of their factories.

At present, some mechanical and electrical factories only pay attention to overcoming the difficulty of steel shortage, and not enough attention is paid to measures to tap the potential in other aspects. In January of this year, the rejection rate of nine machinery factories still showed an upward trend. These issues still need to be further resolved.

### 沈阳许多机械电机工厂引导职工解决当前问题  采取新作法制定增产节约方案

    沈阳许多机械电机工厂引导职工解决当前问题
    采取新作法制定增产节约方案
    据新华社沈阳18日电　新华社记者顾铁风报道：沈阳许多国营机械、电机制造工厂春节以来先后订出今年增产节约的措施方案。沈阳变压器厂、沈阳矿山机器厂、沈阳低压开关厂、沈阳扇风机厂等十多个工厂，已经发动职工讨论今年的措施方案。
    沈阳机械、电机工厂在增产节约运动一开始，就发动科室人员挖掘潜力，拟定今年的增产节约措施方案，然后发动全体职工进行讨论，改变了往年先讨论指标，后讨论措施的作法。这是根据今年钢铁材料不足、国家计划尚未下达和在总结往年经验教训以后所采取的作法。往年，首先讨论指标，如果指标过高，职工们没有措施，缺乏完成指标的信心；如果指标过低，职工们不积极挖潜力，也能超过指标。这种新作法，对引导职工积极解决当前生产关键问题有很大作用。
    各机械、电机工厂针对当前钢材不足的严重困难，采取了很多措施。他们积极从修改每台产品设计、生产工艺着手，改变产品部件过厚、过粗、过大等现象，或者取消多余的部件，来节约钢铁材料。如沈阳空气压缩机厂发动设计人员审查和修改各种老产品的设计，仅仅修改一种三百马力空气压缩机的结构设计，每台重量减轻二点一吨，这样，过去生产三台压缩机所需的钢材，现在差不多就可以制造出四台压缩机，并且能使产品性能大大提高。沈阳矿山机器厂在一台圆盘给料机的设计图纸上，修改了十三处，每台给料机就可以节约钢材一百六十五公斤。
    沈阳有些机械、电机工厂还根据本厂的特点，采取了许多降低废品率、减少工具损耗、维护设备等等增产节约的措施。
    目前，有些机械、电机工厂只注意克服钢材不足的困难，对挖掘其他方面潜力的措施注意还很不够。今年1月份，九个机械工厂的废品率还有上升的趋势。这些问题还待进一步解决。
