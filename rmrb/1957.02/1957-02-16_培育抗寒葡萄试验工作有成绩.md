Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The experimental work on cultivating new cold-resistant grape varieties for winemaking has achieved preliminary success. On February 12th, at an academic paper discussion meeting at the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, botanists Shen Jun and others presented two papers on cold-resistant grape research.

This interesting experiment has been conducted for six years. Professor Shen Jun said that this experiment is combined with the national Five-Year Plan. Currently, winemaking raw materials mostly use grain, which is costly. If fruit is used for winemaking, a large amount of grain can be saved. The quality of wine depends directly on the quality of the grapes. In the past, when grapes were cultivated in northern China, they had to be buried in soil to prevent frost every winter. This was very labor-intensive and often damaged the buds and branches of the grapes, affecting their growth and fruiting. Botanists have been trying to cultivate a new grape variety that can withstand temperatures of minus 25 degrees Celsius, does not need to be buried, has excellent quality, and is suitable for winemaking.

Starting in 1951, botanists used excellent cultivated varieties such as "Rose Fragrant" to cross with several cold-resistant wild grape species. Then, this hybrid seedling was crossed with its parent (i.e., backcrossing), and then directional cultivation was carried out. Directional cultivation is part of the Michurin theory of the great Soviet biologist. It uses artificial methods to cultivate plant seedlings when they are not yet fully formed, so that they become excellent varieties.

Currently, a total of eight hybrid combinations, 690 hybrid seedlings, and more than 700 seeds have been obtained. After identification, the sugar content of the new varieties has significantly increased. After several years of cold resistance training, regional trials can be carried out in North China, and then推广 (tuī guǎng - popularized/promoted). At the same time, botanists, through observation and analysis of hybrid seedlings, understand the genetic laws of parental characteristics in hybrid offspring, providing scientific arguments for future grape breeding.

In addition, they also conducted investigations on wild mountain grapes, which are abundant in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces, and put forward suggestions to local wineries on how to improve the quality of winemaking.

### 培育抗寒葡萄试验工作有成绩

    培育抗寒葡萄试验工作有成绩
    新华社15日讯　培育抗寒的酿酒用的葡萄新品种试验，已经取得了初步的成就。12日，在中国科学院植物研究所的学术论文讨论会上，沈雋等植物学家提出了两篇关于抗寒葡萄研究的论文。
    这个有趣的试验已经进行了六年。沈雋教授说，这一试验是与国家五年计划相结合的，现在酿酒原料大都用粮食，成本较高。如果用水果来酿酒就可以节约大量粮食。葡萄酒的质量直接依赖于葡萄质量的好坏。我国北部过去栽培葡萄，每逢冬季必须埋土防寒，这样很费人力，并且常使葡萄的芽眼和枝蔓受到损伤，影响生长和结果。植物学家就试图培育出一种能抗摄氏零下二十五度低温，不需埋土，品质优良，适宜酿酒的新的葡萄品种。
    1951年开始，植物学家利用优良的栽培品种如“玫瑰香”同几种抗寒力强的野生种葡萄进行杂交。再用这个杂交苗同它的亲本杂交（即四交），然后作定向培育。定向培育是苏联伟大生物学家米丘林学说中的一部分，它是用人工的办法在植物幼苗未定型时加以培育，使它成为优良品种。
    现在，共获得了八个杂交组合，六百九十个杂交苗以及七百多粒种子。经过鉴定，新品种含糖量显著提高。再经过几年抗寒锻炼后就可以在华北各地作区域试验，然后推广。同时，植物学家通过对杂交苗的观察分析，了解亲本特性在杂交后代的遗传规律，为今后葡萄育种提供科学论据。
    此外，他们还对黑龙江、吉林、辽宁等地盛产的野生山葡萄作了调查，并向当地酿酒厂提出了关于提高酿酒质量的建议。
