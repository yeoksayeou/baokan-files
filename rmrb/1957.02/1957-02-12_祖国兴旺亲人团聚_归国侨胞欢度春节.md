Xinhua News Agency, 11th - Returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students across the country have launched a variety of activities during the Spring Festival to celebrate this traditional festival of the motherland.

    Returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students in Beijing held three Spring Festival gala parties at the Beijing Hotel. Heads of units such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese celebrated the Spring Festival with more than 10,000 returned overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students. At these gala parties, returned overseas Chinese watched dances from India, Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia performed by returned overseas Chinese students. Various literary and artistic units in Beijing also performed wonderful programs for them.

    In Shanghai, returned overseas Chinese held a Spring Festival gala on the evening of the first day of the lunar new year. Xun Rilin, the newly appointed manager of the Shanghai Tobacco Industry Company, and his wife, Yang Xuexin, hosted the entertainment program for the gala. Yang Xuexin loved music when she lived in the United States, and now she is a vocal teacher for several music lovers. At the gala, she played piano accompaniment for a solo sung by one of her students, winning warm applause from the audience. Zheng Guimei, an eight-year-old girl who recently returned from Japan, also performed a Japanese dance. Returned overseas Chinese students in Shanghai also held a Spring Festival gala.

    During the Spring Festival, the hometowns of overseas Chinese in Guangdong and Fujian provinces were immersed in an atmosphere of jubilation. The Overseas Chinese New Village in Guangzhou was even more festive. All the returned overseas Chinese and their families in the village congratulated Zhong Chenghao, a returned overseas Chinese from Canada, on the birth of his first son at the end of last year. This overseas Chinese worker worked overseas for more than 30 years, and moved to the new village less than a year after returning to China in 1955. Huang Zhaobing, a returned overseas Chinese from Vietnam who had drifted overseas for more than 20 years, spent his first Spring Festival after returning to China in the new village. His daughter-in-law, who teaches at Sun Yat-sen University, his grandson and granddaughter, who study at the Overseas Chinese Primary School, and his 83-year-old grandmother, all gathered here to share the joy of five generations under one roof.

    In Fuzhou, You Yangzu, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province and a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, held a get-together with more than 200 returned overseas Chinese and their families. Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, also visited the overseas Chinese hometowns in Hui'an and Haicheng counties in Fujian Province during the Spring Festival, and spent the Spring Festival with the families of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese students. In order to enable more than ten newly returned refugees and poor overseas Chinese to celebrate the Spring Festival, the Quanzhou Municipal People's Committee of Fujian Province allocated 300 yuan in relief funds to assist them.
