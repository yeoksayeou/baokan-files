Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 14th: The Fourth Congress of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front concluded on the afternoon of the 12th.

The congress passed a resolution and the new charter of the Fatherland Front, and elected a new National Committee of the Fatherland Front.

The resolution stipulates concrete measures to further enhance the political activeness and socio-political role of the Fatherland Front in the patriotic education of the working people and in the cause of socialist construction.

The new charter of the Fatherland Front stipulates that the Fatherland Front is the broadest independent socio-political organization of the people, its most important foundation being the alliance of the working class with the working people and the people's intellectuals, and the long-tested leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party over this alliance. It is the broadest organized social pillar of the people's regime and the most mass-based school for patriotic and socialist education of the residents. Its task is: to educate the people of the whole country in the spirit of patriotism and socialism, to enhance the unity of the people, to help the organs of the people's regime to implement the resolutions of the Party and the government, to organize broad social supervision over state organs, to comprehensively develop and consolidate the friendship and cooperation between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving countries, and to fully promote the cause of socialist construction at home.

On the 13th, the newly elected National Committee held a meeting and elected the Executive Committee of the National Committee. Ganev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 15th: The National Committee of the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association was re-established in Sofia on the 14th, and an executive committee consisting of ninety-one members was elected.

The chairman of the Executive Committee is Dragoycheva, a member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Democratic Women's Committee.

The Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association was established as early as 1934 when Bulgaria and the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations, and its activities were banned by the Bulgarian fascist government in the autumn of 1940. After the liberation of Bulgaria, the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association was restored throughout the country. In 1956, the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association merged with the Fatherland Front. However, after the merger, the tasks of the Fatherland Front were too heavy, so it was decided to re-establish a separate Bulgarian-Soviet friendship organization—the National Committee and local committees at all levels.

    保祖国阵线代表大会闭幕
    决定大力加强祖国阵线的工作
    保苏友好协会全国委员会重新成立
    据新华社索非亚14日电　保加利亚祖国阵线第四次代表大会在12日下午闭幕。
    大会通过了一项决议和祖国阵线的新章程，并且选出了新的祖国阵线全国委员会。
    决议规定进一步提高祖国阵线在向劳动人民进行爱国主义教育方面和社会主义建设事业中的政治积极性和社会政治作用的具体措施。
    祖国阵线的新章程规定，祖国阵线是最广泛的人民的独立的社会政治组织，它的最重要的基础是工人阶级同劳动人民和人民知识分子的联盟以及久经考验的保加利亚共产党对这个联盟的领导作用。它是人民政权的最广泛的有组织的社会支柱和对居民进行爱国主义和社会主义教育的最群众性的学校。它的任务是：用爱国主义和社会主义精神教育全国人民，增强人民团结，帮助人民政权机关执行党和政府的决议，组织对国家机关的广泛的社会监督，全面地发展和巩固保加利亚同苏联、人民民主国家以及一切爱好和平国家间的友谊和合作，全力促进国内的社会主义建设事业。
    13日，新选出的全国委员会举行会议，选举了全国委员会的执行委员会。保共中央书记加涅夫当选为执行委员会主席。
    新华社索非亚15日电　保苏友好全国委员会14日在索非亚重新成立，并且选出了一个包括九十一个委员的执行委员会。
    执行委员会的主席是保共中央委员、民主妇女委员会主席德拉戈伊切娃。
    保苏友好协会早在1934年保苏建交时就已成立，在1940年秋天被保加利亚法西斯政府禁止活动。保加利亚解放以后，保苏友好协会又在全国恢复。1956年，保苏友好协会同祖国阵线合并。但是合并后，祖国阵线的任务过于繁重，所以现在决定重新建立单独的保苏友好组织——全国委员会和地方各级委员会。
