	This newspaper reports that people from all walks of life in Jiangsu Province are enthusiastically and actively helping the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, resolving difficulties in various aspects. According to statistics from more than forty counties and cities, including Shuyang, Tongshan, Shanghai, and Nanjing, over 70,000 households of families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and disabled revolutionary soldiers enjoyed over 3,620,000 workdays of preferential treatment, basically ensuring that their living standards were no lower than those of ordinary commune members. With the exception of disaster areas, many families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents increased their income last year compared to 1955.
	The preferential treatment and care for families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents are carried out in various aspects throughout the region. Generally, agricultural cooperatives give priority to the auxiliary labor force among the families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents in terms of division of labor, arranging them to do work within their capabilities. For example, Jin Wenhe and Jin Fengyu, both over sixty years old and families of revolutionary martyrs from Yongfeng First Cooperative in Jianqiao Township, Huaiyin County, can only do light labor. The cooperative arranged for them to look after chickens, feed cattle, and do some light work, recording five work points per day, ensuring their livelihood. When the houses of families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents are dilapidated, the agricultural cooperatives are the first to help repair them. In the Kengyao Agricultural Cooperative in Yazhou Township, Hai'an County, twelve houses belonging to six families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents were dilapidated. The agricultural cooperative allocated 2,800 catties of straw and mobilized cooperative members to help them repair their houses.
	When families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents encounter difficulties in their lives, cadres and the masses also do their best to help solve them. Yan Ruxing, the preferential treatment committee member of Dongping Township, Jianhu County, visited the families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents facing difficulties every day barefoot in the snow during the heavy snowfall early last year. Upon discovering that Military Dependent Sun Hengfu and her daughter were about to run out of food, he immediately sent them grain and relief money. Liu Lanzhen and Yang Hongmei, street cadres from Qianjie Street in Liyang Town, Liyang County, used their spare time to break six and a half cubic meters of stone, sold it for money, and bought cotton clothes and quilts to send to Military Dependent Xia Changyou and Martyr's Family Shi Pugeng to keep them warm. Military Dependent Liu Xiaobao from Jiulong Township, Wujin County, was hospitalized with an illness and needed a large amount of blood transfusions. Township cadres and more than a dozen young people from the agricultural cooperative successively donated 1,400 cc of blood, saving her from danger and restoring her health.

    多方照顾　充分关怀
    江苏优抚工作有成绩
    本报讯　江苏省各界人民，热情地、积极地帮助烈属、军属、革命残废军人，解决各方面的困难。据沭阳、铜山、上海、南京等四十多个县、市统计，即有七万多户烈属、军属、革命残废军人享受三百六十二万多个劳动日优待，基本上保证了他们的生活不低于一般社员的生活水平。除灾区以外，很多烈属、军属去年比1955年增加了收入。
    各地优待和照顾烈属、军属是从各个方面来进行的。一般农业社，都对烈、军属中的辅助劳动力，在分工分业上给予优先照顾，安排他们做力能胜任的工作。如淮阴县涧桥乡永丰一社烈属金文和、金凤余都已六十多岁，只能做轻微劳动，社里就安排他们看鸡、喂牛和做一些轻巧活，每天记五分工，保证了他们的生活。烈、军属的房屋破漏了，农业社就首先帮助修理。海安县雅周乡坑窑农业社有六户烈、军属的十二间房子破漏，农业社就拨出二千八百斤草，发动社员帮他们修屋。
    烈、军属生活有了困难，干部和群众也尽力帮助解决。建湖县东平乡优抚委员严如兴，在去年初下大雪的时候，每天赤脚冒雪访问困难的烈、军属，发觉军属孙恒富娘儿俩快要断粮，立即送去粮食和救济金。溧阳县溧城镇县前街街道干部刘兰珍、杨洪梅等人，利用工作空隙敲碎石六方半，卖了钱买棉衣、棉被送给军属夏长有、烈属史浦庚御寒。武进县九龙乡军属刘小宝生病住医院，需要大量输血，乡干部和农业社的青年十多人，先后输血一千四百西西，把她从危险中救活，恢复了健康。　（章扬）
