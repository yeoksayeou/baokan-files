Editor's Note: After this newspaper published reader Hu Zhongmin's letter "Coasting in Cars is Not a Good Experience" on November 1, 1956, many readers wrote to express their disagreement with Hu Zhongmin's view. Here, we publish an article by Comrade Gong Ju, and we believe that Comrade Gong Ju's opinion is correct.

The People's Daily published Comrade Hu Zhongmin's letter on November 1, 1956, reflecting that some cars were damaged due to coasting in neutral gear. When encountering emergencies, they could not brake flexibly, which easily caused traffic accidents. Therefore, it was believed that coasting in cars was not a good experience. I think the situation reflected by Comrade Hu Zhongmin exists, but it is inappropriate to think that coasting in cars is not a good experience just because some deviations have occurred.

Coasting in cars is a method of saving gasoline that China used during the Anti-Japanese War. Soviet automotive transport scientists have also theoretically proven that using coasting to save gasoline is correct. China's automotive transport departments have universally promoted this experience in the "Safety, Four Fixes, Two Thousand Ton-Kilometer Movement" in 1952 and the "Safety, Savings, 100,000 Kilometer Movement" in 1956. Many excellent car drivers have used this method to save a lot of gasoline for the country. Therefore, this experience should be affirmed. The situations pointed out by Comrade Hu Zhongmin were caused by the lack of good leadership in some places when promoting this experience. For example, some drivers regarded coasting as the only way to save gasoline, resulting in coasting on every road and every slope, which reduced transportation speed. Some drivers damaged vehicle parts and affected driving safety due to improper coasting methods. This should be corrected.

I believe that in the current situation of insufficient gasoline in the country, correctly using coasting is still an adoptable and should be adopted method of saving gasoline. However, when promoting the experience of coasting in cars, all localities should learn from past lessons. It should be made clear that using coasting cannot reduce transportation speed. It should be made clear that coasting experience should be correctly used according to different roads and different traffic conditions. Every driver should be helped to understand when coasting is possible, when coasting is not possible, and which coasting method should be used. In addition, some enterprises' reward systems are not reasonable enough, the gasoline consumption quotas are set too low, and the reward ratio for saving gasoline is too high, which has a negative effect on promoting the coasting experience, and needs to be revised in a timely manner.

### 汽车滑行是好经验

    汽车滑行是好经验
                公鞠
    编者按：1956年11月1日本报发表了读者胡中民同志的来信“汽车滑行不是好经验”以后，许多读者来信表示不同意胡中民同志这个看法。这里，发表公鞠同志的一篇文章，我们认为公鞠同志的意见是正确的。
    人民日报1956年11月1日发表了胡中民同志的来信，反映有些汽车因空档滑行，损坏了机器，遇到紧急情况，又不能灵活刹车，很容易发生交通事故，因而认为汽车滑行不是好经验。我认为胡中民同志反映的情况是存在的，但是，因为发生了一些偏差，就认为汽车滑行不是好经验，是不妥当的。
    汽车滑行，是我国在抗日战争时期就曾经采用过的一种节省汽油的方法。苏联的汽车运输科学工作者，也早就从理论上证明了利用滑行节省汽油是正确的。我国汽车运输部门在1952年开展“安全，四定，两千吨公里运动”和1956年开展“安全，节约、十万公里运动”中，都普遍地推广了这个经验。许多优秀的汽车司机采用这种方法为国家节省了大量的汽油。因此，这个经验是应该肯定的。胡中民同志所指出的一些情况是因为有些地方在推广这个经验中，没有很好的领导才产生的。例如有些司机把滑行当成了节省汽油的唯一方法，形成无路不滑，无坡不滑，结果降低了运输速度；有些司机由于采用滑行办法不妥当，使车辆机件受到损坏，影响了行车安全。这是应该注意纠正的。
    我认为在目前国家汽油不足的情况下，正确地利用滑行仍然是一个可以采用、而且应该采用的一种节省汽油方法。不过各地在推行汽车滑行的经验时，应该接受过去的教训。明确利用滑行不能降低运输速度，明确应该根据不同的道路和不同的交通情况，正确地利用滑行经验，帮助每一个司机搞清楚在什么情况下可以滑行，在什么情况下不可以滑行和什么情况下应该采用那一种滑行方法，此外有些企业的奖励制度不够合理，汽油消耗定额定的过低，节省汽油的奖励比例太大，对推行滑行经验起了一些消极作用，也需要及时修改。
