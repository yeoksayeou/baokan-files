Phnom Penh Correspondence

    Cambodia has passed its third spring since independence, but this year's spring seems particularly bright. This is not due to the climate, because in terms of climate, Cambodia is always in summer. However, from a political climate perspective, since Cambodia has firmly embarked on the path of peace and neutrality, spring has arrived.

    The Fourth National Congress of the People's Socialist Community, held at the beginning of this spring, played an important role in the development of Cambodia's neutral line. This congress announced to the world that Cambodia is a neutral country and demanded that the government enshrine the policy of neutrality into the country's laws. In the words of Prince Sihanouk: "Doing so ensures international guarantees for our neutral policy, and anyone who invades Cambodia will be subject to international sanctions!" The enthusiasm when the resolution on the neutrality issue was passed was deeply moving, with cheers and applause overwhelming the entire venue, Phnom Penh, and all of Cambodia.

    The Cambodian people so warmly welcome and support the policy of neutrality because they have personally experienced its benefits.

    Anyone who has visited the Kingdom of Cambodia is deeply impressed by Cambodia's magnificent ancient culture. Whether in Phnom Penh or in the provinces, one can see ancient buildings and sculptures everywhere. These precious forms of art are truly enviable; Khmer classical dance and music are full of elegance and harmony. However, in many foreign countries, people have little or almost no opportunity to appreciate this beautiful culture and art, and even show ignorance about Cambodia. At the same time, in the past, besides appreciating their own national traditional culture and art, Cambodians had contact almost exclusively with capitalist culture and art. Even films and novels full of pornography, murder, war, and various forms of moral depravity, as well as the most vulgar so-called "striptease" erotic performances, were very popular in Phnom Penh. Many Cambodians did not understand other countries, especially socialist countries, very well. Since the implementation of the neutrality policy, this situation has changed. This spring, cinemas in Phnom Penh have screened several films from China and the Soviet Union. China's rich and colorful traditional arts and Soviet ballet have greatly interested the people of Phnom Penh. A dozen days ago, Cambodians received a cultural delegation from Czechoslovakia for the first time, and the beautiful Slovak folk dances were warmly applauded by the audience. In reporting on this performance, the Cambodian News Agency praised that "the success it has achieved far exceeds the most optimistic expectations." The interest shown by Cambodians in different cultures and arts reflects their desire to have friendly exchanges with other countries. There are reports that the Khmer classical dance troupe will perform abroad this year, and sports teams will also visit China, the Soviet Union, and other countries. A Cambodian visual arts exhibition was recently held in Moscow. People here are extremely interested in this. This is a beautiful flower of the neutral line, and it will bear the precious fruit of friendship.

    Cambodia, which has suffered from colonial rule for a long time, is economically very backward. After political independence, Cambodia urgently needs to strive for economic independence as well. Due to the damage caused by long-term colonial exploitation, Cambodia needs to rely on foreign aid to build its own country, but as in culture and art, in the past it only had contact with capitalist countries. "U.S. aid" can be said to be the country's main foreign aid. In Phnom Penh, there are many strangely shaped buildings and villas built with "U.S. aid"; shops display colorful goods from the United States, France, and Japan; many of the latest American cars drive on the streets; and even fruit stalls sell expensive American fresh grapes, which are also imported with "U.S. aid." "U.S. aid" has made many merchants rich and has also led some officials to become corrupt. "U.S. aid" also pays for a considerable portion of the country's huge military expenditure and some other expenses. France is helping Cambodia build a seaport - Sihanoukville Port, but it is said that the project is progressing very slowly. Western countries have not helped Cambodia establish its own industry - the foundation for economic independence. Therefore, some peculiar situations have emerged: Cambodia's cotton is known throughout the Indochina Peninsula for its good quality, and the conditions for planting cotton are also very good, but Cambodia does not have its own textile industry, and must use a lot of foreign exchange to import cotton yarn and cotton fabrics; Cambodia is extremely rich in forestry resources, but many valuable timbers are allowed to rot, and instead, various papers and plywood for construction must be imported; sugar palms (a type of tropical tree that looks like a palm tree, its fruit juice can be used to make sugar, and the finished product is somewhat similar to China's granulated sugar) and sugarcane are abundant products of this country, but people eat foreign imported sugar; even this country, which has many salt fields, has to use foreign exchange to import salt. This is certainly not a normal phenomenon and is harmful to Cambodia's development of an independent economy.

    This situation has also undergone important changes since the implementation of the neutrality policy. After Prince Sihanouk visited a series of socialist countries such as China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, Cambodia gained respect and friendship in these countries, established economic ties, and obtained economic assistance. Even though diplomatic relations have not yet been established, the People's Republic of China has promised to provide Cambodia with eight hundred million Cambodian riels in gratuitous and unconditional aid to help Cambodia build the four factories it urgently needs: textile, paper, plywood, and cement; the Soviet Union has already promised to provide Cambodia with a modern hospital free of charge, and is still studying other possible aid; Czechoslovakia has promised to donate two generators to Cambodia; Poland will build a surgical room for a hospital in Cambodia. Recently, Chinese and Soviet experts have already conducted resource surveys in Cambodia, and the sites of some factories have been largely determined, waiting only for the final decision of the Cambodian government, and the establishment and construction of these factories can be completed in the near future. The hospital aided by the Soviet Union has been determined to be built in Phnom Penh, with five hundred beds, which is almost equal to one-third of the existing beds in Cambodia (Cambodia currently has 1,700 beds nationwide). In addition, China and Cambodia have signed a trade agreement, and the Soviet Union is negotiating a trade agreement with Cambodia.

    Here, people often mention that Cambodia's first participation in the United Nations General Assembly as a member state at the end of last year was the result of implementing the neutrality policy. Indeed, the policy of neutrality has made Cambodia increasingly occupy an important position internationally. U.S. imperialism has used various means to threaten Cambodia to abandon its neutrality policy; the United States has also instigated Thailand and South Vietnam to impose economic blockades and armed invasions on Cambodia. However, socialist countries and peace-loving people around the world support Cambodia, and Cambodia, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, has adhered to the path of peaceful neutrality. Now, Cambodia's international standing has been further enhanced. It has established diplomatic relations with more than a dozen countries in the world, including four socialist countries, and friendly relations with other countries are also developing. At the end of last year, some foreign countries that were hostile to Cambodia's implementation of the policy of peaceful neutrality predicted that the Cambodian government would collapse and secretly carried out sabotage activities, but the conspiracy did not materialize, and the Cambodian government still firmly implements the policy of neutrality.

    Those countries that once opposed Cambodia's neutrality, like Thailand, are now experiencing a strong neutral tendency within their own country, and some Thai newspapers are praising Cambodia. A Thai newspaper said: "We sympathize with Cambodia's political line. It is fostering conditions for interacting with all countries and will bring unlimited benefits to its own country. Cambodia has set a good example for small countries and for our Thailand." The neutral line has become an irresistible trend in the current development of the international situation.

    The Chinese people have special respect for the Kingdom of Cambodia's implementation of the neutrality policy and feel very close to it. At this time last year, in Beijing, the Chinese people warmly welcomed and received Prince Sihanouk. Prince Sihanouk said movingly: Cambodia, with a population of five million, cannot refuse the friendship of 600 million Chinese people. On February 18th last year, the Sino-Cambodian Joint Statement with important historical significance was published, which not only restored and developed the friendship that existed in the history of the two countries, but also provided an example for peaceful coexistence. In November of the same year, Premier Zhou Enlai paid a return visit to Cambodia, which was the first time the Kingdom of Cambodia received a representative of a socialist country. The Cambodian people's warm and enthusiastic welcome to the Chinese representatives was considered an unprecedented event. This mutual visit further strengthened the friendship between the two countries. Today, on the first anniversary of the publication of the Sino-Cambodian Joint Statement, the Cambodian people, like the Chinese people, have special affectionate feelings for the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.

    Cambodia is passing its fourth spring since independence. May this kingdom become more prosperous and strong!

### 柬埔寨的春天

    柬埔寨的春天
    张瑶
    柬埔寨已经度过独立后的第三个春天，但今年的春天却显得格外明媚。这倒不是气候的原因，因为按气候柬埔寨永远都是夏天。但是从政治气候上讲，柬埔寨坚定地走上和平中立的道路以后，春天也就来到了。
    今年春初召开的人民社会同盟第四届全国大会对柬埔寨中立路线的发展起了重要作用。这个大会向全世界宣布了柬埔寨是个中立国，它要求政府把中立政策制定为国家的法律。用西哈努克亲王的说法：“这样做使我们的中立政策能得到国际保障，谁侵略柬埔寨就要受到国际制裁！”大会通过中立问题决议时的热烈情况是十分动人的，欢呼声和掌声淹没了整个会场、淹没了整个金边和全柬埔寨。
    柬埔寨人民这样热烈欢迎和拥护中立政策，是因为他们亲身体会到了它的好处。
    凡是到过柬埔寨王国访问的人，都对柬埔寨辉煌的古代文化有着深刻的印象。无论在金边或者在外省，人们到处都可以看到古代遗留下的建筑和雕刻，这些珍贵造型艺术令人十分艳羡；高棉的古典舞蹈和音乐充满着优雅同和谐的特点。但是在不少外国，人们却很少或者几乎没有机会欣赏到这种优美的文化艺术，甚至对柬埔寨表现很无知。而同时，在过去，柬埔寨人除了欣赏自己民族的传统文化艺术外，也差不多只和资本主义的文化艺术有接触，连充满色情、凶杀、战争和各种道德堕落的影片和小说，以及最下流的所谓“脱衣艳舞”色情表演在金边也很流行。不少柬埔寨人对其他国家，尤其是社会主义国家很不了解。在实行中立政策以后，这里的情况已经起了变化。今年春天，金边的电影院已经上演了几部来自中国和苏联的影片，中国丰富多采的传统艺术和苏联的芭蕾舞，使金边人民感到很大兴趣。十几天前，柬埔寨人还第一次接待了来自捷克斯洛伐克的文化代表团，斯洛伐克的优美民间舞蹈博得了观众的热烈喝采。柬埔寨通讯社在报道这次演出时，称赞“它所赢得的成功远远超过了最乐观的希望。”柬埔寨人对不同的文化艺术表现的兴趣，正反映了他们希望和其它国家友好往来的愿望。有消息说：高棉古典舞蹈团将在今年到外国演出，体育队也将访问中苏等国。前几天在莫斯科举办了介绍柬埔寨造型艺术的会。这里的人对此极感兴趣。这是中立路线的美丽花朵，它将结出珍贵的友谊果实。
    长期遭受殖民统治的柬埔寨，在经济上是十分落后的。在政治上独立后，柬埔寨亟需在经济上也争取独立。由于长期殖民剥削所造成的损害，使柬埔寨需要借助外援来建设自己的国家，但像在文化艺术方面一样，过去也只和资本主义国家有接触。“美援”可以说是这个国家主要的外援了。在金边有不少奇形怪状的大楼和别墅是用“美援”修建的；商店里摆着五光十色的来自美国、法国、日本的商品，街道上行驶着不少最新式的美国汽车，连水果摊上也出卖着价钱很贵的美国鲜葡萄，这些也是用“美援”进口的。“美援”使不少商人发了财，也使一些官员堕落成为贪污犯。“美援”还支付着这个国家相当庞大的军费开支和一部分其他的开支。法国在帮助柬埔寨建立一个海港——磅逊港，但据说工程进行的很迟缓。西方国家没有帮助柬埔寨建立自己的工业——经济独立的基础。因此出现了一些奇特的情况：柬埔寨的棉花是以质量好而闻名印度支那半岛的，而且植棉条件也很好，可是柬埔寨没有自己的纺织工业，却必须用大量外汇去进口棉纱和棉织品；柬埔寨的林业资源极富，但许多宝贵木材只有任其腐烂，反而要进口各种纸张和建筑用的胶合板；糖树（一种形式像棕榈树的热带树木，它的果实汁水可以制糖，成品有些像我国的砂糖）和甘蔗是这个国家丰富的产品，然而人们吃的却是外国进口的糖；甚至这个拥有不少盐田的国家也得用外汇进口食盐。这当然不是正常的现象，而且对柬埔寨发展独立经济有害。
    这种情况，自执行中立政策后，也发生了重要的变化。西哈努克亲王访问中国、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等一系列社会主义国家以后，柬埔寨在这些国家获得了尊敬和友谊，也建立了经济联系，获得了经济援助。即使还没有建立邦交，中华人民共和国答应无偿地无条件地援助柬埔寨八亿柬币，帮助柬埔寨建立它所迫切需要的纺织、造纸、胶合板和水泥等四个工厂；苏联已经答应无偿地援助柬埔寨建立一座现代化医院，并且还在和柬埔寨研究其他援助的可能；捷克斯洛伐克答应赠给柬埔寨两部发电机；波兰将为柬埔寨建立一个医院的手术室。最近，中国和苏联的专家们已经在柬埔寨进行了资源调查，有些工厂的厂址已大批确定，只等柬埔寨政府的最后决定，这些工厂的设置和施工就可以在不久的将来完成。由苏联援助的医院，已经确定在金边建立，它拥有五百个病床，这几乎等于柬埔寨现有病床三分之一（柬埔寨全国现有病床一千七百个）。此外，中国和柬埔寨已经签订了贸易协定，苏联正在和柬埔寨谈判贸易协定。
    在这里，人们常常提到：去年年底，柬埔寨王国第一次以会员国身份参加联合国大会，是执行中立政策的结果。的确，中立政策使柬埔寨在国际上越来越占有重要的地位。美帝国主义曾经用各种手段进行威胁，要柬埔寨放弃中立政策；美国还唆使泰国和南越对柬埔寨进行经济封锁和武装侵犯。然而全世界社会主义国家和爱好和平的人民，支持柬埔寨，柬埔寨在西哈努克亲王领导下坚持了和平中立路线。现在，柬埔寨的国际地位更加提高了。它已和世界上十几个国家建立了外交关系，其中有四个社会主义国家，和其余国家的友好关系也正在发展。去年年底，一些仇视柬埔寨执行和平中立政策的外国，曾经预言柬埔寨政府要倒台，并且暗中进行破坏活动，然而阴谋并没有实现，柬埔寨的政府仍然坚定执行中立政策。
    那些曾经反对柬埔寨中立的国家，像泰国，现在它国内也产生了强大的中立趋向，泰国的一些报纸赞扬起柬埔寨来了。泰国的一家报纸说：“我们同情柬埔寨的政治路线，他孕育着与各国交往的条件，并将带给自己国家无穷的利益。柬埔寨已经为弱小国家和我们泰国树立了好的榜样。”中立路线已经成为当前国际局势发展中一股不可抗拒的趋势。
    中国人民对柬埔寨王国执行中立政策特别尊敬，也感到十分亲切。我们在去年这个时候，在北京，中国人民热烈地欢迎和接待了西哈努克亲王。西哈努克亲王令人感动地说：拥有五百万人口的柬埔寨不能拒绝六万万中国人民的友谊。去年2月18日，具有重要历史意义的中柬联合声明发表了，它不仅使中柬两国历史上存在的友谊得到恢复和发展，而且为和平共处提供了一个范例。同年11月，周恩来总理到柬埔寨进行回访，这是柬埔寨王国第一次接待一个社会主义国家的代表。柬埔寨人民对中国代表的亲切而热烈的欢迎，被认为是空前的盛事。这一互相访问，进一步加强了两国的友谊。今天，当中柬联合声明发表一周年时，柬埔寨人民同中国人民一样，对两国友好合作关系的发展，抱着特别亲切的感情。
    柬埔寨正在度过它独立后的第四个春天，愿这个王国更加繁荣昌盛！
