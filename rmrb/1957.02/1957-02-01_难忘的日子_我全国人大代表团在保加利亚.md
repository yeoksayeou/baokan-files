    Unforgettable Days
    -- Our Delegation of the National People's Congress in Bulgaria
          By Our Correspondent Li Cheng
    The delegation of the National People's Congress and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, headed by Comrade Peng Zhen, visited the People's Republic of Bulgaria from January 3rd to 11th. Although the visit lasted only a few days, it left a deep impression on the hearts of the Bulgarian people and added a glorious page to the fraternal friendly relations between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples.
        The Chinese and Bulgarian Peoples are Close Brothers
      On the morning of January 3rd, the delegation arrived in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. At the Sofia train station, G. Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, and others warmly welcomed the delegation and accompanied it to the square in front of the station. At this time, the square and its surroundings were filled with welcoming crowds. They held up many banners with the words "Welcome Distinguished Guests from Great China," "Long Live Sino-Bulgarian Friendship," and "Strengthen the Unity of Socialist Countries Headed by the Soviet Union" written in both Chinese and Bulgarian. When Delegation Leader Peng Zhen spoke at the grand welcoming ceremony, before the translation was even finished, the welcoming people could not wait to wave flowers, branches, and red silk, and cheer enthusiastically. A Bulgarian comrade named Zokov, who was familiar with the reporter, could not help but put his two thumbs together and say, "The Chinese and Bulgarian people are close brothers."
        A Friendly "Snowball Fight"
      On January 4th and 5th, the leaders of the Bulgarian National Assembly, the Party and government met with the delegation separately. The delegation was also invited to attend the last day of the Eighth Special Session of the Bulgarian National Assembly and paid a visit to the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Sofia Municipal People's Congress. During these meetings and visits, the delegation heard more than once a very simple but very kind sentence: "You (referring to the delegation) are in Bulgaria as if you are at home." During the visit, the delegation personally experienced the deep meaning of this sentence.
    January 6th was Sunday. People who had worked hard for a week, as usual, went to the scenic mountain areas near Sofia for a pleasant holiday. Borovets Resort is one of the most popular mountain areas. Today, here, the Chinese delegation also shared the joy of this holiday with the citizens of Sofia.
    In the morning, after visiting Bulgaria's largest Stalin Reservoir, the delegation drove to Borovets Resort. The resort is located in the Rila Mountains, with a layer of snow more than three inches thick like a white velvet carpet covering the mountain slopes. Dense pine forests were covered with cotton-like snow clothes. Houses for holidaymakers were distributed on the mountain slopes. Just as the delegation was admiring this rare and beautiful scenery, a group of holidaymakers ran out of a house towards the delegation. As they ran, they shouted "Ura!" (meaning "Long live!") At this time, someone threw a snowball at the cheering people, and a friendly snowball fight began. Delegation Leader Peng Zhen, Deputy Leader Cheng Qian, and others also joined the "battle." Happy laughter echoed in the valley and among the pine forests. After the "snowball fight," Peng Zhen, Cheng Qian, and others shook hands with these happy holidaymakers to say goodbye, and left this unforgettable resort by car amid warm applause and cheers. A Bulgarian comrade who accompanied the delegation on the tour said with great interest: "In Bulgaria, only the closest people play snowball fights to amuse themselves."
      With Members of the Agricultural Production Cooperative
    On January 7th, after a light snowfall, the weather turned warmer. The snow on the ground melted into water. The streets were washed clean and shiny by the snowmelt. The delegation left Sofia by car and followed the smooth international highway to Plovdiv, the second largest city in Bulgaria.
    In the central square of Plovdiv, after receiving the warm welcome of more than 70,000 citizens, the delegation conducted visits separately. Delegation Leader Peng Zhen and others came to the New Life Agricultural Production Cooperative in the village of Brestovitsa in the suburbs.
    This cooperative was established in 1948. At the beginning of its establishment, there were only 80 peasant households with 4,000 decares (each decare is equal to one and a half mu) of cultivated land. By January 1951, due to the continuous increase in crop yields and the continuous increase in income of cooperative members, the peasants in the village who had not joined the cooperative applied to join the cooperative. Now, this cooperative has more than 1,300 peasant households and more than 27,000 decares of cultivated land. In addition to growing grains, the cooperative also grows grapes, vegetables, etc., and brews its own wine.
    Leader Peng Zhen stepped out of the car with a smile in front of the village people's council building. The cooperative members who were waiting here immediately gathered around. In the crowd, there was a young couple, dressed in beautiful Bulgarian national costumes. The man was holding a pot of wine to toast Peng Zhen, and the woman was holding two large plates. One plate contained a round loaf of bread, and the other plate contained fried yellow salt. She asked Peng Zhen to break off a piece of bread and dip a little salt as a snack with the wine. At first, we guessed: "This beautiful young couple is probably getting married today!?" After asking, we learned that this is a traditional etiquette for Bulgarians to welcome the most distinguished guests.
    After the young couple toasted the Chinese guests, they, along with several other young men and women wearing the same costumes, danced a happy Bulgarian folk dance on the spacious steps in front of the village people's council to welcome the Chinese guests.
    After the Chinese guests appreciated the beautiful and moving dance of the cooperative members, they were accompanied by Dimitar Damyanov, the director of the cooperative, to enter the village people's council room.
    Here, on the table, were plates full of large, purple and transparent grapes, bright red apples, and bottles of wine. The host introduced in detail to the guests the development process and current situation of this agricultural production cooperative. When talking about the fact that all the peasants in the village became members of the cooperative on January 7, 1951, cooperative director Damyanov happily said to Peng Zhen: "The day you came to us is the same day that all the peasants in our village embarked on the socialist road six years ago. Today, our cooperative has a double celebration." At this time, Peng Zhen and the host held hands tightly. Then, Peng Zhen raised his glass to congratulate the members of the New Life Agricultural Production Cooperative on achieving greater success on the road of agricultural cooperativization.
    When parting, the cooperative's girls gave each of the Chinese guests a silk handkerchief embroidered with care as a gift for this memorable meeting.
              DANCE OF UNITY
    After visiting Plovdiv, Dimitrovgrad and other cities, the delegation returned to Sofia by special train on the afternoon of January 8th.
    On the evening of January 9th, G. Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, Kozovsky, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Assembly, and Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, held a grand banquet in the hall of the Council of Ministers to entertain the Chinese delegation.
    At the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly rose to toast the fraternal friendship between China and Bulgaria and the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.
    After the banquet, in the brightly lit hall, the hosts and guests joined hands to form a circle and danced the Bulgarian collective dance to the rhythm of beautiful and melodious music. Delegation Leader Peng Zhen, Bulgarian party and government leaders Zhivkov, Comrade Yugov and others also joined the ranks of the dancers. Comrade Chervenkov, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, who had rarely danced in the past, also broke with past conventions that night.
    Some people call this dance the "Dance of Unity," which is just right.
      Bring Deep Friendship to the Chinese People
    On the morning of January 11th, the Chinese delegation was about to leave Sofia by plane for a friendly visit to Albania.
    In the lounge of Sofia Airport, Delegation Leader Peng Zhen spoke with a reluctant mood. He said: "During the short visit, we visited rural areas and cultural institutions, and had cordial talks with workers, peasants, intellectuals, responsible comrades of the National Assembly, the government, and the Party, as well as many comrades in other fields. We deeply feel the Bulgarian people's boundless love and deep friendship for the Chinese people. We will convey this friendship of your people to the Chinese people."
    Before boarding the plane, Delegation Leader Peng Zhen hugged and kissed G. Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, Kozovsky, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Assembly, and others who came to see the delegation off, tightly and reluctantly.

    难忘的日子
    ——我全国人大代表团在保加利亚
          本报记者　李成
    以彭真同志为首的我全国人民代表大会和北京市人民委员会代表团，从1月3日到11日访问了保加利亚人民共和国。虽然这次访问的时间只有短短的几天，但是它在保加利亚人民的心里已经留下了深刻的印象，它为中保两国人民兄弟般的友好关系增添了光辉的一页。
        中保两国人民是亲兄弟
      1月3日上午，代表团到达了保加利亚首都索非亚。在索非亚车站上，保国民议会主席团主席格·达米扬诺夫等热忱地迎接了代表团，并陪同代表团来到车站前面的广场上。这时，在广场和广场的周围到处都站满了欢迎的人群。他们高举着许多标语牌，上面用中保两种文字写着：“欢迎来自伟大中国的贵宾”、“中保友谊万岁”、“加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结”等字样。代表团团长彭真在这盛大的欢迎会上讲话时，翻译还没有翻完，欢迎的人们就迫不及待地挥动着鲜花、树枝、红绸子，热情地欢呼起来。一位同记者熟识的保加利亚同志佐科夫情不自禁地把两个大拇指并在一起说：“中国人民和保加利亚人民是亲密的兄弟。”
        一场友谊的“雪战”
      1月4日和5日，保国民议会和党政领导人分别接见了代表团，代表团并且还应邀参加了保国民议会第八次特别会议的最后一天会议，拜会了索非亚市人民会议执行委员会主席。在这些接见和拜会中，代表团不止一次地听到这样一句非常简单而十分亲切的话：“你们（指代表团）来到保加利亚，就像在家里一样。”代表团在访问期间亲身体会到了这句话的深切含意。
    1月6日是星期天。辛勤工作了一周的人们，照例要到索非亚附近的风景优美的山区去愉快地度假日。保罗维茨休养地就是人们最喜爱去的山区之一。今天，在这里，中国代表团也同索非亚的市民们共享了这一休假日的乐趣。
    上午，代表团参观了保加利亚最大的斯大林水库以后，乘汽车来到了保罗维茨休养地。休养地位在里拉山中，山坡上铺着一层三寸多厚的像白绒毯子一样的积雪，稠密的松林披着棉花似的雪衣，一座座供度假日的人们居住的房屋，分布在山坡上。代表团正在赞叹这少有的优美景致的时刻，一群度假的人们从一座房屋里向代表团跑来。他们一边跑，一边欢呼“乌拉！”（万岁的意思）这时不知是谁向欢呼的人们投了一个雪球，于是一场友谊的雪战就开始了。代表团团长彭真、副团长程潜等也都参加了“战斗”。欢乐的笑声振响在山谷和松林间。“雪战”结束后，彭真、程潜等同这些幸福的休假者亲切地握手告别，并在人们的热烈掌声和欢呼声中乘汽车离开了这个令人难忘的休养地。一位陪同代表团一起游览的保加利亚同志兴致勃勃地说：“在保加利亚，只有最亲近的人们才打雪仗逗乐的。”
      同农业生产合作社社员在一起
    1月7日，一阵细雪过后，天气转暖。地上的积雪融化成水。街道上被雪水洗得精光发亮。代表团乘汽车离开索非亚，顺着平整的国际公路，来到了保加利亚的第二大城市普罗夫迪夫。
    在普罗夫迪夫市中心的广场上，代表团领受了七万多市民热情欢迎的盛意后，分别进行了访问。代表团团长彭真等，来到了市郊布列斯托维查村的新生农业生产合作社。
    这个合作社是在1948年成立的。初成立时，只有八十户农民，四千狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一亩半）耕地。到1951年1月，由于合作社耕地产量不断提高和社员收入不断增加，村里没有入社的农民都申请加入了合作社。现在，这个合作社共有一千三百多户农民，两万七千多狄卡尔耕地。合作社除了种植谷物外，还种植葡萄、菜蔬等，并且自己酿制葡萄酒。
    彭真团长在村人民会议的楼房前微笑着走出汽车。等候在这里的合作社的社员们，登时围拢了上来。在人丛中，有一对男女青年，身着漂亮的保加利亚民族服装，男的端着一壶葡萄酒给彭真敬酒，女的托着两个大盘子，一个盘子里是一个圆形的大面包，另一个盘子里是炒得发黄的盐面，她请彭真掰一块面包，蘸一点盐作下酒菜。起初，我们猜想：“这一对漂亮的男女青年大概是今天结婚的吧！？”经过询问后，才知道这是保加利亚人迎接最尊贵的客人的一种传统礼节。
    这对男女青年给中国客人敬酒后，就同另外几个穿着同样服装的男女青年一起，在村人民会议门前的宽敞的台阶上，跳起欢乐的保加利亚民族舞蹈，欢迎中国客人。
    中国客人欣赏了社员们的优美动人的舞蹈以后，由合作社主任迪米特尔·达米扬诺夫陪同，进入村人民会议室。
    这里，在桌子上，摆着满盘发紫透明的大粒葡萄，鲜红的苹果和成瓶的葡萄酒。主人向客人详细地介绍了这个农业生产合作社的发展过程和现在的情况。当谈到1951年1月7日全村农民都成为合作社的社员时，合作社主任达米扬诺夫愉快地对彭真说：“你们到我们这里来的这一天，正是六年前我们全村农民走上社会主义道路的一天。今天，我们合作社真是双喜临门。”这时，彭真和主人的手紧紧地握在一起。然后，彭真举杯祝贺新生农业生产合作社的社员们在农业合作化的道路上，获得更大的成就。
    临别时，合作社的姑娘们把她们精心绣成的丝手绢送给中国客人每人一条，作为这次令人怀念的会见的赠礼。
              团　结　舞
    代表团在访问了普罗夫迪夫、季米特洛夫格勒等城市后，在1月8日下午乘专车返回索非亚。
    1月9日晚上，保国民议会主席团主席格·达米扬诺夫、国民议会执行委员会主席科佐夫斯基和部长会议主席于哥夫，在部长会议大厅里举行盛大宴会，招待中国代表团。
    在宴会上，宾主一再起立，举杯祝贺中保两国的兄弟般的友谊，祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结。
    宴会结束后，在灯光辉煌的大厅里，宾主手挽着手拉成一个圆圈，合着美妙动听的音乐的节拍，尽情地跳着保加利亚集体舞。代表团团长彭真、保加利亚党和政府的领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫同志等，也加入了舞蹈者的行列。过去很少跳过舞的保部长会议副主席契尔文科夫同志，这天晚上也打破了以往的惯例。
    有人把这次舞蹈称为“团结舞”，真是再恰当也没有了。
      把深厚的友谊带给中国人民
    1月11日上午，中国代表团就要乘飞机离开索非亚前往阿尔巴尼亚作友好访问了。
    在索非亚机场的休息室里，代表团团长彭真怀着惜别的心情讲了话。他说：“在短短的访问期间，我们参观了农村和文化机关，同工人、农民、知识分子、国民议会、政府和党的负责同志们以及其他方面的许多同志进行了亲切的交谈。我们深深感到保加利亚人民对中国人民的无比的热爱和深厚的友谊。我们将把你们人民的这种友谊转达给中国人民。”
    在临上飞机前，代表团团长彭真同前来欢送代表团的保国民议会主席团主席格·达米扬诺夫、国民议会执行委员会主席科佐夫斯基等紧紧地紧紧地拥抱、接吻，恋恋不舍。
