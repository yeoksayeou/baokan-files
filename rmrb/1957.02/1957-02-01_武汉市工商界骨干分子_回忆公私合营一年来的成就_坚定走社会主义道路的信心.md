Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Dispatch. On the afternoon of the 21st, key members of Wuhan's industrial and commercial circles held a forum to discuss the achievements and feelings of the past year of joint state-private ownership.

During the discussion, everyone believed that in the past year, the vast number of industrialists and businessmen actively participated in the socialist competition together with the workers and created many advanced and exemplary deeds. By the third quarter of last year, more than 2,800 private personnel had been selected as advanced producers and advanced workers. Many people also achieved excellent results in participating in political and theoretical studies.

When talking about the achievements of the enterprises in the past year, the industrialists and businessmen praised the benefits of joint state-private ownership. Lu Shaoqiu, the former manager of the private Meifeng Electric Material Store and now a consultant to the Municipal Transportation Electrical Equipment Company, said that before the joint operation of the electrical material industry in December 1955, the total turnover of the entire industry was only more than 40,000 yuan, while in December 1956, the turnover reached 700,000 yuan. Before the joint operation of the silk and cloth industry, most of the stores were losing money. After the joint operation, not only was the phenomenon of losses eliminated, but also more than 100,000 yuan of profits were turned over to the state.

The industrialists and businessmen felt that recalling the achievements of the past year of joint operation further strengthened their confidence and determination to take the socialist road.

    回忆公私合营一年来的成就  坚定走社会主义道路的信心
    据新华社武汉电　21日下午，武汉市工商界骨干分子举行座谈会，漫谈公私合营一年来的成就和感想。
    座谈中大家认为一年来广大工商业者积极地和职工一道参加了社会主义竞赛，并且创造了许多先进、模范事迹，到去年第三季度为止，已经有二千八百多个私方人员被评选为先进生产者和先进工作者；在参加政治、理论各种学习中也有很多人得到了优良成绩。
    在谈到企业这一年中取得的成就时，工商业者都盛赞公私合营的好处。原来是私营美丰电料行经理，现在是市交通电工器材公司顾问的吕少秋说，电料行业在1955年12月份全行业合营以前，全业的营业额只四万多元，而1956年12月份营业额就达到了七十万元。绸布业在合营前，大部分店子都亏本，合营后不仅消灭了亏本现象，而且上缴了十多万元的利润。
    工商业者都感到回忆合营一年来的成就更加坚定了走社会主义道路的信心和决心。
