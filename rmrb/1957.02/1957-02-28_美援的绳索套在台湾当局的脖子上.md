U.S. Aid's Rope Around the Neck of the Taiwan Authorities
Gu Fan

    In February, "pro-American and anti-Chiang" elements in Taiwan, with the support of the United States, continued to quarrel with Kuomintang newspapers. Taipei's Songshan Airport also appeared particularly lively. American generals, officials, congressmen, tycoons, and all kinds of "experts" came and went in batches. While enduring the ridicule of "pro-American and anti-Chiang" publications, high-ranking Kuomintang military and government officials were busy welcoming and seeing off Americans. Among them was a group led by Fairless, chairman of the "Citizens Advisory Committee on Mutual Security Program," and several committee members. They were sent by Eisenhower to Taiwan on a U.S. military aircraft to inspect the use of U.S. aid. After inspecting U.S.-Chiang military bases in Taiwan, watching American-style exercises of the Chiang army, and investigating the extent of U.S. control over Taiwan through U.S. aid, Fairless said at a press conference before leaving Taiwan on February 7 that he was "very pleased and satisfied" with the effectiveness of U.S. aid in Taiwan, and praised the Taiwan authorities' attitude toward U.S. aid as "appropriate and shrewd."

    After this message of "great pleasure and satisfaction" from the representative of Wall Street was published in Taiwanese newspapers, the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan had a unique feeling in their hearts upon reading it. Before Fairless arrived in Taiwan, a Taiwanese economic publication had already lamented: "According to recent remarks made by American personnel after inspecting U.S. aid work here, they almost unanimously believe that the spirit of cooperation in implementing U.S. aid is better than in other regions. Such words of praise are truly laughable; because this is the result of subordinating oneself to others to the point of complete obedience."

    U.S. Troops Arrive to "Defend," "Provincial Government" Must Move

    How do the Taiwan authorities "almost completely obey"? This is clearly demonstrated by the Kuomintang "Taiwan Provincial Government"'s hurried move in November last year. In October last year, the Pentagon ordered the removal of Ingersoll from his concurrent position as commander of the Seventh Fleet and appointed him as the commander of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, stationed in Taipei with full authority to command the U.S. military and Kuomintang troops in the Taiwan region. With the expansion of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, it has become customary for American military personnel in Taiwan to occupy the best houses. The Kuomintang "Taiwan Provincial Government" and its affiliated institutions owned many relatively beautiful houses, which were targeted by the Americans. As a result, the Kuomintang "Taiwan Provincial Government" was forced to hurriedly move from Taipei to Taichung in November last year to make room for the Americans to live in. Before this, the American military had already set its sights on the most beautiful building in Taipei, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation Building, forcing the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to move out so that the U.S. military could occupy it.

    The Humiliation of Chiang's Military Officers and Soldiers

    The "aid" that the United States gives to the Taiwan authorities is divided into two main categories: military aid and economic aid. From 1951 to 1956, the United States invested approximately 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in "aid" to Taiwan, of which military aid accounted for approximately 1.9 billion U.S. dollars. Most of this military aid consists of outdated weapons and equipment.

    The U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan is now fully responsible for processing the transfer of military aid to Taiwan. Approximately three thousand officers and soldiers of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group have become the "supreme emperors" of Chiang's military officers and soldiers. Personnel from the advisory group have controlled units of Chiang's army down to the company or equivalent level. The construction of a bunker, the departure of a warship, or the take-off of an aircraft by Chiang's army must be approved by personnel from the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, on the grounds that U.S. aid is involved.

    Zhou Yuanning, a former lieutenant of the Chiang army's Joint Logistics Headquarters, said after returning to the mainland that when he was in the Chiang army's Ordnance Department, an American soldier named Walker in the advisory office often came into the office to gesture and issue orders. At this time, the Kuomintang major who was the section chief in the office had to stand at attention respectfully and repeatedly say yes. This American soldier had also learned more than ten Chinese characters, which he often used to show off, using "不好" (bù hǎo, not good), "不行" (bù xíng, no way), "顶不好" (dǐng bù hǎo, extremely bad), "糟糕" (zāo gāo, terrible) and so on the most. A Chiang army major having to stand at attention for an American soldier typifies the humiliating situation that Chiang's military officers and soldiers are in under U.S. aid.

    The United States Controls Economic Power

    Over the past six years, the United States has invested approximately 600 million U.S. dollars in economic aid to Taiwan. Part of this is nominally "military counterpart aid," and the rest is mostly the dumping of surplus agricultural products by the United States to Taiwan under the guise of economic aid. The amount of U.S. aid that is actually invested in industrial and agricultural production and construction accounts for less than 20% of the total economic aid. According to calculations by Taiwanese newspapers, this amount of money "accumulated over ten years, still cannot build a Taiwan Sugar Corporation of its current scale."

    The United States has already directly controlled Taiwan's economic power through this economic aid. The U.S. International Cooperation Administration Taiwan Branch presides over economic aid there, and all major financial and economic measures of the Chiang Kai-shek Group must be approved by the U.S. International Cooperation Administration Taiwan Branch. The Chiang Kai-shek Group's Executive Yuan also has two institutions, the "Economic Stabilization Board" and the "U.S. Aid Utilization Committee," with real power controlled by American representatives.

    Although the amount of U.S. economic aid invested in production and construction projects is minimal, the United States attaches particularly harsh conditions when investing aid funds in Taiwan's production sector, thereby controlling Taiwan's important factories, mines, and transportation industries. For example, after the Taiwan Power Company accepted U.S. aid and investment from the American Westinghouse Electric Company, it has repeatedly increased electricity rates over the years due to the coercion of the Americans. On February 19, a Kuomintang "legislator" requested a reduction in the interest rate on U.S. aid loans borrowed by the Taiwan Power Company because it was too high, but was rejected. The twists and turns in the planned construction of the Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan further exposed the true face of U.S. aid. Taiwanese newspapers said that the Taiwan authorities had repeatedly requested the United States to reduce the amount of surplus agricultural products imported into Taiwan by 12 million U.S. dollars and allocate 6 million U.S. dollars to build the Shihmen Reservoir, but the United States refused. The reason is that the United States is afraid that after Taiwan builds the Shihmen Reservoir, grain production will increase, which will affect the U.S. dumping of surplus agricultural products such as wheat to Taiwan.

    How Will the Taiwan Authorities Deal with Themselves

    U.S. aid has not been able to solve the difficulties of the Taiwan authorities. The Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan has budget deficits every year; the tax burden on Taiwanese residents has increased year after year; the amount of Taiwan dollars issued had increased to 58 times that of June 1949 by 1956, and prices had risen to 8.3 times that of June 1949. On the other hand, the result of the Chiang Kai-shek Group accepting U.S. aid to maintain the remnants of its regime is that its military and economic power in Taiwan is gradually falling into the hands of the Americans, and Kuomintang military and government officials in Taiwan are often subjected to personal insults by Americans.

    A Kuomintang "legislator" once angrily questioned Yu Hongjun, the Kuomintang "Executive Yuan President": "Am I utilizing U.S. aid? Or is U.S. aid utilizing me?" Recently, a Taiwanese publication published a commentary, accusing "American friends who are engaged in U.S. aid work often have a sense of superiority in their attitude, which aroused the anger of the recipients. They use the posture of a guest dominating the host, forcing the recipients to swallow their opinions whole, otherwise they will get very angry, or threaten to stop aid, and many words go beyond the scope of politeness." From this understated statement, one can imagine the sadness of the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities who are subject to others' whims. A Taiwanese newspaper also believes that the Taiwan authorities' excessive reliance on U.S. aid, which makes them subject to others, is a great hidden worry, and they should think deeply and plan early about "how they will deal with themselves?"

    美援的绳索套在台湾当局的脖子上
    古凡
    2月间，台湾的“拥美反蒋”分子在美国撑腰下，继续和国民党报刊吵吵嚷嚷。台北的松山机场也显得特别热闹。美国的将军、官员、议员、大亨和各式各样的“专家”，去了一批又来一批。正遭受着“拥美反蒋”刊物冷嘲热讽的国民党高级军政官员，在挨骂的同时，忙着给美国人迎来送往。其中一批是美国“共同安全计划公民顾问委员会”主席费尔勒斯和委员多人，他们奉艾森豪威尔的命令，乘坐着美国军用专机到台湾视察美援使用情况。费尔勒斯在台湾视察了美蒋军事基地、观看了蒋军的美式演习、考察了美援对台湾控制的情况以后，2月7日离开台湾前在记者招待会上说，他对美援在台湾的使用效果感到“十分欣慰和满意”，并且赞扬台湾当局对待美援的态度“适当而且精明”。
    这个华尔街的代表人物的“十分欣慰和满意”的消息在台湾报纸上登载后，台湾国民党军政人员读了，真是别有一番滋味在心头。在费尔勒斯到台湾以前，一家台湾的经济刊物早已发出感慨：“据近来美方人员视察此间美援工作以后的表示，几乎一致认为执行美援的合作精神，较其他区域为佳。此种赞许之词，实在使人啼笑皆非；因为这是屈己从人几至全听摆布的结果。”
    美军来“协防”，“省府”要搬家
    台湾当局怎样“几至全听摆布”？这从国民党“台湾省政府”在去年11月狼狈大搬家一事，也明显地表示出来。去年10月间，五角大楼命令免去英格索尔原任第七舰队司令的兼职，派他专任美军协防台湾司令部司令，驻守在台北全权指挥台湾地区的美军和国民党军队。美军协防台湾司令部的机构扩大了，美国军事人员在台湾要霸居最好的房子，已经成为惯例。而国民党“台湾省政府”所属各机构拥有不少比较漂亮的房子，被美国人看中了。于是，国民党“台湾省政府”在去年11月间被迫匆匆忙忙从台北市搬迁到台中市，腾出房子来让美国人居住。在这以前，美国军事机构已经看中了台北市最漂亮的台湾糖业公司大厦，迫使台糖公司搬走了，让美军占用。
    蒋军官兵的屈辱
    美国给台湾当局的“援助”，分成军事援助和经济援助两大类。从1951年到1956年，美国投在台湾的“援助”约值二十五亿美元，其中军事援助约占了十九亿美元。这种军事援助大部分是陈旧的武器和装备。
    美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团现在全权负责处理拨交台湾的军事援助。约三千名美军顾问团官兵成了蒋军官兵的“太上皇”。顾问团人员已经控制到蒋军营连或相当于营连的单位。蒋军修筑一个碉堡，舰艇出海一次，飞机起飞一次，都要经过美军顾问团人员批准，理由是其中都牵涉到美援。
    前蒋军联勤总部中尉周远宁回到祖国大陆后说，他在蒋军兵工署的时候，顾问室有个名叫瓦克的美国兵，常常进办公室指手划脚传达命令，这时办公室内的蒋军少校科长要毕恭毕敬地立正，连连称是。这个美国兵还学会了十多个汉字，常常夹在话里卖弄，用得最多的是“不好”、“不行”、“顶不好”、“糟糕”等等。蒋军少校要向美国士兵立正，这事典型地反映了美援下的蒋军官兵所处的屈辱境地。
    美国控制了经济大权
    六年来，美国投在台湾的经济援助约值六亿美元。其中一部分名为“军事配合援助”，其余大部分是美国在经济援助的名义下向台湾倾销剩余农产品。至于真正投在工农业生产建设方面的美援，还占不到经济援助总额20％。照台湾报纸计算，这种款项“累计十年，还不能建成一个目前规模的台湾糖业公司”。
    美国已经通过这种经济援助，直接控制了台湾的经济大权。美国国际合作署台湾分署在那里主持经济援助，蒋介石集团的一切重大财政经济措施，都要由美国国际合作署台湾分署批准。蒋介石集团行政院内，还设了“经济安定委员会”和“美援运用委员会”两个机构，由美国代表操纵着实权。
    美国的经济援助投在生产建设事业方面的款项，虽然寥寥无几，但是，美国在把援款投在台湾生产事业方面时，都附带有特别苛刻的条件，因此控制了台湾重要的工厂、矿山、交通事业。例如台湾电力公司接受美援和美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司投资后，几年来一再增加电费，就是由于美国人的要挟。本月19日，国民党的一名“立法委员”因台湾电力公司借入的美援贷款利息太高，要求减低，但是被拒绝了。台湾计划修建石门水库中的波折，更暴露了美援的真面目。台湾报纸说，台湾当局曾再三要求美国把剩余农产品输入台湾的数额减少一千二百万美元，而拨付六百万美元来修建石门水库，但美国却不答应。原因是美国害怕台湾建成石门水库后，粮食产量增加，会影响美国向台湾倾销小麦等剩余农产品。
    台湾当局将何以自处
    美援并没有能够解救台湾当局的困难。台湾蒋介石集团的预算年年都有赤字；台湾居民税收负担连年加重；台币发行额到1956年已经增加为1949年6月的五十八倍，物价上升为1949年6月的八点三倍。另一方面，蒋介石集团接受美援维持残局的结果，却使它在台湾的军事和经济的权力，日渐旁落到美国人的手中，台湾国民党军政官员还常常受到美国人的人身侮辱。
    曾经有一个国民党“立法委员”气愤地向国民党“行政院长”俞鸿钧质问：“是我运用美援？还是美援运用我？”最近，一家台湾刊物发表评论，指责“执行美援工作的美国友人，在态度上常带有优越感，激起了受援者的愤怒。他们以喧宾夺主的姿态，强使受援者生吞活剥地接受他们的意见，否则便大发脾气，或以停止援助为要挟，许多语言超越礼貌范围以外。”从这种轻描淡写的语句中，也可想见台湾国民党当局仰人鼻息的悲哀。一家台湾报纸并且认为，台湾当局过分依赖美援，以致俯仰由人，是一种莫大之隐忧，应该早日深谋远虑，想想“将何以自处？”
