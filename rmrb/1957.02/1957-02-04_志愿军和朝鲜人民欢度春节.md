Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 1st. Chinese People's Volunteer Army officers and soldiers celebrated the Spring Festival together with the Korean people. On the night of the Spring Festival, officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army leadership organs and local Korean residents held a lantern party with more than 2,000 people.

The People's Committee of South Pyongan Province organized a慰问团 (comfort group), carrying gifts such as apples and rice to慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude to) a certain unit of the Volunteer Army guarding the west coast. The art troupe of South Pyongan Province will also hold several days of慰问 (performance of gratitude and sympathy) performances for the Volunteer Army troops. Another Volunteer Army unit stationed on the west coast sent representatives during the Spring Festival to慰问 (express sympathy and solicitude to) a certain naval unit of the Korean People's Army guarding the coast side by side. Representatives of a certain anti-aircraft artillery battalion of the Korean People's Army held a get-together and forum with officers and soldiers of a certain Volunteer Army unit.

Employee representatives of a state-owned farm in central Korea became honored guests of the Volunteer Army tank unit stationed there on the Spring Festival. The employees of this farm and the officers and soldiers of the tank unit have established a deep friendship over the past year. Thanks to the help of the Volunteer Army tank soldiers, this farm increased its grain production significantly last year.

Volunteer Army units stationed in areas such as Pyonggang and Cheorwon also invited local Korean government leaders, resident people's representatives, and representatives of the Korean People's Army units guarding the positions side by side to celebrate the Spring Festival together. The Volunteer Army and Korean People's Army units stationed on Shangganling held a friendly gathering on the snowy front line. The Volunteer Army Logistics Department and other units also organized秧歌 (Yangge dance) teams and stilt teams to congratulate the local government and the families of Korean People's Army soldiers and martyrs. Many officers and soldiers used the holidays to repair houses and fetch water for the Korean people, and voluntarily swept snow and paved roads on the highways, starting the activity of "doing a good deed for the Korean people."
