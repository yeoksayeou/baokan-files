New Things in the Countryside

    An Old Lady Started with One Pig
    Whenever Li Ernv, an old lady who raises pigs, is mentioned, the people of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Kelan County, Shanxi Province, will say that she is a pig-raising expert.
    The old lady started with one pig. In the winter of 1949, she bought a small sow with four dou of millet and fed it every day like she was raising a child. The little sow grew up, and the following year, it gave birth to twenty-eight fat piglets. From then on, the number of pigs raised by the old lady's family increased year by year. In addition to selling two to four litters of piglets each year, she also raised several large pigs at home.
    Before liberation, the old lady's family often lacked firewood and rice. In recent years, because she raised a large number of pigs, this poverty has changed. In recent years, she has sold more than two hundred piglets to villages such as Xibaoyu and Yanjia Ping, earning more than 900 yuan. This year, the income from raising pigs reached more than 350 yuan. Now, the old lady's family has built a new house and added many new furniture and clothes. She often says to people: "Listening to the government is absolutely right. If I hadn't raised so many pigs, how could I have built a new house and added these things!" She also said: In the future, she will maintain raising one boar, two meat pigs, and two sows every year; and sell two meat pigs to the state every year. In this way, she can earn at least 450 yuan each year. Therefore, the villagers all say: "Li Ernv is really a pig-raising model!"

    Yang Xixian's Three Years of Great Contributions - Creating Sixteen New Farm Tools
    Yang Xixian, a member of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Nanzhushan Township, Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, has created and modified sixteen new-style farm tools since 1954. After technical appraisal by relevant departments, most of these new farm tools have been promoted throughout the province.
    Yang Xixian was a student about to graduate from an intermediate normal school. After returning home due to illness at the end of 1952, he settled down at home to engage in agricultural production. In recent years, he has made great contributions to the development of agricultural production with the knowledge he has learned. For example, the manure accumulation tool he made, the "animal-powered grass scraping machine," increased the efficiency of scraping grass by fifteen times compared to manual scraping; the fertilizer application tool "point fertilizer applicator" was three times faster than applying ash by hand; and when the drought was serious, he also manufactured an accurate waterwheel speedometer, which solved the urgent problem of unifying waterwheel work points for the agricultural cooperative at that time.
    In 1955, Yang Xixian was named a special-class farm tool improvement model in Hunan Province and attended the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference. In 1956, because he created and improved seven farm tools, he was again named a special-class farm tool improvement model in Yuanjiang County and gloriously attended the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference held in January 1957. The young Yang Xixian has achieved many achievements and honors, but he is never proud or complacent. On the contrary, he has become more modest and hardworking. He joined the Communist Party of China in November 1955, and in March of last year, he formulated a five-year plan to advance towards science, preparing to strive to become a red expert. ·Xia Shengqian·

    一位老大娘从一口猪起家
    只要提起养猪的老大娘李二女，山西省岢岚县曙光农业社的人都会说她是一个喂猪的能手。
    老大娘是从一口猪起家的。1949年冬季，她用四斗小米买了一口小母猪，每天像抚养小孩一样的饲养。小母猪长大了，第二年就生下了二十八只肥胖的小猪娃。从此，老大娘家里养的猪一年比一年增多了。每年除了出卖两窝至四窝小猪外，家里还养着好几头大猪。
    老大娘家里，在解放前经常是无柴少米的。几年来，因为她大量养猪改变了这种贫困的状况。几年来光是卖给西豹峪、阎家坪等村的仔猪就有两百多只，收入九百多元。今年养猪的收入达三百五十多元。现在，老大娘家里盖了新房子，添置了许多新的家具和衣服。她经常对人说：“听政府的话一点也没错。我要不是凭着多养猪，怎能盖新房子、添置这些东西！”她还说：今后每年要保持养一头公猪、两头肉猪、两头母猪；每年卖给国家两头肉猪。这样，她每年至少可以收入四百五十多元。所以村里人都说：“李二女真是一个喂猪模范！”

    阳希贤三年贡献大  创造十六种新农具
    湖南省沅江县南竹山乡先锋农业社社员阳希贤，从1954年以来，创造和改装了十六种新式农具。这些新农具经过有关部门技术鉴定后，大部分都在全省内进行推广。
    阳希贤是一个中级师范学校快要毕业的学生，1952年底因病回家后，就在家里安心农业生产。几年来，他用自己所学得的知识为发展农业生产作出了很大的贡献。例如他制造的积肥工具“畜力刨草器”，比人工刨草的效力提高十五倍；施肥工具“点肥器”，比用手点灰快三倍；又如在旱灾严重的时候，他又制造了一种计工准确的水车转速计，当时为农业社解决了统一车水工分的迫切问题。
    1955年，阳希贤被评为湖南省特等农具改良模范，出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。1956年由于他又创造与改进了七种农具，又被评为沅江县特等农具改良模范，再一次光荣地出席了湖南省1957年1月召开的农业劳动模范大会。年青的阳希贤得到了很多的成绩和荣誉，但他从不骄傲自满，相反地变得更加虚心和刻苦了。他在1955年11月加入了中国共产党，去年3月他制定了一个向科学进军的五年规划，准备争做取一个红色专家。　·夏胜千·
