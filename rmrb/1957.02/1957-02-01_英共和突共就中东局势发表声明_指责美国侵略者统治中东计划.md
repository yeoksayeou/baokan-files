Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th - The Political Bureau of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the Middle East situation on the 29th, opposing Eisenhower's Middle East plan. The statement pointed out that the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a plan by US imperialist elements to expand the control of oil trusts over the Middle East and impose their political rule on Arab countries.

    The statement demands: Complete opposition to Eisenhower's plan for the United States to economically and politically dominate the Middle East; unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the Gulf of Aqaba; recognition of Egyptian national sovereignty, including ownership and control of the Suez Canal; guaranteeing freedom of navigation; abolishing the Baghdad Pact and all foreign military bases and alliances in the Middle East; withdrawal of British troops from Cyprus; recognition of the Cypriot people's right to self-determination; and full development of trade relations between Arab countries and all countries on the basis of mutual benefit.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to TASS, Paris, 29th - The Political Bureau of the Tunisian Communist Party issued a statement on the US policy towards the Near East and North Africa, especially on the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine." The statement emphasized that the "Eisenhower Doctrine," under the guise of notorious economic and military "aid," primarily attempts to protect the American monopoly capital that controls 65% of the oil resources in the Middle East and Near East.

    The statement said: "According to the 'Eisenhower Doctrine,' the US government intends to provide Arab countries with economic and military assistance. In reality, this US aid, as Dulles said, is for countries that accept certain political conditions, and this aid is only a very small portion of the profits obtained by American oil companies. This aid will incite the aggressive schemes of Israel and the conspiracies of the Baghdad Pact member states."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 31st - Mubarak Zarrouk, Vice-President of the Sudanese National Union Party, said that Eisenhower's Middle East plan is to replace British and French imperialism in the Middle East. He said: "We must oppose it and resist it because we oppose any form of foreign rule."

    Zarrouk also said that his party has not yet decided on its view of the Eisenhower plan.

    英共和突共就中东局势发表声明
    指责美国侵略者统治中东计划
    新华社伦敦30日电　英国共产党政治局29日发表关于中东局势的声明，反对艾森豪威尔的中东计划。声明指出，所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”是美帝国主义分子扩大石油托辣斯对中东的控制和把它们的政治统治强加在阿拉伯国家身上的计划。
    声明要求：完全反对艾森豪威尔关于美国在经济上和政治上统治中东的计划；以色列军队无条件撤出加沙和亚喀巴湾；承认埃及的民族主权，其中包括对苏伊士运河的所有权和控制；保证自由通航；废除巴格达战争条约和外国在中东的一切军事基地和联盟；从塞浦路斯撤退英国军队；承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权；在互利的基础上充分发展阿拉伯国家和所有国家之间的贸易关系等。
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社巴黎29日讯：突尼斯共产党政治局就美国对近东和北非的政策，特别是对所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”发表了一项声明。声明强调指出，“艾森豪威尔主义”在声名狼借的经济和军事“援助”的幌子下，首先是企图保护控制了中近东65％的石油资源的美国垄断资本。
    声明中说：“美国政府根据‘艾森豪威尔主义’，打算给阿拉伯国家以经济援助和军事援助。实际上，美国的这种援助，照杜勒斯说，是给那些接受某种政治条件的国家的，而这种援助只不过是美国石油公司所获得的利润中的极少的一部分。这种援助将会煽动起以色列的侵略阴谋和巴格达条约成员国的阴谋。”
    新华社开罗31日电　苏丹民族联合党副主席穆巴拉克·查鲁克说，艾森豪威尔的中东计划是为了在中东代替英法帝国主义。他说：“我们要反对它，并且抵抗它，因为我们反对任何形式的外国统治。”
    查鲁克又说，他的党还没有决定对艾森豪威尔计划的看法。
