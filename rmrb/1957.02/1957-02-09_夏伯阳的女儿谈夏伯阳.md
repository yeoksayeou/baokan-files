Chapayev's Daughter Talks About Chapayev

Vasily Ivanovich Chapayev is a beloved hero of the Soviet people and a well-known figure to our Chinese people. This year, February 9th marks the 70th anniversary of his birth. In recent days, the Chapayev Museum on Second Pichata Street in Pugachev City, Saratov Oblast, Russian Federation, has seen an especially large number of visitors. People have been visiting Chapayev's daughter, Klavdiya Vasilyevna, to reminisce with her about this legendary hero who lives forever in the hearts of the Soviet people. On February 3rd, the "Soviet Russia" newspaper published an interview by Kornilov with Chapayev's daughter.

In a room adorned with portraits of Chapayev, a middle-aged woman with a gentle and kind face calmly recounted some stories about her father.

She said that her family was a large one. Her grandfather, Ivan Stepanovich, her uncle, Grigory, and her father, Chapayev, all earned their living as carpenters, building houses, repairing farm tools, and even building churches on one occasion.

She said that her father had been working since he was a teenager, so he disliked loafers and lazy people the most. She recalled that one morning, during the Civil War, her father returned home. The children rushed to embrace him, and then sat down at the table to eat breakfast. Chapayev's face changed slightly, and he said to her mother:

"What, do you want to raise some aristocratic offspring?" Then he said to the children:

"Before eating, you should do some work, even if it's just a little bit, like wiping the floor, chopping some firewood for the samovar..."

Next, Klavdiya Vasilyevna recounted some stories about Chapayev when he was commanding Red Army troops. At that time, when they lived in Pugachev, their house always had many guests, all of whom were soldiers and commanders from the "Chapayev Division." Another spacious, well-lit room served as a field hospital. Many people who were injured in battles with the White bandits came here for treatment. The whole family did everything they could to take care of them. On one occasion, Chapayev was injured. This is how he was injured: he was traveling in a car when he saw a disabled man without legs sitting on the side of the road. When this man saw Chapayev, he shouted, "Come over here, Vasily Ivanovich!" The car drove over, and the driver wanted to help the man into the car, but Chapayev pushed the driver away and personally got out of the car to help the disabled man. Unexpectedly, as Chapayev went to help the man, he was violently struck with a heavy metal bar. It turned out that this fellow was a reactionary kulak. Chapayev stayed home to recover from his injuries for some time before returning to the front lines.

Klavdiya Vasilyevna said that even in the most difficult years of the struggle, Chapayev was very concerned about the children's learning and education. She remembered that at one point her grades were not very good. One evening, Chapayev picked her up and said:

"Not long ago, the Filin father and son, who were recovering from their injuries in our house, sacrificed themselves in battle. Their heroic fighting was for the sake of you children being able to live happily and study well..."

Klavdiya Vasilyevna also talked about herself and her brothers. Chapayev's eldest son, Alexander Vasilyevich, is now a colonel of artillery, and his youngest son, Arkady, was a pilot who sacrificed himself in 1939 while on a mission. She herself graduated from the Senior Party School and worked in the Party organs before retiring for health reasons in 1948. (Zhang) (With photos)

    夏伯阳的女儿谈夏伯阳
    瓦西里·伊凡诺维奇·夏伯阳是苏联人民热爱的英雄，也是我们中国人民很熟悉的人物。今年2月9日是他诞生七十周年纪念日。这几天来，俄罗斯联邦萨拉托夫州普加乔夫城第二皮查塔雅大街夏伯阳博物馆的参观者特别多起来了，人们访问了夏伯阳的女儿克拉芙季·瓦西里耶夫娜，同她一起回忆这位永远活在苏联人民心中的传奇式的英雄。2月3日“苏维埃俄罗斯报”刊载了科尔尼洛访问夏伯阳女儿的一篇谈话。
    在一间悬挂夏伯阳肖像的房子里，一位有着温柔、善良面孔的中年女人从容不迫地讲着她的父亲夏伯阳的一些故事。
    她说，她家是一个大家庭，她的祖父伊凡·斯捷潘诺维奇、她的伯父格里戈里以及她的父亲夏伯阳都是靠着给人家做木工为生的，他们建筑房子、修理农具，有一次还修建过教堂。
    她说，她父亲从少年时代起就劳动，因此最不喜欢二流子和懒汉。她记得，还是在内战时期的一个早晨，她父亲回到家里来，孩子们一下子都拥上去，同他拥抱以后，就坐在饭桌旁边吃早饭。夏伯阳的脸色有点变了，他对她母亲说：
    “怎么，你想培养一些贵族子弟吗？”然后他对孩子们说：
    “在吃饭以前应当做一些哪怕是小小的劳动，像擦擦地板，为水火壶劈点劈柴……。”
    接着，克拉芙季·瓦西里耶夫娜讲述夏伯阳在指挥红军部队时的一些故事。当时他们住在普加乔夫时，家里总是有很多客人，都是些“夏伯阳部队”里的战士和指挥官。另一间宽敞、光线充足的房间作战地医院。许多在同白匪分子作战中受伤的人都来这里治疗。全家都尽一切力量来看护他们。有一次夏伯阳受伤了。他是这样受伤的：他坐着小汽车出行，路边上坐着一个没有脚的残废人。这个人看到夏伯阳以后就喊道：“开这边来，瓦西里·伊凡诺维奇！”车开过去后，司机想扶这个人上车，可是，夏伯阳把司机推开，亲自下车来帮助这个残废人。不料当夏伯阳去扶这个人的时候，竟被这个人用很重的金属杆猛力痛击。原来，这家伙是一个反动富农。夏伯阳在家里养一些时候伤以后又回到前线上去。
    克拉芙季·瓦西里耶夫娜说，就是在斗争最艰难的岁月中，夏伯阳也是非常关心孩子们的学习和教育的。她记得，有一个时期她的功课不太好，一天晚上夏伯阳把她抱起来以后说：
    “不久以前在我们家里养伤的费林父子在战斗中牺牲了。他们的英勇作战就是为了你们孩子们能够幸福地生活，能够很好地学习……。”
    克拉芙季·瓦西里耶夫娜还谈到她自己和她的弟兄。夏伯阳的大儿子亚历山大·瓦西里耶维奇现在是炮兵上校，小儿子阿尔卡季曾经是飞行员，1939年为执行任务而牺牲，她自己在高级党校毕业后，曾在党的机关中工作，1948年因病休养。　（章）（附图片）
