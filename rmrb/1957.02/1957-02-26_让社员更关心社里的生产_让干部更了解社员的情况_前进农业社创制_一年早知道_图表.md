Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan. Recently, in the homes of every member of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, a "One Year in Advance" chart has been posted on the wall. This chart was created by the cooperative's management committee based on the cooperative's production plan for the year, the total annual income and expenditure of agriculture and sideline occupations, the distribution budget, and each member household's annual labor input, standard investment, and family sideline production income. From the chart, members can see the cooperative's and their own estimated labor input for the year, various income and expenses, and the main methods for achieving this year's production plan.

From the "One Year in Advance" chart, cooperative cadres saw that the income of twelve households, including Zhang Jintang's, might decrease according to the budget. They actively helped them develop family sideline occupations, with each household raising one more pig, striving not to reduce their income this year. According to the budget, the income of one hundred and seventy-one households, including Li Danhai's, would increase this year compared to last year. They are determined to increase their income more than originally planned and strive to become depositors in the cooperative after the autumn harvest.

Sixty percent of the cooperative's members have already held family meetings, formulating family labor income and expenditure plans based on the cooperative's "One Year in Advance." Li Huasheng's family of six specifically studied the division of labor, ensuring timely attendance, and working more labor days at the family meeting. The "One Year in Advance" chart indicates that his family's income can increase by more than 130 yuan this year.

Currently, 97% of the cooperative's male and female workforce has participated in intense preparations for spring plowing, with an attendance rate 25% higher than originally planned.

The Rural Work Department of the Xiangyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that this chart of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative is a new creation in the cooperative's planned management work and has notified all cooperatives to study and imitate it. (Attached chart)

    让社员更关心社里的生产　让干部更了解社员的情况
    前进农业社创制“一年早知道”图表
    新华社太原电　最近，在山西省襄垣县城关乡前进农业社的每个社员家里，墙上都贴了一张“一年早知道”的图表。这种图表是社管理委员会根据全社今年的生产计划，全年农副业总收入、总支出、分配预算和各户社员全年劳动投工数、标准投资、家庭副业生产收入制定的。社员们从图表上可以看出全社和自己的全年预计投入劳动工数、各项收支和实现今年生产计划的主要办法。
    社干部从“一年早知道”的图表上看出社员张锦堂等十二户，按照预算的结果可能减少收入，便积极帮助他们发展家庭副业，每户多养了一口猪，争取今年不减少收入。社员李旦孩等一百七十一户按照预算，今年可比去年增加收入，他们决心要比原计划增加更多的收入，争取秋收后成为社里的存款户。
    全社已有60％的社员召开了家庭会议，根据社里的“一年早知道”，订出家庭劳动收支计划。社员李花生全家有六口人，在家庭会议上具体研究了劳动分工、保证按时出勤和多做劳动日的问题。“一年早知道”图表上标明：他家今年可增加收入一百三十多元。
    目前，全社已有97％的男女劳动力，参加了紧张的备耕活动，出勤率比原计划提高了25％。
    中共襄垣县委员会农村工作部认为前进农业社的这种图表是农业社计划管理工作的新创造，现已通报各社研究仿效。（附图表）
