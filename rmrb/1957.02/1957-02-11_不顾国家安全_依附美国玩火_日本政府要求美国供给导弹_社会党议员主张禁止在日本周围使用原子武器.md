Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Japanese Defense Agency Director General Akira Kotaki admitted yesterday at the House of Representatives Budget Committee that Japan is studying poison gas and germ warfare. He described this behavior as "defensive." He also revealed that Japan has requested the United States to supply seven types of missiles in the 1956 fiscal year for "research and experimentation."

Socialist Party member of the House of Representatives, Isamu Imasumi's sharp questioning at yesterday's Budget Committee forced Akira Kotaki to reveal these activities of the Japanese military. Isamu Imasumi also revealed that there are twenty-four American radar bases in Japan, and Japan's airspace is completely under the control of the United States Air Force.

Isamu Imasumi advocated that, in addition to Japan signing an agreement with the United States that atomic weapons would not be brought into Japan without consultation with Japan, it should go a step further and sign agreements with countries including the Soviet Union and China to prohibit the use of atomic weapons around Japan.

Isamu Imasumi also questioned the Japanese government's "two Chinas" foreign policy. Japanese Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi replied that the Japanese government recognizes the Chiang Kai-shek group as the "legitimate government of China." At the same time, he said that "the fact" that the government of the People's Republic of China actually exists "cannot be denied." Nobusuke Kishi said that, according to this situation, Japan mainly establishes economic and trade relations with China and implements individual cultural exchanges. He also said that this is a natural trend.

    不顾国家安全　依附美国玩火
    日本政府要求美国供给导弹
    社会党议员主张禁止在日本周围使用原子武器
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本防卫厅长官小泷彬昨天在众议院预算委员会上承认，日本正在研究毒气和细菌战。他把这种行为说成是“防御性”的。他同时还透露，日本已经要求美国在1956年度供给七种导弹来进行“研究和实验”。
    社会党众议员今澄勇昨天在预算委员会的尖锐质询，迫使小泷彬透露出日本军方这些活动。今澄勇并且揭露，日本国内有二十四个美国雷达基地，日本的领空也完全处于美国空军管制之下。
    今澄勇主张，在日本要同美国签订不同日本协商就不把原子武器运进日本的协定的想法之外，还应该更前进一步，应当同包括苏联和中国在内的国家签订协定，禁止在日本周围使用原子武器。
    今澄勇并且对日本政府的“两个中国”的外交方针提出了质询。日本外务相岸信介回答说，日本政府承认蒋介石集团为“正统的中国政府”。他同时说，中华人民共和国政府实际上存在着的“这个事实是不能加以否认的”。岸信介说，根据这种情况，日本主要地是同中国建立经济贸易关系，实行个别的文化交流。他还说这是自然趋势。
