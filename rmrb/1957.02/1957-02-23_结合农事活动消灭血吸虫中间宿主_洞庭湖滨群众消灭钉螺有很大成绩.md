The Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province has launched a mass campaign to eliminate the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, the Oncomelania hupensis snail, by combining it with agricultural activities such as water conservancy construction, land reclamation, plowing, and fertilizer accumulation during the past winter and this spring, and has achieved great results.
Currently, eighteen counties and cities in the Changde and Xiangtan prefectures along the Dongting Lake and the lower reaches of the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers have generally carried out snail elimination work on an area of more than 422,000 mu. According to inspections, the general snail elimination rate is 70% to 80%. Eighteen townships with prevalent schistosomiasis have basically eliminated snails and become "snail-free townships." It is estimated that by this winter, another mass snail elimination campaign will be carried out in conjunction with water conservancy construction, reclamation, and fertilizer accumulation, and about sixty "snail-free townships" may appear in the schistosomiasis-prone areas of the province, completely eliminating snails in 27% of the schistosomiasis-prone townships.
This snail elimination campaign began in November last year. At the construction sites of dikes and embankments, in conjunction with repairing dikes and organizing drainage and irrigation systems, methods such as soil burial, digging new ditches, and filling old ditches were used to eliminate snails in an area of more than 20,000 mu. In conjunction with winter production, more than 130,000 mu were used to eliminate snails by plowing, hoeing grass, and accumulating fertilizer. More than 260,000 mu were used to eliminate snails by burning on the Great Wilderness Island.
According to the recent Fourth Hunan Provincial Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Work Conference, in addition to continuing to combine various agricultural activities to basically eliminate snails on an area of more than 600,000 mu this year, Hunan Province will also treat 75,000 patients with schistosomiasis this year.

    结合农事活动消灭血吸虫中间宿主
    洞庭湖滨群众消灭钉螺有很大成绩
    新华社长沙讯　湖南省洞庭湖滨地区去冬今春结合修水利、围垦翻耕、积肥等农事活动开展群众性的消灭血吸虫中间宿主钉螺的运动，收到很大成效。
    目前，常德和湘潭两专区沿洞庭湖滨和湘、资、沅、澧四水尾闾地区的十八个县、市，已经在四十二万二千多亩的面积上，普遍进行了一次消灭钉螺工作。据检查，一般的灭螺率达70％到80％，有十八个血吸虫病流行的乡已经基本上消灭了钉螺，成为“无螺乡”。预计到今年冬季结合修水利、开垦、积肥再来一次群众性的灭螺运动，全省血吸虫病流行地区内便可能出现六十个左右的“无螺乡”，在27％的血吸虫病流行的乡内完全消灭钉螺。
    这次灭螺运动是从去年11月间开始的。在修整堤垸的工地，结合修堤整理排灌系统，采用土埋、开新沟、填旧沟等办法，灭螺的面积有两万多亩。结合冬季生产，用翻耕、铲草积肥等办法灭螺的有十三万多亩。在大荒洲上用火烧办法灭螺的有二十六万多亩。
    根据最近召开的湖南省第四次血吸虫病防治工作会议决定：湖南省今年除了继续结合各项农事活动要在六十多万亩面积上基本消灭钉螺外，还将在今年内治疗血吸虫病人七万五千人。
