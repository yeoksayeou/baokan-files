Don't Discard Our Good Traditions
	Song Zheng
	The cadres dispatched by Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, to the countryside mostly "eat, live, and labor together" with the masses, carefully listen to their opinions, and earnestly help them solve problems. The masses welcome them very much, saying, "The good cadres like those in the land reform are back!"

	"The good cadres like those in the land reform are back!" What a touching and thought-provoking sentence. From this sentence, we can keenly feel how the peasant masses are cherishing our good traditions and good style of deeply mobilizing the masses and sharing weal and woe with them during the land reform. After the land reform, many cadres maintained and carried forward the good tradition of going deep among the masses and sharing weal and woe with them. The majority of comrades dispatched by Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, to the countryside, as well as Comrade Jiang Zihe, Deputy Secretary of the Changli County Party Committee in Hebei Province, and Comrade Zhou Benshun, an official of the Wangcheng County government in Hunan Province, introduced in the following two articles, are such cadres. However, some comrades feel that the current situation is different from the past, and that the style of land reform is outdated and no longer needed today. Therefore, they feel at ease in discarding the good traditions of our Party of hard work and plain living and close ties with the masses. Some people even go down to the countryside at most to the township people's committees, or at most to the commune offices, and are no longer willing to go to the fields or the homes of farmers to have heart-to-heart talks with them. They sit in their offices, calling this person today to report on their work, and calling that person tomorrow to reflect on the situation. Finally, they convene everyone for a meeting to assign tasks, or to offer a pile of criticisms of past work. They dislike farmers for being dirty and are unwilling to get closer to them, so naturally there is no talk of sharing weal and woe. If the cadres during the land reform were heart-to-heart with the farmers, as close as family, now the hearts of these comrades are far away from the farmers, and they even put on "official" airs in front of the masses. The Jiujiang Special Zone First Group of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee's rural work team is the most concentrated representative of these comrades. I am afraid that concepts such as "going deep among the masses" and "caring about the suffering of the masses" are no longer in the minds of these comrades. It is difficult to say what they are going to the countryside for. People have every reason to suspect that they are going to the countryside merely to obey orders and take a walk, without the sincerity and determination to solve some problems for the grassroots organizations and the masses.

	The situation is indeed different. But does the new situation after collectivization mean that we no longer need to carry forward the good traditions of the Party's mass line? The farmers of Ningxiang County have already answered this question very well. It should be said that the problem is not that the situation has changed, but that the thinking of some comrades has changed: after the victory of the revolution, they began to covet ease and pursue enjoyment, thus forgetting the suffering of the masses and losing the noble enthusiasm of the past for hard work and plain living and everything for the interests of the masses. And these comrades dare not openly reveal their true feelings, so they find various excuses to cover themselves up. In fact, no matter what excuse they find, it is in vain, because it cannot stand the test of the masses. One sentence from the farmers of Ningxiang County can expose all kinds of excuses.

### 不要丢掉我们的好传统

    不要丢掉我们的好传统	宋琤
    湖南宁乡县派到农村去的干部，大多和群众“同吃、同住、同劳动”，细心倾听群众的意见，认真帮助群众解决问题。群众非常欢迎他们，说是：“像土地改革中那样的好干部又来啦！”
    “像土地改革中那样的好干部又来啦”，这句话多么动人，多么发人深思。从这句话中，我们可以亲切地感受到农民群众是怎样在怀念着我们在土地改革中那种深入发动群众和群众同甘共苦的好传统、好作风。土地改革以后，很多干部保持并且发扬了深入群众和群众同甘共苦的好传统，湖南宁乡县派到农村的大多数同志以及下面两篇文章中介绍的河北昌黎县委副书记江子贺同志和湖南望城县机关干部周本顺同志就是这样的干部。但是，也有些同志觉得现在的情况和过去不同了，土地改革时的那种作风在今天已经过时了不再需要了，因此，他们也就心安理得地丢掉了我们党的艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的好传统。甚至有些人下乡至多下到乡人民委员会，至多是社办公室，不再愿意到田间、到农民家里，和农民一起谈知心话了。他们坐在办公室里，今天叫这个来汇报工作，明天叫那个来反映情况，最后是召集大家开会布置任务，或者对过去的工作提出一堆批评。他们嫌农民脏，而不愿更多地接近农民，自然也就谈不到同甘共苦了。如果说土地改革时的干部和农民是心连心，是亲如家人；现在，这些同志的心已经和农民离得远远的，甚至向群众摆起“官”架子来。江西省委下乡工作组九江专区第一小组就是这些同志的最集中的代表。恐怕这些同志的脑子里已经不再有“深入群众”、“关心群众疾苦”之类的概念了。很难说他们下乡到底是为了什么，人们完全有理由怀疑他们下乡仅仅只是奉了命令下去走一遭，而并没有诚意和决心替基层组织和群众解决一些问题。
    情况的确是不同了。但是，是不是合作化以后的新情况就不再需要我们发扬党的群众路线的好传统了？宁乡县的农民已经很好地回答了这个问题。应该说问题不在于情况发生了变化，而是有些同志的思想发生了变化：他们在革命胜利以后，开始贪图安逸追求享受，因而忘掉了群众的疾苦，失掉了过去那种艰苦朴素一切为了群众利益的崇高的热情。而这些同志又不敢公然把自己的真正的心事公之于众，于是就找出这种那种借口为自己打掩护。其实，不管找什么借口都是徒劳的，因为它经不住群众的考验，宁乡县农民的一句话，就可以揭穿各种借口。
