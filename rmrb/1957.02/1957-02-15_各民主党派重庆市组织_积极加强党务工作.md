Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 13th: Chongqing municipal organizations of various democratic parties, in light of the new situation following organizational development and increased workload, are actively strengthening party affairs work and the education of new members.

Since the second half of last year, the local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing have developed more than a thousand new members, and various tasks have been very active. In order to improve democratic life, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, among other units, are further strengthening collective leadership and establishing relevant systems such as criticism and self-criticism. The chairman and vice-chairmen of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association also hold regular meetings to study important association affairs. Recently, they also held a forum for full-time cadres to encourage cadres to offer opinions on leadership work. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, in response to the weakness of collective leadership in the past, has decided to discuss how to improve the system of collective leadership and division of responsibility at the committee meeting to be held in mid-February, and will also establish a standing committee and various working committees.

The municipal-level leading institutions of the various democratic parties have also improved and strengthened their leadership over grassroots organizations. Branches and groups have been established in most areas and units where there were no grassroots organizations before. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has also sent veteran members to the newly established branches to guide and assist in their work. The three branches of the Chongqing Branch of the Jiusan Society in Chongqing University, Southwest Normal College, and other universities have successively re-elected their committees, increasing the number of members to enhance the collective leadership of the branches. The municipal-level institutions of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang have adopted the method of liaison officers, assigning a group of full-time cadres to be responsible for the liaison work of one or several branches. Liaison officers often go deep into grassroots organizations to understand the situation and participate in the meetings of grassroots organizations. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League has also mobilized grassroots organizations to conduct investigations on issues such as "marching toward science" and "problems existing among intellectuals in universities and colleges." The municipal-level leading institutions of the various democratic parties also improve the professional level of the staff of the grassroots organizations by holding professional meetings on propaganda, organizational work, and other topics. After the municipal organizations of the various democratic parties in Chongqing established and improved grassroots organizations, the activities of each grassroots organization have increased, and members of the various democratic parties have regular organizational lives.

Strengthening the education of new members is one of the important activities of the various democratic parties during this period. The Chongqing municipal leading institutions of the various democratic parties are formulating or have already formulated plans to strengthen the education of new members, in order to improve the ideological awareness of new members and promote their more active participation in the socialist construction of the motherland. Many grassroots organizations of the various democratic parties have also universally conducted education on united front work for new members.

    各民主党派重庆市组织
    积极加强党务工作
    新华社重庆13日电　各民主党派在重庆市的地方组织针对组织发展和工作增多后的新情况，积极加强党务工作和对新成员的教育工作。
    去年下半年以来，各民主党派在重庆市地方组织共发展了一千多个新的成员，各项工作都很活跃。为了健全民主生活，中国民主建国会重庆市委员会和中国民主同盟重庆市委员会等单位正进一步加强集体领导，建立批评与自我批评等有关制度。民建重庆市委员会主任委员和副主任委员还定期举行碰头会，研究较重大的会务工作。最近他们并召开了专职干部座谈会，发动干部对领导工作提意见。民盟重庆市委员会针对过去集体领导工作薄弱的情况，决定在2月中旬召开的委员会议上讨论如何健全集体领导与分工负责的制度，同时将成立常务委员会及各个工作委员会。
    各民主党派市级的领导机构还改进和加强了对基层组织的领导，在以前没有基层组织的地区和单位中，大部建立了支部和小组。中国国民党革命委员会重庆市委员会还派出老的成员到新成立的支部去指导和帮助工作。九三学社重庆分社在重庆大学、西南师范学院等高等学校的三个支社，已先后改选委员会，增加了委员名额，以增强支社的集体领导。中国农工民主党、民建、民革等市级机构采用联络员的办法，指定一批专职干部分别负责一个或几个支部的联络工作。联络员经常深入基层组织了解情况，参加基层组织的会议。民盟重庆市委员会还发动基层组织进行关于“向科学进军”、“高等学校知识分子中存在的问题”等问题的调查。各民主党派市级领导机构也通过召开宣传、组织工作等专业会议，来提高基层组织的工作人员的业务水平。各民主党派重庆市地方组织建立并健全基层组织后，各个基层组织的活动已经增多，各民主党派的成员都有了定期的组织生活。
    加强对新成员的教育，是这个时期各民主党派的重要活动之一。各民主党派重庆市领导机构正在制订或已经制订关于加强新成员教育的计划，以提高新成员的思想觉悟，推动他们更加积极地参加祖国社会主义建设。各民主党派的许多基层组织还普遍向新成员进行了统战工作的教育。
