Xinhua News Agency, February 14th. In order to vigorously develop wool production, increase the income of farmers and herdsmen, and at the same time, integrate the state's wool procurement plan more closely with agricultural and pastoral production to ensure the source of goods needed by the state, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has decided to pre-purchase wool in fifteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide this year. The total value of pre-purchases will increase by 1.4 times compared to last year. To this end, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued a notice on the pre-purchase of wool in 1957 to its affiliated units in early February.

The areas designated for pre-purchase of wool this year include: Beijing Municipality, Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Other provinces and municipalities do not carry out wool pre-purchases because production is scattered and sporadic. The types of wool to be pre-purchased include: sheep wool, goat wool, cashmere, camel hair, and cattle hair. These varieties are all commodities that are in great demand for both domestic and foreign sales, but among them, cashmere and cattle hair are not yet commonly produced in many areas. Therefore, the notice particularly emphasized the need to strengthen publicity among the masses about the significance and methods of wool production through pre-purchase work, in order to promote the universal practice of shearing wool and prevent waste of resources.

Regarding the target of wool pre-purchases, the notice stipulates: Pre-purchases should be conducted for agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers and herdsmen who raise livestock. When conducting pre-purchases, for wool produced by livestock collectively raised by agricultural and pastoral cooperatives (teams), privately owned and publicly raised, and privately owned and privately raised by cooperative (team) members, a contract should be signed with the consent of the cooperative members to pre-purchase at the same time; for wool from individual farmers and herdsmen, a contract should be signed with the head of the household, who is responsible for completing the pre-sale task. For wool produced by state-owned farms and production units, credit pre-purchases will be conducted, and no deposit will be paid.

The notice points out: The proportion of the pre-purchase deposit to be issued is 25% of the total pre-purchase value, which will be issued in one lump sum when the contract is signed. The time for returning the deposit can be determined according to the specific circumstances, and it can be returned in one lump sum or in installments when the wool is delivered. Regarding the price of pre-purchased wool, it is stipulated that it should be calculated according to the state's purchase price at the time of local pre-purchase. In order to guarantee the interests of farmers and herdsmen in selling wool, it is also stipulated that if the price fluctuates at the time of delivery, the price at the time of delivery will be used, following increases but not decreases.

In order to ensure that the pre-purchase work is done well, the notice requires local supply and marketing cooperatives to carefully ascertain the production situation and ensure that the quantity of pre-purchased wool is arranged on a reliable basis. Sufficient wool must be left for the masses' necessary self-use. When determining the time and place of delivery, the conditions for farmers and herdsmen to sell should be fully considered, and convenience should be provided. The notice also requires relevant leading departments in various localities to conduct a review after the contract signing and deposit disbursement work is completed. If, during the review, it is found that the pre-purchase quantity is not realistic, adjustments should be made according to the specific circumstances.

    使国家采购计划密切结合农牧业生产
    全国供销合作总社决定预购绒毛
    在全国十五个省、市、自治区实行
    新华社14日讯　全国供销合作总社为了大力发展绒毛生产，增加农、牧民收入，同时使国家采购绒毛的计划与农牧业生产更密切结合，以保证国家需要的货源，决定今年在全国十五个省、市、自治区预购绒毛。预购总值比去年增加一点四倍。供销合作总社为此在2月上旬向所属单位发出了关于1957年预购绒毛的通知。
    今年确定预购绒毛的地区有：北京市、河北、山西、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、陕西、甘肃、青海、山东、河南、四川、云南等省和内蒙古自治区、新疆维吾尔自治区。其他省、市因为生产零星分散，不进行绒毛预购。预购绒毛的品种有：绵羊毛、山羊毛、山羊绒、驼毛、牛毛等五种。这些品种都是内外销十分需要的商品，但是其中山羊绒和牛毛在很多地区群众还没有生产习惯。因此，通知中特别强调要通过预购工作，加强向群众宣传生产绒毛的意义和方法，以促进普遍抓剪绒毛，防止货源的浪费。
    关于预购绒毛的对象，通知中规定：对农牧业社、互助组以及个体农牧民，凡饲养有牲畜者进行预购。在进行预购时，对牲畜由农牧业社（组）集体饲养和私有公养以及社（组）员私有私养所生产的绒毛，应由生产社（组）征得社员同意，签订一个合同同时预购；对个体农牧民的绒毛，则与户主签订合同，由户主负责完成预售任务。对国营农牧场和生产部队所产的绒毛，进行信用预购，不付定金。
    通知指出：预购定金发放的比例，为预购总值的25％，在签订合同时一次发放。归还定金的时间可根据具体情况，在交售绒毛时一次或分批归还。关于预购绒毛的价格，规定按当地预购时国家的收购牌价计算。为了保证农牧民出售绒毛的利益，同时也规定了如果在交售绒毛时价格有所涨落，则交售时作价，随涨不随落。
    为了保证把预购工作作好，通知中要求各地供销社要认真摸清生产情况，一定要把预购绒毛的数量安排在可靠的基础上。对群众必需留作自用的绒毛要留够。在确定交货的时间和地点上，应该充分考虑农牧民出售的条件，给予便利。通知还要求各地有关领导部门在签订合同发放定金工作结束后，进行复查工作。在复查工作中，如发现预购数量有不切合实际的地方，应根据具体情况进行调整。
