Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The agricultural labor model representatives attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Conference today held professional symposiums to exchange advanced production experiences from various regions.

The symposiums were conducted simultaneously in thirty-six specialized groups, including rice, wheat, cotton, oil crops, pig raising, state-owned farms, pastures, and aquaculture. At the symposiums of each specialized group, the representatives reported very rich and comprehensive experience in increasing production. Twenty-two representatives from fifteen provinces and cities, including Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Shanghai, specifically introduced their cultivation techniques in creating high-yield experience, large-area high-yield experience, changing single-season rice to double-season rice, intercropping rice to continuous cropping rice, as well as rice close planting and rational irrigation in their speeches in the rice group. Among them, Ding Man, director of the Qinlao Agricultural Cooperative in Fumin County, Yunnan Province, introduced their experience of achieving a large-area high yield of an average output of 1,093 jin per mu on more than 1,700 mu of single-season rice last year; Tan Changren, director of the Dabao Township Agricultural Cooperative in Qiongdong County, Guangdong Province, introduced their experience of achieving a high yield record of an average of more than 2,550 jin per mu on more than three mu of double-season rice last year; and Lin Shaohe, director of the Gonghe Agricultural Cooperative in Fushun County, Sichuan Province, introduced their successful experience in labor arrangement, which was particularly valued by the representatives.

At the symposium of the cotton group, representatives from cotton-producing provinces and regions such as Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hubei, in addition to exchanging advanced cotton cultivation techniques, also reported the experience of cotton-wheat double cropping and cotton-vegetable three crops a year. Representatives participating in the symposiums of other groups also spoke enthusiastically.

The symposiums on state-owned farms, pastures, and aquaculture were presided over by the Ministry of Land Reclamation and the Ministry of Aquatic Products. At these symposiums, the representatives also fully exchanged experiences in the production and construction of state-owned farms, pastures, and fisheries.

Through this technical exchange meeting of various specialties, the representatives have greatly increased their confidence in doing a better job in future production and construction. Xu Fengqian, director of the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Jianhu County, Jiangsu Province, said that with the guidance of the advanced experience learned this time, they will be able to increase the average yield of the expanded 500 mu of double-season rice this year to 800 jin to 1,000 jin. Xu Deming, director of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Xiajin County, Shandong Province, also confidently stated that the average yield of cotton per mu in the whole cooperative should strive to reach 300 jin (seed cotton) this year, and 16 mu of them should reach 1,000 jin.

Tonight, Fang Fang, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, also invited labor model representatives from overseas Chinese hometowns in Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces to hold a symposium.

    交流各地先进生产经验
    新华社24日讯　出席全国农业劳动模范会议的全体代表今天分别举行专业座谈会，交流各地的先进生产经验。
    座谈会是分水稻、小麦、棉花、油料、养猪、国营农场、牧场和水产等三十六个专业小组同时进行的。在各个专业小组的座谈会上，代表们报告的增产经验都非常丰富和全面。湖南、湖北、安徽、广东、云南和上海等十五个省、市的二十二个代表，在水稻组的发言中具体地介绍了他们在创造高额丰产经验、大面积丰产经验和单季稻改双季稻、间作稻改连作稻以及水稻密植、合理灌溉等方面的栽培技术经验。其中云南省富民县勤劳农业社主任丁满介绍他们去年一千七百多亩单季稻平均产量达一千零九十三斤的大面积高额丰产经验，广东省琼东县大保乡农业社主任谭昌任介绍他们去年有三亩多双季稻平均每亩产二千五百五十多斤的高产纪录的经验，以及四川省富顺县共和农业社主任林少和介绍他们在劳力安排方面的成功经验，特别受到代表们的重视。
    在棉花组的座谈会上，山东、山西、陕西、湖北等棉产省、区的代表们，除交流了棉花的先进栽培技术外，还报告了棉、麦两熟和棉花、蔬菜一年三熟的经验。参加其他各个小组座谈的代表，发言也很热烈。
    国营农场、牧场和水产专业座谈会是由农垦部和水产部主持的。在这些座谈会上，代表们也充分交流了国营农场、牧场和渔业生产建设方面的经验。
    通过这次各专业的技术交流会，使代表们对进一步做好今后的生产建设工作增加了很大信心。江苏省建湖县红旗农业社主任徐风乾说，有了这次学到的先进经验的指导，他们今年将扩大的五百亩双季稻，平均产量一定能够提高到八百斤到一千斤。山东省夏津县前进农业社主任许德明也满有信心地表示，今年全社每亩棉田的平均产量要争取达到三百斤（籽棉），其中有十六亩要达到一千斤。
    今天晚上，华侨事务委员会副主任方方还邀请来自广东、福建等省侨乡的劳动模范代表举行了座谈会。
