    Carry Forward the Experience of the Party's Rectification and Study
    Qiang Xiaochu, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CCP

    In 1942, our Party carried out a rectification movement of great historical significance. This was the largest Marxist-Leninist ideological movement since the founding of the Party. Through this movement, the Marxist-Leninist level of our Party was greatly improved, making our Party a politically mature party and an organizationally more united party, thereby enabling the Party to lead the people of the whole country to win a great victory in the revolution.

    Comrades who participated in this rectification movement and comrades who have seriously studied the history of the Party all clearly know that before the rectification, our Party was already a well-tested and powerful party. However, because our Party was long surrounded by a vast petty bourgeoisie, and a large number of new Party members came from this class, they always "demanded that people transform the Party and transform the world according to the face of petty-bourgeois intellectuals." Many Party members and some leading cadres within the Party did not know or were not good at mastering dialectical materialism and historical materialism, but instead used subjectivist methods manifested as dogmatism and empiricism to deal with revolutionary issues. This was the ideological root cause of the "left" or right opportunist errors committed by some comrades in the Party's history. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong called dogmatism and empiricism unscientific and anti-Marxist-Leninist ways of thinking, "a manifestation of impure Party spirit," "a great enemy of the working class," and "it is necessary to overthrow it." It was in response to this situation that the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, proposed launching a rectification movement, calling on the entire Party to carry out a struggle against non-proletarian ideology within the Party, to overcome the petty-bourgeois ideological style widely existing in the Party, that is, to overcome subjectivism in study style, sectarianism in Party style, and the expression of these two tendencies—Party jargon in writing style, thereby establishing the Party's Marxist-Leninist way of thinking. This is the primary problem that must be solved in Party building. Facts have proved that the rectification movement basically achieved this goal, and on this basis, in the winter of 1943, the Party Central Committee organized senior cadres to study the Party's line, and for the first time, in a relatively concentrated and systematic way, criticized the errors of "left" and right opportunism ideologically with Marxism-Leninism, creating ideological and organizational conditions for the Party's Seventh National Congress and the subsequent victory of the revolution. That is to say, the significance of this rectification movement is extremely far-reaching.

    However, with the growth and development of our Party's organization, many new Party members do not understand or do not understand much about the rectification movement. Some old Party members, due to their lack of deep understanding of the Party's historical experience or forgetting the Party's valuable historical experience, have insufficient understanding of the harm of subjectivism, sectarianism, and Party jargon to the Party's cause. Some problems that were criticized and resolved in the rectification movement have now grown and developed again among some cadres of the Party and the state. Therefore, revisiting and carrying forward the Party's rectification and study experience of fifteen years ago is of great practical significance.

    The Party Central Committee has always attached importance to this experience. In recent years, the Party Central Committee has decided that cadres with conditions should study materialism to overcome subjectivism; in June last year, it also notified all Party members at or above the level of county party secretary, students in senior and intermediate Party schools, researchers in philosophy, social science, and natural science research institutions, and graduating students in universities to study "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Oppose Party Jargon," "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party," and "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and other five documents to further improve the Marxist-Leninist level of Party and state cadres and ensure the victorious progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation. The Party's Eighth National Congress, in view of the fact that nine-tenths of our Party members joined the Party after the Seventh National Congress, emphasized the practical significance of the basic experience of how the correct line in the Party's history effectively overcame the erroneous line. In Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, it was pointed out: "We are now facing new conditions and new tasks, and we must solve many problems that are more complex and unfamiliar than in the past. Under these circumstances, if we do not strive to improve our Marxist-Leninist consciousness, do not strive to learn new knowledge and delve into new business, but are satisfied with praising the victory, subjectivist errors will inevitably develop. At the same time, the large number of new Party members who have joined our Party have not received enough Marxist-Leninist training and can easily become a market for subjectivism and dogmatism." In response to this situation, the "Eighth National Congress" resolution put forward the task of overcoming subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism. All of these are based on the new tasks of the new historical period, requiring our vast number of Party members, especially senior Party cadres, to be good at using the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method to summarize the experience in struggle, adhere to the truth, and correct mistakes. Therefore, strengthening the study of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and conducting a rectification of the work style of all Party members at regular intervals is precisely for this purpose. The Party's historical experience fully demonstrates that overcoming subjectivism in thought and improving the ability to distinguish between right and wrong within the Party is the fundamental key to ensuring the smooth development of the Party's work and avoiding major errors.

    Judging from the situation in our Heilongjiang Province, the series of instructions and measures of the Party Central Committee are completely correct. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, we have organized the study of philosophy, social sciences, and various businesses according to the level of Party members and cadres; used cadre schools, training classes, and organized on-the-job cadres to conduct ideological rectification work of varying degrees in combination with their work, such as overcoming bourgeois ideology in the "Three-Anti" movement, opposing right-leaning paralysis in the early stage of the "Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries" movement, eliminating the influence of Gao Gang, that is, bourgeois influence, in the entire Party, especially among senior cadres, combating right-leaning conservative ideology and the mood of impetuousness and rash advance in socialist transformation and socialist construction, as well as the struggle against bureaucraticism, commandism, and individualism, etc., which greatly improved the enthusiasm of the vast number of Party members and cadres for learning, and the ideological style of Party members and cadres has also improved a lot. Our province's Party organizations have implemented the Central Committee's line and policies, and have basically completed the tasks given by the Party and the people. This must be affirmed. However, as pointed out in the "Eighth National Congress" resolution: There are still many shortcomings in our work. The most fundamental of these shortcomings is that in the thinking and work of many cadres of the Party, they have not yet gotten rid of subjectivism. In our social life in the future, the ideology of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie will continue to exist for a long time, and in socialist construction, we will often face many new problems and tasks that are completely unfamiliar to us. If we are influenced by non-proletarian ideas, become arrogant and complacent, and do not study diligently, then we cannot avoid the harm of subjectivism. Therefore, in order to maintain the correct and sound leadership of our Party, overcome the subjectivity and one-sidedness of cadres' thinking, and carry out our socialist cause better and more effectively, we must overcome subjectivism in practical work, that is, dogmatism and empiricism, overcome the tendency of dogmatism in learning Marxism-Leninism and foreign experience, and overcome dogmatism and Party jargon in academic research, newspaper propaganda, teaching work. Only in this way can we make fewer mistakes and avoid serious mistakes.

    In recent years, the more prominent problem in the ideological style of cadres in our Heilongjiang Province is the inability to closely combine the Party's policies and guidelines with the specific conditions of this region and this unit, that is, the inability to use the principle of combining theory with practice, acting solely on subjective wishes and enthusiasm, seeing one side of the problem while ignoring the other, grasping the point of the matter while abandoning the whole matter. As a result, things went against their wishes, and the subjective and objective went in opposite directions, causing a lot of damage to the work. For example, the right-leaning conservative thinking once manifested in socialist transformation and the blind mood of partiality, impatience, and greed for greatness manifested after correcting these thoughts is a clear fact. This fact shows that: first, due to insufficient understanding of the Party's leadership ability, the socialist consciousness and enthusiasm of the masses, the need for production development to change the old relations of production in a timely manner, and the need to liberate and develop the productive forces, the non-mainstream problems in the work were excessively emphasized, coupled with the influence of the erroneous idea of "resolutely contracting" and "quickly dismounting," thus showing a right-leaning idea of being afraid of tigers in front and wolves behind, hindering the normal development of socialist transformation; but after criticizing this right-leaning conservative thinking, some cadres did not fully understand the Party's policies, did not grasp the law of work development, and therefore one-sidedly believed that the faster and larger it was, the better it was, and the more superior it was. As a result, some enterprises (especially service enterprises) that were currently suitable for decentralized operation were forcibly merged, and joint ventures and handicraft production cooperatives were prematurely emphasized to share profits and losses together. Some agricultural cooperatives were too large, and the scope of public ownership was not moderate enough. In particular, there were some phenomena of excessive and hasty construction plans, which not only put the work in a passive position, but also affected production to a certain extent. In other aspects, such as emphasizing active development while ignoring a fully reliable foundation, emphasizing steady progress while ignoring mobilizing all positive factors for possible development, as well as in completing plans and ensuring quality, estimating achievements and shortcomings, analyzing the main and secondary aspects of problems, implementing collective leadership and individual responsibility, democracy and centralism, the whole and the part, the collective and the individual, unity and struggle, etc., there were more or less similar manifestations of subjectivism. The bureaucraticism in leadership style, the sectarianism in Party relations and in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, the dogmatism in learning, and the Party jargon in propaganda, cultural and educational work, and art, which we usually talk about, are all manifestations of subjectivism from the perspective of their way of thinking. What we often see is the generality in implementing the Party's policies and guidelines, the failure to conduct in-depth, detailed, and systematic investigations and research, so that the Party's policies cannot be implemented through the mass line, and the inability to have a comprehensive view of the overall situation to guide the work forward, etc., which is precisely the bureaucratic leadership style under the control of the subjectivist way of thinking; in Party relations, the discrimination between relatives and strangers, mutual cover-up, and retaliation (although individual) and in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, the lack of importance of the opinions of non-Party personnel and the inability to cooperate (also a minority), etc., is precisely the sectarian emotion under the control of the subjectivist way of thinking; in teaching and learning, the rote memorization, the simple citing of classics, the failure to connect with the current situation in our country, the failure to connect with personal thoughts and work, emphasizing the so-called "pure theoretical learning," going from books to books (rather than to practice), the lack of understanding of current domestic and foreign events, let alone using theory to explain and explain them, the mechanical application in the study of foreign experience, such as one-sidedly emphasizing the "one-leader system" without considering the time, place, and conditions and abandoning our Party's long-standing and effective leadership system that combines collective leadership and individual responsibility, etc., is precisely the dogmatic study style under the control of the subjectivist way of thinking; in our certain instructions and newspapers, periodicals, and dramas, the empty talk, the enumeration of phenomena, the old formulas, the lack of analysis, the lack of characteristics, the lack of edges and corners, the lack of vividness and imagery, the inability to see the struggle and development of things, etc., is precisely the Party jargon in writing style under the control of the subjectivist way of thinking; in our some cadres, the personal interests are opposed to the interests of the Party, such as paying attention to personal gains and losses, lacking a sense of career, paying attention to ostentation and comparing extravagance, and some people's misunderstanding of the Hungarian incident, distinguishing between the enemy and us or blurring the line between the enemy and us, and in the domestic market supply problem, confusing the temporary difficulties in today's progress with the suffering of the people in the old society. Some people even spread bad influence among the masses, and some people oppose "free discussion," "democracy," and "letting a hundred flowers bloom" to the Party's leadership, not wanting or even opposing the Party's leadership, etc., which is precisely the manifestation of one-sidedness and superficiality under the control of the subjectivist way of thinking. In short, all these are the manifestations of idealism or unconscious idealism in our actual work and in the thinking of some cadres, and the metaphysical viewpoints and methods of things arising from this. Although many of our comrades do not admit idealism and metaphysics in words, in fact, they often work according to idealistic and metaphysical viewpoints and methods. Naturally, they only ignore the comprehensiveness of objective things and their internal connections, rather than intentionally denying its existence. Therefore, its manifestation, in work and study, is either starting from books and documents, or starting from narrow experience, without considering the specific situation, and without analyzing the changed time, place, and conditions; in thought, it is swaying and wandering, often following the wind, being a member of the east wind when the east wind comes, and a member of the west wind when the west wind comes. This is the main problem in the thinking, learning, and work of our cadres at present, and it is a problem that must be resolutely overcome in socialist construction.

    The fundamental way to solve the above problems is to further strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Comrade Mao Zedong's works by cadres, first of all, the study of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and constantly rectify the ideological style of Party and state cadres to meet the needs of the rapid development of the socialist cause. It is very important to revisit and carry forward the Party's rectification and study experience here. Rectification and study is to achieve the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. Here, it must be affirmed first that it is completely wrong to ignore or not attach importance to the study of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, because this may lead to falling into the quagmire of empiricism or revisionism; but on the other hand, the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism must be combined with specific practice, otherwise, it will fall into dogmatism. The experience of rectification and study tells us that the study of theory (including classical works, rectification documents, and Party instructions, etc.) must be combined with practice (including the history of the Party, current work, and personal thoughts and work, etc.). For this reason, we must first earnestly study Marxist-Leninist theory and Comrade Mao Zedong's works, understand the spirit and essence of theoretical works and documents, and then use them as weapons to analyze and solve practical problems; secondly, we must conduct profound self-reflection based on our own history, thoughts, and work, and cooperate with comrades' criticism and assistance, commend achievements, criticize shortcomings and errors, summarize experience, and draw lessons, so that every comrade can consciously "adhere to the truth and correct mistakes" with the help of the Party. Facts have proved that this method is necessary and effective. In the past study in connection with Party history, the "left" and right opportunist lines that had occurred in the Party's history were thoroughly cleared up, especially the "left" line represented by Comrade Wang Ming during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, which had the longest period of rule in the Party and the greatest harm to the Party, so that the entire Party could distinguish between true and false Marxism and unite more closely around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, effectively overcome the three evil winds of subjectivism (dogmatism, empiricism), sectarianism, and Party jargon, and ensure the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Democratic Revolution. The rectification emphasized that people with book knowledge should develop towards practical aspects, and people with practical work experience should learn towards theoretical aspects; pointed out the exclusiveness of sectarianism within the Party and the exclusiveness in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, correctly corrected the "mountain stronghold mentality" tendency, and emphasized the Party's united front policy; forcefully criticized the "empty talk and meaningless" and the crime of glib-tongued Party jargon, emphasized "shooting the arrow at the target," "seeking truth from facts," and the lively and fresh Marxist-Leninist writing style; strongly criticized the petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness of liberalism, egalitarianism, and making independence, and strengthened the ideological leadership of the proletariat; emphasized "no investigation, no right to speak" and the leadership style of going deep into reality and implementing the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," "concentrating and persisting." In a word, it criticized idealism, learned materialism, improved the ideological awareness of cadres, and learned what Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "Smell everything with your nose, discern its good and bad, and then decide to welcome it or resist it," "absolutely should not blindly follow, absolutely should not advocate slave mentality." All of this is undoubtedly completely applicable to our current work and study, especially to overcome subjectivism, bureaucraticism, and sectarianism in our current work.

    Rectification and study is a self-education method using Marxism-Leninism, a reflective learning method, and a very good learning method created in the rectification movement. Challenging the "old self" ideology, making strict review and struggle against the "old self," is impossible without the determination to transform oneself, but people are able to do this and have done it, because the purpose of the Party's rectification movement is: "Learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, cure the sickness to save the patient," and is both serious and cautious about problems within the Party, "both clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades," and never like the so-called "cruel struggle, merciless打击" of opportunists. Undoubtedly, this is also fully applicable now.

    Some people think that the experience of rectification and study is only applicable to the past or only applicable to large movements, which is incomplete and incorrect. As long as it is admitted that rectification and study is a method of self-education, then it should be affirmed that the Party's rectification and study experience is both suitable for that time and applicable to the present; it is suitable for large-scale Party rectification movements, and also suitable for small-scale rectification of cadres' ideological style; it is suitable for cadres in school, and also suitable for on-the-job cadres; it is suitable for collective learning, and also suitable for individual self-study. Some comrades also regard the rectification and study experience as only needed for senior cadres, and it seems that it has nothing to do with general cadres, which is also incorrect. Because the requirement of linking theory with practice and the method of self-education are necessary for any cadre and Party member. Although senior cadres should pay special attention to this experience, since general cadres have always received less training, therefore, in this sense, self-education is even more necessary for them, and the rectification and study experience is even more useful for them. Therefore, today, on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the rectification movement, in all our theoretical, scientific, business, and current study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents, we should further attach importance to and carry forward the Party's rectification and study experience, continuously improve the level of Marxism-Leninism, continue to overcome the manifestations of idealism within the Party and the remnants of various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological consciousness, improve our Party politically and organizationally, and fight victoriously for the cause of socialism and communism.

    发扬党的整风学习的经验
    中共黑龙江省委书记　强晓初
    1942年，我们党进行了一次具有巨大历史意义的整风运动，这是建党以来最大的一次马克思列宁主义思想运动。通过这次运动，使我们党的马克思列宁主义水平大大地提高了一步，使我们党成为政治上成熟的党，组织上更加团结一致的党，因而党领导全国人民赢得了革命的伟大的胜利。
    凡参加过这次整风运动的同志和认真学习过党的历史的同志，都可以清楚地知道，在整风以前，我们党已经就是一个久经锻炼的强大的党。但是由于我们党长期处在广大小资产阶级的包围中，有很大数量的新党员又来自这个阶级，他们总是“要求人们按照小资产阶级知识分子的面貌来改造党，改造世界”，有许多党员和党内的一些领导干部，还不会或不善于掌握辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义，而是以表现为教条主义与经验主义的主观主义方法来处理革命问题，而这正是党的历史上一部分同志所以犯“左”的或右的机会主义错误的思想根源；所以，毛泽东同志把教条主义和经验主义叫做反科学反马克思列宁主义的思想方法，“是党性不纯的一种表现”，“是工人阶级的大敌”，“有打倒它的必要”。以毛泽东同志为首的党中央就是针对这种情况，提出开展整风运动，号召全党进行反对党内非无产阶级思想的斗争，以克服广泛存在于党内的小资产阶级思想作风，也就是克服学风中的主观主义、党风中的宗派主义和这两种倾向的表现形式——文风中的党八股，从而建立党的马克思列宁主义的思想方法。这是党的建设中必须解决的首要问题。事实证明，整风运动基本上达到了这个目的，并在此基础上于1943年冬，党中央组织高级干部进行了党的路线的学习，第一次比较集中、系统地以马克思列宁主义从思想上批判了“左”、右倾机会主义的错误，为党的第七次全国代表大会及以后的革命的胜利创造了思想的和组织的条件。这就是说：这次整风运动的意义是极其深远的。
    但是，随着我们党的组织的壮大与发展，许多新党员不了解或不大了解整风运动，有些老党员也由于对于党的历史经验领会不深刻或者忘记了我党这些宝贵的历史经验，对于主观主义、宗派主义及党八股对党的事业的危害性认识不足，若干在整风运动中曾经批判过和解决了的问题，现在在党和国家的某些干部中又有所滋长和发展了。因此，重温并发扬十五年前党的整风学习经验是极有现实意义的。
    党中央始终是重视这个经验的，就近年来说：党中央曾决定有条件的干部学习唯物主义以克服主观主义；去年6月又通知在全党相当于县委书记一级以上干部中，在高、中级党校学员中，在哲学、社会科学和自然科学研究机关的研究人员中，在高等学校毕业班学生中，学习“改造我们的学习”、“整顿党的作风”、“反对党八股”、“关于若干历史问题的决议”及“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”等五个文件，以进一步提高党和国家干部的马克思列宁主义水平，保证社会主义建设与社会主义改造事业的胜利进行；党的第八次全国代表大会又鉴于目前我们党员中十分之九都是第七次代表大会以后入党的这一情况，强调了党的历史上正确路线怎样有效地克服错误路线的基本经验的现实意义。在刘少奇同志的政治报告中指出：“我们现在面对着新的条件和新的任务，我们必须解决许多比过去更为复杂的和不熟悉的问题。在这种情况下，如果我们不努力提高马克思列宁主义的觉悟水平，不努力学习新的知识，钻研新的业务，而满足于对胜利的一片赞扬，主观主义的错误就必然会发展起来。同时，加入我们党的大批新党员，还没有受到足够的马克思列宁主义的锻炼，也很容易成为主观主义、教条主义的市场。”针对着这种情况，在“八大”决议中提出克服主观主义、官僚主义与宗派主义的任务。所有这些，都是根据新的历史时期的新的任务，要求我们广大党员首先是党的高级干部，能够善于运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法去总结斗争中的经验，坚持真理，修正错误。所以要加强辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的学习和每隔一定时期对全体党员进行一次工作作风的整顿，正是为了这个目的。党的历史经验充分地说明，克服思想上的主观主义，提高党内是非的辨别能力，是保证党的工作顺利发展和避免重大错误的根本关键。
    从我们黑龙江省的情况来看，党中央的这一系列的指示和措施是完全正确的。在中央的正确领导下，我们曾根据党员、干部的水平，分别组织了哲学、社会科学与各种业务的学习；利用干部学校、训练班和以一定时间组织在职干部结合工作进行过多次程度不同的整顿思想作风的工作，如“三反”运动中克服资产阶级思想，“镇反”运动初期反右倾麻痹思想，在全党特别是高级干部中肃清高岗影响即资产阶级影响，在社会主义改造与社会主义建设中反右倾保守思想和急躁冒进情绪，以及反官僚主义、命令主义和个人主义思想的斗争等等，使广大党员、干部的学习积极性，较前有了很大的提高，党员、干部的思想作风也有许多改善。我省党的组织执行了中央的路线、政策，基本上完成了党和人民所给予的任务。这是必须肯定的。但是正如“八大”决议中所指出的：我们的工作还有许多缺点，这些缺点中最根本的，就是在党的许多干部的思想和工作中，还没有摆脱主观主义。今后在我们的社会生活中，资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想仍将长期残存着，而且在社会主义建设中，我们将经常面对着许多对于我们完全生疏的新的问题和工作。如果我们沾染了非无产阶级思想的影响，骄傲自满，自以为是，不虚心学习，那么我们就不能避免主观主义的危害。因此，为了保持我们党的正确的、健全的领导，克服干部思想上的主观性和片面性，把我们的社会主义事业进行得更好和更有效，就必须克服实际工作中的主观主义，即教条主义和经验主义，克服学习马克思列宁主义和外国经验中的教条主义倾向，克服学术研究、报刊宣传、教学工作中的教条主义和党八股的现象。只有这样，我们才能够少犯错误和不犯严重错误。
    近年来，在我们黑龙江省干部的思想作风中，比较突出的问题就是不善于把党的方针、政策和本地区、本单位的具体情况密切地结合起来，也就是不善于运用理论与实际结合的原则，单凭主观愿望与热情办事，看到了问题的一面，忽视了另一面，抓住了事物的一点，放弃了事物的全面，结果事与愿违，使主观与客观背道而驰，给工作带来了许多的损害。例如在社会主义改造中一度表现的右倾保守思想和在纠正这些思想后所表现的某些脱离实际情况的偏急贪大的盲目情绪，就是一个明显的事实。这个事实说明：先是由于对党的领导能力、群众的社会主义觉悟和积极性、生产发展要求及时改变旧的生产关系、解放和发展生产力的需要等认识不足，过分地强调了工作中的非主流的问题，加之“坚决收缩”、“赶快下马”的错误思想的影响，因而表现了前怕龙后怕虎，裹足不前的右倾思想，影响了社会主义改造事业的正常发展；但是在批判了这种右倾保守思想以后，有些干部又没有全面领会党的政策，没有掌握住工作发展的规律，因而片面地认为越快越大就越好，就越有优越性，结果生硬地合并了一些目前适于分散经营的企业（特别是服务性的企业），对某些合营企业与手工业生产合作社过早地强调了共负盈亏，有些农业合作社偏大了一些，公有化的范围有些不够适度，特别是建设的计划上有些过大过急的现象发生，不但使工作处于被动，而且也使生产受到了一定的影响。其他如强调了积极发展就忽视了充分可靠的基础、强调了稳步前进又忽视了调动一切积极因素进行可能的发展，以及在完成计划与保证质量、估计成绩与缺点、分析问题的主要方面与次要方面、实行集体领导与个人负责、民主与集中、整体与局部、集体与个人、团结与斗争等等方面，程度不同的都有类似的主观主义的表现。我们通常所说的领导作风上的官僚主义，党内关系及党与非党关系上的宗派主义，学习上的教条主义，宣传、文教工作和艺术上的党八股等等，从其思想方法来说，都是主观主义的。我们经常看到的执行党的方针、政策上的一般化，不进行深入细致的系统的调查研究，因而使党的政策不能通过群众路线去贯彻，不能通观全局，指导工作前进等，正是主观主义的思想方法支配下的官僚主义领导作风；在党内关系上那种分亲论疏，互相包庇，打击报复（虽然是个别的）以及在党与非党关系上不重视非党人员的意见，不善于合作共事（也是少数的）等，正是主观主义思想方法支配下的宗派主义情绪；在教学与学习上的照本宣科，单纯引经据典，不联系当前我国的实际，不联系个人的思想与工作，强调所谓“纯理论学习”，从书本中来到书本中去（而不是到实际中去），对当前国内外事件则不甚了解，更不能用理论加以阐述说明，对外国经验的学习中的生搬硬套，比如不考虑时间、地点、条件的片面强调“一长制”而抛弃了我党长期以来行之有效的集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度等，正是主观主义思想方法支配下的教条主义学风；在我们的某些指示及报纸、刊物和戏剧上所表现的空话连篇，现象罗列，陈旧公式，缺乏分析，没有特点、没有棱角，不生动、不形象，看不出事物的斗争和发展等等，正是主观主义思想方法支配下的文风中的党八股；在我们一些干部中所表现的把个人利益与党的利益对立起来，如计较个人得失、缺乏事业心、讲排场比阔气，和有的人在对匈牙利事件的认识上敌我不分或者敌我界线模糊，在对国内市场供应问题上把今天前进中的暂时的困难与旧社会人民的困苦混为一谈，有的人甚至在群众中散布不良影响，有的人把“自由讨论”、“民主”、“百家争鸣”与党的领导对立起来，不要甚至反对党的领导等等，正是主观主义思想方法支配下的片面性和表面性的表现。总之，所有这些也就是我们实际工作中和一部分干部思想中的唯心主义或不自觉的唯心主义以及由此而产生的对事物的形而上学的观点和方法的表现。尽管我们许多同志在口头上并不承认唯心主义和形而上学，可是事实上他们却是往往按照唯心主义的和形而上学的观点与方法去工作。自然他们还只是忽视了客观事物的全面性及其内部的联系，而不是有意的不承认它的存在。所以其表现形式，在工作与学习上或者是从书本、文件出发，或者是从狭隘经验出发，不去考虑具体情况，不分析已经变化了的时间、地点、条件；在思想上则是左右摇摆和徘徊，常常随风倒，东风来了是东风派，西风来了是西风派。这是我们目前干部思想、学习与工作中的主要问题，是社会主义建设中必须坚决克服的问题。
    解决上述问题的根本方法，就是进一步加强干部的马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志著作的学习，首先是辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的学习，不断地整顿党和国家干部的思想作风，以适应社会主义事业迅速发展的需要。这里重温并发扬党的整风学习经验是十分重要的。整风学习，就是要达到马克思主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合，在这里首先必须肯定，忽视或不重视学习马克思列宁主义的普遍真理是完全错误的，因为这样就有可能堕入经验主义或修正主义的泥坑；但另一方面，马克思列宁主义的普遍真理又必须与具体实践相结合，否则就会陷于教条主义。整风学习的经验告诉我们，学习理论（包括经典著作、整风文件与党的指示等）必须与实际（包括党的历史，当前工作与个人的思想与工作等）相结合。为此，就必须首先认真学习马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东同志的著作，领会理论著作及文件的精神和实质，然后作为武器用以分析和解决实际问题；其次要切实根据自己的历史、思想和工作进行深刻的自我反省，并配合以同志的批评帮助，表扬成绩，批评缺点和错误，总结经验，提出教训，使每一个同志都能在党的帮助下自觉地“坚持真理，修正错误”。事实证明，这种方法是必要的和有效的。在过去联系党史的学习中，彻底地清算了党的历史上曾经发生过的“左”右倾机会主义路线，特别是清算了第二次国内革命战争时期以王明同志为代表的、在党内统治时间最长、对党危害最大的“左”倾路线，使全党分清了真假马克思主义，更加紧密地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的周围，有效地克服了主观主义（教条主义、经验主义）、宗派主义与党八股这三股歪风，保证了抗日战争与人民民主革命的胜利。整风中强调了有书本知识的人要向实际方面发展，有实际工作经验的人要向理论方面学习；指出了宗派主义在党内的排内性和在党与非党之间关系上的排外性，正确的纠正了“山头主义”倾向，强调了党的统一战线政策；有力地批判“空话连篇，言之无物”与哗众取宠的八股罪状，强调了“有的放矢”、“实事求是”与活泼新鲜的马克思列宁主义文风；强烈地批判了自由主义、平均主义、闹独立性等小资产阶级的思想意识，加强了无产阶级的思想领导；强调了“没有调查就没有发言权”以及深入实际，贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”，“集中起来，坚持下去”的群众路线的领导作风。一句话，批判了唯心主义，学习了唯物主义，提高了干部的思想觉悟，学会了毛泽东同志所指示的：“对于任何东西都用鼻子嗅一嗅，鉴别其好坏，然后才决定欢迎它，或者抵制它”，“绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义”。这一切无疑地对于我们现在的工作与学习，尤其是克服目前工作中的主观主义、官僚主义与宗派主义，是完全适用的。
    整风学习，是一种以马克思列宁主义进行自我教育的、反省的学习方法，是在整风运动中创造出的一种很好的学习方法。向“旧我”思想挑战，向“旧我”作严格的审查和斗争，没有自我改造的决心是不行的，但是人们又能够这样作而且作到了这一点，就是因为党的整风运动的宗旨是：“惩前毖后，治病救人”，对党内问题既严肃又慎重，“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”，绝不像机会主义者那样所谓“残酷斗争，无情打击”。无疑的，这也是完全适用于现在的。
    有些人认为整风学习经验仅仅适用于过去或者仅仅适用于大的运动，是不全面与不正确的。只要承认整风学习是自我教育的方法，那末就应该肯定党的整风学习经验既适合于当时，也适用于现在；既适用于大规模的整党运动，也适用于小规模的整顿干部的思想作风；既适用于在学干部，也适用于在职干部；既适用于集体学习，也适用于个人自修。还有些同志把整风学习经验只看作是对高级干部需要的，似乎对于一般干部没有关系，这也是不正确的。因为理论联系实际的要求和自我教育的方法，对于任何干部和党员都是必要的。固然高级干部应该特别重视这个经验，但由于一般干部受到的锻炼总还是少一些，因而在这个意义上说，自我教育也就对他们更需要，整风学习经验也就对他们更有用。因此，在纪念整风运动十五周年的今天，我们在一切理论、科学、业务及目前对“八大”文件的学习中，应该进一步重视和发扬党的整风学习经验，不断地提高马克思列宁主义水平，继续克服党内的唯心主义表现与各种资产阶级及小资产阶级思想意识的残余，从政治上与组织上提高我们的党，为社会主义和共产主义事业而胜利地战斗下去。
