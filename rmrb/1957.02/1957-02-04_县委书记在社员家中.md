    County Party Secretary at a Commune Member's Home
            By our reporter Zhu Bo
    On the first day of the Spring Festival, just as dawn broke, the sky over the Xianyang Plain was filled with goose feather-like snowflakes.
    The commune members of the Shuguang Second Advanced Agricultural Cooperative looked at the sky with pleasure, truly a lucky snow foretelling a bumper year! But they also anxiously watched the road leading to the county town, because Xu Tingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Xianyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Mi Zhenmin, a member of the County Committee, were coming to celebrate the Spring Festival with the commune members. With such heavy snow and such muddy roads, would they still come? People braved the snow and walked back and forth on the east side of the village. After a while, on the road in the southeast corner, several black dots appeared in the vast expanse of snowflakes. People jumped up happily, "They're here, it's them!" People stepped through the snow to greet them.
    The commune members all rushed to shake hands with the guests, greeting each other, "It must have been cold on the road in such heavy snow!" Deputy Secretary Xu replied, "Not cold, I was even sweating!" Gao Congshan, an elderly commune member in his sixties, squeezed forward and said to County Committee member Mi Zhenmin, "Old Mi, we have a saying on the Plain, if you have a happy first day of the New Year, you'll have a happy year." Comrade Mi Zhenmin asked him with a smile, "How about it, do you feel happy?" "That goes without saying, just look and you'll know!" The old man replied happily. People chatted and laughed, and they crowded around the guests as they walked into a newly cleaned-up venue for a get-together.
    The get-together program began, with singing, Qin腔 opera, and various dances. Applause and laughter constantly rang out in the venue. At this moment, someone suddenly shouted, "Welcome Deputy Secretary Xu and Comrade Mi to dance!" Everyone also applauded in welcome. Comrade Mi Zhenmin said with a smile, "I can't dance, but I can play the drum. Let me play a set to substitute!" When the old man Gao Congshan heard that Old Mi was going to play the drum, he also approached with a smile. He was an old man in the Tongle (shared happiness) group and played the drum best. When people saw him coming, they shouted excitedly, "The old master is here, let him play a set with Comrade Mi." They played a set of drumbeats that were most familiar to the people on the Plain, and also the most inspiring.
    After the get-together, the guests went to the homes of the commune members. At the home of commune member Gao Keyou, Old Xu bowed his hands as he entered the door and said, "Happy New Year!" Gao Keyou replied happily, "It's a good one. I have lived for decades and have never had such a good Spring Festival as this year. It's all thanks to the advanced cooperative. Last year was the first year of the advanced cooperative and we had a great harvest. We can't even finish eating the grain we got, so how could the Spring Festival not be good?" Gao Keyou made everyone laugh when he said that. "A bumper harvest is a bumper harvest, but we must pay attention to thrift!" "Deputy Secretary Xu, rest assured, the cooperative called for thrift before the Spring Festival, and every family in the village will save at least half the money compared to previous years. Take my family as an example. We originally planned to spend more than twenty yuan for this Spring Festival, but now ten yuan is enough." He paused and continued, "Whether the Spring Festival is good or not does not depend on how much money is spent, as long as the whole family feels happy. What's the point of buying more things if you don't have a good time?" According to the cooperative director Gao Buying, this is indeed the way the cooperative has been doing things. All 84 households in the cooperative are like this, and they are reluctant to eat even after a bumper harvest. This year, the whole village saved more than one hundred yuan on wine alone. Some people who used to buy three catties of wine now only buy one catty. In the past, the whole village would slaughter dozens of pigs, but this year the whole village only slaughtered seven or eight pigs. The commune members all know that last year's harvest was good, and this year they should be frugal, save money, and strive for an even greater harvest. The old man Gao Congshan also added, "This year people's hearts have changed. In the past, when you met someone, you would ask how much meat you cut and how many catties of wine you prepared for the festival; this year, people sit together and say, how many workdays do you plan to earn this year?" Gao Keyou continued, "More work, more pay, how can we not plan? Last year, our family earned more than 420 workdays, and this year we plan to earn 500 workdays."
    At the home of Gao Shanfu, a man with the "five guarantees" (food, clothing, medical care, housing, and burial expenses), the seventy-five-year-old Gao Shanfu and his old wife were preparing to make *shaozi* noodles, which is a custom of the people on the Plain, eating dumplings early in the morning before dawn and *shaozi* noodles at noon. The two old people felt Deputy Secretary Xu's clothes, afraid that he was cold, and kept urging him to sit on the heated *kang* (platform bed). Deputy Secretary Xu asked them about their Spring Festival and how the cooperative was taking care of them. The old man smiled and said repeatedly, "All is well! All is well!" This year, the cooperative gave Gao Shanfu's family 1,200 catties of wheat, and also gave him more than ten yuan for the Spring Festival. Gao Shanfu did not spend all this money, he only spent a few yuan, and the rest was deposited in the credit cooperative. Others advised him, "You are old, eat something good!" He replied, "Old age does not mean we should waste money. Everyone is saving, and I cannot be an exception. This money is all cooperative property, and spending less is always good for the cooperative." Old man Gao Shanfu has worked as a farmer all his life. Although he is now under the "five guarantees," he still often goes to the fields and to the breeding room to take a look. When he encounters light work that he can do, he helps out.
    When Deputy Secretary Xu asked him if there would be a good harvest this year, he replied, "Yes, 'eight, ten, three, rains for wheat (rains in August, October, and March),' this year's wheat meets this saying, there will definitely be a good harvest." As he said this, he stared at the cotton-like snowflakes flying in the sky outside, probably the old man was thinking about the scene of a great harvest this year!…

    县委书记在社员家中
            本报记者　朱波
    春节第一天，天刚亮，咸阳塬上的上空，就飞舞着鹅毛似的雪花。
    曙光第二高级农业社的社员以愉快的心情来望着天空，这真是瑞雪兆丰年呀！但是，他们又以焦急的心情注视着通往县城的那条公路，因为中共咸阳县委的许廷芳副书记和县委委员米振民今天要和社员们一起欢度春节。这么大的雪，这么泥泞的路，他们还会不会来？人们冒着雪在村东边转来转去。一会儿，在东南角的路上，在白茫茫的雪花中出现了几个黑点，人们高兴地跳起来了，“来了，是他们！”人们踏着雪迎上前去。
    社员们都抢着和客人握手，互相问候着，“这么大的雪，路上冷吧！”许副书记回答说：“不冷，还出汗哪！”六十多岁的老社员高从善挤上前去，对县委委员米振民说：“老米，咱们塬上有句话，初一这天过得愉快，一年四季都会愉快。”米振民同志笑着问他：“怎么样，你感到过得愉快不？”“那还用问，看看不就知道了！”老人高兴地回答说。人们说笑着，簇拥着客人走进一个刚刚打扫出来的联欢会的会场上。
    联欢的节目开始了，有歌唱，有秦腔，还有各种舞蹈。会场上不断响起掌声和笑声。这时，不知是谁突然喊了一声：“欢迎许副书记和米同志跳舞！”大家也都随着鼓掌欢迎。米振民同志笑着说：“我不会跳舞，我会打鼓，打一套来代替吧！”高从善老汉一听说老米要打鼓，也微笑着凑过来了，他是同乐班里的老人，打鼓打得最好。人们看见他走过来，又兴奋地喊着：“老把式来了，和米同志一起打一套。”他们打了一套塬上人们最熟悉的，也是最能振奋人心的鼓点。
    联欢完后，客人又分别到社员家里去了。在社员高克友家里，老许进门就拱着手说：“年过得好！”高克友愉快地回答说：“过得好，活了几十岁还没有过过像今年这样好的春节，这全要靠高级社啊，去年高级社第一年就大丰收了，分的粮食都吃不完，你说春节还能过不好？”高克友把大家都问笑了。“丰收是丰收，可要注意节约呀！”“许副书记放心吧，在过春节前，社里就号召节约了，全村每家少说也要比往年节省一半钱。就说我家吧，原来计划过这个春节要花费二十多元，现在只用了十几元就够了。”他停了停又说：“春节过得好坏，不在花钱多少，只要过得全家心里都愉快就行了，买的东西再多，过得不顺心有什么好呢。”据社主任高步瀛说，这个社的确是这样作的，全社八十四户社员都是这样，丰收了倒舍不得吃了。今年全村光酒就节省了一百多元，有人往年打三斤酒，今年只打一斤，过去全村要杀几十口猪，而今年全村只杀了七、八口猪。社员们都知道去年丰收了，今年还要省吃俭用，节省下钱来争取更大的丰收。高从善老汉也随着说：“今年人心都变了，往年见了面都是问割了多少肉，装了几斤酒过节；今年，人们坐在一起都是说，你计划今年挣多少劳动日？”高克友接着说：“多劳多得嘛，不计划怎么行呢？去年我们全家挣了四百二十多个劳动日，今年就打算挣到五百个劳动日。”
    在五保户高善福家里，七十五岁的高善福和他的老伴正准备做稍子面，这是塬上人们的习惯，早晨天不明就吃饺子，中午就吃稍子面。两个老人摸了摸许副书记的衣服，恐怕他冷，一直催他到烧热了的炕上去坐。许副书记问他们过春节的情况，和社里对他们照顾的情况。老人笑着连说：“都很好！都很好！”今年社里给了高善福家一千二百斤麦子，过春节时又给了他十几块钱。高善福并没有把这些钱花费了，他只用了几块钱，其余的都存在信用社里了。别人劝他说：“你年纪大啦，吃点好的吧！”他回答说：“年纪大了也不应浪费呀，别人都节约，我也不能例外。这钱都是社里的财产，少花费点对社里总有好处。”高善福老人做了一辈子庄稼活，现在虽然是五保户，他还是经常到地里，到饲养室里看一看。碰上能干的轻活就帮帮忙。
    当许副书记问他今年能不能丰收时，他回答说：“能，麦收八、十、三、场雨（八月十月三月各一场雨），今年的麦子正合上这句话，一定能丰收。”说到这里，他就注视着外面天空中飞舞着的棉絮般的雪花，大概是老人家正在想着今年大丰收的景象吧！……
