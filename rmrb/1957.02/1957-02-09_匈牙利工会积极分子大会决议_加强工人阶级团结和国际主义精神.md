    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: According to TASS, the Hungarian Trade Union activists held a congress on the 6th in the Chepel Iron and Steel Plant. The attendees passed a resolution on further strengthening the unity of the Hungarian working class and proletarian internationalism.
    The Deputy General Secretary of the Central Council of the Hungarian Free Trade Union Federation, Mr. Ferk, delivered a report at the meeting on the current problems of the Hungarian trade union movement. He pointed out that clarifying the trade union's view of the October events is of particular importance for achieving trade union unity. He said that the struggle waged by the working class during the October events was not against the system or the dictatorship of the proletariat, but to eliminate harmful and incorrect methods and to consolidate the Hungarian workers' regime and people's democracy. The working class will not abandon the fruits of their victories over the past twelve years in the slightest.
    Mr. Ferk said that despite the enormous losses suffered by the country due to the counter-revolution, amounting to 12 to 14 billion forints, the government has still done a lot to improve the living standards of the working people. For example, in terms of wage adjustments, the initial plan stipulated 550 million forints, but now the government has allocated more than 2.8 billion forints for it.
    Mr. Ferk finally pointed out that the Hungarian trade union, as in the past, remains a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and it hopes to establish contacts with trade unions of all countries.
    Mr. Frachon, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labour, and Mr. Luchesi, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke at the conference.

    匈牙利工会积极分子大会决议
    加强工人阶级团结和国际主义精神
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社报道：匈牙利工会积极分子6日在切佩尔钢铁厂举行大会，到会者通过了关于进一步加强匈牙利工人阶级的团结和无产阶级国际主义的决议。
    匈牙利自由工会全国联合会中央理事会副总书记弗克在会上作了关于当前匈牙利工会运动的问题的报告。他指出，澄清工会对十月事件的看法对实现工会的团结有特别重要的意义。他说，工人阶级在十月事件期间所作的斗争，并不是反对制度，也不是反对无产阶级专政，而是为了消除有害的和不正确的方法，巩固匈牙利工人政权和人民民主。工人阶级丝毫也不会放弃十二年来他们取得的胜利果实。
    弗克说，尽管反革命使国家遭受了一百二十至一百四十亿福林的巨大损失，但是政府仍旧做了很多事情来提高劳动人民的生活水平。例如，在调整工资问题方面，最初计划规定为五亿五千万福林，而现在政府已经为它拨出了二十八亿多福林。
    弗克最后指出，匈牙利工会和过去一样仍然是世界工会联合会的会员，它希望同所有国家的工会建立联系。
    在大会上讲话的还有法国总工会总书记弗拉商和世界工联副主席卢切西。
