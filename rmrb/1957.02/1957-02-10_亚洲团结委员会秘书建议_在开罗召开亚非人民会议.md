Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 9th: The Secretary of the Asian Solidarity Committee, Indian Member of Parliament Dr. Anup Singh, said at a press conference here on the evening of the 8th that if the Egyptian government and people welcome it, the Asian Solidarity Committee hopes to hold an Afro-Asian People's Conference in Cairo.

Dr. Singh is leading a friendly delegation from the Asian Solidarity Committee on a visit here. The delegation arrived here on February 1st and includes Chinese novelist Yang Shuo, Japanese journalist Masaharu Hatanaka, and Soviet writer Anatoly Sofronov, all of whom are representatives of the Asian Solidarity Committee in their respective countries. The Asian Solidarity Committees of various countries were established after the first Asian countries conference held in New Delhi in April 1955.

Dr. Singh spoke about the Asian people's solidarity with the Egyptian people during the recent British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt. He said that the delegation's visit here was to "convey our deepest sympathy and brotherly feelings to the Egyptian people." He expressed admiration for the heroic spirit shown by the Egyptian people in their struggle against aggression.

Singh said that the recent aggression shows that the old-line imperialists still threaten the safety and freedom of the people. He said that in the face of this situation, the close ties between the Asian and African peoples have been strengthened, and a new sense of solidarity has emerged.

He said that the spirit embodied in the Bandung Conference should be maintained. To achieve this goal, the Asian and African peoples should meet more frequently to exchange ideas in a friendly and free manner. He believes that in view of recent world events, especially those affecting Asia and Africa, it is necessary to convene an Afro-Asian People's Conference.

    亚洲团结委员会秘书建议
    在开罗召开亚非人民会议
    新华社开罗9日电　亚洲团结委员会秘书、印度国会议员阿努普·辛格博士8日晚在这里举行的一次记者招待会上说，如果埃及政府和人民欢迎的话，亚洲团结委员会希望将在开罗举行一次亚非人民会议。
    辛格博士正领导着亚洲团结委员会的一个友好代表团在这里进行访问。代表团是2月1日到达这里的，团员包括中国小说作家杨朔、日本新闻工作者畑中政春和苏联作家安纳托利·索弗罗诺夫，他们都是自己国家的亚洲团结委员会的代表。各国的亚洲团结委员会是在1955年4月在新德里举行的第一次亚洲国家会议之后建立起来的。
    辛格博士谈到了在最近英、法和以色列对埃及进行侵略期间亚洲人民对埃及人民的声援。他说，这个代表团这次到这里来是为的“向埃及人转达我们最深切的同情以及我们兄弟般的感情”。他对埃及人民在反抗侵略斗争中所表现的英勇精神表示敬佩。
    辛格说，最近的侵略表明老牌的帝国主义者仍然威胁着人民的安全和自由。他说，面对着这种情况，亚非人民中间的血肉关系也有了加强，并且产生了一种新的团结感。
    他说，应该把万隆会议体现出来的精神保持下去。为了达到这一目标，亚非人民应当更经常地会晤，来友好而自由地交流思想。他认为，鉴于最近的世界事件，特别是影响到亚非的世界事件，有必要召开一次亚非人民会议。
