    Starting from the Benefit of Production
    ——Views on the Scale and Rectification of Joint Village Cooperatives
    New Experience from Practice
    Experience comes from practice. It is not surprising that we lacked experience at the beginning of running cooperatives, a new undertaking. We pay close attention to and cherish the experience of mass practice precisely because it enables us to further understand problems that were not very clear in the past, so that we can advance the cause victoriously.
    Like many other issues of agricultural cooperatives, we have had some new experiences in dealing with the scale of cooperatives over the past year. The scale of cooperatives is an issue directly related to production and distribution. A cooperative with an appropriate scale that meets current production conditions will be more conducive to organizing and developing production, and it will be easier to correctly implement the principle of distribution according to work; if it is not appropriate, it will affect people's enthusiasm for labor and be detrimental to production. It can be said that the scale of a cooperative is, in the final analysis, a question of how to organize production. Therefore, the scale of a cooperative should first be determined from the fundamental requirements and conditions of benefiting production, rather than from other factors. According to a year's experience, the so-called appropriate scale is one that adapts to the needs of production, meets the local economic conditions and the level of management, and other objective and subjective conditions. Based on these conditions, the form may be multiple cooperatives in one village, one cooperative in one village, or joint village cooperatives organized by several villages.
    At the beginning of the advanced cooperative movement, we did not have the same experience in dealing with the scale of cooperatives as we do today. During the period of elementary cooperatives, compared with small cooperatives of ten or eight households, large cooperatives of more than one hundred households had more significant production increases. Therefore, the movement to merge small cooperatives into large cooperatives in the early stages of advanced cooperativization had an objective basis, and some large cooperatives were indeed established according to the needs of developing production. However, some people, seeing this situation, mistakenly believed that the larger the cooperative, the better, without considering whether it was suitable for the needs of production. In addition, some believed that cooperatives should be established according to basic-level administrative divisions (i.e., establishing cooperatives according to the townships at that time); or organize agricultural cooperatives according to the administrative divisions of townships that were about to be merged, on the grounds that it was convenient for leadership. This view that "the bigger the cooperative, the better" and making the production organization adapt to the administrative division, only considering the convenience of leadership from above, and not considering whether leadership within the cooperative was convenient, is the main reason for the emergence of many oversized joint village cooperatives. Later practice proved that these two views were problematic.
    In 1956, the forms and scales of the 24,249 cooperatives in Hebei Province were roughly as follows:
    Multiple cooperatives in one village: 586 cooperatives, accounting for 2.5% of the total number of cooperatives, with an average of 182 households per cooperative, and the total number of households accounting for 1.3% of the total number of households in the province;
    One cooperative in one village: 16,186 cooperatives, accounting for 66.7% of the total number of cooperatives, with an average of 182 households per cooperative, and the total number of households accounting for 36.8% of the total number of households in the province;
    Joint village cooperatives: 7,477 cooperatives, accounting for 30.8% of the total number of cooperatives, with an average of 678 households per cooperative, and the total number of households accounting for 61.9% of the total number of households in the province.
    According to the above statistics, it can be seen that the number of multiple cooperatives in one village is very small, with not many households, and this is a form that is about to pass in Hebei; the number of cooperatives with one cooperative in one village is the largest, although they do not include the majority of farmers, and this is the most appropriate form under current conditions; the proportion of large joint village cooperatives is not the majority, but the total number of farmers included is more than 60%. These types of cooperatives have the greatest impact on the province's agricultural production increase and the income of cooperative members. The rectification of the scale of agricultural cooperatives that we are talking about mainly refers to the rectification of this type of cooperatives. The rectification mentioned here does not mean using only one method to deal with various different situations of joint village cooperatives. From the point of view of benefiting production, rectification at least means two things: some joint village cooperatives are not too large in scale, but the joint villages have brought some contradictions. These contradictions can be resolved within the original scale. Rectification should focus on resolving these contradictions, consolidating the organization, and developing production smoothly; the scale of some other joint village cooperatives is too large, and the contradictions are acute. Only by dividing them can the contradictions be resolved. In this case, dividing them can make production develop smoothly.
    Problems in Income Distribution
    Experience over the past year shows that, in addition to the common problems of general cooperatives, one of the unique problems of joint village cooperatives is the contradiction between the principle of distribution according to work and ensuring that as many cooperative members as possible in each village increase their income compared to the past. This contradiction is specifically manifested in the contradiction between large collectives and small collectives (i.e., unified distribution by the joint village cooperative and the requirement of a certain village to distribute more), and the contradiction between small collectives and small collectives (i.e., the village with increased income and the village with decreased income). This contradiction is mainly caused by the excessive disparity in production and economic conditions between villages.
    For example, in the Boyan Joint Village Cooperative in Wu'an, Nan'anzhuang and Bei'anzhuang have an average of 4.2 mu of land per person, while Dongzhouzhuang and Xizhouzhuang have an average of 3 mu of land per person, a large difference; Boyan Village's cotton yields an average of 200 jin per mu, while Leyu and Bo'erzhuang's cotton only yields over 100 jin, a difference of one-fold; 80% of the land in Boyan and Wenzhang is planted with high-value cotton, while only 40% of the land in Dongzhouzhuang and Yuquan is planted with cotton. Due to the difference in the amount and quality of land and the different crops planted, the original income between villages was unbalanced. In other places, the different production conditions such as fruit trees, reed fields, forests, and livestock in each village also caused the original income imbalance of each village.
    Uniting many villages with different economic conditions and implementing unified distribution according to the principle of distribution according to work actually becomes averaging these villages with originally unbalanced income, making the villages with originally low income suddenly increase their income a lot, and the villages with originally high income unable to increase their income or even suddenly decrease their income a lot. Taking the Boyan Joint Village Cooperative as an example, Yang'erzhuang in the cooperative earned 81% more than the previous year, and a total of more than 34,000 yuan was transferred from other villages to the village, accounting for 38.3% of the village's net income. Nearly 100% of the villagers increased their income. Among the 306 households in the village, 218 households increased their income by one-fold, with an average increase of 111 yuan per household. In Bei'anzhuang, 38.7% of the 302 households were unable to increase their income. If operated independently, this village would have 31.3% more income than unified distribution. Similar situations exist to varying degrees in many joint village cooperatives. This situation makes the principle of unified distribution according to work in joint village cooperatives lose the support of some villages, thereby weakening the basis for uniting the villages. Last year, various forms of localism were extremely serious in many joint village cooperatives. After the first distribution in the wheat season, the relationship within some cooperatives was once tense, and the enthusiasm of cooperative members for production was once low, mainly because of this.
    Here, the joint village cooperative encountered the obstacle of "small collective consciousness" (village centrism) that must be overcome to maintain unity. Only when the joint village cooperative can produce more and give cooperative members greater material benefits will it become a form welcomed by the cooperative members it unites. No matter what the form and scale, the more production and the more income for cooperative members, the better the form and scale. Ideological education is certainly important, but without the necessary material basis, attempting to overcome this so-called "small collective consciousness" by simply strengthening collectivist education and opposing village centrism to reluctantly maintain unity will not have good results.
    We have also seen another situation: many joint village cooperatives have been consolidated. These cooperatives, of course, each have their own different conditions. For example, the economic conditions of villages are not too different; some villages with no experience in running cooperatives are willing to unite with neighboring old cooperatives to develop together; some small villages are willing to unite with large villages with good production and economic conditions. The small villages can benefit, and the large villages do not suffer losses; the villages are very close to each other, and the land of each village is intertwined, making it convenient to cultivate together; when running elementary cooperatives, poor peasants from several neighboring villages were organized together, forming a strong core. During advanced cooperativization, they are still united together; larger farmland infrastructure construction must be carried out by several villages in cooperation; joint development of diversified operations can benefit together, and so on. No matter what the characteristics of these joint village cooperatives are, one thing is clear, that is, these joint village cooperatives have a fundamental condition, that is, they have significant benefits for production and can benefit all villages.
    For example, the Shilou Joint Village Cooperative in Fangshan County has six villages. 56% of the 17,000 mu of cultivated land is low-lying land, which is about eight li long and three li wide, and is often subject to flooding, with a yield of only 60 jin per mu. The state needs to supply relief grain and funds every year. After advanced cooperativization, they united to dig channels totaling 66 li in length and two reservoirs, transforming 4,200 mu of low-lying land into paddy fields. Although they suffered from flooding last year, there was not only enough food but also a surplus. In the future, more grain will be produced, and such joint village cooperatives are welcomed by the masses. Similar examples exist in various places. For example, the Hanjiawa Cooperative in Ding County, the Linshui Cooperative in Xushui County, the Zhoujiazhuang Cooperative in Jin County, the Jianming Cooperative in Zunhua County, the Mafangying Cooperative in Changli County, etc., these joint village cooperatives have all been run relatively well due to their different conditions for uniting.
    Even well-run joint village cooperatives have their own problems. The most important of these is also the distribution problem. Now many joint village cooperatives have also explored some experience in solving this problem. In general, there are three methods: one is to set the production quota appropriately, and distribute according to work within the quota, and the over-produced part is completely or mostly distributed to each team (village) according to work; the second is the "overall contract", contracting labor, contracting production, contracting investment, contracting finance, and contracting draft animals. The income and expenditure within the fixed quota are uniformly distributed and borne by the cooperative, and the income and expenditure exceeding the fixed quota are the responsibility of the team. These two methods can enable villages with better economic conditions to obtain more income; the other is to use the income from diversified operations to balance and ensure that cooperative members in each village increase their income. These methods all adhere to the principle of distribution according to work, while giving appropriate consideration to villages with originally good economic conditions.
    Problems in Business Management
    Another important problem existing in joint village cooperatives is that there is a certain contradiction between the meticulous planned management required by large-scale production and the management level of cadres. This contradiction also exists in general cooperatives, but it is more prominent in joint village cooperatives. Larger joint village cooperatives bring three problems due to long distances, large areas, and large labor forces: First, it is not easy for leaders to go deep into the grassroots, and the discovery and resolution of production, life, and ideological problems is not timely, affecting the connection between leaders and the masses; Second, production management requires both concentration and flexibility. However, due to the large amount of land, the diversity of land characteristics, and the diversity of operations, it is easy to deviate from adapting to local conditions and detach from the experience of the masses; Third, the organization of production teams is too large and too numerous, making command inconvenient and easily causing work stoppages, affecting the improvement of labor efficiency. Some captains of joint village cooperatives said: "In the past (elementary cooperative), when I was the head of the cooperative, I could see it in my eyes and hold it in my heart; now when I am the captain, there are hundreds of laborers and thousands of mu of land, I can't see it with my eyes, and I can't hold it in my heart."
    If we slightly analyze the situation of the existing joint village cooperatives that have been running for a year, we cannot say that as long as it is a joint village cooperative, there must be insurmountable contradictions of being large, numerous, and far away. Taking Shijiazhuang Prefecture as an example: In the 607 joint village cooperatives in the entire prefecture, the joint village cooperatives including two or three villages, villages within three li of each other, and fewer than five or six hundred households account for more than 50%. Some joint village cooperatives have fewer than one hundred households. On the other hand, as far as the situation of joint village cooperatives in the whole province is concerned, there are some in various places where there are problems of being too large, too numerous, and too far away. For example, there are about a thousand joint village cooperatives with more than a thousand households in the province, with the most reaching six thousand households, some including twenty or thirty villages, and some mountain joint village cooperatives with villages seventy li apart. The difficulty in managing such cooperatives is obvious.
    Over the past year, the level of business management of joint village cooperatives in various places has also improved in practice, and a lot of experience has been gained in business management: such as delegating some production and management powers to the teams, so that the production teams have a certain independence in management under unified leadership; conscientiously implementing the system of contracting labor and production and rewarding over-production; gradually assigning part-time jobs, streamlining leadership organizations, transferring cadres to lower levels, and strengthening the leadership of production teams; establishing a system of team member meetings and cooperative member representative meetings, and so on. Generally speaking, joint village cooperatives that are needed for production, not too many joint villages, economic conditions that are not too disparate, cadres who have gained certain experience in management, and can guarantee to achieve increased production and income and are welcomed by the masses should be helped to run better; conversely, if there are many contradictions and cannot guarantee to increase production and increase income, they should consult with the cooperative cadres and cooperative members and take the method of dividing them, so as to be conducive to achieving the goal of ensuring increased production and increased income.
    Scale Depends on Specific Conditions
    Generally speaking, except for the need for multiple villages to unite due to production needs, in the period when social transformation has just been completed, in the transitional period of manual labor before the realization of technological transformation, one should not simply pursue victory by "large" scale.
    Some people say that as long as the cooperative cadres are strong, the joint village cooperative can be run; others say that as long as the problems existing in the joint village cooperative are solved, it will be fine, and there is no need to divide it. This view has a certain truth, and many joint village cooperatives have indeed become consolidated after solving the problems. However, people who hold this view have not seen that the objectively existing contradictions of some joint village cooperatives have hindered the development of production, and these contradictions cannot be solved on the original scale; some problems cannot be solved by the subjective efforts of one or two strong cooperative cadres, and it is harmful to maintain them reluctantly. As for the view that dividing some joint village cooperatives is a step backward, it is just a misunderstanding. Because dividing those joint village cooperatives that must be divided is not only harmless but also beneficial to consolidating the socialist production organization, how can it be said to be a step backward!
    Some people have also seen that there are some contradictions in the joint village cooperatives, but they have not conducted a specific analysis, and they have come to the conclusion that: the scale of the cooperative is "the smaller the better", advocating that all joint village cooperatives be divided, believing that village cooperatives are the only form that should be allowed to exist; or saying without analysis that as long as the masses demand division, they should be divided. This one-sided view simplifies the complex situation and is also harmful to production. If a large joint village cooperative should not be divided but the masses demand division, persuasive education should be carried out to make the masses realize the benefits of joint operation. If they cannot be persuaded for a while and the masses are determined to divide, naturally they should be temporarily separated, waiting for the future to educate the masses with facts.
    Party organizations in many places have criticized these two one-sided views, insisted on proceeding from the benefit of production, consulting with the masses, being realistic, and making specific analysis, guiding and helping joint village cooperatives to rectify, and actively helping to solve problems. They have done a good job of dividing those that should be divided and definitely not dividing those that should not be divided.
    Rectifying the scale of joint village cooperatives is one of the contents of strengthening the organizational construction of cooperatives. Doing this work well is to create a favorable condition for production and unity.

    从有利于生产出发
    ——对于联村社的规模及其整顿的看法冯	小风
    从实践中产生新经验
    经验从实践中来。办合作社这个新的事业，在开始缺乏经验，是不奇怪的。我们所以密切注意和珍视群众实践的经验，正是因为它使我们进一步明白了过去不甚明白的问题，使我们能够把事业胜利地向前推进。
    同农业社的别的很多问题一样，在处理合作社的规模问题上，过去的一年，我们也有一些新的体验。合作社的规模问题，是一个直接关系到生产和分配的问题。符合当前生产条件、规模适当的合作社，就会更有利于组织和发展生产，更易于正确贯彻按劳取酬的分配原则；如果不适当，就会影响到人们的劳动积极性，不利于生产。可以这样说，社的规模问题，归根到底是一个怎样组织生产的问题。因此，决定合作社的规模，首先应该从有利生产这个根本的要求和条件出发，而不应该首先从别的因素来看。根据一年的经验，所谓适当的规模，就是适应生产需要，符合当地经济状况以及管理水平等客观和主观条件。根据这些条件，其形式可能是一村多社，一村一社，或几个村联合组织的联村社。
    在高级合作化运动开始的时候，我们对于处理合作社的规模问题，还没有像今天这样的经验。在办初级社时期，十户八户的小社，和百户以上的大社比较起来，大社的增产能力是更显著的，因此，高级合作化初期的小社并大社的运动，是有其客观基础的，有些大社确是根据发展生产的需要建立起来的。但是有些人看到这种情况，就误认为社越大越好，而不考虑是否适合生产的需要。另外，也有的认为合作社应该按照基层行政区划来建立（即按当时的乡来建社）；或按即将并乡的行政区划组织农业社，理由是领导方便。这种“社越大越好”和使生产组织去适应行政区划，只顾上面领导方便，不考虑社内领导是否方便的看法，是许多规模过大的联村社产生的主要原因。以后实践证明，这两种看法是有问题的。
    1956年，河北省二万四千二百四十九个社的形式和规模的情况，大致如下：
    一村多社：五百八十六个社，占总社数的2.5％，平均一社一百八十二户，其总户数占全省入社总农户的1.3％；
    一村一社：一万六千一百八十六个社，占总社数的66.7％，平均一社一百八十二户，其总户数占全省入社总农户的36.8％；
    联村社：七千四百七十七个社，占总社数的30.8％，平均一社六百七十八户，其总户数占全省入社总农户的61.9％。
    根据以上统计可看出：一村多社为数很少，户数不多，在河北这是一种即将过去的形式；一村一社包括农户虽不是多数，但这类社为数最多，是当前条件下最适当的形式；联村大社的比重，虽不是多数，但包括的总农户却在60％以上。这类社对于全省农业增产和社员的收入影响最大。我们所说的整顿农业社的规模，主要是指整顿这一类社。这里所说的整顿，并不是说只用一种办法去对付各种不同情况的联村社。从有利生产的观点出发，整顿至少意味着两个意思：有一部分联村社，规模并不太大，但由于联村而带来了一些矛盾，这些矛盾也有条件在原有规模内得到解决，整顿就应着重解决这些矛盾，使组织得到巩固，生产顺利发展；另有一部分联村社的规模过大，矛盾尖锐，只有分办才能解决矛盾，在这种情况下，分办才能使生产顺畅的发展。
    在收益分配中的问题
    一年来的经验表明，除开一般合作社共有的问题之外，联村社所特有的问题之一是，按劳取酬原则与保证各村尽可能多的社员比过去增加收入之间的矛盾。这种矛盾具体表现在大集体与小集体（即联村社统一分配和某一村要求多分）之间，小集体与小集体（即收入增加的村与收入减少的村）之间的矛盾。这种矛盾主要是由于村和村之间的生产和经济条件过分悬殊造成的。
    例如，武安伯延联村社，南安庄、北安庄每人平均有四亩二分地，东周庄、西周庄每人平均有三亩地，相差很多；伯延村的棉花，每亩平均产二百斤，而乐峪、伯二庄的棉花不过产一百余斤，相差一倍；伯延、文章有80％的土地是种价值很高的棉花，而东周庄、峪泉的棉地不过40％。由于土地的多少、好坏以及作物种植的不同，村与村之间原来的收入就不平衡。在另外一些地方，由于各村果树、苇田、林木、牧畜等生产条件的不同，也造成了各村原来收入的不平衡。
    把许多经济条件不同的村联合在一起，根据按劳取酬的原则实行统一分配，实际上就成为把这种原来收入不平衡的村加以平均，使得原来收入少的村骤然增加收入很多，原来收入多的村不能增加收入甚至骤然减少很多收入。仍以伯延联村社为例，该社杨二庄较前年多收入81％，由他村调来给该村的款共三万四千多元，相当该村纯收入的38.3％，全村近100％的社员增加收入。全村三百零六户社员中，收入增加一倍的达二百十八户，平均每户多收入一百一十一元。北安庄三百零二户社员，则有38.7％的户不能增加收入。如果单独经营，这个村要比统一分配多收入31.3％。类似的情况，在许多联村社里都程度不同地存在着。这种情况，使联村社统一按劳取酬的原则，失掉了部分村的支持，因而也就削弱了团结各村的基础。去年许多联村社内各种本位主义现象极为严重，麦季第一次分配后，有些社社内关系一度紧张，社员生产情绪一度低落，其主要原因，就在于此。
    在这里，联村社遇到了维持统一所必须克服的“小集体观念”（村本位）这个障碍。联村社只有能够生产得更多，能够给予社员更大的物质利益，才会成为它所联合的社员所欢迎的形式。不论什么样的形式和规模，生产的多，社员收入的多，就是最好的形式和规模。思想教育当然是重要的，没有必要的物质基础，企图只用加强集体主义教育和反对村本位主义的办法，去克服这种所谓“小集体观念”，来勉强维持统一，效果是不会好的。
    我们也看到另外一种情况：有不少联村社巩固起来了。这些社，固然各有自己不同的条件，比如，村和村的经济条件不太悬殊；有些办社没有经验的村，愿意和邻村老社联合，共同发展；有的小村愿意和生产、经济条件好的大村联合，小村能沾光，大村并不吃亏；村与村相距很近，各村土地插花交错，联合起来耕作便利；在办初级社的时候，相邻数村的贫农就组织在一起，成为坚强的核心，高级合作化时，仍联合在一起；进行较大的农田基本建设，必须数村合作；联合发展多种经营，能够共同受益，等等。不管这些联村社的特点如何，有一点是明白的，即这些联村社有一个根本的条件，就是对生产有显著的好处，能做到对各村都有利。
    例如，房山县石楼联村社有六个村，一万七千亩耕地中有56％是洼地，其面积长约八里，宽约三里，常受涝灾，亩产不过六十斤。每年需要国家供应救济粮款。高级合作化后，他们联合起来，挖了总长达六十六华里的渠道和两个水柜，把四千二百亩洼地改造为稻田。去年虽遭水灾，粮食不仅够用而且有余。以后，将能增产更多的粮食，这样的联村社群众是欢迎的。类似的例子，各地都有一些。比如定县韩家洼社，徐水县林水社，晋县周家庄社，遵化县建明社，昌黎县马房营社，等等，这些联村社都因有自己不同的联合条件而办得比较好。
    即便是办得好的联村社，也都各有自己的问题。其中最重要的也是分配问题。现在有不少联村社在解决这个问题上，也摸索到了一些经验。总起来有三个办法：一是定产适当，定产以内统一按劳分配，超产部分完全或绝大部分归各队（村）按劳分配；一是“大包干”，包工包产、包投资、包财务、包耕畜。收支定额以内的由社统一分配和负担，超过定额的收支，由本队负责。这两个办法，都能使经济条件较好的村得到较多的收入；另一个是，以多种经营的收入来平衡和保证各村社员增加收入。这些办法都是坚持了按劳取酬的分配原则，同时给原来经济条件好的村以适当照顾。
    在经营管理上的问题
    联村社存在的另一个重要问题，是大规模生产所要求的周密的计划管理与干部的管理水平之间有一定的矛盾。这个矛盾在一般社也存在，但在联村社就更为突出。较大的联村社，由于距离远、面积大、劳力多，带来了三个问题：一、领导不易深入，发现和解决生产、生活、思想的问题不及时，影响领导与群众的联系；二、生产管理要求既集中又机动。但由于土地多，地性多样，多种经营，容易发生不因地制宜，并和群众经验相脱离的现象；三、生产队的组织过大、过多，指挥不便，容易造成窝工的现象，影响劳动效率的提高。有些联村社的队长说：“过去（初级社）当个社长，眼里看着，心里盛着；现在当个队长，成百的劳力，上千亩的土地，眼也看不到了，心里也盛不下了。”
    如果对已经办了一年的现有的联村社的情况稍加分析，也不能说只要是联村社，就一定存在着大、多、远的不可克服的矛盾。以石家庄专区为例：在全区六百零七个联村社中，一社包括二、三村，村和村相距三里以内、户数在五、六百户以下的联村社，达50％以上。有些联村社户数还不到一百户。另一方面，就全省联村社的情况说，存在着过大、过多、过远问题的，各地都有一部分。如全省千户以上的联村社约有千个，最多的达六千户，有的包括二、三十个村庄，有的山区联村社，村和村相距达七十华里。这样的社，管理困难是显而易见的。
    一年来，各地对联村社的经营管理水平在实践中也有所提高，在经营管理上取得了不少的经验：如把部分生产经营的权下放到队，使生产队在统一领导下，有一定的经营的独立性；认真执行包工包产、超产奖励的制度；逐级兼职，精简领导机构，干部下放，加强生产队的领导；建立队员大会、社员代表会议的制度，等等。一般地说，凡生产需要，联村不多，经济条件不太悬殊，干部在管理上也已取得了一定的经验，能保证实现增产、增收而为群众所欢迎的联村社，就应该尽力帮助它办得更好；相反，如果矛盾很多又不能保证增加生产增加收入的，就应该和社干部、社员商量，采取分办的办法，以便有利于达到保证增产增收的目的。
    规模取决于具体条件
    就一般情况而言，除因生产需要必须多村联合以外，在社会改造刚刚完成的时期，在实现技术改造以前的手工劳动的过渡时期，不应单纯以“大”求胜。
    有人说，只要社干部强，联村社就可以办；也有的说，只要解决了联村社内存在的问题，就行了，不必分开。这种看法有一定的道理，有许多联村社解决了问题确是走向巩固了。但是，持这种说法的人，却未看到有些联村社客观存在的矛盾已经妨碍了生产的发展，而这些矛盾并不是就原有的规模可以解决的；有些问题也不是一、二个强的社干部的主观努力所能解决的，这样勉强维持就是有害的。至于认为把某些联村社分办就是倒退的看法，不过是一种误解。因为分办那些必须分办的联村社，对巩固社会主义的生产组织，不但无害，而且有利，怎么能说是倒退呢！
    也有的人看到了联村社内存在着一些矛盾，并未进行具体分析，便得出结论说：合作社的规模是“越小越好”，主张把联村社一律划开，认为村社才是应该允许存在的唯一形式；或者不加分析地说，只要群众要求分就分，这种片面的看法，是把复杂情况简单化了，对生产也是有害的。如果有的大联村社不应分办而群众要求分办，应进行说服教育，使群众认识合办的好处。如果一时说不服，群众坚决要分，自然还是应当暂时分开，等待将来用事实教育群众。
    许多地方的党组织批判了这两种片面的看法，坚持了从有利生产出发，和群众商量，实事求是，具体分析的作法，指导和帮助联村社进行整顿，积极帮助解决问题。做到了该分办的就分办，不该分办的就一定不分办。
    整顿联村社的规模，是加强合作社组织建设的内容之一。把这个工作做好，就是给生产和团结创造一个有利的条件。
