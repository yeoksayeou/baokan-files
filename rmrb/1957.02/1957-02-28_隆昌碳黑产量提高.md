Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The unit output of carbon black extracted from natural gas at the state-owned Longchang Gas Mine is now nearly double what it was in 1952.

    Currently, the gas mine's machinery and equipment, as well as the natural gas used, are the same as in 1952. The increase in unit output of carbon black is mainly due to a series of technical improvements in production.

    The desulfurization method for removing hydrogen sulfide from natural gas, proposed by technician Chen Zhengqiu, increased the carbon black production from natural gas by 14%; technical personnel also devised methods to enrich the composition of the raw materials by adding a small amount of heavy hydrocarbons to the natural gas, thereby increasing the carbon black production by 10%. Last year, engineering technicians designed and manufactured a set of large pipelines with exhaust equipment to recover the residual gas containing a large amount of carbon black from the escaping skylights. Calculations show that more than 20,000 kilograms of carbon black can be recovered annually.

    Currently, the mine's employees are continuing to study ways to save raw materials and increase production. They plan to increase the output per cubic meter of natural gas from the current level of about 26 grams to 30 grams.

    隆昌碳黑产量提高
    据新华社讯　国营隆昌气矿现在从天然气中采制碳黑的单位产量，比1952年增加了将近一倍。
    现在气矿的机器设备及使用的天然气，都同1952年一样。碳黑单位产量增加，主要是在生产上进行了一系列技术改进。
    技术员陈正秋提出的清除天然气中的硫化氢的脱硫方法，使天然气的碳黑产量增加了14％；技术人员还想法富化原料的成分，在天然气中加进一种少量的重碳氢化合物，从而使采制碳黑的产量增加了10％。去年，工程技术人员设计制造了一套有抽风设备的巨大管道，把含有大量碳黑的燃余气，从逸出的天窗中收回来。经过计算，每年可以收回二万多公斤碳黑。
    目前，这个矿的职工正在继续研究节约原料和提高产量，他们准备把每立方公尺天然气的产量从现在的二十六克左右提高到三十克。
