Xinhua News Agency, London, February 27th: British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Peter Thorneycroft, announced in the House of Commons on the 26th that an agreement for Britain to borrow $500 million from the Export-Import Bank of the United States was formally signed in Washington on the 25th.

According to the agreement, Britain can draw on this loan from now until February 28, 1958, at an interest rate of 4.5%; Britain must use its holdings of dollar securities as collateral for the loan.

Thorneycroft stated that Britain will rely on this loan to pay for the major part of goods purchased by Britain in U.S. dollars. Reports say that the loan will be used to pay for oil purchased by Britain from the United States and Venezuela.

Prior to this, Britain had already borrowed $1.3 billion from the International Monetary Fund. After the failed invasion of Egypt, Britain has borrowed a total of $1.8 billion.

    新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：英国财政大臣桑尼克罗夫特26日在下院宣布，英国向美国的进出口银行借款五亿美元的协议25日在华盛顿正式签字。
    根据这项协议，英国可以在从现在起到1958年2月28日为止的这一段时期内动用这笔贷款，利息是4.5％；英国必须以它所持有的美元证券作为这项贷款的抵押品。
    桑尼克罗夫特表示，英国将依靠这笔贷款来支付英国用美元来购买的货物的主要部分。消息说，英国从美国和委内瑞拉购买的石油就将用这笔借款来支付。
    在此以前，英国已经向国际货币基金借了十三亿美元。在侵略埃及战争失败以后，英国一共已经借了十八亿美元的债。
