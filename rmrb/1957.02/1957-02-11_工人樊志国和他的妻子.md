    Worker Fan Zhiguo and His Wife
    By Our Correspondent Gu Ye
    Fan Zhiguo, the chief foreman of the open-hearth furnace, finished a day's work, left the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and entered the densely lit dormitory area. When he got home, his wife, Zhang Gaiying, seemed to be deliberately going against him. She didn't bring out the food for a long time, but instead nagged, "So you're back early, huh? It's already pitch dark." After a while, she brought a few steamed buns and a plate of stir-fried yam strips. Fan Zhiguo thought, "I've been sweating all day, why doesn't she give me something watery to drink?" Zhang Gaiying, on the other hand, continued to nag, "You, you don't even have a home in your heart; none of the neighbors are like you. When they get home, they're either making coal briquettes or fetching water, but you!" Fan Zhiguo, having worked all day, needed a quiet rest. His wife's nagging irritated him. With a wave of his hand, cups, plates, bowls, chopsticks, steamed buns, and yam scattered all over the floor, and he turned around and went back to the factory.

    One day, the trade union organized the workers' families to visit the factory. A large group of women crowded into the workshop. Zhang Gaiying looked around, feeling a burst of nervousness. How could she even find a place to stand here? In this tall and spacious workshop, there was constant roaring noise, and the air was filled with smoke and dust. Just as she saw a charging machine sliding sideways, she barely dodged it, and then the furnace door opened, sparks dazzling, and she felt a burst of heat all over her body. She was so startled that she didn't dare to move.

    After getting used to it a bit, Zhang Gaiying searched for her husband, but couldn't find him anywhere. The people by the steelmaking furnace were all wearing light green canvas clothes, gloves, canvas shoes, blue glasses clipped to the brim of their hats, and a sweat-wiping towel around their necks. Each of them held an iron shovel, sweat dripping from their foreheads, rushing towards the blazing furnace door, throwing materials into the furnace. ...

    "Take a good look, are floral fabrics and leather shoes easy to buy?" A young man approached the women and said a playful joke. At this moment, saying just a few words carried more weight than saying thousands of words at home. Hearing this, they deeply felt that they hadn't cared enough for their husbands in the past.

    Leaving the factory gate, all that could be heard was a chorus of whispers:

    "Look at what your man is wearing, drenched in sweat..."

    "Don't say it. Anyone who lets their man make coal briquettes at home again is heartless!"

    "Hey, you're not going home, where are you going?"

    "To get some meat for my man."

    That day, when Fan Zhiguo returned home, Zhang Gaiying quickly brought him hot mutton soup. Fan Zhiguo felt unprecedented joy.

    工人樊志国和他的妻子
    本报记者　顾页
    平炉总工长樊志国结束了一天的劳动，走出太原钢铁厂，投进了灯火密集的宿舍区里。到家的时候，他的妻子张改英好像故意跟他作对，很久不端出饭来，反倒唠唠叨叨地说：“你才回来得早呐，天都黑尽了。”过一阵，拿了几个馒头，端了一碟炒山药丝来。樊志国想：“一天淌了好多汗，干吗不给我喝点稀的呢？”张改英却在一旁又唠叨起来：“你呀，心里就没有个家；人家隔壁邻舍的人谁像你。他们回到家里，不是打煤糕，就是提水，你呢！”樊志国劳动了一天，需要安静的休息。妻子的这种唠叨劲儿，使他生气了。一挥手，杯盘碗筷，馒头山药，掀了一地，他又转身进厂去了。
    一天，工会组织工人家属参观工厂。一大群妇女拥进了车间。张改英举目一看，心里一阵紧张，这哪有个插足的地方呀。在这高大宽敞的车间里，到处是轰鸣声，空气里弥漫着烟尘。眼看装料机横着身子滑过来了，刚让过它去，炉门又开了，火花耀眼，周身感到一团火气，她惊得一步也不敢走动。
    稍稍习惯了些，张改英就寻找自己的丈夫，可是怎么也找不着。炼钢炉旁的人们，都穿着浅绿色的帆布衣服，戴着手套，穿着帆布鞋，帽沿上夹着一付蓝眼镜，脖子上围了一条揩汗的毛巾。一个个手握铁锹把，满头汗珠，奔向张开火口的炉门，向炉内投料。……
      “仔细瞅瞅吧，花布、皮鞋是容易买的吗？”一个小伙子，凑到妇女们跟前，说了一句开玩笑的调皮话。这时候，讲上一言半语，比在家里讲上千言万语的份量还要重。她们听了这句话，深深感到过去对丈夫关心不够。
    离开厂门，只听到一阵嘁嘁喳喳的话语声：
    “看你男人穿的戴的，一头大汗……”
    “别说了。谁再让自己的男人回家打煤糕，真没心肝！”
    “咦，你不回家，往哪里去？”
    “给男人割点肉呗。”
    这天，樊志国回到家里，张改英很快就将热腾腾的羊肉汤端来了。樊志国感到前所未有的快慰。
