    Egypt Accuses Imperialism of Helping Israel
    US and France Collude in Attempting to Clear the Way for Israel in the Gulf of Aqaba
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 21st: Egyptian Director of Intelligence Hatem issued a statement on the 20th saying: "If imperialists insist on helping Israel defy the United Nations and violate UN resolutions, it will only harm world peace."
    Hatem pointed out that despite Israel's long record of aggression against the borders of Egypt and Arab countries in general, some imperialist countries are still trying to obtain illegal guarantees for Israel, while completely ignoring the legitimate rights and interests of Palestinian Arabs who have been driven from their homes.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 21st: Egypt's "Al-Gomhouria" newspaper criticized US Secretary of State Dulles's remarks on the 20th about sending ships through the Gulf of Aqaba, saying: "Dulles's aim is clearly to guarantee Israel's spoils of aggression in order to reward Israel." "Al-Ahram" said: "It has become as clear as day that the United States is supporting Israel's position."
    Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: Paris dispatch: A French Foreign Ministry spokesman announced on the 19th that France is prepared to adopt the American idea of sending merchant ships through the Gulf of Aqaba to support Israel's demand for guarantees that the Gulf of Aqaba will not be blockaded by Egyptian artillery fire. He said at a weekly press conference that France believes Israel's demand for guarantees before withdrawing from the occupied Egyptian territory is "legitimate." He also said: "The Americans think so too."

    埃及指责帝国主义帮助以色列
    美法狼狈为奸企图在亚喀巴湾替以色列开道
    新华社开罗21日电　埃及情报司司长哈特姆20日发表声明说：“如果帝国主义者坚持帮助以色列藐视联合国和违反联合国的决议，这只有使世界和平遭受损害。”
    哈特姆指出，尽管以色列侵略埃及边境和一般的阿拉伯国家的边境已有很久的纪录，可是有些帝国主义国家仍旧在力图为以色列取得非法的保证，而对被赶出家园的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的合法权益却完全忽视。
    据新华社开罗21日电　埃及“共和国报”20日抨击美国国务卿杜勒斯关于派遣船只通过亚喀巴湾的谈话说：“杜勒斯的目的显然是想保证以色列的侵略所得，来奖赏以色列。”“金字塔报”说：“事情已经如同白昼一样的清楚：美国是支持以色列的立场的。”
    新华社21日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部发言人19日宣布，法国准备采纳美国的主意：派遣商船通过亚喀巴湾，以支持以色列所提出的保证亚喀巴湾不受埃及炮火封锁的要求。他在每周一次的记者招待会上说，法国认为以色列在撤出所侵占的埃及领土之前要求给予保证是“合法的”。他还说：“美国人也认为是这样”。
