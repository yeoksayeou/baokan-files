    Deputy County Party Secretary Carries a Manure Basket
        Wang Ziying, Huo Chaoxian
    Not long ago, Comrade Jiang Zihe, Deputy Secretary of the Changli County Party Committee, led a work team to Peijiabao, Qiuying, Ge Tiaogang and other townships to help township and commune cadres mobilize the masses to carry out the winter manure accumulation campaign. They found that a lot of manure was left uncollected along the way; many township and commune cadres, whether the road was near or far, did not carry manure baskets when going to meetings in the township or going down to work, but rode bicycles. After arriving in Peijiabao Township, he first called on township and commune cadres to carry manure baskets to lead the commune members to collect manure. At this time, some township and commune cadres carried manure baskets, but some township and commune cadres couldn't let go of their airs, thinking that they were township and commune cadres, and carrying manure baskets to collect manure was "not very presentable." After Jiang Zihe realized this situation, he deeply felt that education should be carried out among township and commune cadres to promote the spirit of hard work and plain living and to share weal and woe with the broad masses. At the same time, he thought: if he only calls on township and commune cadres to do it, why can't he carry a manure basket himself! Thinking of this, he decided to carry a manure basket himself first.
    On December 30th last year, just as the sky was beginning to dawn, he got up, carried his manure basket, and went to Wangzhuang, Changzhuang and other communes to inspect work. That day, he not only gained an in-depth understanding of many situations, but also collected two large baskets of manure.
    The news that the Deputy County Party Secretary was carrying a manure basket to collect manure quickly spread in the township. Commune members said, "Even the County Party Secretary is carrying a manure basket to collect manure, let's hurry up and carry manure baskets to collect manure!" Some township and commune cadres said, "Secretary Jiang has already carried a manure basket, shouldn't we quickly put down our airs!" On the same day, the township head, Party Committee Secretary, and Communist Youth League Secretary of Peijiabao Township quickly carried manure baskets. Lu Guifang, the director of the township women's federation, didn't have a manure basket herself, so she ran to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy one and carried it. In just two or three days, more than 40 commune cadres from the three communes in the township all automatically carried manure baskets.
    The news that Comrade Jiang Zihe and all the township and commune cadres of Peijiabao Township were carrying baskets to collect manure quickly reached the ears of the township and commune cadres of Qiuying, Ge Tiaogang, Liangshan and other five townships east of Changli County, and they also carried manure baskets one by one. From January 1st to 11th this year, in Liangshan, Qiuying, Ge Tiaogang and other five townships and sixteen agricultural cooperatives east of Changli County, more than 2,400 people have already carried manure baskets to collect manure.

    县委副书记背粪筐
        王子英　霍超先
    不久前，中共昌黎县委副书记江子贺同志，带领工作组到裴家堡、丘营、葛条港等乡，帮助乡、社干部发动群众开展冬季积肥运动。他们发现一路上有很多粪没人拾；许多乡、社干部到乡里开会或下去工作，不论道路远近都不背粪筐，而是骑自行车。他到裴家堡乡以后，首先就号召乡、社干部背起粪筐，带动社员群众拾粪。这时，有些乡、社干部背起了粪筐，但还有的乡、社干部放不下架子，认为自己是乡里和社里的干部，背粪筐拾粪“不太好看”。江子贺发觉这种情况以后，深感应当向乡、社干部进行发扬艰苦朴素作风和广大群众同甘共苦的教育。同时他又想：光号召乡、社干部做，自己为什么不可以背上粪筐呢！想到这里，他就决心自己先背上粪筐。
    去年12月30日，天刚蒙蒙亮，他就起来背上粪筐到王庄、常庄等社去检查工作。这天，他不但深入了解了好多情况，还拾了两大筐粪。
    县委副书记背粪筐拾粪的事，很快就在这乡传播起来，社员们说：“县委书记都背粪筐拾粪了，咱们也快背粪筐拾粪吧！”有的乡、社干部说：“江书记都背上粪筐了，咱们还不赶快放下架子！”当天，裴家堡乡的乡长、党委书记、团委书记都很快地背上了粪筐。乡妇联主任陆桂芳，自己没有粪筐，就跑到供销社门市部买来一个背上。仅两、三天的时间，这乡三个社的四十多个社干部全部自动背上了粪筐。
    江子贺同志和裴家堡乡全乡的乡、社干部背筐拾粪的消息，很快传到了昌黎县城东的丘营、葛条港、两山等五个乡的乡、社干部耳朵里，他们也一个个都背上了粪筐。从今年1月1日到11日，昌黎城东的两山、丘营、葛条港等五个乡、十六个农业社，已有两千四百多人背起了粪筐拾粪。
