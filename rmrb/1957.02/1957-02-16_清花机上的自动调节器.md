Xinhua News Agency Report: An "automatic regulator" capable of solving the problem of uneven cotton laps in cotton spinning mills and saving raw cotton has been manufactured at the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. Preliminary tests over the past month or so have proven that installing this regulator on the scutcher is very beneficial in resolving the problem of uneven cotton laps.

In the past, when making cotton laps in the scutcher workshop, the cotton feeding speed was not slowed down when starting and stopping the machine, causing the first yard to yard and a half of the cotton lap to be too thick. If this section of the cotton lap was not torn off, it would affect the uniformity of the cotton yarn; tearing it off would increase the amount of waste cotton and waste raw cotton. After installing this regulator, as long as the "automatic regulator" and the component on the scutcher that controls the cotton feeding speed are adjusted in advance according to the required cotton lap length, the cotton feeding speed will automatically slow down when starting and stopping the machine, overcoming the previous shortcomings. According to factory calculations, the entire factory can reduce waste cotton by 2% as a result.

The "automatic regulator" was successfully trial-produced by Zhang Yide, the deputy foreman of Shift A, and Zhu Jun, the shift leader, of the scutcher workshop of the No. 2 Weaving Plant of the Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. The factory plans to install this regulator on all scutchers.

### 清花机上的自动调节器

    清花机上的自动调节器
    据新华社讯　一种能够解决棉纺织厂棉卷不匀、又能节约原棉的“自动调节器”，已经在天津第二棉纺织厂制造出来。经过最近一个多月的初步试验，证明在清花机上安装了这种调节器以后，对解决棉卷不匀问题有很大好处。
    过去清花车间做棉卷，由于在开车、停车的时候没有减慢给棉速度，使一开头的一码到一码半左右长的棉卷过厚，如果不把这段棉卷撕掉就影响棉纱的均匀度；撕下来又会增加许多回花，浪费原棉。安装这种调节器以后，只要按照所需要的棉卷长度，事先把“自动调节器”和清花机上控制给棉速度的部件调整好，开车、停车的时候就自动地减慢了给棉速度，克服了过去的毛病。据工厂测算，全厂因此可以减少2％的回花。
    “自动调节器”是天津第二棉纺织厂二纺场清花车间甲班副工长张义德和值班长朱俊等人试制成功的，工厂准备在所有的清花机上都安装这种调节器。
