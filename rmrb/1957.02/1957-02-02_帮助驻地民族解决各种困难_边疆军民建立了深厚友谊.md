Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army units stationed on the frontier, guarding the motherland, have helped local fraternal ethnic groups overcome various difficulties and have established a deep friendship with the people of fraternal ethnic groups.

    Many troops stationed in Yunnan helped fraternal ethnic groups establish agricultural production cooperatives, and also helped them improve farming techniques and develop agricultural production. A company stationed in an area inhabited by several ethnic groups, including the Hani, Dai, and Miao, saw that the people were backward in production and lived in poverty. The officers and soldiers were determined to help the local people change this situation. They first reclaimed wasteland and dug ditches, planted rice and Chinese cabbage, setting an example for the people of the minority nationalities. Then they taught the local people how to plow, cultivate, weed, and accumulate fertilizer, no longer adopting the primitive farming methods of "slash-and-burn cultivation, extensive planting and sparse harvesting." Local agricultural production increased, and the people's lives greatly improved. Soldiers from a unit stationed in the Miao area used their allowances to subsidize the Miao agricultural production cooperative, and also promoted the experience of single-plant close planting and double-plant close planting of corn to the members. Mi Zhanxun, a reconnaissance member of a border defense unit, heard that the people of a Ka Wa village were often in disputes over water because of insufficient water sources, so he led soldiers to help the people dig a spring and diverted the water to the village. Some troops also helped the people of fraternal ethnic groups dig rivers and build dams to resist drought.

    Patrol soldiers of the border defense forces guarding the Pamir Plateau often help Tajik herdsmen protect their flocks from wolf attacks.

    Many troops have helped minority nationalities set up schools and often treat illnesses for the elderly, women, and children. In Mangku, on the Guangxi border, there is a sergeant medic named Luo Zhengchang, known by the local people as a "good doctor," who has treated more than 500 patients. Sometimes when women have difficult deliveries, they also ask him to help with the delivery.

    The people of all ethnic groups love the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army as they love their own sons. They lead the lost people and vehicles of the People's Liberation Army, and act as guides; when there is a situation, they run from far away to deliver letters to the troops; when some soldiers are sick, the old mothers take care of them. When the troops are transferred, the people come to see them off with reluctance.

    帮助驻地民族解决各种困难
    边疆军民建立了深厚友谊
    据新华社1日讯　守卫在祖国边疆的中国人民解放军各部队的官兵们，帮助驻地兄弟民族解决了各种困难，跟兄弟民族人民建立了深厚友谊。
    驻在云南的许多部队帮助兄弟民族建立了农业生产合作社，还帮助他们改进耕作技术，发展农业生产。一个驻在有哈尼族、傣族、苗族等几种民族地区的连队，看到人民生产落后，生活穷困，军官和战士下决心帮助当地人民改变这种情况。他们先开垦荒地、挖掘沟渠，种了水稻和大白菜，给少数民族的人民做了榜样。然后教给当地人民犁地、耕地、锄草、积肥，不再采用“刀耕火种、广种薄收”的原始耕作办法。当地的农业生产量提高了，人民的生活也大大改善了。驻在苗族地区的一个部队的战士们，拿自己的津贴费资助苗族的农业生产合作社，还向社员们推广了包谷单株密植和双株密植的经验。某边防部队侦察员米占训，听说一个佧佤族村寨的人因为水源不足，常常为争水闹纠纷，便带领战士帮助人民挖了水泉，并且把水引到村寨里去。有些部队还帮助兄弟民族的人民挖河、修坝，抵御旱灾。
    守卫在帕米尔高原上的边防军巡逻兵，时常帮助塔吉克的牧民护卫羊群，不受狼的侵袭。
    许多部队帮助少数民族开办了学校，还经常为老人、妇女和小孩治病。在广西边境芒库，有一个被当地人民称为“好医官”的中士卫生员罗正昌，先后治好了五百多个病人。有时妇女难产，人们也请他去帮助接生。
    各族人民热爱解放军的军官和战士，如同热爱自己的儿子。他们给解放军迷路的人和车辆领路、作向导；有了情况，从很远的地方跑来给部队送信；有的战士病了老妈妈们便守护侍候。部队移防，人们都来恋恋不舍地送行。
