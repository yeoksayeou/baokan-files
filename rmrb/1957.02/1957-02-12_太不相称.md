Too Incompatible

Last year, the Shijiazhuang area suffered from severe flooding. The people of Shijiazhuang City automatically donated a large amount of relief supplies to support them. The capital sent a medical team. Hebei Province and Shijiazhuang City also formed慰问 (wèi wèn) groups respectively to visit the disaster areas. The people in the disaster areas were all overjoyed, and their confidence in self-reliance through production was even more strengthened.

In order to express its gratitude, the Shijiazhuang Prefecture spent 1,400 yuan to host a lavish banquet to bid farewell to them. Spending this money was completely inappropriate. Those invited were representatives慰问 (wèi wèn) the disaster areas; they were there to serve the disaster victims and did not need a banquet. Moreover, on the one hand, there was disaster relief, and on the other hand, state money was used to host a banquet, which was really too incompatible.

    太不相称
    去年，石家庄地区遭受了严重水灾。石家庄市人民自动捐献了大批救济物资加以支援。首都派来了医疗队。河北省、石家庄市也分别组成了慰问团体，亲临灾区慰问。灾区人民无不欢欣鼓舞，他们生产自救的信心更为坚定了。
    石家庄专署为了表达自己的感激之情，花了一千四百元，大摆酒席，为他们饯行。花这笔钱是完全不应该的。被请者是慰问灾区的代表，他们是为灾民服务的，不需要酒席款待。更何况一方面救灾，一方面又用国家的钱来办酒席，实在太不相称了。
