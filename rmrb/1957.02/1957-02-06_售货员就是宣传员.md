Some people view the work of salespeople in stores as very simple, as if they only need to sell the goods that customers want and that are available on the shelves to be considered dutiful. In fact, a good salesperson has much more to do in serving customers.

Xinhua News Agency reported, "Treat the counter as a propaganda platform; the salesperson is a propagandist." This is the call recently made by the Chinese Communist Party’s Tianjin Municipal Public-Private Joint Venture Zhongyuan Company branch to all salespeople. Now, twenty-seven sales teams have made doing a good job of propaganda and explanation to customers one of the guarantee conditions in the advanced worker movement. When some commodities are in short supply, salespeople ask customers about their intended use and actively recommend other commodities that can be substituted. For example, when the company’s supply of striped cloth for clothing linings is insufficient, salespeople in the printed cloth department explain to customers, "Printed cloth is only two or three cents more expensive per foot than striped cloth, and buying enough for a clothing lining will only cost a dime or two more. However, the quality of printed cloth is good, and it doesn't fade." In this way, customers are happy to buy it. Many customers have adopted the suggestions of the printed cloth department’s salespeople and bought substitute fabrics.

A salesperson who loves commercial work will never be satisfied with merely remembering the names or prices of dozens of commodities. They will constantly absorb interesting knowledge about various commodities to serve consumers and serve the cause of socialism. It is hoped that more such respectable commercial workers will be seen in various stores!

### “售货员就是宣传员”

    “售货员就是宣传员”
    有些人把商店里的售货员的工作看得十分简单，仿佛他只要把顾客要的、而货架上又有的商品卖出去，就算尽职了。其实，一个好的售货员在为顾客服务上面值得做的事情还多着哩。
    据新华社报道，“把柜台当作宣传台，售货员就是宣传员”，这是中共天津市公私合营中原公司支部最近向全体售货员提出的号召。现在二十七个售货小组已经把作好对顾客的宣传解释工作作为先进工作者运动中的保证条件之一。当有些商品供应不足的时候，售货员们就向顾客问明用途，主动介绍其他可以代替的商品。比如做衣服里子的条格布公司供应不足，花布柜的售货员就给顾客解释：“花布每尺比条格布只贵两三分钱，买一件衣服里子也不过多花一两毛钱，可是花布质量好，还不掉色。”这样，顾客都乐意买了。许多顾客采纳了花布柜售货员们的建议，买了可以代替的布匹。
    一个热爱商业工作的售货员，永远不会以仅仅记住几十种商品的名称或价钱为满足，他会不断地吸取关于各种商品的有趣的知识，用来为消费者服务，为社会主义事业服务。希望在各个商店里看到更多的这样值得尊敬的商业工作者！
