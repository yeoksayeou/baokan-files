Guard Against the Infiltration of Privilege Mentality
	Chen Jun

	In the old society, power and influence were linked together. Those who held power also had influence. With power and influence, one could be different from ordinary people, enjoying extra benefits, receiving protection outside the law, and even doing whatever one pleased. Although this privilege mentality was often met with people's disgust and hatred, it was considered natural and unremarkable in the old society. However, this kind of privilege mentality is incompatible with communists. What communists pursue is not power and influence, nor is it for the personal glory and wealth of any individual or a few people when communists hold power, but to lead the people in building an ideal society. For this purpose, in the arduous years of the revolution, tens of thousands of communists sacrificed their personal lives without hesitation. Similarly, after the victory of the revolution and the most difficult days have passed, there are still many difficulties in the cause of building socialism, and the days when all the people of the country have enough food and clothing are still not near. Therefore, communists must still endure hardship before enjoying comfort, worry about the world before rejoicing, and rejoice after the world rejoices. This selfless spirit is the guarantee that we can always be with the people and overcome all difficulties to advance victoriously.

	However, after all, our party's tens of thousands of members grew up in the old society, and many old ideological consciousnesses, when we are not vigilant, and when our party has become the ruling party, will secretly invade the daily lives of some comrades and manifest themselves as special to varying degrees. Today, our newspaper reported the situation of a female cadre who has not worked for three years. Although, from the matter itself, its nature is not very serious, this matter makes us smell a taste that should be highly vigilant.

	Comrade Gao Lianying is a party member and an ordinary staff member of an organization. She should have, like all party members and staff members of the organization, honestly accepted the party's assignment and the personnel section's transfer, undertaken certain work, and conscientiously and responsibly done her job, contributing her greatest strength to the great socialist construction cause. However, she is different from others. She can use a minor illness as an excuse to take long-term rest and not work. When the organization asks her to work, she proposes that she can only take on work that "does not require reading documents, going to the countryside, or using her brain." And all the enjoyment she receives far exceeds what she deserves. Why can she be so special, and why is the organization she is in helpless to her? There is no other mystery, only because her husband is the secretary of the prefectural party committee, the head of the organization. The idea of "a wife gains honor through her husband's position" has harmed Gao Lianying. She has forgotten that she is a servant of the people, and has forgotten the most basic obligations of a communist party member to the party and the people. She has not worked for a long time, but she still receives her salary and can go here and there at will to "treat her illness." However, our Comrade Li Pinru only thought about sharing the joys and sorrows with his wife, and forgot about sharing the joys and sorrows with the people. Comrades inside and outside the party and the organization department of the prefectural party committee have repeatedly carried out patient persuasion and waiting for them, and put forward criticisms and advice, but they are indifferent and unmoved.

	Making mistakes is not terrible. If we are wrong, the party and the people can help us discover and correct our mistakes in time. What is truly terrible is that the error has been exposed and has already produced bad results. Like Comrade Gao Lianying, it has caused dissatisfaction among comrades inside and outside the party and has become a special figure in the organization, but she is still not aware of it and thinks it is right.

	Comrade Li Pinru is the secretary of the prefectural party committee. Not to mention his past contributions to the revolution, just talking about the fact that he is now entrusted by the party to take on the leadership work of a special zone, his responsibilities are naturally not light, and the hard work he puts in can also be imagined. However, can he therefore think that his wife can be a little special? Moreover, she also has a "disease"? Why must comrades create tension between their husband and wife? Can't they live in peace for a long time and share happiness together? Are comrades deliberately making things difficult for them? No. Please see, what excessive demands have comrades and the organization made of Comrade Li Pinru and Gao Lianying? None. All that is required is that Gao Lianying can work well like a party member and ordinary staff member, not be satisfied with being a "official's wife," not working for food, abandoning her responsibilities and obligations to the people, and enjoying the generosity of the people out of proportion. If Comrade Gao Lianying still can't understand, shouldn't Li Pinru, as a husband, as a comrade, and as a superior, help her recognize that the idea of "a wife gains honor through her husband's position" is wrong, and recognize that it is incompatible with the title of a communist party member to not work and covet enjoyment? The family of a communist party member cannot be like what the old society described: in a family, as long as one person cultivates and attains enlightenment, not only the whole family, young and old, but even the chickens and dogs they raise can ascend to heaven together and share immortal happiness. The more responsible the comrades are, the more they need to have such awareness, and work more conscientiously and diligently, using the power we have grasped to do good things for the people. And we cannot be satisfied with ourselves in this way, but also set an example to educate our wives and children to love labor, love the people, be diligent and thrifty, and never allow our wives and children to become aristocratic ladies and children.

	On page 5 of this newspaper on February 9th, a short article by Xia Boyang's daughter about Xia Boyang was published, talking about the situation of Xia Boyang educating his children at that time, which made people feel the heroic nature of Xia Boyang intimately. Every communist party member only has the obligation to serve the people and has no right to demand extra enjoyment. We hope that Comrade Li Pinru and Gao Lianying will become vigilant and correct their mistakes with the help of comrades and the party organization. Logically speaking, there is nothing difficult about this. We also want to take this opportunity to remind all comrades to guard against the intrusion of privilege mentality into our daily lives, so that we will increasingly deviate from the masses without realizing it.

    谨防特权思想的潜入
    陈浚
    在旧社会里，权和势是连在一起的，掌了权就有了势。有权有势，就可以不比寻常人，得到分外的享受，得到法外的保护，甚且为所欲为。这种特权思想，虽则往往遭到人们的厌恶和痛恨，但在旧社会里，却是理所当然、不足为奇的。然而，这种特权思想，对于共产党人来说，却是水火不相容的。共产党人所追求的不是炙手可热的权势，共产党人掌了权，不是为任何个人或少数人的荣华富贵，而是要领导人民建设理想的社会。为了这个目的，在革命的艰苦岁月里，成千成万的共产党员，牺牲了自己个人的生命，而义无返顾。同样，革命胜利了，最艰苦的日子过去了，但是，在建设社会主义的事业中，困难还多，距离全国人民丰衣足食的日子，也还不近。因之，共产党人依然要吃苦在先，享乐在后，先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐。这一种大公无私的精神，正是我们能够同人民永远在一起、能够克服一切困难胜利前进的保证。
    但是，毕竟我们党的成千成万的党员，都是从旧社会里长大的，许多旧的思想意识，在我们不警惕的时候，在我们党已经成为执政的党的时候，会偷偷地侵入某些同志的日常生活里，在不同程度上，表现出特殊来。今天我们报上报道了一个三年不工作的女干部的情况，虽则，从这件事情的本身来讲，它的性质还不是很严重的，但从这件事情里，却让我们嗅到了应当十分警觉的味道。
    高莲英同志，是一个党员，一个机关的普通工作人员，她本来应当同所有的党员和机关工作人员一样，老老实实地接受党的分配、人事科的调动，担任一定的工作，并且认真负责地做好自己的工作，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中，贡献出自己最大的力量。可是，她竟与众不同。她能借口一点小病，长期休养，不工作。当组织上要求她工作的时候，她提出只能担任“不看文件、不下乡、不动脑筋”的工作。而她所得到的一切享受，却又远远超过了她所应得的。为什么她竟能如此特殊，而她所在的机关又对她无可奈何呢？没有别的奥妙，只因为她的丈夫是地委书记，机关的首长。“夫贵妻荣”的思想，害了高莲英。她忘掉了自己是人民的勤务员，忘掉了一个共产党员对党对人民最起码的义务。她长期不工作，却照领薪金，还能到这里到那里随心所欲地去“治病”。而我们的李频如同志，却只想到了夫妻之间的同甘共苦，忘掉了同人民群众的同甘共苦。党内外的同志和地委组织部，一再对他们进行了耐心的说服和等待，提出了批评和劝告，但是他们竟安之若素，无动于衷。
    犯错误，并不可怕。错了，有党有人民，能够帮助我们及时发现和纠正错误。真正可怕的，是在错误已经暴露出来，并且已经产生了恶果，像高莲英同志那样，引起党内外同志的不满，成了机关里特殊人物，还不自觉，以为是应该的。
    李频如同志是地委书记，不说他过去对革命的功劳，单讲他现在受到党的委托，担负一个专区的领导工作，责任自然不轻，他工作的辛劳也是可以想见的。但是，能不能因此就以为自己的妻子可以特殊些呢？何况她还有“病”呢？为什么同志们一定要在他们夫妻之间制造紧张局势，不能让他们长此和平共处，有福同享下去呢？是不是同志们故意跟他们两人为难呢？不是的。请看，同志们、组织上究竟对李频如和高莲英同志提出了什么过苛的要求呢？没有。有的只是要求高莲英能像一个党员和普通工作人员那样，好好做工作，不要满足于当“官太太”，不劳而食，放下对人民的责任和义务，非分地享受人民的渥遇。如果高莲英同志还想不通的话，难道作为丈夫，作为同志，作为上级的李频如同志，还不应该帮助她认清“夫贵妻荣”的想法是错误的，认清不工作而贪图享受是同共产党员的称号不相称的吗？共产党员的家庭，不能像旧社会所形容的，一个家庭里，只要有一个人修行得道，不但全家老小，甚至连同喂的鸡、狗都能同登仙境，共享仙福。越是负责的同志，越需要有这样的自觉，更兢兢业业，运用我们掌了的权，为人民办好事。并且不能以自己如此为满足，还要以身作则，教育妻子儿女，爱劳动，爱人民，勤俭朴素，而绝不允许自己的妻子儿女成为贵族式的夫人和子弟。
    本报2月9日第五版上，登载了夏伯阳的女儿谈夏伯阳的短短的一篇通讯，说到夏伯阳当时教育子女的情形，使人亲切地感到了夏伯阳的英雄本色。每个共产党员，本来只有为人民服务的义务，没有要求额外享受的权利。我们希望李频如和高莲英同志，会在同志们和党组织的帮助下，警觉起来，改正错误。按理说，这是没有什么困难的。我们也愿趁此机会，提醒所有的同志，谨防特权思想侵入我们的日常生活，以致使我们日益脱离群众而不自觉。
