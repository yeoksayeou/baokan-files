    Deputy Political Commissar Yao and His "Family Affairs"
    Shuai Xihong, Sun Xuegui, Ding Song
    In the afternoon, from a tall and spacious house, came shouts and a woman's painful cries. The crying was so tragic that it made one's hair stand on end. This was the moment when Yao Ze, member of the CCP Hai'an County Committee in Jiangsu Province and Deputy Political Commissar of the Hai'an County Military Service Bureau, was dismissing a nanny at his residence.

    In the less than six months before this nanny was dismissed, Deputy Political Commissar Yao had dismissed more than twenty nannies. Deputy Political Commissar Yao always had some "legitimate" "reasons" for dismissing a nanny each time. These twenty-odd nannies seemed to have all become "bad" after arriving at the Yao family, with not a single one being good; they were generally "returned" within seven to ten days, and the longest time anyone stayed was only three months. This cannot but make people wonder: are the nannies really "bad," or is Deputy Political Commissar Yao difficult to serve? This suspicion must be answered by a series of facts about Deputy Political Commissar Yao's treatment of the nannies.

    Let's look at the daily work of the nannies:

    Deputy Political Commissar Yao is unwilling to pay nannies full wages. Generally, a nanny who does not eat his food only gets six yuan, and if she eats his food, she only gets four yuan. However, he has very high demands on the nannies. Let's look at the daily work he stipulates for the nannies: 1. Constantly hold the child, ensuring that it does not cry and that its weight increases continuously; 2. Be responsible for all cooking tasks in the kitchen; 3. Be responsible for cleaning all places inside and outside the house; wiping all furniture inside and outside the house; 4. Washing all the clothes and shoes of Deputy Political Commissar Yao, his wife, and children; 5. Other tasks within the scope of service, such as fetching water for washing faces, bathing, washing feet, pouring out bathwater, foot-washing water, helping Yao's wife with the chamber pot, making the bed, adding rice, pouring tea, etc. In addition to these, there are also temporary tasks. Therefore, the nannies are busy all day long, getting up at five o'clock in the morning and not stopping until after ten o'clock at night, with very little time to rest.

    A difficult child

    Deputy Political Commissar Yao's two children have rather strange temperaments. They want this after eating that, and they cry and make noise if they are a little slow. The task of "ensuring that the child does not cry" that Deputy Political Commissar Yao put forward is therefore difficult to complete. However, Deputy Political Commissar Yao does not care about this and often scolds the nanny in front of the child, making the child think that he can do whatever he wants and that the nanny can be used at will, and the child becomes more and more willful, and "accidents" become more and more frequent. One day, the nanny Xue Meifeng was taking care of the child when, with a slight lack of attention, the child fell. Not having been hurt, Deputy Political Commissar Yao stamped his feet and cursed: "This child belongs to the state, and the wages I give you are also from the state. How dare you not take responsibility?" He immediately ordered Xue Meifeng to "get out." Xue begged with tears, guaranteeing "never to do it again," but did not receive "lenient treatment." Another time, the nanny Zhang Yuanfang was sleeping with the child, and the child cried. In order to "ensure that the child did not cry," Zhang Yuanfang sat and held the child until the middle of the night, but the child was still crying. Deputy Political Commissar Yao became anxious, grabbed a pistol, rushed out of the room, kicked down the door of the nanny's room (which was a public house and has not been repaired to this day), and shouted: "You thing that deserves to die, if you don't coax the child to stop crying, I'll send you to the Public Security Bureau tomorrow to sit in jail." The nanny was not very knowledgeable and believed it to be true, and begged repeatedly in fright. But she was still fired the next day.

    Deputy Political Commissar Yao also has a set of methods, which is to weigh the child and hand it over to the nanny, and specifically stipulate how much weight it should gain each month. It is said that by using this method, the nanny would not dare to slack off. Some nannies felt that pigs could be raised well, gaining two ounces in the morning and half a pound at night, how could a person be required to gain weight in fixed amounts? If they did not admit it, they would not get the "rice bowl," so they had to admit it, but even with a hundred times the effort, they could not complete the child's weight target set by Deputy Political Commissar Yao. In this way, some "ineffective" nannies had to leave involuntarily.

    Is this an attitude towards people?

    Deputy Political Commissar Yao has always believed that nannies are hired with money. According to his logic, there is no human feeling between master and servant at all. Therefore, the nannies he uses have no right to deal with their own problems at all, and must obey his orders like cattle and horses. Once, the son of a nanny living in Hai'an town drowned and was about to die. When the nanny learned of this news, she asked Yao's wife for an hour's leave to go home and take a look. Yao's wife said: "If you hold someone's bowl, you should be under their control. You can't go back!" The nanny then asked Deputy Political Commissar Yao for leave, but the answer she got was: "If your son drowns, it's no use you going back; if he doesn't drown, there's no need to go back at all. Taking care of my child is the important thing."

    Want the horse to run fast, but not let it eat grass

    The nannies' diet in Deputy Political Commissar Yao's house is very "simple." Not only do they just eat rice without vegetables, but they are not allowed to eat much. A nanny from Huji Township was fired because she ate more. Zhang Yuanfang was in the Yao family for three months, and every day at noon she had rice soaked in boiling water with pickled vegetables. She never ate anything better than tofu soup. However, the requirements for the nanny's milk quality were very high. During spot checks, if the squeezed milk was not thick, she would be fired. One nanny, when she came, had milk that met the standards, but after a while, the milk became thin, and she was fired. Our Deputy Political Commissar Yao, in his happiness, also joked with his wife, saying that this was a manifestation of the wet nurse "degenerating and deteriorating." It really makes people wonder: if you want the horse to run fast, how can you not let it eat grass?

    "Seeing the scenery, feelings arise" and "Handling skillfully"

    Deputy Political Commissar Yao also often did "political and ideological" work for the nannies. According to his theory, those who work hard (such as nannies) should "see the scenery, feelings arise"; those who spend money (such as himself) should "handle skillfully." However, even though the nannies "see the scenery, feelings arise," they cannot make Deputy Political Commissar Yao "handle skillfully." For example, in summer, the bathwater for Deputy Political Commissar Yao and his wife was all boiled and carried to the bathroom by the nanny. If it was a little too hot, Deputy Political Commissar Yao would be furious, saying that she was wasting his fuel; if it was a little too cold, he would scold the nanny for not knowing how to do things, harming his body. Also, when Deputy Political Commissar Yao and his wife were eating, the nanny was responsible for adding rice. If a bowl of rice had been eaten and the nanny had not noticed taking the bowl to fill it, she would be accused of being "dumb and wooden." In terms of preparing dishes, the nanny used all her ingenuity, but the dishes she made were either too bland or fishy, etc. In short, there was something to complain about, saying: "Poor people have shallow roots, they don't have fish and meat to eat, how can they prepare side dishes?"

    What do Deputy Political Commissar Yao's "family affairs" show? In his own words to judge the nanny: it is a manifestation of "degeneration and deterioration."

    姚副政委和他的“家事”
    帅锡宏、孙学贵、丁松
    下午，从一幢高大而宽敞的房子里，传出了吆喝声和女人的痛哭声。那哭声悲切得使人毛骨悚然。这就是中共江苏省海安县委委员、海安县兵役局副政委姚泽同志正在自己的住宅里解雇保姆的时刻。
    在这个保姆被解雇之前不到半年的时间内，经姚副政委的手解雇的保姆已经有二十余名。姚副政委每次解雇一个保姆时，总有一些
  “正当”的“理由”。这二十余名保姆，好像到了姚家都变“坏”了，没有一个好的；一般的七天至十天就被“验退”，时间最长的只有一个人，也不过三个月。这就不能不使人产生这样的怀疑：到底是保姆“坏”呢，还是姚副政委难服侍呢？这个怀疑得由姚副政委对待保姆的一系列的事实来回答。
    看看保姆的日常工作吧
    姚副政委找保姆是不肯给足工资的，一般的保姆不吃他的饭只得六元，吃他的饭只得四元。但他对保姆的要求却是很高的，看看他给保姆规定的日常工作吧：1、小孩要经常抱着，保证不哭，使其体重不断增加；2、负责炊事房的一切炊事任务；3、负责打扫宅内外一切地方；洗抹房内外一切家具；4、洗涤姚副政委和他爱人、小孩的一切衣履；5、其他属于服侍范围内的任务，比如打洗脸水、洗澡水、洗脚水，倒洗澡水、洗脚水、替姚的妻子倒马桶、摊铺盖、添饭、倒茶等等。除此以外还有临时性的任务。因此，保姆整天忙碌不停，从早上五点钟起身，直到夜间十多点钟，很少有时间休息。
    难带的孩子
    姚副政委的两个孩子脾气挺别扭，吃了这样想那样，慢了一点就大哭大闹。姚副政委提出“保证孩子不哭”的任务因此很难完成。可是姚副政委不管这些，经常当着孩子的面怒骂保姆，使孩子以为自己可以为所欲为，而保姆可以任意支使，孩子越来越任性，“事故”也就越来越多。一天，保姆薛美凤带着孩子，稍不注意，孩子跌了一跤，并不曾受伤，姚副政委竟顿足大骂：“这孩子是国家的，我给你的工钱也是国家的，你敢不负责任吗？”当即责令薛美凤“滚蛋”，薛含泪乞求，保证“决不再犯”，也没有得到
  “宽大处理”。又有一次保姆张远芳带着小孩睡觉，小孩啼哭，张远芳为了“保证孩子不哭”，便坐着抱孩子，直到下半夜，孩子还是哭，姚副政委急了，手持短枪，冲出房来，一脚踢坏保姆房门（是公家的房子，至今尚未修好），厉声大骂：“要死的东西，如果再不哄住孩子，明天就送你到公安局坐牢”。保姆见识不广，信以为真，吓得连声哀求。可是第二天仍然被解雇了。
    姚副政委还有一套办法，就是将小孩称一下交给保姆，并具体规定每月长多重。据说，运用这个办法，保姆就不敢懈怠，有些保姆觉得猪子养得好，可以日长四两夜长半斤，人怎么能规定斤两呢？不承认吧，“饭碗”不得到手，只好承认下来，可是百倍的努力，还不能完成姚副政委所规定的小孩体重指标。这样，一些“工作不力”的保姆就不得不被迫离去。
    这是对人的态度吗
    姚副政委一向总认为保姆是拿钱雇的。按照他的逻辑，主仆之间根本就不存在人情。因此，他用的保姆根本就没有一丝权利处理自己的问题，完全要像牛马一样听他使唤。有一次，住在海安本镇的一个保姆的儿子溺水将死，保姆得知这消息，向姚的爱人请假一个钟头回家看一下。姚的爱人说：“捧了人家碗，该受人家管，回去不得！”保姆又向姚副政委请假，可是得到的回答却是：“你儿子如果淹死了，你回去也没有用；如果没有淹死，根本用不着回去，带好我这小孩是要紧的事。”
    要马儿不吃草，还要马儿走得好
    姚副政委的保姆饮食都是很“朴素”的，光吃饭不吃菜还不算，还不准多吃。胡集乡有个保姆就因为吃得较多而被解雇。张远芳在姚家三个月，每天中午都是开水泡饭，咸菜过口，从来也没有吃过豆腐汤以上的菜。但对保姆的乳质要求却很高，在抽查时，挤下的乳如果不浓，就要解雇。有一个保姆，来时验乳合规格，过些时，乳薄了，便被解雇。我们的姚副政委在快乐之余还和他爱人打趣说：这是奶妈“蜕化变质”的表现。真使人不解：要马儿不吃草，怎能再叫马儿走得好呢？
    “见景生情”和“得心应手”
    姚副政委也常对保姆做“政治思想”工作。按照他的理论，出力的人（如保姆之类）就要“见景生情”；出钱的人（如他本人）就要
  “得心应手”。可是，尽管保姆们是“见景生情”的，也不能使姚副政委“得心应手”。比如夏天，姚副政委夫妻二人的洗澡水都是由保姆烧好端着送到洗澡室的，稍微烫点，姚副政委就大发雷霆说浪费了他的燃料；稍微凉点，又骂保姆不会做事，伤害了他的身体。又如姚副政委夫妻二人吃饭时都是由保姆负责添饭的，如果一碗饭已吃完，保姆不曾注意到拿碗去盛时，就会被指责为“痴眼木呆”。在办菜方面，保姆用尽心机，做出来的菜不是嫌淡，就是腥气等等，总之有个嫌处，说：“穷人根底浅，没得鱼肉吃，怎会办小菜？”
    姚副政委的“家事”说明了什么呢？用他自己评判保姆的话来说：是一种“蜕化变质”的表现。
