The Ministry of Construction Engineering has preliminarily formulated a new technology plan for saving steel, cement, and wood in construction and design in 1957. The plan stipulates that this year, approximately more than 10,000 tons of steel will be saved, accounting for more than 5% of the annual steel consumption; more than 100,000 tons of cement will be saved, accounting for 14.3% of the annual cement consumption; and approximately 60,000 cubic meters of wood will be saved, accounting for 7.5% of the annual wood consumption.

The main new technology measures to be promoted in construction this year include: prestressed reinforced concrete, planned to be promoted for more than 30,000 cubic meters; steel-bamboo reinforced concrete, planned to be promoted for more than 400,000 square meters; and extensive use of cold-rolled, cold-drawn, and cold-drawn steel bars, as well as spot welding and butt welding, to save steel; in terms of saving cement, using non-clinker cement, cement admixtures, and dry-hard concrete; and using bamboo for formwork, scaffolding, and quick demolding methods to save wood.

There are a total of thirty-six new technology projects to be promoted in design, the main ones being the further adoption of prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and prefabricated prestressed reinforced concrete structures in industrial buildings to replace steel structures. For example, using a 24-meter prestressed truss can save about 40% of steel consumption per truss compared to a steel roof truss; using reinforced concrete skylights only consumes 25.07 kilograms of steel per truss, while steel skylights consume 191 kilograms of steel per truss. The implementation of these new technology plans will greatly facilitate steel saving efforts.

The Ministry of Construction Engineering requires construction and design units to strictly ensure project quality while implementing the new technology plan, and to fully consider the specific conditions of each region and project, formulate specific implementation plans, and ensure that the prescribed savings targets are met and exceeded. While implementing the new technology plan, all units must pay attention to improving material management, extensively carry out mass movements to save materials, and resolutely overcome the phenomenon of saving materials on one hand while wasting materials on the other.

In 1956, construction units and design departments under the Ministry of Construction Engineering achieved remarkable results in saving construction materials. Last year, seven design institutes saved a total of more than 12,400 tons of steel, more than 30,700 tons of cement, and more than 2,500 cubic meters of wood by implementing new technology measures and rationalization proposals. In terms of construction, steel savings alone exceeded 7,000 tons. The four general engineering management bureaus in Northeast, North China, Central South, and Southwest China saved a total of 5,016 tons of steel, 36,618 tons of cement, and 43,926 cubic meters of wood throughout the year. The two engineering companies with the best savings performance, Northeast Second and Third, saved 15.9% of their total steel consumption, 25.6% of their total cement consumption, and 24% of their total wood consumption. The construction materials saved by these two companies can be used to build an additional 120,000 square meters of factory buildings. Last year, in the absence of new technology equipment, many construction workers studied and created some simple and easy-to-use machines and operating methods. For example, in the absence of cold rolling mills, a new fixture was used on the cold drawing machine to enable cold drawing of rough steel bars; another example is the use of a mixer to modify a ball mill, creating convenient conditions for the use of non-clinker cement; the use of double-roll core molds on prefabricated hollow floor slabs increased the formwork turnover rate to over 140 times, greatly reducing wood consumption.

Judging from the construction material savings situation last year, as long as leadership is strengthened and the creativity and initiative of the vast number of workers are fully utilized, and all kinds of methods are tried to save raw materials in construction projects, the potential is great. At present, ensuring the supply of various machines and equipment required for the implementation of new technologies according to plan is another key issue in the work of saving construction materials. Recently, the Ministry of Construction Engineering is working with relevant parties to solve this problem. Some cold rolling mills and ball mills have begun manufacturing, and these machines will be supplied to various construction sites one after another.

    建筑工程部决定推行施工设计新技术
    全年可节省万吨钢材和大量木材水泥
    本报讯　建筑工程部初步拟定1957年在施工和设计方面节省钢材、水泥、木材的新技术计划。这个计划中规定：今年要节省钢材约一万多吨，占全年钢材用量的5％以上；节省水泥十万多吨，占全年水泥用量的14.3％；节省木材约六万立方公尺，占全年木材用量的7.5％。
    今年计划在施工方面推广的新技术措施，主要有：预加应力钢筋混凝土，计划推广三万多立方公尺；钢筋加竹筋混凝土，计划推广四十多万平方公尺；大量采用钢筋冷轧、冷拉、冷拔和点焊、对焊，以节约钢材；在节约水泥方面，采用无熟料水泥、水泥掺合料和干硬性混凝土；并且利用竹材做模板、脚手架和采用快速脱模法等，以节约木材。
    在设计方面推广的新技术项目共有三十六项，其中主要的是在工业建筑上要进一步采用装配式钢筋混凝土结构和装配式预加应力钢筋混凝土结构，以代替钢结构。例如，采用二十四公尺的预加应力桁架，每榀耗钢量比钢屋架可节省钢材约40％；采用钢筋混凝土天窗，每榀耗钢量只需二十五点零七公斤，如果采用钢制天窗，每榀要消耗钢材一百九十一公斤。这些新技术计划的推行，将会大大有利于钢材的节约工作。
    建筑工程部要求施工和设计单位在执行新技术计划中，必须严格保证工程质量，并且要充分考虑各地区、各工程的具体条件，拟订出具体的实施计划，保证达到并且争取超过规定的节约指标。要各单位在贯彻新技术计划的同时，注意改善材料的管理，深入广泛地开展群众性的节约材料的运动，坚决克服一面节约材料、一面浪费材料的现象。
    1956年，建筑工程部所属施工单位和设计部门，在节约建筑材料方面曾经取得了显著成绩。七个设计院去年由于执行了新技术措施和合理化建议，共节省了钢材一万二千四百余吨、水泥三万零七百余吨、木材二千五百多立方公尺。在施工方面，仅钢材一项即节约七千多吨。东北、华北、中南、西南四个工程管理总局全年共节省钢材五千零一十六吨、水泥三万六千六百一十八吨、木材四万三千九百二十六立方公尺。节约成绩最好的东北第二、三两个工程公司，节省的钢材占总用量的15.9％，节省的水泥占总用量的25.6％，节省的木材占总用量的24％。这两个公司节省的建筑材料，可以用来多建十 二万平方公尺的厂房。去年在缺乏新技术设备的情况下，许多建筑职工钻研创造了一些简便易行的机具和操作方法。如缺乏冷轧机，就在冷拉钢筋机上利用一种新的夹具，使粗钢筋也能冷拉；又如利用搅拌机改装球磨机，为采用无熟料水泥创造了便利的条件；在预制空心楼板上采用双滚蕊模，使模板周转率达到一百四十次以上，使木材的消耗大大减少。
    从去年建筑材料节约的情况来看，只要加强领导，充分地发挥广大职工的创造性和主动性，千方百计地想各种各样的办法，在建筑工程上节约原材料的潜力是很大的。目前，按计划保证供应推行新技术所需的各种机具设备，是建筑材料节约工作的另一个关键问题。最近期间，建筑工程部正在协同有关方面努力解决这个问题。一部分冷轧机和球磨机已经开始制造，这些机器不久将陆续供应各工地。
