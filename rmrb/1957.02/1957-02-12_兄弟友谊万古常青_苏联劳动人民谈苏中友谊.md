Brotherly Friendship Lasts Forever
——Soviet Working People Talk About Sino-Soviet Friendship——

Pouring out Friendship Wholeheartedly
　　Pilugin, Worker at the Moscow Electric Bulb Factory: Seven years have passed since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The great friendship between the people of our two countries is becoming more and more solid year by year, and the clear and enthusiastic friendship is expressed more and more every day. Take our Moscow Electric Bulb Factory as an example. In 1955, some Chinese comrades came to our factory to study. They were very friendly and treated us with a fraternal trust. They always listened carefully to the explanations of our engineers and workers. And we also spared no time and effort to help the Chinese comrades become familiar with the technological process and the characteristics of the equipment. When we learned that the state-owned Beijing Electronic Tube Factory had started operation, we were very happy. We are glad that we have made a modest contribution to the great cause of China's industrialization. We manufactured various equipment for this factory, helped with installation, and helped train experts. We carefully preserve a red flag given to us by our Chinese friends when the state-owned Beijing Electronic Tube Factory started operation.
　　I will never forget January 17, 1957. On this day, a mass rally of friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China was held in the Moscow Kremlin. I was very fortunate to represent the workers of Moscow in welcoming the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China. I was very excited at the time, and I wholeheartedly poured out the feelings of the Soviet people for the Chinese workers. I believe that any other Soviet worker, if placed in my position, would have spoken so enthusiastically.

Friendship is Consolidated and Solid as a Rock
　　Dikan, Lathe Operator at the Kharkov Tractor Factory and Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: We Soviet people cherish the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China very much. As long as this friendship exists, we are not afraid of any conspiracies of the aggressors.
　　The joint statement of the Sino-Soviet talks in January further illustrates that our friendship is eternal and as solid as granite. We Soviet workers must do everything in our power to help the People's China carry out socialist construction and create a strong industry. Our factory is designing for the Luoyang, China's first tractor factory, and the most outstanding engineers are participating in this design. We feel extremely honored to be able to participate in this work.

Close Cooperation of Scientists
　　Bayishev, Vice President of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh Republic: The Kazakh people, like other ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, highly value the brotherly friendship and cooperation with the great neighbor China. This friendship is growing day by day, and the expanding cooperation between scientists in Soviet Kazakhstan and China is also a vivid example.
　　In recent years, many Kazakh scientists have visited China, and our Chinese counterparts and other cultural workers have also visited our republic many times. For example, in 1956, Chinese geologists came to our republic to study the work experience of geological science institutions. Not long ago, workers in Chinese higher education also visited our republic. In addition, the Kazakh Academy of Sciences has exchange relations with many scientific institutions in China, such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing Library. In the past three or four years alone, we have sent more than 2,500 copies of the works of outstanding representatives of Kazakh people's culture to China. At the same time, we also received more than 4,500 books from China.
　　The joint statement between the Soviet Union and China in January this year opened up unlimited new possibilities for our closer cooperation in political, economic, and cultural aspects. This is something that makes every Soviet person very happy. May our cooperation in science and culture become more extensive and more in-depth in the future!

Friendship That Is Difficult to Express in Words
　　Brizhiko, Section Chief of the Dimitrov Mine in Donbas, Hero of Socialist Labor: The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China is difficult to express in words. When Soviet and Chinese friends meet, you can feel how sincere and warm this friendship is. This noble feeling comes from the bottom of the heart. Because the people of our two countries have a common great goal—to struggle for the bright future of all mankind.
　　Last year, two Chinese delegations came to our mine to visit. They came to our place to talk with the miners and see how we work. Now I can tell our Chinese comrades: The miners in our section have overfulfilled last year's socialist competition task by one time and given the country 25,400 tons of coal beyond the plan. I think you will be happy to hear that.
　　Whenever we hear about new achievements made by our Chinese friends, our hearts are filled with joy and pride. Dear Chinese comrades, this is because our friendship is sincere and eternal. Let us jointly and continuously consolidate this friendship and increase the strength of our two brotherly countries with selfless labor!

Thoughts and Hopes of an Old Friend
　　Varbakhovsky, Captain of the "Polina Osipenko" Ship: Our sea-going vessels often travel between the seaports of the Soviet Union and China. The sailors of the Soviet Far East and the working people of great China have always had close and friendly ties. After the Chinese people embarked on the road of socialist construction, this friendship has grown even more. Our sailors are concerned about the achievements of our Chinese friends and sincerely rejoice in their success.
　　Since 1945, I have often sailed between the Soviet Union and China. I have been to Dalian, Qingdao, Shanghai and other places many times. I still remember Shanghai during the Kuomintang era. At that time, dirty Shanghai was full of foreigners who considered themselves to be the masters. I also remember the unemployed crowds, the wandering children, and the disparity between the rich and the poor that surprised my generation of Soviet people. All of this is over. Now Shanghai has completely changed. In this neat, clean, and well-equipped city, there are no more flamboyant advertisements, and brothels and casinos have disappeared. And, most importantly, people have changed. The national pride and dignity that was suppressed by the imperialists in the past has been expressed.
　　Not long ago, our ship was repaired in Dalian. Soviet and Chinese sailors worked side by side on the repair work. As many Chinese comrades have said: "We help each other in all aspects." Our ship is about to depart again. All the personnel on our ship are happy to meet our Chinese friends frequently.

We Are Like-minded Brothers
　　Jemidov, High-Speed Lathe Operator at the Minsk Automobile Factory: The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, who account for almost one-third of mankind, is becoming more and more consolidated day by day. The people of our two countries are like-minded brothers, and we are moving forward bravely and with confidence. No matter how the imperialists slander us, no matter what alliances they form to oppose us, and no matter what "isms" they put forward, they cannot shake the confidence of ordinary people around the world in our great goals, nor will they stop the powerful movement of the people in colonies and semi-colonies to strive for national independence.
　　Dear spiritual and business brothers, we Soviet people attach great importance to the friendship between us. There are many Chinese interns in enterprises in Minsk, the capital of our republic. Automatic dump trucks produced in Belarus can also be seen on your construction sites. I am very happy that I have been helping the Chinese people in their cause of building socialism in some small way.

Cherishing the Great Friendship
　　Zagaerchinov, Doctor of History at the Academy of Sciences of the Kyrgyz Republic: The Kyrgyz Republic borders fraternal China. There are many things in common in the fate of the great Chinese working people and the Kyrgyz people. The ordinary people of the two countries have maintained friendly ties since ancient times. After the victory of the Chinese revolution, this connection became even more consolidated.
　　The Soviet people cherish the friendship with the great Chinese people very much and protect it like the apple of their eye. Because the people of our country know that Sino-Soviet friendship is a guarantee of peace.

Best Friends and Brothers
　　Obukhov, Lathe Operator in the Mechanical Workshop of the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant: I am an ordinary worker and have been a worker for nearly twenty-five years. The idea of friendship between the people of our Soviet Union and China is deeply rooted in the hearts of the Ural workers. In January this year, when the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China came to the Soviet Union, the news immediately spread throughout the factory and throughout our city of machine manufacturers—Sverdlovsk. I remember that no matter where you went, whether it was in the workers' chats during shift changes, in the cultural palace of the factory, at the tram stop, or when visiting neighbors, you could hear people saying, "Our best friends, our brothers are here!"
　　Soviet workers regard helping Chinese friends to industrialize the country as their duty. Therefore, we pay special attention to and feel honored to complete the orders of our Chinese friends. Now our workshop is working with great enthusiasm to complete the Chinese order. We are manufacturing huge rolling mills and other machine parts. I complete 200% to 240% of the quota every day. Many of our workers have also achieved such high targets. This is a sincere manifestation of our friendship.

May Friendship Be Like a Blooming Garden
　　Torubeyev, Actor of the Pushkin Theater in Leningrad, People's Artist of the Soviet Union: I am happy and fortunate to have seen the fascinating performances of Chinese actors more than once. I know that our two countries have signed a cultural cooperation agreement for 1957. Our cultural exchanges will become more extensive, which will further strengthen our friendship and enrich our creative experience. Every Soviet actor wants to go to China, and we are also very happy to receive Chinese friends.
　　May the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China be like the most beautiful blooming garden! (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    兄弟友谊万古常青
    ——苏联劳动人民谈苏中友谊——
    全心全意倾吐友情
    莫斯科电灯泡制造厂工人皮卢金　苏中友好同盟互助条约签订到现在已经七周年了。我们两国人民的伟大友谊一年比一年巩固，鲜明的热诚的友谊也一天多似一天地表现出来。就拿我们莫斯科电灯泡制造厂为例吧，1955年曾有一些中国同志来我们工厂学习。他们十分亲热，以一种对兄弟的信任态度对待我们，总是很注意地听取我们的工程师和工人们的讲解。而我们也是毫不吝惜时间和精力，帮助中国同志们熟习工艺过程和设备的特点。当我们知道国营北京电子管厂已经开工的时候，我们非常高兴。我们高兴在中国工业化的伟大事业中有我们的一份微薄的贡献。我们曾为这个厂制造了各种设备，帮助安装，帮助培养了专家。我们小心地保存着中国朋友们当国营北京电子管厂开工时赠给我们的一面红旗。
    我终生难忘1957年1月17日。这一天，在莫斯科克里姆林宫里举行了苏中两国人民友好群众大会。我曾非常幸运地代表莫斯科的劳动者向中华人民共和国政府代表团致了欢迎词。当时我非常激动，我全心全意地倾吐出苏联人民对中国劳动者的感情。我相信，其他任何一个苏联工人，如果处在我的境地，都会这样热情地讲话的。
    友谊巩固坚如磐石
    哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂旋工、苏联最高苏维埃代表狄干　我们苏联人非常珍重苏中两国人民的友谊。只要这种友谊存在，我们就不怕侵略者的任何阴谋。
    今年1月苏中会谈的联合声明，更进一步说明我们的友谊是永恒的，它像花岗石般的坚固。我们苏联工人要尽一切力量帮助人民中国进行社会主义建设，创立强大的工业。我们工厂正在为洛阳中国第一个拖拉机制造厂进行设计工作，参加这个设计的都是我们最优秀的工程师。我们以能参加这件工作感到极大的光荣。
    科学家的亲密合作
    哈萨克共和国科学院副院长巴依舍夫　哈萨克人民和苏联其他各族人民一样，非常珍视同伟大的邻邦中国的兄弟般友谊和合作。这种友谊正在一天天增长，苏维埃哈萨克斯坦和中国科学家之间的日益扩大的合作，也是鲜明的实例之一。
    近几年来，有许多哈萨克的科学家到过中国，而我们的中国同行和其他文化工作者也曾多次来到我们共和国。例如，1956年中国的地质学家们曾来我们共和国研究地质科学机关的工作经验。不久以前，中国的高等教育工作者也到我们共和国访问过。此外，哈萨克科学院同中国的许多科学机关，如中国科学院、北京图书馆等，都有交换关系。仅近三、四年间，我们就寄往中国二千五百多册哈萨克人民文化优秀代表者的著作。同时，我们也从中国收到了四千五百多册书籍。
    今年1月苏中两国的联合声明为我们在政治、经济、文化方面更密切的合作开辟了无限新的可能性。这是使每一个苏联人都非常高兴的事。愿今后我们在科学和文化方面的合作更加广泛，更加深入！
    言语难以表达的情谊
    顿巴斯季米特洛夫矿井工段长、社会主义劳动英雄布里吉科　苏中两国人民的友情是很难用言语表达出来的。当苏联和中国的朋友们见面时，可以感到这种友情是多么真诚，多么温暖。这种高尚的感情是从心底涌出来的。因为我们两国人民有着共同的伟大目标——为全人类的光辉未来而奋斗。
    去年，有两个中国代表团曾到我们矿井来参观。他们来到我们这里同矿工们谈话，看我们怎样工作。现在我可以告诉我们的中国同志：我们工段的矿工已超额一倍完成了去年的社会主义竞赛任务，超计划给了国家二万五千四百吨煤。我想你们听到后也会高兴吧。
    我们每当听到中国朋友获得新成就的时候，心中都充满了喜悦和自豪。亲爱的中国同志们，这是因为我们之间的友谊是真挚的，永恒的。让我们共同不断地巩固这种友谊，以忘我地劳动增加我们两个兄弟国家的力量吧！
    老朋友的感想和希望
    “波里那·奥西平科”号轮船船长瓦尔巴霍夫斯基　我们的海轮是经常行驶在苏联和中国的海港之间的。苏联远东的海员和伟大中国的劳动人民一向是有着亲密的友好联系的。当中国人民走上社会主义建设的道路以后，这种友谊就更加增长了。我们海员们关心中国朋友的成就，衷心地为他们的成功而高兴。
    从1945年起，我就经常航行在苏联和中国之间了。我曾多次到过大连、青岛、上海等地。我还记得国民党时期的上海。当时肮脏的上海充满了一些认为自己是主人的外国人。我还记得那失业的人群，流浪的儿童，记得那使我这一代苏联人感到奇怪的贫富之间的悬殊。这一切都过去了。现在上海的面目已完全变了。在这个整齐清洁、设备良好的城市里，再也看不见大吹大擂的广告，妓院和赌场也绝迹了。还有，最主要的是人们都变了，过去为帝国主义者所压抑的民族的自豪和尊严，已经表现了出来。
    不久以前，我们的船曾在大连检修。苏中海员在一道并肩从事修理工作。正如许多中国同志们所说的：“我们在各方面都互相帮助。”我们的船又快要出发了。我们船上的全体人员都高兴能同中国朋友们经常见面。
    我们是思想一致的兄弟
    明斯克汽车工厂高速旋工皆米道夫几乎占全人类三分之一的苏中两国人民的友谊一天天巩固着。我们两国人民是思想一致的兄弟，我们勇敢地满怀信心地前进着。无论帝国主义者怎样诽谤我们，无论他们制造什么同盟来反对我们，也无论他们提出什么“主义”，都不能动摇全世界普通人对我们的伟大目标的信心，也不会阻止住殖民地和半殖民地人民争取民族独立的强大运动的发展。
    亲爱的精神上和事业上的兄弟们，我们苏联人非常重视我们之间的友谊。我们共和国的首都明斯克的企业里，就有不少中国实习生。白俄罗斯出产的自动卸货卡车，也可以在你们的建筑工地上看到。我很高兴自己多多少少总算在帮助中国人民建设社会主义的事业。
    珍视伟大的友谊
    吉尔吉斯共和国科学院历史学博士扎盖尔奇诺夫　吉尔吉斯共和国和兄弟中国接壤。在伟大的中国劳动人民和吉尔吉斯人民的命运中，有许多共同的地方。两国普通人民从古代起就保持着友好联系。中国革命胜利后，这种联系更加巩固起来了。
    苏联人民非常珍视同伟大的中国人民的友谊，并像保护眼珠一样保护着它。因为我国人民知道，苏中友谊是和平的保证。
    最好的朋友和兄弟
    乌拉尔重型机器制造厂机械车间旋工奥布霍夫　我是一个普通工人，已当了将近二十五年的工人。我们苏中两国人民友好的思想，是深入乌拉尔工人心中的。今年1月，当中华人民共和国政府代表团来到苏联的时候，消息立刻传遍了全厂，传遍了我们这个机器制造者的城市——斯维德洛夫斯克。我记得，无论在哪儿，换班时工人们的闲谈中，工厂的文化宫里，电车站上，或者在邻居家作客的时候，到处都听见人们说：“我们最好的朋友，我们的兄弟来了！”
    苏联工人把帮助中国朋友进行国家工业化，看做是自己的职责。所以，中国朋友的订货，我们是特别注意的，是感到光荣的。现在我们车间就正在以巨大的热情为完成中国订货而工作着。我们正在制造巨大的轧钢机和其他机器的部件。我每天完成的工作达到定额的200％至240％。我们还有不少工人也都达到了这样高的指标。这就是我们的友情的真诚表现。
    愿友谊像盛开的花园
    列宁格勒普希金剧院演员、苏联人民演员托鲁别耶夫　我感到高兴而又幸福的是，自己曾不止一次看到过中国演员的迷人的演出。我知道，我们两国1957年的文化合作协定已签了字。我们的文化交流将更加广泛起来，这会进一步加强我们的友谊，丰富我们的创造经验。我们每一个苏联演员都想到中国去，同时也非常乐意接待中国朋友。
    愿苏中人民的友谊像最美丽的盛开的花园一样！（本报特约稿）
