Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, February 16th. In addition to the 51 projects currently under construction, Anshan Iron and Steel Company will commence another 37 projects this year.

The construction plan formulated by Anshan Iron and Steel Company this year focuses on the weaker links in this ferrous metallurgical complex – the mine raw material system. Within this system are the Gongchangling and Dong Anshan iron mines, the ore preparation plant, the Dagushan flotation plant, the Anshan new sintering plant, the Qingshanhuai magnesite mine, and the Ganjingzi limestone mine. These large-scale modern factories and mines are expected to be put into production this year and in the next few years, respectively, and the production capacity of iron ore can be increased by two times compared with last year.

Major projects are also under construction in the ironmaking and steelmaking systems. The six large blast furnaces that the First Five-Year Plan stipulated to be renovated in Anshan will all be completed in the second quarter of this year.

A total of eight new and renovated rolling mills will be built this year. After these projects are put into production this year or next year, they will produce a large number of steel plates, large steel products, steel pipes, steel ropes, steel wires, etc., which are of great significance to the development of my country's locomotive, shipbuilding, automobile, tractor, construction and other industries.

The construction of auxiliary production departments such as coke ovens has reached an unprecedented scale this year. My country's four larger coke ovens and a recovery plant project can be completed this year, and Anshan Iron and Steel's coke production capacity will increase by more than 50% compared with last year.

The employees of Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, who are undertaking the above-mentioned construction tasks, are speeding up construction in the severe cold; the preparatory work for the projects that have not yet started is also underway. A total of 62 large and small projects are planned to be completed this year; another 17 projects will be partially put into production.

    鞍钢大规模建设原料系统的厂矿
    炼铁、炼钢和炼焦的重大工程正在施工
    新华社鞍山16日电　鞍山钢铁公司今年除了目前正在施工的五十一项工程以外，还有三十七项将陆续动工。
    鞍山钢铁公司制定的今年建设计划，是以这个黑色冶金联合企业较薄弱的环节——矿山原料系统为重点的。在这个系统里，有弓长岭、东鞍山铁矿和矿石准备总厂、大孤山浮游选矿厂、鞍山新烧结厂、青山怀镁矿、甘井子石灰石矿等。这些规模巨大的现代化厂矿，预计在今年和再过几年分别投入生产以后，铁矿石的生产能力可以比去年增长两倍。
    炼铁和炼钢系统现在也有重大的工程在施工。第一个五年计划规定在鞍山改建的六座大型高炉，今年第二季度就可以全部完成了。
    今年新建和改建的各种轧钢厂共有八个，这些工程在今年或明后年投入生产以后，将大量生产钢板、大型钢材、钢管、钢绳、钢丝等，这对我国的机车、船舶、汽车、拖拉机、建筑等工业的发展有重大意义。
    炼焦炉等辅助生产部门的建设，今年达到了空前的规模。我国较大的四座炼焦炉和一座回收厂工程，今年内就可以竣工，鞍钢生产焦炭的能力将比去年提高50％以上。
    承担上述工程建设任务的鞍山冶金建筑总公司的职工们，正冒着严寒加速施工；尚未开工的工程准备工作，也在紧张进行。今年内计划建成的大小工程共有六十二个；还有十七个工程将部分投入生产。
