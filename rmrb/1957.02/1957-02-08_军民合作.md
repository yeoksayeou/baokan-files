    Military-Civilian Cooperation
    A certain island on the coastal defense frontline is a place lacking fresh water and fertilizer. Before the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, residents on the island rarely grew vegetables. Now, encouraged and assisted by the stationed troops, they are actively growing vegetables and have signed a "Vegetable Production and Sales Contract" with the troops. According to the contract: the troops help the agricultural cooperative dig ditches to store water and accumulate fertilizer; the cooperative supplies vegetables to the military and civilians on the island at a reasonable price agreed upon by both parties. After the contract was signed, thanks to the joint efforts of the military and civilians, vegetable harvests have been abundant throughout the year, not only ensuring the vegetable supply for the stationed troops and residents on the island, but also greatly increasing the income of the agricultural cooperative members.

    军民合作
    海防前线某岛是个缺乏淡水和肥料的地方，在没有建立农业社以前，岛上居民很少种植蔬菜。现在他们在驻军的鼓励和帮助下，积极种植蔬菜，并和驻军签订了“蔬菜产销合同”。根据合同规定：部队帮助农业社挖沟蓄水和积肥；合作社按照双方议定的合理价格供应岛上军民蔬菜。合同签订后，由于军民双方共同努力，一年来，蔬菜连获丰收，不但保证了岛上驻军和居民的蔬菜供应，农业社社员们的收入也大大增加了。（附图片）
