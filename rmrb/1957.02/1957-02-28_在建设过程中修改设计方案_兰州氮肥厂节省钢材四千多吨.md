In the process of construction, modifying the design plan, the Lanzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant saves more than 4,000 tons of steel.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Chemical Industry inspected and revised the engineering design plan for the Lanzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, saving the state four thousand to four thousand five hundred tons of steel. This amount of steel is enough to build a phosphate fertilizer plant with an annual output of 400,000 tons of superphosphate, or an electrolysis plant with an annual output of 40,000 tons of caustic soda, 30,000 tons of 666, and 6,000 tons of DDT.
    The modification of this engineering design was carried out after relevant personnel from the Ministry's capital construction and design departments conducted in-depth inspections of the construction site, fully studied the various possibilities for savings, absorbed the construction experience of the Jilin Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, and solicited opinions from Soviet experts and technical personnel from production, construction, and other relevant parties. It was determined and implemented on the premise of ensuring the structural strength of the buildings, the lifespan of the buildings, and not affecting the production process conditions of the factory after completion.
    The specific content of the modifications to the steel structure factory buildings can be roughly divided into three categories: First, they carefully studied Lanzhou's climate, rainfall, and winter temperatures, and changed the originally designed coal storage warehouse to an open-air storage, and cancelled the desulfurization section, conversion section and other factory buildings that could be omitted, saving more than 600 tons of steel in these few items alone. Second, changing steel structure factory buildings to reinforced concrete structures, the copper ammonia liquid washing section, synthetic ammonia section, and air separation unit and other three structural projects saved more than 1,200 tons of steel after modification. Third, some steel structure parts inside the factory buildings were changed to reinforced concrete structures, saving an average of about 25% of steel compared to the original design.
    The above only covers the modification of steel structure factory buildings and other aspects, saving four thousand to four thousand five hundred tons of steel. According to calculations by relevant units of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, in addition to factory building structures, there is still potential for saving in some steel equipment in this factory, which needs to be further explored.

### 在建设过程中修改设计方案  兰州氮肥厂节省钢材四千多吨

    在建设过程中修改设计方案
    兰州氮肥厂节省钢材四千多吨
    本报讯　化学工业部检查修改兰州氮肥厂的工程设计方案，为国家节约了四千吨至四千五百吨钢材。这些钢材足够建设一座年产四十万吨过磷酸钙的磷肥厂，或建设一座年产四万吨烧碱、三万吨六六六、六千吨滴滴涕的电解厂用的全部钢材。
    这个工程设计的修改工作，是经过该部基本建设、设计等方面有关人员深入工地进行了检查，充分地研究了各种节约的可能性，吸取了吉林氮肥厂的建厂经验，并征求了苏联专家以及生产和施工等有关方面技术人员的意见；在保证建筑物结构强度、建筑物寿命和不影响工厂建成后生产工艺条件等前提下，确定和进行的。
    关于钢结构厂房修改的具体内容大体可分三类：一，他们仔细研究了兰州的气候、雨量和冬季气温等情况，把原设计的储煤仓库改为露天库，取消了脱硫工段、变换工段等可要可不要的厂房建筑，仅这几项就可节约六百多吨钢材。二，把钢结构厂房改为钢筋混凝土的结构，铜氨液洗涤工段，合成氨工段和空分车等三项结构工程修改后就节约了钢材一千二百多吨。三，厂房内部的某些钢结构部分改为钢筋混凝土结构，比原设计普遍节约钢材25％左右。
    以上只是修改钢结构厂房等方面，就节约了四千至四千五百吨钢材。根据化学工业部的有关单位的计算，除厂房结构等以外，这个工厂有些钢制设备也还存在着节约的潜在力量，需要进一步挖掘。
