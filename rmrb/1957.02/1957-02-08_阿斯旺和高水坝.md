Aswan and the High Dam
By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun

The farther south you travel along the Nile, the narrower the cultivated land on both banks becomes. The two continuous, bare mountain ranges standing on either side restrict the area that the Nile can irrigate. In some places, the mountains press right to the riverbank, and farmers can only sow on the sloping riverbanks, on the layer of fertile soil left behind after the river floods. The struggle between man and nature is truly harsh here!

Besides the mud-brick houses, there are houses built from local stone, taken from the mountains, which look neater. Apparently, to avoid wasting farmland, many villages are built on bare sandy hills. Probably to avoid the hot winds from the southern desert, many houses have their doors facing north. Some houses have a dome-shaped roof made of mud bricks, plastered with yellow mud on the outside. More houses have roofs made of mud bricks in the shape of boat awnings, which look very distinctive.

The crops here are also significantly different from those in Lower Egypt, the Nile Delta. Sorghum seems to be an important crop here, and farmers use sorghum stalks to build fences and mud walls. Large areas of sugarcane are planted in the fields, and they are currently being harvested. Sugarcane is transported to sugar refineries in large carts. In towns and cities, you can often see Christian churches with crosses. These are the churches of the Coptic people, a minority in Egypt. The Coptic population is larger in Upper Egypt, and they are said to be descendants of the ancient Egyptians. Their numbers are said to be one to three million. They are better educated and wealthier. Imperialists often provoked relations between Muslim Egyptians and Copts. Therefore, the Egyptian government now attaches great importance to uniting the Copts, which is entirely correct.

We arrived in Aswan just as it was experiencing its coldest period. However, the gardens are still full of colorful and vibrant flowers, and lush trees, making you feel like it's March in late spring.

Aswan itself is not a large city. There is a road along the river, with a park, a sports field, several schools, and some cafes and small photography studios that also sell gifts along the roadside. There are fewer tourists this year, so business isn't very good. Behind this road is a long street, where locals trade. Along the street are shops and stalls selling various agricultural products and inexpensive daily necessities needed by farmers. It's quite lively with people coming and going. There are baskets woven from grass, with geometric patterns painted on them in ocher, dark purple, dark green, and bright red, which are very striking and beautiful.

Aswan is famous for producing a translucent red and white quartzite. This stone is called alabaster, or "marmar" by the locals. Vases, lampshades, and other utensils made from this stone, when lit from behind, allow the light to pass through the stone, revealing all the beautiful patterns. However, even more famous than alabaster is Aswan's red and black granite. The mountains near Aswan are composed of this incredibly hard granite, which has withstood the Nile's erosion for thousands of years. The ancient Egyptian temples and statues that have survived from four or five thousand years ago were almost all built and carved from Aswan granite. Ancient Egyptians used a very ingenious method to extract this hard granite. They first carved many narrow holes in the rock, filled them with dry wood, and then poured water in, using the expansion force of the wood when it became wet to split the entire large stone. Then they loaded the stones onto ships and transported them downstream. To this day, many traces of this mining method can still be seen along the Nile.

If Aswan once used its granite to leave indelible marks on the history, culture, and art of ancient Egypt, then today, it will use its granite to make even greater contributions to the Egyptian people and their descendants. On its hard granite foundation, a world-renowned high dam will be built. We, these not-so-leisurely tourists, have come to Aswan to see the site of this high dam.

Before going to the High Dam site, we first visited the existing Aswan Dam (generally referred to as the Low Dam). Seven kilometers south of Aswan by car, we saw the dam like a long dragon spanning the Nile from between the trees. Many of its gates are now closed, with torrents of snow-white water gushing out of the few that are open. Once on the dam, you immediately notice that the north and south sides are two different worlds. To the south of the dam, in the direction of the upper Nile, is a large reservoir that can hold 5 billion cubic meters of water. Now is the time of year when the reservoir is at its highest level, and the water surface is not far from the top of the dam. But to the north of the dam, in the direction of the lower Nile, thirty meters below, the shallow Nile meanders through a scattering of reefs.

This Aswan Dam was built 55 years ago (1902). It was raised twice, in 1912 and 1935. Near it, a hydroelectric power station project is underway. When the Aswan Dam was first built, there were no plans to generate electricity. Later, it was planned to reinstall power generation equipment in the dam, but doing so might affect the safety of this old dam, so it was decided to build another hydroelectric power station on the west bank upstream of the dam, 600 meters away. The 350-meter-long intake dam of this hydroelectric power station has been completed, and seven large and two small, a total of nine turbine generators will be installed. The total power generation capacity is 344,000 kilowatts, with an annual power generation of 1.76 billion kilowatt-hours. Of this, 1.35 billion kilowatt-hours will be used to produce nitrogen fertilizer, with an annual output of 370,000 tons. The other 410 million kilowatt-hours will be used for lighting, irrigation, and other purposes. The water that has passed through the turbines will be routed around the south of the dam through four tunnels excavated from the rock, and injected into the lower Nile. The total project cost is 27.5 million Egyptian pounds, contracted by a French company and a Swedish company. The project began in 1953, and will begin generating electricity in 1959, and be fully completed in 1960.

After visiting the hydroelectric power station construction site, we crossed the dam to the east bank and boarded a cruise ship towed by a small steamer, heading upstream to the site of the High Dam. The sun shone on the wide surface of the reservoir, and the waves shimmered like ten thousand golden snakes. The isolated islands in the water and the mountains on both banks are all rugged with rocks, with not a trace of greenery, looking very dry and monotonous. In fact, from here southward, there is little arable land on both banks of the Nile within Egypt, and the population is also very sparse. Only when the water level is at its lowest in August and September each year can watermelons be planted on the silt at the banks. It is said that their taste is extraordinarily sweet. Not far from the Aswan Dam was formerly the site of the first cataract on the Nile, but it has now been submerged and there is no trace of it. There is an ancient Egyptian temple of the sun god Aheesis built of stone six thousand years ago, which still exists. However, it has now been submerged by water, with only two roofs visible above the water. In the summer when the water recedes, it is fully revealed. We asked the Egyptians accompanying us why they didn't move this temple to another place to avoid damage from being submerged. They said confidently, "It won't be damaged!" This is the mystery of "eternal Egypt."

North of the temple, the peak of a rocky mountain rises out of the water. It is said that there are ancient Egyptian inscriptions carved on this mountain, indicating that this is the boundary between ancient Egypt and Nubia. To this day, the vast majority of residents south of this point are Nubians. Their skin is darker. There are some small villages on the islands in the reservoir and on the sides of the mountains on both banks, where Nubians live. According to the Egyptian guide, these villages are inhabited entirely by women and children, and the men go to Cairo, Alexandria, and other places to work as janitors in hotels. Families that have made a pilgrimage to Mecca have their houses whitewashed, while those who have not whitewashed their houses show that they still need to accumulate wealth in order to achieve the aspiration of pilgrimage.

Our ship encountered a passenger ship coming towards us, which was a liner from Aswan to Wadi Halfa in Sudan. The shape of the ship is very similar to those passenger ships on the Pearl River in Guangzhou that ply the West River route. It is 350 kilometers from Aswan to Wadi Halfa, which can be reached in two days. Only 25 kilometers of this is within Sudan.

Seven kilometers from the Aswan Dam, the Nile gradually narrows, and the rocks on both banks are jagged. This is the site of the future High Dam. On the hillside on the east bank, there are white lines painted with lime. Mikhail Mahrous, the assistant director of the High Dam project accompanying us, told us that these are the positioning lines for the water diversion tunnels of the future High Dam. On the hillside on the west bank, there is a small white house, which is the telephone exchange room for contacting the ongoing drilling and preparation work. Next to it is a small laboratory for testing the properties of the rocks, sand, and mud here. At the foot of the hillside where the telephone room is located, there is a small temporary wharf, next to which is moored a barge loaded with parts for the drilling rig. Our ship docked here.

Climbing up the hillside by the river, the site of the High Dam is all in sight. The narrow river channel here is about one and a half kilometers long, and the banks are relatively even. This dam, which Egyptians call "Saad el-Ali," will be built on this section of the riverbed. According to the design, the total length of the dam base from north to south is 1,257.5 meters. From the base, it gradually slopes upward, and the top of the dam is 32 meters wide. From the center of the dam top to both ends of the base, the southern upstream direction is longer, at 756.5 meters, and the northern downstream direction is shorter, at 501 meters. The dam is 110 meters high. The reservoir formed south of the dam can hold 130 billion cubic meters of water. The reservoir will be 500 kilometers long from inlet to outlet, of which 350 kilometers will be in Egypt and 150 kilometers will be in Sudan. The highest water level in the reservoir will be 97 meters, and the lowest will be 62 meters. The highest water level north of the dam is 27 meters. The dam will be constructed of granite fill and grout, with a reinforced concrete facing on the outside. The grout will be made from a type of Aswan mud produced here. This mud is mined from the mountains, ground into powder, mixed with water, and becomes exceptionally hard after drying, similar to a natural cement.

Underneath the mountain at the west bank where we are now standing, four huge intake tunnels will be excavated. The water rushing down from these tunnels will drive sixteen turbine generators, each with 120,000 horsepower. Their annual power generation will reach 10 billion kilowatt-hours. The electricity will be used for manufacturing fertilizers and other irrigation and industrial purposes. Underneath the mountain on the east bank, seven water diversion tunnels will be excavated to discharge the water from upstream. During the construction of the high dam, the Nile River water will flow downstream through these seven water diversion channels.

The High Dam is a comprehensive project for irrigation, flood control, and power generation. It is estimated that after the dam is built, it will increase arable land by 2 million feddans. These 2 million feddans, plus the 1.6 million feddans reclaimed in the Liberation Province, can increase the arable land for farmers who currently have little or no land. At the same time, the High Dam guarantees the country's irrigation, allowing many fields that currently grow one crop a season to be converted to two crops. It is estimated that the rice planting area can be increased from the current 250,000 feddans to 700,000 feddans, and cotton production can be increased by one-half.

The High Dam project is designed by the Standing Committee of the National Production Council, which is directly under the Cabinet. This committee was established after the revolution to be responsible for the overall development of Egypt's industry, agriculture, transportation, mining, and water conservancy. It consists of the ministers of seven departments: industry, agriculture, trade, transportation, finance, public works, and supply, as well as the director of the army's mobilization bureau and sixteen experts in various fields. Under it, there is a special department to design the construction of the High Dam. The design work has been completed. The implementation of the plan will be the responsibility of another high-level committee.

Since the Nile River flows into Egypt via Sudan, the construction of the High Dam involves Sudan. This includes issues about water allocation and the arable land that will be flooded by the reservoir. The Egyptian government has been discussing these issues with the Sudanese government. Once an agreement is reached with Sudan, the High Dam can begin construction.

The Egyptian engineers who accompanied us on the visit expressed great confidence and enthusiasm in building this dam and in the benefits it will bring to Egypt's economic development after its completion. They explained the details of the project in great detail, and their sincere and friendly feelings were truly moving. They took out their business cards and asked us to write their names in Chinese, and then treasured them as if they had found a treasure.

We returned to the ship, looked at the place where the entrances of the seven water diversion tunnels will be located in a small river upstream, and then turned back to the Aswan Dam. Behind us, the slightly turbid water of the Nile gently shimmered like silk in the afternoon sun. The hillside marked with white lines and the small white telephone room on the west bank gradually receded. Looking at the faces of the kind and determined Egyptian friends standing around us, we sincerely hope that fifteen years later, this dam, more than 100 meters high, will stand as a symbol of the courage, diligence, and wisdom of the Egyptian people, in front of us, the friends of the Egyptian people, and in front of those imperialist elements who do not take the Egyptian people seriously.

    阿斯旺和高水坝	本报记者　蒋元椿
    沿着尼罗河越是往南走，河两岸的耕地的面积就越来越显得狭窄起来。在两岸耸立着的两道连绵不绝的光秃秃的山岗，限制住了尼罗河所能灌溉的范围。有些地方，山岗直逼到了河岸上，农民们就只能在倾斜的河坡上，在河流泛滥以后留下的那一层沃土上，播种一点东西。人同自然的斗争，在这里真是何等严酷！
    在用泥砖砌成的房屋之外，这里出现了就地取材、用山上的石块砌成的房屋，它们的外形看来比较整齐。显然是为了避免浪费耕地，有许多村庄就建筑在光秃的沙山上。大概是为了避开从南面来的沙漠上的热风，许多房屋都把门开得朝向北方。有的房屋上带有一个用泥砖砌成的穹窿形的圆顶，外面抹以黄泥。更多的房子用泥砖把屋顶砌成船篷形，看来非常别致。
    这里的作物，也同尼罗河三角洲的下埃及有显著的不同。高粱看来是这里的一种重要作物，农民们用高粱秆子修筑篱垣和泥墙。地里大片地种着甘蔗，现在正在收割。人们在把甘蔗一大车一大车地送到榨糖厂里去。在村镇和城市里，常常可以看到带有十字架的基督教堂。这是埃及的少数民族科卜特人的教堂。科卜特人在上埃及的人数比较多，据说他们是古埃及人的后裔。他们的人数，有的说有一百万，有的说有三百万。他们所受的教育比较高，也比较富有。帝国主义者常常挑拨信奉伊斯兰教的埃及人同科卜特人之间的关系。所以埃及政府现在非常重视团结科卜特人的工作，这是完全正确的。
    我们来到阿斯旺，正碰上这里最冷的时候。可是，在花园里仍然是满地五色缤纷、鲜艳绚丽的花卉，和郁绿繁茂的丛树，使你有暮春三月之感。
    阿斯旺城市本身并不大。沿河一条马路，路边上有一个公园，一个运动场，几所学校，以及一些咖啡店、兼做出售礼品生意的小照相馆。今年游客少，生意都不大好。在这条马路背后，就是一条长街，是本地人做买卖的地方，沿街都是一些出售各种农产品和农民所需要的廉价日用品的铺子和摊贩。人来人往，倒也热闹。有一种用草编成的盛东西的筐子，上面有用赭黄、深紫、浓绿、大红等颜色绘成的几何形图案，非常鲜明美丽。
    阿斯旺以出产一种半透明的红色和白色的石英岩而出名。这种石头被称为阿拉巴斯特，本地人称之为马尔马尔。用这种石头做成的花瓶、灯罩之类的器具，用灯在背后一照，灯光就透过石头，把美丽的石纹全部显露了出来。然而，比阿拉巴斯特更有名的，是阿斯旺的红色和黑色的花岗石。阿斯旺附近的群山，都是这种坚硬无比的花岗石所构成，使得尼罗河的千万年的冲刷也拿它无可奈何。现在留存着的四、五千年以前古埃及的神庙和雕像，几乎全都是用阿斯旺的花岗石建筑和雕刻而成的。古埃及人用一种非常巧妙的办法来采取这种坚硬的花岗石。他们先在岩石上开凿许多狭长的小洞，在里面填上一种干燥的木头，然后把水灌进去，利用木块受潮膨胀时所发生的涨力，把整块的大石劈开。然后他们把石头装上船，运到下游去。至今，在尼罗河边还可以看到许多这种开采方法的遗迹。
    如果说，阿斯旺曾经用它的花岗石，给古埃及的历史、文化和艺术留下了不可磨灭的痕迹，那末，今天，它将用它的花岗石，为埃及人民和他们的子孙，作出更大的贡献。在它的坚硬的花岗石的基础上，一座举世闻名的高水坝将要建筑起来。我们这几个并不悠闲的游客，就是为了看一看这个高水坝的坝址而来到阿斯旺的。
    在去高水坝坝址以前，我们先去看了已经存在的阿斯旺水坝（一般相对地称为低水坝）。从阿斯旺坐车往南走七公里，就从树林之间看到了这座像一条长龙似的横跨在尼罗河上的水坝。它的许多闸门现在都关着，开着的几孔里迸泻出瀑布般的雪白的水流。一到坝上，立刻就发现坝南和坝北是两个天地。在坝南，尼罗河上游的方向，是一个大水库，可以蓄水五十亿公方。现在是一年中水库水位最高的时候，水面离坝顶没有多远。而在坝的北面，尼罗河下游的方向，在三十多公尺下面，浅浅的尼罗河，在星罗棋布的礁石群中，蜿蜒曲折而去。
    这个阿斯旺水坝，还是在五十五年以前（1902年）建成的。在1912年和1935年，曾经加高过两次。在它的附近，一项水电站工程正在进行。最初修建阿斯旺水坝的时候，并没有作发电的打算，后来计划在水坝里重新安设发电设备，但是这样做可能影响这个年代已久的坝的安全，因此决定在水坝西岸上游，离水坝六百公尺的地方，另筑一个水电站。这个水电站的一道三百五十公尺长的进水坝已经完成，将要安装七大两小，一共九部涡轮发电机。全部发电能力为三十四万四千瓩，发电量每年十七亿六千万度。其中十三亿五千万度电将用来生产氮肥，年产量三十七万吨。另外四亿一千万度电将用于照明、灌溉等方面。冲击涡轮以后的水，将由四条从山岩中开凿出来的隧洞，绕到水坝以南，注入尼罗河下游。全部工程费用为二千七百五十万埃镑，由一家法国公司和一家瑞典公司承包。工程从1953年开始进行，将在1959年开始发电，1960年全部完成。
    参观了水电站工地以后，经过水坝来到东岸，我们走上一艘由小火轮拖带的游船，向着上游高水坝的坝址驶去。太阳照在水库的广阔的水面上，波光闪烁，有如万道金蛇。水中的孤岛和两岸的山，都是乱石嶙峋，毫无一丝绿意，看来非常枯燥而且单调。事实上，由此往南，埃及境内尼罗河两岸，已经没有什么耕地，居民也非常稀少了。只有在每年8、9两月水位最低的时候，在岸边淤泥上可以种植西瓜。据说其味甘美异常。离阿斯旺水坝不远的地方，从前是尼罗河上第一个瀑布的所在地，现在已经被水淹没，没有踪影可寻了。这地方有一座六千年前用石头建成的供奉日盘神阿埃西斯的古埃及神庙，至今还是存在着。不过现在已经被水淹没，只露出两个屋顶在水面上。夏天水退的时候，它就全部显露出来。我们问同行的埃及人，为什么不把这个神庙迁移到别的地方，以免被水淹坏。他们满有把握地说：“坏不了的！”这就是“永恒的埃及”的神秘之处。
    在神庙北面，水上露出一座石山的峰巅。据说，在这山上刻有古埃及的铭文，说明这里是古埃及和努比亚的交界处。至今，由此以南的居民，绝大部分都是努比亚人。他们的肤色比较黑些。在蓄水库中的小岛上和两岸山边上，都有一些小村庄，那里住着的就都是努比亚人。据导游的埃及人告诉我们，这些村庄里住着全是妇女和小孩，男人都出去到开罗、亚历山大一带在旅馆里做勤杂工作。凡是曾经到麦加去朝圣过的人家，他们的房子外面都是经过了一番粉饰，而那些没有粉饰房子的人家，就表明他们还必须积蓄钱财，以便达到朝圣的宿愿。
    我们的船遇到了一艘迎面而来的客轮，这是由阿斯旺到苏丹境内的瓦的·哈尔法的班船。船的形状很像广州珠江上面那些走西江航线的客船。由阿斯旺到瓦的·哈尔法三百五十公里，两天可到。其中只有二十五公里在苏丹境内。
    在离阿斯旺水坝七公里的地方，尼罗河的河面渐渐狭窄，两岸岩石突兀，这就是未来的高水坝的坝址。在东岸山坡上，出现了用石灰刷成的一道一道的白线。陪我们去的高水坝工程助理主任米海依尔·马赫劳斯告诉我们说，这是未来高水坝的输水隧洞的定位线。西岸的山坡上，有一座白色的小房子，这是联络目前正在进行的钻探和准备工程的电话总机室。旁边还有一座试验这里的岩石、沙、泥的性质的小小的实验室。在电话室所在的山坡脚下，有一个小小的临时码头，旁边泊了一艘装有钻探机零件的驳船。我们的船就在这里靠岸。
    爬到临河的山坡上，高水坝的坝址就全在眼底了。这里的狭窄的河道约一公里半长，两岸比较整齐。这个埃及人称为“萨阿特·厄尔·阿里”的水坝，就建筑在这段河床上。按照设计，水坝的坝底，南北全长是一千二百五十七点五公尺。由坝底以徐缓的坡度逐渐向上，坝顶宽三十二公尺。由坝顶中心到坝底的两端，南面上游方向比较长，有七百五十六点五公尺，北面下游方向较短，长五百零一公尺。坝高一百一十公尺。坝南所形成的蓄水库可以蓄水一千三百亿公方，水库由进口到出口全长将达五百公里，其中三百五十公里在埃及境内，一百五十公里在苏丹境内。水库水位最高时可达九十七公尺，最低时六十二公尺。坝北的最高水位是二十七公尺。水坝将以花岗石填方和灌浆筑成，外面加以钢骨水泥的护面。灌浆将用这里出产的一种阿斯旺泥。这种泥由山里开采出来，磨成粉末，加水拌和，干后坚硬异常，类似一种天然的水泥。
    在我们现在所站的西岸的山底下，将要开凿出四条巨大的进水隧道。由这些隧道中下冲的水将推动十六部涡轮发电机，每部发电机有十二万匹马力。它们的全年发电量将达一百亿度。电力将用于制造肥料以及其他灌溉和工业上的用度。在东岸的山底下，将要开凿出七条输水隧道，来宣泄上游的水。在高坝建筑期间，尼罗河水将经由这七条输水道流向下游。
      高水坝是一项灌溉、蓄洪、发电的综合利用工程。据估计，水坝筑成以后，将可以增加耕地二百万费旦。这二百万费旦加上解放省开垦出来的一百六十万费旦，
  将可以增加目前无地少地的农民的耕地。
  同时，高坝保证了全国的灌溉，使许多目前种植一季作物的田地可以改为二季。据估计，大米的种植面积可以因此而由目前的二十五万费旦增加到七十万费旦，棉花可以增产二分之一。
      高水坝计划是由直属内阁的国家生产常务委员会主持设计的。这个委员会从革命以后就成立，负责统筹埃及的工农业、交通运输业、矿业、水利等各方面的发展工作。它由工业、农业、贸易、交通、财政、公共工程、供应等七个部的部长，军队的动员局局长，以及十六个各方面的专家组成。在它下面有一个专门的部门设计高水坝的建设。设计工作已经完成。计划的执行，将来将另由一个高级委员会来负责。
    由于尼罗河是经由苏丹流入埃及的。高水坝的建设，牵涉到苏丹。这里面有关于分配水量的问题以及关于被蓄水库的水淹没的耕地问题等。埃及政府一直在同苏丹政府商量解决这些问题。一等同苏丹达成协议，高水坝就可以开始动工兴建。
    陪同我们参观的埃及工程师们，对于修建这个水坝和水坝建成以后对埃及经济发展的利益，都表示具有极大的信心和热情。他们不惮其烦地向我们解释工程将要进行的详情，那种诚挚友好的感情，实在使人感动。他们拿出名片来，请我们给用中文写上他们的名字，然后如获至宝地把它收藏起来。
    我们回到船上，向上游的一条小河?里去看了看将要成为七条输水隧道进口的地方，然后掉过头来，回到阿斯旺水坝那里去。在我们背后，尼罗河的稍带混浊的水，在午后的阳光下像锦缎似地温柔地闪着光。划有白线的山坡和西岸上的那所白色的小小的电话室，渐渐向后退去。望着在我们周围站立着的善良而意志坚决的埃及朋友们的脸，我们衷心地希望，十五年之后，这道一百多公尺高的大水坝，将作为埃及人民的勇敢、勤劳和智慧的象征，站在我们这些埃及人民的朋友们的面前，也站在那些不把埃及人民看在眼里的帝国主义分子面前。（附图片）
