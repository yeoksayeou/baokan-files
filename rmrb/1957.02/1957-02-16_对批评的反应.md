	Responses to Criticism

	Removing the "Walls"
	The Yangtze River Navigation Administration wrote: After the People's Daily published the article "Remove This Kind of 'Wall'" on January 5th, we have already canceled the barbershop for cadres above the level of section chief. As for the issue of medical treatment, we are currently studying the adoption of a "zonal medical system" to resolve it.

	"Machine Tool Guard" Being Promoted
	Ningbo Iron Factory wrote: The issue of the "machine tool guard" not being promoted, as raised by the People's Daily on January 16th, is now being resolved. The reason why it was not promoted rapidly in the past was related to the insufficient attention from several relevant units in Beijing. Now, Comrade Zhu Deneng, the creator of the "machine tool guard," has arrived in Beijing and is promoting it at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.

	We Must Care About the Lives of Drilling Workers
	The Finance and Economics Committee of Qijiang County, Sichuan Province, wrote: The People's Daily published a reader's letter last year criticizing us for not caring about the lives of the local drilling workers. We have convened the relevant departments for an inspection and unanimously agreed that the criticism was correct. In response to the issues raised, we have decided to take the following measures:
	I. The Grain Bureau will immediately transfer a rice milling machine to Xinshengchang to process rice locally and supply it locally.
	II. A joint service organization composed of the supply and marketing cooperative, post office, people's bank, food company, and department store will be established within the petroleum drilling team headquarters stationed in Xinshengchang to systematically carry out service work in these areas.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    取消“围墙”
    长江航运管理局来信说：人民日报1月5日发表“解除这种‘围墙’”一文以后，我们已经把处长以上干部理发室取消了。至于治病问题，现在我们正研究采用“划区医疗制”来解决。
    “机床防护罩”已在推广
    宁波铁工厂来信说：人民日报1月16日提出的“机床防护罩”没有推广的问题，现在已在解决。过去所以没有迅速推广，与北京几个有关单位不够重视有关。现在，创造“机床防护罩”的朱德能同志已经到北京，正在北京第一机床厂推广。
    我们要关心钻探工人的生活
    四川省綦江县财政经济委员会来信：人民日报去年曾刊登了批评我们不关心当地钻探工人生活读者来信，我们已召集各有关部门进行了检查，一致认为批评是正确的，并且针对所提出的问题，决定采取以下措施：
    一、由粮食局立即调打米机到新盛场，就地加工大米，就地供应。
    二、在驻新盛场的石油钻探区队部内设立供销社、邮电局、人民银行、食品公司、百货公司的联合服务机构，有计划地作好这几方面的服务工作。
