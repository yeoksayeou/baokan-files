Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 17th: The Hungarian Foreign Ministry Press Office held a press conference in Budapest on the afternoon of February 15th. The heads of the two Hungarian refugee repatriation committees stationed in Yugoslavia and Austria spoke to reporters about the work of the two committees.

    Paliti, Chairman of the Yugoslavian Hungarian Refugee Repatriation Committee, said that his committee received assistance from the Yugoslavian side while working in the Yugoslavian Hungarian refugee camps. As a result, the work progressed relatively smoothly, enabling the committee to explain the domestic situation in Hungary and interpret the national laws to the refugees. After the explanation, many Hungarian refugees have expressed their desire to return home. Moreover, 700 people have already been repatriated. Paliti said, however, that the committee has not yet been able to reach an agreement with the Yugoslavian side on the issue of repatriating minor children. The Hungarian side believes that minor children should not be regarded as political refugees and should be repatriated in their entirety. However, the Yugoslavian side believes that repatriation should only occur upon the request of the children's parents.

    Esdelgarush, Chairman of the Austrian Hungarian Refugee Repatriation Committee, pointed out when discussing their work in Austria that the Austrian side initially created difficulties in various ways, delaying the committee's visa to enter Austria, so that when the committee arrived in Austria, most of the young Hungarian refugees had already been transported to Western countries. The Austrian side also raised unreasonable obstacles regarding the repatriation of exiled Hungarian children.

    The committee's explanatory work in the Hungarian refugee camps was subjected to organized sabotage by some reactionary elements in the refugee camps. They were scattered in every refugee camp, using intimidation or terror to threaten refugees who wanted to request to return home. Despite this, many refugees still secretly ran to the Hungarian Embassy in Austria to request repatriation.

    Esdelgarush pointed out that due to the Austrian side's uncooperative attitude on the issue of repatriating Hungarian refugees and the sabotage of reactionary elements, in addition to the 14,000 refugees stranded on the Austro-Hungarian border who managed to return home on their own, only 2,000 refugees were repatriated by the Refugee Repatriation Committee in January.

    匈外交部新闻处招待记者
    揭露奥当局阻挠匈难民回国
    新华社布达佩斯17日电　匈牙利外交部新闻处15日下午在布达佩斯举行记者招待会，由匈牙利设在南斯拉夫和奥地利的两个难民遣返委员会负责人向记者谈两个委员会的工作情况。
    南斯拉夫匈牙利难民遣返委员会主席帕利蒂说，他领导的委员会在南斯拉夫匈牙利难民营工作的时候得到了南斯拉夫方面的协助，因此工作进行得比较顺利，使委员会有可能向难民说明匈牙利国内情况和解释国家的法令。经过解释以后，有很多匈牙利难民已经表示要求回国。而且，已经有七百人遣返回国。帕利蒂说，但是，委员会同南斯拉夫方面还没有能对遣返未成年儿童的问题达成协议。因为，匈方认为，未成年的儿童不应视为政治难民而应予全部遣返。但是，南方认为，只有经过这些孩子的父母的请求才得遣送。
    奥地利匈牙利难民遣返委员会主席埃斯德尔加卢什在谈到他们在奥地利工作的情形时指出，奥地利方面一开始就多方刁难，拖延委员会进入奥境的签证，以至在委员会到达奥地利的时候已经有大部分匈牙利青年难民被运往西方国家。奥地利方面同时还在遣返流亡的匈牙利儿童的问题上提出了无理的留难。
    委员会在匈牙利难民营中的解释工作受到了难民营中一些反动分子有组织的破坏。他们分散在每一个难民营中，用恐吓或用恐怖手段威胁想请求回家的难民。尽管这样，仍有不少难民偷偷跑到匈牙利驻奥地利大使馆要求遣返。
    埃斯德尔加卢什指出，由于奥地利方面在遣返匈牙利难民的问题上采取不合作态度以及反动分子的破坏，目前，除了有一万四千名流落在奥匈边境上的难民自己设法回国以外，经难民遣返委员会遣返的难民在1月份只有两千人。
