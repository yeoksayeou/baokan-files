    The Past and Present of Rural Family Life in the Suburbs of Beijing	Li Jinghan
    (Continued from yesterday)
    A Comparison of Income, Production, and Living Standards Between the Past and Present
    The families visited this time mostly belonged to the poor, hired laborers, and middle peasant classes. Therefore, when making income comparisons, special emphasis was placed on them. In the past, the total annual family income of a family of five working as long-term laborers for landlords and rich peasants was about 320 yuan. The total annual income of poor peasant families who rented ordinary dry land for a living was slightly better than that of hired laborer families, at about 340 yuan. The total annual income of families who mainly engaged in occupations such as weaving mats, quarrying stones, selling vegetables, and driving carts was generally better than that of poor peasants, at about 370 yuan. Today, in Guajiatun Village, the average annual family income of a self-sufficient household of five, originally belonging to the poor and hired laborer classes, is about 580 yuan in 1956. The income of wealthy households, which account for one-third of the total households in the village, exceeds this figure, while the income of poor households, which account for about one-sixth of the total, is lower than this figure. Let us compare today's ordinary family income of 580 yuan with the smaller ordinary family income of 320 yuan in the past, which is an increase of over 260 yuan; if we compare it with the better income of 340 yuan in the past, it is an increase of over 240 yuan; if we compare it with the even better income of 370 yuan in the past, it is an increase of over 210 yuan.
    Now let's look at the comparison between income and living standards. The significant increase in family income today is the main factor behind the great improvement in living standards, just like rising water lifting a boat. In the past, ordinary families generally could not make ends meet. Today's ordinary families, due to their past poverty, immediately increase their consumption as soon as their income increases. This mentality of buying things and enjoying new things in a timely manner is a natural phenomenon. Nevertheless, according to my impression and the estimates of people in the village familiar with the situation of each family, except for poor households, wealthy households can generally have a surplus of over 50 yuan. Ordinary self-sufficient households with an annual income of 580 yuan may have a balance of about 30 yuan at the end of the year. Thus, let us compare the annual consumption of 550 yuan of an ordinary family today with the consumption of three types of families in the past, and we get the following results: compared with the consumption of 320 yuan of hired laborer families in the past, it is an increase of over 230 yuan; compared with the 340 yuan of poor peasants, it is an increase of over 210 yuan; compared with the higher 370 yuan, it is an increase of over 180 yuan. This shows that the improvement in living standards follows the increase in income like a shadow. The total income of these families may be higher than that of ordinary rural families in the country. This is because these rural areas have the advantage of being close to the city, and some of the people in the general family population are engaged in non-agricultural work, including industry, construction, commerce, handicrafts, schools, quarrying, and tricycle driving. The money they provide to their families accounts for about one-fourth of the total family income, and in a few cases, it reaches one-third. Since the income of families in the suburbs of Beijing is higher, and they are also influenced by urban life, their standard of living is likely to be higher than that of purely rural families.
    In 1956, Guajiatun, which mainly grows rice, had a generally good harvest year, and over 95% of the villagers increased their income compared to the previous year. Other villages suffered heavy floods and reduced production significantly, so most of the villagers' income decreased compared to the previous year. However, these families affected by natural disasters were able to maintain their achieved living standards without lowering them by actively developing sideline occupations and taking out loans. This made the families who benefited from it deeply feel that only the superiority of socialist production organizations can guarantee them a constantly peaceful life.
    The actual income of ordinary families in 1956 increased by about 40% compared to the thirty years before 1926, mainly due to the large increase in agricultural products compared to the past. For example, the average yield per mu of ordinary rice in the past was about 340 jin, while today it is about 600 jin; in the past, wheat was about 70 jin, today it is about 120 jin; in the past, cotton was about 60 jin, today it is about 120 jin; in the past, corn was about 200 jin, today it is about 330 jin; in the past, sweet potatoes were about 1,000 jin, today they are about 2,500 jin; in the past, Chinese cabbage with stalks was about 5,000 jin, today it is about 10,000 jin. Generally speaking, the total output of various agricultural products today has increased by about one time compared to the past. The main reason for such a large increase is that new production relations have replaced old production relations, enabling the adoption of many new production technologies. These farmers personally saw the superiority of organized collective production from the output: the production volume of mutual aid teams was higher than that of scattered individual farming, the production volume of the semi-socialist elementary cooperatives was higher than that of mutual aid teams, and the production volume of the fully socialist advanced cooperatives was higher than that of elementary cooperatives. What made them even happier was that their income and living enjoyment, which they were extremely concerned about, were greatly improved at the same time as the increase in production volume. This further improved their labor enthusiasm and guaranteed the increase in production volume.
    Problems Arising After Advanced Cooperativization
    Since the liberation of Beijing, through a series of movements such as land reform and cooperativization, the working people in the suburbs of Beijing have been liberated, becoming the masters of the land they cultivated, organizing themselves to develop production. Since then, they have generally lived a life of sufficient food, warm clothing, and adequate resources, which is naturally incomparable to their past lives. But if you were to ask: are they satisfied and happy today? From their simple conversations and the natural expressions in their faces, I realized that they still have some things that are not entirely satisfactory. These small dissatisfactions with the status quo are precisely the expression of a desire for improvement, not a negative attitude. Indeed, many of these opinions and feelings are justifiable, not only should they not be dismissed, but they need to be faced squarely, given sufficient attention, researched, and resolved reasonably in a timely manner. In the first family I visited, the first thing I saw upon entering was feeding pigs. The mistress of the house and those who I encountered feeding pigs in other homes generally revealed the following: it is not easy to raise pigs these days, there is not enough feed, it is difficult to buy coarse bran, soybean cakes are too expensive, the amount of grain allocated to pigs is not enough to fatten them, it is not possible to earn much money, and it is not easy to get the amount of meat you want to eat. If you don't raise them, the existing pigsty will be empty. From raising pigs, they think of raising chickens, and there are similar difficulties. Also, some things that are needed on a daily basis are often not available for timely purchase or distribution. For example, it is not easy to get hemp for sewing soles, so families cannot make enough shoes. The lack of small change also makes some people feel awkward, revealing: "When you need money, the money is not in hand," "Look how good the workers are, they get money every month, and they know exactly how much they will get, and they can spend it as they please, and they can also plan ahead. Even if you say you borrow from the cooperative, the procedures and conditions are not simple," "Even the girls here first run to the workers to find partners." There are also some things that make some people feel "unfree". For example: if you want to engage in some household sideline occupations, you may be criticized or interfered with; lack of time to handle personal matters; some surplus money is mobilized to be "voluntarily" invested; you cannot get a period of time throughout the year that you can completely control yourself; often long periods of intense labor and constant calls for rush tasks are "really overwhelming", etc. At the time, I had a potentially problematic feeling: people all know that it is wrong to treat people like cattle and horses in the past, but today, we sometimes use people as tractors.
    In addition, among the practical problems I have realized, the more significant ones are: the care for individual families, the protection of female workers, the mitigation of natural disasters, the improvement of the village appearance, the influence of old ideologies, the size of agricultural cooperatives, the adherence to democratic management and thrifty management of cooperatives, and especially the large amount of untapped potential that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.
    Conclusion
    In short, my impression is that the truth of socialism has taken root in the hearts of these villagers, and their increasingly developed labor enthusiasm and creativity are the source of the power of collective production. These new villages are carrying out various construction activities towards a more beautiful and ideal future on a stable foundation. In the future, the increase in production, the rise in income, and the improvement in living standards will naturally not be a problem. Just like the trees in spring, growing lush and verdant. All of this makes me feel infinite joy and confidence in the bright and prosperous future of these villages.
    The scope of this visit is only a small corner of the motherland, and the farmers interviewed were only over thirty, like measuring more than thirty trees in a vast forest of towering ancient trees. But this glimpse of the leopard, seeing the spots but not the whole, has already made me feel so amazed. If we glimpse the whole picture of the forest, I don't know how many more amazing miracles we will discover, and I don't know how much more "less seen and more strange" we will be.
    As this article comes to an end, I fantasize, believe, and truly feel that this largest forest in the world is growing deep roots and luxuriant foliage, with strong foundations and flourishing branches. Not only is it thriving on its own, but the whole world will also benefit more and more from it. A tree that grows out of it - I, can I not feel glorious and proud? And in this time of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, how can I not see the scenery and feel the emotions, and be overjoyed, like a dead tree meeting spring trying to open such a small flower and bear such a small fruit? Finally, I sincerely congratulate the villagers who have taught me so much this time, and wish them new achievements and a more beautiful and happy life every year as they move forward on the broad road of socialism. I dedicate this survey report as a small gift for the Spring Festival. (The End)

    北京郊区乡村家庭生活的今昔	李景汉
    （续昨）
    收入、生产同生活水平关系的今昔对比
    这次访问的家庭，多系贫、雇、中农的成分，因此在做收入的对比的时候，特别着重他们。昔日为地主、富农做长工的一个五口之家的全年家庭总收入，约为三百二十元。租种普通旱地为生的贫农家庭的全年总收入，比雇农家庭稍好一点儿，约为三百四十元。以编席、打石、卖菜、赶车等为主要职业的家庭的全年总收入又大致比贫农好些，约为三百七十元。今日在挂甲屯村原属贫雇农成分而现在变为自给户的，平均五口的家庭，在1956年的全年家庭总收入约为五百八十元左右。占村内总户数三分之一的富裕户的收入则超过此数，而约占六分之一的困难户则低于此数。就让我们以今日的普通家庭收入五百八十元同昔日普通家庭收入较少的三百二十元对比，则超过二百六十元；如果同昔日较好的收入三百四十元对比，则超过二百四十元；如果同昔日更好些的收入三百七十元对比，则超过二百一十元。
    再看收入同生活水平关系的对比。今日家庭收入的显著增加是今日生活水平大为提高的主要因素，正如水涨船高。昔日的一般人家是入不敷出。今日的普通人家由于过去家底太空，因之一有收入的增加，则所需要的消费亦立即跟着而来。这种添东西、及时享受新事物的心理是必然的现象。虽然如此，据我所得的印象和村内熟悉各家状况的人的估计，除困难户外，一般富裕户可能盈余五十元以上。年进五百八十元的普通自给户，在年底可能有三十元左右的余额。这样，让我们以今日一个普通家庭的全年五百五十元的消费同昔日三种家庭的消费对比，就得到这样的结果：同昔日雇农家庭消费三百二十元对比，则超过二百三十元；同贫农的三百四十元对比，则超过二百一十元；同较高的三百七十元对比，则超过一百八十元。这就看出生活水平的提高是如影随形的跟着收入的增加跑。这些家庭的总收入可能比国内一般的乡村家庭收入较高。这是由于这些乡村有靠近都市的有利条件，一般家庭的人口中，有些是从事非农业的工作，包括工业、建筑、商业、手工业、学校、打石、登三轮等劳动。他们供给家中的钱约占家庭总收入的四分之一左右，且有少数达三分之一者。京郊家庭的收入既然较多，再加上同时受到都市生活的影响，因之生活程度就很可能亦比较为纯粹的乡村家庭高些。
    在1956年，以种水稻为主要作物的挂甲屯的年成大致还好，村内95％以上的社员比前年增加了收入。其他几个村庄都受到很重的涝灾，减产很多，因之大多数的社员收入比前年减少了。但这些受到天灾的家庭靠积极开展副业与贷款，仍能够保持了已经达到的生活水平，并未降低。这使身受其惠的人家更深切的感觉到，唯有社会主义生产组织的优越性才能保证他们经常过着安乐的日子。
    一般家庭的实际收入在1956年比在前三十年1926年增加40％左右之多，主要是由于农产品比昔日大为增加了。例如昔日普通年成的一般稻谷每亩产量约三百四十斤，而今日约为六百斤；昔日小麦约七十斤，今日约一百二十斤；昔日棉花约六十斤，今日约一百二十斤；昔日玉米约二百斤，今日约三百三十斤；昔日白薯约一千斤，今日约二千五百斤；昔日带帮白菜约五千斤，今日约一万斤。一般说来，今日各种农产品合在一起的总产量比昔日约增加了一倍之多。增加这样多的主要原因是由于新的生产关系代替了旧的生产关系，能够采用了许多新的生产技术。这些农民从产量上亲自看到组织起来共同生产的优越性：互助组的生产量比分散的单干多，半社会主义形式的初级社的产量又比互助组多，而完全社会主义的高级社的产量又比初级社多。更使他们高兴的是在生产量增加的同时，他们极关心的收入和生活享受也大为提高了。这就更提高了他们的劳动积极性，保证了产量的增加无已。
    高级合作化以后出现的问题
    自北京解放以来，经过土地改革、合作化等一系列的运动，京郊乡村的劳动人民翻了身，作了他们所经营田地的主人，组织起来发展生产，从此一般过着大致饱食、暖衣、够用的生活，当然比昔日的生活不可同日而语了。但如果要问：他们在今日是不是满足得皆大欢喜了呢？从他们朴素的谈话和表情的自然流露里，使我理会到他们还有些不大可心的事情。这些星星点点的不满现状情绪正是要求改进的表现，并不是消极的态度。的确，其中有不少的意见和感觉是未可厚非的，不但不可一概抹煞，而且需要正视它们，加以足够的注意、研究和及时的合理解决。在我访问的第一家里，一进门首先看到的活动是喂猪。这家主妇和在别家所碰到喂猪的人大致这样的流露着：这年头儿养猪不容易，饲料不够，粗糠不好买，吃豆饼吧太贵，分配给猪的定量粮食不够养肥，赚不了多少钱，也不易得到想吃的肉量。不养吧，空着现成的圈。从养猪就想到养鸡，也有类似的困难。还有日常随时需要的一些东西，往往不能及时的买到或分到。例如，不易得到纳鞋底子用的麻，致家里做不出够用的鞋。缺零钱花也使一部分人觉着别扭，流露着：“要用钱时，钱不在手头”，“看人家工人多好，月月拿到钱，也知道准拿多少，随来随花，也能早有个打算。就说是跟社里借，手续条件什么的不简单”，“连这儿的女孩子都先跑到工人里面去找对象了。”还有一些事物使一部分人感觉着“不自由”。例如：有的要搞点儿家庭副业，就可能招出批评、干涉；缺时间办点儿私事；有的富余钱被动员“自愿”投了资；一年到头得不到能够完全由自个儿支配的一段日期；往往长时间的紧张劳动和不时号召的突击任务“真够呛的”等等。当时使我发生这样一种可能有毛病的感想：人们都知道昔日把人当牛马是不对的，而今日却有时把人当拖拉机用一用。
    此外，在我理会到的现实问题中，比较显著的还有：对个别家庭的照顾、女工的保护、天灾的减轻、村容的改观、旧思想意识的作祟、农业社的大小、民主办社和勤俭办社的坚持、尤其是尚待发挥的大量潜在力等方面，都需要早日注意。
    结语
    总而言之，我的印象是：社会主义这一真理的根已经扎入这些老乡的心里，他们日益发扬着的劳动积极性和创造性是集体生产的力量的源泉。这些新农村是在稳定的基础上，向着更美好、更理想的远景进行着种种建设活动。今后生产的增加、收入的上升、生活水平的提高，都自然是不成问题的。正如春天的树木，郁郁葱葱丛生起来。这一切的一切，使我不禁对于这些乡村前途的光明和繁荣，怀着无限的喜悦和信心。
    这次访问的范围不过是祖国里面一个小小的角落，接谈的农户又仅仅是三十多家，好像是在古木参天的广大森林里，测量了三十多棵树。但这见木不见林的窥豹一斑，已经使我感到如此惊异。如果窥视了森林的全豹，更不知要发现多少更惊异的奇迹，也不知要怎样的更“少见多怪”。
    当本文结束的时候，我幻想着、相信着也实觉着：这座世界上最广大的森林正在根深叶茂、本固枝荣地生长着。不只它自身欣欣向荣，连整个世界也将从它得到越来越多的好处。从里面生长起来的一株树——我，能不感觉光荣骄傲么？且值百花齐放、百家争鸣，又怎能不见景生情、喜不自禁，有如枯木逢春的试开那么一朵很小的花、结一个很小的果呢？最后，我衷心地祝贺这次对我赐教这样多的老乡们，在社会主义的康庄大道上迈进中，年年获得新的成就和更美好的幸福生活。谨把这篇调查记做为春节的一点儿献礼。　（完）
