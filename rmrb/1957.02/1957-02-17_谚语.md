    If you want to know about the mountains, ask the woodcutter.
    Even a rotten rope can be twisted into a rope with the strength of a thousand catties.
    Ox hooves are pointed, horse hooves are round; there's always a reason to come to your door.
    When a leech latches onto a heron's leg, it's impossible to get it off.
