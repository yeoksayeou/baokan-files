Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th. The workers of the ore group of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, who are responsible for supplying raw materials for iron smelting, have recovered more than two thousand tons of iron ore from previously discarded ore in the two months or so since the start of the increased production and thrift movement.

This year, the supply of ore raw materials for the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is insufficient. In order to ensure production, the workers of the ore group launched a movement to find tricks to save raw materials. In this movement, the workers discovered that some of the ore had been discarded or accumulated in ditches in the past because of its low iron content. After analysis and testing, the iron content of these ores averaged 32.35 percent and could be used for iron smelting. Therefore, the workers decided to recover these discarded ores.

According to the investigation by the workers in this group, at least 5,000 tons of usable ore can be recovered from the ore discarded over the years this year, to supply blast furnaces for iron smelting.

    两个月回收矿石两千多吨
    新华社太原17日电　太原钢铁厂负责供应炼铁原料的矿石组的职工，在增产节约运动开始以来的两个多月中，从过去扔掉的矿石中收回了两千多吨可以炼铁的矿石。
    今年，太原钢铁厂的矿石原料供应不足。矿石组的职工们为了保证生产，开展了一个找窍门节约原料的运动。在这个运动中，职工们发现过去有一部分矿石因为含铁量低被扔掉或积压到水沟里。这些矿石经过分析化验，含铁量平均有百分之三十二点三五，可以用来炼铁。于是，职工们就决定把这些扔掉的矿石收回来。
    根据这个小组职工的调查，今年至少能从历年扔掉的矿石中收回五千吨可用的矿石，供给高炉炼铁。
