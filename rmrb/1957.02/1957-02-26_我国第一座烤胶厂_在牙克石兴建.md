China's First Quebracho Extract Plant to be Built in Yakeshi

(By our newspaper) In the forest industry base of the Greater Khingan Mountains, Yakeshi, construction of China's first fully mechanized state-owned quebracho extract plant is underway. The plant will use the bark of Dahurian Larch, abundant in the Greater Khingan Mountains, to manufacture "tannin" through crushing and evaporation.

"Tannin" is a valuable raw material for tanning leather. Leather tanned with this raw material is not afraid of water immersion. After being soaked in water and dried, the leather can still remain soft and not deteriorate. Currently, China cannot manufacture this raw material and relies entirely on imports. After the plant is completed, it can supply thousands of metric tons of "tannin" to leather factories across the country each year.

The state-owned Yakeshi Quebracho Extract Plant was designed for China by experts from the German Democratic Republic and will be constructed using semi-mechanized methods. It is expected to be completed and put into production next year.

    我国第一座烤胶厂
    在牙克石兴建
    本报讯　在森林工业基地大兴安岭的牙克石，正着手建筑我国第一座完全机械化的国营烤胶厂。这个厂将用大兴安岭盛产的落叶松的树皮，经过粉碎，蒸发，制造成“丹宁”。
    “丹宁”是熟皮革的珍贵原料。用这种原料熟出的皮革，不怕浸水。浸水干枯后，皮革仍能保持柔软，不变质。目前我国还不能制造这种原料，完全靠进口。这个厂建成后，每年可以供应全国各地皮革厂数千公吨“丹宁”。
    国营牙克石烤胶厂是民主德国的专家为我国设计的，将采用半机械化进行施工，预计在明年竣工投入生产。
