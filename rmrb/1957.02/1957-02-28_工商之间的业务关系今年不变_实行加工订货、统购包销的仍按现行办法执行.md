Xinhua News Agency, February 27th. A responsible person from the State Council stated to Xinhua reporters today that the State Council has decided that business relations between industry and commerce will remain unchanged this year, and will continue according to the existing methods. That is, processing orders and unified purchase and sales between commercial departments and industrial departments will continue according to the existing methods. The State Council has issued a notice to this effect.

This responsible person said that after the implementation of full public-private partnership and fixed interest rates in capitalist industry and commerce, the state considered changing the original methods of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and sales by commercial departments to industrial departments, into factories purchasing raw materials and selling finished products; and allowing commercial departments to selectively purchase the original unified purchase and sales goods. This approach could promote industrial departments to better conduct economic accounting, improve product quality, and reduce costs. It could also promote commercial departments to reduce circulation links, make commodity supply appropriate, and reduce commodity circulation costs. However, after changing this relationship, a portion of the profits turned over by the wholesale institutions of the commercial departments should be transferred to the industrial departments to bear. That is to say, the portion of the profit that the commercial departments used to hand over to the state must now be collected from the industrial departments in the form of taxes and handed over to the state treasury. This profit has always been an important source of revenue in the national budget, so the state must correspondingly change the taxation methods to ensure this revenue.

This responsible person continued, because the differences between industries in our public-private joint ventures, certain state-owned industries, and cooperative industries are very large, the size of enterprises varies greatly, and there are many products. The calculation of costs and profits needs to be calculated separately. Therefore, the preparation work for transferring commercial profits to industry is extremely complex, and the formulation of new tax system also requires time. Therefore, in order to avoid possible losses to the national finances, the State Council has decided that in 1957, the original processing, ordering, unified purchase, and sales relations between commercial departments and public-private joint venture industries and cooperative industries will not be changed for the time being, and will continue to be implemented according to the original methods. At the same time, the scope of self-sales by industrial and handicraft departments will no longer be expanded in 1957.

### 工商之间的业务关系今年不变  实行加工订货、统购包销的仍按现行办法执行

    工商之间的业务关系今年不变
    实行加工订货、统购包销的仍按现行办法执行
    新华社27日讯　国务院有关负责人今天对新华社记者发表谈话，说明国务院已经确定1957年内工商之间的业务关系，仍按现行的办法不变。即现在由商业部门向工业部门实行加工订货、统购包销的，仍按现行办法执行。国务院为此并已发出了通知。
    这位负责人说，在资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营和定息以后，国家曾考虑把原来商业部门向工业部门实行加工、订货、统购、包销的办法，改变为工厂购进原料、销售成品；商业部门对原来统购、包销的部分商品实行选购的办法。这种做法可以促使工业部门更好地进行经济核算，提高产品质量，降低成本。也可以促进商业部门减少流通环节，使商品供应对路，减少商品流通费用。但是，在改变这种关系之后，商业部门批发机构的一部分上缴利润指标，应该移交给工业部门来承担，也就是说，过去商业部门交给国家的那一部分利润今后必须以税收形式从工业部门拿回来上缴国库，这笔利润历年都是国家预算中的一项重要收入，因此国家必须相应地改变税收办法，才能保证这项收入。
    这位负责人接着说，由于我国公私合营工业、某些国营工业和合作社工业中，行业之间差别很大，企业大小十分悬殊，产品繁多，成本和利润的计算需要分别计算，因之，商业利润转到工业的准备工作极为复杂，制订新的税收制度也还需要时间。因此，为了避免国家财政可能受到的损失，国务院决定在1957年内，商业部门和公私合营工业、合作社工业之间原有的加工、订货、统购、包销的关系，一律暂不变更，仍按原有办法执行。同时在1957年内，工业部门和手工业部门的自销范围也不再扩大。
