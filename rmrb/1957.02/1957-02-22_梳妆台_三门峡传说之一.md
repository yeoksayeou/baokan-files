Dressing Table
——One of the Sanmenxia Legends
Wu Yanhen

    On the left bank of Sanmenxia, ​​at the outlet of Princess River, a stone peak rises from the water, shaped like a building. Legend has it that a fairy traveled to Sanmen and once dressed on this platform, hence the name Dressing Table.
    Oh, fairy! You stepped on the clouds and flew to the platform, why didn't you lean against the window, stretch out your skillful hands, and carefully dress up? Oh, fairy! You love the waterside pavilions and the scenery on the platform, why didn't you linger for a moment, but hurriedly left to travel elsewhere? Could it be that this Yellow River, reflected in your bright mirror, makes your beautiful face appear sallow? Could it be that these waves, striking with annoying sounds, disturb your thoughts, making you too lazy to dress up? Could it be that these waves, jumping into the vermilion lacquered carved windows, wet your powder and rouge, wet your gorgeous red dress?
    Oh, fairy, you abandoned the pavilion, the pavilion is empty, the bright moon hangs on the window every night, only moonlight is seen, but you are not dressing up! Oh, fairy, the pavilion you loved has changed its scenery, please entrust the long wind to bring news, hoping you will return, come here to dress up! This clear lake water is like a bright mirror, round and bright, reflecting your face, as beautiful as a peony, blooming in the mirror! This gurgling water sound is like a harp, gently playing and singing, accompanying your thoughts, spreading your wings, flying on the water! These rippling waves are like pairs of eyes, sparkling, praising your figure, like a colorful cloud, falling on the water!

    梳妆台
    ——三门峡传说之一
    吴烟痕
    三门峡左岸，公主河的出口处，从水中耸起一座石峰，形若楼台。相传某仙女云游三门，曾在台上梳妆，故称梳妆台。
    一仙女呵仙女！你踏着云朵，飞到台上，为什么不依着窗口，伸开巧手，细心梳妆？仙女呵仙女！你爱水中楼台，台上风光，为什么不逗留片刻，匆匆而去，云游他方？莫非是这黄水，映在你明亮的镜上，把你美丽的面容，照得萎黄？莫非是这波涛，敲击着恼人的音响，扰乱了你的情思，懒得梳妆？莫非是这浪花，跳进朱漆雕花的楼窗，打湿了你的粉脂，打湿了你绚丽的红装？
    二仙女呵仙女，你弃下楼台，楼台空荡，明月夜夜挂上窗口，只见月光，不见你梳妆！仙女呵仙女，你爱的楼台，换了风光，拜托长风捎去音讯，盼你归来，来这里梳妆！这清清的湖水，像一面明镜，又圆又亮，照得你的面容，好似牡丹，在镜中开放！这潺潺的水声，像一架竖琴，轻轻弹唱，伴着你的情思，展开翅膀，在水上飞翔！这漾漾的涟漪，像双双眼睛，闪动目光，赞美你的身姿，如一朵彩霞，飘落在水上！
