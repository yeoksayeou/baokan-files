Gilded sheepskin produced in the Jincheng County area of Shanxi Province is very famous. Legend has it that people were producing it as far back as the Tang Dynasty. 1929 was the peak year for gilded sheepskin production, with the number of workers engaged in its production growing to more than two thousand. The three nationally renowned shops, Sanyi Gong, Sanyi Chang, and Tian Chang Jiu alone had more than two hundred workers, producing more than six thousand sheets of gilded sheepskin every day. After the Japanese invaders came, sales declined, workers' lives became difficult, and many changed professions to participate in agricultural production.

Gilded sheepskin is sheepskin coated with a thin layer of gold. This kind of leather is mostly used as decoration on shoes, hats, and clothing. There is a great demand for it in ethnic minority areas. The color of this leather is long-lasting and beautiful.

After liberation, the production of gilded sheepskin began to recover. In 1952, handicraft cooperatives were organized, with more than thirty people participating. In the second half of 1954, production was suspended due to the leadership's lack of attention to the production of gilded sheepskin, coupled with a shortage of raw materials. More than ten people withdrew from the cooperative; the remaining ones only did other work within the Chengguan Leather Cooperative. Production resumed in September of last year, and now the gilded sheepskin sells very well in the market. According to statistics from the past eleven months, more than 350 letters of order have been received from places such as Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Yulin, and Shanghai. The Chenghuang Temple Market Cooperative Store in Xi'an alone needs 10,000 sheets of gilded sheepskin in the first quarter of this year.

    涂上了金子的羊皮
    山西省晋城县一带生产的皮金很有名。相传远在唐代就有人生产。1929年，是皮金生产的极盛年代，从事皮金生产的工人发展到二千多人。仅三义公、三义昌、天昌久这三家全国闻名的铺子就有二百多人，每天生产皮金六千多张。日寇来侵以后，因为销路不好，工人生活发生困难，很多人都改行参加农业生产去了。
    皮金是一种涂上了薄薄一层金子的羊皮，这种皮子多数作鞋、帽、服装上的装饰品。少数民族地区需要的很多。这种皮子的色泽经久不变，而且很美观。
    解放以后皮金的生产又开始恢复。1952年组织手工业合作社，仅参加合作社的就有三十多人。1954年下半年，由于领导上没有重视皮金的生产，加上原料的缺乏而停产，退社的有十多人；剩下的也只是在城关皮毛合作社内做其他活。去年9月重新恢复了生产，现在皮金在市场上的销路很好。根据去年十一个月的统计，西安、郑州、榆林、上海等地寄来的订货的信就有三百五十多件。仅西安市城隍庙市场合作商店今年第一季度就需要一万张皮金。
