    (By our newspaper) On the morning of the 2nd, more than 1,400 long-distance runners braved the swirling snowflakes to participate in the 1957 Beijing Spring Festival Ring Road Race, sponsored by the People's Daily, Worker's Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station, among other capital news organizations.

    At the starting point in front of Tiananmen, as the referee's gun fired, more than a thousand athletes in various colored sports uniforms immediately began to run forward. Li Jinyao, a student from the Beijing Mining College, took first place amidst enthusiastic applause and cheers from the crowd, completing the 10,500-meter distance from Tiananmen, through Xidan, Pinganli, Dongsi, Dongdan, and back to Tiananmen, in 47 minutes and 10.4 seconds. The following rankings were Dong Yaolu (Beijing Mining College student), Sun Keyi (Beijing Institute of Physical Education student), Zhang Shusheng (teacher at Beijing No. 41 Middle School), Zhao Jing (worker at Factory 541), and Dai Riming (Beijing Mining College student), all of whom finished in under 48 minutes.

    The athletes participating in this mass ring road race included workers, farmers, soldiers, students, government cadres, engineers, medical workers, and others. The top 100 athletes received prizes, and all participating athletes received a commemorative medal.
