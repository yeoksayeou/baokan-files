Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 25th: The Tianjin Municipal Committee Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party held a factory propaganda work conference today. The conference decided that local Party committees should strengthen their leadership over factory propaganda work, and take strengthening political and ideological education for workers and launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy as the primary tasks of factory propaganda work this year.

The conference analyzed the current ideological situation of factory cadres and workers. It was believed that after last year's socialist transformation, the development of the advanced producers movement, the improvement of workers' lives, and the publicity on the "Eighth National Congress" and the international situation, the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been further enhanced. However, due to the large increase of new workers, the ideological consciousness of non-working class elements has also developed among the workers. Some workers lack a clear understanding of the responsibilities of the working class, do not understand the relationship between individual and collective interests, and do not understand that only by developing production can life be gradually improved. This has led to undesirable tendencies such as despising labor, simply pursuing wages and welfare, disobeying allocation, and lax discipline. Therefore, strengthening political and ideological education for workers has become the primary task of the current factory propaganda work.

The conference demanded that through political and ideological education for workers, the idea of "everything for communism" should be firmly established among communists and the working masses. It also demanded enhancing the sense of ownership and responsibility, correctly understanding the interrelationship between the individual and the collective, democracy and centralism, life and production, freedom and discipline, promoting patriotism, internationalism, and the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily and working hard, launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy, and completing this year's production tasks.

The conference pointed out that political and ideological work must be carried out regularly and systematically among the working masses. Party committees at all levels should promptly grasp the ideological trends of Party members, cadres, and the working masses, conduct regular analysis and research, establish a system of making reports to the working masses, and improve the democratic life of workers, and widely carry out mass self-education. The conference believed that improving the class consciousness and professional level of propaganda cadres and strengthening the propaganda team is the key to doing a good job in propaganda. Party committees at all levels should implement the Party's policy of doing propaganda work across the board, and overcome the erroneous tendency of "only discussing production and not discussing ideology." The Party's propaganda network should also be rectified, and new activists should be absorbed to participate.

    增强工人的主人翁自觉性和责任感
    天津加强领导工厂宣传工作
    新华社天津25日电　中共天津市委宣传部今天举行了工厂宣传工作会议。会议决定各地党委要加强对工厂宣传工作的领导，把加强对工人进行政治思想教育、开展增产节约运动，作为今年工厂宣传工作的首要任务。
    会议分析了目前工厂干部和工人的思想情况，认为经过去年的社会主义改造、开展先进生产者运动、改善工人生活以及关于“八大”和国际形势的宣传等工作以后，广大职工的政治觉悟有了进一步的提高。但是由于新工人的大量增加，工人群众中非工人阶级的思想意识也有了发展。有些工人对工人阶级的责任缺乏明确认识，不懂得个人利益和集体利益的关系，不懂得只有发展生产才能逐步改善生活的道理，产生了轻视劳动、单纯追求工资福利、不服从调配以及纪律松弛等不良倾向。因此，加强对工人进行政治思想教育，已经成为当前工厂宣传工作的首要任务。
    会议要求通过向工人进行政治思想教育，要在共产党员和工人群众中巩固地树立起一切为了共产主义的思想，增强主人翁的自觉性和责任感，正确地认识个人和集体、民主和集中、生活和生产、自由和纪律的相互关系，发扬爱国主义、国际主义和勤俭建国、艰苦奋斗的精神，开展增产节约运动，完成今年的生产任务。
    会议指出，必须有计划地经常地向工人群众进行政治思想工作。各级党委应及时地掌握党内外干部和工人群众的思想动向，定期地进行分析研究，建立向工人群众作报告的制度，并健全工人的民主生活，广泛地开展群众的自我教育。会议认为，提高宣传干部的阶级觉悟和业务水平、加强宣传队伍是作好宣传工作的关键。各级党委应贯彻执行全党作宣传工作的方针，克服“只讨论生产不讨论思想”的错误倾向。党的宣传网也要加以整顿，吸收新的积极分子参加。
