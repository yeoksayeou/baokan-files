    A Chinese Parasol Tree
    Zhe Zhong
    I was seven years old when my grandmother passed away. At that time, my family was very poor. After my grandmother died, we only used a worn-out cotton-padded jacket of "floral oil" and a pair of blue coarse cloth trousers as her burial clothes; we didn't have money to buy a coffin, so we just rolled her up in two reed mats.
    My mother was very sad, probably because she vaguely saw that she would be buried in the same way as her grandmother in the future. Every cry of my mother seemed to tear my heart apart. I burrowed into her arms, not daring to sit on her trembling, thin legs, only pressing my head tightly against her chest….
    One day, when I was herding cattle for the landlord and passing by the school, I saw many small parasol trees planted in the yard. I had heard my mother say that parasol wood was as good as pine and cypress for making coffins. At that time, I thought, if I could plant one and it grew up, even if I didn't have money to buy a coffin for my mother in the future, she wouldn't have to sleep on mats. That night, I climbed over the yard wall and pulled up a small parasol tree about a foot tall. My mother was overjoyed when she knew my intentions, and she specially fried two eggs for me to eat.
    Where to plant it? From the sky to the ground, from the houses to the fields, everything belonged to other people. My mother was so anxious that she kept sighing inside and outside the door. Finally, I said:
    "Never mind, let's plant it in front of the house. The landlord can't be that unreasonable." My mother agreed, and the little tree stood upright in front of the door.
    My mother cherished the tree very much. During festivals, she would always find a piece of red cloth to hang on the branches, as if this would ensure that the little parasol tree would grow safely; in winter, my mother would untie her foot bindings and wrap them around the trunk, fearing that it would be frostbitten; my mother almost greeted all the children in the village, asking them not to pull up the little parasol tree; even if a chick touched it, my mother's heart would ache.
    The little parasol tree quickly grew to be more than thirty feet tall and as thick as a bowl. My mother was extremely happy. In summer, people would go to the meadow to cool off, but my mother liked to sit alone on a stool leaning against the little parasol tree. When no one was around, my mother would press her face against the trunk and stroke it up and down with her hands.
    That year, on New Year's Eve, the landlord took back the land, and we were driven out of that thatched hut. Before leaving, my mother pleaded with the landlord's young master:
    "Please do a good deed, that tree was planted by my son…."
    That young man tucked his walking stick under his arm, looked at the little parasol tree, and sneered:
    "Don't you fucking dream! Not a single blade of grass here belongs to you poor devils!"
    I was furious and rushed towards him, scaring him into retreating. Suddenly, I felt a chill on my forehead. It turned out that the landlord's henchman had pointed a twenty-round box cannon at my head. My mother screamed and pulled me away.
    Having the parasol tree taken away was like having a piece of flesh cut from my heart. My mother was even more saddened. She comforted me in front of me, but cried behind my back. On dim moonlit nights, my mother would always get up and secretly go to see the little parasol tree. As soon as the little parasol tree saw my mother coming, it would wave its large leaves up and down, as if welcoming my mother and asking for her help.
    The land reform enabled us to get land and houses, and the little parasol tree came back too! My mother told everyone she met, and smiled at everyone she saw.
    After that, I joined the People's Liberation Army.
    At the end of last year, I received a letter from the township government, saying that my mother wanted to donate the parasol tree to the government to build a hydroelectric power station near our village. The government repeatedly declined, but she insisted, and now they wanted to seek my opinion.
    Before the Spring Festival, the leaders approved my return home for the festival, and I also wanted to understand the matter. My mother bought five pounds of pork and cooked rice with braised duck for me. In the evening, I asked my mother about donating the tree. She kept smiling and asked me to touch her quilt, her clothes, and the rice bin. I said:
    "Hey! Mother has become a rich peasant!"
    "You're the rich peasant!" my mother said half-jokingly. "If mother is a rich peasant, then the whole commune is a rich peasant."
    I further pressed my mother about what exactly was going on.
    "You child are truly clueless," my mother pulled me down to sit, saying, "Mother has been 'guaranteed'!"
    "'Guaranteed'?!"
    "What? Don't you believe it, or are you unwilling?" my mother asked, then muttered to herself, "Without the Communist Party, without socialism, who would care about us old bones? Son!… Look, I don't have to worry about food and clothing now, let alone…." I clearly perceived that my mother was afraid of mentioning the word "death."
    My mother then asked, "Why aren't you talking? Are you reluctant to donate it? Do you still need mother to mobilize you? Think, once the hydroelectric power station is built, there will be electricity, machines… there will be socialism…."
    I interrupted my mother, "No way, I agree one hundred and twenty percent. I was thinking, should mother be 'Five Guaranteed' or not."
    "Why?" my mother asked quickly. "Actually, I don't want to be 'guaranteed' either. The commune says I'm old and also a family member of a soldier. Look, haven't I been keeping busy!"
    "Mother! I mean, now I'm a military officer, I have the ability to support you, and I should support you."
    My mother smiled.
    The commune leader led a group of young men and women in. My mother took out the candies and pastries I brought and distributed them to everyone. When the noise subsided a little, my mother stood up and said excitedly: "I ask you, is it you who 'guarantee' me, or my son who 'guarantees' me?"
    Everyone laughed. The mischievous girl Gui Fang stretched her head out and said: "Whichever 'guarantees' you old lady is the same, it's all the Communist Party and socialism that guarantee you. Auntie, I think what you need to guarantee now isn't that parasol tree, but to have the commune leader and everyone guarantee you a daughter-in-law."
    The young men cheered loudly, the girls laughed in a huddle; my mother also grinned, my face flushed, and I hurriedly pulled down the brim of my hat…. (Attached image)

    一棵梧桐树
    哲中
    我七岁那年，祖母去世了。那时我们家里很穷，祖母死后，只用了一件“花油”破棉袄和一条土布青单裤作为她的送老衣；没有钱买棺材，两张芦席就把她卷出去了。
    娘很伤心，大概她隐约看到自己将来也会和祖母一样地安葬。娘的每一哭声像撕碎了我的心。我钻到她的怀里，不忍心坐在她的颤抖的干瘦的腿上，只把头紧贴在她的胸前……。
    一天，我给财主放牛路过学堂时，看到院子里栽了不少小梧桐树。听娘说过，梧桐树做棺材不次于松柏。当时我想，要是能栽它一棵长大了，将来就是没有钱给娘买寿材，也不会叫娘睡席子了。晚上，我翻过那院墙，拔了一棵一尺来高的小梧桐树。娘知道了我的心意可乐坏啦，她特意打了两个鸡蛋给我吃。
    栽到哪里呢？从天上到地下，从房屋到田地都是人家的，娘急得门里门外直叹气，最后还是我说：
    “管它三七二十一，就栽在屋前，财主不能那样不讲理。”娘同意了，小树就直挺挺地立在门口。
    娘可疼树啦。逢年过节总要找块红布挂在树枝头，似乎这样老天就会保佑小梧桐平安地成长；冬天，娘把自己扎脚带解下包着树干，生怕冻坏它；娘几乎招呼了村上所有的小孩，请他们不要拔走小梧桐；就是小鸡碰它一下，娘的心也会痛得发抖。
    小梧桐很快地长了三丈多高，有碗口粗。娘高兴得了不得。夏天，人们都到草地上去乘凉，娘却喜欢一个人拿个凳子靠着小梧桐坐着，没有人时，娘就把脸贴在树干上，用手上下抚摸着它。
    那年除夕，财主把地抽去了，我们被赶出那间草屋。临走时娘向财主大少爷哀求道：
    “求求您做件好事吧，那树是我儿子栽的……。”
    那小子把文明棍往胳肢窝里一夹，望着小梧桐，冷笑道：
    “别他妈的做梦啦，这里的哪一根草是你们穷鬼的？”
    我气急了，一步向他冲去，吓得他直往后退。忽然觉得脑门发凉，原来，财主的狗腿子把二十发的盒子枪对准我的头。娘吓得大叫，把我拉走了。
    梧桐树被人抢去像从我心上割去了一块肉。娘更难过，当着我的面还劝我，背着我就流泪，一到昏黄的月夜，娘总要爬起来偷偷地去看看小梧桐。小梧桐一见我娘来了，就上下摆动肥大的叶子，像欢迎我娘，又像是向我娘求救。
    土地改革使我们分得了土地和房屋，小梧桐也回来了！娘逢人便说，见人便笑。
    这以后我就参加了解放军。
    去年年底接到乡政府一封信，说我娘要把梧桐树献给政府修建我们村边的水电站，政府一再谢绝都不行，现在要征求我的意见。
    春节以前领导上批准我回家过节，我也想顺便了解一下此事。娘买了五斤猪肉，用老板鸭烧饭给我吃。晚上，我问娘献树的事，她老是笑，要我摸摸她的被、她的衣服和米柜。我说：
    “嘿！娘成富农啦！”
    “你才是富农哩！”娘半开玩笑地说，“娘要是富农，全社都是富农了。”
    我又追问娘究竟是怎么一回事。
    “你这孩子真没心眼，”娘拉我坐下，一边说，“娘被‘保’住啦！”
    “‘保’住啦？！”
    “怎么？不相信，还是不愿意？”娘问，接着又自语道：“没有共产党，没有社会主义，谁还管我们这些老骨头？儿呀！……看，我现在吃穿都不担心了，何况……。”我清楚地觉察到，娘生怕提到“死”字。
    娘又问：“你怎不说话？舍不得献它是不？是不是还要娘来动员你？你想，水电站一建成，电灯、机器……社会主义就有啦……。”
    我打断娘的话：“那里，我一百二十个同意。我在想，娘该不该‘五保’”。
    “为啥？”娘忙问道，“其实我也不愿意被‘保’呀，社里说我老了，又是军属。看，我不是也没闲着吗！”
    “娘！我是说现在我是军官了，有能力扶养你，也应该扶养你。”
    娘笑了。
    社长领了一群小伙子和姑娘们走进来，娘把我带来的糖果点心拿出来分给大家吃。等人声稍静时，娘站起来激动地说：“我问你们，到底是你们‘保’我，还是我儿子‘保’我？”
    大家哄地一笑，淘气的桂芳姑娘伸着头说：“那个‘保’您老人家还不一样，都是共产党和社会主义保您。大娘，我看您现在要保的不是那棵梧桐树，是要社长和大伙儿给您保个儿媳妇。”
    一时说得小伙子们大声叫好。姑娘们笑成一团；娘也咧着大嘴笑，我脸上一阵火烫，赶忙把帽沿往下拉了拉……（附图片）
