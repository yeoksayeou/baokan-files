　　Those Who Stay Feel Secure, Those Who Leave are Happy
　　——Introducing the Practices of Three Pilot Units in Jiangsu Province's Streamlining Efforts

　　The streamlining work of the first batch of pilot units launched by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee – the Provincial Party Committee's Organization Department, Rural Work Department, and Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture – has been preliminarily completed before the Spring Festival. A total of 370 cadres (accounting for 48.8% of the original total number of cadres) were transferred to rural areas and other lower-level units. Throughout the streamlining process, the spirit of ideological education and proper handling of cadres was implemented, truly achieving the goal of making the best use of talent, ensuring everyone finds their place, and making those who stay feel secure and those who leave happy. This has played a positive role in improving the efficiency of government offices, overcoming bureaucracy, mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres, and promoting current rural work.

　　This streamlining work has a very good ideological foundation. Cadres in government offices have generally studied the documents of the "Eighth National Congress." Through the study of the documents, cadres in these three government offices exposed and criticized the bureaucracy and subjectivism within the offices, recognized the harm of bloated organizations and overstaffing, and urgently demanded streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the lower levels to strengthen leadership over grassroots units and strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses.

　　The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee and these three departments conducted serious research before carrying out the streamlining. Everyone believed that streamlining organizations involves a wide range of issues and many problems. It is impossible to do it like in the past: "a gust of wind" during streamlining, without determining the organizational structure based on work needs, and without properly arranging the cadres, the organizations were cut, and the personnel were sent down. As a result, the cadres who went down were not at ease, and the work of the government offices was not improved. After a while, when things got too busy, the offices became bloated again. This time, we must learn from past experiences and lessons. Therefore, in the streamlining process, we first mobilized and guided everyone to summarize the work of their respective departments in 1956 and carefully discussed the future work tasks. Based on the work tasks, the organizational structure was determined; based on the workload, the staffing was determined. According to this arrangement, departments that could be merged were merged, and departments that should be abolished were abolished. These three government offices reduced twelve departments.

　　When discussing work tasks and determining staffing, the responsible comrades of these government offices personally helped each department and bureau to study and improve work methods. For example, under the guidance of the director of the Department of Agriculture, the Economic Crops Division of the Department of Agriculture clarified that the main task of the division was to provide technical guidance for four crops: cotton, hemp, mint, and spearmint, and to summarize, exchange, and promote advanced experiences. In terms of work methods, a combination of points, surfaces, and inspections was adopted. In this way, the division made specific divisions of labor, clarified responsibilities, and improved its work. Not only can the staffing be reduced from the original 26 to 14, but also work efficiency can be improved to ensure the completion of the work.

　　The handling of personnel retention and departure during streamlining is a very complicated task. During the discussion of the preliminary plan at the department affairs meetings and the bureau director meetings, it was found that some people wanted to "retain the strong and remove the weak" and desperately fought for cadres; while another group of people wanted to "rush headlong" to send cadres down. Based on these situations and the experience and lessons of past streamlining efforts, the Provincial Party Committee proposed that personnel placement must be uniformly arranged and rationally adjusted. Before proper placement, blind decentralization should not be carried out, and the spirit of seeking truth from facts should be implemented. In the unified arrangement, the principles of internal and external consideration, strong and weak combination, and strengthening the lower levels were implemented. On the one hand, all cadres were asked to express their opinions on personal retention and departure in the small group meetings for discussing the plan, so that the leadership could consider and take care of everyone's expertise and wishes when assigning cadres. On the other hand, comrades were required to obey the needs of the work and obey the organization's arrangements.

　　Where do people go? Judging from the situation of the three pilot units in Jiangsu Province, as long as the principle of strengthening the lower levels is carefully followed, there are many ways out, and the vast majority of cadres can be assigned to suitable places. In particular, the vast rural areas have continuously promoted cadres upwards in recent years, so the grassroots leadership is relatively weak and needs a large number of cadres to strengthen it. Last year, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the work focus of changing the poverty of Xuzhou and Huaiyin areas, and prepared to change this area into a new rice-producing area and cotton-producing area in three to five years. This area needs to vigorously strengthen grassroots leadership and also needs a large number of technical cadres who understand cotton and rice production. This time, due to the improved awareness of the cadres of the Department of Agriculture, many people asked to go to the Xuhuai area to do pioneering work. After careful arrangement of the work by various divisions and offices, the entire department can draw 80 cadres to work in the Xuhuai area, including 50 technical cadres and 8 professional engineers. Although the cadres transferred from the Rural Work Department and the Organization Department do not have specialized skills, most of them come from rural areas, have rural work experience, and are familiar with the rural situation. Therefore, they are also relatively easy to arrange, and wherever they are assigned, the county and district committees and farmers welcome them.

　　However, if some cadres with low political and cultural levels and poor work experience are assigned to lower levels, they will not be of much use. The leadership decided that this group of cadres will not be transferred for the time being. Because these cadres are mostly young and have potential for development, they are prepared to be recommended to agricultural specialized schools for long-term training. This part of the cadres is also very satisfied with this arrangement.

　　In this streamlining, these departments also strengthened the departments that should be strengthened in a realistic manner according to work needs. For example, the Rural Work Department strengthened its office, increasing the number of personnel from 16 to 19, so that it can use its main strength to conduct special investigations and research and accumulate rural economic data for a long time. The original Grain Crop Division of the Department of Agriculture had 25 cadres, but Jiangsu has a large task of grain and oil production, and it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance for production and changing farming systems. Therefore, the new Grain and Oil Crop Division itself has only 22 people, 3 fewer than the original, but in addition, a 20-member agricultural reform work team was set up under the leadership of this division to strengthen guidance in the rice reform areas.

　　Now, the vast majority of the cadres that these three government offices have decided to transfer have arrived at new work posts in rural areas in Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Songjiang, Nantong and other prefectures. The comrades who remain in the government offices are studying and improving work methods to improve work efficiency, planning to undertake the work of two people in the past, and ensuring that the quality of work is higher than in the past.

    留者安心　去者愉快
    ——介绍江苏省整编工作三个先行单位的做法
  　史越峨
    中共江苏省委开展整编工作的第一批先行单位——省委组织部、农村工作部和江苏省农业厅的整编工作，已经在春节前初步完成。共抽调三百七十名干部（占原有干部总数48.8％），充实到农村等下层单位。在整编中，自始至终贯彻了思想教育和妥善处理干部的精神，真正做到了人尽其才，各得其所，留者安心，去者愉快。这对提高机关工作效率，克服官僚主义和调动干部积极性，推动当前农村工作，都起了良好的作用。
    这次整编工作，有一个很好的思想基础。机关干部普遍学习了“八大”的文件。通过文件的学习，这三个机关的干部揭发和批判了机关内部的官僚主义和主观主义，认识到机构臃肿、人浮于事的害处，迫切要求精简上层充实下层，加强对基层单位的领导，密切党与人民群众的联系。
    省委和这三个部门的负责同志，在进行整编之前，进行了认真的研究。大家认为精简机构牵涉的范围广、问题多，不能再像过去一样：整编时“一阵风”，不根据工作需要来确定组织机构，干部也没有很好地安排就把机构削减了，人员下放了。结果，下去的干部不安心，机关的工作没有改进。过了一个时候，实在忙不过来，机关又庞大起来了。这次一定要接受过去的经验教训。因此，在整编中先发动和引导大家总结本部门1956年的工作，仔细地讨论了今后的工作任务。根据工作任务，确定机构设置；根据工作量，确定人员编制。根据这样的安排，可以合并的部门就合并了，应该取消的就取消了，这三个机关就减少了十二个部门。
    在讨论工作任务确定编制时，这些机关的负责同志都亲自帮助各处、室研究改进工作方法。如农业厅经济作物处在厅长帮助下，明确了该处的工作主要是对棉花、麻、薄荷、留兰香四种作物进行技术指导，总结、交流和推广先进经验。在工作方法上采取点、面和巡视检查相结合的方法。这样，这个处作了具体分工，划清了职责，改进了工作。不仅可以把编制从原来二十六人缩减到十四人，而且可以提高工作效率，保证做好工作。
    整编中人员去留的处理是一件很复杂的工作。在部务会议，处、局长会议讨论初步方案的时候，发现有人想“去弱留强”，拼命争干部；而另一部分人就想“一窝蜂”地把干部往下放。根据这些情况和以往整编的经验教训，省委提出：对人员安置必须统一安排、合理调整，在没有妥善安置以前，不要盲目地下放，贯彻实事求是的精神。在统一安排时，贯彻了内外照顾，强弱搭配，充实下层的原则。一方面由全体干部在讨论方案的小组会上提出志愿，表示个人去留的意见，使领导上分配干部时考虑照顾各人的专长和志愿。另一方面，要求同志们必须服从工作的需要，服从组织的分配。
    人往那里去？从江苏省三个先行单位的情况看来，只要根据充实下层的原则认真处理，出路是很多的，绝大部分干部可以分配到合适的地方去。特别是广大的农村，几年来不断向上提拔干部，因而基层领导比较薄弱，需要大批干部去加强。去年，省委提出了改变徐州、淮阴地区的贫困面貌的工作重点，准备把这个地区在三、五年内改变为新的水稻产区和棉花产区，那里需要大力加强基层领导，也需要大批懂得棉花、水稻生产的技术干部。这次农业厅的干部由于提高了觉悟程度，很多人要求到徐淮地区去做开辟工作。各处、室对工作作了细致的安排之后，全厅可以抽出八十个干部去徐淮地区工作，其中有技术干部五十名，而且有专业工程师八名。农村工作部和组织部抽调出来的干部虽然没有专门技术，可是他们绝大部分是来自农村的，有农村工作经验，对农村情况熟悉。因此，他们也比较容易安排，分到那里，那里的县、区委和农民都是欢迎的。
    但是，也有一些政治水平和文化水平较低，工作经验较差的干部如果分配下去，作用不大。领导上决定这批干部暂时不下放。由于这些干部大都很年青、有培养前途，所以准备保送他们去农业专门学校长期培养。对于这样的处理，这部分干部也很满意。
    在这次整编中，这几个部门也根据工作需要，实事求是地加强了应该加强的部门。如农村工作部加强了办公室，人员从十六人增加到十九人。使它能够以主要的力量进行专题调查研究和长期积累农村经济资料。农业厅的粮食作物处原来是二十五个干部，但江苏的粮食、油料生产任务很大，必须加强生产和改变耕作制度工作的技术指导，因此新的粮食油料作物处本身虽然只有二十二人，比原来少了三人，而另外又在这个处领导下增设了一个二十人的农业改制工作队，以加强水稻改制地区的指导。
    现在，这三个机关决定下放的干部绝大多数都已经到达徐州、淮阴、松江、南通等专区农村新的工作岗位，留在机关工作的同志都在研究改进工作方法，提高工作效率，打算一个人承担过去二个人的工作，而且保证工作质量比过去更高。
