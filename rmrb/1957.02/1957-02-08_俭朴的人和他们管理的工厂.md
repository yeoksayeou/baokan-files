Frugal People and the Factories They Manage	Sun Wei

The Shaanxi No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, located near Caijiapo Town, Qishan County, a relatively remote small town along the Longhai Railway, has been in operation for fifteen or sixteen years. Its total production equipment, including the part expanded after liberation, consists of only 30,000 spindles, making it the smallest unit under the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau. The factory's machinery is very old. Except for the more than 10,000 domestically produced spindles added after liberation, the rest are old machines with many years of history, most of which have been repeatedly repaired and improved. Thanks to the care and meticulous management of the factory's workers, these old machines are not obsolete and continue to play their role in building socialism. In recent years, the factory's production costs have decreased year by year. From the early days of liberation to the end of 1956, the funds accumulated by the factory for the state are more than enough to build a new factory of the same scale.

After liberation, with the expansion of the factory's production scale, the number of employees doubled. Many employees who originally did not bring their families have also brought their families. In order to avoid increasing the state's expenses, the factory's Party organization and administrative leaders personally took the lead in giving up part of their housing. Under their leadership, many employees voluntarily made friendly concessions, giving up dozens of rooms throughout the factory. This not only solved the urgent housing difficulties of some employees, but also avoided the factory's surplus expenditure. In recent years, in addition to building a new factory building to meet the needs of production after expansion, the factory has only built sixty-odd non-production rooms. They always adhere to the principle of not building unless it is necessary, making full use of some of the original dilapidated houses. Now, the factory's newly added employee family dormitories, kindergartens, clubs, auditoriums, and raw material warehouses are all temporary factory buildings and warehouses built during the War of Resistance Against Japan, which were repaired and renovated with very little money. Even the offices of the factory's Party organization, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union are located in the original dilapidated cotton-picking room.

The original machinery and equipment of the Shaanxi No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory was not only old, but also backward in design. Compared with the equipment of the newly built cotton textile factories, there is a world of difference. In the early days of liberation, the reeling machines here were manually operated. Although they have been improved now, they are still far from comparable to the new reeling machines. The two generators currently running in the power plant, one is an American product from thirty-seven years ago, and the other is made in Japan thirty-one years ago. A comrade familiar with the factory's history said that these two generators had exceeded their designed service life when they were purchased. Before liberation, power outages occurred almost every day. After liberation, the employees believed that this was state property and should think of more ways to make it play a better role. The old technicians treated it like an old friend, repairing and inspecting it diligently, so that it continued to play its role, and basically eliminated power outages. In 1956, the coal consumption of the power generation department was 290 tons less than in 1955.

In this factory, there are frugal housekeepers. They are always conscientiously managing their own "housekeeping." Zhan Yonghe, the secretary of the factory's Party committee, and Li Dechun, the factory director, are good at budgeting and living frugally. The offices of Party Committee Secretary Zhan Yonghe and Deputy Secretary Feng Changchun are located in an old cotton-picking room. The two of them sit opposite each other at a small desk with peeling paint. Outside the office of the Party committee secretary, there is a conference room and secretary's office with two small rooms. The conference table is also made up of four old dining tables of different colors, and there is not even a tablecloth. However, they did not dislike the simplicity. Zhan Yonghe said: "I went up the mountain to chop firewood and sell it to make a living when I was ten years old, and I joined the revolution at the age of thirteen. When crossing the grassland, it was raining above and there were one or two inches of water and mud below at night, but I still slept soundly. I remember that in 1948, when we spent the New Year in Hengshan County, northern Shaanxi, we only received three potatoes and a bowl of elm bark soup every day. Compared with the past, there are no difficulties now." Zhan Yonghe not only demanded strictness from himself, but also often used the stories of the Long March and the great production campaign in the liberated areas to educate employees to develop a hard-working and simple style.

Factory director Li Dechun, who came from a fitter background, developed a habit of diligence and thrift from an early age. In 1944 and 1948, when he was building factories in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, he was elected as a creation hero and a labor hero for his contributions to creation and conservation. After coming to this factory, he often said to cadres and workers: We have our own small families, and the factory is our big family. Many people can manage their own small families diligently and thriftily, and this spirit should also be used to manage our factory. At the factory's financial settlement meeting, he often helped with the work himself. He would not easily let go of even the smallest unreasonable expenditures. Once, he found a few leather rollers in the scrap pile of the scrap room that should not have been scrapped. He immediately seized on this point and explained the relationship between waste of materials and costs to the workers. As a result, the workers automatically checked the waste again and picked out the usable leather rollers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    俭朴的人和他们管理的工厂	孙维
    开设在陇海铁路旁一个较偏僻的小市镇岐山县蔡家坡镇附近的陕西第二棉纺织厂，建厂已经有十五、六年的历史了。这个厂全部生产设备，连同解放以后扩建的一部分设备在内，总共只有三万枚纱锭，是西北纺织管理局所属单位中规模最小的一个。工厂的机器设备都很陈旧，除解放以后新增添的一万多枚国产纱锭以外，其余都是具有多年历史，而且大部都是经过一再修补改进的旧机器。由于这个工厂的职工们的爱护和细心经管，这些陈旧的机器老而不废，在建设社会主义的道路上，继续发挥着它的作用。几年来，这个厂的生产成本逐年下降，从解放初期到1956年底，这个厂给国家积累的资金可以新建和它同样规模的一个工厂还要多。
    解放以后，这个厂随着生产规模的扩大，职工人数比原来增加了一倍。原来许多没有带家眷的职工，也都把家属接来了。这个工厂的党组织和行政方面的领导干部为了不增加国家的开支，亲自带头把自己的住房让出一部分来。在他们的带动下，许多职工自动地实行了友爱的腾让，全厂共让出了几十间房子。这样既解决了一部分职工急需住房的困难，又避免了工厂的多余开支。几年来，厂里除为适应扩建以后生产方面的需要，盖了一座新厂房以外，非生产用房总共只修建了六十几间。他们总是本着能不建就不建的原则，充分利用原来的一些破旧房屋。现在厂里新增加的职工家属宿舍、幼儿园、俱乐部、大礼堂以及原材料仓库等，全都是在抗日战争时期修建起来的临时厂房和仓库，只花很少的钱加以修补改建的。就连工厂党组织、青年团、工会的办公室，也是设在原来一幢破旧的拣花房里。
    陕西第二棉纺织厂原有的机器设备不但陈旧，而且设计上也很落后，如果以它同现在的新建的棉纺织厂的设备来比，真有天壤之别。解放初期，这里的摇纱机还是人力摇动的，现在虽然已经改进了，但还是远远不能同新式摇纱机比较。发电所里现在正在转动的两部发电机，一部是三十七年前美国的产品，一部是三十一年前日本制造的。一位熟悉工厂历史的同志说，这两部发电机在购买它们的时候，就已经超过了设计使用年限。解放以前，几乎每天都会发生停电事故。解放以后，职工们认为这是国家的财产，应多想些办法使它更好地发挥作用。老技术工人们像对待老朋友一样，对它勤修理，勤检查，使它继续发挥作用，并且基本上消灭了停电事故。1956年，发电部门的煤耗还比1955年少用了二百九十吨。
    在这个工厂里，有着俭朴的持家人。他们时刻都在兢兢业业地主持着自己的“家务”。工厂中共党委书记詹永和、厂长李德纯，就是善于精打细算过日子的人。党委书记詹永和、副书记冯常春的办公室，就是设在一所旧拣花房里。他俩对坐在一张已经脱了漆的小写字台两面办公。党委书记办公室外面有一个两小间房的会议室和秘书办公室，会议桌子也是用四张颜色不同的旧饭桌凑起来的，而且连桌布也没有。但是，他们并没有嫌简陋。詹永和说：“我十岁就上山打柴卖维持生活，十三岁参加革命。在过草地的时候，晚上上边雨淋着，下边有一、两寸深的水和泥，觉还是睡得香。记得1948年在陕北横山县过新年的时候，我们每天才分到了三个洋芋和一碗榆树皮汤。现在的情况和过去一比，啥困难也不存在了。”詹永和不但要求自己严格，还常用长征和解放区大生产时期的故事教育职工，要大家养成艰苦朴素的作风。
    钳工出身的厂长李德纯，从小就养成了克勤克俭的习惯。1944年和1948年他在晋绥解放区筹建工厂的时候，就因为创造、节约有功，先后当选了创造英雄和劳动英雄。来到这个工厂以后，他常对干部和工人说：我们自己有小家庭，工厂是我们的大家庭。许多人都能克勤克俭地把自己的小家庭管理好，这种精神也应该用到管理我们的工厂中来。在工厂财务决算会议上，他常常亲自帮助工作，那怕是细小的不合理开支，他也不肯轻易放松。有一次他在废料房的废料堆里，发现有几个不应该报废的皮辊，他马上抓住这一点，向工人们解释了浪费材料和成本的关系。于是，工人们便自动地把废料又检查了一遍，把可以使用的皮辊都拣了出来。　（新华社）
