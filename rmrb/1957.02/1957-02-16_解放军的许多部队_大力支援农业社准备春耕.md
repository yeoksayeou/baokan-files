Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are vigorously supporting local agricultural production cooperatives in preparing for spring plowing to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

　　In the fields of southern China, where spring is already in the air, PLA officers and soldiers are working alongside farmers to build water conservancy projects. Officers and soldiers of a certain PLA unit stationed in Huaxian County, Guangdong Province, went to Qishan Great Embankment to help the agricultural cooperative build a large dam, repairing more than 16,900 cubic meters of earthwork in five days. After the dam is built, it can prevent more than 4,600 mu of rice fields from being flooded, and the plan to increase rice production by 300,000 jin in Huaxian County this year will also be guaranteed. According to the newly revised plan to support agricultural production, the PLA unit stationed in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, helped a township build a dam that can irrigate 4,500 mu of rice fields. Last year, southern Hunan Province suffered from drought, and the rice production of Qunjian Agricultural Cooperative decreased. The members were eager to build a reservoir this year. Recently, a certain PLA unit stationed in the local area dispatched more than 6,000 laborers to help the members realize this wish. This reservoir can irrigate 800 mu of rice fields and resist drought for two months. Officers and soldiers of the PLA units stationed in Chaoan County and Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, also participated in the voluntary labor of the Baisha Ridge Reservoir and the Xinxi River Reservoir respectively.

　　In the frozen north, when spring arrives, the thawing of rivers often causes ice jams downstream, leading to floods. The leading organs of the PLA stationed in the Jinan area have dispatched heavy mortar teams to be assigned to the Yellow River Ice Prevention Headquarters in order to use artillery fire to break the ice floes in a timely manner, and are also prepared to dispatch aircraft to bomb the ice jam sections when necessary to dredge the river.

　　Under the slogan of striving for a bumper harvest this year, officers and soldiers of various units have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and helped agricultural cooperatives prepare for spring plowing in various ways. Officers and soldiers of a certain PLA unit stationed in the suburbs of Nanjing braved the biting wind and snow, broke the ice and went into the water, and in three days dug through a stinky ditch that breeds schistosomiasis in Chunhua Town, and turned it into a canal that is 258 meters long, 6.5 meters wide, and 1.5 meters deep. A certain PLA unit stationed in the Luzhou area of Sichuan Province proposed that each person should accumulate 150 jin of fertilizer for the agricultural cooperative. Officers and soldiers used their spare time to dig sludge in the gutters. In one month, they have accumulated more than 63,000 jin of fertilizer, of which one class accumulated 13,000 jin. In the past two months, the PLA garrison in Wuhan has allocated 71 trucks to assist the government in transporting 33,000 tons of grain to the disaster area to support the people in the disaster area in spring plowing production. The General Logistics Department of the PLA sent nine veterinary officers to the Sino-Korean Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, to carry out anthrax spore vaccine and tetanus toxoid preventive injections for more than 530 livestock in the cooperative. Many troops have also signed support contracts with agricultural cooperatives.

    解放军的许多部队
    大力支援农业社准备春耕
    新华社15日讯　中国人民解放军的许多部队，正在大力支援驻地农业生产合作社准备春耕生产，争取今年大丰收。
    在春色已浓的祖国南方田野上，解放军官兵正在同农民们一起在为兴修水利忙碌。广东花县驻军某部官兵，到岐山大圩帮助农业社修筑一道大堤，五天中培修了一万六千九百多土方。这道堤筑成以后，可以使四千六百多亩稻田不再受涝，今年花县增产三十万斤稻谷的计划也有了保证。广东惠阳县驻军根据新订的支援农业生产计划，帮助一个乡修了一个可以灌溉四千五百亩稻田的水坝。去年湖南省南部天旱，群建农业社水稻减产，社员们渴望今年修建一个水库。最近当地驻军某部抽出六千多个劳动力帮助社员们实现了这个愿望。这个水库可以灌溉稻田八百亩，抗旱两个月。广东潮安县、揭阳县的驻军官兵，也都分别参加了白沙岭水库、新溪河水库的义务劳动。
    在万里冰封的北方，春天河流解冻，流冰往往阻塞下游酿成水灾。驻济南地区解放军领导机关已经派出重迫击炮队配属黄河防凌指挥部，以便及时地用炮火破除冰凌，还准备在必要时派出飞机轰炸卡冰地段，以疏导河流。
    各部队的官兵们在争取今年大丰收的口号下，发扬了高度的劳动热情，从各方面帮助农业社准备春耕。南京市郊区驻军某部官兵冒着刺骨的风雪，破冰下水，在三天中挖通了淳化镇的一条繁殖血吸虫的臭水沟，把它修成长二百五十八公尺、宽六点五公尺、深一点五公尺的水渠。驻四川沪州地区某部提出每人给农业社积肥一百五十斤，官兵们利用空闲时间到阴沟里去挖污泥，一个月来已经积肥六万三千多斤，其中有一个班就积肥一万三千斤。武汉驻军两个月来调拨汽车七十一辆，协助政府把三万三千吨粮食运到灾区，支援灾区人民春耕生产。解放军总后勤部派出九个兽医军官前往北京市丰台区中朝友谊农业社，为全社五百三十多头牲口进行了炭疽芽胞苗和破伤风类毒素预防注射。许多部队还同农业社订立了支援合同。
