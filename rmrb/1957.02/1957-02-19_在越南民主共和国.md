	In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
	Enthusiastic Development of Savings Movement

	Hanoi - Cadres and staff in agencies, organizations, enterprises, schools, and military units in Hanoi have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the government and launched a savings movement at the beginning of this year. In January 1957 alone, savings deposits of staff in central and Hanoi municipal agencies reached over 340 million Vietnamese Dong. It is estimated that if this amount is loaned to farmers, they can purchase 1,800 head of cattle or 24,000 sets of plows and harrows.

	The upsurge of savings during the Spring Festival in Hanoi has now rapidly received enthusiastic responses from cities and regions throughout Vietnam.

	1,700 Kilometers of Telephone Lines Erected Last Year

	In order to build a telephone network centered on Hanoi and extending to various provinces and regions, in 1956, in addition to completing the originally planned 1,480 kilometers of telephone lines, an additional 150 kilometers of lines beyond the plan were also completed.

	The Hanoi-Vinh Linh and Hanoi-Friendship Pass lines have also been completed, enabling Hanoi to directly communicate with Beijing and other fraternal countries.

	Various Regions Summarize Achievements in Literacy Work Over the Past Year

	Currently, various regions in Vietnam are summarizing the achievements in literacy work over the past year.

	Lien Son Village in Ninh Binh Province, one of the earliest villages in North Vietnam to eliminate illiteracy, was awarded the Third-Class Labor Medal by the government and received a letter from President Ho Chi Minh to the village.

	In addition, the literacy work in construction sites and enterprises in Lao Cai Province completed 392% of the original plan, Thanh Hoa Province completed 102.1% of the original plan, and Nam Dinh Province also completed the 1956 literacy plan.

	In the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region, literacy work has greatly developed over the past year. Currently, there are 1,193 civilian literacy classes in the 17 states of the autonomous region, with a total of 32,714 people participating in the learning, an increase of 17,573 people compared to 1955.

	Since the spring semester of 1956, a learning upsurge has emerged in the autonomous region. To date, nearly 20,000 people in the entire autonomous region have escaped illiteracy.

    在越南民主共和国
    节约储蓄运动热烈展开
    河内各机关、团体、企业、学校和部队中的干部及工作人员热烈响应党和政府的号召，在今年年初开始，展开了一个节约储蓄运动。仅在1957年1月，中央及河内市各机关的工作人员节约储蓄存款已达越币三亿四千余万元。据估计，如以这一笔款贷给农民，则农民可以购买一千八百头耕牛或二万四千套犁耙。
    河内市春节期间出现的节约储蓄热潮，现在已经迅速地获得越南各城市和各地区的热烈响应。
    去年架设一千七百公里电话线
    为了建设以河内为中心，伸向各省、区的电话网，在1956年内，除完成了原计划架设的一千四百八十公里电话线外，尚超额完成了计划以外的一百五十公里线路的架设工程。
    河内——永灵、河内——睦南关线路也已架设完毕，这使河内能与北京以及其他各兄弟国家直接通话。
    各地总结一年来扫盲工作的成就
    目前，越南各地正在总结一年来扫盲工作的成就。
    北越地区最早扫除文盲的乡村之一——宁平省莲山村获得政府颁发的三等劳动勋章，并收到了胡志明主席写给该村的信。
    此外，在老街省各工地、企业中，扫盲工作完成了原计划的392％，清化省完成了原计划的102.1％，南定省也完成了1956年的扫盲计划。
    在傣苗自治区，一年来扫盲工作有很大发展。现在，在自治区的十七个州中就有一千一百九十三个平民识字班，共有三万二千七百一十四人参加学习，学习人数比1955年增加了一万七千五百七十三人。
    自1956年春季开学以来，自治区就出现了学习热潮，至今全自治区已有将近二万人脱离了文盲状态。　（罗）
