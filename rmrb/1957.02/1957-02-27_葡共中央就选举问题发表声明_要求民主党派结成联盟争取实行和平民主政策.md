Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party issued a statement on the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in Portugal. The statement pointed out that Portugal's political system represents the interests of a minority in the country – the big financial capitalists and monopoly capitalists. The living conditions of the working class and all the Portuguese people are very difficult. Democratic freedoms in Portugal are being stifled. Dissatisfaction with the Salazar government is growing within the country.

The statement then pointed out that the Salazar government is attempting to gain the support of international reactionary forces and imperialist blocs, primarily the United States. The war policy pursued by this government has caused severe damage to the domestic economy and brought serious threats to the peaceful lives of the Portuguese people. Portugal should pursue a policy of neutrality, peace, and coexistence.

The Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party called on all democratic parties and groups to form a broad electoral alliance based on the following minimum program: raise the people's living standards; defend the national economy and oppose the government's pro-monopoly capital policies; restore democratic freedoms; grant amnesty to political prisoners; implement an independent foreign policy and establish normal economic and diplomatic relations with all countries in the world.

    葡共中央就选举问题发表声明
    要求民主党派结成联盟争取实行和平民主政策
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社消息：葡萄牙共产党中央委员会就葡萄牙即将举行的议会和总统选举发表声明。声明指出，葡萄牙的政治制度代表国内少数人——大金融资本家和垄断资本家的利益。工人阶级和葡萄牙全体人民的生活条件非常困难。葡萄牙的民主自由被扼杀。国内对萨拉查政府的不满日益增长。
    声明接着指出，萨拉查政府企图得到国际反动势力和帝国主义集团的支持，首先是美国的支持。这个政府所执行的战争政策使国内的经济遭受了严重的损失，给葡萄牙人民的和平生活带来了严重的威胁。葡萄牙应当奉行中立、和平和共处的政策。
    葡萄牙共产党中央委员会呼吁各民主党派和团体以下列最低纲领为基础结成广泛的选举联盟：提高人民生活水平；保卫国家的经济和反对政府的亲垄断资本的政策；恢复民主自由；大赦政治犯；实行独立的对外政策和同世界上所有的国家建立正常的经济和外交关系。
