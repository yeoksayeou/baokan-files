Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 16th. The Sugar Beet Sugar Production Industrial Research Office, the Sugar Beet Experimental Station, and the Sugar Production Industrial Design Company established by the Ministry of Food Industry in Heilongjiang Province have all begun their work.
    The Sugar Production Industrial Research Office mainly studies how to reduce sugar loss and increase the sugar extraction rate from sugar beets during sugar production operations. They have already made a special research plan for reducing sugar loss in sugar production this year. The task of the Sugar Beet Experimental Station is to experiment with and research scientific sugar beet cultivation techniques, improve sugar beet sugar content, and cultivate new sugar beet varieties. This experimental station is holding a training class for seventy sugar beet technicians from Inner Mongolia, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, and has hired Polish experts to teach technical knowledge in sugar beet cultivation and other aspects. The Sugar Production Industrial Design Company, which was expanded from a design office of the Heilongjiang Provincial Sugar Production Industry Bureau, will complete the design work for new sugar beet sugar factories in Hohhot, Xinjiang, and other places this year. In the future, this company will carry out factory design work for new and expanded sugar beet sugar factories across the country.

    提高甜菜出糖率
    甜菜制糖研究机构成立
    新华社哈尔滨16日电　食品工业部在黑龙江省建立的甜菜制糖工业研究室，甜菜试验站和制糖工业设计公司，已经先后开始工作。
    制糖工业研究室主要研究制糖操作中如何降低糖分损失，提高甜菜出糖率。他们已经作出今年在糖业生产中降低糖分损失的专题研究计划。甜菜试验站的任务是试验研究甜菜科学栽培技术、提高甜菜含糖量和培育甜菜新品种等。这个试验站正在举办一个来自内蒙古、吉林和黑龙江省等地的七十名甜菜技术人员的训练班，并且聘请波兰专家讲授甜菜栽培等方面的技术知识。由黑龙江省制糖工业局的一个设计室扩充起来的制糖工业设计公司，今年将完成呼和浩特、新疆等地新建甜菜制糖厂的设计工作。这个公司今后将为全国各新建、扩建甜菜制糖工厂进行建厂设计工作。
