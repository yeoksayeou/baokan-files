    Why are participants in meetings always supplied with grain by the state?
    In Guang'an County, Sichuan Province, some departments provide grain from the state grain department to personnel attending meetings. For example, the juror conference convened by the county people's court in December last year, the party member training conference convened by the county party committee's organization department, the accounting personnel conference convened by the county party committee's rural work department, and the Communist Youth League's branch secretary conference should not have been supplied with grain by the state, but they were. From November to December 25th last year, there were 31 such meetings, consuming a total of more than 200,000 jin of grain from the state. Some units also inflated the number of participants in meetings to fraudulently purchase state grain. The forestry section of the county people's committee held a bamboo planting conference in December last year. Only 480 people attended, requiring only 1,800 jin of grain, but they purchased more than 2,000 jin from the state. Guang'an County's grain sales in the fourth quarter of last year were very high, exceeding the plan by 14.63%.
    I believe that cadres attending meetings should bring their own grain. Yibo

    每次参加开会的人员为何都由国家供应粮食
    四川省广安县有些部门召开会议时，都要国家粮食部门给参加会议的人员供应粮食。如该县在去年12月份由县人民法院召开的陪审员会议，县委组织部召开的党员训练会议，县委农村工作部召开的会计人员会议，青年团召开的团支部书记会议等，都是不应该由国家供应粮食的，结果却都由国家供应了。去年11月至12月25日，像这样的会议共开了三十一次，共由国家供应粮食二十多万斤。有些单位，还多编造参加会议的人数，骗购国家粮食。县人民委员会林业科，在去年12月召开的栽竹会议，参加人数只有四百八十人，只需要一千八百斤粮食就够吃了，结果却向国家买了二千多斤。广安县去年第四季度的粮食销售量很大，超过计划14.63％。
    我认为开会的干部在开会的时候应该自带粮食。　艺波
