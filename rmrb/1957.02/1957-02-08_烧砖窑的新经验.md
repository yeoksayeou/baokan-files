    New Experiences in Brick Kiln Firing

    (Reported by this newspaper) Li Sizhong, a member of the North Guan Town Brick and Tile Production Cooperative in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, has been actively thinking of ways and finding tricks to improve kiln firing techniques since joining the handicraft cooperative. After painstaking research, he finally created advanced experiences such as "three diligences" (i.e., diligent in adding coal, diligent in turning the fire, and diligent in removing slag), "three voids" (i.e., bottom void, side void, and top void), "three speeds" (i.e., bottom void results in fast front fire, side void results in fast simmering fire, top void results in fast full fire), and "one large" (i.e., a large chimney results in strong fire draft), greatly improving production efficiency.

    In the past, it took fourteen days to fire a kiln of bricks, but now it only takes six days, and the quality is very good. In the past, 7,500 jin of fuel were required for every 10,000 bricks, but after improvement, only 5,500 jin are required.

    烧砖窑的新经验
    本报讯　山西翼城县北关镇砖瓦生产合作社社员李思忠，自参加手工业合作社以来，积极地想办法，找窍门，来提高烧窑的技术。经过他苦心钻研，终于创造了三勤（即添煤勤、翻火勤、出渣勤），三虚（即底虚、边虚、顶虚），三快（即底虚了前火快，边虚了熬火快，顶虚了发火快）和一大（烟筒大了吸火力大）等先进经验，使生产的效率大大地提高。
    过去每烧一窑砖需十四天，现在六天即可烧成，而且质量很好。过去每一万块砖需用燃料七千五百斤，经改进后只需五千五百斤。
