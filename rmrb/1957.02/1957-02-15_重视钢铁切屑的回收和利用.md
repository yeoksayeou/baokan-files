Pay Attention to the Recycling and Utilization of Steel Shavings
    Zhi Deyu

Our country's steel production is insufficient. To meet the needs of large-scale basic construction and industrial production, in addition to continuously increasing steel production, we must also strive to save steel materials.

At present, there is a great deal of waste in steel materials, especially in the machinery manufacturing industry. In production, machinery factories must generate some shavings to cut steel materials into finished products of various shapes. According to recent Soviet statistics, Soviet machinery factories cut away an average of 20%–25% of the weight of castings, 20% of the weight of forgings, and 15% of the weight of bar stock (some mechanical industries, such as machine tool manufacturing, produce even more shavings). In our country, due to the low level of technology, imprecise forgings, and backward forging methods, the proportion of shavings is even greater. Based on this calculation, the annual amount of mechanical industry shavings in our country will exceed 300,000 tons.

If so many steel shavings can be well recycled and utilized, it will greatly make up for the shortage of steel resources. However, our country has always been insufficient in the utilization of steel shavings. On the one hand, it is due to a lack of attention ideologically, and on the other hand, it is also due to the existence of many difficulties in recycling and utilization. For example, steel shavings are bulky and light in weight, making collection, storage, and transportation inconvenient, and easily causing waste of manpower and materials. At present, a more advanced and ideal method is to melt the shavings on-site in the cupola of the foundry workshop of each machinery factory as the charge for cast iron. However, this method has long failed to produce satisfactory results; either the quality of the molten iron is poor, or the furnace is blocked, or the tuyeres are blocked, forcing the smelting process to stop.

The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the recycling and utilization of steel shavings, and has accumulated extremely rich experience. For example, the October Factory in Krasnodar, Soviet Union, used a worm conveyor to send cast iron shavings into the cupola for melting. From 1951 to 1953, it remelted more than 3,000 tons of shavings, saving 300 tons of coke and 980,000 rubles; the manufacturing cost of the worm conveyor was also greatly reduced. Now, this method has been promoted in many factories. Another method is to mix steel shavings into the charge and directly put them into the cupola in piles. As long as the ingredients are correct and the operation is appropriate, excellent molten iron can also be obtained. Even if the entire charge is shavings, molten iron can still be melted in the cupola. This method is simple and easy to implement, and does not require any additional equipment.

In 1954, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory learned from the Soviet experience and successfully melted steel shavings by mixing them into the charge and directly putting them into the furnace. In 1955, the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory began to use steel shavings in the cupola to replace scrap steel. The annual consumption of scrap steel accounted for only 30% of the original plan, and the cost was reduced by 10,000 yuan in half a year. The Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory created a method of using shavings to make steel in an electric furnace, saving more than 370,000 yuan in 1955.

In order to more effectively utilize steel shavings, it is recommended that relevant departments immediately organize forces to quickly translate the relevant Soviet materials so that the staff and workers of machinery factories across the country can widely learn and adopt them. The effective experiences of the Soviet Union in this regard should be promoted in an organized and led manner. For our country's existing experiences, whether they are mature complete sets of experiences, or partial experiences and insights that are still being researched, we must pay attention to them and collect and sort them out. There are also some folk methods of utilizing shavings in our country. For example, a Gonghe Iron Factory in Changchun City has used hot blast furnaces to melt steel shavings into cast iron blocks for many years. These methods should also be well studied.

If we can diligently promote these experiences, we can save hundreds of thousands of tons of steel every year, which can not only reduce the product prices of machinery manufacturing plants, but also improve the contradiction of lack of steel to a certain extent.

    重视钢铁切屑的回收和利用
    支德瑜
    我国的钢铁产量不足。为了满足大规模的基本建设及工业生产的需要，除不断增加钢铁产量外，还要努力节约钢铁用料。
    目前，在钢铁用料上的浪费是很大的，特别是在机械制造工业方面。机械工厂在生产中，为了将钢铁材料切削成各种形状的成品，总要产生一些切屑。根据苏联最近的统计，苏联各机械工厂在切削加工中，平均要切削掉铸件重量的20％—25％、锻件重量的20％、棒料重量的15％（有些机械工业如机床制造工业产生的切屑还要多一些）。在我国，由于技术水平低，锻件不精密，锻造方法落后，切屑的比重也就更大一些。依此推算，我国全年机械工业切屑量将超过三十万吨。
    这样多的钢铁切屑，如果能够很好地回收和利用，会在很大程度上弥补钢铁资源的不足。但是，我国历来对于钢铁切屑的利用还是很不够的。一方面是由于思想上不重视，一方面也由于在回收和利用方面还存在着许多困难。如钢铁切屑体积大、重量小，收集、保管、运输都不方便，而且容易造成人力物力上的浪费。目前，比较先进的和理想的办法，是在各机械厂就地将切屑在铸工车间冲天炉中熔化，作为铸铁的炉料。但是，这个办法长期以来都得不到满意的结果，不是铁水质量不好，便是炉子堵塞，风口堵塞，迫使熔炼过程中止。
    苏联对于回收和利用钢铁切屑非常重视，而且积累了极为丰富的经验。如苏联克拉斯诺达城十月工厂利用蜗杆输送器将铸铁切屑送入冲天炉熔化，自1951年至1953年三年间共重熔了三千多吨切屑，并因此节约了焦炭三百吨，节约金额共达九十八万卢布；蜗杆输送器的制造价格也大大降低。现在，这个方法已经在不少工厂中推广。还有一种方法，就是将钢铁切屑掺入炉料，成堆地直接投入冲天炉，只要配料正确，操作适当，也能获得优良的铁水。甚至全部炉料是切屑，也仍旧能够在冲天炉中熔化出铁水。这种方法简而易行，不需要增加任何设备。
    上海机床厂在1954年学习苏联经验，将钢铁切屑掺入炉料直接投炉熔炼，获得成功。南京机床厂在1955年开始利用钢切屑加入冲天炉，代替了废钢，全年废钢耗量仅占原计划的30％，在半年中降低了成本一万元。四方机车车辆工厂创造了在电炉中应用切屑炼钢的方法，1955年便节约了三十七万多元。
    为了更有效地利用钢铁切屑，建议有关部门立即组织力量，将苏联的有关资料迅速地翻译出来，以便全国各机械工厂的职工广泛学习采用。对于苏联的有关这方面行之有效的经验，应该有组织有领导地推广。对于我国已有的经验，不论是已经成熟的成套的经验，还是部分的尚在研究的经验及心得体会，都要加以重视和收集整理。我国民间也有一些利用切屑的办法，如长春市有一个共和铁工厂，多年来曾用热风炉熔化钢切屑成为铸铁块。对这些方法也应很好研究。
    如果我们能够兢兢业业地推广这些经验，我们每年便可以节约几十万吨的钢铁，不仅机械制造厂的产品价格可以降低，而且缺乏钢铁的矛盾也会在一定的程度上得到改善。
