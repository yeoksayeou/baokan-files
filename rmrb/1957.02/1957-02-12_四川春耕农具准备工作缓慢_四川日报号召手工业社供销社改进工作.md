Sichuan Spring Ploughing Farm Tool Preparation Work is Slow
    Sichuan Daily Calls on Handicraft Cooperatives and Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to Improve Work
    (By this newspaper) The preparation work for spring ploughing production tools in Sichuan Province this year is progressing slowly. One of the main reasons is the insufficient coordination between the supply and marketing cooperative departments and the handicraft production departments, and even the phenomenon of shirking responsibility to each other. Some handicraft production cooperatives (or county federations), on the one hand, are shouting about financial difficulties and insufficient raw materials, but on the other hand, they use most of the raw materials and labor to produce consumer goods that can earn more money, and do not actively produce spring ploughing production tools. For example, the woodworking production cooperatives in Zhao Town and Chengxiang and other places in Jintang County once used about 50%-70% of their labor force to produce consumer goods. The county originally planned to store more than 1.9 million catties of bamboo raw materials for spring ploughing production this year, but it did not actively purchase them early. Some supply and marketing cooperatives took this opportunity to emphasize "insufficient supply" and adopted the attitude of "selling out the inventory," failing to actively reserve raw materials and help handicraft and rural sideline industries overcome difficulties in production.
    For this reason, the Sichuan Daily published an editorial on January 29, calling on handicraft production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to actively cooperate and do a good job in preparing farm tools for spring ploughing production. The editorial pointed out that the reason why the supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives do not cooperate well or even shirk responsibility to each other is that they all have their own small plans. After it was proposed in the second half of last year that "locally produced and sold" products could be produced and sold by handicraft production cooperatives themselves, the handicraft production cooperatives felt that the production of farm tools was technically strong, troublesome, piecemeal, and did not earn much money, so they were not active in production. The supply and marketing cooperatives believed that operating production materials was troublesome, piecemeal, and did not earn much money. If the supply was not good, the masses, the Party committee, and the higher-level cooperatives would criticize them. Now that the handicraft cooperatives are producing and selling themselves, they can take this opportunity to get rid of the matter. Some cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives also said: Now the supply and marketing cooperatives are only responsible for supply, as for the source of goods, that is the business of the handicraft department, and if the supply is insufficient in the future, "I will not be responsible."
    The editorial said that changing the purchasing and selling relationship between the supply and marketing cooperatives and the handicraft production cooperatives is to adapt to the current new situation and better serve production. Therefore, whether it is a handicraft production cooperative or a supply and marketing cooperative, after changing the purchasing and selling relationship, they should not adopt an attitude of shirking responsibility for farm tool production, but should better cooperate with each other, do a better job in farm tool production, cooperate together, and better serve agricultural production; otherwise, it would violate the fundamental purpose of improving the purchasing and selling relationship and better serving production. Now, a spring ploughing production campaign that is larger in scale than in previous years is about to begin, and preparing to supply farm tools for spring ploughing production is already an urgent task for the supply and marketing cooperative departments and handicraft production departments. According to the understanding of relevant departments in Jintang County, the demand for farm tools for spring ploughing production this year is generally about 20% higher than last year. Moreover, farmers generally purchased fewer farm tools for spring ploughing production in the fourth quarter of last year, and they will inevitably concentrate on purchasing them before spring ploughing this year. If preparations are not made immediately, farm tools will be out of stock, which will seriously affect the smooth development of the spring ploughing production campaign.
    The editorial finally hoped that the Party and government leading departments in various places would seize the time to conduct an inspection of the preparation work for farm tools for spring ploughing production, and effectively change the phenomenon of mutual shirking of responsibility and non-active production by the supply and marketing cooperative departments and handicraft production departments. On this basis, help solve specific problems in cooperation, strengthen mutual cooperation, and greatly promote the preparation of farm tools for spring ploughing production.

### 四川春耕农具准备工作缓慢  四川日报号召手工业社供销社改进工作

    四川春耕农具准备工作缓慢
    四川日报号召手工业社供销社改进工作
    本报讯　四川省今年春耕生产农具的准备工作进展缓慢，主要原因之一是供销合作部门和手工业生产部门之间配合得不够密切，甚至还有互相推卸责任的现象。有些手工业生产合作社（或县联社），一方面叫喊资金困难，原材料不足，另方面却把大部分原料和劳动力用去生产那些可以多赚钱的生活资料，不积极生产春耕生产农具。例如，金堂县赵镇和城厢等地的木器生产合作社，就曾经一度把50％—70％左右的劳动力都用去生产生活资料。全县今年春耕生产原计划储备竹器原料一百九十多万斤，也没有及早地积极收购。有些供销合作社则借此强调“货源不足”，抱着“把库存卖完了事”的态度，不积极储备原料，不积极帮助手工业和农村副业克服生产中的困难。
    为此，四川日报1月29日发表社论号召手工业生产合作社和供销社积极配合，作好春耕生产的农具准备工作。社论指出：供销合作社和手工业生产合作社之所以配合得不够甚至互相推卸责任，是因为他们都有自己的小打算。去年下半年提出“地产地销”的产品可以由手工业生产合作社自产自销以后，手工业生产合作社嫌生产农具的技术性强、麻烦、零星、赚钱又少，便不积极生产。供销合作社就认为经营生产资料麻烦、零星、赚钱少，万一供应不好，群众、党委、上级社都要批评；现在既然由手工业社自产自销，他们也就可以趁此推出门了事。供销合作社有的干部还说：现在供销社只负责供应，至于货源如何，那是手工业部门的事情，将来供应不足，“恕我概不负责”。
    社论中说，改变供销合作社和手工业生产合作社之间购销关系是为了适应目前新的情况，更好地为生产服务。因此，无论是手工业生产合作社或是供销合作社，在改变购销关系后，对于农具生产都不应该采取互相推诿的态度，而是应该更好地互相配合，把生产农具的工作搞得更好，共同合作，更好地为农业生产服务；否则，就违背了改进购销关系，更好地为生产服务的根本目的。现在，规模比往年更加浩大的春耕生产运动即将开始，作好供应春耕生产农具的准备工作，已经是供销合作部门和手工业生产合作部门迫不及待的任务。据金堂县有关部门的了解，今年春耕生产农具的需要量，一般约比去年增加20％左右。而且，去年第四季度农民购买春耕生产农具的一般都较少，势必集中在今年春耕前购买。如果不立即充分准备，将造成农具脱销，严重影响春耕生产运动的顺利开展。
    社论最后希望各地党政领导部门，抓紧时间对春耕生产农具的准备工作作一次检查，切实改变供销合作部门和手工业生产部门互相推诿、不积极生产的现象。在这基础上，帮助解决配合中的具体问题，加强相互间的配合，把春耕生产的农具准备工作大大推进一步。
