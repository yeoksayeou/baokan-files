    Heilongjiang, Jilin
    Supply Other Provinces with Large Numbers of Draught Animals
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 26th. Heilongjiang Province, a major horse-producing area in the country, will supply Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Liaoning provinces with 13,000 draught horses in the first quarter of this year to support agricultural production in these provinces. Procurement personnel from Henan, Hebei, and Liaoning provinces have already come to Heilongjiang Province to select and purchase horses.
    The horses planned to support other provinces are of relatively good quality and are all between four and five years old.
    This newspaper reports that Jilin Province, in the spirit of both ensuring the needs of the province and vigorously supporting the development of agricultural production in fraternal provinces, has conducted a comprehensive plan for draught animals and actively carried out inter-provincial draught animal adjustments. In 1956, it transferred 28,000 head of various draught animals to Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and other provinces, and this year it will continue to transfer 25,000 head of various draught animals to support spring plowing production.
