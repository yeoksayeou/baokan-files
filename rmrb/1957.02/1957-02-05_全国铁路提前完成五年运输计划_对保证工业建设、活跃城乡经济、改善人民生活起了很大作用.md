Xinhua News Agency, 4th. National railways have completed the first Five-Year Transportation Plan approximately one year ahead of schedule. According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways, last year the national railways transported a total of over 250 million passengers and over 245.5 million tons of freight. Compared with the 1957 targets stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, passenger traffic exceeded the target by over 4.4 million people, and freight traffic exceeded the target by over 190,000 tons.

The Five-Year Plan stipulated that the national railway passenger turnover should be 31.966 billion person-kilometers, and the freight turnover should be 120.9 billion ton-kilometers. These two targets were also completed ahead of schedule in October last year and the end of January this year, respectively.

The first Five-Year Plan for the development of China's national economy placed very heavy tasks on railway transportation. Especially in 1956, due to the rapid surge in industrial production and capital construction, railway transportation became even busier. On all major railway lines across the country, trains fully loaded with goods traveled back and forth like shuttles. The western section of the Longhai Railway, China's major east-west artery, had an average of only ten pairs of freight trains passing through it every day in 1953, but this increased to seventeen pairs in 1956. Every month, hundreds of thousands of tons of various construction and daily necessities were transported to the Northwest via this railway.

Compared with 1952, the year before the start of the Five-Year Plan, the national railway passenger traffic increased by 52.4% in 1956, and the freight traffic increased by 86%. The percentage increase in passenger and freight turnover was even greater. Among the freight volume, bulk transportation materials such as coal and coke, steel and machinery equipment, petroleum and its products, mineral building materials, and timber have all increased by a large margin, ranging from one-half to about two times.

The development of railway transportation has not only powerfully guaranteed China's socialist industrial construction but also played a significant role in activating the urban and rural economy and improving the material and cultural life of urban and rural people. This is particularly evident in newly built railway areas. In Fujian Province, before railway transportation existed, due to inconvenient transportation and high freight rates, many local and special products produced in the mountainous areas of Fujian, such as fir, bamboo, shiitake mushrooms, and dried bamboo shoots, were very cheap and even unwanted. The local people described it as a fir tree not being as valuable as a bamboo, and a bamboo not being as valuable as a sugarcane. The opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway changed the economic landscape of the mountainous rural areas of Fujian. The local and special products that had been heavily stockpiled and unable to be sold in the past are now being sold, and even bamboo branches and leaves that no one wanted to burn as firewood in the past have now become hot commodities. The industrial products bought by the people in the mountainous areas are also cheaper due to lower freight rates. Due to climatic conditions, there is a severe shortage of vegetables in northern China during the winter. However, through railway refrigerated transport, residents of cities such as Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin, and Qiqihar can now eat various fresh vegetables transported from the south in winter.

In the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, the vast majority of the increasing transportation volume of China's railways was borne by the existing railways. In order to meet the needs of transportation development, in addition to building more than 4,300 kilometers of new railways in the past four years, the state has also carried out many arduous technical transformation works on the existing railways. On the major trunk lines with very busy transportation, approximately 800 kilometers of double tracks have been newly built and repaired, thirteen major hub stations have been expanded and are being expanded, and more than 500 new and repaired locomotives, more than 1,900 passenger cars, and more than 27,000 freight cars have been purchased and repaired. Railway communication and signaling equipment have also been greatly improved. China's new technological equipment on the railways—the electrical signal device that can automatically display whether there are trains in the line section—automatic blocking—has begun to be built on some lines last year.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, spanning the Yangtze River and connecting the Beijing-Hankou and Yuehan railways, will also be basically completed this year.

These constructions have greatly changed the face of China's railways. The railway network is gradually extending to the interior and border areas of the motherland. The original technically backward railways are also gradually moving towards modern standards.

In completing the first Five-Year Transportation Plan ahead of schedule, the technical management level of China's railways has greatly improved. In recent years, the national railway workers have carried out the full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movement. Last year, on the basis of this movement, they carried out the locomotive daily production of one million ton-kilometers movement, which fully exerted the efficiency of railway transportation equipment. In 1956, the average total weight towed by each freight locomotive on the national railways reached 1,513 tons, an increase of more than 260 tons compared with 1952. In this way, the goods that originally required six trains to complete can now be completed with only five trains. Due to the continuous improvement of loading technology and the use of large vehicles, the amount of goods loaded in each vehicle has also been further improved compared to the past. The speed of trains is also faster than in the past.

### 全国铁路提前完成五年运输计划  对保证工业建设、活跃城乡经济、改善人民生活起了很大作用

    全国铁路提前完成五年运输计划
    对保证工业建设、活跃城乡经济、改善人民生活起了很大作用
    新华社4日讯　全国铁路提前一年左右完成第一个五年运输计划。据铁道部统计，去年一年全国铁路总共运输旅客二亿五千多万人、货物二亿四千五百五十多万吨。同五年计划规定的1957年指标比较，旅客超过四百四十多万人，货物超过十九万多吨。
    五年计划规定的全国铁路旅客周转量是三百一十九亿六千六百万人公里，货物周转量是一千二百零九亿吨公里，这两项指标也已经分别在去年10月和今年1月底提前完成。
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，给铁路运输提出了十分繁重的任务。特别是1956年，由于工业生产和基本建设的迅速高涨，铁路运输更形繁忙。在全国各个主要的铁路干线上，满载货物的一列列火车像穿梭一样地来往奔驰。我国东西大动脉——陇海铁路的西段，1953年平均每天只有十对货物列车通过，1956年增加到了十七对。每月经过这条铁路运往西北的各种建设和生活所需的物资，有几十万吨之多。
    同五年计划开始前一年——1952年比较，1956年全国铁路的旅客运量增长了52.4％，货物运量增长了86％。旅客周转量和货物周转量增长的百分比还更大。在货物运量中，煤和焦炭、钢铁和机器设备、石油及其制品、矿物性建筑材料以及木材等大宗运输物资，都增长一大半到两倍左右。
    铁路运输的发展，不仅有力地保证了我国社会主义的工业建设，而且对于活跃城乡经济，改善城乡人民的物质文化生活也起了很大作用。特别是新建铁路的地区，表现特别显著。福建省在没有铁路运输以前，因交通不便，运价昂贵，闽中山区盛产的杉木、毛竹、香菇和笋干等许多土产品和特产品，价钱很贱，甚至没人要。当地群众形容说，一根杉木不如一根毛竹值钱，一根毛竹不如一根甘蔗值钱。鹰厦铁路的通车，改变了福建山区农村的经济面貌。以前大量积压卖不出去的土产品和特产品，现在卖出去了，甚至连过去当柴烧都没有人要的竹枝竹叶，现在也成了热货。山区人民买的工业品因运价低廉，价格也降低了。我国北方因气候关系，冬天蔬菜非常缺乏。但是通过铁路的冷藏运输，现在北京、沈阳、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等城市居民在冬天也可以吃到南方运来的各种新鲜的蔬菜了。
    在五年计划的头四年中，我国铁路日益增长的运输量绝大部分是由原有的铁路承担的。为了适应运输发展的需要，国家在过去四年中，除建筑了四千三百多公里的新铁路以外，对于原有的铁路也进行了许多艰巨的技术改造工作。在运输十分繁忙的主要干线上，已经新建和修复的复线有八百公里左右，已经扩建和正在扩建的主要枢纽车站有十三个，新购和修复的机车有五百多台，客车一千九百多辆，货车两万七千多辆。铁路的通讯和信号设备也有了很大的改善。我国铁路上的新技术装备——能够自动显示线路区间有无列车的电气信号装置——自动闭塞，去年已经开始在部分线路上建设起来。
    横跨长江的联结京汉和粤汉两条铁路的武汉长江大桥，也将在今年内基本建成。
    这些建设使我国铁路的面貌起了很大的变化。铁路网正在逐步地向祖国的内地和边疆延伸。原有的技术落后的铁路也正在逐步地向着现代化的标准迈进。
    在提前完成第一个五年运输计划中，我国铁路的技术管理水平有了很大的提高。几年来，全国铁路职工开展了满载、超轴、五百公里运动，去年又在这个运动的基础上开展了机车日产百万吨公里的运动，使铁路的运输设备效能得到了充分的发挥。1956年，全国铁路平均每个货运机车每次牵引的总重达一千五百一十三吨，比1952年增加了二百六十多吨。这样，原来需要六趟列车才能拉完的货物，现在只要五趟就拉完了。由于不断改进装载技术和采用大型车辆，每个车辆所装的货物也比过去有了进一步的提高。列车的速度也比过去快了。
