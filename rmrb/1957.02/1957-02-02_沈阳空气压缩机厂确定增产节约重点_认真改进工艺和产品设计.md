    Shenyang Air Compressor Factory Determines Key Points for Increased Production and Economy
    Conscientiously Improving Technology and Product Design
    (This report) This newspaper reports that the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory's focus for increasing production and economy this year lies in improving technology to increase material utilization and improving design to enhance product performance. Last year, in order to avoid reducing production, the factory mobilized all employees to find sources of materials, such as digging up scrap iron from the soil, cleaning warehouses, and recycling iron filings. These measures proved very effective, collecting over 700 tons of scrap iron, and with metal found outside the factory, the total reached over 1,000 tons. This solved last year's production needs and prepared materials for the first quarter of this year.
    According to the factory负责人, the possibility of increasing material sources is limited, it is currently necessary to save materials from the production process. Therefore, this year the factory's focus is on conservation. In January, they have already taken two measures. One is to improve technology to increase material utilization. Taking the 190 horsepower air compressor as an example, the material utilization rate is only 54%. They mobilized relevant departments and workshops to jointly study the machining allowance of this product and improve process regulations. Research has found that the potential is indeed very large. Generally, the machining allowance of parts can be compressed by 2 to 5 millimeters. For example, the crankshaft used to weigh 390 kilograms when blanked, but after compressing the machining allowance, it only reaches 342 kilograms, reducing 48 kilograms. The machining allowance on one side of the crankshaft's journal diameter is compressed from 20 millimeters to 12.5 millimeters. After compressing the machining allowance of another important part, the cylinder liner casting, the air weight also drops from 122 kilograms to 54.7 kilograms. According to the new technology, each machine can save 700 kilograms of steel, and enough material is saved to make one extra machine for every six machines made. The new technology has been tested and adopted on nineteen parts, and will be fully promoted on all parts. Another measure is to improve the design to improve product performance. This is a more fundamental and more active way to save. For example, the original design of the 300 horsepower air compressor was relatively outdated, and there were some shortcomings in both performance and structure, so the machine's performance was not ideal. After a comprehensive inspection and careful research by the designers, the design of the cylinder and ventilation cooling structure was improved, which increased the exhaust volume per minute from 38 cubic meters to 41 cubic meters, an increase of nearly one-tenth. At the same time, the original belt drive was changed to a direct motor drive, which reduced the factory building area occupied by each machine from 26 square meters to 14 square meters, saving 15 million yuan in factory building investment. When using the machine, the power consumption can be reduced by one-tenth compared to before. What is particularly important is that the savings in the manufacturing process of a machine is only one-time, while the savings in the use process is multiple. This saves a lot of wealth for the country. Now, this improved new 300 horsepower air compressor has been officially put into production in January. This is their new development in saving raw materials this year. They have fully arranged this work, preparing to inspect and improve the technology and machining allowance of each product one by one. (Jin Yukun)

    沈阳空气压缩机厂确定增产节约重点
    认真改进工艺和产品设计
    本报讯　沈阳空气压缩机厂今年增产节约重点放在改进工艺提高材料利用率，改进设计提高产品的性能上。去年这个厂为了争取不减产，曾经发动全体职工寻找材料来源，如从土中挖掘废钢铁、清理仓库和回收铁屑等措施，就收到很大的效果，搜集了七百多吨废钢铁，加上在厂外搜到的金属就达千吨以上。这样就解决了去年的生产需要并为今年第一季度准备了材料。
    据工厂负责人谈：开源还是有一定的限度的，目前更需要从生产过程中节约材料。因此今年这个厂重点是放在节约上。在1月份里，他们已采取了两方面的措施。一是改进工艺提高材料的利用率。以一百九十马力空气压缩机为例，材料的利用率仅达54％。他们发动了有关科室和车间一起研究压缩这种产品的加工余量和改进工艺规程。研究中发现潜力确实很大，一般零件都可压缩加工余量二至五公厘，如曲轴过去下料时重三百九十公斤，压缩加工余量后仅达三百四十二公斤，可减少四十八公斤。曲轴的轴径的一面的加工余量由二十公厘压缩到十二点五公厘。另一种重要零件缸套铸件压缩加工余量后，气重亦由一百二十二公斤降为五十四点七公斤。按照新的工艺一台机器就可节约钢铁七百公斤，每做六台就可多出一台的材料。现在新的工艺经过试验已在十九种零件上采用，而且就将在所有的零件上全部推广采用。另一个措施就是改进设计提高产品的性能。这是更根本更积极的节约办法。如三百马力空气压缩机，原来的设计，已较陈旧，无论性能结构都存在一些缺点，因此机器的性能都不够理想。经过设计人员全面检查和慎重研究后，就改进了汽缸和通气冷却等结构的设计，这样就使每分钟的排气量由三十八立方公尺提高到四十一立方公尺，提高了近十分之一。同时又将原来的皮带传动改为电动机直接传动，就使过去每台机器占用厂房面积二十六平方公尺减少到十四平方公尺，就可节约一千五百万元的厂房投资。在使用机器时电力消耗比以前可节约十分之一。特别重要的是，一台机器在制造过程中的节约仅是一次，而在使用过程中的节约是多次的。这为国家节约了很多财富。现在，这种改进后新型三百马力空气压缩机已在1月里正式投入生产。这就是他们今年节约原材料的新发展。他们已经全面安排了这方面的工作。准备逐个地检查和改进每个产品的工艺和加工余量。	　（金雨困）
