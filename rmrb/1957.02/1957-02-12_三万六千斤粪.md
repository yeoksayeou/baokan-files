    36,000 Jin of Manure
    Chen Shouxing, a member of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Xinjie Township, Quxi County, Yunnan, is almost sixty years old this year. Because of his age and illness, he cannot do heavy work, so he is determined to collect more manure for fertilizer. Wherever he goes, he takes his manure basket with him.
    This year, after the advanced cooperative changed the method of valuing fertilizer as an investment to recording work points for accumulated fertilizer and distributing dividends, he became even more enthusiastic about accumulating fertilizer. He proposed to accumulate 36,000 jin of fertilizer and strive to exceed that amount. An old lady smiled disbelievingly and said to him:
    "Exceed the pot! Exceed the steamer!" But he said confidently: "For the cooperative to increase production, I will definitely be able to overfulfill the quota!" One evening, he asked the captain, Chen Yingde, for an advance on his wages. The captain smiled and agreed, saying: "Okay! Write a requisition slip, but you can't forget your manure accumulation guarantee!" Little did he know that the money he borrowed was used to buy manure baskets. ·Yong Yu·

    三万六千斤粪
    云南曲溪县新街乡红光农业社社员陈寿兴，今年已经快六十岁了。因为年老又有病，重活不能干，所以他就决心多拾粪肥。不管他走到那里，粪箕就提到那里。
    今年高级社把肥料折价投资的办法改为积肥记工分分红的办法后，他更有心肠积肥了。他提出要积肥三万六千斤，还要争取超过。有位老大妈不相信地笑着对他说：
  “超锅！超甑子吧！”但他信心十足地说：“为了合作社增产，一定能够超额完成！”一天晚上，他向队长陈应德预支钱，队长笑嘻嘻的答应他说：“好嘛！开个借支条子来，可是积肥的保证不能忘记哦！”那知道他借支的钱是用来买粪箕的。　·用予·
