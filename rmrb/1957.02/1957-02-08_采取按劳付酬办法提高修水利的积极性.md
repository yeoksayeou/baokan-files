According to the Henan Daily: Changtai Township in Xinyang County has adopted a piece-rate payment method in water conservancy construction, which has ignited the enthusiasm of commune members.

The township has a total of eighteen agricultural cooperatives. Last winter, the plan was to build 260 ponds, 32 weirs, and 9 dams. In the beginning, due to unreasonable work points, commune members were not enthusiastic about water conservancy construction. In the Gaozhai team of the Sixth Brigade of the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative, three people carried and nine people dug, and they only managed to move a little over one cubic meter of earth per day. After the management committees of each cooperative discovered this situation, they promptly adjusted the work points and adopted a contracting system to stimulate everyone's enthusiasm. The Fuxing Agricultural Cooperative stipulated: carrying one cubic meter of earth within 25 zhang is 8 points, 30 to 35 zhang is 12 points, and within 50 zhang is 16 points. In this way, everyone was very satisfied. Commune member Zhang Kaiyuan originally carried less than 0.3 cubic meters of earth a day, but now he can carry 1.2 cubic meters a day. According to the statistics of the whole township for ten days, a total of 86 ponds, 2 weirs, and 4 dams were built. The commune members guaranteed to complete the winter construction plan before the end of the lunar year.

    采取按劳付酬办法提高修水利的积极性
    本报讯　据河南日报报道：信阳县长台乡在兴修水利中实行按劳取酬的办法，掀起了社员兴修水利的热潮。
    这个乡共有十八个农业社，去冬计划修塘二百六十个、堰三十二处、坝九条。开始由于工分不合理，社员们对兴修水利不积极。金星农业社六大队高寨小队，三个人担，九个人挖，一天只搞一方多土。各社管理委员会发现这一情况后，及时调整工分，采用包工制的办法来激发大家的积极性。复兴农业社规定：二十五丈以内担一个土方是八分，三十至三十五丈是十二分，五十丈以内的十六分。这样以来，大家都很满意。社员张开元原来一天担不到零点三土方，现在每天能担一点二土方。全乡十天的统计，共修塘八十六口、堰两处、坝四条。社员们保证旧历年底完成冬修计划。
