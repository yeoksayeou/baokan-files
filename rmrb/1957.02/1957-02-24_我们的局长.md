    Our Bureau Chief
    Sun Minyou
    A few days ago, I ran into some comrades who used to work together at the Ministry of Commerce. We all spontaneously talked about Comrade Liu Yi, the former director of the Industrial Equipment Trading Bureau who led us in 1953 and 1954, and everyone missed him very much. The following are some fragments I remember of Comrade Liu Yi in his work and life.
    He was a veteran Communist Party member, already over fifty years old. For the first month or so after he came to work at the Ministry of Commerce, he rarely spoke at meetings. I thought his personality must be very solitary. But the facts proved my idea was wrong. Later, he not only often expressed his opinions, but his opinions were also very correct. Only then did I realize that the reason he didn't like to speak at first was because he had just arrived in this unfamiliar place and was not very familiar with the situation.
    Once, he led several comrades from the bureau to the countryside and asked me to issue some letters of introduction. Because it was to the county level, in addition to the usual statement of his position and work tasks in the letter, I finally asked the local people's governments to provide assistance. As soon as he saw it, he added the words "guidance" above "assistance." At that time, I raised a different opinion: "You are the director of the Central Ministry of Commerce. Who can you ask to guide you when you go to the county?" He smiled and said, "The comrades in the county can guide me, because I don't know much about the situation below, and I can only learn from them diligently."
    Every time his working group arrived at or left a county, they had to report their work to the local administrative负责人 (fù zé rén - person in charge) and solicit their opinions. Once, after finishing work in a county, the comrades in the county didn't have time and needed to wait another day to report. At that time, the working group had to rush to another county, and many comrades advocated telling them and leaving, without giving a detailed report. But he decided to wait another day and insisted on reporting before leaving.
    Once, the bureau organized an autumn trip, and the bureau chief also participated. The car we had borrowed was driven away by another bureau. At that time, I was very angry and wanted to reason with the trade union负责人 (fù zé rén - person in charge) of that bureau. The bureau chief stopped me and told me, "Don't be impatient when talking to people. If they must use it, we can borrow another car. It doesn't matter if we leave later." The result of our negotiation was very good, and the car was returned to us. But the driver we had originally agreed upon had not arrived. The driver from that bureau was laughing and chatting beside him. At that time, I started complaining again: "What kind of work style is this? They drove away the car we had borrowed. Now they have returned the car to us, and seeing that we don't have a driver, they are laughing beside us. This is really gloating!" Our bureau chief took over and said, "We can't say that. We can only blame our own organization work for not being done well. Can we blame others for the fact that our own agreed-upon driver hasn't arrived?" Hearing these words, my face immediately felt hot.
    Now I am no longer working with our bureau chief, but every time I recall these past events, I can't help but feel infinite respect and love for him.

    我们的局长
    孙民友
    前些天碰到了几个过去在商业部一起工作过的同志。我们不约而同地谈起了1953年到1954年领导过我们的前工业器材贸易局局长刘毅同志，大家对他都很怀念。下面是我记起的刘毅同志在工作和生活中的几个片断。
    他是一个老共产党员，已经有五十多岁了。他到商业部工作最初的一个月左右，在会议上很少说话。我想，他的个性一定很孤僻。但事实却证明了我的想法是错误的。以后他不但常发表意见，而且意见都很正确。这时我才明白，最初他不爱发言，原来是因为刚来到这个生疏的地方，对情况还不大熟悉。
    一次他领导局里的几个同志下乡，要我给开几封介绍信。因为是到县里去，我在信上除了照例写明他的职务和工作任务以外，最后是要求各地人民政府予以协助。他一看就在“协助”上面又加了“指导”两个字。当时我就提出了不同的意见：“你是中央商业部的局长，到县里去可叫谁来指导你呢？”他笑着说：“县里的同志都可以指导我，因为我不大了解下面的情况，只有好好地向人家学习。”
    他领导的工作组，每来到或离开一个县的时候，都要向当地行政负责人汇报工作，征求他们的意见。一次，在一个县结束工作后，正好县里的同志没有时间，需要再等一天才能汇报。当时工作组还要赶到别的县去，很多同志都主张向他们说一声就走，不要再作详细汇报了。但他却决定再等一天，一定要汇报了再走。
    一次局里组织秋季旅行，局长也参加了。我们已经借好的汽车被另一个局给开走了。当时我很气愤，要找那个局的工会负责人讲理去。局长却把我叫住，告诉我：“和人家说话不要急躁。如果他们一定要用，我们可以另外借一辆车。晚一些出发不要紧。”我们去交涉的结果很好，车还给了我们。但是我们原来约定好的司机还没有来。那个局的司机却在旁边有说有笑。当时我又发开了牢骚：“这叫什么作风？我们借好的车子，他们给开了去。现在把车给了我们，看到我们没有司机，却在旁边笑。这真是幸灾乐祸！”我们的局长却接过来说：“这可不能那样说。这只能怪我们自己的组织工作没有做好。难道我们自己约好的司机没有来也怪人家吗？”听了这话，我脸上立刻一热。
    现在我和我们的局长已经不在一起工作，但每一回忆起这些往事，就不由得对他产生出无限的敬爱。
