Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference continued this morning. Zhang Xingyu, the Chinese Communist Party Secretary of Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, who led the entire county to average 3.8 pigs per household in 1956, served as the executive chairman.

At this morning's meeting, the speeches of two female representatives were warmly welcomed by the entire audience. They were Li Guifang, the leader of a tractor team in a certain unit of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, who led her team to complete a task scheduled for three years and four months in just one year, and Li Guixing, an accountant from the Jiusheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County of Guangxi Province, who is dedicated to working in ethnic minority areas. Li Guifang said that the main reason their tractor team was able to overfulfill their work quota was because they utilized the wisdom and work enthusiasm of the masses. To ensure more daylight hours for cultivation, they scheduled equipment maintenance and repairs for the evenings. Sometimes, due to the distance to the fields, they would camp in the open at night to avoid wasting time on travel. Through careful planning and improving the utilization rate of the tractors in all aspects, they cultivated and planted over 47,900 mu in a year, while the farm's annual quota was only 14,000 mu. Because they strictly implemented equipment maintenance and production increase and savings systems, the time lost due to equipment failures throughout the year accounted for only 0.1% of the total working time. At the same time, they also saved more than 800 kilograms of gasoline.

Li Guixing is a Han Chinese girl who has a strong enthusiasm for running agricultural production cooperatives well for ethnic minorities. She can overcome difficulties in her work, which has led to success. When she first started working in Damiaoshan, she was unfamiliar with the work, did not speak the language, and was not used to the lifestyle. However, in less than a year, she overcame these difficulties, basically learned the Miao language, and became familiar with accounting work. Because she is conscientious, responsible, and loves the Miao farmers, she is loved, trusted, and respected by the Miao farmers.

Also reporting on abundant harvest achievements and experiences at this morning's meeting were Liang Yin, director of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Liangjiadun Township, Zhangye County, Gansu Province; Yue Caihui, director of the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Qian Gorlos Mongol Autonomous County, Jilin Province; and Guan Jiyun, director of the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Jin County, Liaoning Province.

In the afternoon, all the representatives attending the meeting attended the opening ceremony of the National Agricultural Exhibition and visited the Agricultural Exhibition.

In the evening, representatives from Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps also held a symposium to exchange their high-yield and large-area abundant harvest experiences in cotton and wheat production.

    农业劳动模范代表继续报告丰产经验
    新华社20日讯　全国农业劳动模范代表会议今天上午继续举行。担任执行主席的是领导全县1956年平均每户养猪三点八头的湖南省望城县的中共县委书记张兴玉。
    在今天上午的会议上，有两位女代表的发言受到了全场热烈的欢迎。她们是，领导一个拖拉机小组以一年时间完成三年零四个月任务的新疆生产建设兵团某部拖拉机小组长李桂芳，热爱在少数民族地区工作的广西省大苗山苗族自治县九同农业生产合作社会计黎桂兴。李桂芳说，她（他）们的拖拉机小组所以能超额完成工作任务，主要是发挥了群众的智慧和工作积极性。为了保证白天有更长的时间进行耕作，她们就将机具的保养检修工作都放到晚上进行。有时因出车路远，为避免往返浪费时间，晚上她们就在野外露营。由于精打细算，从各方面提高了车的利用率，她们一年中的耕播面积达到了四万七千九百多亩，而农场的全年定额只有一万四千亩。由于她们严格执行了机具保养和增产节约制度，因此，全年机具发生故障所浪费的时间只占整个工作时间的0.1％，同时还节约了八百多公斤汽油。
    黎桂兴是个汉族姑娘，她有为少数民族办好农业生产合作社的饱满热情，在工作中能够克服困难，因而使工作做出了成绩。她初到大苗山工作时，业务生疏、语言不通，生活也过不惯。但是，不到一年她就克服了这些困难，基本上学会了苗族语言，熟悉了会计业务。由于她工作认真负责，和热爱苗族农民，因此她也受到苗族农民的热爱、信任和尊敬。
    在今日上午会议上报告丰产成绩和丰产经验的，还有甘肃省张掖县梁家墩乡先锋农业社主任梁寅、吉林省前郭尔罗斯蒙古族自治县黎明农业社主任岳采辉和辽宁省金县胜利农业社主任冠吉运等三人。
    下午，参加会议的全体代表出席了全国农业展览会的开幕式，并参观了农业展览会。
    晚上，山东、山西、陕西和新疆生产建设兵团的代表还举行了座谈会，交流了他们在棉花、小麦生产方面的高额丰产经验和大面积丰产经验。
