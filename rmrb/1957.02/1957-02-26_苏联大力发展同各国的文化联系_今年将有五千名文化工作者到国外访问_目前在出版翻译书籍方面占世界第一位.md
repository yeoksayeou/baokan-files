The Soviet Union Vigorously Develops Cultural Ties with Various Countries
	This Year, 5,000 Cultural Workers Will Visit Foreign Countries
	Currently Ranks First in the World in Publishing Translated Books

	(Dispatch from this newspaper) Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhailov published an article in "Pravda" on February 14, discussing the development of the Soviet Union's cultural ties with various countries. The summary is as follows:

	The Soviet government attaches great importance to international cultural cooperation, advocating broad cultural cooperation with all countries, regardless of their social and economic systems, and regardless of some temporary disputes and difficulties that may arise in relations between countries.

	Based on this principle and the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government is carrying out tremendous work to expand the Soviet Union's external cultural ties. Of course, our ties with the People's Democratic countries occupy a major position in this regard.

	In 1956, we signed cultural cooperation agreements with the People's Democratic countries, Syria, Belgium, Norway, and other countries. Preparations for signing agreements are also underway with other countries, especially Egypt and Lebanon. Through the Soviet Ministry of Culture system alone, more than 5,000 Soviet actors, cultural workers, and artists visited 58 countries last year. At the same time, the Soviet people also welcomed envoys from many countries of the world in their own cities.

	The Soviet Union's film exchange with foreign countries has also expanded. Sixty-one countries around the world can see Soviet films. Films from fraternal countries, as well as films from Britain, France, Argentina, Mexico, Italy, India, Egypt, Belgium, Greece, and other countries, are also shown on Soviet screens.

	The Soviet Union publishes a large number of works by foreign writers. During the Soviet era, works by more than 1,700 foreign writers have been published, with a total print run of more than 360 million copies. According to materials from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Soviet Union currently ranks first in the world in publishing translated books.

	In the Soviet Union, there are good conditions for exchanging books with various countries. Moscow has a State Foreign Literature Library, with a collection of more than 1.5 million books in 62 languages. The State Lenin Library alone conducts book and periodical exchanges with 60 countries.

	Last year, international ties among Soviet scientists also increased. The Soviet Academy of Sciences alone had about 900 scientists visit foreign countries. The number of foreign scientists who came to the Soviet Union as guests was also about the same. Our scientific organizations participate in 49 international scientific organizations, which also proves the broad international ties of Soviet scientists. In addition, Soviet educators also have extensive international ties.

	However, facts have proved that recently many countries have hastily put forward various new obstacles to hinder or even interrupt cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union. For example, U.S. President Eisenhower decided to suspend the cultural exchange program with our country (not long ago, the Washington "Star" reported on this); the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council made recommendations to its member states on reducing cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union; the British Council's committee on relations with the Soviet Union implemented a so-called "freeze" policy on cultural ties with the Soviet Union, and so on. The relevant Soviet departments signed a contract with the American "Hurok Artists" music company, deciding that the Soviet Folk Song and Dance Ensemble would perform in the United States. This matter has been postponed once and is now under the threat of not being realized, which is definitely not due to our side. In addition, only one Soviet cellist visited the United States throughout 1956, but 135 people came to the Soviet Union from the United States at our invitation.

	The Soviet Ministry of Culture has expressed its hope to exchange films with the United States on mutually beneficial terms, and to organize mutual visits of composers, musicians, and film workers. All these suggestions have been shelved due to the indifference of the United States. However, the broad masses of the American people do not support this unfriendly attitude. Many letters from the American people firmly demanding improved cultural ties with the Soviet Union are proof of this.

	Take Britain as another example. Everyone remembers how successful the Bolshoi Theatre ballet troupe's performances were in London. Many British people sincerely welcomed this performance, considering it a major event in British artistic life and a clear and solid proof of the broad possibilities of Soviet-British cultural exchange. But what happened later? With the direct participation of the British Council's committee on relations with the Soviet Union, the plan for the British ballet troupe to perform in Moscow was cancelled. Following this, the British side rejected the previously agreed-upon mutual holding of Soviet-British film weeks. Negotiations that had begun in Moscow on exchanging fine arts exhibitions were also interrupted. Other items, such as the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra's performance in Edinburgh, were also cancelled.

	Progressive intellectuals in many countries are increasingly determined to eliminate the abnormal phenomena in cultural ties caused by various reactionary groups. The Soviet Union's attitude is extremely clear: the Soviet government will do everything possible not only to maintain international cultural cooperation but also to develop this cooperation as much as possible.

	In 1957, the Soviet Union will expand its cultural cooperation with other countries, and we already have some concrete plans. We have signed cultural cooperation plans with the People's Democratic countries to further activate and comprehensively develop cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and these countries.

	We will also strive to develop cultural ties with those countries with which we have not signed cultural agreements. It can be reasonably expected that close cultural cooperation with India, Egypt, Burma, Indonesia, and other Asian and African countries will be further consolidated this year. In addition, measures will also be taken to smoothly realize ties with Western countries.

	The Soviet Ministry of Culture plans to send art troupes, individual performers, and cultural and artistic workers to more than 60 countries this year. About 5,000 actors and cultural workers will go abroad this year, and a large number of cultural workers from other countries will also be invited to the Soviet Union.

	Soviet young musicians will participate in international performer competitions in 1957, including some competitions held in Paris named after Marguerite Long, Thibaud, and Smetana. International art competitions have not been held in the Soviet Union in the past. It has now been announced that an international piano and violin competition named after Tchaikovsky will be held in 1958.

	Our films, like in the past few years, will still participate in international film festivals held in France, Italy, and other countries. The Soviet film industry will continue to seek opportunities to contact representatives of foreign film industries in the future. Film festivals to be held in the Soviet Union, regularly held foreign film festivals, and invitations to film actors and film workers from various countries to come to the Soviet Union will all promote the expansion of this contact. We will also jointly produce some feature films, scientific films, and documentary films with foreign film industries.

	Soviet scientists, composers, painters, and writers will be happy to see their foreign counterparts at their representative conferences in 1957. Soviet scientific and cultural workers advocate doing their best to expand contact between various creative organizations, and to expand contact between the Soviet Union and scientific institutions and schools in various countries through mutual visits of college students and graduate students, through the exchange of information, the holding of exhibitions, and the exchange of other materials.

	The Soviet government, as in the past, is prepared to welcome any country's proposals for establishing cultural cooperation with the Soviet Union.

### 苏联大力发展同各国的文化联系  今年将有五千名文化工作者到国外访问  目前在出版翻译书籍方面占世界第一位

    苏联大力发展同各国的文化联系
    今年将有五千名文化工作者到国外访问
    目前在出版翻译书籍方面占世界第一位
    本报讯　苏联文化部部长米哈伊洛夫2月14日在“真理报”发表一篇文章，论述苏联同各国文化联系的发展。摘要如下：
    苏联政府赋予国际文化合作以重要的意义，主张同一切国家进行广泛的文化合作，不管这些国家的社会和经济制度如何，也不管在各国之间的关系上有时会发生的一些暂时纠纷和困难。
    苏联政府根据这个原则和苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议，进行着巨大工作来扩大苏联的对外文化联系。当然，在这方面占主要地位的是我们同各人民民主国家的联系。
    1956年，我们曾同各人民民主国家、叙利亚、比利时、挪威等国签订了文化合作协定。同另外一些国家，特别是埃及、黎巴嫩，也在进行签订协定的准备工作。仅仅经过苏联文化部系统，去年就有五千多名苏联演员、文化工作者和艺术工作者到过五十八个国家。同时，苏联人也在自己的城市里欢迎过世界上许多国家的使者。
    苏联同外国的影片交换也扩大了。世界上有六十一个国家可以看到苏联影片。而在苏联的银幕上，也放映各兄弟国家的影片和英、法、阿根廷、墨西哥、意大利、印度、埃及、比利时、希腊等国的影片。
    苏联出版的外国作家的作品数量很多。在苏维埃政权时代，共出版了一千七百多位外国作家的著作，印数在三亿六千万册以上。据联合国教育科学及文化组织的材料，苏联目前在出版翻译书籍方面占世界第一位。
    在苏联，具有同各国交换书籍的良好条件。莫斯科有一个国立外文书籍图书馆，藏有六十二种文字的书籍一百五十万册以上。仅国立列宁图书馆就同六十个国家进行书刊交换工作。
    去年苏联科学家的国际联系也增加了，仅苏联科学院就有约九百位科学家到过外国。外国科学家到苏联来做客的人数，也同这个数目差不多。我国的科学团体参加有四十九种国际科学组织，这件事也证明苏联科学家广泛的国际联系。此外，苏联的教育工作者也有广泛的国际联系。
    但是事实证明，近来许多国家都匆忙提出各种新的障碍，来阻碍甚至中断同苏联的文化交流工作。如美国总统艾森豪威尔先生曾决定中止同我国的文化交流计划（不久以前华盛顿的“明星报”曾报道过这件事）；北大西洋公约组织理事会曾向各会员国提出关于缩减同苏联的文化交流工作的建议；英国文化委员会对苏关系委员会实行了所谓“冻结”对苏文化联系的政策等等。苏联的有关部门曾同美国“尤罗克艺术家”音乐公司签订了一项合同，决定苏联民间歌舞团到美国去演出。这件事已经延期了一次，现在又处在不能成行的威胁中，这决不是由于我们这方面的缘故。此外，在1956年全年只有一位苏联大提琴演奏者到过美国，但应我国邀请从美国到苏联来的有一百三十五人。
    苏联文化部曾表示希望在互利的条件下同美国交换影片，组织作曲家、音乐家、电影工作者的互相访问。所有这些建议都由于美国方面的漠视而被搁置下来了。但是美国广大群众并不拥护这种不友好的态度。美国人民寄来的许多坚决要求改善同苏联的文化联系的信件便是证明。
    再以英国为例。大家都记得大剧院芭蕾舞剧团在伦敦的演出是多么成功。很多英国人都衷心欢迎这次演出，认为这是英国艺术生活中的重大事件，认为是苏英两国文化交流具有广泛可能性的鲜明而确凿的证据。但是，后来又怎样了呢？在英国文化委员会对苏关系委员会的直接参加下，取消了英国芭蕾舞剧团到莫斯科来演出的计划。继之英国方面拒绝了早已规定好的苏英双方互相举办电影周的事。在莫斯科开始的关于交换举办造型艺术展览会的谈判也中断了。其他关于列宁格勒交响乐队到爱丁堡去演出等项也都取消了。
    许多国家的进步的知识分子，日益坚决地力图消除由各种反动集团所造成的文化联系方面的不正常现象。苏联的态度是极清楚不过的：苏联政府将尽一切力量不仅要保持国际文化合作，而且还要尽量发展这种合作。
    1957年苏联要扩大同其他国家的文化合作，而且我们已有了一些具体计划。我们已经同各人民民主国家签订了文化合作计划，以进一步活跃和全面发展苏联同这些国家之间的文化合作。
    同那些和我们未签订文化协定的国家，我们也要尽力发展文化联系。可以有根据预料，今年同印度、埃及、缅甸、印度尼西亚和亚非其他国家的紧密的文化合作，会更进一步巩固起来。此外也要采取措施以顺利实现同西方各国的联系。
    苏联文化部计划今年要派艺术团体、个别表演者和文化艺术工作者到六十多个国家去。今年一年之间，约有五千名演员和文化工作者要到国外去，同时也邀请了其他国家的大量文化工作者到苏联来。
    苏联的青年音乐家在1957年将参加国际演奏者的比赛，其中包括在巴黎举行的以玛格丽特·朗、蒂伯和斯麦塔那等人为名的一些比赛会。过去在苏联没有举行过国际性的艺术比赛。现在已经宣布，在1958年要举行以柴可夫斯基命名的国际钢琴家和小提琴家的比赛。
    我们的电影也要同过去几年一样，仍将参加在法国、意大利和其他国家举行的国际电影节。苏联电影界今后仍要寻求同外国电影界代表接触的机会。预定要在苏联举行的电影节、经常举办的外国电影节以及邀请各国电影演员和电影工作者到苏联来，都将促进这种接触的扩大。我们还要同外国电影界共同摄制一些艺术片、科学片和文献纪录片。
    苏联科学家、作曲家、画家和作家们，在1957年自己的代表会议上将高兴地看到外国的同行。苏联的科学工作者和文化工作者主张尽力扩大各创作组织之间的接触，通过大学生、研究生的互相访问，通过交换情报、举办展览会和交换其他材料来尽力扩大苏联同各国科学机关和学校的接触。
    苏联政府同过去一样，准备欢迎任何国家关于同苏联建立文化合作的建议。
