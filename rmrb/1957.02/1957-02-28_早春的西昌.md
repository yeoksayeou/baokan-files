    In mid-February, snowflakes and willow catkins were dancing together in Xichang City. Spring comes so early to this city, located on the edge of the subtropics, that newcomers can't tell whether it's spring or winter.
    Bright green cacti grow on the earthen walls, and the residents, as usual, use pine needles to start fires for cooking. The fragrance of the smoke permeates the city all day, like incense. Daisies, dianthus, and pansies have already bloomed. Around the Lantern Festival, the sky is clear at night, and the moonlight is so bright that you can read newspapers and books.
    You can often see some Yi youths wearing "tsarwas" (capes) on the streets, leisurely playing the moon guitar as they walk. These former slaves, liberated during the democratic reforms of last autumn and winter, come from Liangshan and other places hundreds of miles away. They sell honey and medicinal herbs, and buy sickles, plows, iron pots, and cloth. Quemu Dong, from Butuo County, received free farm tools from the People's Government during the democratic reforms and settled down. Now he has brought some wild animal skins to sell and bought a few pounds of wool to take back.
    In the suburbs, spring plowing has already begun. Farmers are leveling rice paddies, and in some places, they have already begun sowing rice seeds. The Xi-Qiong Canal irrigation project, which began last winter, is nearing completion and will irrigate more than 26,000 mu of land with water drawn from Qiong Lake.
    On holidays, pleasure boats ply the shimmering blue waves of Qiong Lake, which surrounds more than sixty miles, between Xichang City and the scenic Lushan area. The peach blossoms on the banks of Qiong Lake had already bloomed in January. The rapeseed in the fields has already formed pods, and the wheat has plumped. Often for a whole morning, a belt of thin mist surrounds the verdant foot of Lushan Mountain where it meets the water, and flocks of ducks splash on the surface. (Attached picture)

    早春的西昌
    新华社记者　程在华
    2月中旬的西昌城，雪花和柳絮一同飞舞着。这座地处亚热带边沿的城市的春天来得这样早，以致使初来的人莫辨春冬了。
    土墙上生长着翠绿的仙人掌，居民们和往常一样用松针叶生火做饭，它的烟味芬芳，使城内整天浸在檀香似的气味里。雏菊、石竹花、蝴蝶花早已开放。在农历元宵节前后，晚上碧空无云，月光皎洁，可以看清书报。
    你常常可以在街头发见一些披着“擦尔瓦”（披风）的彝族青年，他们悠然自得地怀抱月琴边弹边走。这些在去年秋冬之间民主改革时才解放出来的过去的奴隶，来自百里外的凉山等地。他们出卖蜂蜜和药材，选购镰刀、犁头、铁锅和布匹。来自布拖县的却木冬在民主改革中领到人民政府的无偿农具，并且安了家。现在他带来一些野兽皮卖掉后，买了几斤羊毛回去。
    在城郊，春耕已开始。农民们正在平整秧田，有的地方已开始撒播稻种。去冬动工的西邛渠水利工程已近尾声，曾引“邛海”的水灌溉两万六千多亩田地。
    一到假日，在那周围六十多里的邛海的鳞鳞碧波上，游船来往荡漾在西昌城和风景区泸山之间。邛海畔的桃花在1月间已绽开。田野的油菜已结荚，小麦已饱籽。往往有一整个上午，青葱的泸山脚下和水相连的地方围起了薄雾的带子，成群的水鸭扑打在水面上。（附图片）
