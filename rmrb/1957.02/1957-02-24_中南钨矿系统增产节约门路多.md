The Central South Tungsten Mine System Has Many Ways to Increase Production and Practice Economy

    (Our dispatch) In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, do the various tungsten mines still have potential to tap? The Central South Tungsten Mining Bureau used the method of detailed accounting and found a definite answer.

    In the past, the Central South Tungsten Mining Bureau had difficulty completing its cost plans. From January to September of last year, the overall cost overrun reached 1.91 million yuan. Since the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, workers and staff members of various factories and mines under the Bureau have responded to the Party's call to increase production and practice economy, promote advanced experiences, utilize waste materials and old materials, and find substitute materials, prompting more than ten enterprises to complete their cost and profit plans. Some workers and leaders believe that "the campaign to increase production and practice economy last year has exhausted all the potential and found all the tricks, and there is no more major benefit this year."

    In response to this situation, the Central South Tungsten Mining Bureau proved through detailed accounting that there is great potential and many tricks to be found in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the tungsten mine system. Based on the shortcomings of tungsten mine production, the focus is on finding ways to increase production and practice economy in mining, beneficiation, machinery and power, as well as the use and consumption of equipment and materials. In terms of beneficiation, if enterprises throughout the Bureau that did not reach the planned targets in 1956 can strive to reach the planned targets, they can increase production by 4.38 million yuan. If, on this basis, the actual recovery rate is further increased by 1%, production can be increased by 4 million yuan. In terms of mining, improving quality is the biggest form of economy. There is even greater potential in machinery and power. If the power equipment of various mines throughout the Bureau is adjusted for load, staggered power consumption is implemented, peak loads are reduced, and the load factor is increased by 10%, the potential of 910 kilowatts can be tapped, and if the power factor is increased by 0.15, the potential of 1,600 kilowatts can be tapped. These two items alone are equivalent to adding more than 30 diesel engine generators with 74 horsepower. In terms of utilizing waste materials and old materials and using substitute materials, if all mines implement the use of heavy diesel oil for low-speed diesel engines and a 50/50 mixture of light and heavy diesel oil for medium-speed diesel engines to replace the previous use of all light diesel oil, 3 million yuan can be saved annually. If the waste engine oil from diesel engines and air compressors in various mines is not discarded but is recycled, filtered, and reused, more than 400,000 yuan can be saved annually. In addition, strengthening the recovery and utilization of pit props, using pine and miscellaneous wood instead of fir pit props, using bamboo instead of pit props, using bamboo pipes instead of steel pipes, using hardwood with iron skin instead of temporary rails, and using turpentine or coke instead of diesel as fuel in furnaces, etc., can all save funds and ease the tense situation of material supply.

### 中南钨矿系统增产节约门路多

    中南钨矿系统增产节约门路多
    本报讯　在增产节约运动中，各钨矿究竟还有没有潜力可挖？中南钨矿局运用算细账的办法，找到了肯定的答案。
    中南钨矿局在历年来，都难以完成成本计划。去年一至三季度全局成本超支达一百九十一万元。自党的八届二中全会以后，全局所属各厂矿职工纷纷响应党的增产节约的号召，推广先进经验，利用废料、旧料，寻找代用材料，促使十多个企业完成了成本和利润计划。有些职工和领导人员就认为“去年开展的增产节约运动，已经把潜力挖尽，窍门找光，今年没有什么大油水了”。
    针对这一情况，中南钨矿局经过算细账证明，钨矿系统中开展增产节约运动，潜力是很大的，窍门也是很多的。根据钨矿生产的缺点，主要是在采矿、选矿、机械动力以及设备材料的使用和消耗方面寻找增产节约的途径。在选矿方面，如全局各矿在1956年中没有达到计划指标的企业都能争取达到计划指标，即可增产四百三十八万元。如在此基础上再提高实收回率1％，即可增产四百万元。在采矿方面如能提高质量，就是最大的节约。机械动力方面的潜力更大。全局各矿动力设备经调整负荷、实行交叉用电、压低高峰负荷，提高负荷率10％，可挖掘九百一十瓩的潜力，提高功率因素零点一五，即可挖掘一千六百瓩的潜力。仅以这两项计算，即相当于增加三十多部七十四马力的柴油引擎发电机。在利用废料旧料和使用代用材料方面，各矿如都实行低速柴油机使用重质柴油、中速柴油机使用轻、重质柴油各掺合一半来代替过去全部使用轻质柴油，一年即可节约三百万元。各矿柴油机、压风机的废机油如不弃置，经回收过滤利用，一年可节约四十万元以上。另外，如加强坑木回收和利用，以松坑木和杂木代替杉坑木，以竹子代替坑木，以竹管代替钢管，以硬质木加铁皮代替临时性的铁轨，以松节油或焦炭代替柴油作炉中燃料等等，都可节约资金，缓和材料供应紧张的局面。
