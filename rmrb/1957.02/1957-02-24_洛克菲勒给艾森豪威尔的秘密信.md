Editor's Note:

"Neues Deutschland" published on the 15th a reliable text of a secret letter written by Nelson A. Rockefeller, heir to the largest oil trust in the United States, Mobil Oil Corporation, to U.S. President Eisenhower in January 1956. In this letter, the billionaire offered advice to the U.S. President on establishing American dominance over the world. An abstract of this letter appeared on page six of this newspaper on the 18th. We now publish the full letter as follows:

Dear Mr. President:

I am unwilling to return to the lengthy discussion we had at Camp David regarding my proposal to adopt a bolder plan to aid underdeveloped countries. However, recent political developments indicate that our discussions were not without fruit, and now is the time for me to explain some of my ideas, which, while not claiming originality, may be of some help in dealing with one of the most important issues in our foreign policy.

First, I would like to express my deep satisfaction with the new bill to increase aid to underdeveloped countries. If I am not mistaken, this bill was approved by you after Eden's visit to Washington. The bill is very timely, especially in light of Ambassador Cooper's recent report. This report emphasizes the dramatic decline in the United States' prestige in India, particularly after Dulles made comments that Portugal should retain Goa.

I regret to have to point out that my advocacy for expanding our economic measures has been misunderstood. I do not now, and never have had, any fundamental disagreements with the government regarding the general direction of our foreign policy. I value the importance of military alliances as much as anyone, but I believe that such alliances need to be approached with a different attitude than the State Department has taken thus far. We should not close our eyes to the fact that military alliances are becoming increasingly unpopular due to the aggressive diplomatic offensive launched by the Russians.

We must face the fact that the policy of establishing military alliances has suffered serious setbacks in the past two or three years. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) may be an example. The major countries of Asia have refused to join this organization.

The fate of our recent military plans is even worse. I am referring to the Baghdad Pact, which Dulles considers an important victory for American diplomacy – Britain claims it as its victory.

True, on paper and on the map, the Baghdad Pact seems not bad. It unites four Middle Eastern countries into a single military alliance favorable to us. These countries are located on the southern edge of the communist world and provide valuable reserves of strategic raw materials and manpower.

However, one of these four countries, Turkey, is already linked to our defense system through NATO, and another country, Pakistan, is a member of SEATO. However, most Arab countries have not joined this treaty, believing that it is inherently contrary to their national interests. Establishing these alliances has not, in fact, achieved the goals we hoped to achieve in Southeast Asia or the Middle East, because we have not been able to draw into the treaty or organization those countries whose participation is necessary for success. I do not say this to imply that these organizations are useless to us or that they should not have been established at all. My criticism is of the methods used to establish these groups. I am reluctant to use the famous paraphrase: "What is good for Mobil Oil is good for America," but I still cannot ignore the fact that neither the Baghdad Pact nor SEATO has guaranteed our access to the valuable resources of the relevant regions. Moreover, they have not even guaranteed the security of these potentially important bridgeheads.

In light of the visits of the leaders of the Russian Communist Party to India, Burma, and Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union's willingness to engage in large-scale economic cooperation in the region, the failure of our post-war Asian policy is even more apparent. These Russian actions may have far-reaching economic and political implications for the future of all Asian countries, but, regrettably, we have so far failed to counter these actions in any effective way. Therefore, if we are to not only consolidate existing military alliances and arrangements but also establish new military alliances and arrangements – assuming that such treaties are the appropriate form of relationship with other countries – then we must begin to act in accordance with the new circumstances we face.

The discussion at Camp David that led to my resignation concerned less the substance of our current relations with less developed countries, or the theoretical principles of our policy in underdeveloped regions, than the method of implementing that policy. I mention this dispute because some of my arguments have apparently had a favorable impact on, and been helpful to, your approval of the bill to increase aid to less developed countries. It is for this reason that I want to reiterate in this letter my views on what I believe are some necessary changes in our Asian policy.

To put it simply, our policy must be both "global" and "total"; "global" means including every part of the world, and "total" means including political, psychological, economic, military, and special methods, combining these methods into a whole. In other words, we must harness all our horses in one team. To better illustrate my point, I would like to make an analysis – even a superficial one – of certain aspects of the foreign policies we are implementing in Europe and Asia.

In Europe, we started with economic aid. It is very possible that without the Marshall Plan, we would have found it much more difficult to organize NATO. In fact, what happened in this case was that a unified foreign policy using all pressures led to the establishment of what we hoped would be a consolidated military alliance. Even critics within NATO itself say that its weakness is an overemphasis on the military aspect and a neglect of the economic factors that played a significant role in the organization's formation.

In Asia, our efforts have been far less successful. I believe that the main reason for this can be clearly explained: the concept of force is too blatant, with too much emphasis on the military aspect; and we have greatly neglected the importance of the economic groundwork for the alliances we hope to form. Due to the State Department's underestimation of the important economic aspects, SEATO and the Baghdad Pact are built on sand. I would very much like to see the sand solidify. The American tradition is "trade first, then the flag," but despite this wise tradition, all our forces are used to build the military aspect of SEATO. But it is hard to imagine that SEATO member states would be willing to join Chiang Kai-shek, supported by the United States, in a war against Communist China. But this is clearly the State Department's calculation.

I admit that I am very pleased to see that an increasing number of people in the government are gradually coming to the conclusion that ill-considered military steps can sometimes weaken, or even completely undermine, the effectiveness of economic measures, the necessity of which Your Excellency has already begun to see. But if economic aid paves the way for these military measures, the same military measures often seem unobjectionable.

Mr. President, you are of course aware that in the vast underdeveloped regions of the world, the most serious problems are the lack of funds, equipment, management talent, and technical expertise. We must keep this fact in mind at all times when formulating any plans. If we believe in military arrangements, we should be willing to pay the price for them.

But the "payment" must be made in a different way than before. Thus, for example, although economic and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries amounted to more than ten billion dollars last year, in fact, more than half of this amount was concentrated in three countries, and in these three countries, the decisive factors were military and political considerations rather than economic considerations. These countries are South Korea, Taiwan, and South Vietnam. I am pleased to see that the government is finally no longer – so to speak – straddling the wall of military alliances, helplessly watching the development of nationalism among the Asian peoples who are simultaneously accepting American armaments and Russian technical assistance. I am pleased to see that the government, albeit under the influence of external factors, is finally giving due attention to the economic aspects of our military alliances, recognizing that economic policy is inseparable from military policy.

In fact, one of the most meaningful examples that can illustrate my opinion is the experiment conducted in Iran, which, as you will recall, I was directly involved in. By utilizing economic aid, we were finally able to obtain Iranian oil, and our economic position in that country is now quite solid. The strengthening of our economic position in Iran has enabled us to control its entire foreign policy, and in particular, to make it participate in the Baghdad Pact. Currently, King Shah dares not even change his cabinet without consulting our ambassador.

In summary, the various considerations discussed here have led my friends and myself to the conclusion that our political plans must be based on the following fundamental considerations:

(1) We must continue to take measures aimed at creating and strengthening our military alliances, because these alliances can consolidate our entire position in Asia and the Middle East, and may also help to deter any communist aggression and prevent the outbreak of nationalism.

We should not ignore the important fact that virtually all of our natural rubber, manganese, chromium, tin, a large portion of our zinc, copper, oil, and a third or more of our required lead and aluminum come from abroad, and this is mainly from the underdeveloped regions of Africa and Asia. These regions all fall within the scope of this or that military alliance established by the United States. The situation is similar for a large portion of our "super strategic materials" (especially uranium ore).

(2) In order to strengthen, and if possible, expand these alliances, we must formulate a broad economic development plan, broad enough to ensure that we maintain a political and military influence in Asia, Africa, and other underdeveloped regions that is as great or greater than what we achieved in Europe through the Marshall Plan. The main portion of the economic funds we allocate to underdeveloped countries should be channeled through institutions established to serve our military alliances, for this very reason. In this way, these military alliances themselves will become more attractive. Certain formal changes in these alliances should be considered if necessary.

In other words, wherever possible, we should emphasize the economic aspects of our alliances. We should widely and wisely use economic aid to countries we want to ally with us. But we must be more flexible and careful than before. In the past, we sometimes linked the provision of economic aid to the requirement that they participate in this or that alliance of ours, in a very crude way, which alienated many potential allies from us. Our actions must be cautious and patient, and in the initial stages, must be limited to seeking minimal political concessions in exchange for our economic assistance (in some special cases, even without any concessions in return), so that at a later stage, we can step up the proposal of political costs and military demands.

Your agreement to give Egypt economic aid to help it build the Aswan Dam seems to be based on these considerations. If the Nasser government accepts this aid, it will create a situation where Egypt will inevitably be trapped in an excessively large project, thereby requiring our long-term support. I think it is logical to extend this cooperation to other countries. And in particular, do not forget the theory on which this cooperation is based, that the raising of political demands is cumulative rather than immediate.

(3) Therefore, I suggest that the countries to which the United States will provide economic aid should be divided into three categories, and different methods and forms of economic cooperation should be adopted for each category of country.

First, we should select those countries that have friendly anti-communist governments and that are already linked to the United States through stable, long-term military agreements. In these countries, government subsidies and loans can mainly take the form of military appropriations. Because fish that are already hooked don't need bait. In this regard, I agree with the State Department that extensive economic aid appropriations, such as those to Turkey, may in some cases have the opposite effect of the original intention, that is, they may strengthen its tendency to independence and weaken its existing military alliance. Direct economic assistance can also be given to these countries, but the assistance we give them should only be as much as is necessary to enable the relevant appropriate government to continue in power and to contain any hostile opposition.

In this regard, it is also necessary to control private investment. The government should utilize and encourage private investors, because there are many political goals that can be achieved with their help. In the long run, this private investment should enable us to eliminate or offset any disloyal opposition or forces resisting our policies, and to increase economic pressure on any local business groups that have not yet definitively indicated whether they will support us or are hesitant to do so. At the same time, economic assistance to those sectors of the local business community that are willing to cooperate with the United States should be strengthened, and the necessary conditions should be created for such business people to be placed in important economic positions, thereby strengthening their political influence.

The second category of countries includes those that pursue or tend to pursue neutral policies. In this category, as far as government subsidies and loans are concerned, the emphasis of economic assistance should be on creating a condition under which the economic relations we establish will eventually lead these countries to naturally join the military treaties and alliances we initiate. The essence of this policy should be that the development of our economic relations with these countries will eventually enable us to occupy an important position in the local economy. In neutral countries, we should support any tendency to undertake large-scale economic projects that exceed what is truly feasible, seeking our help (such as the aforementioned situation in Egypt). In this way, we can hope to steer the foreign policies of these countries in a more desirable direction.

When encouraging private investment in these countries, those parts or individuals that oppose the current regime should be supported. In this way, we can lay the foundation for shifting these countries' policies in a healthier direction.

The most important of these second-category countries is of course India.

The third category of countries should include those colonial countries that are still directly dependent on their suzerain states (such as Morocco, the Belgian Congo, Equatorial Africa, etc.). While taking measures aimed at encouraging private investment in these countries, we should also, under specific circumstances and to an appropriate extent, support local business people who are engaged in the struggle against colonial status. In the initial stages, this assistance can take the form of establishing joint ventures. When supporting these elements, we should start from the fact that if we do not support them, we will lose all hope of exerting a restraining influence on them, until we discover that it is too late. If this happens, the desire for independence may eventually become such strong nationalism that not only the old colonial powers cannot control it, but we cannot control it either.

When providing extensive economic assistance to all three categories of countries, it should always be presented as America's sincere and selfless willingness to help and cooperate with them. We must not be stingy in clearly explaining the selfless nature of the United States' policy of assisting underdeveloped countries, using all the propaganda means at our disposal. We are not stingy in conducting anti-communist work.

At the same time, our investors, our technical experts, and other experts should penetrate every sector of the national economies of underdeveloped countries, develop these sectors with due consideration for our own interests, encourage the national aspirations of those business people in the local area whose political loyalty is beyond doubt, and treat these tasks as their mission.

In my opinion, as long as all these suggestions can be implemented, the result will not only strengthen the overall international position of the United States, but will also strengthen the existing military arrangements and give them new vitality, thereby greatly facilitating the completion of any military tasks we may face in the future.

I believe you will sympathize with the views explained here, and I hope these views can help us formulate policies along the right lines; otherwise, I would not have written this letter, and I certainly would not have written it so long.

Of course, in this letter, I cannot write down all my arguments about the need to change the focus of our foreign policy. However, I believe that you, and those responsible for drafting the budget, can now be convinced that we do need to take measures to strengthen our position in Asia and the Middle East (this may be more important), and have decided to change the order of priorities that we previously maintained regarding different aspects of this central issue. As my friends say, we cannot let future historians say: in the second decade after World War II, freedom throughout the world was lost because the United States budget had to be balanced.

Respectfully,
Nelson A. Rockefeller

### 洛克菲勒给艾森豪威尔的秘密信

    洛克菲勒给艾森豪威尔的秘密信
    编者按：
    “新德意志报”15日刊载了美国最大的石油托辣斯美孚油公司的继承人纳尔逊·阿·洛克菲勒在1956年1月写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封秘密信的可靠文本。这位亿万富翁在这封信中，为了建立美国对全世界的统治向美国总统献策，这封信的摘要，已见18日本报第六版。现再将全信刊载如下：
    亲爱的总统先生：
    我不愿意回复到在戴维营就我提出的关于采取一种比较大胆的援助不发达国家的计划的建议所进行的冗长的讨论上来。但是最近的政治局势表明，我们的讨论并不是没有收获的，现在是我应当说明我的一些想法的时候了，虽然这些想法并不自居是独创之见，但是在处理我们外交政策的最重要的问题之一方面，也许有一些帮助。
    首先我愿意表示我对于增加给不发达国家的援助的新法案深感满意。如果我没有错的话，这个法案是在艾登访问了华盛顿以后得到你的同意的。这个法案是很适时的，特别是根据库柏大使最近的报告来看是这样。这个报告强调了美国在印度的威信剧烈下降，特别是在杜勒斯发表了葡萄牙应当保有果阿的言论以后。
    我遗憾地不得不指出，我主张扩大我们经济措施的意见是被误解了。在关于我们外交政策的总路线方面，我现在没有，并且从来也没有同政府有过任何基本的分歧。我像任何人一样重视军事同盟的重要意义，但是我相信这种同盟需要采取一种同国务院迄今所采取的不同的态度。我们不应当闭起眼睛不正视这样一个事实：由于俄国人发动的积极的外交政策攻势，军事同盟现在正在越来越不得人心。
    我们必须正视这样一个事实：在过去两三年中，建立军事同盟的政策遭到了严重的挫折。东南亚条约组织也许就是一个例子。亚洲的主要国家都拒绝参加这个组织。
    我们最近的军事计划的命运甚至更坏。我指的是巴格达条约，杜勒斯认为巴格达条约是美国外交取得的重要胜利——英国自称是它的胜利。
    不错，在纸面上和地图上，巴格达条约看起来似乎不坏。它把四个中东国家联合成一个对我们有好感的单一的军事同盟。这些国家位于共产主义世界的南部边缘，并且提供战略原料和人力的可贵的后备。
    然而，这四个国家之一土耳其已经通过北大西洋公约组织同我们的防务体系联系在一起，另一个国家巴基斯坦是东南亚条约组织的一个成员国。可是，大多数阿拉伯国家却没有参加这个条约，它们认为这个条约从其本质上来说是违反它们的民族利益的。建立这些同盟事实上并没有达到我们在东南亚或者在中东所希望达到的目的，因为我们没有能够把那些要取得成功就必要有它们参加的国家拉入这个条约或这个组织之中。我这样说，并不是说这些组织对于我们是没有用的，根本不应当建立这些组织。我批评的不是这些条约，而是建立这些集团所采用的方法。我不愿意使用这句有名的释意语：“对美孚油公司是好的，对美国也是好的”，但是我仍然不能忽视这个事实：无论是巴格达条约还是东南亚条约都没有保证我们可以使用有关地区的有价值的资源。而且，它们甚至没有保证这些可能的重要桥头阵地的安全。
    鉴于俄国共产党领袖们对印度、缅甸和阿富汗的访问和苏联表示愿意在这个地区进行大规模的经济合作，更显出了我们战后亚洲政策的失败。俄国这些行动可能对所有亚洲国家的前途具有深远的经济的和政治的影响，但是，说来很遗憾，我们迄今一直没有以任何有效的方法来对付这些行动。因此，如果我们不仅要巩固现有的军事同盟和安排，而且还要建立新的军事同盟和安排——姑且认为这种条约是我们同其他国家的关系的合宜的形式，那么我们就必须开始按照我们所面临的新的情况行事。
    在戴维营结束的、导致我的辞职的那次讨论与其说关系到我们目前同不大发达国家间的关系的实质，或者与其说关系到我们在落后地区的政策的理论原则，不如说关系到实行那种政策的方法。我所以提到这次争论，是因为我的某些论点显然对于你批准对不大发达国家增加援助的那个法案产生了有利的影响和有所帮助。正是因为这一点，我再次要在这封信里提出我对于我认为我们的亚洲政策中的一些必需的改变的意见。
    说得简单扼要一点，我们的政策必须既是“全球的”又是“总体的”；所谓“全球的”是指要包括全世界每一个部分，所谓“总体的”是指要包括政治、心理、经济、军事和特别的方法，而把这些方法结合为一个整体。换句话说，要把我们所有的马匹都拴成一队。为了更好地说明我的观点，我想对我们在欧洲和亚洲执行的外交政策的某些方面作一番分析——即令这是一种肤浅的分析。
    在欧洲，我们是以经济援助开始的。十分可能，如果没有马歇尔计划，我们会发现在组织北大西洋公约组织时要困难得多。事实上在这个情况下所发生的是，一项使用一切压力的统一的外交政策造成了我们希望是一种巩固的军事同盟的建立。连北大西洋公约组织本身内部的批评者也说，它的缺点是过分地强调军事方面，而忽视了在成立这个组织时起了很大作用的经济因素。
    在亚洲，我们的努力远没有这样成功。我相信，可以清楚地说明这种情况的主要原因：武力的概念太露骨，过于着重军事方面；而我们大大忽视了我们希望成立的那些同盟在经济方面的先期准备工作的重要性。由于国务院对重要的经济方面估计不足，造成了东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约建立在散沙上。我很希望看到散沙凝结起来。美国的传统是“先贸易而后军旗”，尽管有这种聪明的传统，我们的一切力量却用于建立东南亚条约组织的军事方面。但是，很难想像，东南亚条约成员国会愿意同美国支持下的蒋介石一起卷入一场跟共产党中国进行的战争。但是这显然是国务院的盘算。
    我承认我很高兴地看到，政府中越来越多的人在逐渐得出这样的结论：考虑不周的军事步骤有时会削弱、甚至完全破坏经济措施的效果，而经济措施的必要性阁下自己已经开始看到。但是如果用经济援助替这些军事措施铺平道路，同样的军事措施就常常使人觉得是无可非议的。
    先生，你当然知道，在世界上广大的不发达地区，最严重的问题是缺乏资金、装备、管理人才和技术专门人才。我们在拟订一切计划时必须时刻都把这个事实考虑进去。如果我们相信军事安排，我们应该愿意为它们付出代价。
    可是必须要用同以前不同的方式“付款”。因此，举例说，虽然去年给予不发达国家的经济和技术援助达到十亿美元以上，事实上，这笔款子约有半数以上集中在三个国家，而在这三个国家中，决定性的因素是军事和政治考虑而不是经济考虑。这些国家是南朝鲜、台湾和南越。我很高兴看到政府终于不再——可以这样说——骑在军事同盟的墙头上，无能为力地观望着同时接受美国的军备和俄国的技术援助的亚洲各国人民当中民族主义的发展。我高兴地看到，政府虽然是在外来因素的影响下终于还是给予我们的军事同盟的经济方面以适当注意，认识到经济政策是同军事政策分不开的。
    实际上，能够说明我的意见的一个最意味深长的例子是在伊朗进行的试验，你当记得，我同这个试验是直接有关的。由于利用了经济援助，我们终于能够取得伊朗石油，并且我们现在在这个国家的经济中地位已经相当巩固。我们在伊朗的经济地位的加强使我们能够控制它的整个外交政策，并且特别是使它参加了巴格达条约。目前，国王沙阿未经征求我们的大使的意见甚至不敢更动一下他的内阁。
    总括来说，这里所谈到的种种考虑使我的朋友和我本人得出这样的结论：我们的政治计划必须根据如下的基本考虑：
    （一）我们必须继续采取目的在于创立和加强我们的军事同盟的措施，因为这些同盟能够巩固我们在亚洲和中东的整个地位，同时还可能有助于阻止任何共产党侵略和防止民族主义的爆发。
    我们不应该忽视这个重要的事实：实际上我们全部的天然橡胶、锰、铬、锡，我们很大部分的锌、铜、石油，以及我们所需的三分之一或者还多一些的铅和铝是从国外来的，而且，这主要是从非洲和亚洲的不发达地区来的。这些地区都属于美国所建立的这个或那个军事同盟的范围。我们的“超级战略物资”（特别是铀矿）的很大一部分的情况也是这样。
    （二）为了加强，如果可能的话，而且扩大这些同盟，我们必须制订一个广泛的经济发展计划，其广泛的程度足使我们在亚洲、非洲和其他不发达地区保有一种比我们通过马歇尔计划在欧洲所获得的一样大或者更大的政治和军事影响。我们分配给不发达国家的经济款项主要部分所以应该通过为我们的军事同盟服务而设立的机构，就是为了这个缘故。这样一来，就会使得这些军事同盟本身更加吸引人。如果必要的话，应当考虑这些同盟的形式上的某些改变。
    换句话说，凡是可能的地方，我们都应该强调我们的同盟的经济方面。我们应该广泛地和明智地利用给予那些我们希望它们同我们结盟的国家的经济援助。但是我们必须比以前做得更加灵活和小心。在过去，有时我们把经济援助的规定同要它们参加我们这个或者那个同盟的要求联系起来，而方式又非常粗暴，结果使许多可能的盟国同我们疏远起来。我们的行动必须谨慎耐心，而在最初阶段，必须限于谋取起码的政治上的让步作为我们经济援助的交换（在某些特殊情况下，甚至不需要任何让步作为回报），这样，在稍后的一个阶段，我们就能够加紧提出政治上的代价和军事上的要求了。
    你同意给埃及以经济援助，帮助它修建阿斯旺水坝，似乎是根据这些考虑的。如果纳赛尔政府接受这个援助，那就会造成这种情况，埃及将必定陷于过分庞大的工程上，从而长期需要我们的支持。我认为，把这种合作扩大到其他国家是合乎逻辑的。而尤其是不要忘记这种合作所依据的理论，即政治要求的提出是积累的而不是只顾当前。
    （三）因此我建议，应该把美国将要给予经济援助的那些国家分成三类，对于每一类国家采取不同的经济合作的方法和形式。
    首先，我们应该选出那些有着同我们友好的反共政府的国家，它们已经通过稳定的、长期的军事协定同美国联系在一起。在这一类国家中，政府的补助和贷款主要可以采取军事拨款形式。因为已经上钩的鱼儿用不着诱饵。在这方面，我同意国务院的意见，那就是广泛的经济援助拨款，例如对土耳其的拨款可能在某种情况下造成同原来的意图恰恰相反的结果，那就是可能加强它的要独立和削弱它的现有的军事同盟的倾向。对这些国家，同样可以予以直接的经济援助，但是我们给他们的援助只能是为了使有关的合适政府继续执政并遏制任何敌对的反对派而必要的那么多。
    在这方面，还必需控制私人投资。政府应该利用并鼓励私人投资家，因为有许多政治目的可以在他们的帮助下达到。从长远说来，这种私人投资应该使我们能够消除或者抵消任何不忠实的反对派或者抗拒我们政策的势力，并对任何还没有肯定表示是否要支持我们或对此表示犹豫的当地企业集团加强经济压力。同时对当地企业界中那些愿意同美国合作的阶层的经济援助应该加强，应该为这样的企业界人士创造必要的条件，以便把他们安置到重要的经济岗位上去，从而加强他们的政治影响。
    第二类国家包括那些奉行或倾向于奉行中立政策的国家。在这一类中，就政府补助和贷款而论，经济援助的重点应该是创造一种条件，在这种条件下，我们建立的经济关系最后会使这些国家自然而然地加入我们发起的军事条约和同盟。这种政策的实质应该是：我们同这些国家的经济关系的发展，最后会使我们能够在当地经济中占据重要的地位。在中立国家，我们应该支持任何要想取得我们的帮助着手进行超过真正切实可行的大规模经济计划的倾向（例如，上述埃及那样的情况）。通过这种办法，我们可以希望使这些国家的外交政策转向比较合乎希望的方向。
    在鼓励对这些国家进行私人投资时，应该支持那些反对现政权的部分或者个人。这样，我们就能为使这些国家的政策转到比较健康的方向打好基础。
    这第二类国家中最重要的一个当然就是印度。
    第三类国家应该包括现在仍旧直接依附于宗主国的那些殖民地国家（例如摩洛哥，比属刚果，赤道非洲等等。）在采取目的在于鼓励对这些国家进行私人投资的措施的同时，还应该在特定的情况下，在适当的限度内，支持当地正在进行反对殖民地地位的斗争的企业界人士。在最初阶段，这种援助可以采取建立联合企业的形式。在支持这些分子的时候，我们应该从下面这样一个事实出发，那就是：要是我们不支持他们，我们就会失去对它们发生抑制的影响的一切希望，等到发觉已经太迟了。如果发生这种情况，要求独立的愿望最后就可能会变成十分强烈的民族主义，以致于不仅老殖民国家不能控制，而且我们也不能控制。
    在对所有这三类国家提供广泛的经济援助的时候，应该永远表现为美国真诚而大公无私地愿意帮助它们和同它们合作。在利用我们所掌握的一切宣传手段明白交代美国援助不发达国家的政策的大公无私的性质方面，我们绝不能吝啬。我们在进行反共工作方面就是毫不吝啬的。
    同时，我们的投资者，我们的技术专家和其他专家应该深入落后国家国民经济的每一个部门，在适当考虑到我们自己的利益的情况下发展这些部门，鼓励当地政治上的忠心毫无疑问的那些企业界人士的民族抱负，并且把这些工作当作他们的任务。
    在我看来，只要所有这些建议能够贯彻实行，结果就不仅会加强美国的整个国际地位，而且也会加强现有的军事安排并且赋予新的生命力，从而也会大大便利将来我们可能会面临的任何军事任务的完成。
    我相信你是会同情这里所说明的意见的，我也希望这些意见能够帮助我们按照正确的方针制定政策；要不是这样，我就不会写这封信，而且我肯定也不会写得这样长。
    当然，在这封信中我不能够把我关于应该改变我们外交政策的重点的全部论点全都写下来。然而，我相信，你，还有负责起草预算的那些人，现在能够相信我们确是需要采取措施加强我们在亚洲和中东（这也许更加重要）的地位，并且已经决定改变以前对这个中心问题的不同方面所保持的轻重缓急的次序。正像我的朋友们所说的，我们不能让将来的历史学家说：在第二次世界大战后第二个十年中，全世界的自由都由于美国预算要保持平衡而丧失殆尽了。
      纳尔逊·阿·洛克菲勒谨上。
