    Workers Still Wearing Military Uniforms
    By our reporter Gu Lei
    In the Qaidam Basin, how many moving things have happened in the past two years? It is impossible to count them all. Last year, when wind and snow attacked the basin, when I met those comrades wearing faded yellow military uniforms, I couldn't help but think of a song written by a comrade:
    Wind and sand, don't be arrogant,
    Haven't you seen my faded green military uniform?
    Qaidam is welcoming us for the first time,
    Encountering wind and sand is by no means the first time.
    We have climbed countless mountains,
    Crossed the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Yalu River,
    We have camped in blizzards more than once,
    Gunfire and bullets couldn't stop us either.
    In today's Qaidam Basin,
    I and my friend – the big Gis truck,
    Want to sing proudly and freely,
    Ignoring the howling of the wind and sand!
    In the song, a heart of an industrial builder, newly transferred from the army, is beating happily. It's not just one person's heart beating; in various work positions in the basin, I have met many transferred soldiers, and I saw this on their faces. Whenever I met them, I always asked how they were working and living. This wasn't because I doubted their will to overcome difficulties, but just wanted to know about their transition process from combat life to industrial construction. This is not a small matter. For most of the comrades who were soldiers, giving up the shooting technique of "three points in a line" and learning drilling technology is a 180-degree turn. I once asked these new soldiers on the industrial front if they had encountered difficulties in learning the technology, and the answer I received was very simple: "At first, of course, it was very difficult, but we were determined to learn, and as a result, we learned it!" That's what 25-year-old Wang Shengmin, whom I met in Youquanzi, told me.
    Youquanzi is in the western part of the basin and is the first spark rising in the quiet basin. In the winter of the year before last, a test well here first sent good news. The workers used drill bits to engrave unforgettable words on the earth: There is great hope for oil in the Qaidam Basin.
    When I went to Youquanzi, eleven wells were already flowing with crude oil. This is the largest exploration area in the basin, with as many as five 3,200-meter large drilling rigs, three of which are lined up in a row, standing tall on a profile. The drilling tower is 45 meters high, with red flags waving on top. The workers on the wells are busy working. They are wearing cotton work clothes, hard hats like steel helmets, and are covered in mud, and some of them are still wearing military uniforms. The diesel engine roared, and the slender drill rods were quickly rotated in the air by steel cables. The oil storage structure in Youquanzi is exceptionally wide, at least twenty times larger than the Laojunmiao oil storage structure in Yumen. Originally, there was no grass, no tree, no water, no house, no person here. Since oil was discovered here and flowed endlessly like a spring, it became lively and acquired its current name. It was in this exploration area that I met Wang Shengmin.
    Last year, Wang Shengmin just passed the exam to become a Grade 7 driller.
    "What is the highest grade for a driller?" I asked Wang Shengmin as soon as he sat down.
    "Grade 8," he replied with a smile.
    "Oh! When did you transfer from the army?"
    "Autumn of 1952," he always said with a smile.
    "Your technology is very high, almost like a top marksman in the army."
    "Far from it! Drilling is a very profound subject!"
    This is true. The person operating the drilling rig stands on the ground, holding the drill handle, and cannot see the drill bit turning hundreds of meters underground. He must judge whether the underground drilling is normal through the shaking of the drill handle, just like a doctor taking a pulse. In this way, he must not only have the ability to prevent possible failures early but also have the technology to quickly eliminate various accidents. This requires skilled techniques, as well as carefulness, boldness, alertness, and decisiveness. Drilling work is a collective labor, and if one is careless during the shift, the achievements of other shifts will be ruined, and even the entire drilling results will be scrapped.
    Wang Shengmin, together with all the comrades of the entire division, was transferred to the petroleum industry department in 1952. At that time, he was a deputy squad leader in the company. When he heard that he was going to learn technology, he was a little scared, feeling that someone who had only attended primary school could not learn technology. He thought: "It's better to go to resist US aggression and aid Korea!" Later, when he heard that the country lacked oil and needed oil exploration personnel, he had no objections. At that time, the company was very considerate of the soldiers' difficulties and organized everyone to study culture intensively. In more than a month, Wang Shengmin learned more than 2,300 new characters, and he entered the technical school with this achievement.
    Things didn't go smoothly. At first, Wang Shengmin felt that technical theory seemed superfluous.
    "There are many kinds of stones, there are granular rocks, sandstones..." the teacher said.
    "What is it, a stone is a stone, what is the use of dividing it into rocks!" Wang Shengmin always couldn't figure it out while sitting in the classroom.
    "Everyone, take a look, this is sandstone," the teacher said, holding up a specimen.
    "It's clearly a coarse stone, how can it be called sandstone!" Wang Shengmin couldn't figure it out even more.
    In fact, this was only a part of the technical course. Internal combustion engines, electric welding, drilling knowledge... all were things he had never heard of before. At that time, the school was located in a row of cave dwellings in Zaoyuan, Yan'an. In winter, the cave dwellings were very cold. There were no beds, so everyone spread wheat straw on the ground and slept on the straw. Discussion meetings and note-taking were all done in the straw nests. The ink froze, so it was warmed in the sleeve, and the pen was stretched in to dip water. When their hands froze, they warmed them by breathing on them. They didn't take these difficulties in life to heart, all they thought about was how to remember everything the teachers taught, but they couldn't always get what they wanted. Once, the teacher talked about sandstone containing minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and mica. Everyone discussed it, and it seemed not difficult to remember, but a few days later, when Wang Shengmin answered questions in class, he said it was coal, steel, and oil! The courses in the school were arranged very tightly. Sometimes everyone discussed a problem until late at night, sleeping only two or three hours a day, and their heads were still like cast iron, unable to fill anything in.
    After eight months of hard work day and night, Wang Shengmin graduated and was assigned to the Yanchang Oil Mine as a drilling worker with many comrades. When he took a look, he was scared enough again! Looking around, he didn't know how the drill bit drilled into the ground.
    "Master, how does this drill bit drill down?" Wang Shengmin asked the old master.
    "Can't you see it moving up there?" the old master asked back.
    "What work do I do?" Wang Shengmin asked again.
    "There's plenty of work, watch and do it!" the old master said impatiently.
    It seemed that the old master was unwilling to teach. This is not surprising. An old technical worker had to be very careful and spend a long time learning his skills in the old society. Although it is now a new society, if the old master doesn't meet an apprentice who can study diligently and practice hard, he is unwilling to teach patiently. Wang Shengmin didn't understand this, and thinking that everything should be fought for, he and everyone else criticized the old master at a meeting. This struggle didn't work out and ended in a "dud." The old master simply ignored them.
    "What do we do?" Wang Shengmin discussed with the people who came with him. After studying this and that, they found a good way: to exchange hearts.
    From that day on, the old master found his socks missing when he returned to the dormitory. The next day, they were washed clean and returned; every few days, he found that someone had taken apart and washed his quilt; when he got up in the morning and picked up his shirt, someone had washed it again. These things were all done by Wang Shengmin and his companions. They bought soap, sacrificed their sleep time, and helped the old master with his work. Sometimes, as soon as the old master got up, the water for washing his face was ready, and as soon as he was about to go to bed at night, the water for washing his feet was ready. When the old master was working, they did whatever he asked, not afraid of being tired or dirty. Over time, they figured out the old master's temper. As soon as the old master turned his head, they knew what he wanted and immediately handed it over. From then on, the old master told everyone, "These young people are promising and can become good drillers." So he carefully taught his skills to his apprentice. Not long after, Wang Shengmin could hold the drill. The first time he went into battle, he panicked and was always afraid to give pressure, fearing an accident. At this time, the old master stood by and shouted, "Give it some strength! Hey, hey, that's right! Give it some more, good!" After another eight months, Wang Shengmin was promoted to deputy driller.
    After Wang Shengmin learned to hold the drill, he took a direct route from Yanchang to Yumen and was promoted to a Grade 5 driller in June 1955. During this period, he participated in the drilling of eleven wells, nine of which saw oil. He was very happy every time he saw oil, feeling that he had done his part in developing the petroleum industry. At this time, the Qaidam Basin attracted him again. Especially when he saw the drilling teams from Yumen going to Qaidam one after another, he asked the leaders to go to the basin. Soon, this wish came true. He packed his bags and went to say goodbye to his lover.
    "I heard that life there is very hard, are you still going?" his lover asked.
    "I have to go, I'm a member of the Communist Youth League! If I don't go, who will! Besides, can we wait for others to build it well before we go to enjoy the benefits?" Wang Shengmin asked back.
    "What about me?"
    "Live in Jiuquan first, if you don't want to, go back to your old home in northern Shaanxi first. When there are houses in the basin, I'll go home to pick you up, okay?"
    When he arrived in Youquanzi, Wang Shengmin worked on the large drilling rig, so happy that he couldn't close his mouth, like a soldier getting a good gun. He continued to work hard to learn the technology and passed the Grade 7 driller exam in June last year. In July, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.
    "You must not be proud. I am intensively studying culture, determined to pass the Grade 8 driller exam in 1957!" Wang Shengmin told me when we parted.
    One day, I finally left Youquanzi by car with reluctance, saying goodbye to the tall drilling towers and the people here! On the way, I could never forget Wang Shengmin, with his ochre face, medium height, and plump and solid muscles. Especially when I saw batches of newly transferred military comrades arriving in the basin in Mangai and Lenghu. In fact, at this time, I was not only thinking of him personally, but also thinking of our army, the soldiers who grew up in our army, who are fearless in doing any kind of work at any time. I believe that in the development of China's petroleum industry, people will certainly not forget them, just as they cannot forget the army that defends this cause in the cause of socialist construction.

    还穿着军服的工人	本报记者　顾雷
    在柴达木盆地里，两年多来，发生了多少动人的事情？这是永远数不完的。去年，当风雪侵袭盆地的时候，当我遇见那些身穿褪了色的黄军衣的同志们的时候，不由得想起了一位同志作的一支歌：
    风沙，莫要狂妄，
    你没有看见我的褪色的绿军装？
    柴达木是第一次迎接我们，
    遇见风沙绝不是第一场。
    我们爬过数不清的大山，
    渡过长江、黄河、鸭绿江，
    暴风雪里不止露过一次营，
    枪林弹雨也没能把我们阻挡。
    在今日的柴达木盆地，
    我和我的朋友——大吉斯车，
    要高傲、自由地歌唱，
    管你什么风沙的呼啸声！
    歌声中，有一颗刚由军队转业的工业建设者的心在愉快地跳动。这不是一个人的心在跳动，在盆地中的各个工作岗位上，我遇见过许多个转业的军人，从他们的脸上我看到了这点。每逢遇到他们，我总是要打听他们工作、生活得怎样，这并不是对他们战胜困难的意志有什么怀疑，只是想知道他们由战斗生活转向工业建设的过程。这不是一件小事情。对于多数是战士的同志们说来，丢掉“三点成一线”的射击要领，学习钻探技术，转的是一百八十度的弯子。我曾问过这些工业战线上的新战士，他们在学习技术时有没有遇到过困难，得到的回答非常简单：“开始，当然是很困难的，我们决心学，结果就学会了！”我在油泉子遇见的二十五岁的王胜民，他也是这样告诉我的。
    油泉子在盆地的西部，是沉静的盆地里升起的第一颗火花。前年冬天，这里的一口探井，首先发出喜讯，工人们用钻头在大地上刻下了不可磨灭的字句：柴达木盆地石油大有希望。
    我到油泉子去的时候，这里已经有十一口井流出原油。这是盆地最大的一个探区，只是三千二百公尺的大钻机就有五部，其中的三部一字儿排开，挺立在一个剖面上。钻塔高四十五公尺，顶上有红旗招展。井上的工人们正忙着工作。他们穿着棉工作服，头顶戴着钢盔一样的铁帽子，身上溅满了泥浆，其中有些人身上还穿着军衣。柴油机轰鸣着，瘦长的大钻杆被钢索吊在空中飞快地转动。油泉子这个储油构造异常宽阔，至少比玉门的老君庙储油构造大二十倍以上。原来这里无一片草、一棵树、一汪水、一间房、一个人，自从在这里发现了石油，而且犹如泉水一样永流不息，这里才变得热闹了，而且有了现在这个名字。我就是在这个探区里遇见王胜民的。
    去年王胜民刚考上七级司钻。
    “司钻技术最高的是几级？”王胜民刚坐下，我就问他。
    “八级。”他笑着答。
    “嗬！你是什么时候转业的？”
    “1952年秋天。”他每说一句，总是笑着。
    “你的技术很高了，和部队上的特等射手差不多。”
    “还差得远呢！钻探这门学问可深呢！”
    这倒是真话。操纵钻机的人，站在地面上扶着钻把子，看不见钻头在几百公尺的地下转动的情况。他，要像医生试脉那样通过钻把子的颤抖，判断地下钻进是否正常；这样，他不但要有及早防止可能发生故障的本领，并且要有迅速排除各种事故的技术，这需要有熟练的技巧，也需要心细、胆大、机警、果敢。钻井工作，是集体的劳动，万一在值班的时候不小心，就会把其他班的成就葬送掉，甚至使整个钻探成绩报废。
    王胜民，是1952年同全师的同志一起，转业到石油工业部门的，当时是连队里的一个副班长。他听说要学技术，心里有些害怕，觉着一个只上过初级小学的人，无法学习技术，心想：“还不如抗美援朝去哩！”后来，听说国家缺少石油，需要石油勘探人员，自己也就没有什么意见了。当时，连队里很能体谅战士们的难处，组织大家突击学文化。在一个多月的时间里，王胜民认识了两千三百多个生字，他就带着这个成绩进了技术学校。
    事情并不很顺利，开始王胜民觉得技术理论似乎是多余的。
    “石头，有很多种，有粒岩、沙岩……”教员讲道。
    “什么玩意，石头就是石头，分什么岩有什么用处呢！”王胜民坐在课堂上，心里总是想不通。
    “大家看看，这就是沙岩。”教员举起一块标本说。
    “明明是粗石头，怎么叫沙岩呢！”王胜民愈想不通了。
    其实，这只是技术课中的一部分，什么内燃机、电焊、钻井常识……全都是过去没有听说过的。那时，学校设在延安枣园的一排窑洞里。冬天，窑洞里冷得很。没有床，大家把麦草铺在地上，睡在草上面。开讨论会，抄笔记，都坐在草窝里。墨水冻了，放在袖筒里暖着，把钢笔伸进去沾水。手冻僵了，放在嘴上哈几口气。他们，没有把生活上的这些困难放在眼里，所想的是如何把教员讲的课都记住，但是总不能如愿。有次，教员讲沙岩里含有石英、长石、云母等矿物，大家也讨论了，似乎不难记住，可是，过不几天，王胜民在课堂上答问时，却说成是煤、钢铁、石油了！学校里的课程安排的很紧，有时大家为了一个问题讨论到深夜，每天只睡两三个小时的觉，而脑袋仍然像铁铸的，一点东西都填不进去。
    经过八个月艰苦的日日夜夜，王胜民毕业了，同许多同志一起被分配到延长油矿当钻探工人。一看，又吓得够呛！看来看去，不知钻头是怎样钻到地下去的。
    “师父，这钻头怎样钻下去的？”王胜民问老师傅。
    “看不见它上边动吗？”老师傅反问道。
    “我干啥活呢？”王胜民又问。
    “活有的是，看着干吧！”老师傅不耐烦地说。
    看样子，老师傅不愿意教。这是难怪的，一个老技术工人，在旧社会学本事，岁月要长不说，还要陪多少小心。虽说现在是新社会了，如果老师傅遇不到能够勤学苦练的徒弟，便不愿意耐心地教，王胜民刚到，谁知道这个小伙子是不是热爱钻机呢？王胜民不理解这点，一想，凡事要斗争，便和大伙一起，在一次会上向老师傅提出了批评。这一斗争不要紧，打了个“哑火”，老师傅根本不理。
    “咱们怎么办？”王胜民同一起来的人商量。研究来，研究去，找到了一条好办法：以心换心。
    从这一天起，老师傅回到宿舍里，发现袜子丢了，第二天谁给洗的干干净净的送了回来；隔不两天，下班回来，发现被谁也给拆洗了；早晨起床，拿起衬衣，又是谁给洗了呢。这些事情都是王胜民一伙人干的，他们买肥皂，牺牲睡觉的时间，帮助老师傅干活。有时，老师傅刚起床，洗脸水到了，晚上刚要上床，洗脚水到了。老师傅工作时，叫他们干什么就干什么，不怕累、不怕脏。天长日久，摸清了老师傅的脾气，只要老师傅一回头，就知道他要什么，马上就递过去。从此，老师傅逢人便讲：“这帮年青人有出息，能成为一个好钻工。”于是细心地把技术教给了徒弟。过了不久，王胜民就会扶钻了。第一次上阵，心慌，总是不敢给压力，生怕出事故。这时，老师父站在一旁叫唤：“给点劲！嗳，嗳，对了！再给点，好了！”又是八个月的时间，王胜民被提升为副司钻。
    王胜民学会扶钻以后，从延长到玉门，走着一条直路，1955年6月便被提升为五级钻工。在这个期间里，他参加了十一口井的钻井工作，其中有九口井见了油。每次看到油，他都非常高兴，觉得在发展石油工业时他也尽了一份力量。这时，柴达木盆地又吸引了他，特别当他看到玉门的钻井队，一个一个走向柴达木的时候，便向领导上提出到盆地的要求。不久，这个愿望实现了。他收拾行装，去向爱人辞行。
    “听说那里生活很苦，你还去？”爱人问道。
    “那也得去，青年团员么！我不去谁去！再说，咱们还能等着别人建设好了，去享福？”王胜民反问了一句。
    “我呢？”
    “先在酒泉住，要不愿意，先回陕北老家去，等盆地里有房子，我回家接你，行不行？”
    到了油泉子，王胜民在大钻机上工作，乐的合不上嘴，像战士得到一条好枪。他继续努力地学习技术，去年6月间考上了七级司钻，7月间光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    “万不能骄傲，我正在突击学文化，决心在1957年考上八级司钻呢！”我们分手时，王胜民告诉我说。
    一天，我终于带着惜别的心情，坐汽车离开了油泉子，向高大的钻塔、向这里的人们告别了！路上，我总是忘不了赭色的面孔、中等身材、肌肉丰满而结实的王胜民，特别当我在芒崖、冷湖，看到一批又一批新转业的军人同志到了盆地的时候。其实，这时我不只是想到他个人，而是想到我们的军队、在我们军队中成长的战士，他们在任何时候，干任何一种工作都是无畏的。我相信，在我国石油事业的发展中，人们一定不会忘记他们的，正像在社会主义建设事业中忘记不了保卫这一事业的军队一样。
