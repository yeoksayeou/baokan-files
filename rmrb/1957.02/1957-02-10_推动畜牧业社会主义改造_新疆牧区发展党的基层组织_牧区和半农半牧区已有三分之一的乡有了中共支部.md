    Promoting the Socialist Transformation of Animal Husbandry
    Developing Party Grassroots Organizations in Xinjiang's Pastoral Areas
    One-third of Townships in Pastoral and Semi-agricultural/Semi-pastoral Areas Now Have CCP Branches
    (Our Newspaper News) In the process of socialist transformation of animal husbandry, Party organizations at all levels in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have universally attached importance to developing Party members and establishing Party organizations. As of the end of September 1956, 1,426 new Party members had been recruited from among working herdsmen in pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas, and branches had been established in one-third of the pastoral and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral townships.

    The quality of the new Party members is basically good. The vast majority are outstanding elements with a clear history, from poor backgrounds, who wholeheartedly support the Party, and who have shown active performance in various work and socialist transformation of animal husbandry over the years. The development of Party organizations has powerfully promoted current work. When the Nuoyabao Pastoral Cooperative of Jimunai County was established last spring, new Party members Naifugan, Zhashou Bayi, and Mu Hashetai went from house to house to carry out propaganda, explaining to the masses the benefits of unified management of livestock through shareholding, and took the lead in contributing their livestock as shares. Within a few days, thirty-six cooperative members contributed all their livestock to the cooperative. When the lambs were being delivered in the spring, the weather was very cold, and Party members Mu Hashetai and Zhashou Bayi mobilized the cooperative members to put three hundred sheep in felt houses to deliver the lambs, so that the lamb survival rate reached 98%. Most of the newly established branches and groups have played a leading role in pastoral (agricultural) production, enabling most cooperatives and groups to over fulfill this year's pastoral and agricultural production plans and increase the income of cooperative members and group members.

    Party committees at all levels attach great importance to Party building work in pastoral areas. At the organizational work conference in April and the pastoral area work conference in May last year, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee inspected and deployed the Party building work in pastoral areas, and criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking in Party building in pastoral areas. Party committees in various places have successively made plans for Party building in pastoral areas and sent a group of cadres to carry out this work. Before March last year, Jimunai County did not pay enough attention to Party building work, and only recruited eight Party members in pastoral areas. In early April, the County Party Committee convened an enlarged meeting to inspect and criticize the idea that "pastoral areas are special" and "herdsmen are backward," and did not pay attention to Party building work. It organized three Party building work groups to go to various districts to carry out Party building in conjunction with cooperative establishment and other work. In the second and third quarters, forty-four Party members were developed. Habuhe County arranged Party building work at the same time as arranging cooperative establishment work, and extracted eighteen Party member cadres from county-level organs to go to various districts to carry out Party building. As a result, 116 new Party members were developed in the county in the first half of the year.

    Before developing Party members, all localities generally carefully selected activists. The production and residence of herdsmen are scattered and have great mobility. In response to these characteristics, most adopted the method of decentralized mobile education to educate activists. Wherever the activists live and produce, the Party building cadres go there to conduct education, and after educating in one place, they go to another place. While educating and examining activists, all localities also paid attention to publicizing the significance and purpose of Party building to upper-level figures through individual or small-scale symposiums to dispel their concerns.

    推动畜牧业社会主义改造
    新疆牧区发展党的基层组织
    牧区和半农半牧区已有三分之一的乡有了中共支部
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各级党组织在畜牧业社会主义改造过程中，普遍地重视发展党员，建立党的组织。截至1956年9月底，已在牧业和半农半牧区的劳动牧民中接收了一千四百二十六名新党员，在三分之一的牧业和半农半牧乡建立了支部。
    新党员的质量基本上是好的。绝大部分是历史清楚、出身贫苦、衷心拥护党、在历年来的各项工作和畜牧业社会主义改造中表现积极的优秀分子。党组织的发展有力地推动了当前工作。吉木乃县诺亚堡牧业社新党员乃甫干、扎首巴衣、木哈什太等在去春建社时，挨家逐户的进行宣传，向群众说明牲畜入股统一经营的好处，带头把牲畜入股。几天之内三十六户社员把牲畜全部入了社。春天接羔的时候，天气很冷，党员木哈什太和扎首巴衣动员社员将三百只羊放在毡房子里接羔，使羊羔成活率达到98％。新建的支部和小组大多数在牧（农）业生产中起了领导作用，使大部分社、组都超额完成了今年牧农业生产计划，增加了社员、组员的收入。
    各级党委对牧区建党工作都很重视。新疆维吾尔自治区党委在去年4月组织工作会议和5月牧区工作会议上对牧区建党工作进行了检查和布置，批判了牧区建党方面的右倾保守思想。各地党委先后作出了牧区建党的计划，派出一批干部来进行这一项工作。吉木乃县去年3月以前对建党工作不够重视，在牧区中只接收了八名党员，4月初，县委召开了扩大会议检查和批判了认为“牧区特殊”“牧民落后”而不重视建党工作的思想，组织了三个建党工作组，分赴各区结合建社等工作进行建党，二、三两个季度便发展了四十四名党员。哈巴河县在布置建社工作的同时布置了建党工作，并且在县级机关中抽出十八名党员干部，分赴各区进行建党，因而上半年全县发展了一百一十六名新党员。
    各地在发展党员之前，一般都认真的挑选了积极分子。牧民的生产和居住分散，流动性大，针对着这些特点，大都采取分片流动教育的方法教育积极分子，积极分子住到那里，到那里生产，建党干部就到那里进行教育，这一个地方教育了再到另一个地方去。在教育考察积极分子的同时，各地还注意通过个别的或者小型座谈会的方式向上层人士宣传了建党的意义和目的，解除他们的顾虑。　　（孙元璋）
