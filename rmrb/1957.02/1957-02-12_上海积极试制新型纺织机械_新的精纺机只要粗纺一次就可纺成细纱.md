Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th. Shanghai's two largest textile machinery factories are currently designing and trial-producing four new types of textile machinery, and plan to trial-produce six types within the year.

The new large drafting spinning frame designed by the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory has already been put into production. The spinning frame originally produced by this factory could only spin the roving fourteen to twenty-two times longer, which required the cotton sliver to be roved twice before it could be spun into fine yarn. The new large drafting spinning frame can spin the roving thirty-six to forty-two times longer, requiring only one roving process to spin into fine yarn. If a new cotton spinning mill with 100,000 spindles adopts this large drafting spinning frame, it can use 100 fewer roving frames and 3,500 square meters less construction area, saving more than 500,000 yuan in basic construction investment.

This factory has also decided to trial-produce three types of silk spinning machines this year. Among them, the twisting machine has been designed and will be trial-manufactured within the month. The design of the doubling machine is in progress. Another fully automated silk reeling machine is actively collecting data and preparing for design and trial production. According to the designers, the silk spinning machines that this factory plans to produce are part of the new silk textile machines that China is starting to produce this year. Once these machines are produced, they will gradually change the production landscape of China's silk industry.

The China Textile Machinery Factory, the country's largest producer of automatic looms, will introduce its first new product this year: an automatic towel loom. The design work for this machine was completed at the end of January, and it is expected that two units can be trial-produced in May. The new products included in this factory's trial production plan this year also include a multi-shuttle box loom suitable for weaving multi-colored plaid fabrics and a wool weaving machine.

    上海积极试制新型纺织机械
    新的精纺机只要粗纺一次就可纺成细纱
    新华社上海8日电　上海两个规模最大的纺织机械厂，目前正在设计和试制四种新的纺织机械，年内准备试制六种。
    国营上海第二纺织机械厂新设计的大牵伸精纺机已经投料生产。这个厂原来生产的精纺机只能把粗纱纺长十四倍到二十二倍，这样就需要把棉条粗纺两次才能精纺成细纱；新的大牵伸精纺机可以把粗纱纺长三十六倍到四十二倍以上，只需粗纺一次就可以纺成细纱。新建一个十万纱锭的棉纺厂采用这种大牵伸精纺机，可以少用一百台粗纺机和三千五百平方公尺的建筑面积，共可节约五十多万元基本建设投资。
    这个厂还决定今年试制三种丝纺机。其中，拈丝机已经设计完成，月内就要开始试造；并丝机的设计工作正在进行。另一种完全自动化的缫丝机，正在搜集资料，积极准备设计和试制。据设计人员说，这个厂准备生产的纺丝机，是我国今年开始生产的新型丝纺织机的一部分，这些机械生产出来，将逐步改变我国丝绸工业的生产面貌。
    国内最大的生产自动织布机的中国纺织机械厂，今年的第一种新产品是自动织毛巾机。这种机器的设计工作已经在1月底结束，预计5月份可以试制出两台。这个厂列入今年试制计划的新产品还有适合织多种颜色格子布的多梭箱织机和毛织机。
