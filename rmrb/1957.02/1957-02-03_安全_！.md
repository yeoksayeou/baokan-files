    "Security"!
    In Washington, the word "security" is truly used in wondrous ways. For years, the United States has been waving the banner of so-called "collective security," dragging Britain and France along to carry out this or that aggressive plan. However, the United States recently announced that in the Middle East, Britain and France are useless and detrimental to American "security." According to Dulles, if American troops "go to war in the Middle East, I would rather not have French and British troops on either side; I think I would feel much safer."
    However, Dulles immediately realized that this was a bit too disrespectful to his two "little buddies," so he quickly had State Department press officer White come out to explain that Dulles "did not mean to insult the British and French forces," and that they are still "allies of great importance" to the United States.
    The United States' tactics of alternating between blows and caresses are very clear. On the one hand, the United States is eager to seize the opportunity of Britain and France's failure to invade Egypt to squeeze them out of the Middle East. This requires kicking Britain and France hard so that they will obediently follow American arrangements. On the other hand, the United States' entire aggressive plan still needs the help of Britain and France. For example, in aggressive organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty and the Southeast Asia Treaty, it needs Britain and France to continue to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. Therefore, it takes a turn and gives Britain and France a bit of gentle reassurance.
    This kind of flexible approach by the United States is indeed more "secure" for its policy of monopolizing the Middle East, but it is difficult to say what the effect on the "security" of Britain and France will be. Not only are the interests of Britain and France in the Middle East being seized, but they also have to put on a smiling face and say it's a good thing. And once the United States causes trouble, Britain and France will inevitably suffer as innocent bystanders. Some of the more clear-headed people in Britain and France not only see that they have suffered losses, but also feel insulted by the United States. Therefore, Labor MP Davis once proposed a retaliatory motion in the British Parliament, demanding the immediate withdrawal of American troops stationed in the United Kingdom. He pointed out: "The Eisenhower Doctrine increases the risk of Britain being attacked by atomic weapons." Conservative MP Pilkington also shouted loudly in Parliament: "Shouldn't we feel much safer in this country if Mr. Dulles were not around?" This is the helpless and indignant emotion of the British ruling class, but it reveals the fact that the US-UK "alliance" is an unequal relationship.

### “安全”！

    “安全”！
    “安全”这个字眼，在华盛顿真是妙用无穷。好些年来，美国一直是打着所谓“共同安全”的招牌，拉着英法一道去进行这样那样的侵略计划的；可是，美国最近忽又宣布，在中东这个地区，英法两国却是一种不利于美国“安全”的废物了。据杜勒斯说：如果美国军队“到中东去作战，我宁愿左右没有法国兵和英国兵，这样我想我会觉得安全得多”。
    但是，杜勒斯立刻就发觉，这未免对自己的两个“小伙计”太不留面子了，于是他又赶紧叫国务院新闻发布官怀特出来解释说，杜勒斯“并没有污辱英法部队的意思”，而且它们还是受到美国“极大的重视的盟军”。
    美国这样一打一拉，用意是非常明显的。一方面，美国急于要利用英法侵略埃及失败的机会，把英法挤出中东，这就需要把英法狠狠地踢几脚，以便整得它们规规矩矩地听从美国的摆布。但另一方面，美国的整个侵略计划到底还是少不了英法帮忙的，例如在北大西洋公约、东南亚条约等侵略组织中，它就需要英法继续给美国火中取栗，因此，它又转一个弯，给英法一点好言抚慰。
    美国这种随机应变的手段，对于它独占中东的侵略政策，确实是比较“安全”的，可是，对英法两国的“安全”却就很难说了。英法两国在中东的利益被抢走不算，还得陪着笑脸说抢得好，并且一旦美国撞出祸来，英法也免不了要受池鱼之殃。英、法某些头脑比较清楚的人不但看到吃了亏，也感到受了美国的污辱。因此，工党议员戴维斯曾经在英国议会中提出一个报复性动议，要求驻在英国境内的美军立即撤退。他指出：“艾森豪威尔主义增加了英国遭受原子武器攻击的危险”。保守党议员皮尔金顿也在议会里大声喊道：“如果杜勒斯先生不在我们的身边，我们不应当感到这个国家更安全得多吗？”这是英国统治集团莫可奈何的激愤情绪，却道出了美英“同盟”是不平等关系的事实。
