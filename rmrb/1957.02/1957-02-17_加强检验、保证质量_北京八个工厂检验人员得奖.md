Xinhua News Agency, 16th. Beijing's eight state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private light industry factories' inspection and laboratory personnel have recently received rewards and commendations for their outstanding achievements in ensuring and improving product quality in a parallel business competition.

Last quarter, the inspection and laboratory personnel of thirty-four light industrial factories in Beijing launched a parallel business competition. As a result, the product quality of these factories has improved to varying degrees. The quality of Snow Lotus paper produced by the Yanjing Paper Mill has reached the first-class level in the country. The percentage of Golden Star Gold Pen Factory's pen nibs that are smooth on all four sides has reached over 98%.

During the competition, the inspection and laboratory personnel not only adhered to the principle of being responsible to consumers and strictly controlled product quality, but also frequently went deep into the workshops to conduct patrol inspections of semi-finished products and quality inspections and tests of raw materials, helping workers reduce defective products.

    加强检验、保证质量
    北京八个工厂检验人员得奖
    据新华社16日讯　北京市八个国营、地方国营、公私合营轻工业工厂的检验、化验人员，因为在保证提高产品质量方面成绩显著，最近得到同业务竞赛的奖励和表扬。
    北京市三十四个轻工业工厂检验、化验人员去年第四季度展开了同业务竞赛。这些工厂的产品质量因而都有不同程度的提高。燕京造纸厂雪连纸质量已经达到全国第一流水平。金星金笔厂笔尖四面都光滑的已经达到98％以上。
    在竞赛中，检验、化验人员不但坚持对消费者负责的原则，对产品质量进行严格控制，同时也经常深入车间，以巡回检查半成品、进行原材料质量的检查和化验等方法，帮助工人减少废次品。
