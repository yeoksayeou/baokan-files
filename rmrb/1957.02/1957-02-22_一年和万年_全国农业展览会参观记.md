One Year and Ten Thousand Years
    ——A Visit to the National Agricultural Exhibition
  　Our Reporter　Yan Ling
    The Recent Year
    What lovely smiles, what familiar smiles! These laughing faces, a year ago, I had seen in the Henan countryside at the celebration of the establishment of advanced cooperatives, and in the farmer reporting teams on the streets of Beijing. Now, I see them again in the large photos on the east wall of the comprehensive hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition. Farmers smile and crowd around the table at the enrollment office for the cooperatives, farmers smile and raise huge bright red double happiness signs as they walk through the streets of many cities, farmers smile as they hand over the letter of determination to resolutely take the socialist road—the good news letter of completing the complete socialist agricultural cooperation of the whole township and district—to Chairman Mao. That is a laughter free from all worries, a laughter full of infinite hope, a laughter full of confidence from people who have taken control of their own destiny.

    The farmers, with such laughter, plunged into the fiery struggle of production. A set of photos brings people's thoughts back to the winter and spring of a year ago….

    The laughter and hope have not failed, the enthusiastic labor has not been in vain. In this year, just one year, how much has the Chinese people advanced on the agricultural front? Come here and review it! The army of numbers is neatly arranged, looking spiritedly and paying attention to you! Don't dislike these many teams for looking too boring, but compare and analyze them more! You must know that it was not easy for these armies and squads of numbers to get to this place. How much sweat have farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen shed for them, how much effort have workers put in for them, how many commercial workers have run around for them, how much have science and technology workers spent thinking for them, how many grassroots cadres and leaders have spent sleepless nights for them….

    We must not forget that in our vast rural areas, pastures, and fishing boats, there are hardly any machines—even if there are a few machines, they are insignificant.

    We must not forget that in 1956, nature seemed to deliberately test the Chinese people's will and strength to take the socialist road, and inflicted so many disasters on us—how many places suffered from typhoons, floods, droughts, and other torments.

    The cooperative system withstood a major test. Although a few people once again showed hesitation and wavering in some disturbances, the army of socialist agriculture marched forward more vigorously and more neatly. Look, each of its arms and detachments holds up dazzling achievement markers: Grain, the total output in 1956 was 368.59 billion catties, an increase of about 20 billion catties compared with 1955; Cotton, the total output in 1956 was about 30.5 million dan, roughly the same as in 1955 when there were fewer disasters; Major oil crops, the total output in 1956 was 294.22 million dan; Afforestation, the newly planted area in 1956 was 10.31 million hectares (in 1950 it was only 127,000 hectares);….

   How is the life of the farmers? You don't have to doubt how much reality the small farmhouse model arranged in the exhibition can represent. You can go to the non-disaster areas in the countryside to see, there are naturally some that are not as good as this farmhouse, and there are also some that are stronger than this farmhouse. Let's look at a few more numbers: In 1956, except for the disaster areas, about 80% of the agricultural cooperatives increased their income. In this year, the total consumption of cotton cloth in rural areas was 113.78 million bolts (in 1952 it was 86.93 million bolts, in 1949 it was 45.26 million bolts), and the total consumption of sugar in rural areas was 465,000 tons (in 1952 it was 253,000 tons, in 1949 it was 73,000 tons)….

    Who can say that the increase in sweetness in the heart is not directly proportional to the increase in sugar consumption?

    This year, what a year worth remembering in the years to come and boasting to future generations!

    The Past Ten Thousand Years
    “We are doing extremely glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors have never done before.” In the water conservancy hall of the agricultural exhibition, these words of Comrade Mao Zedong are written. Of course, this sentence does not only refer to water conservancy undertakings, nor does it only refer to agriculture. However, at the National Agricultural Exhibition, people will particularly easily feel the power of this sentence and appreciate the meaning of this sentence.

    This sentence does not mean to look down on our ancestors in any way, but only to show that our generation has not disappointed the hard work and expectations of our great ancestors for millions of years. We have inherited and carried forward all the excellent things created by our predecessors, washing away and abandoning all the unreasonable things left over from history, so that the human and material resources hidden in our great motherland have obtained unprecedentedly favorable conditions, shining brightly on the earth and on the sea.

    Look, that dark red stone, that is the plow used by our ancestors; that gray-blue stone, that is the sickle used by our ancestors. Here are also a few pictures: naked people, only wearing animal skins around their waists, are laboriously hunting and herding in the wilderness, plowing and reclaiming wasteland in the mountains and fields. Text description: This is the situation of production and life of people in our primitive society from about 10,000 to 2,000 years BC. Gradually, people learned to use oxen to pull plows and learned to plant more grains. On the oracle bones left over from the Shang Dynasty more than 1,000 years BC, people can see the original shapes of the characters "millet," "wheat," "grain," "plow," and "lei," and can also see the records of the weather. Gradually, people learned to use ironware, and the power to conquer nature was greatly strengthened. Look, those are the five kinds of grains unearthed from the ancient Han Dynasty tombs in Luoyang; that bird, holding a flower in its mouth and standing on top of a pole, is the "weather vane" of the Han Dynasty. The time to create these things is about 2,000 years from now. …

    In many parts of the exhibition, ancient books and inscriptions are displayed, recording the experience of our working people in engaging in production struggles throughout the ages—how to plant grains, how to cultivate fruit trees, how to grow cotton, how to protect livestock, how to fight against various insect pests, how to predict the weather and grasp the agricultural season…

    Here is a statue of the respectable Dayu—although the appearance and expression of the two statues in the comprehensive hall and the water conservancy hall are so different, that is not important. People have no way to know exactly what the heroic figure more than 3,000 years ago looked like. What is important is that it is a symbol of the great victory achieved by the ancient working people in their brave and unremitting struggle against nature. …

    For thousands and thousands of years, people have been fighting, and society has been developing. However, for thousands and thousands of years, people have not been able to control their own destiny.

    Take a look at the statistical table of water, drought, wind and freezing disasters recorded in our history from the Qin Dynasty (246 BC) to the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War (1937) in the Meteorological Museum. In these approximately two thousand years, there were 1,037 relatively large floods; there were 1,036 relatively large droughts. The records of "thousands of miles of red land," "wives and children scattered," and "people eating each other" are endless.

    Take a look at the statistical table of water and drought disasters in the last hundred years in the Water Conservancy Museum—in fact, for many people, there is no need to look at it, many tragic scenes are vividly present before them when they close their eyes.

    In order to eliminate these sufferings, to eliminate the natural and social causes that caused these sufferings, for thousands of years, people have fought heroically and unremittingly, one after another! The struggle has been going on for thousands of years, and it was not until our generation that the course of history was fundamentally reversed. As recorders and witnesses of this history, newspapers and photos publishing and recording the historical facts of the People's Liberation War and the Land Reform Movement are displayed at the exhibition. The large headlines of the old newspapers are watching us, and the victors in the photos who inserted the wooden plaques of the land they were allocated on the land are smiling and watching us, all leading us to recall the era of fiery struggle.

    While people were fighting with class enemies, under the far-sighted guidance of the Party, people realized the road to fundamentally get rid of poverty and eliminate exploitation—the road of organizing mutual assistance and cooperation. Look, this is a photo of some Jiangxi farmers who participated in the labor mutual aid society in 1931. The old man with a white beard must be reminiscing about the arduous and glorious road he has traveled? Look at another photo, a captain of the Young Pioneers in the revolutionary base area in the past is now an excellent cooperative director. That is the agricultural cooperative of Miaozhuangzi in Anse, northern Shaanxi, that is the agricultural cooperative of Wugong Township in Raoyang, Hebei, that is the agricultural cooperative of Xigou Village in Pingshun, Shanxi, they all embarked on the road of organization during the Anti-Japanese War.

    It is not easy for people to think of towering trees and boundless forests being nurtured in a seed or a few new buds. However, the course of history did not take long to prove to people that the newborn socialist seeds and seedlings that conform to the laws of social development, under certain soil and climate, grow and thrive so vigorously and become forests, showing such great power.

    This force is changing the face of our great motherland at an unprecedented speed.

    From the time our ancestors consciously used their hands to first dig up the wasteland and sow seeds, until a few years ago, it should have been more than 10,000 years? In these long years, the total area of cultivated land opened up was only a little more than 1.6 billion mu. At present, there are still about 1.5 billion mu of land left for us to reclaim.

    From 1953—the year when our country first implemented planned economic construction and the year when agricultural cooperatives began to develop relatively more—to 1956, in four years, how much wasteland was reclaimed in our country? More than 66.5 million mu; among them, more than 30 million mu were reclaimed in 1956 alone. —Still, don't forget that until now, we don't have many agricultural machines.

    In the charts at the exhibition, you can also see that from the time our ancestors first carried out farmland irrigation until the year of national liberation (1949), the area of farmland irrigation in the country was about 300 million mu. Among the existing 1.6 billion mu of cultivated land, there are still many natural conditions for building farmland water conservancy; however, the past level of development of productive forces and the conditions of production relations have hindered the construction of farmland water conservancy.

    In 1956, the area of farmland irrigation in our country soared to about 500 million mu. In this year, the expanded irrigation area in some provinces exceeded or was almost equal to the total irrigation area developed in the local history in the past! —Don't forget, until now, we don't have many machines for water conservancy and pumping.

    How many things that could not be done in the past thousands of years have been done in this year. There are many things that we still cannot do now; however, we believe that we will eventually do them!

    Eleven More Years
    On January 25, 1956, at the Supreme State Conference, Chairman Mao said: "The task of the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967 is to point out a prospect for the development of agricultural production and rural work on the basis of this upsurge of socialist transformation and socialist construction, as a goal for the struggle of farmers and agricultural workers across the country." In the National Agricultural Exhibition, from the main entrance, you can see this sentence written on the north wall of the comprehensive hall.

    1956 to 1967 is twelve years. Now, one year has passed. One year of practice has proved that the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) is basically correct and can be realized. The exhibition materials are reporting good news to everyone: the most important article of the program—the goal proposed in Article 6 for different regions to achieve in grain production in twelve years has been achieved and exceeded in thirteen counties and cities in one year; the cotton production target proposed in this article to be achieved in twelve years, calculated according to the highest number (100 catties of ginned cotton) in the three types of regions, has also been achieved on 3 million mu of land across the country. Don't forget that our industry is developing, the management level of agricultural cooperatives and the ideological awareness level of cooperative members are also constantly improving, and the conditions for agricultural production will be better year by year. If you think about it, what will the face of agriculture in our country become in eleven more years?

    "The broadest masses clearly saw their future for the first time." On December 27, 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote such a sentence in the preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside." The broad masses of farmers across the country saw their future so clearly from the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), and also saw their future more specifically from the seven-year or twelve-year long-term plans of their agricultural cooperatives. At the National Agricultural Exhibition, people can also see what the Chinese countryside will become in eleven more years. Look, here is a model of the twelve-year plan of the Foziling Agricultural Cooperative in Huoshan County, Anhui; one model is what it looked like in 1956, and one model is what it will look like in 1967: the land will be used more rationally, many bare mountain tops will be covered with lush forests, the water in the small river will bring people more grain and electricity; more light will flow along the power lines to every warm farmhouse,… Here is the schematic diagram and description of the twelve-year plan of the Wangcheng Township Agricultural Cooperative in Xishui, Hubei: In 1956, the total income of this cooperative was 360,000 yuan; in 1967, the total income of this cooperative will reach 2.57 million yuan. …

    In every hall of the exhibition, the relevant articles of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) are written in large characters. Countless exhibits fill people with more confidence in turning these articles into reality. From the flashing golden light of these large characters, people can see the brilliant future more clearly—some are already near-sighted.

    Look carefully at what the guide's pointer is pointing to! Those pointers seem to be magic wands in some myths. The guides are moving the buttons, and the schematic diagrams and models showing the changes in the appearance of the earth immediately change their appearance. "This is what it used to look like,... this is what it looks like now,... this is what it will look like in 1957,... this is what it will look like in 1962...!"

    Listen carefully to what the guide is saying! "This is Jiuchengou... distant mountains, high mountains, forest mountains, near mountains, low mountains, flower and fruit mountains,..." "This is Sanmenxia,... by then, the Yellow River will flow with clear water all year round,..." "In the Qing Dynasty, the Yellow River breached its banks, and Yifeng City became a sandy waste land,... the masses used the method of 'front blocking, rear pulling, and surrounding on all sides' to fight against quicksand, turning the 'sand kingdom' into a new village of Yifeng with apple orchards and vineyards everywhere,..." "This is Taoshanshan Village in Huaibei, with large areas of low-lying land. It floods when it rains a little, and people used to call it the 'old turtle nest.' After the transformation of the low-lying land, there was a bumper harvest..." "...what people have dreamed of for thousands of years will be realized in our generation." "...By then, cities and villages will be like lush gardens everywhere, and highways and villages will be covered with new green clothes..."

    The guide smiled brightly while talking; the visitors also laughed together while listening.

    At the exhibition, it is simply like reciting poetry everywhere, like reading scientific papers everywhere. Perhaps these sounds are very noisy, but I really think this is a harmonious chorus, or an interesting classroom discussion.

    Look again at the huge topographic map in the central hall, and think about it in connection with the scenes in each hall! From Mohe to Zengmu Ansha, from the Tianshan Mountains to the East China Sea, from forests to lakes, from the sky to the bottom of the water, from more than 1,600 rivers to 11,000 kilometers of coastline, from ancient libraries to the hearts of old people with white hair, from the hands of workers to the hands of farmers, from the laboratories of scientists to the experimental fields of young farmers... How many precious treasures and sources of happiness are hidden! Let us develop them all with our collective strength!

    In eleven more years, our motherland will have a new look.

    In eleven more years, when we look back, each of us should ask ourselves without any guilt in this great era of the great motherland!

    一年和万年
    ——全国农业展览会参观记
  　本报记者　燕凌
    最近这一年
    多么可爱的笑容，多么熟悉的笑容！这些欢笑的面孔，一年以前，我曾经在河南的农村里庆祝高级社成立的大会上看到过，曾经在北京街头的农民报喜队里看到过。现在，我又在全国农业展览会综合馆东墙上的几幅大照片里看到了。农民欢笑着拥挤在入社报名处的桌子周围，农民欢笑着举起巨大的鲜红的双喜牌走在许多城市的大街上，农民欢笑着把坚决走社会主义道路的决心书——整乡整区完成完全社会主义的农业合作化的报喜信交到毛主席手里。那是摆脱了一切忧虑的欢笑，那是充满着无限希望的欢笑，那是掌握了自己的命运的人们的满怀信心的欢笑。
    农民们带着这样的欢笑投入火热的生产斗争中去了。一组照片又把人的思想带回一年前的冬天和春天……。
    欢笑和希望并没有落空，热情的劳动并没有白费。这一年，仅仅是一年，中国人民在农业战线上前进了多少？请到这里来检阅一下吧！数目字的大军整整齐齐地排列着，精神奕奕地在向你行注目礼哩！不要嫌这许多队伍看起来太枯燥，还是把它们多比较比较、分析分析吧！你得知道，这些数目字的大军和小队能走到这个地方来，并不怎么容易。多少农民牧民渔民为它们流过汗，多少工人为它们出过力，多少商业工作者为它们跑过路，多少科学技术工作者为它们费过心，多少基层干部和领导人员为它们耗过不眠之夜……。
    不能忘记，在我们的广大的农村、牧场和渔船上，可以说还没有什么机器——即使有很少一些机器，也是微不足道的。
    不能忘记，在1956年，大自然好像故意要考验一下中国人走社会主义的道路的意志和力量似的，降给我们那么多的灾害——多少地方遭受了台风的袭击，大水的浸淹，干旱的熬煎，和别的一些折磨。
    合作制度经受住了重大的考验。尽管少数人在一些风波中又一次表现了迟疑和动摇，社会主义农业的大军却步伐越来越健壮越来越整齐地前进着。看吧，它的每个兵种，每个支队，高举着多么耀眼的成绩标志牌：粮食，1956年总产量三千六百八十五亿九千万斤，比1955年增长了大约二百亿斤；棉花，1956年总产量三千零五十万担左右，同灾害较少的1955年大体相等；主要油料，1956年总产量二万九千四百二十二万担；造林，1956年新造的面积是一千零三十一万公顷（1950年只不过十二万七千公顷）；……。
   农民的生活过得怎么样？你不必怀疑展览会上布置的那个小小农家的模型能代表多大真实性。你尽可以到非灾区的农村里看看去，不如这个农家好的自然也还有，比这个农家还强的也有的是。再看几个数目字吧：1956年，除灾区以外，80％左右的农业社增加了收入。这一年，农村的棉布消费总量是一万一千三百七十八万匹（1952年是八千六百九十三万匹，1949年是四千五百二十六万匹），糖在农村的消费总量是四十六万五千吨（1952年是二十五万三千吨，1949年是七万三千吨）……。
    谁能说，心头的甜滋味的增长同糖的消费量的增长不会成正比例？
    这一年，多么值得在若干年以后回忆和向后代子孙夸耀的一年！
    过去的万年
    “我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”在农业展览会的水利馆里，写着毛泽东同志说的这句话。这句话当然不是只指水利事业说的，也不是只指农业说的。可是，在全国农业展览会上，人们会特别容易感觉到这句话的力量，体会到这句话的意义。
    这句话决没有任何看不起我们的祖先的意思，而只是说明我们这一代人没有辜负我们的伟大的祖先千百万年的辛劳和期望。我们继承了、发扬了先人所创造的一切优秀的东西，洗刷着、抛弃着历史上遗留下来的一切不合理的东西，使我们伟大的祖国潜藏着的人力物力得到了空前有利的条件，在大地上和大海上大放光芒。
    看，那块暗红色的石头，那是我们的祖先用过的犁；那块青灰色的石头，那是我们的祖先用过的镰。这里还有几幅图画：赤身露体、只在腰间围着兽皮的人们，在荒野上艰难地打猎、牧畜，在拉着犁开垦山野间的荒地。文字说明：这是公元前一万年到二千年左右我国原始社会人们生产和生活的情形。渐渐地，人们学会用牛拉犁了，学会种更多的谷物了。在公元前一千多年的商代遗留下来的甲骨上，人们可以看到“黍”“麦”“禾”“犁”“耒”等文字的原始形状，还可以看到天气的记录。渐渐地，人们学会用铁器了，征服自然的力量大大加强了。你看，那是洛阳汉代古墓出土的五种谷物；那嘴里衔着一朵花立在杆顶的一只鸟，是汉代的“风信鸡”。创造这些东西的时间，离现在是二千年左右了。……
    在展览会的许多部分，陈列着记载我国劳动人民历代从事生产斗争的经验的古籍和碑刻——怎样种植五谷，怎样栽培果木，怎样作务棉花，怎样保护牲畜，怎样同各种虫害作斗争，怎样预测天气和掌握农时……
    这里有可尊敬的大禹的塑像——尽管在综合馆里的同在水利馆里的两座像的面貌和神情是多么不同，那也无关重要。人们没法确切知道三千多年前的英雄人物究竟是个什么样子。重要的是，它是古代劳动人民同大自然作英勇的不懈的斗争取得伟大胜利的象征。……
    成千年，成万年，人们在斗争着，社会在发展着。可是，成千年，成万年，人们没法掌握自己的命运。
    看一看气象馆里的从秦（公元前246年）到抗日战争开始那一年（1937年）我国历史上有记载的水旱风冻灾害统计表吧。在这大约两千年间比较大的水灾，就有一千零三十七次；比较大的旱灾，就有一千零三十六次。“赤野千里”“妻离子散”“人相食”的记载连篇累牍。
    再看一看水利馆里的近百年间的水旱灾害统计表吧——其实，对于许多人来说，不必看它，许多悲惨的景象是闭起眼睛就历历如在目前的。
    为了消除这些苦难，消除造成这些苦难的自然原因和社会原因，千百万年来，人们前仆后继，作了多少壮烈的可歌可泣的斗争！斗争进行了千百万年，到了我们这一代，才从根本上扭转了历史的轨道。作为这段历史的纪录者和见证人，刊登着记载着人民解放战争和土地改革运动的史实的报纸和照片在展览会上陈列着。陈旧了的报纸的大字标题注视着我们，照片上把分得土地的木牌插在土地上的胜利者欢笑着注视着我们，都引我们去回忆那火热的斗争的年代。
    正当人们同阶级敌人搏斗的时候，在党的高瞻远瞩的指引下，人们就认识到了从根本上摆脱贫困、消灭剥削的道路——组织起来互助合作的道路。你看，这是1931年参加过劳动互助社的一部分江西农民的照片，那位白髯飘飘的老人，该是在回想着自己走过的艰苦的光荣的道路吧？看另一张照片吧，当年革命根据地的少年先锋队的一个队长，如今是一个优秀的社主任了。那是陕北安塞苗庄子的农业社，那是河北饶阳五公乡的农业社，那是山西平顺西沟村的农业社，它们在抗日战争时期就都走上了组织起来的道路。
    人们很不容易在看到一粒种子或几个新芽的时候想到在它中间孕育着参天的大树和无边的森林。可是，历史的进程并没有多久就向人们证明了：新生的合乎社会发展规律的社会主义的种子和幼苗，在一定的土壤和气候下，多么蓬勃地成长壮大、蔚然成林了，表现出了多么巨大的力量。
    这力量正在以前所未有的速度改变着我们伟大的祖国的面貌。
    从我们的祖先有意识地用他们的双手第一次掘开荒地播下种子那时候开始，到最近几年以前，总该有万年以上了吧？在这悠久的岁月里，开垦出来的耕地总面积是十六亿亩多一些。目前，大约还有十五亿亩土地留给我们去开垦。
    从1953年——我国历史上第一次实行有计划的经济建设开头那一年、农业合作社开始比较多地发展的那一年开始，到1956年，四年间，在我国开垦了多少荒地？六千六百五十多万亩；其中，在1956年一年开垦的就有三千多万亩。——仍然不要忘记，直到目前为止，我们还没有多少农业机器。
    在展览会上的图表里还可以看到，从我们的祖先最初进行农田灌溉的时候开始，到全国解放那一年（1949年）为止，全国的农田灌溉面积大约是三亿亩。在已有的十六亿多亩耕地中，还有许多是有兴修农田水利的自然条件的；可是，过去生产力发展的水平和生产关系的条件都妨碍着农田水利的兴修。
    1956年，我国的农田灌溉面积突飞猛进到了大约五亿亩。这一年，有些省份扩大的灌溉面积超过或者几乎等于当地过去历史上开辟的灌溉面积的总和！——也不要忘记，直到目前为止，我们还没有多少兴修水利和抽水的机器。
    有多少在过去千年万年办不到的事，在这一年办到了。有许多事我们现在仍然办不到；可是，我们相信，终于会办到的！
    再过十一年
    1956年1月25日，在最高国务会议上，毛主席说：“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要的任务，就是在这个社会主义改造和社会主义建设的高潮的基础上，给农业生产和农村工作的发展指出一个远景，作为全国农民和农业工作者的奋斗目标。”在全国农业展览会里，从正门进去，一眼就可以望见在综合馆的北墙上写着这句话。
    1956年到1967年是十二年的时间。现在，一年已经过去了。一年的实践已经证明了全国农业发展纲要（草案）基本上是正确的，是能够实现的。展览会展出材料在向大家报喜：纲要的最重要的一条——第六条提出的三种不同地区粮食在十二年内要达到的目标，一年内就已经在十三个县市实现并且超过了；这一条所提出的十二年内要达到的棉花产量指标，按三类地区的最高数（一百斤皮棉）计算，也在全国各地的三百万亩土地上实现了。别忘了，我们的工业正在发展，农业社的经营管理水平和社员的思想觉悟水平也正在不断提高，农业生产的条件将会一年比一年更好。再过十一年，我国的农业面貌会变成什么样子，你试想一想。
    “最广大的群众第一次清楚地看见了自己的将来。”1955年12月27日，毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言里写下了这样一句话。全国农民群众从全国农业发展纲要（草案）中这样清楚地看见了自己的将来，也从自己的农业社的七年或者十二年的远景规划中更具体地看见了自己的将来。在全国农业展览会上，人们也可以看到，再过十一年以后，中国农村会变成什么样子。看吧，这里是安徽霍山县佛子岭农业社的十二年规划的模型；一个模型是1956年的样子，一个模型是1967年将会变成的样子：土地将会使用得更加合理，许多秃山顶将要长满葱绿的树林，小河里的水将要给人们带来更多的粮食和电力；更多的光明，将要顺着电线流向每一个温暖的农家，……。这里是湖北浠水望城乡农业社的十二年规划示意图和说明：1956年，这个社的总收入是三十六万元；1967年，这个社的总收入将会达到二百五十七万元。……
    展览会的每个馆里，都大字书写着全国农业发展纲要（草案）的有关的条文。无数的展品，使人们对于把这些条文变成现实更加充满了信心。从这些大字的闪闪金光里，人们更清楚地看到了灿烂的远景——有些已经是近景了。
    你仔细地看讲解员的指示棒在指点些什么吧！那些指示棒，仿佛是一些神话里的魔杖。讲解员们在搬动着电钮，那些表示大地面貌的变化的示意图和模型立即变了样子。“这是过去的样子，……这是现在的样子，……这是1957年要变成的样子，……这是1962年要变成的样子……！”
    你好好地听讲解员在说些什么吧！“这是韭园沟……远山高山森林山，近山低山花果山，……”“这是三门峡，……到那时，黄河要终年流着碧水，……”“清代黄河决口，仪封城变成一片沙荒，……群众用‘前挡后拉四面围攻’的办法同流沙斗争，把‘沙土国’变成了遍地苹果园、葡萄园的仪封新村，……”“这是淮北的桃山集，有大片的洼地，下一点雨就涝，人们过去把它叫做‘老鳖窝’。经过洼地改造，丰收了。……”“……几千年人们梦想的，就要在我们这一代实现。”“……到那时，城市和农村遍地像葱绿的花园，公路和村庄都披上了绿色的新装……”
    讲解员讲着讲着，灿然地笑了；参观的人们听着听着，也一同笑了。
    展览会上，简直到处都像在朗诵诗，到处都像在宣读科学论文。也许这些声音是很嘈杂的，可是，我的确觉得这是和谐的大合唱，或者是有趣的课堂讨论。
    再看看中央大厅的巨大的地形图，把它同各个馆的景象连系起来想想吧！从漠河到曾母暗砂，从天山到东海，从森林到湖泊，从天空中到水底下，从一千六百多条河流到一万一千公里的海岸线，从古老的藏书楼到须发斑白的老人的心窝，从工人的双手到农民的双手，从科学家的研究室到青年农民的试验地……蕴藏着多少珍贵的财富和幸福的源泉！用我们的集体的力量把它们都开发出来吧！
    再过十一年，我们的祖国将会又是一幅新的面貌。
    再过十一年，再回过头来看的时候，我们每一个人都应该问心无愧于伟大的祖国的这个伟大的时代！
