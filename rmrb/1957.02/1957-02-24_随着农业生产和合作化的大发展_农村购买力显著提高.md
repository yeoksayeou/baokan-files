Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: A series of charts and statistics at the National Agricultural Exhibition illustrate the tremendous changes that have taken place in the material and cultural life of the countryside with the development of agricultural production and the great expansion of cooperativization. The figures tell us that last year, after the basic realization of advanced cooperativization throughout the country, about 80% of cooperative members, excluding disaster areas, increased their income. As a result, rural purchasing power increased by 61.8% compared to 1952, with a 191.7% increase in means of production and a 41.8% increase in means of livelihood.

In recent years, the commodity with the largest sales volume in rural areas has been cotton cloth. The red line on the chart, which has been rising continuously, shows that the sales volume of cotton cloth increased from 45.26 million bolts in 1949 to 113.78 million bolts in 1956. During the same period, the sales of rubber shoes also increased from 7.9 million pairs to 36.39 million pairs, salt increased by more than 59%, and sugar increased more than fivefold.

The cultural life and sanitary conditions of the broad masses of peasants have also greatly improved. In 1956, there were already 2,558 cultural stations in rural areas, with more than 75 million people participating in amateur cultural learning. Clubs and libraries in rural areas have been established in many agricultural cooperatives. From the pictures of the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, exhibited at the exhibition, we can see that many agricultural cooperatives have established kindergartens or nurseries to solve the difficulties of female cooperative members going to the fields to work. Anyone who frequently goes to the countryside feels that it is more convenient to see a doctor in rural areas. As of September last year, there were 78,087 health institutions throughout the country's rural areas.

The exhibition also features a model of a family, the family of Xin Changming, a member of the Tiancun Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing. This farmer, who came from a hired peasant background, had a total labor income of more than 1,400 yuan last year for his family of ten. From the model, we can see that the furnishings in his home are already equivalent to those of a middle peasant.

    随着农业生产和合作化的大发展
    农村购买力显著提高
    新华社22日讯　全国农业展览会上有一系列的图表和统计数字说明：随着农业生产发展和合作化的大发展，农村物质和文化生活都起了巨大的变化。数字告诉人们，去年，全国基本上实现高级合作化以后，除灾区外，有80％左右的社员增加收入，因此，农村的购买力比1952年增长了61.8％，其中，生产资料增长191.7％，生活资料增长41.8％。
    几年来在农村销售量最大的货物要算棉布，图表上一直上升的红线表明：棉布销售量1949年是四千五百二十六万匹，而1956年即增加到一万一千三百七十八万匹，同一时期，胶鞋的销数也由七百九十万双增加到三千六百三十九万双，食盐增加59％以上，食糖增加了五倍多。
    广大农民的文化生活和卫生条件也有了很大改善。1956年，农村已经有文化站二千五百五十八个，参加业余文化学习的人达七千五百万人以上。农村的俱乐部、图书馆，已经在很多农业社建立起来了。从展出的黑龙江省桦川县星火集体农庄的图片上可以知道，已有不少农业社为解决女社员下地生产的困难而建立了幼儿园或托儿所。凡是经常下乡的人，都感到在农村看病方便了。截至去年9月，遍布全国农村的卫生机构已有七万八千零八十七所。
    展览会上还有一个家庭的模型，这是北京市郊田村农业社社员辛长明的家庭。这个雇农出身的农民全家十口人，去年的劳动收入达一千四百多元。从模型上可以看到，他家中的陈设已经相当于一个中农。
