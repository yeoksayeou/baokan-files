    Anglo-American Relations After the Suez Ceasefire
          By Ke Ke Si (柯克斯), Secretary of the International Department of the British Communist Party
    Sir Anthony Eden's political career is over. The various problems caused by the disastrous British Conservative aggression against Egypt remain unresolved.
    Everyone knows that Eisenhower and important officials in the US government welcomed Eden's downfall. The event was probably brought about by American pressure, as even the "Daily Telegraph" (a major Conservative organ) found it necessary to state: "We are not changing our Prime Minister at the behest of the Americans." (January 10, 1957) In the eyes of British political figures, such denials in the newspapers usually mean the exact opposite!
    Harold Macmillan has taken office as the new Prime Minister. He has chosen a cabinet of big business figures, and one of the first problems this cabinet must solve is the conflict with the United States caused by the aggression against Egypt. This conflict has exposed with unprecedented sharpness the conflict of interests that has existed between these two imperialist powers in their development over the past decades.
    As early as 1940, MacCormac described the strategy of American imperialism with the following words:
    "As Britain weakens, America must correspondingly strengthen. As Britain's mastery of the world diminishes, America's domination must expand, and in areas where British dominance ends, American pressure must begin." ("America and World Dominion")
    In order to achieve its goal of world domination, after the Second World War, the United States sought to form alliances with reactionary governments against the Soviet Union. This led to the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and a series of military alliances around the world.
    Indeed, British and French imperialists understood that the Marshall Plan and other American plans were not for their particular benefit. But they were still prepared to accept American orders as the price of building an alliance aimed at stopping the expansion of socialism and destroying the colonial liberation movement.
    The strategy of the United States, with its vast financial resources, was to win its hegemony through economic pressure and political interference, combined with military aid to those reactionary governments willing to sell out their sovereignty and act as partners in aggression. On the other hand, British and French imperialism, already weakened by the advancing tide of colonial liberation and undermined everywhere by American imperialism, faced a more desperate situation.
    British imperialism, facing the growing liberation movement in all its colonies and the increasing penetration of American imperialism into the former British sphere of influence, was particularly alarmed by the weakening of its dominance in the Middle East. Therefore, the Conservative Party decided to strike hard at Egypt, which was quickly becoming the vanguard of the entire Arab liberation movement.
    The U.S. government watched with satisfaction as its "partner" approached the brink of disaster, hoping that this would give U.S. imperialism an opportunity to fill the "power vacuum" in the Middle East.
    This gave Eisenhower the opportunity to play the warrior of peace and enabled him to win the presidential election in November 1956. But as soon as the election was over, Eisenhower's new "doctrine" brought the American people back to reality and confronted the people of the Arab countries and the world with a new threat of aggression. Just as British and French imperialism was going bankrupt, American imperialists were planning to take over in the Middle East.
    Of course, all this is under the pretext of "protecting" the "independence" of Middle Eastern countries and freeing them from the fictitious so-called Soviet "aggression." In fact, the main goal of the Eisenhower Plan is to establish American rule in the region.
    The new Eisenhower Doctrine has three main objectives:
    1. Increase American monopoly control over the resources of the Middle East, especially oil reserves.
    2. Expand American political influence to stop the advance of the Arab liberation movement.
    3. Provide military support to those reactionary governments willing to cooperate with America's aggressive military plans, and use economic aid to win over the governments of other countries.
    This doctrine is nothing new, but merely a revised version of the main strategic line of American imperialism. It is not the first time that an American president has announced military and economic aid to Middle Eastern countries and other countries that American imperialism wants to control. This has been the case since the Mutual Security Act and President Truman's Point Four Program.
    From 1946 to 1955, the US government allocated 51 billion US dollars for "foreign aid bills," of which 70% was used for Europe, 20% for Asia, and only 8% for the Middle East and Africa combined.
    Now, President Eisenhower has proposed to allocate an additional 200 million US dollars each to the Middle East in the 1958 and 1959 fiscal years. The proportion of military aid and economic aid has not been revealed. But even if it is all used for economic aid (which of course will not be the case), it will only be equal to one-sixth of the profits made by American oil trusts in the Middle East in 1955.
    The insignificant economic aid given by the U.S. government to the Middle East accounts for only a small part of its large amount of military aid to the Middle East, and this military aid is used to achieve its goal of dragging these countries into its aggressive military plans.
    In Britain, the Eisenhower Plan has been received in various ways. Within the Conservative Party, there is deep anger at the United States for not supporting Britain's aggression against Egypt, but relief that the United States has now finally stepped into the "power vacuum" in the Middle East. Some spokesmen with Conservative views ridiculed the US government for not supporting Britain's aggression earlier, and they tried their best to boast about the success of letting Eisenhower take the lead!
    The "Daily Telegraph," a major expression of government policy, declared: "What the Americans are doing today is exactly what we have been asking them to do for a long time: that is, to recognize that the Middle East is a region of important interests to them and to us alike." However, this newspaper still doubted that American imperialism was not eager to protect British interests, as it continued to point out: "The fact is that for a period of time, Washington relied on sacrificing British interests to gain influence and prestige in the Middle East. But what will happen when there are no more significant British interests that can be sacrificed?" ("Daily Telegraph", January 9, 1956)
    The leaders of British big capitalists hold feelings of anger and distrust towards American imperialism, but they are still prepared to admit that the United States is the decisive power in supporting the imperialist world against the growing influence of socialism and against the colonial liberation movement throughout the world.
    From the Conservative "Times" to the Liberal "Manchester Guardian," they all admit that they must rely on American imperialism. Therefore, the "Manchester Guardian" pointed out: "If the Americans do not understand the relationship between foreign investment and their interests, then everything we value is unreliable." (See the newspaper on December 7, 1956) After expressing concern about the United States' intentions, the "Financial Times" made this reservation: "But for Britain, the biggest interest in the Middle East is the supply of oil. As long as the United States controls the Middle East, then the oil supply in Europe will be safe." (See the newspaper on January 2, 1957) However, this statement is unreliable, because American oil trusts are now blackmailing Britain by maintaining the oil supply at a low level while raising oil prices, making it difficult for it.
    A major weekly magazine, "The Economist," gave the following explanation of Eisenhower's Middle East Plan:
    "The crisis in the Middle East has not passed. The canal and pipelines are still blocked. Russian influence continues to penetrate. Peace in Palestine is still nowhere in sight. The danger points for the outbreak of new riots and new wars still exist. At present, Britain is powerless to do anything but stand by and avoid causing greater damage, and can only welcome the United States' decision to no longer be inactive."
    (January 5, 1957)
    British officials are still not too weak to protest the fact that Texaco Oil Company refused to transport more crude oil to relieve Britain's crisis. However, an American official retorted that Texas (where Texaco Oil Company is located) has its own laws, and he claimed: "The British should be told that independent Texas has more independence from Washington than the independent British Empire." This made the American government's contemptuous attitude obvious.
    Even more explicit are those Conservatives who launched the aggression against Egypt. In 1956, when Egypt had just recovered the Suez Canal Company, they advocated launching a military invasion. They opposed accepting the United Nations' decision and believed that the ceasefire was a betrayal. One of their leaders, Julian Amery, pointed out when speaking at the European Committee meeting in Strasbourg: "The price the United States has demanded for post-war aid to Europe is submission to its leadership... I want to say that the main force driving Britain out of the Middle East is American policy... In fact, Britain and France have been warned to leave the Middle East. This is intolerable." ("Daily Telegraph", January 10, 1957)
    Serious divisions have emerged among Labor Party leaders regarding Eisenhower's plan. Mr. Gaitskell welcomed Eisenhower's new statement, and Earl Attlee also praised the steps he had taken. But on the other hand, Bevan, the main spokesman for the Labor Party's left wing, condemned the plan as a danger to peace in the Middle East. This is also the political view of most people in the British labor movement. They will oppose this new threat to peace with the same strong attitude as they opposed the Conservative Party's aggression against Egypt.
    In contrast to the opinions of the Conservative Party and the working class, Francis Williams, the former editor of the "Daily Herald Forum," made an interesting side note. He writes a weekly review of the press in the magazine "New Statesman and Nation." In his recent review, he said that the "Financial Times" stated: "President Eisenhower is only willing to promise help to those countries that are subject to Russian military aggression." Then, he pointed out that the British "Worker's Daily" had a much deeper view on this matter. Because the latter pointed out: "In recent years, despite the crazy ravings against the Russians and the Chinese, the British people and many British capitalists are the real targets and victims of American imperialism."
    Francis Williams went on to point out, "If Threadneedle Street has to rely on the British 'Worker's Daily' rather than the 'Financial Times' to sound the alarm, then things are indeed bad enough." (Threadneedle Street is the location of the major banks and stock exchanges in London)
    The British people are paying a heavy price for the aggression against Egypt. The shortage of oil supplies has weakened transportation, closed many factories, caused greater unemployment, and shortened working hours in many industrial sectors. Oil prices have risen, and the prices of most daily necessities have also risen. Heavier burdens are being placed on British workers, and plans are currently being drawn up to further attack their living standards.
    Eisenhower's new plan may even lead to greater disasters. Through the labor movement, people are realizing that the future of the British people does not depend on accepting American rule, let alone on the Conservative Party's aggression against colonies and Arab nations who are fighting to achieve and maintain their independence.
    It is this deep belief that forms the basis for opposing the Conservative Party's rule in Britain and demanding an early general election. The British people demand a new government that is determined to maintain peace, respect the sovereignty of all countries, and stop colonial wars. This government will refuse to accept American rule and will conduct friendly negotiations with the Soviet Union to peacefully resolve all differences in order to promote the cause of world peace.

    苏伊士停火以后的英美关系
          英国共产党国际部书记　柯克斯
    艾登爵士的政治事业完结了。因保守党对埃及的灾难性的侵略而引起的各种问题仍然没有解决。
    人人都知道，艾森豪威尔和美国政府中的重要官员都欢迎艾登垮台。这次事件大概是美国的压力所促成的，因为“每日电讯报”（主要的保守党机关报）竟认为有必要声明：“我们不是听从美国人的吩咐换掉我们的首相的。”（1957年1月10日）在英国政界人士看来，报纸上的这些否认，照例是意味着正相反的事！
    麦克米伦出任了新的首相。他选择了一个大企业内阁，这个内阁所首先要解决的问题之一就是由于侵略埃及事件而引起的同美国的冲突。这次冲突空前尖锐地暴露了这两个帝国主义强国在过去数十年发展中存在的利益冲突。
    早在1940年，麦考马克就用下列的话说明了美帝国主义的战略：
    “随着英国的削弱，美国必须相应地强大起来。由于英国对世界霸权的掌握缩小，美国的统治必须扩大起来，在英国优势告终的地区，美国的高压必须开始。”（“美国和世界统治”）
    为了达到它的统治世界的目标，在第二次世界大战以后，美国就设法同那些反动的政府结成联盟来反对苏联。这就导致了马歇尔计划、北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织以及遍及全世界的一系列的军事同盟。
    的确，英、法帝国主义者也懂得，马歇尔计划和其他美国的计划都不是为了他们的特殊利益。但是他们仍然准备接受美国的号令，把它作为建立目的在于制止社会主义扩大和摧毁殖民地解放运动的同盟所出的代价。
    握有巨大财政资源的美国的策略，就是通过经济压力和政治干涉，结合着对那些甘愿出卖自己主权、充当一个侵略伙伴的反动政府的军事援助，来赢得自己的霸权。另一方面，已经为殖民地解放的前进巨浪所削弱并到处受到美帝国主义破坏的英、法帝国主义，面临一个更加绝望的处境。
    英帝国主义，面对着它的所有殖民地中日益增长的解放运动和美帝国主义对前大英帝国势力范围的日益渗入，对于自己在中东的支配力的削弱，特别感到惊慌。于是保守党决定用力打击很快地成为整个阿拉伯解放运动的先锋的埃及。
    美国政府满意地望着它的“伙伴”走近了灾难的边缘，希望这会给美帝国主义在中东以填补“势力真空”的机会。
    这给了艾森豪威尔以扮演和平战士的机会，并使他在1956年11月的总统选举中得以获胜。但是选举一结束，艾森豪威尔的新“主义”就使美国人民回到现实，并使阿拉伯国家的人民和全世界人民面临了新的侵略威胁。正当英、法帝国主义破产的时候，美帝国主义者却正计划在中东进行接收。
    不错，所有这一切都是以“保护”中东国家“独立”使它们免受虚构的所谓苏联“侵略”为口实。实际上艾森豪威尔计划的主要目标是要在这个地区建立美国的统治。
    新的艾森豪威尔主义有三个主要目标：
    1、增大美国对中东的资源、特别是石油储备的垄断权。
    2、扩大美国的政治影响以阻挡阿拉伯解放运动的前进。
    3、给那些愿意同美国的侵略性军事计划合作的反动政府以军事支助，并用经济援助来笼络其他国家的政府。
    这个主义绝不是什么新的东西，而只是美帝国主义主要策略路线的改版。由美国总统来宣布给中东国家和美帝国主义所要控制的其他国家以军事和经济的援助，已经不是第一次了。这从共同安全法和杜鲁门总统的第四点计划开始就是这样。
    从1946年到1955年，美国政府为“援外法案”拨付了五百一十亿美元，其中70％用于欧洲，20％用于亚洲，而在中东和非洲这两个地区一共只用了8％。
    现在，艾森豪威尔总统建议在1958和1959两财政年度里再各多拨给中东以二亿美元的援助。其中军事援助和经济援助所占的比例尚没有透露。但即使是全部用于经济援助（当然不会这样），也只等于1955年美国石油托辣斯在中东所获利润的六分之一。
    美国政府给予中东的微不足道的经济援助只占它给中东的大量军事援助的极小部分，而这种军事援助则是用来达成它的把这些国家拖入自己的侵略性军事计划的目的的。
    在英国，艾森豪威尔计划受到了各色各样的接待。在保守党内部，对美国不出力支持英国侵略埃及固然深为愤怒，但对美国现在总算已插足中东的“势力真空”却感到轻松。抱着保守党见地的一些发言人讥笑美国政府不早日支持英国的侵略，他们并竭力夸耀让艾森豪威尔来取得领导权的得计！
    政府政策的主要表达者“每日电讯报”曾宣称：“美国人今天所做的事正是我们长期以来所要求他们做的：这就是承认中东对他们和对我们一样，都是重要利益之所在。”然而，这个报纸还是怀疑美帝国主义并不急于保护英国的利益，因为它继续指出：“事实是，有一个时期，华盛顿曾依靠牺牲英国的利益，而在中东发生影响，获得声望。但是当着已经没有什么显著的英国利益可以再供牺牲的时候，那又会怎么样呢？”（“每日电讯报”，1956年1月9日）
    英国的大资本家领袖人物们抱着对美帝国主义的愤怒和不信任的感情，但是，他们仍然准备承认：在支撑帝国主义世界对抗社会主义日益扩大的影响、对抗整个世界殖民地解放运动的事情上，美国是有决定意义的强国。
    从保守党的“泰晤士报”起到自由党的“曼彻斯特卫报”止，都承认必须依靠美帝国主义。因此“曼彻斯特卫报”指出：“如果美国人不了解外国的投资与他们的利害关系，那么我们所重视的一切，都是靠不住的。”（见1956年12月7日该报）在对美国的企图表示了不安以后，“金融时报”作了这样的保留：“但是对英国来说，在中东最大的利益就是石油的供应。只要有一天美国控制着中东，那么欧洲的石油供应就会是安全的。”（见1957年1月2日该报）但是，这种说法并不可靠，因为美国的石油托辣斯现在就已用把石油供应维持在一个低的水平同时并提高油价的办法来勒索英国，使它为难了。
    一家重要周刊“经济学家”杂志，对艾森豪威尔的中东计划作了下列解释：
    “中东的危机决没有过去。运河和油管仍然封锁着。俄国的势力继续在渗入。巴勒斯坦的和平还完全看不到。爆发新骚乱和新战争的危险点仍然存在着。目前，英国除了旁观和避免造成更大的损害以外无能为力，只有欢迎美国的不再无所行动的决定。”
    （1957年1月5日）
    英国的官员们对于德士古石油公司拒绝运送更多原油以解救英国的危机一点，还不是软弱到不敢提抗议的地步。不过，美国的一位官员反驳说，得克萨斯州（即德士古石油公司所在的州）有自己的法律，他并声称：“应当告诉英国人，独立的得克萨斯州对于华盛顿比起大英帝国这个独立的国家来，还拥有更大的独立性。”这就使得美国政府的轻蔑态度表露无遗了。
    说得更露骨的是那些发动对埃及的侵略的保守党人。在1956年埃及刚收回苏伊士运河公司时，他们就主张发动军事侵略。他们反对接受联合国的决定，并认为停火就是出卖。他们的领袖之一朱利安·埃麦里在斯特拉斯堡的欧洲委员会会议上讲话时曾指出：“战后美国援助欧洲所索取的代价就是对它的领导的屈从……。我想要说的是，把英国从中东赶走的主要力量就是美国的政策……实际上，英国和法国曾经受到离开中东的警告。这是不能容忍的。”（1957年1月10日“每日电讯报”）
    在工党领袖中对艾森豪威尔的计划已表现出严重的分歧。盖次克尔先生欢迎艾森豪威尔的新的声明，艾德礼伯爵也夸奖了他所采取的步骤。但是另一方面，工党左派主要发言人比万则谴责这个计划是对中东和平的危险。这也是英国工人运动中大多数人的政治见解。他们将以反对保守党侵略埃及的强烈态度来反对这个对和平的新的威胁。
    在保守党和工人阶级的意见相对照的情况下，前“每日先驱论坛报”的编者法兰西斯·威廉斯作了一个有趣的侧面说明。他是在“新政治家与民族”杂志上专写一周报刊评述的。他在最近的一期评述中说，“金融时报”曾表示：“艾森豪威尔总统只愿意答应帮助那些受俄国军事侵略的国家。”接着，他就指出英国“工人日报”对这件事的看法要深远得多。因为后者指出：在最近几年中尽管有反对俄国人和中国人的疯狂呓语，但是英国人民和英国的许多资本家才是美帝国主义的真正目标和牺牲者”。
    法兰西斯·威廉斯接着指出，“如果特罗密尔顿街必须依靠英国‘工人日报’而不是依靠‘金融时报’来敲警钟，那么事情确是够糟的了。”（特罗密尔顿街是伦敦大银行和证券交易所的所在地）
    英国人民正在为侵略埃及付出沉重的代价。石油供应的短缺，削弱了运输，使许多工厂关闭，造成更大的失业，并使许多工业部门缩短了工作时间。石油价格已经上涨，而多数日用品的价格也已上升。更重的负担正在加于英国工人的身上，而目前还在拟订计划对他们的生活水平作进一步的攻击。
    艾森豪威尔的新计划甚至可能导致更大的灾难。通过工人运动，人们正在认识到，英国人民的未来并不依赖于接受美国统治，更不依赖于保守党对殖民地和对正在为达到和维持它们独立而奋斗的阿拉伯民族的侵略。
    正是这样一种深刻的信念构成了反对保守党在英国的统治和要求提前举行大选的基础。英国人民要求的是一个决心维持和平、尊重一切国家主权、并停止殖民战争的新政府，这个政府将拒绝接受美国的统治，并将同苏联进行友好谈判来和平解决一切分歧，以促进世界的和平事业。
