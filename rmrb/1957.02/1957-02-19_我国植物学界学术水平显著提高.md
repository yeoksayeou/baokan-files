Xinhua News Agency report: The academic discussion meeting of the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, which lasted for six days, closed on the 16th. The more than 70 papers discussed at the meeting, including plant classification and geography, ecology, geobotany, morphology, anatomy, cytology, plant introduction, domestication, cultivation, and breeding, etc., mark the significant improvement of the academic level of China's botany field.

In the field of plant classification research, botanists believe that some of the papers presented at the meeting have reached the international level. Zhong Buqiu's "A New System of the Artemisia subgenus Seriphidium," which won the second prize of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Award, is considered to be one of the most outstanding academic works in modern plant classification. Plant ecology and geobotany are still young disciplines that have only developed in recent years in China. Most of the more than 20 papers in this area were written by young scientific workers. The papers include vegetation surveys and research in important areas of China from Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang to Hainan Island, providing extremely valuable materials for national economic zoning, meteorology, soil and other natural zoning.

There were a total of thirteen papers on plant introduction, cultivation, and breeding. At the meeting, everyone was very interested in the question of how to explore China's aromatic plant resources in the future. China has a total of 220 kinds of aromatic plants. Everyone suggested that the botanical garden of the Institute of Botany should actively carry out the cultivation and refining analysis of aromatic plants, so as to provide scientific data for the development of China's aromatic oil industry. Yu Dejun's report on the first volume of the Chinese Fruit Tree Flora introduced the analysis of varieties in seven key pear-producing areas in North China, which was highly praised by everyone.

The person in charge of the Academic Committee of the Institute of Botany believes that this academic discussion meeting reflects some of the achievements in comprehensive plant research work since liberation. However, judging from the more than 70 papers presented, the development among various disciplines is still not balanced. Chinese plant classification has a history of 40 to 50 years, and there are also more experts. However, plant ecology and geobotany have a shorter history, especially in the past, due attention was not paid to disciplines such as plant morphology, cytology, and embryology. Therefore, systematically and vigorously training young scientific workers in these areas is a huge task.

### 我国植物学界学术水平显著提高

    我国植物学界学术水平显著提高
    据新华社讯　历时六天的中国科学院植物研究所学术讨论会于16日闭幕。会上讨论的七十多篇论文，包括植物分类和地理、生态、地植物、形态、解剖、细胞、植物引种、驯化、栽培、选育等方面，它们标志着我国植物学界学术水平的显著提高。
    在植物分类研究方面，植物学家认为会上提出的有些论文已经达到了国际水平。获得中国科学院科学奖金二等奖的钟补求的“马光蒿属的一个新系统”，大家认为是近代植物分类学中最出色的学术著作之一。植物生态学及地植物学在中国还是近年来才发展的年轻学科。这方面的二十多篇论文大部分是年轻科学工作者作的。论文包括从内蒙古、新疆到海南岛等我国重要地区的植被调查和研究，为国家经济区划、气象、土壤等自然区划提供极有价值材料。
    植物引种、栽培和育种方面共有十三篇论文。会上，大家对今后如何发掘我国芳香植物资源的问题，感到很大兴趣。中国共有二百二十种芳香植物。大家建议植物研究所植物园应积极展开芳香植物的栽培和提炼分析工作，为发展我国芳香油工业提供科学资料。俞德浚的中国果树志第一卷的报告，介绍了华北七个重点梨区品种分析的情况，大家给予很高的评价。
    植物研究所学术委员会的负责人认为，这次学术讨论会反映了解放以来在综合性的植物研究工作中的一些成果。但是从提出的七十多篇论文来看，各个学科间的发展还是不够平衡的，中国植物分类学已经有了四、五十年的历史，专家也较多。而植物生态学及地植物学的历史较短，特别是过去对植物形态、细胞、胚胎等学科未予应有的重视，因此有计划地大力培养这些方面的年轻科学工作者是个巨大的任务。
