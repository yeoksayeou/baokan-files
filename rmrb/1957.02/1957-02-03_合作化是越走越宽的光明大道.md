    Cooperativization is a Broad and Bright Road
            Geng Changsuo, Director of Wugong Township Agricultural Cooperative, Raoyang County, Hebei

    What exactly has the superior system of cooperatives brought to the farmers of Wugong Township? In a word, it has brought us a happy life and eliminated poverty and hunger. Old Wugong Township was a poor village. Whenever there were natural disasters, farmers would often flee to the east with their families. However, since 1943, under the leadership of the Party, we have gradually embarked on the road of cooperativization, and both production and living standards have greatly improved. In the era of the small-peasant economy, the average yield per mu was over 170 jin. After cooperativization, it increased to 463 jin (in 1955). Although we suffered from the worst floods in decades last year, the average yield per mu was still 347 jin. With the increase in production, life is getting better day by day, and there have been improvements in housing, clothing, and food. In the past five years, 108 new brick houses have been built in Wugong Village, and people wearing tattered clothes are no longer seen. From these facts, the cooperative system is the only way for the vast number of farmers to achieve a happy life, and it is also a broad and bright road. There is no doubt about this.

    Some people think: since we have advanced cooperatives, why haven't we eaten milk and bread? Therefore, they say that advanced cooperatives have no advantages. I would also like to share my understanding of this issue. In 1952, I visited a Soviet collective farm (which is now our advanced cooperative). The members did eat bread, drink milk, have meat with every meal, live in tiled houses, and wear good clothes. However, I want to tell everyone that this happy life did not fall from the sky for nothing, but is the result of the Soviet farmers' hard work and arduous labor over the past thirty years. Comrade Dubkovetsky, chairman of the October Victory Collective Farm in the Ukrainian Republic, led us to visit the home of Vasily, a member of the farm, when we visited. There were five people in this family, with three laborers. In 1951, the whole family earned 1,344 workdays, and received a total of 8,064 rubles in cash, 123 poods of grain, and also had private property of one dairy cow, producing 2,000 liters of milk, which could be converted into 4,000 rubles, three pigs, which could bring in 4,500 rubles, and other income from fruits and vegetables. His family's life was indeed good, with bread, milk, and pork at every meal. But when we asked why his life was so good, he said that before the collective farm was established, his family often didn't know where the next meal was coming from and wore tattered clothes. However, since joining the collective farm, with everyone's active labor, the land yield has gradually increased, and life has gradually improved. He also told me that during the busy farming season, the members of the farm get up before dawn to work in the fields. He said: The members of our farm are very happy, but this is earned through hard work. I still remember this sentence today. Some people only hear that Soviet farm members eat bread and drink milk, and mistakenly think: our current life should be like this to show the superiority of advanced cooperatives. This way of looking at the problem is not appropriate. The Soviet collective farms have gone through a long journey of over thirty years, while our advanced cooperatives are only in their first year, and we have also encountered the worst floods in decades. Even if the advanced cooperative system is superior, wanting to catch up with the life of Soviet farmers without going through a period of hard struggle is an overly hasty demand and an unrealistic fantasy. As long as we work hard, run the cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and further exert the superiority of advanced cooperatives, life will gradually improve with the increase in production, and we will eventually reach the living standards of Soviet farmers.

    合作化是越走越宽的光明大道
            河北饶阳县五公乡农业社主任　耿长锁
    合作社的优越制度到底给五公乡农民带来了什么？一句话，它给我们带来了幸福生活，铲除了贫困和饥饿。旧社会的五公乡是个穷村庄，每当遇到灾荒的时候农民们多是携家带口东逃西散。可是自从1943年起，我们在党的领导下，一步一步地走上了合作化道路以来，生产水平和生活水平都有了很大的提高。在小农经济时代每亩地平均产量一百七十多斤，合作化后增到四百六十三斤（1955年）。去年虽然遭受几十年来没有的大水灾，每亩平均产量还有三百四十七斤。随着生产的提高，生活也一天比一天的好起来，住的穿的吃的都有了改善。五年来五公村新盖砖房一百零八间，穿破衣裳的再也不见了。从这些事实来看，合作制度是广大农民走向幸福的必由之路，也是越走越宽的光明大道，这点是无可怀疑的。
    有的人认为：高级合作化了，为什么还没吃上牛奶面包，因此就说高级社没优越性。对这个问题我也谈谈我的认识。1952年，我参观过苏联集体农庄（也就是现在咱们的高级社）。庄员们的确是吃面包，喝牛奶，顿顿饭有肉，住的瓦楼房，穿的好衣裳。但是，我要告诉大家，这种幸福的生活，不是从天上白白掉下来的，而是苏联农民三十多年来艰苦奋斗和努力劳动的成果。乌克兰共和国十月胜利集体农庄主席杜布可维茨基同志在我们参观的时候，领着我们参观了庄员瓦西利的家庭。这家共五口人，三个劳动力，1951年，全家得劳动日一千三百四十四个，共分了现款八千零六十四个卢布，粮食一百二十三普特，还有私有财产乳牛一头，产奶二千公升，可折合四千卢布，猪三只，可收入四千五百卢布，另外还有果木蔬菜等收入。他家的生活的确不错，顿顿是面包、牛奶和猪肉。可是当我们问到他的生活为啥这样好的时候，他说在过去没成立集体农庄以前，他家吃了上顿没下顿，穿的是破衣裳。可是自从参加集体农庄，在大家积极劳动下土地产量日渐提高，生活也就随着逐渐改善了。他还告诉我，农忙时庄员们天不亮就起床下地劳动。他说：我们农庄的庄员们是非常幸福的，但这是用艰苦劳动换来的。这句话直到今天我还牢牢记着。有些人光听说苏联庄员吃面包喝牛奶，就错误地认为：咱们现在的生活也应该如此，才算是高级社有优越性。这样看问题就有些不妥当了，苏联的集体农庄走过了三十几年的长远路程，而我们的高级社仅仅才是第一年，何况又遇到几十年来未有的大水灾呢？即便是高级社制度如何优越，要想不经过一段艰苦斗争，就想赶上苏联农民一样的生活，是要求过急和脱离实际的一种幻想。只要我们艰苦劳动，勤俭办社，进一步发挥高级社的优越性，随着生产的提高，生活是会逐渐改善的，将来是会达到苏联农民的生活水平的。
