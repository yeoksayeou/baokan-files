Comrades, Representatives, and Guests:

    The National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives is now open!

    Attending this conference are representatives of advanced figures in all aspects of agricultural production from all ethnic groups, provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and directly affiliated units across the country, and are the backbone of the agricultural production front. Thanks to the creative labor of the representatives, you have driven and helped the broad masses of farmers to advance victoriously on the road of socialist agricultural economic construction, and have achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements. On behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, I would like to extend a warm welcome and sincere respect to all representatives!

    Comrades! As early as the revolutionary war period, we held many regional labor model conferences in the revolutionary base areas at that time. After the nationwide liberation, we also held national labor model conferences in Beijing. Many of the representatives present have participated in these conferences more than once. However, the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives that opens today is convened under new conditions. Now, China's agricultural economy is no longer the individual small-scale peasant economy of the past, but a socialist collective economy. China's 500 million farmers are no longer individual farmers of small private ownership, but socialist collective farmers. This is a change of extremely great significance. Our National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives is the first national gathering of advanced figures on the socialist agricultural front under the conditions that agricultural cooperation has been realized nationwide. The significance of this conference is also very significant.

    The past year—1956—was a year of great victory for China's socialist construction and socialist transformation. From the agricultural point of view, two major upsurges emerged in 1956—the upsurge of agricultural cooperation and the upsurge of agricultural production. The upsurge of the socialist revolution in the rural areas of the whole country has promoted the acceleration of history. Within one year, agricultural cooperation was realized nationwide. Moreover, on the basis of cooperation, relying on the unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, various technical measures for increasing agricultural production were promoted on a large scale, thereby overcoming the floods, typhoons, and droughts that were even more serious than the disaster situation in 1954, and obtaining higher yields than the bumper harvest of 1955. Grain (including soybeans) increased by 20 billion catties compared with 1955, cotton was roughly the same as in 1955, and the output of various other industrial crops increased significantly compared with 1955. Compared with 1954, which suffered from floods, the increase in agricultural products was even greater. For example, grain (including soybeans) increased by 50 billion catties compared with 1954. This is a great achievement on the agricultural production front. The achievement of this achievement undoubtedly proves the superiority of socialist cooperation.

    Comrade Representatives! You are advanced figures in the management and operation of agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned agricultural and animal husbandry enterprises. You are advanced figures in water conservancy construction, accumulating fertilizer, popularizing fine varieties, improving soil, converting dry land into paddy fields, converting single cropping into double cropping, converting indica rice into japonica rice, converting low yield into high yield, improving cultivation techniques, and developing animal husbandry, aquaculture, and various sideline production. You are advanced figures in agricultural scientific research. In 1956, thanks to your enthusiastic efforts and the efforts of all farmers, very great achievements were made in promoting various technical measures and increasing the yield of crops. The expansion of irrigated area, the increase in fertilizer application, the growth of planting area of double-cropping rice and corn and sweet potatoes, the popularization of fine varieties, etc., have all greatly exceeded any previous year, and some have even exceeded the cumulative achievements of several years since liberation; although some problems have occurred in some places, 80% or so have been successful and increased production. There are also some that have some shortcomings that need to be improved but have not reduced production, and only a few examples have truly failed and thus reduced production. Mistakes and problems should, of course, be taken as lessons and efforts should be made to correct them. However, various effective technical measures for increasing production must be promoted more actively and in accordance with local conditions. The resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "The main way to increase agricultural production at present is to give full play to the superior conditions that agricultural cooperation has basically realized, rely on the collective strength of cooperatives and the support of the government, and take measures such as building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer application, improving soil, improving varieties, popularizing new agricultural tools, increasing the multiple cropping index, improving cultivation methods, and preventing and controlling diseases, pests, and disasters to increase yield per unit area." In 1956, these measures were taken to overcome serious disasters, and agriculture achieved significant increases in production. In the future, these measures must continue to be taken to increase crop yields. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967 requires that within twelve years, the average yield per mu of grain should reach 400 catties, 500 catties, and 800 catties respectively according to different regions, and the average yield per mu of cotton should reach 60 catties, 80 catties, and 100 catties respectively. This requirement should be achieved and can be achieved. Comrade Representatives of agricultural labor models! I hope that through this conference, you will exchange advanced experiences, further promote socialist enthusiasm and creativity, and according to the different conditions of various places, take the lead more actively in promoting various technical measures suitable for your region, and strive to gradually achieve the requirements put forward by the National Agricultural Development Program, and first strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1957.

    Striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1957, increasing the production of more grain, cotton, soybeans, oil crops, sugar crops, tobacco, hemp, silk, tea, and other agricultural crops, and increasing the production of more livestock products, aquatic products, forest products, and various sideline products are of great significance for further consolidating agricultural production cooperatives and consolidating the hard-won victory of socialist transformation of agriculture. At the same time, China is still an agricultural country, and agriculture accounts for a considerable proportion of the national economy. The food for 600 million people relies on agricultural supply; 95% of the raw materials needed for light industry production come from agriculture, and most of the light industrial products are also sold in the rural market; heavy industry also needs to rely on the development of agriculture to open up a broad market in the rural areas; 75% of the exported materials are agricultural and rural sideline products, and only with the export of agricultural products can heavy industrial equipment be exchanged. Therefore, the abundance or shortage of agricultural harvests is extremely related to the development speed of various sectors of the national economy. Striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1957 is also of great significance for various sectors of the national economy to overfulfill the first five-year plan to a greater extent and better prepare the foundation for the second five-year plan.

    Under normal years, striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1957 is entirely possible. Because:

    First, the advanced form of agricultural cooperation has basically been realized. In 1956, we devoted the greatest efforts to the work of cooperation, organizing tens of thousands of farmers into agricultural production cooperatives, and in 1957 we can concentrate more efforts on agricultural production work.

    Second, both in terms of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production, the experience of cadres and farmers has become richer after a year of great movement. This can make the future work less detours and fewer mistakes, and achieve greater achievements in agricultural production increase.

    Third, the emotions of the broad masses and cadres are still high, and they still show full enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm in winter production and preparation for cultivation. Protecting and continuing to promote their enthusiasm and initiative is a reliable guarantee for striving for a bumper harvest in 1957.

    Fourth, most provinces and regions had bumper harvests in 1956, and cooperatives already have a certain amount of public accumulation funds, which is completely different from the situation in 1956 when cooperatives were first established and production funds were very difficult. This has prepared better material conditions for the further development of agricultural production in 1957. In a few disaster-stricken provinces and regions, the lives of the victims have been properly arranged, the state has given necessary relief, and the collective strength of the cooperatives has been used to restore production, which is also more favorable than the era of individual operation in the past.

    Fifth, the state will continue to take various measures, such as issuing agricultural loans, supplying chemical fertilizers, and investing in water conservancy projects, to support agricultural production.

    With these favorable conditions, coupled with the strengthening of leadership by party and government leading organs at all levels from the central to the local levels, the entire party mobilized, and all cadres on the rural front and the broad masses of farmers worked together to run agricultural production cooperatives better in accordance with the principles of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and democratic management of cooperatives. As long as there are no particularly serious disasters, we will be able to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1957, thereby showing the superiority of socialist cooperation to a greater extent, further consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, and pushing forward China's socialist construction cause.

    Comrade Representatives! You come from the masses, and you have close ties with the broad masses of farmers. I hope you will not become arrogant because of your achievements and become detached from the masses. I hope you will further promote the democratic style and the style of the mass line, consult with the masses in everything, accept the supervision of the masses, maintain close contact with the masses, learn from the masses, thereby motivating the broad masses of farmers to work together to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1957.

    I wish the National Conference of Agricultural Labor Model Representatives a smooth success! I wish all representatives good health!

    在全国农业劳动模范代表会议上的开幕词
    农业部部长　廖鲁言
    各位代表、各位来宾：
    全国农业劳动模范代表会议，现在开幕了！
    出席这次会议的，是从全国各民族、各省、市、自治区和直属单位派来的农业生产各个方面的先进人物的代表，是农业生产战线上的骨干分子。由于各位代表同志们的创造性的劳动，带动了并且帮助了广大农民在社会主义农业经济建设的道路上胜利前进，获得了史无前例的辉煌成就。我谨代表农业部，向各位代表表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意！
    同志们！早在革命战争时期，我们就在当时的革命根据地中，开过许多次地区性的劳模会议，在全国解放以后，也在北京开过全国性的劳模会议，在坐的代表同志中间，有不少人曾经不止一次地参加过这些会议。但是，今天开幕的全国农业劳动模范代表会议，是在新的条件下召开的。现在，我国的农业经济已经不是过去那种个体的小农经济，而是社会主义的集体经济。我国的五亿农民已经不是小私有者的个体农民，而是社会主义的集体农民。这是一个意义极为伟大的变化。我们这次全国农业劳动模范代表会议，是在全国范围内已经实现农业合作化的条件下，社会主义农业战线上的先进人物第一次全国性的大集会，这次会议的意义也是很重大的。
    过去的一年——1956年，是我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的伟大胜利的一年。从农业方面看，1956年出现了两大高潮——农业合作化的高潮和农业生产的高潮。全国农村中社会主义革命的高潮，推动着历史加速前进，在一年的时间内，实现了全国范围的农业合作化。并且，在合作化的基础上，依靠广大农民的空前高涨的生产积极性，大规模地推行了农业增产的各种技术措施，从而战胜了比1954年的灾情还要严重的水灾、风灾和旱灾，获得了比丰收的1955年更高的产量，粮食（包括大豆）比1955年增产二百亿斤，棉花同1955年大体相平，其他各种工业作物的产量比1955年都有显著的增加。如果同遭受洪水灾害的1954年相比，农产品增加的数量更大，例如，粮食（包括大豆）比1954年增加五百亿斤。这是农业生产战线上的巨大成就。这一成就的获得，无可争辩地证明了社会主义合作化的优越性。
    各位代表同志们！你们是农业生产合作社和国营农牧企业的经营管理工作中的先进人物，你们是兴修水利、积肥造肥、推广良种、改良土壤、旱地改水田、单季改双季、籼稻改粳稻、低产改高产、改进耕作技术以及发展畜牧、水产和各种副业生产中的先进人物，你们是农业科学研究工作中的先进人物。在1956年内，由于你们和全体农民的热情努力，在推行各项技术措施、增加农作物的产量方面，获得了非常大的成绩。灌溉面积的扩大，施肥量的增加，双季稻和玉米、薯类的播种面积的增长，良种的推广等等，都大大超过了以往的任何一年，有的甚至比解放以来几年累计的成就还要大；尽管有的地方也出了一些毛病，但是，80％左右是成功的、增产的。还有一部分有些缺点，需要改进、并未减产，真正搞失败了、因而减产的例子只占百分之几。搞错了、出了毛病的，当然应该引为教训，努力改正。但是，各种行之有效的增产技术措施，则必须更积极地、因地制宜地努力推行。中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的决议指出：“目前农业增产的主要途径，就是要充分发挥农业已经基本上实现合作化这个优越条件，依靠合作社的集体力量和政府的支援，采取兴修水利、增施肥料、改良土壤、改良品种、推广新式农具、提高复种指数、改进耕作方法、防治病虫灾害等项措施，来增加单位面积产量。”1956年，采取了这些措施，战胜了严重的灾荒，农业获得了显著的增产。今后还必须继续采取这些措施，来增加农作物的产量。1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案），要求在十二年内，粮食每亩平均产量，按照不同地区，分别达到四百斤、五百斤、八百斤，棉花每亩平均产量分别达到六十斤、八十斤、一百斤。这个要求是应该达到，而且可能达到的。各位农业劳动模范代表同志们！希望你们通过这次会议，交流先进的经验，进一步发挥社会主义的积极性和创造性，根据各地不同的条件，更积极地带头推行适合于你们那个地区采用的各项技术措施，努力逐步实现全国农业发展纲要所提出的要求，并且首先为争取1957年农业的大丰收而奋斗。
    争取1957年农业大丰收，增产更多的粮食、棉花、大豆、油料作物、糖料作物、烟、麻、丝、茶和其他农作物，增产更多的畜产品、水产品、林产品和各种副业产品，这对于进一步巩固农业生产合作社，巩固农业社会主义改造的既得胜利，是有重大意义的。同时，我国直到现在还是一个农业国，农业在国民经济中占相当大的比重，六亿人民吃的东西靠农业供应；轻工业生产所需要的原料95％来自农业，轻工业品的大部分也在农村市场推销；重工业也要靠发展农业，来在农村中开辟广阔的市场；出口的物资的75％是农业和农村副业产品，有了农产品出口才能换进重工业的设备。因此，农业收成的丰歉对于国民经济各部门的发展速度关系极大，争取1957年农业大丰收，对于国民经济各部门更多地超额完成第一个五年计划，更好地为第二个五年计划准备基础，也是有重大意义的。
    在正常年景下，争取1957年农业大丰收，是完全可能的。因为：
    第一、高级形式的农业合作化已经基本实现。在1956年，我们曾经拿出最大的力量来搞合作化的工作，把上万万户的农民组织到农业生产合作社里面来，而在1957年就可以集中更多的力量来搞农业生产工作了。
    第二、无论在农业合作化方面和农业生产方面，经过一年来伟大运动的锻炼，干部和农民的经验都更加丰富了。这就可以使今后的工作少走弯路，少犯错误，而在农业增产上取得更大的成就。
    第三、广大群众和干部的情绪，仍然是高涨的，在冬季生产和备耕工作中，仍然表现出饱满的积极性和劳动热情，爱护和继续发扬他们的热情和积极性，就是争取1957年大丰收的可靠保证。
    第四、1956年大多数省区是丰收的，合作社已经有了一定的公积金，这同1956年合作社初成立、生产资金十分困难的情况完全不同了，这就为1957年的农业生产的进一步发展准备下更好的物质条件。少数受灾的省区，灾民的生活已经得到妥善的安排，国家给了必要的救济，而且用合作社的集体力量来恢复生产，比起过去个体经营的时代来，条件也更为有利。
  　第五、国家还继续采取各项措施，如发放农贷、供应化学肥料、水利工程投资，等等，来支援农业生产。
    有了这些有利条件，再加上从中央到地方各级党政领导机关的加强领导，全党动员起来，农村战线上的全体干部和广大农民大家动手，按照勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，把农业生产合作社办得更好，只要不遭受特别严重的灾害，就一定能够争取到1957年农业的大丰收，从而更大地显示出社会主义合作化的优越性，使农业生产合作社更进一步巩固起来，把我国社会主义建设事业更向前推进一步。
    各位代表同志们！你们是从群众中来的，你们同广大农民有密切的联系。希望你们不要因为有了成绩而骄傲起来，脱离群众。希望你们更进一步发扬民主作风和群众路线的作风，遇事同群众商量，接受群众的监督，密切同群众的联系，向群众学习，从而带动起广大农民，共同努力，为实现1957年农业大丰收而奋斗。
    祝全国农业劳动模范代表会议顺利成功！祝各位代表同志身体健康！
