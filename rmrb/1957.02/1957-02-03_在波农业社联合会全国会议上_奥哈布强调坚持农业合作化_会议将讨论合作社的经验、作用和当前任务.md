Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 2nd: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, Ochab, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Polish Minister of Agriculture, said that the Polish United Workers' Party and the government still consider the socialist transformation of the countryside to be the goal of the Party and the government, and the Party's policy has not abandoned agricultural cooperativization.

Ochab spoke on January 31st at the first national conference of heads of local branches of the Polish Agricultural Cooperative Federation held in Warsaw. The conference was convened to discuss the experiences, role, and current most important tasks of cooperative organizations.

In his speech, Ochab also said that the reason why many sound cooperatives were dissolved at the end of last year was not only due to past mistakes, but also largely due to the weakness of political activists who were unable to resist the pressure from hostile troublemakers. He said that the important thing at present is to learn from past mistakes, persistently create preconditions for socialist transformation in the countryside, and strive to win more people over to the idea of agricultural cooperativization. Assistance should be given to farmers who wish to establish agricultural cooperatives. Local branches of the Agricultural Cooperative Federation should work with the leading organs of the United Workers' Party and the United Peasant Party, as well as local people's congresses, to rebuild those well-managed cooperatives that were hastily dissolved.

Ochab also spoke in detail about the most important issues in increasing agricultural production.

When talking about the difficulties encountered by cooperative farmers, Ochab said that the government is focusing its efforts on studying the demands of cooperative farmers, and the government will do everything possible to create suitable conditions for the development of agricultural cooperatives.

    在波农业社联合会全国会议上
    奥哈布强调坚持农业合作化
    会议将讨论合作社的经验、作用和当前任务
    新华社华沙2日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员、波兰农业部长奥哈布说，波兰统一工人党和政府仍然认为农村的社会主义改造是党和政府的目标，党的政策并没有放弃农业合作化。
    奥哈布1月31日在华沙举行的波兰农业合作社联合会各地分会负责人第一次全国会议上讲了话。这次会议的召开是为了讨论合作社组织的经验、作用和当前最重要的任务。
    奥哈布在这次讲话中还说，去年年底许多健全的合作社之所以被解散，不仅是由于过去的错误，而且在很大程度上也是由于政治积极分子的软弱无能，他们没有能够抵抗住敌对滋事分子的压力。他说，目前重要的是要从过去的错误中汲取教训，坚持不懈地在农村中为社会主义改造创造先决条件，争取更多的人拥护农业合作化的思想。对于凡是希望建立农业合作社的农民，都应该给予协助。农业合作社联合会各地分会应该同统一工人党和统一农民党的领导机关以及当地的人民会议一道，努力重建那些经营良好而匆促解散的合作社。
    奥哈布还详尽地谈到增加农业生产方面的最重要的问题。
    奥哈布在谈到合作社农民所遇到的困难的时候说，政府正在集中精力研究合作社农民的要求，政府将尽一切力量为农业合作社创造适宜的发展条件。
