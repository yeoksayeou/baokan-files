Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 10th: Representatives of People's Congresses in many districts of Tianjin have adopted various ways to contact voters, publicizing policies to voters and listening to voters' opinions on government work, which has been warmly welcomed by the majority of voters.

    Many district people's representatives in the Hexi District have formed representative groups based on streets, adopting methods such as visiting voters, holding forums with voters, and setting up suggestion boxes and voter reception stations to contact voters. District people's representatives in streets such as Xiawafang, Donglou, and Qiandezhuang have also stipulated a system of contacting voters once a month. On the day of contacting voters, several representatives receive voters at the voter reception station, while other representatives go deep into the electoral districts to contact voters. District people's representatives in Wuma Road Street in the Nankai District have stipulated that the afternoons of the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month are voter reception days, with representatives taking turns receiving voters on these three days. They also go to electoral districts such as streets and factories from time to time to contact voters.

    Since the second sessions of the People's Congresses of various districts were convened for the first time, many district people's representatives have met with voters twice and accepted the opinions put forward by voters. District people's representatives in three streets, including Xiawafang in the Hexi District, collected more than 60 opinions in the two receptions, some of which were criticisms and suggestions on the work of government departments, and some were problems that voters themselves requested to be resolved. The representatives have written the opinions raised by the voters into written materials and reported them to the district people's committee and other relevant departments.

    河西区许多区人民代表以街为单位组成了代表小组，采取访问选民、和选民举行座谈以及设意见箱、选民接待站等方式联系选民。下瓦房、东楼、谦德庄等街的区人民代表并规定了每月联系选民一次的制度，在联系选民这一天，由几个代表在选民接待站里接待选民，其他代表则深入选区同选民联系。南开区五马路街的区人民代表规定每月5日、15日、25日的下午为接待选民日，代表们在这三天中轮流接待选民。他们还不定期地到街道、工厂等选区去联系选民。
