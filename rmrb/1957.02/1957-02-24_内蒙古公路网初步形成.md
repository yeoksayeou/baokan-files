The highway transportation business in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has developed rapidly. Since liberation, more than 11,000 kilometers of highways have been newly built and restored. Including the original ones, there are now more than 13,600 kilometers of highways. At present, the region's highway network has been initially completed, and all banners and counties are accessible by automobiles. The previously closed transportation conditions have undergone significant changes.

The highway of the Ik Zhao League extends west to Yinchuan in Gansu Province, south to Yulin in Shaanxi Province, north to Baotou, and east to Hohhot. It is expected that these highways can be completed this year. In addition, the Hohhot-Hailar highway, which is more than 1,400 kilometers long, has also been surveyed.
