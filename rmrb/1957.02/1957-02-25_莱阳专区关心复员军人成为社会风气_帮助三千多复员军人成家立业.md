Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 24th. Cadres and the masses in Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, have helped more than 3,750 demobilized soldiers get married in the past year, accounting for more than 40% of the original total number of unmarried demobilized soldiers.

Laiyang Prefecture is the region with the largest number of demobilized soldiers in Shandong Province. Party and government leading organs at all levels in this prefecture regularly conduct education among cadres and the masses to remember the source of happiness, and welcoming and caring for demobilized soldiers has become a social norm in this region. Whenever demobilized soldiers arrive in the countryside, local cadres and the masses promptly and properly resettle them, and also actively find partners for the unmarried, helping them to settle down and establish careers. Cadres and the masses in Fushan County regard this work as their glorious duty. The county originally had hundreds of unmarried demobilized soldiers, and half of them got married within a year.

Under the care of the local government and the masses, the demobilized soldiers have maintained the fine traditions of the People's Army and have become an important force on the agricultural front.

    莱阳专区关心复员军人成为社会风气
    帮助三千多复员军人成家立业
    据新华社莱阳24日电　山东省莱阳专区的干部和群众，一年来帮助三千七百五十多名复员军人结了婚，占原有未婚复员军人总数的40％以上。
    莱阳专区是山东省复员军人最多的一个地区。这个专区的各级党政领导机关经常向干部和群众进行饮水思源的教育，欢迎和关心复员军人已经在这个地区形成一种社会风气。每当复员军人到乡，当地干部和群众都及时地妥善安置他们，并且还积极地为未婚者找对象，帮助他们成家立业。福山县的干部和群众把这项工作当成自己的光荣义务。这个县原有未婚复员军人数百名，一年内就有半数人结了婚。
    在当地政府和群众的关怀下，复员军人保持了人民军队的优良传统，成为农业战线上的重要力量。
