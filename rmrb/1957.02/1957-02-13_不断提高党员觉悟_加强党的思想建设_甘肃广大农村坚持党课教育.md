    Continuously Improve Party Members' Awareness and Strengthen the Party's Ideological Construction
    Party Lesson Education Persists in Vast Rural Areas of Gansu
    (Our newspaper dispatch) In the past year, the work of educating Party members in rural areas of Gansu Province has shown significant development and improvement, and the ranks of Party lesson teachers in rural branches are gradually growing and forming. According to incomplete statistics from Tianshui, Pingliang, Zhangye, Yinchuan and other special districts, as well as Wu Zhong, Linxia, Gannan and other autonomous prefectures, more than 410 full-time Party lesson teachers have been assigned to branches (including five Tibetan Party lesson teachers). In addition, there are a considerable number of part-time Party lesson teachers. Tianshui, Wushan, Li County, and other counties have also selected one full-time Party lesson teacher and several part-time teachers per township based on specific circumstances. Now, most regions or branches in the province adhere to a regular system of Party lesson education. According to a survey of eleven counties and cities, including Wu Zhong, 80% of the branches adhere to a regular system of Party lesson education.
    Due to the development and adherence to a regular system of Party lesson education, the education of Party members in the Party's line and policies, as well as agricultural cooperativization, the National Agricultural Development Program (draft), and basic knowledge of communism and the Communist Party, has greatly improved Party members' interest in learning and their communist awareness, strengthened Party spirit, enhanced unity, corrected and overcome the main erroneous ideas and behaviors of Party members at various stages, and given relatively full play to the leading role of Party members in various tasks.
    The reason why the vast rural areas of Gansu are able to develop and adhere to a regular system of Party lesson education is mainly because Party committees at all levels have recognized the great significance of strengthening Party member education, which is to strengthen the Party's ideological construction, and have established the idea of relying on grassroots organizations and Party members to carry out work. Therefore, they have listed branch education as a regular and important task of the Party committee, strengthened ideological leadership over Party lesson education, and continuously criticized and overcome various erroneous understandings that ignore branch education.
    Secondly, it is because Party committees at all levels not only attach importance to the education of Party members ideologically, but also pay attention to the work of training Party lesson teachers and improving teaching quality. The main methods of training teachers are: 1. Establishing teaching and research groups, gathering regularly, and preparing lessons collectively; 2. Organizing teachers to participate in theoretical study, with the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee compiling lecture notes and printing reference materials; 3. Convening teacher seminars or holding Party lesson teacher training classes to exchange teaching methods and summarize and promote advanced experience; 4. Imparting teaching outlines to part-time teachers and instructors. In addition, in order to ensure the implementation of the teaching principle of combining theory with practice and to strengthen the combat effectiveness and ideological nature of Party lesson teaching, some branches have also attached importance to regularly understanding the ideological situation of Party members.

    不断提高党员觉悟　加强党的思想建设
    甘肃广大农村坚持党课教育
    本报讯　近一年来，甘肃省农村党员教育工作已有显著发展和提高，农村支部党课教员的队伍正在逐步壮大和形成。据天水、平凉、张掖、银川等专区和吴忠、临夏、甘南等自治州的不完全统计，已配备专职支部党课教员四百一十余人（其中有藏族支部党课教员五人）。另外，还有相当数量的兼职党课教员。天水、武山、礼县等县还根据具体情况，一乡选配了一名专职支部党课教员和若干兼职教员。现在，全省大部分地区或支部都坚持了经常的党课教育制度。根据吴忠等十一县、市的调查，有80％的支部坚持了经常的党课教育制度。
    由于开展和坚持了经常的党课教育制度，向党员进行了党的路线、政策及农业合作化、全国农业发展纲要（草案）和共产主义与共产党的基本知识的教育，大大地提高了党员的学习兴趣和共产主义觉悟，增强了党性，加强了团结，纠正和克服了党员在各个时期的主要错误思想与行为，比较充分地发挥了党员在各项工作中的带头作用。
    甘肃广大农村所以能够开展和坚持经常的党课教育制度，主要是由于各级党委认识了加强党员教育就是加强党的思想建设的重大意义，树立了依靠基层组织和党员进行工作的思想。因而，把支部教育列为党委经常的重要工作，加强了对党课教育的思想领导，不断地批判和克服了各种忽视支部教育的错误认识。
    其次，是由于各级党委不但在思想上重视了对党员的教育，而且注意了培养党课教员、提高教学质量的工作。培养教员的主要方法是：一、成立教研组，定期集中，集体备课；二、组织教员参加理论学习，由党委宣传部编写讲稿，印发参考资料；三、召集教员座谈会或举办党课教员训练班，交流教学方法，总结与推广先进经验；四、向兼职教员和辅导员传授教学提纲。此外，为了保证贯彻理论和实际相结合的教学原则，加强党课教学的战斗性与思想性，一些支部还重视了对党员思想情况的经常了解。　（李能良）
