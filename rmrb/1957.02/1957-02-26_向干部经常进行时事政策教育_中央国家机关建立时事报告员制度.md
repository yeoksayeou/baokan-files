    Conduct Regular Current Affairs and Policy Education for Cadres
    Central Government Departments Establish Current Affairs Reporter System
    (Our Newspaper) News: According to the instructions of the Party Committee of the Central Government Departments on establishing a current affairs reporter system and the decision to strengthen ideological work, the various units of the Central Government Departments have generally established a current affairs reporter system. By the end of December last year, 59 units had set up 1,252 reporters. The reporters are held by cadres at the level of division chiefs or section chiefs of various units. Currently, the work of reporters is being further developed.
    Some units of the Central Government Departments have carried out their work in a planned way after the establishment of the reporter system. For example, more than a dozen units, such as the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the Ministry of Forest Industry, have specifically convened reporter work meetings, formulated work plans, and determined necessary systems. They also provide reference materials for the reporters and begin to independently organize current affairs reports. Some units are still limited to conveying current affairs reports to cadres based on the current affairs reports organized by the higher-level Party Committee. The Party Committee of the Central Government Departments has successively made three special reports on major international issues to the reporters of various units, and the reporters went back to convey the reports after listening to them.
    Units where the work of reporters is done well are first and foremost because the leading cadres attach importance to this work and can personally guide it. The Party Committee Secretary of the Ministry of Forest Industry personally presided over the current affairs report meeting; the administrative leaders of the First Ministry of Machine Building called on the directors of each division and bureau to become natural current affairs reporters, and to include paying attention to the current affairs education of cadres as one of their duties. Secondly, these units organize reporters to carry out their work in a planned way, and the reporters have clear work tasks. For example, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry determined that the work tasks of the reporters are: to convey current affairs reports; to select topics, conduct research, and then make reports. This unit also selected six reporters to form a core group to study the content of the report. At the same time, these units also provide reporters with various convenient conditions.
    The Party Committee of the Central Government Departments is studying how to strengthen the work of reporters in various units. They regard this work as an important link in strengthening the political and ideological work of organ cadres, and require the Party Committees of various units to have a dedicated person to specifically grasp this work. Units that have already established reporter work should make this work regularized; those that have not yet established or have not started working after establishment should act immediately. They require the reporters of various units to make regular current affairs reports to the organ cadres. Units above the division and bureau level should generally do so once a month. In order to improve the quality of the reports, the units are also required to provide the reporters with research materials and documents, and organize supplementary forums.

    向干部经常进行时事政策教育
    中央国家机关建立时事报告员制度
    本报讯　中央国家机关各单位根据国家机关党委会关于建立时事报告员制度的指示和加强思想工作的决定，普遍建立了时事报告员制度。在去年12月底，已有五十九个单位设置了报告员一千二百五十二人。报告员由各单位司局长一级或处科长一级干部担任。目前报告员工作正在进一步开展。
    中央国家机关一部分单位的报告员设立以后已经有计划地进行了工作。如电力工业部、森林工业部等十几个单位都专门召开了报告员工作会议，制订了工作计划，确定了必要的制度。并且供给报告员参考资料，开始自行组织时事报告。一部分单位则还只限于根据上级党委组织的时事报告向干部作传达。中央国家机关党委会已经先后向各单位报告员作过三次重大的国际问题的专题报告，报告员在听了报告后即分别回去传达。
    凡是报告员工作做得好的单位，首先是因为领导干部重视这一工作，并且能亲自加以指导。森林工业部党委书记亲自主持时事报告会；第一机械工业部行政领导同志号召各司局长要成为当然的时事报告员，把经常注意干部的时事教育工作列为本职工作之一。其次，这些单位组织报告员有计划地进行工作，报告员有明确的工作任务。如电力工业部确定报告员的工作任务是：传达时事报告；选择专题，进行研究，然后作报告。这个单位还选择报告员六人组成了核心小组，研究报告的内容。同时这些单位还给报告员以各种方便条件。
    中央国家机关党委会正在研究如何加强各单位的报告员工作。他们把这一工作当作加强机关干部政治思想工作的重要环节，要求各单位党委会能有专人具体掌握这一工作。凡已经建立报告员工作的单位要使这个工作经常化；还没有建立或建立以后没有开始工作的应立即行动起来。他们要求各单位报告员能定期向机关干部作时事报告。各司局以上单位，一般最好每月一次。为了提高报告质量，还要求各单位给报告员提供研究的资料和文件，组织辅导性的座谈会等。
