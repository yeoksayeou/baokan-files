Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 4th: On the Qinghai Plateau, farmers of various ethnic groups living in mixed communities, united in production, fully demonstrating the superiority of the ethnic united agricultural cooperatives.

The over one thousand six hundred united cooperatives on the plateau, each composed of two to seven ethnic groups, were mostly established only last spring. Although they encountered natural disasters such as hail, frost, and mountain floods in their first year, grain production still increased by more than 10% compared to the bumper year of 1955. Many cooperatives saw large-scale high-yield records. Five united cooperatives located in areas over two thousand meters above sea level achieved an average yield of over six hundred jin per mu of highland barley or spring wheat, and two cooperatives achieved "thousand-jin mu" yields of spring wheat.

Over the past year, in addition to personally experiencing the benefits of organization in improving farming techniques, carrying out basic construction, and overcoming natural disasters, farmers of all ethnic groups have especially felt the necessity and benefits of joint cooperative management by various ethnic groups in areas of mixed ethnicity. Agricultural areas of Qinghai Province, where various ethnic groups live together, generally have more land than people, and mutual assistance and cooperation between ethnic groups alleviates the difficulty of insufficient labor. Tibetan and Mongolian farmers near Xiangride Town in the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, when working individually, had rough farming operations due to a lack of labor. Some wheat fields were not fertilized, and they couldn't bother with weeding even with weeds growing everywhere. Since forming the Unity Cooperative, they have unified labor allocation and improved farming techniques. The wheat fields have all been applied with base fertilizer and top dressing, watered three times each and weeded twice, so highland barley averaged 944 jin per mu, and wheat averaged 490 jin per mu, greatly exceeding the yield when working individually.

Collective production in ethnic united cooperatives has a relatively clear division of labor, which can give full play to the strengths of members of various ethnic groups and learn from each other. Many Tibetan, Tu, and Mongolian farmers, known for raising draft animals, became livestock keepers in the ethnic united cooperatives; Salar members, good at logging, were sent to sideline production teams to cut timber; and Han farmers, with better farming techniques, patiently helped brother ethnic members improve their skills. Members of all ethnic groups cooperate in one cooperative, learning from each other, which not only greatly improved production efficiency compared to individual work, but also gradually narrowed the gap in production technology and living standards among farmers of various ethnic groups.

In the ethnic united cooperatives, all ethnic groups have cadres participating in the cooperative's leadership, and the characteristics and customs of all ethnic groups are respected and cared for. Members of different ethnic groups overcome disasters and difficulties together on the basis of mutual equality and share the fruits of collective labor, thus greatly enhancing understanding and unity between ethnic groups. In the past, some areas had two ethnic groups discriminating against each other, and even within the same ethnic group, people often did not associate with each other due to different religious factions. Now, this phenomenon has been replaced by the unity and friendship generated by various ethnic groups sharing joys and sorrows. Datong County, which has seven ethnic groups including Tibetan, Han, Hui, Tu, Manchu, Mongolian, and Salar, has not had a single ethnic dispute case handled by county-level and township-level government agencies since the implementation of cooperation last spring. With increased ethnic unity, even small problems in ethnic relations can be properly resolved within the united cooperatives.

Currently, these ethnic united cooperatives are conducting rectification work, examining the implementation of ethnic policies, studying how to better implement the principles of ethnic equality, mutual respect for customs, and the majority ethnic members taking care of the minority ethnic members, to further consolidate ethnic unity and improve this year's production. A very small number of households that are still outside the cooperatives are now applying to join.

### 青海高原民族联合社办得很成功  民族团结日益增强，生产效率大大提高

    青海高原民族联合社办得很成功
    民族团结日益增强，生产效率大大提高
    新华社西宁4日电　青海高原上民族杂居地区的各族农民，团结生产，充分显示出了民族联合农业社的优越性。
    高原上一千六百多个分别由两个到七个民族组成的联合社，绝大多数是去年春天才建立的，在第一年虽然遇到冰雹、霜冻、山洪等自然灾害，但是粮食产量仍然比丰收的1955年增加一成多。许多社出现了大面积丰产纪录。有五个居住在拔海两千多公尺地带的联合社，每亩青稞或春小麦平均产量超过六百斤，两个社出现了春小麦的“千斤亩”。
    一年来，各族农民除了亲身体验到组织起来有利于改进耕作技术、进行基本建设和战胜自然灾害的优越性以外，特别感到民族杂居地区各民族联合办社的必要和好处。青海省民族杂居的农业地区，一般是地多人少，各民族互助合作便减少了劳力不足的困难。海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治州香日德镇附近的藏族和蒙古族农民在单干的时候，因为劳力缺乏，耕作经营很粗糙，有的麦田不施肥，麦草杂生也顾不上拔草。他们自从组成了团结社以后，统一调配劳力，改进耕作技术，麦田都施了底肥和追肥，普遍浇三次水，拔两次草，所以青稞平均每亩收获九百四十四斤，小麦每亩收获四百九十斤，大大超过了单干时的产量。
    民族联合社集体生产有比较明确的分工，能够发挥各族社员的特长，互相学习和提高。许多以饲养耕畜见长的藏族、土族和蒙古族农民，当了民族联合社的饲养员；长于伐木的撒拉族社员，便被派到副业生产队砍伐木材；汉族农民耕作技术比较好，他们耐心地帮助兄弟民族社员提高技术。各族社员在一个社里分工合作，互相学习，不仅使生产效率比单干时大大提高，也逐步缩短了各族农民在生产技术和生活水平上的距离。
    在民族联合社中，各民族都有干部参加社的领导，各民族的特点和风俗习惯都得到尊重和照顾。不同民族社员在相互平等的基础上共同战胜灾害和困难，分享集体劳动的果实，因而大大增强了民族之间的了解和团结。以前，有些地区的两个民族互相歧视，同一民族也常因为宗教派别不同而不相往来。现在这种现象已经被各民族在同甘共苦中产生的团结友爱所代替。有着藏、汉、回、土、满、蒙古、撒拉等七种民族杂居的大通县，自从去年春天实现合作化以来，县级和乡级政权机关就没有受理过一件民族纠纷的案件。民族团结增强了，即使民族关系上发生一些小问题，也能在联合社里得到妥善解决。
    目前，这些民族联合社正在通过整社工作，检查民族政策的执行情况，研究如何更好地贯彻民族平等、互相尊重风俗习惯、多数民族社员照顾少数民族社员的原则，进一步巩固民族团结和搞好今年的生产。极少数还留在社外的农户，现在也在申请入社。
