    Phouma States Only Way to Solve Laotian Political Problems is Through Negotiation

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th - According to Vietnam News Agency, Prince Souvanna Phouma, the Prime Minister of Laos, believes that the only way to solve the political problems of Laos is through negotiation, as stipulated in the Geneva Accords.

    The Laotian Prime Minister made these remarks in response to questions recently posed to him by a reporter from the Lao Press Agency.

    When the reporter asked Prince Phouma whether he was concerned that Western countries would stop or limit their aid to Laos, he said that he did not believe these countries would do so. He believes that doing so would clearly be interfering in the internal affairs of Laos.

    富马谈解决老挝政治问题
    唯一办法是通过谈判方式
    据新华社河内8日电　据越南通讯社讯，老挝首相梭发那·富马亲王认为，解决老挝政治问题的唯一办法就是像日内瓦协定所规定的那样，通过谈判的方式。
    这位老挝首相是在答复老挝新闻社记者最近向他提出的问题的时候说这番话的。
    记者问富马亲王，他是不是担心西方国家将停止或者限制它们给老挝的援助，他说，他不认为这些国家会这样做。他认为，这样做显然是干涉老挝的内政。
