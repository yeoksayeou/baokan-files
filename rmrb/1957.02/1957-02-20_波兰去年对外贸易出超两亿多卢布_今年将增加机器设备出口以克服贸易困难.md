Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 19th: According to Warsaw newspapers, Poland's total foreign trade value in 1956 reached over 7.5 billion rubles, an increase of nearly 2% compared to 1955. Among these, the total value of exports exceeded the total value of imports by over 200 million rubles.

In Poland's overall foreign trade last year, goods imported from socialist countries accounted for 62.2% of the total import value, and goods exported to these countries accounted for 58.7% of the total export value.

In terms of imports, the import of machinery and equipment fulfilled 87.8% of the plan last year, while the import plan for consumer goods was fulfilled 167%. The import of consumer goods increased significantly compared to 1955. In terms of exports, the proportion of machinery and equipment increased, while the proportion of agricultural products and consumer goods decreased. For example, agricultural products accounted for over 50% of the total export value in 1955, but this decreased to less than 12% last year.

Poland's export plan was only fulfilled by 94.9% last year due to a reduction of 4.5 million tons in coal exports and 370,000 tons in coke exports. On the other hand, because coal is still Poland's most important export commodity, the increase in international coal prices played a significant role in Poland's foreign trade surplus.

According to Mr. Gar, Chairman of the Polish Foreign Trade Association, Poland's foreign trade will encounter some difficulties in 1957. The main issue is that imports will increase substantially, while coal exports may be reduced due to the increase in domestic consumption and the planned reduction in production this year. The import-export trade deficit will be compensated by increasing the export of machinery, transport equipment, and steel.

Mr. Gar also stated that Poland hopes to continue developing trade with socialist countries in order to obtain all possible benefits from the production division of labor gradually forming within the socialist market. On the other hand, trade between Poland and capitalist countries, particularly less developed countries that need machinery and industrial products, will also increase.

    波兰去年对外贸易出超两亿多卢布
    今年将增加机器设备出口以克服贸易困难
    新华社华沙19日电　据华沙报纸报道，波兰1956年对外贸易总值达七十五亿多卢布，比1955年增加了将近2％。其中出口总值比入口总值多二亿多卢布。
    在整个波兰去年对外贸易当中，从社会主义国家入口的货物占入口总值的62.2％，向这些国家出口的货物占出口总值的58.7％。
    在入口方面，去年机器设备的入口完成了计划的87.8％，而消费品的入口计划则完成了167％。入口消费品比1955年有了很大的增加。在出口方面，机器设备的比重增加了，而农产品和消费品的比重减少了。例如，农产品在1955年出口总值中占50％强，去年则减到12％弱。
    波兰去年由于煤的出口削减了四百五十万吨，焦炭出口削减了三十七万吨，因而出口计划只完成了94.9％。另一方面，由于煤还是波兰最主要的出口物资，煤的国际价格的提高对于波兰对外贸易的出超起着很大的作用。
    据波兰对外贸易协会主席加尔指出，1957年波兰的对外贸易将遇到一些困难。主要是入口将有相当大的增加，而煤的出口则由于国内消费量的增加和今年计划产量的减少而可能削减，出入口贸易差额将依靠增加机器、运输设备和钢材的出口来弥补。
    加尔还表示，波兰希望继续发展同社会主义国家之间的贸易，以便从社会主义市场所逐渐形成的生产分工方面获得一切可能得到的好处。另一方面，波兰同资本主义国家、特别是需要机器和工业品的较不发达国家之间的贸易也将有所增长。
