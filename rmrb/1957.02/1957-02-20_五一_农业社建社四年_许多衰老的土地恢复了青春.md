Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th – The "May First" Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangshi Township, Rong County, Sichuan Province, recently assessed land grades during a contracting production process and discovered significant changes in the existing land grades. The cooperative has essentially eliminated over 300 mu of the poorest grade (丁) land. 47% of the formerly mediocre grade (丙) land has been upgraded to top (甲) and good (乙) grades. Previously, top and good grade lands only accounted for half of the total land area, but now they comprise two-thirds.

The "May First" cooperative is located in the hilly region of Shuangshi Township, where most of the land is sloping. In the past, individual farmers lacked the resources to implement soil and water conservation measures, leading to severe soil erosion and land degradation. After the establishment of the "May First" Agricultural Cooperative in 1953, land improvement was made a priority, with land processing carried out every spring and winter. They systematically thickened thin topsoil, improved poor soil, and removed rocks from the middle and surrounding areas of the land. Over the past four years, they have processed over 1,000 mu of land. They have also actively increased fertilizer application. The cooperative has increased the average number of pigs per household from less than one before its establishment to 1.7 pigs now, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased from 4,000 jin to over 5,700 jin. In addition, rational crop rotation and attention to soil fertility are carried out after continuous operation, and many aging lands have slowly regained their vitality. In the early days of the cooperative, there were 15 mu of scattered land on various hillsides that were in poor condition, only suitable for growing sweet potatoes and wheat in one season, and with very low yields. After years of processing and cultivation, these lands can now yield over 4,000 jin of sweet potatoes and over 280 jin of corn per mu. Previously uncultivable rapeseed and cotton can now be grown, and their yields are no lower than those of ordinary land.

    “五一”农业社建社四年
    许多衰老的土地恢复了青春
    新华社成都19日电　四川省荣县双石乡“五一”农业社最近在包工包产中评定土地等级时，发现原有土地的等级起了很大变化：全社三百多亩丁等土基本消灭了；47％的丙等土变成了甲等和乙等，甲乙丙等土原来只占总土地面积的一半，现在已经上升为三分之二。
    “五一”社所在的双石乡是个丘陵区，大部土地是坡土。过去，由于单干农民无力进行水土保持工作，水土流失现象很严重，许多土地一年不如一年。1953年“五一”农业社成立后，就把土地加工列为一项重要任务，每年春季和冬季都要进行一次土地加工工作。他们有计划地把表土层薄的土地加厚，土壤坏的改好，把土地中间和四周存有的乱石除去。四年来加工土地一千多亩。另外积极增加土地的施肥量。全社由建社前平均每户不到一头猪现在增加为一点七头猪，每亩土地施肥量由过去的四千斤增加为五千七百多斤。再加连片经营后进行合理轮作注意培养地力，许多衰老的土地便慢慢恢复了青春。这个社在建社初期有十五亩散落在各个山坡上的土地很坏，只能种一季红苕和小麦，而且收成很低，经过连年加工培养，现在这些土地种红苕每亩能收四千多斤，种玉米每亩能收二百八十多斤。过去不能种植的菜籽、棉花现在都能种植，而且产量不低于一般土地。
