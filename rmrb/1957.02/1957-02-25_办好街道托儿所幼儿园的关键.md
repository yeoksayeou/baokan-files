The mass-based street nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) are established by the masses themselves according to their needs. In recent years, these nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) have developed greatly in various places. It is understood that in 1956, 106 cities had carried out this work. According to incomplete statistics from only 17 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Anshan, there were 1,244 street nurseries and kindergartens, accommodating 42,810 children. They have played a certain role in supplementing the inadequacies of nursery organizations in factories, mines, government offices, and handicraft cooperatives, solving the childcare problems of female workers and female handicraftsmen, and helping working women from large families to care for and educate their children. For example, Nanjing City has a total of 167 mass-run nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes), accommodating 10,947 children, more than three times the total number of children accommodated in factory and government-run nurseries and kindergartens. This is a good proof.

The experience of various places in running mass-based street nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) proves that those who have done a good job generally grasped two main issues: First, they fully utilized the potential of the masses and society; second, they implemented the spirit of careful calculation, running the facilities diligently and frugally.

At present, the country is concentrating its main efforts on socialist construction and cannot allocate large amounts of funds to universally establish nurseries and kindergartens. Utilizing the manpower and material resources of the masses and all aspects of society, and advocating that the masses themselves run diverse, small-scale, simple mass-based street nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) is of considerable significance and effect. In recent years, the socialist consciousness of the people from all walks of life in the streets has been raised, and many of them are willing to support the establishment of street nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) to the best of their ability. In particular, the cadres of the street residents' committees and women's representative conferences have played an active role in promoting this. They have tried every means to overcome difficulties, actively mobilized the masses, and solved the problems of housing, utensils, and childcare personnel for the nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes). Many women's representative conference cadres and women representatives have repaired old houses themselves to use as sites for the nurseries and kindergartens. Some cadres or members of the public have lent unused furniture from their homes to the nurseries and kindergartens, and some have vacated surplus houses. For example, in Jifu Lane, Yulin District, Shanghai, residents from all walks of life, such as masons, carpenters, painters, and installation workers, engaged in voluntary labor during their spare time, together with the cadres of the residents' committee and the women's representative conference, to build several simple houses and establish three nurseries, kindergartens, and children's playgrounds. Simple and necessary furniture and equipment were also donated and borrowed by the masses voluntarily. In Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and other places, some family members of industrialists and businessmen have donated the fixed interest from their enterprises to help run nurseries and kindergartens. For example, in Tianjin, there are currently more than 20 nurseries and kindergartens run or co-run by family members of industrialists and businessmen and people from all walks of life, solving the childcare problems of more than 1,000 children. Some department stores, sewing cooperatives, printing factories, etc., also send unused cardboard boxes, small pieces of colored cloth, and scraps of paper to the nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) to make toys; maternal and child health stations in the neighborhood provide regular health check-ups for the children; public kindergartens provide guidance on children's education and teaching; and parents of children provide assistance in terms of manpower and material resources. All of this shows that if the masses need it, they will do their best to support it. The power of the masses is endless. As long as we are good at organizing and mobilizing these forces, we can promote the development of the childcare cause and solve the childcare problems of more working women.

Running mass-based nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) requires not only the full utilization of the power of the masses, but also the full mobilization of the enthusiasm and creativity of all staff members within the nurseries and kindergartens, the implementation of the spirit of careful calculation and thrift, and consideration for mothers and children in everything they do, so as to reduce fees, take good care of children, and consolidate and improve the nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes). The staff of street nurseries and kindergartens generally have a hardworking and thrifty style. They love the facilities as their own homes, are careful in their calculations, manage within their means, and try every means to solve various difficulties, and have accumulated some experience. They use waste paper from sugar and biscuit wrappers to fold paper crafts for children, sew cloth toys with scraps of colored cloth, and make various toys out of clay, enriching the children's games. Some make their own pastries and soy milk, and make their own tomato sauce in the summer for consumption in the winter, making the food both cheap and nutritious. They have also come up with many ways to save expenses. For example, the Third Nursery Station in Dongsi District, Beijing, uses coal dust to cover the fire in order to save coal, and picks out the burned coal. Originally, a small stove was used specifically for boiling water for the children, but later, the cook managed to adjust the fire in the large stove, freeing up space to boil water, reducing the number of stoves used for boiling water and saving 450 pounds of coal per month. Some have set up mezzanines, wall beds, and wall cabinets in the children's activity room to facilitate children's activities and improve the utilization rate of the house. In short, through their hard work and diligent research, those things that people regard as waste have become their teaching aids and children's toys; and dilapidated and simple houses have become clean and beautified environments. As a result, they have gained the trust of parents and the masses, as well as the attention and support of all sectors of society. This shows that as long as we can implement the spirit of thrift and find ways to overcome difficulties in our work, we can run nurseries and kindergartens well with less money.

However, some of our comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the full utilization of these positive factors and underestimate the creativity of the masses. A very small number of cadres do not dare to accept donations from enthusiastic people in society and do not dare to let go and let family members of industrialists and businessmen run nurseries and kindergartens. Therefore, they have not done a thorough and meticulous job of mobilizing the masses and striving for more people to care for and support nurseries and kindergartens, but simply emphasize that the state should provide more financial subsidies, believing that only in this way can the difficulties existing in mass-based nurseries and kindergartens be solved. Some even demand that the state take over everything. Others think that if they are to run the facilities, they must run them decently, and if they don't have money, they can't run them. Obviously, these ideas and practices that are not in line with the current situation are wrong. Some units and some comrades are not concerned enough about mass-based street nurseries and kindergartens and do not actively help them solve various difficulties. This attitude is also incorrect. In order to promote the consolidation and development of mass-based street nurseries and kindergartens, we must often care about the work of nurseries and kindergartens, strengthen business guidance and ideological education, and earnestly help the masses solve the specific difficulties in the facilities. Care for the work and life of the staff in childcare organizations and further improve their enthusiasm.

With the development of socialist construction, the number of employed women is increasing, and the need for this kind of mass-based nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) is becoming more and more urgent. The vast number of housewives, especially working women with large families, also demand the development of childcare organizations to help them manage and educate their children. Under this circumstance, we are also required to continue to give play to all the strength of the masses and society, carry forward the conscientious and hardworking work style of all staff members, mobilize all positive factors, and make the mass-based street nurseries (stations) and kindergartens (classes) more numerous, better, and more economical.

    办好街道托儿所幼儿园的关键
    中华全国民主妇女联合会  妇女儿童福利部部长  田秀涓
    群众性的街道托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）是根据群众的需要，由群众自行举办起来的。近年来各地这种托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）都有很大的发展。据了解，1956年已有一百零六个城市开展了这项工作，仅据北京、上海、鞍山等十七个城市的不完全统计，就有街道托儿所、幼儿园一千二百四十四处，收托儿童四万二千八百一十人。它们在辅助厂矿、机关、手工业合作社托儿组织的不足，解决女职工、女手工业者的孩子寄托问题和帮助多子女的家庭劳动妇女照管和教育孩子方面，都起了一定作用。例如南京市共有群众自办的托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）一百六十七所，收托儿童一万零九百四十七人，超过工厂、机关托儿所、幼儿园所收儿童总数的三倍以上，这就是很好的证明。
    各地举办群众性街道托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）的经验证明，凡是工作开展得好的，一般都抓住了两个主要问题：一是充分发挥了群众和社会上的潜力；二是贯彻了精打细算，勤俭办所、办园的精神。
    目前国家正在集中主要力量进行社会主义建设，不可能抽出大量经费来普遍举办托儿所和幼儿园，利用群众和社会上各方面的人力物力，提倡群众自行举办多种多样的、小型简便的群众性街道托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班），是有相当重要的意义和作用的。几年来，街道各阶层群众的社会主义觉悟都有所提高，其中有很多人愿意尽自己可能的力量，支持举办街道托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）；尤其是街道居民委员会和妇代会的干部，在这方面起了积极的推动作用。她们想尽各种办法克服困难，积极动员群众力量，解决托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）的房子、用具和保育人员等问题。不少妇女代表会干部、妇女代表自己动手将破旧的房子修好当做所址、园址，有的干部或群众将自己家中不用的家具借给托儿所、幼儿园使用，有的将多余的房子让出来。如上海市榆林区集福里，泥水匠、木匠、粉刷工人、安装工人等各行各业的居民，他们在工余时间，和居民委员会、妇代会干部一起从事义务劳动，修建了数间简单的房子，举办了托儿所、幼儿园和儿童乐园共三处。简单必要的家具设备，也都是群众自动捐、借出来的。天津、上海、重庆等地，都有些工商业者家属捐出企业的定息，协助举办托儿所、幼儿园。如天津市目前由工商业者家属、社会人士举办或参加举办的托儿所、幼儿园就有二十余处，解决了一千多名儿童的寄托问题。还有些百货公司、缝纫社、印刷厂等把不用的纸盒、小块花布、碎纸条等送给托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）做玩具；地段上的妇幼保建站为孩子们做定期的健康检查；公立幼儿园在儿童教育与教学业务上给以辅导以及儿童的家长从各方面给以人力物力的协助等等。这些都说明了群众需要它，群众就会尽自己的力量来支持它。群众的力量是无穷无尽的，只要我们善于组织和发动这些力量，就能够使托儿事业向前发展，使更多的劳动妇女的孩子寄托问题得到解决。
    举办群众性的托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班），不仅要充分发挥群众的力量，还需要托儿所、幼儿园内部全体工作人员充分发挥积极性与创造性，贯彻精打细算、勤俭节约的精神，处处为母亲、为孩子着想，做到降低收费，带好孩子，使托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）得以巩固提高。街道托儿所、幼儿园的工作人员一般的都具有刻苦工作、勤俭朴素的作风，她们爱所、爱园如家，精打细算，量入为出，想尽各种办法来解决各种困难，并且积累了一些经验。她们利用包糖包饼干的废纸给孩子折纸工，用碎花布缝制布玩具，用泥捏成各种玩具，丰富了孩子们的游戏内容。有的自制糕点、豆浆，在夏季自制西红柿酱，备冬季食用，使伙食既便宜又有营养。在节约经费开支方面也想了很多办法。如北京市东四区第三托儿站为了节约用煤，都是用煤末盖火，并且把烧过的煤拣净。原来用一个小炉子专门为孩子烧开水，后来炊事员把大灶的火设法调剂了一下，就有空烧开水了，减少了一个烧开水的炉子，每月可节省四百五十斤煤。有的为了便利儿童的活动，又提高房子的利用率，在儿童活动室内设置搁楼、壁床、壁橱。总之，通过她们的辛勤劳动和刻苦钻研，那些被人们视为废物的一丝一缕，就变成了她们的教具和孩子们的玩具；破旧简陋的房院，变成整洁美化的环境。因而得到了家长和群众的信任，也得到了社会上各方面的重视与支持。这说明，只要我们能贯彻勤俭节约的精神，在工作中想办法克服困难，用少花钱的办法，同样可以办好托儿所和幼儿园。
    可是我们还有些同志，对充分运用这些积极因素认识不够，对群众的创造性估计不足，还有极少数干部不敢接受社会热心人士的捐助，不敢放手让工商业者家属举办托儿所、幼儿园。因此没有深入细致地做好发动群众的工作，争取更多的人来关怀和支持托儿所、幼儿园，却单纯地强调国家要给以更多的经费补助，认为只有这样，才能解决群众性托儿所、幼儿园存在的困难。有的甚至要求国家包下来。也有的认为要办，就得办个像样的，没有钱，办不成。显然，这种不符合当前实际情况的想法和做法都是错误的。有些单位和有些同志对群众性街道托儿所、幼儿园不够关心，没有积极主动地帮助她们解决各种困难问题，这种态度也是不正确的。为了促进群众性街道托儿所、幼儿园的巩固和发展，我们必须经常关怀托儿所、幼儿园的工作，加强业务指导、思想教育，认真地帮助群众解决所、园内的具体困难。关怀托儿组织中工作人员的工作和生活，进一步提高她们的积极性。
    随着社会主义建设的发展，妇女就业人数日益增多，对这种群众性的托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）的需要也越来越迫切；广大的家庭妇女，尤其是多子女的家庭劳动妇女也要求发展托儿组织来帮助她们管教孩子。在这种情况下，也就要求我们要继续发挥群众和社会上一切力量，发扬全体工作人员那种兢兢业业、克勤克俭的工作作风，调动一切积极因素，使群众性街道托儿所（站）、幼儿园（班）办得又多、又好、又省。（附图片）
