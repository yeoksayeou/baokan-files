    Man with a Manure Basket

    One day, Qi Fenglou, the head of Lianggezhuang Township in Changli County, Hebei Province, carried a manure basket from his home to the township People's Committee to work. Along the way, he picked up manure as he walked. Old man Ren Xilun discovered this and was greatly surprised. He thought: The township head is so busy with work, yet he still picks up manure himself. How can I not pick it up? He ran home and also picked up a manure basket. Three days later, the majority of the cadres in this township had picked up manure baskets. A mass upsurge of manure accumulation quickly swept through the township. In less than twenty days, more than 450,000 jin of manure were collected.

    Before this, the streets of Lianggezhuang were full of cow dung and pig manure, but no one picked it up. Young commune members thought: Now that the family business is big, who cares about those two droppings of manure! Some older people did not think that way. They said, "Farming without manure is like blindly messing around." Therefore, they were very critical of the township and commune cadres for only promoting manure accumulation to the masses without doing it themselves. Some old farmers looked at them askance and discussed: This is outrageous! We work hard all year round, and they ride around in cars enjoying themselves. Whose money is that?

    After Qi Fenglou discovered this problem, he took the lead in picking up manure. This action was extraordinary: In the past, shouting "accumulate manure" ten thousand times did no good, but now that the township head picked up a manure basket, he motivated all the cadres and commune members in the township. In the past, when the cadres of Lianggezhuang went to the area to hold meetings, there was a long line of cars. Now, when they hold meetings, there is a long line of manure baskets. ·Shao Fei·

    背粪筐的人
    一天，河北昌黎县梁各庄乡的乡长齐凤楼，背着粪筐由家到乡人民委员会去办公。他一路上，边走边拾粪。任锡伦老汉发现了，大为惊讶。他想：乡长工作那么忙，还动手拾粪，自己怎能不拾呢？他跑回家去，也背起了粪筐。三天以后，这个乡的大多数干部都背起了粪筐。全乡迅速掀起了群众性的积肥热潮。不到二十天，就拾粪四十五万多斤。
    在这以前，梁各庄的街道上，到处是牛屎猪粪，却没有人去拾。年青的社员认为：现在家大业大了，谁还在乎那两泡粪！一些老年人却不那样想，他们说：“种地不上粪，等于瞎胡混。”因此，他们对乡、社干部只向群众宣传积肥而自己却不动手，很有意见。有些老农斜着眼睛看他们，并纷纷议论：这还像话！咱们一年到头辛辛苦苦，他们骑着车子兜风，谁的钱？
    齐凤楼发觉这一问题后，就首先带头拾粪。这一行动，非同小可：过去喊一万声积肥，却不顶一点事，现在乡长背起了粪筐，就带动了全乡干部和社员；以往，梁各庄的干部到片上开会的时候，是车子一排一大溜，如今开会，则是粪筐一摆一大溜。　·少飞·
