    On the Eve of the Spring Festival in Glorious South Village
    On the afternoon of the 28th, Zhang Fengbo, Deputy Mayor of Xi'an, and representatives of farmers visited the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel residing in Glorious South Village in the suburbs of Xi'an. This village was built by the People's Government in 1953 specifically for impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel and currently houses seventy-one families. When the visiting group arrived, the village was filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and the square was crowded with joyous people. Men, women, old, and young warmly greeted Deputy Mayor Zhang and the farmer representatives, and even the elderly women in their fifties and sixties happily started performing the Yangko dance.

    In a neatly and cleanly arranged conference room, the families of martyrs and military personnel sat together with Deputy Mayor Zhang and the farmer representatives. Huang Hongtao, a family member of a military person, first excitedly introduced the production and living conditions of the families of martyrs and military personnel in the village: The batting production group, established in February 1954 with government funding, has now developed into a batting production cooperative with more than forty members. In 1954, the members used handcarts to transport the raw materials themselves. Now, each time they import raw materials, it amounts to tens of thousands of pounds, transported from Qingdao, Shanghai, and other places to Xi'an. The cooperative's production has been increasing year by year. Last year, new workshops were built, production equipment was improved, and the income of the members increased more than threefold compared to 1954. At the end of last year, each person received an average dividend of more than thirty yuan. All sixty-odd military families in the village, except for a few without labor power, voluntarily requested the government to cancel their living subsidies. Deputy Mayor Zhang asked with concern about the raw materials and sales channels of the cooperative. Huang Hongtao replied, "There are absolutely no problems."

    The raw materials needed by their cooperative are helped to be resolved by the Shaanxi Provincial Production and Procurement Department; the products are given priority purchase by the shoe-making production cooperative. Just as Huang Hongtao finished speaking, the white-bearded old men and white-haired old women eagerly chimed in, expressing their gratitude for the care and help of the Party and the People's Government. At this time, Liu, an elderly mother of a martyr, aged sixty-eight, went home and brought a basket of steaming buns, placing it in front of Deputy Mayor Zhang, picking out a sugar-filled one and inviting the mayor to taste it. She said with a beaming smile, "Deputy Mayor Zhang, we are now sweet in our hearts." Everyone knew this old mother well; her only son had gloriously sacrificed his life on the Korean battlefield more than three years ago. The old mother is now spending a happy old age. The People's Government gives her a living allowance every month, plus her income from participating in batting production, her life is quite good. Before this year's Spring Festival, the People's Government also sent her a new quilt and a new piece of clothing. The cooperative distributed more than twenty yuan of bonus money to her at the end of the year. Today, she just returned from buying meat and vegetables, preparing a rich New Year's Eve dinner.

    Everyone finished talking. Deputy Mayor Zhang personally went to visit the homes of some of the families of martyrs and military personnel. Each family was filled with the special atmosphere of the approaching Spring Festival. In the home of Chen, an elderly mother of a military person, the stove was burning hot, the room was very warm, and the meat soup simmering in the pot exuded a fragrant aroma. Mother Chen was making dumplings to prepare for the New Year. Before her hometown was liberated, because her eldest son joined the revolution, Mother Chen suffered persecution from Kuomintang secret agents and fled from Jiangsu to Xi'an, living in a cave dwelling and living a life of begging for several years. After liberation, the People's Government helped her find her son in the People's Liberation Army and invited her to live in Glorious South Village in 1953. Now, the house she lives in has bright glass windows, plenty of sunlight and air, and is complete with furniture, bedding, and daily necessities. Her youngest son is also attending elementary school. Mother Chen said very emotionally to Deputy Mayor Zhang, "I was a beggar in the old society, but now the mayor personally comes to visit me. It is such an honor to be a family member of a military person!"

    The families of martyrs and military personnel invited Deputy Mayor Zhang to visit their square. More than two hundred trees were planted in this square, which was the work done by the Young Pioneers of the affiliated elementary school of Xi'an Normal School to green Glorious South Village last year. Every year, the families of martyrs and military personnel in Glorious South Village receive many guests who come to visit them. Last year, they received several hundred people, including students, members of agricultural production cooperatives, and residents. As soon as the guests arrive, they help them sweep the floor, carry water, and write letters, and also send many gifts to show their respect to the families of martyrs and military personnel. Some Young Pioneers gave away their precious red scarves; students sent portraits of Chairman Mao and peace doves they made themselves, and members of agricultural production cooperatives sent vegetables they grew themselves. Last year, eleven students from the affiliated elementary school of Xi'an Normal School specially chose to hold a solemn Young Pioneer joining ceremony here, inviting the grandfathers and grandmothers of military families to tie the red scarves for them.

    春节前夕在光荣南村	新华社记者　黄成
    28日下午，西安市副市长张锋伯和农民代表们慰问了聚居在西安市郊光荣南村的烈、军属。这个村庄是人民政府在1953年专为贫苦的烈、军属而修建的，现共住着七十一户人家。慰问组来到时，村里锣鼓喧天，广场上挤满了喜气洋洋的人群，男女老幼都亲热地和张副市长以及农民代表等互相问好，连五、六十岁的老太太也高兴得扭起秧歌来了。
    在一间布置得整齐又干净的会议室里，烈、军属们围着张副市长和农民代表坐在一起。军属黄洪涛首先激动地介绍了村中烈、军属的生产和生活情况：这个村的烈、军属在1954年2月靠政府资金成立的打褙子生产小组，现在已发展成一个拥有四十多个社员的褙子生产合作社了。1954年，他们买原料是社员用架子车自己推回来，现在每次进的原料，都是一两万斤，从青岛、上海等地运到西安来。社里的生产是一年比一年提高了。去年，新盖了工房，改善了生产设备，社员收入比1954年增加了三倍多。去年年终分红时，每人平均就分得三十多元。全村六十多户军属，除了个别没有劳动力的人，都自动要求政府取消了生活补助费。张副市长关切地问到社里的原料、销路问题，黄洪涛回答说：“完全没有问题。”
    他们社里所需要的原料，由陕西省生产品采购部门帮助解决；产品都是制鞋生产合作社优先收购。黄洪涛刚刚谈完，白胡子的老公公、白发的老大娘都争着谈起来，他们感激党和人民政府的关怀和帮助。这时，六十八岁的烈属刘老妈妈走回家去，端了一笼热腾腾的包子放在张副市长面前，拣了一个糖馅的请市长尝尝。她笑迷迷地说：“张副市长，现在我们是甜在心里头哩。”大家都熟识这位老妈妈，她的独生子在三年多以前光荣牺牲在朝鲜战场了。老妈妈现在度着幸福的晚年。每月人民政府给她生活补助费，加上她参加打褙子生产的收入，生活过得满好。今年春节前，人民政府又送她一床新被子和一件新衣服。社里年终分给她二十多元红金。今天，她刚割肉买菜回来，正准备着丰盛的年夜饭。
    大家谈完了。张副市长就亲自到一些烈、军属的家庭里去慰问。各家都充满了春节将临时特有的气氛。在军属陈老妈妈的家里，炉子火烧得热呼呼地，房里很温暖，锅子里炖的肉汤散发出香喷喷的气味，陈老妈妈正在包饺子准备过年。陈老妈妈在家乡还没有解放时，因为大儿子参加了革命，遭到国民党特务迫害，就从江苏流落到西安，住在窑洞里，过了几年讨饭的生活。解放后，人民政府帮助她找着在人民解放军里的儿子，1953年请她住进了光荣南村。现在，她住的这间房子，有明亮的玻璃窗，阳光和空气充足，家具、被褥和日用品都齐全，她的小儿子也上小学读书了。陈老妈妈非常感动地对张副市长说：“我在旧社会里是个要饭的，但现在市长亲自来慰问我，军属是多么光荣！”
    烈、军属们请张副市长参观了他们的广场。在这广场上种了二百多棵树，这是去年西安市师范学校附属小学的少先队员们为了绿化光荣南村而做的工作。每年，光荣南村的烈、军属们都要接待许多前来慰问他们的客人。去年，他们曾接待过学生、农业生产合作社社员、居民等好几百人。客人们一来，就帮助他们扫地、挑水、写信，还送了许多礼物表示对烈、军属的敬意。有些少先队员赠送了自己珍贵的红领巾；学生们送了自己制作的毛主席像、和平鸽，农业生产合作社社员送了他们自己种植的蔬菜。去年，西安市师范学校附属小学有十一个学生，特选择这里举行了庄重的少先队的入队仪式，请军属爷爷和奶奶们替他们戴上了红领巾。
