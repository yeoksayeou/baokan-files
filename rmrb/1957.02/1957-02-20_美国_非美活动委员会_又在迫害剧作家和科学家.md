　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: A U.S. federal grand jury indicted the famous American playwright Arthur Miller on the 18th for so-called "contempt of Congress."

　　Arthur Miller is the husband of American actress Marilyn Monroe. Miller's "crime" stems from his refusal in June 1956 to reveal to the House Un-American Activities Committee the names of writers who had attended meetings of American Communist Party organizations with him.

　　The federal grand jury that indicted Miller also indicted Dr. Otto Nathan on the same charge. Nathan is the executor of the estate of the late great scientist Albert Einstein and is currently an associate professor at New York University. One of the questions Nathan refused to answer was whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party.

    美国“非美活动委员会”
    又在迫害剧作家和科学家
    据新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国联邦大陪审团18日控诉美国著名剧作家阿塞·米勒犯有所谓
  “藐视国会罪”。
    阿塞·米勒是美国女演员马里林·门罗的丈夫，米勒因为在1956年6月间拒绝向众议院非美活动委员会说出曾经同他在一起参加过美国共产党组织的会议的作家的名字而构成这项“罪状”的。
    对米勒提出起诉的联邦大陪审团还以同样的罪名对奥托·内森博士提出起诉。内森是已故的大科学家爱因斯坦遗产的执行人，现任纽约大学副教授。内森拒绝答复的问题之一是他曾否参加过共产党。
