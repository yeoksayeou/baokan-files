Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th - A large number of paleontological fossils have been discovered in Jiagou, Caocun, Zhangshan, and other places in Huaibei, Bengbu Special District, Anhui Province. Among those already excavated are fossils of ancient elephants, giant beavers, and Père David's deer, among other ancient vertebrate fossils.

Over the past three months, more than 20,000 jin of fossils have been discovered in these areas. These paleontological fossils are of great significance for the study of paleontology, geology, and stratigraphy, and especially provide important data for studying the relationship between the animal groups of the Yellow River basin and the Huai River basin.

According to investigations by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Anhui Provincial Museum, preliminary identification based on strata and fossils suggests that these fossils are from the end of the Quaternary Ice Age in China.

    安徽发现大量古生物化石
    据新华社合肥19日电　安徽省蚌埠专区淮北的夹沟、曹村、张山等地发现大量的古生物化石。现在已清理出的有古象、巨河狸、四不像等古脊椎动物化石。
    三个月来，这些地区已发现了两万多斤化石。这些古生物化石对研究古生物学、地质学、地层学都有很大意义，特别是为研究黄河流域至淮河流域动物群的关系提供了重要资料。
    据中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室和安徽省博物馆的调查，根据地层与化石初步鉴定，这些化石是我国第四纪冰期末期的古生物化石。
