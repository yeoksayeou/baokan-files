    Zoo Nocturne	Tan Bangjie
    Visitors to the zoo are often disappointed to see the animals sleeping soundly. Some may think: These beasts have nothing to do all day but eat and sleep. There is some truth to this idea, but more importantly, most wild animals are "nocturnal." In the wild, they maintain their habit of being active at night and sleeping during the day. After coming to the zoo, although they have changed some of their habits due to changes in the environment, some deeply ingrained habits cannot be easily changed. Therefore, there are still many kinds of wild animals (especially carnivores) in the zoo that conserve their energy during the day and become active at night.

    People living in the zoo have more opportunities to see them active and hear their unconstrained voices when the night is quiet. Zoo workers often call this voice "Zoo Nocturne."

    But lions are an exception. Lions, who are used to "roaring," roar at night, and often during the day. This is different from their wild brothers living in the African wilderness. Originally, very few lions kept in zoos came from the wild. Because of easy breeding, if you want to trace the wild ancestry of the lions in the zoo now, it is less in tens of generations, and more probably in more than a hundred generations. As the years have passed, their habits have changed more. Their adaptability to the environment has increased, and their vigilance towards humans has relatively decreased.

    Tigers are different. It is rare to hear a tiger roar during the day. Tigers are more difficult to breed in zoos, so most come from the mountains and fields, and their daily activities generally maintain their original patterns. Only at dusk does this big bug look energetic, pacing back and forth, and occasionally let out a long roar from deep in its throat.

    There are also some differences in the expression of tiger roars and lion roars. The lion's roar is full of masculine, strong, and rough spirit. It is really like thunder, making people feel frightened. On the other hand, the tiger's roar is a deep and somber sound. Hearing this roar from afar in the dark mountains at night will surely make the listener's hair stand on end. Hearing it in the zoo, of course, there is no fear, but it is inevitable to feel a little sad and penetrating at first, but after getting used to it, you feel that there is a rather moving meaning of grief and admiration in it.

    Leopards rarely make a sound, and even when they do, there is nothing moving about it. Even the mating call during the breeding season is difficult to call pleasant. The sound is rough, hoarse, and short, a bit like sawing wood. I remember the first time I heard a leopard calling like this, I thought it had some strange disease. Later, after research, I learned that it was "lovesickness"!

    The most moving, I think, is the wolf howl. It is truly a gloomy, desolate, long, and sad sound. Listening to several wolves howling one after another in the deep, quiet night easily reminds people of the saying "a hundred ghosts crying at night." Although no one has ever heard ghosts crying, the ancients' connection of wolf howls with ghost cries is indeed a wonderful idea! I don't know how many nights I have been awakened from my dream by that desolate howling, unable to fall asleep for a long time.

    Wolves like to howl at night, especially on winter moonlit nights. Zoologists certainly know that it is the wolf's mating season, but many writers also understand it. Speaking of wolf howls, one cannot help but recall that scene in Jack London's "The Call of the Wild." In that remote Alaskan wilderness, on a bleak snowy night, the long howl of a female wolf in heat came from afar, strongly luring the dog Buck. He hesitated and hesitated, one side being loyalty and love for his master, and the other being the irresistible temptation from the wilderness. In the end, the wolf howl awakened the wolf ancestor's nature flowing in his blood, and he ran to the distant horizon to chase the wolf pack.

    Thinking of this, even that ghost-like howl seems a bit cute!

    Contrary to beasts, few birds sing at night. The nightingale, so charmingly portrayed by great poets such as Shakespeare, Shelley, and Milton, is neither produced in China nor kept in zoos, so there is no way to know what kind of nocturne it sings. But here I also think of a kind of bird we have, that is, the oriole whose feathers are bright yellow, like a golden bird. In the chilly April, it brought me so much joy of spring. It is a bird that wakes up especially early. It is still dark, long before dawn, and two orioles sing to each other. The singing is so clear and loud, so full of ups and downs and melody, and so dramatic in duet, I think it must be no less than the nightingale. I don't know if Mr. Meng Haoran's "Spring sleep does not feel dawn, everywhere you hear birds singing" refers to the oriole (I think it is very likely), but my spring sleep is often awakened by the singing of the oriole in a daze. Unfortunately, it is difficult for orioles to live long in cages. Even if a small one is lucky enough to survive the winter, it often dies in the spring. Outside the cage, the peach blossoms are red and the willows are green, and the orioles returning from the south are singing about love. This may be too stimulating for it.

### 动物园的夜乐

    动物园的夜乐	谭邦杰
    游动物园的人常常因为只看见动物抱头大睡而感到失望。有些人可能这样想：野兽们成天吃饱了没事干，只好抱头大睡吧。这种想法固然也有一部分道理，但更主要的还是由于大多数野兽都属于“夜行性”。在野外，他们保持着昼伏夜出的习惯，来到动物园后，虽然因环境改变而把习惯也改变了一些，但某些根深蒂固的习性是不能轻易改变了的。因此动物园里还有许多种野兽（尤其是猛兽类），白天养精蓄锐，一到晚上就活泼起来。
    住在动物园里的人，每当夜深人静之时，有更多的机会看见它们活动，并能听见它们无拘束的呼声。动物园工作者常常把这呼声称为“动物园的夜乐”。
    但狮子是一个例外。惯于做“狮子吼”的狮子，夜间固然吼，白天也常常吼。这却是和住在非洲原野上的野生兄弟们不同的。原来动物园里养的狮子极少来自野外。由于繁殖容易，现在动物园里的狮子，若要追溯它的野生血统，少的几十代，多的恐怕要在百代以上。年代既久，习性便也改得较多。它们对于环境的适应性越来越增加，对于人类的警惕性也就相对地越来越减低了。
    老虎则不同。在白天很少听得见虎啸。虎在动物园里繁殖较难，故多数来自山野，日常的行动也大抵保持着原来的规律。每到傍晚时刻，才见这条大虫精神奕奕，往来踱步，时而由喉咙深处吐出一声长啸。
    虎啸和狮吼，在表现上也颇有些区别。狮吼中充满了阳性的刚强粗暴的气概，真是声如劈雷，令人听了惊心动魄。反之，虎啸是一种深沉森郁的发音。在黑夜的深山里，远远听见这种啸声，必然使听者为之毛骨悚然。在动物园里听见，固然谈不到什么害怕，但乍听也难免感觉有点凄凉沁人，而听惯了之后，反倒觉得其中有一股相当动人的如悲如慕的意味。
    豹更少出声，就是出声，也没有一点动人之处。甚至在发情时节的求偶鸣声，也是很难称做悦耳。那声音又粗又哑，又短促，颇有点锯木板的味道。记得头一次我听见一只豹这样叫，我还以为它害了什么怪病，后来经过考证，才知道是“相思病”！
    最动人的，我觉得还是狼嚎。那真是一种阴森、凄凉、漫长而愁煞的声音。在更深夜静里听几只狼此起彼落地呼嚎，很容易令人想起“百鬼夜哭”的说法。虽然谁也没听见过鬼哭，但古人把狼嚎和鬼哭连结在一起，确是设想得妙！不知有多少个深夜，我被那凄凉的嚎声由梦中唤醒，久久不能入寐。
    狼最喜欢在夜里呼嚎，尤其是在冬天的月夜里。动物学家固然知道那是在狼的发情季节，但文学家中也颇有懂得的。讲到狼嚎，不能不使人忆及杰克伦敦的“野性的呼声”中的那一幕。在那遥远的阿拉斯加原野，在凄清的雪夜里，远处传来了发情中的雌狼的漫长呼声，强烈地引诱着猛犬巴克。它徘徊而又徘徊，一方是对主人的忠诚爱护，另一方则是来自原野中的难以抗拒的诱惑。至终，狼嚎唤醒了流在它血液中的狼的祖先的本性，它跑向遥远的天边，追逐狼群去了。
    想到这里，就连那鬼哭般的嚎声也好似有点可爱呢！
    与兽类相反，鸟类中很少有夜间鸣唱的。被莎士比亚、雪莱、密尔顿这些大诗人刻划得那么迷人的夜莺，在中国既不产，动物园中也没有养，所以无从了解它究竟唱出什么样的夜曲。但这里我也想起我们有的一种鸟，就是那羽毛鲜黄澄亮，好比一只金鸟般的黄鹂。在春寒料峭的四月里，它曾给我带来几多的春之喜悦。它是醒得特别早的鸟。天还黑着，离破晓还早，两只黄鹂就对唱起来了。那歌声是如此的清脆嘹亮，如此的抑扬顿挫而富于旋律，又对唱得那么富于戏剧性，我觉得较比夜莺一定不在以下。孟浩然老夫子所吟的“春眠不觉晓，处处闻啼鸟”，不知是否指黄鹂说的（我以为很可能），但我的春眠却常常在蒙矓中因听黄鹂歌唱而醒。可惜的是，在笼中养黄鹂，很难活得长久，即使养只小的幸而活过冬天，也往往多死于春天。笼外边桃红柳绿，由南方回来的黄鹂正歌唱着爱情。这对于它可能是刺激太大了。
