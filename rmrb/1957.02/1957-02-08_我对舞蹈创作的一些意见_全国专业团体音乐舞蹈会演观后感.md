Some Opinions on Dance Creation
    ——Reflections After Watching the National Professional Troupe Music and Dance Performance
                  Hu Guogang
    Dance, like other art forms, truthfully reflects people's lives through its artistic image, thereby achieving the role of inspiring and educating the people. Therefore, those dance works that can more truthfully reflect people's lives and possess the necessary formal perfection and technical fullness as a dance art itself will more easily evoke people's aesthetic sense and achieve the role of inspiring and educating the people. Conversely, all dance works that are divorced from life and cannot truthfully reflect life, no matter how "gorgeous" they are in form or how "dazzling" they are in technique, although they possess the general characteristics of dance art, will not necessarily be welcomed and loved by people.
    However, how dance art truthfully reflects life should also be distinguished from other arts: in the expression of realistic, ancient, allegorical, and fairy-tale themes, it should be allowed to achieve the purpose of truthfully reflecting life through various styles and techniques of realism, virtuality, and the "stylization" of traditional national dance. The application of various styles and techniques in dance art does not hinder it from achieving the purpose of truthfully expressing life.
    The requirements for the ideological content of dance works should also be distinguished from other arts: the characteristics of dance art should be considered, as it has its own strengths and certain limitations. However, within the scope of what dance can express about life, it is entirely possible and necessary to require it to express the noble virtues and sentiments of the people in their labor, struggle, friendship, and love life, as well as the exposure and satire of ugly phenomena.
    This time, many excellent dance programs in the National Professional Troupe Music and Dance Performance, such as "Flowers and Youth," "Male Joy and Female Happiness," "March 3rd," "Lazy Woman Seizing the Field," "Stepping on Girls," "Milkmaids," and "Young Patriots," have made good achievements in how to truthfully reflect life through dance art. Conversely, some dance programs, if viewed solely from the perspective of form and technique, cannot be said to be bad. However, some are divorced from the life reality that the dance needs and can express; some are due to the poverty of life content and excessive exaggeration in form; some reflect the truth of life in one aspect but destroy it in another... thus failing to evoke our strong aesthetic sense and receive welcome from the audience. This is especially true in the creation of some dances that express the lives of ethnic minorities, where, due to the violation of the customs, habits, and ideological feelings of that ethnic group in certain aspects, even though it seems to be more "perfect" and "advanced" than the original dance of that ethnic group in form and technique, it not only fails to gain the love of the audience but also causes dissatisfaction among the ethnic group.
    To truthfully reflect life in dance and create truly beautiful artistic images is not an easy task. It requires us to truly immerse ourselves in life and learn and master those things that can express the truly progressive and beautiful aspects of the lives of our people today and in ancient times in the traditions of our national and folk dance art. Because our efforts in this area are not enough, ideas such as being divorced from life, divorced from traditional forms, and simply pursuing the "perfection" of dance art forms and the "dazzling" of techniques constantly attack us. For example, taking our national and folk dances and comparing them with foreign classical (ballet) dance dramas and other folk dance forms and techniques, attempting to use them as "standards" and using their special rules to "process" and "improve" our own national and folk dances to suit the style of foreign dances; or simply treating all of our own national and folk dances as "materials" (as if we do not yet have a formed dance art), and then "creating" them according to the style of foreign dances. This is the fundamental reason why some "ballet" movements and foreign dance techniques were stiffly added to dance works depicting the image of the Chinese people in the past, making the image of the Chinese people in the dance "mixed Chinese and Western" and "neither Chinese nor Western."
    By saying this, I do not mean that we cannot and do not need to learn useful things from foreign dance art to enrich and develop our own dance art. The Chinese people greatly enjoy the dance art of people from all countries, just as people from all countries greatly enjoy our Chinese dance art. In human life and in the dance art of various countries, there are things that can be completely understood and evoke common aesthetic feelings. Among them, especially when we appreciate the dance art of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, the high degree of enthusiasm for building socialism and striving for a happy and beautiful life, and the perfection in the form of dance art and the high degree of development in technology often evoke strong aesthetic feelings and resonance in our thoughts and feelings. This is why we need to learn, introduce, and perform dance art works from various countries. Another aspect of why the dance art of other countries can arouse our interest in appreciation is that we can see their national characteristics and the characteristics of their dance art from their performances. For the former, we not only can but should absorb their advanced experience in developing and improving dance art to enrich and develop our own dance art. This includes their principles in training dancers, in processing and organizing folk dances, and in the choreography of dances and dance dramas; but we must never neglect the study of the special laws of development of our own national and folk dances (including: dance movements, the rules of "combination" of movements, dance plots, formation characteristics, etc.) because we have learned these principles. For the latter, it can also be used as a reference for how to express our national characteristics and develop the special laws of national dance in our dances, but it must never replace it.
    The purpose of collecting, organizing, processing, and developing national and folk dance art is to enable it to more truthfully express the life of a nation or a region in a specific historical period. We can only develop and improve it within the laws that the dance itself can develop; and we can only absorb other things to enrich and develop it under the conditions that are compatible with its own development laws. Otherwise, it will inevitably have a negative effect of destroying and weakening its characteristics. Under this general task, the work can be divided into two aspects: organizing and preserving traditional dance art and developing and creating new dance art: the first aspect refers to those dance programs that express the true life of our nation in a certain historical period and have progressive significance, as well as those unique dance art forms. Such as: "Touring the Sun", "Pigeon Quail Nest", "Male Joy and Female Happiness", "Fragrant Flower Drum Dance" in this performance. These must be kept as much as possible in their original historical life appearance, and any irresponsible random changes will put us at risk of losing the national dance tradition and cutting off the history of national dance. However, in order to bring these dances to the stage so that they can be seen by more audiences, it is also necessary and necessary to supplement the lost and incomplete parts based on the partial materials that have been mastered and the relevant materials that reflect the historical life at that time, so that it is more perfect in form and allows the audience to see a more complete picture of the historical life at that time. The other aspect refers to the various dance art forms that are still widely popular among the people and continue to develop with the development of the people's lives, such as the "Yangge Dance" that is popular in the Han Chinese area and the various dances that are popular in other ethnic areas. Although there are also programs among them that express historical life, in the broad masses of the people, it has been continuously developed to serve as a dance form that expresses the lives of the people today. On the law of the possible development of this dance art form itself, under the conditions that are compatible with its own development law, it is not only possible but also necessary to absorb other things to enrich and develop it, and to create dance works and new dance art forms that express the lives of the people today. In this work, we need bold creation; according to the needs of expressing new life, gradually expanding the ability of the original art form to express life in terms of form and technique, so as to break through and create new dance art forms, not to be constrained. This is the reason why many dance dramas and dance programs that reflect today's life, such as "Young Patriots", "Milkmaids". "Pulling Radishes", "When Frost Falls", "Construction Site Rest", "Purchasing Agents Arrive", and "Opening Dance" in the performance are welcomed and valued by everyone.
    We need to organize and preserve the old traditional programs, and at the same time, we need to create new dances that reflect today's life. We cannot throw away the old because we are creating new dances, nor can we not create new dances because we have old ones. In this way, our entire dance art activity can continue to move forward on a healthy path.

    我对舞蹈创作的一些意见
    ——全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演观后感
                  胡果刚
    舞蹈和其他艺术形式一样，是通过它的艺术形象真实地反映人民的生活，来达到鼓舞和教育人民的作用。因此，那些愈能真实地反映出人民的生活、具备了作为舞蹈艺术本身所必须具备的形式上的完美和技巧上的充实等条件的舞蹈作品，就愈能引起人们的美感，达到鼓舞和教育人民的作用。与此相反，一切脱离生活、不能真实地反映生活的舞蹈作品，不论它在形式上多么“华丽”、技巧上多么“炫耀”，也具备了一般舞蹈艺术的特征，却并不一定会受到人们的欢迎和喜爱。
    但是，对舞蹈艺术怎样真实地反映生活，也应该与其他艺术有所区别：在表现现实、古代、寓言、童话的题材上，应该允许它通过写实的、虚拟的以及民族舞蹈传统“程式化”的各种风格与手法，来达到真实地反映生活的目的。舞蹈艺术上各种风格和手法的应用，并不妨碍它达到真实地表现生活的目的。
    对于舞蹈作品思想性的要求，也应该与其他艺术有所区别：应该考虑到舞蹈艺术的特点，它有自己的特长，也有一定的限制。但在舞蹈可能表现生活的范围内，要求它表现出人民在劳动、战斗、友谊、爱情生活中的高尚品德与情操，以及对丑恶现象的揭露与讽刺等，则是完全可能和必要的。
    这次，全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演中很多优秀的舞蹈节目，如：“花儿与少年”、“男欢女喜”、“三月三”、“懒婆娘抢场”、“踩姑娘”、“挤奶员”、“少年爱国者”等，在如何通过舞蹈艺术真实地反映生活上，作出了很好的成绩。与此相反，有的舞蹈节目，如果单从形式与技巧上看，不能说它不好。但是，有的由于脱离了那个舞蹈需要和可能表现的生活真实；有的由于生活内容的贫乏，和在形式上的过分夸张；有的虽在某一点上反映了生活的真实，而在另一点上又破坏了……便不能引起我们强烈的美感，受到观众的欢迎。这特别在有些表现少数民族生活的舞蹈的创作中，由于它在某些方面违反了那个民族真实生活的风俗习惯与思想感情，尽管它在形式和技巧上，似乎比那个民族原来的舞蹈都“完美”和“提高”得多了，然而它不但得不到观众的喜爱，还会引起本民族的不满。
    要想在舞蹈中真实地反映生活、创造出真正美的艺术形象，并不是一件容易的事情。它需要我们真正地深入生活，并在我们民族、民间舞蹈艺术的传统中，学习与掌握那些能够表现我们今天和古代人民生活里真正具有进步意义和美好的东西。由于我们在这方面的努力还不够，那些脱离生活、脱离传统形式，单纯追求舞蹈艺术形式上的“完美”与技巧上的“炫耀”等思想，就不时地袭击着我们。譬如，将我们民族、民间的舞蹈拿去与外国的古典（芭蕾）舞剧和其他的民间舞蹈的形式和技巧相比较，企图以它们作为“标准”，用它们的特殊规律来“加工”和“提高”我们自己民族、民间的舞蹈，来适合外国舞蹈的样式；或者是简单地将我们自己民族、民间的舞蹈都当作“素材”（好像我们自己还没有成型的舞蹈艺术），再按照外国舞蹈的样式把它“创作”出来。这就是过去为什么在表现中国人民形象的舞蹈作品中，生硬地加进一些“芭蕾”舞动作和外国舞蹈技巧，将舞蹈中中国人民的形象弄得“中西混杂”和“不中不西”的根本原因。
    我这样说，并不意味着我们不可能和不需要学习外国舞蹈艺术中有用的东西，用来充实和发展我们自己的舞蹈艺术。中国人民非常喜欢各国人民的舞蹈艺术，正如各国人民也非常喜欢我们中国的舞蹈艺术一样。在人类生活中、在各个国家的舞蹈艺术中，都存在着完全可以相互理解和引起共同美感的东西。其中，尤其是当我们欣赏苏联和其他兄弟国家舞蹈艺术的时候，它们所表现出来的那种为建设社会主义、争取美好幸福生活的高度热情，和在舞蹈艺术形式上的完美与技术上的高度发展等，常常会引起我们心理上强烈的美感和思想感情上的共鸣。这也就是我们为什么需要学习、介绍与上演各国舞蹈艺术作品的原因。别的国家的舞蹈艺术，也能够引起我们欣赏兴趣的另一方面，是我们可以从它的表演中，看到他们的民族特性和舞蹈艺术上的特性。对于前者，我们不仅可能，而且应该吸收他们在发展和提高舞蹈艺术上的先进经验，来充实和发展我们自己的舞蹈艺术。其中，包括他们在培养舞蹈演员、在加工与整理民间舞蹈、在舞蹈和舞剧的编导上的原理等；但绝不能因为学了这些原理，就忽视了对自己民族、民间舞蹈发展的特殊规律的研究（其中包括：舞蹈动作、动作“组合”的章法、舞蹈情节、队形等的特点）。对于后者，也可以将它作为怎样在我们的舞蹈中，表现我们民族特性和发展民族舞蹈特殊规律的借鉴，但绝不能取而代之。
    搜集、整理、加工和发展民族、民间舞蹈艺术的目的，在于使它能够更真实地表现一个民族、一个地区，在一个特定历史时期里的生活面貌。我们只能在这个舞蹈本身可能发展的规律上去发展和提高它；并且也只可能在与它本身发展规律相适应的条件下，吸收其他的东西来充实和发展它。不然，必定会起破坏和削弱它的特点的消极作用。在这一总的任务下，可分为整理与保存传统的舞蹈艺术和发展与创造新的舞蹈艺术两个方面的工作：第一方面，是指那些表现我们民族在某一个历史时期内真实的生活面貌和具有进步意义的舞蹈节目，以及那些特有的舞蹈艺术形式。如：这次会演中的“游太阳”、“鸽鹑里窝”、“男欢女喜”、“花香鼓舞”等。这些就必须尽量地保持它原有的历史生活面貌，任何不负责任的乱加改动，都会使我们有失掉民族舞蹈传统和割断民族舞蹈历史的危险。但是，为了将这些舞蹈搬上舞台，让它能与更多的观众见面，根据已经掌握到的部分材料和反映当时历史生活的有关材料，将它失传和残缺的部分补充起来，使它在形式上更加完善，让观众通过它能看到当时历史生活较完整的面貌，也是应该和必要的。另一方面，是指那些现在还广泛地流行在人民中间，并且随着人民生活的发展仍在继续发展的多种舞蹈艺术形式，如在汉族地区普遍流行的“秧歌舞”和在其他民族地区普遍流行的各种舞蹈。它们中间虽也有表现历史生活的节目，但在广大群众中，已经不断地发展它来作为表现今天人民生活的舞蹈形式了。在这种舞蹈艺术形式本身可能发展的规律上，在与它本身发展规律相适应的条件下，吸收其他的东西去充实和发展它，并创造出表现今天人民生活面貌的舞蹈作品与新的舞蹈艺术形式，不仅可能，而且是必要的。在这个工作上，需要我们大胆的创造；根据表现新生活的需要，逐渐地在形式和技巧上扩大原有艺术形式表现生活的能力，来突破和创造出新的舞蹈艺术形式，不能束手束脚。这就是会演中“少年爱国者”、“挤奶员”。“拔萝卜”、“降霜的时候”、“工地休息”、“收购员来了”、“通车舞”等很多反映今天生活的舞剧和舞蹈节目，受到大家欢迎和重视的原因。
    我们需要整理与保存旧有的传统节目，同时，也需要创作反映今天生活的新的舞蹈。我们不能因为创作新的舞蹈就扔掉旧的，也不能因为有了旧的舞蹈就不创作新的。这样，我们整个舞蹈艺术活动，才能在一条健康的大道上不断地前进。
