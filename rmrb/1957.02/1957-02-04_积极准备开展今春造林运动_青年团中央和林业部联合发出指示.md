Xinhua News Agency report: The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Ministry of Forestry of the People's Republic of China recently issued a joint directive on launching the spring afforestation work for 1957, calling on the broad masses of youth and the people of the whole country to actively prepare to launch this spring's afforestation campaign.

The directive first pointed out that the large-scale afforestation movement launched last year by the broad masses of people across the country under the inspiration of the great call to "Green the Motherland in Twelve Years" has greened thousands of villages and overfulfilled the 1956 afforestation task. This year's afforestation task is quite arduous: not only must we comprehensively complete the new planting tasks, but also do a good job in replanting; not only must we protect forests, but also nurture them; at the same time, we must also do a good job in seedling cultivation. The directive requires all localities to check afforested land and seedlings as soon as possible, and rationally arrange the labor force. The directive said that afforestation is a seasonal and technical production activity, and must be comprehensively planned and uniformly arranged in all aspects to prepare for it, so as to avoid the disconnection between forest land, seedlings, and labor, and the phenomena of sowing and planting without selecting forest land, and wasting work and resources. In preparing forest land, we should, with the township or cooperative as the unit, universally check all the forest land to be afforested this year, according to the requirements of gradual development, from near to far, from easy to difficult, from low mountains to high mountains, and segmented construction. After the forest land is selected, we should actively carry out land preparation. When determining the types of forests and trees, we should pay attention to the correct combination of the long-term interests and current interests of the masses, and make arrangements according to local conditions; we must master enough high-quality seedlings to ensure quality and quantity; we must pay attention to strengthening the adjustment of seedlings and the inventory of seedlings, so as to have a clear understanding; units with insufficient seedlings should promptly submit their needs to cooperatives or state-owned nurseries with surplus seedlings, and should not rely on digging wild seedlings to solve the problem. The supplying units should guarantee the specifications and quantity of seedlings transferred out and supply them according to plan.

Solving the problem of labor remuneration and organizing the afforestation team is the second point that the directive emphasizes. The directive said that in the past, some agricultural production cooperatives regarded all or part of the afforestation work as compulsory labor, which resulted in low enthusiasm of the members for afforestation and a low survival rate of afforestation. Forestry departments at all levels should suggest that local party committees and governments solve this problem. In many areas, agricultural cooperatives have implemented a unified distribution of profits for agriculture and forestry, which is beneficial to the comprehensive development of production, increasing the income of members, and further improving the quality of afforestation. Forestry departments and the Communist Youth League committees should actively study and summarize the specific methods and experiences of unified work-point distribution and profit sharing in agriculture and forestry in various places, and promote them. In order to make the distribution of profits in agriculture and forestry more rational, we should, according to the principle of distribution according to work and with reference to agricultural labor quotas, conscientiously formulate forestry labor quotas so as to have a basis for unified work evaluation and work-point recording. The directive also put forward several experiences from last year for local research and adoption.

The directive also emphasized the need to improve afforestation techniques and strengthen management. The directive said that improving the quality of afforestation largely depends on improving the afforestation techniques of the masses. Training forestry workers is an effective measure to implement afforestation technical regulations and improve the technical level of afforestation among the masses. The Communist Youth League committees in various places should assist forestry departments and forestry work stations to seize the time to actively carry out the training of forestry workers and give full play to their role. The directive requires that each agricultural cooperative have at least one or two technically savvy forestry workers.

The directive also requires forestry departments and Communist Youth League committees in various places to pay attention to summarizing the experience of the masses and promote it in a timely manner. After the afforestation is completed, commendations and model selections should be carried out. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen leadership over afforestation work and do a good job in publicity and mobilization.

    积极准备开展今春造林运动
    青年团中央和林业部联合发出指示
    新华社讯　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华人民共和国林业部最近发出了关于开展1957年春季造林工作的联合指示，号召广大青年和全国人民一起，积极准备开展今春造林运动。
    指示首先指出，去年全国广大群众在“十二年绿化祖国”这一伟大号召的鼓舞下所开展的声势浩大的造林运动，已使成千上万的乡村绿化，并且超额完成了1956年造林任务。今年造林任务相当艰巨：既要全面完成新造任务，又要做好补植工作；既要护林，又要抚育；同时还要做好育苗工作。指示要求各地要尽快地检查造林地、检查种苗、合理地安排劳动力。指示说，造林是一项带有季节性和技术性的生产活动，必须从各方面加以全面筹划，统一安排，作好准备，以免林地、种苗、劳力之间相互脱节和不择林地有种就播、有苗就栽，以及窝工浪费等现象发生。在准备林地中，应当以乡或社为单位，根据逐步发展、由近到远、由易到难、先低山后高山、分段分片施工的要求，将今年所要造的林地普遍检查一遍。林地选定后，就应积极进行整地。在确定林种、树种时，应当注意群众长远利益和目前利益的正确结合，因地制宜地加以安排；要掌握足够的优良种苗，以保质保量；要注意加强种苗调剂和种苗清查工作，做到心中有数；种苗不足的单位，要及早就近向多余种苗的合作社或国营苗圃提出需要计划，不能依靠挖野生苗来解决，供应单位要保证外调苗木的规格和数量，按计划进行供应。
    解决劳动报酬，组织好造林队伍，是指示着重指出的第二点。指示说，过去有些农业生产合作社将全部或一部分造林用工作为义务工，因而产生社员造林积极性不高，和造林成活率偏低的现象，各级林业部门应建议当地党委和政府加以解决。有不少地区的农业社实行农林统一分红的办法，对全面发展生产，增加社员收入，进一步提高造林质量都是有利的。林业部门和团委应积极地研究和总结各地农林统一记工分红的具体办法和经验，加以推广。为了使农林分红更趋于合理，就应当根据按劳取酬的原则，并参照农业劳动定额，认真地制定林业劳动定额，以便在统一评工记分时有所依据。指示中还提出去年若干经验供各地研究采用。
    指示还强调要提高造林技术，加强经营管理。指示说，提高造林质量在很大程度上在于提高群众的造林技术。训练林业员就是一种贯彻造林技术规程、提高群众造林技术水平的有效措施。各地团委应协助林业部门和林业工作站抓紧时间，积极进行林业员的训练工作，并且充分发挥他们的作用。指示要求每个农业社至少有一至二个以上懂得技术的林业员。
    指示还要求各地林业部门和团委注意总结群众的经验，及时加以推广。造林结束后要进行评功选模。同时要加强对造林工作的领导和作好宣传动员工作。
