Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 5th. The local organizations of various democratic parties in Henan Province have recently experienced significant development.

    In the past two months, the Jiusan Society has successively established central direct groups in Luoyang, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou and other cities. Almost all members of the Jiusan Society in these three cities are newly joined. At present, nearly 40 professors, engineers and other staff members have been absorbed as members of the Jiusan Society in Zhengzhou University, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Kaifeng Normal College, and Luoyang Tractor Manufacturing School.
    The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, and the China National Democratic Construction Association have all grown at a much faster rate in the past year than in previous years. The number of people developed by the China Democratic League in Henan Province in the past year is equivalent to 40% of the total number of original members in the province. The number of people developed by the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in the past year is also equivalent to 24% of the original members. The China National Democratic Construction Association originally only had grassroots organizations in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou. Due to the increasing number of newly developed members and those transferred from Shanghai and other places in the past year, in addition to establishing a preparatory organization for the municipal-level organization in Xinxiang City recently, it is also preparing to establish the Henan Provincial Working Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association this year.

    各民主党派河南省地方组织有很大发展
    新华社郑州5日电　各民主党派在河南省的地方组织近来有了很大发展。
    最近两个月以来，九三学社在洛阳、开封、郑州等市先后成立了中央直属小组。这三个市的九三学社社员几乎全部都是新近加入的。目前，在郑州大学、黄河水利委员会、开封师范学院和洛阳拖拉机制造学校等单位，已经有近四十名教授、工程师和其他工作人员被吸收为九三学社社员。
    中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟和中国民主建国会，最近一年来的发展速度也都大大超过往年。中国民主同盟一年来在河南省发展的人数，相当于全省原有盟员总数的40％。中国国民党革命委员会一年来发展的人数也相当于原有成员的24％。中国民主建国会原来只在开封、郑州两市有基层组织，由于一年来新发展的和从上海等地转来的会员日益增多，最近除了在新乡市成立了市级组织的筹备机构外，并且准备在今年成立中国民主建国会河南省工作委员会。
