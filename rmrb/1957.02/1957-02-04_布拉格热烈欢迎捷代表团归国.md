The purpose of our visit to the Soviet Union was for brothers to treat each other equally and advise each other sincerely: to ensure that our cooperation develops smoothly in the future, further strengthen the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp, more resolutely expose all provocative actions and conspiracies of international imperialism, and make further efforts to win the victory of peace and friendship between all peoples. The results of the Moscow talks fully realized all our wishes. The talks further strengthened Soviet-Czech friendship and the solidarity between the socialist countries.
