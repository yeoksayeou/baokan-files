Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss the Middle East issue. The discussion on this issue had been postponed twice at the request of the United States.

Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik presented a six-nation proposal to the Assembly requesting UN member states to "refuse to give Israel any military, economic or financial assistance and convenience."

The six co-sponsors of the proposal are Afghanistan, Indonesia, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Sudan. The full text of the proposal is as follows:

"The General Assembly,

"Recalling its resolutions adopted on November 2, 1956, November 4, 1956, November 7, 1956, November 24, 1956, January 19, 1957, and February 2, 1957,

"Noting the Secretary-General's report submitted on February 11, 1957,

"Gravely concerned to note that Israel has not complied with the provisions of the above resolutions, hereby

"1. Condemns Israel for not complying with the above resolutions,

"2. In view of Israel's continued defiance of the above resolutions, requests all countries to refuse to give Israel any military, economic or financial assistance and convenience,

"3. Requests all countries to report to the Secretary-General on the implementation of this resolution,

"4. Requests the Secretary-General to report again on the implementation of the General Assembly's current resolution and past resolutions."

Malik said when submitting the proposal, "Although this proposal was initiated by only these six member states, it has the support of many other member states of the United Nations." He also said, "We believe that withdrawal must be unconditional."

Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi stated that the General Assembly should now condemn Israel's continued refusal to withdraw its troops and end Israel's aggression against Egypt. The "time has come."

Before discussing the issue of Israeli troop withdrawal, the Assembly adopted a proposal from ten countries including Afghanistan, requesting approval of Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's February 11 report on the implementation of the General Assembly's February 2 resolution requiring Israel to withdraw its troops and the February 9 report on the status of the United Nations Emergency Force stationed in Egypt. The Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries abstained from voting on the ten-nation proposal. Soviet representative Sobolev said that, according to the Charter, the United Nations General Assembly has no right to establish United Nations forces, and only the Security Council has this power.

In a brief speech, Secretary-General Hammarskjöld spoke of Egypt's cooperative attitude toward the United Nations and said that he had no additions to his report on the troop withdrawal issue because the situation remained the same.

The United States' actions have prevented the General Assembly from taking swift action on the issue of sanctions against Israel. A U.S. spokesperson announced that the United States' attitude on this issue would not be determined until Dulles had met with Israeli Ambassador to the United States Eban, who is returning to his post.

The General Assembly's discussion on the issue of Israeli troop withdrawal will continue next Monday.

    阿富汗等六国在联大提出提案
    要求各国不给以色列援助和便利
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会22日下午举行全体会议讨论中东问题。关于这个问题的讨论曾经应美国的要求而两度延期。
    黎巴嫩外交部长马利克向大会提出一个六国提案，要求联合国会员国“拒绝给予以色列军事、经济或者财政方面的一切援助和便利”。
    六国提案的发起国是阿富汗、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、巴基斯坦和苏丹。提案全文如下：
    “大会，
    “追忆到它在1956年11月2日、1956年11月4日、1956年11月7日、1956年11月24日、1957年1月19日和1957年2月2日所通过的决议，
    “注意到秘书长在1957年2月11日所提出的报告，
    “非常关切地注意到以色列没有遵守上述各项决议的规定，兹将
    “一、谴责以色列不遵守上述各项决议，
    “二、鉴于以色列继续违抗上述各项决议，要求各国拒绝给予以色列军事、经济或者财政方面的一切援助和便利，
    “三、要求一切国家向秘书长报告执行这项决议的情况，
    “四、要求秘书长再次就大会目前这项决议和过去各项决议的执行情况提出报告。”
    马利克在提出提案的时候说，“虽然这项提案仅仅是这六个会员国发起的，但是它得到联合国其他许多会员国的支持。”他还说，“我们认为，撤退必须是无条件的。”
    埃及外交部长法齐发言指出，大会现在应该谴责以色列继续拒绝撤军和结束以色列对埃及的侵略。现在已经“到时候了”。
    在讨论以色列撤军问题以前，大会通过了阿富汗等十个国家的一项提案，这个提案要求批准秘书长哈马舍尔德11日关于大会2月2日要求以色列撤军的决议执行情况的报告和9日关于驻埃及联合国紧急部队地位问题的报告。苏联和东欧人民民主国家在表决十国提案时弃权。苏联代表索波列夫说，根据宪章，联合国大会无权建立联合国部队，只有安理会才有这种权力。
    秘书长哈马舍尔德在简短发言中谈到埃及对联合国采取的合作态度，并且说，他对撤军问题的报告没有补充，因为局势依旧。
    美国的行动使大会不能就制裁以色列问题迅速采取行动，美国发言人宣布，美国在这个问题上的态度要等杜勒斯同正在返职的以色列驻美大使伊班会谈后才能确定。
    大会关于以色列撤军问题的讨论将在下星期一继续进行。
