　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 4th - In inspecting the implementation of ethnic policies, various areas of Guangxi Province are taking measures to correct shortcomings in the ethnic representation of organs in autonomous areas and to resolve problems that were improperly handled in the collectivization of minority areas.

　　Prior to the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, among the forty-three counties and cities in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, thirteen counties still had Han cadres serving as county heads. After the inspection, through general elections, except for Binyang and Rong’an counties, where the Han population is in the majority and Han cadres serve as county heads, all other counties have newly elected minority cadres to serve as county heads. In the past, there were no minority cadres on the Committee of the CPC Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, but now seven minority party member cadres have been promoted to participate in the Prefectural Committee. In some areas, inspections revealed that some Han leading cadres in the past lacked political warmth and concern for upper-class minority figures and did not trust them enough. This has also been reviewed and corrected. The phenomenon of some Han cadres discriminating against or not respecting the authority of minority cadres in the past has also undergone significant changes after inspection.

　　During the inspection, some counties in Yishan, Baise, and Pingle regions also dispatched a large number of cadres to conduct visits in remote minority mountainous areas. Yuan Bangdian (Han), Secretary of the CPC Xincheng County Committee, led 250 cadres from county-level organs to launch visitation activities in twenty-two townships in remote minority mountainous areas to help solve the current difficulties in the lives and production of the people in these areas. During the visitation process, he took the initiative to review the past subjectivist and coercive commanding errors in leading production. Leftover problems in collectivization were dealt with and adjusted. For example, it was determined that the sheep raised by Yao commune members for sacrificial purposes would not be entered into the commune; scattered trees and fruit trees that had already been entered into the commune were returned to the personal ownership of the commune members. The minority commune members were very satisfied with this.

　　This inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies began last August. Over the past few months, inspections have been carried out in various forms in most minority areas of Guangxi Province, and certain achievements have been made. However, to date, some areas still do not pay enough attention to this work and have been slow to conduct inspections. Recently, the CPC Guangxi Provincial Committee again issued instructions, requiring areas that have not yet started inspection work to quickly conduct inspections, and those that are currently inspecting should strengthen leadership and strive to end them throughout the province by the end of February.

    广西省在检查民族政策执行情况工作中
    努力促进自治地方机关民族化
    合作化中处理不当的问题也作了纠正
    新华社南宁4日电　广西省各地在检查民族政策执行情况中，采取措施，纠正自治地方机关民族化方面的缺点和解决少数民族地区合作化中处理不当的问题。
    在检查民族政策执行情况以前，桂西僮族自治州四十三个县、市中，尚有十三个县的县长由汉族干部担任。检查后，通过普选，现在除汉族人口占多数的宾阳、融安两个县是汉族干部任县长外，其他各县都新选了少数民族干部担任县长。中共桂西僮族自治州地方委员会委员中，过去没有一个少数民族干部，现在也提拔了七名少数民族党员干部参加地委。有些地区检查中发现有的汉族领导干部过去对待少数民族上层人士缺乏政治上的热诚关怀，对他们不够信任。这次也进行了检讨和纠正。有的汉族干部过去歧视或不尊重少数民族干部职权的现象，经检查后也有了明显的改变。
    检查中，宜山、百色、平乐等地区部分县还抽调了大批干部深入边远少数民族山区进行访问。中共忻城县县委书记袁邦殿（汉族）领导县直属机关干部二百五十人到边远少数民族山区二十二个乡展开访问活动，帮助解决这些地区人民目前生活、生产上的困难。在访问过程中，对过去领导生产上的主观主义、强迫命令的错误做法，主动地作了检讨。对合作化中的遗留问题，进行了处理和调整。如瑶族社员自养用作祭祀的羊，确定不入社；零星的林木、果树已经入社的，退还给社员个人所有。这样做以后，少数民族社员都很满意。
    这次民族政策执行情况的检查是去年8月开始的。几个月来，在广西省大部分少数民族地区采取各种形式进行了检查，并取得了一定的成绩。但是至今仍有少部分地区对这一工作重视不够，迟迟没有检查。最近，中共广西省委员会再次发出指示，要求尚未开始进行检查工作的地区迅速检查，正在检查的也应加强领导，争取在2月底前在全省范围内结束。
