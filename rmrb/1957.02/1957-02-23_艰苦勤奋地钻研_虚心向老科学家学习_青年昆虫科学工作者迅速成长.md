Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: At the academic paper discussion meeting of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, many young scientific workers presented their papers.

The Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has completed 143 academic papers in seven years, about half of which were written by young people.

The person in charge of the institute said that these young people are mostly graduates of universities before and after liberation, and now have a certain ability to conduct independent research work. Their common characteristic is that they can study and learn diligently in combination with their work, or they can humbly act as assistants to senior researchers.

Young scientific workers are distributed in various research aspects such as insect classification, morphology, ecology, physiology, and toxicology. Chen Yonglin, a 29-year-old who was promoted to assistant researcher, graduated from university in 1950. Under the leadership of researcher Ma Shijun, he conducted locust survey and research work. In August 1954, the Yangtze and Huai Rivers experienced floods that had not been seen for many years. In order to study the locust areas during the flood and the locust situation at that time, Chen Yonglin risked taking a small boat to the Hongze Lake locust area for observation. In the process of repeated research and collection of data, he not only helped the veteran scientist complete the task, but also improved himself. "Overview of Chinese Acrididae" is a relatively outstanding work in the field of locust classification research in China. When Xia Kailing conducted this research, he humbly asked the director of the institute, Chen Shixiang, for advice, and also went to many remote places such as Xinjiang to collect locust specimens. Assistant researcher Zhang Guangxue, under the leadership of Deputy Director Zhu Hongfu for three or four years, has explored a set of cotton aphid prediction and forecasting methods, which has played a great role in the prevention of cotton aphid hazards by the production departments.

    艰苦勤奋地钻研　虚心向老科学家学习
    青年昆虫科学工作者迅速成长
    新华社22日讯　在中国科学院昆虫研究所的学术论文讨论会上，不少青年科学工作者宣读了自己的论文。
    中国科学院昆虫研究所七年中完成了一百四十三篇学术论文，其中约有一半是年轻人作的。
    研究所负责人说，这些年轻人大都是解放前后的大学毕业生，现在有了一定的独立研究工作能力。他们的共同特点是能结合工作艰苦勤奋地钻研和学习，或者能虚心地作好高级研究员的助手工作。
    年轻的科学工作者分布在昆虫分类、形态、生态、生理、毒理等各个研究方面。被提升为助理研究员的二十九岁的陈永林，是1950年的大学毕业生。他在研究员马世骏的领导下，进行蝗虫的调查研究工作。1954年8月，长江、淮河涨起了多年未有的大水，他们为了研究大水的蝗区和当时的蝗虫情况，陈永林冒险驾着小船到洪泽湖蝗区进行观察，在这样反复研究收集资料过程中，他不仅帮助老科学家完成了任务，也使自己得到了锻炼和提高。“中国蝗科概述”是国内蝗虫分类研究中的一篇比较出色的著作，夏开龄做这个研究时，虚心向研究所所长陈世骧请教，还跑到新疆等许多边远地方采集蝗虫标本。助理研究员张广学三、四年来在副所长朱弘复的领导下，摸索出了一套棉蚜预测预报方法，对生产部门预防棉蚜的危害起了很大作用。
