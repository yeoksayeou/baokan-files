Rely on the Strength of Commune Members to Prepare Production Funds for Agricultural Cooperatives
Educate Commune Members on Frugal Household Management
Invest More Surplus Money into Production
    This newspaper reports: According to the Sichuan Daily, farmers in Shijia District, Neijiang County, are actively investing their surplus cash into agricultural cooperatives to prepare for purchasing draught animals, fertilizers, and farm tools, and to expand reproduction.
    Last year, more than 240 agricultural cooperatives in this district achieved bumper harvests, and commune members' incomes generally increased. However, because the leadership had at one point relaxed its education of farmers on continuing to develop production, many commune members used large amounts of surplus funds to purchase currently unnecessary consumer goods, and waste even occurred in some places.
    After discovering this situation, the Shijia District Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly instructed the Party branches in each township to educate farmers on managing cooperatives and households frugally and developing production actively, mobilizing them to invest their surplus cash into the cooperatives, reduce state loans, and improve this year's production. Zhu Mingfang, a commune member of the Shao'an Agricultural Cooperative in Gongnong Township, consciously invested 150 yuan in cash into the cooperative. She said: Doing so achieves three goals at once: the state borrows less, which can increase construction; the cooperative has funds, so production is not difficult; and I waste less, turning pocket change into a lump sum. After calculating the benefits of more investment and more production, 29 commune member households in the Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Jingming Township invested more than 500 yuan in cash into the cooperative within a few days, and also plan to invest another 900 yuan recently to purchase the means of production needed by the cooperative, without taking out loans from the state. Shunjian, Qianjin, and other six agricultural cooperatives in Shidong Township had more loans last year. After discussion, commune members believed that they should run the cooperatives with their own strength and should not simply rely on state loans. They invested cash into the cooperatives one after another.
Careful Calculation, Increase Income and Reduce Expenditure
No Loans from the State This Year
    This newspaper reports: According to the New Hunan Daily, the Yuanjiao Agricultural Cooperative in Mayang County originally planned to apply for a loan from the state when formulating its 1957 financial plan. Later, after further discussion within the cooperative, it was believed that doing so did not conform to the spirit of running the cooperative frugally, and it was decided to solve this problem by themselves.
    Last year, the total income of the Yuanjiao Agricultural Cooperative commune members was more than 20,000 yuan. After using 15,000 yuan of this amount, together with a portion of household sideline income, to solve the living expenses of all commune members for one year, there was still more than 5,000 yuan in the hands of the commune members. The Cooperative Committee decided to call on commune members to invest this portion of money in the cooperative, turning dead money into live money, to increase production and create more wealth. This decision was supported by the commune members. Yang Zaimei, a female commune member, was prepared to invest 80 yuan into the cooperative alone. The Cooperative Committee also decided to carry out more than 20 sideline productions within the cooperative, which are expected to generate more than 12,000 yuan in income before April, and this portion of income will also be used to subsidize agricultural production expenses.
    The Cooperative Committee re-examined and revised the original financial plan, compressing and canceling some expenditure items that were too large and could be postponed or not done. For example, the original livestock feed expenditure was too large. The cooperative decided to set up a water mill to process bran, reducing purchases from the market, which could save expenses. After such careful calculation, a total of 8,630 yuan could be saved.
    Through the formulation and revision of the financial plan, the commune members received another practical education in patriotism and love for the cooperative. The entire cooperative is vigorously carrying out winter production, and has also taken out 15,000 jin of surplus grain to sell to the state, and plans to sell another 20,000 jin of wheat to the state after the wheat harvest.
Mobilize Commune Members to Invest in the Cooperative
Overcome Difficulties Through Self-Reliance
    This newspaper reports: The Nanzheng Agricultural Cooperative in Jianhu County, Jiangsu, mobilized commune members to invest in the cooperative, preparing sufficient production funds before the wheat harvest.
    This cooperative lacked experience in year-end distribution last year, and did not leave sufficient production funds; after the distribution, the cooperative only had more than 700 yuan left. Therefore, the Management Committee and the Party Branch decided to mobilize commune members to invest freely and overcome difficulties through self-reliance. The Party Branch first cleared the thinking of party members with economic strength, taking the lead in investing in the cooperative, and relying on active elements among the commune members to educate commune members meticulously on investing to improve production. After in-depth ideological mobilization, 108 households in the entire cooperative voluntarily invested 2,777 yuan, solving the difficulty of insufficient production funds. The local CPC District Committee believes that the cooperative's experience in mobilizing commune members to invest is very good and introduced it to all agricultural cooperatives in the district. Now, the 37 agricultural cooperatives in the entire district have mobilized commune members to invest a total of more than 70,000 yuan, preparing funds for spring plowing and sowing.
Difficult Problems Cannot Stump the Masses
Consult with the Masses and There Will Be a Solution
    This newspaper reports: The Guxian Agricultural Cooperative in Longxi County, Fujian, encountered a difficult problem in the annual distribution and settlement – “accounts but no money.” According to the 1956 financial settlement, more than 255,900 yuan should be distributed to the commune members, but now more than 38,700 yuan cannot be distributed because there is no cash. Among them, more than 22,000 yuan has been used by the cooperative's sideline businesses and various investments, and another 10,000 yuan worth of agricultural products has not been sold. Many commune members are worried that they will not be able to get the money and are unwilling to produce in the cooperative, going to engage in sideline production themselves.
    The Cooperative Management Committee convened a meeting of commune members to explain the actual difficulties and discuss solutions to the problem with everyone. Everyone believed that the money already invested in animal husbandry should not be withdrawn at present, because the pigs and chickens are still growing and should not be sold. The solutions proposed by everyone are: 1. First, sell some of the grain and other agricultural products stored in the cooperative and distribute the more than 12,700 yuan in cash obtained from this to the commune members; 2. For those whose labor remuneration has not been fully recovered, making it impossible to repay the loans from the credit cooperative, the cooperative should be responsible for repayment; if the cooperative is currently unable to repay, negotiate with the credit cooperative to extend the loan repayment period, and the interest will be borne by the agricultural cooperative; 3. Mobilize commune members to deposit temporarily unused money into the agricultural cooperative as production funds, and repay the commune members after the fish fry are sold, with interest paid in the same way as credit cooperative deposits. Now, the commune members have invested more than 17,970 yuan of surplus funds into the cooperative. The difficult problem has been solved in this way.

    依靠社员群众的力量筹备农业社生产资金
    教育社员勤俭治家
    多把余钱投入生产
    本报讯　据四川日报报道：内江县史家区农民积极把剩余现金，投入农业社，准备购买耕畜、肥料、农具，扩大再生产。
    去年这个区的二百四十多个农业社，都获得丰收，社员收入普遍增加；但由于领导上曾一度放松了对农民进行继续发展生产的教育，许多社员把大量的剩余资金，购买目前不十分需要的生活用品，个别地方还发生浪费现象。
    中共史家区委发现这种情况后，及时指示各乡党支部向农民进行了勤俭办社、勤俭治家，积极发展生产的教育，动员他们把剩余现金投到社上，减少国家贷款，搞好今年生产。工农乡绍安农业社社员朱明芳自觉地把一百五十元现金投到社里。她说：这样做一举三得：国家少贷款，可以多建设；社上有资金，生产不困难；自己少浪费，零钱变躉钱。靖明乡胜利农业社社员经过算多投资、多增产的账后，二十九户社员不几天就投了五百多元现金到社上，并且还计划最近再投资九百元，购买社里需要的生产资料，不向国家贷款。史东乡顺江、前进等六个农业社去年贷款较多，社员讨论后，认为要用自己的力量办社，不能单纯依赖国家贷款，纷纷把现金投到社里。
    精打细算开源节流
    今年不向国家借款
    本报讯　据新湖南报报道：麻阳县袁郊农业社前些时在制定1957年度财务计划时，准备向国家申请贷款。后来社里经过进一步讨论，认为这样做不符合勤俭办社的精神，决定由自己来解决这个问题。
    袁郊农业社去年社员的总收入共有二万多元，除了用其中一万五千元连同一部分家庭副业收入来解决全社社员一年的生活费用外，还有五千多元存在社员手里。社委会决定号召社员把这部分钱向社投资，变死钱为活钱，以增加生产和创造更多财富。这个决定得到社员拥护，光是妇女社员杨崽妹一户，就准备向社投资八十元。社委会还决定在社内开展二十多项副业生产，预计在4月份以前能够收入一万二千多元，把这部分收入也用来补助农业生产开支。
    社委会又重新审查和修订了原订的财务计划，压缩和取消了其中一些开支过大和可以缓办、不办的支出项目。如原订的牲畜饲料开支过大，社里决定设一架水碾来加工碾糠，少到市场去买糠，就可节省开支等。经过这样精打细算，一共可以节省出八千六百三十元。
    通过制定和修订财务计划，社员们又受到一次实际的爱国爱社教育。全社正大力开展冬季生产，还拿出了一万五千斤余粮卖给国家，并准备在麦收以后再卖给国家二万斤麦子。
    发动社员向社投资
    自力更生克服困难
    本报讯　江苏建湖县南郑农业社，发动社员向社投资，为麦收前准备了足够的生产资金。
    这个社去年因为对决分工作缺乏经验，没有留下适当的生产资金；决分以后社里只留下七百多元。因此，管委会和党分支部决定发动社员自由投资，自力更生克服困难。党分支部首先打通有经济力量的党员的思想，带头向社里投资，并依靠社员中的积极分子，对社员细致地进行了投资搞好生产的教育。经过深入的思想动员以后，全社有一百零八户自动投资二千七百七十七元，解决了生产资金不足的困难。当地中共区委认为这个社发动社员 投资的经验很好，把它介绍给全区各个农业社。现在，全区三十七个农业社共发动社员投资七万多元，为春耕春种做好了资金准备工作。
    难题难不住群众
  同群众商量就有办法
    本报讯　福建龙溪县古县农业社在全年分配决算中，遇到了一个难题——“有账无钱”。1956年财务决算的结果，应有二十五万五千九百多元分给社员，但是现在却有三万八千七百多元因为没有现钱，分不下去了。其中，有两万二千多元被社里的副业和各种投资占用了，另外有价值一万多元的农产品没有出卖。许多社员担心钱拿不到手，不愿意在社里生产，自己去从事副业生产。
    社务管理委员会召开了社员大会，向社员们说明实际困难，并同大家商量解决这个问题的办法。大家认为：已经投到畜牧业里的钱，目前不宜抽回，因为猪、鸡还在生长的时候，不应该把它们卖掉。大家提出的解决办法是：一、先把社里储存的一部分粮食和别的农产品卖出去，把从这得来的一万两千七百多元现钱分给社员；二、因为劳动报酬没有全部领回以致无法归还信用合作社的贷款者，由合作社负责归还；假如合作社目前无法归还，再和信用社协商延长贷款归还期限，利息由农业社负担；三、发动社员把暂时不用的钱存入农业社里做生产资金，等到社里的鱼苗出卖以后还给社员，利息照信用社存款一样付给。现在，社员们已把一万七千九百七十多元余款投到社里。难题就这样解决了。
