    Un-American Ways
    A certain American millionaire, whose wealth was known to have dubious origins, asked a famous painter to paint his portrait. The portrait was completed, depicting him with his hands in his pockets, looking quite dignified. He wanted a guest to see his portrait and asked if the guest thought it looked like him.
    "Not at all," the guest said, "I don't think it looks like you."
    "Why doesn't it look like me?"
    "You have your hands in your own pockets, that's what doesn't look like you."
    (Translated by Ji Kun from the German "Book of Humor") (With picture)

    非美国方式
    有一位美国百万富翁，他的财富来路不清是尽人皆知的。他请一位著名的画家给他画一幅肖像。肖像画成了，像上的他两手插在衣袋里，神气俨然。他要一位客人参观他的肖像。问客人是否觉得画得很像。
    “不然，”客人说，“我看不像。”
    “为什么不像？”
    “您把手伸进自己的口袋里，这就不像您了。”
    （纪琨译自德文“谐趣集”）（附图片）
