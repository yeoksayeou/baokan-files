The coal mine workers across the country enthusiastically responded to the call of the State Council during the Spring Festival this year, sacrificing two days of holiday to increase coal production by more than 450,000 tons for the country and completing loading and transportation tasks of more than 485,800 tons. The completion of this task greatly alleviated the tension in coal supply in the first quarter of our country. This is a major victory in the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy, and a glorious contribution of our country's coal mine workers on the production front.

After the State Council's call reached the coal mines on January 27, the coal mine workers were highly enthusiastic. In order to respond to the call of the State Council, many young workers who were preparing to get married during the Spring Festival postponed their weddings; many workers who had already bought train tickets to go home for the Spring Festival returned their tickets; many workers who had already returned home automatically returned to the mines after hearing the call of the State Council; many families of miners actively mobilized their husbands and sons to ensure full attendance during the festival. Therefore, the attendance rate of each coal mine during the Spring Festival generally reached more than 85% of all employees, and some even reached 100%.

The coal mine workers who persisted in production during the Spring Festival worked even harder than usual. In order to improve productivity, many work teams launched challenge competitions, and many workers put forward guarantee conditions based on their own tasks. Most coal mines across the country maintained their usual production levels. Coal mines in Jingxi, Haizhou, Taiyuan, Tianfu and other places even exceeded the average daily output in January. In order to ensure the smooth production of direct production workers, non-production personnel were also widely mobilized. Catering staff made more varied and better-tasting meals than usual; most of the office staff went deep into the mines with the workers to check safety conditions, organize material supply, and arrange production preparation work; the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Coal Mine Trade Union also dispatched a large number of cadres, led by responsible comrades, to various mines to provide assistance and condolences. Now, the coal mine workers across the country have safely completed the glorious task assigned to them by the Party and the state. This action fully demonstrates the spirit of the Chinese working class in loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving labor. It is hoped that all employees will continue to work hard and maintain this glorious tradition.

The successful completion of the task of increasing coal production for the country during the Spring Festival by coal mine workers is inseparable from the strong cooperation of workers in other fields. During the Spring Festival, the power industry workers ensured the electricity supply for the coal industry, the railway workers supplied sufficient wagons, the forestry industry departments supplied a large number of sleepers, and the trade departments ensured the supply of production materials. It should be particularly mentioned that in order to complete the task of loading during the festival, some coal mines in Northeast China mobilized a large number of farmers to assist in handling through the agricultural production cooperatives near the coal mines. Therefore, the loading efficiency reached 80% to 90% of the usual, while the loading volume during the festival in previous years only reached 30% to 40% of the usual. Therefore, while congratulating the coal mine workers on the successful completion of their tasks, we also express our congratulations to all the workers, farmers, and staff who persisted in production during the Spring Festival. We hope that the workers on other fronts will learn from the coal mine workers and other employees who persisted in working during the Spring Festival, and learn from their fine qualities of sacrificing their personal immediate interests and striving to create wealth for the country and the people, as well as their revolutionary spirit of hard work, and wish everyone to fight for the successful completion of the 1957 production tasks.

The persistence of coal mine workers in production during the Spring Festival and the increase in coal production for the country have eased the tense coal supply situation in the first quarter. Such a brilliant example shows that the difficulties in our country's socialist construction are difficulties in progress and are temporary difficulties. As long as we can face up to these difficulties and explain the difficulties to the masses, pool our wisdom and efforts, and share weal and woe, any difficulties can be gradually overcome. However, we must never relax and become complacent because of this. At present, the easing of the coal supply situation is only temporary, and long-term efforts are needed to fundamentally change the situation of coal supply falling short of demand. From the current situation of coal mine production, the output of old mines has increased significantly after a comprehensive production reform. However, the unbalanced phenomena such as exploration lagging behind tunneling, tunneling lagging behind coal mining, and transportation not keeping up with coal mining have not been fundamentally changed. The level of technical management and the degree of improvement of workers' skills are far from keeping up with the requirements of production development. The maintenance and repair of machinery is very poor, the utilization rate is not high, and advanced methods such as regular cyclic operation in production have not been widely promoted. Newly put into production mines should also take active measures to improve their production capacity. These problems must be actively resolved.

In the future, on the basis of further improving management level and technical level, ensuring quality and paying attention to safety, consolidating and promoting the enthusiasm for production is a prerequisite for coal miners across the country to continue to carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy and to overproduce coal for the country. It is hoped that coal mine workers across the country will continue to work hard, guard against arrogance and impatience, prevent slackness, maintain attendance rate, do a good job in production preparation, strengthen maintenance work, strive to improve the production conditions of old mines, and improve the production capacity of new mines, in order to tap potential and implement the campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the year's production.

### 煤矿职工的贡献

    煤矿职工的贡献
    今年春节期间，全国煤矿职工热烈地响应了国务院的号召，牺牲了两天假日，为国家增产了煤炭四十五万多吨，完成装车运输任务四十八万五千八百多吨。由于这一任务的完成，使我国第一季度煤炭供应的紧张情况大大减轻。这是全国增产节约运动中的一个重大的胜利，这是我国煤矿职工在生产战线上的光荣贡献。
    当国务院的号召在1月27日下达到各煤矿以后，煤矿职工们热情高涨。为了响应国务院的号召，有许多在春节准备结婚的青年职工推迟了自己的婚期；有许多已经买好车票打算回家过春节的职工退掉了车票；有许多已经回到家里的职工，听到国务院号召后，又自动返回矿山；有许多矿工家属，积极动员自己的丈夫和儿子，保证节日全勤。因此，各煤矿在春节期间的出勤人数一般都达到全体职工85％以上，有一部分达到百分之百。
    在春节期间坚持生产的煤矿职工们，干活比平时更加起劲。为了提高生产率，许多班组之间展开了挑战竞赛，许多工人都根据自己的任务提出了保证条件。全国绝大部分煤矿都保持了平时的生产水平。京西、海州、太原、天府等煤矿还超过了一月份平均的日产量。为了保证直接生产的工人得以顺利生产，非生产人员也广泛地动员起来。炊事人员做饭菜比平时花样更多、味道更好；科室工作人员大部分都深入矿井同工人在一起，检查安全情况，组织材料供应，安排生产准备工作；煤炭工业部和煤矿工会也出动了大批干部，在负责同志带领下分头到各矿进行帮助和慰问。现在，全国煤矿职工安全地完成了党和国家交给他们的光荣任务。这种行动充分表现了我国工人阶级热爱祖国、热爱人民、热爱劳动的精神。希望全体职工，继续努力，保持这种光荣的传统。
    煤矿职工胜利完成了春节为国家增产煤炭的任务，是同其他方面职工的有力配合分不开的。在春节期间，电业工人们保证了煤炭工业的用电，铁路职工供给了足够的车皮，森林工业部门供应了大量的枕木，贸易部门保证了生产用品的供应。特别应该提到的是：在东北有些煤矿为了完成节日装车任务，曾通过煤矿附近的农业生产合作社动员大批农民协助搬运，因此，使装车效率达到平日的80％到90％，而往年节日的装车量仅达到平日的30％到40％。因此，我们在祝贺煤矿职工胜利完成任务的时候，也向在春节期间坚持生产的一切工人、农民和职员们表示祝贺，希望其他各个战线上的职工向煤矿职工和春节期间坚持工作的其他职工学习，学习他们这种牺牲自己个人眼前利益、努力为国家为人民创造财富的优良品质和艰苦奋斗的革命精神，并预祝大家为胜利完成1957年的生产任务而斗争。
    煤矿职工在春节期间坚持生产，为国家增产了煤炭，使第一季度煤炭供应紧张情况已经得到缓和。这样一个光辉的范例说明：我国在社会主义建设中的困难是前进中的困难，是暂时的困难。只要我们能够正视这种困难，并把困难情况向群众讲清楚，群策群力，同甘共苦，任何困难都可以逐步得到克服。但是，我们绝不能因此松懈和自满起来。目前，煤炭供应情况的缓和仅仅是暂时的缓和，煤炭供不应求的情况要想从根本上转变过来，还需要作长期的努力。从煤矿生产现状来看，旧有矿井经过全面的生产改革以后，产量已经有了显著增加。但是，勘探落后于掘进、掘进落后于采煤、运输赶不上采煤等不平衡的现象仍然没有根本改变。技术管理的水平和工人技术提高的程度，还远远赶不上生产发展的要求。机械的维护和检修工作作得很差，利用率不高，生产中的正规循环作业等先进方法还没有普遍推广。新投入生产的矿井还应该采取积极措施提高它们的生产能力。这些问题都是必须积极解决的。
    今后在进一步提高管理水平和技术水平、在保证质量和注重安全的基础上，巩固和发扬生产的积极性，这是全国煤矿工人继续开展增产节约运动、为国家更多地超额生产煤炭的先决条件。希望全国煤矿职工继续努力，戒骄戒躁，防止松懈，保持出勤率，作好生产准备工作，加强检修工作，努力改善旧有矿井的生产条件，提高新矿井的生产能力，以便挖掘潜力，把增产节约运动贯彻到全年的生产中去。
