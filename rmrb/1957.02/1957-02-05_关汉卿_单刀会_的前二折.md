Guan Hanqing's "Single Blade Meeting" - The First Two Acts Li Jianwu

This is a dramatic masterpiece. Among the world's dramatic masterpieces I have read, the Zaju "Lord Guan's Solo Journey to the Single Blade Meeting" is probably the most structurally simple and the most concise in its technique. Overall, it can even be said to be so plain that the first two acts seem almost superfluous. For example, in general performances, it only starts from the third act (rewritten). Are they really superfluous? Guan Hanqing, who wrote plays all his life and wrote many masterpieces, why bother writing these first two acts? Is it just to satisfy the four-act format that he added these first two acts?

I dare not believe that he would abuse his writing in this way.

Before delving deeply into the question I raised myself, I would like to point out the shortcomings of the first two acts themselves. The shortcomings are significant and very obvious. First, it does not conform to the actual situation of the characters; therefore, second, it does not conform to historical facts, and sometimes cannot be compensated; therefore, third, the beginning does not match the end. Lu Su set a plan to invite Guan Yu to cross the river to a banquet, taking the opportunity to demand Jingzhou. If Guan Yu refused, he would imprison him. Lu Su hoped to hear other people's opinions before implementing the plan. Thus, we have the first two acts in the plot.

The first act is about his invitation to Qiao Guolao (the father-in-law of Sun Ce and Zhou Yu) to the marshal's residence for a talk. Guolao asked Lu Su: "Do you know about the burning of the camp at Bowang?" The answer was "This minor official does not know. Old Prime Minister, please tell me." Lu Su's "does not know" is already very strange, but when Guolao asked him if he knew about the battle of wits across the river, he replied: "...This minor official knows if I know, but not in detail, Old Prime Minister, please tell me," which is even stranger. The playwright clearly knows that Lu Su was one of the main players in the Battle of Red Cliffs, bearing the brunt, but he wants Guolao, who was not involved, to "try to tell" it again, which is a bit too careless. People with historical knowledge, people who have heard Pinghua (at that time, the complete "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" did not yet exist), will feel that these two people are either fools, or one is pretending to be a fool. This Commander Lu is really ignorant and ridiculous. As a commander, confronting the enemy across the river, he actually knows nothing about the enemy's life, saying: "What ability does he have?" Perhaps he is underestimating Guan Yu, deliberately saying this.

After receiving a boring answer from Qiao Guolao, he decided to go to the countryside to visit Guan Yu's old friend Sima Hui to understand Guan Yu's "wisdom, courage, and strategy, and his virtues in wine." This act has the same simple layout as the previous act, but it adds a bit of comedic tone to reconcile the serious atmosphere of the play. Sima Hui first agreed to attend the banquet, but immediately refused when he heard that the host and guest were Guan Yu, saying: "This poor Taoist's wind disease has flared up, I cannot go, I cannot go." He believes that Guan Yu "has a volatile temper in wine and cannot be provoked," advising Lu Su not to mention "demanding Jingzhou" during the banquet. Lu Su plans to "hide armored soldiers in the walls and capture Lord Guan." Then Sima Hui described Zhuge Liang's ingenious calculations and the bravery of the Five Tiger Generals, especially recounting Guan Yu's heroic deeds again.

These two scenes have a common technique, that is, Qiao Guolao and Sima Hui stated Guan Yu's prestige and immediately exited the stage, without saying a single word more to Lu Su.

Analyzing to this point, I believe the wonderfulness of these first two acts is already emerging. Before fully revealing it, we might as well look at whether the so-called shortcomings are actually shortcomings from another angle.

We cannot imagine that a great writer like Guan Hanqing would糊里糊涂write Lu Su so lacking in memory, or so ignorant (although he intentionally wanted to write him as an overestimating character), and thus so far removed from historical truth.

The problem is that he is facing a more important truth, and he is forced to deal with it, that is: his plays are performed for the broad masses of people, among whom there are more illiterates. We intellectuals have read "Records of the Three Kingdoms," and also read "Pinghua" about "Records of the Three Kingdoms," especially Luo Guanzhong's "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Since then, Three Kingdoms operas have been frequently staged, and even illiterates can talk about Three Kingdoms stories like counting family treasures. But we are in today's time. Assuming we lived in the Guan Hanqing era, in the era when the Mongolian nation ruled China, the situation would obviously be different. For Guan Hanqing, establishing Guan Yu's heroic image in the hearts of his beloved illiterate audience was of paramount importance. Lu Su's "does not know" or "not in detail," asking "Old Prime Minister, please tell me," is actually serving the audience. Lu Su here is both a character on stage and a representative of the audience off stage. Guan Hanqing's approach, to some extent, damages the historical authenticity of Lu Su's character, but the broad illiterate audience will be grateful for his kindness. He is not a study playwright. Like Shakespeare and Molière, he "personally participated in performances, applying makeup to his face, taking it as his family's livelihood, and not refusing to be an actor" (——Zang Jinshu's "Selected Yuan Dramas" Preface Two), always standing from the audience's perspective and considering the dramatic effect. Their techniques come from practice, and later generations must also understand their artistic achievements from a practical starting point, as Chairman Mao instructed.

It is also combined for the sake of drama. Because through the introduction of Guan Yu, in the progress of the drama, it also plays two major roles, one directly reflected in Lu Su's (the person concerned) psychology, making him have to say at the end of the second act: "After listening to what the gentleman said, it makes me a little scared." Despite the fear, he still acts according to the plan, because "demanding Jingzhou" is his duty that he must do. The other is directly reflected in the audience's psychology, making the audience feel as if they have seen the person and heard the voice before Guan Yu appears on stage. These two acts create an atmosphere and become a foil, completing the preparatory work before the main character appears on stage. Thus, Lu Su's character is reflected in other people's descriptions of Guan Yu's heroic deeds; Guan Yu's character also has a spiritual foundation through descriptions. The contrast is also completed here.

This is a eulogistic drama where the main character (Guan Yu) appears relatively late, and as soon as he appears, he brings the play into a climax. We have only seen this kind of delayed appearance of the main character in the 17th-century comedic masterpiece "Tartuffe" (or translated as "The Hypocrite"). Molière's Tartuffe appears late in the third act. After much anticipation, he finally appears, and as soon as he appears, it's all drama, and everything falls into place. The audience is already impatient. Guan Hanqing also understands this audience psychology and also completes this dramatic effect in the Zaju style, although one is a eulogistic drama, and the main character is a hero, while the other is a comedy, and the main character is a villain, but the techniques are similar.

However, our Guan Hanqing lived in the 13th century.

Modern general performances (adaptations) only perform the latter two acts, focusing on the actor's (Guan Yu) appearance and the climax of the drama. This may be done in opera, and in fact it is done this way, but in terms of the overall arrangement of the drama, it would be a pity to fail the playwright's ingenuity.

The entire heroic eulogistic drama is simple, powerful, contrasting, and has excellent effects, showing Guan Hanqing's versatile and unparalleled talent for writing plays. The layout has layers, the progress is rapid, the lines are straightforward, the momentum is magnificent, the ending is clear, and the lyrics are natural and bold. In terms of the heroic eulogistic drama style, it is indeed an eternal masterpiece. At the beginning, he used Qiao Guolao to sing the people's desire for peace: "Turning weapons into agricultural implements." He shaped Guan Yu's heroic character, praising him in the middle, but also pointed out that "that man's inferior nature would never admit even losing half a point." And the third act directly writes about Guan Yu's prestige, but also writes about his excessive self-confidence and arrogance. The elegiac singing on the bow of the boat in the fourth act deepens the character's warmth.

Guan Hanqing only has this one eulogistic drama passed down to future generations. Such eulogistic dramas are also rare in the Yuan operas that have been passed down to today. The Writer Publishing House's "Selected Yuan Dynasty Zaju" only selects his worldly dramas (comedies and tragedies), which seems unfair to him and to Yuan operas.

Note: "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" writes about the "Single Blade Meeting" in just a few paragraphs, which are also very excellent, especially when the banquet is about to end, Guan Yu angrily scolds Zhou Cang, "seizing the broadsword held by Zhou Cang," which is extremely insightful of Guan Yu's wit.

"Records of the Three Kingdoms Pinghua" writes it plainly and unremarkable. The Peking Opera "Single Blade Meeting," just listening to a few lyrics sung by Guan Yu on the bow of the boat, is far inferior to Guan Hanqing's application of Su Dongpo's lyrics and fu, with sound, color, and style. "Lord Guan's Solo Journey to the Single Blade Meeting" this eulogistic drama, in terms of realm, reminds us of the ancient Greek tragedy "Prometheus Bound," and only "Prometheus Bound" can be compared with it, although the stories, themes, layouts, and characters are completely different.

The "Single Blade Meeting" drama lyrics cited in this article are from "Rare Yuan and Ming Zaju" (published by Shanghai Hanfenlou) Volume 2.

### 关汉卿“单刀会”的前二折

    关汉卿“单刀会”的前二折	李健吾
    这是一出戏剧杰作。在我读过的世界戏剧杰作中，“关大王独赴单刀会”这出杂剧，怕是结构最单纯，手法最简练的了，整个看来，甚至于可以说素朴到了这样一种地步，觉得前二折近乎多余，例如一般演出，就只从第三折（改写过）开始。真就多余吗？写了一辈子戏的关汉卿，写了许多杰作，又何苦写这前二折呢？难道只是为了满足四折形式，才添上这前二折吗？
    我不敢相信他会这样滥用他的笔墨。
    在没有深入我对自己提出来的问题以前，我愿意先指出前二折本身的缺点。缺点很大，还很显著。首先，不合人物实际情况；因而其次，不合历史事实，有时候弥补也弥补不了；因而其三，前言不对后语。鲁肃定计请关羽过江赴宴，乘机索取荆州，关羽如若不肯，就把他拘囚起来。鲁肃希望在行计之前，听听别人的意见。这样我们在情节上就有了前二折。
    第一折是他邀请乔国老（孙策和周瑜的岳父）过帅府一谈。国老问鲁肃：“你知博望烧屯那一事么。”回答是“小官不知。老相公试说者。”鲁肃会“不知”，已经非常可怪了，而国老问他知否隔江斗智一事，他却回答：“……小官知便知道，不得详细，老相公试说者”，就更可怪了。剧作者明知鲁肃是赤壁大战主角之一，身当其冲，反要不预其事的国老“试说”一遍，未免过于大意。有历史知识的人，听过平话（当时完整的“三国演义”还不存在）的人，会觉得这两个人不是一个是傻瓜，就是一个是装傻。这个鲁元帅实在无知可笑。身为元帅，和敌人隔江对峙，竟然对敌人生平一无所知，说：“他便有甚本事”，他也许是小看关羽，故作此语罢。
    他在乔国老面前讨了一场无趣，决定下乡寻访关羽的旧友司马徽，了解一下关羽的“知勇谋略，酒中德性”。这一折和前一折一样布局单纯，但是进行上添了一点喜剧情调，调和戏的严肃空气。司马徽先是答应赴宴，一听主客是关羽，立即回绝，说：“贫道风疾举发，去不的，去不的。”他认为关羽“酒性躁，不中撩斗”，劝鲁肃酒席间千万不要说起“索取荆州”。鲁肃打算“壁间暗藏甲士，擒住关公”。于是司马徽形容了一番诸葛亮神机妙算和五虎将勇猛难当，特别把关羽他的英雄事迹再交代一遍。
    这两场戏有一个相同的手法，就是乔国老与司马徽表过关羽声威，立即下场，半句话也不多和鲁肃应酬。
    分析到这里，我相信这前二折戏的妙处，已经跃然欲出了。在没有完全说破以前，我们不妨从另一个角度，看看所谓缺点是否就是缺点。
      我们不能想像，关汉卿这样的大作家，会糊里糊涂把鲁肃写得那样没有记性，或者那样孤陋寡闻
  （虽然他有意要把他写成一个不自量力的人物），因而那样远离历史的真实。
    问题是他面对着一个更重要的真实，而且迫使他必须加以应付，那就是：他的戏是演给广大人民看的，他们中间更多的是文盲。我们知识分子读过“三国志”，也读过关于“三国志”的“平话”，尤其是罗贯中的“三国演义”。此后三国戏经常上演，就是文盲，说起三国故事来，也如数家珍了。不过我们是在今天。假定我们活在关汉卿时代，在蒙古民族统治中国时代，情形却就显然不同了。对关汉卿说来，在他的亲爱的文盲观众的心里，建立关羽的英雄形象，有首要意义。鲁肃的“不知”或者“不得详细”，请“老相公试说者”，实际是为观众服务。鲁肃在这里一方面是台上人物，一方面也代表台下观众。关汉卿这样作，多少给鲁肃这一人物的历史真实性带来了损害，然而广大的文盲观众却会感激他的厚谊的。他不是书斋剧作家。他像莎士比亚、莫里哀一样，“躬践排场，面傅粉墨，以为我家生活，偶倡优而不辞”（——臧晋叔“元曲选”序二），时刻站在观众立场，考虑戏剧效果。他们的技巧从实际中来，后人领会他们的艺术成就，也必须像毛主席所指示，从实际出发。
    同时也结合着为了戏剧。因为通过对关羽的介绍，在戏剧进行上，还起了两个大作用，一个直接反映在鲁肃（当事人）的心理上，使他在第二折末尾不得不说：“我听那先生说了这一会，交（叫）我也怕上来了。”怕尽管怕，他仍然依计而行，因为“索取荆州”是他非作不可的分内事。另一个直接反映在观众的心理上，在关羽未登场之前，使观众有如见其人、如闻其声的感觉。这二折戏制造气氛，成为烘托，完成了主要人物登场之前的准备工作。于是鲁肃的性格，在别人形容关羽的英雄事迹上，得到了反映；关羽的性格，通过形容，也有了一种精神基础。对比同时在这里也完成了。
    这是主要人物（关羽）出场较迟的一出颂剧，而一出场就把戏带进了高潮。像这样不尽早放主要人物出场的，我们只在十七世纪的喜剧杰作“达尔杜弗”（或译为“伪君子”）看到过。莫里哀的达尔杜弗迟到第三幕露面。千呼万唤始出来，一出来就是戏，水到渠成，观众已经迫不及待了。关汉卿同样了解这种观众心理，同样在杂剧方式中完成了这种戏剧效果，虽然一个是颂剧，主要人物是英雄，而另一个是喜剧，主要人物是恶棍，不过技巧却是相似的。
    然而我们的关汉卿，活在十三世纪。
    近代一般演出（改编），只演后二折，把重点放在演员（关羽）登场和戏剧进行的高潮上，在歌剧上也许可以这样作，事实上也这样作了，不过就戏剧全盘的安排而言，未免辜负剧作者的匠心。
    整个这出英雄颂剧，素朴有力，对比鲜明，效果卓越，显出了关汉卿写戏的多样的盖世才华。布局有层次，进行迅速，线条率直，气势雄浑，收煞明朗，唱词自然豪放，就英雄颂剧一格而言，确是千古绝唱。他一开头，就利用乔国老唱出了人民热望和平的心愿：“兵器改为农器用”。他塑造关羽的英雄性格，表扬中间，也指出了“那汉劣性怎肯道折了半筹”。而第三折直写关羽声威，也写出了他过分自信的骄傲。第四折在船头吊古伤今的歌咏，又加深了性格的温润。
    关汉卿只有这样一出颂剧传留后世，这样的颂剧，在传留到今天的元曲中，也不多见。作家出版社的“元人杂剧选”只选他的世态剧（喜剧与悲剧），对他，对元曲，似乎都不怎么公道。
    附注：“三国演义”写“单刀会”，寥寥数段，也很出色，特别是宴会将毕，关羽怒斥周仓，“夺周仓所捧大刀”，极见关羽机智。
    “三国志平话”却写来平平无奇了。京剧的“单刀会”，单听关羽船头几句唱词，就远不及关汉卿套用苏东坡的词、赋，有声，有色，有格调“关大王独赴单刀会”这出颂剧，在境界上，让我们想到古代希腊悲剧“浦罗米修斯被绑”，也只有“浦罗米修斯被绑”能和它相提并论，虽然故事、主题、布局、人物迥不相同。
