Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 10th: Our correspondent Li Yanning reports: On February 8th, miner's conferences or coal mine staff conferences were held in many major coal regions of Czechoslovakia to mobilize coal miners to increase coal production in order to overcome the difficulties faced this year in coal supply.

On this day, Republic President Zápotocký, Premier Široký, National Assembly Chairman Fierlinger, CCP Central Committee Secretary Hendrych, and others, respectively participated in the miner's conferences in major coal regions such as East Bohemia, Ostrava, Kladno, and Zbůch, and delivered speeches.

Premier Široký said at the miner's conference held in Ostrava that, this year, and perhaps in the next few years, the coal problem is a key issue in the development of the Czechoslovak national economy. Due to the lack of coal, certain reductions have to be made in production, and the potential of enterprises cannot be fully utilized. Under the current circumstances where it is impossible to import more coal, the further development of the entire national economy this year and in the coming years depends primarily on the increased production of domestic coal mines. He called on coal mining areas to implement plans evenly from the beginning of each month, while also saving manpower and adopting mechanized and advanced methods, which is the correct path to improving labor productivity.

Since the beginning of this year, the Czechoslovak government has taken a series of measures to mobilize coal miners to increase coal production. The situation of tight coal supply has arisen because the increase in coal production has not kept pace with the rapid development of industry. Between 1950 and 1956, Czechoslovakia's total coal production increased by 54.3%. Last year, national coal production increased by 11% compared to 1955, exceeding the plan by 800,000 tons. Despite this, coal production still cannot meet the needs of industrial development. The large-scale construction of the second five-year plan, which began last year, requires this year's coal production to rapidly catch up with the demand. The factors that directly affect the imbalance of coal production and consumption this year are primarily the reduction in imported coal. Due to insufficient coal production in Poland and reduced exports, Czechoslovakia will not be able to import the required coal from Poland this year as it has in the past.

In order to achieve a balance between coal supply and demand by relying on the increased production of domestic coal mines, the Czechoslovak government and the Communist Party are striving to lead the people to overcome the shortcomings in raw coal production, such as excessive miner turnover and absenteeism, and the low utilization rate of machinery. At the same time, the government is also calling on the people to conserve coal consumption.

The measures taken by the Czechoslovak government to increase coal production have yielded results. In January of this year, national coal mines exceeded the plan by 130,000 tons. In this month, a youth miner group in Ostrava Oblast used a Soviet "Donbas" type coal mining combine to mine 27,287 tons of coal, which is 256 tons more than the monthly output of the Soviet miner group, the original world record holder.

    捷政府动员矿工增加煤产量
    西罗基指出今后几年经济发展有赖于煤的增产
    新华社布拉格10日电　本社记者李延宁报道：2月8日，捷克斯洛伐克许多主要煤区都举行了矿工大会或煤矿工作人员大会，动员煤矿工人增加煤产量以克服今年面临的煤的供应方面的困难。
    在这一天，共和国总统萨波托斯基、总理西罗基、国民议会主席费林格、捷共中央书记亨德里赫等人，分别参加了东波希米亚、俄斯特拉发、克拉德诺和兹布契等主要煤区的矿工大会，并且发表了演说。
    西罗基总理在俄斯特拉发举行的矿工大会上说，在今年，也许还在今后几年，煤的问题是捷克斯洛伐克国民经济发展中的一个关键性问题。由于缺乏煤，不得不在生产方面作某些减缩，企业的潜力得不到充分的利用。在目前不可能输入更多的煤的情况下，今年和今后几年中整个国民经济的进一步发展，首先有赖于国内煤矿的增产。他号召煤矿区从每月的月初起就要均衡地执行计划，同时要节省人力，还要采用机械化的和先进的方法，这是提高劳动生产率的正确道路。
    今年年初以来，捷克斯洛伐克政府就采取了一系列的措施，来动员煤矿工人增加煤产量。而煤的供应紧张的情况，是在煤的增产跟不上工业迅速发展的情况下产生的。在1950年到1956年间，捷克斯洛伐克煤产量总共增加了54.3％，去年全国煤产量又比1955年增加了11％，超额八十万吨完成了计划。尽管这样，煤产量还是不能满足工业发展的需要。从去年开始的第二个五年计划的大规模建设，更要求今年的煤产量迅速地赶上要求。而直接影响到今年煤的生产和消费的不平衡的因素，首先是进口煤的减少。由于波兰煤产量不足和出口的削减，捷克斯洛伐克今年就不能够像往年那样从波兰进口所需要的煤。
    为了依靠本国煤矿的增产来达到煤炭供求的平衡，捷克斯洛伐克政府和共产党正在努力领导人民克服原煤生产中的缺点，如矿工的流动和缺勤过多，以及机械的利用率不高等。同时，政府还在号召人民节约煤的消费。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府采取的增加煤产量的措施，已经收到了成果。在今年1月份，全国煤矿超额十三万吨完成了计划。俄斯特拉发州的一个青年矿工小组在这一月曾经使用苏联“顿巴斯”式采煤联合机采掘了二万七千二百八十七吨煤，比原来的世界纪录保持者——苏联矿工小组的月产量多二百五十六吨。
