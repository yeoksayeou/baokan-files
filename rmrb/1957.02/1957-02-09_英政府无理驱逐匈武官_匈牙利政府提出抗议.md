Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, February 7th. The Hungarian People's Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with the British government on February 5th against the British government's unreasonable expulsion of the Hungarian military attaché in Britain.

The note pointed out that this measure was a retaliation for the legal expulsion of British military attaché in Hungary, Cowley, from Hungarian territory. The note reiterated Cowley's activities in Hungary of conspiring and plotting a counter-revolutionary coup in Hungary, and refuted the British government's note whitewashing Cowley. The Hungarian note pointed out that the purpose of the British government's note was to divert public attention from Cowley's activities in Hungary, and the British government's retaliatory action was unreasonable.

    英政府无理驱逐匈武官
    匈牙利政府提出抗议
    新华社布达佩斯7日电　匈牙利人民共和国外交部2月5日照会英国政府，抗议英国政府无理把匈牙利驻英国使馆武官驱逐出境。
    照会指出，这种措施是对英国驻匈牙利使馆武官考莱被合法驱逐出匈牙利国境一事的报复。照会再次列举了考莱在匈牙利阴谋策划匈牙利反革命政变的活动，驳斥了英国政府为考莱洗刷的照会。匈牙利照会指出，英国政府照会的目的是要转移公众对考莱在匈牙利的活动的注意，英国政府的报复行动是毫无道理的。
