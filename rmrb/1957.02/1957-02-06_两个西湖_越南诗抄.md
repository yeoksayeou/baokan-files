    Two West Lakes
    ——Vietnamese Poetry Excerpt 	Sun Bin
    It is said there is such a story:
    Two celestial maidens were sisters,
    Their loving mother, hiding it from their father,
    Allowed them to travel to the human world.
    The human world was indeed more interesting than heaven,
    Green hills and clear waters, every household,
    Every man and woman they met were lovely,
    Unlike the coldness and indifference of heaven.
    Where in heaven is there such music,
    The singing of hundreds of birds in the woods,
    Where in heaven is there such a painting,
    Brilliant flowers blooming all over the earth.
    Shining waterfalls hanging between the mountains,
    Roaring torrents rushing in the rivers,
    Long winds running across the wilderness,
    Antelopes revealing a pair of eyes in the grass…
    However, they were not satisfied with what they saw—
    It seemed something was always missing,
    The allotted time arrived,
    They were still calculating,
    What to leave in the human world to make up for it.
    They casually left behind two dressing mirrors,
    These mirrors transformed into two West Lakes in the human world;
    One West Lake is in Hangzhou, China,
    One West Lake is in Hanoi, Vietnam.

    两个西湖
    ——越南诗抄 	孙滨
    据说有这样一个故事，
    天上有两个仙女是姊妹，
    慈爱的妈妈瞒过了父亲，
    允许她们到人间去旅行。
    人间确比天上有趣，
    青山绿水，家家户户，
    凡是遇到的男女都可爱，
    不像天上的冷冷冰冰。
    天上哪来这样的音乐，
    树林里百鸟的歌声，
    天上哪来这样的图画，
    灿烂的百花开满大地。
    山间悬着耀眼的瀑布，
    江里奔腾着喧哗的洪波，
    长风在旷野上奔跑，
    羚羊在草丛里露出一对眼睛……
    可是，她们看了还不满足——
    仿佛总还缺少点什么，
    限定的时刻到了，
    她们还在盘算，
    留点什么给人间来弥补。
    她们顺手留下两面梳妆的镜子，
    这镜子在人间就变成两个西湖；
    一个西湖在中国的杭州，
    一个西湖在越南的河内。
