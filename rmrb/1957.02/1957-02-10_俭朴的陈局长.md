　　"Are you asking about our bureau chief? Everyone in the bureau feels that he is just as hardworking and simple as he was in the military," said Comrade Chen Zengfa, administrator of the Cixi County Military Service Bureau in Zhejiang Province, as he and I discussed the model deeds of frugality and simplicity of Chen Yongdi, the bureau chief.

　　He was very familiar with Bureau Chief Chen's life. He could count the number of suits Bureau Chief Chen had. He said, "Most of these clothes were issued by the government when the supply system was in place. There is a set of uniforms that has faded beyond recognition. The bureau chief had it dyed and put it on again."

　　Bureau Chief Chen seemed tireless. Chen Zengfa always got up early every morning, but Bureau Chief Chen got up even earlier than him. And at night, when Chen Zengfa went to his dormitory to sleep at 11 o'clock, the light in Bureau Chief Chen's office was still on!

　　Bureau Chief Chen also had a different temperament from others. He made his own tea, fetched water, and bought meals. He never wanted to trouble anyone. Once, Bureau Chief Chen went to Ningbo for a meeting and carried a bag to the railway station. A communicator saw him and wanted to carry the bag for Bureau Chief Chen. Bureau Chief Chen insisted on carrying it himself. The two argued for a while. Later, Bureau Chief Chen put on a stern face, and the communicator had no choice but to leave. The communicators in the bureau all said: Encountering a leader like Bureau Chief Chen means less work to do.

　　Chen Zengfa had also encountered unpleasant things in front of Bureau Chief Chen: Whenever the bureau's financial plan or a certain expenditure was submitted to Bureau Chief Chen for approval, it would always be rejected, making Chen Zengfa feel very embarrassed. At this time, Bureau Chief Chen would earnestly tell him: Public money must not be spent lavishly. In the past, during the war years, every penny had to be carefully calculated. Take it back and re-calculate it carefully!

　　Not only Chen Zengfa felt this deeply, but other comrades in the bureau also had a deeper understanding. Another comrade told me the following:

　　As early as 1954, when Bureau Chief Chen had just been transferred to the Military Service Bureau, county-level agencies were moving from Cicheng Town to Xushan. Many units felt that housing was scarce. The Military Service Bureau had more than 30 cadres but only got five or six rooms, which were not even enough for offices. Some people had to sleep in the corridor. What to do? Bureau Chief Chen immediately came up with an idea: There were six houses nearby, which, although dilapidated, could be barely habitable with some repairs. He suggested this to the County Finance Section, which allocated 800 yuan for the repair of the houses. Then, he called a few carpenters and masons and mobilized the cadres in the bureau to participate in voluntary labor. He himself also worked with everyone. A few days later, the six dilapidated houses were finally repaired and used as residences for the cadres. Bureau Chief Chen chose a small room for himself, which served as both an office and a bedroom. Because his family did not have a place to live, he tried to have them live separately outside. It was not until October of last year, when the bureau built new offices and the original offices were used as dormitories, that Bureau Chief Chen's family moved into the bureau.

　　Also in 1954, in order to take care of Bureau Chief Chen's work and health, the leadership gave him a bicycle. This was originally a very ordinary thing, but Bureau Chief Chen never rode the bicycle. When people asked him why he didn't ride the bicycle, he said: "I am very grateful to the leadership for taking care of me, but now everyone doesn't have a bicycle. Let the communicators who often have to travel ride it. When I go to work in the countryside, I can take a bus if it's far away, and I can walk if it's nearby."

　　Bureau Chief Chen not only cared for the cadres in his bureau but also cared for the masses. In July of last year, Cixi County's rural areas began harvesting early rice, and a nearby agricultural cooperative lacked labor, so the rice could not be harvested in time. When Bureau Chief Chen learned about this, he immediately took more than 20 cadres to help the agricultural cooperative harvest rice. On August 1, a typhoon suddenly struck, with strong winds and heavy rain day and night. In order to go to the countryside to check on the disaster situation, Bureau Chief Chen returned from a meeting at the county party committee and set off with a few cadres that night. The wind and rain were heavy along the way, and he slipped and fell after only a few sections of road. Bureau Chief Chen ignored these and still rushed to his destination to check on the disaster situation, comfort the masses, and work with the township cadres to mobilize the masses to help themselves through production. The morale of the masses rose with it.

　　Bureau Chief Chen always compares things to the past when dealing with life, work, and other issues. He is a veteran cadre who participated in the Long March and experienced all kinds of difficulties. During the Long March, the troops often had no food to eat, and the leaders slaughtered their own horses and distributed the horse meat to everyone to fill their stomachs. Unforgettable scenes appeared before his eyes. Therefore, although his life is so frugal, he never felt any hardship, but felt that life now is comfortable enough compared to the past.

### 俭朴的陈局长

    俭朴的陈局长	马如宝
    “你是问我们的局长？他呀！局里的人都有这样一个感觉，他还是和过去在部队时一样艰苦朴素。”浙江省慈溪县兵役局的管理员陈增法同志和我谈论着该县兵役局局长陈永弟同志艰苦朴素的模范事迹。
    他对陈局长的生活熟悉极了，局长有几套衣服他都能数清楚，他说：“这些衣服大都是过去实行供给制时公家发给的，有一套制服，颜色已经褪得不像样子了，局长拿去染了一下又重新穿上。”
    陈局长好像不知道疲劳似的，每天早上，陈增法总是起得很早，可是陈局长起得比他还要早。而夜里十一点多钟，陈增法到寝室里去睡觉的时候，陈局长办公室的电灯还亮着呢！？
    陈局长还有一个和别人不同的脾气，冲茶、打水、买饭，样样都自己动手，从来不愿意花费人家一点手脚。一次，陈局长到宁波去开会，背了个包袱到火车站去，被一个通讯员看见了，通讯员要替陈局长背包袱，陈局长要自己背，二人夺了好一阵，后来，陈局长板起了面孔，通讯员没办法只好走了。局里的通讯员都说：碰到像陈局长这样的首长，不知道要少做多少事情。
    在陈局长面前，陈增法也曾经碰到过不愉快的事情：每当局里的财务计划或者某项费用的开支，拿到陈局长那里审批时，总要被顶回来，弄得陈增法很不好意思，这时，陈局长就谆谆告诉他：对于公家的钱，一个也不能宽用，在过去战争的年代里，用一个钱也要经过仔细盘算，快拿回去再核计核计吧！
    这些事，不仅陈增法体会很深，局里其他同志也同样有较深的体会。另一个同志告诉我这样一件事：
    早在1954年陈局长刚调到兵役局来工作的时候，县级各机关正从慈城镇搬到浒山，许多单位都感到住房缺乏，兵役局有三十多个干部，只分到五、六间房子，做办公室都不够，有些人只好睡在走廊上，怎么办呢？陈局长马上出了个主意：附近有六间房子，虽然破破烂烂，但是稍加修理，还可以勉强住住。他就向县财政科建议，并由财政科拨出人民币八百元，作为修理房屋的费用。然后，叫了几个木匠、泥水匠，又动员局里干部参加义务劳动，他自己也和大家一起动手。几天以后，六间破房子终于修好了，作了干部的住屋。陈局长自己拣了小小的一间，既作办公室，又作寝室。他家里的人没有房子住，他就设法将他们散居在外面，一直到去年10月份，局里新盖了办公室，把原来的办公室作了宿舍，陈局长一家人才搬到局里来住。
    也是1954年，领导上为了照顾陈局长的工作和身体，曾发给他一辆自行车，这本来是一件很普通的事，可是陈局长却一直没有骑这辆车子，人家问他为什么不骑车子呀！他说：“领导上对我照顾，我很感激，可是现在大家都没有车子，还是让给经常要出差的通讯员去骑。我下乡工作，路远的可乘汽车，路近的可以走。”
    陈局长不仅爱护自己局里的干部，而且关心群众。去年7月份，慈溪县农村开始收割早稻，附近有一个农业社劳动力不足，稻子不能及时收割。事情被陈局长知道了，就马上带了二十多个干部赶去，帮助农业社割稻。8月1日，忽然刮起了台风，狂风暴雨，昼夜不止，为了下乡检查灾情，陈局长从县委开会回来，当晚就带了几个干部出发了。一路上风大雨急，没走上几段路便滑倒了，陈局长顾不了这些，仍旧一股劲地赶到目的地，检查灾情，慰问群众，并和乡干部一起，发动群众生产自救，群众的情绪随着高涨起来了。
    陈局长在处理生活、工作等等问题时，总是要和过去比一比。他是一个参加长征的老干部，经受过各种各样的困难。长征时，部队常常没有饭吃，首长将自己的马宰掉，把马肉分给大家充饥。一幕幕难忘的景象浮现在他的眼前。因此，他的生活虽然这样俭朴，他不但从来没有感到什么苦，反而觉得比起过去来现在的生活已经够舒服了。
