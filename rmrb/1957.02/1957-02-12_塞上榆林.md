    Yulin on the Frontier
    Qing Ye
    Yulin—this ancient famous city on the frontier is leaping forward.

    Yulin is a transportation hub between the interior and the border regions, and also a distribution center for goods and livestock. Before liberation, the only highway here—the Xian(yang)-Yulin highway—was obstructed by sand and water, and was impassable for a long time; the only means of transportation at that time was camel caravans and animal teams. Now, the Xian-Yulin highway, winding through sand dunes, grasslands, mountains, and barren beaches, is often busy with trucks, and the sound of motors has replaced the tinkling of camel bells. The highways from Yulin to Baotou, Dingbian, and Fugu have connected the mountainous areas and grasslands into one. With the change in the situation of traffic obstruction, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has also become active. Hardworking and honest Mongolian brothers drive herds of cattle, sheep, and horses from the Inner Mongolian grasslands and bring wool to trade here.

    The vanguards of industrial construction—geological exploration team members—have also come to Yulin. These young men and women, who have come from all over the motherland, often carry their bags and instruments in the scorching sun or severe cold, exploring the underground treasures of Yulin. Their footprints have been left on the sand dunes and grasslands.

    The spacious new factory buildings of the Yulin Tannery and the Yulin Woolen Mill have been built in the city. The number of workers has increased more than thirteen times compared to before liberation. Complete sets of new wool spinning, tanning, and power generation equipment have also been transported from all over the motherland. The variety of industrial products has greatly increased. The famous Yulin Camel brand blankets, sweaters, yarn, and wool fabrics are also sold to Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Inner Mongolia, and Gansu. Yulin carpets, which were unsalable before liberation but famous everywhere, are now selling well throughout the country.

    Under the collective management of agricultural producers' cooperatives, shelterbelts have already appeared on the edge of the desert outside Yulin city. Last year, "thousand-jin areas" appeared on the once barren land.

    The urban appearance of Yulin has changed greatly. The number of secondary schools alone has more than doubled compared to the past, the school building area has increased more than six times compared to before liberation, and the Yulin People's Library with tens of thousands of books has been built. Theaters and cinemas are under construction.

    The future of Yulin is even more beautiful. A hydroelectric power station will be built in Hongshi Gorge; the future railway from Xianyang to Baotou will also pass through here... Yulin, which has always been considered "barren and backward, with sandy and thin fields, and inconvenient transportation," will become a new "Jiangnan outside the Great Wall."

    塞上榆林
    青野
    榆林——这座古老的塞上名城，正在飞跃地前进着。
    榆林是内地和塞外的交通咽喉，也是物资、牲畜的集散地。解放以前，这儿仅有的一条公路——咸（阳）榆（林）公路，被沙压水推，长时期没有通车；那时唯一的交通工具是驼帮畜队。如今，蜿蜒在沙丘、草原，山间、荒滩上的咸榆公路，经常奔驰着一辆辆的汽车，马达声代替了叮咚的驼铃声。从榆林到包头、定边、府谷的公路，把山区、草原连成了一片。随着交通闭塞情况的改变，城乡物资交流也活跃起来了。勤劳忠厚的蒙古族弟兄，从内蒙古草原赶上成群的牛羊、马匹，带上毛绒到这儿进行贸易。
    工业建设的尖兵——地质勘探队员也来到了榆林。这些从祖国各地赶来的男女青年，经常在烈日下或严寒里，背着行囊和仪器，勘查着榆林的地下宝藏。沙丘和草原上，都留下了他们的足迹。
    榆林制革厂和榆林毛织厂的一幢幢宽畅的新厂房，在城内建设起来了。工人比解放以前增加了十三倍多。成套的新的纺毛、制革、发电的设备，也从祖国各地运来。工业产品的种类大为增加。有名的榆林骆驼牌毛毯、毛衣、毛线和毛呢等，还远销北京、天津、西安、内蒙古和甘肃等地。解放前滞销而又闻名各地的榆林地毯，现在畅销全国。
    在农业生产合作社的集体经营下，榆林城外沙漠边沿上已经出现了防护林。一向贫瘠的土地上，去年出现了“千斤区”。
    榆林城市面貌已经有很大改变。仅中等学校就比原来增加了一倍，学校建筑面积比解放以前增加了六倍多，一座拥有数万册图书的榆林人民图书馆已经建成，剧院、电影院等正在建设中。
    榆林的远景更加美丽。红石峡将要修建一座水力发电站；未来的咸阳到包头的铁路也要经过这儿……。一向被人认为是“荒凉落后，沙漠薄田，交通不便”的榆林，将要变成新的“塞外江南”。
