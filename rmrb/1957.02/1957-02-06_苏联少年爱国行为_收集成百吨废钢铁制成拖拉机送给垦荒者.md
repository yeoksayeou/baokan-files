    Soviet Children's Patriotic Act
    Collecting Hundreds of Tons of Scrap Steel to Make Tractors for Reclamation Workers
    A group of Young Pioneers came to the management office of the Kharkov Tractor Factory in Ukraine. The children said, "We are collecting scrap steel and plan to use this scrap metal to make steel, make tractors, and send them to the Communist Youth League members who are reclaiming wasteland. Can you manufacture a hundred tractors for us?"
    Collecting scrap metal was initiated by elementary school students in Kharkov. The news quickly spread throughout Ukraine. Children from all corners of the republic participated in the work of collecting scrap iron. In this way, hundreds of tons of scrap steel were quickly collected.
    The Kharkov Tractor Factory completed the elementary school students' order before the New Year of 1957. The factory used these materials to make one hundred and thirty tractors. Each tractor was inscribed with: "To the young Communist League members reclaiming wasteland – From the Ukrainian Young Pioneers, December 1956".
    On the eve of the New Year of 1957, a train carrying tractors set off for the Kazakh Republic. The Young Pioneers selected a delegation to accompany the train to the city of Kustanai in the Kazakh Republic, to personally hand over the tractors to the young people who were reclaiming wasteland.
    The Communist Youth League members and Young Pioneers of Kustanai warmly and joyfully welcomed the precious gifts and small guests from Ukraine. The Ukrainian Young Pioneer delegation stayed in Kazakhstan for three days, visited the "Shcherbakov" state farm on the wasteland, and held a ceremony on the farm to present the tractors to the reclamation workers. The young guests also met with the Young Pioneers of the city at the Kustanai Regional Theater and received the "For the Development of Virgin Lands" commemorative medal from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.
    The Kustanai Regional Committee of the Communist Youth League of Kazakhstan issued certificates of honor to the Kharkov City Young Pioneer Organization, the Kharkov Tractor Factory, and the editorial department of the Ukrainian children's newspaper that actively supported the patriotic initiative of the elementary school students.

    苏联少年爱国行为
    收集成百吨废钢铁制成拖拉机送给垦荒者
    一群少先队员来到乌克兰哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂的管理处。孩子们说：“我们正在收集废钢铁，打算用这些废金属炼成钢铁，制成拖拉机，送给开垦荒地的共青团员。请你们给制造一百架拖拉机好吗？”
    收集废金属是哈尔科夫市的小学生发起的。这个消息立刻传遍了整个乌克兰。共和国各个角落的孩子们都参加了收集废铁的工作。这样，很快就集起了成百吨的废钢铁。
    哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂在1957年新年以前完成了小学生们的订货。工厂用这些材料制成了一百三十台拖拉机。每一台拖拉机上都写着：“给开荒的青年团员们——乌克兰少先队员赠，1956年12月”。
    1957年新年的前夕，载着拖拉机的列车向哈萨克共和国出发了。少先队员们选出了一个代表团，随列车到哈萨克共和国的库斯坦奈市，去亲手把拖拉机交给开荒的青年人。
    库斯坦奈的共青团员和少先队员们热情而愉快地欢迎了来自乌克兰的珍贵礼物和小客人们。乌克兰少先队的这个代表团在哈萨克斯坦停了三天，参观了荒地上的“谢尔巴科夫”国营农场，并在农场里举行了把拖拉机赠给开荒者的仪式。小客人们还在库斯坦奈州剧院同这个城市的少先队员见了面，并获得了共青团中央的“为了开垦新地”的纪念章。
    哈萨克斯坦共青团库斯坦奈州委员会把荣誉证书发给哈尔科夫市少先队组织、哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂，以及积极支持小学生的爱国倡议的乌克兰儿童报纸的编辑部。　（君）
