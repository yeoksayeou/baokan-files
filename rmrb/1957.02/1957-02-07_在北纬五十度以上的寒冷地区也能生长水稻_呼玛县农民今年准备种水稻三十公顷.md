Xinhua News Agency, Heihe, 6th. The Huma County Demonstration Farm in Heilongjiang Province, located between 52 and 53 degrees north latitude, has successfully grown rice after four years of effort. The notion that rice cannot be grown in cold regions above 50 degrees north latitude has thus been broken. This year, farmers in Huma County are drawing on the experience of the Demonstration Farm and preparing to plant 30 hectares of rice. They have already basically completed the water conservancy projects.

Huma County belongs to the Heihe Special District. This special district is located around 50 degrees north latitude and has a cold climate. Only in the last decade or two have people started to grow rice. Initially, only a few Korean farmers grew rice. In recent years, the development of the agricultural cooperation movement has gradually changed the farmers' past individual management situation, where they lacked the ability to build water conservancy projects and lacked rice production technology. In particular, since the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives last year, rice cultivation has greatly developed. Last year, the special district had 2,077 hectares of rice paddies, an increase of 42.7% compared to 1955. This year, the special district plans to expand the rice planting area to 4,000 hectares. More than 80% of the water conservancy projects for expanding rice paddies have now been completed, and relevant departments have also trained 192 water conservancy technicians.

The Heihe Special District is actually very suitable for developing rice production. There are more than 30 rivers, large and small, and large areas of flat wasteland that can be utilized. The quality of the rice here is very good; people from the interior say it is no worse than Xiaozhan rice from Tianjin. Although the current yield per hectare is only four to five thousand jin, individual cases have recorded over ten thousand jin; therefore, increasing the yield per unit area is possible.

### 在北纬五十度以上的寒冷地区也能生长水稻  呼玛县农民今年准备种水稻三十公顷

    在北纬五十度以上的寒冷地区也能生长水稻
    呼玛县农民今年准备种水稻三十公顷
    新华社黑河6日电　位于北纬五十二度到五十三度之间的黑龙江省呼玛县示范农场，经过四年的努力，播种水稻获得成功。北纬五十度以上的寒冷地区不能种水稻的说法，从此就被打破了。今年呼玛县农民吸取示范农场的经验，准备播种三十公顷水稻。目前他们已经把水利工程基本上兴修好了。
    呼玛县属于黑河专区。这个专区处在北纬五十度上下，气候寒冷，最近一二十年才有人种植水稻。起初，种植水稻的只是个别朝鲜族农民。近几年来，农业合作化运动的开展，逐步改变了农民过去个体经营无力兴修水利工程和缺乏水稻生产技术的状况。特别是去年办起高级农业社以后，水稻的栽培工作才大大发展。去年全专区水稻田达到二千零七十七公顷，比1955年增加42.7％。今年这个专区计划把水稻播种面积扩大到四千公顷。现在扩大稻田的水利工程已经完成80％以上，有关部门还培养了水利技术员一百九十二名。
    黑河专区其实很适宜于发展水稻，境内有大小三十多条河流和大块的平坦荒地可以利用。这里的稻米质量很好，从内地来的人都说不次于天津的小站米。虽然目前每公顷的产量只有四五千斤，但是个别的也有过一万斤的纪录；因此，提高单位面积产量是可能的。
