Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th: The Harbin Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry will newly build and reconstruct fourteen pairs of inclined shafts this year. These shafts will be put into production successively in the second half of the year, and can produce more than 500,000 tons of coal by the end of the year. When these fourteen pairs of inclined shafts reach their designed output, they can produce 2.19 million tons of coal annually. These inclined shafts are distributed in Jixi, Hegang, Tonghua, Jiaohe, Liaoyuan, Zhalainuoer and other mining areas.

Constructing inclined coal mine shafts is an effective method to rapidly increase coal production. Because the degree of mechanization of inclined shafts is relatively low and the underground engineering is not very large, the investment is small and the construction time is short. The construction time of the inclined shafts put into production by the Harbin Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry this year is generally about twenty-four months.

In order to ensure that these inclined shafts can be completed and put into production on schedule or ahead of schedule, the Harbin Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry has taken active measures. For example, the Hegang Dalu No. 2 inclined shaft was originally planned to use hydraulic sand filling for coal mining and electric locomotives for coal transportation, but these equipment cannot be resolved this year. It is now decided to adopt layered coal mining and non-polar rope coal transportation measures. Therefore, this pair of inclined shafts can be put into production in the second quarter.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Chongqing Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry will continue to newly build and reconstruct thirteen pairs of mines in Sichuan Province this year.

According to the arrangements of the basic construction plan balance meeting of the Chongqing Administration Bureau, the Xiaochong No. 1 well in the Yongchuan-Rongchang mining area, which is under construction, can produce coal this year. The newly built Zhongliangshan South Mine and the first modern vertical shaft in the southwest, the Yutianpu vertical shaft in the Nantong mining area, will also be put into production successively during the second five-year plan period.

The coal mine industry in the Chongqing area originally had a very weak foundation. Although the output of mines under the Chongqing Administration Bureau increased by an average of 22.7% per year from 1952 to 1956, it still cannot meet the ever-increasing industrial coal needs of this area. Since the second half of 1956, a new situation of tight coal supply has emerged. This year, Chongqing is launching a large-scale mine construction to ease the tight coal supply situation.

### 迅速增产煤炭　适应社会需要  黑龙江四川新建改建许多矿井

    迅速增产煤炭　适应社会需要
    黑龙江四川新建改建许多矿井
    据新华社哈尔滨10日电　煤炭工业部哈尔滨管理局今年将新建和改建成十四对斜井。下半年这些井就要陆续投入生产，到年底可以产煤五十万吨以上。这十四对斜井达到设计产量的时候，每年可以产煤二百一十九万吨。这些斜井分布在鸡西、鹤岗、通化、蛟河、辽源、扎赉诺尔等矿区。
    建设煤矿斜井是迅速增产煤炭的有效方法。由于斜井的机械化程度较低，地下工程不很大，所以，投资少、建设时间短。煤炭工业部哈尔滨管理局今年投入生产的斜井，建设时间一般都在二十四个月左右。
    为使这些斜井能够如期或提前建成投入生产，煤炭工业部哈尔滨管理局采取了积极措施。如鹤岗大陆二斜井，原计划使用水砂充填采煤和电机车运煤，这些设备今年都不能解决。现在决定采取分层采煤和用无极绳运煤的措施。因此这对斜井在第二季度就可以投入生产。
    据新华社讯　煤炭工业部重庆管理局今年将在四川省境内继续新建和改建十三对矿井。
    根据重庆管理局基本建设计划平衡会议的安排，正在建设的永（川）荣（昌）矿区的小冲一号井，今年可以出煤。新建中梁山南矿井和西南第一个现代化竖井——南桐矿区鱼田堡竖井在第二个五年计划期间也将陆续投入生产。
    重庆地区煤矿工业原来基础很薄弱。虽然在1952年到1956年中重庆管理局所属各矿的产量平均每年增加22.7％，还是不能满足这个地区日益增长的工业用煤需要，从1956年下半年起便出现了煤炭供应紧张的新情况。今年重庆地区展开较大规模的矿井建设，就是为了缓和煤炭供应的紧张局面。
