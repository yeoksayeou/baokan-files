Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 10th. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently convened afforestation work conferences in Jiangling and Huanggang respectively, attended by representatives from twenty counties along the Yangtze River. The committee called on youth in various localities to seize the afforestation season and make early preparations to realize the initiative of greening the banks of the Yangtze River.

Last year, 350,000 young people and children in Hubei Province participated in the greening of the Yangtze River banks. They planted a total of 5.4 million trees on the banks of the river, stretching over 1,600 kilometers, with an average survival rate of about 50%. However, due to a lack of leadership experience in the past, insufficient preparation, small seedlings, failure to seize the season, and a lack of technical guidance and poor management, the survival rate of seedlings in many areas was not high.

After summarizing the experiences and lessons of the past year, the conference believed that in addition to making preparations earlier this year, paying attention to seedling specifications, imparting good techniques, and doing a good job in forest protection and cultivation, youth league organizations at all levels should further publicize the great significance of greening the banks of rivers and mountains and organizing young people to learn afforestation techniques. Youth afforestation shock brigades should be organized, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the shock role of youth should be brought into full play.

    青年团湖北省委号召青年
    实现绿化长江两岸的倡议
    新华社武汉10日电　青年团湖北省委员会最近分别在江陵、黄岗两地召开长江沿岸二十个县的造林工作会议，号召各地青年抓住造林季节及早作好准备，实现绿化长江两岸的倡议。
    去年湖北省有三十五万青、少年参加了绿化长江两岸的活动，在沿江长达一千六百多公里的堤岸上，共植树五百四十万株，成活率一般都在50％左右。但是，由于过去领导缺乏经验，准备工作做得不够，树苗小，未抓住季节，加上缺乏技术指导和管理不善，结果有不少地区的树苗成活率不高。
    在总结了去年的经验教训后，会议认为今年除要早些做好准备工作，注意树苗规格，传授好技术和作好护林、育林的工作以外，各级青年团组织还应该进一步深入地宣传绿化江河两岸、绿化荒山的重大意义，并且要组织青少年学习造林技术，组织青年造林突击队，在党委统一领导下，充分发挥青年的突击作用。
