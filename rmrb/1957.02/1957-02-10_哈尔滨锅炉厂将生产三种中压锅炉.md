Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, February 9th. The newly built Harbin Boiler Factory will trial-produce and manufacture the first batch of power station boilers this year. These boilers are three types of medium-pressure boilers with steam evaporation capacities of 35 tons, 75 tons, and 130 tons per hour. Among them, the 35-ton boiler has already been successfully trial-produced in December last year. These boilers are being manufactured for new and expanded power stations and power plants in Zhuzhou, Guiyang, Jiamusi, Liaoyuan, Kaiyuan, Jinxi, and Anshan.

The Harbin Boiler Factory was basically completed at the end of last year. At present, the factory's design and process engineering technicians are separately carrying out various trial production preparation tasks. In the workshops, workers are trial-producing a medium-pressure boiler with a steam evaporation capacity of 75 tons per hour. This boiler is planned to be successfully trial-produced in April.

This year, in addition to trial-producing and manufacturing the above-mentioned three types of medium-pressure boilers, the engineering technicians at the Harbin Boiler Factory are also conducting technical preparations for trial-producing two types of high-pressure boilers with capacities of 120 tons and 230 tons.

Manufacturing boilers requires a large amount of steel. The factory's engineering technicians are actively studying measures to save steel.

    哈尔滨锅炉厂将生产三种中压锅炉
    新华社哈尔滨9日电　新建的哈尔滨锅炉厂今年将试制和生产第一批发电站用的锅炉；这些锅炉是每小时蒸汽蒸发量三十五吨、七十五吨和一百三十吨的三种中压锅炉。其中，三十五吨锅炉已经在去年12月份试制成功。这些锅炉是为株州、贵阳、佳木斯、辽源、开远、锦西和鞍山等地新建和扩建的电站和发电厂制造的。
    哈尔滨锅炉厂在去年年底基本上建成。目前，这个厂的设计和工艺工程技术人员都在分头进行各项试制准备工作。在车间里，工人们正在试制一台每小时蒸汽蒸发量七十五吨的中压锅炉。这台锅炉计划在4月份试制成功。
    今年，哈尔滨锅炉厂除了试制和生产上述三种中压锅炉以外，工程技术人员们还在为试制一百二十吨和二百三十吨的两种高压锅炉进行技术准备工作。
    制造锅炉需要大量钢材。这个厂的工程技术人员正在积极研究节省钢材的措施。
