At the Tianjin Locomotive Depot, there are two call personnel, one named An Xianzeng and the other Wang Shuguang. They have the same job, the same salary, and roughly the same number of family members. However, one manages his household diligently, is mentally happy, and actively studies his work; the other's life is poorly arranged, and he is always frowning and complaining about not having enough money.

An Xianzeng's family has five members: his wife, three children, and himself. His monthly salary is 47.50 yuan, which, calculated per capita, is 15 yuan less than the minimum living standard determined by the trade union. However, he and his wife manage their household very well and have not received subsidies from the trade union for a year and two months. Every time he receives his salary, he and his wife carefully calculate their various expenditures: first, they pay a little over one yuan for rent and utilities, spend more than 20 yuan on food, oil, salt, and sauce, set aside 10 yuan for An Xianzeng's lunch and pocket money, and reserve 2 yuan for the eldest child, who is in middle school, for tuition. The remaining 10-odd yuan is used for the entire month's vegetable money, coal, and daily necessities. In this way, they can still save a few yuan each month. Sometimes, when An Xianzeng receives a bonus, he also deposits it in the bank. An Xianzeng's wife is even more frugal. Every month, in addition to buying 30 to 40 jin of white flour for her husband and children, she usually eats corn flour and brown rice herself. When there are plenty of green vegetables on the market in the autumn, she buys more to pickle into salted vegetables, which last all winter. Although she added a new cotton quilt and replaced the linings and sheets of two cotton quilts at the end of last year, and added new clothes for the children, she still has more than 80 yuan in the bank.

With good household management, An Xianzeng is also focused on his work. Originally, each locomotive and crew in the depot work according to the schedule. However, there are often changes, which require call personnel to notify them. An Xianzeng usually carefully remembers the address of each crew member. When a train schedule changes, he can quickly find them. Once, a train going to Shanhaiguan was about to depart when it was discovered that the driver had taken sick leave, and driver Luo Youchang needed to fill in. Upon receiving the notice, An Xianzeng immediately rode his bicycle to find Luo Youchang. In order not to delay the departure, he handed the bicycle to Luo Youchang and walked for more than two hours before returning to the depot. Last summer, a train departing from Tianjin Station to Dezhou at 1:50 a.m. was delayed due to a blockage on the line, and the original locomotive could not return to the depot on time, so another locomotive was temporarily dispatched. However, the addresses of the three crew members of this locomotive were very scattered, all about ten miles apart. He thought that if he found them one by one and brought them to the depot before going to Tianjin Station, there would not be enough time. So, he first went to Xiaoshulin to find the driver, then to Dazhigu to find the co-driver, and asked them to report for duty at Tianjin Station; then he went to Xigu to find the fireman and asked him to report for duty at the nearby West Station, using the more than 20 minutes it took for the train to travel from Tianjin Station to Tianjin West Station to ensure that all three people made it on time. Because he actively overcame difficulties, he received a bonus in the third quarter of last year and was selected as an advanced producer in the fourth quarter.

Wang Shuguang's family has a heavier economic burden with four children. However, Wang Shuguang and his wife came from families of handicraft owners and the bourgeoisie, and have developed habits of living luxuriously and flaunting their wealth. The four children's daily pocket money alone costs more than two jiao, enough for a frugal family's daily vegetable money. Wang Shuguang also likes to drink, and often buys a few liang of "Erguotou" after work, and buys a goose wing or a few liang of braised meat to eat. In the past, the trade union subsidized him more than 20 yuan every month, but he still pawned his cotton clothes and quilts and owed dozens of yuan in debt. Last year, the trade union redeemed his pawned items, paid off his debts, and provided cotton clothing in the winter. At the same time, it organized Wang Shuguang's wife to wash work clothes for the crew members. However, the living expenses are still not enough, and even last year's trade union membership dues have not been paid in full. Wang Shuguang's household management is poor, and he is not at ease at work, often asking relatives and the trade union for help.

When the reporter recently visited these two families, An Xianzeng was discussing with his wife how to save more money to buy government bonds. An Xianzeng said, "In the past, our family's life was also unplanned, and we were in deficit every month. Later, I understood the principle that the country is under construction and needs a lot of funds, so I discussed with my wife that we must manage our family life well and no longer rely on public subsidies." When Wang Shuguang's wife saw the reporter, she began to complain that she had recently incurred more than 30 yuan in debt. Two days ago, there was no rice to eat at home, and thanks to his sister giving him five yuan, he was able to survive until the next payday.

    收入相等支出不同的结果
    新华社记者　孟帆
    天津机务段有两个叫班员，一个叫安宪增，一个叫王树光。他两工作相同、工资相同，家庭人口也差不多。可是一个勤俭治家，精神愉快，积极钻研工作；一个生活安排不当、整天愁眉苦脸，叫嚷没钱花。
    安宪增家里有五口人：妻子、三个孩子和他自己。他每月的工资是四十七元五角，按全家人口计算比工会确定的最低生活标准还少十五元。但是，他同妻子把家庭安排得很好，已经有一年零两个月没有去工会领补助金了。每次领到工资，他就同妻子仔细地计算着各项支出：先交一元多钱的房租、水电费，花二十多元买粮食和油盐酱醋，拿出十元做为安宪增吃午饭和零用，再留出两元给在中学念书的大孩子做学费，剩下的十多元就做为全月的菜钱、买煤和日用品。就这样，他们每月还能节省出几块钱储蓄起来。有时安宪增得了奖金，也存入银行里。安宪增的妻子更会过日子，每月除了为丈夫、孩子买三、四十斤白面以外，自己日常总是吃玉米面和糙米。当秋天青菜大量上市的时候，就多买一些腌成咸菜，一冬吃不尽。虽然去年年底新添了一床棉被，换了两床棉被的被里和床单，还给孩子们添了新衣服，现在在银行里还有八十多元的存款。
    家庭生活安排得好，安宪增在工作起来也专心。本来，段内的每台机车和乘务人员都是按调度计划表工作。可是常常有变动，就需要叫班员去通知他们。安宪增平时就细心地记牢每个乘务员的住址，当车次变动的时候，能很快地找到他们。有一次，往山海关去的列车快开了，才发现司机请了病假，需要找司机长罗有昌替班。安宪增接到通知，马上骑自行车找到罗有昌，为了不误点，他把自行车交给罗有昌，自己步行了两个多小时才回到段里。去年夏天，一次夜里一点五十分由天津站向德州发车，由于线路堵塞，原定的机车不能按时回段，临时调换了另一台机车。但是，这台机车的三个乘务员的住址非常分散，都相距有十来里路。他想，如果把他们一个一个地找到段里再到天津站，时间来不及。于是，他先到小树林找到司机，又到大直沽找到副司机，叫他们两人到天津站接班；然后到西沽找司炉，叫他到附近的西站接班，利用列车由天津站开到天津西站需要二十多分钟的时间，使三个人全赶上了班次。由于他积极克服困难，去年第三季得了奖金，第四季被评选为先进生产者。
    王树光的家庭经济负担重些，有四个孩子。但是王树光和他的妻子，是手工业主和资产阶级家庭出身，养成了生活考究、讲排场的习气。四个孩子每天只零花钱就要两角多，足够一个俭朴家庭一天的菜钱。王树光还爱喝酒，时常下班后打上几两“二锅头”，买个大雁翅膀或几两酱肉吃。过去工会每月都补助他二十多元，可是还把棉衣、棉被当了，并且欠了几十元的债。去年，工会把他典当的东西给赎出来，还了债，冬天又救济了棉衣服，同时组织王树光的妻子为乘务员洗工作服。但是生活费用仍然不够，连去年的工会会费也没有交齐。王树光家庭生活安排不好，工作也不安心，经常找亲戚、工会要求照顾。
    记者最近到这两个家庭访问的时候，安宪增正同妻子商量着怎样再节省一些钱买公债。安宪增说：“过去家里生活也没有计划，月月亏空。后来，我明白了国家正在建设需要大量资金的道理，就同妻子商量一定要把家庭生活安排好，不再依靠公家补助。”王树光的妻子见了记者就诉起苦来，最近又欠了三十多元的债。两天前，家里没有米吃，亏得他姐姐给了五元才可以维持到下次领薪的日子。
