    A Statistics Table of Reduced Cases
    Recently, when we visited the Jinan Intermediate People's Court in the Jinan area, we saw a statistics table of cases. The colored lines on the statistics table indicated that the criminal cases accepted by the thirty counties in the Jinan area in the first eleven months of last year decreased by 48% compared with the same period of the previous year; at the same time, the 13,456 civil cases accepted also decreased by one-third compared with 1955. Land dispute cases, which used to occur most frequently in rural areas, no longer exist after agricultural cooperation. During the summer wheat harvest season last year, only five fire incidents occurred, only one of which was destructive, a decrease of more than 86% compared with the same period of the previous year.
    Wu Zhihui, the president of the Intermediate People's Court, said: Before liberation, the western mountainous areas of Jinan Prefecture harbored many bandits, and robbery and theft were rampant in the society. Some people described the theft cases accepted by the old yamen as measuring sesame seeds by the bucket. After liberation, under the strict supervision of the broad masses and the government's lenient policy, some of the past criminals surrendered themselves. Now there is a new order in the countryside.
    The Lost and Found Registration Book of the Cultural Center
    A thick lost and found registration book hangs on the wall of the Linfen County Cultural Center. A passing cadre found his lost document briefcase from the registration book - this was a lost and found incident in the first half of January.
    Last summer, Shang Heizhi, a worker driving a rubber-wheeled cart from Henan Province, lost his livestock more than twenty miles away from Linfen City. He searched for half a day and night without any trace. Shang Heizhi was so anxious that he cried. At that time, someone reminded him to go to the Cultural Center in the city for help. Before dawn the next day, he rushed into the city and knocked on the door of the Cultural Center. Unexpectedly, the livestock that had been lost for half a day and night was chewing fodder in the corridor. When he learned that the livestock had run to the city gate and was intercepted by a pedestrian and taken to the Cultural Center, and that the Cultural Center staff had fed it fodder for fear of starvation, he was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes and he could not even speak.
    Since the Linfen County Cultural Center established the lost and found registration book in 1954, the masses have voluntarily sent more than 400 lost items to the Cultural Center. The staff of the Cultural Center has used this registration book and the blackboard bulletin board to help more than 300 losers find their lost items. After a considerable number of farmers, students, and cadres who picked up things and did not pocket them were announced by the Cultural Center, they were praised by the broad masses and thanked by the losers. Many losers and finders have become good friends through the introduction of the Cultural Center.
      Granny Zhang Eats from a Small Pot
    The peasants in Sunjia Yuan Village, Xiangfen County, all praise the happy old age of Zhang Yuemei. Elderly Granny Zhang spent all her energy in taking care of household affairs and raising children in her youth. Now she enjoys the care and attention of her children. After entering winter, her sons and daughters-in-law, fearing that she would suffer from the cold, placed Granny Zhang in the sunniest and warmest room, and specially made a charcoal fire, with a piece of dog skin mattress on the kang. Her sons and daughters-in-law constantly sent pocket money to Granny Zhang. Last year, they even "mobilized" her to watch plays in the city gate twenty times, and watch mobile movie screenings in the village four times.
    The three daughters-in-law at home sometimes make a small pot of food for their mother-in-law. When the old lady sees her filial daughters-in-law and a group of grandchildren, she can't bear to eat alone.
    In 1956, the agricultural cooperative in this village achieved a bumper harvest, and Granny Zhang's family earned an average of 140 yuan per person. The daughters-in-law decided to give the old lady a small pot of food. Granny Zhang repeatedly refused because she thought it was a waste of food and trouble, but she could not resist everyone's opinion.
      Brothers Yield to Each Other to Be the Head of the Household
    One evening before New Year's Day, Ding Xingbang, an old man with gray hair, came to the office of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in Linfen County. He asked the cooperative to change the name of his household head to his fourth younger brother. This immediately caused surprise: Maybe the brothers had quarreled.
    This old man is sixty-eight years old. When he was sixteen years old, he came here from Hebei with his parents and brothers to escape the famine. After more than fifty years of hard work, their family has become a large family of nineteen people. He followed his father's will to bring up his younger brothers. The three younger brothers and sisters-in-law treated him and his wife with respect like elders.
    After he participated in the cooperative's democratic meeting at the end of last year, he thought: Family affairs should also be democratic and united, and let his younger brother manage it well. When the whole family discussed this issue in the evening, no one agreed. He said that the second brother was capable in labor, and the fourth brother was young and knew more new principles, so it was best to manage the family affairs. The fourth brother immediately blushed and refused to accept. The sisters-in-law, understanding Ding Xingbang's meaning, persuaded the fourth brother to accept the task. After pushing back and forth, the fourth brother accepted, but still let Ding Xingbang manage the finances.
    This matter spread throughout the village. Some people suggested that "if there is an elder brother, the younger brother should not be prominent," which violated the old family rules of many years. After hearing this, Ding Xingbang replied: That was the old society, now it is the new society!

    一张案件减少的统计表
    最近，我们到晋南地区中级人民法院采访的时候，看到了一张案件情况的统计表。统计表上的彩色线条标明晋南专区三十个县在去年头十一个月中，受理的刑事案件比前年同期减少了48％；同时受理的一万三千四百五十六件民事案件，也比1955年减少了三分之一。农村中过去发生最多的土地纠纷案件在农业合作化以后已经不存在了。去年夏季麦收期间只发生失火事件五起，其中属于破坏性的只有一起，这比前年同期减少了86％多。
    中级人民法院院长武志慧说：晋南专区的西山地区解放以前潜藏着不少盗匪，社会上抢劫、偷盗成风，有人形容旧衙门里受理的偷盗案件是用斗量芝麻。解放后，在广大群众严密监督和政府宽大政策的感召下，有一部分过去的罪犯投案自首了。现在农村中有了新的秩序。
    文化馆的拾物登记簿
    临汾县文化馆的墙壁上悬挂着一本厚厚的拾物登记簿。一个过路干部从登记簿上找见了他遗失的文件皮包——这是1月上半月的一次拾物事件。
    去年夏天，河南省赶胶皮车工人商黑只在距临汾城二十多里的地方惊失牲口，找觅了半天半夜没有下落，商黑只坐卧不安地急得直哭，当时有人提醒他进城请文化馆帮助寻找。第二天天还未明他赶进城敲开文化馆的大门，没想到丢失了半天一夜的牲口正在走廊里嚼着草料。当他知道牲口奔跑到城关被行人截住牵送到文化馆，文化馆人员怕牲口挨饿给它上了草料后，激动得眼泪夺眶而出，连话也说不出来。
    临汾县文化馆从1954年建立拾物登记簿后，到现在已经有四百多次群众自动把拾到的失物送到文化馆来。文化馆的工作人员利用这个登记簿和黑板报招领服务栏已帮助三百多个失主找到了失物。有相当一批拾物不昧的农民、学生和干部经过文化馆公布后，受到广大群众的赞扬和失主的感谢。不少失主和拾者通过文化馆的介绍结交成好朋友。
      张大娘吃上小锅饭
    襄汾县孙家院村的农民，都赞扬张月梅老大娘的晚年幸福生活。年迈的张大娘在青壮年时代把全部精力花费在料理家务和抚育子女上，现在她享受到了孩子们的关怀和照顾。入冬后，儿子和媳妇们怕她受冷受冻，把张大娘安置到阳光充沛、最暖和的房间里，还特意生了个炭火，炕上铺了块狗皮褥子。儿子媳妇不断地把零花钱送到张大娘的手里，去年一年还“动员”她去城关看了二十次戏，在本村看了四次巡回放映的电影。
    在家的三个媳妇有时给婆婆另做些小锅饭。大娘看到孝顺的儿媳、成群的孙子，便不忍心自己一个人吃。
    1956年这个村的农业社获得丰产，张大娘家每人平均收入一百四十元。儿媳们决定给老人吃小锅饭，张大娘嫌费粮费事再三不愿，但是也拗不过大家的意见。
      兄弟谦让当家长
    元旦前夕的一个晚上，临汾县红星农业社办公室来了一位鬓发斑百的老人丁兴邦。他要求社里把他的户主名更换成他的四弟。这件事马上引起人们诧异：大概是兄弟吵了架。
    这位老人六十八岁了，十六岁的时候随着父母弟弟从河北逃荒来到这里，经过五十多年的辛勤劳动，现在他们家庭已经成了一个十九口人的大家庭了。他遵循着父亲遗嘱把弟弟培养成人。三个弟弟和弟媳妇就像尊敬老人似地对待着他和他的妻子。
    去年年底他参加了社里的民主大会后想着：家务事也要民主团结，让给弟弟管理好。晚上全家人讨论这个问题的时候，没有一个人同意。他说论劳动老二能行，四弟年青新道理懂得多，管理家务最好。四弟马上急红了脸不愿接受。妯娌们懂得丁兴邦的意思后，都劝说四弟接受这个任务。推来推去四弟接受了，只是财务还让丁兴邦经管。
    这事情传遍全村，有人提出“有兄不显弟”，这是破坏了多年的老家规。丁兴邦听到后就回答说：那是旧社会，现在是新社会啊！
