Xinhua News Agency, 30th — A fully mechanized, year-round operating forest industrial enterprise is under construction on the upper reaches of the Tangwang River in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area. This area is the richest in timber resources in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, with abundant growth of valuable tree species such as Korean pine, Scotch pine, and Manchurian ash, yielding a high volume of timber.

　　This enterprise is designed according to advanced Soviet logging enterprises. Once completed, it will employ chainsaws for felling, chainsaws for bucking, winches and tractors for skidding, forest trains for transporting timber, and loading machines for loading, unloading, and stacking timber. The log yard will be equipped with an electrified bucking platform. After the raw logs, tens of meters long, are cut into various specifications, they will be sent to the loading area via conveyor belts. The heavy manual labor of forest workers will be replaced by a series of machines.

　　This enterprise is scheduled to go into production in July 1957. The maximum annual timber output will reach 400,000 cubic meters. Such a large enterprise will only require 700 workers, while manual production would require approximately 2,000 people.

　　The workers here will live in concentrated residential areas within the forest area. Workers will take the forest train to work in the morning, the lunch car will deliver lunch to the logging site at noon, and in the evening, they will take the forest train back home to reunite with their families or participate in recreational activities at the club.

　　Currently, in this area of virgin forest, rows of red, white, and beige buildings have already been constructed.

    汤旺河畔新建设
    新华社30日讯　在小兴安岭林区汤旺河上游，正在兴建一座全部机械化常年生产的森林工业企业。这里是小兴安岭林区木材资源最富饶的地带，生长着大量的红松、黄花松、水曲柳等珍贵树种，出材量很高。
    这个企业是按照苏联先进的采伐企业设计的。建成以后将采用电锯采伐，电锯造材，绞盘机、拖拉机集材，森林火车运材，装车机装卸堆集木材。贮木场设有电气化造材台，几十公尺长的原条木被截成各种规格的木材以后，将用传送带送进装车场。林区工人那种笨重的体力劳动，被一系列的机器所代替。
    这个企业将于1957年7月投入生产。木材最高年产量将达四十万立方公尺。像这样一个大企业，只需要七百名工人，假如用手工业生产大约需要两千人。
    这里的工人将集中居住在林区的居民区。工人早上坐森林火车上工，中午餐车把午餐送到伐木场，晚上坐森林火车回到家里和家人团聚或到俱乐部里参加文娱活动。
    目前在这一片原始森林的地带，已建筑了一幢一幢红色、白色、米黄色的房屋。
