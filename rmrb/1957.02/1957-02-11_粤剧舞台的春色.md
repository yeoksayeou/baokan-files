Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 10th: Cantonese opera, known as the "Red Bean of the South," appears particularly colorful in this season of blooming flowers. During the Spring Festival, ten Cantonese opera troupes in Guangzhou simultaneously performed ten different plays, making the cultural life of the people of Guangzhou this Spring Festival richer and more colorful than in previous years.

The Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe performed "Bitter Phoenix Sings of Pity" at the People's Theater. This was a signature play of Ma Shizeng thirty years ago. In this play, he created a vivid image of Yu Xiayun, a kind, upright, and righteous beggar from the lower classes of the old society. This performance was still loved by the audience. In order to more prominently express Yu Xiayun's uprightness and humor, kindness and wit, poverty and lack of petty greed, Ma Shizeng put a lot of effort into the lyrics and singing. Hong Xiannv has been performing this play since 1942, and she has played different roles in the play. This time she played "Cui Yingniang".

The "Wu Zetian" performed by the Guangzhou Cantonese Opera Troupe is a recently adapted historical drama.

The Guangzhou Cantonese Opera Troupe also performed the classical masterpiece "The Peach Blossom Fan" by the famous Qing Dynasty playwright Kong Shangren.

The Rising Sun Cantonese Opera Troupe performed "The Peony Pavilion" during the Spring Festival.
