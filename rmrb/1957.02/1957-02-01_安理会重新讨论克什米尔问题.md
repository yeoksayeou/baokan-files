    Xinhua News Agency, New York, January 31st: The United Nations Security Council reconvened on the 30th to discuss the Kashmir issue. The Council last discussed this issue on January 24th, when it passed a resolution advocating a plebiscite under United Nations supervision to determine the accession of Kashmir.
    At the meeting on the 30th, Pakistani Foreign Minister Noon spoke first, accusing India of failing to fulfill its international obligations regarding Kashmir and of "ignoring" the Security Council's resolution passed on January 24th. In his lengthy speech, Noon also criticized the arguments put forward by the Indian representative at the previous Council meeting.
    Noon concluded by urging the Security Council to "break the deadlock on the Kashmir issue." He reiterated his suggestion of the following "practical measures" to resolve the issue: the entry of United Nations forces into Kashmir, the demand for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kashmir, the disbandment of local militias on both sides of the ceasefire line, and the holding of a plebiscite under United Nations supervision.
    Indian representative Menon then spoke, resolutely refuting the Pakistani representative's claims and stating that he was prepared to provide a more detailed response to these issues at a later date.
    The date of the next Security Council meeting will be determined by the Council President in consultation with other members of the Council.

    安理会重新讨论克什米尔问题
    新华社31日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会30日重新举行会议，讨论克什米尔问题。理事会上次讨论这个问题是在1月24日，当时通过了一个决议，主张在联合国监督下举行公民投票来决定克什米尔的归并问题。
    在30日会议上，巴基斯坦外交部长努恩首先发言，指责印度没有履行对克什米尔的国际义务以及“无视”安全理事会1月24日通过的决议。努恩在他的长篇发言中还批评了印度代表在上次理事会会议上提出的论点。
    努恩最后要求安全理事会“打开克什米尔问题的僵局”。他再次建议用下列“实际措施”来解决这个问题：联合国部队进入克什米尔，要求一切外国军队撤出克什米尔，解散停战线两边的地方民兵，在联合国监督下举行公民投票。
    印度代表梅农接着发言，坚决驳斥了巴基斯坦代表的说法，并且声明准备过些时候对这些问题作更详细的答复。
    安全理事会下次会议的日期将由理事会主席同其他理事国协商决定。
