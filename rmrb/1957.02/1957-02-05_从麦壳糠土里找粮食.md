    Finding Grain from Wheat Husks and Bran

    According to Xinhua News Agency, in the public-private joint venture Fuxing Flour Mill in Tianjin, the scrap material group of the milling workshop, led by Wang Enxiang and six other veteran workers, meticulously sifted and picked through the milling byproducts—wheat husks and bran—last year. They extracted over 140,000 jin of small, half-empty wheat grains, which were then milled into more than 1,000 bags of flour.

    The workers in Wang Enxiang's group are mostly older or in poor health. Their job is to manage the scrap materials, which originally only required collecting the scraps from the wheat, bagging them, and weighing them. However, they meticulously sifted and washed the bran and wheat husks that fell from the flour milling machines, picking out hundreds of jin of wheat from the scrap materials every day and handing it over to the warehouse.

    The employees have great respect for the elderly workers in this group, and at the end of last year, they were selected as an advanced group in the entire factory.

    从麦壳糠土里找粮食
    据新华社讯　天津市公私合营福星面粉厂制粉车间下脚小组王恩祥等七个老工人，去年把制面粉的下脚——麦壳、糠土细筛、细拣，挑出十四万多斤小粒的、半空半实的麦子，磨成了一千多袋面粉。
    王恩祥小组的工人都是年岁较大或者身体不好的老工人。他们担负整理下脚的工作，本来只要把麦子里弄出来的下脚收拣起来，装成袋，过一下磅就行了。但是他们把制面粉机器上落下来的糠土、麦壳，一撮一撮地拿来筛拣和淘洗，每天都要从下脚里选出百十来斤麦子交到仓库里去。
    职工们对这个小组的老年工人很尊敬，去年年底大家评选他们为全厂的先进小组。
