Xinhua News Agency, Wenzhou. Dachen Island, which has only been liberated for two years, has now become a prosperous fishing port. During the nearing end of the hairtail season, there were nearly 30,000 fishermen at its peak, sailing over 4,000 fishing boats to fish in the Dachen fishing grounds. In the approximately one-month hairtail season, the fishermen caught more than 100,000 dan (a unit of weight) of hairtail and yellow croaker.

With the recovery and development of fishery production, commercial development on Dachen Island has also been rapid. When it was first liberated, the streets were deserted; now there are dozens of newly opened shops. Various service industries such as catering, hairdressing, and mending are constantly increasing. The recently completed fish processing plant has a capacity of up to 9 million jin (another unit of weight).

Dachen Island is a natural harbor of refuge from the wind, with fishing grounds nearby, few reefs, warm currents, and abundant fish, making it suitable for fishing all year round. Before liberation, under the rule of the Chiang army and sea bandits, fishermen from other places dared not come to fish. Not long after liberation, fishermen from other places did not come often because they were not familiar with this fishing ground. Since last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Aquatic Products Department has successively established more than 20 lighthouses, navigation marks, and a storm warning station in the Dachen fishing grounds, and has organized fishermen from various places to exchange technical experience, so more and more fishermen are coming to fish.

    大陈岛——繁荣的渔港
    据新华社温州电　解放只有两年的大陈岛，现在已经变成了繁荣的渔港。在即将结束的带鱼汛中，最多时有近三万渔民，驾着四千多条渔船，在大陈渔场捕鱼。在大约一个月的带鱼汛中，渔民们共捕到了十多万担带鱼、黄鱼。
    随着渔业生产的恢复和发展，大陈岛上的商业发展也很快。刚解放的时候，街道上冷冷清清；现在已经有几十家新开设的商店。饮食、理发、织补等各种服务性行业，不断增加。最近完工的鱼货加工厂，容量可达九百万斤。
    大陈岛是一个天然的避风良港，渔场近，暗礁少，潮流暖，鱼类多，一年四季都可以捕捞。解放前，在蒋军和海匪统治下，外地渔民不敢前来捕鱼。解放后不久，外地渔民因为不熟悉这个渔场，所以来的也不多。去年以来，浙江省水产部门在大陈渔场先后设立了二十多个灯塔、航标和一个暴风警报站，并且组织各地渔民交流技术经验，来捕鱼的渔民就越来越多了。
