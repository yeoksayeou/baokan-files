Eliminate the "Hoarding and Speculation" Trend
By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

After the New Year, in discussions with comrades from some factories in Shenyang about this year's production tasks, they shared a common feeling: on the one hand, their confidence was high, but at the same time, everyone felt that this year would be difficult. The difficulty lay in the fact that the supply of raw materials was tight throughout last year, and it would remain tight this year, possibly even more so. For most state-owned factories in Shenyang, the materials allocated by the state could only meet about 50% of their production needs, and for some, only about 30%. With such a large shortage of materials, life would naturally not be easy.

Now, it seems unlikely, or even impossible, to alleviate the tension by relying on the state to supply more materials. There is only one way out: to fully exploit the potential of existing materials.

Some people believe that after a year of calculating how to tap the potential of raw materials last year, many old resources have already been exhausted. If we continue to tap this year, how much potential is left? There isn't much confidence. Of course, it is true that it will be more difficult to continue tapping potential this year than last year. But it is also unfounded to think that there is no potential to tap.

Is there any potential in raw materials? Let's look at the following facts.

It is difficult to get a clear picture of a company's assets, but it is difficult to hide them from the bank's eyes. First, let's look at the company's inventory situation from the financial statements held by the bank. Since the supply of materials became tight last year, the inventory of companies has increased almost every month. The abnormal phenomenon is that while some companies are severely short of the raw materials they need, at the same time, some materials that are not needed (but are in great demand by other companies) are overstocked and stockpiled in large quantities. According to statistics from 55 state-owned factories in Shenyang, overstocked and stockpiled materials amounted to more than 54 million yuan. This situation is not limited to Shenyang. According to statistics from 125 state-owned factories in Liaoning Province, overstocked and stockpiled materials amounted to more than 150 million yuan. At the end of the third quarter of last year, statistics from provincial and municipal local industries showed that overstocked materials amounted to more than 53 million yuan, exceeding more than 40% of the total working capital quota.

This is the overall situation. Now, let's look at specific examples. Example 1: Shenyang Cable Factory. This is one of the most important enterprises, and it is necessary to take care of its material supply. However, their excessive stockpiling affects the materials available to other enterprises. According to a survey at the end of November last year, inventory occupied 37 million yuan of capital, exceeding the working capital quota of 25 million yuan by 48%, of which bank credit amounted to 12 million yuan. According to statistics of only nine varieties, overstocked materials amounted to more than 5,600 tons. Among them, the overstocked steel strip is enough for one year and nine months of use, while non-ferrous metals such as lead and aluminum, which are in short supply on the market, are heavily stockpiled here.

Example 2: The four factories of Shenyang No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 and Dalian Machine Tool Factory had a material balance of more than 4.8 million yuan at the end of 1955, which increased to more than 10 million yuan at the end of the third quarter of 1956. More than doubled. Exceeded the state-approved working capital quota of more than 6 million yuan by 80%. Among them, the material balance of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory was more than 2 million yuan at the end of 1955, which increased sharply to 5.3 million yuan at the end of the third quarter of last year, an increase of more than 1.5 times, exceeding the working capital quota by nearly two-thirds. This factory alone stockpiled 938 tons of pig iron, scrap steel, and unqualified high-quality steel. The inventory of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory at the end of the third quarter of last year was also 1.8 times the working capital quota.

Example 3: At the end of 1955, the material balance of Shenyang No. 1 Machinery Factory was 460,000 yuan, and at the end of last year it was 1.45 million yuan, an increase of more than two times. Taking electric motors as an example, the annual consumption in 1956 was more than 7,200 units, and the national balance and allocation from higher authorities were more than 7,900 units, plus an inventory of more than 400 units, which was not only sufficient, but also more than 1,100 units. However, this factory purchased more than 3,100 units, and after exchanging more than 820 units for materials with fraternal factories, it still stockpiled more than 3,500 electric motors.

What contributes to this excessive and premature overstocking, and even large-scale hoarding of materials not needed by the factory, is mainly the influence of departmentalism. On the one hand, a large amount of raw materials is held in reserve for emergencies, and on the other hand, it serves as capital for "bartering." For example, one factory director instructed the supply department: "Buy more of what is difficult to buy, buy more of what is critical, buy more of what is in great demand, and buy more of what is small in amount." Under this instruction, the supply department bought goods whenever they saw them. By the end of last year, this factory had stockpiled steel, ball bearings, electric motors, etc., which were not needed by the factory, amounting to 500,000 yuan, while the factory's working capital quota was only 930,000 yuan. In addition, one enterprise had no money to pay even 15,000 yuan in wages at the end of the year due to the large-scale stockpiling of steel pipes, which were in short supply on the market.

If the warehouses of all systems and departments can be opened, and the materials that are not needed by this system or department, but are urgently needed by other systems or departments, and the materials that are overstocked by this system or department, but are severely short in other departments, can be reasonably adjusted, the potential of existing materials can be more fully utilized. In November last year, the Shenyang Municipal People's Bank only investigated a warehouse of the supply office of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in Shenyang and found that among the materials with an inventory of more than 20 million yuan, more than 8.2 million yuan were materials that had not been moved or rarely moved for a long time, some of which had been stockpiled for more than three years, and some had not been moved at all for one or two years. Moreover, some of them are steel pipes, steel plates, angle steel, ball bearings, etc., which are currently in urgent need. Because the materials have been left in the warehouse for a long time, some materials have deteriorated and suffered natural losses. Some of these stockpiled materials were stockpiled during the period of the former Northeast Industrial Department and the former Ministry of Heavy Industry. After being transferred to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the materials that did not meet the needs of the metallurgical industry were not handled. Since the shortage of materials began to occur, they have been even more unwilling to actively handle the long-term stockpiled materials. Similar situations exist in many other warehouses.

What is said above is only the problems that can be seen on the books. In fact, there is more to the story outside the books. Recently, the Shenyang Municipal Supervisory Department, together with other units, conducted an inspection of the inventory of enterprises and found that the phenomenon of underreporting and concealing inventory was extremely common and serious. Among the 42 units inspected, 32 units had concealed their inventories, and some of the circumstances were very bad (of course, some were due to chaotic management and not intentional concealment). The more than 90 factories under the Shenyang No. 1 Industrial Bureau had a large inventory of steel. With the help of the statistics department, they calculated the accounts once, and reported an inventory of more than 10,100 tons (including the inventory of the bureau and the company). The general survey reported on January 1 this year showed that the inventory was more than 21,000 tons, an increase of one time. After that, the supervisory department inspected 34 units under the bureau and found that the reported figures were more than 2,200 tons less than the general survey. The Municipal Handicraft Bureau estimated at the end of last year that the inventory of timber was more than 200 cubic meters, but only from one of the bureau's warehouses, it was found that there were more than 14,000 cubic meters of timber, equivalent to 370 train carriages of timber. In the past, this unit has always been considered the most "poor", but in fact, the timber in one of their warehouses accounts for nearly half of the total timber reserves of 30,000 cubic meters of local industries. The Shenyang Wood Factory reported that the number of timber was 2,700 cubic meters, but the actual number was 4,000 cubic meters, underreporting more than 1,000 cubic meters. The supervisory personnel asked the factory director why he did not truthfully report the numbers. The factory director frankly admitted: "We are mainly afraid that after the real situation of the 'family property' is exposed, the materials will be transferred away or balanced out, or the materials allocated by the higher authorities will be reduced. Therefore, we think that underreporting is always better than overreporting." This kind of thinking is quite common among some enterprise leaders.

In order to cover up excessive raw material reserves or intentionally "compress" inventory, some enterprises distribute a batch of raw materials to workshops or black warehouses. Here is an example: when the supervisory personnel went to the Shenyang Power Machinery Factory for inspection, the factory director said as soon as they met: We have no problems here. The supply section chief also said that there were no problems. The factory director was afraid that people would not believe him and said, I can also write you a guarantee. The supervisory personnel said, regardless of whether there are problems or not, let's take a look first! The results of the inspection were completely opposite to what the factory director had guaranteed. Steel of more than 250 tons was found in the black warehouses of only two workshops. The factory reported a total of only 950 tons of steel, and the amount found scattered in the warehouses of the workshops accounted for about 30% of the original reported amount.

Many such examples can be cited. This does not yet involve the stockpiling of work-in-progress during production, and the waste caused by outdated product technology and design, which is another important aspect of tapping potential. According to estimates by the Shenyang Municipal Planning Department, the metal materials scattered in the warehouses of various enterprises and supply departments in the city will not be less than 40,000 to 50,000 tons, and the value of stockpiled materials is about 100 million yuan. This amount is equivalent to half of the working capital quota of state-owned factories in the city last year.

Therefore, although there is a shortage of materials at present, there are still many materials that have not been rationally utilized. This can be definitely affirmed. The potential of raw materials is not only great, but also multi-faceted. To tap these potentials, there are two issues that deserve attention at present. One is how to thoroughly clarify the assets of enterprises. This requires organizing strong and unified leadership, mobilizing the masses to earnestly check inventory, and thoroughly identify which are needed for the enterprise's production, which are not needed for the enterprise's production, which are reasonable reserves, and which are excessive and premature overstocking. Although the recent inspection led by the supervisory department has also found many problems, the focus of the inspection is only on underreporting and omissions, and it is not to clarify the potential use of all raw materials, overstocking, and stockpiling. Moreover, this inspection was not carried out very thoroughly in other departments except for local industries. Therefore, it is necessary to consider further conducting a comprehensive inventory check. This is an important prerequisite for the rational adjustment of existing materials. The other is how to unify and rationally adjust the materials. The handling and adjustment of overstocked materials is an extremely complex issue. At present, although there are agencies for handling stockpiled materials in various localities, their power is not great, the situation is unclear, and there are not many methods. The role they play is not commensurate with the tasks they undertake. It is even more difficult to break the blockades and various obstacles between enterprises, systems, and regions. In particular, the right to handle stockpiled materials of state-owned enterprises is entirely controlled by various systems, and local governments are even more powerless. Therefore, it is necessary to seriously consider establishing appropriate agencies by the central and local governments, or expanding the local power to handle stockpiled materials, otherwise the problem will still be difficult to solve. In addition, although the work of mutual exchange of materials needs to be continued, there are obviously many problems with this work at present, and some have instead increased confusion and artificial tension. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen control and leadership, and make sure that the mutual exchange of materials is carried out in an organized manner under the leadership of relevant agencies, and the spontaneous "bartering" between enterprises should be curbed. For the materials that are particularly scarce at present, necessary measures can be considered, such as mobilizing enterprises to hand over these stockpiled materials to the state for unified allocation, and the units that transfer out the materials can be given priority in adjusting the materials they lack, but not as a condition for "bartering". Only by stopping this chaotic phenomenon can we eliminate the current trend of "hoarding and speculation" that is quite popular in enterprises. As long as the existing materials can be rationally adjusted and utilized, it will definitely be of great benefit to alleviating the current tight situation of raw materials.

    消除“囤积居奇”的风气
    本报记者  金雨困
    新年过后，在沈阳同一些工厂的同志接触中谈到今年的生产任务，他们有一个共同的感觉：一方面信心很足，同时大家又都感到今年的日子不好过。不好过的是，去年原材料的供应紧张了一年，今年仍然紧张，而且可能更紧张些。沈阳一般国营工厂，国家调拨的材料仅能满足生产需要的50％左右，有的仅有30％上下。材料缺得这么多，日子自然不会是轻松的。
    现在看来，要靠国家多供应些材料来缓和紧张情况，这种可能性很小或者根本没有。出路只有一条，充分发挥现有物资的潜力。
    有人认为：去年在挖掘原材料潜力上打了一年算盘，许多老底子也就挖得差不多了，今年还要挖，究竟有多大潜力可挖？信心不大。当然，今年继续挖掘潜力，困难要比去年多些，这是事实。但是如果认为没有什么潜力可挖，也是缺乏根据的。
    原材料的潜力究竟有没有？且看下边的事实。
    要摸清企业的家底是很困难的事情，但是它却很难瞒过银行的眼睛。先从银行掌握的资金表来看企业库存情况。从去年材料供应呈现紧张以来，企业的库存量几乎月月上升。畸形的现象是：一方面某些企业需要的原材料严重不足，而同时某些不需要的材料（但在其它企业却是极感不足的）却大量超额储备和积压。据沈阳五十五个国营工厂的统计，超额储备和积压的物资就达五千四百多万元。这种情况，不仅止于沈阳是这样。据辽宁省一百二十五个国营工厂统计，超额储备和积压物资数达一亿五千多万元。省市地方工业去年三季度末统计，超额储备的物资五千三百多万元，超过全部资金定额的40％以上。
    这是总的情况，再看具体例子。例一，沈阳电缆厂。这是很重要的企业之一，在材料供应上加以照顾很有必要。但他们储备过多，就影响其它企业的用料。据去年11月末的调查，库存占用资金三千七百多万元，超过资金定额二千五百万元的48％，其中银行信贷额就达一千二百万元。仅九个品种统计，超额储备五千六百多吨，其中超额储备的钢带即够一年九个月使用，市场上奇缺的有色金属铅铝等，在这里却是大量积压。
    例二，沈阳第一、第二、第三和大连机床厂四个厂，1955年末材料结存为四百八十多万元，1956年三季末增到一千多万元。增加了一倍多。超过国家批准的资金定额六百多万元的80％。其中沈阳第一机床厂1955年末材料结存为二百多万元，到去年第三季度末遽增到五百三十万元，增加达一倍半以上，超过资金定额近三分之二。这个厂仅生铁，废钢铁及不合格的优质钢就积压九百三十八吨。沈阳第二机床厂去年三季末的库存，也为资金定额的一点八倍。
    例三，沈阳第一机械厂1955年年末物资结存四十六万元，去年年末是一百四十五万元，增加了两倍多，以电动机为例：1956年全年耗用量为七千二百多台，国家平衡和上级拨入就有七千九百多台，加上库存四百多台，不仅够用，而且还多余一千一百多台。但是这个厂又购入三千一百多台，除以八百二十多台和兄弟厂换材料外，还积存电动机三千五百多台。
    促成这种过早过多地超额储备，甚至对本厂并不需要的物资也进行大量囤积，主要是本位主义思想在作祟，一方面掌握了大量原材料，以备不时之需，同时作为“物物交换”的资本。如有一位厂长，就曾这样指示供应科：“不好买的多买点，关键的多买点，大量需要的多买点，金额不大的多买点。”在这个指示下，供应部门见货就买。到去年年末，这个厂积压本厂不需要的钢材、滚珠、电动机等达五十万元，而该厂资金定额仅九十三万元。另外，有一个企业由于大量储备了市场最缺的钢铁管材，以致年终连一万五千元的工人工资也无钱发放。
    如果能够把各系统各部门的仓库都打开来，将本系统本部门并不需要、而旁的系统旁的部门十分需要的物资，将本系统本部门储备过多而其它部门严重不足的物资，加以合理的调剂，就能使现有物资的潜力得到更充分的运用。去年11月沈阳市人民银行仅调查了冶金工业部供应办事处在沈阳的一个仓库，就发现库存二千多万元的物资中，就有八百二十多万元是长期不动或很少动用的物资，其中有的已积压三年以上，少的也有一、二年一点未动用过。而且其中有一部分是目前亟感不足的钢管、钢板、三角钢、滚珠等。由于材料长期停留在仓库里，有些材料已发生变质和自然耗损现象。这些积压物资，有的是在前东北工业部和前重工业部时期就积压的，划归冶金工业部以后，对不合乎冶金工业需要的物资也未处理，当物资供应发生紧张现象以来，对长期积压的物资就更不愿放手积极处理。在其它仓库里，类似的情况也不少。
    上面说的仅是帐面能看到的问题，实际上帐面以外的文章更多。最近，沈阳市监察部门联合其它单位对企业库存进行了一次检查，就发现少报和隐瞒库存量的现象极为普遍和严重。在被检查的四十二个单位中就有三十二个单位有隐瞒行为，有的情节还十分恶劣
  （当然也有的是由于管理混乱而并非有意打埋伏）。沈阳第一工业局所属九十多个厂子库存钢材很多，在统计部门帮助下算了一次帐，上报库存为一万零一百多吨（包括局和公司库存），今年1月1日普查上报为二万一千多吨，增加一倍。其后，监察部门检查了该局所属三十四个单位，就发现比普查上报数字少报二千二百多吨。市手工业局去年年末预计木材库存是二百多立方公尺，但仅从一个局属仓库检查，就发现木材一万四千多立方公尺，相当于三百七十个火车皮的木材。过去这个单位一直被认为家底最“苦”，实际上他们一个仓库的木材，就占了地方工业木材储备总量三万立方公尺的近半。沈阳木器厂上报木材数是二千七百立方公尺，实际是四千立方公尺，少报了一千多立方公尺。监察人员就问厂长为什么不真实上报？这位厂长坦白地承认：“我们主要是怕‘家底’的真实情况暴露以后，物资被调走或被平衡出去，或上级调拨的物资给削减了，因此就认为少报总比多报强”。这种思想在某些企业领导干部中是相当普遍的。
    有些企业为了掩饰原材料储备过多或有意“压缩”库存，将一批原材料分散到车间或黑库中去。有这样一个例子，当监察人员到沈阳动力机械厂检查时，这个厂的厂长见面就说：我们这里没有问题。供应科长也在一旁说没有问题。厂长唯恐人家不信还说，我还可以给你们写个保证。监察人员说，不管有无问题，我们先看看吧！看看的结果却与厂长所保证的完全相反，仅从两个车间的黑仓库中就发现钢材二百五十多吨。这个厂总共上报的钢材仅九百五十多吨，而发现分散在车间里仓库中的就占了原报数的30％左右。
    还可以举出很多这样的例子。这里还没有涉及生产过程中在制品的积压、产品工艺和设计落后所造成的浪费问题，而这些又是挖掘潜力的又一个重要方面。根据沈阳市计划部门的估计，全市分散在各企业和供应部门仓库长期积压的金属材料不会少于四、五万吨，积压物资的价值约在一亿元左右。这个数目相当于全市国营工厂去年资金定额的一半。
    因此，尽管当前物资不足，但是没有得到合理运用的物资仍然还是很多。这是完全可以肯定的。原材料的潜力不仅很大，而且也是多方面的。要挖掘这些潜力，目前值得注意的有两个问题。一是如何彻底弄清企业家底的问题。这需要组织强有力的统一领导，发动群众认真清查库存，彻底鉴别哪些是本企业生产需要的，哪些是本企业生产不需要的，哪些是合理的储备，哪些是过多过早的超额储备。最近由监察部门为主的检查，虽也发现了不少问题，但由于检查的重点仅在少报漏报，并不是弄清全部原材料潜力运用，超额储备以及积压的情况，而且这个检查除了地方工业以外，在其它部门进行得并不都很彻底。因此有考虑进一步进行全面的物资清查的必要，这是合理调剂现有物资的重要前提。另一个是如何统一合理调剂的问题。处理和调剂超储积压物资是极为复杂的问题。目前地方虽设有积压物资的处理机构，但由于权力不大、情况不明、办法不多，所起作用与所负任务极不相称，更难打破企业间、系统间、地区间的封锁和种种阻力，特别是国营企业积压物资处理权全属各系统自行掌握，地方更是无能为力。因此由中央和地方设立适当的机构，或扩大地方对积压物资处理权，很有考虑的必要，否则问题仍然难于解决。此外，互通有无工作虽有继续开展的必要，但目前这个工作显然问题很多，有的相反增加了混乱和人为紧张。因此有必要加强控制和领导，务必使互通有无在有关机构领导下有组织地进行，各企业间自发性的“物物交换”应加以制止。对目前特别紧张的物资，可以考虑采取必要的措施，如动员企业将这些积压物资一律交给国家，以便进行统一的调剂分配，而对调出物资的单位所缺的物资，可优先照顾调剂，但不作为“物物交换”的条件。只有杜绝了这种混乱现象，才能消除目前企业相当流行的“囤积居奇”之风，只要现有物资能够得到合理的调剂运用，对缓和目前原材料紧张局面就一定有很大好处。
