Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 21st: The Wuhan-Daye-Huangshi railway construction project, connecting Wuhan, Daye Tieshan, and Huangshi, has already laid tracks for more than 50 kilometers southeast from Wuchang. A person in charge of building this railway said that the entire line could be open to traffic before October 1 this year.

The railway is 81.2 kilometers long. Since construction began in May of last year, about 90% of the earthwork has been completed.
