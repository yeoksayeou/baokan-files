Cotton farmers, sell your surplus cotton to the state

This year's cotton purchasing work is progressing very slowly. From September 1, 1956, to January 25, 1957, the national cotton purchasing quantity only completed 78.43% of the original plan. This is a decrease of approximately one-seventh compared to the purchasing quantity during the same period of the previous year. If this trend is not resolutely reversed, the cotton purchased this year will be about 2.5 million dan less than last year. This situation is serious. This will have a very unfavorable impact on textile industry production and market cloth supply, that is to say, it will have a very unfavorable impact on the lives of the broad masses of people and the state's economic and financial situation. Party committees and governments at all levels must seriously treat this urgent and important issue, resolutely and quickly take effective measures, work diligently, and strengthen the cotton purchasing work. We especially hope that cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas will quickly sell their surplus cotton to the state in order to meet the ever-growing needs of the people for cotton cloth and other necessities.

Because several cotton-producing areas suffered severe natural disasters last year, the total national cotton production was much lower than originally planned, and therefore the original national cotton purchasing plan naturally could not be completed. However, because the cotton harvested area in 1956 increased compared to 1955, especially due to the realization of agricultural cooperativization, areas that did not suffer disasters all had a bumper cotton harvest in 1956, so the total national cotton production in 1956 was not lower than in 1955. Therefore, the cotton purchasing quantity this year should not be less than last year. This means that there is indeed a lot of cotton that should be purchased in the countryside that has not been purchased, and many cotton farmers still have surplus cotton that has not been sold.

The reason why this year's cotton purchasing work has not been as smooth as in previous years is mainly because in some areas, after agricultural cooperativization, on the one hand, the number of people retaining cotton has increased; on the other hand, the amount of cotton retained by farmers has also exceeded the prescribed cotton retention standards, and some farmers even retain an average of more than ten jin of cotton per person. At the same time, some agricultural cooperatives in some places also have a lot of cotton stored in their public accumulation funds. After the opening of the free market in some areas, agricultural cooperatives and farmers are not serious enough about completing the state's unified purchase tasks. They retain more cotton, intending to sell it on the free market and sell it for a higher price. Some agricultural cooperatives in some areas have unreasonable phenomena in the cotton picking work point recording system, so that some members, in order to pursue quantity, carry out the picking work relatively crudely, and cotton bolls and lint are left on the cotton stalks and not picked cleanly. For example, investigation materials from Hebei and Henan show that two or three jin to five or six jin of cotton can still be picked from the cotton stalks per mu of cotton field. This is a large amount. In addition, some areas have not done a good job in cotton purchasing, which also has a certain impact on the completion of the cotton purchasing task.

Based on the above situation, cotton farmers in all cotton-producing areas across the country should immediately mobilize, in the spirit of patriotism, obey the needs of the state, and sell more surplus cotton. All party and government leading organs and cotton purchasing departments in cotton-producing areas should make a special arrangement and inspection of the current cotton purchasing work, and take effective measures based on the actual situation in various places to earnestly strengthen the cotton purchasing work. As long as everyone actively works hard and does a good job, it is entirely possible to complete the cotton purchasing task.

Agricultural cooperatives and the masses of farmers in cotton-producing areas should save cotton as much as possible and sell the surplus cotton to the state. This is not only a contribution to national construction, but also beneficial to agricultural cooperatives and farmers themselves. As for the small amount of cotton that cotton farmers truly use for themselves, no one has the right to force them to sell it. Agricultural cooperatives in cotton-producing areas should organize farmers to seize the time and quickly pick the remaining cotton bolls and lint from the cotton stalks and sell them to the state to increase the income of agricultural cooperatives and farmers. This is also helpful in solving the difficulties in production and life during the spring plowing period. An'yi County in Shanxi Province mobilized 11,000 people to pick more than 189,000 jin of seed cotton from cotton stalks in twelve days, increasing their income by more than 40,000 yuan, which is a very good example. Agricultural cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas will get the same harvest if they carefully check the remaining cotton bolls and lint in the cotton fields.

For cotton purchasing departments, we require them to actively improve their working methods, dispatch mobile teams deep into the producing areas to carry out purchases based on the characteristics of the busy farming season and farmers' sporadic sales of stored cotton. It is necessary to ensure that wherever there is cotton for sale, we go there to buy it. The cotton sold by farmers, no matter how small the quantity, should be purchased in a timely manner. In short, we should try every means in all aspects to strive to give the state more cotton.

### 棉农们，把余棉卖给国家

    棉农们，把余棉卖给国家
    今年的棉花收购工作进展很慢。从1956年9月1日起到1957年1月25日止，全国的棉花收购数量只完成原计划的78.43％。比上一年度的同一期间的收购数量减少了约七分之一。如果不坚决扭转这个趋势，本年度收购的棉花就会比上年度减少二百五十万担左右。这个情况是严重的。这将使纺织工业生产和市场纱布供应受到很不利的影响，也就是说，将使广大人民生活和国家经济财政状况受到很不利的影响。各地党委和政府必须严肃地对待这个迫切的重大的问题，坚决地迅速地采取有效措施，努力负责，加强棉花的收购工作。我们特别希望产棉区的棉农们，为了满足全国人民对于棉布等必需品不断增长的需要，赶快把余棉卖给国家。
    因为去年有若干产棉区遭受了严重的自然灾害，全国棉花的总产量比原定计划减少很多，因而原定的全国棉花收购计划自然也不能完成。但是，由于1956年棉花的收获面积比1955年有了增加，特别是由于实现了农业合作化，凡是没有遭灾的地区，1956年棉花都丰收了，所以1956年全国的棉花总产量并不低于1955年。因此，本年度棉花收购数量是不应该比上年度减少的。这就是说，农村中确实还有不少应该收购的棉花没有收购，许多棉农家里还有余棉没有出卖。
    今年的棉花收购工作所以没有往年那样进行得顺利，主要是因为某些地区在农业合作化以后，一方面留用棉花的人数增多；另一方面农民留用棉花的数量也超过了规定的留棉标准，甚至有的农户每人平均留用棉花竟有十多斤。同时，有些地方农业社的公积金中还存有不少棉花。有些地区在开放自由市场以后，农业社和农民对于完成国家统购任务不够认真，他们多留下一部分棉花，打算在自由市场上出售，多卖些价钱。有些地区农业社在采摘棉花的评工记分制度方面有不合理的现象，以致部分社员为了追求数量，采摘工作进行得比较粗糙，在棉稭上还残留着棉桃和棉绒没有采摘干净。比如河北、河南的调查材料说明，一亩棉田的棉稭上还可以摘下的棉花有二、三斤以至五、六斤不等。这是一个很大的数目。此外，有些地区棉花收购工作没有作得很好，对于完成棉花收购任务也有一定的影响。
    根据上述情况，全国各个产棉地区的棉农们应该马上动员起来，本着爱国主义的精神，服从国家需要，多卖余棉。所有棉花产区的党政领导机关和棉花收购部门，应该把当前的棉花收购工作做一次专门的布置和检查，根据各地的实际情况，采取有效的办法，认真地把棉花的收购工作加强起来。只要大家积极努力，做好工作，完成购棉任务是完全可能的。
    产棉区的农业社和农民群众应该尽量节约用棉，把余棉出卖给国家。这样作不仅对国家建设是一种贡献，就是对农业社和农民本身也是有利的。至于棉农真正自用的少量棉花，谁也无权强迫他们出售。产棉区的农业合作社应该组织农民，争取时间，迅速地把棉稭上残存的棉桃和棉绒采摘下来，卖给国家，以增加农业社和农民的收入。这对解决春耕期间生产和生活上的困难也是有补助的。山西省安邑县发动一万一千人用十二天的时间，从棉稭上摘出十八万九千多斤籽棉，增加了四万多元的收入，就是一个很好的例子。各产棉区的农业社如果认真检查一下棉田里残余的棉桃和棉绒，就将会得到同样的收获。
    对于棉花收购部门，我们要求他们积极改进工作方法，根据农忙和农民零星出售存棉的特点，派出流动小组，深入产地进行收购。要做到哪里有棉花卖，就到哪里去买。农民出售的棉花，不管数量多少，都应该及时地加以收购。总之，应该从各个方面想尽办法，努力给国家以更多的棉花。
