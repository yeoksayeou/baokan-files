Thrift is Everywhere; Careful Observation Leads to Learning

    Direct Allocation Saves Circulation Costs
    Since Hubei Province opened free markets in July of last year, some grassroots units of supply and marketing cooperatives, in order to reduce business links, have directly sent more than ten kinds of products such as waste rubber, charcoal, honey, and lotus seeds to production units and consumers, saving the state more than 120,000 yuan in commodity circulation costs.
    The waste rubber purchased by the Guangji County Supply and Marketing Cooperative used to be transported from Guangji County along the Yangtze River to Wuhan (Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative), and then from Wuhan via Guangji County to Shanghai. Now, the waste rubber is directly transported to Shanghai according to the provincial cooperative's control plan; in this way, the freight cost per ton of waste rubber is reduced by 17 yuan, and the transportation time en route is also saved by half a month each time. The Provincial Native Products and Non-staple Food Management Office directly distributes the charcoal transported from various places to Wuhan to consumers at the place of departure, reducing the cost by more than 2.1 yuan per ton of charcoal.
    In order to reduce business links and implement direct allocation, the provincial and county-level supply and marketing cooperatives implemented a unified accounting system of "28" profit sharing (county cooperative gets 80% of the profit, provincial cooperative gets 20%), which solved the past disputes between supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels on profits and gave play to the business enthusiasm of the county cooperatives.

    After Changing "Opposite Transportation"
    Staff members of the Dezhou City Grain Bureau Storage and Transportation Section in Shandong Province put forward a rationalization proposal, saving the country more than 8,500 yuan. In December last year, Dezhou City's grain transportation plan stipulated that 1.8 million jin of wheat should be transferred from Dong'e County to Dezhou City via Luokou. The grain transportation plan of Huimin Prefecture also stipulated that 2 million jin of wheat should be transferred from Huimin and Leling to Jinan via Dezhou. Obviously, this is "opposite transportation." After discovering this problem, the comrades of the Transportation Section, especially Wang Junhai and Yuan Jingshan, who were responsible for transportation, took the initiative to contact the Huimin Prefectural Grain Bureau, the Liaocheng Prefectural Grain Bureau, and the Shandong Provincial Grain Department to request changes to the plan. As a result, the country saved more than 8,500 yuan in train freight and loading and unloading costs; it also saved transportation tools—sixty-six train cars. (Wang Guoqing)

    The Origin of Forty Thousand Feet of Hemp Rope
    In the past, the Dawangqiao Tobacco Leaf Purchasing Station in Guangrao County, Shandong Province, used long ropes cut into short ropes to tie up tobacco bales, wasting one foot or half a foot of rope per rope. Now, in order to save hemp, the workers have formulated rope usage standards and use the excess rope ends to connect them. In this way, two feet of hemp rope can be saved for each tobacco bale. This station binds 20,000 tobacco bales every year, saving 40,000 feet of rope.

    Recycling Waste Oil into Useful Oil
    The Qiqihar Petroleum Company in Heilongjiang Province reprocesses and refines waste oil into useful oil, increasing the country's production of machine oil by 145 tons and increasing profits by about 50,000 yuan. Due to the insufficient source of these oils, the company sent people to factories, mines, enterprises, and nearby farm departments in the city to recover waste oil. It has now purchased 289 tons of various waste oils, and after processing, there are 145 tons of usable oils, including vehicle engine oil, machine oil, new agricultural implement oil, soft grease, and other oils. These oils have played a certain role in adjusting the market shortage and supplying the urgent needs of factories and mines. This practice has also promoted greater oil conservation and care for waste oil in various factories and mines. The company is now continuing to expand the purchase of waste oil.

    Recycling Wooden Crates Saves More Than 60,000 Yuan
    After the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Pharmaceutical Company began implementing the method of recycling wooden crates in the third quarter of 1955, in just over a year, it has recovered more than 1.5 million jin of wooden crate boards from provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Shanghai, and Qingdao, equivalent to 1,250 cubic meters of wood. The recovered wooden crate boards have been processed into more than 50,000 wooden crates. More than 30,000 jin of iron nails and more than 10,000 jin of iron sheets removed from old wooden crates have also been well utilized, saving a total of more than 67,000 yuan. Now they are expanding the recycling areas and scope, preparing to also recycle oil drums, iron cans, cardboard boxes, and medicine bottles of certain specifications, in order to save more packaging materials, reduce commodity circulation costs, and accumulate more funds for the country.

    Collect Feathers
    Feathers are an export commodity. Recently, due to the successive opening of free markets in various places, many farmers have brought poultry such as chickens, ducks, and geese to the city to sell directly to consumers. Many people do not know that feathers have many uses and discard them casually. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay attention to this issue and find ways to collect scattered feathers.

    节约之道处处有，到处留心皆学问
    直接拨货节约了流转费用
    湖北省在去年7月开放自由市场后，有些供销社基层单位为了减少经营环节，把废胶、木炭、蜂蜜、莲子等十余种产品直接送给生产单位和消费者，为国家节省了十二万余元商品流转费用。
    广济县供销社收购的废胶，过去是先由广济县沿长江运到武汉（省供销社），再由武汉经广济县下运到上海。现在把废胶按省社控制计划直接运到上海去；这样，每吨废胶仅运费就节省了十七元，每次还节省了途中的运输时间半个月。省社土产副食品管理处，把从各地运送到武汉的木炭，在起货地点直接分给消费者，每吨木炭可减少费用二元一角多。
    为了减少经营环节，实行直接调拨，省、县两级供销社实行了“二八”分利润的统一核算制度（县社分八成利润，省社分二成），解决了过去各级供销社在利润上的争执，发挥了县社的经营积极性。

    改变“相向运输”以后
    山东德州市粮食局储运股人员，提出一件合理化建议，为国家节约八千五百多元。去年12月，德州市的运粮计划中规定由东阿县经洛口转运一百八十万斤小麦到德州市。惠民专区的运粮计划中又规定由惠民、乐陵经德州转运小麦二百万斤到济南。显然，这是“相向运输”。运输股的同志，特别是负责运输的王俊海和袁景山同志，发现这问题后，即主动和惠民专署粮食局、聊城专署粮食局、山东省粮食厅联系要求变更计划。结果，为国家节约了八千五百多元的火车运费、装卸搬运费；还节约了运输工具——六十六个火车皮。　（王国庆）
    四万尺麻绳的来历
    山东广饶县大王桥烟叶采购站，过去绑扎烟包都是用长绳截成短绳用，一条绳子要浪费一尺或半尺。现在，为了节约用麻，工人们制定了用绳标准，把多余的绳头连接起来使用。这样，每个烟包即可节约麻绳二尺。这个站每年绑烟包二万个，可节约绳子四万尺。

    回收废油炼成有用的油
    黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市石油公司用废杂油料再加工提炼成有用的油，为国家增产机器用油一百四十五吨，增加利润约五万元。由于这些油类的来源不足，这个公司派人到本市各厂矿、企业和附近各县农场等部门回收废油，现已收购了各种废油二百八十九吨，经过加工后已能使用的有车用机油、机器油、新式农具油、软黄油及其他油等共一百四十五吨。这些油对调剂市场有无和供应厂矿急需都起了一定作用。这种做法也促使各厂矿更节约用油和爱护废油。现在这个公司还在继续扩大收购废油。
                      （曹书元）
    回收木箱节约六万多元
    中国医药公司上海采购供应站在1955年第三季度开始实行木箱回笼的办法后，一年多来，仅从浙江、江苏、福建、上海、青岛等省市就回收了木箱板一百五十几万斤，折合木材一千二百五十立方公尺。回收的木箱板经过加工做成了五万多只木箱。从旧木箱上拆下的三万多斤铁钉和一万多斤铁皮，也都被很好地利用了，共节约费用六万七千多元。现在他们正在扩大回收地区和回收范围，准备对油桶、铁罐、麻板纸箱和一定规格的药瓶子也进行回收，以便节约更多的包装材料，降低商品流转费，为国家积累更多的资金。　（李绍唐）
    把羽毛搜集起来
    羽毛是一种出口商品。最近由于各地先后开放了自由市场，许多农民把鸡、鸭、鹅等家禽带到城里直接卖给消费者。许多人不知道羽毛有许多用途，就把它随便丢掉。希望有关部门注意这个问题，设法把零散的羽毛搜集起来。　（林烽）
