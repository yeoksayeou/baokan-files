    Eisenhower "Furious"
    On the eve of the arrival of the King of Saudi Arabia, who was visiting the United States, at the port of New York, a rather unsightly quarrel broke out among the American dignitaries over the issue of receiving this state guest. According to a United Press report on the 27th, the powerful Governor of New York State and the Mayor of New York City insisted on their "pro-Jewish nationalism" and anti-Arab attitude, "refusing to extend the usual courtesies of welcome to these formal guests." However, the US President had other plans, demanding an extraordinary "warm welcome," and was therefore "furious" at the actions of the New York State authorities, ordering the federal government to take over the state government's handling of foreign guests.
    The United States, which practices racism and discriminates against people of color, has always shown great disrespect to the leaders of Asian countries. For example, when the Prime Minister of Burma visited the United States in 1955, he was subjected to a very rude reception—outside the office of US Secretary of Agriculture Benson, he "was asked to announce his name to a receptionist" and sat on a cold bench for five minutes without the host coming out to greet him. On that occasion, the US President was not dissatisfied with Benson's neglect of foreign guests. Why was he so angry with the New York State authorities this time?
    Another United Press dispatch revealed the reason: it turned out that the US President was trying to use a "warm" "welcome" to "vigorously induce the Saudi Arabian leader to sympathize with the Eisenhower Doctrine on the Middle East," hoping to "establish more military facilities in Saudi Arabia and train the Saudi Arabian army," and hoping that "Saudi Arabia might be able to influence Egyptian President Nasser." In order to achieve these sinister goals, Eisenhower did not hesitate to lower himself, personally going to the airport to greet the foreign guest for the first time. He originally intended to use a hypocritical smile to promote his colonialist plan of aggression in the Middle East, but his insensitive subordinates insisted on undermining him. No wonder Eisenhower was "furious." (Ping)

### 艾森豪威尔“勃然大怒”

    艾森豪威尔“勃然大怒”
    正在美国访问的沙特阿拉伯国王抵达纽约港的前夕，美国权贵们为了接待这位国宾的问题发生了一场颇不体面的争吵。据合众社27日报道，有势力的纽约州州长和纽约市市长，坚持他们的“亲犹太民族主义”和反对阿拉伯人的态度，“不肯给予这些正式客人以通常礼节的欢迎”。可是，美国总统却另有打算，他要求破格地“热烈欢迎”一番，因而对纽约州当局的行动“勃然大怒”，并且命令联邦政府接管了州政府的招待外宾事宜。
    奉行种族主义、歧视有色人种的美国，对待亚洲国家的领导人向来是极不尊重的。例如，1955年缅甸总理访问美国的时候，就曾受到一场十分无礼的接待——他在美国农业部长本逊的办公处门外，“被要求向一个接待员通名报姓”，并且坐了五分钟冷板凳还没有主人出来招待。那一次，美国总统对于本逊这种怠慢外宾的行为并无不满，为什么这回却向纽约州当局大发脾气呢？
    合众社的另一则电讯道出了此中底细：原来，美国总统是企图用“热烈”的“欢迎”来“大力诱使这位沙特阿拉伯领袖同情关于中东的艾森豪威尔主义”，希望“在沙特阿拉伯建立更多的军事设备和训练沙特阿拉伯军队”，并且希望“沙特可能能够影响埃及总统纳赛尔”。为了要达到这些阴险目的，艾森豪威尔不惜放下架子，自己第一次出马到飞机场迎接外宾。他本来想用一脸虚伪的笑容来推销他的侵略中东的殖民主义计划，然而他的不识时务的下属们却偏要拆他的台。这就难怪艾森豪威尔要“勃然大怒”了。　　　（平）
