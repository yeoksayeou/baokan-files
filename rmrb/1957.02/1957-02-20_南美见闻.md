South American Impressions

The Theaters of Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, is widely recognized as the cultural center of South America. This is not only because it has been the publishing and printing center of Spanish since the Spanish Civil War, nor is it only because it has some of the oldest universities with the most complete departments in South America, several record manufacturing plants, a dozen film studios, and hundreds of cinemas, but also because it has many well-designed theaters that frequently stage the world's most famous dramas and music. Among the most famous are the Columbus Theatre, named after the discoverer of the Americas, and the National Cervantes Comedy Theatre, named after the great Spanish writer.

The Columbus Theatre is a perfectly constructed theater. It is said that only the Paris Opera House, Milan's "La Scala" theater, and the Moscow Grand Theatre have similar scales, and even the Metropolitan Opera House in the United States cannot match the Columbus Theatre's facilities.

This is an Italian-style opera house with a circular auditorium, and the interior decoration maintains a simple and solemn Italian style, unlike the luxurious Paris Opera House. The sound effect is surprisingly perfect. Chinese artists have personally experienced this advantage when performing in this theater. Although the stage is high and deep, soloists and soloists can transmit the sound clearly to every corner of the theater, whether it is the first row or the last row, the stalls or the sixth floor known as "heaven".

The Columbus Theatre has opera troupes, dance troupes, choirs, and symphony orchestras of a good standard. We watched Mozart's opera "The Marriage of Figaro", which was performed by its opera troupe in cooperation with guest actors from England. George London from London played Count Almaviva, and Lisa Casa from the local area played the Countess. The conductor was Leitner from West Berlin. This performance was serious and conscientious, unlike some Western opera houses, where the troupe sings in French or German, while the guest protagonists sing in Italian, and the famous protagonists do not rehearse with the troupe at all before going on stage.

We also watched some dance dramas at the Columbus Theatre. Among them was "Paganini", choreographed by Mi Fokin, one of the most famous dance drama choreographers of the early 20th century, based on the music of the great composer Rachmaninoff. This is a story about the famous violinist Paganini. The music is beautiful, but the entire drama uses dance to describe certain abstract concepts, rather than expressing them through images and concrete, systematic stories, making it difficult for the audience to understand well, and even more difficult to achieve the effect of infecting the audience.

The National Cervantes Comedy Theatre was built in the 1920s. The Renaissance-style decoration makes this small theater look quaint.

Argentine writer Barbil's historical drama "Facundo" is currently being performed. This drama depicts the story of a cruel governor of Argentina, and the handling form is quite unique. But like many modern Western playwrights' scripts, it often has too much dialogue and relatively few truly dramatic scenes.

Like many Western theaters that have museums attached, the Columbus Theatre and the Cervantes Comedy Theatre also have good museums. Our actors gave each of the two theater museums a costume, which caused two or three hundred Argentine dramatists present to rush forward, vying to try on the gifts.

The museum of the Columbus Theatre also held a Chinese art exhibition specifically to cooperate with the performance of the Chinese art troupe. The hall of this theater was filled with ivory carvings, jade carvings, embroidery, paintings, ceramics, and furniture, making many viewers who visited the exhibition during the intermission reluctant to leave.

Some Impressions of South America

After returning to China, many comrades asked us what our impressions of South America were. This question is difficult to answer in one or two sentences. But one point is very prominent, and that is the friendly attitude of ordinary people towards China.

South American people respect China's ancient cultural traditions very much. Many intellectuals can recite the translated versions of Tang poems, and one-fifth of the exhibits in the National Museum of Decorative Arts in Argentina are Chinese artworks. When people mention Chinese culture, regardless of their political views, there are rarely different evaluations in this regard. Although some people do not fully understand our current political life due to malicious propaganda, the South American people, who have a tradition of striving for independence and freedom, always have a sympathetic attitude towards the independence, autonomy, and economic construction of New China. In particular, the South American people have suffered deeply from American economic aggression, and there are many feelings in this regard.

The people of South American countries have a warm and simple character and are very easy to approach. They love their local cultural relics, and if they treat their folk art with the curiosity of a traveler, they will often encounter silent indifference. In many artistic creations, the people of South American countries have shown extremely high talents. Not to mention Neruda, who is well-known all over the world, his poems have become folk songs. I will never forget that on the gate and courtyard walls of Neruda's villa, many visiting guests signed their names there to pay tribute to the poet, many of which were crooked, and were likely the handwriting of nearby fishermen. I have also heard at an evening party a skilled player of ancient hand harps playing Bach's inventions and preludes on the accordion, making people hold their breath and concentrate. Another female singer sang 15th and 16th century Spanish folk songs and Mozart's pieces, her voice clear as water. We firmly believe that the people with such talents will create a brilliant future.

China and South America are too far apart, but friendly direct contact can quickly and well promote mutual understanding. Our days of traveling in South America, especially the South American people's infinitely enthusiastic welcome and reception to us, will be the most beautiful memories of our artists.

### 南美见闻

    南美见闻
    赵沨
    布宜诺斯艾利斯的剧院
    阿根廷的首都布宜诺斯艾利斯被公认为南美的文化中心。这不仅是因为它从西班牙内战以来就成为西班牙语的出版印刷中心，也不仅是因为它有着南美洲历史最久、学系最完整的几所大学、拥有好几家唱片制造厂、十来个影片摄制厂和上百家电影院，还因为它有着许多建筑讲究的剧院，经常演出世界最著名的戏剧、音乐。其中最著名的就是以美洲大陆的发现者命名的哥伦布剧院和以伟大的西班牙作家命名的国立塞万提斯喜剧院。
    哥伦布剧院是一个建筑完美的剧场。据说，只有巴黎的歌剧院、米兰的“斯卡拉”剧院和莫斯科大剧院才有类似的规模，连美国的大都会歌剧院都赶不上哥伦布剧院的设备条件。
    这是一个意大利式的圆形观众厅的歌剧院，内部装饰保持着朴素而庄严的意大利风格，不像巴黎歌剧院那样的豪华。音响效果惊人的完美。中国艺术家在这个剧场演出时亲身体验过它的这个优点。舞台虽然又高又深，但独奏和独唱都能把声音同样清晰地传送到剧场的每个角落，无论是第一排或最后一排，池座或被称为“天堂”的六层楼。
    哥伦布剧院有着水平不错的歌剧团、舞剧团、合唱团和交响乐队。我们看过一出莫扎特的歌剧“费加罗的婚礼”，就是由它的歌剧团的班底配合英国的客串演员演出的。伦敦来的乔治·伦敦扮演阿尔玛维瓦伯爵，当地的丽萨·卡萨演夫人。指挥是西柏林来的莱特纳。这个演出是严肃认真的，不像有些西方歌剧院，班底唱法文或德文，而客串的主角唱意大利文，名主角根本不和班底在一起排演便一下子上了台。
    我们在哥伦布剧院还看过一些舞剧。其中有本世纪初年最有名的舞剧编作者之一米·福金根据大作曲家拉赫玛尼诺夫的音乐编的“帕格尼尼”。这是描写著名的提琴家帕格尼尼的故事。音乐是美丽的，但整个剧是用舞蹈来描写某些抽象的概念，而不是通过形象和具体、系统的故事来表现的，因而使观众难于很好地理解，更难以获得感染观众的效果。
    国立塞万提斯喜剧院，是在本世纪的二十年代建立的。文艺复兴式的装饰使这个小剧院显得古趣盎然。
    阿根廷作家巴尔比利写的历史剧“法空多”正在演出，这个剧描写一个阿根廷的残暴的总督的故事，处理形式上有着相当独到的地方。但它也像许多现代的西方剧作家写的剧本一样，常常有着过多的对白而比较缺少真正的戏剧性的场面。
    像许多西方剧院都附设有博物馆一样，哥伦布剧院和塞万提斯喜剧院也有着很好的博物馆。我国的演员们送给这两个剧院博物馆各一件戏装，这使在场的二、三百个阿根廷的戏剧家们，一拥上前，争着要把礼物试穿一下。
    哥伦布剧院的博物馆还专为配合中国艺术团的演出而举办了中国艺术品展览会。这个剧院的大厅里满摆着牙刻、玉雕、刺绣、绘画、陶瓷器和家俱，使得许多在演出休息时参观展览的观众们依依不舍。
    对南美洲的一些印象
    回国之后，许多同志问我们对南美的印象怎样。这个问题很难用一两句话来回答。但有一点是很突出的，那就是普通人民对中国所持的友好态度。
    南美人民对中国古老的文化传统很尊重。许多知识分子会背诵唐诗的译文，阿根廷的国立装饰艺术馆中有五分之一的展品是中国艺术品。人们一提起中国的文化，不论政治主张有什么不同，在这一方面很少有不同的评价。尽管有些人由于受到恶意的宣传，对我国现在的政治生活还不十分了解，但是，有着争取独立、自由的传统的南美人民，对新中国的独立自主和经济建设总是抱着同情的态度。特别是南美人民深受美国的经济侵略之苦，在这一点上更有许多感慨。
    南美各国人民有着热情、质朴的性格，极易亲近。他们热爱自己的乡土文物，如果用旅行家那种猎奇趣味的态度来对待他们的民间艺术，常会遭到沉默的冷遇。而在许多艺术创作方面，南美各国人民显示了极高的才能。不说像全世界都熟知的聂鲁达，他的诗已经变成了民歌。我永远不能忘记，在聂鲁达别墅的大门上和院墙上，许多来访的客人在那里签上自己的名字向诗人致敬，其中有许多字迹歪斜，很可能就是附近渔人们的手迹。我也曾在晚会上听见一位演奏古式手琴的能手用手风琴演奏巴哈的创意曲和序曲，使人屏息凝神。另一位女歌唱家演唱十五、六世纪的西班牙民歌和莫扎特的曲子，声音清澈如水。我们深信，有着如此的才能的人民，一定会创造一个辉煌的未来。
    中国和南美距离太远了，但通过友好的直接接触能很快地、很好地相互了解。我们在南美旅行的日子，特别是南美人民对我们无限热情的欢迎和接待，将是我国艺术家们的最美好的记忆。　（全文完）（附图片）
