    Guangzhou Shipyard Under Expansion
    The state-owned Guangzhou Shipyard, the largest ship repair enterprise in South China, is undergoing expansion. A brand-new engine workshop building has now been completed; a ship repair pier stretching 400 meters long has been built on the banks of the Pearl River.
    Once completed, this massive shipyard will be able to handle the repair of the largest ships currently operating along the South China coast, as well as the manufacture of large ocean-going vessels and various types of passenger and cargo ships. (Photo by Zhao Muzhi, Southern Daily)

    扩建中的广州船舶修造厂
    华南最大的修船企业——国营广州船舶修造厂正在扩建。现在，一座崭新的轮机车间厂房已经落成；长达四百多公尺的修船码头已经建立在珠江河畔。
    这个庞大的船舶修造厂扩建完成后，足以负担修理目前华南沿海最大的船舶及制造大型的海轮和各种类型的客货船舶。　赵慕志摄（南方日报社稿）
