    A Master of Saving Steel	崔诚五
    Early in the morning, braving the cold wind, I asked the workers in the processing workshop of the Anshan Metal Structure Manufacturing Factory several times, but they all said that Wei Qingyu had not yet arrived. "Strange, this man who has consistently arrived half an hour to an hour early for work for the past few years, what's the exception today?" With a puzzled heart, I walked out of the workshop once again.
    Suddenly, a clanging of steel came from the distance. Following the sound, I saw two people rummaging through something in the northeast corner of the workshop. From their backs, I recognized one of them as Wei Qingyu.
    After he learned that I wanted to talk to him about his steel-saving efforts over the years, he said modestly, "What's there to talk about!" As he spoke, he and his companions sorted out the scattered old steel materials and turned to lead me into the workshop.
    We passed through a workshop equipped with various new-style machines, stepped over piles of strangely shaped steel materials, and arrived at a spacious area. "Come on, let's talk here, this is our workplace."
    I didn't speak for a moment, but I remembered a few months ago, at the Anshan Advanced Producers Conference, everyone enthusiastically discussed Wei Qingyu's steel-saving deeds, telling of Wei Qingyu's noble character in cherishing state property. I had fully expected Wei Qingyu's work site to be complex. Who knew that there wasn't even a single simple machine here, all there was were piles of steel materials on the ground, a few long rulers, a few white paintbrushes, and soapstone pencils. Truly, extraordinary achievements were created in an extremely ordinary position!
      "Our job is very simple!" Wei Qingyu seemed to see through my thoughts, "The production section issues the drawings, and we just draw lines on the steel materials accordingly!... Although the work is simple, it can't be said that it's not important. We are the first process in the whole factory, and also the most important process in determining whether steel is saved or wasted. Precisely because of this, we all love our job very much and strive to do it well!"
    A young man quietly walked in and listened to Wei Qingyu speaking. He seemed to want to say something, but for some reason didn't open his mouth.
      "Saving steel, yes, I have saved more than two hundred tons of steel over the past few years." Wei Qingyu continued, "But what's there to say about that? It's just doing the minimum that a worker should do. How difficult it is for a ton of steel to come about! From ore to iron to steel to steel materials, I don't know how much blood and sweat it takes. If we don't use it very reasonably, it will not only cause a great waste, but also disrespect other people's labor... The steel materials we use are even harder to come by, many of them are imported from abroad, if they are used improperly, the losses to the country will be even greater!"
    "As for how to save it, there's nothing to it," Wei Qingyu said, pulling a soapstone pencil from under his hat and gesturing, "It's just paying attention when drawing lines, trying not to use large materials for small purposes, superior materials for inferior purposes, and adopting the methods of nesting and material shape marking."
    Someone came to find Wei Qingyu and took him away, saying that the production section was looking for him.
    As soon as Wei Qingyu left, the young man who had been listening to us speak became active. He said to me with a smile, "Do you want to understand Master Wei's affairs? Instead of looking for him, you might as well look for me. Master Wei is strange, if you want to understand his model deeds, he never talks about them. Master Wei is always thinking about saving for the country. He often says to us: 'Our country has little steel now, and needs a lot, not a bit can be wasted in vain.' What he says and what he does are the same. Once, he accepted a task for the No. platform beam. The materials sent from the material warehouse were all brand new I-beams. Master Wei inquired and found out that the platform beam wasn't a remarkable job, and could be done with old materials or semi-finished materials, so he went to find the foreman. The foreman agreed with his opinion, but was afraid that the spliced beams would not be smooth. Master Wei said: 'As long as it saves steel, if it's not smooth, we can take a little trouble and grind it with a grinding wheel.' In this way, the batch of work that should have used thirty tons of good I-beams actually only used five tons. Afterwards, he returned the twenty-five tons of good I-beams, and also scared Lao Li, who manages the warehouse, thinking he had sent the wrong material."
    "Speaking of using old materials and semi-finished materials, Master Wei has really put in a lot of effort," the young man said, looking at the door, probably worried that Wei Qingyu would come back and interrupt him, "He takes a tape measure and walks around the field when he has time, knowing exactly what semi-finished materials and old materials are available in the material warehouse and all parts of the factory, how many there are, and what sizes... When it's time to use them, he can just go and get them. Once, for the No. blast furnace's retaining ring special plate, Master Wei wanted to use semi-finished materials and asked me to get them. I inquired at the material warehouse, and the old man who guarded the warehouse said there weren't any. I went in and looked for a long time, but couldn't find them. When I came back and told Master Wei, he said: 'What, there aren't any? I clearly remember there being a pile at the east end of the warehouse!' I had no choice but to go to the material warehouse again. Sure enough, that pile of semi-finished materials was enough for us to use."
    "In order to eliminate errors and avoid waste, Master Wei is extremely careful when he works. In the winter of the year before last, he accepted a task of numbering materials for a blast furnace. One morning, he was looking at the drawings while shaking his head. At that time, Ai Fuying, who was working with him, became impatient, thinking: 'Master Wei is really something, looking at a drawing for so long.' At this critical moment, Master Wei called him: 'Ai Fuying, come and see, this job requires such a narrow numbering, but the material is so wide, if we cut the material like this, won't every one of these steel plates waste a quarter?' Ai Fuying pulled out a tape measure and measured, and the design did have a problem. Master Wei immediately went to find the production section, and the production section went to find the design institute. Finally, the design was revised according to Master Wei's opinion, saving a full fifty tons of steel plates. This incident was a great education for Ai Fuying. Afterwards, he said to us: 'As careful as Master Wei is, there won't be any waste!'"
    Perhaps he was too moved, the young man's cheeks were flushed, he spoke faster and faster, and his tone was even more cheerful. He was about to continue, when a middle-aged man numbering materials with a white paintbrush straightened up and said loudly, "You haven't said that Master Wei consistently completes the plan ahead of schedule and guarantees the quality of the project. I think that's where the country saves the most."
    "Yes, you're right." The young man continued, "Master Wei's spirit of studying technology diligently is unmatched. He entered the factory a year earlier than me, and passed the technician exam last winter, but I'm still a fourth-grade worker!... When technology improves, the brain becomes more flexible. He researched a nesting method the year before last, and another material shape numbering method last year."
    "Master Wei's role in driving everyone to save steel is really too great!" The middle-aged man who was numbering materials next to him interjected again, "That was probably in the autumn of last year, Master Wei accepted a task of numbering baseplates. When he saw it, he thought that this job could be done with old materials, so he led his apprentice Xiao Ma to the scrap iron pile to pick up old materials. There are many small steel plates in the scrap iron pile, but they are all pressed underneath, and it is very difficult to rummage through them. When Xiao Ma saw it, he flinched: 'Master Wei, I think it's better to number with new materials!' Master Wei said: 'There are so many old materials, why use new materials?' Xiao Ma said with a sad face: 'Look how much trouble it takes to rummage through them!' 'Trouble?' Master Wei smiled, 'A little trouble is good for the country!' 'What's so good about that?' 'What? What's so good about that? You should know that a ton of good steel is worth five hundred yuan, and a ton of old steel sells for no more than one hundred yuan. That is to say, if we use a ton more of old steel plate, we can save the country three or four hundred yuan. Think about it, how much can you save at home to be worth that much money?... Picking up a ton of old materials, the value looks small individually, but it becomes big when put together. Do you remember reading a manuscript in the newspaper: A worker in a match factory in Guanli shortened the match sticks by a few points. This saving may seem insignificant individually, but it is said that if all match factories in the country do this, they can save several million yuan a year. Do you think this saving is small or big?' As soon as Xiao Ma heard this, he became energized and, covered in sweat, rummaged out all the old steel plates with Master Wei. That batch of work didn't use any good materials at all!"…
    An hour later, I said goodbye and came out. Wei Qingyu told me: "From personal experience, I deeply feel that as long as a person pays attention to saving at all times, they can save every day; on the contrary, if you are extravagant, you may cause waste to the country every day. This year, I want to further ensure that every inch of steel is used in a useful place, and save the country another hundred tons of steel from here, while guaranteeing quality!"
    I silently wished him success. (Originally published in Liaoning Daily)

    节约钢材的能手	崔诚五
    清晨，我冒着寒风几次去问鞍山金属结构制造厂加工车间的工人，都说魏庆余还没有来。“奇怪，这个几年来一直提前半小时到一小时上班的人，今天怎么破例了呢？”我怀着困惑的心情，又一次走出了车间。
    远处忽然传来一阵钢铁的冲击声。我顺着声音望去，车间东北角有两个人在翻腾着什么。从他们的背影，我认出一个是魏庆余。
    在他知道我想和他谈谈几年来节约钢材的情况之后，他谦虚地说：“那有什么可谈的！”说着，他和他的伙伴们把翻腾得横七竖八的旧钢材归弄起来，转身领我进了车间。
    我们穿过安装着各种新式机械的车间，跨过一个个奇形怪状的钢材堆，来到一个宽敞的场地。“来，我们就在这儿谈吧，这就是我们的工作场所。”
    我一时没有说话，却想起几个月以前，在鞍山先进生产者会议上，大家就热情地谈论着魏庆余的节约钢材的事迹，讲述着魏庆余爱护国家财产的高贵品质。我满以为魏庆余的工作现场是复杂的。谁知道这里竟连一台最简单的机器也没有，所有的，只是地上的一堆堆钢材，几条长长的标尺，几支白刷笔和滑石笔。真是在极平凡的岗位创造了不平凡的事迹呵！
      “我们这行工作很简单！”魏庆余好像看透了我的心思，“生产科发下图纸，我们照样在钢材上划划道就行了！……工作虽说简单，可是不能说它不重要。我们是全厂的第一道工序，也是决定节约或浪费钢材的最重要的一道工序。正因为这样，我们都非常热爱自己的工作，并且努力把它做好！”
    一个小伙子轻轻地走进来听着魏庆余说话，他像要说句什么，但不知为什么又没有开口。
      “节约钢材，是的，这几年我是节约了二百多吨钢材。”魏庆余接着说，“可是这有什么可说的呢，这只不过是做了工人起码应该做的一点事情罢了。一吨钢材来路有多么不易呀！从矿石到铁到钢到钢材，不知要花费多少人的血和汗。我们要是不把它使用得非常合理，不光要造成很大浪费，也是对别人的劳动不尊重。……我们使的钢材，来路就更不易，有好多钢材都是国外进口的，要是使用不当，给国家造成的损失就更大了！”
    “至于怎样节约的，这也没有什么，”说着，魏庆余从帽子底下抽出一根滑石笔，比划着，“只不过是划线时注点意，尽量不大材小用、优材劣用，和采用一下套号和按料形号的办法罢了。”
    来了一个人把魏庆余找走了，说是生产科找他。
    魏庆余一走，原先听我们说话的小伙子就活跃起来了。他笑哈哈地对我说：“你要了解魏师傅的事吗？你找他，倒不如找我。魏师傅可怪啦，你要了解他的模范事迹，他从来不说。魏师傅时时刻刻都想给国家节约。他常对我们说：‘我们国家现在钢铁少，需要的多，一点也不能白白浪费。’他说的和做的一样。有一次，他接受了一项号平台梁的任务。材料库发来的材料，一色是崭新的工字钢。魏师傅一打听，平台梁并不是个了不起的活，用旧料、半成材做也可以，便马上去找工长。工长很同意他的意见，可是怕接起来的梁不光滑。魏师傅说：‘只要节省钢材，不光滑可以费点事用砂轮打一打。’就这样，那批活本来应该用三十吨好工字钢，实际只用了五吨。事后，他把那二十五吨好工字钢退了回去，还把管仓库的老李吓了一跳，以为自己发错了料呢。”
    “提起利用旧材料和半成材，魏师傅可真花了不少脑筋。”小伙子说着，望了望门口，大概是担心魏庆余回来打断他的话吧，“他有空就拿着卷尺满场转，把材料库和全厂各个地方有些什么半成材和旧料，有多少，尺寸多大……都记得一清二楚的。要用的时候，一去就可以拿来。有一次号高炉的托圈异板，魏师傅要用半成材，叫我去领。我到材料库一打听，看库的老头说没有，我进去找了半天，也没找到。回来和魏师傅一讲，他说：‘怎么，没有？我清清楚楚记得仓库东头有一堆吗！’我没有办法，只好再到材料库去看。可不是怎的，那一堆半成材足够我们使用的。”
    “为了消灭差错，避免浪费，魏师傅干起活来是再细心不过啦。前年冬天，他接受了一座高炉的号料任务。一天早晨，他一边看图，一边晃脑袋。那时和他一块干活的艾富英等得不耐烦了，心想：‘魏师傅可真是，一张图纸也看这半天。’正在这节骨眼，魏师傅招呼他：‘艾富英，你来看看，这个活要号这样窄，料却那样宽，要是这样下料，这些钢板不是每一张都要浪费四分之一吗？’艾富英拉开卷尺一量，设计确实有毛病。魏师傅马上去找生产科，生产科又找设计院，最后按魏师傅的意见修改了设计，整整节约了五十多吨钢板。这件事给艾富英的教育可太大啦。事后他对我们说：‘像魏师傅那样细心，没个浪费！’”。
    也许是太受感动了吧，小伙子脸颊绯红，话越说越快，声调也更爽朗了。他正要往下说，在一旁拿着白刷笔号料的一个中年人直起腰来，高声说道：“你还没有说魏师傅一贯提前完成计划，保证工程质量呢。我看哪，这给国家节约的才多呢。”
    “对，你说的很对。”小伙子往下讲道，“魏师傅刻苦学习技术的精神也是没比的。他比我早进厂一年，去年冬季已经考上技术员，可我还是个四级工！……技术提高啦，脑瓜也就活了。他在前年研究了一种套号的办法，去年又研究了一种按料形号的办法。”
    “魏师傅在带动大家节约钢材方面起的作用可真太大啦！”旁边那位号料的中年人又插了进来，“那大概是去年秋天的事儿吧，魏师傅接受了一项号垫板的任务。他一看，这个活可以用旧料做，就领徒工小马到废铁堆去捡旧料。废铁堆里小块钢板是很多的，可是都压在底下，翻腾起来很困难。小马一看就打怯了：‘魏师傅，我看还是用新料号算啦！’魏师傅说：‘有这么多的旧料，为什么还用新料号呢？’小马哭丧着脸说：‘你看翻腾起来多费事呀！’‘费事？’魏师傅笑了笑，‘费点事对国家可有好处啊！’‘这点好处算得什么？’‘怎么？这点好处？你要知道，一吨好钢材值五百元，一吨旧钢材最多不过卖一百元。这就是说，我们多用一吨旧钢板，就能给国家省三、四百元。你想想看，你在家里省多少东西能值这么多的钱呢？……捡一吨旧材料，单个看来价值很小，凑到一块儿可就大啦。你记得报纸上登过这样一篇稿子不：关里有个火柴厂的工人把火柴杆缩短了几分。这项节约单个看起来恐怕是再小不过了，可是据说全国所有火柴厂都这样做，一年就可以节约好几百万元。你说这项节约是小还是大？’小马一听劲可就上来了，披着汗珠和魏师傅一起把旧钢板都翻了出来。那批活一点也没有用好材料！”…………
    一个钟头以后，我告辞出来。魏庆余告诉我：“从亲身体验里，我深深感到：一个人只要时刻注意节约，每天都能节约；相反，要是你大手大脚的，就可能每天都给国家造成浪费。今年，我要在保证质量的条件下，进一步做到使每一寸钢材都用到有用的地方去，从这里边再给国家节约钢材一百吨！”
    我默默地预祝他成功。　　　　　　（原载辽宁日报）
