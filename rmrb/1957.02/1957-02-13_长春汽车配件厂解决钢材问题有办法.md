Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The state-owned Changchun Automobile Parts Factory, through convening a conference of worker representatives, has found a way to solve the problem of steel shortages, enabling the factory to approximately double its production of automobile parts.

    This factory has accepted orders this year to produce automobile parts for the First Automobile Works. However, the steel allocated to them by the state this year can only meet one-half of their annual production tasks; furthermore, among the more than one hundred types of steel they need, twenty-two types still need to be imported from abroad. In order to overcome the steel shortage, this factory, since mid-January, has been mobilizing workers to find solutions to the steel difficulties by convening worker representative conferences and various professional meetings. The Supply and Marketing Section has already transferred the most experienced procurement personnel to the material procurement group, actively seeking out stagnant materials from various regions, and also sending people to the automobile factory and other related factories to purchase scrap and offcuts. Within the factory, engineers Yu Tiande, Sun Enli, and Zhang Shide, after research and analysis, proposed using 25-gauge galvanized sheet to replace imported cold-rolled sheet, and using medium carbon steel to replace low carbon steel, which could solve the material needs for producing air filter cores in the first half of the year. They have also researched and developed the use of high-quality bakelite powder to produce more than ten types of product parts, such as "choke" pull knobs and "instrument light" housings, which were previously made of steel plates and zinc alloy plates. In the past, the tool workshop used high-speed steel for making molds, but now they are experimenting with using high-speed steel only on the cutting edges of the molds, with the remaining 80% replaced by low-carbon steel, while maintaining the same hardness as before. This one item alone can save more than ten tons of high-quality steel this year. Due to the successful trial production of automobile parts using substitutes, many parts that had been suspended due to raw material difficulties can now be produced in large quantities in February. Currently, this factory has mobilized workers to research and experiment with more than eighty measures to save steel.

    长春汽车配件厂解决钢材问题有办法
    据新华社讯　地方国营长春汽车配件厂，通过召开职工代表大会找到了解决钢材不足的办法，使这个厂的汽车配件的产量可以提高一倍左右。
    这个工厂今年接受了为第一汽车厂生产汽车配件的订货。但是今年国家分配给他们的钢材，只能满足全年生产任务的二分之一；而且所需要的一百多种规格钢材中，有二十二种还需要从国外进口。为了克服钢材不足的困难，这个工厂从1月中旬以来，通过召开职工代表大会和各种专业会议，发动职工寻找解决钢材困难的办法。供销科已经把最有经验的采购人员调到材料采购小组，积极从各地寻找呆滞材料，同时派人去汽车厂等有关厂收购边料和角料。在厂内，工程师于天德、孙恩礼和张师德等人经过研究分析，提出用二十五号镀锌板代替进口的冷轧板，用中炭钢代替低炭钢，可以解决上半年生产空气滤心器所需要的材料。他们还研究出用优质胶木粉来生产过去用钢板、锌合金板生产的“风油门”拉钮和“仪表灯”外壳等十多种产品零件。工具车间过去做模具都用高速钢，现在试验只在模具刃口上用高速钢，其余80％都用低炭钢代替，硬度仍和原来一样。仅这一项今年就能节省十多吨优质钢。由于利用代用品试制汽车零件获得成功，使不少因原材料困难停产已久的部件，又能在2月份大批生产了。现在，这个工厂发动职工研究试验出八十多项节约钢材的措施。
