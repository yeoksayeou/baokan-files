    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Lujiakou Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, which was formed from sixteen remote and scattered mountain villages, has changed its unreasonable labor organization forms during the rectification of the cooperative, based on local natural conditions and the needs of production development.
    The Victory Agricultural Cooperative has a total of 123 member households, distributed in mountain gullies spanning over fifty li. Many mountain villages have only three to five households, and three villages have only one household. After the cooperative was established in January last year, it disregarded the distance between various mountain villages and the scattered residence of the members, uniformly forming nine production teams and implementing a single system of collective labor and unified distribution. This greatly affected the cooperative's annual production and internal unity. The nine households in Lu Laifu's production team were scattered in three mountain villages, but were forced to work on the same piece of land. The result of "much running around, little work done" meant that the actual labor days of members far from the land were half as many as those near the land. Members distributed in small mountain villages had to travel long distances to participate in collective production, so the farmland near their mountain villages was cultivated extensively, resulting in significant production decreases.
    This time, during the rectification of the Victory Agricultural Cooperative, with the help of a work group sent by the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, this problem was solved. Now, the cooperative has adopted four flexible forms of labor organization: in addition to establishing three production teams in three larger mountain villages (each with twenty to thirty households), four smaller mountain villages (each with four to six households) have formed production groups; three small mountain villages with two to three or three to four households have implemented a method of assessing work points, production investment, and output based on cultivated land, and contracting land to households. In order to stimulate the production enthusiasm of the members, the cooperative has implemented methods of assessing work points, investment, and output, and awarding bonuses for exceeding quotas for all three types of production units: teams, groups, and households. In addition, it was decided to adopt the method of honorary membership for three "isolated households" such as Guo Jifu and others. All the land, draught animals, and farm tools they brought into the cooperative were returned to them, encouraging them to engage in independent operation in production, and assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses. They can freely participate in cooperative member meetings, exchange experience in increasing production, and enjoy collectively run shared farm implements and cultural welfare undertakings, only needing to pay annual public welfare funds equal to the average public accumulation fund of the cooperative members. The cooperative also guarantees to provide them with manpower and financial assistance for difficulties in agricultural technology and production.
    The cooperative has also formulated a unified ten-year long-term basic construction plan for building the mountainous area. After the plan is realized, the total grain output of the cooperative will increase from 260,000 jin to 320,000 jin, and the income from forestry and local specialties will increase by 13,000 yuan. Honorary members engaged in independent operation also participate in public basic construction such as afforestation and soil and water conservation, and enjoy the benefits of these basic constructions. At that time, the existing sixteen mountain villages will gradually be merged into four natural villages, and the current honorary members can become formal members.

### 根据社员居住情况灵活地组织劳动

    根据社员居住情况灵活地组织劳动
    据新华社讯　由十六个偏僻、分散的山庄建成的山西省平顺县路家口乡胜利农业社，根据当地自然条件和发展生产的需要，在整社中改变了不合理的劳动组织形式。
    胜利农业社全社一百二十三户社员，分布在方圆五十多里的山沟里。许多山庄只有三、五户，还有三个庄子都只一户。去年1月间这个社建成后，却不顾各个山庄的远近和社员居住的分散情况，统一编制了九个生产队，实行单一的集体劳动、统一分配的办法。这使社里全年生产和内部的团结受到很大的影响。路来富生产队的九户社员分散在三个山庄，却要强求在同一块耕地做活。“跑路不少，做活不多”的结果，使许多距离耕地远的社员实际劳动日比距离耕地近的社员少一半。分布在小山庄的社员，因为远道参加集体生产，他们山庄附近的耕地却耕作粗放，减产很多。
    这次胜利农业社在整社当中，得到中共长治地委派来的一个工作组的帮助，解决了这个问题。现在，这个社已经采取四种灵活的劳动组织形式：除三个较大的山庄（每个山庄二十到三十户）建立三个生产队以外，四个较小的山庄（每个山庄四到六户）分别组成生产小组；三个两户到三、四户的小山庄实行按耕地评定工数、生产投资和产量，以及以户包地的办法。为了激发社员的生产积极性，社里对生产队、小组、户三种生产单位，都实行了评定工数、投资、产量和超额奖励的办法。另外，对郭积福等三户“孤庄独户”的社员确定采用名誉社员的办法。全部退还他们原来入社带进的土地、耕畜和农具，勉励他们生产上单独经营，收益自负盈亏。他们可以自由参加社员大会，交流增产经验，享受集体举办的共有农具和文化福利事业，每年只需要交纳等于社员平均公积金数的公益金。社里还保证对他们在农业技术和生产上的困难给予人力、财力上的援助。
    这个社对建设山区还是制订了统一的十年长期基本建设规划。规划实现后，全社粮食总产量将由二十六万斤增加到三十二万斤，林业、土特产的收入将增加一万三千元。单独经营的名誉社员也参加植树造林、水土保持等公共基本建设，并且享受这些基本建设的效益。那时，现有的十六个山庄将逐步并为四个自然村，现在的名誉社员就可以成为正式社员了。
