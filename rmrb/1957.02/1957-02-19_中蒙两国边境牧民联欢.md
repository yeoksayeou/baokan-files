Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, February 18th. Mongolian herdsmen living near the northern border of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region invited herdsmen from the Mongolian People's Republic who are wintering and springing on the Chinese grasslands to celebrate the Lantern Festival together on February 14th in Taidar Temple, Darhan Muminggan United Banner.

    That morning, the male and female guests rode horses to the venue, where they were warmly welcomed by Zhaoligtu, Secretary of the CPC Darhan Muminggan United Banner Committee, Banner Head Gu’erzabu, and local herdsmen. The herdsmen prepared warm yurts for the guests and entertained them with whole sheep and fruit wine, the traditional Mongolian way of treating distinguished guests.

    Gu’erzabu, Banner Head of Darhan Muminggan United Banner, delivered a welcome speech. Then, Young Pioneers presented flowers to the guests and gave them gifts. Danjin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Eighth Bag of Harden Baolikesumu, Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, said at the meeting with great emotion: The friendship between the people of China and Mongolia is close. During our "Aoter" (nomadic migration) in China this time, this eternal friendship has been further developed. He presented our herdsmen with a banner inscribed with "Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Mongolian People."

    At the get-together, Chinese and Mongolian herdsmen drank wine and chatted cordially, hand in hand, singing ancient Mongolian folk songs in their common language. The herdsmen also exchanged grazing experiences at the meeting. In order to jointly overcome the severe cold, wind, and snow disasters, and to ensure that all livestock safely winter and spring, Inner Mongolian herdsmen agreed to give part of the lush pasture to the guests and help solve the difficulty of fuel shortage. Veterinarians from the Mongolian People's Republic also agreed to treat the livestock of local Chinese herdsmen.

    The gathering lasted from morning until sunset, when the herdsmen of the two countries reluctantly parted.
