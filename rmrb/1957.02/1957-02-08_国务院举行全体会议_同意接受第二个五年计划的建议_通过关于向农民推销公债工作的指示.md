Xinhua News Agency, 7th - The 42nd plenary meeting of the State Council was held on the morning of the 7th. Today's plenary meeting discussed the proposal submitted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the State Council regarding the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) for the Development of the National Economy from the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The meeting unanimously agreed to accept this proposal and instructed the State Planning Commission to work with all ministries, commissions, State Council offices, and the people's committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to promptly draft the Second Five-Year Plan and submit it to the State Council for review before submitting it to the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision.

The meeting then discussed and approved the State Council's instructions on promoting the sale of the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds to farmers. These instructions pointed out that, based on the now basically completed agricultural cooperativization, the sale of public bonds to farmers in 1957 should change the previous method of individual farmers subscribing and paying separately to a method where agricultural cooperatives organize farmers to subscribe and pay on behalf of them, with the consent of the members. Individual farmers can purchase public bonds themselves or entrust agricultural cooperatives to handle it on their behalf.

The meeting also discussed the issue of improving school education.

Finally, the meeting approved personnel appointments and removals.

    新华社7日讯　国务院全体会议第四十二次会议在7日上午举行。今天的全体会议，讨论了中国共产党中央委员会提交国务院的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划（1958年—1962年）的建议。会议一致同意接受这个建议，并且责成国家计划委员会根据这个建议会同各部、各委员会、国务院各办公室和各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会迅速编制第二个五年计划草案，报经国务院审查后，提请全国人民代表大会审议决定。
    会议接着讨论通过了国务院关于向农民推销1957年国家经济建设公债工作的指示。这个指示中指出，根据农业合作化已经基本完成的情况，1957年对农民推销公债，应当把过去由个体农户分别认购分别缴款的办法，改为由农业社组织农户，在社员同意的原则下，进行认购并由农业社代为缴款的办法。个体农户购买公债，可以自己办理，也可以委托农业社代为办理。
    会议还讨论了关于改进学校教育工作的问题。
