Xinhua News Agency, 19th. In the past month or so, more than 260 units in Beijing have voluntarily returned 9,000 tons of coal saved to the Beijing State-owned Coal Industry Building Materials Company.

Despite the particularly cold weather in Beijing recently, many government agencies and enterprises have still found ways to save a large amount of coal. The Municipal Coal Construction Company recently checked and reduced the coal consumption plans of more than 1,300 units in accordance with the regulations of the State Council, so the state can supply more than 30,000 tons of coal less. Many units have reduced their coal consumption by 30% to 40% by improving coal burning methods and strict management. After the reduction, most units do not affect heating needs. The Fanjia Hutong office building of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee used to burn more than 12 tons of coal every day for heating boilers. After strict control, the heating supply was stopped in the corridors and infrequently used conference rooms, and the excessive temperature in the offices was also appropriately reduced. At the same time, the coal burning method was improved, so the daily coal consumption was reduced to more than six tons. The Ministry of Forestry Industry originally had five heating boilers. After research, it was found that three were enough. As a result, the daily coal consumption was reduced from nine and a half tons to more than six tons. Although the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine needs a higher temperature according to the work situation, everyone still actively tried to reduce the indoor temperature from 21 degrees Celsius to 18 degrees Celsius without affecting the work, so that the daily coal consumption dropped from eight tons to six tons.

The Municipal Coal Supply Joint Office is currently organizing various units to exchange experiences in saving coal in different districts.

### 北京二百多个单位  节约煤炭九千吨

    北京二百多个单位
    节约煤炭九千吨
    新华社19日讯　一个多月来，北京市已有二百六十多个单位自动把节省下的九千吨煤炭退给北京市国营煤业建筑器材公司。
    尽管北京市近来的气候特别寒冷，许多机关、企业仍然想办法节省了大批煤炭。市煤建公司最近按照国务院的规定，检查核减了一千三百多个单位的用煤计划，国家因此就可以少供应三万多吨煤。有不少单位，由于改进烧煤方法，严格管理，用煤量都缩减了30％到40％。大部单位核减后，并不影响供暖需要。北京市人民委员会范家胡同办公大楼，过去每天烧暖气锅炉，用煤都在十二吨以上，经过严格控制，走廊和不常使用的会议室停止了供气，办公室的过高温度也适当降低，同时，改进烧煤方法，因此每天用煤量减少到六吨多。森林工业部原有五台暖气锅炉，经过研究，烧三台就够用了，结果，每天烧煤由九吨半减少到六吨多。中医研究院虽然根据工作情况，需要温度较高，但大家仍积极想办法，在不影响工作的前提下把室内温度从摄氏二十一度降到十八度，使每天用煤从八吨下降到六吨。
    市煤炭供应联合办公室目前正在分区广泛地组织各单位交流节约煤炭的经验。
