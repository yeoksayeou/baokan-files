    Ice Sailing on the Songhua River	Meng Liang
    The Songhua River, long renowned for its beauty, possesses an even more alluring charm in winter. The riverbanks are already draped in silvery white, and the frozen river surface resembles a gleaming ribbon of mercury. The biting cold wind constantly sweeps across the river, and the outdoor temperature in Harbin often drops to below minus 20 degrees Celsius. However, winter sports on the Songhua River are no less vibrant than in other seasons. Whenever the sun sets and on holidays, swift ice sails frequently shuttle across this beautiful and tranquil river surface.
    The shape of an ice sail resembles an airplane. Three ice blades, each about three feet long, support an isosceles triangular wooden board. A mast stands upright on the board, with a sailcloth that is wide at the bottom and pointed at the top hanging from it. A rudder is installed at the apex of the triangular wooden board. Ice sails glide entirely by wind power. The stronger the wind, the faster they glide. In winds of force four or five, they can travel at over ninety kilometers per hour, faster than a car.
    Ice sailing is a unique winter sport in Northeast China and a new sports item in our country. It is said that in the past, there was only one ice sail in Harbin, and it was driven by a Soviet person. Since the Workers' Club of the Harbin Federation of Trade Unions manufactured ice sails last year, this sport has begun to develop.
    Ice sailing is an extremely interesting sport. It not only glides fast but can also cross ice humps. When gliding, the ice blades make a "swishing" sound, and the snow on the river splashes in all directions, like a sailboat breaking waves in the ocean. There are also sharp turns and quick stops during gliding.
    This interesting sport has attracted many young men and women. The Harbin River Sports Station receives hundreds of ice sailing athletes every day. Most of them are young workers and staff members. After a period of training, many have become proficient in operating ice sails. Wang Guiying, a 21-year-old fitter from the Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory, has been training for less than two winters and has now become the only female helmsman in ice sailing.

### 松花江上的冰帆

    松花江上的冰帆	孟良
    素来被誉为美丽的松花江，冬天更有一种诱人的景色。江畔早已披上了银白色的衣衫，封冻的江面像一条闪光的水银带。江面上不时袭来刺骨的寒风，哈尔滨室外的温度经常下降到摄氏零下二十多度。然而，冬天松花江上的运动并不比其他季节逊色。每当夕阳西下和假日的时候，在这美丽而平静的江面上时常穿梭着疾行如飞的冰帆。
    冰帆的形状好像飞机。三个三尺来长的冰刀托着一块等腰三角形的木板，上面树立着一个桅杆，桅杆上悬挂着一块上尖底宽的帆布，在三角木板的顶角安装着一个舵。冰帆滑行的时候完全借助风力。风越大滑行得越快，在四、五级的风力下，每小时可滑行九十多公里，比汽车还要快。
    冰帆是东北地区冬天特有的一种运动项目，也是我国新的体育项目。据说过去哈尔滨只有一架，还是由苏联人驾驶。自从去年哈尔滨市工会联合会工人俱乐部制造了冰帆以后，这项运动才开展起来。
    冰帆是一项极有趣的运动，它不仅滑行得快，而且能越过冰丘。在滑行的时候冰刀发出“沙沙”的声音，江上的积雪四处飞溅，宛如帆船在海洋里破浪前进，在滑行中也有急转和急停的动作。
    这项有趣的运动吸引了许许多多的青年男女。哈尔滨江上运动站每天接待着上百名的冰帆运动员。他们大多数是青年工人和职员，经过一个时期锻炼以后，已有很多人能熟练地操纵冰帆了。哈尔滨第一工具厂的钳工王桂英，是二十一岁的姑娘，锻炼还不到两个冬天，现在已成了冰帆运动中的唯一女舵手。
