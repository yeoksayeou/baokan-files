    On the Relationship Between the Struggle Between Idealism and Materialism and Class Struggle in the History of Chinese Philosophy	Zhang Hengshou
    Since Marxism was introduced to China, many authors have attempted to explain the emergence and development of various philosophical thoughts in Chinese history using class analysis. Since liberation, even more people have been engaged in this work. Looking back at the path we have traversed over the past two decades, there has indeed been considerable progress. However, generally speaking, most works have not fundamentally transcended the stage of simple analogy with the development of Western philosophy, and have not completely overcome the shortcoming of simply applying class labels to the framework of idealism and materialism. However, this shortcoming, judging from the issues raised in some recently published articles on Chinese philosophy history, has indeed been felt by everyone. The mere raising of this issue marks a significant step forward on this path.
    Comrade Zhu Bokun's paper speaks most clearly about the shortcomings and difficulties of philosophical history work. He said: "According to the general view, idealism always represents the interests of historically reactionary and declining classes, while materialism always represents the interests of historically progressive classes. But this issue is not that simple. Some people once believed that in Chinese feudal society, peasants were the exploited class, so the philosophical viewpoints reflecting the peasants should be materialistic. But this is not actually the case. For example, the revolutionary thinkers of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom believed in God, and it cannot be said that they were materialists in their worldview. For another example, the thoughts of the Taoists in the pre-Qin period, the doctrines of Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu, did not believe in God and ghosts, advocated 'the natural way of heaven,' and opposed teleology, and should be said to be ancient materialists and atheists. But their (especially Zhuangzi's) socio-political views strongly reflected the emotions of the declining aristocracy, and clearly represented the interests of the declining class at that time. Conversely, Mencius expressed many remarks in social politics that were beneficial to the emerging feudal forces at that time, but on the fundamental question of philosophy, he believed in 'the mandate of heaven,' spoke of mysticism, and advocated theocratic politics. How can we explain the relationship between these historical facts and the laws of philosophical development? If these problems are just exceptions, but there are too many such exceptions in history, then the principle becomes problematic. … Some people say that a history of ancient Chinese philosophy, the thoughts in it, again and again, either represent the big landlords or the small landlords, and there is actually no class analysis. These problems are not just about how to analyze specific materials, but also involve certain theoretical issues related to historical materialism." (See People's Daily, October 14, 1956)
    Whether these issues involve certain theoretical issues related to historical materialism remains to be considered. However, these phenomena indeed prove that we have not conducted sufficient concrete analysis of specific situations. I feel that not only is the social change in the pre-Qin era, as Comrade Zhu Bokun mentioned, complex, and the ideological content of Lao, Zhuang, Mencius, and Xunzi is complex, making it difficult to explain with simple methods, but even the society and philosophy after the Qin and Han dynasties, which we think are relatively simple and clear, are not so easy to deal with.
    For example, the opposition between the theory of interaction between heaven and man, represented by Dong Zhongshu, and the naturalism represented by Wang Chong in Han Dynasty philosophy, this distinction is very clear. But it is not so easy to conclude that one represents the interests of the reactionary class and the other represents the interests of the peasant class or the progressive class. From the perspective of worldview or the explanation of nature, we all know that Dong Zhongshu's theory of interaction between heaven and man is unscientific, superstitious, and can be said to be theological and religious. There will be no dispute on this point. But from the standpoint of social struggle, or from the standpoint of social issues, it is difficult for us to say that Dong Zhongshu was a reactionary.
    We know that the biggest social problem in the Han Dynasty was the land problem of the peasants. The attitude towards this problem can reveal the different positions of different figures. And Dong Zhongshu was the first to raise the land problem. On this issue, he not only stood in opposition to the powerful landlords of the time, but also took a step further than Jia Yi and Chao Cuo, the political commentators whom we generally consider to have progressive ideas. Jia Yi and Chao Cuo only proposed policies to support centralized power and emphasize agriculture and suppress commerce, while Dong Zhongshu formally proposed the specific proposition of "limiting the people's named fields to support the insufficient." Everyone knows that the famous saying "the rich own fields connecting thousands of acres, while the poor have no place to stand" was said by him; the famous saying "abolish slavery, eliminate the power of arbitrary killing" was said by him; he used indignant tones to condemn the harsh and heavy taxes of the autocratic emperors; and used sympathetic attitudes to describe the poor small people who "wear the clothes of cattle and horses and eat the food of dogs and pigs"; he expressed incomparable resentment towards those powerful people who "increase their cattle and sheep and increase their slaves"; and called out sympathetic voices to those tenant farmers who "till the fields of powerful people and pay taxes of fifteen percent." If Dong Zhongshu's language were written in poetic form, I don't think it would be any less popular than the works of the great poets Du Fu and Bai Juyi. But when we talk about the history of philosophy and the history of thought, we can only, according to our formula, describe him as a completely reactionary priest. When it comes to the land problem in the Han Dynasty, Dong Zhongshu can only be regarded as a broadcaster, using his mouth to convey the land problem, the slave problem, and the proposals to solve the land problem and the "slave problem" in the Han Dynasty. It seems that Dong Zhongshu's language has nothing to do with his thoughts, feelings, positions, and viewpoints. This cannot but be said to be a very difficult "contradiction" to understand. These phenomena should make us reconsider the simple application of principles. Some authors of philosophical history and thought history have also made some efforts to justify themselves on this contradiction. Their methods are probably nothing more than saying that Dong Zhongshu represents the ruling class and can only propose the idea of limiting fields, but does not dare to propose the idea of equalizing fields, which is the consciousness of the landlord class. Or simply say that Dong Zhongshu, like Wang Mang, is just a liar who speaks for the emperor. If the demand for land reform had become a universal call in the era in which Dong Zhongshu lived; or if Dong Zhongshu was a trusted minister and relative of the emperor, then it would not be an untryable explanation to say that he used his power to deceive the masses, or echoed others and imitated them. But everyone knows that no one had raised this issue before Dong Zhongshu; Dong Zhongshu himself was not a powerful minister or relative, but a neglected person excluded by the court, and his proposal of these propositions was not welcomed by the ruling class. In short, neither from the time and position he was in, was there the possibility or necessity to use the land problem to deceive the masses. Therefore, the above explanation, in addition to proving people's desire to conform to the idea that "the idealist worldview must serve the reactionary ruling class," has not made further progress in solving the complex relationship of specific facts.
    The thinker who opposed Dong Zhongshu's school was Wang Chong. In the era when the ideas of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements dominated everything, Wang Chong relentlessly attacked the then-popular theories of disasters and anomalies, the theories of identification and latitude, and all the superstitious claims of Yin and Yang. He was indeed a great naturalist. But, is this just as some authors say, that Wang Chong represents the interests of the peasant class? This is a question worth considering. Although Wang Chong's books on politics have not been handed down, judging from the existing eighty-five articles of Lunheng, among them, Xuanguan and other three articles can be said to be articles praising the Han Dynasty's rule. In his "Minglu Pian," he said, "There is a life and death, longevity and early death, and there is also a fate of nobility, baseness, poverty, and wealth"; he believed that the rise and fall, peace and danger of the country are entirely determined by the fate of the country, and have nothing to do with human efforts. "Zhiqi Pian" says: "The governance and chaos of the world lies in the time, not in politics; the safety and danger of the country lies in number, not in education." This theory can never play any progressive role in social struggle, and it is even more difficult to say that it is the consciousness of the peasant class. If it must be said that it represents the peasants, then it can only be said that it represents the pessimistic mood after the failure of the peasant uprising. But judging from the entire book of Lunheng, there are very few languages that appeal for the peasants. Therefore, this assumption is difficult to establish. We have heard the language of the peasants themselves in history, they said: "The blue sky is dead, the yellow sky should stand; the year is Jiazi, the world is auspicious." This true cry of peasant resistance is inconsistent with Wang Chong's thought.
    Here, let me talk about Fan Zhen of the Southern Dynasty. We know that the second outstanding materialist in the history of Chinese philosophy besides Wang Chong was Fan Zhen, who lived during the Qi and Liang periods. Not only is his theory of the destruction of the soul a valuable legacy in the history of Chinese philosophy, but also his spirit of daring to put forward different propositions from the emperor is an excellent tradition worth promoting. But, can it be said that Fan Zhen's theory represents the interests of the peasant class? Of course not. Although the content of the theory of the destruction of the soul mainly answers the theory of the relationship between form and spirit, it also mentions his social ideals in the end. What is his social ideal? It is "villains are content with their fields, and gentlemen protect their tranquility," "the lower have surplus to serve the upper, and the upper do nothing to wait for the lower." He not only did not see the peasant problem and the land problem in the Southern Dynasty; but also did not express sympathy for the peasants. This ideal of "villains are content with their fields" is consistent with his theory of chance, which says, "The birth of man is like a flower on a tree, blooming on the same branch, blooming on the same stem, falling with the wind, naturally falling on the curtain and falling on the carpet, naturally closing the fence wall and falling on the side of the dung."
    But according to our "theoretical formula," we can only define Dong Zhongshu as representing the interests of the reactionary big landlord class, while Wang Chong and Fan Zhen represent the interests of the peasant class. It seems that in our work on the history of philosophy, when deciding which class a person belongs to, or which class's interests they represent, the method we adopt is completely different from the method we adopt in actual movements (such as in ideological reform movements) to determine which class a person belongs to, or which class's thoughts they represent. In actual movements, when determining a person's class position, it mainly depends on his actual actions and propositions on actual issues, while in philosophy, when determining a person's class position, it is enough to look at his explanation of the world. This cannot but be said to be a manifestation of metaphysical methods, not an application of materialist dialectics.
    In addition to the difficulty in explaining Dong Zhongshu's philosophy and his class position, the second problem that arises is the issue of the evaluation of Zhu Xi.
    We know that Zhu Xi advocated "reason is before qi" in cosmology. This idealistic system is what we oppose. Zhu Xi's commentaries on the classics and his ethical norms were also educational tools advocated by later emperors, and they also played a reactionary role in feudal society. But if we simply infer that he is a reactionary figure based on his cosmology and the respect of later emperors for him, then we will encounter contradictions between theory and actual struggle.
    We know that after the mid-Tang Dynasty, the most serious social problem was the problem of equalizing land tax. On the struggle of this issue, one's position can be seen. And Zhu Xi was a person who firmly advocated the implementation of the policy of surveying land and equalizing labor service to fight against the powerful landlords, and was an executor who had extremely detailed plans for surveying land. It was precisely because Zhu Xi firmly implemented the policy of surveying land and firmly opposed corrupt officials who were related to the prime minister that he offended powerful ministers, which finally led to the "Qingyuan Party Ban" that comprehensively attacked him. During the period when the party ban was implemented, not only was Zhu Xi himself excluded and almost put to death; but all his students were implicated. Even before entering the official career, people had to write and fill out a voluntary letter, guaranteeing that they were not members of Zhu Xi's party, before they could join the official system. Just as Mr. Lu Xun said that Confucius was an unlucky person who ran into obstacles everywhere during his lifetime, Zhu Xi was also a persecuted and unlucky person during his lifetime. However, when we talk about the history of philosophy and the history of thought, in order to conform to our simple formula, we can completely ignore the actual struggle of a philosopher, or use a sentence about the internal contradictions of the ruling class to cover up complex facts. Using this method, the problem is indeed simplified, and the theory is indeed easy to explain, but a concrete analysis of the connection between the real philosophical struggle and the class struggle has not been made.
    We mentioned the examples of Dong Zhongshu and Zhu Xi, not to show that idealism has "some advantages," and to give "comrades who have had feelings for idealism" a little comfort, but to provide some specific situations to remind us to make some concrete analysis of these specific situations, and not to simply solve complex problems with a simple formula.
    We not only believe that the theory of idealism is incorrect, but also do not want to emphasize the point that "idealism has played a progressive role under certain historical conditions"; what we want to emphasize is that there were indeed some people in history who were idealists in cosmology, but they stood on the side of opposing the ruling class in actual struggle; their social theories were in favor of reform and opposed conservatism. We should delve into: What is the relationship between their cosmology and their actual struggles? From what logic do they derive the conclusion of reforming society from the idealistic cosmology? What is the relationship and contradiction between the principles that guide them to establish their ideals and the actual observations that truly guide them to establish their social theories? As a weapon of struggle, what positive and negative effects have these theories played?
    We say that Wang Chong and Fan Zhen do not represent the peasant class, which of course does not conflict with our saying that materialism is ultimately the correct proposition. Because before Marxism, there was no most comprehensive scientific materialism in history that included both dialectical materialism and historical materialism. A philosopher with a materialist worldview in ancient history cannot guarantee that his explanation of social history is also correct. On the contrary, it can be said that before the emergence of scientific materialism, a naturalist in cosmology was often easily a determinist in social view; a determinist in social view was certainly not an active social reformer, so simply inferring that they represent the interests of the peasant class from materialism in worldview is not in line with the principles of historical materialism.
    According to my personal immature ideas, I think that in the future, when applying the class analysis method, we should not directly draw the conclusion that a philosopher represents the reactionary class or the progressive class simply based on whether his worldview or cosmology is idealistic or materialistic. We should change the order of analysis, first examine which side a philosopher stands on in social struggle and political struggle; and examine whether his historical theory and social theory are progressive or reactionary. If a philosopher only has theories about the universe; and no propositions about society, if there are no defects in the documents, then we should examine whether he is a scholar who is indifferent to society. If a philosopher: (1) is materialistic in worldview and progressive in social struggle; (2) or is a mechanical materialist in worldview and passive in social struggle; (3) or is religious and idealistic in worldview and reactionary and conservative in social struggle; for these three types of philosophy, our explanation work is of course not difficult. If a philosopher's worldview is idealistic, but he is active in social struggle and social theory, then we should examine whether his cosmology is the guiding principle of his social theory, and through what tortuous path he arrives at conclusions in social issues.
    I believe that the relationship between a person's class interests and his social struggle social theory is direct; and the relationship with his worldview is indirect. Logically speaking, a person's social view and historical view are derived from his worldview; but in fact, a person's worldview is often constructed according to his social view. Especially before natural science became an absolutely universally recognized truth in society, the worldview of ancient thinkers often served their social view, rather than their social view serving their worldview. Therefore, when we determine the class position of a historical philosopher, we should take his social theory as the main focus and his worldview as the auxiliary; we should determine his class position from his social struggle and social theory, and then seek the relationship between the two. We should not first infer his class position from his cosmology, and then try to explain the social actions and political propositions that do not conform to this "inference."
    This is my first opinion on how to specifically apply the class analysis method.
    In addition to the above first simple formula, the second simple formula in the research work of Chinese philosophy history is: "All philosophies that are orthodox and advocated by emperors must be reactionary; all philosophies that belong to 'heresy' must be progressive and revolutionary." The widespread application of this formula has also hindered our concrete understanding of the development of Chinese philosophy.
    To overcome this shortcoming, we must first distinguish between the ideological theories created by a thinker and the ideological theories used by the ruling class to promote them, so as to clarify the clues of ideological struggle and political struggle. Otherwise, we will not easily get out of the dead end of simple formulas.
    We know that no matter what kind of ruling class, it must have a set of theories to rule the people in order to consolidate its ruling position. And the more the ruling is not consolidated, the more it is necessary to find some new theories as tools to maintain people's hearts. In history, the most convenient and beneficial way for rulers is to take the theories that already have influence in society and slightly change their focus, so that they can become the best weapons to deceive the people. Therefore, in history, some ideas that originally had considerable progressive significance and desire for reform have become the ruling tools of the reactionary class. This is why a thinker who has authority in society is a persecuted person during his lifetime, and becomes a worshiped idol after his death. Such examples seem to be easy to find in the history of both the East and the West. And Zhu Xi, whom we mentioned earlier, actually belongs to such a tragic figure.
    This phenomenon has already been seen by historians in the feudal era. Zhang Pu, who led the student movement in the Ming Dynasty, made such a judgment on the relationship between the rulers of the Song Dynasty and the Cheng-Zhu school: He said: "Zhu Xi is a scholar of the Cheng brothers. When Han Tuozhou was in power, he did not dare to criticize Cheng's scholarship but imprisoned Zhu Xi. Zhen Dexiu and Wei Liaoweng are scholars of Zhu Xi. When Shi Miyuan was in power, he already knew to respect Zhu's scholarship, but imprisoned Zhen and Wei. Cheng's scholarship became clear in the Southern Crossing, and if he wanted to imprison Zhu and criticize Cheng, he was afraid that heresy would not be extended; Zhu's scholarship became clear in Lizong, and if he wanted to imprison Zhen and Wei and criticize Zhu, he was afraid that the ruler would not believe it. Therefore, Cheng's scholarship was not abolished, but Zhu Xi was degraded; Zhu's scholarship was more respected, but Zhen and Wei were dismissed. This is what is called the thief's way of the villain also has its way. … When they see the books of the sages, they like them, but when they are in the bodies of the sages, they abandon them; after the sages die, they admire them, but before the sages are alive, they imprison them. The same ills have occurred in ancient and modern times, and even more so in enlightened rulers." (See Song Shi Ji Shi Ben Mo, Volume 59, "Zhen Wei and Other Virtuous People Were Dismissed" Appendix)
    Zhang Pu believed that the phenomenon of "Cheng's scholarship was not abolished but Zhu Xi was degraded, Zhu's scholarship was more respected but Zhen and Wei were dismissed" was "the villain's way of the thief also has its way," which can be said to be a correct and sharp criticism. We must have more acute eyes than Zhang Pu, and use the Marxist-Leninist class analysis method to specifically analyze the respect for Cheng and Zhu after the Southern Song Dynasty and the original desires of the Cheng-Zhu school, so as to explain the connection and distinction between them; and to find out the explanation of the emergence and transformation of the theory from the actual problem. If we follow our current method, not only can we not explain the relationship between Zhu Xi's scholarship and Zhu Xi's actions, but even the origin of the outstanding thinkers of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, which we often publicize, becomes a problem that cannot be explained.
    It should be pointed out that the ruler's use and distortion of the theories of thinkers has not stopped even after the emergence of the proletarian revolutionary theory. Lenin said in "State and Revolution":
    "During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly persecuted them, treated their doctrines with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred, and the most unrestrained slander. After their death, attempts are made to turn them into harmless idols, to, so to speak, canonize them, to surround their names with a certain halo for the 'consolation' and deception of the oppressed classes, while emasculating the content of the revolutionary doctrine, blunting its revolutionary edge, and vulgarizing it."
    Lenin's instruction can indeed be used as a key to deal with complex problems in the history of philosophy. Because Marxism is the most difficult doctrine to use, and in fact it will still encounter distortions, then it is only natural that some doctrines with only reform significance in the feudal era are easily used by the rulers. Therefore, the important work in our research on the history of philosophy, in addition to conducting a detailed analysis of the philosophy itself, is to find out the contradictions and unity between political use and the doctrine itself, and to find out the key to how a doctrine with a certain degree of progressiveness transforms into a reactionary nature, so as to explain the specific development of philosophical thought and avoid the contradictions of accommodating the formula.
    The above is my second opinion on what I thought of when changing the research method.
    I imagine that if we can change this simplified method of analysis, and can find the connection and contradiction between the philosopher's worldview and social view through the philosopher's actual actions and actual propositions, then the philosophical history or philosophical history teaching work we write will not be an isolated and fragmented introduction and explanation of searching for materialist materials from ancient documents, but will become a work that tells the close connection between social development and ideological development. (Of course, in the process of work, analyzing the philosophical thoughts of ancient philosophers is still the most important key, because if the ideological content of philosophers is not clearly distinguished, then there is no way to find the class division of philosophers.) At the same time, if we can explain philosophical ideas through practical problems, then we can not only solve the problems of the history of philosophy, but also help solve the problems of the history of Chinese society. Because the key to the current debate on the periodization of Chinese social history is not whether there is a certain economic system (such as slave economy or feudal economy) in a certain era, but in a certain era, there are several economic systems at the same time, but the key is which economic system occupies a dominant position. The key to solving the economic system lies in distinguishing the modes of production, which is only the responsibility of social historians; and the key to solving which system occupies a dominant position, that is, solving the problem of "social form," lies not only in the distinction of social basis, but also needs to study the face of the entire superstructure. Therefore, if we can explain philosophy, one of the superstructures, we will definitely be able to turn back and help solve the problem of which economic system occupies a dominant position. In this way, philosophical historians will not always be in the "servant" position of following social historians to transfer the foundation, but will become friends who collaborate with social historians to solve all problems.
    Occupy as much material as possible, deeply analyze the content of thought, creatively use the class analysis method, and work hard on the research of Chinese philosophy history, which is the task that we should jointly undertake.

    关于中国哲学史中唯心唯物斗争和阶级斗争的关系问题	张恒寿
    自从马克思主义传播到中国以来，便有不少作者，企图用阶级分析的方法，解释中国历史上各种哲学思想的产生和发展。解放以来，有了更多的人从事这方面的工作。现在回顾一下二十多年来走过的路程，确已有相当程度的进展。但是总的说来，大部分论著，基本上还没有超出简单比附西方哲学发展的阶段，还没有完全克服在唯心唯物的框子上，贴阶级标签的缺点。不过这一缺点，从最近报刊上发表的有关中国哲学史问题的一些论文中所提到的问题看来，确曾被大家感觉到了。仅仅这个问题的提出，就标志着在这一路程上已大大前进一步了。
    朱伯昆同志的论文，对于哲学史工作的缺点和困难，说得最为明白。他说：“按照一般的说法，唯心主义总是代表历史上反动和没落阶级的利益，而唯物主义总是代表历史上进步的阶级的利益。但这个问题，也不是那末简单。有人曾经认为在中国的封建社会中，农民是被剥削的阶级，因此反映农民的哲学观点，应该是唯物主义的。但实际上并不然。例如，太平天国的革命思想家，相信上帝，总不能说他们在世界观上是唯物主义者。又如，先秦道家的思想，老子、庄子的学说，不相信上帝和鬼神，提倡“天道自然”，反对目的论，应该说是古代的唯物主义者和无神论者。但他们（尤其是庄子）的社会政治观点，却强烈地反映了没落贵族的情绪，显然是代表当时没落阶级的利益。与此相反，孟子在社会政治上发表了许多有利于当时新兴封建势力的言论，但他在哲学基本问题上却信“天命”，讲神秘主义，主张神权政治。怎样说明这些历史事实和哲学发展规律的关系呢？如果说，这些问题只是例外，但历史上这种例外太多了，原则也就成问题了。……有人说，一部中国古代哲学史，其中的思想，说来说去，不是代表大地主，就是代表小地主，实际上没有什么阶级分析。这些问题，不仅仅是对具体材料如何分析的问题，同时也牵涉到有关历史唯物主义的某些理论问题。”（见1956年10月14日人民日报）
    究竟这些问题，是不是牵涉到有关历史唯物主义的某些理论问题，还需要另作考虑。不过这些现象，确实证明了我们对于具体情况没有进行足够的具体分析。我觉得不仅像朱伯昆同志所提出的先秦时代，社会变化的复杂，老、庄、孟、荀思想内容的复杂，用简单的方法不容易解释，就连我们认为秦汉以后的社会和哲学似乎比较简单明确，也不是那么容易处理的。
    比如汉代哲学中以董仲舒为代表的天人感应说，和以王充为代表的自然主义的对立，这个分野是很分明的。但从而认为一个是代表反动阶级利益的，一个是代表农民阶级或进步阶级利益的就不是那么容易了。从世界观或对自然的解释上看，我们都知道董仲舒所讲的天人感应论，是非科学的，迷信的，可以说是神学的宗教的。在这一点上，不会有什么争论。但是从社会斗争的立场上，或从社会问题的主张上看，我们很难说董仲舒是一个反动人物。
    我们知道，汉代最大的社会问题，是农民的土地问题，对于这一问题的态度上，可以看出不同人物的不同立场来。而董仲舒正是第一个把土地问题提出来的人。在这个问题的立场上，他不但和当时的豪强地主立于反对的地位，而且比我们一般认为有进步思想的政论家贾谊、晁错，都更前进一步。贾谊、晁错不过提出了拥护中央集权和重农抑商的政策，而董仲舒则正式提出了“限民名田以赡不足”的具体主张。谁都知道“富者田连阡陌，贫者无立锥之地”的名言，是他说出来的；“去奴婢，除专杀之威”的名言是他说出来的；他曾用了愤激的口吻，谴责了专制皇帝的苛重赋役；用了同情的态度，描写了“衣牛马之衣而食犬彘之食”的贫困小民；对那些“众其牛羊多其奴婢”的豪民，表示了无比的愤恨；对那些“或耕豪民之田见税什五”的佃农，叫出了同情的呼声。假如把董仲舒的语言，用诗歌形式写出来，我想不会比大诗人杜甫、白居易的作品的人民性更为少些。但是我们讲哲学史、思想史时，却只能依照我们的公式，把他说成是一个反动透顶的神父。讲到汉代土地问题时，都只能把董仲舒当作一个广播员，借他的口把汉代的土地问题、奴隶问题和解决土地问题、“奴隶问题的主张传达出来。仿佛董仲舒的语言和他的思想感情，立场观点，毫无关系。这不能不说是一个很难理解的”矛盾。这些现象，应该使我们对于原则的简单运用，要重作一番考虑了。我们一些哲学史、思想史的作者，在这一矛盾上，也曾作过一番自圆其说的努力。他们的方法，大概不外说董仲舒代表统治阶级，只能提出限田的主张，还不敢提出均田的主张来，这是地主阶级的意识。或者干脆说董仲舒和王莽一样，不过是一个代表皇帝立言的骗子。如果董仲舒所处的时代，土地改革的要求已成为普遍的呼声；或者董仲舒是一个皇帝信任的大臣贵戚，那么说他假借权势，欺骗群众，或者，随声附和，依样学舌，那还不失为一个可以尝试的解说。但是谁都知道，在董仲舒以前，还没有人提出这个问题；董仲舒本人，并不是权臣贵戚，而是被朝廷排斥的冷落人员，他提出这些主张，并不为统治阶级所欢迎。总之，不论从他处的时际和地位上说，都没有利用土地问题欺骗群众的可能和必要。所以上面的解释，除了证明人们企图附会于“唯心论的宇宙观，一定为反动统治阶级服务”的愿望以外，对于具体事实的复杂关系，并没有作出进一步的解决。
    和董仲舒派相对立的思想家是王充。王充在阴阳五行思想统治一切的时代，对于当时流行的灾异说、识纬说，及一切阴阳迷信的说法，加以无情的攻击。他确实是一个伟大的自然主义者。但是，这是不是就如一些作者所说，王充是代表农民阶级利益的呢？这就是一个值得考虑的问题。王充讲政治的书，虽没有流传下来，但就现存的八十五篇论衡看来，其中宣汉等三篇，可以说是给汉朝统治颂扬的文章。他在“命禄篇”中说：“有死生寿夭之命，亦有贵贱贫富之命”；认为国家的兴衰安危，完全由国命决定，与人类的努力，毫无关系。“治期篇”中说：“世之治乱，在时不在政；国之安危，在数不在教”。这种理论，决不能在社会斗争上起什么进步作用，更不容易说成是农民阶级的意识。如果一定要说是代表农民，那只能说是代表农民起义失败后的悲观情绪。但从论衡全书中看来，很少替农民呼吁的语言。因此这个假定很难成立。我们在历史上曾经听到过农民自己的语言，他们说：“苍天已死，黄天当立；岁在甲子，天下大吉”。这种农民反抗的真正呼声，和王充的思想是不一致的。
    在这里顺便谈一下南朝的范缜。我们知道中国哲学史上，王充以外第二个杰出的唯物主义者，是齐梁之际的范缜。不但他的神灭论是中国哲学史上宝贵遗产，而且他敢于提出和皇帝不同主张的精神，也是一个值得提倡的优良传统。但是，能不能说范缜的理论是代表农民阶级的利益的呢？当然是不能的。神灭论的内容，虽然主要是解答形神关系的理论，而最后也提到了他的社会理想。他的社会理想是什么呢？是“小人甘其陇亩、君子保其恬素”，“下有余以奉其上，上无为以待其下”。他不但没有看见南朝的农民问题和土地问题；而且也没有表示出对于农民的同情。这种“小人甘其陇亩”的理想，正和他说“人之生，譬如一树花，同发一枝，俱开一蒂，随风而堕，自有拂帘幌坠于茵席之上，自有关篱墙落于溷粪之侧”的偶然论，是一致的。
    但是依照我们的那个“理论公式”，却只能把董仲舒定为代表反动的大地主阶级利益，而王充和范缜是代表农民阶级利益的。仿佛我们在哲学史研究工作中，决定一个人是属于什么阶级，或代表什么阶级的利益时，和我们在实际运动中（比如在思想改造运动中）决定一个人是属于什么阶级，或代表什么阶级思想时所采用的方法，可以完全不同。在实际运动中，决定一个人的阶级立场时，主要是取决于他的实际行动和对实际问题的主张，而在哲学上决定一个人的阶级立场时，只用看一下他对于世界的解释就够了。这不能不说是形而上学方法的表现，而不是唯物辩证法的应用。
    除了董仲舒哲学和他的阶级立场难于解说外，第二个发生困难的问题，是关于朱熹的评价问题。
    我们知道：朱熹在宇宙论上，主张“理在气先”。这种唯心论的体系是我们所反对的。朱熹的经书注解及其伦理规范，又曾是后代帝王提倡的教育工具，在封建社会中也是起了反动作用的。但是如果单单根据了他的宇宙论和后代帝王对于他的尊重，就推定他是一个反动人物，便又会遇到理论和实际斗争中间的矛盾。
    我们知道，中唐以后，最严重的社会问题，是土地赋税的平均问题。就在这一问题的斗争上，可以看出一个人的立场来。而朱熹正是一个坚决主张执行方田均役向豪强地主斗争的人，并且是一个有极详密的进行方田规划的实行者。朱熹就因为坚决执行方田政策，坚决反对和宰相有亲戚关系的贪官污吏，得罪了权贵大臣，终于兴起了对他全面打击的“庆元党禁”。在党禁实行时期，不但朱熹本人被排斥，几至置于死地；而且所有他的学生，都受了牵连。甚至于人们在入仕之前，必须先写填甘结，保证不是朱熹党徒，才能加入官吏系统。正如鲁迅先生说孔子生前是一个到处碰钉的倒霉人物一样，朱熹生前也是一个被迫害的倒霉人物。然而我们讲哲学史、思想史时，为了符合于我们的简单公式，竟可以对于一个哲学家的实际斗争，毫不理睬，或者用一句统治阶级内部矛盾的话，掩盖了复杂的事实。采用这种办法，问题确实是简单化了，理论确实容易讲了，但对于真正哲学斗争和阶级斗争的联系，并没有作出具体的分析。
    我们提到了董仲舒和朱熹的例证，并不想说明唯心主义是“有些好处的”，借此给“对唯心主义有过感情的同志们”一点安慰，而是想提供一些具体情况，提醒我们对这些具体情况，作一些具体分析，不要仅仅用一个简单公式，就算解决了复杂的问题。
    我们不但认为唯心主义的理论是不正确的，而且也不想强调“唯心主义在一定历史条件下起过进步作用”的那一论点；我们想着重说明的是：历史上确曾有些在宇宙论上是唯心主义的人，他们在实际斗争上是站在反对统治阶级立场上的；他们的社会理论，是主张改革、反对保守的。我们应该深入研究一下：他们的宇宙论和他们的实际斗争中间有些什么关系？他们从什么逻辑出发，由唯心的宇宙论上，推出改革社会的结论来？指导他们建立理想的原理，和真正指导他们建立社会理论的实际观察，两者中间的关系和矛盾是什么？作为一个斗争武器来说，这些理论，起过什么正面和反面的作用？
    我们说王充和范缜，不代表农民阶级，当然和我们说唯物主义最后是正确的主张，并不冲突。因为在马克思主义以前，历史上根本没有既包含辩证唯物主义又包含历史唯物主义的最全面的科学唯物主义。一个古代史中有唯物世界观的哲学家，并不能保证他对社会历史的解释也是正确的。反而可以说在科学唯物主义产生以前一个宇宙论上的自然主义者，往往在社会观上容易是一个命定论者；一个社会观上的命定论者，当然不是一个积极的社会改革者，所以仅仅从世界观上的唯物主义，推到代表农民阶级利益的方法，是和唯物史观的原理不符合的。
    照我个人不成熟的想法，认为今后应用阶级分析法时，应该对于一个哲学家，不要只是根据他的世界观或宇宙论是唯心主义呢还是唯物主义而直接得到他是代表反动阶级还是代表进步阶级的结论。应该改换一下分析的次序，首先考察一个哲学家在社会斗争和政治斗争中的立场，是站在那一方面的；考察一下他的历史理论社会理论是进步的还是反动的。如果一个哲学家，只有关于宇宙方面的理论；而没有社会方面的主张，假如不是文献上有缺陷，就应该考察他是否是一个对社会漠不关心的学者。如果一个哲学家：（一）在世界观上是唯物的、在社会斗争上是进步的；（二）或者在世界观上是机械唯物主义的，在社会斗争上是消极的；（三）或者在世界观上是宗教的唯心的，在社会斗争上是反动的保守的；对于这三种类型的哲学，我们的解释工作当然没有什么困难。如果一个哲学家的世界观是唯心的，而在社会斗争社会理论上是积极的，那就应该考察他的宇宙论是不是他的社会论的指导原理，他经过怎样的曲折路径，得出在社会问题方面的结论。
    我以为一个人的阶级利益，和他的社会斗争社会理论的关系是直接的；和他的世界观是间接的。从逻辑上说，一个人的社会观、历史观是从世界观上推出来的；但从实际上说，一个人的世界观却往往是根据他的社会观构成的。特别是在自然科学没有成为社会上绝对普遍承认的真理以前，古代思想家的世界观，往往是为他的社会观服务，而不是他的社会观给他的世界观服务。因此我们决定一个历史上的哲学家的阶级立场时，应该以他的社会理论为主，以他的世界观为辅；应该从他的社会斗争社会理论上确定他的阶级立场，从而寻求两者间的关系。不应该先从他的宇宙论上推论他的阶级立场，然后再设法解释和这个“推论”不符合的社会行动和政治主张。
    这是我对于如何具体应用阶级分析方法的第一点意见。
    除了上述第一个简单公式外，中国哲学史研究工作中的第二个简单公式是：“凡是正统的经过帝王提倡的哲学，一定是反动的；凡是属于‘异端’的哲学，一定是进步的，革命的。”这一个公式的普遍应用，也阻碍了我们对中国哲学发展的具体了解。
    要想克服这个缺点，首先应该把一个思想家所创造的思想理论，和统治阶级所利用来提倡的思想理论区别开来，才能弄清楚思想斗争和政治斗争的线索。否则我们不容易走出简单公式的死胡同。
    我们知道：不论是什么样的统治阶级，必须有一套统治人民的理论，才能巩固他的统治地位。而且越到统治不巩固的时期，越需要找寻一些新的理论作为其维系人心的工具。历史上，对于统治者最方便最有利的办法，莫过于把社会上已具有势力的理论拿来，稍为改变一下它的重点，便可以成为欺骗人民的最好武器。因此历史上若干本来具有相当进步意义和改良愿望的思想，变成了反动阶级的统治工具。这便是为什么一个社会上具有权威的思想家，在他生前是一个被迫害的人物，到他死后，便成为被崇拜的偶像的原因。这种例子，在东西方的历史上，似乎都不难找到。而我们前面所提到朱熹，实际上也属于这样悲剧性的人物。
    这种现象，在封建时代的历史家们，也已经看出来了。领导过明代学生运动的张溥，对于宋代统治者和程朱学派的关系，曾做过这样的论断：他说：“为二程之学者，朱熹也。韩佗胄当国，不敢斥程学而偏锢朱熹。为朱熹之学者，真（德秀）魏（了翁）也。史弥运当国，既知尊朱学，而偏锢真魏。程学明于南渡，欲锢熹而斥程，则恐邪说之不伸；朱学明于理宗，欲锢真魏而斥熹，则恐人主之不信。是故程学不废而朱熹自贬；朱学加崇而真魏自罢。此所谓小人之术盗亦有道也。……见圣贤之书则好之，当圣贤之身则弃之；圣贤既死则慕之，圣贤生前则锢之。古今同弊，于明君尤甚焉。”（见宋史记事本末卷五十九，“真魏诸贤用罢”附论）
    张溥对于“程学不废而朱学自贬，朱学加崇而真魏自罢”的现象，认为是“小人之术盗亦有道”，这可以说是既正确而又尖锐的批评。我们必须具有比张溥更为明锐的眼光，用马克思列宁主义的阶级分析法，对南宋以后对于程朱的尊崇，和程朱学说的本来愿望，加以具体分析，才能说明他们中间的联系和区别；才能从实际问题中找出理论的产生和转变的说明。如果照我们现在的办法，则不但不能说明解决朱熹学说和朱熹行动间的关系，就连我们经常宣扬的明清之际的卓越思想家的来源，也成为无法说明的问题了。
    应该指出：统治者对于思想家的学说加以利用、曲解，即使到了无产阶级革命学说发生以后，也没有停止过。列宁在“国家与革命”上说：
    “当伟大革命家在生时，压迫阶级总是用不断的追究来酬答他们，总是以最野蛮的恶意，最疯狂的仇恨，最放肆的造谣中伤来对待其学说。当他们逝世以后，便企图把他们变为无害的神像，可说是把他们偶像化，给他们的名字赋予某种荣誉，以便‘安慰’并愚弄被压迫阶级，同时却阉割革命学说的内容，磨灭其革命锋芒，而使之庸俗化。”
    列宁这一指示，确可以作为处理哲学史上复杂问题的锁钥。因为马克思主义是最不容易利用的学说，而事实上还要遇到曲解，那么封建时代一些仅有改良意义的学说，它容易被统治者利用，那该是最自然不过的事了。所以我们哲学史研究中的重要工作，除了对于哲学本身，进行详密的分析外，就是要从政治利用和学说本身中找出其间的矛盾和统一，找出一个有一定进步性的学说如何转变为反动性质的关键，才能说明哲学思想的具体发展，才能避免迁就公式的矛盾。
    以上是我对于改变研究方法时所想到的第二点意见。
    我设想如果我们能改变了这个简单化的分析法，能够通过哲学家的实际行动和实际主张，找寻哲学家的世界观和社会观中间的联系和矛盾，那时，我们所写的哲学史或哲学史的教学工作，就不会是一个孤立的零碎的从古代文献中搜寻唯物主义材料的介绍和解释工作，而会成为一种讲述社会发展和思想发展密切联系的工作。（当然在工作进行中，分析古代哲学家的哲学思想，仍然是最主要的关键，因为如果对于哲学家的思想内容分别不清，那么对于哲学家的阶级分野也就无从找寻了。）同时如果能通过实际问题说明哲学思想，那时不但可以解决哲学史的问题，而且可以帮助解决中国社会史的问题。因为现在关于中国社会史分期争论的关键，不在于某一时代有没有某一经济体系（如奴隶经济或封建经济），而在于某一时代，同时有几种经济体系，可是究竟是哪一种经济体系占支配地位的问题。解决经济体系的关键，在于区别生产方式，这只是社会史家的责任；而解决哪种体系占支配地位，也即是解决“社会形态”问题的关键，就不仅是在于社会基础的区别，而也需要研究整个上层建筑的面貌。因此我们如果能对于上层建筑之一的哲学，有所说明，一定能反转来对于解决何种经济体系占主导地位的问题有所帮助。这样，哲学史家，就不致永远处于跟随社会史家转移基础的“仆从”地位，而会成为协同社会史家解决全部问题的朋友了。
    尽量占有大量的材料，深入分析思想的内容，有创造性地运用阶级分析方法，努力从事于中国哲学史的研究，这是我们应该共同担负起来的任务。
