    Syrian School Education	Chairman of the Education Committee of the Syrian Ministry of Education, Wodiya Huli
    Syria is a country that gained independence after World War II. During the era of colonial rule, the people lived in poverty and had few opportunities for education. School education was extremely underdeveloped. Only after Syria's independence in 1945, with the strong advocacy of the Syrian government, did school education in Syria experience significant development. The general policy of Syrian school education is to correctly cultivate a healthy new generation, making each citizen physically strong, morally excellent, ideologically healthy, patriotic, and nationalistic; to make them conscientious in their work, possess the knowledge needed for life, and be able to serve the country.
    Syrian primary education is free and compulsory. The duration of study is five years. In 1945, when the last French soldier withdrew from Syrian soil, there were only 946 primary schools with 28,550 students. But by 1955, ten years after independence, there were 2,636 primary schools with 336,221 students. The number of schools increased nearly threefold, and the number of students increased more than elevenfold compared to before independence.
    During the imperialist rule, although primary education was legally compulsory, it was limited to cities and some large villages; moreover, the primary education regulations were only suitable for cities and not applicable to rural areas. Children in primary schools were taught French, and teachers used pictures depicting French urban life for teaching. After 1945, we focused on common sense, history, and geography as the key points of patriotic education. We developed a primary education system that meets the needs of Syrian villages. For nomadic peoples, the government is working to settle them down in order to provide school education. Syria has made considerable efforts in this regard. We have newly established a Rural Education Department, which is specifically responsible for developing rural education.
    Syrian secondary education is also free, with a study period of seven years. Secondary education includes general middle schools, secondary technical schools, and co-educational normal schools for training primary school teachers.
    In 1945, there were only 64 middle schools in Syria with 11,592 students. In 1955, ten years after independence, we had 244 middle schools with 60,666 students.
    We have conducted much research on secondary education curricula, especially on courses such as Arabic language, history, geography, and philosophy. We have added a subject on Arab society to strengthen ideological education on nationalism.
    Secondary school students should learn a foreign language. Currently, they can choose to study English or French. This year, we are starting to prepare teachers to add German, Russian, and Spanish. We may also add Italian. Students can choose freely.
    As for vocational and technical school education, there are still difficult problems. Due to our lack of experience in technical teaching, after independence, we had to rely on industrial technology teachers sent by Egypt. We also relied on some experts sent by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, but they received high salaries and proposed some irresponsible methods. Four years have passed, and all the experiments conducted according to these experts' reports have completely failed because these methods do not conform to Syria's actual situation.
    Now, we have thirteen industrial and commercial secondary technical schools with 2,190 students. These schools have the necessary experimental equipment. To prepare teachers for these schools, the government has sent students to advanced engineering colleges in Western countries for further study. However, most of them have not yet completed their studies, and those who have returned after completing their studies have been assigned by the state to the most needed positions.
    Now we have signed cultural agreements with some countries and have begun to send students to these countries for further study. In the days before our delegation left Damascus for China, we sent fifteen students to the German Democratic Republic, eight students to Czechoslovakia, three to Bulgaria, and two to the Soviet Union. Twenty-four of the above students are studying engineering and heavy industry. In addition, we have completed the work of sending one hundred and twenty students to European countries, especially Italy, Germany, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, to study industry, engineering, or other relatively advanced sciences.
    If we include the 633 students in agricultural schools and veterinary schools led by the Ministry of Agriculture in the number of technical school students, then there are 2,823 students. But this is only equal to 4.4% of the total number of secondary school students, which should be increased to 55% to meet the needs of the country.
    Therefore, the Syrian constitution pays special attention to the development of technical schools. Thanks to the technical assistance of friendly people's democratic countries, we have every hope of achieving this goal.
    The training of school teachers is an important issue. In 1945, Syria had only four normal schools for training primary school teachers, with a total of 284 students. Now we have eight co-educational normal schools with a total of 1,271 students. Among these normal schools, there are secondary normal schools for training general primary school teachers and rural normal schools for training rural primary school teachers.
    The issue of middle school teachers is completely different from that of primary school teachers. When the French imperialists withdrew, Syria did not have an institution for training middle school teachers. Therefore, while developing secondary education, we added some new departments to the University of Syria. We relied on the help of existing active teachers and teachers from brotherly Arab countries such as Egypt and Lebanon, and sent a group of students to Egypt and other countries to study. In just four years, the University of Syria was able to train a group of teachers with advanced professional certificates to support secondary education. Now, we cannot say that the teacher issue has been completely resolved, but it is much better than before.
    The history of university education in Syria is very short.
    In 1945, there were only two colleges in the University of Syria, namely the Medical College and the Law College, with a total of 1,058 students, including 68 female students. Now there are seven colleges: the Medical College, the Law College, the Engineering College, the Science College, the Arts College, the Education College, and the Religious College. Affiliated to the Medical College are the Higher Medical School, the Dental School, and the Obstetrical Nursing School. This year, the Higher School of Commerce will be established. At the same time, the Syrian University Committee also plans to establish an Agricultural College, a Political College, and a Political Economy College.
    The establishment of these colleges is of great significance to Syria. The colonialists vainly attempted to make the Syrian people admit that Arabic is not a practical language. However, now all kinds of sciences in the University of Syria are taught in Arabic. This is entirely due to the professors who participated in the establishment of the new colleges. On the one hand, they worked hard to study the proper nouns used by ancient Arabs to make them conform to scientific use; on the other hand, they created new scientific terms.
    Graduates and professors of the University of Syria have jointly organized many academic organizations to conduct research in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other subjects. These academic organizations cooperate with each other and also with the Arab Academic Association (which is composed of academic organizations from all Arab countries). The Arab Academic Association plays a certain role in exchanging various research results among Arab countries. This association attaches importance to unifying scientific terms in Arab countries and compiling dictionaries of scientific terms in Arabic, English, and French. This work will be completed in 1957.
    In the field of literature and art, we have restored national songs and Arabic music since independence, established the Damascus Oriental Music Academy, converted the Aleppo Conservatory of Music into a national institution, and formed many orchestras under the leadership of the Broadcasting Corporation. After expansion and improvement, the Broadcasting Corporation has reached the level of world radio stations. We have also restored Arabic national dances, especially the famous Samaha dance. Many male and female students participated in the advanced literary and artistic troupe.
    In painting and sculpture, we have sent many outstanding Syrian students to the largest painting and sculpture colleges in Italy, France, and Egypt to study. In order to improve the level of Syrian literary and artistic workers, we have held many literary and artistic competitions, awarded prizes to outstanding works, and encouraged the holding of foreign art exhibitions. Some countries, including the Soviet Union, have held art exhibitions at the Damascus National Museum. We hope that friendly China can exhibit her amazing artworks in Damascus, which would be of great benefit to Syrian artists and would also enable people from all over the world to have the opportunity to appreciate the beautiful art of China.
    The Syrian education authorities attach great importance to sports activities and have specially established a Sports Department.
    These are some of the achievements that the Syrian people have made in culture and education since independence. We believe that this is only a beginning, and there are still many things to be done. (Special Contribution to this Newspaper) (Attached Picture)

    叙利亚的学校教育	叙利亚教育部教育委员会主席　沃地亚·胡利
    叙利亚是在第二次世界大战以后独立的国家。在殖民主义统治时代，人民生活困苦，很少有受教育的机会，学校教育极不发达，在1945年独立以后，在叙利亚政府大力提倡下，叙利亚的学校教育才有了较显著的发展。叙利亚学校教育的总方针，是要正确地培养健全的新的一代，使每个国民成为体魄健壮，品德优良，思想健康，爱国家，有民族感的人；使他们成为对工作认真负责，具备生活所需要的知识，能服务国家的人。
    叙利亚的小学教育是免费的义务教育。学习期限是五年。在1945年最后一个法国士兵撤出叙利亚国土的时候，只有小学校九百四十六所，小学生二万八千五百五十人；但到1955年，即独立以后的十年的时候，共有小学校二千六百三十六所，学生达到三十三万六千二百二十一人，比独立以前学校增加了将近三倍，学生增加了十一倍多。
    在帝国主义统治时期，小学教育虽然按法律规定是强迫教育，但仅限于城市和一些大的乡村；而且小学教育章程只适合于城市，不适用于乡村。小学里教孩子学法文，教员在课堂上用描绘法国城市生活的图片进行教学。1945年以后，我们把常识、历史、地理作为爱国主义教育的重点。我们制定了符合叙利亚乡村需要的小学教育制度。对于游牧民族，政府正在设法使他们定居下来，以便进行学校教育。叙利亚在这方面已作了不少努力，我们新设了农村教育厅，专门负责发展农村教育工作。
    叙利亚的中等教育也是免费的，学习期限七年。中等教育有普通中学、中等技术学校和培养小学师资的男女师范学校。
    1945年，叙利亚全国只有六十四所中学，学生一万一千五百九十二人。在1955年，即独立后十年，我们有二百四十四所中学，有学生六万零六百六十六人。
    对中学教育课程，特别是关于阿拉伯语文、历史、地理、哲学等课程，我们作了许多研究。我们增加了阿拉伯社会一科，以便加强民族主义的思想教育。
    中等学校学生应学习一种外国语。现在他们可选读英语或法语。今年我们开始准备教师，以便增设德文、俄文、西班牙文。也可能增加意大利文。我们也希望增加中文。学生可自由选读。
    至于职业和技术学校教育，目前还存在着困难问题。由于我们缺乏技术教学经验，在独立以后，我们只好依靠埃及派来的工业技术教师。我们也依靠了联合国教育科学文化组织派来的部分专家，但是，他们领取了高额的薪金，提出了一些不负责任的办法。四年的时间过去了，所有按照这些专家的报告而进行的实验完全归于失败。因为这些办法不符合叙利亚的实际情况。
    现在，我们有了十三所工业和商业中等技术学校，学生二千一百九十人。这些学校都有必需的实验设备。为了给这些学校准备师资，政府曾派留学生到西方国家的高等工程学院去深造。但大部分人都还没有完成学习，少部分学成回国的人，国家已分配他们到最需要的岗位上去工作。
    现在我们已同一些国家订立了文化协定，并开始派遣留学生到这些国家去深造。在我们代表团离开大马士革来中国的前几天，曾派了十五名留学生到民主德国，八名留学生到捷克斯洛伐克，三名到保加利亚，二名到苏联。上述留学生中有二十四名是研究工程和重工业的。另外，我们还完成了派遣一百二十名留学生的工作，他们是到欧洲各国，特别是意大利、德国、比利时、捷克斯洛伐克等国去研究工业、工程或其他比较先进的科学的。
    如把农业部领导的农业学校和兽医学校的六百三十三名学生计算在技术学校学生的数字内，那就有学生二千八百二十三人。但这也只等于所有中等学校学生人数的百分之四点四，应提高到百分之五十五才符合国家的需要。
    因此叙利亚宪法特别重视发展技术学校。由于友好的人民民主国家的技术援助，我们完全有希望达到这个目的。
    学校师资的培养是个重要问题。在1945年，叙利亚只有四个培养小学师资的师范学校，共有学生二百八十四名。现在我们有八所男女师范学校，共有学生一千二百七十一人。在这些师范学校中，有培养一般小学师资的中等师范学校，有培养乡村小学师资的乡村师范学校。
    中等学校师资问题和小学师资问题完全不同。在法帝国主义者撤退时，叙利亚还没有培养中学师资的机构。因此，我们在发展中等教育的同时，在叙利亚大学里添设了一些新院系。我们依靠现有的积极工作的教师和阿拉伯兄弟国家如埃及、黎巴嫩的教师的帮助，并派遣了一批学生到埃及和其他国家留学，仅仅花了四年功夫，叙利亚大学就能培养出一批持有高等专业证书的教师支援中等教育。现在还不能说师资问题已彻底解决，但较以前已好得多了。
      叙利亚的大学教育的历史是很短的。
  1945年，叙利亚大学里只有两个学院，即医学院和法学院，共有学生一千零五十八人，其中女生六十八人。现在有七个学院：即医学院、法学院、工学院、科学院、文学院、教育学院和宗教学院。附属医学院的有高等医药学校、牙科学校和产科护士学校。今年将创建高等商业学院，同时叙利亚大学委员会还计划建立农学院、政治学院和政治经济学学院。
    这些学院的创立，对叙利亚有着重要的意义。殖民主义者妄想使叙利亚人民承认阿拉伯文不是实用的文字，可是，现在叙利亚大学里所有各种科学都是用阿拉伯文讲授的，这完全归功于那些参加创立新学院的教授们，他们一方面努力钻研古代阿拉伯人使用过的专有名词，使它们符合于科学的使用；一方面又创造了新的科学专门名词。
    叙利亚大学毕业生和教授们共同组织了许多学术组织，进行数学、物理、化学等科的研究工作。这些学术组织彼此互相合作，也同阿拉伯学术协会（这是所有阿拉伯国家学术组织组成的）进行互助合作。阿拉伯学术协会在阿拉伯各国间交换各种研究成果方面起了一定的作用。这个协会重视统一阿拉伯国家的科学名词，编制阿、英、法三种文字的科学专门名词辞典。这个工作将在1957年间完成。
    在文艺方面，我们在独立以后恢复了民族歌曲和阿拉伯音乐，创办了大马士革东方音乐学院，把阿勒颇市的音乐学院改成国立，并在广播事业局领导下组成了许多乐队。广播事业局在扩建和改善后，已达到世界广播电台的水平。我们还恢复了阿拉伯的民族舞蹈，特别是著名的撒玛哈舞。有许多男女学生参加了高级文艺大队。
    在绘画和雕刻方面，我们派遣了许多优秀的叙利亚学生到意大利、法国、埃及最大的绘画雕刻学院去学习。为了提高叙利亚文艺工作者的水平，我们举办了许多文艺竞赛，给优秀的作品颁发奖品，鼓励举办外国艺术展览。现在已有部分国家，其中有苏联，在大马士革国家博物馆举办了画展。我们希望友好的中国能够把她的惊人的艺术作品在大马士革展览，这对于叙利亚艺术工作者来说，是有很大好处的，同时也可以使世界各国人士能够有机会欣赏中国的优美的艺术。
    叙利亚教育当局很重视体育活动，专门设立了体育司。
    这些就是叙利亚人民独立后在文化教育方面所获得的一部分成就，我们认为这仅仅是个开端，目前还有许多事情需要去作。　（本报特约稿）（附图片）
