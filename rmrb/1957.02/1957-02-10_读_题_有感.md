	Reflections on Reading "Topics"
		Yan Xiu

	In the past year or two, I have had the opportunity to read some research plans and writing plans from universities, Party schools, and scientific institutions – mainly in the fields of philosophy, politics, and economics. While some of these topics are interesting, novel, and appealing, most do not possess these characteristics, making it a significant effort to read them through. Of course, the quality of an article does not depend on its title, so I certainly do not intend to judge these papers based solely on their titles.

	However, if one says that by examining dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of research proposals, one can discern a general trend in research work, that wouldn't be considered entirely subjective, would it?

	In this short essay, I will refrain from citing specific paper titles. Because, over the years, we have dealt with countless papers and pamphlets that fail to raise or solve problems, are filled with empty talk, and are dogmatic. Similarly, a large portion of these research topics are just as mediocre, dull, and dry, many of which discourage readers from even looking at the articles. The philosophy section, in particular, seems especially regrettable, with many attempting to write books or articles on commonplace, parrot-like general principles.

	Learning the basic principles of Marxism is for the sake of applying them, using them to study science, guide our work, and transform the world, not to train us to be mere Marxist porters – moving them from one booklet to another, from one article to another. Basic principles are important, but knowing only this aspect will likely prevent us from accomplishing anything. For example, the basic knowledge of the laws and categories of dialectics are the most general and highest-level principles; they only provide a scientific viewpoint and method for solving a specific problem, but they do not directly solve specific problems for you. Therefore, it seems unnecessary for teaching and research groups, graduate students, and researchers to all write on topics like "What is Necessity?" or "What is Freedom?" (Of course, some people still want to write, and write well). Merely knowing these things will not make one a philosopher, just as merely knowing the definitions of sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks, Cambrian, Ordovician, etc., will not make one a geologist. In essence, many of these kinds of treatises can only be described as works of memorizing definitions and extracting concepts. Clarifying them is very necessary, but it cannot be said that this is the real beginning of scientific research. Engels said something interesting when refuting Dühring: "From a scientific point of view, all definitions have only slight value." (Of course, Engels also stated that clarifying definitions is very necessary). Regarding some of our philosophical and social science research plans, one cannot help but feel the same way.

	Marx, Engels, and Lenin never wrote a general introduction to philosophy, economics, or communism. Their theories were derived from analyzing the history of human society from ancient times to the present, the history of human understanding of nature, and the history of human ideology. Their theories were always integrated into the specific problems they sought to solve. Here's an example. Everyone knows that Engels wrote a long preface for the English edition of his book "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific" in 1892, which was also published separately under the title "On Historical Materialism." In this preface, we find no definition of historical materialism, no enumeration of its rules, or description of its characteristics. Instead, he only described the history of social production development in Europe since the Renaissance, the history of class struggle and reform movements, the history of the development of old materialism and dialectics, the history of religious thought and the workers' movement, and the relationships between them. After understanding these rich contents, you will naturally understand what is meant by the socio-economic base and what is meant by the superstructure. If you understand the history of human society in this way, then you understand "historical materialism." In the past, I did not understand this article; I felt that after reading it, I still didn't know what it was talking about, and I secretly blamed Engels for writing endlessly and going off-topic! Later, I slowly understood a little and felt that explaining historical materialism in this way was much more profound and persuasive than explaining it with clauses.

	By giving this example, I certainly do not mean that everyone must be like Marx and Engels, thoroughly understanding the history of human social production development, the history of natural development, and the history of superstructure development before discussing philosophical or economic theories. Rather, I mean that we should build on the theoretical foundations they have established to open up new research fields, applying their viewpoints and methods to study unresolved or not fully resolved problems in social history, nature, and ideology, instead of merely living off the legacy of Marx and Engels.

	I think if an ideological management organization could collect and study these research plans and thesis plans, and promptly correct some detours, it would be very helpful for the future of our scientific development.

### 读“题”有感

    读“题”有感	严秀
    最近一两年来，我有机会读到一些高等学校、党校和科学机构的研究计划和写作计划——这里主要说哲学、政治、经济这几个部门。其中固然有不少有趣的、新颖的和吸引人的题目，可惜大多数的题目却并不具有这种特点，以至人们要把它们读完，也非下很大的决心不可。当然，文章的好坏，并不决定于题目，因此，我在这里也绝没有想根据这些题目就来否定这些论文的意思。
    但是，如果说，当几十个、几百个以至成千个以上的论文计划摆在你面前的时候，就可以看出一个研究工作的大概趋势来，那总不能说是十分的主观主义吧。
    在这篇短文里，恕我不引用具体的论文名称了。因为，多少年来，我们已经同有一种不提出问题、不解决问题、夸夸其谈和教条主义的论文和小册子打过多少交道了。同样的，这些研究题目中的很大一部分也是那样地平庸、灰色、枯燥，有很多确是叫人看了题目就不想再看文章的东西。特别是哲学的部分，看来是更令人感到遗憾的，好多都是在人云亦云的一般性的原理原则问题上想写出书或者文章来。
    学习马克思主义的基本原理是为了运用，用它们来研究科学、指导工作、改造世界，而不是叫我们练习如何去做马克思主义的搬运工人——把它们从这一本小册子搬到另一本小册子，从这一篇文章搬到另一篇文章。基本原则是很重要的，但仅仅知道这一方面，恐怕什么事情也不能做。例如说，辩证法的几条法则和若干范畴的基本知识，乃是最一般性的最高概括性的原理，它只负责提供你去解决某一特定问题时的科学的观点和方法，但它本身并不替你直接解决各个特定的问题。所以教研组、研究生、研究员一齐都来写“什么叫必然”“什么叫自由”一类的题目，我看是不必要的（当然有的人还是要写，而且要写的好）。仅仅知道这些，决不能成为一个哲学家，正像仅仅知道水成岩、火成岩、寒武纪、奥陶纪等等的名词解释之不能成为一个地质学家一样。这一类性质的论著，就其实质说来，好多都只能说是一种记述定义和摘录概念的工作，弄清楚是非常必要的，但还不能说这就是科学研究工作的真正开始。恩格斯在反驳杜林的时候说过这么两句有趣味的话：“从科学观点看来，一切定义都只有微小的价值。”（当然，恩格斯也同时说明弄清楚定义是很有必要的）。对于我们有些哲学社会科学的研究计划，不免也使人要产生这样的感觉。
    马克思、恩格斯和列宁，他们从来没有写过一本哲学、经济学和共产主义问题的概论。他们的理论是从分析从古到今人类社会的历史，人类认识自然的历史以及人类意识形态的历史之后而得出来的，他们的理论在任何时候都是融合在他们所要解决的具体问题中。这里可以举一个例。大家都知道，恩格斯在1892年为他的“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”一书的英文本作了一篇长序，同时又以“论历史唯物主义”为题单独予以发表，在这篇长序里我们根本找不到历史唯物主义的定义是什么，它有多少条规则，多少个特点等等的叙述。相反的，他只叙述了欧洲自文艺复兴以来社会生产发展的历史，阶级斗争和改革运动的历史，旧的唯物主义和辩证法发展的历史，宗教思想和工人运动的历史，以及它们相互之间的关系等等。你把这些丰富的内容了解之后，你就自然而然地懂得了什么叫做社会经济基础，什么叫做上层建筑。如果你照这样去了解人类社会的历史，那就算懂得了“历史唯物主义”。从前，我是没有读懂这一篇文章的，觉得讲完了还不知道它在讲什么，心中还暗暗地责备恩格斯是下笔千言离题万里呢！后来慢慢的懂得了一点，才感到这样来解释历史唯物主义不知比用条款来解释要深刻多少倍，说服力要强多少倍。
    我举出这个例子，当然不是说，我们每个人也都得像马克思、恩格斯两人一样，必须把人类社会生产发展的历史、自然发展的历史和上层建筑发展的历史通通弄清楚了以后再来谈哲学或经济学的理论问题，而是说，我们应该在他们已经创立的理论基础上去开辟新的研究领域，像他们一样，应用他们的观点和方法，去研究社会历史、自然和意识形态中的还没有解决或者还没有完全解决的问题，而不是仅仅躺在马克思、恩格斯的遗产上过活。
    我想，如果有一个管理思想工作的机关，能够把这些研究计划和论文计划都通通收集起来研究一下，及时纠正一些走弯路的现象，那对我们科学发展的前途会是十分有帮助的。
