Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 25th: From June of last year to mid-February of this year, the Fuling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan Province, with the assistance of local farmers, discovered ninety-nine kinds of wild plants that can be used as industrial raw materials. They include: wild dream flowers, a high-quality raw material for high-grade wax paper; rock shuttle grass, which can be used to make straw paper; medicinal vines that can be used to weave miners' safety helmets; and plants such as Old Mouse Thorn and Ilex purpurea, which can be used as dyes, as well as wild oil plants such as Diospyros kaki.

These wild plants are almost all over the mountains and fields of Fuling, and more than half of them can be collected all year round. In the past, most of these plants were discarded. Now, after being discovered by the supply and marketing cooperative, farmers are actively collecting them. Wild plants such as wild dream flowers have been sold to Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other places.

    四川涪陵从野生植物中
    找到九十九种工业原料
    新华社成都25日电　自去年6月到今年2月中旬，四川省涪陵县供销合作部门在当地农民的协助下发掘出九十九种可作工业原料的野生植物。它们包括：高级蜡纸的优质原料野梦花、可造草纸的岩梭草；可以用来编制矿工安全帽的药藤，还有老鼠刺、冻绿刺等可做染料的植物，和牛柿子等多种野生油料植物。
    这些野生植物几乎遍布涪陵的山野，其中半数以上一年四季都可采集。过去，这些植物大部分都被废弃了。现在经过供销合作部门发掘后，农民们正在积极采集。野梦花等野生植物并已远销到浙江、江西等地。
