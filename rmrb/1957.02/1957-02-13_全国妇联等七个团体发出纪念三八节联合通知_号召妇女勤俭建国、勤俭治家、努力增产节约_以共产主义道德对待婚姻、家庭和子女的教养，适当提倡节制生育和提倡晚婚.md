    This newspaper reports that the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and six other organizations have issued a joint notice regarding the commemoration of International Women's Day on March 8, 1957. The full text is as follows:
        (I)
    Last year, Chinese women celebrated the basic victory of socialist transformation in our country, actively participated in socialist construction, and commemorated International Women's Day with the goal of "striving to be active participants in socialist construction." In the past year, the number of female employees in various sectors of the national economy, culture and education, medical and health services, and state organs has greatly increased. According to preliminary estimates, there are approximately 3 million, over 100 million female members in agricultural cooperatives, about 1.5 million female members in handicraft cooperatives, and over 700,000 female cadres in various positions. They have all worked actively and made significant contributions to socialist transformation and construction. In addition, a large number of employees' family members, handicraft workers' family members, the broad masses of housewives, and industrialists' and businessmen's family members have also directly and indirectly strived to serve socialist construction. In the past year, a large number of glorious female activists in socialist construction have emerged in various political, economic, and cultural positions, in various social activities, and in family life.
    Internationally, in the past year, the imperialist plans for aggression and subversion against socialist countries have suffered serious failures. The unity of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become more consolidated and developed, and its strength has become even greater. The national independence movements in Asian, African, and Latin American countries have continued to surge, and all forces in the world that uphold peace and democracy have greatly developed. However, imperialism will not be reconciled to failure and continues to implement its policy of war preparation. The entire people must heighten their vigilance. In the past year, Chinese women have been mobilized under the goal of safeguarding world peace and developing friendship with women of all countries. We have conducted friendly exchanges with women from the vast majority of countries around the world in various aspects. These actions have made us even more confident that the task of defending peace is a lasting and arduous one, and that the unity of peace forces can defeat the forces of war.
          (II)
    This year – 1957 – in commemorating International Women's Day on March 8th, the various levels of our organizations should, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, call on women to continue to enhance their communist ideological awareness, strengthen unity, build the country and manage households diligently and frugally, and continue to strive to be active participants in socialist construction. This is in order to work with the people of the whole country, strive for increased production and thrift, strive to complete and overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan, and welcome the Second Five-Year Plan. At the same time, we must continuously enhance the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, increase understanding and develop friendship with peace-loving women from all countries around the world, safeguard world peace, support the just struggle for national independence, and protect the rights and interests of women and children.
    To this end, the various levels of our organizations should focus on publicizing the following points during the International Women's Day on March 8th commemoration activities:
    (1) Further publicize to women the superiority of the socialist system, the relationship between the socialist system and the thorough liberation of women, enhance women's sense of responsibility in the cause of socialist construction, correctly understand the relationship between individual interests and collective interests, national interests, immediate interests and long-term interests, consolidate the view that labor is glorious, and strive for increased production and thrift.
    Encourage all women in production, work, and study positions to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity, persist in studying theory, policies, science, and culture, diligently study technology and business, improve their working ability, and strive to make greater contributions to socialist construction.
    Deeply publicize to rural women the benefits that agricultural cooperation has brought to women, so that they can further recognize the role of rural women in socialist construction in rural areas, encourage them to actively participate in agricultural production and sideline production, develop a diversified rural economy, and continue to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives.
    Publicize the superiority of handicraft production cooperatives to female handicraft workers, encourage them to further strengthen unity, learn production technology, improve their political, professional, and cultural levels, and do a good job in production.
    Encourage female industrialists and businessmen to continue to reform their thinking and give full play to their expertise to serve the development of production.
    Continue to publicize and implement the "Five Goods" (i.e., good family and neighborhood unity and mutual assistance, good family life arrangements, good education of children, good encouragement of family members to produce, work, and study, and good self-study) to all housewives. In order to make the publicity work more in-depth, the publicity should be combined with the specific requirements of the masses and the central tasks of the time and locality, and carried out in a focused and specific manner. It is also necessary to help them, starting from the specific situation of their own families, strengthen the unity between families and neighbors based on the communist ideological principles and the spirit of thrift, do a good job in household chores, encourage family members, and educate their children well, and strive for increased production and thrift. At the same time, housewives should be encouraged to actively participate in social activities and implement the policies and decrees of the Party and the government.
    (2) While publicizing and encouraging women to participate in the movement to increase production and practice thrift, it is necessary to advocate the protection of the health and safety of women and children. In various production and work activities in urban and rural areas, it is necessary to advocate the rational use of women's labor force, taking care of women's housework and special difficulties, in order to give fuller play to women's socialist enthusiasm. Labor safety measures and women's and children's welfare undertakings that must be done and can be done should be organized in a spirit of diligence and thrift, relying on the masses, pooling wisdom and efforts, and adhering to the organization. Those that cannot be held temporarily should be patiently explained to the masses of women.
    For the sake of the health of mothers and infants, the education of children, and the prosperity of the nation, our organizations at all levels should appropriately advocate birth control. Continue to publicize to both men and women the benefits of appropriately regulating the density of births. For men and women who have birth control requirements, we should guide them to adopt the currently effective contraceptive methods and persuade them not to be afraid of trouble and not to take contraceptives indiscriminately.
    (3) Publicize to the society and to women to treat marriage, family, and child-rearing with communist morality. In terms of marriage: advocate establishing and consolidating families that conform to the socialist spirit on the basis of equality between men and women; oppose marriage views that start from the simple pursuit of material enjoyment and rash marriage and divorce. At the same time, young men and women should be educated to recognize the harm of early marriage, and continue to oppose early marriage behavior that has not reached the age of marriage. For young people who have reached the age of marriage, we can also appropriately publicize the benefits of getting married a little later, help young women improve their socialist sense of career, and encourage them to concentrate on learning various knowledge and skills and strive for socialist construction. However, this should not interfere with the marriage of young men and women who have reached the age of marriage, because this is a legal marriage. It must also be recognized that appropriately advocating late marriage is an educational process and must be completely based on the consciousness of young men and women. It is necessary to prevent the use of any administrative orders or rude methods. In the relationship between parents and children, advocate children supporting their parents, continue to publicize the traditional virtues of respecting the old and loving the young, respecting mothers-in-law and loving daughters-in-law, and mutual fostering and support between parents and children. Advocate that parents set an example in educating young children to be honest, friendly, hardworking, and thrifty; educate children who have entered school to be "three good" students, and care about children's after-school life. Oppose the idea and behavior of disliking and abusing the elderly, and oppose the idea and behavior of being irresponsible to children, as well as spoiling or beating them.
    When carrying out publicity work in various places, it is necessary to pay attention to starting from the local situation, and first summarize the achievements and experiences of local women in socialist transformation and construction to combine publicity and education, so that women can clearly understand the specific goals of this year's efforts and encourage them to strive for greater achievements.
          (III)
    Methods for commemorating International Women's Day on March 8, 1957:
    (1) The activities commemorating International Women's Day on March 8 in various places should proceed from the actual situation at the time and place, and be carried out through various meetings (such as women's representative meetings, professional women's representative meetings, or regional meetings divided into sections, etc.). The specific methods are determined by each place. In addition to appropriately publicizing the above-mentioned contents at various commemorative meetings, attention should also be paid to appropriately commending a group of female labor models, female advanced producers, and female activists in all aspects of socialist construction.
    (2) We suggest that before the commemoration of International Women's Day on March 8, various newspapers, periodicals, news agencies, films, dramas, and various propaganda agencies should formulate publicity plans based on the above-mentioned publicity content and combined with the conditions of their own units, and conduct extensive and in-depth publicity.
    (3) It is also necessary to strengthen ties with the broad masses of women through the commemoration activities of International Women's Day on March 8, and further work with the masses of women to prepare for the Third National Women's Congress and the National Employee Family Representative Conference.
    (4) In areas where there are foreign female experts or expert wives, the organizations at all levels of our various groups should suggest to the local foreign expert working agencies to jointly organize get-together activities with relevant units.

    全国妇联等七个团体发出纪念三八节联合通知
    号召妇女勤俭建国、勤俭治家、努力增产节约
    以共产主义道德对待婚姻、家庭和子女的教养，适当提倡节制生育和提倡晚婚
    本报讯　中华全国民主妇女联合会等七个团体发出关于纪念1957年三八国际妇女节的联合通知，全文如下：
        （一）
    去年，我国妇女是在欢庆我国社会主义改造取得基本胜利，积极参加社会主义建设，“争取做社会主义建设的积极分子”的目标下来纪念“三八”国际妇女节的。一年来在国民经济的各个部门、文化教育、医务卫生、国家机关等方面的女职工已大量增加，据初步估算，约有三百万人左右，农业合作社的女社员约有一亿多人，手工业合作社女社员约有一百五十万人左右，在各种岗位上的女干部约有七十多万人，她们都积极劳动，对社会主义改造和建设，作出了重大贡献。还有大批职工家属、手工业者家属、广大的家庭劳动妇女以及工商业者家属，也直接间接地努力为社会主义建设服务。一年来，在政治的、经济的、文化的各种岗位上、各种社会活动中以及家庭生活中，都涌现出了大批的光荣的妇女社会主义建设积极分子。
    在国际上，过去的一年中，帝国主义侵略的计划和颠覆社会主义国家的阴谋，遭到了严重的失败，以苏联为首的和平、民主社会主义阵营各国的团结更加巩固和发展，力量更加强大。亚、非和拉丁美洲各国民族独立运动不断高涨，全世界一切维护和平民主的力量都有了巨大发展；但帝国主义是不会甘心失败的，仍在继续执行备战政策，全国人民必须提高警惕。过去一年来，我国妇女是在保卫世界和平，发展同各国妇女的友谊的目标下行动起来的。我们从各方面同世界绝大多数国家的妇女进行了友好的交往，在这些行动中使我们更加相信，保卫和平的任务是持久的、艰巨的任务，和平力量的团结一致，是能够战胜战争势力的。
          （二）
    今年——1957年纪念“三八”国际妇女节，我们各团体的各级组织，要本着中国共产党第八次全国代表大会和八届二中全会的精神，号召妇女继续提高共产主义的思想觉悟，加强团结、勤俭建国、勤俭治家、继续争取做社会主义建设的积极分子；以便和全国人民一起，努力增产节约，争取完成和超额完成第一个五年计划，迎接第二个五年计划。同时要不断增进以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，与全世界各国爱好和平的妇女增进了解，发展友谊，保卫世界和平，支持争取民族独立的正义斗争，维护妇女儿童权益。
    为此我们各团体的各级组织，在“三八”国际妇女节纪念活动中，要着重宣传下列各点：
    （1）向妇女进一步宣传社会主义制度的优越性，社会主义制度与妇女彻底解放的关系，提高妇女在社会主义建设事业中的责任感，正确认识个人利益和集体利益、国家利益的关系，眼前利益和长远利益的关系，巩固劳动光荣的观点，努力增产节约。
    鼓励一切在生产、工作、学习岗位上的妇女，发扬艰苦朴素的优良传统，坚持不懈地学习理论、政策和科学、文化，刻苦钻研技术和业务，提高工作能力，争取对社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。
    深入地向农村妇女宣传农业合作化带给妇女的好处，使她们更进一步认识农村妇女在农村进行社会主义建设中的作用，鼓励她们积极参加农业生产和副业生产，发展农村多种经济，继续巩固农业生产合作社。
    向女手工业者宣传手工业生产合作社的优越性，鼓励她们进一步加强团结，学习生产技术，提高政治、业务和文化水平，搞好生产。
    鼓励女工商业者继续进行思想改造，并充分发挥自己的专长，为发展生产服务。
    继续向一切家庭妇女宣传贯彻“五好”（即：家庭、邻里团结互助好，家庭生活安排好，教养子女好，鼓励亲人生产、工作、学习好，自己学习好）。为着使宣传工作更加深入，在宣传时应结合群众具体要求，结合当时当地的中心任务，有重点地、具体地进行。还要帮助她们从自己家庭的具体情况出发，本着共产主义的思想原则和勤俭持家的精神，加强家庭和邻里之间的团结，搞好家务，鼓励亲人和教养好子女，更加努力增产节约。同时还要鼓励家庭妇女努力参加社会活动，贯彻执行党和政府的政策法令。
    （2）在宣传鼓励妇女参加增产节约运动的同时，要提倡保护妇女儿童的健康与安全。在城乡各种生产、工作中，要提倡合理使用妇女劳动力，照顾妇女的家务劳动和特有困难，以便更充分发挥妇女的社会主义积极性。对必须办而又可能举办的劳动安全措施与妇女儿童福利事业，要本着勤俭精神，依靠群众，群策群力，坚持举办。凡暂时不能举办的，要耐心地向妇女群众进行解释。
    为了妇婴的健康，子女的教育，民族的繁荣，我们各团体各级组织要适当提倡节制生育。继续向男女双方宣传适当调节生育密度的好处。对于有节育要求的男女群众，我们要引导她（他）们采用现在行之有效的避孕方法，说服她（他）：不要怕麻烦，不要乱吃避孕药。
    （3）向社会、向妇女宣传以共产主义道德对待婚姻、家庭和子女的教养。婚姻方面：提倡在男女平等的基础上，建立和巩固符合社会主义精神的家庭；反对从单纯追求物质享受出发的婚姻观点和轻率的结婚、离婚等行为。同时要教育青年男女认识早婚的害处，继续反对没有到达婚龄的早婚行为。对于到达婚龄的青年，我们也可适当地宣传晚一点结婚的好处，帮助青年妇女提高社会主义事业心，鼓励她们好好集中力量学习各种知识和本领，努力社会主义建设工作。但不能因此干涉到达婚龄的青年男女的结婚，因为这是合法的婚姻。并且要认识适当提倡晚婚，是一个教育过程，是要完全建筑在青年男女自觉的基础之上的，必须防止采用任何行政命令的粗暴办法。在父母子女关系上提倡子女扶养父母，继续宣传尊老爱幼、尊婆爱媳、父母子女相互抚育和赡养的美德。提倡父母以身作则教育幼儿诚实、友爱、勤劳、俭朴；教育已入学的子女做
  “三好”学生，并关心子女课余生活。反对嫌弃老人和虐待老人的思想和行为，反对对子女不负责任以及溺爱或打骂等思想和行为。
    各地在进行宣传工作时，必须注意从本地情况出发，并首先总结当地妇女在社会主义改造和建设方面所取得的成就和经验来结合进行宣传，教育妇女群众明确今年努力的具体目标，鼓舞她们为争取获得更大的成绩而努力。
          （三）
    1957年纪念“三八”国际妇女节的办法：
    （1）各地纪念“三八”国际妇女节的活动，应从当时、当地的实际情况出发，通过多种多样的会议（如妇女代表性会议、职业妇女代表会议或分片、分段的地区性会议等）进行纪念。具体办法由各地自行规定。在各种纪念会上，除适当宣传上述各项内容外，并应注意适当地表扬一批女劳动模范、女先进生产者和参加社会主义建设的各方面的妇女积极分子。
    （2）我们建议在纪念“三八”国际妇女节前，各报刊、通讯社、电影、戏剧以及各种宣传机构，根据上述宣传内容，结合本单位的条件，制定宣传计划，广泛深入地进行宣传。
    （3）还要通过“三八”国际妇女节的纪念活动，加强与广大妇女群众的联系，并进一步和妇女群众一起，作好迎接第三次全国妇女代表大会和全国职工家属代表会议的准备工作。
    （4）凡有外国女专家或专家夫人的地区，我们各团体的各级组织要向当地外国专家工作机构建议，联合有关单位组织联欢活动。
