    Debate on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the US Congress
    Meiao

    Since the announcement of Eisenhower's Middle East plan, it has been met with widespread opposition, to the point that its supporters have had to repeatedly revise it, so that it has yet to be officially released. Even during the discussion of this plan in the US Congress, many congressmen have raised various objections to it; the Senate is currently engaged in fierce debate. What does this debate in the US Congress indicate?

    When US Secretary of State Dulles testified before Congress last month in favor of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," he was subjected to severe questioning and criticism by members of Congress, marking the most intense congressional attack on the government since Republicans attacked Acheson in early 1950. Representative Hays even withdrew from the closed-door meeting to hear Dulles' testimony in protest of the government's policy. On January 27, Senator Humphrey called for Dulles' removal, and Senators Sparkman and Kefauver demanded an investigation into Dulles' foreign policy practices, creating a wave of anti-Dulles sentiment. Eisenhower had to personally intervene on January 23 and January 29 to exert pressure on Congress and defend Dulles. The House finally passed a resolution supporting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on January 30. According to congressional leaders from both parties, the debate in the Senate may continue until the end of February or the beginning of March.

    So far, more than a dozen members of Congress have explicitly expressed opposition to the "Eisenhower Doctrine," most of whom are Democratic congressmen. Initially, they focused their opposition on granting the President the standby power to use force in the Middle East. Their arguments reflected the fear that the United States would act unilaterally in the Middle East, thereby becoming diplomatically passive, and that the use of force would lead to a world war. Senator Mansfield said: "Our unilateral action in the Middle East will cause many problems, and doing so will put us in the condemned position of the UK, France, and Israel"; another Senator, Morse, wanted Dulles to guarantee that American soldiers would not "go to the Middle East alone"; Representative Hays called for "working through the United Nations." Democratic Congressman Kefauver criticized the "Eisenhower Doctrine" as full of dynamite; former Secretary of State Acheson also testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was "too risky," saying that the plan to grant the President standby power in the Middle East "sounds very dangerous, like another march to the brink of war."

    Later, as the US government repeatedly explained the issue of the use of force, this dispute gradually reached a compromise, and the focus of the debate shifted to the economic aid portion. When Dulles testified before Congress, he repeatedly emphasized the need to provide unconditional grants to those Middle Eastern countries willing to oppose communism. Some congressmen's reaction was the opposite, believing that the details of allocating $200 million in the Middle East were unclear, making it difficult to agree. Senator Jackson said: "If the Secretary of State does not give us a general understanding of how he will use the $200 million he is requesting, we cannot agree." He advocated separating the issue of granting economic aid to the Middle East proposed by the President from the issue of standby power to use armed forces. House Speaker Rayburn also supported this view. Senate Democratic Leader Johnson advocated restricting the President's freedom to use the $200 million already allocated to him for use in the Middle East. Dulles finally had to agree that the term of the emergency power to use this money would be until June 30 of next year.

    The debate over the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a reflection of the conflicting interests of different monopoly groups in the United States. Many of the congressmen who most actively supported Eisenhower's Middle East plan are related to American oil interest groups in the Middle East. Before and after the announcement of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," several major American oil capitalists had already clarified their views on Middle East policy. M. W. Tumburg, one of the main founders of "New Jersey Standard Oil," said in "Fortune" magazine that the time had come to take a more "bold" intervention policy. Retburg, manager of "New Jersey Oil Company," also openly advocated that the United States implement a "tough" policy in the Middle East and "try to lead in restoring peace and stabilizing the situation in this region." The "Eisenhower Doctrine" precisely implements these propositions.

    However, not all US monopoly groups have the same interests in the Middle East; some monopoly capitalists have their main interests in regions outside the Middle East, and they also have their representatives in Congress. "Newsweek" wrote on January 8: "Congressmen who advocate 'Europe First' oppose the 'Middle East Plan,' and congressmen who advocate 'Asia First' express support for the plan." People like Kefauver and Mansfield have less connection with oil companies, so their interests are not in the Middle East; they believe that the United States should not abandon or neglect the care of its European "allies." Kefauver believes that the Middle East plan formulated by the United States should be "primarily for the benefit of Western Europe." Senator Fulbright believes that Dulles' policy is "extremely detrimental to the North Atlantic Organization" and complains that Dulles has "seriously damaged" Britain and France. Senator Morse also echoed this view.

    Therefore, the fierce debate on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the US Congress most clearly shows that this plan is entirely for the benefit of a small handful of American oil monopoly capitalists, and it has nothing in common with safeguarding the security and national interests of the Middle Eastern people.

    美国国会内对“艾森豪威尔主义”的争论
    梅奥
    艾森豪威尔的中东计划公布以后，受到了各方面的广泛反对，以致这个计划的拥护者们不得不一再对它提出修改，以致到现在还未能正式出炉。就是在美国国会讨论这个计划的过程中，也有不少议员对它提出了各种反对意见；参议院目前还在进行着激烈的争论。美国国会的这种争论说明了什么呢？
    美国国务卿杜勒斯上个月在国会中为“艾森豪威尔主义”作证的时候，就曾受到议员严厉的质询和抨击，成为1950年初共和党人攻击艾奇逊以来国会攻击政府最厉害的一次。众议员海斯甚至退出听取杜勒斯作证的秘密会议，表示抗议政府的政策。1月27日，参议员汉弗莱要求撤换杜勒斯，斯巴克曼和克弗维尔要求调查杜勒斯在外交上的做法，一时形成一阵倒杜勒斯的风潮。艾森豪威尔不得不在1月23日和1月29日亲自出马对国会施加压力，并为杜勒斯辩护。1月30日，众院才最后通过了支持“艾森豪威尔主义”的决议。据国会两党领袖认为，参院正在进行的辩论可能延续到2月底或3月初。
    到目前止，国会中明确表示反对“艾森豪威尔主义”的议员有十多人，其中大部分是民主党议员。他们最初集中反对授予总统在中东使用武力的备用权。他们的论调反映出害怕美国在中东单干从而在外交上陷于被动，害怕由于使用武力而引起世界大战。参议员曼斯菲尔德说：“我们单独进入中东的行动将会引起许多问题，这样做会使我们自己处在英、法、以三国所处的受谴责的地位”；另一位参议员莫尔斯要杜勒斯保证美国兵不“单独到中东去”；众议员海斯要求“通过联合国工作”。民主党议员克弗维尔抨击“艾森豪威尔主义”充满了炸药；前国务卿艾奇逊在众院外交委员会作证时也认为“艾森豪威尔主义”“太冒险”，他说，要求在中东授予总统备用权的计划“听起来十分危险，像是又一次走向战争边缘”。
    后来，由于美国政府对使用武力问题一再进行解释，这一争执已逐步取得调协，争论的中心遂转移到经济援助部分。杜勒斯在国会作证时曾再三强调要无偿赠予那些愿意反共的中东国家。有些议员们的反应却是相反，认为在中东拨用二亿美元的细节安排不明，很难表示同意。参议员杰克逊就说：“如果国务卿不使我们大体了解他怎样使用他所要求的二亿美元，我们没法同意。”他主张把总统提出的给予中东经济援助的问题和使用武装部队的备用权问题分开来表决。众议院议长雷朋也支持这种主张。参院民主党领袖约翰逊主张限制总统自由使用已经拨给他用在中东的两亿美元的权力。杜勒斯最后只得同意使用这笔钱的紧急权力的期限到明年6月30日为止。
    在“艾森豪威尔主义”上所发生的争论，是美国不同垄断集团利害冲突的反映。支持艾森豪威尔中东计划最积极的议员很多都是同美国在中东的石油利益集团有关系的。在“艾森豪威尔主义”公布的前后，美国几个大石油资本家就已经阐明了他们对中东政策的看法。“新泽西美孚石油公司”的主要创办人之一马·威·汤勃格在“幸福”杂志上说，已经到了采取比较“大胆”的干涉政策的时候。“新泽西石油公司”经理雷特勃也公开主张美国在中东实行“强硬”政策，并“尝试进行领导来恢复和平和稳定这个地区的局势”。“艾森豪威尔主义”正是贯彻了这些主张。
    但是，并不是美国所有的垄断集团是对中东地区都怀有同样兴趣的；也有一些垄断资本家的主要利益在于中东以外的地区，他们在国会中也有自己的代理人。1月8日的“新闻周刊”就写道：“主张欧洲第一的议员反对‘中东计划’，主张亚洲第一的议员表示支持这项计划。”像克弗维尔和曼斯菲尔德等人和石油企业关系较少，因此他们的兴趣不在中东，他们认为美国不应该放弃或忽视对欧洲“盟国”的照顾。克弗维尔认为美国所拟订的中东计划应当“首先是为了西欧的好处。”参议员富布赖特认为杜勒斯奉行的政策是“极不利于北大西洋组织的”，并且埋怨杜勒斯“严重损害了”英国和法国。参议员莫尔斯也附和这种意见。
    因此，美国国会中对“艾森豪威尔主义”的激烈争论最清楚不过地表明这个计划是完全为了美国一小撮石油垄断资本家的利益的，它和维护中东人民的安全和民族利益毫无共同之处。
