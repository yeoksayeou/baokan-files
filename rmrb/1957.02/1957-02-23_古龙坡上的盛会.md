Thousands of people of Miao, Yao, Dong, Zhuang, and Han ethnicities from all over the Greater Miao Mountains gathered on Gulong Slope by the Liujia River on the 15th (Lunar January 16th) to joyfully celebrate this traditional festival. Around eleven o'clock that morning, people of all ethnicities, dressed in festive attire, came to Gulong Slope from mountain paths in all directions, playing reed pipes and beating gongs and drums. The Miao farmers of Yitang (team) in Bangou, Sihe Township, more than thirty li away, arrived earliest with their reed pipes. After playing several majestic tunes, the reed pipe band switched to a "stepping the hall" dance tune. The reed pipe players played and danced, and a dozen Miao girls wearing blue lace clothes and pleated skirts lined up, entered the reed pipe circle, and danced to the rhythm of the reed pipes. The audience outside the reed pipe circle surrounded them in layers.

In the afternoon, more and more people arrived on the slope. Miao logging workers from the Greater Miao Mountains Forest Industry Bureau's Daqunshan Logging Area came, and the lion dance team of Dong and Han youth farmers from Heping Township also came. Young men and women of Yao, Miao, Zhuang, and Han ethnicities from Xinping Township and Yangling Township played shuttlecock together. On the river beach below Gulong Slope, a group of young people were holding a horse race. In a corner of the hillside, several middle-aged men took down bird cages from the branches and put them together, starting a bird fight.

Just as the various performances on Gulong Slope were at their most active, some young men and women quietly slipped away. Young men selected the things that girls liked most from the sales booths and gave them to the girls they fancied as gifts; the girls took out exquisitely embroidered flower belts from their pockets and silently put them into the pockets of the young men. Through such exchanges, they established friendships and even fell in love. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the most exciting performance program—the reed pipe competition—began, with seven teams (more than two hundred) reed pipes playing together. The majestic sound of the reed pipes seemed to transport people to a scene of ten thousand horses galloping and vast waves surging, and the audience's excitement reached its climax. More than half an hour later, as soon as the sound of the reed pipes stopped, pairs of young men and women were confiding their admiration to each other, saying goodbye with reluctance. People who came from afar to attend the slope fair also returned to the homes of relatives and friends in nearby villages to be guests.

The Gulong Slope Fair in the Greater Miao Mountains Miao Autonomous County, Guangxi Province, is held three times a year (on the sixth day of the first lunar month, the sixteenth day of the first lunar month, and the sixteenth day of the eighth lunar month). According to local traditional customs, this is the last joyous gathering during the Spring Festival. After attending this slope fair, farmers of all ethnicities begin to devote their full efforts to spring production.

    古龙坡上的盛会
    新华社记者　陈蓬生
    来自大苗山各地的苗、瑶、侗、僮、汉等族人民数千人，15日（农历正月16日）聚集在六甲河畔的古龙坡上，欢乐地度过了这个传统的节日。这天上午十一时左右，穿着节日盛装的各族人民，从四面八方的山道上，吹着籚笙，敲锣打鼓，来到古龙坡上。来自三十多里外的四合乡半沟的苗族农民的一堂（队）籚笙到得最早。这堂籚笙连奏了几个雄壮的曲调，就改奏“踩堂”舞曲，籚笙手边吹边舞，十几个穿着青色花边衣服和褶皱裙的苗族姑娘排成一行，走进籚笙圈里，和着籚笙的节拍起舞。在籚笙圈外的观众，一层又一层紧密地围上去。
    午后，越来越多的人赶到了坡上。大苗山森林工业局大群山采伐所的苗族采伐工人来了，和平乡侗、汉族青年农民的舞狮队也来了。新平乡和杨岭乡的瑶、苗、僮、汉等族的男女青年在一起打鸡毛球。在古龙坡下的河滩上，一群青年在进行跑马比赛。在坡地的一角，几个中年人从树枝上取下了鸟笼靠在一起，开始斗鸟。
    正当古龙坡上各种表演最活跃的时候，有些男女青年却悄悄地溜走了。小伙子在售货摊上选购了姑娘们最喜爱的东西，送给看中了的姑娘作礼品；姑娘从口袋里掏出精工刺绣的花带，默默地放进了小伙子的口袋。他们通过这样的交往，建立了友谊，甚至发生了爱情。下午四时，最精彩的表演节目——籚笙比赛开始了，七堂（两百多把）籚笙紧靠在一起吹奏。这雄壮的籚笙声，好像把人们带到了万马奔腾、波涛万顷的境地，观众的兴奋已经达到最高潮。半个多钟头以后，籚笙声一停，一对对的男女青年又在互相倾吐着爱慕，依依不舍地告别。从远处来赶坡的人，也回到附近村寨里的亲戚朋友家里去作客。
    广西省大苗山苗族自治县的古龙坡会，每年举行三次（在农历正月初六，正月十六日，八月十六日）。按照当地传统习惯，这是春节期间最后一次欢乐的集会，各族农民在赶过这次坡会以后，就开始以全力投入春季生产。
