    Talking About Lanterns
	Jin Shoushen
    Spring Festival is coming, and I can't help but think of the times when I was a child buying lanterns, playing with lanterns, watching lanterns, and strolling through the lantern fairs. Loving to play with lanterns, loving these lanterns rich in national character, is part of the rich artistic life of the Chinese people. I was born in Beijing, grew up in Beijing, and have never left Beijing for work. I like everything about Beijing. Especially the lanterns during the Spring Festival in Beijing, I love them even more.

    In my childhood, every year from the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month onwards, I began my lantern-buying activities, which could actually be said to be loitering around the lantern stalls. At that time, after the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month in Beijing, look at the major streets and markets, especially the area outside the first and second alleys of Dongsi Archway, wow, there were so many lantern stalls: oil paper lanterns hung on ropes, revolving lanterns placed on shelves, sheep lanterns and carriage lanterns on the ground, and those countless strings of sunflower lanterns, everywhere was surrounded by children, so crowded that no water could leak through. Oil paper lanterns were made with bamboo frames and covered with painted colored oil paper, including dragon eye fish lanterns, katydid lanterns, cabbage lanterns, peach lanterns, pomegranate lanterns... The most interesting were the turtle lanterns with their heads and four claws moving randomly. These oil paper lanterns were products of Tongxian County in eastern Beijing, and were "rough goods" looked down upon by lantern painting shops specializing in palace lanterns and gauze lanterns, and the so-called "mansion gates" of royal residences, but they attracted the vast majority of viewers. In the second half of the twelfth lunar month, I was a loyal viewer who visited these lantern stalls every day. The revolving lanterns with their constantly rotating and running figures; the sheep lanterns with their black heads and white bodies that nodded when moved; and the carriage lanterns that looked like large sedan chairs, were the lanterns that we children loved the most. Oil paper lanterns were considered high-end lanterns in the eyes of children, and they could pester adults to buy them, but revolving lanterns, sheep lanterns, and carriage lanterns were a must-buy. As for sunflower lanterns and the crudest little red lanterns, everyone had one. When the lantern stalls closed on New Year's Eve, it was see you next year after the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month. Big and small children, carrying little red lanterns, ran around the streets, looking like red stars all over the ground; little children, pulling carriage lanterns, practiced walking in the house. At that time, I didn't realize that these scenes could be cherished, but now I know that they had endless fun.

    From the second day of the first lunar month onwards—the first day because we played all night on New Year's Eve and went to bed early—we played with sheep lanterns, carriage lanterns, and sunflower lanterns every night, watching revolving lanterns, really never getting tired of watching and playing every day. On the evening of the eighth day, adults had to "appease the stars," scatter lantern flowers, and pray to the "Star God" for "smoothness," and we children boosted the atmosphere. The red lanterns of the children were somewhat like competing with the lantern flowers for brightness. The thirteenth to fifteenth days of the first month were the so-called "Lantern Festival," and from older children onwards, they would go lantern viewing. The history of lantern viewing is the history of watching "Mount Ao" since the Tang and Song dynasties. Beijing didn't have Mount Ao, but it had square gauze lanterns in the style of comic strips, with entire stories painted on them, attracting tens of thousands of viewers. Even those who had seen them every year would watch them again and again. In the Ming dynasty, Beijing's lantern market was naturally in "Lantern Market Street" in the eastern city. In the Qing dynasty, the market moved to "Changdian," and the lanterns were scattered in various government offices, temples, and pastry shops (called "bobopu" in Beijing) in the nine cities. I didn't see the famous Ministry of Works lanterns and Ministry of War lanterns of the Qing dynasty, but I watched the lanterns in the temples and pastry shops every year. Every year during these five days, I went lantern viewing every day. Because my home was in the northeast city, I always went to Jingzhong Temple in Beixinqiao first to see the entire "Story of Yue Fei," and every time I saw Fengbo Pavilion, I would curse Qin Hui as I walked out of the temple. From Beixinqiao westward, the lights were brilliant and the firecrackers crackled, and I arrived at the Drum Tower without feeling lonely. The ice lanterns of the Xiaomen Jiang store (dried fruit store) in front of the Drum Tower were even more attractive, making lantern shapes out of sparkling ice blocks and lighting candles inside, different from glass lanterns. From there southward, turning past Di'anmen, it wasn't far to Wanping County City God Temple. The "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" gauze lanterns at the temple gate were not very popular, but the "Fire Judge" made of mud in the courtyard, with coal burning in its belly and flames coming out of its seven orifices, was surrounded by viewers non-stop. Although the lights and candles were bright in the main hall, no one was willing to take a look at the golden face of the "City God." I habitually followed the imperial city wall eastward, not afraid of the long distance, just to go lantern viewing, and arrived at the Xiaomen Jiang store on Longfusi Street again. This Xiaomen Jiang store didn't have ice lanterns, but it had wheat lanterns. In fixed models, wheat seeds were sown in the first half of the month, and when the wheat seedlings emerged, the dragon-shaped one looked like a green dragon, and the bird-shaped one looked like a green bird. Lighting candles in the middle made them very unique, and the lantern viewers all felt very novel. Opposite the east entrance of Longfusi Street was the first alley of Dongsi Archway. There was a Fire God Temple in the first alley. Although the gauze lanterns of the Fire God Temple were old, there were a lot of people watching the lanterns, because the pictures on this set of gauze lanterns depicted "Ji Xiaotang Catching Demons." The story was bizarre and a local Beijing myth, and everyone wanted to know the "miracles" of this Beijing "celebrity." At the same time, an old man named Wang lived in the temple and could tell the story of Ji Xiaotang catching demons. He gave free explanations to lantern viewers every day, and always fulfilled requests. Every time we went, we always asked: "Grandpa Wang, how did Ji Xiaotang squeeze into the wall and disappear?" Old man Wang always smiled and said: "Magic! Would you like to learn it?" Therefore, I still want to go and see the gauze lanterns of the Fire God Temple today. Exiting the west entrance of the first alley was Dongsibei Street. The large pastry shops of Juqingzhai and Ruifangzhai all hung gauze lanterns, some painted with Romance of the Three Kingdoms, some painted with Water Margin, and some painted with Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. The lantern viewers squeezed together to watch them one by one. Even after watching them for one or two decades, they were still interested.

    It's been almost thirty years since I've gone lantern viewing, and the square gauze lanterns have been replaced by noble palace lanterns, painted and red new round gauze lanterns. But the scenes of lantern viewing still remain in my mind, and I can't forget them for a long time.

    谈灯	金受申
    春节到了，我不禁想起儿时买灯、玩灯、看灯、逛灯的事来。爱玩灯，爱玩这富有民族色彩的灯，是中国人民丰富的艺术生活的一部分。我是生在北京，长在北京，工作始终没离开过北京的人，对于北京的一切，都是喜欢的。尤其对于北京过春节时候的灯，更是爱它。
    在孩子时代，我每年从农历腊月十五日以后，就开始了买灯活动，实际也可以说是蹓灯摊子。那时，北京过了腊月十五日，各大街市，尤其东四牌楼头二条口外一带，看吧，灯摊子太多了：绳子上挂的是油纸灯，架子上搁的是走马灯，地上放的是羊灯、车灯，还有那一串串数不过来的葵花灯，到处都被小孩子围了个风雨不透。油纸灯是竹篾做架，外面糊画好了的彩色油纸，有龙睛鱼灯、蝈蝈灯、白菜灯、桃灯、石榴灯……最有趣的是头尾四爪乱动的王八灯。这类油纸灯，是京东通县产品，是被专做宫灯、纱灯的灯画店和所谓王公宅第的“府门头”看不起的“糙货”，但却吸引了绝大多数观众。我在腊月的下半月，就是这种灯摊子的每日必到的忠实观众。来回旋转，人物奔驰的走马灯；一动就点头的黑头白身的羊灯；像个大轿子似的车灯，更是我们小孩子最喜爱的灯。油纸灯，在小孩子眼里，是高级灯，可以磨着大人买，走马灯、羊灯、车灯，那就非买不可了。至于葵花灯和最粗糙的小红灯笼，更是人手一个的。到了大年夜灯摊子收市了，明年腊月十五以后再见了。大小孩子，提着小红灯笼出来进去地满街乱跑，仿佛满地红星一般；小小孩子，拉着车灯，在屋子里学步。那时候，不觉得这种情景的可以珍惜，现在才知道是有无穷风趣的。
    从正月初二日起——初一因为头天除夕玩了一夜，早早睡觉了——天天晚上玩羊灯、车灯、葵花灯，看走马灯，真是天天看、天天玩也不厌烦。到了初八这天晚上，大人们要“顺星”，要散灯花，要向“星神爷”求“顺”了，助威的却是我们小孩子们。小孩子们的红灯笼，很有点像和灯花比赛光明似的。正月十三到十五，是所谓“灯节”了，从半大小孩子以上，就要逛灯了。逛灯的历史，就是唐宋以来的看“鳌山”，北京没有鳌山，却有连环画式的方形纱灯，上面画着整部的说部故事，它吸引了成千上万的观众。就是每年都看过的，也要再一次又一次地看。北京在明代，自然是连灯带市集都在东城“灯市口”的。到了清代，集市挪在“厂甸”，灯就散在九城各衙署、庙宇、糕点铺（北京叫饽饽铺）了。清代有名的工部灯、兵部灯，我没看过，庙宇和糕点铺的灯，我却年年要看。每年在这五天里，是天天逛灯。因为我家住在东北城，所以我第一处总是先到北新桥精忠庙，看全部“说岳传”，而且每次看到风波亭，总是骂着秦桧走出庙来。从北新桥往西，一路灯火辉煌，爆竹连天，毫不寂寞地就到了鼓楼了。鼓楼前小门姜店（干果店）的冰灯，更吸引人了，把亮晶晶的冰块，做出灯形来，里面点着蜡烛，和玻璃灯不同了。从这再往南，拐过地安门去，不远就到宛平县城隍庙了。庙门洞的“三国志”纱灯，倒不怎么受人欢迎，院里的泥堆的“火判”，肚里升煤，七窍冒火，却被观众围着看个不休。大殿里虽然灯烛明亮，谁也不肯去看看“城隍爷”的金面。我习惯地顺着皇城根一直往东，不怕路远，只为逛灯，就又到了隆福寺街的小门姜店。这个小门姜店，没有冰灯，却有麦子灯。在固定的模型里，前半个月撒上麦种，到时候麦苗出齐了，龙形的像一条青龙，鸟形的像一只青鸟，中间点起蜡烛来，就很别致了，逛灯的人都感觉到很新奇。出了隆福寺街东口，对面就是东四牌楼头条。头条口里有一座火神庙，火神庙的纱灯，虽然陈旧，但看灯的人特别多，这就是因为这一组纱灯的画面画的是“计小唐捉妖”，故事既离奇，又是北京本地的神话故事，大家都愿意知道知道这位北京“名人”的“奇迹”；同时，庙里住着一位王老头，是会讲计小唐捉妖故事的。他天天给逛灯的人做义务解说员，而且是有求必应。我们每次去了，总是问：“王大爷，计小唐怎么挤进墙去就看不见了？”王老头也总是笑着说：“法术嘛！你愿意学吗？”因此，火神庙的纱灯，直到今天我还想再去看看。出了头条西口，就是东四北大街了，那聚庆斋、瑞芳斋几家大糕点铺，家家挂着纱灯，有画三国志的，有画水浒的，有画聊斋志异的，逛灯的人一家挨一家的挤着看，看过一二十年，也还是有兴趣的。
    灯是快三十年不逛了，而且方形的纱灯，也被高贵的宫灯，彩画和红色的新圆纱灯代替了。但逛灯的情景，却仍留在我的头脑中，久久不能忘掉。
