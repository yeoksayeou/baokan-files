Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 1st. On the morning of February 1st, all the workers of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine collectively wrote a letter to the State Council, the Ministry of the Coal Industry, and the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union, reporting on their increased coal production during the Spring Festival.

The letter stated, "After conveying the State Council's call for normal production during the two days of the Spring Festival holiday on January 27th, all of us workers at the Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine immediately and enthusiastically responded to this urgent call. Among us, 702 people had planned to return home before the Spring Festival to visit relatives and friends, and some were planning to get married. However, after these comrades heard the State Council's call, many canceled their train tickets, and all but a few dozen with special circumstances decided to stay."

"January 31st was the first day of our holiday production. Comrades from higher-level organizations such as the Shenyang Bureau of the Ministry of the Coal Industry and the Liaoning Provincial Trade Union stayed with us day and night during our production, giving us great encouragement. Therefore, by zero o'clock on February 1st, all the workers in our mine had completed the task of mining 10,021 tons of coal under safe conditions. This figure is higher than the actual average daily output in January."

The letter concluded, "We assure the State Council, the Ministry of the Coal Industry, and the Coal Miners' Union that we will certainly overfulfill the glorious task of mining coal during the Spring Festival holiday."

    海州露天煤矿职工向国务院报喜
    假期生产第一天采煤一万多吨
    新华社阜新1日电　阜新海州露天煤矿全体职工在2月1日早晨，集体给国务院、煤炭工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会写了一封信，报告他们春节增产煤炭的情况。
    信里说，我们海州露天煤矿全体职工在1月27日传达了国务院关于春节假期两天照常生产的号召以后，立即积极地响应了这个紧急的号召。在我们当中，春节前有七百零二人准备回家探亲访友，有的人要回家结婚。但是，当这些同志听到国务院的号召以后，很多人退了火车票，除几十个人有特殊情况以外，都决定留下来。
    1月31日，是我们假期生产的第一天。煤炭工业部沈阳管理局、辽宁省工会等上级机关的同志，在我们生产的时候昼夜二十四小时都和我们在一起，给了我们很大的鼓舞。因此，我们全矿职工到2月1日的零时，在安全的条件下完成了一万零二十一吨的采煤任务，这个数字比1月份的实际平均日产量还多。
    信里最后说，我们向国务院、煤炭工业部、煤矿工会保证，一定超额完成春节假期采煤的光荣任务。
