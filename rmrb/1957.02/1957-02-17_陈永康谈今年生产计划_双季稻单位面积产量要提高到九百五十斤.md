Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: Reporter Gu Ping reports: During the Spring Festival, I interviewed Chen Yongkang, director of the Lianmin Agricultural Cooperative in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, and a national model for high rice yield. I asked him what new plans the cooperative had as the season of spring plowing and production was about to begin. He told me that they were summarizing last year's experiences and lessons and formulating this year's production increase plan.

The Lianmin Cooperative will increase grain production by 920,000 jin for the state this year. They plan to increase the average yield of wheat per mu from 185 jin last year to 250 jin. Single-season late rice will increase from 621 jin to 700 jin. The yield per unit area of double-cropping rice will reach 950 jin, an increase of 23% compared to last year.

The area of wheat fields planted by the Lianmin Cooperative last winter has expanded from more than 700 mu to more than 1,600 mu.

Chen Yongkang said that their cooperative took a slightly larger step in planting double-cropping rice last year and encountered many difficulties. However, facts have proved that double-cropping rice can increase production, and last year's yield was slightly higher than that of single-season late rice. Based on the experience of last year's practice, they plan to reduce the proportion of double-cropping rice from 21% of the rice area last year to 11% this year. Chen Yongkang believes that this way, there will be no difficulties with labor or fertilizer. They are also preparing to plant a portion of coarse grains, broad beans, and cotton, as well as barley, sweet potatoes, and green vegetables for pig feed, according to the soil quality and the needs of the cooperative members.

Chen Yongkang said that in the first year of establishing the advanced cooperative last year, although they suffered continuous attacks from natural disasters such as typhoons, rainstorms, and droughts, the total grain harvest of the cooperative still exceeded the 1955 bumper year by 2.5%. The average annual income per person in the cooperative also increased from 98 yuan in 1955 to 107 yuan. Therefore, the cooperative members' determination to take the road of cooperation is firm, and their labor enthusiasm is high. In addition, the cadres have accumulated a lot of experience in leading collective production, which is a favorable condition for striving for a bumper harvest this year. Chen Yongkang also said: We have also seen the difficulties in production this year, mainly the insufficient production funds. The production expenses needed for spring plowing, such as fertilizer powder and pumping machine fuel, total 8,000 yuan, while the cooperative only has 5,000 yuan in funds. He led me to see their vegetable fields, dairy cows, pigsty, duck flock, and sideline group weaving straw bags. He said that these sideline businesses, plus seven large ships transporting goods outside, can generate an income of 2,000 yuan per month. The problem of insufficient funds can be largely solved.

This year, the replanting area of the Lianmin Cooperative will increase by 12% compared to last year. They also want to eliminate more than 900 mu of low-yield fields and generally increase the amount of fertilizer applied. The amount of fertilizer needed is more than in the past. Chen Yongkang said that they mainly rely on raising more pigs to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage. By the end of February, the number of pigs raised by the entire cooperative will increase from the current average of one per household to one and a half. Chen Yongkang said that after the thaw, more than 1,000 laborers in the cooperative will also start digging the Guantang River and deepening the riverbed. This will not only benefit irrigation but also accumulate a large amount of fertilizer.

Chen Yongkang is about to attend the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference. On the morning of the day he left home, he was still wearing his old cotton jacket, barefoot in straw sandals, carrying pig feed to the pigsty to feed the pigs, just like he usually did. Only when he was about to leave did he put on his new leather jacket and cotton coat. This old model is always so diligent and thrifty. He also leads the Lianmin Agricultural Cooperative diligently and thriftily, just like managing his own home, preparing to make new contributions to the motherland in agricultural production in 1957.

### 陈永康谈今年生产计划  双季稻单位面积产量要提高到九百五十斤

    陈永康谈今年生产计划
    双季稻单位面积产量要提高到九百五十斤
    据新华社南京16日电　记者古平报道：记者在春节后访问了江苏省松江县联民农业社主任、全国水稻丰产模范陈永康。我问他在这春耕大生产的季节就要到来的时候，社里有些什么新打算？他告诉我说，他们正在总结去年的经验教训，制定今年的增产计划。
    联民社今年将要为国家增产粮食九十二万斤。他们计划小麦平均每亩产量从去年的一百八十五斤提高到二百五十斤。单季晚稻从六百二十一斤提高到七百斤。双季稻单位面积产量要达到九百五十斤，比去年增产23％。
    联民社去冬种的麦田面积已从七百多亩扩大到一千六百多亩。
    陈永康说，他们社里去年种双季稻的步子跨得大了一点，碰到很多困难。但事实证明双季稻是能增产的，去年产量也略高于单季晚稻。根据去年实践的经验，他们今年计划把双季稻的比例从去年占水稻面积21％缩减到占11％。陈永康认为这样劳力、肥料都不会碰到什么困难。他们还按照土质和社员需要，准备适当地种一部分杂粮、蚕豆和棉花，以及大麦、山芋、青菜等可作猪饲料的作物。
    陈永康说，去年成立高级社的第一年，虽然连续遭受台风、暴雨和干旱等自然灾害的袭击，但是全社粮食收获量仍然超过1955年丰收年的2.5％，全社人口每人平均的全年收入也从1955年的九十八元增加到一百零七元，因此，社员走合作化道路的决心是坚定的，劳动积极性也高，又加上干部在领导集体生产方面积累了不少经验，这是争取今年大丰收的有利条件。陈永康又说：我们也看到了今年生产上的困难，主要是生产资金不够宽裕。春耕生产需要的肥田粉、抽水机燃料等生产费用共需八千元，而社里只有资金五千元。他领我去看了他们的蔬菜田、奶牛、猪舍、鸭群和编织草包的副业小组。他说，这些副业加上七只大船在外运输，每月可以收入两千元。资金不足的问题就大体上能解决了。
    今年联民社的复种面积将比去年增加12％，还要消灭九百多亩低产田，并且普遍提高施肥量。需要的肥料比过去增多。陈永康说，他们主要靠多养猪解决缺肥的问题。到2月底，他们全社养的猪将从现在的平均每户一头增加到一头半。陈永康说，等解冻以后，社里一千多个劳动力还要动工开挖官塘河，加深河道，这样，既有利于灌溉，又增积了大量肥料。
    陈永康就要去参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议了。他在家里动身那天早上，还和平常一样，穿着旧棉袄，赤脚穿草鞋，挑着猪食到猪舍去喂猪。临走的时候，他才穿上新皮袄，棉大衣。这个老模范永远是这样勤劳俭朴。他也像管理自己的家一样勤俭地领导着联民农业社，准备1957年在农业生产岗位上为祖国作出新的贡献。
