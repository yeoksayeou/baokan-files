America's Two Kinds of "Guarantees"

    Not long ago, when the King of Saudi Arabia visited the United States, the American President spoke many "friendly" words to the Arab countries and made many "guarantees." These "guarantees" were even written in black and white in the form of a joint communiqué. One of them was that the United States expressed its opposition to "any aggression" against the political independence and territorial integrity of Middle Eastern countries, and opposed "interference by any party in the affairs of countries in the region."

    Just three days after the publication of this joint communiqué, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles presented Israel with two "guarantees" as a condition for Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip: one was to forcibly "internationalize" Egypt's territorial waters in the Gulf of Aqaba, that is, to guarantee that Israeli ships could freely break through the Egyptian blockade. According to U.S. State Department officials, the specific U.S. approach was: first, "the United States will declare that it will exercise the right to free navigation in this Gulf"; second, the United States will send a merchant ship to open the way, and if Egypt prevents it, it will sue Egypt in the International Court of Justice in The Hague; third, as long as the United States itself "sets a precedent," it will "consider this waterway to have been internationalized." The other "guarantee" made by Dulles was that after Israeli troops leave the Gaza Strip, the United States will use its "influence" to have "a large number" of UN troops or observers stationed in the area. That is, UN troops will replace Israeli troops in occupying Egyptian territory.

    Without bias, the two "guarantees" of the American President and Secretary of State are in exactly opposite directions. One is to "guarantee" to the Arab countries that they will not be invaded or interfered with; the other is to "guarantee" to Israel, which invaded the Arab countries: the United States will personally come forward to interfere in Egypt and undermine its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In the words of the Egyptian "Republic Daily," this American guarantee shows that it "is more determined to be hostile to the Arabs than Israel." The Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States also questioned the U.S. State Department as to why the United States contradicted itself. According to Western news agencies, State Department officials were very "anxious" about this, and they urgently ordered the U.S. envoys in Spain to "explain" to the Saudi King on his way home, to convince him that he "had not been deceived."

    In fact, there is no need to "explain," people can see through the American reasoning. Its "guarantee" to the Arab countries is to promote the "Eisenhower Plan" and obtain military bases and oil resources in their territory. Naturally, it has to use some nice words as capital. As for the "guarantee" it made to Israel, it is to encourage Israel to be its tool of aggression and to use Israeli territory to serve American oil bosses. The United Press reported on the 13th that the reason why the United States is trying to forcibly "internationalize" the Gulf of Aqaba is "to establish another important oil transportation route through Israel in the Middle East."

    It seems that the United States "guarantees" this and "guarantees" that, but the general point is: they are all to "guarantee" its own aggressive interests. In order to seize aggressive interests, it can use any means. Isn't it? Dulles's series of "guarantees" to Israel declared to people that all the pleasant "guarantees" in Eisenhower's Middle East aggression plan are worthless. Therefore, the Egyptian "Al-Ahram" sighed with emotion on this matter: "Who would have expected that the United States would have fallen to such an evil and shameless point?" (Ping)

### 美国的两种“保证”

    美国的两种“保证”
    不久前沙特阿拉伯国王访问美国的时候，美国总统对阿拉伯国家说了许多“友好”的话，作了许多“保证”。这些“保证”还用联合公报的形式写在白纸上。其中一项是，美国表示它反对对中东国家的政治独立和领土完整的“任何侵犯”，反对“任何方面对这一地区各国事务的干涉”。
    这个联合公报发表后刚刚三天，美国国务卿杜勒斯就向以色列提出了一个作为以色列从加沙地带撤兵的交换条件的两点“保证”：一点是强使亚喀巴湾的埃及领海“国际化”，即保证以色列船只可以自由地突破埃及封锁线。据美国国务院官员证实，美国的具体做法是：头一步，“美国将宣布它要行使在这个湾自由通航的权利”；第二步，美国派一条商船去开路，如果埃及阻止，就向海牙国际法院控告埃及；第三步，只要美国自己“树立一个先例”，就将“认为这条水道已经国际化了”。杜勒斯所作的另一点“保证”是：在以色列军队离开加沙地带后，美国将用它的“影响”使这一地带驻扎“大量的”联合国部队或观察员。也就是由联合国部队来代替以色列部队占领埃及的领土。
    不偏不斜，美国总统和国务卿的两种“保证”，方向恰好相反。一个是向阿拉伯国家“保证”它们不受侵犯和不受干涉；另一个是向侵略阿拉伯国家的以色列“保证”：美国将亲自出马来干涉埃及，破坏它的主权和领土完整。用埃及“共和国报”的话来说：美国的这种保证显出它“比以色列更加坚决地想和阿拉伯人为敌”。沙特阿拉伯的驻美大使也向美国国务院提出了质问，为什么美国前言不对后语。据西方通讯社说，国务院官员为此很“着急”，他们已紧急命令驻西班牙美国使节，向归国途中的沙特国王进行“解释”，要他相信“并没有受到欺骗”。
    其实，用不着“解释”，人们也能看穿美国的道理。它向阿拉伯国家提出“保证”，为的是推销“艾森豪威尔计划”，取得它们领土上的军事基地和石油资源，自然得用一些好听的话做资本。至于它向以色列提出的“保证”，那是要鼓励以色列做它的侵略工具，并且利用以色列领土为美国石油老板服务。合众社在13日报道：美国之所以企图强使亚喀巴湾“国际化”，“目标是要在中东建立另外一条穿过以色列的重要的运油路线”。
    看来，美国“保证”来，“保证”去，总的一条：都是为了“保证”美国自己的侵略利益。它为了攫取侵略利益，可以不择任何手段。不是吗？杜勒斯向以色列的一通“保证”，就向人们宣告了艾森豪威尔的中东侵略计划中各种动听的“保证”都是一钱不值的。因此，埃及“金字塔报”对这件事慨叹地写道：“谁会料到美国竟然堕落到这样邪恶和无耻的地步呢？”　（平）
