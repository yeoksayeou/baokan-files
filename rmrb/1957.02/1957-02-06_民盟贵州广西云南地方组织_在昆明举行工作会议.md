Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 5th. The working conference of the Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan provincial local organizations of the China Democratic League (Minmeng) was held in Kunming from January 21st to 30th. Attending the meeting were leaders of the provincial local organizations and heads of grassroots organizations of the China Democratic League from the three provinces. Hu Yuzhi, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Fei Xiaotong, Standing Committee Member, and representatives from Sichuan Province also attended the meeting.

This meeting summarized the specific work experiences of the Minmeng organizations in the three provinces over the past year. In-depth discussions were held on three issues: how to implement the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," how to leverage the role of the Minmeng organization in promoting the march towards science, and how to effectively develop and consolidate the Minmeng organization.

Whether there is a contradiction between the need for democratic parties to have the leadership of the Communist Party and the mutual supervision between the various parties was one of the central topics of discussion at this meeting. The meeting held that accepting the leadership of the Party is the prerequisite for the democratic parties to play their role, and the process of mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is precisely a process of mutual improvement. Mutual supervision between parties can greatly improve the quality of work. In implementing the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" among the parties, both the Chinese Communist Party and the China Democratic League need to actively cooperate. In the past period, the Minmeng organization had carried out supervisory activities by making criticisms and suggestions to the Communist Party organizations and reflecting the opinions of the masses. In the future, members should eliminate concerns and boldly carry out mutual criticism with the attitude of masters.

The meeting held that promoting members to march towards science and helping them improve their professional skills is one of the important tasks of the Minmeng organization. The main members of the China Democratic League are intellectuals, and the ideological transformation of intellectuals must be carried out through professional practice. Therefore, the Minmeng organization must earnestly promote intellectuals to march towards science. The meeting also pointed out that members will inevitably encounter some subjective and objective difficulties on the road to marching towards science, and the Minmeng organization must support and encourage them to overcome these difficulties. The discussion also analyzed the superior conditions of the China Democratic League in carrying out this work: First of all, the Minmeng had a general understanding of intellectuals in the past and accumulated a lot of experience in this regard; secondly, the Minmeng itself has a considerable number of members who understand various businesses and can manage them.

The meeting also criticized the shortcomings of setting excessively high and strict requirements for new members and not paying attention to the requirements of intermediate and backward elements to join the League. The meeting held that with regard to the issue of expanding the Minmeng ranks, a positive attitude must be adopted in the future, and attention should be paid to the joining requirements of lecturers, teaching assistants, primary and secondary school teachers, people in the literary and art circles, and practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Political and ideological education of members within the League should also be strengthened.

During the meeting, the负责人 (fùzé rén) of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPC also exchanged views with the leading cadres of the Minmeng at all levels who attended the meeting.

    民盟贵州广西云南地方组织
    在昆明举行工作会议
    新华社昆明5日电　中国民主同盟贵州、广西、云南三省地方组织工作会议，从1月21日到30日在昆明举行。出席会议的有中国民主同盟三省地方组织领导人和基层组织的负责人。中国民主同盟中央秘书长胡愈之、常务委员费孝通和四川省的代表也参加了会议。
    这次会议总结了三省民盟组织近一年来的具体工作经验。对如何贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”方针、如何发挥民盟组织推动向科学进军的作用和怎样做好发展巩固盟的组织等三个问题，作了深入的讨论。
    民主党派需要共产党的领导，各党派又要互相监督，这是否矛盾？是这次会议讨论的中心内容之一。会议认为：接受党的领导是民主党派发挥作用的前提，共产党和民主党派互相监督的过程，正是大家相互提高的过程，党派之间通过相互监督能大大提高工作质量，在贯彻各党派“长期共存、互相监督”方针当中，中国共产党和中国民主同盟双方都需要积极合作。过去的一个时期，民盟组织曾通过向共产党组织提出批评建议、反映群众意见等方式进行了监督活动。今后，盟员更要消除顾虑，以主人翁的态度大胆开展相互间的批评。
    会议认为：推动盟员向科学进军、帮助他们提高业务水平是盟的组织重要工作内容之一。中国民主同盟的主要成员是知识分子，知识分子的思想改造必须通过业务实践来进行，因此盟的组织必须认真地推动知识分子向科学进军。会议还指出：盟员们在向科学进军的道路上，必然会遇到主观和客观的一些困难，盟的组织必须支持和鼓励他们克服这些困难。讨论中还分析了中国民主同盟在进行这项工作中的优越条件：首先，民盟过去对于知识分子一般有所了解，并在这方面积累了不少经验；其次，民盟本身就拥有相当数量懂得各种业务的盟员，可以管得起来。
    会上还批判了对新盟员条件要求过高、过严，不重视中间和落后分子的入盟要求等缺点。会议认为：对于扩大民盟队伍的问题，今后一定要采取积极的态度，要关心讲师、助教、中小学教员、文艺界、中西医等人的入盟要求。在盟内也要加强对盟员的政治思想教育。
    会议期间，中共云南省委员会负责人也曾和参加会议的民盟各级领导干部交换了意见。
