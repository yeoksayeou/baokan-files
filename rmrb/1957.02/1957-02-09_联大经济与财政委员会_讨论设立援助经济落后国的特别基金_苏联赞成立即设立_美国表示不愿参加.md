Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: According to TASS, New York, February 7th: The United States representative at the United Nations General Assembly Economic and Financial Committee, currently in session, stated that the United States is unwilling to participate in establishing a special United Nations fund to help economically underdeveloped countries develop their economies.

The UN General Assembly Economic and Financial Committee is currently discussing the establishment of this special fund. This issue has been discussed in the United Nations for five years.

U.S. President Eisenhower said in 1953 that the United States was studying the possibility of participating in such a fund. However, U.S. representative Hoffman, attending the Economic and Financial Committee, said this year that when the U.S. President made his statement in 1953, he hoped that international tensions would greatly ease around the world and that agreements would be reached on disarmament. However, because these hopes have not yet been realized, the United States is unwilling to join such a fund under the current circumstances.

The Polish representative said in his speech that the real reason for the United States taking such a position seems to be that it is unwilling to provide multilateral assistance to underdeveloped countries through the United Nations, but rather prefers to conclude bilateral agreements on the issue of "aid" to underdeveloped countries, which would facilitate the pursuit of its interests in those countries.

An editorial in the American "New York Times" also believes that it is hard to believe that a country that allocates $40 billion annually for military purposes cannot provide $75 million or $125 million to help underdeveloped countries.

Soviet representative Chernyashov emphasized that the Soviet Union supports the immediate establishment of a special fund for the development of underdeveloped countries, and that the Soviet Union is willing to participate in this fund. The main task of this fund must be to assist underdeveloped countries in developing their national economies, primarily their industries. This fund must be based on the equality of all countries and must be an independent agency of the United Nations, not subordinate to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as some countries have suggested.

    联大经济与财政委员会
    讨论设立援助经济落后国的特别基金
    苏联赞成立即设立　美国表示不愿参加
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约7日讯：美国代表在目前正在开会的联合国大会经济与财政委员会上表示，美国不愿意参加设立一项联合国特别基金来帮助经济不发达国家发展它们的经济。
    联合国大会经济与财政委员会目前正在讨论设立这项特别基金的问题。这个问题在联合国已经讨论了五年了。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔1953年曾经说过，美国正在研究参加这样一个基金的可能性。但是，出席经济与财政委员会的美国代表霍夫曼今年说，当美国总统在1953年发表他的声明时，他指望国际紧张局势会在全世界大大地缓和，并且指望在裁军方面达成协议。但是，因为这些希望至今尚未实现，在目前的情况下，美国不愿意加入这样一个基金。
    波兰代表在发言的时候说，美国采取这样一种立场的真正原因，似乎是它不愿意通过联合国对不发达国家提供多边的援助，而是愿意就“援助”不发达国家问题缔结双边协定，这样可以便于它在那些国家中追求它的利益。
    美国的“纽约时报”刊登的一篇社论也认为：每年为军事目的拨出四百亿美元的国家却不能为援助落后国家而提供七千五百万或一亿二千五百万美元，这一点是难以令人相信的。
    苏联代表切尔内晓夫着重指出，苏联赞成立即设立一笔特别基金以供开发不发达国家之用，而且苏联愿意参加这一基金。这一基金的主要任务必须是援助不发达国家，发展它们的国民经济，首先是发展它们的工业。这笔基金必须以一切国家平等为基础，它必须是联合国的一个独立机构，不能像某些国家所建议的那样隶属于国际复兴开发银行。
