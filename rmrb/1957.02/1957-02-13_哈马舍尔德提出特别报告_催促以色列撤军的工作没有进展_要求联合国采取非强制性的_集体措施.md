Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 12th: United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld issued a special report on February 11th regarding the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Egypt. The report stated that the Secretary-General's efforts to urge Israel to withdraw its troops in accordance with the United Nations General Assembly resolution have so far made no progress.

Hammarskjöld said that he had rejected Israel's request regarding the troop withdrawal issue, which was that the Secretary-General should ask Egypt to guarantee that it would not take any belligerent actions against Israel in the future. Hammarskjöld said that as long as Israel itself continues to take belligerent actions against Egypt, continues to militarily and administratively occupy the Gaza Strip, and continues to militarily occupy the Gulf of Aqaba region, he cannot make such a request to Egypt.

Hammarskjöld said that it remains doubtful whether Israel will comply with the United Nations General Assembly resolution demanding the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egypt.

Hammarskjöld emphasized that even if Israel obtained guarantees from Egypt that it would not take any belligerent actions after the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the Israeli representative only promised to state its attitude towards the outstanding issues based on Egypt's response. Hammarskjöld said that the Israeli government's lack of a clearer statement has complicated the attempts to implement the United Nations resolution.

Hammarskjöld disagreed with taking sanctions against Israel, believing that this would only add factors that would complicate the situation. He requested the United Nations General Assembly to give new instructions to his work and believed that the United Nations General Assembly could recommend “collective measures” that are not compulsory for member states.

Hammarskjöld's report will be discussed by the United Nations General Assembly in a day or two.

    哈马舍尔德提出特别报告
    催促以色列撤军的工作没有进展
    要求联合国采取非强制性的“集体措施”
    据新华社12日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德11日发表了关于以色列从埃及撤军问题的特别报告。报告说，秘书长根据联合国大会决议催促以色列撤军的工作到目前为止还没有取得进展。
    哈马舍尔德说，他已经拒绝了以色列就撤军问题提出的要求，这项要求是要秘书长要求埃及保证今后不对以色列采取任何交战行动。哈马舍尔德说，只要以色列自己还继续对埃及采取交战行动，继续在军事和民政方面占领加沙地带并且对亚喀巴湾地区实行军事占领，他就不能向埃及提出这样的要求。
    哈马舍尔德说，以色列是否会遵守联合国大会要求以色列军队撤出埃及的决议仍然是值得怀疑的。
    哈马舍尔德着重指出，即使以色列从埃及得到了在以色列军队撤退后埃及不采取任何交战行动的保证，以色列代表也只是答应根据埃及的答复来表明它对悬而未决的问题的态度。哈马舍尔德说，由于以色列政府没有比较明确地表明态度，因而使为了执行联合国决议而进行的尝试变得复杂。
    哈马舍尔德不同意对以色列采取制裁措施，认为这只会增加使局势复杂化的因素。他要求联合国大会对他的工作给予新的指示，并且认为联合国大会可以建议采取对会员国没有强制作用的“集体措施”。
    哈马舍尔德的报告将在一两天内由联合国大会讨论。
