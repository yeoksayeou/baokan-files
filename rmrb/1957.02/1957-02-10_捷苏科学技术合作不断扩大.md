Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 8th. The scope of scientific and technological cooperation between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union is continuously expanding, including the exchange of machine equipment design, engineering unit design, and production technology.

　　In 1948, only forty-five Czechoslovak experts went to the Soviet Union, and thirty-five experts came from the Soviet Union. But by 1956, the number of experts traveling between the two countries had increased to three hundred and eighty-four and three hundred and seventy-four respectively. In the cooperation, Czechoslovakia saved 1.25 million crowns (Czech currency) by using Soviet technology in the production of calendered bearings, and saved more than 1 million crowns worth of coking coal annually by using Soviet technology for smelting pig iron.

　　This year, the planning and design institutions of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union will also cooperate on several important tasks. This cooperation is especially suitable for the design of original machines and equipment, high-energy turbines, etc.

    捷苏科学技术合作不断扩大
    据新华社布拉格8日电　捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的科学和技术合作的范围正在不断扩大，合作的范围包括机器设备的设计、工程单位的设计和生产技术的交流等。
    在1948年，到苏联去的捷克斯洛伐克专家只有四十五人，从苏联来的专家有三十五人。但是到1956年，捷苏两国专家往来的人数已经分别增加到了三百八十四人和三百七十四人。在合作中，捷克斯洛伐克由于使用苏联在生产压延轴承中的技术而节约了一百二十五万克朗（捷币），由于使用苏联的冶炼生铁的技术而每年节约了价值一百多万克朗的焦煤。
    今年，捷苏两国的计划和设计机构还将在若干重要任务上共同合作。这种合作尤其适用于设计独创的机器和设备、高能的涡轮等。
