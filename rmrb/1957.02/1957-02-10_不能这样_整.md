You Can't "Rectify" Like This
　　By Our Reporter Gu Weijin

　　One early winter evening, Comrade Yang, the work team leader of Huangpi County's Huancheng Township, led the third production team of the Qunguang Agricultural Cooperative in holding a cooperative rectification meeting.

　　When it came to rectifying the cooperative, Comrade Yang had a clear idea in his mind: to promote democracy and let the masses offer opinions to the cadres to improve leadership; as for summarizing work and affirming the achievements of the cadres, that was secondary. What was there to boast about cadres doing a good job and achieving results! Besides, achievements in work were basically inseparable from the leadership of the Party, the support of the government, and the efforts of the masses.

　　Around seven o'clock, the cooperative members arrived at the meeting room one after another. Judging from the excited expressions of the members, Comrade Yang knew that the preparatory work before the meeting had been successful. Before the meeting, Comrade Yang heard that the members had three fears about offering opinions to the cadres: first, fear of retaliation; second, fear of embarrassment; third, fear that the opinions would not be changed. He resolutely supported the masses and put forward three guarantees: first, guarantee that the cadres would not hold the opinions in their hearts; second, guarantee that the cadres would not retaliate; third, guarantee that the cadres would correct their shortcomings and do a good job. In addition, he patiently cultivated a group of typical speakers who could offer opinions. He believed that this meeting would be a great success.

　　The cooperative members packed the meeting room, and everyone's eyes were focused on the production team leader, Jiang Zhenghong. Some members began to give him opinions all at once:

　　"In August, the daytime work was tight enough, but you still assigned work at night for watering, harvesting rice, pulling seedlings, and plowing fields, simply disregarding people's lives."

　　"You want to do two years' worth of work in one year; if we continue to work with you, we'll all die young!"

　　"If the quality of cultivation is even slightly poor, you deduct work points; isn't that being too strict?"

　　"Some people are unwilling to promote seed dressing with pesticides, and you threaten them with 'compensation for production losses'; what kind of work style is that!"

　　Jiang Zhenghong's long face flushed red, and he argued in his heart: What kind of opinions are these? For example, assigning work at night in August was to rush-plant mid-season rice; deducting work points for poor cultivation quality was the system of the management committee. He was very unconvinced and wanted to stand up and speak, but the deputy team leader, Li Dacheng, spoke for him:

　　"Offering opinions is good, but it must be based on facts and not be one-sided!"

　　"Then forget it, I won't offer any more," some members said, waving their hands.

　　The meeting place became quiet.

　　Comrade Yang was very anxious. He suddenly stood up, glared at Li Dacheng and Jiang Zhenghong, and said sternly:

　　"In order to promote democracy and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, every cadre must have a calm mind and listen to the opinions of the masses!" Then, turning to the members, he said: "Now it is democratic cooperative management, everyone is the master of their own affairs, don't keep your opinions in your hearts, boldly put them forward, the more you put them forward, the closer we become."

　　Thus, members who were usually somewhat dissatisfied with Jiang Zhenghong offered opinions one after another for three or four hours.

　　It was Jiang Zhenghong's turn to speak. His tall figure, with broad shoulders, leaned against the door. Comrade Yang glanced at him and quickly said:

　　"Be calm, be calm, no rebuttals allowed!"

　　Blood suddenly rushed to Jiang Zhenghong's cheeks, but he suppressed himself and said in a low voice:

　　"Everyone's opinions are very correct! I have put a lot of pressure on everyone this year, and there are problems with my work style, which need to be corrected in the future..."

　　After the meeting, the members walked towards the brightly lit houses in groups, talking and laughing. Jiang Zhenghong walked slowly behind them, his head dizzy and his heart heavy.

　　The night was so quiet. Jiang Zhenghong walked silently, recalling the situation of his leadership in production over the past year: during the spring famine, the members had no food or drink and did not work, so he led the members to engage in sideline production and carry out mutual borrowing and mutual aid; when the spring plowing began, he took the lead in promoting seed soaking and mixing and composite seedling fields; when it was dry and the japonica rice was infested with insects, he took the lead in watering to fight drought and eliminate insects; in order to improve management, he created experiences such as household contract work... Now that the autumn harvest is over, the average yield per mu is 1,021 jin of grain, and the average income per household is 430 yuan, more than double the income of the previous year. - He has done so much work in the past year, and even if there is no merit, there is hard work, but why don't people mention any of it? Why do they only give him a lot of opinions?

　　Jiang Zhenghong lay in bed, tossing and turning and unable to sleep. His eyes stared at the dark sky outside the window, thinking about the scene of being a team leader: every night, recording work, arranging work, and not going to bed until midnight; he always took the lead in doing the difficult tasks in the team; on rainy days, others stayed at home, but he had to go to check the rice fields; on snowy days, others did not go out, but he had to check on the five-guarantee households and the draft cattle. If the task was not completed, the management committee would criticize him; in order to complete the task, if he pushed a little harder, the masses would offer opinions. It was really like blocking water on both sides, and drowning in the middle. Alas, what's the point of continuing to be such a team leader!

　　Although Jiang Zhenghong thought this way all night, he still went to work as usual when it dawned. But the work was not easy to do. He sent the members to clear the ditches and drain the water in the wheat fields, and they said proudly: "Now it is democratic cooperative management, we don't care whether we do it or not." He sent Jiang Zhengxing to repair the car parts, and he shook his head and said: "Now everyone is the master of their own affairs, whether I go or not is up to me." Jiang Zhenghong felt a heat on his face. He knew that the members were violating labor discipline by doing this and should be criticized, but did he dare to criticize them? No! Now it is "mud falling into the crotch, whether it is shit or not, it is shit (indiscriminate)", so it is better to say a few words less.

　　From that day on, Jiang Zhenghong rarely asked about the team's work. He planned not to be the production team leader after the distribution settlement.

　　The production team lacked leadership, and many problems arose. Some grains were not threshed cleanly and were left at that, no one went to pick manure from the city, the wheat fields were not cleared of ditches and drained, some people did not work during the day and played cards and poker at night, and the attendance rate of the members dropped to 40%...

　　Since that evening when the cooperative rectification meeting was held, Comrade Yang was just about to summarize the experience when he suddenly heard the women's team leader, Fang Niannian, talk about the many problems that had occurred in Jiang Zhenghong and his production team, and he was immediately shocked. He thought, this cooperative is a key cooperative of the Huangpi County Party Committee, and this team's production performance in 1956 was the best in the entire cooperative, and it was awarded the title of model team. But now it has become like this. What to do? Then he thought of Jiang Zhenghong: an activist during the land reform period, who has been tempered by many struggles, why can't he stand it now that the masses have offered some opinions? He wanted to talk to Jiang Zhenghong, but it happened that Gao Qicai, the secretary of the Huangpi County Party Committee, and others came. After listening to Secretary Gao's talk, Comrade Yang realized that his cooperative rectification method was not correct - he could not one-sidedly mobilize the masses to give opinions to the cadres, he had to affirm the cadres' work achievements over the past year, and he had to draw a clear line between right and wrong....

　　The next day, Comrade Yang talked to Jiang Zhenghong, Jiang Zhenghong frowned, thinking that Comrade Yang was going to criticize him again. However, Comrade Yang sincerely reviewed the deviations of the last cooperative rectification meeting, affirmed his achievements in leading production over the past year, and pointed out that some of his shortcomings in work were inseparable from the weaknesses in the leadership of the management committee. He said: The members complain that the work is too tight, which is not entirely your responsibility, but that the management committee did not plan well in advance and then demanded completion within a limited time; the members have no small change to use, which is not because you have no plan, but because the cooperative's financial system is too rigid. ... Jiang Zhenghong heard this, stretched his brow, and blinked intimately. Comrade Yang continued:

　　"Of course, you yourself have some shortcomings in your work..."

　　"I also have shortcomings myself," Jiang Zhenghong interrupted, "I am impatient and have a harsh attitude. For example, I go to the fields with food in my mouth, and when I see others going to work a little slower, I scold them; sometimes women have special problems, and I force them to work; some people are unwilling to promote new technologies, and I threaten them with 'compensation for production losses,' which is actually a disguised form of coercion!" He paused and said: "In the past, I thought that I was wholeheartedly for work and had no shortcomings, but this time everyone gave me opinions, and I finally understood."

　　They ended the conversation happily. When Comrade Yang went deep into the members, he only heard many hardworking members discussing the current stagnation of production:

　　"In the past, a laborer did nine work points a day, but now they only do four or five work points. Hmph! Let's see what happens if this continues..."

　　"Less work, it's relaxing, but production has become a problem."

　　"If this continues, production will definitely be reduced, and no household will be able to get four or five hundred yuan!"

　　"Comrade Yang, this problem should be solved quickly."

　　Some members also told Comrade Yang what was in their hearts:

　　"It's good to give opinions to the team leader, but it's a bit too much."

　　"The team leader assigned work tightly, which was for everyone to earn more work points; otherwise, how could each laborer have done 280 workdays this year?"

　　"To be honest, this year we became a model team thanks to the leadership of the team leader. The team leader really can't be removed!"

　　Hearing these words, Comrade Yang felt very remorseful and sad. Comrade Yang learned a lesson from this incident, and he also conducted a "comprehensive view of cadres" education for the members. When the members discussed Jiang Zhenghong's role in production over the past year, their summary of him was "nine mores": more ways to overcome famine, more sideline production, more leading labor, more promotion of new technologies, more basic construction, more mobilization of the masses, more staying up late, more worrying, and more leadership in increasing production.

　　The members' representative meeting elected Jiang Zhenghong as the deputy director.

　　Jiang Zhenghong became active again. He and the members studied the issue of strengthening labor discipline and studied ways to improve the past undemocratic method of assigning work; he also led the members to restore the winter production work that had once been suspended.

### 不能这样“整”

    不能这样“整”	本报记者　古维进
    初冬的一个晚上，黄陂县环城乡工作组长杨同志领导群光农业社第三生产队开整社会议。
    提起整社，杨同志心里有一个底，那就是发扬民主，让群众对干部提意见，改进领导；至于总结工作，肯定干部的成绩，那是次要的。干部做好工作，取得成绩，有什么值得夸耀呢！何况工作有了成绩，基本上还是离不开党的领导，政府的扶持和群众的努力。
    约莫七点钟，社员陆续地来到会议室。从社员们兴奋的神情看来，杨同志知道会前的准备工作是成功的。会前，杨同志听到社员对干部提意见有三怕：一、怕报复；二、怕情面难堪；三、怕说了不改。他坚决给群众撑腰，提出了三保证：一、保证干部不把意见放在心里；二、保证干部不报复；三、保证干部改正缺点，做好工作。此外，他还耐心地培养了一批提意见的典型发言人。他相信这次会议会开得很好。
    社员把会议室挤得满满的，人们的目光都集中在生产队长姜正洪的身上。一些社员七嘴八舌地给他提意见了：
    “八月间，白天的活儿够紧啦，可是，晚上你还派工车水、割谷、扯秧、犁田，简直是不顾人们的死活。”
    “你是想一年做完两年的活呢，跟你一块干下去，非短寿不可！”
    “耕作质量差一点点，就要扣除工分，未免卡得太死了。”
    “有些人不愿意推广药剂拌种，你就用‘赔产’来威胁，这是什么作风！”
    姜正洪的长脸孔升起红潮，心里在和人争辩着：这是些什么意见呢？比方说，八月间连夜派工做活，那是为了抢种中稻；对耕作质量不好的扣工分，那是管理委员会的制度。他心里很不服气，想站起来发言了，恰好副队长李大成代他说了话：
    “提意见要得，可是，要实事求是，不要片面！”
    “那就算了，不提了。”有几个社员把手一挥说。
    会场变得静悄悄了。
    杨同志非常焦急。他霍地立起来，瞪了李大成和姜正洪一眼，严正地说：
    “为了发扬民主，调动群众的积极因素，每一个干部都要有冷静的头脑，倾听群众的意见！”接着，把脸转向社员说：“现在是民主办社，大家当家作主，有意见不要放在心里，大胆提出来吧，越提越亲热。”
    于是，平日对姜正洪有点不满的社员，一个接着一个的提了三四个钟头的意见。
    轮到姜正洪发言了。他高高的个子，宽阔的肩膀斜倚在门上。杨同志向他瞟了一眼，连忙说：
    “要冷静、冷静，不准反驳！”
    血猛然涌上了姜正洪的脸颊，但是他压抑了自己，低声说：
    “大家提的意见都很对！一年来我对大家有许多压迫，我的作风有问题，今后需要改正……”
    散会以后，社员三五成群地说着笑着向灯光闪动的屋子走去。姜正洪一个人在后头慢慢地走着，他头昏脑胀，心里闷沉沉。
    夜是这样的寂静。姜正洪默默地走着，想起了一年来自己领导生产的情形：春荒期间，社员没有吃喝不出工，他领导社员搞副业生产，开展互借互济；春耕生产开始了，他带头推广浸种拌种和合式秧田；天旱了，粳稻生了虫，他带头车水抗旱、除虫；为了改进管理工作，他创造了联户包工等经验……现在秋收结束，平均亩产粮食一千零二十一斤，平均每户收入四百三十元，比前年增加收入一倍多。——一年来做了这许多工作，没有功劳也有苦劳，可是，人们为什么提都不提呢？为什么单单给自己提了一大堆意见呢？
    姜正洪躺在床上，翻来复去地睡不着。眼睛凝视着窗外黑漆的天空，想着当队长的情景：每天晚上，记工、排工，搞到半夜才睡觉；队里不好干的活，总是自己带头干；落雨天，别人呆在家里，自己要去看秧水；下雪天，别人不出门，自己要去检查五保户和耕牛。任务完不成，管理委员会要批评；为了完成任务，抓得紧一点，群众就提意见。真是两头拦住水，中间淹死人。唉，这样的队长干下去还有什么意思呢！
    姜正洪虽然这样想了一夜，天亮的时候，还是照常去工作。但是工作不好做了。他派社员去麦田清沟排水，他们神气地说：“现在是民主办社，我们干不干，你莫操心。”派姜正兴去修整车子零件，他摇头说：“现在大家当家作主，去不去，由我喜欢。”姜正洪感到脸孔一阵热辣辣的。他知道社员这样做是违反劳动纪律，应该批评，但是，敢批评吗？不！如今是“黄泥巴落到裤裆里，不是屎也是屎（是非不分）”，还是少说几句吧。
    从这一天起，姜正洪不大过问队里的工作了。他打算在分配决算以后，不当生产队长了。
    生产队缺乏领导，出了许多问题。有些谷子没有打净就了事，城里的粪没有人去挑，麦田没有清沟排水，有些人白天不干活，夜里抹牌、打扑克，社员出勤率降到40％……。×××
      自从那天晚上开过整社会议以后，杨同志正想把经验加以总结，忽然听到妇女队长方年年谈到姜正洪和他的生产队发生了许多问题，当下吃了一惊。他想，这个社是中共黄陂县委的重点社，这个队1956年的生产成绩在全社最好，荣获了模范队的称号。可是，现在搞成这个样子。怎么办呢？随后他又想到姜正洪这个人：土地改革时期的积极分子，经过多少斗争锻炼，现在为什么群众提了点意见就受不了呢？他想找姜正洪谈话，恰好中共黄陂县委书记高起才等来了。听了高书记的谈话，杨同志才明了自己的整社方法不对头——不能片面的发动群众给干部提意见，要肯定干部一年来的工作成绩，要划清是非界限……。
    第二天，杨同志找姜正洪谈话，姜正洪紧皱着眉，以为杨同志又要批评他了。但是，杨同志诚恳地检讨了上次整社会议的偏差，肯定了他一年来领导生产的成绩，指出他在工作上有些缺点是和管理委员会领导上的弱点分不开的。他说：社员埋怨活路做得太紧，不完全是你的责任，是管理委员会事前计划不周，事后又要限期完成；社员没有零钱用，不是你没有板眼，是社里的财务制度定得太死。……姜正洪听到这里，舒展眉头，亲热地?了?眼睛。杨同志继续说：
    “当然，你自己在工作上……”
    “我自己也有缺点。”姜正洪截住说：“我脾气急燥，态度生硬。比方，我是嘴里含着饭就上地的，看见别人出工慢一些，就掉下脸把人批评一顿；有时妇女有特殊问题，也逼着非出工不可；有的人不愿推广新技术，我就用‘赔产’作威胁，实际上是变相的强迫命令！”他顿了顿，又说：“以前我认为自己是忠心耿耿为了工作，没得缺点，这回大家给我提了意见，才明白过来了。”
    他们愉快地结束了谈话。当杨同志深入到社员中的时候，只听得许多勤劳的社员对当前生产陷于停顿状态议论纷纷：
    “从前一个劳力一天做九分工，现在只做了四五分工。哼！这样下去瞅着吧……”
    “少出工，清闲倒是清闲，可是，生产成问题了。”
    “这样下去保险减产，一户休想分到四五百元了！”
    “杨同志，应该赶快解决这个问题。”
    有的社员还给杨同志说出了心里话：
    “给队长提意见要得，就是过火了一些。”
    “队长派活紧，那是为了大家多挣工分；要不，今年每个劳动力哪能做到二百八十个劳动日。”
    “说实话，今年成了模范队，多亏队长的领导。队长真是退不得呀！”
    听了这些话，杨同志心中很懊悔，难过。杨同志从这件事中接受了教训，他也向社员进行了“全面看干部的教育。当社员们讨论姜正洪一年来在生产中的作用的时候，大家给他作的总结是“九多”：渡荒办法多，副业搞得多，带头劳动多，推广新式技术多，基本建设多，发动群众多，熬夜多，操心多，领导增产多。
    社员代表大会选举姜正洪为副主任。
    姜正洪又积极起来了。他和社员一起研究了加强劳动纪律的问题，研究了改进过去派活不民主的办法；他又领导着社员恢复了一度停顿的冬季生产工作。
