	Inner Mongolia's Experience in Implementing the Socialist Transformation of Animal Husbandry

With the progress of the socialist transformation across the country, how to carry out the socialist transformation in pastoral areas where ethnic minorities live is an important issue of concern. A few days ago, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, and asked him to introduce the situation of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia and the basic experiences that have been obtained.

The person in charge of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China first pointed out that the economic transformation of the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia is carried out in accordance with the policy determined by the Party Central Committee. This policy is: "Rely on the laboring herdsmen, unite all forces that can be united, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of animal husbandry on the basis of stabilizing and developing animal husbandry production." Practice has proved that this policy is in line with the economic characteristics of animal husbandry in pastoral areas and the actual conditions of pastoral society. In 1956, Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas conscientiously implemented the above-mentioned policy, on the one hand, promoted the healthy development of the animal husbandry cooperation movement, and at the same time achieved a steady increase in animal husbandry production. By the end of the year, more than 18,000 households of Mongolian, Daur, and Solon ethnic herdsmen in Inner Mongolia had joined cooperatives, and more than 59,000 households of herdsmen had participated in various types of mutual aid teams. In the whole autonomous region, the number of herdsmen households participating in cooperatives accounted for 22% of the total number of herdsmen households, and together with those participating in mutual aid teams, the organized herdsmen households accounted for 83% of the total number of herdsmen households. The vast majority of these mutual aid and cooperation organizations increased production, and the lives of herdsmen were further improved. The number of large and small livestock in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia increased by nearly 1.1 million head in the past year. The current number of livestock is 54.5% higher than in 1952.

When talking about the specific issues of implementing the policy of economic transformation in pastoral areas, the person in charge said that Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has gained some useful experiences and lessons in this regard in the past year. Last spring, affected by the high tide of the socialist revolution across the country and the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in the autonomous region, herdsmen of all ethnic groups eagerly demanded to carry out the animal husbandry cooperation movement. At this time, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized that the transformation of the individual herdsmen economy was to better develop animal husbandry production, and the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit must be adhered to in the transformation. Based on this principle, before establishing pastoral cooperatives, various localities repeatedly publicized the Party's general line in the transition period to the herdsmen, explained the policies, policies and methods of animal husbandry cooperation, and publicized the superiority of cooperation, so that the herdsmen had full ideological preparation. At the same time, party committees and governments at all levels strengthened the leadership of various types of mutual aid teams, making mutual aid teams the basis for establishing cooperatives. On the basis of the original mutual aid teams, various pastoral areas conducted pilot projects for establishing cooperatives, set examples, and explored some experiences in establishing cooperatives. After the establishment of pastoral cooperatives, the state continued to provide assistance in training technical personnel, preventing and controlling livestock diseases, building settlements, and developing feed bases. In this way, a batch of elementary animal husbandry production cooperatives were born.

After the establishment of pastoral cooperatives, the importance of solving the issue of mutual benefit became more and more obvious. Facts have proved that pastoral cooperatives must pay special attention to the principle of mutual benefit in handling livestock entry into the cooperative and income distribution. At present, the livestock entry methods widely used in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas are "basic female livestock entering the cooperative, proportional profit sharing" and "grading and scoring, entering the cooperative by points, proportional profit sharing," etc. The distribution ratio is based on the actual situation of the local area, taking into account the income of both labor and livestock. Many pastoral cooperatives have implemented these methods, which are not only easy for herdsmen to understand and accept, but also make both households with more labor and less livestock and households with more livestock and less labor feel satisfied, which is conducive to unity within the cooperative and the consolidation of the cooperative. However, in individual pastoral cooperatives, there have also been phenomena of blindly pursuing advanced methods regardless of conditions, resulting in the violation of the wishes of the herdsmen and causing chaos in the work of the cooperative.

Another important issue of livestock entering the cooperative is that the members' needs for riding, food, and self-retained livestock must be properly taken care of. Livestock in pastoral areas are very different from land in rural areas. Livestock are not only the means of production for herdsmen, but also their means of livelihood. Generally, pastoral cooperatives in Inner Mongolia have paid attention to leaving members with riding horses, dairy livestock, meat livestock, draught livestock for transportation, beloved livestock, and livestock for sacrifices, so the herdsmen are very satisfied. However, some pastoral cooperatives once ignored this characteristic and tightened the self-retained livestock of the members, making the members' lives inconvenient and affecting their work mood.

Doing a good job in management is the main link in consolidating pastoral cooperatives. The management policy of Inner Mongolia's pastoral cooperatives is: focusing on animal husbandry, appropriately combining agricultural and sideline production, and developing diversified operations. At present, pastoral cooperatives in various localities have gradually established labor organizations, formulated simple labor quotas, stipulated labor remuneration, and established simple and easy-to-implement financial management and accounting systems. When establishing labor organizations and labor remuneration systems, various localities paid attention to adopting various simple and easy-to-implement contracting methods. Experience has proved that this method is easy for the masses to understand and willing to accept, and is a better way to correctly combine collective interests and individual interests. Because the labor force is used more reasonably within the cooperative, the members are working hard to improve the methods of livestock feeding and management, improve grazing techniques, and begin to build feed bases and carry out sideline production.

The person in charge said that through the above-mentioned measures, the existing 543 pastoral cooperatives in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have achieved increased production in the vast majority last year. When distributing income in winter, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward several principles to various pastoral areas: requiring to ensure that households with more livestock and less labor and households with more labor and less livestock can get reasonable benefits in the distribution, requiring 80% to 90% of the animal husbandry income to be distributed to the members, and ensuring that the vast majority of members, and striving for all members, can increase their income. Judging from the current situation, most of these requirements have been achieved by the cooperatives. In the distribution of cooperatives, there have also been some biases. For example, some places have the egalitarian idea of "cutting fat to make up for thinness," which will make some herdsmen suffer losses, and the party committee has issued a notice to various localities to pay close attention to correcting it.

When the reporter asked: According to the specific situation of Inner Mongolia, what kind of form, development speed and scale should the pastoral cooperatives have? The person in charge said that at present, in the Inner Mongolia region, since the pastoral cooperatives have not been established for long and lack experience, generally only elementary cooperatives are established, and advanced cooperatives are not advocated. When considering the speed of cooperation, they first consider whether it can increase production, which is the fundamental issue. The speed of animal husbandry cooperation should be determined by whether the development trend of animal husbandry production is stable, and different speeds should be proposed according to different regions. For example, in pastoral areas with a better mutual aid foundation and various conditions, the speed can be slightly faster, otherwise it is better to slow down to avoid unnecessary losses. According to the current situation in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas, some more can be developed this year on the basis of consolidating the existing batch of pastoral cooperatives.

Talking about the scale of pastoral cooperatives, he said that the current average scale of existing cooperatives in Inner Mongolia is 34 households, and most of the cooperatives are suitable for the situation in pastoral areas. The scale of a small number of cooperatives is a bit larger, and they are being rectified. Due to the vastness of the pastoral areas, the dispersed residence, and the poor conditions of cadres, the scale of pastoral cooperatives is generally suitable for 10 to 20 households in nomadic areas, with a maximum of no more than 30 households, and generally 20 to 30 households in settled areas, with a maximum of no more than 40 households.

The person in charge also talked to the reporter about the issue of transforming the pastoral owner economy. He said that in 1956, the autonomous region piloted 13 joint state-private ranches and absorbed 12 pastoral owners to participate in pastoral cooperatives. These are new ways to transform the pastoral owner economy and are welcomed by the pastoral owners. According to experience, in the initial stage of establishing ranches and joining cooperatives, the party committee and government must repeatedly explain the policies to the pastoral owners, fully consult, eliminate their concerns, and properly resolve economic issues such as clearing assets and determining prices. It will only be done if the consultation agrees, and it will not be done if it does not agree. The Party's policy of no struggle, no division, no class division, and mutual benefit for both herdsmen and pastoral owners in pastoral areas will continue to be implemented. The purpose of transforming the pastoral owner economy is to develop production, so the method of transformation should be freely chosen by the pastoral owners. They can run joint state-private ranches, join cooperatives, or put out "Suluke" (Mongolian, meaning renting out livestock); if they do not want any of these methods, they can also hire workers to operate themselves. The state also provides assistance to pastoral owners who have difficulties in production. At present, the pastoral owners in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas who have participated in joint state-private ranches and pastoral cooperatives have received reasonable interest economically, are taken care of in taxation, and have more self-retained livestock. They also have a political status. They serve as directors and deputy directors of joint state-private ranches and receive the same treatment as state cadres. The pastoral owners' enthusiasm for management has been improved, and this part of the economy will also steadily rise along the road of socialist transformation.

Finally, the religious issue was discussed. The person in charge pointed out that in the socialist transformation of animal husbandry and in the future, they will continue to implement the Party and government's policy of protecting freedom of religious belief. Whether people participating in cooperatives or joint state-private ranches have freedom of religious belief, and no one shall interfere. The policy of protecting the livestock of the temples will continue to be implemented. Those who are willing to operate themselves can operate themselves, and those who are willing to put out "Suluke" can continue to put out "Suluke." The government will also provide relief to lamas who have difficulties in life.

    内蒙古畜牧业实行社会主义改造的经验	新华社记者　石云子
    随着全国社会主义改造工作的进展，在少数民族聚居的牧业区如何进行社会主义改造工作，是人们关心的一个重要问题。前几天，记者特地访问了中共内蒙古自治区委员会负责人，请他介绍内蒙古牧业区实行畜牧业社会主义改造的情况和已经取得的基本经验。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会负责人首先指出：内蒙古牧业区的经济改造，是根据党中央确定的方针进行的。这个方针就是：“依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可以团结的力量，在稳定发展畜牧业生产的基础上，逐步地实现对畜牧业的社会主义改造。”实践结果证明，这个方针是符合牧区畜牧业经济特点和牧区社会的实际情况的。1956年，内蒙古牧区认真贯彻执行了上述方针，一方面使畜牧业合作化运动健康地发展起来，同时又做到畜牧业生产的稳步上升。到年底，内蒙古已有一万八千多户蒙古、达呼尔、索伦等民族牧民加入了合作社，并有五万九千多户牧民参加各种类型的互助组。全自治区参加合作社的牧户，占总牧户的22％，连同参加互助组的牧户，组织起来的牧户占牧户总数的83％。这些互助合作组织，绝大部分增加了生产，牧民生活得到进一步的改善。内蒙古牧区的大小牲畜，去年一年内净增加将近一百一十万头。现有牲畜头数比1952年增加了54.5％。
    在谈到贯彻执行牧区经济改造方针的具体问题的时候，这位负责人说：一年来，内蒙古自治区在这方面获得了一些有益的经验和教训。去年春天，内蒙古牧区受到全国社会主义革命高潮和自治区内农业、手工业、资本主义工商业社会主义改造高潮的影响，各族牧民迫切要求开展畜牧业合作化运动。这个时候，中共内蒙古自治区委员会强调对个体牧民经济的改造，就是为了更好地发展畜牧业生产，改造中必须坚持自愿互利原则。根据这个原则，各地在举办牧业社以前，曾经反复地向牧民宣传党在过渡时期的总路线，解释畜牧业合作化的方针、政策和办法，并且宣传合作化的优越性，使牧民有了充分的思想准备。同时，各地党委和政府加强对各类互助组的领导，使互助组成为办社的基础。在原有互助组的基础上，各牧区进行了建社试点，作出榜样，摸索出一些办社经验。牧业社建立后，国家又在培养技术人员、防治牲畜疫病、建设定居地和开辟饲料基地等方面不断给以扶助。这样，一批初级的畜牧业生产合作社就诞生了。
    牧业社建立以后，解决互利问题的重要性越来越明显了。事实证明，牧业社在处理牲畜入社和收益分配工作上，必须特别重视互利原则。目前内蒙古牧区大量采用的牲畜入社办法是“基础母畜入社、比例分益”和“按等评分、以分入社、比例分益”等。分配比例是从当地实际情况出发，照顾劳、畜两方的收益。许多牧业社实行了这些办法，不仅容易为牧民了解、接受，而且使劳力多牲畜少的户和牲畜多劳力少的户都感到满意，有利于社内团结和社的巩固。但是在个别的牧业社里，也曾出现过不顾条件，急躁冒进，追求高级办法的现象，结果是违背了牧民意愿，造成社内工作混乱。
    牲畜入社的另一个重要问题是：必须妥善地照顾社员乘骑、饮食等生活需要和自留牲畜的要求。牧区的牲畜同农村的土地大不相同，牲畜不但是牧民的生产资料，又是他们的生活资料。内蒙古一般牧业社已注意给社员留下乘马、奶畜、肉畜、运输用的役畜、心爱的牲畜、祭祀用的牲畜等，这样，牧民都很满意。可是有些牧业社一度忽视这个特点，对社员自留牲畜扣得偏紧，使社员生活感觉不方便，影响劳动情绪。
    作好经营管理，是巩固牧业社的主要环节。内蒙古牧业社的经营方针是：以牧为主，适当结合农副业生产，发展多种经营。现在，各地牧业社已逐步建立劳动组织，制定简单的劳动定额，规定劳动报酬，建立简单易行的财务管理和会计制度。在建立劳动组织和劳动报酬制度时，各地注意采用了各种简单易行的包工办法。经验证明，这种办法群众容易理解，乐于接受，是使集体利益和个人利益正确结合的一种较好的办法。由于社内使用劳动力比较合理，社员们正在努力改进牲畜饲养管理方法，提高放牧技术，并且开始建设饲料基地，进行副业生产。
      这位负责人说，经过上述各项措施，内蒙古自治区现有的五百四十三个牧业社，去年绝大多数做到了增加生产。在冬天进行收益分配时，中共内蒙古自治区委员会对各牧区提出了几项原则：要求保证在分配中做到牲畜多劳力少、劳力多牲畜少的户都能得到合理的利益，要求占牧业收入中的80％到90％分配给社员，保证绝大多数社员、争取所有社员都能增加收入。照目前情况看来，这些要求大部分合作社已经做到了。在合作社分配中，也曾发生过一些偏向。例如有的地方存在着“割肥补瘦”的平均主义分配思想，这就会使一部分牧民吃亏，党委已通报各地严密注意纠正。
      当记者问到：根据内蒙古具体情况，牧业社的形式、发展速度和规模应该怎样才合适？这位负责人说，目前在内蒙古地区，由于牧业社举办不久，经验不足，一般还只办初级社，不提倡办高级社。他们在考虑合作化的速度时，首先考虑的是能否增加生产这一根本问题。畜牧业合作化速度快慢，要看畜牧业生产发展趋势是否稳定来决定，同时还要依据不同地区提出不同速度。例如在互助基础较好、各种条件具备的牧区可以稍快些，否则宁可放慢，以避免不必要的损失。按照内蒙古牧区当前情况，今年在巩固原有这批牧业社基础上，还可以再发展一些。
    谈到牧业社的规模，他说，目前内蒙古现有社的规模平均是三十四户，大多数社是适合牧区情况的。少数社的规模是大了些，正在进行整顿。由于牧区辽阔，居住分散，干部条件还差等原因，牧业社规模一般在游牧区以十到二十户，最多不超过三十户为宜，定居区一般以二十到三十户，不超过四十户为宜。
    这位负责人还同记者谈到了对牧主经济的改造问题。他说，1956年，自治区试办了十三座公私合营牧场，吸收十二户牧主参加了牧业社。这些都是改造牧主经济的新办法，受到牧主们的欢迎。根据经验看来，在建场、入社的初期，党委和政府必须反复向牧主交代政策，充分协商，消除他们顾虑，并且妥善解决清产核资、估产作价等经济问题。协商同意才办，不同意就不办。党在牧区的不斗不分、不划阶级和牧工牧主两利政策，仍然继续执行。改造牧主经济的目的是为了发展生产，因此改造的办法应由牧主自由选择，可以办合营牧场，可以入合作社，可以放“苏鲁克”（蒙语，租放牲畜之意）；如果对这些办法都不愿意，也可以自己雇工经营。牧主在生产上有困难，国家还给予帮助。现在，内蒙古牧区已经参加合营牧场和牧业社的牧主，经济上得到了合理的利息，税收上受到照顾，并且拥有较多的自留牲畜。政治上也有地位，他们担任着合营牧场场长、副场长等职务，受到同国家干部同样的待遇。牧主们经营的情绪有了提高，这部分经济也将沿着社会主义改造的道路稳步上升。
    最后谈到了关于宗教问题。这位负责人指出：在畜牧业社会主义改造中和今后，他们仍然坚持贯彻党和政府关于保护宗教信仰自由的政策，无论参加合作社或参加合营牧场的人，都有信教自由，任何人不得加以干涉。对于召庙的牲畜，仍然坚持保护的政策，愿意自己经营的，可以自己经营，愿意放“苏鲁克”的，可以继续放“苏鲁克”。喇嘛生活有困难的，政府还要救济。
