Introducing "The Complete Works of Marx and Engels," Volume One
Zhang Zhongshi

I

"The Complete Works of Marx and Engels," Volume One, has been published in Chinese based on the Russian second edition.

The Complete Works of Marx and Engels is divided into thirty volumes. Volume One includes some of the most important early works of Marx and Engels, divided into two parts: The first part includes sixteen works written by Marx from 1842 to 1844, including: "Comments on the Latest Prussian Censorship Instructions," debates on freedom of the press and the law on theft of wood at the Sixth Rhine Province Assembly (two articles), "Justification of the Correspondent from the Mosel," "Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right," "On the Jewish Question," "Introduction to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right," and "Review of 'The King of Prussia and Social Reform' by a 'Prussian'" and others; the second part includes fifteen works written by Engels from 1839 to 1844, including: "Letters from the Wupper Valley," "Review of Alexander Jung's 'Lectures on Modern German Literature'," "Letters from England" (four articles), "The Progress of Social Reform on the Continent," "Outline of a Critique of Political Economy," "The Condition of England" (three articles), and others. These works were all written before the two began working together.

The 1830s and 1840s were a period in which class contradictions in European countries became increasingly acute and revolutionary movements became increasingly mature. During this period, revolutions broke out in many countries, such as France, England, Belgium, Poland, Italy, and Spain. Some of these revolutions were struggles by the masses of the people against feudalism; others were struggles in which the proletariat had stepped onto the historical stage and began to oppose the capitalist system of exploitation. In 1848-1849, a revolutionary storm swept across Europe.

During the late 1830s and early 1840s, Germany was on the eve of a bourgeois revolution. The center of the European revolutionary movement had shifted to Germany. Influenced by the revolutionary movements in other European countries, social life in Germany became increasingly active. The bourgeoisie and intellectuals successively established many literary and philosophical groups, using discussions of philosophical issues and criticisms of religion to carry out struggles against the Prussian monarchy, serfdom, and the police state.

The period from 1839 to 1844 was the youth of Marx and Engels, the years in which their worldviews and political views were formed. At this time, both had actively participated in Germany's ideological struggle and important political events, keenly responding to some of the pressing issues raised by the process of German social development. But in terms of political views, both were initially revolutionary democrats, resolutely opposed to the feudal autocracy and reactionary ideas that still dominated Germany. In philosophy, because Hegel's theory dominated German philosophy at the time, both were initially followers of Hegel, standing on the position of Hegel's idealism. However, both were dissatisfied with the conservative and reactionary views of this theory, its disregard for the economic and political interests of the masses, and its hostility to revolution and democracy, and they criticized it. In the actual ideological and political struggle, the two gradually turned from idealism to materialism, and from revolutionary democracy to communism.

The works included in Volume One vividly and profoundly reflect the rich content of German historical development during this period. These works clearly show the process of the formation of Marx's and Engels' worldviews, showing how they turned from idealism to materialism, and from revolutionary democracy to communism. Moreover, these works also clearly show that Marx and Engels had the characteristics of combining scientific attitude and revolutionary spirit from the time they stepped onto the political stage. From these works, it can be seen that in order to answer the questions raised by the social life and the struggle of the masses at that time, they carried out enormous scientific work, critically studied all the achievements created by previous thinkers, and thus turned to scientific communism.

Therefore, the works included in Volume One are not only important historical materials for studying the formation of the Marxist worldview, but also the theoretical wealth of the working people of the whole world.

II

In the early 1840s, one of the pressing issues in Germany at that time was the issue of freedom of the press. Marx's struggle for democratic freedom and against the monarchy and German feudal forces began with exposing the Prussian press law and censorship system. His first political article, "Comments on the Latest Prussian Censorship Instructions," marked the beginning of this struggle. In this article, Marx sharply criticized the Prussian reactionary censorship system, demanding the abolition of this censorship system and the implementation of freedom of the press.

In early January 1842, bourgeois radicals in the Rhineland region who were in contact with the Hegelian Leftists founded the "Rheinische Zeitung" in Cologne. This newspaper was a national publication in Germany. Marx, who was living in Bonn at the time, and Bruno Bauer, a Hegelian Leftist, were hired as the main journalists of the newspaper. In October, Marx became the editor-in-chief and moved to Cologne. After Marx became the editor-in-chief, the revolutionary democratic trend of the newspaper became increasingly obvious, and it became a fighting publication for radical intellectuals. By March 1843, the newspaper was closed down. The "Rheinische Zeitung" was an important milestone in the lives and activities of Marx and Engels and in the development of their political views. Marx's "Debate on Freedom of the Press..." to "Justification of the Correspondent from the Mosel" and other eight articles were published in this newspaper. "Debate on Freedom of the Press...", "Editorial of 'Cologne Daily' No. 179", "The Sealing of the 'Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung'" and other articles insisted on freedom of the press, exposed the class nature of the Rhine Provincial Assembly and its subservience to the feudal aristocracy and feudal land ownership, thereby criticizing feudal privileges and the entire feudal system. It is worth pointing out that in the article "The Sealing of the 'Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung'," Marx also contrasted it with the people's newspaper when exposing the reactionary newspapers that spread rumors and lies. What is the people's newspaper? Marx said: "It lives among the people, it sincerely shares the joys and sorrows of the people, shares the same love and hatred" (translated copy page 187). The articles "Debate on the Law on Theft of Wood" and "Justification of the Correspondent from the Mosel" exposed the reactionary measures of the Prussian government and the Rhine Provincial Assembly to protect the interests of the aristocratic class, and defended the economic interests of the working people.

The writing of these papers was of great significance for the formation of Marx's worldview and political views. According to Marx himself, his work at the "Rheinische Zeitung" prompted him to study the material life of society, which made him feel that his economic knowledge was insufficient, thus prompting him to study economic relations, and further to study socialism (see "Preface to the Critique of Political Economy"). From some of the papers published in the "Rheinische Zeitung", it can be seen that Marx had begun to shift from idealism to materialism, and from revolutionary democracy to communism.

"Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right" was written by Marx in the summer of 1843, and Marx had not published it during his lifetime. The full text has not been completed, and the first few pages of the manuscript have been lost. The part now published was first published by the Marx-Lenin Institute of the Central Committee of the CPSU in 1927 based on the original manuscript. This is the first step Marx took in order to solve the "difficulties that agitated him" (see "Preface to the Critique of Political Economy"). In this book, he made a detailed critique and analysis of sections 261-313 of Hegel's "Principles of the Philosophy of Right," namely the article on the state issue, calling on philosophers to criticize politics and law, and to criticize the existing system. This book is an important stage in Marx's transition from idealism to materialism. Marx himself later said that this research work led him to the conclusion that: "Legal relations, like the forms of state, cannot be understood from themselves, nor from the so-called general development of the human spirit; on the contrary, they are rooted in material life relations, Hegel, following the example of the 18th-century British and French writers, called the sum of these relations 'civil society,' and the anatomy of civil society should be sought in political economy." (See "Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Volume One, Chinese translation, page 340)

Marx saw that it was impossible to propagate his views under the conditions of Prussian feudal autocracy and police tyranny, so he went to Paris at the end of October 1843. In Paris, he and Arnold Ruge co-founded a magazine, "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher," which was originally scheduled to be published once a month, but the publication only published a combined issue (February and March 1844) and was discontinued due to difficulties in secret distribution in Germany and disagreements with Ruge. Letters from "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher," "On the Jewish Question," "Introduction to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right" and other articles were published in this publication. The historical significance of this magazine lies in the fact that Marx showed in it that he had finally turned to materialism and communism, and became an advanced representative of revolutionary materialist philosophy and scientific communism.

Letters from "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher" are three letters from Marx to Ruge. In these letters, Marx criticized the socialist theories of previous generations, believing that these theories were divorced from reality and were dogmatic, and advocated combining the criticism of the old social theories with political and practical struggles. He said: "In this case, we do not stand as empty theorists, holding a set of ready-made new principles in our hands and shouting to the world: the truth is here, kneel down to it! We are developing new principles for the world from the principles of the world itself." (translated copy page 418)

"On the Jewish Question" is an article criticizing two articles on the Jewish question written by Bruno Bauer. Bauer discussed the issue of the Jews entirely from a theological point of view, believing that Jews could only gain freedom by abandoning their religion, because the Christian state could not liberate the Jews due to its own religious nature, and the Jews could not be liberated due to their own religious nature. If Christians and Jews want to gain freedom, they must abandon religion, but Christianity is superior to Judaism. Therefore, in his opinion, if Jews want to gain liberation, they must convert to Christianity and Hegelian philosophy. Marx refuted Bauer's completely idealistic view, and elaborated on the difference between political liberation and human liberation, pointing out that it is not enough to talk about who is to be liberated and who is to be liberated, but it is also necessary to further explore what kind of liberation is it: political liberation or human liberation? The "political liberation" that Marx said here refers to the bourgeois revolution; the human liberation refers to the socialist revolution. He said that in some countries, Christians and Jews have equally obtained complete political liberation, but have not obtained human liberation. Therefore, he further discussed how to achieve human liberation.

"Introduction to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right" is of particular significance. Marx first exposed the essence of religion here and discussed the significance of criticizing religion; then commented on the political and economic situation in Germany at that time, and further exposed the reactionary Prussian state system. He called on philosophers to criticize existing politics and law. Marx pointed out for the first time in this article that the proletariat is the only class that can eliminate capitalism through socialist revolution. He emphasized the great practical significance of revolutionary ideas, saying: "The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace the criticism of weapons, material force can only be destroyed by material force, but theory, once grasped by the masses, also becomes a material force." (translated copy page 460) He called for combining revolutionary theory with the workers' movement, saying: "Philosophy regards the proletariat as its material weapon, and in the same way, the proletariat regards philosophy as its spiritual weapon." (translated copy page 467)

"Review of 'The King of Prussia and Social Reform' by a 'Prussian'" was published in the "Vorwärts!". "Vorwärts!" was founded in January 1844 by German expatriates living in Paris. Marx established contact with the editorial department of the newspaper and subsequently participated in its editorial work, writing some papers and short comments. This article is one of them. The article "The King of Prussia and Social Reform" was written by Ruge for the "Vorwärts!", but he did not use his real name when publishing it, and signed it "A Prussian." The content of Ruge's article is to discuss the policies of the Prussian government. In his commentary, Marx refuted Ruge's arguments, exposed his limited bourgeois democracy and his hostility to the workers' movement and socialism; in addition, Marx, based on the experience of the Silesian workers' uprising, specifically elaborated on his then-formed idea of the revolutionary role of the proletariat, and clearly pointed out that "socialism is impossible to achieve without revolution" (translated copy page 488).

III

From some of the works of Engels included in Volume One, it can be seen that before cooperating with Marx, Engels also "reached the same result" as Marx "by another path" (Marx's words, see "Preface to 'Critique of Political Economy'"), that is, also from idealism to materialism, and from revolutionary democracy to communism.

Engels had long been inclined to revolution, hating the autocratic system and bureaucratic arrogance. In 1838, he was not yet eighteen years old and had not graduated from middle school. Forced by his father, he went to work for a trading company in Bremen. However, commercial activities did not limit the promising young Engels. He studied hard in his spare time, engaged in writing, and often published some poems or short articles in local newspapers. From 1839, he served as the Bremen correspondent for the "Deutsche Telegraphen-Zeitung". This magazine was published in Hamburg and was the organ of the radical literary group "Young Germany". It was one of the famous socio-political and literary and artistic publications in Germany at that time. From 1839 to the spring of 1841, Engels published some political commentaries, philosophical and literary criticism articles or poems in this magazine, a total of more than twenty articles. In these works, Engels criticized the autocratic regime and feudal land ownership, and advocated the establishment of a democratic and unified Germany.

"Letters from the Wupper Valley" is a particularly important one. From this article, it can be seen that Engels was a fervent revolutionary democrat at that time, and he paid attention to the living conditions of the working class earlier than Marx. Here he described the social conditions of Barmen and Elberfeld and the miserable lives of workers and craftsmen, and exposed the hypocrisy of factory owners and their use of religion to deceive workers. Engels's correspondence, which was not signed with his real name, aroused the anger of the exploiting classes after it was published, and the issue of "Deutsche Telegraphen-Zeitung" containing this correspondence was immediately sold out. People guessed wildly, thinking that the correspondence was written by someone, but never thought of Engels.

In the autumn of 1841, Engels went to Berlin to serve in the military. After arriving here, he enthusiastically devoted himself to the philosophical battles waged by the Hegelian Leftists, and published some articles in the journal "Deutsche Jahrbücher für Wissenschaft und Kunst" run by this faction. The article "Review of Alexander Jung's 'Lectures on Modern German Literature'" is one of them. Here he supported the ideological nature of literature, criticized the intermediate position of representatives of the "Young Germany" faction, criticized their lack of political activism and their lack of definite views in philosophical debates, and criticized the lack of ideological content in their literary works. This article shows that Engels had completely broken away from the "Young Germany" faction at this time.

The article "King Frederick William IV of Prussia" was originally written by Engels for the magazine "Deutsche Blätter aus der Schweiz," which the Hegelian Leftists planned to found in Switzerland, but this magazine was not established, and the articles written for it were later published in the form of a collection, entitled "Einundzwanzig Bogen aus der Schweiz". In this article, Engels criticized the Prussian state system and the idea of the "Christian German State" advocated by King William IV. Here Engels is still a revolutionary democrat.

In September 1842, after Engels's military service expired, he was forced by his father to work in a textile factory jointly run by his father and others in Manchester, England. In November of this year, Engels arrived in England, a typical capitalist country. At this time, due to the development of large-scale industry, the disparity in the living conditions of the two emerging classes in England—the bourgeoisie and the proletariat—and the intensification of their class contradictions were more obvious than in any other country. Engels did not sit in the factory office all day long, but often went to the slums where workers lived to personally investigate the poor lives of workers; at the same time, he also studied all the books and official documents related to the conditions of the British working class. In addition, he also interacted with left-wing leaders of the Chartist movement and participated in some meetings and congresses of the Chartists. The study of British social and economic conditions and class struggles had a great influence on the formation of Engels's political views. This study finally made him a communist. He concluded from this study that the social revolution in England was inevitable, and that the only bearer of this social revolution was the proletariat. Lenin said: "Engels became a socialist only after he went to England." (See Lenin's "On Marx, Engels, and Marxism," Chinese translation, page 50)

Engels wrote many papers during his stay in England. "English View of Internal Crisis," "Internal Crisis," "The Position of Various Political Parties," "Condition of the Working Class in England," "Corn Laws" and other articles were published in the "Rheinische Zeitung" edited by Marx in the form of "Letters from England"; the article "Letters from London" was published in "Schweizerischer Republikaner" after the "Rheinische Zeitung" was sealed. In these articles, Engels commented on British economic issues and social structure issues, and commented on the economic struggles and political struggles that were taking place in Britain at that time, exposing the class nature of the various political parties in Britain. These articles show that Engels had turned to socialism.

When Engels lived in England, he also interacted with followers of the British socialist Owen, and wrote articles for their publication "The New Moral World. Rational Society Report" from 1843 to 1844. Engels at that time seemed to be the contact person between the socialist movements in England and continental Europe. On the one hand, he introduced the British workers' movement and socialism to German readers in publications such as "Rheinische Zeitung" and "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher"; on the other hand, he published articles in "The New Moral World" to introduce the socialist movement in continental Europe to the British masses. "The Progress of Social Reform on the Continent" and "The Movement on the Continent" are two articles that were published in "The New Moral World". In these two articles, Engels commented on the socialist movements in France, Germany, and Switzerland, and briefly discussed the views of utopian socialists Saint-Simon, Fourier, and others, and the philosophy of German idealists Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. He pointed out the shortcomings of these theories, and also pointed out the beneficial things in each theory.

"Outline of a Critique of Political Economy" and "The Condition of England. 'Past and Present' by Thomas Carlyle" were published in the "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher". These two articles are of particular importance in the formation of Engels's political views. They show that Engels had finally turned to materialism and communism.

Although "Outline of a Critique of Political Economy" is not yet a mature Marxist work, it contains the buds of genius ideas. Here, Engels explored commerce, value, price, land rent, capital, labor, competition, monopoly, and so on. He criticized bourgeois political economy and capitalism from the proletarian standpoint; he particularly sharply criticized Malthus's reactionary population theory, calling it "a base and vulgar theory" and "a malicious slander against nature and mankind" (translated copy page 618). He "examined the main phenomena of the modern economic system from the socialist point of view, regarding them as the inevitable result of the domination of private property." (Lenin: "On Marx, Engels, and Marxism," Chinese translation, page 50)

Marx highly praised this article, saying that it was "a genius paper on the criticism of economic categories" (see "Preface to the Critique of Political Economy"). After this article was published, Marx made a summary; he also repeatedly quoted this article when writing "Capital," which also shows Marx's attention to this article.

The article "Review of Thomas Carlyle's 'Past and Present'" criticizes Carlyle's religious views and his attempt to create a new religion—“Labor Religion”—from the standpoint of materialism and atheism, and criticizes the view of "hero worship" he promoted.

"The Condition of England, Eighteenth Century" and "The Condition of England, The English Constitution" were published in the "Vorwärts!" in Paris. The former is an analysis of the British industrial revolution and the social and political changes caused by it. Engels pointed out here: "This revolutionization of British industry is the basis of various relations in modern England, and the driving force of the entire social development." (translated copy page 674) "The Condition of England, The English Constitution" is an analysis of British electoral law, exposing the various shady scenes of British parliamentary elections, such as voters in agricultural areas having to vote according to the will of the landlords, and bribery of voters in various places during elections. Here Engels exposed the class nature of the English constitution and the limitations of bourgeois "freedom," pointing out that true democracy will only arise after the proletariat defeats the bourgeoisie and private ownership.

    介绍“马克思恩格斯全集”第一卷
    张仲实
    一
    “马克思恩格斯全集”第一卷，已根据俄文第二版译成中文出版。
    马恩全集共分三十卷。编入第一卷的是马、恩两人早期的一些最重要的著作，分为两部分：第一部分是马克思在1842——1844年所写的作品，共十六篇，包括：“评普鲁士最近的书报检查令”、第六届莱茵省议会关于出版自由和林木盗窃法的辩论（两篇）、“摩塞尔记者的辩护”、“黑格尔法哲学批判”、“论犹太人问题”、“黑格尔法哲学批判导言”及“评‘普鲁士人’的‘普鲁士国王和社会改革’一文”等；第二部分是恩格斯在1839——1844年所写的作品，共十五篇，包括：“乌培河谷来信”、“评亚历山大·荣克的‘德国现代文学讲义’”、“英国来信”（四篇）、“大陆上社会改革运动的进展”、“政治经济学批判大纲”、“英国状况”（三篇）等。这些作品都是在两人开始共同活动之前写的。
    十九世纪三十和四十两年代是欧洲各国阶级矛盾日益尖锐和革命运动日益成熟的一个时期。在这个时期，好多国家例如法国、英国、比利时、波兰、意大利、西班牙等都先后爆发了革命，其中有的是人民群众进行反对封建主义的斗争；有的是无产阶级已登上历史舞台，开始了反对资本主义剥削制度的斗争。在1848——1849年更爆发了席卷全欧的革命大风暴。
    在三十年代末和四十年代初这几年间，德国正处在资产阶级革命的前夕。欧洲革命运动的中心已经转移至德国。由于受到欧洲其他各国革命运动的影响，这时德国的社会生活日趋活跃，资产阶级和知识分子相继成立了许多文学的和哲学的团体，用讨论哲学问题、批评宗教等方式来进行反对普鲁士君主政体、农奴制度及警察式国家的斗争。
    1839——1844年这个时期正是马克思、恩格斯的青年时代，正是他们的世界观和政治观点形成的年代。这时两人都已经积极地参加了德国的思想斗争和重要的政治事件，锐敏地响应了德国社会发展进程所提出的一些迫切问题。但就政治观点说来，两人起初还都是革命的民主主义者，坚决反对还在德国占统治地位的封建专制制度和反动思想。在哲学方面，由于当时支配德国哲学的是黑格尔学说，两人起初都是黑格尔的信徒，站在黑格尔唯心主义的立场上，不过两人对这一学说的保守的和反动的观点，对这一学说漠视人民群众经济政治利益及敌视革命和民主的观点都不满意，并加以批判。在实际的思想的和政治的斗争中两人才逐步地由唯心主义转向唯物主义，由革命的民主主义转向共产主义。
    第一卷所编入的各篇著作，十分生动而深刻地反映了这一时期德国历史发展的丰富内容。这些著作明确地显示了马克思、恩格斯二人世界观形成的过程，显示了他们怎样由唯心主义转向了唯物主义，由革命的民主主义转向了共产主义。并且这些著作也鲜明地显示出马恩二人从登上政治舞台的时候起就具有了把科学态度和革命精神结合在一起的特点。从这些著作中可以看出，他们为了回答当时社会生活和人民群众的斗争所提出的问题，进行了巨大的科学工作，对前代思想家所造成的一切成果作了批判的研究，从而转到科学的共产主义。
    所以，第一卷编入的各篇作品不仅是研究马克思主义世界观形成的重要史料，而且是全世界劳动人民的理论财富。
    二
    上世纪四十年代初，德国当时的迫切问题之一是出版自由的问题。马克思争取民主自由、反对君主政体和德国封建势力的斗争，就是从揭露普鲁士出版法和书报检查制度开始的。他的头一篇政论文章“评普鲁士最近的书报检查令”一文，就是他这一斗争开始的标志。在这篇文章里面马克思尖锐地抨击了普鲁士反动的书报检查制度，要求废除这种检查制度，实行出版自由。
    1842年1月初，莱茵地区与黑格尔左派接触的资产阶级急进分子在科伦创办了“莱茵报”。这个报纸是德国的全国性刊物。马克思当时住在波恩，他和黑格尔左派的布鲁诺·鲍威尔被聘为该报主要记者，10月间马克思担任该报主笔，移居科伦。该报自马克思主编后，革命的民主趋向表现得愈益明显，变成了急进知识分子的战斗刊物。到1843年3月，该报即被封闭。“莱茵报”是马恩二人的生活和活动中及他们政治观点发展中的一个重要路标。马克思的“关于出版自由……的辩论”以下至“摩塞尔记者的辩护”等八文就是在这个报纸上面发表的。“关于出版自由……辩论”、“第一百七十九号‘科伦日报’社论”、“‘莱比锡总汇报’的查封”等文是坚持出版自由，揭露莱茵省议会的阶级性及其对封建贵族、对封建土地占有制的屈从态度，从而抨击封建特权和全部封建制度。值得指出的是，在“‘莱比锡总汇报’的查封”一文里边，马克思在揭露造谣撒谎的反动报纸时还把它跟人民的报纸对立起来。什么是人民的报纸呢？马克思说：“它生活在人民当中，它真诚地和人民共患难、同甘苦、齐爱憎”（译本一百八十七页）。“关于林木盗窃法的辩论”、“摩塞尔记者的辩护”两文揭露了普鲁士政府和莱茵省议会保护贵族阶级利益的反动措施，捍卫了劳动人民群众的经济利益。
    这些论文的写作对于马克思的世界观和政治观点的形成有很大的意义。据马克思本人后来说，他在“莱茵报”的工作促使他去研究社会物质生活问题，这使他感到自己的经济知识不够，从而促使他去研究经济关系，更进而研究社会主义（详见“政治经济学批判序言”）。从在“莱茵报”上所发表的一些论文中可以看出，马克思已开始从唯心主义向唯物主义、从革命的民主主义向共产主义的转变。
    “黑格尔法哲学批判”一文是马克思在1843年夏季写的，马克思生前未发表过。全文尚未写完，稿子首几页已经遗失，现发表的这一部分是由苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院于1927年首次根据原稿刊出的。这是马克思为了解决使他“激动不安的疑难而着手进行的第一步工作”（见“政治经济学批判序言”）。他在这篇著作里对黑格尔的“法哲学原理”一书第二百六十一——三百一十三节即论述国家问题的一篇作了详尽的批判和分析，号召哲学家去批判政治和法律，批判现存制度。这部著作是马克思从唯心主义转向唯物主义过程中的一个重要阶段。马克思本人后来说过，这番研究工作使他达到这样的结果：“法权关系，也如国家形式一样，不可能从它们本身中得到理解，也不可能从所谓人的精神一般发展过程中得到理解；恰恰相反，它们是根源于物质生活关系，黑格尔曾按照十八世纪英法两国作家先例把这些关系的总和称为‘公民社会’，而对于公民社会的解剖则应当在政治经济学中去寻求。”（见“马克思恩格斯文选”第一卷中译本三百四十页）
    马克思看到在普鲁士封建专制和警察暴政的条件下不可能宣传自己的观点，便于1843年10月底到了巴黎。在巴黎他和亚诺德·卢格合办了一个杂志“德法年鉴”，原定每月出版一次，但该刊仅出版了合刊（1844年二、三两月）一期，即因在德国秘密发行困难和与卢格意见不合而停刊了。摘自“德法年鉴”的书信、“论犹太人问题”、“黑格尔法哲学批判导言”等文，就是在这个刊物上发表的。这个杂志的历史意义就在于马克思在它上面表现出他已最终地转到唯物主义和共产主义，而成为革命的唯物主义哲学和科学的共产主义的先进代表者了。
    摘自“德法年鉴”的书信是马克思给卢格的三封信。在这些信里边，马克思批判了前代的社会主义学说，认为这些学说都是脱离实际的，都是教条主义的，主张把对旧的社会学说的批判和政治、实际斗争结合起来。他说：“在这种情况下，我们就不是以空论家的姿态，手中拿了一套现成的新原理向世界喝道：真理在这里，向它跪拜吧！我们是从世界本身的原理中为世界阐发新原理。”（译本四百一十八页）
    “论犹太人问题”一文是批判布鲁诺·鲍威尔所写的两篇论犹太人问题的文章的。鲍威尔完全从神学的观点出发来论述犹太人的问题，认为犹太人只有放弃自己的宗教才能获得自由，因为基督教国家由于它自身的宗教性质不能解放犹太人，而犹太人由于自身的宗教性质亦不能被解放。基督教徒和犹太人要想获得自由，固然都要放弃宗教，但基督教比犹太教高明，因此，据他的意见，犹太人要想获得解放，就得改信基督教和黑格尔哲学。马克思驳斥了鲍威尔的这种十足唯心主义的见解，详细论述了政治解放和人类解放的区别，指出光谈谁当解放、谁当被解放是不够的，还须进一步探讨是那一种解放：是政治的解放还是人类的解放？马克思在这里所说的“政治解放”是指资产阶级革命；所说的人类解放是指社会主义革命。他说，在某些国家里边，基督教徒和犹太人都同样得到了完全的政治解放，但是并未得到人类的解放。因此，他进而论述了如何达到人类解放的问题。
    “黑格尔法哲学批判导言”一文有特别重大的意义。马克思在这里首先揭露了宗教的本质，论述了批判宗教的意义；接着评述了当时德国的政治经济状况，进而揭露了反动的普鲁士国家制度。他号召哲学家去批判现存的政治和法律。马克思在这篇文章里边首次指出无产阶级是唯一能经过社会主义革命来消灭资本主义的阶级。他强调了革命思想的重大的实际意义，说：“批判的武器当然不能代替武器的批判，物质的力量只能用物质的力量来摧毁，但是理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量。”（译本四百六十页）他号召把革命的理论同工人运动结合起来，说：“哲学把无产阶级当做自己的物质武器，同样地，无产阶级也把哲学当做自己的精神武器。”（译本四百六十七页）
    “评‘普鲁士人’的‘普鲁士国王和社会改革’一文”是在“前进报”上发表的。“前进报”是旅居巴黎的德国侨民于1844年1月创办的。马克思与该报编辑部建立了联系，并随后参加了它的编辑工作，写了一些论文和短评。这篇文章就是其中的一篇。“普鲁士国王和社会改革”一文是卢格为“前进报”写的，但他在发表时未用真姓名，署名“一个普鲁士人”。卢格此文的内容是论述普鲁士政府的政策。马克思在评述中驳斥了卢格的议论，揭穿了他的有限的资产阶级的民主主义及其对工人运动和社会主义的敌视；此外，马克思还根据西里西亚工人起义的经验，具体发挥了他当时已经形成的关于无产阶级的革命作用的思想，并明白指出“社会主义不通过革命是不可能实现的”（译本四百八十八页）。

    从第一卷所编入的恩格斯的一些作品中可以看出，在和马克思合作以前，恩格斯也“由别的路径达到了”马克思“所达到的同样的结果”（马克思语，见“‘政治经济学批判’一书序言”），就是也从唯心主义走向唯物主义，从革命的民主主义走向共产主义。
    恩格斯很早就倾向革命，憎恶专制制度和官僚专横。1838年他不满十八岁，还没有从中学毕业，被父亲所迫，就到不列梅城一家贸易公司经商。但是经商活动并没有限制年轻有为的恩格斯。他在业余努力读书，从事写作，并在当地报纸上常发表一些诗或短文。从1839年起他担任了“德意志电讯”杂志的不来梅通讯员。这个杂志在汉堡出版，是激进的文学团体“青年德意志”的机关刊物。它是当时德国有名的社会政治和文学艺术刊物之一。从1839年起到1841年春，恩格斯在这个杂志上前后发表了一些政论性短评、哲学和文学批评的文章或诗，一共有二十多篇。在这些作品里，恩格斯抨击专制政体和封建土地所有制，主张建立一个民主的统一的德国。
    “乌培河谷来信”一文就是其中特别重要的一篇。从这篇文章中可以看出，恩格斯当时是个热烈的革命的民主主义者，并且他注意工人阶级的生活状况比马克思还早。他在这里描述了巴门和爱北斐特两地的社会状况及工人、手工业者的悲惨生活，并揭穿了厂主的伪善行为和利用宗教欺骗工人的情形。恩格斯的这篇通讯，未署真姓名，在发表以后，引起了剥削阶级的愤怒，登载这篇通讯的一期“德意志电讯”立即销售一空。人们乱加猜测，以为这篇通讯是某人写的，但从未想到恩格斯。
    1841年秋季，恩格斯为了服兵役，到了柏林。他到这里后就热情地投入了左派黑格尔分子所进行的哲学上的战斗，并在这派所办的刊物“德国科学和艺术年鉴”上发表了一些文章。“评亚历山大·荣克的‘德国现代文学讲义’”一文即其中的一篇。他在这里拥护文学的思想性，批评“青年德意志”派代表人物的中间立场，批评他们缺乏政治积极性和在哲学争论中没有一定的观点，批评他们的文学作品缺乏思想性。此文表明，恩格斯这时已完全脱离了“青年德意志”派。
    “普鲁士国王弗里德里希—威廉四世”一文是恩格斯原为黑格尔左派计划在瑞士创办的杂志“来自瑞士的德意志通报”写的稿子，但这个杂志没有办成，为它所约写的文章后来用文集形式出版，题为“来自瑞士的二十一页”。恩格斯在这篇文章里抨击了普鲁士的国家制度和国王威廉四世所鼓吹的“基督教德意志国家”的思想。在这里恩格斯还表现是一个革命的民主主义者。
    1842年9月，恩格斯兵役期满后，又为父亲所迫，到他父亲在英国曼澈斯特和人合办的一所纺织工厂里去工作。在这一年11月里，恩格斯到了英国这个典型的资本主义国家。这个时候，由于大工业的发展，英国两个新兴阶级——资产阶级和无产阶级的生活状况的悬殊及其阶级矛盾的尖锐化，要比其他任何国家都来得显明。恩格斯在这里并不是成日坐在工厂的办公室里，他常到工人居住的污衢陋巷里去亲自考察工人贫困的生活；同时，还研究有关英国工人阶级状况的一切书籍和官方文件。此外，他还和宪章运动左派领袖来往，并参加宪章派的一些会议和大会。对英国社会经济状况和阶级斗争的研究，对恩格斯政治观点的形成有很大的影响。这种研究使他终于成了共产主义者。他从这种研究中得出结论，认为英国的社会革命是不可避免的，而这种社会革命的担负者只有无产阶级。列宁说：“恩格斯到英国后才成为一个社会主义者。”（见列宁著：“论马克思恩格斯及马克思主义”中文译本五十页）
    恩格斯在旅居英国期间写了许多论文。“英国对国内危机的看法”、“国内危机”、“各个政党的立场”、“英国工人阶级状况”、“谷物法”等文，是以“英国来信”形式发表在马克思所主编的“莱茵报”上的；“伦敦来信”一文是“莱茵报”被封以后发表在“瑞士共和主义者”上面的。在这些文章里边，恩格斯评述了英国的经济问题和社会结构问题，并评述了英国当时正在开展的经济斗争和政治斗争，揭穿了英国各政党的阶级性。这些文章显示出恩格斯已转向社会主义。
    恩格斯住在英国时，还跟英国社会主义者欧文的信徒来往，在1843——1844年间还给他们的刊物“新道德世界。合理社会报”撰稿。恩格斯当时好像是英国和欧洲大陆上社会主义运动之间的联系人。一方面，他在“莱茵报”、“德法年鉴”等刊物上向德国读者介绍英国的工人运动和社会主义；另一方面，又在“新道德世界”上发表文章，向英国人民群众介绍欧洲大陆上的社会主义运动。“大陆上社会改革运动的进展”和“大陆上的运动”两文，就是发表在“新道德世界”上面的。恩格斯在这两篇文章里面评述了法国、德国、瑞士的社会主义运动，并扼要地论述了空想的社会主义者圣西门、傅立叶等人的观点及德国唯心主义者康德、费希特、谢林、黑格尔等人的哲学。他指出了这些学说的缺点，同时也指出了每一学说中的有益的东西。
      “政治经济学批判大纲”和“英国状况　评托马斯·卡莱尔的‘过去和现在’”两文是在“德法年鉴”上面发表的。这两篇文章在恩格斯的政治观点的形成上有特别重要的意义。它们表明恩格斯已最终地转向唯物主义和共产主义。
    “政治经济学批判大纲”虽还不是成熟的马克思主义作品，但包含了天才思想的萌芽。恩格斯在这里对于商业、价值、价格、地租、资本、劳动、竞争、垄断等都作了探讨。他从无产阶级的立场批判了资产阶级的政治经济学和资本主义；特别尖锐地抨击了马尔萨斯的反动的人口论，说它是“卑鄙下流的学说”，是“对自然和人类的恶毒的诬蔑”（译本六百一十八页）。他“从社会主义观点上考察了现代经济制度底主要现象，视之为私有财产制统治底必然结果”。（列宁：“论马克思恩格斯及马克思主义”中译本五十页）
    马克思对此文评价很高，说它是“经济学范畴批评的天才论文”（见“政治经济学批判一书序言”）。在这篇文章发表以后，马克思即作了摘要；后来在写“资本论”时也一再引证了此文，从此亦可看出马克思对此文的重视。
    “评托马斯·卡莱尔的‘过去和现在’”一文是从唯物主义和无神论的立场来批判卡莱尔的宗教观点和他想创立一种新的宗教——“劳动教”的企图，并批判他所宣传的“英雄崇拜”的观点。
    “英国状况　十八世纪”和“英国状况　英国宪法”两文发表在巴黎的“前进报”上面。前一篇是分析英国的工业革命及由此而引起的社会的和政治的变化。恩格斯在这里指出：“英国工业的这一番革命化是现代英国各种关系的基础，是整个社会发展的动力。”（译本六百七十四页）“英国状况、英国宪法”一文是分析英国的选举法，揭露英国国会选举的种种黑幕，如农业区选民要依照地主的意志去投票、选举时各地向选民行贿等。在这里恩格斯揭穿了英国宪法的阶级性和资产阶级“自由”的局限性，指出真正的民主只有在无产阶级战胜资产阶级和私有制以后才会产生。
