    Daur Farmers of Nawen Gacha:
    Every Household Becomes a Surplus Grain Household
    (Our Dispatch) The Daur farmers of Nawen Gacha (gacha - meaning village) in Molidawa Banner, Inner Mongolia, at the foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains, have transformed from grain-deficient households to surplus grain households in the first year of achieving advanced collectivization.
    This is a mountainous area where the Daur people live in concentrated communities. In previous years, the grain produced was not enough to be self-sufficient and had to be supplied by the state. In the spring of 1956, an advanced cooperative of one hundred households was established here. Due to the adoption of measures to increase production such as expanding cultivated land area, increasing fertilizer application, promoting new cultivation techniques, using new agricultural implements, and planting high-yield crops, the cooperative's production last year increased by 40% compared to the bumper year of 1954, and the entire cooperative sold 260,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. At the same time, the cooperative operated large-scale sideline occupations such as freight transport, hunting, fishing, and firewood gathering; the cooperative members' families engaged in small-scale sideline occupations such as tobacco cultivation, pig raising, and making "wula" (a type of traditional boot), and the income from family sideline occupations alone averaged about 100 yuan per household. Therefore, 100% of the cooperative members increased their actual income. (Siqin Mengho)

    纳文嘎查的达呼尔族农民
    家家成为余粮户
    本报讯　在大兴安岭脚下的内蒙古莫力达瓦旗纳文嘎查（嘎查——即村子）的达呼尔族农民，在实现高级合作化的第一年，已由缺粮户变成了余粮户。
    这里是达呼尔族人民聚居的山区。往年生产出来的粮食不能自给，要由国家供应。1956年春天，这里建立了一百户的高级社。由于采用了扩大耕地面积、增施肥料、推广新的耕作技术、使用新式农具和种植高产作物等项增产措施，这个社去年比丰收的1954年还增产40％，并且全社卖给国家的余粮达二十六万斤。同时社里经营了拉脚、打猎、打鱼、打柴等大型副业；社员家庭经营了种烟、养猪、做靰鞡等小型副业，单家庭副业收入平均每户也约为一百元。因此，100％的社员增加了实际收入。（思勤蒙和）
