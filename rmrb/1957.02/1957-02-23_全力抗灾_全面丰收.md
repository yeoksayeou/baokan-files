Go All Out to Fight Disaster, Achieve Overall Harvest
Li Shunda, Director of Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, Pingshun, Shanxi

Our cooperative was formed on December 24, 1955, by combining two elementary cooperatives (Jinxing Cooperative with 243 households, Liming Cooperative with 30 households) and eight individual farmers into an advanced cooperative. After establishing the advanced cooperative, the enthusiasm of the members soared to unprecedented heights. During the spring plowing and sowing season, inspired by the slogan "Seize this year for the Five-Year Plan, focus on the present for this year's plan, aim for 450 catties per mu, and make good sowing the key," a competition was launched between teams and groups to "complete the spring sowing tasks quickly and well." In this competition, we also actively learned from advanced experiences from other places and, in accordance with local conditions, adopted the four measures for increasing production proposed by the county party committee: intercropping, interplanting, replanting, and planting along field edges. This not only completed the spring plowing and sowing tasks five days ahead of schedule but also prominently realized the "five transformations" in technology to increase production: (1) transforming low yields into high yields, expanding the area of Jinhuanghou corn from 427 mu to 771 mu; (2) transforming single cropping into intercropping, universally intercropping beans and sorghum in 1,430 mu of major autumn crops; (3) transforming inferior varieties into superior varieties, expanding the area of superior varieties from 75% to 90%; (4) making dense planting more rational, with equidistant rows for corn and measuring tape for millet seedlings to achieve rational dense planting; (5) transforming single cropping into double cropping, expanding the replanting area from 35% to 65%.

Thanks to the hard work of all members and the implementation of technological reforms, the crops grew exceptionally well—the corn was thick, dark, and tall, and the millet densely covered most people. The members were all very happy, saying, "We haven't seen such good crops in decades; a ten-year harvest is almost certain!"

The crops grew better day by day, and in another fifty or sixty days, it would be autumn harvest time. However, at this crucial moment, on the afternoon of July 14, 1956, we suffered a hailstorm with hailstones as large as eggs and as small as peaches and apricots. The hailstorm started at 4:30 pm and lasted for over an hour before stopping. Instantly, the crops of the entire cooperative were battered beyond recognition. According to the disaster investigation results of the management committee, 84% of the autumn crops of the entire cooperative were affected. Among them, more than 390 mu of corn were severely damaged, with an estimated yield reduction of about 50%; more than 500 mu of corn were battered and disheveled, with an estimated yield reduction of over 30%; more than 300 mu of millet were beaten down and scattered; most of the leaves of more than 80 mu of potatoes had fallen off; and one mu of sweet potatoes and five mu of cabbage were completely destroyed, exposing bare land. At that time, many members showed pessimism and disappointment. Ma Haixing said, "Half a year of labor is in vain; we'll be drinking the northwest wind after the autumn harvest, waiting to starve!" Individual members lay down and refused to work, relying solely on state relief. Zhang Yangshui said, "Hailstones hit the west gully, but they can't hit the state warehouse; the Communist Party won't let people starve to death, so there's no need to fight the disaster."

Before the corn that had just been injured by the hailstorm could be propped up, a storm on July 24 knocked down more than 800 mu of corn. Just after the wind disaster, the wind and flood disaster came on July 30. Ninety-four mu of beach land and terraced fields were buried in silt, thirteen sheep and two pigs were washed away by the flood, and 129 houses and 33 cave dwellings collapsed. Grain was buried, fuel was washed away, and roads were blocked. Thirty-four households in the cooperative had housing problems, twenty-six households had nothing to eat, sixty-four households had no firewood, and sixty-two households could not even travel on the roads. This situation made the masses very uneasy. According to the disaster investigation results, the three disasters caused a total reduction of more than 300,000 catties of autumn grain, accounting for 45% of the original planned agricultural income; the entire cooperative would be short of 230,000 catties of grain, and more than 50% of the members would have reduced income compared to 1955.

However, many members of our Jinxing Cooperative were not intimidated by the disasters; everyone actively launched a struggle against the natural disasters.

In response to the difficult situation at the time, the party branch and the management committee made promptly and properly settling the lives of the members the top priority in carrying out production for self-relief. They immediately mobilized the members to adjust and repair more than 100 houses, and the cooperative drew more than 200 catties of grain from the public welfare fund, and the township also supplied more than 400 catties of grain. The cooperative also allocated more than 8,200 catties of firewood and organized more than 200 male laborers to repair all the blocked roads. The difficulties were quickly overcome. In addition, leaders of the party and government came to the disaster area to comfort and provide appropriate relief, and the mood of the masses began to stabilize. Everyone said with emotion, "This is all thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us on the road to collectivization. Who could have thought of us so thoughtfully in the old society! Now we must actively fight the disaster and strive not to rely on state supplies."

After the disaster, it was still the hottest time of the year, and some corn had already shown their tassels, while most of the crops were in the growth stage. Some members, seeing the corn that had been battered beyond recognition by the hailstorm, proposed destroying all of it and replanting late autumn crops. Experienced old farmers disagreed with this approach. Zhang Fu said, "You must understand that 'one change means three losses.' Although the corn was severely damaged, it wasn't necessarily beyond repair. In 1929, there was also a hailstorm, and at that time, all the corn had already tasseled, but we didn't dare to destroy it. We propped up the seedlings and added fertilizer, and in the end, we still harvested 200 catties per mu. The land that was destroyed and replanted with barley and oats only yielded 90 catties. As long as we prop up the seedlings now, add hoeing and fertilizer, the harvest will still not be bad." Other old farmers also offered many beneficial suggestions. Some said, "The fallen corn must be propped up quickly, otherwise, it won't even bear half a cob." Others said, "Rotten leaves are not conducive to the growth of disaster-stricken seedlings and should be cut off immediately." Others said, "Some corn that has been broken should be pulled up, and three radish seedlings should be replanted in each hole." The management committee summarized the various rational suggestions put forward by everyone and analyzed the characteristics of our abundant fertilizer, vigorous crops, and uneven disaster, summarizing seven field remediation measures: propping up seedlings, cutting leaves, adding hoeing, adding fertilizer, replanting, changing crops, and eliminating small barren lands. Then, we planned the labor force of the entire cooperative, so that all members could orderly and intensively engage in late-stage processing and production in the fields. More than 200 women, more than 50 old farmers and children took sickles and hoes to cut leaves and prop up seedlings; more than 300 male laborers rushed to hoe three times and topdress fertilizer; more than 200 male laborers cooperated with the forestry team to dig fish-scale pits on the mountain, block water and silt to create forests, and sow late-autumn vegetables on the edges of the pits to increase current income; and another 50 young and strong men rushed to eliminate small barren lands that had been abandoned in the past. Under the slogan of "Find it back, make it up, overcome disasters, and strive for a bumper harvest," more than 200 mu of autumn seedlings that had been blown down by the storm were quickly propped up. The original plan was to apply 15 dan of fertilizer to 380 mu of autumn fields, but this was increased to 20 dan. More than 400 mu of autumn fields were originally planned to be hoeed twice, but they were actually hoeed three times. At the same time, radishes were replanted in more than 500 mu of land where a small number of corn stalks had been broken, barley was replanted in 98 mu of wheat stubble land, and late-autumn vegetables were also planted in the newly dug more than 3,000 fish-scale pits and 25 mu of small barren lands.

Although so many tasks were successfully completed, the members were still worried. They said, "Relying solely on crops still cannot make up for the losses caused by the disaster; we must find other ways." In this situation, the party branch and the management committee again mobilized all members to widely seek out sideline production opportunities and carry out sideline production. Because democracy was fully promoted and there were many people with wisdom, the entire cooperative newly added and expanded 18 kinds of sideline production, which could increase income by a total of 20,000 yuan. In the spirit of making the best use of people's talents and resources, the cooperative rationally planned the labor force and arranged various sideline production activities, loudly putting forward the action slogan of "Agricultural production reduction is supplemented by sideline production, strive to reduce production but not reduce income." More than 180 women in the cooperative participated in sideline production such as raising pigs, raising chickens, raising silkworms, and milling flour. More than 10 members with workshop skills opened oil mills, flour mills, and brick and tile kilns. More than 20 male laborers went out to work, and more than 10 members went out to drive carts. In addition to these newly added sideline occupations, the members who originally ran the flour mill proposed: to grind more than 100 catties more per day and feed more pigs, striving to increase the cooperative's income by 1,100 yuan after the autumn harvest. The members who ran the mill proposed: to add two more millstones, which could increase the cooperative's income by 800 yuan after the autumn harvest. The members who ran the brick and tile kiln proposed: to add two more workers, which could produce an extra kiln of goods after the autumn harvest, striving to increase the cooperative's income by 500 yuan. By fully exerting the role of each member, various sideline production activities were smoothly carried out. In carrying out sideline production, we also implemented the policy of running the cooperative diligently and frugally. For example, oil mills, flour mills, etc., were built using the old things of the cooperative and its members, which also saved the cooperative more than 250 yuan in expenses.

Our disaster relief struggle was finally victorious. The total output value of the cooperative's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production reached 82,821 yuan (including the personal income of the members), exceeding the 1955 total output value (70,979 yuan) by 16.8%. Because of the transformation from reduced income to increased income, more than 93% of the 281 households in the cooperative increased their income compared to 1955. In agriculture, the total cultivated land was 1,632.2 mu, of which grain crops were 1,485.7 mu, with an average grain yield of 400 catties per mu. Although this was a 12% reduction from the original planned yield per mu (450 catties), it was a 77% increase from the estimated yield after the disaster (225 catties), and a 9.2% increase from the average yield per mu (366 catties) of the two elementary cooperatives and eight individual households in 1955. After the disaster, the cooperative estimated a shortage of 230,000 catties of grain; now, in addition to each person being able to eat an average of 380 catties of grain per year, 37,000 catties of surplus grain were sold to the state. In forestry, 55,000 trees were planted, exceeding the original plan by 10%, and 1,000 mu of forest were planted, completing the plan. In terms of water and soil conservation, 280 flood prevention ditches were repaired, exceeding the original plan by 12%; nine water storage ponds were built, exceeding the original plan by 50%. In animal husbandry, a total of 25 head of livestock were bred, and 285 lambs were bred, all completing and overfulfilling the plan. In sideline production, a total of 20,000 yuan was earned. In addition, the plan of raising one pig and seven chickens per household was also realized. The entire cooperative raised a total of 280 pigs, double the number in 1955.

These achievements made the members very happy. Everyone said: Only because the party led us on the road of collectivization did we have the strength to overcome disasters and eat our fill, and only then could we have made such achievements!

    全力抗灾　全面丰收
    山西平顺金星农林牧生产合作社主任　李顺达
    我们这个社是在1955年12月24日，由两个初级社（金星社二百四十三户，黎明社三十户）和八户个体农民在一起组成高级社的。办了高级社以后，社员们的劳动积极性空前高涨。在春耕播种季节，在“五年计划抓今年，今年计划抓当前，每亩要产四百五，作好播种是关键”的口号鼓舞下，队与队、组与组之间开展了一个“把春播任务完成的又快又好”的竞赛运动。在这个竞赛中，我们还积极地学习了外地的先进经验，因地制宜地采取了县委提出的间作、套种、复播、种边岸等四项增产措施，不仅提前五天完成了春耕播种任务，而且在技术上突出地实现了“五变”的增产措施：（1）低产变高产，金皇后玉米由四百二十七亩扩大到七百七十一亩；（2）单作变间作，在一千四百三十亩大秋作物中普遍间作了豆类和高粱；（3）劣种变优种，优种面积由75％扩大到90％；（4）密植变得更合理，玉米等距划行，谷子带尺留苗，作到合理密植；（5）一作变两作，复播面积由35％扩大到65％。
    全体社员辛勤劳动，又进行了技术改革，庄稼长的特别好——玉米又粗又黑又高，谷子齐密密地掩住了多半人。社员们都非常高兴，他们说：“几十年来也没有见过这么好的庄稼，十成年景是十拿九准了！”
    庄稼一天比一天长的好，眼看再有五六十天就要收秋了。可是，就在这个节骨眼上，1956年7月14日下午，却遭受了一场大如鸡蛋小如桃杏的冰雹的打击。这场冰雹从四点半开始，下了一个多钟头才停止。顿时，把全社的庄稼打了个不成样子。经过管理委员会查灾的结果，全社84％的秋庄稼受了灾。其中有三百九十多亩玉米被打的残缺不全，估计减产五成左右；五百多亩玉米被打的披头散发，估计减产三成以上；三百多亩谷子被打的东倒西歪；八十多亩山药蛋的叶子大部分脱落了；一亩红薯、五亩白菜全部打毁，露出了光秃秃的土地。当时，不少社员表现出悲观失望情绪。马海兴就说：“劳动半年一场空，到了秋后喝西北风，等着饿肚吧！”个别社员躺下不干了，单纯依靠国家救济。张洋水说：“雹子打了西沟打不了国家仓库，共产党不会让饿死人，不抗灾也不怕。”
    刚被冰雹打伤的玉米，还没有来得及扶起来，7月24日一场暴风又把八百多亩玉米刮的扑倒在地。风灾刚过，7月30日风涝灾害又来了，九十四亩滩地、梯田被淤埋，十三只羊两口猪被洪水冲走，一百二十九间房屋和三十三孔窑也坍塌，粮食被掩埋，燃料被冲走，道路被堵塞。全社有三十四户居住成了问题，二十六户吃不上，六十四户没柴烧，六十二户人家连路也不能走了。这种情形使群众非常不安。据查灾的结果，三次受灾共计减产秋粮三十多万斤，占原计划农业收入的45％；全社将要缺粮二十三万斤，50％以上的社员要比1955年减少收入。
    但是，我们金星社的许多社员并没有被灾害吓倒，大家都积极地向自然灾害展开了斗争。
    针对当时出现的困难局面，党支部和管理委员会把迅速地妥善地安置社员的生活，作为开展生产自救的首要一环。立即发动社员，调剂和修补了房屋一百多间，社里又从公益金中抽出了二百多斤粮食，乡里也供应了四百多斤粮食，社里还拨出了八千二百多斤柴，同时又组织了二百多个男劳力把堵塞了的道路全部修通。困难很快就克服了。再加上党和政府的领导人来到灾区进行安慰和适当的救济，群众的情绪开始安定下来了。大家都感动地说：“这都是共产党、毛主席领导咱们走了合作化的道路的好处。要是在旧社会，谁能给咱们想的这么周到！现在可得积极抗灾，争取不依靠国家供应。”
    受灾以后，还是大暑节气，一部分玉米已经露出了脑缨，大部分庄稼正是生长阶段。有些社员看到那被冰雹打的不像样子的玉米，就提出要全部毁种，改种晚秋作物。有抗灾经验的老农民不同意这种做法。张福则说：“你们要懂得，‘一改三不收’，玉米受灾虽然严重，但还不是非毁不行。1929年也下过一次冰雹，那时候玉米都全部抽出了脑缨，我们没有舍得毁，就一边扶苗一边加肥，结果秋后每亩还收了二百斤；毁种成大麦、莜麦的地才只不过收了九十斤。只要我们现在把苗扶起，加锄加肥，收成还是不会坏的。”别的老农也提出许多有益的建议。有的说：“倒了的玉米要赶快扶起来，不然半个穗子也不结籽。”有的说：“烂叶子对灾苗生长不利，应该立即剪掉。”有的说：“有些已经打折了的玉米要拔掉，一窝补种三苗萝卜。”管理委员会综合了大家提出的各种合理化建议，又分析了我们上肥多、庄稼旺、受灾不一致的特点，就归纳出来了扶苗、剪叶、加锄、加肥、补种、改种、消灭小块荒地等七项田间补救办法。接着我们又规划了全社的劳动力，使全体社员都有秩序地紧张地投入了田间后期加工生产。全社有二百多个妇女，五十多个老农和儿童，拿上镰刀和锄头剪叶和扶苗；三百多个男劳力突击锄三遍上追肥；二百多个男劳力配合林业队在山上刨鱼鳞坑，挡水淤泥造林，在坑边上播种晚秋蔬菜，增加当年收入；另有五十个青壮年突击消灭过去弃耕了的小块荒地。在“找回来，补起来，战胜灾害，争取丰收”的口号鼓舞下，很快就把暴风刮倒的二百多亩秋苗全部扶起来了。三百八十亩秋田原计划追肥十五担，这时追加到二十担。四百多亩秋田原计划锄两遍，实际上普锄到三遍。同时，又在五百多亩有少数玉米被打折的地里补种上了萝卜，在九十八亩麦茬地复种了大麦，在新刨的三千多个鱼鳞坑和二十五亩小块荒地上也种了晚秋蔬菜。
    虽然顺利地完成了这么多任务，但是社员们还是很担心。他们说：“光靠庄稼还是弥补不了受灾的损失，还得另想办法。”在这种情况下，党支部和管理委员会又发动全体社员广泛地寻找副业生产门路，开展副业生产。由于充分发扬了民主，人多智广，全社共新添和扩大了十八种副业生产，一共可以增加收入两万元。社里本着人尽其才、物尽其用的精神，合理地规划了劳动力，安排了多种副业生产，响亮地提出了“农业减产副业补，争取减产不减收”的行动口号。全社有一百八十多个妇女参加了养猪、养鸡、养蚕、磨面等副业生产，十多个有作坊技术的社员开办了油坊、粉坊、砖瓦窑，二十多个男劳力出外做工，十多个社员出外赶车。除了新添的这些副业以外，原来经营粉坊的社员们提出：每天要加磨一百多斤，再多喂些猪，争取秋后给社里增加一千一百元的收入。经营磨坊的社员们提出：要再加两盘磨，秋后可以给社里增加八百元的收入。经营砖瓦窑的社员们提出：再增加两个工人，秋后可以多出一窑货，争取给社里增加五百元的收入。充分发挥了每个社员的作用，各项副业生产就顺利地开展起来了。在开展副业生产中，我们还执行了勤俭办社的方针。如油坊、粉坊等，就是利用社里和社员们旧有的东西搞起来的，这也给社里节省了二百五十多元的开支。
    我们的抗灾斗争终于胜利了。全社农、林、牧、副业全部生产总值达到八万二千八百二十一元（包括社员个人收入），超过了1955年生产总值（七万零九百七十九元）的16.8％。由于减收变增收，全社二百八十一户中，有93％以上的社员比1955年增加了收入。在农业方面，总耕地一千六百三十二亩二分，其中粮食作物一千四百八十五亩七分，每亩平均产粮四百斤，虽比原计划亩产量（四百五十斤）减产12％，但比受灾以后估计的产量（二百二十五斤）提高了77％，比1955年两个初级社和八个单干户的每亩平均产量（三百六十六斤）提高了9.2％。灾后，全社估计缺粮二十三万斤；现在除每人平均一年可以吃到三百八十斤粮食以外，还卖给国家余粮三万七千斤。在林业方面，植树五万五千株，超过原计划10％，造林一千亩，完成了计划。在水土保持方面，修防洪沟二百八十条，超过原计划12％；打蓄水池九个，超过原计划50％。在畜牧业方面，共繁殖牲畜二十五头，繁殖小羊二百八十五只，都完成和超额完成了计划。在副业方面，共收入二万元。另外，还实现了家家养猪一口、养鸡七只的计划。全社共养猪二百八十口，比1955年增加了一倍。
    以上这些成就使社员们非常高兴。人人都说：只因为党领导我们走了合作化的道路，我们才有力量战胜灾害吃饱饭，才能做出来这样的成绩！
