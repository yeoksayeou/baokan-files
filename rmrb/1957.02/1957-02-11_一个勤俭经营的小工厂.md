The Local State-Owned Hefei Vermicelli Factory was established at the end of 1954 with an investment of three thousand yuan. At that time, they only had three donkeys, two stone mills, and ten sheds as factory buildings, along with a few simple tools for making vermicelli. However, because they conscientiously implemented the policy of running the enterprise diligently and thriftily, the factory's total capital (including fixed assets) has now reached more than 43,000 yuan, and the output of vermicelli has also been continuously increasing. Last year's actual output increased fourfold compared to 1955, greatly guaranteeing the growing needs of the people of Hefei for vermicelli. The factory's workers pay close attention to improving the quality of the vermicelli and the flour yield. In the beginning, because they couldn't master the fermentation technology of soy milk, the starch, protein, and other impurities in the soy milk couldn't be separated, resulting in black and sour vermicelli that would fall apart when boiled. At the same time, because the fermentation was not good, some of the starch was lost along with the impurities, and the flour yield was very low.

In order to solve this problem, the workers systematically studied the production experience of Longkou vermicelli in Shandong, researched and improved many techniques, and finally mastered the fermentation rules of soy milk, solving the problems of poor vermicelli quality and low flour yield. Now, the vermicelli they produce has completely caught up with the quality of the nationally famous Longkou vermicelli. The flour yield per hundred catties of mung beans has also reached thirty-four catties, one to two catties more than other vermicelli factories in Anhui.

The biggest byproduct of making vermicelli is the starch slurry water. Starch slurry water contains a lot of protein, which in the past was generally discarded as waste. After repeated research and experiments, the factory's workers used the protein in the starch slurry water to make very good MSG and soy sauce essence. Each hundred catties of mung beans used to make vermicelli leaves behind starch slurry water that can be used to make two catties and twelve taels of MSG and thirty catties of soy sauce essence; the quality of the MSG and soy sauce essence is no worse than that made from wheat.

Because the quality and flour yield of the vermicelli have improved, and the starch slurry water has been fully utilized, the production cost of vermicelli in this factory has been continuously reduced. Last year, the production cost per catty of vermicelli was more than three cents lower than in 1955. Because of the reduced costs and increased production, the factory earned a total profit of more than 21,000 yuan last year, of which more than 6,000 yuan was turned over to the state.

Although this factory's production performance is very good, its equipment is still very simple. In the second half of 1955, the original ten dilapidated sheds were no longer usable, so they rebuilt ten factory buildings and added two electric mills. The construction cost of these ten factory buildings was only 3,400 yuan in total. The wood for the factory doors and windows was all purchased used doors, windows and used materials, and the walls were made of mud and bamboo strips.

Now, the factory's workers have developed a hardworking and thrifty style. The room they use as a dining hall is renovated from the original old shed. Last year, they also used bamboo and thatch to build two rooms as a club, where workers play table tennis and read newspapers and books after work.

Factory director Jin Yuming said that they are also preparing to further tap the potential of existing equipment and strive to produce 48,000 catties more vermicelli this year than last year to meet market demand.

    一个勤俭经营的小工厂
    新华社记者　汤天真
    地方国营合肥粉丝厂是1954年底以三千元的投资开办起来的。当时，他们只有三头驴、两盘石磨和十间作为厂房用的工棚，还有几件简单的做粉用的工具。可是由于他们认真贯彻勤俭办企业的方针，现在厂里的全部资金（包括固定财产在内）已经达到四万三千多元，而且粉丝的产量也不断的增加。去年的实际产量比1955年增加了四倍，大大保证了合肥市人民对粉丝的日益增长的需要。这个厂的职工很注意提高粉丝的质量和出粉率。开始时，他们由于掌握不好豆浆的发酵技术，豆浆里的淀粉、蛋白和其他杂质分不开，结果做出来的粉丝色黑味酸，放在锅里一煮就烂。同时，因为发酵不好，部分淀粉随着杂质流掉，出粉率也很低。
      为了解决这个问题，职工们系统地学习了山东龙口粉丝的生产经验，研究改进了许多技术，终于掌握了豆浆的发酵规律，解决了粉丝质量不高和出粉率低的问题。现在，他们做出的粉丝完全赶上了全国著名的龙口粉丝的质量。每百斤绿豆的出粉率也达到了三十四斤，比安徽其他的粉丝厂能多出一斤到两斤粉丝。
    做粉丝最大的副产品是粉浆水。粉浆水里含有大量的蛋白质，过去一般都是作为废料抛掉。这个厂的职工经过反复的研究和试验，利用粉浆水里的蛋白质，做出了很好的味精和酱油精。每做一百斤绿豆的粉丝剩下的粉浆水，就可以做出二斤十二两味精和三十斤酱油精；味精和酱油精的质量，一点也不比用小麦做成的差。
    这个工厂由于粉丝质量和出粉率的提高，粉浆水被充分利用，粉丝的生产成本也在不断的降低，去年每斤粉丝的生产成本，又比1955年降低了三分多。因为降低了成本和增加了产量，这个厂去年共获得了两万一千多元的利润，其中上缴给国家六千多元。
    这个工厂的生产成绩虽然很好，可是直到现在设备依然很简陋。在1955年下半年，原来的十间破烂的工棚实在不能用了，他们才重建了十间厂房，添设了两盘电磨。这十间厂房的建筑费，总共才用了三千四百元。厂房用的门窗等木料，全是买来的旧门窗和旧料，墙壁也是用泥笆做成的。
    现在，这个厂的职工已经养成勤俭朴素的作风。他们作为饭厅用的屋子，是原来的旧工棚修补成的。去年，他们还利用竹笆和茅草盖了两间房子作为俱乐部，职工们下班后就在这里打乒乓球，阅读书报。
    厂长靳玉明说，他们还准备进一步发挥现有设备的潜力，争取今年再比去年多生产四万八千斤粉丝，以满足市场的需要。
