Xinhua News Agency, February 27th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations Special Political Committee continued its discussion on February 26th regarding U.S. interference in the internal affairs of socialist countries and its subversive activities against these countries.

    Albanian representative Nasse pointed out the various methods the U.S. uses to carry out subversive activities against Albania. He said that the U.S., through radio stations and leaflets, called on the Albanian people and the people of other socialist countries to engage in sabotage and armed rebellion. All of this undoubtedly shows that the U.S. authorities are deliberately undermining the sovereignty of Albania and other socialist countries.

    Ukrainian Republic representative Kizya pointed out that subversive activities have become a fundamental U.S. foreign policy. This activity is one of the main causes of international tension. Kizya said that the confessions of spies and saboteurs arrested in Ukraine prove that U.S. intelligence agencies control all émigré organizations and direct them to carry out subversive activities against socialist countries.

    Romanian representative Roza pointed out that U.S. interference in the internal affairs of other countries violates the United Nations Charter. After pointing out specific examples of U.S. interference in Romania's internal affairs, he expressed support for the Soviet proposal.

    Belarusian representative Kiselev's speech listed the figures of funds used by the U.S. for subversive activities and examples of U.S. intelligence agencies carrying out subversive activities against Belarus.

    The representatives of the aforementioned countries all demanded that the United Nations take measures to stop U.S. subversive activities and interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

    Representatives of countries participating in military blocs organized by the United States spoke to defend U.S. subversive and aggressive activities. Australian representative Spender was particularly energetic. He slandered the Soviet proposal as stemming from "propaganda considerations."

    British representative Dixon, disregarding the specific facts of U.S. interference in the internal affairs of other countries cited by many representatives in their speeches, asked the committee to reject the Soviet delegation's proposal. Irish representative Boland also defended U.S. subversive activities.

    Representatives from Thailand, Argentina, and Bolivia also spoke against the Soviet proposal.

    Soviet delegation leader Kuznetsov spoke to refute the U.S. representative's claim that current U.S. policy is a "friendly" policy towards the people of socialist countries.

    Kuznetsov said that all irrefutable materials, including bills on funding subversive activities, speeches by members of both houses of the U.S. Congress, and the specific facts of the criminal activities of spies, saboteurs, and terrorists from U.S. intelligence agencies, irrefutably prove that the U.S. government has elevated subversive and destructive activities against people's democracies to the status of national policy.

    Kuznetsov also cited a plan openly calling for subversive activities against socialist countries submitted to the Senate by Senator Wiley on November 30, 1950. He pointed out that since then, no one has said that the U.S. Senate has rejected or condemned this plan. On the contrary, many members of Congress and government officials have called for intensifying subversive activities against socialist countries.

    After condemning the U.S. "liberation" policy towards the Eastern European people's democracies, Kuznetsov added that the U.S. representative insisted that the speeches of certain U.S. government officials proved the peaceful nature of U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. He said that in reality, these speeches were about the overthrow of popularly elected governments and the abolition of the people's democratic system, the only difference being that these claims were put forward in a more concealed way.

    He said that the U.S. government has not only recently intensified hostile subversive activities against the people's democracies, but also tried to prevent the development of relations between the United States and socialist countries. Recently, the U.S. authorities have even interrupted the small amount of contact that had begun to occur in 1955 and the first half of 1956, and have adopted a policy of isolating the American people from the people of socialist countries as much as possible.

    Kuznetsov continued by saying that as for the Soviet Union, it has always advocated developing cultural and economic relations and contacts with all countries, including the United States.

    Kuznetsov finally pointed out that the Soviet government's foreign policy is a firm policy of peaceful coexistence. He said that the Soviet delegation believes that international situation can only be improved and international trust can only be strengthened if the U.S. government does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and stops U.S. subversive activities against the people's democracies.

    联大特别政委会继续讨论美国干涉社会主义国家内政问题
    苏阿等国代表列举事实指责美国颠覆活动
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国特别政治委员会26日继续讨论美国干涉社会主义国家的内政和对这些国家进行破坏活动的问题。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表纳塞发言指出了美国对阿尔巴尼亚进行破坏活动的种种方式。他说，美国通过电台和传单，号召阿尔巴尼亚人民以及其他社会主义国家的人民进行怠工，举行武装暴动。这一切无疑说明，美国当局处心积虑破坏阿尔巴尼亚和其他社会主义国家的主权。
    乌克兰共和国代表基齐亚指出，颠覆活动成了美国基本的外交政策。这种活动是国际局势紧张的主要原因之一。基齐亚说，在乌克兰境内被捕的间谍和破坏分子的供词证明，美国间谍机关掌握所有流亡者的组织，指挥它们对社会主义国家进行破坏活动。
    罗马尼亚代表若扎指出美国干涉他国内政是违反联合国宪章的。他在指出了美国干涉罗马尼亚内政的具体事例后，表示支持苏联的提案。
    白俄罗斯代表基谢廖夫的发言列举了美国用于颠覆活动的经费的数字和美国间谍机关对白俄罗斯进行颠覆活动的实例。
    上述国家的代表都要求联合国采取措施制止美国的颠覆活动和干涉他国内政的行为。
    参加美国组织的军事集团的国家的代表发言替美国的颠覆活动和侵略活动辩护。澳大利亚代表斯宾德特别卖力。他污蔑苏联的提案是出自“宣传考虑”。
    英国代表狄克逊不顾许多代表在发言时引证的美国干涉别国内政的具体事实，要求委员会拒绝苏联代表团的提案。爱尔兰代表波兰德也为美国的颠覆活动辩护。
    泰国、阿根廷和玻利维亚的代表也发言反对苏联提案。
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫发言驳斥了美国代表把美国当前的政策说成是对社会主义国家人民“友好”的政策的说法。
    库兹涅佐夫说，一切无可辩驳的材料，其中包括关于资助颠覆活动的法案，美国国会两院议员的讲话，美国间谍机关的间谍、破坏分子和恐怖分子的罪恶活动的具体事实，都无可反驳地证明了美国政府把对人民民主国家进行颠覆破坏活动提升到国家政策的地位。
    库兹涅佐夫还引证了参议员维利在1950年11月30日向参议院提出的一个公然要求对社会主义国家进行颠覆活动的计划。他指出，从那时以来，没有人说过美国参议院否决了或者是谴责了这个计划。反而有许多议员和政府人士叫喊加紧对社会主义国家进行颠覆活动。
    库兹涅佐夫在谴责了美国对东欧人民民主国家的“解放”政策以后还说，美国代表硬说某些美国政府人士的讲话证明了美国对苏联和人民民主国家政策的和平性质。他说，实际上，这些讲话是关于推翻人民选出的政府和取消人民民主制度的主张，不同的只是，这些主张提得比较隐瞒而已。
    他说，美国政府不仅最近对人民民主国家加强了敌意的颠覆活动，而且设法不让美国和社会主义国家之间发展关系。最近，美国当局甚至中断了在1955年和1956年上半年才开始发生的一点接触，并且采取了尽可能地使美国人民和社会主义国家的人民隔离的方针。
    库兹涅佐夫接着说，至于苏联，它始终主张同一切国家，包括美国在内发展文化以及经济方面的关系和接触。
    库兹涅佐夫最后指出，苏联政府的外交政策是坚定的和平共处政策。他说，苏联代表团认为，只有美国政府不去干涉其他国家的内政，停止美国对人民民主国家的颠覆活动，才能改善国际局势和加强国际信任。
