    The "Eisenhower Doctrine"—what exactly is it? It can be seen most clearly in the U.S. attitude toward Israel's refusal to withdraw its troops from Egypt. Whether it's Dulles' two-point plan of February 11 concerning Israeli withdrawal, or Eisenhower's speech of February 20 on the Middle East situation, both demonstrate that the U.S. Middle East policy is not, as the "Eisenhower Doctrine" claims, for "peace" in the Middle East, but rather openly protects the aggressor, attempting to intensify the tense situation in the Middle East region.

    Israel is the aggressor. Its withdrawal of invading troops from the Gaza Strip and the Red Sea coast in Egyptian territory should be unconditional. The UN's resolutions have also been for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from Egypt. Israel's refusal to implement the UN resolutions should have been subject to severe UN sanctions long ago. However, the U.S. has adopted a cunning attitude, effectively standing on the side of the Israeli aggressor, thus rendering the UN powerless to stop Israel's aggression. The U.S. strives to avoid the UN taking sanctions against Israel, even repeatedly delaying UN discussions on the issue of Israeli withdrawal; on the other hand, it puts forward a two-point plan to Israel separately, bypassing the UN, namely, after Israel withdraws from Egyptian territory, the U.S. guarantees the long-term presence of UN forces in the Gaza Strip and the free passage of Israeli ships through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal. This U.S. action is an open connivance with the Israeli aggressor, not only violating the interests of peace in the Middle East, but also a blatant contempt for UN resolutions and dignity!

    The so-called two-point plan that the U.S. unilaterally put forward to Israel seriously damages Egypt's dignity and sovereignty. This is tantamount to requiring the invaded Egyptian people to accept the preconditions for the withdrawal of the Israeli aggressors. Therefore, Dulles' announcement of these two points on February 11 immediately met with sharp criticism from Egyptian public opinion and all righteous public opinion in the world. At the same time, encouraged by Dulles' two-point plan, the Israeli aggressors more stubbornly expressed their unwillingness to withdraw their troops. In this case, Eisenhower had to personally come forward and deliver a radio speech on February 20, attempting to mend the U.S. policy and ease the opposition from the Middle East and world public opinion. However, in his speech, although Eisenhower said that "the United Nations has no choice but to exert pressure on Israel to comply with the withdrawal resolution," he still emphasized the repetition of Dulles' two-point plan. Eisenhower also affirmed that "the Gulf of Aqaba constitutes the high seas," and "the United States is prepared to exercise this right itself and will work with other countries to obtain universal recognition of this right." He also stated that if Egypt prevents Israeli ships from using the Suez Canal or the Gulf of Aqaba after Israel withdraws, the United Nations will "deal decisively" with Egypt's actions. Eisenhower's speech is actually a threat to Egypt.

    The U.S. is constantly putting pressure on Egypt by using the issue of Israeli withdrawal, and its intentions are extremely clear. The Egyptian people's tenacious struggle to defend their independence and sovereignty is a serious obstacle to the U.S.'s aggressive plan to promote the so-called "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East. According to the "New York Times" on February 13, the U.S. is currently "trying to break Egypt's monopoly on maritime traffic between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean." The Associated Press also said on the same day: "The U.S. goal is to open up another oil transportation route through Israel" in order to "break through Egypt and Syria's constraints on the European economy." This fully exposes the aggressive ambitions of the U.S.

    Many Asian and African countries have long suggested that the United Nations impose sanctions on Israel. The United Nations is about to meet to discuss sanctions against Israel's refusal to implement the withdrawal resolution. But it should be noted that the reason why Israel dares to resist the implementation of the UN's resolutions is mainly due to the support of the U.S. behind it. Therefore, to ensure the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli aggressors from Egyptian territory, and to ensure the independence and security of Middle Eastern countries, it is necessary to first condemn the U.S.'s connivance and protection of Israeli aggressors, and to stop the U.S.'s aggression against the Middle East.

### 美国对以色列侵略者的纵容

    美国对以色列侵略者的纵容
    “艾森豪威尔主义”究竟是个什么东西，从美国对待以色列拒绝从埃及撤军问题的态度上看得最清楚不过了。无论是杜勒斯2月11日提出的关于以色列撤军的两点计划，或艾森豪威尔2月20日发表的关于中东局势的演说，都说明美国的中东政策绝不是像“艾森豪威尔主义”所标榜的是为了中东的“和平”，而是公然包庇侵略者，力图加剧中东地区的紧张局势。
    以色列是侵略者，它从埃及领土加沙地区和亚喀巴湾沿海撤退侵略军，应该是无条件的。联合国的历次决议，也是要以色列无条件地从埃及撤军。以色列拒不执行联合国的历次决议，本来早就应该受到联合国的严厉制裁了。可是，美国却采取狡猾的态度，实际上站在以色列侵略者一边，因而使联合国对于制止以色列的侵略行动感到无能为力。美国一方面竭力避免联合国对以色列采取制裁措施，甚至一再拖延联合国对以色列撤军问题的讨论；一方面却撇开联合国单独向以色列提出两点计划，即在以色列从埃及领土撤军之后，美国保证联合国部队长期留驻加沙地区和以色列船舶可以自由通过亚喀巴湾和苏伊士运河。美国这样做，是对以色列侵略者的公开纵容，不仅违背中东地区的和平利益，并且是对联合国决议和尊严的公然蔑视！
    美国擅自向以色列提出的所谓两点计划，严重地损害了埃及的尊严和主权。这等于是要被侵略的埃及人民接受以色列侵略者撤军的先决条件。因此，杜勒斯在2月11日宣布这两点计划后，立即遭到了埃及舆论和世界上一切主持正义的舆论的尖锐抨击。同时，以色列侵略者由于受到杜勒斯两点计划的鼓励，更加横蛮地表示不愿撤军。在这种情况下，艾森豪威尔不得不亲自出马在2月20日发表广播演说，企图弥缝美国的政策，缓和中东和世界舆论的反对。可是，艾森豪威尔在他的演说中，虽然表示“联合国除了对以色列行使压力，要它遵从撤军决议之外别无他法”，却还是着重地重复提出了杜勒斯的两点计划。艾森豪威尔并且肯定地认为，“亚喀巴湾构成了公海”，“美国准备本身行使这项权利，并且将和其它国家一起来取得对这一权利的普遍承认”。他还表示，如果埃及在以色列撤军之后阻止以色列船舶使用苏伊士运河或亚喀巴湾，联合国就要对埃及的行动“断然加以处理”。艾森豪威尔的演说，实际上是对埃及进行威胁。
    美国利用以色列撤军问题向埃及不断施加压力，它的用意是极端明显的。埃及人民为了保卫自己的独立和主权进行的顽强斗争，对于美国要在中东地区推行所谓“艾森豪威尔主义”的侵略计划是个严重的障碍。据“纽约时报”2月13日透露，美国目前“正在设法打破埃及对红海、地中海之间海上交通的垄断权”。合众社在同一天也说：“美国的目标是要穿过以色列开辟另外一条运油路线”，以“突破埃及和叙利亚对欧洲经济的束缚”。这就充分地暴露了美国的侵略野心。
    许多亚非国家早就建议联合国对以色列进行制裁。联合国就要开会讨论对以色列抗拒执行撤军决议的制裁措施了。但是应该看到，以色列之所以敢于抗拒执行联合国的历次决议，主要是美国在它背后撑腰的结果。因此，要使以色列侵略军立即无条件地从埃及领土上撤退，要确保中东各国的独立和安全，就必须首先谴责美国对以色列侵略者的纵容和包庇，制止美国对中东的侵略行动。
