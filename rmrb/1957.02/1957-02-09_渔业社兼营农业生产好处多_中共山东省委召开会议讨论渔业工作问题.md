Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th - Fishery production cooperatives combining with agricultural production have many advantages. This is the view reached by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China after recently convening a meeting of responsible cadres from coastal areas and lake regions to discuss the issue.

The discussion concluded that the specialization of fisheries, which had been promoted in coastal areas of Shandong, had reduced the income of some fishery cooperatives and affected the consolidation of the cooperatives. This was a manifestation of subjectivism and blindness in leadership work. In future fishery work, this lesson must be seriously learned. Combining fishery and agriculture can ensure stable and continuous increases in the income of cooperative members, with good and bad harvests in fishery and agriculture mutually adjusting and supporting each other. At the same time, it can enable the unified allocation and rational use of labor, materials, and financial resources in fishery and agriculture, fully exploiting potential, and facilitating the development of fishery and diversified agricultural and sideline production. Especially in the current situation where fishery production tools and technology are relatively backward, the difference between the peak and off-seasons is very large, and production is unstable, this approach is even more practical. Specializing in fishery cooperatives is beneficial when fishermen's homes are far from the sea, fishing gear is sufficient, and year-round operations are possible. However, it is more harmful than beneficial to cooperatives with a certain amount of land and insufficient fishing gear or inability to operate year-round. This is because in the past, the livelihoods of fishermen mostly came from half-fishing and half-farming. After specialization, fishermen only fish and do not farm, inevitably leading to reduced income and difficult living conditions. Therefore, the meeting believes that the organizational form of fishery cooperatives must be determined according to the different characteristics of fishery production in coastal and lake areas, based on the principles of benefiting the development of fishery production, facilitating diversified operations, and ensuring the continuous increase of fishermen's income, and adapted to local conditions and cooperatives.

For fishery cooperatives whose income decreased last year due to the implementation of specialization, the meeting believed that, according to the needs and labor conditions of the fishery cooperatives, consultations should be held with agricultural cooperatives to return most or part of the land, grasslands, orchards, etc., that had been handed over for the fishery cooperatives to manage.

    渔业社兼营农业生产好处多
    中共山东省委召开会议讨论渔业工作问题
    新华社济南6日电　渔业生产合作社兼营农业生产好处多，这是中共山东省委不久前召集沿海地区和湖区有关部门负责干部开会讨论后的看法。
    这次讨论结果认为，曾经在山东沿海地区推行的渔业专业化，使部分渔业社收入减少，影响了社的巩固，这是领导工作中的主观主义和盲目性的表现。在今后的渔业工作中，必须认真记取这个教训。渔业和农业结合，既可以保证社员收入稳定和不断增加，渔农丰歉可以互相调剂和支援，同时可以使渔业和农业的劳力、物力、财力统一调配，合理使用，充分发挥潜力，有利于发展渔业和农副业多种生产。特别是在当前渔业生产工具和生产技术比较落后、渔汛淡季旺季的差别很大、生产不稳定的情况下，这种做法更是切合实际的。专业化的渔业社，在渔民家乡远离海口，渔具充足，能够常年作业的条件下是有好处的；但是对有一定数量土地，渔具不足或不能常年作业的社则是利少害多。因为过去渔民生活来源大都是半渔半农，专业化后渔民只渔不农，势必造成收入减少，生活困难。因此，会议认为，必须根据沿海、沿湖不同的渔业生产特点，根据有利于发展渔业生产、有利于开展多种经营，保证渔民收入不断增加的方针，因地因社制宜地确定渔业社的组织形式。
    对于去年由于实行专业化而收入减少的渔业社，会议认为应该根据渔业社的需要和劳动条件，同农业社协商，把交出的土地、草场、果园等退回大部或一部分，由渔业社经营。
