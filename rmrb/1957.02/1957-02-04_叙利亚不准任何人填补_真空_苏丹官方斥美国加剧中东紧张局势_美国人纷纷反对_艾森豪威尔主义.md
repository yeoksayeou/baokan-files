Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, Dispatch from Damascus: Syrian President Kuwatly warned today that Syria is accustomed to fighting and has been fighting for its independence and will not allow anyone to fill the so-called "vacuum."

In a radio address today, he said that Syria has been filling the "vacuum" for the past eleven years without the help of any country.

In his speech, Kuwatly talked about his recent visits to the Soviet Union and his impressions of India and Pakistan. He said that when we visited the Soviet Union, it was during the time of the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt. "The Soviet Union did not bargain for their aid, and they did not demand concessions for bases. They encouraged our neutral stance."

In his speech, he also condemned the imperialists for using false information to slander Syria.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, TASS, Delhi, 2nd: The Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" reported that Sudanese Deputy Prime Minister Mirghani Hamza, who arrived in Delhi on January 31, said that Eisenhower's Middle East plan has made the situation in the region even more tense.

He pointed out that the competition among colonial countries in the Middle East is a serious threat to the Arab world, and the only way to safeguard the interests of the Arab people is to consolidate their unity and oppose the plans of the colonial countries.

The Sudanese Deputy Prime Minister also said that the Sudanese government's policy is to pursue a policy of neutrality and promote peace, as well as maintain friendly relations with all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 3rd: Sudanese Minister of the Interior and Chairman of the Sudanese People's Democratic Party, Rahman, told reporters from the "Al-Gomhuria" on the 1st that the Arab countries, by virtue of their strategic position, can shatter Eisenhower's dream by establishing a united front and pursuing a policy of active neutrality. He also said, "No force in the world can impose policies on us that we do not agree with or that are not in our interests."

He condemned the U.S., British, and French embassies in Khartoum for attempting to control Sudan's markets and resources. The minister said, "Although we need foreign capital to exploit our wealth, we are very careful not to allow any foreign forces to infiltrate our country."

He said that Sudan opposes the Baghdad Pact, but it welcomes the formation of a tripartite alliance with Egypt and Ethiopia.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, TASS, New York: American newspapers reported that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has been opposed and condemned by many ordinary Americans in the United States.

According to the "New York Times," in a poll conducted by the "Hammond Times," 80% of the 1,000 readers in Hammond City (Indiana) expressed opposition to the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The newspaper also reported that the members of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is currently discussing the "Eisenhower Doctrine," have received many letters expressing opposition to this "doctrine." The newspaper pointed out that, in fact, "criticism of the 'Eisenhower Doctrine' is widespread throughout the country."

For example, a resident of Boston wrote that only those who want war need this "doctrine," and a farmer in Arkansas said in a letter that he did not like "Eisenhower and Dulles's trickery; they are full of lies, they have not told the truth." A resident of Tacoma, Washington, pointed out that the Eisenhower Doctrine "has a strong gasoline smell."

    叙利亚不准任何人填补“真空”
    苏丹官方斥美国加剧中东紧张局势
    美国人纷纷反对“艾森豪威尔主义”
    新华社3日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总统库阿特利今天警告说，叙利亚是习惯于进行斗争的，它一直在为了它的独立而进行斗争，它将不准任何人来填补所谓“真空”。
    他在一篇广播演说中说，叙利亚在过去十一年中，没有任何国家的帮助，一直就在填补“真空”。
    库阿特利在演说中谈到了他最近访问苏联以及印度和巴基斯坦的印象。他说，在苏联，我们访问的时候正好是英、法、以三国对埃及进行侵略的时候。“苏联并没有为了他们的援助而讨价还价，他们并没有要求让予基地。他们鼓励我们的中立立场。”
    他在演说中还谴责帝国主义者用假消息来诬蔑叙利亚。
    新华社3日讯　塔斯社德里2日讯：印度“甘露市场报”报道，1月31日来到德里的苏丹副总理米尔加尼·哈姆扎说，艾森豪威尔的中东计划使这一地区的局势更加紧张了。
    他指出，殖民国家在中东的竞争是对阿拉伯世界的严重威胁，保卫阿拉伯各国人民的利益的唯一道路就是巩固他们之间的团结和反对殖民国家的计划。
    苏丹副总理又说，苏丹政府的政策是奉行中立政策和促进和平，以及同所有国家保持友好关系。
    新华社开罗3日电　苏丹内政部长、苏丹人民民主党主席拉赫曼1日向“共和国报”记者说，阿拉伯国家凭借它们的战略地位，可以粉碎艾森豪威尔的梦想，办法是建立一条统一战线和奉行积极的中立政策。他又说，“世界上任何势力都不能把我们不同意的和不符合我们的利益的政策强加在我们头上。”
    他谴责美国、英国和法国驻喀土穆的大使馆企图控制苏丹的市场和资源。这位部长说，“尽管我们需要外国资本来开采我国的财富，但是，我们却非常当心，不让任何外国势力渗入我们的国家。”
    他说，苏丹反对巴格达条约，但是它欢迎同埃及和埃塞俄比亚结成三国联盟。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国报纸报道，“艾森豪威尔主义”在美国国内遭到了许多普通美国人的反对和谴责。
    据“纽约时报”报道，在“哈蒙德时报”进行民意测验时，哈蒙德城（印第安纳州）一千个读者中80％的人都表示反对“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    这家报纸还报道说，目前正在讨论“艾森豪威尔主义”的美国参议院外交委员会的委员们接到了许多表示反对这个“主义”的来信。这家报纸指出，实际上，“全国各地（都对“艾森豪威尔主义”）纷纷提出批评”。
    例如，波士顿的一个居民写道，只有希望战争的人才需要这个“主义”，阿肯色州一个农民在信中说，他不喜欢“艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的鬼蜮伎俩；他们假话连篇，他们没有说过真话”。华盛顿州塔科马城一个居民指出，艾森豪威尔主义“带有浓厚的汽油味”。
