The Lanzhou Refinery Under Construction

    At the massive construction site of the Lanzhou Refinery, a scene of intense activity prevails, even in temperatures of minus twenty degrees Celsius. On the twelve roads, totaling over twenty kilometers in length, within the entire factory area, trucks carrying materials race back and forth. Dozens of tractors and cranes operate and lift incessantly. The oil tank area has already taken shape, and towering oil refining towers have been erected beside the vast ancient Great Wall. To ensure that the first batch of projects at the Lanzhou Refinery is completed on schedule this year, workers from all over the country are working day and night.

    Right image: The thermal cracking workshop of the fuel oil production system already has several oil refining towers erected. The production equipment here is constructed according to the latest Soviet design standards. When put into production in the future, all operations will be controlled by instruments. Not only will the factory be clean and quiet, but it will also be very safe. This is a corner of the thermal cracking workshop.
    Top image: Some parts of the reactors in the catalytic cracking workshop are made of stainless steel. The picture shows workers performing the fitting work of the reactor.
    Top right image: To ensure the quality of oil tank assembly and welding, workers are using air compressors to test the tanks.
    Bottom image: The underground pipelines in the factory area are approximately 690 kilometers long. They have now begun to be laid. In the future, after the crude oil is refined, it will be sent from the underground pipelines to the oil loading platform, and then trains will transport the oil products along the railway line.

    建设中的兰州炼油厂
    在规模巨大的兰州炼油厂工地上，就是在零下二十度的天气里，也呈现着一片紧张繁忙的景象。在整个厂区十二条长二十多公里的马路上，奔驰着运料的大卡车；数十台拖拉机和起重机不停地在运转和升降。油罐区已出现了雏型，空旷的古长城边已竖立起高耸的炼油塔。为了保证兰州炼油厂今年第一批投入生产的工程按时完工，来自全国各地的工人正在日夜施工。　司马摄（甘肃日报社稿）（附图片）
    上图：成排的高大储油罐满布厂区。
    右图：生产燃料油系统的热烈化车间，已经立起了几个炼油塔。这里的生产装置，都是根据苏联最新的设计标准而建设的，将来投入生产后，全部采用仪表操纵，不但厂内清洁安静，而且十分安全。这是热烈化车间的一角。
    上图：催化裂化车间的反应器，有一部分是采用不锈钢装置的。图为工人们正在作反应器的对装工作。
    右上图：为了保证储油罐组合安装和焊接质量，工人们正利用空气压缩机打风试罐。
    下图：回旋在厂区的地下管道共长约六百九十公里。现在已经开始埋设，将来原油经过炼制后，从地下管道送到装油台，火车又从装油台运出油品，沿着铁路线运出。
