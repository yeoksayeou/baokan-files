Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, February 17th: The coal city of Fushun has begun developing its rich deep coalfields.

Currently, at the Laohutai, Longfeng, and Shengli coal mines, seven inclined shafts for transport, ventilation, and sand injection are being extended deeper and the wellbores are being expanded. The West Vertical Shaft of the Longfeng Mine will also be excavated downwards into the deep coalfield this year. These wellbore extension projects are the first to be initiated in the development of the deep coalfields.

Formal development of the ancient coal mines has been ongoing for half a century. Before liberation, there were theories that the Fushun coal mines were gradually aging. In 1954, the Fushun Mining Bureau, under the guidance of Soviet geological expert Blum, conducted drilling that overturned previous erroneous geological conclusions about the Fushun coalfield. Rich deep new coalfields were discovered in the northern part of the mining area, which was previously thought to be devoid of coal.

The Fushun coalfield has rare, contiguous, extra-thick coal seams. Extending the mining depth of existing mines allows for the opening of new mining areas with an annual coal production of approximately one million tons with a relatively short construction period and less capital investment.

As the coal in the current mining areas of the Fushun coal mines is becoming increasingly scarce, extending the depth of the mines and developing new areas in the deep coalfields is the most urgent task in current capital construction in order to maintain and increase Fushun's coal production.

Currently, the Fushun Mining Bureau's Design Institute is working on the design for the deep-shaft projects. A large number of mine construction personnel gathered by the Fushun Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau will go to projects in other locations this year to learn technology in preparation for the large-scale well construction tasks next year.

### 抚顺开发深部煤田  年产量可达百万吨

    抚顺开发深部煤田
    年产量可达百万吨
    新华社抚顺17日电　煤都抚顺已经开始开发蕴藏丰富的深部煤田。
    现在，老虎台、龙凤和胜利三个煤矿有运输、通风、注砂等七条斜井，正在向深部延深和扩大井筒。龙凤矿西竖井也将在今年向深部煤田往下开凿。这些矿井井筒延深工程，是开拓深部煤田最先动工的工程。
    古老的煤矿正式被开发已经有半世纪的历史。解放以前，抚顺曾经出现过煤矿逐渐衰老的论调。1954年，抚顺矿务局在苏联地质专家布鲁美里指导下进行钻探的结果，推翻了过去对抚顺煤田所作的错误的地质结论，在矿区北部原来认为无煤的地区，发现了丰富的深部新煤田。
    抚顺煤田是少见的毗连的特厚煤层，延长现有矿井开采深度，用较短的建设时间，较少的资金，就可以开辟出年产煤量一百万吨左右的新采煤区域。
    抚顺煤矿现采区的煤越采越少，为了保持和提高抚顺的煤产量，延长矿井深度，在深部煤田开拓新区，是当前基本建设中最紧急的任务。
    目前，抚顺矿务局设计院正在做矿井深部工程的设计。抚顺煤矿基本建设局集结起来的大批矿井建设力量，今年部分人员要到外地的工程中去学习技术，准备迎接明年大规模的建井任务。
