Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 18th: The "Sunday News" reported on the 17th that the American Embassy's aircraft were flying at will without the consent of the Indonesian military authorities. The newspaper called on the Indonesian government to strictly supervise the activities of foreign aircraft in Indonesia.

On the 13th, a seaplane carrying Lieutenant Colonel Smith, the Air Force Attaché of the American Embassy in Indonesia, crashed on the sea surface off Erdam Island, twenty-five miles north of Jakarta. Smith and the other three American military personnel on board have been rescued. The newspaper said that the plane flew to this location without the permission of the Indonesian military authorities.

The newspaper said that Erdam Island is a place for accommodating vagrants, but the most important thing about this island is that it can be used as a smuggling base for arms and other materials. The newspaper expressed doubt about the purpose of the American Embassy's plane going there.

The newspaper said that when Dodd Buller, the leader of the "Islamic Army," launched a rebellion in Aceh, the American Embassy's plane requested to fly there and also requested to fly to the Moluccas region, where there was also rebel activity, but both requests were rejected by the Indonesian Air Force authorities.

In addition, the Indonesian government has discovered that the aircraft of the American and British embassies have violated aviation regulations and has protested against this, but these protests have been completely ignored.

The newspaper pointed out that, in addition to the aircraft of the American Embassy, the aircraft of foreign oil companies such as Bataaf Petroleum Company, Texaco Petroleum Company, and Mobil Oil Company often do not notify the Indonesian Air Force authorities in advance of where they are flying.

The newspaper said that the American and British embassies have owned aircraft since the Dutch colonial era. The United States previously only had Dakota-style aircraft, but later transported amphibious aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 18th: The "Eastern Star Daily" reported today that Amarulla, one of the leaders of the Masjumi Party-led "Anti-Communist Front" and the head of the so-called "Revolutionary Islamic Legion," has been arrested by the military authorities for participating in Lubis' conspiracy and subversive activities.

Amarulla was directly led by Hasibuan, who was recently arrested by the Jakarta Garrison Command. Recent interrogations revealed that Hasibuan, the "Major General" of the "Islamic Army" who was funded by foreign embassies, was the "liaison officer" between the Lubis Group and the "Islamic Army."

    雅加达“星期日新闻”揭露
    美国飞机在印度尼西亚进行阴谋飞行
    卢比斯集团颠覆分子阿马鲁拉被捕
    新华社雅加达18日电　“星期日新闻”17日说，美国大使馆的飞机没有得到印度尼西亚军事当局的同意随意飞行。报纸要求印度尼西亚政府严厉监督在印度尼西亚的外国飞机的活动。
    在13日，一架载着美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆空军武官史密斯中校的水陆两用飞机在雅加达以北二十五英里的厄达姆岛海面降落时失事，史密斯和机上的其他三个美国军人都已经被救起。报纸说，这架飞机飞到这个地方去，并未得到印度尼西亚军事当局的准许。
    报纸说，厄达姆岛是收容流浪者的地方，不过这个岛最重要的是可以被利用作军火等的走私基地。报纸对美国大使馆飞机到那里去的目的表示怀疑。
    报纸说，“伊斯兰教军”首领多德·布鲁在亚齐发动叛乱时，美国使馆的飞机曾经要求飞到那里去，也曾经要求飞到有叛乱活动的摩鹿加地区去，但是都遭到印度尼西亚空军当局的拒绝。
    此外，印度尼西亚政府曾经发现美国和英国使馆的飞机违反航空条例，并且为此提出过抗议，但是这些抗议完全不被理睬。
    报纸指出，除了美国大使馆的飞机以外，巴塔夫石油公司、德士古石油公司和美孚油公司等外国石油企业的飞机飞到什么地方去，也常常事先不通知印度尼西亚空军当局。
    报纸说，美国和英国使馆从荷兰殖民时代起就拥有飞机，美国以前只有达科他式飞机，后来又运来了水陆两用飞机。
    新华社雅加达18日电　“东星报”今天报道，马斯友美党领导的“反共阵线”的头子之一、所谓“革命伊斯兰军团”的首脑阿马鲁拉已经被军事当局逮捕，因为他参与了卢比斯的阴谋和颠覆活动。
    阿马鲁拉是最近被雅加达卫戍司令部逮捕的哈西布安所直接领导的。最近在侦讯中查出，哈西布安这个受外国使馆资助的“伊斯兰教军”的“少将”是卢比斯集团和“伊斯兰教军”之间的“联络官”。
