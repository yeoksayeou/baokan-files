Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: TASS, New York, February 18th: The "National Planning Association," a joint organization of American capitalists and union leaders, has published a booklet discussing the existence of frequent unemployment in some regions of the United States, as well as in the coal mining and textile industries.

The booklet states, "The situation in many cities in the coal mining centers of Pennsylvania, Southern Illinois, and West Virginia is evidence of an increase in unemployment." In fourteen mining towns in Pennsylvania, from 1946 to 1955, 41,000 people were laid off, and only 11,000 found new jobs. In some mining towns, the number of unemployed exceeded one-fifth of the total number of workers. In the coal mining areas of Southern Illinois, by the end of 1953, the number of miners had decreased to 15,000, a decrease of 13,000 compared to three years prior. The situation in this region "has been further aggravated by the depression in local agriculture. According to statistics, the number of farms in this region has decreased by more than 6,000 in the last decade." Many of the bankrupt farmers have been unable to find work.

Frequent unemployment is also growing in New England, especially in some textile industry centers. One of the reasons why many workers lost their jobs is that business owners moved textile companies in these areas to the South, where labor costs are lower.

The booklet states, "Due to the large number of unemployed people in (these) local labor markets, wages have decreased." Employers also hire female labor, whose wages are much lower than those of male workers, and also employ "younger workers." As a result, many laid-off non-youth textile workers are unable to find new jobs.

Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: TASS, New York, February 17th: According to the Los Angeles "Times," in various enterprises in California, on average, one injury accident occurs every twelve seconds of a working day, and one disability accident occurs every fifty-one seconds. Three fatal accidents occur every working day. The newspaper pointed out that a total of 750,000 unfortunate accidents occurred in 1956.

The newspaper pointed out that outdated safety equipment and poor working conditions are the causes of the accidents.

    美国许多行业失业工人增加
    加利福尼亚州去年发生七十五万起不幸事故
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约18日讯：美国资本家和工会领袖的联合组织——“全国计划协会”发表了一个小册子，谈到在美国一些地区以及在煤矿和纺织行业中存在着经常性的失业现象。
    小册子说，“宾夕法尼亚、南伊利诺斯和西弗吉尼亚煤矿中心的许多城市的情况，是失业人数增加的证明。”宾夕法尼亚州十四个矿工市镇里，从1946年到1955年这一期间，有四万一千人被解雇，而只有一万一千人重新得到工作。在有些矿工城镇，失业人数超过全体工人总数的五分之一。在南伊利诺斯各煤矿区，到1953年底，矿工数目减少到一万五千人，比三年前减少了一万三千人。这一地区的情况“由于当地农业的不景气变得更加恶化。据统计，这一地区农场数目最近十年内减少了六千多个。”破产的农民中有许多人未能找到工作。
    新英格兰诺州特别是一些纺织业中心的经常性失业现象也在增长。企业主把这些地区的纺织企业迁往劳动力价格低廉的南方，这是许多工人失去工作的原因之一。
    小册子说，“由于（这些）地方劳动力市场存在着大量失业者，工资减少了。”雇主并且录用比男工的工资要低得多的妇女劳动力，还雇佣“比较年青的工人”。因而更使许多被解雇的非青年纺织工人不能找到新工作。
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社纽约17日讯：据洛杉矶“时报”报道，在加利福尼亚州的各个企业里，平均一个工作日每十二秒要发生一起受伤事故，每五十一秒要发生一起残废事故。每一个工作日要发生三起死亡事故。报纸指出，1956年一共发生七十五万起不幸事故。
    报纸指出，安全设备陈旧，劳动条件恶劣是发生事故的原因。
