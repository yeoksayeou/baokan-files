    The Development of Foreign Trade in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam	
    With the restoration of peace in Indochina, the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam immediately and actively began to restore and develop the national economy. In just over two years, with the restoration and development of agriculture, industry, and transportation, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also achieved remarkable success in developing foreign trade.
    Vietnam is a country rich in resources, with large outputs of rice, coal, cement, timber, rubber, and phosphate. Before the war, it was one of the three largest rice exporting countries in the world, exporting 1.58 million tons annually, accounting for a quarter of the world's rice exports. The world's best quality anthracite coal (produced in the Hongji Coal Mine) is also one of the main wealth of the Vietnamese people, with an average annual output of 2 million tons, most of which is exported. "Hai Phong Cement" from the Portland Company, which was popular in the Far East in the past, is also a major export product of Vietnam, with an annual output of 260,000 tons. These abundant resources are excellent conditions for Vietnam's economy to move towards prosperity and abundance, and also the basis for the development of foreign trade.
    When the French colonialists occupied Vietnam, they cruelly plundered Vietnam's rich resources, leaving the Vietnamese people in a situation where they could not get enough to eat in good years and could only wait to die in bad years. They not only plundered resources and occupied land, but also monopolized the Vietnamese market, extracting the wealth of the Vietnamese people through unequal exchange. In order to seek the highest profits, French monopoly capitalists adopted protection and differential tariffs, so that other countries were subject to various legal restrictions and could not enter its sphere of influence. Through various methods, goods shipped from France to Vietnam fully enjoyed the special privileges of the "suzerain state" and flooded the entire Vietnamese market. In the past, Vietnam's foreign trade was dominated by trade with France and its colonies, which was a source of wealth for French monopoly capitalists. For example, in 1938, exports from Vietnam to France and its colonies accounted for 47% of total exports, while imports accounted for 52% of Vietnam's total imports. Vietnam's foreign trade has always been in surplus, but it has always been in deficit with France and its colonies. This situation fully illustrates the colonial nature of Vietnam's foreign trade in the past.
    With the continuous victories of the Vietnamese people's liberation war and the continuous consolidation and expansion of the liberated areas, the situation of Vietnam's foreign trade has also been constantly changing. In 1950, after winning the battles of Cao Bang and Lang Son, the Vietnamese people not only laid the foundation for victory militarily, but also created conditions for communication with foreign countries economically, and began to grasp the power of their own foreign trade. In February 1952, the Chinese and Vietnamese governments, in the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, signed the first Sino-Vietnamese trade agreement. This was the first trade agreement signed by the Vietnamese people in a century based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The signing of this trade agreement was of particular importance to the economic relations between the two countries. At that time, the Vietnamese people were engaged in a fierce national liberation war, and the French colonialists were carrying out stubborn resistance and barbaric destruction militarily. Economically, they also carried out strict blockades, preventing surplus local specialties from being transported out of the liberated areas, and preventing industrial products and raw materials from being transported into the liberated areas, causing serious hardship to the people in the liberated areas. The enemy thought that this would weaken the will of the Vietnamese people to fight, but just as they were strengthening the blockade, trade relations were established between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and their conspiracy was shattered. Local specialties that had not been sold in northern Vietnam for many years, such as tea, coffee, lacquer, amomum, star anise, tung oil, etc., found sales channels, increasing farmers' incomes. Moreover, through foreign trade, farmers also received urgently needed industrial products, machinery, chemical raw materials, medicines, etc., which improved their lives and greatly encouraged their production enthusiasm. On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, the trade volume between China and Vietnam has been growing year by year. If we take the export trade volume signed by the Vietnam National Trading Company and the China Trading Company in 1952 (excluding small border trade) as 100, then it was 180 in 1953, 320 in 1954, and 730 in 1955. The trade volume between the two countries in 1956 was even greater, estimated to reach 2.5 times that of 1955. The continuous expansion of trade between China and Vietnam has enabled the needs of the people of the two countries to be better met and promoted the peaceful economic development of the two countries.
    The trade relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Soviet Union and other people's democracies have developed rapidly in recent years. In 1955, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam signed trade agreements with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Democratic Germany, and Romania. In 1956, many countries sent trade delegations to Vietnam to discuss trade issues. The trade volume between Vietnam and the Soviet Union in 1956 is estimated to have increased three to six times compared to 1955, and the trade volume with Czechoslovakia has also increased four times.
    By relying on the equal and mutually beneficial trade among the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam can obtain the necessary means of production from these countries and have long-term and reliable sales channels in terms of export materials. This new type of international economic cooperation has freed the foreign trade of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from its past colonial nature. There have been great changes in import and export commodities. In the past, the main commodities exported by Vietnam were rice, corn, coal, rubber, pepper, cement, etc. The imported commodities were some consumer goods and luxury goods, such as cotton fabrics, steel and its products, automobiles, bicycles and their parts, wine, sugar, petroleum products, cosmetics, and flour. Now, many new varieties have been added to the export side, such as tea, wood, coffee, lacquer, amomum, star anise, tung oil, dried fish and shrimp, rattanware, and other handicrafts. The addition of these new varieties is beneficial to the development of the economy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the improvement of the people's lives in this country. In terms of imports, according to the signed contracts, Vietnam has been able to obtain tractors, agricultural machinery, automobiles, kerosene, steel, steel cables, motors, and complete sets of machinery and equipment from the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Hungary, and Democratic Germany. These materials were not provided to industrially backward countries by France and other capitalist countries in the past. Such exchange of materials is of great significance for promoting Vietnam's economic construction.
    The trade relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and capitalist countries on the principle of equality and mutual benefit are also gradually developing. At the last Leipzig Fair, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam signed barter contracts with companies from Egypt, West Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, France, and other countries. The trade relations between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Asian and African countries such as Egypt, Japan, India, and Myanmar are developing. In September 1956, Vietnam and India signed a three-year trade agreement. According to this agreement, Vietnam will export cement, lime, porcelain, etc. in exchange for India's various machines, agricultural tools, various telecommunications equipment, jute, silk, rubber, etc. The varieties of materials exchanged between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and capitalist countries have begun to change. It exports coal in exchange for British rayon, exports cassava, medicinal materials, star anise, fennel oil, etc. in exchange for West German machinery and chemical products, and exports handicrafts and rattanware in exchange for Swiss watches and French machinery and parts. This favorable change for the Vietnamese people is the result of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's implementation of an independent and autonomous foreign policy.
    The development of foreign trade in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is not only of great significance for promoting the prosperity of Vietnam's national economy and improving the people's lives, but also contributes to international economic cooperation and peaceful coexistence among countries. We believe that with the progress of democratic Vietnam's economic construction, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will play a greater role in promoting the development of international trade.

    越南民主共和国对外贸易的发展	曾文博
    印度支那和平恢复以后，越南民主共和国人民立即积极地进行恢复和发展国民经济的工作。在短短的二年多时间内，随着农业、工业和交通运输业的恢复和发展，越南民主共和国在发展对外贸易方面也获得了显著的成就。
    越南是一个物产富饶的国家，大米、煤炭、水泥、木材、橡胶、磷酸盐等产量都很大。战前，它是世界三个最大的大米输出国之一，每年输出达一百五十八万吨，占全世界大米输出量的四分之一。世界品质最好的无烟煤（产于鸿基煤矿），也是越南人民主要财富之一，平均年产达二百万吨，大部分都向外输出。过去畅销远东的普兰公司的“海防水泥”，也是越南主要出口的产品，年产量达二十六万吨。这些丰富的资源，是越南经济走向繁荣富足的优良条件，也是对外贸易发展的基础。
    法国殖民者侵占越南的时候，对越南的丰富资源进行了残酷的掠夺，使越南人民陷于丰年不得温饱、凶年只有待毙的境地。它不仅掠夺资源和占有土地，还垄断了越南的市场，以不等价交换来榨取越南人民的财富。法国垄断资本家为了谋取最高额利润，采取了保护和差别关税的办法，这样一来，其他国家就受着种种法令的限制，无法进入它的势力范围内了。通过种种方法，法国输往越南的货物就完全享受“宗主国”的特权，泻满了整个越南市场。过去越南的对外贸易，是以对法国及其属地贸易占第一位，它是法国垄断资本家发财致富的泉源。如在1938年，越南对法国及其属地的输出占全部输出额47％，输入则占越南全部输入的52％。越南的对外贸易一向都是出超的，但对法国及其属地来说，又总是入超的。这种情况，充分说明了过去越南对外贸易的殖民地性质。
    随着越南人民解放战争的不断胜利和解放区的不断巩固和扩大，越南的对外贸易情况也不断发生变化。1950年，越南人民在赢得高平、谅山战役之后，他们不仅在军事上奠定了胜利的基础，而且在经济上创造出和国外沟通的条件，并开始掌握了自己对外贸易的权力。1952年2月间，中国和越南政府根据友好和互助的精神，签订了第一个中越贸易协定，这是越南人民百年来第一次依据平等互惠原则签订的贸易协定，这个贸易协定的签订，对两国间的经济关系具有特别重要意义。当时，越南人民正在进行激烈的民族解放战争，法国殖民者在军事上进行顽强抵抗和野蛮破坏。在经济上，他们也进行严密的封锁，使解放区里剩余的土特产不能运出来，也不让工业品和原料运进解放区去，使解放区里的人民遭受到严重的困苦。敌人满以为这样就可以达到削弱越南人民斗争的意志了，可是，正当他们加强封锁的时候，中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国两国之间建立了贸易关系，他们的阴谋被粉碎了，越南北部多年找不到销路的土特产，如茶叶、咖啡、漆、砂仁、八角、桐子等，都找到了销路，使农民增加了收入。不仅如此，通过对外贸易，还给农民带来了迫切需要的工业品、机器、化学原料、药品等，改善了他们的生活，大大地鼓舞了他们的生产热情。在平等互利的基础上，中越两国间的贸易额年年增长。我们如果以1952年越南国营贸易公司和中国贸易公司（边境小额贸易不算）签订的出口贸易额为一百的话，那末，1953年则为一百八十，1954年为三百二十，1955年为七百三十。1956年两国间的贸易额更大，估计达到1955年的二点五倍。中越两国贸易的不断扩大，使两国人民的需要得到更大的满足，促进了两国和平经济的发展。
    越南民主共和国同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易关系近年来得到迅速的发展。1955年，越南民主共和国先后和苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、波兰、民主德国、罗马尼亚签订了贸易协定。1956年，很多国家都派遣贸易代表团到越南商谈贸易问题。1956年越南和苏联的贸易额估计比1955年增加三倍到六倍，和捷克斯洛伐克的贸易额也增加四倍。
    由于依靠以苏联为首的社会主义阵营相互间平等互惠的贸易，越南民主共和国就能从这些国家中获得必需的生产资料，并在出口物资方面有了长期可靠的销路。这种新型的国际经济合作使越南民主共和国的对外贸易摆脱了过去的殖民地性质。进出口的商品有很大的变化。过去，越南输出的主要商品是：大米、玉蜀黍、煤、橡胶、胡椒、水泥等。进口的商品是一些消费品和奢侈品，如棉织品、钢铁及其制品、汽车、自行车及其零件、酒、糖、石油产品、化妆品和面粉等。现在出口方面又增加了不少新品种，如茶叶、木材、咖啡、漆、砂仁、八角、桐子、干鱼虾、藤器及其他工艺品。添加了这些新品种，对于发展越南民主共和国的经济和改善这个国家的人民生活是有好处的。从进口方面说，根据已签订的合同，越南已能从苏联、中国、波兰、匈牙利、民主德国得到拖拉机、农业机械、汽车、煤油、钢材、钢缆、电机及成套的机器设备。这些物资，是过去法国及其他资本主义国家所不愿供给工业落后国家的。这样的物资交换，对于促进越南经济建设具有重大的作用。
    越南民主共和国同资本主义国家在平等互利原则上的贸易关系也逐渐开展。在上一次的来比锡博览会上，越南民主共和国已和埃及、西德、瑞士、英国、法国等国的公司签订了换货合同。越南民主共和国和亚非国家如埃及、日本、印度、缅甸等国的贸易关系正在发展中。1956年9月间，越南和印度签订了三年贸易协定，根据这个协定，越南将输出水泥、石灰、瓷器等去换取印度的各种机器、农具、各种电讯器材、麻、丝、橡胶等。越南民主共和国和资本主义国家交换的物资品种已开始变化了，它输出煤炭去换取英国的人造丝，输出木薯、药材、八角、茴油等商品，去换取西德的机器和化学产品，输出工艺品和藤器去换取瑞士的钟表和法国的机器及零件。这种对越南人民有利的变化，是越南民主共和国执行独立自主的外交政策的结果。
    越南民主共和国对外贸易的发展，不仅对促进越南国民经济的繁荣和改善人民生活具有重大的意义，而且有助于国际经济合作和各国间的和平共处。我们相信，随着民主越南经济建设的进展，越南民主共和国将在促进国际贸易的发展方面发挥更大的作用。
