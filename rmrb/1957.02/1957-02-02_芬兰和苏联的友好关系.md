    Friendly Relations Between Finland and the Soviet Union

    On January 30, Finnish Prime Minister Karl-August Fagerholm visited the Soviet Union. This visit, like the visit of Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, to Finland last year, will promote the consolidation of friendship and further development of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Finland.

    The friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Finland is a vivid example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Finland, by resolutely pursuing a policy of peaceful neutrality and good neighborliness, has ensured its national independence and achieved good results in developing a peaceful economy over the past few years.

    In 1948, the Soviet Union and Finland signed a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance for a term of ten years, in which both contracting parties "guarantee the implementation of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of the other country," and Finland stated its "desire not to become involved in disputes between great powers." This treaty was a turning point in Soviet-Finnish relations.

    In September 1955, former Finnish President Paasikivi and then-Prime Minister Kekkonen visited the Soviet Union. The heads of the two countries issued a joint communiqué, which stipulated that the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between the two countries would be extended for twenty years, and that an agreement would be signed for the Soviet Union to abandon the Porkkala Peninsula naval base and withdraw Soviet armed forces from the area. This further strengthened the foundation of the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland.

  Because Finland has pursued a foreign policy of peaceful neutrality, and abided by the provision in the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance that "the contracting parties guarantee not to conclude any alliance against the other party or participate in any coalition," it has been spared from being drawn into the "Cold War" trend after the war. This has not only guaranteed Finland's independence and sovereignty, but also brought great economic benefits to Finland. If we compare Finland's economic situation with that of Denmark and Norway, the difference is very obvious. After Denmark and Norway joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, their direct military expenditures increased dramatically, increasing by seventeen times and thirty-nine times respectively in 1954 compared to pre-war levels, reaching more than 40% of the budget. Under the influence of the Marshall Plan, their economies have become increasingly militarized and gradually become appendages of American industry. However, because Finland has low military expenditure, a larger part of the national finance can be used to restore and develop national industry and peaceful economy.

    In addition, Finland has also received enormous help from the Soviet Union in its economy. In 1950, the Soviet Union reduced the amount of reparations Finland was to pay after the war by 50% (equivalent to 73.7 million US dollars). In 1954 and 1955, the Soviet Union provided Finland with two loans (40 million gold rubles each time) at a preferential interest rate of 2.5% per annum. In 1951 and 1954, the Soviet Union signed two five-year trade agreements with Finland for 1951 to 1955 and 1956 to 1960. According to these agreements, the Soviet Union supplied Finland with important commodities such as grain, oil, sugar, cotton, and machinery equipment; Finnish commodities also found a stable market in the Soviet Union, especially Finland's metal industry, which has been greatly developed due to large orders from the Soviet Union. In 1955, the Soviet Union and Finland also signed an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation, stipulating the mutual exchange of technical experience and achievements in the industrial, agricultural and scientific research sectors.

    In recent years, Finland's trade with China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, the German Democratic Republic and other People's Democratic countries has also developed. The total trade volume between Finland and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has accounted for more than a quarter of Finland's total foreign trade. Finland's trade with the socialist market is conducive to the stability of its domestic economy, and enables it to purchase raw materials that are lacking in the capitalist market, such as coal, oil, fuel, and so on.

    Under these circumstances, Finland's industrial production has developed relatively quickly after the war. If the total value of industrial production in 1948 is 100, the industrial production index reached 133 in 1953, 143 in 1954, and 153 in 1955.

    However, the implementation of Finland's policy of peaceful neutrality and good neighborliness, which is in line with national interests, has undergone sharp struggles. Imperialists often use various provocative means to undermine the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland. The reactionary forces in Finland also attempted to change the current foreign policy of peaceful neutrality and demanded revisions to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance. These attempts by the imperialists and Finnish reactionaries have been unanimously condemned by the Finnish people and enlightened politicians. The current President Kekkonen has repeatedly condemned those forces that attempt to change the policy of peaceful neutrality and good neighborliness. He said: "Only by faithfully following the current foreign policy can we consolidate our country's position, freedom, and independence."

    Kekkonen was elected President of the Republic of Finland in the presidential election in March 1956. This election result was a victory for the patriotic people of Finland and the forces advocating a policy of peaceful neutrality. This victory further strengthened the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland. President Kekkonen emphasized at the closing session of the Finnish Parliament on December 21, 1956, that the most important task of Finnish foreign policy is to be concerned about its relations with the Soviet Union. He said: Finnish-Soviet relations will continue to be good and will continue to be based on mutual trust. (Wu Hu)

    芬兰和苏联的友好关系
    1月30日，芬兰总理卡尔—奥古斯特·法格霍姆到苏联访问。这次访问，同去年苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫对芬兰的访问一样，将促进苏芬两国友谊的巩固和合作的进一步发展。
    苏联和芬兰之间的友好合作关系，是不同社会制度的国家和平共处的一个生动范例。芬兰由于坚决执行了和平中立和睦邻的政策，几年来保障了国家的独立并在发展和平经济等方面取得良好的成就。
    1948年，苏联同芬兰签订了为期十年的友好合作互助条约，缔约双方都“保证执行互相尊重主权与领土完整，互不干涉对方国家内政之原则”，芬兰并且表明了它“不涉入大国纠纷的愿望”。这个条约是苏芬关系的转折点。
    1955年9月，芬兰前任总统巴锡基维和当时的总理吉科宁曾访问苏联，苏芬两国首脑发表了会谈公报，其中规定将两国友好合作互助条约延长二十年，同时签订了苏联放弃使用波卡拉半岛海军基地和从这个地区撤退苏联武装部队的协定。这更加强了苏芬之间的友好关系的基础。
  由于芬兰执行了和平中立的外交政策，遵守友好合作互助条约中关于“缔约双方保证不得签订任何反对另一方之联盟或参加联合”的规定，它在战后得免于被卷入“冷战”的逆流。这不仅保障了芬兰的独立和主权，而且使芬兰在经济上也得到了很大的好处。如果拿芬兰的经济情况同丹麦、挪威两国的经济情况来比较，差别就是很明显的。丹麦和挪威参加了北大西洋公约集团后，直接军费大量增加，在1954年比战前分别增加了十七倍和三十九倍，达到预算的40％以上。在马歇尔计划的影响下，它们的经济日益军事化并且逐渐成为美国工业的附属品。但是，芬兰因为军费开支少，国家财政的较大部分就可以用来恢复和发展民族工业和和平经济。
    除此而外，芬兰在经济上还得到了苏联的巨大帮助。苏联在1950年将战后芬兰应支付的赔款数目减少了50％（相等于七千三百七十万美元）。在1954年和1955年苏联又先后以年利2.5％的优惠条件提供芬兰两次贷款（每次为四千万金卢布）。1951年和1954年苏联先后同芬兰签订了1951年到1955年和1956年到1960年两个五年贸易协定。根据这些协定，苏联供给芬兰以谷物、石油、糖、棉花、机器装备等重要商品；芬兰的商品也在苏联找到了稳定的市场，特别是芬兰的金属工业由于苏联的大量订货而得到了很大的发展。1955年，芬苏两国还签订了科学技术合作协定，规定相互交流工农业和科学研究部门的技术经验和成就。
    几年来，芬兰与中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国等人民民主国家的贸易也有了发展。芬兰和苏联及各人民民主国家的贸易总额已占到芬兰对外贸易总额的四分之一以上，芬兰和社会主义市场的贸易有利于它国内经济的稳定，并且使它可以从社会主义市场上购买到资本主义市场上所缺乏的原料物资，如煤、石油、油料等等。
    在这种情况下，芬兰的工业生产在战后发展是比较快的。如果以1948年工业生产总值为一百，1953年工业生产的指数就达到一百三十三，1954年达到一百四十三，1955年达到一百五十三。
    但是，芬兰这种符合民族利益的和平中立与睦邻政策的得以执行，是经过了尖锐斗争的。帝国主义者经常用各种挑拨手段来破坏苏芬之间的友好关系。芬兰国内的反动势力也企图改变现行的和平中立的外交政策，并要求修改友好合作互助条约，帝国主义者和芬兰反动派的这种企图遭到了芬兰人民及开明政治家们的一致谴责。现任总统吉科宁曾一再指责那些企图改变和平中立和睦邻政策的势力，他说：“只有忠实地追随现行的外交政策，我们才能巩固我国的地位、自由和独立。”
    吉科宁是在1956年3月的总统选举中被选为芬兰共和国总统的。这个选举结果是芬兰的爱国人民和主张执行和平中立政策的力量的胜利。这一胜利进一步加强了苏芬的友好关系。吉科宁总统在1956年12月21日的芬兰议会闭幕会上强调指出，芬兰外交政策中最重要的任务是关心它同苏联的关系。他说：芬苏关系将继续是良好的，继续是以相互信任为基础的。　（吴湖）
