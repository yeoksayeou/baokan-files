Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, February 2nd. Premier Zhou Enlai addressed members of the Sri Lankan Senate and House of Representatives at 9:00 AM on February 1st in the lounge of the Sri Lankan House of Representatives.

Although the Parliament was in recess, about seventy of the one hundred and twenty members came to this magnificent building to meet with Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai mentioned the long-standing ties between China and Sri Lanka and the national independence struggles both countries had waged in the past. Referring to the earlier trade agreement between the two countries, he said, "We cannot forget the help you gave us through this agreement during China's difficult days." The Premier also thanked Sri Lanka for its support in restoring China's legitimate status in the United Nations. He noted with satisfaction that the relations between the two countries had been further developed in the past year or two. He also mentioned the visit of the Sri Lankan government delegation to China and the visit of the Chinese trade delegation to Sri Lanka. He said, "After the mutual exchange of diplomatic envoys, the friendly relations between our two countries will certainly be further developed."

He advocated that the two countries, together with all other African and Asian countries, should learn from each other and help each other in their national construction work.

Premier Zhou Enlai praised Sri Lanka's policy of peace, neutrality, and anti-colonialism. He said: "We have always believed that friendly cooperation between countries with different political systems on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit is in the interests of the people of Sri Lanka, and also in the interests of the unity of African and Asian countries and world peace. We have always believed that all countries, regardless of size or strength, are equal and have the right to pursue their own independent policies."

Zhou Enlai said that after visiting ten countries in Asia and Europe, he deeply felt the strong desire for peace among the people of all these countries. He said, "The people want peace, and the forces of peace are strong. The people of the world should unite and strive for the noble cause of promoting world peace and cooperation."

Prime Minister Bandaranaike thanked Premier Zhou Enlai for his speech to the Sri Lankan parliamentarians. He said, "The grand welcome received by the Premiers of the People's Republic of China yesterday must have shown you that, no matter what differences exist between our two countries, the people of Sri Lanka have friendly feelings towards China, and this welcome was even warmer than the welcome given to any other guest in our country before."

Bandaranaike reiterated the current Sri Lankan government's policy towards China, saying, "We may have differences in ideology or other aspects, but we have no reason to be hostile to each other." He said that not only that, but we should also try to understand each other, understand these differences, and maintain friendly and close relations with each other in order to safeguard world peace.

He said that Premier Zhou Enlai's similar views also expressed the opinions in the hearts of the Sri Lankan people. The Sri Lankan Prime Minister praised China as a "great country" and recounted the cultural, religious, trade, and other relations between Sri Lanka and China over many centuries. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit "is precisely at a time when everyone needs to contribute to resolving world disputes." He gave a high evaluation of the role that China can play in the world situation.

The Chinese guests, accompanied by the staff, visited the Parliament Hall and the Library. Zhou Enlai and He Long discussed the Sri Lankan parliamentary system and the role of China's People's Congress system with the Speaker of the Parliament, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Industry. Gong Peng, Director of the Information Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spoke with a female parliamentarian who told her that there are three female parliamentarians in the Sri Lankan Parliament and a female Minister of Health in the government.

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Prime Minister Bandaranaike at the Prime Minister's Office in the Senate Building and held talks with him.

    中锡两国总理向锡兰议员表示共同的愿望
    强调进一步发展中锡友好关系
    新华社科伦坡2日电　周恩来总理1日上午九点钟在锡兰众议院休息室内向参议员和众议员们发表了讲话。
    虽然议会正在休会期间，一百二十名议员中仍有七十名左右到这座雄伟的建筑物里来同周恩来总理和贺龙副总理会面。
    周恩来总理在讲话中提到中锡两国悠久的联系和两国过去所进行的民族独立斗争。他在提到早先两国所缔结的换货协定时说：“我们不能忘记你们在中国处在艰苦日子里的时候通过这项协定所给我们的帮助。”总理还感谢锡兰在恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位问题上给予中国的支持。他满意地指出两国的关系在过去一两年间得到了进一步的发展。他并且提到锡兰政府代表团对中国的访问和中国贸易代表团到锡兰的访问。他说：“在互派外交使节以后，我们两国的友好关系一定会得到进一步发展”。
    他主张两国在进行国家建设工作方面应该同所有其他非洲和亚洲国家一起互相学习，互相帮助。
    周恩来总理赞扬锡兰所奉行的和平、中立和反殖民主义的和平独立政策。他说：“我们一向认为，具有不同政治制度的国家在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上进行友好合作，是符合锡兰人民的利益的，也是符合于非洲亚洲国家团结和世界和平的利益的。我们一向认为，一切国家不论大小强弱都是平等的，都是有权实行它们自己的独立政策的。”
    周恩来说，在访问过亚洲和欧洲的十个国家以后，他深深感到所有这些国家的人民希望和平的强烈愿望。他说：“人民要和平，和平力量是强大的。全世界人民应该团结起来为促进世界和平和合作的崇高事业而奋斗。”
    班达拉奈克总理感谢周恩来总理对锡兰议员们的讲话。他说：“中华人民共和国总理们昨天受到的盛大欢迎一定已经使你们看到，不论我们两国之间存在着什么分歧，锡兰人民对中国是怀有友好感情的，这次欢迎比我国以前对任何其他客人的欢迎都更加热烈。”
    班达拉奈克重申了锡兰现政府对中国的政策，他说：“在意识形态方面或者其他方面，我们可能有分歧，但是我们没有理由要互相敌视。”他说，不但如此，我们还应该设法互相了解，了解这些分歧，并且互相保持友好亲密的关系，以便保障世界和平。
    他说，周恩来总理所表示的类似看法也正是表达了锡兰人民心中的意见。锡兰总理称赞中国是“伟大的国家”，并且追述了许多世纪以来锡、中两国之间在文化、宗教、贸易和其他方面的关系。他说，周恩来总理的访问“正是在极其需要大家为解决世界纠纷而贡献力量的时候”。他对中国能够在世界局势中起的作用给了极高的评价。
    中国客人们在招待人员的陪同下参观了议会大厅和图书馆。周恩来和贺龙同议会议长、反对派领袖以及财政部长和工业部长交谈了锡兰的议会制度和中国的人民代表大会制度的作用。中国外交部新闻司司长龚澎同一位女议员谈了话，这位女议员告诉她说，锡兰议会中有三个女议员，政府中有一位女卫生部长。
    随后，周恩来总理到参议院大厦总理办公室拜会了班达拉奈克总理，并且同他进行了会谈。
