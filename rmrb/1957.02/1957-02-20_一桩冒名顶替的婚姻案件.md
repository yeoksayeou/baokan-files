    A Case of Marriage by Impersonation
    Wen Wu
    On October 2nd of last year, a young "couple" came to the Naxi County People's Court in Sichuan Province to request a "divorce." The woman was heavily pregnant, looking like she was about to give birth. An assistant judge from the court came out to hear the case.

    "My name is He Yinchao, from Quba Township, and I'm here to divorce You Fucheng," the woman said, handing over a letter of introduction from the township.

    The assistant judge looked at the letter of introduction and then turned to the man, asking:

    "Are you You Fucheng?"

    "Yes."

    "Your wife is asking for a divorce. Do you agree?"

    "She's committed adultery. I agree to the divorce," he replied without hesitation.

    "Are you about to give birth?" the judge turned back to the woman.

    "More than seven months along, almost ready."

    "How will the child issue be resolved after the divorce?"

    The man replied, "She can have it, I can have it, either way."

    "I'll raise it until it's two years old," the woman added.

    "I'll give her forty yuan as the child's living expenses for two years," the man immediately stated his position.

    The assistant judge thought: both parties have agreed, so there must be no problem. Therefore, she didn't ask about other circumstances, such as the state of their relationship, who the woman had committed adultery with, or whether there was any possibility of reconciliation, and immediately concluded:

    "Alright, since you both have no objections, go to the district office to get your divorce certificate!"

    Then she called the Chengjiao District Office and said that the court had approved the divorce of You Fucheng and his wife. She instructed the district office to immediately process their divorce.

    Half a month later, this divorced "couple" registered their marriage with the Quba Township People's Committee. The woman was still named He Yinchao, but the man had changed his name to Liu Shaoyun. The township cadres saw the divorce certificate, knew that He Yinchao and You Fucheng were "divorced," and agreed to their marriage. In this way, these two became a "legal" couple.

    The next morning, a farmer ran breathlessly to the court to complain. He said, "What's going on with your court! I didn't even know I was being divorced, and now my wife has married someone else." This farmer was the real You Fucheng.

    You Fucheng and He Yinchao were married in 1952. After the marriage, their relationship was harmonious. In August 1955, Liu Shaoyun, a neighbor in the same courtyard, used methods such as giving gifts and treating them to meals to seduce He Yinchao into committing adultery. From then on, the relationship between He Yinchao and You Fucheng gradually deteriorated. Later, He Yinchao filed for divorce. The Quba Township People's Committee's mediation was ineffective, so they were referred to the county court for resolution. After He Yinchao received the letter of introduction, she and Liu Shaoyun discussed stealing You Fucheng's personal seal, and Liu Shaoyun impersonated You Fucheng and went with her to the Naxi County People's Court to complete the divorce proceedings.

    Originally, this deception was easy to expose. However, these two went through the county People's Court, the district office, and the township People's Committee, successfully completing the "divorce" and "marriage" farce. It wasn't until You Fucheng exposed the deception that the Naxi County People's Court annulled the illegal marriage between Liu and He and gave them the punishment they deserved.

    This is a small matter, but for comrades who have a subjective work style of not conducting investigation and research, it is a profound satire.

    一桩冒名顶替的婚姻案件
    文武
    去年10月2日，有一对青年“夫妇”到四川省纳溪县人民法院要求“离婚”。女的大着肚子，看样子快要分娩了。法院出来一位助理审判员来审理这个案件。
    “我叫何银超，是渠坝乡人，来跟游福成离婚。”女的一边说，一边拿出乡上的介绍信。
    这位助理审判员将介绍信看了一下，又转问男方：
    “你叫游福成吗？”
    “嗯。”
    “你妻子提出跟你离婚，你同意吗？”
    “她和人通奸，我同意离婚。”他毫不犹豫地回答。
    “快生小孩了吗？”审判人员又回过头来问女方。
    “已经七个多月，快生了。”
    “离婚后，小孩问题怎样解决？”
    男的回答：“她要，我要，都可以。”
    “我养两岁。”女的接着说。
    “我给她四十元，作为小孩两年的生活费。”男的又立刻表示了自己的态度。
    这位助理审判员认为：双方都已经同意，一定没有问题了。于是，对其他情况，如双方感情如何，女的跟甚么人通奸，双方感情是否还有恢复的可能等等，都没有讯问，就立刻作出结论：
    “好吧，你们双方都无意见，就到区公所去扯离婚证吧！”
    接着她又向城郊区区公所打了一个电话，说法院同意游福成夫妇离婚。并通知区公所立即给他们办理离婚手续。
    半个月以后，这一对离了婚的“夫妇”，又向渠坝乡人民委员会登记结婚。女的仍名何银超，男的却改名为刘少云了。乡干部看了离婚证，知道何银超和游福成已经“离婚”，就同意他们结婚。这样，这两个人就成了“合法”夫妇了。
    第二天早上，一个农民气喘吁吁地跑到法院喊冤。他说：“你们法院怎么搞的！我还不晓得就给我判决离婚了。现在，我妻子已经跟别人结婚了。”这个农民就是真正的游福成。
    游福成和何银超是在1952年结婚的。婚后，夫妻感情和睦。1955年8月，同院邻居刘少云用送东西、下饭馆等手段，引诱何银超通奸。从此何银超和游福成的感情逐渐破裂。后来何银超提出离婚。渠坝乡人民委员会调解无效，就介绍他们到县法院去解决。何银超得到介绍信以后，就和刘少云商议，将游福成的私章偷出，由刘少云冒名顶替游福成，两人一起去到纳溪县人民法院办了离婚手续。
    本来，这个骗局是很容易识破的。可是，这两个人却经过了县人民法院、区公所和乡人民委员会，顺利地演完了“离婚”而又“结婚”的把戏。直到这个骗局被游福成揭穿，纳溪县人民法院才撤销了刘、何二人的非法婚姻关系，并给他们以应得的处分。
    这是一件小事，但是对于有着不进行调查研究的主观主义作风的同志，它却是一个深刻的讽刺。
