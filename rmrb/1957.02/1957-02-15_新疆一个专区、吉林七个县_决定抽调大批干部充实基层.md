Xinjiang's Aksu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a three-level cadre meeting to discuss the issue of streamlining institutions and reducing expenditures throughout the region.

The meeting held that the current institutions in the entire prefecture were oversized and top-heavy. The prefectural-level organs alone had 44 units with nearly a thousand cadres. The personnel of companies dealing with monopolies, pharmaceuticals, and textiles all exceeded their established quotas. Over 56% of the departments under the Commissioner's Office had staff exceeding their authorized numbers. Many cadres in many units had nothing to do and were idle. Conversely, the rural areas had fewer cadres with lower skill levels, which could not keep up with the rapid development of collectivization. Due to the increase in departments, the number of matters for the Party Committee to study and decide on had also greatly increased, sometimes leading to an excess of meetings, making it difficult for leading cadres to find enough time to go deep into reality and inspect and discover problems.

The meeting held that the entire prefecture should immediately begin streamlining institutions and put forward preliminary opinions for relevant organs to study and handle. First, reduce the internal levels of the organs. All departments within the Party Committee, except for the sections of the General Office, should be abolished. The Commissioner's Office should abolish six sections (bureaus, banks, associations). Second, the Party Committee's planned Culture and Education and Industry Departments, and the Commissioner's Office's Personnel and Establishment Sections, should no longer be established. The farms and ranches, as well as transportation and road maintenance sections, managed by the Special District should be handed over to the counties to which they belong. After this streamlining, it is initially estimated that about 300 people can be streamlined and sent to strengthen grassroots organizations.

In order to adapt to the needs of rural work development, Huaide, Jiaohe, Jiutai, Panshi, Dunhua, Shulan, Yitong and other counties are currently transferring large numbers of capable cadres to strengthen grassroots leadership work.

Before making this decision, the county party committees conducted relatively thorough investigations and studies of the current rural work situation. They unanimously believed that since the merger of districts and the division of townships, two unreasonable situations have arisen: on the one hand, due to the upward transfer of most cadres, the county-level leading organs were large and overstaffed, which fostered bureaucracy and paperwork; on the other hand, because most of the main cadres in the townships were promoted from the original village cadres, their levels were low and they had little experience, so they could not handle the complex and varied problems in the countryside well. According to the investigation by the Huaide County Committee of the Communist Party of China, two-thirds of the 392 township cadres in the county were promoted from the villages at the time of the township merger; only three of the township cadres had the equivalent of a junior high school education, the vast majority of comrades were only barely literate, and some were illiterate.

In order to change this situation, the above-mentioned seven counties decided to transfer 469 cadres to strengthen grassroots leadership. Among them, 74 are deputy county heads, members of the county party committee, heads and deputy heads of the county party committee departments, and heads and deputy heads of the county people's committee bureaus and sections, and 34 are secretaries and deputy secretaries of the district party committee and heads and deputy heads of the district. The remaining cadres also have many years of experience in rural work.

After the announcement of this decision in each county, it was warmly welcomed by the cadres. After listening to the county party committee's report on sending cadres down to strengthen grassroots leadership, 90% of the cadres in the Jiutai County directly affiliated organs submitted applications to the Party, requesting to work in the countryside.

### 新疆一个专区、吉林七个县  决定抽调大批干部充实基层

    新疆一个专区、吉林七个县
    决定抽调大批干部充实基层
    本报讯　中共阿克苏地委最近召开的三级干部会议，讨论了全区精简机构、紧缩开支的问题。
    会议认为，目前全专区机关机构庞大、头重脚轻。仅专区级机关就有四十四个单位，干部近千人。专卖、医药、纺织等公司人员都超过了编制。专署超编制的科室占56％以上。很多单位的不少干部无事可做闲得发慌。但相反的，农村则是干部少、水平低，赶不上合作化猛烈发展的需要。由于部门增多，党委研究决定的事项也大大增加，有时会议泛滥成灾，领导干部很难抽出足够时间深入实际，检查发现问题。
    会议认为，全专区应立即着手精简机构，并提出了初步意见，交有关机关研究办理。第一、减少机关内部层次。地委除秘书处的科外，其余部内的科全部撤销。专署撤销六个科（局、行、会）。第二、准备成立的党委文教、工业两部和专署人事、编制两科不再成立。专区管理的农、牧场和运输、养路段分别交所属县管理。第三、事业企业单位目前可撤销合并七个不急需要的公司。这样紧缩后，初步计算可精简三百人左右去充实基层组织。
    本报讯为了适应农村工作发展的需要，目前怀德、蛟河、九台、磐石、敦化、舒兰、伊通等县，正抽调大批得力的干部，充实基层领导工作。
    这些县在做出这一决定之前，县委对当前的农村工作情况作了比较充分的调查研究。他们一致认为：自从并区划乡以来，就产生了两种不合理的情况，一方面由于大部分干部上调，县级领导机关机构庞大人浮于事，助长了官僚主义和文牍主义的发展；另一方面，因为乡的主要干部多是原来村干部提拔起来的，水平较低，经验很少，因此不能很好地处理农村中纷繁复杂的问题。据中共怀德县委调查，全县三百九十二名乡干部中，有三分之二是并乡时由村里提拔的；在乡干部中相当于初中文化程度的仅有三名，绝大多数同志仅仅粗通文字，还有一部分是文盲。
    为了改变这种状况，上述七个县决定抽调四百六十九名干部充实基层领导。其中副县长、县委委员、县委正副部长以及县人民委员会正副局长、科长级干部七十四名、正副区委书记和正副区长三十四名。其余干部也多具有多年农村工作的经验。
    各县这一决定宣布以后，受到了干部极大的欢迎。九台县直属机关的干部听了县委关于下派干部，加强基层领导的报告以后，有90％的干部向党提交了申请书，要求到农村去工作。
