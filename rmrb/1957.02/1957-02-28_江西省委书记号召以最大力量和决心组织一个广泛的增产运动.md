Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, February 24th: Developing production on the basis of advanced agricultural cooperatives, increasing the income of cooperative members, achieving common prosperity, and striving to enable farmers throughout Jiangxi Province to reach the living standards of prosperous middle peasants within two to three years. This is the call made by Yang Shangkui, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, to agricultural cooperatives throughout the province at the Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Representatives Conference on the 21st.

Yang Shangkui said that the province's total grain output is planned to reach approximately 14 billion jin this year (approximately 13 billion jin last year), the total cotton output is planned to reach 440,000 dan of ginned cotton (375,000 dan last year), the total oil crop output is planned to reach 3.9 million dan, the number of live pigs is planned to reach 4 million, and correspondingly increase the production of various other cash crops and develop rural sideline production. To this end, the entire province must organize a broader and more enthusiastic production increase campaign than last year with maximum strength and determination.

In analyzing the conditions for agricultural production in Jiangxi Province this year, Yang Shangkui said that it is entirely possible to achieve this year's plan. He pointed out that last year, cadres lacked experience in leading collective production, farmers lacked the habit of collective production, and some areas suffered severe natural disasters, but the province's total grain output still exceeded the bumper harvest of 1955, about 75% of agricultural cooperatives increased production, and about 75% of cooperative members increased income. In some agricultural cooperatives with better management and without natural disasters, the number of members whose income increased reached 85% to 90%, or even more than 90%. This year, 96% of farmers throughout the province have joined advanced cooperatives, and some experience in large-scale production has been accumulated. There is still great potential for increasing production in agriculture throughout the province. At present, the average grain yield per mu in the province is only over 300 jin, while some high-yield areas have reached about 1,000 jin; the average cotton yield per mu is only over 30 jin of ginned cotton, while some high-yield areas have reached more than 100 jin. The multiple cropping index of the province's land is still relatively low, and there are a large number of barren hills and wasteland that can be gradually developed and utilized. There are also many avenues for rural sideline occupations, especially in mountainous areas where resources are abundant, but have not been well developed in the past. Now, the realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization throughout the province has created conditions for fully exploiting the potential for increased production.

Yang Shangkui also talked about some problems in completing this year's agricultural production plan. He said that due to last year's drought, there are certain difficulties in this year's spring plowing preparation work. However, as long as we seize the opportunity and redouble our efforts, we can overcome the difficulties. At present, some cadres and farmers still have some incorrect understandings of agricultural cooperativization, which affects their confidence and enthusiasm in completing this year's agricultural production plan. It is necessary to patiently conduct propaganda and education to help them strengthen their confidence and increase their enthusiasm for production.

In order to complete this year's production increase task and strive for an all-round bumper harvest, Yang Shangkui called on all agricultural cooperatives throughout the province to further strengthen management and continue to implement the principles of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and democratically. He said that in formulating this year's production plan, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of "developing diversified operations and comprehensively developing production on the basis of ensuring increased production of grain and cotton," and properly arrange the household sideline production of cooperative members, so as to both ensure the completion of the state plan and increase the income of cooperative members from all aspects. It is necessary to rationally arrange and use labor, and do a good job of labor planning for the whole society throughout the year and in stages. In addition to areas where women's labor is relatively strong and have the habit of engaging in agricultural labor, they should generally be organized to do a good job in sideline production and housework. Within the agricultural cooperative, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of "each according to his ability, distribution according to work," and the method is to gradually implement work quotas. Each cooperative must implement a contract system, and actively and steadily promote the system of contracting for work and output. Advanced experience in increasing production and technological reforms should still be actively and steadily promoted step by step, adapting to local conditions and the times. While ensuring increased production in agricultural cooperatives, it is also necessary to pay attention to practicing strict economy.

Yang Shangkui finally requested that all agricultural cooperatives fully prepare for spring plowing. He proposed that a general inspection of spring plowing preparation work be carried out recently, and competitions be launched between societies and between teams, and to make a concentrated effort to complete tasks such as repairing water conservancy facilities and accumulating fertilizer. He also encouraged all agricultural labor models to always maintain a humble and cautious attitude, guard against arrogance and complacency, closely connect with the masses, and continue to play a leading and backbone role in various tasks, leading the masses to strive to complete this year's production increase task.

    江西省委书记号召以最大力量和决心组织一个广泛的增产运动
    新华社南昌24日电　在农业高级合作化的基础上发展生产，增加社员收入，做到共同富裕，并且努力争取在两三年内使江西全省农户能够达到富裕中农的生活水平。这是中共江西省委员会书记杨尚奎21日在江西省农业劳动模范代表大会上向全省农业社所作的号召。
    杨尚奎说，全年江西省计划粮食总产量达到一百四十亿斤左右（去年一百三十亿斤左右），棉花总产量达到皮棉四十四万担（去年三十七万五千担），油料作物总产量达到三百九十万担，毛猪达到四百万头，以及相应地增产其他各种经济作物和发展农村副业生产。为此，全省必须以最大的力量和决心，组织一个比去年更加广泛更加热烈的增产运动。
    杨尚奎在分析江西省今年农业生产的条件时说，实现今年的计划是完全可能的。他指出，去年干部还缺乏领导集体生产的经验，农民也缺乏集体生产的习惯，有些地区还遭到严重的自然灾害，但是全省粮食总产量仍超过了丰收的1955年，75％左右的农业社增加了生产，75％左右的社员增加了收入。一些经营管理较好，又未遭受自然灾害的农业社，增加收入的社员达到85％到90％，甚至在90％以上。今年全省已经有96％的农户参加了高级社，而且已经积累了一些大生产的经验。全省在农业生产上，还存在着巨大的增产潜力。目前全省的粮食每亩平均产量只有三百多斤，而有些高产地区却达到了一千斤左右；棉花每亩平均产量只有皮棉三十多斤，而有些高产地区却达到了一百多斤。全省土地的复种指数还比较低，并且有大量的荒山荒地可以逐步开发利用。农村的副业门路也很广，尤其是山区资源丰富，过去还没有很好开发。现在全省农业高级合作化的实现，已经为充分发挥增产潜力创造了条件。
    杨尚奎也谈到完成今年农业生产计划中的一些问题。他说，由于去年干旱，今年备耕工作有一定的困难。但是只要抓紧时机，加倍努力，就可以克服困难。目前有些干部和农民对农业合作化还存在一些不正确的认识，以致影响到完成今年农业生产计划的信心和热情。这就必须耐心地宣传教育，帮助他们坚定信心和提高生产积极性。
    为了完成今年的增产任务，争取全面大丰收，杨尚奎号召全省各农业社进一步加强经营管理，继续贯彻勤俭办社、民主办社方针。他说，在制订今年的生产计划中，要认真贯彻“在保证粮棉增产的基础上，开展多种经营，全面发展生产”的方针，并且妥善安排社员的家庭副业生产，以达到既保证完成国家计划，又从各方面使社员增加收入。要合理地安排和使用劳动力，做好全社全年的和分季分期的劳动规划。除妇女劳动力较强、又有从事农业劳动习惯的地区外，一般来说要组织她们搞好副业生产和家务劳动。农业社内部要坚决贯彻“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的分配原则，办法是逐步实行工作定额。每个社都要实行包工制，并且积极稳步地推广包工包产制。对于先进的增产经验和技术改革，仍要因地因时制宜，积极而稳重地逐步加以推广。在保证农业社增产的同时，还必须注意厉行节约。
    杨尚奎最后要求各农业社在当前充分做好各项备耕工作。他提出，在最近对备耕工作普遍检查一次，开展社和社、队和队之间的评比竞赛，突击完成整修水利、积肥等工作。他还勉励全体农业劳动模范经常保持虚心谨慎态度，力戒骄傲自满，密切联系群众，在各项工作中继续发挥带头、骨干作用，带领群众努力完成今年的增产任务。
