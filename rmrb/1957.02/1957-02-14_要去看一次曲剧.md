    Must See a Quju Opera Performance
    Chen Mengjia

    On the third evening of the Lunar New Year, I watched a new grand opera adapted and performed by the Beijing Quyi Troupe at the Qianmen Small Theater – "Yang Naiwu and Little Cabbage." This is a true story from the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, and is a very popular story in our Zhejiang folklore. I often heard my mother tell it when I was a child, but this was the first time I saw it performed as an opera. This six-act, twelve-scene opera was performed wonderfully and successfully, making us feel without hesitation that Quju opera can perform excellent plays, even if borrowing scripts from other opera genres.

    The leading actress, Wei Xikui’s, gifted voice and talent for performing tragic characters made this opera very moving. The continuous and tireless singing of the other leading actor, Li Baoyan, was also very admirable. Many actors captured the various images of the Qing Dynasty officialdom and the ugly behaviors of various sycophants, with realistic acting. In addition to the music accompanying the lyrics, the music used to create the environmental atmosphere was particularly successful (one could even say creative) in creating some musical scenes. This reminded me of what Wei Xikui told me, that their orchestra developed from the "cages" affiliated with Quyi in the Beijing area. These "cages" were used to hold gongs and drums, and to play music at celebratory gatherings. This folk orchestra, after several years of Quju opera performances, has been able to take on the heavy responsibility of this grand opera with ease.

    Wei Xikui's previous Quju opera performances, such as "Luohan Qian," "Willow Well," and "Women's Representative Zhang Gui Rong," were all able to express human emotion and were therefore moving. Not long ago, they specially trained in stage movements for two scenes of "The Fairy Couple" (Encounter on the Road and Farewell). The image in the "Encounter on the Road" scene was very beautiful, and the setting was excellent. This performance of "Yang Naiwu and Little Cabbage" is a step forward in that its operatic quality has been strengthened. The subtle details of the scenery and costumes are also very carefully done. In just a few years, the Quju Troupe has made great progress through hard work and refusing to bow to difficulties. I admire their efforts and achievements.

    We should applaud such a new theater group. It is a genuine Beijing local opera, developed from the original Beijing local Quyi and orchestras. The evolution from a one-person performance to a large-scale opera with many characters is the path that many local operas have taken. Therefore, we should acknowledge that Quju opera has a future. They will soon be performing "A Laughing-Stock Marriage," which will surely be another excellent example of their talent. We also hope that Wei Xikui's "Dream of the Red Chamber" drum ballad, which she sings so gently and movingly, can one day become a grand opera.

    I have seen many local operas, and the expressions and singing artistry of many actors make me very proud to be Chinese, and very fortunate to be Chinese, to be able to appreciate so many flowers, new flowers blossoming from old roots. Among them, I particularly admire the voices and expressions of Chang Xiangyu and Wei Xikui, and I feel that they have a very high level of operatic skill. Henan opera is an older genre, with readily available good scripts and a wider audience; Quju opera is a new genre, and the scripts are still being created, but it has already achieved such results, which is even more commendable.

    I won’t talk about the content of the Quju Troupe's performance this time, readers can go see it for themselves, you must go see it once. Let me repeat what the old Quju artist Gu Rongfu said, "Our Quju opera is a small, tender flower, unable to withstand strong winds and heavy rains, everyone should cultivate it more." Let the applause and opinions of our Beijing audience be their sunshine and fine rain, this Beijing flower will surely bloom even better. I wish them greater success! (Attached picture)

    要去看一次曲剧
    陈梦家
    初三晚上，在前门小剧场看了北京曲艺团改编演出的一出新的大戏——杨乃武小白菜。这是清末光绪年间的一件真事，在我们浙江民间最为流行的故事。我从小常听母亲讲，但看它演出成戏，还是第一次。这六幕十二场的大戏，演得很精彩，很成功，使我们毫不犹豫地觉得曲剧可以演出很好的戏，那怕是借用别的剧种的剧本。
    主演者魏喜奎的天赋歌喉和善于表演悲剧的性格，使这出戏十分动人。另一男主角李宝岩自始至终紧密不懈的演唱，也是十分使人赞叹的。许多演员揣摩了清季官场的种种形象，各种帮闲的丑态，在表演动作上都很现实。除了陪衬唱词的音乐以外，这一次烘托环境空气的音乐，特别成功地（也可以说创造性的）创造了一些音乐的场面。这使我记得魏喜奎对我说的，他们的乐班是北京一带附属于曲艺的“笼子”所发展的。这些“笼子”就是装锣鼓家伙、在喜庆堂会上敲打的。这个出生于民间的乐班，经过了最近几年曲剧的演奏，已经能很从容地担负起这出大戏的重任了。
    魏喜奎以前所主演的曲剧罗汉钱、柳树井和妇女代表张桂容等，都很能表现出人情味，因此使人感动。在不久以前，他们为了排演天仙配的两折（路遇与告别）特别锻炼了身段。在路遇一折中，形象很美，布景很好。这一次演出的杨乃武小白菜，比以前进了一步的是它的戏曲性加强了。布景和服装的细微处也很用心。曲剧团在短短几年中间，经过坚苦奋斗，不向困难低头，因而有了很多的进步。他们这种努力与成就使我佩服。
    为这样一个新生的剧团，我们应该鼓掌。它是地道的北京的地方戏，从北京地方原有的曲艺和乐班发展起来的。从一个人演戏发展为许多角色的大戏，是许多地方戏走过的道路。因此，我们应该承认，曲剧是有前途的。他们不久将要演出“啼笑姻缘”，一定更能现身说法地演出好戏。我们也希望唱得那么委婉动人的魏喜奎的红楼梦鼓词，有一天也能成为大戏。
    我看到许多地方戏，有许多演员的表情和演唱艺术，使我很骄傲是一个中国人，很幸运是一个中国人，能同时欣赏许多花，老根上发出的新花。这其中，我特别欣赏常香玉和魏喜奎的歌喉和表情，觉得她们有很高的歌剧的水平。豫剧是一个年代较久的剧种，有现成的好剧本，也有较广大的观众；曲剧是一种新的剧种，剧本还在创造之中，已经有了这样的成绩，是更难能可贵了。
    关于曲剧团此次演出的内容，此地不说了，读者可以自己去看，是要去看一次的。我把曲剧老艺人顾荣甫的话学一遍吧。他说，咱们这个曲剧是朵小小的嫩花，经不起狂风暴雨，大家多栽培一些。让我们北京观众的掌声和意见，作他们的阳光和细雨，这朵北京花一定能开得更好。我预祝他们更大的成功！（附图片）
