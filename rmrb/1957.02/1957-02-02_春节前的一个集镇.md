    Recently, I took a boat to Huangdai Town, a commercial center of Wuxian County, more than 20 miles outside of Suzhou, to visit. In the wake of the bumper harvest year, this rural primary market appeared even more prosperous before the Spring Festival. The cotton cloth shops in the town were crowded with farmers buying cloth. Shi A'qiao, a female member of the Hongxing Fourteenth Cooperative of Liubu Township, came with her daughter-in-law to the jointly-owned, state-private Zhen De Second Retail Department and bought more than six lengths of patterned gabardine, white fine cloth, blue nankeen, and a cotton batting weighing more than seven catties in one go. Cai Qiaojin, a member of the Eleventh Cooperative of Wanglin Township, also cut five feet and seven inches of floral cloth, saying she wanted to dress her granddaughter beautifully for the Spring Festival. A female cooperative member who was with her asked her what else she wanted to buy for the New Year. She said, "I've bought all the New Year goods like sugar, dried bamboo shoots, and fresh fish." Shen Shiming, the director of the retail department, told me that a year ago, the predecessor of this retail department was the privately-owned Shen Chang Cotton Cloth Shop. At that time, business was very slow. Every year after the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month, the goods were inventoried, and the shop assistants went home for the Spring Festival. After the joint operation, everything changed. Today is already the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month, and it is still very busy. Since late January, sales have been five to six hundred yuan every day. I'm afraid it won't be idle even on New Year's Eve.

    The supply and marketing cooperative also has a complete range of general merchandise and knitwear, and farmers can generally buy their favorite daily industrial products. Qi Wenbiao, a member of the Xiangqian Sixteenth Cooperative of Yongchang Township, walked into the knitwear retail department and asked the salesperson to bring him a women's undershirt. While the salesperson was wrapping up the undershirt, she asked Qi Wenbiao about his family's income situation last year. From the conversation, I learned that this farmer, who had often relied on borrowing to make a living in previous years and regarded the Spring Festival as a "difficult hurdle," earned more than 700 workdays in the agricultural cooperative last year with three full laborers in his family, and received nearly 1,000 yuan. He added cotton clothes and quilts, and a few days ago, he had already bought sugar, dried bamboo shoots, fine vermicelli, and fresh fish, and also planned to steam several pecks of rice cakes for the Spring Festival. The general merchandise cooperative store was also crowded with customers from nearby rural areas. Farmers bought more than 20 kinds of goods in the general merchandise cooperative store that had been discontinued in the market for many years, such as Golden Rooster brand wool yarn, Double Coin brand short boots, and satin padded western-style children's hats.

    The employees of the butcher shops had their sleeves rolled up high and were working non-stop. On this day, all seven butcher shops in the town slaughtered more than a hundred pigs. Because the government stipulates that during the Spring Festival, everyone can buy a catty of pork with a cooking oil purchase certificate, there is no need to queue up to buy meat. I met Shen Xigeng, the accountant of the state-owned food company's purchasing and supply station in the town. He said that after the publicity and education of the worker-peasant alliance, the number of pigs sold by farmers has increased. In the twenty-five days of January, more than four hundred pigs have been purchased, more than double the number in December of last year. The market supply of local products, vegetables, and fresh fish is also increasing day by day. Housewives can still buy live fish in the evening.

    春节前的一个集镇
          新华社记者　周哲生
    最近，我搭轮船到苏州市外二十多里的吴县商业中心的黄埭镇去访问。在丰收年成的春节前夕，这个农村初级市场显得更加繁荣了。镇上的棉布商店里挤满着买布的农民。六步乡红星十四社女社员施阿巧，带着媳妇来到了公私合营震德第二门市部，一次就买了六丈多花贡呢、白细布、青色花旗布和一床七斤多重的棉花胎。王林乡十一社社员蔡巧金也剪了五尺七寸花布，她说她要把孙女儿打扮得漂漂亮亮的过春节。同行的女社员问她还要买什么年货？她说：“糖、笋干和鲜鱼等年货都办齐了。”门市部主任沈士明对我说，一年前，这个门市部的前身是私营慎昌棉布店。那时生意十分清淡，每年过了腊月24日就把货盘存起来，店员回家过春节。合营后，一切都变了，今天已是腊月25日，还忙得很，一月下旬以来每天要卖五六百元，恐怕到年三十夜也闲不下来。
    供销合作社的百货、针棉织品也很齐全，农民一般都可以买到自己喜爱的日用工业品。永昌乡向前十六社的社员戚文标走进针棉织品门市部，要营业员拿件女式卫生衫。营业员一面包扎卫生衫，一面向戚文标问起他家去年收入情况。从谈话中，我知道这个早几年经常靠借贷过活、把春节当“难关”的农民，去年全家三个整劳动力在农业社做了七百多个劳动日，分到近一千元，添置了棉衣、棉被，早两天已经买了糖、笋干、细粉和鲜鱼，还打算蒸几斗米的年糕过春节。在百货合作商店也同样拥挤着来自附近农村的顾客。农民在百货合作商店里买到了在市场上中断多年的金鸡牌绒线、双钱牌短靴和罗缎驼耳山西童帽等二十多种商品。
    肉铺子的职工袖子卷得高高的，忙个不停。这天全镇七家肉店共宰了一百多口猪，因为政府规定春节期间每个人凭购油证就可以买到一斤猪肉，买肉用不着排队了。我遇到镇上国营食品公司采购供应站的会计沈希庚，他说经过工农联盟的宣传教育后，农民出售生猪增加了。一月的二十五天中已经收购生猪四百多头，比去年十二月一个月增加两倍多。市场上的土产品、蔬菜、鲜鱼等上市量也日渐增多。家庭主妇们到晚上还能买到活鱼。
