Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, February 24th: Agricultural and fishery production cooperatives in the Jin County area of Lüda City are paying attention to helping and educating young men and women to establish correct relationships. Currently, in more than one hundred agricultural and fishery production cooperatives throughout the county, nearly nine hundred young couples have formed happy marriages based on mutual assistance and shared labor.

In the 15th production team of the Democratic Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chashan Township, Jin County, nine young couples who had developed feelings for each other during production faced obstruction from the women's parents. Lü Xianglin, the production team leader, persuaded the women's parents from various angles. Eventually, the elderly understood the principle that their children should obtain true happiness and agreed that these nine young couples could choose their own partners. Currently, many agricultural cooperatives also pay attention to organizing young men and women to participate in beneficial social activities such as amateur theatrical troupes, so that young men and women can have normal social interactions.

Before June of last year, rural cadres in this county did not pay enough attention to the marriages of young men and women and related education. Some girls handled their marriages rashly; some girls used "money" as the sole criterion for choosing a partner, which made it difficult for some rural young men to find partners and made them unwilling to work in rural areas. After June of last year, the Party and Youth League organizations in this county began to care about the marriages of rural youth. Party organizations in sixteen townships convened forums for young men and women to understand their thoughts, help them, and educate them to establish correct relationships. The Jin County Committee of the Youth League also introduced the experience of the Democratic Agricultural Cooperative in Chashan Township in caring about the marriages of young people to various agricultural cooperatives.

    金县的农业社
    关心青年婚事
    新华社旅大24日电　旅大市金县地区的农、渔业生产合作社注意帮助和教育青年男女建立正确的恋爱关系。目前，全县一百多个农、渔业生产合作社中，有将近九百对青年男女在共同劳动、互相帮助的基础上结成了美满的婚姻。
    金县岔山乡民主农业生产合作社第十五生产队，曾有九对在生产中建立了爱情的青年男女受到女方家长的阻挠。这个队的生产队长吕相林从多方面劝说女方的家长，最后老人们明白了应该使子女获得真正幸福的道理，同意这九对青年男女自己挑选的对象。目前，许多农业社还注意组织青年男女参加业余剧团等有益的社会活动，使青年男女能有正常的社交关系。
    去年6月以前，这个县的农村干部对青年男女的婚事和有关这方面的教育不够重视。有些姑娘轻率处理婚事；有的姑娘把“金钱”做为挑选爱人的唯一标准，以致有些农村小伙子的婚事不好解决，不安心在农村工作。去年6月以后，这个县的党团组织开始关怀农村青年的婚事。有十六个乡的党组织召集青年男女座谈，向他们了解思想情况，帮助和教育他们建立正确的恋爱关系。青年团金县委员会还向各农业社介绍了岔山乡民主农业社关心青年婚事的经验。
