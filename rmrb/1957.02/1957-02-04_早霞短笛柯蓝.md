Early morning glow is right above us. These are the colors we paint on the sky with our brushes...

    An Old Man
    In the morning, I came out of the mountains and saw an old man, with white hair, standing by the river. He was sharpening his long axe on a stone. He is the oldest lumberjack in this mountain forest.
    In the evening, I returned to the mountains and saw the same oldest lumberjack, standing by the river, holding a bamboo pole. Carrying a fish basket, he jumped onto a small boat. He became the oldest fisherman on this river again...
    If the trees he has felled over the decades were tied together into rafts, they could cover the entire river surface.
    If the fish and shrimp he has caught over the decades were piled up, they could form a mountain... But the old man's small house only has a few wooden pillars. There are no fish or shrimp in his rice bowl either. This man who has created so much wealth enjoys so little himself... It seems he has dedicated even himself to this lovely world. (August 10)

          Withered Tree
    In autumn, I walked to the end of the forest and saw a small river. On the other side of the river grew a thin, tall mulberry tree. The river separated this mulberry tree from the forest.
    As soon as the mulberry tree saw me, it shook its branches and shouted:
    "Let me come over quickly, I don't want to stand here alone! I want to go back to the forest! It's so cold over here!..."
    In winter, I went to the end of the forest again and saw this solitary mulberry tree again. The mulberry tree could not withstand the wind and snow, and it had withered and died. The strong wind had broken its branches...
    Trees that are far away easily wither and die. A heart that is far away from the people will also wither and die.
                    (September 3, at Muling)
      Sounds I Love to Hear
    Living in a small village in the countryside, I love to hear the rooster crow at dawn. That melodious sound leads us to the future. It wakes everyone up and calls them to the fields.
    Living in a small town in the suburbs, I love to hear the whistle of the train at dawn. That long sound also leads us to the future. It gathers everyone and sends them to the workshops.
              (18th, on a journey at Sanhe Village)
            Consolation
        -- Dedicated to an Old Comrade
    You wrote to me telling me that your hair has started to fall out, and your temples are already gray... My heart was immediately filled with passion.
    If someone wants to count the hairs you've lost (from your comb...), I would say: the hairs you've lost are mostly for others, how many are for yourself?
    If someone asks what has turned your temples gray? I would say: what turned your hair gray is not personal sorrow, but concern for others and the anxiety caused for others...
    Hair falling out and temples graying are, for you, the most touching signs of hard work.
    What falls out will be reborn, and what turns white will shine brightly...
              (9th, excerpt from a short letter)
          Passion
    We have such passion, it is like a glass of full-bodied wine. In life, we hold it high above our heads. We use it to feast our parents, our fellow villagers, and our friends.
    Whoever has this passion will burn when it encounters a spark, and it will dance even without the wind...
    Whoever has this passion can make strangers acquainted, and acquaintances become close. It enables those with wishes to have their wishes fulfilled...
            (November 19, on the Beijing-Shanghai express train)
      Notify Nature
    I declare: Life belongs to the people, and the people will conquer everything.
    In the high sky, we can talk to the drifting clouds and play with the blizzards. Even if we don't have wings, we can look at the forests from the sky like birds, and the forests become smaller. The rivers also become smaller. The whole of nature has lost its secrets to us...
    I want to repeat a hundred times: We people will occupy everything. We can freely travel underground and build tall houses. Even if we don't have scales, we can sing and dance in the water like schools of fish, recreating a sun and a moon in the world of water.
    I now formally notify the sky, the ocean, the mountains, and everything else: Humans will always be the true masters. The laughter of humans will fill the earth, and even the boundless places beyond the earth...
      (November 14, written at a scientific planning conference)
            Who?
    Who divides time into day and night? And who cuts off the long river of life? Letting the night separate life, wanting to make life have a temporary pause?
    It seems this is wishful thinking.
    You hid the sun, we hung up the moon! You raised the night curtain, we released the stars! You arranged a night for us to sleep, but our machines do not rest even at night...
    Who told us to use years, months, and days to calculate time? And who thought so cleverly to use numbers to calculate the speed of time?...
    It seems that this kind of calculation is also somewhat ineffective now.
    A thought that we fly up, a piece of wisdom that suddenly jumps up, they chase the day and night, chasing the sun, moon, and stars. Making it impossible for you to calculate this speed, to calculate this change!
    This is the voice of our era, the change of this era.
    We will live forever in the early morning glow of dawn... (5th, written in Binhai)

    早霞短笛	柯蓝
    早霞就在我们的头上。这是我们用画笔在天空涂上的色彩……
    一个老人
    早上，我从山林里出来，看见一个老人，带着一头白发，站在江边。他在一块石头上磨他的长斧。他是这个山林里最老的伐木人。
    晚上，我回到山林里去，却看见这个最老的伐木人，站在江边，拿着一根竹杆。提着一只鱼篓，跳上了一条小船。他又成了这个河上最老的渔人……
    如果把他几十年砍的树木，结成木排，可以盖满江面。
    如果把他几十年捕捉的鱼虾，堆聚起来可以成山……但是这个老人的小屋里，只有几根木柱。他的饭碗里也没有鱼虾。这个创造了许多财富的人，他自己却享受很少……看来，他连他自己都献给这个可爱的世界了。　（8月10日）
          枯树
    秋天，我走到树林的尽头，看见一条小河。小河的对岸长着一株瘦高的桑树。小河把这株桑树和树林分开了。
    桑树一看见我，就摇着树枝喊：
    “快让我过来，我不要一个人站在这里！我要回到树林子里去！我这边多冷呵！……”×××
    冬天，我又到了树林的尽头，又看见了这株孤独的桑树。桑树经不起风雪，它已经枯死了。大风把它的树枝吹折了……
    远离的树木容易枯死。远离人群的心也会枯死。
                    （9月3日于牡岭）
      爱听的声音
    住在乡下的小村里，我爱听黎明的鸡叫。那悠扬的声音，把我们引向未来。把所有的人都叫醒了。叫到田野里去了。
    住在城郊的小镇上，我爱听黎明的汽笛。那悠长的声音，也把我们引向未来。把所有的人都集合去了，集合到车间里去了。
              （18日于三合店旅途）
            劝慰
        ——献给一个老同志
    你写信告诉我，你的头发开始脱落，两鬓已经花白……我的心马上充满了激情。
    如果有人要数点你脱落的头发（从你的木梳上……），我要说：你那脱落的头发，更多的是为了别人，又有几根是为了自己？
    如果有人来查问又是什么染白了你的鬓发？我要说：染白你头发的，不是个人的忧愁，而是对别人的关心和为别人而引起的焦虑……
    头发脱落了，两鬓花白了，对你来说，这是最动人的辛勤的标志。　　
    脱落的也会新生，发白的将白得发亮……
              （9日摘自一封短信）
          激情
    我们有这样的激情，它像一杯斟满的醇酒。在生活里把它高举过头。用它来宴请我们的父母、我们的乡亲和我们的朋友。
    谁有这种激情，遇到火星就要燃烧，没有风吹，它也跳动……
    谁有这种激情，能使陌生的人相识，相识的人相亲。使有愿望的人，愿望实现……
            （11月19日于京沪快车）
      通知大自然
    我宣告：生活属于人，人要征服一切。
    在高空我们可以和流云说话，跟大风雪玩耍。即使我们没有翅膀，也能够和飞鸟一样，从高空来看森林，森林变小了。河流也变小了。整个大自然对我们都失去了秘密………
    我要重复一百遍：我们人要占领一切。我们可以在地下自由来往，修造高大的房屋。即使我们没有鳞甲，也能够和鱼群一样，在水里唱歌跳舞，在水的世界再造出一个太阳和一个月亮。
    我现在正式通知天空、海洋、山岳和所有的一切：人永远是真正的主人。人的笑声将充满地球，以至地球以外无边无际的所在……
      （11月14日写于一个科学规划的会议上）
            谁？
    是谁把时间分成白日、黑夜？又是谁把生活的长河切断？让黑夜来把生活分开，想使生活也有暂时的停顿？
    看来，这是妄想。
    你藏起了太阳，我们挂起了月亮！你升起了夜幕，我们放出了星星！你安排一个黑夜给我们睡眠，我们的机器却夜晚也不休息……
    是谁告诉我们用年、月、日来计算时间？又是谁想得这样巧妙，用数字来计算时间的速度？……
    看来，现在这种计算也有点失效。
    我们飞起的一个想望，突然跳起的一个智慧，它们追赶着白日黑夜，追赶着日月星辰。使你没有办法来计算这个速度，计算这个变化！
    这是我们这个时代的声音，这个时代的变化。
    我们将永远生活在黎明的早霞里……　（5日写于滨海）
