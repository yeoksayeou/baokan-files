    We Visited Fraternal Countries
    Long Yun
    I was very honored to participate in this visit abroad by the delegation of the National People's Congress.
    I am over seventy years old and have high blood pressure. The doctor told me to rest more. Especially in the cold winter, it should be difficult to make a long-distance trip in several countries with ice and snow. But I finally refused the doctor's advice and unexpectedly went abroad for the first time. This shows how excited and eager I was.
    The delegation of the National People's Congress, headed by Comrade Peng Zhen, left Beijing on the morning of November 15, 1956, aboard the latest Soviet jet airliner, the "Tu-104." This was my first time on a jet plane. There were more than fifty seats and three rooms in the cabin. The outside temperature was as low as minus fifty-four degrees, but the temperature and pressure inside the plane were normal. We could rest, play chess, and have breakfast on it.
    After leaving the motherland, we first arrived in Irkutsk, Soviet Union. After getting off the plane for a rest, we were warmly welcomed by the leading comrades of the local Soviet and many people. Later, we continued to fly via Omsk and arrived in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, that afternoon. Welcoming us at the airport were the chairmen of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet and other responsible comrades.
    In the Soviet Union, we visited Moscow, Leningrad, and the capital of the Uzbek Republic, attended banquets and forums, carried out various activities, and visited factories, farms, schools, hospitals, scenic spots, historical sites, and historical relics in various places.
    The urban construction of Moscow and Leningrad is well planned, and many workers' residential areas are currently being built. We also saw the Kremlin and the Winter Palace in Leningrad. I lingered and forgot to leave because of their magnificent and splendid architecture.
    During this visit, we learned that the Soviet Union possessed atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missiles several years ago, which showed the strength of the Soviet Union's national defense. It is truly a powerful pillar for defending world peace and the socialist camp. At a banquet, Marshal Zhukov and I were chatting together when Bulganin walked over and said, "You military people are always closer." Another senior leading comrade said: "We must unite as one, maintain world peace, and seek welfare for mankind." At that time, Marshal Zhukov jokingly replied to that comrade while saying to me: "If there is world peace, the two of us may lose our jobs." Everyone laughed. Chairman Voroshilov said solemnly: "Although we want peace, we must not relax our preparations against aggressors."
    After we finished our visit to the Soviet Union, we went to Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria for visits one after another. In all three countries, we attended their parliamentary meetings, visited various construction projects, and toured several famous cities.
    The people of these three countries have a very high standard of living. Especially in Czechoslovakia, there is no difference between urban and rural life. The people across the country can enjoy public medical care, and the people on the streets wear neat and beautiful clothes. What is particularly outstanding is that the highways throughout the country, even the rural trunk roads, are asphalt roads. The social order of these three countries is also very good, and the people's lives are very stable. In these three countries, wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed by the government, the Party, and the people. They were so hospitable, especially to the Chinese, and were very interested in China's socialist construction. However, they also had some misunderstandings about our country, such as the following two points: (1) The advanced agricultural cooperativization developed very quickly. In a country with such a large agricultural population, it has reached more than 80% of farmers taking the road of advanced cooperativization in a short period of time. Because they were liberated earlier than us, their agricultural cooperativization was slower and did not reach this level. (2) The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, capitalists actively requested joint state-private ownership, and they were happy when the government approved it, and felt depressed if it was approved late. They didn't understand these two points very well and seemed to have doubts. Another point is that in our delegation, the members were of different backgrounds; but whether it was in large or small meetings and personal contacts, their views on things were consistent, and they also thought it was a bit strange. They all praised and said: "This delegation has consistent thinking and is disciplined."
    In addition to the developed industry and excellent products in Czechoslovakia, the scenery of this country is very beautiful. I had the opportunity to rest for a few days at the world-famous resort of Karlovy Vary, the Charles Spring. The hotel we stayed in was called "Soviet Palace." Before liberation, it was called "Imperial House." The scenery there is incredibly beautiful and unforgettable.
    This time we visited four countries for just two months. I saw that the leaders of these countries are very strong, united with the people, and are supported by the people; production and construction are constantly developing, and people's lives are improving year by year. For example, Czechoslovakia announced a price reduction the day before we went. Romania is also increasing purchase prices, increasing farmers' income, and reducing farmers' burdens, and people's lives are very stable.
    Although the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the "National Assemblies" of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria have different names and organizational forms, we attended these parliaments and saw that they fully implemented the tasks of the people's regime and showed a high degree of democratic spirit everywhere, which also explains the superiority of the socialist regime organs.
    The countries we went to, whether government or people, were very friendly and respectful to our country, and showed such sincerity. What is the reason for this? That is because the organizational composition of our delegation is the Communist Party and various democratic parties, including representatives from industry, agriculture, commerce, science, education, literature, art, news, and women's circles. In their analysis, the relationship is comprehensive and the weight is very heavy. It can be said that it brought the friendship of 600 million people. At the same time, the friendship between us and the fraternal countries is built on the basis of the same ideology, the same goals, and the same interests. This is the greatest guarantee of our unity and friendship. Therefore, I believe that this visit of our delegation has achieved the purpose of the visit—strengthening mutual understanding between the fraternal countries and enhancing the friendly unity between the peoples, which is also the sacred mission entrusted to us by the people of the whole country.
    During this visit, I had profound feelings and impressions. I am honored for the improvement of the international status of the motherland and feel warm for the warm welcome of the fraternal countries. I believe that the socialist system is superior, because I have personally seen the living conditions of the people in the Soviet Union and the other three fraternal countries, which vividly proves this point. I am even more convinced that the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming more and more consolidated. This united force is eternal, not temporary, and is invincible.
    I think our visit was successful.

### 我们访问了兄弟国家

    我们访问了兄弟国家
    龙云
    这次我们全国人民代表大会代表团出国访问，我得以参加，非常荣幸。
    我是七十多岁的人，血压较高，医生嘱咐多加休养。特别在严寒的冬天，要在几个冰天雪地的国家里作较久的远程旅行，这应该是感到困难的。但我终于拒绝医生的劝阻，竟然首途出国。这说明了我是多么兴奋，多么热望。
    以彭真同志为首的全国人民代表大会的代表团，在1956年11月15日上午，搭乘苏联的最新型的喷气式客机“图—一○四”式离开北京。我坐喷气式客机这还是第一次。机舱里有五十多个座位，三个房间。室外冷到零下五十四度，但飞机里的温度和气压却很正常。我们在上面可以休息、下棋，而且进早餐。
    离开了祖国，首先到达苏联的伊尔库次克。下机休息就受到当地市苏维埃的领导同志和很多群众的热烈欢迎。以后又继续飞经鄂木斯克，当天下午到达了苏联首都莫斯科。在机场欢迎的是最高苏维埃的两院主席及其他负责同志。
    在苏联我们访问了莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌兹别克共和国的首都，参加了宴会和座谈会，进行了各种活动，参观各地的工厂、农庄、学校、医院、名胜古迹和历史文物。
    莫斯科和列宁格勒的城市建设很有规划，现在正在建筑很多工人住宅区。我们还看了克里姆林宫和列宁格勒的冬宫，我为它们宏伟壮丽的建筑而留连忘返。
    在这次访问中，我们了解到苏联在前几年就拥有原子弹、氢弹、导弹，这显示了苏联国防力量的强大，她真是保卫世界和平与社会主义阵营的强大支柱。在一次宴会中，朱可夫元帅和我在一起交谈，布尔加宁就走了过来说：“你们军人在一起，总是比较亲热的。”又有一位高级领导同志说：“我们大家要团结一致，维护世界和平，为人类谋福利。”当时朱可夫元帅开玩笑地一面回答那位同志的话，一面对我说：“如果世界和平，我们两人可就要失业了。”大家都哄笑起来。伏罗希洛夫主席严肃地说：“我们虽然要和平，但对侵略者，我们的准备是不可松懈的。”
    我们在苏联结束了访问以后，就先后赴捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚三个兄弟国家进行访问。在三个国家都列席了他们的议会会议，参观了各种建设，游览了若干著名城市。
    这三个国家的人民，生活水平甚高。特别是捷克斯洛伐克，城乡之间的生活已经看不出什么距离，全国人民都能享受公费医疗，街上的人穿的衣服都是很整洁漂亮的。尤其突出的是他们全国的公路，即便是乡村干道都是柏油路。这三个国家的社会秩序也非常良好，人民生活十分安定。我们在这三个国家中，所到之处，都受到政府、党和人民的热烈欢迎。他们那样爱客，特别是爱中国人，对中国社会主义建设感到很大的兴趣。但他们对我国也有不大理解的问题，如像以下两点：（一）农业高级合作化发展得很快，以农业人口如此多的国家，而时间不久，竟已达到80％以上的农户走上高级合作化的道路。因为他们解放的时间比我们久，他们的农业合作化反而慢，没有达到这个程度。（二）资本主义工商业的改造，资本家主动要求公私合营，政府批准了就表示高兴，如果批迟了就感觉情绪沮丧。这两点他们不甚理解，似有怀疑。另外还有一点，在我们访问团中，成份不同；但无论大会小会和个人接触，对事情的看法都是一致的，他们也认为有点奇怪。都称赞说：“这个代表团思想是一致的、有纪律的。”
    捷克斯洛伐克除了工业发达、产品优良外，这个国家的风景是十分美丽的。我有机会到卡罗维发利城世界著名的休养地查理温泉休息几天。我们住的旅馆称为“苏维埃宫”。解放前叫“帝国之家”。那里风景优美无比，令人难忘。
    这一次我们访问了四个国家，为时刚刚两个月。我看到这几个国家的领导很坚强，和人民团结一致，是得到人民拥护的；生产建设正不断发展，人民生活逐年都有提高。如像捷克斯洛伐克在我们去的前一天还公布降低物价。在罗马尼亚也在提高收购价格，增加农民收入，降低农民负担，人民的生活很安定。
    苏联的最高苏维埃和捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚三个国家的“国民议会”，虽然名称和组织形式各有不同，但我们列席了这些议会，看到了他们都充分地执行了人民政权的任务，处处表示了高度民主的精神，这也就说明了社会主义政权机关的优越性。
    我们所到的国家，无论政府或人民，对我们的国家都非常友爱和尊敬，而且表现得那样真诚恳挚。这是什么原因呢？那就是我们这个代表团的组织成份是共产党和各民主党派，包括有工、农、商、科学、教育、文艺、新闻、妇女各界代表。在他们分析起来，关系全面，份量很重。可以说是带去了六亿人民的友情。同时，我们同兄弟国家之间的友爱，是建筑在思想相同、目标相同和利害相同的基础上的。这就是我们团结友好的最大保证了。所以，我认为我们这一次代表团的访问，是达到了访问目的的——加强了各兄弟国家之间的相互了解，增进了人民彼此之间的友好团结，这也就是完成了全国人民委托给我们的神圣使命。
    我在这一次访问当中，有着深刻的感受和印象，我为祖国国际地位的提高而感到光荣，为兄弟国家热烈的欢迎而感到温暖。我相信社会主义制度是优越的，因为我眼见的苏联和其他三个兄弟国家的人民生活情况，生动地证明了这一点。更相信以苏联为首的和平民主阵营日愈巩固。这个团结力量是永恒的，不是暂时的，是不可战胜的。
    我认为我们这次访问是成功的。
