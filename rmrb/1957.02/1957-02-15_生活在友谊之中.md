At Moscow University, everywhere are dear comrades, and everywhere there are good teachers and helpful friends. Sacred friendship warms us at all times.

When we first arrived at Moscow University, we encountered language difficulties in our studies. Because we had only studied Russian for a few months in China, we couldn't understand anything in the first few classes. The school leaders understood this situation and immediately tried to help us quickly improve our Russian, opening special small classes and adding practical classes. Teacher Momunov, who specialized in helping us with modern Russian, was a modern Russian teacher with broad knowledge. To ensure that we thoroughly understood the content of the lectures, he always explained the text in a concise and clear manner, and then illustrated it with examples one by one. If we didn't understand it once, he would explain it again; if we still didn't understand, he would explain it again. In the beginning, although he spoke very slowly, we still couldn't take notes, so he would read each word and sentence two or three times, even the commas and periods, and kept asking: "Did you write it down? If you didn't, I'll repeat it." He wouldn't feel relieved until everyone said they had written it all down, and sometimes he would personally check our notes and correct mistakes. He usually had many lectures and a busy schedule, and his health was not very good, but he was never a minute late for our classes.

Vasilevsky is a professor of a more complex theoretical course for us. When we told him that we couldn't understand the large classes, but before we made a request, he immediately said: "Okay! I am willing to give small classes to you Chinese children." Thus, he added two hours to his almost full teaching schedule specifically for us. In one class, he brought a middle-aged Soviet woman. Why? We didn't know. Later, this unknown Soviet woman said in fluent Chinese: "The content of this lesson is very important, and the professor is afraid that you will not understand it easily, so he asked me to be a temporary translator."

Every teacher who lectures to us at Moscow University helps us with such meticulousness. Teacher Zhu Baowa had to rush from the suburbs early in the morning to give us extra small classes. Simonova is a young female teacher who just graduated from Moscow University. She teaches us language. In class, she patiently corrects every incorrect pronunciation. If we made mistakes in our homework, she would correct them neatly with a red pen. If we made a mistake the first time, she would correct it. If we made the same mistake again, she would ask us to correct it repeatedly in the place where we made the mistake. She said: "You don't actually understand it, otherwise why would you make the mistake again?" Her seriousness and patience were sometimes hard to believe, considering she was only a young person in her twenties!

Olya, this is a small Ukrainian girl. She is younger than all of us, but she cares about our studies like an elder sister. She often uses very simple Russian that can perfectly express the professor's meaning to explain problems to us. She is so enthusiastic and patient, and doesn't seem to mind spending a lot of time. Before the Marxist-Leninist classroom discussions, she carefully helped us revise our speaking outlines. In class, she encouraged us: "Raise your hand! Don't be afraid!" After class, she warmly greeted us and shook hands: "Congratulations. Do you know? We all understood your speech." The support of friendship gave us warmth and strength, and encouraged us to study and move forward more diligently. We asked her: "Is it because the Communist Youth League entrusted you that you help us?" "No." "Then why do you help us?" She widened her eyes in surprise and shrugged her shoulders and said: "What's so special about that? Can you not help when you see others in difficulty? Besides, we are close friends!"

"Soviet students and Chinese students are close friends." This sentence is firmly imprinted in our hearts. When Chinese students are not feeling well, Soviet students always take care of them meticulously. Last year, student Tang Xiuzhe caught a cold, and his roommate Valoga personally arranged for a doctor and made him hot water. He said: "You are Mao Zedong's son, and you should be healthy so that you can study better."

Soviet students are very concerned about the victories of various undertakings in New China, and they are very eager to understand New China. Many classes and grades have held symposiums on New China, introducing the achievements of New China in industry, agriculture, culture, art, and other aspects. They laughed happily and heartily when they heard us introduce the life of college students in New China. Especially when we said: "After you graduate, please come to our capital, Beijing!" Before we finished speaking, warm applause rang out.

The Soviet friends' love for China from the bottom of their hearts has given us such unforgettable impressions in many occasions: they are our relatives. Once, we were warmly invited to attend a Soviet student's wedding. The Chinese gifts we sent were placed in the most conspicuous place. The wedding was proceeding. When the guests raised their glasses to congratulate the new couple on their eternal happiness, the groom's mother stood up, filled everyone's glasses with wine, raised her glass, and looked at us intently and said: "I invite everyone to drink to the happiness of the Chinese people!"

Olya returned to her hometown during the winter vacation. When she talked to her relatives and friends about studying with Chinese students at school, the Ukrainian youths congratulated her enviously: "You are so happy! We can only learn about China from news about China published in newspapers, from Chinese novels translated into Russian and Ukrainian, and from Chinese movies; but you can study and live with Chinese friends, that's great!"

Living in Moscow University is like living in a sea of friendship. We cherish this sacred friendship as we cherish the most precious things in the world. If we can make some contributions to the construction of a socialist and communist motherland in the future, it is precisely the result of the selfless help and sincere friendship given to us by Soviet friends today.

    生活在友谊之中
    莫斯科大学中国留学生  傅显明　唐修哲  范信龙　刘水才
    在莫斯科大学到处都是亲爱的同志，到处都有良师益友。神圣的友谊随时都温暖着我们。
    我们初到莫斯科大学时，在学习上首先碰到的是语言上的困难。因为我们在国内只学了几个月的俄文，所以开始的几堂课什么也听不懂。学校的领导上了解了这种情况，马上设法帮助我们迅速提高俄文水平，专门开小课，增设实习课。专门帮助我们上现代俄语课的莫蒙诺夫老师，是一位具有广博知识的现代俄语教师。为了使我们彻底懂得授课内容，他总是概要而清楚地讲解课文，然后一一举例来说明。一次不懂，再讲一遍，再不懂，再讲。开始，他虽然讲得很慢，但我们笔记还是记不下来，于是他就逐字逐句地念上两三次，连逗点、句号他都要念出来，并且不住地问：“记下来了吗？没记下，我再重复一遍。”一直到大家说全记下来了他还不放心，有时亲自查看我们的记录，纠正错误。他平时授课就多，工作忙，身体健康又不太好，但他给我们上课从不迟到一分钟。
    华西列夫斯基是我们一门较为复杂的理论课的教授。当我们告诉他上大课听不懂，但还没有提出要求时，他接着就说：“好吧！我愿意跟你们中国孩子们上小课。”于是，在他几乎排得已满满的授课表上，又增添了两小时，专给我们授课。一次课上，他带来了一位中年的苏联妇女。为什么？我们都不知道。后来，这位不认识的苏联妇女用一口流利的中国话说：“这一课内容很重要，教授怕你们不易懂得，要我来当临时翻译。”
    莫斯科大学每一个给我们授课的老师，都是这样一丝不苟的帮助我们。朱宝娃老师为了给我们增上小课，她必须老早从城郊赶来。西苗诺娃是一位刚从莫斯科大学毕业的青年女教师。她教我们语言课。课上，她耐心地纠正每一个不正确的发音，我们的作业有了错误，她就用红笔端正地改正过来，第一次错，她改了。第二次重错时，她就指定在重错的地方，要我们重改，重做几遍。她说：“实际上你没有懂啊，不然为什么又错了呢？”她的严正、耐心，有时真叫人难于相信，她才是一个二十多岁的青年人哩！
    奥莉娅，这是一位小个子的乌克兰姑娘。她比我们都要年轻，然而却像大姊一样地关怀着我们的学习。她常常用非常浅显而又能完善地表达教授的意思的俄语给我们解释问题。她是那样地热情和耐心，完全不觉得已经耗费了不少时间。在马克思列宁主义的课堂讨论之前，她仔细地帮助我们修改发言提纲。上课时，她支持我们：“举手吧！别怕！”一下课，她热情地迎上来握手：“祝贺你。你知道吗？你的发言我们都听懂了。”友谊的支持，给了我们温暖和力量，鼓励我们更努力地学习和前进。我们问她：“是因为共青团委托了你，你才帮助我们的吗？”“不是。”“那么你为什么帮助我们呢？”她惊奇地睁大了眼，耸了耸肩说：“那有什么呢？难道当看到别人有困难时，能够不帮助吗？何况我们是亲密的朋友呢！”
    “苏联同学和中国同学是亲密的朋友。”这句话已牢固地印在我们的心里。中国同学身体不舒服，苏联同学总是无微不至地照顾。一年留学生唐修哲感冒了，他的室长瓦洛加亲自张罗请医生，冲开水。他说：“你是毛泽东的儿子，身体应该健健康康地，才能更好地学习。”
    苏联同学们非常关心新中国的各项事业上的胜利，非常渴望着了解新中国。很多班、级都举行过关于新中国的座谈会，介绍新中国的工业、农业、文化、艺术等各方面的成就。他们听到我们介绍新中国大学生的生活时，都愉快又爽朗地笑了起来。特别是我们说到：“你们毕业后，请到我们的首都北京来玩！”话还没完，热烈的掌声就响了起来。
    苏联朋友出自心田的对中国的热爱，在很多场合都给我们这样的不能忘怀的印象：他们是我们的亲人。有一次，我们被热忱地邀请参加一位苏联同学的婚礼。送去的中国的礼物被布置在最令人注目的地方。婚礼进行着。在客人们举杯祝贺新夫妇永远幸福时，新郎的母亲站了起来，她为大家酌满了酒，举起了杯，疑视着我们说：“我请大家为中国人民的幸福而干杯！”
    奥莉娅在寒假中回到了家乡。她向亲人和朋友谈起在学校中和中国同学一起学习时，乌克兰的青年们羡慕地向她祝贺：“你太幸福了！我们要了解中国，只能从报上登的关于中国的消息中，从译成俄文和乌克兰文的中国小说中，从中国电影上来了解；可是，你却能和中国朋友一起学习，一起生活，那太好了！”
    生活在莫斯科大学宛如生活于友谊之海。我们珍惜着这神圣的友谊像珍惜世界上最宝贵的东西一样。如果我们在建设社会主义、共产主义祖国的岗位上，将来能有所贡献的话，那这正是今天苏联友人们给我们的无私帮助和真挚友情的结果。（附图片）
