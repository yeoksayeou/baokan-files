Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 22nd: With only two days left until the start of voting in India's second general election, the election campaigns of various political parties in India have entered their most heated stage. The ruling Congress Party is concentrating its efforts on launching its election campaign.

The Congress Party has already secured twelve seats in the People's Assembly and forty seats in the state assemblies without facing any competition, as opposition party candidates withdrew their names.

However, the Congress Party has encountered strong opposition in West Bengal from a united front of five left-wing parties, including the Communist Party and the Praja Socialist Party. In Kerala, the Communist Party is one of the most powerful parties. The Congress Party has sent Patil, considered a senior campaign expert, to Kerala to conduct the Congress Party's campaign. In Bombay, the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti, the Maha Gujarat Janata Parishad, and the united front of various parties are all contesting all the seats against the Congress Party. In Orissa, the Congress Party is facing fierce competition from the right-wing Ganatantra Parishad, composed of former princely rulers. In Bihar, Madras, and Uttar Pradesh, many Congress Party members are contesting against the official candidates of the Congress Party as independents.

As the election campaign unfolds, more and more attention is being paid to those constituencies where the competition is fierce. In North Bombay, Praja Socialist Party leader Alvares is competing against Menon of the Congress Party. In another Bombay constituency, mainly composed of working-class voters, Ambekar, the leader of the Indian National Trade Union Congress led by the Congress Party, is competing against Dange, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party and General Secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress. In Calcutta, Communist leader Ismail (a Muslim) is competing against Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal. In this constituency, most people are workers and Muslims.

    印度大选迫近投票日期
    各党派竞选活动进入最高潮
    据新华社新德里22日电　距离印度第二届大选开始投票的日期只有两天了，印度各政党的竞选活动已经进入最热烈的阶段，执政的国大党正集中力量展开竞选运动。
    国大党已在没有遭到竞争的情况下，获得十二个人民院席位和四十个各邦议会的席位，因为反对党派候选人撤销了自己的名字。
    但是，国大党在西孟加拉邦遭到了包括共产党和人民社会党在内的五个左翼党派联合阵线的强烈的反对。在喀拉拉邦，共产党是最强有力的党派之一。国大党已经派了被认为是高级竞选专家的帕蒂尔去喀拉拉邦进行国大党的竞选运动。在孟买，统一马哈拉拖特拉委员会、大古吉拉特人民协会和各党派的统一战线都在同国大党竞选所有的席位。在奥里萨，国大党面临着由前土邦王公组成的右翼民主大会党的激烈的竞选。在比哈尔、马德拉斯和北方邦，许多国大党人在以无党无派人士的身份同国大党的正式候选人竞选。
    随着竞选运动的展开，人们愈来愈注意那些竞选激烈的选区。在孟买北部，人民社会党领袖阿尔瓦雷斯在同国大党的梅农竞选。在孟买另一个主要是由工人阶级选民组成的选区，国大党领导的印度全国工会大会的领袖安贝卡在同共产党政治局委员、全印工会大会总书记丹吉竞选。在加尔各答，共产党领袖伊斯梅尔（一位穆斯林）在同西孟加拉邦首席部长罗伊竞选。在这个选区，大多数人都是工人和穆斯林。
