Xinhua News Agency report:

Qingdao Municipality: More than sixty handicraft production cooperatives in Qingdao are mutually utilizing waste materials for production, turning a large amount of waste into valuable raw materials.

The Qingdao Basic Chemical Fertilizer and Soap Production Cooperative is using sawdust from the carpentry production cooperative to successfully trial-produce a type of mixed fertilizer. It officially began production in January of this year, with a monthly output of approximately ten tons. This cooperative is also using waste materials such as pigskin scraps from the boot and shoe production cooperative to produce 45 tons of organic nitrogen fertilizer, which is very popular among agricultural production cooperatives.

The fourteen sewing production cooperatives throughout the city used to sell tens of thousands of jin of cloth scraps and corners trimmed each month to peddlers. Starting in the first quarter of last year, these materials have also been utilized by brother cooperatives. The larger triangular cloth pieces are used by the cloth wheel production cooperative to replace cotton cloth in the production of cloth wheels for electroplating lights. From January of last year to January of this year, they have saved the state more than 290,000 chi of cotton cloth. The remaining small pieces of cloth and scraps are all fluffed into cotton by the cotton production cooperative and supplied to the rope production cooperative to spin into various colored cords, which are then supplied to the net bag production cooperative. From January of last year to the end of January of this year, the net bag production cooperative has used these cords to weave more than 250,000 net bags, 74,000 umbrella covers, and more than 4,000 handbags, schoolbags, and small wallets.

The boot and shoe production cooperative generates more than 1,800 jin of rubber residue each month from the polishing of rubber soles. In the past, this was always treated as waste. Now, the rubber products production cooperative uses it to manufacture various specifications of children's stroller tires and bicycle pedals. The wire mesh production cooperative has a large amount of wire ends left over from the weaving of wire mesh. The thicker ones are used by the mirror production cooperative to make mirror back frames, and the rest are prepared to be supplied to the ironware production cooperative for making fishhooks, enabling the fishhook production, which had been suspended in November last year due to a shortage of raw materials, to resume production.

The Qingdao Municipal Handicraft Bureau has made unified arrangements for the mutual utilization of waste materials between cooperatives, fixing the suppliers and users.

    青岛手工业社互相利用废料
    据新华社讯　青岛市有六十多个手工业生产合作社正在互相利用废料进行生产，使很多废料变成了好原料。
    青岛市基本化学肥皂生产合作社利用木器生产合作社的锯末，试制成功一种杂肥，今年1月份正式生产，每月可以生产十吨左右。这个社还利用靴鞋生产合作社剪下的猪皮子头等废料，生产了深受农业生产合作社欢迎的有机氮素肥料四十五吨。
    全市的十四个缝纫生产合作社每月剪裁下来的上万斤布边、布角，过去都卖给收破烂的小贩，去年第一季度开始也被兄弟社利用起来。其中较大一点的三角布头，被布轮生产合作社用来代替人民布，生产电镀灯光用的布轮，从去年1月到今年1月的十三个月中，已经为国家节约了二十九万多尺人民布。剩下的细碎的布头、布边，又全部被制棉生产合作社弹成花，供给纺绳生产合作社纺成各种颜色的线绳，然后供给网兜生产合作社。去年1月到今年1月底止，网兜生产合作社利用这种线绳编织成二十五万多个网兜、七万四千多个伞套以及四千多个手提包、书包、小钱包。
    靴鞋生产合作社做磨光胶底剩下的胶末，每月有一千八百多斤，过去一向是当做废物，现在也被橡胶制品生产合作社用来制造各种规格的儿童藤车轮胎和自行车脚踏。铁丝网生产合作社编铁丝网剩下大批铁丝头，一部分较粗的被镜子生产合作社利用做镜子底架，其余的准备供给铁业生产合作社做鱼钩用，使在去年11月因原料缺乏而停产的鱼钩得以恢复生产。
    青岛市手工业管理局曾对社与社之间的废料相互利用作了统一安排，使供应户和利用户固定下来。
