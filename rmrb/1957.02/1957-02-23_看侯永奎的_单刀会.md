    Watching Hou Yongkui's "Single Blade Meeting"
    Tang Shi
    Mr. Hou Yongkui's "Single Blade Meeting" is an outstanding Kunqu Opera program. In this play, Mr. Hou very accurately shapes the image of Guan Yu, a hero with a broad mind nearing his twilight years. According to opera critiques, this can be considered a near-divine performance.
    During Yang Xiaolou's later years, Mr. Hou Yongkui's "Night Flight" was already very famous. Yang Xiaolou considered "Night Flight" his most cherished masterpiece. With such a master of martial arts on hand, Mr. Hou was still able to excel at "Night Flight," being referred to alongside Yang Xiaolou as "contemporaries of equal talent," which made the aging master feel the younger generation was formidable. This shows the depth of Mr. Hou's skill. I have seen Mr. Hou's "Night Flight" no fewer than three or five times over the years, and I feel it gets better each time. In the most recent performance, I felt it could be called a "unique skill." It is truly "returning to simplicity after extravagant polish," without any impetuosity or showing off of technique, but fully expressing the temperament of a hero of intellect. But I don't think his "Single Blade Meeting" is weaker than "Night Flight." In this play, he disdains to perform some of the general dances of martial roles, the beard-blowing, eye-glaring actions in general Guan Gong plays, and some pretentious knife-dancing postures. Instead, he focuses on expressing the character's upright spirit and the spirit of being strong in old age, and he performs with completeness of spirit and full vitality. Every gesture is radiant and powerful. This is precisely winning by spirit, which is in line with the characteristics of "transmitting the spirit" in our traditional art. Mr. Hou only has one or two still poses of Guan Yu standing with his knife, which are very concise and very agile, momentarily solidifying the leaping momentum into a peaceful posture. I think that's enough. You have to know that Guan Yu is already grizzled at this time. With Zhou Cang by his side wielding the Green Dragon Crescent Blade for him, it can also set off his heroic bearing. He really doesn't need to move his weapons lightly. If there were more, if it were more "fiery," it wouldn't be like Guan Yu nearing his twilight years. This is by no means cutting corners. On the contrary, Mr. Hou does not relax for a moment during the performance, and there is not a single slack part in his whole body. His image of Guan Yu is full of energy. Sometimes with a flick of his long beard, his two fingers point forward, as if there is a weight of a thousand pounds on the fingertips. In general Peking Opera, Guan Yu seems to never have shed his impetuosity in his life, but in Guan Hanqing's play, although he does not accept old age, he is a mature hero. I think Mr. Hou Yongkui's performance grasps the nuances of this aspect very well. When he comes on stage, standing, saying "Waves roll eastward across the river," and singing "The great river flows east, the waves are stacked thousands of times..." we can appreciate the vastness of the misty and boundless, white-waved river scene and the heroic spirit that can accommodate this vast river from his eyes. Guan Yu's eyes are not usually wide open, but when they do open at this time, they appear extraordinarily radiant. When Lu Su says "Famous generals must have treasured swords," and Guan Yu wants to sacrifice to the sword with wine, Zhou Cang directly dances the sword in front of Lu Su, but Guan Yu remains calm, even when saying to the sword, "Sword scares sword, thinking of you taking the heads of enemy generals from a million troops as easily as taking something out of a bag, today I am invited by Doctor Lu to a banquet, if there is injustice at the table, you must be troubled to work," his demeanor is as stable as Mount Tai, but that power is truly like Mount Tai pressing down on Lu Su's head, causing him to change color abruptly. When Guan Yu recounts to Lu Su the events of his resigning from Cao Cao and returning to the Han, passing five passes and traveling alone for thousands of miles, Mr. Hou Yongkui's few dance postures are also very refined, condensing the strength of his whole body, while also showing the characteristic of restraint.
    Mr. Hou Yongkui's singing also has this characteristic of restraint. His singing voice is still as high and bright as it was in his youth, but even more deep and powerful. He does not win with winding and circuitous tunes. On the contrary, his singing style is straightforward and simple, but he sings "full" and sings "complete." I think playing Guan Yu should be sung this way. Guan Yu is not like Lin Chong. Lin Chong is still in his prime, a "lost" hero. Although he is enduring humiliation and bearing shame, he cannot help but sometimes vent the anger in his chest. Guan Yu is much more mature. Although he is a hero whose ambition has not diminished, the breadth of his mind cannot be compared with Lin Chong's, because he is a famous general who "defends Jingxiang with a single horse and single blade," who has seen the characters of "the Yangtze River has passed through several battlefields, and it is just like the back waves pushing the front waves." Mr. Hou Yongkui's singing is deep and vigorous, which just shows the grand atmosphere of this character, proving that he can rely on a single blade to explore this "thousand-foot tiger and wolf den" and be sure of victory.

### 看侯永奎的“单刀会”

    看侯永奎的“单刀会”
    唐湜
    侯永奎先生的“单刀会”，是一个出色的昆曲节目。在这出戏里，侯先生非常准确地塑造出了胸襟浩大、时近暮年的英雄人物——关羽的形象，按曲品的说法，这可算是近于神品的演出了。
    在杨小楼晚年时，侯永奎先生的“夜奔”就已经名重一时了。杨小楼是以“夜奔”为他平生最得意的杰作的，有这么一位武生的宗师在，侯先生居然能以“夜奔”见长，和杨小楼一起被人称为“一时瑜亮”，使晚年的宗师感到后生可畏，就可见侯先生功夫之深了。侯先生的“夜奔”，几年来，我看过不下三、五次，觉得一次比一次好。在最近的一次演出中，我觉得它已称得起是“绝活”了。那真是“豪华洗尽见真淳”，毫无火气，毫不卖弄技巧，却充分地把一个有智量的英雄的气概表现了出来。但我觉得他的“单刀会”也不弱于“夜奔”。在这个戏里，他不屑于表演一些武生的一般舞蹈，一般关公戏中的吹胡子、瞪眼睛的动作和一些装模作样的舞刀姿势，只着重表现这个人物的磊落气概和老当益壮的精神，而且表演得神完气足，一举手一投足无不神采奕奕，美而且有力。这正是以神胜，正符合我国传统艺术的传神的特点。侯先生在这个戏里只有一两个关羽横刀却立的舞姿，非常凝炼，非常矫捷，把跃动的气势一霎时凝定于宁静的姿态，我觉得这就已经够了。要知道，关羽这时已是须眉苍然了，有周仓在旁为他舞起青龙偃月刀，也就可以衬托出他的英武了，自己实在可以不必轻动刀枪。如果再多一些，再“火”一点，那倒不像近于暮年的关羽了。这决不倒偷工减料，恰恰相反，侯永奎在演出中没有一刻松气，全身也没有一处懈怠，他的关羽的形象是饱孕着精力的。有时一掀长髯，两个手指向前一指，指尖上就仿佛有千钧之力。在一般京剧里，关羽这个人似乎一生未脱火气，但在关汉卿的这个戏里，他虽不服老，却是一个成熟的英雄。我觉得，侯永奎先生的表演在这方面分寸掌握得很好。他出场时一站，一说“波涛滚滚渡江东”，一唱“大江东去浪千叠……”我们就可以从他的眼神里领略到烟波浩渺、白浪山叠的江景和能容纳这一片大江的豪杰胸怀。关羽的眼睛平常不大张开，这时一张开，也就显得异样光采，当鲁肃说“名将必有宝刀”，关羽要以酒祭刀时，周仓直把刀舞到鲁肃面前，关羽却不动声色，甚至连对刀说“刀吓刀，想你在百万军中取上将首级，如探囊取物，今日蒙鲁大夫请某饮宴，倘席上有不平之处，须要劳你一劳”时，神态稳如泰山，但那威势却真如泰山压顶般直压到鲁肃头上来，使他勃然变色。当关羽对鲁肃叙说当年辞曹归汉，五关斩将，千里独行之事时，侯永奎的不多的一些舞姿也非常洗练，凝结着全身的力量，同时又显出了节制的特点。
    侯永奎先生的唱也有这种节制的特点的。他现在的歌音仍和少年时一样高亢嘹亮，但更沉雄有力了。他不以迂回曲折的腔调取胜，反之，他的唱腔是平直浑朴的，但他唱得“饱”，唱得“满”，我觉得演关羽是应该这样唱的。关羽不比林冲，林冲还在壮年，是个“失路”的英雄，虽在忍辱含耻，但不免有时还要吐吐胸中之气；关羽却成熟多了，他虽然是一个壮心未已的英雄，胸怀的壮阔却非林冲可比，因为他是个“匹马单刀镇荆襄”的名将，眼见过“长江今经几战场，恰便是（似）后浪催前浪”的人物。侯永奎先生的唱的沉雄苍劲，正好显出了这个人物的气象阔大，证明他能单凭一刀来探这“千丈虎狼穴”，确是有必胜的把握的。
