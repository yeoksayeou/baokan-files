Humbly Learn from Advanced Experience of Brother Factories
            By Our Reporter Liu Shiping
    A few days ago, I visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant.
    As soon as I sat down in the Party General Branch office of the Iron Smelting Department, a person came in and handed a carbon copy of a report to Comrade Guo Hua, the deputy secretary of the General Branch, who was sitting across from me. Comrade Guo Hua looked at the report with a happy smile on his face. I was infected by Comrade Guo Hua's excitement, so I picked up the report and looked it over, but I couldn't understand it. Comrade Guo Hua realized that I was an outsider, so he stood up and walked over to me, pointed to the numbers on the report, and told me, "This is the first shot of the New Year, and the pig iron production in the first week has exceeded the original target."
    From his explanation, I learned that in the first month of this year, they originally planned to increase production by 900 tons of pig iron. However, according to the statistics up to January 8, they had already produced more than 600 tons of pig iron more than the original work plan target. At the same time, they also saved the country 124 kilograms of coke per ton of iron smelted.
    When introducing this achievement, Comrade Guo Hua compared it with the past, saying, "In the era of Japanese occupation, only 60 tons of iron were produced here a day; now, the pig iron we produce above the target every day is greater than that number!"
    Since the liberation of Beijing, this factory has developed rapidly. However, by 1955, some of the factory's indicators were not advanced enough among the national iron and steel plants. Last year, the factory's production underwent significant changes. In the inter-factory competition among the national iron and steel plants, the factory won the championship for three consecutive quarters. By the end of last year, they had reached the 1957 production level, completing the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. At the beginning of this year, all the factory's employees, with creative labor, fired the first shot on the production front. The main products, such as pig iron, coke, and cast pipes, all exceeded the original work plan. It is truly an inspiring thing.
    How was this achievement achieved?
    When answering this question, Comrade Guo Hua quoted the words of Comrade An Chaojun, an engineer at the factory, at the recent Beijing Municipal People's Congress meeting: "Experience over the years has proved that if we want to increase production, we must promote advanced experience and adopt new technologies."
    At the beginning of last year, the Party organization of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant put forward the slogan "Catch up with the domestic advanced level and march towards the international level." In order to ensure the realization of this slogan, the administrative side formulated a plan for the whole year's work; the trade union organized employees to carry out friendly competitions with factories and mines of the same type across the country. The overall goal of the whole year's work put forward: the total goal of struggle in 1956 is to focus on the development of new technologies. The main method is to learn and promote advanced experience.
    To learn and promote advanced experience, the first obstacle encountered was ideological: complacency and conservatism. At that time, in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, from leaders to employees, there was a certain degree of complacency. They only saw the changes in their own factory in recent years and mistakenly believed that they were already almost there. Comrade Guo Hua said: "At that time, many comrades' attitude towards the advanced experience of brother factories was: when learning from large factories, they emphasized objective difficulties; when learning from small factories, they looked down on them a little." For example, regarding the advanced experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, some people always emphasized that Anshan Iron and Steel Company had more experts, better ore, mechanized equipment, strong technical force, and national support, so they did not humbly learn from them. As for small factories, they looked down on them and did not believe that they were advanced. When they first heard that the coke powder rate of the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant was only 3%, they didn't believe it.
    With this kind of thinking, it was of course difficult to learn from the advanced experience of other factories. So, what should be done?
    "Facts speak louder than words. Organizing practical observation and comparison is a practical and effective method to overcome complacency," said Comrade Guo Hua. At that time, the Party organization of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant first organized the leading personnel, technical personnel, and worker representatives of the coking and iron smelting departments to go to the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant and Anshan Iron and Steel Company for observation and learning.
    Dong Jilai is the chairman of the trade union in the coking workshop. He also went to the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant with the branch secretary and foreman of the workshop with the idea of doubting the advancement of others. What was the ideological situation in the workshop before they left? Comrade Dong Jilai frankly told me: "At that time, from the leaders to the employees, they all expressed doubts about the advanced indicators of the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, believing that the coke powder rate could not reach 3%; if it was really that low, the calculation might not be accurate. Because the furnaces in the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant are not very good, and the coal used is also washed in the coal washing machine of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, how can the coke powder rate be so much lower than ours?"
    At that time, the coke powder rate of coking at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was about 5%, which was about 2% higher than that of the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant. After they arrived there, they looked at a furnace that was being coked and found that the coke powder rate of the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant was not only as low as 3%, but had already been reduced to 2.58%, and the consumption of raw coal per ton of coke was reduced by 40 to 50 kilograms.
    After they returned to the factory, they used facts to educate the employees in the workshop and criticized the complacency of the past, which believed that "it is advanced enough, and it will be difficult to reduce it further." After several months of efforts, by November of last year, the coke powder rate of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant had been reduced from about 5% at the beginning of the year to 2.31%. During the same period, the coke powder rate of the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant was also reduced to 2.2%. It is said that there are some differences in the calculation of the coke powder rate between the two factories, so there is still a small difference. From the perspective of specific production, it can be said that the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has caught up with the national advanced level in this regard.
    Last year, the factory sent a total of 96 batches of production and technical personnel to 59 factories and mines for study. Through practical observation, they recognized the shortcomings in the factory's production, criticized the idea that it was already almost the same, and thus humbly learned and promoted many advanced experiences from other factories. For example, the Iron Smelting Department seized the weak link of blast furnace No. 1, promoted Anshan Iron and Steel's experience in rapid combustion of hot blast furnaces, shortened the ventilation time, and increased the blast temperature of the hot blast furnace. The blast temperature of the first hot blast furnace once created a record of 1,000 degrees Celsius. Due to the active promotion of the advanced experience of brother factories, the reasonable suggestions of the factory's employees also came one after another. The Iron Smelting Department had improved the angle of the motor fan of the hot blast furnace based on the workers' suggestions. Due to these improvements, the factory produced more than 50,000 tons of pig iron more than in 1955, and at the same time saved more than 23,000 tons of coke, thereby making the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reach the advanced indicator - the volume of one ton of iron smelted per 24 hours is 0.7 cubic meters. In this regard, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has also caught up with the domestic advanced level.
    "Modesty helps one to advance, pride makes one lag behind." The comrades of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have a particularly deep understanding of this golden rule. Since observing and studying at Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has sent people to various brother factories and mines in large numbers and in complete sets to study; when people come to their factory to visit, they also ask the visitors to leave their opinions. In the third quarter of last year, they and Anshan Iron and Steel Company exchanged delegations composed of party committee secretaries, factory directors, trade union chairmen, technical personnel, foremen, etc., systematically exchanged advanced experience with each other, and signed a contact contract to exchange technical monthly reports in order to learn from each other's strengths and improve together.
    They also spread their own experience to others without reservation. I read a letter from Cao Furong, a technician from Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, to Pan Chunshan, a technician from the Iron Smelting Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. The letter said: "After returning to the factory, our blast temperature was only 620 degrees Celsius, and it could not always meet the needs of smelting furnaces... I told everyone all the experience that my master told me. We shortened the ventilation time, and the blast temperature increased from 620 degrees to 810 degrees. On the existing basis, we plan to strive to increase it to 850 degrees."
    Now, learning from the advanced experience of brother factories and mines, and exchanging experience with other factories, has become a common practice in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. As long as they hear that there is good experience there, they take the initiative to go there to study. They are preparing to frequently organize production with advanced indicators on the basis of having already caught up with the domestic advanced level in the main technical and economic indicators such as iron smelting and coking, and strive to create greater production achievements.

### 虚心学习兄弟厂的先进经验

    虚心学习兄弟厂的先进经验
            本报记者　刘时平
    前几天，我访问了石景山钢铁厂。
    当我刚在炼铁部党总支办公室里坐下来的时候，一个人走进来，把一份复写的表报递给坐在我对面的总支副书记郭华同志。郭华同志看着那份报告，脸上流露出愉快的笑容。我被郭华同志的兴奋心情感染着，顺手接过来那份表报，翻来复去看了一遍，但是看不懂。郭华同志发觉我是一个外行，就站起来走到我的身边，指着报表上的数字，告诉我：“这是新年的第一炮，第一周的生铁产量就比原订指标增产了。”
    从他的解释中，我知道：他们在今年的第一个月，原来计划增产九百吨生铁。可是，到1月8日止的统计，他们已经比原订的作业计划指标多生产了六百多吨生铁。同时，每炼一吨铁还为国家节约了一百二十四公斤焦炭。
    郭华同志在介绍这个成绩的时候，同过去对比了一下，他说：“过去，在日寇统治的时代，这里一天只出六十吨铁；现在，咱们每天超产的生铁，也比这个数字大！”
    自从北京解放以后，这个厂有了迅速的发展。但是，到1955年，这个厂有些指标在全国钢铁厂中还不够先进。去年，这个厂的生产有了较大的变化。在全国钢铁厂的厂际竞赛中，这个厂一连三个季度获得优胜。到去年年底，他们已经达到1957年的生产水平，提前一年完成了第一个五年计划。今年一开始，全厂职工又以创造性的劳动，在生产战线上打响了头一炮。主要产品，如生铁、焦炭、铸管等，都超额完成了原订的作业计划。真是一件鼓舞人心的事情。
    这种成绩是怎样得来的呢？
    郭华同志回答这个问题的时候，引证了这个厂的工程师安朝俊同志在最近举行的北京市人民代表大会会议上说的话：“几年来的经验证明，要想增加生产，必须推广先进经验，采用新技术。”
    去年年初，石景山钢铁厂的党组织提出了“赶上国内先进水平，向国际水平进军”的口号。行政方面为了保证这个口号的实现，制订了全年工作的规划；工会组织职工同全国同工种的厂矿开展了友谊竞赛。全年工作规划中提出：1956年奋斗的总目标，以发展新技术为重点。主要的办法是学习和推广先进经验。
    要学习和推广先进经验，首先碰到了个思想障碍，这就是保守自满情绪。那时候，在石景山钢铁厂，从领导到职工都存在着一定程度的自满思想，他们只看到本厂几年来的变化，就误认为自己已经差不多了。郭华同志说：“当时，许多同志对兄弟厂先进经验的态度是：学大厂，强调客观困难；学小厂，还有点看不起人家。”例如对鞍山钢铁公司的先进经验，有人总是强调鞍钢的专家多，矿石好，设备机械化，技术力量雄厚，又有全国的支援，因而不虚心向人家学习。对于小厂，又看不起人家，不相信人家先进。他们刚听说石家庄焦厂的焦末率只有3％的时候，就都不相信。
    有着这种思想，当然很难学习外厂的先进经验。那末，怎么办呢？
    “事实胜于雄辩。组织实际观察和比较，是克服自满思想的切实有效的方法。”郭华同志说。当时，石景山钢铁厂的党组织首先组织炼焦和炼铁部的领导人员、技术人员和工人代表到石家庄焦厂和鞍钢去进行了观察和学习。
    董吉来是炼焦车间的工会主席。他也是带着怀疑别人先进的思想，同车间分支书记、工长等一起到石家庄焦厂去的。他们出发以前，车间里的思想情况是怎样呢？董吉来同志坦率地告诉我：“当时由领导到职工，都对石家庄焦厂的先进指标表示怀疑，认为焦末率不可能达到3％；如果真的那样低，可能是计算方面不准确。因为石家庄焦厂的炉子并不算好，用的煤料也是在石景山钢铁厂的洗煤机里洗出来的，焦末率怎么能比我们低这样多呢？”
    当时，石景山钢铁厂炼焦的焦末率是5％左右，比石家庄焦厂的焦末率高2％左右。他们到那里以后，看了一个正在出焦的炉子，才发现石家庄焦厂的焦末率不仅低到3％，而且已经降低到2.58％，炼一吨焦炭少耗用净煤四十到五十公斤。
    他们回厂以后，用事实教育了车间的职工，批判了过去认为“已经够先进的了，再降低就困难了”的自满思想。经过几个月的努力，到去年11月，石景山钢铁厂的焦末率已经从年初的5％左右，降低到2.31％。同一时期，石家庄焦厂的焦末率也降低到2.2％。据说，在焦末率计算方面，两个厂有所不同，因此还有一点差额。从具体生产情况看来，可以说，石景山钢铁厂已经在这方面赶上全国的先进水平了。
    去年一年，这个厂共派出生产技术人员九十六批，到五十九个厂矿进行了学习。通过实际观察，认识了本厂生产中的缺点，批判了认为已经差不多的思想，因而虚心学习和推广了外厂的不少先进经验。例如，炼铁部抓住一高炉的薄弱环节，推行了鞍钢的热风炉快速燃烧经验，缩短了通风时间，提高了热风炉的风温，第一热风炉的风温曾经创造过摄氏一千度的最高纪录。由于积极推广兄弟厂的先进经验，本厂职工群众的合理化建议也纷至沓来。炼铁部就曾根据工人的建议，改进了热风炉的马达风扇角度。由于这些改进，去年这个厂比1955年增产了五万多吨生铁，同时节约焦炭二万三千多吨，从而使高炉的利用系数达到先进指标——每二十四小时炼一吨铁的容积是零点七立方公尺。在这方面，石景山钢铁厂也赶上了国内的先进水平。
    “虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”这句金石良言，石景山钢铁厂的同志们体会得特别深切。自从到鞍钢和石家庄焦厂观察和学习过以后，石景山钢铁厂就大批地、成套地派人到各个兄弟厂矿去学习；有人到他们厂来参观，他们也请参观的人留下意见。去年第三季度，他们和鞍钢互派了以党委书记、厂长、工会主席、技术人员、工长等组成的代表团，系统地相互交流了先进经验，并且订了联系合同，互通技术月报，以便取长补短，共同提高。
      他们自己的经验，也毫无保留地传播给别人。我看了重庆钢铁公司技术人员曹富荣给石景山钢铁厂炼铁部技师潘春山的一封信。信中说：“回厂以后，我们的风温只有摄氏六百二十度，总是供不上炼炉的需要……我就把师傅告诉我的经验，全部告诉了大家。我们就缩短了通风时间，风温从六百二十度提高到八百一十度。在现有的基础上，我们准备争取提高到八百五十度。”
      现在，学习兄弟厂矿的先进经验，同外厂互相交流经验，在石景山钢铁厂已经形成一种风气。只要听说那里有好经验，他们就主动到那里去学习。他们正准备在炼铁、炼焦等项主要技术经济指标已经赶上国内先进水平的基础上，经常以先进指标组织生产，争取创造更大的生产成绩。
