Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd – According to TASS, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin said at a reception in honor of Finnish Republic Prime Minister Fagerholm: "Your visit to the Soviet Union proves that the friendship and cooperation between our two countries is developing and consolidating. Soviet-Finnish relations are an example of the implementation of the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems."

Bulganin held the reception in Moscow on the 2nd. He said that Soviet-Finnish relations and cooperation are developing on the basis of the principle of peaceful coexistence and in accordance with the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance signed in 1948. Finland's peace-loving and neutral foreign policy promotes the cause of peace and promotes friendly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union, as well as between Finland and other countries. This policy also safeguards Finland's independence and security.

Fagerholm also spoke at the reception. He said that during the visit, it was often mentioned that the good neighborly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union are becoming more friendly and consolidated year by year. The gratifying development of this relationship should be attributed to the foresight and wisdom of the great statesmen of both countries. It should also be pointed out that the reason why it is possible to achieve this goal today, which was still distant a few years ago, is that everyone in Finland and the Soviet Union has realized the great significance of this friendly relationship. This relationship is in the national interests of both Finland and the Soviet Union. The Finnish people highly value the good relations with their great neighbor, the Soviet Union. This fact is a more reliable guarantee for the consolidation and development of this good neighborly relationship than solemn documents.

The atmosphere of the reception was warm and friendly. Soviet Party and government leaders Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Khrushchev, and others, as well as Finnish Minister of Commerce and Industry Klimala, also attended the reception.

After the meeting, a grand artistic performance was held for the guests.

    布尔加宁设宴招待芬兰总理
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在招待芬兰共和国总理法格霍姆的招待会上说：你的访问苏联，证明了我们两国间的友谊和合作正在发展和巩固。苏芬关系是贯彻社会制度不同的国家和平共处原则的范例。
    布尔加宁是2日在莫斯科举行这个招待会的。他说，苏芬两国关系和合作是在和平共处原则的基础上、根据1948年签订的友好合作互助条约发展的。芬兰的爱好和平的、中立的外交政策促进了和平事业，促进了芬兰同苏联以及芬兰同其他国家的友好关系。这种政策也保障了芬兰的独立和安全。
    法格霍姆在招待会上也发表了讲话。他说，在访问期间，人们时常提到，芬兰和苏联之间的睦邻关系一年比一年更加友好和巩固。这种关系得到令人愉快的发展，应当感谢两国大政治家的远见和英明。同时也应当指出，今天之所以能够达到这个在若干年以前还是遥远的目的，是因为芬兰和苏联的每一个人都意识到了这种友好关系的重大意义。这种关系符合芬苏两国的民族利益。芬兰人民对于和伟大邻国苏联的良好关系估价极高。这个事实比庄严的文件更可靠地保证了这种睦邻关系的巩固和发展。
    招待会的气氛热烈友好。苏联党和政府领导人米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、赫鲁晓夫等以及芬兰工商部长克利莫拉也出席了招待会。
    会后，还为客人举行了盛大艺术表演。
