    Spring at the Home of a Centenarian
    Outside the city of Suzhou, in Changchuan Bay, Madam Ye Liu, who was born in the first year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, joyfully celebrated her 106th Spring Festival.

    On the first day of the Spring Festival, people from left and right came to wish the old woman a Happy New Year, bringing New Year cakes, buns, sweets and other festive foods. The old woman happily said, "High promotion! High promotion!" ("High promotion" is the auspicious word the old woman uses to thank people.) Children also noisily surrounded the old woman, shaking hands and saying hello. The old woman blessed the children with "longevity to one hundred years" and told them stories about the ancient Peng Zu, who lived to be eight hundred years old, from folk legends. That day, the neighbors also sent meat dishes and japonica rice to the old woman from their own homes. Madam Ye Liu said that she has lived for more than a hundred years, and the number of people who have come to wish her a Happy New Year is the most this year, and the most lively.

    A few days ago, the neighbors took time out of their busy schedules to help this lonely old woman arrange her holiday life. Liu Cuilan, the deputy head of the residents' group, washed her shirts clean, cleaned her residence, and bought oil, salt, firewood, rice, fresh fish, and vegetables with the relief money distributed by the government. Some government organs, organizations and other units in and outside the city also sent people to express their condolences and give food and money to the old woman.

    Madam Ye Liu was a boatwoman in her youth and lived on rivers and lakes for many years. When she was in her sixties, her husband and eldest son were burned alive by bandits, and her other three sons and four daughters also died one after another. At the age of eighty, the old woman was alone in Changchuan Bay outside Suzhou City, begging along the streets, sometimes eating her fill, sometimes going hungry, and enduring nearly twenty years of hardship. At that time, the people living in Changchuan Bay were all laborers who earned their living by carrying and pulling carts. Everyone sympathized with the old woman's plight, but they were unable to help her.

    Not long after liberation, Madam Ye Liu stopped begging for food. She had three meals a day without worry, and she wore cotton clothes and cotton shoes and covered herself with a thick cotton quilt every winter. The People's Government has long been providing relief to this old woman. The staff of the Jinzhang District People's Committee also cared very much about the old woman's life. Not long ago, cadres from the District Civil Affairs Section saw that the cotton quilt and cotton clothes that the old woman was wearing, which had been issued by the government two years ago, were a bit cold, so they gave her another cotton quilt and a set of cotton clothes. In early August of last year, a strong typhoon damaged the old woman's house, and the government built a new house for her to live in.

    When the old woman first lived a life of not begging or wanting, she was surprised and quietly asked others: Which great philanthropist was showing compassion by supporting her in her old age? The residents told her that it was the People's Government that was ensuring her food and clothing. She praised repeatedly: "Good government! Good government!"

    The lives of the working people in Changchuan Bay have generally improved after liberation, and people care for Madam Ye Liu as if they were caring for their own elders. Some send food, some send clothes, and some help the old woman with housework. Xu Ding, who is in her seventies, sends cotton shoes and socks for the old woman to wear.搬运工人薛小根逢年过节总要盛些荤菜给老人。搬运工人薛小根逢年过节总要盛些荤菜给老人。搬运工人薛小根逢年过节总要盛些荤菜给老人。搬运工人薛小根逢年过节总要盛些荤菜给老人。搬运工人薛小根逢年过节总要盛些荤菜给老人。搬运工人薛小根逢年过节总要盛些荤菜给老人。The mover Xue Xiaogen always serves some meat dishes to the old woman during the New Year and holidays. Boys in their teens compete to fetch water for the old woman. The girls compete to wash rice and vegetables. Liu Cuilan, the deputy head of the residents' group with five children, helps others wash clothes all day long and manages household chores, but she visits the old woman once or twice a day. In this cold weather, Liu Cuilan washes her jacket and trousers every ten days or so. Liu Cuilan, Qi Meiying and others receive the living relief funds issued by the government to the old woman every month, and they help the old woman plan their use. When the old woman talks to people about how she can still survive, she always gratefully says: "Thanks to the government! Thanks to the neighbors!"

    Now, this old woman, who has lived for more than a century, is still in good spirits and cooks her own three meals a day. She can eat a big bowl of dry rice or porridge every meal, and she often chats with people nearby. If it weren't for the neighbors' insistence on helping, she would still have to go to the river to wash rice and vegetables herself. Now the neighbors don't hear her complain about her hard life and wishing to die early. On the contrary, she avoids mentioning the word "death," and she hopes to live a few more years.

    春在百岁老人之家	新华社记者周哲生　王庆华
    姑苏城外长船湾的一个出身在太平天国元年的叶刘氏，欢欢喜喜地度过了第一百零六个春节。
    春节一大早，左邻右舍的人都跑来向这位老人拜年，并带来年糕、包子、糖果等节日食品。老人高兴得连声说：“高升！高升！”（“高升”是老人用来感谢人的吉利话）孩子们也闹哄哄地围在这位老人身边，拉手问好。老人祝福孩子们“长命百岁”，又给孩子们讲了关于民间传说的古代彭祖寿高八百的故事。这天，邻居们还把自己家里的荤菜和粳米饭送给老人。叶刘氏说：她活了一百多岁，向她拜年的人要算今年最多，最热闹。
    几天前，邻居们就在百忙中抽空帮助这个孤寡老人安排好节日生活。居民副组长刘翠兰替她把衬衣洗得干干净净，打扫了住处，用政府发放的救济金买了油、盐、柴、米、鲜鱼和蔬菜等。市内外有些机关、团体等单位还专门派人来慰问，赠送食品和钱给老人。
    叶刘氏年青时是个船家妇女，长年生活在江河湖泊上。六十多岁时，她的丈夫和大儿子被土匪活活烧死，其余的三男四女也都先后死去。八十岁那年，老人孤零零地一个人流落在苏州城外长船湾，沿街求乞，饱一顿，饥一顿，衣不暖身地熬过了将近二十年岁月。那时，住在长船湾的都是靠搬运、拉车等苦力营生的劳动人民，大家都怜悯老人的境遇，但无力给她以帮助。
    解放后不久，叶刘氏不再讨饭了，她日食三餐不愁，每年冬季穿上棉衣和棉鞋，盖上厚棉被。人民政府长期救济这位老人。金阊区人民委员会的工作人员也都非常关心这个老人的生活。不久以前，区民政科的干部看到老人盖的政府前年发给的棉被和穿的棉衣有些冷，便又救济她一床棉被和一身棉衣。去年8月初，强台风刮坏了老人的住屋，政府砌了一间新屋给她住。
    老人起初过着不讨不要的生活时，感到惊奇，悄悄问别人：是哪个大善人发慈悲心养她老的？居民告诉她说，是人民政府保她吃、穿。她赞不绝口地说：“好政府！好政府！”
    长船湾的劳动人民生活在解放后普遍改善了，人们关怀叶刘氏就像关怀自己长辈一样。有的送吃食，有的送衣服，有的帮老人做家务事。七十多岁的徐丁氏送棉鞋、袜子给老人穿。搬运工人薛小根逢年过节总要盛些荤菜给老人。十多岁的男孩子争着给老人挑水。女孩子们争着淘米、洗菜。五个儿女的居民副组长刘翠兰，自己成天帮人家洗衣服，又要管理家务，但她每天要看老人家一两次，像这样寒天，刘翠兰每隔十来天就代她洗一次褂裤。政府发给老人的生活救济费，每月都是刘翠兰、戚美英等人去领取，她们帮助老人计划使用。老人和人们谈起她现在还能活下去的时候，总是感激地说：“多亏政府！多亏邻居！”
    现在，这个活了一个多世纪的老人精神依然很好，每天三顿饭都是自己动手做的。每顿能吃一大碗干饭或者稀饭，她还经常到附近人家闲谈。要不是邻居们强行帮忙，她还要自己去河边淘米洗菜。现在邻居们都听不到她说命苦和盼早死的怨言了，相反的提到“死”字她就避讳，她希望多活几年。
