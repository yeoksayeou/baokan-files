    USSR Academy of Sciences Holds Annual Meeting
    Soviet Physics Research Achieved Great Success Last Year
    Academician Landau Proposes Composite Inversion Theory Explaining that Parity Conservation Law is Not Universal
    Preliminary Experiments Confirm that Hydrogen Can be Transformed into Helium Without Reaching Temperatures of Several Million Degrees
    Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: According to a TASS report on February 23rd: Academician Topchiev, Academic Secretary of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences, told participants at the annual meeting of the USSR Academy of Sciences that 1956 was a year of great success in the development of Soviet physics—the main branch of modern natural science. During this year, the Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of the Academy studied more than forty problems.
    Academician Topchiev pointed out that in the new research in nuclear physics, Academician Landau's work is of great significance, as it is an important step in developing theoretical concepts regarding the nature and characteristics of elementary particles. The radio astronomy theory of the origin of cosmic rays proposed by Corresponding Member of the Academy Ginzburg and Professor Shklovsky is of great significance. Corresponding Member of the Academy Veksler led some scientists to propose new ideas on methods for accelerating elementary particles, and they have begun the work of starting up the world's largest accelerator with one hundred billion electron volts. Larger accelerators of 50 to 60 billion electron volts are now being designed.
    The annual meeting of the USSR Academy of Sciences was held in Moscow on February 22nd and 23rd. At the meeting, scientists discussed the results of the scientific activities of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1956 and planned the prospects for carrying out further research.
    In his report to the annual meeting summarizing the scientific activities of the USSR Academy of Sciences last year, Topchiev also spoke about the research results in geology, astronomy, mechanics, automation equipment, radio technology, biology, and social sciences. He pointed out that the General Astronomical Observatory is conducting experiments on using television technology in astronomy. Television equipment is used as a brightness enhancer for celestial bodies that can be clearly seen with the naked eye. Using this method, the brightness of the image of the moon's surface on the television screen is approximately three hundred times brighter than the image on a telescope.
    Academician Topchiev also focused on the issue of developing science in the eastern Soviet Union, in areas of rapid national economic development. He read a proposal from two academicians regarding the establishment of a huge scientific center of the Academy of Sciences in Siberia. This proposal was warmly endorsed by all participants.
    The annual meeting approved the summary report of the scientific activities of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1956.
    People also listened to a lecture entitled "Chemical Kinetics and Chain Reactions" by Nobel Prize winner and Academician Semyonov.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: The Soviet "Pravda" published a report on the 15th stating that the institute led by Academician Kurchatov of the USSR Academy of Sciences has recently made important achievements in studying the possibility of constructing controllable thermonuclear reactions.
    Not long ago, preliminary experiments confirmed the concept of Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences Zeldovich: hydrogen can be transformed into heavier elements—helium—at ordinary temperatures, without requiring temperatures of millions of degrees. The decisive factor in this is the μ meson, an elementary particle with a mass approximately two hundred times that of an electron orbiting the nucleus.
    Among the new discoveries in nuclear physics is the so-called composite inversion theory proposed by Soviet physicist Academician Landau in 1956. Landau explained the essence of the new theory to a reporter from the Soviet Pravda:
    Nuclear physics is developing based on laws that indicate the properties of time and space. Of particular importance in physics are the so-called conservation laws based on the symmetry of space and time: the law of conservation of energy and the law of conservation of momentum.
    None of us would doubt that the space we see in a mirror is generally no different. At the same time, everyone knows that in the mirror, left becomes right and right becomes left. The conservation law known as the parity conservation law in atomic physics is related to this situation.
    Until recently, there was no doubt about the correctness of this law. It was not until the so-called κ meson was discovered not long ago that doubts arose. The κ meson is an elementary particle with a mass approximately nine hundred and sixty times that of an electron. The lifespan of this particle is very short. It has now been determined that this particle can split into two π mesons or three π mesons.
    According to analysis, it can be considered that the κ meson that splits into two π mesons should have the opposite parity to the κ meson that splits into three π mesons. However, experimental materials have increasingly reliably proven that the two types of κ mesons are completely identical.
    From this, only one conclusion can be drawn: Unlike most other laws in physics, the parity conservation law is not universal. This law is undoubtedly obeyed in various general interactions of elementary particles, but it may sometimes be violated.
    At first glance, this conclusion has an unexpected nature for modern physics, because it is difficult to imagine reasons for abandoning the spatial mirror symmetry. But in my opinion, an explanation for this situation has recently been found.
    The essence of my view is that mirror symmetry can only occur if all particles are replaced by antiparticles in mirror reflection.
    Only empty space—vacuum—is completely mirror-symmetric. The lack of symmetry is precisely the nature of elementary particles. To use the language of physicists, the image of a person in a mirror differs from the person not only in that the heart is on the right instead of the left, but also in that this image is not composed of atomic nuclei and electrons, but of antinuclei and positrons. I suggest calling this type of transformation composite inversion.
    The concept of composite inversion can explain the "strange" behavior of κ mesons and many other facts that are now known. This concept also opens up the possibility of fundamentally changing our understanding of the so-called neutrino (an uncharged particle with a rest mass almost equal to zero). During a type of radioactive decay—the so-called β decay—the atomic nucleus emits this particle at the same time as it emits an electron.
    The physical effects obtained according to the new theory of "longitudinal" neutrinos can be quantitatively calculated and tested in experiments. Now it is up to the experimental physicists. They can confirm or refute this theory. Recent news indicates that in the United States, such experiments conducted by physicists have yielded affirmative results.
    The report concluded by stating that Academician Landau's conclusions contribute to the further development of research into the secrets of the atomic nucleus. At the same time, this conclusion clearly demonstrates the Marxist-Leninist theory of the material unity of the universe.
    (Xinhua News Agency editor's note: Chinese theoretical physicists Professor Li Zhengdao and Professor Yang Zhenning also proposed similar ideas in the United States last summer. The experiments mentioned in Academician Landau's speech were conducted under their suggestion by Associate Professor Wu Jianxiong, etc.)

    苏联科学院举行年会
    去年苏联物理学研究工作收获极大
    兰道院士提出复合反演论说明宇称守恒定律不具普遍性
    初步实验证实氢不需达到几百万度的温度也可以变为氦
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社23日报道：苏联科学院主席团学术秘书长托普切夫对苏联科学院年会的参加者说，1956年是苏联物理学——现代自然科学的主要部门——发展中收获极大的一年。在这一年中，科学院物理数学部研究了四十多个问题。
    托普切夫院士指出，在核子物理学方面的新研究中，极有意义的是兰道院士的工作，这项工作是发展基本粒子本质和特性的理论概念方面的重要的一步。通讯院士金兹堡和希克洛夫斯基教授提出的宇宙线起源的无线电天文学理论具有巨大的意义。通讯院士维克斯列尔领导的一些科学家提出了加速基本粒子的方法上的新主张，他们已经开始了使世界上最大的一百亿电子伏特的加速器开始运转的工作。现在正在设计更大的五百亿到六百亿电子伏特的加速器。
    苏联科学院年会是在2月22、23日在莫斯科举行的。科学家们在会上讨论了苏联科学院1956年度科学活动的结果，并且规划了进行下一步研究工作的前景。
    托普切夫在向年会所作的有关苏联科学院去年科学活动总结的报告中，还谈到了地质、天文学、力学、自动装置、无线电技术、生物学和社会科学等方面的研究成果。他指出，总天文台正在进行在天文学中使用电视技术的实验。电视器械被用来作为肉眼可以清楚看到的天体的亮度加强器。由于使用这种方法，在电视银幕上，月球表面形象的明亮度大约为天体望远镜上的形象的三百倍。
    托普切夫院士还着重谈到了在苏联东部、在国民经济飞速发展的地区发展科学的问题。他宣读了两位院士提出的关于在西伯利亚建立科学院的巨大科学中心的建议。这个建议得到了全体参加者的热烈赞同。
    年会赞同苏联科学院1956年科学活动的总结报告。
    人们还听了诺贝尔奖金获得者、科学院院士谢苗诺夫的题为“化学动力学和链锁反应”的讲演。
    新华社24日讯　苏联“真理报”15日发表一篇报道说，苏联科学院院士库尔查托夫领导的研究所最近在研究建造可控制的热核子反应的可能性上取得了重要成就。
    不久以前，在初步实验中证实了苏联科学院通讯院士泽尔多维奇的观念：氢在普通温度下可以变为较重的元素——氦，并不要求达到几百万度的温度。这当中起决定性作用的是μ介子，一种质量约为围绕原子核的电子的二百倍左右的一种基本粒子。
    在原子核物理学的新发现中还有苏联物理学家兰道院士在1956年提出的所谓复合反演论。兰道向苏联真理报记者解释新理论的实质说：
    原子核物理学在发展中依据的是表明时间和空间性质的规律。在物理学中特别起重大作用的是基于空间和时间对称性的所谓守恒定律：能量守恒定律和动量守恒定律。
    我们之中谁也不会怀疑，我们在镜中看到的空间同一般地没有什么不同。同时，大家也知道，在镜子里，左成了右，右成了左。在原子物理学中被称为宇称守恒定律的守恒定律是与这种情况相联系的。
    直到最近，对这一定律的正确性都没有产生过什么怀疑。一直到不久以前发现了所谓κ介子，才对这产生了怀疑，κ介子是一种质量约为电子九百六十倍的基本粒子。这种粒子的寿命是非常短的。现在已经确定，这种粒子可以裂变为两个π介子，也可以裂变为三个π介子。
    根据分析可以认为，裂变为两个π介子的κ介子应当具有同裂变为三个π介子的κ介子相反的宇称。然而实验材料越来越可靠地证明了两种κ介子是完全相同的。
    由此只可能得出一个结论：宇称守恒定律与物理学其他大多数定律不同，它并不具有普遍性，这种定律在基本粒子各种一般的相互作用中无疑是被遵守的，但是有时可能遭到破坏。
    乍一看，这个结论对现代物理学具有出人意料的性质，因为很难想像出放弃空间镜像对称的理由。但是据我看来，不久前就已经为这种情况找到了解释。
    我所提出的见解的实质就是，只有当一切粒子在镜像反射中都被反粒子所替代的情况下，才可能产生镜像对称。
    在这里只有空的空间——真空——才是完全镜像对称的。没有对称，这正是基本粒子的本性。可以用物理学家的语言打个譬喻说，人在镜子里的形像与人的不同不仅在于在形像中心脏在右面而不在左面，而且在于这种形像不是由原子核和电子组成，而是由反原子核和正电子组成。我建议把这一类变换叫做复合反演。
    复合反演的概念可以解释κ介子的“奇怪”行为以及现在已经知道的其他许多事实。这种概念也为在实质上改变我们对所谓中微子（静止质量几乎等于零的不带电粒子）的概念开辟了可能性。在一种放射衰变——所谓β衰变——的时候，原子核在放出电子的同时也放出这种粒子。
    按照“纵向的”中微子的新理论所得出的物理效应可以定量地计算出来和在实验中加以检验。现在要看实验物理学家们了。他们可以证实或推翻这一理论。最近有消息说，在美国，物理学家们所做的这种实验得到了肯定的结果。
    这篇报道最后写道，兰道院士的结论有助于探索原子核秘密的研究的进一步发展。同时，这种结论清楚地证明了马克思列宁主义关于宇宙是物质统一性的理论。
    （新华社编者按：中国理论物理学家李政道、杨振宁两位教授去年夏天在美国也已提出了类似的观念。兰道院士谈话中所提到的实验就是在他们建议下由吴健雄副教授等进行的。）
