Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 12th. Three hundred and fifty government cadres in Baoding City went to the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs on Sunday the 10th to do voluntary labor, helping the cooperative members with much-needed preparatory work for spring plowing. Among them, one hundred and thirty-five cadres spread 800 cartloads of manure, mashed 55 cartloads of manure, delivered 70 cartloads of manure, and removed 88 cartloads of manure from eight pig and sheep pens on 155 mu of wheat fields, and chopped a lot of fodder, etc.

This voluntary labor was initiated and organized by the Baoding Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee. The cadres brought their own dry rations, were assigned to ten production teams of the cooperative, and listened to the instructions of the production team leaders to carry out the labor happily. Among these cadres, there were veteran cadres who used to work in the countryside, and they were still very skilled at work; there were also cadres who had never worked in the fields before, and they quickly learned how to do farm work. Responsible cadres also participated in the labor with everyone.

The actions of the government cadres have further strengthened the ties with the people and vigorously encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members.

    保定市机关干部进行义务劳动帮助农民生产
    据新华社保定12日电　保定市有三百五十名机关干部，10日利用星期日前往郊区宏光农业社进行义务劳动，帮助社员们做了许多当前急需要做的备耕工作。其中一百三十五名干部就在一百五十五亩麦地上撒粪八百车、捣粪五十五车、送粪七十车、从八个猪羊圈起出粪肥八十八车、铡了很多饲草等。
    这次义务劳动是由中共保定市委员会和市人民委员会发动组织的。干部们自带了干粮，被分配到合作社的十个生产队里，听从生产队长的指挥，愉快地进行劳动。在这些干部中，有原先在农村工作的老干部，他们干起活来依然很熟练；有过去从未下地劳动过的干部，他们也很快学会了干农活。负责干部也和大家一起参加了劳动。
    机关干部们的这一行动，进一步密切了同人民群众的联系，有力地鼓舞了社员们的劳动热情。
