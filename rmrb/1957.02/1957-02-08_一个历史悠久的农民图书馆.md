    A Farmers' Library with a Long History
    The Zhejiang Provincial Library recently sent more than 500 picture story books and storybooks suitable for farmers to a farmers' library in Xidoumen Village, Zhuji County, which was established 26 years ago.
    This library is now a component of the "March 8th" Advanced Agricultural Cooperative's club. As early as 1930, Xidoumen Village had an underground Communist Party organization. In that year, under the leadership of the Party, the farmers in the village participated in an armed peasant uprising, which later failed. In order to unite and educate the peasant masses and persist in the revolutionary struggle, the Party led the farmers to establish this library through fundraising and voluntary labor, making it a school for learning revolutionary principles at the time. During the difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the farmers of Xidoumen Village, in order to protect the books from damage, used to put the books one by one into coffins at night and carry them to the mountains to bury them. In 1948, people took out the books that had been buried for many years. Now, this library still preserves broadswords, red-tasseled spears, and earthen cannons used by the farmers when they participated in the armed uprising in 1930.
    The library in Xidoumen Village has developed greatly since liberation. The library management personnel have added many books based on the characteristics of rural work in various periods. Now, this library has more than 4,000 books, making it the farmers' library with the most books in the province. The library also frequently organizes farmers to study, holds lectures, and conducts propaganda and organizes newspaper reading for the farmers.
    Due to the Xidoumen Village library's persistence in educating farmers for more than 20 years, more than 90% of the farmers in the village are now literate. When cadres in the cooperative encounter difficulties in their work, they go to the library to find solutions. The library also frequently helps nearby agricultural cooperatives carry out cultural work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一个历史悠久的农民图书馆
    浙江省图书馆最近把五百多册适合于农民看的各种连环画册和故事书，送给诸暨县西斗门村一个成立了二十六年的农民图书馆。
    这个图书馆现在是“三八”高级农业社俱乐部的一个组成部分。1930年的时候，西斗门村就有了共产党的地下组织。那一年，村子里的农民在党的领导下参加了一次农民武装起义，后来起义失败了。为了团结、教育农民群众，坚持革命斗争，党领导农民采取募捐和义务出工的办法建立起这个图书馆，成为当时学习革命道理的学校。西斗门村的农民在抗日战争和解放战争的艰苦年代里，为了保护图书不受损失，曾经在夜晚把图书一册册地装在棺材里，抬到山上去埋藏起来。1948年，人们才把埋藏多年的图书拿出来。现在，这个图书馆里还保存有1930年农民参加武装起义时用的大刀、红缨枪和土炮。
    西斗门村的图书馆在解放后有很大的发展。图书馆的管理人员根据各个时期农村工作的特点，添置了不少书籍。现在这个图书馆已经有四千多册藏书，是全省农民图书馆藏书最多的一个。图书馆还经常组织农民学习，举办讲座，向农民进行宣传和组织读报。
    由于西斗门村图书馆二十多年来坚持对农民进行教育，现在全村的农民90％以上都识字。社里的干部遇到工作上有困难，就到图书馆去找办法。图书馆还经常帮助附近农业社开展文化工作。　（新华社讯）
