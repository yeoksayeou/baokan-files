Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a meeting of secretaries of the League's provincial (municipal) committees from February 8th to 21st. The meeting focused on studying the current ideological education work of the Communist Youth League. During the meeting, Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Secretaries Tan Zhenlin, Yang Shangkun, and Hu Qiaomu received all the participants and gave specific instructions on the various tasks of the Communist Youth League.

Deng Xiaoping said that the work of the Communist Youth League in the past year had achieved greater results than in any previous year, and the contributions made by the youth were also particularly significant. Generally speaking, the situation of the youth is good, and the thoughts of the youth are progressing. Deng Xiaoping pointed out that ideological work is a long-term task. When old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will arise. Therefore, at no time should we overestimate our work. There is no such thing as a task that can be completed once and for all. Under the new circumstances, the work of the Communist Youth League should be led to a deeper level. There will still be vigorous activities in the future, but a large amount of work needs to be done bit by bit. The Communist Youth League should have an overall concept and reflect the opinions of the youth, representing the correct demands of the youth. The Communist Youth League is an advanced organization of the youth and should be made tighter in both organization and ideology.

After reporting and discussion, Hu Yaobang gave a summary of the meeting.

The meeting discussed the current domestic situation. The meeting held that the task of the Communist Youth League is to continuously enhance the Communist consciousness of the youth. The Communist Youth League should educate the youth to establish a Communist worldview, have a firm working-class stand, the idea of serving the working people loyally, and a spirit of not fearing difficulties or sacrifices. At the same time, the Communist Youth League should actively cultivate the youth's ability to correctly analyze concrete things and arm the youth with dialectical materialism. Youth are active and enthusiastic, but due to a lack of knowledge and experience, their thinking methods tend to be subjective and one-sided. Correct thinking methods are of particular importance to the youth. Only when the youth have the ability to correctly analyze concrete things can they distinguish between right and wrong and differentiate between enemies and friends in complex situations, thereby also strengthening their class stand and consolidating their revolutionary worldview.

The meeting held that it is necessary to particularly emphasize educating youth with the spirit of hard struggle, diligence and thrift in building the country, and collectivism. It was also pointed out that the method of integrating theory with practice must be adhered to in educating youth, that is, according to theory and policy, and in light of the situation at the time and place, enlighten youth to conduct discussions. If the method of instilling is adopted without going through the youth's own ideological activities, the effectiveness of education will not be great. For youths with wrong ideas, we must adhere to the policy of persuasion and education, and convince people with reason. For erroneous ideas with general educational significance, discussions can also be conducted among the masses to clarify right and wrong and improve everyone's understanding. In addition to persuasion and education, the organization should support the administration in giving necessary disciplinary sanctions to a very small number of people with bad conduct who have repeatedly refused to be corrected after education.

The meeting held that raising the ideological level of League members is an important link in raising the ideological level of the vast number of youth. Communist Youth League members should not only be activists in labor and study, but also, first and foremost, ideologically advanced elements. League organizations should strengthen the education of League members and improve their ideological level through political study and organizational life. In order to do a good job in ideological work, it is necessary to constantly investigate and study the ideological trends of the youth and strive to improve the theoretical level of the Communist Youth League cadres.

The meeting also specifically studied issues such as running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, and launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy in industrial and mining enterprises, and made arrangements for the work of the entire League this year.

    不断提高青年的共产主义自觉性
    青年团省市委书记会议研究加强思想教育工作
    新华社26日讯　青年团中央在2月8日到21日召开了团的各省（市）委书记会议，会议着重研究了青年团当前的思想教育工作。会议期间，中共中央书记处总书记邓小平、书记谭震林、候补书记杨尚昆、胡乔木等接见了参加会议的全体人员，对青年团的各项工作作了具体的指示。
    邓小平说，去年一年青年团的工作成绩比过去任何一年都大，青年所作的贡献也特别大。总的说来，青年的情况是好的，青年们的思想是前进的。邓小平指出，思想工作是长时期的工作，旧的矛盾解决了，又会产生新的矛盾。因此，任何时候都不要把自己的工作估计过高，一劳永逸的事情是没有的。在新的情况下，应当把青年团的工作引向深入。今后轰轰烈烈的事情还会有的，但是大量的事情是要一点一滴地去做的。青年团要有整体观念，又要反映青年的意见，代表青年正确的要求。青年团是青年的先进组织，要在组织上和思想上都搞得更紧一些。
    会议经过汇报和讨论，最后由胡耀邦作了总结。
    会议讨论了当前国内的情况。会议认为，青年团的任务，就是要不断地提高青年的共产主义自觉性。青年团要教育青年树立共产主义的人生观，具有坚定的工人阶级的立场，忠诚地为劳动人民服务的思想和不怕困难、不怕牺牲的精神，同时，青年团又要积极地培养青年正确地分析具体事物的能力，用辩证唯物主义去武装青年。青年积极、热情，但由于知识经验的不足，因此思想方法上往往容易主观、片面。正确的思想方法对青年有特别重要的意义。只有青年具有了正确地分析具体事物的能力，才能在复杂的情况下明辨是非，分清敌我，从而也坚定了阶级立场和巩固了革命的人生观。
    会议认为，当前应当特别强调以艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国和集体主义精神教育青年。同时指出在教育青年的工作上必须坚持理论联系实际的方法，即根据理论和政策，联系当时当地的情况启发青年来进行讨论。如果不通过青年自己的思想活动而采取灌输的方法，教育的实效是不大的。对于有错误思想的青年，必须坚持说服教育的方针，做到以理服人。对于具有普遍教育意义的错误思想还可以在群众中进行讨论，以明确是非，提高大家的认识。对于极个别的品行恶劣而又屡教不改的人，除了说服教育外，还应该支持行政给以必要的纪律制裁。
    会议认为，提高团员的思想水平是提高广大青年思想水平的一个重要环节。青年团员不但应该是劳动上、学习上的积极分子，而且首先应该是思想上的先进分子。团组织要通过政治学习和组织生活，加强对团员的教育，提高团员的思想水平。为要做好思想工作，必须经常调查研究青年的思想动态，并且努力提高青年团干部的理论水平。
    会议还具体研究了勤俭办社，争取今年农业大丰收和在工矿企业中开展增产节约运动等方面的问题，并对今年全团的工作作了部署。
