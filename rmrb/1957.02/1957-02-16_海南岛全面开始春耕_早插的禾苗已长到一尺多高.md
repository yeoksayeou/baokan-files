Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 14th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Man): When the first group of swallows flying from the Nanyang Islands brought the news of spring to Hainan Island, spring plowing here fully began.

In early December last year, when the northern lands were still covered with white snow, Qiongdong, Wanning, and Lehui counties on the southeastern coast, the earliest in the season, had already begun transplanting rice seedlings one after another. Soon, the central region also successively launched busy preparatory work for plowing. These past few days, after a spring rain, these areas have also begun transplanting rice seedlings in full swing. In parts of the western coast, where the season is latest, preparations for plowing are currently underway. At daybreak, farmers are already plowing the land in a vast expanse of white paddy fields, shouting at the water buffalo.

Before the spring plowing, the counties of Hainan Island successively convened cadre meetings, criticizing the lack of confidence in this year's production among some cadres. During the spring plowing period, from county party secretaries to township branch committee members, all went deep into townships, communes, and fields to specifically lead production. When some farmers in Wanning County learned that the county head was also rolling up his trousers to plow the land, they all said, "The county head is going to the fields, how can we not go to the fields?" As a result, many agricultural cooperatives completed the rice transplanting work quickly and well. The Dalu Cooperative in Qiongdong County proposed "no idle hands in the fields." Every member participating in rice transplanting also took the opportunity to carry a load of fertilizer to the fields, greatly improving work efficiency. The entire township completed rice transplanting eleven days ahead of schedule.

Before transplanting rice seedlings, agricultural cooperatives in various counties also conducted education on technical reforms for their members by summarizing the production achievements and lessons from last year. Judging from the rice seedlings that have already been transplanted, many agricultural cooperatives have implemented close planting with small clusters in 70% of their paddy fields; among them, many have implemented close planting with single or double seedlings. The technical reforms throughout the region are generally better than last year.

This year, Hainan Island has a warm climate and abundant rainfall. As soon as the seedlings are transplanted, they turn green in a few days. Now, the early rice seedlings transplanted on the east coast have grown to over a foot tall.

### 海南岛全面开始春耕  早插的禾苗已长到一尺多高

    海南岛全面开始春耕
    早插的禾苗已长到一尺多高
    新华社广州14日电　新华社记者王曼报道：第一群从南洋群岛飞来的燕子带着春天的信息飞到海南岛的时候，这里的春耕全面开始了。
    在去年12月初，北方大地还复盖着皑皑白雪的时候，季节最早的东南岸琼东、万宁和乐会三个县，便已陆续开始插秧。不久，中部地区也相继展开繁忙的备耕工作。这几天，一场春雨刚刚下过，这些地区也已开始全面插秧。季节最迟的西海岸部分地区，目前正在紧张的备耕，天刚亮，农民们就在一片白茫茫的水田里，?喝着水牛开始翻地。
    海南岛各县在春耕前都先后召开了干部会议，批判了部分干部对搞好今年生产信心不足的情绪。春耕期间从县委书记到乡支部委员都深入到乡、社和田间，具体进行领导生产。万宁县的一些农民当他们知道县长也卷起裤筒在翻地的时候，都说：“县长都下田，我们怎能不下田呢？”由此，许多农业社的插秧工作做得又快又好。琼东县大路社提出“下田无闲手”，每个参加插秧的社员下地时都顺便挑一担肥下田，大大提高了工作效率，全乡提前十一天完成了插秧工作。
    在插秧前，各县农业社还通过总结去年的生产成绩和教训，对社员进行了技术改革的教育。从目前已插下的禾苗看，许多农业社70％的稻田都实行了小株密植；其中还有许多实行单、双株密植。全区的技术改革一般都比去年做得好。
    今年海南岛气候温暖，雨水充沛，秧苗一插下去，不几天便回青。现在，东海岸早插的禾苗已长到一尺多高了。
