    Since the Party issued the call to "March towards science" and proposed the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom," the field of economics has also shown a lively scene. Debates on various issues have unfolded one after another, and naturally, new research results will emerge more frequently. However, judging from the situation in the past period, there is one task that still needs to be brought to everyone's attention, and that is the collection, organization, and publication of economic data.
    Systematic data on various economic issues are not only an important basis for the Party and state organs to formulate policies and guidelines and plan work, but also indispensable for economic scientific research, teaching, and propaganda work among the broad masses. Due to the extreme corruption of the reactionary regime and the weakness of the national bourgeoisie in the past, the legacy that old China left us in this regard is extremely poor. Although the Party and the government have always attached importance to the investigation and research of China's social and economic conditions, and many Party organs and government departments have conducted investigations on various economic issues and accumulated a large amount of data, a large part of these data has not yet been systematically organized due to the heavy construction tasks and the shortage of cadres, and cannot be directly used to serve the research work of economic science.
    In the past few years, the economic circles have made certain contributions in organizing the data of modern Chinese economic history and have published several data books with high standards. But on the whole, the collection, organization, and publication of various economic data is still very weak, far from meeting the needs of carrying out economic scientific research and other work. Many issues regarding China's economic history before 1949 still lack relatively accurate and complete data. Since liberation, China's economy has undergone fundamental changes. The feudal system that has lasted for thousands of years has completely perished, and the capitalist economy and the small-peasant economy are also close to being completely eliminated. However, such a huge event has not been reflected and summarized by relatively detailed and systematic data that has been organized. The economic situation of other brother countries within the socialist camp besides the Soviet Union, as well as the economic situation of capitalist countries, is also very insufficiently reflected, mostly limited to sporadic and fragmentary information. Therefore, comrades engaged in teaching, research, and practical work have to start from scratch to establish their own set of data. This disperses their energy, prevents them from concentrating on their main work, and often because of the limitations of time, economic ability, and lack of reference books, although they have spent a lot of effort collecting data, they do not achieve much results. This situation cannot but cause great difficulties for the work, thus greatly affecting the progress of the work. At present, in academic research, there are many major issues, such as the problem of the budding of Chinese capitalism and the problem of the original accumulation of Chinese capitalism, which cannot be well resolved. One of the main reasons is the lack of data. Some major theoretical issues in the current socialist economic construction, such as the problem of formulating the objective basis for China's product costs and prices and the problem of comprehensive balance in national economic planning, are also very difficult to solve due to insufficient data. We can also see that many academic works often repeatedly cite old sets of materials, and general articles explaining theories or publicizing policies lack vivid materials. In the debates on many issues, the articles participating in the debate also mostly lack a relatively comprehensive analysis of the objective economic situation, often drawing conclusions from one-sided facts, or stopping the debate at the deduction of concepts and logic. In order to change the above situation, it is necessary to greatly strengthen the collection, organization, and publication of economic data. It is reported that several kinds of data on modern Chinese economic history have been compiled by some economists and will be published successively. This is very gratifying. It is hoped that more people can participate in this meaningful work so that more data books including various subjects can be continuously produced.
    Some people think that "compiling data is just copying here and there, which is meaningless." This is a very wrong view. Data work is an important part of scientific research work, and doing this work well requires rich specialized knowledge and arduous labor. For example, to compile a data book on economic history, it is necessary to collect all the relevant data that can be collected, and to extract useful things from such a sea of data; it is also necessary to logically reflect the development process of history and reveal the most important phenomena in history. Therefore, the process of compiling data is also a process of increasing a large amount of practical knowledge and laying the foundation for research work.
    I think that the work of collecting and organizing data can be started from the following aspects:
    The first is field investigation. Such as typical investigations of the production and operation of one or several regions, several factories, several stores, and several agricultural production cooperatives, or typical investigations of the living conditions of residents in one or several cities, one or several villages, etc. Some historical data can also use this method of field investigation.
    The second is to systematically collect and organize the existing large amount of written data. Such as the archives and documents of various organs and groups before liberation, the account books and contract documents of enterprises, special investigation reports, newspapers, magazines, yearbooks, industry chronicles, local chronicles, collections of essays, biographies, and other various writings, and so on. In the past, Japanese imperialists, in order to plunder our country, conducted detailed investigations on certain aspects of China's economy and left behind a lot of investigation materials; individuals or groups from other countries have also done some investigation and research. These data can be critically organized and utilized. China's private enterprises have all been jointly operated, and the large amount of account books and contract document data they have preserved are very good data for studying China's private capitalist economy. All these data, as well as the various economic investigation and statistical data mastered by various economic departments since the founding of the country in 1949, need to mobilize and organize the strength of all parties (mainly the strength of various economic management organs and research institutions) to divide the work to organize. The work of translating foreign economic data also needs to be organized in a planned way.
    The third is to mobilize some people who have had rich experience in the old society (old workers, old shop assistants, capitalists, old officials, etc.) to write memoirs, autobiographies, or to obtain vivid materials through interview records and organizing their oral accounts of their deeds. The cruel oppression and exploitation suffered by workers in old China can be obtained through such investigations of some old workers. China's national capitalists were oppressed by imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism in the past. They had complex and acute struggles with the latter, and at the same time had varying degrees of contact. Such materials are not abundant in the publicly available documents at that time and can also be obtained through this investigation.
    The collection, organization, and compilation of data is a work that requires a lot of manpower and time. The publishing department should promote and organize this work in a planned way so that the strength in this area can be used most effectively. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that this work is very serious. The data compiled and published should reflect the objective reality as truthfully and accurately as possible and have a considerable scientific level. I believe that the vigorous development of this work will surely greatly promote the prosperity of China's economic science and accelerate the development speed of economic scientific research work.

### 重视经济资料的收集、整理和出版工作

    重视经济资料的收集、整理和出版工作	刘义立
    自从党发出了“向科学进军”的号召并提出“百家争鸣”的方针以来，经济学界也呈现出活跃的景象，各种问题的论争纷纷展开，自然，新的研究成果也将会更多地涌现出来。但是从过去这一时期的情况看来，有一项工作还有必要提请大家重视，这就是经济资料的收集、整理和出版工作。
    关于各种经济问题的系统的资料，不仅是党和国家机关制定政策方针、规划工作的重要依据，同时也是经济科学的研究和教学以及向广大群众进行宣传工作所不可缺少的。由于过去反动政权的极端腐朽和民族资产阶级的软弱，旧中国在这方面所留给我们的遗产是极其贫乏的。虽然党和政府一贯重视对中国社会经济情况的调查研究，党的许多机关和政府部门对各种经济问题也曾作过调查，积累了大量的资料。但是由于建设任务的繁重和干部的不足，这些资料的很大一部分至今还没有经过系统的整理，还不可能直接用来为经济科学的研究工作服务。
    几年来，经济学界在整理中国近代经济史的资料方面作出了一定的贡献，出版过几本有较高水平的资料书。但是整个说来，对各种经济资料的收集、整理和出版的工作还非常薄弱，远不能适应开展经济科学研究工作和其他工作的需要。关于1949年以前我国经济史方面的许多问题都还没有比较精确和完整的资料。解放以来，我国经济已经有了根本的变化，延续了几千年之久的封建制度已完全灭亡，资本主义经济和小农经济也接近于完全消灭。但这样巨大的事件还没有用经过整理的比较详细而系统的资料来给以反映和总结。对于社会主义阵营内除了苏联以外的其他兄弟国家的经济情况以及资本主义国家的经济情况反映得也非常不够，大多只限于零星的和片断的。因此，做教学工作、研究工作和实际工作的同志，不得不从头开始建立自己的一套资料。这样就分散了他们的精力，使他们不能够集中力量于自己的主要工作，并且往往因为时间，经济能力的限制和参考书的缺乏，虽然他们花了很大气力去收集资料，却收不到多大效果，这种情况不能不给工作造成很大的困难，因而大大地影响了工作进展。目前在学术研究中，有许多重大的问题，如中国资本主义萌芽问题、中国资本主义原始积累问题等之所以得不到很好的解决，其主要原因之一就是资料的不足。目前社会主义经济建设中的一些重大的理论问题，如制定我国产品成本、价格的客观依据问题、国民经济计划化中的综合平衡问题等，也因资料不足，以致解决起来非常吃力。我们还可以看到，许多学术论著往往翻来复去地引用老一套的材料，一般解释理论或宣传政策的文章也缺少生动的材料。在许多问题的争论上，参加争论的文章也多半缺乏对于客观经济情况的比较全面的分析，常常从片面的事实出发来下结论，或者把争论停留在概念和逻辑的推演。为了改变以上的情况，必须大大加强对于经济资料的收集、整理和出版的工作。据悉关于中国近代经济史方面的几种资料已经由一些经济学者编成，即将陆续出版，这是很可喜的事。希望有更多的人能参加这一有意义的工作，使更多的包括各种题材的资料书能够不断地产生出来。
    有的人认为“编资料就是东抄抄、西抄抄，没有什么意思”。这是很错误的看法。资料工作是科学研究工作的重要组成部分，做好这种工作，需要具备丰富的专门知识和支付艰巨的劳动。例如编一本经济史方面的资料书，需要收集一切可能搜集到的一切有关的资料，从这样的资料大海里淘出有用的东西；还要逻辑地反映历史的发展过程，揭示历史中最重要的现象。所以说，编资料的过程同时也是增长大量实际知识，为研究工作奠定基础的过程。
    我认为，收集和整理资料的工作可以从下面几个方面着手去做：
    第一种是实地调查。如对一个或几个地区、若干工厂、若干商店、若干农业生产合作社的生产、经营状况的典型调查，或对一个或几个城市、一个或几个村庄的居民生活状况的典型调查等。有的历史资料也可以采用这种实地调查的方法。
    第二种是对现有的大量文字资料进行系统的收集和整理。如解放前各种机关团体的档案文献，企业的账册、契约文书、专门的调查报告、报纸、杂志、年鉴、实业志、地方志、文集、人物传记以及其他各种著述，等等。过去日本帝国主义者为了掠夺我国，曾对我国经济的某些方面作过详细的调查，留下了不少的调查材料；其他国家的个人或团体也作过一些调查研究。这些资料都可以批判地加以整理和利用。我国的私营企业已全部合营，它们所保存下来的大量账册和契约文书资料是研究我国私人资本主义经济的很好的资料。所有这些资料以及1949年建国以来各经济部门所掌握的各种经济调查统计资料，都需要发动和组织各方面的力量（主要是各经济管理机关和研究机关的力量）分工去整理。对于外国经济资料的编译工作也需要有计划地组织力量去做。
    第三种是发动一些在旧社会有过丰富经历的人（老职工、老店员、资本家、旧官吏等）写回忆录、自传，或通过访问记录和整理他们口述的事迹。旧中国工人所受的残酷压迫和剥削，如果向一些老职工作这样的调查，可以获得生动的材料。中国的民族资本家过去受帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本主义的压迫，他们和后者之间有着复杂尖锐的斗争，同时又有不同程度的联系，这种材料在当时公开的文献上是不多的，也可以通过这种调查得到。
    资料的收集、整理和编纂是需要耗费很多人力和时间的工作，出版部门应当有计划地来推动和组织这一项工作，使这方面的力量能够得到最有效的使用。同时也应指出，这一项工作是很严肃的工作，编纂出版的资料应当尽可能真实、确切地反映客观实际，并具有相当的科学水平。我相信，这一项工作的大力展开，必定会大大促进我国经济科学的繁荣，加快经济科学研究工作的发展速度。
