Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th: According to a "New York Times" report on the 7th, the American Newspaper Publishers Association sent a telegram to Eisenhower and Congress on the 6th, protesting the State Department's ban on American journalists visiting China.

The association requested the cancellation of the US government's restrictions on American journalists conducting news interviews in any country not at war with the United States.

The association demanded that the US government respect three principles: First, American journalists employed by American publishing companies and news organizations can freely travel to "any country in the world not at war with the United States" to interview and write news. Second, in cases where the country the journalist is visiting is not at war with the United States, there should be no restrictions on the passports of American citizens engaged in writing and interviewing news. Third, American journalists who, of their own volition, wish to engage in their profession in any country in the world not at war with the United States should not be subject to fines or imprisonment, or have their right to travel revoked.

On the same day, the "New York Times" published two editorials criticizing Dulles' recent defense of the State Department's ban on American journalists visiting China. Dulles said at a press conference on the 5th that the State Department banned journalists from visiting China because the United States did not want American criminals detained in China to be "used as a means of exerting pressure on the US government," and said that "as long as we have not recognized that regime, we will not issue passports to Communist China under any circumstances."

The newspaper pointed out: "The State Department used to say that it opposed such travel because it could not protect the journalists who made such trips. Perhaps Dulles realized that this argument was untenable, so he now felt compelled to come up with something new, different, and extremely strange." The "New York Times" pointed out that Dulles' new argument was no more grounded or convincing than his past arguments.

The editorial said: "Dulles, who used to be a lawyer, has probably discovered that his hindsight is flawed, so he has added an inexcusable insinuation that any journalist who can enter Beijing will be "selected" by the Communists. The implication is clear: anyone who violates Dulles' ban is necessarily a Communist suspect." The "New York Times" said: "This is a despicable slander against many journalists of high character who have already been approved for entry by Beijing. This is a final, base tactic employed by someone who has made a willful, indefensible mistake and lacks the virtue of admitting it."

The "Washington Star," "Christian Science Monitor," "Baltimore Sun," and "Wall Street Journal" also attacked Dulles' excuses for banning journalists from visiting China.

Democratic Senator Humphrey also commented on the ban on journalists visiting China on the 9th, saying that the State Department's attitude "unreasonably insults the right to travel and is an intolerable interference with the right to know." Humphrey said he would ask the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to investigate the State Department's refusal to issue passports to American journalists traveling to China.

### 美国报界致电艾森豪威尔和国会  抗议禁止美国记者访问中国

    美国报界致电艾森豪威尔和国会
    抗议禁止美国记者访问中国
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：据7日“纽约时报”报道，美国报纸出版商协会6日向艾森豪威尔和国会发了电报，抗议国务院禁止美国记者访问中国。
    协会要求取消美国官方对美国记者在任何一个没有同美国交战的国家内进行新闻采访活动的限制。
    协会要求美国政府尊重三项原则：一，美国出版公司和新闻机关雇佣的美国记者可以自由地到“全世界任何一个没有同美国交战的国家”去采访和编写新闻。二，在记者所去的国家不是同美国交战的国家的情况下，不能对从事编写和采访新闻的美国公民的护照加以限制。三，对于出自自己的心愿而愿意到世界上任何一个没有同美国交战的国家去进行他们的本行活动的美国记者不能处以罚款或徒刑，或者取消旅行权。
    同一天的“纽约时报”发表了两篇社论，抨击杜勒斯最近为国务院不准美国记者访问中国的禁令所作的辩护。杜勒斯在5日的记者招待会上说，国务院禁止记者访问中国的理由是美国不希望在中国被拘押的美国罪犯被中国“利用作为对美国政府施加压力的手段”，并且说“只要是我们还没有承认那个政权，那末，在任何情况下，我们都不会颁发前往共产党中国的护照”。
    这家报纸指出：“国务院以前说，它所以反对这种旅行，是因为它不能保护去作这种旅行的记者。也许杜勒斯认识到这种论点站不住脚，以致现在感觉到必须提出某种新的、不同的和极其奇怪的东西。”“纽约时报”指出，杜勒斯的新的论据并不比他过去的论据有根据或者令人信服。
    社论说：“过去作过律师的杜勒斯大概已经发觉他的事后聪明有破绽，因此他又加上这样一种不可饶恕的暗示，即可以进入北京的任何记者将是由共产党“挑选”的。言外之意是明白的，任何违犯杜勒斯禁令的人必然是一个共产党嫌疑犯。”“纽约时报”说：“这是对于已经被北京批准入境的具有高尚品格的许多新闻记者的卑鄙诽谤。这是一个犯了任性的、无可辩护的大错而又缺乏承认错误的美德的人所采用的一种最后的下流办法。”
    “华盛顿明星报”、“基督教科学箴言报”、“巴尔的摩太阳报”和“华尔街日报”也对杜勒斯对禁止记者访问中国的遁辞进行了抨击。
    民主党参议员汉弗来也在9日就禁止记者访问中国发表意见说，国务院的态度“无理地侮辱了旅行的权利，并且是不能容忍地干涉了了解情况的权利。”汉弗来说，他将要求参议院外交委员会调查国务院拒绝发给美国记者前往中国去的护照一事。
