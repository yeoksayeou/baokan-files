    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th: According to the latest statistics from the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Statistics, Hubei Province's industry has completed the total output value plan of the First Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. In four years, the province's total industrial output value increased by 158%, with an average annual increase of 27%. The output of eighteen major products such as pig iron, steel, steel products, cast iron pipes, cement, and internal combustion engines has reached the 1957 level ahead of schedule. Compared with 1952, steel production increased three times, steel products increased 2.8 times, cement increased 2.2 times, and electricity increased 2.3 times.
    Before liberation, Hubei Province's machine manufacturing industry was mainly engaged in repair and assembly. Now, it can produce freight cars, civilian ships, metal cutting machine tools, diesel engines, gas engines, electric motors, winches, tower cranes, etc. The Wuhan Machine Tool Factory had only over one hundred people and more than twenty old machines in the early days of liberation. Now, it has become a modern enterprise with more than one thousand employees specializing in the production of precision tool grinders. The Hubei Farm Tool Factory, which could only repair and assemble in the past, can now also produce various new types of farm tools.
    From 1953 to 1956, Hubei Province built, renovated, and expanded nearly 300 industrial enterprises. Among them are large enterprises such as the Hanyang Sleeper Anti-Corrosion Plant, the Wuhan No. 3 Power Plant, and the Wuhan Frozen Meat Processing Plant, most of which have been put into production. Therefore, in 1956, the proportion of modern industry based on mechanical power in the province's total industrial production increased from 75% in 1952 to 87%.
    In the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, industrial enterprises in Hubei Province also successfully trial-produced more than 300 relatively important new products such as No. 800 high-grade cement, high-grade alloy steel, high-quality spring steel, stainless heat-resistant steel, regularly deformed steel bars, and threshers.

    提前一年完成五年计划的总产值计划
    湖北省工业生产增长一倍半
    新华社武汉8日电　根据湖北省统计局最近统计，湖北省工业已经提前一年完成了第一个五年计划的总产值计划。四年内，这个省的工业总产值共增长了158％，平均每年递增27％。生铁、钢、钢材、铁铸管、水泥、内燃机等十八种主要产品的产量，都提前达到了1957年的水平。同1952年相比，钢的产量增加三倍，钢材增加二点八倍，水泥增加二点二倍，电增长二点三倍。
    解放前，湖北省的机器制造工业主要是修配性质，现在，已经能生产货车、民用船舶、金属切削机床、柴油机、煤气机、电动机、卷扬机、塔式起重机等。武汉机床厂解放初期只有一百多人和二十多台陈旧机器，现在已成为拥有一千多职工、专门生产精密工具磨床的现代化企业。原来只能修配的湖北农具厂现在也能生产各种新式农具。
    在1953年到1956年中，湖北省新建、改建和扩建了近三百个工业企业。其中有汉阳枕木防腐厂、武汉第三发电厂、武汉冻肉加工厂等大型企业，这些企业大部分已经投入生产。因此，1956年全省以机械动力为基础的现代工业在全部工业生产中的比重已由1952年的75％上升到87％。
    在五年计划前四年中，湖北省工业企业还试制成功了八百号高级水泥、高级合金钢、优质弹簧钢、不锈耐热钢、规律变形钢筋、脱谷机等三百多种较重要的新产品。
