Xinhua News Agency, Kandy, 2nd. Yesterday afternoon, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long visited Kandy, the ancient capital of Ceylon, from Colombo. They received an extremely warm welcome from the people of Ceylon on the way and upon arriving in Kandy.

They left Queen's House (Governor's Residence) in Colombo at 2 p.m. As their car drove onto the street, the crowd that had been gathering in front of the building since Premier Zhou's arrival erupted in enthusiastic cheers. The car passed through the cheering, waving crowd. People gathered in the middle of the street under the scorching sun, for several miles, leaving only a narrow passage. The crowd constantly shouted "Jayawewa" (May you be successful) and "Ayubowan" (Welcome). The guests' car was able to move quickly only after reaching the suburbs, but even in the suburbs, enthusiastic, smiling men, women, and children stood by the roadside.

Next was a seventy-mile journey, along which there were crowds, large and small, every few minutes, lining the road to welcome them. The road passed through beautiful countryside. The Chinese guests passed through endless coconut, palm, banana, rubber tree forests and various tropical forests, as well as gardens with beautiful flowers and fertile rice fields. On the road, elephants walked slowly, with mahouts riding on their backs, and some elephants bathed in the river. In addition to passing through many villages, the guests also passed through dozens of towns.

The towns the guests passed through were crowded with people and decorated with homemade flags and banners. Welcome slogans were hung on the streets, some written in Chinese. In some places, the sound of firecrackers drowned out the cheers, and local musicians played drums and trumpets, while seated women rapidly beat large drums to express their welcome. Many villagers dropped their sickles and ran from the rice fields to the road to see the guests.

About five miles from Kandy, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long's car was stopped by the crowd on a bridge. There, amid thunderous cheers and a shower of flowers, they were welcomed by officials from the Kandy Municipal Authorities and received the garlands they offered. As Zhou Enlai's car was about to leave, people stuffed coconut flowers and bouquets through the windows, placing them in Zhou Enlai's hands.

From there, the guests' car left the main road and passed through the garden-like University of Ceylon, built on a beautiful mountain. There, they were warmly welcomed by the students, and the university's Vice-Chancellor held a tea party to welcome them.

The guests continued their journey, passing the famous botanical gardens, where Zhou Enlai was invited to plant a tropical shrub seedling with a silver shovel and spade.

When Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long arrived in Kandy, the beautiful lakeside city was teeming with people. Zhou Enlai was immediately solemnly led into the large square surrounded by mountains to meet with the citizens of Kandy attending the civic reception. Zhou Enlai passed through many arches and roads paved with fresh coconut leaves under the cover of a large white umbrella, and walked to the flower-decorated balcony overlooking the square, preceded by eight guards holding spears and flanked by two mica fans. An official said that this was the traditional Ceylonese ceremony for receiving distinguished guests.

The Mayor of Kandy delivered a speech welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long. He mentioned the historical relations between China and Ceylon and the current friendly relations between the two countries, which are mutually beneficial.

Zhou Enlai said that he felt very honored to be able to visit Kandy, the ancient capital and cultural center of Ceylon. He recalled Faxian's visit to Ceylon fifteen hundred years ago and the recent history of the two countries. He said that because of this, the warm welcome from the people of Ceylon was particularly moving to the Chinese guests. He said: "We regard your enthusiasm as an encouragement to our visit, which is aimed at seeking friendship."

The last item on the Chinese Premiers' schedule for the day was a visit to the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, where they saw a golden pagoda containing the Buddha's tooth and exquisite gold artifacts used during prayers. Zhou Enlai donated 10,000 rupees to the temple.

The Chinese Premiers will spend the night in the King's Pavilion. On the 2nd, they will depart for Sigiriya and Polonnaruwa.

    周总理访康提
  新华社康提2日电　昨天下午，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理由科伦坡前往锡兰古都康提访问。在途中和到达康提的时候，受到了锡兰人民极为热烈的欢迎。
    他们在下午两点离开科伦坡女王大厦（总督府）。当他们的汽车开到街上的时候，在周总理到达以后一直聚集在大厦前面的人群发出了热烈的欢呼。汽车从不断欢呼、频频挥手的人群中间穿过。人们在烈日下聚集在街道中央，足足有好几英里长，中间只留出一条很窄的通道。人群中不断发出“贾威伐”（百事顺利）和“艾博恩”（欢迎）的欢呼声。客人们的车子一直到了郊外才能够快速前进，但是就是在郊外，路旁也站着热情的、微笑的男女和儿童。
    接着是一段七十英里的行程，一路上隔不了几分钟就有大大小小的人群夹道欢迎。路上经过的是美丽的乡村。中国客人经过了无穷无尽的椰子、棕榈、香蕉、橡胶树林和各种各样的热带树林，以及有着美丽的鲜花的花园和嘉实累累的稻田。在公路上，大象缓缓地走着，驾象的人骑在象背上，也有的象在河中洗澡。客人们除了经过许多村庄以外，还经过了几十座城镇。
    客人们所经过的各城镇都挤满了人，并且装饰着自制的旗积和横幅。街道上挂着欢迎标语，有些还是用中文写的。在有些地方，爆竹声掩过了欢呼声，当地的乐师打着鼓，吹着喇叭，围坐的妇女急速敲着大鼓表示欢迎。有许多村民放下镰刀，从稻田跑到大路上来看客人。
    在约离康提五英里的地方，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理的汽车在桥上被群众堵住了。在那里，他们在雷动的欢呼声中，在一阵阵撒下来的鲜花中，受到康提市政当局官员的欢迎，并接受了他们所献的花环。在周恩来的汽车要开走的时候，人们从车窗中塞进了椰子花和花束，放在周恩来的手中。
    从那里起，客人的汽车离开大路，经过建筑在美丽的山上的花园般的锡兰大学。在那里，他们受到了学生的热烈欢迎，大学的副校长举行茶会欢迎他们。
    客人们继续他们的行程，驶过著名的植物园，在那里周恩来被邀请用银锹和银铲种植了一种热带灌木的树苗。
    当周恩来总理和贺龙副总理到达康提的时候，这个美丽的湖滨城市中人山人海。周恩来立即被隆重地引入群山环绕的大广场，去同参加市民招待会的康提公民会见。周恩来在一个大白伞的复罩下经过许多拱门和用鲜嫩的椰子叶铺的路，走到俯瞰广场的用鲜花装饰的阳台上，在他前面引路的是八个握着长矛的卫士，两旁是两个用云母做的扇子。一位官员说，这是锡兰接待显赫人物的传统仪式。
    康提市长致词欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理。他提到中锡两国之间的历史关系和目前两国之间的对彼此都有利的友好关系。
    周恩来说，他能够访问康提这个锡兰古都和文化中心，感到非常荣幸。他追述了法显在一千五百年以前到锡兰的访问，和最近两国的历史。他说，正因为如此，锡兰人民的热烈欢迎特别使中国客人们感动。他说：“我们认为你们的热诚是对我们这次目的在于寻求友谊的访问的一种鼓励。”
    中国总理们在这一天里的最后日程是访问康提的佛牙寺，他们在那里看到了一个金塔，里面装有佛牙和做祷告的时候使用的精致的金制物品。周恩来赠送了一万卢比给这个寺院。
    中国总理们在国王的亭阁里过夜。2日他们要动身前往锡吉里亚和波隆纳鲁瓦访问。
