    Dowry
    Ge Jing
    A string of silver bells echoes across the hills,
    An old man returns to the village from the market,
    His ox cart laden with copper bowls and colorful skirts,
    A round, black water jar sways.
    Apple-sized apples bend the branches low,
    Golden rice ears pile high above the tile roofs,
    The ox cart travels through the fields of harvest,
    A long drum accompanies the sound of the flails.
    The girls picking apples,
    Drop their bamboo baskets and crowd around;
    Chattering, laughing, calling, singing,
    Competing to try on the colorful skirts. …
    A flock of cranes flies into the orchard,
    The evening breeze carries the scent of fresh rice;
    The old man gazes at his granddaughter hiding behind the fruit trees,
    His white beard smiles and flutters past his nose.

    嫁妆
    葛静
    一阵阵银铃过山岗，
    老爷爷赶集回村庄，
    牛车满载铜碗、彩裙，
    黑圆的水罐乱摇晃。
    碗大的苹果坠弯了枝条，
    金黄的稻穗堆过瓦房，
    牛车驶过丰收的田野，
    长鼓伴着槤枷响。
    正在摘苹果的姑娘啊，
    丢下竹篓，一拥而上；
    吵着，笑着，叫着，唱着，
    争着把彩裙往身上量。……
    一群仙鹤飞进果园，
    晚风送来新穗香；
    老爷爷望着那躲在果树后的孙女，
    白胡子笑得飘过了鼻梁。
