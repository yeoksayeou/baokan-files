Xinhua News Agency, 17th: In China's vast pastoral area, stretching from the Greater Khingan Mountains in the east to the Pamir Plateau in the west, livestock has more than doubled in seven years.

According to recent statistics, the four autonomous regions and provinces with a relatively large proportion of animal husbandry, namely Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Qinghai, now have more than 74 million head of livestock (excluding pigs). The number of large livestock such as cattle and horses has increased nearly twofold compared to 1949, while sheep have increased 1.2 times.

In these four autonomous regions and provinces, animal husbandry is mainly managed by people of Mongolian, Tibetan, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Yugur ethnic minorities, as well as Han farmers in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. In recent years, they have provided a large amount of livestock products, draught animals, and working animals for other sectors of the national economy and for all ethnic groups. From 1952 to 1956, the state purchased more than 250 million jin of sheep wool in these four provinces and regions. If all this wool were woven into wool fabric, it could be used to sew tens of millions of woolen suits. If it were all exported, it could be exchanged for more than one million tons of steel. These provinces and regions supply tens of thousands of tons of meat to major cities and industrial and mining areas across the country every year. Last November, more than 1,000 tons of frozen meat exported from China to Egypt were also shipped from the Inner Mongolian grasslands. Pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, and other places also support agricultural production in Northeast, North, and Northwest China with tens of thousands of strong plough cattle and working mules and horses every year. Gansu and Xinjiang, regions close to the Gobi Desert, once transported more than 10,000 camels to support transportation in Tibet. Before roads were built in Tibet, camel teams had reached the foothills of the Himalayas.

The development of animal husbandry in these regions has improved the lives of local people of all ethnic groups, especially ethnic minority herdsmen. The average purchasing power of Tibetan herdsmen in some parts of Qinghai increased more than twofold from 1953 to 1955. With the development of animal husbandry, cultural undertakings in pastoral areas have also developed rapidly. The number of primary school students among the Tibetan people in Qinghai, and the Kyrgyz and Tajik people in Xinjiang, has increased fivefold to sevenfold in the past few years.

The development of animal husbandry in these regions is mainly due to the correct implementation of ethnic policies, the implementation of a series of policies and measures to develop production in pastoral areas, such as not struggling, not dividing, not classifying classes, benefiting both herdsmen and herd owners, supporting poor herdsmen, and organizing mutual support between industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. According to preliminary statistics, from 1950 to 1956, the state issued loans of more than 200 million yuan to ethnic minority herdsmen in these four provinces and regions. The state organizes the supply and direct allocation of hundreds of millions of jin of grain to the pastoral areas of the four provinces and regions every year, and also supplies pastoral areas with a large number of tea, cloth, lawn mowers, waterwheels, and other living and production materials every year. With the help of the state, herdsmen of all ethnic groups and farmers engaged in animal husbandry have diligently developed animal husbandry production.

The socialist factors that are gradually growing in the vast pastoral areas are playing an increasingly important role in the development of animal husbandry. In the past few years, more than 200 state-owned ranches have been established in these four provinces and regions, with more than one million head of livestock. According to the original mutual aid habits of herdsmen, mutual aid organizations have been widely developed in various pastoral areas. Since last year, a number of livestock production cooperatives have been established in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, and pastoral cooperatives have also begun to be piloted in Qinghai and Gansu. By the end of last year, more than 1,230 pastoral cooperatives had been established in these four provinces and regions, with the number of herdsmen joining cooperatives in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang reaching more than 20% of the total number of herding households. The net increase rate of livestock in these pastoral cooperatives is mostly higher than that of individual herdsmen in the area. At the same time, some pastoral areas have also piloted a number of joint state-private ranches according to the requirements of herd owners.

These state-owned ranches, livestock production cooperatives, and joint state-private ranches are playing a good demonstration role in improving feeding management, improving livestock breeds, preventing and controlling animal diseases, organizing diversified operations, and carrying out grassland infrastructure construction.

### 东起大兴安岭西到帕米尔高原  广阔的北方牧业地带牲畜倍增

    东起大兴安岭西到帕米尔高原
    广阔的北方牧业地带牲畜倍增
    新华社17日讯　我国北方东起大兴安岭西到帕米尔高原的广阔牧业地带，七年中牲畜增加了一倍多。
    根据最近统计，内蒙古、新疆、甘肃、青海等四个牧业比重较大的自治区和省，现有牲畜（不包括猪）已达七千四百多万头。牛、马等大牲畜比1949年增加将近一倍，羊增加了一点二倍。
    这四个自治区和省，经营畜牧业的主要是蒙古、藏、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔吉克、裕固等少数民族人民，以及农业区和半农半牧区的汉族农民。几年来，他们为国民经济其他部门和各族人民提供了大量的畜产品和耕畜、役畜。从1952年到1956年，国家在这四个省区收购的绵羊毛就有两亿五千多万斤。这些羊毛如果全部织成呢绒，可以缝制几千万套毛料衣服，如果全部出口，可以换回一百多万吨钢材。这些省区每年都以数万吨肉类供应全国各大城市和工矿区。去年11月间，我国向埃及出口的一千多吨冻肉也是从内蒙古草原运出的。内蒙古、甘肃、青海等地牧业区和半农半牧区，每年还以数万头精壮的耕牛、役用骡马支援东北、华北、西北等地农业生产。甘肃和新疆接近戈壁的地区，曾经输送出一万多峰骆驼支援西藏运输，在西藏各地公路修起以前，骆驼队曾经到达过喜马拉雅山麓。
    这几个地区畜牧业的发展，使当地各族人民，特别是少数民族牧民的生活得到了改善。青海部分地区的藏族牧民每年平均购买力，从1953年到1955年即提高了一倍多。随着畜牧业的发展，各牧区的文化事业也发展很快，青海的藏族、新疆的柯尔克孜、塔吉克等族的小学生在过去几年中增加了五倍到七倍。
    这些地区畜牧业的发展，主要是由于正确地执行民族政策，在牧区贯彻执行不斗不分、不划阶级，牧工、牧主两利，扶助贫苦牧民，组织工农牧业相互支援等一系列的政策和发展生产的措施。据初步统计，从1950年到1956年，国家发给这四个省区少数民族牧民的贷款达两亿多元。国家每年组织供应和直接调拨到四个省区牧区的粮食达数亿斤，每年还以大量茶、布、割草机、水车等生活资料和生产资料供应牧区。各族牧民和兼营牧业的农民，在国家的帮助下，辛勤地发展了畜牧业生产。
    广大牧区逐步成长起来的社会主义因素，对畜牧业的发展起着日益重要的作用。过去几年中，这四个省区建立了两百多座国营牧场，拥有大小牲畜一百多万头。各牧区根据牧民原有互助习惯，相当普遍地发展了互助组织，从去年起，内蒙古和新疆建立了一批畜牧业生产合作社，青海、甘肃也开始试办牧业社。到去年年底，这四个省区已经建立牧业社一千二百三十多个，其中内蒙古、新疆两自治区入社牧民都达到总牧户的20％以上。这些牧业社的牲畜净增殖率，绝大部分都比当地单干牧民的高。在这同时，有的牧区还根据牧主的要求，试办了一批公私合营牧场。
    这些国营牧场、畜牧业生产合作社和公私合营牧场在改进饲养管理、改良畜种、防治兽疫、组织多种经营和进行草地基本建设等方面，都起着良好的示范作用。
