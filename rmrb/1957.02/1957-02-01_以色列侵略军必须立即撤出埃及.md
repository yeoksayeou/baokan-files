Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 31st: According to the Egyptian "Al-Akhbar" newspaper, Gaza residents held a large-scale demonstration on the 23rd, demanding that Israeli troops withdraw from Egyptian territory. Israeli troops opened fire and killed 32 demonstrators, and detained 357 people in detention camps, where they were subjected to torture.

The "Al-Akhbar" newspaper on the 30th published a dispatch from its reporter in the Gaza region. Through extensive interviews with Gaza residents, the reporter also reported on other crimes committed by the Israeli army.

In Khan Yunis, Israeli troops destroyed all the houses of local residents. When residents went into the streets to see the atrocities committed by the Israelis, Israeli troops killed 29 residents and wounded 18. Israeli troops also inhumanly killed a mother and the child hiding behind her.

Israeli troops drove out patients from the Gaza hospital and killed three doctors. They prohibited Arabs from receiving medical treatment.

In Gaza, Rafah, and Khan Yunis, all schools were closed, leaving 18,000 students wandering the streets.

Israeli authorities also ordered the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to dismiss 700 employees and 1,000 workers in the region.

An Arab chieftain told the reporter that Israeli troops violently seized the seals of the chiefs of some Arab tribes and then stamped these seals on "petitions" demanding that Gaza be placed under Israeli rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 31st: Two thousand students from Cairo University signed a statement condemning the Western proposal to internationalize the Gaza and Aqaba Bay regions.

This statement was handed over to "Al-Gomhuria" by a student delegation on the 29th. The statement pointed out that the Western proposal is an extension of the new conspiracy called the Eisenhower Doctrine.

The statement declared that it would adhere to the firm position taken by the Egyptian government.

Resolution Passed by the Communist Party of Israel

Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: TASS, Tel Aviv, January 30th: According to "Kol HaAm," the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel said in its adopted resolution that the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from Sharm el-Sheikh and the Gaza Strip is the primary condition for creating prerequisites for resolving disputes between Israel and Arab countries.

The Central Committee warned that the reason for the Israeli army's delay in withdrawing from Egyptian territory is the collusion between the Israeli government and the governments of imperialist countries headed by the United States, and that this collusion results in Israel continuing to act as a tool of power politics and imperialist oppression against Egypt and other Arab countries.

The Central Committee also warned Israel not to participate in the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which aims to exert economic and political control over Middle Eastern countries by force.

Statement by the Acting Secretary-General of the Arab League

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 30th: Acting Secretary-General of the Arab League, Bela Rama, said on the 28th, "Israel must withdraw behind the old armistice lines. The Arab countries insist on this and will never agree to acts that undermine their territorial integrity."

Dr. Bela Rama made this statement when reporters asked him to comment on Israel's refusal to withdraw from Egyptian territory.

    以色列侵略军必须立即撤出埃及
    加沙居民举行大规模示威
    新华社开罗31日电　据埃及“消息报”报道，加沙居民23日曾举行大规模的示威游行，要求以色列部队撤出埃及领土。以色列部队开枪打死了32个示威群众，并且把三百五十七个人关进了拘留营，对他们进行了拷打。
    30日的“消息报”登载了它驻加沙地区的记者发来的这篇电讯。这个记者通过对加沙居民的广泛访问还报道了以色列军队的其他种种罪行。
    在汉纳阿莱，以色列军队破坏了当地居民所有的房屋，当居民走到街上来看以色列人的暴行的时候，以色列部队打死了居民二十九人，打伤了十八人。以色列部队还惨无人道地杀死了一位母亲和藏在她身后的孩子。
    以色列部队赶走了加沙医院内的病人，并且杀死了三位医生。他们不准阿拉伯人就医。
    在加沙，拉法和汉龙尼斯，所有的学校都被封闭了，使一万八千名学生踯躅街头。
    以色列当局还勒令联合国难民救济及就业局在这个地区内开除了七百名雇员和一千名工人。
    一位阿拉伯酋长告诉这位记者说，以色列部队用暴力夺走了阿拉伯一些部族的酋长的印信，然后把这些印信盖在要求把加沙置在以色列统治下的“请愿书”上。
    新华社开罗31日电　开罗大学的两千名学生签署了一个声明，谴责西方提出的要把加沙和亚喀巴湾地区国际化的建议。
    这份声明在29日由学生代表团交给“共和国报”。声明中指出，西方的建议是名为艾森豪威尔主义的新阴谋的扩大。
    声明宣布要坚持埃及政府所采取的坚决的立场。
    以色列共产党通过决议
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫30日讯：据“人民呼声报”报道，以色列共产党中央委员会全体会议在通过的决议中说，以色列军队完全地、无条件地从沙姆沙伊赫和加沙地区撤退是为解决以色列和阿拉伯国家纠纷问题创造前提的首要条件。
    中央委员会警告说，以色列军队所以迟迟不从埃及领土撤退，这是因为以色列政府同以美国为首的帝国主义国家政府有勾结，这种勾结的结果是以色列继续充当实力政策和帝国主义压迫埃及和其余阿拉伯国家的工具。
    中央委员会还警告说，以色列不要参预“艾森豪威尔主义”，这个主义的目的是用武力对中东国家实行经济上和政治上的统治。
    阿拉伯联盟代秘书长发表谈话
    新华社开罗30日电　阿拉伯联盟代理秘书长贝拉马28日说，“以色列必须撤退到旧停战线后面去。阿拉伯国家坚持这一点，并且决不会同意破坏它们领土完整的行为。”
    贝拉马博士是在记者要他就以色列拒绝撤离埃及领土的行为发表意见时说这番话的。
