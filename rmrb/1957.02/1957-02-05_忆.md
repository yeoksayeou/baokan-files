	Memory	
	In the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, when I think of the Spring Festival we spent with the masses in the revolutionary base areas, although it was not as enchanting as the Spring Festival of my childhood, it is a very precious memory compared to the situation after we entered the city.
	At that time, the organizations and troops all lived in the homes of the masses. When the Spring Festival came, the landlords were always busier than usual, grinding flour to steam steamed buns, and grinding soybeans to make tofu. We also helped them carry water and push the mill, cleaning the house from top to bottom, inside and out, so that it was bright and clean. In terms of the supply system, for such a big festival, we would add half a kilogram of meat. If the comrades in the unit's kitchen were a bit skilled, they would make a big deal out of it and cook a very rich dish. At the very least, there would be a large bowl of radish stewed with meat, and we would eat a meal of steamed buns or a meal of rice. The landlords' family was our honored guest. However, we often encountered particularly polite landlords who refused to come even after being invited three or four times. So we pulled them, dragged them, and even waited until we got angry before they would sit at the table. It was really warm.
	In addition to inviting the masses in the驻地 (zhùdì, stationed area) to eat, we sometimes organized evening parties and celebrations with the masses. Since the Party and government organizations did not have cultural troupes, the cadres themselves would play the erhu, flute, and do some singing and storytelling, and sometimes perform a short play. The content of the programs was mostly closely related to the current struggle tasks, and it did play a role in combining entertainment and propaganda education.
	During the New Year and Spring Festival, comrades also sometimes organized themselves to offer New Year greetings to leaders or other units. They would also beat gongs and drums, dress up, and offer New Year greetings to the masses in the 驻地 (zhùdì, stationed area). Gifts were also given to military dependents and families of martyrs in the 驻地 (zhùdì, stationed area).
	However, such peaceful years were not easy to come by. Sometimes, the Japanese and puppet troops in the strongholds would take advantage of the masses being busy with the New Year to launch a sudden attack or mopping-up operation, looting all the things that the masses had painstakingly prepared for the festival.
	I remember before the Spring Festival of 1947, the Kuomintang army carried out "encirclement and suppression" against our Sūzhōng (苏中)Liberated Area. Our group insisted on staying in a township near the coast, and soon lost contact with the organization. So we found a sea boat, crossed the strait to find the organization. The night we arrived on the other side of the coast was New Year's Eve. When we found a place to live through the village cadres and went to bed in the middle of the night, the cadres came to inform us: the enemy had arrived at a market town less than three miles away from our lodging. So, we moved again before dawn. On the first day of the New Year, there were gunshots everywhere, and we ran for a day with the masses.
	The days of battle finally passed, and we victoriously entered the city. Now the Spring Festival in the city naturally no longer has the enchanting details of my childhood Spring Festival, nor does it have the politically significant activities of our revolutionary base area era. I think this should make us think: in the old society, how many people were happy during the Spring Festival, and how many people were afraid of the lanterns moving in the dark night? We comrades who have fought in the revolutionary base areas, recalling a bowl of pork, a few steamed buns, and the scene of inviting the landlords to share the joy, that should not be without meaning, right?

    忆	蒲若鲁
    在抗日战争和解放战争中，想起我们在革命根据地里和群众一起过春节的情景，虽然没有童年时代的春节那样迷人，但和我们进入城市以后的情形比较起来，却是十分珍贵的记忆了。
    那时，机关和部队都是住在群众家里，逢到过春节，房东总也比平日忙碌一些，磨面蒸馒头啦，磨豆子做豆腐啦；我们呢，也就帮着他们抬水、推磨。把屋子从上到下、里里外外打扫得亮堂堂。在供给制度上，过这样的大节，我们要加一斤肉，如果单位的伙房同志有点本领的话，就会有文章做了，能够做出一次很丰富的菜来；最蹩脚的，也有一大钵萝卜烧肉，吃一顿馒头或是一顿大米饭。而房东一家，就是我们的上客。可是也常常碰到特别客气的房东，三请四邀还不肯来，于是我们就拉的拉、拖的拖，甚至还等到我们生气了才坐上桌来，真是热和得很。
    除了请驻地的群众吃饭以外，有时还组织晚会，和群众联欢。党政机关没有文工团，就由干部们自己来拉胡琴、吹笛子，说说唱唱，有时也演个小戏。节目的内容，大都是和当前的斗争任务密切结合的，确实也起了欢娱和宣传教育相结合的作用。
    过年、过春节，有时同志们也组织起来向首长或旁的单位去贺禧拜年，也敲锣打鼓、化了装去向驻地的群众拜年，对于驻地的军属和烈属，还要送礼。
    可是过这样的太平年，也不是容易的。有时候，据点里的日伪军会乘群众忙于过年而来突然的袭击或扫荡一下，把群众辛辛苦苦准备起来的过节东西，掳掠一空。
    记得1947年的春节前，国民党军对我苏中解放区进行“清剿”，我们一个小组坚持在一个靠近海滨的乡里，不久就和机关失去了联系，于是我们找了一只海船，渡过海峡去找机关，到达那边海岸的晚上，正是除夕。当我们通过村干部找好住处睡到半夜，干部就来通知我们：敌人已经到了离我们宿处不到三里路的一个市集上了，于是，我们天不亮就又转移。初一那天，四面是枪声，我们和群众一起，也就跑了一天。
    战斗的日子终于过去了，我们胜利地进入了城市。现在城市里的春节，自然不再有我那童年时代春节的那种迷人的细节，也没有我们革命根据地时代那样饶有政治意义的活动了。我以为，这正该让我们想一想：旧社会里的春节，到底有多少人是欢乐的，多少人是害怕那暗夜中游动着的灯笼的？我们曾经在革命根据地里战斗过来的同志，回忆一下一钵猪肉，几个馒头，邀请房东共乐的情景，那该不是没有意义的吧。
