White Clouds, Pearl Sea, Guangzhou City
Huang Xiangqing, Zhou Wei

A distant guest newly arrived in Guangzhou will find this largest city in southern China to be a beautiful one; especially in the winter days, if he has just come south from the frozen north, he will deepen his understanding and love of the vast, colorful motherland because he can find traces of spring here. If he is an old friend of this city, he will feel the great achievements of the motherland's construction from the changes in the city's appearance.

Yuexiu Park Becomes Even More Beautiful

In the northern suburbs of Guangzhou, there is a small hill, which is Yuexiu Mountain. Yuexiu Mountain is the southern vein of the famous Baiyun Mountain. Climbing to the top of the mountain, the entire city of Guangzhou is clearly visible, and the Pearl River, like a white ribbon, floats in front of you. Therefore, Yuexiu Mountain naturally becomes a good park in Guangzhou.

The highest point of Yuexiu Mountain is the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Tower, and slightly below is the famous Zhenhai Tower. The tower was built more than 570 years ago, and legend has it that it was built by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty to suppress the "imperial aura" here. Over the years, this tall building with red walls and green tiles has experienced countless pains. During the Opium War, the British imperialist artillery once damaged it; the Qing Dynasty once designated it as a restricted area; after the warlord Long Jiguang dined here, he returned directly to the Zhenshoushi (garrison commander) Office (now Tianping Street) through a specially built overpass to avoid people's attacks; before liberation, the Kuomintang army was stationed here, making it dilapidated. However, it is now the People's Museum, and inside it displays the most precious materials it has witnessed – the cultural relics of the revolutionary struggles of the people of Guangdong in the past century.

At the foot of Zhenhai Tower is the famous Yuexiu Mountain Stadium. In the era of Kuomintang rule, this was just a football field hastily built with the help of valleys, with dust flying when games were played, and spectators could only climb dangerous cliffs at the risk of slipping down the hillside to watch the games. However, after liberation, after the city's youth volunteered to open mountains and fill land and the people's government repaired it, it has now become a nationally famous stadium.

Going north from Zhenhai Tower are the swimming pool and Beixiu Lake.

Beixiu Lake covers an area of about 50 mu, with a lake pavilion and a winding long embankment, with willows hanging over the embankment. On holidays and after work, thousands of workers and students row boats, sketch, and fish here.

The above-mentioned places are collectively called Yuexiu Park. Now the entire park—or rather, the entire mountain—is planted with flowers and trees, and roads have been built, so that cars can directly reach the top of the mountain.

Former Cemetery Becomes International Road

Along Beixiu Lake, down the northern foot of Yuexiu Mountain, is Liuhua Bridge. Legend has it that there used to be a small river here, with a small bridge over the river. Zhao Tuo, the king of Nanyue during the Han Dynasty, once built a palace here, and the palace maids often sprinkled flowers down the river when they dressed up, hence the name Liuhua Bridge. However, as time passed, this place gradually became a cemetery and a burial ground, and the poetic legendary image completely disappeared. During the Kuomintang rule, this place became an execution ground, with heartbreaking execution bugles sounding from morning to night; and in the days of white terror, the gunshots that rang out from time to time in the deep night awakened the sleeping people. How many revolutionary martyrs, how many upright people, shed their blood here! Perhaps due to a similar-sounding mispronunciation, Liuhua Bridge slowly became known as Liuhua Bridge.

However, after liberation, the people rebuilt this place into a poetic place. You can no longer see those graves and withered grass. This area is already the famous "International Road." The wide road surface is paved with asphalt, and evergreen eucalyptus trees are planted along the road; the towering Sino-Soviet Friendship Building stands on the edge of Liuhua Bridge and Guihuagang; only the laughter and songs of tourists and Young Pioneers echo here. Gunshots and white bones have become a heavy memory for adults.

Parks Built on Rubble Fields

Going south along International Road, you will reach Jiefang Road. Turning from Jiefang Road to Taiping Road and then to Shaqi, you will reach Guangzhou Cultural Park. The Cultural Park has pavilions for aquatic products, agriculture, cultural relics, and crafts; there are theaters and tea houses. Thousands of people come here to play every day. At night, under the illumination of thousands of neon lights and electric lights, the sound of people's laughter spreads everywhere.

The former site of the Cultural Park was originally called "Thirteen Hongs." During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, when the sea ban was first opened, it was named after the thirteen business firms here designated by the Qing government to handle foreign business. From then on, this place became the vanguard base for imperialist aggression and the breeding ground for the comprador class. Opium was transported from here to poison the people. In 1842, the accumulated anger of the people broke out, and taking advantage of an incident in which "red-haired barbarians" stabbed a Chinese, they set fire to these business firms. However, the power of imperialism grew stronger and stronger, and the "Thirteen Hongs" were rebuilt. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the "Thirteen Hongs" even donated military funds to help the Qing government suppress the revolution.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the "Thirteen Hongs" were bombed into ruins. During the Liberation War, because this area was a prosperous area of valuable land, the Kuomintang's reactionary bureaucrats publicly auctioned it off. Later, because of uneven distribution of spoils and mutual competition, the auction did not succeed, and this place was still a field of rubble.

After liberation, the people built their own Cultural Park on this ruin that had suffered so much humiliation and shed so much blood.

Overseas Chinese New Village Is Beautiful and Peaceful

Leaving the Cultural Park and heading east along the Bund, passing the Haizhu Bridge, which was brutally destroyed by the Kuomintang army and quickly rebuilt by the people, and then going north and east around Yuzigang in the eastern suburbs, you will reach the Overseas Chinese New Village.

Many overseas Chinese were forced to leave their hometowns and go abroad due to poverty. Many people died quietly under hard labor; some accumulated some wealth after several twists and turns. When they were able to cope with life or when they reached old age, they always wanted to return to their roots and return to their motherland. But how did the old society at that time treat them? When overseas Chinese returned to China, from the first step they took in Guangzhou, from the pier to their hometown, they would be subjected to various forms of exploitation and deception, and even the transportation fee for their luggage had to be paid extra; when they returned to their hometowns, the extortion of local tyrants and bandits was even worse.

The newly built Overseas Chinese New Village specifically marks the place where this situation has been completely changed.

The Overseas Chinese New Village now has more than 50 buildings and a large-scale Overseas Chinese Primary School. More than 30 overseas Chinese families and more than 700 overseas Chinese children live and study here. It will also be expanded into a residential area with more than 500 buildings. The people's government has shown meticulous care for overseas Chinese, from allocating land, building, supplying materials, to supplying non-staple foods, all of which are given special consideration. Now, overseas Chinese no longer worry about being robbed and extorted when they return to their motherland, and they live a happy life here quietly.

Rivers and Mountains Remain the Same, but the Face is Completely New

Readers, people who love Guangzhou, leave the Overseas Chinese New Village and return to the top of Yuexiu Mountain and look around! To the east, you can see the Railway Workers' New Village, which has more than 100 new houses, inhabited by hundreds of families; you can see the Municipal Construction Workers' New Village, where more than 4,000 workers and their families live. Before liberation, they were the most despised workers who cleaned the city and swept away garbage!

To the south, that is Xiaogang. You can see a large area of houses in Xiaogang New Village, where more than 5,000 staff and workers from five units, including the Post and Telecommunications Bureau and the Maritime Transport Bureau, live. To the west, you will see the Electric Power Workers' New Village and the Water Plant Workers' New Village in the Xicun area. Tens of thousands of hydro-electric workers and their families live here, with beautiful bungalows and towering buildings.

During the day, in these new villages, in the nurseries, in the schools, they are all filled with people's happy laughter; and at night, when the electric lights illuminate these new villages transparently and brightly, joyful rays shine from every window!

But look back! Before liberation, this place was either a wild forest or a cemetery; either rat holes and snake nests, or places to discard dead babies and garbage. The rivers and mountains remain the same, but the face is completely new.

Guangzhou City! You once had the legend of five goats holding ears of rice, which made you happy. However, for thousands of years, you have been mired in pain. The five goats have not appeared. Only under the shining of the five-star red flag after liberation do you appear so solemn, beautiful, lovely, and charming.

Today, we climb Yuexiu, looking back at the past and looking at the present. The white clouds and pearl sea are no longer a feeling of vicissitudes, but the prosperity and development of the motherland, progressing rapidly! (Attached pictures)

    白云珠海广州城
    黄向青　周围
    一个新到广州来的远方客人，将会感到我国南部这个最大的城市是一个多么美丽的城市；特别是在冬天的日子里，如果他刚从万里冰封的北国南来，还将因为在这里能找到春天的踪影，加深对辽阔、多采的祖国的认识和热爱。如果他是这城市的故旧，他更将会从这个城市面貌的变化，感到祖国建设的伟大成就。
    越秀公园越发秀丽
    在广州市的北郊，有一座小小的山岗，它就是越秀山。越秀山是著名的白云山的南脉。登上山头，广州全市便历历在目，珠江像一条白练似的，在眼前飘荡。因此，越秀山便天然地成为广州市的一个良好的公园。
    越秀山的最高处是中山纪念塔，稍下来一些就是有名的镇海楼。楼建于五百七十多年前，相传是明帝朱元璋为了镇压这里的“皇气”而建的。多少年来，这座红墙碧瓦的高楼曾经经历了无数的痛苦。鸦片战争的时候，英帝国主义的炮火曾经轰坏过它；清代曾把它划为禁区；军阀龙济光在这里饮宴之后，为了避免人民的袭击，从这里通过一条特建的天桥直回镇守使行署（在今的天平街）；解放前国民党军曾在这里屯驻，弄得它破烂不堪。可是，它现在已经是人民的博物馆了，里面陈设着它所目睹的最珍贵的材料——广东人民近百年来的革命斗争的文物。
    镇海楼的脚下，便是有名的越秀山体育场。在国民党统治时代，这里不过是一个借着山谷草草建成的足球场，赛起球来，尘土飞扬，观众也只能冒着滑落山坡的危险攀登危崖观战。可是，解放后，它经过全市青年义务劳动开山填土和人民政府的修建之后，现在已经成为一个全国著名的运动场了。
    从镇海楼北下，便是游泳池和北秀湖了。
    北秀湖面积约有五十亩，有湖心亭，有蜿蜒的长堤，堤上飘垂着杨柳。假日和工余，成千的工人、学生在这里划船、写生、垂钓。
    上面这许多地方统称为越秀公园，现在环园——也可以说环山，都种满花木，辟有公路，汽车可直达山顶。
    昔日乱葬岗今日国际路
    沿北秀湖，下越秀山的北麓，便是流化桥了。相传这里从前有小河，河上有小桥。汉南越王赵佗，曾筑宫于此，宫女梳妆时，常撒花顺水流下，故名流花桥。但是，时过境迁，这里逐渐变成一片墓地和乱葬岗，那种诗意的传说形象完全消失净尽。国民党统治的时候，这里变成了刑场，从早到晚响着裂人心魄的行刑军号；而在白色恐怖的日子，深宵夜静，不时响着的枪声，把沉睡的人们惊醒。多少革命烈士，多少正直的人，在这里洒下了热血！也许是声音近似的讹传，流花桥慢慢叫成流化桥了。
    可是，解放以后，人民重新把这里建筑成了诗样的地方。那些坟墓和衰草，你再也看不到了。这一带已经是有名的“国际路”。铺着柏油的宽阔路面，路旁植着常绿的“油加利”树；巍峨的中苏友好大厦，矗立在流化桥边、桂花岗畔；这里响着的只有游览者和少先队员们的笑声和歌声。枪声和白骨已经成为成年人的沉重记忆了。
    瓦砾场上修起公园
    循国际路南行，便到达解放路。从解放路绕出太平路南行，转入沙基，你便到达广州文化公园。文化公园里面有水产、农业、文物、工艺等馆；有剧场、有茶座。这里每天都有上万的人来游玩。晚上，在千百盏霓虹灯、电灯的照耀下，人们欢笑的声音到处飘扬。
    文化公园的前址原名“十三行”，清乾隆年间，海禁初开的时候，因清政府指定这里的十三家商行处理外商业务而得名。从此以后，这里便成为帝国主义侵略的先头据点，成为买办阶级的温床。鸦片烟从这里运出去毒害人民。1842年，人民积聚的愤怒爆发了，借着一次“红毛黑夷”刺伤中国人的事件，纵火焚烧了这些商行。可是帝国主义的势力愈来愈大，“十三行”又重建起来，太平天国的时候，“十三行”还捐过军饷帮助清政府扑灭革命。
    抗日战争时，“十三行”被轰炸成为一片废墟。解放战争时，因这里是寸金之地的繁盛区域，国民党的反动官僚，曾把它公开拍卖。后来因为分赃不匀，互相争夺，拍卖才没有成功，这里依然是一片瓦砾之场。
    解放后，人民就是在这所蒙受过多少耻辱，流过多少鲜血的废墟上，建成了自己的文化公园。
    华侨新村美丽安宁
    出了文化公园，沿着长堤东行，经过国民党军残酷炸毁而又为人民迅速修建起来的海珠桥，再从北向东绕出东郊玉子岗。你便到达华侨新村了。
    许多华侨，过去都是迫于贫困而离乡别井向国外流亡的。有许多人在苦役之下，悄然死去；有些人几经磨折，才积得一点资财。当他们稍能对付生活，或是到晚年的时候，总是落叶归根想回到祖国来。可是那时的旧社会是怎样对待他们呢？侨胞回国，从踏上广州的第一步起，由码头直到回乡，都会受到种种压榨和欺骗，连行李的运输费也得额外多付；回到乡里，土豪盗匪的勒索更不在话下了。
    新建的华侨新村就是具体地标志这种状况已经彻底改变了的地方。
    华侨新村，现在已建有五十多幢楼房，还有一所规模宏大的华侨小学。有三十多户侨胞和七百多个华侨子弟，在这里居住和学习。这里还将扩展成为五百多幢楼房的住宅区。人民政府对华侨表现了无微不至的关心，从拨地、建筑、供给材料直到副食品的供应，都有特殊的照顾。现在，侨胞们回到祖国再也不愁被抢劫和勒索了，他们在这里安静地过着幸福的生活。
    河山依旧面目全新
    读者们，热爱广州的人们，出了华侨新村，你再回到越秀山巅，纵目四望吧！往东，你可以看到铁路工人新村，这里有一百多幢新房子，住着几百户人家；你可以看到市政建设工人新村，这里住着四千多个工人和他们的家属，解放前，他们是最被瞧不起的清洁城市、打扫垃圾的工人啊！
    往南，那是小港，你可以看到小港新村的一大片房子，这里住着邮电局、海运局等五个单位的五千多个职员和工人。往西，你将看到西村区域的电业工人新村和水厂工人新村。这里居住着成千上万的水电工人和他们的家属，有美丽的平房，也有耸立的楼房。
    白天，在这些新村里面，在托儿所里，在学校里，都充满着人们幸福的欢笑；而晚上当电灯把这些新村照得透明雪亮的时候，从每一家窗户里都闪射着欢乐的光辉啊！
    但是，回顾一下吧！在解放前，这里不是野林，就是墓地；不是鼠洞蛇窝，就是抛弃死婴和垃圾之地。河山依旧，然而，面目已经全新了。
    广州城啊！在你身上曾经有过五羊含穗，因而使你变得幸福的传说。可是，几千年来，你一直沉沦在痛苦里面，五羊并没有出现，只有在解放后的五星红旗照耀下，你才显得那样庄严、美丽、可爱、多娇。
    今天，我们登临越秀，抚今追昔，白云珠海，它再不是沧桑之感，而是祖国的昌盛繁荣，一日千里了！（附图片）
