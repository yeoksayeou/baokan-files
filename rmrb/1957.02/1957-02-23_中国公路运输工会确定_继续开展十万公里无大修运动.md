Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: The Eighth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the National Committee of the Chinese Highway Transport Trade Union, recently held in Beijing, decided to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee for increasing production and practicing economy, to continue the advanced producer movement, and to guide the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Overhaul Movement" and the socialist competition of the entire industry towards a deeper and wider mass movement. The meeting also summarized the achievements and experiences of the past year.

The meeting pointed out that, due to the active participation of highway transport workers in socialist competition last year, and the implementation of many effective advanced experiences, the transportation plan was overfulfilled despite the tight automobile transportation tasks. In 1956, the volume of passenger and freight traffic and the turnover volume of automobiles both exceeded the levels stipulated for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan. Highway construction, surveying and design, and highway maintenance workers have also made significant achievements.

The achievements of the past year show that vigorously carrying out the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Overhaul" movement in automobile transportation is an effective method for automobile transport workers to increase production and practice economy. Taking the automobile overhaul mileage as an example, calculated according to Beijing medium-sized automobiles, one automobile reaching 100,000 kilometers without overhaul can save 4,014.5 yuan in major and medium repair costs; due to the automobile not undergoing major repairs, it can also increase the transportation volume by 8,398.18 ton-kilometers. At present, 2,776 automobiles nationwide have exceeded 100,000 kilometers without overhaul. After research and discussion, the meeting determined that it is necessary to continue to deeply carry out the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Overhaul Movement" and the socialist competition of the entire industry, in order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's tasks of increasing production and practicing economy.

    中国公路运输工会确定
    继续开展十万公里无大修运动
    据新华社21日讯　最近在北京召开的中国公路运输工会全国委员会第八次全体委员扩大会议，确定响应党中央增产节约的号召，继续开展先进生产者运动，把“安全、节约、十万公里无大修运动”和全产业社会主义竞赛，导向更深入更广泛的群众性运动。会议还总结了过去一年的成就和经验。
    会议指出，由于公路运输业职工去年积极参加了社会主义竞赛，并且推行了许多行之有效的先进经验，在汽车运输任务紧张的情况下，超额完成了运输计划。1956年汽车的客货运量和周转量，都超过了第一个五年计划规定的1957年的水平。公路建筑、勘测设计和公路养护职工，也都做出了显著成就。
    一年来的成就说明，在汽车运输方面大力开展“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”运动，是汽车运输职工增产节约的有效方法。只是以汽车大修里程一项为例，按照北京中型汽车计算，一辆汽车达到十万公里无大修，就能节约大、中修费用四千零一十四元五角；由于汽车不大修还可以增加运输量八千三百九十八点一八吨公里。目前全国已经有二千七百七十六辆汽车超过十万公里无大修。会议经过研究讨论，确定今后必须继续深入开展“安全、节约、十万公里无大修运动”和全产业社会主义竞赛，以便保证完成和超额完成今年的增产节约任务。
