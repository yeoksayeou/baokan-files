Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 14th. German Communist Party First Secretary Lehmann gave a talk on Berlin German Radio on the 12th regarding Bulganin's letter to Adenauer. Lehmann pointed out: The significance of Bulganin's letter far exceeds the scope of general diplomatic steps. It was written out of concern for the development of the situation in West Germany, a development which has placed West German residents in serious danger of war.

Lehmann said that the attitude which people in the Bonn government were forced to express after the publication of this letter demonstrates the confusion in Bonn and also shows Bonn's intention to continue its past erroneous path. This attitude is contrary to the wishes of broad sections of West German residents. Lehmann said that among West German residents, the desire to strengthen relations with the Soviet Union on the basis of signing trade agreements has become increasingly strong. Lehmann finally said that the majority of West German residents agree with us that the Adenauer government and the political leadership of the Adenauer party in West Germany must be removed, and that for the sake of peace and security, West Germany must withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, abolish foreign military bases, abolish the conscription law and all measures of re-militarization; it is necessary to restore and expand democratic rights and freedoms in West Germany, including restoring the legal existence of the German Communist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, February 14th. According to TASS, Bonn: West German newspapers on the 13th published an interview given by Adenauer to a reporter from the British "News Chronicle". Adenauer said: A positive answer will be given to some of the issues involved in Bulganin's letter; while a negative answer will be given to other issues. The latter mainly refers to the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and Western countries.

Adenauer refused to recognize the German Democratic Republic, insisting that there is only one German state. Adenauer expressed welcome for the "very friendly tone" in Bulganin's letter.

According to the West German "Die Welt": Political observers believe that not all of Bulganin's proposals will be rejected, especially those concerning the expansion of trade between the two countries.

    雷曼认为布尔加宁的信意义重大
    西德人民希望促进对苏关系
    阿登纳表示对苏联建议有同意处也有不同意处
    新华社柏林14日电　德国共产党第一书记雷曼12日在柏林德意志广播电台就布尔加宁致阿登纳的信发表谈话。雷曼指出：布尔加宁的信的意义远远超过一般外交步骤的范围。它是出于对西德局势发展的忧虑而写的，而西德的发展已经使西德居民面临着严重的战争危险。
    雷曼说，这封信公布以后，波恩政府人士被迫表示的态度说明了波恩的混乱，同时也表明了波恩要继续进行过去的错误路线的意图。而这种态度是违反西德广大阶层的居民的愿望的。雷曼说，在西德居民中，要求在签订贸易协定的基础上加强同苏联的关系的愿望已日益强烈。雷曼最后说，西德的大多数居民和我们一致确认：必须取消阿登纳政府和阿登纳党在西德的政治领导，并且为了和平和安全，要求西德退出北大西洋战争公约，取消外国军事基地，取消征兵法和所有重新军事化的措施；需要在西德恢复和扩大民主权利和自由，包括恢复德国共产党的合法存在在内。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社波恩讯：西德报纸13日登载了阿登纳对英国“新闻纪事报”记者所发表的谈话。阿登纳说：对于布尔加宁的信里所涉及的某些问题，将给以肯定的答复；而对另外一些问题，将给以否定的答复。后者主要是指德意志联邦共和国同西方国家的关系问题而言。
    阿登纳不肯承认德意志民主共和国，硬说现在只存在着一个德意志国家。阿登纳表示欢迎布尔加宁信里的“十分友好的语气”。
    据西德“世界报”报道：政治观察家认为，布尔加宁的各项建议是不会全部被拒绝的，尤其是有关扩大两国贸易的建议。
