    Prescription (Fable)
  　Wu Yan
    Once upon a time, there was a doctor who, though not always able to cure every patient, saw many gradually recover after taking his prescriptions.

    One day, the doctor himself fell ill. He took his own pulse and carefully wrote out a prescription.

    The next day, his condition not only failed to improve but worsened. He took his own pulse again, examined his tongue in the mirror, and carefully wrote out another prescription.

    On the third day, his condition was critical, but he struggled to write an even more careful prescription.

    By the fourth day, he was too weak to move or write any more prescriptions.

    Those he had treated were greatly surprised, some even thinking he was a quack and doubting the effectiveness of his prescriptions.

    Frankly, such doubts were unfair. His prescriptions were generally correct, but there was a difference: others took the medicine he prescribed and gradually recovered, while he only wrote prescriptions and didn't take the medicine himself. In his own words:

    "Medicine is about intention. As long as the intention is there, that's enough!"

    Alas! Alas! It's unfortunate – not that the doctor died, but that some comrades among us treat self-criticism in the same way, only writing prescriptions but not taking the medicine. Just the day before yesterday, I heard such an argument:

    "Why bring up my shortcomings again? Didn't I make a self-criticism about it three months ago?"

    药方（寓言）
  　吴岩
    从前有个医生，凡是请他看病的，虽然不见得药到病除，但吃了几剂药以后，逐渐康复起来的，也还不在少数。
    有一天，医生本人病了，他给自己诊了诊脉，仔细地开了个药方。
    第二天，病势不但未曾好转，而且越发沉重了。他又给自己诊了诊脉，从镜子里看了看舌苔，又仔细地开了个药方。
    第三天，病势危笃，但他还是挣扎着更仔细地开了个药方。
    到了第四天，他已经无力动弹，也无法再开药方了。
    于是请他看过病的人都十分惊异，有的甚至以为他不过是个庸医，怀疑他开的药方也是完全要不得的了。
    说实在话，这种怀疑是不公平的。他开的药方大体上也还是正确的，只是这里有个区别：别人拿了他开的药方，总是配了药吃到肚子里，疾病因而也就渐渐的痊愈了；而他自己却是只开药方不吃药的，用他自己的话来说，那就是：
    “医者，意也。只要意思到了，也就是了！”
    咳！咳！真是不幸——不是那位医生不幸死了，不幸的是我们之中也还有个别的同志在对待自我批评上，也是只开药方不吃药的。就在前天吧，我还听到了这样的论调：
    “还提我这个缺点干什么呢？不是我在三个月前就为它做过检讨了吗？”
