Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: Kishi Nobusuke, the acting prime minister and foreign minister of the Ishibashi cabinet, which resigned on the 23rd, was elected as the new Japanese prime minister today with a majority vote in the Diet. Socialist Party's nominee for prime minister, Suzuki Mosaburo, was defeated.

Kishi Nobusuke immediately formed a new cabinet, and was sworn in this afternoon. Former Liberal Party Secretary-General, Ishii Mitsujiro, joined the new cabinet as Minister without Portfolio. Apart from this, the new cabinet consists entirely of the former Ishibashi cabinet members.

After the first cabinet meeting, Kishi Nobusuke announced at a press conference that the new cabinet would take the realization of the will and policies of the former Ishibashi cabinet as its first-stage task, and would not put forward any new policies of its own. He said that the first task of the new cabinet is to get the Diet to approve the 1957 budget proposed by the Ishibashi cabinet.

In answering reporters' questions, Kishi Nobusuke denied that he had any differences with former Prime Minister Ishibashi Tanzan on the issues of trade and diplomatic relations with China. He said that at the current stage, it is necessary to increase trade with China as much as possible and relax restrictions. However, it is not yet the stage to consider immediately restoring diplomatic relations or recognizing China.

Kishi Nobusuke stated that he does not intend to dissolve the Diet immediately.

Yesterday, Nosaka Sanzo, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement saying that the ostensible reason for the Ishibashi cabinet's resignation was the Prime Minister's illness, but there were deeper reasons. He said that the Ishibashi cabinet had to resign because of the Japanese people's opposition to the US's "aggression and war" policy, the contradictions and wavering within the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party, and the differing opinions of the monopoly capitalists.

    岸信介当选日本首相
    新阁仍是石桥内阁旧班底并且不另提新政策
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：23日辞职的石桥内阁的临时代理首相、外务相岸信介今天以多数票在国会当选为日本新首相。社会党提名的首相候选人铃木茂三郎落选。
    岸信介立即组成了新内阁，并且在今天下午宣誓就职。前自由党总务会长石井光次郎参加新内阁担任无任所相。除此之外，新内阁原封不动地由前石桥内阁的全部阁员组成。
    岸信介在结束第一次内阁会议后，在记者招待会上宣布，新内阁将把实现前石桥内阁的意志和政策作为它的第一阶段的任务，不另提出自己的政策。他说，新内阁的第一个任务是使国会批准石桥内阁提出的1957年度预算案。
    岸信介在答复记者的问题时，否认他在对中国的贸易和邦交问题的看法上曾经同前首相石桥湛山有分歧。他说，在目前阶段，有必要尽可能增加对中国的贸易，放宽限制。不过，目前还不是考虑立刻恢复外交关系或者承认中国的阶段。
    岸信介表示，他不打算立即解散国会。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三昨天发表谈话说，石桥内阁的总辞职表面上的理由是首相患病，但是还有更深刻的原因。他说，由于日本人民反对美国的“侵略和战争”政策、日本政府和自由民主党内部的矛盾和动摇以及垄断资本家的意见不一致等等原因，使石桥内阁不得不实行总辞职。
