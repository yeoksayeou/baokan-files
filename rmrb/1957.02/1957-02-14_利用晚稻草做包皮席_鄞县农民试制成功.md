    Using Late Rice Straw to Make Packaging Mats
    Successful Trial Production by Farmers in Yin County

    (Our newspaper reports) The Gulin Straw Mat Purchasing Station in Yin County, Zhejiang Province, successfully proposed using late rice straw to make packaging mats.

    Weaving straw mats is a major household sideline for farmers in western Yin County. Currently, due to a shortage of straw mat raw materials, the processing of some straw mats has been greatly affected. Packaging mats, which account for 6% of the straw mat sales volume, were previously woven with sedge. These straw mats could not be used as mats again after packaging, resulting in the loss and waste of raw materials. Using rice straw to modify packaging mats, the rice straw raw material is abundant and suitable for packaging and transportation requirements, and the cost is also lower, only 45 cents per piece.

    利用晚稻草做包皮席
    鄞县农民试制成功
    本报讯　浙江鄞县古林草席采购站倡议用晚稻草做包皮席成功。
    编织草席是鄞西农民主要的家庭副业，当前，由于草席原料不足，部分草席加工受到很大的影响。占草席运销数量6％的包皮席，过去都是用席草编织的，这种草席包装后不能再当席子使用，这就造成了原料的损耗和浪费。利用稻草改制包皮席，稻草原料充足，又适合包扎和运输的要求，成本也较低，每条只需四角五分。　（蒋明炎）
