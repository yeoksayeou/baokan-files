Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 24th: Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill yesterday successfully trial-produced over 500 pounds of 21.5 count special industrial yarn using recently test-planted improved Xinjiang cotton. This yarn can be used to weave cord fabric for airplane tires. The strength and various indicators of this batch of yarn all met the prescribed standards, and the strength surpassed that of yarn spun from the best Sudanese cotton and Egyptian cotton.

According to regulations, the strand strength (one strand is eighty turns of 120 yards of yarn) of 21.5 count special cotton yarn for weaving airplane tire cord fabric should be 160 pounds. The strand strength of this type of yarn normally spun by State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill using Egyptian cotton is around 163 pounds, while the strength of the yarn spun this time using Xinjiang cotton reached 170 pounds.

The method used by State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill to trial-spin this batch of Xinjiang cotton was exactly the same as that used for imported Egyptian cotton, including the combing process. In November of last year, Shanghai State-owned No. 7 Cotton Mill had also used the same Xinjiang cotton on ordinary cotton spinning machines without combing equipment to trial-spin another type of 21.5 count cotton yarn, which was woven into cord fabric for making heavy-duty truck tires. The strength and other indicators of the fabric also exceeded the standards.

    上海用新疆改良棉纺出特种工业用纱
    据新华社上海24日电　上海国棉二厂昨天试验出最近用新疆改良棉试纺的五百多磅二十一点五支特种工业用纱，可以用来织制飞机轮胎用的帘子布。这批纱的强力和各种指标都达到规定的标准，强力胜过用最好的苏丹棉和埃及棉纺的。
    按照规定，织制飞机轮胎帘子布用的二十一点五支特种棉纱的缕纱（用一百二十码纱绕八十圈为一缕）强力应为一百六十磅，而国棉二厂通常用埃及棉纺的这种纱的缕纱强力是一百六十三磅上下，这次用新疆棉纺的强力达到一百七十磅。
    国棉二厂试纺这批新疆棉的方法，同使用进口埃及棉完全一样，经过精梳过程。去年11月，上海国棉七厂曾经用同样的新疆棉在普通没有精梳设备的棉纺机上试纺过另一种二十一点五支棉纱，织成制造载重汽车轮胎用的帘子布，布的强力等指标也都超过标准。
