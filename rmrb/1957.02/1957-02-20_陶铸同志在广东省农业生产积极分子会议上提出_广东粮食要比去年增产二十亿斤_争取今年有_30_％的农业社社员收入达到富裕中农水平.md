Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 19th: To actively strive for a bumper agricultural harvest in Guangdong Province this year, to strive for increased production in 90% of the province's agricultural cooperatives and increased income for 90% of the agricultural cooperative members, and to strive for 30% of the agricultural cooperative members' average income to reach the level of local prosperous middle peasants. This is the call made by Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of Guangdong Province, at the Provincial Agricultural Production Activists Meeting on the 16th.

Tao Zhu said that this year's grain output in Guangdong Province is required to reach 26 billion jin, an increase of 2 billion jin compared to last year. Cash crops such as sugarcane, peanuts, and jute, as well as tropical crops and sericulture, should be actively developed as much as possible, and fruit production should also be appropriately developed. In the development of animal husbandry, the province is required to raise a cumulative total of 15 million pigs, an increase of 3 million compared to last year. Aquatic production should increase from 520,000 tons last year to more than 600,000 tons. Other areas such as forestry and rural sideline occupations should also be greatly developed.

Tao Zhu analyzed the favorable conditions for striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest throughout the province this year. He pointed out that this year, the province has basically achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization and has the foundation of increased production from last year, which allows for concentrating efforts on leading the development of production. Cadres at all levels and agricultural cooperatives also have a year's experience in leading production and cooperativization, and most cooperatives have a certain amount of assets. This year, the policy of comprehensive development of production is being implemented, and leading bodies at all levels will also transfer a large number of cadres to the countryside to strengthen the work in rural areas. These are all very favorable conditions. However, there are also some difficulties. For example, due to the low production level of agricultural cooperatives and shortcomings in management, coupled with natural disasters, about 15% of the agricultural cooperative members in the province saw a decrease in income last year. These difficulties must be overcome through hard work. He demanded that various measures to increase production be conscientiously implemented in production work, that the achievements and experiences of last year's work be correctly understood and summarized, and that banners and models be established, thereby launching a mass production movement throughout the province.

The Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Production Activists Meeting opened on the 16th. About 1,000 agricultural production activists and agricultural cadres are participating in the meeting, including agricultural, water conservancy, forestry, and fishery production activists from all over the province, as well as experts in animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, and tropical crop cultivation.

    陶铸同志在广东省农业生产积极分子会议上提出
    广东粮食要比去年增产二十亿斤
    争取今年有30％的农业社社员收入达到富裕中农水平
    新华社广州19日电　积极争取今年广东省农业大丰收，争取全省90％的农业社增产和90％的农业社社员增加收入，并且争取有30％的农业社社员平均收入达到当地富裕中农的水平。这是中共广东省委第一书记、广东省省长陶铸16日在全省农业生产积极分子会议上提出的号召。
    陶铸说，今年广东省粮食产量要求达到二百六十亿斤，比去年增产二十亿斤。甘蔗、花生、黄麻等经济作物和热带作物以及蚕桑都要根据可能去积极发展，水果也要适当发展。在发展畜牧业生产中，要求全省养猪累计达到一千五百万头，比去年增加三百万头。水产生产要由去年的五十二万吨增加到六十多万吨。其他如林业和农村副业等都要大大发展。
    陶铸分析了争取今年全省全面大丰收的有利条件。他指出：今年全省已经基本实现高级农业合作化，又有去年的增产基础，可以集中力量去领导发展生产；而各级干部和农业社还有了一年的领导生产和合作化的经验，一般社里都有一定的家底。今年又贯彻全面发展生产的方针，各级领导机关还将抽调大批干部下乡加强农村工作的力量，这些都是很有利的条件。但是也有一些困难，例如去年因为农业社的生产水平较低和经营管理工作的缺点，加上自然灾害等原因，全省约有15％的农业社社员减少收入。对这些困难必须努力加以克服。他要求认真把各项增产措施贯彻到生产工作中去，要正确认识和总结去年的工作成绩经验，树立旗帜榜样，从而在全省掀起一个群众性的大生产运动。
    广东省农业生产积极分子会议是在16日开幕的。参加会议的农业生产积极分子和农业干部共约有一千人，其中包括有来自全省各地的农业、水利、林业、渔业等方面的生产积极分子，有畜牧、兽医和栽培热带作物的能手。
