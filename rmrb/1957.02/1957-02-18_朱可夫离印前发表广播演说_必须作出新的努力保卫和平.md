Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 17th: Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal of the Soviet Union G.K. Zhukov, left Delhi today to return to his country after a visit to India at the invitation of the Indian government.

Zhukov arrived in New Delhi on January 24th. During this period, he also paid a five-day visit to Burma at the invitation of the Burmese government.

Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: TASS, Delhi, February 16th: Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Zhukov said in a radio address broadcast by All India Radio on February 16th that current international events show that forces wishing to launch a new war still exist and are actively operating.

He said that in the modern era, such a war would inevitably involve all countries, including India. Therefore, it is entirely understandable that the Indian people and their government are eager to defend world peace. The outstanding role played by Indian Prime Minister Mr. Nehru in the struggle for peace has earned the respect of all honest people.

Zhukov said that everyone knows that the Soviet people do not want war. The Soviet people are engaged in peaceful labor.

Some people in the West are saying that the Soviet Union advocates defending peace because it is weak. I do not want to argue with these gentlemen, but I would like to say to Indian friends that the Soviet Union is not afraid of any threats and can give a proper response to any blow. The Soviet government believes that its responsibility is to make every necessary effort to prevent a new war. The current international situation shows that all peace-loving countries and peoples must make new efforts to prevent war and defend the cause of peace.

Zhukov continued, "I believe that as long as India, the Soviet Union, China, the People's Democratic countries, and other peace-loving countries and peoples consistently and unremittingly devote all their efforts to the struggle for peace, they will be able to stop the conspiracies of the imperialist blocs that pursue aggressive foreign policies."

Speaking about his meetings with Indian military personnel, Zhukov said that the Indian army is capable of defending its homeland.

    朱可夫离印前发表广播演说
    必须作出新的努力保卫和平
    新华社新德里17日电　苏联国防部长、苏联元帅朱可夫应印度政府的邀请在印度进行访问之后，今天离开德里回国。
    朱可夫是在1月24日到达新德里的。在这期间，他还应缅甸政府的邀请在缅甸进行了五天的访问。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社德里16日讯：苏联国防部长朱可夫元帅16日在全印广播电台发表的广播演说中说，当前的国际事件说明，那些希望发动新战争的势力还存在着，而且正在积极活动。　　他说，在现代，这种战争是不可避免地会牵涉到所有国家的，其中包括印度在内。因而，印度人民和他们的政府热切地希望保卫世界和平，这是完全可以理解的。印度总理尼赫鲁先生在争取和平的斗争中所起的卓越作用引起了一切正直的人的尊重。
    朱可夫说，大家知道，苏联人民是不希望战争的。苏联人民正在从事和平劳动。
    西方有人在说，苏联主张保卫和平是因为苏联软弱。我不想同这些先生进行争论，但是，我想对印度朋友说，苏联并不怕任何威胁，它能对任何打击给予应有的回答。苏联政府认为自己的责任是竭尽一切必要的努力来防止新的战争。当前的国际局势说明，一切爱好和平的国家和人民必须作出新的努力，以防止战争，保卫和平事业。
    朱可夫接着说，我相信，只要印度、苏联、中国、人民民主国家和其他爱好和平的国家和人民，始终不懈地全力进行争取和平的斗争，他们就能阻止执行侵略性外交政策的帝国主义集团的阴谋活动。
    朱可夫在谈到同印度军人的会见时表示，印度军队有能力保卫自己的祖国。
