Xinhua News Agency, February 21st, New York dispatch: New York's "Worker Daily" published on the 14th the "Resolution on the Economic Situation in the United States" adopted by the 16th National Congress of the American Communist Party, which presented the American Communist Party's assessment and analysis of the American economic situation in the decade or so after the war.

The resolution stated that since 1939, the American economy has experienced tremendous development. American productivity has more than doubled. Today, the United States surpasses the sum of all other capitalist countries in terms of productivity and wealth. This enormous power, monopolized by a small group of large corporations, relies on extracting tribute from the entire capitalist world through the extensive expansion of foreign investment. It depends on two world wars and the extensive militarization of the American economy. It is the power of American imperialism, which is more greedy and parasitic than ever before. During these years, periods of relative prosperity have lengthened—nearly two decades without a major economic crisis.

Since 1947, despite temporary recessions in the American economy, industrial production has still increased by 42%. Corporate pre-tax profits have nearly doubled. Real wages in organized industry, especially in recent years, have increased significantly. By mid-1956, employment had reached a record-breaking level of 66.5 million people.

The resolution pointed out that the current boom has once again caused the illusion of permanent prosperity. Spokespersons for large corporations and the Eisenhower administration say that crises are a thing of the past. They also say that we have developed a "people's capitalism," in which the share of income and wealth received by the working people will gradually increase, while the share received by large corporations will decrease.

The resolution said that this illusion created by Wall Street is completely unfounded. In fact, the very factors that stimulate the boom also contribute to latent economic instability and imbalances between productivity and markets. Prominent among these factors are:

(1) Investment in fixed capital has remained consistently high throughout the post-war period. This is mainly due to the need to restore war-related losses worldwide and to meet domestic shortages through technological advancements, expanding basic industrial capacity to accommodate the expanded role of American monopoly capital in the world and military programs, and updating obsolete equipment. At the same time, the market for durable consumer goods has expanded, and the residential construction industry has experienced a long-term boom.

However, the rate of growth of industrial capacity today far exceeds the rate of growth of purchasing power. This disparity will eventually reach a point where continuous expansion despite insufficient markets will no longer be profitable, and capital investment will decrease.

(2) Government spending has increased significantly. For the current fiscal year, total spending by all levels of government will reach $100 billion, of which the federal government accounts for approximately $69 billion.

About two-thirds of federal spending is for national "security." Therefore, to a large extent, the high level of the daily economy is supported by unreliable arms spending. One of the consequences of this spending is that post-war inflation has pushed consumer prices and the cost of living to the highest levels in history; the federal debt is $276 billion, only slightly below the peak during World War II, with interest reaching billions of dollars; the tax burden consumes one-third of the income of the average worker.

(3) Private credit has expanded unprecedentedly. Corporate debt has increased by half since 1945. Personal debt—mortgages and consumer debt—has increased to $137 billion, of which more than $100 billion has been accumulated in the past decade. Consumer credit alone has increased to nearly $41 billion, equal to 15% of consumers' total disposable income, an unprecedentedly high proportion.

The resolution said that since 1954, the economic boom has been mainly due to this credit expansion, and large tax deductions and gifts to large corporations. Therefore, the American economy today presents a typical picture of a peacetime speculative boom, reminiscent in many ways of the boom of the 1920s. The ever-increasing amount of credit and the threat of further expansion that follows greatly contributes to latent economic instability.

(4) Post-war foreign investment has increased. Today, the total of various forms of American investment abroad is $45 billion, four times pre-war investment, and the profits taken back (both openly and covertly) are estimated at nearly $10 billion annually. In the main industrial sectors of the United States, the ratio of profits from foreign investment to total profits ranges from 10% to as high as 50% for oil trusts. These investments and profits exceed the sum of the investments and profits of all other imperialist countries (in addition to the billions of dollars in excess profits obtained from the excessive exploitation of black people in our country).

The resolution said that the increasing collapse of the colonial system and the growing national liberation movement make these foreign investment foundations very unstable, threatening the entire parasitic structure built on imperialist exploitation.

Obviously, the characteristics mentioned above make the economic future far less secure than some would have us believe.

The resolution also said that the current boom in the American economy has not brought prosperity to everyone. From 1947 to mid-1956, agricultural income decreased by one-third. The Department of Agriculture reported that in 1955, net agricultural income was lower than in any year since 1940. The prolonged agricultural depression has placed a heavy economic burden on small and individual farm operators.

One-fifth of the nation's population suffers from poverty in the midst of affluence—one in five households earns less than $2,000 a year, or less than $40 a week. Among black families, the proportion is more than two out of five households. Ten million American children live in slums. Amid the boom, there are impoverished areas and "sick" industries all over the country, and serious unemployment occurs.

Although the number of employed people nationwide is unprecedented, the increase in production since 1954 has not brought a corresponding increase in factory employment opportunities. Last year, the number of unemployed auto workers increased dramatically, and even in this peak production period, 100,000 laid-off workers have still not been absorbed. With the further expansion of automation and increased productivity, there is a danger of further expansion of unemployment.

In recent years, small businesses have not prospered either. The increase in profits has been concentrated in the largest companies. Bankruptcies of small businesses have reached the highest figures since 1939. The main beneficiaries of the boom are large trusts and monopolies. "Fortune" magazine said that 1955 "was certainly the best year for big business."

Monopolies have continued to grow and become more powerful than before. Today, the 500 largest industrial companies account for about half of total production and employment. These large companies receive the largest share of profits. In the first quarter of 1956, the largest companies (referring to companies with assets of $100 million or more) earned almost five times more profit per dollar of goods sold than smaller companies (referring to companies with assets of less than $250,000). Under the rule of the cabinet of millionaires, due to its gifts to big business and the implementation of policies that benefit big business, the speed of mergers is faster than ever before.

The huge profits of the trusts are obtained at the expense of the interests of workers, small farmers, and small businesses. Although real wages are increasing, they have not kept pace with the growth of productivity, nor have they kept pace with the more rapid growth of corporate profits, so the share of workers in their products continues to decrease.

The resolution pointed out that despite the long-term prosperity, the basic contradictions inherent in capitalist production have not been alleviated, but have become increasingly acute. And in order to finally resolve this contradiction in the interests of the people, it is only possible through the establishment of a socialist society. This long-term prosperity does not prove that the Marxist theory of crisis is invalid.

The resolution then talked about the party's past misjudgment of the development of the economic crisis, and called on the whole party to strengthen the study of American economic problems. The resolution finally put forward a six-point plan to improve the economic welfare of the working people. This plan is:

1. Take all necessary measures to protect the economic situation of the working people, so that it is not affected by the destructive consequences of the economic crisis.

2. Reduce military spending and take other measures to deal with inflation.

3. Develop a large-scale plan to develop hydroelectric power projects and water conservancy projects, as well as build highways, schools, and other indispensable public works.

4. Play an active role in the world economy, provide genuine economic assistance (rather than weapons) to less developed countries, and restore and expand trade between East and West.

5. Massively develop the economy of the underdeveloped regions of the United States (especially the South).

6. Protect national property (forests, oil, and other natural resources, as well as atomic energy equipment) and expand its scope, so that it is free from the encroachment of monopoly capital.

### 美共代表大会关于美国经济情况的决议

    美共代表大会关于美国经济情况的决议
    新华社21日讯　纽约迟到消息：纽约“工人日报”14日刊载了美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会通过的“关于美国经济情况的决议”，决议提出了美国共产党对战后十余年来美国经济情况的估价和分析。
    决议说，自从1939年以来，美国的经济有了巨大的发展。美国生产力提高了一倍多。今天，美国在生产力和财富方面超过了所有其他资本主义国家的总和。这种为一小撮大公司所垄断的巨大的力量是依赖于通过对外投资的广泛扩张而从整个资本主义世界取得贡税的。它依赖于两次世界大战和美国经济的广泛的军国主义化。它是比以前任何时候都更加贪婪、更加寄生的美帝国主义的力量。在这些年代中，相对繁荣的时期延长了——将近二十年的期间没有发生重大的经济危机。
    自从1947年以来，尽管美国经济发生了暂时的衰退，工业生产仍提高了42％。公司在纳税以前的利润增加了将近一倍。有组织的工业中的实际工资，特别是在最近几年中，已经大大提高了。到1956年年中，就业人数达到了六千六百五十万人的打破纪录的水平。
    决议指出，目前的景气又一次地引起了永久繁荣的错觉。大企业和艾森豪威尔政府的发言人说，危机已是过去的事情了。他们还说，我们已经发展了一种“人民资本主义”，在这种“人民资本主义”中，劳动人民得到的一份收入和财富将逐渐增加，而大企业得到的一份收入和财富将下降。
    决议说，华尔街所制造的这种错觉是完全没有根据的。事实上，就是激起景气的这些因素也促进了潜伏的经济不稳定性和生产力和市场之间的不平衡状态。这些因素中突出的因素是：
    （一）整个战后期间对固定资本的投资为数始终很高。这主要是由于需要通过技术进步，通过扩大基本的工业能力以适应美国垄断资本在世界上的扩大了的作用和军事计划，从而恢复战争在世界范围内造成的损失和满足国内缺货，以及更新陈旧不堪的装备。与此同时，经久耐用消费品市场有了扩大，住宅建筑业有了长期的景气。
    但是今天工业能力增长的速度远远超过了购买力增长的速度。这种悬殊状况最后将达到这样的地步：不顾市场不够充分而继续不断扩展将不再是有利可图的事，资本的投资将减少。
    （二）政府开支大大增长。就目前这个财政年度来说，各级政府的开支总计将达一千亿美元，其中联邦政府的开支就占六百九十亿美元左右。
    联邦开支约有三分之二用于国家“安全”方面。因此在很大程度上，日常经济的高度水平的基础是由不可靠的武器开支所支撑的。这种开支所引起的结果之一是：战后的通货膨胀使消费品价格和生活费用上升到有史以来的最高水平；联邦负债两千七百六十亿美元，只稍低于第二次世界大战时的最高数字，利息达数十亿美元；赋税负担消耗了一般工人的三分之一的收入。
    （三）私人信贷空前膨胀。公司债务自从1945年以来增加了一倍半。个人债务——房屋抵押和消费者债务——已经增加到一千三百七十亿美元，其中有一千多亿美元是在过去的十年中积累起来的。仅是消费者信贷就增加到将近四百一十亿美元，等于消费者的全部可以自由支配的收入的15％，这是一个空前高的比例。
    决议说，1954年以来，经济高涨主要是由于这种信贷膨胀，和对大企业大量减扣税款和赠与。因而，今天的美国经济相当呈现出一种典型的和平时期的投机性景气的面貌，在很多方面都使人想起二十年代的景气。信贷量的越来越增加和随之而来的进一步膨胀的威胁大大地促进了潜伏的经济不稳定性。
    （四）战后国外投资增加。今天，美国在国外的各种形式的投资总数为四百五十亿美元，即战前投资的四倍，并且所取回的利润（公开和不公开的）估计每年将近一百亿美元。在美国的主要工业部门中，从国外投资所得的利润在总利润中所占的比率从10％到高达像石油托辣斯的50％。这些投资和利润超过了一切其他帝国主义国家投资和利润的总和（除此以外，还有对我国的黑人所进行的过度剥削而得到的数十亿美元超额利润）。
    决议说，殖民体系的日益崩溃和民族解放运动的日益壮大使这些国外投资基础非常不稳定，威胁着建立在帝国主义剥削上的整个寄生结构。
    显然，前面所述的特点使得经济的前途远不像有些人要使我们相信的那么安稳可靠。
    决议又说，今天美国经济的景气根本没有给所有的人带来繁荣。从1947年到1956年中，农业收入减少了三分之一。农业部报告说，在1955年，农业净收入要比1940年以来任何一年都要低。农业持久的萧条使得小规模的和个体农场经营者受到了沉重的经济负担。
    全国有五分之一的人口在富足的环境中受到贫穷之苦——每五户人家中就有一户一年赚不到二千美元，即一个星期不到四十美元。在黑人家庭中，比例是每五户人家中有两户以上是这样。一千万美国儿童住在贫民窟。在景气声中，这个国家到处都有贫困地区和“病态”工业，并且发生严重失业的情况。
    虽然全国的就业人数是空前的，1954年以来生产的增加并没有带来工厂就业机会的相应增加。去年汽车工人失业人数有了惊人的增加，在目前这个生产顶峰时期，也仍然有十万被解雇者还没有被吸收进去。随着自动化的进一步扩大和生产率的增加，失业有进一步扩大的危险。
    在最近几年中，小企业也没有繁荣起来，利润的上升一直集中在最大的公司，自从1939年以来，小企业破产已经达到了最高的数字。主要享受到景气的利益的是大托辣斯和垄断组织。“幸福”杂志说，1955年“肯定是大企业最好的年头”。
    垄断组织一直在继续增长，比以前变得更加强大了。今天五百家最大的工业公司大约占全部生产和就业人数的一半。这些大公司所获利润占最大部分。1956年的第一季度中，最大的公司（指有资产一亿或一亿以上美元的公司）每卖一元货的利润几乎等于较小的公司（指有资产二十五万美元以下的公司）的利润的五倍。在富豪内阁的统治下，由于它对大企业的赠与和执行有利于大企业的政策，合并的速度比以前任何时候都要快。
    托辣斯的巨额利润是靠牺牲工人、小农和小企业的利益得到的。虽然实际工资在增加，但是并没有赶上生产率的增长，也没有赶上公司利润的更加迅速的增长，这样工人在他的产品中所得的一份也就继续减少。
    决议指出，尽管有长期的繁荣，但是资本主义生产所固有的基本矛盾并没有缓和，而是日益尖锐了。而为了人民的利益最后解决这个矛盾，只有通过建立社会主义社会。这种长期的繁荣并不能证明马克思主义关于危机的理论是无效的。
    决议接着谈到党过去对经济危机发展的估计不当，并且号召全党加强对美国经济问题的研究。决议最后提出了一个改善劳动人民经济福利的六点计划。这个计划是：
    一、采取一切必要的措施来保护劳动人民的经济情况，使它不受经济危机的破坏性的后果的影响。
    二、减少军备开支，并且采取其他措施来应付通货膨胀。
    三、制定一个规模宏大的计划来发展水力发电工程和水利工程以及建筑公路、学校和其他不可缺少的公共工程。
    四、在世界经济上起积极的作用，对不大发达的国家提供真正的经济援助（而不是武器），恢复和扩大东西方的贸易。
    五、大规模地发展美国的不发达地区（特别是南方）的经济。
    六、保护国家财产（森林、石油和其他天然资源、以及原子能设备）和扩大它的范围，使它免受垄断资本的侵犯。
