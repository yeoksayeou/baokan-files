	Mongolia Achieves Bumper Livestock Harvest
	By Our Correspondent Féng Yè
	White snow covers the Mongolian grasslands.

	Having fought a major victory on the front lines of livestock production in 1956, the herders of the Mongolian People's Republic face the test of wind, snow, and severe cold. "Livestock must safely overwinter!" This is not only a battle cry to overcome natural disasters but has also become the practical action of the broad masses of people. Mongolian herders have been mobilized and are carrying out work to protect livestock from the cold, whether on the grasslands or in the Gobi.

	In the midst of wind, snow, and severe cold, the leaders of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government have gone deep into pastoral areas to inspect the wintering of livestock and help solve specific problems that exist. Comrade Barjinyam, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Minister of Animal Husbandry, returned from inspecting the provinces of the former Khangai and other provinces, and once told me: Mongolia has a long winter, and preparations have been made for wind and snow disasters. The herders are organized, and the government will do its best to help the herders overcome the threat of severe winter.

	This minister, who has led livestock production for many years, said calmly and confidently: The million head of livestock that the herders gained this year must not be lost in the cold winter.

	Indeed, 1956 was a victorious year for Mongolian livestock production, a bumper harvest for more than ten years after the war. Seventeen of the country's eighteen provinces and cities have overfulfilled their livestock breeding plans, and Choybalsan Province, which did not complete the plan, also reached 95% of the plan.

	This is indeed good news. The country has increased by more than 1.3 million head of livestock in one year. This means that, in addition to what the herders ate, drank, and used this year, more than one million head of livestock have been added to the Mongolian grasslands. The number of livestock in Mongolia is the highest standard in the world, averaging more than twenty heads per person according to the national population; and in 1956, the average person increased by more than one head. The livestock economy occupies a very important position in Mongolia's national economy. When the good news of the bumper harvest came, everyone was overjoyed. In order to protect the wealth of the people, a fiery struggle against wind and snow can be seen everywhere on the grasslands.

	Not long ago, we visited the Central Province of Mongolia.

	The capital of the Central Province is only about a hundred li away from Ulaanbaatar. The windows of our car, speeding across the grassland, quickly condensed a layer of beautiful ice flowers. The grasslands and hills were covered with snow, and in some places even the tips of the grass were covered.

	On the way, we often encountered herders riding tall camels head-on. The camels were puffing out white air, striding forward with their heads held high, seemingly unaffected by the severe cold of minus thirty or forty degrees Celsius.

	These days, the Provincial Party Congress of the Central Province is being held in the provincial capital "Tsomodo" (translated into Chinese means "one hundred trees"). The results of the hard work of the province's herders over the past year are also on display here.

	The proportion of the socialist economy in animal husbandry in the Central Province is larger than in other provinces. Of the twenty state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in Mongolia, nine are in the Central Province. In addition, there are eight haymaking stations here.

	In 1956, the development of livestock production cooperatives in the Central Province was very rapid, tripling compared to the previous year. Now, each county has two to eight production cooperatives. Both the number of members and the number of livestock have increased compared to the previous year.

	The province has already overfulfilled its livestock breeding plan for 1956. The increase in numbers shows the superiority of collective labor: the livestock in state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms increased by 14%, the cooperatives increased by 9.2%, and individual herders increased by only 3.1%.

	In addition to breeding and raising livestock, state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms also sow grains, feed, and vegetables. These agricultural and pastoral farms all use machines. The cultivated area in 1956 more than doubled compared to 1955, with a total harvest of more than 19,000 tons of grain. Agricultural and pastoral farms ensiled a large amount of corn, allowing livestock to eat nutritious feed in winter.

	I met Comrade Nazak, who has been the head of a haymaking station for more than ten years. He was wearing a brand-new yellow Mongolian robe and looked to be in his fifties. He introduced the work of the haymaking station to me in an orderly manner. This haymaking station was established in 1954, and has overfulfilled its production tasks every year for the past three years. The haymaking station has extensive contacts with livestock production cooperatives and individual herders. Three years ago, there were only eleven workers in the station, but now there are forty-four workers. There are also seven Chinese workers in this station, and they cooperate very well with the Mongolian workers.

	How is their production plan completed? Nazak said that the first thing is that the Party's work and production work are closely combined. Production must be planned. For example, hay is mowed in the autumn, but the production tools are repaired as early as the spring. The workers cherish the machines very much and are willing to master them skillfully. Several young men in the station have mastered the technology of driving tractors, and their efficiency is very high.

	This station achieved remarkable results in 1955 and received the mobile Red Flag for labor competition from the Council of Ministers.

	On the afternoon of the closing day of the Central Provincial Party Congress, I saw a moving scene: the Provincial Party Committee handed two mobile Red Flags to an advanced county and an advanced livestock production cooperative respectively.

	The solemn flag-awarding ceremony began. Wenzhur County, the advanced county that received the mobile Red Flag, had overfulfilled its breeding plans for all kinds of livestock. Erdun County, which had received the Red Flag last year but lost it this time, also completed its livestock breeding plan, but Wenzhur County had better results than it. The representative of Erdun County congratulated the representative of Wenzhur County on receiving the Red Flag and said: We will surpass Wenzhur County in the production of 1957 and take back the lost Red Flag.

	Awarding the mobile Red Flag to the livestock production cooperative is considered a beginning this time. The advanced "Dawn" Production Cooperative received the Red Flag for the first time.

	The "Dawn" Cooperative has overfulfilled its breeding plans for cattle, horses, camels, and sheep, completing 108% to 135%. The haymaking tasks and the tasks of paying livestock products to the state have also been completed on schedule.

	Like the "Dawn" Cooperative, the production achievements of the vast majority of production cooperatives in the Central Province are very good, and the income of the members has generally increased. The amount of meat, milk, and flour that each member should receive for each working day has increased compared to the past.

	The representatives of the counties and production cooperatives that received the Red Flags all expressed their confidence and wishes at this meeting. They want to protect the livestock safely through the winter and then breed more livestock in 1957. × × ×

	The tens of millions of large and small livestock in the Mongolian People's Republic are distributed on the grasslands and deserts throughout the country, and livestock production is considerably influenced by natural conditions. However, thanks to the effective measures taken by the Mongolian government and the active production of the herders, many difficulties have been overcome. The increase in livestock production in 1956 is a good proof.

	What measures did the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government take this year?

	In order to increase the people's interest in developing animal husbandry and improve the people's material and cultural life, the government revised the methods for purchasing livestock products. According to the new method, the state reduced the quota for purchasing livestock products such as meat, fur, and milk from the herders, and appropriately increased the purchase price of livestock products. In this way, the income of the herders also increased.

	In 1956, the state lent more than 10 million tugriks (Mongolian currency) in long-term and short-term loans to the herders. The herders used these loans to build livestock sheds, purchase production tools and fodder, and dig wells, solving part of the material resources needed for livestock to survive the winter.

	Several years ago, Mongolia attached importance to the cultivation of artificial feed, and the amount of cultivated feed per head of livestock has been increasing. In particular, state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms and livestock production cooperatives have their own feed bases, and the planting area and yield per unit area are gradually increasing. This is a strong material basis for ensuring that livestock can resist natural disasters.

	According to the natural conditions of Mongolia's particularly long winter, mowing more hay and building more sheds are of great significance for avoiding hunger and cold for livestock in the severe winter. There are dozens of mowing stations across the country, and the amount of hay mowed last year increased compared to the past. More than ten thousand new fixed or mobile sheds have been built in various places.

	The superiority of collective labor was even more significant in livestock production in 1956. This year was a year of rapid development of livestock production cooperatives. The state held training courses in Ulaanbaatar to train cadres for the cooperatives. Over the past year, more than 300 new cooperatives have been established, about one and a half times more than in the past. The number of livestock in the cooperatives increased by 6.8% in 1955 compared to 1954, and 18.2% in 1956 compared to 1955. The cooperatives sold livestock products to the state and purchased the transportation tools and production tools they needed.

	Based on the requirements of the herders, the Mongolian Council of Ministers advanced the time of livestock mating by more than a month starting in 1956. The date of birth of young livestock is getting closer and closer. While protecting large livestock through the winter, the herders must also welcome the birth of small livestock. They face a glorious and arduous task.

	These days, the temperature on the Mongolian grasslands has begun to rise, and people feel warmer than they did a few days ago. The severe winter will eventually pass. At the beginning of 1957, the herders will strive to achieve greater achievements in livestock production. (Attached pictures)

    蒙古牲畜大丰产	本报记者　逢烨
    白雪复盖着蒙古草原。
    1956年在牧业生产战线上打了一个大胜仗的蒙古人民共和国牧民，面临着风雪严寒的考验。“牲畜必须安全过冬！”这不仅是战胜自然灾害的战斗口号，而且变成了广大人民的实际行动。蒙古牧民们已经动员起来，无论在草原或戈壁，都展开了抗寒保畜的工作。
    在风雪严寒中，蒙古人民革命党和政府的领导人都分头深入牧区，检查牲畜过冬工作，帮助解决当前存在的具体问题。蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员、畜牧业部长巴尔任尼雅姆同志，由前杭爱等省检查回来，曾经对我说：蒙古的冬天很长，对于风雪灾害已经早有准备，牧民们都组织起来了，政府要尽最大的力量帮助牧民战胜严冬的威胁。
    这位多年领导牧业生产的部长，平静而又满怀信心地说：牧民们一年来得到的百万头牲畜，不能让它在寒冬里受到损失。
    是的，1956年是蒙古牧业生产的胜利年，是战后十多年来的一次大丰产。全国十八个省市有十七个省市都超额完成了牲畜增殖计划，没有完成计划的乔巴山省也达到了计划的95％。
    这确实是一个喜讯。全国在一年中纯增殖了一百三十多万头牲畜。这就是说，除了牧民们这一年吃的、喝的和用的以外，在蒙古草原上又增多了一百几十万头牲畜。蒙古所有的牲畜头数，按全国人口平均计算，每人有二十几头，是世界上最高的标准；而在1956年内，平均每个人又增加了一头多。畜牧业经济在蒙古的国民经济中占很重要的地位。丰产的喜讯传来，人们莫不欢欣鼓舞。为了保护好人民的财富，在草原上，到处可以看到人们同风雪进行着火热的斗争。
    不久以前，我们访问了蒙古的中央省。
    中央省的省城离乌兰巴托市只有一百来里路，我们乘坐的汽车在草原上奔驰了没有多久，车窗上便凝结了一层美丽的冰花。草原上、丘陵上都堆满了雪，有的地方连草尖也给掩盖住了。
    在途中，我们不时碰到骑着高大的骆驼迎面而来的牧民。骆驼喷着白气，昂首阔步，好像并不感到零下三、四十度的严寒。
    这几天，在中央省的省城“昭茂都”（译成汉语是“一百棵树”的意思），正召开省的党代表大会。全省牧民一年来辛勤劳动所得的成果，也在这儿展览。
    中央省畜牧业的社会主义经济比重，比其他省大一些。蒙古全国现有的二十个国营农牧场中，就有九个在中央省。另外，这里还有八个打草站。
    1956年，中央省的牧业生产合作社发展很快，比前一年增加了三倍，现在每个县都有两个到八个生产合作社。入社的社员和牲畜都比上一年增加了。
    全省已经超额完成了1956年的牲畜增殖计划，增殖的数字表明了集体劳动的优越性：国营农牧场的牲畜增殖了14％，合作社的增殖了9.2％，而个体牧民的只增殖了3.1％。
    国营农牧场除了繁殖和饲养牲畜外，还播种谷物、饲料和蔬菜。这些农牧场都使用着机器。1956年的耕地面积比1955年增加了一倍多，共收粮食一万九千多吨。农牧场青贮了大量的玉蜀黍，使牲畜在冬天也能吃到营养丰富的饲料。
    我会见了做过十多年打草站站长的那扎克同志。他穿着崭新的黄色蒙古袍子，看样子有五十开外的年纪。他有条有理地向我介绍了打草站的工作。这个打草站是在1954年成立的，三年来，年年都超额完成生产任务。打草站和牧业生产合作社、个体牧民都有广泛的联系。三年前，站里只有十一个工人，现在已经有四十四个工人了。在这个站里还有七个中国工人，他们和蒙古工人合作得很好。
    他们的生产计划是怎样完成的呢？那扎克说，首先是党的工作和生产工作紧密结合。生产要有计划。比如秋天打草，但早在春天就把生产工具修理好了。工人们很爱惜机器，也愿意熟练地掌握机器。站里有几个年轻小伙子都掌握了开拖拉机的技术，效率都很高。
    这个站在1955年的成绩很显著，得到了部长会议的劳动竞赛流动红旗。
    在中央省党代表大会闭幕的那天下午，我看到了一个动人的场面：省党委会把两面流动红旗分别交给一个先进县和一个先进牧业生产合作社。
    庄严的授旗仪式开始了。得到流动红旗的先进的温珠尔县，各种牲畜的增殖计划都超额完成了。上一年得到红旗而在这次失去红旗的额尔敦县，也完成了牲畜增殖计划，但温珠尔县比它的成绩更好。额尔敦县的代表向得到红旗的温珠尔县代表祝贺，并且说：我们要在1957年的生产中，超过温珠尔县，把失去的红旗拿回来。
    向牧业生产合作社授予流动红旗，这次算是一个开端。先进的“曙光”生产合作社首次得到了红旗。
    “曙光”合作社的牛、马、骆驼和羊各类牲畜都超额完成了增殖计划，完成了108％到135％。打草任务和向国家缴纳畜产品的任务也都按期完成了。
    像“曙光”合作社一样，中央省的绝大多数生产合作社的生产成绩都很好，社员的收入普遍有了增加，社员每一个劳动日应得的肉、奶和面粉量都比过去增多了。
    得到红旗的县和生产合作社的代表们，都在这个会上表示了自己的信心和愿望，他们要保护牲畜安全过冬，然后在1957年内增殖更多的牲畜。×　×　×
    蒙古人民共和国的二千几百万头大小牲畜，分布在全国的草原和戈壁上，牧业生产受着自然条件的相当程度的影响。但是，由于蒙古政府采取了各项有效的措施，由于牧民们组织起来积极生产，许多困难都被克服了。1956年的牲畜增产就是一个很好的证明。
    这一年，蒙古人民革命党和政府采取了哪些措施呢？
    政府为了提高人民发展畜牧业的兴趣，改善人民的物质文化生活，修订了畜产品的征购办法。根据新办法，国家向牧民征购肉类、皮毛和牛奶等畜产品的定额减低了，收购畜产品的价格适当提高了。这样，牧民的收入也增多了。
    国家在1956年内向牧民贷放了长期和短期贷款一千多万图格里克（蒙币），牧民们用这些贷款搭盖了牲畜棚圈，购备了生产工具和草料，挖掘了水井，解决了牲畜过冬需要的部分物质资料。
    几年前，蒙古就已重视人工饲料的栽培问题，每头牲畜得到栽培饲料的数量越来越多了。特别是国营农牧场和牧业生产合作社，都有自己的饲料基地，农业种植面积和单位面积的产量都在逐步增长。这是保证牲畜抗御自然灾害的有力的物质基础。
    根据蒙古冬天特别长的自然条件，多打草，多搭棚圈，对于避免牲畜在严冬遭受饥寒，是有很大意义的。全国有几十个马拉机割草站，去年打草的数量比过去增加了。各地新搭盖了一万几千个固定或流动的棚圈。
    集体劳动的优越性在1956年的牧业生产中更加显著了。这一年，是牧业生产合作社发展较快的一年。国家在乌兰巴托市举办了训练班，培养了合作社的干部。一年来，新建了三百几十个合作社，比过去增多了一倍半左右。合作社的牲畜头数1955年比1954年增加6.8％，1956年比1955年增加18.2％。合作社向国家出售了畜产品，添购了他们需要的运输工具和生产工具。
    蒙古部长会议根据牧民的要求，从1956年起，把牲畜交配的时间提前了一个多月。幼畜降生的日期已经一天天迫近了。牧民们在保护大牲畜过冬的同时，又要迎接小牲畜的降生。他们面临着光荣而艰巨的任务。
    这几天，蒙古草原上的气温开始上升，人们都感到比前些日子暖和起来了。寒冬终究是要过去的。牧民们将在1957年的开头，争取在牧业生产上获得更大的成就。（附图片）
