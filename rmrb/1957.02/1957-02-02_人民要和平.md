    The People Want Peace
      By Australian writer Dymphna Cusack
    For seven years, I have been to many countries. Now, in these critical days, trying to piece together the news revealed in newspapers and letters sent from Australia and Britain, France and Italy, Africa and America, the West Indies and the East, I find that the policies of many governments are diametrically opposed to the wishes of the people.
    Apart from warmongering official communiques and acts of aggression, I often see vast masses of people in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and East and West who just want peace and friendship. The more one travels, the more one meets people from distant countries, the clearer it becomes that people everywhere have a consistent desire for peace, knowing that they can only get sorrow and pain from war.
    Like Shamivil, who lives in Cristobal Colon, one of the twin towns at the western mouth of the Panama Canal. Shamivil is a black man whose father came with others from Jamaica to build the Panama Canal. He left Jamaica because he could not make a living there.
    "But what's the use?" Shamivil asked, shaking his large black hands. "I can't make a living here either. I'm forty-seven years old, but I can't afford to get married."
    Shamivil didn't understand why I preferred to observe the dirty, crowded slum streets of this native city, rather than relax on the wide, fashionable boulevards of the American zone and admire the magnificent and luxurious residences built for American military and political officers. The contrast is as stark as in old Shanghai, and as in the port of Naples today. There, many fashionable residences are built on the steep slopes of the bay, while not far away, many Neapolitans live in unsanitary caves. Naples is the base for the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet.
    War does not help Shamivil. Although he gets more money, prices have risen even higher, making his life even worse. He doesn't understand why, but a Panamanian friend of his, who runs a small restaurant (where we had a delicious spicy chili stir-fry), understands very well, and he knows why most people in Panama and neighboring countries are poor. I learned about Panamanian politics from him. I learned about the lives of Panamanians from Shamivil, who are all as poor as he is. He said thoughtfully, "I want a cottage, a garden, and enough money to get married, and no war."
    In Jamaica, I found a local doctor who truly knew why the West Indies were so poor. From all these islands (beautiful pearls scattered around the Caribbean), I also saw the same rich-poor opposition that one can see in every colonial area. Everywhere I could hear voices expressing Shamivil's hopes in different dialects.
    I met people from British Guiana who were very clear that as long as they remained in a colonial status, they could not hope for prosperity and peace.
    They said, "Things must change, but peaceful and constitutional change."
    Let the British know that their warships and troop carriers are wrong to enter the Caribbean.
    The Guatemalans have the same idea: peacefully implementing constitutional change is the way. The American plane brought many passengers, these are murderers, let them know that they are also wrong.
    Poor Shamivil! The other millions of Shamivils in the countries along the Caribbean coast dominated by oil, fruit, and sugar monopolies, they only ask for a cottage, a garden, and peace.
    Last spring, when I walked through the streets of Rome and saw slogans everywhere proclaiming, "War is a luxury we cannot afford," I thought of Shamivil. These words were spoken by President Gronchi to the U.S. Congress during his visit to the United States. From the southern end of Italy to the northern end, I have heard this same idea expressed in different ways.
    In a small fishing port, I spent the winter, hearing stories of the suffering and real hunger of farmers and fishermen, and I can still see my friend Augusto, a middle-aged man who suffered under Fascism, fought in Ethiopia, and was forced to evacuate when the Allied forces counterattacked, starving in the mountains with seven children. American planes bombed the village to the ground. Now, twelve years later, the farmers are still living in shacks because the houses being built are too expensive for them.
    One afternoon, Augusto watched a squadron of Italian fighter planes fly overhead and said, "Ah! War preparations are very thorough, yet all we need is to be fed and live a peaceful life."
    Farmers whose early autumn crops had been destroyed by frost came to me and said, "How can we immigrate? There's nothing to eat here."
    This is absolutely true, but this does not prevent the Italian police from shooting two farmers when they and others marched towards parliament to demand "bread and work."
    From one end of Italy to the other, from impoverished farmers to wealthy freelancers, I have never heard any of them talk about war. The exception is that they only talk about war with a tone of disgust. The newspapers expressed the people's wishes, publishing Pope Pius's Christmas message in large headlines, in which he condemned the use of atomic weapons. Twenty years of Fascist oppression, three years of Nazi occupation, and the ever-present two million unemployed (increasing to 4.5 million in winter), Italy has no hope other than to look forward to peace and the trade it brings.
    In France, I lived with families of all types and faiths. I was still in France during the Vietnam War, and at no time did I hear anything but "dirty war."
    When the French parliament debated the rearmament of Germany for the second time, I saw people pouring into Paris from all over France. They came in groups: from factories, from schools, from railway towns, from universities, from farms. They came in pairs; they came in hundreds and thousands. There were women whose sons had died in the fight against Nazism; there were millions of widows who had lost their husbands in the war; there were parents and wives whose sons and husbands had died in German concentration camps and gas chambers. In the biting cold wind of December, under the rain and snow, the masses gathered outside the parliament building from morning till late at night. They lined up endlessly to meet with their members of parliament.
    Finally, when the law on the rearmament of West Germany was passed under the intolerable pressure of Britain and the United States, a large police force completely surrounded the parliament building. On the way to the airport, I asked the taxi driver, "Why?" He said, "They are afraid; they know that the people do not want war, and a rearmed Germany means war."
    From one end of France to the other, such slogans were painted: "Yankees go home." When an American friend (who was a liberal American) walked into his own room in a hotel, his suitcase was also stuck with a small flag with the same slogan. This slogan was often accompanied by another slogan: "Down with war."
    At literary receptions, in French bourgeois families, in peasant families, on trains, the mood suddenly erupted as soon as the possibility of a new war was mentioned.
    A seventy-year-old janitor in the building where I lived asked me: "France has been drained by two world wars and ravaged by five years of Nazi occupation. What did we get from the war in North Africa? My father died in the war of 1870, my husband died in the war of 1917, and my son died in the last war. What did I get? Only the wealthy 'colonial groups' benefited from the war in North Africa. For us, prices have risen. My daughter and her husband can't find a room and have to live with their children in a hotel room, and the hotel owner charges a lot of rent because the government spends trillions of francs on war and doesn't spend enough money on housing. At least let my grandchildren have peace. Enough blood has been shed to win peace for them." She turned around and walked quickly into her room, so that I wouldn't see her cry.
    In small villages, as in large cities in France, I have seen many large-scale demonstrations demanding an end to colonial wars. The French army, sent to Algeria, mutinied en masse, blocking trains and destroying transportation. The stations where military trains departed were surrounded by large crowds to prevent military vehicles from moving. There is an active fascist element, which is not large, but when it attacks democratic forces, the police turn a blind eye.
    The same is true in the Netherlands. Six years ago, the masses protested against sending troops to Indonesia. Boys refused to board ships. New recruits and demonstrators were imprisoned. The struggle has never stopped.
    West German students had long ago decided that good statements alone were not enough, that action had to be included. As a result, there were large demonstrations against the plan to remilitarize Germany. The movement is still going on, with recent demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of American troops, because murders, rapes, and thefts often occur in the centers occupied by American troops.
    The vast majority of politically backward and ideologically poisoned American troops cannot even vaguely understand what is happening. As one of them said to me in a French cafe: "They told us to go home, we were sent here to protect the people from communist enslavement! But when we came here, we found that the people hate us even more than they hate the 'communists'. In the United States, we hear about the threat of Red China twenty-four hours a day. But in Paris, Rome, London and a dozen other cities, people are mesmerized by Chinese Peking opera. Our congressmen tell us about the nightmare of Russia dropping bombs on us, but everywhere we go in Europe, there seem to be hordes of Russian tourists. What does that mean?"
    I told him in monosyllables what "that means". I am sure he will not believe me. But when we nodded goodbye to each other, it seemed that he was thinking.
    People hear the same desire for peace expressed in different languages. In Switzerland, I met two wealthy Greeks who told me that the current so-called "defense" policy imposed by the United States corrupted Greece, insulted her national aspirations, and drove her deeper into poverty and unemployment.
    They said: "War will destroy us all together. We need peace and friendship with all countries to restore our country."
    Compared with other belligerent countries, the two world wars had a relatively lighter impact on Britain. But, despite their imperialism and their wealth from the exploitation of colonies, the people are becoming more and more aware. The current protests may finally lead to action. Even in the minds of conservatives, there is a growing perception that the presence of so many American atomic bomber bases on British soil means that they will be the first to suffer in any future war.
    The war in Malaya, the suppression of the national movement in British Guiana, and the start of military occupation of Kenya and Cyprus have not caused as widespread and active protests as in France and the Netherlands, but the scope of verbal protests is expanding.
    My guide asked me: "What did I get in Africa for four years? A leg injury, no pension, living in a damp basement, prices are often higher than my wages, and there is a constant threat of being drafted again. Thank God, I don't want war!"
    The housekeeper stopped cleaning my room, leaned on her broom, and listened to the radio news, which reported the threat of a new war.
    When I turned off the radio, she said: "After suffering the hardships of the last war, if there is another war, I will throw myself into the river."
    The owner of a beautiful country house I was visiting looked at the sky sadly as giant bombers roared towards the base a few miles away and said, "My ancestors have lived here for three hundred years, and now I am afraid I will have to sell this house, because there is no peace day or night, and the American army has made this area uninhabitable."
    I kept silent, wanting to hear what a conservative landlord was thinking.
    He continued: "I participated in both world wars; I never thought I would see the day when I could not walk on the common land because a foreign flag was flying on it." I don't think he would understand why all this happened, but as a Briton, his patriotism was deeply wounded. He said: "This kind of thing makes me think that there is something wrong with our policies."
    A few nights before leaving London, I talked to a Nigerian friend, who told me that even conservative Nigerians are gradually reaching the same conclusion, seeing that their hope for complete national independence is being frustrated by colonialism, which often continues to exist under different names, and often resorts to armed terror when the people's demands become more resolute.
    He said: "Our people only ask for the freedom and peace to create their own future, and the money that was taken from us in the form of our natural wealth in the past and the billions of pounds wasted on 'defense' is enough to give us the schools needed to educate 94% of our children. They have no schools to go to."
    My friends in New York, the Midwest, and California are all saying the same thing in their letters. They are surprisingly naive. They elected Eisenhower because he promised them peace in Korea. Then they found a Secretary of State who wanted to bring the world to the "brink of war". They are heavily taxed to defend themselves against the fictitious Russian aggression. But the Soviet Union insists on banning nuclear war, stopping nuclear testing, and proposes signing a non-aggression pact.
    An American woman said to me: "We experienced bad times during the depression of the 1930s. I had only been married for a short time when my husband joined the Pacific War. Now my son is sixteen years old, and I live in fear that he will be drafted into another war. Why can't you understand that we crave peace just as much as you do?"
    The American Gallup poll proves that the vast majority of people are in favor of negotiations. An American university lecturer asked me: "Tell me the truth about China." Many, many letters from all over the world make the same request to me.
    While writing this article, I think of my friends all over the globe. Their faces flash before me like a movie. My Australian friends wrote: "Our National Peace Congress was a great achievement. Thousands of delegates came from all over Australia and New Zealand, representing all walks of life." The charming silhouette of a Ceylon woman, who said in a musical voice: "We want peace so that we can build a free, prosperous country." The dark and heroic face of a Calcutta woman, who is dedicated to the struggle for friendship between nations. The strong, proud face of a middle-class British woman, who is a dear friend of mine, who gives her time, her life, and her money to the cause of peace.
    I hear the word "peace" shouted in various languages. This is the most beautiful word in the world. Because peace means the freedom to create the world we need.
