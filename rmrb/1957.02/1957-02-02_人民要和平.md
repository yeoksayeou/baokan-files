    The People Want Peace
      By Australian writer Dymphna Cusack
    For seven years, I have been to many countries. Now, in these critical days, trying to piece together the news revealed in newspapers and letters sent from Australia and Britain, France and Italy, Africa and America, the West Indies and the East, I find that the policies of many governments are diametrically opposed to the wishes of the people.
    Apart from warmongering official communiques and acts of aggression, I often see vast masses of people in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and East and West who just want peace and friendship. The more one travels, the more one meets people from distant countries, the clearer it becomes that people everywhere have a consistent desire for peace, knowing that they can only get sorrow and pain from war.
    Like Shamivil, who lives in Cristobal Colon, one of the twin towns at the western mouth of the Panama Canal. Shamivil is a black man whose father came with others from Jamaica to build the Panama Canal. He left Jamaica because he could not make a living there.
    "But what's the use?" Shamivil asked, shaking his large black hands. "I can't make a living here either. I'm forty-seven years old, but I can't afford to get married."
    Shamivil didn't understand why I preferred to observe the dirty, crowded slum streets of this native city, rather than relax on the wide, fashionable boulevards of the American zone and admire the magnificent and luxurious residences built for American military and political officers. The contrast is as stark as in old Shanghai, and as in the port of Naples today. There, many fashionable residences are built on the steep slopes of the bay, while not far away, many Neapolitans live in unsanitary caves. Naples is the base for the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet.
    War does not help Shamivil. Although he gets more money, prices have risen even higher, making his life even worse. He doesn't understand why, but a Panamanian friend of his, who runs a small restaurant (where we had a delicious spicy chili stir-fry), understands very well, and he knows why most people in Panama and neighboring countries are poor. I learned about Panamanian politics from him. I learned about the lives of Panamanians from Shamivil, who are all as poor as he is. He said thoughtfully, "I want a cottage, a garden, and enough money to get married, and no war."
    In Jamaica, I found a local doctor who truly knew why the West Indies were so poor. From all these islands (beautiful pearls scattered around the Caribbean), I also saw the same rich-poor opposition that one can see in every colonial area. Everywhere I could hear voices expressing Shamivil's hopes in different dialects.
    I met people from British Guiana who were very clear that as long as they remained in a colonial status, they could not hope for prosperity and peace.
    They said, "Things must change, but peaceful and constitutional change."
    Let the British know that their warships and troop carriers are wrong to enter the Caribbean.
    The Guatemalans have the same idea: peacefully implementing constitutional change is the way. The American plane brought many passengers, these are murderers, let them know that they are also wrong.
    Poor Shamivil! The other millions of Shamivils in the countries along the Caribbean coast dominated by oil, fruit, and sugar monopolies, they only ask for a cottage, a garden, and peace.
    Last spring, when I walked through the streets of Rome and saw slogans everywhere proclaiming, "War is a luxury we cannot afford," I thought of Shamivil. These words were spoken by President Gronchi to the U.S. Congress during his visit to the United States. From the southern end of Italy to the northern end, I have heard this same idea expressed in different ways.
    In a small fishing port, I spent the winter, hearing stories of the suffering and real hunger of farmers and fishermen, and I can still see my friend Augusto, a middle-aged man who suffered under Fascism, fought in Ethiopia, and was forced to evacuate when the Allied forces counterattacked, starving in the mountains with seven children. American planes bombed the village to the ground. Now, twelve years later, the farmers are still living in shacks because the houses being built are too expensive for them.
    One afternoon, Augusto watched a squadron of Italian fighter planes fly overhead and said, "Ah! War preparations are very thorough, yet all we need is to be fed and live a peaceful life."
    Farmers whose early autumn crops had been destroyed by frost came to me and said, "How can we immigrate? There's nothing to eat here."
    This is absolutely true, but this does not prevent the Italian police from shooting two farmers when they and others marched towards parliament to demand "bread and work."
    From one end of Italy to the other, from impoverished farmers to wealthy freelancers, I have never heard any of them talk about war. The exception is that they only talk about war with a tone of disgust. The newspapers expressed the people's wishes, publishing Pope Pius's Christmas message in large headlines, in which he condemned the use of atomic weapons. Twenty years of Fascist oppression, three years of Nazi occupation, and the ever-present two million unemployed (increasing to 4.5 million in winter), Italy has no hope other than to look forward to peace and the trade it brings.
    In France, I lived with families of all types and faiths. I was still in France during the Vietnam War, and at no time did I hear anything but "dirty war."
    When the French parliament debated the rearmament of Germany for the second time, I saw people pouring into Paris from all over France. They came in groups: from factories, from schools, from railway towns, from universities, from farms. They came in pairs; they came in hundreds and thousands. There were women whose sons had died in the fight against Nazism; there were millions of widows who had lost their husbands in the war; there were parents and wives whose sons and husbands had died in German concentration camps and gas chambers. In the biting cold wind of December, under the rain and snow, the masses gathered outside the parliament building from morning till late at night. They lined up endlessly to meet with their members of parliament.
    Finally, when the law on the rearmament of West Germany was passed under the intolerable pressure of Britain and the United States, a large police force completely surrounded the parliament building. On the way to the airport, I asked the taxi driver, "Why?" He said, "They are afraid; they know that the people do not want war, and a rearmed Germany means war."
    From one end of France to the other, such slogans were painted: "Yankees go home." When an American friend (who was a liberal American) walked into his own room in a hotel, his suitcase was also stuck with a small flag with the same slogan. This slogan was often accompanied by another slogan: "Down with war."
    At literary receptions, in French bourgeois families, in peasant families, on trains, the mood suddenly erupted as soon as the possibility of a new war was mentioned.
    A seventy-year-old janitor in the building where I lived asked me: "France has been drained by two world wars and ravaged by five years of Nazi occupation. What did we get from the war in North Africa? My father died in the war of 1870, my husband died in the war of 1917, and my son died in the last war. What did I get? Only the wealthy 'colonial groups' benefited from the war in North Africa. For us, prices have risen. My daughter and her husband can't find a room and have to live with their children in a hotel room, and the hotel owner charges a lot of rent because the government spends trillions of francs on war and doesn't spend enough money on housing. At least let my grandchildren have peace. Enough blood has been shed to win peace for them." She turned around and walked quickly into her room, so that I wouldn't see her cry.
    In small villages, as in large cities in France, I have seen many large-scale demonstrations demanding an end to colonial wars. The French army, sent to Algeria, mutinied en masse, blocking trains and destroying transportation. The stations where military trains departed were surrounded by large crowds to prevent military vehicles from moving. There is an active fascist element, which is not large, but when it attacks democratic forces, the police turn a blind eye.
    The same is true in the Netherlands. Six years ago, the masses protested against sending troops to Indonesia. Boys refused to board ships. New recruits and demonstrators were imprisoned. The struggle has never stopped.
    West German students had long ago decided that good statements alone were not enough, that action had to be included. As a result, there were large demonstrations against the plan to remilitarize Germany. The movement is still going on, with recent demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of American troops, because murders, rapes, and thefts often occur in the centers occupied by American troops.
    The vast majority of politically backward and ideologically poisoned American troops cannot even vaguely understand what is happening. As one of them said to me in a French cafe: "They told us to go home, we were sent here to protect the people from communist enslavement! But when we came here, we found that the people hate us even more than they hate the 'communists'. In the United States, we hear about the threat of Red China twenty-four hours a day. But in Paris, Rome, London and a dozen other cities, people are mesmerized by Chinese Peking opera. Our congressmen tell us about the nightmare of Russia dropping bombs on us, but everywhere we go in Europe, there seem to be hordes of Russian tourists. What does that mean?"
    I told him in monosyllables what "that means". I am sure he will not believe me. But when we nodded goodbye to each other, it seemed that he was thinking.
    People hear the same desire for peace expressed in different languages. In Switzerland, I met two wealthy Greeks who told me that the current so-called "defense" policy imposed by the United States corrupted Greece, insulted her national aspirations, and drove her deeper into poverty and unemployment.
    They said: "War will destroy us all together. We need peace and friendship with all countries to restore our country."
    Compared with other belligerent countries, the two world wars had a relatively lighter impact on Britain. But, despite their imperialism and their wealth from the exploitation of colonies, the people are becoming more and more aware. The current protests may finally lead to action. Even in the minds of conservatives, there is a growing perception that the presence of so many American atomic bomber bases on British soil means that they will be the first to suffer in any future war.
    The war in Malaya, the suppression of the national movement in British Guiana, and the start of military occupation of Kenya and Cyprus have not caused as widespread and active protests as in France and the Netherlands, but the scope of verbal protests is expanding.
    My guide asked me: "What did I get in Africa for four years? A leg injury, no pension, living in a damp basement, prices are often higher than my wages, and there is a constant threat of being drafted again. Thank God, I don't want war!"
    The housekeeper stopped cleaning my room, leaned on her broom, and listened to the radio news, which reported the threat of a new war.
    When I turned off the radio, she said: "After suffering the hardships of the last war, if there is another war, I will throw myself into the river."
    The owner of a beautiful country house I was visiting looked at the sky sadly as giant bombers roared towards the base a few miles away and said, "My ancestors have lived here for three hundred years, and now I am afraid I will have to sell this house, because there is no peace day or night, and the American army has made this area uninhabitable."
    I kept silent, wanting to hear what a conservative landlord was thinking.
    He continued: "I participated in both world wars; I never thought I would see the day when I could not walk on the common land because a foreign flag was flying on it." I don't think he would understand why all this happened, but as a Briton, his patriotism was deeply wounded. He said: "This kind of thing makes me think that there is something wrong with our policies."
    A few nights before leaving London, I talked to a Nigerian friend, who told me that even conservative Nigerians are gradually reaching the same conclusion, seeing that their hope for complete national independence is being frustrated by colonialism, which often continues to exist under different names, and often resorts to armed terror when the people's demands become more resolute.
    He said: "Our people only ask for the freedom and peace to create their own future, and the money that was taken from us in the form of our natural wealth in the past and the billions of pounds wasted on 'defense' is enough to give us the schools needed to educate 94% of our children. They have no schools to go to."
    My friends in New York, the Midwest, and California are all saying the same thing in their letters. They are surprisingly naive. They elected Eisenhower because he promised them peace in Korea. Then they found a Secretary of State who wanted to bring the world to the "brink of war". They are heavily taxed to defend themselves against the fictitious Russian aggression. But the Soviet Union insists on banning nuclear war, stopping nuclear testing, and proposes signing a non-aggression pact.
    An American woman said to me: "We experienced bad times during the depression of the 1930s. I had only been married for a short time when my husband joined the Pacific War. Now my son is sixteen years old, and I live in fear that he will be drafted into another war. Why can't you understand that we crave peace just as much as you do?"
    The American Gallup poll proves that the vast majority of people are in favor of negotiations. An American university lecturer asked me: "Tell me the truth about China." Many, many letters from all over the world make the same request to me.
    While writing this article, I think of my friends all over the globe. Their faces flash before me like a movie. My Australian friends wrote: "Our National Peace Congress was a great achievement. Thousands of delegates came from all over Australia and New Zealand, representing all walks of life." The charming silhouette of a Ceylon woman, who said in a musical voice: "We want peace so that we can build a free, prosperous country." The dark and heroic face of a Calcutta woman, who is dedicated to the struggle for friendship between nations. The strong, proud face of a middle-class British woman, who is a dear friend of mine, who gives her time, her life, and her money to the cause of peace.
    I hear the word "peace" shouted in various languages. This is the most beautiful word in the world. Because peace means the freedom to create the world we need.

专栏：

    人民要和平
      澳大利亚作家  迪姆芙娜·古沙克
    七年来，我到过许多国家。现在，在这些危急的日子里，尽力把澳大利亚和英国、法国和意大利、非洲和美洲、西印度群岛和东方寄来的报纸和信件里所透露出来的消息凑合一起，我发现，许多政府的政策与人民的愿望是截然相反的。
    除掉好战的官方公报和侵略行为外，我常常看到南北半球和东西方的广大人民群众，他们只要和平和友谊。人们旅行的地区越广，遇到更多的遥远的国家的人民，就愈清楚地看到各处人民要求和平的一致愿望，他们知道他们从战争中只能得到悲哀和苦痛。
    像沙米维尔，他住在克里斯托贝尔·高龙，巴拿马运河西口的一对双生市镇之一。沙米维尔是个黑人，他的父亲同别人一起由牙买加来此建造巴拿马运河。他离开牙买加，是由于在那儿不能维持生活的缘故。
    “但是有什么用呢？”沙米维尔摇着一双厚大的黑手问我。“我在这儿也不能维持生活。我四十七岁了，但我还结不起婚。”
    沙米维尔不了解我为什么宁可观察这个土著城市的肮脏、拥挤的贫民区街道，而不愿在美国区的广阔而时髦的林荫道上消闲，赞美那些为美国军政官员建造的巍峨奢华的住宅。对比的悬殊像昔日的上海，也像今日的那不勒斯港。在那儿，有许多时髦的住宅建造在临海湾的陡峭的山坡上，而在不远的地方，许多那不勒斯人住在不卫生的洞穴里。那不勒斯是美国地中海舰队的基地。
    战争并不能帮助沙米维尔。虽然他得了较多的钱，但物价上涨得更高，使他的生活过得更坏。他不明白这是什么道理，但他一个开了一家很小的饭铺（在这铺子里我们吃到一顿美味的很辣的红椒辣炒肉）的巴拿马朋友，却很明白，他知道巴拿马和邻国的大多数人民为什么穷苦。我从他那儿认识巴拿马的政治。我从沙米维尔那儿知道了巴拿马人的生活，他们都是和他一样的苦。他沉思地说：“我愿有一座小屋、一个花园和足够结婚用的钱，不要打仗。”
    在牙买加，我找到一个当地的医生，他真切地知道西印度群岛为什么这样贫穷。从所有这些岛屿中（散布在加勒比海的四周的美丽的珍珠），我也看到同样的穷富对立，这种对立人们可在每个殖民地区见到。我在各处都能听到用不同方言表达沙米维尔的希望的声音。
    我遇到英属圭亚那人，他们十分清楚：只要仍居于殖民地地位，他们就希望不到繁荣与和平。
    他们说：“事物必须改变，但是是和平的和合乎宪法的改变。”
    让英国人知道，他们的军舰和运兵船开进加勒比是错了。
    危地马拉人也有同样的思想：和平地实行立宪的改变，是条道路。美国飞机运来许多乘客，这些人是杀人犯，让他们知道，他们也错了。
    可怜的沙米维尔！在石油、水果和糖垄断统治的加勒比海沿岸诸国度内的其他千百万个沙米维尔，他们只要求一座小屋、一个花园与和平。
    去年春天，当我走过罗马的街道，到处看到标语，宣告：“战争是我们买不起的奢侈品”的时候，我想起了沙米维尔。这些话是格隆基总统在访问美国时向美国国会说的。从意大利的南端到北端，我曾听到用不同方式表达这个同一的思想。
    在一个小小的渔港里，我度过了冬季，听到农民和渔夫的痛苦与真正的饥饿的故事，我现在还仿佛能看见我的朋友奥格斯图，他是一个中年男子，吃过法西斯主义的苦头，在埃塞俄比亚打过仗，当盟军反攻时曾被迫疏散，和七个孩子在山上挨过饿。美国飞机把村庄炸成平地。如今，十二年过去了，可是农民还是住在茅舍里，因为正在建筑的屋子对他们说来是太昂贵了。
    一天下午，奥格斯图看着一队意大利战斗机从高空飞过，说：“啊！战争准备很充分，然而我们所需要的仅仅是吃得饱和过和平的生活。”
    被霜雪冻坏了早秋作物的农民跑来跟我说：“我们能怎么移民呢？这儿连吃的都没有。”
    这是千真万确的，但是这并不能阻止意大利警察开枪射击两个农民，当他们和其他的人一道走向议会要求“面包和工作”的时候。
    从意大利的一端到另一端，从贫困交迫的农民到富裕的自由职业者，我从来没有听见他们当中有谁高谈战争。例外的是，只有带着憎恶的口气才会谈到战争。报纸表达了人民的愿望，用大号标题刊登教皇庇护的圣诞节祝词，他在祝词里谴责使用原子武器。二十年的法西斯压迫，三年的纳粹占领，永远存在的二百万失业人口（在冬季增加为四百五十万），除了指望和平与和平带来的贸易之外，意大利再没有任何希望了。
    在法国，我和各种类型、各种宗教信仰的家庭共住过。越南战争期间，我还在法国，任何时候，除了“肮脏的战争”之外，我没有听到别的话。
    当法国议会第二次辩论重新武装德国问题的时候，我看到人民从法国的四面八方涌入巴黎。他们成群地来：从工厂里来，从学校里来，从铁路城镇里来，从大学里来，从农庄里来。他们成双成对地来；他们千百个一齐来。有儿子在反纳粹主义的战斗中牺牲了的妇女；有千万个在抗战中丧失了丈夫的寡妇；有儿子和丈夫死在德国集中营和毒气室里的双亲和妻子。在12月的刺骨的寒风中，在雨雪的淋打下，群众聚在议会大厦外面，从清晨直到深夜。他们无尽地排着队伍，以便会见他们的议员。
    最后，在英美的不可容忍的压力下通过重新武装西德的法案的时候，众多的警察部队完全包围了议会大厦。在到飞机场去的路上，我问出租汽车的司机：“为什么？”他说：“他们害怕了；他们知道人民不要战争，而一个重新武装起来的德国就意味着战争。”
    从法国的一端到另一端都涂着这样的标语：“美国佬滚回去”。当一个美国朋友（他是个自由主义的美国人）走进旅馆里他自己的房间时，他的手提箱也插上了小旗，上面写着同样的标语。这个标语还时常伴随着另一个标语：“打倒战争”。
    在文艺欢迎会上，在法国资产阶级的家庭里，在农民的家庭里，在火车里，一旦提起了新战争的可能性的当儿，人们的情绪便猝然迸发。
    我居住的楼房的一位七十岁的看楼的老太婆问我：“法国在两次大战中被弄得骨枯髓干，又被五年的纳粹占领蹂躏过。在北非的战争中，我们得到了些什么？我的父亲死于1870年的战争中，丈夫死于1917年的战争中，儿子死于上次战争中。我得到过什么呢？在北非战争中得利的只是富裕的‘殖民集团’。对我们来说，物价是上涨了。我的女儿和她的丈夫找不到一间屋子，只好和他们的孩子住在旅馆的房间里，旅馆主人收很贵的租金，这是由于政府在战争上花费千万亿法郎，而在房屋上没有用足够的钱。至少让我的孙儿孙女们得到和平吧。所流的血已够为他们取得和平了。”她掉转身来，快步走进她的房间，免得我看到她流泪。
    在小村落里，跟在法国的大城市里一样，我曾看到许多浩浩荡荡的示威游行，要求停止殖民战争。被派往阿尔及利亚去的法国军队，大批地暴动了，阻止火车，捣毁交通，那些开出军队列车的车站被广大的人群包围了，阻止军车开动。有一股活跃的法西斯分子，这股人虽然不多，但当它攻击民主力量的时候，警察却掉头不管。
    在荷兰也是这样。六年以前群众曾经抗议派遣军队到印度尼西亚去。男孩子们拒绝上船。新兵和游行示威的人被监禁了。斗争却从未停止过。
    西德学生早就议决：光是很好的声明是不够的，必须包括行动才行。因此出现了反对重新把德国军事化的计划的大示威。运动还在继续中，最近的几次示威，要求美国军队撤走，因为在美军占领的中心地经常发生谋杀、强奸和偷窃案。
    绝大部分政治落后、思想被毒化了的美国军队甚至还不能蒙胧地了解到发生了什么事。正如他们中的一个人在一家法国咖啡馆里对我所说的：“他们叫我们回家，我们是被派遣到这儿来保护人民免受共产主义奴役的啊！但是，当我们来到这里，我们发现人民憎恨我们更甚于憎恨‘共产党人’。在美国，一天二十四小时我们都听到红色中国的威胁。但是，在巴黎、罗马、伦敦和十多个其他城市里，对中国京剧都着魔了。我们的议员告诉我们关于俄国要向我们扔炸弹的恶梦，但是我们所到的欧洲任何地方，都似乎有成群结队的俄国旅行家。你说，那是什么意思？”
    我用单音字告诉他，“那种意思”是什么。我确信他不会相信我。但当我们互相点头告别的时候，看来他是在思索了。
    人们听到用不同的语言表达同样渴望和平的心情。我在瑞士遇到两个富裕的希腊人，他们对我说，现行的美国所强加的所谓“防御”政策败坏了希腊，污辱她的民族愿望，驱使她日益深陷入贫穷和失业中。
    他们说：“战争将把我们一起毁灭掉。我们需要同一切国家和平和友好，以恢复我们的国家。”
    和其他参战国比起来，两次世界大战对英国的影响都比较轻。但是，尽管他们是帝国主义和他们的财富来自对殖民地的剥削，老百姓却越来越清醒了。从现在的抗议可能终于导致行动。甚至在保守的人的意识中，也逐渐有这种看法：在英国的土地上出现这许多美国原子轰炸机基地，意味着在未来的任何战争中，他们将是首先遭殃的国家。
    马来亚的战争、对英属圭亚那的民族运动的镇压和对怯尼亚与塞浦路斯军事占领的开始，并没有引起像在法国和荷兰那样的广泛的积极的抗议，但口头抗议的范围正在扩大。
    我的向导人问我：“我在非洲四年，得到什么呢？腿上负了伤，没有抚恤金，住在一个阴湿的地下室里，物价常常高于我的工资，还有再被征入伍的经常威胁。谢天谢地，我不要战争！”
    女管家在打扫我的房间时停下来，靠在扫帚上，倾听无线电广播新闻，新闻里报告新战争的威胁。
    当我关上无线电时，她说：“我经过上次大战的苦难以后，假如再来一次战争，我将投河自尽。”
    我正在拜访的一所美丽的乡间房屋的居住主人，当巨型的轰炸机怒吼着飞向数哩外的基地上去的时候，他望着空中沉痛地说道：“我的祖宗在这儿居住达三百年，而现在我怕要卖掉这所屋子了，因为日夜都没有安宁，美国军队已经使这个区域成为不适于居住的地方了。”
    我不作声，要听听一个保守的地主在想些什么。
    他继续说：“两次大战我都参加过；我从来没有想过我将会看到这样的一天：我竟不能在公地上行走，因为它上面飘扬了一面外国旗。”我不以为他会了解为什么会发生这一切，但作为一个英国人，他的爱国心是被深深地损害了。他说：“这种事情使我想到：我们的政策当中有不对头的地方。”
    在离开伦敦的前几夜，我跟一个尼日利亚朋友谈话，他对我说，甚至保守的尼日利亚人也逐渐达到同样的结论，他们看到他们的彻底的民族独立的希望正受到殖民主义的挫折，这种殖民主义在不同的名义下常常继续保存下来，而且常常当人民的要求愈坚决的时候借助于武力恐怖。
    他说：“我们的人民只要求有创造自己的未来的自由与和平，而过去以我们的天然财富的形式夺去的我们的钱和浪费在‘防御’上的亿万镑，足使我们有教育我们94％的儿童所需的学校。他们没有学校可进。”
    我的在纽约、中西部和加利福尼亚的朋友，在他们的信里说的都是同样的话。他们天真得令人出奇。他们之所以选举艾森豪威尔，是因为他答应他们在朝鲜实现和平。然后他们发现有个国务卿，他要使世界濒于“战争的边缘”上。他们被课以重税，以保卫他们自己免受虚构的俄国侵略。而苏联却坚持：禁止核子战争、停止核子试验，并建议签订互不侵犯公约。
    一位美国妇女对我说：“在萧条期间的三十年代，我们经历过恶劣的时候。我的丈夫参加太平洋战争的时候，我才结婚不久。现在我的儿子已十六岁了，而我生活在恐惧之中，怕他被征入伍参加另一次战争。为什么你会不了解我们和你们同样地渴望和平呢？”
    美国的盖洛普民意测验证明了，绝大多数人赞成谈判。一位美国大学讲师要求我：“把中国的真实情况告诉我吧。”从世界各地寄来许许多多的信件，向我作同样的请求。
    在写这篇文章的时候，我想起了地球各处的朋友们。他们的面孔像电影一样连续闪现在我面前。我的澳大利亚朋友们写道：“我们的全国和平大会是一大成就。上千名代表来自全澳大利亚和新西兰，代表了社会各阶层。”一位锡兰妇女的迷人的侧影，她用音乐般的声音说：“我们要和平，这样我们才能建设一个自由、繁荣的国家。”一位加尔各答妇女的黝黑而英气勃勃的面孔，她献身于为各民族之间的友谊而奋斗的斗争。一位中产阶级的英国妇女的强壮、骄傲的脸庞，她是我亲爱的朋友，她把她的时间、她的生命和她的金钱都贡献给和平事业。
    我听见用各种语言呼喊“和平”这个词儿。这是世界上最美的一个词儿。因为和平意味着缔造一个我们所需要的世界的自由。
