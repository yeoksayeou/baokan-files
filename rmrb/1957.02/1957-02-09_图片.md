    Ruili County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, borders the Union of Myanmar to the south. The clear Ruili River flows between villages in China and Myanmar. Residents of both countries drink from the same river. This is a scene of Dai girls from Hexian Village in our country and Shan girls from the neighboring Dazhang Village in Myanmar drawing water together.
