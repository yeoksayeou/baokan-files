    Thoughts After Seeing Northern Kunqu Opera
    Yu Pingbo
    Some time ago, I watched the report performance of the Northern Kunqu Opera Troupe in Beijing. Han Shichang, Bai Yunsheng, Hou Yongkui, Ma Xianglin, Hou Yushan and others all have profound skills and performed very seriously; the performances of young students were also remarkable. I would like to wish them success in their public performances. Regarding the future development of Kunqu Opera and how our Kunqu Opera circles should unite, I also have some personal opinions, which I write down for everyone's consideration.
    The terms "Kunqu Opera," "Kunqiang," and "Kunju" have a point that easily leads to misunderstandings: since it is called Kunshanqiang, then it is a local opera; Kunshan is in Jiangnan, so how can there be any Northern Kunqu Opera! To explain this misunderstanding, first, we must explore the origin of Kunqu Opera and its various relationships with Chinese music and drama since the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties; second, we must examine the distribution and development history of Kunqu Opera throughout the country in the four hundred years since Wei Liangfu created the tune in the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. This is a matter for specialized treatises or books, which cannot be explained clearly in a few words here. We might as well talk about the current situation roughly.
    Leaving aside its myriad and still-connected relationships with the grand suites and variety plays of the Tang and Song dynasties, the zhugongdiao of the Jin dynasty, the northern tunes of the Yuan dynasty, and the southern tunes of the Yuan and Ming dynasties, if we look at the actual situation today, we will know that Kunqu Opera is by no means just a local tune. It synthesizes and develops various schools of "Southern Tunes," and in the late Ming Dynasty, it also incorporated the stringed music tunes of the North (i.e., a branch of "Northern Tunes"). Kunqu Opera is also by no means a local opera. Not only does Beijing have its Kunqu Opera, but Gaoyang in Hebei has its Kunqu Opera, and other regions such as Hunan and Yunnan also have their own Kunqu Opera. Kunqu Opera is basically one, but it has various schools, such as Jingkun, Beikun, Xiangkun, and Diankun. These schools are not sects and should not establish their own separate portals and exclude each other; on the contrary, they are showing a flourishing scene of letting a hundred flowers bloom in the Kunqu Opera family. If we think that only Kunqu Opera in the Suzhou area, or more broadly, in the "Su-Song-Tai-Hang-Jia-Hu" area, is the real old brand, then we are ignoring historical facts, sealing ourselves off, limiting ourselves, and downgrading Kunqu Opera, which used to be popular throughout the country, to a local opera. Of course, on the other hand, how to preserve the Kunqu Opera tradition with more of the "water-grinding tune" created by Wei Liangfu in the Ming Dynasty is also very important.
    To be more specific, in terms of repertoire, some repertoires no longer exist in Jiangnan, but are still preserved in other regions of the country. Not long ago, at the Shanghai performance, Northern Kunqu Opera had some that the South did not, especially martial arts plays. We used to call Kunqu Opera "civilian plays," but in fact Kunqu Opera is a genre that combines both civil and martial arts, singing and acting, not only slow singing and dancing, but also able to sing慷慨悲歌, and has very fiery martial arts scenes. It was not only appreciated by the scholars of the past, but also loved by the vast number of farmers. Its performance is sometimes "too refined," and those who do not like Kunqu Opera say it is "too dull," but it can also be changed appropriately. For example, in the report performance, there was "The Peony Pavilion"'s "Picking Up the Painting and Crying Out." This is a calm "one-man show," which is most likely to sing "dull," but Mr. Bai Yunsheng's performance of this play was lively and vivid. The audience was very welcoming and did not feel bored. We should make Kunqu Opera appropriately popular on the basis of preserving the original excellent traditions. We must strive for more audiences and expand its social influence so that Kunqu Opera can have a new life.
    The close coordination between pronunciation and musical notation is a characteristic of Kunqu Opera. Let's look at it from the perspective that pronunciation should be accurate. Since Kunqu Opera inherits the tradition of the Jin and Yuan dynasties, the pronunciation used should not be biased towards the South. However, since "grinding tunes" originated and became popular in Jiangnan, and most of the singers were from the South, the pronunciation naturally leaned towards the South. Strictly speaking, it is not right for Southerners to sing Kunqu Opera in their local accents, and of course it is not right to use Northern local accents either. Experts in opera studies in the Ming Dynasty often had the saying of correcting the errors of Wu pronunciation. For example, Shen Chongshui's "Must-Know for Tuning Melodies" says: "The three tones of level, rising, and departing are eight or nine out of ten the same in northern and southern tunes, and the only difference is the entering tone." We don't necessarily have to agree with these experts' advocacy of restoring the ancient ways, but it is a misunderstanding to say that Southern pronunciation is all correct and Northern pronunciation is all wrong. To ask Northerners to learn Suzhou dialect first before singing Kunqu Opera, how can that be reasonable. Kunqu Opera's pronunciation has its own set of formal, traditional, and customary pronunciations, and whether it needs to be changed involves a wide range of issues, which will not be discussed in detail here.
    Kunqu Opera is not limited to a certain region, as can be understood from the above statement. Following the joint performance of Northern and Southern Kunqu Operas, the capital will also establish a Kunqu Opera institution, which will make it a truly national classical drama. I have infinite optimistic hopes for this unprecedented event, and at the same time, I feel that this work is very arduous. After the mid-Qing Dynasty, Kunqu Opera experienced a long period of decline, and we should be very vigilant and take it as a lesson from the past. How to improve and how to remedy it requires everyone to discuss it together. One thing seems certain: without reform, there will be no future, not only will there be no development, but there will be no preservation. "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is a good example.
    How to carry out reform is a major issue at present. Reform cannot be achieved in one step and must be done in stages. The so-called steps, first of all, is to understand the situation. The so-called situation is not only in books, but on the stage (including on the music stage). People who can sing and perform must sing and perform more so that everyone can listen and see what it is like. I often feel that tunes are somewhat different from poems and lyrics. They must be sung and performed to become vivid, lively, and full. Just looking at them in books, sometimes you feel that the tunes are not as well written as the poems and lyrics. This may be my personal feeling, but I don't know if everyone else feels the same. For example, "The Story of the Pipa," after singing and performing, it feels even more purely descriptive, and its profoundness is unmatched. Another example is "Meeting at a Single Knife," which, after singing and performing, makes everyone appreciate its magnificence, unrestrainedness, and thoroughness even more. To give another example from my feelings after watching the "Northern Kunqu" performance, "The Journey to the West"'s "Fat Girl," I am not familiar with it, I have heard it in music gatherings, and my impression is not deep, and it doesn't seem to have anything particularly good about it. Recently, after watching Mr. Han Shichang's performance, I realized that this script is really well written and can express the innocent and childlike spirit of rural girls. The lyrics seem to be flat when read, but after the performance on the stage, they stand out. How many levels are there, how many tendons and joints are there, the stiff words become active. What was originally flat is now transformed into three-dimensional; what was originally like a slide projector is now like a sound film. The benefits of a tune cannot be fully understood by reading it alone, it must be sung; singing is not enough, sometimes it must be acted out. Through practice on the stage, one can truly determine the merits of a script. On the one hand, I hope that the artists will perform more for us, and on the other hand, I also hope that the leading comrades in charge of culture will give them more opportunities to perform, increase the public's understanding of Kunqu Opera, and give it a correct judgment.
    How to sing and perform? I think it is appropriate to perform according to the original performance method first, and some can be used as internal viewing programs. If there are revised versions, the original versions should not be completely abandoned. Even with the "Fifteen Strings of Cash," which is famous for its successful reform, it is right to change the two clues of "Double Bears" into one, but the original "Fifteen Strings of Cash" "Male Prison" scene, which writes about the encounter of brothers in distress, is very tragic and moving. Also, in the original "Seeing the Capital" scene, the prefect beats the drum, and the governor has no choice but to ascend to the hall to receive him, and the atmosphere is tense; in the revised version, after beating the drum, he waits for a long time in the study, which, although deeply satirizes the big bureaucrats, does not quite conform to the actual situation that may have existed at that time. As for casually "simplifying" the original wonderful scenes, that is even more inappropriate. For example, the People's Daily on January 26th reported that the initial revised version of the Sichuan Opera "The Story of the Maiden's Chamber" simply deleted the scene of lodging in a hotel. If the person who organized this script at that time had referred to Kunqu Opera, he would have known that "Inviting Merchants to Perform" is the most widely circulated scene in Kunqu Opera's "The Story of the Maiden's Chamber," and he would not have easily crossed it out. The reform of Kunqu Opera is very important, but it should be appropriately combined with preservation. The purpose of reform is to remove the dross and retain the essence so that the masses can better accept it.
    This time I watched Mr. Han Shichang perform "Dreaming" in "The Peony Pavilion," and it goes without saying how good his body movements and expressions were. He performed according to the "old way," and the shallow passage where the dream god appeared was not deleted, which I think is right. Because with the appearance of the dream god, the boundary between awakening and dreaming is clearly defined. Otherwise, the encounter between Du and Liu would not be clear, making it easy for the audience to be confused. Moreover, the old man of the dream god entices Liu Mengmei to come out, so that he slowly meets Du Liniang, and then he slips away, and his body movements and expressions are very interesting, and it is a pity to delete it. The reason for advocating the deletion of this passage, if it lies in breaking superstition; then, is the flower god not superstition, why not delete it?
    I am not saying that "Dreaming" cannot be changed at all. In fact, the "Pile of Flowers" scene is not originally from Tang Ruoshi's original work, but was added later. As long as it is added well, why not? The "Pile of Flowers" section uses the bright sunshine, colorful scene to render the love of young men and women, which is both beautiful and solemn, and can express the confusion of the dream. Using these two simple examples of the dream god and the flower god in "Dreaming," it shows that adding can be added, deleting can be deleted, and changing can be changed, as long as the change is good. Who wants to change it for the better, who wants to change it for the worse? The important thing is whether the objective effect can match the subjective intention. The empty thoughts in the scholar's study are corrected by the practice on the stage; the adaptation of the script is made more complete by referring to the results of research. This can avoid the two deviations of "remaining unchanged" and "arbitrary tampering."
    In general, Kunqu Opera is a comprehensive art. In the cultural heritage of the motherland, it is one of the most extensive and richest comprehensive arts. We can approach it from various different angles: such as music theory and performance, literature, literary history, language and phonology, drama, and dance. To find such a versatile opera scholar, there has not been one in the past, and I am afraid there will not be one in the future. Therefore, we can only rely on the wisdom of the masses and give play to the strength of the collective. Kunqu Opera groups all over the country need to unite, and the broad Kunqu Opera circles should also unite.

    看了北方昆剧的感想
    俞平伯
    我前些日子看了北方昆曲代表团在北京的汇报演出，有韩世昌、白云生、侯永奎、马祥麟、侯玉山和其他各位，他们都工力深厚，演得很认真；又青年学生的演奏，成绩也斐然可观。我对北方昆剧家的公开演出，在这里预祝他们的成功。关于昆剧发展的前途和我们昆曲界怎样结合，也有一点个人的看法，写下来请大家指正。
    “昆曲”、“昆腔”、“昆剧”这些名词，有一个容易引人误会之点：既名昆山腔，那就是地方戏；昆山在江南，又哪里有什么北方昆剧呢！要解释这个误会，第一必须寻讨昆曲的渊源，它跟唐宋元明以来，中国音乐戏剧的种种关系；第二必须考查自明嘉靖魏良辅创调后，四百年间在全国范围内，昆剧分布的情况，发展的历史。这是专门论著或专书的事，决非这里三言两语所能够说得明白的。我们不妨就目前的实况粗略地一谈。
    它跟唐宋的大曲杂剧，金的诸宫调，元的北曲，元明的南曲这些千丝万缕似断仍连的关系，放着不谈，即看今日实际的情况，便知道昆曲决非仅仅一地方的曲调，它综合“南曲”各派而加以发展，在明朝末年又把北方的弦索调（即“北曲”的支流）归并了去。昆剧也决非地方戏，不但北京有它的昆剧，河北高阳有它的昆剧，即其他地区如湖南、云南也各有它的昆剧。昆剧基本上只是一个，却有各种流派，如京昆、北昆、湘昆、滇昆。这些流派并非宗派，并不该各立门户互相排斥；相反的，在昆曲的大家庭里正呈显着百花齐放的盛况。我们若认为只有苏州一带的，或者稍广一些，“苏松太杭嘉湖”一带地区的昆剧才是真正的老牌，那就忽略了历史的事实，把自己给封锁住，局限住，而把曾经通行全国的昆剧贬降为地方戏了。当然，另一方面，怎样保存明代魏良辅创始的“水磨调”较多的昆曲传统，也是非常重要的。
    再具体一点，就剧目说，有些剧目在江南已经没有了，却在全国其他地区还保存着。不久以前在上海会演，北方昆戏有一些南方没有的，特别是武戏。我们从前把昆剧叫做“文班戏”，其实昆剧是文武兼备，连唱带做的剧种，不只缓歌曼舞，也能够慷慨悲歌，起打火炽。它不但为过去文士们所欣赏，而且曾为广大的农民们所喜爱。它的表演，有时“太文”，不喜欢昆曲的就说它“太瘟”，却亦未尝不可相当地改变。如那次汇报演出，其中有“牡丹亭”的“拾画叫画”。这是冷静的“独脚戏”，最容易唱“瘟”了，而白云生先生演这个戏却生动活泼。听众很欢迎，不觉得沉闷。我们应该在保存原来的优秀传统的基础上，使昆戏相当的通俗化。我们必须争取更多的观众，扩大社会上的影响，昆剧才能有新的生命。
    字音跟工谱密切配合是昆曲的一个特点，我们试从字音应该准确这个角度来看。昆曲既上承金元的传统，所用字音本不应偏于南。但“磨调”既产生、通行于江南，唱曲的南人居多，则字音自然而然地偏南了。正规地说，南人用土音来唱昆曲并不对，用北方土音当然也不对。明代的曲学专家每有正吴音之讹的说法。如沈宠绥“度曲须知”曰：“平上去三声南北曲十同八九，其迥异者入声字面。”我们正不必一定赞成这些专家复古的说法，但南音都对北音全讹，却是误解。要北方人先学会了苏州话再来唱昆曲，试想哪有这个情理。昆曲的字音，自有它一套正规、传统、习惯的念法，是否需要改变，牵涉很广，这里不及详论了。
    昆剧并不局限于某一地方，从上边的说法即可明白。继南北昆剧会演之后，首都又将有昆剧机构之建立，将使它成为名副其实的全国性的古典戏剧。对这空前的盛举，我抱着无限乐观的希望，同时又感到这工作非常艰巨。在清代中叶以后，昆曲曾有过一段长时间的衰落，我们自当十分警惕，引为前车之鉴。怎样改进、怎样补救，需要大家来共同商讨。有一点似乎可以确定的：若不经过改革，便不会有前途，非但谈不到发展，并且谈不到保存。“十五贯”便是个很好的范例。
    怎样进行改革，是目前一个主要的课题。改革不可能一步做到，必须有步骤。所谓步骤，首先要了解情况。所谓情况，不只是书本上的，而是戏台上的（也包括曲台上的），会唱会演的人必须多唱多演，给大家听听看看到底怎么样。我常觉得曲子跟诗词有些不同，它必须经过唱演才生动起来，活泼起来，饱满起来。仅从书本上看，有时会觉得曲子写得不如诗词。这或者是我个人的感觉，却不知大家亦有同感否。譬如“琵琶记”，经过唱演更觉得它纯用白描，深厚处不可及。又如“单刀会”，也因经过唱演，大家更体会到它的雄浑潇洒，痛快淋漓。再举我看了“北昆”演出所感到的一个实例。“西游记”的“胖姑”，我对它不熟悉，在曲会里听过，印象也不深，似乎没有什么特别的好处。最近看了韩世昌先生的演出，方才觉得这剧本真写得好，能表达出乡村女孩子一片天真烂缦的神情。曲文读来好像平平的一片，经过舞台上的表演，便显得突出了。有多少层次，有多少筋节，呆板的文词便活跃起来。原来平面的，现在化为立体；原来像只幻灯，现在却像有声电影了。曲子的好处不单靠诵读就能够了然的，必须要歌唱；歌唱还不够，有时还必须扮演。通过舞台上的实践，才能真正地决定一出剧本的好坏。我一方面盼望艺术家们为我们多上演，另一方面也盼望主持文化的领导同志们多给他们演唱的机会，增进群众对昆剧的了解，给它以正确的评判。
    怎样演唱？我以为宜先照原来的演法上演，有些可作为内部观摩的节目。有了改本的，原本亦不可全废。即以改革得成功而出名的“十五贯”而论，将“双熊”的两条线索改为一条是对的，但原本十五贯“男监”一场写兄弟落难相逢，非常凄惨动人。又原本“见都”一场，太守击鼓，巡抚不得已升大堂接见，空气紧张；改本的写法，击鼓以后，在书房内待之良久，虽深刻地讽刺了大官僚，却跟那时可能有的实际情况有些不合。至于随便把原本精彩的场面给“精简”了去，那更不妥。如1月26日人民日报载川剧“幽闺记”的初次改本，把投宿旅店一场干脆删掉了。假如当时整理这剧本的人曾参考过昆曲，便知“招商串戏”为昆剧“幽闺记”流传最广的一折，就不至于把它轻易勾消了。昆剧的改革固十分重要，却应该适当地和保存相结合。改革的目的原为去其糟粕，留其精华，使群众能够更好地接受它。
    这次看了韩世昌先生演牡丹亭“惊梦”，身段神情之好固不待言。他按着“老路子”演，浅显的如梦神出场一段便没有删去，我认为是对的。因有了梦神出场，就划清了醒梦的界限。否则杜柳二人相逢，便交代不清楚，使观者容易迷惑。而且梦神那个老头儿逗引柳梦梅出来，使他慢慢地和杜丽娘会面，后来他就溜了，身段神态都很有趣，删了未免可惜。主张删去这一段的理由，假如在于破除迷信；那么，花神难道不是迷信，为什么又不删呢？
    我并不说“惊梦”全不能改。事实上“堆花”一场，已非汤若士原本所有，本来是后添的。只要添得好，又何尝不可呢。“堆花”这一段，用艳阳天气万紫千红的场面渲染出青年男女的恋爱，既美丽，又庄严，且能表现出梦境的迷离惝恍来。借这“惊梦”中梦神花神两桩简单的事例，就说明了增也可增，删也可删，改是可以改，只要改得好就行。谁都想改好，谁想改坏呢？重要的是，客观上的效果能否符合主观上的企图。文人书房里的空想，从舞台上的实践而得到纠正；剧本的改编亦因参照了研究的成果而更加圆满。这样就可以避免“原封不动”和“任意妄改”的两种偏差。
    总的说来昆曲是综合的艺术。在祖国的文化遗产里，它是最广泛、最丰富的综合艺术之一。我们可以从各个不同的角度去接近它：如音乐原理演奏方面、文学方面、文学史方面、语言音韵方面、戏剧方面、舞蹈方面。要觅这样全才的曲学家，以前固不曾有，以后怕也不会有。因此我们只能依靠群众的智慧，发挥集体的力量。全国各地的昆剧团体需要团结起来，即广大的昆曲界也应该团结起来。
