    Encouraging Reclamation Pioneers to Build Happy Homes on Wasteland:
    Shandong Province Properly Takes Care of Immigrant Families

    (Our report) Jinan - Shandong Province's nearly 400,000 family members of volunteer reclamation pioneers have generally received warm care and attention from local governments, Party committees, and agricultural cooperatives.

    In early spring last year, 100,000 young and middle-aged volunteers from Shandong Province went to Heilongjiang Province to reclaim wasteland. To ensure they could focus on building new homes, over the past year, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee not only issued multiple instructions to do a good job in supporting the families of immigrants, but also convened special meetings and sent cadres deep into the grassroots to inspect and arrange work related to immigrant families.

    Under the direct leadership of local Party committees and governments, agricultural production cooperatives everywhere have arranged production for immigrant families household by household and person by person, according to their labor capacity. For example, Chengwu County arranged fixed farm work for 290 households with labor power, and also helped arrange temporary production for more than 80 households with weaker labor power. In Teng County, immigrant families, regardless of their labor strength, all had work to do. To accommodate women with children in participating in production, many agricultural cooperatives specially established and expanded nurseries. The families' enthusiasm for labor is very high.

    Agricultural cooperatives also paid attention to helping solve the special difficulties of immigrant families. For example, in Dianzi Township, Ju County, seven families had leaky roofs. After the agricultural cooperative learned about this, it immediately provided 2,200 catties of straw to help repair them. Dong'e County helped 63 families repair 271 rooms. When Liu Chuanda, a reclamation pioneer in Sangjiagou Village, Ju County, had a baby, the agricultural cooperative assigned a female member to specifically help her fetch water, cook, and do chores. When Wang Shutong's mother, a reclamation pioneer in Lizhuang Township, Shen County, fell ill, the township People's Committee quickly introduced her to the clinic for treatment, and township cadres often visited to take care of her, sometimes even preparing the medicine themselves. In the summer harvest pre-distribution, appropriate consideration was given to families lacking labor. In Zhongcun Town, Pingyi County, 81 families received mutual aid from cooperative members and government relief funds totaling 8,879 yuan, 2,400 catties of grain and sweet potato strips, and 1,700 catties of firewood. Since the beginning of winter, the Shandong Provincial People's Committee has allocated an additional special fund of 740,000 yuan to help immigrant families solve difficulties in life such as food rations and cotton clothing and bedding.

    The families of the reclamation pioneers were deeply moved by the meticulous care and attention from the Party, the government, and the agricultural cooperatives. They often wrote letters to tell their loved ones about the production and living conditions at home, and encouraged them to participate in reclamation production with peace of mind. Old man Guo Ximing said in a letter to his son: "Our family has no difficulties in life at all. You don't have to worry about anything. Build our new hometown well and strive to move the whole family there as soon as possible." These were a great encouragement to the reclamation pioneers. They often wrote back expressing their determination: "We must build a happy home on the wasteland and produce more grain for the motherland." (Gu Fei)

    鼓励垦荒者在荒地上建立幸福家园
    山东省妥善照顾移民家属
    本报讯　山东省志愿垦荒者的近四十万名家属，普遍得到当地政府、党委、农业社的热情关怀和照顾。
    去年春初，山东省有十万名青壮年志愿垦荒者到黑龙江省去开荒。为了使他们安心建设新的家园，近一年来，中共山东省委、山东省人民委员会除多次发出做好移民家属工作的指示外，并召开专门会议，派出干部深入基层，检查和布置移民家属工作。
    各地农业生产合作社在当地党委、政府直接领导下，都按照移民家属的劳动力情况，逐户逐人地安排了他们的生产。例如，城武县对二百九十户有劳动力的家属安排了固定农活，对八十多户劳动力较弱的家属，也都帮助他们安排了临时生产。滕县的移民家属不论劳动力强弱，都有活可作。为了照顾有小孩的妇女参加生产，许多农业社特地举办和扩大了托儿所。家属们的劳动情绪很高。
    对移民家属的特殊困难，农业社也注意帮助解决。例如，莒县店子乡有七户家属的住房漏雨，农业社知道后，立即拿出二千二百斤草帮助补修。东阿县帮助六十三户家属修房二百七十一间。莒县桑家沟村垦荒者刘传达的老婆生孩子，农业社里指定了女社员专门帮助她打水、作饭、干些零活。莘县李庄乡垦荒者王叔同的母亲患病，乡人民委员会赶紧介绍到医务所去看病，乡干部也常去照看，有时还亲自煎药。在夏收预分当中，对缺乏劳动力的家属，都给予适当照顾。平邑县仲村镇八十一户家属，得到社员互济和政府救济款八千八百七十九元，粮食和地瓜干二千四百斤，柴一千七百斤。入冬以来，山东省人民委员会又增拨专款七十四万元，帮助移民家属解决口粮和棉衣、棉被等生活困难。
    垦荒者的家属对党和政府以及农业社的无微不至的关怀和照顾，深为感动，常常写信把家里的生产、生活状况，告诉自己的亲人，并鼓励他们安心参加垦荒生产。郭喜明老汉给儿子的信中说：“咱家生活一点也没困难，你啥也不用惦念，好好建设咱的新家乡，争取早些日子把全家搬去。”这些，对垦荒者们是很大的鼓舞。他们也常常来信表示决心：“一定要在荒地上建立起幸福的家园，为祖国增产更多的粮食。”　（顾非）
