Severe Cold Can Be Overcome
Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Liu Xiaowu

I returned from Urumqi and that same evening I heard that a drilling team leader from a worker background had trial-produced a boiler.

Just ten days before, when I left Karamay, people were still worried about this! In winter, it gets as cold as minus forty degrees here. Can we live here? Can we produce here? The brave people can only answer one way: Persist! Fight the severe cold!

If there aren't enough houses, dig cellars. If coal can't be transported, gather firewood. Without bricks or planks, people cut reeds and build walls around the drilling rigs. In a word, do everything possible.

Only one thing was most worrying: no substitute for boilers could be found.

Without boilers on the drilling rigs, the mud would freeze. Without boilers on the oil wells that were already producing, the crude oil would freeze.

Who can be blamed for this? If you have to blame someone, it can only be that Karamay was discovered too suddenly and developed too quickly. Initially, sixty-odd people and one well. And now? Across more than three thousand square kilometers, oil wells producing oil stand one after another. Drilling rigs, one after another. People, more than ten thousand already live here. In summer, when it’s so hot you can barely breathe, people thought about the boiler issue, checked the warehouse, and there were only a dozen, far from enough.

Were we really going to let the drilling machines stop, the crude oil freeze, and the enthusiastic hearts of more than ten thousand people working for national construction be buried by ice and snow?

At this crucial moment, the drilling team leader Liang Damao made a boiler himself. How exciting this is! How worthy of praise this man is!

I went to visit him.

He's not tall, nor fat, with a yellow face, looking older than his twenty-nine years; one can imagine that life has tormented him.

He narrated the process of making the boiler to me.

“The day at the end of September, I was at well number eight. Whoever sees this well likes it, it produces a lot of oil, without interruption, and the decline rate is very small. Guarding this treasure well, who wouldn't be happy. But that evening, the wind grew stronger and stronger, and the temperature dropped. Workers came down from the oil tank, facing the wind, and ran towards me, shouting:

“‘Captain, Captain, the viscosity is increasing!’

“When I heard this, my mind buzzed, as if someone had hit me with a big stone. I quickly climbed onto the oil tank, and sure enough, what the workers said was true.

“It's going to freeze! What can be done?

“That night, my heart twisted into a knot.

“That night, I didn't close my eyes, and countless ideas raced through my mind. Ask the superiors to install boilers. Without boilers, there is no need to think about production at all.

“But the next day, as soon as I entered the office, before I could even open my mouth, engineer Ren Hao greeted me first:

“‘Old Liang, come quickly, take a look at this.’

“I saw a piece of paper on the table. On the paper, there were some spiral lines, with a square box on top, and below… We are just roughnecks, unable to see the mystery within.

“Engineer Ren said: You wanted a boiler, didn’t you? The experts said: ‘The Soviets used this kind of boiler.’

“A boiler? We've used, seen, and heard of quite a few, but I couldn’t relate it to this drawing.

“Engineer Ren pointed to the square box on the drawing and said: ‘This is the water jacket,’ and pointed to the spring and said: ‘This is the coil. Using the gas spewing from the well…’

“Now I understood.

“Who knew engineer Ren would push the drawing towards me, and say: ‘The experts said: this is an intention, an inspiration. You design one for us based on this as a reference.’

“This time, I was really anxious. I said: ‘What are you doing! Engineer, what are you joking about? Who doesn’t know me? I came from the working class, with little education…’

“Engineer Ren said seriously: ‘Haven't you burned boilers before?’

“Burning boilers doesn’t necessarily mean you can design one! But engineer Ren said: ‘This is the department’s opinion, do it! If there are any difficulties, raise them, and the superiors will help you.’

“You asked me how I trial-produced the boiler? To be honest, I never thought about trial-producing a boiler. If it weren’t for the support of the superiors, and the advice of the experts, I wouldn’t even have dared to think about it.

“A task is a task, you can’t refuse it, but after I accepted it, my mind didn’t know how to use itself.”

He smiled and said: “I'm the kind of person who, once I start drilling into something, I can’t get out. First, I thought about installing a gate valve on the coil head to control the airflow, so the pipes wouldn’t freeze. Later, I thought about increasing the size of the coil, first spiral, then changed to serpentine, from one layer to four layers, five layers…

“At this time, I couldn’t even hear my wife talking to me, let alone eat.

“Later, engineer Ren and I went to see chief mechanical engineer Wang Xiangqing with the completed drawings. At first, I was afraid of him. He asked a question, and I answered one, not daring to say anything more. Gradually, I realized that this person was down-to-earth, practical, a doer, not someone who just drills into books. He pointed out many shortcomings to me, and helped me think of many solutions. I revised the drawings several times. Finally, he said, okay! Submit it to the machine repair factory. In fact, the entire boiler, except for the coil, used waste materials, and even the coil was readily available. It went smoothly, and it was out of the factory in less than a week.

“Unable to get a crane, Gou Yaobo led a dozen workers to lift the boiler onto a truck and transport it to well number eight. They rushed to install it overnight, those who were supposed to get off work didn't leave, and kept working until the water was filled, the gas was lit, and they just waited for the radiator to warm up. Who knew the water just wouldn't go into the coil. I carefully checked it over and over again, no problems. I sat there, thinking about it again and again, still no problems. But why wouldn’t the water go in? The workers were circling the boiler, touching here, touching there, if the screw wasn’t loose, they would tighten it, if there was some dust on the pipe, they would wipe it with their work clothes. Actually, it was useless.

“Suddenly, worker Yue Wenhan called me: ‘Captain, Captain, I think we should change it, move the water inlet pipe to the bottom.’

“I couldn’t immediately process this. How could the water inlet be moved to the bottom? The water would not be able to enter at all. I asked him: ‘Why should we change it like this?’ Who knew he opened his eyes wide, and after a long time, he said: ‘I can’t say why either.’

“Just then, a GAZ-69 drove from afar, straight towards us. I thought, it must be the leader coming. I was really anxious and happy, anxious that the boiler couldn't be lit, what would I show the leader, happy that the superiors are more knowledgeable than us, maybe they could think of a solution. Who knew that the ones who got out of the car were chief mechanical engineer Wang and Soviet expert Panikovski. This really made me happy.

“The expert checked the boiler, and told the translator to tell me: ‘Relocate the water inlet pipe to the lower part of the coil, and he will come to try to fire it himself in the afternoon.’

“This confused me. Isn’t this exactly Yue Wenhan’s idea? I raised my doubts. The expert said: ‘Try it and see, if it doesn’t work, we’ll think of another solution.’

“We started working again.

“In the afternoon, the expert took off his coat and operated it himself. The gas was lit, and after a short while, it burned to three atmospheres. Yue Wenhan touched the pipe, as if he had discovered some miracle, and shouted: ‘It’s hot!’

“People swarmed to the pipeline, and everyone grabbed the pipes. Immediately, a heat flowed through my body. My heart was really comfortable.

“I quickly found the translator and asked him to ask the expert, what is the principle behind this? The expert said: ‘The air blocked it, the water couldn't come down.’

“How simple. I grabbed Yue Wenhan and asked him: ‘Is this what you were thinking too?’

“He smiled and said: ‘I thought about it, but I couldn’t say it.’

“The air flowed, the pipes heated up, and the crude oil thawed.”

Wind, blow if you want to blow, snow, fall if you want to fall, even if the temperature drops further, we are not afraid. Our second batch of boilers has already left the factory again.

Our drilling rigs will never stop, our crude oil will never freeze, and our oil tankers run majestically, one after another.

Karamay, move forward! Severe cold can be overcome.

    严寒是可以战胜的	本报特约记者　刘萧无
    我从乌鲁木齐回来，当天晚上，就听说，有个工人出身的采油队队长试制了一台锅炉。
    十几天前，当我离开克拉玛依的时候，人们还正为这事着急呢！冬天，这儿要冷到零下四十多度。能不能在这儿生活？能不能在这儿进行生产？勇敢的人们，回答只能有一个：要坚持！要和严寒作斗争！
    房子不够，挖地窖。煤炭运不来，打柴禾。没有砖坯、木板，人们动手割芦苇，在钻台四周打围墙。一句话，能够作的都作了。
    只有一件事，最使人着急，锅炉找不着代用品。
    正在钻进的井上，没有锅炉，泥浆要冻。已经出油的井上，没有锅炉，原油要冻。
    这能怨谁呢？要怨，除非是怨克拉玛依发现的太突然，发展得又太快。当初，六十多人，一口井。而今呢？三千多平方公里的土地上，出油的井一座连一座。钻进的井一架又一架。人啊，住在这儿的已经一万多。夏天，热得连气都喘不过来的时候，人们就想到了锅炉的事儿，检查了一下库房，只有十几台，还差得多。
    难道真要叫钻机停转，叫原油冻结，叫一万多颗为祖国建设热情的心被冰雪掩埋住吗？
    在这紧要关头，采油队队长梁达茂自己动手，制造了锅炉，这该是多么激动人心的事，这该是多么值得歌颂的人啊！
    我去访问他。
    个儿不高，也不胖，黄黄的脸，显得比他二十九岁的年龄更苍老，可以想见，生活曾经折磨过他。
    他跟我叙述了制造锅炉的工作过程。
    “9月底的那天，我正在八号井上。这口井呀，谁看见，谁喜欢，原油出的多，不间歇，递减率很小。守着这口宝贝井，谁心里不高兴。可是，那天黄昏时分，风一阵比一阵大，气温降低了。工人们从油罐上下来，顶着风，向我跑来，扯着嗓子喊：
    “‘队长，队长，粘度大了！’
    “我一听，脑子轰的一声，像谁拿大石头砸了一下。赶紧爬上油罐，果然，工人说的一点也不假。
    “要冻！这可怎么办呢？
    “这一夜，我的心纠成一个大疙疸。
    “这一夜，我就没有合上眼，脑子里，七上八下，想了无数条意见，要上级给安锅炉，没锅炉，根本就不用想生产。
    “可是，第二天，一进办公室，还没容我张嘴，工程师任浩就抢先跟我打招呼：
    “‘老梁，你快来，看看这个。’
    “我见桌上放了一张纸，纸上，画了一些螺旋形线条，上头一个方框框，下头……。咱们大老粗，看不出其中的奥妙。
    “任工程师说：你不是要锅炉吗？专家说：‘苏联用过这样的锅炉。’
    “锅炉？咱用过的，见过的，听说过的也不少了，可怎么也和这个图样联系不起来。
    “任工程师指着图上那个方框框说：‘这是水包，’指着那个弹簧说：‘这是盘管。利用井里喷出的瓦斯……’
    “这下，我明白了。
    “谁知任工程师把图往我这边一推，说：‘专家说：这是个意图，是个启发。你参考着这个给咱们设计一个吧。’
    “这回，我可真急了。我说：‘干嘛呀！工程师，跟我开什么玩笑，谁还不知道我，工人出身，文化低……’
    “任工程师一本正经地说：‘你不是烧过锅炉吗？’
    “烧过锅炉也不见得就能设计呀！可是，任工程师说：‘这是处里的意见，搞吧！有什么困难，提出来，上级帮助你。’
    “你不是问我怎么试制锅炉的吗？说实在的，我根本没想到要试制锅炉，要不是上级支持，要不是专家建议，我呀！连想也不敢想。
    “任务嘛，不接受不行，接受了，脑子怎么用也不是地方。”
    他笑了笑，说：“我这个人呀，不钻则已，一钻进去，就出不来了。先是想在盘管头上按个闸门，控制气流，不让管子冻结。后来，又想把盘管加大，先是螺旋式的，后又改成盘肠式的，从一层增加到四层，五层……
    “这时候，别说吃饭了，连孩子的妈跟我说话我都听不见。
    “后来，我就和任工程师一块，拿着画好的图样去见总机械师王湘清，开始，我可怕他了，他问一句，我答一句，一点不敢多说。慢慢地就看出来了，这个人，没架子，踏踏实实的，是个干家，不是专门钻书本子的。他给我指出很多缺点，又帮我想了很多办法，我又把图样改了好几次。最后，他说，行啦！就交到机修厂去作。其实，整个锅炉，除盘管以外，都用的废料，就连盘管也是现成的，作起来挺顺手，不到一个星期就出厂了。
    “调不来吊车，苟耀伯领着十几个工人把锅炉抬上汽车，运到八号井。连夜赶装，该下班的也不走，一直等到装上水，点着了瓦斯，只等放暖气了，谁知盘管里边偏偏不上水。我仔仔细细检查了一遍，没毛病。我坐在那儿，脑子里又前前后后想了一下，还是没毛病。可为什么不上水呢？工人们围着锅炉转，摸摸这儿，碰碰那儿，螺丝不松，也把它拧一拧，管子上有点尘土，也用自己的工作服把它擦一擦。其实，一点用处也没有。
    “忽然，工人岳文汉叫了我一声：‘队长，队长，我看，改一下，把进水管子改到下边来。’
    “我一下转不过这个弯儿来，怎么能把进水口改到下边呢？那水根本就不可能进去，我问他：‘为什么要这样改？’谁知他瞪大了眼睛，好半天，才说：‘我也说不上来为什么。’
    “正在这时，远远地开来一辆嘎斯六十九，一直就往我们这边开。我心想，一定是首长来了。我真是又着急，又高兴，着急的是锅炉烧不成，拿什么给首长看，高兴的是上级比咱学问大，说不定能想出个办法来。谁知从车上下来的正是王总机械师和苏联专家潘尼科夫斯基。这下，可把我给乐坏了。
    “专家把锅炉检查了一遍，叫翻译告我说：‘把进水管改装到盘管下部，等他下午亲自来试烧。’
    “这可把我闹胡涂了，这不正是岳文汉的那主意吗？我提出了我的怀疑。专家说：‘试试看，不行，再想办法。’
    “我们又动起手来。
    “下午，专家把大衣一脱，亲自操作。瓦斯着了，不大一会儿，烧到三个大气压。岳文汉摸了摸管子，像发现了什么奇迹似的，喊了一声：‘热啦！’
    “人唿的一下都跑到管线旁边，都用手握住了管子，马上，一股热流通到我身上。我的心真舒坦极了。
    “我赶紧找着翻译，请他问问专家，这原理到底在哪儿？专家说：‘气顶住了，水下不来。’
    “多简单，我一把抓住岳文汉，问他：‘是不是你也是这样想的？’
    “他笑了笑，说：‘想是想了，就是说不出来。’
    “气流通了，管子热了，原油解冻了。”
    风，要刮你就刮，雪，要下你就下，气温你再降低一些我们也不怕了。我们第二批锅炉已经又出厂了。
    我们的钻机永远也不停，我们的原油永远也不冻，我们的油罐车雄赳赳地一辆跟着一辆跑。
    克拉玛依呀，你前进吧！严寒是可以战胜的。
