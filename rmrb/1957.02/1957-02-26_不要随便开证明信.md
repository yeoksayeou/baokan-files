    Don't Issue Certificates Casually

    Editor:

　　The conscripted soldiers from our unit in 1955 were mostly from Changtu County, Liaoning Province. After these comrades joined the army, they were able to serve with peace of mind and strive for progress. They have made significant progress in their ideological awareness and military skills. However, recently, many comrades have received letters from home saying that their parents or other relatives are seriously ill and hope to return home to visit. Many letters are accompanied by certificates from the local township People's Committee or agricultural cooperative. In order to take care of the comrades' emotions, our unit has approved several comrades to return home to visit. However, similar situations have been increasing, and as of recently, we have received a total of forty-one such letters. After our investigation, some of them are not true. This phenomenon of issuing certificates carelessly has affected the comrades' emotions and brought undue losses to work and study. We suggest that the relevant township People's Committees and agricultural cooperatives in Changtu County should take this work seriously in the future.

    不要随便开证明信
    编辑同志：
　　我部1955年应征入伍的义务兵，绝大部分来自辽宁省昌图县。这些同志入伍以后，都能安心服役，力求上进，在思想觉悟和军事技术上都有显著进步。但是，近来有许多同志接到家中来信，说父母或其他亲人病重，希望回家探望。许多来信中并附有当地乡人民委员会或农业社的证明信件。为了照顾同志们的情绪，我部曾批准过几位同志回家探望。但以后类似情况日益增多，截至最近，我们共计收到这类信件四十一封。经过我们调查，有的并不属实。这种草率开证明信的现象，已经影响了同志们的情绪，给工作和学习带来了不应有的损失。我们建议昌图县各有关乡人民委员会及有关农业社今后应认真对待这项工作。　　　解放军某部政治处
