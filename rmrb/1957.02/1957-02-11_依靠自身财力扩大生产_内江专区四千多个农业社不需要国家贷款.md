Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 10th: Over four thousand agricultural cooperatives in Neijiang Special District, Sichuan, recently announced that they will no longer need national loans this year, as they can solve the capital needed for expanding production this year by relying on the financial resources of their members. The remaining ten thousand-plus agricultural cooperatives in the special district also need significantly less national loan support than in previous years.

Neijiang Special District achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest after realizing basic collectivization last year. The total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations increased by 17% compared to the previous bumper year, and 87% of members increased their income. Moreover, because the cooperatives paid attention to assisting members in developing household sideline occupations and the opening of free markets, ordinary members accumulated more surplus money than in previous years. According to typical surveys in various counties, farmers' cash income this year is about 20% higher than last year, and 50% of members have investment capacity.

Based on this situation, after the final accounts were distributed last year, the agricultural cooperatives in the special district promptly called on their members to improve production with their own financial resources. The vast majority of members responded enthusiastically. In the past month alone, farmers across the district reported investments of more than 6.9 million yuan to their cooperatives, of which more than 2 million yuan has already been paid in cash. In Renshou, Neijiang and other counties, the reported investment amounts broke the original plans several times. The members who invested accounted for more than 60% of the total number of member households. Last year, the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Minjian Township, Neijiang County, increased production by more than 85%. In addition to an average of more than 3,000 jin of grain per member household, they also received 278 yuan in cash. The entire cooperative invested more than 24,000 yuan in two days, and all the funds needed for expanding production this year were resolved.

    依靠自身财力扩大生产
    内江专区四千多个农业社不需要国家贷款
    新华社成都10日电　四川内江专区最近有四千多个农业社宣布今年不再需要国家贷款，它们依靠社员自身的财力就能解决今年扩大生产需用的资金。这个专区的其余的一万多个农业社，需要国家贷款的数量也比往年减少很多。
    内江专区去年实现基本合作化后获得空前丰收，农副业总产值比丰收的前年增产17％，87％的社员增加了收入。而且由于各社注意扶助社员发展家庭副业，以及自由市场的开放，一般社员手中积有比往年更多的余钱。据各县典型调查，今年农民收入的现金比去年多20％左右，50％的社员有投资能力。
    根据这种情况，这个专区各农业社在去年分配决算后，就及时向社员提出用自身财力搞好生产的号召。广大社员热烈响应了。仅最近一个多月内，全区农民向社自报投资金额就达六百九十多万元，其中已缴纳的现金有二百多万元。仁寿、内江等县自报投资金额几次突破了原定计划。投资的社员占总社员户数60％以上。内江县民建乡胜利农业社去年增产85％以上，每户社员平均分到三千多斤粮食外，还分有二百七十八元现金，全社在两天内投资二万四千多元，今年社里扩大生产需用的资金全部解决。
