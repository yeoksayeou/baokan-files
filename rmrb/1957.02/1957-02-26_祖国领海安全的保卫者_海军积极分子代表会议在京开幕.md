    Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy Activist Representatives Conference opened in Beijing today.
    Four hundred and eighty-eight activists and representatives of advanced units who emerged from the task of defending the motherland's territorial waters attended the conference.

Some of them are from naval vessel units, some are from naval aviation and air defense units, and some are from naval ground forces, as well as schools and agencies.
    The opening ceremony was held in the morning. Navy General Xiao Jingguang spoke to the representatives on the issue of the navy's military training and military construction policies. He asked the representatives to promote the spirit of diligent study and hard training, and thrifty military training, based on the characteristics of the navy, and to improve on the existing military technology. He also pointed out that China's coast is not peaceful, and the enemy's harassment activities have not stopped. Our naval forces must be vigilant to protect the security of the motherland's territorial waters and socialist construction.
