    A Worker's Home
    By Our Correspondent Su Lan
    The train passed underground through the "City" of London and arrived in the Stepney district of East London. When I came out of the underground station onto Whitechapel Road, it was five o'clock in the afternoon. The early winter night cast a dark shadow over the sky. Not long ago, I had been here, and the sidewalks were full of stalls—selling bread, potatoes and tomatoes, and also fish and meat. This is a scene rarely seen on the streets of West London. Now, the stalls have all been cleared away, and only the remaining vegetable leaves and scraps of paper are swept up by gusts of cold wind, chasing pedestrians. The streets are cold and deserted, with no dazzling neon lights or ornate shop windows, only some heavy trucks speeding by. Such vehicles are only allowed to pass through West London after midnight.
    After crossing Whitechapel Road, we turned into narrow and dark alleys. Most of the streets in East London are like this: uneven cobblestone roads, with dim streetlights far apart. On both sides of the street are old two-story buildings. Lines of light seeping from the basements were imprinted on the sidewalk. We used these lights to find the home of the baker, Sims.
    We knocked twice on a door. As soon as the door opened a crack, the children's clamor poured out along with the light. The hostess greeted us. She led us into the house, where four children were gathered around eating dinner. One child, taking advantage of his mother's absence, dipped his hand and bread into the milk bowl, spilling it all over himself.
    With the sudden addition of several guests, the room was so crowded that there was hardly any room to move. Mrs. Sims was busy making coffee for us while taking care of the children attentively. She seemed to be a capable housewife.
    I sat on a narrow, long sofa near the door. The room was not heavily furnished, but in this small house, it felt almost filled with various kinds of furniture. Against the west wall was a folding dining table, surrounded by three chairs. A small cabinet leaned against the east wall. With this arrangement, there was no space left in the middle. A small television set was squeezed into the corner of the wall. This was bought using the "installment payment" method. Three shillings were paid every week until it was fully paid. Apart from this, there was a rectangular object covered with old cloth standing in another corner. Later, it was discovered that this was an old sofa, which had to be "on long-term rest" because it could not be accommodated.
    Sims had not returned yet. "The boss is skinning him again," the hostess told us. She meant that her husband was working overtime again. Overtime does not increase wages.
    Sims did not return until six o'clock. When he squeezed his chubby body into the room, we were as crowded as in a train car, and everyone's knees were almost touching.
    The children finished their simple meal. Sims sent the children out. But these little fellows were like loaches, slipping in again through the cracks in the door in a moment. He put the smallest one on my lap.
    How much this couple loves children! The hostess said, "If it didn't cost money to have children, I would be willing to have twenty of them!" Of course, that is not the case. Raising children costs money, and it costs a lot of money. The mother complained to us: Sims's weekly wage is ten pounds. The rent costs one pound and three shillings, and with bread and various expenses, there is not much money left. The hostess said that she had bought a new dress six years ago, and a new pair of shoes two years ago. At this time, we noticed that the pink sweater she was wearing had completely faded.
    Mrs. Sims grabbed the second child and, pointing to the clothes on her, said, "This dress costs more than thirty shillings, these shoes cost more than one pound, and these socks were bought for three shillings." She also told us that Sims often worked shirtless in the summer because this could save some expenses.
    "Now everything is going up in price," Sims spread his hands, making a helpless gesture, and then said humorously, "Even love doesn't cost money, and it doesn't need to be taxed." His words made us laugh.
    Crowded housing and expensive rent are very serious problems in East London. Sims waved his fist and said to us: He applied to the government for housing three years ago. Until now, they have added two more children, and the housing problem has not even received a response. The two older children sleep on the sofa I am sitting on. The smallest one has to sleep in a baby stroller.
    Speaking of this, Mrs. Sims told a very interesting thing:
    "Once, the Minister of Housing and Local Government came to 'inspect' the living conditions in this area. He only circled around our door a few times and was about to leave. I grabbed him and asked him to come into the house and take a look. He did glance at it.
    "I asked, 'How is it?'
    "He said, 'Well! Your house is very clean.'
    "'Clean? Then you move in here and live here!'" She said this, shaking her fist, "That's how I answered him!"
    The children's noises often interrupted our conversation. Sims sent them to a room across the street. That was their bedroom. A bed took up most of the room, and the small space left was occupied by a children's stroller—this was the "bed" for the fourth child. However, Mrs. Sims is pregnant again, and her fifth child will be born this summer. At that time, who will sleep in this little car?
    Our conversation naturally turned to the children again. Their eldest daughter had already entered elementary school. At first, they sent her to a church school, which was much cheaper, but later they transferred the child to another school. Sims said, "Church schools only talk about 'going to heaven after you die' and do not teach children knowledge of life."
    The host's humorous conversation showed a spirit of optimism. He was full of strength and the courage to fight.
    To allow the host to rest, we planned to end this pleasant conversation. But Sims insisted on us visiting his "bathroom." In London, even the most basic houses have bathrooms.
    Through a very narrow kitchen, we groped into a dark small patio. Many washed clothes were hanging down from above, blocking our view. Sims pushed them aside and tapped on the wall with his hand, making a thumping sound. "Look," the bathroom is here."
    Frankly, I didn't see anything at all. It wasn't until I touched it with my hand that I discovered that it was an iron basin hanging on the wall.
    When we said goodbye, the Sims family sent us to the door. The children waved their little hands, saying "goodbye." Sims raised his big fist and gave us a combative salute.

    一个工人之家
    本报记者　苏蓝
    火车从地下穿过了伦敦“城”，就到了东伦敦的史坦伯尼区。当我从地下车站出来，到了怀特恰珀尔路的时候，正是下午五点钟。早临的冬夜，使天空蒙上一层黑幕。不久以前，我曾来过这里，人行道上摆满了货摊——有卖面包的，有卖马铃薯和蕃茄的，也有卖鱼和肉的。这是在西伦敦的街头上很难看到的景色。现在，货摊都已经收光了，只有残留下来的菜叶、纸屑，被阵阵冷风卷起，追逐着行人。街道上冷冷清清，没有耀眼的霓虹灯，也看不到装璜华丽的橱窗，只有一些载重卡车飞驰而过。这种车辆，在西伦敦只有夜半之后才准通行。
    过了怀特恰珀尔路，我们转进了狭窄而阴暗的小巷，东伦敦的街道多半这样：坎坷不平的石子路，相距很远，才有一盏半明不暗的路灯。街道两旁，是古老的两层楼建筑。从地下室里透出来的一线线灯光，印在人行道上。我们就借助这些光亮，寻找着面包工人西姆斯的住宅。
    我们在一扇门上敲了两下，门刚刚打开一条缝，孩子们的吵声就随着灯光一起倾泻出来。迎接我们的是女主人。她把我们引进屋内，在这儿，四个孩子正围在一块吃晚饭。一个孩子乘妈妈不在，把手和面包一齐伸进牛奶碗里，并且撒了一身。
    突然增加了几个客人之后，房间里挤得几乎没有一片回旋的余地。西姆斯太太一面忙着为我们煮咖啡，一面又周到地照顾着孩子。看来她是个能干的家庭主妇。
    我坐在靠门的一张窄而长的沙发上。屋里陈设并不多，但在这间小房子里，却觉得它几乎被各种各样的家具堆满了。靠西边的墙边，是一张可以折叠的饭桌，旁边围着三把椅子。东边墙上靠着一个小柜子。这样一摆，中间已经没有空隙了。一部小电视机，局促地塞在墙脚里。这是用“分期付款”的办法买来的。每星期付三个先令，直到付满为止。除此以外，就是在另一个墙角里竖立着一个用旧布遮盖起来的长方形的东西。后来才发现，这是一张旧沙发，因为无法安置，只好让它“长期休息”了。
    西姆斯还没有回来。“老板又在剥皮了”，女主人对我们说。她的意思是，丈夫又在加班了。加班是不增加工资的。
    直到六点钟，西姆斯才回来。当他把胖胖的身子塞进这间屋子的时候，我们就像挤在火车厢里一样，大家的膝盖几乎都碰在一起了。
    孩子们吃完了他们简单的饭食。西姆斯把孩子打发出去。可是这些小家伙就像泥鳅一样，一会儿又从门缝里溜进来了。他把最小的一个放在我的膝盖上。
    这对夫妇是多么喜爱孩子呵！女主人说：“如果生孩子不花钱，我愿意生他二十个！”事实当然不是这样。养孩子是要花钱的，而且要花不少钱。母亲向我们诉苦：西姆斯每星期的工资是十镑。房租要花去一镑三个先令，再加上面包和各种开支，就剩不下几个钱了。女主人说：她还是六年前买过一件新衣服，两年前才买过一双新鞋子。这时，我们才注意到她身上穿的那件粉红色的毛衣，已经完全褪色了。
    西姆斯太太顺手抓住了第二个孩子，指着她身上的衣服说：“这件衣服要三十多个先令，这双鞋子花了一镑多，这双袜子是三个先令买来的”。她又告诉我们：西姆斯在夏天经常光着背工作，因为这样可以节省一些开支。
    “现在什么东西都涨价”，西姆斯摊开两手，做了个无可奈何的姿势，然后诙谐地说：“就是爱情不花钱，也不用纳税。”他的话，使得我们笑起来了。
    房屋拥挤，房租昂贵，这在东伦敦是个非常严重的问题。西姆斯一面挥着拳头，一面对我们说：三年以前，他就向政府申请房子了。直到现在，他们又添了两个孩子，房子的问题仍旧连个回音也没有。两个大孩子，就睡在我坐的那张沙发上。最小的一个，只好睡在一辆婴儿手推车里。
    谈到这里，西姆斯太太讲了一件很有趣的事情：
    “有一次，政府的住房和地方政府大臣来，‘视察’这个区的居住情况。他只在我们的门外兜了几个圈儿，就要走了。我把他拉住了，请他到屋里来看看。他果然进来瞟了一眼。
    “我问‘怎么样’？
    “他说：‘嗯！你们家里挺干净。’
    “‘干净？那么你搬到这里来住吧！’”她说到这儿，幌了幌拳头，“我就是这样回答他的！”
    孩子们的吵闹，常常打断我们的谈话。西姆斯把他们送到对面一间房子里去。那是他们的卧室。一张床占去了房间的一大半，剩下的一小块地方，放着一辆儿童手推车——这就是第四个孩子的“床铺”。可是，西姆斯太太又怀孕了，今年夏天，她的第五个孩子就要降生了，那时候，这辆小车子让谁来睡呢？
    我们的谈话，很自然地又转到了孩子身上，他们的大女儿，已经进了小学。起初，他们把她送到教会学校里去，这里收费要便宜得多，但是，后来他们还是把孩子转到别的学校读书了。西姆斯说：“教会学校，光讲，‘你死了以后上天堂’，不教给儿童生活的知识。”
    主人诙谐地谈话，显出一种乐观的精神。他混身充满了力量和斗争的勇气。
    为了让主人休息。我们打算结束这场愉快的谈话了。但是西姆斯坚持要我们参观一下他的“洗澡间”，在伦敦，最起码的住宅都是有洗澡间的。
    穿过一间非常狭小的厨房，摸进了一个漆黑的小天井。许多洗过的衣服，从上面吊下来，挡住了我们的视线。西姆斯拨开它们，用手在墙上敲敲，发出了咚咚的声音。“看”，洗澡间就在这儿。”
    坦白地承认，我的确什么东西都没有看见。直到后来用手摸了摸，才发现，那是挂在墙上的一只铁盆。
    当我们告别的时候，西姆斯全家把我们送到门口。孩子们挥着小手，说着“再见”。西姆斯举起了大拳头，对我们作了一个战斗性的敬礼。
