    Bandung Masses Reject American Yellow Culture
    Recently, the Bandung agency of the American MGM film company organized a "film dance" in an attempt to attract attention to American films, but it failed.
    Some student groups in Bandung believe that the "film dance" is a "despicable practice" and a challenge to the morality and culture of the Indonesian people. A delegation from the Indonesian Anti-Obscenity Action Committee, composed of forty-one youth, women, students, veterans, teachers, and other organizations, visited the Bandung Municipal Government to protest against similar measures taken by the United States in Indonesia.

    French People Have a Strong Thirst for Alcohol
    According to figures released by the French High Committee for the Prevention of Alcoholism, the average French person drinks more than 22 liters (about 5 gallons) of pure alcohol per year. More than 7,000 people are poisoned by alcohol each year.
    The committee also said that a Frenchman's alcohol consumption is ten times that of an American or a Swede, five times that of a Briton, and four times that of a Belgian or Swiss. Among France's 42 million residents, there is an average of one hotel for every 86 people.

    国际简讯
    万隆群众拒绝美国黄色文化
    最近美国米高梅影片公司驻万隆代理处组织了一次“电影舞会”，企图招引人们注意美国电影，但是遭到了失败。
    万隆的一些学生团体认为“电影舞会”是一种“卑鄙的做法”，这是对印度尼西亚人民的道德和文化的挑战。由四十一个青年、妇女、学生、退伍军人、教师等组织组成的印度尼西亚反荒淫行动委员会的代表团访问了万隆市政府，对美国在印度尼西亚所采取的类似的措施提出抗议。
    法国人酒瘾大
    据法国防止酒精中毒最高委员会公布的数字说，一个法国人一年的平均喝酒量达到纯酒精二十二公升（约五加仑）以上。一年有七千多人酒精中毒。
    这个委员会还说，一个法国人的喝酒量等于一个美国人或一个瑞典人喝酒量的十倍，等于英国人的五倍，等于比利时或瑞士人的四倍。在法国的四千二百多万居民中，平均每八十六个人就有一个酒店。
    日本的少年罪犯
    东京消息：日本警察厅14日在国家公安委员会会议上提出的“少年犯罪白皮书”说，去年少年（十四岁以上二十岁以下）刑事犯罪案件达九万九千九百八十起，约占包括成年人在内的全部刑事犯罪案件的20％，比前年增加了4.4％。
    不满十四岁的儿童犯罪案件也比前年增加了14.2％，造成了这种少年犯罪的最高纪录，其中主要是抢劫、暴行、色情等案件。
