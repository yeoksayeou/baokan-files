    Visiting Yong'an City
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhou Changzong
    Starting from Nanping, a mountain city in central Fujian, and heading southeast along the green, jagged-reef-filled Sha River, one reaches the edge of the ancient, undeveloped forests of central Fujian. There, we visited a small city more than five hundred years old: Yong’an County.
    This small city is hidden deep in the mountains, seemingly determined not to reveal itself. As you cross layers of mountain ridges and wind along the roads to approach it, you will naturally think of the line "a secluded path leads to a tranquil place." Anyone who has been to Yong'an will feel that the scenery around this small city is simply picturesque. On the way to the county seat, there are the famous Peach Garden Cave and Hundred Zhang Cliff. Right next to Yong'an City's west, there is a winding stream called Yan River, the water flows north, but its shape resembles a swallow spreading its wings southward. Most attractive of all is the undulating mountain range not far southeast of the county seat. There, an ancient forest shields the sky, like an old man of lush and verdant growth. No one knows how many centuries it has lived, nor how many secrets it hides in its bosom. Recently, Yong'an County has become even more beautiful. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, built by the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, snakes around the north of the city like a steel dragon, stretching its head to the southeast. To the north of the county seat, a railway station and warehouses have been built, and tall railway bridges have been erected over the rivers.
    A man who moved to Yong'an from northern Anhui twenty years ago told me that he loves Yong'an more than his hometown. He said: If you live here, you don’t have to worry about any natural disasters. This place is neither drought-prone nor flood-prone. No matter how heavy the rain is, the surrounding mountain forests will naturally absorb and store the rainwater; even if it doesn't rain for several months, water will still gurgle down from the mountains. He said that Yong'an is a treasure land, and the treasures it produces cannot be exhausted or used up.
    What treasures does Yong'an produce? There are timber, bamboo, dried bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, maobian paper, rosin, etc. The director of the County People's Committee Forestry Bureau gave us the following account: Yong'an County has a forest stock volume of ten million cubic meters. If 100,000 cubic meters of timber are transported out each year, it will take one hundred years to transport it all. Moreover, transporting 100,000 cubic meters of timber a year is only a plan after the Yingxia Railway was built; in the past, they wouldn't even dare to think about it. The director of the Forestry Bureau also told us that this calculation is only based on the existing stock volume. If the annual growth is taken into account, even if only 100,000 cubic meters are shipped out each year, Yong'an's forests will still not be completely logged after one hundred years. Since the opening of the Yingxia Railway, the timber here has begun to play a huge role. Provinces such as Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan have sent people to sign contracts to purchase timber.
    The bamboo produced in Yong'an County now not only supplies the above-mentioned provinces but also Hunan Province. Yong'an has more than 200,000 mu of bamboo. Due to the vast mountainous area and sparse population, with a shortage of labor, only 80,000 mu are currently under management. If all of it is managed in the future, the bamboo production here will be very considerable. As for Yong'an's dried bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, and maobian paper, the output is also quite high.
    Although the people of Yong'an County have such abundant treasures in front of them, they have always lived in poverty in the past. Since Yong'an was established as a county in the third year of the Jingtai reign of the Ming Dynasty, it has been like a discarded maiden. In the years of reactionary rule, there was not even a decent road here, let alone a railway. The mountains were high and the roads were far, and the area was isolated from the outside world. No outsiders came here as guests, and it was difficult to transport local products out. Thousand-year-old pines and tall fir trees in the deep mountains have been sleeping soundly; after they ended their lives, they rotted on their own. The lush, bowl-thick bamboo poles could not be put to use, and people only chopped them up for firewood; shiitake mushrooms and dried bamboo shoots, which are considered valuable foods elsewhere, were worthless here. What is even more heartbreaking is that Yong'an has suffered several catastrophes: During the Anti-Japanese War, Japanese planes bombed Yong'an City into rubble, and later people rebuilt it on the ruins; in 1949, when Liu Ruming's army of the Kuomintang fled through here, they looted the people of Yong'an. After liberation, this county seat was revived, but due to transportation and other limitations, development was not very great.
    In 1955, after the Railway Corps came here to build the Yingxia Railway, Yong'an County became vigorous and prosperous. The rumbling sound of the Railway Corps using explosives to open mountains and clear forests awakened the ancient forests that had been sleeping soundly. Whether they are towering trees or seedlings that have just emerged from the soil, they will no longer be buried in the deep mountains for the rest of their lives, but will come out of the mountains and become the building pillars of factories, mines, and schools. Yong'an County also began to put on new clothes at this time. In this year, two hospitals and four vegetable markets were built in the county seat, and six middle and primary schools were newly built and expanded, and a workers' club was built. In 1956, various enterprises in Yong'an County developed, and new forest industrial sub-bureaus, post and telecommunications bureaus, and automobile freight stations were built. Companies and wholesale stations for petroleum, hardware, food, medicine, textiles, and department stores were established.
    The people of Yong'an, who had been guarding treasures and living in poverty for many years, were all overjoyed for the bright future of their hometown. They fully supported the Railway Corps in building the Yingxia Railway. According to comrades from the County People's Committee, from May 1955 to September 1956, Yong'an, a county with only 90,000 people, provided the following materials to support the construction of the Yingxia Railway: 120,000 railway sleepers, 11,800 cubic meters of timber, 10 million jin of firewood, more than 260,000 bamboo poles, 2.4 million jin of charcoal, more than 7 million jin of vegetables, and more than 18 million jin of grain. In addition, they wove more than 60,000 pairs of straw sandals for the troops and civilian workers.
    The newly built Yingxia Railway is "sending charcoal in the snow" and "icing on the cake" for Yong'an. When we visited Yong'an, the Yingtan-Yong'an section of the Yingxia Railway had not yet officially opened to traffic and only handled temporary freight. According to the person in charge of Yong'an Station, since the Yingtan-Yong'an section of the railway began handling freight in November 1956, more than 2,000 tons of materials have been transported from large cities such as Shanghai to Yong'an, including cloth, rubber shoes, socks, cotton, flour, cigarettes, medicines, etc. This is the first batch of gifts from the worker brothers in the big cities to the farmers in the mountains here. During the same period, more than 7,500 tons of materials were also transported from Yong'an to Shanghai, Beijing, Jinan and other places, mainly timber and bamboo, as well as rosin, turpentine, maobian paper and dried bamboo shoots. This is the first gift from the farmers here to the urban people by train!

    访永安城
    新华社记者　周长宗
    从闽中的山城——南平出发，沿着绿色的、满布着嶙峋岩礁的沙溪向东南走，就到了福建中部的从未开发过的古老森林的边沿。在那里，我们访问了一座年龄已经超过五百岁的小城市——永安县城。
    这座小城市躲藏在深山当中，似乎决心不让自己抛头露面。当你越过层层的山岭，穿过蜿蜒的道路而走近它的时候，你会很自然地联想到“曲径通幽处”这一诗句。凡是到过永安的人，都会觉得这座小城市周围，简直风景如画。在到县城来的路上，有著名的桃园洞和百丈岩。在紧靠永安城西，有一条弯曲的溪流，名叫燕江，水是向北流的，但它的形状却像一只向南展翅飞翔的燕子。最吸引人的是，从县城向东南出去不远，就是起伏的群峰，那边有遮天蔽日的古老的森林，像一个苍郁的老人，没有人知道它活了多少个世纪，也没有人知道它胸怀中隐藏着多少秘密。近来，永安县城显得更加美丽了。中国人民解放军铁道兵修建的鹰潭到厦门的铁路，像一条钢铁之龙，从城北绕过，把头伸向东南。县城北边，修起了火车站和仓房，河流上面，也架起了高高的铁路大桥。
    一个二十年前从安徽北部迁居到永安来的人告诉我，他爱永安，胜过爱他的故乡。他说：你要在这里过日子，用不着担心发生什么天灾。这个地方既不会旱，也不会涝。天下多么大的雨，自有周围山上的森林把雨水吸收和储藏起来；一连几个月不下雨，山上也仍然会淙淙地流下水来。他说，永安是块宝地，它出的财宝采不完、也用不完。
    永安出些什么财宝呢？有木材、竹子、笋干、香菇、毛边纸、松香，等等。县人民委员会林业局局长给我们算了这样一笔账：永安县的森林积材量有一千万立方公尺，如果每年往外运十万立方公尺木材，那就要有一百年才能运完。而且，一年往外运十万立方公尺木材，还是鹰厦铁路修通以后的打算，过去他们连这样想都不敢。林业局局长还对我们说，这笔账只是按现有的积材量计算的，如果把每年的增长量计算进去，在每年只运出十万立方公尺的情况下，一百年以后，永安的森林也还采伐不完。自从鹰厦铁路修通以后，这里的木材正在开始发挥巨大的作用。江苏、山东、安徽、河南等省，都已经派人来订立了购买木材的合同。
    永安县出产的竹子，现在不但供应上述几个省，还要供给湖南省。永安有二十多万亩竹子，由于山区地广人稀，劳动力少，现在只经营了八万亩。如果将来全部经营起来，这里的产竹量将是十分可观的。至于永安的笋干、香菇和毛边纸，产量也相当高。
    永安县人民面前虽然摆着这样丰富的财宝，但是过去他们却一直过着贫穷的日子。永安自从明朝景泰三年开县以来，一直像一个被人摈弃了的少女。在反动政权统治的年代，这里不要说是铁路，甚至连一条像样的公路也没有。山高路远，内外隔绝，没有外人到这里来作客，这里的物产也难得运出去。深山中的千年老松和高大的杉树一直在酣睡着；当它们结束了自己的生命之后，便自行腐烂。翠绿的、碗口粗的大竹竿，排不出用场，人们只把它劈碎了当柴烧；在外地说来是名贵食品的香菇和笋干，在这里却不值钱。更令人痛心的是，永安曾经遭受过数次浩劫：在抗日战争期间，日寇的飞机曾经把永安城轰炸成一片瓦砾，后来人们在废墟上把它重建起来；1949年，国民党刘汝明带领的军队逃窜时经过这里，又把永安人民抢劫一空。解放以后，这个县城复活了，但是由于交通等方面的限制，发展不是很大。
    1955年，铁道兵开到这里来修建鹰厦铁路以后，永安县城变得生气蓬勃了。铁道兵用炸药开山辟林的隆隆声，惊醒了酣睡着的古老的森林。无论是高耸云天的大树或者是刚刚从泥土里钻出来的树苗，今后都再也不会在深山中埋没一生，而是要走出丛山，成为工厂、矿山、学校的建筑栋梁了。永安县城在这时候也开始换上新装，在这一年当中，县城里修建了两所医院，四个菜市场，新建和扩建了六所中学和小学，修建了一所工人俱乐部。1956年，永安县的各种企业都有发展，新建了森林工业支局、邮电局和汽车货运站，设立了石油、五金、食品、医药等公司和纺织、百货等批发站。
    多少年来守着财宝而过着贫穷日子的永安人民，都为自己家乡的美好将来而欢欣鼓舞。他们全力支援铁道兵来修建鹰厦铁路。据县人民委员会的同志告诉我们，永安这个仅有九万人口的县份，从1955年
  5月到1956年9月，支援修建鹰厦铁路的物资计有：十二万根枕木，一万一千八百立方木材，一千万斤烧柴，二十六万多根竹竿，二百四十万斤木炭，七百多万斤菜蔬，一千八百多万斤粮食。另外，他们为部队和民工编的草鞋就有六万多双。
    新建的鹰厦铁路，对于永安说来，是“雪里送炭”，也是“锦上添花”。当我们到永安访问的时候，鹰厦铁路鹰潭到永安段还没有正式通车，只办理临时货运。据永安车站的负责人说，鹰潭到永安一段铁路从1956年11月份办理货运以来，由上海等大城市运到永安来的物资有两千多吨，其中有布、胶鞋、袜子、棉花、面粉、香烟、药品，等等。这是大城市的工人弟兄们用火车给这里山区农民送来的第一批礼物。在同一时间内，也由永安运往上海、北京、济南等地七千五百多吨物资，其中主要是木材、竹子，还有松香、松节油、毛边纸和笋干。这是这里的农民第一次经过火车给城市人民的赠礼！
