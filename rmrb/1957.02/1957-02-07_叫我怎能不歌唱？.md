　　　　Drum Singer

　　On the night of January 14, snowflakes were flying and the north wind was roaring in the Dabie Mountains. In the office of the Red Star First Agricultural Cooperative of Lisheng Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, a red fire was lit, and people gathered around the fire to discuss the work of the cooperative. After the meeting, someone suggested asking He Zhongyi to perform a piece of "Hubei Drum" to add to the atmosphere of the snowy night. He Zhongyi cleared his throat and began to sing:

　　Zhongyi was truly pitiful in the past,
　　Suffering year after year,
　　Having no clothes in the dead of winter,
　　Buying a bucket of bean dregs to get through the year.
　　Individual farming brings great difficulties,
　　The benefits of the advanced cooperative are endless,
　　This year's production increased by over a hundred yuan,
　　The whole family rejoices with joy. …

　　As the sound fell, everyone applauded. He Zhongyi is a well-known active figure in the entire cooperative. He is indispensable for singing a segment during festivals and gatherings.

　　The next day, we braved the snow to visit his home. He Zhongyi was grinding rice in the house, with his old grandmother, wife, and daughter sitting beside him. They were chatting and laughing, spinning thread, and sewing soles.

　　Our conversation started with singing drum songs. He Zhongyi stopped the rice mill and sighed, "More than twenty years ago—when I was thirteen years old, my parents passed away, and I was left with no one to rely on. I couldn't lift heavy things, and I couldn't carry burdens. To make a living, I apprenticed to learn to sing drum songs, wandering around; but at that time, even if I sang until my throat was hoarse, it was difficult to get a full meal. The two mu of land and a little furniture left by my parents were sold out, and I couldn't wear cotton clothes in the dead of winter." Talking about the time after liberation, He Zhongyi was very excited, and his voice also rose. He said that after liberation, land was distributed, but at that time, individual farming lacked cattle and fertilizer, and life was still not very good. He joined the advanced cooperative last year, and life has completely changed. He said, "At the end of the year, 98% of the members of our cooperative increased their income, and my family received more than 400 yuan, an increase of more than 120 yuan compared to last year." He pointed to the many things on the table, "Look, my family has prepared all the New Year's goods, but in previous years, these things were still not settled by the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month!"

　　He Zhongyi became more and more happy, turned to his daughter and said, "Bring out our family's production plan for this year, and ask the comrades for advice." The daughter took a piece of red paper from the box and handed it to him. He took it and read, "In 1957, the whole family will do 5,000 work points, raise one pig and one cow each, feed twenty chickens,... the total income will be 1,002 yuan. After deducting food, clothing, pocket money, children's schooling, and production investment, the net surplus will be 623 yuan. Buy 100 yuan of public bonds, and open a savings account at the bank." He couldn't help but smile as he read, and everyone laughed along with him.

　　Finally, he said meaningfully: "My past and present are just as the saying goes: 'heaven' and 'earth'—two worlds. Although I no longer rely on singing drum songs to make a living, I feel itchy in my throat when I think of these happy things. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, how can I not sing?"

　　　　A Girl from Another Township Comes to the Door

　　In September of last year, after the harvest of the Red Star Cooperative, member Cheng Jinbao was sent to the Daye mine to repair the railway. One day, Jinbao's maternal grandmother brought a young and beautiful strange girl to his home. Jinbao's parents were at a loss. The grandmother said calmly: "This is the eldest girl from the Zhou family in our township—Yanmei." Afterwards, when she saw that Yanmei was not in front of her, the grandmother whispered to her daughter and son-in-law: "The Zhou family girl has taken a liking to your Jinbao and has come to propose marriage!"

　　Speaking of Jinbao's marriage, it evoked a sad story for Jinbao's parents: Before liberation, when Jinbao was young, he had been engaged to a girl from a middle peasant Zhou family in another township. But after the engagement, Jinbao's family became poorer and poorer. Later, when Jinbao grew up and proposed to marry, the Zhou family disliked his family for having little land and a dilapidated house, and broke off the engagement. Since then, year after year,... Jinbao was almost thirty years old, and no one had proposed marriage to him again. …

　　The winter before last, his family joined the advanced cooperative. Jinbao was young and strong, worked actively, and was ideologically advanced, and life became stronger day by day, and he quickly became famous. This news reached the ears of Zhou Yanmei of the Jinxing Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Baizhai Township. With the introduction of Jinbao's maternal grandmother, Yanmei decided to talk to Jinbao in person. Unfortunately, Jinbao was out, so she stayed at Cheng's house, waiting for him. A month later, Jinbao returned home from his work on the railway. As soon as the children in the neighborhood saw him, they shouted, "Congratulations, congratulations, Jinbao's good luck has come!" He stepped into the house, and his parents told him the whole story in private, and he was even more surprised and happy. After the two simple young peasants got to know each other, they got married soon because they were in tune with each other.

　　After marriage, their lives were very sweet. A few days ago, when the cooperative summarized the superiority of the advanced cooperative, Jinbao stood up in public and said proudly: "I am a living example. In the past, individual farming was difficult, and I was engaged but the engagement was broken off; joining the advanced cooperative eradicated poverty, and a girl from another township came to my door."

　　　　"Broken Mirror Rejoined"

　　Wu Suzhen was a strong and competitive girl. In 1953, she married Cheng Shuangwang, a demobilized soldier. Shuangwang was young and ignorant, not good at production, and somewhat lazy. For several years after the marriage, he could not manage to have enough food and clothing. Suzhen had repeatedly advised him, but he did not change. Suzhen proposed to divorce him in a fit of anger. At that time, the township cadres advised Suzhen to think it over and slowly help Shuangwang, so she did not insist on the divorce. But she was still angry, so she took all the dowry back to her parents' home and stayed there for more than a year.

　　The winter before last, Shuangwang joined the advanced cooperative. With the help of the members, he changed his lazy habits and learned how to produce. The cooperative also helped Shuangwang renovate his dilapidated house that had been in disrepair for many years.

　　Shuangwang's transformation touched Wu Suzhen. Before Shuangwang could plead or say anything good, she automatically carried her dowry back. When the reporter visited Shuangwang's home, the director of the cooperative, old man Cheng Yanshan, happened to be there too. Suzhen was teasing a chubby baby. Old man Yanshan joked, "Suzhen, if it weren't for cooperativization that 'transformed' you back, where could we find such a little treasure!"

　　　　Two "Boundary Stones" Were Dug Up Together

　　In the winter sowing season of 1954, Cheng Damao, an old upper-middle peasant in Lisheng Township, had sores on his hands, and his wife was in "confinement," so he was worried that he could not take care of the production at home. Just then, the first elementary cooperative was established in the township, and he joined it. At that time, members automatically removed some useless field ridges for the convenience of cultivation. During spring plowing, member Cheng Yanzhi was plowing the land, and was driving the ox forward when he suddenly heard a "crack" and the plowshare was broken. Digging it up, it turned out to be a secretly buried land boundary stone. He was furious. Seeing that this field belonged to Cheng Damao, he rushed to Cheng Damao to demand compensation for the plowshare and to dig up the boundary stone. Cheng Damao knew that he was wrong, but he refused to admit it. He thought: My land is good, and my farming tools are complete. Who knows if the cooperative will be better than my individual farming? So, he insisted on not digging up this boundary stone, saying that he would wait until the grain was distributed before digging it up.

　　During the autumn harvest distribution the following year, he increased his income by 18 yuan compared to individual farming. He wanted to dig up the boundary stone, but at this time, the great storm of cooperativization came again, and the members of this elementary cooperative demanded to move forward and discussed turning to an advanced cooperative. Cheng Damao thought: In the elementary cooperative, there is still a share of land compensation, and I have not suffered a loss; but the advanced cooperative will completely abolish land compensation. Who knows if I can maintain the increase in production in the future? Let's wait and see for another year.

　　Cheng Damao was an honest farmer. Although he joined the advanced cooperative, he had a "disease" in his heart. However, he still worked very actively in the cooperative for a year. As a result, at the end of the year, he earned more than 80 yuan more than in the elementary cooperative; and he himself was rated as an excellent member, truly "both prosperous." After he dug up the "boundary stone" buried in his heart, he immediately walked to his original field and swung his hoe to dig up the boundary stone buried in the ground.

    叫我怎能不歌唱？
      新华社记者　蔚生　国翰
          鼓书艺人
    1月14日夜晚，大别山区雪花飞扬，北风怒吼。湖北省麻城县李胜乡红星第一农业社办公室里，烧起红红的柴火，人们围火讨论社里的工作。散会后，有人提议叫何中义来段“湖北大鼓”，为雪夜助兴。何中义润一润喉咙，接口唱了起来：
    中义从前真可怜，
    年复一年受熬煎，
    十冬腊月无衣服，
    买桶豆渣过了年。
    单干生活困难大，
    高级社好处说不完，
    今年增产百多元，
    全家欢乐喜连天。……
    音声一落，大家拍手叫好。何中义是全社有名的活跃人物。逢年过节搞联欢，都少不了他唱一段。
    第二天，我们冒雪到他家访问。何中义正在屋里碾米，旁边坐着老祖母和他的妻子、女儿。她们有说有笑，一边纺线，一边纳鞋底。
    我们的话从唱鼓书谈起。何中义把碾杠一停，叹口气说：“二十多年以前——我十三岁那年，父母双亡，无依无靠的我，手不能提，肩不能挑，为了生活，就拜师学唱鼓书，四处流浪；可是那时候，唱破了嗓子，也难混一顿饱饭，父母留下的两亩地和一点家具也卖了个精光，十冬腊月穿不上棉衣。”谈到解放以后，何中义很兴奋，嗓门也提高了。他说，解放后分了田，可是那时单干没牛缺肥，日子还是不大好过。去年参加了高级社，生活才彻底变过来。他说：“年终决算，我们全社98％的社员都增加了收入，我家分了四百多元钱，比去年增加一百二十多元。”他指着桌上的许多东西，“你看，我家年货都办了，往年到腊月二十八，这些东西还没着落哩！”
    何中义越说越高兴，回头对女儿说：“把咱们全家今年的增产规划拿出来，向同志们请教请教。”女儿从箱子里拿出一张红纸递给他，他接过念起来：“1957年全家做五千个工分，养猪、牛各一头，喂鸡二十只，……共收入一千零二元，除去吃、穿、零花，孩子上学和生产投资，净余六百二十三元，买上一百元的公债，银行里立一本存折。”他念着念着忍不住笑了，大家也跟着笑了。
    最后，他意味深长地说：“我的过去和现在，正如俗话所说的：‘天上’，‘地下’——两个世界。虽然我不再靠唱鼓书维生，可是想起这些高兴事，嗓子老发痒，想想过去，看看现在，叫我怎能不歌唱？”
      外乡的姑娘找上门
    去年9月间，红星社丰收后，社员程金保被派往大冶矿山修铁路去了。一天，金保的外婆带着一个又年轻，又漂亮的陌生姑娘，来到他的家里。金保的父母当时弄得莫名其妙，外婆不慌不忙说：“这个是我们乡里周家的大姑娘——燕梅。”随后，瞅燕梅不在眼前，外婆小声对女儿和女婿说：“周家姑娘看中了你家金保，登门相亲来啦！”
    提起金保的婚事，勾引起金保父母一段伤心事：那是解放以前，金保小的时候，曾和外乡一个周姓中农家的姑娘订了亲。可是订亲后，金保家越过越穷。后来金保长大了，提出迎亲的话，谁知周家嫌他家田少屋破，赖了婚。从此，一年、两年，……金保快三十岁了，再也没人给他提过亲。……
    前年冬天，他家参加了高级社。金保年轻力壮，劳动积极，思想进步，日子一天比一天过得强，很快出了名声。这消息传到了拜郊乡金星第四农业社周燕梅的耳朵里。经金保的外婆一介绍，燕梅决定亲自找金保谈谈。不巧，金保出门了，她就留在程家，等待着他。一个月后，金保从铁路上散工回到家里，四邻家的孩子们一见他就嚷嚷着喊：“恭喜，恭喜，金宝哥的红运来啦！”他踏进家门，父母把原委悄悄告诉他，他更是又惊又喜。这对朴实的青年农民认识以后，由于情投意合，不久就结婚了。
    婚后，他们的日子过得很甜蜜。前几天，社里总结高级社优越性的时候，金保当众一站，得意地说：“我就是个活典型，往年单干难上难，订了亲又给赖了亲；加入高级社挖了穷根，外乡的姑娘找上了门。”
    “破镜重圆”
    吴素珍是个刚强好胜的姑娘，1953年和复员军人程双旺结了婚。双旺年轻不懂事，生产不在行，人又有些懒散，结婚后几年总混不住吃穿。素珍曾三番五次规劝他，他不改。素珍一气就提出和他离婚。当时乡里干部劝素珍，叫她想开些，慢慢帮助双旺，她才没坚持离婚。可是她还是气不过，就把配嫁的东西全都挑回娘家，一住就是一年多。
    前年冬天双旺参加了高级社，在社员们的帮助下，改变了懒散作风，又学会了生产，社里并帮助双旺把年久失修的破房子修整一新。
    双旺的转变感动了吴素珍，不等双旺求情说好，她就自动挑着嫁奁回来了。当记者到双旺家访问，正赶上社主任程燕山老汉也在场，素珍正逗着胖娃娃玩哩。燕山老汉开玩笑说：“素珍，要不是合作化把你给“化”回来，到哪里寻个小宝贝儿哩！”
    两块“界石”齐挖掉
    1954年冬播时节，李胜乡老上中农程大毛手上长疮，老婆又在“坐月子”，正愁屋里的生产顾不过来。恰好，乡里办起第一个初级社，他就参加了。当时社员们为了耕作方便，自动扒去了一些无用的田埂。春耕的时候，社员程燕志犁地，正驱牛前进中，忽听“喀嚓”一声犁铧被打断了。刨开看，原来是一块暗埋的地界石。他可火了，一看这块田是程大毛的，就急呼呼地找程大毛赔犁铧，刨界石。程大毛自知理屈，却不肯认账。他想：我的田地好，农具全，谁晓得合作社会不会比我单干强？于是，他坚持不让刨这块地界石，说是非等粮食分到手再刨。
    第二年秋收分配，他比单干时增加收入十八元。本想就去刨掉界石，可是这时候，合作化的大风暴又来了，这个初级社的社员们要求前进一步，商量着转高级社。程大毛转念一想：在初级社里，还有土地的一份报酬，我没吃亏；可是高级社要完全取消土地报酬，谁知道今后是不是能保住增产？还是看一年再说吧。
    程大毛是个老实农民，虽然加入高级社心里却有块“病”。但是，一年来他在社里劳动还是挺积极的。结果，去年年终决算，又比初级社多收入八十多元；并且他本人又被评为优秀社员，真是“人财两旺”。当他把埋在心里的“界石”挖去以后，马上走到原先自己的田里，抡起镢头把埋在地下的界石也刨掉了。
