Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: Xinhua News Agency reporter An Zhonghuang reports: More than thirty well-known medical experts in Beijing discussed late marriage and contraception issues on the 20th. Shao Lizi, a representative of the National People's Congress, was also invited to participate in the symposium.

The symposium began with the question of greatest concern to unmarried men and women: "What are the physiological effects of late marriage from all perspectives?" Experts believe that from a physiological point of view, it is not considered late marriage for women to marry between the ages of twenty and twenty-five, and for men to marry between the ages of thirty and thirty-five, so there is no physiological impact. Physiological expert Zhang Xijun cited materials from the United States and Germany: According to a survey of 1,183 American women, their average age of marriage was 24 and a half years old; Germany also had regulations that the marriage age was 29 for men and 25 for women. He said: Although women's sexual organs mature at the age of eighteen, their entire body is not in the most mature period of growth. At the same time, the kidneys and pituitary gland have a close relationship. Early marriage is not only harmful to the kidneys, but also affects the cerebral cortex, causing neurasthenia and other symptoms. This not only impairs one's own health, but also affects the physique of the next generation.

Obstetrics and gynecology expert Lin Qiaozhi and neuropsychiatric expert Xu Yingkui believe that the marriage age stipulated in our country is the minimum marriage age, not the best marriage age. Lin Qiaozhi said that so far, she has not found any basis in obstetrics and gynecology to say that women who marry around the age of twenty-five are less likely to become pregnant or have difficult labor after pregnancy. She said that a woman who married eight years ago and is now thirty-six years old gave birth to her first child smoothly a few days ago.

According to medical record statistics, the age of mothers with difficult labor is fifteen to twenty-two years old, and less often, twenty-two to twenty-nine years old. From an obstetrical and gynecological point of view, the best time for a woman to marry is at the age of twenty-five. Internal medicine expert Zhang Xiaoqian said that some people think that it is late marriage for women to marry at the age of twenty-five, and that the pelvis will harden when women marry at the age of twenty-five, making future childbirth difficult, which is completely unfounded. She said that her eldest daughter married very late, and her first child was at the age of thirty-three, and she did not have a difficult labor.

Shao Lizi said at the symposium that his mother married at the age of twenty-nine, gave birth to her first child at the age of thirty, and gave birth to her second child at the age of thirty-two, and there was no difficulty in childbirth. Therefore, the idea that women have difficulty in childbearing after the age of twenty-five should be broken.

Li Zongen, an internal medicine expert and president of Peking Union Medical College, and Yan Renying, an obstetrics and gynecology expert, believe that it is not appropriate for college students to marry while studying. From the perspective of national and personal interests, college students should be advised not to marry early.

Do vasectomy or tubal ligation have any impact on the body? Experts expressed their opinions on this issue of greatest concern to many married men and women.

Urology expert Wu Jieping said that vasectomy is a simple and easy method of sterilization for men. This surgery is painless, does not hinder normal physiology, and does not affect sexual life after the surgery. Urology expert Wang Ligeng said that vasectomy surgery for men is simple and can be performed in the outpatient clinic. Skilled doctors can complete it in about ten minutes. He said that people who have undergone this surgery by him are in good physical and mental condition.

Endocrinology expert Chi Zhisheng believes that the increase or decrease in libido after vasectomy in men is related to the mental state of the person and has nothing to do with the surgery.

Internal medicine expert Zhang Xiaoqian and surgical expert Zeng Xianjiu also emphasized that vasectomy should be greatly promoted in terms of contraception.

Obstetrics and gynecology expert Song Hongzhao said that the changes in the bodies of some women after tubal ligation are not caused by the surgery itself, but by poor surgical techniques. Some women experience natural imbalances in various bodily functions as they age after tubal ligation. However, they mistakenly believe that the changes in their bodies are the result of tubal ligation.

Which contraceptive method is the most effective? What are the advantages and disadvantages of induced abortion? Obstetrics and gynecology expert Song Hongzhao discussed this issue. He believes that the currently promoted contraceptive methods, such as using contraceptive devices, medicines, and calculating the safe period, are all effective; but he believes that this is a complex issue related to technical conditions, economy, and the level of health knowledge of the general public. The most effective method for a few people may not be suitable for promotion among the general public. Therefore, social factors must be considered when promoting contraceptive methods, and there should be differences between cities and villages. Even in cities, one should not only focus on the effect. He said that existing methods such as using cervical caps, condoms, and contraceptive creams are all good, but people are unwilling to use them or cannot persist, because they are not used to it or are afraid of trouble. If these two ideas cannot be overcome, no matter how good the method is, it will not achieve good results. Song Hongzhao said that induced abortion has certain risks. There are two types of induced abortion: one is to operate and scrape the uterus, and the other is to induce labor; relatively speaking, surgery is safer, but both have shortcomings. There are many possibilities for menstrual disorders and decreased libido after induced abortion. He believes that the main method of contraception is contraception, and induced abortion cannot solve the problem of having many children. After induced abortion, there is still the possibility of pregnancy, and the second induced abortion is even more dangerous. Song Hongzhao believes that induced abortion is only suitable for patients with severe medical conditions who are pregnant.

This symposium was convened by the All-China Medical Association. Experts in obstetrics and gynecology, endocrinology, urology, biochemistry, neurology, physiology, internal medicine, surgery, and traditional Chinese medicine participated in the symposium. Fu Lianzhang, president of the All-China Medical Association, said at the end of the symposium: The medical experts' speeches put forward many useful suggestions. He said: Marrying at a reasonable marriage age (around twenty-five for women and around thirty for men), and having planned childbirth, is beneficial to the country's socialist construction and to individuals in establishing happy families, and should be vigorously publicized and promoted. Relevant parties should vigorously publicize the positive significance of contraception. Fu Lianzhang also pointed out in his speech that restrictions on vasectomy and tubal ligation should be appropriately relaxed in the future. Abortion is harmful to the body and should be vigorously publicized and explained, but it should also be carried out when necessary. He also hopes that medical experts will continue to research and find the best and most effective contraceptive methods.

### 首都医学界座谈晚婚和避孕问题

    对国家、个人、家庭来说，是早婚好还是晚婚好？实行避孕用甚么方法最科学有效？
    首都医学界座谈晚婚和避孕问题
    据新华社21日讯　新华社记者安仲皇报道：北京三十多位著名医学家20日座谈了晚婚和避孕问题。全国人民代表大会代表邵力子也应邀参加了座谈会。
    座谈是从广大未婚男女最关心的“晚婚从各方面观察在生理上有什么影响”这个问题开始的。专家们认为，从生理上讲，女性在二十岁到二十五岁、男性在三十岁到三十五岁结婚并不算晚婚，因此，谈不上对人的生理有什么影响。生理专家张锡钧引证美国和德国的材料：根据对一千一百八十三个美国的妇女的调查，她们结婚的年龄平均是二十四岁半；德国也曾有过结婚年龄男性是二十九岁、女性是二十五岁的规定。他说：女性在十八岁时，性的器官虽然发育成熟了，但整个身体还不是生长最成熟的时期，同时肾脏和大脑垂体有密切关系，早婚不但对肾脏有害，同时也会影响大脑皮质，造成神经衰弱等症。这样，不但有损本人的健康，也影响下一代的体质。
    妇产科专家林巧稚、神经精神专家许英魁认为：我国规定的结婚年龄乃是最低限度的结婚年龄，而不是最好的结婚年龄。林巧稚说，到现在为止，在我们妇产科还找不出任何根据说二十五岁左右结婚的女子不易怀孕或怀孕后难产。她说，有一位在八年前结婚现已三十六岁的妇女，在前几天顺利地生了第一胎。
    根据病历统计，产妇难产的年龄，是十五至二十二岁，较少的，是二十二至二十九岁。从妇产学上看，女子二十五岁结婚是最好的时期。内科专家张孝骞说，有些人认为女子二十五岁结婚是晚婚，说女子到二十五岁时结婚骨盆要硬化，以后生产困难，这是毫无根据的。她说，他的大女儿结婚很迟，头胎是三十三岁，并没难产。
    邵力子在座谈会上说，他的母亲二十九岁结婚，三十岁生第一胎，三十二岁生第二胎，生产并没有什么困难，因此女性二十五岁以后生育困难的说法应打破。
    内科专家、中国协和医学院院长李宗恩，妇产科专家严仁英认为大学生在就学时结婚是不适宜的，从国家和个人利益来看，应劝大学生不要早婚。
    结扎输精管或结扎输卵管对身体有无影响？专家们就这个许多已婚男女最关心的问题发表了意见。
    泌尿科专家吴阶平说，男性结扎输精管是简而易行的绝育方法。这种手术没有痛苦，对正常生理没有障碍，手术后对性的生活没有影响。泌尿科专家王历畊说，男性结扎输精管手术简便，在门诊时就可以作，熟练的大夫只要十分钟左右就可作完。他说，经他作过这种手术的人身体和精神都很好。
    内分泌专家池芝盛认为，男性结扎输精管后，性欲的增减同人的精神作用有关，同手术没有关系。
    内科专家张孝骞、外科专家曾宪九也强调在节育方面应大大提倡男性结扎输精管。
    妇产科专家宋鸿钊说，某些妇女结扎输卵管后身体的变化，不是由于手术本身引起的，而是由于手术技术不好引起的。有些妇女结扎输卵管后，因年龄增长而发生身体各种功能的自然失调。但是她们却错误地认为身体的变化是结扎输卵管的结果。
    哪一种避孕方法最有效？人工流产的利弊是什么？妇产科专家宋鸿钊谈了这个问题。他认为目前推行的用避孕器械、药品以及计算安全期等避孕方法都有效果；但他认为，这是和技术条件、经济以及广大人民的卫生知识水平等有关的一个复杂问题。少数人行之最有效的方法，不一定适于在广大群众中推广。因此，在推广避孕方法时要考虑到社会方面的因素，城市和乡村应有所不同，即使在城市也不能单从效果着眼。他说，现有的方法如用子宫帽、阴茎套、避孕药膏等都是很好的，但人们不愿使用或不能坚持，其原因是不习惯，或是怕麻烦。假如这两种思想不能克服，再好的方法也不会得到好的效果。宋鸿钊说，人工流产有一定的危险性。人工流产有两种：一种是动手术刮子宫，一种是打胎；两种比较起来，手术较安全，但都有缺点。人工流产后发生月经失调，性欲减退的可能性很多。他认为节育的主要方法是避孕，人工流产不能解决子女多的问题。人工流产后，还有怀孕的可能，第二次人工流产，危险性更大。宋鸿钊认为人工流产只有对某一种病情严重而又怀孕的病人比较适宜。
    这个座谈会是由中华医学会总会召开的。参加座谈的有妇产、内分泌、泌尿、生化、神经、生理、内、外科及中医等各方面的专家。中华医学会总会会长傅连暲在座谈会结束时说：医学专家的发言提出了许多有益的意见。他说：在合理的结婚年龄结婚（女性二十五岁左右，男性三十岁左右），以及有计划地生育，对国家的社会主义建设以及个人建立幸福家庭都有好处，应大力宣传和提倡。有关方面应大力宣传节育的积极意义。傅连暲在发言中并指出，今后应当适当放宽对结扎输精管、输卵管的限制。流产对身体有害，应大力宣传解释，但在必要时，也应该予以进行。他还希望医学专家们继续研究，找出最好、最有效的避孕方法。
