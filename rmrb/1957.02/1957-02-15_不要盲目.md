　　Don't Be Blind
　　Judging from the materials we have received, there are quite a few agricultural cooperatives like the Hualing Agricultural Cooperative that have done a very perfunctory job in preparing for spring plowing, or have not even started. Some cooperatives’ spring plowing activities appear to be in full swing on the surface; however, a thorough inspection will reveal many problems.
　　These cooperatives have failed to do a good job in preparing for spring plowing for various specific reasons. From an ideological point of view, some are overly optimistic and content with their existing achievements; others are mired in pessimism and have lost confidence in moving forward. Examining the specific work, the reasons are even more complex and diverse. Leaders must go deep into the masses and deep into reality, and have a clear understanding of the specific work situation and the ideological situation of the masses in their localities. The most harmful thing is blindness—whether it is blind pessimism or blind optimism. A careful and meticulous inspection like that of the "Five Greats" Agricultural Cooperative can reveal many new problems. Discovering problems is the first step in solving them.

    不要盲目
    从我们收到的一些材料看，像花岭农业社这样备耕工作做得很潦草、甚至没有动手的农业社还不少。有些社的备耕活动，从表面看也还轰轰烈烈；可是，深入检查一下，就会发现很多问题。
    这些社的备耕工作没做好，各有各的具体原因。从思想上来检查，有的是因为过于乐观，满足于已有的成绩；有的是因为陷于悲观的泥沼，丧失了前进的信心。从具体工作来检查，原因就更复杂多样了。领导者必须深入群众、深入实际，对当地的具体工作情况和群众思想情况了若指掌。最有害的是盲目——不管是盲目悲观还是盲目乐观。像“五大”农业社那样认真细致地检查，就能发现许多新问题。发现问题，正是解决问题的第一步。
