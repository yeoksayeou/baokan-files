　　The fishhooks of Lin Nanxing & Co. in Xiamen enjoy a high reputation among fishermen in the coastal areas of Fujian and Southeast Asia. Fishermen say, "If a fish just passes by a Lin Nanxing hook in the sea, it will be caught."

　　Lin Gongjiao, the owner of Lin Nanxing & Co., came from a poor family in his childhood. He began his apprenticeship at the age of twelve. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked as a technician in his master's shop until he started his own Lin Nanxing fishhook shop at the age of thirty-seven. All seven members of his family participated in the labor, each mastering a link in the manufacturing of fishhooks.

　　Lin Gongjiao has been making fishhooks for over fifty years. Through painstaking research and accumulating rich experience little by little, he has created a unique operating method, especially in the crucial process of firing and tempering the hooks.

　　At the end of 1955, during the cooperative movement, Lin Gongjiao signed up to join the handicraft production cooperative. At that time, the cooperative's leaders considered how to enable this renowned brand producer to play a good role within the cooperative and to bring the quality of all cooperative products up to the level of renowned brands.

　　The cooperative leadership paid attention to uniting and educating Lin Gongjiao. Economically, they cared about his income. Lin Gongjiao's family originally had seven main and auxiliary laborers participating in production, and the cooperative made proper arrangements for all of them, increasing his family's income compared to before joining the cooperative. In addition to his deserved wages, Lin Gongjiao himself also received a 20 yuan technical allowance to encourage him to continue researching technology and training apprentices. In terms of daily life, the cooperative also gave Lin Gongjiao cordial care, making him deeply feel the warmth of collective life. Politically, they helped him to raise his awareness and remove his ideological burdens in various ways. Lin Gongjiao was originally a small business owner and was mistakenly classified as a capitalist during the "Five-Anti" campaign. At that time, he himself also identified himself as a capitalist. After joining the cooperative, the cooperative removed this label from him, recognized him as a laborer, and actively guided him to participate in some political activities, helping him to establish the idea of "taking the cooperative as his home."

　　Because of Lin Gongjiao's own hard work, he gradually established prestige among the cooperative members. Soon, the members unanimously elected him and his second son, Lin Jinhui, as directors; his eldest son, Lin Bingsheng, was also elected as the workshop director. Lin Gongjiao said very emotionally, "I used to think I was a capitalist and a 'child bride' in the cooperative. Now I understand that my past thoughts were wrong. The cooperative is my home, and I am also the master of the cooperative."

　　The bright path of cooperativization illuminated Lin Gongjiao's heart, but Lin Gongjiao still had a concern: he thought that he was over sixty years old, and after a few more years, he would not be able to work anymore. Would the cooperative still want him? What would he do for a living if he taught his skills to others? He recalled that he had taught an apprentice before, but this apprentice ran to Hong Kong to impersonate the Lin Nanxing brand, almost ruining his livelihood. Therefore, he was full of worries. This concern of his was known to Yu Hua, the director of the Xiamen Municipal Handicraft Bureau. Yu Hua said to him, "As long as you contribute to the country and the cooperative, you will be supported in your old age even if you can't work." This removed his last concern. That night, when he returned home, he said to his wife, "I will never have to worry about food or clothing in the second half of my life. I must continue to study technology hard and teach the technology to young people." Since then, he has openly shared many of the skills he has accumulated over the decades, and his enthusiasm has become even higher. In the second half of last year, he was rated as a municipal advanced producer.

　　In order to bring the quality of all cooperative products up to the level of renowned brands, the cooperative's leaders retained Lin Gongjiao's original labor organization after he joined the cooperative and carried out production as before. After careful research, they also adjusted the labor force of the entire cooperative and asked Lin Gongjiao to take apprentices. After he unreservedly passed on his decades of production experience to everyone, the cooperative further boldly reformed the entire cooperative's products according to the production methods of renowned brands. With the joint efforts of Lin Gongjiao and all the cooperative members, the quality of all cooperative products was finally improved to the level of renowned brands in just a few months.

　　Throughout this process, the cooperative leadership patiently educated Lin Gongjiao on the one hand, so that he openly shared his technology without any concerns; on the other hand, they also used vivid examples to educate other members, so that they humbly learned from Lin Gongjiao. When the cooperative began to provide special care to Lin Gongjiao in terms of economy and daily life, some members expressed disapproval. Some people were also unwilling to learn advanced operating techniques and unwilling to change their original production habits. Some members said, "The director is biased and takes better care of small business owners than handicraftsmen." Some members said, "Lin Nanxing and his sons have all become directors and workshop directors. The fishhook workshop has become the world of Lin Nanxing." Some members who were from small business owner backgrounds also said, "What's so great about Lin Nanxing? My products also had some reputation in the past." The cooperative leadership paid attention to educating the members to respect master craftsmen, learn advanced technology, and improve product quality, explaining that learning advanced production technology is the common interest of all members. They also used many facts for education. For example, they marked Lin Gongjiao's and his son's products and another master craftsman "Lao Huiji's" products with two different marks: "Lin Nanxing's" was marked with the character "具" (ju), and "Lao Huiji's" was marked with the character "渔" (yu). After the fishermen knew these marks, they bought the ones with the character "具" without looking at them, and if they had the character "渔", they would pick and choose, and often not want them. This vivid example made the members realize the importance of learning advanced technology. At the same time, the members also recalled that in the past, the cooperative had stopped work for two or three months because the product quality was poor and could not be sold, and everyone had to go up the mountains to cut firewood to maintain their livelihood. Since Lin Gongjiao joined the cooperative, the situation has gradually improved due to the emphasis on improving product quality. This year alone, the foreign trade contracts signed with the import and export company reached 300 boxes, which became in short supply, and the income of the members has also increased from an average of more than 30 yuan per person per month last year to more than 50 yuan now. These many facts prove that the party and the government's practice of protecting and promoting renowned brands is correct. Many members overcame their conservative ideas and resistance, thus setting off a wave of learning advanced technology in the cooperative, ensuring the improvement of the quality of all cooperative products.

    从一户名牌货到全社名牌货	林竞生
    厦门市林南兴号的鱼钩，在福建沿海和南洋一带渔民中很有信誉。渔民说：“林南兴的鱼钩放在海里，鱼只要从钩边经过就会上钩。”
    林南兴号的业主林拱交小时候家庭贫困，十二岁就从师学艺，出师以后就在师父店中当技工，一直到三十七岁那年才自己经营林南兴号鱼钩店。全家大小七口都参加劳动，分别掌握制造鱼钩的各个环节。
    林拱交制造鱼钩已经有五十多年了。由于苦心钻研，一点一滴地积累了丰富的经验，特别是在烧炒钩这一关键工序中，他创造出了一套独特的操作方法。
    1955年底，在合作化运动中，林拱交报名参加了手工业生产合作社。当时，合作社的领导人员就考虑如何使这个名牌货的生产者，在合作社内很好地发挥作用，使全社产品质量都达到名牌货的水平。
    合作社领导方面注意对林拱交进行了团结教育工作。在经济上，关心他的收入。林拱交一家原来有七个主要劳动力和辅助劳动力参加生产，合作社都加以妥善安排，使他一家的收入比入社前有了增加。对林拱交本人，除了他应得的工资以外，还给他二十元技术津贴，以鼓励他继续研究技术，培养徒弟。在日常生活方面，合作社也给林拱交亲切的关怀，使他深深感到集体生活的温暖。在政治上，多方帮助他提高觉悟，解除他的思想包袱。林拱交原是个小业主，“五反”时误列为资本家，那时，他自己也认定自己是资本家。入了社以后，合作社替他除去这顶帽子，承认他是劳动者，并且积极地引导他参加一些政治活动，帮助他树立“以社为家”的思想。
    由于林拱交自己辛勤劳动，他逐渐地在社员中建立了威信。不久，社员们一致推选他和他的次子林金辉当理事；长子林炳生也当选了车间主任。林拱交非常感动地说：“我过去都以为我是资本家，在合作社是‘童养媳’，现在才明白我过去的想法错了。合作社是我的家，我也是合作社的主人。”
    合作化光明的道路照亮了林拱交的心，但是林拱交还有一桩心事：他想到自己是六十多岁的人了，再干几年，不能劳动了，合作社还要我吗？把技术教了别人，到那时吃饭怎么办呢？他回想到以前教了一个徒弟，这个徒弟却跑到香港去，假冒林南兴的招牌，险些打破了他的饭碗。因此，他顾虑重重。他这件心事，被厦门市手工业局局长于华知道了。于华就对他说：“只要你对国家、对合作社有贡献，将来不能劳动了，也包养你到老。”这么一说，把他最后的一个顾虑解除了。当晚回家，他就对老婆说：“下半辈子再也不愁吃，不愁穿了，我一定要好好地继续钻研技术，把技术教给年青人。”从此，他公开了自己几十年来积累的许多技艺，积极性也更加高涨起来。去年下半年，他被评上了市先进生产者。
    合作社的领导人员为了使全社的产品都能达到名牌货的水平，在林拱交入社以后，就把他原来的劳动组织保留下来，照原样进行生产；经过慎重的研究以后，又把全社的劳动力进行了调整，并且请林拱交带徒弟。当他把积累数十年的生产经验无保留地传授给大家以后，社里又进一步把全社的产品大胆地按名牌货的生产方法进行改革。在林拱交和全体社员的共同努力下，终于在短短几个月的时间内，把全社产品提高到名牌货的水平。
    在这整个过程中，合作社领导人员一方面耐心地教育了林拱交，使他无所顾虑地公开了技术；另一方面，也用生动的例子教育了其他社员，使他们虚心向林拱交学习。当合作社开始在经济上、日常生活等方面给予林拱交特殊照顾的时候，部分社员曾经表示不服气。有些人还不愿意学习先进操作技术，不愿意改变自己原有的生产习惯。有的社员说：“主任有偏心，对手工业工人的照顾比不上对小业主的照顾。”有的社员说：“林南兴父子都当了理事、车间主任，鱼钩车间成了林南兴号的天下。”有的小业主出身的社员还说：“林南兴有什么了不起，我过去的产品也有一些名气。”合作社领导方面就注意对社员进行了尊重老师傅、学习先进技术、提高产品质量的教育，说明学习先进生产技术，是全体社员共同的利益。他们还用许多事实来进行教育。如将林拱交父子的产品和另一个老师傅“老回记”的产品分别作上两种记号：“林南兴”的铸上“具”字，“老回记”的铸上“渔”字。渔民知道这个记号以后，只要是有“具”字的不看就买走了，如果是有“渔”字的，就东挑西拣，还常常不要。这件生动的事例，使社员们认识了学习先进技术的重要。同时，社员们还回想到：过去社里曾经因为产品质量差，销不出去，而停工两三个月，大家只好上山砍柴维持生活；自从林拱交入社以后，由于重视改进产品质量，情况才逐渐好转，今年仅是同进出口公司签订的外销合同就达三百箱，成了供不应求，社员收入也由去年每人每月平均三十多元，提高到现在的五十多元。这许多事实，证明党和政府保护和发扬名牌货的做法是对的。许多社员克服了保守思想和抵触情绪，因而在合作社内掀起了学习先进技术的热潮，保证了全社产品质量的提高。
