	Mark Twain loathed bank owners his entire life. He said that these people “lend you an umbrella on a sunny day, but force you to return it the moment it rains.”

	He said that a big bank owner was blind in his left eye and had a glass eye fitted in Paris, which looked exactly like a real one, making him very proud. One day he said to Mark Twain, "If you can guess which of my eyes is glass, I'll gladly lose five thousand dollars to you." Mark Twain said, "Of course, it's the left one; only that one still reveals a little compassion, a little humanity."

	One day he borrowed a book from a banker next door. The man said, "Certainly, but I have a rule: you can only read the book in my study." Later, one day, the banker asked Mark Twain to borrow his lawnmower. Mark Twain said, "Certainly, but I also have a rule: you can only push it on this patch of lawn in my yard."

	At a banquet, he satirized people who made long, rambling speeches: "Once I went to church to listen to a sermon by a pastor. At first, I thought he spoke with great power, and I intended to empty all the money in my pockets into the collection plate. But ten minutes later, he still hadn't finished, and I changed my mind, deciding to keep the whole dollar bills and only donate the loose change. Another ten minutes passed, and I didn't want to give a dime. But the pastor on the stage still didn't end. By the time he finally finished and the collection plate was passed to me, I was so angry that not only did I not donate anything, but purely out of disgust for him, I took two dollars from the donations."

	Mark Twain liked to have his characters speak in the village dialect of the American West. His wife always felt that this was not very elegant and often advised him to delete those rough and vivid words. One day, Mark Twain was shaving in the morning and accidentally cut himself. He couldn't help but burst into a long tirade. After he finished cursing, his wife repeated his curses exactly as he had said them. Mark Twain, like a connoisseur, calmly appraised: "Dear, you've mastered the words I used, but you lack my intonation."

	In his later years, Mark Twain was walking in the park one day when he met a little girl. She asked in the tone of an admirer, "Sir, may I walk with you?" Mark Twain was very happy, and he told the little girl stories for a full hour. When it was time to part, he said to the little girl, "Go home now. When you grow up, you can tell your friends that you once walked with Mark Twain!"

	"Mark Twain?" The little girl was stunned. This unfamiliar name seemed to disappoint her greatly; she had thought she was walking with the famous circus performer Buffalo Bill!

    马克·吐温点滴
    柱父
    马克·吐温生平顶讨厌银行老板。他说，这种人“晴天把雨伞借给你，雨天他马上就逼着你送回来。”
    他说，有个银行大老板左眼瞎了，他在巴黎配了个玻璃眼球，跟真的一模一样，非常得意。有一天他对马克·吐温说：“要是你猜得出我哪只眼睛是玻璃的，我情愿输给你五千块钱。”马克·吐温说：“当然是左眼啦，只有那只还稍稍流露着一点儿慈悲，一点儿人情味。”
    有一天他向隔壁一位银行家借一本书。那人说：“可以，不过我有个规矩，书，您只能在我书房里看。”后来有一天那个银行家向马克·吐温借剪草器，马克·吐温说：“可以，不过我也有个规矩，您只能在我院子里这块草坪上推。”
    在一次宴会上，他讽刺讲话冗长啰嗦的人说：“有回我进教堂听一个牧师说教。最初我觉得他讲得很有力量，打算在捐献的时候，尽我口袋里的钱都掏出来。可是十分钟以后他还没讲完，我改主意了，决定留下整元的钞票，只把零碎钱捐出来。又过了十分钟，我干脆一毛也不想拔了。可是台上的牧师还不结束。等到他终于讲完，收款的盘子递到我面前的时候，我气得不但没捐什么，纯粹出于表示我对他的厌恶，还从捐款里拿了两块钱。”
    马克·吐温喜欢让他的人物说些美国西部的村话。他的妻子总觉得那样做不大雅，常常劝他删掉那些粗犷生动的语言。有一天，马克·吐温早晨刮脸，一不小心刮破了，他情不自禁破口大骂了半晌。等他骂完，他的妻子也照样把他骂的话重复一遍。马克·吐温像一位鉴赏家那么冷静地品评说：“亲爱的，你掌握了我用的字眼儿，可就是缺乏我那个腔调。”
    马克·吐温晚年的时候，有一天他到公园里散步，碰见个小姑娘。她用一个崇拜者的口吻问：“先生，我可以跟您一道走走吗？”马克·吐温很高兴，一路上他还足足给那小姑娘讲了一个钟头的故事。等分手的时候，他对小姑娘说：“家去吧。等你长大了的时候，你可以告诉你的朋友说，你曾经跟马克·吐温一同散步过！”
    “马克·吐温？”小姑娘听了一楞。这个陌生的名字好像很叫她失望，本来她以为跟她散步的是著名的马戏团演员巴费罗·别勒呢！
