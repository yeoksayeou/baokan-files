Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, recently composed "Ten Poems in Seven-Character Verse Joyfully Composed on Visiting the Soviet Union." The full text is as follows:

	Knowing only a little, I speak of the Soviet Union,
	With affectionate feelings, I wish to express my thoughts,
	Heaven's treasures and abundant resources are endless to discuss,
	Forgive me if my descriptions are incomplete.

	Fifteen republics united in a federation,
	Brothers and sisters living together in harmony,
	Sharing gains and losses, working with all their strength,
	Construction is made easier in a thousand ways.

	The people's democratic dictatorship began here,
	Forty years of arduous struggle,
	With rich experiences of successes and failures,
	Teaching people to learn from this example.

	Forty years is not a short time,
	Marxism-Leninism was pioneered by them,
	Universally applicable,
	The world should recognize them as mentors.

	Thirty years of construction, many achievements,
	How does it compare to capitalist countries?
	Not just numbers provide clear evidence,
	Science and technology are catching up head-on!

	Not only a great nation's style,
	But also practicing the world for the common good,
	The lofty example of internationalism,
	Guiding people towards a great harmony.

	Abundant resources and vast land, unparalleled in the world,
	Spanning two hemispheres, Europe and Asia,
	Millions of people united in effort,
	Undertaking great plans for humanity!

	A magnificent spirit, unparalleled in the world,
	Tunneling through mountains, connecting seas to lakes,
	From this, we know nothing is impossible in the world,
	It all depends on whether people are great heroes.

	National strength is abundant, it is certain,
	Defense is well-prepared, there is no doubt,
	To whom will peace and victory ultimately belong?
	The wheels of history will tell.

	Sincere affection grows deeper day by day,
	Feelings as vast as the sea, a thousand fathoms deep,
	Sino-Soviet friendship is everyone's wish,
	May this friendship forever linger in hundreds of millions of hearts.

    李济深
    新华社讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深近作“访问苏联喜赋七言十首”，全文如下：
    一知半解话苏联，
    有感情怀意欲宣，
    天宝物华谈不尽，
    休嫌陈说不周全。
    十五联邦合共和，
    弟兄友爱一般过，
    盈亏无有通全力，
    建设千般便利多。
    工农专政此开端，
    奋斗艰难四十年，
    错误成功经验富，
    教人由此得师传。
    四十年华不少时，
    马列主义肇先知，
    放之四海而皆准，
    世界都应认导师。
    建设卅年成就多，
    较之资本国如何？
    不徒数字资明证，
    科技迎头也赶过！
    岂惟泱泱大国风，
    实行天下要为公，
    国际主义崇高范，
    导向人群到大同。
    物丰地广世无俦，
    欧亚横跨两半球，
    万众一心齐努力，
    担当人类大谋猷！
    魄力恢宏世所无，
    凿山通海海通湖，
    从知世上无难事，
    只在人为大丈夫。
    国力充盈信有之，
    国防有备更无疑，
    和平胜利终谁属，
    历史车轮自告知。
    真挚隆情与日深，
    情弥如海万千寻，
    中苏友好人人愿，
    友谊长萦亿万心。
