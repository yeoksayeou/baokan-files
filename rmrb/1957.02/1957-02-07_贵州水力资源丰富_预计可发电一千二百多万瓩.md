Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, February 6th: Guizhou Province possesses abundant hydropower reserves. If utilized for electricity generation, it is estimated to produce over 12 million kilowatts of power. This is the preliminary conclusion reached by the Guizhou Surveying Division of the Chengdu Hydroelectric Power Design Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry after conducting a general survey of Guizhou's major rivers.

As of the end of January, the Guizhou Surveying Division, after ten months of effort, has basically ascertained the hydropower resources of the province's main waterways. They have identified 191 potential locations for hydroelectric power stations along twelve rivers, including the Wujiang River, the Nanpan River, and the Beipan River. Many of these locations have a potential generating capacity of 500,000 to 1,000,000 kilowatts. The Wujiang River, known for its perilous terrain, is one of the main tributaries of the Yangtze River. The river features rapid currents, steep gorges, and towering mountains with precipitous cliffs on both sides. During this survey, eighty-five promising hydroelectric station sites were discovered here. In a particular section of the Nanpan River, there is a short stretch where the natural water level difference reaches over 210 meters. Surveys have indicated that constructing a hydroelectric station there could generate 1.56 million kilowatts.

    贵州水力资源丰富
    预计可发电一千二百多万瓩
    据新华社贵阳6日电　贵州省水力蕴蓄量丰富，如果用来发电，预计能发一千二百多万瓩电力。这是电力工业部成都水力发电设计院贵州勘测处对贵州主要河流进行普查以后得出的初步结论。
    到1月底为止，贵州勘测处经过十个月的努力，已经基本上摸清全省主要河道的水力资源。从乌江、南盘江、北盘江等十二条河，找到一百九十一个可以建设水电站的地址，其中不少地方发电能力可以达到五十万到一百万瓩。素称天险的乌江，是长江主要支流之一。这里沿江滩险水急，山高谷深，两岸多是陡岩峻壁。这次普查中，在这里发现八十五个较好的水电站地址。在南盘江某处有一段很短的河道，水位自然落差达到二百一十多公尺，经勘测，认为如果建设一个水电站，能发电一百五十六万瓩。
