Problems in the Township
晓东

In July 1956, Laiyang County, Shandong Province, carried out the work of abolishing districts and merging townships, abolishing all thirteen districts in the county and merging one hundred and fifty-four townships into thirty-five townships (towns). After the townships were merged, township committees of the Chinese Communist Party were established, township people's committees were reorganized, and cadres were re-adjusted and equipped. However, the township organizations were not able to concentrate their efforts to strengthen the leadership of rural Party organizations and agricultural producers' cooperatives as a result. What is the reason? In mid-December 1956, I visited nine cadres from Heluo Township and Guanzhuang Township in Laiyang County, and they provided the answer.

Fewer Cadres, Even Fewer Key Members

The township after the abolishment of districts and the merging of townships has to handle the affairs that used to be handled by the district and township level organizations. But what is the situation of the cadres? Before the abolishment of districts and merging of townships in Laiyang County, the thirteen districts had a total of 272 cadres, and the one hundred and fifty-four townships had a total of 691 cadres, totaling 963 people. The current thirty-five townships (towns) have a total of 399 cadres, of which only 123 cadres from the original districts remain in the townships, and most of the key members (such as district party secretaries, etc.) have been transferred to work in county-level agencies.

The township cadres generally have some experience in rural work and also have contact with the peasant masses. However, their educational level is relatively low and their work efficiency is not high. Among the ten township cadres in Guanzhuang Township, only two have the equivalent of a senior primary school level, and the rest are at a junior primary school level, or have just come out of literacy crash courses. It is impossible to do the increasingly heavy grass-roots work well by relying on them.

"A Thousand Threads from Above, a Single Needle Below"

The situation of township cadres is not adapted to the needs of rural work development; judging from the variety of work tasks imposed on the township cadres by higher-level leading organs, the township cadres are also "unable to cope." There are eighty-nine county-level agencies, departments and enterprises in Laiyang County, and forty-seven of these units can almost directly assign tasks to the township. Some enterprises also assign a lot of tasks to the township cadres. There are many superior leading departments, so there are many meetings. There are few township cadres, and going to meetings in superior departments takes up a lot of time. The township party secretary and township head have to go to the county for meetings at least twice a month. Comrade Jiang Zhongde, the secretary of the Heluo Township Communist Youth League Committee, also concurrently handles public security and militia work. In September and October last year, he went to the county party committee, the county Communist Youth League Committee, the Public Security Bureau, and the Military Service Bureau for meetings at least six times, which took twenty-five days.

There are also many training classes, and many of them require township cadres to participate. The county reserve military service training class requires two township cadres to participate at the same time, one as an instructor (militia work cadre) and one as a company commander (township head). The county party committee trains party membership applicants, and the township cadres have to lead them; when training cooperative chairmen and accountants, the township cadres have to lead them; the county cultural center trains activists in cooperative New Year and Spring Festival cultural activities, and it is also required that township cadres lead them. There are also many temporary things that township cadres are grabbed to do. When the Highway Bureau needs to press sand on the highway, the township cadres have to lead the laborers to divide the sections on the highway; when the county sets up telephone lines, the township cadres have to lead the laborers to dig pits and plant telephone poles; when the Tax Bureau wants to implement tax collection work, the township cadres have to find the cooperative chairman or accountant to hold a meeting; when the oil and fat group pre-purchases hogs, the township cadres have to find the cooperative chairman to sign contracts and make plans; when the construction department uses stones, the township cadres have to find laborers to transport them; when the agencies and enterprises eat sweet potatoes, the township cadres have to allocate them to the agricultural producers' cooperatives according to the amount. Xinhua Bookstore also asks the township cadres to sell books on their behalf. Many things cannot be done with just a word or a hand, they require strength and time. For example, when the county forestry department wants the township head to lead people to investigate how many tree seeds can be produced in the whole township, Sun Piqing, the deputy township head of Heluo Township, led five people to investigate which are male trees and which are female trees all over the mountains and fields. Some female trees also have to be divided into "how many years old," and how many seeds they can produce, and tags have to be hung, etc., which took more than a month at once.

The large number of documents, statistical tables, and investigation materials is also a great pressure on the township. According to the statistics of Heluo Township, the county people's committee alone has about sixty numbered documents every month. There were sixty-four in November. On December 12, eighteen came in one day, including two copies of the county party committee's instructions and opinions on the work, the Military Service Bureau's instructions on reserve military service training, the Communist Youth League County Committee's opinions on mobilizing young people to learn technology, the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's instructions, the County Agriculture Bureau's notice of a meeting, oil situation, "Election Work Bulletin," "Shandong Administrative Bulletin," and so on. They said: "There are many higher-level agencies, and there are many people. The instructions and documents they compile are long and numerous, who can read them?" When the documents come, first see if there is a notice, so as not to delay going to the higher-level meetings. Many documents are never read. For example, the provincial people's committee's "Shandong Administrative Bulletin" from the first to the thirty-first issue in 1956, the provincial Civil Affairs Department's "Civil Affairs Bulletin" with a total of seven issues and fifty-four copies, the provincial Agriculture Department's "Shandong Agriculture Bulletin" with a total of five issues and seventeen copies, and the "Information Bulletin on Propaganda Work" with a total of four issues, none of these documents have been read by anyone. However, they must be registered, stored, and prepared for recycling. There are twenty-two kinds of statistical reports on agricultural cooperatives and agricultural production from the Provincial Statistics Bureau alone. The Oil and Fat Company's verification table on the planting area, output, and unified purchase volume of peanuts in each township and cooperative has twenty-eight items, both large and small. On December 18, Guanzhuang Township received a "Rural Investigation Outline" from the county party committee, requiring it to be completed in January 1957. The content is: 1. Investigation of economic policies, including farmers' burden, price policy, unified purchase and sales, and market management. 2. Investigation of farmers' actual income and improvement of living conditions, including the comparison of three types of cooperatives and various types of households, the reasons for the comparison, the comparison of total township and cooperative sideline income, the comparison of farmers' purchasing power, and the implementation of the "five guarantees" policy. 3. Investigation of the increase in livestock, pigs, oil, and meat production, including the comparison of the increase and decrease of horses, donkeys, mules, cattle, and pigs, and the comparison of farmers' consumption of meat, vermicelli, and tofu. 4. Investigation of the 1957 agricultural production plan. 5. Investigation of social security issues, the experience of Party branches leading cooperatives, etc. There are also many small items in these items. Among them, twelve items of numbers and situations are required to be compared with 1956, 1949, and 1936, and many numbers are for the whole township. Such a complex rural survey requires township cadres to complete it in more than a month. Even if the township cadres do nothing and specialize in surveys, it may be difficult to do well.

Impact from Below

The things from above are numerous and difficult to cope with, and the impact from below also makes it difficult for them to deal with. After agricultural cooperation, the relations of production have changed. In the first year of running the cooperatives, there was no experience, and there were many problems. Cooperative cadres often come to the township to ask for help in solving various problems in their work, which is inevitable. From the production and distribution of agricultural cooperatives to the family disputes of cooperative members, discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, children not supporting the elderly, brothers dividing families, couples quarreling and divorcing, withdrawing from marriage, etc., are also concentrated in the township for resolution; demobilized soldiers, disabled soldiers, family members of martyrs, family members of soldiers, family members of cadres, etc., often ask township cadres to solve difficulties for them. According to the statistics of Heluo Township, there is at least one case on average every day, and sometimes several cases a day. Some of these matters can be dealt with on the same day, while others require investigation and handling in the villages, which often takes several days to resolve.

The masses also come to the township to handle the following matters: transferring household registration, registering for marriage, needing cloth tickets for funerals and weddings, needing oil tickets, going to the township for inspection to slaughter old and disabled livestock, obtaining permission to slaughter certificates, and even engaging in sideline production, remittances from outside, sending things, the masses buying bean cakes to feed piglets, selling piglets, carpenters selling wooden ?, cadres eating at farmers' homes and returning food stamps, going to the grain department to exchange grain, primary school teachers buying oil to eat, and even the masses buying pork, etc., all large and small matters require township cadres to issue certificates.

Some things must be handled by the masses in the township, and some things are unnecessary regulations and restrictions made by some departments above, which make it necessary for the masses to run to the township. This creates many inconveniences for the masses, which is not only not beneficial to the masses and the country, but also increases a lot of chaos in the work of the township.

What to do?

In the face of this situation in the township, what should we do? The Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken measures to gradually solve this problem. It seems that the solutions are roughly in the following three aspects:

First, it is necessary to enable the township cadres, especially the leading cadres, to form a leading core, and to make the township's party and government organizations sound and able to carry out their work independently. This requires the higher-level leading organs to be determined to take out a group of strong cadres to strengthen the township organizations in the reorganization work. The Laiyang Prefectural Committee has transferred more than 170 cadres from directly affiliated agencies, equivalent to deputy secretaries and deputy heads of district committees, and successively sent them to the townships to take up leading positions around January 20. Each county in the Laiyang Special Zone will transfer some deputy ministers, deputy county heads, and bureau chiefs to the townships to do leadership work. Strive to have a cadre equivalent to the secretary of the district party committee or the deputy minister of the county to serve as the township leader in each township. This approach is very beneficial to strengthening the work of the township.

Second, if the leading organs and enterprise departments above the county level are numerous, if the agencies that should be abolished in the streamlining of agencies are abolished, the agencies that should be merged are merged, the agencies that should be reduced are reduced, reducing meetings, documents and statistical reports, each department does not send "errands" to the township and does not pull township cadres indiscriminately, and cancels some unnecessary regulations and restrictions on the lives of the masses, etc., for reducing the pressure on the township, establishing the working order of the township, "liberating" the strength of township cadres, so that they can concentrate their main strength on leading the cooperatives to develop production, caring about and solving the people's life problems, is of decisive significance. This requires a lot of careful research. The Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stipulates that the departments, committees and government departments and bureaus of the county party committee generally should not convene meetings of township cadres, but may convene meetings of township cadres by the county party committee and the government according to a certain stage of work, and uniformly deploy various tasks; generally do not use written guidance for the township work, important issues should be conveyed at meetings, or send main cadres to the township to convey; restrict tables and reports; enterprise departments are not allowed to engage in business work through administrative organizations, and the township party committee and the people's committee may regularly check the implementation of the party's guidelines and policies. These measures are beneficial to overcoming bureaucracy and subjectivism.

Third, after the township cadres are strengthened, they should improve the leadership methods of the township, establish a normal working order; strengthen collective leadership, divide responsibilities, and change the "all-in-one" leadership situation; correctly give play to the role of various departments and township committees, and the resolution of the masses' affairs issues should be decentralized as much as possible, which is also an important issue.

The problems in the township are very complicated. After agricultural cooperation, strengthening the work of the township is more important and urgent. The experience in this area needs to be studied and created. Here, we only raise these issues for reference in research.

    乡里的问题
    晓东
    山东省莱阳县于1956年7月进行了撤区并乡的工作，将全县十三个区撤掉，将一百五十四个乡合并为三十五个乡（镇）。乡合并后，都成立了中共乡委员会和改建了乡人民委员会，重新调整配备了干部。但是，乡的组织并没有因此能够集中力量加强对农村党组织和农业生产合作社的领导。原因何在呢？我在1956年的12月中旬，访问了莱阳县河洛乡和官庄乡的九名干部，他们给做了解答。
    干部少些，骨干更少
    撤区并乡以后的乡，它要办过去区和乡两级组织所办的事。但是干部的状况怎样呢？莱阳县在撤区并乡之前，十三个区共有干部二百七十二名，一百五十四个乡共有干部六百九十一人，共合九百六十三人。而现在的三十五个乡（镇），共有干部三百九十九人，其中原来区的干部只有一百二十三人留在乡里工作，大部分骨干（如区委书记等）都上调至县级机关工作。
    乡里的干部，一般的是有些农村工作经验的，和农民群众也有联系。但是他们的文化水平比较低，办事效率也不高。官庄乡的十名乡干部，只有两名相当于高小水平，其余的都是初小水平，或刚从扫盲速成班出来的。依靠他们，是无法把日益繁重的基层工作作好的。
    “上边千条线，下边一根针”
    就乡干部的状况和农村工作发展的需要来看，是不相适应的；就上级领导机关所加于乡干部身上的各种各样的工作任务来看，乡干部也是“招架不了”的。莱阳县级机关、部门和企业单位就有八十九个，而其中四十七个单位，差不多都可以直接指派乡里做事情，有些企业单位，给乡干部分派的事情也不少。上边领导部门多，开会就多，乡干部人少，光到上级部门开会，就用去了很多的时间。乡委书记、乡长，每月至少要到县里开两次会。河洛乡团委书记姜忠德同志，因兼公安、武装工作，去年9、10月间，到县委、团县委、公安局、兵役局开会至少是六次，用去了二十五天。
    训练班也不少，而且许多训练班是要乡干部参加的，县预备兵役训练班，就要两个乡干部同时参加，一个任指导员（武装工作干部），一个任连长（乡长）。县委训练建党对象，要乡干部带领，社长、会计决分训练班，要乡干部带领，县文化馆训练合作社里新年、春节文娱活动的积极分子，也要求让乡干部带领。临时抓乡干部干事情的也很多，公路局要在公路上压沙，就要乡干部带领民工到公路上划分地段；县架设电话线，要乡干部领着民工挖坑、栽电线杆；税务局要贯彻税收工作，要乡干部给找合作社社长或会计来开会；油脂小组预购毛猪，要乡干部给找社长来订合同、订计划；建筑部门用石头，要乡干部给找民工运输；机关、企业部门吃地瓜，要乡干部按数给分配到农业生产合作社里。新华书店也叫乡干部给代卖书籍。许多事情也不是一动嘴或一动手就可以办完的，需要力量，需要时间。如县林业部门要乡长领人调查全乡能出多少树种子，河洛乡的副乡长孙丕卿就领着五个人，漫山遍野调查哪是公树、哪是母树。有些母树还得分出“几岁”，能出多少种子，还要挂上牌子等等，一下子用去了一个多月。
    文件、统计表、调查材料之多，对乡也是个很大的压力。就河洛乡的统计，仅县人民委员会编号的文件，每月都在六十件左右。11月份是六十四件。12月12日一天就来了十八件，其中有县委关于工作的指示意见两份、兵役局的预备兵役集训的指示、团县委发动青年学技术的意见、县供销合作社的指示、县农业局开会的通知，打油情况、“选举工作简报”、“山东行政公报”等等。他们说：“上级机关多，人也多，编的指示、文件又多又长，谁能看得了？”来了文件，先看有没有通知，别耽误了到上级开会就行。许多文件从来不看。如省人民委员会的“山东行政公报”1956年自第一期到三十一期，省民政厅的“民政简报”共七期五十四份，省农业厅的“山东农业简报”共五期十七份，“宣传工作情况通报”共四期，这些文件没有一个人看过。但是都要登记保存，准备回收。统计表报仅省统计局对农业合作社和农业生产的统计就有二十二种。而油脂公司对各乡、社花生种植面积、产量、统购量核实表一种，大小项目就有二十八个。官庄乡12月18日收到县委一份“农村调查提纲”，要求1957年1月完成。内容是：1、经济政策的调查，包括农民负担、价格政策、统购统销、市场管理。2、农民的实际收入与生活改善情况的调查，包括三种类型社、各种类型户的对比、原因，全乡、合作社副业收入对比，农民购买力对比，“五保”政策贯彻情况等。3、牲畜、猪、油、肉增产情况调查，包括马、驴、骡、牛、猪增减对比，农民食用肉、粉条、豆腐对比等。4、1957年农业生产计划的调查。5、社会治安问题的调查，党支部领导合作社的经验等。这些项目里还有许多小项目。其中有十二项数字、情况是要求1956年与1949年与1936年作对比，许多数字又是全乡的。这样一个复杂的农村调查要乡干部在一个多月的时间来完成，就是乡干部什么都不干，专门作调查，恐怕也难干好。
    来自下面的冲击
    来自上面的事情千头万绪，招架不了，而来自下面的冲击，也使他们难于应付。农业合作化之后，生产关系改变了，头一年办社没有经验，问题也就多，社干部经常到乡里来要求帮助解决工作中的各种问题，这是必然的。从农业社的生产、分配一直到社员的家庭纠纷，婆媳不和、子不养老、兄弟分家、夫妻吵架闹离婚、退婚等等，也都集中到乡里来解决；复员军人、残废军人、烈属、军属、干部家属等，也经常找乡干部给解决困难。据河洛乡统计，平均每天至少一起，有时一天数起。这些事，有的当天可以处理完，有的需要到村子里调查处理，往往几天才能解决得了。
    群众到乡来办的事还有下面这些：迁移户口、结婚登记、丧生嫁娶要布票、要油票、屠宰老残牲口要到乡里检查，领取准许宰杀证明，甚至搞副业生产、外面汇来款、寄来东西、群众买点豆饼喂小猪、卖小猪、木匠卖木?、干部在农民家吃饭还给的粮票、到粮食部门换粮、小学教员买油吃、甚至群众买猪肉等等一应大小事情都要乡干部给开证明条。
    有些事，是群众必须到乡里来办的，有些事是上面某些部门做了不必要的规定和限制，使得群众不得不往乡里跑。这就给群众造成许多不方便，不仅对群众、对国家没有什么好处，反而给乡的工作增加了不少的忙乱。
    怎么办？
    面对着乡的这种情况，怎么办呢？中共莱阳地委已采取措施，求得逐步地解决这个问题。办法看来大体有如下三方面：
    一、要使乡的干部，特别是领导干部，能形成一个领导核心，并使乡的党、政组织健全起来，能够独立地进行工作。这就需要上级领导机关在整编工作中，决心拿出一批强有力的干部充实乡的组织。莱阳地委已从直属机关抽调一百七十多名相当于区委正副书记、正副区长的干部，于1月20日前后，陆续派到乡里担任领导工作。莱阳专区各县将抽调部分副部长、副县长和局长到乡里做领导工作。争取每乡有一个相当于区委书记或县副部长级的干部担任乡的领导职务。这种做法，对加强乡的工作大有好处。
    二、县以上的领导机关和企业部门林立，如果在精简机构中该撤销的撤销，该合并的合并，该缩小的缩小，减少会议、文件和统计表报，各部门不要到乡里乱派“差使”和乱拉乡干部，取消对群众生活中一些不必要的规定和限制等，对于减少乡的压力，建立乡的工作秩序，“解放”乡干部的力量，使他们能够集中主要力量领导合作社发展生产，关心与解决群众生活问题，是有决定性意义的。这是需要下工夫做一番缜密的研究。中共莱阳地委规定县委各部、委和政府各科、局，一般不要召开乡干部会议，可按一定工作阶段，由县委和政府召开乡干部会，统一部署各种工作；对乡一般不要用文字指导工作，重要问题开会传达，或派主要干部下乡传达；限制表报；不允许企业部门通过行政组织搞业务工作，乡党委和人民委员会，可定期检查党的方针政策执行的情况。这些措施对于克服官僚主义、主观主义是有利的。
    三、乡干部加强之后，应当改善乡的领导方法，建立正常的工作秩序；加强集体领导，分工负责，改变“一揽子”的领导现状；正确地发挥部门和乡各种委员会的作用，群众的事务问题的解决要尽量下放，这也是一个重要的问题。
    乡里的问题很复杂，农业合作化之后，加强乡的工作更显得重要与迫切，这方面的经验是需要研究和创造的。这里仅仅提出这些问题来，供作研究的参考。
