    A Model of Peaceful Coexistence
    People once called the train traveling between Moscow and Helsinki the "Peace and Friendship Train." This is not accidental. Because for several years, good neighborly relations have been maintained between the Soviet Union and Finland. A few days ago, Finnish Prime Minister Fagerholm paid a friendly visit to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet-Finnish communique issued after talks with Soviet government leaders marked a new development in friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. The communique pointed out that the talks further deepened mutual understanding between the two countries, once again demonstrated the spirit of mutual respect and trust between the two countries, and emphasized the need to continue to firmly maintain good relations between the two countries.
    The facts of the past few years have proved that maintaining such good neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland is not only in the vital interests of both countries, but also helps to consolidate international peace, especially the security of the Nordic region. As everyone knows, since Finland and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance in 1948, international imperialist forces have been trying to provoke relations between the two countries, attempting to drag Finland into the aggressive military bloc of Western countries, undermine Finland's independence, and establish anti-Soviet bases near the heartland of the Soviet Union. The friendly and cooperative relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland is a good example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The Soviet-Finnish communique once again affirmed the peaceful coexistence relationship between the two countries and the great significance of this relationship, and emphasized that no external events should be allowed to affect this relationship. This is a powerful blow to imperialist provocateurs.
    The Soviet-Finnish communique emphasized the willingness of the two governments to work to promote good-neighborly relations between the Nordic countries. Developing friendly relations between the Nordic countries is obviously greatly beneficial to the peace and security of these countries and the whole of Europe. Since friendly and mutually beneficial good-neighborly relations can be established between the Soviet Union and Finland, two countries with different social systems, why can't other Nordic countries neighboring the Soviet Union establish equally friendly relations with the Soviet Union? As Finnish Prime Minister Fagerholm pointed out in an interview with a Moscow correspondent of Stockholm's "New Daily": If the existing good relations between the Soviet Union and Finland can be extended to other Nordic countries, this will not only benefit these countries, but will also be of great significance to the peace and security of the Baltic Sea.
    The communique specifically mentioned the issue of disarmament, pointing out the importance of achieving practical results in disarmament, especially in the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons under appropriate international control. The United States and other Western countries pay lip service to agreeing to disarmament, but in fact they are not only continuing to obstruct the reaching of international agreements on disarmament, but are also further expanding their armaments and accelerating preparations for atomic warfare. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to point out in the communique that practical results should be achieved in solving the issue of disarmament.
    According to the communique, shortly after the Finnish Prime Minister's friendly visit, Bulganin and Khrushchev will be invited to visit Finland this spring. Such mutual friendly visits and direct talks between the national leaders of the two countries have proved and will continue to prove to be of great help to the further consolidation and development of friendly relations between the two countries. Peace-loving people will be happy to see the continued strengthening of the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.

### 和平共处的范例

    和平共处的范例
    人们曾经把往返在莫斯科和赫尔辛基之间的列车叫做“和平友谊列车”。这不是偶然的。因为几年来在苏联和芬兰之间一直维持着睦邻关系。几天前芬兰总理法格霍姆到苏联进行友好访问，并在同苏联政府领导人进行会谈以后发表的苏联—芬兰公报，标志着苏芬两国友好合作关系的新发展。公报指出会谈进一步加深了两国的相互谅解，再一次显示了两国互相尊重和信任的精神，并强调要继续坚定地维持两国间的良好关系。
    几年来的事实证明，苏芬两国维持这种良好的睦邻关系，既符合两国的切身利益，也有助于巩固国际和平特别是北欧地区的安全。大家知道，自从芬兰同苏联在1948年签订了友好合作互助条约以来，国际帝国主义势力一直设法挑拨两国的关系，企图把芬兰卷进西方国家的侵略军事集团，破坏芬兰的独立，并在靠近苏联的心脏地区建立反苏基地。苏芬两国的友好合作关系，是不同社会制度国家和平共处的良好范例。这次苏联—芬兰公报再一次肯定了两国之间的和平共处关系和这种关系的重大意义，并且强调不容许任何外部事件影响到这种关系。这是对帝国主义挑拨者的一个有力的打击。
    苏—芬公报强调了两国政府愿意为促进北欧国家的睦邻关系而努力。发展北欧各国之间的友好关系，显然大大有利于这些国家和整个欧洲的和平和安全。在苏联和芬兰两个社会制度不同的国家之间既然能够建立友好和互利的睦邻关系；那末，同样是邻近苏联的其它北欧国家为什么不能够同苏联建立同样友好的关系呢？这正如芬兰总理法格霍姆在对斯德哥尔摩“新日报”驻莫斯科记者发表的谈话中指出的：如果苏芬两国现存的良好关系能够推及到其它北欧国家，这不但有利于这些国家，并且对波罗的海的和平和安全也有重大的意义。
    两国公报特别提到裁军的问题，指出在裁军特别是在适当国际管制下禁止原子武器和氢武器方面获得实际结果的重要意义。美国和其它西方国家空谈同意裁军，但实际上不但正继续阻挠就裁军问题达成国际协议，而且还在进一步扩充军备，加速准备原子战争。因此，公报中指出应当在解决裁军的问题上取得实际的结果是十分必要的。
    据两国公报宣布，在芬兰总理这次友好访问之后不久，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫将应邀于今春访问芬兰。两国国家领导人的这种相互的友好访问和直接会谈，已经证明并将继续证明大大有助于两国友好关系的进一步巩固和发展。爱好和平的人都会愿意看到苏联同芬兰之间建立在和平共处原则基础上的友好关系的继续增强。
