    Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 24th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the West Irian question on the 23rd.

    Indonesian representative Soegardo spoke first, accusing the Netherlands of exercising colonial control over West Irian. He said: The Indonesian government and people will never condone Dutch rule over West Irian. "The Indonesian government and people will never rest until this injustice is rectified in a way that conforms to the universally recognized freedom and independence of the Indonesian people."

    Soegardo said that Indonesia believes that West Irian is an indivisible part of its territory. The island should have been returned to Indonesia when Indonesia became independent.

    Soegardo said: All the typical characteristics of colonial rule and oppression can currently be found in West Irian. There is no political freedom there; inequality and discrimination exist between the local residents and the Dutch; the Dutch authorities implement a divide-and-rule policy; there is no real progress in education, health, and public welfare; prisons and concentration camps are overcrowded with political prisoners or so-called "terrorists"; repressive measures are implemented; disturbances occur everywhere, some of which have taken place recently, in which people have been shot; and other things of this nature.

    India, Burma, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yugoslavia, and Bolivia, along with ten other countries, jointly submitted a proposal at the meeting, suggesting that the President of the United Nations General Assembly appoint a conciliation committee composed of three members to assist the governments of Indonesia and the Netherlands in conducting negotiations in order to seek a just and peaceful resolution of the problem in accordance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.

    Dutch representative Schurmann rejected the thirteen-nation proposal. He said that as long as Indonesia still considers West Irian an indivisible part of its territory, the Netherlands cannot hold negotiations with it. Schurmann insisted that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the West Irian issue.

    Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 24th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Cyprus question on the 22nd. The committee adopted a proposal put forward by Indian representative Menon by a vote of seventy-six to zero (Afghanistan and Panama abstained, Hungary and the Federation of South Africa were absent). The proposal "expresses the sincere hope that a peaceful, democratic and just solution (to the Cyprus question) can be found in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, and hopes that negotiations will be resumed and continued for this purpose." The other four proposals that were successively put forward during the discussion were not put to a vote because the proposers did not insist on a vote.

    Indian representative Menon spoke before the vote, believing that after gaining independence, Cyprus should maintain its territorial integrity and not be annexed to any country. Soviet representative Tsarapkin pointed out that the Indian proposal has shortcomings because it only expresses the hope that negotiations on the Cyprus issue will continue; however, the Soviet delegation supports this proposal because it keeps the door open for negotiations and keeps the Cyprus issue within the purview of the United Nations. He said that the Soviet delegation understands the Indian proposal to mean that representatives of the Cypriot people will participate in the prescribed negotiations.

    联大政委会开始讨论西伊里安问题
    印度尼西亚代表要求归还西伊里安
    塞浦路斯问题辩论结束并通过印度提案
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会23日开始讨论西伊里安问题。
    印度尼西亚代表苏加沃首先发言，指责荷兰对西伊里安实行殖民主义的控制。他说：印度尼西亚政府和人民决不默许荷兰对西伊里安的统治，“除非以符合印度尼西亚人民的公认的自由和独立的方式纠正这种不公正现象，否则印度尼西亚政府和人民决不罢休”。
    苏加沃说，印度尼西亚认为，西伊里安是它的领土的不可分割的一部分。这个岛屿原应该在印度尼西亚独立的时候归还印度尼西亚。
    苏加沃说：殖民主义统治和压迫的一切典型特点目前在西伊里安都可以找到。在那里没有政治自由；当地居民和荷兰人之间存在着不平等现象，实行着歧视；荷兰当局实行分而治之的政策；在教育、卫生、公共福利方面没有真正的进步；监狱和集中营里政治犯或者所谓“恐怖分子”人满为患；实行镇压措施；各处发生骚动，有些就发生在最近，在这些骚动中有人被枪杀；以及其他诸如此类的事情。
    印度、缅甸、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、南斯拉夫和玻利维亚等十三个国家在会上提出一个提案，建议联合国大会主席任命一个由三个委员组成的斡旋委员会，协助印度尼西亚和荷兰两国政府进行谈判，以便根据联合国宪章的原则和目的求得这个问题的公正而和平的解决。
    荷兰代表舒尔曼对十三国提案表示拒绝。他说，只要印度尼西亚仍然认为西伊里安是它的版图的不可分割的一部分，荷兰便不可能同它举行谈判。舒尔曼硬说联合国无权过问西伊里安问题。
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会22日结束关于塞浦路斯问题的讨论。委员会以七十六票对零票（阿富汗、巴拿马弃权，匈牙利、南非联邦缺席）通过了印度代表梅农提出的一项提案，提案“表示真诚希望根据联合国宪章的原则，找到一个和平、民主和公正的解决（塞浦路斯问题的）办法，同时希望为了达到这个目的而恢复和继续谈判”。在讨论过程中先后提出的其他四个提案由于提案人并不坚持要求进行表决而没有付表决。
    印度代表梅农在表决前发言，认为塞浦路斯在获得独立后，应保持其领土完整而不归附任何一国。苏联代表查拉普金指出，印度的提案是有缺点的，因为它只是表示希望就塞浦路斯问题继续进行谈判；但是，苏联代表团支持这个提案，因为这个提案使谈判的大门继续敞开，并且使塞浦路斯问题保持在联合国的视野内。他说，苏联代表团是这样理解印度的提案的：在规定的谈判中将有塞浦路斯人民代表参加。
