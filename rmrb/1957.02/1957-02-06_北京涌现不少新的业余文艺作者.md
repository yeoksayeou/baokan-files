Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The results of the employee amateur literary creation contest, announced in the January issue of "Beijing Literature," show that many new amateur creators are emerging in Beijing. The contest received over 400 amateur works from employees.

A total of nineteen entries won prizes in the contest. These included novels, essays, poems, ballads, and fine arts. "The Seedling Raiser," written by Liang Hanbing of the Ministry of Railways, is a good, concise novel. The poem "Moving Music" by Wen Chengxun, a young lathe operator at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, and the poem "Foundry Worker" by Han Yiping, a young milling worker at the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, were also outstanding works in this contest. "Foundry Worker" expresses the author's profound understanding of labor in socialist construction and is filled with beautiful aspirations for the future of the motherland.

The contest was jointly organized by the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles and three other units. These units have done a lot of work in cultivating young amateur creators. Last August, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, in collaboration with the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, held "Literary Lectures" for young amateur creators, and has given five reports from the beginning until now. Chen Qitong spoke about his creative process in writing "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains"; Lao She talked about issues related to literary language. These reports were welcomed by young amateur creators. They also hold some small-scale report meetings from time to time. These units organize the young people into various groups, maintaining regular contact and providing assistance. In addition, there are dedicated counselors.

    北京涌现不少新的业余文艺作者
    据新华社讯　从“北京文艺”1月号揭晓的职工业余文艺创作征文评选结果，可以看出北京市有不少新的业余创作者显露头角。这次征文共收到四百多件职工的业余作品。
    征文得奖作品共十九篇。其中有小说、散文、诗歌、曲艺、美术等。铁道部梁寒冰所写的“育苗人”是一篇好的小说，短小精练。北京第一机床厂青年车床工温承训的诗“动人的音乐”和国营北京第一棉纺织厂青年铣工韩忆萍的诗“铸工”也是这次征文中的优秀作品。“铸工”表现了作者在社会主义建设中对劳动有深刻的体会，对祖国的未来充满了美好的憧憬。
    这次征文是由北京市文学艺术工作者联合会等四个单位联合举办的。这些单位曾经在培养青年业余创作方面作了许多工作。去年8月，北京市文学艺术工作者联合会协同北京市工会联合会、青年团北京市委员会为业余青年创作者举办了“文学讲座”，从开始以来到现在已作了五个报告。陈其通谈了自己创作“万水千山”的经过；老舍讲了有关文学语言的问题。这些报告都受到青年业余创作者的欢迎。他们还随时举办一些小型报告会。这些单位把青年们组织成各种小组，经常地联系和帮助。另外，还设有专门的辅导员。
