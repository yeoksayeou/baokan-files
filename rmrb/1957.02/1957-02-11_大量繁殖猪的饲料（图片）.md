    Feed for Mass Pig Breeding
    Last year, the Hengyu Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Fuzhou used water hyacinth to feed pigs, with very good results. The cooperative is now using rice straw to build sheds to protect the water hyacinth over the winter; it is estimated that by April this year, 100,000 jin of water hyacinth seeds will be available to supply various regions for propagation.
    The Huochetou Agricultural Cooperative in Shaxian County, Fujian Province, has been experimenting with fermented rice straw mixed with other feed to feed pigs since the year before last. More than a year of experience has proven that this feed can promote pig development. Last year, a batch of pigs sold were only raised for seven months each, with an average daily weight gain of over ten liang, and the highest reaching more than thirteen liang.

    大量繁殖猪的饲料
    福州市郊横屿农业社去年利用水浮莲喂猪，效果很好。这个社现在正用稻草盖棚，保护水浮莲过冬；预计到今年4月可有十万斤水浮莲种子供应各地繁殖。
    福建省沙县火车头农业社，自前年起试用发酵稻草混合其他饲料喂猪。一年多来的经验证明，这种饲料能促进猪的发育。去年出售的一批猪，每头只饲养七个月，平均每天长肉十两以上，最多的达十三两多。
