Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) are actively finding ways to conserve electricity. According to incomplete statistics, the various organs have saved more than 10,000 yuan in electricity bills in the past two months.

The leading cadres of the PLA headquarters attach great importance to saving electricity. Many units have convened meetings of party members and Communist Youth League members, calling on them to play an exemplary role in saving electricity; some units have also held family meetings to educate them on saving electricity. After mobilization and education, many units, such as the General Office of the Ministry of National Defense, have reduced the size of the light bulbs used in offices and dormitories. Some units have adopted measures such as removing unnecessary street lights, regular power outages, and concentrated study in the evenings to save electricity. The Training and Supervision Department has also merged some offices, which has saved both housing and electricity.

    解放军总部各机关
    大力节约用电
    新华社14日讯　中国人民解放军总部各机关积极设法节约用电，据不完全统计，近两个月来，各机关节约电费一万多元。
    解放军总部各机关首长十分重视节约用电。不少单位召开了党员、团员会议，号召党、团员们在节约用电上起模范作用；有的单位还召开家属会议，进行了节约用电的教育。经过动员教育后，国防部办公厅等许多单位都把办公室和宿舍用的照明灯泡改小了。有的单位采取拆除不必要的路灯、定期停电、晚上集中学习等办法节约用电。训练总监部还合并了一些办公室，既节省了房子，也节约了用电。
