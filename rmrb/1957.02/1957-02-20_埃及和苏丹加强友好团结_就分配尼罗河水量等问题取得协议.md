Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, February 19th: "Al-Ahram" reported on the 18th that during Sudanese Deputy Prime Minister Hamza's recent visit to Cairo, Egypt and Sudan reached an agreement on the main issues of the Aswan High Dam project, especially the equal distribution of Nile water.

The newspaper said that experts from both countries will soon hold meetings to discuss the details, regardless of when the project starts or who funds it.

The two countries also reached an agreement on Egypt withdrawing 20,000 pounds from its sterling balances in the United Kingdom as a guarantee for the Sudanese currency.

According to "Al-Ahram", after the Sudanese Ambassador to London recently consulted with the British Foreign Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer, the United Kingdom has agreed to implement this approach. Egypt's sterling balances in the United Kingdom have been frozen since Egypt regained control of the Suez Canal.

    新华社开罗19日电　“金字塔报”18日报道，在苏丹副总理哈姆札最近访问开罗期间，埃及同苏丹就阿斯旺高水坝工程的主要问题、特别是平均分配尼罗河水量问题达成了协议。
    这家报纸说，两国的专家们不久将举行会议来讨论细节问题，不管工程在什么时候动工或者谁来资助这项工程。
    两国还就埃及从它在英国的英镑结余中拿出两万英镑来作为苏丹货币的保证金问题达成了协议。
    据“金字塔报”说，最近苏丹驻伦敦大使同英国外交大臣和财政大臣协商后，英国已经同意实施这样的办法。埃及在英国的英镑结余自从埃及收回苏伊士运河以后就一直在冻结中。
