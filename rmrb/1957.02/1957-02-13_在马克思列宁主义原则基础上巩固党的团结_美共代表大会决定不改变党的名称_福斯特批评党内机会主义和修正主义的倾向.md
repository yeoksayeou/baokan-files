Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 11th (TASS dispatch): The 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of the United States continues to convene. This Congress is being conducted under the slogan of consolidating the unity of the Party ranks on the basis of long-tested Marxist-Leninist principles. This was particularly evident at the morning session on February 10, which discussed the issue of the Party's name and form.

The Congress overwhelmingly adopted the "Resolution on the Name and Form" of the Party, proposed by Oleta O'Connor Yeats based on the unanimous decision of the subcommittee of the resolution draft committee, calling for the strengthening of the unity of the Communist Party of the United States and opposing the proposition to transform the Party into a political association or educational association. The resolution reads as follows:

"1. The Congress affirms that the Communist Party of the United States continues to exist. Our main purpose is to consolidate, reorganize, and strengthen the Communist Party and to eliminate the Party's isolation.

2. The Congress opposes turning the Party into a political association or an educational association.

3. While we oppose endless debate on this issue, this should not prevent any effective research and discussion of the issue that may be organized by the new National Committee.

4. We recognize that some views expressed during this discussion have revisionist overtones, but it is incorrect to dismiss all suggestions for changing the name and form as essentially revisionist."

The question of the Party's name and form was one of the most sharply debated issues within the Party before the opening of the Congress. Some people advocated changing the Party into a vaguely defined group for the purpose of enlightenment, which meant, in effect, advocating the abolition of the Communist Party of the United States as a political party.

The resolution passed by the Congress was proposed by the resolution draft subcommittee based on the recommendations of delegations from eleven states. These state delegations included those from states such as New York, California, Michigan, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Those who voted in favor of this resolution included William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Party, and John Gates, editor-in-chief of the "Daily Worker." Only three delegates voted against the proposal. One of these three delegates said that he voted against the proposal because it did not condemn the idea of abolishing the Communist Party intensely enough, and did not rule out the possibility of resuming discussion of this issue, which he considered harmful.

According to the Credentials Committee of the Congress, the national congress was attended by three hundred delegates representing organizations from thirty-four states in the United States, forty-five of whom had suffered persecution by the U.S. government under the notorious Smith Act.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 10th (TASS dispatch): Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, and William Z. Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, spoke at the afternoon session of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of the United States on February 9th.

Dennis called on the Party to unite on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles.

Dennis pointed out that after the exposure of the personality cult and the events in Hungary, "a considerable number of people within the Party temporarily lost their bearings, became disoriented, and were followed by intense intra-party struggles," which posed a risk of division to the Party. Dennis pointed out, however, that "fortunately, a considerable number of Party members and some leaders were able to distinguish right from wrong," and that while "struggling to save the Party, protect the Party's Marxist-Leninist principles, and strive for necessary changes, they resolutely worked to maintain the Party's unity."

Dennis said that many of the divisions within the Party had not yet been resolved, and might not be resolved at the Congress. He said, however, that the Party was now able to "adopt a collective and consistent attitude on many programmatic issues and most of the urgent issues that must be addressed."

Dennis said that while the tendency to mechanically apply the experiences of other Marxist parties must be eradicated, it must also be said that there are "universally applicable Marxist principles." He also said, "We condemn the attitude of negating and being hostile to socialist countries and their Marxist parties. We oppose seeing only the violations of socialist principles and failing to see the historical achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, and failing to see the self-correction and rapid progress of these new socialist systems."

In his speech, Foster criticized opportunistic and revisionist tendencies within the Party. He called on the Congress to reject any suggestion of replacing the Communist Party with a "political association," saying, "Due to the belligerence of American imperialism, making such a decision would be a backward and suicidal step for us." Foster said that the Communist Party should also clearly reaffirm that it upholds the principles of Marxism-Leninism and opposes the revisionists' attempts to portray Leninism as "essentially only" a "product of the Russian revolution with a limited scope of application." Foster said that the Communist Party must also strengthen its leadership, especially in the National Committee, and that the leading organs should absorb more proletarian elements and new forces.

Foster emphasized that "strengthening proletarian internationalist solidarity is the most important task of this Congress."

Foster concluded by saying: "Our Congress, as long as it creates a situation in which the entire Party unites around a healthy, Marxist-Leninist program and leadership structure, will be able to overcome the crisis. ... If we can recognize the importance of our Party's tasks based on the lessons we have learned from the long and beneficial intra-party discussions, we will improve our Party's legal standing at an astonishing rate, consolidate our ranks ... and once again become a practical factor in the struggles of the developing working class, Black people, and all democratic forces in our country."

    在马克思列宁主义原则基础上巩固党的团结
    美共代表大会决定不改变党的名称
    福斯特批评党内机会主义和修正主义的倾向
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约11日讯：美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会继续举行会议。这次代表大会是在久经考验的马克思列宁主义原则的基础上巩固党的队伍的团结的口号下进行的。在2月10日的上午会议上特别表现出了这一点。这次会议讨论了党的名称和形式的问题。
    代表大会以绝大多数通过了奥勒塔·奥康纳—叶芝根据决议草案委员会小组委员会的一致决定所提出的关于党的“名称和形式的决议”，号召加强美国共产党的团结，反对把党改变成为一个政治协会或者教育协会的主张。决议内容如下：
    “一、代表大会确定美国共产党继续存在。我们的主要目的是巩固、改组和加强共产党，并且消除党的孤立状态。
    二、代表大会反对把党变成政治协会或者教育协会。
    三、虽然我们反对无休止地争论这个问题，但是这不应当妨碍对问题进行可能由新的全国委员会组织的任何有效的研究和讨论。
    四、我们承认，在这次讨论过程中，有些观点带有修正主义色彩，但是，如果把一切改变名称和形式的建议，都斥为实质上的修正主义，这是不正确的。”
    关于党的名称和形式的问题是代表大会开幕前党内争论最尖锐的一个问题，某些人主张把党改变成为某种不定形式的、以启蒙为目的的团体，这就是说实际上主张取消美国共产党这样一个政党。
    大会通过的决议是决议草案小组委员会根据十一个州的代表团的建议而提出的。这些州的代表团中包括像纽约、加利福尼亚、密执安、伊利诺斯、宾夕法尼亚这样一些州的代表团。投票赞成这项决议的有美国共产党主席福斯特、党总书记丹尼斯和“工人日报”总编辑盖兹。投票反对这个提案的只有三个代表。这三个代表中有一个代表说，他投票反对这个提案是因为这个提案谴责那种要取消共产党的主张还不够激烈，并且没有排斥恢复对这个问题的讨论的可能性，而他认为恢复这种讨论是有害的。
    另据大会资格审查委员会说，出席这次全国代表大会的有美国三十四个州组织的三百名代表，他们当中有四十五名代表曾经遭受过美国政府根据臭名昭彰的史密斯法所施加的迫害。
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：美国共产党总书记尤金·丹尼斯和美国共产党主席威廉·福斯特在美国共产党第十六次全国代表大会9日下午会议上讲了话。
    丹尼斯号召党在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上团结起来。
    丹尼斯指出，在个人崇拜被揭露和匈牙利事件发生之后，“党内有相当一部分人一时迷失方向，涣散了下来，跟着发生了剧烈的党内斗争”，这使党有分裂的危险。丹尼斯指出，但是，值得庆幸的是，“我们党内有相当一部分党员和一些领导人能够明辨是非”，在为“挽救党、保护党的马克思列宁主义原则和争取必要的改变而斗争的同时，坚决努力维护党的团结”。
    丹尼斯说，党内的许多分歧还未解决，在代表大会上可能仍旧得不到解决。他说，但是党现在已经能够“对许多纲领性的问题和大多数必须加以解决的紧要问题采取集体的一致态度”。
    丹尼斯说，机械地搬用其他马克思主义政党的经验的倾向固然必须加以根除，但是也必须说，“放之四海而皆准的马克思主义原则”是有的。他还说，“我们谴责那种否定和敌视社会主义国家及其马克思主义政党的态度。我们反对只看到社会主义原则遭到破坏而不看到苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的历史成就，不看到现在这些新的社会主义制度的自我纠正和飞速进展的过程。”
    福斯特在演说中批评了党内的机会主义和修正主义的倾向。他号召代表大会拒绝任何关于以“政治协会”代替共产党的建议，他说，“由于美国帝国主义的好战，作出这种决定对我们将是倒退的、招致灭亡的一步”。福斯特说，共产党还应当明确地重申：它维护马克思列宁主义的原则，反对修正主义者企图把列宁主义描写为“实质上仅是”一个“运用范围有限的俄国革命的产品”。福斯特说，共产党还必须加强自己的领导，尤其是在全国委员会中，领导机关要吸取更多的无产阶级分子和新生力量。
    福斯特强调指出，“加强无产阶级国际主义团结是这次代表大会的最重大的任务。”
    福斯特最后说：“我们的代表大会，只要形成全党团结在健康的、马克思列宁主义的纲领和领导机构的周围的局面，它便能够克服危机。……如果我们能够根据我们从长期的和有益的党内讨论中所得到的经验教训来认识我党的任务的重要性，我们就会以惊人的速度改善我党的法律地位、巩固自己的队伍……和重新成为正在发展着的工人阶级、黑人和我国一切民主力量的斗争中的实际因素。”
