    Improve Business Management to Adapt to Market Conditions
	Chi Juncheng

    Since the opening of free markets in various places, some shortcomings in the business management of many state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives have become more apparent. These shortcomings are mainly reflected in two aspects:

    One is excessive business links. At present, inter-provincial adjusted commodities generally have to go through five to six links; inter-county adjustments within a province have at least four links; even local products sold locally within a district have to go through three to five links. For example, reed mats from Shandong and Hebei provinces have to go through six to seven links to reach consumers in Liaoning Province. Huang pears from Teng County, Shandong Province, have a purchase price of only six cents per catty at the place of origin, but the wholesale price reaches twenty-four cents per catty when transported to Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, which is four times the purchase price at the place of origin. If transportation and miscellaneous expenses, packaging costs, and losses are deducted, the operators' profit still reaches more than two times. Oranges from Shunde County, Guangdong Province, are transported and sold to Guangzhou City through six links, and the cost and profit increase by 11.88 yuan per hundred catties, with a purchase and sales price difference of 169%. Similar things happen everywhere.

    The second is that expenses are budgeted loosely and profits are unreasonable. In some areas, commercial departments calculate commodity expenses without starting from reality, preferring to overestimate rather than underestimate; packaging supplies such as baskets, hampers, and sacks that could be used several times are all included in the cost of the commodity at the market retail price once. This inevitably increases the cost of the commodity. The Jinan Dried and Fresh Fruit Wholesale Station of the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative calculates the cost of apples purchased from the suburbs of Jinan according to the cost of Yantai apples transported from hundreds of miles away, adding expenses and profit of 43.56%, while the actual cost is only 20.7%, and the net profit reaches as much as 22%, which is obviously extremely unreasonable.

    The poor management of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, excessive business links, and excessive expenses inevitably lead to the suppression of purchase prices at the place of origin and the expansion of regional price differences. This frustrates farmers' enthusiasm for production and creates conditions for short-distance trafficking to be profitable, allowing some vendors to obtain exorbitant profits. Some farmers abandon agriculture for commerce because commercial income is greater than agricultural income, and agricultural cooperatives and farmers are unwilling to implement the sales contracts signed with the supply and marketing cooperatives. If the state cannot control the source of goods, it will not be able to lead the free market through supply and marketing operations. For example, the reed mats produced in Huantai, Shandong, could have been directly allocated between grassroots cooperatives within the supply and marketing cooperative system to meet the needs of neighboring counties, but the method of grassroots cooperative purchasing on behalf of others, provincial and county-level operations, county-level cooperative wholesale at the sales location, and grassroots cooperative retail is still adopted. Therefore, it takes five links for the reed mats to go from the producer to the consumer. As a result, the purchase and sales price difference for reed mats transferred from Huantai to Zouping County, which is 40 miles away, reaches 70.13%. Because the regional price difference is too large and trafficking is profitable, more than 50 people in Lupu Village, Huantai Sixth District, purchase each reed mat at 30 to 40 cents higher than the purchase price and sell it to neighboring counties such as Zouping and Qidong for about one yuan lower than the sales price, making a profit of more than 400 yuan at a time. The masses are very dissatisfied with the supply and marketing cooperatives.

    The shortcomings exposed in the business management of commercial departments show that some business units still have a certain degree of capitalist business thinking in their operations. They consider the interests of producers and consumers less and consider their own losses and profits more; they do not study the natural circulation law of commodities, and they do whatever makes money, thus causing departments and levels to compete for business and profits. In the distribution of profits, they take more for themselves and leave less for lower levels, frustrating the business enthusiasm of grassroots units. For example, the Wanli Grassroots Cooperative in Changqing County, Shandong Province, loses 12.4 cents for every 100 catties of shoe soles it purchases, while the county cooperative's profit is as high as 50% or more. The staff of the grassroots cooperative said: "The more we purchase, the more money we lose." The Zhangjiakou Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province does not get involved in the operation of many commodities itself, but only adds a 1.5% management fee and a 2% net profit for simply transferring accounts. This practice has caused dissatisfaction among county cooperatives, especially grassroots cooperatives. An overly bloated commercial organization and an excessive number of personnel are also one of the main reasons for the multiple business links and large purchase and sales price differences. According to an actual survey in the Zhizong District of Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, there are a total of ten wholesale institutions, sixty-four retail outlets, and 520 commercial personnel in the entire district. These include nine wholesale departments and two grain supply points of seven state-owned commercial enterprises engaged in grain, oil, monopoly, trade, department stores, food, and knitwear, with 76 cadres; the supply and marketing cooperative has one non-staple food wholesale department, nine specialized stores, and ten distribution stores, with 129 cadres; and public-private joint ventures, cooperative groups, handicraft cooperatives (groups), and small businesses and vendors have a total of 42 retail outlets with 324 employees. The work efficiency of these people is very low. According to statistics, each commercial person serves an average of only 70 customers (in proportion to the district's population). Judging from the operating turnover in the second and third quarters of 1956, the average monthly retail sales per person in the supply and marketing cooperative was 833 yuan, of which the average for the ten distribution stores was only 450 yuan per person, and the lowest was only 260 yuan. Although the six state-owned companies are all engaged in wholesale and procurement business, the average monthly sales per person is only a little over 1,100 yuan. Some companies and distribution stores of supply and marketing cooperatives do not earn enough to cover their wage expenses due to the large number of personnel and small business volume. In order to make up for the insufficient expenses, these institutions increase some unnecessary business links to find something to do, which increases commodity circulation costs and makes the purchase price and sales price widely different.

    The shortcomings existing in the business management of socialist commercial departments must be overcome with effective measures. According to preliminary experience in various places, an important measure to improve business management is to actively organize farmer trade. For local products sold locally, farmer trade should be organized for adjustment as soon as possible, and the business enthusiasm of grassroots units should be brought into play. Local products sold locally generally have the characteristics of being small in quantity and scattered. It is difficult for state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives to operate these products. Moreover, if they intervene in the operation of these products, they will raise the sales price or lower the purchase price, which is detrimental to producers, consumers, and operators. We must lead farmer trade by restoring or rectifying farmer trade markets and establishing exchanges, farmer service stations, and agency houses to serve farmer trade. This will not only further invigorate the rural market, but also promote the continuous improvement of the business management of state-owned and cooperative commerce. In the division of labor between higher and lower levels, the enthusiasm of lower-level institutions should be brought into play, and grassroots units should be supported as much as possible in operating commodities that they can operate. The adjustment of commodities between districts within a county and between neighboring counties should also allow grassroots units (including supply and marketing cooperatives, joint venture stores, cooperative groups, handicraftsmen, and small businesses and vendors) to directly link up with the place of origin for purchase and sales under the principle of conforming to the direction of commodity circulation. County-level departments should not intervene in the operation, which is beneficial to all parties. The purchase price of soil nitrate produced in Oumiao District, Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, has increased by 1.3 yuan per dan and the sales price has decreased by 1.2 yuan per dan since the grassroots supply and marketing cooperative took over the operation, and the grassroots cooperative has turned from losing money to making money. In Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, the cost was reduced and the purchase and sales price difference was reduced after the local products sold locally were delegated to the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives for self-operation. For example, when the county cooperative operated the local paper produced in a district and entrusted the grassroots cooperative to purchase it on its behalf, the purchase and sales price difference reached 52.5%, which was reduced to 24.2% after the delegation, and the retail price was reduced by about 18%. However, for some commodities that are difficult for grassroots units to operate, county-level state-owned and cooperative commerce should actively carry out regional adjustment or seasonal reserves in accordance with the commodity division of labor. Under the leadership of the local Party and government, they should delineate the scope of operation roughly according to the actual situation and in accordance with local conditions to avoid unnecessary losses caused by blindly running around. Finally, the existing commercial institutions and personnel should be comprehensively inspected under the unified leadership of the local Party and government departments according to the principle of both facilitating mass purchase and sales and conforming to economic accounting, and some unnecessary departments or institutions should be abolished or merged in accordance with the principle of streamlining and saving.

    适应市场情况改善经营管理	迟俊成
    各地开放自由市场以来，许多国营商店和供销合作社经营管理上的某些缺点暴露得更加明显了，这些缺点主要表现在两个方面：
    一个是经营环节过多。目前省际调剂的商品，一般要经过五个到六个环节；省内县和县之间调剂，至少是四个环节；就是在一个区范围内当地生产当地销售的商品，也要经过三个到五个环节。例如：山东和河北省的苇席，运到辽宁省的消费者手里，要经过六至七道环节。山东省滕县的黄梨，产地收购价每斤只六分，运到南京、上海等地每斤批发价即达二角四，等于产地收购价的四倍，如扣除运杂费，包装费和损耗，经营者的利润仍达二倍以上。广东省顺德县的桔柑，运销广州市经过六个环节，每百斤增加费用和利润十一元八角八分，购销差价达169％。类似的事各地都有。
    其次是费用宽打窄用，利润不合理。有些地区的商业部门计算商品费用不从实际出发，宁多勿少；把本来可以用几次的筐、篓、麻袋等包装用品都按市场零售价一次计入商品的成本之内。这就必然要加大商品的成本。山东省供销社济南干鲜果批发站，收购济南近郊的苹果，也按远从数百里运来的烟台苹果计算费用，共加费用和利润43.56％，而实际费用只20.7％，纯利达22％之多，显然极不合理。
    国营商业和供销社的经营管理不善，经营环节过多，费用过大，就必然要压低产地收购价和扩大地区差价，这就挫折了农民的生产积极性，同时造成短途贩运有利可图的条件，使部分商贩获得暴利，有些农民因商业收入大于农业，就弃农经商，农业社和农民也不肯执行与供销社签订的推销合同了。国家掌握不了货源，就无法通过供销业务来领导自由市场。如山东桓台生产的苇席，各邻县所需要的部分本来可以通过供销社内部组织基层社之间直接调拨，但也要采取基层社代购，省、县两级经营，销地的县社批发，基层社零售的办法。因此，苇席从生产者到消费者手里，就需要经过五道环节。这样，从桓台调到距离四十里的邹平县，购销差价即达70.13％。因地区差价过大，贩运有利，仅桓台六区吕埠一个村就有五十多人推着小车以每领席子高于收购牌价三至四角收购后，运到邻近的邹平、齐东等县低于销售牌价一元左右出售，一次即获利四百多元。群众对供销社很不满意。
    商业部门在经营管理上暴露出来的缺点，说明某些经营单位在业务上还存在着一定程度的资本主义经营思想。他们对生产者和消费者的利益考虑的少了些，对本身的赔钱和赚钱考虑的多了些；不研究商品的自然流转规律，什么赚钱干什么，因而部门之间和上下级之间争业务、争利润。在利润分配上自己多、下级少，挫折了基层单位的经营积极性。如山东省长清县万里基层社，收购一百斤鞋底要赔一角二分四，而县社的利润却高达50％以上，基层社的工作人员说：“收购越多，赔钱越多。”河北省张家口专区供销社，有不少商品自己不插手经营，只转转账就要加经营管理费1.5％，纯益2％，这种做法引起县社特别是基层社的不满。商业机构过于臃肿，人员过多，也是经营环节多、购销差价大的主要原因之一。根据广东省阳江县织篢区的实际调查，全区共有十个批发机构，六十四个零售门市部，五百二十名商业人员。其中包括国营粮食、油脂、专卖、贸易、百货、食品、针织品七个国营商业的九个批发部和两个粮食供应点，七十六名干部；供销社有一个副食品批发部，九个专业门市部和十个分销店，一百二十九名干部；公私合营、合作小组、手工业社（组）和小商小贩共有四十二个零售门市部，三百二十四名从业人员。这些人的工作效率是很低的，据统计每个商业人员平均只服务七十个顾客（和全区人口的比例），从1956年第二、三季度的经营额来看，供销合作社每人每月平均零售额为八百三十三元，其中十个分销店每人平均只卖四百五十元，最低的仅二百六十元，六个国营公司虽然都是整宗的批发和采购业务，但每人每月的平均卖钱额也只不过一千一百多元。有些公司和供销社的分销店，由于人员多，业务小，所获得的差价还不够工薪开支。为了弥补开支不足，这些机构为了找事干，就增加了一些不必要的经营环节，加大了商品流转费用，使收购价格和销售价格相差悬殊。
    社会主义商业部门在经营管理上存在的缺点是必须采取有效措施加以克服的。根据各地初步经验，改善经营管理的一个重要措施是积极组织农民贸易，对地产地销的商品，应尽先组织农民贸易进行调剂，同时要发挥基层单位的经营积极性。地产地销的商品，一般具有数量零星、分散的特点，国营商业和供销社经营是有一定困难的。而且，对这类商品如果插手经营，就会提高销售价或降低收购价，对生产者、消费者、经营者都是不利的。要通过恢复或整顿农民贸易市场，建立为农民贸易服务的交易所、农民服务所、代理行栈等办法，来领导农民贸易。这样不但可以进一步活跃农村市场，而且也能促使国营和合作社商业不断改善经营管理。在上下级的分工上，应发挥下级机构的积极性，对基层单位能够经营的商品，尽量支持它们去经营。对县内区与区之间和邻县之间商品的调剂，在合乎商品流转方向的原则下，也应该允许基层单位（包括供销社、合营商店、合作小组、手工业者、小商小贩）直接与产地挂钩进行购销，县级各部门不宜插手经营，这样做对各方面都是有利的。湖北省襄阳县欧庙区产的土硝，自从改由基层供销社自营后，收购价每担提高一元三角，销售价降低一元二角，基层社由亏本转为赚钱。广东省阳江县把地产地销的商品下放给基层供销社自营后，降低了费用，缩小了购销差价。如一个区所产的土纸由县社经营委托基层社代购的时候，购销差价达52.5％，下放后缩小为24.2％，零售价格降低了18％左右。但是有些商品在基层单位经营有困难，县级国营和合作社商业还应该积极地按照商品分工，负责进行地区调剂或季节储备。并应在当地党政的领导下，根据实际情况，因地制宜，把经营范围大体上划一条界线，以避免因盲目乱跑而造成不应有的损失。最后，还应该根据既方便群众购销，又合乎经济核算的原则，在地方党政部门统一领导下，把现有的商业机构和人员进行一次普遍检查，本着精简节约的原则，把一些不必要的部门或机构撤销或合并。
