Strengthen Leadership over Night Shift Production
    Li Qian

    Recently, I visited some factories in the Xi'an area and found that low output, poor quality, excessive waste of raw materials, and frequent accidents are common in night shift production. Night shift workers not only don't see the factory director and engineers, but also don't see the workshop and section cadres. In some factories, the foreman leads night shift production, while in others, the group leader leads the night shift workers. The leadership of night shift production is generally neglected in all factories.

    In Northwest State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, after 6:00 PM, the factory director, all section and workshop cadres all get off work, leaving only a few shift foremen to lead the night shift production in each workshop. If problems arise between workshops, they often cause many adverse consequences because no one is responsible for solving them. For example, in the night shift production of the spinning workshop, the following has happened more than once: the humidity in the workshop is already sufficient, and the general mechanical department is requested to stop spraying, but the temperature regulation team of the general mechanical department emphasizes that their spraying task has not been completed and refuses to stop spraying. As a result, the front spinning workshop often stops due to roller lapping caused by excessive humidity. Furthermore, sometimes the power supply is insufficient at night, and the power plant needs to cut off some power, but because no one in the factory is in charge of unified allocation, the electrical department is not familiar with the situation in each workshop and cannot figure out which machines should be turned off and how many should be turned off. Sometimes too many carding machines are turned off, and the drawing, roving, and spinning processes stop because raw materials cannot be supplied. Sometimes too many roving machines are turned off, resulting in a backlog of semi-finished products produced by the carding machine, while the spinning process stops due to lack of raw materials, seriously affecting production. Because there is no unified leadership for night shift production, product quality problems cannot be resolved in a timely manner. For example, once, night shift workers in the finishing workshop discovered some coarse weft substandard cloth, which was caused by unqualified yarn spun by the front spinning and spinning workshops. At that time, the workshop director and factory leaders were not present, and the shift foreman had no way to deal with it. They had to write the problem on the handover log, and the day shift foreman reported it to the workshop director the next day, who then contacted the front spinning, spinning, and other workshops to resolve it. However, hundreds of pieces of substandard cloth had already been produced.

    The technical strength allocated to night shifts in various factories is also very weak. Generally, there are no engineers or technicians on duty, and some even have very few highly skilled technical workers. For example, the seeder workshop of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant has many types of work in night shift production, such as drilling machines, lathes, presses, punching machines, and forging. During the day, in addition to the workshop director and technical personnel leading these types of work, there are also three or four foremen who master different technologies to lead them; if mechanical failures occur, there are also six or seven grade technical workers to repair them. However, in the first half of the night shift, there is only one duty foreman who understands one or two types of technology to lead the workers. If a failure occurs on a machine that he is not familiar with, he is at a loss. To find a repairman to fix it! However, the night shift is only equipped with a third-grade repairman, and slightly larger problems cannot be repaired. Therefore, sometimes the planned products have to be stopped because mechanical and tool failures cannot be repaired. The allocation of night shift inspectors is also relatively weak. Generally, only one worker with poor technical skills inspects the products of all types of work, and it is impossible to check as carefully as during the day. Sometimes unqualified products cannot be detected. Especially after 3:30, when the duty foreman and inspector have left work, the problems encountered by workers in production are even more difficult to solve. They are unsure whether the things they produce meet the standards, and as a result, a large number of defective products are often produced. For example, in January of this year, the night shift punch press workers punched the eyes of the upper beam in the front frame of the seeder off-center. If it were during the day, the inspector would have discovered the problem with the product and reminded them to pay attention, and it could have been corrected immediately. However, neither the night shift foreman nor the inspector detected it, and more than 1,700 defective or substandard products were produced in one night shift. The phenomenon of weak night shift leadership also exists in the Sanqiao Vehicle Repair Factory. According to the branch secretary of the mechanical workshop of the factory, before November of last year, there were no foremen on duty in their workshop. The foremen often told the day shift workers about the production tasks of the night shift workers, and let them tell the night shift workers what to produce. If the night shift workers completed the task ahead of schedule or encountered problems that they could not solve themselves, they had to sit idle.

    Because factories neglect the leadership of night shift production, phenomena such as lax labor discipline and violation of operating procedures among night shift production workers continue to occur. The night shift workers in the cleaning workshop of the National Cotton Mill No. 1 do not perform as well as the day shift workers in the execution of operating procedures and cleaning work. At night, not only are black cotton, oily cotton, and cotton wool everywhere, but also, because the work surface is not clean, quality accidents such as oily cotton yarn are likely to occur. In the second half of last year, night shift workers in the cleaning workshop directly put cotton into the opening machine without removing impurities in order to save trouble. As a result, a piece of iron mixed into the cotton damaged the opening machine, and it took three or four days to repair it. Such serious violations of operating procedures have also occurred in other factories.

    There are various reasons for this problem of not paying attention to night shift production among the leaders of various factories: Some people say that it is not that we don't pay attention to night shift production, but because there are not so many cadres. In fact, cadres in these factories generally account for more than 20% of the total number of employees, and each factory has more than two or three factory directors, and each workshop has more than two workshop directors. As for engineering and technical personnel, there are more than one or two. Among so many administrative cadres and technical cadres, can't we draw out some people who can grasp the overall situation to lead night shift production?

    Some factory leaders also believe that there are fewer night shift production workers and the production value is also lower than that of the day shift, so the main strength of the leadership should be placed on the day shift. This statement is also one-sided. There are indeed fewer night shift production workers than day shift workers. Some factories account for only one-third of the total number of workers, while others account for one-quarter or one-fifth. However, due to the relaxation of leadership over them, the losses caused to the country are very large. According to preliminary statistics from the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the average number of night shift production workers in the factory last year was less than 20% of the total number of production workers, but the quality accidents and safety accidents accounted for more than 70% of the total number of accidents. Isn't this enough to illustrate the consequences of neglecting night shift leadership?

    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, various factories are mobilizing all employees to think of ways to improve output, quality, and save raw materials. However, if the leadership of night shift production is not strengthened and the various problems existing in the production of night shift workers are not resolved, the effect of increasing production and practicing economy will be affected.

### 加强对夜班生产的领导

    加强对夜班生产的领导
    李茜
    最近，我访问了西安地区的一些工厂，发现在夜班生产中普遍存在着产量低、质量差、原材料浪费多和事故多等现象。夜班生产的工人不但见不到厂长和工程师的面，连车间和科室的干部也见不到。有些工厂是由工长领导夜班生产，有些工厂是由小组长领导夜班工人。各厂对夜班生产的领导普遍是忽视的。
    西北国棉一厂一到下午六点钟以后，厂长、各科室和车间干部就全下了班，只剩下几个轮班工长分别领导各车间的夜班生产。车间与车间如果发生问题，因为没有人负责解决，经常造成很多不良后果。如前纺车间夜班生产中曾不止一次地遇到这样的事：车间的湿度已经够了，要求总机械部停止喷雾，但是总机械部的调温组却强调他们喷雾的任务还没有完成，不肯停止喷雾，结果前纺车间因为湿度过大造成皮辊缠花，经常停车。再如有时夜间电力供应不足，电厂需要停一部分电，但由于工厂没有人统一调配，电器部不熟习各车间的情况，摸不清应该关哪些机械和应该关多少，有时把梳棉机关多了，并条、粗纱、细纱等工序就因为原料供不上而停车；有时把粗纱机关多了，又造成梳棉机生产的半成品被积压，而细纱工序却因没有原料而停车，严重地影响了生产。由于夜班生产没有人统一的领导，产品质量有了问题也不能及时解决。如有一次，整理车间的夜班工人发现有一部分粗纬次布，这是由于前纺和细纱车间纺的纱不合格而造成的。当时车间主任和厂的领导人都不在，轮班工长也没有办法，只好把发现的问题写在交班簿上，第二天由白班工长反映给车间主任，再由车间主任和前纺、细纱等车间联系解决。但是，已经出了几百匹次布。
    各厂对夜班的技术力量配备也很弱，一般都没有工程师或技术员值班，有些连技术水平高的技术工人配备也很少。如西安农业机械制造厂播种机车间夜班生产的有钻床、元车、压力机、冲床、锻造等很多工种。在白天，这些工种除了有车间主任和技术人员领导外，还有三、四个掌握不同技术的工长来领导；如果机械发生故障，还有六、七级的技术工人来修理。但是，夜班工人在前半个班只有一个懂得一、两种技术的值班工长来领导，如果在他不熟习的机械上发生故障，他就束手无策。找修机工来修理吧！而夜班配备的又只是三级修机工，稍微大一点的毛病就修理不好。因此，有时因机械和工具发生故障没办法修理，就不得不把计划好的产品停下来，夜班检验工配备也是比较弱的，一般只有一个技术很差的工人检查所有各工种的产品，根本不可能像白天那样仔细的检查，有时产品不合规格也检查不出来。特别是到三点半以后，值班工长和检验工都下班了，工人生产中遇到的问题就更难解决了，自己生产的东西是否合乎规格，心中没底，结果经常造成大量的废品。如今年1月份夜班冲床工人把播种机前架中上梁的眼冲偏了。如果在白天，检验工发现产品有毛病及时提醒他们注意，马上就可以纠正了。但是，夜班工长和检验工都没有检查出来，一个夜班生产了一千七百多个废品或次品。夜班领导薄弱的现象在三桥车辆修理厂也同样存在，据该厂机械车间的支部书记谈，他们车间去年11月份以前没有工长值夜班，工长们往往把当天夜班工人的生产任务告诉白班工人，让他们转告夜班工人生产什么，而夜班工人如果提前完成任务或发生自己不能解决的问题，就只好闲在那里。
    由于各厂忽视对夜班生产的领导，夜班生产工人劳动纪律松弛和违犯操作规程的现象就不断发生。国棉一厂的清花车间夜班工人，对操作规程的执行和清洁工作都不如白天好。一到夜间，不仅黑花、油花和花毛到处都是；而且由于工作面不清洁，很容易造成油花纱等质量事故。去年后半年，清花车间的夜班工人为了省事，没有除去杂质，就直接把棉花放到开花机里，结果由于棉花里混进一块铁片，把开花机打坏了，用了三、四天的时间才修好。像这样严重违犯操作规程的现象在其他厂里也发生过。
    这种不重视夜班生产的问题，在各工厂的领导人员中间有着各种各样的理由：有些人说，并不是我们不重视夜班生产，是因为没有那么多干部。而事实上，这些厂的干部一般都占职工总数的20％以上，每个厂都有两、三个以上的厂长，每个车间都有两个以上的车间主任，至于工程技术人员更不止一、两个。在这样多的行政干部和技术干部里边，难道就不能抽出一些能掌握全面情况的人来领导夜班生产吗？
    还有一些工厂的领导人员认为，夜班生产的工人少，生产价值比白班也少，所以领导人员的主要力量应该放在白班。这种说法也是片面的，夜班生产的工人的确不如白班多，有的厂只占工人总数的三分之一，也有的占四分之一或五分之一，但是由于放松了对他们的领导，给国家造成的损失却是很大的。据西安农业机械制造厂的初步统计，该厂去年夜班生产的工人平均还不到生产工人总数的20％，而造成的质量事故和安全事故却占发生事故总数的70％以上，这难道还不足以说明忽视夜班领导所造成的后果吗？
    在增产节约运动中，各厂都在动员全体职工想办法提高产量、质量和节约原材料，但是，如果不加强夜班生产的领导，不解决夜班工人生产中存在的各种问题，增产节约的效果是会受到影响的。
