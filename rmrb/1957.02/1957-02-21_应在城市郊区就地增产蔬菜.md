    Vegetable Production Should Be Increased Locally in Suburban Areas
    Beijing has more than five months each year when vegetables cannot grow. During the winter and spring seasons, the needs of consumers are mainly guaranteed by autumn-produced Chinese cabbage, radishes, etc. In recent years, although the area for vegetable production in the suburbs has been expanding year by year, the main variety of autumn vegetables, Chinese cabbage, still cannot meet the demand and has to be imported in large quantities from Shandong and other places. This not only increases the loss of vegetables but also occupies a large number of national railway cars; operating units often lose money as a result. According to the Beijing Vegetable Company's statistics for the fourth quarter of last year, each catty of Chinese cabbage transported from Shandong lost 1.2 fen. Therefore, the most fundamental way to meet the market's vegetable supply is to increase local vegetable production.
    Is it possible to increase the production of Chinese cabbage in the suburbs of Beijing? According to our understanding in Haidian, Fengtai, and the eastern suburbs, it is entirely possible. Because in terms of income for vegetable farmers, the production of Chinese cabbage accounts for a large part of their income. At the same time, the suburbs of Beijing have a tradition of growing Chinese cabbage, and the climate is also very suitable. The Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Haidian District plans to increase the planting of 300 to 400 mu of Chinese cabbage this year, and the Si Ji Qing and Liming cooperatives also plan to increase production.
    The key to increasing Chinese cabbage production is to fully supply fertilizer. According to the experience of vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, each mu can grow about 2,200 Chinese cabbage plants, each requiring four liang of cake fertilizer, as well as topdressing fertilizer. Due to different soil types, the types of fertilizer applied also vary, so the supply departments must organize a large supply of fertilizer according to local conditions.
    Secondly, prepare for storage. Cabbage cellar storage mainly relies on the existing storage capacity of agricultural cooperatives. Currently, farmers still have difficulties in obtaining wood for digging cellars, and timber companies should solve this. Since the loss of Chinese cabbage after it enters the cellar, especially after the beginning of spring each year, is very large, the vegetable company should realistically eliminate farmers' concerns about storing cabbage in terms of seasonal price differences or storage fees, so that farmers have reasonable profits. Vegetable companies can also appropriately increase the number of cellars and organize canteens of organizations to store Chinese cabbage. In short, we must solve the storage problem in many ways and reduce the phenomenon of losing a large amount of vegetables due to improper storage and preservation.
      Some people worry: If we advocate increasing the production of Chinese cabbage in the suburbs of cities, will the sales of national Chinese cabbage production areas (such as Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces) have problems? I think that the country is vast, and the China Vegetable Company will still entrust the production area companies to order some Chinese cabbage in the future to meet the temporary needs of various places; if the whole country has a bumper harvest and does not need to be transferred in, the production area can also solve the problem by expanding sales and processing. In short, it is easier to deal with a little more autumn vegetables than less. Of course, the planned arrangement of vegetable production is also an important task and should be done well. Jian

    应在城市郊区就地增产蔬菜
    北京市每年有五个多月的时间不能生长蔬菜，冬、春两季主要依靠秋季生产的大白菜、萝卜等来保证消费者的需要。近几年，郊区蔬菜生产面积虽然逐年扩大，但是，秋菜中的主要品种——大白菜仍然不能满足需要，只得大批地从山东等地调入。这样，不但加大了蔬菜的损耗，而且占用了国家的大量车皮；经营单位经常因此赔钱。据北京市蔬菜公司去年第四季度的统计，从山东运来的大白菜每斤亏损一分二厘钱。因此，满足市场菜蔬供应的最根本的办法是增加当地的蔬菜生产。
    北京市郊区能不能增加大白菜的生产呢？就我们在海淀、丰台、东郊等地的了解，是完全可能的。因为从菜农的收入来说，生产大白菜占他们收入的很大部分，同时北京郊区有种植大白菜的习惯，气候条件也很适宜。海淀区红旗农业社准备在今年增种三、四百亩大白菜，四季青、黎明两个社也将计划增产。
    增产大白菜的关键在于充分地供应肥料，据京郊菜农的经验，每亩地可种大白菜二千二百棵左右，每棵需饼肥四两，还要追肥。由于土壤的不同，施肥品种也各有不同，因此，供应部门必须因地制宜地组织大量肥料供应。
    其次，要做好储存准备工作。窖菜储存主要依靠农业社的现有储存能力；目前菜农在挖窖的木料方面还有困难，木材公司应当加以解决。由于大白菜入窖以后，特别是每年立春后的损耗很大，因此，蔬菜公司应当实事求是从季节差价或保管费方面解除农民存菜的顾虑，使菜农有合理的利益。蔬菜公司也可以适当增加部分菜窖，以及组织机关伙食团储存大白菜。总之，要多方面解决保管问题，减少目前因储存保管不当而损失大量蔬菜的现象。
      有人顾虑：提倡城市郊区增产大白菜，那末，全国性的白菜产地（如山东、河北等省）的销路就会发生问题？我认为，全国地区辽阔，中国蔬菜公司今后仍将委托产地公司订购部分大白菜，以备调剂各地的临时需要；如果全国都丰产而不需要调入，产地也可以从扩大推销和加工方面加以解决。总之，秋菜稍多一点要比少了容易办。当然，蔬菜生产的计划安排，也是一项重要的工作，应当做好。　健
