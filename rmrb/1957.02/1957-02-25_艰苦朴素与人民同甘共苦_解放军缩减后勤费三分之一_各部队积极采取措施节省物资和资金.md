Xinhua News Agency, February 24th – A Xinhua News Agency reporter recently interviewed General Hong Xuezhi, Director of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to learn about the specific measures taken by the Chinese People's Liberation Army to "build the army through diligence and thrift."

General Hong Xuezhi told the reporter: Practicing strict economy and preventing waste is an important task for the army's logistics work this year. In accordance with the state's policy of reducing military and administrative expenses and strengthening economic construction, this year's military logistics budget has been reduced by nearly one-third compared to last year. All of our army's logistics personnel fully support this decision. As long as we mobilize all commanders and fighters to actively come up with ideas and tap potential in all aspects, we can absolutely get things done with less money. The army's logistics departments at all levels, in the spirit of "building the army through diligence and thrift," are taking a series of measures that can both save expenses and ensure necessary supplies.

General Hong Xuezhi said that the potential for savings in the army's logistics department is very large. The single item of issuing new and collecting old bedding alone can save the country a great deal of wealth. Last year, the old bedding collected was reused in military production, saving 9.1 million yuan. In addition, 746,000 pieces of old bedding and 144,400 jin of cotton and cloth scraps were allocated to the state to help disaster victims. This year, due to the reduction in the logistics budget, coupled with the insufficient supply of raw materials, the supply of some military equipment cannot fully meet the needs of various units. Therefore, it is even more necessary to make the best use of everything. In addition to conscientiously doing a good job in collecting waste and old materials, logistics departments at all levels will thoroughly clean up warehouse materials, uniformly allocate existing equipment among units, and require officers and soldiers to use various equipment rationally, using as little as possible, substituting where possible, and repairing and continuing to use what can be repaired, in order to solve the problem of insufficient supply of certain military equipment. In addition, in order to save fuel, the entire army will strictly limit the use of vehicles this year, and will use carts, ships, and trains as much as possible to transport materials, which is expected to save more than 12,600 tons of vehicle fuel compared to last year.

General Hong Xuezhi said that some supply standards were not perfect in the past, and have been appropriately revised after repeated investigation and research. Simply lowering the supply standard for military horse feed can save more than 50 million jin of grain throughout the year. After reducing the horse feed, as long as measures such as feeding more when in use, feeding less when not in use, and regularly grazing and cutting forage are taken, the health of military horses can still be maintained. Regarding saving military grain, according to statistics from troops stationed in seven regions including Lanzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, Jinan, and Fuzhou, a total of 13 million jin of grain was saved last year; this year, the entire army has launched a campaign to save one liang of rice per person per day, and it is expected that even greater achievements can be made. At the same time, all units are universally engaged in sideline production such as reclaiming wasteland for planting vegetables and raising pigs, in order to reduce the supply of non-staple foods to the garrison from various localities, and to enable the troops to appropriately improve their lives through their own labor. This year, the logistics department will also comprehensively promote the experience of improving stoves to save coal, and call on the entire army to gradually reduce the coal used for cooking from 1.6 jin per person per day to less than 1 jin. In addition, the clothing supply standards for officers at all levels have also been decided to be appropriately reduced by extending the service life.

General Hong Xuezhi finally told reporters that the entire officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have a fine tradition of hard work, plain living, and sharing weal and woe with the people. Therefore, the various savings measures proposed by the logistics department to implement the policy of "building the army through diligence and thrift" have won the enthusiastic support and active support of the vast number of officers and soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd – In the mass savings campaign, various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are taking various specific measures to tap the potential for savings.

Logistics personnel in various units are finding ways and methods in all aspects to save materials and funds for the country. The logistics department of the troops stationed in the Beijing area recently investigated the savings potential of the troops and proposed several savings measures: changing the transportation of materials from trucks to horse-drawn carts, which can save 400,000 kilograms of fuel throughout the year; pouring out the residual fuel from the empty oil drums returned from various units, which can reduce the loss of 30,000 to 40,000 kilograms of fuel throughout the year; conscientiously collecting packaging materials, which can save 2.47 million yuan throughout the year; extending the service life of various types of camp equipment in various units by one year each, which can save 1.1 million yuan; and uniformly allocating the stockpiled materials of various units and making full use of waste and old materials, which can also save a large amount of expenses. A certain ordnance warehouse of the troops stationed in the Nanjing area thoroughly adjusted the inventory of materials, freeing up more than ten empty warehouses, which can store an additional 2,443 tons of materials. The logistics department of a certain naval unit replaced imported cork with rattan cores to make a batch of fenders for ships. These rattan core fenders are elastic, light, durable, and cost less than one-eighth of the cost of cork fenders.

Many agencies, schools, and troops have reduced their construction plans and mobilized the masses to discuss ways to save money in construction. A certain public security army school originally planned to overspend 290,000 yuan according to the original construction plan. Now, due to the reduction of projects such as clubs, nurseries, and family guest houses, the budget does not need to be increased. After discussion by the masses, a certain construction unit can save more than 290,000 yuan in the material supply alone. In order to save construction costs, officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in the Liangshan area, led by the unit leaders, built their own barracks, saving the country more than 1,400 yuan. A certain naval unit revised the engineering design plan for four warehouses, saving nearly 10,000 yuan.

Many military schools and troops have put forward the slogan of "building the army diligently and thriftily," saving military education expenses in all aspects. Under the premise of ensuring teaching effectiveness and practicing strict economy, the Military Academy decided to appropriately reduce the number of live-fire exercises, reduce the number of detachments and vehicles participating in the exercises, and reduce the ammunition consumption in the exercises. A certain unit stationed in the Wuhan area stipulated that future military education equipment should be mainly self-made, wooden targets for live ammunition shooting should be replaced with second-class cloth and bamboo mats as much as possible, and barbed wire for exercises should be made of straw rope. Many troops carefully picked up the shell casings and wooden handles of hand grenades one by one after the exercises, and also used broken glass and ammunition boxes to make their own aiming inspection mirrors, and repaired all training equipment that could be repaired and continued to be used.

Now, the atmosphere of thrift and economy is constantly rising in all units of the People's Liberation Army. The Political Academy sends less heating for four hours every day, consuming about 15 tons less coal per day; after strengthening electricity management, this academy has added more than ten buildings recently, but the daily electricity consumption has decreased by more than 300 degrees. A certain military school stationed in Luoyang stipulates that each person should save 1.5 liang of grain per day according to the current standard, and mobilizes all personnel to pay attention to collecting waste products, and officers and students clean up themselves to reduce the number of odd-job personnel, etc. A certain unit stationed in the Guangzhou area took measures such as merging offices and adding beds to single officers' dormitories to solve the difficulty of insufficient barracks. The ordnance department of the troops stationed in the Jinan area used discarded old forms as office paper and reprinted forms on the reverse side, saving 600 yuan.

    艰苦朴素与人民同甘共苦
    解放军缩减后勤费三分之一
    各部队积极采取措施节省物资和资金
    新华社24日讯　新华社记者就中国人民解放军“勤俭建军”的具体措施问题，日前访问了解放军总后勤部长洪学智上将。
    洪学智上将对记者说：厉行节约、防止浪费，是今年军队后勤工作的重要任务。根据国家缩减军政费用、加强经济建设的方针，今年的全军后勤事业费比去年减少了将近三分之一。我们全军后勤工作人员完全拥护这个决定。只要发动全体指战员积极想办法，从各方面发掘潜力，是完全能够少花钱把事情办好的。军队的各级后勤部门本着“勤俭建军”的精神，正在采取一系列既能节省开支、又能保证必需供应的措施。
    洪学智上将说，军队后勤部门的节约潜力是很大的。单是被服的领新缴旧一项，就能为国家节约大量财富。去年收缴的旧被服在军需生产中重新利用，就节省了九百一十万元，另外还把旧被服七十四万六千多件和棉花、布片十四万四千多斤拨给国家救济灾民。今年由于后勤事业费减少，加上原材料供不应求，有些军用器材的供应量不能充分满足各部队需要，为此更要做到物尽其用。各级后勤部门除了认真做好废旧物资的收缴工作以外，还将彻底清理仓库物资，对部队现有器材统一调剂、互通有无，并要求部队官兵合理使用各种器材，能少用的尽量少用，能代用的设法代用，能修补的修补后继续使用，以解决某些军用器材的供应不足问题。此外，为了节约油料，今年全军严格限制汽车使用，尽量利用马车、船只和火车来运输物资，预计可以比去年节约汽车用油一万二千六百多吨。
    洪学智上将说，有些供给标准过去不够完善，经过反复调查研究，作了适当修改。仅是降低军马马料的供给标准一项，全年就可以节省粮食五千多万斤。马料减少以后，只要采取使用时多喂、不用时少喂、经常放青和割草料等办法，仍可保持军马健康。关于节约军队用粮，去年根据驻兰州、成都、武汉、济南、福州等七个地区的部队统计，共节余粮食一千三百万斤；今年全军已开展每人每日节约一两米运动，预计可作出更大成绩。同时，各部队正在普遍从事开荒种菜和养猪等副业生产，以减少各地对驻军的副食品供应，并使部队用自己的劳动来适当改善生活。后勤部门今年还将全面推广改进炉灶节约烧煤的经验，号召全军把炊事用煤从每人每天一斤六两逐渐降低到一斤以内。此外，各级军官的服装供给标准，也决定采取延长使用年限等办法适当降低。
    洪学智上将最后对记者说，中国人民解放军的全体官兵，是具有艰苦朴素、与人民同甘共苦的优良传统的。所以后勤部门为贯彻“勤俭建军”方针所提出的各项节约措施，获得了广大官兵的热烈拥护和积极支持。
    新华社23日讯　中国人民解放军各部队在群众性的节约运动中，正在采取各种具体措施发掘节约潜力。
    各部队的后勤工作人员从各方面找窍门、想办法，为国家节省物资和资金。驻北京地区部队的后勤部门最近调查了部队的节约潜力，提出几项节约措施：将原来用汽车运输的物资改为用马车运输，全年可以节省油料四十万公斤；从各部队缴回的空油桶中将残存油料倒干净，全年可以少损耗油料三万到四万公斤；认真收集包装用具，全年可以节约二百四十七万元；各部队营具的使用年限每种延长一年，可以节约一百一十万元；统一调剂使用各部队的积压物资和充分利用废旧物资，也可以节省很大一笔开支。驻南京地区部队的某军械仓库彻底调整了库存物资，腾出空库十多座，可以多存放物资二千四百四十三吨。海军某部后勤部门改用藤心代替进口货软木做了一批舰艇上的碰垫，这种藤心碰垫弹性强、轻巧、耐用，成本还不到软木碰垫的八分之一。
    许多机关、学校、部队缩减了修建计划，并发动群众讨论施工中的节约办法。某公安军学校按原来建筑计划超支二十九万元，现在由于削减俱乐部、托儿所、家属招待所等工程，预算可以不必追加。某施工部队经过群众讨论，单是材料供应一项，就可以节约二十九万多元。为了节省建筑费用，驻凉山地区某部官兵在部队首长带领下，自己动手修建营房，为国家节约了一千四百多元。海军某部队修正了四座仓库的工程设计方案，节省将近一万元。
    许多军事学校和部队提出“勤俭练兵”的口号，从各方面节省军事教育费用。军事学院在保证教学效果和厉行节约的前提下，决定适当减少实兵演习的次数，紧缩参加演习的分队和车辆数量，并减少演习中的弹药消耗。驻武汉地区某部规定了今后的军事教育器材以自制为主，实弹射击用的木板靶尽量以次布和竹席代替，演习用的铁丝网改用草绳制作。许多部队在演习以后细心地把弹壳和手榴弹的木把一个个拣起来，还利用碎玻璃和子弹箱自制瞄准检查镜，把修补以后可以继续使用的训练器材都进行了修补。
    现在，俭朴节约的风气正在解放军各单位中不断上升。政治学院每天少送暖气四小时，每天少消耗煤十五吨左右；这个学院加强用电管理以后，近来虽然增加楼房十多幢，每日用电却减少了三百多度。驻洛阳某军事学校规定每人每天按现行标准节约粮食一两半，发动全校人员注意搜集废品，由军官、学员自己动手打扫以减少勤杂人员等。驻广州地区某部采取合并办公室、单身军官宿舍增加床位等办法，解决了营房不够的困难。驻济南地区部队军械处利用作废的旧表册当办公纸和在反面重印表格，节省了六百元。
