    The Civil Engineering Team's Deputy Leader Who Does More With Less
	Xiao Ding
    Ao Baocheng was originally an administrator at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's earthworks company. In October of last year, he was transferred to the Second Civil Engineering Team as deputy leader, responsible for managing daily life and welfare matters.

    Soon after he took office, two civil workers got into a fight in the construction site canteen. The reason was that one worker spilled a bowl of soup when another worker bumped into him. Words were exchanged, and the two started fighting. Later, the team disciplined the two men.

    This construction site canteen could only accommodate six hundred people at a time, but now there were over a thousand. Every mealtime, the canteen was so crowded that it was impossible to move around, and dishes were often knocked over, or people were splashed with soup, causing disputes. To avoid such disputes, the canteen had to be expanded. But Ao Baocheng calculated that building a new canteen with reed mats would cost six or seven hundred yuan, which was too expensive. There were many old bamboo poles and reed mats that had been taken down from the construction site. If the workers were mobilized to pick them up and the company provided some more, couldn't the existing canteen be expanded? As a result, the team followed his method and spent only a little over a hundred yuan to accomplish something worth six or seven hundred yuan. The canteen was expanded by a third, and the kitchen was also enlarged, which pleased both the workers and the cooks.

    The problem of canteen crowding was solved, but the workers still had complaints about the food, saying that it was expensive, the portions were small, and the quality was poor. The kitchen staff believed that the food seemed less and more expensive because the original plates were too deep, making the portions appear smaller. They requested to buy several hundred shallow plates. Ao Baocheng laughed when he heard this: "Plates costing five or six jiao each, a hundred plates would cost fifty or sixty yuan. Spending so much money wouldn't solve the problem of the food being better or more plentiful, and what's the point of just showing off?" Then, he calculated the costs with the cooks: How much does a jin of turnips cost? How much turnip and oil is needed for a five-fen plate of braised turnips? He asked them to find specific ways to ensure the quality and quantity of the food. He also went into the kitchen to check how they were portioning out the food and rice. After that, the food in the canteen greatly improved. The workers said, "The current five-fen plate of food is like the one-jiao plate of food in the past."

    Winter arrived. The sheds built in the summer had no doors, so the workers used their bed boards as doors to block the wind, resulting in a shortage of bed boards. Making wooden doors would be difficult, as wood was in short supply for the entire Wuhan Iron and Steel project, and even reed mats were quite scarce. What to do? One day, he passed by the construction site and saw a pile of old bamboo poles that had been taken down and were not being used. He requested the company to use these bamboo poles to make doors, and the doors were then coated with mud and straw, which turned out to be even better than reed mat doors.

    In addition to helping the workers solve many daily life and welfare problems based on the principle of spending less, Ao Baocheng also frequently conducted education on diligence and thrift among the workers. Some workers were not good at managing their money and would recklessly buy unnecessary things or go to small restaurants to eat meat and drink alcohol after receiving their wages. He would help the workers calculate their income and expenses, reminding them not to waste. Now, under the leadership of the Party branch, the entire team has launched an education campaign on "diligence and thrift." The civil workers of the Fifth Squad, who previously had no savings, have now deposited more than a thousand yuan in the bank.

    Ao Baocheng not only encourages others to be diligent and thrifty, but his own lifestyle is also very simple. He eats every day in the construction site canteen with the civil workers. In the evening, he always goes to the sheds to see if the workers are sleeping well. When he first arrived, the team's cadres and permanent workers often went directly to the kitchen to buy food, while the civil workers had to queue outside the window, which the civil workers had objections to. He immediately said at a cadre meeting, "This will affect the relationship between cadres and the masses, and it will affect the relationship between workers and peasants." At his suggestion, the canteen added another window, and the cadres and permanent workers also queued outside the window to buy food, and he queued with them himself.

    少花钱多办事的民工副队长	肖定
    敖保成原是武钢工地土方公司的管理员，去年10月调到民工第二大队担任副队长，负责管理生活福利方面的工作。
    他刚到职，工地饭堂里就有两个民工打架。原因是一个民工端碗汤被另一个民工撞洒了，言语不对，两人便打开了。后来，大队处分了这两个人。
    这个工地饭堂只能容纳六百人吃饭，现在却有一千多人。每次开饭，饭堂里就挤得转不开身，经常是这个的菜被撞翻了，那个被泼了一身汤，引起纠纷。要避免这类纠纷，就必须扩大食堂。但是敖保成一计算：如果搭个芦席棚的新饭堂，就得六、七百元，花钱太多。工地上拆下来的旧竹子、旧芦席很多，发动工人去拣一些，再向公司要一些，不就可以把原有的饭堂扩大了吗？结果，大队按照他这个办法，只用了一百多元就办了六、七百元的事，饭堂扩大了三分之一，厨房也扩大了些，工人和炊事员都挺满意。
    饭堂拥挤问题解决了，但工人对饭菜还有意见，说价钱贵，量少，质也差。厨房的同志认为菜贵、量少是由于原来的菜盘底子太深，显的菜装不满，要求买几百个浅底盘子。敖保成一听就笑起来了：“五、六角钱一个的盘子，一百个就得五、六十元。花这么多钱，也不能解决菜好、菜多的问题，而且光摆排场有什么用呢？”接着，他又同炊事员算账：萝卜多少钱一斤？五分钱一盘的烧萝卜得用多少萝卜多少油？要他们具体设法保证菜的质和量。他又深入厨房去检查他们分菜、分饭的情况。以后，饭堂的饭菜就有了很大改善。工人们说：“现在的五分钱一盘的菜，跟过去一角钱的菜一样。”
    冬天到了。夏天搭的工棚没有门，民工们便将铺板用来作门挡风，结果弄得铺板又不够了。做个木门吧，武钢整个工程的木料紧张得很，连芦席都挺缺。怎么办呢？有一天，他路过工地，见一堆拆下来的旧竹子没人用，便请求公司把这堆竹子用来做门，门上再涂上泥巴和稻草，结果比芦席门还好。
    敖保成除了根据少花钱的原则，帮助工人解决了不少生活福利问题以外，还经常在工人当中进行勤俭节约的教育。有的工人不会精打细算，一发工资，就胡乱买些不必要的东西，或上小馆吃肉喝酒。他就帮助工人算收支的账，提醒工人不要浪费。现在，全大队在党支部领导下已经展开了“勤俭节约”的教育。原来一个钱也没积蓄的第五中队的民工，已经在银行里存了一千多元。
    敖保成不仅劝别人勤俭节约，自己的生活作风也很简朴。他每天都在工地饭堂同民工们一起吃饭。晚上，他总要到工棚里去走走，看民工们睡的好不好。他刚来时，队里的干部和固定工人时常直接跑到厨房去买菜饭，而民工们却要在窗口外面排队，民工有意见。他马上在一次干部会上讲：“这样会影响干部和群众的关系，会影响工人和农民的关系。”在他的建议下，饭堂又搞了一个窗口，干部和固定工人也都在窗口外面排队买菜饭，他自己也和他们排在一起。
