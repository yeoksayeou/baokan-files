Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 9th: The Second Representative Congress of the China Democratic League Hubei Provincial Organization, which lasted for three days, concluded on the 8th.

　　This meeting focused on discussing how to implement the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." The meeting criticized the view that supervision could not be carried out if the leadership of the Communist Party was accepted. It believed that only under the premise of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, could the China Democratic League organizations carry out mutual criticism and mutual assistance between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, making the relationship of cooperation and working together more perfect, so as to achieve common progress and jointly run the socialist cause of the motherland well. The meeting also held that the China Democratic League organizations must strengthen independent thinking and initiative in their work, consult with the Communist Party organizations more on matters of principle, and frequently reflect the opinions and demands of the League members and the masses they are connected with to the Communist Party organizations and the government.

　　The meeting also criticized the view held by some League members that the primary task of the China Democratic League organizations was to supervise the Communist Party organizations. The meeting held that the current basic task of the China Democratic League is still to unite and transform intellectuals, and it is on this basis that it should play a supervisory role over the Communist Party organizations.

　　The meeting also discussed the issue of working with those in the middle, especially those who are lagging behind. It believed that this work is glorious, and the phenomenon of being unwilling to approach those in the middle and those who are lagging behind, and demanding excessively high and harsh conditions for their joining the League, should be changed.

　　Finally, the meeting elected Nie Guoqing, Zhou Jie, Ma Zhemin, and other fifty-seven people as members and alternate members of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, forming a new leadership structure for the local organizations of the China Democratic League in Hubei Province.

　　During the meeting, Hu Jinkui, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Meng Futang, Minister of the Department of Culture and Education, delivered reports on the Party's united front policy and cultural and educational policies, and put forward suggestions for improving the work of the local organizations of the China Democratic League in Hubei Province.

    民盟湖北省组织第二次代表大会闭幕
    新华社武汉9日电　中国民主同盟湖北省第二次代表大会开了三天，已经在8日闭幕。
    这次会议着重讨论了如何贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”方针的问题。会议批判了那种认为接受共产党的领导就不能进行监督的说法，认为民盟组织只有在接受共产党的领导的前提下，开展共产党与各民主党派之间的相互批评，相互帮助，使合作共事的关系更趋完善，才能达到共同进步，共同把祖国社会主义事业办好的目的。会议还认为，民盟组织在工作中必须加强独立思考和主动创造精神，在原则问题上应当多与共产党组织协商，并且应当经常向共产党组织和政府反映盟员及其联系的群众的意见和要求。
    会议还批判了部分盟员认为民盟组织对共产党组织进行监督是首要任务的说法。会议认为，民盟当前的基本任务仍然是团结和改造知识分子，要在这个基础上对共产党组织起监督作用。
    会议还讨论了对中间尤其是对后进分子进行工作的问题。认为这个工作是光荣的，那种不愿意接近中间和后进分子，向他们要求的入盟条件过高过苛的现象，应该改变。
    会议最后选出聂国青、周杰、马哲民等五十七人为民盟湖北省委员会委员和候补委员，组成了民盟湖北省地方组织新的领导机构。
    会议期间，中共湖北省委员会统战部部长胡金魁、文教部部长孟夫唐就党的统一战线政策和文教政策作了报告，并对改进民盟湖北省地方组织的工作提出了建议。
