    Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The head of the State Council's Government Offices Administration Bureau told Xinhua News Agency reporters today that central government agencies and organizations have significantly reduced their administrative expenses this year. The average public expenditure per person is halved compared to last year, which could save the state 40 million yuan annually.
    The head said that many unit leaders personally led the review of administrative expenses last year, and based on the allocated quotas, they meticulously budgeted this year with the principle of doing more with limited funds. Leaders of units such as the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also personally gave mobilization reports on savings to all staff, carefully calculated and allocated various expenses. They not only compressed various expenditures, but also proposed many specific saving measures and formulated strict management methods. Many units also thoroughly carried out inventory work, tried every means to utilize old materials and waste products, stipulated that no office supplies would be purchased for six months or a year, and that all furniture would no longer be purchased, and any surplus must be handed over for allocation.
    The head said that the three largest expenses in the central government agencies' public funds over the years—travel, telecommunications, and meetings—have been greatly reduced through strict control. The Ministry of Internal Affairs originally planned to hold fourteen national professional meetings in the first quarter. After repeated study by the leadership, they believed that some meetings could be canceled, some could be postponed or combined. As a result, only four meetings were held to solve the problems. A meeting currently being held by the State Economic Commission was originally intended to cost more than 80,000 yuan. Because it was changed to be held in the office, the cost of hotels and transportation was saved, reducing expenses by 60,000 yuan. The number of participants in the meeting has also been greatly streamlined. Last year, more than 400 people attended the meeting of department and bureau directors held by the Ministry of Commerce. This year, there are only more than 50 people. All kinds of meetings generally stopped entertaining with watching plays, movies, banquets, or garden parties. In terms of saving telecommunications fees, some units with large telecommunications expenses have taken various measures to strictly control them, resulting in a significant decline in this expenditure. The Ministry of Commerce sent an average of more than 400 telegrams per month in November and December last year, but only 91 telegrams were sent in January this year. Many non-urgent matters were replaced with written documents. The ministry spent more than 41,000 yuan on telegrams alone in December last year, but only more than 2,900 yuan in January this year. Recently, almost all central-level agencies and enterprises have reduced the number and amount of telegrams sent.
    The head of the State Council's Government Offices Administration Bureau said that as a result of the vigorous implementation of economy by various units, administrative expenses in January only amounted to more than 13 million yuan, a decrease of more than 5 million yuan compared with the same period last year. Judging from the implementation of quota indicators by various units in January, there is great potential for saving administrative expenses. He requested all units to continue to mobilize the masses in depth and find ways to save more funds for the state.

    精打细算缩减行政经费开支
    中央机关团体全年可节省四千万元
    新华社16日讯　国务院机关事务管理局负责人今天对新华社记者说，中央各机关、团体大量缩减今年的行政经费开支，每人平均需用的公用费比去年减少了一半，全年可以为国家节省资金四千万元。
    这位负责人说，有许多单位的负责人亲自领导检查去年行政经费的开支情况，并根据分配的定额指标，本着以有限的钱多办事的原则，精打细算，编制今年的预算。铁道部、煤炭工业部、中共中央办公厅等单位的负责人还亲自向全体工作人员作关于节约的动员报告，认真核算和分配各项费用，不仅对各项开支作了压缩，还提出了许多节约的具体措施，订出了严格的管理办法。不少单位还彻底进行了清仓工作，想尽办法利用旧存物资和废品，规定半年或一年内不购置任何办公用品，各种家具也一律不再购置，多余的必须交出来调剂。
    这位负责人说，历年来中央机关公用费中开支最大的差旅、电讯、会议等三项费用，经过严格控制，都有了很大减缩，内务部第一季度原计划召开十四个全国性专业会议，经过领导上反复研究以后，认为一些会可以不开，一些会可以缓开或合并举行，结果，只开四个会就可以解决问题。国家经济委员会正在举行的一个会议，原打算花八万多元，由于改在机关里开，省去了旅馆和交通等费用，少用了六万元。参加会议的人数也大大精简，去年商业部召开的厅局长会议，有四百多人参加，今年只有五十多人。各种会议一般都停止了招待看戏、看电影、会餐或游园。在节约电讯费方面，一些电讯费开支较大的单位都采取各种办法严格控制，使这项开支有了显著下降。商业部去年11、12月份每月平均拍发电报四百多次，今年1月份只拍发九十一次，许多不是紧急的事情都用行文代替了。这个部去年12月份光电报费就用了四万一千多元，今年1月份只用了二千九百多元。近来，几乎所有中央级机关、企业都减少了拍发电报的次数和金额。
    国务院机关事务管理局负责人说，由于各个单位厉行节约的结果，1月份行政经费只开支了一千三百多万元，比去年同期减少了五百多万元。根据各个单位1月份对定额指标的执行情况看，行政经费的节约潜力很大。他要求各单位继续深入发动群众，想办法为国家节省更多的资金。
