Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd. Vice Premier of the State Council, Bo Yibo, delivered a report this morning to all the representatives attending the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference on the achievements of our country's production and construction last year, this year's tasks, and issues such as strengthening the worker-peasant alliance.

In his report, Bo Yibo called on the attending representatives and farmers across the country to support the country's socialist industrialization on the basis of developing agricultural production and running cooperatives well. He particularly emphasized consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and developing worker-peasant friendship. Mutual support and assistance between industry and agriculture, and the close alliance between workers and peasants, are the fundamental guarantees for building socialism.
