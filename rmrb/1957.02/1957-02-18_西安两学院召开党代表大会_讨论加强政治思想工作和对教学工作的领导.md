Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 17th. The Communist Party organizations of Xi'an Aviation College and Northwestern Polytechnical University recently held their respective Party Congresses, focusing on discussions to strengthen the Party's political and ideological work in the schools and to strengthen leadership in teaching work.

The First Party Congress convened by the Communist Party organization of Xi'an Aviation College analyzed the overall political and ideological situation of the college, believing that the thinking of the faculty, staff, and students was basically healthy. The broad masses of intellectuals could consciously unite around the Party and actively work and study. However, due to the rapid development of the college and changes in the domestic and international situation, coupled with the fact that political and ideological work had not kept pace with the rapidly developing objective situation, the petty-bourgeois ideological sentiments of some individuals had risen. Their personal plans were numerous, and their socialist enthusiasm was not high. This situation was also reflected within the Party. The Congress believed that the school Party organization must strengthen political and ideological leadership in the future. In this semester, it is necessary to do a good job in carrying out ideological education on increasing production and practicing economy and on revolutionary traditions, establishing a fine style of hard work and simplicity, overcoming difficulties, and overcoming all kinds of petty-bourgeois individualism. The meeting also emphasized the need to strengthen the Party's leadership and supervision of teaching work.

The Second Party Congress of the Communist Party of Northwestern Polytechnical University, held in early February, focused on discussing the issues of strengthening the Party's leadership and improving teaching quality. The meeting proposed the task of improving teaching quality: first, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's political and ideological work, educate all members of the college to enhance their political awareness, overcome various unhealthy thoughts, and give full play to their work enthusiasm. The key to improving teaching quality lies in strengthening leadership and improving the level of teachers. Since most of the college's teachers are young teachers, they should systematically summarize teaching experience in the future, strengthen the organizational leadership of various teaching and research groups in teachers' teaching work and further study their professional work, and enrich library materials.

    西安两学院召开党代表大会
    讨论加强政治思想工作和对教学工作的领导
    新华社西安17日电　西安航空学院和西北工学院的中共党组织，最近分别召开党的代表大会，着重讨论了加强党在学校的政治思想工作和加强对教学工作的领导。
    中共西安航空学院党组织召开的第一次代表大会，对全院的政治思想情况作了分析，认为全院师生员工的思想基本是健康的，广大的知识分子都能自觉的团结在党的周围，积极地工作、学习。但由于学院迅速发展和国内外形势的变化，加上政治思想工作还不能和迅速发展着的客观形势相适应，因此，部分人员的小资产阶级思想情绪有所抬头，他们的个人打算多，社会主义热情不高，这种情况在党内也有反映。代表大会认为学校党组织今后必须加强政治思想领导。在这一学期必须作好开展增产节约和进行革命传统的思想教育，树立艰苦朴素、克服困难的优良作风，克服形形色色的小资产阶级个人主义的思想。会议还强调要加强党对教学工作的领导和监督。
    在2月上旬召开的中共西北工学院第二次党代表大会，着重讨论了加强党的领导，提高教学质量问题。会议提出提高教学质量的任务：首先必须加强党的政治思想工作，教育全院人员提高政治觉悟，克服各种不健康的思想，发挥工作积极性。提高教学质量的关键在于加强领导和提高教师的水平。由于学院大部分是青年教师，今后应系统地总结教学经验，加强各教研组对教师教学工作和进修业务的组织领导工作，充实图书资料等。
